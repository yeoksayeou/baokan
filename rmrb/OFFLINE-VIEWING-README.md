# Viewing the People's Daily Offline

If you download this repository and wish to view all the files offline, please note that you will need to first decompress all the data files. 

Look in the "data" folder here in the "rmrb" folder and you will see a large collection of .js.gz files. Decompress each of these so that they have ".js" at the end. Then you may use the index.html page to browse these.

If you get an error "An error occurred while displaying days for ..." then it is likely because it cannot find the .js file for that month in your data folder. Make sure it is decompressed and has the apprioprate name (e.g. 1970.07.js and so on).
