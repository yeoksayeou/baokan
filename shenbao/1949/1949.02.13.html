<h3>李代總統定明晚廣播　重申政碎謀和決心　顏惠慶邵力子今晨飛平</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十二日廣播南京訊：李代總統定於十四日晚發表重要廣播，重申政府與共黨謀取和平之決心。預料李代總統之廣播演詞將以極堅强之措詞，重申政府不遺餘力，以獲取和平之決心。該項聲明將廓淸關於最近廣東方面所傳政府有繼續作戰意向之誤會。該項傳說謂，李代總統已同意孫科之作戰政策，李代總統之廣播，料將强調政府首要之目標仍爲和平。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕甘介侯昨日午後接獲北平長途電話，請和平代表團於今日飛平，甘氏已於昨晚六時通知顏惠慶氏轉告各團員，準備出發，今晨各代表仍照以往約定，於九時集中顏寓，候機飛平。邵力子同機前往。彼等將與中共首要交換意見。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕張治中辭和談代表事，總統府方面十二日尙未接獲報告，據政界人士稱：張氏之辭呈，殆係向行政院提出，因和談代表爲政院所派也。張氏辭職原因未詳，張氏在蘭且以稱病聞，據觀察，最近中共方面對和談代表頗多攻擊，張氏亦不例外，當此和平前途尙難預卜之際，和談代表即受抨擊，可能爲張氏辭職之主因。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕此間今對中共葉劍英向南京人民和平代表團保證共黨將於本月內答應召開和談及於和談最後結果決定之前不向京滬及長江沿棧攻擊二項，顯示目前全國人民切盼和平之呼籲，業已促使共黨不能漠視全國民意，但一般認爲在共軍未正式下令停戰以前，對和平前途仍未敢抱持過分之樂觀。依據目前種種跡象，江北共軍正在積極整備補充，但葉劍英表示一月內不向京滬及長江沿岸進攻，亦當爲可信之事實，今晨人民和平代表團邱致中會晋謁李代總統，報告赴平與中共人士接談經過，該代表團所携回之中共方面意見，邱氏於晋謁時，會於口頭上轉達。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十二日電〕據探息：葉劍英將軍已向南京教授和平代表團保證，共黨將於本月內答應召開和談，並於最後結果決定前，不向京滬及長江沿綫攻擊。該消息稱：葉要求代表團轉告南京對開始和談的「幾件必要條件」。但未透露「必要條件」之性質，惟表示其中包括要求停止備戰行動。該代表團在平並得下列印象：（一）共黨認爲李宗仁在和平協定的交涉中，力不足代表國民黨，並將使政府內部分裂。（二）共黨允對「懲辦戰犯」要求作某種修改。（三）共黨將不要求拘留或審判蔣總統。（四）共黨對政府軍改編問題，將除去苛嚴條件。吳裕後引葉劍英言稱：「如果國民黨誠意求和，則中共願使和平儘速實現」。吳氏並透露葉劍英及其他共黨領袖已將具體和平條件細則交代表團轉達政府。吳氏稱：「在適當時期」代表團將發表全部報告。</p>
<h3>入睡時服安眼藥過多　戴傳賢在穗逝世　中常會昨討論治喪事宜</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十二日電〕黨國元老戴傳賢，突於十二日晨八時在穗東山東園逝世·查氏向患心臟病·每晚需服安眠藥始能入睡·來穗後亦然。昨晚或係進服安眠藥過多·以致影響心贓。今晨發覺後·先由中山大學醫學院主任施救·繼市衛生局長朱廣陶亦馳至、惟已不及。國民黨中常會卽于下午四時舉行會議、商討治喪事宜。氏逝世前一日尙有表示入川意，一且溘逝，聞者震慟。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕此間獲悉、前考試院長戴傳賢於逝世之前一晚，會與其夫人同進催眠藥後安睡，戴氏係十二日晨八時不起，夫人尙在醫院診治中。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十二日電〕監察院長于右任，立法院長童冠賢於十二日最離穗前，聞悉黨國元老戴傳賢病危消息，特于戴氏彌留之際，至牀側探視，流連良久，悵然談別。于氏更不禁老淚縱橫，內心實無限悲慟。</p>
<p>戴氏略歷</p>
<p>戴傳賢字季陶，浙江吳興人，生於四川廣漢縣，十五歲東渡留學。民元前三年，卒業於日本大學。回國任江蘇地方目治研究所教習一年，庚戌辛亥間，任上海中外日報，天鐸報，檳榔嶼光華報主筆，較吹革命思想，在檳榔嶼時，參加同盟會，迨武漢革命重起，回國，致力於東北革命運助。民國一元年，任民懼報主筆。時國父孫中山先生主持全國鐵路事，任爲秘書，翌年春，隨孫先生訪日。是年冬，討袁失敗，轉赴東北，謀革命不成，再赴日，助中山先生组織中華革命黨，任浙江支部長，並任民國雜誌主筆。五年，隨　中山先生歸國，六年，任大元帥府秘書長，外交部次長。八年，主辦上海星期評論，並與胡展堂·廖仲愷·朱執信·諸先生襄助中山先生主持建設雜誌。十一年，奉總理命回四川，勸慰各軍罷戰，興實業。十二年，大本營成立後奉大元帥命兼任爲法制委員會委員長。十三年，國民黨改組，第一次全國代表大會被選爲中央執行委員兼宣傳部長，中央政治委員會委員，黃埔軍官學校政治部長。十四年，國民政府成立任國民政府委負。十五年，任中山大學委員長。十六年春，奉命使日，返國後改任中山大學校長，並兼任宣傳部委員，中央政治會議委員，總司令部政治訓練部主任。十七年，被選任爲國民政府委員兼考試院院長，直至三十七年憲法頒布後，總統府成立時，始卸職。十八年，兼任訓練部長。二十年，中央組織特種外交委負會，任爲委員長。第四次全國代表大會再選任爲中央執行委員兼政治會議委負。三十七年六月，繼張繼為國史館館長。氏著作等身，頗多散佚，其著者，如「三民主義之哲學基礎」，「靑年之路」，「國民革命與中國國民黨」，「日本論」等，尤膾炙人口，爲資年所愛讀。公子安國，會留比學電機，現任交通部民航局局長。</p>
<h3>由聯合國調解我戰事　賴伊表示不反對　澳外長考慮正式提建議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十一日電〕據悉：澳洲外長及聯合國大會主席伊瓦特，正在考慮建議聯合國出面調停解決中國內戰。據訊：伊氏對此尙未有最後之決議。此間澳代表團方面稱：彼等并未接獲伊氏之訓令，要求聯合國調解，然伊氏會於本月初以長途電話與聯合國秘書長賴伊討論聯合國調解中國事件之可能性。賴伊與伊瓦特於去年年底會合作企圖解決希臘內戰及柏林危機然，此次賴伊對伊氏之建議則不置可否，但賴氏暗示渠對伊氏以澳洲外長身份要求聯合國調解并不反對。按伊氏將於四月五日聯大揭幕時出任主席，澳方傳稱：伊氏認爲「若中國之長期及悲慘戰爭使全國受害無窮，延宕復興及恢復，此乃中國受災之人民所應享之權利者，若嚴格遵照聯合國原則，協助調解以促成同意之和平，將挽救無數人民之生命」。假如伊氏提出此一建議，渠似將要求根據聯合國憲章第十四條提出調解，卽聯大對任何局勢得以建議和平調整辦法。</p>
<h3>「蔣總裁的心境」　南京中央日報昨日社論</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕京中央日報十二日社論，題爲：「蔣總裁的心境」，全文如次：</p>
<p>溪口通信說，總裁蔣先生這次回鄕，度過新年，在此初春時候，會由溪口步行至奉化縣城，並暢遊天童寺，瞻仰方外舊友入指頭陀的冷香塔。總裁步行所至，備受村鎮居民的敬禮和歡呼，總裁心情之愉快恬適，為三十年來所未有。</p>
<p>自總裁於一月二十一日離京返里以來，黨中同志常以總裁今後的作法爲念。我們以爲解答這一問題，第一必須理解總裁的人生觀，第二必須理解總裁今日的地位。我們如果對於這兩點有了正確的理解，就不會對總裁的出處作錯誤的和不必要的揣測了。</p>
<p>蔣先生持躬處事，始終一貫以義務感與責任心爲出發點，他早歲迫隨總理，不論職位，不求聞達，只求他對於革命能够盡心竭力。民國十三年，總理創辦黃埔軍校，任蔣先生爲校長，于經費·械彈十分困難之中，養成了國民革命軍的中堅幹部，完成了統一廣東，出師北伐的大業，在寗漢分裂之前蔣先生功成不居，絜身引退，以促成本黨的團結。自國民政府定都南京以後，每遭變亂，縱令其不得已而用兵，但其結果無不因蔣先生容忍退讓而得到和平的解決。九一八事變發生以後，蔣先生第二度下野，以喚起國人團結禦侮，而對於中共更在江西剿匪勝利之後，以和平的，政治的方法促成其共赴國難，抗日戰事初告結束，國民政府威望之隆，爲歷史上空前所未有，而總裁以國民政府主席的地位致電中共，邀請毛澤東來渝，共商和平建國的大計，繼之以　治協商會議，首先提出改組國民政府，結束訓政的方案，充分表現忍讓爲國的精神，中共於破壞政協決議與整軍方案之後，發動全面叛亂，造成兵運禍結的險惡局勢，總裁乃於今年元旦發表文告，重申和平解決的方針，更第三度絜身引退，以促成和平商談之平日開始。綜觀總裁五十年革命的事略，特別是以進退出處的大節，證明了他沒有一件事不以義務感與資任心爲出發點，只要我們對此有正確的理解，就不難知道總裁今日在一方面雖以國家的獨立與人民的自由爲重，而在他方面，對於政府則純粹以在野之身冷靜觀察，熟烈信任與支持，這正是民主國家在野的政治家的心境和風度，除此以外，任何揣測，都是錯誤的和不必要的了。</p>
<p>蔣先生今日的地位，更是顯明，他的總統職權已依中華民國憲法的規定，交由李副總統代行，但是，他是中國國民黨的總裁，他繼續領導黨中同志，爲國民革命而奮門，爲使太黨今日的地位易於瞭解起見，最好以英國工黨今日的地位爲比喻，今日工黨在英國國會中，爲多數黨，而艾德禮且以多數黨領袖組閣，但是工黨的指導者拉斯某教授，則並不參加國會，也不參加內閣，本黨今臼亦復如此，本黨在國民大會與立法院中爲多數黨李副總統以本黨同志而代行總統職權，孫院長以太黨同志而組閣，本黨的黨務則由蔣總裁指導，只要我們明白了這一點，也就不難理解總裁今日的地位了。</p>
<p>我們在此必須指出，今日本黨的　象，是組織渙散，精神消沉，失敗主義遍在於一般同志之問，當前政治的失敗與軍事的挫折，根本原因皆在於此，如果黨的病象不能救治，則對於現賀的政治，軍事作枝節的應付，決不能坐致民旅的復興。總裁今日能以在野的地位，遠承總理民國二年改組中華革命黨的先例改造本黨，使其重新担當救國建國的責任，這是國民革命根本之岡，希望一般同志團結，在總裁的周圍向這一方向而前進。</p>

<h3>于童兩院長抵滬　分別召集臨立委座談會孫院長血壓高不擬北上</h3>

<h3>軍隊駐校問題</h3>
<p>— 周君尙</p>
<p>遜淸的湘軍開近代中國私有軍隊的起源，但曾國藩擴然大公，金陵克復後，便把湘軍解放。李鴻章所訓練的淮軍就大不相同，他們自關乾坤，即曾國藩也難指揮如意。會要李家兄弟出來幫忙，並對李說：「區區微忱，非强賢昆仲以所難，實見捻非淮勇不能滅，淮勇非君家不能督率。」可見李屬淮軍實構成軍有軍隊的形態。迨後袁世凱以淮軍子弟傳其衣缽，便變成淸末民初的北洋軍閥。軍閥統轄的軍隊，好淫擄掠，無法無天，人人痛心疾首。</p>
<p>中國人民過去對軍隊隔膜，甚且視作虎狼，其原因之一爲過去軍隊私有及軍隊禍國殃民之故。國民革命以還，凡軍隊則號稱國民革命軍，簡稱國軍，軍隊與國家人民開始發生關係，國軍一切的活動是為了國家，一切的犧牲是爲了人民，秉國家的命令，人民的耍求，而衛國保民。八年抗戰，軍隊較一般社會進步，尤較政治更進步。一般社會和政治精神無軍人的緊張，其職務觀念亦遠遜，生活樣式更差得多。軍人能盡拼命的責任，而政府官吏和社會人士不能像軍人那樣爲國家盡其最大的貢獻。</p>
<p>時至今日，眼看少數貪官污吏，豪門奸商，發「國難財」，發「勝利財」，最近又發「應變財」，無處無地不發財，可是廣大民衆吃國難苦，吃勝利苦，又吃應變苦，無處無地不吃苦。而政府對此，是非不明，麻木不仁，於是引起社會上的切齒痛恨，有意無意遷怒到軍隊，實際上，軍人收入（尤其是士兵收入），連自己一個人尙且餓得不死不活，正在怨氣冲天，紀律自不免因之而稍差。</p>
<p>因紀律差而發生的問題自然很多。軍隊駐校是紀律差的一個結果。近前綫各大城市的學校，大多早被駐軍或過境軍隊所佔據。照理，軍隊到一個地方，應向當地主管軍事機關報到，然後，商借適宜的處所居住。如今不依此手續而橫衡直撞的，頗不乏人。他們住佔學校，先派武裝人員接洽，態度好的固多，令人難於容忍的亦所在皆是。學校最先當然據理婉辭，但來勢洶洶，毫不客氣，「秀才碰着兵，有理說不淸」，弄得學校人員有啼無笑。在「你借，也借；不借，也借」的聲勢下，學校變得無主無權。起初，只說借住一二天，後來住個無限期。起初，只晚住一二百人，後來七八百人亦不止。起初，軍隊是客人，後來居然是主人了。校內一切由他們擺佈，有時校長進出也反而要被盤問了，於是學校宛若兵營。</p>
<p>學校駐軍產生了二個嚴重問題：一是反教育，一是反兵役。許多學校因駐紥軍隊，開不成學，上不成課，憑空製造成千成萬的下一代失學。好好安靖的地方，遭此失學災難，豈不有違統帥「教育第一」的意志？反教育之外，而軍人不聽統帥之言，其結局將何如？何况軍隊在校，不免有少數人的舉動對靑年兒童不是一種頂好的榜樣，平時用水，用電，燒飯，排洩，和淸潔諸事，姑不具論，特殊的毛病也未嘗沒有。上海某校學生報告，伙伕留柴，要賣給學生膳食會。又二月八日半夜，上海某校的門房，因半夜三更在半醒中起床，錀匙斷在鎖裹，開門遲延，被打耳光二十餘記，復罰他跪下，口口聲聲要槍斃他。翌日大動公憤，引起學生自治會開會嗚不平，幾乎鬧大事，幸經學校當局勸止，暫告寗息。</p>
<p>不能上課的失學情形，可拿上海做例子。今日上海學校已經至少三十餘校一部或全部爲軍隊所借，每校平均有六百學生不能上學，則達二萬人失學；每人每日脫課六小時，二萬人每天將荒廢學業十二萬小時，一個月就要三百六十萬小時。換句話講，軍隊佔住了三十多學校，停課一個月，便是十五萬天的失學，等於損失四百十六多年的光陰。此僅上海一隅之地，一個月的損失，現狀如再拖延，全國的損失不可勝計。這種掛失，再拿什麼來贖回？</p>
<p>軍隊駐入城市，有百害而無一利。軍隊入市，不能下鄉或退住郊外，是迫不得已的事。城市誘惑多，風俗習尙和一般生活，不及郊外鄉區樸實，且柴米油菜亦昂貴得多。今上海軍隊有住在五馬路的格致中學內，那區燈紅酒綠，妓館林立，尤爲不宜，無怪該校駐軍前次有六人逃走。翌晨追獲逃兵一名，備受責罰，學生校工目睹此景，把這消息傳播四方，決非兵役福音。士兵吃得仍很壞，有的只用鹽水過飯，一無菜食，學生見了也不是好影響。</p>
<p>昔會國藩以綠營腐敗，不堪一擊，乃自練湘軍。他取兵的互質，一個重要的標準是不要游卒滑弁，僅擇「鄕民壯健樸實者。」他致書彭筱房曾香梅書云：無取浮華之輩，而求土作之類」，凡油滑者都予淘汰。今國軍來自鄉間，理宜遠避城市，保存健樸。上海浮華之地，五方雜處，市區駐軍，日久易流油滑衰弱，此帶兵者不能不詳加考慮。報載要「澈底整肅軍風紀，軍憲合組執法隊」，足證兵卒已有問題。但執法隊糾察隊等還是治標，不是治本。治本之計，唯有遠離市區，嚴加訓練。</p>
<p>軍了人訓練應該要「訓」重於「練」。曾國藩與張石卿制軍書說：「恐民心一去，不可挽回；誓欲練成一旅，秋毫無犯，以挽民心而塞民口。每逢三八操演，集諸勇而教之，反復開說至千百語，但令其無擾百姓，……稍變武弁漫無紀律之態。」如此「苦口滴杜鵑之血」的訓練，慢慢就成爲有信仰的軍隊了。記得第二次大戰太平洋事變時，香港英國軍隊駐入戯院等公共塲所，桌椅的損壞，水電的耗費，事後派兵查明，掃數賠償。這種的合理措施，影響軍隊的訓練與民心的歸順，收效實在太大了。</p>
<p>軍隊退出市區，撤離學校，有利於兵役，有益於教育，此理至明。再不然，我們體念軍隊目前的處境，不能不借住若干學校，但駐在學校裹，頂起碼的要求無礙上課，不住敎主觀。臥走廊，守秩序，講淸潔，這豈是不能做到的事？我們以沉重的心情，籲請國軍長官救救兵役，救救教育，饒了學校，饒了下一代。</p>

<p>按美國基於戰時對英協定，享有租用紐芬蘭三戰略空軍基地九十九年的權利，紐芬闌在本年五月卅一日卽將成爲加拿大一省，加拿大承認美國租用上述基地的權利，但希望基於美加在一九四七年簽訂的，防衛協定，將此等基地置於美加共同管理之下。美加官員並預測，商務問題及計劃中之北大西洋公約，均將提出討論。洛倫特本人早已爲該公約的熱烈主張者。杜魯門與艾契遜或將公約談判進展情形，包括最近與挪外長問琪商談的結果，告知洛倫特。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕挪威外長蘭琪與美政府討論北大西洋盟約，現已告一段落，闌氏定今夜飛往倫敦將於訪問英外相後啓程返國。行前渠與美國務卿艾契遜晤談入十分鐘，發表聯合公報稱，「挪外長此次來美，覓取有關北大西洋公約情形，會與美國務卿坦白詳細討論此項盟約之目標與性質，並就挪威安全問題提供意見，各方面均經審慎考慮，但未有何決定。</p>
<h3>犬養前後民主黨決參加新閣</h3>

<p>〔新亞社東京十二日電〕吉田新閣將於三四日內組成，故新首相之親任式將與新閣僚之任命式，同時在日皇宮中舉行。關於民主黨問題，不論該黨是否發生內部分裂之事實，犬養派已決定與吉田合作，完成保守聯合政府，將來犬養派民主黨人士，可能二三人入閣。</p>
<p>〔又電〕日本第三次吉田內閣之組閣工作現巳開始，十二日晨吉田會召大野與廣川會商。據悉廣川業巳擬就新閣閣僚名單，及國會各種委員會主委名單，交與吉田參考。此項名單吉田似已表示可以接受，惟尙須民主黨總裁犬養健將該黨入閣人負名單提出後，始能作最後之決定。聞廣川所提之名單中，計有大矢省三（大藏），益谷秀次（法務），林讓治（厚生），森幸太郞（農林）或周東英雄連任。增田甲子七（勞動連任），靑木孝義（安本），小澤佐重喜（官房長官）。此項名單中尙留有商工，運輸，遞信，建設及國務相若干空位，以便從參議院或民主黨方面銓衡，依廣川之建議，新內閣外相一職，仍由首相兼任，以便首相獲得更多與麥帥總部方面直接接觸之</p>
<h3>南外次致函四強會議　未提對奧賠償要求　南轉向美國示助頗為微妙</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十二日廣播：南斯拉夫外次貝勃勒，今日致函四外次會議，函中並未提起賠償要求，此間認爲頗可注意。因以前奧和約談判，皆以南國堅持賠償一億五千萬美元及疆界爭執而致破裂也。貝氏函中透露，渠會先與美代表李培爾商談。南代表不向蘇聯求助而首次先與美國商洽，此間極加重視。</p>

<h3>調停息爭之任人民義不容辭　徐寄廎開幕詞提出三點意見</h3>
<p>茲錄徐寄廎，倪弼，郭維屏，王曉簌等致詞如下：徐寄廎致開幕詞稱：今天是全國和平促進會開幕的一天，記得在一個月以前，潘議長與本人發起邀請全國各省市參議會正副議長或負責代表，各全國性職業團體理事畏或常務理事，全國性婦女團體代表，命駕來滬，鄭重召開一次站在人民立塲的全國和平促進會議，以期共同商討如何促成和平的方案，當時吾人以爲弭戰罷兵乃全國人民所一致蔪求，上海爲吾國自辛亥革命以還，數次和平統一會議之地點，成功史實，記憶猶新，而交通便利，中外注目，尤利於和平運動之進行，所以敢於發起邀請在上海開會，幸承各地代表，不辭跋涉，遠道來滬參加，對於各位的熱忱，本人代表上海市參議會同人，表示萬分感謝。</p>
<p>自從本會議發起，到現在一個月的期間，政府當局，巳經逐步採取種種謀取和平的措施，蔣總統爲順應民意，發佈兀旦文告，倡導和平，復於一月二十一日，身先引退，以期消弭戰禍於萬一。及至李代總統執政以後，更積極派遣和平談判的代表，與中共接治開談的時間與地點，最近且准許南京方面邱致中等諸先生上海方面顏駿人等諸先生以私人資格飛平與中共當局商討關於和平的問題，凡此種種，都足以證明政府謀取和平的誠意，巳經爲天下人所共見。至於中共方面，我們在中共負責當局歷次的廣播中聽到，也極願意以和平談判的方式來解決爭端，所成爲問題的祗是所謂「準備尚未就緒」而已。原則上，無一論是政府當局，或者是中共當局，如果大家眞爲人民着想，則和平解決爭端應該都沒有問題，所以對於和平的前途，我們應該可以樂觀。然而現在所以尚不能順利進行和平談判的關鍵，究竟在那裏呢？和平統一，實爲人人心理之所同，天視民視，天聽民聽，民之好惡，已經顯而易見了。我們老百姓沒有一個人不希望和平之早日實現，而政府與中共也沒有說不要和平，和平爲什麼還不能馬上實現？以我們人民的立塲言，我們需要的是那一種形式的和平？兄弟覺得，我們人民都有批評與主張的權利，只要我們人民自己不放棄我們自己的權利，任何不能遠反全國人民一致的意志的。</p>
<p>其次，假若政府與中共雙方之和談果能開始了，一切辦法，中途或未必全無爭議，則調停息爭之任，我們各地民意代表，職業代表，都可以代表人民的需要，來作抉擇。所以和平既是人民生命存亡所關鍵，則調停息爭之任，我們人民要亦義不容辭。</p>
<p>旣要談和不必再打</p>
<p>再就我們老百姓的生活來講，國家爲抵抗日本帝國主義的侵略，先後抗戰八年，再繼之以三年來的內戰，所犧牲的無非是老百姓的生命與財產，國家的元氣，現在已經到了生靈塗炭，民無噍類，國家陷於萬劫不復之地步，如果戰爭再不停止，恐怕中華民族眞有滅亡的危機。因此我們感覺到，我們不但要喊「和平」，差不多要喊「救命」了。因爲要救命，所以我們同時主張，既然好歹都要坐在會議桌上來談，現在　不必再打，也不　再打，換言之，雙方在各戰綫上應該立卽就總停戰。惟有立卽停戰，始能表示雙方對和平的誠意。兄弟承本會籌備會之推派，担任本次大會開幕時的臨時主席，自感德薄能鮮，愧難勝任，惟深覺促進和平，人人都有責任，所以貿然担任下來了。幸在本次大會還要另推主席團，希望各地碩彥，各界領袖，能夠在這個具有歷史性的難得的聚會，多多發表高見，暢所欲言。本次大會果能有所成就，不但是同人之幸，而且是全國同胞之幸，中華民族之幸。上述三點個人之淺見，僅能提供各位作爲參考，尚祈各位指教。</p>
<p>徐副議長致詞（本報攝）</p>
<p>監委對和談意見</p>
<p>來賓監察委員倪弼致詞略稱：這次大會意義在於促進和平，是全國人民所共同蔪求者，因爲不和平，人民就活不下去了。聽說米價已達萬兀一石，這樣，人民一面須受織事威脅，一面又須受生活壓迫，如何生存？我們監委對求和的意見是：（一）要有勇氣承認失敗；（二）要妥商條件，（三）要排除陣碍；（四）要整飭綱紀。</p>
<p>甘肅人民主張八點</p>
<p>甘肅省參議會副議長郭維屏致詞：西北地瘠民貧，種族複雜，環境特殊，大家都很關心，幸自張文白先生到後，以和平，民主，統一，團結政策相號召，頗得各方擁廳，目前正在保境安民，爭取全面和平，此場告慰各位者。至甘肅人民對和平之意見有下列八點，提供各位參考：（一）和平應以平等亙諒爲基礎。（二）雙方卽行停戰。（三）召開全國各黨派各法團各區域代表及社會賢達的政協會議。（四）維持中華民國法統，並可依法修改憲法。（五）依據民生主義，實行節制資本平均地權政策。（六）保障人民生活自由。（七）軍隊屬於國家，任何黨派不得以武力當工具。（八）和談一切應在中央政府領導下作全國』致行動。</p>
<h3>王曉籟有兩感想三個信念</h3>
<p>商聯會王曉籟致詞：今天全國和平促進會商討全國人民矚望最股之和平問題，曉籟有兩種感想，三種信念。所謂兩種感想者，一則以喜，一則以懼：（一）所喜者何？雙方磋商條件雖尚有相當距離，但全國人民需要和平，爭取和平，已爲雙方當局所公認。在我國人民立塲，實深切希望民國三十八年能成爲眞正和平之年。果其如是，則雙方釋嫌修好，止戈爲武，自爲現代中國新政治史上各決政治爭端之民主正軌，亦可從此奠定基礎，建立模範。（二）所懼者何？最近道路喧傳，雙方對於和談之進行，尚無積極之準備，而對於戰事之部署，攻守雙方，調度仍復頻繁，甚且有預測第三次世界大戰將以我國爲導火綫者。心所謂危，不寒而慓。以上兩種情緒，諒亦本會出席諸君所同感。今日會議最重要之課題，殆卽爲如何使吾人所希望者早日實現，而使吾人所危懼者早日消弭，易言之卽善人對於和平前途之信念與意加努力之途徑是已，下茲和平閃爍國　絕續之嚴重契　，深盼雙方當局，本互忍互讓之赤忱，抱惟公惟允之熊度，捐除小我，顧全大局，戮力同心，共圖挽救。吾人對於和平前途之基本信條，則不外三端：（一）尊崇民族固有道德，發揚民族固有精神，不出主，亦不入奴。　　東西社會思潮，按切國內現實環境，以謀政治上經濟上有計劃有步驟之澈底的改革與進步。（二）保持絕對超然立塲，努力排難解紛工作，無所倚，亦無所偏。集思廣益兼顧雙方所提條件，以爲雙方和談之初步基礎，進而協定有關政治經濟軍事諸方面之新改革方案，並以全民意旨決其可否，全民力魚促其實現，（三）認淸國家當前危據三把　民心向背關鍵，不拖延，亦不過激。推誡商權，當機之斷。一切皆以人民意旨爲意旨，以人民福利爲福利，以期建立眞正民有民治民亭之新中國。</p>

<h3>Acting President Li to Broadcast Tomorrow Evening: Reaffirming Resolve for Peace Talks</h3>
<h3>With Communists, Yan Huiqing and Shao Lizi Fly to Beiping This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Nanjing Broadcast from San Francisco, 12th: Acting President Li will deliver an important broadcast tomorrow evening, reaffirming the government's determination to seek peace with the Communist Party. It is expected that Acting President Li's broadcast speech will strongly reaffirm the government's unwavering determination to achieve peace. This statement will clarify the misunderstanding regarding recent reports from Guangdong that the government intends to continue fighting. These reports claimed that Acting President Li had agreed to Sun Ke's war policy. Acting President Li's broadcast is expected to emphasize that the government's primary goal remains peace.</p>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Gan Jiehou received a long-distance call from Beiping yesterday afternoon, requesting the peace delegation to fly to Beiping today. Gan informed Yan Huiqing yesterday evening at 6 p.m. to notify all delegation members to prepare for departure. This morning, the representatives gathered at Yan's residence at 9 a.m., as previously arranged, to wait for the plane to Beiping. Shao Lizi is traveling on the same flight. They will exchange views with key figures of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding Zhang Zhizhong's resignation as a peace talk representative, the Presidential Palace had not yet received a report as of the 12th. According to political figures, Zhang's resignation was likely submitted to the Executive Yuan, as the peace talk representatives were appointed by the Executive Yuan. The reason for Zhang's resignation is unknown. It is reported that Zhang has claimed illness while in Lanzhou. It has been observed that the Chinese Communist Party has recently launched many attacks on the peace talk representatives, including Zhang. At a time when the future of peace is still difficult to predict, the criticism of the peace talk representatives may be the main reason for Zhang's resignation.</p>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent, Nanjing, 12th] The assurance given here today by Ye Jianying of the Chinese Communist Party to the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, promising that the Communist Party would agree to hold peace talks within this month and would not attack Nanjing, Shanghai, or areas along the Yangtze River before the final outcome of the peace talks is decided, shows that the nationwide people's eager call for peace has made it impossible for the Communist Party to ignore national public opinion. However, it is generally believed that excessive optimism about the future of peace is not warranted until the Communist army officially orders a ceasefire. According to various indications, the Communist army north of the Yangtze River is actively preparing for replenishment. However, Ye Jianying's statement that they will not attack Nanjing, Shanghai, and areas along the Yangtze River within a month should be considered credible. This morning, Qiu Zhizhong of the People's Peace Delegation met with Acting President Li to report on the discussions with the Chinese Communist Party in Beiping. Qiu verbally conveyed the views of the Chinese Communist Party brought back by the delegation during the meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] According to sources, General Ye Jianying has assured the Nanjing Professor Peace Delegation that the Communist Party will agree to hold peace talks within this month and will not attack Shanghai, Nanjing and areas along the Yangtze River before the final outcome is decided. The message stated that Ye asked the delegation to convey "several necessary conditions" to Nanjing for starting peace talks. However, the nature of the "necessary conditions" was not disclosed, but it was stated that they included a demand to stop war preparations. The delegation also gained the following impressions in Beiping: (1) The Communist Party believes that Li Zongren is not strong enough to represent the Kuomintang in the negotiation of a peace agreement and will cause internal divisions within the government. (2) The Communist Party is willing to make certain modifications to the demand to "punish war criminals." (3) The Communist Party will not demand the detention or trial of President Chiang. (4) The Communist Party will remove harsh conditions regarding the reorganization of government troops. Wu Yu later quoted Ye Jianying as saying, "If the Kuomintang sincerely seeks peace, the Chinese Communist Party is willing to make peace happen as soon as possible." Wu also revealed that Ye Jianying and other Communist leaders have handed over detailed peace conditions to the delegation to be conveyed to the government. Wu said that the delegation will publish a full report "at an appropriate time."</p>
<h3>Dai Chuanxian Passes Away in Guangzhou Due to Excessive Sleeping Pills</h3>
<h3>Central Standing Committee Discusses Funeral Arrangements Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent, Guangzhou, 12th] Dai Chuanxian, a senior member of the Party and the State, passed away suddenly at 8 a.m. on the 12th at Dongshan Dongyuan in Guangzhou. It was found that he had been suffering from heart disease and needed to take sleeping pills every night to fall asleep, as had been the case since coming to Guangzhou. Last night, he may have taken too many sleeping pills, which affected his heart. After the discovery this morning, the director of the Medical College of Zhongshan University first attempted to rescue him, followed by the director of the Municipal Health Bureau, Zhu Guangtao, but it was too late. The Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang held a meeting at 4 p.m. to discuss funeral arrangements. On the day before his death, he had expressed his intention to enter Sichuan. His sudden passing has shocked those who heard the news.</p>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent, Nanjing, 12th] It has been learned here that Dai Chuanxian, the former President of the Examination Yuan, and his wife took sleeping pills together and fell asleep the night before his death. Dai did not wake up at 8 a.m. on the 12th, and his wife is still receiving treatment in the hospital.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, learned of the critical condition of Dai Chuanxian, a senior member of the Party and the State, before leaving Guangzhou on the 12th. They made a special visit to his bedside as he was dying, lingered for a long time, and sadly said goodbye. Yu could not help but shed tears, feeling infinite grief in his heart.</p>
<p>A Brief Biography of Dai</p>
<p>Dai Chuanxian, also known as Jitao, was from Wuxing, Zhejiang, and was born in Guanghan County, Sichuan. At the age of fifteen, he went to Japan to study. Three years before the founding of the Republic of China, he graduated from Nihon University. After returning to China, he served as an instructor at the Jiangsu Local Self-Government Research Institute for one year. During the Gengxu and Xinhai years (1910-1911), he served as the chief writer for the Shanghai Zhongwai Daily, Tianduo Bao, and the Penang Guanghua Bao, advocating revolutionary ideas. While in Penang, he joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance). When the Wuhan Revolution broke out, he returned to China and devoted himself to the revolutionary movement in the Northeast. In the first year of the Republic of China, he served as the chief writer for the Minquan Bao. At that time, Sun Yat-sen presided over the national railway affairs and appointed him as his secretary. The following spring, he accompanied Sun to Japan. In the winter of that year, the campaign against Yuan Shikai failed, and he went to the Northeast to plot revolution. Failing again, he went to Japan to help Sun Yat-sen organize the Chinese Revolutionary Party, serving as the branch leader in Zhejiang and the chief writer for the Minguo Zazhi (Republic Magazine). In the fifth year, he returned to China with Sun Yat-sen. In the sixth year, he served as the Secretary-General of the Grand Marshal's Office and the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the eighth year, he founded the Shanghai Weekly Review and assisted Sun Yat-sen in presiding over the Construction Magazine with Hu Zhantang, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and others. In the eleventh year, he returned to Sichuan under the order of the Premier to persuade the various armies to cease fighting and develop industries. In the twelfth year, after the establishment of the General Headquarters, he was appointed concurrently as the Chairman of the Legislative Committee by the Grand Marshal. In the thirteenth year, the Kuomintang was reorganized, and he was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee, the Minister of Propaganda, and a member of the Central Political Committee at the First National Congress. In the fourteenth year, the National Government was established, and he served as a member of the National Government Committee. In the fifteenth year, he served as the Chairman of Zhongshan University. In the spring of the sixteenth year, he was sent to Japan as an envoy. After returning to China, he was reassigned as the President of Zhongshan University, and also served as a member of the Propaganda Department, a member of the Central Political Conference, and the Director of the Political Training Department of the General Headquarters. In the seventeenth year, he was elected as a member of the National Government Committee and the President of the Examination Yuan, until the Constitution was promulgated in the thirty-seventh year, when he resigned after the establishment of the Presidential Office. In the eighteenth year, he also served as the Minister of Training. In the twentieth year, the Central Organization established a special foreign affairs committee, and he served as the chairman. At the Fourth National Congress, he was re-elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee and a member of the Political Conference. In June of the thirty-seventh year, he succeeded Zhang Ji as the Director of the National History Museum. His writings were numerous, but many were lost. His most famous works include "The Philosophical Foundations of the Three Principles of the People," "The Road of Youth," "The National Revolution and the Chinese Kuomintang," and "On Japan," which were loved by young people. His son, Anguo, studied electrical engineering in Belgium and is currently the Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>Trygve Lie Says He Doesn't Object to UN Mediation in Chinese War</h3>
<h3>Australian Foreign Minister Considers Formally Proposing Suggestion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] It is learned that Australian Foreign Minister and President of the United Nations General Assembly, Evatt, is considering suggesting that the United Nations mediate to resolve the Chinese civil war. According to reports, Evatt has not yet made a final decision on this matter. Sources from the Australian delegation here said that they have not received instructions from Evatt requesting United Nations mediation, but that Evatt discussed the possibility of United Nations mediation in the China issue with United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie earlier this month via long-distance telephone. Lie and Evatt cooperated at the end of last year to try to resolve the Greek civil war and the Berlin crisis. However, this time Lie was noncommittal about Evatt's suggestion, but Lie hinted that he did not object to Evatt requesting United Nations mediation in his capacity as Australian Foreign Minister. According to reports, Evatt will take office as President when the General Assembly opens on April 5. Australian sources claim that Evatt believes that "if China's long and tragic war harms the entire country and delays reconstruction and recovery, this is a right that the suffering people of China should enjoy. If we strictly adhere to the principles of the United Nations and assist in mediation to promote an agreed peace, it will save countless lives." If Evatt makes this suggestion, he seems likely to request mediation under Article 14 of the United Nations Charter, which states that the General Assembly may recommend peaceful adjustment measures for any situation.</p>
<h3>"President Chiang's State of Mind" - Editorial in Nanjing Central Daily Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Nanjing Central Daily's editorial on the 12th, titled "President Chiang's State of Mind," reads in full as follows:</p>
<p>A dispatch from Xikou says that President Chiang returned to his hometown for the New Year. During this early spring, he walked from Xikou to Fenghua County and visited Tiantong Temple, paying homage to the Cold Fragrance Pagoda of his former monastic friend, Ruzhi Toutuo. As President Chiang walked, he received the respect and cheers of the residents of the villages and towns. President Chiang's mood was pleasant and serene, unlike anything he had experienced in thirty years.</p>
<p>Since President Chiang left Nanjing on January 21, comrades in the Party have often wondered about President Chiang's future plans. We believe that to answer this question, we must first understand President Chiang's outlook on life, and second, we must understand President Chiang's current position. If we have a correct understanding of these two points, we will not make incorrect and unnecessary speculations about President Chiang's actions.</p>
<p>President Chiang has always been consistent in his conduct and actions, always starting from a sense of duty and responsibility. In his early years, he followed Premier Sun, regardless of position, seeking no fame, only seeking to do his best for the revolution. In 1924, Premier Sun founded the Whampoa Military Academy and appointed Chiang as its president. Despite severe difficulties in funding and ammunition, he cultivated the backbone of the National Revolutionary Army, completed the unification of Guangdong, and launched the Northern Expedition. Before the split between Nanjing and Wuhan, Chiang did not dwell on his achievements and withdrew to promote the unity of the Party. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, whenever there were disturbances, even if he had to use force, the result was always a peaceful resolution due to Chiang's tolerance and concession. After the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), Chiang resigned for the second time to awaken national unity against foreign aggression. After the victory over the Communists in Jiangxi, he promoted their joint efforts to resist foreign aggression through peaceful, political methods. When the War of Resistance against Japan initially ended, the prestige of the National Government was unprecedented in history, and President Chiang, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Government, sent a telegram to the Chinese Communist Party, inviting Mao Zedong to Chongqing to discuss the great plan of peaceful nation-building. This was followed by the Political Consultative Conference, where he first proposed a plan to reorganize the National Government and end the period of political tutelage, fully demonstrating the spirit of forbearance for the sake of the country. After the Chinese Communist Party destroyed the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the military reorganization plan, they launched a full-scale rebellion, creating a dangerous situation of military disaster. President Chiang then issued a statement on New Year's Day this year, reiterating the policy of peaceful resolution, and resigned for the third time to facilitate the start of peace talks. Looking back on President Chiang's fifty years of revolutionary experiences, especially his major decisions on advancement and withdrawal, it proves that everything he did was based on a sense of duty and responsibility. As long as we have a correct understanding of this, it is not difficult to know that President Chiang, on the one hand, values the independence of the country and the freedom of the people, and on the other hand, purely observes, calmly trusts, and supports the government from an unofficial position. This is exactly the mindset and demeanor of a politician in the opposition in a democratic country. Any speculation beyond this is wrong and unnecessary.</p>
<p>President Chiang's current position is even clearer. His presidential powers have been handed over to Vice President Li in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of China. However, he is the Director-General of the Chinese Kuomintang. He continues to lead the comrades in the Party to strive for the National Revolution. To make the Party's current position easier to understand, it is best to compare it to the current position of the British Labour Party. Today, the Labour Party is the majority party in the British Parliament, and Attlee has formed a cabinet as the leader of the majority party. However, Professor Laski, the leader of the Labour Party, does not participate in Parliament or the cabinet. Our Party is the same today. Our Party is the majority party in the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan. Vice President Li, as a comrade of our Party, is acting as President, and President Sun, as a comrade of our Party, is forming a cabinet. The Party affairs of our Party are guided by President Chiang. As long as we understand this point, it will not be difficult to understand President Chiang's current position.</p>
<p>We must point out here that the current problem of our Party is organizational disarray, spiritual depression, and defeatism prevailing among general comrades. The fundamental cause of the current political failures and military setbacks lies in this. If the Party's illness cannot be cured, then dealing with the current political and military problems in a piecemeal manner will never lead to the revival of the nation. President Chiang is now able to transform our Party from an unofficial position, following the precedent of Premier Sun's reorganization of the Chinese Revolutionary Party in 1913, so that it can once again assume the responsibility of saving and building the country. This is the fundamental principle of the National Revolution. We hope that all comrades will unite and move forward in this direction around President Chiang.</p>

<h3>Presidents of Yu and Tong Arrive in Shanghai,</h3>
<h3>Each Convenes Provisional Legislative Committee Seminar, President Sun's High Blood Pressure Prevents Him from Going North</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by special plane from Guangzhou at 3 p.m. yesterday. President Yu is scheduled to convene a meeting of the Shanghai-based supervisors of the Control Yuan at the Control Yuan's Shanghai office today to discuss the issue of the Control Yuan's relocation to the south. After the meeting, President Yu will travel to Nanjing. After arriving in Shanghai, President Tong attended an informal discussion held by local legislators and reported that the transportation, accommodation, and food issues for legislators in Guangzhou had been largely arranged and that they hoped that legislators in Nanjing and Shanghai would travel south as soon as possible. In order to gather opinions from all sides, President Tong has scheduled a seminar with all Shanghai-based legislators on the 15th of this month at the Shanghai-based legislator's office to discuss everything in detail. It is reported that most of the legislators in Shanghai have no preconceived notions about the relocation of the Legislative Yuan to the south and are willing to consider the current needs of the country, strive to enhance unity, and overcome difficulties together. President Tong also revealed that Wu Tiecheng will come to Shanghai in the next few days. Sun Ke, however, will not come because of his high blood pressure of 224 degrees, which prevents him from enduring long-distance flights. However, Sun and Acting President Li are both loyal to the country and have no grudges against each other. All rumors are speculative.</p>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent, Guangzhou, 11th] Legislators from various places are now arriving in Guangzhou one after another. It is reported that a batch of more than ten legislators has taken the Guangdong-Hankou Railway from Changsha to Guangzhou. More than forty legislators staying in Zhuzhou have also telegraphed the Legislative Yuan here, requesting assistance in traveling south. A batch of more than one hundred staff members of the Legislative Yuan will also arrive in Guangzhou on the 12th.</p>

<h3>Sudden Chaos in Qingdao City, Although the Periphery is Calm, People are Quite Tense, Financial Situation is Barely Maintaining, Lack of Capital</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent, Qingdao, 12th] Although the periphery of Qingdao is calm, the city has been quite chaotic for several days. Gunshots are heard everywhere at night, and robberies occur frequently. Small and large institutions only have empty signs hanging, and most of the heads of the institutions have left Qingdao or are preparing to leave Qingdao. Those who remain in Qingdao also have no official business to handle. The financial industry is barely maintaining the situation, but there is a lack of capital, and business is sluggish. Major construction projects are underway outside the pier, and materials and luggage are piled up like mountains on the pier. The Pacification Zone Headquarters requisitioned the Jingxing and Haisu ships for official use, and the second batch of dependents sailed to Xiamen on the 12th. The citizens of Qingdao have been plunged into a battlefield of nerves. They were previously concerned about whether the U.S. military would withdraw, and now they are asking whether the National Army will withdraw. Flour has fallen to 1,500 yuan a bag, less than two U.S. dollars, and no one wants it. Movie theaters are still open as usual, showing five screenings a day, and are packed with people. Auction houses, which were once very popular, are now also experiencing sluggish transactions. This morning, the National Army on the periphery test-fired cannons, which startled the citizens. The general public sentiment is "both nervous and numb."</p>

Also, the Hefei Garrison Commander is Cao Shengde, and there are currently about 30,000 Communist troops stationed there. A portion of them has gone south along the Gongsheng Highway through Shucheng. However, Tongcheng, which shields Anqing, was once invaded by local Communists on the 8th of this month, but has been officially recovered by the National Army since the 10th. Therefore, the situation in Anqing is now gradually stabilizing.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Troops Stationing in Schools</h3>
<p>— Zhou Junshang</p>
<p>The Xiang Army of the late Qing Dynasty marked the beginning of private armies in modern China, but Zeng Guofan, with great magnanimity, disbanded the Xiang Army after the recapture of Nanjing. The Huai Army trained by Li Hongzhang was quite different. They considered themselves masters of their own fate, and even Zeng Guofan found it difficult to command them as he wished. It took the help of the Li brothers, and he told Li: "My humble request is not to force you and your brother to do something difficult, but it is because I see that the Nian rebels cannot be eliminated without the Huai braves, and the Huai braves cannot be led without your family." This shows that the Huai Army under Li's command had essentially formed a private army. Later, Yuan Shikai passed on his mantle to the descendants of the Huai Army, which turned into the Northern Warlords of the late Qing and early Republican era. The armies controlled by the warlords were lecherous, plundering, and lawless, causing universal grief and indignation.</p>
<p>In the past, the Chinese people were alienated from the military, even regarding them as tigers and wolves, partly because the armies were privately owned and brought disaster to the country. Since the National Revolution, all armies have been called the National Revolutionary Army, or the National Army for short. The army began to have a relationship with the country and its people. All activities of the National Army were for the sake of the country, and all sacrifices were for the sake of the people, following the orders of the country and the demands of the people to defend the country and protect the people. During the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, the army was more progressive than society in general, and even more progressive than politics. The general society and political circles lacked the sense of urgency of the military, their sense of duty was far inferior, and their lifestyle was even worse. Soldiers could fulfill their duty to risk their lives, while government officials and social figures could not contribute to the country as much as the soldiers.</p>
<p>Today, we see a handful of corrupt officials, powerful families, and treacherous merchants making "national crisis fortunes," "victory fortunes," and recently "contingency fortunes," making money everywhere. However, the vast majority of the people suffer the hardships of national crisis, the hardships of victory, and the hardships of contingencies, suffering everywhere. The government is unclear about right and wrong and indifferent to this situation, which has aroused resentment in society, intentionally or unintentionally directed towards the military. In reality, the income of soldiers (especially the income of enlisted soldiers) is so low that they are barely surviving, filled with resentment, and discipline is inevitably somewhat lacking as a result.</p>
<p>Many problems naturally arise from poor discipline. The stationing of troops in schools is one consequence of poor discipline. Schools in major cities near the front lines have mostly been occupied by stationed troops or troops passing through. In theory, when troops arrive in a place, they should report to the local military authorities and then negotiate to borrow suitable premises for accommodation. Nowadays, there are quite a few people who do not follow this procedure and barge in recklessly. When they occupy schools, they first send armed personnel to negotiate. While many have a good attitude, there are also those whose behavior is intolerable. The schools, of course, initially refuse politely with reason, but the momentum is fierce and impolite. As the saying goes, "A scholar cannot reason with a soldier," leaving school personnel with nothing but tears. Under the pressure of "You must lend, whether you want to or not," schools become ownerless and powerless. At first, they only said they would borrow it for a day or two, but later they stayed indefinitely. At first, only one or two hundred people would stay, but later it was more than seven or eight hundred. At first, the troops were guests, but later they became the masters. Everything within the school is at their disposal. Sometimes even the principal is questioned when entering or leaving, and the school becomes like a military camp.</p>
<p>The stationing of troops in schools has created two serious problems: one is anti-education and the other is anti-military service. Many schools have been unable to open or hold classes due to the stationing of troops, creating tens of thousands of out-of-school children for the next generation out of thin air. In a peaceful place, is it not contrary to the commander's will of "education first" to suffer such a disaster of being out of school? In addition to being anti-education, what will be the end result if the military does not listen to the commander? Moreover, it is inevitable that the actions of a few soldiers in the school are not a good example for young children. Not to mention the usual matters of water use, electricity use, cooking, excretion, and cleaning, there are also special problems. A student from a school in Shanghai reported that the cook was keeping firewood to sell to the student cafeteria. Also, on February 8th, in the middle of the night, the doorman of a school in Shanghai was slapped more than twenty times and forced to kneel down because he got up half-awake in the middle of the night and broke the key in the lock, delaying the opening of the door. The next day, public outrage was aroused, and the student union held a meeting to voice their grievances, almost causing a major incident. Fortunately, the school authorities persuaded them to stop, and it was temporarily calmed down.</p>
<p>The situation of being unable to attend classes can be exemplified by Shanghai. Today, at least thirty schools in Shanghai have been partially or completely borrowed by the military. With an average of six hundred students unable to attend school in each school, this means that 20,000 people are out of school. With each person missing six hours of class per day, 20,000 people will waste 120,000 hours of study every day, which amounts to 3.6 million hours per month. In other words, if the military occupies more than thirty schools and suspends classes for a month, it is equivalent to 150,000 days of being out of school, which is equivalent to a loss of more than 416 years of time. This is only the loss in one corner of Shanghai in one month. If the current situation continues to drag on, the losses nationwide will be incalculable. What can be used to redeem this kind of loss?</p>
<p>It is harmful and not beneficial to have troops stationed in the city. It is a last resort for troops to enter the city if they cannot go to the countryside or retreat to the suburbs. Cities have more temptations, customs and general life are not as simple as in the suburbs and rural areas, and firewood, rice, oil, and vegetables are also much more expensive. Now, there are troops in Shanghai stationed in Gezhi Middle School on Wuma Road, which is a red-light district with many brothels, which is especially unsuitable. No wonder six soldiers ran away from the school last time. The next morning, one of the deserters was caught and severely punished. Students and school staff witnessed this scene and spread the news everywhere, which is definitely not good news for military service. The soldiers' food is still very bad, some only eat rice with salt water, without any vegetables. This is not a good influence on the students either.</p>
<p>In the past, Zeng Guofan believed that the Green Standard Army was corrupt and vulnerable, so he trained the Xiang Army himself. One important criterion for recruiting soldiers was that they should not be wandering rogues, but only "strong, honest, and simple villagers." He wrote to Peng Xiaofang and Zeng Xiangmei: "Do not recruit frivolous people, but seek those of the soil," and all slippery people were eliminated. Today, the National Army comes from the countryside and should stay away from cities to preserve their integrity. Shanghai is a frivolous place, with people from all over. If troops are stationed in the urban area for a long time, they will easily become slippery and weak. This is something that those who lead troops must consider carefully. Reports say that "military discipline should be thoroughly rectified, and military police and the constitution should jointly form a law enforcement team," which is enough to prove that there are already problems with the soldiers. However, law enforcement teams and disciplinary teams are still temporary solutions, not fundamental ones. The fundamental solution is to stay away from urban areas and conduct strict training.</p>
<p>Military training should emphasize "instruction" over "practice." Zeng Guofan said in a letter to Admiral Zhang Shiqing: "I am afraid that once the people's hearts are gone, they cannot be recovered. I vow to train a brigade that will not commit the slightest offense, in order to restore the people's hearts and silence their mouths. Every time there is a drill on the 3rd and 8th, I gather the braves and teach them, repeating it thousands of times, only to ensure that they do not disturb the people... so that they can gradually change the undisciplined state of military officers." Such training, with the "bitter heart and dripping blood of the cuckoo," will slowly turn into an army with faith. I remember during the Pacific War in World War II, when British troops in Hong Kong were stationed in theaters and other public places, the damage to tables and chairs and the consumption of water and electricity were investigated and compensated in full. This kind of reasonable measure had a great impact on the training of the army and the allegiance of the people.</p>
<p>Troops withdrawing from urban areas and leaving schools is beneficial to military service and education. This is self-evident. Otherwise, we sympathize with the current situation of the military and cannot but borrow some schools, but the minimum requirement for staying in schools is that it does not hinder classes and does not live in the classrooms. Sleeping in corridors, maintaining order, and paying attention to cleanliness, are these not things that can be done? With a heavy heart, we appeal to the officers of the National Army to save military service, save education, spare the schools, and spare the next generation.</p>

<h3>Not to Incite Anti-American Movement; Academic and Labor Circles Demand Expulsion of Two American Journalists</h3>
<p>[United Press Peiping 12th dispatch] The anti-American movement in Peiping is gradually gaining momentum. This movement was triggered by the Communist Party's news agency asking the people of Peiping to respond to the "insult" of United Press reporter Musa and Associated Press reporter Lyons. It is claimed that Musa said: "Peiping welcomes the Communist army in the same way it welcomed the Japanese army, the American army, and the Kuomintang in the past." In fact, Musa did not make this report. Lyons said: "The people of Peiping welcome the Communist army with reservations." Radio stations have also joined the attack, publishing talks by people from all walks of life published in the Communist mouthpiece "People's Daily," mostly demanding the expulsion of the two journalists, while some believe that an apology would suffice. It also called the United Press and Associated Press tools of American imperialism. The Peking University Student Union denounced Musa and Lyons as small fish working for Wall Street tycoons, warned them that they would suffer the consequences, and demanded that they leave China as soon as possible. A People's Daily editorial said: "American imperialists dream of conquering the world." The Peking University Student Union issued a joint statement saying: "The two journalists have aroused unprecedented anger among all students in Peiping and will be taught a lesson." The Yenching University Student Union demanded the expulsion of the two journalists. The Normal University declared: "American imperialists are using the two to slander the people of Peiping." Chaoyang University demanded that the two journalists publicly apologize, otherwise they should be expelled immediately. Tsinghua University said: "There are more than one million people who want to tell you their opinions." Shanxi University decided to ask the authorities to expel the two journalists. According to newspaper reports and radio broadcasts, a Communist soldier said that the reports of the two journalists were absolutely false and had no facts. Workers at the power company said that the two journalists had caused great humiliation to the people of Peiping. An electric cable worker said: "Kick them out." A rickshaw puller said: "It is better to drive those two rumor-mongers out of the country." A tricycle driver said: "What they send out is all false news. When Americans come to China, they beat us up once they get drunk." Peiping students are scheduled to hold a rally on the 13th to celebrate the arrival of the Communist army in Peiping, and it is expected that there will be more accusations against American imperialism.</p>

<h3>Luo Er Makes a Statement in Honolulu: The United States Has No Plans to Withdraw Troops from Japan; If War Breaks Out in the Far East, the United States Will Be Sufficient to Handle Any Aggression; The Importance of Alaska is Further Highlighted</h3>
<p>[Honolulu, United Press, 10th] U.S. Secretary of the Army Royall returned home after meeting with MacArthur in Tokyo and inspecting U.S. military defenses in the Pacific. Today, he revealed this matter and declared at a press conference that if war breaks out in the Far East, the United States will be capable of handling any aggressor in Japan. However, he believes that if there is a war in the Far East, it will not involve the United States. When asked if the United States plans to withdraw troops stationed in Japan if it goes to war with the Soviet Union, Royall replied that he was unaware of any plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops in the area. MacArthur and he both believe that the United States will be able to handle any aggression in Japan. MacArthur's achievements in Japan have been remarkable, and the government does not plan to transfer him. Royall also stated that the entire army will be reduced by 25% in June due to budget constraints, in order to economize on military spending. The position of Alaska is extremely important, and he hopes to improve the equipment of the garrison and formulate a reasonable plan to address the future military situation. Okinawa is also an important base, and a large number of U.S. troops should continue to be stationed there.</p>
<p>[Washington, United Press, 11th] A spokesperson for the Department of the Army declared on the 11th: He was instructed to announce that the reports in Tokyo newspapers that the United States would withdraw from Japan without a fight in the event of a conflict with the Soviet Union are completely unfounded. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on reports from senior military strategists.</p>
<p>[Washington, Agence France-Presse, 11th] American military officials generally believe that the plan prepared by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff to deal with possible aggression is based on: (1) preserving Europe and the Near East; (2) using these areas as a springboard for counterattacks. In any new world conflict, Japan will assume the role of a "defensive fortress."</p>
<p>[Tokyo, United Press, 12th] Prime Minister Yoshida today declined to comment on reports that Japan will occupy a secondary position in the U.S. defense plan. He only stated that he does not fear Japan being invaded, nor does he believe that war will break out in Europe. As long as MacArthur is in charge of the occupation, his task is to maintain order and relieve the United States of the burden of Japan's economic reconstruction.</p>
<p>[Our News] London, 12th Radio: The British Foreign Office stated that the British Embassy in Tunisia is currently investigating rumors of a change in U.S. policy toward Japan with the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>[London, United Press, 12th] Former British naval and army commanders in the Far East stated on the 12th that the rumored U.S. plan to withdraw from Japan "is strategically sound." They unanimously believe that U.S. policy should currently focus on ensuring Japan's neutrality, rather than military bases on Japanese territory. This view is shared by Lieutenant General Percival, former commander of British forces in Malaya, and Admiral Layton, former commander of the British Far East Fleet.</p>
<h3>Marshal Eisenhower Takes Office as Truman's Military Advisor to Assist the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Deciding Strategic Issues</h3>
<p>[Washington, United Press, 11th] According to the White House on the 11th, Marshal Eisenhower has been temporarily recalled to advise President Truman and assist the Joint Chiefs of Staff in deciding comprehensive strategic issues. Assistant White House Press Officer Ives stated that this five-star general will serve as the president's and Forrestal's "chief military advisor and consultant." In addition, he will also serve as chairman in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he has already taken office on the 7th.</p>
<p>Ives stated that Eisenhower's service in Washington will be of a relatively temporary nature, and he has taken a leave of absence from Columbia University for seven to eight weeks. White House and Department of Defense officials both deny that Eisenhower was recalled due to the worsening of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. A Department of Defense spokesperson stated that his greatest task will be to "unify the Joint Chiefs of Staff's opinions on basic strategic issues and handle the accumulation of 'routine' official business" related to the three services. It is reported that the Navy and Air Force have extremely divergent views on who will be in charge of strategic bombing. Eisenhower will also resolve disputes between the Navy and Air Force over the allocation of the defense budget.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower's Comeback is Extremely Welcomed in the Philippines</h3>
<p>[Manila, Agence France-Presse, 12th] A spokesperson for the Philippine Presidential Palace stated that President Quirino warmly welcomes Eisenhower's appointment as a U.S. military advisor. The spokesperson stated that Eisenhower's appointment is timely, as the world military situation, especially in the Far East, has undergone significant changes. The spokesperson also reflected the views of Philippine military leaders, stating that they believe Eisenhower will have deep sympathy and understanding for Philippine military issues and status, as he himself served as MacArthur's Chief of Staff in the Philippines before the war from 1935 to 1937.</p>
<h3>Anti-Tito Movement: It is Rumored that the Cominform is Holding a Meeting to Organize a New Balkan Alliance</h3>
<p>[Our News] New York, 12th Radio, Rome News: Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti and Cominform representative Saikia have suddenly disappeared. Political figures speculate that they have attended another International Intelligence Bureau meeting, and some believe the meeting is taking place in Prague. Togliatti has been absent from Congress for three days, but Saikia only began his absence this week.</p>
<p>[London, Agence France-Presse, 11th] The sudden dismissal of Markos, commander-in-chief of the Free Greek forces, has aroused various rumors here. One theory is that this is the first minor sign of a large-scale Comintern intelligence operation aimed at overthrowing Tito and organizing a new Balkan alliance, with Prime Minister Dimitrov as its leader. According to British sources spreading this rumor, the following changes are expected: (1) Appointing supporters of Stalin as leaders of the Greek Communist Party, because Markos is considered too nationalistic. They will agree to cede Greek Macedonia, including Thessaloniki, to the Balkan alliance. (2) Engaging in propaganda and organizing a Balkan alliance including Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania. (3) Strengthening the anti-Tito movement in Macedonia. Cominform propagandists will allow Macedonians to organize a Greater Macedonia, and the rise of anti-Tito elements may allow Macedonia to secede from Yugoslavia, which could lead to the downfall of Tito's regime.</p>
<h3>Soviet Rejection of Yugoslav Protest</h3>
<p>[London, Central News Agency, 11th, United Press] According to TASS: Yugoslavia has protested to the Soviet Union for being excluded from the Eastern European Economic Mutual Assistance Association and demanded that treaty provisions be observed to stop discrimination against Yugoslavia. The Soviet Union has rejected this protest, arguing that Yugoslavia has adopted a hostile attitude toward the Soviet Union and has isolated itself from the Moscow Conference.</p>
<h3>Truman and Churchill to Meet in Early April</h3>
<p>[Washington, Agence France-Presse, 11th] The White House announced tonight that Churchill and Truman will speak at Cambridge "University Town" near Boston on March 31st and April 1st, respectively. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has invited the two statesmen to attend the 50th anniversary celebration of the university's founding. Churchill delivered a memorable speech in Fulton, Missouri, on March 5, 1946, arguing that the Soviet Union was aiming for unlimited expansion and that if peace was to be guaranteed, it was urgent to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union within the United Nations on various contentious issues. Churchill also advocated a permanent alliance between the United States and Britain.</p>
<h3>Expulsion of Diplomats Stationed in Hungary: The United States Takes Retaliatory Action</h3>
<p>[Washington, United Press, 11th] On the 8th, the United States took retaliatory action against Hungary's expulsion of two U.S. diplomats, ordering Hungarian Embassy First Secretary Florian to leave the country as soon as possible. This matter has been notified to Hungarian Minister Sick by the State Department, but the reasons were not explained.</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Arrives in Washington to Discuss North American Joint Defense; Norwegian Foreign Minister Completes Mission and Returns Home Via Britain</h3>
<p>[Washington, United Press, 12th] President Truman met with Canadian Prime Minister Laurent today to hold informal discussions on Canada's participation in North American defense. Laurent arrived here on the evening of the 11th at Truman's invitation. This is his first visit to the United States since succeeding as Canadian Prime Minister last November. During his two-day stay here, he will also meet with Secretary of State Acheson, other cabinet members, and congressional leaders. Although his visit is officially considered to be social in nature, Laurent has indicated that he will raise the future of U.S. bases in Newfoundland during his talks here.</p>
<p>Based on a wartime agreement with Britain, the United States enjoys the right to lease three strategic air force bases in Newfoundland for 99 years. Newfoundland will become a province of Canada on May 31st of this year. Canada recognizes the U.S. right to lease these bases but hopes to place these bases under joint U.S.-Canadian management based on the defense agreement signed by the United States and Canada in 1947. U.S. and Canadian officials also predict that commercial issues and the planned North Atlantic Treaty will be discussed. Laurent himself has long been a strong advocate for the treaty. Truman and Acheson may inform Laurent of the progress of the treaty negotiations, including the results of recent talks with Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange.</p>
<p>[Washington, United Press, 11th] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange has concluded discussions with the U.S. government on the North Atlantic Alliance Treaty. Lange is scheduled to fly to London tonight and will depart for his home country after visiting the British Foreign Secretary. Before his departure, he met with U.S. Secretary of State Acheson for ten minutes and issued a joint communiqué stating that "the Norwegian Foreign Minister came to the United States to seek information on the North Atlantic Treaty. He had a frank and detailed discussion with the U.S. Secretary of State on the goals and nature of the alliance and provided opinions on Norwegian security issues. All aspects have been carefully considered, but no decisions have been made."</p>
<h3>Inukai Faction of the Democratic Party Decides to Join the New Cabinet</h3>
<p>Most of the New Cabinet's Personnel Have Been Tentatively Decided</p>
<p>[Tokyo, New Asia News Agency, 12th] Yoshida's new cabinet will be formed within three to four days, so the new prime minister's investiture ceremony will be held in the Imperial Palace at the same time as the appointment ceremony for the new cabinet members. Regarding the Democratic Party, regardless of whether internal divisions occur within the party, the Inukai faction has decided to cooperate with Yoshida to complete the conservative coalition government. In the future, two or three Democratic Party members from the Inukai faction may join the cabinet.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The work of forming the third Yoshida cabinet in Japan has now begun. On the morning of the 12th, Yoshida met with Ohno and Hirokawa to discuss the matter. It is reported that Hirokawa has already prepared a list of new cabinet members and chairmen of various committees of the Diet and submitted it to Yoshida for reference. Yoshida seems to have indicated that he can accept this list, but a final decision can only be made after Democratic Party President Inukai Ken submits his party's list of candidates to join the cabinet. It is said that the list submitted by Hirokawa includes Oya Shozo (Finance), Masutani Hideji (Justice), Hayashi Joji (Health and Welfare), Mori Kota郎 (Agriculture and Forestry) or Shuto Hideo to continue in their posts. Masuda Koshichi (Labor, continuing in his post), Aoki Takayoshi (Chief of the National Police Agency), and Ozawa Sajo喜 (Chief Cabinet Secretary). This list still leaves several vacancies for the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Construction, and State Ministers, so that members of the House of Councillors or the Democratic Party can be considered. According to Hirokawa's suggestion, the position of Foreign Minister in the new cabinet should still be held concurrently by the Prime Minister, so that the Prime Minister can have more direct contact with MacArthur Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Sends a Letter to the Four Powers Conference, Does Not Mention Compensation Claims Against Austria; Yugoslavia's Shift Towards the United States to Seek Assistance is Quite Subtle</h3>
<p>[Our News] London, 12th Radio: Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Bebler sent a letter to the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference today, which did not mention compensation claims, which is considered noteworthy here. This is because previous negotiations on the Austrian peace treaty broke down due to Yugoslavia's insistence on compensation of 150 million U.S. dollars and border disputes. Bebler's letter revealed that he first consulted with U.S. representative Libel. The fact that the Yugoslav representative consulted with the United States first instead of seeking assistance from the Soviet Union is highly valued here.</p>

Shanghai Municipal Councilors present as observers included: Zhang Zhongyuan, Jiang Jizhou, Wang Xianqing, Mei Hao, Cao Jun, etc. The meeting was temporarily chaired by Xu Ji, Vice Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council. After the rituals were performed, hundreds of peace pigeons were released on the balcony of the venue by the China Victory Homing Pigeon Association amidst the music, flying randomly. Photography reporters competed to take pictures as a symbol of the imminent arrival of peace. After the opening speech by the temporary chairman Xu Ji, guest Supervisory Committee member Ni Bi delivered a speech. The opening ceremony ended at 3:20 PM. The preparatory meeting and the first general meeting followed immediately. First, Xiang Changquan, the temporary Secretary-General of the meeting, reported on the preparation process of the National Peace Promotion Association. Then, the agenda of the meeting was approved, and an 11-member presidium was elected.

Xu Ji was the Secretary of the meeting, and Xiang Changquan was the Deputy Secretary-General. The examination of proposals for the meeting was undertaken by the presidium, and the declaration was also decided to be drafted by the presidium and submitted to the meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>Because it was still early after the end of the preparatory meeting yesterday, the first general meeting was held immediately. The presidium temporarily nominated He Chengjun, Speaker of the Hubei Provincial Council, as chairman. Because Mr. He's illness had not fully recovered, he declined the nomination. Therefore, Pei Mingyu, Speaker of the Shandong Provincial Council, was nominated as chairman of the meeting. After a brief speech by the chairman, the temporary motion of Huang Tong, representative of the Shaanxi Provincial Council, was first discussed, recommending representatives to visit Mr. Yan Huiqing and others in Shanghai who represent the people for peace. Subsequently, it was passed that the presidium should handle the matter.

Immediately, Pan Gongzhan, Pei Mingyu, and Wang Xiaolai were nominated as representatives of the association to visit Mr. Yan Huiqing, expressing the earnest expectations of all the representatives of the National Peace Promotion Association for Yan and others to go north. They sincerely hope that the sincere desire for peace of the people nationwide, especially the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire, can be fully stated to the CCP authorities, striving for them to accept public opinion, issue a ceasefire order, and appoint representatives as soon as possible to begin peace talks. The entire association is eagerly awaiting good news and is willing to be a supporter. Mr. Yan expressed his acceptance and promised to convey the message to Mr. Zhang Shizhao and Jiang Yong.</p>
<p>The association will continue to hold its second general meeting from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM today (13th) to discuss the proposals. The third general meeting is scheduled to be held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM tomorrow (14th), and the fourth general meeting will be held from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM that afternoon, followed by the closing ceremony.</p>
<h3>The People's Indisputable Duty to Mediate Disputes: Xu Ji's Opening Speech Presents Three Points of View</h3>
<p>The following are excerpts from the speeches of Xu Ji, Ni Bi, Guo Weiping, Wang Xiaolai, and others: Xu Ji said in his opening speech: Today is the opening day of the National Peace Promotion Association. I remember that a month ago, Speaker Pan and I initiated an invitation to the speakers and deputy speakers or responsible representatives of the provincial and municipal councils across the country, the directors or standing directors of national professional organizations, and representatives of national women's organizations to come to Shanghai to solemnly convene a national peace promotion meeting standing on the people's position, in order to jointly discuss how to promote a peaceful solution. At that time, we believed that stopping the war was the unanimous desire of the people across the country. Shanghai has been the site of several peaceful unification conferences in our country since the Xinhai Revolution, and the successful historical facts are still fresh in our memories. Moreover, its convenient transportation and the attention of China and foreign countries are especially conducive to the peace movement. Therefore, we dared to initiate the invitation to hold a meeting in Shanghai. Fortunately, representatives from all over the country have come to Shanghai to participate despite the long journey. On behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Council, I would like to express my gratitude to everyone.</p>
<p>Since the initiation of this meeting until now, for a period of one month, the government authorities have gradually adopted various measures to seek peace. President Chiang, in order to comply with public opinion, issued a New Year's Day message, advocating peace, and on January 21st, he took the lead in resigning in order to eliminate the scourge of war. After Acting President Li took office, he more actively sent representatives for peace negotiations to contact the CCP to discuss the time and location for talks. Recently, he also allowed Mr. Qiu Zhizhong and other gentlemen from Nanjing and Mr. Yan Junren and other gentlemen from Shanghai to fly to Beiping as private individuals to discuss peace issues with the CCP authorities. All of these demonstrate the sincerity of the government in seeking peace, which has been seen by the people of the world. As for the CCP, we have heard in the broadcasts of the CCP's responsible authorities that they are also very willing to resolve disputes through peaceful negotiations. The only problem is the so-called "preparations are not yet ready." In principle, whether it is the government authorities or the CCP authorities, if everyone truly thinks for the people, then there should be no problem in resolving disputes peacefully. Therefore, we should be optimistic about the future of peace. However, what exactly is the key to why peace negotiations cannot proceed smoothly now? Peaceful unification is indeed what everyone wants. Heaven sees as the people see, heaven hears as the people hear, and the people's likes and dislikes are already obvious. None of our common people do not hope for the early realization of peace, and the government and the CCP have not said that they do not want peace. Why can't peace be realized immediately? From the perspective of us people, what kind of peace do we need? I believe that we people all have the right to criticize and advocate. As long as we people do not give up our own rights, anything cannot be contrary to the unanimous will of the people across the country.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the peace talks between the government and the CCP can begin, there may be disputes along the way, then the responsibility of mediating disputes, we local representatives of public opinion, professional representatives, can represent the needs of the people to make choices. Therefore, since peace is the key to the survival of the people's lives, then the responsibility of mediating disputes, we people also have an indisputable duty.</p>
<p>Since We Want to Talk Peace, We Don't Need to Fight Anymore</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the lives of us common people, the country has resisted the aggression of Japanese imperialism for eight years, followed by three years of civil war. What has been sacrificed is nothing more than the lives and property of the common people, and the country's vitality has reached a point where the people are in dire straits and the country is in a state of irreparable ruin. If the war does not stop again, I am afraid that the Chinese nation will truly face the crisis of extinction. Therefore, we feel that we must not only shout "peace," but we are almost shouting "save our lives." Because we want to save our lives, we also advocate that since we have to sit at the conference table to talk anyway, we don't need to fight anymore now, nor should we fight anymore. In other words, both sides should immediately implement a general ceasefire on all fronts. Only an immediate ceasefire can show both sides' sincerity towards peace. I am honored to be nominated by the organizing committee of this association to serve as the temporary chairman at the opening of this conference. I feel that my virtue is weak and my ability is scarce, and I am ashamed to be up to the task. However, I deeply feel that everyone has a responsibility to promote peace, so I took on the task rashly. Fortunately, this conference will also elect a presidium. I hope that distinguished figures from all over the country and leaders from all walks of life can express their opinions freely at this historic and rare gathering. If this conference can achieve something, it will not only be the good fortune of my colleagues, but also the good fortune of the compatriots across the country and the good fortune of the Chinese nation. The above three points are my personal shallow views, and I can only provide them to you for reference. I also ask for your guidance.</p>
<p>Speech by Vice Speaker Xu (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Member's Opinion on Peace Talks</p>
<p>Guest Supervisory Committee member Ni Bi said in his speech that the significance of this conference lies in promoting peace, which is the common desire of the people across the country, because without peace, the people cannot survive. I heard that the price of rice has reached 10,000 yuan per stone. In this way, the people must face the threat of war and the pressure of life at the same time. How can they survive? Our Supervisory Committee's opinions on seeking peace are: (1) have the courage to admit defeat; (2) properly negotiate conditions; (3) eliminate obstacles; (4) rectify discipline.</p>
<p>The People of Gansu Advocate Eight Points</p>
<p>Guo Weiping, Deputy Speaker of the Gansu Provincial Council, said in his speech: The northwest is a poor and sparsely populated area with complex ethnic groups and a special environment. Everyone is very concerned. Fortunately, since Mr. Zhang Wenbai arrived, he has been calling for peace, democracy, unity, and solidarity, which has won the support of all parties. Currently, he is protecting the territory and people and striving for comprehensive peace. This is to reassure you all. As for the opinions of the people of Gansu on peace, there are the following eight points, which are provided to you for reference: (1) Peace should be based on equality and mutual understanding. (2) Both sides should implement an immediate ceasefire. (3) Convene a political consultative conference of representatives from all parties, all legal entities, all regions, and social elites across the country. (4) Maintain the legal system of the Republic of China, and the constitution can be amended in accordance with the law. (5) Implement the policy of regulating capital and equalizing land ownership based on the Principle of People's Livelihood. (6) Guarantee the people's freedom of life. (7) The army belongs to the country, and no party may use force as a tool. (8) All peace talks should be carried out under the leadership of the central government as a nationwide unified action.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Has Two Thoughts and Three Beliefs</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai of the General Chamber of Commerce delivered a speech: Today, the National Peace Promotion Association is discussing the peace issue that the people of the whole country are most concerned about. Xiaolai has two thoughts and three beliefs. The so-called two thoughts are one of joy and one of fear: (1) What is the joy? Although the conditions for negotiation between the two sides are still quite far apart, the need for peace and the pursuit of peace by the people of the whole country have been recognized by the authorities on both sides. From the standpoint of our people, we sincerely hope that the thirty-eighth year of the Republic of China can become a truly peaceful year. If this is the case, then the two sides will dispel suspicions and make peace, and stop fighting in order to promote martial arts, which will naturally become the democratic and correct track for resolving political disputes in the new political history of modern China, and can also lay the foundation and establish a model from now on. (2) What is the fear? Recently, there have been rumors that the two sides have not made active preparations for the peace talks, and that the deployment of warfare, both offensive and defensive, is still frequent, and even that the Third World War will be triggered by our country. What the heart fears is a cold and shivering feeling. The above two emotions, I believe, are also felt by all of you attending this meeting. The most important topic of today's meeting is how to make what we hope for realized as soon as possible, and to eliminate what we fear as soon as possible. In other words, it is the path for good people to strengthen their belief and efforts in the future of peace. Now, the serious opportunity for the country's peace is flickering, and I deeply hope that the authorities on both sides will have the sincerity of mutual tolerance and concession, embrace the attitude of impartiality and fairness, abandon personal interests, take care of the overall situation, and work together to save the situation. Our basic creed for the future of peace is nothing more than three points: (1) Respecting the inherent morality of the nation, promoting the inherent spirit of the nation, neither being the master nor entering slavery. Integrate the social thoughts of the East and the West, and formulate a thorough reform and progress in politics and economy in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the domestic reality. (2) Maintaining an absolutely detached position, striving to resolve difficulties and disputes, without relying on or being partial to anything. Gathering wisdom and considering the conditions proposed by both sides as the initial basis for peace talks between the two sides, and then agreeing on new reform plans in political, economic, military and other aspects, and determining whether they are feasible based on the will of the whole people, and promoting their realization with the power of the whole people. (3) Recognize the current crisis of the country, which lies in the direction of the people's hearts, and do not delay or be too激. 推诫商权，當機之斷。 Everything should be based on the will of the people, the welfare of the people, and the establishment of a new China that is truly owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people.</p>
<h3>Fellow Provincial, City, and County Associations Recommend Representatives to Appeal for Peace</h3>
<p>The fourth joint meeting of the fellow provincial, city, and county associations in Hong Kong passed the following proposals at 2:00 PM yesterday: (1) Recommending ten representatives to appeal for peace, including Wang Xiaolai, He Yaozu, Liang Lieya, Kui Yanfang, Ma Junshuo (the five representatives who have not been recommended will be recommended by the various fellow provincial associations separately, and then reported to the conference in writing for decision). (2) Telegraphing the Kuomintang and the Communist Party again to appeal for peace and stop the war. (3) Requesting the peace representatives to depart on a selected date to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to appeal for peace.</p>
<h3>More Than 100 Cases of Private Schools Charging Fees Beyond Limits, The Education Bureau Decides to Sort Them Out Within Days and Dispatch Personnel to Investigate and Stop Them Separately</h3>
<p>Although the fee standards for private schools at all levels in this city have been approved by Mayor Wu, the schools have not complied with them. They have created various names and charged fees beyond limits in disguised forms, causing parents of students to write to the Education Bureau to report them. As of yesterday, the Education Bureau has received more than 100 letters of complaint. Among them, there are more than 40 schools in the middle school department, including Zhongzheng, Guangxia, Huizhong, Shijie, Nanmo, Qixiu, Xiaoguang, and Aurora, and more than 30 schools in the elementary school department, including Jianhua, Qingbai, Bingsheng, Zhengying, Weiyu, Peiguang, Yuying, Zhengzhong, Luzhi, Jinghai, Zhaofeng, and Ziqiang.

<h3>Rice Prices Soar, Mayor Enraged, If Grain Merchants Fail to Sell Within the Time Limit, They Will Be Punished Severely According to Military Law</h3>
<p>The price of rice in Shanghai soared yesterday. The black market price of white rice even approached 10,000 yuan. The rice market formed a stalemate and could not open for trading. After Mayor Wu was informed, he summoned representatives of rice merchants at 5:00 PM to inquire about the situation and inquired in detail about the trading situation of various rice firms. He then learned that the number of people who sold rice based on the government's sales of rice with National Identity Card No. 5 had reached more than 130,000, and the number of people who sold rice based on National Identity Card No. 6 was reported to be less than 2,000, with a total of less than 100 shi, which was far from the original order of 5,000 shi per day for each rice firm. This was obviously a malpractice, so he ordered all the representatives of the rice merchants to be detained. After the representatives of the rice merchants repeatedly requested, he changed the order and ordered each firm to submit a guarantee and temporarily allowed them to go out, and set a deadline of the 16th to submit a clear list of the number of sales in accordance with the original method of selling 5,000 shi per day. If they still refused or made other excuses, they would be sent to the garrison headquarters for strict punishment in accordance with military law for disrupting the people's hearts and destroying the market.</p>

<h3>In Order to Prevent the Index of This Period from Being Excessively Disconnected, Another Price Survey Will Be Conducted on the 14th</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] Prices are rising daily, and the lives of citizens are under serious threat. The salaried class with meager income is especially in a state of panic. The consumer price index for the upper period of this month is also the object of most concern to the public, so "index predictors" have speculated, some saying 250 times, and others saying 300 times. However, it is impossible to find the correct answer before the municipal government's statistics are completed. However, the municipal authorities and the labor circles in this city have indeed discussed several times to find ways to prevent the index from being excessively disconnected from prices. The original plan was to conduct the last price survey for this period's index yesterday. It is now learned that the municipal government has accepted the suggestion of the General Labor Union and decided to conduct another price survey on the 14th. Zhou Xuexiang, the chairman of the Municipal General Labor Union, has also frequently contacted various parties, requesting the capital side to generally issue salaries earlier or borrow a portion to reduce the losses suffered by workers due to the rising tide, and at the same time, requiring the index compilation to be absolutely accurate and reasonable.</p>

<p>[This newspaper reports] Hualian only defeated Renyu by six points in the basketball league last night, with a score of 43 to 37. The first half was 21 to 15, also a difference of six points. The Renyu Youth Army fought with all their might, performed brilliantly, and worked hard. With this achievement, it is quite impressive. Cai Jindian's absence was not without influence. In the women's group, Xinghua defeated St. John's, 40 to 33. The first half was 23 to 13, with St. John's behind.

<h3>The Export Promotion Office Discusses Plans to Promote the Export of Gauze</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] The plan to export gauze, which was previously submitted by the Textile Export Committee to the Executive Yuan, has now been approved by the Executive Yuan. However, the committee will be dissolved soon, and its business will be taken over by the Export Promotion Office of the Import and Export Control Committee. Chen Junren, the director of the office, specially invited Rong Erren and Wang Zijian of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association, Song Lifeng and Zhang Silu of the Textile Construction Company, and Liu Jianhua of the Export Committee yesterday to discuss how to promote the export plan. As a result, a method for the Import and Export Control Committee to manage the export of gauze was drafted, with five key points: (1) The export quota of gauze is based on 30% of the total production of the national gauze factories in 1948. If necessary, it can be increased or decreased with the approval of the competent authority. (2) Regarding the export quota of each factory and the price of gauze for export and cotton, a representative from the Joint Management Office of Cotton Yarn and Cloth, two representatives from the Textile Construction Company, and two representatives from private factories will form an organization to review and approve them. (3) A linkage system will be adopted for gauze export and raw material import. (4) Gauze export is limited to members of the Cotton Textile Association. (5) The foreign exchange earned from gauze export is limited to purchasing machinery, raw materials, dyes, fuels, and other necessary machines and materials needed by various factories.</p>

<h3>Gauze Shows Strength</h3>
<p>The gauze market reports all items outside the trading circle are rising strongly, and credit is very loose (day-to-day interest rates are around 40 yuan).

Leading fine cloth was initially quoted at 13,000 yuan outside the market, but near noon, some trades were reported at 12,500 yuan.

<h3>Silk Prices Rise and Then Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market saw a surge in prices due to the sharp rise in the black market price of gold certificates outside the trading circle. A range of commodity prices followed suit. Credit in the market loosened, and turnover within the industry became easier, leading to a surge in new purchases. 120 Heaven Bridge opened at 440,000 yuan. After opening, demand was strong, and the market continued to show strength. Near noon, news of stock prices rising and then falling, and gold prices also showing weakness, caused credit to tighten slightly. Furthermore, with the atmosphere of peace talks becoming slightly clearer, bulls sold off at high levels, and the upward momentum stabilized. Noon closing was at 457,000 yuan, up 50,000 yuan. In the afternoon, due to it being Saturday, there was no trading within the market. Outside the market, prices were quoted at 435,000 yuan for 120 Heaven Bridge due to the sharp fall in gold prices, but there were no formal transactions.</p>
<p>The spot price of raw silk continued to rise due to the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates rising and the black market price of gold certificates surging, stimulating public sentiment. Superior grade small lots opened in the morning at 440,000 yuan, and soon rose to 460,000 yuan. After the high, many who had bought floating positions yesterday began to sell, and the market softened. However, because commodity prices outside the trading circle did not decline, prices stabilized after softening, and the noon closing was at 455,000 yuan. There was little trading in the afternoon due to Saturday, but the sharp fall in gold prices caused a sharp decline in confidence, and quoted prices also showed a slight decline.</p>
<p>Yesterday, silk and satin prices all followed the upward trend. Huaqiang bedding fabric was initially traded at 245,000 yuan. In the middle of the day, favorable news spread frequently, and the market rose sharply, repeatedly reaching new highs, approaching the 300,000 mark. People's sentiment was still high. Subsequently, news of falling futures prices and weakening gold prices dampened buying interest, and market prices fell slightly by over 10,000 yuan, finally closing at 280,000 yuan. There were no transactions in the market in the afternoon. Outside the market, due to the impact of the sharp fall in gold prices, many holders hurriedly sold, and prices were quoted at 250,000 to 260,000 yuan.</p>

Lao Che opened initially at 4,500 yuan, and in the mid-market once hit a high of 4,600 yuan. The closing saw a slight pullback, and the asking price for the after-market was around 4,500 yuan. Qiu Chuan broke through the 4,000 yuan mark at the opening, with a mid-market high of 4,500 yuan. Near the closing, it was pulled back to 4,450 yuan. After the closing, with gold certificates and black market prices falling together, people's sentiment softened, and cargo owners were keen to sell, falling another hundred yuan. Near the closing, it traded at 4,350 yuan. Wheat bran rose sharply by 30%, with large bags being traded at a high of 3,200 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains Under the loose credit conditions, oil factories were heavily buying yellow soybeans, raw kernels, and sesame seeds. Cargo owners were holding firm, and the upward trend became more intense. Zha beans jumped by 45%, opening at 8,000 yuan. Che beans rose by 2,000, and Pinghu Du beans hit the 10,000 yuan mark. Raw kernels generally rose by about 30%, and Yangzhou Ti Zhuang broke the 20,000 mark. Sesame transactions have been quiet for days, but yesterday oil factories took notice, and transactions turned more active. Rice sales were relatively sluggish, and the upward trend slowed slightly.</p>
<p>Edible Oil Prices have not finished rising sharply. Yesterday, the market opened with another surge, then suddenly turned back at the close. Soybean oil opened at 48,000 yuan, and once hit the 50,000 yuan mark. At the close, news of falling gold prices caused a sharp decline in confidence. Floating positions were sold, and prices fell straight down to 45,000 yuan, a rise of 5,000. Rapeseed oil opened early at 42,000, closing at 39,000, also up 5,000. Jibao crude oil was priced at 50,000, closing at 52,000 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil, refined oil, and sesame oil all rose first and then fell. Soybean cake rose by 500 to 600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Firm and Strong</h3>
<p>After red and green tea inventories approached depletion, coupled with the consistent and sudden sharp rise in financial items and commodities in recent days, holders' thoughts became sharper and sharper, and the intention to sell turned even firmer. Therefore, although buyers were pleased, the lack of supply made it difficult to boost transactions. The underlying trend repeatedly showed its strength, and prices reached peaks, which is quite alarming.</p>
