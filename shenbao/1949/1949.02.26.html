<h3>李代總統飛返首都　集京要員將有重要會商　孫科程潛即可分別趕來</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕李代總統自廿日起至廿五日止，六日來先後飛歷廣州·桂林·長沙·漢口四地巡視，已完成其視事以來之首次南巡，於廿五日下午五時十分，自漢乘自强號專機返抵京。專機降落明故宮飛運大隊機塲，在京之政府軍政要員童冠賢·吳鐵城·何應欽·張治中·吳忠信·徐永昌·白崇禧·顧祝同·洪蘭友·賀耀組·黃紹茲·李大超·劉爲章·陳克文·黃伯度·葉公超·倪烱聲·張壽賢·張耀明·　傑·黃珍吾·許靜之·劉士毅·朱華封等數十人均至機塲歡迎。專機於下午五時十分着陸，吳鐵城·張治中等均迎於取機門前，李代總統下機後，卽首與吳鐵城握手，並稱：「你來了！　」旋與各歡迎者一一握手致意。時何應欽被歡迎羣擠於一旁，隨從某君當卽吿知李代總統：「敬公在此！」李代總統又趨前與何氏握手，並呼「敬公！敬公！」白崇禧·吳忠信均係抱病往迎，李代總統與白氏握手時，白忙將手杖置於一旁。機塲中充滿熱烈鏡頭。李代總統今着西裝，外罩黑色大衣，雖數日旅途勞頓，然精神仍至充沛，旋卽乘車返傳厚崗官邸休息。隨李代總統出巡之甘介侯·邱昌渭·黃雲邨·程思遠·李宇淸等均同機返京，立委掌永成亦自桂隨機同來。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕行將在首都舉行之中樞及地方要員重要會商，因李代總統廿五日返京，可能於二三日內開始，官方人士對此項會商已不予否認，惟稱此次並非集會，而係商談性質，商談內容爲當前大局及對中共和談問題。該人士雖不願透露此次會商係內部團結重於時局決策，然事實證明，在此次會談中，將使中樞地方意見完全一致俾就已露曙光之和平前途再作努力。李代總統此次南巡，歷粵·桂·鄂·湘四省，與各地首長及地方人士交換意見，對意見之統一，顯已收良好結果，此行亦可視爲首都重要會商之前奏，蓋李代總統與孫科院長在穗數次長談後，二人意志已完全一致。據悉：參加此項會商之要員，將包括在京之何應欽·吳鐵城。徐永昌·桂永淸·周至柔·顧祝同，由漢來京相候之白崇禧，由西北來京之張治中，及行政院各首長，卽將由湘來京之程潛及卽將由渝來京之張羣等，如屆時赴平之邵力子·顏惠慶等已南返，亦將應邀參加，惟因此次會談非集會性質，故孫科由穗到京後可能卽行開始。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕長沙綏靖主任程潛，卽將於二三日內由湘來京，此爲李代總統過長沙邀請程氏時所作之決定。李代總統係邀程氏來京參與對當前大局商討之集會。</p>

<h3>李代總統孫院長　意見不洽非事實　黃雪邨接見記者談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕李代總統發言人總統府第二局局長黃雪邨返京後，接見記者談：李代總統此次南巡，先後視察廣州·桂林·長沙·漢口四地，結果均甚圓滿，各地方政府首長，各界人士，對于政府之和平決策，均一致表示擁護，李代總統在穗與孫院長數度交換意見，孫院長已表示日內卽將來京，外傳李代總統與係院長之意見未盡融洽之說已可證明其並非事實。至李代總統邀約各地重要首長如張洽中，程潛等來京，亦僅係就當前大局交換意見，幷非有具體形式之會議。記者詢以桂林國代曾上書李代總統，請充分執行職櫂，有無其事？黃氏答：長沙漢口亦有相同之表示。記者問：李代總統宣佈非戰區取消戒嚴令，各地曾未執行？黃氏答：廣州桂林畏沙等地，現在均朱戒嚴，漢口是否仍在戒嚴，因在漢未曾久停，故未詳詢。記者問：滬報廣州電曾記載李代總統對穗國代訓話，有：「如共軍渡江卽打到底」之語，是否屬實？黃氏稱：並未聞李代總統曾作此語。記者中有以邵力子有無報吿？和談有何進展？釋放張學良楊虎城按術問題有無解決等問題相詢者，黃氏均以「離京數日，尙無材料」爲答。</p>
<h3>招待武漢各界席上　李代總統剴切致詞　闡明和平真義　提示改革政治三要點</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿五日電〕李代總統今午自湘蒞漢巡視，甘介侯·印昌渭·黃雪邨·程思遠·韋永成等同來。先是，代總統專機原定今晨九時到達，武漢各機關法團首長二百餘人，均準時趕赴機場恭迎，鵠候逾三小時，突聞西南天示機聲軋軋，歡迎人員倍感興奮。十二時十分自强號專機徐徐降落機塲，李氏於軍樂悠揚聲中下機，首由聖羅易女生三人代表武漢市民獻花致敬。旋李氏於檢閱儀仗隊後，卽由勦總副總司令徐祖詒。李品仙兩氏陪同乘車進入市區，沿途市民夾道歡迎，爭覩手采，掌聲與鞭砲聲不絕於耳，代總統頻頻揮帽向市民示意，借顯熱烈親切，一時許抵勦總官邸休憇，幷進午餐，在座者除剿總高級將領外，尙有張寫倫。朱鼎鄉·夏威·晏勳甫等行政首長，席間對地方情形垂詢頗詳。午後二時一刻，代總統在德明飯店舉行茶會，招待武漢各界，幷卽席致詢。李氏首稱：今日世界人類無不期待和平建設，消弭戰爭，中國人遭受戰禍最慘重，渴望和平亦最迫切，深信此種民心所向，無人可以拂逆，和平志願必可圓滿達成。李氏對目前少數頑同份子尙未了解和平眞義，認爲應予宣導糾正。據稱：「綜觀中外歷史，凡迷信武力脫離民衆者，無論任何政治集團，均必陷於分崩離析之結局，吾人必須接受血的敎訓，承認失敗原因，共爲和平建國而努力，本人深感賣任艱鉅，但赴湯蹈火，早具決心，一切困難危險，均非個人所顧慮，今後和平建設是否成功，全視全國人民是否竭誠督促。論及改革政治，李氏提示三點：（一）爲解除人民疾苦，一面須兼顧民生，安定經濟，一面尤須尊重言論與行動之自由，取消人民的精神束縛，以期走入民主坦途。（二）要刷新政治，必先整肅紀彌，掃除貪汚，改變一切陳腐作風，澈底爲人民謀利益。（三）目前急務，應裁撤駢技機關，剷除推諉牽制之積弊，並採取精兵主義，調整軍事體系，以節省國庫，减輕人民負担。至此，李氏復强調稱此革政治，與致力和平，為全國上下一致要求，切盼大家團結力量，共同邁進。衆皆報以熱烈掌聲。最後，由鄂省耆宿李盡城到詞，謂代總統所示各點，與渠在中共區所見者並無多大衝突，如能繼續努力和平，前途至可樂觀。三時廿分，代總統一行，於羣衆歡呼中離漢飛京，各機關首長均至機場恭送。按李氏留漢僅三小時，匆忙中鮮與外界接觸。</p>
<h3>湘各界歡迎會議長提四請求</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙廿五日電〕溝各界廿五日上左九時舉行歡迎李代總統大會，李氏致詞後，湘省參會唐議長伯球，向總統提兩點意見：（一）嚴整紀綱，革新政治；（二）顧念人民痛苦，安定民生·由此兩意見，復向代總統提下列請求：（一）請總統排除萬難，澈底實施七項和平措施：（二）過去中央對地方財政採剝削政策，幣制改革後，湘人以汗血兌金圓券，結果中央竟將長沙央行黃金運去，三萬兩黃金失去三千萬民心，殊爲不智，請總統立飭央行總行歸還。（三）徵兵徵糧弊端百出，已爲總統所深知，希總統立卽停徵兵糧。（四）過去資委會管制湘特鑛太不合理，請飭卽解除。散會後，卽赴機塲，十一時起飛赴漢，程主席以公務尙待料理，未能隨機同往。</p>
<p>〔中央社長沙二十五日電〕李代總統蒞湘巡視，留駐此間計時共二十一小時零五分，留予湘人以民主·開明·熱誠·矢志求取和平，決志革新政治之最深刻印象。</p>

<h3>財金改革新方案的批評</h3>
<p>全國矚目的財政金融改革方案，於廿三日行政院會議通過後，昨即由李代總統援用憲法上的「緊急條款」，公佈施行。這是我國幣制的再改革，有關國計民生至重且大，自然値得我們的重視；尤其在物價飛騰民不聊生的今日，這個新的財金改革方案能不能穩定金融抑平物價拯救人民於水火，當更爲全國人民所關切。</p>
<p>我國自去年八月間改革幣制以來，迄今僅有六七個月的時間，金圓券的幣値快要向老法幣看齊了！我們研究造成目前經濟危機的原因，不外乎下列三項：（一）是因爲國內戰亂未已，財政支出浩繁，國家預算無法平衡，（二）是因爲金圓券的膨脹未已，使具有金融性的金，鈔，銀圓引導物價上漲。（三）是因爲對外貿易的無法平衡，出口貿易旣陷於停頓狀態，外國貨却排山倒海而來，造成空前的入超。所以這次政府所採取的財金改革新方案，自然是針對這三個弊端而發；但其能否奏效，似乎還是不可樂觀過早。</p>
<p>第一，關於財政方面，新方案採取下列各項辦法。。（一）將本年內軍事上所需物資及經費，作一通盤之估計，並預爲切實可靠的簍劃及準備。（二）依照本年度的施政方針，編訂預算，務使一切經費開支，有所範圍，不致有加倍的追加預算。（三）改訂財政牧支系統，田賦完全歸諸地方政府，使各省市不再仰賴國庫的補助。（四）停止徵借糧食。（五）海關進口稅，以關元計算繳納。（六）貨物稅將依照稅率微收實物。（七）鹽稅得照貨物稅辦理。（八）直接我中之營利事業所得稅，德量採取同業分攤包繳辦法。表面看來，這些措置似乎都非常切實易行，不難使國家的財政收支達到平衡的理想，但按之實際，這八項辦法，一言以蔽之，仍不外「開源節流」四個大字。我們不必高談理論，姑且以目前的實際情形而霄，新方案中關於財政的辦法，能否完全奏效，恐怕還是間題。老實說，在和戰未定局勢日趨嚴重的今日，軍需若干，政費若干，目前誰也不能作確切的估計，誰也不能保證政府編訂預算之後不再提出追加預算，即使要節流，非政府眞有大刀闊斧不怕得罪人的決心，是依然辦不到的。其次政府想開源，關稅以關元繳納，稅收徵取實物，並爲减少補助地方政府起見，特別放寬地方徵稅限制，這些辦法是否即能增加政府的收入達到財政平衡的理想，恐怕也是問題。</p>
<p>第二，關於金融幣制者，新方案規定的重要辦法有三：（一）黃金白銀准許人民買賣，中央銀行亦得爲金銀之買賣。（二）銀元准許流通，政府並得籌購白銀鼓鑄銀元。（三）外國貨幣仍禁止流通，中央銀行依照金價及外匯證價格收兌外幣。這三項辦法可以說是我國政府金融措置的「還原」辦法。在改革幣制時，不許人民持有，史不許人民買賣，只許兌興政府。而爲時未久，改變初衷，准許人民持有，並由國行辦理金銀存兌辦法，曾幾何時，而存兌辦法停止。現在則索與准許人民自由買賣，兜了一個大　子，又走到了原來出發的老路上。這種九九歸一的「還原」政策，倒是中國政府特有的發明。再就實效而言，新方案能否收「稱定金融」的功效，還要看財政當局有無持久拋售大量金銀的決心而定。假如仍舊和從前的作風一樣，政府祗貪圖小利，處處只想與民爭利，到了黃金存底漸少時，又捨不得拋售，或甚至又要收回國有，則金融不僅無法穩定，反將因此一再的出爾反爾，更要火上加油，益增金融經濟動盪的危機！</p>
<p>第三，關於進出口貿易，除了開放自備外匯一項而外，並沒有新穎的措置。要是只此爲止，不能盡其全力以促進出口貿易，則欲求進出口貿易的平衡，到了或還是一塲空！</p>
<p>然而，話雖如此說，這個財金改革新方案，雖仍是頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，但究不失爲沒有辦法中的辦法。只要財政當局對於穩定金融，確具決心，確願老實的說輿老實的幹，並能以大刀闊斧的精神，一方面大量拋售金銀以收回金圓券，另一方面立即停止金圓券的印刷，不再乞靈於紙幣的發行，則雙管齊下，金融經濟的動盪局面不平而自平。</p>
<h3>賴樸翰將晤霍夫曼　決向美國會提援華報告　經合總署向我購買錫類</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿四日電〕經濟合作總署中國分署長賴樸翰廿四日告新聞記者稱：渠擬在此勾留數夏星期。渠在此間將與經合總署署長霍夫曼及其他經合官員有所協商，並協助經合總署向國會提出關於進一步經濟援華之報吿。</p>
<p>霍夫受最近曾向新聞記者表示；經合總署在本年度財政年六月卅日以前，可以不必請求額外之援華基金。經合總署之經濟援華計劃，由國會於去年核准繼續，直至一九四九年四月。但在經濟援華之二億七千五百萬美元撥款中，約有八千萬美元未經動用。</p>
<p>霍夫曼表示：經合總署將請求國會延長經濟援華計劃至六月底，卽以剩餘之基金爲資助。此項剩餘之基金大半由於經合總署因中國局勢不安定而中止七千萬美元之對華電建與復興計劃所留下者，一部份原擬運往華北之物資亦已宣吿中止。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿四日電　〕經濟合作總署本日所宣佈之復與支出新核准額中，包括向中菲兩國採購物資。其一爲核准德境英美佔領區向中國購買錫類及以錫為主要成份之合金三十萬元，另一爲向菲律濱購買植物織維質產品三十五萬五千美元，亦供德境英美佔領區之用。</p>

<h3>芬蘭京城傳出消息　蘇增兵北極邊界　用意殆在對挪威施威脅</h3>
<p>〔聯合社芬京廿五日電〕消息靈通人士今日稱，蘇隨著已加派軍隊開往挪威北有邊界附近，增張該地兵力。此種軍隊係自茂曼斯克軍區開出，數日不明。軍隊之移動始於上星期，顯與挪威意欲參加北大西洋防務條約有關。蘇軍對芬蘭邊蛤將否採取同樣行動，尚無跡象可尋。按蘇聯最近向挪威提議締結五不侵犯條約，挪威非但拒絕，且準備參加蘇聯痛恨之北大西洋條約。</p>

<h3>推行方案打擊投機　國行今將大拋物資　銀元存底足以控制市場　徐堪定今日飛滬公布方案實施細則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財長徐堪國行總裁劉攻芸，定今日午後自德飛抵本市，卽將召集本市金融工商領袖舉行會商，並分佈新經濟方案之實施細則。昨日國行之拋售黃金，抽緊銀根，可解釋爲新方案實施前之凖備工作，昨日午後日拆卽已提高至四十五元及五十元，今日有糖款紗款十餘億，行局又有差進，銀根將更見緊俏。一般推測國行今日將大規模拋售貴金屬及物資，全力打繫投機，使市面趨於正常，以便推行改革方案。</p>
<p>對於新經濟方案實施之前途，一般認爲成功之基本要素，爲財政士收支平街，不再膨脹發行。另一要件爲國行之銀圓存底，足以控制市塲，長期維持幣信。關於國行之銀圓存底，有五千萬，七千萬，一億枚三種估計，雖不能肯定其確數，但其實力之雄厚，無可懷疑。今後國行勢必在銀圓與金圓券之間，規定比率，加以維持，至於比率之機動或固定，一視國行之政策，二視工商業能否在長期物價穩定之狀態下，負担其開支而定。又一般觀察家均同意在短時期內，物價決不致有大波動。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕自財政金融改革方案公佈後，今後滬市有關金融技術諸問題，須俟國行總裁劉攻芸返滬後方能作具體決定。聞劉氏將於今日由穗返滬。</p>
<h3>新方案公布　金市場活躍　投機翻騰趨之若騖　每家進出一二千條　銀樓業集議復業辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕此次財金改革新方案中，業已開放金銀自由買賣。本市　伏已久之金銀市塲，昨起又吿活躍。四川路一帶之烟兌號，及證券大樓中之證券字號，昨晨黃金交易，重見熱鬧。一般經營股票或在商品市場中翻騰之投機家，又復移轉目標於金市塲，一時有趨之若驚之勢，而各金號交易，莫不利市三倍。據可靠之估計，昨日一日間，各大金號之交易，黃金平均每家約在一千條至二千條之間。今後金市交易，大致上午目九時半至中午十二時半，當日交割。下午二時至三時半，則延至翌晨一併交割。</p>
<p>買賣行市　拔開甚遠</p>
<p>據金業中人觀察：昨日金銀恢復公開買賣後，一般行市，僅憑若千大金號報出行情交易，而一般小金號，在交易繁忙時，買賣行市每十兩拔開達十萬元左右，而收盤行市，買賣行市拔開僅爲二萬元。行市參差過鉅，實有恢復集中市塲交易之必要，故若干具有悠久歷史之金號，多持保留態度，依然停業如故，蓋尙待當局將新方案全部攤牌後，方能決定復業新方針。</p>
<p>香港條塊　大多拒收</p>
<p>又昨日各金號買賣之金塊，最低成色限在九九以上，其有成色不足者，除中央銀行之廠條，按條面敲出之成色折扣外，其他冷氣貨一槪拒絕交長。卽香港之六兩條塊，亦多在拒收之列。因港條假貨太多，在交易繁忙之時，無法一一檢驗成色也。</p>
<p>本市銀樓業方面，昨會有非正式之業會，共商新方案下之復業辦法未獲定論，決於今日召開理監事會，以作最後決定。聞遲至下週一，或可恢復掛牌買賣飾金</p>
<h3>叮噹之聲　隨處可聞　龍洋等汽車見抬頭　喊價距離已縮短</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財金改革方案公佈後，本市銀元市塲頓一改昔日「地下」姿態，開始公開活動。數月來秘密集結於老北門，河南路，福州路，同孚路，霞飛路，跑馬應等地之銀元「露天市塲」，昨起尤形活躍。與警局經警組工作閒散相對，數千銀元販已毫無顧忌，交易情形異常熱烈，鄰近鬧區一帶，叮噹之聲幾隨處可聞。一般市民因聞今後各店商品卽將以銀元標價，致更羣趨市塲爭相購進，昨銀元價格本可因此扳高，但由於造幣廠中新存舊銀元日內大量拋出之說謠傳頗盛，且銀元販手中積累頭寸甚鬆，故結果僅止於每元進出金圓券一千五六百元之間。數月來始終屈居「大頭」下之「小頭」·龍洋·鷹洋·船洋·川洋等，因一般相信其成色份量初與「袁頭」無大差異，且將來可能在公開流通原則下同價使用，故亦多捨「袁頭」而購藏雜洋，其價格遂漸見抬頭，各種間喊價之距離已漸見縮短。依據昨全日情形觀察，今後短期內銀元卽可成爲一般市民常識上計値藏儲之對象，各種經營銀元買賣之商業，亦必如雨後春筍，紛紛出現。</p>
<h3>專家對方案之評論　分析三項優點　足以緩和危機</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕自財政金融改革方案公佈後，初以各方反應不一，上午一般物價比較波動，顯見各方對新方案不曾澈底了解，因而採取觀望態度，惟下午各物卽吿下瀉，據某經濟專家對新方案看法，其優點爲：（一）銀元流通可减少金圓券之發行，以抑止通貨膨脹，（二）進出口可獲發展，尤以進口可使用自備外匯推進貿易，（三）以關元計算繳稅，可增厚稅收，並能袪除過去稅收貶値之弊。又據一般人士對新方案內容之分析稱：該方案雖非極端完善，而使當前經濟問題，澈底解決，但在目前不失爲緩和危機之良劑，其中最顯著者爲發展貿易部份，自可收活潑金融市塲之效，而使游資納入正軌，市塲得以繁榮，倘政府能進而把握物資，相機調節，則物價漲風當可逐漸緩和，趨向穩定途徑。</p>
<h3>壽景偉表示希望</h3>
<p>避去病重藥輕舊方式</p>
<p>政府公佈財政金融改革案後，記者特趨訪上海市進出口商業仝業公會理事長壽景偉，詢其意見，據談，政府當局對於生產萎縮，物資缺乏之經濟危機，已有深切認識，惟物資調節及增加生產兩項治本辦法，尙未公佈，想日內定可有對症良藥之具體方案，以慰進出口同業之期望。徐財長就職之初，卽有連鎖制發展貿易之主張，而對於生產事業及出口物資貸款辦法，亦復已有成例，甚望政府切實運用金融力量，無論（一）低利生產貸款，（二）定購出口物資貨款，均能力避過去病重藥輕之舊方式，而以充分之資金適應工商界之丞切需要，則在此和平曙光已現之過程中，東南西南諸省仍可期以生產之增加，謀外匯之充裕與民生之安定云。</p>
<h3>新關元票　即將發行</h3>
<p>政府對海關進口稅，將仿照過去海關金單位制，以關元計算繳納，每關金一元停於美金四角，將由中央銀行負責發行，進口商於繳納稅賦時，可以黃金·白銀·外幣或外匯移轉體向該行兌購關元應用，該項新關金短時期內卽將開始發行，有關方面昨已在開始學備中。按戰前海關繳納關稅，一向採海關金單位制，該項關金票復被採用作貨幣，上次幣制改革後，已與法幣同被棄置不用，此次新關金避用關金名義而改稱關元，并幾定除繳納關稅外，不得在市流通。</p>
<h3>金銀公開買賣　從此不再逮捕</h3>
<p>據金融管理局局長談稱：新經濟方案公佈後，金銀銀元均准自由流通買賣，該局以前委託警察局執行之一切逮捕經營金銀黑市商人及遠捕銀元攤販之活動，已自昨日起停止。自昨日起，金銀銀元可准予自由買賣，不再爲違法之舉，惟外幣不在此列，仍禁止自由買資。至該局今後之工作，仍以檢査行莊之集務爲主，是否撇銷，須候財數都命令指示。</p>
<h3>疏散囚犯吿一段落</h3>
<p>上海監獄舉令辦環疏散囚犯工作，現已吿一段落，凡合乎疏散條例者，大部份業已開釋，目前僅有少數囚犯未出獄，獄方表示，一俟彼等覓得妥保後，當繙總釋出。</p>

<h3>大專院校長請願　教授會全力支持　對改善待遇爭承永久安定方案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕十二國立大專院校長定二十七日晚聯袂晉京，要求政府迅予改善敎職員待遇，增加經常費與發給應變費。上海國立專科以上學校敎授聯誼會對校長該一行動表示全力支持。該會發言人劉大杰昨日談稱：「此次政府調整待遇，京滬區爲七十五倍，底薪略有增加，然與本會要求依照原薪乘物價指數者相差過遠。照調整倍數計算，月薪一百六十元之助敎與職員每月只得七千五百元，卽最高級六百元之敎授，每月只得一萬六千元。在此日用品價一日數漲，水電交通費一月數增之情况下，敎授仍無法解決最低限度之生活。最可怪者，此次調整待遇，對於教授每月五十元研究費之改善數字未提，足爲敎育部輕視學術硏究之明證。因此本會特請各校校長赴京面請李代總統對於敎職員待遇謀取合理之解決。値此新經濟方案施行之時，對於改善待遇問題尤宜爭取一永久安定之方案，以銀幣或實物作標準俱可，萬不可再蹈過去待遇與物價脫節之覆轍。此次各校校長辛苦晉京，本會全體敎授決以全力支持。務望各校校長據理力爭，對此嚴重問題得一根本之解決。至於經常費之增加與應變費之補發，俱爲刻不容緩之事」云云。</p>

<p>逕啓者，查貴報所辦本學期助學金，目票原定白米五百石，或金圓五百萬元，按照過去辦理成績平說，這個目標數字並不算大，鄙人回想在抗戰時期，貴報每　屆所募助學金捐款，竟可以補助四千名清寒學學生之多，如今祇希望搶救十分之一，卽四百名，尚難達到目的，誠不勝感慨系之，鄙人為追隨貴報呼籲起見，曾於本月廿一日捐助金圓一百萬元，凑合原定目票之半數卽二百五十萬元，其餘尚缺二百五十萬地，滿望貴報在大聲疾呼之下，博得各界響應，完成目票。而時至今日，一般被搶救之清寒學生莫不此領跂望，鄙人每日翻閱貴報，不禁為之黯然神傷，心實難安，只得拘病親向友好呼籲，募得光裕堂丁先生金圓一百廿五萬元，鴻記，佐記，觀記，三位合助金圓六十萬元，鳴記，和記，二位合助六十五萬元，共計金圓二百五十萬元，送請督收。俾申請獲准之淸寒學生，早得安心攻讀，在貴報庶可完成原定目標，不辱服務社會使命，而於我亦可了却本屆助學之心願。此致申報編者先生莫須名再啓，卅八年二月五日</p>
<p>本報本屆助學金，現照澦定日期至本月底截止收款，各界如有捐款請儘於今，明，後，三天丙送達，蓋本屆目標雖已完成，但搶救失學，固多多而益善也。</p>

<p>中航在聯賽中，成續甚佳，第二循環時因陣容較弱，戰果稍差，惟全隊仍不失爲一支勁旅。前鋒棧更屬人材濟濟，極具威力，如演出正常，應可順利晉級。</p>
<p>磐隊新興强隊，麾下多年靑力壯小將，長力充沛，合作佳妙，在吳祺祥指導下，球藝猛進，上週初賽以七比一淘汰滬警，鋒芒大露，今逢中航，當不敢怠慢，屆時載力同心，定有一塲惡戰。</p>

<h3>今晚回力　戰培斐爾</h3>
<p>籃球聯賽今晚主力戰爲回力對培斐爾，回力新將來歸，近况大佳，形勢轉好，今晚逢戰美軍培斐爾，但能捷報續傳。惟美軍實力不弱，並不能過於大意。其餘二塲，開塲爲女子賽，再爲甲二組，門券價格照舊，秩序錄下：</p>
<p>黎隊—力隊（女子組）　五時卅分</p>
<p>培爾—平平（甲二C）　六時一刻</p>
<p>回力—培斐爾（甲一組）　七時一刻</p>
<p>娘十軍循例先登塲，由黎隊對抗力隊，雙方均爲第一循環最後一課，力隊已先後遭錄隊·星華·約翰之毒手，今日仍難逃敗北之命運，然全隊運動精神極好，雖敗不餒，奮鬥不懈，殊屬難得。黎隊二勝一負，上週擊潰星華，尤非易易，對亞軍一席大有希望，今日之勝，自在意中。</p>
<p>甲二C部塔爾對平平，前者曾克胖隊，具非常之鬥力，平平雖有老將王徵君夏智昂等領導，恐難挫其鋒芒。</p>
<p>甲一組回力初逢培斐爾，美軍雖五戰而五北，但每次所負不多，例如對華聯僅差五分，對仁餘僅差四分，對海靑則輸半球，由此可知其非等閒之流。回力已賽六塲，勝負參半，日前力取恩卡斯，尤見功夫，全隊作風快捷，近且得葉云山陳正淼來歸，氣勢益盛，屆時對番兵當能予以迎頭痛學</p>

<h3>新財經方案公布後　商品市場波動甚烈　國行拋售金匯漲風稍殺</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新財經方案於昨日見報後，本市市塲曾發生强烈之反響。以領導物價之金融性商品爲例，黃金每兩之價格最高達十五萬五千元，但午後之最低價僅爲十三萬八千元。美金之最高峯達三千一百元，午後最低價爲二千七百八十元左右。其餘一般生要商品行情，均爲晨間疾漲，午間回疲，終至軋小。例如白米最高峯爲每祖一萬六千元，收盤一萬四千元；廿支雙馬最高五十二萬，收盤四十六萬；粗砂糖高峯二萬七千元，收盤二萬四千元，人造絲高峯七十萬，低盤六十二萬五千元；大英香烟高峯三千，低盤二千八百元左右。固太皂高峯二萬四千，收盤二萬二。昨日行情中之特色，爲外匯移轉證之行情竟超過美金，蓋在新方案內，貿易管制已放寬，除石油及烟草外，均不列入限額，故市上紛紛以美金調取結匯證，由於供需關係，遂致美金行情低於移轉證，又昨日物價回疲之主因，爲央行之拋售，除結匯證外，黃金拋出者在一千五百條以上，銀根抽緊，人心恐慌，故如火如茶之漲風，爲之稍殺。</p>
<h3>華股臨收轉跌</h3>
<p>開盤聲勢洶洶迭見新價</p>
<p>新財經改革方案，昨已公布施行，金銀准許自由賣買，央行負責平準，人心對於股票仍具樂觀。銀根復鬆，買勢滔滔，又見新價。初開台糖卽報漲停，半小時內，永公，華豐，新亞，振漆，景福，新華，信誼，勤興，中泥，各升達漲限。一度依限成交，中程獲利者有售，同業亦賣，穩態盤滯。臨收傳聞央行拋物售金，銀根止鬆轉緊，買氣以戢。浮多倉皇了賣，跌勢轉勁。永紗，美亞，統益，榮豐，新光，景福，火柴，均以當程低價收市，比上日計各回降半分至二角，其他各股，未於臨收成交者，故尙續升三厘至二角四分。台糖獨昂一六一〇元，各股成交尙盛，半日共達四六億九七二〇萬股，內永紗一九七〇〇萬股。</p>
<h3>黃金公債還本　定三月二日抽籤</h3>
<p>黃金公債第一期債券，頃訂於三月二日舉行第一次抽籤還本，所有已售出債票，已於二十三日起，由原經售行局憑前發預約券換發正式債票，統限於今（二十六）日前換發完竣。</p>
<p>又訊：黃金短期債券，昨日國行牌價續見掛高，每兩票面定爲十萬零八千五百元。</p>
<h3>紡建繼續開售　紗市升沉互見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨續在市塲掛牌售紗，惟購者寥寥，故僅售一次，結果僅售去五〇件。請購者僅廿戶，價値三一九八萬元。各支紗開價，六支副日光，無人申請，價十九萬元。卅二支仙桃廿三件，價五四萬元。卅二支雙股喜鶴十件，價六三萬元。四二支葉股絲光彩球十七件，價七八萬元。</p>
<p>又該公司昨循例售紗予複製業，共開十種，售去一六八件，准購六九戶，價値一一一八六萬元。各支紗開價，廿支鴻福三八萬元，十六支紅月三六萬元，廿支雙股藍鳳四十五萬五千元，卅二支日光五三萬元，卅二支雙股豐年六五萬元，四〇支紅寶光六六萬元，四二支雙股龍門六七萬元，四〇支三股紅實光六八萬元，六〇支宮女九五萬元，八〇支雙股TK彩球二一〇萬元。</p>
<p>紗市呈徘徊局面，晨初開盤，因連日騰升頗鉅，人心居高思危，散戶脫手頗衆，市價較前軋小。嗣後終以業外物品皆挺，以及銀根仍鬆，市復吿回漲，結果呈漲多跌少之勢。四二支藍鳳由六十八萬五千元一路做　至七十四萬元收市，軋升二萬元。四〇支藍鳳高一萬五千元，三二支銀月自五十六萬五千元步升至五十八萬五千元爲最高，午收退至五十七萬元，路挫一萬元。二一支雙馬現出初開四十八萬元，較前昻一萬元，最後回小至四十五萬元，反降一萬元，隔日出做四十六萬五千元·二〇支雙馬微跌五千元，以四十三萬元結局。此外金城興天女等亦稍見進廠，一六支以下各級亦微步而昻，餘紗交易不多，市價上落狹隘。</p>
<h3>棉布漲勢猛烈市場迭見新價</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市勢登峯造極，以銀根依然鬆濫，人心愈見興奮，飛漲中各布再出現空前新高價。晨開龍頭細布一萬九千五百元，四君子元嗶嘰一萬八千三百元，執散戶紛粉拉抬，價步高翔，前者一度曾升至二萬〇七百元，後者一萬九千八百元。迨至午收，聞黑赤回軟，市價乃略吿回落。收市能頭細布爲一萬九千七百元，四君子元嗶嘰一萬八千七百元，較前各跳一千七百元至二千五百五十元。喇叭童細布由一萬八千一百元步昂至一萬九千元爲最高，終爲一萬八千三百元，軋漲二千三百元。B龍頭細布最後做一萬九千二百元，激挺三千四百元。四君子元直貢升二千八百元，以一萬八千九百元結局。此外一九〇士林與元布等，廠盤皆提高一成半左右。</p>
<h3>受金價上升影響　米市場漲風</h3>
<p>米價昨日狂漲甚厲，開市因金價狂升，貨主扳高。後金價疾退，米市已臨收市，故軋漲仍多。南米市塲白粳一度出一萬五千元外，薄稻亦曾高過一萬五千元。後金價跌風傳到，亦吿稍疲，收市白粳一萬四千六百元，薄稻與白粳價同，較上日軋漲三千二三百元。早稻糯米等一致漲三成光景。北市塲白粳及薄稻軋漲三千八百至三千元。二市到貨六千六百六十石。</p>

<h3>Acting President Li Flies Back to the Capital; Important Consultations with Key Figures Expected; Sun Ke and Cheng Qian Will Come Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Acting President Li, from the 20th to the 25th, spent six days successively flying to Guangzhou, Guilin, Changsha, and Hankou for inspection tours. He has completed his first southern tour since taking office and returned to Nanjing on a special "Ziqiang" plane from Hankou at 5:10 PM on the 25th. The special plane landed at the airport of the Ming Palace Flight Transport Brigade. Government and military officials in Nanjing, including Tong Guanxian, Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, Xu Yongchang, Bai Chongxi, Gu Zhutong, Hong Lanyou, He Yaozu, Huang Shaozi, Li Dachao, Liu Weizhang, Chen Kewen, Huang Bodu, Ye Gongchao, Ni Jiongcheng, Zhang Shouxian, Zhang Yaoming,  Jie, Huang Zhenwu, Xu Jingzhi, Liu Shiyi, and Zhu Huafeng, totaling several dozen, all came to the airport to welcome him. The special plane landed at 5:10 PM. Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Zhizhong, and others greeted him at the aircraft door. After Acting President Li alighted from the plane, he first shook hands with Wu Tiecheng, saying, "You've come!" Then, he shook hands with each of the welcomers to express his regards. At that time, He Yingqin was squeezed to the side by the welcoming crowd, and a certain follower immediately informed Acting President Li, "Respectful Duke [He Yingqin] is here!" Acting President Li then stepped forward to shake hands with He, calling out, "Respectful Duke! Respectful Duke!" Bai Chongxi and Wu Zhongxin both came to welcome him despite their illnesses. When Acting President Li shook hands with Bai, Bai hurriedly placed his cane aside. The airport was filled with enthusiastic scenes. Acting President Li was wearing a Western suit and a black overcoat. Although he was tired from several days of travel, he was still in high spirits. He then took a car back to his official residence at Chuanhougang to rest. Gan Jiehou, Qiu Changwei, Huang Yuncun, Cheng Siyuan, Li Yuqing, and others who accompanied Acting President Li on his tour, also returned to Nanjing on the same plane. Legislative member Zhang Yongcheng also came along from Guilin.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The important consultations among central and local officials, which are about to be held in the capital, may begin within two or three days due to Acting President Li's return to Nanjing on the 25th. Official sources no longer deny these consultations, but say that this is not a gathering, but rather a discussion. The content of the discussion will be the current general situation and the issue of peace talks with the Chinese Communists. Although the source was unwilling to reveal whether internal unity is more important than the decision-making of the current situation in this consultation, the fact proves that in this discussion, the opinions of the central government and local governments will be completely unified to make further efforts for the dawn of peace. Acting President Li's southern tour of the four provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, exchanging opinions with local leaders and local figures, has achieved good results in unifying opinions. This trip can also be regarded as a prelude to the important consultations in the capital. After Acting President Li and President Sun Ke had several long talks in Guangzhou, their wills were completely unified. It is reported that the key officials participating in this consultation will include He Yingqin and Wu Tiecheng in Nanjing. Xu Yongchang, Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, and Gu Zhutong, Bai Chongxi, who came to Nanjing from Hankou, Zhang Zhizhong, who came to Nanjing from the Northwest, and the heads of the Executive Yuan, Cheng Qian, who is about to come to Nanjing from Hunan, and Zhang Qun, who is about to come to Nanjing from Chongqing. If Shao Lizi, Yan Huiqing, and others who went to Beiping at that time have returned south, they will also be invited to participate. However, because this consultation is not a gathering, it may start soon after Sun Ke arrives in Nanjing from Guangzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Cheng Qian, Director of the Changsha Pacification Headquarters, will come to Nanjing from Hunan within two or three days. This was the decision made when Acting President Li invited Cheng during his visit to Changsha. Acting President Li invited Cheng to come to Nanjing to participate in a meeting to discuss the current general situation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] After returning to Nanjing, Wu Tiecheng met with He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, Bai Chongxi, and others on the 25th. Minister of Interior Hong Lanyou also visited He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, and others on the morning of the 25th.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li and President Sun; Discord Not a Fact; Huang Xuecun's Interview with Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] After returning to Nanjing, Huang Xuecun, spokesman for Acting President Li and Director of the Second Bureau of the Presidential Office, met with reporters and said: Acting President Li's southern tour successively inspected Guangzhou, Guilin, Changsha, and Hankou, and the results were very satisfactory. The heads of local governments and people from all walks of life unanimously expressed their support for the government's peace policy. Acting President Li exchanged opinions with President Sun several times in Guangzhou. President Sun has expressed that he will come to Nanjing soon. The rumor that Acting President Li and the president have not fully reconciled their opinions has been proven to be untrue. Acting President Li's invitation to important leaders from various places, such as Zhang Zhizhong and Cheng Qian, to come to Nanjing is only to exchange views on the current general situation, and there is no meeting in a specific form. When a reporter asked whether the National Assembly representatives in Guilin had written to Acting President Li requesting that he fully exercise his powers, Huang replied: Changsha and Hankou also expressed the same thing. The reporter asked: Acting President Li announced the cancellation of martial law in the non-war zone, but has not been implemented in various places? Huang replied: Guangzhou, Guilin, Weisha and other places are still under martial law. He did not inquire in detail whether Hankou is still under martial law because he did not stay in Hankou for a long time. A reporter asked: A Guangzhou dispatch in a Shanghai newspaper reported that Acting President Li instructed the National Assembly representatives in Guangzhou, saying: "If the Communist army crosses the river, we will fight to the end." Is this true? Huang said: He has not heard Acting President Li say this. When reporters asked about Shao Lizi's report, the progress of peace talks, and whether the issues of releasing Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng had been resolved, Huang replied, "I have been away from Nanjing for a few days and do not have any information yet."</p>
<h3>At a Reception for Wuhan's Various Circles; Acting President Li's Sincere Speech; Explaining the True Meaning of Peace; Pointing out Three Key Points for Reforming Politics</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 25th] Acting President Li arrived in Hankou from Hunan today for an inspection tour. Gan Jiehou, Yin Changwei, Huang Xuecun, Cheng Siyuan, Wei Yongcheng, and others came with him. Previously, the Acting President's special plane was originally scheduled to arrive at 9:00 AM today. More than 200 heads of agencies and organizations in Wuhan rushed to the airport on time to greet him. After waiting for more than three hours, they suddenly heard the rattling sound of the plane in the southwest sky, and the welcoming personnel were very excited. At 12:10 PM, the "Ziqiang" special plane slowly landed at the airport. Li alighted from the plane amidst the melodious sound of military music. First, three female students from St. Louis Girls' School presented flowers on behalf of the citizens of Wuhan to pay their respects. After inspecting the guard of honor, Li was accompanied by Xu Zuyi and Li Pinxian, the deputy commanders-in-chief of the suppression headquarters, and entered the city by car. Citizens lined the streets to welcome him, vying to see his demeanor. Applause and firecrackers resounded incessantly. The Acting President frequently waved his hat to signal to the citizens, showing warmth and kindness. After about an hour, he arrived at the official residence of the suppression headquarters to rest and have lunch. In addition to the senior generals of the suppression headquarters, Zhang Xielun, Zhu Dingxiang, Xia Wei, Yan Xunfu, and other administrative heads were also present. He inquired in detail about the local situation during the meal. At 2:10 PM, the Acting President held a tea party at the Deming Hotel to entertain all sectors of Wuhan and gave an impromptu speech. Li first said: Today, all mankind in the world expects peace and construction, and the elimination of war. The Chinese people have suffered the most from the disasters of war and are most eager for peace. He firmly believes that this kind of popular aspiration cannot be violated by anyone, and the wish for peace will be successfully achieved. Li believes that the few stubborn elements who have not yet understood the true meaning of peace should be guided and corrected. It is said: "Looking at Chinese and foreign history, any political group that is superstitious about force and alienated from the people will inevitably fall into disintegration. We must accept the bloody lessons, admit the reasons for failure, and work together for peaceful nation-building. I deeply feel the arduous responsibility, but I am determined to go through fire and water. All difficulties and dangers are not what I personally worry about. Whether peaceful construction will succeed in the future depends entirely on whether the people of the whole country sincerely urge it." When discussing political reform, Li suggested three points: (1) In order to relieve the people's suffering, on the one hand, we must take into account people's livelihood and stabilize the economy, and on the other hand, we must respect freedom of speech and action, and eliminate the spiritual shackles of the people, in order to enter the democratic path. (2) To reform politics, we must first rectify discipline, eliminate corruption, change all decadent practices, and thoroughly seek benefits for the people. (3) The current urgent task is to abolish redundant agencies, eliminate the long-standing malpractices of buck-passing and constraints, and adopt the principle of streamlined troops, adjust the military system, so as to save the national treasury and reduce the burden on the people. At this point, Li reiterated that this political reform and the effort for peace are the consistent demands of the whole country, and he earnestly hopes that everyone will unite their strength and move forward together. Everyone responded with warm applause. Finally, Li Jincheng, a senior figure in Hubei Province, gave a speech, saying that the points indicated by the Acting President were not much different from what he saw in the Communist area. If he can continue to work hard for peace, the future is very promising. At 3:20 PM, the Acting President and his party left Hankou and flew to Nanjing amidst the cheers of the crowd. The heads of all agencies went to the airport to see him off. According to reports, Li stayed in Hankou for only three hours, and rarely came into contact with the outside world in a hurry.</p>
<h3>Hunan's Various Circles Welcome the Meeting Chairman's Four Requests</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 25th] The welcome meeting for Acting President Li was held by various circles in Hunan at 9:00 AM on the 25th. After Li gave a speech, Tang Boqiu, speaker of the Hunan Provincial Assembly, made two points to the president: (1) Strictly rectify discipline and reform politics; (2) Take into account the suffering of the people and stabilize people's livelihood. Based on these two points, the following requests were made to the acting president: (1) Please the president overcome all difficulties and thoroughly implement the seven peace measures: (2) In the past, the central government adopted a policy of exploitation of local finances. After the currency reform, the people of Hunan exchanged their blood and sweat for gold yuan coupons. As a result, the central government even transported the gold from the Changsha Central Bank, losing 30 million people's hearts with 30,000 taels of gold, which was very unwise. Please, the president, immediately order the head office of the Central Bank to return it. (3) There are hundreds of malpractices in conscription of soldiers and grain, which the president knows very well. I hope the president will immediately stop conscripting soldiers and grain. (4) In the past, the National Resources Commission's control of Hunan's special minerals was too unreasonable. Please order to lift it immediately. After the meeting, they went to the airport. They took off to Hankou at 11:00 AM. Chairman Cheng was unable to go on the same plane because he had official duties to deal with.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 25th] Acting President Li visited Hunan and stayed here for a total of 21 hours and 5 minutes, leaving the people of Hunan with the most profound impression of democracy, enlightenment, enthusiasm, determination to seek peace, and determination to reform politics.</p>
<h3>Yan Shao and Others May Return South Today; It Is Said That They Have Agreed on Specific Measures for Negotiations with Mao Zedong; The Communist Side Agrees to Restore Traffic and Postal Services between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 25th] According to an unverified report on the 25th: Shao Lizi, a government peace talk representative, and Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communists, have agreed on specific measures for starting Kuomintang-Communist negotiations.</p>
<p>It is reported that Shao Lizi and Jiang Yong jointly sent a telegram here saying: The Chinese Communists have agreed to restore traffic and postal services between the Kuomintang and Communist regions.

<p>Formal peace talks may begin after Shao Lizi returns to Nanjing to report on the trip to Acting President Li. The period is not far away. It is said that Shao Lizi and the Shanghai Peace Delegation, Yan Huiqing and others, are expected to return south on the 26th.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Acting President Li's return from the south will feel that the hope of peace talks is higher than at any time since he took office.

<p>In Liu's long letter, his criticism of Sun Ke was quite fierce, and he also made a special historical analysis of the decline of the Kuomintang.

He said: For many years, corruption and corruption have long existed among a few wealthy and rich officials, who were all paupers before the 16th year of the Republic of China.

<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, 25th] After the announcement of the financial and economic reform plan, the Hangzhou market's reaction was initially a rise followed by a fall. The rise in commodity prices was astonishing, with rice soaring to 13,000 (currency unit). By evening, the gold market had fallen to 142,000 (currency unit), and "Big Head" silver dollars to 1,600 yuan.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, 25th] Today's market situation fluctuated greatly. Flour reached a new peak: Early rice 12,420 yuan, late rice 12,300 yuan, wheat 13,500 yuan, white wheat 14,500 yuan, flour 5,470 yuan, soybean oil 65,000 yuan, cotton yarn 4,200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, 25th] As soon as the new economic plan was announced, people became restless, and commodity prices became strong. It was then heard that a large amount of supplies were being sold off in the Shanghai market, and prices gradually declined again. High-quality white rice was traded at 13,700 yuan in the morning, coarse rice at 11,500 yuan, flour at 5,500 yuan, wheat at 15,500 yuan, and "Tianguan" cotton yarn at 460,000 yuan for immediate payment. In the afternoon, the price for cash payment fell to 410,000 yuan. Furthermore, the Social Affairs Department of the County Government, considering the soaring commodity prices today, suspected that unscrupulous merchants were creating trouble. They, together with the police bureau, inspected the membership certificates at the flour market in the Pinfang Teahouse in the Xuanmiao Temple. As a result, more than 60 people were found to have no certificates. After being taken back to the county government for interrogation, they were all released. The county government is currently drafting market management regulations to strictly manage market transactions in various industries and prevent speculation and manipulation.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, 25th] Amid the financial and economic reform, commodity prices in Zhenjiang suddenly jumped wildly. Gold for sale was 14,400 (currency unit), and for purchase was 13,000 yuan. Top-quality cooked rice was 12,000 yuan, medium-quality was 11,000. Jinshan flour was recorded at 5,900, and white paper at 14,000 per ream. Other cotton yarn and foreign goods rose by varying degrees, from 20% to 30%.</p>
<p>Nanchang</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, 25th] On the eve of the announcement of the new economic and financial reform plan, the market here was already fluctuating, and today it is even more chaotic. More than a hundred silver dollar vendors were imprisoned, but the value of the silver dollar remains high. The "Big Head" silver dollar was quoted at 1,600 in the afternoon, a sharp increase of 400 compared to yesterday. High-quality early rice was traded at 7,200 at the retail outlets, an increase of 2,000. Gold for sale was quoted at 155,000, an increase of 30,000. Regarding this volatile market, this reporter visited responsible officials, who all stated that they were awaiting orders to handle it. According to Yang Ming, the Director of Finance and concurrently Secretary-General, the chaos in today's market is largely due to human factors. He stated that the local finances have not yet been studied in detail, but self-sufficiency is already insufficient and will become even more difficult in the future. According to observations by people in the economic field, this kind of volatility is expected to stabilize after a certain period.</p>
<p>Changsha</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, 25th] After the announcement of the financial and economic reform plan, the Changsha market experienced a surge in prices because the commodity tax on goods such as cotton yarn and matches was changed to collection in kind, and items such as oil, salt, silk, and cloth were mutually marked up. This reporter recently visited economic experts such as Hou Houpei, inquiring about their opinions on this measure. They all believed that this was not a formal "reform plan" but rather a "transitional" method of "helping the poor." Whether it can achieve practical results depends on whether silver dollars can be cast in large quantities and quickly enter circulation. If only the sound of stairs is heard but no one comes down, the devaluation of the gold yuan notes will be even more concerning than in the past.</p>
<p>Guangzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, 25th] After the announcement of the new economic plan, the market here was extremely volatile. The Hong Kong dollar rose and fell sharply, reaching a high of 455 and then falling back to between 410 and 420.

<p>Chengdu</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, 25th] Today, the financial and economic reform has caused a good reaction in the Chengdu market. Commodity price fluctuations are slight, and gold and silver transactions have become more active after being conducted openly. The issuance of Sichuan local currency will be shelved, and the provincial bank's subsidiary currency will be issued in various counties.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Critique of the New Financial and Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>The financial and economic reform plan, which has attracted nationwide attention, was passed by the Executive Yuan Council on the 23rd and immediately promulgated and implemented yesterday by Acting President Li using the "emergency clause" of the Constitution. This is another reform of our country's currency system, which is of utmost importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and naturally deserves our attention. Especially today, when prices are soaring and people are struggling to make a living, whether this new financial and economic reform plan can stabilize the financial situation, curb prices, and rescue the people from their suffering is of even greater concern to the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>It has only been six or seven months since our country reformed its currency system last August, and the value of the gold yuan note is quickly catching up with the old legal tender! We believe that the reasons for the current economic crisis are no more than the following three: (1) the ongoing domestic war has led to huge financial expenditures and an unbalanced national budget; (2) the continued expansion of the gold yuan note has caused gold, banknotes, and silver dollars with financial attributes to drive up commodity prices; (3) the inability to balance foreign trade, with export trade stagnating and foreign goods pouring in, creating an unprecedented trade deficit. Therefore, the new financial and economic reform plan adopted by the government this time is naturally aimed at these three drawbacks. However, whether it can be effective seems to be too early to be optimistic.</p>
<p>First, regarding the financial aspect, the new plan adopts the following measures: (1) A comprehensive estimate will be made of the materials and funds needed for military affairs this year, and realistic and reliable plans and preparations will be made in advance. (2) A budget will be compiled in accordance with this year's policy guidelines, so that all expenditures will be within a certain scope, and there will be no additional budget increases. (3) The financial revenue and expenditure system will be revised, and land tax will be entirely attributed to local governments, so that the provinces and cities will no longer rely on subsidies from the national treasury. (4) The requisitioning of grain will be stopped. (5) Customs import duties will be calculated and paid in customs gold units. (6) Commodity tax will be collected in kind according to the tax rate. (7) Salt tax will be handled in the same way as commodity tax. (8) For business income tax that is directly paid to the central government, a method of apportioning and contracting payment among industries may be adopted. On the surface, these measures seem to be very practical and easy to implement, and it is not difficult to achieve the ideal of balancing the state's financial revenue and expenditure. However, based on actual conditions, these eight measures can be summarized in one sentence: they are still no more than the four words "increase revenue and reduce expenditure." We do not need to talk about theory, but only consider the current actual situation. Whether the financial measures in the new plan can be fully effective is still a question. To be honest, in today's situation where the war or peace is undecided and the situation is becoming increasingly serious, no one can make an accurate estimate of the military needs and government expenses, and no one can guarantee that the government will not propose additional budgets after compiling the budget. Even if expenditure is to be reduced, it is still impossible without the government having a decisive determination to wield the axe and not be afraid of offending people. Secondly, the government wants to increase revenue, customs duties are paid in customs gold units, taxes are collected in kind, and in order to reduce subsidies to local governments, local tax collection restrictions are specially relaxed. Whether these measures can increase government revenue and achieve the ideal of financial balance is also a question.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the monetary system, the important measures stipulated in the new plan are three: (1) People are allowed to buy and sell gold and silver, and the Central Bank may also buy and sell gold and silver. (2) Silver dollars are allowed to circulate, and the government may raise funds to purchase silver and mint silver dollars. (3) Foreign currencies are still prohibited from circulating, and the Central Bank will exchange foreign currencies according to the gold price and foreign exchange certificate price. These three measures can be said to be the "restoration" measures of our government's financial measures. When reforming the currency system, people were not allowed to hold them, and they were not allowed to buy and sell them. They were only allowed to exchange them with the government. Not long after, the original intention was changed, and people were allowed to hold them, and the National Bank handled the gold and silver deposit and exchange method. Not long after, the deposit and exchange method was stopped. Now, the cable is tied up with allowing people to freely buy and sell, and walking back to the old road from which it originally started. This "restoration" policy of returning to the original point is a unique invention of the Chinese government. In terms of actual effectiveness, whether the new plan can achieve the effect of "stabilizing the financial situation" still depends on whether the financial authorities have the determination to continuously sell large amounts of gold and silver. If the government is still greedy for petty profits as in the past, and always wants to compete with the people for profits, and when the gold reserves gradually decrease, it is unwilling to sell them, or even wants to recover them for the state, then not only will the financial situation not be stabilized, but it will also increase the crisis of financial and economic turmoil due to repeated reversals!</p>
<p>Thirdly, regarding import and export trade, there are no novel measures except for the opening up of self-provided foreign exchange. If this is all there is to it, and it cannot do its best to promote export trade, then seeking a balance of import and export trade will still be empty!</p>
<p>However, having said that, this new financial and economic reform plan, although it is still treating the head when the head hurts and treating the feet when the feet hurt, is still a way out of no way. As long as the financial authorities are determined to stabilize the financial situation, are willing to speak honestly and do honestly, and can use the spirit of wielding the axe, on the one hand, selling large amounts of gold and silver to withdraw gold yuan notes, and on the other hand, immediately stopping the printing of gold yuan notes and no longer resorting to the issuance of paper money, then both measures will be taken simultaneously, and the turbulent situation of the financial economy will naturally be calmed down.</p>
<h3>Lapham to Meet Hoffman; Decision to Submit Aid to China Report to the U.S. Congress; Economic Cooperation Administration to Purchase Tin from Us</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 24th] John Lapham, head of the China Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration, told reporters on the 24th that he intends to stay here for several weeks. While here, he will consult with Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman and other Economic Cooperation Administration officials and assist the Economic Cooperation Administration in submitting a report to Congress on further economic aid to China.</p>
<p>Hoffman recently told reporters that the Economic Cooperation Administration may not need to request additional aid to China funds before the end of the current fiscal year on June 30. The Economic Cooperation Administration's economic aid to China program was approved by Congress last year to continue until April 1949. However, approximately $80 million of the $275 million appropriation for economic aid to China remains unused.</p>
<p>Hoffman stated that the Economic Cooperation Administration will request Congress to extend the economic aid to China program to the end of June, using the remaining funds for assistance. Most of these remaining funds are left over from the Economic Cooperation Administration's suspension of a $70 million power construction and reconstruction plan for China due to the unstable situation in China. Some materials originally intended to be shipped to North China have also been declared suspended.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 24th] New approval of rehabilitation expenditures announced by the Economic Cooperation Administration today includes the purchase of materials from China and the Philippines. One is to approve the purchase of tin and tin-based alloys worth $300,000 from the British and American occupation zones of Germany to China. The other is to purchase plant fiber products worth $355,000 from the Philippines, also for use in the British and American occupation zones of Germany.</p>
<h3>Three Medical Training Teams to Come to China from the United States to Work</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] The United Medical Aid to China Association decided at its meeting tonight to stipulate in the 1949 budget to fund three medical training teams to China. If circumstances permit, they will depart for China this year. The team members will be selected from American medical experts, and teachers from Chinese medical schools will be "trainees." According to Association President Ge Legesheng, one of the courses taught will be radiology. The United Relief Organization previously donated hundreds of electric light machines to China, but most of them are now discarded and unused due to the lack of experts to operate them and technicians to repair them, which is a pity.</p>
<h3>American Merchants Are Conducting Trade Between the Communist Areas and Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] According to United Press sources, negotiations on the commencement of private trade between China and Japan are underway. Mr. Li, the Chinese manager of the American-registered Arblebber Lee Import and Export Company, said that he has been discussing with foreign trade officials of the Allied Headquarters the exchange of soybeans from North China and Northeast China for Japanese goods. US officials have confirmed that they are considering this proposal, but have not indicated whether they will allow Japan to have economic relations with the Communist regime. It is generally believed that this proposal requires a policy decision from Washington. Mr. Li's company is conducting this through its Hong Kong branch, which is still maintaining offices in North China and Northeast China. The company will act as an intermediary in the proposed barter trade. Japan will not directly conduct business with the Communist government and North Chinese merchants.</p>

<h3>News from the Finnish Capital: Soviet Union Increases Troops on Arctic Border, Intention Possibly to Intimidate Norway</h3>
<p>[United Press Helsinki, 25th] Well-informed sources said today that the Soviet Union has been increasing its troop deployments near the northern border with Norway, augmenting its military strength in the area. These troops have been dispatched from the Murmansk Military District, the number of which is unclear. The troop movements began last week and are clearly related to Norway's intention to join the North Atlantic defense treaty. There is no indication yet whether Soviet forces will take similar action on the Finnish border. It is noted that the Soviet Union recently proposed a five-year non-aggression treaty to Norway, which Norway not only rejected but also is preparing to join the North Atlantic Treaty, which the Soviet Union detests.</p>
<p>[United Press Oslo, 25th] Norway's military hub, the "North Cape," is the gateway for the Soviet Union into the Atlantic Ocean, and the Soviet Union could occupy it with a battalion of troops at any time. The area is near the Soviet Arctic border and currently has no protection. At the same time, northern Norway's defenses are weak and vulnerable to attack. Although the Norwegian Communist Party's influence is not large, it is excellent at engaging in internal sabotage. Norway's border with the Soviet Union is 132 miles long, and its border with Finland is 450 miles long. The importance of the North Cape's position is equal to the Soviet Union's Mediterranean throat, the Dardanelles Strait, and the North Sea throat, the Skagerrak. Soviet military officers are familiar with the area's geography. In 1944, Soviet forces pursued German troops, penetrating a hundred miles into Norway. Norwegian officials admit that Norwegian forces in the north are not sufficient to resist the Soviet army. Norway's more solid defense line is at the port of Narvik.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Oslo, 25th] A Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman recently stated that reports from Helsinki about the Soviet Union strengthening its defense forces on the Soviet-Norwegian border are inaccurate. He said that the Foreign Ministry had not received this information.</p>

<p>[This newspaper report] New York, 25th broadcast: Brussels news, Churchill declared today amid cheers that he predicts that this European Unity Movement Conference in Brussels will surely produce a European Federation working for peace. Churchill strongly stated that the idea of making Europe a united whole is in line with the needs of the vast majority of people throughout the European continent.</p>
<p>[United Press Brussels, 25th] The International Conference of the European Unity Movement opened today at the Belgian Academy. The initiator, British Conservative Party leader Churchill, and the Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak will both deliver speeches. A chairman will also be elected at the meeting, and French Socialist Party leader Guy Mollet is expected to be elected. The meeting will draft a comprehensive European policy, stipulate the goals of the unity movement, and plan to establish a European Supreme Court to implement the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Approximately 150 representatives from 21 countries are attending, including the UK, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Greece, Turkey, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and West Germany. In terms of exiled countries, Spain, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia are also participating. The so-called European Unity Movement was initiated by independent groups in various European countries with the aim of organizing a European Federation along the lines of the American Federation. The leaders of the unity movement are Churchill, Spaak, Italian Prime Minister Gasperi, former French Prime Minister Blum, and Churchill's son-in-law, Sandys. A preparatory meeting was held in The Hague last May, and after the Western European Union Council of Five agreed to establish the European Committee and Consultative Assembly last month, the European Unity Movement became even more enthusiastic.</p>

<p>[This newspaper report] New York, 25th broadcast: Canberra news: Australian Foreign Minister Evatt departed for New Delhi today and will meet with Nehru to discuss the situation in Burma and other issues. The Indian government has also invited representatives from Pakistan and Ceylon to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Bombay, 24th] The Indian Communist Party issued a statement tonight saying that the government's widespread arrest of communists is nothing more than a fascist attack on the rights of labor and trade unions. Prime Minister Nehru's and Deputy Prime Minister Patel's anti-communist movement is aimed at negotiating loans with the United States and assuming the leadership of the Asian group under the wings of imperialism. The statement urged millions of railway workers to stage a general strike on March 9th to protest. It continued that India is preparing to openly and shamelessly occupy a position in the so-called Pacific Pact, a copy of the North Atlantic Treaty, and to join the Anglo-American military alliance to wage an imperialist war against the Soviet Union and democratic China.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Accuses Asian Conference of Being an Anti-Communist Bloc</h3>
<p>Indian Ambassador to Soviet Union Calls it Absurd</p>
<p>[Associated Press Moscow, 24th] The Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mrs. Pandit, told the Associated Press on the 24th that "the Soviet Union continues to misinterpret the purpose of the Southeast Asian conference, constantly accusing India of forming some kind of secret alliance with imperialist countries." The Soviet press has pointed out two points: (1) Indian President Nehru convened this conference "to form a resistance group against communist activities in Asia"; (2) India is a "loyal pawn of Britain and the United States." Mrs. Pandit denied this, saying that the Asian conference was convened for the specific purpose of liberating Indonesia from the Netherlands. "It is absurd to say that India is a tool of anyone. India has always advocated protecting the freedom of Asia and preventing all colonial rule."</p>

<h3>Truman Prepares to Make Campaign Speech: Battles Staunch Political Opponents, Clears Obstacles to Implementing Social Welfare Plans</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 24th] President Truman said on the 24th that he is preparing to travel the country in the near future to present his legislative program to the people because the program is facing strong opposition from "staunch reactionaries." President Truman spoke to the nation from Washington on Jefferson Memorial Day, saying that although the Democratic Party won in November, "We are encountering determined opposition, and special interests are fighting against us, just as they did before November 3rd." The President's speech was broadcast nationwide and by radio facsimile. He said in a fighting tone that after reviewing the Republican Party's opposition to the communist legislative program, "I plan to travel the country again by train to tell the people how their government is progressing." Truman condemned the Republican Party's "one-sided propaganda," and he attacked the Republican Party's opposition to legislative programs on labor, housing, and increasing the minimum wage.</p>
<h3>Syngman Rhee Opposes Unification of North and South Korea</h3>
<p>Delivers Speech Criticizing Communism</p>
<p>[United Press Seoul, 25th] South Korean President Syngman Rhee delivered a speech today criticizing communism. He said that the communist plague is spreading cruelly and resolutely in every human society, and every person in every country must resist it. Unless they resist the Communist Party, they cannot contain communism. Rhee's remarks likely emphasized his opposition to any proposal for South and North Korea to form a unified government. The United Nations Mediation Commission is currently studying the possibility of Korean unification. According to Pyongyang Radio, North Korean Premier Kim Il-sung recently went to Moscow for a meeting with Soviet Ambassador Shirkov.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Expels Anna Louise Strong: A Warning to the Chinese Communist Party</h3>
<p>Views of American Journalist Walter</p>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington, 23rd] Paul Walter of the Baltimore Sun's Washington office wrote in the Sun today that it is believed here that the Soviet Union's arrest and expulsion of Ms. Strong is a warning from the Soviet Union to the Chinese Communist Party, telling the CCP to stay within bounds. Walter said: People who specialize in analyzing Stalin's strategies have put forward a theory here today that the Soviet government's expulsion of an American woman on the grounds of "espionage" may be of far-reaching importance. They believe that the arrest and expulsion of Strong is not just an attempt to conduct anti-American propaganda, but an action aimed at tightening Stalin's control over Manchuria and the areas further south in China occupied by the communist-led troops. According to their assumption, the Soviet Union's intention in this action is to give the leaders of the CCP army, Mao Zedong, a strong hint not to overstep the boundaries like Tito of Yugoslavia. They pointed out that Ms. Strong, in her writing, enthusiastically supported Mao Zedong. Before last July, she had been a guest of Mao Zedong, where she spent twelve months. She was arrested a week ago when she tried to obtain permission from the Soviet Foreign Ministry to meet with Mao Zedong again.</p>
<h3>US Federal High Court to Hear Anna Louise Strong's Statement</h3>

<p>[Associated Press New York, 24th] The Federal High Court, which is investigating communist spies, has scheduled a special meeting on the 25th to hear the testimony of Ms. Strong, a pro-Soviet female writer who was expelled by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 24th] Strong reportedly said on the plane: "I had a little trouble with the Soviet government. I originally intended to take the Trans-Siberian Railway to China. The Soviet Union didn't want to open this route. I don't know why."</p>
<h3>UN Security Council Membership Committee Passes Resolution: Approving South Korea's Membership, Soviet Union Will Exercise Veto Power During Security Council Vote</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Lake Success, 24th] The United Nations Membership Committee voted 8 to 2 on the 24th to recommend to the Security Council that the Republic of Korea government, supported by the United States in Seoul, be allowed to join the organization. The two opposing votes were cast by the Soviet Union and Ukraine. The Soviet Union's firm opposition reinforces the general belief that the Soviet Union will use its third veto when this issue is finally considered in the Security Council. The Seoul government's application has been supported by Argentina, Canada, China, Cuba, France, Norway, and the United Kingdom and the United States. The Soviet Union attacked the Seoul government as a "colonial puppet," and Ukraine supported it.</p>

<h3>US Presents Outline of Plan to Assist Backward Countries to UN Economic and Social Council: Requests Development of Plan for Discussion</h3>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 25th] US Representative Messersmith presented today to the United Nations Economic and Social Council the outline of President Truman's plan to develop economically backward countries, requesting United Nations cooperation. The plan did not mention the amount of investment that the United States might make. It only proposed that the United Nations and its specialized agencies formulate concrete plans for the Economic and Social Council to discuss at its summer meeting. Messersmith said that it would take decades to improve the economies of various countries. The lives of tens of millions of people can only be gradually improved, but if the United Nations agencies can cooperate in a cunning manner, they may greatly accelerate economic development. This plan promotes the investment of private capital in necessary areas under appropriate protection. Unlike the old-fashioned imperialism that seeks to exploit foreign interests, this plan is different.</p>

<h3>Remarks by French Communist Leader Cause Great Uproar: Parliament Passes Resolution Condemning Him, Army Minister Accuses French Communist Party of Inciting Mutiny</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Paris, 25th] The French National Assembly formally condemned Communist leader Thorez on the 25th because he had publicly declared twice within 48 hours that the French people would welcome Soviet troops in the event of a third world war. In a lengthy and indignant meeting, the parliament passed a resolution stating that Thorez's remarks were "an insult to French patriots" and expressed confidence in the government's declaration that it would protect national independence by law. The above resolution passed by a vote of 386 to 182, with only the Communist Party voting against it.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 25th] Senior government officials said today that Army Minister Ramadier had taken legal action against the Central Committee of the French Communist Party for inciting mutiny in the army. Ramadier's complaint was sent to Justice Minister Lecourt, who will order prosecutors to indict non-parliamentary Communist Party executive members. It is noted that Communist Secretary-General Thorez reiterated in Congress yesterday that the French should welcome the Red Army if it entered France, causing government opposition. The government plans to seize the immunity of Members of Parliament such as Thorez and Cachin, the editor-in-chief of the Communist Party's organ, "L'Humanité," in order to arrest them.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 24th] According to the "Evening Standard" tonight, which reprinted an article from "World Review," "The British King's condition is, in the current state of medical knowledge, untreatable, so well-informed sources believe that the British King must gradually relinquish his duties to prevent his illness from making him unbearable."

"From a political point of view, Lord Mountbatten is the most important member of the entire royal family."</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Insein Rail Yard, 10 Miles North of Rangoon</h3>
<p>Sounds of Artillery Shake City of Rangoon</p>
<p>[United Press Rangoon, 25th] A fierce battle took place today at the Insein railway yard, ten miles north of Rangoon. According to pro-government reports, the Karen ethnic group continues to flee to avoid being severely attacked by government forces. Officials announced that government forces killed 50 communists 70 miles west of Rangoon in Bassein, but the communist riots and the Karen rebellion are clearly unrelated.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Rangoon has become a front line today. Armed guards patrol the streets day and night or are stationed outside government offices. Military vehicles heading north are endless. For a week, refugees from Insein and the suburbs have been taking vehicles or walking along the road, with dirty faces and disheveled hair, carrying only one bundle of luggage, pouring into Rangoon. After nightfall, all that can be seen is the red light in the north illuminating the sky, and the sounds of artillery and machine guns shake the city. Food prices are soaring endlessly. The city lacks water, which is insufficient to meet needs, and the Karen rebels have cut off its main water source.</p>

<h3>Implementing Plans to Curb Speculation: National Bank to Massively Sell Commodities Today. Silver Dollar Reserves Sufficient to Control the Market; Xu Kan Scheduled to Fly to Shanghai Today to Announce Implementation Details of the Plan.</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Finance Minister Xu Kan and National Bank President Liu Gongyun are scheduled to arrive in the city this afternoon from Germany. They will immediately convene a meeting with financial and industrial leaders in the city to distribute the implementation details of the new economic plan. The National Bank's sale of gold and tightening of credit yesterday can be interpreted as preparations before the implementation of the new plan. Yesterday afternoon, daily interbank lending rates had already risen to 45 and 50 yuan. Today, there are sugar and yarn loans exceeding ten billion, and bank branches have differing levels of reserves, further tightening credit. It is generally speculated that the National Bank will massively sell precious metals and commodities today, fully cracking down on speculation and normalizing the market, so as to promote the reform plan.</p>
<p>Regarding the prospects for the implementation of the new economic plan, it is generally believed that the basic elements for success are balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure and ceasing inflationary issuances. Another essential factor is the National Bank's silver dollar reserves, which must be sufficient to control the market and maintain currency credibility in the long term. Regarding the National Bank's silver dollar reserves, there are three estimates: 50 million, 70 million, and 100 million coins. Although the exact number cannot be confirmed, its strong financial strength is beyond doubt. In the future, the National Bank will inevitably stipulate and maintain a ratio between silver dollars and gold yuan, and whether the ratio is flexible or fixed will depend on the National Bank's policy and whether industry and commerce can bear their expenses under long-term price stability. Furthermore, general observers agree that prices are unlikely to fluctuate greatly in the short term.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Since the announcement of the financial reform plan, specific decisions on financial technology issues related to the Shanghai market in the future must await the return of National Bank President Liu Gongyun to Shanghai. It is reported that Mr. Liu will return to Shanghai from Guangzhou today.</p>
<h3>New Plan Announced: Gold Market Active; Speculation Runs Rampant, Everyone Rushing In; Each Firm Trading 1,000 to 2,000 Bars; Gold Shops Meet to Discuss Resumption of Business.</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] In the new financial reform plan, the free trading of gold and silver has been opened. The long-dormant gold and silver market in the city has become active again since yesterday. Gold trading in the money exchange shops on Sichuan Road and the securities firms in the Securities Building was lively again yesterday morning. Speculators who generally operate in the stock market or commodity market have shifted their targets to the gold market, creating a rush, and transactions in each gold shop have tripled. According to reliable estimates, the average transaction volume of gold in major gold shops yesterday was about 1,000 to 2,000 bars per shop. In the future, gold market transactions will generally be settled on the same day between 9:30 AM and 12:30 PM. From 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM, settlements will be extended to the next morning.</p>
<p>Buying and Selling Prices Widely Divergent</p>
<p>According to observations from those in the gold industry, after the resumption of open trading of gold and silver yesterday, general market prices relied solely on quotes from a few large gold shops. When transactions were busy, the buying and selling prices of small gold shops could diverge by about 100,000 yuan per ten taels, while the closing prices diverged by only 20,000 yuan. The excessive discrepancy in market prices makes it necessary to restore centralized market trading. Therefore, several gold shops with a long history maintain a reserved attitude and remain closed, awaiting the authorities to fully disclose the new plan before deciding on a new direction for resuming business.</p>
<p>Most Hong Kong Ingots Refused</p>
<p>Furthermore, the gold ingots traded in each gold shop yesterday required a minimum purity of 99%. Those with insufficient purity, except for the factory bars of the Central Bank, were discounted according to the purity marked on the bar. All other "refrigerated goods" were refused. Even six-tael ingots from Hong Kong were mostly refused. This is because there are too many fake Hong Kong ingots, and it is impossible to check the purity of each one during busy transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold jewelry shops in the city held an informal meeting to discuss ways to resume business under the new plan, but no conclusion was reached. It was decided to convene a board meeting today to make a final decision. It is said that the shops may resume listing and trading jewelry as late as next Monday.</p>
<h3>The Sound of Clinking Everywhere; Silver Dollars and Other Currencies See an Uptick; Price Differences Have Narrowed.</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] After the announcement of the financial reform plan, the city's silver dollar market changed its "underground" posture and began to operate openly. The "open-air markets" for silver dollars, which have secretly gathered in Lao Bei Men, Henan Road, Fuzhou Road, Tongfu Road, Xiafei Road, and Race Course Road in recent months, have become even more active since yesterday. In contrast to the police precinct's relaxed Economic Police Team, thousands of silver dollar vendors are trading without scruples, and the situation is unusually enthusiastic. The sound of clinking can be heard almost everywhere in the surrounding bustling areas. Because the general public heard that the prices of goods in stores would soon be denominated in silver dollars, they rushed to the market to buy them. Yesterday, the price of silver dollars could have been raised, but due to widespread rumors that a large number of new and old silver dollars stored in the mint would be released in the coming days, and silver dollar vendors had accumulated loose funds, the result was only that each silver dollar fluctuated between 1,500 and 1,600 gold yuan. "Small heads" such as Dragon Dollars, Eagle Dollars, Ship Dollars, and Sichuan Dollars, which have always been inferior to "Big Heads" (Yuan Shikai dollars) for months, are also being purchased and collected instead of "Yuan Heads" because it is generally believed that their purity and weight are not much different from "Yuan Heads" and that they may be used at the same price under the principle of open circulation in the future. As a result, their prices have gradually risen, and the price differences between various currencies have gradually narrowed. Based on the situation observed throughout the day yesterday, silver dollars may become a common object of value calculation and storage for the general public in the near future, and various businesses engaged in silver dollar trading will spring up like mushrooms after the rain.</p>
<h3>Expert Comments on the Plan: Analyzes Three Advantages, Sufficient to Alleviate the Crisis.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Since the announcement of the financial reform plan, initial reactions have been mixed. General prices fluctuated more in the morning, indicating that various parties did not thoroughly understand the new plan and therefore adopted a wait-and-see attitude. However, prices fell across the board in the afternoon. According to an economic expert's view on the new plan, its advantages are: (1) The circulation of silver dollars can reduce the issuance of gold yuan to curb inflation; (2) Imports and exports can be developed, especially imports can use self-provided foreign exchange to promote trade; (3) Tax payments calculated in customs yuan can increase tax revenue and eliminate the drawbacks of past tax revenue depreciation. Furthermore, according to the analysis of the new plan's content by general personnel, although the plan is not extremely perfect and cannot completely solve the current economic problems, it is a good remedy for alleviating the crisis at present. The most obvious aspect is the development of trade, which can have the effect of invigorating the financial market and bringing floating capital into the right track, so that the market can prosper. If the government can further control materials and adjust them as appropriate, the price hike can be gradually eased and move towards a stable path.</p>
<h3>Shou Jingwei Expresses Hope.</h3>
<p>Avoid Old Ways of Treating Serious Illness with Weak Medicine</p>
<p>After the government announced the financial reform plan, the reporter specifically visited Shou Jingwei, Chairman of the Shanghai Import and Export Business Association, to inquire about his views. According to his statement, the government authorities have a deep understanding of the economic crisis of shrinking production and lack of materials. However, the two fundamental solutions of material adjustment and increased production have not yet been announced. It is expected that concrete plans with the right medicine can be formulated within days to meet the expectations of the import and export industry. At the beginning of his tenure, Finance Minister Xu had proposed a chain system to develop trade, and there were precedents for production and export material loan methods. It is hoped that the government will earnestly use its financial power, and whether it is (1) low-interest production loans or (2) purchase contracts for export material loans, it will be able to avoid the old ways of treating serious illnesses with weak medicine and adapt to the urgent needs of industry and commerce with sufficient funds. Then, in this process where the dawn of peace has appeared, the southeastern and southwestern provinces can still expect to increase production to seek sufficient foreign exchange and stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3>New Customs Yuan Notes to Be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>The government will adopt a customs yuan system for import duties, similar to the past customs gold unit system, with each customs gold yuan pegged to US 40 cents. The Central Bank will be responsible for issuing the customs yuan notes. Importers can purchase customs yuan for application when paying taxes, using gold, silver, foreign currencies, or foreign exchange transfers from the Bank. The new customs yuan notes will be issued soon, and relevant parties have already started preparations. Before the war, customs duties were always paid using the customs gold unit system. Customs gold notes were also used as currency. After the last currency reform, they were abandoned along with legal tender. This time, the new customs gold notes avoid the name of customs gold and are renamed customs yuan, and it is determined that they shall not be circulated in the market except for paying customs duties.</p>
<h3>Open Trading of Gold and Silver; No More Arrests from Now On.</h3>
<p>According to the Financial Management Bureau Director, after the announcement of the new economic plan, gold, silver, and silver dollars are allowed to circulate and trade freely. All activities previously entrusted to the police bureau to arrest black market gold and silver merchants and silver dollar vendors have been stopped since yesterday. Starting yesterday, gold, silver, and silver dollars can be freely traded and are no longer considered illegal. However, foreign currencies are not included in this category and are still prohibited from free trading. The bureau's future work will still focus on inspecting bank operations. Whether to abolish the bureau must await instructions from the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Evacuation of Prisoners Comes to an End</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Prison's evacuation of prisoners has now come to an end. Most of those who meet the evacuation regulations have been released. Currently, only a few prisoners have not been released. The prison authorities stated that they will be released as soon as they find reliable guarantors.</p>
<h3>Police Department Expands Investigation Unit, Establishes Six Brigades Distributed Throughout the City.</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] To strengthen the city's security forces, the Garrison Headquarters has expanded the organization of its Investigation Unit. The original four sections—Social Affairs, Economic Affairs, Military Affairs, and Foreign Affairs—and the Garrison Brigade have all been abolished.

<h3>Three Schools Including the Teachers College to Add Secondary School Classes</h3>
<p>Relief for Out-of-School Youth</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] Ye Xinfu, Director of Secondary Education of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Zhong Daozan, Wang Wenxin, and other personnel from the Ministry of Education in Shanghai held a symposium at the Senior Technical Vocational School at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss relief for out-of-school youth in the city. It was decided to add two groups of Yin Zhong and Ju Liang at the Bazilu Normal College (enrollment has begun), and to expand the senior and junior high school classes at Jing Rong Middle School on Ximen Wenmiao Road and Qi Zha Middle School on Tilanqiao Jingzhou Road to accommodate out-of-school youth. The above two middle schools are preparing to add classes and will start registration next week. It is said that they will use vacant classrooms and hold classes from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM every afternoon. Jingye has a history of 49 years and originally had 21 classes. Qi Zha was established to commemorate Nie Rangtai and currently has 24 classes. Fees are lower than those of general private schools. Plans for relief for out-of-school elementary school students are also being actively planned.</p>
<h3>College Presidents Petition; Faculty Associations Fully Support; Striving for a Permanent and Stable Plan to Improve Treatment</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The presidents of twelve national colleges and universities are scheduled to go to Beijing on the 27th to jointly request the government to quickly improve the treatment of faculty and staff, increase recurring expenses, and issue contingency funds. The Shanghai National Specialized College and University Faculty Association expressed its full support for the presidents' actions. Association spokesperson Liu Dajie said yesterday: "This time, the government's treatment adjustment is 75 times in the Beijing-Shanghai area, and the base salary has increased slightly, but it is far from the association's requirement to multiply the original salary by the price index. Calculated according to the adjustment multiple, an assistant teacher and staff member with a monthly salary of 160 yuan will only receive 7,500 yuan per month, and even the highest-level professor with 600 yuan will only receive 16,000 yuan per month. Under the circumstances where daily necessities rise in price every day and water, electricity, and transportation costs increase several times a month, professors still cannot solve the minimum standard of living. The most bizarre thing is that this treatment adjustment did not mention the improvement number for the professor's monthly research fee of 50 yuan, which is clear evidence that the Ministry of Education despises academic research. Therefore, this association specifically requests the presidents of each school to go to Beijing to personally request Acting President Li to seek a reasonable solution to the treatment of faculty and staff. At the time when the new economic plan is being implemented, it is especially important to strive for a permanent and stable plan to improve treatment, which can be based on silver coins or in-kind standards. Never repeat the mistakes of the past where treatment was divorced from prices. The entire faculty of this association will fully support the presidents' hard work in going to Beijing this time. It is hoped that the presidents of each school will argue on the basis of reason and obtain a fundamental solution to this serious problem. As for the increase in recurring expenses and the supplementary issuance of contingency funds, these are urgent matters."</p>
<h3>Repeated Labor Unrest on Two Railways; Suspects of Incitement Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] It was recently learned from the military authorities that labor unrest has repeatedly occurred on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways. Several suspects of inciting the labor unrest have been arrested, including one commissioner from the two railway bureaus. The case is currently under active investigation and is said to be concluded within days.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Against Railway Bureau for Occupying Housing: Plaintiff Wins After Yesterday's Trial and Verdict</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case in which Kang Jinzan sued the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration for occupying his property in Zhabei was concluded yesterday by Judge Ling Yuanqing of the District Court, and the verdict was pronounced: The defendant shall, within one year, return two sheet metal flat houses and twenty-five buildings located in the Xizhongyifang area of Wangjiazhai Road in Zhabei, Shanghai, to the plaintiff for self-demolition. The plaintiff's request for provisional execution was rejected. The defendant shall be responsible for the litigation costs.</p>
<p>According to the plaintiff's agent's statement to the Civil Division of the District Court: The land of over four mu in Xizhongyifang, Zhabei, together with the 25 buildings erected on it, are owned by the plaintiff. During the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy puppet Central China Railway Company forcibly occupied the property, removed the floorboards from all the buildings, transforming them into low flat houses for use as printing facilities. They also added two sheet metal flat houses on the remaining vacant land. After the victory, the defendant forcibly occupied and used the property. After returning to Shanghai after the war, the plaintiff presented the property certificate and applied to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau for its return. The bureau approved the return of the land and original buildings. Regarding the sheet metal houses built by the enemy, according to regulations, the bureau entrusted the China Trust Bureau to notify the land owner to purchase them. After the plaintiff paid the price, a certificate was issued transferring ownership to the plaintiff, and the defendant was notified to choose whether to purchase. Despite repeated written requests from the plaintiff for the defendant to return the property, the defendant ignored them, claiming that the aforementioned land and fixtures were subject to a requisition plan drafted by the two railway bureaus, which had been submitted for approval and allowed for prior use after negotiation of a lease. The plaintiff rejected this claim and filed a lawsuit requesting a judgment ordering the defendant to return the aforementioned property and a declaration for provisional execution.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement Case at China Trust Bureau: Original Ginseng Recovered</h3>

Upon discovery, the entire amount was intercepted by the Tilanqiao Police Station, and the original items have been recovered by the bureau without any losses. All offenders have been transferred to the court for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Mr. Anonymous: Sincere Words; Raises 2.5 Million Yuan While Ill; Exceeds the Target for Shen Bao's Student Aid Fund</h3>
<p>The benevolent "Mr. Anonymous," the student aid elder, recently donated one million gold yuan to this newspaper's "Reader Student Aid Fund," eliciting great sympathy and respect from the people of Shanghai. However, given this newspaper's target of five million gold yuan, it was not easy to reach the full amount immediately. Feeling concerned about the possibility that hundreds of students might have to abandon their studies and in anticipation of aid, the elder personally raised another 2.5 million yuan to supplement this newspaper's student aid fund, bringing this year's student aid campaign to a successful conclusion. His sincere concern for the poor students and his generous donation deeply moved the staff of this newspaper. We respectfully express our gratitude on behalf of the hundreds of impoverished students. Yesterday, we received another letter from Mr. Anonymous, which was full of sincerity and deeply inspiring. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To the Editors of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Regarding the student aid fund for this semester organized by your newspaper, the original target was 500 shi of white rice, or 5 million gold yuan. Based on past performance, this target is not considered large. I recall that during the Anti-Japanese War, your newspaper raised enough student aid funds to support as many as 4,000 impoverished students each year. Now, we only hope to save one-tenth of that number, or 400 students, but it is still difficult to achieve this goal. I cannot help but feel deeply moved. In order to follow your newspaper's call, I donated one million gold yuan on the 21st of this month, bringing the total to 2.5 million yuan, half of the original target. The remaining 2.5 million yuan is still lacking. I hope that your newspaper can generate widespread support and achieve the target through vocal appeals. But as of today, the impoverished students who need help are eagerly anticipating aid. Every day, I read your newspaper and cannot help but feel saddened and uneasy. I had no choice but to appeal to friends despite being ill, and I raised 1.25 million gold yuan from Mr. Ding of Guangyu Tang, 600,000 gold yuan from the combined donation of Hongji, Zuoji, and Guanji, and 650,000 gold yuan from the combined donation of Mingji and Heji, totaling 2.5 million gold yuan. I am sending this to you for receipt so that the impoverished students whose applications have been approved can feel at ease and focus on their studies. Through your newspaper, the original target can be achieved, the mission of serving society can be fulfilled, and I can also fulfill my wish for this year's student aid. Sincerely, Mr. Anonymous, February 5th, Year 38.</p>
<p>The deadline for this newspaper's student aid fund is the end of this month as scheduled. If you wish to donate, please send your donations within the next three days. Although this year's target has been achieved, rescuing students from dropping out is always beneficial, no matter how much.</p>

The railway bureau will also strictly regulate the number of passenger tickets sold for each train and will no longer sell tickets once the limit is reached. "Dan bang" passengers are encouraged to use ordinary passenger trains. Therefore, it has been decided that each ordinary ticket can be used to purchase two baggage tickets to show preference.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Races at the Canidrome: Hweili vs. Perfil</h3>
<p>Tonight's main event in the basketball league is Hweili vs. Perfil. Hweili's new players have returned, and their recent condition is excellent, so the situation has improved. Tonight, they will face the American team Perfil, and it is hoped that they can continue their winning streak. However, the American team is not weak, so they cannot be too careless. The other two games will be a women's game and a Class 2 group game. Ticket prices remain the same. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Li Team vs. Li Team (Women's Group) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Perfil vs. Ping Ping (Class 2C) 6:15 PM</p>

Although they have lost, they are not discouraged and continue to fight hard, which is commendable. Li Team has two wins and one loss. They defeated Xinghua last week, which was not easy. They have a good chance of securing a runner-up spot. Victory today is certain.</p>
<p>In Class 2C, Tarul faces Ping Ping. The former defeated Pang Team and has great fighting power. Although Ping Ping is led by veterans Wang Zhengjun and Xia Zhiong, it may be difficult to blunt its momentum.</p>
<p>In Class 1, Hweili faces Perfil for the first time. Although the American team has lost all five games, they have not lost by much each time. For example, they only lost to Hualian by five points, to Renyu by four points, and to Haiqing by half a goal, which shows that they are not to be trifled with. Hweili has played six games, with half wins and half losses. They recently defeated Encas, which shows their skills. The entire team is fast-paced, and the recent return of Ye Yunshan and Chen Zhengmiao has boosted their morale. It is expected that they will give the foreign soldiers a severe lesson.</p>

However, due to a lack of practice, she was unable to endure a long battle, starting strong but fading later. Fortunately, the all-rounder Li Zhen performed excellently, winning four matches and laying the foundation for the Gas Company's victory. As a result, the Gas Company narrowly defeated the Jewish team by a score of 9 to 7.</p>

<h3>Commodity Market Fluctuates Sharply After New Financial Program Announced; National Bank Sells Gold and Foreign Exchange, Slowing the Rising Trend</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The commodity market in this city experienced a strong reaction after the new financial program was published in the newspaper yesterday. Taking financial commodities that lead prices as an example, the price of gold reached a maximum of 155,000 yuan per tael, but the minimum price in the afternoon was only 138,000 yuan. The peak of the US dollar reached 3,100 yuan, and the minimum price in the afternoon was around 2,780 yuan. The market conditions for other general essential commodities rose rapidly in the morning, weakened in the afternoon, and eventually narrowed. For example, the peak of white rice was 16,000 yuan per shi, and the closing price was 14,000 yuan; 20s Shuangma reached a maximum of 520,000 yuan, and the closing price was 460,000 yuan; coarse granulated sugar peaked at 27,000 yuan, and the closing price was 24,000 yuan; rayon peaked at 700,000 yuan, and the low price was 625,000 yuan; and British American Tobacco cigarettes peaked at 3,000 yuan, and the low price was around 2,800 yuan. Solid soap peaked at 24,000 yuan, and the closing price was 22,000 yuan. The feature of yesterday's market was that the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates actually exceeded that of the US dollar. Because trade controls have been relaxed in the new program, except for oil and tobacco, all are not included in the quota. Therefore, the market scrambled to exchange US dollars for foreign exchange settlement certificates. Due to the relationship between supply and demand, the price of US dollars was lower than that of transfer certificates. Another main reason for the price decline yesterday was the Central Bank's sale of more than 1,500 gold bars in addition to foreign exchange settlement certificates. The money supply tightened, and people panicked. Therefore, the soaring trend, which was like a raging fire, was slightly suppressed.</p>
<h3>Hua Shares Turned Down at the Close</h3>
<p>New Prices Seen Repeatedly in Opening</p>
<p>The new financial reform program was announced and implemented yesterday. The buying and selling of gold and silver is allowed to be free, and the Central Bank is responsible for leveling the prices. People are still optimistic about stocks. The money supply has been loosened, and buying has been rampant, with new prices seen repeatedly. At the opening, Taiwan Sugar immediately reported a limit-up. Within half an hour, Yonggong, Huafeng, Xinya, Zhenqi, Jingfu, Xinhua, Xinyi, Qinxing, and Zhongni all rose to their limit-up levels. There was limited trading at the limit. Those who made profits during the mid-session sold, and peers also sold, and the steady state was stagnant. Before the close, rumors spread that the Central Bank was selling gold, and the money supply stopped loosening and turned tight. The buying interest waned. Floating longs sold in panic, and the downward trend intensified. Yongsha, Meiya, Tongyi, Rongfeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Match all closed at the lowest prices of the session, falling from half a corner to two corners compared with the previous day. Other stocks that were not traded at the close continued to rise by 3% to 24%. Taiwan Sugar alone rose by 1,610 yuan. Trading in various stocks was still strong, reaching a total of 4.6972 billion shares in half a day, including 197 million shares of Yongsha.</p>
<h3>Principal Repayment of Gold Bonds to Be Drawn on March 2</h3>
<p>The first drawing for the principal repayment of the first phase of gold bonds is scheduled to be held on March 2. All sold bonds have been exchanged for formal bonds by the original sales bank from the 23rd with previously issued reservation coupons, and all exchanges are limited to completion before today (the 26th).</p>
<p>Also reported: The National Bank's listed price for short-term gold bonds continued to rise yesterday, set at 100,850 yuan per two-tael denomination.</p>
<h3>China Textile and Construction Continues to Sell; The Yarn Market Saw Both Rises and Falls</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] China Textile and Construction Company continued to list yarn for sale in the market yesterday, but there were few buyers, so it was only sold once. As a result, only 50 pieces were sold. Only 20 households applied to purchase, worth 31.98 million yuan. The opening price for each type of yarn: 6s subsidiary Sun, no one applied, price 190,000 yuan. 32s Xiantao 23 pieces, price 540,000 yuan. 32s Double Twist Happy Crane 10 pieces, price 630,000 yuan. 42s Leaf Twist Mercerized Colored Ball 17 pieces, price 780,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the company routinely sold yarn to the replication industry yesterday, offering a total of ten types, selling 168 pieces, approving 69 households to purchase, worth 111.86 million yuan. The opening price for each type of yarn: 20s Hongfu 380,000 yuan, 16s Red Moon 360,000 yuan, 20s Double Twist Blue Phoenix 455,000 yuan, 32s Sunlight 530,000 yuan, 32s Double Twist Harvest Year 650,000 yuan, 40s Red Treasure Light 660,000 yuan, 42s Double Twist Dragon Gate 670,000 yuan, 40s Three Twist Red Real Light 680,000 yuan, 60s Palace Maid 950,000 yuan, 80s Double Twist TK Colored Ball 2.1 million yuan.</p>
<p>The yarn market presented a wavering situation. At the opening in the morning, due to the significant increase in recent days, people were wary of high prices, and many retail investors sold, reducing the market price compared to before. Afterwards, because the prices of all non-industry items were strong, and the money supply was still loose, the market returned to rising, resulting in more gains than losses. 42s Blue Phoenix rose all the way from 685,000 yuan to 740,000 yuan at closing, rising by 20,000 yuan. 40s Blue Phoenix was up 15,000 yuan, 32s Silver Moon rose from 565,000 yuan to a maximum of 585,000 yuan, and then retreated to 570,000 yuan at noon closing, down 10,000 yuan. 21s Double Horse appeared at an opening of 480,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan from before, but finally retreated to 450,000 yuan, down 10,000 yuan, with the next day's price at 465,000 yuan. 20s Double Horse fell slightly by 5,000 yuan, ending at 430,000 yuan. In addition, Jincheng Xing Tiannv and others also made small gains, and all grades below 16s also rose slightly. There were not many transactions in other yarns, and the market price fluctuated narrowly.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Prices Soar; New Prices Repeatedly Seen in the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market reached its peak. With the money supply still loose and people increasingly excited, various cloths showed unprecedented new highs amid the soaring prices. At the opening, the leading fine cloth was 19,500 yuan, and the Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji was 18,300 yuan. Retail investors raised prices one after another, and the prices soared. The former once rose to 20,700 yuan, and the latter to 19,800 yuan. By the time of the noon closing, it was heard that the black market had weakened, and the market price slightly declined. The closing price for fine cloth was 19,700 yuan, and the Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji was 18,700 yuan, jumping 1,700 yuan to 2,550 yuan higher than before. Trumpet Boy fine cloth rose from 18,100 yuan to a maximum of 19,000 yuan, and finally closed at 18,300 yuan, rising by 2,300 yuan. B Leading fine cloth finally closed at 19,200 yuan, up 3,400 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong rose by 2,800 yuan, ending at 18,900 yuan. In addition, the factory prices of 190 Shilin and Yuan cloth, etc., were all increased by about 15%.</p>
<h3>Impact of Rising Gold Prices on the Rice Market: Surge in Prices</h3>
<p>Rice prices soared dramatically yesterday. At the market's opening, due to the sharp rise in gold prices, sellers raised their prices. Later, as gold prices rapidly declined, the rice market was nearing its close, so the price increases still prevailed. In the Southern Rice Market, Bai Geng (white polished rice) once reached 15,000 yuan, and Bo Dao (thin rice) also exceeded 15,000 yuan. When news of the gold price drop arrived, the market weakened slightly. At the close, Bai Geng was at 14,600 yuan, and Bo Dao was at the same price as Bai Geng, an increase of 3,200-3,300 yuan compared to the previous day. Early rice and glutinous rice prices uniformly rose by about 30%. In the Northern Rice Market, Bai Geng and Bo Dao rose by 3,800 to 3,000 yuan. The total arrivals at both markets were 6,660 shi (a unit of dry measure).</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: Trading opened very late. Due to the fluctuating gold prices, the market sentiment remained calm, and prices remained stable. The opening price was slightly higher than the previous day by 3,000-4,000 yuan. The closing price eventually followed the gold price down slightly, resulting in a flat day compared to the previous day. Soybean oil opened at 58,000 yuan and closed at 55,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil was at 51,000 yuan, unchanged from the previous day. Jiangbei pure raw oil opened at 60,000 yuan in the morning. Soybean cakes initially rose but then declined, ultimately weakening.</p>
<p>Flour: Initially firm, then declined. At the start, due to the continued loose monetary policy and the sharp rise in gold, paper money, and rice prices, market sentiment was extremely bullish. Old military ship flour once broke through the 6,000 mark. Later, due to the small declines in prices of other commodities and rumors of the Central Bank releasing a large amount of gold, it was widely expected that the silver market would tighten sharply, and sellers rushed to sell. The market then saw a decline, nearing the 6,000 mark at the close. Old Car flour retreated to 5,850 yuan, and Military Ship flour stabilized at 5,500 yuan. Bran, affected by flour prices, also initially rose but then declined. Large bags were trading at 4,350 yuan today.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Firm. Soybeans were generally stable compared to the previous day's close. Zha Dou (pea beans) traded at 11,000 yuan, and Che Dou (cart beans) rose slightly by 500 yuan. Only corn saw aggressive buying from the Qing Gang (Green Gang), initially rising sharply by 20%. However, the market ultimately cooled down due to sluggish actual sales, and the increase decreased. Huangdu corn retreated to the 6,000 mark at the close. There was not much sesame trading, and raw peanuts saw only a slight increase.</p>
<h3>Sparse Tea Market Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market saw transactions as rare as morning stars. Although buyers launched offensives on various red and green tea grades, scarce supply made it difficult to succeed. The trend was initially quite favorable, further stimulated by the soaring foreign exchange transfer certificates in recent days, making it feel even more prosperous. Prices increased across the board. While the silver market is tightening, the tea market does not seem constrained.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate Transactions Still Handled According to Original Regulations</h3>
<p>No Changes Permitted Before Notification from the National Bank</p>
<p>[Our Report] After the announcement of the new financial reform plan, the reporter inquired with a responsible person of a designated bank association yesterday regarding whether there had been any changes in the way foreign exchange transfer certificates are traded. According to the response: As of now, the trading of foreign exchange transfer certificates is still carried out in accordance with the provisions of Circular No. 170 issued by the Central Bank on January 10 of this year, that is, the foreign exchange transfer certificates of exporters are only allowed to be sold to importers. According to the provisions of the new financial plan, the use and buyers of such foreign exchange transfer certificates have been expanded. However, designated banks will not make any changes to the original trading method before receiving a new circular from the National Bank to change the provisions of Circular No. 170.</p>
<h3>Silk Initially High, Then Declined</h3>
<p>The human silk market situation yesterday saw a rapid rise and a quick decline. Initially, after the announcement of the financial reform plan, market sentiment was normal, and gold prices outside the circle rose sharply, followed by a surge in foreign exchange transfer certificates. The market atmosphere was sharp, and the trading on the floor was prosperous, with bidding reaching repeated highs.</p>
<p>No. 120 Tianqiao (Sky Bridge) silk opened in the morning at a high of 700,000, once reaching 720,000. After the high, market sentiment remained firm, and the market atmosphere remained prosperous. Until after 11:00, it was heard that the authorities were tightening the money supply, and there were rumors that banks were stopping interbank lending. As a result, market sentiment became fearful, and overseas gold plummeted. Many rushed to sell, and the market trend declined. The midday close was as low as 660,000. Signs of market increase were seen. In the afternoon, overseas gold gradually declined, and market sentiment became scattered. The market situation still saw a small decline of about 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The market price of raw silk foreign exchange transfer certificates rose sharply, and market sentiment was optimistic. Holders took the opportunity to hold up prices, and the market atmosphere was initially high and then declined. Superior grades initially traded at 750,000-760,000. Upon hearing news of excellent gold prices, the price rose immediately, shouting prices as high as 800,000-805,000 yuan. Before noon, commodity prices outside the circle reported small declines, and gold rose and declined sharply. Market sentiment turned soft, and the market also saw a sharp decline at midday close. In the afternoon, overseas gold prices continued to decline. Furthermore, due to rumors that the authorities would greatly tighten the money supply and that winter could see a terrible crash, the market trend was very soft, and bidding prices continued to decline, ultimately ending the day at 730,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The silk fabric market situation yesterday was initially affected by the sharp rise in gold prices, greatly boosting market sentiment. Upon hearing of the rapid decline in gold prices, the market trend suddenly stalled. Meiya initially traded at 485,000 yuan. After the high, it once weakened, retreating to 470,000 yuan. At the close, due to the continuation of floating orders, the environment was unfavorable, and bidding prices saw another decline. The market situation entered a stalemate, ultimately ending the day at 430,000.</p>
<h3>Broadcloth Rises Again</h3>
<p>The standard broadcloth market price, affected by the rising prices of gold, paper money, rice, silk yarn, and silk fabrics, and the continued loose monetary policy, with interbank lending rates lower than term deposits, and no special changes following the announcement of the new economic plan, caused everything to rise again. Xie Xin, Yuan Feng, and Dacheng flannel were all quoting at 13,500 yuan per yard, Zhang Hua and Yin Feng at 12,500 yuan, Hong Xiang at 11,500 yuan, Hong Xiang Fan Li Ding at 9,000 yuan, Yue Cheng Paisley at 8,250 yuan, No. 55 and Shuang Mao medium-thick kersey at 9,250 yuan, De Feng gray soft lining at 360 yuan, and Da Tong mercerized feather yarn at 675 yuan. All transactions, large and small, require immediate payment by check; otherwise, interest will be added. It appears that the cutting sales of gown materials are more active than the sales of Western-style clothing. The general stores are busy raising prices and rehanging price tags.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Surges</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Tung and Shantou Oil market radiated brilliance, with a price surge as fiery as tea. The reasons were the continuation of the previous day's momentum and the absence of any disadvantages to the industry after the announcement of the new economic plan. Furthermore, all financial commodities and commodities outside the circle uniformly climbed to new heights, so market sentiment was high, and buying was soaring. Sellers' prices continued to rise sharply, ultimately resulting in a significant increase of 5,000 to 10,000 yuan compared to before.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Mr. Fei Liangmo, the manager of the American President Company, is returning to the United States from Shanghai today, carrying a large quantity of fresh eggs, about 300 tons, or approximately 7,000 paper boxes, bound for San Francisco.</p>
<p>Cigarettes, soap, and matches continued to rise sharply, due to the rising prices of commodities outside the circle and the continued loose monetary policy. Retail purchases were quite strong, and prices rose uniformly. At the close, there was a slight decline, slightly less than the market list prices. White tin-packed cigarettes listed at 3,250 yuan, but the actual transaction price was only around 3,100 yuan. The rising trend of soap and matches was even stronger, with each grade rising by 20% to 50%. Gu Ben high strength firecrackers were about 24,300 yuan. Beautiful Matches surged past the 100,000 mark, reaching a new high price of 110,000.</p>
<p>The tin foil market situation was chaotic, with few formal transactions taking place. Retailers limited sales to one piece. Yesterday's price jumped to double the previous day's price.</p>
<p>Yesterday's highest price for Carnation milk powder was 235,000, and the closing price was 200,500.</p>
