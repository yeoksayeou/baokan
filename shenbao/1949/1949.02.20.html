<p>〔聯合社南京十九日電〕今夜據悉，邵力子在北平與華北解放區人民政府主席董必武作長談，董氏聞曾提出數項建議，請其轉交南京政府，官方對於和談局勢顯甚樂觀，僉認此係上海和平代表團抵平後之最重要進展，但詳情如何，須俟代表團歸來，始能分曉。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十九日電〕據接近李代總統之人士稱，毛澤東如願會晤，則李氏將樂於會見毛氏。據稱，李代總統尙未考慮親自會晤毛氏，但如被邀，渠將飛平會晤毛氏。中共之北平「人民日報」曾載稱，李氏如決定來此，將受歡迎。官方於收聰中共十八日晚廣播後，對和平前途均抱樂觀，並指此次廣播較以前「語調比較合理」。按中共此次廣播對李宗仁及孫科第一次避免引用「僞總統」及「僞行政院長」字樣。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十九日電〕鍾天心十九日下午三時三刻乘央航機飛滬轉京，鍾氏此行携有孫院長致李代總統私人函件，並報吿渠赴港與中共華南代表洽談經過。鍾氏起飛前語記者：就渠此次赴港商談結果觀察，雙方和談距離已漸縮短，共方似不希望以武力解決整個問題，蓋共方曾控制廣大農村十餘載，其對管理都市之經騐及幹部均感缺乏，此可能爲遲遲朱積極渡江之一因也。鍾氏繼對外傳部份人士對孫內閣不滿間題發表談話稱：按憲法規定，國會新政策如經半數以上委員參加，三分之二通過，此新政策內閣不能同意時可辭職，否則立院並無要求內閣辭職之權力。鍾氏幷稱，孫院長血壓仍甚高，暫不能赴京，如李總統有必需促其返京時，渠當亦前往。鍾氏末稱，渠定一週後返穗，在共方未有正式表示時，暫不飛平。</p>
<p>〔聯合社廣州十九日電〕吳裕後十九日在此宣稱，孫科內閣將單獨嘗試經由香港與中共接洽，俾就和平問題交換意見，余定廿日赴港，向該地中共負責人傳達孫氏意見，請其轉交華北當局，一部份觀察家僉認，孫氏該項舉動，企國爭取政治上之支持力量。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕前南京人民和表代表團吳裕後由滬飛穗後所發表之言論，復引起該團其他代表之不滿，該團發言人曾資生，十九日在京發表聲明，重申該團業已撤銷，並指斥吳裕後之目的爲「假藉代表團名議與政院及各方接洽，其他則非渠所關懷」。中共方面連日廣播，曾指責反對和平者破壞南京人民和平代表團，實則此項「破壞」係出於吳裕後個人言行之不檢，而引起該團其他代表對吳之攻擊也。曾資生之聲明稱，吳裕後在港·粵之言行，與該團無涉，並謂：「前此本團代表共三人，余今日之發言，至少仍可代表邱致中，鄧季雨，宋國樞，夏元芝等多數代表之意見」。曾氏否認合衆社香港廿三日電載吳裕後談代表團向中共提七項建議之說，謂均與事實不符。「代表團的建議，根本無吳君所稱雙方軍隊各自現陣地後退四十里與政治協商召集地點完全由中共決定之建議，其他各項，亦多錯離，而無倫次」。曾氏並聲明：「外傳吳君已向政府騙取巨款，亦與吾人無涉」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕據悉：中國各大學敎授國策硏究會，近將在滬集會，改選常委，對吳裕後之言行，聞亦將提出討論。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕立法院第三會期會議，決定在南京復會，童冠賢院長十九日在京正式宣吿此事，立委報到定廿一日開始，一俟達法定人數卽行開會，預料在本月底以前可望開議。據悉：立院在京復會事，係於十八晚童冠賢謁李代總統並訪徐堪後所作之決定，主要問題爲經費，業經順利解決。童氏十九日晨將此項決定通知十八日促渠發出開會通知之留京立委代表處郁文。李峯。王鴻韶轉吿各委員。留京立委原定十九日下午三時再開談話會，因亦臨時取消。立法院秘長陳克文，十九日亦急電穗·合。桂。長。漢各地立委，請卽日來京出席，開會之正式通知，一二日內卽可正式發出。又立院人事處十九日發出通吿，凡該院留用職員，統限本月底以前向南京或廣州報到，逾期一律解職。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕立法院長童冠賢十九日致電在穗之副院長劉健韋，促其早日返京。又抵穗之立委王啓江等數人，十九日已自穗返京，據王氏談，在穗立委多人，已表示為顧全團結起見，如立院在京復會時，決返京參加</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十九日電〕留穗立委頃續有多人飛京，刻在穗辦事處登記第三期報到立委僅有狄膺等廿七名，全部在穗立委，截至目前爲止不足五十人，在穗復會之舉，恐已難望實現，惟在穗立委仍積極進行計劃在穗復會工作</p>

<p>〔本報廣州十九日電〕穗緩署頃奉國防部電令，增派吳奇偉陳策·梁華盛·徐景唐爲該署副主任。按四副主任均爲粵名將一，抗戰期間迭著勳勞，此次出膺副職，聞將分區坐鎭粵各重鎭，主持地方綏靖工作。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕首都衛戍總司令張耀明，十九日晨十時出席京市參議會，除對首都治安維持。軍紀整飭有所報吿外，並對全面和平特別强調。張氏謂，邇來和平空氣甚囂塵上，但和須能平，並須全面和平，否則卽是投降，所以我們要求的是全面和平，倘局部和平，就成了局部投降，南京既有友厚兵力，且有長江天險，絕可有恃無恐，所以大家應向前面看，不要向往台灣等地逃難的人看。現國民黨尙有日分之九十有作爲者，只要大家決心改革，團結一致，則所企求的全面和平必可成功。</p>

<h3 id="c9">李代總統召集財經要員　續商新經濟方案　滬銀錢業將休假說不確 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕新經濟方案十九日續由財政經濟要員在京商討。李代總統十八日晚召集徐堪·劉攻芸等舉行會議，迄夜十二時始畢。十九日下午二時半，李代總統復在官邸召集徐堪劉攻芸·龐松舟等舉行會議，繼續縝密硏討新經濟措施，中國銀行總經理席德懋亦應邀參加，席氏係十八日與徐堪同自滬來京者，會議復歷一小時許。徐。劉等十九日上午曾分別訪晤于右任。顧祝同等，下午一時半，徐堪並往訪閻錫山，談話近一小時。晚七時，周至柔宴請徐等。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日市塲謠傳政府爲實施新經濟方案，將於明日起命銀錢業休假三天，並有限制提存等措施。記者頃以此事詢諸銀行公會某負責人，據云：絕無此事。政府如有此項措置，自必先由金管局通知銀錢業公會，轉知會員行莊遵辦。但截至今晚爲止，公會並未接得通知，本人與畢德林局長通話時，畢局長亦謂毫無所聞。據個人看法，謠言之來，可能因改革幣制時銀錢業有封關之舉，故值此新方案實施前夕，市塲有此推測。惟若發行銀圓與准許金銀自由買賣，則與過去幣制改革之性質完全不同，故行莊休假不致成爲事實。</p>

<p>〔中央社廣州十九日電〕外傳政府發行金圓券總額，截至最近止已達八百億元，或謂已逾千億元。記者頃就此事詢諸有關當局負責人，據稱：發行總額實數爲二百億元左右，外問揣測均屬無稽。渠復吿記者謂，倘照市價黃金每兩售十萬元計算，僅合黃金二十萬兩，而政府現在掌握之黃金超過四百萬兩，其他外匯白銀物資尙未計算在內。目前金圓券之貶値，以及物價之高漲，當非完全通貨膨脹所致，其主要之因素，實緣大多數人之心理，鑒於大局之不安定有以致之。目前財政當局已擬有整理財政安定金融經濟之整個辦法，不久卽可實施。最後，渠并以極堅決語氣吿記者，以渠個人之觀察，當前單獨以財政而言，深信不致成爲問題，其關鍵在如何澄濟當前之局勢，安定全國之人心而已。</p>

<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>—為息災法會及佛敎青年會徵求會員而作—</p>
<p>現在人人渴望和平，不獨我們中閱人，卽其他各國的人民也都無不希望弭戰銷兵，安居樂業。聯合國之所以成立，就是想爲人類諦造永久的和平·和平之在人們心目中，眞所謂人同此心，心同此理。</p>
<p>國父孫中山先生彌留時的遺言，就是一句：「和平，奮鬥，救中國！」中國人在幾千年來傳統文化陶冶培養之中，愛好和平幾已成了天性。孔子自謂不學戰陣之事；孟子說「春秋無義戰」，且謂「不嗜殺人者能一之」；老子說「佳兵不祥」，卽著兵法的孫子也說「兵者，國之大事，死生之地，存亡之道，不可不察也。」凡此可見中國民族是在和平而不好戰的文化中孕育成長的。然則，現在爲什麼當頻年戰亂以後，大家聲嘶力竭地呼籲和平，而和平還不能早日實現呢？</p>
<p>我以爲「和平」是戰爭的反面，戰爭必有雙方，故和平亦必由雙方同感其迫切需要，同有互諒互讓的風度，同有推己及人的想法，然後可望日趨接近。換言之，要做到和平的「和」，不可不先達到和平的「平」。然則如何可以近於「平」呢？必須認眞從走近「中」道開始·中庸說：「中也者，天下之大本也；和也者，天下之違道也，致中和，夭地位焉，萬物青正』。惟有「中」，纔不偏；惟不偏，纔能平；惟有平，纔能和。故假使要用「不是東風壓倒西風，就是西風壓倒東風」的方法來尋求和平，那必將使循環報復，永無已時，而眞正的永久的和平亦恐渺不可得。佛家之所以力主「寃仇宜解不宜結」者，其故當在此。</p>
<p>在人人呼籲和平聲中，已丑度亡利生息災法會在上海已於二月十五日起修，並請全國寺院及佛敎團體亦同心修法息災，同時上海市佛敎靑年會也從今天（二十日）起第三屆徵求會員，從事弘法利生的事業。或者以爲在國事蜩；人命螻蟻的今日，不去幹些救國救民的工作，而只鼓吹飯依三　，求助於佛，豈非流於消極，近乎迷信？其實，這種看法是世俗的漢見，並未能眞正窺見佛法的眞義。相反地，我認爲世界人類要眞正和平，必須弘揚佛法，尤其必須先從戒殺做起。我願以幼稚的佛弟子的身份，敬謹貢獻四點意見。</p>
<p>第一，佛法是主張圓滿平峰的，　　牟尼佛以王子之尊專，苦行修道，成道以後，稅法四十九年，其動機全在憐憫衆生，　　衆生。佛的發心在於　張洞明全宇宙一切衆生悉皆平等。固然，佛爲人天所皈敎，而佛却敎人觀照，明心見性，使大家眞能知道　嚴經所云「心佛及衆生，是三無差別」，換言之，一切衆生，本具佛性；一　衆生，都可成佛·迷爲衆生，覺卽成佛。試想，在六道輪　中的衆生，不論天·人·阿修羅·書生，儀鬼。地獄，只要精進修持，轉迷成覺，都有成佛的可龍。這種廣大的胸襟，透澈的認職，伏界上古往今來，還有那一種講究平等的學說可以超過佛法的敎義？講階級鬥爭的對別一階級固然不講平等；講全民平等的，對別一民族也未必講平等；卽使進而講人類平等的，對人類以外的衆生，自然不見得再願意講平等。章太炎先生曾說：「處無，非佛家本旨；……五戒使人作善，……亦非佛所獨有；鄙意平等一義，出世入世，悉當奉爲科律，是乃眞爲佛法勝處耳。……眞平等者，非獨與萬物不生殊念，卽是非善惡亦皆泯然齊同。……今在共和之世，階位已夷，而黨伐彌甚，試以此道濟之，庶乎其可，」章氏在民國初年這番話，確實指出了佛法是千古救世的眞理。現在要祈求和平，必須大家能眞切信奉佛法平等的敎義，絕不對衆生（人對人更不必說）生起一念「非親友」的設想，眞所謂人我兩忘，究親平等，然後大家至誠懺悔一切過去的惡乘，和衷共濟，心平氣和地重新做起，自然可以感召祥和，息災弭戰，使國家康樂，世界太平。</p>
<p>第二，佛法是主張積極救世的。許多人以爲佛法講　無，敎人知道「四大皆空」，以「了生死，出世間」爲理想，遂詆佛法為　　　爲毀滅人類。從前我也如此想法。但稍加研究，就悟所見之似是而非。大乘佛法的真精神是「無相」二字。金剛經謂　若見諸相非相，卽覓如來。」無相的最精義，尤在「無我相」。所謂四大皆空者，誠如梵網經所云：「一切地水，是我先身，一切火風，是我本體，」令人明白「我』的身體，乃地水火風四大所幻化，亳無執着的價値，其所謂「空」者在此。然而佛是要以大慈大悲大喜大捨的心陽來救世利生的，故佛法又決不是空而反成爲「不空」了。由於澈底的「空」乃能完全忘了自我，「無我相」的人自然隨時隨地都不惜犧牲自己。由於澈底的「不空」，乃能發出救世利生的大願，實行損己利他的功德。佛和菩薩，都是以「出世」的證果，達「入世」的宏願的。佛說：「我當下地獄。不惟下地獄，且常住地獄；不惟常住，且常樂地獄；不惟常樂，且莊嚴地獄」。太着這樣慈悲的大願來救世，眞是再要比他積極沒有了。佛法教人動修六度，布施和忍辱，都是極重要的途徑。眞能用布施和忍辱的精神去救世利生，去尋求和平，和平還有不能獲得的嗎？（下文轉入第七版）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十九日廣播：政府高級官員稱：美政府於向國會提出大西洋公約後，將另案請求國外授權以軍火援助歐洲各國。此案將爲「環球性的」，斯坎的那維亞各國當不致被擯於此項援助之外。此項軍事援助之總値，將在十億美元至二十億之間。至此案之措詞及詳細內容，將視今後數月中局勢之變化而定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十九日廣播：今日艾契遜突與加拿大及西歐五國之使節，舉行關於大西洋公約之重要會議。國務院發言人稱，此項會議係「非正式」討論性質，其目的在使此六國知悉艾氏昨日與參院外委會談判情形。據傳在上次會議中，艾氏曾要求美國在條約中所担負之義務，不應提及美國給予軍事援助之可能性。但參院外委會認為公約不必明白規定如簽約國被攻擊時美政府絕對不可能使用武力。在討論該公約時，美國指出祗有國會有權宣戰，故美國欲在條文中强調各簽約國對於應付武力攻擊，應有決定採取何種行動之自主權。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕國務卿及主要參議員十九日開始共同研討北大西洋公約。艾契遜昨晚將保守極度機密已久的七國公約初步草案，送交參院外委俞審閱。委員會對艾氏在原基礎上繼續進行談判，並未引起嚴重反對。此項旨在防止歐洲侵略的條約，保證美國在任何簽字國被攻擊時，將採取立卽行動，加以協助，但關於應採何種步驟的問題，則應由每一國家自由決定。在會議中，參議員洛奇及若千其他參議員主張該約應再予加强，渠等敦促艾獎遜在公約中，明白指出美國言在必行，有意以「應倒的軍事力量，迎擊任何侵略」。但委員會主席康納利及參院兩黨外交政策最高發言人范登堡警吿稱，如硬性規定參戰義務，將使該約在提交參院批准時，喪失贊成的票數。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約十八日電〕瑞典恐懼挪威成爲土耳其，已在冷戰中增加一新名詞。傳瑞典官方所恐懼者，挪威若簽訂北大西洋條約，蘇聯將不祗採取外交方法，，而陳兵邊境，威脅挪威，使其不得不動員軍隊，以致經濟竭蹶，依賴外援益返，美國因此增加負担，而在冷戰中造成另一連鎖反應。史恐蘇聯對挪威之示威，將涉及瑞典本身，卽由蘇軍佔領面對瑞京之芬蘭亞偷羣島，不啻以手槍直指瑞典心臟。如此則瑞典亦將成爲土耳其。蘇聯由擴張派之壓力，迫令他國支出巨額金錢，實行軍事經濟動員，使全世界處於土耳其地位。此舉是否有意，雖不可知，但就蘇聯立塲言，其作用在削弱資本經濟。依照共黨敎條，此作用漸深，則可使資本國家因被迫競爭，而自相殘殺，趨於崩潰，共黨卽可不勞而獲，實行世界革命。蘇聯於西方國家趨向第二次世界大戰時，卽已預期此事。一面與德簽訂中立條約，非此則希特勒不敢侵犯波蘭；一面復與日本訂立不侵犯條約，非此不致有偸製珍珠港事件</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕第四屆市長盃足球賽，昨日揭幕，第一塲龍頭對志超，在逸園舉行，結果，大出二千觀衆意料之外，志超奮發有爲，以二比零淘汰龍頭，升入第二週，上半時志超連中二球，下半時未開紀錄。志超小將昨日奮勇作戰，努力異常，吳祺祥坐鎭中堅，使龍頭一次又一次之攻勢，完全粉碎，龍頭前鋒竟難越關山一步，亦可謂得意之作。</p>
<p>龍頭先攻，未有所獲，志超反擊，尙世琪沿邊疾進，向中央挑送，球落左方，於洽興右傳，錢元慶於廿五碼外猛射，球向龍門右上角直入，高維辰竟瞠目不知所措，志超先開紀錄，士氣大振。龍頭在莫明其妙首失此球，全軍展開猛烈反攻，張吉良姚慶昇遠近高低，紛紛射擊，皆未命中。志超防衛綫在吳祺祥統率下，固若金湯。姜琨深入，迫成角球亦無效果。半小時已去，閻承寬受傷離塲，王步榮入替。志超朱家錚沿邊再入，王寶山欲阻不及，球向中傳，於洽興臥地一鏟，又落網窩，上半時志超二比零佔得優勢。</p>
<p>下半時兩軍重聚，龍頭張全根入替姚慶昇，志超以勝利在握，嚴取守勢，全軍後移，於是形成拉鋸戰。許大爲受傷，徐國平入代，江雷犯規，王寶山主罰，俱無建樹，志超疲態漸露，龍頭欲進無路，笛聲鳴時，志超二比零淘汰龍頭。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國立交通大學。復旦大學，曁南大學，同濟大學。上海商學院。上海醫學院。上海音樂專科學校。吳淞商船專科學校。幼稚師範專科學校。唐山工學院等十校敎授聯誼會，昨日聯名發表「告社會人士書」，字裏行間，充滿辛酸悲憤。此外並有一函致全國各報館轉各界同胞，文稱：「我們因行政院及敎育部倉皇星散，漠視我們的生活不顧，呼籲無門，特發表吿社會人士書。査當政袞袞諸公薪給亦與公敎人員相同，如果沒有不正當收入，也該如我們同一慘苦命運，可是事實上他們有的擁有大量金鈔，有的在海內外各地都市廣置地皮大廈，平日享受程度超過古代帝王，就是爲他們所龔斷的國營金融及企業機構的同樣公務人員與公丁茶役月俸所入，也無不倍蓗於我們而差足目給，似此以鑒雙之作風養肥自己，以飢餓之政策摧殘師儒，措施乖謬，史無前例，諸君聞之當亦爲之不平，敬乞予以聲援，共代呼籲，不勝切禱」。</p>
<p>告社會人士書　原文如下：我們是上海市國立專科以上學校的敎授，獻身大學敎育工作多年，祗想聊蓋棉力，敎育下一代的靑年。在八年抗戰期間，顚沛流離，含辛茹苦，自是中國國民之分所應受。不意勝利之後，政府當局不僅沒有注意於改善我們的生活，而且改革幣制失策，任幣値一再跌低，發與我們的薪給，却變本加厲地低打折扣，使我們窘迫得無法維持生活。我們的底薪，最高每月六百元，最低二百四十元，講師助敎職員們的還要更低，就現今最高級而論，一折二扣，依十五倍計算，每月得金圓券二千〇七十元，不過市價</p>
<p>銀洋一元左右</p>
<p>就是這個數目，也因爲行政院倉皇離京，主管無人，不知到我們手頭時還値得幾多。就眼前所得而論，以之買米，不足兩斗，用以買菜，每日不够蔬菜斤半，終年所得，不足以付眼前一月水電煤氣之需，通合配米三斗，亦不易餬一人之口，那裏還講得上「仰事俯畜」，更說不上送子女入學，我們敎育別人子女，却被迫要讓自已十女失學，世間不平之事，孰逾於此。至於所謂學術研究費，敎授每月五十元，副敎授四十元，不够買一張當天的報紙。上海市政府公佈二月份上半期生活指數爲三百四十九倍，而我們的却不知究竟如何。我們的意見，應該依照我們的原薪不折不扣地按上海的物價指數依期實發</p>
<p>孫內閣成立後</p>
<p>不惟對立法院咨請執行調整公敎人員待遇案擱置不理，而敎育部代部長到職後，對於上海國立大專校長及敎授會呼籲，復始終充耳不聞，首都尙未聞共軍之砲聲，陳雪屛代部長早已倉　挾款飛穗，祗團少數大員的荀安，忍令學府千萬人啼飢號寒，實屬違棄職守，目無敎育，若非此次代表入京請援，</p>
<p>辛獲一億以歸</p>
<p>此間學府殆難支持，然而杯水車薪，還是無濟於事。同人等迫不獲已，用特昭吿社會，使舉世皆知凟職棄責之罪狀，與同人等艱苦維持之實情，敢祈共同奮起，請求李代總統立監兩院迅予分別依法糾彈，一面督促行政院速照立法院調整公敎人員待遇決議案，按原薪不折不扣，每半月依當時當地物價指數調整發放，並合理調整硏究費，同時援照南京之例，迅予按照調整薪額發給應變費，以平公憤，而解倒懸。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕停業已屆六閱月之本市證券交易所，現已決定於明日正式復業。該所復業後，決定開拍者有股票（包括國營民營事業股票）及黃金短期公債兩種。股票中民營事業部份，除八一九前原已上市之卅四種外，明起將增加振華油漆公司一種。尙餘世界書局，浦東電氣及市輪渡三種，近期亦卽可陸續上市。國營事業部份，台糖公司準可於明日上市，台灣造紙正接洽上市中，招商局則待請示交通部後決定，中國紡建公司則趕辦上市手續中，及時趕辦竣事，則可望於明日上市，否則須延遲二日。股票暫限做前市，除假期日外，每日自上午九時半至中午十二時半為止。黃金短期公債，待財部將券樣送到，卽行開拍，可做一日期貨，開拍時間分前後市，前市時間與股票同，後市自下午二時至三時。證交並定於每日下午三時半起，與各經紀人對帳。</p>
<p>該所總經理顧善昌，特於昨日上午十時半，召集經紀人公會理監事談話，對復業後之各種交易技術問題，交換意見頗詳。</p>
<p>昨日下午二時，顧總經理在該所舉行記者招待會。顧氏除卽席報吿八一九停業及此次復業經過外，並稱：「自本所停業後，一切謠言和物價高漲，並不因本所停業而减少或消滅。這可證明交易所市塲，祇有受造謠及物價高漲的影響，並不負造謠與領導物價的資任。此次復業，完全奉行政府的政令，而交易所的任務，也經明白指出是「政府為疏導游資，穩定經濟，特准上海證交復業。」顧氏末稱：「本人辦事，向以實事求是為宗旨，決不離開事實說話做事。尙望各界多多指敎。）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：黃金公債首次抽籤還本付息，將於三月二日舉行，國行並將定期公吿，由承購人持具預約券，前住掉換正式債票。昨日公債又掛升兩千元，計每兩七萬七千五百元，公債銷路不暢每日僅一百餘兩·關於公債牌價之一再提高，據有關人士解釋有兩重作用，一為鼓勵社會人士購買公債，故使黃金公債上漲之速度較黑市黃金為快，二為藉公債牌價提高，以便大量吸收游資。因黃金公債目前均為預約券，故暫不上市，聞財部限於三月二日之前換取正式債票，故公價之正式上市開拍，將在三月初旬云。</p>

<p>昨日爲週末，本市銀根走勢，全面轉趨平穩。市間頭寸供源，因連日物價坐定，而市拆仍高，頗有脫貨放息。故見旺盛，而需求反轉寥落。市塲拆息，晨做日拆八十元模樣，近午一致下低，約在七十元邊盤旋，甚至六十元，亦有供出。</p>
<p>現鈔籌碼，昨日續呈匱象，業外需要未减，而業內仍少外供，本票流行更甚，貼水堅坐每百元六至八元間，行莊限額仍為五千元至一萬元，鈔荒現象，短期內難望好轉。</p>

<p>四二支藍鳳由五十八萬元一路喊　至六十四萬元收市，激挺十四萬元。四〇支藍鳳升十三萬五千無，三二支銀月晨開四十五萬元，最後站住五十萬元大關，軋高十萬元、</p>

<p>棉布續趨萎靡，銀根雖轉露鬆勢，人心亦隨之向高，但以本街與客帮俱無買意，塲內僅皮球交易，晨開在握貨者拉提下，市勢曾見扳高，嗣以實銷淸閒而落疲途，臨收聞棉紗報漲二成左右，市價乃吿回振，但較前仍見軋小</p>

<h3 id="c106">由和平說到佛敎戒殺　（上接二版） <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>第三，佛法是主張着徧戒殺的。我們之所以要和平，就是因爲戰爭使生動塗炭。人類的戰爭是人類自相殘殺的極致。中國的戰爭是中國同胞自相殘殺的極致。我們曉得殘殺的痛苦，所以要呼籲和平；那麽其他被殺的生靈，它們沒有痛苦嗎？它們又向誰去呼籲呢？試想，每天成千成萬被宰的牛羊鷄豕乃至其他一切含生秉氣的動物，它們都有生命，都有知覺，無辜被殺，有不含電積憤的嗎？陸放翁詩：「血肉淋漓味足珍，一般苦痛怨難伸。設身處地捫心想，誰肯將刀割自身」？願　禪師偈云：「千百年來碗裏羨，寃深如海恨難平。欲知世上刀兵刦，但聽屠門夜半聲。」今姑不談因果報應之理，就只設想我們人類但憑智巧，天天殺禽獸的生命以供自己口腹之欲，而恬不以爲怪，則人類之中，各以智巧相競，强凌弱，衆暴寡，一至於烽火瀰天，也勢必視若無觀，而或且假藉「物競天擇」之說以文過而飾非。故殺禽獸之不已，必至於人相殺；人相殺之不已，必至於禽獸爭食人類之肉。近來戰區裏死亡軍民，未嘗掩埋，竟被鳥獸啄食者，比比皆是，其故可以深長思了。何况，像上海這樣繁華的都市，雖在戰時，流亡載這，哀鴻遍野，而山珍海味，一席數萬金者，所在都有。天下豈有廣大羣衆瀕於死亡的邊緣，而少數豪富還獨可以窮奢極欲，快其朵頤之理下故息災祈和的入手處，就該力行戒殺。（自然包括不嗜殺人。）聽說上海息災法會發起人會經分函市政府和參議會，請求在四十九天法會期間，禁屠三天，以期感召祥和。我以爲這是很有意義的一件事。就算要供給駐防軍隊的肉食，也正好格外每週禁屠一天，讓一般富有的市民省出大批猪肉來移供士兵之需，也可减少上海市民的殺業。市政府縱不爲弘揚佛法計，也當爲物力維艱着想，用規定日期禁屠的方法來强制節約呀！</p>
<p>第四，佛法是主張禮鐵度亡的。佛法的敎義，原是認定「諸法所生，唯心所現」，故臨終一念之所繫，卽爲輪迴六道之根源。惟其如此，我們要利生息災，不能遺忘了那些因戰爭而已經死亡的軍民同胞。文王發政施仁，必先施於課寡孤獨等四類窮而無吿之民。但是我們須得知道，還有「死而無吿」的鬼魂咧！我們對日本打了八年的仗，我們勝利了，我們慶祝了，甚而至於我們大官小吏中間不少發了「勝利財」了；然而爲抗戰而犧牲的成千成萬的軍民同胞，他們的英靈得到了什麽安慰呢？我們國內自己又打了三年的仗，我們現在要求和平了，如天之福，和平果能一旦實現，我們又要慶祝了，說不定又有若干人要發「和平財」了；然而爲「解放」「戡亂」而犧牲的成千成萬的軍民同胞，他們的英靈又得到了什麽安慰呢？我們一念之轉，可以忽而戰，忽而和，而死者已不可復活！這些成千成萬的死者，都是「死而無告」的含寃之鬼！屬氣所　，安能有光風　月的世界？故條法禮懺，超度亡魂，看似消極，或近迷信，而其實天地間最平實的大事莫過於求一個心安理得。我們只想哀求和平，息目前的災，利自己的生，而忘却這大羣因「災」而已失其「生命」的同胞，使他們眞成了被遺忘者。問之於心；心安乎？求之於理、理得乎？上海儘有操奇計贏的富厚之家，他們樂善好施，積德行仁，一定對於息災法會有出於衷誠的贊助。</p>
<p>要之，一切法都是佛法，只須問其是否能使人得到大澈大悟的無上正覺而已。異此正覺的　提心者，必定能發大願，救衆生。故推此平等，救世。戒殺。度亡之心，我們自然不但要祈求眞正的和平，超度幽冥的亡魂，而且必須努力敎化靑年，轉迷成覺，有錢出錢，有力出力，孜孜於救濟貧病，扶掖難胞，慰勞榮譽士兵，獎助淸寒學子等等一切弘法利生的工作。使佛弟子在人們心目中有其尊敬的身份。這就需要像佛敎靑年會一類社團，起來負荷重大的責任。三十二年一月，大德虛　老法師在重慶獲國息災法會開示時，曾說：「現在人心不古，不知政敎之關係，於政以治身，敎以治心的意義，完全不懂。最近達識之士，多知目前大刦，非政敎合一，不足以救苦息災。」真的，我們要用政浩的方式解決國是，以求目前的和平；我們更須用佛法的眞理敎化衆生，以求永久的和平！</p>

<p>— 陳王允默</p>
<p>嗚呼布雷，君之於我，猶如明燈，亦類南針，而今明燈殞落，南針墜毀，我這一葉孤舟，面臨在洋，將何以續航？君自調「百無一用是書生」，世人竟以輔弼視君，推爲「當代完人」，孰知允僅小離數日，豈竟生機絕滅，乃遽以身殉，嗚呼痛哉！此後歲月，允自身甘苦，姑置不論，綜君生平，遺恨孔多，揮淚愴悼，洵百身莫膳已</p>
<p>允三歲失怙，三十失恃，百天而後，來歸于君，承君厚愛，敎導指示，無微不至，情好專一，煦和雍穆，親朋見慕久而彌欽。雖家計艱　，然履處則泰。今君中道捐葉，實命不猶，夫復何言？留此憂患餘生，度人間最痛苦的歲月，自己了無生趣；所以猶覥顏人世者，老姊身世孤苦，幼兒尙未成立，苟延殘喘，欲有以慰君在天之靈爾！</p>
<p>君年十六，卽失慈親，二十五歲，又這失怙，三十歲更逢琴瑟失調，其時子女五人，幼弟弱妹，又近十人，扶植敎導，俱集一身，家庭多故，形銷骨立，相見之初，心竊憂之。君自謂形體雖瘦弱，而先天尙厚，可望永年，且相者曾許古稀可期，喻解懇款，情摯言眞，但允終憂相者之說，事涉迷信，强弱壽夭，端賴攝生，奈因生不逢辰，時會多艱，事與願違，馴至回天乏術，溘然長逝！猶憶民國十五六年間，領袖簡拔賢良，君亦與焉。君嘗以一介書生，擢升要道，參與密勿，深懼殞越，貽誤國事，轉輾拘媿，耿耿在懷，輒願以新聞記者報効國冢，終因領袖禮遇有加，友朋敦勸備至，格於至誠，不欲過拂，遂涉宦途。人或有以新貴賀者，輒怫然不懌，歸則繞室徬徨，終宵無歡。迨九·一八事變而後，鑒國勢之艱處，懼大廈之傾覆，始毅然以「天下興亡匹夫有責」之明訓自繩，許身於國，夕惕朝乾，克己儉行，期分領袖憂勞，爭取國族光榮。凡親友往還，語不及私，間有以私事干擾者，輒多婉謝，退則又自責不近情理，失好親友。然而公私不能兩全，人天交戰，抑鬱寡歡，不可終日，允洞悉此情，從不以兄姊甥娃等事輕相頃累者以此。</p>
<p>明兒懷胎七月而生，初生十五年間，孱弱可慮，死生莫卜，幸護持在意，卒獲長成，竊嘗自喜。乃君終以宵　憂勞，不邊寗處，寖至體力不繼，選茲鞠凶！朝夕侍奉，卅載心力，略一疏忽，盡付東流，抱恨終天，追悔何及！歷檢君體臟器健全？然諸症嚴集，殆成宿痼，往往呻吟轉結，不能自解；値有要公，仍强自歛藏，奮然若失，故人多不知君病之深且危也。在君因責任心重，以爲身荷重任，終宜敬恭將事，自身病患，未暇計及，而不知病益不治。曩者先舅謝世，弟妹幼弱，屛棄一切，困心撫敎，不自計本身基業之成就。迨允來歸，屢經諷勸，其後四弟叔諒，亦漸知家業興替，乃始擺脫家務，專心國事。會逢國運累卵，憂憤交併，遂矢志奉公，竭己盡命，不敢少休。旣狷棄嗜好，復屛絕游樂，雖日盡十餘小時之工作，猶嫌力不從心。嗚呼人非鐵石，何堪苦思焦慮，長年顧悴，鞅當胼胝，盡日不足，如此公爾忘私，國爾忘身，今大局未靖，君已先自毀滅，賣志以歿，靜言思之，謂非時代之犧牲者，抑何可得？</p>
<p>友好知君荏弱，憂君辛勞，風示勿親細故，不知君思慮縝密，稽考周詳，撰擬文稿，每以作者身份說話，而以讀者感想下筆，耗竭心思已甚，而處理事務，必綜覈名實，其推利弊，月往往揣摩不良後果，預計應付步驟，以此恒自憾才力不稱，學識不足，耿耿孤懷，其何以自別於鄕愿？終因世風不古，同志難求，不敢身尸要職，有負領袖識拔，友好推崇，默默自了，結束一生，慘乎痛哉！允嘗私咎上蒼，旣賦君以志，曷更予君以健康，裨少有建樹，藉檔其願，如今飲恨終古，自聽湮沒，於世何補，於民何有，嗚呼痛哉！</p>

It is said that Mr. Dong offered several suggestions and asked him to forward them to the Nanjing government. Official circles are very optimistic about the peace talks, believing this to be the most important progress since the arrival of the Shanghai Peace Delegation in Beiping, but the details will not be known until the delegation returns.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 19th] According to sources close to Acting President Li, if Mao Zedong wishes to meet, Mr. Li will be happy to meet with Mr. Mao. It is said that Acting President Li has not yet considered meeting with Mr. Mao in person, but if invited, he will fly to Beiping to meet with Mr. Mao. The CCP's "People's Daily" in Beiping once stated that Mr. Li would be welcomed if he decided to come. After hearing the CCP's broadcast on the evening of the 18th, officials are optimistic about the future of peace and point out that this broadcast was "more reasonable in tone" than previous ones. It is noted that in this CCP broadcast, the CCP avoided using the terms "puppet president" and "puppet premier" for Li Zongren and Sun Ke for the first time.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 19th] Zhong Tianxin flew to Shanghai and then to Nanjing on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane at 3:15 PM on the 19th. Mr. Zhong is carrying a private letter from Premier Sun to Acting President Li and reporting on his trip to Hong Kong to negotiate with the CCP's South China representatives. Before taking off, Mr. Zhong told reporters that, based on his observations of the results of his trip to Hong Kong, the distance between the two sides in the peace talks has gradually narrowed. It seems the Communist side does not want to solve the whole problem by force, because they have controlled vast rural areas for more than ten years, and they feel they lack experience and cadres in managing cities. This may be one of the reasons why Zhu De has been slow to cross the Yangtze River. Mr. Zhong then spoke about the dissatisfaction of some people with the Sun Cabinet, saying that according to the constitution, if more than half of the members of the National Assembly participate and two-thirds approve a new policy, the cabinet can resign if it does not agree with this new policy. Otherwise, the Legislative Yuan has no power to demand the cabinet's resignation. Mr. Zhong also said that Premier Sun's blood pressure is still very high and he cannot go to Nanjing for the time being. If President Li needs him to return to Nanjing, he will also go. Mr. Zhong concluded that he will return to Guangzhou in a week and will not fly to Beiping until the CCP has made a formal statement.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Guangzhou, 19th] Wu Yuhou declared here on the 19th that the Sun Ke Cabinet will independently try to contact the CCP through Hong Kong to exchange views on the peace issue. I will go to Hong Kong on the 20th to convey Sun's views to the CCP officials there and ask them to forward them to the North China authorities. Some observers believe that Sun's move is an attempt to gain political support.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Zeng Zisheng Issues Statement, Denouncing Wu Yuhou's Words and Actions <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The remarks made by Wu Yuhou, a former representative of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, after flying from Shanghai to Guangzhou, have aroused dissatisfaction among other members of the delegation. Zeng Zisheng, the spokesperson for the delegation, issued a statement in Nanjing on the 19th, reiterating that the delegation has been dissolved, and denounced Wu Yuhou's purpose as "using the name of the delegation to contact the Executive Yuan and various parties, while other matters are not of his concern." The CCP has repeatedly broadcast in recent days, accusing those who oppose peace of undermining the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation. In fact, this "undermining" stems from Wu Yuhou's personal misconduct, which has led to attacks on Wu by other members of the delegation. Zeng Zisheng's statement stated that Wu Yuhou's words and actions in Hong Kong and Guangzhou have nothing to do with the delegation, and said: "Previously, there were three representatives in this delegation. My statement today can at least represent the opinions of most representatives such as Qiu Zhizhong, Deng Jiyu, Song Guoshu, and Xia Yuanzhi." Zeng denied the Associated Press report from Hong Kong on the 23rd that Wu Yuhou talked about the delegation's seven suggestions to the CCP, saying that they were all inconsistent with the facts. "The delegation's suggestions did not include Mr. Wu's claim that both sides' troops would retreat 40 li from their current positions and that the location for political consultation would be completely determined by the CCP. Other items were also mostly wrong and incoherent." Zeng also stated: "It is rumored that Mr. Wu has defrauded the government of a large sum of money, which has nothing to do with us."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] It is reported that the National Policy Research Association of Chinese University Professors will hold a meeting in Shanghai soon to re-elect the standing committee. Wu Yuhou's words and actions are also expected to be discussed.</p>

<p>Zhang Yaoming's Remarks at a Meeting in Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Zhang Yaoming, Commander of the Capital Garrison, attended the Nanjing Municipal Council at 10:00 AM on the 19th. In addition to reporting on the maintenance of security and military discipline in the capital, he also emphasized the importance of comprehensive peace. Zhang said that the atmosphere of peace has been rampant lately, but peace must be able to bring peace, and it must be comprehensive peace. Otherwise, it is surrender. Therefore, what we demand is comprehensive peace. If it is partial peace, it will become partial surrender. Nanjing has ample troops and the natural barrier of the Yangtze River. There is absolutely nothing to fear. Therefore, everyone should look forward and not look at those who are fleeing to places like Taiwan. The Kuomintang still has 90% of its potential. As long as everyone is determined to reform and unite, the comprehensive peace we seek will surely succeed.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Acting President Li Convenes Financial and Economic Officials to Continue Discussing New Economic Plan; Rumors of Bank and Money Shops Taking Holidays in Shanghai are Untrue <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Financial and economic officials continued to discuss the new economic plan in Nanjing on the 19th. Acting President Li convened Xu Kan, Liu Gongyun, and others on the evening of the 18th for a meeting that lasted until 12:00 AM. At 2:30 PM on the 19th, Acting President Li convened Xu Kan, Liu Gongyun, Pang Songzhou, and others at his residence to continue in-depth discussions on new economic measures. Xi Demao, General Manager of the Bank of China, was also invited to participate. Mr. Xi came to Nanjing from Shanghai with Xu Kan on the 18th. The meeting lasted for more than an hour. Xu and Liu visited Yu Youren and Gu Zhutong respectively in the morning of the 19th. At 1:30 PM, Xu Kan visited Yan Xishan, and they talked for nearly an hour. At 7:00 PM, Zhou Zhirou hosted a banquet for Xu and others.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, there were rumors in the market that the government would order banks and money shops to take a three-day holiday starting tomorrow and impose restrictions on withdrawals in order to implement the new economic plan. The reporter inquired about this matter from a person in charge of the Bankers Association, who said: "Absolutely not." If the government has such measures, it will definitely notify the Banking Regulatory Bureau and then the Bankers Association to inform the member banks and shops to comply. But as of tonight, the Association has not received any notice, and Director Bi Delin also said that he had not heard of it when he spoke with him. In my personal opinion, the rumor may be due to the closure of banks and money shops during the currency reform. Therefore, on the eve of the implementation of this new plan, the market has this speculation. However, if silver dollars are issued and the free trading of gold and silver is allowed, it is completely different from the nature of past currency reforms. Therefore, the holiday for banks and shops is unlikely to become a reality.</p>

<p>Rumors of Over 100 Billion are Groundless</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th] It is rumored that the total amount of Gold Yuan issued by the government has reached 80 billion yuan as of recently, or even over 100 billion yuan. The reporter inquired about this matter from a responsible person in the relevant authorities, who said: "The actual amount issued is about 20 billion yuan. External speculation is groundless." He further told the reporter that if the market price of gold is 100,000 yuan per tael, it is only equivalent to 200,000 taels of gold, while the government currently controls more than 4 million taels of gold, and other foreign exchange, silver, and materials are not included. The current depreciation of the Gold Yuan and the high prices are not entirely due to inflation. The main factor is the psychology of most people, which is caused by the instability of the overall situation. The financial authorities have drafted a complete plan to reorganize finances and stabilize the financial economy, which will be implemented soon. Finally, he told the reporter in a very firm tone that, from his personal observation, the current financial situation is not a problem in itself. The key is how to clarify the current situation and stabilize the people's hearts across the country.</p>

<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: According to the CCP radio station: The Beiping Public Security Bureau ordered the arrest of military figures related to the government on the 15th, the most important of whom was Zhang Yinwu. Zhang served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Hebei People's Army during the Anti-Japanese War and was good at guerrilla warfare, and was the "sworn enemy" of the Eighth Route Army at that time. Today, the CCP announced the reason for Zhang Yinwu's arrest, that he was carrying out military anti-communist plans in North China under the titles of "Director of the Enemy-Behind Guerrilla Mobilization Committee of North China and Director of the Pseudo-North China People's Self-Salvation Association." It is said that Zhang was captured by the Public Security Bureau at 9:00 PM on the 15th.

<p>[United Press, This City] The China Mission of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) issued a statement simultaneously in Peiping and Shanghai on the 19th. It was a letter from the ECA's North China representative, Davis, to Ye Jianying, Chairman of the Peiping Military Control Commission, protesting that eleven armed Communist soldiers had removed several bags of flour from a warehouse rented by the ECA at the Dutch Embassy. Although no violence was used, it could not be regarded as anything other than illegal occupation. The ECA was willing to hand over the flour to the Peiping Grain Ration Committee for distribution, provided that the Communist authorities issue a formal receipt, acknowledging that the flour would not be allocated to military and political personnel. As there was no formal receipt from the People's Government receiving authority, the flour had to be regarded as having been confiscated. It was hoped that the legitimate Communist authorities would promptly investigate upon receiving the report to seek a remedy. At the time the protest was being drafted, the illegal removal was still in progress.</p>

<h3 id="e25">From "He" and "Ke" to the Buddhist Precept of Non-Killing <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>— Written to solicit members for the Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly and the Buddhist Youth Association —</p>
<p>Everyone now longs for peace, not only we Chinese, but also the people of other countries all hope to end war and disarm, and live in peace and contentment. The reason why the United Nations was established is to try to create lasting peace for mankind. Peace is truly something that resonates in the hearts of people, a universally shared sentiment.</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last words when he was dying were: "Peace, struggle, save China!" In the thousands of years of traditional cultural nurturing, Chinese people have become peace-loving almost by nature. Confucius claimed not to have studied the art of war; Mencius said, "There is no righteous war in the Spring and Autumn period," and also said, "He who does not delight in killing can unify [the empire]"; Lao Tzu said, "Fine weapons are inauspicious." Even Sun Tzu, who wrote on the art of war, said, "War is a matter of great importance to the state, the ground of life and death, the way of survival or ruin. It is imperative to examine it." All this shows that the Chinese nation was nurtured and grew up in a culture of peace and not war. However, why is it that after years of war, everyone is appealing for peace at the top of their lungs, but peace still cannot be achieved soon?</p>
<p>I believe that "peace" is the opposite of war. War must involve both sides, so peace must also be felt as an urgent need by both sides. Both sides must have the grace of mutual understanding and concession, and both sides must have the idea of putting themselves in the other's shoes. Only then can we hope to get closer to it. In other words, to achieve the "harmony" of peace, we must first achieve the "balance" of peace. So how can we get closer to "balance"? We must earnestly start by approaching the "middle" path. The Doctrine of the Mean says: "The Middle is the great root of the world; Harmony is the universal path of the world. When the Middle and Harmony are attained, heaven and earth are in their proper positions, and all things flourish." Only with "Middle" can we avoid bias; only without bias can we have balance; only with balance can we have harmony. Therefore, if we want to seek peace by using the method of "either the East wind prevails over the West wind, or the West wind prevails over the East wind," then it will inevitably lead to cyclical retaliation, which will never end, and true and lasting peace may be difficult to obtain. The reason why Buddhists advocate "enmity should be resolved, not created" is probably because of this.</p>
<p>Amidst the calls for peace, the Yichou Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly for the Departed and Benefiting the Living has been held in Shanghai since February 15th, and all temples and Buddhist organizations across the country are also invited to practice Dharma together to relieve disasters. At the same time, the Shanghai Buddhist Youth Association is also starting its third membership drive today (the 20th), engaging in the work of propagating the Dharma and benefiting sentient beings. Some may think that in today's world of national affairs in turmoil and human lives as insignificant as ants, not engaging in some work to save the country and the people, but only advocating reliance on the Three Jewels and seeking help from the Buddha, is it not falling into passivity and bordering on superstition? In fact, this view is a secular prejudice and fails to truly see the true meaning of Buddhism. On the contrary, I believe that if the world's humanity wants true peace, it must promote Buddhism, especially starting with the precept of non-killing. As a novice Buddhist disciple, I would like to offer four humble suggestions.</p>
<p>First, Buddhism advocates perfect equality. Sakyamuni Buddha, as a prince, devoted himself to asceticism and cultivation, and after attaining enlightenment, he taught the Dharma for forty-nine years. His motivation was entirely to have compassion for all sentient beings and to save all sentient beings. The Buddha's intention was to advocate the equality of all sentient beings in the entire universe. Of course, the Buddha is the one to whom humans and gods turn to for guidance, but the Buddha teaches people to observe, understand their minds, and see their nature, so that everyone can truly know that, as the Avatamsaka Sutra says, "The mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings, these three are without difference." In other words, all sentient beings inherently possess Buddha-nature; all sentient beings can become Buddhas. Deluded, they are sentient beings; enlightened, they become Buddhas. Just think, among the sentient beings in the six realms of reincarnation, whether they are gods, humans, asuras, animals, hungry ghosts, or in hell, as long as they diligently cultivate, turn from delusion to enlightenment, they can all become Buddhas. With such a vast mind and thorough understanding, is there any doctrine in the world, past and present, that can surpass the teachings of Buddhism in emphasizing equality? Those who advocate class struggle naturally do not emphasize equality for other classes; those who advocate equality for all people in a country may not emphasize equality for other races; even if they further advocate equality for all humans, they naturally may not be willing to emphasize equality for sentient beings other than humans. Zhang Taiyan once said: "Emptiness is not the original intention of Buddhism; … The five precepts make people do good, … which is not unique to Buddhism; in my opinion, the meaning of equality, whether in this world or beyond, should all be regarded as the law, which is truly the superior aspect of Buddhism. … True equality means not only not having different thoughts towards all things, but also completely eliminating distinctions between right and wrong, good and evil. … Now in the era of the Republic, ranks have been leveled, but factional fighting is even more severe. If this way is used to help them, perhaps it can be done." Zhang's words in the early years of the Republic truly pointed out that Buddhism is the truth for saving the world for thousands of years. Now, to pray for peace, everyone must sincerely believe in the Buddhist teachings of equality, and never have the idea of "not a relative or friend" towards sentient beings (not to mention people towards people). Truly forgetting self and others, treating relatives and strangers equally, and then everyone sincerely repenting of all past evil deeds, working together in harmony, and starting anew with a peaceful and harmonious mind, will naturally attract auspiciousness, relieve disasters and end wars, and bring peace and prosperity to the country and the world.</p>
<p>Second, Buddhism advocates actively saving the world. Many people think that Buddhism talks about emptiness, teaches people to know that "the four elements are all empty," and takes "ending birth and death and leaving the world" as an ideal, thus denouncing Buddhism as being world-weary and destructive to humanity. I used to think so too. But after a little research, I realized that what I saw was seemingly true but not actually true. The true spirit of Mahayana Buddhism is the word "non-form." The Diamond Sutra says, "If one sees all forms as non-forms, then one sees the Tathagata." The most essential meaning of non-form lies in "non-self-form." The so-called emptiness of the four elements is as the Brahma Net Sutra says: "All earth and water are my previous bodies, all fire and wind are my original substance." It makes people understand that "my" body is transformed by the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind, and has no value to cling to. That is where the so-called "emptiness" lies. However, the Buddha wants to save the world and benefit sentient beings with the heart of great compassion, great mercy, great joy, and great equanimity. Therefore, Buddhism is definitely not empty and becomes "non-empty." Because of thorough "emptiness," one can completely forget oneself. A person with "non-self-form" will naturally not hesitate to sacrifice oneself at any time and in any place. Because of thorough "non-emptiness," one can make the great vow to save the world and benefit sentient beings, and perform the merit of sacrificing oneself for the benefit of others. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas all achieve the "worldly" attainment and fulfill the "worldly" great vows. The Buddha said: "I should go to hell. Not only go to hell, but also dwell in hell; not only dwell there permanently, but also always rejoice in hell; not only always rejoice, but also beautify hell." With such a compassionate great vow to save the world, there is truly no one more active than him. Buddhism teaches people to cultivate the six paramitas, and giving and patience are extremely important paths. If one can truly use the spirit of giving and patience to save the world and benefit sentient beings, and to seek peace, can peace not be achieved? (Continued on page seven)</p>
<h3 id="e26">Railway Freight, Postal and Telegraph Rates Adjusted Every Ten Days According to a Formula; New Rates for the Last Ten Days of the Month to Be Announced for the First Time Today <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 19th] Vice Minister Ling Hongxun of the Ministry of Communications announced to reporters today that the transportation and communication businesses under the ministry, except for aviation and water transport, which are self-sufficient and adjust prices at any time, railway freight and postal and telegraph rates have been subsidized by the government. Now that the national treasury cannot bear the burden, the expenses of various industries are often difficult, and crises occur frequently. In order to remedy this urgently, the ministry has specially formulated the latest formulaic adjustment method based on the National Enterprise Reorganization Law recently passed by the Legislative Yuan, and it has been approved by the Executive Yuan in its 44th meeting, ordering the ministry to conduct a trial run starting from the 21st of this month, and then submit the method and results to the Legislative Yuan. The method is as follows: (1) The new railway price is equal to the pre-war price multiplied by one-half of the current rice price multiple plus one-half of the coal price multiple. (2) The new postal price is equal to 5/10 of the pre-war price multiplied by the rice price multiple, plus 3/10 of the newsprint price multiple, plus 2/10 of the gasoline price multiple. (3) The new telegraph price is equal to 5/10 of the pre-war price multiplied by the rice price multiple, plus 3/10 of the newsprint price multiple, plus 2/10 of the electrical materials multiple. During the trial run period, the above prices will be reduced by at least 40% of the cost and will be adjusted once on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month, but if the price change does not exceed 20%, no adjustment will be made. As for the multiples of rice price, coal price, electrical material price, and newsprint price, the multiples of the prices of these items in the eight regions of Guangzhou, Kunming, Shanghai, Beijing, Hankou, Lanzhou, Guilin, and Chongqing will be investigated once on the 5th, 15th, and 25th of each month respectively, and the average price will be used as the benchmark for the multiple. Except for railway prices, which will be adjusted by region, the remaining new postal and telegraph prices will be announced uniformly on schedule. In addition, the first adjusted new prices will be announced in Guangzhou at noon on the 20th.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 19th] The measures for increasing postal, telegraph, and railway prices will be officially implemented from the 21st. According to Vice Minister Ling of the Ministry of Communications, this price increase is the most reasonable adjustment in the past. In the future, revenue and expenditure can be close to balance, and active improvements will be made to seek the welfare of the people of the country. The treatment of employees of transportation enterprises will also be adjusted.</p>

(2) It is noted that "land to the tiller" is the essence of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and it is also noted that Hunan and Zhejiang have successively proposed limited land ownership. Therefore, it is requested that the provincial government formulate a separate law for equal land distribution in the shortest possible time as an initiative for the provinces to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood.

Resolved: Passed. (5) The Presidential Office issued a clear order on January 28th to select Yu Jingtang and Yu Xilai as senators of the Council, which has no legal basis and should be withdrawn.

<h3 id="e47">US Government to Request Congressional Authorization for Military Aid to Western European Countries, Totaling Between 1 and 2 Billion, Seven Nations Confer on North Atlantic Treaty <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 19th Broadcast: Senior government officials stated that after submitting the Atlantic Pact to Congress, the US government will separately request foreign authorization to provide military aid to European countries. This case will be "global" in scope, and the Scandinavian countries will not be excluded from this assistance. The total value of this military aid will be between one and two billion US dollars. The wording and detailed contents of this case will depend on the changes in the situation in the coming months.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 19th Broadcast: Today, Acheson abruptly held an important meeting with the ambassadors of Canada and five Western European countries regarding the Atlantic Pact. A State Department spokesperson stated that this meeting was of an "informal" discussion nature, and its purpose was to inform these six countries of Acheson's negotiations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday. It is reported that in the previous meeting, Acheson requested that the obligations undertaken by the United States in the treaty should not mention the possibility of the United States providing military aid. However, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee believes that the pact does not need to explicitly stipulate that the US government would absolutely not use force if a signatory country is attacked. During the discussion of the pact, the United States pointed out that only Congress has the power to declare war, so the United States wants to emphasize in the treaty that each signatory country has the autonomy to decide what actions to take in response to armed attacks.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 19th Dispatch] The Secretary of State and key senators began jointly studying the North Atlantic Treaty on the 19th. Acheson delivered the initial draft of the highly confidential seven-nation pact to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for review last night. The committee did not raise serious objections to Acheson continuing negotiations on the original basis. This treaty, which aims to prevent European aggression, guarantees that the United States will take immediate action to assist any signatory country when attacked, but the question of what steps should be taken will be decided freely by each country. During the meeting, Senator Lodge and several other senators argued that the pact should be strengthened further. They urged Acheson to explicitly state in the pact that the United States would definitely use "overwhelming military force to counter any aggression." However, Committee Chairman Connally and Senator Vandenberg, the top foreign policy spokesmen for both parties in the Senate, warned that rigidly stipulating the obligation to participate in the war would cause the pact to lose supporting votes when submitted to the Senate for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Sweden Deeply Fears Being Drawn into the Cold War, Becoming a Second Turkey, Foreign Ministers of the Three Nordic Countries Discuss Joint Defense <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Oslo, 18th Dispatch] The foreign ministers of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark discussed the issue of Scandinavian defense on the 18th, and Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen also participated in the talks. It is understood that the main issue of the talks was Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange's visit to Washington to discuss the Atlantic Pact. Swedish Foreign Minister Undén and Danish Foreign Minister Hertoft came here to attend the Norwegian Labor Party Congress because they are the leaders of the Labor Parties in their respective countries. Well-informed sources believe that the Labor Party Congress will agree with the cautious attitude adopted by the Norwegian government towards the Atlantic Pact.</p>
<p>[Associated Press New York, 18th Dispatch] Sweden fears that Norway will become Turkey, adding a new term to the Cold War. It is said that what Swedish officials fear is that if Norway signs the North Atlantic Treaty, the Soviet Union will not only take diplomatic measures, but also station troops on the border to threaten Norway, forcing it to mobilize its troops, leading to economic exhaustion and increased dependence on foreign aid, thus increasing the burden on the United States and creating another chain reaction in the Cold War. The fear is that the Soviet Union's demonstration against Norway will involve Sweden itself, that is, the Soviet army will occupy the Finnish Åland Islands facing the Swedish capital, tantamount to pointing a pistol directly at the heart of Sweden. In this way, Sweden will also become Turkey. Driven by the pressure of expansionists, the Soviet Union forces other countries to spend huge sums of money and implement military and economic mobilization, placing the whole world in Turkey's position. Whether this move is intentional is unknown, but from the Soviet Union's standpoint, its effect is to weaken the capitalist economy. According to Communist dogma, as this effect deepens, it can cause capitalist countries to kill each other due to forced competition, leading to collapse, and the Communist Party can reap the benefits without effort and carry out a world revolution. The Soviet Union had anticipated this when Western countries moved towards World War II. On the one hand, it signed a neutrality treaty with Germany, without which Hitler would not have dared to invade Poland; on the other hand, it signed a non-aggression treaty with Japan, without which the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor would not have occurred.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Montreal, Canada, 18th Dispatch] Arctic explorer Stefansson said today that the Soviet Union's development of the Arctic is far more advanced than that of the United States. Currently, the Soviet Union has at least six cities within the Arctic Circle, each with a population of one million. Canada and Alaska have only two bases within the Arctic Circle, each with only 300 people. The Soviet Union's development of the Arctic proves its pursuit of a defensive strategy to evacuate the industry of major cities to safe locations in wartime. Although Soviet Arctic cities are not comparable to fortresses, they are undoubtedly equipped with good airfields.</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 19th Broadcast: When the House of Lords meets next Wednesday, questions will be raised to the government: What steps will the British government take to deal with the progress of the Communist Party in Southeast Asia? At that time, Monckton and Bridgeman will report on the new developments in the Far East and request the government to strengthen defense in the Far East.</p>
<p>Upper House members will question the government on whether it has sufficient troops in the Far East to deal with the situation in Malaya and "possible incidents" in Hong Kong. According to the view of Upper House member Douglas, there may be two threats to Hong Kong: one is the possibility of riots and sabotage actions within the territory, and the other is the invasion by external enemies from the border of the leased territory. Intelligence sources have compiled detailed reports on the Communist Party's invasion of Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, Malaya, and other countries, and stressed that the Communist activities in various places are almost entirely under the control of Chinese.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Moscow, 18th Dispatch] The appointment of former US Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has attracted attention from Soviet newspapers. Most newspapers commented that the appointment is related to the US government's plan to establish a General Staff to handle European aid affairs. It is expected that Eisenhower will soon visit Greece to help strengthen the defense of the Mediterranean region. In addition to paying close attention to the situation in the Scandinavian Peninsula, the newspapers are also very concerned about the Mediterranean and Middle East regions, believing that the United States is trying to win over Middle Eastern countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan to participate in the future North Atlantic Alliance, to reconcile Mediterranean countries such as Italy with Spain, and to request the trusteeship of Tripolitania.</p>

<p>[Associated Press London, 18th Dispatch] The British Commonwealth is brewing a new dominion in Southeast Asia. According to British Colonial Undersecretary Williams today told the Associated Press reporter: This matter is a long way off, but it is definitely in the plan. The new dominion will occupy 132,692 square miles and have a population of nearly six and a half million. The Malayan Federation, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo, and Brunei are already included. Hong Kong may also join.</p>
<p>The new Southeast Asian dominion is of great importance to British and American economic relations. The area produces the most important raw materials, and many raw materials are not found elsewhere. Rubber, tin, oil, pepper, coconut, and sago are part of the output, and Sarawak also has gold mines. In political terms, there is something more important than economics, that is, the autonomous government can give a real blow to communism. According to Williams, Britain is not paying lip service and is sincere in supporting the independence of Southeast Asia. The Southeast Asian dominion will be the eighth British dominion, and its position is the same as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, or Ceylon.</p>

They are fighting from elaborately built bunkers and have very long tunnels that encircle a vast area. They carry the latest automatic weapons and resist the government forces by relying on modern warfare tactics learned from the British army in the last war.</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Gu Yuchun, General Manager of China Textile Construction Company, issued a written statement in response to the report on the 19th that the factory directors of the company had jointly applied to Acting President Li and the Supervisory Yuan for a thorough investigation of Liu Weichi, chairman of the company: After seeing the report yesterday morning, I immediately telephoned the factory directors to inquire about the matter. According to the factory directors, there was no joint report to Acting President Li and the Supervisory Yuan. Among the points mentioned in the report, regarding the 18 million yuan surplus of the company in 1948 that was transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the 8 million yuan that was remitted to Nanjing, and the 10 million yuan that was returned, were returned to the Guangzhou office of the company by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, instructing it to be directly turned over to the national treasury. In addition, regarding the houses rented by the executive directors and secretaries of the board of directors, they were rented by the company in accordance with normal procedures. The company did not bear the cost of repairing and painting Liu Weichi's official residence, as well as the daily expenses of the official residence. As for the other points, such as renting guest houses in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, they are also untrue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch] Regarding the case reported in the newspapers that the factory directors of Textile Construction Company accused Liu Weichi, chairman of the company, of abusing his power and suspected of corruption, the company authorities explained as follows yesterday: 1. Temporary advances In the past month, after the Executive Yuan decided to evacuate the engineering staff to work elsewhere, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce followed the decision of the Political Council and began to evacuate. Because of the urgent timing, it was proposed to borrow funds temporarily from Textile Construction Company to cope with the changes. The company authorities entrusted the Bank of China to remit funds to Beijing in batches. However, when the funds arrived, the main personnel of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had already left Beijing, and the remittances were not received and were returned. 2. The cost of repairing houses was paid by the board of directors. Before Liu took office, the private residence had been in disrepair for many years, so it was simply repaired. All expenses were paid by Liu himself. The statement that the cost was paid by the board of directors is not true. 3. Directors and secretaries received huge amounts of money for housing. The houses were rented by the company authorities and allocated to various members for residence. The so-called receipt of housing expenses is not true. 4. Abuse of private power. The executive directors are elected by the board of directors in accordance with the regulations. The so-called designation is not true; the appointment of Lu Weipu as acting deputy general manager was because another deputy general manager was on sick leave and was recuperating elsewhere. In order to prevent the company's business from being interrupted, it was decided by the board of directors to invite Chief Engineer Xu Weipu to act concurrently; as for other staff members, the increase to more than 30 people is even more untrue. The quota of staff members on the board of directors is not so large, and there are only eleven people working now, which has not increased compared to before. It is also learned that the inside story of this matter is purely a personnel dispute.</p>

Since this method was submitted to the municipal government for approval and implementation, the performance of collecting fees on behalf of the government in various dance halls has been quite good. However, the restaurant and cafe industries have refused to obey orders and have not collected additional fees to date. The Civil Affairs Bureau has recently sent a letter to the municipal government requesting it to order the police bureau to order the restaurant and cafe industries to collect fees on behalf of the government in accordance with the law. If they continue to refuse, they will be resolutely suspended from business.</p>

<p>Northeast residents in Shanghai believe that the Northeast Remaining Materials Inspection and Handling Committee mishandled the distribution of relief funds, and the distribution was unfair. People from all walks of life in the Northeast, including National Assembly representatives, legislative supervisors, and military and political figures, jointly launched an investigation committee. They requested the government to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the malpractices and urge prompt, reasonable, and legal emergency handling. After investigation, it was found that there was a remaining balance of 38 million yuan in the National Bank and a batch of cotton yarn mortgaged to the bank. In addition to the declared freeze, it is now known that the government has sent Deputy Director Liu Zhe of the Control Yuan and eight Control Committee members, including Ni Bi, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday to start the investigation. In addition, the investigation committee has now completed its task, and future affairs will be incorporated into the Northeast Residents Association in Shanghai for overall planning.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Mayor's Cup: Zhi Chao Eliminates Leader with Two Goals; Qing Bai Jing Wu to Meet Today <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The fourth Mayor's Cup football match kicked off yesterday. In the first match, Long Tou played against Zhi Chao at Yiyuan. As a result, to the surprise of 2,000 spectators, Zhi Chao fought hard and eliminated Long Tou 2-0, advancing to the second week. Zhi Chao scored two goals in the first half, and there were no goals in the second half. Zhi Chao's young players fought bravely yesterday and worked exceptionally hard. Wu Qixiang sat in the center, completely shattering Long Tou's offensives time and time again. It can be said that Long Tou's forwards could hardly cross the border.</p>
<p>Long Tou attacked first but did not gain anything. Zhi Chao counterattacked. Shang Shiqi advanced quickly along the side and passed to the center. The ball fell to the left, and Yu Qiaxing passed to the right. Qian Yuanqing shot fiercely from 25 yards out, and the ball went straight into the upper right corner of the goal. Gao Weichen was stunned and didn't know what to do. Zhi Chao took the lead and their morale was greatly boosted. Long Tou, inexplicably losing this goal first, launched a fierce counterattack. Zhang Jiliang and Yao Qingsheng shot from near and far, high and low, but none of them hit the target. Zhi Chao's defense line, under the leadership of Wu Qixiang, was as solid as a rock. Jiang Kun penetrated deeply, forcing a corner kick, but it was also ineffective. After half an hour, Yan Chengkuan was injured and left the field, and Wang Burong replaced him. Zhi Chao's Zhu Jiazheng entered along the side again, and Wang Baoshan was unable to stop him. The ball passed to the center, and Yu Qiaxing slid to the ground and scored again. In the first half, Zhi Chao took a 2-0 advantage.</p>
<p>In the second half, the two teams reunited. Long Tou replaced Yao Qingsheng with Zhang Quangen. Zhi Chao, with victory in hand, took a defensive stance and moved the entire army back, thus forming a tug-of-war. Xu Dawei was injured and Xu Guoping replaced him. Jiang Lei committed a foul, and Wang Baoshan took the penalty, but there were no results. Zhi Chao gradually showed signs of fatigue, and Long Tou wanted to advance but had no way. When the whistle sounded, Zhi Chao eliminated Long Tou 2-0.</p>

More than a thousand spectators enthusiastically supported the Hualian vs. Huili match. Huili took the lead in the first half, and the new troops participating in the war were in better spirits. Yongfang and Fuhai launched continuous attacks, and the two sides were in a difficult and indistinguishable state. In the first half, Huili led by three points with 26 to 23. In the second half, Hualian went on a frenzy of points, and only then did they gradually get into shape. Finally, three Huili players were sent off for five fouls each, leaving only four players to fight, committing old problems, and the overall situation was lost.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Professors from Ten National Colleges and Universities Accuse Acting Minister of Negligence, Publish Letter to the Public Full of Sadness and Anger <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The professors' association of ten colleges and universities, including National Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Jinan University, Tongji University, Shanghai Business School, Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Wusong Merchant Marine College, Kindergarten Normal College, and Tangshan Institute of Technology, jointly published a "Letter to the Public" yesterday. Between the lines, it is full of sadness and anger. In addition, there is a letter to newspaper offices across the country to be forwarded to compatriots from all walks of life, which states: "We are publishing a letter to the public because the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education are in a state of panic and dispersal, ignoring our lives, and there is no way to appeal. I have investigated that the salaries of the current officials are the same as those of public education personnel. If there is no improper income, they should have the same miserable fate as us, but in fact, some of them own a large amount of gold notes, and some have widely established land and mansions in cities at home and abroad. The level of enjoyment on weekdays exceeds that of ancient emperors. Even the same civil servants and public tea servants of state-owned financial and enterprise institutions monopolized by them have monthly salaries that are many times higher than ours and are sufficient to be looked at. It seems that this kind of style of enriching oneself by鑒雙 and destroying teachers with a policy of starvation, the measures are absurd, and there is no precedent in history. You will also feel indignant when you hear about it. Please give your support and jointly appeal, and I cannot thank you enough."</p>
<p>Letter to the Public The original text is as follows: We are professors from national colleges and universities in Shanghai. We have dedicated ourselves to university education for many years, and only want to do our best to educate the next generation of young people. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we were displaced and suffered hardships, which is what Chinese citizens should have endured. Unexpectedly, after the victory, the government authorities not only did not pay attention to improving our lives, but also failed to reform the currency system, allowing the currency value to fall again and again. The salaries issued to us were discounted more and more severely, making it impossible for us to maintain our lives. Our base salary is 600 yuan per month at the highest, and 240 yuan per month at the lowest. The salaries of lecturers, teaching assistants, and staff are even lower. Taking the highest level as an example, after deducting two discounts, based on a 15-fold calculation, we get 2,070 gold yuan coupons per month, which is only the market price.</p>
<p>About one silver dollar</p>
<p>Even this amount, because the Executive Yuan left Beijing in a hurry and no one was in charge, I don’t know how much it will be worth when it gets into our hands. In terms of what we get right now, it is not enough to buy two pecks of rice, and it is not enough to buy one and a half catties of vegetables per day. The annual income is not enough to pay for the current monthly water, electricity, and gas needs. Even with the total allocation of three pecks of rice, it is not easy to support one person. Where can we talk about "supporting our parents and raising our children", let alone sending our children to school? We educate other people's children, but we are forced to let our own children drop out of school. What is more unfair in the world than this? As for the so-called academic research fees, 50 yuan per month for professors and 40 yuan per month for associate professors is not enough to buy a copy of the day's newspaper. The Shanghai Municipal Government announced that the living index for the first half of February was 349 times, but we don’t know what ours is. Our opinion is that we should issue our original salaries in full and without any discounts, according to the Shanghai price index on a regular basis.</p>
<p>After the Sun Cabinet was established</p>
<p>Not only did it shelve the proposal to adjust the salaries of public education personnel submitted to the Legislative Yuan for execution, but also after the acting minister of education took office, he remained deaf to the appeals of the presidents and professors of national universities in Shanghai. Before the Communist guns were heard in the capital, acting minister Chen Xueping had already fled to Guangzhou with money. He only cares about the peace of mind of a few high-ranking officials and cruelly leaves millions of people in the academic community starving and freezing. He is truly derelict of his duties and has no regard for education. If it were not for this time, representatives went to Beijing to ask for assistance,</p>
<p>I managed to get 100 million to return</p>
<p>It would be difficult for the academic community here to survive, but it is still a drop in the bucket. We were forced to make a special announcement to the public, so that the world would know the crimes of dereliction of duty and the reality of our hard work in maintaining our livelihood. I dare to ask for a common rise to request President Li and the two legislative chambers to impeach them separately in accordance with the law, and at the same time urge the Executive Yuan to quickly follow the Legislative Yuan's resolution to adjust the salaries of public education personnel, and issue them in full and without any discounts according to the local price index every half month, and reasonably adjust the research fees, and at the same time follow the example of Nanjing and quickly issue the contingency expenses according to the adjusted salary amount to appease public anger and relieve the suffering."</p>

<p>Schools Ask the Central Bank to Overdraft at 75 Times</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The presidents of various national colleges and universities in this city previously sent a joint telegram to the Ministry of Education Chen on expenses and sought to resolve them. In the absence of a solution, the presidents of all the colleges expressed their intention to resign. Chen has now replied by telegram to persuade them to stay, and said that he is doing his best to find a way to deal with expenses. The presidents of all the colleges believe that the reply is still empty and there is no specific solution. The Professors' Association held a meeting on the 18th and decided to ask the presidents of all the colleges to go to Guangzhou to urge the adjustment of salaries and the realization of the allocation of contingency funds. To this end, the presidents of all the colleges are studying the appointment of representatives to go to Nanjing or Guangzhou next week to personally request a solution.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The presidents of national colleges and universities expressed their gratitude to the Central Bank for its assistance in allocating funds to the colleges, and yesterday hosted a joint reception at the Sino-British Cultural Association for the heads of the Central Bank's Business Bureau and Treasury Bureau. In order to solve the current financial difficulties, all colleges have asked the Central Bank to approve an overdraft of 75 times.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the case of the robbery and murder of Leonard, the British plant director of Ewo Brewery, the defendants Sun Xianglin, the main culprit, and Wang Kemou, the accomplice, were transferred to the District Court by the Special Criminal Court. Yesterday, Judge Zhai Zhaoping concluded the trial and sentenced Sun Xianglin and Wang Kemou to life imprisonment each for jointly robbing and causing death. Zhang Zhenqiu and Wan Jinfu, the recipients of the stolen goods, were transferred to the District Procuratorate for re-investigation due to procedural irregularities. The defendant Sun Xianglin in this case was originally a worker at the Ewo factory. Later, he was fired for some reason. Knowing that Leonard was wealthy, he conspired with Wang Kemou and Zhang Yongxing, Wang Dongyuan, Chen Linfu, etc., who were at large, to sneak into Leonard's private residence over the wall late at night on February 24 last year, bound Leonard and his wife in the room, and searched extensively. They robbed a large amount of US dollars, gold jewelry, and clothing. When they were about to leave, Sun was angered by Leonard's struggle for help. Sun killed Leonard by hitting him with a beer bottle, and then escaped back the way they came. Later, the police arrested Sun and the other two and transferred them to the Special Court for trial. Later, the Special Court was ordered to be revoked, so the case was transferred to the District Court for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Stock Exchange to Officially Reopen Tomorrow; In Addition to Stocks, Gold Bonds Also to be Auctioned <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The city's stock exchange, which has been closed for six months, has now decided to officially reopen tomorrow. After the reopening, the exchange has decided to auction stocks (including state-owned and private enterprise stocks) and short-term gold bonds. For the private enterprise stock section, in addition to the 34 types already listed before August 19, Zhenhua Paint Company will be added starting tomorrow. The remaining three companies, World Book Company, Pudong Electric, and the Municipal Ferry, will also be listed gradually in the near future. For the state-owned enterprises section, Taiwan Sugar Corporation is expected to be listed tomorrow, while Taiwan Paper is in the process of being listed. China Merchants Bureau will decide after consulting with the Ministry of Transportation, and China Textile Construction Company is rushing to complete the listing procedures. If they can complete it in time, they can also be expected to be listed tomorrow; otherwise, it will be delayed for two days. Trading of stocks will be temporarily limited to the morning session, from 9:30 AM to 12:30 PM daily, except for holidays. Short-term gold bonds will be auctioned as soon as the Ministry of Finance delivers the bond samples and can be traded as one-day futures. The auction time is divided into morning and afternoon sessions. The morning session time is the same as for stocks, and the afternoon session is from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. The stock exchange will also reconcile accounts with brokers every day starting at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Gu Shanchang, the general manager of the exchange, specially convened a discussion with the directors and supervisors of the Brokers Association at 10:30 AM yesterday to exchange detailed opinions on various trading technical issues after the reopening.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM yesterday, General Manager Gu held a press conference at the exchange. In addition to reporting on the suspension of business on August 19 and the process of this reopening, Mr. Gu said, "Since the closure of our exchange, all rumors and rising prices have not decreased or disappeared due to the closure of our exchange. This proves that the stock exchange market is only affected by rumors and rising prices and is not responsible for creating rumors or leading prices. This reopening is entirely in accordance with the government's decrees, and the task of the stock exchange has also been clearly pointed out as 'The government is allowing the Shanghai Stock Exchange to reopen to channel idle funds and stabilize the economy.'" Mr. Gu concluded, "My principle in handling affairs has always been to be practical and realistic, and I will never deviate from the facts when speaking or acting. I hope that all sectors will offer more guidance."</p>
<h3 id="e97">Gold Bond Lottery to be Held on March 2nd <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that the first lottery for the return of principal and payment of interest on gold bonds will be held on March 2nd. The National Bank will announce the date and require purchasers to exchange their reservation tickets for official bonds. Yesterday, the price of gold bonds rose again by 2,000 yuan, totaling 77,500 yuan per tael. Gold bond sales have been sluggish, with only over one hundred taels sold daily. Regarding the repeated increase in the listed price of gold bonds, relevant sources explained that there are two purposes: one is to encourage members of society to purchase gold bonds, so the price of gold bonds is rising faster than the black market price of gold; the second is to absorb a large amount of idle funds by increasing the price of gold bonds. Because gold bonds are currently all reservation tickets, they are not yet listed. It is said that the Ministry of Finance has limited the exchange for official bonds to before March 2nd, so the official listing and auction of the official price will be in early March.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Improvement of Import/Export Management Measures Awaits Executive Yuan Approval <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Listed Price Rose Another 2,000 Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Report] Improved import and export management measures have been drafted and will be announced once approved by the Executive Yuan. The main points of the new plan are to open up self-provided foreign exchange, implement import and export chains, and within a certain limit, the government will not interfere with import and export goods. Appendices one, two, and three, as well as quotas, will be abolished. The mediation of import and export will still use foreign exchange transfer certificates. At the same time, to encourage exports, the foreign exchange settlement for exports to the government will be reduced from the previous regulations to 20% or 30%.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Monetary Conditions Gradually Stabilizing <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the weekend, and the trend of monetary conditions in the city turned stable across the board. The supply of funds in the market was strong due to the stabilization of prices in recent days, and the interbank lending rate remained high, leading to the release of goods for interest. Demand, on the other hand, turned scarce. The interbank lending rate in the market was around 80 yuan for same-day lending in the morning, but it generally decreased near noon, hovering around 70 yuan, and even 60 yuan was offered.</p>
<p>Cash remained scarce yesterday. External demand did not decrease, while internal supply remained low. Bank notes were even more popular, with discounts firmly at 6 to 8 yuan per 100 yuan. The limit for banks and merchants remained at 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. The cash shortage is unlikely to improve in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Cotton Yarn Soars; Cloth Market Listless <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The opening price of cotton yarn soared because the rumor of opening up southern transportation was strong, and monetary conditions were easing, so people's hearts were greatly encouraged. Cantonese merchants were seen to be buying smoothly, and local Qing merchants also flocked to absorb it, and the situation was quite booming. Each yarn started a fierce rise, resulting in a stronger increase of 20% compared to the previous one.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 580,000 yuan all the way to 640,000 yuan at the close, soaring by 140,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 135,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at 450,000 yuan in the morning and finally stood firm at the 500,000 yuan mark, squeezing up by 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse, which had appeared from a low of 330,000 yuan to 310,000 yuan, recovered to 370,000 yuan at noon, finally rising by 70,000 yuan, and was quoted at 400,000 yuan on Monday. 20-count Double Horse rose by 65,000 yuan. Other brands such as Golden Rooster and Jincheng also rose by about 70,000 yuan. 16-count Guangming opened at 275,000 yuan in the morning and broke through the 300,000 yuan mark at noon, reaching a high of 310,000 yuan, an increase of 65,000 yuan compared to the previous one. Other yarns also advanced rapidly towards the peak.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth continued to be sluggish. Although monetary conditions showed signs of easing, people's hearts also turned upward, but because both local and out-of-town merchants had no intention of buying, there was only a "ping-pong" market inside. The market had been raised higher under the pull of the holders, but it fell tired due to the clearing of actual sales. At the closing, it was reported that the price of cotton yarn had risen by about 20%, and the market price was reported to have rebounded, but it was still squeezed smaller than before.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth was initially quoted at 15,000 yuan outside the market, but it was traded at 1,400 yuan near noon. Labatong fine cloth retreated from 11,000 yuan to 11,000 yuan, finally falling by 600 yuan. Da Shuanglong fine cloth was 10,400 yuan, with no difference from before.</p>
<p>Sijunzi yuan serge opened at 12,700 yuan and then made small sales down to 11,600 yuan. It recovered to 12,200 yuan at noon, slightly down by 50 yuan. Sijunzi yuan straight tribute finally stood firm at the original level of 12,000 yuan from the previous day. 190 high-grade Shilin cloth factory opened at 33,500 yuan, flowered serge at 15,000 yuan, and Sijunzi yuan government silk at 15,000 yuan. The market atmosphere turned strong in the afternoon, and it was reported that Sijunzi yuan serge was quoted at 14,500 yuan outside the market.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Rice Prices Trend Hovering; Flour Soars; Oil Market Rises Sharply <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice price rose and then fell back. The market trend remained hovering. After the market opened, the price of gold notes became smaller again, and people's hearts were calmed. In the middle of the day, monetary conditions suddenly turned loose, and importers absorbed them one after another. Actual sales were smooth, and the market was profitable. Bai geng and Bo dao once rose to 11,000 yuan, but in the late market, they fell back by 400 to 500 yuan due to too much selling by lenders. They were finally squeezed up by 200 to 300 yuan compared to the previous ones. It is estimated that Bai geng was 10,300 yuan, Bo dao was 10,500 yuan, Zao dao was 10,300 yuan, and Te geng was 10,700 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market price rose sharply, because monetary conditions turned loose, and Northern merchants purchased in large quantities, and people's hearts turned firm. At the beginning of the market, Bingshan broke through the 4,000 mark, and the closing price was as high as 4,200 yuan. After the closing, retail investors absorbed quite strongly, and the market price rose again. At the close, the price was as high as 4,400 yuan, which was half a percentage higher than the previous one. The old car was 4,500 yuan yesterday, and the market price outside the market was 4,650 yuan. Hongfeng, Jiancheng, and Dafa all tended to rise, and bran also rose by a percentage. Fuxin large bag was 3,350 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains</p>
<p>Yesterday's market trend was first flat and then firm. In the early market, the financial weakness outside the circle made people's hearts sluggish, and all parties held a wait-and-see attitude. The market trend continued to be tired and flat. Later, it was heard that the rice market had rebounded, and also because of the end of the month, the market atmosphere suddenly vibrated, and retail investors took the opportunity to absorb it. So soybeans turned tired and became firm, and Pinghu merchants traded the most. Che dou opened at 7,800 yuan at the close, and the factory absorbed it frequently, and it rose to 8,500 yuan by noon. The rest of the market was prosperous. Corn fell by 200 to 300 yuan in the early market due to the silence of Qing merchants and unsmooth actual sales. Later, the bean market rebounded, and Huangdu closed at 3,600 yuan at noon. Shengren also rose by a percentage. Yangzhou goods closed at 2,200 yuan. Hongliang also broke through the fourth level, closing at 4,200 yuan at noon.</p>
<p>Edible oil Yesterday, the cloth rose sharply, because the raw material soybeans rose, and the previous day's decline was too strong. Holders had no intention of selling, and monetary conditions also turned loose. All parties' suction power was not weak, and under the hype of the out-of-town merchants, the market price rose step by step. Soybean oil rose by 45,000 yuan in the early market, and people's hearts were greatly shaken. At noon, it closed at 48,000 yuan, which was 8,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Jiangbei raw oil also rose by 7,000 yuan compared to the previous day, closing at 52,000 yuan. Raw rapeseed oil also rose to 44,000 yuan, which was 8,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Soybean cake was not willing to show weakness due to the sharp rise in the oil market. People's hearts were shaken, and the suction power was strong. The market price suddenly returned to the old price. Yesterday's market generally rose by about 30%.</p>

<p>Since the Taiwan authorities stopped commercial remittance between Shanghai and Taiwan, people are paying close attention to the situation of Shanghai-Taiwan trade. According to a senior member of the financial community who just returned to Shanghai from Taiwan yesterday, although commercial remittance between Shanghai and Taiwan has been suspended, commercial exchanges can still proceed as usual. Generally, merchants trading with Taiwan now mostly adopt a barter method, that is, transporting goods from Shanghai to exchange for goods produced in Taiwan. This method is now quite popular, and trade is quite developed. The goods transported from Shanghai to Taiwan are mostly cotton textiles, fertilizers, and various industrial products. The goods transported from Taiwan to Shanghai are mostly sugar, coal, fruit, and various local products. The second method is to obtain remittance funds, which is also quite popular in the financial community. Banks or commercial firms in the two places offset each other by clearing accounts. Therefore, Shanghai-Taiwan trade can still proceed as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Artificial Silk Slightly Recovers; Silk and Satin Market Weak <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The artificial silk market stopped falling and rebounded yesterday. The monetary conditions in the market eased, the hidden interest rate fell back, the price of gold outside the industry also rebounded, and the market price of foreign exchange certificates continued to rise, and people's hearts rose. The initial opening price of 120 Bright New Goods was 420,000 for the current day. After the opening, there were frequent news outside the market, and the environment was favorable. Moreover, due to the return of hidden interest rates, retail investors bought in groups, and the market price soared. At noon, the next-day price was 520,000. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>The transfer certificate of raw silk rose sharply. Exports have already shown signs of improvement. Foreign firms are about to move after being silent, and their buying is slightly increasing. The internal sales price is also optimistic. The holders hold on, and the monetary conditions in the market have eased. Various goods outside the circle have stopped falling and rebounded, and people's hearts are rising. The noon price of premium Lingzu was 570,000, which was 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day's noon price.</p>
<p>Due to the soaring raw materials and the rising price of gold outside the silk and satin circle, people's hearts have changed. The morning price of the Meiya quilt cover was 300,000, and the buying was still strong after the price was called. The price rose by 20,000 yuan in an instant. Afterwards, various merchants sold at high prices, and the buying dissipated. The market conditions turned weak, and the asking price was seen to be lower. The lowest price was 290,000. Near the close, it was heard that the closing prices of various goods outside the circle had risen sharply, and the market trend was good. However, because it first went high and then came back, the foot was weak, and the rising momentum was coming to an end. As a result, the noon price was 310,000. No asking price was heard in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>

<h3 id="e106">From Peace to the Buddhist Precept Against Killing (Continued from Page 2) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Third, Buddhism advocates universal non-killing. The reason we want peace is that war makes living beings suffer. Human war is the extreme of human mutual killing. Chinese war is the extreme of Chinese compatriots killing each other. We know the pain of killing, so we call for peace; then do other living beings who are killed not suffer? To whom do they appeal? Imagine, every day, thousands upon thousands of cattle, sheep, chickens, pigs, and all other animals with life and breath are slaughtered. They all have life, they all have consciousness, and they are innocently killed. How can they not harbor resentment? Lu Fangweng's poem: "The taste of dripping blood and flesh is considered precious, everyone suffers the same pain and grievances cannot be expressed. Put yourself in their place and think in your heart, who would be willing to cut themselves with a knife?" Chan Master Yuan's verse says: "For thousands of years, envy in the bowl, the grievance is as deep as the sea, and the hatred is difficult to calm. If you want to know the catastrophe of war in the world, just listen to the sound of the slaughterhouse at midnight." Now, let's not talk about the principle of cause and effect and retribution, but just imagine that we humans rely on ingenuity to kill the lives of animals every day to satisfy our own desires and are not surprised. Then, among humans, each competes with ingenuity, the strong bully the weak, and the masses abuse the few, to the point where the flames of war fill the sky. People will inevitably regard it as nothing, and perhaps even use the theory of "survival of the fittest" to excuse and cover up their faults. Therefore, if the killing of animals does not stop, it will inevitably lead to people killing each other; if people killing each other does not stop, it will inevitably lead to animals fighting for human flesh. Recently, in the war zone, the dead soldiers and civilians have not been buried and have been pecked at by birds and beasts everywhere. The reason for this can be deeply thought about. Moreover, in a prosperous city like Shanghai, even during wartime, there are many refugees and wailing everywhere, and there are places where delicacies cost tens of thousands of gold per table. How can it be that the vast majority of the population is on the verge of death, while a few wealthy people can still indulge in luxury and enjoy their own desires? Therefore, the starting point for eliminating disasters and praying for peace should be to strive for non-killing. (Which naturally includes not being addicted to killing people.) I heard that the initiators of the Shanghai Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly once sent letters to the municipal government and the Senate, requesting a three-day ban on slaughter during the 49-day Dharma Assembly, in order to invoke auspiciousness and harmony. I think this is a very meaningful thing. Even if it is necessary to supply meat to the garrison troops, it is also good to ban slaughter one extra day each week, allowing the wealthy citizens to save a large amount of pork to transfer to the soldiers' needs, which can also reduce the killing karma of Shanghai citizens. Even if the municipal government is not considering promoting Buddhism, it should also consider the difficulty of material resources and use the method of stipulating the date of the ban on slaughter to force frugality!</p>
<p>Fourth, Buddhism advocates respectful repentance for the deceased. The teachings of Buddhism originally recognize that "all phenomena arise from the mind," so the attachment of the mind at the moment of death is the root of reincarnation in the six realms. Because of this, if we want to benefit living beings and eliminate disasters, we cannot forget the soldiers and civilians who have already died because of war. King Wen's administration of benevolence must first be applied to the poor and helpless people in the four categories of widows, orphans, and the lonely. But we must know that there are also ghosts who have "died without being told"! We fought an eight-year war against Japan, we won, we celebrated, and even many of our high and low officials made "victory money"; but what comfort did the heroic spirits of the thousands upon thousands of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for the war of resistance receive? We have fought our own war for three years, and now we are asking for peace. As blessed by Heaven, if peace can be realized one day, we will celebrate again, and perhaps some people will make "peace money" again; but what comfort will the heroic spirits of the thousands upon thousands of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for "liberation" and "suppression of the rebellion" receive? With a turn of our minds, we can suddenly fight or suddenly make peace, but the dead cannot be resurrected! These thousands upon thousands of dead are all "ghosts of the dead who have not been told" who hold grievances! With the spirit suppressed, how can there be a world of light and beauty? Therefore, rituals of repentance and salvation, transcending the souls of the dead, seem passive or close to superstition, but in fact, the most simple and practical thing in the world is to seek peace of mind. We only want to beg for peace, to eliminate the current disasters, and to benefit our own lives, but we forget this large group of compatriots who have lost their "lives" because of "disasters," making them truly forgotten. Ask yourself in your heart; is your heart at peace? Seek it in reason, is it reasonable? Shanghai has many wealthy families who are skilled in winning profits. They are happy to do good deeds, accumulate virtue, and act with benevolence. They will definitely sincerely support the Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly.</p>
<p>In short, all dharmas are Buddhist dharmas, and we only need to ask whether they can enable people to obtain the supreme enlightenment of great enlightenment. Those who have the mind of Bodhi other than this true enlightenment will definitely make great vows to save sentient beings. Therefore, by extending this equality, we can save the world, abstain from killing, and transcend the dead. We will naturally not only pray for true peace and transcend the souls of the dead, but also strive to educate young people, turn delusion into enlightenment, give money if we have money, give strength if we have strength, and tirelessly engage in all kinds of work that promotes the Dharma and benefits living beings, such as relieving poverty and illness, helping the needy, comforting honorary soldiers, and awarding scholarships to poor students. Make Buddhist disciples have a respected identity in the eyes of the people. This requires organizations like the Buddhist Youth Association to rise up and shoulder heavy responsibilities. In January of the 32nd year, the virtuous Master Xu Yun said at the opening ceremony of the National Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly in Chongqing: "Now people's hearts are not ancient, and they do not know the relationship between politics and education. They do not understand the meaning of governing the body with politics and governing the mind with education at all. Recently, many enlightened people know that the current catastrophe cannot be saved and disasters cannot be eliminated without the unity of politics and education." Indeed, we must use political means to solve national affairs in order to seek current peace; we must also use the truth of Buddhism to educate sentient beings in order to seek permanent peace!</p>
<h3 id="e107">Mourning Bu Lei <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Wang Yunmo</p>
<p>Alas, Bu Lei, to me you were like a bright lamp, also like a compass needle. Now that the bright lamp has fallen and the compass needle has crashed, what will I, a lone boat facing the ocean, use to continue sailing? You often called yourself "a useless scholar," yet the world viewed you as an assistant and counselor, and regarded you as a "perfect man of the times." Who knew that just a few days of separation would lead to the extinction of your life force, and you would suddenly sacrifice yourself? Alas, how painful! In the years to come, I will put aside my own suffering. Looking back on your life, there are many regrets. Shedding tears and mourning, I truly cannot repay you with a hundred lives.</p>
<p>I lost my father at the age of three, and my mother at the age of thirty. A hundred days later, I returned to you, receiving your deep love, teaching, and guidance in every detail. Your affection was single-minded, your warmth and harmony were admirable, and your relatives and friends envied and admired you more and more. Although the family finances were difficult, you always lived in peace. Now you have left halfway, which is truly a matter of fate. What more can be said? I am left with a life of worry and suffering, spending the most painful years in the world, and I have no interest in life. The reason why I still shamelessly live in the world is that my elder sister is lonely and bitter, and my young children have not yet grown up. I am lingering on my last breath, wanting to comfort your spirit in heaven!</p>
<p>You lost your beloved mother at the age of sixteen, and your father at the age of twenty-five. At the age of thirty, you encountered the disharmony of the zither and se, when you had five children, young siblings, and nearly ten people to support, teach, and guide, all on your own shoulders. The family had many misfortunes, and you became thin and weak. When we first met, I secretly worried about you. You claimed that although your body was weak, your innate constitution was still strong, and you could hope for a long life. The physiognomist had also promised that you could expect to live to seventy, your explanation was sincere and your words were true, but I was still worried that the physiognomist's words were superstitious. Strength and weakness, longevity and short life depend on health preservation. However, because you were born at the wrong time and the times were difficult, things went against your wishes, and you were unable to recover and passed away suddenly! I still remember between the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China, the leader selected virtuous and talented people, and you were also among them. You once rose to an important position as a scholar, participating in confidential matters. You were deeply afraid of failing and delaying national affairs, and you were troubled and uneasy, always wishing to serve the country with a career as a newspaper reporter. However, due to the leader's courtesy and the earnest persuasion of friends, you could not overly disobey their sincerity and entered the officialdom. Some people congratulated you as a new dignitary, but you were often angry and unhappy, pacing around the room when you returned, without joy all night. After the September 18th Incident, seeing the difficult situation of the country and fearing the collapse of the mansion, you resolutely restrained yourself with the clear teaching that "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world," dedicating yourself to the country, being vigilant in the evening and working hard in the morning, being self-disciplined and thrifty, hoping to share the leader's worries and strive for the glory of the nation. Whenever relatives and friends came and went, they did not talk about private matters, and those who interfered with private matters were often politely declined. Then you blamed yourself for not being reasonable and losing good relatives and friends. However, public and private affairs could not be balanced, and people and heaven fought, making you depressed and unhappy, and unable to live a day. I understood this situation and never lightly burdened you with matters of siblings, nephews, and nieces.</p>
<p>Ming'er was born in the seventh month of pregnancy. For the first fifteen years after her birth, she was weak and worrying, and her life and death were unpredictable. Fortunately, you took care of her carefully and she finally grew up. I secretly congratulated myself. However, you always worried day and night and could not be peaceful, until you eventually became unable to continue your physical strength and chose to leave this world! Serving you day and night, thirty years of effort, a slight negligence, all flowed to the east, regretting it to the end of the world, regretting what to do! I have examined your organs and found them to be healthy? However, various symptoms were severely gathered, almost becoming a chronic disease. Often, you groaned and twisted, unable to relieve yourself. When there was an important business, you still forced yourself to restrain and hide it, and you appeared as if nothing had happened. Therefore, many people did not know that your illness was deep and dangerous. You had a strong sense of responsibility, thinking that you should always be respectful and respectful in your important task, and you did not have time to consider your own illness, but you did not know that the illness would become more and more incurable. In the past, when my late uncle passed away, my siblings were young and weak, so you abandoned everything and worked hard to teach them, without considering the success of your own career. When I returned, I repeatedly persuaded you. Later, your fourth brother, Shuliang, also gradually realized the rise and fall of the family business, so you began to get rid of family affairs and concentrate on national affairs. You met the country's crisis, and worries and anger intertwined, so you swore to serve the public, doing your best and exhausting your life, not daring to rest. You had already given up your hobbies and cut off your amusements. Although you worked more than ten hours a day, you still felt that your strength was not enough. Alas, people are not iron stones, how can they withstand hard thinking and anxiety, long-term haggardness, and hard work? All day long, it was not enough. You were so selfless, forgetting your body for the country. Now that the overall situation has not been settled, you have already destroyed yourself, selling your ambition to die. Thinking quietly about it, how can it not be said to be a sacrifice of the times?</p>
<p>Friends knew that you were weak and worried about your hard work, and they showed you not to be involved in trivial matters. They did not know that your thoughts were meticulous, your research was thorough, and you drafted your manuscripts, always speaking from the author's point of view and writing from the reader's feelings, exhausting your mind. When dealing with affairs, you must synthesize the name and reality, and when you push the advantages and disadvantages, you often speculate on the bad consequences and plan for the response steps. For this reason, you always regretted that your talent and knowledge were not worthy, and your lonely heart was always there. How could you distinguish yourself from the village fool? In the end, because the world's customs were not ancient and it was difficult to find comrades, you did not dare to hold important positions, failing the leader's recognition and selection and the praise of friends. Silently ending your life, how tragic and painful! I once blamed the heavens in private, since you were given ambition, why not give you health, to help you achieve a little success and achieve your wishes? Now you regret it forever, and you will be buried forever. What is the benefit to the world, and what is there for the people? Alas, how painful!</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Wujin, 17th] Changzhou Provincial Middle School has some school property and farmland located in Dingtiao Township, Jiangyin. Xu Shousheng was entrusted by the school committee to collect rent every year. Last year, Zhou Zhaoxi, the head of the township, sent someone to Changzhou to urge Xu to go to the township to collect rent. Xu was originally wary because of the poor security in the township, but he was happy to go after being urged by Township Head Zhou. With Zhou's assistance, the rent collection was quite effective. Subsequently, Zhou threatened Xu to pay ten shi of rice slips to avoid trouble. There were also more than three shi of rent rice and more than 4,000 jin of grain collected. Just as they were about to be transported, Township Head Zhou again used threatening words to recommend Xu Guangfeng Grain Store in a nearby small town. This year, when they went to collect the grain, they found nothing. Recently, Yang Jiayou, the principal of the school, sent a special envoy to Cheng County to request the county government to severely punish Zhou Zhaoxi, the township head, for intimidating and extorting rent rice and grain.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] After the Hehui Township Cooperative in this county was bankrupted by Zhou Shunjia, the Yue Miao Town and Zhang Ze Town Cooperatives were also once liquidated before resuming business. Now, the Sanjing Township Cooperative outside the East Gate has also reportedly gone bankrupt due to losses. The bran and chaff stored in the cooperative have been sealed by the authorities, and the board of directors of the cooperative is handling the registration of creditors and debtors. The working capital has all been lost, and the amount of debt is also quite large. Manager Yu Shunkang has already left the cooperative and gone elsewhere.</p>
