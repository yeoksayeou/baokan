<h3>李代總統改今飛桂　昨在穗致祭黃花崗烈士　呼籲全國團結渡過難關</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿一日電〕李代總統廿一日晨九時，由余漢謀，薛岳，歐陽駒，鄭彥棻等陪同往調黃花崗七十二烈士墓獻花，孫院長趕往時，李代總統等已致祭畢，在歸途中相遇，十時李氏在中山紀念堂萬餘羣衆中出現，旋卽作半句鐘之訓話，重申對和平努力決心。氏並呼籲全國人士加强團結，渡過難關，氏推崇蔣總統此次引退大仁大勇之精神，爲全國同胞所敬佩。最後，並提出任何黨派應尊重全國人民對和平之要求，窮兵讀武者，終必失敗。李氏午應余漢謀，張發奎，薛岳，歐陽駒之聯合歡宴於迎賢館，下午三時留穗立委集會，邀請李代總統報吿和談進行經過，五時李代總統在官邸約見蘇，美，巴，英，印，法，義，緬，捷，荷，菲等國使節，各代表歡談。李代總統並因尙有政務須與孫院長共商，改廿一日離穗飛桂巡視，留一二日經湘，漢返京。</p>
<p>〔合衆社廣州廿一日電〕李代總統携有孫科之答覆返京，無論孫氏願意參加和平運動或堅持在廣州，此一答覆究意是何仍未獲悉。廣州報紙對李代總統之訪穗之評述表示悲觀，但此是否反映官方意見則不能斷定。此間官方「廣東夜報」對李氏之意向加以讚塲，但懷疑共方之誠意。</p>
<h3>國共須彼此壓抑感情　用理智考慮人民要求　李代總統在留穗立委歡迎會致詞</h3>

<h3>青島局勢局勢已澄清　秦德純本週內前往履新　一元化局面有實現可能</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島廿一日電〕關係方面悉：秦德純遲遲未能來靑履新，原因（一）過去中央對靑島之地位舉棋不定，（二）秦氏正力爭將馮治安劉汝明部增調靑島，以鞏固防務。靑市局勢刻已澄淸，固守原則無問題，馮劉北調當可實現。據悉，秦氏本週內來青，此間市府招待所已粉刷一新，以迎秦氏</p>
<p>〔本報靑島廿一日電〕消息靈通人士對記者稱：目前尙無充分理由證明靑市須採取緊急措施，（一）外園共軍兵力薄弱，毫無積極企圖，膠東數百里内平靜無事。（二）國軍最高司令部並未將靑島此一着棋完全下定，至少在一週前已作新的考慮。（三）必須進行之撤退工作，在形勢上自早須着手，至於美軍之「撤退」與否，刻已有事實說明，不必再予討論，美軍「調動」工作，在上月下旬卽已可稱結束，但仍依舊維持軍艦駐舶海港及宣佈駐留極少數人員，以表示其並未「撤退」之意義，除非靑島易入共軍手中，此項意義將繼續存在，美軍絕不能幻想於共軍手中使用靑島軍港，故非至最後在任何情形下，決不隨便應用「撤退」字樣，以觀察局勢之變化。該人士又稱，藍姆賽曾對中外記者於報導中應用「撤吉爾一再强調應用「調動」字樣事，似相符合。至於國軍方面，軍眷之撤退工作，大致已吿完成，綏區一部人員有隨南去者，軍方解釋此舉目的爲解除前方將士之顧意，但工業及軍事物資之南移以及軍政金融等機關之緊縮，或無形解散，將使靑島逐漸成爲純軍事據守性質。一部份地方人士相信察德純氏來青後，則一元化之局面大有實現可能。該人士又稱：軍事當局於接獲某種命令後，曾一度正式公開向各有關機關負賣人表示靑市未來局勢之趨向，旋卽將前義加以保留，靑市秩序因此緊張混亂達數日之久。記者獲悉：此舉使有關機關—尤其是金融業如中央銀行等感到迷離，蓋彼等如非獲得確切指示，卽不易統籌其業務，活潑經濟命脈，但最近數日已大見緩和，申匯貼水迅速縮短，市况亦漸趨正常。靑市中央機關之撤退部署，數月前卽已着手，但並非由此間最高軍政機關指示下進行。該靈通人士最後吿記者稱：靑市目前實頗安定，各種推測與顧慮均言之尙早而無益於實際</p>
<h3>中蘇進行談判　美方表示關心</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕官方消息，廿日報吿稱，美國對目前中蘇的交涉極表關心，此種交涉可能給予蘇聯在中國西北的長期開礦及貿易等權，報吿者稱，此種會談如獲成功，則將使新疆省併入蘇聯勢力範圍內，並違反去年十一月中國政府所批准之中美商業條約中之條款。此間對在新疆省會正進進行之中蘇會談知悉極少。但中國方面報吿稱，此種會談將使簽訂四十至五十年之協定，給與蘇聯開採金·銀·銅·鐵。煤及其他礦物之權。又有報吿稱，新疆省藏有大量鈾礦。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>從明眞諦事件說起</h3>
<p>美國駐匈牙利公使査賓奉召返國述職，本月十八日道出巴黎，向各報記者發表談話稱：「匈牙特別是政府仍在繼續逮捕羅馬天主敎徒，余自匈國行抵巴黎，呼吸法蘭西自由空氣，殊感愉快。至於匈國國內情形，實不堪想像，非筆墨所能形容。凡在匈國境內之人，除非盲目者，均不難看出，匈國人民在共產黨的完全控制之下，均不知其生活像個什麼樣子。」我們對於東歐鐵幕以內各國的實際情形，向來不十分淸楚，就是對於匈牙利樞機主敎明眞諦之受審判，在不明眞相之前，也稍持保留態度，不欲輕加判斷。但時至今日，我們綜合了各方面的情報，眞相已經大白，同時保加利亞政府報紙也宣佈，將有牧師十五人因有叛國及間諜罪受審，我們實在再不能不加以評論。因爲照這樣剝奪信敎自由的作風推演下去，在中國天主敎基督敎的許多主敎神父牧師，以及佛敎的許多佾侶也都有在中共統治區内遭到同樣命運的可</p>
<p>明眞諦樞機主敎是於去年十二月廿六日在伊士特貢城被匈國政府加以逮捕的。據該國政府所發表的公報，被捕的罪名有二：（一）從事間諜活動，企圖陰謀背叛政府；（二）非法賣買外國貨幣。同時被捕者尙有六人。當其時因爲案情複雜，外界均不明眞相，但匈國政府企圖根除天主敎在民間的勢力，是昭然若揭的。所以，巴黎和梵蒂岡聞訊之餘，無不震驚，而希望匈國政府早日審訊，俾使此案水落石出。</p>
<p>但匈國政府遲遲復遲遲，至本年二月初才開始審訊。在第一庭開庭的時候，檢察官忽然舍本逐本，對於上述二罪嫌竟不訊問，反而說明眞諦曾在獄中，秘密致函美國駐匈牙利公使査賓請其授手援溺，乘飛機逃出匈國。明眞諦回答時聲音低微，答語模糊，庭上即宣佈其已經「直認不諱」。匈國檢察官此舉的用意，是非常明顯的；一言以蔽之，乃在擴大此一事件，由匈國國內的事件一變而爲具有國際性的事件。二月五日續開檢察庭，英美人士要求旁聽，旣遭匈國當局的拒絕，英美政府提出抗議，也置之不理。所以，凡是具有正義感的自由份子，莫不替明眞諦樞機主敎担憂：果然，未及一二日，匈國檢察官即宣佈此案成立，提出公訴，要求處以死刑。他們所依據的理由：一明眞諦領導某種組織，陰謀推翻匈牙利政府，從而援助哈布斯堡王室復辟；並預期第三次犬戰即將爆發，故與美國特務人員接觸，而美國久欲在經濟上政治上操縱匈牙利，所以明眞諦之行動，實以帝國主義組織爲背景，助長美國支配世界」。</p>
<p>這個公訴遞到了匈國人民法庭，稍加訊問，乃於二月八日宣判，將明眞諦判處無期徒刑，並沒收其全部財產。匈國政府這種蠻橫不法的行爲，幾乎要引起世界各國的公憤；不僅巴黎和凡蒂岡表示不滿，而且倫敦和華府也十分憤慨。英國下議院議員聞訊後，立即訪問貝文外相，要求英國政府正式向匈牙利提出抗議；美國朝野的輿論更是充滿了激昂的情緒。就是在匃牙利人民，也大不以爲然，國內因受共產黨的嚴密統治，固無法表示其反對的意見，但在國外的匈牙利人，對於這種不人道而反宗敎的行動，均作有形的抗議。匃國駐紐約領事巴拉薩的憤而辭職，就是一個絕好的證明。</p>
<p>即使不站在「宗敎自由」的立塲上，看到匃牙利政府這樣迫害天主敎徒，也是不能不表示同情明眞諦主敎的。近年來，蘇聯的共產政府雖然也有准許人民可獲宗敎自由的表示，但是看了明眞諦事件，就可以恍然大悟，在鐵幕以內，「宗敎自由」完全是共產黨的自欺欺人之說。美國務卿艾契遜曾於二月九日向報界發表談話，指斥匃國迫害敎會，他說。，「此舉實爲蘇聯操縱下之匈牙利政府不顧天良迫害敎會，以求去除其反共的道德力量。」又說：「匈牙利人民實已無眞正之自由可言。」艾契遜國務卿的談話，最爲中肯，杜魯門總統也表示贊同。所以明眞諦事件的本身，雖已經過去，但此一事件的後果，足以影饗世局者正在發展之中，可能加深東西兩個世界的裂痕。我們但願全世界愛好自由的人們，對於此一違反「宗敎自由」的事件，都能多多警惕。</p>
<p>其次，現在有許多人對共產黨存着幻想，以爲鐵幕之內眞有自由，因而在中共近來軍事發展順利之形勢下，也對中共所宣傳的如何一民主一「自由」，存着若干希望。甚至美國記者或敎會人士，最近也常常報道各地中共當局似尙不十分迫害敎會。我們當然也秉着「與人爲善」的心情，希望中共不致完全關在蘇聯鐵幕以内，希望他們的作風與東歐各國共黨有所不同。然而，誰又能保中共在控制地區穩定局面以後，不抄襲匈牙利和保加利亞等國共黨的老文章呢？</p>
<h3>美援棉恢復運華　首批下月初抵滬</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處上海訊〕賴樸翰親自發動恢復以美棉花九萬五千包援助中國紡織業，此項運動，已吿順利完成，經合總署華盛頓總部頃宣佈，此項美棉之裝運，將立卽重新開始。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿日電〕經濟合作總署政策主要決定人今日在此宣稱；美政府現正考慮延至七月一日決定任何對華經濟援助新計劃之可能性，經合署大約將在三月初以臨時援華計劃提交國會，其數額俟經合署赴華委員團主任霍夫曼下週初返抵華盛頓後，再行決定。</p>

<h3>關於北大西洋安全公約　英不堅持軍事保証　七國談判可望順利進行　挪威決定加入該約瑞典大感失望</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市男子籃球隊出征國外，數見不鮮，而女子籃球隊出國遠征者，除從前兩江女子籃球隊曾渡海東征，後趕者尙無其人。綠隊女子籃球隊執本市半耳者有年，其球藝與造就，實駕當年兩江而上之，威名遠播海外。菲律賓爲東方籃球之基地，亦震於錄隊之名，頗有邀綠隊南征之意，是爲綠隊征菲之說所由來。馬尼拉靑年會新屋落成，去冬岷埠僑胞領袖羣聲領隊林珠光會致函本市籃球委員會主席錢旭滄，請組隊前征。錢氏當卽介紹綠隊應聘，但該隊大部球員非因職業牽制，卽因學業關係，遲遲未能成行。據聞菲方留港代表曾函托本市球員蔡金典，向錄隊接洽。蔡君提　二個辦法：（一）由蔡本人任敎練，（二）錄隊中錄收球負九人，其餘由蔡君另行選聘，此事未能獲得錄隊方面同意。近聞又有旅滬僑胞數人，以港方女籃球隊之號召力頗大，如能出國，當更有厚利可圖，正積極進行按洽球員。球藝之外，球負外表亦爲條件之一，則其組隊出國之用心，對女子體育之風氣，實大有疑問。將來出國請求許可之時，深盼本市體育協會及籃球委員會當局，予以愼重考慮。卽使將來果由錄隊出國，對於陳容之支配，菲島當地女子籃球情形，男女規則之採用等等，事前菲有縝密計劃與訓練，決不能草率從事，以本市代表隊身份出國，不得不如此也。</p>

<h3>證交復業第一日　成交廿一億餘股　美亞新光等漲停</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市證券交易所昨日芷式復業，金融界龍往道賀者頗衆·九時卅分前，二〇四家經紀人陸續進塲，九時卅分振鈴，交易開始。以叫價單位稍有變更，交易稍形紊亂。交易情形，並朱如理想中之旺熱·結果有行市叫開者僅廿三種，漲達限度者有大通·新光·景福·景綸·新亞·永安·新華·台糖等八種·至中午十二時卅分收盤。下午三時卅分起，證交開始與各經紀人對帳，一小時後對畢，對帳經過情形尙佳。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕證券交易所第一日復萊，計做開民營股廿二種，國營股台糖一種，共計成交廿一億餘股。內台糖佔做四五四股，永紗七五二〇〇〇〇〇股。市勢先堅後軟，初開因銀根鬆弛，行情較爲混亂。永紗初開卽做二元六角三分，圈中扳抬不已，最高曾進抵三元關。新光內衣·勤興衫襪·華豐搪瓷·新華百貨等，皆吿漲停板。十時許情形始趨正常，圈中「亨鼠」居高思危，大多轉吸反吐，永紗卽下瀉，呈一面倒現象，收盤爲二元三角。國營股只台糖有開出，初開卽成漲停板，做一萬二千一百元。景福衫襪初開一角四分，最高一角六分半，最低一角四，收盤一角三分半。美亞綢廠七角二分開出，一躍而升至八角六分漲停板，收盤稍回，做七角九分。閘北水電五角有進，市呈堅中帶軟。</p>
<h3>中央造幣廠　開鑄銀幣</h3>
<p>每元重量七錢一分八</p>
<p>盛傳已久之改革幣制，業經某金融權威人士予以證實。行將問世之新幣爲銀幣，式樣與二十三年度所發行之舊銀幣相同，卽正面爲孫中山先生像，背面爲帆船。該銀幣之成色與袁大頭不相上下，重量爲七錢一分八。茲據有關方面透露，中央造幣廠可能自本星期起開鑄銀幣，至流通市面，尙須等待一相當時期。蓋幣制之改革，必須行政院正式通過。現政院遠遷廣州，對此重大事項之決定，事實上不無許多困難，故尙須時日云。</p>
<p>外傳中央造幣廠正　造半圓銀幣之說，茲據確息，實爲一元銀幣之誤。記者曾於昨日五時向央行有關當局訊問，據稱銀幣之鑄成，卽作新經濟改革之用，關於新經濟方案，尙須得到各方面之同意後，始能實施。</p>

<h3>黃金公債掛高　昨售出數量奇少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕黃金短期公債，昨晨中央銀行牌價定爲每兩八萬二千五百元，計提高七千元，又上週末本市經售行局，共售出公債票面黃金四百九十九兩五錢。又黃金公債昨日僅售出三十五兩，實爲空前微小之銷售額。</p>
<h3>細紗略秀　布市新買頻起</h3>
<p>紗市昻後卽回，蓋晨初開市聞銀根鬆弛，故人心仍好，買氣依然旺盛，市乃續形堅秀，近午市上銀根轉緊，黑赤迫跌，圈外物品亦受阻力，人心渙散，散戶紛紛脫手，臨收情况趨虛，結果細紗脚地尙堅，微露秀色，粗紗則呈榮辱互見之勢。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳自六十八萬元步降至六十五萬元收市，較週末略升一墓元。四〇支藍鳳挺一萬五千元，三二支銀月僅好起五千元，以五十萬〇五千元結東。</p>

<p>綢緞昨日市况先挺後軟，走勢恍惚，初開金價疾升，人心趨堅，市上生氣蓬勃。繼聞金價猛退，華股高後卽回，買氣轉淡，美亞初做三四五〇〇〇元，卽漲二成左右，嗣後業外金鈔猛回，人心轉淡，惟因生絲人絲激漲，喊價欲小不小，午收時仍在原價站住，午後市勢平軟，銀根寬中稍緊，金鈔市價亦無好面，走勢軟弱，喊價小落萬五千元。</p>
<h3>茶市供求失調</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，交易奄奄一息，賣戶以存底將罄，兼以自上週末，圈外物資復起蠢動後，故心思迭堅，供應猶豫，是以供求依然失調卒難順利做開，而過程趨佳，脚地並無岌岌可危之象。</p>
<h3>桐油上升</h3>
<p>桐油昨市，出口國外雖仍岑靜，而國內春銷，漸見蠕動，故買氣尙佳，交易蟬聯。至査趨勢，除各貨到源滯狹，旣吿不斷進展外，同時外匯移轉證，一再上漲，亦能激動人心，是以吐納互做價，較上週飛晉五千至一萬元不等。</p>

<h3>Acting President Li Changes Flight to Guilin Today; Yesterday Paid Tribute to Huanghuagang Martyrs in Guangzhou; Called for National Unity to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou Twenty-first Dispatch] Acting President Li, accompanied by Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, Ouyang Ju, Zheng Yanfen, and others, went to the tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang at 9:00 AM on the 21st to lay flowers. President Sun rushed there, but Acting President Li and others had already finished paying their respects. They met on the way back. At 10:00 AM, Mr. Li appeared among more than 10,000 people in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and immediately gave a half-hour speech, reiterating his determination to strive for peace. He also called on people across the country to strengthen unity and overcome difficulties. He praised President Chiang's spirit of great benevolence and courage in resigning, which is admired by compatriots across the country. Finally, he proposed that any party should respect the national people's demand for peace; those who resort to military force will ultimately fail. Mr. Li attended a joint banquet hosted by Yu Hanmou, Zhang Fakui, Xue Yue, and Ouyang Ju at Yingxian Hall at noon. In the afternoon, representatives of the Legislative Yuan stationed in Guangzhou held a meeting, inviting Acting President Li to report on the progress of peace talks. At 5:00 PM, Acting President Li met with the envoys of the Soviet Union, the United States, Pakistan, Britain, India, France, Italy, Burma, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and other countries at his official residence, and the representatives had a pleasant conversation. Acting President Li, due to outstanding political affairs that needed to be discussed with President Sun, changed his itinerary to fly to Guilin for inspection on the 21st, staying for one or two days before returning to Nanjing via Hunan and Hubei.</p>
<p>[United Press Guangzhou Twenty-first Dispatch] Acting President Li is carrying President Sun Ke's reply back to Nanjing. Whether Mr. Sun is willing to participate in the peace movement or insists on staying in Guangzhou, the content of this reply is still unknown. Guangzhou newspapers expressed pessimism about Acting President Li's visit to Guangzhou, but it cannot be determined whether this reflects official opinion. The local official newspaper, "Guangdong Evening News," praised Mr. Li's intentions but doubted the sincerity of the Communist side.</p>
<h3>The Kuomintang and the Communists Must Restrain Their Emotions and Consider the People's Demands Rationally; Acting President Li's Speech at the Welcome Meeting of Legislative Yuan Members Staying in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou Twenty-first Dispatch] Acting President Li reiterated his confidence in peace at a welcome tea party for Legislative Yuan members staying in Guangzhou on the 21st, resolving to plead for the lives of 450 million people with 100% sincerity, and willing to endure humiliation and bear burdens, doing his best to achieve peace. The welcome tea party was held at Dongyuan, Dongshan, at 3:00 PM. More than 70 Legislative Yuan members attended. After Vice President Liu Jianqun delivered a brief welcome speech on behalf of the hosts, the acting president rose to speak amidst enthusiastic applause. He first stated that due to certain political affairs that required his personal handling in Nanjing after the Executive Yuan moved to Guangzhou, he regretted not being able to come to Guangzhou earlier. He then explained that the government's decision to pursue peace was purely to comply with the national people's will to abhor war and desire recuperation. The acting president also analyzed the objective situation at home and abroad in detail. Because the people of the whole country and even the people of the whole world unanimously demand peace, although difficulties and setbacks are unavoidable, he firmly believes that the achievement of peace is still possible. If all parties and factions can restrain their emotions and make good use of reason, peace will surely be achieved in the end, allowing our country to embark on a path of construction. The acting president recalled that after experiencing eight years of war against Japan, our country was followed by three years of fratricidal strife, the people's livelihood was devastated, and the whole country was plunged into deep water and scorching fire. The people were in great pain and all hoped for an end to the war and the disbandment of troops. In order to comply with public opinion, the government decided to seek peace with the greatest sincerity and effort. Although efforts to promote peace are inevitably met with some difficulties, the general trend is that one day it will be achieved. The government and the people within its domain certainly yearn for peace. Even the people in the Communist-controlled areas deeply feel the pain of war and all eagerly hope for peace. Public opinion cannot be violated, so he firmly believes that the Communist Party must have considered the necessity of a ceasefire and peace talks. Looking at the international situation, peace and construction are the unanimous demands of all people in the world. The civil war in our country is ostensibly only a domestic political problem, but in fact, it is closely related to the safety and security of the whole world. However, the affairs of the Chinese people must be solved by the Chinese themselves. Since war cannot solve the problem, it should be solved by political methods, striving to talk everything out at the table, instead of resorting to arms. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have accumulated grievances for twenty years, and there is bound to be some resentment in their emotions. However, fratricidal strife is the most unfortunate thing and must be restrained with emotion, using reason to consider the demands of the people and accepting the demands of the people, sincerely seeking the realization of peace. The acting president finally reiterated his personal attitude, saying that he had been in the military for a long time, knew the cruelty of war deeply, and abhorred war. He was unwilling to resort to force except for the sake of protecting the country and defending the people. This peace negotiation was by no means for the sake of the government or himself, but to seek peace for the 450 million compatriots across the country. If this causes any misunderstanding or setbacks, he will definitely endure it. We must endure for the sake of 450 million people in order to achieve peace and achieve the goal of pleading for the people. The Legislative Yuan members who attended the tea party included Liu Jianqun, Gu Zhengding, Jiang Yiping, Zheng Yanfen, Qi Shiying, Shao Hua, Di Ying, Zheng Zhenyu, Chen Bosheng, Zhang Daoxing, Yang Dezhao, Chen Zifeng, Wu Zhimei, Li Mangui, Pi Yishu, and more than seventy others.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Joint Office of the Executive Yuan Ministries and Commissions Held Its First Meeting</h3>
<p>Officials Staying in Nanjing Decided to Work Together</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Twenty-first Dispatch] The joint office of the ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan stationed in Nanjing held its first meeting at the Presidential Palace at 10:00 AM on the 21st. More than ten people attended, including the heads of various ministries and commissions staying in Nanjing, such as Huang Bodu, Acting Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Chen Liang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food. The meeting was presided over by Ni Jiongsheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. The meeting decided that the officials staying in Nanjing from various ministries and commissions should move into the Presidential Palace to work together immediately. The meeting also discussed the treatment of personnel staying in Nanjing from various ministries and commissions, and decided to telegraph the Executive Yuan in Guangzhou immediately, requesting that the treatment of personnel staying in Nanjing from various ministries and commissions be paid according to the Guangzhou standard, the reason being that the families of the personnel staying in Nanjing from various ministries and commissions are all in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Twenty-first Dispatch] After the Executive Yuan moved to Guangzhou to work, emergency withdrawals of funds required by various agencies in Nanjing have recently been submitted to Ni, Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, for approval and disbursement. Mr. Ni felt that the number of items handled in recent days was large and the responsibility was heavy. At the meeting of the joint office of the ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan stationed in Nanjing on the 21st, he specially proposed two points, which were passed by the meeting: (1) When each unit requests an emergency withdrawal, it must first be submitted to the original competent authority for approval. For example, in the case of emergency withdrawals for schools, the Ministry of Education should first be requested for approval. (2) The Ministry of Finance should send important personnel to Nanjing to jointly review and approve emergency withdrawals with Deputy Secretary-General Ni. In the future, Cheng Zimin, Deputy Director of the National Treasury, should not only be stationed in Shanghai, but should also travel between Nanjing and Shanghai frequently.</p>

<h3>National Army in Northern Shaanxi Withdraws from Tongchuan and Yaoxian According to Plan; Communist Army Decides to Actively Reorganize Troops</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Xi'an Twenty-first Dispatch] The Xi'an Pacification Headquarters issued a battle report on the 21st: (1) The main force of the Communist Army in Northern Shaanxi, the 1463rd Column led by Peng Dehuai, attacked our troops defending Tongchuan and Yaoxian on the 19th. After our troops fought back, they withdrew from Tongchuan and Yaoxian at dawn yesterday (the 20th) according to plan and retreated to advantageous areas, but Yaoxian is still defended by our national troops. (2) The Communist troops who infiltrated near Wangshan have retreated northward to Juhui, ten miles north of Yaoxian, after being attacked by our troops. (3) The move of our troops to withdraw from Tongchuan and Yaoxian has profound implications for ensuring the safety of Guanzhong, and the main purpose is to demonstrate the responsibility for the war with facts, in order to promote the progress of overall peace.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Twenty-first Dispatch] It is reported that the Communist Army in Northern Shaanxi, in its southward advance, claimed that one route would follow the old route of capturing Baoji for the first time to capture Baoji, and the other route would trend towards the area between Tongguan and Xi'an, so as to create an encirclement posture against Xi'an. General Hu Zongnan is giving them a head-on blow. The previous rumor that Hu's troops had entered Sichuan was purely a rumor.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Twenty-first Dispatch] Recently, the Communist Army in Central Plains held an important military meeting, deciding to appoint Chen Yi as the commander of the East Front Corps and Chen Geng as the commander of the West Front Corps, actively reorganizing the troops, and intensively deploying as many as 3,000 ships in the secluded areas of Gaoyou, Hongze, and Chaohu Lakes.

<p>[Our Newspaper Pukou Twenty-first Dispatch] It is reported that the Communist Army in the Bengbu and Hefei area has been quite busy recently.

<h3>Qingdao Situation Clarified; Qin Dechun to Take Office Within the Week; Possibility of Unified Leadership</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Qingdao Twenty-first Dispatch] Sources familiar with the situation revealed that Qin Dechun's delay in taking office in Qingdao was due to (1) the central government's indecision on Qingdao's status in the past, and (2) Mr. Qin's efforts to increase the number of troops of Feng Zhi'an and Liu Ruming stationed in Qingdao to consolidate its defenses. The situation in Qingdao has now been clarified, and there is no problem with the principle of holding firm. The northward deployment of Feng and Liu can be realized. It is reported that Mr. Qin will come to Qingdao within the week. The municipal government's guest house has been renovated to welcome Mr. Qin.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Qingdao Twenty-first Dispatch] A well-informed source told reporters that there is currently no sufficient reason to prove that Qingdao needs to take emergency measures: (1) The Communist Army outside the city is weak and has no active intentions. There is peace and quiet for hundreds of miles in Jiaodong. (2) The Supreme Command of the National Army has not completely finalized this move in Qingdao. At least a week ago, it made new considerations. (3) The withdrawal work that must be carried out should have been started early in terms of the situation. As for whether the US military will "withdraw," the facts have already explained it, and there is no need to discuss it further. The US military's "transfer" work can be said to have ended in late last month, but it still maintains the presence of warships in the harbor and announces the stationing of a very small number of personnel to indicate that it has not "withdrawn." Unless Qingdao falls into the hands of the Communist Army, this meaning will continue to exist. The US military will never imagine using the Qingdao military port in the hands of the Communist Army, so it will never casually use the word "withdrawal" until the last moment to observe the changes in the situation. The person also said that Ramsay's repeated emphasis on using the word "transfer" in his reports to Chinese and foreign reporters seems to be consistent. As for the National Army, the withdrawal of military dependents has been largely completed. Some personnel of the pacification zone have gone south. The military explained that the purpose of this move is to dispel the concerns of the officers and soldiers on the front line. However, the southward movement of industrial and military materials and the contraction or informal dissolution of military, political, and financial institutions will gradually make Qingdao a purely military defense stronghold. Some local people believe that after Chadchun comes to Qingdao, the possibility of a unified leadership will be greatly increased. The person also said: After receiving a certain order, the military authorities once formally and publicly expressed the future trend of Qingdao's situation to the persons in charge of various relevant institutions, and then reserved the previous meaning, which made the order in Qingdao tense and chaotic for several days. The reporter learned that this move made the relevant institutions, especially financial institutions such as the Central Bank, feel confused, because they cannot coordinate their business and invigorate the economic lifeline unless they receive clear instructions. However, the situation has greatly eased in recent days, the spot exchange rate has been rapidly shortened, and the market situation has gradually become normal. The withdrawal plan of the central government agencies in Qingdao was started several months ago, but it was not carried out under the instructions of the highest military and political organs here. The well-informed source finally told reporters: Qingdao is currently quite stable, and all kinds of speculations and concerns are still too early and not helpful to the actual situation.</p>
<h3>Sino-Soviet Negotiations; US Expresses Concern</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Twentieth Dispatch] Official sources reported on the 20th that the United States is extremely concerned about the current Sino-Soviet negotiations, which may give the Soviet Union long-term mining and trade rights in northwestern China. The reporter stated that if these talks are successful, Xinjiang Province will be incorporated into the Soviet sphere of influence and violate the terms of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty approved by the Chinese government in November of last year. Little is known here about the Sino-Soviet talks that are taking place in the capital of Xinjiang Province. However, reports from China claim that these talks will lead to the signing of a 40- to 50-year agreement giving the Soviet Union the right to mine gold, silver, copper, iron, coal, and other minerals.

<h3>Chongqing Garrison Headquarters Director Zhang Qun Takes Office, Expressing Earnest Words, Repeatedly Emphasizing that the Grand Strategy of Peace or War Will Obey Central Orders, and Measures Have Been Drafted to Stabilize the Southwest Financial Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing 21st Dispatch] Zhang Qun, accompanied by Qian Dajun, went to the Garrison Headquarters in the same car at 9:30 AM on the 22nd. At 10:00 AM, the inauguration ceremony was held in the auditorium. Liu Wenhui, Wang Lingji, Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, He Guoguang, Qian Dajun, Jing Yisu, and Sichuan-Chongqing provincial and municipal council speakers Xiang Chuan'yi and Fan Zhongqu, along with hundreds of others, stood in front of the stage to listen to the speech. Zhang first stated: He had served as the director of the Rong-Yu Executive Headquarters three times and once concurrently served as the chairman of Sichuan. Returning to Sichuan this time for more than ten days, he deeply felt the great responsibility. He had been listening to reports from all sides these days, reviewing the situation, and considering solutions. He believed that the current situation in the southwest requires more local assistance, concentration of manpower, and thorough cooperation, seeking progress through reform, and saving oneself, the hometown, and the country. He repeatedly emphasized that the grand strategy of peace or war would obey the central government, and that more responsibility should be taken for stabilizing and protecting the southwest. He urged people not to be intimidated by the current environment, to strengthen their faith, to unite sincerely, and to grasp the demands of the people, stating that the southwest definitely has a solution. Zhang affirmed "seeking innovation and change," which is the common desire of people, but concrete manifestations are few, the reason being rooted in ingrained habits of following old ways, perfunctoriness, and conservatism, preserving the status quo, and the vested interests of the privileged class overemphasizing their own interests and freedom, while their desire to dominate and occupy forces others into a dead end. Zhang frankly told the attendees to reflect on why intellectuals are increasingly criticizing the government or not cooperating with it. The current situation requires changes not only in military failures, but also in politics, economics, society, and psychology. Regarding how to stabilize southwest finance, ensure self-sufficiency in materials, and the suggestions of some individuals to plan the southwest as a separate economic zone, Zhang stated that he has invited relevant leaders to brainstorm ideas and formulate measures, and after the central government's economic policy is announced, they will coordinate with the plan to complement each other. What can be told now is: (1) Land reform should be properly planned and decisively handled; (2) A property tax will be implemented; (3) Redundant institutions will be cut, and expenditures will be tightened; (4) Exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies will be abolished, and special donations will be collected from wealthy households. Regarding the collection of grain for land tax, it was decided to adopt the opinions of the participants to stop collecting in kind at the end of this year and restore the collection of currency, so as to reduce the harassment of the people. As for the collection of military and public grain, separate measures can be formulated. Zhang's speech lasted for three quarters of an hour. He appealed that unity is strength. All emotional rifts, ideological discrimination, conflicts of rights, misunderstandings leading from secret struggles to open contention, are enough to cause both sides to suffer. Sharing peace and happiness is easy to conflict, but sharing adversity is easy to cooperate. In the future, prejudices should be eliminated, and the will of the people should be followed to work together. He also frankly admitted his own mistakes, otherwise, without the Communist Party seeking liquidation, he himself would collapse. After the speech, he stepped down, shook hands with the leaders and chatted, and invited them to a tea party.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing 21st Dispatch] Sichuan Council Speaker Xiang Chuan'yi, today at Zhang Qun's inauguration ceremony, represented the guests in his speech. He hoped that peace would be realized soon, and that politics would be reformed, people's hearts would be won back, and the southwest's defense capabilities would be strengthened, and especially hoped that the southwest authorities would be consistent in their steps. Yu Council Speaker Fan Zhongqu also gave a speech, requesting Zhang Qun to immediately invite the leaders of the five provinces and cities of Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Yu to hold a meeting to self-examine the reality.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing 21st Dispatch] Important personnel adjustments in the Garrison Headquarters: Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Zongkuan concurrently serves as the Director of the Third Division, Zhou Junliang is appointed Director of the Office, and Yuan Jinji is the acting Director of the Fourth Division.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing 21st Dispatch] Han Renmin, Deputy Commander of the Sichuan Military Control Zone, after requesting instructions on military administration at 2:00 PM on the 21st, flew from Yu to Rong. It is reported that the Sichuan province's conscription quota may be reduced, and both conscription and recruitment will be used.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Starting with the Mindszenty Affair</h3>
<p>US Minister to Hungary Chapin was recalled to the country to report on his work. On the 18th of this month, he passed through Paris and made a statement to reporters, saying: "Hungary, especially the government, is still continuing to arrest Roman Catholics. Since arriving in Paris from Hungary, I feel very happy to breathe the free air of France. As for the situation in Hungary, it is unimaginable, beyond description. Anyone in Hungary, unless blind, can easily see that the Hungarian people are under the complete control of the Communist Party and do not know what their lives are like." We have never been very clear about the actual situation in the countries behind the Eastern European Iron Curtain. Even regarding the trial of Hungarian Cardinal Mindszenty, before understanding the truth, we were somewhat reserved and unwilling to make hasty judgments. But today, after synthesizing information from all sides, the truth has become clear. At the same time, a Bulgarian government newspaper also announced that fifteen pastors will be tried for treason and espionage. We really can't help but comment. Because if the practice of depriving religious freedom continues, many bishops, priests, and pastors of Catholicism and Christianity, as well as many monks of Buddhism, in China will also face the same fate in the CCP-controlled areas.</p>
<p>Cardinal Mindszenty was arrested by the Hungarian government in Esztergom on December 26 last year. According to a statement issued by the Hungarian government, he was arrested on two charges: (1) engaging in espionage activities, attempting to conspire to betray the government; (2) illegally trading foreign currency. Six other people were also arrested at the same time. At that time, because the case was complicated, the outside world did not know the truth, but the Hungarian government's attempt to eradicate the influence of Catholicism among the people was obvious. Therefore, upon hearing the news, both Paris and the Vatican were shocked and hoped that the Hungarian government would conduct a trial as soon as possible to clarify the case.</p>
<p>However, the Hungarian government delayed again and again until early February this year before starting the trial. During the first court session, the prosecutor suddenly abandoned the fundamentals and did not question the above two charges. Instead, he stated that Mindszenty had secretly written to US Minister to Hungary Chapin in prison, asking him to lend a hand to save him from drowning and escape from Hungary by plane. When Mindszenty answered, his voice was low and his response was vague. The court immediately announced that he had "directly admitted to it." The intention of the Hungarian prosecutor's move was very clear: In short, it was to expand the incident, turning it from a domestic event in Hungary into an international event. On February 5, the court session continued. British and American people requested to attend the hearing but were refused by the Hungarian authorities. The British and American governments protested but were ignored. Therefore, all freedom-loving people with a sense of justice are worried about Cardinal Mindszenty. Sure enough, within a day or two, the Hungarian prosecutor announced that the case was established, filed a public prosecution, and demanded the death penalty. The reasons they cited were: 1. Mindszenty led an organization that conspired to overthrow the Hungarian government, thereby helping the Habsburg royal family to restore power; and expected the third world war to break out soon, so he contacted American intelligence personnel, and the United States has long wanted to manipulate Hungary economically and politically. Therefore, Mindszenty's actions were actually based on an imperialist organization to help the United States dominate the world."</p>
<p>This public prosecution was submitted to the Hungarian People's Court, which, after a brief interrogation, sentenced Mindszenty to life imprisonment on February 8 and confiscated all his property. This barbaric and illegal behavior of the Hungarian government almost aroused public outrage in various countries around the world. Not only Paris and the Vatican expressed dissatisfaction, but London and Washington were also very angry. British members of Parliament immediately visited Foreign Secretary Bevin after hearing the news, requesting the British government to formally protest to Hungary; public opinion in the United States was even more filled with passionate emotions. Even the Hungarian people did not approve of it. Because the country is under the strict control of the Communist Party, it is impossible to express their opposition. However, Hungarians abroad have made tangible protests against this inhumane and anti-religious action. The resignation of the Hungarian Consul in New York, Balassa, is a perfect example.</p>
<p>Even without standing on the "religious freedom" standpoint, seeing the Hungarian government persecuting Catholics in this way, one cannot help but sympathize with Bishop Mindszenty. In recent years, the Soviet Communist government has also indicated that people can obtain religious freedom, but after seeing the Mindszenty incident, one can suddenly realize that "religious freedom" within the Iron Curtain is entirely a self-deception by the Communist Party. US Secretary of State Acheson made a statement to the press on February 9, denouncing Hungary's persecution of the church. He said, "This move is actually the Hungarian government, manipulated by the Soviet Union, persecuting the church regardless of conscience in order to remove its anti-communist moral force." He also said, "The Hungarian people have no real freedom to speak of." Secretary of State Acheson's remarks were the most pertinent, and President Truman also expressed his agreement. Therefore, although the Mindszenty incident itself has passed, the consequences of this incident, which are sufficient to affect the world situation, are developing and may deepen the rift between the East and West worlds. We hope that all freedom-loving people in the world will be vigilant about this event that violates "religious freedom."</p>
<p>Secondly, many people now have illusions about the Communist Party, thinking that there is real freedom behind the Iron Curtain. Therefore, in the context of the recent smooth military development of the CCP, they also have some hope for the "democracy" and "freedom" promoted by the CCP. Even American journalists or church people have recently often reported that the CCP authorities in various places do not seem to be persecuting the church very much. We, of course, also hope, with a "desire to be good to others," that the CCP will not be completely closed within the Soviet Iron Curtain and that their practices will be different from those of the Communist parties in Eastern European countries. However, who can guarantee that the CCP will not copy the old articles of the Communist parties of Hungary and Bulgaria and other countries after stabilizing the situation in the controlled areas?</p>

<h3>Pang Shusen Resigns as Chairman of Jiangsu Provincial Assembly, Sends Telegram to Ding Zhipan Attaching Three Requests for the People from Chen Weimin: Stop Conscription, Rectify Military Discipline, and Prohibit Illegal Arrests</h3>
<p>[This City News] The position of Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Assembly has been approved by the Executive Yuan to be succeeded by Pang Shusen. It is learned that Pang has declined due to insufficient energy. He has telegraphed the Executive Yuan and Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Ding to request resignation. The original telegram to Chairman Ding also includes three requests for the people from Chen Weimin. The original telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Ding Xunjian: According to the report, the Executive Yuan meeting has approved the appointment of Pang Shusen as the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Assembly. Upon hearing the news, I feel very apprehensive. Shusen has served the local community for forty years. In the past twenty years, although I have been in a retired state, I will still devote myself to local public welfare. However, I have long been tired of my political career. Now, I suddenly hear about the appointment, and I think that I do not have this talent in public and I do not have enough energy in private. The seat of the chairman is difficult for Miao to bear. In addition to the telegram to the Executive Yuan, I will also telegraph the situation again, respectfully requesting you to quickly re-appoint a capable person to preside over the seat. The utmost prayer is. I have also seen the recent situation in the region, and there are things that must be requested for the people. I respectfully attach them: (1) The conscription system is full of malpractices, and the people are complaining. Driving these young adults who are thinking of escaping before the battle to face the crisis of a hundred cracks will only spoil things. This conscription should be stopped. (2) Currently, in various counties in Jiangnan, there are garrisoned troops and military families arbitrarily occupying people's houses, as well as schools and factories, forcibly conscripting boat troops, harassing the local area, and demanding huge supplies. Although this is done by a few undisciplined people, the people's resentment can be heard everywhere. This military discipline needs to be rectified urgently. (3) Recently, during the peace talks, it was heard that arrests of young people and students were still occurring in various places, which violates the central government's intentions and the provisions of the law, and is not enough to show the sincerity of the peace talks. These illegal arrests should be strictly prohibited. The above three points are the most serious suffering of the people, and should be improved immediately. Shusen will still contribute his humble opinions as a member of the people at any time for selection. I pray for your clear understanding. Pang Shusen Kouchou (Ge)"</p>

<h3>Regarding the North Atlantic Security Treaty, Britain Does Not Insist on Military Guarantees; Seven-Nation Negotiations Expected to Proceed Smoothly; Norway Decides to Join the Treaty; Sweden Greatly Disappointed</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] Well-informed sources say that British Foreign Secretary Bevin has sent a new instruction to the British Ambassador to the United States, Franks, regarding the Atlantic Treaty. Bevin instructed Franks to assist in accelerating the process of the treaty in the following ways: (1) Do not insist in the treaty that the United States must provide military assistance guarantees in the event of war; (2) Current negotiations should be limited to seven countries, with other countries joining later. Sources close to the government pointed out that if the Western powers relax their position slightly, the draft can be completed next month and signed in late March or early April. It is also said that British experts are now considering whether it is possible to sign two other treaties: (1) a Mediterranean Treaty and (2) a Pacific Treaty. Authorities believe that these two treaties will be discussed after the Atlantic Treaty is signed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Diplomatic officials say that an important decision in the negotiations on the North Atlantic Treaty is expected to be reached this week. At the same time, this historic treaty is very likely to be signed within a month. High-level consultations between countries and within Congress are scheduled to be held this week. These consultations may be the most important since negotiations began last July. They said that Secretary of State Acheson will meet with the ambassadors of Canada, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The information discussed by the seven countries will then be submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for review, and other similar meetings will follow. Officials said that unless unexpected obstacles are encountered, this week's meetings may make the remaining negotiation work a routine technical matter of wording. The hope of signing the treaty has been expanded due to the support of Republican policy leader Senator Taft. Taft said he supports a North Atlantic Treaty similar to the Western Hemisphere Defense Treaty signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1947. The Western Hemisphere Treaty stipulates that an attack on any American country will be considered an attack on all American countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Well-informed diplomatic sources say that Norway may participate in the North Atlantic Treaty negotiations within ten days. It is said that a formal invitation to Norway will be issued after the Norwegian Parliament formally approves joining the Western alliance. It is reported that the powerful Norwegian Labor Party overwhelmingly supported the treaty last night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Stockholm, 20th, United Press] Swedish Prime Minister Erlander said today that given Norway's decision to join the Atlantic Treaty, Scandinavian defense negotiations are now impossible. Sweden is well aware that the people of every country should decide their own foreign policy based on their own historical foundations. The division of the three Scandinavian countries is truly a matter of unhappiness for the three countries. [United Press, Copenhagen, 20th] Denmark still adopts a cautious attitude towards the Atlantic Treaty. Denmark is at a loss among its Scandinavian allies. Sweden is undermining this treaty, while Norway is preparing to join.</p>

<p>[Our Report] New York, 21st Broadcast: Cairo News: A senior official of the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the claim reported from Haifa that the Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Agreement has been signed on Rhodes is not true.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rhodes, 21st] The delegation representing the country flew back to Cairo today with the draft of the Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Agreement to seek instructions from its government. According to delegation leader Edin, Egypt will decide its position on the Beersheba issue no later than the 22nd.</p>
<p>Although the Israeli delegation has accepted the entire agreement, the Egyptian side has not yet agreed on the section regarding the disposition of Beersheba. According to unofficial sources, the draft agreement generally recognizes the current boundaries. Israel shall not use Beersheba as a base, but may station troops there. In addition, it stipulates the exchange of prisoners of war and the permission for Egypt to pass through Israeli territory along designated routes to withdraw troops stationed in Jerusalem and the Falujah pocket area. Beersheba is located in the southern Holy Land and is the birthplace of the Arab nation. It has been occupied by Jewish forces since last October. However, according to the UN General Assembly partition plan in 1947, it is not within Israeli territory. The area is strategically important, with highways converging, east to Transjordan, south to Egypt and Saudi Arabia, west to Gaza, and north to Jerusalem, all concentrated here.</p>

The first defendant was out on bail and did not appear. After Zhou Naihao testified, the court adjourned and rescheduled the trial. The facts alleged in the case are as follows: On March 15th of last year, the first defendant, Sha Sailan, had a verbal dispute with Zhu Xu, a woman in the Reformatory, due to work-related reasons. Sha used a butcher knife to stab Zhu Xu, causing serious injuries. Afterward, Sha colluded with Zhou Naihao and, under the guise of sending her to work for the Relief Association, sent Zhu Xu to Beijing through Zhou in an attempt to destroy evidence. Later, a neighbor, Yin Jin, reported the above situation and the fact that Huang Wang in the Reformatory had been beaten and miscarried to death. The District Prosecutor's Office initially ruled not to prosecute, but the plaintiff applied for reconsideration. The High Prosecutor's Office ordered the District Prosecutor's Office to conduct an investigation, which resulted in the prosecution of both defendants on charges of assault. It should be noted that the second defendant, Zhou Naihao, is also being investigated in another case in the District Court for alleged embezzlement and misappropriation.</p>

<h3>The Green Team's Female Warriors Widely Known - Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Invite Them to Compete</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is not uncommon for men's basketball teams from this city to compete abroad, but it is rare for women's basketball teams to travel abroad, except for the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team, which crossed the sea to the east some time ago. The Green Team's women's basketball team has been a force in this city for many years, and their skills and accomplishments are superior to those of the Liangjiang team, and their reputation has spread overseas. The Philippines, the base of basketball in the East, has also been impressed by the name of the Green Team and has the intention of inviting the Green Team to compete in the South. The Manila Youth Association's new building was completed, and during the winter overseas Chinese leader Lin Zhuguang from Minbu wrote to Qian Xucang, chairman of the Municipal Basketball Committee, requesting that a team be formed to compete there. Qian immediately recommended the Green Team, but most of the players in the team were unable to go due to work or school commitments. It is heard that the Filipino representative in Hong Kong entrusted Cai Jindian, a player in this city, to contact the Green Team. Cai proposed two solutions: (1) Cai himself would be the coach, or (2) the Green Team would select nine players, and Cai would select the rest. This was not agreed to by the Green Team. Recently, several overseas Chinese in Shanghai have said that the Hong Kong women's basketball team is a big draw, and that it would be more profitable to go abroad, and are actively seeking to contact players. In addition to basketball skills, the players' appearance is also a condition. There are major questions about their intentions in organizing the team to go abroad and about the prevailing atmosphere in women's sports. When applying for permission to go abroad in the future, it is hoped that the Municipal Sports Association and the Basketball Committee will give serious consideration. Even if the Green Team eventually goes abroad, it is necessary to have careful planning and training beforehand regarding the deployment of personnel, the state of women's basketball in the Philippines, and the use of men's and women's rules. It is impossible to act rashly. Since it is going abroad as a representative team from this city, it must be done in this way.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Asks Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Promulgate Measures to Supplement Capital Conversion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to Minister Deng of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday at the request of the Sauce and Pickle Commercial Association, asking him to promulgate measures to supplement the registration of changes in profit-making enterprises' capital converted to Gold Yuan as soon as possible. The telegram stated: After the promulgation of the revised measures for the issuance of Gold Yuan on November 13 of last year, the original measures for registration of changes were no longer appropriate. The Ministry had formulated eleven supplementary measures for the conversion of operating capital to Gold Yuan and, to gather opinions, Minister Deng of the Commerce Department of the Ministry sent a draft of the supplementary measures. The Association submitted six suggestions on December 25 of last year requesting their adoption. The original deadline for supplementary registration of changes, originally set for May 19, 1949, was proposed to be extended by three months to August 19, 1949. Article 2 of the supplementary measures, which stipulated that the amount should be uniformly increased by five times, was requested to be changed to an increase based on the price index announced by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics for the previous month. The Association's letter stated that its original suggestions were included in all of the above, but two months have passed, and these supplementary measures have not yet been submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Furthermore, the deadline for registration of changes as stated in Article 3 of the original measures for registration of changes issued on October 20 of last year, which was February 19, 1949, has long since passed. If the provisions in that article are followed, and enterprises that have not registered changes are to be dissolved, liquidated, and have their licenses revoked, this would cause great turmoil and go against public opinion. Therefore, the Association has submitted this telegram to the Ministry for consideration, requesting that the supplementary measures for registration of changes, in accordance with the Association's suggestions, be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation as soon as possible for compliance and implementation, as it would be beneficial to all.</p>

<h3>Stock Exchange Reopens on First Day: Over 2.1 Billion Shares Traded; Mayar Silk, New Kwang, etc. Hit Limit Up</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Stock Exchange officially reopened yesterday, and many people from the financial community came to congratulate. Before 9:30 AM, 204 brokers entered the exchange one after another. The bell rang at 9:30 AM, and trading began. Due to slight changes in the bidding unit, trading was somewhat chaotic. The trading situation was not as hot as expected. As a result, only 23 types of stocks opened for trading, and eight types, including Datong, New Kwang, Jingfu, Jinglun, New Asia, Wing On, New China, and Taiwan Sugar, reached the limit up.

<h3>Central Mint Opens Silver Coin Minting</h3>
<p>Weight of Seven Mace One Fen Eight Per Coin</p>
<p>The long-rumored currency system reform has been confirmed by a financial authority. The new coin to be released will be a silver coin, with the same design as the old silver coin issued in 1934, with Sun Yat-sen's portrait on the front and a sailboat on the back. The fineness of the silver coin is comparable to that of the Yuan Datou, weighing seven mace one fen eight. According to sources, the Central Mint may start minting silver coins from this week, but it will take a considerable period before they circulate in the market. The reform of the currency system must be formally approved by the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has now moved far away to Guangzhou, and there are in fact many difficulties in deciding on this important matter, so it will still take some time.</p>
<p>The rumor that the Central Mint is minting half-yuan silver coins is, according to reliable sources, a misinterpretation of one-yuan silver coins. The reporter inquired with relevant authorities at the Central Bank at 5:00 PM yesterday, and it was said that the minting of silver coins is for the purpose of new economic reform. The new economic plan still needs to be agreed upon by all parties before it can be implemented.</p>
