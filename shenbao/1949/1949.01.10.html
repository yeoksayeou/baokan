<h3 id="c24">中國新經濟政策芻議 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 壽勉成</p>
<p>無論國際或國內的戰爭，其直接原因，雖錯綜複雜，不一其端，而其根木原因，則無不在於經濟。我國共產黨之倡亂，其表面動機，雖在奪取政權，然其所號召，仍在經濟上之改革；而其所以能支持至今，亦在經濟。故我國政府亟應從經濟澈底改革，方足以期戡亂之成功，與和平之勝利。否則戰爭自戰爭，民生自民生，戰爭旣無勝利把握，卽勝利亦難持久，因特草成中國新經濟政策綱要，以建議於當局，並求政於明達。</p>
<p>第一，中國新經濟政策，慼以合理化為量高原則：中國應根據國情，參酌各國經濟政策的優點，自定其合理的經濟政策。資本主義以個人主義私利競爭為出發點，流弊極大，原不足為訓，但其成功處，亦未始不可參考。共產主義以集體生義公有公營為出發點，抹殺個性，束縛自由，亦不甚合於情理，但亦未始無其優點，足資採納。孫中山先生的民生主義，原欲採各制之長，而去其短，惜辦法不甚詳盡，且因事實演變，亦不得不酌加修正或補充，以期盡合時間及空間之要求。</p>
<p>吾人欲求經濟政策之合理，在空間方面，必使其能合於全國各地之不同需要。中國各地情形縣殊，其文化水凖，相差幾隔數十世紀。故經濟制之伸縮性與適應性，極為重要。在時閒方面，必使其能逐步演進及逐步改進，旣不能一蹴而及於高度現代化之境界，亦不能採行一成不變之制度。在社會方面，必使其能與全體人民或最大多數人民之要求相符合，絕不可以少數人之利益為前提。在步驟方面，必須分別先後緩急，把握重心，擇其要者急者，先予認眞實施。</p>
<p>余以為中國的新經濟政策，應特別加强合作組織與合作事業的發展。蓋合作事業為民主化社會化之經濟組織，有私產經濟及共產經濟之利益而無其流弊，且當有伸縮性，使能適應不同時閒及不同空閒之需要與能力，實為最合理的經濟制度。合作組織，用之於農村，可以加强農民組織，解決農地分配，發展農村經濟；用之於城市，又可以提高勞工地位，發展工業經濟，加强消費組合，便利物價管制。</p>
<p>第二，中國新經濟政策應較共產主縱更公平合理，較資本主義更經濟有效，始能期其成功：中國共產黨以土地革命及淸算豪劣為號召，富有者固多聞而恐懼逃避，而赤貧者雖不明共產主義為何物，每以其有利於已，不免妄從。實則中國眞正了解共產制度者固不多，而具有實行共產制度之能力者必更少。資本家方面之情彩亦然。彼等徒知效法英美，以為只要政府對民營事萊，不加管制，任其自由發展，卽可形成英美資本主義的制度。其實中國今日的資本家，眞正具有建設資本主義制度的能力者，恐亦不多。但是假使我們不能積極努力於新經濟制度之建立，使其較共產主義更公平合理，較資本主義更經濟有效，而徒知消極反對，決難收效，而且可以促致戡亂軍事的失敗。</p>
<p>第三，中國新經濟政策必以計劃統制為主要方式，應卽擬具長期計劃統制實施：政府以往曾擬過五年計劃，但因各種條件均不具備，以致毫無結果。計劃建設的第一條件，是創造精神。政府必須具有破壞舊制度建設新制度以達成某種理想之創造精神，然後計劃建設始能成功。其次，計劃建設尙須有科學精神的條件，必須很客觀，很超然，很精密，很具體，很能切合事實，很能把握要點，使執行者眞能照計劃去實施而有效。計劃建設還需要實踐的精神，換言之，就是有了計劃，必須統制執行，計劃如與事實不符，必須隨時修正，修正以後，仍須統制執行，非達成建設目的不止。</p>
<p>第四，各部門建設，及各級政府對於實施計劃統制，必須彼此銜接密切配合：我在上面主張實施重點計劃，與關　統制，可以舉幾個實例。糧食與棉花的增產，是可以實行重點計劃的。鐵路與水路的建設，也是可以實行重點計劃的。要實行這些重點計劃，必須控制其主要關鍵，例如種籽，肥料，水利，農具，是糧棉增產的關鍵；鋼鐵，燃料，木材是鐵路水路建設的關鍵。但這些重點與關鍵，必須要有各部門及各級政府的配合，始能根據計劃，完成統制。例如土地制度，物價制度，銀行制度，敎育制度，處處均與此各項建設發生密切關係，如彼此脫節，卽談不到計劃的建設，卽能建設起來，亦將無工作效率可言。</p>
<p>第五，實行新經濟政策，必須採行新經濟敎育，轉變一般社會之觀念與風氣：現在一般社會大都抱個人主義，拜金觀念，自私自利，爾爭我奪，無所不用其極。在此種風氣之中，決無實行合理化新經濟之可能。其次則敎育與事業之脫節，亦為一極大缺陷。學農的不屑業農，學工的不屑做工，而只肯做機關的職員，實已失盡經濟敎育之功能。所以中國敎育，需要澈底改造。在精神方面，要切實培養各級學生互助合作的生活觀念與生活習慣，重公利而輕私利；在技能方面，要敎習學生眞正做農做工的實務技能，一切敎材必須適合中國實際需要，西文材料僅能提供參考，不能選作敎木。學生赴國外留學，除少數學生外，均應以實地考察為主，並須提出考察報告。在責任方面，凡實科畢業學生，必須從事實務工作，不得任意轉業或集中機關担任公務。</p>
<p>第六，實行新經濟政策，必須發動社會力量配合政府共同策進：新經濟政策的實行，關係人民生活的每一部門，及全國各地的每一角落，並必有與封建勢力利害衛突的地方，所以單靠政府的法令，必難澈底執行，或推行盡利。在一黨專政的局面之下，還可以利用黨的組織；在多黨政治的局面之下，也許選要這反對黨的破壞。因此動員社會力量，共同推行，是必不可少的一個條件。此種發動及團結社會力量之工作，可以新經濟政策協進會之方式行之。</p>
<p>第七，實施新經濟政策，應推行工作競賽，技術指導，並獎進科學發明，以增進經濟效率：我國技術落後，資本缺乏，欲增進工作效率，必須推行工作竸賽，技術指導，並獎　發明。這些工作，黨政機關業經試辦，但成績均差，問題似在對工作無確實認識，同時亦因無具體計劃，可資配合。例如在重慶的時候，我記得印刷工人，曾舉行排字快慢的競賽，夫印刷的快慢，可謂無關宏旨，而舉行載賽，豈能謂為當務之急？技術指導比較有認識，但範圍大小，獲益甚淺。獎勵發明，過去僅有事後之區區獎勵，而無事前之積極鼓勵與培養。且發明不能僅賴個人自由活動，而必有機關團體之集體行動，此更朱能做到，亦其缺點。</p>
<p>第八，實行新經濟政策，必須嚴格獎懲，推行新政有功者信賞，妨害新政有罪者必罰：我國實行新政之法令固多，缺芝革命性之規定，但卽就現有之法令而言，亦多視同具文，無甚功效。獎懲辦法，本身之不明確，固其原因之一，而獎懲之不認眞執行，尤為一重要原因。我國社會對認眞工作者甚少鼓勵，且每因排斥異已，而故加摧殘，則更反其道而行之矣。（具體辦法從略）</p>
<p>以上所述八項原則，其目的無非在使人人皆有生活，而且人人生活皆能逐步改善。中國有甚大土地與甚多勞力，中國的物資亦不乏為國外所需要者，可賴以換回國外之機械與技術者。其足以妨得吾人實行新經濟以改善人人之生活者，惟戰爭之破壞，人民之怠惰自私，國家之無革命決策與革命能力三者而已。假使中國欲求能生存於現在的世界，欲使人人皆能享受人類慼有之福利，則必向合理化社會化之路，以尋求我國新經濟制度之方針，實屬無可否認。</p>

<p>巴勒斯坦局勢最近發展　華府表示重大關切　美蘇調查英機被撃落真相　　〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕美官方今日對巴勒斯坦方面英機被以色列軍擊落事甚為關切，但希望各方普遍接受聯合國停戰令後，英國與以色列閒不致發生更嚴重之糾紛。官方最初反應認此事不免激怒英政府，且引起英國人民之新反猶潮，惟不致為此事開戰。　　〔合衆社台拉維夫九日電〕以色列官方人士九日稱，以政府將向聯合國嚴重抗議英國派遺武裝戰鬥機飛越以色列上空之「不可否認之敵對行為」。彼等稱，英軍隊及配備之開往巴勒斯坦南部貼鄰之亞喀一事「非常嚴重」，並質詢英國目前是否自認為交戰國。英以空戰詳情於八日發表時，以色列總理古利翁及外長薛托克均不在台拉維夫，然兩人在向聯合國及美國務院提出正式最後文告前，正研究聯合國觀察員被俘兩英機師等各方面之報告。以色列官員堅稱，英機五架均在以領土及埃以邊界上空被猶太陸空部隊擊落，彼等再三否認英方所謂空戰在埃領空發生之說。美代表麥唐納及蘇大使葉蒂夫赴台城附近以政府所在地哈基雅，詢問英機被擊落之詳情，兩人九日亦可望謁見薛托克，麥氏且與美軍事參贊商談。被俘英機師麥克厄豪已由以色列高級情報人員押至台拉維夫候訊。　　〔法國新聞社開羅九日電〕迄今為止，關於尼基夫方面之戰局如何，詳情無由獲悉。據聞英空軍業已出動轟炸以色列之集中及其縱隊。具有國際背景聖地爭案變質　捷克指英應負阿猶戰爭現任　　〔法國新聞社巴黎八日電〕據此間消息靈通方面今日聲稱，最近數日中已勒斯坦爭案，已完全改變性質，其要素有四：（二）埃及允於以色列開休戰談話，（二）英外部詆責以色列，謂以色列軍現受俄人協助與阿拉伯軍作戰，（三）外約但援引一九四八年英國與外約但之條約，申請英國予以援助，（四）賴達已建設伊拉克新政府，由賽特為領袖，其人竭力贊助伊拉克叙利亞巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人部分合併為一，而處於外約但王阿勃杜拉治下，此一合併必須俟與巴勒斯坦猶太人獲得和平解決後始能實現。　　同一方面又指出該計劃並定將以尼基夫割予外約但，按外約但今親英頗甚，而亦為英國所重視者，因英國如一旦被迫完全退出埃及運河區域，則可以外約但為其軍事根據地也。故昨日在尼基夫迫近處發生之天空不幸事件，或將為英國作極有力干涉行動之先聲，巴勒斯坦整個問題今似將成為尼基夫問題，但就今日之情勢而論，已超越僅為猶阿爭端之範圍矣。　　〔法國新聞社倫敦八日電〕英官方今日强調英軍一批之開往亞喀巴，主旨為戒備起見。係完全根據英國與外約但條約行事。外部發言人雖拒絕發表派往亞喀巴之英軍之實力，但悉英國王家空軍如駐於亞門與瑪佛拉克，實與條約相符，發言人又謂以色列軍現仍駐於埃及境內，詎拉發南約三哩之遙，以色列軍之勝利，多賴捷克助以飛機軍械十彈之力，而運濟阿拉伯人軍械則在禁例。　　〔合衆社普拉格九日電〕捷克九日指斥稱：巴勒斯坦戰爭之所以不停，純係「英國在撥動阿拉伯之槍機」。捷京「人民新聞」報以「作賊」為題發表社論稱，「若無英國之帝國主義政策，巴勒斯坦亦不致再有流血，而阿猶兩族亦可和平相處。」又稱，「英國亦應負荷蘭進攻印尼及破壞聯合國憲章之一半責任。英國不以之自責，其外相反以之責人，反之，聯合國原則及決議之在巴勒斯坦之被違犯，英國應為元兇。按英國上週指斥捷克私運軍火資助以色列。「人民新聞」乃予以反攻。尼基夫區戰事復起　聖地發生猛烈爆炸聲　　〔法國新聞社開羅八日電〕尼基夫區今日在不到一小時之沉靜後，戰事又起。埃及方面謂此事乃因以色列軍隊向埃及陣地開火所致。阿拉伯聯盟秘書長阿柴姆今日宣稱，埃及並未要求外國作軍事援助，亦未考慮要求英國實施聯盟條約之義務，蓋埃方認為此條約已經失效也，阿氏對一部份阿拉伯政治家因巴勒斯坦局勢之轉變而取　豫態度一點，表示扼腕，且謂一般相信猶人方面將切實覆行新停戰命令者，實屬過份樂觀。　　〔法國新聞社耶路撤冷九日電〕聖城東區八日晚發生猛烈之爆炸聲，據可靠軍事消息，指此係發生意外事件，但當局則對於此事拒絕說明。我國受戰事影響非洲轉向日購茶　　〔中央社東京九日電〕自戰事結東後經常受價廉物美華茶威骨之日本綠茶出口，最近意外好轉，非洲茶葉進口商以中國境內戰事情勞，未能於中國購茶，均已來日採聯。本週已有本年首批日木出口綠茶一百五十萬務啟運赴非。印尼決爲獨立奮鬥　暹正式拒絕出席新德里會議　　〔合眾社喀拉基八日電〕據印尼駐聯合國代表團長蘇米特洛八日談稱，印尼共和國將繼續在獨立「戰爭中，採用游擊戰術及焦土政策」，蘇氏對報界稱，解決印尼問題之唯一關鍵，在於「共和國政府之決心·共和國領土之恢復，荷軍之撤退。及自由的普選」。　　渠稱：「雖然吾人感謝美國凖備隨時協助任何荷印閒合作的適當方式，但我不能同意美國的下列觀點，卽由於荷蘭的祖保，共和國領袖的疑懼可能緩和。「渠繼稱：美國及其他强國「現在實應負担亞洲所發生之事件的重大責任」。　　〔聯合社新德里九日電〕外交部發言人今日宣稱：亞洲與近東各國由印總理尼赫魯發起定於本月二十日舉行會議，討論印尼問題。會期共計三天，屆時各國將就對付荷蘭在印尼行動之步驟互相交換意見。　　〔合衆社倫敦九日電〕此間九日訊：印尼總統蘇卡諾及其他印尼領袖由荷蘭當局釋放後，可望出席新德里會議。　　〔合衆社曼谷八日電〕據可靠方面息，暹羅致印度公使備忘錄件，拒絕印度之邀請出席新德里會議，謂暹羅政府在等待「現在處理印尼問題之安理會再行努力之結果」。英暹聯合剿共雙方獲協議　　〔法國新聞社曼谷九日電〕英暹兩國參加宋脚軍事會議之代表團，關於兩國陸空軍及警家在馬來亞及暹羅邊境之兩面，協力剿滅潛伏於森林中之共黨遊繫隊問題，現已獲致協議。宋脚暹代表團發表最後之公報稱，宋脚之英暹會議進展極為滿意。英方此次出席代表包括布契爾將軍·警察方面之重要領袖葛雷上校。按寫雷係嫻長對遊擊隊作戰之人物，渠在巴勒斯坦獲得對進擊隊作戰之不少經驗。批准艾契命前　參院須充分調查　共和黨主要議員提出要求　　〔合衆社華感頓八日電〕參　員范登堡及共和黨其他主要議員，八日要求參院批准艾契遜出任國務鄉以前，應先加以充分關查。共和黨戰員等欲明白艾氏對對於蘇聯，東西閒衝突，及被指斥為有不安全危險之國務部官員採取何種態度。艾氏或亦需披露其律師事務所與波蘭共黨政府之關係，以及渠與及其本人與被控為共黨分子希斯兄弟閒之私人關係。　　艾氏之任命為國務卿，引起外交界之揣測，認為可能杜魯門總統已決定在外交政策方面自已担任更重要角色。杜魯門與艾契遜之知友堅稱，此一任命並非對蘇採取較為軟化之政策之謂。按艾氏係最先主張「對蘇採取堅毅而忍耐之態度」之一。范登堡現為共和黨外交政策之主要發言人，渠稱，艾氏為杜魯門之「私人人選」。范氏復謂，此次任命事前未與國會兩黨外交政策領袖商討。薛敏頓竭力主張　美建大空軍　陸軍徵兵足額　　〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕空軍部長薛敏頓今日重申美國將建立空軍七十隊，不顧巨額支出。七十隊空軍為四年計劃特色之一，目的在至一九五二年時，空軍力量能慼付任何事變。　　〔合衆社華感頓八日電〕美陸軍之志願入伍及再度入伍人數，侮月平均為三萬五千人，由於此種高比率，陸軍部官員宣佈在一月及二月間將停止徵召。陸長羅雅爾稱：「在志願入伍及再入伍足够保持陸軍之實力時將停止徵兵」。夏威夷火山噴岩　繼以地震暴雨　　〔聯合社夏威夷島希洛城八日電〕夏威夷島瑪納洛火山爆發後，今日繼以强烈地震，廿四小時來大雨傾盆，積水盈尺，火山下若干區域已泛濫。電訊交通斷絕，損失不明。我留美學生向美國呼籲　要求經濟援助完成學業　　〔中央社紐約八日專電〕此間外國學生顧問全國協會特別委員會，已分別向社魯門總統·國會議員。及國務院所屬之敎育交換顧問會發出呼籲，要求以二百五十萬美元作為在美外國學生五千名（此數包括中國學生二千九百名）之緊急經濟援助。特別委會於函中指出，由於外國政府缺少美元外匯，及美國留學費用之高漲，在美外國學生二萬五千人中，至少有五千名將無法完成其於本年六月卽可修畢之學業，而將被迫回國。特委會並建議國務院，應修改有關外國學生之移民規則，俾彼等能在目前緊急情勢下，繼續留美攻讀。按外國學生顧問全國協會特委會，係由中美協進社外國學生聯誼委會等組織。特委會上述行動，乃美國敎育界為協助留美外國學生，尤其經濟告中斷之我國學生二千五百名所作之最大努力。紐西蘭總理發表談話　強調太平洋聯盟生要　　〔合衆社渥太華九日鴛〕紐西蘭總理弗萊塞九日透露，當聯邦刊總理於去秋會談時，可能已討論太平洋防禦聯盟。弗萊塞對報界稱，太平洋聯盟係「非常重要之問題」，如果此項協議達成，渠個人認為加拿大美國及拉丁美洲國家均應參加。弗萊塞拒絕明確說明太平洋公約將予訂立，並拒絕進一步解釋渠之觀點。渠稱，此事並非急迫迫需要者，但「如危機機確已存在，則若干協議顯然必須達成」。弗氏提出去年加拿大外畏裴爾森曾稱，英聯邦國家當已注意此項協定，渠稱，「但對此並無官方之談話」。但繼稱，「一切太平洋沿岸之國家均應參加」。盟總對日政策被誤解麥克阿瑟特致電剖白　指美雜誌論文全非事實　　〔聯合社紐約八日電〕本期「觀望」雜誌載前紐約時報外交記者亞朋一文，指麥師縱容日木共產主義，已使美國人發生誤解。麥帥今日親自致電該雜誌主筆柯爾斯更正，謂該文所言各節全非事實，純係虛偽宣傳，與莫斯科慣用技倆如出一轍。且亞朋於戰後並未到過日木，對於日本情形隔膜。亞朋文中則稱麥帥對遠東危局，具有一種虛偽的安全感。共黨已潛人日木工會，蘇聯已利用麥帥總部之高壓與不民主手段為宣傳工具。共黨勢力極為强大，美國一旦對蘇作戰，陰謀破壞與內部不安，將　美國本已動搖之地位更加削弱。麥帥總部戰後並不使日本自給自足，日人僅維持區區戶口配給活命。佔領軍多數高級人員認為日木可能轉為反美親蘇，麥帥不察自以為得計，共黨絕無抬頭機會，事實上日本方面新聞檢查嚴厲，美國人無從得知眞相，此種情形應向麥帥個人負責。</p>

<p>昨星期照常辦存兌　平衡費又提高千元　首批申請者一週後公告領金銀辦法　　〔木報訊〕昨為星期例個，中央銀行當局於八日晚九時許，始決定照常辦理存兌金銀工作，臨時通知各行局庫一體照辦。惟黃金平衡費又絞八日提高一千元，存兌黃金者，除兌價一千元，存款一千元外，須再付平衡費七千元，合共九千元。存兌銀元者，每元兌價十元，存款十元，須再付平衡費七十元，合共九十元。國行以決定匆促，卽新聞界亦朱及普遍通知，故外界知者較少，再加週日銀錢業休假，現鈔供應亦少，各行局庫門前排隊索取申請書者，無前兩日之擁擠。結果國行發出申請書四百張，中國二百張，交通一百張，中信局五十張，合作金庫數字未悉，郵匯局則以同仁散居各處，無法及時普暹通知，暫告停發一天。據悉：今後各行局庫每週日仍將照常發給申請書，可能仍以每週三為存兌工作之休假日，木週三可作最後決定。又依照規定，第一批（卽五日）申請存兌金銀已繳現款者，將於一週後公告領取金銀辦法，故預計央行當於十二三日左右，公告領金辦法。輪船業維持困難呈政院請貸二億　定明日推代表晋京請願　　上海市輸船業公會，以輪船營運，極度困難，陰曆年關迫近，資金不易局轉，特於昨日具呈行政院及財交兩部，請由國家銀行貸款二億金圓，以資維持。茲據該會負責人告記者稱：輪船業困難原因：（一）軍運頻繁，各輪船多數應差，而差輪租金，極度低落，僅佔航行成本三十分之一，其所付之差費，又積欠至一二月不發，及發款之時，幣値又低落數倍。且裝貨迂緩，貽誤船期，損失亦鉅，故輪船應差一次，幾等於毫無收入，全部賠累，（二）疏散時間，各輪船疏運公敎人員及運送公物，回程多係空放，損失極鉅。（三）煤價·汕價·外匯匯率及各種物價，不斷的調整與波動，輪船運價，雖經調整，但時時脫節落後，虧蝕不貲，在限價期內，損失更重。（四）燃煤·煤汕·配量不足，必須以黑市補充，官價與黑市之差額，亦為輪船公司之重大負担。（五）貨運淸淡，開支浩大，無可緊縮，而運費收入，例須於運輸後始行收款，並往往延遲，而船公司之任何開支，均須付現，其閒因幣値之降低，利息之負祖，俱影響於資金之周轉，而年終發給雙薪，益形拮据。由於上述因素，各輪輪船公司對於購買燃料·物料及發給薪工，顧此失彼，捉襟見肘。現計各輪船公司於陰曆年關之內，關於購買燃料·食米及發給薪工等必要之支出，需款四億二千萬金圓，而購買五金物料，保險及修船費用，尙未計算在內，此項必要之支出，擬由各公司自籌二億二千萬元，其餘二億元，請政府准由國家銀行貸放，並定於明日推派魏文翰·李雲良·鍾山道·沈琪等代表晋京請願。船聯通電呼籲和平　　全國輪船業聯合會，昨通電呼籲和平，原電云：南京蔣總統，延安毛澤東先生，全國各團體，各報館均鑒：吾民之厭苦兵爭久矣，同一國土，同一民族，同一文字，縱有政治信仰之不同，儘可由會議協商解決，本不必以兵戎相周旋，使人民遭受斷項折肢燬產破家之慘禍。今總統有元旦和平文告，毛先生亦向以和平為重，願與各黨派合作，則化干戈為玉帛，正在此時。伏祈雙方卽日下令停戰，指定地點，重開和議，此旋乾轉坤之偉舉，在歷史為禎祥，在民意為光明，留完整之山河，度和平之威月，奠建設之基礎，養殘破之生機，祗須諸公一轉念之間，便可實現，諸公重視民主，民意趨向和平，諾公垂念民生，民生需要安定，務懇慨然接受，矜平躁釋以赴之。昔太平天國先烈有詩云：「我志未酬人亦苦，東南到處有啼痕」，請為諸公誦之。同是國人，勝不為武，讓不為辱，百世之是非，將於今日之能讓與否以上之。臨電悚惶，伏祈鑒察。全國輪船業聯合會理事長杜鎕暨上海，鎭江，南京，蕪湖，安慶，大通，九江，漢口，宜昌，沙市，萬縣，重慶，天津，靑島，鎭海，鄞縣，永嘉，福州，厦門，基隆，汕頭，廣州，上海內河，常熱，吳縣，無錫，蚌埠，南昌，長沙，湘潭，梧州，邕寗，瑞安，吳興，江陰，柳江，林森，武進各地輪船業公會同叩子佳」。央航滬平綫今起幽復航　　〔本報訊〕中國航空公司滬平綫復航後，中央航空公司滬平綫亦定於今日起復航。班機每逢一·三·五，經南京·靑島，當日來回。復航飛機用C-47型沙發椅雙引擎機，較中國之C-46型運輸機為佳。留滬全體立委宴會市長議長等均被邀　　〔本報訊〕昨午十二時，留滬立委江一平，王新衡，陸京士，駱淸華，朱文德，楊管北，李雲良，王劍鍔，劉丕基等，假招商局餐廳邀宴吳市長，潘議長，徐副議長，方主委，祝次長平及留滬全體立委共百餘人，盛會延至下午三時，賓主始盡歡而散。工業技術展覽昨日圓滿閉幕　　〔木報訊〕中國技術協會主辦之工業技術展覽，於昨晚六時圓滿閉幕。展覽會自去年底開幕，一再應各界要求展延，共歷十二天，雖値天氣嚴寒，觀者如堵，每日在寒風中排隊參觀，感况始終不衰。此次展覽會中，列陳各種珍貴模型及實物，及各項圖表統計資料，蒐羅宏富，尤以「新技術展覽」部份，對塑料（Plrslcs），雷達及原子能方面，有一深入淺出之介紹，為我國學術界成功之創舉。他如紡織機械，，電訊器械，及塑料壓模機與雷達儀，均有實地表演。據悉：此次展覽本尙有水利工程及水力發電之模型兩具，惜以交通運輸困難，不得已才予放棄。又展覽會後，技術協會將舉行各項參觀及講座，會期中觀衆登記者近萬人。一俟地點時閒決定後，卽由該會通知。該會平日經常有講座及參觀舉辦，可經常注意報章消息美福來輪船公司闢滬日韓新航綫　　〔本報訊〕美商福來船公司，對於遠東輪船事業，積極擴展，除南洋綫，上海至香港，小呂宋，暹羅，印度，緬甸等埠，派中國怡美利，印度怡天利，暹羅怡美利，及馬來西怡次利等各輸經常參加行駛外，對日本，朝鮮，近又闢新航棧，聞有新巨輸「貝德裏斯星」號，日內卽將到埠，該輸毛噸將近藝　，速率甚强，以後專駛上海，日本，朝鮮及西印度，兼航波斯聲。何應欽將軍來滬入醫院割治蘭疾　　何應欽將軍來滬割治痔疾，於昨日入國防醫學院，定今日施行手術，據聞約週後可出院。新任市府統計長褚一飛明日視事　　市政府統計長張宗孟辭職後，審計部特調派江蘇自政府統計長褚一飛繼任，業經吳市長同意，定於明（十一）日到職視事。教部田次長來滬夏堅白等今訪晤　　〔木報訊〕本市八國立大專院校校長，前為經費困難無法維持，於本月五日聯名電部辭職，迄今敎部未有覆電，各校長頗為焦慮。現悉敎部次長田培林於昨晨自京來滬，一般推測田次長此行卽與各校經費問題有關，但昨日尙未與各校長接談。同濟校長夏堅白等已定今日往訪，敎部之態度究為如何或卽可分曉。針織業年終獎金手搖烘熨組解決　　針織業手搖機組，烘熨組，絲襪續機組等工人年獎爭議，經勞資雙雙代表王思本，王維彰等十餘人，於前晚起漏夜協商，迄昨日午後，已獲協議，計手搖機技師發給年獎工資二個月，該組工人工作在三個月以下者，一次發給八元八角，三個月至六個月者，發給十四元四角，六個月以上者，發給二十七元。烘熨組工人工作在三個月以下者，發給六元八角，三個月至六個月者發給十一元二角，六個月以上者，發給二十一元，以上各級年獎，一律於太月十三日以前發給，照十八倍三指數計算，如十三日以後發給者，須照常期指數計算，又絲襪橫機組工人年獎，勞資雙方代表定於今日午後繼續協商。葷素菜價大漲　茹素已不易吃肉更大難　　〔木報訊〕連日物價激漲聲中太市各小菜塲之菜　腥價格，亦急遽追踪上昇。昨為星期例假，魚肉鷄鴨等董腥價格，愈形飛黃騰達。一般賴十八倍三生活指數過活之薪工階級，祗能望肉興嘆，叫苦通天。昨日各項董腥價格，以鷄鴨漲勢最凶，肥鷄每斤自四十六元至五十元，前日則為卅二元至卅八元。肥鴨每隻（約五六斤重）自二百五十元至三百元不等。猪肉腿精每斤自四十二元至四十四元，排骨四十六元，肋條亦須卅八元。牛肉每斤卅二元至卅四元。鷄蛋較大者各攤販每枚索價六元半至七元。魚類中帶魚已落令，冷氣小黃魚每兩索價一元半，銅盆魚每兩二元，靑魚等高貴魚類每兩價均在二元半以上。他如蔬菜，亦已較三五日前漲起五成至一倍。冬筍每斤已漲至十六元，雪裏紅每斤五元，白菜菠菜等每斤均須六元，塔窠菜漲至二元半，豆腐每小方四元，黃豆芽發芽荳等每斤六七元不等，卽凍　之小棵靑菜，每斤居然亦索價二元。菜蔬價格長此猛漲，一般薪工階級勢將重陷三月不知肉味之苦境，卽茹素亦匪易寒流侵襲下殮死求生忙　上週收露屍四六具流動車街頭接難胞　　太市連日為寒流侵襲，各慈善團體收舉之屍體，為數甚夥，大都為市區以內各平民醫院，殘疾所，養老院，及居民等報請收殮者。至街路凍斃之屍體，尙無發現。記者昨走訪普善山莊及同仁輔元堂，叩詢收屍經過及詳情，據普善山莊負責方面發表：計上週內收獲屍體共卅一具，皆為病死之成人，收獲之地點，共分平民醫院，殘疾所，養老院，麥根路車站，閘北太陽廟被服廠，鐵路醫院，騐屍所，時疫醫院，美德新邨，北火車站月台，外灘四號碼頭等各地。同仁輔元堂負責方面發表，上週內收獲成人屍體共十五具，皆為各平民醫院報請收殮者。記者並往訪市救濟委負會負責方面，據稱：該會流動收容車，於上年杪起，卽開始於每晚出動，收容街頭丐乞及流浪難民，迄目前止，已收獲四百餘人，皆安置於漕河涇庇寒所，供給食宿。該會並自日前起，將流動車改為日間出動，積極收容，隨車人員，並以和善態度，勸導人庇寒所，因此收容之難胞，並無逃亡等情形發現。此外自動請求入庇寒所者，為數亦甚夥，該會並盼各界居民，如於住所附近發現流浪難民，請隨時通知該會，派員收容，而免凍餒。爲便利初臨異地者通訊　郵局提倡函件候領辦法　　〔本報訊〕本市郵局鑒於連年戰亂，人民流動性增大，初臨異地，住址靡定，親友通訊，發生困難，因此積極提倡「存局候領」辦法，凡初至某地，尙無固定住址者，可通知親友將信件寄至指定郵局，留待本人領取。此項信件，封而除詳細寫明某地某某郵局留交某某人（收件人姓名）外，並於左上角註明「存局候領」字樣，郵局卽可照辦，收件人可隨時向該指定郵局詢問，出示證件領取郵件，僅需納少數手續費。此種函件存候領有效期限，國內為一個月，國外寄到者為二個月，逾期不領作無法投遞郵件辦理，寄件人如在封面上註明「留至幾日無人領取，卽請寄回」者，亦可照辦。同時亦可由所存之郵局轉寄他局候領，惟收件人姓名務須書寫完整，不得使用暗號等情。彭學沛骨灰葬萬國公墓　設奠舉行公祭備極哀榮　　前中央宣傳部部長上海中央日報董事長彭學沛氏飛港罹難後，各界深表哀痛，彭氏骨灰週前運滬，昨在膠州路英國殯儀館設奠，舉行公祭及家祭，下午三時上羅虹橋萬國公墓，茲將經過略誌於后：上午九時許，萬國殯儀館前素車白馬，憑弔者絡繹不絕，備極哀榮，有翁文灝·王世杰·雷震·黃少谷（中宣部處長費慶楨代），吳國楨·顏惠慶·賀耀組·潘公坡·杜月笙·吳開先·方治·沈怡·徐寄廎·徐學禹·東雲章·劉靖基。趙祖康。俞飛鵬。林崇墉。及中央日報社李秋生·程玉西·沈公謙·屠仰絲等，自朝至午共三百餘人。各團體公祭省有市黨部各區黨部。中央日報社。亞東協會·中國紡織機器公司等單位。下午家祭畢，由孝子彭乃瑤親捧紫銅質「骨灰　」偕家屬親友分乘汽車數十輛至虹橋路萬國公墓，三時十分將骨灰鏝安葬石穴內，親友等鞠躬致哀，三時四十分安葬禮成而散。（附圖為彭公子奉貯骨灰古銅　至墓地。中國社攝）一級旅館房金加倍　　〔華東社訊〕木市旅館業前呈請社會局調整房租，曾遭市政會議否決，茲悉，該業之第一級旅社，昨日已分別通知住客，新房金增加百分之一百收費。　　又悉，市府參事定為本會審核旅業調整房租，定今日上午九時召集會議討論。呂增楊夫婦八十雙慶　　今日為新聞報經理呂光之尊翁增揚及令堂（見圖）八十雙慶，又適逢五十年金婚紀念，蔣總統·許崇智·居正·孫科·吳國楨·錢新之·杜月笙等均頒陽頌詞壽屏。當以時値非常，除在杭州西湖老宅舉行家庭感恩禮拜外，概不舖張，至親好友均贈壽碗，藉資記紀念云。　又太市世界紅卍字會會畏應成傑，明日五秩壽辰，王正廷，王曉籟等特為發起在長樂路該會大禮堂舉行祝嘏，決將所有社儀現金悉充善舉。劉維熾發表談話工商部兩大工作　　工商部長劉維熾九日在此對記者發表談話，揭示增加生產及改善進出口貿易，為工商部當前兩大中心工作。劉氏謂：由於煤與棉花國內供應量之減少，致若干工廠陷於减工停工狀態，所予國家經濟之影響甚大，工商部現正縝密考慮，疏暢工業原料暨動力之來源，俾工業界最低限度能維持原來之產量，再作進一步增產之打算。此項問題，不久當可獲得決定。至於工貸一事，關係工業之榮枯，過去貸款之對象及數額，俱由國行決定

<h3 id="e1">North China Enters Decisive Battle Phase; Battles Fluctuate Around Tianjin; Communist Bandits Attempt Probe Attacks on the Outskirts of Beiping, Repelled by National Army <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The decisive battle of the main forces in the North China theater is gradually unfolding. According to a military observer: the strategic intentions of the communists are roughly clear. Because the National Army in Beiping is strong and its fortifications are solid, they are currently focusing all their efforts on attacking Tianjin, and then resolving Tanggu and Dagu. Afterwards, they will concentrate on attacking Beiping. It is reported that the communist forces of Lin Biao's units have already gathered eight columns near the suburbs of Tianjin.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 9th, 3:20 PM] After a period of lull on the outskirts of Tianjin on the evening of the 8th, the fighting reignited fiercely after midnight, with intense battles on the eastern, southeastern, and western fronts. Military intelligence: in the direction of Xiyingmen, from 3:00 AM to 6:00 AM on the 9th, the communist First Column attacked along the south bank of the Grand Canal, and the Second Column advanced along the Ziya River. The National Army tenaciously resisted along the river fortifications, killing or wounding more than 3,000 bandits, who were unable to withstand and retreated. The bandits at Jinzhong River and Fanjiabao in eastern Tianjin launched a night attack yesterday, charging fiercely twice, but were also repelled. The bandits in southern Tianjin launched wave-like offensives towards Liqizhuang last night, but were ultimately overwhelmed by the superior firepower of the National Army. At dawn on the 9th, Fanjiabao in eastern Tianjin was attacked fiercely again by bandits, and fierce fighting broke out. After 10:00 AM, the situation calmed down. The bandits attacking Nanbeixinzhuang west of Tianjin are also in a standoff with the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin Dispatch, 8th] The Political Warfare Department of the Tianjin Garrison Command announced: Since Lin Biao's Seventh Column, led by Deng Shuming's main force, the Nineteenth and Twenty-first Divisions, launched a fierce attack on Dongjuzi east of Tianjin, after two days of fierce fighting, by the morning of the 8th, our army had achieved its annihilation mission. Since there was no need to defend the position any longer, it was ordered to withdraw actively. Lin Biao's Seventh Column, after two days of fire and blood, suffered heavy losses and no longer had the ability to fight. Dongjuzi has now become a no-man's land. As of the evening of the 8th, the bandits were reorganizing and awaiting reinforcements in Limingzhuang and Chenglinzhuang, under close surveillance by our army. The bandits attacking Fanjiabao from Zhao Gu Li Zhuang were the Twenty-second Division of the Eighth Column, which launched a fierce attack on us with the entire division, blindly firing over thirty mountain guns and field guns, but were all repelled by us. As of the evening of the 8th, fierce fighting was still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] The North China Pacification Headquarters announced on the 9th: In the main battle on the outskirts of Tianjin, the National Army achieved another victory under the active attack coordinated by land and air forces. Lin Biao's bandit troops, on the 8th, poured in most of their forces and relied on various artillery fire to attack the positions northeast of Tianjin at Zhao Guo and Li Zhuang on the south bank of the Jinzhong River, Dingzigu to the northwest, Fanjiabao to the east, and Xiyingmen to the west. The battle lasted all day and was unprecedentedly fierce. The officers and soldiers of the National Army were in high spirits and used a fierce fire net of infantry, artillery, and air power to continuously repel more than thirty waves of human-sea assaults by the bandits. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, with corpses strewn everywhere. Around 10:00 PM, Lin Biao's offensive against the outskirts of Tianjin suffered another major defeat.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 9th, 6:00 PM] The battles on the outskirts of Tianjin all subsided after 10:00 AM on the morning of the 9th. There was no sound of artillery in the city, and both sides were busy reorganizing and deploying. On the night of the 8th and the morning of the 9th, National Army planes continuously flew low altitude reconnaissance and bombing missions over the Tianjin suburbs, which played a great deterrent role. The sky was filled with the rumble of engines all day.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 9th, 6:00 PM] With the lull on the outskirts of Tianjin on the afternoon of the 9th, the city gradually returned to prosperity, with more pedestrians on the streets and many shops reopening. However, prices soared unexpectedly, with a bag of flour costing 800 yuan and a bundle of cabbage costing more than 20 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 9th, 7:30 PM] After half a day of lull in Tianjin, the rumbling of artillery was heard again at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 9th] The artillery fire on the outskirts of Tianjin has affected the urban area for days, and residents of the suburbs are moving to the city center.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 9th] The Tianjin airport has not seen any planes take off or land for several days. The authorities have started building a second airport in the city.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] According to reports from Tianjin to the Pacification Headquarters, the National Army killed or wounded more than 8,000 bandits on the outskirts of Tianjin yesterday, and captured six strongholds outside Xiyingmen. Amidst the National Army's victory, the citizens enthusiastically showed their support for the troops.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th, 7:22 PM] From Deshengmen to Guang'anmen in the western suburbs of Beiping, there was widespread contact last night and this morning. From 10:00 PM yesterday to 5:00 AM this morning, the rumbling of artillery was incessant, and the duration and breadth of the battle lines were unprecedented in the battles on the outskirts of Beiping. However, the military stated that this was still a small-scale probing attack by the bandits. At 10:00 PM last night, more than 3,000 bandits launched separate attacks on the area west of Huangsi near Deshengmen and the Model Prison outside Xizhimen, the Xibianmen Railway Station, the Racecourse outside Guang'anmen, Ganshuiqiao, the Paper Mill, and other places. By 11:00 PM, the fighting was fierce. By 1:00 AM this morning, the bandits finally collapsed and retreated. The fighting in the southwest of Beiping was fierce for a time after 3:00 AM this morning, but after being suppressed by the National Army's artillery fire, they retreated after 5:00 AM. After 9:00 AM, the battle in the southwest suburbs reignited, and a group of bandits harassed the Shenzhouguan, Sanluju, and Jiudaowan areas. The sound of artillery could be heard intermittently this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] The North China Pacification Headquarters announced on the 9th: There has been no change in Tanggu and Dagu for days. The National Army's search and suppression units are constantly making contact with bandits on the outskirts. Xinhe and Beitang are still firmly defended by the National Army.</p>

In addition, Chu Xichun, the Inspector General of the Kuomintang, Government, and Military Affairs of the North China Pacification Headquarters, dispatched inspection teams today to patrol the city market. Anyone found raising prices will be executed on the spot. Prices in Beiping have fallen as a result of these strict measures.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The Beiping Municipal Government received a telegram from the Ministry of Food today stating that the central government has formulated a plan to airlift food, starting from Qingdao. Thirty planes will be available each day, with a daily transport capacity of 10,000 bags of flour.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The food problem in Beiping is serious. Zhao Qingzheng, Director of the Hebei Provincial Grain Administration, Yu Xiu, Director of the Finance Department of the Pacification Headquarters, and Jian Moshan, representative of the Hebei Temporary Senate, will fly to Nanjing on the 10th to appeal for the transport of grain to North China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] The "Regulations for Recruiting Civilian Labor to Defend Beiping" were decided by the Municipal Government yesterday and implemented, and the previous "Measures for Conscripting Civilian Labor" were abolished. According to these regulations, male citizens aged 18 to 45 are all organized into teams to assist with military needs and construction in turn. Public employees and students throughout the city will form their own teams to work collectively, limited to one-third at a time, and will not be included in the civilian labor teams. Those who do not have male members in the family but are well-off should contribute labor fees to equalize the burden of labor and financial resources for the people.

Finally, they mobilized their First, Second, Third, Fourth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Bohai Columns, which had been rapidly replenished after the Nianzhuang battle, as well as three independent brigades, and launched a fierce attack before dawn on the 6th on the 100 square kilometers of wilderness held by Du Yuming's troops. This attack began with a fierce bombardment. General Du Yuming immediately commanded the entire army to return fire with heavy artillery and sent a telegram requesting air force assistance. In order to "eat up" this large National Army force, Chen Yi's communist troops had to risk being bombed and strafed by planes gathering around the periphery of the encirclement in order to achieve their goal. In total, in the four days since, more than 50,000 soldiers have been killed or wounded, with the National Army suffering casualties from concentrated artillery fire from the communist troops, and the communist troops suffering casualties from the National Army's artillery fire and air strikes. On the night of the 8th, in order to assist Du's troops, the Air Force dispatched multiple C-47 aircraft to drop bombs on the south, west, and north sides of Zhouji, where the communist attacks were most intense. At dawn on the 9th, multiple Shenying aircraft, under the command of Deputy Commander Wang Shuming, were dispatched in batches to the battlefield to carry out destructive bombing. In particular, B-24 aircraft dropped bombs on Zengzhuang, Weizhuang, Wangzhuang, Zhouguanzhuang, Qinshuangcun, Xiaoshizhuang, Zhangjiazhuang, and Jihutong, the bandit strongholds surrounding Du's troops, inflicting heavy damage on the bandits. The Wangzhuang communist artillery position was destroyed, and the bandits in each stronghold suffered approximately 500 or more casualties each. At approximately 8:00 AM on the 9th, Deputy Commander Wang Shuming personally flew a B-24 aircraft to the battlefield to command and supervise the battle. The pilots of each fighter plane, under his command, became even more courageous and fierce, searching for and bombing and strafing the communist troops hiding in the trenches. By the afternoon, Du's troops had completely occupied Liuji. It is reported that this fierce battle is developing towards its climax. Liu communist forces' three columns in Guzhen, northern Anhui, and Chen communist forces' Seventh Column are rushing to the Chenguanzhuang Du's troops' area to support the communist forces. Although some National Army positions, such as Lulou, have been lost, Du's troops are still maintaining their calm fighting spirit of more than ten years, persisting in bloody struggle, hoping to achieve the goal of consuming more of the communist troops' strength. The scale of this battle is larger than Nianzhuang and Shuangduiji, and it is certain that it will yield greater results than Nianzhuang and Shuangduiji.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 9th] The communist bandits Sun Chuanjia and Su Yu's troops, who were rampaging in the areas of Outang and Daishan southeast of Dingyuan, have been encircled and suppressed by various units for days, leaving only five or six thousand people, who are now fleeing southwest of Outang. The bandits in the Xuyi area east of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, after being suppressed by the National Army, suddenly turned back towards Gucheng and the Silishiqiao area from Maba, Gangcun, and Liantang and other places.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 9th] After the snow cleared, northern Anhui stabilized, and the "Dan Bang" traders on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are active, and the traffic is very crowded.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Since the beginning of the fierce battle in the Xiaoyong area, General Du Yuming has always lived and died with his troops. The rumor that he was flown out by the Air Force is not accurate. Deputy Commander Wang Shuming was still in wireless telephone contact with Du when he flew to the battlefield on the 9th.

The first aircraft was damaged by anti-aircraft fire after landing, and the second aircraft may also have been damaged by communist artillery fire.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] After Foreign Minister Wu Tiecheng personally delivered the memorandum to the ambassadors of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on the 8th, inviting friendly nations to mediate the Kuomintang-Communist issue, the efforts to strive for peace have entered a new stage. Everyone is still awaiting the official reply from the Chinese Communist Party regarding the peace issue, and how the four governments will consider this invitation is attracting much attention. It is reported that although Soviet Ambassador General Luo Shen has been slightly ill recently, he is still very concerned about the situation in our country. He did send embassy officials to contact our government on the 8th and accepted the diplomatic documents submitted by our side. A well-informed source revealed that the government's important action may have been decided after obtaining understanding from a certain friendly nation. If so, this should be the fruitful result of Zhang Zhizhong's continuous efforts in recent days.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 9th] Wu Tiecheng, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, visited President Sun Ke and President Chiang this morning to report on the results of his discussions with the ambassadors of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France regarding the possibility of the three major powers assisting in the mediation of the civil war.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the matter said: Wu did not directly request mediation during the talks on the 8th but only inquired about the attitudes of the three ambassadors regarding their respective governments' new policies on peace in China and the possibility of their assisting in this effort. The source said: If the replies of the three major powers are sympathetic and beneficial to the government, a direct request for mediation will be made. He said: Wu did not meet with the Soviet ambassador because he wanted to first inquire about the attitudes of countries that are generally considered friendly.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] Unofficial sources said on the 9th that Foreign Minister Wu Tiecheng had requested the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union to consider the situation in China and mediate for peace when he met with the ambassadors of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France yesterday. French Ambassador Meyrier has forwarded this matter to Soviet Ambassador Luo Shen, who is currently recuperating at his official residence.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] Well-informed sources said on the 9th that Shao Lizi predicted that there will be "important developments" in the political situation this spring. Shao is said to have asked Mo Deli, a respected elder from the Northeast, to abandon his plan to go to Taiwan and stay in Shanghai temporarily to work for peace.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 9th] Many legislators are organizing a movement to draft a so-called "People's Peace Plan" to submit to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party as a basis for peace talks. Zhang Qianhua, a spokesperson for this group, said: After the People's Peace Plan is drafted, they will charter a plane to Yan'an to personally deliver the plan to Mao Zedong. Zhang said that his colleagues are planning to convene a congress of various neutral parties outside the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and organize public discussions to promote the People's Peace Program.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Times Agency reports: It is said that Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng recently told his staff that the government's opening the door to peace this time means that the prospects for peace are very promising because the current government, unwilling to see the devastation of lives, is mostly in favor of peace. On the other hand, the Communist Party is unable to continue fighting for the following reasons: (1) Soviet leader Stalin is a firm and steady politician. Although the current Chinese Communist Army has the strength to cross the Yangtze River and defeat the government, he must consider international reactions. The United States is currently preparing to arm Japan and consolidate its defenses in the Pacific, which is unfavorable to the Soviet Union. (2) If the Chinese Communist Party can quickly control China, it is questionable whether it can truly be controlled by the Soviet Union when it becomes fully developed in the future. Due to the above factors, the Soviet Union may advocate reconciliation. (3) The Soviet Union has already controlled North Korea and the entire Northeast and most of North China and Central China in East Asia. This vast territory is sufficient to cope with incidents in East Asia. It is necessary to organize a coalition government and engage in rear-area consolidation and deployment, and then gradually annex. (4) The United States is willing to see the early establishment of a coalition government in order to implement the Marshall Plan to avoid the rapid deterioration of the world situation. (5) The members of the Democratic League need to obtain official positions and are very willing for peace to succeed early in order to advance. This time, they will definitely try their best to win over. Combining all the above factors, the prospects for peace are very promising.</p>

<p>Recent Developments in the Palestinian Situation Washington Expresses Grave Concern United States and Soviet Union Investigate Truth of Downed British Plane</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 8th] U.S. officials today are greatly concerned about the British plane shot down by Israeli forces in Palestine but hope that after all parties generally accept the UN ceasefire order, no more serious disputes will occur between Britain and Israel. The initial official reaction believes that this matter will inevitably anger the British government and cause a new anti-Semitic wave among the British people, but it will not lead to war.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tel Aviv, 9th] Israeli officials said on the 9th that the Israeli government will protest to the United Nations the "undeniable hostile act" of Britain sending armed fighter planes to fly over Israeli airspace. They said that the British troops and equipment heading to Aqaba, which is adjacent to southern Palestine, are "very serious," and questioned whether Britain currently considers itself a belligerent. Details of the British-Israeli air battle were released on the 8th, and Israeli Prime Minister Gurion and Foreign Minister Shetok were not in Tel Aviv, but the two are studying reports from the UN observers who were captured, the two British pilots, and other aspects before submitting formal final documents to the UN and the US State Department. Israeli officials insisted that all five British planes were shot down by Jewish ground and air forces over Israeli territory and the Egyptian-Israeli border, and repeatedly denied the British claim that the air battle took place in Egyptian airspace. U.S. Representative McDonald and Soviet Ambassador Yetiv went to HaKiyah, near Tel Aviv, where the Israeli government is located, to inquire about the details of the British plane being shot down. The two are also expected to meet with Shetok on the 9th, and McDonald will also discuss with the U.S. military attaché. Captured British pilot McErhow has been escorted to Tel Aviv by senior Israeli intelligence personnel for questioning.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 9th] To date, details of the situation in the Negeb are unknown. It is reported that the British Air Force has dispatched bombing raids on Israeli concentrations and columns.</p>
<p>Internationalized Holy Land Dispute Changes Nature Czech Republic Says Britain Should Bear Responsibility for Arab-Jewish War</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris 8th] Well-informed sources here said today that the Palestine dispute has completely changed its nature in recent days, with four key elements: (1) Egypt agreed to open ceasefire talks with Israel, (2) the British Foreign Office criticized Israel, saying that Israeli troops are currently fighting with Arab troops with Russian assistance, (3) Transjordan invoked the 1948 treaty between Britain and Transjordan and requested British assistance, (4) Rida has established a new government in Iraq, led by Said, who is working hard to support the partial merger of Iraqi, Syrian, and Palestinian Arabs under King Abdullah of Transjordan. This merger must be achieved after a peaceful settlement is reached with Palestinian Jews.</p>
<p>The same source also pointed out that the plan is to cede the Negeb to Transjordan, as Transjordan is currently very pro-British and is valued by Britain because if Britain is forced to completely withdraw from the Egyptian Canal Zone, it can use Transjordan as its military base. Therefore, yesterday's unfortunate incident in the skies near the Negeb may be a prelude to a strong intervention by Britain. The entire Palestinian issue now seems to be becoming the Negeb issue, but in today's situation, it has gone beyond the scope of just a Jewish-Arab dispute.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London 8th] British officials emphasized today that the purpose of sending a British force to Aqaba is for precautionary reasons and is entirely based on the treaty between Britain and Transjordan. While a Foreign Office spokesman declined to release the strength of the British troops sent to Aqaba, it is understood that the presence of the British Royal Air Force in Amman and Mafraq is in accordance with the treaty. The spokesman also said that Israeli troops are still stationed in Egyptian territory, about three miles south of Rafa. Israel's victories are largely due to Czech assistance with planes, arms, and ammunition, while the supply of arms to the Arabs is prohibited.</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 9th] The Czech Republic said on the 9th that the Palestinian war continues purely because "Britain is pulling the trigger for the Arabs." The Prague newspaper "People's News" published an editorial titled "Thief Crying 'Stop Thief'" stating, "If it were not for Britain's imperialist policies, there would be no more bloodshed in Palestine, and the Arab and Jewish peoples could live together peacefully." It also said, "Britain should also bear half the responsibility for the Dutch invasion of Indonesia and the violation of the UN Charter. Britain does not blame itself for this, but instead blames others. On the contrary, Britain is the main culprit for the violation of UN principles and resolutions in Palestine."

<p>Indonesia Determined to Fight for Independence Siam Formally Refuses to Attend New Delhi Conference</p>
<p>[United Press, Karachi, 8th] Indonesian representative to the United Nations Sumitro said on the 8th that the Republic of Indonesia will continue to use guerrilla tactics and scorched earth policies in its "war" for independence. Sumitro told reporters that the only key to resolving the Indonesian issue is "the determination of the Republican government, the restoration of Republican territory, the withdrawal of Dutch troops, and free general elections."</p>
<p>He said, "Although we are grateful to the United States for being prepared to assist in any appropriate way for Dutch-Indonesian cooperation at any time, I cannot agree with the United States' view that the fears of the Republican leaders may be alleviated due to the Dutch guarantee." He continued, "The United States and other powers should now bear the major responsibility for the events that have occurred in Asia."</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 9th] A Foreign Ministry spokesman announced today that a conference of Asian and Near Eastern countries initiated by Indian Prime Minister Nehru will be held on the 20th of this month to discuss the Indonesian issue.

<p>Senate Must Fully Investigate Before Approving Acheson's Nomination Leading Republican Senators Make Request</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Senators Vandenberg and other leading Republican senators on the 8th requested that the Senate conduct a full investigation before approving Acheson's nomination as Secretary of State. Republican senators want to understand Acheson's attitude towards the Soviet Union, the conflict between East and West, and State Department officials accused of being unsafe. Acheson may also need to disclose his law firm's relationship with the Polish Communist government, as well as his personal relationship with Hiss, who has been accused of being a communist.</p>
<p>Acheson's appointment as Secretary of State has sparked speculation in diplomatic circles that President Truman may have decided to take on a more important role in foreign policy. Friends of Truman and Acheson insist that this appointment does not mean taking a softer stance towards the Soviet Union. Acheson was one of the first to advocate "taking a firm and patient stance towards the Soviet Union." Vandenberg, now the main spokesman for Republican foreign policy, called Acheson Truman's "personal choice." Vandenberg also said that the appointment was not discussed with leaders of both parties in Congress on foreign policy beforehand.</p>

<p>Chinese Students in the U.S. Appeal to the United States Requesting Economic Assistance to Complete Their Studies</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 8th Special Dispatch] A special committee of the National Association of Foreign Student Advisors has issued an appeal to President Truman, members of Congress, and the State Department's Educational Exchange Advisory Committee, requesting $2.5 million in emergency economic assistance for 5,000 foreign students in the United States (including 2,900 Chinese students). The special committee pointed out in the letter that due to the lack of U.S. dollar foreign exchange by foreign governments and the rising cost of studying in the United States, at least 5,000 of the 25,000 foreign students in the United States will be unable to complete their studies, which can be completed in June of this year, and will be forced to return home. The special committee also suggested that the State Department should amend the immigration rules for foreign students so that they can continue to study in the United States in the current emergency situation. The special committee of the National Association of Foreign Student Advisors is organized by organizations such as the China Institute in America and the Foreign Student Fellowship Committee. The above action by the special committee is the greatest effort made by the American educational community to assist foreign students studying in the United States, especially the 2,500 Chinese students whose finances have been interrupted.</p>
<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Delivers Speech Emphasizing Importance of Pacific Alliance</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 9th] New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser revealed on the 9th that the Pacific Defense Alliance may have been discussed when the Federal Prime Minister met last fall. Fraser told reporters that the Pacific Alliance is a "very important issue," and he personally believes that Canada, the United States, and Latin American countries should participate if this agreement is reached. Fraser declined to explicitly state that the Pacific Pact will be concluded and declined to further explain his views. He said that this is not an urgent need, but "if a crisis does exist, then certain agreements must be reached." Fraser pointed out that Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson had said last year that the Commonwealth countries had paid attention to this agreement. He said, "But there is no official talk about this." But he continued, "All countries along the Pacific coast should participate."</p>
<p>Misunderstanding of Allied Policy Towards Japan MacArthur Sends Telegram to Clarify States U.S. Magazine Article Completely Untrue</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 8th] This issue of "The New Leader" magazine published an article by former New York Times diplomatic reporter Apon, which stated that MacArthur's indulgence of Japanese communism has caused misunderstandings among Americans. MacArthur personally telegraphed the magazine's editor, Kolsky, today to correct the record, stating that all the points in the article are completely untrue and are purely false propaganda, identical to the tactics used by Moscow. Furthermore, Apon has not been to Japan since the war and is unfamiliar with the situation in Japan. Apon's article stated that MacArthur has a false sense of security about the crisis in the Far East. The Communist Party has infiltrated Japanese labor unions, and the Soviet Union has used the coercive and undemocratic methods of MacArthur's headquarters as propaganda tools. The Communist Party's power is extremely strong, and once the United States goes to war with the Soviet Union, conspiracy sabotage and internal unrest will further weaken the already shaky position of the United States. MacArthur's headquarters after the war did not make Japan self-sufficient, and the Japanese people only maintain a meager ration for survival. Most senior members of the occupation forces believe that Japan may turn anti-American and pro-Soviet. MacArthur is unaware of this and mistakenly believes that the Communist Party has no chance of rising. In fact, news censorship is strict in Japan, and Americans have no way of knowing the truth. MacArthur is personally responsible for this situation.</p>

<p>Yesterday Was Sunday, Business as Usual for Deposit and Exchange The Balancing Fee Was Raised Again by a Thousand Yuan The First Batch of Applicants Will Be Notified of Gold and Silver Collection Procedures in One Week</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday was a regular Sunday, but the Central Bank authorities decided to conduct gold and silver deposit and exchange business as usual at around 9 p.m. on the 8th, and temporarily notified all banks and treasuries to follow suit. However, the gold balancing fee was raised by another thousand yuan on the 8th. Depositors and exchangers of gold must pay a total of 9,000 yuan, including an exchange rate of 1,000 yuan, a deposit of 1,000 yuan, and a balancing fee of 7,000 yuan. Depositors and exchangers of silver dollars must pay a total of 90 yuan per yuan, including an exchange rate of 10 yuan, a deposit of 10 yuan, and a balancing fee of 70 yuan. The National Bank made the decision hastily, and even the news media were not widely notified, so fewer people knew about it. In addition, due to the holidays for the silver and money industry on Sundays, the supply of cash was also less, and the lines of people queuing up to collect application forms in front of the banks and treasuries were not as crowded as the previous two days. As a result, the National Bank issued 400 application forms, China 200, Communications 100, China Trust Bureau 50, the number for the Cooperative Treasury is unknown, and the Postal Remittance Bureau temporarily suspended issuing them for one day because colleagues were scattered everywhere and could not be notified in time. It is understood that in the future, each bank and treasury will continue to issue application forms as usual every Sunday, and Wednesday may still be the holiday for deposit and exchange work. A final decision can be made this Wednesday. In addition, according to regulations, those who applied for deposit and exchange of gold and silver and paid cash in the first batch (i.e., the 5th) will be notified of the procedures for collecting gold and silver in one week, so it is expected that the Central Bank will announce the gold collection procedures around the 12th or 13th.</p>
<p>Shipping Industry Has Difficulty Maintaining Operations Petitions the Executive Yuan for a Loan of 200 Million Determined to Send Representatives to Petition in Beijing Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, due to the extreme difficulty of shipping operations and the approaching Lunar New Year, when funds are not easy to turn around, yesterday submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Communications, requesting a loan of 200 million gold yuan from the National Bank to maintain operations. According to the person in charge of the association, the reasons for the difficulty in the shipping industry are: (1) Frequent military transportation, most ships are requisitioned, and the rent for requisitioned ships is extremely low, accounting for only one-thirtieth of the operating costs. The requisitioned fees are owed for one or two months, and when the payment is made, the value of the currency has depreciated several times. Furthermore, the loading of goods is slow, delaying the schedule and causing huge losses, so each time a ship is requisitioned, it is almost equivalent to no income and a complete loss. (2) During the evacuation period, each ship evacuated public educators and transported public property, and the return journey was mostly empty, resulting in huge losses. (3) Coal prices, oil prices, foreign exchange rates, and various commodity prices are constantly adjusted and fluctuating. Although shipping prices have been adjusted, they are often out of sync and lagging behind, resulting in significant losses. During the price limit period, the losses are even greater. (4) Insufficient allocation of coal and oil, which must be supplemented by the black market. The difference between the official price and the black market price is also a significant burden on the shipping companies. (5) Slack cargo transportation, large expenses, and no way to cut back, while freight income must be collected after transportation and is often delayed, while any expenses of the shipping company must be paid in cash. The depreciation of the currency and the interest burden all affect the turnover of funds, and the year-end payment of double pay is even more difficult. Due to the above factors, each shipping company is overwhelmed when it comes to purchasing fuel, materials, and paying salaries. It is estimated that each shipping company needs 420 million gold yuan for necessary expenses such as purchasing fuel, rice, and paying salaries during the Lunar New Year, and the cost of purchasing hardware, materials, insurance, and ship repairs has not yet been calculated. It is planned that each company will raise 220 million yuan, and the remaining 200 million yuan will be requested from the government to be loaned by the National Bank. It has been decided to send representatives such as Wei Wenhan, Li Yunliang, Zhong Shandao, and Shen Qi to Beijing tomorrow to petition.</p>
<p>Shipping Federation Sends Telegram Calling for Peace</p>
<p>The National Shipping Industry Federation yesterday sent a telegram calling for peace. The original telegram reads: "To President Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an, all national organizations, and all newspapers: Our people have long suffered from the bitterness of war. The same country, the same nation, the same writing. Even if there are different political beliefs, they can be resolved through consultation and negotiation. There is no need to resort to arms, causing the people to suffer the tragic fate of broken limbs, destroyed property, and broken families. Now that the President has a New Year's Day peace message, and Mr. Mao has always emphasized peace and is willing to cooperate with various parties, now is the time to turn hostility into friendship. We implore both sides to issue a ceasefire order immediately, designate a location, and reopen peace talks. This great act of turning the tide will be a blessing in history and a light in public opinion, preserving the complete mountains and rivers, spending a peaceful period, laying the foundation for construction, and nourishing the broken vitality. It only takes a change of heart from you all to realize this. You all value democracy, and public opinion tends towards peace. We implore you to accept it generously and approach it with calmness and tolerance. In the past, the martyrs of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had a poem that said: 'My ambitions have not been fulfilled, and the people are suffering. There are tears everywhere in the southeast.' Please allow us to recite it for you. We are all countrymen, victory is not martial, and concession is not humiliation. The rights and wrongs of a hundred generations will depend on whether or not we can make concessions today. We are writing this telegram with trepidation, and we implore you to consider it. Du Tang, Chairman of the National Shipping Industry Federation, and the shipping industry associations of Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Datong, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, Shashi, Wanxian, Chongqing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Zhenhai, Yin County, Yongjia, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Keelung, Shantou, Guangzhou, Shanghai Inland River, Changshu, Wu County, Wuxi, Bengbu, Nanchang, Changsha, Xiangtan, Wuzhou, Yongning, Ruian, Wuxing, Jiangyin, Liujiang, Linsen, and Wujin respectfully bow."</p>

<h3 id="e25">Preliminary Ideas on China's New Economic Policy <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Miancheng</p>
<p>Whether international or domestic wars, their direct causes, though complex and varied, all have their root causes in economics. The rebellion of the Chinese Communist Party, its superficial motive being to seize power, is still calling for economic reform; and its ability to sustain itself to this day also lies in economics. Therefore, the Chinese government should thoroughly reform the economy in order to achieve success in suppressing the rebellion and victory in peace. Otherwise, war is war, and people's livelihood is people's livelihood. If there is no certainty of victory in war, even victory is difficult to sustain. Therefore, I have drafted an outline of China's new economic policy to suggest to the authorities and to seek guidance from enlightened people.</p>
<p>First, China's new economic policy should take rationalization as the highest principle: China should determine its rational economic policy based on national conditions and with reference to the advantages of the economic policies of various countries. Capitalism, starting from individualism and self-interest competition, has great drawbacks and is not sufficient to be a model, but its successes can also be referenced. Communism, starting from collectivism, public ownership, and public operation, obliterates individuality and binds freedom, which is not very reasonable, but it is not without its advantages that can be adopted. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood originally sought to adopt the strengths of various systems and eliminate their weaknesses, but the methods were not very detailed, and due to factual changes, it is necessary to make appropriate revisions or supplements to fully meet the requirements of time and space.</p>
<p>If we want to seek the rationality of economic policy, in terms of space, it must be able to meet the different needs of various regions of the country. The situation in various parts of China is very different, and the cultural standards are different by several centuries. Therefore, the elasticity and adaptability of the economic system are extremely important. In terms of time, it must be able to gradually evolve and gradually improve. It cannot reach a highly modern state overnight, nor can it adopt an immutable system. In terms of society, it must be able to conform to the requirements of all the people or the largest number of people, and the interests of a few people must never be taken as a prerequisite. In terms of steps, it is necessary to distinguish between priorities and urgency, grasp the center of gravity, and select the important and urgent ones for serious implementation first.</p>
<p>I believe that China's new economic policy should especially strengthen the development of cooperative organizations and cooperative undertakings. Cooperative undertakings are democratic and socialized economic organizations, which have the benefits of private property economy and communist economy without their drawbacks. They should also have elasticity to adapt to the needs and capabilities of different times and different spaces. It is the most rational economic system. If cooperative organizations are used in rural areas, they can strengthen farmers' organizations, solve the distribution of agricultural land, and develop the rural economy; if they are used in cities, they can also improve the status of workers, develop the industrial economy, strengthen consumer groups, and facilitate price control.</p>
<p>Second, China's new economic policy must be more fair and reasonable than communism and more economically effective than capitalism in order to be successful: The Chinese Communist Party's call for land revolution and the liquidation of local despots has made the wealthy fearful and evasive, while the extremely poor, though unaware of what communism is, often blindly follow it because they believe it will benefit them. In fact, there are not many people in China who truly understand the communist system, and there are even fewer who have the ability to implement it. The situation on the capitalist side is similar. They only know how to follow the example of Britain and the United States, thinking that as long as the government does not regulate private enterprises and allows them to develop freely, a capitalist system like that of Britain and the United States can be formed. In fact, there are probably not many capitalists in China today who truly have the ability to build a capitalist system. However, if we do not actively work to establish a new economic system that is more fair and reasonable than communism and more economically effective than capitalism, and only know how to passively oppose it, it will be difficult to achieve results and may even lead to the failure of military suppression of the rebellion.</p>
<p>Third, China's new economic policy must take planned control as the main method and should immediately formulate and implement a long-term plan: The government has previously formulated a five-year plan, but because various conditions were not met, it resulted in nothing. The first condition for planned construction is the spirit of creation. The government must have the creative spirit of destroying the old system and building a new system to achieve a certain ideal, and then planned construction can succeed. Secondly, planned construction also requires the condition of a scientific spirit. It must be very objective, very detached, very precise, very concrete, very realistic, and very able to grasp the key points so that the executors can truly implement it according to the plan and be effective. Planned construction also requires a spirit of practice. In other words, once there is a plan, it must be controlled and executed. If the plan does not match the facts, it must be revised at any time. After the revision, it must still be controlled and executed until the construction goal is achieved.</p>
<p>Fourth, the construction of each department and the implementation of planned control by governments at all levels must be closely connected and coordinated: I advocated above that implementing key plans and關統制can be illustrated with several examples. Increasing the production of grain and cotton can be implemented as a key plan. The construction of railways and waterways can also be implemented as a key plan. To implement these key plans, it is necessary to control their main key points. For example, seeds, fertilizers, water conservancy, and agricultural tools are the key to increasing grain and cotton production; steel, fuel, and wood are the key to railway and waterway construction. However, these key points must be coordinated by various departments and governments at all levels in order to complete the control according to the plan. For example, land system, price system, banking system, and education system are all closely related to these constructions. If they are disconnected from each other, there will be no planned construction, and even if construction is possible, there will be no work efficiency to speak of.</p>
<p>Fifth, to implement the new economic policy, it is necessary to adopt new economic education to change the general social concepts and atmosphere: At present, the general society mostly holds individualism, worship of money, selfishness, and endless competition. In this atmosphere, it is impossible to implement a rationalized new economy. Secondly, the disconnection between education and career is also a major defect. Those who study agriculture disdain to engage in agriculture, and those who study industry disdain to work in industry, and are only willing to be employees of institutions, which has completely lost the function of economic education. Therefore, China's education needs to be thoroughly reformed. In terms of spirit, we must earnestly cultivate the concept and habit of mutual assistance and cooperation among students at all levels, emphasizing public interests and downplaying private interests; in terms of skills, we must teach students the practical skills of farming and working, and all teaching materials must be suitable for China's actual needs. Western materials can only be used for reference and cannot be selected as teaching materials. Students studying abroad, except for a few students, should focus on field trips and submit field trip reports. In terms of responsibility, all graduates of practical subjects must engage in practical work and must not arbitrarily change careers or concentrate on taking public office in institutions.</p>
<p>Sixth, to implement the new economic policy, it is necessary to mobilize social forces to cooperate with the government to promote it: The implementation of the new economic policy is related to every department of people's lives and every corner of the country, and it must have places where it conflicts with the interests of feudal forces. Therefore, it is difficult to thoroughly implement or fully promote it by relying solely on government laws and regulations. Under a one-party dictatorship, the organization of the party can still be used; under a multi-party political situation, perhaps the destruction of the opposition party is necessary. Therefore, mobilizing social forces to jointly promote it is an indispensable condition. This kind of work of launching and uniting social forces can be carried out in the form of a new economic policy promotion association.</p>
<p>Seventh, to implement the new economic policy, we should promote work competitions, technical guidance, and reward scientific inventions to increase economic efficiency: My country's technology is backward, and capital is lacking. To increase work efficiency, we must promote work competitions, technical guidance, and reward inventions. These tasks have been tried out by party and government agencies, but the results are poor. The problem seems to be that they have no real understanding of the work, and there is no concrete plan to match. For example, when I was in Chongqing, I remember that printing workers held a competition for typesetting speed. The speed of printing can be said to be irrelevant, but can holding a competition be said to be a matter of urgency? Technical guidance is relatively more recognized, but the scope is small and the benefits are very limited. In the past, awards for inventions were only given after the fact, and there was no active encouragement and cultivation beforehand. Moreover, invention cannot only rely on individual free activities, but must rely on the collective actions of institutions and groups. This is even more difficult to achieve, and is also its shortcoming.</p>
<p>Eighth, to implement the new economic policy, we must strictly reward and punish. Those who have contributed to promoting the new policy will be rewarded, and those who have committed crimes that hinder the new policy will be punished: There are many laws and regulations in our country for implementing the new policy, but they lack revolutionary provisions. However, even in terms of existing laws and regulations, many are regarded as empty words and have little effect. The lack of clarity in the reward and punishment methods themselves is one of the reasons, and the failure to seriously implement the rewards and punishments is an important reason. Our society rarely encourages those who work hard, and even deliberately destroys them because of excluding dissidents, which is even more counterproductive. (Specific methods omitted)</p>
<p>The eight principles described above are all aimed at ensuring that everyone has a life and that everyone's life can be gradually improved. China has a large land and a lot of labor, and China's materials are also needed by foreign countries, and can be used to exchange for foreign machinery and technology. The only things that can hinder us from implementing the new economy to improve everyone's life are the destruction of war, the laziness and selfishness of the people, and the lack of revolutionary decision-making and revolutionary ability of the country. If China wants to survive in the present world, and wants everyone to enjoy the benefits that mankind has, then it must seek the direction of our country's new economic system on the road to rationalization and socialization, which is undeniable.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 8th] A Chinese-run English newspaper here reports:</p>
<p>The production rate of overseas Chinese in 1948 set the highest record in a century. There were 763 births in Chinese hospitals alone, including 390 males and 373 females. Since Chinese hospitals usually only handle 60% of the Chinese babies born here, there should be over 1,000 babies born in this situation. The newspaper said: The large number of wartime Chinese wives entering the country is one of the reasons for the surge in production. More than 1,000 people have entered the district. The number of people entering the country in the past two years is the largest number of Chinese women entering the country since 1880. The black market for gold and silver has rebounded.
