<p>社論</p>
<h3>和談的心理基礎</h3>
<p>顏息慶邵力子章士釗江庸四位和平老人，昨日下午巴由北平飛回南京，發表書面談話，大意是說他們「深覺和談前途雖困難尙多，而希望甚大」。有此結果，總算四位老人不虛此半月之行。他們爲全國和平做的「推門工作」，不但可吿慰於李代總統，即京滬兩地市民及全國人民當亦感謝他們的不辭跋涉之勞。</p>
<p>在這半個月間，李代總統除了作過一次整肅官常軍紀的重要廣播外，也曾作了一次南巡，徧歷粵桂湘鄂四省省會，將他力謀全面和平的最大誠意和無限信心，昭吿各地官民。他有幾句最動人聽聞的話，就是：「今天必須國民黨全體同志澈頭澈尾，檢討失敗因素，失敗爲成功之母，未可灰心，希望　致團結，求得眞正和平。……我們決不是爲少數人名位，而是爲四萬萬同胞達到眞正和平的目的」。現在，李代總統回京了，行政院孫院長也可於今日飛京了，其他各地大員且都先後紛紛被邀入京了，日內首都將有極重要的會商；當然，和談如何進行的問題應該是當道權要會商的第　課題。</p>
<p>我們站在人民立塲，渴望和平，自必超過於雙方的任何當道，聽到了和平老人們「困難雖多。希望甚大」的話，不能不先誠懇地祈求雙方，趕緊努力於和談實現以前種種困難的克服工作。克服困難的最主要工作，莫過於共同建設和談的心理基礎。</p>
<p>天下事，不論大小，其動機無不由於人們最初的一念。這一念，就是一個人乃至一羣人的心理趨向。心之所之謂之志，有志者事竟成。故作戰則有作戰的意志，謀和須有謀和的意志。我們相信李代總統在蔣總統毅然引退以求和平之後，忍辱負重，繼續求取和平的實現，是確實具有謀和的意志的。其在中共方面，自中共主席毛澤東先生以次的諸先生亦與四位和平老人廣泛交換和平問題的意見，可見也同樣有謀和的意志的。旣然雙方都具有謀和的意志，則不問在千迴百折的過程中所可能遭遇的種種困難，如何的多，我們總希望雙方當局必須站在堅强的心理基礎上去克服它們。然則雙方當局對於和談的心理基礎，應該拿那些村料建築起來呢？我們以爲公·容·忍·悲四個大字，就是和談的心理基礎。</p>
<p>第一，要能「公」。國民黨宣傳的三民主義，爲的是要救國救民；共產黨目前所號召的新民主主義，爲的是要「解放」人民。果眞都是爲民，最好沒有，爲民就是公，爲己就是私。惟能「公」纔能「共」；綫能「和」；不公又何能「共」，何能「和」？只要眞能公，沒有人願意反對。只要眞公正的爲人民，對一切善良的人民毫無歧視，沒有不可以得到對方的諒解與人民的愛戴。只要眞能做到如李代總統所說，「不是爲少數人名位而是爲四萬萬同胞」，在這樣大公的態度之下，自無黨派恩怨之可言。果爾，則政府固應貫澈其七項措施的執行，而中共也不必在其轄區內捕戰犯，對報館了。故從「公」這　點出發，則雙方所提的條件，當然都可以放在「是否爲人民？」這一座大平上去秤一秤，而且相信一切疑慮都可望其渙然冰釋，立刻做到停戰談和。這在水深火熱中的人民，是何等受益啊！</p>
<p>第二。　　「容」。旣然要謀和，當然要知己知彼，要自利利他，尤共要利益一切人民。惟共如此，在謀和的過程中，雙方當道必須放大胸襟，客受對方的合理意見，更當容受人民的合理要求。李代總統在漢口所說希望國民黨在一些，共產黨右一些，大槪就是近乎休休有容的精神了。儒家所說，「萬物並育而不相害」，「共默足以零」？「母固母我」等等，就是敎人不可存着惟我獨尊的念頭，不可膠執一己的偏見而抹煞一切，至於佛法，更是倡導大容而特容的，所謂「一一毛端，悉能容受一切世界而無障礙」，就是比喻無邊的容量的。但願雙方當局，時時爲四萬萬人民高想，爲人民故，先有容受一切異見的大量，然後爲平心靜氣的商討，以調伏一切異見，而獲得執兩用中的理想境界。這纔能做到真正的和平。</p>
<p>第三，要能「忍」。「小不忍則亂大謀」是人人知道的古訓、而中國人幾千年來更是養成了能忍的美德。和平將軍張冶中也許就有「百忍堂」的傳家秘寶和圮上受害的千古遺風。今天雙方當局，果眞有不忍人之心，行不忍人之政，那麼除了大家放下武器，抱頭痛哭，向老百姓面前懺悔而外，還有何說？而況，在有二十年鬥爭歷史的兩黨，一日雙方想放下屠刀，當然受不了相罵無好口」，更需要有「忍辱」的大德，安然處之而不以爲怪，然後可望駡街式的宣傳戰可以有烟消雲散的一天。蔣總統引退前後，這些年來，一直到現在，受盡種種辱駡，今天息隱林泉，無官一身輕，而對辱駡絕不作片詞隻字的聲辯是深得忍字訣的。李代總統儘管被詆爲美國陰謀的傀儡，而始終致力於謀和，也很得能忍三昧的。原來人有血氣，感情衝動，忍爲最難，故佛經說，「能行　者，乃可名爲有力大人」，須知和平的最大障礙，　　　　，就是雙方瞋恨憤怒的情緒；倘不盡力調伏這種　緒。和平是很雜實現的。而治瞋的方法，佛法就指出　個　定　字，要定必先能忍。金剛經云：「知一切法無我　得成於忍」。華嚴經云：「通達此忍門，成就無疑智」。所以雙方眞要謀和，果能各自克制自己，做到這個忍字，那一定可以生出「爲國爲民」的大智　來，　轉和平的成功。</p>
<p>第四，要能「悲」。我們要籲請雙方當局，放眼看看可憐　憫　人民，發出大悲心來，一切爭議到會塲上去爭，不要再動槍砲在戰塲上厮殺了！華嚴經說：　　切衆生而爲樹根，諸佛菩薩而爲華果；以大悲水饒益衆生，則能成就諸佛菩薩智慧華果。……若無衆生，一切菩薩終不能成無上正覺　。這一段話，正可用以說明人民與政府當局間的關係，若無人民，則政府就不能成其爲政府！而政府當局之於人民，就該對人民發出大悲心來，如　嚴經所說，「於諸病苦，爲作良醫；於失道者，示其正路；於閱夜中，爲作光明；於貧窮者，令得伏藏。菩薩如是平等饒益切衆生」，然後人民親之愛之，有如父母，決不會怨之恨之如寇仇，或畏之避之如蛇蝎了。但願雙方當局，尤其中共當局，念念想到人民遭受多年戰禍的創鉅痛深，難道還忍心再使他們受砲火的洗禮嗎？所謂「解放」人民者，其本意當在爲人民减輕痛苦：所謂「保衛」人民者，其本意當在爲人民爭取生存。這都楚出發於悲天憫人的一念。果眞雙方發此大悲的菩提心，念念不忘人民，念念搭救人民，那眞如和平老人們所設，「困難雖多，希望甚大」的了。</p>
<h3>程潛與英報記者一席談　李代總統過湘時所談各題意見一致　中共對和談很難判斷是否有誠意</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙廿七日電〕倫敦觀察報記者杜魯凡，由穗抵長，廿七日訪程主席，提出甚多問題，程氏一一答覆。</p>
<p>問：李代總統蒞湘與主席談話內容，能否見　？彼此意見是否一致？</p>
<p>答：李代總統與本人所談大抵為有關和平及政府本身應力加改革諸問題，意見完全相同，惟內容甚多未臻發表時期，未便奉吿</p>
<p>問：中共是否誠意談和？</p>
<p>答：中共是否誠意談和，一時很難判斷，本人以爲中共可能具有誠意，但其誠意與我們的有所不同，也卽是設中共是要一切合乎其要求，否則恐難會有誠意。</p>
<p>問：如中共對和平無誠意，屆時華南諸省如粤桂湘贛等省，將否另行構成一政府，以與華北的中共政府相抗衡？</p>
<p>答：這種情形自前恐怕不會有，萬一和平不成，南方人民仍然希望和平，李代總統絕對遵從人民這種股切求和的願望，祗要有利於促成和平，政府方面仍然不惜讓步，如中共的目的另有所指，和平萬一不能成功。那時李代總統或將代表南方人民的願望，另作部署，不過現在尙未敢斷定</p>
<p>問：湘圭地改革運動現狀如何？未來對此抱負如何？</p>
<p>答：本省限租業已實行，因技術方面尙有若干缺點，未能盡如理想，本人決心必期於年內澈底完成；至於限田，刻正縝密計劃中，惟本人對土改是採溫和手段，類似英國費邊社會主義的辦法，絕非出之淸算鬥爭屠殺等手段</p>
<p>問：傳蔣總統可能在穗復職，繼續領導政府，主席對此意想如何？</p>
<p>答：對此一問題本人無甚觀感，不過就我個人根據一般民情的看法，此項傳說或許是一般希望蔣總統復職的人們的一致希望，但國民黨內的進步份子和全國人民一致需要和平，蔣總統如果一旦復職，無異象徵和平絕望，繼續與中共作最後鬥爭，此則將爲全國人民所堅決反對。</p>
<p>問：主席與政院孫院長公務關係如何！</p>
<p>答：自孫內閣成立以來，湘雀府甚少接到他的公文指示，但省府向政院請示的公文則甚多，惟迄未接到復示。</p>
<p>杜魯凡自英來華，爲時僅兩月，在長事畢，定廿八日晨循浙贛路赴南昌轉杭返滬。</p>

<h3>江淮魯南地區近況　人民生活並未劇變</h3>
<p>建設極少瘡痍未復</p>
<p>〔華明社上海訊〕年前共軍佔領之江淮地區及魯南交界一帶，人民生活狀况並未劇變，刻已有來人加以證實。據彼描述當地最近情形有稱：由於去冬天氣較溫，徐州附近未臨泛災，目前雨水不缺，野菜滋長，今後數月內尙可聊以充飢，惟缺乏種子下種，故近乎饑荒之現象業已普及。地方因細於經費，極少建設，致舊有戰跡猶存，公共建築物大多均未修葺，損毀不堪。蚌埠之淮河鐵橋，有五橋洞，聞係為撤退之國軍所自動破壞。而該地區共方所派之行政人員，據說僅少數爲受完整敎育或富有經騐者，衆多靑年已被編送共方之若干「訓練學校」，以加速學習有關行政或宣傳工作之課程，某一新被共軍佔領之城市，竟有四百敎員主持此項一月速成之犬衆課程。雖普通之學校均已開學，然不論其私立與否，概頓出演宣傳性質之劇本，以及參加共黨之民眾大會，在此等大會中，人民常被灌輸生活刻苦而好鬥之思想，而所有宣傳常取材於反美之資料。一般較大之城市，能閔及共黨文藝出版品，「江淮日報」卽其中之一，該報用拼音字母，（卽所謂「澳字拉丁化」）；共方認爲此係中國新聞學界別開生　而富有價値之新方針。共軍部隊在城區者紀律尙佳，而駐紥於鄕鎭者，頗多使用民物祗價不還之事。該地區共軍　行之紙幣甚爲紊雜。正常之郵　迄未在該地區建立。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播：曼谷訊：暹羅總理宋格蘭元帥寓所左近，今日突有陸軍控制之袋甲軍部隊與海軍控制之砲兵發生激戰，至午間始息。當時陸軍方面之電台廣播稱，宋格蘭元帥麾下之部隊業已赦平「反動份子之叛亂」，而海軍電台則稱，陸軍意圖「阻撓海軍搪行職務，業已發生慘烈戰事」。警察頃已佔領郵局，曼谷對外無綫電訊及空運已全部停止。按暹羅當局曾於上星期四起宣布戒嚴，翌日宋格蘭卽宣稱：當局發現政變陰謀，意圖　　政府，頃已採取行動，予以全部赦平。當局並宣稱，已於星期四五二日逮捕疑犯廿四人，其中三人為暹伍軍官，一人係華人。並稱該嫌疑犯係共黨份子。暹報並謂此等陰謀份子，曾從某外國得到經濟援助。惟此項宣布後四十八小時，突有人侵入電台廣播，謂前任暹羅駐英大使傑牙那　已繼宋格蘭為總理。接傑氏係「自由泰國運動」之重要份子。但廣播忽又中斷，至再度播音時，又稱宋格蘭仍爲總理，以前之廣播係不法份子所爲。今日發生砲戰後，人心極爲不安。</p>

<h3>西歐聯合防禦侵略　保持軍力三百萬　預料艾帥將任最高策劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿六日電〕據探悉：在北大西洋公約簽訂後，美國某軍事將領可能係艾森豪威爾將軍，將担任計劃大西洋及西歐防務的最高軍事職位·西歐希望此項發展，大部份西默國家均願意如此，同時許多美官員認爲在美國簽訂公約及開始輸送軍械至西歐後，此舉將爲唯一合乎邏輯的解決。艾帥爲傳將出任總司令或主席的呼聲最高的人物，由於渠之被召回華盛頓，在討論軍火援助西歌之際，暫時出任聯合參謀總部主席，更刺激了此項揣測。北大西洋公約將團結西默國家，在承平時期保持三百萬人以上的軍力，採取聯合防衛，俾能應付任何突然來自東方的攻擊。西歐五國早已建立聯合軍事委會，對共同防衛擬定初步計劃，渠等之軍力總額達一百五十六萬七千人，同時據稱，渠等正計劃建立五十師約五十萬人的聯合機械化部隊。在公約簽訂後，美國及加拿大將分別以一百六十六萬五千三百人及三萬九千人的軍力，在歷史性的最大承平時期同盟中，參加西歐集團。</p>

<p>西歐及美軍事專家指出，何以美國將領將爲大西洋公約中最高軍事長官的合理人選之理由如次</p>
<p>（一）美國將供給西歐防務的軍火；（二）美國將保持對空軍戰略司令部中任何事務的控制權。（三）僅有美國將領能不爲本國爭取更多的軍火。</p>
<p>據悉，在福頓勃魯所擬定極度秘密的西歐聯盟防衛計劃，其大概情形爲　　從荷蘭海岸直至瑞士邊界的防綫，在統一指揮下。由五國供給機械化部隊防守。據非官方報吿指出，法國在裝甲部隊中，將負担卅五個機械化師及五個裝甲師，比利時及荷蘭各自撥出三個師，再加上若干小股兵力，其中每國包括約十二個戰鬥騎兵中隊。</p>

<h3>歐陸局勢雖極緊張　國際戰爭暫可避免　一九四八年東西關係總檢討</h3>
<p>— 薩本耿</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>這裏不是想說明一年來歐洲大陸各國內部的情形，而是想檢討一下一年來歐陸的國際形勢。</p>
<p>一九四八年的歐陸形勢，幾乎可以說是打了一年的「冷戰」。東西兩集團的對峙愈來愈尖銳，在最嚴重的時候，好像是就要化「冷戰」爲「熱戰」。雖則歐陸總算又渡了和平的一年。</p>
<p>這種東西對峙的局勢，雖則種因複雜而長遠，但由去年一年來講，實開始於一九四七年年底四國倫敦會議關於對德和約問題之破裂。這個四國會議之破裂，雖非開始，但的確是加强並加速了英美組織西歐集團的決心與步驟。這個決心與步驟，又加强並加速了蘇聯的防備，而東西之「冷戰」，愈來也愈猛烈。</p>
<p>我們從頭說起、</p>
<p>在四國對德會議破裂之後的不久，卽去年正月二十二日，英國外相貝文在英國下院發表了一篇很重要的有關外交的演說，他說明四强合作政策已經中斷，「西歐的自由國家現在必須密切聯合。」他提出了「西歐聯盟』的政策，認爲這將是一個各國政府的自動結合，以討論實際的經濟與軍事問題，並且說是英·法·荷蘭·比利時及盧森堡五個國家已經開始商討。接貝文演說而來的，一方面是二月二十五日之捷克政變，它方面是三月十七日英·法·荷·比·盧五國白魯塞爾條約之簽訂。捷克政變的結果，爲共黨在捷克力量之加强與鞏固。五國條約的太質，由某一意義說來，是一種對付蘇聯或東歐集團之防守同盟。根據五國條約的規定，一方面是五國經濟合作，它方面是五國共同承認假定五國之一在歐洲受到軍事攻擊之時，必須立卽互相援助，同時五國並且同意成立一個永久的聯絡會議的組織。但是，這個五國條約，假定沒有美國及加拿大的參加，其作用是很有限的。美國的歷史習慣，雖然並非不參加國際集團，但是沒有參加對外同盟條約的先例。這一次，在六月間，由參議院通過了一個所謂范登堡提案，敦促美國政府參加國際區域安全協定。這個議案的本身，不是條約，但是這是共和黨上議院所通過的，它加强了民主黨政府對外交涉的信心與地位，使杜魯門總統知這他不至於做威爾遜第二。（當時杜魯門總統當然不能確定到了年底不但自己連任總統，而且有了民主黨的國會，當時他的外交政策，事實上必須共和黨同意的）因之，在七月間，美國，加拿大，與五國就開始討論如何聯繫西歐與北美，同時派遣「觀察者」出席五國的軍事會議。所謂「如何聯繫」，就是現在尙在醖釀中之「北大西洋公約」。而在同時，「對外援助法」（卽實現平常所熱聞的馬歇爾計劃或歐洲復興計劃之美國國內法）。經於完成了美國的　　程序，於四月三日由杜魯門總統簽　。此法成立之後，歐洲十六個受援國家，立卽集議於巴黎，成立了「歐洲經濟合作組織」，這些都不是姿　　而是在以美國或英美爲領導之下的　付東歐的具體辦法。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>冷戰之表現得最緊張的，尙不在此。最精彩的一幕，在於德國，在這裏，是東西兩集團狹路相逢的地帶，</p>
<p>如上所言，對德問題，平已於去年四國會議中宣吿破裂，這個破裂它增加了去年一年國際間的若干矛盾，而量直接的，當然還是德國本身。</p>
<p>早在去年二月，卽四國會議破裂沒多久，英美法三國卽在倫敦開始討論三國在德國之佔領區問題。其後由荷比廬三國參加，自春至夏，於六月七日公布了六國協定。這個協定涉及魯爾之國際共管，德國之參加歐洲復興計劃；英美法在德佔領區之合併，德國聯邦政府之建立等等。最重要者，一方面是把比荷盧也拉進來，它方面決定在德國統一（卽東西德國合併）以前，先成立一個西部的臨時德國政府。此外，英美法三國並且於六月十八日宣佈將在其佔領區之內（柏林部份除外），實行貨幣改。（六月二十日寬現）蘇聯方面的對策，是於六月十九日起開始禁止蘇聯佔領區與西方各國佔領區間之車輛交通，柏林由四國分區佔領，但因整個柏林是位置在蘇聯佔領區之內的關係，禁止蘇聯佔領區與西方各國佔領區的車輛交通，等於封鎖柏林英美法三國的佔領區對外交通。六月二十三日蘇聯方面又公布了東歐各國外長會議的宣言，　責六國公約爲分裂德國。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>封鎖交通，在蘇聯方而自信認爲對付西德貨幣改革之所必需的手段。實際上，蘇聯大約也希望由此而對德國問題有一解決。但雙方幷沒有能够立卽有所協議，接着是蘇聯宣佈東德貨幣亦將改革，西德部份則將西德新幣擴辦柏林佔領區，面蘇聯之封鎖交通亦愈爲嚴密。英美爲了維持柏林佔領區之日常生活，不能不利用大量空運（據云每日平均約四千噸運量）。同時，英美法三國政府鑒於這個問題已不足佔領區軍事當局所能解決，乃直接對莫斯科交涉。三國代表在莫斯科會見蘇聯外次柴林（Zorin）外長莫洛托夫及史達林氏。在八月卅日得到了一個原則的同意，卽開放交通同，時將蘇聯佔領區之德幣，爲柏林之唯一貨幣。關於四國共同管理柏林貨幣之具體辦法，則交與四國在柏林之軍事當局商議。在商議妥當之後，立卽實施。但是爲了四國軍事當局對於這個協議的解釋不同，蘇聯軍事當局索科洛夫斯基認爲蘇聯具有柏林對外航空交通的管理權。經過數度的商議，朱能有一致的同意。九月二十六日，英美法三國政府通知蘇聯當局將此事提交聯合國安全理事會。四個國家所不能解決的問題，到了安全理事會也未必有更好的辦法。（這四個國家在安全理事會都有否決權，換言之。如果沒有這四國的共同同意，則議案無法通過），是以雖則協商再三，安全理事會的議案，以蘇聯之否決，而未能通過。不寗唯是，柏林自十一月卅日起且有了兩個市政府。分裂加深，僵局繼續維持。十二月初，北大西洋公約草案由五國送至華盛頓與美加二國商議，五國同時又指派了一個委員會在巴黎商議加强與擴大聯合的方法。除此之外，在歐陸，國際意味極濃之希臘內戰，幷未停止，多瑙河問題，對於以前之意大利殖民地問題，以及對奧和約問題，都不知何時可以有一實行的辦法。不過這些問題，如果與柏林問題比較，都成了不是最嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>看看去年，想想今年，則今年的形勢，不見得會比去年好。東方集團繼續着原有的對內對外政策。西方集團則將加強其本身的組織，利用馬歇爾計劃下的美元，來復蘇各國的經濟。東西的對立，大約已到了無可再尖銳的情形，戰爭之是否可能爆發，恐怕誰也不敢作肯定的預測。如果用當理來推論的話，大約不會有戰事發生。世界上够得上有資格談戰爭的國家，在現在只有兩個，這兩個够格的國家，未必想馬上打，並且地理上距離得這麽遠，站在這個距離內的若干國家，都是沒辦法打起來的。粕林問題說明了歐陸局勢之緊張與東西間之不易協調，但也說明了國際戰爭在短期內不會爆發。只要有一面想打，大約早已打起來了。大家都希望不戰而勝，戰爭在此種局勢之下，是打不起來的，這是去年的情形，可能今年也仍然如此。</p>

<p>警局刑事處長孫達方據報，呈報兪局長後，飭靜安寺警分局限期破案。當由正副分局長王華臣，嚴祥鵠，飭荊事股長兪鼎嚴密偵查。兪股長以案情重大，特召開全體刑事員警會議，遴選精幹警員葉志江·楊震中·陸天江·楊俊卿·黃嘉祺·鄭繼文·梁光裕·宋世驤·吳禮權·金毓麒等組特別班，並由巡官孟瑞生，督率各警專司其事。兪股長卽親偕孟巡官至華山路喬神父處調査眞情，及探求綫索，並囑喬謂彼等來電話時，須虛與委蛇，暗中與局方隨時聯絡。兪等返局後，卽出動大批幹警在各犯出入塲所及各大旅社守侯。至十五日午後二時，有羽黨勃拉受克利柯之囑，致電與喬，約其在常熱路林森中路附近交付餘款，警局兪股長得訊，即偕孟巡官等化裝至該處守候，而喬則派神父（比人）艾白德威士代表前往接洽。屆時因該處轉角之恩派亞咖啡館門口適停有軍用吉普卡一輛，爲彼等所疑忌，不敢接洽。諸員警直至薄暮六時半始離去。</p>
<p>又來電話約時繳款</p>
<p>七時許。喬又接對方電話，指喬已報警務當局，謂如三萬元餘款不交，定要結果他性命。並謂今晚八時在敎堂附近相會。喬托詞是夜有宴會，請待明日。迨至翌晨八時，又來電話。詢問款子曾否凖備，復稱，此次接洽地點爲流動性的場合，隨時有人在爾後面跟隨，定於下午二時由庽所出發，途經華山路長樂路聖喬奇花園舞廳緩步前進，假如無人上前接洽，則向社美路方面前進，至林森路爲止。喬神父聆語後，乃績派艾神父馳報警局，經兪股長等硏究地形，佈下羅網，由幹負陸長江喬裝自備三輪車夫，載兪股長之公子赴校上踝，在長樂路浦東中學竚侯。巡佐葉志江，警員黃嘉祺，楊俊卿，徐建等分扮報販小販，另有警員金毓祺，鄭繼文，携兪股長兩女公子慧運筱連僞爲靑年友侶，手挾書本，在附近徘徊散步，作爲掩護。</p>
<p>杜美路上擒獲白俄</p>
<p>三時四十分許，天空適有飛機盤旋，化裝警員佯作仰天觀望，忽瞥見杜美路上艾之身傍，有白俄愛蓋向其接談，艾卽與之敷衍，此將美鈔一千五百元交彼。迨愛步至林森中路口，由預伏之兪股長孟巡官等上前，將其擒住，通同原贓，一併帶局，供認係受克之囑托。警員據供，赴國泰大戯院附近拘克未獲。</p>
<p>同時奮局聽取愛蓋供詞，得悉西僑靑年會會收得空十頭支票一紙，如存戶許慶國所出。警員卽往調査，確有其事，經至銀行査明許之住址，傳許詢問，據謂此票係在事前被人竊去，頗疑係同居王顯章所爲，因王與外人交接頻　云云，警員將王拘案，一鞠而服，並又供認串同向喬神父嚇詐等案。</p>
<p>五犯供認案供十起</p>
<p>其後承辦警員又在各大旅社守候搜索，在二日後，卒在南京西路二〇〇四號樂義飯店二〇六，二一〇號房間，將克利柯，伊列茲，吉美，先後拘獲，其餘比波等則仍在逃。並經傳同室之美籍少年洛克到局作證，供出彼等計議不法經過，各犯始俯首無詞。警局除通緝在逃同黨外，並將所獲克等五人，以栽贓冒充公務員恐嚇詐財及偽造文書等罪，移送地檢處法辦。所犯各案，共計十起：（一）爲上述之共同敲詐喬神父，（二）去年十一月十七日向杜美路十八號白老琪校長（法人）以兜售麵粉白糖食油爲由，騙款潛逃，（三）在同日以同樣方法向中正中路一一五七號法教授白勞派司脫克騙款。（四）本年一月十九日向韓籍商人梁在一騙得項珠二串及白蘭地酒。（五）同月十八日在愚園路百樂門飯店虧欠房金一萬元，開空頭支票欺騙。（六）同月廿八日在南京西路一四七二號CPC咖啡館飲咖啡並購咖啡六磅，開付大通銀行空頭支票一紙。（七）本月七日，住南京西路一五〇號西僑靑年會虧欠房金膳費八萬六千餘元，支付新華大來銀行支票，到期退票。（八）本月十七日替德人音樂師克拉德出售衣服爲由，詐騙衣服而逸。（九）以壞酒及假英金鎊向比、商人白克　內騙得美金一百五十元。（十）在逃之同黨比波以假支票一紙向英商人湯潑孫兌現美金二百元逃逸無踪。</p>

<h3>哀物理權威　療養歿異域　中研院學者畢集　開會追悼薩本棟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕故中央硏究院總幹事物理學權威薩本棟博士患癌症赴美就醫不臺，病歿異邦，中央研究院同人及學術教育各界名流，昨晨九時在在岳陽路該院禮堂舉行追悼大會。出席朱家驊，梅眙琦，胡適，吳有訓，張元濟，莊長恭，杭立武，杜佐周，任鴻雋，周同慶，吳俊升，李拔可，楊綽庵，王之卓，沈希濂，趙曾珏，及該院各所所長，全體同人，薩氏親友等數百人。禮堂正面懸掛薩氏遺像，下為家屬祭文，前一長桌，供銀燭一付，香爐一具，台上供鮮花一瓶，花碟四事，並靑菓三盤。台旁陳列花圈無數，四壁掛滿各界輓聯。遺像旁爲朱家驊氏輓聯，文云：「痛匝月成永別，緬想中山問疾，龍華揮手，易地療沉疴，原冀回春總有術。憶三載相匡扶，深欽才華蓋世，英異絕倫，搔首問蒼天，胡竟靳我以斯人。」王世杰，杭立武輓云：「君去何忙，海外音書驚噩夢。天胡不弔，滬江嗚咽寫哀思。」任鴻雋晚云：「立言立功，伏枕著書眞健者，治學治事，窮薪傳火更何人。」中央硏究院物理所輓云：「看江山一片，狼烟到處，荆棘滿地，學術硏究何從說，願英靈飛渡重洋，歸來呵護九華麓。長物所兩載，心血嘔盡，勞怨祖遍，數理盡忠未竟功，知先生抱疴異械，臨終飲恨舊金山。」</p>
<h3>兩路新運價下月起實行突擊檢查嚴禁無票搭車</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬區鐵路管理同自經政院南遷，疏散公敎人員及大量電運，行車秩序以及一切原有辦事系統，均呈紊亂，客貨運輸一度幾瀕完全停頓，所有車輛什九撥作軍公運輸，在此時期內，路局收入方面蒙受極大損失，其後又接連發生工潮，迭次動亂之結果，造成今日兩路空前之經濟危機。該局局長王兆槐爲解救此項危機，毅然決然於本月十二日自動調整客貨運價四倍，滿以爲開源成功，一切問題均可迎刃而解，但却不然，運價雖增加四倍，實際收入尙不足增加二倍，據該局發言人分析此中原因有二：（一）人民經濟力量普遍低落，並在近十年來火車運　不及一般物價甚遠，公衆已習慣於低運價，故每次客票初經調整，旅客必見减少。（二）戰火逼近京滬區，兩路沿綫駐軍大增，火車中無票軍人乘客，有時竟超過普通旅客，更有一部份不法軍人兼營單帮，夾帶「黃魚」，近更發現少數路局員工，竟亦參預其事。此時路局收入方面打擊頗鉅。兩路當局鑑於上述第一項原因，故對交通部規定之公式化調整運價，如合組檢査組，會同警備司令部及各軍　單位，隨時施行突擊檢査，嚴禁路局員工及軍人夾帶「黃魚」及各種無票乘客，一經査獲，將予嚴厲處置云。</p>
<h3>朱家驊致悼詞頌揚薩氏功績</h3>
<p>九時開會，奏哀樂，行禮如儀，主席朱家驊獻花圈，中央研究院，廈門大學校友會，福建同鄕會相繼致祭，並宣讀祭文後，由朱家致悼詞，朱氏追述薩博士担任中央研究院總幹事經過，頌揚薩氏盡力發展研究院工作及在南京艱苦創設數理化中心的成就，報吿薩氏息病赴美就醫的情形。並稱：「薩先生對於科學方面的貢獻非常之大，他的去世，對科學的前途講，對國家方面講，都是極大的損失。上星期本院開院務會議，決定將新建數理化中心的物理實驗館改名爲本棟館。此外，想等幣制穩定後，設立一種本棟獎學金以爲紀念。薩先生遺囑將骨灰送給淸華大學，或廈門大學，或中央研究院，如果大家都要，便分作三份。我覺得將骨灰分開，不很妥當，想先問淸華和廈大，如果他們願意放棄，便由中央硏究院接受。我提起這些事，心中十分難過。我們應該追隨薩先生堅苦卓絕的精神來從事工作，這才是我們紀念薩先生最好的方法。」</p>
<h3>吳有訓揮淚報告生平事略</h3>
<p>繼由前中央大學校長吳有訓報吿薩氏生平事略，略謂：薩氏一九〇二年七月生於福建閩侯，一九二一年畢業於清華學校，卽派送美國，入史丹福大學習機械，於一九二四年得學士位，轉入麻省吳斯德工學院，翌年得電機工程師學位，轉習物理，又兩年，得物理學博士。一九二七年離校，應西屋電器公司之聘爲工程師。一九二八年回國，應淸華大學之聘爲物理系敎授，亘八年之久。一九三六年再度去美，應俄亥俄大學之聘爲訪問敎授，一年後返國，於抗日戰爭之前夕，應聘爲廈門大學校長，垂七年。一九四四年又去美，先後應麻省工大學及史丹福大學爲訪問敎授，一九四五年返國，任中央硏究院總幹事以迄於逝世之日。生平著作豐富，尤以物理敎科書馳名中外。吳氏與薩爲二十年老友，報吿時泣不成聲。最後並稱：「我們今天追悼他，對他的學問·道德·文章·是深深地永遠懷念的。」</p>
<p>繼由淸華大學校長梅貽琦致詞稱：「本棟在事業和學問都很有成就的時　死去，是一個很大的損失，非常可惜。但仔細一想，我們也不必太悲哀，每個人都有一次死，除病以外，還有許參原因可以使一個人無法繼續工作。本　的死於病，是因爲他對於工作太認眞。他年紀很小，在淸華念書的時候，我從他打綱球以及做童子軍兩件小事上，就看出他做事非常認眞，又非常公正，他是當得起英文裏面。“Integrity”這個字的，我們應該以他來做榜樣。」</p>
<h3>胡適致詞讚揚薩氏四項事業</h3>
<p>北大校長胡適致詞稱：「薩先生的事業有四方面，卽是淸華大學·廈門大學·中央硏究院，以及他的著作。他敎授法非常之好，在北大敎過一年物理，因爲敎得太好，以致他走後繼任的敎授不受學生歡迎了。他辦廈門大學，是抗戰期間國內最優秀的大學。他主持中央硏究院太負責任，以致躭誤了病症。他所著的敎科書又是非常的成功。他一生二十年事業，無形中影響了無數的人，所以我贊成梅校長的觀點，覺得薩先生雖然與世長逝，他的精神却是不朽的。」</p>
<p>繼又由前英士大學校長杜佐周致詞，對於廉氏生前主持廈門大學時之辦學精神深表欽佩。最後由家屬代表致答謝詞，奏哀樂禮成，此一代學術界完人之追悼會，乃於一片哀思中結束。</p>

<h3>雁茶談屑</h3>
<p>— 王了</p>
<p>雁蕩山位居樂淸東鄕，風景雄壯，岩石奇偉，如天柱峯拔地而起，　立雲霄，令人望而生畏，瀧湫澤布一瀉千仞，宛如白鍊，淸人江弢叔有「欲寫瀧湫難下筆，不淤雁宕是虛生」的名句，可說已把雁宕風景的幽美描寫得淋漓盡緻了，每年慕其名而來遊雁者，春秋兩季，何止千萬。</p>
<p>茶之得名！（二）</p>
<p>〔樂淸十四日訊〕雁蕩山的特產多不勝舉，除香魚乾及各種藥材外，雲霧茶也很聞名。雁蕩山之茶葉產於瀧愀背兜率峒諸地，與福建省之武夷山及本省之天台山等所產者，均以「雲霧茶」稱呼，茶樹生於溫帶，性喜潮濕，而於雲霧瀰漫，日光缺少的地方，它的生長分外良好，故凡高山深谷的茶葉，因雲霧之所賜，環境優良，品質特佳，雲霧茶的得名也就在此！</p>
<p>雁蕩山的雲霧茶，以兜率峒產者爲上品，瀧湫背產者次之，大瀧湫產者又次之，靈岩寺北斗峒一帶所產者爲下品。就自然環境言，雁茶產地當以兜率峒爲最高，岩峯疊障，　立天際，一日之中，日照時間甚短，僅上午十時至下午四時有陽光之照射，一年之中，自二月起至十一月間的霧李，則更雲霧繚繞，陰霾深沉，雖在夏天，非但沒有暑氣，猶極凉爽，惟冬季氣候較爲睛朗。瀧　背的自然環境亦佳，與兜率峒彷彿，不過地位稍低而已，大瀧湫位瀧漱背之麓，不免稍遜一籌，此外靈岩寺北斗峒諸地，位居平地，比之就前者大有軒輊了，再就茶葉之品質言，兜率峒茶因含有多量之茶素與單寗，沸水可冲之次，而最後一次汁味更覺淸香，（水份約百分三十一，茶素約百分之二，單寗約百分之十六，灰分約百分之五，可溶物質約佔百分之三十四），瀧湫背茶可冲二次，至於大瀧湫靈岩寺北斗峒一帶產者，不過是平常茶菓罷了。</p>
<p>治病奇茶</p>
<p>茶係用茶樹嫩葉製成，爲與奮作用，功能醫治身心之疲乏，兜率峒所產茶葉，醫治胸頭痛有獨到之奇效，筆者有鄰居，年已四十餘歲，患胸頭痛病，中西醫物罔效，痛苦異常，平時不能工作，一生事業斷送於此病，今年夏季，結識兜率峒道人，送他兜率峒產茶葉半斤，日飲三次，此久年積疾竟吿霍然痊愈，雖無科學道理，臨床試騐却極靈驗，使筆者益信兜率峒茶葉之可貴。</p>
<p>穀雨前後</p>
<p>雲霧茶採摘的季節，多在穀雨前後，這時茶葉之新芽芷開爲四葉，採摘尖芽及上部的三葉，而留其一葉，也有等新芽開成五葉時，採摘先端的三葉，採摘嫩葉可分三次，第一次芽品質優良，製作上等茶，收穫量不多，第三次芽收獲量達第一次芽之六倍，但其製成之茶葉品質甚劣，茶業於晴天採取後，卽分別其優劣，芟除粗稍雜物，加工製造，午後採得之茶，亦須於夜間製造完畢，倘若一時製造不及，便須設法貯藏，使勿凋萎與釀酵，鄉人因無大規模工塲，又不懂科學知識，製茶均墨守舊法，約須經過蒸調，搓揉，乾燥及精選等手續而後可，八斤之焙爐生葉，能製乾茶二斤，茶製成後，宣保持乾燥，不受潮涇，盛器以鍚物爲好，倘若保藏不法，氣味四溢，微生物侵入，則香氣薄弱，分文不値。若爲節省成本，茶葉放陽光下晒乾，卽下等品。</p>
<p>茶素單寗</p>
<p>茶葉的主要成分爲茶素，與單寗，茶素味苦，有毒，幸含量甚少，有醫治身心疲乏之效單，寗則有提神健胃之功，兩者化合而爲單寗酸，易溶於沸水，飲後使人心神爽快。茶素與單寗多含於嫩葉，上等茶都以嫩葉製成，因之香味佳良，茶葉依浸潰沸水中時間之增長，（微溫之湯茶，茶葉不易溶解，）而可溶分亦隨之增多，單寗的現象最爲顯著，據農業化學家的分析報吿，靈霧對於茶葉生長的影響很大，因爲當茶樹抽芽至採取的月餘時間內，所受日光少而險霾多，則茶葉中的茶素量增加，而單澀量减少，茶汁之苦寗味道隨之而减；反之日光充足，霧氣缺少的茶葉，其成分亦與前者南轅北轍，恰恰相反，雲霧茶的　貴就在這裏，雲霧茶得名的底蘊也在此地。</p>
<p>定購一空</p>
<p>市上出售之茶葉，頗多冒充，因爲兜率峒瀧湫背二地出產茶葉不多，茶季時卽被人定購一空，筆者於今春曾旅行雁蕩週餘，遍覓雲霧茶不可得，後來化了九牛二虎之力，爬到瀧愀背，在苦苦要求之下，始向茶戶購得少許，彌覺珍貴。茶葉品質之鑑審法，須視形狀，色澤，火度，水色，蒸熱度，香氣，味道，貯藏，培養等數點而判定，但有嗜茶癖的，能一飲便知物之優劣。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，因交通不使，雁蕩茶葉產量頓减，地人多予忽視。勝利後已漸見好轉，最近又有建設雁蕩爲國際公園的建議，名山之與盛，也是名產出頭的時候，故改良雁茶製法與廣植茶樹二點，實爲當務之急。</p>

<h3>Yan Huiqing and Others Return to the Capital; CCP Representative Candidates Largely Decided; Peace Talks May Begin in Beiping in Mid-March</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, and their party returned directly to the capital from Beiping, greatly strengthening the hope for peace. Although the representatives of various government factions avoided answering specific questions about the peace talks after returning to Nanjing, this reporter learned from reliable sources through unofficial channels that the CCP has agreed to hold peace talks with the government. The candidates for the CCP representatives are under consideration and have been largely decided. Once announced in the shortest possible time, peace negotiations will begin in Beiping in mid-March. This is the greatest achievement of the peace delegation's trip to Beiping and Shijiazhuang. The letter from Mao Zedong to Acting President Li is of particular importance, and it is generally believed that it will have a significant impact on the future of the peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The Shanghai Peace Delegation, consisting of Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Shao Lizi, traveled to Beiping in their private capacities to exchange views with CCP leaders on peace talk issues. After two weeks, they returned to Nanjing from Beiping on the Central Air Transport Corporation's special plane (537) at 2:15 PM on the 27th. The special plane landed at Ming Palace Airport, where government leaders in Nanjing went to the airport to welcome them. Acting President Li also sent his Chief of Staff, Li Yuqing, to greet them on his behalf. After the plane landed, Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shijian, Shao Lizi, and Jiang Yong disembarked in turn, shaking hands with each of the welcoming personnel. All four, Yan, Jiang, Zhang, and Shao, were wearing long gowns with overcoats. Their facial expressions were all very happy. When shaking hands with the welcoming personnel, they repeatedly praised the weather today. When Elder Yan shook hands with Yu Youren, he said, "The weather is really good today. The wind is strong and with us, so we flew here in just over three hours." Elder Shao, with a smiling face, shook hands with the welcoming personnel even more frequently. He then issued a written statement, which was read by Shao Lao's secretary, Zhang Fengzhou, in the airport lounge (see separate article). The representatives were photographed by a reporter named Hua Baoguo at the airport, and after exchanging pleasantries with the welcoming personnel, they took cars prepared by the Presidential Palace to the Capital Hotel for rest and lunch. Those who went to the airport to welcome them on the 27th included Acting President Li's representative, Li Yuqing, as well as Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Tong Guanxian, Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, Bai Chongxi, Xu Yongchang, He Yaozu, Li Dachao, Gui Yongqing, Zhang Yaoming, Zhang Zhen, Li Chongshi, Yuan Yongcheng, Qiu Changwei, Huang Yuren, Cui Shuqin, and dozens of others.

Zhang Zhizhong arrived late for the banquet due to business, while Gu Zhutong was unable to arrive in time due to business. The banquet table was in the shape of a horseshoe, with Acting President Li in the central seat, Yan Huiqing and Zhang Shizhao on his right, and Jiang Yong and Shao Lizi on his left. Yu Youren sat opposite them, with Ju Zheng, Wu Tiecheng, Tong Guanxian, and He Yaozu on either side. During the banquet, Acting President Li stood up to speak, saying that the four gentlemen, Yan, Jiang, Zhang, and Shao, had traveled for national affairs at the advanced age of seventy, which was extremely hard work. He expressed his gratitude on behalf of the government and the people. After speaking, he raised his glass in a toast. Then, the four, Yan, Jiang, Zhang, and Shao, stood up one after another to briefly report on their negotiations in Beiping and Shijiazhuang. Shao also gave a brief account of the general situation in Beiping. Afterwards, the attendees chatted individually, and the hosts and guests enjoyed themselves until the banquet ended at 9:10 PM.</p>
<h3>Yan, Jiang, Zhang, and Shao Issue a Written Statement: The Future of Peace Talks Faces Many Difficulties, But Hopes Are High</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The Shanghai Peace Delegation, consisting of Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shijian, and Shao Lizi, issued the following written statement after returning to Nanjing on the 27th: "We visited Beiping in the capacity of peacemakers for two weeks and held joint or separate talks with CCP leaders Ye Jianying, Lin Biao, Dong Biwu, Nie Rongzhen, Luo Rongxiang, and Bo Yibo. We were also invited to Shijiazhuang and received by CCP Chairman Mao Zedong and General Zhou Enlai, with whom we exchanged views extensively on the issue of peace. We deeply feel that although there are still many difficulties in the future of the peace talks, hopes are high. The mission of this trip can be said to be over, so we are returning south and intend to report to Acting President Li before returning to Shanghai. In Beiping and Shijiazhuang, agreement was reached in principle on the issues of facilitating air and postal communications between the North and the South. We are also grateful for the sincere hospitality of the CCP leaders. Yan Huiqing (signed), Jiang Yong (signed), Zhang Shichuan (signed), Shao Lizi (signed)."</p>
<h3>The Delegation Meets Mao Zedong Twice in Shijiazhuang;</h3>
<p>Beiping Doesn't Know the Economic Plan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] After returning to Nanjing, Shao Lizi met with reporters in the restaurant of the Capital Hotel at 3:00 PM to chat about the situation in the old capital. He first stated that he would not answer any questions about the peace issue outside the scope of the written statement. The reporter then asked the peace elder, who had traveled tirelessly on the road from Beiping to Nanjing, the following questions:</p>
<p>Q: Mr. Shao, how many times did you and Mr. Mao Zedong talk in Shijiazhuang?</p>
<p>A: We talked twice, and the time was quite long.</p>
<p>Q: Was your freedom of movement protected in Beiping?</p>
<p>A: Meeting guests and being guests were both very free.</p>
<p>Q: Can you tell us more about the air and postal communications?</p>
<p>A: Air communications (including ships and airplanes) have been largely resolved and can carry passengers, but the specific methods still need to be studied by experts. Mail can be loaded on the next ship.</p>
<p>Q: How was life in Beiping?</p>
<p>A: Several old gentlemen are in good health and spirits. The CCP's hospitality was especially warm. This time, we encountered favorable winds on our return trip, and we all have a good impression of Beiping.</p>
<p>Q: Is General Fu Zuoyi in good health?</p>
<p>A: Yes. At this time, the waiter had prepared Western food and waited for Elder Shao to eat. Shao suddenly had a thought, turned around and said to the reporter, "There is news I can tell you. I have already met with a group of friends in Panyang, including Shen Junru and Guo Moruo, more than forty people." After speaking, he went to the newspaper rack to get a newspaper and saw the news of the announcement of the new economic plan. Shao said, "We didn't know about these things in Beiping."</p>

<h3>The Legislative Yuan Resumes Session in Nanjing Today; Holds the First Meeting of the Third Session; Legislators Staying in Guangzhou Request Postponement of Resumption</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian hosted a tea party for legislators in Nanjing at 3:00 PM on the 27th on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall, with more than 100 people attending.

Subsequently, the members freely exchanged opinions on the issue of resumption until the meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th Dispatch] Forty-two legislators staying in Guangzhou held a symposium at 5:30 PM on the 27th. After a heated discussion on the issue of resumption, it was decided to send another telegram to President Tong Guanxian, requesting that the resumption on the 28th be cancelled immediately and that the resumption date be postponed slightly in order to solicit opinions from legislators from various places and decide on the resumption location through joint consultation or with the consent of more than half of all members. At the same time, telegrams were sent to legislators from various places, urging them to come to Guangzhou to discuss everything together. Legislator Zheng Yanfen strongly stated at the symposium that "if the Legislative Yuan does not resume session before February 28, it will be violating the Constitution."</p>

The main issues for this resumption of the Legislative Yuan are the reorganization of the new cabinet and the peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If the statutory number of attendees for the resumption is exceeded, it will not affect the resumption, so they do not intend to attend this session.</p>
<h3>Financial and Monetary Reform Plan; Implementation Rules to Be Announced Soon; Liu Gongyun Returns to Shanghai from Guangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Governor Liu Gongyun of the Central Bank of China arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday on a China National Aviation Corporation flight from Guangzhou. Finance Minister Xu Kan stayed in Guangdong and did not leave. According to Xu's aides, he may fly to Nanjing with President Sun within a few days. President Liu brought with him the implementation rules of the financial and monetary reform plan, which will be discussed with representatives of the financial and industrial and commercial sectors here today and then announced for implementation. According to insiders, the Central Bank's current strength can at least maintain price stability for three months. As for the rumors that silver dollars may be listed, senior officials of the bank expressed doubts, believing that this would repeat the mistakes of listing gold for redemption and create a black market for silver dollar prices. Each time the official price changes, the black market will also change, becoming an indicator of speculation. Therefore, it is expected that the Central Bank will not take this measure again.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on the Peace Delegates' Arrival in Nanjing: The Four Elders All Gained Weight, Bringing Back Many Private Letters; Mao Zedong Used Playing Cards as a Metaphor, Expressing Willingness for Peace</h3>
<p>— …Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th…</p>
<p>After the peace delegation took off from Shanghai on the 13th, it arrived in Qingdao on the same day. Due to a burst airplane tire, they were delayed in Qingdao for one day. Only after they arrived in Beiping the next day did they learn that Ye Jianying and Xu Bing had been waiting for them at the airport on the afternoon of the 13th, but returned to the city at 7 PM. The reason for their absence was unknown, and Ye and others expressed great anxiety. On the 14th, the delegation arrived at Beiping's Xiyuan Airport by plane, where they were welcomed by Representative Xu Bing. That evening, they attended a banquet at Ye Jianying's invitation. On the morning of the 27th, before the delegation departed from Beiping, Shao Lizi once again exchanged opinions on peace issues with Li Jishen, Zhang Bojun, and Shen Junru. They boarded the plane at 11:15 AM. When they departed, Ye Jianying, Xu Bing, and others went to the airport to see them off.</p>
<p>When the peace plane landed at the capital airport at 2:20 PM on the 27th, the fuselage swayed slightly, apparently due to insufficient air in the tires, as there was no large inflation equipment available at the time in Beiping.</p>
<p>As the door of the plane opened, Shao Lao was inside the cabin. Before his face was seen, his laughter was heard. Welcoming personnel said, "Shao Lao is laughing, so the peace talks must be optimistic."</p>
<p>When the peace delegation departed from Beiping, Ye Jianying and others presented them with many items of fruit, pastries, and cigarettes. Deng Baoshan and others also presented each member with generous gifts, including jars of Beiping pickles, Laojiao wine from Shijiazhuang, and Yantai apples—everything one could wish for.</p>
<p>The "Liberation Tobacco" brought back by the delegation included brands such as Elephant and Sea Swallow, produced by the New China Tobacco Company. The packaging of the twenty-cigarette packs was quite poor, with the words "Registered Trademark of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Government Industry and Commerce Bureau" printed on them.</p>
<p>Attendants of the delegation offered "Liberation Cigarettes" to guests at the Capital Hotel. The taste was mild, but they were quite difficult to smoke.</p>
<p>The delegation members brought back many private letters, evoking a sense of "a letter from home is worth a thousand pieces of gold after three thousand miles of war."</p>
<p>On the 26th, the delegation members had lunch at the China Restaurant of the Six Nations Hotel with representatives from the Communist side and our personnel stationed in Beiping. The group photograph included Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, Shao Lizi, Dong Biwu (Communist side), Deng Baoshan, Ye Jianying (Communist side), Lin Biao (Communist side), Fu Zuoyi, Bo Yibo (Communist side), Xu Bing (Communist side), Nie Rongzhen (Communist side), Guo Zongfen, Chuan Daocang, Gu Lecun, Jin Anqing, Tao Zhu (Communist side), Zhang Fengzhou, Jiao Xiangzong, the co-pilot Lu, Pan Boying, Jin Shan, Jiao [blank], Zhou Beifeng, Huang Qihan, Rong Zihe (Communist side), Liu Zhonghua (two people), Chen Weiwen (pilot), and Dian Zhongren—29 people in total.</p>
<p>Judging from the photograph, the British coat of arms was still in place in the Six Nations Hotel. The hands of the clock pointed to 2:10, and it was said that the clock had stopped running long ago.</p>
<p>General Fu Zuoyi wore a cotton military uniform without shoulder marks or collar insignia, and shallow Chinese shoes. He appeared slightly thinner.</p>
<p>During the two weeks in Beiping, the only time the Kuomintang flag was seen was on Deng Baoshan's hat badge.</p>
<p>There were many cars in Beiping. Vehicles were constantly prepared in front of the Six Nations Hotel to solve the transportation problems of the delegation members. When the vehicles came and went, the drivers always asked, "Are you waiting for a while? What time should I come to pick you up?" Their attitude was friendly.</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing's private doctor, Jiao Xiangzong, became the joint medical consultant for the four elders. However, no one sought his medical attention during the two weeks. They did not feel any discomfort when boarding or disembarking.</p>
<p>The four elders all gained weight compared to before they went to Beiping, indicating that the nutrition there was very good.</p>
<p>The Communist side's hospitality in Beiping was extensive. Chinese and Western food was available. Shao Lao found it difficult to get used to and asked for vegetarian dishes, after which his meals gradually increased.</p>
<p>A glimpse of the gold market: ten US dollars exchanged for fifteen silver dollars. One silver dollar exchanged for 300 gold yuan, and one silver dollar exchanged for ten people's yuan.</p>
<p>On the eve of their departure from Beiping, Cheng Yanqiu was performing *Suo Lin Nang*. Although the delegation members wanted to hear the famous play, they had to forgo the pleasure because they were busy preparing for the trip.</p>
<p>The families of Jiang Yong and Zhang Shizhao were all in Beiping. When they arrived in Beiping, they went home to see their families and found that nothing was missing, which made them very happy.</p>
<p>Some dance halls in Beiping have reopened, staying open all night. People only leave when their enthusiasm wanes. However, there are no professional dance hostesses. Temporary partners need to be found on the black market.</p>
<p>The city's telephone lines have been restored, and soldiers buy tickets for transportation and theater.</p>
<p>It is said that when Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Shao Lizi met with Mao Zedong in Shijiazhuang, Mao's first words expressing his willingness for peace were using playing cards as a metaphor. He said, "We've been playing cards for so long, it's time to stop."</p>
<p>The four representatives agreed not to reveal the specific content of their talks in Beiping and Shijiazhuang. Except for Shao Lizi, who met with reporters, the other three did not meet with reporters. Shao Lizi advised the reporters, "For the sake of peace, you should sacrifice some reporting. The less you publish, the better."</p>
<p>The written statement of the four representatives was drafted by Zhang Fengzhou's secretary. Regarding the future of the peace talks, two sentences were initially written as "We deeply feel that although there are many difficulties in the future of the peace talks, there is great hope." After deliberation by the four peace elders, it was changed to "We deeply feel that although there are still many difficulties in the future of the peace talks, there is great hope," reflecting their cautiousness.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong Sends a Letter to Acting President Li, Presenting His Views on Current Issues</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] It is reported that CCP Chairman Mao Zedong has sent a letter to Acting President Li, presenting his views on current issues. The letter has been brought to Nanjing by Yan Huiqing and others for submission.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Psychological Foundation of Peace Talks</h3>
<p>The four peace elders, Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong, flew back to Nanjing from Beiping yesterday afternoon and issued a written statement, the gist of which was that they "deeply feel that although there are still many difficulties in the future of the peace talks, there is great hope." With this result, the four elders' half-month trip can be considered worthwhile. Their "door-knocking work" for national peace is not only gratifying to Acting President Li, but also appreciated by the citizens of Nanjing and Shanghai and the people of the whole country for their tireless efforts.</p>
<p>During these two weeks, in addition to giving an important broadcast to rectify official conduct and military discipline, Acting President Li also made a southern tour, visiting the provincial capitals of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, making known to officials and civilians in various places his greatest sincerity and boundless confidence in striving for overall peace. He had several very moving words, namely: "Today, all comrades of the Kuomintang must thoroughly examine the factors of failure. Failure is the mother of success, and we must not lose heart. We hope to unite to seek true peace... We are definitely not doing it for the positions of a few people, but for the purpose of achieving true peace for our four hundred million compatriots." Now, Acting President Li has returned to Nanjing, and Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan is also expected to fly to Nanjing today. Other high officials from various places have also been invited to Beijing one after another. In the coming days, there will be very important consultations in the capital. Of course, the issue of how to proceed with the peace talks should be the top priority for the authorities to consult on.</p>
<p>Standing from the people's perspective, we yearn for peace and will naturally exceed any authority on both sides. Hearing the words of the peace elders, "Many difficulties, great hope," we cannot help but sincerely implore both sides to quickly work hard to overcome the various difficulties before the realization of peace talks. The most important work to overcome difficulties is to jointly build the psychological foundation of peace talks.</p>
<p>In all matters under heaven, whether big or small, the motivation stems from people's initial thought. This thought is the psychological tendency of one person or even a group of people. What the heart desires is called ambition, and those with ambition will succeed. Therefore, warfare has the will to fight, and seeking peace must have the will to seek peace. We believe that Acting President Li, after President Chiang Kai-shek resolutely stepped down to seek peace, endured humiliation and continued to seek the realization of peace, truly has the will to seek peace. On the Communist side, Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the CCP, and other gentlemen also extensively exchanged views on peace issues with the four peace elders, which shows that they also have the will to seek peace. Since both sides have the will to seek peace, then no matter how many difficulties may be encountered in the tortuous process, we always hope that the authorities on both sides must stand on a solid psychological foundation to overcome them. Then, what materials should the authorities on both sides use to build the psychological foundation for peace talks? We believe that the four great words of 公 (fairness), 容 (tolerance), 忍 (forbearance), and 悲 (compassion) are the psychological foundation of peace talks.</p>
<p>First, there must be "fairness." The Three Principles of the People advocated by the Kuomintang are for the purpose of saving the country and the people; the New Democracy currently advocated by the Communist Party is for the purpose of "liberating" the people. If both are truly for the people, it is best to have no self-interest. Being for the people is fairness, and being for oneself is selfishness. Only by being "fair" can one "share" (共); only then can there be "harmony" (和). How can there be "sharing" and "harmony" without fairness? As long as there is true fairness, no one will be willing to oppose. As long as one is truly and fairly for the people, without discrimination against all good people, one can gain the understanding of the other side and the love of the people. As long as one can truly do what Acting President Li said, "not for the positions of a few people but for four hundred million compatriots," under such a selfless attitude, there will naturally be no party grievances. If so, the government should of course thoroughly implement its seven measures, and the CCP does not have to arrest war criminals and suppress newspapers in its jurisdiction. Therefore, starting from the point of "fairness," the conditions proposed by both sides can of course be placed on the great scale of "Is it for the people?" to weigh, and it is believed that all doubts can be dispelled, and a ceasefire and peace talks can be achieved immediately. How beneficial this would be to the people in dire straits!</p>
<p>Second, there must be "tolerance." Since one wants to seek peace, one must of course know oneself and the other, benefit oneself and others, and especially benefit all people. Only in this way, in the process of seeking peace, must the authorities on both sides broaden their minds, accept the other side's reasonable opinions, and even accept the people's reasonable demands. What Acting President Li said in Hankou, hoping that the Kuomintang would lean a little to the left and the Communist Party would lean a little to the right, is probably close to the spirit of mutual accommodation. As the Confucianists said, "All things grow together without harming each other," "Tacit agreement is enough to achieve harmony," and "Respect the mother, do not only think of oneself," etc., are all teaching people not to harbor the idea of ​​being the only one who is right, and not to cling to one's own prejudices and obliterate everything. As for Buddhism, it even advocates great tolerance, the so-called "Each hair pore can accommodate all worlds without obstruction," which is a metaphor for boundless capacity. We only hope that the authorities on both sides will always think highly of the four hundred million people, and for the sake of the people, first have the great capacity to accept all dissenting opinions, and then calmly discuss them to reconcile all dissenting opinions, so as to obtain the ideal state of holding to the middle path. Only then can true peace be achieved.</p>
<p>Third, there must be "forbearance." "A small lack of forbearance will ruin great plans" is an ancient saying that everyone knows, and the Chinese people have cultivated the virtue of forbearance for thousands of years. General Zhang Zhizhong, the peace advocate, may have the family heirloom of the "Hall of a Hundred Forbearances" and the ancient legacy of suffering humiliation on the bridge. Today, if the authorities on both sides truly have a compassionate heart and implement compassionate policies, then what else is there to say except for everyone to lay down their weapons, hug each other and cry, and repent before the common people? Moreover, in the two parties with twenty years of fighting history, if both sides want to lay down their butcher knives one day, they will of course not be able to stand "mutual abuse leads to no good," and they need to have the great virtue of "enduring humiliation" and accept it calmly without being surprised. Only then can one expect that the propaganda war in the style of罵街 (marching in the streets and loudly shouting to provoke others) can dissipate one day. Since before and after President Chiang Kai-shek's resignation, all these years, until now, he has endured all kinds of abuse, and today he lives a secluded life in the mountains and forests, without officialdom and feeling light, and he never utters a single word of defense against the abuse, which is deeply in line with the key to forbearance. Acting President Li, despite being denigrated as a puppet of American conspiracy, has always been committed to seeking peace, and he is also very good at achieving the samadhi of forbearance. Originally, people have blood and energy, and emotions are impulsive, so forbearance is the most difficult. Therefore, the Buddhist scriptures say, "Those who can practice forbearance can be called powerful adults." It must be known that the greatest obstacle to peace is the emotions of hatred and anger on both sides. If we do not try our best to subdue these emotions, peace will be difficult to achieve. As for the method of treating anger, the Dharma points out the word 定 (settled), and to be settled, one must first be able to forbear. The Diamond Sutra says, "Knowing that all dharmas are without self, one can attain forbearance." The Avatamsaka Sutra says: "Penetrating this door of forbearance, one will achieve unquestionable wisdom." Therefore, if both sides truly want to seek peace, and if they can each restrain themselves and achieve this word of forbearance, then they will surely generate great wisdom "for the country and for the people", and thus transform the success of peace.</p>
<p>Fourth, there must be "compassion." We want to urge the authorities on both sides to look at the pitiful people, to issue great compassion, to take all disputes to the meeting place, and not to use guns and cannons to fight on the battlefield again! The Avatamsaka Sutra says: "... all sentient beings are the roots of trees, and all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are the flowers and fruits; by irrigating sentient beings with the water of great compassion, one can achieve the flowers and fruits of the wisdom of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas... If there are no sentient beings, all Bodhisattvas will ultimately not be able to achieve unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment." This passage can be used to illustrate the relationship between the people and the government authorities. If there are no people, then the government cannot become a government! And the government authorities should issue great compassion to the people, as the Avatamsaka Sutra says, "In all illnesses, be a good physician; for those who have lost their way, show them the right path; in the darkness of night, be a light; for the poor, enable them to find hidden treasures. Bodhisattvas thus equally benefit all sentient beings," then the people will love them and cherish them as parents, and will never resent them and hate them as enemies, or fear them and avoid them as snakes and scorpions. We only hope that the authorities on both sides, especially the Communist authorities, will always think of the deep suffering and trauma suffered by the people from years of war. How can they bear to subject them to the baptism of artillery fire again? Those who "liberate" the people should have the original intention of alleviating the suffering of the people; those who "defend" the people should have the original intention of striving for the survival of the people. These all stem from a thought of compassion for heaven and pity for humanity. If both sides truly issue this great compassion of the Bodhi mind, always thinking of the people and always saving the people, then it will be as the peace elders envisioned, "Although there are many difficulties, there is great hope."</p>
<h3>Cheng Qian's Conversation with a British Newspaper Reporter: Consistent Opinions on Topics Discussed When Acting President Li Passed Through Hunan; It Is Difficult to Judge Whether the CCP Is Sincere About Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch of the 27th] Trufan, a reporter for the London Observer, arrived in Changsha from Guangzhou. On the 27th, he interviewed Chairman Cheng and raised many questions, to which Cheng answered one by one.</p>
<p>Question: Can you reveal the content of the talks between Acting President Li and the Chairman when he visited Hunan? Were your opinions consistent?</p>
<p>Answer: Acting President Li and I mainly discussed issues related to peace and the need to strengthen the government's own reforms. Our opinions were completely the same. However, there is a lot of content that is not yet the time to disclose, so I am unable to tell you.</p>
<p>Question: Is the CCP sincere about peace talks?</p>
<p>Answer: It is difficult to judge the CCP's sincerity about peace talks at this time. I believe that the CCP may be sincere, but its sincerity is different from ours. That is to say, if the CCP wants everything to meet its requirements, otherwise it may be difficult to be sincere.</p>
<p>Question: If the CCP is not sincere about peace, will the provinces in South China, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, etc., form another government to confront the CCP government in North China?</p>
<p>Answer: This situation is unlikely to happen before. Even if peace fails, the people of the South still hope for peace. Acting President Li will absolutely comply with the people's urgent desire for peace. As long as it is conducive to promoting peace, the government is still willing to make concessions. If the CCP's purpose is something else, and peace cannot succeed, then Acting President Li may make other arrangements on behalf of the people of the South, but it is not yet possible to say for sure.</p>
<p>Question: What is the current situation of the land reform movement in Hunan? What are your future ambitions for this?</p>
<p>Answer: Rent reduction has been implemented in this province. However, due to some shortcomings in technology, it has not been as ideal as expected. I am determined to complete it thoroughly within this year. As for land limitation, it is currently being carefully planned. However, I adopt a moderate approach to land reform, similar to the method of British Fabian socialism, and absolutely not through means such as liquidation, struggle, and slaughter.</p>
<p>Question: It is rumored that President Chiang Kai-shek may resume his post in Guangzhou and continue to lead the government. What are the Chairman's thoughts on this?</p>
<p>Answer: I have no opinion on this issue. However, based on my personal view of general public opinion, this rumor may be the unanimous hope of people who want President Chiang Kai-shek to resume his post. However, progressive elements within the Kuomintang and the people of the whole country unanimously need peace. If President Chiang Kai-shek resumes his post, it is tantamount to symbolizing the despair of peace and continuing the final struggle with the CCP. This will be resolutely opposed by the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Question: What is the working relationship between the Chairman and Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan?</p>
<p>Answer: Since the formation of the Sun Cabinet, the Hunan Provincial Government has rarely received his official documents or instructions, but the official documents submitted by the Provincial Government to the Executive Yuan are very numerous, but no reply has been received so far.</p>
<p>Trufan came to China from England for only two months. After finishing his work in Changsha, he is scheduled to travel to Nanchang via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway on the morning of the 28th and then return to Shanghai via Hangzhou.</p>

<h3>The United States Asks the Soviet Union for Assistance to the Shenyang Consulate; the Soviet Foreign Ministry Says It Is Powerless to Help</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 27th] Since the CCP army occupied Shenyang on November 18 of last year, the U.S. Consul General in Shenyang, Walter, and ten staff members have been cut off from communication with the State Department in Washington. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has repeatedly requested assistance from the Soviet Foreign Ministry, but the Soviet Foreign Ministry has replied that it is powerless to help. According to a report from the Soviet Ministry of Communications, there are no telephone or telegraph connections between the Soviet Union and Shenyang. Although the letters requested by the U.S. Embassy to be forwarded have been received, no reply from Walter has been received so far, so it is impossible to know whether they were delayed. The U.S. Embassy is continuing to inquire.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army in Beiping Receives Flour, Arguing That It Has Nothing to Do with Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the CCP broadcast on the 27th, "On the 18th of this month, the Beiping Military Control Commission received 6,666 bags of flour stored in the Beiping Office of the National Government Executive Yuan United Aid Use Committee.

However, according to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, the batch of flour belongs to the US Aid Association and was personally handed over by the director of the Beiping Office of the Association. This is the People's Liberation Army receiving the materials of the Kuomintang government and has nothing to do with the China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration."</p>

The design is the same as the civilian Third Year Yuan Datou. The weight is 7 mace and 2 candareens according to the treasury scale, and the silver content is 88.10%. However, because a large embossing machine cannot be found, after the official start of production, small manual machines will be used for minting, and the output will be limited. It is also known that if the three provinces of Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang request to prepare on their behalf, Gansu Province can also accept, but a considerable handling fee will be charged.</p>
<h3>Public School Employees in Wuhan Send a Telegram, Requesting to Be Paid in Silver Dollars; Military and Political Personnel in the Northwest Will Be Paid in Silver Dollars Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 27th] The Liaison Association of Central Agencies stationed in Hankou was expanded today to become the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan District Public School Employees Liaison Association, and passed a telegram unanimously appealing to the central government from public school employees across the country, requesting that the treatment of civil servants be changed to the same method as military personnel's salaries, all calculated in silver dollars. The original telegram reads as follows: "To the public school employees of agencies at all levels in all provinces and cities: I recently sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, which read: 'I have checked that the suffering of our public school employees has been felt deeply since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. The pain has been deepened in the three years of war, especially with the recent increasing fluctuations in prices, which has put us in a desperate situation that we cannot maintain. Although the treatment has been adjusted many times, it is very different from the actual situation. The small amount is of no help. I respectfully present several urgent requests, asking for your approval to relieve the poverty: (1) Civil servants' treatment is poor, please follow the salary method of military personnel, all calculated in silver dollars. (2) Please allocate supplies in kind according to the allocation method of the Beijing-Shanghai area to show fairness.

<h3>Recent Situation in the Jianghuai and Southern Shandong Regions: People's Lives Have Not Changed Drastically</h3>
<p>Very Little Construction, Wounds of War Not Healed</p>
<p>[Huaming Agency, Shanghai] It has been confirmed by recent arrivals that the living conditions of the people in the Jianghuai region and the border area of southern Shandong, which were occupied by the Communist army some time ago, have not changed drastically. According to their descriptions of the recent situation in the area: due to the relatively warm weather last winter, there was no flooding near Xuzhou. Currently, there is no shortage of rain, and wild vegetables are growing, so for the next few months, people can barely fill their stomachs. However, there is a lack of seeds for planting, so the phenomenon of near-famine has become widespread. Due to limited funds, there is very little construction, so the old traces of war still remain, and most public buildings have not been repaired and are badly damaged. Of the five bridge openings of the Huaihe Railway Bridge in Bengbu, it is heard that they were deliberately destroyed by the retreating Nationalist army. It is said that only a small number of the administrative personnel dispatched by the Communist Party in the area have received a complete education or are experienced. Many young people have been compiled and sent to several "training schools" of the Communist Party to accelerate their learning of courses related to administrative or propaganda work. In one city newly occupied by the Communist army, as many as 400 teachers are presiding over this one-month crash course for the masses. Although ordinary schools have all reopened, whether private or not, they are all staging propaganda plays and participating in mass rallies of the Communist Party. In these rallies, people are often instilled with the idea of living a hard and combative life, and all propaganda is based on anti-American materials. In general, larger cities are able to print and distribute Communist literary and art publications, of which the "Jianghuai Daily" is one. The newspaper uses pinyin letters (i.e., the so-called "Latinization of the Australian Character"); the Communist Party believes that this is a new and valuable direction for the Chinese journalism community. The Communist army units in urban areas have relatively good discipline, while those stationed in rural towns often use civilian goods and do not pay for them. The paper money circulating in the area controlled by the Communist army is very chaotic. Normal postal services have not yet been established in the area.</p>

<h3>Government to Relax Restrictions on Chinese Merchants Doing Business in Japan Can Engage in Semi-Permanent Trade</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] It is reported that our government may soon allow merchants coming to Japan to engage in commercial activities in Japan on a semi-permanent basis. Our delegation in Japan has suggested to the government that merchants be given the same status as overseas Chinese merchants. Our government previously ordered merchants coming to Japan to return home within two months, but most merchants are unwilling to return immediately because they have laid a business foundation and established institutions to engage in Sino-Japanese trade during their stay in Japan. People from the trade group of the delegation said that the Allied Headquarters had already permitted foreign merchants to engage in trade in Japan on a semi-permanent basis several months ago. However, the government's regulations restricting the period of stay for merchants have not changed. Currently, there are 15 Chinese merchants in Japan who, in the six months since arriving in Japan, have exported goods worth US$2.5 million to our country.</p>

<h3>Fierce Artillery Battles Between Army and Navy, Coup d'État Suddenly Occurs in Siam, All External Transportation in Bangkok Interrupted, Siam Report Points Out that Insurgents Received Economic Aid from a Certain Country</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: Bangkok Report: Near the residence of Siamese Prime Minister Songgram, troops from the armored division controlled by the army suddenly engaged in fierce fighting with artillery controlled by the navy today, which only subsided at noon. At the time, the army's radio station broadcast that the troops under Marshal Songgram had pardoned "the rebellion of reactionary elements," while the navy radio station said that the army intended to "obstruct the navy from carrying out its duties, and a tragic war has occurred." The police have now occupied the post office, and all external radio communications and air transportation in Bangkok have been suspended. It is reported that the Siamese authorities announced martial law starting last Thursday. The next day, Songgram declared that the authorities had discovered a coup d'état plot to subvert the government and had taken action to pardon them all. The authorities also announced that they had arrested 24 suspects on Thursday and Friday, including three Siamese military officers and one Chinese. It was said that the suspect was a Communist. The Siam Report also said that these conspirators had received economic assistance from a certain foreign country. However, 48 hours after this announcement, someone suddenly broke into the radio station and broadcast that former Siamese Ambassador to England, Jie Yana, had succeeded Songgram as Prime Minister. 接氏係 is an important member of the "Free Thailand Movement." But the broadcast suddenly stopped, and when the broadcast resumed, it was said that Songgram was still the Prime Minister, and the previous broadcast was done by illegal elements. After the artillery battles occurred today, people were extremely uneasy.</p>

<h3>Burmese Rebels Attack Mandalay, Fighting is Underway in the Southern Suburbs, Military Aid to Burma Conference Opens Today in New Delhi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yangon, 26th] A report has been received here confirming that government troops have recaptured Miyo, the army training center 40 miles north of Mandalay. Officials in Yangon can breathe a little easier, but the war is still going on in the suburbs. The Karen army, which is active in the Meitila area, attacked Mandalay from the south yesterday and entered an area 10 miles from the city but was eventually repelled by government forces. Fierce fighting continues in the southern suburbs of Mandalay. Observers believe that the Karen people will not let go of Mandalay, as it is the second largest city in Burma. In the Insein area, 10 miles outside Yangon, the fighting between the Karen army and the government army has lasted for 27 days. Although the Karen army is surrounded on all sides, they show no signs of surrendering. It is believed that it will take some time to clear the Karen army from the area.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 26th] A Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that India intends to provide loans to Burma to help it overcome the difficulties of the civil war but does not intend to provide military assistance. India and other dominions of the British Commonwealth will meet on the 28th to discuss aid to Burma.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] The British Economist Weekly commented on the Burmese situation, saying that the Karen rebellion has further increased the complex situation in Burma, hindering the country from achieving political and economic stability. The hostility between the Burmese and the two million Karen people has a long history. It is still difficult to predict the outcome of the current war. The Burmese government has so far attempted to defend the capital and is receiving military supplies from the United Kingdom in order to maintain its authority. The Burmese government can only quell the rebellion of the Communist People's Volunteer Army if it reaches a compromise with the Karen people. Currently, the Communist Party and the Karen people seem to be fighting side by side. Various parties in Burma may unite to fight against the government, but if the Communist Party can take advantage of the conflict between the two ethnic groups and reap the benefits, the result will be extremely unfortunate for Burma.</p>

<h3>Western Europe Jointly Defends Against Aggression Maintains Military Strength of 3 Million Eisenhower Expected to Be Supreme Planner</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th] It has been learned that after the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, a US military general, possibly General Eisenhower, will assume the highest military position in planning the defense of the Atlantic and Western Europe. Western Europe hopes for this development, and most Western nations are willing to do so. At the same time, many US officials believe that after the US signs the treaty and begins to transport arms to Western Europe, this will be the only logical solution. Eisenhower is the most popular figure to be called to serve as commander-in-chief or chairman. His recall to Washington to temporarily serve as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff while discussing arms aid to Western European countries has further fueled this speculation. The North Atlantic Treaty will unite Western nations to maintain a military strength of more than 3 million people in peacetime and adopt joint defense to be able to cope with any sudden attack from the East. The five Western European countries have already established a joint military committee to formulate preliminary plans for joint defense. Their total military strength reaches 1,567,000 people, and it is also said that they are planning to establish a joint mechanized force of 50 divisions, approximately 500,000 people. After the signing of the treaty, the United States and Canada will participate in the Western European group with military strengths of 1,665,300 and 39,000 people respectively, in the largest peacetime alliance in history.</p>
<p>British Field Marshal Montgomery, the current chairman of the military committee planning the defense of the Western European Union, has his headquarters in Fontainebleau, France. But it has now been decided that after the Western European Union is expanded into the Atlantic Treaty, a US general will serve as the highest military officer, and Montgomery will undoubtedly retire.</p>
<p>Western European and US military experts have pointed out the reasons why a US general will be the logical choice for the highest military officer in the Atlantic Treaty as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The United States will supply arms for Western European defense; (2) The United States will maintain control over any affairs in the Air Force Strategic Command; (3) Only a US general can avoid seeking more arms for his own country.</p>
<p>It is understood that the general outline of the highly secret Western European Union defense plan formulated in Fontainebleau is: a defense line from the coast of the Netherlands to the border of Switzerland, under unified command. Mechanized troops will be supplied by the five countries for defense. According to unofficial reports, France will contribute 35 mechanized divisions and 5 armored divisions to the armored force, while Belgium and the Netherlands will each allocate 3 divisions, plus some small forces, each including approximately 12 combat cavalry squadrons.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Attempts to Undermine Atlantic Alliance</h3>
<p>Pressuring Small Countries to Prevent Them from Participating</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] Communist Eastern Europe is pressuring small countries not to participate in this convention and to leave the sphere of influence of the signatory countries. Poland summoned its ambassadors to Denmark, Norway, and Sweden this week to discuss the Atlantic Treaty. Its main purpose is obviously to prevent non-Communist countries from considering participating in this convention.

He said that it is generally agreed that "Japan's economic reconstruction is the primary goal of the United States government. As far as I know, no one seems to have taken the opposite view. This reconstruction benefits Japan, American taxpayers, and the world. The best evidence that the United States is eager to help Japan recover is that the United States spends $2.5 billion annually on relief and reconstruction." He said that in the past year, Germany's reconstruction has contributed significantly to the success of the European Recovery Program and the Economic Cooperation Administration. He also pointed out that the Berlin airlift has "proven our determination to remain in Berlin and persevere to the end."</p>
<h3>Although the Situation in Europe is Extremely Tense, International War Can Be Avoided for the Time Being: A General Review of East-West Relations in 1948</h3>
<p>— Sabengeng</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>This is not intended to describe the internal situation of various countries in continental Europe over the past year, but to review the international situation in continental Europe over the past year.</p>
<p>The situation in continental Europe in 1948 can almost be said to have been a year of "Cold War". The confrontation between the East and West blocs became increasingly acute. At the most serious time, it seemed that the "Cold War" was about to turn into a "Hot War". Fortunately, continental Europe has survived another year of peace.</p>
<p>Although the reasons for this East-West confrontation are complex and long-term, from the perspective of the past year, it actually began with the breakdown of the four-power London conference on the German peace treaty at the end of 1947. Although the breakdown of this four-power conference was not the beginning, it did strengthen and accelerate the determination and steps of Britain and the United States to organize the Western European bloc. This determination and these steps, in turn, strengthened and accelerated the Soviet Union's preparations, and the East-West "Cold War" became more and more fierce.</p>
<p>Let's start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Shortly after the breakdown of the four-power conference on Germany, on January 22 last year, British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a very important speech on foreign policy in the British House of Commons. He explained that the policy of four-power cooperation had been interrupted, and that "the free countries of Western Europe must now unite closely." He put forward the policy of a "Western European Alliance", believing that it would be a voluntary combination of various governments to discuss practical economic and military issues, and said that the five countries of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg had already begun discussions. What followed Bevin's speech was, on the one hand, the Czech coup on February 25, and on the other hand, the signing of the five-nation Brussels Treaty by Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on March 17. The result of the Czech coup was the strengthening and consolidation of the Communist Party's power in Czechoslovakia. The nature of the five-nation treaty, in a certain sense, is a defensive alliance against the Soviet Union or the Eastern European bloc. According to the provisions of the five-nation treaty, on the one hand, there is economic cooperation among the five countries, and on the other hand, the five countries jointly recognize that if one of the five countries is subjected to military attack in Europe, they must immediately assist each other. At the same time, the five countries also agreed to establish an organization for a permanent liaison conference. However, the role of this five-nation treaty is very limited without the participation of the United States and Canada. Although the historical habit of the United States is not to participate in international groups, there is no precedent for participating in foreign alliance treaties. This time, in June, the Senate passed the so-called Vandenberg Resolution, urging the United States government to participate in international regional security agreements. The bill itself is not a treaty, but it was passed by the Republican Senate, which strengthened the Democratic government's confidence and position in foreign affairs, and made President Truman know that he would not become a second Wilson. (At that time, President Truman certainly could not be sure that by the end of the year he would not only be re-elected president himself, but also have a Democratic Congress. At that time, his foreign policy actually had to be agreed to by the Republicans.) Therefore, in July, the United States, Canada, and the five countries began to discuss how to connect Western Europe and North America, and at the same time sent "observers" to attend the military conferences of the five countries. The so-called "how to connect" is the "North Atlantic Treaty" that is still under negotiation. At the same time, the "Foreign Assistance Act" (that is, the US domestic law that implements the Marshall Plan or the European Recovery Program, which is usually widely heard of) was completed through the US legal procedures and signed by President Truman on April 3. After the establishment of this law, the sixteen European recipient countries immediately gathered in Paris and established the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation". These are not just postures, but concrete measures to deal with Eastern Europe under the leadership of the United States or Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The most tense manifestation of the Cold War is not here. The most exciting scene is in Germany, where the East and West blocs meet head-on.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the German issue had already been declared broken at last year's four-power conference. This breakdown increased some international contradictions last year, and the most direct one, of course, was Germany itself.</p>
<p>As early as February last year, shortly after the breakdown of the four-power conference, Britain, the United States, and France began discussing the issue of their occupation zones in Germany in London. Later, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg joined, and from spring to summer, the six-nation agreement was announced on June 7. This agreement involves the international co-management of the Ruhr, Germany's participation in the European Recovery Program, the merger of the British, American, and French occupation zones in Germany, the establishment of a German federal government, and so on. The most important thing is, on the one hand, to bring in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and on the other hand, to decide to establish a temporary Western German government before German unification (that is, the merger of East and West Germany). In addition, Britain, the United States, and France also announced on June 18 that they would implement currency reform within their occupation zones (excluding parts of Berlin). (implemented on June 20) The Soviet Union's countermeasure was to start banning vehicle traffic between the Soviet occupation zone and the Western occupation zones from June 19. Berlin was divided into four occupation zones, but because the entire Berlin was located within the Soviet occupation zone, banning vehicle traffic between the Soviet occupation zone and the Western occupation zones was tantamount to blockading the external traffic of the British, American, and French occupation zones in Berlin. On June 23, the Soviet Union also announced the declaration of the foreign ministers' meeting of Eastern European countries, accusing the six-nation agreement of dividing Germany.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The blockade of traffic was, in the Soviet Union's view, a necessary means to deal with the West German currency reform. In fact, the Soviet Union probably also hoped to find a solution to the German issue through this. However, the two sides were not able to reach an agreement immediately. Then, the Soviet Union announced that the currency of East Germany would also be reformed, while West Germany expanded the use of the new West German currency in the Berlin occupation zone, and the Soviet Union's blockade of traffic became more and more severe. In order to maintain the daily life of the Berlin occupation zone, Britain and the United States had to use a large amount of airlift (it is said that the average daily volume was about 4,000 tons). At the same time, the governments of Britain, the United States, and France, considering that this issue could not be solved by the military authorities of the occupation zone, directly negotiated with Moscow. The three countries' representatives met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin, Foreign Minister Molotov, and Stalin in Moscow. On August 30, they reached a principle agreement that the traffic would be opened and that the German currency in the Soviet occupation zone would be the sole currency of Berlin. The specific method of four-power joint management of Berlin's currency was left to the military authorities of the four countries in Berlin to discuss. After reaching an agreement, it would be implemented immediately. However, because the military authorities of the four countries had different interpretations of this agreement, the Soviet military authorities, Sokolovsky, believed that the Soviet Union had the right to manage Berlin's external air traffic. After several discussions, there was no unanimous agreement. On September 26, the governments of Britain, the United States, and France notified the Soviet authorities that they would submit the matter to the United Nations Security Council. The problem that the four countries could not solve was unlikely to have a better solution in the Security Council. (These four countries all have veto power in the Security Council. In other words, if there is no common agreement among these four countries, the motion cannot be passed.) Therefore, although consultations were held again and again, the Security Council's motion failed to pass due to the Soviet Union's veto. Not only that, Berlin has had two municipal governments since November 30. The split deepened, and the stalemate continued. In early December, the draft North Atlantic Treaty was sent by the five countries to Washington to discuss with the United States and Canada. At the same time, the five countries also appointed a committee to discuss ways to strengthen and expand the alliance in Paris. In addition, in continental Europe, the Greek civil war, which has a very strong international meaning, has not stopped, and the Danube issue, the issue of the former Italian colonies, and the issue of the Austrian peace treaty are not known when a practical solution can be found. However, these issues, compared with the Berlin issue, have become not the most serious issues.</p>
<p>Looking at last year and thinking about this year, the situation this year may not be better than last year. The Eastern bloc continues its existing domestic and foreign policies. The Western bloc will strengthen its own organization and use the US dollars under the Marshall Plan to revive the economies of various countries. The confrontation between East and West has probably reached a point where it cannot be more acute. Whether war is likely to break out is probably something that no one dares to make a definite prediction. If we reason according to reason, war is unlikely to occur. There are only two countries in the world that are qualified to talk about war now, and these two qualified countries may not want to fight immediately, and they are geographically so far apart. Several countries within this distance have no way to fight. The Berlin issue illustrates the tension of the situation in continental Europe and the difficulty of coordination between East and West, but it also illustrates that international war will not break out in the short term. If one side wanted to fight, it would have already started. Everyone hopes to win without fighting. War cannot be fought under this kind of situation. This was the situation last year, and it may still be the case this year.</p>

<h3>Framing and Extorting Priests for Tens of Thousands of US Dollars: Police Officers Crack Major Case, Five Chinese and Foreign Criminals Apprehended, Confessing to a Total of Ten Fraud Cases Committed Before and After</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Belgian priest Georges Germain, 45 years old, resides at No. 70, Lane 135, Qunshan Road, Xijiao. He is the host of the church. Last autumn, George preached in Pan Yang, Northeast China, disguised as a German named Ke Like. Ke is 25 years old and previously studied law at Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping. He is proficient in Chinese, English, German, and Russian, and is well-versed in Chinese law. Last winter, after the Communist army entered Northeast China, Father George took refuge in Shanghai and presided over a church on Huashan Road. A month ago, George passed through the Bund Yangjingbang and unexpectedly reunited with Ke Like. They shook hands and said hello, and George told him the address of the church. A few days later, Ke visited George at the church on Huashan Road and showed him a draft for US$500, asking George to cash it. George refused because he had no cash. Ke left the draft there and left. Later, he sent several telegrams inquiring about it, but George never cashed it for him. As a result, Ke harbored a grudge. Ke then gathered a stateless rogue named Bibo, a stateless person named Elieze who specialized in making counterfeit gold bars, a White Russian named Ai Gai from No. 3, Lane 159, Wanmaoming South Road, an American named Jimei from No. 41, Xiafei Square, Linsen Middle Road, and a former Soviet manager named Zhao Yongbi to conspire to frame George. Ke asked Wang Xianzhang, a Suzhou native living at No. 60, Lane 7, North Chengdu Road, to buy three catties of apples, which Elieze used to make fake opium paste. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, Ke took it to the church and secretly placed it on the bookshelf in George's bedroom. At around 8:00 PM, Ke colluded with Bibo and Zhao Yongbi and six or seven others, wearing armbands and pretending to be police officers. They handcuffed Ke and drove him to the church, accusing Ke and George of jointly committing the crime of black market gold speculation. After George denied it, Zhao and others searched arbitrarily and found an oval-shaped piece of opium soil, weighing about several taels, on the bookshelf. Then they became fierce and insisted on arresting George and taking him away. George knew that he had been framed, but he could not defend himself. As a result, they were threatened and extorted for US$50,000. George signed a draft for US$30,000 and gave them US$1,530 in cash before they left. Later, because the signature on the US$30,000 draft did not match, it was rejected. Ke sent several telegrams to George demanding it, and George, unable to bear the harassment, reported the case to the Municipal Police Department for arrest.</p>
<p>Police Officers Dispatched to Disguise and Wait</p>
<p>Sun Dafang, Director of the Criminal Division of the Police Department, reported the case to Director Yu, who ordered the Jing'an Temple Police Branch to solve the case within a time limit. Wang Huachen and Yan Xianghu, the chief and deputy chiefs of the branch, ordered Yu Ding, the chief of the Criminal Affairs Section, to conduct a thorough investigation. Chief Yu, considering the seriousness of the case, specially convened a meeting of all criminal police officers and selected capable police officers Ye Zhijiang, Yang Zhenzhong, Lu Tianjiang, Yang Junqing, Huang Jiaqi, Zheng Jiwen, Liang Guangyu, Song Shixiang, Wu Liquan, Jin Yuqi, etc. to form a special team. Inspector Meng Ruisheng supervised each police officer to perform their duties. Chief Yu personally accompanied Inspector Meng to Father George's residence on Huashan Road to investigate the truth and seek clues, and instructed George to pretend to be conciliatory when they called, and to contact the police secretly at any time. After returning to the bureau, Yu and others dispatched a large number of police officers to wait at the criminals' entry and exit points and major hotels. At 2:00 PM on the 15th, Yu Dang Bibo, at the request of Ke Like, called George and asked him to deliver the remaining money near Linsen Middle Road, Changde Road. Chief Yu of the Police Bureau received the news and disguised himself and Inspector Meng and waited at the location. George sent Father (Belgian) Albert Devis to negotiate on his behalf. At the time, a military jeep happened to be parked at the corner of the Empire Cafe, which they suspected, and they did not dare to negotiate. The police officers did not leave until 6:30 PM at dusk.</p>
<p>Another Phone Call Asking for Payment</p>
<p>At about 7:00 PM, George received another phone call from the other party, pointing out that George had reported the case to the police authorities, saying that if the remaining US$30,000 was not handed over, they would definitely take his life. He also said that they would meet near the church at 8:00 PM tonight. George asked for a delay until tomorrow, saying that he had a banquet that night. At 8:00 AM the next morning, another phone call came, asking if the money had been prepared, and again said that the meeting place this time was a mobile location, with people following behind you at any time. They would depart from the residence at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, proceed slowly along Huashan Road, Changle Road, and St. George's Garden Ballroom. If no one came forward to negotiate, they would proceed towards Xiumei Road, as far as Linsen Road. After Father George listened, he again sent Father Ai to report to the police station. After Chief Yu and others studied the terrain and set up a dragnet, the capable officer Lu Changjiang disguised himself as a rickshaw puller and carried Chief Yu's son to school on Changle Road to wait. Sergeant Ye Zhijiang, police officers Huang Jiaqi, Yang Junqing, Xu Jian, etc. disguised themselves as newspaper vendors and hawkers. Other police officers, Jin Yuqi, Zheng Jiwen, carried Chief Yu's two daughters, Hui Yun and Xiao Lian, pretending to be young friends, carrying books and strolling nearby as cover.</p>
<p>White Russian Arrested on Du Mei Road</p>
<p>At about 3:40 PM, an airplane circled in the sky. The disguised police officers pretended to look up at the sky and suddenly saw a White Russian Ai Gai talking to Ai beside Ai on Du Mei Road. Ai then dealt with him perfunctorily, and the White Russian handed over US$1,500. When Ai walked to the intersection of Linsen Middle Road, Chief Yu and Inspector Meng, who were lying in ambush, stepped forward, arrested him, took the original loot together to the bureau. The white russian confessed that he was instructed by Ke. According to the confession of the white russian, the police went to the vicinity of the Cathay Grand Theatre to arrest Ke but failed.</p>
<p>At the same time, the branch listened to Ai Gai's confession and learned that the Western Youth Association had received a blank check, such as the one issued by the account holder Xu Qingguo. The police went to investigate and confirmed that this was the case. After checking with the bank to find out Xu's address, Xu was summoned for questioning. According to Xu, the check had been stolen by someone beforehand, and he suspected that it was done by his cohabitant Wang Xianzhang, because Wang had frequent contact with outsiders. The police arrested Wang, and Wang confessed after an interrogation. He also confessed to conspiring to threaten Father George and other cases.</p>
<p>Five Criminals Confess to Ten Cases</p>
<p>Later, the case-handling police officers waited and searched in major hotels. Two days later, they finally arrested Ke Like, Elieze, and Jimei one after another in rooms 206 and 210 of the Leyi Hotel at No. 2004 Nanjing West Road. The others, such as Bibo, are still at large. They also summoned Locke, an American teenager living in the same room, to the bureau to testify, confessing the process of their conspiracy to commit illegal acts. The criminals finally had nothing to say. In addition to issuing arrest warrants for accomplices who are at large, the police bureau transferred the five suspects, including Ke, to the District Prosecutor's Office for prosecution on charges of framing, impersonating public officials, threatening, extorting money, and forging documents. A total of ten cases were committed: (1) The aforementioned joint extortion of Father George, (2) On November 17 last year, defrauding Bai Laoqi, the principal of No. 18 Du Mei Road (French), on the grounds of selling flour, white sugar, and edible oil, and absconding with the money, (3) On the same day, defrauding Bai Laopaiste Ke, a French professor at No. 1157 Zhongzheng Middle Road, using the same method. (4) On January 19 of this year, defrauding Liang Zaiyi, a Korean merchant, of two strings of necklaces and brandy. (5) On the 18th of the same month, owing 10,000 yuan in room fees at the Paramount Hotel on Yuyuan Road and deceiving with a bounced check. (6) On the 28th of the same month, drinking coffee and purchasing six pounds of coffee at the CPC Cafe at No. 1472 Nanjing West Road and paying with a bounced check from the Datong Bank. (7) On the 7th of this month, owing more than 86,000 yuan in room and board fees at the Western Youth Association at No. 150 Nanjing West Road and paying with a check from the Xinhua Dalai Bank, which was returned upon maturity. (8) On the 17th of this month, defrauding clothes on the grounds of selling clothes for the German musician Klad and escaping. (9) Defrauding US$150 from Bai Kene, a Belgian merchant, with bad wine and fake British gold pounds. (10) Bibo, an accomplice who is at large, exchanged a fake check for US$200 from the British merchant Tang Posun and fled without a trace.</p>

<h3>Gold Exchange Has Not Received Resumption Order</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday's report stated that the city's Gold Exchange was preparing to resume operations. A reporter inquired about the details from a responsible person at the Gold Industry Association. According to the report, the association has been closed for many years. Although the government has now opened the free trading of gold and silver, the association has not yet received a formal official document, and the directors of the association have no way to follow up and prepare for the resumption of operations.</p>
<h3>The Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction Fertilizer Arrives in Shanghai; Bartering for Rice Is Being Processed</h3>
<p>Previously, the Farmers Bank of China, in order to promote chemical fertilizer and increase agricultural production, arranged with the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction (JCRR) to allocate American-aided fertilizer to Jiangsu Province. This fertilizer was to be handed over to the bank to directly barter for rice with farmers. The first batch of fertilizer, consisting of 2,041 tons of ammonium sulfate, has already been shipped to Shanghai by the "Argoyan" and "Jayense" vessels one after the other recently. In order to seize the opportunity for spring plowing, the bank is actively processing the bartering affairs. It is reported that the distribution locations are Songjiang (850 tons), Qingpu (580 tons), Jinshan (300 tons), Kunshan (261 tons), and Taicang (50 tons). The quality of this fertilizer is equivalent to about five catties of bean cake per catty of fertilizer. It is estimated that the first batch of fertilizer will benefit more than 200,000 mu of farmland.</p>
<h3>The Central Mint Will Begin Minting Silver Dollars Tomorrow; Adopting the Model from the 23rd Year of the Republic, Containing Seven Mace and One Fen and Five Li of Pure Silver</h3>
<p>The work of recasting silver coins has been actively prepared by the Central Mint in recent days. Part of the machinery has been installed and will officially begin minting tomorrow. The model used is one that the mint had previously cast in the 23rd year of the Republic. Each coin weighs 26.679 grams, containing 80% pure silver (calculated according to the old formula as seven mace, one fen, and five li), with the remainder being copper. The raw materials have already been allocated by the National Bank to the mint, consisting of many silver ingots, and the inventory is sufficient. Furthermore, the Shanghai factory currently has four machines still being installed. After the completion before the middle of March, 300,000 to 400,000 silver dollars can be minted daily.</p>
<h3>Mourning the Authority on Physics; Passing Away in a Foreign Land While Receiving Medical Treatment; Academics from Academia Sinica Gather to Hold a Memorial Service for Sa Bentong</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The late Dr. Sa Bentong, Director-General of Academia Sinica and an authority on physics, passed away in a foreign land while seeking medical treatment in the United States for cancer. Colleagues from Academia Sinica and famous figures from academic and educational circles held a memorial service at 9:00 AM yesterday in the auditorium of the institute on Yueyang Road. Those present included Zhu Jia骅, Mei Yi-qi, Hu Shi, Wu Youxun, Zhang Yuanji, Zhuang Changgong, Hang Liwu, Du Zuozhou, Ren Hongjun, Zhou Tongqing, Wu Junsheng, Li Bake, Yang Chuoan, Wang Zhizhuo, Shen Xilian, Zhao Zengjue, as well as the directors of various institutes of the Academia Sinica, all colleagues, and relatives and friends of Sa Bentong, totaling several hundred people. A portrait of Sa Bentong was hung on the front of the auditorium, with a eulogy from his family below. On a long table in front were a pair of silver candles and a censer. A vase of fresh flowers and four plates of flowers and three plates of green fruit were offered on the stage. Numerous wreaths were displayed beside the stage, and the four walls were covered with elegiac couplets from various circles. Beside the portrait was an elegiac couplet from Zhu Jia骅, which read: "Grieving that a brief illness has become an eternal farewell, I recall asking about his illness in Zhongshan, waving goodbye in Longhua, and seeking to heal his ailment in a new land. I originally hoped that there would always be a way to return to spring. Remembering three years of mutual support, I deeply admired his unparalleled talent and extraordinary intelligence. I scratch my head and ask the heavens, why do you begrudge me this person?" Wang Shijie and Hang Liwu's elegiac couplet read: "Why did you leave in such a hurry? News from overseas startled us from our dreams. Why doesn't Heaven pity us? The Huangpu River sobs, expressing our sorrow." Ren Hongjun's elegiac couplet read: "Establishing words and deeds, writing books in bed, truly a vigorous person; governing learning and affairs, passing on the flame endlessly, what other is there like him?" The Institute of Physics of Academia Sinica's elegiac couplet read: "Looking at the land, with smoke everywhere, thorns covering the ground, how can academic research be discussed? I wish his spirit would fly across the ocean and return to protect the Jiuhua Mountains. For two years in the Changwu Institute, he exhausted his heart and soul, toiling and complaining, and devoted himself to mathematics and physics but did not complete his work. Knowing that Mr. Sa was ill and using different instruments, he died in bitterness in San Francisco."</p>
<h3>New Transportation Prices on Two Railways to Be Implemented Next Month; Surprise Inspections Strictly Prohibit Ticketless Passengers</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the relocation of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration south by the Executive Yuan, the evacuation of public employees and large-scale telegram transportation have disrupted the traffic order and all original administrative systems. Passenger and freight transportation once nearly came to a complete standstill. Ninety percent of all vehicles were allocated for military and public transportation. During this period, the railway bureau suffered huge losses in revenue. Subsequently, labor strikes occurred one after another, and the result of repeated unrest created an unprecedented economic crisis for the two railways today. In order to solve this crisis, Wang Zhaohuai, the director of the bureau, resolutely decided to automatically adjust passenger and freight prices by four times on the 12th of this month, believing that the problem could be solved, but it was not. Although the transportation prices increased four times, the actual revenue increased by less than two times. According to the spokesman of the bureau, there are two reasons for this: (1) The economic strength of the people is generally low, and railway transportation prices have been far behind general prices in the past ten years. The public has become accustomed to low transportation prices, so passengers will inevitably decrease every time passenger tickets are initially adjusted. (2) As the war approaches the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou areas, the number of troops stationed along the two railways has greatly increased. Ticketless military passengers on trains sometimes exceed ordinary passengers. Moreover, some lawless soldiers are also engaged in running single businesses, smuggling "yellow croakers." Recently, it has been discovered that a small number of railway bureau employees are also participating in this activity. This has a significant impact on the railway bureau's revenue. In view of the first reason mentioned above, the two railways authorities, in accordance with the formulaic adjustment of transportation prices stipulated by the Ministry of Transportation, such as establishing joint inspection teams to conduct surprise inspections at any time in conjunction with the Garrison Headquarters and various military units, strictly prohibit railway bureau employees and soldiers from smuggling "yellow croakers" and various ticketless passengers. Once discovered, they will be severely punished, it is said.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiahua Delivers a Eulogy Praising Sa's Achievements</h3>
<p>The meeting started at 9:00 AM. The funeral music was played, and the ceremony was conducted as scheduled. Chairman Zhu Jiahua presented a wreath, and the Academia Sinica, the Alumni Association of Xiamen University, and the Fujian Fellow Villagers Association paid their respects in succession and read the eulogy. Then, Zhu delivered a eulogy, recalling Sa's experience as the Director-General of Academia Sinica, praising Sa's efforts to develop the work of the institute and his achievements in establishing the Center for Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry in Nanjing under difficult conditions, and reporting on Sa's situation in seeking medical treatment in the United States. He also stated: "Mr. Sa's contribution to science is very great. His death is a great loss to the future of science and to the country. Last week, the institute held an administrative meeting and decided to rename the Physics Laboratory of the newly built Center for Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry as the Bentong Hall. In addition, we want to establish a Bentong Scholarship as a memorial after the currency system is stabilized. Mr. Sa's will is to send his ashes to Tsinghua University, Xiamen University, or Academia Sinica. If everyone wants it, then divide it into three parts. I don't think it is appropriate to separate the ashes, so I want to ask Tsinghua and Xiamen University first. If they are willing to give up, then Academia Sinica will accept it. I am very sad when I bring up these things. We should follow Mr. Sa's tenacious and outstanding spirit to engage in work. This is the best way for us to commemorate Mr. Sa."</p>
<h3>Wu Youxun Reports on Sa's Life and Deeds While Shedding Tears</h3>
<p>Then, Wu Youxun, the former president of National Central University, reported on Sa's life and deeds, stating briefly: Sa was born in Minhou, Fujian in July 1902. In 1921, he graduated from Tsinghua School and was sent to the United States, entering Stanford University to study mechanical engineering. In 1924, he obtained a bachelor's degree and transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The following year, he obtained a degree in electrical engineering and transferred to study physics. Two years later, he obtained a doctorate in physics. In 1927, he left school and was hired by Westinghouse Electric Company as an engineer. In 1928, he returned to China and was hired by Tsinghua University as a professor in the Department of Physics for as long as eight years. In 1936, he went to the United States again and was hired by Ohio State University as a visiting professor. He returned to China a year later, and on the eve of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was hired as the president of Xiamen University for seven years. In 1944, he went to the United States again, serving as a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University. In 1945, he returned to China and served as the Director-General of Academia Sinica until the day of his death. He has written extensively, especially his physics textbooks, which are famous at home and abroad. Wu and Sa were old friends for twenty years, and he was unable to speak without tears during the report. Finally, he stated: "Today, we mourn him and deeply and forever remember his learning, morality, and writings."</p>
<p>Then, Mei Yi-qi, the president of Tsinghua University, gave a speech stating: "Bentong's death when he was very accomplished in his career and learning is a great loss and very regrettable. But upon closer reflection, we don't have to be too sad. Everyone has to die once. In addition to illness, there are many reasons why a person cannot continue to work. Bentong's death from illness is because he was too serious about his work. He was very young. When he was studying at Tsinghua, I could see from his playing tennis and being a Boy Scout that he was very serious and very fair in everything he did. He is worthy of the word 'Integrity' in English. We should use him as an example."</p>
<h3>Hu Shi Praises Sa's Four Careers in His Speech</h3>
<p>Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, said in his speech: "Mr. Sa's career has four aspects, namely Tsinghua University, Xiamen University, Academia Sinica, and his writings. His teaching method is very good. He taught physics at Peking University for a year. Because he taught so well, his successor was not welcomed by the students after he left. He ran Xiamen University, which was the best university in the country during the War of Resistance Against Japan. He was too responsible for running Academia Sinica, which delayed his illness. The textbooks he wrote are also very successful. His twenty-year career has invisibly influenced countless people, so I agree with President Mei's point of view. I think that although Mr. Sa has passed away, his spirit is immortal."</p>
<p>Then, Du Zuozhou, the former president of Yingshi University, gave a speech, expressing his admiration for the spirit of running the school when Lian was in charge of Xiamen University. Finally, the family representative gave a thank-you speech, the funeral music was played, and the ceremony was completed. The memorial service for this perfect figure in the academic world ended in a sea of sorrow.</p>

<h3>Female Students from the National Conservatory of Music "Evacuate" and Reside in Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The National Conservatory of Music is located near the Jiangwan Airport.

After President Dai of the school contacted Jiaotong University, President Wang of Jiaotong University agreed to allow 17 female students from the Conservatory to reside in the university. The issue of male students residing together is still under consideration.</p>
<h3>Students from Seven National Universities in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing Petition the Acting President, Asking for a Solution to the Crisis and Making Four Demands</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The presidents of various national universities and colleges in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou joined forces last night to go to Nanjing and request the central government to improve the treatment of faculty and staff, increase funding, and issue contingency funds. Yesterday, Fudan students held a meeting to bid farewell to their school's president, Zhang Yi, who went to Nanjing. The student organizations of seven national universities in Shanghai, namely Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Tongji University, Jinan University, the Conservatory of Music, Tangshan Institute of Technology, and the Vocational School for Teachers of Early Childhood Education, jointly petitioned Acting President Li, which President Zhang took to Nanjing to submit. The contents roughly stated: "Under the circumstances of constantly rising prices, the salaries of professors are only worth three silver dollars. The school's operating expenses are not enough to pay for one month's water and electricity bills. Staff cannot support their families, and workers and police can barely drink porridge. As for our students, the average food allowance for students enjoying public funding cannot even buy half a fried dough stick a day, and they simply cannot get enough to eat. And today, there are still many self-funded students who cannot even afford the meals needed to maintain this standard of living and can only go to school with empty stomachs every day. This shows that not only is education on the verge of bankruptcy, but it is also pushing the survival of teachers, students, staff, and police to the brink of desperation. Our demands are: (1) Increase the treatment of professors, staff, workers, and police and the amount of public funding, and adjust it every half month according to the Shanghai Municipal Employee Price Index. (2) Increase the school's operating expenses and issue them early. (3) Immediately issue sufficient contingency funds for three months of expenses and living expenses for all teachers, students, staff, and police in all schools. (4) All students should be treated as publicly funded."</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Student Union's Propaganda Appeals to Students with Ten Points</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The "Shanghai Student Union," led by the Chinese Communist Party, yesterday mimeographed and distributed two types of propaganda, one being the "Shanghai Student Union's Declaration on Striving for Democratic Survival Rights and Maintaining the Education Cause," and the other being the "Declaration Supporting the CCP's Eight Conditions, Striving for True Peace, and Responding to the Call of the Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Conference," and attached a misprinted "Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Conference's Letter to Shanghai Citizens on the Current Situation," in which the peace movement advocated by Acting President Li was severely criticized. In its declaration on maintaining the education cause, it appealed to the educational circles and students of this city with the following points: (1) Demand that the reactionary government release all arrested students; (2) Allow expelled patriotic students to return to school to attend classes; (3) Automatically resume publication of banned student publications; (4) Demand school funding from the reactionary government; (5) Demand contingency funds from the reactionary government; (6) Demand a unified bonus from the reactionary government; (7) Demand the school's association from the reactionary government; (8) Promote anti-war and disintegrate the garrison among soldiers; (9) Prevent bureaucratic capital from fleeing south; (10) Return the people's fat to the people. In its declaration on supporting the CCP's eight conditions, it specifically pointed out that the government is concentrating its efforts on two aspects. First: "Making every effort to preserve the power of the reactionary clique, so that it can safely get through the current revolutionary storm sweeping the country, in order to seize the opportunity at the appropriate time to make a comeback, hoping to get three months of respite, reorganizing and newly forming dozens of divisions for combat." Second aspect: "Distorting the content of the eight peace conditions, turning it from true peace into false peace," and "Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren are thus dividing the work: Chiang is in charge of the first task, and Li is in charge of the second task." It also stated: "Although some people deliberately exaggerate the contradictions between Chiang and Li in order to make people have illusions about Li and think he is very good, they are consistent in their anti-people and counter-revolutionary stance, and also because they are at the behest of the same master—American imperialism, their act has always been well-matched." In the declaration, Liang Shuming, who had been silent for a long time in retirement, recently wrote an article calling for peace, which was denounced as "helping the reactionaries carry out conspiracies to preserve their strength." At the same time, it pointed out that "Liu Bugu, Wan Meizi, and L Mang's public activities" are "the government's attempt to sow reactionary seeds on the land after the victory of the people's revolution." Finally, it called on the students of this city to use their own strength to liberate Shanghai.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At around 9:00 PM last night, a shooting incident occurred at the Jue Lu Hotel on South Tibet Road. The injured person was Zhu Yuanming, a 24-year-old from Hubei who was staying at the hotel and engaged in transportation. Last night, Zhu and his friend Yao Chengkai were chatting in room 456 on the fourth floor when four people wearing red clothes suddenly arrived. One of them carried a Type 38 rifle, and one carried a pistol. They entered the room and talked for a long time. Then Zhu went out with the four people. When they arrived at the escalator on the second floor, one of them used a pistol to fire a shot at Zhu's waist. Zhu fell to the ground in response. The four people immediately went downstairs to escape but were discovered and chased by the tea server. At the same time, the hotel's accounting room sent a telegram to the Laozha Police Branch to dispatch personnel to rush to the scene to arrest them. As a result, two people were arrested and taken to the police station for interrogation.

<h3>A Fake Doctor Treats Illnesses and Collects Money; Exposed and Detained by the Police Station for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Fu Keming, a 20-year-old employee of the Li Da Xiang Cotton Cloth Shop at 399 Jiangsu Road, was receiving customers in the shop at around 4:00 PM on the 26th when two men suddenly came, pretending to be doctors, treating people for illnesses for free and not taking any money. They also promoted it to their colleagues, saying that Fu had lung disease and could be treated. After being led upstairs, they placed a Chinese medicine inside Fu's navel, with a copper object on top, shaped like a teacup, connected to a leather tube, with an inflator connected to the end of the tube. After inflating it several times, something was sucked out of the belly, resembling a gelatinous substance. The person removed the copper instrument and said that there was a disease in the abdomen, which has now been sucked out and can be improved, but instructed that a kind of pill must be swallowed, and that the pill must be purchased from a foreign pharmacy, otherwise it can be purchased from them for three silver dollars per pill, a total of nine silver dollars for three pills. Later, colleagues discovered it and knew that it was a pretext to swindle money, so they called the police and took them to the police station for interrogation. According to their confession, one is Liu Changtong, a 37-year-old from Henan, and the other is Zeng Fangjun, a 40-year-old from Wuhu. In fact, they were wandering in a foreign land and lacking means to make a living, so they came up with this inferior plan.</p>

Hua Lian achieved seven wins in seven games in the A Division First Group, while the Green Team secured four wins in four games in the Women's Division, both maintaining flawless records. Despite a valiant effort, the Shanghai Police Force ultimately succumbed to the more experienced Hua Lian team with a score of 51 to 42, the halftime score being 23 to 13. The Shanghai Police Force appeared flustered at the start, falling behind by a dozen points, allowing Hua Lian to take the lead and maintain it throughout the game, ultimately winning by nine points. Hua Lian's veterans' steadiness was the main reason for their victory, while the Shanghai Police Force's all-out effort and meticulousness were also commendable. In the Women's Division, Xinghua's absence due to forfeit resulted in a walkover victory for the Line Team. In the A Division Second Group D, the Red Cavalry team defeated the Shantou team by a score of 38 to 37 in overtime, winning by one point. The gymnasium was packed to capacity last night, with over three thousand spectators, creating an exceptionally enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Casual Chat about Yandang Tea</h3>
<p>— Wang Liao</p>
<p>Yandang Mountain is located in the eastern countryside of Yueqing. The scenery is majestic, and the rocks are extraordinary. Peaks like Tianzhu Peak rise abruptly from the ground, standing tall in the clouds, inspiring awe. Waterfalls cascade from great heights, resembling white silk ribbons. Jiang Tao Shu of the Qing Dynasty famously wrote, "It's hard to capture the waterfalls in writing, a life un-Yandang-ed is a wasted life," which vividly depicts the beauty of Yandang's scenery. Every year, countless visitors come to Yandang in the spring and autumn, drawn by its reputation.</p>
<p>The Naming of Tea! (II)</p>
<p>[Report from Yueqing, 14th] Yandang Mountain boasts numerous specialties. Besides dried pomfret and various medicinal herbs, Yunwu Tea (Cloud and Mist Tea) is also well-known. Yandang Mountain's tea leaves, produced in areas like Longqiu Bei and Doushuai Dong, are referred to as "Yunwu Tea," similar to those produced in Wuyi Mountain in Fujian Province and Tiantai Mountain in this province. Tea trees thrive in temperate climates and prefer humidity. They grow exceptionally well in areas with mist and less sunlight. Therefore, tea leaves from high mountains and deep valleys, blessed by the mist and a favorable environment, are of particularly high quality. This is how Yunwu Tea gets its name!</p>
<p>Yandang Mountain's Yunwu Tea is considered the best when produced in Doushuai Dong, followed by Longqiu Bei, then Da Longqiu, and finally Lingyan Temple Beidou Dong area, which is considered the lowest grade. In terms of the natural environment, Doushuai Dong has the highest altitude. Its rocky peaks overlap, reaching the sky. The duration of sunlight is short, only from 10 AM to 4 PM. From February to November, the area is shrouded in mist, creating a gloomy atmosphere. Even in summer, it is not hot but rather cool. However, the winter climate is clearer. The natural environment of Longqiu Bei is also excellent, similar to Doushuai Dong, but its altitude is slightly lower. Da Longqiu is located at the foot of Longqiu Bei, making it slightly inferior. In addition, Lingyan Temple Beidou Dong and other areas are located on plains, making them far less suitable. In terms of tea quality, Doushuai Dong tea contains more theine and tannin. It can be steeped multiple times in boiling water, and the final brew still tastes fragrant. (Water content is about 31%, theine about 2%, tannin about 16%, ash about 5%, and soluble matter about 34%). Longqiu Bei tea can be steeped twice. As for the tea produced in Da Longqiu and Lingyan Temple Beidou Dong, it is merely ordinary tea.</p>
<p>Miraculous Tea for Healing</p>
<p>Tea is made from the tender leaves of tea trees and acts as a stimulant, capable of relieving physical and mental fatigue. The tea leaves produced in Doushuai Dong have a unique and miraculous effect in treating chest and headache pain. A neighbor of mine, over 40 years old, suffered from chest and headache pain. Western and Chinese medicine were ineffective, and the pain was unbearable. He was unable to work, and his career was ruined by this illness. This summer, he met a Daoist from Doushuai Dong, who gave him half a catty of Doushuai Dong tea leaves. He drank it three times a day, and this long-standing illness miraculously disappeared. Although there is no scientific explanation, the clinical experience is extremely effective, further convincing me of the value of Doushuai Dong tea leaves.</p>
<p>Around Grain Rain</p>
<p>The harvest season for Yunwu Tea is usually around Grain Rain (a solar term). At this time, the new tea buds have opened into four leaves. The tip and the top three leaves are picked, leaving one leaf behind. Sometimes, when the new buds have opened into five leaves, the top three leaves are picked. Tender leaves can be picked three times. The first batch of buds is of excellent quality, making high-grade tea. The yield is small. The third batch of buds yields six times more than the first batch, but the quality of the tea is much lower. After the tea leaves are picked on a clear day, they are sorted according to quality, and coarse debris is removed. They are processed immediately. Tea picked in the afternoon must be processed completely at night. If processing is delayed, methods must be found to store the leaves to prevent wilting and fermentation. The villagers do not have large-scale factories and lack scientific knowledge, so they adhere to traditional methods of tea production, which involves steaming, kneading, drying, and selecting. Eight catties of fresh leaves from the roasting stove can produce two catties of dried tea. After the tea is made, it must be kept dry and protected from moisture. Tin containers are preferred for storage. If not stored properly, the aroma will dissipate, microorganisms will invade, and the fragrance will weaken, making the tea worthless. If the tea leaves are dried in the sun to save costs, they will be of inferior quality.</p>
<p>Theine and Tannin</p>
<p>The main components of tea leaves are theine and tannin. Theine tastes bitter and is poisonous, but the content is very low. It has the effect of treating physical and mental fatigue. Tannin has the effect of refreshing the mind and strengthening the stomach. The two combine to form tannic acid, which is easily soluble in boiling water, making people feel refreshed after drinking. Theine and tannin are mostly found in tender leaves, so high-grade tea is made from tender leaves, resulting in a better fragrance and taste. As the time the tea leaves are steeped in boiling water increases (tea leaves are not easily dissolved in lukewarm water), the soluble components also increase. The phenomenon of tannin is the most obvious. According to agricultural chemists, mist has a great influence on the growth of tea leaves. Because during the month or so from the time the tea trees sprout to the time they are picked, they receive less sunlight and more smog, the amount of theine in the tea leaves increases, while the amount of astringency decreases, reducing the bitter taste of the tea juice. On the contrary, tea leaves that receive sufficient sunlight and lack mist have the opposite composition. The value of Yunwu Tea lies in this, and this is the reason for its name.</p>
<p>Sold Out</p>
<p>Many teas sold in the market are counterfeit because the amount of tea produced in Doushuai Dong and Longqiu Bei is limited. During the tea season, it is sold out quickly. This spring, I traveled around Yandang for over a week, searching for Yunwu Tea in vain. Later, after much effort, I climbed to Longqiu Bei and, after begging, finally bought a small amount from a tea farmer, making it feel even more precious. The method of evaluating the quality of tea leaves requires considering several points, including shape, color, fire level, water color, steaming heat, aroma, taste, storage, and cultivation. However, those who are addicted to tea can tell the quality of the tea with just one sip.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, due to transportation difficulties, the production of Yandang tea decreased sharply, and the local people mostly neglected it. After the victory, it gradually improved. Recently, there has been a proposal to build Yandang into an international park. The prosperity of a famous mountain also marks the time for its famous products to shine. Therefore, improving the tea-making method and widely planting tea trees are urgent tasks.</p>
<h3>Small Inland Waterway Ferries Should Have Ship Documents</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Ministry of Communications believes that many small ferries currently sailing on inland waterways do not follow regulations for handling procedures and obtaining the necessary ship documents, and are sailing on various ports without authorization, making safety questionable. In order to avoid accidents, the Ministry has specially requested the county governments to assist in conducting inspections at any time. If small ferries are found operating in the counties' jurisdiction without the necessary ship documents or with expired inspections, they should be temporarily detained. The Ministry will then order the shipping companies to complete the procedures. In addition, ships without passenger capacity certificates that carry passengers or ships with certificates that exceed the passenger limit should be strictly banned, and the excess passengers should be ordered to disembark before the ship is allowed to sail, in order to ensure safety.</p>

Regarding the settlement allowance for the new recruits, the County Recruitment Committee and township chiefs held a meeting on the 24th and decided that each recruit would receive 12 shi of rice and 1 shi of conscription fee. Although these figures are 2 shi lower than last year's standard, the people are burdened with heavy burdens, and the officials also feel deeply troubled.</p>
<p>Baoshan</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zhang Yahua, speaker of the Baoshan County Council, recently sent a telegram to Ding Zhipan, Chairman of Jiangsu Province and Commander of the Military Control Zone, requesting a postponement of the conscription. The telegram stated: Baoshan is a small county with a small area and sparse population. The total population of the county, including men, women, old, and young, is only about 110,000 to 120,000. Recently, a large number of troops have gathered, requiring the supply of side dishes and fodder, costing thousands of gold yuan per day. In addition, the construction of military projects requires materials, exceeding hundreds of millions of yuan. The order to conscript soldiers this time has left local township chiefs at a loss, and many have resigned and fled, creating a chaotic situation. Therefore, a telegram is sent to earnestly request your approval to postpone the conscription in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>

According to a letter from our Chongming correspondent, the statement in the article regarding food is quite different from the actual situation. The letter points out: (1) Chongming's main products are corn, rice, soybeans, and cotton. The food supply is sufficient to meet the needs of the island. The sale of Chongming corn and yuan wheat in the Shanghai market proves this. The statement in the original article about not having enough food for two or three months is clearly not true. (2) Chongming's cultural level is not low. Newspaper distribution points are located in all the towns and fortresses. The newspaper fee is increased by 10% of the newspaper's price and collected at the end of the month. Major Shanghai newspapers have a considerable circulation in Chongming, totaling about 1,500 copies. In Baozhen alone, every store subscribes to one or two copies on a regular basis. In addition to this newspaper, Xinmin, Ta Kung Pao, Central Daily News, Yishi, Southeast Daily, China Times, and Lih Pao are also available. This newspaper and Xinmin each account for about one-third of the total, and the rest account for the remaining one-third. Based on this, a correction should be made as above.</p>
