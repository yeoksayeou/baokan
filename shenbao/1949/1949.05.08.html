<p>〔中央社西安七日電〕據甫自太原逃來此間之陽曲縣長張克寒氏告記者：太原於四月廿四日被匪攻破，徐匪向前部於死傷七萬餘人後，於是晨八時，首先突入大北門，各門旋亦為匪滲入，守軍逐戶抵抗，迄午後二時，戰事停止，城內軍民死亡達四萬餘，死傷枕藉，血肉模糊，城內房屋幾均已倒塌，匪軍張貼佈告，竟無法覓得完整墻壁。省委梁敦厚當日即引刀就義，王靖國，孫楚及戴炳南各將軍均被俘，渠等於首義門登車赴榆次集中營時，遭匪軍毒打，王氏左額被擊甚重，血流如注。我卅軍戴炳南部之四個團，則於四月廿四日撤至城東至虎山向東突圍，可能至新鄉與四十軍李振清部合股，張氏係偕同平定縣張縣長於四月廿七日化裝逃出，僅太原榆次間即遭受檢查達廿七次之多。據稱，太原經此大刧，光復舊觀恐須至廿年之後也。</p>
<h3>馬尾決設要塞部</h3>
<p>〔本報福州七日電〕馬尾要塞司令部卽成立，司令官林潞生已奉命來榕籌備一切。</p>
<h3>永定永修兩艦　突圍抵廈經過　壯烈氣慨光輝史頁</h3>
<p>〔中央社廈門七日電〕海軍「永定」「永修」兩艦，參加長江保衛戰，於南京江陰等地易手後，在共軍射擊下突圍，頃先後抵廈。據「永定」艦長劉德凱，「永修」艦長桂宗炎與記者談該兩艦突圍經過稱：該艦等原奉令擔任長江佈防，保衛安慶，蕪湖等沿江要地，曾予共軍以重大打擊，迨共軍渡江，方奉令撤退，其時沿江計有軍艦十餘艘，惟分佈各段，並不集中，「永定」艦於四月廿二日由安慶出發，率領各艦東下，在長江兩岸密集砲火夾擊下，奮勇抵抗，卒衝出重圍，於廿四日抵滬，艦身多處遭砲擊受損，幸未中要害，各艦官兵死傷慘重，其壯烈之氣慨，堪為中國海軍戰史光輝之一頁，因上海接近戰區，艦身待修，遂駛廈修理整頓。</p>
<h3>綏遠士氣極旺盛　局部和平說無稽</h3>
<p>〔中央社寗夏七日電〕綏遠來人談：綏遠前綫士氣極為旺盛，外傳局部和平之說實屬無稽，董其武主席曁各將領已一再表示決與共匪作戰到底，北平國軍自被共方改編後，傳部軍官逃抵歸綏者已達九千餘人，士兵尙未計算在內，此批官兵鑒於北平局部和平之受騙，作戰意志尤為堅決。</p>

<h3>美報警告菲律賓　防第五縱隊滲入</h3>
<p>〔中央社馬尼剌六日專電〕美商所辦之馬尼剌公報，頃警告菲律賓謹防蘇聯之勢力，以中共之外表為掩護，此對於菲律賓將極為危險。該報評論陳納德所稱共黨如征服中國，終將使亞洲整個喪失一語稱，服膺民主主義之任何國家，均不應忽視中國之情勢，尤以菲律賓為然。菲律賓決不能學鴕鳥之埋首沙中，如中國方面確有蘇聯之陰謀與勢力活動，則菲律賓必須警惕。蘇聯之計劃，決不致止於中國，而將擴及其他東方國家，然所所採用者，非為武力而為滲入之第五縱隊。</p>
<h3>胡適對美記者談話　國軍仍可望獲勝　全亞洲之命運繫於中國</h3>

<h3>新省漢族文促會　在迪化隆重揭幕　將針對局勢研討各方案</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化七日電〕代表全疆廿二萬漢族人民之漢族文化促進會，頃召開十縣分會代表大會，六日晨十時在迪隆重揭幕，到庫車以北十六縣漢族代表七十一人，預定會期為五日，將針對當前省內外局勢，研討團結進步及改善人民生活，確保北緯和平等方案。鮑爾漢主席在開幕典禮致詞，渠追贊漢族悠久文化，及先哲民主政治思想後，希望全體漢族同胞繼續發揚以往漢族光榮，對人類作偉大。渠繼闡釋當前新省施政方向，堅決保證親蘇政策，決不致損害國家民族利益，渠並表明執行親蘇政策態度稱，欲求新疆人民不再陷入任何動亂，但不作出賣歷史之千古罪人，博得全場熱烈鼓掌。繼由劉秘書長孟純致詞，對和談破裂後之大局，表示絕不灰心，渠認為內地局勢不論如何轉變，新疆應以最大力量，保障全省和平，使不受戰火威脅。劉氏並要求全疆漢族同胞自反自省，力求進步，加強團結，以保障漢族在新疆之生活前途。</p>
<h3>新省探採貴金屬　決定籌設礦務局</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化七日電〕新省為開發地下礦產，應當前需要，決定籌設貴金屬礦務局，由地質調查所所長王恒升博士兼任該局籌備主任，王氏現尙因公滯留內地，關於該局組織大綱，已經省府方面擬就，俟王升氏返迪後，即開始貴金屬之探勘採治工作。</p>
<h3>美參院撥款小組委會　着手調查對華政策　蒲立德建議派魏德邁陳納德來華</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓六日電〕參院撥款小組委員會六日從事準備工作，俾正式調查美國對華政策。</p>
<p>共和黨參議員白列琪斯稱，委員會獲有情報，知白宮曾阻止陸軍在歐戰後提出將鹵獲之德國武器軍火運交中國國民政府之計劃</p>
<p>調查對華政策，由白列琪斯與小組委員會主席麥卡倫從事準備工作，國務卿艾契遜則坐在彼等前面之見證席上，白氏與麥氏提出若干詢問，請艾契遜於日後答覆。</p>
<p>白列琪斯要求助理國務卿畢利福埃供給一九三〇年以來國務院遠東司服務人員，以及一九四三年以來處理對德關係人員之姓名，渠特別指出蘇維斯及戴維士兩人，要求知悉兩氏之過去紀錄。</p>
<p>麥氏要求獲得國務院遠東司司長白特華斯及其前任者文生（現任美國駐瑞士公使）之紀錄。</p>
<p>據白氏告報界稱，渠要求撥款小組委員會調查對華政策，乃因其餘諸人莫不避免顧及之故。渠不得不召請國務院中熟悉對華政策發展之官員發表意見，然後再召請艾契遜，問其將來如何行動。渠更欲知關於拆除德國工廠機械之實況，並將試圖獲得偵查官員是否忠於國家之記錄，但不期望政府公佈此等紀錄。</p>
<p>麥氏問國務院提議撥款在韓國設大使館，是否失着，因「共產黨若佔有中國，則短時間內更將併吞日本與韓國。」</p>
<p>畢利福埃答稱，「雖然通貨稍有膨脹」，該國並未被共黨佔有，「余信若有美國旗飄揚於大使館，將有助於鼓勵抵抗力」。</p>
<p>白列琪斯請艾契遜供給一九三〇年來國務院處理中國與德國事宜之官員名單，「庶我人可知中國之悲劇及在德國之蠢愚行為，究竟何人負責」。</p>
<p>關於陸軍部會提議以德國武器運交中國之計劃，艾契遜謂不知其詳。白氏乃請艾契遜加以調查，然後說明曾否有一白宮助理官員名洛克者，於若干德國武器已在運華途中時，仍撤回武器運華命令。艾契遜同意以情報供給參院撥款小組委員會。</p>
<p>白氏又告畢利福埃稱，關於國務院「清除對國家忠心成問題之人員」一事，渠日後將提出質問，共黨份子之「最圓滑」者，決不加入被列為具有破壞性之組織</p>
<p>畢利福埃稱，就渠所知國務院中並無共黨份子，但「使余担心之人，君與余均不識之」。渠對目前情形「頗感欣慰」，並相信國務院或國會並無憂慮之必要。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕共和黨眾議員傑克遜六日要求對調查美國遠東政策之議案迅速表決。此案由傑氏與參議員諾蘭兩人提出，據傑氏稱，法規委員會對之頗為注意，惟欲提交眾院討論，須先由法規委員會通過。該案主張由參眾兩院議員各五人組織委員會，詳細調查美國之遠東政策，並授權委員會決定於何處開會，及起草美國未來政策之建議。惟委員會能否在遠東開會，並無決定。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓六日電〕前任大使蒲立德六日促請杜魯門總統派遣魏德邁與陳納德兩將軍前往中國，協助組織國民政府以共黨之抵抗，惟蒲氏認為除非與情以壓力加諸政府，否則頗少美國將及時行動之望。</p>
<p>蒲氏接見合眾社記者談話，並主張利用美國白銀，增強國民政府之經濟及充軍餉。蒲氏力主行動宜迅速，稱「杜魯門總統應立刻派一頭等作戰將領，最好是魏德邁，前往中國，俾就戰略，戰術，給養，勤務，訓練及其他一切抵抗方面，提供諮詢意見，同時我人在日本及沖繩島所有大量剩餘飛機應交予陳納德組成一有效之空軍」。</p>
<h3>美一礦公司職員　控美吸走我白銀</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓七日電〕紐蒙特開礦公司職員西爾斯七日控斥美國「源源吸走」中國白銀，以致共產主義在中國進行。西氏在參院小組委員會內陳述，贊成新開出及煉就黃金得在美國自由買賣之法案。渠稱，「中國不少絕望與不幸之發生，由於吾人拿走彼等認為貨幣之白銀，無怪彼等變成共黨」。</p>
<h3>英續派巡艦駛港　並增強西太平洋防務</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦六日民〕政府發言人六日宣布，英國已派巡洋艘及噴火式戰鬥機一隊開往香港增防，據空軍部宣布，此項戰鬥機隊即可自馬來出發，機數約九架至十八架，現駐香港之軍用機僅有桑特蘭水上機數架。同時據海軍部宣布，派往香港之巡洋艦為八千噸牙買加號，正自西印度取道珍珠港開往香港，預定本月三十一日可到。此外尙有軍艦四艘派往西太平洋增防，計為八千噸巡洋艦毛利希亞斯號一艘，驅逐艦彗星號一艘及輕巡洋艦二艘。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦七日電〕英保守黨之「每日郵報」七日晨載有社論，謂英國遠東之前哨今有變成另一柏林之危險，英政府亟應作不恤任何代價，保衛香港之切實宣言，今固有空泛之保證聲明，英國擬保持其地位，但此猶嫌不足。</p>
<p>〔路透社坎培拉八日電〕澳國防部長台特曼，七日被詢及澳洲將如何協助英國處理香港局勢時，答稱澳洲將先觀察香港局勢發展的情形，然後再發表有關該地之聲明或採取有關該地的行動。渠透露至目前為止，英國尙未請求澳洲給予援助。</p>
<h3>紫水晶號艦　三官員獲勳</h3>

<h3>星期論壇　經濟的絕路和生機</h3>
<p>— 馬大英</p>
<p>鈔荒正襲擊每一個城市，而銀元的瘋狂上漲，使一切的商業，都要停止了；經濟正大步地走上了絕路。每一個人的生存，都受着嚴重的威脅，是社會總崩潰的開始嗎？還是世界末日的來臨呢？</p>
<p>這樣一個岌岌不可終日的經濟危局，甚於政治和軍事的變化，如果沒有辦法應付，會使一切都完了。然而問題則很簡單，對於金圓券喪失信心，對於政府的任何政策不再信任而已。然而這還不是最大和真正的危機。真正的危機，在於執政者沒有正視和承認事實的勇氣，沒有改絃更張的智慧，而尤其可惡者，則為緊握現實利益不肯放手，大有寗可誤盡天下蒼生，不可損我毫髪的氣概，才有今天的困難，而造成今日不可收拾的僵局。</p>
<p>今天辦法是有的，而最難者，莫過於財政金融當局，製造種種藉口，不樂意國家有辦法。這絕不是誣　之詞。老百姓是騙不得的，而我們從去年八月改革幣制起，歷有財政金融或經濟改革方案之類，卻總在用紙票子煌老百姓的眼睛上打主意，從不肯有真正的改革，老百姓看夠了，不要再看，金圓券的價值，一再低落，實在沒有人想要了，於是乎恁憑印刷機轉得怎樣快，鈔票儘量增加，但其全體的總價值，則急遽低落，這便是無可補救的鈔荒。這是「以騙治天下」的當然結果。這件事，真的無可挽救嗎？</p>
<p>為了少數豪門及某部曲的利益，國計是不足顧而民生也無足恤，這才是真正的問題，也就是中國之所以成為今日中國的真正理由。發鈔票是豪門吸血的利器，全國經濟走上絕路，那裏值得他們憐惜？</p>
<p>在通貨膨脹之後，除了行使硬幣而外，別無有效辦法，而在事實上，今日中國已是銀幣世界，而以銀幣表示的物價，相當平穩；但我們不承認這種事實，也不肯就這種現成的基礎謀改革。拋出的金銀，不落於豪門及其部曲，便落於「黃牛」之手。</p>
<p>金圓券該放棄了，今天應該宣布用銀幣。兩年以來，作者一向主張用銀幣，今天更證明此外別無可行之路。但人們總有幾種疑懼而作者卻以為是多餘的。</p>
<p>第一，人們當然要問財政怎樣辦：我認為很簡單，士兵每人每月發六元的餉，如果照實有人數發，不過一千多萬元足夠了。文武官吏，留十元的基數，十元以上，一律發十分之一，比之戰前，相差太多了，比現況好的多，不會有怨言，也不過二三千萬元吧。再加上辦公費，那末每月有五六千萬元足夠應付了。這點錢，今天該是有辦法的。稅收一律收銀元，二千多萬應該收得到，而收數是逐漸加多的。等到稅收增加之後，一切從新調整。</p>
<p>第二，人們當然要問，銀幣不夠用，怎樣辦，這種不足有兩面，一方是財政上的不足，國家存銀，用以彌補財政赤字，究竟能維持多久；一方是經濟上的不足，社會籌碼例底是不是夠用。就前者而說，六個月應無問題，如果用庫存黃金易銀，或鑄重一兩的金幣，每枚合銀元百元，二年以內的財政赤字，應無問題。關於後者，民間現存銀元，尙有相當量的輔幣券，再按六成準備，發相當銀元券，勉可敷用。同時再向美國商洽白銀借款，將來用農產和鑛產去還，增鑄銀幣，籌碼是夠用的，何況幣值穩定之後，呆存的現金，都入銀行，信用貨幣增多，實有硬幣的用途減少，籌碼不會太缺的。</p>
<p>第三，更有人担心白銀被套走的問題，這更不足慮，經濟上有來有往，今天用貨物套銀元，明天用銀元套貨物，來往大致相等的，怕什麼？</p>
<p>作者以為今日的問題，惟有用銀幣，才能在經濟上打出一綫生機，人心大定之後，經濟的發展和繁榮，才可以實現。要金銀在人民手上轉，要金銀盡了真正「通貨」的責任，要人民不但活得下去，而且活得很好，真正的財富增加，人民和國家的消費增加，政府自然成為舉國擁護的強力政府，而一切問題都容易解決了。</p>
<p>今天的經濟危機，是恐懼紙幣的心理造成的，惟有放出硬幣可救！是放手的時候了。</p>

<h3>制憲議會批準憲草　西德設雛型政府　為德國統一政府樹立基礎</h3>
<p>〔路透社西德波恩城六日電〕德國政治家已於今日在此設立西德之雛型政府，西德制憲議會今日決定設立一臨時委員會，以執行聯邦政府成立前之政府任務。該案前動議人自由民主黨領袖薛費，謂該過渡委員會之目的，在收集並研究資料，以準備統一的立法，同時並草具設立各政府部門之法令，俾聯邦政府成立後即可立時展開工作。</p>
<p>〔聯合社德國波恩六日電〕制憲議會今二讀通過西德政府憲章，僅共黨議員兩名投反對票。憲草將於作日舉行三讀，其中有兩條特別富於與味：（一）要求將西柏林併入西德，此議早由美英法軍政府總督表示反對；（三）規定取消西德罪犯之死刑，此乃共黨所贊成之唯一條文。此外，西德首都所在將於八日會議中決定之，西德共和國成立蜞暫定七月十五日。</p>
<p>〔合眾社波恩六日電〕德制憲議會今日選出一十八人之執行委員會暫為政府，此一西德政府將在盟國監督下行政，正式之政府將在七月下旬舉行普選後正式成立。盟國方面已準備將德境佔領區移交文官管制，對德國之行政將儘少過問。西德臨時政府係自議員中選出共七名，計社會黨一人，基督民主黨一人，自由民主黨二人，及其他各黨各一人。據柏林方面透露，西方盟國軍事長官業已賦權予西德政府，一俟該政府正式成立後將可設立聯邦警察隊。西德領袖於四強同意解除柏林封鎖及舉行四強外長會議之際，倉卒成立憲法及決定成立政府，蓋德人希望若西方盟國與蘇聯獲致協定，則德國統一政府可能以波恩憲法為基礎。</p>

<h3>大量貨品待遇　柏林重趨活躍</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社法蘭克福六日電〕德國雙佔區當局已採取一切必要措置，以恢復至柏林之交通，但軍政府對此尙未發出正式指令。大量之新鮮食物目下已經貯備，以運往柏林，所運之數量將視蘇軍當局撥予雙佔區當局之火車數量而定。在反封鎖解除後不久，蘇方之採購代表團即可抵此。雙佔區與蘇軍區之貿易協定，亦將重行實施，但因幣制之不同，故將作若干調整。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林七日電〕柏林之封鎖雖經四強宣布將於十二日正式解除，但東西隔絕已十幾月的柏林市，今已開始重新趨於活躍。東柏林警察昨宣布準許西柏林居民往東區店舖購買食品後，西區主婦今日蜂擁入東區，不惜出高價購買。又悉東德與西德之官員已在擬具貿易貨品單，以使於貿易封鎖解除後，即使東西間之貿易趨於正常。</p>

<h3>英國工黨</h3>
<p>— 勃萊斯福著　宋桂煌譯</p>
<p>工黨的中心目的，便是阻礙人產的發展而遏抑其自尊心的關於地位與機會的不平等—即階級，性，及膚色的不平等——的取消。以正面字樣言之，這便是說，工黨的睥，實在於建設一種理想社會，需求我們能在其中抱定一個共同的目標，羣策羣力，以促其實現，並在一切日常生活中均以此為指歸。特殊階級能夠利用土地及機器私有為其經濟力量，以操縱平民而加以剝削榨取的制度一日不餘，則上述這種理想即一日不能實現。</p>
<p>在實際上，工黨以用實現這種無階級之分的社會的方法有二：其一，便是近代富庶國家的尋常努力即使人人都能享受適當的最低的生活水凖，即使人人的工資都能維持生活，人人都有住宅，都能享受藝術及自然界的美，都能有健康保障，不致失業，有養老金，尤要者須使貧民的子女與少數富人的子女，享有受到合理教養的平等機會。欲達此目的，必須苛征捐稅，使各人的收入能夠近於平等，必須由下層逐漸以壓力，非特權階級必須組織起來。不過在我個人看來，此事之實現，必須賴乎我們的政敵能夠懷有公道心及正義感，以接受我們的籲請。誰都知道，事實上，在以上五十年中，自由黨與保守堂對於工黨壓力的反應，有時是喜悅的，有時是怨詛的。民主便是以這樣的方法發揮其作用。</p>
<p>工黨所遭遇的第二個問題，便是關於權力的基本問題。這種欲使人人能享受較高的最低限度的生活水凖英勇努力，如徒賴乎征收捐稅及分發福利品，決不能達成目的。「各取所需」僅是社會主義理想的一半，另一半則為「各盡所能。」易言之，我們必須以心理學為助，計劃生產事業，以使全民能夠產生最高底的生產量，無論為手工工人，抑為經理及技師，均須一致努力。但是在工業方面，廠主們往往限制生產，提高貨價，並以使一部分人民失業為手段，以便威嚇工人，以為如此便可更加盈利。如果仍使最後發言權操之於這班廠主手中，那末，大量生產的計劃，還能實現嗎？運用外力加以控制，雖屬可能之事，但是這種辦法往往使人不願與無大成效。社會主義者的手段，便是使生產工具為工人所共有，以工業之推進，係為公共謀福利，而非為私人謀利潤。我們果然依照這個辦法進行，那末，便能使全體人民羣策羣力，而實現社會協調，自尊，共同生產的榮譽，及更高的生產量嗎？工黨的這種政策，最適用於主要工業及壟斷性的產業。但是，它並不以國有政策為目的。蓋國有政策不過是一種手段，而其目的之所在，則為日常生活中的民主及由全民共同勞力而生產的財富—精神的及物質的——的平等分享。具體言之，我們能在普丁敦農場及南威爾斯煤礦中實現這種無階級之分的社會嗎？</p>
<p>最後，社會主義實是一種國際性的信條，以全體人類的福利為目的。社會主義者欲以此種主義服務於全人類，無論為非洲屬地上的土人，抑為本國的同胞，均一視同仁，不分畛域。印度的獨立，是我們所樂於贊助之事。我們並將以此主義為原則，制訂一個適宜的世界政府綱領，以期賴以實現世界和而預防世界大戰的再度發生。（完）</p>

<h3>參會小組委會決議六項　廢止公用指數另訂計算辦法　工業大用戶先付百分之三十　其他暫照上期計薪指數付款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會公用委員會於昨日下午四時，在該會大禮堂召開大會，商討如何抑制本市公用事業價格之不合理狂漲，出席副議長徐寄廎，參議員朱扶九，張中原，江浩然，李文杰，徐永祚，瞿鈛，馬君碩，童襄，何元明等五十餘人，公用局代理局長顧震白，及各公用事業公司負責人十餘人列席，會議由公用小組召集人姜豪主席，首由顧代局長說明公用事業計價指數編製方法，略稱：本市公用事業，前以幣值貶值落過速，按職工生活指數計費，收支差額過鉅，無法維持，特重擬以原定基數按物價指數計費辦法，經參議會公用委員會四月廿三日決議，酌情試辦一月，上項計價指數，原以中央銀行所編本市躉售物價指數為凖，詎試行不久，央行停編物價指數，遂失依據，不得已選取有關公用事業成本之主要因素，（一）中白粳，（二）結匯證，（三）中些油，（四）基隆煤四種，根據聯合徵信所逐日物價紀錄及主管機關公布之牌價，將上開四項因素，分別求出與央行物價指數之比率藉以推算物價指數。</p>
<p>各界發言情緒激昂</p>
<p>繼由各參議員分別代表工業會，市商會，醫院等各機構發表意見，一致認為公用事業與全市大眾休戚相關，無疑地應為市民服務，而際此百業凋敝，市面極端不景氣之目前，本市公用事業公司意欲獨利其身，擅自擬訂計價指數，採取最高物價四種，米·煤·柴油·外匯移轉證為計數因素，求取暴利，而市公用局不但不能負起監督之責，反而處處幫助各公司說話，實使各界覺得感慨萬端。昨日發言者情緒均甚激昂，對各公司及公用局當局攻擊不遺餘力。參議員李文杰稱：公用事業價格狂漲，漫無止境，事實上各業已無法負擔，本會在四月二十三日以極沉痛之情緒，接受此項辦法，目的在於維持公用事業，當時並有二點保留：（一）試行一個月或半個月。（二）基數儘量減低。後以央行之物價指數停編，另行採取計價指數，遂致造成嚴重錯誤，應立即予以抵制，以計薪指數作為計算之根據。嚴諤聲稱：計薪指數乃發薪之標準，亦為成本之一，建議公用事業計價指數，百分之四十應以生活指數為根據，百分之六十應以物價指數為根據。王子建稱：（一）公用事業計價之基數頗有問題，如電價基數係按三月一日之標準，而其他物價均以八一九物價作為基體，其中相差半個月，造成脫節現象。（二）央行每月有巨額貸款（六十萬美金）貸與各公司，以資彌補，每半月轉期一次，則各用戶有權請求按照半個月之前之舊價付款。范守淵稱：本人代表本市公私之醫院呼籲，並舉實例：（一）中山醫院本月電費高達卅億餘元，已超過該院之全部收入。（二）同濟醫院規模甚小，僅有五十床位，本月份煤氣賬總數達十億餘元，該院每個月之全部收入，僅足支付半個月之煤氣費。如此，則除非當局下令全市民不準生病，否則醫院絕無辦法繼續維持。</p>
<p>六項決議</p>
<p>會議至七時半始散，議決六點如下：（一）公用局所採用物價指數計算辦法內所列物品種類過活，應予停止使用，另行規定物品種類訂定計算辦法。（二）請市政府即行組織審議委員會商討基數及收款指數。（三）在新計算辦法未訂定前，凡未付款之用戶，於本月十四日之前，工業大用戶先付百分之三十，其他用戶按照上期職工計薪指數先行付款，待新辦法訂定後再行結算，採多退少補辦法。（四）請政府對於公用事業所需燃料儘量減低價格，並請央行放寬公用事業貸款驚訝，尤其對於公用事業放款及經辦燃煤物料不應以圖利為目的。（五）請央行對於工商業舉辦水電借款，以免工商業因不能負擔水電費而致停頓。（六）公用事業審議委員會由本會推定姜豪，江浩然，李文杰，朱扶九，費樹聲，瞿鈛等代表參加，對於其他單位及人數，請市府酌定聘任。</p>

<h3>計算職工薪資　辦法明可公布　五十元底薪者折發銀元十元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局頃草擬一項「非常時期上海職工薪資計算辦法」，此項辦法須經警部政務委員會議通過後，明日可望公布，原草案辦法內容如次：</p>
<p>查本市職工向依職工生活費指數為計薪標準，時至今日，顯已不能適應實際，茲為安定職工生活，兼顧勞資雙方需要計，特規定職工計薪辦法如左：</p>
<p>一，取銷以職工生活費指數計薪辦法，自五月份起職工薪資照八一九後底薪計算標準，其等級如下：（一）五十元以下者百分之二址（五十元底薪者折合銀元十元）。（二）五十一元至一百元者超過部份百分之十（一百元底薪得折合銀元十五元）。（三）一百零一元以上者超過部份百分之五（二百元底薪者折合銀元二十元）。</p>
<p>二，政府舉辦職工特種配合米，專備各廠商價購（或由各廠商自行採購），按照職工人數，以發給每一職工一斗米為基凖（現行重點配給米照舊），在職工應得工資內抵扣。</p>
<p>三，職工應得工資，除特種配給為應扣低抵外，其超過部份，由雇主按照當日銀元價格，折發鈔券，或其他實物或逕發銀元。</p>
<p>四，發薪日期，仍按各廠習慣辦理，所有預支辦法一律取消。</p>
<p>昨據社會局曹局長稱：此項辦法僅係穩定職工之薪金工資，至各工廠商店原在之各種津貼，獎金，米貼等均仍舊存在，不得藉口取消，亦得按照以上辦法折合銀元計算。</p>

<h3>銀行女職員服安眠藥死　楊雅言身世堪憐　內幕復雜待偵查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四明銀行總行稽核處女職員楊雅言，於本月三日服鉅量安眠藥片，在林森中路康綏公寓三〇一號自殺，經發覺送往廣慈醫院急救，終告不治，於六日晚八時香殞玉消。</p>

<p>楊平日為人開朗活潑，識者無不愛其天真，而亦無不憐其遭遇。入四明服務以來，先後已達三載，辦事認真能幹，亦為該行仝人所欽佩。此次陡告變故，該行同人無不痛悼。聞楊之死，內情極為曲折。楊於去年，邂逅前浙江省銀行上海分行經理樓啓鈞。此次楊服毒之康綏公寓，即為樓之寓所。事出以後，警局即傳訊樓某，聞樓表示，該屋因欠楊黃金四大條，無法償還，已頂賣與楊。但一般人認為事當並不如此簡單，詳情正由盧家灣區警局長張毓中親自偵查中。</p>

<h3>食米上挺　油價昨見回挫</h3>
<p>米市逐日上漲，由於到貨稀少，供應不暢所致。米店實銷雖不多，但售戶更少，價終上挺。北市場白粳薄稻羊秈已高達三千萬，各張三百萬元。南市場白粳薄稻各漲三百二十萬，糙秈開出尙多，高貨價一午六百四十萬。</p>

<p>棉布盤旋，微波盪漾，華南各埠如寗波，臺灣方面布價較昂，尤以廈門客商添辦甚殷。四君子嗶嘰及龍頭細布去化頗暢，四君子嗶嘰最高喊過二一二五萬，最低二千萬。龍頭細布接受極夥，大概以二〇七五萬成交居多，中檔細布如五福，喇叭童，及龍頭B細布，喊價在一七五〇萬，與上日市價相仿，紡建公司循例開售棉布，惟無人申請配售，民營廠盤站穩，缺乏變動。</p>
<h3>桐油沉寂</h3>
<p>桐油昨市，賣買雙方趦起，交易疲莫能興，過程岑寂無聲，各檔行情均仍盤旋原途。據業內人云：目前國內外俱乏去化，趨勢暫無明朗之象。</p>

<h3>美國民主黨縱橫談　（中）</h3>
<p>— 宋桂煌譯</p>
<p>（三）傑克遜否決了修改「聯邦銀行」憲章的企圖，表現了他的政治的作風。他說：「富有而強有力者時常強迫政府依照他們的自私自利的目的行事，這是大可惋惜之事。當法律足使富者愈富，而強有力者愈強有力，則社會中的平民，如農民·匠工·勞動者等，皆既無時間又無資具，以使立法利於他們自己者，故他們誰都有權利出而申訴他們的政府的不義。」</p>
<p>上述這些話，益以傑克遜的英雄般的人格及大無畏的領袖精神，因而民主的信仰復行活躍，為自哲斐孫時代以來所未有。所謂「民主黨」這個名稱，即在這個時期內所確立。農民·匠工·和勞動者突然地覺得他們終於有了一個深深地關心他們的利益的總統。著作家與知識分子，如霍爽·惠特曼·古柏·布賴安特·班克洛夫·伊爾文等，都一致擁護傑克遜所標榜的「人人權利平等，任何人無特權」的準則。此外，傑克遜的政黨又發動了新的工會運動。</p>
<p>另一方面，工商界人士，則大多數均對傑克遜抱仇視態度，其仇視之深，除對佛蘭克林·D·羅斯福外，為對其他任何總統所未有。保守派的輝格黨，則斥傑克遜為階級對立的製造者兼獨裁家。他們的領袖克萊甚至在參院的地板上哭喊道：「我們現在是陷在革命之中了，過去的革命向來是不流血的，現在却在迅速地將政府的純粹民主性質全部改變了，並且一切權力將集中於一人之手了。」</p>
<p>繼傑克遜任總統的凡鮑倫，曾經企圖進行他的民主十字軍，但是這時蓄奴問題正開始支配着政治，以致把其餘一切事項差不多都排除了。一八四八年，有許多傑克遜派分子加入自由土地黨，因而使得傑克遜的老黨安穩地放在蓄奴者的手中。南方人士因為堅持蓄奴制度，便拋棄了哲斐孫的遺產。不久，南方派便公開斥責哲斐孫所說「凡人生而平等」的信仰。南方派的首領卡爾渾說道：「再沒有什麽話比這更加荒誕無稽了。」</p>
<p>誠如伊利諾州的一個政治家所說，至一八五九年，這襲自哲斐孫的傳統的黨，却不再提起他的名字了，而原孫襲自哲斐孫的反對派的傳統的新共和黨，却竊取他的外衣加在自己身上了。林肯以一種獨特的方法，無精打彩地說得真妙，說道令人想起披着大衣的兩個醉漢打架。打了許久之後，兩人的大衣却弄得互相調換了。「若謂今日的這兩大黨，真正便是哲斐孫與亞當斯當時的兩黨，那末，這兩黨便和那兩個醉漢相同，是吃喝了同一桌的酒食的。」</p>
<p>一八六〇年的大選，又使民主黨益趨分裂。極端親南方的分子，以背叛的態度走入了查理斯吞黨員代表大會中。有一個北方的代表籲請與會大衆保持統一。有一個密士失必州的代表起立發言道：「我們是為主義而奮鬥的。該死的黨。」於是全國遂相應分裂而走上了黑暗的戰爭之途。</p>
<p>自哲斐孫以至布卡南，只有兩屆的政府是非民主黨的。但是阿坡馬托克斯一役之後，便促成了一個明主黨式微的時期。蓋自此次戰役後，凡屬愛國與正直之事，殆為共和黨所專有，而民主黨在國人面前，則為叛徒與壞蛋所結成之團體。他們表現了沮喪，混亂，墮落，乃於戰後企圖改組，惟既無理論基礎，又無領袖人物。</p>
<p>格蘭特當政期內，醜聲四播，繼又發生一八七三年的大混亂，終使共和黨受了嚴重打擊，致一蹶不可復振。民主黨遂乘機而起，公推紐約州長替爾頓為候選人，蓋替氏先曾在紐約市擊減推得幫團。替氏原是一個保守姓的公司法律顧問，以勇敢及忠誠著名，因而在選區中頗具勢力，共和黨的候選人海伊斯雖精明幹練，竟亦不是他的敵手。但是雙方勢均力敵，甚鮮軒輊。當人民投票之際，替爾頓顯然得了大多數，這一部分是因為有許多南方的黑人（大多數是共和黨）的投票權被剝奪了之故。但是後來復選時，情勢却起了變化；而海伊斯終因一個為共和黨所控制的選舉團而獲得了大多數。誠如一個在場的學生所說，起初是民主黨竊奪了選舉事務，繼而又為共和黨所奪回。</p>
<p>民主黨接受了選舉團的決定，而與共和黨成立了一個默契。這個默契是：海伊斯如果當選總統，便將聯邦軍隊南方撤退。這意味着，南方的共和黨將告消滅，黑人將被剝奪選舉權，而南方將成為民主黨的安全領土。結果便是鞏固的南方的建立。</p>
<p>在這些年代中，正是政治上的平庸時代，而民主黨亦並不略勝於共和黨。八十年代中的艱苦時代在經濟制度上顯示了種種重大的缺點，在西部農業地區及各新與都市中的陰慘的貧民窟中，又暴露了人民的大大不滿。民主黨對於人民的不滿始終漠不關心，而仍只願提出候選人和政綱，而實則民主共和兩黨了無差別，不過一丘之貉而已。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>直至一八八六年克利夫蘭出，民主黨中才有了一個領袖人物。此人率直敦厚，不尚權謀，先後任布法羅市長及紐約州長，均有重大興革，政績卓著。即因了他的剛直，他乃得了中立派的所謂超然共和黨的擁護，於一八八四年的大選中擊敗了白蘭英。他在第一任將終之際，曾經裁決稅率為過高。政客們力勸他待大選後再行提出減低稅率，但克利夫蘭却不予採納。他後來寫道：「我不願只圖再度當選，而不求人民及早了解我對於稅率問題的立場。……從黨的立場看來，我也許是犯了錯誤；但是這我可不管，我只知道這是對的。我至少是以此為滿意。」</p>
<p>但是克利夫蘭與公忠體國的超然派共和黨員，實則無甚差別。威爾遜有一次曾經說道：「你們也許以為克利夫蘭的政府是民主黨的。實則不然。克利夫蘭乃是一個保守性的共和黨分子。」他的保守主義在他的第二任中，表現得非常明白。他於一八八八年競選，一部分因了稅率問題而告失敗，但至一八九二年又復當選。他因了四年的試行公司法，便無疑地表現了更加忠心於資本家。例如他的檢察長便常避免利用沙爾曼反托辣斯法案以防害托辣斯，却利用這法案於一八九四年鐵路罷工中以破壞勞工利益。</p>
<p>但是向來被忽略的騷動的浪濤險惡地澎湃起來了。經過了三十年的騷動，西部人民已經相信，只有實行通貨膨脹，才能使這一方面的一切問題獲得解決。政治的活動隨麥價的跌落而增加，而九十年代將結束之際物價的崩潰，乃使農民們團結成「農民同盟。」可怕的赤貧，爬進了大草原之上。有一個女演說家對其鄰人大叫道：「你們農民們所需做的，是少種糧轂而多設地獄！」</p>

<h3>郵資調整超過戰前標準　籲請減低以輕人民負担</h3>
<p>編輯先生：在眼前各種物價不合理的畸形上漲之下，共引起人民公憤的，除公用事業外，要算「郵資」了。查郵政為國營事業，非營利機關可比，每次加價，應當顧及民生，且須立法院通過，以示鄭重。詎此次加價，非唯未經合法程序；且加價倍數之高，超過以往任何時期記錄，平信竟需十六萬元，快信要八十萬元，航空快信更要百萬元以上，豈非駭人聽聞！固然交部取消貼補政策而今郵政自行維持，但加價究應採取合理標準，方使譽論翕服，乃此番加價如此之高，不顧人民負担，社會寗不譁然？</p>
<h3>緊急呼籲</h3>
<p>為善最樂助產更佳</p>
<p>本報讀者助產金，貧苦產婦申請者日必數起，而近來捐款甚少，勢將停頓。特向各界讀者作緊急呼籲，萬望慷慨解囊，共襄義舉，不勝企禱之至！</p>
<p>縱以戰前郵資而言，平信亦僅四分，今日平信十六萬元，想郵政當局必以銀元四百萬一塊計算，四分正合十六萬元，意即恢復戰前標準，似極顯明。殊不知銀元價值，較戰前超過與黃金比值兩倍以上，食米比值一倍左右，即戰前銀元百元方可換黃金一兩，而今日僅需三十餘元；食米一石戰前需銀元十元，而今日僅值五元左右。可見現今銀元價值，實屬不合理的人為現象。按今日平信一封，實際等於戰前八分以上。竊意連年戰爭，人民生活水準已降低不知若干倍，而郵資負担却高出戰前標準一倍至兩倍以上，事之不合理，未有甚於此者矣！</p>
<p>鄙人為貴報廿餘年忠實讀者，素稔貴報主持正義，用特函達，敬祈刊於讀者來函欄內，並乞共同主張郵資減低，以輕人民負担，無任感盼！祗頌撰祺。</p>
<p>讀者冷靜仁拜啓</p>

<h3>Taiyuan City Suffers an Unprecedented Calamity, Military and Civilian Deaths Reach Over 40,000 When the Communist Army Captured It, Wang Jingguo, Sun Chu, and Others Are Captured</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 7th] According to Mr. Zhang Kehan, the magistrate of Yangqu County who just escaped from Taiyuan, Taiyuan was captured by the bandits on April 24. After Xu Xiangqian's troops suffered over 70,000 casualties, they first broke into the Dabeimen at 8 AM that morning. The defending troops resisted house by house, and the fighting stopped at 2 PM. The deaths of military and civilians in the city reached over 40,000, with corpses piled up and blood and flesh blurred. Almost all the houses in the city have collapsed. The bandit army posted announcements, but it was impossible to find a complete wall. Liang Dunhou, the provincial party committee member, committed suicide on the same day. Wang Jingguo, Sun Chu, and General Dai Bingnan were captured. When they boarded the car at Shouyi Gate to go to the Yuci concentration camp, they were severely beaten by the bandit army. Wang's left forehead was hit very hard, and blood flowed like a stream. The four regiments of Dai Bingnan's 30th Army withdrew to the Hushan area east of the city on April 24 and broke through to the east, possibly joining forces with Li Zhenqing's 40th Army in Xinxiang. Mr. Zhang, together with County Magistrate Zhang of Pingding County, disguised themselves and escaped on April 27. They were subjected to inspections as many as 27 times between Taiyuan and Yuci. It is said that after this great calamity in Taiyuan, it may take up to 20 years to restore its former appearance.</p>
<h3>Mawei Decides to Establish a Fortress Command</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Fuzhou, 7th] The Mawei Fortress Command will be established immediately. Commander Lin Lusheng has been ordered to come to Fuzhou to prepare everything.</p>
<h3>The "Yongding" and "Yongxiu" Ships, Break Through to Xiamen, A Glorious Page in the History of Heroism</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 7th] The navy's "Yongding" and "Yongxiu" ships, which participated in the Yangtze River Defense War, broke through under Communist fire after Nanjing, Jiangyin, and other places fell and have now arrived in Xiamen. According to "Yongding" Captain Liu Dekai and "Yongxiu" Captain Gui Zongyan, the two ships were originally ordered to defend the Yangtze River and protect key areas along the river such as Anqing and Wuhu, inflicting heavy blows on the Communist army. When the Communist army crossed the river, they were ordered to retreat. At that time, there were more than ten warships along the river, but they were distributed in various sections and not concentrated. The "Yongding" ship departed from Anqing on April 22, leading the ships eastward. Under the intense artillery fire from both sides of the Yangtze River, they resisted bravely and finally broke through, arriving in Shanghai on the 24th. The ship's body was damaged in many places by artillery fire, but fortunately, the vital parts were not hit. The officers and soldiers of each ship suffered heavy casualties. Their heroic spirit can be called a glorious page in the history of the Chinese Navy. Because Shanghai was close to the war zone and the ship's body needed to be repaired, they sailed to Xiamen for repair and reorganization.</p>
<h3>The Morale in Suiyuan is Extremely High, Talk of Local Peace is Absurd</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 7th] A person from Suiyuan said: The morale on the front line in Suiyuan is extremely high. The rumors of local peace are absurd. Chairman Dong Qiwu and all the generals have repeatedly expressed their determination to fight the Communist bandits to the end. Since the National Army in Beiping was reorganized by the Communist Party, over 9,000 officers who escaped to Gui Sui have arrived, and the soldiers have not been counted. This group of officers and soldiers, having learned the lesson of being deceived by local peace in Beiping, are particularly determined to fight.</p>
<h3>Fang Zhi and Representatives from All Sectors in Shanghai, Console the Garrison and Distribute Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] The Consolation Committee of this city has been very active in its consolation work recently. Yesterday, the committee launched its third expanded consolation effort, dividing into four teams to visit the garrisons stationed in Chongming, Jiangwan, Gaoqiao, and Xuhui. Fang Zhi, the chairman of the committee, and representatives from all sectors of society led students from various universities and performance groups to depart at 9 AM. In addition to giving motivational speeches to the garrisons, they also distributed consolation silver dollars on the spot. The garrison in Xuhui had just transferred from the front line to Shanghai. After Chairman Fang personally went to give a speech, the soldiers were particularly excited and spontaneously shouted slogans such as "Defend Greater Shanghai." The committee also noted that there were other garrison troops whose consolation money had not been distributed, and they are continuing to find ways to distribute it soon.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Warns the Philippines, Prevent the Infiltration of the Fifth Column</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 6th Special Dispatch] The Manila Bulletin, run by American businessmen, recently warned the Philippines to be wary of Soviet forces, disguised as the Chinese Communist Party, which would be extremely dangerous for the Philippines. The newspaper commented on Chennault's statement that if the Communist Party conquers China, it will eventually cause the entire loss of Asia, saying that any country that adheres to democracy should not ignore the situation in China, especially the Philippines. The Philippines cannot act like an ostrich and bury its head in the sand. If there is indeed a Soviet conspiracy and force in China, then the Philippines must be vigilant. The Soviet plan will not stop in China but will extend to other Eastern countries, but what it adopts is not force but the fifth column of infiltration.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi Talks to American Reporters, The National Army Can Still Hope to Win, The Fate of All of Asia Rests on China</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] Dr. Hu Shi met with a United Press reporter at his residence here today and analyzed the situation in China. The reporter asked what he thought of Chennault's statement that one million dollars a day could save China. Hu replied: I am not a military expert and am not qualified to judge this estimate. Material assistance is certainly needed. He also said: "In my view, the position of our country today is not worse than that of France and Belgium when they were invaded by the German army during the last World War. Both countries were trampled by the enemy and were in a precarious situation, but the people did not lose courage because they believed that the Allies could support them and that the Germans would eventually be driven out. I believe that the National Government's position has not been lost, and we can still win." The reporter asked Hu whether he believed that the Chinese Communist Party was directly colluding with Moscow. Hu replied: "Of course!" and showed a copy of the Chinese Communist Party's program, proving that the Chinese Communist Party's line is consistent with Moscow. Hu concluded: "The fate of all of Asia rests on the Chinese Civil War. If China is occupied, the rest of East Asia will fall under Soviet control."</p>
<h3>The Han Nationality Cultural Promotion Association of Xinjiang Province Grandly Opens in Dihua, Will Discuss Various Plans in Response to the Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 7th] The Han Nationality Cultural Promotion Association, representing 220,000 Han people in the entire province, recently convened a representative conference of branch associations from ten counties. The grand opening was held in Di at 10 AM on the 6th. Seventy-one Han representatives from sixteen counties north of Kuqa arrived. The scheduled meeting period is five days.

<h3>US Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Starts Investigating China Policy, Bullitt Suggests Sending Wedemeyer and Chennault to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee began preparations on the 6th to formally investigate US policy toward China.</p>
<p>Republican Senator Bridges said that the committee had intelligence that the White House had prevented the Army from proposing to transport captured German weapons and ammunition to the Chinese National Government after the European war.</p>
<p>The investigation of China policy was prepared by Bridges and Subcommittee Chairman McClellan, with Secretary of State Acheson sitting in front of them on the witness stand. Bridges and McClellan asked several questions, asking Acheson to answer them at a later date.</p>
<p>Bridges asked Assistant Secretary of State Butterworth to provide the names of the personnel who served in the State Department's Far East Division since 1930 and the personnel who handled relations with Germany since 1943. He specifically pointed out Su Weisi and Davis, requesting to know their past records.</p>
<p>McClellan requested to obtain the records of Butterwass, director of the State Department's Far East Division, and his predecessor, Vincent (currently the US ambassador to Switzerland).</p>
<p>Bridges told reporters that he requested the Appropriations Subcommittee to investigate China policy because everyone else was avoiding it. He had to invite officials in the State Department who were familiar with the development of China policy to express their views, and then invite Acheson to ask how he would act in the future. He also wanted to know the truth about the dismantling of German factory machinery and would try to obtain records of whether the investigating officials were loyal to the country, but did not expect the government to publish these records.</p>
<p>McClellan asked whether the State Department's proposal to allocate funds to establish an embassy in South Korea was a mistake, because "if the Communist Party occupies China, it will soon annex Japan and South Korea."</p>
<p>Butterworth replied that although the currency had inflated slightly, the country had not been occupied by the Communist Party, "I believe that if the American flag flies at the embassy, it will help encourage resistance."</p>
<p>Bridges asked Acheson to provide a list of State Department officials who handled Chinese and German affairs since 1930, "so we can know who is responsible for the tragedy in China and the foolish behavior in Germany."</p>
<p>Regarding the Army Department's proposal to transport German weapons to China, Acheson said he did not know the details. Bridges then asked Acheson to investigate and then explain whether a White House assistant official named Locke withdrew the order to transport weapons to China when some German weapons were already on their way to China. Acheson agreed to provide information to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee.</p>
<p>Bridges also told Butterworth that he would ask questions later about the State Department's "removal of personnel whose loyalty to the country is questionable." The "most cunning" members of the Communist Party will never join organizations that are listed as destructive.</p>
<p>Butterworth said that as far as he knew, there were no Communist Party members in the State Department, but "the people who worry me, you and I do not know." He was "quite pleased" with the current situation and believed that there was no need for the State Department or Congress to worry.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Republican Congressman Jackson demanded a quick vote on a bill to investigate American Far East policy on the 6th. The case was proposed by Jackson and Senator Nolan. According to Jackson, the Rules Committee is paying close attention to it, but it must first be passed by the Rules Committee before it can be submitted to the House for discussion. The case advocates that a committee composed of five members each from the Senate and the House conduct a detailed investigation of American Far East policy and authorize the committee to decide where to meet and draft recommendations for future American policy. However, it has not been decided whether the committee can meet in the Far East.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Former Ambassador Bullitt urged President Truman on the 6th to send Generals Wedemeyer and Chennault to China to help organize the National Government to resist the Communist Party. However, Bullitt believes that unless pressure is applied to the government with sentiment, there is little hope that the United States will act in time.</p>
<p>Bullitt met with United Press reporters and advocated using American silver to strengthen the National Government's economy and military funds. Bullitt strongly advocated that action should be taken quickly, saying, "President Truman should immediately send a first-class combat general, preferably Wedemeyer, to China to provide advice on strategy, tactics, logistics, service, training, and all other aspects of resistance. At the same time, we should hand over all the large number of surplus aircraft we have in Japan and Okinawa to Chennault to form an effective air force."</p>
<h3>An Employee of an American Mining Company Accuses the US of Sucking Away Our Silver</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Siers, an employee of Newmont Mining Company, accused the United States on the 7th of "steadily sucking away" China's silver, leading to the progress of communism in China. Siers stated in the Senate Subcommittee that he supported the bill that would allow newly mined and refined gold to be traded freely in the United States. He said, "Much of the despair and misfortune in China occurred because we took away the silver they considered to be money. No wonder they became Communists."</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] The Daily Mail, a British Conservative Party newspaper, carried an editorial on the morning of the 7th, saying that Britain's outpost in the Far East is now in danger of becoming another Berlin. The British government should make a practical declaration to defend Hong Kong at any cost. There are now vague assurances that Britain intends to maintain its position, but this is not enough.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 8th] When asked on the 7th how Australia would assist Britain in handling the situation in Hong Kong, Australian Minister of Defense Taitman replied that Australia would first observe the development of the situation in Hong Kong and then issue a statement or take action related to the area.

<h3>Weekly Forum: The Dead End and Hope of the Economy</h3>
<p>— Ma Daying</p>
<p>The banknote shortage is attacking every city, and the crazy rise of silver dollars is causing all commerce to stop; the economy is striding towards a dead end. Everyone's survival is under serious threat. Is this the beginning of a total social collapse? Or is it the arrival of the end of the world?</p>
<p>Such a precarious economic crisis is worse than political and military changes. If there is no way to deal with it, everything will be over. However, the problem is very simple: a loss of confidence in the Gold Yuan coupon and a lack of trust in any government policy. However, this is not the biggest and real crisis. The real crisis lies in the ruling class's lack of courage to face and admit the facts, lack of wisdom to change course, and especially hateful is their clinging to real interests and unwillingness to let go, having the air of "I would rather ruin the world than harm a hair of mine." Only then have we had today's difficulties, creating today's intractable stalemate.</p>
<p>Today, there are solutions, but the most difficult thing is that the financial authorities are creating all kinds of excuses, unwilling for the country to have a solution. This is by no means slander. The common people cannot be deceived, and since we reformed the currency system last August, there have been financial or economic reform plans of various kinds, but they have always been focused on deceiving the people with paper money. They have never been willing to have real reforms. The common people have seen enough and don't want to see anymore. The value of the Gold Yuan coupon has repeatedly declined, and no one really wants it anymore. Therefore, no matter how fast the printing press turns and how much the banknotes increase, their overall total value drops sharply. This is the inevitable result of "governing the world by deception." Is this really irreparable?</p>
<p>For the benefit of a few wealthy families and a certain faction, the national economy is not worth considering, and the people's livelihood is not worth caring about. This is the real problem, and the real reason why China has become what it is today. Issuing banknotes is a weapon for wealthy families to suck blood, and the national economy is heading for a dead end. Why should they feel sorry for it?</p>
<p>After inflation, there is no effective way other than using hard currency. In fact, today's China is already a silver coin world, and prices expressed in silver coins are quite stable. However, we do not recognize this fact, nor are we willing to seek reform on this ready-made basis. The gold and silver thrown out falls into the hands of wealthy families and their factions, or into the hands of "scalpers."</p>
<p>The Gold Yuan coupon should be abandoned. Today, it should be announced that silver coins will be used. For two years, the author has always advocated the use of silver coins. Today, it is even more proven that there is no other feasible way. However, people always have several fears, which the author believes are unnecessary.</p>
<p>First, people will certainly ask what to do with the finances: I think it's very simple. Each soldier receives a salary of six yuan per month. If it is actually paid according to the number of people, a little over ten million yuan is enough. Civil and military officials retain a base of ten yuan, and those above ten yuan receive one-tenth, which is much less than before the war, but much better than the current situation. There will be no complaints, and it will only be twenty or thirty million yuan. Adding office expenses, then fifty or sixty million yuan per month is enough to cope. This amount of money should be available today. Taxes should be collected in silver dollars, and more than twenty million should be received, and the amount received will gradually increase. After the tax revenue increases, everything will be adjusted from scratch.</p>
<p>Second, people will certainly ask, what if there are not enough silver coins? This shortage has two sides. One side is the financial shortage. How long can the national silver reserves be used to make up for the financial deficit? The other side is the economic shortage. Are there enough social chips at the bottom? In the former case, there should be no problem for six months. If gold in storage is exchanged for silver, or gold coins weighing one tael are minted, each worth 100 silver dollars, there should be no problem for the financial deficit within two years. Regarding the latter, there is still a considerable amount of auxiliary coin coupons in the hands of the people. If a considerable amount of silver dollar coupons are issued with a 60% reserve, it can barely be used. At the same time, negotiate a silver loan with the United States, which will be repaid with agricultural and mineral products in the future, and more silver coins will be minted. There are enough chips. Moreover, after the currency value is stabilized, idle cash will enter the bank, the use of credit currency will increase, and the use of hard currency will decrease. There will not be too much shortage of chips.</p>
<p>Third, some people are even more worried about the problem of silver being smuggled out. This is even less of a concern. There are comings and goings in the economy. Today, goods are exchanged for silver dollars, and tomorrow, silver dollars are exchanged for goods. The comings and goings are roughly equal. What is there to be afraid of?</p>
<p>The author believes that today's problem can only be solved by using silver coins to create a line of hope in the economy. After the people's hearts are settled, economic development and prosperity can be realized. Gold and silver must circulate in the hands of the people, gold and silver must fulfill their true responsibility of "currency," and the people must not only be able to survive, but also live well. Real wealth must increase, and the consumption of the people and the country must increase. The government will naturally become a strong government supported by the whole country, and all problems will be easily solved.</p>
<p>Today's economic crisis is caused by the fear of paper money. Only by releasing hard currency can it be saved! It's time to let go.</p>

<h3>Constituent Assembly Approves Draft Constitution, West Germany Sets Up Prototype Government, Establishing a Foundation for a Unified German Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bonn, West Germany, 6th] German politicians today established a prototype government in West Germany. The West German Constituent Assembly today decided to establish an interim committee to carry out government tasks before the establishment of the Federal Government. The proposer of the motion, Free Democratic Party leader Schäfer, said that the purpose of the transitional committee is to collect and study data to prepare for unified legislation, and to draft laws for the establishment of various government departments, so that the Federal Government can start work immediately after its establishment.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bonn, Germany, 6th] The Constituent Assembly today passed the West German Government Charter on second reading, with only two Communist Party members voting against it. The draft constitution will be read for the third time tomorrow, with two particularly interesting provisions: (1) requesting that West Berlin be incorporated into West Germany, a proposal that had previously been opposed by the American, British, and French military governors; (3) stipulating the abolition of the death penalty for West German criminals, which is the only provision supported by the Communist Party. In addition, the location of the West German capital will be decided at the meeting on the 8th, and the establishment of the West German Republic is tentatively scheduled for July 15th.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Bonn, 6th] The German Constituent Assembly today elected an 18-member executive committee to serve as a temporary government. This West German government will administer under the supervision of the Allies. The formal government will be formally established after a general election held in late July. The Allies are prepared to transfer the occupied areas of Germany to civilian control and will intervene as little as possible in German administration. The West German interim government is elected from the parliamentarians, with a total of seven members, including one from the Socialist Party, one from the Christian Democratic Party, two from the Free Democratic Party, and one from each of the other parties. According to sources in Berlin, the Western Allied military leaders have empowered the West German government, and once the government is formally established, it will be able to establish a federal police force. West German leaders hastily established a constitution and decided to establish a government when the four powers agreed to lift the Berlin blockade and hold a four-power foreign ministers' meeting, because the Germans hope that if the Western Allies and the Soviet Union reach an agreement, the unified German government may be based on the Bonn Constitution.</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of Goods Receive Favorable Treatment, Berlin Becomes Active Again</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 6th] The authorities of the German double occupation zone have taken all necessary measures to restore traffic to Berlin, but the military government has not yet issued a formal directive. A large quantity of fresh food is currently being stored to be transported to Berlin. The quantity transported will depend on the number of trains that the Soviet military authorities allocate to the double occupation zone authorities. Soon after the anti-blockade is lifted, purchasing delegations from the Soviet side will arrive here. The trade agreement between the double occupation zone and the Soviet military zone will also be re-implemented, but some adjustments will be made due to the different currency systems.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] Although the four powers have announced that the Berlin blockade will be formally lifted on the 12th, the city of Berlin, which has been isolated from the East and West for more than ten months, has begun to become active again today. After the East Berlin police announced yesterday that they would allow West Berlin residents to go to East Berlin shops to buy food, West Berlin housewives flocked to East Berlin today, willing to pay high prices to buy. It is also reported that officials from East and West Germany are drafting a list of trade goods to ensure that trade between the East and West will return to normal even after the trade blockade is lifted.</p>

<h3>Jessup to Fly to Paris Tomorrow to Prepare for Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting, Soviet Union to Make Three Concessions on the German Issue</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] American sources here said today that US representative Jessup, who presided over the US-Soviet talks, will fly to Paris from Washington on the 9th to prepare for the four foreign ministers' meeting to be held here on May 23rd.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] German newspapers registered with the US zone authorities reported that three concessions would be made: (1) establishing a federal republic, with the Soviet Union not specifically stipulating the date of establishment; (2) the Soviet Union will, under any circumstances, try to unify the German currency system so that the Soviet zone economy can be revived; (3) even if the four-power talks fail, the Soviet Union is still prepared to completely withdraw from East Germany. The newspaper also said that Soviet military government officials only regard the lifting of the blockade as a technical matter for the transportation department. The Soviet Union has begun preparing materials for the Paris four-power conference so that the Soviet Union can regain the initiative and promote its plan for German unification and a fair peace in Paris.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] Diplomatic circles here predicted on the eve of the four foreign ministers' meeting that the result of the foreign ministers' meeting, if it can establish a unified democratic German federation, which is subject to strict Allied control until a peace treaty is signed, and stipulates the date for signing the peace treaty, would be the "greatest success." If the result of the meeting is only to agree to establish two different but cooperative political systems in Germany, it would only be a "half success." They are not overly optimistic about the four foreign ministers holding a meeting, but they are quite satisfied because they believe that this meeting can allow the four countries to have contact and help improve the situation. French officials said about the duration of the meeting, "All countries have agreed in principle to end around June 15th so that the discussion will not be delayed for too long."</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] It is revealed here that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will increase foreign language broadcasting programs starting this summer, intensifying the propaganda war between East and West.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 6th] Tito replied to many questions raised by US reporter Smith today, saying: "Yugoslavia is determined to maintain its independence." Tito's reply was unanimously published in all Yugoslav newspapers today. He refused to answer the first six questions raised by Smith. The content of these six questions has not been announced. The seventh question was, "Are the people of Yugoslavia determined to maintain their independence and territorial integrity?" The answer was, "The people of Yugoslavia have made many sacrifices to maintain their independence, unity, and friendship." The eighth question was, "What attitude will the people of the People's Republic of Macedonia (one of the Yugoslav federations) take in the face of any external attacks that attempt to separate this republic from other states?" Tito replied: "The people of the Republic of Macedonia never intend to separate from other republics of Yugoslavia, because they have obtained everything they need within the Yugoslav Federal Republic, that is, absolute equality of rights and equal opportunities for development." The ninth question was, "Does Tito welcome Stalin's recent statement that he is willing to reach a reconciliation with the United States?" Tito said: "Our most sincere hope is that the United States and the Soviet Union can reach a peaceful agreement to resolve all disputes." Smith is the person who recently asked Stalin for his opinion on the Dushi talks. It is also reported that Smith's questions to Tito, the first six of which were all about the recently formed "Free Greek Democratic Government," were not answered by Tito. The six questions were as follows: (1) "What attitude does the Yugoslav government take towards this government?" (2) "What do you think of the participation of non-Greek elements in this government?" (3) "In your opinion, who took the initiative to organize this government?" (4) "Do you believe that the organization of this new government is intended to interfere in the internal affairs of countries other than Greece?" (5) "Do you believe that this government can benefit the Greek people?" (6) "Do you believe that this government is willing to seek the peace and security of the Balkans?"</p>

<h3>"The Blue Bird" Author, Maeterlinck, Dies</h3>

<h3>The British Labour Party</h3>
<p>— By Brailsford, Translated by Song Guihuang</p>
<p>The central aim of the Labour Party is to eliminate the inequality of status and opportunity – that is, the inequality of class, gender, and color – that hinders the development of human potential and suppresses self-esteem. In positive terms, this means that the Labour Party's vision lies in building an ideal society in which we can all embrace a common goal, working together to achieve it and taking it as a guide in all daily life. This ideal cannot be realized as long as a particular class can use private ownership of land and machines as its economic power to manipulate, exploit, and extract wealth from ordinary people.</p>
<p>In practice, the Labour Party has two methods of realizing this classless society. The first is the ordinary effort of modern wealthy countries to ensure that everyone can enjoy an appropriate minimum standard of living, that everyone's wages can sustain life, that everyone has housing, that everyone can enjoy the beauty of art and nature, that everyone has health security, is not unemployed, and has pensions. In particular, the children of the poor should have equal opportunities to receive a reasonable education as the children of the few rich. To achieve this, it is necessary to impose harsh taxes so that everyone's income can be close to equal. Pressure must be gradually applied from the bottom, and non-privileged classes must organize. However, in my personal opinion, the realization of this matter must rely on our political opponents having a sense of fairness and justice to accept our appeal. Everyone knows that, in fact, in the past fifty years, the reactions of the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party to the Labour Party's pressure have sometimes been joyful and sometimes been resentful. This is how democracy works.</p>
<p>The second problem the Labour Party encounters is the basic issue of power. This heroic effort to enable everyone to enjoy a higher minimum standard of living cannot be achieved by simply collecting taxes and distributing welfare. "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" is only one half of the socialist ideal. The other half is "From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution." In other words, we must use psychology to assist in planning production enterprises so that the whole people can produce the highest output, whether they are manual workers or managers and technicians, they must work together. However, in industry, factory owners often limit production, raise prices, and use the unemployment of a part of the people as a means to threaten workers in order to make more profit. If the final say is still in the hands of these factory owners, can the plan for mass production still be realized? It is possible to control it by using external force, but this method often makes people unwilling and not very effective. The socialist means is to make the means of production owned by the workers, so that the promotion of industry is for the public welfare, not for private profit. If we proceed according to this method, then can we enable the entire people to work together to realize social coordination, self-esteem, the honor of joint production, and higher output? The Labour Party's policy is most suitable for major industries and monopolistic industries. However, it does not take nationalization as its goal. Nationalization is just a means, and the purpose of which is democracy in daily life and the equal sharing of wealth – spiritual and material – produced by the common labor of the whole people. Specifically, can we realize this classless society in the Purton Farm and the South Wales coal mines?</p>
<p>Finally, socialism is an international creed, aimed at the welfare of all mankind. Socialists want to serve all mankind with this doctrine, whether they are natives on the African colonies or their compatriots, they are treated equally, regardless of territorial boundaries. We are happy to support the independence of India. We will also use this doctrine as a principle to formulate a suitable program for a world government, in order to rely on it to realize world peace and prevent the recurrence of world wars.

<h3>Participating Committee Resolves Six Items: Abolish Public Utility Index and Formulate New Calculation Method, Large Industrial Users Pay 30% First, Others Temporarily Pay According to the Last Salary Index</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Public Utility Committee of the City Council held a general meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday in the Great Hall of the Council to discuss how to suppress the unreasonable surge in the prices of public utilities in the city. Deputy Speaker Xu Jilu, Councilors Zhu Fuju, Zhang Zhongyuan, Jiang Haoran, Li Wenjie, Xu Yongzuo, Qu Qian, Ma Junshuo, Tong Xiang, He Yuanming, and over fifty others attended. Acting Director Gu Zhenbai of the Public Utility Bureau and over ten persons in charge of various public utility companies were present as observers. The meeting was chaired by Jiang Hao, convener of the Public Utility Group. First, Acting Director Gu explained the method of compiling the pricing index for public utilities, stating briefly: In the past, public utilities in the city used the employee living index for billing due to the excessive devaluation of currency. The difference between revenue and expenditure was too large to maintain. Therefore, a method of calculating fees based on the original base number according to the price index was re-drafted. The Public Utility Committee of the City Council resolved on April 23 to conduct a one-month trial at its discretion. The above-mentioned pricing index originally used the wholesale price index compiled by the Central Bank of this city as the standard. Unexpectedly, the Central Bank stopped compiling the price index shortly after the trial, thus losing its basis. Therefore, it was necessary to select the main factors related to the cost of public utilities: (1) Zhongbai Japonica rice, (2) Exchange settlement certificate, (3) Zhongxie oil, (4) Keelung coal, and calculate the ratio of the above four factors to the Central Bank's price index based on the daily price records of the Joint Credit Investigation Agency and the prices announced by the competent authorities to estimate the price index.</p>
<p>Opinions Are Voiced Vigorously from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>Then, the councilors spoke separately on behalf of various institutions such as the Industry Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and hospitals. They unanimously believed that public utilities are closely related to the general public of the city and should undoubtedly serve the citizens. However, at a time when all industries are declining and the market is extremely depressed, the public utility companies in this city intend to benefit themselves alone, arbitrarily formulate a pricing index, adopt the four highest prices of rice, coal, diesel, and foreign exchange transfer certificates as counting factors to seek huge profits. The Municipal Public Utility Bureau not only fails to fulfill its supervisory responsibilities but also helps the companies speak everywhere, which makes all walks of life feel extremely emotional. Those who spoke yesterday were very emotional, and they spared no effort to attack the companies and the Public Utility Bureau authorities. Councilor Li Wenjie said: The prices of public utilities are soaring endlessly. In fact, all industries are unable to bear them. This council accepted this method with extremely heavy emotions on April 23, with the aim of maintaining public utilities. At that time, there were two reservations: (1) A trial period of one month or half a month. (2) The base number should be reduced as much as possible. Later, the Central Bank stopped compiling the price index, and another pricing index was adopted, which led to serious errors and should be resisted immediately, using the salary index as the basis for calculation. Yan E said: The salary index is the standard for salary payment and is also one of the costs. It is recommended that 40% of the public utility pricing index should be based on the cost of living index, and 60% should be based on the price index. Wang Zijian said: (1) There is a problem with the base number for public utility pricing. For example, the base number for electricity prices is based on the standard of March 1, while other prices are based on the August 19 price as the base, with a difference of half a month, causing a disconnect. (2) The Central Bank provides huge loans (US$600,000) to the companies every month to compensate. Since the term is rolled over every half month, users have the right to request payment according to the old price of half a month ago. Fan Shouyuan said: I represent the public and private hospitals in this city and appeal and give examples: (1) The electricity bill for Zhongshan Hospital this month is as high as over 3 billion yuan, which exceeds the hospital's total income. (2) Tongji Hospital is small, with only 50 beds, and the total gas bill for this month is over 1 billion yuan. The hospital's total monthly income is only enough to pay for half a month of gas. In this case, unless the authorities order all citizens not to get sick, the hospital will have no way to continue to operate.</p>
<p>Six Resolutions</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM and resolved the following six points: (1) The types of goods listed in the calculation method of the price index adopted by the Public Utility Bureau are excessive and should be stopped, and other types of goods should be stipulated and a calculation method should be formulated. (2) Please ask the municipal government to immediately organize a review committee to discuss the base number and collection index. (3) Before the new calculation method is formulated, all users who have not paid, large industrial users should pay 30% first before the 14th of this month, and other users should pay according to the salary index of employees in the last period first. After the new method is formulated, the settlement will be made, adopting the method of refunding more and compensating less. (4) Please ask the government to reduce the prices of fuel required for public utilities as much as possible, and please ask the Central Bank to relax the loan surprise for public utilities, especially for public utility loans and the handling of coal materials, which should not be for the purpose of seeking profits. (5) Please ask the Central Bank to grant water and electricity loans for industrial and commercial enterprises to avoid the shutdown of industrial and commercial enterprises due to their inability to pay water and electricity bills. (6) The Public Utility Review Committee will be represented by this council appointing Jiang Hao, Jiang Haoran, Li Wenjie, Zhu Fuju, Fei Shusheng, and Qu Qian. For other units and numbers of people, please ask the municipal government to determine the appointment.</p>
<h3>Communists Send a Large Number of Spies to Specialize in Purchasing Silver Dollars and Gold, Stores Only Accept and Do Not Release, Strict Investigation Will Be Conducted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The police bureau has repeatedly received confidential reports recently, saying that in order to undermine Shanghai's economy and promote the rapid collapse of industry and commerce, the Communist Party has sent a large number of economic spies to Shanghai to secretly set up institutions specializing in purchasing silver dollars and gold, raising prices to disrupt the market, so the police bureau has sent personnel to investigate secretly.</p>
<p>It is also learned that some silver dollar exchange shops in the city only accept and do not release. The police bureau is concerned that this may be related to the case and is sending officers to investigate thoroughly. If found, they will be severely punished according to martial law.</p>
<h3>Public and Education Owe Oil and Coal, Mayor Cables to Request Advance Appropriation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The central government owes the city's public and education personnel rations of cooking oil and coal balls.

<h3>Chief of Criminal Division of the Police Bureau Deeply Hopes That the Broadsword Gang Will Awaken</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since Xu Shouhuai (Little Changgen), the leader of the Broadsword Gang, was arrested by the police bureau and presented to the garrison headquarters for execution by firing squad, the Broadsword Gang has somewhat disappeared. According to Criminal Division Chief Zheng Tingxian's statement: After this bureau executed Xu Shouhuai, the leader of the Broadsword Gang, this time, it is deeply hoped that all members of the Broadsword Gang can immediately awaken, reform themselves, engage in legitimate occupations, and abide by their duties. Then the authorities will uphold leniency and not pursue them. If they still run rampant and refuse to disappear, the authorities will mobilize all police officers to arrest them and handle them strictly according to law, in order to protect the city's public security.</p>
<h3>Method for Calculating Employee Salaries Can Be Announced Tomorrow, Those with a Base Salary of 50 Yuan Will Have 10 Silver Dollars Converted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau has recently drafted a "Shanghai Employee Salary Calculation Method During Extraordinary Times." This method must be passed by the Police Department's Political Affairs Committee before it can be announced tomorrow. The contents of the original draft method are as follows:</p>
<p>It has been found that employee salaries in this city have been based on the employee cost of living index. To this day, it is clear that it can no longer adapt to reality. In order to stabilize the lives of employees and take into account the needs of both labor and capital, the following employee salary calculation methods are specifically stipulated:</p>
<p>1.  The method of calculating salaries based on the employee cost of living index is abolished. Starting in May, employee salaries will be calculated according to the base salary standard after August 19. The grades are as follows: (1) 20% for those below 50 yuan (those with a base salary of 50 yuan will have 10 silver dollars converted). (2) 10% for those between 51 yuan and 100 yuan (those with a base salary of 100 yuan will have 15 silver dollars converted). (3) 5% for those above 101 yuan (those with a base salary of 200 yuan will have 20 silver dollars converted).</p>
<p>2.  The government will hold special employee coordination rice, specially prepared for various manufacturers to purchase at a price (or purchased by the manufacturers themselves), according to the number of employees, based on issuing one dou of rice to each employee (the current key ration rice remains the same), which will be deducted from the employee's wages.</p>
<p>3.  The employee's wages, except for the special ration that should be deducted, the excess part will be converted into banknotes or other goods or directly issued in silver dollars by the employer according to the price of silver dollars on that day.</p>
<p>4.  The date of salary payment will still be handled according to the habits of each factory. All advance payment methods will be cancelled.</p>
<p>According to Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, this method is only to stabilize the salaries and wages of employees. All kinds of allowances, bonuses, rice subsidies, etc. that originally existed in various factories and stores still exist, and cannot be cancelled under the pretext.

<h3>Female Bank Clerk Dies from Taking Sleeping Pills, Yang Yayan's Life is Pitiful, Complex Inside Story Awaits Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Yayan, a female clerk in the audit department of the Siming Bank's head office, took a large number of sleeping pills on the 3rd of this month and committed suicide at No. 301 Kang Sui Apartment, Lin Sen Middle Road. She was discovered and sent to Guangci Hospital for emergency treatment, but she eventually died, and the incense and jade disappeared at 8:00 PM on the 6th.</p>
<p>Yang was from Cixi, Zhejiang, and was 26 years old. During the Anti-Japanese War, she married Chen Xinian from Zhenhai in Chongqing. The relationship was harmonious after the marriage, and they had two sons. After the victory, Yang immediately went to Shanghai with her husband, who then flew to Chongqing again to settle his business in Chongqing. In the spring of 1946, he took a plane back to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the plane crashed midway, and the passengers were killed, including Chen.</p>
<p>Yang was usually cheerful and lively, and everyone who knew her loved her innocence and pitied her situation. Since joining Siming, she has reached three years, and her serious and capable work has also been admired by her colleagues in the bank. The colleagues in the bank were all saddened by the sudden change. It is said that Yang's death has a very tortuous inside story. Last year, Yang met Lou Qijun, the former manager of the Shanghai branch of the Zhejiang Provincial Bank. The Kang Sui Apartment where Yang took poison was Lou's residence. After the incident, the police bureau immediately summoned Lou. Lou reportedly said that the house owed Yang four large bars of gold, which could not be repaid, and had been sold to Yang as collateral. However, most people think that the matter is not that simple. The details are being personally investigated by Zhang Yuzhong, the chief of the Lujiawan District Police Bureau.</p>

<p>Upholding Road Property and Increasing Revenue: Railway Bureau Employees Form Vigilante Squad</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] Employees of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, considering that these are extraordinary times and that road materials, coal, machine parts, and other road property are crucial to the railway's lifeline, are deeply concerned that petty thieves may take the opportunity to steal, affecting train operation.

Han Liangcai was elected as the leader, with Peng Fenggang, Qiu Jishi, He Jingshu, Zhong Wenjiang, Qian Xu, Li Liwan, and Li Hurenb appointed as deputy leaders. The vigilantes are composed of male and female employees from the entire railway, who take shifts to patrol day and night. Employee participation is exceptionally enthusiastic, reportedly reaching around 1,000 people. The squad was first piloted at the North Main Station and has gradually been extended to the West Station, Baoshan Station, Wusong Station, Rihui Station, Zhanghuabang Station, and other locations. It has been quite effective in maintaining station order, cracking down on ticketless passengers, eliminating scalpers and black-market tickets, increasing railway revenue, and protecting road property.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollars: Ostensibly Stable, Covertly Firm</h3>

Some commercial firms were posting 4 million, only buying and not selling.</p>
<h3>Disrupting Finances, Forming Gangs for Robbery: Ten Criminals Executed by Firing Squad in Two Locations in One Day—Outside the Fish Market and in Front of the British and French Concession Boundary Tower</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The police bureau recently learned that a large number of illegal criminals were acting as "silver bulls," differentiating prices for "big head," "boat dollars," and "eagle dragon" dollars to disrupt finances and shake public confidence, which is in violation of martial law and silver dollar exchange regulations. After dispatching personnel for close investigation, on the 13th of last month, Shao Ziyu (28 years old, from Shandong), Li Bu'an (37 years old, from Huai'an), Wang Fenglai (28 years old, from Huai'an), Wang Bingzhen (30 years old, from Jiangbei), Zhang Jishan (32 years old, from Anhui), and five others were arrested at No. 41 Ningguo Road, No. 522 Hengfeng Public Housing on Dinghai Road, and a thatched shed without a number on Dongchang Road. They confessed to being instructed by the Communist Party to buy and sell various versions of silver dollars at differential prices to disrupt finances. Furthermore, it was found that the criminals had formed gangs and committed numerous armed robberies, including the larger cases of robbing No. 6 Xiyudeli on Dongchang Road, Pudong on February 2nd this year, robbing No. 7, Lane 223, Temporary Qing Road on March 6th, robbing No. 1192 Changyang Road on April 9th, and robbing No. 22 Zhoujiapai Road on April 12th. Five guns and 39 rounds of ammunition used in the crimes were also seized. After reporting to the garrison command for approval, they were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in front of the gate of the Jiangpu Road Fish Market at 3:00 PM yesterday by Gan Jue, the Chief of the Detective Section, and Song Anmin, the Chief of the Economic Section, to serve as a stern warning.</p>
<p>In addition, at 10:00 AM yesterday, the bureau executed five notorious robbers and spies—Guo Guisheng (25 years old, from Hunan), Zhou Zigen (23 years old, from Pudong), Mao Honggen (23 years old, from Nanhui), Yang Xigen (26 years old, from Pudong), and Cao Long (23 years old, from Nanhui)—in front of the Chen Ying's Memorial Tower in Laoximen.

<p>[Central News Agency] The spokesman for the Political Affairs Committee of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Command stated: At today's (7th) meeting, the Political Affairs Committee resolved the following matters related to the issuance of notes by various exchange banks in the city: (1) Following the previous meeting's resolution that, apart from the Central Bank's issuance of fixed-amount notes, other banks and treasuries should not follow suit, it has been reported that various exchange banks are still issuing cashier's checks on the market. These checks are a form of varied exchange bank notes and should be prohibited from circulation in accordance with previous orders. Otherwise, they will be prosecuted for disrupting finances. The Financial Administration Bureau is instructed to be responsible for inspecting and suppressing these checks and reporting the results for review and approval. (2) Apart from the fixed-amount notes issued by the Central Bank, all exchange bank notes issued in the past must be recalled within three days, starting from the 5th of this month.

<h3>Rice Smuggling Case in Mailbags Committed by Temporary Laborers</h3>
<p>Regarding the "Rice hidden in mailbags for smuggling" incident that occurred at the North Station, as reported by a certain newspaper in the city yesterday, relevant sources stated that the post office hires temporary laborers to load and unload mail along the route due to a shortage of manpower. These laborers receive a monthly subsidy of one shi of rice and are issued uniforms for work convenience, but are not official post office employees. The incident of rice hidden in mailbags did indeed occur yesterday, totaling seven bags. Two bags were sacks, three bags were hemp bags, one bag was a flour bag, and one bag was a travel bag, but they were not loaded in the mail car. Therefore, Guo Xinggang, the post office director on duty for the train, and his assistant, Lu Mutao, were unaware of the matter beforehand, proving that it was entirely the work of the laborers. The report involving Tao Fengzhu, the mail car escort for the post office, is a misunderstanding, as Tao is currently a receiving clerk in the dispatching section of the post office. The post office has begun a thorough investigation into the case to clarify the truth.</p>

<h3>Gold Shows Slight Firmness: National Bank's Selling Ultimately Suppressed Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, gold trading was sparse, and the market trend was slightly firm.

Those absorbing at low prices were quite firm. The off-exchange opening price was 200 million, 230 million, once reaching 210 million, 240 million. In the middle of the session, the Central Bank resumed selling, entrusting Dadecheng Gold Firm to supply as much as possible at a price of 220 million. However, due to the extremely scarce appetite of large investors and a lack of inquiries, only three major bars were sold, and sentiment turned soft, retreating all the way to 160 million, 190 million. In the afternoon, it rose to 220 million, 240 million, slightly up 10 million from the previous day.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Rise: Oil Prices Decline Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rice prices are rising daily due to scarce arrivals and poor supply. Although actual sales at rice shops are not high, there are even fewer sellers, so prices are ultimately rising. At the North Market, white japonica rice, thin indica rice, and Xiang rice have reached as high as 30 million, each ticket worth 3 million. At the South Market, white japonica and thin indica rice each rose by 3.2 million. There is still a large quantity of coarse Xiang rice available, with high-quality goods priced at 16.4 million in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Grains: Transactions are dull due to weak supply and demand, so trading is sparse, and prices rarely rise or fall. Soybeans are stable, corn is slightly up by 500,000. Bengbu red sorghum is quoted at 7 million. Only a few sesame seeds and peanuts are available, and prices are flat.</p>
<p>Flour: The market trend is fluctuating, with prices rising and then falling. The future market for various commodities is generally showing declines, and the underlying situation is still soft.

<h3>Money Market Turns Loose: Cotton Yarn Rises Across the Board</h3>

<h3>A Broad Discussion of the American Democratic Party (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Song Guihuang</p>
<p>(III) Jackson’s veto of the attempt to revise the charter of the "Federal Bank" demonstrated his political style. He said: "It is regrettable that the rich and powerful often force the government to act according to their selfish and self-interested purposes. When the laws make the rich richer and the powerful more powerful, the common people in society, such as farmers, artisans, and laborers, have neither the time nor the resources to make legislation beneficial to themselves, so they all have the right to come forward and appeal the injustices of their government."</p>
<p>The above words, coupled with Jackson's heroic personality and fearless leadership spirit, revived the democratic faith, something unseen since the era of Jefferson. The name "Democratic Party" was established during this period. Farmers, artisans, and laborers suddenly felt that they finally had a president who deeply cared about their interests. Writers and intellectuals, such as Hawthorne, Whitman, Cooper, Bryant, Bancroft, Irving, etc., all unanimously supported Jackson's principle of "equal rights for all, no privileges for anyone." In addition, Jackson's party also launched a new labor union movement.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most people in the industrial and commercial sectors held a hostile attitude towards Jackson, a depth of hostility unmatched towards any other president except for Franklin D. Roosevelt. The conservative Whig Party denounced Jackson as a creator of class antagonism and a dictator. Their leader, Clay, even cried on the Senate floor: "We are now trapped in a revolution. Past revolutions have been bloodless, but now it is rapidly changing the pure democratic nature of the government, and all power will be concentrated in the hands of one person."</p>
<p>Van Buren, who succeeded Jackson as president, attempted to carry out his democratic crusade, but at this time the issue of slavery began to dominate politics, almost excluding all other matters. In 1848, many Jacksonian members joined the Free Soil Party, thus securely placing Jackson's old party in the hands of slaveholders. Southern people abandoned Jefferson's legacy because of their insistence on the slavery system. Soon, the Southern faction openly denounced Jefferson's belief that "all men are created equal." The leader of the Southern faction, Calhoun, said: "Nothing could be more absurd."</p>
<p>As a politician from Illinois said, by 1859, the party that inherited the tradition from Jefferson no longer mentioned his name, while the new Republican Party, which originally inherited the tradition of opposition to Jefferson, stole his cloak and put it on themselves. Lincoln, in a unique way, listlessly put it wonderfully, saying something reminiscent of two drunk men fighting while wearing coats. After fighting for a long time, the two men's coats were accidentally swapped. "If the two major parties today are truly the two parties of Jefferson and Adams back then, then these two parties are the same as those two drunk men, eating and drinking from the same table."</p>
<p>The election of 1860 further divided the Democratic Party. Extreme pro-Southern elements entered the Charleston Party Convention in a rebellious manner. A Northern representative appealed to the attendees to maintain unity. A representative from Mississippi stood up and said: "We are fighting for principles. Damn the party." As a result, the nation split accordingly and embarked on a dark path of war.</p>
<p>From Jefferson to Buchanan, only two administrations were not Democratic. However, the Battle of Appomattox ushered in a period of decline for the Democratic Party. After this battle, anything related to patriotism and integrity was almost exclusively possessed by the Republican Party, while in the eyes of the people, the Democratic Party was a group formed by traitors and villains. They showed frustration, confusion, and corruption, and attempted to reorganize after the war, but they had neither a theoretical foundation nor leaders.</p>
<p>During Grant's administration, scandals spread everywhere, followed by the great turmoil of 1873, which severely hit the Republican Party, causing it to collapse beyond recovery. The Democratic Party seized the opportunity and publicly nominated the Governor of New York, Tilden, as their candidate. Tilden had previously reduced the Tweed Ring in New York City. Tilden was a conservative company legal advisor, known for his courage and loyalty, and thus had great influence in the constituency. The Republican candidate, Hayes, although intelligent and capable, was no match for him. However, the two sides were evenly matched. When the people voted, Tilden clearly won a majority, partly because many Southern black people (mostly Republicans) were disenfranchised. However, the situation changed during the later recount; and Hayes finally obtained a majority through an electoral college controlled by the Republican Party. As one student present said, the Democratic Party initially stole the election affairs, and then the Republican Party stole it back.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party accepted the decision of the Electoral College and reached a tacit agreement with the Republican Party. The agreement was: If Hayes was elected president, he would withdraw federal troops from the South. This meant that the Republican Party in the South would be eliminated, black people would be disenfranchised, and the South would become a safe territory for the Democratic Party. The result was the establishment of a consolidated South.</p>
<p>During these years, it was an era of political mediocrity, and the Democratic Party was no better than the Republican Party. The difficult times in the 1880s revealed major shortcomings in the economic system, and the grim slums in the western agricultural areas and various new cities exposed the great dissatisfaction of the people. The Democratic Party remained indifferent to the people's dissatisfaction, and only wanted to nominate candidates and platforms. In fact, there was no difference between the Democratic and Republican parties; they were just two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>It was not until Cleveland emerged in 1886 that the Democratic Party had a leader. This person was straightforward, honest, and unpretentious. He successively served as the Mayor of Buffalo and the Governor of New York, and had made significant reforms and outstanding political achievements. Because of his integrity, he won the support of the neutral "Mugwump" Republicans and defeated Blaine in the election of 1884. Near the end of his first term, he ruled that the tax rate was too high. Politicians urged him to propose lowering the tax rate after the election, but Cleveland refused. He later wrote: "I do not want to seek re-election simply without letting the people understand my position on the tax rate issue as early as possible... From the party's standpoint, I may have made a mistake; but I don't care about that. I only know that this is the right thing to do. At least I am satisfied with this."</p>
<p>However, Cleveland was not much different from the patriotic Mugwump Republicans. Wilson once said: "You may think that Cleveland's government is Democratic. But it is not. Cleveland is a conservative Republican." His conservatism was clearly demonstrated in his second term. He ran for election in 1888 and failed partly because of the tax rate issue, but was re-elected in 1892. He undoubtedly showed more loyalty to capitalists because of four years of trying out corporate law. For example, his attorney general often avoided using the Sherman Antitrust Act to prevent trusts, but used this act in the 1894 railway strike to undermine labor interests.</p>
<p>However, the turbulent waves that had been ignored were surging dangerously. After thirty years of turbulence, the people in the West had become convinced that only by implementing inflation could all problems in this area be solved. Political activity increased as wheat prices fell, and the collapse of prices at the end of the 1890s united farmers into the "Farmers' Alliance." Terrible poverty crept across the prairies. One female speaker shouted to her neighbors: "What you farmers need to do is plant less grain and build more hells!"</p>

<h3>Postal Rate Adjustment Exceeds Pre-War Standards, Appeal for Reduction to Lighten People's Burden</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Among the unreasonably high prices of various commodities at present, what has aroused public outrage besides public utilities is "postal rates." As the post office is a state-run enterprise and not a profit-making institution, each price increase should take into account the people's livelihood and must be approved by the Legislative Yuan to show solemnity. However, this price increase was not only without legal procedure; but the increase multiplier was higher than any previous record. Ordinary letters actually cost 160,000 yuan, express letters cost 800,000 yuan, and air express letters cost more than one million yuan! Is this not shocking! It is true that the Ministry of Communications has cancelled the subsidy policy and now the post office maintains itself, but the price increase should adopt reasonable standards so that reputations are well-regarded. However, this price increase is so high, regardless of the people's burden. How can society not be in an uproar?</p>
<h3>Urgent Appeal</h3>
<p>It is best to do good and better to assist childbirth.</p>
<p>The number of poor pregnant women applying for the midwifery fund from our newspaper readers is increasing daily, but recent donations are very few, which will cause it to stop. We hereby make an urgent appeal to readers from all walks of life, hoping that you will generously donate to support this righteous cause. Your great expectation is highly appreciated!</p>
<p>Even with pre-war postal rates, ordinary letters were only four cents. Today, ordinary letters are 160,000 yuan. It is thought that the postal authorities must calculate silver dollars at 4 million yuan a piece. Four cents is exactly 160,000 yuan, which means restoring the pre-war standard, which seems very obvious. However, the value of silver dollars is more than twice the pre-war exchange rate with gold and about one times with rice. That is, before the war, 100 silver dollars could be exchanged for one tael of gold, while today it only takes more than 30 yuan; one stone of rice before the war cost 10 silver dollars, while today it is only worth about 5 yuan. It can be seen that the current value of silver dollars is an unreasonable artificial phenomenon. According to today, a letter is actually equivalent to more than eight cents before the war. I think that the people's living standards have been reduced many times due to years of war, while the postal burden is one to two times higher than the pre-war standard. Nothing is more unreasonable than this!</p>
<p>I am a loyal reader of your newspaper for more than 20 years. Knowing that your newspaper upholds justice, I specially write to you, respectfully requesting that it be published in the Readers' Letters column, and also asking you to jointly advocate a reduction in postal rates to lighten the people's burden. I am deeply grateful! I wish you all the best.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Reader Leng Jingren</p>
<p>(Note: Since the postal rate was adjusted from 1,500 yuan for ordinary letters to 40,000 yuan, and then adjusted to 160,000 yuan, this column has received more than 30 letters from readers. Due to space constraints, we have only selected and published one letter from Mr. Leng, an old reader of our newspaper for more than 20 years, as a brief note. We deeply apologize to the remaining readers who submitted letters!)</p>
