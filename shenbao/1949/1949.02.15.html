<h3>發放東北救濟金竟發生綁刦鉅案　莫行惠離滬赴台前　被刦二千萬元　案情曲折離奇駭人聽聞劉哲提請監院澈查彈劾</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕莫德惠於赴台前在滬被人以「綁票」方式，卻去二千萬元一事，業經十四日由自滬抵京之監院副院長劉哲證實。劉氏且爲此事，與何濟屬·陳璃山等監委聯名提出議案，提交十五日舉行之該院院會討輸。據劉氏稱：莫氏六日在滬發放東北救濟金六千萬元，均為央行二萬元一張之本票，迄午夜，僅有數百人領到，未領到者實問發放人負，並在彼等身上搜出本票四五百張，發放人員四人遂被送往警備司令部；至七日，有自稱「立委馮雲」之男子，在黃浦警局督察長室請見莫氏，以手槍威脅莫氏，強索央行二千萬元支票一紙，並迫莫陪同兌現後始去。此事殊屬離奇，劉氏已決定除提出院會外，並將報告李代總統。劉氏向監院所提請派員調查東北物資淸理委會放款舞弊及暴徒劫款并該委會以外人員假藉名義，發放非東北難民鉅款案，內稱：「竊查東北物調局在津滬所存物資甚多，哲前與莫柳忱先生上書總統，請撥出一部份救濟東北京滬台穗渝公教人員及難民，經總統蔣批交政院會議議決等因。近聞有人利用淸查東北物資委會名義，竟將物資以低價售出，不採用拍賣手續，擬定每名東北難民發給兩千兀，國代·立監委每戶發給兩萬元，總共發出七八千萬元，其餘物資尚擬繼續變價，所值不下四五億元，並聞每位經手人員動用款項甚多，以致激動公憤，羣情洶洶，該淸查會又以六千萬元送請黃浦警局重行發放，乃竟有人於夜半刦匿三千餘萬元，聞已捕獲三名。又有以手槍威逼莫先生劫去兩千萬元，形同綁票，光天化日之下，竟有此等現象，離奇之至，以致眞正東北難民反而領不到手·又聞莫先生赴台次日，又有非東北非淸查會之某人，又發放非東北難民共一億元，不知是何居心，敬請大會推舉委員澈查，正式彈劾，以儆貧頑」。</p>

<p>我們集合各省市參議會及全國性職業團體文化團體和婦女團體各代表，自本年二月十二日起，在上海開會三天，商討促進全國和平的辦法。大家站在人民的立塲，以沉重的心情，作嚴肅的討論，通過了二大要求七項主張的促進和平意見書，業已專案發表，並決定組織經常機構，根據大會的決議，繼續推進和平運動，蔪求全國同胞的熱烈支持，不達停戰弭兵的目的，決不中止。現在謹於大會閉會之際撮述我們的信念，敬告吾全國同胞</p>
<p>八年抗戰，三年內爭，兵連禍結，塗炭生靈。長此以往，不但民無瞧類，國家亦必難逃滅亡的命運。所幸天心厭亂，戾氣漸消，蔣總統指印發元且文告，倡導和平，又復毅然引退，以冀弭戰消兵。李代總統更願以高度之誠意，與最大之努力，謀取和平之實現。中共主席毛澤東先生亦廣播和談條件，藉示願意罷戰談和。目前雖因中共尚未派定代表，所以政府還不能和中共開始和談，似京滬人民和平代表先後飛赴北平，與中共當局交換意見，和平曙光實已啟露。我們飽經戰禍殘害的人民，豈能放過這一個眞正可以全面和平的機會？</p>
<p>首先，我們以爲要促成和平的實現，目前有必須努力達到者三點：（一）要求雙方立卽就地停戰。惟有在各戰綫立卽停戰，彼此不再進攻，彼此不再襲繫，彼此不再有任何軍事行動，纔可開闢和談的途徑，纔可顯示眞正謀和的誠意。（二）要求雙方同時停止宣傳攻擊。因爲雙方相互詆責的宣傳戰和神經戰，徒然激刺彼虎的惡感，妨害充嫌修好的機會，所以惟有卽日停止這種無謂的宣傳攻擊，消除彼此的隔閡和疑慮，方可造成和平的空氣與環境。（三）要求雙方迅速派定負責代表，在共同贊成的地瞇，開始全面和平的會談。我們知道政府代表早已派定，祇要中共也能早日派定代表，則和談一旦舉行，一切意見，自可在會議席上和衷共濟平心靜氣地討論，不難根據人民的公意，得到互諒亙讓的合理解決，全國同胞在戰爭氛園裏的沉重心情，也可因此而消滅。</p>
<p>其次，我們果俱要獲得眞正的永久的和平，而不是兩個戰爭時期中的間歇，則必須有下列二點共同認識，以爲我們人民爭取和平的辦法和目標：</p>
<p>第一，人民必須重視自己的地位和力量。因爲眞正需要活命而切望和平的是人民，惟其人民切望和平，故政府和共黨也都願意罷兵談和。亦惟其人民纔眞要和平，故今後全國和平會議，必須有眞正的人民代表負起責任，切實參加，提供不偏不倚大公至正的意見，使和平遝動得以早日圓滿完成，避免重蹈往年政治協商會議失敗的覆轍。</p>
<p>第二，和平的目的，是爲了救人民，爲了保障人民的生存與自由的。故和平會議的主題，應注重於今後國家政策和政府措施方針的規定。我們以爲政治制度儘可在自由平等博愛的大原則下，在不變更中華民國國體的大前提下，作適合時代環境的規定，而今後最重要的國策，不外：（一）政治民主化，（二）經濟社會化，（三）軍隊國家化的三大政策。要達到第一點，憲法固可依法修改，使各地區人民能充分發揮其自治能力，而凡使害人民自由生活和自由權利的不民主措施，無論任何地區，尤須絕對取消，使全國同胞應享的人機都能得到保陣。要達到第二點，必須根據平均地權的原則，來澈底實行鄉村的土地改革政策，根據節制資本的原則，來切實根治都市貧富不均的社會病態。我們需要一個不流血的社會革命，使今後的經濟制度，能由社會均產的途徑達成國家造產的任務。要達到第三點，我們十二萬分懇求雙方都把軍隊迅速交還給國家，好讓改組以後的政府，本大公無私的熊度，作一番切實有效的整編，使國家軍隊用以屯懇實邊，而解甲還鄉者都有生計可託，然後中國無窮的人力，均可使用之於生產建設，富強康樂的目的當然可以達到。</p>
<p>總之，我們老百姓今天實在感到活不下去了，實在需要大喊救命了！我們要向全國同胞，不分政府區域或中共區域的同胞，大聲疾呼，一致起來用行動爭取眞正永久的和平。民主自由萬歲！中華民族萬歲！中華民國萬歲！中華民國卅八年二月十四日全國和平促進會。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>人民怎樣實現和平主張？</h3>
<p>全國和平促進會在上海開會，昨日大會通過和平意見書和宣言之後，業已閉幕，此後執行決議案的任務落到了各位幹事的肩上。照目前情勢看，和平儘管有希望，而任重道遠，卻是人人都知道的。然則和平促進會的要求是否能達到，主張是否能貫澈，就全看幹事們的努力如何，而尤其要看全國人民熱烈支持的程度如何以爲斷。</p>
<p>表面看來，和平好像是政府與中共間之事，所以大家要和平，都先向他們雙方去呼籲，去哀求。實際說來，和平乃是人民切身利書所關的大事，必得由人民自己來爭取。語有之，「自求多福」。和平的幸福，決不能自己不努力而可以仰託作戰雙方所賞給我們的。故和平之獲得與否，我們不必探問政府與中共之意向如何，只須反問人民自己有否實現其主張的決心與毅力！</p>
<p>全國和平促進會所決議的立即停戰和全面和平二大要求，不可謂不中肯而迫切。它所決議的七項主張，尤其是政治民主化，經濟社會化，軍隊國家化，開放新聞自由，保障人樣和人民自由生活之方式等等，都爲當前人人認爲必須辦到的項目。至於全國和平會議應有人民代表參加，更是天經地義，只要人民不願爲被宰的羔羊者，沒有不贊成的。然而，這一篇說得動聽的宣言，和迫切的要求，美妙的主張，如何確能兌現，究竟不是易事，不在坐而言，尤貴起而行。</p>
<p>我們人民怎麼來行動，方可以實現我們的主張呢？卑之無甚高論，我們以爲還是要切切實實的笨做，認認眞眞的苦幹。大會代表李軔哉君說：希望大家有甘地救印度的精神，一定可以得到和平，一定可以救中國，不錯，甘地就是一位苦行的善薩！他的不合作主義，就是一種笨做苦幹的辦法。我們要在倚仗國際背景的好戰者魔掌之下，爭得和平，必須具備如甘地一樣的誠意與勇氣。我們首須用盡種種方法，喚起全體人民的自覺，打破隔離我們人民與人民的仿造的「鐵幕」，使得政府轄區與中共轄區的人民能够自由溝通消息，自由發表意見，自由喊出各向當局要求「和平」的呼聲。直到現在爲止，我們還不甘努力過將我們眞摯迫切的呼聲，傳達到中共控制地區裏的大多數人民的耳鼓。直到現在爲止，凡是一個地方爲中共所控制，人民就沒有看得到一條眞正的新聞、最近南京人民代表自北平回來就說，北平各種報紙已經成爲一套版的宣傳文章，就可證明。故第一步，我們必須用種種方法，喚起全國同胞對於爭取和平的共嗚，而不是專在這一方面地區裏亂嚷。</p>
<p>等到中共區域的人民，同我們一樣眞能喊「救命」，喊「和平」的時候，我們纔眞能做到「團結全國人民力量，促進全面和平」了。我們人民同時下了大決心，儘有方法可以迫使雙方好戰奢不能不放下他們的武器。但這些事，必得發動雙方的人民向着同一目標去幹，纔有意義。否則一方面不徴兵，而他方面仍然參軍，一方面不微糧，而他方而仍然獻糧，戰爭是依舊免不了的。故人民制止戰爭的手段，不是沒有，但其先決條件，必得團結全國的人民在一起，用行動來爭取。</p>
<p>在全國人民還被仿造的「鐵幕」隔離而不能團結一起的時候，我們爲爭取和平的實現，不得已而求其次，不妨參酌甘地不抵抗不合作的精神，動員全國愛好和平的人民，組織「人民和平團」，用來阻斷打仗的砲火。政府早說要弭戰銷兵，共產黨也口口聲聲說要「解放」人民，我們人民要和平，它們如果不給我們和平，我們就可集合在「人民和平團」的大　之下，以成千成萬的平民，赤手空拳，組織幾個分團，大家走上前綫，分向雙方當局要求停戰，要求和平。大家不要以爲這是後話，須知共黨可以用「人海戰術」來打仗，我們人民何嘗不可用「人海和衛」來求和？天下最大的力量，莫過於人力。我們人民自己有莫大的人力，求戰固可以戰，求和更可以得和。的確，我們人民活不下去了，久已要喊救命了！今天我們正需要幾個天眞的傻子自願受罪的菩薩如甘地一般，領導着無量數愛好和平而手無寸鐵的人民，組織「人民和平團」，在戰塲烽火中築起一條「和牆」來，代替打仗的壕溝！</p>
<h3>杜魯門向國會報吿　援華工作梗概　正從事特種努力使政府區獲益</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕杜魯門總統十四日對國會稱：美國對中國的援助，必須爲中國本身的增推生產及供給的努力的一種補助，而不能代替中國本身的努力。杜魯門在兩院委員會提出截至一九四八年八月卅日爲止的經合總署活動報告，杜魯門稱：現正從事特種努力，俾盡可能保證經合總署的供給品將使中國中央政府控制地區及華北被圍城市獲益。總統的報告中，舉出援華計劃情形的梗概，列舉各種目標及運出的商品，渠稱，「經合總署的棉花，已使中國最大工業的機輸維持旋轉，供應重要的棉織品，不但爲中國的國內市塲，並輸往遠東其他國家」。截至一九四八年九月三十日，經合總署已授權將價值五千四百七十萬美元的生棉三十七萬二千三百四十九包運往中國。渠稱，藉經合總署基金輸入中國的棉花，「僅足以維持中國的紡織生產的目前生產率」。</p>

<h3>四強代表討論奧和約　准奧南陳述意見　要索賠償問題發生激辯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播：今日對奧和約會議中，四強已同意南斯拉夫及奧國之代表得到塲發表意見，並決定卽行通知南外次貝勃勒，謂貝氏如有特別意見發表，可列席會議，同時並通知奧外長格雖勃可到塲辯諭。今日討論南國對奧要求一億五千萬美元之賠償時，四強曾有激辯。西方國家代表以爲波茨坦協定中，已規定不向奧國強索賠款。蘇代表柴魯平當辯稱，該協定係言四強不得向奧索償，而南國之要求則仍應予以考慮。柴氏發言頗爲寨愼，曾極力避免有袒護南國之意，僅表示南國或將修改其對奧要求，故有聽取其意見之必要。但最近數日內，貝勃勒未必列席會議。又蘇聯要求奧國境內若干油礦之讓步，並要求在奧境德國財產中提出價值一億五千萬美兀之一部運往蘇聯，此二點將於明日會中再作討諭。</p>
<h3>英外相竭力拉攏土耳其　成為反共陣營一環　挪威處境困難已獲英諒解</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十四日電〕挪外長蘭琪十四日與貝文外相秘密商談北大西洋公約，及蘇聯對挪威之建議問題。蘭氏於上午十一時半赴英外部會談，此次會談或將影響挪咸之覓致安全甚大。貝文擬於十四晚在挪大使館宴席上再會晤蘭氏，並擬於下午與土耳其外長沙達克晤談。土耳其與挪威相同，可能成爲歐洲反共陣營之一環。蘭氏並欲向貝文探詢對於斯坎的那維亞可能聯盟之意見。傳蘭氏對此日益表示同情。</p>
<p>挪威處境因難，一方面蘇聯加施壓力，不使參加任何公約；一方面瑞典亦加施壓力，促挪威加入斯坎的那維亞聯防而不加入大西洋公約。傳英方對挪威之處境採取「諒解」態度。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十四日電〔來英之土耳其外長沙達克，今日中午應英外相貝文之邀，與之共進午餐，下午並將與貝文在英外部再度會商。渠將於明日離英赴巴黎。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十四日電〕挪外長蘭琪頃吿記者稱，「吾人現有關於局勢之若干事實，渠認爲吾人將從緩進行之，不能立刻有所決議」。此一緩進政策，不僅適用於大西洋公約，亦過用於建議中之斯坎的那維亞聯盟及蘇聯建議之蘇挪不侵犯協定。英國要挪威參加大西洋公約，但正在避免對其加施壓力。貝文外相今日與蘭琪會晤之後，並接見土耳外外長沙達克，沙達克業已擯斥土耳其可能加入大西洋公約之說，但渠暗市地中海聯盟可能成立，與大西洋公約連擊。同時，英當局已暫時放棄將愛爾籣拉入大西洋公約之希望，因愛外長曾明白表示愛不準備參加該約，直至英國同意愛南北統一後，但此事己遭倫敦拒絕。</p>

<h3>南京和平代表抵滬　蒞會報吿北行經過</h3>
<p>南京人民和平代表吳裕俊報告該團北行經過，略謂：抵平後，由當局熱誠招待，第一日休息，翌午由聯合辦事處宴請，同座者有北平正副市長及委員七人，席間市畏葉劍英發言頗多，謂如有和談意見，請先以書面闡明，俾可準備解釋。九日晚七時起，葉劍英將軍卽與吾等分批談話，直至午夜二時始止。惜許多具體問題，均經推諉，謂須由中共中央決定，個人不能作主。關於戰犯問題，本人又曾向葉表示，中共抨擊蔣總統甚爲激烈，惟個人認爲蔣總統對中國，「功」多於「過」，此點葉表示同意，但亦有反駁。</p>
<h3>和談最大關鍵在於消除誤會</h3>
<p>根據本人所見，認爲和談最大關鍵在於消除誤會。且共黨並無出人頭地之處，所以演變至今日局面者，實由於自己之不爭氣。惟本人認爲共方並未將政府之力量估計過低，亦並無非打到底不可之企圓。</p>
<p>京市和平代表吳裕後　（中國社攝）</p>
<h3>街頭不復見國旗</h3>
<p>吳氏詞畢，當有在塲之代表數人發問：（一）中共爲何迄未派遺和談代表？（二）共軍進入北平後，國旗仍見諸街頭否？（三）傳作義將軍如何始終未與代表團見面？（四）新聞記者如何不准進城？經吳氏答稱：（一）據葉劍英將軍表示，中共要在北平完全解放後，再開始和談，所謂完全解放，當係指肅淸「國特」而言，現正積極調查戶口，準備此項工作。（二）國旗已不復見，卽警察之靑天白日帽徽，亦均經除去。（三）代表團本擬晉見傅將軍，聞傅將軍亦已同意，但始終未曾會晤，實爲此行中之最大憾事。（四）新聞記者未被接待，據稱係北平初經「解放」，一切尚未步入正軌，故希望新聞界暫緩訪問云云。</p>
<h3>邱致中發表談話</h3>
<p>中國人民和平策進會常務理事邱致中，以該會決議遷滬，於昨（十四日）晚乘車抵此，接見本報記者，告以昨日彼等六人，以中外各報所載該團在平消息，頗多出入，影饗太大，故予以更正，茲見滬報散播吳某談話，似有攻訐之嫌，不能不再費數語解釋：（一）葉劍英將軍爲吾人洗塵時，吳某尚不認語，則直接通電話有私交之說何來？（二）數人否定一人簽字卽可，何用偽造印章？（三）吳某欲十四日晨晉謁李代總統則十二日在總統府集會，與十三日午後三時召見之說不攻自破。（四）林彪·聶榮臻兩將軍是否在平均屬問題，吳某何處得見？（五）吳某向合衆社所談各點，既有排撥與侮辱國共黨局之嫌，又復欺　江南同胞，可謂失言。（六）葉劍英將軍向吾人一再解釋，必須以「八條」爲談判之基礎，尤其強調「改編軍隊」一點，未聞讓步之說。（七）中共當局對本團呼籲和平，純採解釋熊度，何來具體條件帶回，過幾天發表？</p>
<p>總之，和策會本爲數十人民團體聯合組成，原爲不辭艱險策進和平，非以此爲投機工具。現竟有人隨意發表不正確消息，致影響團體名譽，殊爲抱憾。以後如再有經言妄語，無中生有，爲節省吾人對全國同胞服務時間，不復辭費。</p>

<p>據調查：以目前全市存棉量估計，尚足敷各廠開工雨月之需。而全市紗廠，（包括蘇浙皖京滬區，）每月原棉之消耗量，約爲十五萬担。全國紗廠原棉之需要量，約爲廿五萬担云。</p>

<h3>Acting President Li Tells Supervisors He Will Do His Utmost to Promote Peace; Summons Wu Yuru and Others for Detailed Inquiries About the Communist Side’s Opinions; Yan Huiqing and His Entourage Arrive Safely in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Acting President Li formally expressed to the more than 50 supervisors who came to Nanjing on the 14th his determination to do his utmost to promote peace. He said: Although there are still many difficulties in the future of peace, he is determined to seek it with the greatest patience. He believes that he will eventually succeed. Acting President Li's confidence in the future of peace has left a deep impression on the supervisors. Acting President Li stated that peace is the current need, and the people of any region need peace. Politics lose its meaning if it departs from the demands of the people. Based on this point of view, he believes that the peace he is working for will eventually be realized. The supervisors had previously submitted a letter to Acting President Li, inquiring about the following four matters, to which Acting President Li gave oral answers: (1) Regarding the issue of the Executive Yuan moving to Guangzhou, the Legislative Yuan was not consulted in advance, nor was a presidential order obtained. The procedure was improper, and the Supervisory Yuan has filed a censure motion. Acting President Li stated: He hopes to make the Executive Yuan return to Nanjing as much as possible, or at least have the heads of the ministries and commissions return to Nanjing to work. (2) The Central Bank should be prevented from transporting its gold and silver reserves south. Acting President Li stated: After he took office, the Central Bank's gold and silver have not been transported south again. (3) Regarding the retention of troop designations and the supply of military necessities, food, and pay, since some troop designations have become nominal or the number of personnel is insufficient after fierce battles, military necessities, food, and pay should be issued based on actual needs to avoid abuse. Acting President Li stated: He will discuss this matter with Mr. He Jingzhi (Yingqin). (4) Regarding the issue of the future of peace, Acting President Li stated: The government is determined to seek it with the greatest sincerity and effort.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] Wu Yuru told the United Press on the 14th that Acting President Li was satisfied with the "preconditions" set by the Chinese Communists for opening peace talks and allowed him to do his utmost to meet the conditions set by the Chinese Communists. These conditions were given to the delegation by General Ye Jianying to be forwarded to the Nanjing government. Wu Yuru still refused to disclose the content, but stated that Acting President Li allowed immediate action to be taken to carry out the preconditions that he could implement without consulting the Executive Yuan in his capacity, and that he would soon discuss other preconditions with the Executive Yuan. He also stated that Acting President Li expressed optimism about the prospect of a peaceful resolution and would use various means to achieve a peaceful resolution. The acting president also hoped that the Chinese Communists would also "understand him and the government's" sincerity in politically resolving China's long-term civil war.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] At 9:00 a.m. on the 14th, Acting President Li summoned the representatives of the People's Peace Delegation who had gone to Beiping to listen to their account of the negotiations with the Chinese Communist personnel. However, due to internal disagreements within the delegation, only Wu Yuru, Wu Zhesheng, and Miao Diqing went to visit. Acting President Li inquired in detail about the opinions of the Chinese Communist side, and Wu and others reported in detail. They left around 10:00 a.m. Wu and the other two flew to Shanghai by plane in the afternoon of the 14th. Another representative of the delegation, Qiu Zhizhong, also went to Shanghai on the morning of the 14th. (Please read the fourth page for news after Wu and Qiu arrive in Shanghai.)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 14th] The special plane carrying the Shanghai Peace Delegation departed Qingdao for Beiping at 1:45 p.m. on the 14th. On the morning of the 14th, a telegram came from the Communist side in Beiping, refusing to allow the accompanying personnel to travel with them. After the delegation telegraphed the entire list to Beiping at noon and made further contact, they finally obtained the Communist side's consent. The delegation went to Cangku Airport from the Guest House at 10:00 a.m. to wait for the plane. The tire of the special plane exploded during landing yesterday. China Airlines flight 515 flew from Shanghai to Qingdao at 7:50 a.m. to bring a new tire to repair the peace special plane.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 14th] Gu Lecun, the telecommunications section chief dispatched by Shanghai China Airlines, accompanied the Shanghai Peace Delegation via Qingdao to Beiping to negotiate with the Communist side on aviation issues in the Kuomintang-Communist areas.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 14th] Huang Qihan, a representative of the Shanghai Peace Delegation, met with reporters and directly denied seeking a "glorious peace." Huang said: "Peace is for the people, there is no such thing as glory or shame." This morning, the local newspapers reported that Huang had said, "What we seek is a glorious, permanent peace, not a temporary peace." Huang personally wrote a letter to correct this, saying, "I did not mention the word 'glory,' but only said 'a real, permanent peace.'"</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to China Airlines: The special plane of the Shanghai Peace Delegation, which left Shanghai for Beiping the day before yesterday, stopped in Qingdao overnight. After the tires were replaced yesterday, it continued to take off from Qingdao at 1:15 p.m. and arrived safely in Beiping at 4:30 p.m. During their talks with the Communist side, the special plane will stay in Beiping so that the delegation can take it back to Shanghai after the mission is completed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Gan Jiehou, Acting President Li's personal representative, left Shanghai at noon on the 14th to return to Nanjing to report to Acting President Li on the arrangements for the Peace Delegation's trip to Beiping. It is also said that Gan will come to Shanghai again when the delegation returns south.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Arrives in Nanjing Upon Invitation; Reportedly Intends to Stay in Nanjing to Assist Acting President Li in Seeking Peace; Denies Rumors of Assuming an Important Position</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Former Minister of National Defense He Yingqin flew to Nanjing from Shanghai on the Ziqiang special plane at 4:00 p.m. on the 14th at the invitation of Acting President Li. Acting President Li specially dispatched legislator Cheng Siyuan as a representative to greet him. Those who arrived in Nanjing on the same plane included Gan Jiehou, Huang Shaohong, Jiang Dingwen, Leng Xin, Peng Zhaoxian, Zhang Shouxian, etc. He wore a suit with a dark blue overcoat and looked energetic. After getting off the plane, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcomers one by one, and then returned to his residence at Doujizha to rest.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] After He Yingqin arrived in Nanjing on the 14th, he told reporters that Acting President Li was indeed sincere in seeking peace. During the period of promoting the realization of peace, Acting President Li was very hardworking, and he would stay in Nanjing to help Acting President Li. He denied the rumors that he would assume an important military position, but he also did not disclose what position he would hold. He met with a group of visiting reporters after arriving at his residence in Nanjing. Regarding the peace issue, He said that peace was needed by the people of the whole country, and everyone thought it was best not to fight anymore, so he intended to stay in Nanjing to assist Acting President Li in striving for peace. He also believed that peace should be resolved through negotiations between the two sides, and he apparently disagreed with mediation by the United Nations. As for his future whereabouts, he refused to express his opinion, but said that he had planned to retire after the victory. As for whether he would go to Taiwan or Guangzhou, he said he had not considered it yet. He's hemorrhoids had healed. A reporter asked if he could drink alcohol now that he was better. He replied, "I can drink now!"</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] At 7:00 p.m. on the 14th, Acting President Li hosted a banquet at the Chuanhougang official residence to welcome He Yingqin, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai upon invitation. Those attending the banquet also included Gan Jiehou, Huang Shaohong, Jiang Dingwen, Gu Zhutong, Zhou Zhirou, Gui Yongqing, Guo Chan, etc. They exchanged views on general issues of current concern, and the banquet ended around 9:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Again Earnestly Declines the Task of Peace Talk Representative; Xinjiang-Soviet Trade Agreement Still in the Exploratory Stage</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 14th] There are varying rumors regarding General Zhang Zhizhong's resignation as peace talk representative. According to relevant sources: Zhang did send separate telegrams to Acting President Li and Premier Sun on the 6th of this month, requesting to resign from the representative task. Acting President Li telegraphed back on the 7th to comfort and retain him, and asked Zhang to come to Nanjing immediately. Zhang believed that his responsibilities in the Northwest were important and feared that he would make mistakes, so he telegraphed again on the 10th to earnestly decline. He is currently awaiting Acting President Li's reply for approval.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 14th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on the 14th that China and the Soviet Union have not yet reached an agreement on the Xinjiang trade agreement. The negotiations are being held by Liu Zhirong, special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Xinjiang, and the Soviet consul in Dihua, and are still in the exploratory stage. They have been intermittent for the past two years, and Zhang Zhizhong has personally presided over them since last month. It is generally believed that once the agreement is reached, the Soviet Union may thereby support the central government's current peace policy.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Flies to Chengdu; Decides to Take Office After Returning to Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 14th] Zhang Qun flew from Chongqing to Chengdu at 3:45 p.m. on the 14th. Sichuan Chairman Wang Lingji, Secretary-General Meng Guangpeng, senior advisor Liu Hangchen, Chongqing legislator Hu Ziang, Guizhou Construction Department Director He Jiwu, Yunnan Provincial Government Member Yang Shisheng, and confidential secretary Zhou Junliang, and 13 other people accompanied him. Zhang met with reporters for the first time at the airport and said that this trip was to visit his elderly mother and listen to opinions from all sides. He avoided answering how to stabilize Sichuan's policies, but affirmed: (1) He will decide to take office after returning to Chongqing from Chengdu; (2) All opinions will be expressed at that time. It is also said that after Zhang meets with Liu Wenhui, a conference on political and economic decision-making for Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, and Guizhou will be formally held in Chengdu. Deng Xihou, however, remained in Chongqing to handle official duties.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 14th] Zhang Qun and Wang Lingji arrived in Chengdu on the 14th from Chongqing. Liu Wenhui and Guan Linzheng welcomed him at the airport. Zhang said that this trip was to visit local elders and people from all walks of life, listen to opinions on stabilizing the construction of Sichuan and Xikang, and the Southwest, and discuss issues concerning Sichuan and Xikang with Chairmen Wang and Liu. Wang strongly denied the rumors that the situation in Sichuan was turbulent.</p>
<h3>Ma Jiyuan Arrives in Lanzhou</h3>
<p>Reports on Defense to Zhang Zhizhong</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 14th] Ma Jiyuan, commander of the 82nd Army, arrived in Lanzhou from Longdong to report on defense matters to Chief Zhang Zhizhong, make requests, and will return to Xining.</p>
<h3>Tong Guanxian Travels Between Nanjing and Shanghai; Attends Discussions of Legislators in Both Places; The Location of the Legislative Yuan's Resumption of Meetings Can Be Decided</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] President of the Legislative Yuan Tong Guanxian arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai by car around 7:00 a.m. on the 14th. After resting briefly at his private residence, he went to the Legislative Yuan to handle official business. In the afternoon, he attended a discussion meeting of legislators in Nanjing to report on his trip to the south. He then visited Acting President Li at 8:00 p.m. for discussions. He then took the night train to Shanghai and will attend a discussion meeting of legislators in Shanghai on the 15th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] More than 20 legislators in Nanjing held a discussion meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the 14th. Rong Zhao presided over the meeting. First, President Tong, who had just returned from Guangzhou, reported on his trip to the south. Tong gave a general description of his impressions of this trip and reported that some legislators in Guangzhou advocated resuming meetings in Guangzhou, while others agreed to return to Nanjing to resume meetings, and the location of the resumption of meetings would depend on the opinions of various parties. Then, the legislators discussed the issue of resuming meetings, and they all believed that the Legislative Yuan should resume meetings within this month in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. As for the location of the resumption of meetings, they believed that since the government had not moved the capital and the Legislative Yuan had not made a resolution to convene the third session in another location, it was only natural to resume meetings in Nanjing. They also knew for sure that resuming meetings in Nanjing was the unanimous proposal of legislators from Shanghai, Taiwan, Wuhan, and Guilin, and there were still more than 60 staff members of the Legislative Yuan Secretariat remaining in Nanjing, so there were no problems in terms of business. Therefore, it is expected that after the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, Chen Kewen, returns to Nanjing on the 16th, he will summarize the opinions of legislators from various places and make a final decision so that the meeting notices can be sent out in time.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of whether the Legislative Yuan will convene in Nanjing or Guangzhou, the Youth Party recently solicited the opinions of legislators of the Youth Party and telegraphed to Youth Party legislators in various places to gather in Shanghai to exchange views in order to discuss the location of the third session of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>A Major Case of Kidnapping Occurs During the Distribution of Northeast Relief Funds; Mo Dehui is Robbed of 20 Million Yuan Before Leaving Shanghai for Taiwan; The Case is Bizarre and Horrifying; Liu Zhe Requests the Supervisory Yuan to Investigate Thoroughly and Impeach</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The matter of Mo Dehui being "kidnapped" in Shanghai and robbed of 20 million yuan before going to Taiwan has been confirmed on the 14th by Liu Zhe, Vice President of the Supervisory Yuan, who arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai. Liu also jointly proposed a motion with supervisors He Jishu and Chen Lishan for this matter, and submitted it to the Supervisory Yuan's plenary session on the 15th for discussion. According to Liu: Mo distributed 60 million yuan in Northeast relief funds in Shanghai on the 6th, all in the form of Central Bank banknotes worth 20,000 yuan each. By midnight, only a few hundred people had received them. Those who did not receive them questioned the person in charge of the distribution and searched their bodies, finding 400 to 500 banknotes. The four distribution personnel were then sent to the Garrison Headquarters. On the 7th, a man claiming to be "Legislator Feng Yun" asked to see Mo in the office of the Inspector General of the Huangpu Police Bureau. He threatened Mo with a pistol, forcibly demanding a Central Bank check for 20 million yuan, and forced Mo to accompany him to cash it before leaving. This matter is extremely bizarre. Liu has decided that in addition to submitting it to the plenary session, he will also report it to Acting President Li. Liu's request to the Supervisory Yuan to send personnel to investigate the loan fraud of the Northeast Materials Clearing Committee and the robbery of funds by thugs, as well as the distribution of huge sums of money to non-Northeast refugees by people outside the committee who falsely claimed to be it, stated: "It is found that the Northeast Materials Bureau has a lot of materials stored in Tianjin and Shanghai. Zhe and Mr. Mo Liuzhen previously wrote to the President, requesting that a portion be allocated to relieve public educators and refugees in Beijing, Shanghai, Taiwan, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. The President Chiang approved it and handed it over to the Executive Yuan for discussion. Recently, I heard that someone is using the name of the Northeast Materials Clearing Committee to sell the materials at low prices without using auction procedures, planning to distribute 2,000 yuan to each Northeast refugee and 20,000 yuan to each National Assembly representative, legislator, and supervisor, totaling 70 to 80 million yuan. The remaining materials are planned to continue to be sold, worth no less than 400 to 500 million yuan. I also heard that each person in charge used a lot of money, causing public outrage and causing a stir. The Clearing Committee then sent 60 million yuan to the Huangpu Police Bureau for redistribution, but someone robbed and hid more than 30 million yuan in the middle of the night, and it is said that three people have been arrested. There was also someone who forced Mr. Mo with a pistol and robbed him of 20 million yuan, which is like kidnapping. Such a phenomenon occurred in broad daylight, which is extremely bizarre, so that real Northeast refugees could not get it. I also heard that the day after Mr. Mo went to Taiwan, someone who was neither from the Northeast nor from the Clearing Committee distributed 100 million yuan to non-Northeast refugees. I don't know what their intentions are. Please ask the conference to elect a committee to investigate thoroughly and formally impeach them to warn the stubborn."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 14th] US Navy Undersecretary Karny, who was passing through here on his way to inspect US naval facilities around the world, said that the establishment of the US Western Pacific defense plan depends on when and how the situation in China becomes certain.

This matter should be decided by the commander of the Western Pacific Fleet, Badger, according to the circumstances.

<h3>National Peace Promotion Association Declaration</h3>
<p>[This City News] The National Peace Promotion Association held in Shanghai concluded on the 14th and issued the following declaration:</p>
<p>We, representatives of provincial and municipal councils, national professional groups, cultural groups, and women's groups, have been meeting in Shanghai for three days since February 12 of this year to discuss ways to promote national peace. Standing from the perspective of the people, with heavy hearts, we conducted serious discussions and passed a proposal for promoting peace, consisting of two major demands and seven proposals. This proposal has already been published separately, and it has been decided to organize a permanent institution to continue to advance the peace movement based on the resolutions of the conference, seeking the enthusiastic support of compatriots throughout the country. We will not cease until the goal of a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities is achieved. Now, as the conference concludes, we respectfully summarize our beliefs and inform our compatriots throughout the country.</p>
<p>Eight years of war against Japan, three years of civil strife, continuous warfare, and widespread suffering. If this continues, not only will the people have no chance of survival, but the country will inevitably face the fate of destruction. Fortunately, Heaven is tired of chaos, and the violence is gradually subsiding. President Chiang issued a statement advocating peace and resolutely resigned to end the war. Acting President Li is also willing to use the utmost sincerity and effort to seek the realization of peace. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party also broadcast peace negotiation conditions, showing his willingness to cease hostilities and negotiate peace. Although the CCP has not yet appointed a representative, so the government cannot yet begin peace talks with the CCP, it seems that peace representatives from Nanjing and Shanghai have flown to Peiping one after another to exchange views with the CCP authorities, and the dawn of peace has indeed begun to appear. We, the people who have suffered so much from the ravages of war, cannot afford to miss this opportunity for genuine and comprehensive peace.</p>
<p>First of all, we believe that to promote the realization of peace, there are three points that must be worked hard to achieve: (1) Demand that both sides immediately cease fire on the spot. Only with an immediate ceasefire on all fronts, with neither side attacking each other, neither side raiding each other, and neither side taking any military action, can a path to peace talks be opened, and only then can the sincerity of genuinely seeking peace be demonstrated. (2) Demand that both sides simultaneously stop propaganda attacks. Because the propaganda war and psychological warfare of mutual denigration only serve to provoke each other's animosity and hinder the opportunity to resolve disputes and make amends. Therefore, only by immediately stopping this pointless propaganda attack and eliminating each other's estrangement and doubts can a peaceful atmosphere and environment be created. (3) Demand that both sides quickly appoint responsible representatives to begin comprehensive peace talks in a mutually agreeable location. We know that the government representatives have already been appointed. As long as the CCP can also appoint representatives soon, once peace talks begin, all opinions can be discussed calmly and peacefully at the conference table, and a mutually understanding and reasonable solution can be reached based on the public will. The heavy mood of the compatriots throughout the country in the atmosphere of war can also be eliminated as a result.</p>
<p>Secondly, if we truly want to achieve genuine and lasting peace, rather than an interval between two periods of war, then we must have the following two common understandings as our people's methods and goals for striving for peace:</p>
<p>First, the people must value their own position and strength. Because it is the people who truly need to survive and earnestly desire peace. Only because the people earnestly desire peace are the government and the Communist Party willing to cease hostilities and negotiate peace. And only because the people truly want peace must genuine people's representatives take responsibility and earnestly participate in future national peace conferences, providing impartial and fair opinions, so that the peace movement can be completed smoothly as soon as possible, avoiding repeating the failures of past political consultation conferences.</p>
<p>Second, the purpose of peace is to save the people and to protect the people's survival and freedom. Therefore, the theme of the peace conference should focus on the future national policy and government measures. We believe that the political system can be made suitable for the times under the general principles of freedom, equality, and fraternity, and under the major premise of not changing the national system of the Republic of China. The most important national policies in the future are nothing more than: (1) political democratization, (2) economic socialization, and (3) nationalization of the military. To achieve the first point, the constitution can be amended according to law so that the people of all regions can fully exercise their autonomy. And any undemocratic measures that harm the people's free life and freedom of rights, regardless of the region, must be absolutely abolished so that the human rights that compatriots throughout the country should enjoy can be guaranteed. To achieve the second point, the policy of land reform in the countryside must be thoroughly implemented based on the principle of equal land rights, and the social ills of uneven wealth in cities must be effectively eradicated based on the principle of controlling capital. We need a bloodless social revolution so that the future economic system can achieve the task of national wealth creation through the path of social equality of production. To achieve the third point, we implore both sides to return the military to the country as soon as possible so that the reorganized government can conduct effective reorganization with an impartial attitude, so that the national military can be used to garrison and develop the borders, and those who are discharged and return to their hometowns have a livelihood to depend on. Then, China's infinite human resources can be used for production and construction, and the goal of prosperity and happiness can certainly be achieved.</p>
<p>In short, we ordinary people really feel that we cannot survive today, and we really need to cry out for help! We want to shout to our compatriots throughout the country, regardless of whether they are in the government area or the CCP area, to unite and use action to strive for genuine and lasting peace. Long live democracy and freedom! Long live the Chinese nation! Long live the Republic of China! National Peace Promotion Association, February 14, 38th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How Can the People Realize Their Peace Proposals?</h3>
<p>The National Peace Promotion Association held a meeting in Shanghai. Yesterday, after the conference passed the peace proposal and declaration, it has concluded, and the task of implementing the resolutions has fallen on the shoulders of the directors. Judging from the current situation, although peace is hopeful, everyone knows that the task is arduous and the road is long. Therefore, whether the demands of the Peace Promotion Association can be met and whether the proposals can be implemented depends entirely on the efforts of the directors, and especially on the degree of enthusiastic support from the people throughout the country.</p>
<p>On the surface, peace seems to be a matter between the government and the CCP, so everyone who wants peace first appeals and begs to both sides. In reality, peace is a major issue related to the vital interests of the people and must be fought for by the people themselves. As the saying goes, "God helps those who help themselves." The happiness of peace can never be achieved by relying on the warring parties to bestow it upon us without our own efforts. Therefore, whether peace can be obtained or not, we do not need to ask about the intentions of the government and the CCP, but only need to ask ourselves whether the people have the determination and perseverance to realize their proposals!</p>
<p>The two major demands of immediate ceasefire and comprehensive peace resolved by the National Peace Promotion Association cannot be said to be irrelevant and urgent. The seven proposals it resolved, especially political democratization, economic socialization, nationalization of the military, open press freedom, and protection of human rights and the people's free way of life, are all items that everyone currently believes must be done. As for the participation of people's representatives in the National Peace Conference, it is even more of a matter of course. As long as the people do not want to be lambs to be slaughtered, no one will disapprove. However, it is not easy to ensure that this eloquent declaration, urgent demands, and wonderful proposals can be cashed in. It is not about sitting and talking, but about taking action.</p>
<p>How can we, the people, act to realize our proposals? Without offering any profound theories, we believe that we still need to do practical and hard work. Mr. Li Rentzai, a representative of the conference, said: "I hope that everyone has the spirit of Gandhi saving India, and we will surely achieve peace and save China." Indeed, Gandhi is a suffering Bodhisattva! His non-cooperation movement is a method of doing practical and hard work. To win peace from under the clutches of warmongers who rely on international backgrounds, we must have the same sincerity and courage as Gandhi. We must first exhaust all methods to awaken the self-awareness of all the people, break the artificial "iron curtain" that separates us people from people, so that the people in the government-controlled areas and the CCP-controlled areas can freely communicate news, freely express their opinions, and freely shout out their appeals to the authorities for "peace." Until now, we have not made enough effort to convey our sincere and urgent appeals to the ears of the majority of people in the CCP-controlled areas. Until now, whenever a place is controlled by the CCP, the people cannot see a single real piece of news. The recent return of Nanjing people's representatives from Peiping said that various newspapers in Peiping have become a set of propaganda articles, which can prove this. Therefore, the first step is that we must use all methods to awaken the resonance of compatriots throughout the country for striving for peace, rather than just shouting in this one area.</p>
<p>When the people in the CCP area can shout "help" and "peace" as sincerely as we do, we can truly achieve "uniting the strength of the people throughout the country to promote comprehensive peace." We, the people, have also made a great determination and have many ways to force the warmongers on both sides to lay down their weapons. But these things must be done by mobilizing the people on both sides towards the same goal to have meaning. Otherwise, if one side does not conscript soldiers while the other side still joins the army, and if one side does not levy food while the other side still contributes food, the war will still be unavoidable. Therefore, the people's means of stopping the war are not absent, but the prerequisite is that we must unite the people throughout the country and use action to fight for it.</p>
<p>When the people throughout the country are still separated by the artificial "iron curtain" and cannot unite together, we have no choice but to seek second best in order to strive for the realization of peace. We may as well refer to Gandhi's spirit of non-resistance and non-cooperation and mobilize the peace-loving people throughout the country to organize "People's Peace Corps" to block the fire of war. The government has long said that it wants to end the war, and the Communist Party has also repeatedly said that it wants to "liberate" the people. If they do not give us peace, we can gather under the banner of the "People's Peace Corps," with tens of thousands of civilians, empty-handed, organize several detachments, and everyone go to the front line to demand a ceasefire and peace from both parties. Everyone should not think that this is a later story. It must be known that the Communist Party can use "human wave tactics" to fight. Why can't we, the people, use "human wave peace defense" to seek peace? The greatest power in the world is none other than human power. We, the people, have great human power. We can fight if we seek war, and we can obtain peace if we seek peace. Indeed, we, the people, cannot survive and have long been crying out for help! Today, we need several naive fools, self-willing suffering bodhisattvas like Gandhi, to lead countless peace-loving and unarmed people to organize "People's Peace Corps" to build a "peace wall" in the flames of war to replace the trenches of war!</p>
<h3>Truman Reports to Congress on Aid to China; Special Efforts Being Made to Benefit Government Areas</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 14th] President Truman told Congress on the 14th that American aid to China must be a supplement to China's own efforts to promote production and supply, and cannot replace China's own efforts. Truman submitted a report on the activities of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) up to August 30, 1948, to the House and Senate committees. Truman said that special efforts were being made to ensure that ECA supplies would benefit areas controlled by the Chinese Central Government and besieged cities in North China as much as possible. In his report, the President outlined the situation of the aid to China program, listing various goals and exported goods. He said, "ECA cotton has kept the machinery of China's largest industry turning, supplying important cotton textiles not only for China's domestic market but also for export to other countries in the Far East." As of September 30, 1948, ECA had authorized the shipment of 372,349 bales of raw cotton worth US$54.7 million to China. He said that the cotton imported into China through ECA funds "is only enough to maintain the current productivity of China's textile production."</p>
<p>[United Press Guangzhou 14th] A spokesman for the Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch announced today that he was unaware of reports that Director Lapham recently stated in Guangzhou that he would request the United States to expand the aid to China program or extend the current aid to China program beyond March 4.

<h3>CCP Agrees to Resume Shipping, Shipping Industry Expresses Excitement; British Shipping Company Prepares to Start North China Business</h3>
<p>[This City News] Chairman Mao Zedong of the CCP and Mayor Ye Jianying of Peiping expressed their approval of the Shanghai shipping industry's hope to resume shipping in North China and are prepared to receive representatives of the shipping industry who go north to discuss shipping matters. People in the shipping industry here expressed their excitement upon hearing the news. They believe that: (1) Resuming shipping in North China can facilitate the exchange of goods. (2) Regardless of any circumstances, shipping rights must be protected. (3) Barter trade can be used to enhance the relationship between the North and the South. As for technical issues related to shipping, it will be resolved after shipping industry representatives Wei Wenhan and others arrive in Peiping and negotiate with the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] The National Shipowners Association officially received a reply telegram from the CCP agreeing to resume shipping between North China and Shanghai and welcoming the sending of personnel to North China to negotiate.

Resuming shipping between North China and Shanghai is extremely important for the development of production. We welcome the northward sailing of the "Great Shanghai" and "Tangshan" ships and the dispatch of personnel to North China for negotiation. We have instructed Mayor Ye Jianying of Peiping and Mayor Huang Jing of Tianjin to prepare to receive them. The arrival of the British Swire Company's "Hunan" at Tanggu is temporary and was not negotiated in advance. The so-called Chinese ships from Central and South China will not be allowed to return to their original places when they sail to North China ports is pure rumor. You should not believe it.

<h3>Price Assessments in Changsha Higher Than Original Prices</h3>
<p>Merchants Smile, Citizens Gnash Teeth</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Changsha 14th] The city government has officially announced the price assessments for various commodities with price limits in Changsha. However, not only are the prices much higher than the prices of one to two weeks ago, they are even higher than the prices of recent days. For example, a bowl of noodles was only sold for 150 Gold Yuan in food stores on the 13th, but the assessed price is 2.2 Silver Yuan. Based on the exchange rate of Silver Yuan at 1,100 Gold Yuan, it would cost 220 Gold Yuan on the 14th. In the past, stores were extremely dissatisfied with the price limits of the city government, but after the announcement of the price assessments, they were all dumbfounded and smiled.

<h3>Four Powers' Representatives Discuss Austrian Peace Treaty; Allow Austrian and Yugoslav Representatives to Present Their Views; Heated Debate Arises Over Reparations Issue</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Agency] London, 14th Broadcast: Today, at the Austrian Peace Treaty Conference, the four powers agreed to allow representatives from Yugoslavia and Austria to present their views on the scene. It was also decided to immediately notify Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Bebler that if Mr. Bebler has special views to express, he may attend the meeting, and Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber was also notified to come to the scene to debate. Today, when discussing Yugoslavia's demand for $150 million in reparations from Austria, the four powers had a heated debate. Representatives of Western countries believed that the Potsdam Agreement stipulated that no reparations should be forcibly demanded from Austria. Soviet representative Zaru Ping argued that the agreement stated that the four powers should not demand reparations from Austria, while Yugoslavia's demands should still be considered. Mr. Zaru's speech was quite cautious, and he tried his best to avoid the intention of favoring Yugoslavia, only expressing that Yugoslavia may revise its demands on Austria, so it is necessary to listen to its views. However, Bebler may not attend the meeting in the next few days. In addition, the Soviet Union's request for the concession of some oil fields in Austria and the request to transport a part of the German property in Austria worth $150 million to the Soviet Union, these two points will be discussed again in tomorrow's meeting.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Exerts Efforts to Win Over Turkey; To Become a Link in the Anti-Communist Camp; Norway's Difficult Situation Has Been Understood by Britain</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th Dispatch] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange secretly discussed the North Atlantic Treaty and the Soviet Union's proposals to Norway with Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 14th. Mr. Lange went to the British Foreign Office at 11:30 AM for talks. This meeting may have a significant impact on Norway's search for security. Bevin plans to meet with Mr. Lange again at the Norwegian Embassy banquet on the evening of the 14th and also plans to meet with Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak in the afternoon. Turkey, like Norway, may become a link in the European anti-communist camp. Mr. Lange also wants to inquire with Bevin about his views on the possible Scandinavian alliance. It is said that Mr. Lange is increasingly expressing sympathy for this.</p>
<p>Norway's difficult situation is due to the pressure from the Soviet Union not to participate in any treaty on the one hand, and the pressure from Sweden to join the Scandinavian defense alliance without joining the Atlantic Treaty on the other hand. It is said that the British side has adopted an "understanding" attitude towards Norway's situation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th Dispatch] Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak, who came to England, was invited by British Foreign Secretary Bevin for lunch at noon today and will meet with Bevin again in the British Foreign Office in the afternoon. He will leave England for Paris tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th Dispatch] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange recently told reporters, "We now have some facts about the situation, and he believes that we will proceed slowly and cannot make a decision immediately." This slow-moving policy applies not only to the Atlantic Treaty but also to the proposed Scandinavian alliance and the Soviet Union's proposed Soviet-Norwegian non-aggression pact. Britain wants Norway to participate in the Atlantic Treaty but is avoiding putting pressure on it. After Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Mr. Lange today, he also received Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak. Sadak has rejected the possibility of Turkey joining the Atlantic Treaty, but he secretly implied that a Mediterranean alliance could be established, linked to the Atlantic Treaty. At the same time, the British authorities have temporarily abandoned the hope of bringing Ireland into the Atlantic Treaty because the Irish Foreign Minister has clearly stated that Ireland is not prepared to participate in the treaty until Britain agrees to the reunification of North and South Ireland, but this matter has been rejected by London.</p>

<h3>Significant Achievements of the US Aid to Europe Program</h3>
<p>Truman Reports to Congress</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th Dispatch] President Truman today submitted the second term's COA (Cooperation Organization Administration) activity report as of August 30th, 1948, as the two-house committee is considering the $5.58 billion EU assistance. Truman claims that the communist propaganda that attempts to damage the COA has failed. He claims that he is optimistic about this plan and has provided numbers and charts to verify his statement that: "We have gained achievements in the revival of Western Europe." In his report, the president claims that the preliminary goal of the "European Revival Plan" is to ensure that Western Europe achieves a satisfactory level of economic activity as soon as possible, without relying on additional external aid. Western Europe must be self-sufficient, but it must avoid reducing people's living standards to the point of losing their original levels, as this will cause suffering and anxiety. Although the COA's report is four months behind the current revival work, it still reflects the gains in Western Europe since the Marshall Plan began last April. For example, "The total industrial and mining output in the third term of 1948 increased by 10% compared to the previous year. Except for the reduction in steel output in West Germany, steel output is far higher than the productivity in 1938. Agricultural production in Europe also had significantly high harvests compared to the previous year, although the total output is still lower than before the war. Regarding Europe's labor supply and production capacity, the report pointed out that the distribution of labor must be more effective, and the level of production capacity must also be improved.</p>

<p>Questioned President Truman</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th Dispatch] Republican foreign policy leader Senator Vandenberg asked President Truman on the 14th to estimate the amount of military supplies the United States plans to ship to Western Europe. When meeting with reporters, Mr. Fan said that before Congress discusses the $5.58 billion aid fund for external parties, it must know the amount of the proposed military lease program. According to informal estimates, the amount is about one to two billion US dollars. Truman did not make an accurate estimate when he presented his budget last month.</p>

When asked whether the rumor that Mindszenty was forced to confess with drugs was true, McNeil replied: The bishop's actions after and before his arrest were very different. Mr. Mai said: The government and the ambassador to Hungary unanimously believed that the trial of Mindszenty was unfair.</p>
<h3>Israel Asks Egypt to Cooperate to Oppose British Interference in the Middle East; Negotiations on Rhodes Island Are Not Promising</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rhodes Island, 14th Dispatch] Israeli War Minister Colonel Yadin, who is currently a senior military representative in the ceasefire negotiations, asked Egypt and Israel on the 14th to jointly oppose the so-called British interference in the Middle East. When Mr. Ye met with reporters from this agency, he said, "Egypt and Israel have many common problems and can cooperate in military, economic and political affairs in the future, which will benefit the two countries and prevent any possible British interference in the region."</p>

The conference announced its successful conclusion at 7:00 PM yesterday. The most important motion passed yesterday was the association's peace promotion opinion, which includes the following:</p>
<h3>Peace Promotion Opinion</h3>
<p>Two Major Demands:</p>
<p>(1) Demand that both parties immediately cease fire on the spot and stop all mutually accusatory propaganda to show sincerity in seeking peace. (2) Demand that the CCP quickly send representatives to start talks with government representatives as soon as possible to seek comprehensive peace.</p>

<p>In addition to representatives from provincial and municipal councils and national professional groups, cultural groups, and women's groups, Wu Yuhao, Wu Zhesheng, Miao Diqing and other three representatives from the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, who received the telegram from the National Peace Promotion Association the day before yesterday morning, specially flew to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and arrived at the meeting place at 4:30 PM. Due to time constraints, only Wu Yuhao reported (see later). Mayors of universities and vocational schools in the city, including Ling Xianyang, Ou Yuanhuai, Liao Shicheng, Zhao Xiuhong, Lu Xirong, Wang Yukai, Hu Yongyi, Wang Suichang, Situ Bo, and Xia Daming, were also invited to participate in the conference yesterday afternoon and were warmly welcomed by the conference. The proceedings of the two conferences yesterday are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>The third general meeting of the National Peace Promotion Association was held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Zhou Xuexiang, Executive Director of the National Federation of Trade Unions, Wang Xiaoji, Chairman of the Business Federation, and Zhang Qiang, Speaker of the Zhejiang Provincial Council, who were jointly elected by the presidium of the conference. First, the presidium summarized the opinions of each person and asked the representatives to discuss the opinion on promoting peace at the conference item by item. As a result, it was resolved into two major demands and seven proposals.</p>
<h3>Revised Organizational Outline Passed; Directors to Be Assumed by the Presidium; First Meeting to Be Held Today</h3>
<p>The fourth general meeting was held from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Wang Lu, Deputy Speaker of the Nanjing Municipal Council, Tang Siyao, Deputy Speaker of the Beiping Municipal Council, and Lu Xiaodao, Executive Director of the National Women's Groups Federation. First, the draft of the organizational outline of the National Peace Promotion Association was discussed and passed by the conference with amendments. The original text is as follows: (1) This association is named the National Peace Promotion Association. (2) The task of this association is to unite the forces of the people of the whole country, promote comprehensive peace, and complete national unity. (3) This association is organized by one to three representatives from the following public opinion organs and groups: (A) Councils (or temporary councils) of each province and municipality directly under the central government.

<h3>Separate Telegrams to Both Parties Urging Peace</h3>
<p>Then the conference passed a motion to send separate telegrams to Acting President Li and Mr. Mao Zedong, calling for peace. The telegrams read as follows: Nanjing, Respectful Greetings to President Li, Yan'an, Respectful Greetings to Mr. Mao Runzhi and Gentlemen of the Chinese Communist Party: Since the eight-year War of Resistance, the strength of the people has been exhausted. Continuing with three years of internal strife, lives have been devastated. The people are haggard and groaning, not knowing where they will die. With tears in our eyes, we earnestly seek peace. This association has specially gathered representatives from provincial and municipal councils and national professional groups, cultural groups, and women's groups to hold a national peace promotion conference in Shanghai, which opened on February 12. After the resolution of the conference, two major demands and seven proposals were put forward: (already seen above, omitted.) Recorded in the minutes. In addition to separate telegrams of appeal, we hereby telegraphically request: (1) Please adopt and implement it as soon as possible (for the telegram to President Li). (2) Supervise and follow, respectfully hoping that you will consider the overall situation, care about the plight of the people, grant adoption, quickly cease fire, and send representatives to start talks with government representatives as soon as possible to seek comprehensive peace (for the telegram to Mr. Mao). All representatives of the National Peace Promotion Association respectfully kowtow.</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>Began at 6:30 PM. After the ceremony was performed as required, Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, served as chairman and read out the declaration of the conference. Liao Shicheng, acting president of Guanghua University, then made a brief speech on behalf of the university, stating: Recalling that since the establishment of the Republic of China, politics and military affairs have never been unified, causing the people to suffer. At present, peace is sought by everyone. We hope that both parties can seek it with the greatest sincerity, and they must take the will of the people as their will and the expectations of the people as their expectations. I hope that the National Peace Promotion Association will be successful so that the country and the nation can be prosperous and happy. The closing ceremony ended at about 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Peace Delegation Arrives in Shanghai; Reports on Trip to the North</h3>
<p>Wu Yujun, a representative of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, reported on the delegation's trip to the North, stating in brief: After arriving in Beiping, they were warmly received by the authorities. They rested on the first day, and the next afternoon, they were hosted at a banquet by the Joint Office. Seated with them were the mayor and deputy mayor of Beiping, as well as seven committee members. During the banquet, Mayor Ye Jianying spoke extensively, stating that if there were any peace negotiation proposals, they should first be clarified in writing so that preparations for explanations could be made. Starting at 7:00 PM on the 9th, General Ye Jianying spoke with us in batches until 2:00 AM. Unfortunately, many specific issues were evaded, stating that they had to be decided by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and that individuals could not make decisions. Regarding the issue of war criminals, I also expressed to Ye that the Chinese Communist Party was severely criticizing President Chiang Kai-shek, but I personally believed that President Chiang Kai-shek's "merits" outweighed his "faults" for China. Ye expressed agreement on this point, but also offered rebuttals.</p>
<h3>The Biggest Key to Peace Talks Lies in Eliminating Misunderstandings</h3>
<p>Based on what I saw, I believe that the biggest key to peace talks lies in eliminating misunderstandings. Furthermore, the Communist Party has no extraordinary origins, so the current situation has evolved due to our own lack of competitiveness. However, I believe that the Communist side has not underestimated the government's strength, nor does it have a fixed intention to fight to the end.</p>

<h3>No More National Flags on the Streets</h3>
<p>After Mr. Wu finished speaking, several representatives present at the meeting asked: (1) Why has the Chinese Communist Party not yet sent peace negotiation representatives? (2) After the Communist army entered Beiping, are national flags still seen on the streets? (3) Why did General Fu Zuoyi never meet with the delegation after all? (4) Why are news reporters not allowed to enter the city? Mr. Wu replied: (1) According to General Ye Jianying, the Chinese Communist Party wants to begin peace talks after Beiping is completely liberated. The so-called complete liberation likely refers to eliminating "Nationalist spies." They are currently actively investigating household registrations to prepare for this work. (2) National flags are no longer seen, and even the Kuomintang emblems on police hats have been removed. (3) The delegation originally intended to meet with General Fu, and we heard that General Fu had also agreed, but we never met after all, which is the biggest regret of this trip. (4) News reporters were not received because it is said that Beiping has only recently been "liberated," and everything has not yet returned to normal, so they hope that the press will postpone their visits.</p>
<h3>Qiu Zhizhong Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Qiu Zhizhong, a standing director of the China People's Peace Promotion Association, stated that the association had decided to relocate to Shanghai. He arrived here by car last night (the 14th). He met with reporters from this newspaper and informed them that there were many discrepancies in the news reports about the delegation in Beiping carried by Chinese and foreign newspapers, which had a significant impact. Therefore, corrections were issued. Now, seeing the Shanghai newspaper disseminating Mr. Wu's remarks, which seemed to have a tone of criticism, he felt compelled to offer a few more words of explanation: (1) When General Ye Jianying hosted us, Mr. Wu was barely speaking, so how could there be talk of private relations through direct telephone calls? (2) It only takes several people to deny a signature of one person, so why forge a seal? (3) Mr. Wu wanted to pay a visit to Acting President Li on the morning of the 14th, which contradicts the claim of a gathering at the Presidential Palace on the 12th and a summons at 3:00 PM on the 13th. (4) Whether Generals Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen are in Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) is questionable. Where did Mr. Wu see them? (5) The points Mr. Wu discussed with the Associated Press have a tone of disparagement and insult toward the Nationalist and Communist Parties, and he also deceived the compatriots in Jiangnan, which can be described as a slip of the tongue. (6) General Ye Jianying repeatedly explained to us that we must use the "Eight Articles" as the basis for negotiations, especially emphasizing the point of "reorganizing the army," and we heard no talk of concessions. (7) The Communist authorities adopted a purely explanatory attitude toward our delegation's call for peace. How could there be specific conditions to bring back and announce in a few days?</p>
<p>In short, the Peace Promotion Association was jointly formed by dozens of people's organizations and was originally intended to promote peace without fear of hardship, not to use it as a tool for speculation. Now, someone is arbitrarily publishing incorrect information, which affects the reputation of the organization, which is regrettable. If there are any more false statements or fabrications in the future, to save our time serving compatriots across the country, we will not waste our breath.</p>
<h3>31 Citizens Petition for Bail for Arrested Children</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Thirty-one citizens, including Huang Zhangshi, petitioned the National Peace Promotion Association yesterday to request bail for their arrested children.

Please follow the example of the capital, and base the family evacuation fees for civil servants in the capital on two months' salary, plus 1,000 yuan (which was equivalent to three months' salary at the time), and issue them according to the price index ratio at the time of payment so that they can evacuate their families and work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>(3) Employee Contingency Fees: Civil servants in the capital received contingency fees of three months' salary in January, plus 23,000 yuan (which was equivalent to thirteen months' salary for an appointed official). Please issue them according to the above base figure, according to the price index ratio at the time of payment, so that they can cope with emergencies.</p>

<h3>The National Bank Dumps Goods, Money Market Trends Tighten</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Central Bank has been dumping goods for days to stabilize prices.

The difference between the national banks and bureaus coming in and going out was 474.4 million yuan, and the difference for foreign banks was 26.7 million yuan. The money market is tight, and the unofficial interest rate is very high. The daily interest rate in the morning was 70 yuan per 1,000 yuan.

<h3>Overseas Remittance Income Declines</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper]: Overseas remittances have been suspended from listing for half a month now. During this period, overseas remittances are calculated based on the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, but the market price of transfer certificates is often at a low level. Even in the last two days, although the market has suddenly improved, it is still about 30% lower than the black market price, so overseas remittance income has decreased. This year, the daily overseas remittance income is only about US$10,000, while last year, after the implementation of the listing method, the daily income reached more than US$50,000. Therefore, if we want to increase the number of overseas remittances, the fundamental method must focus on the exchange rate.</p>

<h3>Tight Money - High Unofficial Interest Rates - Rice Prices Decline Across the Board - Oil and Grain Prices Fall Generally - Flour Plummets</h3>

Gaobu indica rice was 8,000 yuan, and Yinbai yuan rice fell by about 1,000 yuan, but all rice was still not traded at the limited price.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices turned downward. As the money market continued to tighten, cargo owners were selling off, and retailers were hesitant to enter the market.

Black sesame fell by 30%. Tea beans were the only ones that remained stable, while red sorghum and corn generally declined.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Stop Rising and Fall</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn merchants were reluctant to sell, sales were sluggish, and market prices were unsustainable, fluctuating and declining. The morning opened with 42-count Yefeng yarn at 510,000 yuan, but with the tight money market, buyers were unable to make progress, transactions became cold, and the trend suddenly became weak, ending at 495,000 yuan, a drop of 15,000 yuan. 32-count Yin Yue yarn fell all the way from 380,000 yuan to 360,000 yuan at the close, a drop of 40,000 yuan. 21-count Shuangma spot yarn initially stood at the 300,000 yuan mark, once rising to 320,000 yuan in the middle, but finally fell back to 296,000 yuan, a drop of 24,000 yuan. Factory orders were at 275,000 yuan, and arbitrage for one day was as high as 17,000 yuan. 20-count Shuangma was slightly quoted at 10,000 yuan. Other brands such as Jinxi and Jincheng also fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan each. All grades below 16-count were also sluggish.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth stopped rising and fell, because black and red were weakening, market sentiment was weak, and the money market was tight. Local customers had reached saturation and turned to a wait-and-see attitude. Merchants were eager to sell, and retailers were also less active, so the market turned flat and tired. Longtou fine cloth was initially quoted outside the market at 11,000 yuan, and rose again to 12,000 yuan at noon. Daily Longtou fine cloth rose from 9,100 yuan to a maximum of 10,200 yuan, closing at the 10,000 yuan mark, 500 yuan lower than the weekend. Laba heavy fine cloth traded at 10,600 yuan, Wufu fine cloth at 10,800 yuan, and Sijunzi yuan big cloth initially opened at a low of 9,800 yuan. Under the support of the surface, it once rose to 11,200 yuan, but finally fell back to 10,700 yuan, a drop of 650 yuan. Sijunzi yuan straight cloth was still active, but it was also 300 yuan lower than before. As for Shilin cloth and other colored cloths, the factory still opened at the original prices of the weekend.</p>
<h3>Estimated Amount of Cotton in Stock in This City</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper]: Since the war front is approaching day by day and the transportation lines are becoming narrower day by day, the supply of domestic cotton to the cotton mills in this city has virtually stopped. The largest source of foreign cotton supply, the US aid cotton of the Economic Cooperation Administration, has 300,000 bales that have been shipped to China in batches last year, and there are 100,000 bales remaining. The Economic Cooperation Administration has announced that it will stop shipping to China, which has a significant impact on the supply of raw cotton in this city. Moreover, due to the unstable situation, the foreign exchange earned by the yarn and cloth exported by the yarn mills in this city is used for ordering foreign cotton, and they all adopt a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>According to the survey, the current stock of cotton in the city is estimated to be sufficient for the mills to operate for two months. The monthly consumption of raw cotton by the city's yarn mills (including the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai areas) is about 150,000 dan. The national yarn mills need about 250,000 dan of raw cotton.</p>
