<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕政府派定與中共進行和談之代表團後，頃正靜待中共之答覆及指定地點，然後兼程前往，開始和談。聞政府爲表示謀求和談之誠意，除首先由政府代表團前往外，將考慮另組人民代表團前往。經發表爲政府代表團首席代表之邵力子，廿三日晨曾訪孫科院長，請辭首席名義，仍以代表身份，與各代表共同努力，孫氏當卽接受此項意見，對該項名義予以取消。又邵力子，鍾天心於廿三日夜車赴滬，彭昭賢則於廿三日晨赴滬，彼等均將開始與在滬各黨派人士交換意見，三數日內返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社南廿三日電」政府首要廿三日下午四時集會孫科院長官邸，商討有關進行和談諸問題，參加者李代總統·孫科·吳鐵城·吳忠信·邵力子·張治中·鍾天心。僉認關於進行和平商談之步驟應多聽取各方面之意見，當決定推邵力子·張治中二氏於廿三日晚去滬，訪問上海各方面人士，徽詢對於和平問題之意見。並悉，今日會談中曾就有關和談代表團事務有所商討，並推定鍾天心兼代表團秘書長，左恭爲副秘書長，鍾氏表示和談前途雖十分困難，但仍可相當樂觀。渠此次奉派與中共進行和平商談，，定當勉力以赴，渠相信無論政府或中共皆需要和平，故和談前途可以樂觀。</p>
<p>〔又電〕據息：政院政務會議通過派遣邵力子等五代表，與中共進行和談事，邵氏對首席代表名義堅辭，刻孫院長已同意取消該項名義。唯邵氏仍將以代表之一身份，參加和談。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿三日電〕此間政治活動今日甚爲沉寂，和談代表團正等待共黨答復。邵力子已赴上海，廿五日可返京，據談稱：預料廿四日或可獲得共方答復。彭昭賢現在上海，黃紹竑則尚未自漢來京。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿三日電〕和談代表團，廿三日晨曾會商行政院給予渠等之詳細指令及截至目前關於和談進展的全部報告，但內容則嚴守秘密。據悉：代表團面臨之一項重要問題，卽在如何執行政府最近宣布之同意以共黨提出之八項條件作爲開始談判之基礎之決定，而避免涉及可被解釋爲投降之行動，政府顯然熟望共黨願意作若干讓步。尚有一項待決之問題，卽爲代表團在談判中是否有法定問題之全權，抑必須將其所同意之各點向行政院請示。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕李代總統私人代表甘介侯（見圖）教授，昨日午後四時由京乘車抵滬，卽日分訪孫夫人·陳銘樞·張瀾·張君勳·羅隆基·黃炎培·章士釗諸氏，就政府目前進行和談完成和平之艱鉅任務上，徵求諸氏之意見，並將邀請渠等晋京，協助進行和談。李代總統並有分致各氏之函件，交甘氏帶滬（致孫夫人信附後）。甘教授本擬於前日乘飛快車來滬，因協助李代總統整理文告而延期，改乘當日夜車，又因京滬路車之嚴電誤點，至昨日午後四時始抵達，當晚卽拜訪諸氏，並定今日起正式進行洽商，定三四日內返京，離滬前並將代表當局邀請在滬療疾之何應欽氏尅日晋京，共商大計</p>
<p>甘氏接見記者時，曾對目前時勢有所闡述。謂李代總統素主張民主自由，在北平行轅任內處理學潮及其他種種事實，堪爲明證。目前之現實，爲非恢復和平不能恢復民主及保障自由，蔣總統決定引退後，曾召李氏談話三次，均堅不肯就，最後始體念時艱，出面維持，決心不顧一切困難，不惜任何犧牲，爲和平而努力，李氏對和平之獲致，具有信心，理由爲時至今日，不惟全國要求和平，卽中共亦表明需要和平矣。在未來之和談中，只要中共之條件不損害國家之獨立，使民主政治能實現，人權自由有保障，則什麼都可以談，其他概爲枝節問題。本人深信，代總統此項主張，一定能得全國人民之擁護及中共各黨派與愛好和平人民之贊助。記者詢以未來和平協定之可能內容，甘氏答稱：據個人推測條件當甚合理，因此乃國家人民之事，而非一黨一派之事，將來在洽商過程中，如能由孫夫人出面指導協助，則對和平之獲致，可有決定性之影響，其他愛好和平人士如能羣策羣力，則和平之成功，必有更大之機會。甘氏最後並透露：政府除派出和平使者外，與中共間非正式之接觸，亦將於日內建立。</p>

<h3 id="c13">黃金公債成敗的關鍵 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>自從幣制改革失敗以後，社會經濟的動盪，日益加劇：政府針對逐步演變的情勢，曾頒布了各種補救的措施。但是，這一連串的補偏救弊的辦法—從幣改補充辦法到存兌金銀—都只是頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚的作法，似乎幷沒有一種週密的計劃和澈底的決心。其結果只是揚湯止沸，使經濟危機益趨惡化，尤其是存兌金銀，更引起了聲個社會秩序爲之騷動的慘劇。因此，政府被迫不得不再作全盤的考慮，政策上又作了一個一百八十度的轉向，於十六日的政院會議中毅然停止存兌金銀，同時幷通過了黃金短期公債發行的條例。</p>
<p>黃金公債，說來幷不是什麽新辦法。人們一提起，就會聯想到遠在抗戰期間政府在重慶實施的黃金儲蓄和美金同盟勝利公債，以及勝利以後所發行的美金公債和美金庫券等辦法。政府此次之採用黃金爲公債本位，其用意也和歷次的採用美金，初無二致。顯然的，在這通貨不斷膨脹的局面之下，要人民願意拿錢出來貢獻給國家，只有用黃金或外幣來作標準，才能使人民的債權獲得保陣，從而樂於解囊購債。有些人或許要說，政府對於財政的政策，兜來兜去，始終是跳不出這一套老圈子。但是，不管老辦法也好，新辦法也好，我們覺得發行公債總算是國家理財消極方面的一種比較最妥善的辦法，運用得好，要比增稅或其他不合理的征歛方法來得平允無弊，因爲這種辦法的對象是在於吸收國民有餘的財富的。因此，我們對於政府這一措施，雖然有過去屢次失敗的例子在，還是衷心的擁護·也正因爲衷心擁護和過去失敗的例子，而感覺到有幾句心所謂危的話，不能不在這條例頒布之始說出來。</p>
<p>政府此次發行公債的宗旨，也正如過去發行外幣的那一套，有如該條例第一條所說是在於「獎勵儲蓄，吸收游資，穩定金融，平衡預算。」就過去歷次發行外幣公債的情形看來，我們覺得每一次的成績都未臻理想。換言之，即政府幷沒有能達成上面所說的各種目標。在政府看來，或許要怪人民不能與政府合作，對於政府的政策不能竭誠擁護，以致推行未能順利。但是，就人民的立塲來說，政策每次都不免出爾反爾，自失信用，使人民不敢對它亳無保留的拿出信心來。每次發行的時候，政府總是三番五次的昭申大信，一到後來，辦法屢改，面目全非。徒使竭誠擁護的人，莫不大受損失，而徘徊顧望的人，反倒可以僥倖少上一次當。這樣一來，自然難望有完滿的成績。試檢討過去的情形··說黃金備蓄吧，原是說十足兌現的，後來却打了一個六折；說美金公債吧，原是說以原幣還本付息的，却因外幣禁止持有的法令而打銷了，說美金庫券吧，原是說按央行公佈的平衡費率還本付息的，却因平衡委會的撤銷而辦法變更了。每一次法令的變更，吃虧的總是人民。政府原意是要拿外幣來保障人民的債權，不料幾變之後，保障竟落了空，外幣竟好像成了誘騙人民的一種幌子，又那能叫人民放心來擁護呢！</p>
<p>因此，我們認爲政府這次發行黃金公債，若要期望它能達成理想的目標，必須以過去歷次的失敗爲借鏡，要下最大決心澈底的把決策之處矯正過來。矯正的辦法，應從以下的兩點着眼·第一，政府對於十六日公佈的公債條例，一定要堅定不移的予以維持，絕對不應該辦法　更，朝令夕改，即使在政府蒙受損失的情形之下，也不能只打自己的算盤，而忽略了人民的利益。如此，政府的威信才能樹立，政策自然容易推行。第二，政府對於過去的公債，尤應盡力設法予以整理，原定辦法，雖或已與後來的政令抵觸，不能實施，但是變更法令是政府自身的矛盾，人民是無辜的，政府總要另謀種不背原意的合理辦法，以圖保障因擁護政策而無故蒙受損失的人民的債權利益。這樣一來，對於新債的推行將更有事半功倍之效。</p>
<p>記得徐部長就任財長之初，在海上首次記者招待會中，會公開表示今後要努力於幣信和債信的建立。當時曾引起全國人民的良好的反響和熱誠的期望。這次停止存兌金銀，報載徐部長也曾向政院會議中抗言力爭，以爲不可失信於人民，雖然屈於眾議，主張未伸，但已可表明徐部長對於立「信」的問題的重視。現在幣信的重建似乎已因政令的屢變而遭遇挫折，我們希望債信的重建不要遭受同樣的命運。因此特地提出上面的兩點意見，以供當局的採納。</p>

<p>〔合衆社新德里廿三日電〕印度總理尼赫魯廿三日結束十九國亞洲會議時，預測此會將引進遠東人民合作之新時代。大會通過決議，向安理會建議解法印尼問題方針後，召開全體大會，宣告閉幕。尼赫魯致詞稱：全球應明瞭「亞洲希望在世界事務上有一席地，並決意如此做。」渠稱，此會乃「亞洲國家間更密切合作之前奏。」又稱，除印印尼問題外，「吾人之思想興趣尚有更大之規範。」尼氏以大會主席身份稱：「吾人中有多人欲討論其他問題」，（指阿刺伯國家之欲討論巴勒斯坦）然大會祗以印尼問題爲限，實乃明智之舉。再稱，本次會議之決議，有助於其他方面之合作。菲列賓代表羅慕洛，號召組織永久之汎亞洲機構，四座報以掌聲。渠稱：「數世紀束縛後，亞洲正拋去鍊索而爭取自由權力。吾人宜共助亞洲爭得新世界中之合理地位」。尼·羅兩人外，尚有埃及之凱末爾具及伊期之慕利發言。兩人均盛讀大會之成就，堪爲世界和平之大助。</p>

<h3 id="c83">南通糧食之謎 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者叢永樞</p>
<p>〔本報南通十八日訊〕蘇北的米，大部份出產在裏下河一帶，南通却是個米糧不足自給的縣份。南通濱江帶海，是一個棉產地區，而食米却需要靠別處供給的。</p>
<p>在戰前，南通還可算是蘇北米糧的一個轉運口。每年中秋前後，泰縣·東台·姜埝·曲塘·海安一帶的新穀登塲時，從如臯到南通的運鹽河上，便斷續的航起一隊一隊運米南來的帆船，南通是從來不鬧糧荒的。而几啓·海·江南一帶的食米，也有從這裏轉運過去的。縣城西北十五華里的唐閘鎭，是一個工業中心，也是糧食中心，寬闊的河而，常停滿了糧船，景况是相當熱鬧的。可是，復員以來，就從沒有再見過這樣的塲面。蘇北的產米地區，大半地方不靖，交通不便，每年雖然照常在那裏產米，可是，再也沒有那樣多的白米裝運過來了。</p>
<p>勝利以後，南通的食糧大宗依賴着江南供應。</p>
<p>本縣農民卽使種一點，也多留給自己吃，很少賣出來。南通以北的如皋境，產米比較多，可是，這年頭能控制的地區很有限，供應外縣的數量也便很少。泰縣·姜埝·曲塘一帶的米，很難直接運來南通，大多是先運到江南無錫一帶脫手，打一個轉身，再由南通糧商從無錫購運過來。</p>
<p>因此，一個位置在產糧區邊緣的縣份，糧價反要比轉運都市（如無錫）高。然而，南通的糧價不僅是高而已，而且高得畸形·無錫七百元一石，上海八百元一石時，南通是一千四百元一石·無錫八百元一石，上海一千元一石時，南通是二千元一石。最高峯時，無錫一千二百元，上海一千四百八十元，南通的米價是二千八百元。一般看起來，大概比上海高出約二分之一。這樣畸形的高價，主要原因在於運輸困難，另外，當然也不免有不肖商人有意抬高市價。</p>
<p>早在十二月初，就有糧商在無錫集體採購食米，可是，因爲江南港口封鎖，尤其黃甸港封鎖後，米船被阻於江陰，無法通過，更促成糧價的上揚。於是通·滬問的輪船上，販米的單帮客便特別多了。一個人，用四隻麵粉袋裝一石米，從上海過江帶到南通來，馬上便可賺一千元，約合洋紗一小包，滬是一件很方便的事，所以連日輪船上的來客便顯得特別擁擠。</p>
<p>滯留在江陰的近萬担食米，經過了一個多月的躭延，費了許多手續交涉，總算運回來了。照理說，米價可以依照指揮所經濟處以前所擬訂的辦法，照無錫米價，加上應有的運費和利潤，每石米價應是無錫米價的一又十分之二。可是，據說運轍這批米的費用是相當驚人的。八千石米運到，糧價是見疲敝了，可是，無錫，上海却先南通而報疲，可見南通米市之疲，不一定爲的是這一批食米運到。果然，隔不到兩天，米價重又回升了。</p>
<p>新任黃縣長對南通糧價也感到非常奇怪。一江之隔，竟把糧價抬高到一倍以上。在記者招待會上，黃縣長曾談到這個問題。他說：看到糧價的日漲夜大，已收賦款雖不多，却無形吃苦不少，於是乃計劃赴江南購糧，正好指揮所令飭購糧存儲，於是便撥中央及省級款一百九十萬元，又向縣庫借五十萬元，凑了二百四十萬元，向江南採購。有人說：政府購糧，在配售給公教人員，黃縣長說：「不能這樣說。因爲公教人員甚多，而購糧有限，到底配給誰，不配給誰呢？」</p>
<p>據黃縣長說：購糧的作用在試一試，看看沿途運輸的情形怎麽樣？費用需多少。因爲，現在政府等於是瞎子，只好聽商人喊價，如果抑低，他們說要虧本，硬要抑，他們便不賣，那要引起糧荒的。不過，如果說因政府購糧運到，糧商跟政府開個玩笑，而使南通米價下跌，那就不僅公教人員沾光，就是一般老百姓也可以吃到便宜米了。黃縣長感慨地說：「其實，老百姓吃了便宜米，又有誰懂得政府的意思？有人也許要笑政府蝕了方呢！」黃縣長又說：「如果不然的話，至少可以知道運輸的難易和費用的多少，對於糧商的話，不再是個瞎子。至於這筆款，也不致受到幣值下跌的影響。」這是一個很好的計劃，希望能順利進行。</p>
<p>九日十日連續在廣閘發生的和囤風潮（參看十四日太報第七版），也就是因米價過高而起。往例是這樣，大生紗廠發工資時，工人得了錢便買米買紗，米跟紗也就因一時銷路特旺，價格便俏俏上去。而南通的工資，一般都是依照上海生活指數計算的。這裏旣沒有配給品，而一班物價又較上海高，比起來，同樣的工資，而購買力却薄弱得多了。和囤案發生後，南通指揮所，縣府都非常注意，曾先後會商善後辦法：一面由商會儘量抑低糧價，一面廠方也沒法改善工人待遇，彌補生活指數的差異。對於肇事份子將加以偵緝，嚴予懲處，對於被損的商號，設法貸款使能繼續營業。事件幸經妥善處理，就此而止，沒有擴大。</p>
<p>南通現在所期待的是糧源暢通，祗要來源通了，購運方便，大小行商都可往江南採購，米源充沛，糧價自然不會有畸形發展的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Important Gathering at President Sun's Official Residence: Discussing Peace Negotiation Issues; Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong to be Sent to Shanghai to Solicit Opinions from Various Parties; People's Representative Delegation Also Under Consideration <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 23rd] After the government designated the delegation to conduct peace negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), it is now quietly awaiting the CCP's response and designated location before proceeding with all haste to begin the negotiations. It is said that, to express its sincerity in seeking peace, the government, in addition to first sending the government delegation, will consider forming another people's representative delegation to go as well. Shao Lizi, who was announced as the chief representative of the government delegation, visited President Sun Ke on the morning of the 23rd to request resignation from the position of chief, remaining as a representative to work together with the other representatives. Sun immediately accepted this suggestion and canceled the title. Furthermore, Shao Lizi and Zhong Tianxin left for Shanghai on the night train of the 23rd, while Peng Zhaoxian left for Shanghai on the morning of the 23rd. They will all begin exchanging opinions with people from various parties in Shanghai and will return to Nanjing in a few days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Government leaders convened at President Sun Ke's official residence at 4 PM on the 23rd to discuss issues related to conducting peace negotiations. Participants included Acting President Li, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Wu Zhongxin, Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhong Tianxin. They all agreed that more opinions should be heard from all sides regarding the steps to conduct peace talks. It was decided to send Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong to Shanghai on the evening of the 23rd to visit people from all sectors in Shanghai and inquire about their opinions on the peace issue. It was also learned that the meeting today discussed matters related to the peace negotiation delegation, and Zhong Tianxin was appointed as the secretary-general of the delegation, with Zuo Gong as the deputy secretary-general. Zhong expressed that although the prospect of peace negotiations is very difficult, it can still be reasonably optimistic. He said that he will do his best to conduct peace negotiations with the CCP and believes that both the government and the CCP need peace, so the prospect of peace negotiations is optimistic.</p>
<p>[Another Cable] According to sources: The Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting passed the resolution to dispatch Shao Lizi and other five representatives to conduct peace negotiations with the CCP. Shao firmly declined the title of chief representative, and President Sun has agreed to cancel the title. However, Shao will still participate in the peace negotiations as one of the representatives.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] Political activities here were very quiet today, and the peace negotiation delegation is awaiting a response from the Communist Party. Shao Lizi has gone to Shanghai and is expected to return to Nanjing on the 25th. He said that he anticipates receiving a response from the Communist side possibly on the 24th. Peng Zhaoxian is currently in Shanghai, while Huang Shaohong has not yet arrived in Nanjing from Wuhan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] The peace negotiation delegation met on the morning of the 23rd to discuss the detailed instructions given to them by the Executive Yuan and the complete report on the progress of the peace negotiations to date, but the contents are kept strictly confidential. It is reported that one of the important issues facing the delegation is how to implement the government's recently announced decision to agree to the eight conditions proposed by the Communist Party as the basis for starting negotiations, while avoiding actions that could be interpreted as surrender. The government apparently hopes that the Communist Party will be willing to make some concessions. Another outstanding issue is whether the delegation has full authority on legal issues in the negotiations, or whether it must submit any points agreed upon to the Executive Yuan for instructions.</p>

(2) The CCP's military victories are progressing steadily, and they firmly believe that China will achieve complete "liberation" within this year. (3) Accusing "American imperialism" of plotting to cultivate opposition organizations within the "revolutionary camp" and "instructing the Nanjing reactionary group to launch a peace offensive in order to buy time." (4) Emphasizing that "the revolution must be carried through to the end," opposing compromise, and demanding "the merciless destruction of" "the false peace offensive orchestrated by Jiang and the Americans." (5) Within the "People's Democratic Front," "there is no room for an opposition to stand, nor is there any room for the so-called middle road." (6) Accusing President Jiang's New Year's Day message of being "deceptive," opposing coordination and complacency, and emphasizing that "whoever is complacent and allows the enemy to escape, causing the great cause of the revolution to fall short, will be a sinner of the Chinese revolution and a sinner of the nation." (7) Supporting Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions. The statement also stated: "We want to create a free way of life where the people are the masters and the highest possible standard of living."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Junmai, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters yesterday that he welcomes Acting President Li's proclamation and particularly agrees with the proclamation's declaration to revoke and cease all laws and actions that restrict people's freedom and are inconsistent with democratic principles. Zhang said: "I hope that local governments will immediately and effectively implement this, allowing opposition parties to resume activities, suspended newspapers and periodicals to resume publication, and detained political prisoners to be released, which will greatly benefit the realization of peace." Yesterday was Zhang's sixty-third birthday, and many of Zhang's friends and students went to his residence in Fan Garden to offer congratulations.</p>

He said that Li will also consider rescinding the decree dissolving the Democratic League. He also said that measures such as a general amnesty for political prisoners nationwide (including university students), the abolition of laws restricting freedom of the press and human rights, the abolition of the Special Criminal Tribunal, and the abolition of martial law are all under consideration. He said that these measures will be implemented in the near future to lay the foundation for further major political and economic reforms. All left-wing newspapers and magazines are expected to resume publication in the short term. Li's verbal order to release Zhang and Yang is expected to be followed by a written order immediately.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xikou, 23rd] After returning to his hometown, President Jiang stayed at the tomb hut of his mother yesterday. This morning, he went to Xikou Street, walked slowly along the stream, and gazed at the scenery on the opposite bank with leisure. At 10:00 AM, he led Chiang Ching-kuo to visit his mother's tomb. Afterwards, he went to Wuling School for worship, and more than fifty other religious believers also participated. At around 5:00 PM, the President visited the Wuling Farm and then went to the old house in the town to meet with his clansmen, feeling very affectionate.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Beiping Office, 7:30 PM, 23rd] After the signing of the Beiping Armistice Agreement, the joint office organizations of both sides are actively consulting on the organization. It is reported that it has been generally decided that internal departments will be set up for military affairs, politics, finance, industry and commerce, culture and education, and municipal administration. According to unconfirmed news, the candidates for the National Army side may include Fu Zuoyi, Deng Baoshan, and Zhao Pilian, while the candidates for the Communist side may include Ye Jianying, Xu Bing (the Communist side announced Xu as the Deputy Mayor of Beiping, formerly the Communist side's advisor to the Military Mediation Department), and Xue Zizheng (formerly the Communist side's Chief of Staff to the Military Mediation Department). The joint organization will be located in Zhongnanhai.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Beiping Office, 8:00 PM, 23rd] Well-informed sources say that the ceasefire agreement between the North China military authorities and the Communist army was previously approved by the Nanjing Central Government. In addition, after the Beiping issue is resolved, people in North China are paying attention to the Taiyuan and Suiyuan issues. Yan Xishan currently has a representative in Beiping, and Sui Chairman Dong Qiwu has also come to Beiping. It is reported that the above two issues are being negotiated in Beiping.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Beiping Office, 4:45 PM, 23rd] The National Army in the city of Beiping began to transfer to Huangcun in the south and Huangsi in the north on the 22nd, and continued to leave the city on the 23rd. It is reported that the entire transfer will be completed outside the city on the 24th. After 9:00 PM last night, sporadic gunshots were heard in the east. It is reported that a certain unit of the National Army clashed with a Communist army outpost. The military authorities did not explain the truth of the incident, but said that it would not affect the overall situation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi is now planning to go to Taiyuan and Datong in person to deploy local peace matters there. It is widely rumored that Ye Chuangying is already inside the city of Beiping, but his friends say that he is expected to arrive today. Many believe that Beiping is the location of future political consultations, and the new government will also be located here. Landlords believe that there are rare goods to be had and are asking high prices.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] A Communist army regiment of about 2,000 to 3,000 people quietly entered the city tonight. The newly established joint office ordered the suspension of commercial flights in and out, but in accordance with the armistice agreement, government air force planes have been used to evacuate senior officials and secret service personnel, as well as other people who wish to move south.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] Beiping was peaceful throughout the day today, which has not been the case since the Communist army began its siege on December 14th of last year. A large number of National Army troops marched out of the city last night and this morning, and it is expected that the withdrawal will be completed by midnight today. Food prices have fallen by 25% compared to yesterday, and people are greatly relieved.

<p>[Report from Our Guangzhou Office, 23rd] Military and political figures here have been busy urging Xue Yue to come.

<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 23rd] Although the Communist army north of the Yangtze River has approached the Yangtze River, Nanjing remains as peaceful as usual on the 23rd. At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, and Zhang Yaoming, Commander of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, jointly convened a meeting at the National Assembly Hall, summoning the heads of all military, police, and gendarmerie units in the city for instructions. Gu Zhutong, Chief of the General Staff, was also invited to participate. Tang first explained that the President's retirement was actually an act of forbearance for the sake of the country, but the government's consistent policy will not be affected by this, hoping that everyone will work with peace of mind. Gu then delivered instructions, stating briefly: The security agencies in Nanjing must unite sincerely under the leadership of Commander Zhang Yaoming and must not slacken their organization and unity due to the retirement of leader Jiang. Although Jiang has retired, he still has the nation and the people in mind. Therefore, he had already given separate instructions on the united struggle of the national party, government, and military as early as a month ago. We should follow the spirit of obeying the leadership of leader Jiang and cope with the current transitional period of crisis, so as to strive for a bright future for the party and the country. At present, the defensive strength of the National Army on the Nanjing-Shanghai line has been greatly strengthened, which is why we seek to comply with the established policy of preparing for war and seeking peace. Finally, Commander Zhang Yaoming gave instructions, and Zhang gave important instructions on maintaining the security of Nanjing, and especially emphasized that the military, police, and gendarmerie should unite and stabilize order to overcome the current difficulties. (News about Tang Enbo's arrival in Shanghai is published on the fourth page)</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Professor Gan Jiehou (see picture), the personal representative of Acting President Li, arrived in Shanghai by car at 4:00 PM yesterday. He immediately visited Madam Sun, Chen Mingshu, Zhang Lan, Zhang Junxun, Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Shizhao, and others to solicit their opinions on the government's current arduous task of conducting peace negotiations and achieving peace, and will invite them to go to Nanjing to assist in the peace negotiations. Acting President Li also sent separate letters to each person, which Gan brought to Shanghai (the letter to Madam Sun is attached below). Professor Gan had originally planned to take the express train to Shanghai the day before yesterday, but was delayed due to assisting Acting President Li in organizing the proclamation. He changed to taking the night train that day, but was delayed again due to the Beijing-Shanghai railway train's telegram delays, and only arrived at 4:00 PM yesterday. He visited everyone that evening and scheduled to start consultations formally today, returning to Nanjing in three or four days. Before leaving Shanghai, he will also represent the authorities in inviting He Yingqin, who is in Shanghai for medical treatment, to go to Nanjing in the near future to discuss major plans together.</p>
<p>When Gan met with reporters, he elaborated on the current situation. He said that Acting President Li has always advocated democracy and freedom, and the way he handled student movements and other facts during his tenure at the Peiping Pacification Headquarters is clear evidence. The current reality is that democracy and freedom cannot be restored without restoring peace. After President Jiang decided to retire, he called Li three times to talk, but Li firmly refused to take the position. Finally, he considered the difficulties of the times and came forward to maintain the situation, determined to make efforts for peace regardless of all difficulties and at any sacrifice. Li has confidence in the attainment of peace because, up to this day, not only the whole country demands peace, but the CCP has also expressed its need for peace. In the future peace negotiations, as long as the CCP's conditions do not harm the independence of the country, enable the realization of democratic politics, and guarantee human rights and freedom, then everything can be discussed, and other things are minor issues. I firmly believe that the Acting President's proposal will definitely be supported by the people of the whole country and supported by the CCP parties and peace-loving people. When asked by reporters about the possible content of the future peace agreement, Gan replied: According to personal speculation, the conditions should be very reasonable, because it is a matter of the country and the people, not a matter of one party or one faction. In the future consultation process, if Madam Sun can come forward to guide and assist, it can have a decisive impact on the attainment of peace. If other peace-loving people can contribute their efforts, then the success of peace will have a greater chance. Gan finally revealed: In addition to sending peace envoys, informal contact between the government and the CCP will also be established within days.</p>
<p>Acting President Li's Letter to Madam Sun</p>
<p>Madam Sun, with respect, Mr. Jiang has resolutely retired, and I, based on my personal responsibility to the country, have had to come forward to reluctantly maintain the current situation. The civil war has been going on for years, and the people are suffering terribly. Stopping the war and seeking peace has become the unanimous call of the whole country. I am determined to follow the public opinion and do my best. However, this matter is of great importance, and especially relies on Madam to come out and lead, and jointly plan the progress, so that peace can be realized as soon as possible. The country and the people are deeply grateful. I hereby specially ask my brother Gan Jiehou to go to your place to express my humble feelings. I beg you to give instructions so that I can follow them, and please come to Nanjing immediately so that I can receive your teachings at any time. I especially pray for your blessings. I will show you my respect and ask for safety, Li Zongren respectfully, January 22.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] The matter of Madam Sun re-entering politics is generally considered to be very slim, because not long ago, Madam Sun told the Associated Press that under no circumstances would she accept any position in any government in China.</p>
<p>Luo Longji, Who is Receiving Medical Treatment in Shanghai, is Optimistic About the Prospect of Peace</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Luo Longji of the Democratic League said yesterday that he is quite optimistic about the prospect of peace. He also expressed his hope that "there will be concrete steps and methods for development, so that peace can be realized as soon as possible." Luo has been receiving treatment for lung disease in Shanghai for more than a year. Although his health has greatly improved, Luo said that it will be difficult to be discharged from the hospital in the short term for the sake of complete recovery. Luo is now being tested by doctors with injections of "Dihydro Streptomycine" [sic]. This medicine is the latest invention in the United States for lung disease and has only been on the market in the United States for three months. It is said to be more effective than "Penicillin" and "PAS".</p>

<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 23rd] Most of the National Army in Chuxian retreated all day today. By 9:00 PM, only a few garrison troops remained in the city. In order to comply with the government's peace-seeking policy, the National Army is constantly withdrawing south. The Communist army, closely following behind, from the Huainan and Huaibei Independent Brigades, fills in the gaps whenever the National Army withdraws from a place. It is reported that Chuxian is bound to be abandoned tonight and retreated to the south bank of the Chu River, as planned by the National Army. At present, in addition to using two brigades from Huainan and Huaibei as vanguards, four of the eight columns of Chen Yi's troops have also arrived in the Tianchang area north of Luhe County, in the Qiu Ling villages, and the other four columns are moving south along the Tianjin-Pukou Line.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Puzhen Office, 23rd] After the National Army destroyed the Five-Hole Railway Bridge north of Shaheji on the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway on the 21st, the Communist army advancing south along the railway was blocked on the north bank of the Shahe River. On the night of the 22nd, two columns, the 27th, of the Communist army on the right flank, moving from Yutai Ancient City towards Laian, bypassed the side and back of Shaheji via Huangnigang and Baishuitang. At the same time, thousands of local Communists in the Outang area southeast of Dingyuan also harassed the Qingshandun area northwest of Chuxian.

<h3 id="e13">The Key to Success or Failure of the Gold Bond <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Since the failure of currency reform, social and economic turmoil has intensified. The government has promulgated various remedial measures to address the evolving situation. However, this series of stopgap measures—from supplementary currency reform measures to the deposit and exchange of gold and silver—seem to lack a comprehensive plan and thorough determination. The result is merely treating the symptoms, exacerbating the economic crisis. In particular, the deposit and exchange of gold and silver caused a tragedy that stirred up social order. Therefore, the government was forced to reconsider the overall situation and made a 180-degree turn in policy, resolutely stopping the deposit and exchange of gold and silver at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 16th, and simultaneously passing the regulations for the issuance of short-term gold bonds.</p>
<p>Speaking of gold bonds, it is not a new method. People will immediately associate it with the gold savings and US dollar Allied Victory Bonds implemented by the government in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War, as well as the US dollar bonds and US dollar treasury bills issued after the victory. The government's use of gold as the benchmark for bonds this time is no different from the previous use of US dollars. Obviously, in this situation of continuous currency inflation, to get people to willingly contribute money to the country, only using gold or foreign currency as the standard can ensure the protection of people's creditor's rights, thereby making them happy to contribute and purchase bonds. Some people may say that the government's fiscal policy has been going around in circles and has always been unable to escape this old routine. However, regardless of whether it is an old method or a new method, we feel that issuing bonds is a relatively appropriate method in the passive aspect of national financial management. If used well, it is fairer and less prone to abuse than increasing taxes or other unreasonable levies, because the object of this method is to absorb the surplus wealth of the people. Therefore, although there have been repeated failures in the past, we wholeheartedly support this measure of the government. Precisely because of this heartfelt support and the examples of past failures, we feel that there are a few words of concern that must be spoken at the beginning of the promulgation of these regulations.</p>
<p>The purpose of the government's issuance of bonds this time, just like the previous issuance of foreign currency bonds, as stated in Article 1 of the regulations, is to "encourage savings, absorb idle funds, stabilize finance, and balance the budget." Looking at the previous issuances of foreign currency bonds, we feel that the results of each time have not been ideal. In other words, the government has not been able to achieve the various goals mentioned above. In the government's view, it may blame the people for not cooperating with the government and for not wholeheartedly supporting the government's policies, resulting in the failure of smooth implementation. However, from the people's perspective, policies inevitably go back on their word and lose credibility, making people afraid to give it their full confidence. Every time they are issued, the government always makes repeated solemn promises, but later, the methods are changed repeatedly and become unrecognizable. It only causes those who wholeheartedly support it to suffer great losses, while those who hesitate and look around can fortunately avoid being fooled once. In this way, it is naturally difficult to expect complete results. Examining the past situation...speaking of gold reserves, it was originally said to be fully redeemable, but later it was discounted by 40%; speaking of US dollar bonds, it was originally said to be repayable with the original currency and interest, but it was canceled due to the law prohibiting the holding of foreign currency; speaking of US dollar treasury bills, it was originally said to be repayable with the exchange rate announced by the Central Bank, but the method was changed due to the abolition of the Stabilization Committee. Every time the laws are changed, it is always the people who suffer. The government originally intended to use foreign currency to protect the people's creditor's rights, but after several changes, the protection fell through, and foreign currency seemed to become a guise for luring the people. How can people feel at ease and support it!</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that if the government wants to achieve the desired goals with this issuance of gold bonds, it must learn from the past failures and make the greatest determination to thoroughly correct the decision-making process. The method of correction should focus on the following two points: First, the government must firmly maintain the bond regulations announced on the 16th and absolutely should not change the methods, changing orders in the morning and evening. Even in the event that the government suffers losses, it cannot only consider its own interests and ignore the interests of the people. In this way, the government's prestige can be established, and policies will naturally be easier to implement. Second, the government should do its best to organize past bonds. Although the original methods may conflict with later government orders and cannot be implemented, changing the laws is the government's own contradiction. The people are innocent. The government must find another reasonable method that does not violate the original intention to protect the creditor's rights and interests of the people who have suffered losses due to supporting the policies. In this way, the promotion of new debts will be more effective with half the effort.</p>
<p>I remember that when Minister Xu first took office as Minister of Finance, he publicly stated at his first press conference at sea that he would strive to establish currency and debt credit in the future. At that time, it aroused good reactions and enthusiastic expectations from the people of the country. This time, the cessation of the deposit and exchange of gold and silver, according to reports, Minister Xu also argued and fought for it in the Executive Yuan meeting, believing that it was impossible to lose faith in the people. Although he succumbed to the majority opinion and his proposal was not extended, it can be shown that Minister Xu attaches great importance to the issue of establishing "credit." Now, the reconstruction of currency credit seems to have encountered setbacks due to repeated changes in government orders. We hope that the reconstruction of debt credit will not suffer the same fate. Therefore, we specifically put forward the above two opinions for the authorities to adopt.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, this city] According to relevant sources: Chen Lifu resigned from his position as a political commissar to President Sun on the 22nd and left Beijing to return home.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang resolutely resigned. He did not participate in the meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 22nd to decide on sending peace talk representatives. On the 22nd, he submitted another memorial to President Sun to request his resignation, stating in the original memorial: "I have carefully examined that the advancement and retreat of political officials should be based on policy. When Zhenggang was ordered to participate in the Executive Yuan, he stated at the meeting of the Central Political Committee of our party that if the government changes its policy towards the Communist Party, please allow Zhenggang the freedom to withdraw from the Executive Yuan at any time, and it has been recorded. Now, the Executive Yuan's policy has changed since Zhenggang's participation. Because he had previously requested to resign in person, he was not approved. The Executive Yuan's overall resignation was also not approved. Zhenggang is based on his usual understanding and in accordance with the above statement, he still requests to resign from his concurrent positions as Minister of Social Affairs of the Political Committee. Now, he submits this memorial for your consideration and approval, and to expedite the decision on the selection of a successor so that the handover can be completed immediately, awaiting orders." To show his determination, Gu Zhenggang still went to the ministry on the 23rd to oversee and expedite the handover.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Changsha, 23rd] Cheng Qian made a written statement to reporters late at night on the 22nd, saying: Since President Chiang announced his retirement, various parties have asked for opinions on the current situation. I believe that President Chiang's retirement is a powerful expression of the national people's demand for peace, and is extremely admirable. However, when we look back at the biggest mistakes in the past, it was actually the political measures that opposed the people's livelihood ideology. In the future, no matter what the peace talks process is, it is not a local issue, and the political policy of our province is only to implement the two major tasks of production cooperation and rent restriction and land restriction of the people's livelihood economy. I have said this repeatedly. As for opening up the four freedoms of speech, publishing freedom, and releasing political prisoners, it is my consistent proposition, because the people should have their natural absolute freedom in politics. However, it is found that there have been no political prisoners in this province in the past six months, and freedom of speech and publication is also very free. Today, everything should take the interests of the people as the premise, and the will of the people is the highest principle of politics. No matter how turbulent the situation is, my propositions are based on this.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Chengdu, 23rd] All national representatives from Sichuan, Kang, and Chongqing stationed in Chengdu to establish a Supervisory Committee. All Sichuan mass organizations, etc., today sent telegrams to President Chiang for his retirement for the country, expressing their admiration, and to Acting President Li for his support, hoping to conduct peace talks and reform all government affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e39">After the General Assembly Passed Three Resolutions, the Asian Conference Successfully Concluded. Nehru, Romulo, and Others Delivered Closing Remarks. The Dutch Side Expressed Inability to Accept the Security Council's Four-Nation Proposal. <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 23rd] Indian Prime Minister Nehru concluded the nineteen-nation Asian Conference on the 23rd, predicting that it would usher in a new era of cooperation among the people of the Far East. After the General Assembly passed a resolution recommending a solution to the Indonesian issue to the Security Council, it convened a plenary session and declared the conference closed. Nehru stated in his address that the world should understand that "Asia hopes to have a seat in world affairs and is determined to do so." He called the conference "a prelude to closer cooperation among Asian nations." He further stated that, in addition to the Indonesian issue, "our thoughts and interests encompass a broader scope." As Chairman of the conference, Nehru stated, "Many of us wanted to discuss other issues" (referring to the Arab states' desire to discuss Palestine), but it was wise that the conference limited itself to the Indonesian issue. He added that the resolutions of this conference would contribute to cooperation in other areas. Philippine representative Romulo called for the establishment of a permanent pan-Asian organization, which was met with applause. He stated, "After centuries of bondage, Asia is casting off its chains and striving for freedom and power. We should jointly help Asia gain its rightful place in the new world." In addition to Nehru and Romulo, Egypt's Kemal and Iraq's Mulla also spoke. Both praised the achievements of the conference as a great contribution to world peace.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 23rd] Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in his closing address at the Asian Conference today that he firmly believed the Security Council would appreciate their approach. Nehru continued, "I want to reiterate that our meeting here is not hostile to any country or group of countries, not even to the Netherlands, which has treated Indonesia unfairly. We believe that, even from the Dutch point of view, this unfair treatment must be corrected, as evil causes will produce evil consequences." Nehru concluded, "Europe and Africa have historically occupied important positions, and undoubtedly will continue to do so in the future, but we should recognize that Asia also desires to undertake a significant mission in the world, which is peace and cooperation. Our world is already too divided and has too much conflict. May none of us exacerbate this division and conflict further."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 22nd] Dutch Foreign Ministry officials today strongly opposed the American proposal to grant Indonesia complete freedom in 1950. They believe that this American proposal, supported by Cuba, Norway, and China, is completely unacceptable, both in terms of its underlying principles and its specific provisions. Official sources also stated that the establishment of a United Nations Commission for Indonesia is unacceptable.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] Japan's third post-war general election concluded on the night of the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Forty-two million eligible Japanese voters will vote today to elect 466 members of the House of Representatives. The counting of ballots is expected to be completed on the evening of the 24th, at which time the election results will be known. In Japan's third post-war general election, the final total number of candidates for the House of Representatives is 1,365, of whom over 860 are referred to as "new faces." Among the candidates, there are only 44 women, compared to 81 in the 1947 general election. Polling stations in the 117 constituencies across the country opened at 7:00 a.m. and closed at 6:00 p.m. The candidates include 420 from the Democratic Liberal Party, 211 from the Democratic Party, 187 from the Social Democratic Party, 115 from the Communist Party, and the remainder from independent candidates and members of various smaller parties.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 23rd] Although the weather was exceptionally clear today, the Japanese people showed little interest in the election. Three hours before the close of voting, less than 40% of the people in Tokyo and other major cities had voted. Generally speaking, the Japanese people expressed complete indifference to this election. Every Japanese believes that the right-wing group led by Yoshida will surely continue to hold power and will be able to occupy a majority of seats in parliament, so as not to be obstructed by other opposition parties.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Atomic Clock Keeps Time Accurately, Only Losing or Gaining One Second Per Year; Publicly Displayed for the First Time in Washington <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The world's first "atomic clock" was publicly displayed today at the National Bureau of Standards. The time indicated by the clock is extremely accurate. The inventor said that at present, it only loses or gains one second per year, which is close to the accuracy of the Earth's daily rotation, which is currently the standard for world time. The atomic clock is constantly being improved, and in the future, it will be several times more accurate than the Earth's rotation standard, losing or gaining only one second every three hundred years. The atomic clock is a huge device, not one that can be accommodated in an ordinary household. The clock part is only slightly larger than an ordinary office clock, but the attached machinery is the size of a small room. The atomic clock is not powered by atomic energy, but only uses the principle of atomic vibration. The clock disruptor is a small quartz crystal, which vibrates to produce electricity, causing the clock to run. At the same time, the atomic vibration of ammonia gas is used to adjust the vibration of the quartz crystal, ensuring that the clock always runs correctly. The atomic clock not only indicates time but can also be used as a reference for radio frequencies, which is of great use for broadcasting, television, astronomical observation, long-distance navigation and transportation, accurate measurement, and the production of military maps.</p>

<p>The Songhu Garrison Command, in view of the recent influx of troops passing through the city, which often leads to trouble, in order to maintain social order and thoroughly rectify military discipline, had previously ordered the relevant military police and gendarme agencies in the city to crack down on loitering soldiers at any time. However, as the reception centers were not yet formally open, this work could not be continued. The Garrison Command recently established a temporary reception center inside Municipal No. 5 Middle School on Diswei Road and officially began work. Yesterday, it ordered the Ninth Gendarme Regiment, the Joint Military Police Patrol Team of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, the Garrison Brigade, the Garrison Patrol Team, and the police stations to mobilize a total of over 1,500 people to disperse into various districts and crack down on loitering soldiers and rectify military discipline. In one day, over 500 loitering soldiers were rounded up and sent to the reception center. It is reported that the soldiers sent to the reception center will be incorporated into new units or the Garrison Brigade of the Garrison Command according to their original rank, and will be paid their original salaries. Those who are wounded soldiers retreating from the front will be sent directly to designated hospitals for treatment. As for those unlawful officers and soldiers who disrupt social order and cause trouble, they will still be arrested and punished by military law.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] French-owned trams and buses, due to employees requesting a half-month's salary in advance, as per past practice, to cope with the Lunar New Year, were not granted permission by the management due to the difficulty in raising funds. This once caused a slowdown and strike. After persuasion by the Social Bureau and the Lujiawan Police Station, work resumed. The Lujiawan Police Station Chief Song convened labor and management for mediation. Because the company officials were past office hours, they did not send representatives to attend. The labor side believed that the management was not sincere in accepting mediation, so they temporarily decided to implement "treating passengers" as a protest. Vehicles on all lines still operated as usual throughout the day, and ticket sellers went to work in order, but did not sell military tickets. They treated passengers with courtesy and were more polite than usual, and explained to the passengers the reasons for "treating passengers" and the difficulties of maintaining public transport, in order to win the sympathy of most passengers. The order throughout the day was very good, with no disturbances. It is reported that the Municipal Social Bureau and security agencies will invite labor and management to mediate again today.</p>

<p>After the General Labor Union decided not to insist on the original price of rationed rice a few days ago, the person in charge of the union hoped that workers throughout the city would purchase it promptly and not wait and see any longer.

(3) Students and apprentices will be extrapolated based on percentages (985 yuan for 70%, 700 yuan for 50%, 420 yuan for 30%, 280 yuan for 20%, and no other miscellaneous shoe and sock expenses will be paid). (4) The date for the year-end bonus payment is limited to being paid out completely before the 24th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Hotel and Inn Guild Requests Permission to Negotiate Prices Based on Costs <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Hotel and Inn Guild of this city, because the price of rooms in the industry is constrained by the pricing presided over by the Social Bureau, which is greatly out of sync with other prices, causing all members to suffer losses, yesterday afternoon specially invited the press to issue an appeal. It is claimed that the current price of hotel and inn rooms is still stuck at 36 times the price in August 1949, while the calculation results of other prices related to costs have increased by an average of more than 94 times. The reason why hotel room prices cannot be adjusted flexibly is because they are constrained by the strict controlled pricing system. Since the pricing committee passed a 36-fold adjustment for the hotel industry and a 38-fold adjustment for the inn industry on January 4, the municipal meeting was submitted for review and did not approve implementation until the 16th. In the past half month, prices have risen sharply, and almost everything has reached between 100 times. Therefore, they are losing money to the point where they cannot maintain operations. Most members have had to temporarily stop paying water and electricity fees, business tax, and collection of inn taxes in order to make up for it. Currently, there is no pricing by the authorities for any industry. The hotel industry does not fall within the scope of daily necessities and is uniquely subject to this control. Therefore, the industry requires that it be allowed to negotiate prices based on costs by the guild itself, following the precedent of the film and theater industries, and will send representatives to the Social Bureau this morning to petition.</p>

<p>The municipal authorities are considering canceling the tea waiter salary system, as requested by the hotel industry owners, and restoring the original method of collecting tips. Their reason is that tea waiter salaries account for 40% of all expenses in various hotels, which is really unbearable. After learning of this, the Hotel Industry Labor Union, because it concerns the livelihoods of thousands of workers, specially submitted a report to the municipal government, requesting that the salary system be maintained, and listed the expenses and salary portion of various large and small hotels for comparison, as proof. The percentage of monthly salaries for workers in various stores as a percentage of expenses is as follows: Dahut Hotel 25%, Dalu Hotel 23.8%, Central Hostel 24%, Huizhong Inn 29.7%, Dachina Hotel 24%, Jinshan Hotel 26%, Oriental Hotel 28%, Shenzhou Hotel 27%, Yangtze Hotel 24%, Dafang Hotel 32%, Yunsheng 14%, New Life Hotel 10%, Dahua Inn 8.7%, Nanjing Hotel 13%, Nenomiya Hostel 19.7%, Sanpeng Hotel 19%, Chunjiang Hostel 18%, Xinxin Hostel 20%.</p>

<p>Over a hundred people from all walks of life in this city telegraphed President Li yesterday, urging him to start peace talks as soon as possible and remove obstacles first. The original text is as follows: Mr. Delin, I respectfully salute you. Since General Chiang resolutely resigned, you have taken on a difficult task and issued a statement, which is earnest and thought-provoking. The civil war has lasted for three years, and the people have been devastated. Everyone longs for peace, and everyone seeks peace. Not only does the government have this awareness, but the Communists have also expressed their support. After eight years of resistance against Japan and three years of civil war, the people of Shanghai are exhausted and industries have gone bankrupt. Our desire for peace and democracy is no less than that of others. However, the peace that we, the citizens of Shanghai, hope for is true, democratic, and lasting peace. In order to promote the arrival of true, democratic peace, we hereby submit the following proposals and respectfully request their adoption: (1) In order to promote the realization of peace negotiations, the government's five peace talk representatives should immediately contact the Communists to conduct peace negotiations. (2) In order to show the sincerity of striving for peace, the government should immediately abolish the Suppression of Rebellion Order and related regulations and measures. (3) In order to remove obstacles to peace, the government should immediately and unconditionally open up freedom of speech, release political prisoners, and abolish the Special Criminal Court. In short, the success of true peace depends on the people striving for true popular will. As your statement shows, "I hope to cultivate a peaceful atmosphere in the country so that peace talks can proceed smoothly." Therefore, it needs to be based on the facts of democracy in order to achieve true democratic peace. These are humble opinions, and we hope that you will consider them carefully. We are very fortunate.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to postal bureau sources, since the Xujiapeng Airport in Hankou was damaged and civil aviation flights were suspended, airmail from this city to Hankou was once transferred via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. However, due to traffic disruptions on that line, it was difficult to divert mail. This line was abandoned and another route was sought. Currently, airmail sent to Hankou and handed over for review on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays is transported to Guangzhou daily by China Central Airlines flights, and then taken to Hankou by the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Airmail sent on Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays is transported to Hengyang by the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hengyang-Guilin-Liuzhou-Guangzhou flights of the Civil Aviation Brigade on Tuesday mornings, and then transported by land from Hengyang to Hankou. In addition to these two lines, if there are convenient planes that can land at the Hankou military airport, attempts will also be made to have them carried. The postal bureau is making every effort to divert airmail between Shanghai and Hankou and will definitely not interrupt it.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The dispute over the splitting of accounts and year-end bonuses for hairdressing workers has not yet been resolved, and various barbershops are still closed. At this time of year, the industry should be thriving and profits should be doubling. Because of the labor unrest, customers are being turned away. The Social Bureau will convene labor and management again today for mediation in order to seek a resolution.</p>
<p>According to the labor union, the crux of the current dispute is the year-end bonus issue. The workers initially demanded that the year-end bonus for each person be based on the income of twelve "heads" within the year. They have now conceded to five "heads," while the management only agrees to one and a half "heads." The Social Bureau proposed a compromise of three "heads," to which the management has not yet responded.</p>

<p>[Our Own Correspondent] After Wang, wife of Jiang Jingqi, manager of the Wuxi Farmers Bank, was shot dead in her room at approximately 8:30 p.m. on the 20th, the news spread like wildfire throughout the city because the location was in the city, close to the Guangfu Gate Police Station, and not far from the evening curfew. This attracted the attention of the security authorities. In addition to the Investigation Team detaining two suspects, County Magistrate Li issued a handwritten order, instructing the Criminal Investigation Team of the Police Bureau to solve the case within a time limit. After receiving the order, the county police instructed members of the Criminal Investigation Team to investigate in all directions. It was later discovered that the suspect Yu Zhongyi had fled to Shanghai. Therefore, the group leader of the Criminal Investigation Team, Lin Ziwen, led several police officers, equipped with official documents, and arrived in Shanghai at approximately 7:15 p.m. the day before yesterday. They contacted the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau for assistance. Bureau Chief Zhao and Section Chief Hao immediately ordered staff member Weng Yongquan to lead police to surround and arrest the suspect at No. 9, Lane 90, North Chengdu Road. Unexpectedly, the suspect had already fled to Ningbo the day before. Only his brother Yu Penghai was arrested, and a Browning pistol and four bullets were found in his residence. He was immediately taken back to the sub-bureau. According to his confession, his brother Zhongyi did arrive home on the afternoon of the 21st and told him that he had committed a serious crime in Wuxi. However, he refused to reveal the details of the case. He asked to borrow travel expenses to escape to other places. Since he had no cash on hand, he only borrowed more than ten silver dollars. He stayed for one night and then set off at dawn the next morning, presumably fleeing to Ningbo. After the sub-bureau conducted an initial interrogation, the person and the gun were handed over to the officers who came from Wuxi. They took the overnight express train to Wuxi that evening. It is rumored that the cause of the case was a vendetta.</p>

<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Yu Yiming (also known as Yu Junping), director of the Nantong Radio Station of the National Defense Ministry's Confidential Bureau, had a close relationship with his classmate Wang Guozhen. Qiu Disheng, a communications officer at the Air Force Radio Station in the Shanghai area, had some free time and often assisted in the work at the 13th Branch of the Telecommunications Headquarters of the First Police Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation. With the consent of the head of the station, Shen Delin, and through Wang's introduction, Qiu and Yu agreed to send and receive commercial telegrams between Nantong and Shanghai in order to obtain illegal profits. Yu and Qiu were both found guilty and sentenced to death by the National Defense Ministry's Confidential Bureau. Wang, because he was not a member of the military, was transferred to the local court of this city for sentencing. Wang then applied for a retrial, which was sent back for retrial. Wu Ronglin, judge of the local court, announced the verdict at 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday: Wang Guozhen is sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for assisting others in directly seeking illegal profits from the affairs under his management.</p>

<p>[Our Own Correspondent] As the Lunar New Year approaches, citizens are busy preparing for the New Year's Eve dinner, leading to a sharp increase in the prices of all kinds of vegetables in the markets. Fish and meat prices have increased even more dramatically. The price of lean pork legs reached 120 yuan per catty yesterday, and ribs also cost 100 yuan, which is prohibitive for ordinary citizens. Although yesterday was a regular weekly holiday, near noon, the meat shops and stalls were still full of pork, but there were few buyers. The butchers wore bitter smiles, saying: "Pork is expensive, and fewer people are eating meat. Originally, one rack of pork was not enough for a day's sales, but now one rack cannot be sold in a few days." Their disappointment was evident. Fortunately, beef is still cheap, at 70 yuan per catty. However, the prices of chicken and duck are on par with pork, also requiring 110 to 120 yuan per catty. Green fish is a top-quality product for thanking the gods at the end of the year, and its price is also extraordinarily high, at 90 yuan per catty. A green fish weighing ten catties or more costs more than 1,000 yuan. Other types of fish, such as bighead carp, small yellow croaker, and ribbonfish, are priced at 2.5 to 3 yuan per tael. Large yellow croakers cost 70 yuan per catty. Despite such high prices, the fishmongers argue that there is a major trend in the fish market, and they are not making excessive profits. Fresh shrimp prices lead the pack, at 200 yuan per catty. Small shrimp also cost 140 yuan per catty. Eggs cost 6 to 10 yuan each.</p>
<p>Among vegetables, those related to foreign vegetables are particularly expensive. Large cabbages cost 120 yuan each, onions cost 45 yuan per pound, and tomatoes cost 30 yuan per pound. Yellow soybean sprouts and germinated beans cost 8 to 10 yuan per catty. Tofu costs 10 yuan per piece, spinach costs 7 yuan per catty, and Chinese cabbage and glue cabbage cost 16 to 18 yuan per catty. Winter bamboo shoots cost 30 yuan per catty. Potatoes cost 9 yuan per catty. Other vegetables, such as pagoda vegetables, greens, and cabbage, mostly cost 4 yuan per catty. Ordinary housewives, seeing these high prices, return home disappointed, exclaiming: "How can we survive this New Year!"</p>
<h3 id="e69">Disrupted Traffic on Both Railways, Passenger Train Delays Set New Record, Carriages Packed, Thousands Waiting at Stations <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Since the war approached the capital, the Jinghu and Huhang Railways have increased the number of extra trains to supply military transport and evacuation, making it impossible to maintain the normal traffic order of passenger trains. Train delays have become commonplace, and the degree of delays is increasing daily. Yesterday, all trains on both lines were delayed by more than seven hours, setting a new record for delays. The "West Lake" express train from Hangzhou to Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 4:05 p.m. (which was scheduled to arrive at the North Shanghai Station at 8:05 p.m. that afternoon) stopped and waited at each station along the way due to extra trains. It stopped at Xin Zhuang and New Longhua for more than an hour each, and at the West Station for another half hour. Stopping and starting like this, it did not arrive at the North Station in this city until about 3:00 a.m. yesterday. Because the frost was heavy outside the station, the dew was thick, and the cold was piercing, and because it was during curfew hours, passengers refused to get off the train. The train attendants tried to persuade them to no avail. Because the platform needed to be cleared for the next train to stop, the entire train of passengers was forced out of the station. At 6:00 a.m. yesterday, when the train re-entered the station to prepare to depart for Hangzhou, the passengers disembarked. The 11th overnight express train on the Jinghu Line the night before last was also unable to depart for a while due to crowded trains on the main line. It did not receive its route permit until 10:00 a.m. yesterday, so it did not arrive in Shanghai until 3:05 p.m., more than eight hours late. The delays of other passenger trains can be imagined.</p>
<p>[Additional News] The chaotic train situation yesterday caused widespread delays of two to eight hours for trains on both lines. Thousands of passengers were waiting at the stations, and the disorder at the stations was unprecedented. The trains on both lines were not only packed inside the carriages, but also the locomotives, guard cars, baggage cars, postal cars, and rooftops were crowded with passengers, making it impossible to load luggage and mail. According to the Railway Bureau, the traffic chaos yesterday was unprecedented, and the reason was that soldiers were forcibly occupying carriages and military transport was busy. The overnight express sleeper car from Beijing to Shanghai was delayed for nearly eight hours. The Railway Bureau is currently trying to find ways to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Tang Enbo Issues Handwritten Order Stipulating Regulations for Military Personnel and Troops Traveling by Train</p>

<p>Time flies so fast, and the Lunar New Year is approaching in the blink of an eye. Although we have already celebrated the Gregorian New Year on January 1st, "old habits die hard," and everyone will greet this ancient festival with a special kind of excitement. In today's difficult times, we hope that every reader, in addition to celebrating the festival, can save a little money and do something beneficial to humanity. Wealthy families are preparing to eat New Year's Eve dinner and celebrate the New Year. Children are wearing new clothes and eating candy. But a group of struggling, impoverished young people are worrying about their tuition fees for the next semester! This newspaper is sponsoring the historically significant "Reader Scholarship Fund." We hope to raise more donations before and after the Lunar New Year so that in the near future, we can help those young people who are unable to continue their studies to solve the difficulties of pursuing their education. This extremely meaningful good deed, we believe, will surely be greatly supported by all readers.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Basketball League Second Act, McLeans Marines Lose First Battle to Renyu, Kang Team Thrashes "Movie Stars" <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Last night was the second act of the basketball league, with three games. In the main battle, McLeans lost to Renyu, 57 to 38, with a halftime score of 32 to 19. This was the 9th Regiment of the US Marine Corps. In the second game, Group A of Division II, Youyi lost to the Kang team. Youyi is composed entirely of famous people in the film industry, including Han Fei, Shi Hui, Jin Yan, Zhang Fa, Wei Yuping, Ling Zhihao, and other movie stars, who were very popular with the audience. As a result, the movie stars lost 55 to 38, with a halftime score of 34 to 17. In the women's group, the Green team defeated the Li team 62 to 11, with a halftime score of 36 to 6. Last night's audience was estimated at a thousand people, making it quite lively.</p>
<p>The Li team in the women's group was inexperienced, and the outcome was predetermined. Throughout the 32 minutes, they lived under the enemy's invasion. The Green team had many veterans retire this year and spared no effort in recruiting new talents, still possessing the ambition of a hegemon. Youyi is made up of people in the film industry, and the audience looked at "Shi Hui" and "Shui Ni" in a different light, shouting their support. However, a thousand electric light bulbs cannot compare to life under the mercury lights. The heroes had no place to use their talents. Renyu was originally strong, and with Cai Jindian participating, its strength became even more abundant. McLeans, although defeated, remained unconvinced and fought to the end.</p>
<p>Green Team Wins Against Li (Women's Group)</p>
<p>The Green team had a well-organized lineup, all of whom were "veterans" in this field, scoring seven points in an instant. The Li team, led by Weng Xiayun and Wang Jiahua, scored four consecutive points, with the first quarter ending 13 to 4. The momentum remained the same in the second quarter. When the Green team reached 23 points, the Li team only added one point. The Green team had a big victory in the first half, with a score of 30 to 6. In the third quarter, Lu Huijun replaced Cao Meili for the Green team, and Zhu Jinyun was reassigned to forward. It was quite difficult for the Li team to score, making the fans anxious. The score for this quarter was 49 to 11. In the final quarter, the Li team tried to fight back, but the enemy's momentum was difficult to stop. As a result, the Green team won 62 to 11.</p>

<p>[Our Own Correspondent] At approximately 11:50 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out at the home of Xu Wangcai, a peddler from Siyang who lived in a shantytown at No. 3 Taiping Lane, the intersection of Linping Road and Tianbao Road in Pudong. Careless cooking caused the fire to spread outside the stove, and the flames quickly spread, soaring into the sky. The adjacent shantytowns were all engulfed in flames, and the fire also spread to the shops along Linping Road, including Xue Tongji's carpentry shop at No. 234, Tianbao Xiang Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 236 to 238, Huachangxing Hotel at No. 240, Xie Yuji Cotton Shop at No. 242, and Yongfa North Goods and Sugar Shop at No. 244.

<p>In addition, the company has sugar in Shanghai, currently more than 20,000 tons, enough to maintain the city's needs for two months. New sugar from Taiwan has already been put on the market and can be shipped to Shanghai one after another. However, due to the congestion of ships at ports such as Keelung, loading and unloading goods is difficult. The company authorities are currently working hard to allocate resources, and it is expected that new sugar will be shipped to Shanghai in the near future to replenish supplies.</p>

<p>Kang Team Wins Against Youyi (Division II A)</p>
<p>The second game was Division II A, Youyi versus Kang. The Youyi team is all made up of film industry workers. Apart from making a stunning appearance at the beginning, their subsequent performance was unfavorable. However, the audience encouraged and sympathized with their spirit of loving sports. At 24 to 0, they made a review and adjustment. At the fifteen-minute mark, they scored several consecutive goals, causing much excitement. The first half ended 34 to 17, with the Kang team in the lead. In the second half, Youyi's Hao Zhangfa and Xue Wu and others made smooth layups, and the opponent dared not underestimate them.

<h3 id="e83">The Mystery of Nantong's Grain Supply <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent, Cong Yongshu</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nantong, 18th] The rice of Northern Jiangsu mostly comes from the Lixiahe region, but Nantong is a county that cannot produce enough grain for its own needs. Nantong is located along the river and the sea, and is a cotton-producing area, so it needs to rely on other places for its rice.</p>
<p>Before the war, Nantong could still be considered a transfer point for grain in Northern Jiangsu. Every year around the Mid-Autumn Festival, when new grains from Taixian, Dongtai, Jiangyan, Qutang, and Haian were harvested, teams of sailboats carrying rice southward would continuously sail along the Yunyan River from Rugao to Nantong. Nantong never experienced grain shortages. The rice for Qidong, Hai, and the Jiangnan region was also transferred from here. Tangzha Town, located fifteen li northwest of the county seat, is an industrial center and also a grain center. The wide river was often filled with grain boats, a very lively scene. However, since the post-war recovery, such a scene has never been seen again. In the rice-producing areas of Northern Jiangsu, most places are unstable and transportation is inconvenient. Although rice is still produced there every year, not as much white rice is being shipped here anymore.</p>
<p>After the victory, Nantong's food supply has largely relied on Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Even if the local farmers grow some, they mostly keep it for themselves and rarely sell it. Rugao, north of Nantong, produces more rice, but the area that can be controlled this year is very limited, so the amount of rice supplied to other counties is also very small. Rice from Taixian, Jiangyan, and Qutang is difficult to transport directly to Nantong. Most of it is first transported to Wuxi in Jiangnan, sold off, and then purchased and transported from Wuxi to Nantong by Nantong grain merchants.</p>
<p>Therefore, a county located on the edge of the grain-producing area has a higher grain price than a transfer city (such as Wuxi). However, Nantong's grain price is not only high, but also abnormally high. When it was 700 yuan per shi in Wuxi and 800 yuan per shi in Shanghai, it was 1,400 yuan per shi in Nantong. When it was 800 yuan per shi in Wuxi and 1,000 yuan per shi in Shanghai, it was 2,000 yuan per shi in Nantong. At its peak, it was 1,200 yuan in Wuxi, 1,480 yuan in Shanghai, and 2,800 yuan in Nantong. Generally speaking, it is about one-half higher than in Shanghai. The main reason for such an abnormally high price is the difficulty in transportation. In addition, there are also unscrupulous merchants who intentionally raise the market price.</p>
<p>As early as the beginning of December, grain merchants were collectively purchasing rice in Wuxi, but because the ports in Jiangnan were closed, especially after the Huangdian Port was closed, the rice boats were blocked in Jiangyin and could not pass, which further promoted the rise in grain prices. As a result, there were especially many small-scale rice traders on the steamers between Nantong and Shanghai. A person could use four flour sacks to carry one shi of rice from Shanghai across the river to Nantong and immediately earn 1,000 yuan, equivalent to a small package of foreign yarn. It was a very convenient thing to do, so the passengers on the steamers have been particularly crowded these days.</p>
<p>The nearly 10,000 dan of rice stranded in Jiangyin, after more than a month of delay and many procedures and negotiations, was finally transported back. In theory, the rice price could be determined according to the previous method devised by the Economic Office of the Command Post: the Wuxi rice price, plus the due transportation costs and profits, should be 1.2 times the Wuxi rice price per shi. However, it is said that the cost of transporting this batch of rice was quite staggering. With the arrival of 8,000 shi of rice, the grain price appeared to be weakening, but Wuxi and Shanghai reported weakening before Nantong. This shows that the weakening of Nantong's rice market is not necessarily due to the arrival of this batch of rice. Sure enough, in less than two days, the rice price rose again.</p>
<p>The newly appointed County Magistrate Huang also felt very strange about the grain price in Nantong. Across the river, the grain price was raised by more than double. At a press conference, County Magistrate Huang talked about this issue. He said: Seeing the daily rise in grain prices, although the amount of tax revenue collected is not much, many people are suffering invisibly. Therefore, he planned to purchase grain in Jiangnan. Just as the Command Post ordered the purchase of grain for storage, he allocated 1.9 million yuan from the central and provincial funds, and borrowed 500,000 yuan from the county treasury, making a total of 2.4 million yuan to purchase in Jiangnan. Some people said: The government is purchasing grain to distribute to public servants and teachers. County Magistrate Huang said: "You can't say that. Because there are so many public servants and teachers, but the amount of grain purchased is limited, who should be given and who should not?"</p>
<p>According to County Magistrate Huang, the purpose of purchasing grain is to try out the transportation situation along the way and see how much it costs. Because now the government is like a blind man, and can only listen to the merchants' asking prices. If the price is suppressed, they say they will lose money. If you insist on suppressing the price, they will not sell, which will cause a grain shortage. However, if the government's purchase of grain and transportation causes the merchants to play a joke on the government and the rice price in Nantong falls, then not only will public servants and teachers benefit, but also ordinary people can eat cheaper rice. County Magistrate Huang said with emotion: "In fact, even if ordinary people eat cheap rice, who will understand the government's intention? Some people may laugh at the government for losing money!" County Magistrate Huang also said: "If not, at least we can know the difficulty and cost of transportation, and we will no longer be blind to what the grain merchants say. As for this fund, it will not be affected by the depreciation of the currency." This is a good plan and it is hoped that it can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>The rice-hoarding craze that occurred continuously in Guangzha on the 9th and 10th (see page 7 of the Taibao on the 14th) was also caused by the high price of rice. The usual practice is that when the Dasheng Yarn Factory pays wages, the workers buy rice and yarn with the money, and the rice and yarn become particularly popular due to the temporary strong sales, and the prices rise quietly. The wages in Nantong are generally calculated according to the cost of living index in Shanghai. There are no rations here, and the prices are higher than in Shanghai, so the purchasing power of the same wage is much weaker. After the rice-hoarding case occurred, the Nantong Command Post and the county government paid close attention to it and consulted on handling the aftermath: on the one hand, the Chamber of Commerce tried to suppress the grain price as much as possible, and on the other hand, the factory was unable to improve the workers' treatment and make up for the difference in the cost of living index. The perpetrators will be investigated and severely punished, and the damaged businesses will be given loans to enable them to continue operating. The incident was handled properly and stopped, without expanding.</p>
<p>What Nantong is now expecting is smooth flow of grain sources. As long as the sources are open and convenient for purchase and transportation, both large and small merchants can purchase in Jiangnan, and with abundant rice sources, the grain price will naturally not develop abnormally.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Changshu Councilor Zou Zijian and Others Tragically Killed by Township Head; Murderer Zhu Jingliang Flees <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Changshu, 22nd] County Councilor Zou Zijian and clerk Teng Qiming were collecting land rent in their hometown of Zhangjiaqiao when they were suddenly ambushed and killed. After an examination by the District Procuratorate, their bodies have been collected by their families for burial. Zou Zihe, Zou Zinan, and Sun Kang, who were injured, have seen their injuries improve and are out of danger. The criminal investigation team of the police bureau, led by its captain, was ordered to go to arrest the murderer along with the deputy commander of the security regiment, Zhang, to bring them to justice. However, it was found that the murderer was the current township head of Zhaojun Township, Zhu Jingliang, who had fled after the incident. His reply stated: (1) Zhu Jingliang stayed overnight at the township office around 2:00 AM on the 17th, and on the morning of the 18th, he led four members of the self-defense standby team, Xi Quanfa, Zou Genbao, Xu Shangen, and Wang Xiaohu from Zhangjiaqiao, disguised as peasants, and disappeared. (2) Zhu Jingliang's family, including his mother and wife, were also taken away, and the Xietai Shun grocery store he set up in Zhangjiaqiao Town was closed down. When leaving, they took away one rapid-firing rifle, two revolvers, and one Mauser pistol (number unknown). (3) The families of Xi Quanfa and others are still in the township, and the township office has sent personnel to temporarily monitor them. A detachment of the security regiment is stationed at the township office, and the 12 rifles of the township office have been temporarily confiscated.</p>

<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] He Ruxi, the director of the tax bureau of this county, was suddenly accused of being a traitor to the enemy by a person named Ding Yingtian on the 18th, who reported to the High Court that He had led the puppet army to arrest him during the enemy occupation and extorted tens of millions of puppet currency. After the victory, He's whereabouts were unknown. Now that he saw He serving as the director of the tax bureau of this county, he specially reported him. However, the High Procuratorate approved on the 19th that the Central Government's order to report traitors had ended on December 31, 1946, and overdue reports would not be considered.</p>
<p>Yixing</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The County's Grain and Food Office stipulated that the grain processing yield for 1948 should be 5.25 dou of brown rice per shi (108 catties), but this is absolutely impossible, and all processors have refused to accept the processing. It is reported that this is an increase of 1.5 sheng compared to last year, which will inevitably lead to losses, resulting in a stalemate. The collection of grain and the warehouse capacity are insufficient. The commissioner specially sent a report to Chairman Ding and Director He, requesting a reduction in the yield rate.</p>
<p>Wuxing</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The bandit Feng Shuiqing has repeatedly colluded to rob along the waterways in the Hu-Hang area, committing numerous crimes. The bandit has been ordered by the First District Commissioner's Office to be arrested and brought to justice.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The construction of the Jin-Wu branch line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is being actively carried out by the Zhejiang provincial authorities in conjunction with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, and some progress has been made. It is reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has sent Chief Secretary Zeng Ziwei and Luo Jigang, director of the Light Railway Preparatory Office, to Jin, and will convene representatives from Jin, Lan, Wu, Tang, Qu, Long, Sui, and other counties in Jin on the 23rd to discuss the issue of raising 30,000 sleepers.</p>
<p>Lanxi</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the Lanxi County Grain and Food Office has been collecting funds for the county's pacification, it has collected 212,638 shi of grain by the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Luhe</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Cao Shengxu, the deputy director of the County Grain and Food Office, was jointly accused of corruption and dereliction of duty by Qian Zhiyao, Zhu Shihou, and others from the county. Prosecutor Xu of the District Procuratorate personally opened a court hearing at 10:00 AM on the 17th. The plaintiffs and defendants were all present to confront each other, but no results were obtained. It is reported that the case still needs to be continued.</p>
