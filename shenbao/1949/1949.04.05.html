<h3 id="c1">和談今日正式開始　商討八項條件原則　中共同意頒發停戰命令 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕確息：政府與中共雙方和平代表團之正式談判，決定自五日起在平開始。中共且已同意在和談期中停止軍事進攻，此項命令卽可由中共軍事當局頒發，通知前線部隊，以上兩點為李代總統私人啓漢三日乘中杭專機自平返京攜來之消息。據悉：政府和平代表團抵平後，卽與中共代表作非正式之接觸，研商有關和談程序之技術問題，現此項工作業已完成，故決定於五日開始正式會談，就毛澤東所提之八項條件進行討論。中共對八項條件之態度，仍堅持原則不變，但對尺度已考慮放寬，至放寬之程度，則將於正式會議中討論決定，此點實為此次和談開始前最重要之發展，亦可視為未來商談成敗之關鍵。關於中共同意停止軍事進攻一點，乃以全面停戰問題在技術上及若干細節上待研究者甚多，非短期內可決定，故必須留俟正式會議中討論，惟在和談進行期中，軍事進攻顯將有所影響，故政府特就此向中共提出要求，俾和談能於祥和之空氣中進行，故政府代表與中共方面經三日之接觸及非正式會議，已獲得中共之同意，此種停止軍事進攻之行動，亦卽就地停戰之開始，全面和平之期望，似又邁進一步。就上述消息視之，政府和談代表團業已獲得顯著之成就，在此期中，彼等除與中共和談各代表密切接觸外，並曾與毛澤東等中共領袖晤談，經過情形良好。黃啓漢三日返抵南京後，當晚卽赴傳厚崗官邸晉謁李代總統報告，黃氏並攜來信件甚多，政府各代表顧問等均有書信分致其有關人士。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕和談進行之程序，大致分為：（一）初步交換意見，（二）正式會談，（三）政協會議三個階段，現初步交換意見階段業先告結束，正式會談自五日開始，此一階段將商討關於八項條件之原則問題，如進行順利，獲得結論後，則第二階段可以宣告結束，而改組聯合政府等，亦可能卽時展開，新的政協亦可望審備召開，解決八項條件上各項有關廢止憲法，改編軍隊等之技術問題。觀察家認為：第一階段所可獲得的成就，將見諸中共之停止進攻，就地停戰似為一順利之開始，但第二階段可能立卽遭遇難題，故新政協之召開，為期當甚遙遠。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕政府和談代表抵平已四日，在過去三日內所有之接觸，均為一般性之拜訪與非正式交換意見，惟中共當局對代表團極為重視，代表團所接觸之中共人士，除和談代表周恩來等五氏及其他民主人士外，毛澤東亦已會晤，聞政府代表團以連日聽取中共廣播，其中批評政府之詞句仍極尖刻侮謾，曾以之詢問中共，其答覆則謂，此係政工人員所為，非當局之指示，表示中共當局係誠意談和，與此無涉。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕和談正式開始前夕，李代總統於聽取黃啓漢對北平之報告後，四日特在官邸邀約在京要員集會，商討有關對策，並兩度與北平通長途電話，與張治中交換意見，並指示處理之態度，與會者有何應欽，吳忠信，翁文灝，黃啓漢，邱昌渭等。</p>
<h3 id="c2">雷震發表對和談感想　促全民提高警覺　對所謂聯合政府問題不可忽視 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社臺北四日電〕前政治協商會議秘書長雷震，曾於三日離臺前發表談話稱：「和平正為全國人民所企求，我們自然希望有一合情合理的真實和平實現，惟對所謂聯合政府一問題，吾人不可忽視，而應特別提高警覺，蓋和談結果如實現了中共所操縱的所謂聯合政府，則中國前途將不堪設想，這可從兩方面來說：第一，內政方面，必然是走向反自由，反民主及反人性的前途，達成共黨暴力專政之局。第二，外交方面，照中蘇條約的規定，蘇聯政府在道義上須予國民政府以援助，今後如有一聯合政府產生繼承國民政府的法統，而所謂聯合政府，實質上又是受中共所操縱，則蘇聯政府卽可名正言順的假援助之名，把中國拉入共產國際鐵幕之內，捷克先例可為殷鑒，這是我們對於和談前途應予特別注意的。如果結果如此，我們必須堅決反對」。雷氏繼對此次和談發表感想稱：「此次和談準備過程中，中共所表現的作風與卅五年政協時期政府的民主風度大相逕庭，第一，當時政府方面對於中共的代表，不僅在接待和洽談方面都很禮貌，卽在會議塲上儘管中共代表肆力謾罵，甚或侮辱，而政府代表則始終保持容忍的態度，而且當時政府區域的報紙亦接受政府的指導，避免登載刺激性的文字，但這次中共的廣播，儼然以受降者的口吻，指政府代表為反動的政府代表。第二，當時政協開幕前，中共代表周恩來堅持非停戰不參加會議，政府卒於會議開幕之日（卽一月十日）上午八時下令停戰，十時會議開始。現在中共的軍隊仍積極在長江北岸進行攻擊安慶外團，襄樊一帶及徵儀等處的態勢，尤為顯例。第三，當時政協開會時，並不封鎖新聞，記者可以參加旁聽，自由報道，現在北平的和談，竟不許記者旁聽，中共近幾年來所宣傳的「民主」，其骨子裏究竟是什麼，我們於此也可約略的得到一個有力的反證。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕關於中外新聞記者要求準許赴平採訪和談新聞事，頃政府和談代表團首席代表張治中氏對此有所答覆，渠自平致電首都記者公會，略稱：代表團抵平以後，經與共方代表毅然交換意見，僉以和平商談方始，中外記者自以暫緩來平為宜，並請轉知各報社諒察，為荷。</p>

<p>〔本報南京四日電〕李代總統四日在招待留京國代之宴會上，說明渠謀和之苦心及謀和必成之因素。渠強調以人民意志為意志之重要及今日人民需要和平之迫切，故在渠謀和之基礎上，實有人民支持之後盾，是以謀和必可有所成就。代總統並說明當前內部團結之重要，而徒恃武力者，終必失敗。代總統之宴會，係於四日上午十二時在總統府招待留京國代者，出席一百八十餘人，代總統致詞後，有數代表起立致詞，除對代總統之領導表示擁護外，並強調全面和平，平等和平之需要，至下午二時始散。</p>

<p>〔本報南京四日電〕閻錫山因李代總統挽留，將在京再住三數日後返并。閻氏四日語記者，如和談成功，渠自將遵守政府命令，如和談不成功，渠決誓死抵抗保衛太原。關於傳作義發表聲明事，閻氏根據對傳氏性格之認識，判斷此舉或係中共對傳作有計劃之說服而造成之結果，渠雖無任何事實為證，但渠不信該聲明係中共撰成迫傳簽字者，渠信該聲明可能係出自傳之秘書手筆，閻氏認為中共此種作法，乃為對政府發動之宣傳攻勢，以爭取更多之個別投降。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕美籍記者賴德曼，近游歷重慶，成都，蘭州，西寗等地，並訪問青海主席馬步芳，縱論時事。據謂：當時馬步芳將軍堅決表示，渠不願接受未來國共和平協定之約束，青海現有勁旅十萬，內泰半為回教徒，將與中共週旋到底，決不妥協。馬將軍對過去中央政府未能以充分美援軍火接濟青海，深青不滿，對蔣總統尤多批評。謂青省一共僅收得美援軍火五十噸，內二十噸為武器，三十噸為彈藥，方由陳納德空運大隊運至青省。寗夏馬鴻逵收到之美援軍火，為數亦彷彿，且為此付出空運運費十六萬美金。關於青海軍隊之裝備，馬步芳承認缺乏砲隊，輕兵器種類大雜，故補給困難，而整個西北並無軍火廠存在。</p>
<h3 id="c17">立院財金委會席上　劉攻蕓報告財政　政府握有巨額金銀外匯　一年之內經濟決無崩潰之虞 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕財長劉攻蕓，四日上午列席立院財金委會報告財政時，承認目前財政金融確已面臨困境，經濟之惡化日深，甚為可慮。惟政府現正從（一）開源（增加收入），（二）節流（減少支出），（三）彌補不足（借外債）三方面努力中，如三者中有一項可以解決，卽可考慮根本改革。目前因種種困難，此三者事實上均難獲得根本解決，只有從勉維現況，使經濟不再繼續惡化做起。劉氏報告時，係以政院施政方針中關於財政金融部分為依據，逐項加以解釋，而特別着重於增加收入，減少支出及彌補不足三問題。關於增加收入部分，劉氏指出過去由於商人納稅多延期繳付，影響稅收及支出百分之四，故決定關稅改收關元，並另創稅元，俾稅收可以不受物價波動及幣値貶落影響，現並對稅收力加整頓中。關於減少支出部分，劉氏指出在根本狀況未改變前，一般人所倡導之裁員減政及裁軍等等，均須俟三五月後如能發生作用，在裁員減政之當時，只有增加支出，如裁軍二十萬人，卽須增加支出遣散費約一千億元，至彌補不足，只有舉債，向美借款及白銀事現尚在接洽中，雖有希望，然並無確切把握。舉辦財產稅亦為彌補不足之一途，惟將來成效如何，現時亦無法預定。劉氏繼論及金元券發行情形，謂：裁至三月底止，發行之數字為二千億元，較之二月增加三倍，如四月一再惡化，仍維持三月份增加三倍之狀況，則發行卽須增加三倍之狀況，則發行卽須增加六千億元，而四月份之支出預計將達八千億元，尚須另行設法彌補，希望能以拋售金銀外匯及特效收回四千億元，俾經濟狀況不致再行惡化。孔宋時代拋售採低價政策，欲求穩定整個金融，最後歸於失敗，現在拋售政策之目的，在收回金元，故改採高價政策。至此，劉氏鄭重宣稱，政府所握有金銀外匯總値仍達二億餘美元，如三月份之發行為兩千億元，僅須美金一千萬元卽可將所有之金元券收回，以後如每月拋售一千五百萬美元，以政府握有金銀包匯數量，仍可支持一年，故一年內經濟決無崩潰之虞。至鈔荒問題，若干地區確甚嚴重，惟一週以後相信卽可解除。劉氏報告畢，立委李世軍，王力航等多人卽紛紛提出質詢，綜合意見為：（一）高價拋售政刺激物價，為「做生意」之手段，應予改正；（二）關稅及其他稅收改以關元稅元計算，表示政府自己對金元已不信任；（三）有錢出錢，應動用豪門財產；（四）政府收況人民之金銀外匯為數若干？如何動用？王力航並力言上海之一切投機取巧行為，多為國家行局所領導，應加澈底整頓。迄十二時許，劉氏除作口頭答復外，並表示對立委之詢將以書面詳為答復。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕軍息：安慶外圍戰事，二日因天氣陰沉，較為沉寂，二日晚，共軍乘陰黑之夜，向外圍陣地猛攻，戰鬥異常激烈，國軍陸海協同奮勇還擊，激戰澈夜，斃傷共軍一萬多人，造成安慶保衛戰之空前戰績，三日竟日共軍積極調動部署，並陸續增援，迄晚其在安慶外圍兵力已增至五萬人，再度向國軍陣地展開猛攻，守軍在海軍砲火掩護下，至午夜十二時，又將來犯共軍擊退，四日上午戰事復趨沉寂，國軍刻仍確保安慶外圍獅子山·五里墩·棋盤山·農業學校原陣地。</p>

<h3 id="c21">如何避免和談的暗礁？ <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>政府和談代表於四月一日自京飛平後，據傳還始終沒有觸及具體問題，首三天祗有各代表與中共代表個別洽談，聽說為的是培養感情，以免事情一來就弄僵。大槪從今天起或可漸漸談到題目。又聞雙方代表擬先分為外交，軍事，政治曁經濟四小組，分別進行磋商，等到小組有了商議眉目，再正式開議。至政府代表向中共提出的兩項建議：（一）國共兩軍應即就地停戰，和（二）先行召開新政治協商會議，討論整軍及憲法修改問題，則中共方面，雖其首席代表來表示可以考慮，卻至今沒有答復。據昨晚最後傳來消息，謂雙方代表已定今日正式開始談議，同時中共同意在和談期中，停止軍事進攻，但這猶待停戰令頒發後才能證實。可是同時，中共電臺卻連日廣播，拿了南京學軍衝突事件，大做題外文章，指罵李代總統與何院長所領導的政府為全無和平誠意，且說共軍「已決心解放全中國」。</p>
<p>和平，誰都希望的；惟看近幾天情況，安慶城郊和平漢南段，共軍步步進逼，毫不放鬆，可見和談雖已開始，但確仍缺乏祥和氣象。為使和談的途中不致觸著暗礁，我們站在人民立塲，不得不率直指出幾件要不得的事實，以喚起國共雙方的注意，尤其要喚起全國同胞的警覺。</p>
<p>第一，和談要成功，祗有公開每日和談的進程與內容，繼能做到。蓋和談是有關全國四萬萬人民生死存亡的大事，不是國共雙方的「兒戲」，絕無理由可以秘密不使人知。而況，和談雙方旣各自以為有理，那就不妨各將所提條件辦法和理由，說出來折服對方，並讓人民聽聽。說得粗俗一些，和談應該不是上海人所說的「軋姘頭」，用不著偷偷摸摸的。何以政府代表北上以後，一聽共黨的控制和擺佈，半點消息都不肯透露，更何以不許京滬各地新聞記者採訪消息？難道他們所談的，都不是光天化日之下可見人面的嗎？須知和談如果有暗礁，必起因於「暗」，若變為明礁，就可避開而保證安全了。第一步就走錯了，深為和談前途擔憂。</p>
<p>第二，和談要成功，必須於國共雙方代表之外，容許有善意的人民代表參加其間，然後調停斡旋，可收相當的效果。乃今政府代表不此之圖，一切祗知造就共黨，對各地人民團體之意見，毫不重視，更談不到邀請人民代表參與討論。設果有所爭執，必致公說公有理，婆說婆有理，而毫無轉圜之餘地。</p>
<p>第三，和談要成功，天經地義應該首先立即停止一切軍事行動，不但前線不能再有戰事，就是雙方的一切軍隊都應各駐原防，聽候整編。從前政協會議進行時，國民政府在一年之內曾四次下令停戰，尚且每次遭受共黨的破壞，何況今天中共還始終不肯答應停戰呢？在安慶城郊江邊，共軍進攻已近十天，大有非打下安慶不可之勢。同時，更在武漢的背面西面，作雙管齊下的夾攻，政府軍隊儘管後撤，共軍卻儘管，這樣得寸進尺的攻擊，在共軍自必有當年苻堅「投鞭斷流」的勇氣，企圖一鼓而渡長江。中共廣播要把政府肯不肯拿辦「戰犯」作為立即停戰倒真是有無和平誠意的試金石了。</p>
<p>第四，和談要成功，切忌胡扯到題外去做文章，使得愈走愈遠。譬如大西洋公約昨日由十二國外長在華府簽訂，和我們中國原沒相干，中國並不是大西洋沿岸的國家，更不必將這個問題牽到和談範圍內去。但據電傳，中共準備在和談中增提一項對外政策的條件，就是要未來的聯合政府完全傾向蘇聯，一致反對美國及西歐各國。這難是外國記者猜測之詞，但觀於中共電臺的廣播，毛澤東李濟琛等發表聯合聲明，一致反對大西洋公約，並公然宣言，「將團結全國人民，與中國的盟友蘇聯搶手並進，向侵略戰爭的發動者做堅決的鬥爭，打敗侵略者」，不能不令人相信中共確是有意把中國拖去做蘇聯的尾巴，亂跑亂闖，甚至捲入國際戰爭的漩渦以為快。假使中共代表在和談中果欲提出此項問題，政府代表深懷民意之可畏，當不敢貿然附和，而和平或就在此點擱淺。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕一九四八年美國援華法雖於三日期滿，但經濟合作總署仍將努力推行援華計劃，充分利用援華法下餘款五千四百萬元，今後計劃大約將側重中國非共產區域之農村復興工作。中美農村復興委員會美籍委員莫耶現在此間草擬下期（一九四九年四月至一九五〇年二月）之預算，該會大約可獲一千萬元至一千五百萬元。據莫耶稱，本委員會現僅開步，將來始能大步邁進，本會工作注重土地改革，灌溉，種子改良，動物疾病防止，衛生，家庭改良與民眾教育等工作，工作區域在臺灣，廣西，福建與四川等區。過去一年本委員會經費大部份仰給於中國方面，今後則擬將仰給於美國。土地改革之目的，在將大地主之土地移轉至個別地主，地主與農民雙方對此頗能合作，土地改革計劃一旦完成，農民之生活標準卽可提高。灌漑方面，本會已收到中國方面之種種議案，卽將加以審查。</p>

<p>〔本報青島四日電〕青警備部人員貪汚案，本報繼續調查結果，續有驚人發現。據關係方面透露，此案破獲龐大販毒機構中之一枝節，另有高級官員牽涉。</p>
<p>據透露消息：該販毒機關卽為金鄉路六十九號源豐水產行土產，主犯宋紹初·劉品三·余錫候業已被捕在押，宋為經理，另有副理韓某，竟於宋等被捕之次日返回源豐時，以預先備就之假身份證，曚混軍警，且在加以拘捕時以武力抗拒兎脫。小港檢查站所查獲之十麻袋金圓券，卽與該號有關係，自海西用木船運來青島。經理宋某平日塲面闊綽，神通廣大，勾結不肖官兵。警備部據查獲金圓線索，參謀長黃公魯卽手令卽晚搜查該號，由軍警憲會同，先將金鄉路六十九號包圍，排戶入內。</p>
<p>不要黃金　只要腦袋</p>
<p>宋等情知不妙，當塲打開銀箱，露出黃金·美鈔·大頭，數目不可估計，總値當有數百兩，並稱諸位不必優，請隨便拿。搜查人員鑒宋等雖頗有「白相人派頭」，相當「落檻，「但益證此中文章，宋且歷數某人某人都有來往等語，旋取黃金五十兩行賄，搜查人員稱太少，宋又加五十兩，復稱太少，宋問究要多少，乃答以此案太大，要你的腦袋才好，宋稱旣如此只有跟你們走，於是被捕，並搜得與共區華東貿易局來往販運煙土賬單，其主要去路則為銷售上海。</p>
<p>名片借款　蛛絲馬跡</p>
<p>並抄獲名片數百張，多為地方人物，以名片索借若干萬，以應急需，所署日期多在陰歷年底，不無蛛絲馬跡可尋。該督察長張通等匿報金圓券數額貪汚事之敗露，亦係宋某神通之結果，原擬活動發回，不意弄巧成拙，而使多人難堪。檢查站站長余敬臣一度逃匿，旋卽自首，其自白貪汚經過書，長達五十餘頁十行紙，說明渠祗分得黃金一兩，至如何支配該項匿報款項，則全係參謀長黃公魯手筆指示。張通之黃金美鈔等證物，則在審訊時當堂自其身上抄獲。參謀長黃公魯名義上為改調綏區高參，實已予看管。</p>
<p>走私事件　層出不窮</p>

<h3 id="c100">常州古墓準備開掘 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　李天行</p>
<p>〔本報武港三日訊〕常州南郊靑龍橋惲家墩發現古墓的事，已隨着季候的春風轟傳遐邇了。因為春來多風雨，濕透了原野。地方又値軍事倥偬，征兵征糧，鬧得十分緊張，對於發掘工作，尚遲遲未曾進行。現在第二次的發掘會議，決定在本月九日邀集滬寗兩地專家如蔣大沂，楊寬正和南京中央博物硏究院的曾昭　先生等作決定性的開掘會議。幷以卅石米為第一步開掘費，假定事實無其他枝節。十日卽可正式開工發掘了！</p>
<p>兩週以來，地方彥碩，外來專家，以及一般野老村叟，對着這個謎一般的古墓，言論紛披，恰如戲劇揭幕前，應有十番「鬧台鑼鼓」，一樣的動人而可愛。搜求，蒐集，把牠一片片地連綴起來，一字字的紀載起來，為古代文化拾荒，這是筆者寫本文的動機。</p>
<p>靑龍橋輪廓綫</p>
<p>步出小南門，循着現在的武宜路，大約一里多路，就到靑龍橋的鄕下了！那裏在過去俗稱茶山路，有頭，二，三，三個茶亭。「長亭十里，古道斜陽」。在憑岡四望，一般郊外應有的荒凉意味，是瀰漫着。荒塚壘壘，草麥靑靑，很可以遙念到古城的過去，自會悠然「發思古之幽情」！靑龍橋，已沒有橋了！附近阡陌縱橫，平岡淺丘，隨意點綴。惲家墩是附近一個比較豐隆而特大的邱墓。墩的西旁不百步路，便是一個小村叫惲家村。墩的西北面，接着是所靑龍橋小學，學校校舍，原先是當地的土地廟。現在還保留着幾尊金身的佛像。這個所在，叫荒凉不算荒凉，叫不算荒凉，却帶有着荒凉的意味。</p>
<p>古墓的發現，是偶然的事。據惲家村的居民說。去年年底五十二軍駐節常州，看中了這座高墳，於是就在上面，深溝高壘，構築城防工事，當挖進一丈多深，發見大批磚石，工作也就算了。今年新正，附近村民發見許多磚塊，於我取爾拿，愈挖愈多。村民很天眞，只知取磚塊是可以補塲地，可以補墻缺，根本不管「古不古」。但是無意中一個古墓第一室，就無情的給他們挖光，他們也不知是什麼回事。當時據說拿到古錢。古銅劍，反正泥土滿面，旣霉又爛的東西，大家都不經意的丟散了！</p>
<p>到三月十二日，城防工事又重新開端，在挖掘的過程中忽然發現了第二道拱門，幷窺探其中尚有墓洞，於是古墓這名始傳出，十五日本地各報記者，羣趨探訪，全城民衆，夾道爭往觀看。縣府和綏靖司令部城防部始正式加以保護，計議發掘。</p>
<p>古墓磚花紋奇</p>
<p>現在所發現的古墓，據一般說已是墓的第二室，第一室在無意中被鄕民為取用磚頭，掘光了。第二室的門腔是拱形。朝南向。闊約三尺餘。高約四尺餘。入內約有五六尺見方的一室。室內潮濕異常，地上全為碎泥塡堆，不見底磚，頂上則全為磚側面緊砌，花紋淸晰，古雅深致。正面壁間，則現一門腔，東壁間，亦現一門腔，較正面的略為低矮。兩門堂均用塊磚側密緊砌，尚未開掘。</p>
<p>關於墓磚，現在筆者所見，已有三種圖紋。磚塊一律是長方形，闊寬厚俱相等（見卅一日本報）全部墓磚殊有特製或定製的意味。圖紋大同小異。重蕉葉紋，及疊人字形。見附圖。古錢圖案上文字說明，到現在止，還未能一定，據同濟大學教授蔣大沂先生考究，可能是「大全五百」與「大全五千」。惟「全」可能為「泉」之省寫。「大全五百」「大全五千」均為三國吳大帝孫權嘉禾五年所製貨幣。以此而推此墓當在孫之後，又據王壽象考證「目」字中多一橫，為古「良」字「良全」亦與通寳之之義相通。爪字形疑為「鳳」字之半。則如紀輕重，則為「五銖良全」，如紀年號則為「五鳳良全」。亦通。又有陳豐園先生，對磚紋釋文稱「兩圓圈形中各范四字均僅有三字淸晰，一為「五」字，一為「全」字，一為「目」中多一橫，按此為古良字，不可釋作「百」。百字古文從「一」從「自」。非如古文「良」之於長框中加三橫徵之金石文亦然。莊子列御寇「　胡堂視其良，阮為秋柏之實矣」，釋文「良者良人，或作垠，音浪，冡也」。其漫漶之字如為「大」，「大」亦古文「人」字。則倂合此四字當為「五人全良」卽「五人全家」，或「全家五人」。關於文字考證，現在已有這幾種硏究。</p>
<p>楊有潤談見解</p>
<p>本地有位楊有潤先生，他是在中央硏究院歷史語言考古組工人，他發表了九點意見。（一）磚邊重疊人字形，係漢墓所特有。（二）東九省甘肅等地，均有發見。足證此項花紋為漢代風尚。流傳極廣。（三）漢墓磚面古錢花紋極多，惟靑龍橋發見者，則過去並未見過。（四）磚上文字，過去從未見過，無從確斷，是何年代。（五）漢代墓磚用錢花紋，係當時習尚，不必定是帝王將相。（六）磚上古錢文字，不一定與死者時代吻合。亦不一定為當時所用錢幣式樣。（七）從大體觀察南門外之古墓，當為漢墓，或離漢不遠。（八）此墓可能早已盜過。（九）盜過之墓仍有發掘之價値，南門外古墓範圍極廣，似非普通人民所葬。此外又有曹博如，依據歷史性，習慣性，推定該墓可能為楊惲墓。陸蠢園則稱此墩旣稱惲事墩當與惲氏有關。黃山寺碑記云「吾惲氏第一世漢梁相國貞道府君，自安定來居毗陵。」則惲氏自漢已遷居來常。惲氏自有宗派，不可與「楊惲」混為一談，楊惲墓恐不可信。</p>
<p>古陵墓有跡象</p>
<p>據王壽祥的墓考：武進縣誌及常州府誌，都載有古陵墓所在地，武時誌，齊高帝泰安陵在通江鄕，武帝景安陵，明帝與安陵，梁武帝父女帝建陵，均書在鄕，但在何處，則不可知。三國吳大將軍左都護諸葛瑾墓在懷北鄕，又宋墓在懷南懷北鄕者，有張守，王逢原，丁寳臣等。常州府誌齊泰安陵在通江鄕彭山，景安陵齊武帝所葬，興安陵齊明帝及敬后劉氏所葬。興地誌云泰安，景安，興安三陵在故闌陵東北金牛山。以上所述諸陵，此處（指南郊）或係南齊高帝寢陵。高帝名蕭道成，南蘭陵人。（武進舊名南闌陵）受禪稱帝在位四年，據南史建元四年四月葬於武進泰安陵。府誌載泰安景安興安三陵均在故闌陵東北。相傳古蘭陵位今城之南郊，則今城之南郊，可能為故蘭陵城之東北。又該地名靑龍橋，可能亦因蕭陵則命名。以上所述，均為初步考證。均摘要綜合報導，都可作來日為參證資料。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行金融平準委員會昨晨循例在中行會議室集會，討論結果，為穩定發行大鈔及發薪時期後市塲可能引起之漲風，決恢復全面拋售政策，物資方面，除國行及美援花紗布聯營處大量拋紗，台糖公司大量售糖外，中央銀行昨復在金市無限制供售黃金，儘市塲需要無限應售，結果前後共售去六千餘大條，創拋售以來之空前新紀錄，各方納胃已到達飽和點，致早晨六七十元之日拆，至下午三四時許，竟步昇至二百元關外，銀根又是空前奇緊。據國行某關係當局表示：「若干行莊大量吃進條子後，除非後來設法彌縫，必將有十餘家因無法軋平頭寸，而趨於倒閉之途」。</p>
<p>又國行業務局局長林崇墉昨於答覆記者詢問時，面露勝利之笑容，渠稱：「市塲有多大胃口，我們今天決議儘量供給，吃到肚子脹死了，那也怪不得我們了！」旋林氏反問記者：「今天物價如何？」各記者均報稱轉跌，林氏連呼好好不止，狀至得意。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨銀根不緊，日拆在千元七十元至八十元間。至九時五十分，金價漲停板，國行開始作無限制拋售，銀根轉緊，至十一時後日拆已高至九十至一百元。迄午因浮多了結，暗息略降，日拆回至八十五至九十五元。但市塲旋卽獲悉國行拋量巨大，各業頭寸均緊，且風聞票據不能抵用，暗息上海，故收盤後之暗息，高至日拆每千元一百五十元至二百五十元，開以往未有之記錄。若干行莊因頭寸未能軋平，情勢險惡，國行乃於晚間以九九〇之行情，收進黃金，供給頭寸，暗息較降，約為日拆二百元左右。聞有小銀行兩家，因頭寸關係，今起停止交換。</p>
<h3 id="c109">國行儘量拋售　金價百萬進關 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市塲變幻莫測，市勢動盪不定，晨間因二天拆息關係，開盤卽掛一二五萬六千漲停。中逢因人心堅定，屹立高峯多時，十一時光景，央行委託大德成金號以一二五萬價格無限制拋售，猛出達六一六三大條，軋進頭寸七百七十億〇三千七百五十萬之鉅。人心轉軟，浮多爭相了售，散戶紛紛出籠，一路小至一二一萬五千，午收稍升至一二二萬。</p>
<p>午後因銀根緊俏，暗息昂達二元左右，各方買氣消散，市勢欲漲乏力，開盤一一九萬，微高至一二〇萬。金號幫證劵幫紛紛有了，小至一一〇萬，臨收一刻鐘益形不支，在廣幫銀行幫競　下，市况直綫猛瀉，一路跌進百萬大關，低達九九萬，收盤勉站九九萬三千。較上週末反軋小五萬四千。同業劃賬交易，上午為一二三萬五千，下午亦退至一〇九萬五千。</p>
<p>塲外</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕塲外交易活絡，晨開一二六萬，一二七萬，高至一二七萬，一二二萬三千。午後開盤一一九萬五千，一二〇萬〇五千，高至一二一萬五千，一二二萬五千，低至一一七萬五千，一一八萬，收盤一一八萬五千，一一九萬，亦回降八萬五千。隔日每兩加息十四萬，喊高至一三二萬五千，一三三萬。</p>
<p>飾金</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀樓飾金一波三折，上午掛一二二萬，一三二萬，下午升至一三〇萬，一四二萬，最後又低至一二八萬，一四〇萬，較上週末獨加二七萬。飾銀亦漲二千，高至一二八萬三，一萬五。錢兌業烚赤，上午掛一二五萬，一二八萬，中午低至一一八萬，一二一萬，下午未更。</p>
<p>美鈔</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日美鈔塲外晨開二萬五，二萬六，高至二萬六千五，二萬七千五，低至二萬四，二萬五，午收二萬四千五，二萬七千五，午後趨勢尚平，開盤二萬四千五，二萬五千五，中途因頭寸奇緊，各方需求寥落，低至二萬三千五，二萬四千五，收盤二萬四，二萬五。較上週末回跌一千。隔日加息三千，喊高至二萬七，二萬八。</p>
<p>銀元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元套匯頗多，長沙方面以銀元套匯，而以金圓劵作價，匯水每百元高八元，低六元，票匯為申莊票據，見票遲一天介付，折合當地銀元價格，電匯匯水較票匯高出甚多。但亦有倒匯者，卽由申莊與客家直接用電報託收，收到後由上海交付當日之銀元相等價格。平津方面，北幫套做十五天板期相等價格。平津方面，北幫套做十五天板期票匯，套做價可直過，不取匯費，卽以當日交匯之銀元折合價。十五天以後，由對方付款相等之銀元。聞美金套匯，亦有做開，惟數目不多，大都零星之贍家款，以避免人民劵與金圓劵之折合損失。</p>
<p>馬路交易，初堅後疲，晨開大頭喊二萬二，二萬三，午後因金價猛跌，執戶紛紛出籠，自二萬一，二萬二，步小至傍晚喊低至二萬，二萬一。小頭喊一萬五，一萬六，龍鷹洋喊一萬一，一萬二。錢兌幫對敲大頭，當日支票初做二萬四，二萬六，後亦小至二萬二，二萬三，較上週微升一千。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華股市况，昨日高開低收，市程走勢曲折，塲上多空夾擊，走勢屢仆屢起，惟因上週漲勢俏過持放，人心又見好轉，而業外游資，不斷歸流，故新買甚湧，若無拋金威脅，則升勢仍勁。永紗晨開十八元高盤，聞金銀市塲昨起放寬限額，同行壓力必強，大戶頗為敏感，晨起抬面空勢甚盛，行情小至十七元。旋聞國庫支撥軍政費款，數達三百億流出，銀根鬆象環轉，暗息還至六角，塲外貼息亦低至七角，七角五，內外新買湧起，銀行幫證劵幫及大戶鄭重仁等力進，又升至十八元三角五分。嗣後央行大量拋金，塲外空方活躍，市勢又見回挫，低至十七元二角。紗幫再托，又升至十八元一角。近午銀根緊象立見，多頭無力掙扎，終至十七元六角午收。</p>
<p>中小型股，均以高盤開出，午收又見回平。信和新光一度漲停，新華百貨統益永公台糖等均紛登限度，勤興福華豐等亦一致向昂，其餘各股開後均昂，午收平定。</p>
<p>後市銀根劇緊，暗息奇昂，金業幫認證劵幫求單殷切，日拆喊高至二元左右，浮賣再起，市况初開帶軟，嗣因銀根緊後轉舒，前市浮空遞補，臨收又吿回升，終創十九元一角高價。</p>
<p>塲外交易，初做一七元三角，跌至十六元〇五分，最後以十六元七收市。其餘各股，均較前市回挺，成交四六億三三四〇萬股</p>

<h3 id="c112">市塲散步 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 看台客</p>
<p>風潮大得可怕　行莊全面搖動</p>
<p>昨天市面萬分嚴重，毋寗說今天市面，更要嚴重。</p>
<p>硬崩崩的×四行×四行等等大行莊，都說要停止本票抵現了。昨晚什九都差出，大小行莊都連夜工作。擺不平的，在筆者執筆為止，尚有五六十家之多。</p>
<p>這個風潮，可說是勝利以來破天荒第一次。因為央行在傍午大甩條子，所以大家把這筆賬算在央行身上。而央行，當然把這筆賬算在昨天上午的各種市價全面狂漲上。</p>
<p>現在，不是推諉責任的問題，而是如何過門的問題。昨晚，央行大開門，白天金價昂到一千二百多萬，央行也從一千一二百萬高價甩出的。可是深晚，央行照九百萬收進，拆出頭寸維持行莊。這筆錢，可說賺得木佬佬。</p>
<p>從打擊投機而論，手段不可謂不辣。但是開放金銀等投機交易的是誰？什麼呌打擊投機？提倡投機在前，而以打擊在後，這不是跟商人開玩笑是什麼？</p>
<p>從穩定市面而論，那末決不能以如此這般的公開市塲政策所辦得到的，隊非澈底收拾收拾一番。</p>
<p>本市大小行莊如此之多，執照都是財政部發的。弄到如此地步，財政部不能不負全部責任。</p>
<p>一個最嚴重的問題，某某等有停止本票抵用之說。這又成何體統。本票可以停止抵用，卽是發票行莊的信用掃地。怎麼還可以許其存在？</p>
<p>但發票行莊也攤得出理由，因為他沒有現鈔頭寸。那末責任又在央行身上。</p>
<p>其實，着急是多餘的，看罷，倒不是「船到橋頭自會直」，而是央行和這批大老板，都是脚碰脚。面子夾裏做到。大家都可以安然過去，倒霉的，還是廠商及手裏還拿着本票的一般人。</p>
<p>從今天，全市商民應該記記了，在濫發本票的今日拿本票實在是危險。老實說，殷實廠商的支票，比行莊信用有過之無不及。現在許多人選擇本票，不歡迎支票，這是最易上當的錯覺。</p>
<p>撇開這風潮不說，進而再講講市面的影響吧，第一就是股市會摜倒，大多頭鄭重臣來不及出籠，那末昨晚拆息高至三元五角多，把算盤撥一撥，不是望廿元就可以過關了。但是挺得住嗎？難說，眞眞難說了。</p>
<p>至於一般商品市塲，同樣會摜得發呆，不過，重要的，不會影響到零售市價，小市民漲是有份，跌是沒份的。</p>
<p>算到金鈔銀元，昨晚也被拖落得很兇。可是萬變不離宗，大局頗有注意的必要。</p>
<p>商品儘管摜得發呆　小市民得不到好處</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本年度跑馬　棒球公開賽，已由主辦者國際體育會在積極籌備中，將於最近期內開始比賽，參加隊伍甚多，盛況還減去年。壘球界各方面負責人及球隊斡事，日來正為籌辦種種手續而忙於奔走，針對裁判人才荒而設立之裁判訓練班亦已開始授課。</p>
<p>上屆冠軍國人勁旅熊貓隊鑒於壘球之迫在眉睫，為保持過去令　計，已開始苦練，每星期日在交通大學球場練習二小時。仍由「熊貓之父」梁扶出先生指導。陣容方面，捕手曹克家已去台灣，最近期內還可能回滬，故捕手一職，改由老將王慶瑞充任，慶瑞久脫手套，球藝未免疏，但經數次苦練，已漸稪舊觀。又熊貓並羅致交大分健兒二位助陣。</p>
<p>女子方面，稱雄一時之亞軍　燈隊，尚未見開始活動。該隊投手上海全運代表程莫蘭，足部受傷，今年恐還復能再奔走球場。三壘蔡賓球，一　股貽　已分赴廣州香港。故今年　燈可能與中西女校之浣熊了合併，選精擷華，再與番幫之子兒較短長云。</p>

<p>〔香港航訊〕四月一是爲草地公開網球賽之雙打決賽期，亦即全賽之壓軸戲，由徐家雙傑煒培潤培賽業觀雄與李惠堂，觀眾之多，為各場之冠，經一小時又廿分之劇戰後，徐家昆仲終因默契較深，卒以三對一再得勝利，第七次　有香港雙打錦標。計兩徐於一九三六年初得雙打錦標，隨後於一九二八·三九·四一等年，俱橫掃香港，一九四三至四六，本港淪陷　手，未有舉賽，戰後於一九四七年，重開賽會，三也雙打錦標，亦悉歸彼　，功業彪炳，可喜可賀也。至於自有硬地公開賽以來，雙打錦標未嘗一入別人之手，又戰後之男女混合雙打公開賽錦標，亦兩歸徐家與其配搭之女子，則不入本題，茲不養矣。</p>
<p>慢熱之徐家昆仲，仍是初賽時大失水準，尤以大徐為甚，錯誤百出，再加以葉觀雄演出至佳，李惠堂亦有極佳之演出，由是時李一路領先，直下五局，而後見兩徐能取回一局，第七局兩徐又敗，於是葉李以六對一大勝，雄威特盛，幾控制全場，第一局葉先發球，只失兩點即勝，最後一　，為李惠堂高壓成功，第二局潤培發球，會賽成平手二次，而卒為葉所敗，第三局由惠堂發球，亦賽成一度平手而葉李卒勝，最後一記惠開球力勁，小徐一出手即落網，第四局煒培發球亦敗，第五局葉會發出愛司球，突使大徐無從捉摸，此局在劇戰中，觀雄會於躍起高壓時，不慎扭傷足踝，然仍能奮戰僅失一點而又勝，至第五局完後，乃急加穿上橡皮護踝而後繼賽，然奔走疾捷之處，已顯未如前，故輸去第六局，而後再發奮勝第七局而獲第一盤勝利，此盤共賽十五分鍾，葉觀雄有「愛司」球一次，四人俱無雙錯誤，以點數　，則葉李組共得三十記，兩徐僅獲九記。</p>
<p>第二盤之始，兩徐水準仍未盡複，大徐先發球，雖三度趕回平局仍卒敗，第二局葉發球，僅失一點又勝，至是葉跑時微見彳亍不密，兩徐乘機發動攻勢，葉因奔走不甚便，惟有改取守勢，於是兩追回二對二局面，但第五局煒培又因一記大意球而複敗，仍被葉李以三對二領先，至是急起直追連下二局，初以四對三領先，第八局葉氏神威大發，取速戰速決手法，又進回四對四平手，至此兩徐即合力向惠堂進攻，每迫李出於撀其素不大善之地上球，於是第九局開始獲淨利，第十局亦只失一點即勝，於是兩徐以六對四取回第二盤，成一對一局面，此盤亦絕無雙錯誤，葉有「愛司」球一交，共費廿三分鍾乃畢事，計兩徐此盤獲點三十五，葉李二十八，人謂葉傷踝後尚能領前至於第五局，倘葉非不幸受傷，則情勢或不如是，敬李葉能再勝第二盤，則兩徐本年能否再保有雙打錦標賽未可知，主非過甚之辭也。</p>
<p>第二盤兩徐先勝一淨局，而後連的二局，至第四局，惠堂會於緊張局面中發出雙錯誤球，又被兩徐追成二對二平避，在大徐開球局下，又見雙雄發奪，惠堂演出亦佳，於是兩徐再以二對三落後，至是兩徐實現水準，會以淨利破時開球局，直取得五對二領先之利，而發球局被葉李追回四比五。第十局雖由葉發球，仍無法遏止兩徐進展，於是兩徐又勝六對四，此盤亦賽二十三分鍾，兩徐共獲卅五點，葉李廿七點，全盤無愛司球，而惠堂有雙錯誤一次。</p>
<p>第四盤初兩局猶有劇戰，俱平手多次而後勝利卒屬兩徐，此後大徐已漸見水準盡複，且每以高球或地球向惠堂壓退，於是直下三局，輸回第四局，又直下三局，取得六對一勝利，或三對一之比而再奪錦標。此盤雖局數距離甚遠，仍　廿一分鍾而後畢事，計兩徐共獲卅四點，葉李獲廿三點，全場計數，兩徐勝一百二十三記，葉李取一百零八記，賽後由港大副監督兼自衛軍司令官賴總之女公子主持領獎禮，而後菜會。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽甲一組已成尾聲，尚餘最後三戰，爲明日之海青隊恩卡斯，及星期五（八日）滬營對海青，及華聯對恩卡斯，至此甲一組比賽全部完畢。至於甲一組及女子組冠亞季軍名次全部決定，華聯之盟主葉已坐定，即使敗於恩卡斯，亦無問題。亞軍仁餘，如滬營勝海青，與回力並列季軍。恩卡斯如勝海青而敗於華聯，即列第五名，萬一失冷門，能擊退冠軍華聯，則與回力滬營同等級。女子組已全部賽畢，綠隊保持不敗之冠軍，亞軍黎隊，季軍星華，第四約翰，殿軍力隊。茲將甲一組即女子組各隊勝負成績列下：</p>

<p>籃球聯賽今晚甲一駔輸穿，三塲秩序，全爲甲二組，仍自下午五時半開始，在體育館角逐，門券介極照舊。首先二B回力對合爲，回力三戰三勝與警機同保不敗，奪標呼聲最高，合眾實力較為平庸，自難望有所作爲，故回力必可順利奏現凱。第二場甲二C健樂對培爾，健樂自擊退美氣後眾後，冠軍希望轉渡，今日如勝，則戰績與美軍並等，將視得失分而判高下矣。培爾兩勝兩負，論門力尚稱不弱，但健樂士氣正旺，恐駐免作城下之盟。末場爲甲二A康隊對暴風雨，康隊陣線　挺，擁有陸大及　勳兩仗，先後以一二分之差敗北，殊為可惜。暴風雨為南縸同學所組成，合作雖佳，但難敵康隊之凶猛也。三場秩序如下：回力——合衆（甲二B）五時卅分　健樂——培爾（甲二C）六時卅分　康隊——暴風雨（甲二A）七時卅分</p>

<p>— 王心景著　陳霖笙校　（六）</p>
<p>擺動力的發生，完全跟著拍球動力來的。照物理學的定則，擺動時，擺幅愈大，擺動的速率愈大，發生的力量也愈大；擺動的含有加速率的，那麼發生的力量就更大。我們在拍球之先，手臂必向後曳，這是增大擺幅；拍的時候，動作敏捷，這是求速率的大；手腕較手臂的擺幅更大，擺動更快，這是加速度。要是拍球時，手不後曳，甚至球拍著球即停止動作，那麼拍出來的球，勢必觸網，而死於網內，這是因為擺幅小的缘故。手臂自後向前進行，倘使慢慢的向前，那麼拍的球也絕無拍到對方的希望，這是速率小的缘故。手腕隨臂擺動，而不用力，那麼球勢必弱，這是沒有加速率的缘故。所以球的有「力」沒有「力」，和擺幅的大小，擺動的快慢，關系是很大的。</p>
<p>初學的人，往往因使用肌力過甚，致動股與對抗肌同時緊張，關節呆滯，擺動目難流利，就是動肌的實力，也受其消滅，每有肌力和擺動力並用，往往不及原用一力來得有力，其實擺動宜自然，肌肉應放權，習之既久，自能曉得兩力並用的好處的。</p>
<p>拍乒乓單單有力還是沒用，還得注意「準」的一點。這種「方向的節制」，控制球的能力，和手臂擺動的方向，乒乓拍的偏正，力的著點，來球的方向，……都有重大的關係。這「準」的功夫，經過相當時間的練習，就不難心領神會的。</p>

<h3 id="c124">夢遊與巫师 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>記得三月某日，本談登過一篇關於「夢遊症」的文章。由此，使我想起了故鄉一　似夢遊的巫术來。</p>
<p>在我故鄉的廟宇裏，供奉著許多聞名遐邇的菩薩。那些菩薩的名字，因為太著名了，所以即使對於故鄉不太十分熟悉的我，也略知幾個，如：三老爺，賀大元帥，石靈官，二靈官，袁長師等等。鄉人每遇危難當前，就唸著他們的法號的。生了病，把他們的金駕接到家裏，沏一杯茶，在菩薩面前供一供，彈些香灰掉入茶裏，病人喝下就會好；這是輕病。要是重病呢？那就不簡單了。這時，或者一方面求名醫，一方面接名菩薩；或者，縈性不要醫生，完全靠菩薩。通常每一個菩薩，都有一個固定的巫师，我們鄉下稱「弟子」。這種「弟子」，平時是普通的農夫，工匠，一到他們所跟隨的菩薩要為人治病時，卻忽然就「神」氣起來了。</p>
<p>治病的方式有多種，這裏僅就一般的情形說一說：所謂「弟子」者躺在床上沉沉地睡覺，廳堂裏供著菩薩，金鼓齊嗚，燒香焚紙，請菩薩降臨。有時這樣鬧一夜，菩薩一來，是甚麼情形呢？那就是「弟子」忽然從睡夢中躍起，祼著上半身，不住宅區地劇烈地發抖，奔到廳堂裏，跳躍舞蹈。然後在神前桌上，指書口講，往往本是一個目不識丁的人，這時能吟出文雅的詩句（可惜我現在不能舉出那睦詩句來）。作好了詩，便開藥方了。所開藥方，都是些稀奇古怪，不近情理的東西，例如：鹅糞，某種泥土，也被開列出來。所可怪的，病人吃下去，縱不奏效，也無甚妨害。藥方開畢，「弟子」忽然大呼「吾神去也」，仰後便倒。大家把他扶住，伏於桌上片刻，就恢復常態了。</p>
<p>在「弟子」睡覺的時候，有時旁人在外　聽，可以聽到他呢呢喃喃，仿佛與人對談似的，據說這是在跟菩薩打交道呢！</p>
<p>此外，有一種很少的情形是：「弟子」發作時，可以在尖利的刀鋒上。</p>
<p>上面所記，在我鄕中，他們是言之鑒鑒的。因為這把戲在表面上看來，類似於夢遊症，所以姑妄記之。</p>
<h3 id="c125">券與圈 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 曲辰</p>
<p>有人說：金圓券的「券」，不忍看作「圈」解。　理由是：「券」發得越多，物價表上的「圈」是也加得越多嗎？　另一方面，小百姓的身子，也似乎被這莫明其妙的「圈」，一圈一圈地越箍越緊，簡直透不過氣來了。　然則，誰又能說，此「券」不是那「圈」呢！</p>
<h3 id="c126">散原翁善志 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>美國大文學家馬克吐溫，一日傍晚出外散步，遇著一郵差，停步問：「有我的信沒有？」，郵差說：「好的，請問先生的名字？」馬克吐溫搔首想了半天，終究想不起來，只好忸怩著說：等我回家去問問吧，郵差一笑而去。</p>
<p>宋江裨類鈔有記王文正公旦善忘一則：「且有一控馬卒，差滿請辭。公問曰：汝擰吾馬已幾時；對曰五年矣。公怪曰，何以吾不省有汝？薄贈遣之。既去復呼回曰，汝竟是某人耶？對曰然，遂再厚贈之。　其人平時控馬，公但見其背，未見其面，故不省識，及去復見其背，始識爲某人也。」</p>
<p>人對於自己的姓名會忘記，對於自己用五年的控馬卒，竟不認識其面，世人必有不相信此等怪事者。餘所知散原翁一軼事，其善忘不下於古人，頗可發笑，茲一述之。</p>
<p>散原翁本住南京青溪上四條巷宅，辛亥雙十起義，南京張動與民軍戰，散原翁與家人來滬，居老靶子路。民元回江西南昌之西山上塚還，江輪靠岸，其仆擁運行李，為散原翁僱一馬車，及到老靶子路，一排洋房，格式相同，散原翁竟不得其門而入，不知何宅為彼之家，門牌號數，又不記得。馬車徘徊於馬路上久之際，馬夫說你能認得那裏房子？散原翁言那裏大洋房，我認得。重慶路李公館為李經義（曾於清季任雲貴總督）住宅，此處為裏弄房子，僅靠威海衛路有一大洋房，故散原翁能認識無誤。李木公兄（名國松，經義之子，學古文於散原翁），代為開銷馬車錢，另僱一馬車，派人送歸。此種不認得自己住處之善忘，恐非散原翁不能有之也。</p>
<h3 id="c127">「內子」並非「內人」 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 翼飛</p>
<p>禮：「曾子曰：大夫內子·」注曰：「內子，妻也。」故人稱其妻，宜曰「內子」，不當曰：「內人」。今人對客自稱妻曰：「內人」，此大謬也。按「內人」在唐時為妓女之稱，唐張祐詩：「內人已唱春鶯囀，柳下傞傞輕舞來」。崔令欽教坊記曰：「妓女入宜春院，謂之內人」。內人乃唐時官妓，遇大宴會，辄令歌以侑酒，類於今日本之藝妓。今人以妓女之稱　　，　乃唐突已甚。</p>
<p>妓女或稱表子，校書。妓女別稱表子，元時即以巽於「內子」，猶言外婦了。校書，則為蜀人呼妓女之稱。胡曾贈薛濤詩曰：「萬裏橋邊薛校書，琵琶底下閉門居。」又昔人以妓司觴政，故曰　糾，亦曰錄事。但不知所錄何事也。</p>
<h3 id="c128">讀愚人節新聞 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 春宜</p>
<p>東西間冷戰雖到了白熱化狀態，「愚人節」這天彼此開開小玩笑，似乎還無傷大雅。但就「四一」這天新聞記者所制造的「僞新聞」來看，技術上實在不值得恭維。以上海來說吧，張學良釋放的消息，雖然也會有人去國際飯店打聽，但根據一個能幹的新聞記者常用字識上的判斷，釋放張學良在現在戰霧彌漫的空氣裏，可能性定必甚少。我說常識上的判斷，就是指在目前局勢下，張一時還不會離開「讀書養性」的臺灣。</p>
<p>再說「白銀借貸成功」的第二件大新聞，當五萬十萬大鈔即將滿天飛舞，又一個財政經濟改革方案將公布實施之時，稍稍熟知一點美國對中國情勢的人，一定馬上會否定這個玩笑的。</p>
<p>根據以上兩個「愚人新聞」，我才下個斷語：製造這新聞的人，技術普不高明。稍稍有一點政治常識與「新聞鼻」的人，都會聳聳肩膀，說聲：見鬼！</p>
<p>第三件新聞是：公務員的薪金將改發銀圓。消息很好，全中國三百多萬公務員都將為之皆大歡喜，但根據條二條「白銀貸款」如若一天沒有希望，這個「美麗的夢」也會馬上粉碎的。所以，這條「僞造」新聞更無根據。</p>
<p>至於製造「喜訊」，猶可一說；而指人「服毒自殺」則不單不值得效法，而且居心也很可怕。</p>
<p>其實「萬愚節」今年最大的新聞還是「和談」。它不先不後，剛剛挑中了「四一」，細玩意味，這個玩笑可開得不大不小啊。</p>

<p>看過巴金小說「家」底人，對於中國封建家庭底黑暗與專制藥廠，自然會發生反感的。現在來看弗德立馬區主演底電影「家」(曾在美琪上映)，天下烏鴉一般黑，美國底家庭一樣地充滿了壓迫，專橫，猜忌與自私，最後逼得一個有良心的主婦——麗弗尼不得不棄家出走。</p>
<p>和「亂世佳人」一樣，「家」是以美國南北戰爭期間底一段故事作爲背景的。在南北戰皺中中因經商發財底馬克司，於南美小村中擁有雜貨鋪一所。馬愛財若命，吝啬成性，一心在錢上打主意。長子彭，是一個奸詐狡猾的人，但在頑固的老父控制下，祇能　　不得志地做著鋪子裏的管帳先生。次子奧司加，愚蠢而抖亂，戀愛一個十三點的小舞女，因為老父不肯給錢，使結婚的希望歸於幻滅。幼女麗其娜，一個早熟的姑娘，撒嬌，放肆、謊騙，先把老父騙得團團轉，等到她長兄得勢時，她馬上就又轉過來，迎合她底長兄了。馬妻麗弗尼，是一個有良心底女人，因丈夫在戰爭期間曾囤積居奇，搜括致富，又曾引北軍入境，屠殺村民，麗曾目睹，良心上當感痛苦，想創辦一所醫院來贖罪，但馬不肯給錢。後來馬驅逐長子離家，麗憤而宣洩了這十多年來的秘密，長子知道了以後，以此為要挾，逼馬寫字據，以一元代價將全部財產交長子執管。長子掌握大權以後，麗再向長子要錢建造醫院，意外地竟亦遭拒絕，使麗覺悟了這一家底人都沒有人性，憤然離開了這個值不得留戀的家。</p>
<p>「家」底主題是什麼呢？是說明一個家庭中如果沒有共同的信念，沒有良好的教育，沒有和諧的感情，光是有錢，並不是幸福的。馬克司底一家，不是沒有錢，物質的享受是毫玩問題的，問題是精神上大家都感覺苦悶，孤獨，互相猜忌，勾心鬥角，一家五個人五條心。在麗弗尼生日這天，大家明皺暗鬥，矛盾達於極點，而最後這個家是以暴易暴——自馬克司手裏移轉到彭手裏。作者抓住了這一個家庭鬥爭的高潮，以輕松而緊湊的筆法，色出了這幅極精彩的「家」底橫斷面。裏面有不少幽默笑料，有不少舌劍唇槍的對白，有不少發人猛省的警句，這是一個有深長意義的電影劇本。</p>
<p>假如容許我們吹毛求疵的話，在這個電影劇本裏沒有一個新生的第二代，沒有出現一個敢哭，敢笑，敢怒，敢罵，敢打的家庭叛徒，僅僅是一個有良心的家庭主婦——而且最後一走了事，未免太軟弱了一點。</p>
<p>不是因爲弗德立馬區是金項獎明星而我們胡亂吹捧，的確，在充滿了大腿色情的好萊塢西片中，這一部意味深長的「家」是很不錯的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Peace Talks Officially Begin Today: Discussing Eight Guiding Principles; Communists Agree to Issue Ceasefire Order <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Confirmed information: The official negotiations between the government and the Communist peace delegations are scheduled to commence on the 5th in Peiping. Furthermore, the Communists have agreed to halt military offensives during the peace talks. This order will be issued by the Communist military authorities, notifying frontline troops. These two points were brought back by Acting President Li’s personal envoy, Huang Chi-han, who returned to Nanjing from Peiping on the 3rd aboard a special China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. It is understood that after arriving in Peiping, the government peace delegation immediately engaged in informal contact with the Communist representatives to discuss the technical aspects of the peace negotiation process. This work has now been completed, and thus it has been decided to begin formal talks on the 5th to discuss the eight conditions proposed by Mao Tse-tung. The Communist Party's attitude towards the eight conditions remains unchanged in principle, but the scope has been considered for relaxation. The extent of this relaxation will be discussed and decided during the formal meetings. This is the most important development before the start of these peace talks, and it can also be seen as the key to the success or failure of future negotiations. Regarding the Communist Party's agreement to cease military offensives, due to the numerous technical and detailed aspects of a comprehensive ceasefire that require further study, a decision cannot be reached in the short term. Therefore, this matter must be reserved for discussion in the formal meetings. However, military offensives will obviously have an impact during the peace talks, so the government specifically requested this from the Communist Party to allow the peace talks to proceed in a harmonious atmosphere. Therefore, after three days of contact and informal meetings between the government representatives and the Communist side, the Communist Party has agreed. This cessation of military offensives marks the beginning of a de facto ceasefire, and the hope for comprehensive peace seems to have taken another step forward. Judging from the above news, the government peace delegation has already achieved significant success. During this period, in addition to close contact with the Communist peace representatives, they also met with Mao Tse-tung and other Communist leaders, and the situation was positive. After returning to Nanjing on the 3rd, Huang Chi-han immediately went to Acting President Li's official residence in Chuanhougang that evening to report. Huang also brought back many letters, with letters from government representatives and advisors addressed to their respective relevant individuals.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The procedures for the peace talks are roughly divided into three stages: (1) Preliminary exchange of opinions, (2) Formal talks, and (3) Political Consultative Conference. The preliminary exchange of opinions stage has now concluded, and the formal talks will begin on the 5th. This stage will discuss the principles of the eight conditions. If progress is smooth and a conclusion is reached, then the second stage can be declared complete, and the reorganization of a coalition government, etc., may be launched immediately. A new Political Consultative Conference can also be expected to be prepared and convened to resolve the technical issues related to the eight conditions, such as the abolition of the constitution and the reorganization of the military. Observers believe that the achievements that can be obtained in the first stage will be seen in the Communist Party's cessation of offensives, with a de facto ceasefire seemingly a smooth beginning. However, the second stage may immediately encounter difficulties, so the convening of a new Political Consultative Conference is likely to be very distant.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The government peace delegation has been in Peiping for four days. All contacts in the past three days have been general visits and informal exchanges of opinions. However, the Communist authorities attach great importance to the delegation. The Communist figures contacted by the delegation, in addition to the five peace representatives, Zhou Enlai, and other democratic figures, also included Mao Tse-tung, who has already met with them. It is reported that the government delegation has been listening to Communist broadcasts for several days, and the criticism of the government is still extremely sharp and insulting. They inquired about this with the Communist Party, and the response was that this was done by political workers and not an instruction from the authorities, indicating that the Communist Party is sincere in seeking peace and that this is unrelated.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] On the eve of the official start of the peace talks, Acting President Li, after listening to Huang Chi-han's report on Peiping, specifically invited key figures in Nanjing to gather at the official residence on the 4th to discuss relevant countermeasures. He also spoke with Zhang Zhizhong in Peiping twice by long-distance telephone to exchange opinions and instruct on the attitude to be taken. Those present at the meeting included He Yingqin, Wu Zhongxin, Weng Wenhao, Huang Chi-han, and Qiu Changwei.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Lei Chen Expresses Thoughts on Peace Talks: Urges National Vigilance; The Issue of the So-Called Coalition Government Cannot Be Ignored <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 4th] Lei Chen, former Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, made a statement before leaving Taiwan on the 3rd, saying: "Peace is what the people of the whole country are seeking, and we naturally hope that a reasonable and true peace will be realized. However, we must not ignore the issue of the so-called coalition government, but should be especially vigilant, because if the result of the peace talks is the realization of the so-called coalition government manipulated by the Chinese Communists, then the future of China will be unthinkable. This can be explained from two aspects: First, in terms of internal affairs, it will inevitably lead to an anti-freedom, anti-democracy, and anti-humanity future, achieving a situation of Communist violent dictatorship. Second, in terms of diplomacy, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet government is morally obliged to provide assistance to the National Government. In the future, if a coalition government is produced to inherit the legitimacy of the National Government, and the so-called coalition government is essentially controlled by the Chinese Communists, then the Soviet government can legitimately, under the guise of assistance, pull China into the Communist International Iron Curtain. The example of Czechoslovakia can serve as a warning. This is what we should pay special attention to regarding the future of the peace talks. If the result is like this, we must firmly oppose it." Lei continued to express his thoughts on the current peace talks, saying: "During the preparation process for these peace talks, the Chinese Communists' style is very different from the democratic spirit of the government during the Political Consultative Conference in 1946. First, at that time, the government side was not only very polite in receiving and negotiating with the Chinese Communist representatives, but also maintained a tolerant attitude in the conference hall despite the Chinese Communist representatives' unbridled insults, and even humiliations. Moreover, the newspapers in the government area also accepted the government's guidance to avoid publishing provocative texts. But this time, the Chinese Communist broadcasts are in the tone of the surrendered, referring to the government representatives as representatives of the reactionary government. Second, before the opening of the Political Consultative Conference at that time, the Chinese Communist representative Zhou Enlai insisted on not participating in the meeting without a ceasefire, and the government finally ordered a ceasefire at 8:00 a.m. on the day of the opening of the meeting (January 10), and the meeting began at 10:00 a.m. Now, the Chinese Communist troops are still actively attacking Anqing and other outposts north of the Yangtze River, as well as the situation around Xiangfan and Zhengyi, which are obvious examples. Third, when the Political Consultative Conference was held at that time, news was not blocked, reporters could participate in the audience, and report freely. Now, the peace talks in Peiping do not allow reporters to attend, and what is the essence of the "democracy" that the Chinese Communists have been promoting in recent years? We can also roughly get a powerful counter-evidence from this."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] At the banquet on the 4th to receive the National Representatives staying in Nanjing, Acting President Li explained his painstaking efforts to seek peace and the factors that will ensure the success of seeking peace. He emphasized the importance of taking the will of the people as one's own will and the urgency of the people's need for peace today.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Yan Xishan will stay in Nanjing for another three to several days before returning to Taiyuan due to Acting President Li's retention. Yan told reporters on the 4th that if the peace talks are successful, he will abide by the government's orders. If the peace talks are not successful, he is determined to resist to the death to defend Taiyuan. Regarding the reported statement by Fu Zuoyi, Yan judged, based on his understanding of Fu's character, that this move may be the result of the Chinese Communist Party's planned persuasion of Fu. Although he has no facts to prove it, he does not believe that the statement was written by the Chinese Communist Party and forced Fu to sign it. He believes that the statement may have come from Fu's secretary's pen. Yan believes that the Chinese Communist Party's approach is a propaganda offensive against the government to win more individual surrenders.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 4th] Ma Bufang, chairman of Qinghai Province, and Ma Hongkui, chairman of Ningxia Province, may arrive in Lanzhou on the evening of the 4th or the morning of the 5th. They will fly to Nanjing together with Guo Jiqiao, chairman of Gansu Province, on the 5th. It is reported that the three men were summoned by Acting President Li.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] American reporter Lademan recently traveled to Chongqing, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Xining and other places, and visited Ma Bufang, chairman of Qinghai Province, to discuss current affairs. It is said: At that time, General Ma Bufang firmly stated that he was unwilling to accept the constraints of the future Kuomintang-Communist peace agreement. Qinghai now has 100,000 elite troops, most of whom are Muslims, and will deal with the Chinese Communist Party to the end and will never compromise. General Ma expressed deep dissatisfaction with the past central government for failing to provide Qinghai with sufficient U.S. aid military supplies, and criticized President Chiang especially. It is said that Qing Province received only 50 tons of U.S. aid military supplies in total, of which 20 tons were weapons and 30 tons were ammunition, which were transported to Qing Province by Chennault's Air Transport Group. The amount of U.S. aid military supplies received by Ma Hongkui in Ningxia was also similar, and he paid US$160,000 for air transportation. Regarding the equipment of the Qinghai army, Ma Bufang admitted that there was a lack of artillery units, and the types of light weapons were very diverse, making supply difficult, and there were no ammunition factories in the entire Northwest.</p>
<h3 id="e17">During the Meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Financial and Economic Committee, Liu Gongyun Reports on Finance: The Government Holds Huge Amounts of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange; There Is No Risk of Economic Collapse Within a Year <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] When Finance Minister Liu Gongyun attended the Legislative Yuan's Financial and Economic Committee on the morning of the 4th to report on finance, he admitted that the current financial situation is indeed facing difficulties, and the deterioration of the economy is deepening and is very worrying. However, the government is currently working hard in three areas: (1) increasing revenue (increasing income), (2) reducing expenditure (reducing expenditure), and (3) making up for the shortfall (borrowing foreign debt). If one of these three items can be resolved, a fundamental reform can be considered. At present, due to various difficulties, it is actually difficult to fundamentally solve these three problems. We can only start by maintaining the status quo and preventing the economy from continuing to deteriorate. When reporting, Liu based his report on the financial and financial sections of the Executive Yuan's policy guidelines, explaining them item by item, and especially focusing on the three issues of increasing income, reducing expenditure, and making up for the shortfall. Regarding the part about increasing income, Liu pointed out that in the past, merchants often postponed the payment of taxes, which affected tax revenue and expenditure by 4%. Therefore, it was decided to change the collection of tariffs to customs dollars and create tax dollars so that tax revenue would not be affected by price fluctuations and currency depreciation. Currently, efforts are being made to rectify tax revenue. Regarding the part about reducing expenditure, Liu pointed out that before the fundamental situation changes, the general advocacy of layoffs, downsizing, and military cuts must wait until three to five months later to have an effect. At the time of layoffs and downsizing, only expenditures will increase. For example, cutting 200,000 troops will require an additional 100 billion yuan in severance pay. As for making up for the shortfall, only borrowing, borrowing from the United States, and silver matters are still under negotiation. Although there is hope, there is no definite certainty. Levying property tax is also a way to make up for the shortfall, but it is impossible to predict the future effect. Liu then discussed the issuance of gold yuan certificates, saying: As of the end of March, the number of certificates issued was 200 billion yuan, which is three times more than in February. If the situation continues to deteriorate in April and maintains the situation of increasing three times in March, then the issuance must increase by 600 billion yuan. The expenditure for April is estimated to reach 800 billion yuan, which must be made up for in other ways. It is hoped that 400 billion yuan can be recovered by selling gold, silver, and foreign exchange, so that the economic situation will not deteriorate further. During the Kong-Song era, the policy of selling at low prices was adopted in an attempt to stabilize the entire financial system, but it ultimately failed. The purpose of the current selling policy is to recover gold yuan, so the policy of high prices has been adopted. At this point, Liu solemnly declared that the total value of the gold, silver, and foreign exchange held by the government still reaches more than US$200 million. If the issuance in March was 200 billion yuan, only US$10 million is needed to recover all the gold yuan certificates. In the future, if US$15 million is sold every month, the government's gold, silver, and foreign exchange holdings can still support it for a year. Therefore, there is no risk of economic collapse within a year. As for the shortage of banknotes, the situation is indeed very serious in some areas, but it is believed that it can be resolved after a week. After Liu's report, Legislative Committee members Li Shijun, Wang Lihang, and others raised questions one after another. The comprehensive opinions were: (1) The policy of selling at high prices stimulates prices and is a "doing business" method, which should be corrected; (2) Tariffs and other tax revenues are calculated in customs dollars and tax dollars, indicating that the government itself does not trust gold yuan; (3) Those who have money should contribute money and use the assets of wealthy families; (4) How much gold, silver, and foreign exchange does the government hold from the people? How will it be used? Wang Lihang strongly stated that all the speculative and opportunistic behavior in Shanghai is mostly led by national agencies, and should be thoroughly rectified. Until about 12:00 noon, Liu, in addition to giving oral answers, also stated that he would answer the Legislative Committee's questions in detail in writing.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] He Jizhou, a Supervisory Committee member who went to Guangzhou to investigate the case of Liu Weizhi's corruption and embezzlement, returned to Nanjing a few days ago. After returning to Nanjing, he went to Shanghai for investigation and has now returned to Nanjing from Shanghai. According to the investigation results of Committee Member He in Guangzhou, in addition to the unauthorized withdrawal of public funds in Shanghai when Liu Weizhi was Minister of Industry and Commerce, which was investigated by Yu Peihou and others, Liu also borrowed two sums of public funds in Guangzhou, one being 10 million yuan in emergency expenses for civil servants received from the Ministry of Finance, which was not used up, and the other being 10 million yuan borrowed from the China Textile Corporation. This 10 million yuan was sealed for ten days and then unsealed again. Liu is suspected of serious exploitation. After Committee Member He investigated, he obtained conclusive evidence. After Committee Member Yu Peihou and others who went to Shanghai for investigation return to Nanjing, He will discuss whether to file an impeachment based on the investigation data, which may be filed within two or three days.</p>

<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 4th] The Anqing battle saw no changes on the 4th. According to military estimates, since the start of the battle thirteen days ago, the Communist forces have suffered over 20,000 casualties. The National Army, with continuous reinforcements from Yu Zhaolong's troops and several naval vessels, has further solidified its positions.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong is very optimistic about the Anqing battle. He stated that with the close cooperation of the National Army's land, sea, and air forces, the Communist offensive, though fierce, has had absolutely no practical effect.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Military News: The fighting on the outskirts of Anqing was relatively quiet on the 2nd due to overcast weather. On the night of the 2nd, the Communist forces took advantage of the darkness to launch a fierce attack on the outer positions. The fighting was extremely intense. The National Army, with the joint efforts of the land and sea forces, fought back bravely, engaging in a fierce battle throughout the night, killing and wounding over 10,000 Communist soldiers, creating an unprecedented victory in the defense of Anqing. On the 3rd, the Communist forces actively mobilized and deployed reinforcements, increasing their forces on the outskirts of Anqing to 50,000 by evening. They launched another fierce attack on the National Army's positions. The defending troops, under the cover of naval artillery fire, repelled the attacking Communist forces by midnight. On the morning of the 4th, the battle once again became quiet. The National Army is currently still securing its original positions on Lion Mountain, Wulidun, Qipan Mountain, and the Agricultural School on the outskirts of Anqing.</p>
<p>[Our Huayuan Dispatch, 4th] Military News: The Communist forces on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway are retreating southward step by step. Part of Lin Biao's 40th Army has reached Xinyang, but no main Communist forces have been found south of Jigong Mountain. The Communist forces west of Xiaogan on the west side of the railway continued to increase yesterday. The National Army has amassed enough forces on the east, west, and north sides of Xiaogan to strongly fortify the outer positions of Central China's heartland, and public morale is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 4th] The focus of the battle on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway has shifted to the area south of Guangshui to Huayuan on both sides. The front line appeared somewhat quiet today, as if another major battle is brewing. Trains north of Hankou only run to the area north of Xiaogan.</p>
<p>[Our Xiaogan Dispatch, 4th] The National Army now has new deployments on the front line from Jigong Mountain to Huayuan, as well as on both sides of the railway. Some powerful mobile units are stationed in the Guangshui and Huayuan areas. Passenger trains on the Pinghan Railway will resume service between Hankou and Xiaogan starting from the 5th.</p>

<h3 id="e21">How to Avoid the Reefs of Peace Talks? <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Since the government's peace talk representatives flew from Nanjing to Beiping on April 1st, it is reported that they have not yet touched on specific issues. For the first three days, representatives only talked individually with the Communist representatives, supposedly to foster goodwill and avoid things becoming stiff from the outset. It is likely that from today onwards, they may gradually start discussing the topics. It is also heard that the two sides plan to first divide into four small groups – diplomatic, military, political, and economic – to conduct separate consultations. Only after the small groups have made some progress will they formally begin negotiations. Regarding the two proposals made by the government representatives to the Communists: (1) the National and Communist armies should immediately cease fire in place, and (2) a new Political Consultative Conference should be convened first to discuss army reorganization and constitutional amendments, the Communist side, although its chief representative indicated that they could consider them, has not yet responded. According to the latest news last night, the two sides' representatives have decided to formally begin negotiations today. At the same time, the Communists have agreed to cease military offensives during the peace talks, but this remains to be confirmed after the ceasefire order is issued. However, at the same time, the Communist radio has been broadcasting for days, using the Nanjing student-military conflict incident to create irrelevant arguments, denouncing the government led by Acting President Li and Premier He as having no sincerity for peace, and stating that the Communist army "is determined to liberate all of China."</p>
<p>Peace is what everyone hopes for. However, looking at the situation in recent days, with the Communist army pressing closer step by step in the suburbs of Anqing and the southern section of the Pinghan Railway without any relaxation, it is clear that although peace talks have begun, they still lack a peaceful atmosphere. To ensure that the peace talks do not hit any reefs, we, standing from the perspective of the people, must frankly point out several unacceptable facts to draw the attention of both the National and Communist parties, and especially to awaken the vigilance of all compatriots.</p>
<p>First, for peace talks to succeed, they must be able to publicly share the progress and content of the daily talks. Peace talks are a major event related to the life and death of the 400 million people of the country, not a "child's play" for the National and Communist parties. There is no reason why they should be kept secret. Moreover, since both sides of the peace talks believe they are justified, they might as well each state their proposed conditions, methods, and reasons to convince the other party, and let the people listen. To put it crudely, peace talks should not be like what Shanghai people call "having an affair," which needs to be done secretly. Why is it that after the government representatives went north, they listened to the Communist Party's control and arrangements and were unwilling to disclose any information? And why are news reporters from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places not allowed to report the news? Is it possible that what they are talking about is not something that can be seen in broad daylight? It must be known that if there are reefs in peace talks, they must arise from "secrecy." If they become visible reefs, they can be avoided and safety can be guaranteed. The first step has already been taken incorrectly, and we are deeply worried about the future of the peace talks.</p>
<p>Second, for peace talks to succeed, benevolent people's representatives must be allowed to participate in addition to the representatives of the National and Communist parties. Only then can mediation and facilitation achieve considerable results. However, the government representatives are not seeking this, but only know how to create opportunities for the Communist Party. They do not value the opinions of people's organizations in various places, let alone invite people's representatives to participate in the discussions. If there are disputes, it will inevitably lead to everyone arguing their own point of view without any room for maneuver.</p>
<p>Third, for peace talks to succeed, it is natural and righteous to immediately cease all military actions. Not only should there be no more battles on the front line, but all troops on both sides should remain in their original defenses, awaiting reorganization. During the previous Political Consultative Conference, the National Government ordered a ceasefire four times within a year, and each time it was sabotaged by the Communist Party. How can we expect them to agree to a ceasefire today? In the suburbs of Anqing and along the Yangtze River, the Communist army has been attacking for nearly ten days, determined to capture Anqing. At the same time, they are launching a two-pronged attack on the rear and west of Wuhan. Although the government troops are retreating, the Communist army is advancing relentlessly, making gains inch by inch. The Communist army must have the courage of Fu Jian "throwing his whip to stop the flow," attempting to cross the Yangtze River in one fell swoop. The Communist broadcast wants the government's willingness to handle "war criminals" as a touchstone for genuine sincerity for peace.</p>
<p>Fourth, for peace talks to succeed, avoid bringing up irrelevant topics that take the discussion further and further away from the main point. For example, the Atlantic Treaty was signed in Washington yesterday by the foreign ministers of twelve countries, which has nothing to do with China. China is not a country along the Atlantic coast, and there is no need to bring this issue into the scope of the peace talks. However, according to reports, the Communist Party is preparing to add a condition on foreign policy to the peace talks, which is to require the future coalition government to be completely inclined towards the Soviet Union and unanimously oppose the United States and Western European countries. It is difficult to say whether this is the speculation of foreign reporters, but looking at the broadcasts of the Communist radio, the joint statement issued by Mao Zedong, Li Jishen, and others, unanimously opposing the Atlantic Treaty, and openly declaring that they "will unite the people of the whole country, join hands with China's ally, the Soviet Union, and resolutely fight against the instigators of aggressive war to defeat the aggressors," one cannot help but believe that the Communist Party intends to drag China to be the tail of the Soviet Union, running around blindly, and even plunging into the vortex of international war as a form of self-indulgence. If the Communist Party representatives intend to raise this issue in the peace talks, the government representatives, deeply aware of the awesomeness of public opinion, will not dare to agree rashly, and peace may be stranded at this point.</p>

<p>[Report] Washington, 4th: The US Senate unanimously passed an amended foreign aid bill, prohibiting US relief supplies from being transported to areas controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. This resolution was passed after Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally announced that the committee did not oppose the amendment. It is unprecedented for the foreign aid bill to clearly stipulate restrictions against the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] Although the 1948 US Aid to China Act expired on the 3rd, the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) will continue to work hard to promote the aid to China plan, making full use of the remaining $54 million under the Aid to China Act. Future plans will roughly focus on rural reconstruction in the non-Communist areas of China. Moyer, an American member of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, is currently here drafting the budget for the next period (April 1949 to February 1950). The commission is expected to receive $10 million to $15 million. According to Moyer, the committee has only just begun and will make great strides in the future. The committee's work focuses on land reform, irrigation, seed improvement, animal disease prevention, sanitation, family improvement, and public education. The work areas are in Taiwan, Guangxi, Fujian, and Sichuan. In the past year, the committee's expenses have mostly been borne by the Chinese side. In the future, it is planned to rely on the United States. The purpose of land reform is to transfer land from large landlords to individual landowners. Landlords and farmers can cooperate well on this. Once the land reform plan is completed, the living standards of farmers can be improved. In terms of irrigation, the commission has received various proposals from the Chinese side and will review them soon.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Gu Bonian, Special Representative of the ECA China Mission and Director of the Nanjing Office, announced on the 4th that as of April 2nd, Nanjing had received $3,579,307.50 in US aid. The most important part of this aid was the supply of rice for rationing in Nanjing, totaling 246,169.5 shi of Siamese rice, with a total value of $3,200,333.50, which has been distributed together with the rice borrowed by the Chinese government.</p>

<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 4th] Song Xilian's corps designation has been revoked and changed to the Office of the Military and Political Governor of the Xiang-E-Chuan-Qian Border Area, located in Changde, responsible for the defense of the border areas of the four provinces and with full authority to handle the Xiangxi issue. Chen Mingren's corps, which recently moved to Changde, will be transferred to Yi-Sha to take over Song's corps' defense area. It is heard that Song plans to reorganize the scattered civilian guns and armies in various counties of Xiangxi. Luo Wenjie, who has potential influence in Xiangxi, will reportedly join Song's staff to plan the resolution of the Xiangxi issue.</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 4th] Liu Jiashu, Chief of Staff of the Pacification Headquarters, went from Yuanjiang to Chenxi on the 3rd. Chen Yulin, commander of the newly recruited Second Suppression Column, greeted him 30 li outside the city. Chenxi has good order, shops are open as usual, and prices are low. Li Jingyi in Wugang has a clear attitude and is willing to comply with orders to stop activities. The Pacification Headquarters may grant him the designation of Suppression Column. As for Yin Liyan, he will be eliminated. Hongjiang and Anjiang are still safe due to effective defense.</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 4th] A person from Ningxiang reported that the local Communist forces led by Jiang Yaxun in the county have recently joined forces with Chen Zhongyi and others, numbering nearly 3,000 people with over 1,000 guns. They have sent Liu Meifu and others to be responsible for training military and political cadres, adopting the style of the "Liberation Army"</p>

<p>[Our Guiyang Dispatch, 4th] Luoping and Shizong in southeastern Yunnan, adjacent to Xingyi County in southwestern Guizhou, have recently been organized by Zhang Tianlu and Zhuang Yan from the Communist area in Luoping to form a people's government and have scoured to Xingyi, Xingren, and other counties. More than 6,000 bandits are entrenched in Huangni River at the junction of the two provinces. Two-thirds of the townships in Xingyi County have been lost, and the situation is serious. Geshang Town, 40 li away from the county seat, fell on the 1st, and people are panic-stricken. Fortunately, the bandit forces in Panxian and Puan have been suppressed, and the provincial security teams have gradually moved south to intercept and suppress them. Chen Mengsi's division of the National Army, which arrived in Guiyang last month, has also been ordered to reinforce. In Ceheng and Wangmo on the Guizhou-Guangxi border, Guangxi bandits frequently enter and exit. The commander of the Guizhou-Guangxi Joint Defense arrived in Baise from Liuzhou on March 22 to supervise the security teams to suppress the bandits on the border. The Guizhou provincial government has ordered all counties in the province to cooperate in the attack. In Tongren Yangtousi and Yuping Huangdaopu in eastern Guizhou, 600 to 700 bandits from Xiangxi sneaked in at the end of March. After being blocked by Commissioner Xia and the provincial security team, they have recently been driven out of the border.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Corruption Case of Qingdao Garrison Headquarters Personnel: More Shocking Discoveries; Senior Officials Involved in Drug Trafficking Case; Dismissed Chief of Staff Has Been Placed Under Surveillance <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 4th] As our newspaper continues to investigate the corruption case of Qingdao Garrison Headquarters personnel, more shocking discoveries have been made. According to sources, this case broke a branch of a large drug trafficking organization, and other senior officials are involved.</p>
<p>According to sources, the drug trafficking organization is the Yuanfeng Aquatic Products Store at No. 69 Jinxiang Road. The main culprits, Song Shaochu, Liu Pinsan, and Yu Xihou, have been arrested and detained. Song is the manager. Another deputy manager, surnamed Han, returned to Yuanfeng the day after Song and others were arrested, using a pre-prepared fake ID card to deceive the military and police and resisted arrest with force when he was detained. The ten sacks of gold yuan notes seized at the Xiaogang checkpoint were related to this store and were transported by wooden boat from Haixi to Qingdao. Manager Song was usually generous and had wide connections, colluding with unscrupulous officers and soldiers. Based on the clues found in the gold yuan notes, the Garrison Headquarters' Chief of Staff Huang Gonglu immediately issued an order to search the store that night. Military, police, and military police jointly surrounded No. 69 Jinxiang Road and searched the houses one by one.</p>
<p>"Don't Want Gold, Just Want Your Head"</p>
<p>Song and others knew that things were not good. They immediately opened the silver box, revealing gold, US dollars, and silver dollars, the amount of which was inestimable, with a total value of hundreds of taels. They said, "Don't worry, everyone, please take whatever you want." The search personnel, knowing that Song and others had a "gangster style" and were quite "stuck in a rut," further confirmed the truth. Song also listed the names of certain people who had dealings with them. He then took out 50 taels of gold as a bribe. The search personnel said it was too little. Song added another 50 taels. They said it was still too little. Song asked how much they wanted. They replied that this case was too big and they wanted his head. Song said that if that was the case, he could only go with them. He was then arrested, and a bill for trading opium with the East China Trade Bureau of the Communist area was found. The main destination was Shanghai.</p>
<p>Business Cards and Loans: Clues</p>
<p>Hundreds of business cards were also confiscated, mostly from local figures, requesting loans of tens of thousands to meet urgent needs. The dates were mostly at the end of the lunar year, providing clues. The exposure of the supervisory chief Zhang Tong and others' concealment of the number of gold yuan notes and embezzlement was also the result of Song's connections. They originally planned to get it back, but the attempt backfired, embarrassing many people. Yu Jingchen, the chief of the checkpoint, once fled but then surrendered. His confession of the embezzlement process was as long as fifty pages of ten-line paper, stating that he only received one tael of gold. As for how to distribute the concealed funds, it was all instructed by Chief of Staff Huang Gonglu. Zhang Tong's gold, US dollars, and other evidence were confiscated from him during the interrogation. Chief of Staff Huang Gonglu was nominally transferred to the Suiyuan District as a senior staff officer, but he has actually been placed under surveillance.</p>
<p>Smuggling Incidents Emerge One After Another</p>
<p>Also, smuggling incidents between Qingdao and the Communist areas seem to be emerging one after another. Just as one wave subsides, another rises. One night, the navy intercepted a steamship in Jiaozhou Bay, fully loaded with telecommunications equipment. They checked it. It was claimed that the Suiyuan District Economic Office had issued a visa to transport goods to Haixi to exchange with the Communist area. The people and ship have been detained. The evidence of the goods leaving the country does not seem to be forged, but the Economic Office denies issuing the visa. The case is under development.</p>

<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 4th] With the introduction of the 10,000-yuan note, the amount of chips in the market has increased sharply, and prices have risen even more sharply: white rice 149,700 yuan, white rice 153,200 yuan, mutton rice 148,200 yuan, wheat 131,000 yuan, flour 54,800 yuan, soybean oil 890,000 yuan, cotton yarn 4.33 million yuan.

<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 4th] The Lanzhou Central Bank received 500 million yuan in thousand-yuan notes from Shanghai on the 3rd, which was the largest transfer ever.

<h3 id="e43">Signing of the Atlantic Treaty Completed: Truman Delivers a Speech Reaffirming That the Treaty Aims to Defend Against Aggression; Willing to Abide by the Principles of the United Nations Charter <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Washington, 4th Broadcast: President Truman, in his speech at the signing ceremony of the North Atlantic Treaty, stated that it was his good fortune to welcome the foreign ministers of various countries to jointly establish the unity of the North Atlantic nations on this historic occasion. The purpose of today's meeting is to enable this international agreement to fulfill its task of safeguarding the security and prosperity of the signatory countries. What we have signed is a "neighborly treaty." The text of this treaty is very clear. The signatory countries are willing to abide by the peaceful principles of the United Nations, to live in friendship with all countries, and to provide economic assistance to each other. In the event that the territory or independence of any country is threatened, they will consult on how to respond and provide assistance to the victim of aggression. This treaty is a simple document, but if it had existed in 1914 and 1939 and had the support of the countries gathered here today, I believe it would have prevented the two world wars of those years. Most of us participated in the founding of the United Nations, and every member state has an obligation to maintain international peace and security and to seek peaceful solutions to international disputes. We reaffirm these guarantees and obligations here today. We rededicate ourselves to these obligations and propose that this North Atlantic Treaty be one way to fulfill these obligations. We are adopting this treaty in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter to address international issues. We use the right of collective or individual self-defense to resist armed attacks and maintain international peace and security.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The United States, Britain, France, and nine non-Communist countries today signed the historic North Atlantic Security Treaty, which is the final guarantee of joint defense against any aggressor and a clear warning to Communist Soviet Union. Once the treaty is ratified, the US border defense will move to the center of Europe for at least twenty years. The signing ceremony was held at 3:00 PM standard time on the 4th (4:00 AM on the 5th Shanghai time) in the Government Auditorium on Constitution Avenue, not far from the White House. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak will be the first to sign the treaty, followed by the foreign ministers of the other eleven countries. US Secretary of State Acheson, as the host, will first deliver a five-minute introductory speech. After the foreign ministers of each country deliver short speeches, President Truman will deliver a speech as a guest to complete the ceremony. No fewer than 1,300 cabinet members, officials, diplomatic envoys, members of Congress, and journalists from various countries were invited to attend.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The signing of the North Atlantic Treaty today may trigger new dangers in the East-West Cold War. When the UN General Assembly meets in New York tomorrow, the Soviet Union will immediately have a great opportunity to openly attack the treaty. It is expected that Soviet Chief Representative Gromyko will again display his eloquence. Diplomats speculate that the Soviet Union may adjust its policies or take actions in the future to overthrow the Atlantic Treaty or make it fail. The Soviet Union may take some practical actions to test the effectiveness of the new treaty. Its provocations will be indirect, such as actions in Finland and the Middle East. Responsible officials do not believe that the Soviet Union will risk war with the West at this time, but some people believe that if the Soviet Union intends to wage war or believes that it has the power to launch a war, it will definitely strike first before the new Atlantic defense organization is fully established. Well-informed sources believe that the Soviet Union will use war intimidation to divide the text alignment.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] Foreign Minister Bevin today discussed the issue of Italian colonies with Italian Foreign Minister Sforza here. Related parties believe that the disposal of Italian Tripoli is still the crux of the Italian colonial issue.

In addition to the four countries of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, those who feel a direct interest in the disposal of Italian colonies include Egypt, Abyssinia, Italy, South Africa, and various Arab countries. Acheson recently held talks with the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Italy, and almost focused on finding a formula for solving the issue of Tripoli. It is said that whether the Italian colonies are governed by one country or entrusted to several countries under the United Nations, it is bound to be done through international cooperation to improve the economic and social standards of the local natives.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tehran, 3rd Dispatch] Relations between Iran and the Soviet Union are becoming increasingly tense, and there is a danger of imminent conflict. According to a treaty signed between the two countries more than twenty years ago, if Iran becomes a base for military action against the Soviet Union, the Soviet army has the right to enter Iranian territory. Iran's position is on the left flank of Turkey. Once lost, Truman's policy of passive observation in Turkey and Greece will immediately collapse. What is even more important is that the democratic countries' huge oil concession rights in Iran and Arabia will also be cut off. In short, the entire Middle East will fall into the hands of the Soviet Union like an overripe pomegranate. The Iranian army is sufficient to maintain domestic security, but it cannot withstand fully modernized military organizations for long.</p>

The price base number for the barber industry has been determined to be divided into five grades and ten levels, and it was implemented on the 25th of last month, with good results. A solution has not yet been found for the price of bathhouses and is currently being approved. There are many reasons for the fluctuating rice prices in this city. The government is working from three aspects: "releasing," "rationing," and "guiding." On the one hand, it is seeking to strengthen the rice rationing system and is working hard to guide the source of food. It is believed that when rice rationing begins tomorrow, rice prices may tend to stabilize. (3) In terms of labor administration: There were very few labor-capital disputes before March 15. In the second half of March, due to the cash panic, there were more than 30 dispute cases. Fortunately, both labor and management were able to overcome difficulties together and accept government mediation. After the Labor Hospital opened its clinic, the content still needs to be enriched. A factory employee welfare association has been established to actively promote it. (4) In terms of relief and culture: The winter relief work has ended. Recently, in order to handle the reception of refugee students from North China and Tianjin, we are cooperating with the Education Bureau. The first batch of 500 refugees have been sent to Jiangxi for resettlement, and the second batch of about 1,000 people will be sent soon. A total of 27 kinds of illegal publications have been banned in this city, 3 have been suspended, 3 have been warned, and more than 100 registration certificates have been revoked for overdue non-publication. Other activities such as enriching public fund, improving business, and restoring small loans are being actively carried out separately. After Cao's report, Secretary-General Chen Liang gave an impromptu speech, stating briefly: Mayor Wu needs to recuperate in another place for a short period of time due to illness, and the Executive Yuan has approved a one-month leave of absence. During Wu's leave of absence, all official duties will be temporarily shared by me in accordance with the mayor's instructions. At this extraordinary time, I hope that all supervisors will be particularly cautious and work harder to avoid delays. The meeting adjourned at 10 o'clock.</p>

Neighbors Huang Runsheng and Wang Lisheng testified that Chen often beat Cai.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau convened various industrial trade associations in this city yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of raw materials. Representatives from more than forty units, including the Industrial Association, Ouyang Lun, Chen Daosheng, Hong Nianzu, Guo Yongxi, and Chen Fenghao, attended. Wang Jiashu, Director of the First Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, presided over the meeting. First, the representatives reported on the raw material situation of their respective industries, providing detailed reports on the amount of demand, the amount of raw materials currently available, and whether there were any difficulties in sourcing them. According to them, due to the shrinking market, the people's weak purchasing power, and poor sales, production has also decreased, so there is no significant shortage of raw materials. However, the general feeling of difficulty is that because the interest rate on borrowing is too high, factories are unwilling to borrow money to purchase raw materials. Usually, they sell a portion of their products to purchase raw materials. Therefore, most of the current industrial raw materials are in the hands of vendors or importers. They hope that low-interest industrial loans can be realized as soon as possible to facilitate the storage and purchase of raw materials. In order to further understand the situation of each industry, the Social Affairs Bureau decided to create a survey form, including the quantity and type of raw materials. The various industries will be divided into: (1) daily necessities, (2) electrical machinery, (3) chemical industry, and (4) textile industry, and they will be required to fill out the forms separately, collect the statistics, and then determine the method. It is said that the principle is that each factory must store at least six months' worth of raw materials to facilitate production.</p>

(2) It should be stated that the government does not aim to benefit financially from trade between the North and South except for collecting taxes in accordance with regulations. The materials exchanged from the North should be distributed and used by the industrial and commercial sectors themselves, and state-owned agencies should never handle them. It is reported that the Municipal Industrial Association will hold a meeting to discuss the matter and then forward it to the government for adoption.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Ancient Tomb in Changzhou Ready for Excavation <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Li Tianxing</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Wugang, 3rd] The discovery of an ancient tomb in Yunjiadun, Qinglong Bridge, in the southern suburbs of Changzhou, has spread far and wide with the spring breeze. However, due to the frequent winds and rains in spring, which have soaked the fields, and the tense military situation in the area, with conscription of soldiers and grain creating considerable stress, the excavation work has been delayed. Now, the second excavation meeting has decided to invite experts from Shanghai and Nanjing, such as Jiang Dayi, Yang Kuanzheng, and Mr. Zeng Zhaoyu from the Nanjing Central Museum Research Institute, on the 9th of this month for a definitive excavation meeting. Thirty dan of rice will be allocated as the initial excavation cost, assuming there are no other complications. The official excavation can begin as early as the 10th!</p>
<p>For the past two weeks, local dignitaries, visiting experts, and ordinary villagers have been discussing this mysterious ancient tomb, their comments as varied as the "noisy stage gongs" before the curtain rises on a play, both moving and endearing. To search, to collect, to piece it together, to record it word by word, to glean from ancient culture – this is the motivation for me to write this article.</p>
<p>The Outline of Qinglong Bridge</p>
<p>Leaving the Small South Gate and following the current Wuyi Road for about a little over a li, you arrive at the countryside of Qinglong Bridge! In the past, this area was commonly known as Chashan Road, with three tea pavilions called First, Second, and Third Tea Pavilion. "Ten li of long pavilions, the setting sun over the ancient road." Gazing from the slopes, the desolate atmosphere that one would expect in the countryside is pervasive. Mounds of desolate tombs, green grass and wheat – it is easy to recall the past of the ancient city and naturally "arouse ancient feelings"! Qinglong Bridge no longer has a bridge! The surrounding area is crisscrossed by fields, with flat hills and shallow mounds scattered around. Yunjiadun is a relatively prominent and large tomb mound nearby. Less than a hundred paces west of the mound is a small village called Yunjia Village. Northwest of the mound is the Qinglong Bridge Elementary School, which was originally the local land temple. Several gilded Buddha statues are still preserved. This place is not entirely desolate, but it carries a hint of desolation.</p>
<p>The discovery of the ancient tomb was accidental. According to the residents of Yunjia Village, at the end of last year, the 52nd Army was stationed in Changzhou and took a fancy to this high tomb. They dug deep trenches and built fortifications on it. When they dug more than a zhang deep, they discovered a large number of bricks and stones, and the work stopped. This New Year, nearby villagers discovered many bricks and took them for their own use, digging up more and more. The villagers were naive, only knowing that the bricks could be used to repair the ground or walls, and they didn't care about "ancient." But unintentionally, the first chamber of the ancient tomb was ruthlessly dug out by them, and they didn't know what was going on. At the time, it was said that ancient coins and bronze swords were found, but everything was covered in mud, moldy, and rotten, so everyone carelessly discarded them!</p>
<p>On March 12, the construction of the fortifications resumed. During the excavation, a second archway was suddenly discovered, and a glimpse of a tomb chamber inside was seen. This is when the name "ancient tomb" began to spread. On the 15th, reporters from local newspapers rushed to visit, and the entire city flocked to watch. The county government and the garrison headquarters officially began to protect the site and plan the excavation.</p>
<p>Strange Patterns on the Ancient Tomb Bricks</p>
<p>The currently discovered ancient tomb is generally said to be the second chamber of the tomb. The first chamber was unintentionally dug out by the villagers for bricks. The entrance to the second chamber is arched, facing south. It is about three chi wide and over four chi high. Inside is a room about five or six chi square. The room is extremely damp, and the ground is filled with broken mud. There are no bottom bricks. The top is entirely made of bricks laid sideways, with clear, elegant, and profound patterns. On the front wall is an entrance, and on the east wall is also an entrance, slightly lower than the front one. Both entrances are tightly packed with bricks laid sideways and have not yet been excavated.</p>
<p>Regarding the tomb bricks, I have seen three types of patterns. The bricks are all rectangular, with equal width, thickness, and height (see our newspaper on the 31st). All the tomb bricks have the distinct impression of being specially made or custom-made. The patterns are largely the same, featuring layered banana leaf patterns and overlapping herringbone patterns. See the attached diagram. The text on the ancient coin pattern has not yet been definitively determined. According to Professor Jiang Dayi of Tongji University, it may be "Da Quan Wu Bai" (Great Coin Five Hundred) or "Da Quan Wu Qian" (Great Coin Five Thousand). However, "Quan" may be an abbreviated form of "Quan" (spring). "Da Quan Wu Bai" and "Da Quan Wu Qian" were both currencies minted by Sun Quan, Emperor Da of the Three Kingdoms Wu, in the fifth year of the Jiahe reign. If this is the case, then this tomb must be after Sun Quan. According to Wang Shouxiang's research, the character "Mu" (eye) has an extra horizontal stroke, which is the ancient character "Liang" (good). "Liang Quan" also has the meaning of Tong Bao (circulating treasure). The claw shape is suspected to be half of the character "Feng" (phoenix). Therefore, if it records weight, it would be "Wu Zhu Liang Quan" (Five Zhu Good Coin), and if it records the reign year, it would be "Wu Feng Liang Quan" (Five Phoenix Good Coin), which also makes sense. Chen Fengyuan also stated that the inscription on the brick pattern says, "Each of the two circles contains four characters, but only three characters are clear. One is 'Wu' (five), one is 'Quan' (coin), and one is 'Mu' (eye) with an extra horizontal stroke. According to this, it is the ancient character 'Liang' (good) and cannot be interpreted as 'Bai' (hundred). The ancient form of the character 'Bai' (hundred) consists of 'Yi' (one) and 'Zi' (self), unlike the ancient form of 'Liang' (good), which has three horizontal strokes added to a long frame, as seen in inscriptions on metal and stone. In Zhuangzi's Lie Yukou, it says, '　Hu looked at the ancestral hall and saw its Liang, making it the fruit of autumn cypress,' and the commentary explains, 'Liang means good person, or it can be written as Yin, pronounced Lang, meaning mound.' If the blurred character is 'Da' (great), 'Da' (great) is also the ancient character for 'Ren' (person). Therefore, combining these four characters should be 'Wu Ren Quan Liang' (Five Persons Whole Good), meaning 'Five People Whole Family' or 'Whole Family Five People'." There are currently several studies on the textual research.</p>
<p>Yang Yourun's Views</p>
<p>A local gentleman named Yang Yourun, who works in the History, Language, and Archaeology Group of the Central Research Institute, has expressed nine opinions. (1) The overlapping herringbone shape on the edge of the brick is unique to Han tombs. (2) It has been discovered in the eastern nine provinces and Gansu. This proves that this pattern was a Han Dynasty fashion and was widely spread. (3) There are many ancient coin patterns on Han tomb bricks, but the ones discovered at Qinglong Bridge have never been seen before. (4) The characters on the bricks have never been seen before, so it is impossible to accurately determine the era. (5) The use of coin patterns on Han tomb bricks was a fashion at the time and does not necessarily mean it belonged to an emperor or general. (6) The ancient coin characters on the bricks do not necessarily match the era of the deceased. It is also not necessarily the style of currency used at the time. (7) From a general observation, the ancient tomb outside the South Gate should be a Han tomb, or not far from the Han Dynasty. (8) This tomb may have already been robbed. (9) A robbed tomb still has excavation value. The ancient tomb area outside the South Gate is extremely wide and does not seem to be a burial site for ordinary people. In addition, Cao Boru, based on historical and customary evidence, believes that the tomb may be the tomb of Yang Yun. Lu Chunyuan said that since this mound is called Yunjiadun, it should be related to the Yun family. The inscription on the Huangshan Temple Stele says, "Our Yun family's first generation, Lord Zhen Dao, Prime Minister of Liang in the Han Dynasty, came from Anding to live in Piling." This means that the Yun family had moved to Changzhou since the Han Dynasty. The Yun family has its own lineage and should not be confused with "Yang Yun." The tomb of Yang Yun is probably not credible.</p>
<p>Signs of Ancient Mausoleums</p>
<p>According to Wang Shouxiang's tomb research: The Wujin County Gazetteer and the Changzhou Prefecture Gazetteer both record the locations of ancient mausoleums. The Wushi Gazetteer says that Emperor Gao of Qi's Tai'an Mausoleum is in Tongjiang Township, Emperor Wu's Jing'an Mausoleum, Emperor Ming's Yu'an Mausoleum, and Emperor Jian of Liang Wu's father and daughter are all recorded in the township, but their exact locations are unknown. The Changzhou Prefecture Gazetteer states that Qi's Tai'an Mausoleum is on Pengshan in Tongjiang Township, Jing'an Mausoleum is where Qi Emperor Wu was buried, and Xing'an Mausoleum is where Qi Emperor Ming and Empress Jing Liu were buried. The Xingdi Gazetteer says that Tai'an, Jing'an, and Xing'an three mausoleums are in the northeast of the former Lanling, Jinniu Mountain. All the above-mentioned mausoleums, this place (referring to the southern suburbs) may be the sleeping mausoleum of Emperor Gao of Southern Qi. Emperor Gao's name was Xiao Daocheng, a native of Nanlanling (Wujin was formerly known as Nanlanling). He ascended the throne in the fourth year of Jianyuan of the Southern History and was buried in Tai'an Mausoleum in Wujin in April. The Prefecture Gazetteer records that the three mausoleums of Tai'an, Jing'an, and Xing'an are all in the northeast of the former Lanling. It is said that the ancient Lanling was located in the southern suburbs of today's city, so the southern suburbs of today's city may be the northeast of the former Lanling city. The name Qinglong Bridge may also be named because of the Xiao Mausoleum. The above are all preliminary investigations. All the abstracts are compiled and reported, which can be used as reference materials for future days.</p>

Inside the coffin was a decayed and terrifying male corpse, with small insects wriggling around it. The corpse wore a melon-skin cap, a blue-gray gabardine robe, and black cloth shoes. There were no contraband items. After determining the ownership of the corpse, the coffin was taken back. The eight suspects, boatman Weng Qiliang, Gu Renjin, Xia Meifang, and Weng Zhao's male and female family members, were released on bail.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Changzhou Prison Break Case; Fugitive Zhan Fang Apprehended; Thousand-Word Confession <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Wujin, 2nd] The unprecedented prison break occurred in this county on the evening of February 25th. After a long investigation by the criminal police team, it was learned that one of the fugitives, Jin Fang, was hiding in the Jiaxing Traffic Police Force, acting as a police officer. At the beginning of this month, Zhuang, the captain of the criminal police team, led officers to arrest him and brought him back to Changzhou on the afternoon of the 2nd. The prisoner is quite literate and drafted a confession of a thousand words, detailing the inside story of the prison break. It briefly stated that the incident was initiated by Huang Ming, the district chief of the Communist Party, and two others, who colluded with Director Guo and Director Wu in advance. When the release was opened, Director Guo smiled and personally called Chen Bingchang's name (one of the escaped prisoners) at Gate No. 7, then opened the door to let him escape. Jin Fang followed him out and saw Director Wu standing next to the main gate, with the warden also present. After Jin escaped, he tried to find connections and rejoined the old unit, while the others' whereabouts were unknown. Finally, he stated that he was originally from Guangdong and had been in the military since he was young, fighting on the battlefield for a long time and participating in the "January 28th" and "August 13th" battles. He believed that he was loyal to the party and the country and would never associate with the Communist Party. He escaped from prison this time due to temporary confusion and originally hoped to rehabilitate himself, so he returned to the old organization to atone for his previous mistakes. If he is not considered useless, he can be transferred to military service, and he will do his best until his death.</p>

<p>Wang Huimin asks: A man, A, is currently 20 years old. A woman, B, is currently 15 years old. In the summer of 1945, B's mother passed away, and her family did not take responsibility for her upbringing. Through an introduction, she was engaged to A and entered A's house as a "child bride." This matter was decided by A's father, and A himself never agreed to it. Now that A has reached adulthood, if he decides to dissolve this marriage, please answer:</p>
<p>Can A directly entrust a lawyer to declare the termination of the contract and order B to return to her family? Does B have the right to demand compensation for losses?</p>
<p>[Answer] Without the consent of the parties involved, minors and those reaching adulthood can claim termination of the contract. Regarding A's father adopting B, if A claims termination of the contract, expelling B is not only unreasonable but also legally untenable to shirk responsibility. Therefore, A can claim termination of the contract; A's father should recognize B as an adopted daughter. Then the second question will not arise.</p>

In terms of goods, in addition to the large-scale selling of cotton yarn by the National Bank and the US Aid Flower and Yarn Associated Office, and the large-scale sale of sugar by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the Central Bank also resumed unlimited supply and sale of gold in the gold market yesterday. The supply was unlimited according to the needs of the market. As a result, more than 6,000 large bars were sold, setting a new record since the selling policy was implemented. All parties' appetites reached saturation, leading to a rise in the daily overnight interest rate from 60-70 yuan in the morning to over 200 yuan outside the customs around 3:00-4:00 PM. Credit was unprecedentedly tight. According to a related official from the National Bank, "If some banks and firms take in a large number of gold bars and do not find a way to make up for it later, more than ten firms will inevitably face closure due to their inability to balance their positions."</p>
<p>Furthermore, Lin Chongyong, Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, responded to reporters' inquiries yesterday with a victorious smile. He said, "No matter how big the market's appetite is, we have decided to supply as much as possible today. If they eat until their stomachs burst, that is not our fault!" Then, Mr. Lin asked reporters, "How are prices today?" All reporters reported that they were falling. Mr. Lin repeatedly said "Good, good" and looked extremely pleased.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Credit was not tight yesterday morning, with the daily overnight interest rate between 70 and 80 yuan per thousand. At 9:50 AM, the price of gold reached its limit, and the National Bank began to sell without limit. Credit tightened, and by 11:00 AM, the daily overnight interest rate had risen to 90-100 yuan. By noon, due to the liquidation of floating positions, the secret interest rate slightly decreased, and the daily overnight interest rate returned to 85-95 yuan. However, the market quickly learned that the National Bank's selling volume was huge, and all industries' positions were tight. It was also rumored that bills could not be used for payment, so the secret interest rate in Shanghai was high. Therefore, the secret interest rate after the close of trading rose to 150-250 yuan per thousand of the daily overnight interest rate, setting an unprecedented record. Some banks were in a precarious situation due to their inability to balance their positions. The National Bank then bought gold at a price of 990 to provide positions, and the secret interest rate decreased slightly, to about 200 yuan of the daily overnight interest rate. It is rumored that two small banks will suspend exchange starting today due to position issues.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market experienced unpredictable fluctuations, with the market trend being volatile and unstable. In the morning, due to the two-day call loan interest rate, the opening price immediately reached the upper limit of 1,256,000, a surge. Amidst this, due to strong market confidence, it stood firm at a high peak for quite some time. Around 11:00 AM, the Central Bank entrusted Dadecheng Gold Firm to sell off unlimitedly at a price of 1,250,000, vigorously releasing as many as 6,163 taels, squeezing into a total of 77.00375 billion. Market confidence softened, and many holders rushed to sell, with retail investors flocking to sell, gradually declining to 1,215,000. The noon closing price slightly rose to 1,220,000.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, due to tight credit conditions and high off-market interest rates reaching around two yuan, buying interest from all sides dissipated, and the market trend lacked the strength to rise. The opening price was 1,190,000, slightly higher to 1,200,000. Gold firms, securities firms, and others took positions, gradually declining to 1,100,000. In the last fifteen minutes before closing, it became increasingly unsustainable. Under the competition from Guangdong banking groups and others, the market conditions plunged sharply in a straight line, falling all the way into the million mark, reaching a low of 990,000. The closing price barely stood at 993,000, a rebound of 54,000 less than last weekend. Inter-bank clearing transactions were at 1,235,000 in the morning and also retreated to 1,095,000 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Off-Market</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Off-market trading was active. The morning opening prices were 1,260,000 and 1,270,000, reaching a high of 1,270,000 and 1,223,000. The afternoon opening prices were 1,195,000 and 1,200,500, reaching a high of 1,215,000 and 1,225,000, and a low of 1,175,000 and 1,180,000. The closing prices were 1,185,000 and 1,190,000, also a decline of 85,000. The overnight interest rate was increased by 140,000 per tael, with asking prices reaching 1,325,000 and 1,330,000.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the price of ornamental gold at silver shops experienced ups and downs. The morning price was listed at 1,220,000 and 1,320,000. In the afternoon, it rose to 1,300,000 and 1,420,000, and finally fell to 1,280,000 and 1,400,000, an increase of 270,000 compared to last weekend. The price of ornamental silver also rose by 2,000, reaching a high of 1,283,000 and 15,000. Money exchange businesses were in a difficult situation. The morning price was listed at 1,250,000 and 1,280,000. At noon, it fell to 1,180,000 and 1,210,000. There were no changes in the afternoon.</p>
<p>US Dollars</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the off-market morning opening prices for US dollars were 25,000 and 26,000, reaching a high of 26,500 and 27,500, and a low of 24,000 and 25,000. The noon closing prices were 24,500 and 27,500. The afternoon trend was relatively stable. The opening prices were 24,500 and 25,500. Midway, due to exceptionally tight positions and limited demand from all sides, it fell to 23,500 and 24,500. The closing prices were 24,000 and 25,000, a decline of 1,000 compared to last weekend. The overnight interest rate was increased by 3,000, with asking prices reaching 27,000 and 28,000.</p>
<p>Silver Dollars</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, there was a lot of arbitrage trading of silver dollars. Changsha used silver dollars for arbitrage, with the price quoted in Gold Yuan Certificates. The exchange rate was 8 yuan higher and 6 yuan lower per hundred yuan. Drafts were Shanghai Zhuang notes, payable one day late upon sight, converted into the local silver dollar price. Telegraphic transfers had a much higher exchange rate than drafts. However, there were also reverse arbitrage transactions, where Shanghai Zhuang and Hakka merchants directly used telegraphic collection. After receiving the money, Shanghai paid the equivalent silver dollar price of the day. In Tianjin and Beijing, the Northern Merchants engaged in fifteen-day forward drafts at the equivalent price. The arbitrage price could be directly passed through without taking an exchange fee, that is, the silver dollar conversion price on the day of the exchange. After fifteen days, the other party paid the equivalent silver dollars. It is said that there was also arbitrage trading of US dollars, but the amount was not large, mostly small remittances to family members, to avoid the conversion losses between People's Banknotes and Gold Yuan Certificates.</p>
<p>Street trading started strong but weakened later. The morning opening price for large heads was quoted at 22,000 and 23,000. In the afternoon, due to the sharp drop in gold prices, holders flocked to sell, gradually declining from 21,000 and 22,000. By evening, the asking price had fallen to 20,000 and 21,000. Small heads were quoted at 15,000 and 16,000, and Dragon Eagle silver dollars were quoted at 11,000 and 12,000. Money exchange businesses engaged in cross-trading of large heads. The initial price for same-day checks was 24,000 and 26,000, but later it also declined to 22,000 and 23,000, a slight increase of 1,000 compared to last week.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Speculative Funds Seek Outlets, Twists and Turns in the Trend of Chinese Stocks <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the Chinese stock market opened high and closed low, with a tortuous market trend. There was a multi-directional attack on the market, with the trend repeatedly falling and rising. However, due to the strong gains last week, market confidence improved again, and off-market speculative funds continuously flowed back, so new buying was very strong. If there were no threats from gold selling, the rising momentum would still be strong. Yong Yarn opened high at 18 yuan. It was heard that the gold and silver market had relaxed its limits yesterday, and the pressure on the industry would inevitably be strong. Large investors were very sensitive, and the short selling momentum was very strong in the morning, with the price declining to 17 yuan. Later, it was heard that the national treasury disbursed military and administrative expenses, with as much as 30 billion flowing out, and credit conditions eased. The off-market interest rate fell to six jiao, and the off-market interest rate also fell to seven jiao and seven jiao five. New buying surged from both inside and outside the market. Banking groups, securities groups, and large investors such as Zheng Zhongren vigorously bought in, and it rose again to 18 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen. Subsequently, the Central Bank sold a large amount of gold, off-market short sellers were active, and the market trend declined again, falling to 17 yuan 2 jiao. Yarn companies supported the market again, and it rose again to 18 yuan 1 jiao. Near noon, tight credit conditions became apparent, and the bulls were unable to struggle, finally closing at 17 yuan 6 jiao at noon.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks all opened at high prices, and the noon closing price saw a return to parity. Xinyi and Xinguang once reached the upper limit. Xinhua Department Store, Tongyi, Yonggong, Taiwan Sugar, and others all reached their limits. Qinxing, Fuhua, Feng, and others also uniformly moved upwards. The remaining stocks all rose after opening, and the noon closing price was stable.</p>
<p>In the after-market, credit conditions were extremely tight, and the off-market interest rate was surprisingly high. Gold industry groups certified that securities groups were eagerly seeking orders, and the daily interest rate was shouted up to around two yuan. Floating sales resumed, and the market conditions initially opened softly. Later, due to the easing of credit conditions, short positions from the previous market were covered, and the closing price rose again, finally creating a high price of 19 yuan 1 jiao.</p>
<p>Off-market trading initially traded at 17 yuan 3 jiao, fell to 16 yuan 05 fen, and finally closed at 16 yuan 7 jiao. The remaining stocks all rebounded compared to the previous market, with a turnover of 4.6334 billion shares.</p>

<p>The yarn market opened in the morning. It was heard that gold had reached the upper limit, and credit conditions were easing. Guangdong merchants continued to absorb, and the local market was also optimistic, buying on dips. The front-end merchants took advantage of the momentum to pull up prices, and the holders insisted on not letting go. Various yarns were thriving.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 8.5 million yuan, and midway reached the 9 million mark. Near noon, many holders sold to take profits, and the price fell back to 8.75 million yuan, a result of an increase of 850,000 yuan compared to Saturday. 40-count Blue Phoenix surged by 1 million yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened in the morning at 5.6 million yuan, once tapped 6 million yuan, and then detoured down, finally trading at 5.7 million yuan, an ultimate increase of 450,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse opened at 4.38 million yuan, reaching a high of 4.56 million yuan, and closed at 4.42 million yuan at noon, an increase of 350,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse broke through the barrier, seeing a new high price of 4.34 million yuan, an increase of 460,000 yuan compared to the previous high. Various grades below 16 counts also rose accordingly.</p>
<p>The rising trend of cotton cloth became increasingly crazy. Due to the gradual easing of credit conditions and the sharp increase in off-market goods, market sentiment was volatile, retail investors were scrambling to buy, and holders vigorously pulled up prices, so the price rose in a straight line.</p>
<p>The leading fine cloth opened in the morning and saw a high of 192,000 yuan. Midway, it once tapped the 200,000 mark. Near noon, it was reported that the national bank was selling a large amount of gold, and the general credit conditions were tightening. Sensitive people hurriedly sold, and the price saw a low of 191,000 yuan. Near the closing, short positions were slightly covered and rebounded, finally closing at 196,000 yuan at noon, a surge of 50,000 yuan compared to the weekend.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Central Serge surged by 43,500 yuan from 272,000 yuan to 173,500 yuan. The 190 high-end Shilin factory plate even opened at 432,000. In the after-market, all parties were generally in a wait-and-see attitude, and there were not many transactions, totaling 200,000 for the leading fine cloth and 180,000 for Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Market Stroll <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— A Spectator</p>
<p>The Trend is Terribly Large, All Banks and Businesses are Shaking</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was extremely serious. It is more serious to say that today's market will be even more serious.</p>
<p>The stiff ×Four Banks×, ×Four Banks×, etc., all say they want to stop accepting bank drafts for cash. Last night, almost all had problems. Large and small banks and businesses worked overnight. As of this writing, there are still fifty or sixty that cannot be settled.</p>
<p>This trend can be said to be the first of its kind since the victory. Because the Central Bank vigorously sold off taels at noon, everyone blamed the Central Bank. And the Central Bank, of course, blamed it on the comprehensive surge in various market prices yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Now, it is not a matter of shirking responsibility, but how to get through the gate. Last night, the Central Bank opened the door wide. During the day, the price of gold rose to more than 12 million, and the Central Bank also sold off at a high price of 11 million or 12 million. But late at night, the Central Bank bought back at 9 million, breaking out a position to maintain banks and businesses. This money can be said to have been earned handsomely.</p>
<p>From the perspective of cracking down on speculation, the methods can be said to be ruthless. But who opened up speculative trading in gold and silver? What is called cracking down on speculation? Promoting speculation first and cracking down later, isn't this joking with merchants?</p>
<p>From the perspective of stabilizing the market, it can never be achieved with such a public market policy. Unless a thorough cleanup is done.</p>
<p>There are so many large and small banks and businesses in this city, and the licenses are all issued by the Ministry of Finance. Having reached such a point, the Ministry of Finance cannot but bear full responsibility.</p>
<p>A most serious problem is that some say that so-and-so etc. have stopped accepting bank drafts. What kind of system is this? If bank drafts can be stopped, then the credit of the issuing banks and businesses is ruined. How can they still be allowed to exist?</p>
<p>But the issuing banks and businesses can also spread out their reasons, because they do not have cash positions. Then the responsibility lies with the Central Bank.</p>
<p>In fact, being anxious is superfluous. Look, it's not that "the boat will naturally straighten when it reaches the bridgehead," but that the Central Bank and this group of big bosses are all touching feet to feet. Face-saving is done behind the scenes. Everyone can pass safely, and the unlucky ones are still the manufacturers and the general public who still hold bank drafts.</p>
<p>From today on, all merchants and people in the city should remember that it is really dangerous to take bank drafts today when they are being issued indiscriminately. To be honest, the checks of reputable manufacturers are more credible than those of banks and businesses. Now many people choose bank drafts and do not welcome checks, which is the most easily deceived misconception.</p>
<p>Leaving aside this trend, let's talk further about the impact on the market. The first is that the stock market will collapse. The major bull Zheng Zhongchen is too late to come out. Then the overnight interest rate is as high as more than 3.5 yuan. If you calculate it, it is not that you can pass the 20 yuan mark. But can you withstand it? It's hard to say, really hard to say.</p>
<p>As for the general commodity market, it will also collapse in a daze. However, importantly, it will not affect retail market prices. Small citizens have a share in the rise, but not in the fall.</p>
<p>Counting gold, banknotes, and silver dollars, they were also dragged down very badly last night. But no matter how much it changes, the overall situation needs to be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Commodities May Collapse in a Daze, but Small Citizens Will Not Benefit</p>

<h3 id="e113">Baseball Season is Coming, Panda Team Begins Intense Training, Establishing a Training Class to Solve the Referee Shortage <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] This year's Happy Valley Baseball Open is being actively prepared by the organizer, the International Sports Association, and will begin in the near future. Many teams are participating, and the grand occasion has decreased last year. Various persons in charge and team coordinators in the softball world have been busy running around to prepare various procedures recently. The referee training class established to address the shortage of referee talents has also begun classes.</p>
<p>The defending champion, the strong Panda team, aware of the imminent softball competition, has begun intense training to maintain its past. Every Sunday, they practice for two hours at the Jiaotong University stadium, still under the guidance of "Father Panda" Mr. Liang Fuchu. In terms of lineup, catcher Cao Kejia has gone to Taiwan and may return to Shanghai in the near future. Therefore, the catcher position has been changed to veteran Wang Qingrui. Qingrui has been out of the glove for a long time, and his skills are inevitably rusty, but after several intense training sessions, he has gradually regained his former appearance. The Panda team has also recruited two athletes from Jiaotong University to help out.</p>
<p>On the women's side, the runner-up, the Shengdeng team, which once dominated, has not yet begun its activities. The team's pitcher, Cheng Molan, a Shanghai National Games representative, has a foot injury and may not be able to run on the field again this year. Third baseman Cai Binqiu and one, Gu Yi, have gone to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Therefore, this year, Shengdeng may merge with the Racoon team of the McTyeire School, selecting the best and competing with the foreign teams.</p>
<p>[Another report] According to the person in charge of the referee training class: The class currently has fifteen new students and has already had six classes. However, in order to create new talents, those who are interested in learning are still welcome to register and join. The registration office is in the US Navy Sports Department of the Happy Valley Racecourse. (You Xin)</p>
<h3 id="e114">Hong Kong Grass Court Tennis Ends, Xu Brothers Retain Doubles Championship Seven Times, Ye Guanxiong Injured, Hui Tang Cannot Work Miracles Alone <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Aviation News] April 1st was the date for the doubles final of the Grass Court Open Tennis Tournament, which is also the finale of the entire competition. The match was between the Xu brothers, Wei Pei and Run Pei, and Ye Guanxiong and Li Huitang. The number of spectators was the highest of all the matches. After an hour and twenty minutes of fierce fighting, the Xu brothers ultimately won again with a score of three to one due to their deeper tacit understanding, and won the Hong Kong Doubles Championship for the seventh time. Counting from the Xu brothers' initial victory in the Doubles Championship in 1936, they subsequently swept Hong Kong in 1928, 1939, and 1941. From 1943 to 1946, Hong Kong fell and the competition was not held. After the war, in 1947, the competition was reopened, and the three also Doubles Championships all went to them. Their achievements are brilliant and gratifying. As for the Doubles Championship since the Hard Court Open Tournament, it has never fallen into the hands of others. Also, the Mixed Doubles Open Championship after the war has also twice gone to the Xu brothers and the women they paired with, which is not the subject of this article, so I will not elaborate on it.</p>
<p>The slow-to-warm-up Xu brothers still lost their standard in the initial round, especially the elder Xu, making numerous mistakes. In addition, Ye Guanxiong performed extremely well, and Li Huitang also had an excellent performance. As a result, Li led all the way, winning five games straight. Only then did the Xu brothers manage to take back one game. In the seventh game, the Xu brothers lost again. Thus, Ye and Li won a big victory with a score of six to one. Xiongwei was particularly strong, almost controlling the entire game. In the first game, Ye served first and lost only two points before winning. The last point was Li Huitang's successful high-pressure shot. In the second game, Run Pei served, and the game was tied twice, but ultimately Ye won. In the third game, Huitang served, and the game was also tied once, but Ye and Li ultimately won. In the last point, Hui's serve was strong, and Xiao Xu's shot immediately hit the net. The fourth game was also lost by Wei Pei's serve. In the fifth game, Ye sent out an ace ball, suddenly making it impossible for the elder Xu to grasp. In this game, during the fierce battle, Guanxiong accidentally sprained his ankle when jumping high, but he was still able to fight bravely and only lost one point before winning again. After the fifth game, he hurriedly put on rubber ankle support before continuing the game. However, his sprinting was obviously not as good as before, so he lost the sixth game, and then worked hard to win the seventh game and won the first set. This set lasted fifteen minutes. Ye Guanxiong had one "ace" ball. None of the four had double errors. By point count, the Ye and Li group scored a total of 30 points, and the two Xus only got 9 points.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second set, the Xu brothers' level still had not fully recovered. The elder Xu served first, and although he caught up to a tie three times, he still lost in the end. In the second game, Ye served and won again, losing only one point. At this time, Ye's running was slightly unsteady, and the Xu brothers seized the opportunity to launch an offensive. Because Ye's running was not very convenient, he had to switch to a defensive posture. As a result, they chased back to a 2-2 tie. But in the fifth game, Wei Pei lost again due to a careless ball, and Ye and Li still led by three to two. At this point, they suddenly rose up and won two games in a row, initially leading by four to three. In the eighth game, Ye's divine power was greatly demonstrated, and he used a blitzkrieg method, and advanced back to a four-to-four tie. At this point, the Xu brothers jointly attacked Huitang, forcing Li to play ground balls, which he was not very good at. As a result, they began to gain a net profit in the ninth game. They also only lost one point in the tenth game before winning. Thus, the Xu brothers took back the second set with a score of six to four, becoming a one-to-one situation. This set also had no double errors. Ye had one "ace" ball. It took 23 minutes to complete the game. It is said that Ye was able to lead until the fifth game after injuring his ankle. If Ye had not been injured, the situation might not have been the same. If Li and Ye were able to win the second set again, it is unknown whether the Xu brothers would be able to retain the doubles championship this year. This is not an excessive statement.</p>
<p>In the second set, the Xu brothers first won a net game, and then lost two consecutive games. In the fourth game, Huitang made a double error in a tense situation, and was chased by the Xu brothers to a 2-2 tie. In the elder Xu's serve, both heroes were vying for the ball, and Huitang also performed well. As a result, the Xu brothers fell behind again with a score of two to three. At this point, the Xu brothers realized their level, and with net profits, they broke Kai's serve, and directly won the advantage of leading by five to two. The serve was chased back by Ye and Li to four to five. In the tenth game, although Ye served, it was still impossible to stop the progress of the Xu brothers. Thus, the Xu brothers won again with a score of six to four. This set also lasted 23 minutes. The Xu brothers scored a total of 35 points, and Ye and Li 27 points. The whole set had no ace balls, and Huitang had one double error.</p>
<p>In the fourth set, there were fierce battles in the first two games. After repeated ties, the victory ultimately belonged to the Xu brothers. After this, the elder Xu's level gradually recovered, and he repeatedly used high balls or earth balls to push Huitang back. As a result, he won three games straight, lost the fourth game, and then won three games straight, achieving a 6-1 victory, or a 3-1 ratio, and won the championship again. Although the number of games was far apart, it still took 21 minutes to complete the game. The Xu brothers scored a total of 34 points, and Ye and Li scored 23 points. Counting the entire game, the Xu brothers won 123 points, and Ye and Li took 108 points. After the game, the award ceremony was presided over by the daughter of the Vice-Supervisor of the University of Hong Kong and Commander of the Self-Defense Forces, Miss Lai. Then, there was a vegetable party.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Class A First Division of the Basketball League, Only Three Games Remaining <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Basketball League Class A First Division is coming to an end, with only the last three games remaining, namely the Haiqing team vs. Enkas team tomorrow, and the Shanghai Camp vs. Haiqing and the Hualian vs. Enkas on Friday (8th). After this, all the games of the Class A First Division will be completed. As for the rankings of the top three in the Class A First Division and the Women's Division, the champion of Hualian has already been decided, even if they lose to Enkas, it will not be a problem. The runner-up is Renyu. If Shanghai Camp wins Haiqing, they will be tied for third place with Huili. If Enkas wins Haiqing and loses to Hualian, they will be ranked fifth. If they lose unexpectedly and defeat the champion Hualian, they will be on the same level as Huili Shanghai Camp. All the games in the Women's Division have been completed. The Green Team maintains its undefeated championship, the runner-up is the Li Team, the third place is Xinghua, the fourth is John, and the fifth is the Li Team.

<h3 id="e116">Tonight's Three Games are All in Class A Second Division <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Basketball League will end tonight, and the order of three games, all in Class A Second Division, will still start at 5:30 PM, competing in the gymnasium, and the tickets will remain the same as before. First, 2B Huili vs. Hezhong. Huili has won three games in a row and maintains its undefeated record with the Police Machine, and has the highest voice for winning the championship. Hezhong's strength is relatively mediocre, and it is difficult to expect any achievements, so Huili will definitely be able to play a triumphant song smoothly. The second game is Class A 2C Jianle vs. Pei'er. After Jianle defeated Meiqi, the hope of winning the championship has turned over. If they win today, their record will be equal to that of the American army, and the winner will be judged based on the points gained and lost. Pei'er has two wins and two losses. In terms of strength, they are not weak, but Jianle's morale is high, and they are afraid of being forced to surrender. The last game is Class A 2A Kang Team vs. Storm. The Kang Team's lineup is quite strong, with both Lu Da and Jin Xun. They have lost by one or two points respectively, which is a pity. Storm is composed of South Myanmar students, and although the cooperation is good, it is difficult to resist the fierceness of the Kang Team. The order of the three games is as follows: Huili -- Hezhong (Class A 2B) 5:30 PM Jianle -- Pei'er (Class A 2C) 6:30 PM Kang Team -- Storm (Class A 2A) 7:30 PM</p>

<p>This week's football league schedule will be announced today, but it is said that the football referees will travel to Hangzhou as a group, and the competition may be suspended for a week. If this is true, then the Railway Team, the champion of this year's Mayor's Cup, will invite the Tung Wah Team to have a friendly match at Yiyuan on the afternoon of the weekend (10th). According to the Railway Team, there are national players such as Gao Baozheng, the new champion, and the momentum is strong. Tung Wah has not been in danger for a long time, and fans are eager to see it. At that time, there will be a wonderful performance with the Railway Team.</p>

<p>— Written by Wang Xin-jing, Edited by Chen Lin-sheng (6)</p>
<p>The generation of swinging force completely follows the dynamics of hitting the ball. According to the laws of physics, the larger the swing amplitude, the greater the swing speed, and the greater the force generated. If the swing contains acceleration, then the force generated is even greater. Before we hit the ball, we must pull the arm back, which is to increase the swing amplitude. When hitting, the action is agile, which is to seek a large speed. The wrist has a larger swing amplitude and a faster swing than the arm, which is acceleration. If the hand is not pulled back when hitting the ball, or even the racket stops moving as soon as it touches the ball, then the ball hit will inevitably touch the net and die in the net. This is because the swing amplitude is small. If the arm moves forward slowly from the back, then the ball hit will never have the hope of hitting the opponent. This is because the speed is slow. If the wrist swings with the arm without force, then the ball will inevitably be weak. This is because there is no acceleration. Therefore, the "force" of the ball is greatly related to the size of the swing amplitude and the speed of the swing.</p>
<p>Beginners often use excessive muscle strength, causing the moving muscles and antagonistic muscles to be tense at the same time, the joints are stiff, and the swing is difficult to be fluent. Even the strength of the moving muscles is eliminated. There are often times when muscle strength and swinging force are used together, which is often not as powerful as using one force alone. In fact, the swing should be natural, and the muscles should be relaxed. After practicing for a long time, you will naturally understand the benefits of using both forces together.</p>
<p>Simply having strength is useless when playing ping pong. You also need to pay attention to the point of "accuracy." This "directional control," the ability to control the ball, and the direction of the arm swing, the positive and negative of the ping pong racket, the point of force application, the direction of the incoming ball... are all of great importance. After a considerable period of practice, this "accuracy" skill will not be difficult to understand intuitively.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Sleepwalking and Witchcraft <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>I remember that in March, this column published an article about "sleepwalking." This made me think of a witch-like sleepwalking phenomenon in my hometown.</p>
<p>In the temples of my hometown, many well-known Bodhisattvas are enshrined. Because the names of those Bodhisattvas are too famous, even I, who am not very familiar with my hometown, know a few, such as: Third Lord, Marshal He Da, Stone Spiritual Officer, Second Spiritual Officer, Yuan Changshi, etc. When people encounter danger, they chant their Dharma names. When they get sick, they bring their golden statue to their home, brew a cup of tea, offer it in front of the Bodhisattva, sprinkle some incense ash into the tea, and the patient will get better after drinking it; this is for minor illnesses. What if it is a serious illness? That's not simple. At this time, they either seek famous doctors on the one hand and invite famous Bodhisattvas on the other hand; or, stubbornly refuse doctors and rely entirely on the Bodhisattvas. Usually, each Bodhisattva has a fixed witch, which we call "disciple" in our hometown. These "disciples" are usually ordinary farmers and craftsmen. However, when the Bodhisattva they follow wants to cure people, they suddenly become "spiritual."</p>
<p>There are many ways to cure diseases. Here, I will only talk about the general situation: The so-called "disciple" lies on the bed and sleeps soundly. The Bodhisattva is enshrined in the hall, gongs and drums are played together, incense is burned, and paper is burned to invite the Bodhisattva to descend. Sometimes after making a fuss like this for a night, what is the situation when the Bodhisattva arrives? That is, the "disciple" suddenly jumps up from the dream, shakes violently with the upper body naked, rushes to the hall, and jumps and dances. Then, on the table in front of the god, they point to books and speak. Often, a person who is illiterate at this time can recite elegant verses (unfortunately, I cannot give those verses now). After the poem is completed, the prescription is written. The prescriptions are all strange and unreasonable things, such as: goose dung, a certain kind of soil, are also listed. What is strange is that the patient does not take effect, and there is not much harm. After the prescription is finished, the "disciple" suddenly shouts "My god is leaving," and then falls backward. Everyone helps him up and prostrates him on the table for a while, and then he returns to normal.</p>
<p>When the "disciple" is sleeping, sometimes people can hear him mumbling outside, as if talking to someone. It is said that this is talking to the Bodhisattva!</p>
<p>In addition, there is a rare situation: when the "disciple" has an attack, they can be on a sharp blade.</p>
<p>What is recorded above is what they said in my hometown. Because this trick looks similar to sleepwalking on the surface, so I tentatively record it.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Coupons and Circles <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Chen</p>
<p>Some people say: the "coupon" in Gold Yuan Coupon cannot bear to be interpreted as "circle." The reason is: the more "coupons" are issued, the more "circles" are added to the price list? On the other hand, the bodies of ordinary people seem to be getting tighter and tighter, circle after circle, by this inexplicable "circle," and they can hardly breathe. However, who can say that this "coupon" is not that "circle"!</p>
<h3 id="e126">San Yuanweng's Kindness and Forgetfulness <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>The great American writer Mark Twain was out for a walk one evening when he met a postman. He stopped and asked, "Do you have any letters for me?" The postman said, "Okay, what is your name, sir?" Mark Twain scratched his head and thought for a long time, but he couldn't remember it. He had to say awkwardly: "Let me go home and ask." The postman smiled and left.</p>
<p>Song Jiang's Notes on Bizarre Matters has a record of Wang Wenzheng Gong Dan's forgetfulness: "And there was a horse groom who asked to resign after his term expired. The Duke asked, 'How long have you been leading my horse?' He replied, 'Five years.' The Duke was surprised and said, 'Why don't I remember having you?' He gave him a small gift and sent him away. After he left, he called him back and said, 'Are you so-and-so?' He replied, 'Yes.' Then he gave him another generous gift. The person usually led the horse, and the Duke only saw his back, not his face, so he did not recognize him. When he left and saw his back again, he recognized him as so-and-so."</p>
<p>People forget their own names, and they don't recognize the face of their own horse groom for five years. People must not believe such strange things. The rest of what I know about San Yuanweng's anecdote, his forgetfulness is no less than that of the ancients, and it is quite laughable. I will describe it now.</p>
<p>San Yuanweng originally lived in a house on Shangsi Tiao Lane, Qingxi, Nanjing. During the Wuchang Uprising on October 10th, Zhang Xun fought with the civilian army in Nanjing. San Yuanweng and his family came to Shanghai and lived on Old Baizi Road. In the first year of the Republic of China, he returned to Xishan, Nanchang, Jiangxi to return to his ancestral grave. The Jianglun boat docked, and his servant hired a carriage for San Yuanweng to carry his luggage. When he arrived at Old Baizi Road, a row of foreign houses, all with the same style, San Yuanweng could not enter his door, and he did not remember the house number. The carriage hovered on the road for a long time, and the coachman said, "Can you recognize which house?" San Yuanweng said, "I recognize that foreign house." The mansion of Li Gongguan on Chongqing Road was the residence of Li Jingyi (who served as the Governor-General of Yunnan and Guizhou during the late Qing Dynasty). This place was a lane house, and there was only one large foreign house near Weihaiwei Road, so San Yuanweng could recognize it without error. Li Mugong (named Guosong, Jingyi's son, studied ancient Chinese literature with San Yuanweng) paid for the carriage and hired another carriage to send him home. This kind of forgetfulness of not recognizing one's own residence can probably only be done by San Yuanweng.</p>
<h3 id="e127">"Neizi" Is Not "Neiren" <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Fei</p>
<p>The Book of Rites: "Zengzi said: Daifu neizi." The note says: "Neizi, wife." Therefore, when people call their wives, they should say "neizi," not "neiren." Nowadays, people call their wives "neiren" to guests, which is a big mistake. According to the "neiren" in the Tang Dynasty, it was a term for prostitutes. Tang Zhang You's poem: "Neiren has sung the Oriole's song, swaying lightly under the willow tree." Cui Lingqin's Records of the Teaching Workshop says: "Prostitutes enter the Yichun Courtyard, which is called neiren." Neiren was an official prostitute in the Tang Dynasty. In large banquets, they were often ordered to sing to accompany the wine, similar to the geishas in Japan today. It is extremely insulting for people today to call their wives by the name of prostitutes.</p>
<p>Prostitutes are also called Biaozhi and Jiaoshu. The prostitute's other name, Biaozhi, was used by the Yuan Dynasty in the sense of "neizi," meaning an outside wife. Jiaoshu was the name for prostitutes called by the people of Shu. Hu Zeng's poem to Xue Tao: "Xue Jiaoshu is by the Wanli Bridge, living behind closed doors under the pipa." In the past, people used prostitutes to manage wine, so they were called jiu zheng, and also called lushi. But I don't know what they recorded.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Reading April Fool's Day News <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Chun Yi</p>
<p>Although the Cold War between the East and the West has reached a white-hot state, it seems harmless to play small jokes on each other on "April Fool's Day." But judging from the "fake news" fabricated by news reporters on this "April 1st," the technique is really not worth complimenting. Take Shanghai as an example. Although some people will go to the International Hotel to inquire about the news of Zhang Xueliang's release, based on the judgment of a competent news reporter's common sense of words, the possibility of releasing Zhang Xueliang in the current atmosphere of war fog is very small. I say common sense judgment refers to the fact that Zhang will not leave Taiwan for "reading and cultivating his nature" for a while under the current situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the second big news of "successful silver loan," when 50,000 to 100,000 large banknotes are about to fly all over the sky, and another financial and economic reform plan is about to be announced and implemented, anyone who is slightly familiar with the situation in the United States regarding China will immediately deny this joke.</p>
<p>Based on the above two "April Fool's news," I have come to the conclusion: the people who made this news are not very skilled in technique. Anyone with a little political common sense and a "news nose" will shrug their shoulders and say: See a ghost!</p>
<p>The third piece of news is: civil servants' salaries will be reissued in silver dollars. The news is very good. More than 3 million civil servants across China will be overjoyed, but according to Article 2, if there is no hope for the "silver loan" one day, this "beautiful dream" will also be shattered immediately. Therefore, this "fabricated" news has no basis.</p>
<p>As for making "good news," there is still something to say; but pointing out that people "commit suicide by poisoning" is not only not worth emulating, but also the intention is very terrible.</p>
<p>In fact, the biggest news of "April Fool's Day" this year is still "peace talks." It was picked on "April 1st" without being early or late. If you savor the meaning carefully, this joke is not too big or too small.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Family Background Evaluation <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>After reading Ba Jin's novel "Home," people will naturally feel disgusted by the darkness and autocratic tyranny of Chinese feudal families. Now, let's look at the movie "Home" starring Frederick March (which was shown in the Majestic Theater). All the crows in the world are black. American families are just as full of oppression, tyranny, suspicion, and selfishness, and finally force a conscientious housewife—Li Funi—to leave home.</p>
<p>Like "Gone with the Wind," "Home" is set against a story during the American Civil War. Marcus, who made a fortune in business during the North-South War, owns a grocery store in a small village in South America. Marcus loves money like his life and is stingy by nature. He focuses all his attention on money. The eldest son, Peng, is a treacherous and cunning person, but under the control of his stubborn father, he can only do the bookkeeping in the store without any ambition. The second son, Oscar, is stupid and disturbed, and falls in love with a frivolous dancer. Because his father refuses to give him money, his hope of getting married is shattered. The youngest daughter, Li Qina, is a precocious girl who acts spoiled, presumptuous, and lies. She first deceives her father, and when her eldest brother gains power, she immediately turns around and caters to her eldest brother. Marcus' wife, Li Funi, is a conscientious woman. Because her husband hoarded and speculated during the war and made a fortune by plundering, and also led the Northern Army into the country, massacring the villagers, Li witnessed it with her own eyes and felt painful in her conscience. She wanted to start a hospital to atone for her sins, but Marcus refused to give her money. Later, Marcus drove his eldest son out of the house, and Li angrily revealed the secrets of the past ten years. After the eldest son found out, he used this as a threat to force Marcus to write a note, transferring all his property to the eldest son for management at the price of one dollar. After the eldest son took power, Li asked the eldest son for money to build a hospital again, but unexpectedly she was also rejected, which made Li realize that no one in this family had humanity, and she angrily left this home that was not worth staying in.</p>
<p>What is the theme of "Home"? It is to explain that if there is no common belief, no good education, and no harmonious feelings in a family, just having money is not happiness. Marcus' family is not without money. Material enjoyment is not a problem at all. The problem is that everyone feels depressed, lonely, suspicious of each other, and scheming in spirit. The five people in the family have five different hearts. On Li Funi's birthday, everyone fought openly and secretly, and the contradictions reached their peak. In the end, this home was replaced by violence - transferred from Marcus' hand to Peng's hand. The author grasped the climax of this family struggle and used a light and compact writing style to depict this extremely brilliant cross-section of "Home". There are many humorous jokes, many sharp-tongued dialogues, and many thought-provoking maxims. This is a movie script with profound meaning.</p>
<p>If we are allowed to be picky, there is no newborn second generation in this movie script. There is no family traitor who dares to cry, dare to laugh, dare to be angry, dare to scold, and dare to fight. There is only a conscientious housewife - and in the end, she just leaves, which is too weak.</p>
<p>It's not because Frederick March is a Golden Globe Award-winning star that we are praising him randomly. Indeed, in Hollywood Westerns full of thigh pornography, this meaningful "Home" is very good.</p>
