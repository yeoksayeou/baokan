<h3>和談進入正式階段　黃紹竑今日攜報告返京　提供政府決定未來步驟　中共將派員來京聯絡說未獲證實</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中共北平電台十三日夜十時半廣播最後消息，原文如下：「中國共產黨代表團與南京國民黨政府代表團，就八項基礎的和平條件舉行的談判，已達十二天，在此十二天中，雙方就各項問題非正式的交換意見，從本（十三）日起，進入正式談判階段」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕和談初步會商，已獲相當進展，權威人士觀測，按照目前情況，在本月底前，和談可能獲一結論，該人士所稱之結論，乃包括成與敗兩方面。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕政府和談代表黃紹竑，將攜代表團之全部報告於十四日自平返京。該項報告內容係在平會談之初步結論，將為今後商談之正式依據，極為機密重要，因平·京間電訊聯絡困難，故特由黃氏親自攜返，並予說明。</p>
<p>代表團顧問屈武，亦將同機返京一行，至所有在平商談各項經過情況之資料，亦將由黃紹竑於十四日帶回，首都官方正等待此項資料，以決定未來之步驟。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕何應欽十三日在政務會議中曾就和談問題提出報告，說明政府代表團抵平十餘日來正式會議尚未開始，但會前磋商已告一段落，其全部經過，即將由黃紹竑日內返京報告。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕劉仲容十二日赴平專機中，曾攜帶政府方面所備之參考資料多件，政府代表團十三日竟日就此加以研究。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕此間傳中共亦將派員來京，負聯絡接洽之責，惟接近李代總統人士對此未予證實。</p>
<h3>待晤黃紹竑交意見　於右任改明赴平　隨行人員可能增至十人　代總統何院長婉謝第三方面邀請</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕於右任赴平期延緩一日，以待政府代表黃紹竑返京，面晤交換意見後，於十五日啓程。於氏此行為期甚暫，聞預定留平約一周左右。據確實消息：於氏赴平係應第三方面人士之邀請，其邀請信即係由第三方面人士朱蘊山，李民欣攜帶來京，並面致邀請之意，李等所攜來函件共十二通，分由李濟琛，沈鈞儒，馬寅初三氏所寫，除各致於氏一通外，餘為李代總統，何院長，居正委員人各三信，該項函件中並轉達中共方面歡迎之意，代總統等接獲專函會商後，因公務關係，不克分身，代總統，何院長，居委員均婉謝前往，並各書覆函，於十二日交朱蘊山攜返平，于氏則偕同隨員由李民欣陪同前往。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕監察院長于右任赴平期間，其職務已請副院長劉哲代理。至于氏之隨員人數，可能自五人增至十人，其人選迄今至十三日夜止尚未全部決定，大致有立委尹述賢，李世軍，邱昌渭，監委谷鳳翔，劉俊濤。均係以私人資格為于氏之隨員前往，惟邱昌渭本人不擬前往。</p>
<h3>于氏告在亦監委　北行係私人資格</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕監察院在京委員十三日下午三時半舉行秘密談話會，到監委六十餘人，在滬之副院長劉哲及監委廿餘人，均於十三日抵京參加，會中于院長曾報告和談進行情形及其應邀赴平經過。于氏特別聲明，渠之赴平係應友人之邀請，以私人之資格前往，既非代表政府，亦非代表監察院，更非代表國民黨。和談前途雖不無困難，但經各方之敦促，余仍願赴平一行，以從旁協助促成，赴平時所邀同行之監院同人，亦係以私人之名義前往，並非代表監察院。言及對和談之看法時，于氏持保留之樂觀態度稱：須多加努力。于報告畢，梁上棟起立發言，認為于氏不僅為國民黨之元老，實乃國家之元老，希望于氏平能圓滿達成任務。</p>
<h3>監院委員及職員預祝于院長壽辰</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕在京全體監委及監院職員百餘人，十三日下午六時半在空軍新生社聯合宴請于院長，預祝其七十一歲（四月十六日）壽辰，並歡送其赴平。席間于氏曾起立致詞，敘述其不願作壽之理由，並追述其身世，對其過去之艱難困苦狀況，曾縷述甚祥，言時情緒激動，各委員均為之動容，于氏復追述其民國十二年在五原誓師經過，謂當時在沙漠中，缺水，缺汽油。終於獲得成功，足證至誠所及，金石為開，只要至誠求之，不管任何艱難困苦之事，相信終必能克服。于致詞畢，李委員夢彪曾起立發言，迄晚八時許始歡散。</p>
<h3>留粵立委警告勿蹈波捷覆轍</h3>
<p>並重申和平綱領六條</p>
<p>〔聯合社廣州十三日電〕留粵立委五十一名十三日開會，決議致電南京，要求留京立委來粵考慮和平問題。據稱：共軍倘若渡江，即無和平誠意，並應負共後果責任。另一案警告南京政府勿蹈波蘭與捷克覆轍。最後一項決議，重申和平綱領六條，即（一）憲法應該維護，可能經由憲法方式修正之。（二）中國政府之形式不能改變。（三）民生自由與基本權利應予維護。（四）國共雙方應於五月一日起停戰。（五）和平條件應該公開，和談應准許新聞記者列席。（六）和談結果，應由立法院批准。</p>

<h3>中蘇航協續訂問題</h3>
<p>政院討論未獲結論</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕中蘇航空協定之續訂問題，十三日在政院例會中提出討論，蘇聯方面擬予續訂，要求有效期間為廿年，經各政委詳予研究，歷時甚久，未獲結論。</p>
<h3>立院財金及預算委會聯席審查財金案　各委意見不一未獲結論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕政院咨請審議之修正財金融改革案，十三日由立院財金委會及預算委會開聯席會提出審查，朱惠清所提請政府從遠變更對於財政金融舉措案及丘漢平實行銀本位發行銀行券案，亦一併討論，由張靜愚主席，財長劉攻蕓出席報告修正案與原案不同之點，逐一加以解釋。旋各委員發表意見，提出質訽，李雲良主張規定以金單位為統一價值標準，據云銀元不宜作統一價值計算標準，因銀元數量太少，不大使用，又易成搶購對象，造成價格上劇烈波動，渠主張仿照戰前海關金單位制，即現在的關元制擴大使用範圍，規定第一金單位等於美金四角或黃金若干，此項金單位專為價值計算標準，不發行紙幣或硬幣，每一金單位合金圓券若干，由各地央行每日掛牌，以為實際收付的標準，各級政府預算各項捐稅，交通公用事業各項費率，各項物價，各種薪給報酬（包含公務員及官兵的薪酬），各種存物及貼放貸款及其他有關交換價值的計算，均照金單位計算，銀行及金單位比例，亦由央行逐日掛牌，「銀元」，「關元」，「稅元」均可改為金單位，其他有關各條，如生產貸款，保值存款等，均用金單位來做統一的計算單位，朱惠清贊成李氏意見，並認為政府未把握本位貨幣運用，一面用銀元黃金，一面發行金圓券，以致加速金圓券的崩潰，實行銀行本位制度，只能鼓勵進口，而窒息出口。劉士薦質詢拋售黃金政策是否可以維持長久，財政部有無把握？包華國主張政府拿出本錢來，不要再搜括老大姓，能用一億外匯來改善士兵公教人員待遇，並穩定幣值，則在二三月後軍事政治必可改觀，稅收亦可有辦法。吳幹質詢四點：（一）宋子文到台，據說是為改良台幣，是否要想運用國家的黃金？（二）邊遠省份單獨建立幣制，財政部有無辦法制止？（三）財產稅何時才能籌辦出來？（四）為何不用攤派公債方式來平衡財政？劉全忠認為，修正案只是增稅辦法，但如無更好辦法，亦可攷運施行，並主張發行公債，採用金本位計算辦法。下午繼續開會，先就李雲良審查該案之修正意見逐項討論，各委員熱烈發言，綜合意見四點：（一）採行統一計算標準單位；（二）採用關元為繳納關稅及其他稅收；（四）以稅元為一切征稅標準單位；（四）依物價指數為計算標準，最後照以上四種意見提付表決時，各委員意見不一，引起激烈爭辯，至下午六時未獲結論，決定將本案提交下次院會討論。（立院其他委會開會消息刊第二版）</p>
<h3>海軍發揮威力　續創輝煌戰線　皖中北岸收復大團山</h3>
<p>〔本報蕪湖十三日電〕海軍在保衛江北橋頭堡之戰中，頃又繼安慶戰役後發揮無比威力，建立新的戰績。計自七日起，共軍陳毅部七九兩兵團，分向皖中江北土橋·裕溪口·　磯廟（蕪湖北岸）·西溪山·華陽等橋頭陣地繼續來犯，其中初以西梁山方面戰事最烈，至九日戰事亦達最高潮，終賴海軍以每小時發砲三千發之熾盛火網，協同陸軍將來犯共軍全部擊退，九日一度被共軍攻陷之西梁山前進陣地大團山亦於十三日晨全部收復。據悉：共軍以屢攻不克，十二日夜起，乃放棄西梁山，改以蕪湖對江裕溪口·　磯廟一帶為攻擊重點，迄午亦被國軍在海陸空協同下全部擊退。據海總第某江防艦隊統計週來戰果，共軍於攻土橋時傷亡達三千餘，西梁山六千餘，　磯廟三千餘，華陽二千餘，裕溪口八千餘，總計已達二萬餘人，投誠及俘虜者亦達三百餘人，其七兵團所屬之卅軍幾已全軍覆沒。</p>
<h3>中共已下令停止進攻？　江北前線普遍劇戰　各處圖渡江共軍均經擊退</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕官方另人士十三日聲稱：國防部參謀總長顧祝同，十三日以共軍後撤之行動，證實中共之停止進攻令業已頒發，至有若干地區尚在攻擊情況下者，或係因交通不便，命令未能達到之故。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕江北前線十二日夜迄十三日午前仍有戰事，其間尤以高橋（鎮江以東大港對岸）·永安洲（口岸龍窩以南江中沙洲）·何家大港（揚中北）及裕溪口·中路港（蕪湖對岸）等地戰事最烈。（一）高橋方面共軍利用該地江面狹隘，與南岸大港相距僅三華里，乃於十二日夜以各式船隻百餘，載共軍三千餘，企圖渡江，國軍為解除鎮江及京滬中段威脅，在湯恩伯桂永濟兩總司令親往策劃部暑並於空軍協同下，於十三日晨五時起，向共軍全力阻擊，激戰至晨九時半許，將來犯共軍全部擊潰，高橋及其附近之新洲·荷花池等要點全部收復外，並於當日完成該北岸橋頭堡之重建工程。（二）永安洲方面，十二日夜共軍亦以各式船隻百餘艘，由口岸龍窩向江中永安洲偷渡，至十三日晨前，經國軍全部擊退，斃傷共軍六百餘，沉船十餘艘。（三）何家大港方面，十二日夜亦有木船卅餘，滿載共軍，企圖由三江營向該港附近偷渡，經擊沉六艘，傷斃共軍二百餘，餘船紛退江北。（四）裕溪口中路巷方面，十二日夜十時起，共軍攻擊亦烈，迄十三日午時，已被守軍全部擊退。其餘江浦城北各山地，津浦南段花旗營之西安定橋，及安慶外圍，亦各有小股共軍，於十二日夜分別來犯，惟俱經國軍全部擊退。</p>
<p>〔本報蕪湖十三日電〕東流對岸望江東北漳河賽口一帶，十二日夜共軍千餘，分乘木船向大渡口東流間之吉陽企圖偷渡，經南岸守軍奮勇阻擊，至十三日晨前，共軍不支北退。</p>

<h3>英國工黨內閣的前途</h3>
<p>英國全國的郡議會於上星期內舉行改選，最後的結果雖然尚未揭曉，但據初步開票的結果，保守黨已獲得三四四席，工黨僅獲得六十八席，使工黨負責當局也不得不承認在此次競選中已遭遇嚴重的挫折。工黨機關報「每日先鋒報」為要工黨對此次失敗提高警覺起見，特別發表評論說：「如漠視上週的失敗，則將為莫大的錯誤。」凡是深切了解英國政黨政治的人，無不認為全國郡議會改選的結果如何？就是英國議會下次改選的風雨表。所以，執政四年來的英國工黨，到今天又面臨一嚴重的攷騐了。</p>
<p>英國工黨執政四年來，一直埋頭於國內社會化的建設，在內政上不能能說已有卓著的成就，尤其是工黨各領袖的刻苦努力的精神，最值得世人的欽佩；現在雖因別種緣故而致全國郡議會改選失敗，但是工黨領袖們仍在那裏繼續不斷的努力，企圖挽回已失去了的人心。據合眾社十二日倫敦電稱：英國工黨的全國執行委員會已擬就一項富於戰鬥精神的社會改革計劃，主張在永久的基礎上，加緊工商業的國營及經濟設計，凡是煉糖，水泥，工業保險，肉類批發，以及各地的自來水，都要收歸國營。在工黨的說明理由書中，提出了一句最漂亮的最新穎的最動人的口號，就是「我們將求取免受資本主義的物質束縛及奴役的自由。」這確是英國人民人人所愛聽的口號。</p>
<p>但是這個計劃，尚須留待今年六月間的工黨大會討論，獲得得大會通過後始能付諸實施，目前只能視為英國工黨的新支票，將來能否兌現，還是問題；其實這個計劃即使能成為事實，使英國人民的生活更合理化更社會化，恐怕仍難挽回工黨的逆勢。老實說，英國工黨執政四年在內政上的建樹，為任何正常的幾閣所不能及；但是現在工黨忽然走向下坡，個中原因，不在內政，而在它的外交政策。</p>
<p>在一九四五年英國大選的前夕，世界大戰雖然尚未結束，但歐洲的血幕已下，工黨對於戰後第一次大選已有十分之八九的把握，並內定貝文為外相，由其決擇英國新的外交方針；但不料貝文忽然唱出「超政黨路線」的口號，在外交行動上和保守黨幾乎沒有兩樣，對於荷印衝突不同情印尼反面支持侵略印尼的荷蘭；對於希臘問題，不擁護開明的前進的民主黨派，反而支持開倒車的希臘皇室；在聯合國的一切會議中，英國的代表沒有獨特的見解，完全以美國代表的態度馬首是瞻；在對德對日問題上，英國也是跟了美國走，美國主張締結大西洋公約，英國不僅未加考慮，反而積極從中拉攏他國參加，並不顧人民的生活負擔，提出了龐大的財政預算，使英國人民人人都感到「大砲先於牛油」的威脅。這一切的一切，無一不與英國人民的願望，背道而馳。今日英國人民所企求的，莫過於世界和平，他們對於世界局勢，都看得非常清楚，一致認為，唯有在國際和平的空氣中，英國，才能克服物質上的困難，走向繁榮的坦途。所以，戰後四年以來，英國工黨領袖在下議院報告外交時，常看到反對派的鼓掌捧場，而工黨的開明份子，反而報以噓噓之聲。這真是英國議會中空前未有的怪現象。</p>
<p>英國工黨所推行的社會政策，不僅有遠大的理想，而且最切實易行；與蘇聯政府所推行的社會主義，在本質上大同小異，原無重大出入；以此一端而論，英蘇關係的改善，不僅比任何一國為容易，而且最有希望。世人對於英國工黨的外交，也莫不寄以殷切的期望，就是希望英國走中間路線，做美蘇間的橋樑，使分裂為兩極的世界，復歸於一。可是四年以來，不僅「橋樑好夢」已成過去，而且英國對於蘇聯也視為水炭了。前日英國首相艾德禮演說，指責蘇聯應負世界分裂的責任，並謂大西洋公約非為侵略性，而係防禦性。無論艾德禮如何解釋，站在英國工黨的立場上來看，總是和它的內政政策不能配合的。這是工黨內政外交矛盾之處，也就是工黨失去選民信仰的焦點。展望一九五〇年的普選，工黨的前途，是非常黯淡的。</p>
<p>惟在今日的英國政黨政治的舞臺上，自由黨沒落了，已不算是一個主要角色；只有工黨和保守黨兩個政黨在走走馬燈。照理說，英國人民對工黨失望，唯有抉擇保守黨；但按之實際，保守黨的內政外交政策能優於工黨嗎？英國人民的眼睛是雪亮的，這次全國郡議會改選工黨的失敗，與其說是保守黨重掌政權的前奏，無寗說是英國人民對工黨所給予的警告，工黨對此，如能特別提高警覺，今後格外努力，則一九五〇年的大選的結果如何，今日言之未免過早了。</p>

<h3>西德國建立刻不容緩　盟國促速制定憲章　扶助德國經濟自給自足決減少拆卸德工業設備</h3>
<p>〔路透社波恩城十二日電〕英美駐西德議會委員會（制憲議會）之聯絡官，已於今日緊急通知該會，聲明由於世界政治局勢之趨緊，西德國之建立，已刻不容緩。通告內並責德國政黨，不應就西德憲草之每一條文，逐條吹毛求疵。自德國社會民主黨於昨日批評憲草內容無法實行後制憲工作已陷於停頓。此間德國人士認為西方盟國之催促，係恐蘇聯當局準備解除柏林封鎖，使西方佔領國不得不同意由四強重新討論整個德國問題的解決。德人並曰，自英美法在華盛頓成立關於西德之協定後，蘇聯已在積極準備採取新的作風，以阻止西德政府的成立，故若蘇聯解除柏林之封鎖，則根據去年在聯合國安理會中之君子協定，兩方國家勢不能拒絕參加四強討論，以謀整個德國問題的解決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社波恩十三日電〕負責人士今日稱，美英法正在草擬計劃，使柏林西區分立，自設議會，此項計劃等於在德國設立第二個政府。西德政府年內將成立，東德政府計劃亦宣布。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕美英法三國定今日宣布減少拆卸德賠償工廠之數目，此乃盟國扶助德國經濟自給之更進一步。聞美國最初曾提議減少拆卸工廠一六七所，最後與英法商定保留德工廠一五〇所至一六〇所。拆卸名冊上開列戰時工廠共達二千所，三年來已有數百所拆去。減少拆卸工廠之議，係美國經合總署長霍夫曼所提出，目的在使德工業貢獻於歐洲復興。法國對於此議反對最力，唯恐德軍事工業復興，最近北大西洋條約成立，法國安全感增強，三國協議成立主因殆即在此。</p>
<h3>印荷爭執與明真諦案　聯大會列入議程　印巴代表全力支持印尼</h3>
<p>〔合眾社弗魯興十二日電〕今日聯大下午以四十一對三票，表決將此歷時二十個月之印尼爭端列入議程。荷蘭衹獲得比利時及南非之支持，十二國棄權。按照聯合國憲章，大會有權討論此爭端，爭端係關於將東印度主權自海牙政府移交與荷印聯邦，包括印尼共和國在內。</p>
<p>印代表石大衛追述稱，印度最初建議將印尼問題列入議程中，渠強調稱，亞洲之人民與和平與此相關。並稱，不應輕易忘記，聯合國十九會員國，曾於新德裡集會討論印尼問題。渠稱，聯合國無疑有權對此事採取行動。渠繼稱，大會之討論將協助荷印談判之進行。（在印尼委會主持下，印荷談判定十三日在巴達維亞開始）巴基斯坦代表克安宣稱，安理會雖曾作極大努力，以解決此爭端，但同時印尼共和國之情形正惡化中。渠稱，現在印尼甚至被承認為實際的政府，此為何故？渠稱，乃因荷蘭不斷之軍事侵略。</p>

<p>照會稱，「英政府不能承認北大西洋公約係違背一九四二年英蘇條約第七條之規定，因北大西洋公約之締結乃專對侵略者而發。該照會指出英蘇條約原為促使英蘇兩國為重建和平而密切合作，但觀於一九四七年十月共產國際情報局之宣言，以及蘇聯政府迭次在聯合國所發動之宣傳攻勢，蘇政府何以不履行此項義務，實不可解。」該照會並指責蘇聯破壞波茨坦協定，尤以封鎖柏林之舉為最甚。</p>

<h3>市府平衡財政收支　計劃大綱擬訂完成　整理舊稅決定四項原則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政府陳秘書長到任後，即值本市財政最大難關之時，故於財政問題特別注意，除早夜親自料理財務案件外，並交財政局迅擬本市經費籌措辦法，俾供支應。財政局奉令後，雖於接連籌款籌鈔之緊張情形中，仍不廢是項辦法之擬訂，並於最近完成一詳盡之「本市財政收支平衡計劃大綱」，復於昨日上午九時，召集地政，公用兩局及會計處市銀行等有關機關，共同討論。關於「舊稅整理」，並經決定原則四項：（一）凡屬從價課征之稅收，應即切實樹立嚴格稽征制度。（二）凡屬固定性之課稅，應即儘可能改為機動性之稅收。（三）凡屬根據指數調整者，應即合理提高原定基數。（四）其餘征收，繳納，以及轉解，支撥等技術方面之問題，亦有極詳細之改善方案。</p>
<p>財政困難已達極點</p>
<p>會後記者並訪該局錢代局長健夫，除是否另闢新稅源問題，應予縝密考慮，及舊稅整理中，凡屬具體辦法現尚不能公佈外，對目前財政困難調度不易之情形，見告如下：目前財政之困難，可謂已達極點。報載中央印鈔亦感不繼，地方財政之窘迫，自毋待解釋。且財政整理，首貴財政秩序之安定與財政制度之確立，即令舊稅中尚有若干可以整頓者，但非提經民意機關通過，不能實行，則遠水近火，依然無濟於事，在目前經濟情形瞬息萬變，貨幣加速之貶值之際，以有限之收入，對付莫可預測之支出，自屬更見窘絀。何況擬具計劃後，自審議通過，實施征收，以至繳納稅款，必須超過一定之時間，而當此時間內，物價情形，固早已激昂上升矣。譬如房捐因捐額過低，外界嘖有煩言，甚至函局漫罵，然欲調整既非易事，亦非一蹴可就者。</p>
<p>今後局勢愈趨艱危</p>
<p>記者復詢以從價征收及依指數調整之稅捐，似應可以配合支出，而無問題。錢代局長答以無論從價或依指數調整，其解庫日期均有一定，且稅收所據之指數，多屬前期（因事實上絕不可能按當期指數即征即收），而支出則係按照支付時之物價，兩者必有一切相當距離，則赤字差額仍不能免。如公教待遇，除月底指數公佈，即須於月初照補外，同時又須照此標準預發，兩者之數額即甚鉅大，但在月底月初之數日內，無論如何搶征，亦不足以應付支出。況今日之財政問題，對如何收支適應，因為當務之急，而如何籌措現鈔，亦為重要問題，蓋發給現鈔與否，與同仁福利，關係亦甚密切也。在同仁言，綜計所得仍屬杯水車薪，但在主持此事者，實已竭盡無窮力量。今後局勢，當愈趨艱危，時值非常，自應盡瘁以赴，並望正式局長早日發表，當能另覓理想途徑，以解決此困難云。</p>

<h3>發救濟金引起糾紛　馮雲提起自訴　指揮劉哲誹謗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東北籍立法委員馮雲，以監察院副院長劉哲，為東北留存關內物資清查處理委員會，於本年二月發放東北在滬難胞救濟金所引起之糾紛事件，事後於二月十四日在京對報界談話，稱渠於當月七日，在上海黃浦警分局督察長室，持槍威脅莫德惠氏，強索央行二千萬元支票一紙，並迫莫氏陪同兌現後始去，指渠於光天化日之下，形同盜匪綁票等語，純屬子虛，當已由本市警察局督察處長張維仁發表聲明正式否認，說明「莫柳老之到督察室，係自動前來，並由大連市長趙惜夢，國代趙金璧等十餘位先生陪同到達者，至所傳莫氏被綁一節，全非事實」可為明證。且渠之參加協助發放難胞救濟金，係應莫柳老之邀請，就渠個人身份而言，亦斷不致出此粗暴之行為，劉氏竟以身居監察院副院長之尊，對渠橫加污衊，乃委請張毓鵬律師，以刑事訴訟法長三百十一條，向本市地院提起自訴，控劉誹謗罪嫌，並請判令登報道歉更正。馮氏訴狀，已於昨晨送達地院，其本人現在台灣，開庭時如尚未來滬，即委請張律師代表出庭辯護，地院方面表示將於短期內，即依法進行審理。被告傳票則將逕送南京監察院轉交。</p>
<h3>房屋糾紛牽涉軍人　退回傳票拒不到庭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕單世榮，金麗林係黃時良之三房客，雙方前因租賃糾紛，素不和睦。本年三月七日單金兩人欲將承租之建國西路九六弄十三號樓上房間，租讓與馮某居住，恐黃不允，乃於同日下午七時許，邀同上海市民眾自衛司令部人員王達，張金華，姚天福，吳怡生，王德昌前來助勢，以便強制搬遷，致與黃發生衝突。單金唆使王等五人將黃毆打成傷，經黃報警拘局，移送地檢處偵查起訴。本月五日地院發出傳票，王等由其司令部副官代收，昨晨地院歐聲和推事開庭，王等竟持其軍人身份，飭人退回傳票，聲稱因公不到。庭上對此甚表震怒，當即諭知每一國民均有應法院傳訊之義務，囑令下次不得抗傳。</p>
<h3>新藥業分呈主管機關　勿規定藥品輸入比率　並請准其向國外直接定購</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市新藥業公會，為藥品繁多，應勿規定輸入比率，且藥品輸入，應歸新藥業直接定購，毋庸進口商轉定，以應需要而收實效，頃將分呈行政院，經濟部，輸管會等有關主管機關請求採納旅行。</p>
<p>據該業各領袖人士語記者稱：按規定藥品輸入比率，其中成藥限制甚嚴，致造成本市原料充斥，價格多跌至國外採購成本之下。而吾國製藥工業，大多僅能加工包裝，未足以言實際製造。故國人需要著名之成藥，惟有輾轉設法搜求，結果造成大批走私，而走私之供應量，竟已佔著名成藥需要量百分之八十。是既不能撙節外匯，抑且損失國稅。又藥品之支配採購，須有專門智識與經驗，茲進口商所定之藥品與數量配製，不合實際需要，且定價高昂，再加佣金，尤增到貨之成本。故渠等希望關於輸入藥品比率，無論原藥成藥，應隨時視其需要用作標準，不宜予以規定。同時，藥品輸入，應歸新藥業直接向國外廠家或其經理處定購。值茲政府改訂輸管細則，以補充財金改革方案之際，特披瀝實情，以備參考採納云。</p>
<h3>邊區各省縣　金圓券絕跡　郵局業務無法維持　呈報交部請示辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕邇來各邊省地區民眾拒用金圓券之情形日趨普遍，據郵政總局發言人談稱：連日總局接獲各區郵局函電報告當地通貨情形，各僻遠地區，金圓券業已絕跡，而郵局仍以金圓券為媒介，以致業務無法維持，郵路遂告阻斷，員工生活困苦萬狀。綜合各地函電，其大致內容如下：廣東區之羅定·陽春·新興·安鋪·徐聞·新豐·春灣等地，一切交易均以港幣，銀元或穀米為本位。小數目則用「廣毫」。新豐等地商民均持穀米請購郵票，郵局苦以應付。貴州區之榕江·水城·威寗·三都及滇桂邊境各縣，概以銀元，廣毫及滇製半開銀元為基本通貨。雲南之墨江等處亦均拒用金圓券，通行「半開」。河口一帶且以越幣為本位。廣西之情形大致與廣東相仿。江西之石城·瑞金·興國·會昌·鄱陽·餘干以及湖南·甘·寗·青等體會亦均已拒用金圓券，一律以銀元為通用貨幣。民眾交寄郵件包裹，要求交付硬幣。惟政府財政金融當局尚無銀元與金圓券折合率之規定，郵局無法適從。且郵局如仍以金圓券為繳付郵資之唯一通貨，則郵局之收入仍為金圓券，而各該地區郵政員工生活勢難維持，此亦為棘手問題之一。郵政總局刻已將上項情形據實呈報交通部，請示解救辦法云。</p>
<h3>中行吉普肇禍案　民事部份昨開庭</h3>
<p>和談老人江庸律師　出庭辯護引人注意</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國銀行上海分行司機錢茂生，去年五月廿四日上午十時許駕該行〇三｜——九二八〇中型吉普車，駛經南京路時，因超載前車，撞倒兩路局材料處職員楊仲和，輾傷楊之足踝，並毀損其皮鞋西袴，經警局移送地檢處偵查起訴，於去年「八一九」前夕由地院判決，錢處罰金法幣一億元在案，至其附帶民訴部分，楊要求賠償精神和物質損失費法幣四億六千四百廿八萬，當時相等於白米八十石之代價，並列國行上海分行法定代理人徐維明為第二被告，該案經移民庭審理，直至昨日由何憲章推事開庭，錢應訊供述經過，稱係楊自己不慎，致為車所撞倒。徐未到，由和談老人江庸律師出庭辯護，江已久未在法院露面，一時頗引人注意。旋庭上以楊本人亦未到庭，而今時隔許久，幣制改革，不知楊對要求是否有所更改，乃諭知改期再審，於是江即匆匆離去。</p>

<h3>九江在死角上掙扎</h3>
<p>— 本報記者劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報九江十日訊〕九江，現在是成了死角上的一個衰落市場，差不多二年之前，河干，與街巷裏，往來如織的過程客擁擠的情形，今天在九江市面上，很難看到，相反的奔跑在街頭巷尾的人們，都皺著眉毛，懼怕以後的歲月，不知將怎樣挨過去，所以，九江是在死角上掙扎！</p>
<p>九江的人口，號稱十萬，現在恐怕至多衹有十萬的半數。市區商店，據不甚正確的調查統計，總數不到二千戶。在戰前，浙贛鐵路未修通前，它是負荷著江西物資吐納的重任，所以，過去這兒的運輸業，尤其是轉運業，是九江市場的一個大行業，江西所有的土產，如瓷器，茶葉，糧食，……都由此外銷，日用必需品的布疋，百貨，食鹽，……亦都從這兒進口，所以，戰前的九江，曾有一個黃金時代，就是在勝利的當時，以至去年的今朝，雖然不能與往昔相比，但市面的繁榮，依然可以保持。</p>
<p>現在，這兒的大行業，如瓷器，糧食，……外銷市場，由於整個金融界不景氣的關係，走向下坡，尤其在徐淮會戰以後，安慶戰起，最近的一個階段裏，更是爬上了死角尖上。</p>
<p>瓷業在九江，戰前有百多戶，都集中在濱江路與大中路的熱鬧市場，戰後復員時，由於東去船隻的停靠，以及東南市場的暢銷，瓷商總是笑咪咪的度過他們的歲月，所以復員時九江的瓷業，尚有九十多家，他們除了經營門市生意外，還有做京滬漢穗的外銷，現在的情形，卻一落千丈，九十多家瓷器商，因生意冷落而倒閉的已是半數以上了。</p>
<p>經安慶途中，幾次遭遇共軍的襲擊。大達公司的大豫輪，是三月廿七日離滬西上，廿九日抵達南京，卅日晨上駛，卅一日下午二時，駛經安慶下游太子磯地方，北岸共軍發現該輪目標，曾發槍射擊，有旅客王魏淑蘭受傷斃命。經過安慶附近五里墪時，因江面水淺，須靠北岸行駛，正在航行中，遭共軍密集槍砲襲擊，當有小販羅吉卿，洪來初二人受傷。二日由安慶上駛，經官洲，華陽等地，雖北岸共軍亦不時射擊冷槍，幸因天雨帶霧，目標隱避較易，該輪於三日上午抵達九江時，發現在途中遭遇襲擊致傷之旅客除王魏淑蘭中彈殞命，小販風吉卿，洪來初被砲彈擊傷左頰下及左手外，幸無他人，現羅洪兩人在潯就診，輪上被砲擊穿者七處，大如飯碗，小如茶杯，船頂三層二等就是茍延殘喘的一部份，亦是在那兒做臨死前的掙扎，去年今時一筒花邊飯碗鋪家的標價，大約在折合銀元二元左右，今日地攤貨，衹要四角半洋，若是你真願買的話，他還自願削價相售，以求一飽，江西興業公司所主辦的九江瓷廠，亦是因為在市場衰落的黑流中倒閉了。</p>
<p>航運業方面，九江尚分著長江與內河兩幫，招商，三北的外幫船輪，是屬於長江航運公會，贛江，鄱陽，和走武穴，湖口·彭澤的船輪，是屬內河業公會，凡有長江航輪，如招商，三江，以及過去的太古，每次東去或西上，都以九江為中途站，自今年三月間安慶戰事發生後，共軍逼近江岸的部隊，如華陽，望江等地，所有經過的輪只，先後遭遇共軍襲擊的，有大慶，江順，以及最近由滬冒險西上的大豫艙壁，彈痕纍纍，且有槍彈自北面板壁穿進，南面穿出，舵盤練條，包鐵管，亦中砲彈，擊穿一段，現在停泊在</p>
<p>九江的輪船，尚有招商局的海甬，三北公司的德安，上海實業公司的滬漢等輪，它們現在既不能東歸，亦不能西去，因為潯漢段的航行，雖然沒有危險，但是貨運廖廖，幾如絕跡，一條大船，光靠微小收入的客運，是不夠航行的成本，所以，它們衹好暫時在這兒休息。</p>
<p>浙贛鐵路南潯段，深入到潯陽江頭，固然是可以增進九江市場的繁榮，但是，在今日衰落千丈的九江，可憐是無法能接受這條</p>
<p>鐵路的惠施，因為市場的蕭條，金融枯竭，生意人亦沒力量向外發展。</p>
<p>現在南潯段整個的收入，尚不能維持路上經常的支出，該路駐潯辦事處負責人，亦就是為了收支懸殊而無法維持，親自去杭州，向局方謀求解決之策，在目前戰雲瀰漫的贛北，南潯路上，除了極少數的旅客，照章買票外，沿途各站的柴，米，魚，炭，都被特殊階層的單幫客，擁塞在快軍的車廂裏，奇怪的，路方查票員，對於單幫客，固然是以「不理為正常」的處理外，就是，連購票的乘客，亦予以「不查票」的優待，在這種反正常現象下，怎不呌路局虧本，甚至「垮路」呢？（寄自花園飯店。）</p>
<h3>句容的建設</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員　劉亞夫</p>
<p>〔本報句容九日訊〕縣府自完成鄉鎮電網三八一公里後，即專致公程建設，記者為明瞭其概況，特往訊問主管科陳萬瑞科長，當承說明如次：</p>
<p>計劃或搶修的路線凡三條：</p>
<p>（一）京溧（水）公路：該公路由南京至湖熟段早通車，由湖熟經縣境郭莊廟至溧水段，尚未通車，為得郭莊廟九號橋於抗戰軍興破壞，迄未興建，茲次會同江寗，溧水三縣，擬具預算準備興修中。</p>
<p>（二）句容（陽）公路：原有天健長途汽車公司行駛該路通車，時以夏雨汜濫而沖毀縣內的黃土橋，本年春由該段所在地鄉鎮保發動民夫會同駐縣雄風部隊工兵營興修完竣，已可通車。</p>
<p>（三）江防公路，工程最巨，日興民伕數千，於上月中旬興工，本月八日竣工，計分兩段：</p>
<p>1由龍潭繞營防口至下蜀，2由龍潭沿京滬鐵路平行順延東下，經倉頭下蜀至橋頭，關於1段，龍潭至三江口，路寬五公尺路面，鋪有煤渣，晴雨均可通車，由三江口經營防口至下蜀，路寬四至五公尺為土路，晴通雨阻，極稱不便，刻正加速征工加補煤渣工程。</p>
<p>3為京鎮（江）公路的中間地段，約長十八·五公里，日興民伕數千，歷時半月以上，始於本月八日工竣。關於該段搶修情形，又分三小段：</p>
<p>（A）龍潭以東至水泥廠，原有石子路，寬五公尺，完整無須修築，水泥廠以東，即緊沿青龍山，老虎山，東西馬腰山……等，山北山水溝堤至石榴園約三公里，因路南為山水溝堤，不能儘行剷除，路北為一·五至二·五公尺低積水田，不易加寬，經飭民伕將高堤南側挖掘二分之一，以加寬路基，然經修築後，亦僅寬三至四公尺，衹夠一車單行，為謀補救計，衹得加築錯車廠場二處，以給予對開車輛之使得。過石榴園有黃坭山，約長〇·五公里，原京滬鐵路穿過是山，內僅容鐵道之寬，若此公路，再由此直穿加寬，則工程浩大，誠非民伕之力所能逮，乃致以冂形繞過黃坭山邊，約二公里，寬四公尺，路面鋪有鵝卵石，晴雨均可通車。</p>
<p>（B）黃坭山東鐵路以南，經新菴廟，鉗窰，西村至倉頭街西端，約按六公尺修築，倉頭街長約一公里，路寬約三公尺許，越倉頭街經下蜀至戴公山嘴，均按六公尺修築。石子未鋪，已通車</p>
<p>（C）戴公山嘴以東至橋頭鎮西端長約二公里，原有五公尺路基，並時有裝運坭沙車輛由該鎮西端繞鎮北至車站一段約〇·二公里，僅寬三·五公尺，路南為水塘，路北為山水河，基高三公尺，已興修培寬至五公尺，車站以東至鎮江炭堵鎮西端，約長一·五公里，原路基寬五公尺，已修復平坦通車。致該路沿途橋樑約十餘座，亦由各該所在地鄉公所征用民間樹木架設工竣惟僅能載重四噸而已，又所有未鋪煤渣石子部份，亦正征用水泥廠運輸汽車，加緊運鋪煤渣石子，以利晴雨均得通車云。</p>
<p>國代余精一等　請釋放夏琫瑛</p>
<p>〔南京十二日訊〕國大代表余精一·謝麟書等卅七人，頃因國大代表夏琫瑛女士失去自由，業已二月有餘，不僅精神深受打擊，身體健康影響尤鉅，特於十二日具呈李代總統，請求迅即飭令羈押機關恢復夏代表之自由，假定夏代表果有違法之重大嫌疑，確有證據，亦應依法即交法院公開審理，以期公平而毋枉縱。</p>
<p>嘉興叛兵詭計　顏科長被刦去</p>
<p>〔吳興十一日訊〕嘉興陸軍預幹團學員張自清等一三四人，經本縣治安機關派員分赴各鄉鎮勸導，相率受撫來歸，本縣縣政府允彼等所請，已於十日派員陪送返嘉。又該團叛兵一部十日竄抵南門外道場山，本縣警察局顏總務科長自告奮勇，率領警士前往招撫，乃在該道場鄉第八保地相遇，顏科長即搖手表示招撫之意，接近與語，竟被刧而去。又：此次嘉興陸幹團異動原因，據學員張自清告訴記者稱：「本團總隊長賈亦斌，因監於（一）當前局勢，認此舉為有利行動，（二）抗戰末期集訓國內大中學生之勞績，未邀當局重視，（三）賈系幹部與幹校幹部人事摩擦，以及預幹團官員被分發工作。（四）賈之建軍理想，無法實現，故憤而出此。」</p>
<p>〔又訊〕駐禾叛變部隊，十一日退上最高峯陽塢山，憑險頑抗。縣警局顏課長前往勸導叛兵歸國，被賈亦斌扣留三天，業於十一日下午出險回局。縣稅處征收員王淦春在妙西被叛兵擄去，生死不明。聞安吉土共二百餘名，有接應叛兵模樣。</p>

<h3>川省特產　白蠟</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　周學端</p>
<p>〔本報成都十日航訊〕白蠟——川省其名特產，立春以後，清明以前，這幾天正是蠟商進山採購蠟蟲時節。川康道上，絡繹於途，成隊商幫，帶去絲綢，布疋，紙張，帶出蠟蟲輾轉返運，掛上蠟樹，經秋以後，收穫制煉，轉輸省外，由此填補四川入超漏巵，穩定了整個天府經濟的平衡。</p>
<p>蠟蟲採運</p>
<p>白蠟為蠟樹上蠟蟲所分泌，經熬煉而成，蠟樹普通為白蠟樹，水蠟樹，水貞子等。川康產地，分佈在安寗河流域西省會理一帶的，稱「大山蟲子」——山蟲；產在川西樂山峨眉灌縣一帶的，稱「霸蟲」，山蟲用以製種，霸蟲僅供收蟲。每當立春以後，一般專營購蟲的「蟲客」結伴入山，參加各山「蟲會」，並與「蟲主」議定價款，即共同上山摘蟲。其法係專僱摘工上樹，用皮紙裱糊之竹籬盛裝，滿六十斤為一挑，論挑計價。交易後即馳返原地轉售或取蠟。</p>
<p>取煉方法</p>
<p>取蠟方法是用菜葉包蠟蟲，掛置蠟樹上，蠟蟲孵化後，攝取樹枝的營養料，並食其嫩芽。夏至後，分泌白色物質，凝結滿樹，立秋以後，取蠟人將蠟抬下，盛於蒸籠中蒸熬，使其溶化，籠上僅餘樹葉及雜質，蠟則沉澱於鍋中，然後取出盛於木盆內，此為第一次所煉之白蠟，稱為「牙子」，再經提煉，即成純蠟。尚有黃蠟，為家蜂或野蜂之蜂房，於提取蜂蜜後，經沸水溶解而製成，川中各地皆產，廣元中霸最著。</p>
<p>產量用途</p>
<p>川省白蠟，盛時年產十五萬擔，　銷全國，而以上海，廣州，漢口為主要市場。國外遠銷英美南洋一帶，年在萬擔以上，（黃蠟年產四萬餘公斤，）品質之佳，產量之富，獨步全國。用途極廣，工業上可製蠟燭，醫藥上用造丸藥外殼及各種模型。這是四川輸出品主要特產之一，採運煉製是艱苦的，山路崎嶇，道途不靖，今年蟲客，死傷累聞，由於這血汗累積，才造就了今天四川的外銷繁榮。</p>

<h3>市場米價緊叩五關　社局下令停做交易</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨又上漲，金價報升，使人心堅昂，況產地價高，到貨稀少，供應不暢。南市場初漲二三萬，後再漲三四萬，白粳薄稱各做四十五萬，計升七萬元（即期），隔日　白粳四十八萬，薄稻四十九萬。十時半社局以上漲過鉅，即令散市，北市喊價混亂，白粳薄稻喊五十萬，十時即散市，未有正式交易。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日米價再創新紀錄，白粳一度以五十萬元喊出，社局認為米價漲勢驚人，急令糧食市場暫停交易。此時南市以四十三萬四十五萬做開，北市場米商及單幫客本地幫待聞訊後，即趕赴南市場，因此南市場亦高達四十七萬元以上。十時半社局接報後，亦勒令停做交易。今日食米市場能否順利開放，尚待國外物價走勢如何，始可決定。</p>
<p>昨日米市價格混亂異常，白粳約在五十萬元光景，各米號門售則非五十二萬元至五十四萬元莫辨。</p>
<p>又訊：食米市場交易，昨晨社局下令停市後，主管當局市社會局長曹沛滋，曾發表談話，略稱，米市交易每日原以上漲一成為度，如超過此限，即行停做交易。此後糧價當視央行拋金，及無錫產區價格而定。一般正當商人之營業，社局決予維護。假使政府對控制有把握，可能辦理糧食公賣，但尚非一種治本辦法。如果政府有能，出以治本辦法，當可壓制糧價上漲，目前並非糧荒，不過糧價上漲太快，甚為刺激人心而已云云。</p>
<h3>食油麵粉挺升</h3>
<p>食油</p>
<p>價格重趨回漲，因米價升，金價漲，人心甚堅，貨主板價，早市生菜油開二百二十五萬，收市回疲為二百十八萬元，軋漲二十三萬元。豆油收市二百四十萬元，吉桶生油二百五十萬，各漲一成左右。豆餅挺一萬</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>暴漲疾退，起落幅度頗大，初市以圈外激升，股市飛黃騰達，且聞北市米價混亂，人心昂達萬分，兵船晨開猛晉二成餘，一度高做十七萬五千元，後市渡江謠傳頗烈，股市激挫，消息利賣，貨主紛紛脫售，市勢急轉直下。計老車十七萬五千，兵船十六萬七千，紅蜂十七萬，建成十六萬五千元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>全面堅挺，黃豆後市聞央行又拋，金價報挫，油市亦疲，人心轉虛，回挫二萬元，較上日仍軋升二萬元左右。生仁破百萬大關，苞米激跳四成，芝蔴漲二成，紅糧供應仍稀，再漲二成半。</p>
<h3>國行繼續拋售　金價瀕午回小</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市場，價格兔起鶻落，升降倐忽。晨聞因外埠價格不低，人心思高，開盤三九〇萬，一路喊高至三九四萬一千漲停。迄十十時左右，央行委託大德成金號，以三九二萬，拋出六一大條，市勢轉軟。臨收五分鍾，因場外報價回跌，更以銀根緊俏，金號幫紛紛出籠，多頭有三·五十條殺出，步低至三五〇萬收盤。午後央行以三七二萬，三六五萬，一路甩小至三五〇萬。委託大德成金號，繼續大量拋售，但以有央行隔日頭寸，或現鈔為限，致同業無人接受。開盤三五〇萬，中途擯持良久，交易寥寥，終以三五〇萬收盤，較上日軋跌六〇萬。</p>
<p>場外現貨交易，上午開盤三八五萬，三九五萬，中途因各方進胃暢達，一度重出四百萬大關，高至四二〇萬，四三〇萬，瀕午因受央行拋金影響，人心轉定，步低至三七〇萬，三八〇萬收盤。午後交易清稀，隔日交割，喊四四〇萬，四五〇萬。</p>
<p>場外期貨交易，晨開三八五萬，三九五萬，一度曾漲至四四二萬，四四七萬，午收仍低至三八五萬，三九五萬。午後隔日喊價，開盤高達四五〇萬，四六〇萬中途因發行大券之說，浮空爭相抵補一路堅高至四八〇萬，四八五萬，臨收因央行壓力重重，散戶逢高有吐，低至四四五萬，四五〇萬，終以四五〇萬，四五五萬收盤。多空貼息，每兩開六〇萬，差金以四五〇萬結價計算。</p>
<p>飾金</p>
<p>昨日銀樓飾金，瞬息萬變，上午十時掛三八〇萬，四一〇萬，十時半升至三九〇萬，四二〇萬，十一時又高至四一〇萬，四五〇萬，十二時因金價回跌，掛低至三五〇萬，三九〇萬，午後又漲至三七〇萬，四一〇萬，較上日再加十萬，飾銀亦加五千，升至四萬，五萬。錢兌葉掛牌，上午為三七〇萬，三九〇萬，下午低至三五〇萬，三七〇萬。</p>
<p>美鈔</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日美鈔場外因銀元上漲影響，腳地轉堅，各方去化活絡。晨開八萬一，八萬四，曾高至八萬八，九萬三，午收八萬，八萬五。午後因隔日交易，風險頗大，若干字號，均無交易，喊價九萬，九萬五，稍有成交。較上百軋跌三千。</p>
<p>鈔元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元與黃金之比例，證交大樓，對敲字號，開盤自四四，四六，一路低至四三，四五，午後又降至四二，四四收盤。小頭自五三，五八，五二，五七，直低至五〇，五五。中午升至五二，五七。午後一兩黃金換五五塊，有出無進。龍鷹洋自七八，八三，一路小至七五，八〇。午後一兩黃金換七五塊，亦只出勿進。其他大頭對小頭，仍為八〇對一〇〇。大頭對鷹龍洋，亦仍為六〇對一〇〇。美鈔對黃金之比例，為四五，四七，仍在大頭之下。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元套匯續有大量做開，華南，華西，華北三區，套出數量在一百萬枚左右。馬路交易波動劇烈，晨間平定，大頭仍喊八萬二，八萬七。十時左右，因聞內行拋出船洋，價格每枚竟高至九萬，人心又堅。單幫去化旺盛，廠商搜求甚力，一路哄高至九萬三，九萬八，九萬五，十萬。瀕午因金價回落，頭寸緊俏，散戶紛紛出籠，步小至八萬五，九萬。午後供多求少，又低至八萬，八萬五。小頭喊六萬五，七萬。龍鷹洋喊四萬五，五萬。本票交易一度高至九萬七，十萬零二。午後亦降至八萬五，九萬。結果較上日無甚榮辱。</p>
<h3>金管局通令　本票不許貼水</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金管局昨曾通令本市銀錢信託三業公會，對中央銀行所開發之定額本票，因性質上係視同現鈔，故不許再有貼水之現象發生。又對各行莊所開發之本票，按規定係應客戶之請求而開發，亦係見票即付性質，本不應有貼水現象，茲以若干行莊本票發現偽製，馴至行莊收到本票後，亦必須俟提出交換後，方能支付動用，致產生貼水之現象，故該局特令該三業公會在技術上應速謀消除偽造之辦法，傳符行莊開發本票之規定，而自然消　其貼水之現象云。</p>
<h3>國行昨通知銀錢業　不再收購行莊金鈔</h3>
<p>銀根猛緊日拆三百元</p>
<p>國行昨突通知本市銀錢業公會，略以各行莊過去於頭寸未能軋平時，常臨時向國行請求通融收購金銀美鈔或外匯移轉證等，藉渡難關。惟今後國行將不再通融接受是項請求，以免外界物議。銀錢業公會接獲該項電話通知後，昨已緊急通知各會員行莊辦理。按上週一國行拋售大量黃金後，銀根一度劇緊，若干行莊均危殆萬分，迄深夜未能軋平頭寸，紛紛以金銀向國行請求收購，但事後外界指責該行乘機低價收購圖利，故該行決定將停止收購。今後須由行莊自身審慎處理業務，以免不測。自該項措施實行後，昨日銀根大緊，午後每千元日拆高達三百元左右，金融性物品均起瀉跌。</p>
<h3>國行辦金銀　近已陸續運到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行某發言人昨負責向往記者證實，該行確於近日來陸續自美空運黃金數批抵滬，計四月二日，五日，九日各有一批，至運到黃金究有若干，該發言人表示事關機密，未便率直透露。</p>
<p>又該行為平抑銀元價格計，刻正儘量向海外搜購鑄造銀幣所需之原料，現方分頭接洽中。惟數日前已有購就之白銀原料一秕，自海外裝輪運抵滬。惟啓箱之下，始悉全屬澳洲使用硬幣時代所流動之銀元。該項銀元，面積視我國現所流動之銀元略小，惟厚則過之，花紋雕刻殊為美觀。該批銀元，是否即將直接付諸流通，抑另行镕鑄船洋，刻尚未作最後決定，但必將用諸平抑銀元價格之一途云。</p>
<h3>棉紗微見軋升　布市上落狹隘</h3>
<p>昨日紗市微秀，場內交易在銀根緊俏下，未見大量展開，四二支藍鳳由二九〇〇萬元開出，中途直銷淡泊，執戶拉抬無力，價乃步趨軟檔，終以二七〇〇萬元結束，較前仍漲一〇〇萬元。四〇支藍鳳挺一一〇萬元，三二支銀月晨開一七五〇萬元，一度曾哄至一八〇〇萬元，最後漲勢終告不繼，收市反較開盤價為低，以一七〇〇萬元結局，軋升九〇萬元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨，自一三九〇萬一路俏至一四二五萬元為最高，午收為一三一〇萬元，終挺八〇萬元。二〇支雙馬一二三〇萬元，一六支普出一〇〇〇萬大關，一〇支童子軍站住一〇〇〇萬元。</p>
<p>棉布漲勢已戢，因銀根仍屬緊俏，納戶均不願吸進，但握貨者以拆息高昂，成本隨之增加，故脫手亦鮮，場內成效比前為少，市價初漲後平，結果大多仍站住隔日後市之原盤未動。</p>
<p>龍頭細布現貨中途曾做五十一元後，迄收未見做開，棧單午收四十八萬元，現貨約高五千元之譜，五福細布最後四十六萬元，與前無軒輊。</p>
<p>四君子嗶嘰晨開四十八萬四千元，一度漲達四十九萬元，終以四十七萬二千元午收，軋跌二千元，餘布廠盤續見提高。後市初平繼跌，龍頭細布由四十八萬元步挫至四十七萬元收市，四君子嗶嘰初開四十七萬二千元，最後四十六萬二千元，較午收各降一萬二千元。</p>
<h3>銀根雖然抽緊　華股後市仍漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股市況，昨日走勢恍惚，市程暴漲暴落，大戶翻多為空，散戶重入陷阱。晨初聞行局隔夜拋紗拋金等款，昨日大量差進，外埠匯款即將扣壓，銀根緊勢持續，場外空方連續被壓，正伺機反攻，因之謠言熾盛，市勢拉高後猛壓，結果反漲為跌。永紗晨開四六元，場外不斷拉提，升至五〇元〇五角，旋聞央行繼續拋金，財金當局有取締行莊禁止金銀抵押放款之說，暗息高至二三元，而永紗貼息又開高至一元〇五分，一元一角五，巨多散戶紛起了售，檯面空勢俱盛，銀行幫一致猛拋，市勢急瀉，挫至四二元二角，無人問津。旋因逢低有進，頹勢站穩，終又回升至四四元四角午收。</p>
<p>中小型股晨開尚穩，中間漲停紛起，臨收一致帶疲。美亞開高見一元三角五，午收一元一八。新光三元七角三分，小至三元二角午收。景福堅站一元七角，低見一元五角四分午收。勤興二元二角二，跌至二元〇五分。信和以漲限開盤，午收仍堅。其餘雜股，開後多種漲停，臨收仍挺。</p>
<p>午後初因銀根極度抽緊，各股均以低盤開做，但前市被壓，各幫反動甚烈，檯面爭相哄托，市勢激盪相搏，上落仍巨。永紗初做四六元，一度低游至四五元，最後大戶力托，升至五三元三角漲限。申請了結。交易初做四二元，旋退至四〇元，嗣即升至五〇元〇五角，最後仍回至四八元收市。登漲限者計有美亞一元三角六，景福一元七五，台糖十萬〇一千六百元，中火二元七角四，華瓷一元三角七，新華一元八七，中法九元九角五，商務一〇元〇八角，閘北七元八角七，國貨七角。成交四八億四千六百四五萬股。</p>
<h3>法幣公債清償期限　特准延至四月底止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據國行國庫局息：關於法幣公債分級加倍提前清債一案，前經財政部規定限期一月辦理完竣，已於二月十一日起，按照分組加倍標準提前清債，於三月十日辦理結束。茲仍有一部份持票人未及具領，申請通融付給，財政部為免持票人有所損失起見，特自即日起，展期至四月底止，予以補辦。該局昨已通知各地經理行局，及該行各分行處，自十四日起至四月底止，補辦清償手續，希尚未清償之法幣公債持票人速即前往各行局補辦領取手續云。</p>
<h3>市場散步</h3>
<p>— 看台客</p>
<p>央行避免趁火打劫　行莊卻又恐怖起來</p>
<p>昨央行發出通知，告銀錢業道：「今後央行不再接受各行莊請求，收受行莊金銀美鈔，供給現鈔，藉抵頭寸，因過去實行此種通融辦法時，反遭外界物議：謂為央行低價收購，乘機大獲暴利。故不再採行此項通融辦法，以免再招物議」云云。</p>
<p>口氣委曲之至，手段卻也酷辣之至。</p>
<p>央行想起來，我　工作，照市收購金鈔，原義讓各行莊可以過門。你們利用客戶存款，賺取金鈔暴利，才有頭寸軋不攏之事。我給你過門，原是幫你們的忙。不料你們反以怨報德，我何苦徒招物議呢？</p>
<p>然而，在各行莊看起來，央行此舉，簡直故意和行莊為難了。行莊收了存款，要付利息。買賣金鈔，財政部開放在前，又恢復　金市場於後。行莊不買金鈔，存息自何而來？銀根一時告緊，割售金鈔抵頭寸；已經狼狽不堪。中央銀行，原是銀行之銀行。供應頭寸，是責無旁貸的。殺價收進，無異趁火打刦。究非央行應有的態度。現在不圖改良態度，反而根本不負救濟責任，此後竟欲坐視行莊因軋不攏頭寸而倒閉，不能不說央行的手段酷辣了。</p>
<p>以我們看台上的看台客來看：雙方意見，各有是處，也各有不是處。</p>
<p>（一）行莊利用客戶存款，買金鈔賺錢。過不得門時，有央行出任救濟。可見央行的此種「救濟」，等於鼓勵行莊做金鈔投機；早就應該停止這種「救濟」。今之停止，不能不說是一種覺悟。</p>
<p>（二）行莊收了存款，每千元要付日息十五元。雖則每千元放款日息至少六十元，可賺四十五元之多。但物價如此大，開銷如此巨；當局既准許買賣金鈔，而買賣金鈔利益又極厚。因此而發生周轉不靈，央行竟不願收受金鈔，似欠公道。</p>
<p>其實，論是非，多餘的。籌善後，倒是要緊的。我倒有幾個意見貢獻貢獻。</p>
<p>（一）今後央行應先充分供應大鈔，首先消滅各行莊發行本票的流弊。因為濫發本票，就有本票同時回籠的危險。搖撼金融者，這也是當前的一個潛在原因。當然，這個原因，一般行莊是不承認的。</p>
<p>（二）今後，央行應降低利息，放棄現行的高利息政策。這於物價方面，有利無弊的。尤其在目前的狀態中，高利政策是極笨的。</p>
<p>（三）今後大行莊，倒可替代央行獲取暴利的地位。只要把營業時間，延遲到每日下午八時就好了。如有同業要掉頭寸，有頭寸的大行莊，樂得充分收受金鈔賺筆錢。</p>

<h3>回力華聯先後逞能　市長盃籃球前奏曲　兩場友戰精彩紛呈</h3>
<p>（本　　）市長杯籃球賽開幕在即，昨晚市體育館斯路雄師，作試探性之前奏曲，球迷三千，人聲熱鬧。（一）回力勝仁餘，五十一比三十九，上半時五比　六，仁餘多一分。（二）華聯勝利麥令斯，五三比四八，上半時　三十比十八。開場球都相當緊張，頗具緊張，頗具刺激力量。</p>
<p>仁餘投籃，老是不中，表演鬆弛，上半時勉強勝一分。回力B隊主將尚崇獄獨獲　一分，有青出於藍的姿態。曹志吉田福海二人威風依舊，回力會兩度領前十四分，士氣頗旺。後備軍充足，尤為昨晚致勝之一大原因。</p>
<p>麥令斯出場者為代替第九聯隊的第三聯隊，前鋒　　許，海兒斯，凱雄三人，兇猛可畏，加以第九聯隊的萊姆山，上半場打來有聲有色，其中華爾許尤為出色，全部　　家姿態。會與　華聯拼成各七各十一兩度平手。惜乎守衛太鬆，華聯得籃下球之優勢，於是逐漸佔得上風。加以華聯劉福善包松園與成意笛投籃之順，麥令的守衛，終於衝破，上半時卅比十八分。下半時華聯輕車熟路，麥令力追會迫成五六分之距離，但因為陣勢混亂，仍告敗北，最後比數差五分。兩場比賽戰情如次：</p>
<p>回力仁餘戰之</p>
<p>第一場仁餘對回力，仁餘五將為徐仲已，孫國政，吳新運，李榮和，莊逸榮。回力為曹志吉，田福海，魏　，葉雲山，陳正淼。</p>

<p>華聯麥令之役</p>
<p>華聯對麥令斯，　之出場，華聯出場五將　劉福海李震中包松圓傅金聲吳成章。老包出手即三分，堂聲四起，麥令海克好容易投中一球，福善又建功，成章再中，忽見麥令威爾斯海克等活躍，各七平手。小樂代福善，雙方成拉鋸狀態，包罰中，十一平手。刺花黨（麥令隊員大都臂刺花紋）左右逢源，十四比十一，華聯加油，樂吳雙管齊下，始以十五比十四追出。良雄替震中，華聯包胡樂三人猖獗，使麥令斯毫無還價，上半時卅比十八。</p>
<p>休息後，華聯李震中重作馮婦，調出傅金聲，劉福善替出吳成章，麥令斯未有變動。接觸後，樂嘉洲籃下竟未命中，麥令斯乘機攻襲，凱雄一托，福善還進，松圓二度梅開，惠爾斯依樣葫蘆，以後雙方爭戰激烈，精彩非凡，而犯規亦層出不窮。萊姆山遠射中的，吳成章　入，替出松圓，華聯投籃帶掠藍而過。惠爾斯二度偷襲，追成卅四對四一，震中遠射，惠爾斯萊姆山雙管齊下，華聯叫停。傅金聲入替張良雄，安納斯犯規，嘉洲二罰具中，福善錦上添花，華聯分數又告上升。麥令斯叫停，海克　出安納斯，福善籃下拖入，麥令斯力追，怎奈時間已迫眉捷，努力反攻，鐘聲已起，結果四八對五三，以五分之差，敗以華聯。</p>

<h3>南市民主盃足球賽　磐隊大夏各一談和　美中不足動作粗線條</h3>
<p>昨日大夏與磐隊之民主盃足球賽，結果為一比一，未分勝負。大夏開球先攻，不數分鐘即由金錫祺射入一球。下半時相持二十分鐘，磐隊歐惠祖還敬一球，成各一平手。俄頃郁黎申禁區犯規被判十二碼，郁不服，并辱駡裁判，司徒厚主罰，為息事寧人計，故意斜射野逸，是賽粗線條動作甚多，尤其鹿美雄與徐同華之敵對行為，殊　不當，裁判員為沖談火藥氣味，將二人一　罰出。</p>

<h3>女子籃球術</h3>
<p>— 戚公譯述</p>
<p>（B）指導固定式之打法。（一）固定式之打法在下列情況下可以重用。</p>
<p>（甲）從中鋒發動攻勢時。（乙）從界外擲球入場時。但須要夠速度為最要緊，能夠運兩種純然的固定陣式輪流已足夠對付對方之防禦陣。</p>
<p>（按）在男子規則之打法，固定陣式可偶爾採用而不可過於多用，但在女子規則之打法頗為適用，誠如安徒遜氏所述，能純然地練熟兩種方式足以增強攻勢，這種打法必須要每一位球員對於他的任務必然清楚純熟，與每位球員應曉得何時動作，配合全場球員之動作，向一個目標去行動，其利處可以擊破對方之緊逼防禦制，在中國擲球和在界外擲球入場時可以藉煙幕之掩護來實施，其弊處在被對方守衛者看出後，可以迅即改用區域防禦來擊破固定陣式的。</p>
<p>（二）使比賽時能收良效之要點。（甲）須要有充份之熟練。（乙）傳遞與動作時須在時間上有適合之調節。（丙）使球員適當地發揮她的智能。（丁）充份地運用和支配暗號和手勢。</p>
<p>（三）從中國發動攻勢以破人釘人防禦之建議。</p>
<p>（甲）接球者應去趨前接中鋒所傳出之球。（一）前鋒從籃底之尖角處向中綫奔跑出來。（二）前鋒從籃底尖角處交叉斜過球場向中綫奔跑。（三）前鋒作（之）字形向中綫奔跑，並作斜綫前進或退守地切入。</p>
<p>（乙）基本的趨向接球方式之變化。</p>
<p>（一）球員開始作位置之移動時，——或分為散兵式，或齊頭並進，或魚貫跟隨著在前及在後前進，——其位置在球場後方，中段或邊線。（二）方向。——前進交叉切入之斜綫路綫應採用交叉有如英文數字（８）字陣式，其他前鋒衝進時亦須用相反之切入。（三）時間上之調節——前鋒發動攻勢時可採緩攻法藉以誘騙對方之守衛離開防地，但必須能夠立即增加速度，在這種情況下，最好是一位前鋒推進時要有高速度，另一位前鋒則作緩步。</p>
<p>（丙）將球造成射籃之位置。（一）在甲段所敘述之基本趨前接球方式，可循著於各所述之躍高搶奪空中球及籃下球。剛示白衣之十五號球員跳得過早，一足已著地板上，故球終被穿藍衣之球員搶得，看其變手之位置，便可瞭然，此乃在跳躍時與時間調節之結果方式向某方作假動作就突然翻身衝進做成射籃之位置。（二）三位前鋒可分作三條直綫向籃底衝進，由一位前鋒或兩翼鋒繞著向籃底切入接著中鋒之傳遞而造成射　之位置。（三）中鋒可將球傳遞予兩翼，然後跟著球而繞著向前面進。（四）作英文數（8）字式自己之交叉切入做成射籃位置。（五）藉煙幕之掩護而造成射籃機會。例如：（甲）藉　單之煙幕使前鋒　入無入看管而得著射籃之機會。（乙）藉煙幕作連續之傳遞入籃底</p>
<p>結論。上述之各項方法用以進攻人釘人防禦制，會收良效。採用英文數碼之（8）字交叉切入進攻陣式及各種煙幕擋往往獲得成功。</p>
<p>須知球員個人在各種基本之技巧要熟練到夠機巧，和徹底地明瞭練球之攻守理論，加上機智來把握著所獲得之射籃機會才可以攻破一對精於移動區域的隊伍。（完）</p>

<p>籃球甲二　最後兩仗</p>
<p>籃球甲二組今日為分部戰程之最後一日，共計兩場，自下午五時半起仍在市體育館舉行，首仗A組東華對西青藍，裁判愈菊　，陳頌良。次幕D組汕隊遇海豚，由陳寶琳吳事詩　執法。第二場對於首席各位關係至為重要，必有　門。門票照舊，樓上二千五百元，樓下五千元，場內對號八千元。</p>
<p>東華與西青藍之戰，東華常勝不敗，　該組首席已不成問題，即使今日敗於西青藍，與　勛同戰績，但　勛之得失球總分不及東華故也。況東華麾下健將如雲，蔡演雄張邦倫賈幼良李　等如生龍活虎，矯捷非凡，西青諸小番當難與匹敵，但番將屆時頑抗亦所不免也</p>
<p>次幕汕隊對海豚之役，對於首席前途關係重大，按該組浦水以四勝一負暫居第一位，汕隊與海豚同以三勝一負緊隨，今晚汕隊勝海豚，則汕隊可得第一位。海豚勝汕隊，則浦水將　首席。海豚本身雖無第一之望，但第二位之出入，以及分等總決之編列，其升沉亦在此一戰也。</p>
<p>華東——西青藍（甲二A）五時半</p>
<p>汕隊——海豚（甲二D）六時半</p>

<h3>談道德標凖</h3>
<p>— 王重敏</p>
<p>今日的社會所以這樣杭隉不安，一方面固由於社會本身患着相當嚴重的病症，另一方面，却不能不說是由於一般人缺乏正確的道德觀念所致。大部份人，都站在自己利益的立塲來衡量道德，凡對自己有利的，都認為是道德，否則便是不道德。因此，當自己感到不能生存的時候，用一種損人的手段來達成自己求生的欲望，在他們心目中該是很合理的道德邏輯。另一種人，正和上述的相反，他們的道德觀帶有濃厚的宗敎性，認為忍耐寬容，不與人爭纔是道德的基本精神。耶穌不是這樣說過嗎？別人打你的左臉，最好把右臉也送給他打。像這樣的一種犧牲精神，他們覺得才是道德的高度表現。</p>
<p>今日的社會，差不多便被這兩種歪曲的道德觀所支配着。</p>
<p>對於第一種人，我們很容易指出他們對于道德觀念的錯誤。因為求生固是很自然和迫切的要求，但是用不合理的手段去剝奪他人生存的權利，作為換取自己求生的代價，無論如何，這種道德論是難以自圓其說的。</p>
<p>再談第二種人，他們之所以「把右臉送給敵人打」，決不是眞心願意使自己的皮肉受痛苦，而是由於一般人都抱有「吃虧就是便宜」的謬誤心理所致。因為他們以為，打人的人遲早總有一大會被人家打，再不然就是到了「閻王」那裏，也是要受到報應的。這樣一想，眞吃虧的似乎並不是自己而是敵人了，心裏也就不免處之泰然，而帶有一種阿Q式的喜悅。由此可見，這般人絕對不是眞的願意被打和吃虧，他們的最後目的，還是想佔便宜的。他們「把右臉送給敵人」的緣故，祗是想達到將來佔便宜的目的底一種手段而已。</p>
<p>現在我們認淸了，利益—佔便宜—是大衆共同的要求，不論是殺人的魔王，或是虔誠的敎徒，他們莫不是直接或間接地想走上「佔便宜」的道路。「佔便宜」旣為人人所共求，自然便是一種眞理，也便是一種道德。相反地，「吃虧就是便宜」這句話是違背了眞理，也違背了道德的。吃虧決不是道德，忍耐也決不是什麼美德。因為眞正的道德，決不是敎人去吃虧和忍耐，而是敎人怎樣去佔便宜和奮鬥。可是，如果我們一旦違背了人性，用殘酷的手段去攫奪和剝削他人的生命和財產，作為自己生存和享用的資本，則我們又將陷入罪惡和不道德的泥淖。正確的道德觀念，在於怎樣運用自己的智慧和力量，去發掘新的泉源，創造新的環境，在不妨礙他人利益的原則下，合理地去爭取自己的幸福和利益。</p>
<h3>「袁世凱論」</h3>
<p>— 貝貝</p>
<p>歷史課中，先生出了一個題目：「袁世凱論」。</p>
<p>某生，沉思良久，揮毫書曰</p>
<p>「根據最近考據，世凱實姓「圓」，生於「中華民國三年」，為民國史上一「巨頭」人物，相貌威武非凡，面部容光煥發，兩”炯炯有神，惟時或半開半閉，作沉思狀，酷似一代思想大家。民國廿四年，氏因疾而終，然死後陰瓊不散，時在人間顯靈。至今，小民更多在夢寐中見之。</p>
<p>前些時候，史家不察，對「圓」氏時加抨擊；但及至最近，已少有非難「圓」氏其人者。相反的，男女小民，尤其公敎人員，多把他奉為「救星」，論其身價，竟已超過美國先賢「華盛頓」與「林肯」矣。</p>
<p>查民國歷史人物中，至今仍能深受廣大羣眾愛戴者，實以「圓」氏不爲第一人。事實俱在，非有意阿諛捧場也」云云。</p>
<p>西洋幽默</p>
<p>— 以是</p>
<p>乞丐跟在一個衣冠楚楚的紳士後面，要討錢買東西吃。</p>
<p>「我給你買杯酒吃好嗎！」紳士向乞丐說。</p>
<p>「我不喝酒，請你祗給我錢，去買些東西吃」。</p>
<p>紳士從袋中摸出一支雪茄烟給乞丐：「拿支雪茄去吃吧！」</p>
<p>「謝謝你，先生」。這乞丐哀求道：「請你給我五毛錢，我祗想買點吃的充饑。」</p>
<p>「好」，紳士最後說：「我就給你五毛錢，但是你要跟我一起回家，我要給我的太太看！一個不喝酒，不吸烟的人，是這副個子的！」</p>
<h3>五指山述異</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>日前有個新從海南島遊歷歸來的友人來訪，閒談中說起海南島五指山的奇物異景，以及山中生黎的奇習怪俗，不由我聽得津津有味，疑信參半，恍惚間看到了有如「人猿泰山」中的鏡頭。</p>
<p>據友人說：五指山中叢莾遍野，草長沒人，猛獸毒蛇匿跡其間。除了有村落的地方外，人們赤手空拳是不敢遊歷的；而且在深山中，還長着聞所朱聞的奇怪植物，例如龍爪藤，長達數十丈，藤上有爪，狀如龍爪，故名。動物若碰到藤爪，就會被藤捲住，捲力極大，無論動物的氣力多强，也難掙脫出來，直到血被藤吸盡時，藤爪方才重新伸展開來。又有一種猪籠草，狀如猪籠，上生籠蓋，若動物失足落入籠中，籠蓋便立卽闔上，而將動物活活悶死。</p>
<p>朋友說，龍爪藤他沒看到過，但猪龍草郤親眼看到過。他說，猪籠草直徑大的約有一呎餘，小動物常有被它殺害的危險。</p>
<p>生活在五指山中的生黎約有數十萬人。生黎膚色帶亦褐色，牙齒大半墨黑，這是由於山中多檳榔，生黎常食此果，檳榔汁能使齒色變黑的緣故。</p>
<p>生黎男女都蓄髮髻，女的則在髻上插化作為裝飾。男的上身大半赤裸，下着布褲。而最奇怪的是：年輕女郎一律面描花紋，黑晴中遇見，有如夜叉，令人胆寒，但黎民却認為這是「美」，因此愈美麗的黎女，臉上的花紋愈多，愈複雜。有時，頸上還掛着一些獸骨作為裝飾品。</p>
<p>由於野性未除，生黎的性情極為暴躁，動輒動武殺人。不過，至今已有百分之七十的黎民已被漢人同化了，他們有的已知耕種和行商，有的則仍以狩獵為生。</p>
<p>疾病是黎民的一大威脅。他們沒有醫藥，只知祈求鬼神驅病。在他們的腦中，「病鬼」常附身在女人身上，因此當有人生病垂死時，富有的黎民便請巫婆作法驅鬼，巫婆召集狪（黎民的村名）中所有的女人，口中喃喃有詞，順手指着一個女人，這個女人便是「病鬼」了，於是一大羣人將她打過半死，直到巫婆發令止打，她方能帶傷回家。有的竟因此而白自死亡。</p>
<h3>重點敎育的試騐</h3>
<p>— 道先</p>
<p>美國的敎育事業，年耗數十億元，而其結果仍多不如人意。現代學校中的兒童，對於數學和英語的知識，竟及不上他們祖父在學熟中的成績。敎育當局雖於增加敎師待遇及擴充學校設備等方面多所努力，但對於這一個事實，却仍少注意及之。</p>
<p>但有兩個機構，却注意到這一點。一是奧海奧州的「西拉姆學院」，另一是賓夕凡尼亞州「基斯凱男童學校」。</p>
<p>這兩個學校的敎育制度，是極簡單的。就是：在一個時期內只學一樣課程。例如，在某兩個月，學生單學西班牙文，其他都不學；在另兩個月中，專學代數。集中一點，專心學習。這種制度，和二次大戰中陸軍部辦的「專門技能訓練課程」相似，收效宏大。</p>
<p>試看現在的學校中，學生們上個鐘點念英文，下個鐘點上代數，接着又是生物和歷史。而敎師們又互無聯絡，都各自指派了一批家庭作業。學生們或是被壓得透不過氣來，或是乾脆一槪不理。</p>
<p>我們再談一下上述的「基斯凱學校」。該校校長是克拉克博士，他仔細研究，發覺一般學生十個中有九個對所讚的功課毫無興趣。學生為了應付功課，不得不苦讀若干時間，但事實上他們並不喜歡。</p>
<p>是否可以設法使學生們愛好功課呢？克拉克博士不斷地研究了好幾個月，最後他就想到實施「重點敎育」的辦法，於一九四四年秋季開始。</p>
<p>他把一年劃成四學期，每學期九屋期，春天有一個覆習期。這樣，每個學生一年只讀四種課程，四年以後，足可考入大學。</p>
<p>這種敎育方法實騐的結果，頗見功効。去年畢業時，僅有四個學生因成績不佳淘汰。在以往，畢業班總要有十二到十五個學生被淘汰。學生的一般平均成績，都增加十分左右。在大學入學考試中，第一流學府的錄取標凖是四百分到五百分之間。六十三名基斯凱畢業生參加數學考試，只有六個人在四百分以下。</p>
<p>這種新的敎育制度，是否會使學生們感到疲倦呢？在學生中調查的結果，證明並不然。學生只要專心在課堂中學習，回家就用不到再溫書。而且學生們感到，他是確實在學一樣功課，並非僅是趕完一學期的課程。有人問：學生們是否會感到缺少變化呢？其實，學生們上了一堂英文，再換一堂三角，也一點不會感到什麼變換的趣味的。</p>
<p>西拉姆學校的校長飽爾費博士親：這種敎育制度，並沒有解決一切的敎育問題。但無論如何，它可以使聰明或愚鈍的學生，同樣得到發展智力的機會。它並且敎導學生如何依次解決問題，這對於他們將來踏入社會做事時，是一種極寳貴的訓練</p>
<p>這個辦法，中國的教育家不知有意嘗試一下否？</p>

<h3>Peace Talks Enter Formal Stage; Huang Shao-hong Returns to Nanjing Today with Report; Provides Government with Future Course of Action; Rumors of CCP Sending Personnel to Nanjing for Liaison Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The last news broadcast by the CCP’s Beiping Radio at 10:30 PM on the 13th read as follows: “The negotiations between the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party and the delegation of the Nanjing Kuomintang government, regarding the eight-point basic peace conditions, have lasted twelve days. During these twelve days, both sides have informally exchanged views on various issues. Starting from today (the 13th), we enter the formal negotiation stage.”</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Preliminary consultations on peace talks have made considerable progress. Authoritative sources observe that, based on the current situation, the peace talks may reach a conclusion before the end of this month. The conclusion mentioned by this source includes both success and failure.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Huang Shao-hong, the government's peace talk representative, will return to Nanjing from Beiping on the 14th, carrying the delegation's complete report. The content of this report is the preliminary conclusion of the talks in Beiping and will serve as the official basis for future negotiations. It is extremely confidential and important. Due to the difficulty of telecommunications between Beiping and Nanjing, Mr. Huang is personally carrying it back and will provide explanations.</p>
<p>Qu Wu, an advisor to the delegation, will also return to Nanjing on the same flight. All information regarding the various negotiation processes in Beiping will also be brought back by Huang Shao-hong on the 14th. The capital's officials are awaiting this information to determine future steps.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] He Yingqin presented a report on the peace talks issue during the political affairs meeting on the 13th, stating that the government delegation had been in Beiping for over ten days, but formal meetings had not yet begun. However, pre-meeting consultations had come to an end, and Huang Shao-hong would return to Nanjing to report on the entire process within days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Liu Zhongrong carried several sets of reference materials prepared by the government on the special plane to Beiping on the 12th. The government delegation spent the entire day of the 13th studying them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] It is rumored here that the CCP will also send personnel to Nanjing to be responsible for liaison and contact, but individuals close to Acting President Li have not confirmed this.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Changes Departure to Beiping to the 15th to Meet Huang Shao-hong and Exchange Opinions; Entourage May Increase to Ten; Acting President Li and Premier He Politely Decline Third-Party Invitation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Yu Youren's departure to Beiping has been delayed by one day to await the return of government representative Huang Shao-hong to Nanjing, to meet with him and exchange opinions before departing on the 15th. Mr. Yu's trip will be very short, reportedly staying in Beiping for about a week. According to reliable sources, Mr. Yu's trip to Beiping is in response to an invitation from third-party figures.

<h3>Mr. Yu Informs Control Yuan Supervisors That His Trip North Is in a Private Capacity</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Control Yuan held a closed-door discussion meeting in Nanjing at 3:30 PM on the 13th. Over sixty supervisors attended. Vice President Liu Zhe, who was in Shanghai, and over twenty supervisors arrived in Nanjing on the 13th to participate. During the meeting, President Yu reported on the progress of the peace talks and his invited trip to Beiping. Mr. Yu specifically stated that his trip to Beiping was in response to an invitation from friends and was in a private capacity. He was not representing the government, the Control Yuan, or the Kuomintang. Although the future of the peace talks is not without difficulties, he is willing to travel to Beiping at the urging of all parties to assist and facilitate. The Control Yuan colleagues who were invited to travel with him were also going in a private capacity and did not represent the Control Yuan. When discussing his views on the peace talks, Mr. Yu adopted a cautiously optimistic attitude, saying that more effort was needed. After Mr. Yu finished his report, Liang Shangdong stood up to speak, believing that Mr. Yu was not only a veteran of the Kuomintang but also a veteran of the country. He hoped that Mr. Yu could successfully complete his mission in Beiping.</p>

This proved that sincerity can move even metal and stone. As long as one seeks it sincerely, no matter how difficult and arduous, one will surely be able to overcome it.

<h3>Issue of Renewing Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Discussion Did Not Reach Conclusion</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The issue of renewing the Sino-Soviet aviation agreement was submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 13th. The Soviet side intends to renew it, requesting a validity period of twenty years. After detailed research by the political committee members, which took a long time, no conclusion was reached.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Affairs and Budget Committees Jointly Review Financial Bills; Differing Opinions Among Committee Members Did Not Reach Conclusion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The amended financial reform bill submitted by the Executive Yuan for review was submitted for review by the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Affairs Committee and Budget Committee at a joint meeting on the 13th. Zhu Huiqing's proposal to request the government to drastically change its financial measures and Qiu Hanping's proposal to implement a silver standard and issue banknotes were also discussed together. Zhang Jingyu chaired the meeting, and Finance Minister Liu Gongyun attended to report on the differences between the amended bill and the original bill, explaining them one by one. Then, the committee members expressed their opinions and raised questions. Li Yunliang advocated for stipulating a gold unit as a unified value standard, saying that silver dollars should not be used as a unified value calculation standard because the number of silver dollars is too small, they are not widely used, and they are easily targeted for panic buying, causing drastic price fluctuations. He advocated imitating the pre-war customs gold unit system, that is, expanding the scope of the current customs gold unit system, stipulating that one gold unit is equal to forty US cents or a certain amount of gold. This gold unit is only for the value calculation standard and does not issue banknotes or coins. The exchange rate between each gold unit and gold yuan coupons is posted daily by central banks in various places as the standard for actual payment. The budgets of all levels of government, various taxes, the rates of various transportation and public utilities, various prices, various salary compensation (including the salaries of civil servants and soldiers), various deposits, discounting loans, and other calculations related to exchange value are all calculated according to the gold unit. The ratio of banks to gold units is also posted daily by the central bank. "Silver dollars," "customs gold units," and "tax dollars" can all be converted into gold units. Other relevant articles, such as production loans and value-preserved deposits, all use the gold unit as a unified unit of calculation. Zhu Huiqing agreed with Li's opinion and believed that the government had failed to grasp the use of the monetary standard, using silver dollars and gold on the one hand and issuing gold yuan coupons on the other, which accelerated the collapse of gold yuan coupons. Implementing the bank standard system can only encourage imports and stifle exports. Liu Shijian questioned whether the policy of selling gold could be maintained for a long time. Does the Ministry of Finance have confidence? Bao Huaguo advocated that the government should come up with capital and stop plundering the big families. If one hundred million in foreign exchange can be used to improve the treatment of soldiers and public servants and stabilize the currency value, then military and political conditions will surely change for the better in two or three months, and tax revenue will also be improved. Wu Gan questioned four points: (1) Song Ziwen went to Taiwan, reportedly to improve the Taiwan dollar. Does he want to use the country's gold? (2) If remote provinces establish their own currency systems independently, does the Ministry of Finance have a way to stop them? (3) When can the property tax be prepared? (4) Why not use the method of allocating public bonds to balance finances? Liu Quanzhong believed that the amendment was just a method of increasing taxes, but if there is no better method, it can be considered for implementation, and he also advocated issuing public bonds and using the gold standard calculation method. The meeting continued in the afternoon. First, Li Yunliang's proposed amendments to the bill were discussed item by item. The committee members spoke enthusiastically, and the opinions were summarized into four points: (1) Adopting a unified calculation standard unit; (2) Using customs gold units for paying customs duties and other taxes; (3) Using tax dollars as the standard unit for all taxation; (4) Using the price index as the calculation standard. Finally, when the above four opinions were put to a vote, the committee members had differing opinions, causing a heated debate. No conclusion was reached until 6 PM in the afternoon, and it was decided to submit this case to the next meeting of the Executive Yuan for discussion.

<h3>Navy Exerts Power; Continues to Create Brilliant Battle Lines; Recovers Datuan Mountain on the North Bank of Central Anhui</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Wuhu Dispatch, 13th] In the battle to defend the Jiangbei bridgehead, the Navy has recently exerted unparalleled power and established new achievements after the Anqing campaign. Since the 7th, the 79th and 2nd Corps of the Communist army under Chen Yi have continued to attack the bridgehead positions in Tuqiao, Yuxikou, Ji Temple (north bank of Wuhu), Xixishan, Huayang, and other places in Jiangbei, Central Anhui. Among them, the fighting was initially the fiercest in the Xiliang Mountain area. On the 9th, the fighting also reached its climax. Relying on the Navy's intense fire network of firing 3,000 rounds per hour, the attacking Communist army was completely repelled in coordination with the army. Datuan Mountain, the forward position of Xiliang Mountain that was once captured by the Communist army on the 9th, was also completely recovered on the morning of the 13th. It is reported that the Communist army, unable to overcome the repeated attacks, abandoned Xiliang Mountain starting on the night of the 12th and shifted its focus to the Yuxikou and Ji Temple areas across the river from Wuhu as the main points of attack. By noon, they had also been completely repelled by the National Army in coordination with the Navy, Army, and Air Force. According to the statistics of the Navy's Jiangfang Fleet, the Communist army suffered over 3,000 casualties when attacking Tuqiao, over 6,000 in Xiliang Mountain, over 3,000 in Ji Temple, over 2,000 in Huayang, and over 8,000 in Yuxikou, totaling over 20,000 people. Over 300 people surrendered and were captured. The 30th Army belonging to its 7th Corps was almost completely annihilated.</p>
<h3>Has the CCP Issued an Order to Stop Attacking? Intense Battles Widespread on Jiangbei Front; Communist Army Attempting to Cross the River at Various Places Repelled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] According to reliable sources, the CCP Central Committee, at the request of the government representatives, ordered the front-line Communist army to stop attacking on the 10th. However, because the front-line Communist army continued to attack, the government representatives reported this matter to the CCP representative Zhou Enlai. The CCP then re-ordered the front-line Communist army to stop attacking through Mao Zedong. However, according to military officials who spoke to reporters, there were still battles on some bridgehead positions on the Jiangbei front on the morning of the 13th, especially in Yuxikou and its surrounding areas across the river from Wuhu. The Communist army's offensive abated slightly starting in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Another official source claimed on the 13th that Gu Zhutong, Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, confirmed that the CCP's order to stop attacking had been issued, based on the Communist army's withdrawal action. As for the fact that some areas are still under attack, it may be due to inconvenient transportation and the order not being able to reach them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] There were still battles on the Jiangbei front from the night of the 12th to the morning of the 13th, especially in Gaoqiao (opposite Dagang east of Zhenjiang), Yongan Island (sandbar in the river south of Longwo in Kouan), Hejiadagang (north of Yangzhou), and Yuxikou and Zhonglugang (opposite Wuhu). (1) In the Gaoqiao area, the Communist army took advantage of the narrow river surface, which is only three li away from Dagang on the south bank. On the night of the 12th, they attempted to cross the river with over 3,000 Communist troops in over a hundred boats of various types. To eliminate the threat to Zhenjiang and the central section of the Nanjing-Shanghai line, the National Army, under the personal planning and deployment of Generals Tang Enbo and Gui Yongqing, and with the coordination of the Air Force, launched a full-scale counterattack against the Communist army from 5:00 AM on the 13th. After a fierce battle until about 9:30 AM, the attacking Communist army was completely defeated. In addition to completely recovering the key points of Gaoqiao and its nearby Xin Island and Lotus Pond, the reconstruction of the bridgehead on the north bank was completed on the same day. (2) In the Yongan Island area, on the night of the 12th, the Communist army also used over a hundred boats of various types to sneak across to Yongan Island in the river from Longwo in Kouan. Before the morning of the 13th, they were completely repelled by the National Army, killing and wounding over 600 Communist troops and sinking over ten boats. (3) In the Hejiadagang area, on the night of the 12th, over thirty wooden boats, fully loaded with Communist troops, attempted to sneak across from Sanjiangying to the vicinity of the port. Six boats were sunk, over 200 Communist troops were killed and wounded, and the remaining boats retreated to Jiangbei. (4) In the Yuxikou and Zhongluxiang areas, the Communist army's attack was also fierce starting at 10 PM on the night of the 12th. By noon on the 13th, they had been completely repelled by the defending troops. In addition, small groups of Communist troops attacked the mountains north of Jiangpu City, the Xianding Bridge in the Flag Camp on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, and the outskirts of Anqing on the night of the 12th, but they were all completely repelled by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Wuhu Dispatch, 13th] On the night of the 12th, over a thousand Communist troops from the Wangjiang Northeast Zhanghe Saikou area opposite Dongliu, took wooden boats to attempt to sneak across to Jiyang between Dadukou and Dongliu, but were repelled by the defending troops on the south bank.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Zhenjiang Dispatch, 13th] Official News: Over two thousand Communist troops from the Gaoqiao area in the center of the river opposite the Dagang area of Zhenjiang. Artillery and a large number of boats were discovered in the Xinzhou area to build a pontoon bridge, attempting to cross the river. They came into contact with the alert troops at about 6:00 AM on the 13th. The Communist troops retreated north at about 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Zhenjiang Dispatch, 13th] It is reported that the main force of the Communist army is now concentrating from Yangzhou towards Taixian and Taixing, with unclear intentions. In addition, the main force of four regiments of the 7th Column of the Communist army is now concentrated in the area around Shijiaqiao on the Yangzhou-Liuhe line.

<h3>The Arrest of Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian: Control Yuan Decides to Conduct Investigation; Rumor That the Garrison Command Will Rearrest Xu Denied</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Regarding the arrest of legislators Jin Shaoxian and Xu Wentian, after a heated debate during the Control Yuan discussion meeting on the afternoon of the 13th, it was decided to appoint members Zhao Xi and Wang Zhenhua to conduct an investigation in order to clarify the facts and then decide how to handle the matter. During the meeting, Liu Pingjiang spoke first, believing that the arrest of Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian by the arresting authorities was unconstitutional and should be thoroughly investigated. Zhang Dinghua shared the same opinion as Liu Pingjiang. Hu Wenhui, based on the provisions of the criminal law regarding offenders caught in the act, believed that according to newspaper reports, Xu's case involved an offender caught in the act, and the arrest was not illegal. If the newspaper reports were inaccurate, an investigation should be conducted, and before clarification, it could not be hastily concluded that the arrest by the authorities was illegal. Subsequently, Liu Xingzhi stood up and criticized the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Command for being unconstitutional. Hu Wenhui stood up again and engaged in a heated debate with him, arguing for a long time. Wang Xiangchen, Gu Fengxiang, Li Zhengle, and others also expressed that an investigation should be conducted first. Finally, it was decided to have Wang Zhenhua and Zhao Xi investigate before deciding on the attitude and steps the Control Yuan should take.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Chen Kewen, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, denied on the evening of the 13th that the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Command had requested the rearrest of legislator Xu Wentian and the detention of six other legislators. According to reports, when the Garrison Command sent Xu Wentian back, it sent a letter to the Executive Yuan to complete the arrest procedures. The letter also included an arrest warrant and requested the Legislative Yuan to detain six other legislators so that they could be sent back to Shanghai for trial along with Xu. Chen stated that this was not the case. He claimed that he had inquired with Huang Shao-gu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, who said that there was no such official letter.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Regarding the arrest of legislators Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian, President He presented a report at the political affairs meeting on the 13th.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 13th] Zhang Shaohua, Director of the Suzhou Water Police Bureau, published a notice in various newspapers on the 13th denying that he had been arrested and that he had participated in a revolutionary alliance organization. He left Suzhou for Zhenjiang on the 13th on official business.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Future of the British Labour Cabinet</h3>
<p>The British county council elections were held throughout the country last week. Although the final results have not yet been announced, according to preliminary vote counts, the Conservative Party has already won 344 seats, while the Labour Party has only won 68 seats. This has forced the Labour Party authorities to admit that they have encountered a serious setback in this election. The Labour Party's official newspaper, "Daily Herald," published a commentary specifically to alert the Labour Party to this failure, saying, "It would be a great mistake to ignore last week's failure." Anyone who deeply understands British party politics believes that the results of the national county council elections serve as a barometer for the next British parliamentary election. Therefore, the British Labour Party, which has been in power for four years, is now facing another serious test.</p>
<p>The British Labour Party has been focusing on domestic socialization construction for the past four years. It cannot be said that it has achieved remarkable success in domestic affairs. In particular, the spirit of hard work of the Labour Party leaders is most worthy of admiration. Although the Labour Party has now suffered a failure in the national county council elections due to other reasons, the Labour Party leaders are still continuing their efforts to try to win back the lost popular support. According to a United Press dispatch from London on the 12th, the National Executive Committee of the British Labour Party has drafted a fighting social reform plan, advocating the intensification of state-owned industries and economic design on a permanent basis. Sugar refining, cement, industrial insurance, meat wholesaling, and local tap water supplies should all be nationalized. In the Labour Party's statement of reasons, it put forward a most beautiful, most novel, and most moving slogan, which is "We will seek freedom from the material constraints and servitude of capitalism." This is indeed a slogan that every British person loves to hear.</p>
<p>However, this plan still needs to be discussed at the Labour Party Congress in June this year and can only be implemented after it is approved by the Congress. Currently, it can only be regarded as a new check from the British Labour Party, and whether it can be cashed in the future is still a question. In fact, even if this plan becomes a reality and makes the lives of the British people more rational and more socialized, it may still be difficult to reverse the Labour Party's downward trend. To be honest, the Labour Party's achievements in domestic affairs during its four years in power are unmatched by any normal cabinet. However, the Labour Party is now suddenly on the decline, and the reason for this lies not in domestic affairs, but in its foreign policy.</p>
<p>On the eve of the 1945 British general election, although World War II had not yet ended, the bloody curtain in Europe had fallen. The Labour Party was already 80 to 90 percent confident of winning the first election after the war and had internally designated Bevin as Foreign Secretary to decide on Britain's new foreign policy. However, Bevin suddenly chanted the slogan of "supra-party line" and his diplomatic actions were almost no different from those of the Conservative Party. He did not sympathize with the Indonesian struggle against the Dutch during the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, but instead supported the Netherlands, which was invading Indonesia. On the Greek issue, he did not support the enlightened and progressive democratic parties, but instead supported the backward Greek royal family. In all the meetings of the United Nations, the British representative had no unique views and completely followed the lead of the American representative. On the German and Japanese issues, Britain also followed the United States. The United States advocated the conclusion of the Atlantic Treaty, and Britain not only did not hesitate but actively tried to woo other countries to participate, and regardless of the people's living burden, put forward a huge financial budget, making every British person feel the threat of "guns before butter." All of this ran counter to the wishes of the British people. What the British people seek today is nothing more than world peace. They see the world situation very clearly and unanimously believe that only in an atmosphere of international peace can Britain overcome its material difficulties and embark on the road to prosperity. Therefore, in the four years since the war, when British Labour Party leaders reported on foreign policy in the House of Commons, they often saw applause from the opposition, while the enlightened members of the Labour Party instead responded with boos. This is truly a strange phenomenon unprecedented in the British Parliament.</p>
<p>The social policies implemented by the British Labour Party not only have lofty ideals but are also the most practical and easy to implement. The socialism implemented by the Soviet government is essentially the same, with no major differences. From this point of view, the improvement of Anglo-Soviet relations is not only easier than with any other country but also the most promising. The world also places high hopes on British Labour Party's diplomacy, hoping that Britain will take a middle ground, act as a bridge between the US and the Soviet Union, and restore the world, which has been divided into two poles, to unity. However, in the four years since then, not only has the "bridge dream" become a thing of the past, but Britain has also regarded the Soviet Union as an enemy. The other day, British Prime Minister Attlee gave a speech, accusing the Soviet Union of being responsible for the division of the world, and said that the Atlantic Treaty was not aggressive but defensive. No matter how Attlee explains it, from the standpoint of the British Labour Party, it is always incompatible with its domestic policy. This is the contradiction between the Labour Party's domestic and foreign policies, and it is also the focus of the Labour Party's loss of faith among voters. Looking ahead to the 1950 general election, the Labour Party's future is very bleak.</p>
<p>However, on today's British party political stage, the Liberal Party has declined and is no longer considered a major player. Only the Labour Party and the Conservative Party are taking turns holding power. Logically speaking, if the British people are disappointed with the Labour Party, they can only choose the Conservative Party. But in reality, can the Conservative Party's domestic and foreign policies be better than those of the Labour Party? The eyes of the British people are discerning. The Labour Party's failure in the national county council elections is not so much a prelude to the Conservative Party's regaining power as it is a warning given to the Labour Party by the British people. If the Labour Party can be particularly vigilant about this and work harder in the future, it is too early to say what the outcome of the 1950 general election will be.</p>

Huang Jianzhong expressed suspicion about the vice-principal system in each school and believed that the work of the Assistance Committee should meet needs. Liu Han believed that the treatment of refugee students and border students should be reasonable. Pan Lianfang advocated handling student unrest in a democratic manner. The Ministry of Education should pay attention to teachers colleges at all levels and did not agree with establishing temporary universities for refugee students, because temporary easily becomes careless. Wang Xinmin expressed support for the dean of students system, but at the beginning of this constitutional era, its reasonable application should be sought to mislead students in a fair and democratic way. Others, such as Niu Xianchu, also spoke. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>

Therefore, the general public attaches great importance to this. Last night, the CCP radio station broadcast the full text of the telegram. The telegram specified that the Soviet youth are extremely concerned about the heroic struggle of the Chinese Communist Party and youth for freedom, democracy, and independence, and expressed "heartfelt respect."

Finally, it expressed the hope that the friendship between Chinese and Soviet youth can be further increased and expanded. It is said that when the CCP Youth League held a meeting yesterday, the presidium read out this congratulatory telegram, and the entire venue responded with warm and continuous applause. The draft charter of the League stipulates that the League affairs are led by the Chinese Communist Party, guided by the proletarian ideological system, and attracts young workers, farmers, and intellectuals as the backbone.</p>

<h3>The Establishment of West Germany is Imminent, Allied Countries Urge Speedy Formulation of a Charter, Assist German Economy to be Self-Sufficient and Decide to Reduce Dismantling of German Industrial Equipment</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bonn, 12th] Liaison officers of the British and American parliamentary committee (constituent assembly) stationed in West Germany urgently notified the meeting today, stating that due to the tightening of the world political situation, the establishment of West Germany is imminent. The notice also blamed German political parties for nitpicking every clause of the draft West German constitution. The constitutional work has come to a standstill since the German Social Democratic Party criticized the content of the draft constitution yesterday as being impossible to implement. German officials here believe that the Western Allies' urging is due to the fear that the Soviet authorities are preparing to lift the Berlin blockade, so that the Western occupying countries have to agree to the four powers to re-discuss the solution to the entire German problem. The Germans also said that since Britain, the United States, and France formed an agreement on West Germany in Washington, the Soviet Union has been actively preparing to take new actions to prevent the establishment of the West German government. Therefore, if the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade, according to the gentleman's agreement in the United Nations Security Council last year, both countries cannot refuse to participate in the four-power discussion to seek a solution to the entire German problem.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bonn, 13th] Responsible officials said today that the United States, Britain, and France are drafting a plan to separate West Berlin and set up its own parliament. This plan is equivalent to establishing a second government in Germany. The West German government will be established within this year, and the East German government plan will also be announced.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The United States, Britain, and France will announce today a reduction in the number of German compensation factories to be dismantled. This is a further step for the Allied countries to help the German economy become self-sufficient. It is reported that the United States initially proposed reducing the number of dismantled factories by 167, and finally agreed with Britain and France to retain 150 to 160 German factories. The list of dismantled factories lists a total of 2,000 wartime factories, and hundreds have been dismantled in the past three years. The proposal to reduce the dismantling of factories was put forward by Hoffman, Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, with the aim of making German industry contribute to European reconstruction. France opposed this proposal most strongly, fearing the revival of the German military industry. The recent establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty has increased France's sense of security, and the main reason for the establishment of the three-country agreement is probably this.</p>
<h3>Indonesia-Netherlands Dispute and the Ming Zhen谛 Case, Included in the Agenda of the United Nations General Assembly, Indian and Pakistani Representatives Fully Support Indonesia</h3>
<p>[United Press, Flushing, 12th] This afternoon, the United Nations General Assembly voted by 41 to 3 to include this 20-month-old Indonesian dispute in the agenda. The Netherlands only received the support of Belgium and South Africa, and 12 countries abstained. According to the United Nations Charter, the General Assembly has the right to discuss this dispute, which concerns the transfer of sovereignty of the East Indies from the Hague government to the Netherlands-Indonesian Federation, including the Republic of Indonesia.</p>
<p>Indian representative Shi David recalled that India initially suggested including the Indonesian issue in the agenda. He emphasized that the people and peace of Asia are related to this. He also said that it should not be easily forgotten that 19 member states of the United Nations met in New Delhi to discuss the Indonesian issue. He said that the United Nations undoubtedly has the right to take action on this matter. He went on to say that the discussion of the General Assembly will help the negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia. (Under the auspices of the Indonesian Commission, the Netherlands-Indonesian talks will begin in Batavia on the 13th.) Pakistani representative Kean declared that although the Security Council has made great efforts to resolve this dispute, the situation in the Republic of Indonesia is deteriorating at the same time. He said, now Indonesia is even recognized as the actual government, why is this? He said, it is because of the continuous military aggression of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 12th] The United Nations General Assembly today approved the inclusion of the trial of Hungarian Cardinal Ming Zhen谛 and 15 Bulgarian clerics in this session of the General Assembly for discussion. Afterwards, United Nations Secretary-General Lai Yi stated that the case can be submitted for discussion after Easter. It is also reported that Hungary and Bulgaria have sent telegrams to protest against the representatives who supported the discussion of the case by the General Assembly, pointing out that this is an unreasonable interference in the internal affairs of Hungary and Bulgaria.</p>
<h3>Netherlands-Indonesia Negotiations Begin Today, Indonesian Representatives Express Pessimism</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 13th Broadcast: Batavia News: Romm, chairman of the Indonesian delegation preparing to participate in the Netherlands-Indonesia talks, told reporters on the eve of the reopening of the Netherlands-Indonesia negotiations: "I am not very optimistic about the preliminary talks to be held tomorrow (14th), but we still need to continue to work hard in order to achieve the goal of a peaceful settlement." Although he warned of the possibility of the situation deteriorating again, he emphasized that he hopes to resolve it quickly.

<h3>閘北警局巡官死難案　捕獲疑犯男女十四名</h3>
<p>Fourteen male and female suspects arrested in the case of the death of an inspector from the Zhabei police station</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] Wang Jie, an inspector at the Zhabei police station, led police patrols in his jurisdiction at 3 AM on the morning of the 8th. On the way, they encountered robbers and were arrested by the robbers. As a result, Inspector Wang was shot in the chest and abdomen, and died on the spot. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Afterwards, in addition to personally attending the funeral, Director Mao ordered all police stations to strictly arrest the robbers who fled the scene and bring them to justice for investigation. It is now known that the branch director of the police station, Zhang, ordered the criminal section chief Jiang Ying to lead all criminal police officers to search and arrest the suspects, and Inspector Wang Shusheng investigated day and night, and went to Suzhou, Pudong and other places to pursue and arrest them. Finally, after days of arrest, fourteen suspects related to the case were arrested, including Xia Yifei, Liang Shouhong, Ma Chonggui, Qiu Rufa, Zhou Zhede, Luo Wenxiang, Qiu Yichen, Gu Jinxiang, Fang Xiaosanzi, Sang Yiyi, Pei Shilai, and women Bian Mao, Tao Zhu, and Tang Xue. Four box guns and one handgun were confiscated. Due to the serious suspicion, they are being rigorously investigated. An application for extension of detention was submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday morning, and they will be transferred to the Garrison Command for investigation after the investigation is completed.</p>
<h3>市府平衡財政收支　計劃大綱擬訂完成　整理舊稅決定四項原則</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government's outline of the plan to balance financial revenue and expenditure is completed; four principles are determined for organizing old taxes</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] After Secretary-General Chen of the Municipal Government took office, he faced the most difficult financial crisis in the city. Therefore, he paid special attention to financial issues. In addition to personally handling financial cases day and night, he also instructed the Finance Bureau to quickly draft measures to raise funds for the city to provide for expenditures. After receiving the order, the Finance Bureau did not abandon the drafting of these measures despite the tense situation of continuously raising funds and cash. It recently completed a detailed "Outline of the Plan to Balance Financial Revenue and Expenditure in This City." Yesterday morning at 9 AM, it convened relevant agencies such as the Land Administration Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, the Accounting Office, and the Municipal Bank to discuss it together. Regarding the "organization of old taxes," four principles were determined: (1) For all tax revenues levied ad valorem, a strict inspection system should be established to effectively collect taxes. (2) For all fixed taxes, they should be converted to mobile taxes as much as possible. (3) For those adjusted according to the index, the original base number should be reasonably increased. (4) There are also very detailed improvement plans for other technical aspects such as collection, payment, transfer, and disbursement.</p>
<p>財政困難已達極點</p>
<p>Financial difficulties have reached an extreme point</p>
<p>After the meeting, the reporter interviewed Qian Jianfu, the acting director of the Finance Bureau. Except for the issue of whether to open up new tax sources, which should be carefully considered, and that the specific measures in the organization of old taxes cannot be announced at this time, he reported the following situation regarding the current financial difficulties and the difficulty of fund management: The current financial difficulties can be said to have reached an extreme point. Reports indicate that the central government is also unable to continue printing money. The financial plight of local governments is self-evident. Moreover, financial reorganization values the stability of the financial order and the establishment of the financial system. Even if there are still some old taxes that can be reorganized, they cannot be implemented without being passed by the public opinion organs. Therefore, it is still of no help in the face of urgent needs. In the current economic situation, where things are changing rapidly and the currency is accelerating its depreciation, it is even more difficult to cope with unpredictable expenditures with limited income. What's more, after formulating a plan, from the time it is reviewed and passed, implemented and collected, to the time the tax is paid, a certain amount of time must pass. During this time, the price situation has already risen sharply. For example, the housing donation is criticized because the donation amount is too low, and even letters are sent to the bureau to scold it. However, it is not easy to adjust, and it cannot be done overnight.</p>
<p>今後局勢愈趨艱危</p>
<p>The situation will become increasingly difficult in the future</p>
<p>The reporter further asked that the taxes levied ad valorem and adjusted according to the index should be able to match expenditures without any problems. Acting Director Qian replied that regardless of whether the tax is levied ad valorem or adjusted according to the index, the date of deposit in the treasury is fixed, and the index on which the tax revenue is based mostly belongs to the previous period (because in fact it is absolutely impossible to collect and collect immediately according to the current index), and the expenditure is based on the price at the time of payment. There must be a considerable distance between the two, so the deficit difference cannot be avoided. For example, in addition to the fact that the public service salaries must be supplemented at the beginning of the month according to the index announced at the end of the month, they must also be pre-issued according to this standard, and the amount of the two is very large. However, no matter how much tax is collected in the few days at the end of the month and the beginning of the month, it is not enough to cope with the expenditure. What's more, the current financial problem is not only about how to adapt income and expenditure, which is the most urgent task, but also how to raise cash is an important issue, because whether or not cash is issued is closely related to the welfare of colleagues. In the eyes of colleagues, the total income is still a drop in the bucket, but those in charge of this matter have exhausted their infinite strength. The situation will become increasingly difficult in the future. In these extraordinary times, we should devote ourselves to it, and hope that the formal director will be published as soon as possible, so that we can find ideal ways to solve this difficulty.</p>
<p>市府定期召開咨詢委員會議</p>
<p>The Municipal Government will convene regular meetings of the Advisory Committee</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Municipal Government will convene a regular meeting of the Municipal Government Advisory Committee at 4 PM on the 20th of this month. The advisory committee members from various Chinese and Western roads in this city will be invited to attend. Chen Liang, the secretary-general of the Municipal Government, visited Dr. Yan Huiqing, the chairman of the committee, yesterday to discuss administrative issues related to this city.</p>
<h3>Disbursement of Relief Funds Causes Dispute: Feng Yun Files a Private Prosecution, Accusing Liu Zhe of Defamation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Feng Yun, a Legislative Yuan member from the Northeast, has filed a private prosecution with the local court against Liu Zhe, the Vice President of the Control Yuan, under Article 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, engaging lawyer Zhang Yupeng. This stems from a dispute arising from the disbursement of relief funds to refugees from the Northeast in Shanghai by the Northeast Retained Inside-the-Pass Materials Clearing and Handling Committee in February of this year. Afterwards, on February 14th in Beijing, Liu Zhe spoke to the press, claiming that Feng Yun, on the 7th of that month, at the office of the Superintendent of the Huangpu Police Sub-Bureau in Shanghai, threatened Mo Dehui with a gun, forcibly demanded a Central Bank check for 20 million yuan, and only left after forcing Mo to accompany him to cash it, portraying Feng Yun's actions in broad daylight as akin to banditry and kidnapping. These accusations are purely fictitious, as already formally denied by Zhang Weiren, the Chief of the Supervisory Office of the Shanghai Police Bureau, who stated, "The arrival of Mo and Liu at the Supervisory Office was of their own volition, accompanied by more than ten gentlemen including Dalian Mayor Zhao Ximeng and National Representative Zhao Jinbi, which clearly proves that the alleged kidnapping is entirely false." Furthermore, Feng Yun's participation in assisting with the distribution of refugee relief funds was at the invitation of Mo and Liu, and given Feng Yun's personal standing, such crude behavior would be entirely out of character. Liu, as Vice President of the Control Yuan, has unjustly slandered Feng Yun, hence the request for lawyer Zhang Yupeng to file a private prosecution with the local court, accusing Liu of defamation and seeking a judgment ordering him to publish an apology and correction in the newspaper. Feng's complaint was delivered to the local court yesterday morning. Feng Yun is currently in Taiwan, and if he has not returned to Shanghai by the time of the hearing, he will have lawyer Zhang represent him in court. The local court has indicated that it will proceed with the trial according to the law in the near future. The summons for the defendant will be sent directly to the Control Yuan in Nanjing for delivery.</p>
<h3>Housing Dispute Involves Military Personnel: Summons Returned, Refusal to Appear in Court</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Shan Shirong and Jin Lilin are subtenants of Huang Shiliang. The two parties have long been at odds due to rental disputes. On March 7th of this year, Shan and Jin wanted to sublet their rented room upstairs at No. 13, Lane 96, Jianguo West Road, to a Mr. Feng. Fearing Huang's disapproval, they invited Wang Da, Zhang Jinhua, Yao Tianfu, Wu Yisheng, and Wang Dechang, personnel from the Shanghai Civilian Self-Defense Headquarters, to help them forcibly move in at around 7 PM that afternoon, leading to a conflict with Huang. Shan and Jin incited Wang and the other four to beat Huang, causing injuries. Huang reported the incident to the police bureau, which transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. On the 5th of this month, the local court issued summonses. Wang and the others had their adjutant at the Headquarters receive them. Yesterday morning, judge Ou Shenghe of the local court held a hearing. Wang and the others, using their military status, instructed someone to return the summonses, claiming they could not attend due to official duties. The court expressed great anger at this, immediately stating that every citizen has an obligation to respond to a court summons, and ordered them not to resist the summons next time.</p>
<h3>New Pharmaceutical Industry Submits Requests to Competent Authorities: Do Not Stipulate Drug Import Ratios; Approve Direct Ordering from Foreign Countries</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association believes that due to the large variety of drugs, import ratios should not be stipulated, and that drug imports should be directly ordered by the new pharmaceutical industry, without requiring importers to handle the orders, in order to meet needs effectively. It has recently submitted separate requests to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Import Control Committee, and other relevant competent authorities, requesting that they adopt this approach.</p>
<p>According to industry leaders speaking to our reporter: the stipulated drug import ratios, particularly severe restrictions on prepared medicines, have led to an oversupply of raw materials in the city, with prices falling below foreign procurement costs. Furthermore, most of China's pharmaceutical industry is only capable of processing and packaging, not actual manufacturing. Therefore, Chinese people can only find ways to acquire well-known prepared medicines through roundabout means, resulting in large-scale smuggling. Smuggled supplies account for 80% of the demand for well-known prepared medicines. This not only fails to conserve foreign exchange but also results in the loss of national tax revenue. Moreover, the allocation and procurement of medicines require specialized knowledge and experience. The drug types and quantities arranged by importers do not meet actual needs, and their high prices, plus commissions, further increase the cost of imported goods. Therefore, they hope that regarding import ratios for drugs, whether raw or prepared medicines, the standard should be based on the needs of the time, and fixed ratios should not be imposed. At the same time, drug imports should be directly ordered by the new pharmaceutical industry from foreign manufacturers or their management offices. As the government revises import control regulations to supplement the financial and economic reform plan, they are laying out the true situation for reference and adoption.</p>
<h3>Gold Yuan Notes Disappear from Border Provinces and Counties: Postal Services Unable to Maintain Operations; Report Submitted to Ministry of Communications Requesting Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The situation of people in various border provinces and regions refusing to use Gold Yuan notes has become increasingly widespread. According to a spokesperson for the Directorate General of Posts, the Directorate General has been receiving letters and telegrams from postal bureaus in various regions reporting on the local currency situation. In remote areas, Gold Yuan notes have disappeared entirely, but postal bureaus still use Gold Yuan notes as the medium of exchange, making it impossible to maintain operations, disrupting postal routes, and causing severe hardship for employees. Summarizing the content of letters and telegrams from various locations, the main points are as follows: In areas such as Luoding, Yangchun, Xinxing, Anpu, Xuwen, Xinfeng, and Chunwan in the Guangdong region, all transactions are based on Hong Kong dollars, silver dollars, or grain. Small amounts are denominated in "Guang Hao" (Guangdong fractional currency). Merchants in Xinfeng and other places are even using grain to purchase postage stamps, which the postal bureaus are struggling to handle. In areas such as Rongjiang, Shuicheng, Weining, Sandu in the Guizhou region and counties bordering Yunnan and Guangxi, silver dollars, Guang Hao, and Yunnan-made half silver dollars are the basic currency. In places such as Mojiang in Yunnan, Gold Yuan notes are also refused, and "half coins" are used. The area around Hekou even uses Vietnamese currency as the base currency. The situation in Guangxi is largely similar to that in Guangdong. In Jiangxi, Shicheng, Ruijin, Xingguo, Huichang, Poyang, Yugan, as well as Hunan, Gan, Ning, and Qing, Gold Yuan notes have also been rejected, and silver dollars are universally used. People are requesting hard currency for mailing letters and packages. However, government financial authorities have not yet established an exchange rate between silver dollars and Gold Yuan notes, leaving postal bureaus unable to comply. Furthermore, if postal bureaus continue to use Gold Yuan notes as the sole currency for postage payments, the revenue of postal bureaus will still be in Gold Yuan notes, making it difficult to sustain the livelihoods of postal employees in those regions, which is also a thorny issue. The Directorate General of Posts has already reported the above situation truthfully to the Ministry of Communications, requesting instructions on how to resolve the situation.</p>
<h3>China Bank Jeep Accident Case: Civil Portion Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>Negotiation Elder Lawyer Jiang Yong Attracts Attention with Court Appearance</p>
<p>[Our Report] Qian Maosheng, a driver for the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, drove a medium-sized jeep owned by the bank, number 03-9280, on Nanjing Road at around 10 AM on May 24th last year. Due to overtaking a vehicle in front, he hit Yang Zhonghe, an employee of the Bureau of Materials of the Two Railways, crushing Yang's ankle and damaging his leather shoes and trousers. The police bureau transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. Before August 19th last year, the local court sentenced Qian to a fine of 100 million legal tender. As for the attached civil suit, Yang demanded compensation for spiritual and material damages of 464.28 million legal tender, equivalent to the price of 80 shi of white rice at the time, and listed Xu Weiming, the legal representative of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, as the second defendant. The case was heard by the Immigration Court until yesterday, when judge He Xianzhang held a hearing. Qian testified about the incident, claiming that Yang himself was careless and was hit by the car. Xu did not appear, but was represented by negotiation elder lawyer Jiang Yong, who has not been seen in court for a long time, attracting much attention. As Yang himself also failed to appear in court, and since so much time has passed and the currency system has been reformed, the court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing to determine if Yang had any changes to the amount of claim. Jiang then left in a hurry.</p>
<h3>Comfort Mission Visits Wounded Naval Officers and Soldiers Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Jiaotong University Student Union Organizes School Protection Team</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Following Fudan University's establishment of a protection team, Jiaotong University students also believe that the changing situation requires the school to take proactive measures and have been demanding the speedy establishment of a security team to protect the campus. In addition to the fire and rescue brigade, which is still in the planning stages, the student union has established a rather large School Protection Team. Currently, participation is voluntary, but when necessary, everyone will have an obligation to protect the school. The School Protection Team is initially set to consist of five students from the same dormitory or class, forming a security squad. Six squads will form a company, and a brigade will be formed based on the principle of establishing a first-level unit. From 11 PM to 5 AM every night, they will be divided into two shifts for patrols. Each shift will be on duty for three hours, with one shift from 11 PM to 2 AM and the other from 2 AM to 5 AM. The organizational system will be based on having the emergency response committee be responsible for organizing the headquarters of the School Protection Team, under which will be general affairs, security, fire, and rescue teams. A mobile brigade will be established when necessary.</p>

<h3>Jiujiang Struggles in a Dead Corner</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Our Report from Jiujiang, 10th] Jiujiang is now a declining market trapped in a dead corner. The bustling scene of people weaving back and forth on the riverbank and in the streets and alleys, which was common almost two years ago, is hard to find in Jiujiang today. On the contrary, people running through the streets and alleys are frowning, fearing the years ahead, unsure how they will make it through. Therefore, Jiujiang is struggling in a dead corner!</p>
<p>Jiujiang is said to have a population of 100,000, but now it probably has, at most, half that number. According to somewhat inaccurate surveys and statistics, there are fewer than 2,000 shops in the urban area. Before the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was built, it bore the heavy responsibility of handling the import and export of Jiangxi's goods. Therefore, the transportation industry, especially the transshipment industry, was a major industry in the Jiujiang market. All of Jiangxi's local products, such as porcelain, tea, and grain, were exported from here, and daily necessities such as cloth, general merchandise, and salt were imported from here. Therefore, Jiujiang had a golden age before the war. Even at the time of victory and until this time last year, although it could not compare to the past, the prosperity of the market was still maintained.</p>
<p>Now, major industries here, such as porcelain and grain, are declining in the export market due to the overall economic downturn. Especially after the Xuzhou-Huaihai Campaign and the start of the Anqing battle, in the most recent stage, it has climbed to the very tip of the dead corner.</p>
<p>The porcelain industry in Jiujiang had more than a hundred businesses before the war, concentrated in the bustling markets of Binjiang Road and Dazhong Road. When they were reinstated after the war, owing to the docking of ships going east and the brisk sales in the southeastern market, porcelain merchants spent their days smiling. So, the Jiujiang porcelain industry was still comprised of more than 90 firms when the war was over. In addition to running retail businesses, they also did export to Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. The current situation, however, has plummeted. More than half of the 90-plus porcelain merchants have closed down due to sluggish business.</p>
<p>On the way to Anqing, there were several encounters with Communist troops. The Da Yu wheel of Dada Company departed from Shanghai on March 27th, arrived in Nanjing on the 29th, sailed north on the morning of the 30th, and at 2 PM on the 31st, while passing through the Taiziji area downstream of Anqing, Communist troops on the north bank spotted the ship and opened fire. A passenger named Wang Wei Shulan was injured and died. While passing through Wulidun near Anqing, due to the shallow water on the river, the ship had to sail close to the north bank. During the voyage, it was subjected to intensive gun and artillery fire from Communist troops. Two hawkers, Luo Jiqing and Hong Laichu, were injured. On the 2nd, when sailing up from Anqing, through Guanzhou, Huayang, and other places, although Communist troops on the north bank also occasionally fired cold shots, the ship was able to hide its target more easily due to the rain and fog. When the ship arrived in Jiujiang on the morning of the 3rd, it was discovered that, in addition to Wang Wei Shulan, who was killed by a bullet during the attack, peddlers Feng Jiqing and Hong Laichu were wounded in the left cheek and left hand by artillery fire. Fortunately, there were no other casualties. Luo and Hong are now receiving medical treatment in Xun. The ship was hit by artillery fire in seven places, as large as rice bowls and as small as teacups. On the top three levels, second class, it is just a gasping for breath, fighting there before death. The price of a bucket of lace-edged rice bowls from a shop last year at this time was about two silver dollars. Today, it is being sold on the ground for only forty and a half cents, and if you really want to buy it, they will voluntarily reduce the price to make ends meet. The Jiujiang Porcelain Factory, run by Jiangxi Xingye Company, also closed down due to the black tide of market decline.</p>
<p>In terms of the shipping industry, Jiujiang is still divided into two groups: the Yangtze River and the inland rivers. The foreign ships of China Merchants and Sanbei belong to the Yangtze River Shipping Association. Ships traveling on the Gan River, Poyang Lake, and Wuxue, Hukou, and Pengze belong to the Inland River Industry Association. All Yangtze River liners, such as China Merchants and Sanjiang, as well as the Taikoo in the past, used Jiujiang as a stopover when going east or west. Since the Anqing war broke out in March of this year, the Communist troops have forced approaching units on the riverbanks, such as Huayang and Wangjiang. The vessels that have passed have been attacked by Communist troops one after another, including Da Qing, Jiang Shun, and the recently risky voyage west from Shanghai by Da Yu. The bulkheads are covered with bullet holes, and bullets penetrated from the north side and exited from the south side. The steering wheel rope and the iron-clad pipe also suffered artillery hits and were pierced.</p>
<p>Amongst the ships currently berthed in Jiujiang, are the China Merchants Bureau's Hai Yong, the Sanbei Company's De An, and the Shanghai Industrial Company's Hu Han. They can neither return east nor go west, because while there is no danger on the Xun-Han section, cargo transportation is scarce, almost non-existent. A large ship cannot cover its operating costs relying solely on the small revenue from passenger transport. Therefore, they have no choice but to rest here temporarily.</p>
<p>Although the Nanchang-Jiujiang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway extending to the head of the Xunyang River can increase the prosperity of the Jiujiang market, it is a pity that Jiujiang, which has declined drastically today, cannot accept the benefits of this railway because the market is depressed, financing is depleted, and businessmen have no power to develop abroad.</p>
<p>Currently, the entire income of the Nanchang-Jiujiang section cannot even maintain the line's regular expenditures. The person in charge of the Xunyang office of the railway is himself going to Hangzhou to seek solutions from the bureau due to the disparity between income and expenditure. In the current war-torn north of Jiangxi, apart from a few passengers who buy tickets according to the regulations, firewood, rice, fish, and charcoal from various stations along the Nanchang-Jiujiang line are crammed into the train cars by special interest single-load traders. Strangely, ticket inspectors on the line not only treat the single-load traders with "not bothering is normal," but even give passengers who buy tickets the preferential treatment of "no ticket inspection." How can the railway bureau not lose money and even "collapse" under this abnormal phenomenon? (Sent from the Garden Hotel.)</p>
<h3>Jurong's Construction</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Liu Ya-fu</p>
<p>[Our Jurong Dispatch, 9th] Since the county government completed 381 kilometers of rural power grids, it has been dedicated to public works construction. To understand the general situation, our reporter interviewed Chen Wanrui, the section chief in charge. The explanation was as follows:</p>
<p>There are three planned or urgently repaired routes:</p>
<p>(1) Jingli (Shui) Highway: The section of the highway from Nanjing to Hushu was opened to traffic earlier, but the section from Hushu through Guozhuang Temple in Jurong County to Lishui has not yet been opened. The No. 9 bridge in Guozhuang Temple was destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War and has not been rebuilt. Now, in conjunction with Jiangning and Lishui counties, a budget is being prepared for construction.</p>
<p>(2) Jurong (Yang) Highway: Tianjian Long-Distance Bus Company used to operate on this road. At that time, the Huangtu Bridge in the county was washed away by summer floods. This spring, the township authorities where the bridge is located mobilized civilians, together with the engineering battalion of the Xiongfeng Troops stationed in the county, to complete the repair, and it is now open to traffic.</p>
<p>(3) Jiangfang Highway: The project is the largest, with thousands of civilians working daily. Construction started in mid-May and was completed on the 8th of this month. It is divided into two sections:</p>
<p>1 From Longtan around Yingfangkou to Xiashu; 2 From Longtan along the Jinghu Railway, parallel and extending eastward, passing Cangtou, Xiashu, to Qiaotou. Regarding section 1, from Longtan to Sanjiangkou, the road is 5 meters wide and paved with cinder, passable in both sunny and rainy weather. From Sanjiangkou through Yingfangkou to Xiashu, the road is 4 to 5 meters wide and is an earth road, passable in sunny weather but blocked by rain, which is very inconvenient. Work is currently being accelerated to add cinder.</p>
<p>3 The middle section of the Jingzhen (Jiang) Highway is approximately 18.5 kilometers long. Thousands of civilians worked daily for more than half a month, and the project was completed on the 8th of this month. Regarding the emergency repair of this section, it is further divided into three subsections:</p>
<p>(A) From east of Longtan to the cement factory, there is an existing stone road, 5 meters wide, which is intact and does not need to be repaired. East of the cement factory, it is close to Qinglong Mountain, Laohu Mountain, Dongxi Mayao Mountain, etc. From the north side of the mountain to the mountain water ditch embankment to Shiliuyuan is about 3 kilometers. Because the south side of the road is a mountain water ditch embankment, it cannot be completely removed. The north side of the road is 1.5 to 2.5 meters of low-lying waterlogged fields, which are not easy to widen. Civilians were ordered to excavate half of the high embankment on the south side to widen the roadbed. However, after the repair, it is only 3 to 4 meters wide, which is only enough for one vehicle to pass at a time. In order to remedy this, two passing bays were added to allow oncoming vehicles to pass. Past Shiliuyuan, there is Huangni Mountain, about 0.5 kilometers long. The original Jinghu Railway passed through this mountain, and the width inside only accommodated the railway. If this highway were to be widened by passing straight through, the project would be huge, and it would be beyond the power of the civilians. Therefore, it was detoured around the edge of Huangni Mountain in a U-shape, about 2 kilometers long and 4 meters wide. The road surface is paved with cobblestones and is passable in both sunny and rainy weather.</p>
<p>(B) South of the Huangni Mountain East Railway, passing Xin'an Temple, Qianyao, Xicun, to the west end of Cangtou Street, it is repaired approximately 6 meters wide. Cangtou Street is approximately 1 kilometer long, and the road is approximately 3 meters wide. Crossing Cangtou Street, passing Xiashu to Daigongshan's mouth, is repaired according to 6 meters. The stones have not been laid, but it is already open to traffic.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Specialty: White Wax</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 10th via airmail] White wax is a unique specialty of Sichuan Province. From the Beginning of Spring to Qingming, these days are when wax merchants enter the mountains to purchase wax insects. On the roads of Sichuan and Kang, merchants in teams travel incessantly, bringing silk, cloth, and paper to transport wax insects back and forth, hanging them on wax trees. After autumn, they are harvested, processed, and refined, and transported outside the province, thereby filling the trade deficit in Sichuan and stabilizing the balance of the entire land of abundance.</p>
<p>Wax Insect Collection and Transportation</p>
<p>White wax is secreted by wax insects on wax trees and is made by cooking and refining. Common wax trees include white wax trees, water wax trees, and Ligustrum lucidum. In the production areas of Sichuan and Kang, those distributed in the Anning River Basin of Xisheng (the western part of Sichuan Province), such as the Huili area, are called "Dashan Insects" – mountain insects. Those produced in the Leshan, Emei, and Guanxian areas of western Sichuan are called "Ba Insects." Mountain insects are used for breeding, while Ba insects are only used for collecting wax. Every year after the Beginning of Spring, general "insect merchants" who specialize in purchasing insects enter the mountains in groups to participate in the "Insect Meetings" of various mountains and negotiate prices with the "Insect Owners," and then go to the mountains together to pick insects. The method is to hire pickers to climb the trees and use bamboo fences lined with paper to hold them. Each load is 60 jin, and the price is calculated by the load. After the transaction, they rush back to their original place to resell or extract wax.</p>
<p>Extraction and Refining Methods</p>
<p>The method of extracting wax is to wrap wax insects in vegetable leaves and hang them on wax trees. After the wax insects hatch, they absorb the nutrients of the tree branches and eat their young buds. After the summer solstice, they secrete a white substance that solidifies all over the tree. After the Beginning of Autumn, wax extractors carry the wax down, put it in steamers for cooking and refining to melt it. Only leaves and impurities remain on the steamer, and the wax settles in the pot. Then, it is taken out and placed in a wooden basin. This is the first time the white wax is refined, called "Yazi." After further refining, it becomes pure wax. There is also yellow wax, which is the honeycomb of domestic or wild bees. After the honey is extracted, it is made by dissolving it in boiling water. It is produced in various parts of Sichuan, with Guangyuan Zhongba being the most famous.</p>
<p>Production and Uses</p>
<p>During its peak period, Sichuan Province produced 150,000 dan of white wax annually, which was sold throughout the country, with Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hankou being the main markets. It was also sold abroad to areas such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Nanyang, with an annual amount of over 10,000 dan (over 40,000 kilograms of yellow wax annually). Its quality and abundance of production are unmatched in the country. It has a wide range of uses. In industry, it can be used to make candles. In medicine, it is used to make the shells of pills and various models. This is one of Sichuan's main export specialties. The collection, transportation, and refining are arduous. The mountain roads are rugged, and the roads are not peaceful. This year, there have been frequent reports of deaths and injuries among insect merchants. It is because of this accumulated sweat and blood that Sichuan's export prosperity has been created today.</p>

<h3>Currency Reform Suppresses Rent and Devalues, Lease Expires and Refuses to Move Out - Lawyer Jiang Pingfan Answers</h3>
<p>Li Yongkang asks: My friend Zhao rented two self-built bungalows to Gao in the 35th year of the Republic of China. Gao asked a guarantor to provide a guarantee with a neutral party as a witness, stating that from September 1, 35th year of the Republic of China, to September 1, 37th year of the Republic of China, 200,000 yuan of legal tender would be used as a security deposit. No rent would be collected, and no interest would be charged. After the expiration date, the owner would be returned unconditionally, and the 200,000 yuan of legal tender would be recovered. Last year, the lease expired at the time of currency reform, resulting in a dispute. Gao believes that the security deposit should be calculated as 200,000 yuan of gold yuan. May I ask (1) Is this request legally reasonable? (2) How many times should 200,000 yuan of legal tender from September of the 35th year of the Republic of China, to March of the 38th year of the Republic of China, be converted into gold yuan? (3) Can he be asked to move out, and is there a legal basis? (4) If Gao refuses to move, how should I deal with it?</p>
<p>[Answer] (1) According to the contract, it must be established by the consensus of both parties. If the lessor agrees to the conditions put forward by the lessee, it can have legal effect. (2) There is no explicit provision in the law. However, according to the law of circumstances, a request can be made to the court to increase or decrease it. The number of times should be determined by the court after review. (3) A fixed-term lease of two years or less cannot be requested to be vacated on the grounds that the lease has expired. (4) Both parties should jointly discuss how to renew the lease.</p>

<h3>Market Rice Prices Closely Approaching the Five-Dollar Mark, Social Affairs Bureau Orders Suspension of Trading</h3>
<p>[Our report] The rice market rose again yesterday, and the price of gold rose, making people's hearts firm. Moreover, the price in the producing area is high, the arrival of goods is scarce, and the supply is not smooth. The South Market initially rose by 20,000 to 30,000, and then rose again by 30,000 to 40,000. The reported price of white japonica and thin indica rice was 450,000 each, an increase of 70,000 (spot). The next day, the price of white japonica was 480,000 and thin indica rice was 490,000. At 10:30 AM, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the market to close because the rise was too great. The prices in the North Market were chaotic. The reported price of white japonica and thin indica rice was 500,000, and the market closed at 10 AM without any formal transactions.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the rice price set a new record. The reported price of white japonica rice once reached 500,000. The Social Affairs Bureau believed that the rise in rice prices was alarming and urgently ordered the food market to suspend trading. At this time, the opening price in the South Market was 430,000 to 450,000. After hearing the news, rice merchants, individual buyers, and local gangs from the North Market rushed to the South Market, so the price in the South Market also reached more than 470,000. At 10:30 AM, the Social Affairs Bureau received a report and also ordered the suspension of trading. Whether the food market can be opened smoothly today depends on the trend of foreign prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the prices in the rice market were extremely chaotic. The price of white japonica rice was around 500,000, and the retail price at each rice shop was indistinguishable from 520,000 to 540,000.</p>
<p>Another report: Regarding the trading of the food market, after the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the market to close yesterday morning, Cao Peizi, the director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in charge, made a statement, saying that the daily rise in rice market trading was originally limited to 10%. If this limit is exceeded, trading will be suspended. In the future, grain prices will depend on the Central Bank's sale of gold and the prices in the Wuxi producing area. The Social Affairs Bureau is determined to protect the business of general legitimate merchants. If the government is confident in control, it may handle the public sale of grain, but this is not a fundamental solution. If the government has the ability to come up with a fundamental solution, it can suppress the rise in grain prices. Currently, there is no grain shortage, but the rise in grain prices is too fast, which is very stimulating to people's hearts.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil and Flour Prices Rise</h3>

Around 10:00 AM, the Central Bank entrusted Dadecheng Gold Shop to sell 61 large bars at 3.92 million, and the market trend turned soft.

<h3>Financial Management Bureau Issues Order: No Discounting of Banker's Drafts Allowed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Financial Management Bureau yesterday issued an order to the Shanghai Silver, Money, and Trust Industries Association that the fixed-amount banker's drafts issued by the Central Bank should be regarded as cash in nature and should not be discounted. Furthermore, banker's drafts issued by various banks and firms should be issued at the request of customers and should be payable on sight, and there should be no discounting. However, due to the discovery of counterfeiting of some banks' and firms' banker's drafts, banks and firms must wait until they are presented for exchange before they can pay and use them, resulting in discounting. Therefore, the Bureau specifically ordered the three industries association to quickly seek technical methods to eliminate counterfeiting, comply with the regulations for banks and firms to issue banker's drafts, and naturally eliminate the phenomenon of discounting.</p>
<h3>National Bank Notifies Silver and Money Industry: No Longer Purchasing Gold and Silver Certificates from Banks and Firms</h3>
<p>Daily Interest Rate Soars to 300 Yuan Due to Tight Money Supply</p>
<p>The National Bank suddenly notified the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association yesterday, stating that in the past, when banks and firms were unable to balance their positions, they often temporarily requested the National Bank to accommodate them by purchasing gold, silver, US dollars, or foreign exchange transfer certificates to overcome difficulties. However, the National Bank will no longer accommodate this request in the future to avoid criticism from the outside world. After receiving the telephone notification, the Silver and Money Industry Association immediately notified its member banks and firms to implement it. It is reported that after the National Bank sold off large amounts of gold last week, the money supply became extremely tight, and some banks and firms were in a very precarious situation. They were unable to balance their positions until late at night and requested the National Bank to purchase gold and silver. However, the outside world criticized the bank for taking the opportunity to purchase at low prices for profit, so the bank decided to stop purchasing. In the future, banks and firms must carefully handle their business to avoid unforeseen circumstances. Since the implementation of this measure, the money supply has become very tight, and the daily interest rate for every thousand yuan soared to around 300 yuan in the afternoon, and financial items experienced a sharp decline.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A spokesperson for the Central Bank yesterday responsibly confirmed to reporters that the bank has indeed recently airlifted several batches of gold from the United States to Shanghai, with one batch each on April 2nd, 5th, and 9th. As for the exact amount of gold that has arrived, the spokesperson said that it was confidential and could not be disclosed directly.</p>
<p>In addition, to stabilize silver dollar prices, the bank is currently making every effort to search for raw materials needed to mint silver coins from overseas and is currently contacting various parties. However, a batch of purchased silver raw materials arrived in Shanghai by ship from overseas a few days ago. Upon opening the boxes, it was discovered that they were all silver dollars that circulated during the era of Australian coinage. These silver dollars are slightly smaller in area than the silver dollars currently circulating in China, but thicker, and the patterns are beautifully carved. Whether these silver dollars will be directly put into circulation or recast into "boat dollars" has not yet been finally decided, but they will certainly be used to stabilize silver dollar prices.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Sees Slight Price Increase, Narrow Range of Fluctuations in the Fabric Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market showed a slight increase. Under the tight money supply, large-scale transactions were not seen in the market. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 29 million yuan, but direct sales were weak. Holders were unable to push up the price, and the price gradually softened, finally closing at 27 million yuan, still an increase of 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix held steady at 11 million yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at 17.5 million yuan in the morning, once rising to 18 million yuan, but the upward trend ultimately failed to continue. The closing price was lower than the opening price, closing at 17 million yuan, an increase of 900,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods were brisk, rising from 13.9 million to a maximum of 14.25 million yuan. The midday closing was 13.1 million yuan, an increase of 800,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was 12.3 million yuan, 16-count Common Goods broke through the 10 million mark, and 10-count Boy Scout stood firm at 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>The rise in cotton cloth prices has slowed down. Due to the still tight money supply, depositors are unwilling to absorb, but holders are reluctant to sell due to high interest rates and increased costs. Therefore, the effectiveness in the market is less than before. Market prices initially rose and then remained stable. As a result, most of the prices remained at the same level as the previous day's after-market prices.</p>
<p>Spot goods of Longtou fine cloth once reached 51 yuan in the middle of the day, but no transactions were seen by the close. The midday closing price of warehouse receipts was 480,000 yuan, about 5,000 yuan higher than spot goods. The final price of Wufu fine cloth was 460,000 yuan, with no significant difference from the previous day.</p>
<p>4-Gentlemen Serge opened at 484,000 yuan in the morning, once rising to 490,000 yuan, finally closing at 472,000 yuan at midday, a drop of 2,000 yuan. The prices of other cloth factories continued to increase. The after-market initially stabilized and then fell. The price of Longtou fine cloth dropped from 480,000 yuan to 470,000 yuan at the close. 4-Gentlemen Serge initially opened at 472,000 yuan, and the final price was 462,000 yuan, a decrease of 12,000 yuan compared to the midday closing.</p>
<h3>Despite Tight Money Supply, Shanghai Stocks Still Rise in the After-Market</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai stock market fluctuated wildly yesterday, with prices soaring and plummeting. Major investors switched from long to short positions, and retail investors fell into traps again. In the early morning, it was heard that banks and bureaus were dumping yarn and gold overnight, and a large amount of money was needed to make up for the difference yesterday. Remittances from other places were about to be withheld, and the tight money situation continued. Short sellers in the over-the-counter market were continuously suppressed and were waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. As a result, rumors were rampant, and the market was pulled up and then heavily suppressed, resulting in a reversal from rising to falling. Yongsha opened at 46 yuan in the morning, and the price was continuously pulled up in the over-the-counter market, rising to 50 yuan and 5 jiao. Then it was heard that the Central Bank was continuing to sell gold, and the financial authorities were said to be banning banks and firms from mortgaging gold and silver for loans. The implicit interest rate was as high as 23 yuan, and the interest rate for Yongsha was as high as 1 yuan and 5 fen, 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen. Many retail investors rushed to sell, and short positions were prevalent on the surface. Banks and firms unanimously dumped, and the market plummeted, falling to 42 yuan and 2 jiao, with no one interested. Then, due to buying at low prices, the downward trend stabilized, and it finally rebounded to 44 yuan and 4 jiao at the midday closing.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks opened relatively stable in the morning, with limit-up prices occurring in the middle. Near the close, the prices all showed fatigue. Meiya opened high at 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen, closing at 1 yuan and 1 jiao, 8 fen at midday. Xinguang opened at 3 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen, dropping to 3 yuan and 2 jiao at the midday closing. Jingfu stood firm at 1 yuan and 7 jiao, dropping to 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 4 fen at the midday closing. Qinxing opened at 2 yuan, 2 jiao, and 2 fen, falling to 2 yuan and 5 fen. Xinyi opened at the limit-up price and remained strong at the midday closing. The rest of the miscellaneous stocks mostly rose to the limit-up price after opening and remained strong near the close.</p>
<p>In the early afternoon, due to the extremely tight money supply, all stocks opened at low prices, but the previous suppression caused strong reactions from various groups. The market saw fierce competition and bidding, and the fluctuations were still large. Yongsha initially traded at 46 yuan, once dropping to 45 yuan, but was finally strongly supported by major investors, rising to the limit-up price of 53 yuan and 3 jiao, and the transaction was closed. The initial transaction was 42 yuan, then retreated to 40 yuan, and then rose to 50 yuan and 5 jiao, finally returning to 48 yuan at the close. The stocks that reached the limit-up price included Meiya at 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 6 fen, Jingfu at 1 yuan and 7 jiao, Taiwan Sugar at 100,160 yuan, Zhonghuo at 2 yuan, 7 jiao, and 4 fen, Huaci at 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 7 fen, Xinhua at 1 yuan and 8 jiao, Zhongfa at 9 yuan, 9 jiao, and 5 fen, Business at 10 yuan and 8 jiao, Zhabei at 7 yuan, 8 jiao, and 7 fen, and Guohuo at 7 jiao. The transaction volume was 4.84645 billion shares.</p>
<h3>Special Permission Granted to Extend Deadline for Repayment of Legal Tender Bonds to End of April</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that the case of graded, doubled, and early repayment of legal tender bonds should be completed within one month. Early repayment was carried out in accordance with the graded and doubled standards from February 11th and ended on March 10th. Now, some bondholders have not yet been able to collect their payments and have applied for flexible payment. In order to avoid losses to bondholders, the Ministry of Finance has specially extended the deadline to the end of April from now on for supplementary processing. The Bureau has notified the managing banks and bureaus in various places and the bank's branches and offices to handle supplementary repayment procedures from the 14th to the end of April. It is hoped that bondholders of legal tender bonds who have not yet been repaid will go to various banks and bureaus to handle supplementary collection procedures as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Market Commentary</h3>
<p>— Spectator</p>
<p>The Central Bank Avoids Profiteering, But Banks and Firms Are Terrified Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank issued a notice to the silver and money industry, stating: "In the future, the Central Bank will no longer accept requests from banks and firms to accept gold, silver, and US dollars from banks and firms and provide cash to offset positions, because the past implementation of this accommodation method has been criticized by the outside world: It is said that the Central Bank is purchasing at low prices and taking the opportunity to make huge profits. Therefore, this accommodation method will no longer be adopted to avoid further criticism."</p>
<p>The tone is extremely aggrieved, but the means are also extremely harsh.</p>
<p>The Central Bank thought, I am doing a job, purchasing gold certificates at market prices, originally intended to help banks and firms get through difficult times. You use customer deposits to earn huge profits from gold certificates, which is why you can't balance your positions. I am helping you, but you repay kindness with ingratitude. Why should I invite criticism in vain?</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the banks and firms, this move by the Central Bank is simply deliberately making things difficult for them. Banks and firms collect deposits and have to pay interest. The Ministry of Finance opened the market for buying and selling gold certificates earlier and then restored the gold market later. If banks and firms don't buy gold certificates, where will the deposit interest come from? When the money supply suddenly becomes tight, selling gold certificates to offset positions is already a desperate situation. The Central Bank is originally the bank of banks. Supplying positions is an inescapable responsibility. Buying at low prices is tantamount to profiteering. It is not the attitude that the Central Bank should have. Now, instead of trying to improve its attitude, it simply refuses to take responsibility for relief. It cannot be said that the Central Bank's methods are harsh if it intends to sit idly by and watch banks and firms collapse due to not being able to balance their positions.</p>
<p>From the perspective of us spectators on the sidelines: Both sides have their own rights and wrongs.</p>
<p>(1) Banks and firms use customer deposits to buy gold certificates and make money. When they can't get through difficult times, the Central Bank comes to the rescue. This shows that the Central Bank's "relief" is equivalent to encouraging banks and firms to speculate on gold certificates. This kind of "relief" should have been stopped long ago. Today's cessation cannot be said to be a kind of awakening.</p>
<p>(2) Banks and firms collect deposits and have to pay a daily interest of 15 yuan per thousand yuan. Although the daily interest on loans is at least 60 yuan per thousand yuan, earning a profit of 45 yuan, the price level is so high and the expenses are so huge. Since the authorities allow the buying and selling of gold certificates, and the profits from buying and selling gold certificates are very high, the Central Bank's unwillingness to accept gold certificates when there is a shortage of funds seems unfair.</p>
<p>In fact, arguing about right and wrong is superfluous. It is important to plan for the aftermath. I have a few suggestions to offer.</p>
<p>(1) In the future, the Central Bank should first fully supply large bills and first eliminate the malpractice of banks and firms issuing banker's drafts. Because the indiscriminate issuance of banker's drafts carries the risk of simultaneous redemption of banker's drafts. This is also a potential reason shaking finance. Of course, this reason is not recognized by most banks and firms.</p>
<p>(2) In the future, the Central Bank should lower interest rates and abandon the current high-interest rate policy. This will be beneficial to prices. Especially in the current situation, the high-interest rate policy is extremely stupid.</p>
<p>(3) In the future, large banks and firms can replace the Central Bank in obtaining huge profits. As long as the business hours are extended to 8:00 PM every day. If any peer needs to adjust positions, large banks and firms with positions are happy to fully accept gold certificates and make a profit.</p>

<h3>Huili and Hualian Show Their Skills One After Another: Prelude to the Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament; Two Friendly Matches Are Wonderful</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) The Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament is about to open. Last night, the strong teams of the Municipal Gymnasium performed a preliminary exploration, attracting 3,000 fans and lively cheers. (1) Huili defeated Renyu with a score of 51 to 39. In the first half, Renyu led by one point with a score of 16 to 15. (2) Hualian defeated McLins with a score of 53 to 48. In the first half, Hualian led with a score of 30 to 18. Both opening games were quite tense and stimulating.</p>
<p>Renyu's shooting was always inaccurate, and the performance was lax. The first half was barely won by one point. Huili B team's main player Shang Chongyu scored 21 points alone, showing a promising posture. Cao Zhiji and Tian Fuhai's prowess remained the same. Huili once led by 14 points twice, and the morale was very high. The sufficient reserves were also a major reason for the victory last night.</p>
<p>The players who appeared for McLins were the Third Team, replacing the Ninth Team. The forwards Xu, Hairs, and Kai Xiong were fierce and formidable. Coupled with the Ninth Team's Laimushan, the first half was played well, especially Huarxu, who showed the demeanor of a general. McLins tied Hualian twice at 7-7 and 11-11. It is a pity that the defense was too loose, and Hualian gained an advantage under the basket, gradually gaining the upper hand. Coupled with Hualian's Liu Fushan, Bao Songyuan, and Cheng Yidi's smooth shooting, McLins' defense was finally broken, and Hualian led by 30 to 18 in the first half. In the second half, Hualian had an easy ride, and McLins tried to catch up, narrowing the gap to 5 or 6 points, but due to the chaotic formation, McLins still lost. The final score was a difference of 5 points. The battles of the two games were as follows:</p>
<p>Huili vs. Renyu</p>
<p>In the first game between Renyu and Huili, the five players for Renyu were Xu Zhongyi, Sun Guozheng, Wu Xinyun, Li Ronghe, and Zhuang Yirong. The players for Huili were Cao Zhiji, Tian Fuhai, Wei, Ye Yunshan, and Chen Zhengmiao.</p>
<p>After the contact, Huili's Zhengmiao missed a free throw, and Zhiji followed up with a basket, Zhongyi scored two baskets within 30 seconds, and Zhengmiao retaliated, tying the score at 4-4. Guozheng and Zhiji tied the score at 6-6. Renyu took a timeout, Lao Cao showed his prowess under the basket, and Fuhai scored a free throw, giving Huili a three-point lead. Suddenly, the three players Zhuang, Li, and Xu, one on the left and one on the right, allowed Renyu to surpass Huili with a score of 13 to 10. Huili replaced Cao, Wei, and Ye with Bai Baokang, Shang Chong, and Lu Dinghou. Shang showed his skills as soon as he entered the court, competing with Zhongyi, making the score 15 to 12. Yao Jiao replaced Wu. Although Yirong had not played for a long time, he performed well at this time. Xiao Yao also showed his style. Renyu's Shen Shihua replaced Zhongyi, Huili's Cao and Ye took turns, and Chong scored nine consecutive points, allowing Huili to move forward again. Suddenly, the score was tied at 15-15. Yao Jiao scored a free throw, giving Renyu a one-point lead in the first half, with a score of 16 to 15.</p>
<p>In the second half, Huili's Wei and Yunshan were fouled out, and Dinghou, Baokang, and Ren replaced Pengju. Fuhai made a quick shot, and Zhiji each scored a basket, surpassing Renyu with a score of 19 to 16. Renyu called another timeout. Xin Yun replaced Jiao. Chong's madness soon made the score 37 to 18. When Renyu changed the formation to 42 to 18, Renyu added seven consecutive points, seemingly showing signs of resurgence. Unexpectedly, veteran Zhiji showed his prowess and also added seven points, allowing Huili to lead by 14 points again. As a result, Huili defeated Renyu with a score of 51 to 39, a difference of 12 points.</p>

<p>The Hualian vs. McLins Game</p>
<p>In the game between Hualian and McLins, Hualian's starting five were Liu Fuhai, Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, Fu Jinsheng, and Wu Chengzhang. Lao Bao scored a three-pointer as soon as he took the court, and the audience cheered. McLins' Haike managed to score a basket, and Fushan also made a contribution, and Chengzhang scored again. Suddenly, McLins' Wells, Haike, etc. became active, and the score was tied at 7-7. Xiao Le replaced Fushan, and both sides were in a tug-of-war. Bao scored a free throw, tying the score at 11-11. The members of the "Tattoo Party" (most of McLins' players had tattoos on their arms) were doing well on both sides, with a score of 14 to 11. Hualian cheered on, and Le and Wu worked together, initially chasing to 15 to 14. Liangxiong replaced Zhenzhong, and Hualian's Bao, Hu, and Le were rampant, making McLins have no chance to fight back. The score was 30 to 18 in the first half.</p>
<p>After the break, Hualian's Li Zhenzhong returned to the court, replacing Fu Jinsheng, and Liu Fushan replaced Wu Chengzhang. McLins did not make any changes. After the contact, Le Jiazhou actually missed the basket, and McLins took the opportunity to attack. Kai Xiong made a basket, and Fushan scored again. Songyuan scored twice, and Hails followed suit. The battle between the two sides became fierce, and the performance was extraordinary, and fouls also occurred frequently. Laimushan scored a long shot, and Wu Chengzhang scored, replacing Songyuan. Hualian's shot went over the basket. Hails made two sneak attacks, chasing the score to 34 to 41. Zhenzhong made a long shot, and Hails and Laimushan worked together, and Hualian called a timeout. Fu Jinsheng replaced Zhang Liangxiong, Annas committed a foul, and Jiazhou made two free throws, adding to Fushan's score, and Hualian's score rose again. McLins called a timeout. Haike replaced Annas, and Fushan dragged the ball into the basket. McLins tried to catch up, but time was running out, and they made a strong counterattack. The bell rang, and the result was 48 to 53, losing to Hualian by a difference of five points.</p>
<p>Hualian's scores were as follows:</p>

After 20 minutes of stalemate in the second half, Ou Huizu from Pan Team returned a goal, tying the score at 1-1. Shortly after, Yu Lishen fouled in the penalty area and was awarded a penalty kick. Yu was dissatisfied and verbally abused the referee. Situ Hou took the penalty kick, and in order to quell the situation, he deliberately shot wildly.

<h3>Women's Basketball Techniques</h3>
<p>— Translated and narrated by Qi Gong</p>
<p>(B) Guiding fixed-position plays. (I) Fixed-position plays can be heavily used in the following situations:</p>
<p>(A) When initiating an offensive from the center. (B) When throwing the ball in from out of bounds. Speed is crucial; mastering two distinct fixed formations is sufficient to counter the opponent's defensive formations.</p>
<p>(Note) In men's rules, fixed formations can be used occasionally but not excessively, but in women's rules, they are quite suitable. As Anderson stated, mastering two formations can enhance the offense. This requires each player to clearly understand her role and know when to move, coordinating with the movements of all players on the court, working towards a single goal. This can break the opponent's tight marking defense. In China, throwing the ball in and throwing it in from out of bounds can be implemented under the cover of a screen. The disadvantage is that if the opponent's defenders see through it, they can quickly switch to zone defense to break the fixed formation.</p>
<p>(II) Key points for achieving good results in games. (A) Sufficient proficiency is required. (B) Passing and movement must be timed appropriately. (C) Allow players to appropriately utilize their intelligence. (D) Fully use and control signals and gestures.</p>
<p>(III) Suggestions for initiating an offense in China to break man-to-man defense.</p>
<p>(A) The receiver should move forward to receive the ball passed by the center. (1) The forward runs out from the corner of the baseline towards the center line. (2) The forward diagonally crosses the court from the corner of the baseline towards the center line. (3) The forward runs in a zigzag pattern towards the center line, making diagonal forward or retreating cuts.</p>
<p>(B) Variations of basic movement to receive the ball.</p>
<p>(1) When players begin to move into position—either in skirmish formation, side-by-side, or following one another in single file—their positions are in the backcourt, midcourt, or sidelines. (2) Direction—The diagonal routes for forward cross-cuts should use a figure-eight formation, and other forwards should also use the opposite cut when charging in. (3) Timing—Forwards can adopt a slow-attack method when initiating an offense to lure the opponent's defender away from their position, but they must be able to increase speed immediately. In this case, it is best for one forward to advance with high speed while the other moves slowly.</p>
<p>(C) Creating a shooting position. (1) The basic forward movement to receive the ball described in section A can follow the jump to grab the aerial ball and rebound described earlier. The player in white jersey number fifteen jumped too early, and one foot was already on the ground, so the ball was snatched by the player in blue. Looking at the position of his changing hands, it is clear that this is the result of time adjustment during the jump, faking a move in one direction and suddenly turning and charging in to create a shooting position. (2) Three forwards can split into three straight lines and charge towards the baseline, with one forward or both wing forwards circling towards the baseline, receiving the center's pass to create a shooting position. (3) The center can pass the ball to the wings and then follow the ball, circling forward. (4) Use a figure-eight self cross-cut to create a shooting position. (5) Create a shooting opportunity using a screen. For example: (A) Use a single screen to allow a forward to cut in unguarded and gain a shooting opportunity. (B) Use a screen for continuous passing into the baseline.</p>
<p>Conclusion. The above methods are effective for attacking man-to-man defense. Using the figure-eight cross-cut offensive formation and various screens often yields success.</p>
<p>It is essential that individual players are proficient in various basic skills, thoroughly understand the offensive and defensive theories of training, and use their intelligence to seize the shooting opportunities they obtain in order to break through a team skilled in moving area. (End)</p>

<p>In the match between Donghua and West Green Blue, Donghua has been consistently victorious. Securing the top spot in that group should not be an issue. Even if they lose to West Green Blue today, they will have the same record as Xun, but Xun's overall score will not be as good as Donghua. Furthermore, Donghua has many strong players like Cai Yanxiong, Zhang Banglun, Jia Youliang, and Li, who are as lively as dragons and tigers and extremely agile. The little players of West Green are difficult to match, but resistance will be inevitable when the time comes.</p>
<p>The second match between the Shan team and the Dolphin team is of great importance to the future of the top spot. According to the group, Pushui is temporarily in first place with four wins and one loss. The Shan team and the Dolphin team are close behind with three wins and one loss. If the Shan team wins against the Dolphin team tonight, then the Shan team can get first place. If the Dolphin team wins against the Shan team, then Pushui will remain in first place. Although the Dolphin team itself has no hope of finishing first, the outcome of the second place, as well as the ranking in the final standings, will depend on this match.</p>

<h3>Boston Marathon to be Held Grandly on the 19th</h3>
<p>(United Press Boston, December 12) The 53rd Boston Marathon long-distance running competition is scheduled to open on the 19th of this month, and preparations have already been completed. According to the competition director, Canari, at least 175 athletes from various countries will participate this time. Registration is scheduled to close at midnight today. Last year's champion, Korean athlete Xu Renfu, has not yet registered. Two weeks ago, Yu received a telegram from Korea saying that Xu and two other athletes were on their way to the United States. Since then, there has been no news. These people probably landed on the West Coast, hid somewhere, practiced secretly, and then sailed to Boston to make a sensational move.</p>

<h3>On Moral Standards</h3>
<p>— Wang Chongmin</p>
<p>The reason why today's society is so precarious is, on the one hand, due to the fact that society itself is suffering from quite serious ailments, and on the other hand, it must be said that it is due to the lack of correct moral concepts among the general public. Most people stand on the position of their own interests to measure morality. Whatever is beneficial to themselves is considered moral, otherwise it is immoral. Therefore, when they feel that they cannot survive, using a means of harming others to achieve their desire to survive is a very reasonable moral logic in their minds. Another type of person is the opposite of the above. Their moral views have a strong religious nature, believing that patience, tolerance, and not competing with others are the basic spirit of morality. Didn't Jesus say this? If someone strikes you on the left cheek, you should offer them the right cheek as well. They feel that this kind of sacrificial spirit is the highest expression of morality.</p>
<p>Today's society is almost dominated by these two distorted moral views.</p>
<p>For the first type of person, we can easily point out their error in moral concepts. Because survival is a very natural and urgent requirement, but using unreasonable means to deprive others of their right to survival as a price for exchanging one's own survival is a moral argument that is difficult to justify no matter what.</p>
<p>Talking about the second type of person, the reason why they "offer the right cheek to the enemy" is definitely not that they sincerely want their own flesh to suffer pain, but because the general public has the misconception that "suffering a loss is a gain." Because they think that those who hit people will sooner or later be hit by others, or even when they get to "Yama's" place, they will also be punished. Thinking like this, it seems that the one who really suffers is not oneself but the enemy, and one cannot help but feel calm and have a kind of Ah Q-style joy. From this, it can be seen that these people are absolutely not really willing to be beaten and suffer losses. Their ultimate goal is still to take advantage. The reason why they "offer the right cheek to the enemy" is just a means to achieve the goal of taking advantage in the future.</p>
<p>Now we have realized that interest—taking advantage—is the common requirement of the masses. Whether it is a murdering demon or a devout believer, they all want to go down the road of "taking advantage" directly or indirectly. Since "taking advantage" is sought by everyone, it is naturally a truth and a morality. Conversely, the saying "suffering a loss is a gain" violates the truth and also violates morality. Suffering a loss is definitely not moral, and patience is definitely not a virtue. Because true morality is definitely not teaching people to suffer losses and be patient, but teaching people how to take advantage and fight. However, if we once violate human nature and use cruel means to seize and exploit the lives and property of others as capital for our own survival and enjoyment, then we will fall into the quagmire of sin and immorality. The correct moral concept lies in how to use one's own wisdom and strength to discover new sources and create new environments, and to strive for one's own happiness and interests reasonably under the principle of not hindering the interests of others.</p>
<h3>"On Yuan Shikai"</h3>
<p>— Beibei</p>
<p>In history class, the teacher gave a topic: "On Yuan Shikai".</p>
<p>A certain student, after pondering for a long time, wrote:</p>
<p>"According to recent research, Shikai's real surname is 'Yuan', born in the 'Third Year of the Republic of China', is a 'giant' figure in the history of the Republic of China, with a majestic appearance, a radiant face, and 'bright eyes', but sometimes half-open and half-closed, in a contemplative state, very much like a great thinker of the era. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, he died of illness, but his spirit remained after his death, appearing in the world from time to time. To this day, the common people often see him in their dreams.</p>
<p>Some time ago, historians did not understand and often criticized 'Yuan'; but recently, there have been few who criticize 'Yuan' himself. On the contrary, men and women, especially Catholic personnel, mostly regard him as a 'savior', and his value has even surpassed the American sages 'Washington' and 'Lincoln'.</p>
<p>Looking at the historical figures of the Republic of China, the one who is still deeply loved by the broad masses of people is 'Yuan', who is the number one person. The facts are all there, and it is not intentional flattery."</p>
<p>Western Humor</p>
<p>— Yishi</p>
<p>A beggar followed a well-dressed gentleman, begging for money to buy something to eat.</p>
<p>"Shall I buy you a glass of wine?" the gentleman said to the beggar.</p>
<p>"I don't drink alcohol, please just give me money to buy something to eat."</p>
<p>The gentleman took a cigar from his bag and gave it to the beggar: "Take a cigar to eat!"</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir." The beggar pleaded, "Please give me five dimes, I just want to buy something to eat to fill my stomach."</p>
<p>"Okay," the gentleman finally said, "I'll give you five dimes, but you have to come home with me, I want to show my wife! What someone who doesn't drink alcohol and doesn't smoke looks like!"</p>
<h3>Tales of Wuzhi Mountain</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>Recently, a friend who had just returned from a trip to Hainan Island came to visit. During the conversation, he talked about the strange objects and scenery of Wuzhi Mountain in Hainan Island, as well as the strange customs and habits of the native Li people in the mountains. I couldn't help but listen with great interest, half-believing and half-doubting, and I seemed to see scenes like those in "Tarzan the Ape Man".</p>
<p>According to my friend, Wuzhi Mountain is covered with dense vegetation, and the grass grows so tall that it is impossible to see people. Ferocious beasts and poisonous snakes lurk among them. Except for places where there are villages, people do not dare to travel with their bare hands. Moreover, in the deep mountains, there are also strange plants that have never been heard of, such as the dragon claw vine, which is dozens of feet long and has claws on the vine that look like dragon claws, hence the name. If an animal touches the vine claw, it will be entangled by the vine, and the winding force is extremely strong. No matter how strong the animal's strength is, it is difficult to break free until the blood is sucked dry by the vine, and then the vine claw will stretch out again. There is also a kind of pitcher plant, shaped like a pig cage, with a lid on top. If an animal accidentally falls into the cage, the lid will close immediately and suffocate the animal to death.</p>
<p>My friend said that he had never seen the dragon claw vine, but he had seen the pitcher plant with his own eyes. He said that the pitcher plant is more than a foot in diameter, and small animals are often in danger of being killed by it.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of native Li people living in Wuzhi Mountain. The Li people have a slightly dark brown complexion, and most of their teeth are black. This is because there are many betel nuts in the mountains, and the Li people often eat this fruit. The betel nut juice can make the teeth turn black.</p>
<p>Both Li men and women keep their hair in buns, and the women insert flowers into their buns as decoration. Most of the men's upper bodies are naked, and they wear cloth pants. And the strangest thing is: young girls all have patterns painted on their faces. Meeting them in the dark night, they are like Rakshasas, making people shudder. However, the Li people think this is "beauty", so the more beautiful the Li woman, the more patterns and the more complex they are on her face. Sometimes, they also wear some animal bones on their necks as decorations.</p>
<p>Because their wild nature has not been eliminated, the Li people are extremely irritable and often resort to violence and murder. However, to date, 70 percent of the Li people have been assimilated by the Han people. Some of them know how to cultivate and trade, while others still live by hunting.</p>
<p>Disease is a major threat to the Li people. They have no medicine and only know how to pray to ghosts and gods to drive away diseases. In their minds, "disease ghosts" often possess women, so when someone is sick and dying, wealthy Li people will ask witches to perform rituals to exorcise ghosts. The witch gathers all the women in the Tong (Li village name), muttering incantations, and points to a woman with her finger. This woman is the "disease ghost", so a large group of people beat her half to death until the witch orders her to stop. Only then can she go home injured. Some even die for no reason.</p>
<h3>An Experiment in Focus Education</h3>
<p>— Daoxian</p>
<p>The education industry in the United States spends billions of dollars a year, but the results are often unsatisfactory. Children in modern schools know less about math and English than their grandfathers did in school. Although education authorities have made great efforts to increase teacher salaries and expand school facilities, they have paid little attention to this fact.</p>
<p>But two institutions have noticed this. One is "Hiram College" in Ohio, and the other is "Kiskiminetas Springs School" in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The education system of these two schools is extremely simple. That is: only learn one course at a time. For example, for two months, students only learn Spanish and nothing else; in another two months, they focus on algebra. Concentrate on one point and study attentively. This system is similar to the "special skills training course" run by the Army Department during World War II, and it has achieved great results.</p>
<p>Look at the schools now, students study English one hour, then algebra the next, followed by biology and history. And the teachers do not communicate with each other and assign a lot of homework. Students are either overwhelmed or simply ignore everything.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the aforementioned "Kiskiminetas Springs School" again. The headmaster of the school, Dr. Clark, carefully studied and found that nine out of ten students had no interest in the courses they praised. Students had to study hard for a certain amount of time to cope with their homework, but in fact they didn't like it.</p>
<p>Is there a way to make students love their homework? Dr. Clark studied for several months and finally came up with the idea of implementing "focus education", which began in the fall of 1944.</p>
<p>He divided the year into four semesters, each with nine weeks, and a review period in the spring. In this way, each student only studies four courses a year, and after four years, they can take the college entrance examination.</p>
<p>The result of this educational method was quite effective. Only four students were eliminated due to poor grades at graduation last year. In the past, the graduating class always had twelve to fifteen students eliminated. The general average grade of students has increased by about ten points. In the college entrance examination, the admission standard of first-class universities is between 400 and 500 points. Sixty-three Kiskiminetas Springs School graduates took the math exam, and only six people scored below 400 points.</p>
<p>Will this new education system make students feel tired? The results of the survey among students proved that it was not. Students only need to focus on studying in the classroom, and they don't need to review at home. And the students feel that they are indeed learning one course, not just rushing to finish a semester's course. Some people asked: Will students feel a lack of variety? In fact, students don't feel any change in interest when they take an English class and then switch to a trigonometry class.</p>
<p>Dr. Ballfy, the headmaster of Hiram College, said: This education system does not solve all educational problems. But in any case, it can give both smart and dull students the opportunity to develop their intelligence. It also teaches students how to solve problems sequentially, which is a valuable training for them when they enter society in the future.</p>
<p>I wonder if Chinese educators are willing to try this method?</p>
