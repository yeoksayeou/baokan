<h3 id="c1">甘介侯奉命再度來滬　敦促顏惠慶等赴平　邵力子昨返京即訪李代總統談話　京人民代表團離靑北飛 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕甘介侯二日下午一時再度飛滬。二日李代總統命敦促顏惠慶等五人早日赴平，促進和談。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕甘介侯昨日下午由京乘機抵滬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕顏惠慶等五人之和平使節團，昨日仍無新發展。據顏氏語記者：南京刻仍無啓程之命令發到，五人此次受託奔走和平，各人本身大致均無問題，主要係看中共方面是否接待。關於此一問題，刻正由李代總統之私人代表先行接洽中。一俟獲有端倪，當能確定日期啓程，惟預計三五日內恐鈣不能成行。至外傳南京人民和平代表團來滬與本人等聯絡一事，並無其事。又據章士釗語記者：渠受託奔走和平，中心宛如自紙一張，並無任何成見，故如果去平後，白紙上寫的什麼，他就照單帶回，交付當局參考。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕準備以私人資格赴平與中共接洽之江庸（五人代表之一）氏，昨否認彼等將携具體和平方案與中共作重要商洽之傳說，並聲明報載代表團於二日晨開會與分派職務之消息不確。江氏謂：彼等之目的，僅在敦促中共迅速派定和談代表與決定舉行和談之時間·地點，並無其他任務。關於五人代表人選，據悉：江庸，章士釗，顏惠慶三氏亟願為和平奔走，均無問題，顏氏以年邁體衰，將邀醫生隨往，陳光甫氏仍在考慮，大致亦無問題，僅江蘇省參議會議長冷禦秋氏，以省參會卽將開會，能否脫身赴平，尚未可知。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕邵力子二日晨十時十分自滬乘中航機飛抵南京，並於返寓小憩後，趨車往訪李代總統談話，內容不悉。晚間赴監院于院長宴，據邵氏語記者，顏惠慶等曾邀渠同道先赴北平一行，渠尚未作肯定答覆，但如果與顏等同行，當係暫以個人身份前往，而非以政府代表資格正式與共方談判。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京二日電〕政府現正等待中共指定渠等之和平代表及決定和談之時間及地點，一般希望，此事將在最近將來實現，可能卽在本周以內，，因共軍業已進入北平，完全佔領城區，過去一般均認為軍事佔領北平，卽中共之所謂「完全解放北平」。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島二日電〕京人民和平代表邱致中等一行，一日自京飛平，以平機塲在過渡時期無法聯絡，下午五時中途在靑降落，二日午成行。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島二日電〕南京人民和平代表團長邱致中曁團員吳裕後·鄧季雨·曾資生·末國樞·夏元芝等八人及隨行記者共十六人，一日下午五時自京專機飛此，因時間過晚，當留靑一夜，二日午復於滄口機塲搭機飛平，聞該團在平約留兩天，四日卽可返京。</p>
<h3 id="c2">政府尋求和平　誠意始終一貫　負責各首長隨時可由穗返京 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕近時外間對於政府南遷事競相臆測，傳說異詞，本社記者特走訪政府發言人，承其見吿如下：</p>
<p>政府以最大之誠意，尋求和平，始終、一貫，努力不懈，一月十九日行政院會議決定：「願與中共雙方卽先行無條件停戰，並各指定代表，進行和平商談」，足見政府為尊電全國人民之願望，業已進一步倡導和平，並證明政府期能早日獲得和平之誠意。但廿一日晚據新華社廣播中共發言人談話，反謂此一建議為關閉和平之門，責備政府不願派出代表與之商討停止戰爭的具體方法，政府方面期望和平之熱忱，初不因是而稍减，復於廿二日指派代表，等待中共提出商談之日期與地點，中共之反應，則為共軍節節進迫，絕無停止作戰之徵象，政府首腦部雖眞摯期待和平，但不能坐受年半之脅迫，故經一月廿六日行政院第四十一次會議議決，政府遷移廣州，並定於二月五日在穗辦公，由外交部正式通知各國使節，請其一同南遷，一月卅一日李代總統蒞滬，曾召赴穗過滬之行政院各部會首長會談，決定政府仍以萬分之眞誠致力於和平之進行，以期早日消弭戰禍，解除人民之疾苦，政府遷穗後，負責首長仍可隨時返京，繼續努力於和談之實現也。</p>
<h3 id="c3">共軍大隊騎兵　續開入北平 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>北京飯店已接收　金圓劵開始兌換</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平二日電〕北平人民政府二日開始辦公，該機構係一月前創立，總部設在石家莊，新機構在葉劍英管轄下，葉氏因而成為市長。</p>
<p>〔又電〕二日續有共軍開入北平，內有大隊騎兵，沿永定門大道開進。多數騎兵騎日本良馬，其他乘强壯之蒙古馬。</p>
<p>〔又電〕共軍二日接收故都繁華中心之北京飯店，該飯店為六層大廈，俯瞰東交民巷，乃北平最高建築物，共方擬作為軍人賓館，該飯店房各均已奉命遷出·</p>
<p>〔又電〕軍事管理委負會二日宣布，人民票為北平膩合法基本貨幣，金圓劵應卽禁止，但為便利公衆起見，准許繼續流通二十日。自二月二日起，工人，學生，廠工與貧民得作三對一之比率，以金圓劵兌換人民票，以三百元為限，超過此數將照普通兌換率兌換，普通兌換率日後另訂之，金圓劵移出北平區，應獲特別許可。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平二日電〕葉劍英將軍業於一日晚在黑暗中進城，而未如每人所揣測之凱旋式進城。報載北平「臨時混合委員會」二日在城內會議，但所議何事仍無眞正消息，極有可能之一項討論問題乃幣制問題。幣制仍在混亂狀態中，據某報載稱：金圓券將再可流通十日，其與人民劵及外幣之兌換率將於三日宣佈</p>
<p>〔又電〕人民日報北平版二日創刊，新華通訊社分社同日成立</p>
<h3 id="c4">將星集蘭州 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>張治中召集官佐訓話</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州二日電〕蘭州將星雲集，西北長官公署副長官馬鴻賓，亦於一日夜十時半抵蘭，二日午張長官治中召集西北長官公署及在蘭部隊課長·參謀以上官佐訓話，馬鴻逵，馬步芳，馬鴻賓，郭寄嶠，李鐵軍等均出席。</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州二日電〕馬步芳在蘭發表時局意見稱：和平固然很好，但共產黨有無誠意，值得懷疑。張長官現已返回，正好使西北各省加強團結。靑海部隊現分負甘，新兩省一部防務，擔子相當吃里。</p>
<h3 id="c5">蘇大使羅申抵穗　爲外交團中南行第一人 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕蘇大使羅申二日上午十時一刻偕館員十二人乘中航專機離京飛穗，起飛前邵力子氏乘機適自滬抵京降落，邵氏當於下機後，登罷中座機與之小談數分錡卽吿分別。又英大使館參事高賀祿及印·緬等國使館秘書人員，亦於二日晨另乖中航專機一架飛穗。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京二日電〕蘇聯大使羅申二日飛穗，此為外交團中隨政府南遷之第一人。其他使節除捷克與波蘭外，僅派少數代表南遷。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州二日電〕蘇聯駐華大使羅申及隨員一行卅六人，二日上午十時由京乘央航五三二號專機飛穗，下午二時半抵白雲機塲，外交部兩廣特派員郭德華等，俱往機塲歡迎，羅申大使等現下榻愛羣酒店。</p>
<h3 id="c6">首都衛戍總發言人談話　強調全面和平　長江防務堅固　接近戰區地方仍加強戒嚴 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕首都衛戍總司令部二日晨舉行記者招待會時，該部發言人政工處長羅春波就戒嚴事談稱：李代總統雖下令解除戒嚴令，惟接近戰區地方例外，故京·滬·杭沿綫仍施行戒嚴，尤其首都治安重要，該部職責所在，當加强執行。羅氏並正式駁斥有關京滬「局部和平」之謠諑，渠謂：自稱為李濟琛代表之王一東，過去為典當業公會常務理事，今竟到處招搖鼓動所謂局部和平。渠强調政府竭誠致力謀求之和平為全面之和平，平等之和平，國軍為求得和平，曾自淮河一綫南撤至最後之長江防綫，非不能打，而實為表示政府謀和之誠意與決心，如共軍妄圖渡江，繼續進攻，國軍決予反擊，長江天塹，京畿穩固，局部和平之說，殊屬滑稽。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕首都衛戍總部第三處處長易培勛，二日喹於記者招待會中報吿江北戰况稱：現在局勢極為穩定，截至目前為止，尚無跡象顯示共軍有立卽渡江之企圖，若干地區國軍雖主動撤離，然此等地膩僅有土共活動，共軍主力在徐蚌大會戰後，亟須整備，而長江一綫國軍實力雄厚，江防鞏固，京滬沿綫防務無虞。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京二日電〕李代總統一日召集師長以上將領開會，囑彼等留駐原防，繼續備戰，以待和談的結果。據接近李代總統之人士吿合衆社稱：政府的政策，卽在可能範圍中極盡全力，與共黨達成和平解決，但「如共軍企圖渡江，則將予以還擊」。軍事發言人二日絕對否認某外國通訊社（非合衆社）所稱「國軍在和談失敗時將放棄長江防綫，上海及南京，而防衛自杭州至漢口之綫」的消息。</p>
<p>〔本報浦鎭二日電〕津浦南段二日仍沉寂無戰事，國共兩軍仍在烏衣鎭南北成對峙狀態·</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕據首都衛戍總部發言人談，儀徵城確仍由國軍據守，六合城雖經放素，但六合縣政府迄在縣境內某地繼續辦公，上月底一度緊張，並傳有土共三四百企圖渡江，頃悉全係誤傳。又，江浦·巢縣亦迄在國軍固守中，</p>

<p>〔本報南京二日電〕留京立委盧郁文，范予遂，羅夢册，王鴻韶，榮照，李峯等十四人，二日連名致書政院孫院長，指陳政院前僅決議各部會一部疏遷赴穗辦公，並不影響南京爲政治重心之地位，請孫氏轉達各部會首長仍返南京，政務會議仍繼續在京舉行，以決策政事，謀求和平。十四委員並已將彼等書函分別錄送立院童院長及李代總統，且請李代總統主持此事，使政務會議仍在京舉行，以安人心，而利和平。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕立院秘書畏陳克文二日夜車赴滬，除携帶在京十四立委致政院孫院長書函外，並啣童院長命，將與在滬。杭兩地委員聯繫，探詢彼等對第三會期復會地點之意見。據悉：留京立委現約卅人，渠等咸認立院仍應在京復會，渠等已將此意向童院長陳述，然是否可成為事實，恐須視局勢之演變及各地委員之公意如何，而後方能決定。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕立法院第三會期，依照憲法規定，本月應卽集會，政府現已遷粵，立法院是否卽行在粵集會，何時可以開會，頗為社會關切，記者昨叩詢童院長冠賢，承告如次：政府現在部份遷粵辦公，並未明令遷都，政治中心仍在南京，至立法院開會，依法係委員自動集會，將來究在何處集會，何時開會，當視立法委員多數之意見與大局之情况而定、本院現雖派定人員赴穗作必要之準備，不過為萬一之準備而已。</p>

<p>〔合衆社靑島二日電〕美國西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾中將二日透露，渠將在兩兩星期以內乘旗艦厄爾多里多號赴上海，當該旗艦離靑島時，西太平洋艦隊總部亦將同時遷離。</p>
<p>渠明白指出，不論該旗艦駛往上海，香港或任何中國海港，西太平洋艦隊仍將執行國務院保護美國僑民及主要資產的任務。渠重申此係美國早已決定之政策，在最近的局勢下並未變更。</p>
<p>白吉爾中將在旗艦上單獨接見合衆社記者稱：靑島及中國其他海岸地區的局勢轉變，極可能使渠所統率之海軍及海軍陸戰隊有所調整，但渠基於國家利益的立塲，拒絕提供關於人事調動及减削之詳細數字，但渠指出：現駐於停泊在靑島的船艦之上的陸戰隊，可能調往上海，以代替駐於停泊在上海的裴斐爾特號的陸戰隊，若干並可能遺回關島，琉球及其他太平洋地區，因該處正常勤務的設備，遠較靑島為佳。渠稱：「靑島為吾人理想中的佳地，但現在美僑之撤退旣已完成，，海軍勤務的需要已不再存在，吾人正作調動，以配合局勢的需要。吾人仍將在靑島留駐若干軍力，但僅以足能担任應負的任務的人數為限，多餘的人數將調往訓練設備較佳之地，吾人並將在靑島陸上保持一巡邏隊」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕國務一院一日拒絕說明駐於靑島之美海軍擊戰隊，是否將國共軍對該市軍事壓力之增加而準備撤退。國之任何情報，將由白吉爾中將發表，按國防安全會曾授權白吉爾於緊急時撤退駐靑陸戰隊。此間對於該陸戰隊未來計劃雖缺乏情報，但據猜想彼等不致於被共軍包圍之靑島居留很久。</p>

<h3 id="c15">政治家風度的挫折 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 二月二日英文大美晚報社論</p>
<p>在一月廿四日，我們曾發表過一篇欣喜若狂的社論，題目是「至今為止最好的消息」。寫那篇社論的時候，李代總統剛宣布了許多明快的革新措施，而中共也發表了顯然是很寬大的北平的和平條件。</p>
<p>這兩件事情併在一起，實在給了中國一個好機會。雖然在過去幾天內產生了許多令人失望的事件，但是我們至今仍舊覺得我們當時的主張是對的。</p>
<p>在一月廿四日上述的那一篇社論之後，我們在同日還發表了一篇社論，題目是：「是表現政治家風度的時機了」。當時似乎誰都沒有對這第二篇社論加以注意，現在好像根本大家都已經忘記了這篇社諭了。但是，這一篇實在應當和前一篇一起注意的。中國已經面臨了一個好機會—但政治風度却簡直看不見。因之，照目前的情形看來，這個良機已在很快的漸漸消失了。</p>
<p>在一月廿四日，我們以為，在蔣總統在任的時候，也許李副總梳早已和中共先已有所商洽。關於這一點，我們似乎是完全猜錯了。不但毫無事前商洽的跡象，而且，每一小時的躭擱，都已經破壞了任何商洽的機會。國民政府（原文—譯者）的分化正在加速進行中，這種分化，在相當時期後，也許會使李氏和其親信所能獲致的和平事實上竟祇有局部和平的性格，而並非全國性的和平。</p>
<p>在習慣於國內分裂的中國人看來，這種發展也許並非什麼了不得的大災禍，但是，這却決不是够得上政治家風度的。</p>
<p>當李氏接受政權的時候，他所担任的是一個「法理的」政府的　事實上的」領袖。我們的意思是：雖然蔣總統僅是「引退」，而實際上顯然仍在遙領政務，但李氏所接管的政權是由世界列强在外交上予以承認，而且在聯合國機構中派遺了代表的，卽使這政權已是拖泥帶水，備受挫折，它畢竟還是名正言順的。但李氏接手之後，他的下屬並未協力使他的革新措施二實現，而若干部隊長官也顯然不肯接受命令，因之他們的部隊就很快的移開，從這些地方看來，李氏似乎並沒有能够充分控制這個機構。但是，在全世界的目光中，李氏現在倒底是一個大家所承認的中國政府的領袖，所以，如果小共現在能够很快的和他簽訂和約，實在是中共之利，也是李氏之利，而且，對中國也是有利的，因為任何協議與統一，總此以往所發生的或將來可能發生的種種情形好一些。</p>
<p>就目前的情形說，我們覺得李氏並沒有錯。犯了錯誤的是中共，而且也許他們還是故意犯了這個錯誤。如果情形確是如此，我們以為他們的眼光實在太淺短了。這種錯誤使中國在能得到任何統一跡象之前又須遭遇到更長期的苦鬥，使人民更長期的受難—而使人民受難却是和中共一向號召的主張完全相反的。</p>
<p>也許，他們這樣做的理由，是要得到無條件投降，而且以為局部性的無條件投降比和李氏代表的政府協議和平更為有利—因為，與政府協議和平後，必須立卽淸除各不合作的分子。但是，這些不合作分子，卽使可能包括蔣總統本人，是可能被稱為叛逆的，中共本身就久曾得到了這個稱號。</p>
<p>除此之外，我們實在不明白何以有那種缺乏政治家作風度的堅持要交出戰爭罪犯的要求。從前，羅斯福總統在對日戰爭中而臨到這種情形的時候，他的熊度正好和中共相反；誠然，他也要求無條件投降，但是却從未先對戰犯事件大吵大鬧，而且特別把該國的元首免其戰犯處分，因為裕仁是協助了投降的。李氏當然應當立刻得到這種待遇，如果能把蔣總統的名字永久從這種名單上剔除，也一定會得到全國人民的支持，上海的吳市長也根本不應列入這種名單，實際上，在內戰中旣不適用國際法，全部懲戒「戰犯」的想法都是不通的。</p>
<p>現在趕快收拾，尚不為晚。但是，在這種事件中，時間是很快就會消失的。不久，國民黨內的反對派也許就可能使李氏所能獲得的任何和平都成為像傳作義的和平一樣的局部性。這樣一來，各種困難就要延長，也就引起了許多不必要的甚或惡意的外交上承認的問題，總而言之，全部弄糟。自前，我們已經沒有以前那麼高興了。中國歷史上更多更重要的人們都有同感，無疑的，他們所感的是較我們更深切的。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3 id="c16">由史達林的和平姿態說起 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>史達林最近答覆美國國際新聞社記者的問話，對於當前的世界問題，提出四項意見：（一）蘇聯政府準備考盧與美國政府發表共同宣言，表示美蘇兩國政府均無以兵戎相見之意向；（二）蘇　政府顯與美國合作實施此項非戰公約，並領導各國逐漸裁减軍備；（三）英美法三國政府若能同意暫綏設立西德政府，靜待外長會議檢討整個德國問題，則蘇聯政府願解除對柏林之封鎖，惟英美法三國亦須同時解除其對於運輸及貿易之限制；（四）余已迭次聲明，願與杜魯門總統會晤，直接討論此項和約之可能性。</p>
<p>這四項意見，可以說是史達林的和平新姿熊。不論史達林的談話是否能成為事實，在國際氣壓低沉令人窒息的今日，終不失為黑暗中的一綫光明，由渴望和平的世人聽來，更覺得是令人興奮的和平福音。所以，倫數華府的外交界人士聽到了史達林的聲明，對於出窮水盡的世界和平，又復引起柳暗花明的希望心理。不過英美兩國政府的反應並不如理想的熱烈。</p>
<p>華府方面不僅非常泠淡，而且認為史達林的聲明，是一種一和平攻勢」，以轉移西方各國刻正集中在北大西洋公約的視綫。杜魯門總統看了史達林談話的全文，也沒有加以評爾，僅由秘書羅斯向報界談稱，杜魯鬥總統會屢次表示，史達林隨時前來華府，均願與其一談，如此而已。此在一般外交界人士，則更盼望蘇聯在顯示和平新姿熊之後，能確有事實的表現。</p>
<p>在英國方面，外交界人士對於史達林的和平新姿態，雖極震動，但是外務部仍淡然置之。據外務部發言人談稱：英國將與美法兩國磋商史達林的談話，以研究美蘇關係好轉的可能性。不過蘇聯外交部在史達林發表談話之前，會發表白皮書，對於西歐聯盟與北大西洋公約，均加以猛烈的攻擊，指斥英美兩國走向新的國際戰爭。準此而論，英國對於史達林的眞正意向，也不能深信不疑，是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>我們回顧第二次大戰結東以來的國際政治，不難證明今日國際問題的癥結，厥在美蘇兩方的積不相容；這世界的兩强，如能有釋嫌修好的一天，則目前的一切國際問題，不論是歐洲問題或是亞洲問題，或許可望迎刃而解。我們基於這個看法，認為如欲世界能獲致眞正的和平，則必先謀得美蘇間的諒解與協調。凡是眞能促進美蘇關係好轉的行動，不論發自何方，都是我們愛好和平人士所歡迎的。記得蘇聯駐美大使館於上月中旬發表一篇論文，主張「雙方諒解以促進美蘇間的友誼」，當時我們就十分重視，並希望它能成為美蘇關係轉變的契機。然而美方態度冷淡，也就像皂泡一樣吹了。當時代理國務卿羅凡特雖也表示歡迎蘇聯的和平意向，但仍堅欲蘇聯能有事實的表現；以證明其對和平的誠意。現在，美國務卿雖已易人，但是美國的對蘇態度，依然如舊。職是之故，由史達林談話所引的和平希望，恐怕也要像皂泡一樣隨風而去了。</p>
<p>站在第三者的立塲，觀察美蘇關係，不論在思想方而或在利害方面，都是處於相反的地位。今日欲求兩國改善關係，釋嫌修好，自非一蹴可聲·但是改善蘇美關係的機會，和其他的機會一樣，也是稍縱即逝的。現在國際間旣有此新的醞釀，美蘇雙方就該特別珍重此一良機。在史達林方面，旣已顯示出和平的新姿態，就該更有事實的表現，以證明其確具誠意；而在美國方面，則亦宜抓住機會，消除兩國間的戾氣，扭轉國際間的逆流。</p>
<p>但是，社魯門總統在競選時早經說過「我們都需要和平」，爲什麼此時不能爽快的熱愛史達林的建議，迅即在某地會晤，而美國外交界則更盼望蘇聯能有顯著的事實表現呢？一言以蔽之，揆之共產國際之策動，蘇聯謀和之誠意不能為美國所輕易置信罷了。舉一反三，中希望他們有些具體的事實表現，而不止於廣播中的「命令」姿態。事實表現是什麼？首先是雙方同意立即停戰！</p>

<p>— 本報記者劉孟痴</p>
<p>息烽女縣長許芳媛，於去夏到任不久，就逢着一向以祟法務實不茍言笑見稱的谷正倫回黔主政，當時無論誰都以為她必定是被調換的居多，那知她竟能穩住到現在，而且還似乎「頗有政聲」理。</p>
<p>谷正倫在接任省主席後，曾經分批接見各縣縣長，許縣長謁見主席的時候，侍從把她誤會為許縣長的太太，向谷正倫請示見與不見，一時傳為佳話。因為她曾受過高等敎育，從事過多年的婦女運動，憑雄三寸不爛之舌，從地方基層政治談到她的人生抱負，據說她初次謁見谷主席，談約兩小時許，超過任何縣長的談話時間，谷對她的「印象殊佳」，她的縣長就從此穩住了。</p>
<p>各方一致好評</p>
<p>冬天，監察院　貴監委行署委員呂超來黔視察，在女縣長的息烽視察了一個禮拜，回到筑昆兩地之後，曾迭次向新聞記者作過口頭讚揚，報紙上作過文章稱追她。最近，黔省府的年終縣政考察團分路出發，考察各縣縣政，担任考察息條縣政的省壘糧處長謝伯元氏，返省報吿，他對息烽縣政，尤其是糧政，役致，深為嘉許。省軍管區司令部並曾於卅七年度役政考核總評結果，認為她頗能遵從法令，如期如數的辦到合法合格，給予記大坊一次。女縣長經這幾度「棒」與「考」，不但穩住了，而且「紅」起來了。</p>
<p>記者頃自民政鐵親察息烽　政，雀府年終縣政考察團，及軍管區役政視察人員方面，獲得關於女縣長的施政資料頗為不少，碰巧昨（廿五）天又在省府遇着女縣長本人「公私兼半」式的返省述職，因為再隔三天便是農曆新年，女縣長向省府請了一週休假，回省來一叙天倫之樂，昨天她和記者娓娓而談其「所獲安慰」，達一小時許，言下頗有得色，事實上證明女縣長畢竟不同於男縣長。</p>
<p>據女縣畏答復記者，到任迄今，以何項施政為最見績效？她略加思考之後，很爽朗的說：「我在息烽是秉承主席减輕人民負担，切實興利除弊的意志而努力從事，施政方面因限於她方財力人力，不敢證有何績效，但對於如何减輕民負，興利除弊，確也有些收獲，自已親誤見到，也可說有些安慰。」她接着便把她背得爛熟的「谷主席言論集」上面那一套理論，和記者背誦一番，她說她到任迄今還不及十個月，已把全縣十七個鄉鎭完全走遍了一次，並且每隔一個月，還分路出巡各鄉鎮，去作特別考察，每次大約為時一週，親自去看老百姓的苦難生活。她指着她所穿的淺灰色呢夾克和棉布下裝和記者說：「這是到省上來，纔換一件呢夾克，在縣裏樣騎着馬到各個鄉鎭去出巡」。她答復我，她的馬騎得很好，翻山越嶺，操縱自如，女縣長的身體本來就很健康，九個月來的鍛鍊，使她更見強壯了</p>
<p>糧役鹽三要政</p>
<p>她談得最多的是息烽糧政，對於公糧，絕對禁止假借名義以低價變賣之後繳庫做賬，實際是私人買過手後再高價賣出深飽私囊，她說這種「低賣徴庫」，是瘦了公家，肥了私人，　對不許可。其次，他嚴禁對上處報收數，對下征收濯納罰款，而又把這種滯納罰穀作為田糧人員的「私包袱」。她說，息烽田賦征借，現在確確實實的已經收起九成，這可以間省田糧處謝處長，他是深知的。谷主席不許各縣田糧人員冒名浮收，要人民自拷自括，地下餘榖要准許人民處置，她在息烽嚴格執行的時候，上糧的人無不對谷主席稱顯不已。</p>
<p>女縣長把她辦理役政如何合理合法，公開抽籤，嚴禁頂替這一套　完之後，我問她，自衛特捐每戶月出兩市升米，一次征收三個月，這辦法，對於减輕民負，是否說得過去？她想了一想纔答復記者：「息烽還未開始征收。每戶月出兩市升米，一次征收三個月，或許有困難，最好是能按照賦額衛定，錢多多出，錢少少出，要公平合理些。」她表示這須由省府決定，息絛不敢自作決定。</p>
<p>記者和她談監政積弊的時候，她說：「息烽　政已無弊端，所有的是配額不足。」她絕對禁止官商勾結，打食豐主意，每月配顯一定要鹽業公會督飭遲銷商，如額如期運到縣境內，公開報賬，再轉發各鄉鎭去，照規定價格售與人民，並須登記備查，以便由縣至鄉核對食鹽運銷情形。」她說她過去曾經和人合夥做過　生意，深知其中弊端百出，但自從担任縣長後，卽絕未染指，並且解除過縣府裏面一個負有重要責任的職員，因為他有勾結鹽商作生意的嫌疑。</p>
<p>興學興種美菸</p>
<p>接着，女縣長談到她興利施政方面。息烽的敎育事業，如鄉鎭保國民學校，過去只重量的發展，忘却質的提高，尤其敎育經費最成問題。她到任之後，卽大量裁併保國民小學，把全縣十七鎭鄉五十四個保國民小學，斟酌損益裁併了一牟，集中財力人力，來辦理留存的二十七個小學。因為廟產捐作校產的糾紛，歷年從未解決，她曾舉行過全縣佛敎大會，當衆减免各寺廟的一切捐款，要他們把早先已經捐贈的廟產，照着初衷把手續辦淸，並約請縣佛敎會，捐贈產業的寺廟主持，參加縣敎育經費保管委員會，共同負責保警，一面還把所有的敎育產業契據，編號謄副，分別逞送省敎育廳和縣參議會備案，縣敎育經費從此得以獨立華息，將來不愁發展。</p>
<p>「息烽太窮，人民艱苦，我到任時便提倡種植美菸，縣府職員也要去參加栽種，最初大家都不滿意，因為那時美菸價錢太低。」許縣長笑了一笑，接着說：「不久，美菸價錢天天上升，現在已到一千三四百金圓一百斤，人民無不喜形於色。全縣所產美菸，去年不到五萬斤，今年至少有三十萬斤，縣府職員也收獲了四五千斤，我完全交由全體職員分配，作為他們勞力所得的安慰。」她最援還說到，人民是短視的，除弊比較容易，興利實在艱難，不過只要為政者有決心，人民在受到一些利益之後，以後與利的施政就容易推行了。</p>
<p>婦女界的光榮</p>
<p>女縣長在息烽已獲得了人心，在省方已獲得了信心，男子們對她無論當面背地都對她有了一致的稱道，尤其婦女界，提到她更感光榮。據接近女縣長的人談，問題很簡單，她不但不想亂搞錢，而且願意賠錢，她的政治慾望很强烈，作縣長不過是她政治生命的起點，加上她肯實幹，苦幹，又比較願意採納人民的意思，所以她的縣長穩住了，而且「紅」起來了！何况她的「先生」孫伯陶是大定縣的地主，貴陽的財主，而且又很尊重她的意見</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓二日廣播：倫敦某電訊社所傳史達林致美國國際新聞社巴黎分社史密斯之原函全文如次；「敬悉杜魯門先生邀余前往華府，深表感謝。余久有赴華府之意，前曾在雅爾達將此意吿羅斯福先生，其後在波茨坦時亦曾面吿杜魯門先生。不幸目前余已不能實踐此顯，因余之醫生曾向余正式警吿，謂余不宜再作長途旅行，尤不適於飛行或航海。如杜魯門先生能來蘇聯，蘇聯政府不勝歡迎。會晤地點，敬請杜總統於加里寗格勒·敖德薩·成雅爾達三地之中任擇其一，悉聽總統尊便。然余所建議之上述地點如不獲贊同，則亦可請總統在波蘭或捷克二國中選探之。史達林敬啓」。按史氏健康情形，外人知者甚鮮，目上次戰後，史氏確會作長期休假多次。但曾見史氏之外國使節，則謂渠精神旺盛，頗為健康。史氏近來所擺照片中，除雙髪益見班白外，容色實與前無殊。今日史氏函中謂不適飛行，按飛行於其種心臓病患者及有高血壓者殊不相宜，但多數聲生皆以為航海實於病人有益也。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓二日廣播：白宮新聞秘書羅斯稱，杜魯門總統並未接到史達林建議樂行何種會談之任何邀請，並謂據渠所知，杜魯門對於此種建議之最近表示，為渠願意在華府會晤史達林。羅氏稱，關於史達林之最近建議，杜氏所知者僅由廣播及報紙所傳。記者詢其杜總統是否願意前往波捷，羅氏不待記者說出蘇聯一語，卽挿嘴答稱，「沒有意見，完了」。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓二日廣播：美國務院發言人稱，渠曾非正式聽到史達林建議在蘇聯·波蘭或捷克會晤杜魯門之傳說，但對於此項傳說亳無意見。三天前史氏曾表示願與美國簽訂「非戰」公約，據無綫電台報吿，史氏最近發表之文吿，有一值得注意之點，卽史氏並未提掛西方國家所謂「鐵幕」後之地點，作為可能之會晤地點。史氏文吿顯示渠無意離開蘇聯控制之地區，與杜魯門商談和平問題。華盛頓及倫敦方面對此文吿所發生之反響，認為史氏僅係發動「和平宣傳攻勢」，此項文吿使史達林保持一種立塲，倘杜氏拒絕接受會談建議，則史氏可昭吿世人謂美國不願商談和平。其次，如杜氏接受建議，則迫使杜氏在蘇聯控制區域內舉行會談。倫敦方面雖無官方正式表示，但恐蘇聯之「和平攻勢」或將促成並無英國代表參加之兩國會談。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓二日廣播：國務院發言人麥克德謨透露，關於史達林最近文吿，並未接獲正式報道，故暫時不擬發表任何意見。華府方面認為史達林適於北大西洋聯防公約草擬細節之際，提出與杜魯門會談之新建議，蘇聯意欲阻止該約之簽訂，似無疑義。蓋蘇聯倘能獲致兩國會談，勢必引起英法等其他西方國家對美國之猜疑與不信任，而蘇聯卽獲得外交上之勝利矣。</p>

<p>挪威曾希望聯合國機構供給必要力量，維擭世界各國之和平與安全，但此種希望尚未實現。為本身安全計，挪威深信有經由區域防禦合作以促進安全之必要。挪威政府認為此種區域條約，符合聯合國憲章，志在防杜侵略。挪威今後將進一步研究在何種方式與條件下，可能參加區域安全體制。挪威與鄰邦蘇聯友誼素篤，深信蘇聯政府必能認識挪威之和平意棚，及對全體愛好和平國家維持友誼之志願。蘇聯日前曾質問挪威是否參加未來北大西洋盟約，及是否以軍事基地畀予西方國家。半官人士稱：挪威之答覆熊度堅決。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕太平建元兩輪沉沒後，遇難乘客家屬已在中聯公司內組織辦事處，按乘客艙位等第舉辦登記。合灣方面家屬代表十一人亦已來滬，會同上海代表，積極籌劃打撈及要求撫卹等善後事宜。昨各家屬曾自費包機一架，飛赴出事地點附近各島偵察，惟結果仍毫無所獲，留駐海面之「海川」輪亦無若何具體報吿。據各方觀察：此次該兩輪之沉沒，係完全傾覆，且當時所有乘客船員俱集中頂層，而非關閉艙中，故屍體可能四散飄流，打撈工作殊多困難，再以該兩船沉沒地點，迄目前止尚未有任何方面加以正確之判定，勘察工作更無從着手。若出事時果尚有出險者已到達附近各荒島，但一週來饑寒交迫，其後果亦頗難想像云。再太平輪罹難乘客中，據悉本報前駐福州特派記者陳正宇亦在其內，陳君係搭乘該輪赴台度歲，不料竟選慘禍，現渠幼弟陳守廉已趕來上海料理善後。</p>

<p>晨友盃籃球乙組總決初賽，昨晚六時起在八仙橋靑年會舉行，共計兩幕，首塲籃友對公交，由吳子彬劉荷生執法，接觸後，籃友陣脚鬆動，隙漏甚多，公交乘機猛攻，着着佔先，上半時終了，公交以廿八比十四遙領，易籃後，籃友力事整飭，戰局果見好轉，逐步逼進，無奈前半失分過多，時間有限，迨至終塲，籃友仍以五九比四二淘汰。</p>
<p>繼之天章與合衆對壘，裁判劉荷生狄憲章，合衆技高一籌，下堪卽佔先手，天章力禦無效，上半時比數，合衆廿三天章十四，相差九分，休息再戰，合衆諸將依舊活躍，分數扶搖而上，天章力戰，雖略有所獲，但得不償失，結果合日衆以四一比廿六獲得勝利晋級。</p>

<p>農暦新年忽忽的來臨，又已忽忽的過去，記得在除夕的前幾天，我們曾經以最高的誠意，呼籲讀者在新年裏面節省龐費，以所得捐作助學金，救濟窮苦的靑年，使他們免遭失學的厄運。</p>
<p>到昨天為止，我們還沒有收到一筆可觀的捐款，眼看寒假卽將屆滿，無數淸寒學生，正在引領盼望着我們的帮助，熱心的讀者們：假使你們對這些淸寒學生表示同情的話，現在正是一個良好的機會，對於捐款購米的事。現在先作一個簡單的報吿：</p>

<p>這幾天物價似瘋狂的速度上漲，假使我們不採取購存食米的辦法，到開學的時候，一定會使全盤計劃都成泡影，所以我們一有捐款；當天趕快購米存儲，最後我們希望讀者能够不斷的捐款，使助學金早日達到預定的目標。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕過了春節，物價猶如一塲春夢，醒來時全都翻臉不識人。此中以黑市金銀所漲最凶，里巷處處可噹響着的銀洋，過了五天春節，前後跳了足足三倍。其他吃的穿的，大多漲上一倍到二倍。按例，前晚吃過財神泗，昨天商店就該開張做買賣了，但蹓躂街頭，店家開張的不過半數，開張的也都是排門半掩面，樹窗裏稀稀落落的點綴些微商品，有些捨不得賣掉的樣子。</p>
<p>四大公用作日第一天開張，　　却瘳寥可數，大家帶着新奇的神情，欣賞各種商品的新高價。一雙短統的小囡紗襪，標價一百四十元。西裝襯衫最起碼的每件要九百元。小毛巾每條在二百元左右。茶食部的餅乾，都已十瓶九空，賣剩的鹹梳打，每鎊標價二百四十元。香腸受了肉價狂漲的影響，每斤六百四十元。好的香菌每斤要二千元。其他像烟泗等奢侈消耗品，價更驚人。一瓶上等白蘭地，標價一萬元。古巴馬尼刺等地製造的雪茄烟，扁扁的廿五支裝一盒，標價八千八百元。紳士們頭上戴的哈德門呢帽，每頂標價一萬三千元。還有，小姐太太身上穿的獺皮大衣，鴻翔公司每件索價卅二萬元。要定做的話，須照價一次預先付淸。公司裏的夥計說：「沒法子，價錢天夭有上落」。</p>
<p>市民們最關切的食米和菜蔬價格，春節的幾天中，簡直陷於空前無政府的混亂狀態。白粳昨天紅盤開出，大致在四千三四百元之間。可是春節的幾天中，米店喊價有達六七千元之鉅者。昨天依然有許多米店尚未開張，就照紅盤標準行市，也已較大年夜漲上二倍。</p>
<p>豬羊肉猛漲　白菜身價高</p>
<p>小菜價格，各處小菜塲價格雖參差不一，而趨勢總是一致的猛漲。其中以猪牛肉所漲最多，例如猪肉，在前天最高價喊過四百元一斤，零售價腿精每斤自三百元至三百六十元。昨天價稍回，每斤自二百八十元至三百廿元。牛肉每斤屹立在三百元關口。雞每斤自二百四十元至三百元，視瘦肥而上下其價。雞蛋漲勢也達二倍，大年夜八十元一斤，昨天紅盤另售價每斤二百廿元。批發蛋行大號蛋每個賣廿二元到廿五元，可是攤販每個要賣到四十元。他如鮮蝦每斤三百六十元，靑魚每兩十五元，草魚也要十元。</p>
<p>蔬菜中白菜身價高，每斤四十元。可是春節的幾天中，塔窠菜每斤居然索價卅五元。昨天行市轉穩，小塘菜，塔窠菜，菠菜，雪裏紅等每斤已降至自十五元至廿元。黃荳芽要廿五元。荳腐每方要廿元，洋薯每斤卅元，番茄每斤居然要八十元。</p>
<p>中紡公司前　重見長蛇陣</p>
<p>他如燃料，棉布，捲菸，肥皂，套鞋，運動鞋等日用品，無一不漲。煤球昨天已調整為母担九百元，漲了一倍。德士古煤油公司經理處的火油，每聽（五加侖裝）開價三千元，漲上二倍有餘。龍頭細布每疋五千元，中紡第二門市部鬥口又出現長蛇陣。肥皂零價每塊要六七十元。元寶型套鞋每雙要四五百元。長統套鞋每雙二千元，籃球鞋每雙要八九百元。就連大衆的精神食糧——日報，報館雖仍維持老價每份五元左右，可是報攤每份一律索價十元。</p>
<p>如此物價，商人口裏依然振振有詞，認為照金銀價格，商品價格漲得還不够比例，似乎總覺得自己手裏的商品特別廉賤。可是在一般市民看來，這些空前高價的商品，祗好當作點綴品來欣賞了！</p>

<h3 id="c79">新春紅盤上海一倍半　當局今日拋售物資　金管局決大規模撲滅金鈔黑市 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日各市塲開出紅盤後，上午因各帮顧慮當局將拋售大量物資，故行情穩定，至午刻因拋售朱見實行，致市面大漲，迄晚收盤時，計較去年封關時漲起一倍半以上。據有關人士之觀察，此次新年紅盤漲風之造成，矢局緊張為其主因，故物價之上漲為全面性，漢渝穗各地均見漲風，而非限於上海一隅，尤以天津之物價，較本市高出一倍以上。目前集中上海之游資，估計已在一百億以上，此額游資之製造者，為漫無限制之通貨膨脹政策，新鈔之發行，集中上海一地，而金圓劵之流通地區，正與日俱减，舉北平津等大都市已被「解放」，華中各省市盛行以銀元交易，金圓劵已被驅遂，致每次新發行，均以上海為唯一之活動塲合。以拋售物資而言，昨日當局僅拋出一部份合糖，為數不大。糧食則負實當局表示需於必要時拋出，紗布拋售事宜，昨日紡建曾開會商討，已有所決定，在漲風猛烈時，該公司始能有所行動。物資供應局各項物品，則申請手續需時。綜言之，當局對拋售物資，已採取現實政策，卽承認市價，逢高拋出，而不願以遠低於市價之價格拋出，以致消耗物資，最後仍難穩定物價。聞當局已定今日起，大量拋售物資，打擊投機；同時金管局將採取配合行動，大規模撲滅金鈔黑市交易云。</p>

<p>北市特商粳四千六百元　粉糧油餅劇升一倍有奇</p>
<p>米市紅盤昨日開出，因在新歲中業外各物狂漲，及塲外價格本已高昂，致較去年猛漲一倍半餘，北市塲白粳四千四百元，較去年收盤狂漲二千八百元，薄稻為四千三百元，早稻三千九百元，特高粳四千穴百元，均猛漲二千六七百元。南市塲初開較高，後市回軟，白粳收市四千二百元，早稻初為四千元，收市三千九百元，各漲二千五六百元，昨日到貨甚少二市共計三千二百二十一石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>紅盤跳升一倍，綠因新歲期間，各物波動頗烈，人心一致看好。初市大發首以千三百五十元開出，兵船繼之以千四百元成交。老車初開千四百五十元，中市貨主哄抬，一度高喊做千五百元，經市塲某負責人勸吿，人心才吿鎭定，後市未見做開。紅蜂建成一律晋升一倍，麩皮先堅後回，福新大包臨收以千一百元成交。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>紅盤，展開猛烈漲風，因時局不定，產區來貨大减，市塲供不應求，黃豆漲勢最烈，油廠吸取甚多，漢口乍豆疾升千元，以千九百元成交，後市執戶扳持，喊價突破二千關，惟無正式成交。車豆昨做二千四百元，收市喊做二千五百元。生仁跟升倍餘，芝蔴苞米紅糧，一律提升一倍左右。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>昨開紅盤交易，價格猛升，因在新歲中其他各物上漲頗烈，故亦狂漲，雖然暫停出口，但因存貨少，到貨稀，故貨主力扳，價格上漲較其他糧價為烈。豆油收市一萬八千元，生油達二萬元，生菜油一千六百元收市，各較去年收盤價狂漲二倍，豆餅收市一千四百尚買不進。</p>

<p>昨日為新正紅盤第一日，太市各業市塲，均已復業。業務經數日小休之後，無不生意興隆。各方年關前後雍積之游資，大量流入市塲，以致銀根走勢，異常鬆和。市塲暗息，最高做四十元，大致均在卅元至卅五元間。政府有拋售物資，抽縮銀根策劃，故人心頗多戒心。但一般均信本市資金泛濫過甚，一時極難加以抽縮。</p>
<p>現鈔籌碼，昨日甚裕，年前大量散流民間之鈔券，紛粉回籠。行莊收款檯子，異常忙冗，乃為近所罕見者。提領多不復再有限額，貼水現象全戢。</p>

<p>桐油昨市：公會牌價，迨至午後尚未議開，而同業喊價，則因八大公用事業猛力加價，影響成本不已，故均追隨翱翔，足度白油與正牌西洪，竟達一萬二千元，餘如副牌西洪及靑油，一致比農曆除夕激增二倍左右，交易則均乏實際，大致須待今日始能納入正常，開做紅盤交易。</p>

<p>人絲昨日紅盤開開做，市况急遽上升，開關後，市上銀根益見鬆動，買氣極旺。一二〇號天橋晨開一五五〇〇〇元喊做，後因金價黑市暴漲，人心浮動，檯面再起哄抬，漲勢甚勁，喊價飛升至一八五〇〇〇元，迨至收市走勢仍挺，納胃不弱，結果又好五〇〇〇元。較農勝年內約升一倍多。</p>

<p>四十二支藍鳳晨喊一六五〇〇〇元，進方恐當局拋售，納胃甚淡，市勢平軟。嗣以美援會昨日未曾掛牌開售，塲上買風頓起，瞬息喊高至二一〇〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>二十一支雙為，初以一二〇〇〇〇元喊做，絨布一一五〇〇〇元有成交，中間因拋紗人員到塲，正欲開始掛牌，人心轉軟，買氣極淡，喊一一〇〇〇〇元無人問津。嗣後拋紗工作遲遲木曾開始，於是市况急轉，行情上升，今日出高至一四二〇〇〇元收盤。</p>
<p>棉布昨紅盤漲勢勁烈，物價全面俏升，市勢承前茶會喊價，以高盤開做，雖有布疋重申限制南運之說，惟各方鑒於生產成本激增，一致看俏，四君子嗶嘰以四二〇〇元開盤，走勢盤堅，上升至四九〇〇元，而回小至四七五〇元午收。龍頭細布在五千元關口徘徊，中檔細布喇叭童及龍頭B細布，均以四千二百元收市，大雙龍細布，自三八五〇元升至四一〇〇元，實峯塔元嗶聲做四五〇〇元，較封關前市價均軋堅一倍半之譜。士林布叩萬元大關，民營廠盤紛紛調整，開出者尚屬不多，畫面人心堅定，趨勢看俏。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Gan Jiehou Ordered to Come to Shanghai Again to Urge Yan Huiqing and Others to Go to Beiping; Shao Lizi Returned to Nanjing Yesterday and Immediately Visited Acting President Li to Talk; Beijing People's Delegation Left Qingdao and Flew North <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] Gan Jiehou flew to Shanghai again at 1 PM on the afternoon of the second. On the second, Acting President Li ordered him to urge Yan Huiqing and the other five to go to Beiping as soon as possible to promote peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our City News] Gan Jiehou arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon by plane from Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The peace envoy delegation of Yan Huiqing and the other five still had no new developments yesterday. According to Yan's words to reporters: Nanjing has not yet issued an order to depart. The five were entrusted to work for peace. The five envoys themselves generally do not have any problems. The main thing is to see whether the CCP will receive them. Regarding this question, the personal representatives of Acting President Li are currently making preliminary contacts. Once there is a clue, the departure date can be determined, but it is expected that it will be difficult to make the trip in the next three to five days. As for the rumors that the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation came to Shanghai to contact us, that is not the case. According to Zhang Shizhao's words to reporters: He was entrusted to work for peace, and his mind is like a blank sheet of paper. He does not have any preconceived notions. Therefore, if he goes to Beiping, whatever is written on the blank sheet of paper, he will bring it back and submit it to the authorities for reference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Our City News] Jiang Yong (one of the five representatives), who is preparing to go to Beiping in a private capacity to make contact with the CCP, denied yesterday the rumors that they would bring a concrete peace plan to conduct important negotiations with the CCP, and stated that the news reported that the delegation held a meeting on the morning of the second to assign duties was inaccurate. Jiang said: Their purpose is only to urge the CCP to quickly appoint representatives for peace talks and decide on the time and place for holding peace talks. There are no other tasks. Regarding the five representatives, it is reported that Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Yan Huiqing are eager to work for peace and have no problems. Yan is old and frail and will invite a doctor to accompany him. Chen Guangfu is still considering it and generally has no problems. Only Leng Yuqiu, Speaker of the Jiangsu Provincial Council, is unsure whether he can get away to go to Beiping because the Provincial Council is about to hold a meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] Shao Lizi flew from Shanghai to Nanjing on a China Aviation plane at 10:10 AM on the second. After taking a short rest at his residence, he went to visit Acting President Li for talks. The content is unknown. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by President Yu of the Supervisory Yuan. According to Shao's words to reporters, Yan Huiqing and others had invited him to go to Beiping first. He has not yet made a definite reply, but if he goes with Yan and others, it will be temporarily in a personal capacity, not as a government representative to formally negotiate with the Communists.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing Second Dispatch] The government is now waiting for the CCP to designate its peace representatives and decide on the time and place for peace talks. It is generally hoped that this will be realized in the near future, possibly within this week, because the Communist army has entered Beiping and completely occupied the urban area. In the past, it was generally believed that the military occupation of Beiping was the CCP's so-called "complete liberation of Beiping."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Qingdao Second Dispatch] Qiu Zhizhong and others of the Beijing People's Peace Delegation flew from Nanjing to Beiping on the first. Because the Beiping airport was unable to be contacted during the transition period, they landed in Qingdao midway at 5 PM. They left on the morning of the second.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Qingdao Second Dispatch] Qiu Zhizhong, head of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, and delegation members Wu Yuhao, Deng Jiyu, Zeng Zisheng, Mo Guoshu, and Xia Yuanzhi, along with eight people and 16 accompanying reporters, flew from Nanjing to here on a special plane at 5 PM on the afternoon of the first. Because it was too late, they stayed in Qingdao overnight and flew to Beiping from Cang kou Airport on the afternoon of the second. It is said that the delegation will stay in Beiping for about two days and return to Nanjing on the fourth.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Government Seeks Peace, Its Sincerity Has Always Been Consistent; Responsible Leaders Can Return to Nanjing from Guangzhou at Any Time <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Our City News] Recently, there has been much speculation about the government's move to the south, with various rumors circulating. Our agency reporter specifically visited the government spokesperson, who told us the following:</p>
<p>The government seeks peace with the greatest sincerity, consistently and tirelessly. The Executive Yuan meeting on January 19 decided: "The CCP and the government are willing to cease fire unconditionally first and appoint representatives to conduct peace talks." This shows that the government has further advocated peace in order to respect the wishes of the people of the whole country and has proven the government's sincerity in hoping to achieve peace as soon as possible. However, according to the Xinhua News Agency's broadcast on the evening of the 21st, the CCP spokesperson said that this proposal was closing the door to peace and accused the government of being unwilling to send representatives to discuss specific methods for stopping the war. The government's enthusiasm for peace was not diminished by this. On the 22nd, the government appointed representatives and waited for the CCP to propose a date and place for negotiations. The CCP's response was that the Communist army was advancing steadily and there was no sign of ceasing operations. Although the government leaders sincerely hoped for peace, they could not sit idly by and be coerced for half a year. Therefore, the Executive Yuan's 41st meeting on January 26 resolved that the government would move to Guangzhou and begin working in Guangzhou on February 5. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally notified the embassies of various countries and asked them to move south together. Acting President Li came to Shanghai on January 31 and convened a meeting with the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan who were passing through Shanghai to Guangzhou. It was decided that the government would continue to devote itself to the pursuit of peace with the utmost sincerity in order to eliminate the scourge of war and relieve the suffering of the people as soon as possible. After the government moves to Guangzhou, responsible leaders can return to Nanjing at any time to continue to work towards the realization of peace talks.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Large Detachment of Communist Cavalry Continues to Enter Beiping <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Beijing Hotel Has Been Taken Over; Gold Yuan Notes Have Started to Be Exchanged</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Second Dispatch] The Beiping People's Government started working on the second. This institution was founded a month ago and its headquarters are in Shijiazhuang. The new institution is under the jurisdiction of Ye Jianying, who thus became the mayor.</p>
<p>[Also Electric] Communist troops continued to enter Beiping on the second, including a large detachment of cavalry that entered along Yongdingmen Avenue. Most of the cavalry rode good Japanese horses, while others rode strong Mongolian horses.</p>
<p>[Also Electric] The Communist army took over the Beijing Hotel, the bustling center of the ancient capital, on the second. The hotel is a six-story building that overlooks Dongjiaominxiang and is the tallest building in Beiping. The Communists intend to use it as a military hotel. The guests in the hotel rooms have been ordered to move out.</p>
<p>[Also Electric] The Military Management Committee announced on the second that the Renminbi is the legal basic currency in Beiping. Gold Yuan notes should be banned immediately, but for the convenience of the public, they are allowed to continue to circulate for 20 days. Starting from February 2, workers, students, factory workers, and the poor can exchange Gold Yuan notes for Renminbi at a rate of three to one, up to 300 yuan. Amounts exceeding this will be exchanged at the ordinary exchange rate. The ordinary exchange rate will be set later. Moving Gold Yuan notes out of the Beiping area requires special permission.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Beiping Second Dispatch] General Ye Jianying entered the city in the dark on the evening of the first, rather than with a triumphal entry as everyone had speculated. It is reported that the Beiping "Temporary Mixed Committee" met in the city on the second, but there is still no real news about what was discussed. One of the most likely issues discussed was the currency system. The currency system is still in a state of chaos.

<h3 id="e6">Spokesperson of the Capital Garrison Headquarters Talks, Emphasizing Overall Peace; Yangtze River Defense is Solid; Martial Law is Strengthened in Areas Close to the War Zone <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] At a press conference held by the Capital Garrison Headquarters on the morning of the second, Luo Chunbo, Director of the Political Warfare Department and spokesperson of the headquarters, said regarding martial law: Although Acting President Li ordered the lifting of martial law, exceptions were made for areas close to the war zone. Therefore, martial law is still enforced along the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Especially in the capital, where public security is important, the headquarters is responsible for strengthening its implementation. Luo also formally refuted the rumors about "partial peace" in Nanjing and Shanghai. He said: Wang Yidong, who claims to be a representative of Li Jishen, used to be the executive director of the pawnshop industry association and is now everywhere flaunting and inciting so-called partial peace. He emphasized that the peace that the government is sincerely striving for is overall peace, equal peace. In order to achieve peace, the national army has withdrawn south from the Huaihe River line to the final Yangtze River defense line. It is not that they cannot fight, but to show the government's sincerity and determination to seek peace. If the Communist army attempts to cross the river and continue to attack, the national army will counterattack. The Yangtze River is a natural barrier, and the capital is stable. The talk of partial peace is ridiculous.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] Yi Peixun, Director of the Third Department of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, reported on the war situation in Jiangbei at a press conference on the second, saying: The current situation is extremely stable. As of now, there are no signs that the Communist army intends to cross the river immediately. Although the national army has taken the initiative to withdraw from some areas, only local Communists are active in these areas. The main force of the Communist army urgently needs to be reorganized after the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign. The national army on the Yangtze River line is strong and the river defense is solid. There is no need to worry about the defense along the Nanjing-Shanghai line.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing Second Dispatch] Acting President Li convened a meeting of generals above the division commander level on the first and instructed them to remain in their original defenses and continue to prepare for war, pending the outcome of the peace talks. According to people close to Acting President Li, the government's policy is to do everything possible to reach a peaceful solution with the Communist Party, but "if the Communist army attempts to cross the river, they will be repelled." A military spokesperson on the second absolutely denied the news from a certain foreign news agency (not the Associated Press) that "the national army will abandon the Yangtze River defense line, Shanghai, and Nanjing and defend the line from Hangzhou to Hankou if the peace talks fail."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Puzhen Second Dispatch] The southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway remained calm on the second with no fighting. The national and communist armies are still facing each other north and south of Wuyi Town.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] According to a spokesperson for the Capital Garrison Headquarters, Yizheng City is indeed still held by the national army. Although Liuhe City has been abandoned, the Liuhe County government continues to operate somewhere within the county. The situation was tense at the end of last month, and there were rumors that three or four hundred local Communists were attempting to cross the river, but it has been learned that these were all false rumors. Furthermore, Jiangpu and Chaoxian are also still firmly held by the national army.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] Legislators remaining in Nanjing, including Lu Yuwen, Fan Yushui, Luo Mengce, Wang Hongshao, Rong Zhao, and Li Feng, wrote jointly to Executive Yuan President Sun on the second, pointing out that the Executive Yuan had only decided to relocate part of the ministries and commissions to Guangzhou for office work, which did not affect Nanjing's position as the political center. They asked Sun to convey that the leaders of the ministries and commissions should still return to Nanjing, and the Executive Yuan meetings should continue to be held in Nanjing to make decisions on political affairs and seek peace. The fourteen legislators have also sent their letters to Legislative Yuan President Tong and Acting President Li and asked Acting President Li to preside over the matter so that Executive Yuan meetings can still be held in Nanjing to reassure the public and benefit peace.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] Chen Kewen, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, took a night train to Shanghai on the second. In addition to carrying the letter from the fourteen legislators in Nanjing to Executive Yuan President Sun, he also carried President Tong's order to contact legislators in Shanghai and Hangzhou to inquire about their opinions on the location of the third session. It is reported that there are currently about 30 legislators remaining in Nanjing. They all believe that the Legislative Yuan should still reconvene in Nanjing. They have expressed this intention to President Tong, but whether this can become a reality depends on the evolution of the situation and the public opinion of legislators in various places.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Second Dispatch] According to the Constitution, the third session of the Legislative Yuan should convene this month. The government has now moved to Guangdong. Whether the Legislative Yuan will convene in Guangdong and when it can convene are matters of great concern to society. Yesterday, the reporter asked President Tong Guanxian, who told us the following: The government is now partially working in Guangdong and has not clearly ordered the relocation of the capital. The political center is still in Nanjing. As for the Legislative Yuan convening, the legislators are legally required to convene automatically. Where it will convene and when it will convene in the future will depend on the opinions of the majority of the legislators and the situation of the overall situation. Although this Yuan has dispatched personnel to Guangzhou to make necessary preparations, it is only a preparation for emergencies.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Qingdao Second Dispatch] Vice Admiral Badger, commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, revealed on the second that he will sail to Shanghai within two weeks on the flagship USS Eldorado. When the flagship leaves Qingdao, the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet will also move away at the same time.</p>
<p>He made it clear that regardless of whether the flagship sails to Shanghai, Hong Kong, or any Chinese seaport, the Western Pacific Fleet will continue to carry out the State Department's mission of protecting American citizens and major assets. He reiterated that this is a policy that the United States has already decided on and has not changed in the current situation.</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Badger told the Associated Press reporter alone on the flagship: The changing situation in Qingdao and other coastal areas of China may lead to some adjustments to the Navy and Marine Corps under his command, but based on the position of national interests, he refused to provide detailed figures on personnel transfers and reductions, but he pointed out: The Marines currently stationed on ships anchored in Qingdao may be transferred to Shanghai to replace the Marines stationed on the Pfeiffert in Shanghai, and some may be sent back to Guam, the Ryukyu Islands, and other Pacific regions, because the normal service equipment there is much better than Qingdao. He said: "Qingdao is an ideal place for us, but now that the evacuation of American citizens has been completed, the need for naval service no longer exists. We are making adjustments to suit the needs of the situation. We will still leave some military force in Qingdao, but only enough to perform the tasks we are responsible for. The excess personnel will be transferred to places with better training facilities, and we will maintain a patrol team on land in Qingdao."</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington First Dispatch] The State Department refused to comment on the first whether the US naval strike team stationed in Qingdao is preparing to withdraw due to increased military pressure on the city from the Communist and national armies. Any information will be released by Vice Admiral Badger. The National Defense Security Council has authorized Badger to withdraw the Marines stationed in Qingdao in an emergency. Although there is a lack of information here about the future plans of the Marines, it is speculated that they will not stay in Qingdao, which is surrounded by the Communist army, for long.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanchang Second Dispatch] After the Communist Party reported the military situation in Jiangbei and the provincial government's relocation and other news based on a report from a Hangzhou newspaper reporter stationed in Jiangxi, the provincial government denied it and investigated the source of the news. According to the information obtained by our newspaper reporter from the authorities on the second, it has been confirmed that Huangmei, Guangji, and other cities in Jiangbei are still held by the national army. Only Zhang Tixue and other local Communists are stepping up their conscription of troops and food in the area north of the county seat. Judging from the current situation, there is no sign of a southward invasion. Since a certain army was dispatched to Southern Jiangxi, the river defense has been strengthened. A certain commander will be stationed in Jiujiang. The Jiangbei and Northern Jiangxi areas are now tranquil, and the Jiangxi Security Corps still has local troops stationed on the Jiangbei front line.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou First Dispatch] Since the national army withdrew to the south, many troops have stayed in Hangzhou.

<h3 id="e15">The Frustration of Statesmanship <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— February 2nd, Editorial from the English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao"</p>
<p>On January 24th, we published a jubilant editorial entitled "The Best News So Far." At the time of writing that editorial, Acting President Li had just announced a number of decisive reform measures, and the Chinese Communists had also issued peace terms from Beiping that appeared to be quite lenient.</p>
<p>These two things combined offered China a real opportunity. Although many disappointing events have occurred in the past few days, we still feel that our claim at that time was correct.</p>
<p>Following the aforementioned editorial on January 24th, we also published another editorial on the same day, entitled: "The Time to Show Statesmanship." At the time, no one seemed to pay attention to this second editorial, and now it seems that everyone has completely forgotten it. However, this one should have been given attention along with the previous one. China has faced a good opportunity – but statesmanship is simply nowhere to be seen. As a result, as things stand, this good opportunity is rapidly fading away.</p>
<p>On January 24th, we thought that perhaps Vice President Li had already consulted with the Chinese Communists while President Chiang was still in office. On this point, we seem to have been completely wrong. Not only is there no sign of prior consultation, but every hour of delay has undermined any opportunity for negotiation. The disintegration of the National Government (original text – translator) is accelerating, and this disintegration, after a considerable period, may make the peace that Li and his confidants can achieve only of a partial nature, not a national one.</p>
<p>To Chinese people accustomed to domestic division, this development may not be a terrible disaster, but it is certainly not worthy of statesmanship.</p>
<p>When Li took power, he assumed the position of the "de facto" leader of a "de jure" government. What we mean is that although President Chiang only "withdrew," and in reality, still seemed to be remotely directing affairs, the power taken over by Li was diplomatically recognized by the world powers and had representatives in the United Nations organization. Even if this regime was bogged down and suffering setbacks, it was still legitimate. However, after Li took over, his subordinates did not cooperate to realize his reform measures, and some military commanders apparently refused to accept orders, so their troops quickly moved away. From these places, it seems that Li has not been able to fully control the institution. However, in the eyes of the world, Li is now the leader of a generally recognized Chinese government, so if the Chinese Communists can quickly sign a peace treaty with him now, it would be in the interest of the Chinese Communists, also in Li's interest, and also beneficial to China, because any agreement and unification would be better than all the situations that have occurred in the past or may occur in the future.</p>
<p>As things stand now, we don't think Li is wrong. The mistake was made by the Chinese Communists, and perhaps they deliberately made this mistake. If this is indeed the case, we think their vision is too short-sighted. This mistake will cause China to encounter a longer period of struggle before any signs of unification can be obtained, and the people will suffer for a longer period of time – and causing the people to suffer is completely contrary to the claims that the Chinese Communists have always advocated.</p>
<p>Perhaps their reason for doing so is to obtain unconditional surrender, and they believe that a partial unconditional surrender is more beneficial than negotiating peace with the government represented by Li—because after negotiating peace with the government, it is necessary to immediately eliminate uncooperative elements. However, these uncooperative elements, which may even include President Chiang himself, can be called rebels, and the Chinese Communists themselves have long been given this title.</p>
<p>Other than that, we really don't understand why there is such a lack of statesmanship in insisting on handing over war criminals. In the past, when President Roosevelt faced this situation in the war against Japan, his attitude was exactly the opposite of that of the Chinese Communists; admittedly, he also demanded unconditional surrender, but he never made a big fuss about the war crimes issue first, and he especially exempted the head of state from the war crimes punishment, because Emperor Hirohito assisted in the surrender. Li should of course receive this treatment immediately, and if Chiang Kai-shek's name can be permanently removed from this list, it will definitely receive the support of the people of the whole country. Mayor Wu of Shanghai should not be included in this list at all. In fact, since international law does not apply in civil wars, the entire idea of punishing "war criminals" is untenable.</p>
<p>It is not too late to clean up now. However, in such events, time will quickly disappear. Soon, the opposition within the Kuomintang may make any peace that Li can achieve as localized as Chuan Zuoyi's peace. In this way, various difficulties will be prolonged, and it will also cause many unnecessary or even malicious diplomatic recognition issues. In short, everything will be messed up. We are not as happy as we used to be. More and more important people in Chinese history have the same feeling, and undoubtedly they feel it more deeply than we do.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e16">Starting with Stalin's Peace Posture <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Stalin recently answered questions from a reporter from the American International News Service and put forward four opinions on current world problems: (1) The Soviet government is prepared to consider issuing a joint declaration with the US government stating that neither the US nor the Soviet government has any intention of resorting to force; (2) The Soviet government is clearly cooperating with the United States to implement this non-war treaty and leading countries to gradually reduce armaments; (3) If the governments of Britain, the United States, and France can agree to temporarily suspend the establishment of a West German government and wait for a meeting of foreign ministers to review the entire German issue, then the Soviet government is willing to lift its blockade of Berlin, provided that the governments of Britain, the United States, and France also lift their restrictions on transportation and trade at the same time; (4) I have repeatedly stated that I am willing to meet with President Truman to directly discuss the possibility of this peace treaty.</p>
<p>These four opinions can be said to be Stalin's new peace posture. Regardless of whether Stalin's remarks can become a reality, in today's suffocatingly low international atmosphere, they are still a glimmer of light in the darkness, and to peace-loving people around the world, they feel like exciting tidings of peace. Therefore, diplomatic figures in London and Washington heard Stalin's statement and rekindled hopes for world peace, which had reached an impasse. However, the reaction of the British and American governments was not as enthusiastic as ideal.</p>
<p>Washington was not only very cold, but also believed that Stalin's statement was a kind of "peace offensive" to divert the attention of Western countries that are currently focused on the North Atlantic Treaty. President Truman read the full text of Stalin's statement and did not comment on it. His secretary, Ross, told the press that President Truman had repeatedly stated that Stalin was welcome to come to Washington at any time and that he would be willing to talk to him. However, diplomatic figures in general hope that the Soviet Union can show concrete actions after displaying its new peace posture.</p>
<p>In Britain, diplomatic figures were very shocked by Stalin's new peace posture, but the Foreign Office remained indifferent. According to a Foreign Office spokesperson, Britain will consult with the United States and France on Stalin's remarks to study the possibility of improved relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, before Stalin made his remarks, the Soviet Foreign Ministry published a white paper fiercely attacking the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty, accusing Britain and the United States of moving towards a new international war. Based on this, it is clear that Britain cannot fully trust Stalin's true intentions.</p>
<p>Looking back at international politics since the end of World War II, it is not difficult to prove that the crux of today's international problems lies in the irreconcilable differences between the United States and the Soviet Union. If these two world powers can reconcile and repair their relationship, then all current international problems, whether European or Asian, may be solved easily. Based on this view, we believe that if the world is to achieve true peace, it is necessary to first seek understanding and coordination between the United States and the Soviet Union. Any actions that can truly promote improved relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, no matter where they originate, are welcomed by us peace-loving people. I remember that the Soviet Embassy in the United States published an article in mid-last month advocating "mutual understanding to promote friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union." At that time, we attached great importance to it and hoped that it could become an opportunity for a change in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, the US attitude was cold, and it burst like a soap bubble. Acting Secretary of State Lovett also expressed welcome to the Soviet Union's peaceful intentions at the time, but still insisted that the Soviet Union should show concrete actions to prove its sincerity for peace. Now, although the US Secretary of State has changed, the US attitude towards the Soviet Union remains the same. For this reason, the hope for peace sparked by Stalin's remarks may also disappear like a soap bubble.</p>
<p>Standing in the position of a third party, observing US-Soviet relations, whether in terms of ideology or interests, they are in opposite positions. Today, if we want the two countries to improve their relations, dispel suspicions, and reconcile, it cannot be achieved overnight. However, the opportunity to improve Soviet-American relations, like other opportunities, is fleeting. Now that there is a new brewing in the international community, the United States and the Soviet Union should especially cherish this good opportunity. On Stalin's side, now that he has displayed a new peace posture, he should show more concrete actions to prove that he is truly sincere; and on the American side, it should also seize the opportunity to eliminate the hostility between the two countries and reverse the adverse currents in the international community.</p>
<p>However, President Truman said during the campaign, "We all need peace," so why can't he wholeheartedly embrace Stalin's suggestion at this time and meet in a certain place immediately? And why do American diplomatic circles hope that the Soviet Union can show significant concrete actions? In a word, judging from the actions of the Communist International, the United States cannot easily believe in the sincerity of the Soviet Union's peace overtures. By analogy, China hopes that they will have some concrete actions, and not just a "command" posture in the broadcast. What are the concrete actions? First of all, both sides agree to an immediate ceasefire!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou 2nd Dispatch] After the Wuhan Garrison Command submitted a request to the Central China authorities for the promulgation of four emergency punishment measures to severely punish those who create rumors and cause trouble, a large number of officers were dispatched today to resolutely take action. Tan Jialiang and Wu Ying, the ringleaders who deliberately made alarmist remarks and gathered crowds to rob rice, were escorted through the city at 3 p.m. and executed by firing squad. Nine accomplices were tied up at the execution ground as a warning. In addition, many silver dealers who created a black market for gold and silver will also be sentenced to death. For a time, the crowd watched in droves, and the people were overjoyed. The black market price of silver dollars has fallen from 1,400 yuan to 600 yuan, but commodity prices have not yet fallen. Cooked rice is as high as 12,000 yuan. The authorities are now taking the same sanctions against unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou 2nd Dispatch] Today, the public security authorities arrested more than 50 black market dealers, including Zhou Yihua, and will choose the most serious offenders to be tied up and executed by firing squad at the Tongyi Street silver dollar black market trading place.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou 2nd Dispatch] Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi and Garrison Commander Chen Mingren jointly hosted a reception for reporters on the evening of the 1st. Bai's main points were: (1) As long as peace is not hopeless, we should continue to work hard for peace, but soldiers must defend their territory and cannot forget war because of peace. We had to prepare in the past, and we must prepare even more today. (2) Peace cannot be sought on one side. If there is war in the future, the responsibility lies entirely with the Chinese Communists. (3) In order to crack down on bizarre rumors and prevent disruptive behavior, the public security authorities have promulgated emergency measures, which will be implemented immediately. (4) The military and police live a hard life. It has been decided to issue silver dollars for food expenses immediately. In addition to raising funds from the central institutions here, the industrial and commercial circles of Wuhan have also enthusiastically supported this. With such unity of purpose, I am confident that we will be able to overcome the difficulties, and I am very pleased. (5) In Central China, the National Army in western Anhui, eastern Hubei, southern Henan, northern Hubei, and western Hubei is still firmly defending its original positions and has not advanced. It is also announced that the local Communists near Queshan have been eliminated, and Queshan Xinyang will soon be open to traffic. (6) The media should promote justice, distinguish right from wrong, and I respect freedom of speech. I hope you will conduct your own checks and not let others check you. After Bai finished speaking, Commander Chen announced the emergency measures: (1) Those who rob property in groups will be killed. (2) Those who spread rumors and disrupt public order will be killed. (3) Those who engage in black market activities and disrupt the currency system will be killed. Chen also said: Killing people to save people is compassion, not cruelty. Our purpose is to maintain order, so we only kill bad people and never kill good people. In addition, Commander-in-Chief Bai expressed his approval of Hunan Province's issuance of silver-based subsidiary coins and ordered the Political Committee to invite financial circles and experts to form a seven-member group to announce reasonable and effective measures as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Washington 1st Dispatch] Democratic Senator McCarran, Chairman of the US Congressional Oversight Committee on Foreign Aid, today denounced Stalin's "peace movement" as one of his old tricks, attempting to divert American attention from the Communist gains in China. McCarran proposed a $1.5 billion economic and military aid to China plan on the 31st and issued a statement today stating that Stalin's new offensive shows that a realistic US aid to China plan should be passed as soon as possible, because "this move is related to the safety of Asia." He also warned that in order to prevent China from falling to Communist conquest, aid to China is urgently needed, and if the United States wants to achieve President Truman's goal of assisting backward countries, which he announced in his inaugural address, then "We must maintain a "firm foothold" in China." If we do nothing in China, our position will be determined by others. If it is unfortunate, the master of that decision is undoubtedly the Chinese Communists. Also, if we do not provide China with assistance today, and know that the assistance can save the Chinese government from complete disintegration, then we will lose some resources in the future. The resources are not only necessary for the national defense of the United States, but also necessary for our way of life. So far, McCarran has not drafted his aid to China plan and sent it to Congress to be passed into law. He told a reporter from the Central News Agency that he will submit it this month and is waiting for the government's response.</p>
<p>[US Information Service Washington 1st Dispatch] The State Department recently announced that as of last Friday, under the $122.5 million additional aid to China plan, $122,977,994.27 has been paid out. The figure announced on the 1st was $257,020 more than last week. The 80th Congress appropriated a total of $400 million to aid China, limited to the end of April 1949. Of this amount, $275 million is purely economic aid, which is implemented by the Economic Cooperation Administration. The remaining $122.5 million is additional aid, which is designated by the Chinese government for the purchase of military supplies.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Extraordinary Results in Promoting Benefits and Eliminating Evils: The Achievements of the Female Magistrate of Xifeng County - A Dispatch from Guiyang, January 26 <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>Xu Fangyuan, the female magistrate of Xifeng County, had only been in office for a short time last summer when Gu Zhenglun, known for his emphasis on law, practicality, and lack of levity, returned to Guizhou to take charge. At the time, everyone assumed she would likely be replaced. However, she managed to hold onto her position and even seemed to have "quite a reputation for effective governance."</p>
<p>After taking office as the provincial chairman, Gu Zhenglun met with county magistrates in batches. When Magistrate Xu paid her respects to the chairman, the attendants mistook her for Magistrate Xu's wife and asked Gu Zhenglun whether or not to grant her an audience. This became a well-known anecdote. Because she had received higher education and engaged in women's movements for many years, she relied on her persuasive skills to discuss everything from local grassroots politics to her life aspirations. It is said that her initial audience with Chairman Gu lasted about two hours, exceeding the speaking time of any other county magistrate. Gu had a "very good impression" of her, and her position as county magistrate was thus secured.</p>
<p>Unanimous Praise from All Quarters</p>
<p>In winter, Lü Chao, a supervisor from the Supervisory Yuan's Guizhou Supervisory Committee, came to Guizhou for inspection. He spent a week in Xifeng, inspecting the work of the female magistrate. After returning to Guiyang and Kunming, he repeatedly praised her verbally to newspaper reporters, and newspapers published articles praising her. Recently, the Guizhou Provincial Government's year-end county administration inspection team set out in different directions to inspect the administration of various counties. Xie Boyuan, director of the Provincial Food Bureau, who was responsible for inspecting Xifeng County's administration, reported back to the province, highly commending Xifeng County's administration, especially its food administration and conscription. The Provincial Military Control Area Headquarters also believed that she was able to comply with laws and regulations and complete tasks legally and on time, giving her a major commendation. After these several "praises" and "evaluations," the female magistrate not only secured her position but also "rose to prominence."</p>
<p>This reporter recently conducted a personal inspection of Xifeng's administration. From the Provincial Government's year-end county administration inspection team and the Military Control Area's conscription inspection personnel, I obtained considerable information about the female magistrate's administration. Coincidentally, yesterday (the 25th), I met the female magistrate herself at the provincial government while she was returning to the province for "both official and private" duties. Because the Lunar New Year was only three days away, the female magistrate requested a week's leave from the provincial government to return to the province for a family reunion. Yesterday, she spoke with the reporter at length about her "sense of reassurance," showing a sense of accomplishment. The facts prove that the female magistrate is indeed different from male magistrates.</p>
<p>According to the female magistrate's response to the reporter, what policy implementation has been most effective since taking office? After a brief consideration, she said frankly, "In Xifeng, I have been striving to implement the chairman's will to reduce the burden on the people, earnestly promote benefits, and eliminate evils. Due to limited financial and human resources, I dare not claim any achievements in policy implementation, but I have indeed made some gains in reducing the people's burden and promoting benefits and eliminating evils. I have personally witnessed it, and it can be said that I have some sense of reassurance." She then recited the theory from "Chairman Gu's Collected Sayings," which she had memorized thoroughly, to the reporter. She said that in the less than ten months since taking office, she had completely visited all seventeen townships in the county once, and every month, she also made special inspections to various townships in different directions, each lasting about a week, to personally see the difficult lives of the people. She pointed to her light gray tweed jacket and cotton cloth trousers and told the reporter, "I only changed into this tweed jacket when I came to the province. In the county, I usually ride a horse to inspect various townships." She replied that she rides her horse very well, traversing mountains and valleys with ease. The female magistrate's body was originally very healthy, and the training of the past nine months has made her even stronger.</p>
<p>Three Key Policies: Food, Conscription, and Salt</p>
<p>She talked the most about Xifeng's food administration. Regarding public grain, she absolutely prohibited the practice of selling it at a low price under false pretenses and then depositing the money into the treasury, while in reality, private individuals bought it and sold it at a high price for personal gain. She said that this kind of "low-price sale and requisition" benefited private individuals at the expense of the public, which she would not allow. Secondly, she strictly prohibited reporting inflated collection figures to superiors and collecting late fees and fines from subordinates, and then using these late fees as "private burdens" for food officials. She said that the collection of land taxes in Xifeng has now truly reached 90%, which can be confirmed by Director Xie of the Provincial Food Bureau. Chairman Gu does not allow land tax officials in various counties to collect taxes under false names and requires the people to assess and collect taxes themselves. The remaining grain underground should be allowed to be disposed of by the people. When she strictly implemented this in Xifeng, the people who delivered grain all praised Chairman Gu endlessly.</p>
<p>After the female magistrate finished talking about how she handled conscription reasonably and legally, conducting open lotteries and strictly prohibiting substitutions, I asked her whether the method of collecting two liters of rice per household per month for self-defense, collected three months at a time, could be said to reduce the burden on the people. She thought for a moment before replying to the reporter, "Xifeng has not yet started collecting it. Collecting two liters of rice per household per month, collected three months at a time, may be difficult. It would be best if it could be determined according to the tax amount, with those who have more money contributing more and those who have less money contributing less, to be fair and reasonable." She indicated that this must be decided by the provincial government, and Xifeng did not dare to make its own decision.</p>
<p>When the reporter talked to her about the abuses of salt administration, she said, "There are no more abuses in Xifeng's salt administration. All that exists is a shortage of quotas." She absolutely prohibits collusion between officials and merchants to profit from salt. Every month, she requires the Salt Industry Association to supervise the wholesale merchants to transport the salt to the county within the specified time and quantity, report the accounts publicly, and then distribute it to various townships, selling it to the people at the prescribed price, and registering it for future verification to check the salt transportation and sales situation from the county to the townships. She said that she had partnered with someone to do salt business in the past and knew that there were many abuses, but since becoming the county magistrate, she had never been involved and had dismissed an official in the county government who held an important position because he was suspected of colluding with salt merchants to do business.</p>
<p>Promoting Education and Growing American Tobacco</p>
<p>Next, the female magistrate talked about her policies for promoting benefits. Xifeng's education, such as township and village national schools, only emphasized quantitative development in the past, forgetting qualitative improvement, especially the funding for education, which was the biggest problem. After taking office, she significantly reduced the number of village national schools, reducing the 54 village national schools in the county's seventeen townships after weighing the pros and cons and concentrating financial and human resources to operate the remaining 27 schools. Because the dispute over temple property being donated as school property had never been resolved over the years, she held a county-wide Buddhist conference, publicly reducing and exempting all donations from the temples, asking them to complete the procedures for the temple property that had already been donated according to their original intention, and inviting the heads of the temples that donated property to the County Education Funding Management Committee to jointly be responsible for safeguarding the property. At the same time, she also numbered and copied all the title deeds of the education property, sending them to the Provincial Department of Education and the County Council for record-keeping. The county's education funding was thus able to operate independently, and there was no need to worry about development in the future.</p>
<p>"Xifeng is too poor, and the people are struggling. When I took office, I advocated planting American tobacco. County government employees also had to participate in planting. At first, everyone was dissatisfied because the price of American tobacco was too low at that time." Magistrate Xu smiled and continued, "Soon, the price of American tobacco rose every day, and now it has reached 1,300 to 1,400 Gold Yuan per hundred catties, and the people are all overjoyed. The total production of American tobacco in the county was less than 50,000 catties last year, and this year it will be at least 300,000 catties. County government employees also harvested 4,000 to 5,000 catties, which I completely handed over to all employees for distribution as a reward for their labor." She also added that the people are short-sighted, and it is easier to eliminate evils, but it is really difficult to promote benefits. However, as long as the government has the determination, after the people receive some benefits, it will be easier to promote policies that benefit them in the future.</p>
<p>The Glory of the Women's World</p>
<p>The female magistrate has won the hearts of the people in Xifeng and has gained confidence in the province. Men have unanimously praised her both in person and behind her back, and especially the women's world feels even more glorious when they mention her. According to people close to the female magistrate, the problem is very simple: she not only does not want to mess with money but is also willing to lose money. Her political desires are very strong, and being a county magistrate is only the starting point of her political life. In addition, she is willing to work hard and is more willing to adopt the opinions of the people, so her position as county magistrate has been secured and has "risen to prominence"! Besides, her "husband," Sun Botao, is a landlord in Dading County and a wealthy man in Guiyang, and he respects her opinions very much.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Stalin Reiterates Willingness to Meet with Truman, but Avoids Long-Distance Flights on Doctor's Orders; Location in Eastern Europe at the Discretion of the United States <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 2nd: The full text of Stalin's original letter to Smith of the Paris branch of the American International News Service, as transmitted by a certain London telegraph agency, is as follows: "I am deeply grateful for Mr. Truman's invitation to me to go to Washington. I have long intended to go to Washington. I mentioned this intention to Mr. Roosevelt at Yalta, and I also mentioned it to Mr. Truman at Potsdam. Unfortunately, I am currently unable to fulfill this wish, as my doctor has formally warned me that I should no longer make long journeys, especially by air or sea. If Mr. Truman can come to the Soviet Union, the Soviet government would be most welcome. As for the meeting location, please choose one of the three locations: Kaliningrad, Odessa, or Yalta, at the President's discretion. However, if the aforementioned locations I suggested are not approved, then the President may also choose to explore Poland or Czechoslovakia. Sincerely, Stalin." According to the news agency, little is known about Stalin's health. He has indeed taken many long vacations since the end of the last war. However, foreign envoys who have seen Stalin said that he is energetic and quite healthy. In the recent photos of Stalin, his appearance is really no different from before, except that his temples are more gray. Today, Stalin's letter stated that he is not suitable for flying. Flying is especially unsuitable for patients with certain heart conditions and those with high blood pressure, but most doctors believe that sailing is actually beneficial to patients.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 2nd: White House Press Secretary Ross stated that President Truman had not received any invitation from Stalin suggesting what kind of talks he would like to have, and said that, as far as he knows, Truman's most recent statement on this suggestion was that he was willing to meet with Stalin in Washington. Ross stated that Truman only knew of Stalin's recent suggestion from broadcasts and newspapers. When a reporter asked if President Truman was willing to go to Poland or Czechoslovakia, Ross interrupted before the reporter could say the word "Soviet Union," replying, "No comment, that's all."</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 2nd: A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department stated that he had informally heard rumors of Stalin suggesting a meeting with Truman in the Soviet Union, Poland, or Czechoslovakia, but had no comment on the rumor. Three days ago, Stalin had stated his willingness to sign a "non-aggression" pact with the United States. According to radio reports, one noteworthy point in Stalin's recent statement is that Stalin did not mention locations behind the so-called "Iron Curtain" by Western countries as possible meeting places. Stalin's statement shows that he has no intention of leaving the Soviet-controlled area to discuss peace issues with Truman. The reaction in Washington and London to this statement is that Stalin is merely launching a "peace propaganda offensive." This statement allows Stalin to maintain a position that, if Truman refuses to accept the meeting suggestion, Stalin can announce to the world that the United States is unwilling to discuss peace. Secondly, if Truman accepts the suggestion, it forces Truman to hold talks within the Soviet-controlled area. Although there has been no official statement from London, there is fear that the Soviet Union's "peace offensive" may lead to bilateral talks without the participation of British representatives.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 2nd: State Department spokesperson McDermott revealed that no official report had been received regarding Stalin's recent statement, so he did not intend to make any comments for the time being. Washington believes that Stalin's new suggestion to meet with Truman at a time when the details of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are being drafted undoubtedly indicates that the Soviet Union intends to prevent the signing of the treaty. If the Soviet Union can achieve bilateral talks, it will inevitably cause suspicion and distrust of the United States among other Western countries such as Britain and France, and the Soviet Union will achieve a diplomatic victory.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Royal to Meet with Barr in Japan to Discuss Issues Related to China; U.S. Military Deployment in the Far East Not Expected to Increase <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal and his party arrived here yesterday. Today, they reviewed the U.S. occupation forces' First Cavalry Division at the Imperial Plaza. Royal, along with Eighth Army Commander Walker and Division Commander Chase, reviewed the troops from an armored vehicle. When Royal got out of the vehicle, he twisted his ankle and went to the Army Hospital for treatment. He left after twenty minutes.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 2nd] U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal told the press today that the United States currently has no plans to increase the number of troops in the Far East significantly. Although Royal emphasized that the China issue is not the main purpose of his trip, he admitted that the China issue is one of the issues he will be discussing. Royal, who came to Japan with China expert Wedemeyer, will meet with General Barr, the former head of the U.S. military advisory group in Nanjing. When reporters asked if he planned to transfer the Japanese occupation affairs to the U.S. State Department, as with the German occupation affairs, Royal avoided answering directly, but pointed out that his personal opinion is that the Army should return to its military duties and should not manage railways or provide relief. He also said, "I hope the Army will one day return to missions within the military scope." Royal continued to declare that the purpose of his visit to Japan was to understand issues within the military scope, and clarified that the main purpose of his visit was to inspect the U.S. defense operations in the Pacific, and not to deal with economic issues. He also said that Dodge, a banker from Diderick, who came with him, will serve as Mac's special economic advisor and stay in Japan to deal with economic issues. When reporters asked if he was carrying a new economic plan or new instructions from Washington to Mac, Royal replied, "No, I didn't bring a plan. I only brought 'budget and economic stability expert Dodge.'" When reporters asked what his opinion was on the increased power of the Japanese Communist Party in the recent general election results, Royal replied that the people of various countries do not support the left more than before, and even if this is the case, this is probably mostly due to the psychological state of the Far East.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 2nd] The Far East Headquarters announced on the 2nd that the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China will be temporarily located in Tokyo. The office is on the second floor of the Tokyo Imperial Building. The head of the group is Major General Barr, assisted by Rear Admiral Olt and Brigadier General Bilk. The Chief of Staff is Colonel Chamberlin.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 1st] Former Progressive Party presidential candidate Wallace said today, "For the first time in two years, Stalin has suggested that the United States and the Soviet Union should hold negotiations on various important issues. I am confident that the U.S. government will give a favorable response." Wallace continued, "Stalin has now reopened the door to negotiations, and the conscience of mankind requires that this door must be kept open forever. This is the best moment to hold peace talks to replace military alliances. At this moment, we should continue to move forward and not adopt suicidal policies. At the same time, we should use billions of dollars for military equipment and military alliances such as the Atlantic Treaty. These actions are only enough to cause a final conflict in which no one can win. We should accept Stalin's suggestion and start negotiations to resolve years of disputes." Wallace added that he believes that differences on the German issue can be resolved and insisted that Stalin and Truman should hold consultations before it is "too late."</p>

It stated: Norway will not enter into any agreement with other countries to provide bases for foreign troops unless it is attacked or threatened with aggression.</p>
<p>Norway had hoped that the United Nations would provide the necessary strength to maintain peace and security for all countries in the world, but this hope has not yet been realized. For its own security, Norway firmly believes that it is necessary to promote security through regional defense cooperation. The Norwegian government believes that this regional treaty is in accordance with the United Nations Charter and aims to prevent aggression. Norway will further study in what ways and conditions it may participate in the regional security system. Norway has a long-standing friendship with its neighbor, the Soviet Union, and firmly believes that the Soviet government will recognize Norway's peaceful intentions and its willingness to maintain friendship with all peace-loving countries. The Soviet Union had recently questioned Norway on whether it would join the future North Atlantic Treaty and whether it would provide military bases to Western countries. Semi-official sources said that Norway's reply was firm.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] The U.S. State Department expressed its satisfaction with Norway's decision today to join forces with the Atlantic countries despite Soviet pressure. The department announced that Norway and several other countries will soon be invited to participate in negotiations on the North Atlantic Mutual Defense Treaty. The State Department did not formally comment on Norway's reply to the Soviet Union. According to McDermott, director of the department's press bureau, "We hope to discuss the entire North Atlantic security issue with not only Norway but also other governments in the near future." Other well-informed sources said that Secretary of State Acheson may meet with the ambassadors of Canada, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Canada this week to discuss the draft treaty and decide to invite Norway, Iceland, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, and even Denmark to participate. The United States hopes that the treaty can be signed within a month and submitted to the Senate for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e38">The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in Eastern Europe is Shut Out; Yugoslavia Protests, Alleging that the Soviet Union's Actions Violate the Agreement <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 2nd] Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj declared to Tanjug News Agency today that the Yugoslav government had protested to the Soviet government and other countries convening the conference on cooperation and mutual assistance in Moscow because the Yugoslav government was not invited to participate in the conference, which clearly violated the existing agreements concluded by these countries with the Yugoslav government. However, Kardelj also said that if the current anti-Yugoslav movement stops, Yugoslavia will still participate in the Moscow conference based on the agreements reached at this conference. Kardelj explained that the Yugoslav government had not been informed in advance about the Moscow consultations and had not been invited to participate. He added that the Yugoslav government was quite surprised by this move because Yugoslavia had repeatedly suggested maintaining closer economic cooperation and mutual assistance with various people's democratic countries, while these countries also had mutual assistance and cooperation treaties with Yugoslavia in various aspects. He also said that Yugoslavia would undoubtedly abide by these treaties. After expressing satisfaction that all countries could participate on an equal footing in the resolutions reached at the Moscow conference, Kardelj said that Yugoslavia was prepared to participate based on these conditions. He announced that Yugoslavia had notified this attitude to Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] According to well-informed sources, the four-power conference to discuss the Austrian peace treaty has decided to postpone the meeting until the 9th of this month at the request of the Soviet Union.

It is believed that Zarubin will represent the Soviet Union in the meeting. The representatives of the Western countries will be Majoriebank for the United Kingdom, Reber for the United States, and Besseirat for France.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal said today that the strength of the U.S. Air Force may become the most powerful force in the world in the next five or six years, just as the British Navy once held a position in the world. Before that time, in the event of a war, our army, navy, and air force will still have to be mixed. I especially support the establishment of 70 peacetime air groups.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] Forrestal revealed on the 1st that the Army, Navy, and Air Force requested $30 billion in the 1950 budget last summer. This amount was proposed last summer when the Berlin blockade and the Czech coup turned the Cold War into a spark of fire. He declared at a national press lunch that it had been reduced to $16.9 billion before being submitted to the Bureau of the Budget, and President Truman had reduced it to $14.4 billion. Forrestal also revealed that General Eisenhower is studying the system of training Army, Navy, and Air Force officers in order to end inter-service competition and complete unification.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union Requests Postponement of the Disarmament Debate</p>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, Lake Success, 1st] Jiang Tingfu has taken office as the Chairman of the Security Council for February, succeeding Canadian McNaughton. In accordance with the principle of alphabetical order, the new chairmen of other groups within the Security Council, such as the Military Staff Committee, the Atomic Energy Committee, and the Old-fashioned Armaments Committee, also took office today.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 2nd] Soviet delegation leader Malik requested Security Council Chairman Jiang Tingfu to postpone the debate on the disarmament issue for a week. This is the third time the Soviet Union has requested a postponement of the debate, which some sources at the United Nations believe is related to the new spirit of Soviet policy. The same sources believe that Malik's new attitude may be due to his uncertainty about any changes in the Soviet Union's attitude on the basic issue of disarmament.</p>

<p>Soviet Opposition Inevitable During Security Council Discussions</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Broadcast from Lake Success, New York, 2nd: The South Korean Foreign Minister formally applied to United Nations Secretary-General Lie to allow South Korea to join the United Nations organization. When this application is submitted to the Security Council for discussion, it seems inevitable that it will be vetoed by the Soviet Union. The South Korean government has been recognized by the United Nations General Assembly as the legitimate government and has received diplomatic recognition from Britain, the United States, and the Philippines. However, the Soviet Union claims that the communist government of North Korea is the only legitimate government, so the Soviet Union may prevent South Korea from joining the United Nations.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 2nd] The Dutch official gazette denies rumors that a major change in Dutch policy towards Indonesia is about to occur. The gazette mentions the declaration of the Dutch representative to the Security Council, Van Royen, and reiterates that some points in the Security Council resolution are unacceptable and cannot be implemented by the Netherlands. The gazette further states: The Indonesian Federation and the Netherlands have been able to establish a truly constructive common front for policy. The actions being implemented immediately in Batavia are to establish the legal status between the Netherlands and all of Indonesia, to which the Netherlands has given the greatest attention. The Netherlands does not consider transferring part of its sovereignty to the Security Council, neither now nor in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Satisfactory Results of National-Communist Postal Service; Postal Administration Sends Urgent Telegrams to Various Regions Ordering Trial Implementation Based on Local Conditions <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the trial implementation of the National-Communist postal service by the Shanghai Postal Administration, initial results have been satisfactory. It has been learned that the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications has sent urgent telegrams to the postal administrations of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Hubei, and Shanxi provinces, ordering them to find ways to implement postal services locally. At the same time, it also issued a notice to postal employees in areas where war breaks out, allowing them to temporarily seek refuge in nearby safe locations, and to return to their original locations and resume operations when there is no danger to life, and to communicate with various places. As for the methods of communication, the situation in each district is different, and at present, it can only be adapted to local conditions and individual methods, and some key points are suggested: (1) Those who have transportation passing through or directly reaching should request to carry mail. (2) When no transportation is available, organize postmen to deliver mail, detouring when necessary. This method is purely experimental, and if the results are good, the General Post Office will find a way to standardize the regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Shi Meiyu Issues Statement on the Declaration of Innocence for Okamura; Japanese War Criminals Escorted to Sugamo Prison in Tokyo is an Emergency Evacuation, Not a Release <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the declaration of innocence for Okamura Neiji, the Communist side broadcast a great deal of criticism. In addition, Okamura, along with more than 200 other Japanese war criminals who had been sentenced, was escorted from Shanghai to Sugamo Prison in Tokyo on the 28th of last month, causing even more discussion from the outside world. Shi Meiyu, the presiding judge of the military tribunal, specially met with reporters yesterday to issue a statement, saying: This court is ordered to try Japanese war criminals, purely based on legal grounds, so those with conclusive evidence of guilt, such as Tani Hisao and Sakai Takashi, have been clearly executed and not tolerated in the slightest. Those who only participated in combat and did not violate international law or the atrocities listed in our country's war criminal trial regulations should be declared innocent according to the law, and they cannot be treated differently because of their status or relationship to show revenge. In this case of Okamura Neiji, although the defendant was the commander-in-chief of the enemy army, he was appointed at a time when Japan was about to surrender. All the major atrocities in the Nanjing Massacre and other war zones occurred before the defendant's tenure and were originally unrelated to the defendant. As for during his tenure, after detailed investigation by this court, no atrocities for which he should be responsible were found. Therefore, after a joint trial, it was deemed that he should be declared innocent according to the law. However, this judgment must be submitted for approval before it can be finalized. This point was clearly declared at the time of the judgment. As for this time, the defendant, along with Takahashi Toyoichi, Katayama Sadao, Yoshida Kensho, Nakayama Ryoichi, Matsuyama Toyoaki, Miyakawa Jōzō, Sakuraba Shirō and seven other defendants who were declared innocent in other cases, and 253 convicted criminals such as Isogai Rensuke, were temporarily escorted to Sugamo Prison in Japan due to the proximity of the Jinghu-Kunming war zone and as an emergency measure to evacuate the prison. War criminals are common war criminals of the Allied nations, and Tokyo is a safe area under the jurisdiction of the Allied nations, so evacuating and transferring them is not the same as releasing them. Moreover, the above-mentioned cases of innocence have not yet been approved by the Supreme Commander. If a retrial is issued, the criminals should still be escorted back to China for retrial, which our delegation in Japan can definitely accomplish.</p>

Upon receiving the report, the Fishmongers' United Association sent a letter to the fish market yesterday to protest, demanding punishment of the perpetrators, compensation, and an apology, and a firm guarantee that the same incident will not happen again, in order to appease public anger.</p>

<p>In order to promote the health of citizens, the Municipal Health Bureau previously launched pre-marital health check-ups, designating hospitals in various districts of the city for men and women to go for check-ups before marriage. It has been several months since the promotion, but the results have been minimal, and the general public does not seem to be interested in this. According to reporters, the Health Bureau has not issued a second pre-marital health certificate since issuing the first one, because very few people pass the inspection, and few citizens apply for registration and inspection before marriage.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] At 5:25 PM yesterday, the ticket booth of the French Tramway and Public Bus Company station in Xieqiao, Nanshi, was suddenly smashed by more than 50 people in uniform. The 43rd ticket seller, 17th ticket inspector, and 399th, 409th, and 648th ticket sellers, who were working in the booth, were dragged out and beaten severely, causing them to be seriously injured and fall to the ground. The perpetrators then dispersed in a crowd. When the vehicle employees saw this, they immediately reported to the union and the responsible police branch, and sent the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, all the French trams on Route 18, the French buses on Routes 23 and 20, and the buses of the Traffic Company of the Municipal Public Utility Bureau on Route 20, which were running on the machine, were successively suspended. The French employees demanded that the perpetrators be punished, that the medical expenses of the injured be compensated, and that the safety of their work be guaranteed in the future. After negotiations with relevant parties by Xu Bingshan, a representative of the industry union, an agreement was reached at about 7 o'clock on the payment of medical expenses, so the trolleybuses on Route 18 and the buses on Route 23 resumed operation at 8 o'clock. However, the buses on Route 20 only drove back to the factory because no definite statement was received on the punishment of the perpetrators and the guarantee of safety, and are waiting for a solution today.</p>
<p>[Further News] According to nearby eyewitnesses, the incident was caused by a misunderstanding between a uniformed person and a ticket seller at the Route 20 bus station of the Traffic Company at around 2 PM yesterday over a bus ride. The uniformed person then quickly left. At 5:25 PM, they gathered their companions and returned. Mistaking the French Company's ticket booth for the same system, they smashed it without asking questions and beat up five staff members in the booth.</p>

According to observations from all sides, the sinking of the two Wheels this time was a complete capsize, and all passengers and crew members were concentrated on the top floor at the time, rather than being confined in the cabin, so the bodies may have drifted away in all directions, making the salvage work very difficult. Moreover, the exact location of the sinking of the two ships has not been accurately determined by any party so far, and the survey work cannot be started. If there were still those who escaped danger at the time and had reached the nearby deserted islands, the consequences of starvation and cold over the past week would be hard to imagine. It is also said that Chen Zhengyu, a former special correspondent for this newspaper in Fuzhou, was among the passengers who died in the Taiping Wheel disaster. Mr. Chen was on the Wheel to spend the New Year in Taiwan. Unexpectedly, he was selected for the tragic disaster. Now his younger brother, Chen Shoulian, has rushed to Shanghai to handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>According to the China Xinglun Steamship Company, the passenger said in the report that a giant wheel sailed past after the accident, but did not come to rescue, and that the wheel seemed to be the China Xinglun, which is not true. At that time, the position of the China Xinglun was far away from the scene of the Taiping accident by more than 110 nautical miles.</p>

<p>Gong Jiao Defeats Lan You, He Zhong Defeats Tian Zhang</p>
<p>The preliminary round of the Chen You Cup Basketball Yi Group Finals was held yesterday evening at the Ba Xian Qiao YMCA, consisting of two matches. In the first match, Lan You faced Gong Jiao, with Wu Zibin and Liu Hesheng officiating. From the start, Lan You's defense was weak and full of openings, which Gong Jiao exploited with aggressive attacks, consistently taking the lead. At halftime, Gong Jiao led with a score of 28 to 14. After switching sides, Lan You improved their organization and the game became closer, but their initial deficit was too large and time was limited. By the end of the match, Lan You was eliminated with a score of 59 to 42.</p>
<p>The subsequent match was between Tian Zhang and He Zhong, refereed by Liu Hesheng and Di Xianzhang. He Zhong demonstrated superior skill and immediately took the lead.

After the break, He Zhong's players continued to be active, and their score climbed steadily. Tian Zhang fought hard, but their gains were insufficient. In the end, He Zhong won with a score of 41 to 26, advancing to the next round.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Winter Vacation Nears End: Student Aid Must Be Timely; Hope for Generous Donations to Reach Target <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Lunar New Year came and went in a flash. We recall that in the days leading up to New Year's Eve, we earnestly appealed to readers to economize during the holiday and donate the savings to student aid, helping impoverished youth avoid dropping out of school.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, we have not received a substantial donation. With the winter vacation drawing to a close, countless poor students are eagerly awaiting our assistance. Kind-hearted readers, if you sympathize with these students, now is an opportune time to donate funds for rice purchases. Here is a brief report:</p>
<p>On January 27th, with donations totaling $28.80 (including the previous balance), we purchased 18 shi of Zhongbai rice at a market price of $1600 per shi.</p>
<p>On January 28th, with donations totaling $9.60, we purchased 4 shi at a market price of $2400 per shi.</p>
<p>On February 2nd, we purchased 2.5 shi at a market price of $4500, totaling $11.25. (Detailed accounts will be available in tomorrow's social services section.)</p>
<p>In recent days, prices have been rising at an alarming rate. If we do not take measures to purchase and store rice, our entire plan will be in jeopardy when school starts. Therefore, we promptly purchase and store rice as soon as we receive donations. Finally, we hope that readers will continue to donate, so that the student aid fund can reach its intended target soon.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Brandy at $10,000 a Bottle: Post-Spring Festival Prices Alarming; After Welcoming the God of Wealth, Most Stores Still Half-Closed <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the Spring Festival, prices are like a spring dream; when you wake up, everything has changed. Among them, black market gold and silver have risen the most fiercely. The silver coins that could be heard clinking everywhere in the alleys have jumped three times in the five days of the Spring Festival. Most other things to eat and wear have risen by one to two times. According to custom, stores should have opened for business yesterday after eating the God of Wealth the night before, but strolling through the streets, only half of the stores were open. Those that were open had their doors half-closed, with only a few goods sparsely displayed in the windows, as if they were reluctant to sell them.</p>
<p>The four major public utilities opened for business yesterday, but they were sparsely attended. Everyone admired the new high prices of various goods with a curious expression. A pair of short children's cotton socks was priced at $140. The most basic men's shirts cost at least $900 each. Small towels cost about $200 each. Most of the biscuits in the confectionery section were already gone, with only the salted soda crackers left, priced at $240 per pound. Sausages were affected by the soaring meat prices, costing $640 per catty. Good mushrooms cost $2,000 per catty. Other luxury goods such as tobacco and alcohol were even more shockingly priced. A bottle of high-end brandy was priced at $10,000. A flat box of 25 Cuban or Manila cigars was priced at $8,800. A gentleman's Haden felt hat was priced at $13,000. Furthermore, the otter fur coats worn by ladies and wives cost $320,000 each at Hongxiang Company. To order one, you had to pay the full price in advance. The clerks in the company said, "There's no way around it, the prices fluctuate every day."</p>
<p>The prices of rice and vegetables, which are of most concern to citizens, were simply in a state of unprecedented anarchic chaos during the Spring Festival. Yesterday, premium rice opened at around $4,300 to $4,400. However, during the Spring Festival, rice shops were asking for as much as $6,000 to $7,000. Many rice shops were still not open yesterday, and even those that followed the opening price had already risen by two times compared to New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>Pork and Mutton Soar; Cabbage is Highly Valued</p>
<p>Although the prices of vegetables varied in different vegetable markets, the trend was consistently upward. Pork and beef rose the most. For example, pork was priced as high as $400 per catty the day before yesterday, with retail lean meat priced from $300 to $360 per catty. Yesterday, prices recovered slightly, from $280 to $320 per catty. Beef remained at the $300 mark per catty. Chicken was priced from $240 to $300 per catty, depending on the leanness. Egg prices also doubled, from $80 per catty on New Year's Eve to $220 per catty yesterday. Wholesale egg shops sold large eggs for $22 to $25 each, but street vendors were selling them for $40 each. Other items included fresh shrimp at $360 per catty, grass carp at $10 per catty, and green fish at $15 per catty.</p>
<p>Among the vegetables, cabbage was highly valued at $40 per catty. However, during the Spring Festival, Tacco cabbage was priced at $35 per catty. Yesterday, the market stabilized, and small pond vegetables, Tacco cabbage, spinach, and Xue Li Hong were priced from $15 to $20 per catty. Yellow bean sprouts cost $25. Tofu cost $20 per square, potatoes cost $30 per catty, and tomatoes cost $80 per catty.</p>
<p>A Long Snake Line is Seen Again in Front of the Zhong Fang Company</p>
<p>Other daily necessities such as fuel, cotton cloth, cigarettes, soap, galoshes, and sneakers all increased in price. Coal briquettes were adjusted to $900 per load yesterday, a twofold increase. The Texas Oil Company's kerosene was priced at $3,000 per can (5 gallons), a more than twofold increase. Fine Longtou cloth was priced at $5,000 per bolt, and a long snake line appeared again at the second sales department of Zhong Fang. Soap cost $60 to $70 per bar. Yuanbao-style galoshes cost $400 to $500 per pair. Long galoshes cost $2,000 per pair, and basketball shoes cost $800 to $900 per pair. Even the spiritual food of the masses—newspapers—still maintained their old price of about $5 per copy, but street vendors were charging $10 per copy.</p>
<p>With such prices, merchants still spoke eloquently, believing that the prices of goods were not rising in proportion to the prices of gold and silver, and always feeling that the goods in their hands were particularly cheap. However, in the eyes of the average citizen, these unprecedentedly high-priced goods could only be appreciated as decorations!</p>

<h3 id="e79">Shanghai's Spring Market Soars 150%; Authorities to Dump Materials Today; Gold Control Bureau to Crack Down on Gold and Cash Black Market <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the market opened yesterday after the New Year holiday, prices were stable in the morning because merchants were concerned that the authorities would dump a large number of materials. At noon, however, dumping was seen in practice, causing prices to rise sharply. By the time the market closed in the evening, prices had risen by more than 150% compared to when the market closed last year. According to the observation of people concerned, the main reason for the surge in prices this New Year was the tense situation, so the price increase was across the board. The rise in prices was seen in various places, including Hankou, Chongqing and Guangzhou, and was not limited to Shanghai alone, especially in Tianjin, where prices were more than twice as high as in this city. It is estimated that there is currently over 10 billion in floating capital concentrated in Shanghai. The creator of this amount of floating capital is the unlimited inflationary policy. The issuance of new banknotes is concentrated in Shanghai, and the area where gold yuan notes are circulating is decreasing daily. Major cities such as Beiping and Tianjin have been "liberated", and silver dollar transactions are popular in various provinces and cities in Central China. Gold yuan notes have been expelled, so each new issue is only active in Shanghai. In terms of dumping materials, the authorities only dumped a small amount of sugar yesterday, which was a small amount. The authorities in charge of food said that it would be dumped when necessary. The sale of gauze was discussed at a meeting of the Textile Construction Corporation yesterday, and a decision was made. The company will only take action when the price increase is fierce. The application procedures for various items from the Material Supply Bureau take time. In summary, the authorities have adopted a realistic policy regarding the dumping of materials, that is, to recognize the market price and dump them at high prices, rather than dumping them at prices far below the market price, so as to consume materials and still be unable to stabilize prices in the end. It is heard that the authorities have decided to dump a large number of materials starting today to combat speculation; at the same time, the Gold Control Bureau will take coordinated action to crack down on black market gold and cash transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Rice Prices Soar <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Northern Market Special Rice $4,600; Flour, Grain and Oil Cakes Increase by More Than 100%</p>
<p>The rice market opened high yesterday, due to the sharp rise in prices of various goods in the industry during the New Year holiday, and the already high prices outside the market, resulting in a sharp increase of more than 150% compared to last year. White rice in the Northern Market cost $4,400, a sharp increase of $2,800 compared to the closing price last year. Thin rice was $4,300, early rice was $3,900, and special high rice was $4,600, all with sharp increases of $2,600 to $2,700. The Southern Market opened higher, and the market later softened. White rice closed at $4,200, and early rice initially cost $4,000, closing at $3,900, each with an increase of $2,500 to $2,600. There were very few goods arriving yesterday, with a total of 3,221 stones in the two markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Prices jumped 100% due to strong fluctuations in various goods during the New Year holiday, and people were generally optimistic. The initial market opened with a large distribution at $1,350, and then the military ship was traded at $1,400. The old car initially opened at $1,450, and the cargo owner in the middle of the market raised the price, once shouting to do $1,500. After persuasion by a person in charge of the market, people's hearts calmed down, and the market was not seen to open. The prices of Hongfeng and Jiancheng all increased by 100%. Bran was firm first and then returned, and Fuxin's large package was traded at $1,100 near closing.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>The market opened with a fierce surge in prices. Due to the unstable situation and the sharp reduction in goods from the producing areas, the market could not meet the demand. Soybeans rose the most sharply, with oil factories absorbing a lot. Hankou's Zhadou quickly rose by $1,000, and was traded at $1,900. Later, the holders held on, and the asking price broke through the $2,000 mark, but there was no formal transaction. Che Dou was made for $2,400 yesterday, and the asking price was $2,500 at the close. Raw peanuts also rose more than 100%, and sesame, corn, and red grain all rose by about 100%.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>The market opened for trading yesterday, and prices rose sharply. Because other items had risen sharply during the New Year holiday, prices also rose sharply. Although exports were temporarily suspended, prices rose sharply due to the small amount of inventory and the scarcity of goods. Soybean oil closed at $18,000, raw oil reached $20,000, and raw vegetable oil closed at $1,600, each with a sharp increase of 200% compared to the closing price last year. Soybean cake closed at $1,400, but still could not be bought.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Monetary Policy Eases; Cash Funds Abundant <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the New Year market, and the markets in various industries in the city have resumed operations. After a short break for several days, business is booming. The floating capital accumulated by various parties around the end of the year has flowed into the market in large quantities, resulting in an unusually loose monetary policy. The highest secret interest rate in the market was $40, but mostly between $30 and $35. The government has plans to dump materials and withdraw monetary policy, so people are quite wary. However, it is generally believed that there is too much capital in the city, and it is extremely difficult to withdraw it for a while.</p>
<p>Cash funds were very abundant yesterday, and the banknotes that had been dispersed among the people before the year were returning in large quantities. The counters of the banking houses were unusually busy, which was rare in recent times. There are no longer any restrictions on withdrawals, and the phenomenon of discounts has completely disappeared.</p>

<p>The tung oil market yesterday: The association's listed price was not opened until the afternoon, and the asking prices of the same industry were soaring because the sharp increase in prices of the eight major public utilities affected the cost greatly, so they all followed the soaring prices. Full-sized white oil and genuine Xihong reached $12,000, and the rest, such as deputy Xihong and Qing oil, all increased by about 200% compared to Lunar New Year's Eve. Transactions lacked actual value, and generally had to be returned to normal today to open the market.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Tea Market Process Calm <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the tea market was still as quiet as water, because there was a shortage of tea in stock, and the prices of goods outside the market had skyrocketed, so those who held the goods were unwilling to give up, and they were reluctant to give up on various varieties. However, no transactions were seen, and the process ended quietly. According to the current situation, the tea market will definitely become more and more prosperous.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Silk Rises More Than 100% <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Man-made silk opened high yesterday, and the market rose sharply. After the market opened, the money in the market became more relaxed, and buying was extremely strong. No. 120 Tianqiao opened at $155,000 and shouted, but later, due to the soaring black market price of gold, people were restless, and the table was re-raised, and the rise was very strong. The asking price soared to $185,000, and the trend was still strong at the close, and the appetite was not weak. As a result, it was $5,000 better. More than 100% higher than the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Because the exchange transfer certificate rose, the shouting prices of various items outside the market were chaotic and the rise was unclear during the closure of the market, so people were also stimulated. After the premium retail market opened high yesterday, the market rose all the way, and the asking price approached the peak of $210,000. Afterwards, the rise was too violent, and the appetite turned sluggish. At noon, it recovered slightly by $20,000, but it also rose sharply by more than 100%.</p>
<p>The cloth market opened high and closed low yesterday. Initially, the money was very loose and people were firm. The Meiya quilt surface was opened at $138,000, a high price, and the transactions were frequent. The selling trend was still strong, and the table was mostly watching. The price fell back and hovered around $115,000. Near noon, various items outside the industry rose together, and the market stood firm. Until the close, there was no significant rise or fall.</p>
<p>Man-made Silk Listed Price Decided</p>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau held a man-made silk meeting yesterday and decided that the price of man-made silk from January 31 to February 5 would be 152,000 yuan per box of Italian goods No. 120 Grade 3 with light.</p>

Hongxiang flannelette opened at $3,600 per yard, Zhanghua flannelette $3,500, No. 55 and Shuangmao brand medium-thick Serge opened at $2,800, and Yinfeng Huada tweed $3,000. Compared with the closing prices of old stocks, the average increase was more than 50%. Although there were many red flags, the reality was not so. Because only the prices were mutually consulted, there were no importers. It was found that the high opening of this market was not related to the cost of woolen production and sales, but was completely driven by the general price of goods.</p>
<p>Wood is Stable</p>
<p>The wood market is about 150% higher than last spring. The actual sales have not moved, and business must be after the Lantern Festival. However, there has been a large purchase of fir in recent days, so the market is still stable.</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn Prices opened. The closing prices of both coarse and fine yarns fell. Although there was talk of a sale by the authorities, no sales were seen on the market yesterday, so people raised prices and the market turned sharply for the better.</p>
<p>The blue Phoenix 42 was initially called $165,000, and the purchasers were very indifferent due to concerns about sales by the authorities, and the market was soft. Later, the American Aid Association did not list prices for sale yesterday, and the buying trend in the market suddenly arose, and the price was shouted up to $210,000 in an instant.</p>
<p>The price of Shuangwei 21 was initially called $120,000, and velvet was traded at $115,000. In the middle of the transaction, the staff member came to the market and was about to start listing prices, and the people's hearts softened, and the buying was very light. The price was called $110,000, but no one asked. Afterwards, the yarn dumping work was delayed and not started, so the market changed sharply and the price rose. Today, the price was $142,000 at the close.</p>
<p>The cloth market yesterday rose sharply. Prices of all commodities rose sharply, and the market continued the asking price of the previous tea party. The market opened at a high price.

<p>Cigarettes: The trading of "Red Plate" cigarettes was brisk, with prices soaring uniformly. Each grade has risen approximately twofold compared to before the Lunar New Year.
