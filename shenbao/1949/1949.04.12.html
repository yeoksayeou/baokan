<h3>政府將發時局聲明　和談全體代表晤毛澤東　周詳商討接近核心問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕據確實消息，政府將於短期內發表有時局之聲明一件，該項聲明正由政院方面起草中，卽可定稿。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕代總統十一日績接北平方面電話，再度說明中共已於十日下令，卽日起停止軍事進攻，同時報告代表團在平興中共代表之接觸稱：首度代表張治中曾於八日晨九時至午後一時與中共領袖毛澤東作四小時之長談。章士劍及邵力子則於九日晤見毛氏，亦長談數小時，十日全體代表均與毛氏會見，目前和談正式會議雖仍未開始，但各項問題之交換意見，已極為接近，八項條件不再堅持。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕據確悉：和談代表團首席代表張治中，曾於八日與中共領袖毛澤東作四小四之長談，章士劍及邵力子二位代表，九日晤見毛氏，對種種問題，均有極為周詳之時論，旦漸接近諸核心問題。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕和談進行期中第三方面在平·京兩地均有甚大之努力，除已派代表來京表達意見外，同時在平亦作居間之地位。關於中共下令停止軍事進攻一節，卽為第三方面努力之結果，十日晚十時自平來電話通知李代總統者，亦為第三方之人士。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕中共下令停止軍事進攻後，據十一日所獲消息，前方各綫雖仍有部份接觸，似已漸有休止趨勢，惟此次僅係中共停止進攻，國軍久未採取攻勢，故政府方面毋庸考慮頒發同樣命令，十一日傳國防部亦已頒布停戰命令說，經詢參謀總長顧祝同，已證明不確。</p>
<h3>政府大員赴平　中共表示觀迎　于石任大致同意北上</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕中共方面對政府大員赴平事，表示歡迎，聞會在第三方面人士致代總統之電話中，說明中共「歡迎幾們老先生來北平看看」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕于右任，張羣，吳忠信等四大員，將應李代總統之邀請，於三五日內赴平，協助和談工作之進行。李代總統為盯事特親自奔走，十一日晚六時曾至于右任官邸，說明渠於於十日晚接獲北平第三方面人士長途電話，促于氏等從速赴平，代總統曾在電話中表示，長江綫戰事逼近，右老無法前來，該人士卽答稱：中共已同意下令停止軍事進狼，代總統亦允可卽邀請于氏就道，代總統於說明此事前，並特告以中共已下令停止軍事進攻一點。于氏十一日竟日有立監委往訪，多數均係敦促于氏應遂赴平，于氏晚八時接見記者時稱：除一小點之保留外，余已同意。</p>
<h3>李代總統何院長　辭職之說係謠傳</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京十一日電〕政府發言人，頃鄭重否認廣州昨日所傳李代總統及何院長有辭職意之謠傳。</p>
<h3>吳鐵城抵京　聯絡黨內意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕前政院副院長吳鐵城，十一日晨八時三刻乘中航機自滬抵京，外次董霖，立委陳博生同來，行政院長何應欽，秘書長黃少谷，交長端木傑等均至機場相迎旋吳氏卽隨何院長至門雞閘何氏官邸，晤談約半小時後始至外交賓館休息，中午往謁代總統，晚七時赴何氏之宴，聞吳氏此行為協助李代總統及何院長推進有關和談事宜，以及代表在穗國發黨內同志，對時局之意見來京作換聯絡者。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕行政院長何應欽，十一日晚七時在官邸宴請吳鐵城，並邀全體部會首長作部，席間交換意見，暢談甚歡。</p>
<h3>閻錫山再赴溪口</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕閻錫山十一日下午四時半乘追雲號專機再止溪口晉謁蔣總裁，有所請示，方聞隨行，聞閻氏此行將在溪口停留一夜，十二日卽行返京。</p>
<h3>白崇禧游興濃　昨泛舟玄武湖</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕白崇禧連日遊興甚濃，十日曾遊陵園，十一日下午則泛舟玄武湖，同遊者有來自北平之黃啟漢，劉仲容等，白氏在湖中遇熟識之記者，曾打招呼谓：「今天天氣好，正好玩玩」，狀甚閒適。</p>
<h3>劉子衡返京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕自平抵京三神秘客之一劉子衡，在滬僅留一日，十一日晨自滬返京，渠竟日未返寓，曾往訪其餘二神秘客朱蘊山·李民欣長談。據彼等此行任務可望圓滿達成，至返平日期在三五日內，可能與政府赴平大員同機北飛。</p>
<h3>重慶號出走咎有攸歸　柱永清撤職留任　總統頒令懲儆並觀後效</h3>
<p>〔中央北社南京十一日電〕總統四月十一日令：查本年二月廿五日重慶號軍艦潛逃一案，海軍總司令桂永清事前疏於防範，並對該艦人事處理亦欠妥善，實屬咎有攸歸，惟念該總司令久膺軍職，夙著勛勞，該艦出亡之日，適在巡行期間，防止不及，應予從寬議處，着卽撤職留任，以示懲儆，而觀後效，此令。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕監委曹德宣·盧鳳閣調查重慶號出走案，已對桂永清提出糾舉，並經審查成立。糾舉理由認為重慶號之出走，桂實應負其責，糾舉書中指出，桂利用海軍復利用派系傾軋，作為控制之術，青島系老幹部既被排擠，近復利用青島系少壯派，以排斥馬尾系，派系磨擦，形成重慶號出走之遠因，至免鄧兆祥職，代以年經資淺之慮東閣，鄧要求做一法制委員而不可得，僅發表其第一署副署長，反令其于交待績留艦上服務兩月，實為促使重慶號出走之近因</p>
<h3>方東沈熙瑞　堅辭新職</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕新發表之財部常次方東，央行副總裁沈熙瑞，對於新職均堅辭不就，劉部長兼總裁以該兩職不便久懸，已在考慮繼任人選中。又財部國庫署長謝耿民辭職照准，還職飛毛腿部已發表由京央行經理陳慶瑜繼任，京央行經理則由央行發表王鍾繼任。</p>
<h3>政院新聞處長　派鮑靜安兼任</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕行政院十一日發出命令，派該院參呈鮑靜安兼任行政院新聞處處長。</p>
<h3>鎮江當面情勢轉緩和　江北共軍略後撤移　小股共軍偷渡揚中西南</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江十一日電〕鎮江當面情況轉趨緩和，江北岸各橋頭堡陣地過去廿四小時內未聞砲聲共軍第一綫部隊全部約北撤五華里至八華里，此舉顯然係停戰令下達後之影響。進攻六圩之共軍今已由老四圩，朱家旗桿，退至唐家橋，馬家灣，施家橋一綫整補，瓜洲以北共軍由後花園，八里舖退至花園荘；三面進攻十二圩之共軍第八兵團廿六軍大部份已退至新城以北劉荘，陳荘一帶，新城現已成為真空地帶，共軍向後撤退，國軍並未追擊。又駐六圩國軍丁作彬部，今奉令調回江南整補，另由某軍接替六圩防務，龍窩口方面仍在國軍堅守中</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江十一日電〕駐鎮海軍第二艦隊司令林遵，十一日電海總司令部，請加撥軍艦砲艇來鎮，協助國軍固守江北岸橋頭堡</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江十一日電〕三江營共軍一部，七日夜配合土共進攻鎮江縣屬第一區大橋鎮（鎮揚交界），經地方團隊沉着應戰，至十日夜，共軍復大最增援四個團猛攻，因衆寡懸殊，地方團隊已主動撤移至大港。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕據軍聞社訊：（一）空軍偵察報告，共軍木船數十隻，載共軍一小股，十一日午後由三江營偷渡長江，竄據揚中西南西北之二十四圩及七十九圩附近，國軍已馳剿。（二）划子口十日午後戰事緩和十一日國軍向東反擊，斃傷共軍百餘，該地情勢穩定。（三）進攻鎮江對岸瓜州六圩二二圩之共軍，十日下午稍向北撤，仍留一部與國軍對戰。</p>
<h3>馬鴻逵夫婦抵京　對北平式和科謂不明白　談話時以人民生活為念</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕寗夏主席馬鴻逵應李代總統電召，偕夫人劉慕俠女士於十一日下午一時半自寗夏乘專機飛抵京，李代總統派代表劉士毅往迎，馬氏下機後卽赴寗海路二號休息，並接見往訪之寗夏籍立。監委，晚六時白長官崇禧往訪，長談一小時許，並卽進晚餐，迄八時始行辭出。據馬氏語本報記者，和平為全國人民所殷望，化干戈為玉帛，救人民於水火，乃今日所必需，如和平能夠成功，實為任何人所翹盼。記者詢其對於傅作義北平式和平之看法，馬氏以不明白北平情形為詞，避免作答，但以反問似的口吻說：「我和傅先生是很好的朋友，我們都是軍人，對於軍事是本行，但對於政治總不免有點搞不好，這次傅先生恐怕是因為預先的籌劃有點欠高明吧？」當記者提及傅作義四月一日的通電時，馬氏上以懷疑的語調反問說：「是真的嗎？」後來馬氏又說，我們有很好的民生主義，惜乎沒能實行，如果能夠實行，就不會要共產黨來解放了，天氣暖了，我們會脫去皮褲，為甚麼我們不自已來解放呢？」馬氏談話時，頗以人民生活為念，他說現在再不是封建軍閥的時代了，一切都應該為老百姓的生活着想。他這次來京，打算多留幾天，除了晉謁李代總統外，還打算醫治一下疾病。</p>
<p>又馬氏定十二日晨九時晉謁李代總統，十一時晉謁何院長。李代總統十二日晚七時宴請馬氏。</p>
<h3>儀徵縣長左治人　被俘後押解赴聲</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江十一日電〕據悉：在儀徵戰役中，縣長左治人被俘後，共軍已於十日押解揚州軍管會。</p>
<h3>鎮江北門機場　限期修築完成</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江十二日電〕蘇省建設廳，頃令鎮縣府限四月十五日前將鎮江東北門飛機場修築完成。</p>
<h3>武漢守備司令談　外圍有周祥佈置</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口十日電〕（遲到）武漢守備司令魯道源今接見本報記者談，武漢外圍防綫雖已日見緊縮，但我方已有周詳佈置，此間城防工事亦甚堅固，共軍如欲在湖沼地帶舉兵進犯漢口，實非容易之事，且在戰略上東西兩側各橋頭堡之重要性，無寗更大於漢口，目前共軍壓力雖增，而和談尚未絕望短期內武漢安全當可無虞，市民不必自相驚擾，至有力自動疏散者僅可聽其自由，此時亦無須加以限制或干涉云。</p>
<h3>鄂東戰事迫近江邊　孝感黃陂間國軍完成部署　蕪湖對江共軍攻勢已頓挫</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口十一日電〕軍息：共軍於陳兵平漢南段後，一面在鐵路西側安陸以南雲夢長江埠之綫控制若干據點，以捬孝感之背；一面復在鐵路東側分越過河口鎮及宋埠兩要陰，以進窺黃陂，威脅武漢右翼。正面國軍為適應此形勢，已在綫形勢十日無大變化，共軍行動似尚有所等待。惟鄂東方面共軍連陷浠水。黃梅後，戰事已逼近江北橋頭堡，海軍為加強江防，已調派盤艇數艘增防武穴·田家鎮。蔪水以迄關溪鎮江面，同時鄂中鄂西土共亦有向南推動模樣，今後數日發展極堪注意。</p>
<p>〔本報黃陂十日電〕（遲到）保衛武漢三鎮之某二有力兵團，已利用漢口外國複雜地形，憑藉強固工事，完成新部署。現平漢鐵路東側之黃陂，平漢正面三汷埠以迄孝感暨應城漢川交界地區之府河西岸，已完成漢口北東西三面最前綫。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕軍聞社訊：蕪湖對江西梁山·裕溪口·二壩一帶，十一日晨共軍攻勢稍挫。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十一日電〕軍息：（一）安慶外圍之共軍六百餘十日晚向農林學校及青峯嶺偷襲，因我軍戒嚴極嚴，迄未得手。（二）黃梅共軍十日黃昏向濯港襲擊，當經守軍予以還擊後退去。（三）浠水共軍千餘，十日向六神港進擊，守軍以衆寡懸殊激戰一小時後退出。（四）林彪之四十軍，十日竄據安陸，四三軍一部二千十日竄黃坡北橫山。</p>

<p>自被捕至開釋　金紹先述經過</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕立委金紹先十一日下午對本報記者詳述渠十日被捕及開釋之經過如次：十日下午十二時許，金訪友歸來，在漢口路附近遇許聞天，當卽同乘三輪車返中央飯店，過大行宮後，許稱：擬赴文見書局訪立委諶小岑，金以距中央飯店不遠，乃同時下車，並隨許入文風書店翻閱陳列之書籍等候，當見許於上樓時有人問：「找誰」？許稱：找諶委員，但許似覺謁問者神情有異，略事猶疑，卽擬退回，該詢問者突改變面目，不准許離去，許出示立委出席證，謂係立法委員，彼等稱：係奉命辦理，遂有二三人將許帶走，同時有人向金查問，金以為與彼無關，但查詢者則請金登樓時約為下午三時，金登樓後，見有軍官及士兵數人在內，渠以尚有約會，擬打電話，亦未蒙允許，金在爛醉如泥上約留一刻鐘，卽由便衣二人押赴衛戌總部警衛組，在該處被押者已有男女十餘，許聞天亦在內，並帶有手銬，彼此相對無言，旋有陳高參來談，據云係奉令辦理，重要者為許聞天，至金紹先應如何發落，須請示上海，金曾為許關說，謂此一介書生，何必上手銬，可否請除去，陳未允。金又請打電話給張耀明，陳答張管不着，此事係奉上海方面之命令辦理者。金稱：依憲法規定不能隨意逮捕立委，最好能令長官知道，陳稱：知道，但對電張事仍不予考慮。旋陳向上海打電話請示，因對方負責人不在而未果，陳當將許聞天及另二人帶走，臨行時將金交衛總警衛組長看守，此時情形似已緩和，戒備較鬆，金遂乘機與同被拘捕者交談，知文風書局之布置已有二三日，被捕者中有文見書局經理·職員及工友等，均曾受嚴訊，是時則陸績交保釋放，尚有二人正在對保。看守者謂，你們放心，今天一定可以釋出，，候至晚十一時許，似已獲得上海電話，准將金釋放，看守者謂，另人須交保，金係立法委員，不必取保，但請金外出後應保守秘密，勿將經過情形對外道及，金不允，寗願繼績被押，彼等考慮甚久，至十一時半始將金釋出。</p>
<p>李代總統　派員慰問</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕十日被捕當日開釋之立委金紹先，十一晨曾分訪謁立法院長童冠賢，行政院長何應欽，說明被捕經過，並以電話請謁李代總統，李代總統當於下午四時半派立委邱昌渭赴金氏寓邸詢問經過，表示慰問。童院長則表示，希望何院長能列席院會，就此事加以說明，金氏晤及何應欽時，何表示事先對此事毫無所悉，曾詢衛戌總司令張耀明，張亦稱不知，金當對何提出三點，希望：（一）許聞天身體素弱，盼能迅速開釋，（二）立委安全受威脅，盼採取有效措施，以為保障，（三）個人安全是否將有問題，盼予以保護。何答稱：許聞天氏渠已令迅速護送回京，立委安全問題，當似量設法保障，至金氏個人安全，渠相信不致有何問題，但渠仍允研究具體辦法。</p>
<p>許金被捕事件　立院今提討論</p>
<p>並請何院長列席報告</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕立委十一日晨獲知許聞天·金紹先兩氏於十日被捕之消息後，情緒感極激昂，認此為「違憲」之舉，因憲法第三十四條規定「立法委員除現行犯外，非經立法院許可，不得逮捕或拘禁」，許·金係於訪友時被捕，當非「現行犯」，而逮捕之前，立院並未接獲任何通知，十一日晨九時許卽有立委數十人赴立院訪謁院長童冠賢，請卽設法營救，並糾正經種違憲情事，當經決定於十二日院會中提出討論，請何政院長應欽卽日列席院會，對此次逮捕事件提出報告，同時推童冠賢卽最往訪何應欽交涉釋放許聞天。</p>

<h3>社論　發展本市的工商業！</h3>
<p>上海市政府於十日晨舉行工商座談會，分析當前的經濟現狀，想在困雞的環境之中，探索出　條發展本市工商業的坦途，參加座談的，都是本市工商界的領袖，紛紛發言，對於當前經濟現象的是非得失，均有良好的意見提出；他們看到當前經濟危機四伏的情形，例如：（一）最近物價的日漲夜大，於一日之間要漲價好幾次；（二）利息高到嚇死人，扼殺了正當的工商業：（三）原料來源缺乏，製成品售出後，幾乎無法再生產；（四）糧食，燃料以及其他日常必需品的存底日見稀薄，使市民的生活都將感受威脅；（五）製成品　銷路停滯，在物價高漲之下，反而發生蕭條現象。因此他們一致認為，如要發展本市的工商業，則非立卽實行南北物資交換不可，於是決定由工商有關機關十餘單位，組織一個南北物資交流設計委員會，以謀南北物資交換得以早日實現。</p>
<p>自去年十一月間開放限價以來，物價一路上漲，幾無止境；但工商界的蕭條現象，却一直存在着。這種畸形的現象，如果以經濟學的理論來解釋，幾乎是無法說明的。論理，經濟繁榮是物價高漲時期的必然現象，唯有在生產過剩物價下跌，才會發生經濟蕭條　現象。在老法幣的時代，通貨膨脹得愈快，物價漲得也愈高，一般工商業在「水漲船高一的原理之下，也隨着呈出繁榮的景氣，雖屬表面的繁榮，但無論如何，總能勉强維持下去。可是現在，一方面是物價高漲，使消費者人人都感到生活的威脅；另一方面則是經濟蕭條，使一般工商都感到求死不得求生不能的痛苦。</p>
<p>造成這種畸形現象的因索，固然不一而足；但其中最主要的原因，第一是生產成本太大，原料大半來自國外，因為外匯證的價格猛漲不已，已超過物價上漲的倍數；製成品出售後，便補不進原料，就無法冉生產。即以國內的原料而論，又因為戰爭的持續及交通的困難，原料上漲的速度，也往往在製成品之上。第二是高利貸的壓迫，使工商界不勝利息的負担，廉價傾銷所得，又不能再生產，因此只有出於緊縮與停工的一途了。</p>
<p>這種現象的繼續存在，不僅使工商界人士走頭無路，而且影響所及，使一般靠「生活指數」度日的薪工階級，也將無以為生。「生活指數」與物價脫節，巳是誰都不能否認的事實，薪工階級的埋怨生活指數的不準確，也巳是到處可聞的定論。但是在廠商方面看來，、仍據指數太高，不勝負担，甚至有時，連薪工也發不出，以致引起勞資間的爭議。所以，我們不必高談闊論，說什麼影響國計民生；就是為安定上海人民的生活討　這種畸形的經濟現象，也不能許其長此持續下去的。</p>
<p>挽救當前經濟危機的辦法，當然也是不一而足的；但是最易收效的辦法，似乎莫過於南北物資交換。誰都知道，中國的經濟是整個的有機體，不容割裂；是現在因為內戰的緣故，南北隔離，物資不能交流，有如人體中的血液，不能循環；不論在北方，或在南方　都感到偏枯的痛苦。換句話說，本市工商業固然需要北方的燃料及原料；就是北方也需要本市的製成品。南北物資如能交換，則雙方均受其益；反之，雙方都要感到偏枯的痛苦，北方人民的生活固然無法改善，就是本市的工商業也不能從蕭條走向繁榮。從此更可以看出，和半對於經濟的重要，萬一不幸北平的和談不能成功，則一切有關國計民生的大計，都是談不上的　僅靠南北物資交換，也是不會使本市工商業立即脫離困境的，如何發展本市的工商業，還是應該從根本上着手。</p>
<h3>陶希聖任在穗分析時局　本週為和談關鍵　中共如渡江中國將遭原子彈烽火　蔣總裁支持全面和平決不赴廣州</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十一日電〕中央黨部十一日舉行紀念週，主席李委員宗黃，領導行禮後，由中宣部陶副部長希聖，對當前時局加以分析。陶氏首稱：本星期為和談之關鍵，和談在原則上能否達到協議，卽為本星期以內之事。此次和談關係重大，國家存亡，人民生活，世界安危，皆取決於其成敗，如和談能達到全面的公正的和平，則中國不至滅亡，人民可以休息，第三次世界大戰在遠東之危機，可以緩和，中國亦不至成為戰塲，如中共迫使政府投降，或以軍事渡江，則中國之國家生存，人民之自由生活方式及遠東之安全，皆受其威脅與破壞，第三次世界大戰必將提早到來。中國於八年抗戰三年變亂之後，又遭逢原子彈戰爭的烽火，其慘痛將為歷史上空前所未有。陶氏繼稱，民主國家防備侵略之陣綫正在結成，中共已發出宣言，將在第三次世界大戰之中帮助蘇俄作戰，中共此種製造中國戰塲之企圖，促成太平洋民主各國及亞洲大陸各民族之反共聯合陣綫使其早日實現，倘如中共破壞和談，或為迫使政府投降而進軍渡江，則中國一千二百萬方里領土及四萬萬人口，無論在何地豎起中華民國反侵略的旗幟，立卽受到民主世界之支持，但是本黨今日之方針在支持李代總統何院長爭取全面公正和平，而切望其成功。誠如蔣總裁去年十月底對外國記者所說：「中國決無意藉世界人類共同之災禍，以解決中國間問題」。須知第三次世界大戰如果發生，中國必將為一大戰塲，縱令中國問題在世界問題中得到解決，中國人民之痛苦犧牲何堪設想。基於此一理由，蔣總裁在元且文吿中重申和平方針。本黨今日仍依據此一方針，政府誠意謀和之努力，其目的在阻止中共引導中國為蘇俄打仗之企圖。最後陶氏說明蔣總裁之態度稱，將總裁以在野之身，支持政府爭取全面和平，並期望其成功。總裁決不到廣州來，外傳本黨將召開五中全會由總裁來穗主持，全非事實，總裁為本黨之領導者，但和戰大計全由李代總統何院長決定。</p>

<h3>禾預幹團叛部陸續歸來　吳興人心轉安定　一學員發表自白書述受騙經過</h3>
<p>〔本報吳興十日訊〕嘉興靑年預備幹部訓練團，一部份學員約計八百餘名，携械抵達本縣境內後，治安當局派隊防堵，情勢緊張，人心惶惶，幸該學員經過之處，未與地方團險接觸，故無戰事發生，在各鄉鎭自動繳械遣送來湖者，巳有一〇二名，均送嘉興原團，其主力部隊，近在武康三橋埠，有入天目山情形，尙有散在埭溪，梅峯，長超，南潯等鄕鎮之異動學員，一區專署於九日派郎副司令前往招撫，予以自新，城區緊張情勢，日漸和緩，各娛樂塲所均已照常營業，人心亦轉安定。據其中一學員易開泰，在南潯時提出自白書，面呈陳鎭長，其原文如下：「事在四月六日下午十時，忽然傳來一個很緊張的空氣，說是今晚要演習戰備行軍，於是我就很快的包好行李，接着就是發武器彈藥，整理一切所需要携帶的東西，把不便携帶的東西，寄往附近的老百姓家裏，可是大門戒嚴，無法拿出，祇好丟在營房裏，等待出發。可是謠言紛紛，什麼「奉令開往福建成江西等地」，又是什麼「戰備行軍大約須時三日」等等，倒弄得我們莫明其妙。在天將明之時，吃完了早飯，又傳說十五十六兩隊因目的不明而不走，但是我們隊上的同學，也有少數的同學主張不走，但大多的意見，說這是命令，我們也不知到底是幹甚麼，我們不去，恐怕是要受到處罰的。軍令之下達，是總隊長「戰備行軍」，我們學員是摸不淸總隊長的心理，不知他墨德上的變化，我們祇有聽命而往，總隊長是國家派定，我們的服從他，也就是服從國家，况且一個軍事訓練機關，戰備行軍，也是敎育中之一節課程。我們軍人以服從為天職，豈有不從之理。豈知他欺騙矇蔽了我們這一羣靑年，他的命令一變而來了野心的反叛行動，拿有熱血的靑年，變作他私人的資本，去為他的野心而　牲。可是我們有熱血，更有理智，在我們的心裏，祇有愛國家，為人民，我們有為人民大衆而犧牲之決心，而對　權利叛變之野心家，我們百難服從，故本人在行軍途中，得到「叛變」的消息，我卽離隊而別走，因聞嘉興已不凖我們入城，我決意返里回籍，躬耕養親，共敍天倫之榮，途經貴區，為責部同志所留，並云重返原部隊，　人無任歡迎之至。易開泰草此。』</p>
<h3>國會議員壓力下　美政府將考慮改變對華政策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕國會議負之反對國務院對華政策者，今日吿合衆社稱，彼等相信現巳有徵象，顯示美政府之對華觀念，可能轉移。民主黨參議員麥卡蘭稱，渠認為國會之壓力，將迫使政府考量若干改變。共和黨衆議員周以德稱，渠以為最近辯論經濟合作總署修正案，衆院外交委員會之答覆中，已公開廢棄所謂馬歇爾政策。</p>
<p>麥卡蘭謂，「我認為國務院於明瞭國會之態度時，該院將有更變，且應迅速有更變。國會近曾試圖從國務院取得關於政策之定義，由此可顯見國會之態度」。</p>
<p>周以德之言，係以外交委負會主席基依之覆語為根據，緣辯論時曾有質詢基氏者，「我人之意，是否為在此議案（將經濟合作總署五千四百萬美元款項之支付時間展長至一九五〇年）之下，不援助與共黨聯合之任何政府，而不論共黨是否控制該政府？」基氏答然。據周以德語合衆社稱，外交委會主席雖為民主黨員，但此言係承認中國方面與共黨聯合之政策，實屬錯誤，如果在目前為一錯誤，則過去必然亦屬錯誤。</p>
<p>周氏之假定，國會是否將予同意，僅能由表決確定之，惟衆參兩院均已以極大多數贊成票表決展長經合署之支款限期，藉以援助國民黨中國。</p>
<p>麥氏與周氏俱云，現有徵象，表示國會不同意於國務院之觀望政策。麥氏謂，最佳之證明厥為民主黨共和黨參議員各廿五人簽字於上月致國務卿艾契遜之函，力促予國民政府以新的軍事與經濟援助。其前又有共和黨衆議員五十一人致函杜魯門，請其就對華政策予以答覆。艾契遜曾在行政會議中兩黨議員談話，試予答覆。</p>
<p>國務院某員被請就所謂馬歇爾政策發表意見，據稱，基依之覆語中，並無新奇之處。該員復述及一九四八年三月十一日杜魯門之新聞記者招待會，會中有人問及馬歇爾之代表團及擴大國民政府基礎，是否有容納共黨之意。杜魯門答渠以為馬歇爾並無使任何共產黨員入中國政府之意，更稱，「我人若能為力，卽不欲中國或其他任何地方有共黨政府」。</p>
<p>國務院許多官員之態度為馬歇爾曾岡協助中國人解決糾紛，此企圖於馬歇爾離華時已吿終，其後卽截然為中國人之事務。但議員如麥卡蘭及周以德則抱不同之見解，謂國務院不顧國會之警吿，堅主國共聯合政府。</p>

<h3>建立德自治政府　三強計劃遭遇阻碍　德社民黨力主中央集權制</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十一日廣播：波恩訊，西德佔領軍當局重建德國自治政府之計劃，今日似已因德國社會民主黨這態度而遭受阻碍。社民黨於召開緊急會議後，已決定拒絕佔領當局建立一鬆懈的聯邦政府之計劃。該黨堅持立場，要求成立強有力之中央集權政府。該黨此項要求，已屢次為佔領當局所拒絕，惟該黨仍堅決不允讓步，此次重申立場，佔領當局頗感意外，因美英法三國佔領軍之政治顧問事前均預料該黨終必退讓也。社民黨發言人海因稱，該黨已讓步至無可再讓之地步，今後當由基督教民主黨採取妥協之步驟。</p>
<p>〔聯合社波恩十日電〕英美法三國聯絡官今日以德國佔領新法規遞交西德制憲議會長安特諾，並未舉行儀式。德政治領袖在安氏官邸研討半小時後，對此均無喜色，決在四十八小時後暫不發表意見。副議長索斐爾特面部通紅，社會民主黨領袖施米特與基督民主黨領袖凱斯普則其嚴肅。安氏已召集佔領法規委員會於十一日開會，審查此事。十二日委員會將與西德十一邦總理進行商談，然後於十三日由制憲議會發表公報。產議會十四日可派代表訪晤英·美·法三國軍事總督報告一切。</p>
<p>〔聯合社波恩十一日電〕德政治領袖對於西德佔領新法規表示冷淡。該法規雖給予德人在軍事安全範圍內享受最高程度之自治，但充滿限制與保留，「社會民主」報指摘盟國繼績管制德工商業研究，由於恐懼德人起而競爭。該報評稱，此舉實難容忍，唯有准許德人在技術發展工業，德國經濟始能在世界市場參加角逐，又盟國管制德國對外關係，將使德國無法在歐洲復興，或在聯合國取得平等地位。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十一日電〕廣播評論員皮爾遜昨晚宣稱，德國新佔領法規實施後，國際銀行行長麥克勞埃將繼績克萊而被任為美駐西德之高級專員。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖十一日電〕蘇聞建議戰前義國在非洲之殖民地，應置於聯合國託管之下，由蘇聯參與行政機構，美國對於此項建議表示反對。</p>
<p>美代表杜爾斯告記者招待會謂，蘇聯於星期六在聯大政委會中所提出之建議，係與渠本人與前國務卿貝爾納斯於一九四五年時提出者相同。惟杜爾斯指出彼時東西間關係並無目前之緊張情形，歐洲猶未為鐵幕所分隔，西歐經濟對歐洲以外來源之依賴性，猶未者目前之明顯與迫切。</p>
<h3>全英郡議會選舉　工黨承認慘敗</h3>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦十日電〕英格蘭與威爾斯郡議會上週辦理改選後，截至今日為止，據六十五地中五十五處點票結果，保守黨績佔優勢，一路領先已控制米特爾塞克斯，艾塞克斯及諾森伯蘭等郡。各地工黨力量大見削弱，共計失去二百五十三席，僅在桑莫特，杜蘭，格拉莫根，諾丁漢及卡馬登等郡保留控制權。</p>

<h3>菲極願成為　反共會議集會地</h3>
<p>以締結太平洋安全盟約</p>
<p>〔合衆社馬尼刺十一日電〕菲律賓極欲作為太平洋及亞洲各國間任何會議之會址，以建立包圍遠東共產主義之圍牆。菲律賓外部建議該國作為關心締結太平洋安全聯盟各國之集會地，此聯盟為菲總統季里諾最近所主張。菲律賓政府願將馬尼刺或巴基奧作為太平洋公約會議之會址。巴基奧特別適宜，因該處氣侯溫和，風景幽美，設備齊全。過去一年半中，該處會舉行兩次較小國際會議。</p>
<h3>依據平等互助原則　南願與蘇覓至妥協　南國人民陣綫發表宣言</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十一日廣播：貝爾格勒訊，狄托人民陣綫黨於大會閉幕時發表宣言稱：南斯瓣夫衹能在平等互助之基礎上與蘇聯及共產國際情報局覓致妥協。該黨大會之決議案稱：南國人民陣在相互尊互諒精誠合作之基礎上，為建立社會義國家間良好關係而努力。該決議並謂南斯拉夫將繼績反對「戰爭販子的帝國主義者，」此點顯係抨擊西方國家</p>

<h3>游擊隊發動新攻勢　希呼籲盟軍干涉　暗殺希顯要陰謀被破獲</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典十日電〕官方今日宣佈，希臘游擊隊已向格蘭莫斯山區發動新攻勢。希軍總司令部發表公報稱，叛軍進攻着洛斐特·奧克約斯等村落，然被擊退。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典十日電〕雅典電台今日要求希臘境內之盟軍出面干涉。廣播中述及「在阿爾巴尼亞領土中凖備之格蘭莫斯山區侵略」時稱，盟國如欲維護和平，必須迅速採取行動。極權國家侵入希領地九年以後，希臘仍繼績為其領土完整與政治獨立而戰。然僅獲得物資援助之希軍今日在其奮鬥之中，正遵守國際條約，而此等條約所規定之限制，使其無法追擊侵略者至其基地一如一九四〇年義侵入時所為者。因此自由人民之希望不應失望，盟軍應在戰地採取行動，一如一九四〇年希望在阿爾巴尼亞獲勝後彼等在非洲採取行動。</p>
<p>〔路透社雅典十一日電〕希臘公安部宣布，已捕獲企圖暗殺顯要人物之共黨人八十名。暗殺之目標包括美駐希軍事團長佛利時少將·希外長蔡爾達理斯·及希陸軍參謀長等。該案於一個月前卽已破獲，但各被捕之供辭至最近始獲全。當局於獲悉此陰謀後，卽通知美國安全軍，並加意保護佛氏之安全。</p>

<h3>尼赫魯將向聯邦會提出　英印關係新計劃　印度獨立後與英仍保持聯繫</h3>
<p>〔合衆社新德里十日電〕據十日自可靠方面探悉：印度總理尼赫魯將赴倫敦參加四月廿一日的聯邦總理會議，對印度與英聯邦的示來關係有所建議。據可靠方面稱，尼赫魯在印度國會工作委員會中舉出此兩項建議：（一）承認印度人民的國籍，每一印度人民將具有雙重國籍，卽同時為印度共和國及英聯王國的公民；（二）印度獨立以後與英聯邦繼績保持聯繫的計劃。據稱，印度正凖備制定某種公式，在此項公式下，英王將保留聯邦的第一公民資格，但在其他事務上，其地位與印度共和國總統相等，故指派印度外交人員者，將為印總統而非英王，在印度的英國公民當效忠印度總統（為英王之代表），在英國的印度公民，則當效忠於英王。</p>
<h3>戰爭如爆發　印不擬參戰</h3>
<p>尼赫魯對記者談話</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十日電〕印度總理尼赫魯今日在新德里向每日郵報記者談稱，如果戰爭爆發，印度未必參戰。尼氏承認，「如果戰爭在任何地點爆發，諒將波及全球，印度為其利益關係，或須參戰，但將視環境而定。友善的印度，與其他共和邦關係良好，將較諸印度所能供給之有限軍事協助，對其他共和邦更有價值。印度現猶如其他共和邦，可避不參加或許牽涉聯合王國之任何戰爭。歐洲向為中心所在，而亞洲僅為世界重心之邊緣，但亞洲尚未成為重大農民運動之所在地，此可於亞洲許多國家之紛擾狀況中覘之」。尼氏又稱，共和體制之印度，不難適合共和邦範圍，因需要變更者，僅方式而已。</p>
<h3>緬總理泰金諾　訪晤尼赫魯</h3>
<p>過加城表示叛亂卽可解決</p>
<p>〔聯合社新德里十日電〕官方今日宣布，緬甸總理泰金諾將於十二日來此訪問印度總理尼赫魯，商請協助　向英國要求　借款事宜。</p>
<p>〔路透社加爾各答十一日電〕緬甸總理泰金諾，應印度總理尼赫魯邀訪問新德里，今日途經此地時談稱：緬甸局勢今已完全在政府控制中，渠相信全國普選可能在七月間舉行。泰氏表示對尼赫魯氏之關切緬甸局勢，極為歡迎，此去將與尼氏詳細討論緬甸局勢。泰氏謂，加倫族之叛亂，上月氣焰極盛，今已面臨崩潰，渠相信於七月間舉行普選時，各政黨均將盡力參加競選。一記者詢以緬甸之叛亂支持多久？泰氏答曰：短期內卽可解決。並曰，印度與英國若能以大宗軍火配備援緬，卽可使緬境之叛亂迅速敉平。</p>
<h3>杜魯門將向國會栗求　加速批准大西洋公約　康納利主軍援費用應力求縮減</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕參院外委會會主席康納利十一日稱，重行武裝歐洲的費用，必須「僅可能予以減縮。」杜魯門可能在十一日晚要求參院加速批准大西洋公約，該項行動必將引起關於獲悉美國軍火援助西歐計劃的全部情報的新要求。</p>
<p>康納利稱：「軍火援助計劃必須與馬歇爾計劃，防衛計劃及其他資用相配合，此係一個大整體，而必須妥作處理，俾吾人不將使任何計劃與其他計劃衝突，或陰礙其他計劃。」康納利稱：「全部及公開」聆取大西洋公約，大致需時一個月。參院外委會將在十八日開始聆取該約，參院通過該約所需的三分之二票數，大致絕無問題。</p>
<h3>日斑擾亂電訊　東西聯絡受阻</h3>

<h3>美國為什麼失勢於亞洲</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室物譯稿</p>
<p>美國漸漸失勢於亞洲，從華北到爪哇海，反美情緒激盪着，寢假蔓延至其他各處。最大原因在於美國扶助日本先於其他各國。對華政策的不當，亞洲共產黨的活躍，亦為削弱美國勢力的主因。亞洲人對於山姆叔叔的好感和友善，從此消失。代之而起的是猜疑和憤懣。</p>
<p>美國人在東方漸漸失面子。在第二次世界大戰期間積儲起來的美國的善意底仁澤，快要涸竭了。在居住着十億人口的廣大地域裏，他們在幾年以前對於美國所表示的近乎英雄崇拜的好感，現在漸漸變成深惡痛絕了。</p>
<p>「美國新聞與世界報告」的訪員最近遊歷遠東，歷時八閱月，從日本，中國，橫渡南太平洋，穿過印度和阿拉伯國家而至地中海。他從這區域裏所獲得的一般印象是：亞洲人對於美國的迷夢的醒悟—痛切而澈底。</p>
<p>亞洲的有思想的人們都在擔心着美國政策旨在重建日本，他們憤慨美國的對華政策，猜疑美國在爭取國家獨立的印尼，越南和其他地域的動機。一般人感覺美國政策—或者是缺乏綜合性全面性的亞洲政策，不僅離間了十億友人和有力的盟國，而且促使幾百萬岐途徬徨的人民傾向到共產黨那邊去。</p>
<p>亞洲民族對美仇視</p>
<p>亞洲民族對於美國的不信任日益加深。一位跋涉萬里的訪員不時有人問他：「美國為什麼要棄信於亞洲民族」？第一個提出這問話的是一位日本經濟學家，他由隱居出山協助佔領任務，但是因惑於美國政策和行動，在一年以後，便又隱退不幹。又有一位韓國勞工領袖在遇刺以前不久，也提出同樣的問題。</p>
<p>用大同小異的字眼提出這難解的問題的，尚有一位中國哲學家，（他以祖國的騒亂歸咎於美國）一們菲律賓新聞記者，一位在法屬越南擔任地下工作的本地工程師，一位印尼學生，一位緬甸政治學家，和一位印度教授。</p>
<p>在日本潰敗時期，這許多人盡是美國的熱烈崇拜者。這種崇敬心理現在差不多已經消失了。在鬧着饑饉，生活水凖低落，同時發生政治上的不安的東方的廣大地域裏，對於美國的友善逐漸冷淡下去。對各階層作仔細的考騐和幾百次的訪問以後，指出了遠東問題的癓結所在。</p>
<p>在過去一二年中，由於美國對日政策的趨向，亞洲各地人民加深了對於美國的仇視。各黨　派的中國人深恐美國恢復日本的作戰力量。那位記者在一星期中聽到一位行政院長，一位商人，一位勞工領袖，一位新聞記者和一位銀行家先後表現過這種恐懼。他們一致覺得在混亂的東方建立起一個強盛的日本，實有保全昔日發動戰爭的讀武者實力的傾向。</p>
<p>不獨中國人如此，菲律賓人對於美國在日本的政策甚至更為痛恨。菲律賓人覺得戰敗國現在搖身一變而為戰勝國，而戰勝國反被當做戰敗國看待。</p>
<p>大多數的亞洲人都很重視美國對於蘇聯的關切。他們所疑懼的是：美國欲使日本變成抵禦蘇聯的壁壘，却忽略了昔日仇敵的民主化。他們相信日本縱然可以強盛起來，但是很可能不會趨於民主化的。</p>
<p>結果，菲律賓等處人民對於美國的好感，逐漸顯示了消退的迹象。由於菲人覺得美國對於日本的復興，較諸對於菲律賓的復興更加關心，在美國准許菲島獨立時對於美國的無限熱忱是漸漸衰微了。</p>
<p>對華政策因循坐誤</p>
<p>像在東方其他各地一樣，中國人對美國的尊重心日漸趨向下游。美國陷於不快的處境中。共產黨始終排斥美國對華政策，蔣總裁的非共黨反對派責備美國自第二次世界大戰以來以美援二十餘億美元保持蔣氏的權勢。現在連蔣氏最有力的支持者也漸漸仇視美國，指責美援太少太遲，不能阻止共產黨勢力的擴張。</p>
<p>「美國新聞與世界報告」訪員會經訪晤一位中國教授，他似乎表示了足以代表多數意見的一種態度。他一謨孫中山的信徒國民黨員，在中共發動冬季攻勢而節節勝利以前，他早已加入了反蔣陣綫。他對那訪員說：「你們美國應負延長中國內戰的責任。要是沒有你們干預，我們早已結束這流血的悲劇了，那是我們大家所馨香祝禱的。如果你們繼績支持蔣氏，美國將喪失所有的中國友人，而中共無論如何必能征服全中國。」（未完）</p>

<h3>購儲糧食會議決定　向國內外大量購米　七月起美援米有繼續希望</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市府秘書長陳良，於昨日下午三時，出席美國經合總署上海分署舉行之購儲糧食會議。據陳秘書長於會後接見記者時稱：會中決議事項如下：（一）決向國外洽購食米六萬二千噸。（二）向國內籌購食米六十萬担，決由主管機關或委託糧商籌購之。（三）七月份起，本市美援救濟米有繼續希望。美經合總署滬分署副署長曾以極愉快之口吻語出席會議之顏惠慶博士，對本市配米問題，美方願盡力予以協助云。</p>
<p>陳秘書長又告記者稱：關於米價問題，政府現行採取之方針，並非絕對管制政策，乃為溫和的，機動的，無危險性的，而加以適度之調節。並非市府無法硬性壓制米價，所顧慮者，加以高壓後，唯恐發生食米有無之問題。現各有關機關如國行，財政部，及美經合總署上海分署等，決取得密切聯繫，俾予米價以適度之調節。又據陳秘書長分析食米上漲之因素，係由於金鈔漲風之相互循環影響。蓋食米價格，昔日均有固定比率，大致均認為與五元美金及十元銀圓之價格相等。現美鈔及銀元價格既然不斷上漲，自然邇帶影響米價刺激上昇。渠又稱：警察局長毛森，因食米價格邇日狂漲，前日夜半十二時許，曾電陳秘書長，詢以對米商應否予以懲戒，陳秘書長當告以如米商尚無故意越超限價情事，逮補當可從緩。</p>
<p>又陳秘書長對抑平米價之意見為：政府可仿照英工黨現行之緩和社會主義方針，對食米一項，實行全面配給。現戶口米之配售已解決全市所需要量三分之二，其餘三分之一，求諸於自由市場。政府如設法實施全面配售，則可制止食米猛烈之漲風。</p>
<h3>五六兩月都市配糧　糧儲會完成三之一</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕五六兩月都市配糧，糧儲會正積極籌劃，已完成三分之一。京滬穗青四市配糧，五六兩月決繼續舉辦，共需食米十二萬九千公噸，麵粉一萬六千公噸，其來源洽定由中美雙方平均負担。我國方面籌劃迄今，已有食米二萬八千公噸，麵粉二千六百公噸準備完成，其餘數額亦正由糧購會積極設法中。又關於五六兩月都市配糧供應計劃，中美兩方已初步商定如下：（一）南京：月需食米四萬二千公噸，五六兩月由我國全數供給。（二）上海：月需食米四萬二千公噸，我方每月供給一萬九千七百五十公噸，餘數美方供給。（三）廣州：月需食米一萬三千五百公噸，我方每月供給三千三百七十五公噸，餘數美方供給。（四）青島：月需麵粉八千公噸，五月份全數由美方供給，六月份全數由我方供給。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕美援米八千五百噸於九日自暹運抵此間，以供上海配給之用。另一批食米計九千一百噸，預定於四月十八日交貨。此外在目前與六月卅日一段時間中，尚有食米九萬六千噸運華。刻在運華途中，或已核准採購之經合署食米，以及中國政府所規定採購之食米，足以保證繼續辦理配給至六月底。將在中國卸貨之食米，包括美國米三萬噸，其餘部份則將在東南亞採購。經合署運華之食米，將用以支持上海，廣州與汕頭之配給計劃。中國政府刻正完全自行辦理南京之配給，因南京比較接近本國產米區之故。又青島之配給，正由經合署之美國麵粉加以辦理。</p>
<h3>經濟會報今日舉行　商討抑平物價問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市府定今日下午三時，召集各有關機關，舉行經濟會報，商討抑平物價問題，對目前整個經濟問題將予研究。陳秘書長昨曾在曹家花園遇劉攻芸，林崇墉，李立俠等，對抑制當前物價漲風曾作密商。又據陳秘書長表示：渠將於今日會報中提出，建議中央請取銀元販子，俾免刺激物價上漲。以後之銀元買賣，可改由國行掛牌，委由各合法商店承辦之。</p>
<h3>商業登記手續　社局力求簡化</h3>
<p>市社會局近對於商業登記，力求簡化手續，儘量予市民便利。以前規定凡得承銷配給物資之工商行號於聲請登記時，應依照防止商民投機取巧準則規定，附送已登記同業兩家出具之保證證明書，茲因該項辦法，目前已不適用，徒然增加商民麻煩，業經提請本次市政會議通過廢止，自四月十一日起實行。並經規定自申請至發證期間，至遲為兩星期，若已向該局聲請登記而逾兩星期未獲領證通知者，可逕向該局第一處或工商登記所隨時註明收據號碼書面查詢。</p>

<p>搪瓷工業：主要原料為黑鐵皮等六種，第五六兩季配額美金十六萬元，僅及需要量約十分之二，此項原料市塲存底亦不豐，現存量只敷一個月之用。該業困難情形：（一）國外輸入原料，因停發出口證，無法裝船運來。（二）華北銷路停頓，製成品售價低於成本，各廠將陷於減工停工之境。（三）燃料柴油月需七百噸，目前僅配到十分之四，極感困難。該業希望：（一）請求政府寬放黑鐵皮之外匯限額，以便增加輸入，而維生產。（二）請社會局轉主管機關，速向美國駐滬商務參贊交涉，對各搪瓷廠向美國訂購之黑鐵皮從速發給出口許可證。（三）柴油配量不足，請轉函柴油分配委員會酌予增加。</p>
<p>製革工業：主要原料為（一）生牛皮（需要量一百萬磅），（二）生羊皮（需要量十八萬磅），（三）化學原料（拷膠等），皮類來源少，貨價高，現僅敷十二天之用，拷膠可用兩個域。請政府貸款儲購原料，並溝通華北來源。</p>
<p>調味粉業：原料為炭粉，燒碱，如儲存六個月原料，炭粉需三萬磅，燒碱需十七萬磅。該業困難：（一）燃料月需八百噸，存煤不足。（二）黃金不敷週轉。該業要求：（一）寬放工貸範圍，准許將調味粉業列入。（二）增加配煤。（三）實現南北物資交流。</p>
<h3>孫克强等貪污案　個別審訊無小時　章正武怒目叱駡當庭表示勒索情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前閘北警察分局局長孫克强，被控貪污瀆職，經市警察局連同其他三被告天勝橋派出所警士章良鑄，新成警分局警士章正武，共和路派出所警士金以清，一併解送地院羈押，昨晨十時由歐聲和推事首次開審，經五小時之個別審訊，下午二時退庭，諭待調查後再行審訊，各被告還押。</p>
<p>本案第一被告孫克强被控罪嫌為：（一）侵占該區冬防互助會捐款，（二）市民違章建築，曾有勒索情事，（三）包庇部署敲詐太陽寺僧任志言。昨並傳到任志言證述經過。庭上以本案情節匪輕，除採個別審訊，禁止各被告家屬及旁聽隨意出入，並婉拒記者攝取鏡頭，庭上空氣，一時益見嚴肅。</p>
<p>太陽寺僧證述歷歷</p>
<p>庭上首傳寺僧任志言供稱：渠出家已二十六年，十四年前，遵阿兄之意，與謝杏姑同居，初住於本市溫州路，戰時遷往甯波，戰後返滬住新民路，現住大通路，兩處均有戶口，而以謝為戶長。上月十一日深夜，與謝正在大通路住宿時，突有警察兩人，破門而入，手持電筒，氣勢洶洶，指渠被人密告通匪，並妨害風化，奉分局長命前來調查，如肯交付兩根金條，即可了案。繼則翻箱倒櫃，大事搜索，渠當以所有四千元現款及金戒兩只交付後，仍被縛押至大通路派出所，至十二日上午十時，解往閘北分局司法股審訊，及晚始交保獲釋。供畢，庭上命將四被告提押到庭，由任指認章正武收取贓物，章良鑄及金以清，均在門外等候，另一穿黑色大衣者係領路人章志芳，則與章正武同宗。</p>
<p>庭上覩狀不覺大怒</p>
<p>繼由章良鑄答供：三月十一日晚，孫分局長電話派出所巡官王傑，接辦本案，適王不在所內，渠當奉命至孫家，交下密告信，囑往查辦，渠遂會同共和路派出所警士金以清前往，並由領路人章志芳介紹新成分局警士章正武，邀往協助，到任家後，渠及金在門外等候，由志芳·正武兩人上樓，旋渠亦上樓查詢，該僧與謝杏姑初稱為舅甥關係，後改稱為夫妻，且無身份證，形跡可疑，遂欲帶局，該僧即以四千元及金戒二只行賄求饒，當予拒絕，連同贓物帶局作證。章正武供稱：雖未奉主管命令，查辦本案，但以該僧有通匪嫌疑，故允同往協助。庭上嗣令渠與任志言相對而立，表演當晚勒索情形，章則以威脅態度，對任怒目而視，並罵任「不要放屁」。庭上覩狀，不覺勃然大怒。</p>
<p>矢口否認被控各節</p>
<p>嗣審訊金以清一過後，提孫克强供稱：渠所接之密告信，係黃德生所供給，稱任志言通匪圖謀不軌，且姦占其妻，並稱任與該區共和路派出所巡官郭某取得聯絡，故改令天勝橋派出所派員往查，對於被控包庇部屬敲詐及案發後阻止各犯解送總局各節，均矢口否認，對渠及該局司法股所作調查報告書互異一點，辯稱因係雙方所根據之口供不同所致。</p>
<p>關於該區組織冬防互助會，向商民募捐收支各節，孫供稱：冬防互助會係地方人士於去年十二月建議組織，總局雖未明令准予募捐，但在會報中曾經提出報告，先後共募四萬餘元，其中一萬餘元由義警經收，餘款由該區巡官徐揚保管，支出則由渠經手，賬中支出兩筆，一為七，二〇〇元，一為一一，七〇〇元，是否為渠支用，現已忘記。經募之款中，曾購汽油兩桶，一桶交局，一桶尚在保管中。</p>
<p>尚須調查改期再審</p>
<p>庭上詢以公物為何存於私人家中？且在今年三月案發後尚未交出？孫稱因該局遠處閘北，在市區購油後，即就近存渠家中，且因所購之油，有人稱油價過昂，渠令經手人將單據呈報，故遲遲未送局。至被控對市民違章建築，勒索受賄，則完全否認，據稱該區難民過多，隨時搭蓋棚屋，殊有不勝取締之概。最後傳訊該區總務股長季秀成，巡官徐揚及太豐紗廠科長許兆珍，對於冬防互助會所募之捐款，均稱交由孫負責支配，惟對如何支配，則並不知情。至此，庭諭尚須調查，改期再審，下午二時退庭。</p>

<h3>草原招塊！　（下）</h3>
<p>— 蕭賽</p>
<p>「九日康幹土人獻牛歡迎，我們去宣慰他們，反受他們宣慰，雖然大打牙祭，良心上却不舒暢。十日活佛請求派醫去給他的佛友看病，我同去阿摩卡塞，活佛三點鬍子，活像戲台上演奸臣的角色，他害關節炎，走路要用拐杖，將後獎銀一枚。」</p>
<p>「十一日在舌野可盆地裏落寨，天降雪雹，相傳昔有女神藏山仁執，遇毛牛溝經商壯男，苟合後，謊以抵家後迎接，女神被騙後，立誓凡遇毛牛溝男人過此，卽遣雪彈致死，我們同行中，冷有毛牛溝二人，於是我們就好像陪了殺塲。」</p>
<p>「十二過房垢那窩山，十三到阿仲猛，人烟漸稀，十四日用木筏渡喀溪河，康克明舊屬百姓獻羊獻魚，晚上吃得個個喊飽，魚味也天有繞樑之槪，十五過大慶烟額（大馬尾巴原之意）產馬區，大馬溝小馬溝馬羣甚健，這裏寨子有四百餘戶，全為阿曲格勒寺院管轄，馬團長宣慰政府關懷草地五十二部落之意」</p>
<p>渡熱可河</p>
<p>十七過熟可河。近水記着這一帶的山歌有：「水，衛來可怕，可繞走。天上雨，無法躱。自巳的士官，害怕他也可躱，天作之合，無法躱。」七日，經火文玉黎公山，若摩岩，甘多　鴿，十七至貢馬桑，歡迎詹近水，他們席地打坐，吃葡萄干，麻餅，冰糖，酸辣包子，會見康克明十九歲的情婦折彼，他記着：「我們談這些私事，是把門關起來，免得他的老百姓竊聽，」但是他又記着：「言歸正傳，政府給康土官的把柄，都燬於馬步芳的兵燹。」同時還記着馬步芳搶去牛馬留下遺跡的事，此外一些人民採風參觀寺院，接受牛羊，地方生活素描，為夷少攝影瑣事，都無足輕重，近水遇害前曾在蓉新新新聞」連續發表過他的「草地行」。</p>
<p>期望劃界</p>
<p>他們在貢馬桑的席地宴會上還大唱其歌，折波唱的是：「酒一瓶未敬一尊菩薩，彈一袋未打一個敵人，滿懷心腹事，只有一人知。」康土官唱的是：「大地的衣裳是太陽，大衆的食糧是莊稼，人人怕他，人人敬他，那就是蔣總統了！」從他的歌裏充滿了痛恨馬步芳，和請求政府劃界的熱忱，連近水也不禁唱着「天上的太陽像經轉，地下的花朶係織錦，」等等。</p>
<p>上達兒塘的白衣寺，有黃鸞帶的和尙迎接，寺裏的活佛對他們客氣，說對政府關懷非常感謝，對大家跋涉非常感激，但以邊地窮苦，沒有好招待，引為抱歉。又說：「三果洛之屬於四川是鐵定事實布望政府早日劃界，以絕狼心，重見光明。」</p>
<p>近水記着：「太太的電問我何時可返，要走的路還長，當在重九以後，想覆回電，時電台已經折毀。」</p>
<p>七月二十四日離開貢馬桑馬團長則留守此地，折波隨行，大唱其歌，大賽其馬。過二河口，轉向西北順瑪爾河而上，經紅竹子山，鄭重牛馬山，二十六日渡黃河，他記着芳酒的事情，後來，詹太太（詹吳秋水）接到他最後一封便是在過河時寫的，第二天發電機的燈泡壞了，從此無法向成都發出急電。</p>
<p>當地的敎育，他記得很有趣味：「學生陳英，十七歲，姿色不惡，某夜被土官召幸」，以及他們接到些藏文狀子。</p>
<p>犬羊不留</p>
<p>相傳靑海方面已派來二三十人，帶有無綫電台，和界碑，近水八月四日的日記上說：「大槪是來劃界的了，道路傳聞雖不足信，但把我們弄糊塗了。據郭先生說，靑海的同德縣，距離貢馬桑只有三馬站口，那裏的韓專員，據說可能來和我們交涉關於紅摩桑的事」。在這種地苦事繁之際，近水寫着他想起「萬里風塵常作客，不知何日返故園」？的詩來。他說：「這眞是給我們一羣身覊西番的人們寫照了」。</p>
<p>「八十七日過詣曲桑，看跳神。八日夜聽馬舍桂說二十七年馬步芳派藍隊長駐白寺納草頭稅，番人不願，將藍活捉，驅作馬騎，一步一鞭，迫至黃河，藍求死之苦，已難筆墨形容，翌年馬派二騎營入俄洛，殺得犬羊不留」</p>
<p>鹽湖剖腹</p>
<p>八月九日日記，是他最後的日記了，以後便無文字記載。是日也：「天雨，帳上瀝瀝作聲，催牛催馬，不絕於耳，悶煞人也。十時半起身，十五里到唐咳裏鵬山頭，高四八三〇公尺，回首蕩吉浦多平原，眞是廣大，山下便是紅糜桑的地界，以外，便無人烟了。草長，無牛無馬，眞可惜一片大好原野，到×××溝（原文空白）後，遠望白黑點點……」</p>
<p>此外，便是「三果洛事件」。</p>
<p>因為當康克明土官回到他的地方，才知道自己的百姓遷走了一百多家，草地裏土官的力量是靠百姓的多少而定，百姓多收入豐，武力强，百餘家百姓為什麼他遷，則非簡單問題。因想到馬團長為省府要員，有力量有地位的人，求其將遷走至靑海省境內之百餘家招回，馬團長想建樹自己在草地的聲譽，允其請求，卽派口齒淸銳，身健體壯之團員四人，（有秘書詹近水在內，他給他太太的信上說是馬團長苦勸他為國前往。）通司二名，護送之小士官數人前往，同時拍電省府請示可否前往。被派團員們經六七天的千辛萬苦，始達靑海轄管之新川設治局，交涉無結果，據稱：該地仍無一漢官，希望他們再走一天的路，到鹽湖上去，他們為奉命派遺希望得一結果，不畏辛勞又前往鹽湖，誰知去後，卽全都被扣。團長此刻尙留貢馬桑坐享安樂，土官的佳餚美酒，　情招待，獲悉團員被扣後，始報吿省府，八月中旬才有兩個護送的番兵跑回來，向團長報吿，他們親眼看見護送的小土官被槍殺，對被扣的人說「晚上卽可放你們回家，槍馬都還你們，請你們先把收條寫來吧」！晚上當地的西番與被逃回之西番有親戚關係，吿之：「速逃，否則今晚將有不幸事件發生」。於是這兩個西番買了兩匹馬，卽逃走，後聞朱逃走之西番均槍斃，漢人則剖　沉於鹽湖中矣！</p>
<p>而馬步芳的覆　是：「對宣慰團團負被洛地方庇護人犯拉洛，並擬擾亂同德，該省為自衛計，乃拒絕彼等入境，至川省宣慰團，應在川省境內，且宣慰劃界並非一省所能辦，况本省（靑海）境界早已劃淸，更不勞跋涉，且果洛距松潘二十餘站，距同德十餘站，遠道行軍宣勞，更屬不解，至寬慰人員被害事，我方更不知道，最好設法將川省部隊電召調回，以免事態擴大而靖邊防，刻此項電文已留着解決三果洛事件之參考。」</p>
<p>馬團長在貢馬桑等了一個月，毫無下落，只好往回走，報上說他：「馬團長家居松潘，目的不同；在松潘，人們聽說宣慰團在草地醫病，盤尼西林每針五十個「袁世凱」，九一四每注射一針二十個「袁世凱」，此行馬團長，除狐皮，牛馬，銀元外，可說別無收穫，因為草地裏的土官對天官，為表示尊敬，重禮為唯一表示，只苦了馱牛，讓狐皮和袁世凱壓得他喘不過氣來！土官贈送的肥牛壯馬，編成了隊伍，過一寨收一寨，為了避免他人的耳目，收到牛馬就地賣去，他到松潘後所有者僅馬十餘匹，牛十餘頭，聽說尙有兩匹已牽到成都，不知又是誰的財喜。」</p>
<p>團長被扣</p>
<p>一九四九年一月十九日，馬必杰回來了，遇害四家慶把這位身穿狐皮，頭戴狐帽，大有蠻王之慨的馬團長扣留住，由詹吳秋水，莫李萬榮，王開元，劉世燦等家屬，要他算淸血案，拿話來說。</p>
<p>團長一時東指西劃，結果由近水生前友好新聞界的朋友蜀中謝趣生，張君特，馮雪樵，章伯懷等窮追之下，呌他取保，由省參議會的正副議長向傳義何宋述保證。</p>
<p>報上雖然有人狂呼：「草原啊！你是畏途」！但三果洛事件在這大時代中恐又將成為滄海一粟了！</p>
<h3>武義氟礦區踏勘　（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　蔣風</p>
<p>〔本報金華五日訊〕氟石原名Fluorite，賜於等軸晶系的礦物，常呈美麗的立方晶體，透明的很多，光澤似玻璃，具有四方向的完好斛理。因礦石本身主要成分含有氟元素，故名氟石。又因其加熱後能發生綠光如螢，通常稱綠螢石。氟石顏色普通以綠色為多，鄕民多呌綠石頭。其實，氟石之顏色，不僅綠色，亦有黃，紫，淡藍，紅褐，灰等色，亦為無色的。氟石之主要用途，是作煉鐵的熔劑，及其他金屬之催溶劑，約占總產量之百分之八十以上；其餘如製爆炸藥，玻璃具，琺瑯具，搪瓷具等之主要原料，其質純而透明的，可以雕刻成各種器皿及裝飾品。</p>
<p>氟石的產地，除湖南臨湘，山東膠縣，熱河隆化及山西交城等地略有出產外以浙江為最著，產量亦最豐，占全國總產量百分之九十以上。以浙江而論，則以武義氟石礦之蘊藏量絞富，約計二〇〇〇〇〇噸，產區面積據估計約二四七九，〇〇公畝，常年產量平均二〇〇〇噸左右。</p>
<p>武義氟礦之表面岩層甚為淺薄，離地面數寸至三五尺，所以開採很易，早在九一八以前，當地居民偶然在開山時發見，因而開掘，旋知可以竇錢，乃由人工開掘，挑運至江邊，由武義江而下，經金華船運至杭滬出售，但產量不大。後居民發覺氟石之經濟利益甚大，因此羣起開採，但限人工開採及運輸倏件之制束，未有大規模之組織。及到民國二十三年，浙贛鐵路建築完成，運輸卽行便利，於是民營之礦商有組織公司，作較大規模之開採，但開採方法仍舊士法，產量亦不著。在抗戰前一二年，浙江省政當局，有意組織省營公司，籌措資金，購備新式開採機器，計劃初具，戰事發生，因此停頓。及三十一年，浙贛事變之後，金華武義等地相繼淪陷，敵人卽派遣專家來金武一帶勘察，並作詳密之調查，不及三月，卽計劃大規模開採，征集民工，興築金華武義間之輕便鐵道，直達礦區；並由日本運來開採機械，强拉民伕數千人，由偽華中礦業公司主持開採事宜。最盛之時，礦工曾達萬人，每日出產一千噸左右；經由金武輕便鐵道輸運至金華車站堆積，轉運去滬，當時金華站西礦地氟石堆積如山。敵人經營三年，盜去數量頗巨，約在五萬噸以上。</p>
<p>武義氟石礦之分佈，據當地調查資料，約有下列各區：</p>
<p>（一）石龍崗　：離城五里，通至水運口三里。脈寬平均二公尺，長度三百五十五公尺，已採長度一百九十五公尺，坑最深處二十八公尺，圍岩為流紋岩，儲量約五萬三千公噸，　石質中平</p>
<p>（二）陳範山　：離城五里，通至水口三里。與石龍崗同為一脈，脈寬平均一公尺七寸，長度二百零五公尺，已採長度一百十五公尺，坑最深處二十四公尺，圍岩為流紋岩，儲量約三萬五千公噸，質中平。</p>
<p>（三）金鈎山　：離城五里，至水口半里。與石龍崗同一脈礦，北部分為二支，平均寬一公尺二寸；已採長度三十公尺，南部寬度變狹，北部寬度未改，坑最深處八公尺，圍岩為流紋岩，儲量約四千公噸，質中平。</p>
<p>（四）周嶺　：離城五里，至水口四里。與石龍崗同為一脈，露頭長約一百公尺，寬一公尺四寸，圍岩為流紋岩，儲量約二萬一千公噸，質中平。</p>
<p>（五）五尾龍　：離城六里，至水口二里，脈寬六公尺，露頭一百四十五公尺，已採三十五公尺，坑深處十五公尺，圍岩為流紋岩，儲量約十三萬五千公噸，質中平。</p>
<p>（六）鵝頭　：離城二十里，至水口三里。脈寬平均一公尺二，已採十五公尺，北端未盡，南端已湮沒，坑深處十公尺，閣岩為流紋岩，儲量約一萬五千公噸，質中平。</p>
<p>（七）人形山　：離城二十里，至水口六里。脈寬一公尺四，已採三十公尺，坑深十公尺，圍岩為流紋岩，儲量約八千七百公噸，質尙佳·西端分三支，均西走。</p>
<p>（八）長蛇山　：離城二十里，至水口五里。脈寬一公尺八，巳採三十公尺，最深處十公尺，　岩為流紋岩，儲量約五千公噸，質差。</p>
<p>（九）干衣山　：離城二十里，至水口五里，脈寬一公尺，已採二十公尺，坑深三公尺，　岩為流紋岩，儲量給六千餘公噸，質佳。</p>

<h3>塲外黃金交易猖獗　國行昨又大量拋售　從四百萬大闊步退至三二五萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市塲，因取消漲跌限度，恢復自由買賣，尚未接奉正式訓令，致未實行，故交易依然停頓。上午開盤喊高至二七三萬七千漲停，有求無供，一無進出。午後仍在僵持之中，未迄收盤，入塲會員，均已先後離塲。</p>
<p>惟塲外交易益形猖獗，據記者探悉，交易分現貨和期貨二種。現貨交易，一律以當日本票交割，現進現出。期貨付二成保證金，每日不必收解，多空雙方只要貼息，打差金，隨時按市結價，交易頗為方便。因此各方趨之若鶩，進出之熱鬧，不亞於證券市塲。昨日市勢疾首猛退，官商鬥法白熱化。晨間因防有壓力，浮多有了，開盤三一五萬，三二五萬，一度降至三一〇萬，三二〇萬，中途因有發行大鈔之說，更以銀根仍鬆，證券幫金號幫哄高至三三五萬，三四〇萬。央行曾以三三〇萬拋出五六百大條，終因人心亟大挺，不敵各方之買氣，瀕午在北幫廣幫銀行幫競吸下，直綫飛升，市況一度混亂，自三五〇萬，三六〇萬午收一路漲至三八〇萬，三九〇萬，迫近四百萬大關。午後央行不肯示弱，以隔日頭存，討好顧客，無限制拋售，自三六〇萬，一路拋小至三二五萬，暗中共出三五千大條左右。今晨將有頭寸一百億左右軋進。期貨開盤三六〇萬，三八〇萬，步低至三一七萬，三二二萬，收盤三二〇萬，三二五萬，隔日多空貼息，每兩三二萬五千，結果較上日反軋小五萬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕國行業務局長林崇墉昨語記者，本日（即十一日）黃金市價又呈蠢動，國行為平抑金價計，特於上下午分別拋金共進一萬三四千兩之譜。上午拋出三四千兩，下午因聞黃金隔日交割價已叩四百萬元，故特再陸續拋售約近一萬兩之譜，把黃金市價壓低為每兩三二五萬元。（連當日利息在內）。</p>
<p>記者旋詢以金業市塲改組之訊，渠表示未有所聞。惟相信財政當局對此事當在研究中。至中央造幣廠改籌袁頭銀元送國行發行之說，林氏稱並無此事。至報載監委赴國行查詢之事，林氏亦稱尚未接洽。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀樓飾金，一日數變。上午掛三二〇萬，三五五萬，下午升至三三〇萬，三六五萬，較上日再漲七〇萬。飾銀高至三萬，四萬五，亦加五千。錢兌業蛤赤，當日現鈔交割，上午掛三五〇萬，三七〇萬，中午低至三三〇萬，三五〇萬，下午未更。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日美鈔塲外波動亦劇。晨開六萬八，七萬三，在供少求多下，一路升達七萬八，八萬三午收。午後交易清稀，最後當日交割，喊六萬五，七萬，稍有成交。隔日喊六萬八，七萬三。結果較上日無甚榮辱。</p>
<h3>市塲人心興奮　華股紛紛漲停　午後臨收走勢疲軟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕和談空氣，日趨明朗，市間銀根鬆象持續，股市人心，全面沸騰，冷熱門股，紛紛漲停。永紗晨開三三元，塲外空方已告氣餒，靜作觀望，塲內巨多再起軋空，於是買氣蓬勃，昂升至三六元五角。散戶顧慮拋壓，逢高傾吐，挫至三四元四角，旋聞新財經補充方案中有增發銀圓券之傳說，圈外黃金飛升，紗布騰踊，各幫一致扒吸，市勢瞬息卒變，銳氣猛晉，一路升至三七元二角漲停。</p>
<p>中小型股一致鋒铓，美亞初開九角四分漲停，午收依然站穩。新光臨收突俏，見二元五角九漲停。景福一元二角二二，亦告漲停。信和初開七元五角，嗣後升至七元九角二分漲停。勤興一元七角三分，亦登漲限。其餘雜牌股紛紛漲停。</p>
<p>午後初因頭寸仍鬆，黃金開盤仍昂，買氣連續，市勢步堅。嗣聞央行有拋金之訊，銀根緊勢微轉，臨收均告回軟。全日成交三一億六千四百八十五萬股。</p>
<p>黃金公債昨日市勢續升，銀根趨鬆，時局好轉，黃金現貨價格飛升，人心跟俏。晨開一一〇萬升至一二二萬，午刻高至一三二萬漲停板。成交四四兩。</p>
<p>下午初喊一三二萬買進，嗣因無人賣出，故無成交。</p>
<p>外股昨日市勢再起飛升，銀根呈鬆，金價疾進，各方買氣濃厚，怡紗九二〇〇〇元，九四〇〇〇元，續升一七〇〇〇元。英聯一〇三〇〇〇元，一〇六〇〇〇元，挺升一萬六千元。怡啤一七五〇〇元，一八五〇〇元，業廣三四〇〇〇元，三六〇〇〇元，亞洲九三〇〇元，九五〇〇元，各升一成光景。會德豐喊三十五萬，對敲上升九萬元。</p>
<h3>茶市交易不旺</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪茶業某鉅子，據告：際此各物連綿猛晉，幣值形貶落中，茶葉同業大都向外匯移轉證看齊，致最近茶市趨勢，跌吐秀氣。價格方面，瞬息千變，惟賣戶鑒於捉摸不定，咸懷袖手，交易遂乏實際，純係空喊居多。</p>
<p>又悉：目前華茶生產成本，依然高於國外市價，乃外銷漸瀕絕境，而今後茶價，如再翱翔，同業將呈外強中乾。同時向稱主要出口貨之茶葉，前途幾將危如　卵云。</p>
<h3>銀元壓倒金圓　市價日長夜大</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證交大樓，自從當日票據不准抵用以後，銀元對敲之宇號，無法活動。近日另闢途徑，改做金銀無物交換買賣，交易頗為熱鬧。昨晨金銀之比例，初為進一兩黃金換五一塊大頭，出一兩黃金換五三塊大頭。瀕午自五〇，五二，後小至四九，五一。小頭初做六五，七〇，中午退至六三，六八。午後又降至六〇，六五。鷹龍洋為九〇，九五。其他大頭換小頭八〇對一〇〇，大頭換龍鷹洋六〇對一〇〇。其他美鈔十元，換大頭十一元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元套匯，平津套匯，做每百元二元，見票遲一天付現貨，福州做出每百元三元，湘幫套做五天板期付現貨，每百元升二元。萬縣套匯，每百元升水五元至十元。出口商有尾差額套出，贛州幫套做每百元升水十五元，票匯遲七天交付現洋。</p>
<p>馬路交易，因外埠價格，均高出滬市頗多，各地來源，日見減少，人心思高，去化旺盛。大頭現鈔初做六萬二，六萬五，繼升至六萬六，七萬。午後市況一度混亂，喊高至七萬三，七萬八。傍晚因金價回落，小至六萬五，六萬九。小頭喊五萬四，五萬八。龍鷹洋喊三萬八，四萬三。本票交易，一度做七萬五，八萬。午後亦退至七萬，七萬五，一致較上日再加五千。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕馬路銀元價格，近日飛升至烈。據本報記者向各方面探悉其原因，據悉，自上週四起，各工廠傾力吸收，以備月中之發薪。蓋自上月底現鈔恐慌後，各工廠莫不以發薪時現鈔籌碼之缺乏為最難解決之事。本期現鈔緊勢，未曾稍戢，而月中瞬息即屆，故在初先吃進銀元，藉以減少發薪時之困難，此其一。工商行號，上午盈餘之分配，已多數開始發放，其發給官息紅利等等，折合銀元，已為最便捷之事，此其二。南京及蚌徐地區，銀元漲勢，較滬為烈，尤以前綫如鎮江等處，無不高於滬市。故昨日北站一帶，單幫携有大批現鈔，搜購販往。以昨日市況言，上午北高南低，下午一度北低於南，晚間又呈南低北高，此種趨勢，頗與單幫搜購有關，此其三。銀元券發行在即，一般心理，對於銀元更感興趣，此其四。外埠來源稀少，大量籌備，又以套匯關係，抽緊頗多，此其五。本市普通商店，均已兼營銀元買賣，並歡迎物物交換，銀元用途，益趨普遍化，此其六。銀元市勢，乃成瘋狂狀態。</p>
<h3>棉紗全面飛騰　布疋高檔結束</h3>
<p>昨日紗市波動甚烈，銀根與外象仍屬利買，有力大戶狂肆活動，本街複製業搜趨依舊踴躍，各紗在買氣籠罩之下，新高價層出不窮。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳由二二〇〇萬元直抵二七〇〇萬元收市，較週末狂升七五〇萬元，二一支雙馬現貨初以一一五〇萬元開出，曾低見一〇九〇萬元後，遂哄抬至一二七〇萬元結局，飛跳三二〇萬元，廠單最後與現貨軋落一萬元。</p>
<p>二〇支雙馬亦竄出大關，見一一八〇萬元新高，一六支各檔俱在一〇〇〇萬元左右成交，此外粗細各紗皆跳三成之譜。</p>
<p>棉布新高續現，良以市上銀根仍鬆，且外埠物價奔騰，故客幫買意堅強，本街亦不甘落後相機扒吸，各布初開平穩，與隔日塲外喊價放佛，開後曾落疲途，九時半後，聞黃金開盤報漲，人心轉告振奮，終以高檔結束。</p>
<p>龍頭細布由三十七萬五千元開出後，盤旋良久，近午突破大關，創四十三萬元新高峯，最後做四十二萬五千元，較週末猛升十萬元。</p>
<p>四君子嗶嘰自三十七萬低至三十五萬二千元，最高達四十萬〇三千元，終為三十九萬八千元，暴漲八萬三千元。後市猛漲暴落，初開龍頭細布四十九萬元。四君子嗶嘰四十六萬元，中途曾各見飛躍。嗣傳和談前途樂觀，南京物價慘瀉四成，人心乃告渙散，最後前者做四十七萬元，後者四十三萬六千元，收後再見削碼。</p>
<p>紗建售紗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡建公司昨續代國行及美援會售紗，共售六二七件，價值五五九〇〇〇萬元。開售經過如次：（一）廿支雙喜等開四〇四件，價各九二〇萬元，請購一〇三戶，五四五件，准騰四〇四件。（二）廿支翔鳳等開二七七件，價各八四〇萬元，請購四九戶，二二三件，照配。</p>

<h3>人絲曲折向上　綢貨漲達限度</h3>
<p>生絲昨晨開優級另擔，為二千萬元。十時許，勢呈盤旋，無分輊軒。十時後，由於金鈔報升，隨之上升至二一〇〇萬元，較上週六約升五〇〇萬元，惟成交不多，僅十擔左右。</p>
<p>人絲昨天橋興斯尼絲，晨開即期升至一一二〇萬元，旋因買氣不濃，價又回小，故今票初做一一四〇萬元，嗣因國行並未拋售黃金與物資，人心大定，買氣復濃，價乃直綫向上，終以一三八〇萬元午收，較週六升二三〇萬元。</p>
<p>綢緞昨華強被面，初開即升至市塲規定二成漲限，以七四一六〇〇〇收束，買氣猶濃。塲外交易一度升至八四〇萬元，旋又回小至八二〇萬元為最後價，其餘均乏問津，交易稀少。</p>

<h3>產價激升人心堅俏　食米暴漲三成　白粳薄稻做四十三萬元</h3>
<p>昨日米市以產地價格激升，人心極堅，且週日金鈔一日數漲，執戶蓄意急起直追，開市力予扳高，各檔貨一律暴跳三成。白粳薄稻升做四十三萬，現款亦達三十八萬元，市塲供應極稀，交易清淡。北市情形相仿，兩市塲到貨共六千餘石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>漲勢依然熾烈，開市受週日國外各物激升影響，各牌粉一律疾晉二成餘，中市聞央行有大量拋出，貨主乘高吐售，市勢一度急轉直下，收市後黃金繼續報漲，人心頓轉緊張，市勢再告奔騰。老車高喊十四萬五千元，兵船升達十四萬一千五百元。</p>

<p>食油</p>
<p>連日暴漲，昨日後市已見回頭，緣因金鈔報小，廠方大量拋出，廠豆油晨開高達二百四十萬，收市退做二百卅萬。較上週六微升十萬元。生油供應較稀，挺升一成，生菜油一度高至二百十五萬，後市退守二百大關，豆餅先平後堅，長字餅十二萬六千收市。</p>

<h3>市塲散步</h3>
<p>討論房租跟指數何故要嚴密關防</p>
<p>市政府最近曾開「臨時市政會議」；關防十分緊密。道有什麽重大議案，原來不過是要通過「房租照指數調整」的辦法，順帶便又通過了「房捐也照指數調整」的決議。事後迄今，關防還是十分吃緊。據說，恐防社會反對，害得市參議會不便通過。手續上，這類事項，非經市參議會通過，不算數。所以未提出市參議會之前，未在市參議員羣中安排妥密之前，關防非嚴不可！</p>
<p>據說，房租要照指數調整，是市參事室的建議。不久之前，各報傳出這個消息時，本人就在這裏有所指謫過。但房地產業主方面對市參事室的建議，表示還不滿意。房租照指數調整，他們「不反對」，但市參事室提議的底數，他們認為「太低」。表明市參事室並非同大房東站在一條陣綫上。當然，市參事室應和大多數市民站在一條陣綫上，不應和最少數的大房東一鼻孔出氣的。市民真是託福得很。那末為何關防要如此嚴密呢？</p>
<p>憶自八一三戰起，房租就開始嚴密管制。十多年來，當局的一切管制都失敗，唯一管制有功的便是房租。假使沒有這一點成功，全體市民和工商界，比現在還不知道要苦多少哩！</p>
<p>上海共有市民五六百萬，大房東最多不過二三千人。若然讓房租也像物價一般增加，許多工商業要關門，更多數市民會趕到房　下，睏到馬路上去了。</p>
<p>抗戰一發生，大房東對房客就下辣手，所以中國當局租界當局，爲了安定民居，就出而管制房租，淪陷時期，敵偽當局，也重視民居非安定不可，蕭規曹　着，勝利迄今，市長雖僅二易，大房東要解除房租管制的活動，不知已有多少次。但市政當局都曉得茲事體大，放鬆不得。特別是市參議會，對於房租問題，終能仗義執言，迎頭痛擊。所以直到現在，太平無事，全體市民和工商界，託福匪淺。</p>
<p>現在，市參事室建議房租照指數調整，可謂「輕舉妄動」，「膽大非凡」。然也知茲事體大。雖則市長不在，他們却起勁之至。究不知所為何來？</p>
<p>憑市參議會過去對於房租問題的嚴正態度來推斷，這次不致也會例外地輕舉妄動。但不知誰能首先發難，出而奮鬥！</p>
<p>南京路房客聯合會，最能代表本市工商界及市民意旨的。為着全上海市民經濟及社會安甯着想，一向關心着這問題的。現在，大家活不落的時候，却還要加重各人的負担。居心何在？實在難以想像的！</p>
<p>全體市民已活不落　盼參議員仗義執言</p>

<h3>球迷如蜂擁而至　乒乓揭幕未賽成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第四屆乒乓聯賽原定昨晚揭幕，假座福建南路金門乒乓球房舉行揭幕賽，由甲級兩强華美對全祿合師。乒乓球迷到者竟達二千餘人，將球房塞滿，比賽無法進行，委員會不得已乃宣告比賽改期。本市乒乓興趣之熱烈，實屬空前。金門乒乓球房義務出借，檯椅損壞，委員會頗表歉意。今晚有乙組六場，分別在各處舉行，秩序如下：</p>
<p>善保—二華（乙一）七時正善保</p>
<p>叔蘋—健新（乙一）七時正精總</p>
<p>永五—陸聯（乙一）八時半精總</p>

<h3>乒乓圈　球人球事</h3>
<p>乒乓名裁判陳季茂，月前突患慢性芒腸炎，進市立第五醫院醫治，經該院醫師悉心割治，着手回春，吉人天相，已告全愈，陳於上屆聯賽中，出力甚多，本屆連任委員，誠熱心份子也。</p>
<p>前「晚霞隊」健將蔣宗迪，蘇州人，七八年曾代表棋佈隊對抗猶太聯軍，創用硬球乒乓比賽，奪得勝利。蔣有綽號「醬蘿蔔」，去年入中國農業機械公司任事，即組織中農乒乓隊加入工界盃競賽，名列分部季軍，全隊人馬，除宗迪外，均係後起新人，有此成績，尚稱不弱。此次報名聯賽乙組奪標，因先有中國農民銀行以中農隊名注冊，為避免雙包案起見，決改名「農機」，蔣則担任隊長一席。</p>
<p>現為全綠隊隊員之范良驥盧永康，二人曾先後效力於金龍與聯星兩隊，堪稱一對志同道合之好友，不久前，二人同日同時假大利酒樓與一對王姓姊妹花結婚，從此范盧二人由朋友變成連襟，可謂艷福不淺！</p>
<p>陳恩榮為華嚴排球隊三排好手，此次陳以農機乙隊長資格，組隊參加本屆聯賽，惟往返辦理一切註冊手續，均由其太太胡家和代辦，家和乃八年前女青乒乓隊五虎將之一，精攻善削，紅極一時，資格較恩榮尤老，目下家和以賢妻良母身份，久已放棄此項運動，如二人者，堪稱一對「福祿鴛鴦」也。</p>
<p>據上屆聯賽乙組冠軍青年隊長錢關欽談：該隊自去冬以來，隊務乏人負責，隊員星散，無形停頓，致難重振旗鼓，繼續加入本屆聯賽，錢本人亦失去參加比賽機會，言下大有不勝惆悵之概！</p>
<h3>九九田徑隊　二次測驗成績</h3>

<h3>運動世界　華聯完成霸業　最後一戰力克恩卡斯　捧得錦標歸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽甲一組昨晚全部完成，最後一場盟主華聯隊以三分險勝恩卡斯，上半時華聯領先十二分之多，二十七比十五，最後結果為四十二比三十九。賽前有插曲一幕，裁判老爺隊勝籃球委員，四十七比四十三。甲一組開賽之前，舉行給獎典禮，華聯隊連獲四屆冠軍，由體育協會幹事邵汝幹授獎，華聯隊隊長任相成接受錦標，典禮於鼓掌聲中完成。體育館內昨晚觀衆狂熱，宣告客滿，統計當有二三千人。</p>
<p>給獎典禮之後，華聯恩卡斯大戰開始，雙方看守嚴密，得分困難，番將先以四比零佔先，華聯跟進成各五之局，於是雙方分數互相上下，難解難分，十分鐘過去為各十一之平手。此後突見劉福善大李等之妙中，華聯漸見抬頭，上半時完畢，恩卡斯落後十二分之多。下半時大李因感不適，因樂嘉洲入替，華聯仍一路佔先，惟雙方距離漸漸縮短，最後十分鐘時，已僅差六分，劉福善五次犯規罰出，張良雄上場，形勢益見危急，時比數為卅九比卅五。迨泊透及却利接連二中，恩卡斯以四十一比三十九僅落後二分。此時距終場尚餘二分半鐘，華聯雖用「麻將」戰術，以求拖延時間，最後十秒鐘時，華聯再中一分，勝負遂成定局，四十二比三十九，華聯再克恩卡斯完成霸業。</p>
<p>昨晚劉福善表演突佳，妙球連中，如有神助，為一大功臣，李震中為全隊中心靈魂，下半時退休，乃造成如此危局，否則決不至此。包松圓亦佳，吳成章則無從發展。恩卡斯昨晚投籃屢擲不中，要亦順與不順也。</p>

<h3>女子籃球術</h3>
<p>— 戚公譯述</p>
<p>（二）死球。</p>
<p>（甲）在不能截刧接球者之球後則要乘他將球接着時，本隊球員應設法趨前不讓他有將球傳出之機會，須要緊持着皮球而成為死球。致死球之後必舉行跳球，雙方都有得球之均等機會。</p>
<p>（乙）球員必須熟練到跳躍够高度，向直跳起，用手指尖將球推高一些而前進而入於預定接球者之手，最好在跳球前先以暗號示意。</p>
<p>（一）前鋒為避免被緊釘着，故在搶奪籃板彈回之球時，必須跳高用指尖將球推到靠近籃底之空檔處在接球者之前落下，俾接球者接球後得立即投籃。</p>
<p>（二）守衛搶籃下球應躍高用指尖將球推到離開籃底之重要區域，最適宜將球推到邊綫處。在死球之後，雙方跳球之時，應留一守衛者位置在籃圈之以前以策安全。</p>
<p>（三）中途截取。</p>
<p>（甲）球員須有預感力，能够迅捷地改變步伐和方向，更須在時間上配合，始能在中途截取對方之傳遞。</p>
<p>（乙）基本技巧熟練則身體靈活受控制，犯規之機會減少。</p>
<p>（丙）球員必須要看清楚是確有截刧之把握才作戰刧之嘗試，或最低限度亦須阻撓對方傳遞出手，使彼傳出偏斜而失去準確性。</p>
<p>（D）施用暗號手勢。</p>
<p>（一）球員在下列之情況下應有施用暗號手勢之必要。</p>
<p>（甲）雙方在中圈跳球時。</p>
<p>（乙）在擲界外球時。</p>
<p>（丙）死球後舉行跳球時。</p>
<p>（丁）採取固定陣式時。</p>
<p>（二）暗號與手勢分類如下。</p>
<p>（甲）口述的暗號，（一）喊出數目，暗號或術語。</p>
<p>（乙）發出手勢俾同隊的球員由於看到手勢而施展動作。</p>
<p>（一）舉手指來示意，（二）搖動手部臂部或足球來示意，（三）中鋒向中圈跑進時之方向而示意。</p>
<p>（三）為節省時間起見，正中鋒在中圈接球發動攻勢之前，當彼進入中圈時就可以同時發出暗號取手勢來向其他兩鋒示意，裁判將球傳擲交中鋒時，其他兩鋒就立即準備去實行預定之計策。</p>
<p>前鋒團體進攻之技巧。</p>
<p>（A）指導各項進攻方式。</p>
<p>（一）施展迅攻法。（甲）對付區域防禦制，企圖引誘守衛者移動離開陣地。（乙）對付人釘人防禦制則須避開守衛者而向籃底竄進。（丙）對付各種防禦方式，必須能够把握着時機，倘遇到守方之陣式在某一個區域無人看管着而有隙可乘時，須立即把握着這個機會而向該區進攻。</p>
<p>（二）施展烟幕術。（甲）利用合法之擋人術來掩護其他進攻者得擺脫看管者而衝進到籃底。（二）藉烟幕之擋人術在對方守衛者之前阻撓着他接球。（三）於中圈發開球而將球傳入對方之場子時可藉烟幕術而發動攻勢。</p>
<p>（甲）當中鋒在中圈準備傳球入對方場子時或他鋒在中綫擲球入場時，就可運用烟幕來掩護。（乙）當中鋒在中圈傳球出手時，其他兩鋒看清楚中鋒所發出之暗號或手勢來進行移動。（丙）務使前鋒勿在中綫呆立等待着接球。（丁）倘若中鋒被守衛者緊釘着，則其他兩鋒應趨前接應本場守衛者傳出之球。（未完D）</p>
<p>一球員躍高急傳，另一球員則將手伸展作假動作。</p>

<h3>關於擴大儲糧</h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>最近，當局又在大呼擴大儲糧了。</p>
<p>根據「有備無患」的古訓，再加上目下米價大跳特跳的經驗，「糧」之應「儲」，已成為每一個市民的常識。而現在這常識早已普遍深入民間，似乎不必在上者的「擴大」宣傳了。</p>
<p>這樣說，並不是對儲糧辦法，有什麼微詞，更不是對擴大運動，有什麼反對，只不過老實地說：因為民以「食」為天，由於幾年來生活的熬煎，任何人已都明白物資和紙幣的價値，而且絕對不會有儲蓄紙幣的白痴。所以萬一「儲」的表現不够，只是「力」的問題了。</p>
<p>記得不久以前，當局也曾提醒過我們；：每戶應作三個月存糧的凖備。這警吿，是絕對善的意，也是吿訴市民應該「有備無患」，正如這次擴大儲糧是絕對善意的一樣。然而結果呢，不敢說。因為在五百多萬市民當中，能一口氣準備好三個月的存糧的，恐怕只佔極小數中的極小數，得益的自然很少。反之，一般有產階級，給這一提便更提高了警覺性，認為米是有問題了，於是乎便大儲特儲。甚焉者更把目光轉移到別種日用品，也一樣地大囤特國。一爭購，當局所指出應儲的糧，以及並未指出的應儲的其他日用品，便也乘機大漲特漲，因而升斗小民，本來可儲糧三天的，這一來，便打了個對折，甚至連一天的糧，也儲不起來了。</p>
<p>以今天的社會經濟狀况言，大多數的市民，早已淪入升斗階級了。做一天工作，買一天的糧食，是一般勞力階級的生活情形；做一個月的工作，到月底薪水到手，能買到下個月多少天的糧還是一個謎，這是一般薪水階級的生活情形。</p>
<p>在這種事實下，多數市民是有心無力，則這次擴大儲糧的效果如何，自然母待龜卜的了。</p>
<p>迄至寫完這篇東西時，米價據說已超過三十萬大關，希望明天不致因為有擴大儲糧的提倡，而再創什麼記錄。如果儲糧的利益，在彼而不在此，則沒有「儲」的力量的升斗小民，眞將無噍類矣。</p>
<h3>姓氏拆字考</h3>

<h3>觀劇外記</h3>
<p>— 談客</p>
<p>三月廿九日，休假。這是多麼難得的星期日以外的休假！蘭心正在上演三幕喜劇「以身作則」，積悶已多且久的胸懷，理宜鬆解一下，於是約伴往觀「以身作則」。</p>
<p>為了省一筆車資，步行又嫌太費時，決定騎脚踏車去。車子雖不太「挺括」，可是在柏汕路上滑走，倒也穩而且速。不上十分鐘蘭心已在望。到了蘭心，急急去買票，前座已無空位，只得買了後座的票子，好在蘭心塲子並不大，後座也相當好，而且還是花樓座呢！</p>
<p>票子買好，就想到車子的安放問題。同去的S提議寄存在「位朋友家裏。可是朋友家距離蘭心有相當長的一段路，現在騎去固易易，等會兒散塲出來須步行去拿車子，大家覺得有一點兒沒勁。於是回過車頭，重復在蘭心前停了下來，想就近鎖在人行道畔的樹上或電桿上。我以為就交給那在蘭心前的「車子的標局」，出幾個錢也無妨。無異議通過了，S鎖車子，我問價錢。來一接洽」的有兩個人，一個是中年男子，三四十歲，短裝；一個是四五十歲的婦人，穿旗袍。</p>
<p>却說探問價錢後的回答是乾脆的一句話：</p>
<p>「四百元一部！一——是謂討價。</p>
<p>「二百元行不行呢？」——此則是還價了。</p>
<p>「三百元，照昨天的價錢，再不能推扳了！」——這當然是讓步。</p>
<p>然而S顯得不耐煩了：</p>
<p>「校裏寄放車子，一個月也祇一千塊錢，鎖到別處去吧！」一面將已經上鎖的車子，重又打開鏈子。</p>
<p>鎖好車子，時間已迫，走趕忙進塲入座。我很不放心，但無可奈何：車子會不會被藏過或弄掉些零件呢？——不會吧，這當是過慮。</p>
<p>台上的戲吿一段落，S離座，說去看一看車子，原來他也有些不放心。S回來的報吿是：</p>
<p>「從窗口望下去，車子靜靜的倚在樹身上，安然無恙。」於是皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>四時三刻，戲散塲。車子仍靜靜的倚在樹身上，只是上面的鈴給摘了，後胎給放了氣。</p>
<p>至於那「車子的標局」呢？無從去尋找了，也無須尋找了。</p>

<h3>The Government Will Issue a Statement on the Current Situation / Representatives of the Peace Talks Meet with Mao Zedong / Detailed Discussions Approach Core Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] According to reliable sources, the government will issue a statement on the current situation in the near future. The statement is currently being drafted by the Executive Yuan and will be finalized soon.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Acting President Li continued to receive phone calls from Peiping on the 11th, reiterating that the Chinese Communists had issued an order on the 10th to cease military offensives with immediate effect. At the same time, it was reported that the delegation in Peiping had made contact with the representatives of the Chinese Communists: Chief Delegate Zhang Zhizhong had a four-hour long conversation with Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM on the 8th. Zhang Shizhao and Shao Lizi met with Mao Zedong on the 9th, also holding lengthy talks for several hours. On the 10th, all the delegates met with Mao Zedong. Although formal peace talks have not yet begun, the exchange of opinions on various issues is very close, and the eight conditions are no longer insisted upon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] It is reliably learned that Chief Delegate of the Peace Talks Delegation, Zhang Zhizhong, had a four-hour long conversation with Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong on the 8th. Representatives Zhang Shizhao and Shao Lizi met with Mao Zedong on the 9th and had very detailed discussions on various issues, gradually approaching the core issues.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] During the peace talks, the "Third Force" has been making great efforts in both Peiping and Nanking. In addition to sending representatives to Nanking to express their opinions, they are also acting as intermediaries in Peiping. The Chinese Communist order to cease military offensives is a result of the efforts of the "Third Force". The person who notified Acting President Li of this via telephone from Peiping at 10:00 PM on the 10th was also a member of the "Third Force".</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] After the Chinese Communists ordered a cessation of military offensives, according to news received on the 11th, although there were still some engagements on the front lines, the trend towards a cessation seems to be growing. However, this is only the Chinese Communists ceasing their offensives. The National Army has not taken offensive action for a long time, so there is no need for the government to consider issuing a similar order. On the 11th, it was rumored that the Ministry of National Defense had also issued a ceasefire order, but after inquiring with Chief of the General Staff Gu Zhutong, it was confirmed to be untrue.</p>
<h3>Senior Government Officials to Go to Peiping / Chinese Communists Express Welcome / Yu Youren Largely Agrees to Go North</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] The Chinese Communists have expressed their welcome to the government's senior officials going to Peiping. It is reported that in a phone call from people of the "Third Force" to the Acting President, it was explained that the Chinese Communists "welcome several old gentlemen to come to Peiping for a look."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Yu Youren, Zhang Qun, Wu Zhongxin and other four senior officials will accept the invitation of Acting President Li and go to Peiping within three to five days to assist in the progress of the peace talks. Acting President Li personally went to great lengths for this matter. He went to Yu Youren's residence at 6:00 PM on the 11th to explain that he had received a long-distance phone call from the "Third Force" in Peiping on the evening of the 10th, urging Yu and others to go to Peiping as soon as possible. The Acting President said in the phone call that with the war on the Yangtze River line approaching, Yu Youren would not be able to come. The person replied that the Chinese Communists had agreed to order a cessation of military offensives. The Acting President also promised to invite Yu Youren to set out immediately. Before explaining this matter, the Acting President specifically told him that the Chinese Communists had ordered a cessation of military offensives. On the 11th, many Legislative and Supervisory Committee members visited Yu Youren throughout the day, most of them urging him to go to Peiping. When Yu Youren met with reporters at 8:00 PM, he said: "Except for a small reservation, I have agreed."</p>

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Dong Lin and Legislative Committee member Chen Bosheng arrived with him. Executive Yuan Premier He Yingqin, Secretary-General Huang ShaoGu, and Minister of Communications Duanmu Jie all went to the airport to welcome him.

<h3>Bai Chongxi Enjoys Sightseeing / Boated on Xuanwu Lake Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Bai Chongxi has been in high spirits for sightseeing in recent days. He visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum on the 10th, and boated on Xuanwu Lake on the afternoon of the 11th. Those who accompanied him included Huang Qihan and Liu Zhongrong from Peiping.

<h3>Liu Ziheng Returns to Nanjing</h3>

<h3>The Chongqing Warship's Defection is Due to Negligence / Gui Yongqing is Removed from Office but Retained / The President Issues an Order of Admonishment and Observation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency (North Branch), Nanjing, 11th] President's order of April 11th: It is found that in the case of the defection of the Chongqing warship on February 25th of this year, Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing was negligent in prevention beforehand, and the personnel management of the warship was also inadequate, which is indeed due to negligence. However, considering that the Commander-in-Chief has held military positions for a long time and has always been known for his merits, and that the defection of the warship occurred during a patrol, and prevention was not possible, lenient treatment should be given. He is hereby removed from office but retained, to show admonishment and observe future performance. This is the order.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Supervisory Committee members Cao Dexuan and Lu Fengge investigated the Chongqing warship defection case and have filed an impeachment against Gui Yongqing, which has been reviewed and established. The reason for the impeachment is that Gui should be held responsible for the defection of the Chongqing warship. The impeachment states that Gui used the navy to engage in factional struggles as a means of control. Old cadres of the Qingdao faction were squeezed out, and recently, young members of the Qingdao faction were used to exclude the Mawei faction. Factional friction formed a long-term cause of the Chongqing warship defection. The dismissal of Deng Zhaoxiang and the replacement with the young and inexperienced Lu Dongge, Deng's request to become a member of the Legal System Committee was denied, only to be appointed as the deputy director of the First Department, and forced him to stay on the ship for two months for handover, which was the immediate cause of the Chongqing warship defection.</p>
<h3>Fang Dong and Shen Xirui Firmly Decline New Positions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Newly appointed Vice Minister of Finance Fang Dong and Deputy Governor of the Central Bank Shen Xirui have firmly declined their new positions. Minister of Finance and Governor Liu believes that the two positions cannot be vacant for long and is considering successors. In addition, the resignation of Xie Gengmin, Director of the National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance, has been approved. The Ministry of Personnel has announced that Chen Qingyu, Manager of the Nanjing Central Bank, will succeed him. The Manager of the Nanjing Central Bank will be succeeded by Wang Zhong, as announced by the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Director of the Executive Yuan Information Office to be Concurrently Held by Bao Jingan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Executive Yuan issued an order on the 11th, appointing Bao Jingan, a counselor of the Yuan, to concurrently serve as the Director of the Executive Yuan Information Office.</p>
<h3>The Situation on the Zhenjiang Front Turns to Ease / Communist Troops North of the Yangtze Retreat Slightly / Small Group of Communist Troops Crosses the Yangtze River to the Southwest of Yangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Office, 11th] The situation on the Zhenjiang front has eased. No artillery fire has been heard from the bridgehead positions north of the Yangtze River in the past 24 hours. All the first-line troops of the Communist army have retreated north by about five to eight li, which is obviously the impact of the ceasefire order. The Communist troops attacking Liuwei have retreated from Laosiwei, Zhujia flagpole, to the line of Tangjiaqiao, Majiawan, and Shijiaqiao to reorganize. The Communist troops north of Guazhou have retreated from Houhuayuan and Balipu to Huayuanzhuang. The majority of the 26th Army of the 8th Corps of the Communist troops attacking Shierwei from three sides have retreated to the Liuzhuang and Chenzhuang area north of Xincheng. Xincheng has now become a vacuum zone. The National Army has not pursued the retreating Communist troops. In addition, the Ding Zuobin unit of the National Army stationed in Liuwei has been ordered to return to the south of the Yangtze River to reorganize and replenish, and another army will take over the defense of Liuwei. The Longwokou area is still firmly defended by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Office, 11th] Lin Zun, commander of the Second Fleet of the Navy stationed in Zhenjiang, telegraphed the headquarters of the Navy on the 11th, requesting the allocation of warships and gunboats to Zhenjiang to assist the National Army in defending the bridgeheads north of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Office, 11th] A part of the Communist troops in Sanjiangying, in coordination with local Communist bandits, attacked Daqiao Town (at the junction of Zhenjiang and Yangzhou) in the first district of Zhenjiang County on the night of the 7th. After the local militia calmly responded, the Communist troops reinforced the attack with four more regiments on the night of the 10th. Due to the disparity in numbers, the local militia has taken the initiative to retreat to Dagang.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] According to the Military News Agency: (1) An air force reconnaissance report stated that dozens of wooden boats carrying a small group of Communist troops crossed the Yangtze River from Sanjiangying in the afternoon of the 11th and occupied the vicinity of the 24th and 79th Weirs in the southwest and northwest of Yangzhou. The National Army has dispatched troops to suppress them. (2) The fighting at Huazikou eased in the afternoon of the 10th. On the 11th, the National Army counterattacked eastward, killing and wounding more than 100 Communist troops. The situation in the area is stable. (3) The Communist troops attacking Guazhou, Liuwei, and Ershierwei across the Yangtze River from Zhenjiang retreated slightly to the north in the afternoon of the 10th, leaving a part to fight against the National Army.</p>
<h3>Ma Hongkui and His Wife Arrive in Nanjing / Says He Does Not Understand the Peiping-Style Peace / Speaks of the People's Livelihood During the Conversation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Ningxia Chairman Ma Hongkui, in response to the telegram from Acting President Li, arrived in Nanjing by special plane from Ningxia at 1:30 PM on the 11th with his wife, Ms. Liu Muxia. Acting President Li sent representative Liu Shiyi to welcome them. After getting off the plane, Ma went to No. 2 Ninghai Road to rest and met with Legislative and Supervisory Committee members from Ningxia. In the evening at 6:00 PM, Chief Bai Chongxi visited and had a long conversation for about an hour before leaving after dinner at 8:00 PM. According to Ma's statement to our reporter, peace is what the people of the whole country yearn for. Turning hostility into friendship and saving the people from fire and water is necessary today. If peace can succeed, it is what everyone hopes for. When the reporter asked his opinion on Fu Zuoyi's Peiping-style peace, Ma avoided answering, saying that he did not understand the situation in Peiping, but asked in a rhetorical tone: "Mr. Fu and I are very good friends. We are both soldiers, and military affairs are our profession, but we always inevitably do a poor job in politics. This time, Mr. Fu probably had some shortcomings in his advance planning, right?" When the reporter mentioned Fu Zuoyi's telegram on April 1, Ma asked in a doubtful tone: "Is it true?" Later, Ma also said that we have very good Three Principles of the People, but unfortunately we have not been able to implement them. If we could implement them, we would not need the Communist Party to liberate us. The weather is getting warmer, and we will take off our leather pants. Why don't we liberate ourselves?" During the conversation, Ma was quite concerned about the people's livelihood. He said that it is no longer the era of feudal warlords, and everything should be for the sake of the people's lives. This time he came to Nanjing, he plans to stay for a few days, in addition to visiting Acting President Li, he also plans to treat his illness.</p>
<p>Ma is scheduled to visit Acting President Li at 9:00 AM on the 12th and Premier He at 11:00 AM. Acting President Li will host a banquet for Ma at 7:00 PM on the evening of the 12th.</p>
<h3>Yizheng County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren Escorted to Yangzhou After Being Captured</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Office, 11th] It is learned that after County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren was captured in the Yizheng battle, the Communist army escorted him to the Yangzhou Military Control Commission on the 10th.</p>
<h3>The Zhenjiang North Gate Airport to be Completed by a Deadline</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Office, 12th] The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction has ordered the Zhenjiang County Government to complete the construction of the Zhenjiang Northeast Gate Airport by April 15.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Garrison Commander Speaks of Comprehensive Arrangements on the Periphery</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 10th] (Delayed) Wuhan Garrison Commander Lu Daoyuan met with our reporter today and said that although the outer defense line of Wuhan is becoming increasingly tight, we have comprehensive arrangements. The city defense works here are also very solid. It is not easy for the Communist army to launch an offensive against Hankou in the lake and swamp area. Moreover, strategically, the importance of the bridgeheads on the east and west sides is greater than that of Hankou. Although the pressure from the Communist army has increased, peace talks have not been abandoned. The safety of Wuhan in the short term should be guaranteed. Citizens do not need to panic each other, and those who have the ability to evacuate automatically can be allowed to do so freely, and there is no need to restrict or interfere at this time.</p>
<h3>The Battle in Eastern Hubei Approaches the Riverbank / The National Army Completes Deployment Between Xiaogan and Huangpi / The Communist Offensive Against Wuhu Across the River Has Been Thwarted</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 11th] Military news: After the Communist troops deployed troops in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, they controlled some strongholds on the west side of the railway south of Anlu to Yummeng, controlling the back of Xiaogan; on the other hand, they crossed the important sites of Hekouzhen and Songbu on the east side of the railway to peep into Huangpi and threaten the right wing of Wuhan. The National Army on the front has adapted to this situation. There has been no major change in the online situation for ten days, and the Communist army's actions seem to be waiting for something. However, in eastern Hubei, after the Communist troops successively captured Xishui and Huangmei, the battle has approached the Jiangbei bridgehead. In order to strengthen the river defense, the Navy has deployed several ships to increase the defense of Wuxue and Tianjiazhen, from 蕲水 to the Guanxi Town river surface. At the same time, the local Communist bandits in central and western Hubei also have a southward movement, and the development in the next few days is very noteworthy.</p>
<p>[Our Huangpi Office, 10th] (Delayed) A certain strong army corps guarding the three towns of Wuhan has used the complex terrain outside Hankou, relying on strong fortifications, to complete a new deployment. The front line on the east side of the Pinghan Railway in Huangpi, the front of Pinghan in Sanjiaobu, and the west bank of the Fuhe River in the area bordering Xiaogan, Yingcheng, and Hanchuan have completed the northern, eastern, and western front lines of Hankou.</p>
<p>[Our Xiaogan Office, 10th] (Delayed) (1) The military confirmed that the National Army abandoned Yunmeng County, 70 miles away from Xiaogan on all four sides of Pinghan yesterday. The National Army in Yingcheng is still holding the Daorenqiao on the west bank of the Fuhe River, confronting the Communist troops who invaded Changjiangbu across the river. (2) More than 10,000 Communist troops moving south from Huayuan in the Pinghan area arrived north of Xiaojiagang, and some have sneaked to the east side of the railway and joined the 43rd Army of Lin Biao's troops moving south along the Luo (Shan) Huang (Pi) Highway west of Zhangxuanling. The Communist troops tried to harass the territory of Huangpi County last night and arrived near Wangjiapeng, 30 miles northwest of Huangpi this morning. (3) More than 3,000 Communist troops who had sneaked to Putan, south of Xiaogan Ding, that night opened to the area west of Sanjiaobu, seemingly attempting to destroy the railway between Xiaogan and Hengdian. Seeing the armored train approaching, they immediately fled north. (4) More than 20,000 Communist troops approaching Songbu from Baoguan Station and Baiguo southwest of Macheng arrived at Liuzigang southwest of Songbu yesterday. Some of the National Army in Songbu have moved to Xinzhou (about 50 kilometers from Hankou), and are working with the National Army retreating from the area between Macheng and Huangpi to block the Communist troops invading from the south. (5) The 38th Division of the 13th Army of the Communist troops who sneaked into Xishui in eastern Hubei continued to attack Suxizhen, the bridgehead on the riverbank in eastern Hubei, yesterday, and are engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army. In addition, the Communist troops of Chen Geng's Corps 15th Army, which sneaked into Huangmei County from Yingshan and Taihu, continued to move westward yesterday, isolating Guang'an on the edge of Bieshan, and the situation is tense. (6) After Lin Biao's troops occupied Huayuan, they are actively conscripting civilians to repair the Xiang (Yang) Hua (Yuan) Highway, and plan to widen the road surface. The road passes west through Anlu, Suixian, and Zhaoyang, and can reach Xiangyang from Anlu via Yunmeng, Yingcheng, Jingshan, and Zhongxiang and to Jingmen.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Military News Agency: The Communist offensive in the Liangshan, Yuxikou, and Erba areas across the river from Wuhu has been slightly thwarted on the morning of the 11th.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 11th] Military News: (1) More than 600 Communist troops outside Anqing launched a sneak attack on the Agricultural and Forestry School and Qingfengling on the evening of the 10th, but failed because our army's curfew was extremely strict. (2) Communist troops in Huangmei attacked Zhuogang at dusk on the 10th, and retreated after being counterattacked by the defending army. (3) More than 1,000 Communist troops in Xishui attacked Liushengang on the 10th. After an hour of fierce fighting due to the disparity in numbers, the defending army withdrew. (4) Lin Biao's 40th Army occupied Anlu on the 10th, and part of the 43rd Army, 2,000 troops, sneaked into Hengshan, north of Huangpo, on the 10th.</p>

(1) The Finance and Economics Committee examined the proposal to organize gold-priced deposits and improve the method of salary payment in the morning, and decided on three principles for handling: 1. Gold-priced deposits: Please ask the government to properly draft the measures and implement them as soon as possible; 2. Improving the treatment of public school teachers: The Legislative Yuan has a special discussion on this matter, and this proposal will be postponed; 3. The establishment of a deposit fund management committee is related to the banking system and will be transferred to the Central Bank Organization Law Amendment Review and merged for discussion. (2) The Economic Data Committee, the Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committee, and the Legal System Committee jointly reviewed the Organization Law of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the morning and decided not to establish a Fisheries Department, but to add a fisheries and animal husbandry item to the business of the Agriculture and Forestry Department. The Resources Committee was renamed the Resources Bureau, and the Agriculture and Forestry Department and the Water Conservancy Department maintained the original plan.

(5) The convening members of the Legal System Committee held a meeting and decided to appoint special personnel to be responsible for reviewing the proposal to stop applying the Provisional Clauses, the proposal to amend the Organization Law of the Judicial Yuan, and the proposal to amend the Organization Law of the Examination Yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 11th] Legislators Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian were suddenly arrested at the Wenfeng Bookstore around 2 p.m. on the 10th and taken to the Garrison Headquarters. Xu Wentian was immediately sent to Shanghai, while Jin Shaoxian was released at 11:30 p.m. on the 10th. The case was handled directly by personnel dispatched from Shanghai. Those arrested before and after included Peng Juntao, manager of Wenfeng Bookstore, as well as several staff and workers. By midnight on the 10th, all those arrested except Xu Wentian and two others had been released on bail.</p>
<p>[Our Beijing Dispatch of the 11th] After receiving reports of the arrest of legislators Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian on the morning of the 11th, President He Yingqin discussed the matter at length with President Tong Guanxian and Secretary-General Chen Kewen of the Legislative Yuan. He then summoned Zhang Yaoming to inquire about the details of the arrest. He separately telegraphed Tang Enbo and Zhang Yaoming, ordering them to immediately escort Xu Wentian, who had been taken to Shanghai, back to Beijing, and to escort the personnel handling the case to Beijing for questioning.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 11th] The details of the arrest of legislator Xu Wentian are quite complex. Relevant authorities have refused to explain the reasons, but it is rumored to be related to the Farmers' and Workers' News Agency. The agency's address is upstairs from the Wenfeng Bookstore where Xu and others were arrested.</p>
<p>Jin Shaoxian Recounts His Experience From Arrest to Release</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 11th] Legislator Jin Shaoxian described to our reporter in detail on the afternoon of the 11th his experience of being arrested and released on the 10th, as follows: Around 12 p.m. on the 10th, Jin was returning from visiting a friend and met Xu Wentian near Hankou Road. They immediately took a rickshaw back to the Central Hotel. After passing Daxing Palace, Xu said he intended to visit legislator Chen Xiaosen at Wenfeng Bookstore. Jin, thinking it was not far from the Central Hotel, got out of the rickshaw at the same time and followed Xu into Wenfeng Bookstore to browse the displayed books while waiting. He saw someone ask Xu when he went upstairs, "Who are you looking for?" Xu said, "Committee member Chen." However, Xu seemed to sense that the person asking the question looked different and hesitated slightly, intending to go back. The questioner suddenly changed his demeanor and did not allow Xu to leave. Xu showed his legislator attendance card, saying he was a legislator. They said, "We are acting on orders," and then two or three people took Xu away. At the same time, someone questioned Jin. Jin thought it had nothing to do with him, but the questioner asked Jin to come upstairs. It was about 3 p.m. when Jin went upstairs. He saw several officers and soldiers inside. Because he had an appointment, he wanted to make a phone call, but was not allowed. Jin stayed upstairs for about a quarter of an hour before being escorted to the guard unit of the Garrison Headquarters by two plainclothes officers. There were already more than ten men and women being held there, including Xu Wentian, who was in handcuffs. They were speechless to each other. Then Chief Staff Officer Chen came to talk, saying that he was acting on orders and that the important one was Xu Wentian. As for what to do with Jin Shaoxian, he had to ask Shanghai for instructions. Jin interceded for Xu, saying that he was just a scholar, so why put him in handcuffs? Could they please remove them? Chen refused. Jin then asked to call Zhang Yaoming. Chen replied that Zhang had no jurisdiction and that the matter was being handled on orders from Shanghai. Jin said that according to the Constitution, legislators could not be arbitrarily arrested and that it would be best to let the superiors know. Chen said, "I know," but still did not consider the phone call to Zhang. Chen then called Shanghai to ask for instructions, but the person in charge was not there. Chen took Xu Wentian and two others away. Before leaving, he handed Jin over to the guard unit leader of the Garrison Headquarters to watch. At this time, the situation seemed to have eased, and the guard was more relaxed. Jin took the opportunity to talk to those who had been arrested together and learned that the Wenfeng Bookstore had been under surveillance for two or three days. Those arrested included the manager, staff, and workers of Wenfeng Bookstore, who had all been interrogated severely. At that time, people were successively released on bail, and there were still two people who were providing bail. The guards said, "Don't worry, you will definitely be released today." Waiting until about 11 p.m., it seemed that they had received a call from Shanghai, approving Jin's release. The guards said that others had to provide bail, but Jin was a legislator and did not need to provide bail, but asked Jin to keep the matter a secret after going out and not to tell others about what happened. Jin refused, preferring to continue to be held. They considered it for a long time, and finally released Jin at 11:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Acting President Li Sends Personnel to Express Condolences</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 11th] Legislator Jin Shaoxian, who was arrested on the 10th and released the same day, visited Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian and Executive Yuan President He Yingqin on the morning of the 11th to explain what happened, and telephoned Acting President Li. Acting President Li sent legislator Qiu Changwei to Jin's residence at 4:30 p.m. to inquire about what happened and express his condolences. President Tong said that he hoped President He could attend the Legislative Yuan meeting to explain the matter. When Jin met He Yingqin, He said that he knew nothing about it beforehand and had asked Garrison Commander Zhang Yaoming, who also said he did not know. Jin made three requests to He: (1) Xu Wentian's health is weak, and he hopes to be released quickly; (2) the safety of legislators is threatened, and he hopes to take effective measures to protect them; (3) whether his personal safety will be a problem, and he hopes to be protected. He replied: Xu Wentian has been ordered to be escorted back to Beijing quickly, the safety of legislators will be protected as much as possible, and he believes that Jin's personal safety will not be a problem, but he still agreed to study concrete measures.</p>
<p>Xu and Jin's Arrest to Be Discussed at Legislative Yuan Today</p>
<p>President He Invited to Attend and Report</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 11th] Legislators were extremely agitated upon learning of the arrest of Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian on the 10th, considering it a "violation of the Constitution," because Article 34 of the Constitution stipulates that "Legislators shall not be arrested or detained without the permission of the Legislative Yuan, except in cases of flagrante delicto." Xu and Jin were arrested while visiting friends, which does not constitute "flagrante delicto," and the Legislative Yuan had not received any notification before the arrest. Around 9 a.m. on the 11th, dozens of legislators went to the Legislative Yuan to visit President Tong Guanxian, asking him to immediately find a way to rescue them and correct this unconstitutional situation. It was decided to bring it up for discussion at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 12th, and to invite Executive Yuan President He Yingqin to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting that day to report on the arrest. At the same time, Tong Guanxian was pushed to visit He Yingqin immediately to negotiate the release of Xu Wentian.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Develop the City's Industry and Commerce!</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government held an industry and commerce symposium on the morning of the 10th to analyze the current economic situation and explore a smooth path for the development of the city's industry and commerce in a difficult environment. The participants in the symposium were all leaders of the city's industry and commerce, who spoke out one after another and put forward good opinions on the rights and wrongs of the current economic phenomena. They saw the current economic crisis lurking everywhere, such as: (1) The recent daily and nightly price increases, with prices rising several times in one day; (2) Interest rates so high that they were frightening, stifling legitimate industry and commerce; (3) Lack of raw material sources, making it almost impossible to reproduce after selling finished products; (4) The dwindling reserves of food, fuel, and other daily necessities, threatening the lives of citizens; (5) Stagnant sales of finished products, with a depression occurring despite high prices. Therefore, they unanimously believed that if the city's industry and commerce were to be developed, it was necessary to immediately implement the exchange of materials between the North and the South. Therefore, it was decided that more than a dozen units of relevant industry and commerce agencies would organize a North-South Material Exchange Design Committee to seek the early realization of North-South material exchange.</p>
<p>Since the opening of price limits in November last year, prices have risen all the way, almost without end; but the depression of industry and commerce has always existed. This deformed phenomenon is almost impossible to explain with economic theory. In theory, economic prosperity is a natural phenomenon during periods of high prices, and economic depression only occurs when there is overproduction and prices fall. In the era of the old legal tender, the faster the inflation, the higher the prices rose, and under the principle of "a rising tide lifts all boats," general industry and commerce also showed a prosperous scene, although it was a superficial prosperity, it could still barely be maintained. But now, on the one hand, high prices make consumers feel threatened in their lives; on the other hand, economic depression makes general industry and commerce feel the pain of wanting to die but not being able to live.</p>
<p>There are certainly many reasons for this deformed phenomenon; but the most important reasons are, first, the cost of production is too high, and most of the raw materials come from abroad, because the price of foreign exchange certificates has risen sharply, exceeding the multiple of price increases; after the finished products are sold, the raw materials cannot be replenished, and reproduction is impossible. Even in terms of domestic raw materials, the speed of raw material price increases is often above that of finished products due to the continuation of the war and the difficulty of transportation. Second, the oppression of usury makes industry and commerce unable to bear the burden of interest, and the cheap sale of income cannot be reproduced, so there is only the way of tightening and stopping work.</p>
<p>The continued existence of this phenomenon will not only make industrialists and businessmen have no way out, but also affect the general salaried class who depend on the "cost of living index" to make a living. The disconnect between the "cost of living index" and prices is already a fact that no one can deny, and the complaints of the salaried class about the inaccuracy of the cost of living index are already a common conclusion everywhere. But from the manufacturers' point of view, the index is still too high and cannot be afforded, and sometimes even the salaries cannot be paid, which leads to disputes between labor and capital. Therefore, we do not need to talk high-sounding words about what affects the national economy and the people's livelihood; just for the sake of stabilizing the lives of the people of Shanghai, this deformed economic phenomenon cannot be allowed to continue for a long time.</p>
<p>There are certainly many ways to save the current economic crisis; but the easiest way to achieve results seems to be the exchange of materials between the North and the South. Everyone knows that China's economy is a whole organic body and cannot be divided; now, due to the civil war, the North and the South are isolated and materials cannot be exchanged, just like the blood in the human body cannot circulate; both the North and the South feel the pain of partial exhaustion. In other words, the city's industry and commerce certainly need the North's fuel and raw materials; and the North also needs the city's finished products. If materials between the North and the South can be exchanged, both sides will benefit from it; otherwise, both sides will feel the pain of partial exhaustion, the lives of the people in the North will certainly not be improved, and the city's industry and commerce cannot move from depression to prosperity. From this, it can be seen even more that peace is important for the economy, and if the peace talks in Beiping are unfortunately unsuccessful, then all major plans related to the national economy and the people's livelihood will not be discussed. Relying solely on the exchange of materials between the North and the South will not immediately get the city's industry and commerce out of the predicament. How to develop the city's industry and commerce should still start from the root.</p>
<h3>Tao Xisheng Analyzes the Situation in Guangzhou: This Week Is Key for Peace Talks; If the CCP Crosses the Yangtze, China Will Face Atomic Bomb Warfare; President Chiang Supports Comprehensive Peace and Will Not Go to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th] The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week on the 11th. Chairman Li Zonghuang led the ceremony. Then, Vice Minister Tao Xisheng of the Central Propaganda Department analyzed the current situation. Tao first said: This week is the key to the peace talks. Whether an agreement can be reached on the principles of the peace talks will be a matter within this week. The current peace talks are of great importance. The survival of the nation, the lives of the people, and the safety of the world all depend on its success or failure. If the peace talks can achieve comprehensive and just peace, then China will not perish, the people can rest, the crisis of World War III in the Far East can be缓和ed, and China will not become a battlefield. If the CCP forces the government to surrender, or crosses the Yangtze militarily, then China's national survival, the people's free way of life, and the security of the Far East will all be threatened and destroyed. World War III will inevitably arrive earlier. After eight years of war against Japan and three years of turmoil, China will face the flames of an atomic bomb war, and its tragedy will be unprecedented in history. Tao continued, saying that the democratic countries' line of defense against aggression is being formed. The CCP has issued a declaration that it will help Soviet Russia fight in World War III. The CCP's attempt to create a battlefield in China promotes the early realization of the anti-communist united front of democratic countries in the Pacific and various ethnic groups in Asia. If the CCP breaks the peace talks, or advances to cross the Yangtze River to force the government to surrender, then China's 12 million square miles of territory and 400 million people, wherever they raise the flag of the Republic of China against aggression, will immediately receive the support of the democratic world. However, the party's policy today is to support Acting President Li and President He in striving for comprehensive and just peace and to hope for its success. As President Chiang said to foreign reporters at the end of October last year: "China has no intention of solving China's internal problems by taking advantage of the common disaster of the world." It must be known that if World War III occurs, China will inevitably be a major battlefield, and even if the China problem is solved in the world problem, the pain and sacrifice of the Chinese people will be unbearable. Based on this reason, President Chiang reiterated the peace policy in his New Year's Day message. The party still adheres to this policy today, and the government's sincere efforts to seek peace aim to prevent the CCP from guiding China to fight for Soviet Russia. Finally, Tao explained President Chiang's attitude, saying that General Chiang, in his position as an ordinary citizen, supports the government in striving for comprehensive peace and hopes for its success. The General will not come to Guangzhou. It is rumored that the party will convene the Fifth Plenary Session and the General will come to Guangzhou to preside over it, which is completely untrue. The General is the leader of the party, but the major plans for war and peace are all decided by Acting President Li and President He.</p>

He said that he had been co-governing the border with the late Commander Deng Xiugong for nearly 30 years, and his consistent plan was to severely punish the stubborn and support the good border people, allowing them to change to Han nationality and join the militia. Those who had been exiled as wild Yi people would never be recalled to their homeland. After Deng's death, the situation in Ningyuan became complex, and the wild Yi people in various places were stirring up trouble, taking the opportunity to plot rebellion. He decided to follow Deng's past policies, protect his homeland, stabilize the local area, and make harmony between the Han and Yi people his goal. In addition, the Ningyuan Garrison Committee requested that the counties of Huili, Yanbian, and Ningnan, which are located in the key area of Kangdian, thoroughly organize and train the people within two months.</p>
<h3>Dozens of Businesses Close in Chengdu Due to Fierce Inflation; Many Speculators Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch of the 11th] After four days of runaway inflation in Chengdu, prices gradually stabilized on the 11th.

<h3>Long Yun Has No Intention of Returning to Politics; Extremely Concerned About Banditry in Yunnan; Wan Baobang's Bandit Gang in Southern Yunnan Has Been Decimated</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch of the 11th] This reporter visited Provincial Committee Member Yang Wenqing, who had just returned from Hong Kong, again on the morning of the 11th, focusing especially on the movements of former Chairman Long Yun. According to reports, Long Yun has been away from Yunnan for four years and feels very estranged from everything in his hometown, but he is very concerned about banditry in Yunnan. President He had previously sent Long's eldest son to Hong Kong to ask him to come out of retirement, but Long declined due to illness. His interest in politics has almost completely disappeared, and the current situation is chaotic, so Long has no intention of re-entering the vortex. Yang finally said that he had separately visited Acting President Li, President He, and Chief of Staff Gu in Beijing, and they all expressed great concern for Yunnan's politics. However, they expressed absolute faith in Chairman Lu and decided to give Chairman Lu the greatest power to deal with the difficulties. As long as it is beneficial to the people of Yunnan Province, he can take decisive actions, and the central government will not interfere.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 11th] Former Yunnan Chairman Long Yun sent a letter to the Nanjing authorities this morning, refusing to serve as Yunnan Chairman again. In the letter, he insisted that Acting President Li should accept Mao Zedong's eight conditions proposed as the basis for peace talks. The Nationalist government had invited Long Yun to serve as Yunnan Chairman again.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 11th] Long Yun issued a statement today, advocating that Acting President Li accept Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions. According to reports, the power to put the country on the path of peace rests with Li, and surrender is not shameful. If the Nationalist government seeks to obtain a final base in Yunnan, I will unite the people to overthrow this reactionary force.</p>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch of the 11th] Since the Nationalist army recovered Pingbian in southern Yunnan, Wan Baobang, whose old nest was lost, led more than 300 of his trusted bandits to flee from Pingdong Lahadi to Bajiaozhai. The 26th Army continued to pursue and suppress them, killing Yang Weixin, the captain of the 6th Detachment of Wan's gang. Zhang Shucheng, the pseudo-camp chief, led his troops to surrender. The main force suffered a major setback. The Nationalist army took advantage of the victory to strengthen its pressure. The bandits fled into the mountains and finally captured He Chengwu, the pseudo-deputy commander-in-chief of Wan's gang, alive. Wan Baobang fled along a small road to the watershed. His army has been decimated, and the Nationalist army is still advancing.</p>

<h3>Relief Funds Distributed on the Pinghan Railway; Employees' Attitudes Ease</h3>
<p>[Our Yingkou Dispatch of the 11th] Due to the impact of the war, the Pinghan Railway's northbound passenger trains only run to Xiaogan. More than 5,000 employees from stations south of Xinyang have been evacuated to Hankou one after another. These employees felt that their lives and residences were seriously threatened, and they had collectively requested relief from the railway bureau and the Central China Commander's Office for days, and sent personnel to protect the road stations that could still be used. For a time, the crowd was excited, and there were repeated fights with the bureau. It is learned that Director Xia of the bureau had dispatched a machine from Beijing on the afternoon of the 10th to transport 3.5 billion gold yuan coupons for relief. The station immediately distributed the funds to the workers at Jiang'an Station, and the Commander's Office allocated 500 million to assist. The employees' attitudes have now eased, and the situation will soon subside.</p>

<h3>He, Yu, Gan Training Corps Rebels Return Gradually; Wuxing Residents Feel More Secure; A Student Publishes a Confession Describing Being Deceived</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxing Tenth] A portion of the Jiaxing Youth Reserve Cadre Training Corps, estimated at over eight hundred students, arrived within the borders of this county with weapons. The local security authorities dispatched teams to prevent their entry, creating a tense situation and causing widespread anxiety. Fortunately, the students did not come into contact with local militia along their route, and thus no battles occurred. In various townships, one hundred and two individuals have voluntarily surrendered their weapons and have been sent back to the original training corps in Jiaxing. The main force is currently near Sanchiao Wharf in Wukang, with indications of entering Tianmu Mountain. There are also scattered, errant students in townships such as Taixi, Meifeng, Changchao, and Nanxun. The First District Commissioner dispatched Deputy Commander Lang on the ninth to offer amnesty and a chance for self-renewal. The tense situation in the urban area is gradually easing, and entertainment venues have resumed normal operations. Public sentiment is also becoming more stable. According to one of the students, Yi Kaitai, who submitted a written confession in Nanxun and presented it to the town chief, Chen, the original text is as follows: "On the afternoon of April 6th, at 10 PM, a sense of tension suddenly arose. We were told that there would be a war preparedness military exercise that night. I quickly packed my luggage, and then we were issued weapons and ammunition, and we prepared all the necessary items to carry. Things that were inconvenient to carry were sent to nearby residents' homes. However, the gates were under strict guard, and we were unable to take things out. We had no choice but to leave them in the barracks and wait for departure. But rumors spread, such as 'We are ordered to go to Fujian or Jiangxi' and 'The war preparedness exercise will take about three days.' We were completely confused. As dawn approached, after finishing breakfast, there were also rumors that Teams 15 and 16 would not leave because the destination was unknown. However, a few students in our team advocated not leaving, but the majority believed that this was an order. We didn't know what we were doing, and if we didn't go, we feared we would be punished. The order was issued by the General Commander for a 'war preparedness exercise.' We students were unable to understand the General Commander's intentions and were unaware of his internal changes. We could only obey the order. The General Commander was appointed by the state, and obeying him meant obeying the state. Moreover, in a military training institution, a war preparedness exercise is a part of the curriculum. As soldiers, our duty is obedience, so we had no reason not to follow. Little did we know that he was deceiving and blinding us, this group of youths. His orders changed, and he launched a rebellious and ambitious action, turning passionate youths into his personal capital, to sacrifice for his ambitions. However, we have passion and even more reason. In our hearts, we only love the country and the people. We are determined to sacrifice for the masses of people, and we absolutely refuse to obey ambitious rebels who seek to seize power. Therefore, during the march, upon learning of the 'rebellion,' I immediately left the team and departed. Hearing that Jiaxing was not allowing us to enter the city, I decided to return home to my native place, to farm and support my parents, and to enjoy the joy of family reunion. Passing through your district, I was detained by comrades of your department, who said that I would be welcome to return to my original unit. Yi Kaitai drafted this."</p>
<h3>Under Pressure from Congress, the US Government Will Consider Changing its China Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Tenth] Congressional opponents of the State Department's China policy told the United Press today that they believe there are now signs that the US government's views on China may be shifting. Democratic Senator McCarran said he believes congressional pressure will force the government to consider some changes. Republican Congressman Judd said he believes the recent debate on the Economic Cooperation Administration amendment and the response of the House Foreign Affairs Committee publicly abandoned the so-called Marshall policy.</p>
<p>McCarran said, "I believe that when the State Department understands the attitude of Congress, the department will change, and it should change quickly. Congress has recently tried to obtain a definition of policy from the State Department, which shows the attitude of Congress."</p>
<p>Judd's remarks are based on the reply of Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Kee. During the debate, Kee was questioned, "Do we mean that under this bill (extending the payment of the Economic Cooperation Administration's $54 million to 1950), we will not aid any government that is allied with the Communist Party, regardless of whether the Communist Party controls that government?" Kee answered in the affirmative. According to Judd, speaking to the United Press, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, although a Democrat, admitted that the policy of alliance with the Communist Party in China was a mistake. If it is a mistake now, then it must have been a mistake in the past.</p>
<p>Whether Congress will agree with Judd's assumption can only be determined by a vote, but both the House and Senate have voted by large majorities to extend the Economic Cooperation Administration's payment deadline to aid Nationalist China.</p>
<p>McCarran and Judd both said that there are signs that Congress disagrees with the State Department's wait-and-see policy. McCarran said that the best evidence is that 25 Democratic and Republican senators signed a letter to Secretary of State Acheson last month, urging new military and economic aid to the Nationalist government. Prior to that, 51 Republican congressmen sent a letter to Truman, asking him to respond to the China policy. Acheson has tried to respond to the bipartisan members of the Administrative Conference.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on the so-called Marshall policy, a State Department official said there was nothing new in Kee's reply. The official reiterated Truman's press conference on March 11, 1948, during which someone asked whether Marshall's delegation and the expansion of the Nationalist government's base meant accommodating the Communist Party. Truman replied that he did not believe Marshall intended to bring any communists into the Chinese government and further stated, "If we can help it, we do not want a communist government in China or anywhere else."</p>
<p>The attitude of many officials in the State Department is that Marshall tried to help the Chinese resolve their disputes, but this attempt ended when Marshall left China, and it has since been a matter solely for the Chinese. However, members of Congress such as McCarran and Judd hold different views, saying that the State Department ignored Congress's warnings and insisted on a coalition government between the Nationalists and Communists.</p>

<h3>Establishment of a German Autonomous Government; The Three-Power Plan Encounters Obstacles; The German Social Democratic Party Stresses a Centralized System</h3>
<p>[Reported News] New York Eleventh Radio Broadcast: Bonn News, The plan of the Western German occupation authorities to rebuild the German autonomous government seems to have been hampered today due to the attitude of the German Social Democratic Party. After holding an emergency meeting, the Social Democratic Party decided to reject the occupation authorities' plan to establish a loose federal government. The party insists on establishing a strong centralized government. This requirement of the party has been repeatedly rejected by the occupation authorities, but the party is still determined not to yield. The occupation authorities were quite surprised by this reaffirmation of their position, because the political advisors of the three-nation occupation forces of the United States, Britain and France had previously expected that the party would eventually yield. A spokesman for the Social Democratic Party, Hain, said that the party has made concessions to the point where there is no more room for concessions. From now on, it will be up to the Christian Democratic Party to take compromise steps.</p>
<p>[United Press Bonn Tenth] The liaison officers of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, delivered the new German occupation regulations to Anterno, the Speaker of the West German Constituent Assembly today, but no ceremony was held. After German political leaders discussed it at An's residence for half an hour, none of them showed joy and decided not to express their opinions for 48 hours. Vice Speaker Sopherte was flushed, while Social Democratic leader Schmidt and Christian Democratic leader Casep were serious. An has summoned the Occupation Regulations Committee to meet on the 11th to review the matter. On the 12th, the committee will hold talks with the prime ministers of the eleven states in West Germany, and then on the 13th, the Constituent Assembly will issue a communiqué. The Constituent Assembly can send representatives to visit the military governors of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, on the 14th to report everything.</p>
<p>[United Press Bonn Eleventh] German political leaders expressed indifference to the new occupation regulations in West Germany. Although the regulations give Germans the highest degree of autonomy within the scope of military security, they are full of restrictions and reservations. The "Social Democratic" newspaper criticized the Allies for continuing to control German industrial and commercial research for fear of German competition. The newspaper commented that this move is really intolerable. Only by allowing Germans to participate in technical development industries can the German economy participate in the competition in the world market. In addition, the Allied control of Germany's foreign relations will make it impossible for Germany to recover in Europe or obtain an equal position in the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington Eleventh] Radio commentator Pearson announced last night that after the implementation of the new German occupation regulations, the director of the International Bank, McLoy, will succeed Clay as the US High Commissioner to West Germany.</p>

<h3>Guerrillas Launch New Offensive; Greece Calls on Allied Forces to Intervene; Conspiracy to Assassinate Prominent Greek Figures is Cracked</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Athens Tenth] Officials announced today that Greek guerrillas have launched a new offensive in the Grammos Mountain area. The Greek Army General Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that rebel forces attacked villages such as Chlofti and Okios, but were repelled.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Athens Tenth] Athens Radio called on the Allied forces in Greece to intervene today. When mentioning the "invasion of the Grammos Mountain area prepared in Albanian territory" in the broadcast, it said that if the Allies want to maintain peace, they must take action quickly. Nine years after the totalitarian country invaded Greek territory, Greece is still continuing to fight for its territorial integrity and political independence. However, the Greek army, which only receives material assistance, is today abiding by international treaties in its struggle, and the restrictions stipulated in these treaties prevent it from pursuing invaders to their bases as it did when Italy invaded in 1940. Therefore, the hopes of free people should not be disappointed. The Allied forces should take action on the battlefield, just as they took action in Africa after winning in Albania in 1940.</p>
<p>[Reuters Athens Eleventh] The Greek Ministry of Public Security announced that it has captured 80 communists who attempted to assassinate prominent figures.

<h3>Nehru to Present New Plan for Anglo-Indian Relations to the Commonwealth Conference; India to Maintain Ties with Britain After Independence</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New Delhi, 10th] It has been learned from reliable sources on the 10th that Indian Prime Minister Nehru will attend the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London on April 21st to propose suggestions regarding the future relationship between India and the British Commonwealth. According to reliable sources, Nehru raised the following two suggestions in the Indian National Congress Working Committee: (1) Recognition of Indian nationality, with each Indian citizen holding dual citizenship, being citizens of both the Republic of India and the United Kingdom; (2) A plan for India to continue to maintain ties with the British Commonwealth after independence. It is said that India is preparing to formulate a certain formula under which the British monarch will retain the title of First Citizen of the Commonwealth, but in other matters, his status will be equal to that of the President of the Republic of India. Therefore, the appointment of Indian diplomatic personnel will be by the Indian President rather than the British monarch. British citizens in India should pledge allegiance to the Indian President (as the representative of the British monarch), while Indian citizens in Britain should pledge allegiance to the British monarch.</p>
<h3>India Does Not Plan to Participate in War If It Breaks Out</h3>
<p>Nehru's Remarks to Reporters</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 10th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru told reporters from the Daily Mail in New Delhi today that if war breaks out, India may not participate. Nehru admitted, "If war breaks out in any location, it is likely to affect the entire globe. India may need to participate for the sake of its own interests, but it will depend on the circumstances. A friendly India, with good relations with other republics, will be more valuable to other republics than the limited military assistance India can provide. India, like other republics, can avoid participating in or becoming involved in any war involving the United Kingdom. Europe has always been the center, while Asia is only on the periphery of the world's center of gravity, but Asia has not yet become the location of major peasant movements, as can be seen in the turbulent situation in many Asian countries." Nehru also said that a republican India can easily fit into the Commonwealth of Republics, as only the format needs to be changed.</p>
<h3>Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu Visits Nehru</h3>
<p>Says Rebellion Can Be Resolved Soon in Calcutta</p>

When a reporter asked how long the rebellion in Burma would last, Thakin Nu replied: It can be resolved in the short term. He also said that if India and Britain could provide Burma with a large amount of military equipment, the rebellion in Burma could be quelled quickly.</p>
<h3>Truman to Urge Congress to Expedite Ratification of Atlantic Pact; Connally Argues Military Aid Costs Should Be Reduced as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally said on the 11th that the cost of rearming Europe must be "reduced as much as possible." Truman may ask the Senate on the evening of the 11th to expedite the ratification of the Atlantic Pact, an action that will inevitably trigger new demands for full intelligence regarding the US military aid plan to Western Europe.</p>
<p>Connally said: "The military aid plan must be coordinated with the Marshall Plan, the defense plan, and other resources. This is a large whole and must be handled properly so that we do not allow any plan to conflict with or hinder other plans." Connally said: "Full and open" hearings on the Atlantic Pact will take about a month. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin hearings on the treaty on the 18th, and there is generally no doubt that the two-thirds vote required for the Senate to pass the treaty will be obtained.</p>

<h3>Why is the United States Losing Ground in Asia?</h3>
<p>— Translated Manuscript from the Editorial Department of this Newspaper</p>
<p>The United States is gradually losing ground in Asia. From North China to the Java Sea, anti-American sentiment is surging and spreading to other places. The biggest reason is that the United States is assisting Japan before other countries. Improper policies towards China and the activities of Asian communists are also major reasons for weakening American influence. The goodwill and friendliness that Asians had for Uncle Sam have disappeared. Replacing it is suspicion and resentment.</p>
<p>Americans are gradually losing face in the East. The goodwill and beneficence that the United States accumulated during World War II is about to run dry. In the vast region inhabited by one billion people, the near-hero worship that they expressed for the United States a few years ago is now gradually turning into deep-seated resentment.</p>
<p>A reporter for "U.S. News &amp; World Report" recently traveled through the Far East for eight months, from Japan and China, across the South Pacific, through India and Arab countries to the Mediterranean. The general impression he gained from this region is: Asians are waking up from their dream of America—painfully and thoroughly.</p>
<p>Thoughtful people in Asia are worried that American policy aims to rebuild Japan. They are indignant at American policy towards China and suspicious of American motives in striving for national independence in Indonesia, Vietnam, and other regions. People generally feel that American policy—or the lack of a comprehensive and holistic Asian policy—not only alienates a billion friends and powerful allies but also causes millions of bewildered people to lean towards the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Asian Nations' Hostility Towards the US</p>
<p>Asian nations' distrust of the United States is deepening. A reporter who traveled thousands of miles was repeatedly asked: "Why does the United States betray Asian nations?" The first person to ask this question was a Japanese economist who emerged from seclusion to assist in the occupation mission but, after being confused by American policies and actions, retired again after a year. A Korean labor leader also raised the same question shortly before his assassination.</p>
<p>A Chinese philosopher (who blamed the chaos in his country on the United States), a Filipino journalist, a local engineer working underground in French Vietnam, an Indonesian student, a Burmese political scientist, and an Indian professor raised this difficult question using similar words.</p>
<p>During the period of Japan's defeat, these many people were all ardent admirers of the United States. This reverence has now almost disappeared. In the vast region of the East, plagued by famine, low living standards, and political unrest, friendliness towards the United States is gradually cooling down. After careful examination of all levels and hundreds of interviews, the crux of the Far East problem was pointed out.</p>
<p>In the past year or two, due to the trend of American policy towards Japan, people in various parts of Asia have deepened their hostility towards the United States. Chinese of all parties are deeply afraid that the United States will restore Japan's combat power. The reporter heard a prime minister, a businessman, a labor leader, a journalist, and a banker express this fear in succession within a week. They unanimously felt that establishing a strong Japan in the chaotic East has the tendency to preserve the strength of the militarists who launched the war in the past.</p>
<p>Not only are the Chinese like this, but the Filipinos are even more resentful of American policy in Japan. The Filipinos feel that the defeated country has now transformed into the victor, while the victor is being treated as the defeated country.</p>
<p>Most Asians attach great importance to American concerns about the Soviet Union. What they suspect is that the United States wants to turn Japan into a bulwark against the Soviet Union, but it has neglected the democratization of the former enemy. They believe that even if Japan can become strong, it is unlikely to become democratic.</p>
<p>As a result, in places like the Philippines, people's goodwill towards the United States is gradually showing signs of decline. As Filipinos feel that the United States is more concerned about Japan's recovery than the Philippines' recovery, the infinite enthusiasm for the United States when it granted the Philippines independence is gradually waning.</p>
<p>Procrastination in Policy Towards China</p>
<p>Like in other parts of the East, the Chinese respect for the United States is gradually declining. The United States is in an unpleasant situation. The Communist Party has always rejected American policy towards China, and the non-Communist opposition to President Chiang accuses the United States of maintaining Chiang's power with more than two billion US dollars in aid since World War II. Now even Chiang's most powerful supporters are gradually becoming hostile to the United States, accusing American aid of being too little and too late to prevent the expansion of Communist power.</p>
<p>The "U.S. News &amp; World Report" reporter interviewed a Chinese professor who seemed to express an attitude that represents the majority opinion. He, a Kuomintang member and a follower of Sun Yat-sen, had already joined the anti-Chiang front before the CCP launched its winter offensive and won successive victories. He told the reporter: "You Americans should be held responsible for prolonging the Chinese civil war. If it weren't for your intervention, we would have ended this bloody tragedy long ago, which is what we all sincerely prayed for. If you continue to support Chiang, the United States will lose all of its Chinese friends, and the CCP will inevitably conquer all of China." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Grain Purchase and Storage Meeting Decides to Purchase Rice in Large Quantities Domestically and Abroad; Hope for Continued US Aid Rice from July</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] City Government Secretary-General Chen Liang attended the grain purchase and storage meeting held by the Shanghai Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration this afternoon at 3 p.m. According to Secretary-General Chen, when he met with reporters after the meeting, the resolutions of the meeting were as follows: (1) A decision was made to negotiate the purchase of 62,000 tons of rice from abroad. (2) A decision was made to procure 600,000 dan of rice domestically, which will be procured by the competent authorities or entrusted to grain merchants. (3) There is hope for continued US aid relief rice for this city from July. The Deputy Director of the Shanghai Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration told Dr. Yen Hui-ching, who attended the meeting, in a very pleasant tone that the U.S. is willing to do its best to assist with the city's rice distribution problem.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Chen also told reporters that regarding the rice price issue, the government's current policy is not absolute control but rather a moderate, flexible, and non-dangerous regulation. It is not that the city government cannot forcefully suppress rice prices, but it is concerned that if high pressure is applied, there may be a problem with the availability of rice. Relevant agencies such as the National Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the Shanghai Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration have decided to establish close contact to provide appropriate regulation of rice prices. According to Secretary-General Chen's analysis, the factor driving up rice prices is the mutual influence of the gold and silver speculation. In the past, rice prices had fixed ratios, generally believed to be equal to the price of five US dollars and ten silver yuan. Now that the prices of US dollars and silver yuan are constantly rising, it will naturally stimulate the rise in rice prices. He also said that Police Chief Mao Sen, due to the recent sharp rise in rice prices, called Secretary-General Chen around 12:00 a.m. the day before yesterday to inquire whether rice merchants should be punished. Secretary-General Chen told him that if rice merchants have not intentionally exceeded the price limit, the arrest should be postponed.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Chen's opinion on suppressing rice prices is that the government can imitate the current socialistic approach of the British Labour Party by implementing full rationing for rice. Currently, the rationing of household rice has solved two-thirds of the city's needs, with the remaining one-third coming from the free market. If the government can find a way to implement full rationing, it can curb the violent rise in rice prices.</p>
<h3>The Grain Storage Committee Has Completed One-Third of the Urban Food Rationing Plan for May and June</h3>

The food rationing for the four cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Qingdao will continue in May and June, requiring a total of 129,000 metric tons of rice and 16,000 metric tons of flour, which will be sourced equally from the US and China. So far, China has prepared 28,000 metric tons of rice and 2,600 metric tons of flour, and the Grain Purchase Committee is actively working to obtain the remaining amount. The US and China have preliminarily agreed on the following urban food supply plan for May and June: (1) Nanjing: Requires 42,000 metric tons of rice per month, which will be fully supplied by China in May and June. (2) Shanghai: Requires 42,000 metric tons of rice per month, with China supplying 19,750 metric tons per month and the US supplying the remainder. (3) Guangzhou: Requires 13,500 metric tons of rice per month, with China supplying 3,375 metric tons per month and the US supplying the remainder. (4) Qingdao: Requires 8,000 metric tons of flour per month, which will be fully supplied by the US in May and fully supplied by China in June.</p>
<p>[Another Report] 8,500 tons of US aid rice arrived here on the 9th from Siam for distribution in Shanghai. Another batch of 9,100 tons of rice is scheduled to be delivered on April 18th. In addition, 96,000 tons of rice will be shipped to China between now and June 30th. The Economic Cooperation Administration rice currently en route to China or already approved for purchase, as well as the rice that the Chinese government has designated for purchase, is sufficient to ensure the continuation of rationing until the end of June. The rice to be unloaded in China includes 30,000 tons of American rice, with the remainder to be purchased in Southeast Asia. The Economic Cooperation Administration rice shipped to China will be used to support the rationing programs in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shantou. The Chinese government is currently handling the rationing in Nanjing entirely on its own, as Nanjing is closer to domestic rice-producing areas. The rationing in Qingdao is being handled with American flour from the Economic Cooperation Administration.</p>

<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Strives to Simplify Commercial Registration Procedures</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has recently been striving to simplify commercial registration procedures to provide as much convenience as possible to citizens. In the past, it was stipulated that industrial and commercial firms that were approved to sell rationed materials should, when applying for registration, submit a guarantee certificate issued by two registered firms in the same industry in accordance with the rules for preventing speculation by merchants and residents. Now, this method is no longer applicable and only increases the trouble for merchants and residents. It has been submitted to this municipal government meeting for approval to abolish it, effective April 11. It has also been stipulated that the period from application to issuance of the certificate will be at most two weeks. If a registration has been applied for to the bureau and no notification of certificate receipt has been received after two weeks, the receipt number can be directly noted in a written inquiry to the bureau's First Division or the Industrial and Commercial Registration Office.</p>

<h3>Industrial Raw Material Issues: Continued Symposium, Enamel and Other Industries Express Difficulties, All Hoping to Promote Material Exchange</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau continued to convene a symposium yesterday on the supply and demand of various industrial raw materials in the city. The results of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enamel Industry: The main raw materials are black iron sheets and six other items. The quota for the fifth and sixth quarters is US$160,000, which is only about 20% of the required amount. The market inventory of this raw material is also not abundant, and the current inventory is only enough for one month. The difficulties faced by the industry are: (1) Imported raw materials cannot be shipped due to the suspension of export licenses. (2) Sales in North China have stagnated, and the selling price of finished products is lower than the cost, and factories will be forced to reduce or suspend work. (3) The monthly demand for fuel diesel is 700 tons, but currently only 40% is allocated, which is extremely difficult. The industry hopes: (1) that the government will relax the foreign exchange quota for black iron sheets to increase imports and maintain production. (2) Please ask the Social Affairs Bureau to transfer the matter to the relevant authorities to expedite negotiations with the US Commercial Consul in Shanghai to issue export permits for black iron sheets ordered from the United States by various enamel factories. (3) The diesel allocation is insufficient, please forward a letter to the Diesel Allocation Committee to increase the allocation.</p>
<p>Leather Manufacturing Industry: The main raw materials are (1) raw cowhide (demand of 1 million pounds), (2) raw sheepskin (demand of 180,000 pounds), (3) chemical raw materials (such as tanning agents). The supply of hides is scarce and the price is high, currently only enough for twelve days of use. Tanning agents can be used for two weeks. The government is requested to provide loans to store and purchase raw materials and to facilitate sources from North China.</p>
<p>Seasoning Powder Industry: The raw materials are carbon powder and caustic soda. To store six months of raw materials, 30,000 pounds of carbon powder and 170,000 pounds of caustic soda are needed. The difficulties faced by the industry are: (1) The monthly fuel requirement is 800 tons, and the coal inventory is insufficient. (2) Gold is insufficient for turnover. The industry requests: (1) that the scope of industrial loans be broadened to include the seasoning powder industry. (2) Increase coal allocation. (3) Realize the exchange of materials between North and South.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke-qiang and Others' Embezzlement Case: Individual Interrogations Last Five Hours; Zhang Zheng-wu Glared and Scolded, Stating the Extortion Situation in Court</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Sun Ke-qiang, the former head of the Zhabei Police Station, was accused of corruption and dereliction of duty. He was sent to the District Court for detention along with the other three defendants: Zhang Liang-zhu, a police officer from the Tianshengqiao Police Station; Zhang Zheng-wu, a police officer from the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau; and Jin Yi-qing, a police officer from the Gonghe Road Police Station. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Judge Ou Sheng-he held the first trial. After five hours of individual interrogations, the court adjourned at 2:00 PM and ordered further investigations before another trial. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<p>The charges against the first defendant, Sun Ke-qiang, are: (1) embezzling donations from the Winter Defense Mutual Aid Association in the district; (2) extorting citizens for illegal construction; and (3) protecting his subordinates to extort Ren Zhi-yan, a monk from the Taiyang Temple. Ren Zhi-yan was also summoned to testify about the incident yesterday. The court, considering the seriousness of the case, adopted individual interrogations, prohibited family members of the defendants and bystanders from entering and leaving at will, and declined reporters' requests to take photos. The atmosphere in the courtroom was very serious.</p>
<p>The Taiyang Temple Monk Testified in Detail</p>
<p>The first to testify was the temple monk Ren Zhi-yan, who stated: He has been a monk for 26 years. Fourteen years ago, following his elder brother's wishes, he lived with Xie Xing-gu. They initially lived on Wenzhou Road in the city, moved to Ningbo during the war, and returned to Shanghai after the war, living on Xinmin Road. Both places have registered residences, with Xie as the head of the household. On the 11th of last month, late at night, while he and Xie were staying on Datong Road, two policemen suddenly broke into the door, holding flashlights, and in a menacing manner, accused him of being reported for colluding with bandits and obstructing public morals, and were ordered by the director of the sub-bureau to investigate. If he was willing to pay two gold bars, the case could be closed. Then they ransacked the room and conducted a major search. He handed over all of his 4,000 yuan in cash and two gold rings. He was still tied up and taken to the Datong Road Police Station. At 10:00 AM on the 12th, he was escorted to the Zhabei Sub-bureau's judicial section for interrogation and was released on bail in the evening. After the testimony, the court ordered the four defendants to be brought to the court, and Ren identified Zhang Zheng-wu as the one who took the stolen goods. Zhang Liang-zhu and Jin Yi-qing were waiting outside the door. Another person in a black coat was the guide, Zhang Zhi-fang, who is related to Zhang Zheng-wu.</p>
<p>The Court Was Furious at the Situation</p>
<p>Zhang Liang-zhu then testified: On the evening of March 11, Director Sun of the sub-bureau telephoned the patrol officer Wang Jie of the police station to handle the case. Wang was not in the station, so he was ordered to go to Sun's house, hand over the confidential report, and ask him to investigate. He then went with Jin Yi-qing, a police officer from the Gonghe Road Police Station, and Zhang Zhi-fang, the guide, introduced Zhang Zheng-wu, a police officer from the Xincheng Sub-bureau, to assist. After arriving at Ren's house, he and Jin waited outside the door. Zhi-fang and Zheng-wu went upstairs. He also went upstairs to inquire. The monk and Xie Xing-gu initially claimed to be uncle and niece, but later changed their story to husband and wife, and they had no identification. Suspecting their intentions, they wanted to take them to the bureau. The monk then offered 4,000 yuan and two gold rings to bribe them, which he refused. He brought the stolen goods to the bureau as evidence. Zhang Zheng-wu testified: Although he was not ordered by his superiors to investigate the case, he agreed to assist because the monk was suspected of colluding with bandits. The court then ordered him and Ren Zhi-yan to stand face to face and demonstrate the extortion situation that night. Zhang glared at Ren with a threatening attitude and scolded Ren, "Don't fart." The court was furious at the situation.</p>
<p>Vehemently Denying All Accusations</p>
<p>After interrogating Jin Yi-qing, Sun Ke-qiang was brought to testify. He stated that the confidential report he received was provided by Huang De-sheng, who claimed that Ren Zhi-yan was colluding with bandits and plotting against him, and that he had committed adultery with his wife. He also claimed that Ren had contacted Officer Guo of the Gonghe Road Police Station in the district, so he ordered the Tianshengqiao Police Station to send officers to investigate. He vehemently denied the accusations of protecting his subordinates to extort money and preventing the criminals from being sent to the General Bureau after the incident. Regarding the discrepancies between his testimony and the investigation report made by the judicial section of the bureau, he argued that it was due to the different testimonies on which they were based.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of the Winter Defense Mutual Aid Association in the district and the collection and expenditure of donations from merchants, Sun stated: The Winter Defense Mutual Aid Association was proposed by local people in December last year. Although the General Bureau did not explicitly approve the fundraising, it was reported at the meeting. A total of more than 40,000 yuan was raised, of which more than 10,000 yuan was collected by the volunteer police, and the remaining funds were kept by Xu Yang, the patrol officer of the district. The expenditures were handled by him. Two expenses were recorded in the account, one for 7,200 yuan and one for 11,700 yuan. He has forgotten whether they were spent by him. Among the funds raised, he purchased two barrels of gasoline, one barrel was handed over to the bureau, and the other is still in custody.</p>
<p>Further Investigation Required, Trial to be Rescheduled</p>
<p>The court asked why the public property was stored in a private home? And why it had not been handed over after the incident in March of this year? Sun claimed that because the bureau was far from Zhabei, he bought the oil in the city and stored it near his home. Because someone said that the price of the oil was too high, he ordered the person in charge to submit the receipts, so he delayed sending it to the bureau. As for the accusations of extorting bribes from citizens for illegal construction, he completely denied them, claiming that there were too many refugees in the district, and they were building sheds at any time, which was difficult to control. Finally, Ji Xiu-cheng, the head of the general affairs section of the district, Xu Yang, the patrol officer, and Xu Zhao-zhen, the section chief of the Taifeng Yarn Factory, were summoned. They all said that the donations raised by the Winter Defense Mutual Aid Association were handed over to Sun for responsible allocation, but they did not know how they were allocated. At this point, the court ordered further investigation and rescheduled the trial. The court adjourned at 2:00 PM.</p>

According to the complaint: In June last year, it was learned that the Taiwan Paper Industry Corporation, based on the government's original intention of supporting industry and commerce, would allocate raw materials required by various manufacturers at low prices, and the allocation price was only about 20-30% of the market price. They immediately prepared a document to apply for the allocation of 20 tons of yellow board paper. Afterwards, there was no reply for a long time. At first, it was thought that Taiwan Paper Industry Corporation did not approve it, but at the beginning of this year, it was discovered that other manufacturers had been allocated one after another. After inquiring with Taiwan Paper Industry Corporation, they learned that the above-mentioned yellow board paper had already been used by Ye to impersonate the name of the Guohua Factory, privately carving a rubber stamp, and purchasing all of it under the name of the manager as early as July 19, 1937, and using it privately. At that time, the market price had reached more than 58 million legal tender per ton, and they requested the court to order the return of 20 tons of yellow board paper. The court, considering that both parties were friends, ordered a trial reconciliation and rescheduled the trial.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Postman from Telecommunications Bureau Specializes in Stealing Bicycles, Case Solved</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] On the 31st of last month, the Laozha Police Sub-bureau received a confidential report that someone was stealing bicycles near Guangdong Road and Fujian Road. Section Chief Zhang ordered officers Song Shao-mei and Xue Yun-bai to supervise the officers Xu Zi-chang, Du Guo-zhen, Li Yu-ran, and Song Shao-ke to rush to the address. They arrested Shen Hui-ming. According to his confession, he is 20 years old, from Pudong, and was formerly a postman in the Telecommunications Bureau, but was dismissed for some reason. Because the cost of living has been high recently, he still wears the uniform and hat of the Telecommunications Bureau and steals bicycles everywhere to sell for a living. He has committed 24 bicycle thefts in total. All the stolen goods were sold to Zhang A-tao and You A-huo and other eight people who set up hardware stalls in Yuegui Lane, Guangdong Road. The handling police officers went to recover the stolen goods and have recovered 11 stolen bicycles and arrested the recipients. They were all brought to the bureau for interrogation and the case will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal proceedings on schedule.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Staff Embezzlement Case: Lawyers Request Leniency</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] He Kai-you, a driver of the Ship Repair Department of the UNRRA Rehabilitation Enterprise Committee Custodial Committee from Ningbo, Lan Xin-shi-gan, a cargo officer, Berlo, an inspector, and White-cliff, an engineer, all stateless White Russians, were accused of collective embezzlement. From November to December last year, the four people, including He, repeatedly stole public materials, divided the proceeds and used them. Later, Fan Jia-lin, the purchaser, discovered that the source was unknown and reported it to the Hongkou Police Sub-bureau. The case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution and was tried by the District Court. The defendants were released on bail. The court held another hearing yesterday. He and Lan appeared in court with their defense lawyers. He argued that he was a car driver and that Berlo was his direct superior. Everything was carried out under Berlo's orders, and he did not know anything about the crimes. Lan only admitted to participating in one theft. The defense lawyers then requested leniency on the grounds that the defendants' salaries were meager and insufficient to support their families, and that the crimes were only committed for the first time. The court announced that the sentencing would be held on the morning of the 18th of this month. Both defendants Berlo and White have fled abroad, and only their guarantors Zhou Mao-jin, Du Xiao-yuan, and Yang Ma-zhi appeared in court. The court was very angry about this and ordered Zhou and others to urge Berlo and White to return to the country as soon as possible, otherwise they would be held liable for the bail.</p>

<h3>Grassland Recruitment! (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Sai</p>
<p>"On the 9th, the Kanggan natives presented cattle as a welcome gift. We went to comfort them, but instead, they comforted us. Although we had a feast, our consciences were uneasy. On the 10th, a living Buddha requested that we send a doctor to treat his fellow Buddhist. I went with him to Amo Kase. The living Buddha had a three-point beard, resembling a villain in a stage play. He suffered from arthritis and needed a cane to walk. A silver medal was later awarded."</p>
<p>"On the 11th, we set up camp in the Sheye Ke Basin. It hailed and snowed. Legend has it that a goddess named Ren Zhi hid in the mountains. She encountered a strong man from the Yak Valley who was trading. After they had illicit relations, he lied and said he would welcome her after returning home. After being deceived, the goddess vowed that whenever a man from the Yak Valley passed by, she would send snowballs to kill him. Among our group, there were two men from the Yak Valley, so it felt like we were accompanying them to their execution ground."</p>
<p>"On the 12th, we passed Fang Gou Nawo Mountain, and on the 13th, we arrived at A Zhong Meng. The population gradually thinned. On the 14th, we crossed the Kaxi River on wooden rafts. Old subjects of Kang Kemin presented sheep and fish. In the evening, everyone ate their fill. The taste of the fish was heavenly. On the 15th, we passed the Daqing Yan'e (meaning 'Great Horse Tail Plain') horse-producing area. The Great Horse Valley and Little Horse Valley had healthy horse herds. The village here had over 400 households, all under the jurisdiction of the Aqugele Temple. Commander Ma conveyed the government's concern for the 52 tribes on the grassland."</p>
<p>Crossing the Reke River</p>
<p>"On the 17th, we crossed the Shuke River. Near the water, I remembered this local mountain song: 'Water, it's scary to avoid it, but you can go around it. Rain in the sky, there's no way to dodge it. Your own officers, you're afraid of them, but you can also avoid them. A match made in heaven, there's no way to dodge it.' On the 7th, we passed the Huowen Yu Li Gong Mountain, Ruo Mo Cliff, Gan Duo Dove, and on the 17th, we arrived at Gongma Sang. Zhan Jinshui was welcomed. They sat on the ground and ate raisins, sesame cakes, rock candy, and spicy buns. He met Kang Kemin's 19-year-old mistress, Zhebi. He wrote: 'We talked about these private matters behind closed doors to prevent his people from eavesdropping.' But he also wrote: 'Getting back to business, all the handles the government had on the Kang official were destroyed in Ma Bufang's military disaster.' He also recorded the traces left by Ma Bufang's looting of cattle and horses. In addition, some people's folk customs, visits to temples, acceptance of cattle and sheep, local life sketches, and trivial photography of Yi minorities are all insignificant. Before his death, Jinshui had continuously published his 'Grassland Journey' in Rongxin's 'New News.'"</p>
<p>Hope for Boundary Demarcation</p>
<p>During their ground banquet in Gongma Sang, they sang songs, and Zhebo sang: "A bottle of wine, not offered to a single Bodhisattva. A bag of bullets, not fired at a single enemy. A belly full of secrets, only one person knows." The Kang official sang: "The earth's clothes are the sun, the people's food is crops. Everyone fears him, everyone respects him, that is President Chiang!" From his songs, he was filled with hatred for Ma Bufang and the fervent request for the government to demarcate the boundaries. Even Jinshui couldn't help but sing, "The sun in the sky is like a sutra wheel, the flowers on the ground are embroidered brocade," and so on.</p>
<p>When they reached the White Clothes Temple in Shangda'er Tang, monks led by Huang Luan welcomed them. The living Buddha in the temple was polite to them, saying that he was very grateful for the government's concern and very appreciative of everyone's arduous journey, but he apologized for the poor hospitality in the remote border area. He also said: "It is an undeniable fact that Siguo Lu belongs to Sichuan. We hope the government will demarcate the boundary as soon as possible to eliminate the wolf's heart and see the light again."</p>
<p>Jinshui wrote: "My wife telegraphed to ask when I could return. There is still a long way to go, and it will be after the Double Ninth Festival. I wanted to reply by telegraph, but the radio station had already been destroyed."</p>
<p>On July 24th, they left Gongma Sang, and Commander Ma stayed behind. Zhebo accompanied them, singing loudly and racing horses. They crossed the Erhekou, turned northwest, and went up along the Ma'er River, passing the Hongzhuzi Mountain and Zhengzhong Niuma Mountain. On the 26th, they crossed the Yellow River. He recorded the Fang wine incident. Later, Mrs. Zhan (Zhan Wu Qiushui) received his last letter, which he wrote when crossing the river. The next day, the generator's light bulb broke, and from then on, they could no longer send urgent telegrams to Chengdu.</p>
<p>He remembered the local education with great interest: "Student Chen Ying, 17 years old, was not bad-looking. One night, she was summoned by the local official." And they received some Tibetan petitions.</p>
<p>Leaving No Dog or Sheep</p>
<p>Legend has it that Qinghai had sent twenty or thirty people with radio stations and boundary markers. Jinshui's diary on August 4th said: "They are probably here to demarcate the boundary. Although rumors on the road are not credible, they have confused us. According to Mr. Guo, Tongde County in Qinghai is only three horse-station stops away from Gongma Sang. Commissioner Han there is said to be coming to negotiate with us about Hongmo Sang." In this difficult and busy situation, Jinshui wrote a poem thinking of "Traveling ten thousand miles, always a guest, I don't know when I will return to my hometown?" He said: "This is a true portrayal of our group of people bound to the Western Fan."</p>
<p>"On the 87th, we passed Yu Qusang to watch the masked dance. On the night of the 8th, Ma Shegui said that in the 27th year, Ma Bufang sent Captain Lan to be stationed at the White Temple to collect straw head tax. The Fan people were unwilling and captured Lan alive, driving him like a horse, whipping him at every step, forcing him to the Yellow River. Lan's suffering in seeking death is hard to describe. The following year, Ma sent two cavalry battalions into E Luo, killing every dog and sheep."</p>
<p>Salt Lake Dissection</p>
<p>August 9th diary was his last diary, and there was no written record after that. On that day: "It rained, and the sound of raindrops on the tent was incessant, urging the cattle and horses, which was extremely annoying. I got up at half past ten, and after fifteen li, I reached the top of Tangke Li Peng Mountain, 4,830 meters high. Looking back at the Dangji Pu Duo Plain, it was truly vast. The land below the mountain is the boundary of Hongmi Sang, and beyond that, there is no human habitation. The grass is long, but there are no cattle or horses. It is truly a pity for such a great plain. After arriving at the ××× Valley (original blank), in the distance, I saw white and black dots..."</p>
<p>In addition, there was the "Siguo Lu Incident."</p>
<p>Because when the Kang Kemin local official returned to his place, he knew that more than one hundred families of his people had moved away. In the grasslands, the power of the local officials is determined by the number of people, the more people, the higher the income, the stronger the military force. Why did more than one hundred families move away? It was not a simple question. Thinking that Commander Ma was an important member of the provincial government, with power and status, he asked him to bring back the one hundred plus families who had moved to Qinghai Province. Commander Ma wanted to establish his reputation in the grasslands and agreed to his request. He sent four of his eloquent and strong members (including Secretary Zhan Jinshui, who said in a letter to his wife that Commander Ma persuaded him to go for the sake of the country), two translators, and several junior officers to escort them. At the same time, he telegraphed the provincial government to ask if they could go. After six or seven days of hardship, the dispatched members finally reached the Xinchuan Administration Bureau under the jurisdiction of Qinghai, but the negotiations were unsuccessful. It was said that there was still no Han official there, and they hoped that they would walk another day to the Salt Lake. In order to obey orders and hope for a result, they went to the Salt Lake despite the hardship. Who knew that after they went, they were all detained. At this moment, the commander was still enjoying himself in Gongma Sang, enjoying the local official's delicacies and fine wines, and cordial hospitality. After learning that the members had been detained, he reported to the provincial government. In mid-August, two escorting Fan soldiers ran back to report to the commander that they had personally seen the escorting junior official being shot dead. They told the detained people, "You can go home tonight, and your guns and horses will be returned to you. Please write a receipt first!" At night, the local Xifan, who were related to the escaped Xifan, told them: "Escape quickly, otherwise there will be an unfortunate incident tonight." So the two Xifan bought two horses and fled immediately. Later, it was heard that the Xifan who had escaped were all shot, and the Han people were dissected and sunk in the Salt Lake!</p>
<p>And Ma Bufang's reply was: "The propaganda group was accused of harboring criminals, Lalao, and attempted to disrupt Tongde. For the sake of self-defense, the province refused them entry. The Sichuan propaganda group should be in Sichuan Province. Moreover, propaganda and boundary demarcation cannot be handled by one province alone. Furthermore, the boundary of this province (Qinghai) has already been clearly demarcated, so there is no need for such a long journey. Moreover, Guoluo is more than twenty stations away from Songpan and more than ten stations away from Tongde. It is even more incomprehensible to march such a long distance and work so hard. As for the incident of the comfort personnel being killed, we are not aware of it. It is best to find a way to telegraph the Sichuan troops to return to avoid escalating the situation and to stabilize the border. This telegram has been kept for reference in resolving the Siguo Lu incident."</p>
<p>Commander Ma waited in Gongma Sang for a month without any news, so he had to go back. The newspaper said that he: "Commander Ma lived in Songpan, but his purpose was different. In Songpan, people heard that the comfort group was treating illnesses in the grasslands. Penicillin cost fifty 'Yuan Shikai' coins per shot, and 914 cost twenty 'Yuan Shikai' coins per shot per injection. For this trip, Commander Ma had nothing to gain except for fox skins, cattle, horses, and silver dollars. Because the local officials in the grasslands showed respect for the government officials, heavy gifts were the only expression, only the yaks suffered, as they were weighed down by fox skins and Yuan Shikai! The fat cattle and strong horses gifted by the local officials formed a team, collecting from one village after another. In order to avoid the eyes and ears of others, the cattle and horses were sold on the spot. After he arrived in Songpan, all that was left were more than ten horses and more than ten cattle. It is said that two more had been taken to Chengdu. I don't know whose wealth it is."</p>
<p>The Commander is Detained</p>
<p>On January 19, 1949, Ma Bijie returned, and the families of the four victims detained Commander Ma, who was wearing a fox skin and a fox hat, with the aura of a barbarian king, and Zhan Wu Qiushui, Mo Li Wanrong, Wang Kaiyuan, Liu Shican, and other family members asked him to settle the blood debt and have a discussion.</p>
<p>The commander pointed east and west for a while. As a result, under the relentless pursuit of Xie Qusheng, Zhang Junte, Feng Xueqiao, Zhang Bohuai, and other friends from the news industry who were friends of Jinshui before his death, they asked him to provide a guarantee. The chairman and vice-chairman of the Provincial Assembly, Xiang Chuanyi and He Songshu, provided the guarantee.</p>
<p>Although some people in the newspaper shouted, "Grassland! You are a dangerous path!" but the Siguo Lu incident may become just a drop in the ocean in this great era!</p>
<h3>Exploration of the Wuyi Fluorite Mining Area (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Jiang Feng</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Jinhua 5th dispatch] Fluorite, originally named Fluorite, is a mineral belonging to the isometric crystal system. It often appears as beautiful cubic crystals, many of which are transparent and have a glass-like luster with perfect cleavage in four directions. Because the main component of the ore contains fluorine, it is called fluorite. Also, because it can emit green light like a firefly after being heated, it is commonly known as green fluorite. Fluorite is commonly green in color, and the villagers call it green stone. In fact, the color of fluorite is not only green, but also yellow, purple, light blue, reddish-brown, gray, and even colorless. The main use of fluorite is as a flux for iron smelting and a solvent for other metals, accounting for more than 80% of the total output. Other uses include the manufacture of explosives, glassware, enamelware, porcelainware, etc., and pure and transparent fluorite can be carved into various utensils and decorations.</p>
<p>The production areas of fluorite, in addition to Linxiang in Hunan, Jiaoxian in Shandong, Longhua in Jehol, and Jiaocheng in Shanxi, are most notable and abundant in Zhejiang, accounting for more than 90% of the total national output. In Zhejiang, the fluorite mines of Wuyi have the richest reserves, estimated at about 200,000 tons. The production area is estimated to be about 2479.00 hectares, with an average annual output of about 2000 tons.</p>
<p>The surface rock layer of the Wuyi fluorite mine is very shallow, only a few inches to three or five feet from the ground, so mining is very easy. As early as before 1918, local residents accidentally discovered it while clearing mountains, and thus began to dig. They soon realized that it could be exchanged for money, so they dug it manually and transported it to the river, down the Wuyi River, through Jinhua, and by boat to Hangzhou and Shanghai for sale, but the output was not large. Later, the residents realized that the economic benefits of fluorite were very large, so they started mining in groups, but limited by manual mining and transportation conditions, there was no large-scale organization. By 1934, when the construction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was completed, transportation became convenient, so private mine merchants organized companies to carry out larger-scale mining, but the mining methods were still primitive, and the output was not significant. One or two years before the Anti-Japanese War, the Zhejiang Provincial government authorities intended to organize a provincial-run company, raise funds, and purchase new mining machinery. Initial plans were made, but the war broke out, and it was suspended. After the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Incident in 1942, Jinhua, Wuyi, and other places successively fell into enemy hands. The enemy sent experts to Jinhua and Wuyi to investigate and conduct detailed surveys. In less than three months, they planned large-scale mining, requisitioned civilian labor, and built a light railway between Jinhua and Wuyi, directly to the mining area. They also transported mining machinery from Japan and forcibly conscripted thousands of civilians to carry out mining under the auspices of the puppet Central China Mining Company. At its peak, the number of miners reached tens of thousands, with a daily output of about 1,000 tons. It was transported from the Jinhua-Wuyi light railway to the Jinhua railway station for accumulation, and then transshipped to Shanghai. At that time, fluorite piled up like a mountain in the western mining area of Jinhua station. The enemy operated for three years and stole a considerable amount, about 50,000 tons or more.</p>
<p>According to local survey data, the distribution of Wuyi fluorite mines is approximately in the following areas:</p>
<p>(1) Shilonggang: Five li from the city, three li to Shuikou by waterway.

<h3>"Reader Relief Fund" Calls for Donations: Fund is About to Run Out, Launching Emergency Fundraising</h3>
<p>In order to enable poor readers who apply for the "Reader Relief Fund" to receive relief as soon as possible, and to prevent the donations from enthusiastic readers from being affected by depreciation, we have decided to change the method of disbursing the "Reader Relief Fund" from April. This method is to immediately handle the work of review and disbursement after receiving the reader's application, provided that there are no procedural errors or other concealment and fraud. We must ensure that the suffering readers who are eagerly awaiting relief receive assistance within the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>In the past week, we have issued five relief payments, and the list is as follows:</p>
<p>Ye Xiuzhen 30,000 yuan Chen Jianbo 30,000 yuan</p>
<p>Wang Nengzhi 30,000 yuan Hong Zhaonian 30,000 yuan</p>
<p>Lu Ruoyuan 30,000 yuan</p>
<p>After implementing this new method, it can be expected that the number of applicants will increase sharply, and of course, raising funds will be very urgent. Now we are making an urgent appeal to enthusiastic readers, hoping that everyone can tighten their belts and save on food and clothing to provide more relief to suffering compatriots.</p>
<h3>Septuagenarian Father Searches for Daughter: Taiwan Readers Please Note</h3>
<p>Editor: Because my hometown is no longer a safe place to live, I had no choice but to go out to visit relatives. I didn't know that my eldest daughter, Zhu Shaoyongchun, had already gone to Taiwan when I arrived in Shanghai. It is said that she is now living in the home of Wang Hansan, a former Peking University professor who runs a weaving and dyeing factory in Taiwan, but the detailed address is unclear. I am a man in my seventies and have not brought much money. My old couple is temporarily living at No. 1531 Xinzha Road, Shanghai. This is a church, and unlike a relative's home, there is no one to entertain us, and our lives have reached the end of our rope. I hope you will publish this in your newspaper and help inquire about Wang Hansan's current residence in Taiwan, so that father and daughter can still get in touch. I am very grateful.

<h3>Rampant Off-Exchange Gold Trading; National Bank Heavily Sold Off Again Yesterday, Retreating Sharply from 4 Million to 3.25 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market did not implement the cancellation of price limits and resumption of free trading, as the official order had not been received. Therefore, trading remained suspended. The opening bid in the morning reached the upper limit of 2.737 million, with demand exceeding supply and no transactions occurring. The situation remained deadlocked in the afternoon, and members left the market one after another before closing.</p>
<p>However, off-exchange trading became increasingly rampant. According to reporters, trading was divided into spot and futures. Spot trading was settled with same-day bank drafts, with immediate entry and exit. Futures required a 20% margin, with no daily settlement. Both buyers and sellers only needed to pay interest and adjust the difference, allowing for convenient trading. As a result, all parties flocked to it, and the activity was no less than that of the stock market. Yesterday, the market retreated sharply as government and merchants fiercely battled. In the morning, due to concerns about pressure, some buyers attempted to push prices up. The opening bid was 3.15 million and 3.25 million, briefly falling to 3.10 million and 3.20 million. Midway through the day, rumors of large-denomination banknotes being issued and loose credit conditions led securities firms and financial institutions to push prices up to 3.35 million and 3.40 million. The Central Bank sold 500-600 large bars at 3.30 million, but the strong buying sentiment prevailed. Near noon, under the competitive absorption of northern and Cantonese banks, prices rose sharply, and the market situation became chaotic. Prices rose from 3.50 million and 3.60 million to 3.80 million and 3.90 million by the noon close, approaching the 4 million mark. In the afternoon, the Central Bank refused to show weakness and offered overnight deposits to please customers, selling unlimited amounts, from 3.60 million all the way down to 3.25 million, secretly releasing around 3,000-5,000 large bars. About 10 billion in overnight funds are expected to be squeezed in this morning. Futures opened at 3.60 million and 3.80 million, falling to 3.17 million and 3.22 million, and closed at 3.20 million and 3.25 million. The overnight interest for both buyers and sellers was 3.25 million per tael, resulting in a net decrease of 50,000 compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Lin Chongyong, Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, told reporters yesterday that the gold market price showed signs of renewed activity today (the 11th). In order to stabilize gold prices, the National Bank specifically sold a total of 13,400 taels of gold in the morning and afternoon. 3,000-4,000 taels were sold in the morning. In the afternoon, hearing that the overnight gold settlement price had reached 4 million, approximately 10,000 taels were continuously sold, pushing the gold market price down to 3.25 million per tael (including the day's interest).</p>
<p>When reporters inquired about the restructuring of the gold industry market, he said he had not heard of it but believed that the financial authorities were studying the matter. Regarding the report that the Central Mint was preparing to issue Yuan Datou silver dollars for the National Bank, Lin stated that this was not the case. As for the reports of supervisory committee members visiting the National Bank for inquiries, Lin also said that he had not been contacted.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Gold jewelry prices at silver shops changed several times a day. In the morning, they were listed at 3.20 million and 3.55 million, and in the afternoon they rose to 3.30 million and 3.65 million, a further increase of 700,000 compared to the previous day. Silver jewelry rose to 30,000 and 45,000, an increase of 5,000 as well. Currency exchange dealers were very active, with same-day cash settlement. The morning rate was 3.50 million and 3.70 million, and the noon rate dropped to 3.30 million and 3.50 million, with no further changes in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, the off-exchange fluctuation of US dollars was also dramatic. The morning opening was 68,000 and 73,000. With demand exceeding supply, prices rose all the way to 78,000 and 83,000 at the noon close. Trading was thin in the afternoon. The final same-day settlement was quoted at 65,000 and 70,000, with few transactions. The overnight rate was quoted at 68,000 and 73,000. Overall, there was not much change compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Market Sentiment is Excited, Chinese Stocks All Hit Upper Limit, Afternoon Trend Weakened Before Closing</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The atmosphere of peace talks is becoming increasingly clear, the loose money market continues, and stock market sentiment is completely boiling. Both popular and unpopular stocks hit their upper limits. Wing On Textiles opened at 33 yuan. Off-exchange sellers had given up and were quietly observing. On-exchange buyers were attempting a squeeze, leading to exuberant buying sentiment and a rise to 36.5 yuan. Small investors were concerned about selling pressure and sold at higher prices, pushing the price down to 34.4 yuan. Subsequently, rumors emerged that the new financial and economic supplementary plan included the issuance of more silver dollar notes. Gold and textiles prices surged, and various groups uniformly began buying, causing a sudden and rapid change in the market trend. Prices rose all the way to the upper limit of 37.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks showed consistent strength. Mya opened at 0.94 yuan at the upper limit and remained firm at the noon close. Sun Kwong suddenly became popular near closing, reaching the upper limit of 2.59 yuan. King Fook at 1.222 yuan also hit the upper limit. Shun Ho opened at 7.5 yuan, and later rose to the upper limit of 7.92 yuan. Keen Hing at 1.73 yuan also reached the limit. Other miscellaneous stocks also hit their upper limits.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, due to continued loose funds and high opening gold prices, buying sentiment continued, and the market trend remained firm. Later, news emerged that the Central Bank was selling gold, and the tight money situation slightly shifted, causing prices to soften near closing. The total trading volume for the day was 3.16485 billion shares.</p>
<p>The gold public bonds continued to rise yesterday. The money market trended toward looser conditions, and the situation improved. The spot price of gold soared, and sentiment followed suit. Opening at 1.1 million, it rose to 1.22 million, and reached the upper limit of 1.32 million at noon. 44 taels were traded.</p>
<p>The initial bid in the afternoon was 1.32 million for buying, but because there were no sellers, no transactions occurred.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks rose sharply again yesterday. Money conditions eased, gold prices rose quickly, and buying sentiment was strong from all sides. Ewo Textiles was at 92,000 yuan and 94,000 yuan, a continued increase of 17,000 yuan. Union Insurance was at 103,000 yuan and 106,000 yuan, rising by 16,000 yuan. Ewo Brewery was at 17,500 yuan and 18,500 yuan. Jebsen &amp; Co. was at 34,000 yuan and 36,000 yuan. Asia was at 9,300 yuan and 9,500 yuan, each rising by about 10%. Wheelock Marden was bidding at 350,000 yuan, with private transactions up 90,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Trading Not Active</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] A prominent tea merchant informed reporters yesterday that, given the continuous surge in prices and the devaluation of currency, tea merchants were mostly shifting their focus to foreign exchange. As a result, the recent trend in the tea market has been weak. Prices fluctuate rapidly, but sellers, uncertain about the market, are mostly holding back, resulting in limited actual trading and mostly empty bids.</p>
<p>It was also learned that the production cost of Chinese tea is still higher than the international market price, leading to a gradual decline in exports. If tea prices continue to rise, the industry will face external strength but internal weakness. As a major export commodity, the future of tea is becoming increasingly precarious.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollars Overwhelm Gold Yuan; Market Price Grows Daily</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Since the Stock Exchange Building disallowed the use of same-day notes as collateral, silver dollar exchange transactions have been unable to operate. Recently, a new path has been developed, switching to the exchange of gold and silver without physical transfer. Transactions have been quite lively. Yesterday morning, the initial ratio of gold to silver was one tael of gold for 51 large-head silver dollars to buy and one tael of gold for 53 large-head silver dollars to sell. Near noon, the ratio went from 50, 52, and then fell to 49, 51. Small-head silver dollars initially traded at 65, 70, and then retreated to 63, 68 at noon. In the afternoon, they fell further to 60, 65. Eagle silver dollars were at 90, 95. Other ratios were 80 small-head silver dollars for 100 large-head silver dollars and 60 large-head silver dollars for 100 eagle silver dollars. Other ratios included 11 silver dollars for a 10 US dollar note.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, silver dollar arbitrage rates were as follows: Tianjin arbitrage was at 2 yuan per 100 yuan, with the physical delivery of bank drafts delayed by one day. Fuzhou arbitrage was at 3 yuan per 100 yuan. Hunan arbitrage was a 5-day term for physical delivery, with an increase of 2 yuan per 100 yuan. Wanxian arbitrage was at a premium of 5 to 10 yuan per 100 yuan. Exporters who have small discrepancies were arbitraging, with Ganzhou arbitrage offering a premium of 15 yuan per 100 yuan, and the bank drafts were delivered in physical silver seven days later.</p>
<p>Street trading was brisk due to higher prices in other areas. Supplies from all areas decreased daily, and expectations for higher prices increased. Large-head silver dollars initially traded at 62,000 and 65,000, and then rose to 66,000 and 70,000. The market situation became chaotic in the afternoon, and bids rose to 73,000 and 78,000. In the evening, as gold prices fell, they went down to 65,000 and 69,000. Small-head silver dollars were at 54,000 and 58,000. Eagle silver dollars were at 38,000 and 43,000. Transactions using bank drafts reached 75,000 and 80,000 at one point. In the afternoon, they also retreated to 70,000 and 75,000, each an increase of 5,000 compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Street silver dollar prices have been soaring in recent days. According to investigations made by our newspaper's reporters, the reasons are as follows: since last Thursday, factories have been making every effort to absorb silver dollars in preparation for mid-month payroll. Since the cash panic at the end of last month, the lack of cash funds for payroll has been the most difficult issue for factories. The tight cash situation has not eased, and mid-month is approaching rapidly. Therefore, they are initially buying silver dollars to alleviate the difficulty of payroll, which is one reason. Most industrial and commercial firms have begun distributing their profits from the first half of the year, and issuing official interest and dividends converted to silver dollars is the most convenient thing to do, which is another reason. The rise in silver dollar prices in Nanjing and Bengbu-Xuzhou areas is more pronounced than in Shanghai, especially in front-line areas such as Zhenjiang, where prices are universally higher than in Shanghai. Therefore, yesterday, individuals were carrying large amounts of cash near the North Station to purchase and transport them. In terms of yesterday's market conditions, the North was high and the South was low in the morning, and then the North was low in the afternoon, and the South was low and the North was high in the evening. This trend is greatly related to the purchases made by these individuals, which is another reason. With the issuance of silver dollar notes imminent, the general mentality is more interested in silver dollars, which is the fourth reason. The shortage of supplies from other areas and large-scale preparations, combined with arbitrage relationships, have tightened the market considerably, which is the fifth reason. Ordinary stores in this city are already engaged in the buying and selling of silver dollars and welcome bartering. The use of silver dollars is becoming increasingly common, which is the sixth reason. The silver dollar market situation has become frenzied.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices Soar Across the Board; High-End Cloth Prices End</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market experienced significant fluctuations. The credit conditions and foreign conditions were still favorable for buying. Powerful large merchants were recklessly active. Reproduction companies in the street continued their enthusiastic search. Under the cover of buying sentiment, new high prices appeared endlessly for various yarns.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix rose directly from 22 million yuan to 27 million yuan at closing, a drastic increase of 7.5 million yuan compared to the weekend. 21-count Double Horse spot initially opened at 11.5 million yuan, and after briefly declining to 10.9 million yuan, it was raised to 12.7 million yuan at the end, a surge of 3.2 million yuan. Factory orders finally closed at 10,000 yuan lower than the spot price.</p>
<p>20-count Double Horse also broke through the major mark, reaching a new high of 11.8 million yuan. 16-count yarns were traded around 10 million yuan, and other coarse and fine yarns jumped by about 30%.</p>
<p>New highs continued to appear for cotton cloth, as credit conditions in the market remained loose and prices in other areas were soaring. As a result, merchants from other areas had strong buying interest, and local merchants were also actively buying. Cloth prices opened steadily, similar to off-exchange bids from the previous day. Prices initially fell but after 9:30 am, news broke that gold prices were rising, revitalizing sentiment. The market ended at high prices.</p>
<p>Dragon Head Fine Cloth opened at 375,000 yuan and lingered for a long time. Near noon, it broke through the major mark, reaching a new peak of 430,000 yuan. The final trade was at 425,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the weekend.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Serge fell from 370,000 to 352,000 yuan, reaching a high of 400,300 yuan and finally closing at 398,000 yuan, a jump of 83,000 yuan. The after-market saw sharp rises and falls. Dragon Head Fine Cloth initially opened at 490,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge opened at 460,000 yuan. Midway through, both briefly showed leaps in price. Later, the news that peace talks were promising led to a sharp decline of 40% in Nanjing prices, causing sentiment to collapse. In the end, the former traded at 470,000 yuan and the latter at 436,000 yuan, with further price reductions after closing.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales by China Textile Construction Corporation</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Corporation continued to sell yarn on behalf of the National Bank and the US Aid Council, selling a total of 627 bales, worth 559 million yuan.

(2) 227 bales of 20-count Soaring Phoenix, etc., were offered at 8.4 million yuan each. 49 households requested 223 bales, which were allocated according to request.</p>
<p>The company also sold yarn as usual yesterday, approving 64 bales to 15 households, worth 103 million yuan.

The total amount of foreign cotton imported last year was 843,203.5 bales.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Curves Upwards; Silk Goods Rise to the Limit</h3>
<p>The initial price of superior grade raw silk opened at 20 million yuan yesterday morning. Around 10:00 am, the price fluctuated with no clear trend. After 10:00 am, due to the rise in gold and banknotes, the price rose to 21 million yuan, an increase of approximately 5 million yuan compared to the previous Saturday. However, there were few transactions, only around 10 bales.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Tianqiao and Xinghiss artificial silk opened at 11.2 million yuan for immediate delivery. Due to weak buying sentiment, the price slightly declined. The current bill initially traded at 11.4 million yuan. Later, because the National Bank did not sell gold or materials, sentiment stabilized, buying sentiment became strong again, and the price rose directly, closing at 13.8 million yuan at noon, an increase of 2.3 million yuan compared to Saturday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Huaqiang silk bedding rose to the market limit of 20% upon opening, closing at 74.16 million yuan, with continued strong buying sentiment. Off-exchange transactions rose to 84 million yuan at one point, and then fell to 8.2 million yuan as the final price. There was little other interest, and trading was scarce.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Agrees on Rayon Allocation Price</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The China Trust Bureau's rayon meeting yesterday decided on the rayon price for the fifteenth period of this year (April 11 to April 16).

<h3>Production Prices Surge, Sentiment Firm; Rice Prices Soar 30%; White Jing Rice and Bo Dao Rice Trade at 430,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw a significant rise in prices at the production area, and sentiment was extremely firm. With the continuous increase in gold and banknotes on Sunday, holders deliberately tried to catch up, aggressively raising prices at the opening. All grades of rice jumped by 30%. White Jing rice and Bo Dao rice rose to 430,000, and cash also reached 380,000 yuan. The market supply was extremely scarce, and trading was light. The situation in the North Market was similar, with a total of over 6,000 shi arriving at both markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The rising trend remained strong. Opening prices were affected by the soaring prices of various goods abroad on Sunday, and all brands of flour jumped by more than 20%. The Central Market heard that the Central Bank was selling in large quantities, and holders sold to take profits, causing the market trend to suddenly reverse. After closing, gold continued to rise, and sentiment suddenly became tense, causing the market to surge again. Old Truck brand was quoted at 145,000 yuan, and Battleship brand rose to 141,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>The market trend remained firm. Soybeans initially rose and then declined. At the opening, liquor businesses were absorbing them, and winter beans broke through the 400,000 mark. At closing, factory demand was not strong, and prices fell back to the 400,000 mark. Raw peanuts were quoted at 900,000. Red sorghum rose by more than 40,000. Corn was strongly absorbed by gangs, and the market trend rose steadily. Mung beans continued to rise, and sesame did not trade at opening.</p>

The initial price of factory soybean oil was as high as 2.4 million yuan, closing at 2.3 million yuan, a slight increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The supply of crude oil was relatively scarce, rising by 10%. Crude rapeseed oil was once as high as 2.15 million, and later retreated to the 2 million mark. Soybean cake was initially flat and then firm, with Changzi cake closing at 126,000.</p>
<h3>Rice Price Controls to Be Enforced Again</h3>
<p>Rice price controls in this city, which had been lifted for only two days, were re-implemented yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau stipulated that the wholesale price of white rice at each rice shop should be 380,000 yuan, and the retail price should be 418,000 yuan. A request has been sent to the police bureau to instruct each branch to investigate. If any rice shop violates the regulations and raises prices arbitrarily, it will be prosecuted for speculation, and its license will be revoked if the offense is serious.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices at the Four Mines Continue to Be Adjusted</h3>

<h3>Market Ramblings</h3>
<p>Discussion of Why Rent Increases Tied to the Price Index Must Be Closely Guarded</p>
<p>The Municipal Government recently held a "Temporary Municipal Affairs Meeting" with very tight security. It was thought that there were some major proposals, but it turned out that it was just to pass a method for "Rent Adjustment Based on the Price Index," and incidentally passed a resolution to "Adjust Property Taxes Based on the Price Index" as well. Afterwards, the security has still been very tight. It is said that it is to prevent social opposition, making it difficult for the Municipal Council to pass the motion. Procedurally, these types of matters do not count unless passed by the Municipal Council. Therefore, before submitting it to the Municipal Council, and before arranging it properly among the Municipal Councilors, the security must be tight!</p>
<p>It is said that the proposal to adjust rent based on the price index was a suggestion from the Municipal Affairs Office. Not long ago, when the news was spread by various newspapers, I criticized it here. However, property owners expressed dissatisfaction with the Municipal Affairs Office's proposal. They "do not oppose" adjusting rent based on the price index, but they think the base number proposed by the Municipal Affairs Office is "too low." This shows that the Municipal Affairs Office is not standing on the same side as the large landlords. Of course, the Municipal Affairs Office should stand on the same side as the majority of citizens, and should not collude with the minority of large landlords. The citizens are truly blessed. So why is the security so tight?</p>
<p>Remember since the August 13th Incident, rent has been under strict control. For more than ten years, all the authorities' controls have failed, and the only control that has been successful is rent control. If there was no such success, all citizens and the business community would be much worse off than they are now!</p>
<p>There are 5 to 6 million citizens in Shanghai, and at most 2 to 3 thousand large landlords. If rent were allowed to increase like commodity prices, many businesses would have to close down, and even more citizens would be driven to sleep under eaves and on the streets.</p>
<p>As soon as the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, large landlords took harsh measures against tenants, so the Chinese authorities and the concession authorities stepped in to control rent in order to stabilize residents. During the occupied period, the enemy and puppet authorities also valued the fact that residents must be stable, and followed the established rules. Since victory, even though the mayor has only changed twice, there have been countless activities by large landlords to lift rent controls. However, the municipal authorities all know that this is a major matter that cannot be loosened. In particular, the Municipal Council has always been able to speak out righteously on the rent issue and strike a blow. So until now, there is peace and tranquility, and all citizens and the business community are immensely blessed.</p>
<p>Now, the Municipal Affairs Office's suggestion to adjust rent based on the price index can be described as "reckless action" and "extraordinary boldness." But they also know that this is a major matter. Even though the mayor is not here, they are very energetic. I really don't know what they are up to?</p>
<p>Based on the Municipal Council's past serious attitude towards the rent issue, it is presumed that this time will be no exception and they will not act recklessly. But I don't know who will be the first to take action and fight!</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Tenants Association best represents the will of the business community and citizens of this city. For the sake of the economic and social stability of all Shanghai citizens, they have always been concerned about this issue. Now, when everyone is struggling to survive, their burden is being increased. What is their intention? It's really hard to imagine!</p>
<p>All Citizens Are Struggling to Survive, Hoping Councilors Will Speak Out Righteously</p>

<h3>Ping Pong Opening Postponed Due to Overwhelming Crowds</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The 4th Ping Pong League was originally scheduled to open last night at the Jinmen Ping Pong Room on Fujian South Road, with a marquee match between top-tier teams Huamei and Quanlu. More than 2,000 ping pong fans arrived, filling the room to capacity, making it impossible to hold the match. The committee had to announce that the match would be rescheduled. The enthusiasm for ping pong in this city is unprecedented. The Jinmen Ping Pong Room offered its venue for free, but chairs and tables were damaged, for which the committee expressed its apologies. Tonight, there will be six B-group matches held at various locations, with the schedule as follows:</p>
<p>Shanbao - Erhua (B1) 7:00 PM Shanbao</p>
<p>Shuping - Jianxin (B1) 7:00 PM Jingzong</p>
<p>Yongwu - Lulian (B1) 8:30 PM Jingzong</p>
<p>Tianxiang - You 18 (B2) 7:00 PM You 10004</p>
<p>Tiemao - Xinyi (B2) 7:00 PM Xinyi</p>
<p>Chouhong - Jingwei (B2) 7:00 PM Chouye</p>
<h3>Ping Pong World: Players and Events</h3>
<p>Renowned ping pong referee Chen Jimao suddenly suffered from chronic enteritis a month ago. He was treated at the Municipal Fifth Hospital. With the careful treatment of the hospital's doctors, he is recovering and good fortune has befallen him. He has made many contributions to the league and is a member of this year's committee.</p>
<p>Jiang Zongdi, a veteran player from the "Evening Glow Team" in Suzhou, represented the Qibu team against the Jewish Allied Forces 7 or 8 years ago, innovatively using hard balls in ping pong matches to achieve victory. Jiang, nicknamed "Soy Sauce Radish," joined the China Agricultural Machinery Company last year, and formed the Zhongnong Ping Pong Team to join the workers' cup competition, ranking third in the division. Apart from Zongdi, all the team members are newcomers. This result is not weak. This time, they signed up for the B-group league to compete for the championship. Because the China Agricultural Bank had already registered a team named Zhongnong, to avoid duplicate names, they decided to change the name to "Agricultural Machinery." Jiang will serve as the team captain.</p>
<p>Fan Liangji and Lu Yongkang, current members of the Quanlu team, have both played for the Jinlong and Lianxing teams, and can be called like-minded friends. Not long ago, the two married a pair of Wang sisters on the same day and at the same time at the Dali Restaurant. From then on, Fan and Lu went from being friends to brothers-in-law, which can be said to be a blessing!</p>
<p>Chen Enrong is a talented player on the Huayan volleyball team. This time, Chen used his qualifications as captain of the Nongji B-team to form a team to participate in this year's league. However, all the registration procedures were handled by his wife, Hu Jiahe. Jiahe was one of the five leading players of the Girls' Qing Ping Pong Team eight years ago. She was skilled in cutting and achieved great success. She is now a good wife and mother, and has long given up this sport. People like them can be called a "blessed couple."</p>
<p>Qian Guanqin, the captain of the Youth Team, which was last year's B-group champion, said that since last winter, the team has lacked someone responsible for team affairs, and the team members have scattered, effectively halting operations. As a result, it is difficult to revive the team and continue to join this year's league. Qian himself has also lost the opportunity to participate in the competition, and he has feelings of sadness!</p>

<h3>Sports World: Hua Lian Completes Hegemony, Defeats Encas in Final Battle, Takes Home the Championship</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The basketball league's A Group completed its schedule last night. In the final game, champion Hua Lian team narrowly defeated Encas by three points. Hua Lian led by as many as twelve points in the first half, 27-15, and the final score was 42-39. There was an interlude before the game: the referees' Old Boys team defeated the Basketball Committee, 47-43. Before the start of the A Group games, an award ceremony was held. Hua Lian team won four consecutive championships. Shao Rugan, a staff member of the Sports Association, presented the award, and Ren Xiangcheng, the captain of the Hua Lian team, accepted the championship trophy. The ceremony was completed amidst applause. The audience in the gymnasium was enthusiastic last night, declaring a full house, with an estimated 2,000-3,000 people.</p>
<p>After the award ceremony, the Hua Lian-Encas battle began. Both sides guarded closely, making scoring difficult. Encas took an early lead of 4-0, but Hua Lian caught up to tie the score at 5-5. The score then fluctuated between the two sides, making it difficult to tell who would win. After ten minutes, the score was tied at 11-11. Afterwards, Liu Fushan and Da Li's skillful shots suddenly allowed Hua Lian to gradually gain the upper hand. At the end of the first half, Encas was trailing by as many as twelve points. In the second half, Da Li felt unwell and was replaced by Le Jiazhou. Hua Lian continued to lead all the way, but the gap between the two sides gradually narrowed. In the last ten minutes, the difference was only six points. Liu Fushan fouled out after committing his fifth foul, and Zhang Liangxiong came on, making the situation even more critical. At this time, the score was 39-35. Then, Bo Tou and Que Li scored two consecutive baskets, bringing Encas to within two points of Hua Lian at 41-39. At this time, there were still two and a half minutes left in the game. Although Hua Lian used the "Mahjong" tactic to try to delay the time, Hua Lian scored one more point in the last ten seconds, sealing the victory at 42-39. Hua Lian defeated Encas again to complete its hegemony.</p>
<p>Liu Fushan's performance last night was outstanding, with skillful shots one after another, as if divinely aided, making him a major contributor. Li Zhenzhong was the central soul of the whole team, but his retirement in the second half created such a dangerous situation, otherwise it would never have come to this. Bao Songyuan also played well, but Wu Chengzhang had no room to develop. Encas missed many shots last night, which was also a matter of luck.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Technique</h3>
<p>— Translated and Described by Qi Gong</p>
<p>(II) Dead ball.</p>
<p>(A) After failing to intercept the ball of the receiver, when he is about to catch the ball, the players of this team should try to move forward to prevent him from passing the ball out, and must hold the ball tightly to become a dead ball. After the dead ball, a jump ball must be held, and both sides have an equal opportunity to get the ball.</p>
<p>(B) Players must be proficient in jumping high enough, jumping straight up, using their fingertips to push the ball higher and forward into the hands of the intended receiver, and it is best to signal with a secret sign before the jump ball.</p>
<p>(I) In order to avoid being closely marked, the forward must jump high and use his fingertips to push the ball to the open space near the basket before the rebound comes back, so that the receiver can immediately shoot after receiving the ball.</p>
<p>(II) The guard should jump high and use his fingertips to push the ball away from the important area under the basket when grabbing the ball under the basket, and it is most suitable to push the ball to the sideline. After the dead ball, when both sides jump the ball, a guard should be left in the position before the basket to ensure safety.</p>
<p>(III) Interception Midway.</p>
<p>(A) Players must have a sense of premonition and be able to quickly change their steps and directions, and they must also coordinate in time to be able to intercept the opponent's pass midway.</p>
<p>(B) With proficient basic skills, the body is flexible and controlled, and the chance of fouling is reduced.</p>
<p>(C) Players must see clearly that they are sure of interception before attempting to intercept, or at least obstruct the opponent's passing, so that the pass is skewed and loses its accuracy.</p>
<p>(D) Application of secret sign gestures.</p>
<p>(I) Players should have the need to use secret sign gestures in the following situations.</p>
<p>(A) When both sides jump the ball in the center circle.</p>
<p>(B) When throwing the boundary ball.</p>
<p>(C) When a jump ball is held after a dead ball.</p>
<p>(D) When taking a fixed formation.</p>
<p>(II) The secret signs and gestures are classified as follows.</p>
<p>(A) Verbal secret signs, (I) shouting out numbers, secret signs, or terms.</p>
<p>(B) Issuing gestures so that teammates can perform actions by seeing the gestures.</p>
<p>(I) Raising a finger to signal, (II) shaking the hand, arm, or foot to signal, (III) signaling the direction the center is running towards the center circle.</p>
<p>(III) In order to save time, the center forward can issue secret signs and gestures to signal to the other two forwards at the same time when he enters the center circle before receiving the ball and launching the offensive, and the other two forwards should immediately prepare to implement the planned strategy when the referee passes the ball to the center forward.</p>
<p>Forward group offensive techniques.</p>
<p>(A) Guiding various offensive methods.</p>
<p>(I) Implementing a fast attack method. (A) To deal with the area defense system, try to induce the guards to move away from their positions. (B) To deal with the man-to-man defense system, you must avoid the guards and rush into the basket. (C) To deal with various defensive methods, you must be able to seize the opportunity, and if you encounter a situation where no one is guarding a certain area of the defensive formation and there is an opportunity to take advantage of it, you must immediately seize this opportunity and attack that area.</p>
<p>(II) Implementing smoke screen tactics. (A) Use legal blocking techniques to cover other attackers to get rid of the watchers and rush into the basket. (II) Use smoke screen blocking techniques to hinder the opponent's guards from receiving the ball. (III) You can launch an offensive by using a smoke screen when launching the ball from the center circle into the opponent's court.</p>
<p>(A) When the center is preparing to pass the ball into the opponent's court in the center circle or when the other forward is throwing the ball into the court on the mid-line, you can use a smoke screen to cover. (B) When the center passes the ball out in the center circle, the other two forwards look clearly at the secret signs or gestures issued by the center to move. (C) Make sure the forwards do not stand still on the mid-line waiting to receive the ball. (D) If the center is closely marked by the guards, the other two forwards should move forward to meet the ball passed out by the guards in this court. (To be continued D)</p>
<p>One player jumps high and passes quickly, and the other player stretches out his hand to make a false action.</p>

<h3>Regarding Expanding Grain Storage</h3>
<p>— Lei Ting</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities are once again clamoring for expanding grain storage.</p>
<p>Based on the ancient teaching of "be prepared for unforeseen circumstances," coupled with the current experience of soaring rice prices, the idea of "storing" grain has become common knowledge for every citizen. And now this common knowledge has long been widely ingrained among the people, so it seems unnecessary for the authorities to "expand" the propaganda.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there is any criticism of the grain storage methods, nor is it to oppose the expansion movement, but to honestly say: because the people regard "food" as heaven, and because of the hardships of life in recent years, everyone already understands the value of materials and paper money, and there will never be an idiot who saves paper money. Therefore, if the performance of "storage" is not enough, it is only a matter of "strength."</p>
<p>I remember not long ago, the authorities also reminded us: each household should prepare three months' worth of food storage. This warning was absolutely well-intentioned, and it was also telling citizens to "be prepared for unforeseen circumstances," just as this expansion of grain storage is absolutely well-intentioned. However, what was the result? I dare not say. Because among the more than five million citizens, those who can prepare three months' worth of food storage in one go probably account for only a very small fraction of a small number, and the benefits are naturally very few. On the contrary, the general propertied class, given this reminder, became even more alert, believing that there was a problem with rice, and therefore stored a lot. Even worse, they shifted their attention to other daily necessities and stockpiled them in the same way. With competitive buying, the grain that the authorities pointed out should be stored, as well as other daily necessities that were not pointed out, took the opportunity to rise sharply, so that the small people, who could originally store grain for three days, had it cut in half, and even could not store grain for one day.</p>
<p>In today's social and economic situation, the majority of citizens have already fallen into the small people class. Doing a day's work and buying a day's food is the living situation of the general laboring class; doing a month's work, and at the end of the month when the salary is received, being able to buy how many days' worth of grain for the next month is still a mystery, which is the living situation of the general salaried class.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the majority of citizens have the heart but not the strength, so the effect of this expanded grain storage is naturally obvious.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing this article, rice prices are said to have exceeded the 300,000 mark, and I hope that tomorrow it will not create any records because of the advocacy of expanding grain storage. If the benefits of grain storage are there but not here, then the small people who do not have the power to "store" will really have no food to eat.</p>
<h3>Examination of Surname Character Decomposition</h3>
<p>— Jin Yuan</p>
<p>Nowadays, when ordinary people exchange names, they often use character decomposition to describe the surname, such as walking Xiao Zhao, mouth sky Wu, bow long Zhang, etc. Although these are vulgar and do not conform to the six scripts, examining their origin, they do indeed have a long history. I will try to record what I have seen and correct the learned.</p>
<p>The Biography of Kong Rong in the Book of the Later Han says: "Why must the one who has the world have a Mao Jin knife?" This Mao Jin knife is the origin of Liu. Also, the Biography of Dong Zhuo says: "At the beginning of Emperor Xian's reign, the nursery rhyme in the capital said: A thousand miles of grass, how green, ten days to divine, cannot live." This thousand miles of grass is the origin of Dong. The Outer Biography of the Book of Yuejue says: "The text belongs to Ding, from Yu Bangxian, takes the mouth as the surname, and inherits it with the sky"; Guo Zhongshu's Pei Zhai cited the National History, saying: "The mouth in the sky is Wu," this mouth sky is the origin of Wu. Wen Daya's Great Tang Founding Living Notes cited the Buddhist nun Huihua's poem, saying: "Eighteen sons in the East China Sea, enter the well and call the three armies, holding double white birds in their hands, wearing purple clouds on their heads"; this eighteen sons is the origin of Li. Hong Mai's Kezhai Three Notes says: "Mu Yi has already been an official in the Ministry of Works, and bow long has worked as an editor"; this Mu Yi is Yang, and bow long is the origin of Zhang. From this, we can see that worldly customs and sayings all have origins, and are not all fabricated.</p>
<h3>Two Chapters on Singing Falling Flowers</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Using the original rhyme of the late Mr. Xu Xiaoyun of Shanyin and his son Mr. Jun, Lianju</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>The crimson dye covers the ground, the horse's hooves solidify (Huo), looking back, the road wants to get lost. The catkins gather and disperse with the smoke from far and near (Zhi), the branches of short and long remain green at different heights. Do not say that the tide is unfaithful if it comes late (Huo), all get up late because the island does not crow. Zhu will eventually ride the wind and return (Zhi), do you remember in the previous life that you were spring mud? ( )</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The shade of the corner courtyard ends this life (Zhi), who will remember the year on the spiritual monument. The shark pearls have been cried out and are difficult to form tears (Huo), and the silkworm silk is mostly not tied to spring. It is vain to say that the magical formula can retain the scenery (Zhi), and it is unbearable to see that dust has already grown on the dressing case. Singing the song of red bean Acacia is exhausted (Huo), it is difficult to find a confidant in the south.</p>
<h3>Outside Notes on Watching a Play</h3>
<p>— Tan Ke</p>
<p>March 29th, on leave. This is such a rare day off other than Sunday! The Lanyin Theater is staging the three-act comedy "Setting an Example." My chest, which has been stifled for a long time, should be relaxed a bit, so I invited a partner to watch "Setting an Example."</p>
<p>In order to save a bit of fare, walking was too time-consuming, so I decided to ride a bicycle. Although the bike wasn't very "stylish," it was stable and fast gliding on the Boluo Road. Lanyin was in sight in less than ten minutes. When I got to Lanyin, I rushed to buy tickets. There were no empty seats in the front row, so I had to buy tickets for the back row. Fortunately, the Lanyin Theater wasn't very big, and the back row was quite good, and it was still a balcony seat!</p>
<p>After buying the tickets, I thought about the problem of where to put the bike. S, who went with me, suggested storing it at a friend's house. However, the friend's house was quite a long way from Lanyin. It would be easy to ride there now, but we would have to walk to get the bike after the show, and everyone felt a little unmotivated. So we turned the bike around and stopped in front of Lanyin again, thinking about locking it nearby to a tree or telephone pole on the sidewalk. I thought it would be okay to just hand it over to the "bike parking station" in front of Lanyin, and pay a few bucks. There was unanimous agreement. S locked the bike, and I asked the price. There were two people to "come and negotiate," one was a middle-aged man, in his thirties or forties, wearing short clothes; the other was a woman in her forties or fifties, wearing a cheongsam.</p>
<p>But the answer after asking the price was a simple sentence:</p>
<p>"Four hundred yuan per bike!" One---is called bargaining.</p>
<p>"Is two hundred yuan okay?"---This is haggling.</p>
<p>"Three hundred yuan, according to yesterday's price, can't push it down any further!"---This is, of course, a concession.</p>
<p>However, S seemed impatient:</p>
<p>"It only costs a thousand yuan a month to park a bike at the school, let's lock it somewhere else!" He opened the chain of the already locked bike again.</p>
<p>After locking the bike, it was time to rush in and take our seats. I was very uneasy, but there was nothing I could do: would the bike be hidden or would some parts be taken off? ---No, that must be overthinking.</p>
<p>The play on stage came to an end, and S left his seat, saying that he was going to take a look at the bike. It turned out that he was also a little uneasy. S's report back was:</p>
<p>"Looking down from the window, the bike is leaning quietly against the tree, safe and sound." So everyone was happy.</p>
<p>At 4:45, the play ended. The bike was still leaning quietly against the tree, but the bell on it had been removed and the rear tire had been deflated.</p>
<p>As for that "bike parking station"? There was no way to find it, and no need to find it.</p>
<h3>Panorama of the Universe</h3>
<p>— Cang Yi</p>
<p>The natives of the Transvaal region of South Africa regard wives and concubines as their main property. The more wives a person has, the richer his property is. If they encounter financial difficulties, they can transfer them to others, and they can still make up for it if they have money. The selling price of wives and concubines ranges from two to sixteen pounds.</p>
<p>Greece reformed its currency four years ago, with a ratio of 50 billion to one; Hungary also reformed its currency three years ago, with a ratio of 4 followed by twenty-nine zeros to one.</p>
<p>There is an unmarried female monkey in the Campbell Circus in the United States who has her own savings in the bank. All deposit and withdrawal procedures are based on her "hand" print as proof. It is said that the amount of her savings is very considerable.</p>
<h3>"The More the Cheaper"</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>A good play should not be sung twice.</p>
<p>Even if the music is as beautiful as "The Blue Danube," if you listen to it more than a dozen times, it will make people feel that "the Danube has flooded."</p>
<p>In particular, banknotes should not be printed too much, because if they are printed too much, it will be too late to print later.</p>
<p>Even the most beautiful "slogan" is best shouted sparingly. When it is shouted out for the first time, it is extremely beautiful. Afterwards, when everyone follows along, it feels vulgar and harsh.</p>
<p>Therefore, Maupassant said: "The first person to compare a woman to a flower is a genius, the second person to compare a woman to a flower is a mediocre person, and the third person to compare a woman to a flower is a stupid person!"</p>
<p>If humans had never used animals as food, then today, if someone were found dissecting the bodies of pigs and sheep, it would be a shocking "dismemberment case."</p>
<p>The problem with society lies in "familiarity"!</p>
<p>If the production of gold were also as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, then the name of gold would definitely be set as "yellow sand."</p>
<p>It is not advisable to read too many books, and it is not advisable to understand too much about worldly affairs. Otherwise, you will feel that everything is "unreasonable." Even enthusiastic and impassioned articles will feel boring when read.</p>
<p>"The more the cheaper," nothing is outside of this.</p>
