<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕與中共之和平商談，顯已為目前政府與人民一致最迫切之問題。新閣宣告組成後，自代總統以至何應欽院長，廿二日均忙於籌備工作。據悉：如訊速進行，代表團可望於四月初赴平。某權威人士稱：此次代表團負實商談，其情況有如卅四年雙十會談之情形，由國共雙方互派代表，首先商討最原則之問題，並決定內戰事宜，然後召開新政協，並邀第三方面人士參加，共同商討和平後之一切政治問題。政府代表啣命赴平，將不以全櫂代表之資格出席，卽當每一問題討論至最後階段時，保留簽字權，在平向南京諸示後決定，如此辦法，對代表及政府均有裨益。至此次赴平商談之根據原則，則為以毛澤東八項條件為基礎之十人委會所擬就之和平鋼領。惟目前和平綱領尚係初稿，有待修正改善。某權威人士對此養表杞憂，因某某等主戰份士，認為以八項條件為基礎一點，不能同意，果如是，則將來和談前途暗礁必多。又記者與某權威人士談及廢除憲法法統問題時，彼稱：最合理之辦法，卽在將來新政協召開後，另行成立一機構，以召開新的國民大會，從事新憲法之修訂。某氏對整編軍隊一點，表示意見稱：吾人究願採取瀋陽·長春·天津各地之軍隊改編式，抑願採取北平之軍隊整編式，何況全面和平之商談，必優於北平傳軍之整編也。又某氏復評論常前局勢稱：若千主戰份子，顯非認為自己實力足以擊潰對方而主戰，打不下去乃是事實，故應立卽開始商談和平。某氏尤稱：當前之和談，政府方面顯然必須有所讓步，蓋中共當局之條件甚顯明，中共乃在期待政府之求和，故將來商談時，必有若干問題，為政府人士認為不當，但和談勢在必行，為一事實，和談之前途黯淡，亦不可諱言之後果。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕立院廿二日下午通過決議，促請政府電促中共速派代表，指定地點，開始和談。該案係由楊不平等廿一人，以臨時緊急動議提出，全塲無反對者，該案附列辦法二項，一為政府應從速充窗和談代表，一為政府立電中共派出代表，指定地點，開始和談。有人謂：「充實和談代表」之充實二字欠妥，當經主席宣布該案無異議通過，推定委員五人連同原提案人負責整理文字，提下次院會報告。</p>

<p>〔中央社莫斯科廿二日電〕記者頃訪傳秉常大使，渠謂：此次受任外長，本人事前毫無所悉，迨本晨接獲新行政院長何應欽通知後，方知此事。渠對此新職正加考慮，接受與否猶未決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕前駐蘇大使邵力子，廿二日就傅秉常出任外長一事對記者談稱：傳氏駐蘇五六年之久，對蘇聨政情及蘇對華態度已極熟悉，傳氏出任外長，必能使我對美。蘇兩國之外交政策求得均衡。關於傳氏返國後其遺缺有邵氏繼任之說，記者以此詢問邵氏，據稱：當局並未向本人談及此事，惟前曾有人向本人提及，木人在國策決定前，不願考慮。邵氏此語，乃表示如國策為反蘇者，渠不擬考慮此事，如國策變更為美。蘇並重者，邵氏當可研究。又何院長已於廿一日致電傅秉常，促卽返國就職，館務則暫由大使館參事代辦，傳返國期可能為一週後，至遲為半個月。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社漢口廿二日電〕國民政府之前途，其命運之定奪，目前似在將其最優良之軍隊，在白祟禧將軍指揮下集中於武漢區。白將軍將其軍隊堅守於長江及粵漢鐵路之交叉點上，在靜待共軍之進步，抑召開和談。據觀察家稱：渠極願和談之能開成，因其實力雖不足以使其獲得決定勝利，然卻使渠能在和談中占有重要地位，渠似已將其軍隊部署就緒，而在其權力所及各省，亦能指揮若定。廣西主要將領，皆在其指揮之下，舉例言之，張淦指揮軍事焦武漢之北，夏威坐鎮安慶，張軫指揮豫南軍事。白崇禧將各軍，在二月中經過調整後，似已能將其地位大為鞏固。據軍事專家稱：白崇禧將軍之軍隊，約有十五萬地方部隊，十五萬國軍，分佈於沿長江之七百公里地帶，及控制二百五十公里之平漢鐵路。國軍中尤其係最精銳之桂軍，裝備頗良，其中並有數師係完全摩托化及以美國器材配備者。漢口軍界人士認為雖則林彪之共軍出現於徐州以南一帶，然認為共軍總攻恐尚暫不可能，雖則消滅白氏所指揮之一軍隊，為國軍之一大損失，然同時對共黨代價亦必甚鉅。共軍迄今為止，祗在武漢下遊一帶進行小規模之偵察戰。聞共軍一縱隊開赴距漢口東六十公里之麻城，據軍方消息稱，其自的僅在偵察鄂北沿江地區。其他在豫南之大部份中共正規軍廿萬人則正與白崇禧之軍隊相持未有何動作。平漢鐵路東一帶，雖有戰爭，然商業並未停頓。在一九四八年之時，八千萬磅之煙葉仍自豫省共區輸鄂交換農業品，據最近消息，物物交換們在雙方將領許可之下在進行中。</p>

<p>舉國疆望的何內稅，經過一星期的籌組之後，已於廿一日呱呱墮地了，八部一會的首長曁七位政務委員，也已由李代總統任命發表。看何內閣的陣容，似乎有顯著的進步，目有一番新氣象，自然增加全國人民對於何內閣的期也難怪。據本報南京訊，何內閣定於日內舉行首次政務合議，討論新內閣的施政方針，聞其要點，乃在切實推行下列四項目標：（一）謀取和古；（二）政治革新：（三）穏定經濟；（四）安定民生。</p>
<p>這四項施政方針，就字面看，正是人民對於政府　所迫切期待的。在今日低沉的政氛之下，旋政主針實在不需要高談闊論，與其好高驚遠，雨得天花亂壓，開出的支票不能兌現，徒使人民朱望，母寗實事求是，老老實實地說，切切實實地幹。「精神所至，金石為開」，只要有誠心和毅力，任何困難難都不悉不能克服。姑以此四項施政方針而言，謀和與革新，一報已一再論列，本文不欲有所增益，而對於穏定經濟與安定民生兩項，我們不能不指出這是何院長的着眼獨到之處。</p>
<p>在何院長奉命組閣之初，早就有取法英國工黨內閣所推行的社會政策之意，因為何院長在抗發勝利之後，曾奉命出國參加聨合國參謀會議，對於英美的民主制度與社會政策，當有深刻的認識，此鄱同任行政院長，自必能推行民生主義的經濟政策，以償其宿願·同時，我們還要指出，今日的中國人民，因受通貨彭脹的影響，莫不生活在水深火熬之中，一旦廳到何院長的施政方針要穏定經濟和安定民生，無異廳到了福音，誰不歡呼雀　？今後的問題，就在如何實現這個穏定與安定耳。</p>
<p>我們站在人民的立塲，對於何內閣的新財經政策，實在不能不特別重視。在目前的情形之下，不論是國家的財政，或是個人的經濟，幾乎都已山窮水盡，但也未始沒有柳暗花明的新境界。近來這兩個月，物價固然步漲，但假使沒有前任財長徐堪毅然拿出他的一套辦法來應急，恐怕今天還不能有這樣古靜。聽說新任財長劉攻芸就職以後，將對現行辦漢再作一番補偏救弊偏救弊的損益工作，另定一套辦法出來，自然我們希望辦法愈變愈好，可以使人們人民的生活鬆一口氣。就新內閣的人才來說，劉財長就是現任的中央銀行總裁，也可以說現任的事實上的財長。目前的財政，似乎除了拋金漲，買賣外匯證，和大量印鈔而外，還未見有新措施，則可見財政之實權乃操於中央銀行之手。故劉財長的財政政策，戒者不會有八九十度的大轉灣。至於經濟部長孫越崎，也是原來資源委員支委員長，當然有舊章可循。在張嘉　翁文灝兩氏推荐聲中，劉孫兩長上臺，自當展布其新猷，以慰人民之喁望。</p>
<p>或者以為現行財經政策將有生在的改變。「窮則變」，固然是一個好現象，但最主要的，卻要「變則通」，不可變而更糟。保院長自滬抵京時曾賂記者稱：「本人對於經濟政策猶如一張白紙」，這固然能雨明何院長虛懷若谷的風度，但也足以顯示現何院長對於當前的經濟危機，尚有待專家去研究起草一套完善的辦法。我們今天還不知道新內閣的辦法如何，但有一句總話，挽架經濟危機之道，除了注意枝枝節節的支衞問題而外，最重要的必須確立「使豪富出錢」的大方針，若不能取之於豪富，用之於平民，則不但「經濟平等」談不到，「經濟社會化」的目標達不到，即目前國庫收支亦必不數之數晶鉅，而地以挽救當前的經濟危機，更無以收拾失動漫的人心。全國人民期待何內閣用新人行新政者，首在這一點。所以新獻財經方案如何，不但可以看出何內閣的施政方針是是滯向着改善民生的目標做去，而且何內閣的素質也可以從這裏窺見一斑。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕廿二日晨九時，空軍偵察機再度前往葫蘆島上空偵察重慶號覺艦情形，該機駕駛員胡萃庭，此次憶為第三次飛臨葫蘆島。據其所見，覺艦的艦底更翻得利害，油庫起火部份，燒了二天二夜，加以海水浸入，火滅煙消，葫蘆島亦安靜異常。胡君談及十八·十九日飛臨葫蘆島該艦上空時，當時遙見艦上電光一閃一閃（是高射砲火猛烈發射的砲口火光），天空佈滿瀑炸的砲彈，島雲一球一示，那眞是緊張的戰爭景象。廿日機隊第三度往炸時，該艦卽無砲火反應，卽　葫藍島陸上五門高射砲也撤退走了，蓋恐遭殃及也·胡君原欲偕其夫人高雪梅往觀「雪裏紅」影片，因與記者談了葫蘆島的情形而錯過了這塲戲。</p>
<p>〔本報青島廿二日電〕代軍第八大隊憶於廿一日晨，由陳司令嘉尚率領返京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕軍界人士緬對重慶號之役，加以評論云：重慶號之役，雨明海軍艦集無飛機保護，一旦遭遇空製，必然走向毀滅之途。此次共方倘有戰鬥機，必加使用，以阻撫國軍轟炸機羣之接基尼　，正以共軍缺乏空軍，重慶號之轟炸，仍成色單純之轟炸技術精確與否之考騐。亦因共軍之無空軍，前往轟炸之飛機，乃得於編隊飛往葫蘆島上空後從空單機進入投彈。更因轟炸技術精到，及所用炸彈每彈造成卅英尺直經彈穴，所予艦面之侵害太巨（重慶號艦面僅寬五十一英尺），故重慶號中彈中彈後起火爆炸，傾側翻轉，嗣後趨於覺沒，亦為必然途徑。但以一般對空軍作用不甚了了解，致重慶號被炸後，一般后應均覺警異·實則明瞭空軍威力者，固遭料及重慶號郵走後，必然有此平凡之結局。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕滬西謹記路發現被支解男屍之大血案後，昨常熟路警分局長程義寬，竟日親率刑事股長陳鳳麟，及各幹練警員，分赴現塲及有關各處進行偵查，聞已獲得極重要之綫索多種。據一般觀察：該案兇手對屍體之處置，雖較北站箱屍案尤為殘酷，但依犯罪學學理研究結果，犯罪方式亦常有摹仿作用在內。該案凶手行凶时，現已經認定與棄屍時相距不久，，則箱屍案於其兩週前發生，凶手支解屍體之動機可能係受此種影響所致。且根據現塲種種跡象推測，該案行凶之主犯或從犯，對醫學，解剖學，以及屠宰方法，至少非絕無經騐之人。否則以刀斧切斷骨肉，決不能如此整齊光潔，而顯然能遵循解剖人類或獸類骨體結構之法則。再以藏屍包裹內之報紙一張，及壑屍女襖內之紙條，尤足證凶手係屬一智識份子，至少曾受相當敎育。紙條上之「人之有仇與我，可忘而不可念」，揆度語氣，在似通非通之間，可能係故意出此。同時全部字句以六號鉛字印成，而並非親筆留書，更充分說明凶犯於事前曾運用智慧，熟慮利害，精密策劃，在不留痕跡之原則下，佈置乃極臻妥密。根據以上各方面之論斷，主要綫索已大致出現，加以目前主持偵查之程義寬氏，係我國前派往美國聯邦偵查局研究犯罪及偵查之著名學者，並為我國現在弟一流犯罪學專家，在渠担任經警大隊長時代，曾迭破鉅案，各方咸信其必能以熟練之科學方法，對此「包屍」案能尅日破獲云。</p>
<p>黃包裹行李袋斷非本地產物</p>
<p>〔又訊〕關於此一殘酷之兇殺案，迄昨日止，表面上雖尙無顯著發展，但根據屍體之檢騐，除年齡身長外，聞已能確定死者為北方籍。同時盛屍之黃包裏及行李袋，經研究後，亦斷決非本地所產，極可能來自北方。故本案兇手可能故佈疑陣，在外埠將死者支解後，移運來滬者。另一推測，則為兇手先將死者設計誘至本市僻靜地區，加害後再予支解，然後乘夜深人靜之際，移屍謹記路。因此警局方面，昨日除向路局請求動員路警及員工協助追查此二日來有否在客車上携帶類似黃包裹行李袋之旅客外，並向本市人力車，三輪車，出租汽車公會調查可能破案之綫索。</p>
<p>常熟警察分局在轄區查戶口</p>
<p>此外昨夜常熟警分局在其轄區內動員全體員警嚴密調查戶口，蓋局方認為整屍之女襖及小孩開襠褲，定與案情有關。總之，警局鑒於本市毀屍滅跡案件，層出不窮，故亦集中人力物力決心摘奸發伏，預期本案短期內不難水落石出。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌十九日訊〕「田園寥落干戈後骨肉流離道路中」。—白居易的這兩句詩，彷彿是在現在流落在後方的戰土家屬的　眞寫照，因為這裏面繪出了她們所處的苦境。自從徐蚌大戰以來，從濟南·徐州·蚌埠等前綫遷移到南昌來的職士家屬，據聯勤部南昌過境軍眷接應站的統計，在萬人以上。依照接應站的規定，凡是過境的軍眷，可以在站上登記，由他們照顧免費在南昌指定的旅館休息三天，再行西去，或個別擇居，所以在接應站看到從戰地來的軍屬，都是那末來去匆匆的。</p>
<p>但是，在這批疏散的軍眷中，有一批無家可歸或是與她的丈夫暫時失去聯絡或是他的丈夫在戰地陣亡的太太，公子，以至白髮皺臉的老太爺，………現在却流落在洪都故城。</p>
<p>這羣前途茫茫的軍眷隊伍中，共有五十多人，係從山西·山東·開封和徐·蚌·而來，除了二位「校官夫人」外，其餘都是下級幹部的太太，他們扶老携幼，走遍了江南平原，來到洪都，當她們回憶在開封·濟南等地和家人團聚，衣食飽暖的生活，不禁嘆惜戰爭的殘酷和「來日茫茫愁似海」的生計。</p>
<p>地板當床舖</p>
<p>現在，她們住在江西大旅社三樓和四樓的房間裏因為是流落的眷屬，付不起昂貴的房價，一切的茶水操作，自然不可能與尊貴的旅客，得到同樣的享受。十幾個人擠在一間一丈見方的小房間裏，破爛的地板，當了他們的床鋪。沒有玻璃的窗戶，正好呌陽光透進來，溫暖戰士家眷破碎了的心。房子裏安頓了些破爛的行裝與孩子們啼飢號寒的哭聲，相映成一幅流民岡。</p>
<p>丈夫在前方</p>
<p>在這離亂的生活中，她們會想家嗎？曾想自己在前方的丈夫嗎？從她們每一張憔悴的面孔上，從她們吶吶不休對孩子們加以安慰的口氣中，不但是望穿秋波似的刻骨地想念，連夜眠做夢時也會看到自己的丈夫回來的吧。一位在開封前方作戰的排長太太談：當開封失守的前夕，丈夫將她送到城裏來，第二天，這座汴染古城便為共軍佔領，逃到南京，又逢政府疏散，再到南昌來，關於她丈夫的消息，經過了千方百計的打聽，最近才聽到一位排上的弟兄回來說：她的丈夫在開封戰塲上犧牲了，同樣的，別的三位太太也得到了這類的噩耗。但是，她們從絕望中，依然在祈禱，在想念，渴望着自己的丈夫會有萬一機會生還，重溫好夢。黃伯韜兵團的一位連長，最近自戰地逃到南京，得到朋友的消息，知道自己的妻子逃到南昌，當他來到洪都，和家人團聚時，他的太太等於做了一塲夢。在這幕悲劇改演成喜劇時，有許多太太欣慰得掉下眼淚。</p>
<p>生計成問題</p>
<p>接應站的先生們，對道批軍眷特別優待，首先將暫住三天的規定，作為例外，並且替她們解決疾病，醫藥，以及一日二餐菜蔬柴炭等問題，但是，在這米珠薪挂的今朝，以這一些從各方面勸募而來的錢，長期支持這批苦難太太的生活，實非易事！今後怎樣安頓她們的生活，却成為了不能久恃而亟需解決的問題了。</p>

<p>〔本報鎭江廿日訊〕鎭江江面自封鎖以後，時間還沒有多久，人的偷渡，貨的走私，就鬧得三山都不寗靜。連日除將偷渡者嚴予緝辦外，十七日丹徒江面又發生一大批貨船走私，詳情如下：</p>
<p>有「時泰」「利羣」輪船兩艘，拖載有中型木船九隻，載有猪·酒·棉子等大批貨物，從江北偷運南來，路經丹徒江面，被駐軍發覺，當卽禁扣江中，電請核辦，據調查結果，輪船兩艘，木船九隻，是口岸區長梁啓民負責向協興勝成兩公司所僱用，木船三隻裝猪，二隻裝酒，四只裝棉子，由商人孟繼坤押運，於本月十一日夜間，卽由龍窩口啓行，目的地係運達鎭江，李日東是鎭江方面接貨代表人，十一隻船上有人七十餘名，除「時泰」「利羣」輪船船主李長明·楊唐雲及各木船東夥外，其餘乘客身份多有不明，內有國防部軍人陳質民·顧正榮均配有證件，其他商民之身份證多已失時效者。</p>
<p>據該船負責貨運者語記者：此係一大規模之走私集團，計劃非常週密，曾不惜重金與口岸三江營沿途等地各關口取得密切聯絡，故放胆前行，此批係試探性之舉動，尙有大批貨船四十餘隻，停泊三江營一帶坐觀風色，如能順利抵鎭，當卽繼續啓行。</p>
<p>現調查此項工作人員以該船貨物內，不知是否藏有違禁物資及武器，且乘客多身份不明，特令原船停汨江心，不許登陸，已將詳情向保安司令部報告，請示辦法，該部副司令楊宗鼎於十八日晨特派城防指揮部會同船舶管制站派員趕赴丹徒嚴格檢查後，業將該批船隻於當日深夜押解鎭江，聽候處理。聞此大批走私案內牽連各有關關口要員甚多，省保安部對此案將嚴予處辦。</p>
<p>鎭江沿江一帶，現尙停泊大小漁船不下數百艘之多，自當局下令封鎖長江下游後，許多漁戶捕魚受了影饗，生計勢將陷於斷絕，日前曾推代表多人至鎭江漁會呼籲救濟。該會業將此種苦情分呈縣府及駐防海陸軍部隊，請求俯念民生，規定時間地點採捕，未識能否邀准，尙成問題。</p>
<h3 id="c131">「開放梧州」的爭議 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 報特派員　梁風</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十九日航訊〕李代總統南巡廣州後的第三天：孫閣任內的第四十五次政務會議中，通過了一條重要的決議案，這便是：開放廣州梧州為對外貿易商埠。因為，這在民國史上，是一頁新的記載。政府這一措施公布後，卽引起全國，尤其是廣東廣西兩省人士的極大注意。但是，為了本身的利益關係，粵挂兩省人士，對這問題的看法，却有了兩個相反的意見，因而發生了劇烈的爭議。</p>
<p>反對派的見解</p>
<p>在廣東方面，反對最力的是粵穗商會，米糧公會，和輪船，海員工會等工商團體。他們認為：梧州開放以後，外貨就由梧州直接傾銷於西南各省，和廉價將原料性貨品搜購，這對西南各省的工商業，將會受到强烈的摧殘；西南各省的老百姓的經濟命脈，也會被榨取凈盡無遺。而最主要的，就是關係國家主權喪失的問題。他們指出：從整個國策上看，通商口岸祇限於沿海地區，而梧州是華南的心臟，梧州口岸一旦開放，不但違反了基本國策，而且以帝國主義的力量，就可以由通商，而至護航，護僑，商船和兵艦，都一步一步的深入到我們的心臟了！如果以便利對外貿易為理由，那末，蘭州，貴州，重慶，甚至任何一個地區，都可以這理由來開放了。國民大會曾有過決議：「不得以任何理由，開放航權。」何况我國工商業落後，目前的入超已影響到整個國家經濟，開放以後便更不堪想像的了！所以他們說：他們是純粹站在國家主權的立場上，來堅決的反對和抗議到底；如果請求政院撤銷這個決議沒有結果時，則準備向立法院呼籲，務求達到目的為止。</p>
<p>堅持開放梧州</p>
<p>相反的，在廣西方面，他們則請政府從速開放梧州。這裏可以以本月十五日，桂省參議會第廿三次駐委會所發表的書面談話，以及呈中樞的電文，作為他們一般意見的代表。他們的理由是：梧州為華南進出主要口岸，桂省和黔浙一部地區，經由該埠出口之大帮土產，直運港澳銷售，約佔全國出口量豐分之八至二十八；輸入民生日需品，由港澳直運該埠轉銷內地，為數亦鉅。梧州海關收入在戰前統計，對外貿易在全國四十海關中之第九位。同時穗梧航綫四一八公里，港梧航綫四三二公里，本相差無幾，但現一切貨物繞道廣州運輸出口，增加運費，遷延時日，成本亦加重，致不能貨暢其流，使內地生產萎縮，民生受着絕大影嚮，抑亦减少外匯輸入及稅收，國家財政金融亦同受損失。至內河航權開放為有失國家主權問題，他們反駁說：現不平等條約早經取消，關稅亦能自主，實非與遜淸被迫訂約開放通商口岸可比；且廣州，漢口，長沙等處及其他內地商埠，早經設有海關，均可對外貿易，而與梧州恢復海關征稅職權，及開放對外貿易權，便利商民，繫榮內地經濟，促進生產增加之意義，實不相悖。</p>
<p>問題愈形擴大</p>
<p>我們從上列所舉看來，他們是各執一詞，也各有各的理由，然正因為各有理由，所以這問題便幾乎在日益擴展着。但話又說回來，還是為着他們各人自身的利害問題而已。因為梧州開放以後，在廣西，最主要的是能增加稅收，與繁榮地方。但在廣東來說，因為梧州是西江內河港口，為由粵入桂之衝，以前外貨入西南，必須經過廣州這個轉運站。所以梧州開埠，首先受到打擊的是粵穗的航商，其次是廣州與西南各省經常作對外貿易的聯號，再其次是廣州今後的糧源亦受影響，他們認為今後的桂糧，可隨普通商品而逃至香港，這便廣州米糧公會也要反對的理由。前政院秘書長說得好，他曾對記者說：「這問題很簡單，廣東人是為了廣東的利益，廣西人是為了廣西的利益，其實都是國家的利益」。所以他又說：「政院已有了很好解決的辦法。」不過，他却沒有把這辦法說出來。</p>
<p>監委行署看法</p>
<p>同時，兩廣監委行署，對這問題，也很重視。究竟利害如何？開放航權於我將來主權有無影響？和這案在政院通過時的實情如何？現在已派員調查中。據曾赴桂巡察返穗的監委張駿說：桂省異常貧之，渠所經各地，軍政公務人員生活，均甚困苦，然為維持地方治安，團隊又不能少，負担遂重。開放梧州口岸，冀能增加稅收，以資彌補，是否與此有關？故現在須交付調查，俟得到結果後，始能辦理。</p>
<p>不過，這問題雖然仍在雙方積極活動中發展，但，反正都是自己人，相信總不至鬧到怎樣的嚴重吧。</p>
<h3 id="c132">黔省的苦悶 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽十六日航訊〕「三分春色二分愁，又一番風雨」，這是初春天氣的寫照，也是目前國內大局的象徵，更是黔省當局的心情。貴州每當政綱失墜，秉承無由之際，它因為受了地理條件與歷史因素的種種限制，其所感到的苦悶徬徨，較之任何隣省為特別顯著。</p>
<p>以言目前貴州的政治動態，就路綫與作風而談，</p>
<p>粵桂湘鄂　遠在去冬早有應變準備，以地勢，交通，經濟條件的優越關係，也素為中樞所眷顧，他們政治方面的苦悶，的確比較貴州少得多。川滇兩省自然一向號稱「情形特殊」，也惟其因為「情形特殊」，無論當局或是在野，作起事來就極鮮估計，換句話說，這兩省似複雜而實平易。惟有貴州不然，地勢處於「各大」之間，事齊事楚，煞費周章，就親仁善隣的作風來努力自衛自給，以小事大，本已憂憂乎其難，何况國內大局沉悶已久，漢口，南京，廣州之間，火色更是難於看準，在一個與溪口有悠長歷史淵源的元老重臣而兼孤臣孽子的人，偏偏在這無兵無馬又無錢的邊遠角落裏，四方八面都要請他明朗態度，其苦悶程度就可想而知。</p>
<p>貴州是中央的貴州，中央是中國人的中央，憑歷史瞭解，以至大至剛的精神，把良心拿出來，為中國人的中央，為中央的貴州作事，沉着氣，站着崗位，多做事少說話，勉强撑過這度難關，也未使不是一個平穩辦法。但就省內政治情况而言，也是時局影響人心的發展關係，黔西南受滇桂邊區匪患的影響，黔東北受川湘邊區匪患的影響，加以連年抗戰戡亂，民生凋敝不堪，選災積小成大，狡黯者恩怨分明，各地社會治安秩序，總是迄鮮平復之望。用軍事解決，民不畏死，何况地方武力，根本並不健全。用政治解決，姑息養奸，更足以獎勵作奸犯科。雙管齊下，也未見得收什麼續效，不見乎修文省參議員馬恒麟稱兵作亂的結果，到頭來還是只有依靠武力解決。談到貴州的</p>
<p>財政經濟　由於它地瘠民貧，離開了中央，它就一籌莫展，省財政方面百分之九十五靠中央撥款恊濟，前在公敎人員每月發薪十二倍的時候，全省每年就須依賴中央撥發五十億纔够開支，從三月份起改為生活指數發薪，需款之大，當然可以想見。國地共分稅，地方收益不見得够稅收人員的開支，而偷漏中飽情事，雖經盡力整理防制，也是口號自口號，舞弊揩油者仍所在多有。尤其是中央最近決定，自三十七年糧食會計年度屆滿之後，不再舉行賦糧徵實徵借，軍公糧今後究何所從出，的確使主財政者仰屋興嘆。省府方面最近將減配公敎人員每人每月所領的公糧四市斗為二市斗，想挹注公糧為以後地方武力所必需的軍糧之用，這是最使公敎人員為以後生活叫苦的事，然亦無可如何。貴州在昔年軍閥時代，省財政是依靠賣鴉片烟來彌補支付，前些日子也有人向當局獻策，不如將全省分區禁烟，有的認眞，有的從緩，率性讓人民種烟，旣可解決動亂的農村治安問題，又可彌補省級財政赤字，惟谷主席對於鴉片烟素來深惡痛絕，堅決反對，其事乃寢。</p>
<p>當前貴州最為嚴重的財政金融問題，是中央銀行貴陽分行因為總行趕印不及，無金圓券運筑，同時貴州交通不便，</p>
<p>現鈔運輸　時惑不能接濟之苦，而國庫署方面對於黔省的中央機關與省級機關所發的支付書，又往往遲延到半月一月始能寄到，卽使寄到，央行又無現鈔撥付，如此拖延脫節，不啻是整個財政系統解體的前奏，毋怪黔省高等法院，國立貴大，貴師，貴醫三院校，及省政府方面，經常與筑央行吵吵鬧開，為了撥款，爭得面紅耳赤，等到公敎人員費盡力氣領得十倍二十倍薪俸時，物價早已高跳到五十倍百倍的程度。央行方面由於現鈔奇缺，窮於應付，遂大發其一萬五萬的大額本票，造成了市面交易貼水有至七折八折不等現象，於是銀根轉緊，子息增高，物價飛漲，人民生活更是苦不堪言。大家都在說，金圓券在走法幣的老路綫，而金圓券還不如法幣值錢。這痛苦在目前不僅是貴州一省為然，可是百分之九十都靠中央撥發金圓券來恊助的貴州，所惑痛苦當然為甚。</p>
<p>要是出產豐富，物資充盈的省份，到也無何苦悶，「無」的地方總要來請求「有」的地方，可是貴州不然。棉花紗布必須仰賴湖南，五金電科百貨必須仰賴廣東，人民一日不可或缺的食　更是純粹依靠四川，貴州人所用東西，無論什麼都要用錢</p>
<p>向外省買　，而貴州人又偏偏無錢。谷正倫主席返黔主政快要一年了，他洞悉癥結，主張普遍增加生產，以美菸，菜，桐油等物去換省外的花紗食鹽，一年來，這問題依然如故，並無若何起色。且舉食鹽為例：川鹽運黔，道遠運艱，擱本子金太高，官商勾結舞弊，遂主張劃黔省為食鹽特銷區，打破食鹽銷案制度，准許開放粵，　，淮鹽入黔自由暢銷。在這一決定之下，黔省公營的物產運銷公司首先領得鹽貸，並已向廣州兩廣鹽務局購運了兩批粵鹽來黔，由該公司直接配售與貴陽市民食用。可是，由廣州運鹽來筑，距離上並不比自　捷樂為近，在廣州購運粵鹽，一切價格是以當時港幣為準，在川購運，則是以官定倉價金圓券為準，粵鹽到黔，雖不是「荳腐搬成肉價」，但並不如人們的理想。</p>
<p>廣東方面最需要貴州的菜，桐油，黔省物產運銷公司去年曾與宋子文的廣東物資調節委員會，訂有合同，彼此等價</p>
<p>交換物資　，黔物產公司曾經先後交運了一百多噸菜油到廣州去，也打算繼續的為他們交運桐油，棓子，美菸等土產去換點「外匯」回來，偏偏命不逢時，宋子文垮台，物調會心臟就停止跳動，以致黔物產公司現在還存有三四百大桶菜油無法運交，這是說目前的貴州，物資調節方面也同其深感苦悶。幸而黔省</p>
<p>地方武力　近已逐漸增强，據主其事者很自負的說，不要說各地的跳梁小醜，短期間內不難一一平息，那怕一旦共軍壓境，三五萬人的侵略力量，也不難逐出省外。黔省現有純地方武力，計擁有七個省保安團，七個專員區獨立營，此外，還有七十九縣民衛常備中隊。黔東西兩個師管區也將各成立二個至六個補充團，並可各成立一個裝配現代化的補充團，最近第六編練司令部又在貴州境內新褊組第九十八軍一個軍兩個師，分駐黔北黔西，一切由國防部負担，但可純作確保地方治安之用。重慶綏署張羣主任復面准提前補充黔省地方武力的械彈，以求普遍充實，完成省縣兩級地方武力的裝備，這件事眞大足以使正在苦悶的責州感到一絲微笑。</p>
<p>谷正倫一向不苟言笑，近幾個月似乎更甚，我們尙且感到貴州正面臨苦悶，想來他必深具同感，所以，他勗勉他的僚屬，主張埋頭苦幹，多作事，少說話，他並於昨（十一）日省府常會席上提出他的「卅八年度中心工作實施計劃大綱」，以「自覺，自衛，自治，自給」四項為其基本原則，沉着兒，勇往前進，貴州的苦悶，或許在不遠的將來，卽可獲得開朗。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>「軍民合作歌」也被美國軍中所採用，現在美國的軍隊裏廣泛的唱着舒模所编製的曲譜。他們的生活是相當的艱苦，領着極少的餉銀到處奔波忙碌。抗戰結束後，他們仍舊在文化的崗位上工作着，由漢口而南京，由南京而抗州。這是一支文化陣綫上的勁軍</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿日訊］無限春光蒞臨到西子湖濱的時候，這裏有着一個很有意義的文藝活動，那便是演劇四隊的「春季歌舞會」。</p>
<p>「演劇四隊」</p>
<p>提起「演劇四隊」，這是一們熟悉的名字，他們在抗日戰爭的時期，曾經站在文化戰的最前綫，與敵人日本作着文化的鬥爭，他們曾在第四戰區輾轉工作，他們曾在戰時的「文化城」——桂林躭過很久的時間，隊長魏曼靑，是位堅毅的文化工作者，其中還有一位作曲者舒模，他的歌曲如「你這個壞東西」，「軍民合作歌」，都被廣大的人民所唱着，而且，值得我們欣羨，值得我們稱頌。</p>
<p>在杭州，過去也有狠多次的歌舞會與很多次的話劇演出，而他們這一次的演出竟震動了整個的杭州。首先是抗州的報紙，大家以專欄的地位來頌揚他們這次工作的成功。同時是大羣大羣的觀衆聽衆都擁向他們演出的地方，再次，有很多學校團體都要求他們去演出一次，作為以後工作的示範。他們為什麼會獲得如此的成功？那就是他們歌唱舞蹈出人民的聲音。</p>
<p>樸美的語言</p>
<p>端木　良曾經與記者討論音樂的定義時，我們覺得音樂是最純樸的世界語，也是人類所共有的最優美的最華麗的語言。如何使音樂成為世界語？如何使音樂為人類所共有，那只有接近人民，與人民生活在一起，擷取他們眞善美的情緒，進而闡發創造。我們中國是最早承認音樂敎育價值的民族，可惜後來被少數人所覇佔，遺留下來的卽將堙沒的民歌，現在我們應該去接觸它，親近它，把人民眞正的聲音發揚出來。記得在抗戰時期的大後方，有一次和音樂家盛家倫晤及，我們暢談人民音樂的重要，他說：「我們意見很接近！我預備深入各邊遠地區，採集民歌。」好幾次，我們和音樂家馬思聰晤及，也談到這一層，他曾虛心的問我，他所彈奏的音樂中何則最好？我告以我所最愛好的是「西藏音詩」與「綏遠組曲」我們曾討論到最新的音樂是什麼？所獲的結論是最新的音樂形式與內容應該是最大多數人所愛好的，應該使最大多數人都能領悟，而歌唱者也應該相當圓潤。是的，我們從前的音樂，散佈在民間，使人民在音樂的生活裏感着自由愉快，後來音樂被作為裝飾與點綴，人民的音樂生活也就漸次被遺棄，現在我們要把音樂重新普及到民間去，使大多數的人民，都能享受。</p>
<p>摸索與努力</p>
<p>演劇四隊這次的演出也就是附合着我們所討論的，他們以新型的姿態來演出民間的生活。在全般的節目中合唱有「總理紀念歌」，「墾春泥」，「濃家苦」，「黎明快來臨」，「插秧謠」。齊唱有「春到人間」，「迎春謠」，「　冰歌」，「壞婆娘」，男聲獨唱有「墾建歌」，「送大哥」，男聲對唱有「聽我說」，「兩親家」，女聲獨唱有「苦命的媳婦」，男女對唱有「兩口子對唱」，民間舞有「趕車尋夫」與「王大娘補缸」，舞踊有「嘉戎酒會」，與「苗舞」。可說完全是民間東的西把它搬上了舞台，在這許多的曲舞中，充分說明了民間的幽怨，艱苦，但是他們有着豐富的生命力，眞摯坦白的情懷，他們在摸索，在努力。</p>
<p>走向一條路</p>
<p>尤其可貴的便是那「趕車尋去」，伴奏舞姿歌唱都已臻入了完美的藝術新境界。當然，他們不是喝過洋水專門唱西洋歌的「音樂家」，也不是專門以西洋的樂器奏出西洋的樂曲「音樂家」，他們的修養不如「音樂家」，然而他們的表演是這樣的眞摯，他們被一個觀衆所讚賞，他們是今後灌漑新音樂的一滴甘露。</p>
<p>大局正是和戰未決的關頭，人民正陷在水深火熱中，配合着春的來臨，在這已經嗅着了火藥氣味的天堂演出着民間的歌舞，意義是十分深厚的，我們希望今後的藝術能循着這個方向共同努力。</p>

<h3 id="c134">「謠風」後川政近態 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　周學端</p>
<p>〔本報成都十四日航訊〕半月川政，動盪謠風，隨着張羣就職視事，號召川康將領大團結之後，表面上雲開霧散，雨過天青。這幾天，張羣去京出席國是會議，帶去安定西南整個計劃；王陵基，劉文輝，鄧錫侯聯袂返蓉，分別執行任務，成都政治空氣，似乎由絢爛而平淡。但省日府來突又採種種不平凡措施，引起社會特別重視，一般觀察，到今四川天政局才發展到演變過程的最高點。</p>
<p>自衛謀和各種佈署</p>
<p>當前川政第一重點，是全川朝野一致薪求的「自衛謀和」，卽從增强本身力量中，爭取全面和平。最近陝南鄂北，情勢較緊，川防有新佈署；原駐宜昌的川鄂邊署綏靖主任孫震，退鎭梁山，改任川中綏靖區司令，指揮孫元良，羅廣文兩兵團，屏障川東。原屬川陝邊區綏署指揮的九五軍黃隱部，鎭守廣元，配合由漢中南下的胡宗南部隊，保衛川北。川省內部防務，準備編練七個川防軍，擴充廿個保安團，配合中央新近在川成立的七個國防軍，作為自衛安川基本力量。省府正在實施的全川民衆自衛組訓計劃，已有一百四十四市縣全面展開，參加組訓民衆，共四千三百卅六大隊，五十四萬六千五百七十五分隊，一百七十六萬二千九百卅五人，連同自衛幹部，總共四百餘萬，下月內卽全部完成武裝準備。另外四川與鄰境各省聯防，已有川甘陝湘鄂滇黔七省完成聯防計劃，成立聯防機構廿三處，聯防縣九十八縣。省境內外，經月來佈署，已築成銅牆鐵壁。</p>
<p>人事更動採新措施</p>
<p>省府配合自衛擴軍，近日連續採取兩椿非常措施。第一是全川人事大更動，第一次在五日更調縣長卅名，稅捐處長六十三名，田糧處長九名，第二次九日又更調廿二縣重要人事，半月宦海浮沉，一百餘縣均被牽動。內幕如何，費人猜測。第二是全川保安團大點騐，王陸基親自主持，除駐防松理　汶的保三團，開拔到蓉，集中受檢外，王氏復親偕保安副司令等，出巡川北，並轉川南川中一帶，點騐保安各團，督導民團組訓。這和上月川局謠風橎盪中，保安六團長通電攻擊省府當局一事兩相對照，一般認為，此次點騐行動，意義並不平凡。這兩件措施，恰正發生在川政謠風以後，　王陵基表示：純為加强政務推進，但從侧面觀察，似乎含有政治的軍事的整肅作用。同時王在八日省府國民月會中，破口大駡，對最近社會大量發現的攻擊渠本人傳單文件，指為少數不肖份子故意搗蛋，渠將照戒嚴司令資格，澈底淸查逮捕，這正說明川局猶有暗流醞釀，省府王在整肅防變。</p>
<p>民意主流要求安定</p>
<p>而臨時局歧途，經過十年離亂，兩川人民一致　求的是：要和不要戰，要變不要亂。壬陵基在省府月會中報告川省今年中心工作，第一是以自衛謀安全，第二是在安定中求進步。向傳義代表省參議會，出席西南軍政會議，强調四點要求：（一）要求和平，（二）革新政治，（三）整理經濟，（四）自衛自救。但自衛安定的先決條件，要先謀團結，最近川政播盪，謠諑紛傳，原因半是行動不協調所引起。如上月康軍調動，週來省府措施，陜南胡宗南小部近調鹽亭·三台·中江整訓，新編國軍在各地自由招募兵員，川國防軍人事不恊調等等。內幕都使局外人費盡疑猜，致啓造謠者以口實；目前朝野正作種種努力，從事消弭無形。如省參會電請中央停止征兵，嚴禁自由招募，婉請胡軍暫緩來川整訓，用意都在减少四川政局的複雜性，先求內部安定澄淸，再謀團結自衛，以達成大西南聯防互助，共同爭取全面和平的最後目的。這是當前各方共謀安定四川的三部曲，也是全川人民衷心擁護的正確措施，這是一股民意主流，經這主流衝盪之下，一切暗流將被淹沒淘汰毫無疑義，川局澄淸，短期必見分曉。</p>

<p>苦女原係上海人，民國廿六年時被惡人拐騙賣於靑島一個暗娼家，迄今在他們打駡聲中已經苦度十二年了。在這十二年過程中，無日不思家中親愛的父母和兄姊們，無奈在嚴緊的看管之下，叫我這無依無靠孤苦伶仃的一個弱女插翅也難飛出這人間地獄。苦女在千思萬慮中，才思得一綫光明，祈求貴報助我一臂之力，代為尋找苦女之父母兄姊，俾可早日脫離苦海。</p>
<p>以下是我的家庭狀況和被人拐騙的經過：</p>
<p>曾記得我姓陳（名字已忘），現年十九歲。被騙那年我正七歲，父母健在，還有一個哥哥和二個姐姐（時大姐已出嫁）。父親是一個跑生意的，那時哥哥和二姐還在學校讀書，記得我還有一個弟弟，因病而雙目失明，不久卽死去。我的家住在中正中路某一個拐角，在一個鐘錶店的樓上。有一天隔壁有一家娶親的，我就偷偷地跑過去看熱鬧，有一個中年男子向我說：我帶你到你的姑姑家中玩去好吧。我眞有一個姑姑那時還在開木廠，所以我就跟了他去，那裏知道甚中了那惡人的奸計了。我被他騙到鄉下，隔了一日，他就帶着我和一個少婦一個老太婆還有一個不知從何處騙來的比我大一點的女孩子，坐輪船到靑島。將我賣於一個暗娼家，從此我就　他斷了！此時此地，呌我一個孤女有何辦法呢？請諸位先生大發慈悲之心，賜予登出，或頗上天庇護，我的父母兄姊尙居滬市，得見報端，來救我脫離苦海！</p>

<p>全日成交數量不多過程閒散</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金商業同業公會，業於昨日上午十時起，正式恢復集布買賣，惟並未舉行任何儀式，該業領袖徐輔蓀及該公會代理理事長趙仲英等，均親臨主持。財政部·金管局·中央銀行·市社會局·及市商會等，均派員出席指導。劉攻芸·林崇墉·李道南·李　哉·潘恒勤等，均致送花籃，藉誌賀忱。</p>
<p>昨日該公會以恢復集市伊始，對講電話綫舖設竣事者，迄昨日開市前為止，共僅卅九架，惟昨日又陸續裝好十八架，故全日市塲交易頗為閒散。買賣呌價起伏極微，各會員敲出敲進之數，歷久方有一二條成交，總計上午成交共約百餘條，（卽千餘兩），下午成交則僅十餘條。</p>
<p>昨日金市走勢，以公會正式集市，復聞國行近午有拋，行市由上午盤檔之勢，趨於下午全面轉跌之尚。以上午開市每兩五五七〇〇〇，與下午收市每兩五一六五○〇之行市相較，一日間每大條軋跌達四十萬〇五千元之鉅，亦可謂金融當局巳開始發揮其對正式公開市塲之控制力。</p>
<p>昨晨金市初開為五五七，入後盡屬盤局，迄十二時，以五四六收市。下午卽以五一七低盤開出，最低見五一六小盤，最後以五一六五收市，過程輕描淡寫而已。</p>
<p>又昨日業內外各號，以目今市面買賣流通之黃金，成色大多在九八五左右，茲按公會買賣細則，已硬性規定必需在九八五以上，否則須照成色補算，並加藥工二錢，多表不滿，故有相率停止交易之議。惟據公會方面表示：公會對買賣細則之擬議，均係根據財部規定，當未便隨予修改。現市而因驟改習慣，或有不便，惟遵循一久，自可扭正成色不足之習慣云。</p>
<p>又據劉攻芸氏談稱；金業公會恢復集市後，國行配金停止，改在該市塲拋售。現該布塲祗限於黃金之買賣，至銀元之拋售方式，則猶待次一步之研討。</p>

<p>昨日情形雖較好轉，惟亦延至六時許，始告交換完畢。</p>

<p>减輕內地辦貨成本</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會昨函中央銀行業務局，請壓平內地匯水，便利辦貨。函云：茲據輸出各業商人來會聲稱，滬地出口商，向產區辦貨，所匯之款，因有拆息負担，理應升水，俾得平衡。乃最近內匯幣值，一再貶低，例如由滬運往四川萬縣之金圓券，每千元在萬縣祇能收到四百元，若取現鈔，則祇有三百元，貶值之甚，賅人聽聞。</p>
<p>至於產區貨價，則因生活指數之遞增，漲勢每超過滬地而上，出口商在兩相煎迫之下，如何進行採辦，應請責令行莊迅行辦到平匯等語到會。查國內通匯，向由貴行規定匯水，凡商營行莊承做匯款，其匯水不得超過規定匯　若干限度，歷經辦理。</p>
<p>茲據聲稱前情，應請貴行對於匯水奇昂地方，酌加調劑，寬為調撥頭寸，俾收壓平匯水之效，使滬商往內地辦貨，得以稍輕成本，國計民生，交受其賜，敬希督核辦理，見復施行。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華股市况，昨日走勢初開卽見呆板，中間轉入瘟疲狀態，股市人心，慘淡已極。自高利貸市上流行後，股市漲勢遠較一般物價為差，因之市勢頓挫，人心渙散，多頭頗感乏味。</p>
<p>晨間因隔夜銀根緊悄影響，暗息俏升，日拆高至八五元九五元間，似此重利威脅，實予股市以重大打擊。於是多頭沒落，空方抬頭，塲上賣氣驟旺，市勢一蹶不振。</p>
<p>永紗晨開以七元二三低盤開出後，散空起補，微升至七元三角三，三角六，聞央行有拋金之訊，業中人心破碎不堪，大戶多抱觀望，形勢冷淡。中間起伏狹隘，一路在低檔瘟盤，嗣後圈外黃金猛瀉，市上銀根劇緊，調度頗滯，金業帮銀行帮為按排頭寸，不斷拋售，市勢益告不支，瀉至六元九二，終以六元六八午收。</p>
<p>中小型股，晨開尙平，中間檯面襯托甚烈，一度在疲檔中獨創高峯，但幕後拉抬，漲勢甚虛，午收時終因大勢均軟，無法堅立，結果同告回落。信和統益景綸勤興內衣等均平開低收，新光景福美亞開後一度趨堅，午收回落，其餘雜牌均呈萎靡，全市成交五十三億五千四百生十五萬股，</p>

<p>黃金公債昨日執戶扳持，買氣未旺，交易頗寂，晨開三十六萬出，未有受戶，喊價小落五○○〇元，低後賣氣仍旺，續小至三五一〇〇〇元，嗣後重又盤升為三五五〇〇○元午收。後市初做三十五萬元，繼卽小至卅四萬，最後仍以二十五萬收市，成交八十一兩。</p>

<p>市塲在應變目標更狹隘　放息利仍厚走勢看經常</p>
<p>一般市塲，都充分出現着應變的狀態。</p>
<p>昨天金市初開，走勢軟疲，賣足了央行的面子。</p>
<p>股市依然萎靡，原是應變期的當然現象：可是錯落昨一機會，或許反便利了出股進金的人，也未可知。</p>
<p>在政局新佈置時期，大家加倍提心吊胆着。往時，凡遇靑黃不接時，總會熱鬧一番。現在恰如其反。</p>
<p>做空做多，過去常有落袋為上主義；為了夜長夢多。現在呢，都有一動不如一靜之勢，為着都有夜盡夢斷之懼。眞可謂此一時，彼一時了。</p>
<p>然則，經常走勢，當非記住不可。提前一週敲出貨物，放拆息準備月底頭寸，這日期又迫近了。</p>
<p>旣在應變狀態，金·鈔·銀元·米·煤·五大目標，當為所有目光集中之點。金鈔有央行做手；銀元除發薪時期外，平時本出多於進。因而米煤兩大生活必需品，情勢將越趨越深。</p>
<p>連日米煤價格激漲，在市民心頭，果已恐慌萬分；但折合金價，還是落後。</p>
<p>然則，這幾天進金鈔銀元的，若和放息比較一悉，算算都是虧蝕。譬如前天收市金價五十四萬七千五百一兩，按當天五角五日拆合算，昨天的本息合計應該有五十七萬七千六百元；但市價跌剩五十一萬八千五，無異蝕了本息一成强。</p>
<h3 id="c154">食米一再騰升　特粳見六萬八千元高價　麵粉止漲回跌食油再漲 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>米價昨日挺升甚多，因上日上漲不足，故貨主扳價，加之無錫報漲，天又下雨，心理更堅。北市塲白粳薄稻各高達六萬五千元，各漲七千元，特粳六萬八千高價，南市塲初漲五六千，中市銀根緊，略下退千元，薄稻六萬三千，漲五千元，惟收市甚處。二市到貨共計四三八五石。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>再挺，以米價上漲，人心甚堅，貨主卽提高價格，但以銀根緊，收市轉軟，豆抽初開二十五萬，大有餘最高二十五萬六千元，收市二十五萬四千元，軋漲萬元，生菜油亦漲萬元，收市二十三萬九千元，吉桶生油三十四萬五千，亦軋升萬元。豆餅交易淸，價略昂。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>止漲回跌，初市銀根尙稱平穩，米價續揚，各牌粉曾一度上漲，後聞央行大量拋出金條，銀根立見緊俏，市勢節節後退，老車後市二萬二千四百元，兵船以二萬一千三百八十元最後成交，麩皮一度高做萬八千元，收市亦見回跌，大包福新做萬七千九百五十元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>收市較早，初市銀根尙穩，芝蔴大生油廠力吸，猛晋二成以上，黃蔴奶蔴齊破十萬，生仁黃豆受後市銀根猛緊影響，市勢先漲後回，較昨仍見軋升，苞米紅糧客銷頗暢，各挺一成左右。</p>
<h3 id="c155">草綠呢嘰寂寞 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日中央銀行發給同業之現鈔限額，已自日前之一成增為一成二。</p>
<p>據該行關係方面告記者：該項限額，當視實際情形如何，而設法逐漸寬放，大致高至二成三成</p>
<p>據表示：照目前情形，限額提取現鈔制，至少可控制行莊若干借之存款額，亦可减少對物價之壓力。現鈔限額提取後，對緊縮發行亦不無助力。昨日共發出五百元券約十餘億元，較日前略少</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：六區棉紡公會民營各廠三月份南運紗布限額為棉紗四千六百件，棉布十三萬六千疋，截至本月十五日止，棉紗部份申請南運者四三廠，計原配額為三一七四件，（廿一日止已申請裝運者二九〇一件，尙未申請裝運者二七三件，）函請保留配額者廿一廠，計一〇四〇，放棄者廿八廠，計三八六件。</p>
<p>棉布部份申請南運者六三二九二疋，尙未申請裝運者計四二八〇〇疋，函請保留配額者八廠，計二三九三二疋，放棄者三廠，計五二三四疋。</p>

<p>昨日棉紗市况，因業內銀根緊俏，（日拆八十元以上，）故納戶進意淡泊，但執戶以成本關係，亦不願脫手，致塲內交易轉趨冷落，各紗俱以疲檔收市。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳自三百八十萬隔日午收價開出，一度曾喊高至三百八十五萬元後，遂鬆落至三百七十三萬元結局，較前降七萬元。四〇支藍鳳微挫一萬元，三二支銀月初開二百五十八萬元，一度晋至上日午收價，最後終於在浮多支撑無力之下，一路小至二百五十六萬元，終跌七萬元。</p>
<p>二二支雙馬始開迫近二百萬大關，旋聞業外物品平疲，人心不振，價乃退至一百八十七萬元，臨收浮空略有抵補，微回至一百八十九萬元收市，軋落五萬元，二〇支雙馬由一百八十五萬元步低一百八十萬元站住，較前跌六萬元，此外金城與天女等亦跟隨下游。</p>
<p>布市突起回風，良以銀根走勢轉緊，兼以圈外一致迫跌，且值紡建開貨之期，人心均告虛怯，散戶不勝高利負擔，紛紛吐售。近午賣風甚熾，各布均皆挫降。</p>
<p>龍頭細布由八萬五千元晋至八萬八千五百元為最高，臨收情况轉虛，終以八萬元低檔收市，軋跌四千元。喇叭童友B龍頭細布各小三千元之譜。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰初以七萬六千元開出，一度曾高見七萬六千七百元後，卽轉下游，最低喊過七萬二千六百元，終為七萬三千元，較前降二千八百元。金蓮妙舞元嗶嘰微挫一千元，民營廠以成本關係，如士林布與府綢等，廠盤一致提高，其中一九〇高檔士林，已叩十七萬元，但直銷依然平淡，實際做開不多。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海市工業會技術委員會昨發表紙盒工業槪况如次：自中外通商後，上海卽有紙盒之仿製。惟斯時尙無紙版出品，僅用草紙裱心三丁大連等類紙張併成製版，質地粗糙。使用盒子裝盛物品者，亦惟參燕國藥香粉等業，用途頗小。民十前後，國產紙版廠如華成華豐等相繼成立，但產量不多。至稱用盒子各業，首推西藥，次為釘織內衣鞋類糖菓，今則採用日廣，普及各業矣。</p>
<p>製盒程序，初以馬蹄小刀手工出胚，劃綫，糊以薄紙，卽成。近來因橡皮捲烟食品等業需用日多，裝璜日精，乃漸次啟用機器製造，茲略述其製造程序如下：</p>
<p>（一）機器製盒，首以紙版托白，然後印刷商標或牌號地址，再依印成之綫形，切成盒胚。最後以鉛絲軋釘卽成。惟機器製造，使用馬達設備者，尙屬少數，本市不過十餘家耳。</p>
<p>（二）手工製造，先以國產黃版紙托裏子，視盒之大小，切為方片，劃以折綫，然後配成毛胚，加以外層色紙，卽成。手工製盒分方形圓形角形多種，以及錦綾紅木裝璜等，手續旣極繁複，種類亦甚衆多。現該業單位，約在三百餘家，其未及改用機器者，究其原因，實為勝利復員以來，房荒嚴重，以及國產紙料不能增產，有以致之。如機器紙料能大量增產，普遍推行，則該業前途，方有發展希望。</p>
<p>紙盒一類，大都就地製造，就地消耗，行銷國外者，僅為出口貨物，附屬裝璜用品。</p>
<p>主要原料為黃版白版報紙道林紙牛皮紙，以及一切色紙，戰前大部份仰給於外貨，邇來各種國產紙料漸臻精良，均足替代，但尙不能完全自給。該業旣為複製品工業之一種，原料迄今朱得直接配購，不論黃版細紙，一槪仰給於紙商，輾轉買賣，價絡旣高，成本目鉅，以致應得利潤，被剝削殆盡，是亦該業之隱痛憾事云。</p>

<h3 id="c166">昨晚籃球分外緊張　回力奮戰仁餘失色　恩卡斯與麥令一塲惡戰延長時間中一球分勝負 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽，昨晚節目分外緊張，最後一塲甲一組回力竟以五二比四三勝仁餘，上半時十九比十七。仁餘先盛後衰，上半時雙方可稱勢均力敵，相差二分，尙不算多；下半時回力曹志吉的連捷，仁餘無異吃着一記悶棍，因局勢的緊張，他們動作亦驟見火氣，間接予回力以極多罰球機會。至於均調動頻繁，似亦失策。回力昨晚感風異常，曹王田三將尤為得意，仁餘以徐仲巳蔡金典兩人比較活動。</p>
<p>另塲甲一組恩卡斯與麥令斯，四十分鐘時為卅五平手，延長五分鐘恩卡斯以四四比四二勝二分。甲二C美氣象勝培爾，卅九比卅五。</p>
<p>先說壓軸大戰回力對仁餘，直至八時方開始。回力上塲五人為曹志吉，魏戍，葉震山，王永芳，田福流。仁餘以孫國政，徐仲已，李肇和，王槐庭，沈鵬舉五人應戰。中圈跳球，仁餘卽取攻勢，永芳犯規，肇和首先罰中。回力將士福海志吉運氣不佳。國政雲山各有所獲，仲已亦跳起命中，永芳二罰球，五比四仁餘尙在前領。旋雙方犯規，仲已中，福海失，沈鵬舉再增二分，八比四回力暫停。仁餘葉金典替槐庭，三分鐘混戰往返，各無所得，仁餘亦叫停。回力球運好轉，福海永芳谷中二罰球，頓成八分平手。鵬舉一分超出，金典奔進，捧入籃內。回力遠傳，福海冷門獨出，永芳生色，回力十二比十一頓告改觀。國政造成平手後，由槐庭入替，吳新運代金典，俄復成十四平手。蔡無恢復原狀，雲山福海罰中，永芳亦出手，上半時回力十九，仁餘十七。</p>
<p>這一塲的吸引力很不差，球迷約三千左右。下半時續戰，志吉開塲就顯威風，仁餘金典還報一球，老曹前度劉郎，廿五比廿。姚文彝綢出仲已，曹連擲帶罰，聲勢愈勵，廿八比廿二。新運代槐庭，回力罰球機會極多，仁餘調動人馬頗忙，不久卅八比廿二，仁餘落後十六分，已呈凶多吉少現象，此後金典仲已雖極力奮戰，奈得不償失，最後回力以陳正淼代王永芳，結果以五二比四三勝仁餘。</p>

<p>麥令斯與恩卡斯之補賽，恩隊先掛三分，却利邱區胡的繼續進攻，俄頃又成八比一，兩隊不少力的表演，麥令利斯高茀萊兩人異常搭擋，分數遂竿頭直上，且曾一度超過，上半時恩卡斯十九，麥令斯十七。</p>
<p>休息再較量，麥令連獲四分，看台間數十同伴怪叫歡呼，但局勢時常變化，上下不定，麥令廿七比廿二時，恩卡斯見形勢不佳，凱捷密洛夫親自出馬，調出邱大胖子，這裏始終保持着緊張的局面，恩隊奧柴遼·却利等戰志甚堅，在最後二分鐘，成卅五平手。延長五分鐘，再決雌雄。却利人堆中擲入第一球，雙方犯規，恩中麥失，繼麥令高茀萊及對方却利各中一球，利斯罰一分，恩隊泊透該罰中，麥令萊姆山投中，同時得罰球一次未入，尙差一分。最後一分鐘，泊透加三分，高茀萊亦中的，但仍差二分，恩卡斯卒以四十四比四十二勝。</p>

<p>— 戚譯述</p>
<p>學習運用移動區域防禦制，，守衛者絕對要站在戰略上的重要區域之內，就是在進攻者中距離投籃射程之內，這是百份之百是正確的，雖然是幾位進步的球員採用這個方式，亦要遵守這個原則，除非是看準了認為是得到萬全之機會才離防區來攔截對方之傳遞，要知熟則生巧，等到練習純熟，能够圓滑地運用時，球員就會知道何時擱截進攻者之傳遞才會發生效果。</p>
<p>初學打籃球的球員，切誡濫用擅自離開所防守之區域，而妄去攔截進攻者之傳遞的打法，這樣很容易陷於侵入犯規或因是而脚步不準致奔跑時超越過球之所在，守衛者之位置凌亂，給予進攻者以極大之便利。</p>
<p>上節是述明守衛者不宜輕於離開所防守之區域，幷非絕對呆板地執行；切要記牢，守衛是採用純粹的防守方式，守衛者切不可冒險賭博之嘗試。</p>
<p>守衛者在球塲中央界綫處企圖攔截雙方守衛傳遞過中綫之球，是最容易犯規和脚步不準的毛病；致應付對方守衛傳球過中綫可運用另一種方式來防禦；守衛者須要够機敏和有預感力，要在對方守衛未將籃球傳過中綫之前就須先採取防禦之佈置，下面是防禦對方守衛將球傳過中綫的兩個陣式。</p>
<p>（一）（請看圖拾壹）這一種防禦法是須要守衛與前鋒聯絡才發生效果；在對方守衛得獲控球在手裏時，進攻方面的三位進攻者應卽平排距離不遠站在中央界綫前佈下一道一字陣，左右兩衛則趨前到中央界綫處塡補着兩個空隙，正中衛則退守鑰匙孔眼界處來愼防進攻者接得球後竄入，這無異是在中塲佈下一座區域防禦陣；對方守衛無法將球用短傳遞方式來經過中央界綫而傳遞過對塲去，除了採用高遠的傳遞是無別法可想，但高遠之遞送是最容易被攔截的。</p>
<p>進攻者須注視着持球之守衛正在作短傳遞要離開罰球界綫之前。就應衝前去截掠該傳球者，而其兩守衛則隨後掩護，這樣向守衛者壓迫，可能使彼等慌亂而不能將球傳出，守衛者有時會被壓迫在一起，而無法施展傳遞的方法，或被迫跳球甚或球被欄截（未完·七）</p>

<p>— 梅潔</p>
<p>依照目下的女級戰續而言，我應該談『黎隊』。</p>
<p>黎隊的前身是前綫隊，而前綫則是女靑紫與靑聯的混合隊，前綫分散，靑聯的到星華隊去，女靑紫的是黎隊。所以現在的黎隊，等於以前的女靑紫，其中還少一個朱錦芸。所以要是以女靑紫的歷史和經驗論，有目前的戰績，可以說是有相當的收獲了。所謂相當收獲者，則便是本屈聯賽中僅改於綠隊而已，其中壓倒擁有四位全市代表的星華隊，豈非好收獲？</p>
<p>該隊始終是在苦練方法中。在女靑紫時代由吳詩鑑指導，前綫時候蔡通科担任。的確敎者諄諄，授者循然，比賽時也竭力運用方法，自然最初是生疏，漸漸地純熟起來，成績也隨之而進境了。此外，筆者最近更發現黎隊球員的一個特點，便是多看球，可以說是逢有比賽，總是降臨體育館的，我們應該體會到，球員能多看球，是頗有裨益的，看人家的優點，可為自身的藍本，多看也可增加臨陣經騐，那末，黎隊最近不斷的來看球，多少已是得到了益處。</p>
<p>以運用方法而看，黎隊也許比綠隊更認眞，可是無論如何，她們的陣綫，有着一個明顯的缺點，就是嫌身材太矮小，力似乎不足，所以缺少了一個衝刺殺辣的力量，那便難以盡情發揮了，譬如錢楚屏錢幽屏一對姊妹花，她們能射籃有避運功夫，可是生得那麼嬌小無力，就易於被對手看煞了。還有一個前鋒姚思濂，她比隸屬於星華隊的—她的姊姊姚思源要好，尤其中距離投射，可以說是在水準綫上，也就是缺乏力，沒有高速度，不能顯露出一個最佳前鋒的典型來，在這裏，我憶起了該除有一好前鋒叫曾昭淸的，的確是一個理想的人選，她在啓秀求學，由校醫的檢查說她有病不能運動，於是她祇能中止球事，倒確是黎隊的損失。（按曾昭淸現在已回到她的故鄉廈門去了）。</p>
<p>在此，我更發現出一個明證，女子籃球的前鋒一定要有短跑的天材，那才能有高速度的竄勢來威脅人家，譬如說：綠隊的黃明媛石宗蘭朱錦芸三位一體，可以說是目下滬上女短跑的三傑，因此，當她們三位任前鋒時像穿花蛺蝶的發揮速度，而有優良的演出了。反之像黎隊的三小將，她們全沒有這能耐，所以雖然有好的射藍和懂得作戰方法，却無如願以償的收獲了。願她們在這方面加以殷練。</p>
<p>至於談到黎隊的守衛力，陳文琰是相當可觀的，其餘兩位便比較少經驗，以至臨陣匆匆沒有理想中的佳好表演。這是球員必然要經過的一個過程，相當日期之後，一定能登堂入室無疑。</p>
<p>綜觀，黎隊已經打敗過星華，自然已有厚望拿本屆的亞軍一席，至少可與星華隊並列第二。拿她們的一切來與星華比較，可以不負一番苦練的努力了。自然我們希望她們能更上一級，我的意思，必須在體力方面求進展，經驗方面都體會，則燦爛的前途，是意料中的事，願黎隊諸小將勉之！</p>
<p>黎隊陣容：自右至左（後排）徐慕本，陳玉琴，陳文琰，蔡明霞，全利利，徐會如，（前排）鈕芸娟，姚思濂，錢楚屏，錢幽屏，朱翠棣，李瑤瑩。</p>
<h3 id="c173">女子體育問題 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 顏秀容</p>
<p>（一）女子體育的現狀</p>
<p>自歐美文化傳入中國以來，體育漸被認識為一個重要的部門，我國女子體育，自經卅餘年來之提倡與推動，在表面上看起來，似乎蓬蓬勃勃，以近年來女子各項田徑紀錄，球類的技術，以及參加的人數來說，好像女子體育，已經普遍地提倡起來，但祗要我們作深入的觀察和認識，就不難發見其中弊病；不是過度的中了競賽運動狂，就是被忽略與漠視。普通一般人對女子體育的觀點，約可分為二類：一頑固派—他們還抱着封建的思想，以為女子仍需帶着柔弱才算美，一種病態美的觀念，女子不應該跟男子一樣活動。在學校方面，一般頑固守舊的主管人，往往不知體育為何物，非但學校內缺乏一般體育設備，而對於體育敎師的選聘，與體育課程的實施，也只因循苟且，敷衍了事，體育是被漠視與忽略的，二過激派—過度中了競賽運動狂，淪為畸形的發展，不少機關，學校，或個人，不惜以巨資豢養少歡運動員，以為宣傳之工具，甚至為了錦標的爭奪，而尊重運動，妨害了女子體育的健康。</p>
<p>凡此種種，都使體育走向畸形的發展，不是缺之運動，就是錦標化的運動，完全違背了體育的意義，在現時代，體育對於身心的訓練與發展，已為一般也人所公認，反對女子運動的頑固派，應受時代的淘汰，但錦標化的運動，也應該受嚴格的改正，運動競賽的意義，原只是一種技術的推動與鼓勵，在刺激興趣，觀摩技術，若因此而妨害了身體的正常發展，則完全違背了體育的眞正意義，正常的體育，應該就女子身心的健康，其運動能力及精神鍛鍊的程度上，作普遍化的訓練，以堅强耐勞的體格，提高勇敢活潑的精神，它必須能帮助造成時代所需要的人材，訓練現社會所需要的婦女，體育才不失在敎育上的意義。</p>
<p>（二）女子體育的生理問題</p>
<p>女子為未來國民之母，體格的强弱，卽為未來子女健康之所寄，故欲改造整個民族的體格，則對於負整個生育責任的女子，其體格的訓練，極其重要，但女子體格，生理上與男子不相同，其體格，呼吸器官及血液循環等，與男子有顯著的分別，在解剖學上，兩性之差異，約有三點：（一）在靑春期後，女子骨盤顯然增闊，致股骨歪斜，在所有下肢的動作中，其骨盤均呈左右擺動之勢，此種擺動愈大，其前進之速度之受阻碍亦愈大，女子奔跑能力不及男子，此為主因。（二）女子由於生育的需要，其軀體在比例上較長，體高係數較男子大，加以骨盤放大，致身體重心較低。（三）女子肌肉較男子輕，脂肪則較重。故女子體力雖不如男子，但隱藏之潛勢力則多勝於男子，基於以上原因，兩性在生理上之差異，故其運動標準亦當宜有區別，以符合女子之健康。</p>
<p>（三）女子與運動</p>
<p>（一）女子與一般力的運動——全身筋肉之重要，就歐洲人論。男子平均為二四·五尅。女子平均為一四·七五尅，其全體體重之比，如男子為十，則女子為九，但其筋肉重量之比，如男子為十，則女子不過為六。且女子之生活，不論在家庭中，或服務社會，多不需要大筋肉，且就其性質之柔和而言，女子對於角力，拳鬥，舉重等一般力的運動，頗不適宜。</p>
<p>（二）輕捷運動——女子之上肢，對其軀幹而言，其長度較男子為短，因女子重心位置較男子為低，故輕捷運動，如縣垂，攀登，倒立，及轉迴等，對女子多不需要。</p>
<p>（三）舞蹈——女子身體之安定度較男子為大。因此在多需要舞蹈性之運動上，最為適宜，特別在精神方面予以活潑與愉快。</p>
<p>（四）體操——瑞典式，丹麥式之體操，動作不太强烈，而富韻律性，對女子是一適宜運動，但其中跳躍及縣垂動作，與男子較，應减低其程度。</p>
<p>（五）游泳——據多數體育家的意見，游泳運動對女子實為一種最適宜的運動，游泳的動作，皆為均等的，且不太激烈，女子之身體在水中易於浮起，及易於耐受水之寒冷，此外女子之性質，對游泳亦多喜好。</p>
<p>（六）球類——室內棒球，興越極大，打力投力均較小，可稱為適當之運動。網球動作優美，適宜女子的嗜好，排球對女子之是為適宜。雙球如不過激而行之，亦為一種適宜的運動。</p>
<p>（七）田徑賽運動——所有田徑賽之運動，如能加以注意及謹愼之練習，對於女于之身心，可謂有極大之利益，但長距離賽跑在體力上頗不適宜。</p>
<p>（八）其他各種運動——（A）自行車運動——在避免過勞的情形下，可視為一種適宜的運動。（B）划船運動——如行比賽，則需要强大之體力，頗不適宜，但如自由划行，則可發達胸部及上肢為一種適宜的體育運動。（C）登山及遠足—可視為極適宜於女子的運動，此運動並不需要一時的强大體力，且極富興趣。此外滑冰滑雪等運動，對於女子亦為適宜。</p>
<p>（四）今後女子體育的動向</p>
<p>今後女子體育，決不能以訓練幾種技能就算達到目的，它的訓練核心，應擴大到整個人生。該就身心健康之原則下，旅行普遍化，集體化，嚴格的訓練，一洗過去姣弱，柔懶，遲緩的動作，而趨向於健康的，敏捷的，勇敢的，耐勞的，意志堅强的，有奮鬥獨立精神的途徑做去。</p>

<p>— 鋤東</p>
<p>從電話的鈴聲，到報上的新聞，證實三月份的公務人員薪金定十五日發放。</p>
<p>辦公室內頓時起了一陣騷動，大家似乎有些不安·十五！不就是明天麼？</p>
<p>同事間的話題，都以這事爲對象。雖以素稱沉默寡言的主管科長，也不免時時參加了說話。</p>
<p>老沈計算着這筆進款的用途，因爲他的家還在一江之隔的彼岸，現在交通音訊早經斷絕，所以一個人住在公家的宿舍裏，只能買一點體積較小的物資存放。上次水電費發出的時侯，物價巳經漲得很高，他以爲總要停止一下，沒有買東西，結果打了一個大大的折扣，零碎花掉完事。他想這次要下個決心，等錢一拿到手，就要去買東西，但是想要買進賣出比較容易，體積又不過大的，決定還是買幾只袁大頭。</p>
<p>雖然職工生活指數已經到了一千多倍，公敎薪金還只有二百二十五倍，心頭不免有些不平呌寃。但這次究竟比上月多了兩倍，何况月底指數發表後，還可補發一次。上月是拿到七千五百元，這次是三五一十五，三七二十一，可以拿到兩萬兩千五百元。去了半個月的伙食五千元，捐款一千元，可凈得一萬六千多元。照現在的時價，可買四隻大頭。他決計錢一發到就去買。</p>
<p>第二天到了辦公室裏，同事的話題還是離不了「窈水」。有兩個豕眷在上海的，更急得像熱鍋上的螞蟻一樣。然而上午究竟平安地過去了，消息却是沒有；下午大門口放出了步哨棧，守候去銀行領款的吉普一到，可以最先拿到錢。但是一直等到下午散辦公，還是消息杳然。有些消息靈通一點的同事便說：今天銀根緊，怕領不到現鈔了，同時物價高漲的消息，不住地傳來，食米破四萬大關，大頭近五千了。</p>
<p>十六，十七兩天，都在緊張，期待，焦燥中過去。米價四萬五了，接着又超過了五萬；大頭由五千多漲到六千四百元，而到銀行去的領款人，却說還只領到了銅牌，兌不到現款。一個同事等急了，親自到銀行去看，回來報吿，據說：銀行裏的行員，也是急得沒有辦法，向各機關的領款人打躬作揖說：今天實在拿不出這許多現款來，就是殺了我們，也是枉然，明天一定設法照付。但是領款的人，還是不肯散去。停了一會又答應搭發三成現款，七成本票，然而大家知道本票若在市上通用需要貼水，所以結果沒有答應云云。</p>
<p>辦公室裏，到下午五點鐘大家還沒有散去這是向來所未有的事。失望，忿恨，咀咒，甚至一些野蠻的笑駡，激烈的提議，充滿了這間小屋子。正在無可奈何的時候，好消息終於帶來了，現款領到了，可是爲時已晚，明日請早。這才大家如皮球洩了氣，轟然作鳥獸散。</p>
<p>除扣凈存一萬六千元，終於在第二天拿到了手，是整齊的紫色新累，點起來，「嗤嗤」的響，數一數整整三十二張。</p>
<p>留下少數零用，買進了兩只寰大頭，——和預算已打了個對折。</p>
<p>清晨大家　着看自由談上的「薪水貶值記」，不禁起了會心的微笑，於是靈機一動，提筆作此「支」記。</p>
<h3 id="c175">鳥亦知醫 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>

<p>按獵人所用之箭，多用烏頭，鹿若中箭，毒發輒自能尋嚼豆苗解之。</p>
<p>雀欲奪燕巢，輒先銜艾葉一枚於其上，燕竟畏而避之，雀遂佔其巢，蓋燕惡艾葉也。</p>
<p>神農嚐百草而知藥性，但鳥獸亦能諳知，以豆苗解箭毒，艾葉作利器，其聰明之處，固不讓於人，亦云奇矣。</p>
<h3 id="c176">金圓與錫箔 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 徐卓之</p>
<p>因爲淸明將近，昨天去買了一千錫箔，以備上墳之用。中國人對於地下的祖宗向來看得比活人還重，雖然我自己不甚相信這一套，但因了妻的催促，還是去買了。一問，一千錫箔竟要金圓券五千四百圓，平均每張要五圓多。</p>
<p>至此，心裏實在不無感概。金圓券已經如此不値錢，通一作一地在陰司裏通用也不成了。拿着這厚厚一堆鈔票所換來的薄薄的一塊錫箔，在回家的路上，忽然想起，中央銀行正在想盡辦法，　　　鬥怯，知今何不在這上面也動動腦筋呢？</p>
<p>淸明將屆，上海，乃至全國，所燒去的錫箔的數量，一定是很可觀的。如果中央銀行能够想一個辦法，使老百姓（尤其是老婆婆們）相信，我們的金圓券在陰司也可以通用，而且絲亳不曾貶値，每四圓仍可換美金一元，每二百元可換小黃魚一只，則人們自然就不再肯拿五千多金圓去買一千張錫箔，而改爲直接把鈔票燒給陰間的親人了。如此，中央銀行可以無形中收回（因爲別人替你燒掉了）大批通貨，而自己則絲毫不必拋出黃金或銀元，豈不一舉二得？</p>
<p>我想，這是並不難辦到的。中央銀行在目前的各處室外，可以立即設立起一個宣傳處來。在人事方面，首先聯絡全國各地的巫師巫婆，以及和尙道士等人，積極宣傳陰間爲統一幣制自本年三月間已一律採用金圓券爲唯一合法的通貨，其餘所有錫箔，長錠，紙銀洋等等，已一律不用。你如果要燒些錢給陰間的祖宗或親人化用，惟一的辦怯是燒些金圓券給他們。並且聲明：陰間因爲是包龍圖在任閻王之職，動不動就要拿鍘刀來殺人，所以投機囤積之風絕跡，金圓的價値極高，燒這麼四五千，已經可以大派用塲了。</p>
<p>這個宣傳如果收效，在信佛信鬼的老婆婆們間普遍流行，人人照做，試想：在國家可省下了一批有用的物資——錫，而通貨則時發時燒，永遠不會因太多而膨脹，其利益如何，是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>而中央銀行也可以從此不必再拋售物資以抽緊銀根，因爲自然地，銀根可以被「燒」得很緊了。</p>

<p>秘魯某地有一種奇特的風俗，就是女人身上的裙子，假使穿破了，不准脫下來，只能再加一條新的上去。如此破一條，加添一條，一般富裕人家的女子，往往穿有十數條裙子之多。並且每當這女子碰見男子的時候，男子們必脫帽致敬，以示示尊祟。</p>
<p>在莫斯族中，如果一個妻子在結婚後不能生男孩子，她就得經由族長的特准，與她　來的丈夫離婚，再同另一個男子結婚；並且可以繼續她的一離一合，直等到她能生男孩子時，才開始與她最末了的一個丈夫正式稱爲永久的夫妻。</p>
<p>泰國人穿的褲子和圍裙，往往隨一星期的日子而更換其顏色的。星期日穿紅色，星期一穿黃色，星期二穿桃紅色，星期三穿綠色，星期四穿淡灰色，星期五穿羽灰色，星期六穿紫色。他們認爲天上的星有七色，人間的星宿也有七色，故日月配合天上的星的色調更換，以求多福。逢葬喪時則穿白色，同我國人一樣。</p>

<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>一度有人稱上海爲東方的巴黎。從兩地房荒的情形來說，的確是頗相似的。</p>
<p>巴黎的工人一個月所付的房租，不過一元美金。足供一家六口居住的房子，月租二元（相當於十一包最便宜香烟的價格）。中等的，有三四個大房間的公寓，月租一元半到兩元半美金。闊佬們住的房子，也不過月租三兀半到十元左右美金而已。</p>
<p>房租低廉對於房客當然是喜訊，而巴黎的房荒，也日益嚴重，隨便那兒都是客滿。差不多在過去十二年中，巴黎沒有造過新房子。</p>
<p>唯一找房屋的機會，是等候孤單的老房客死掉，然後立即搬進去住。如果花錢頂一間公寓房子，就需五百元到一千五百元美金。</p>
<p>巴黎共約有八萬四千座各式住宅，其中百分之九十以上是第一次世界大戰以前蓋的。其中至少有一萬六千座已是衰老不堪，應該拆毀重造的。但其餘的房屋也並非儘合標準。百分之八十二的巴黎房屋，是沒有浴室的，有一半以上沒有衛生設備，甚至有五分之一的房子沒有自來水。</p>

<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>有句俗語說：「勤剃頭，懶洗浴。」可是一般人的感覺却相反，洗澡遍體舒暢，有無窮樂趣；，惟理髮一事，往往視爲畏述，能拖總想再拖幾天。頭髮長些尙不妨事，但若于思滿面，走到人前，總覺有些不大雅觀。雖有自備剃刀修面，但刀鋒既銳利，而又無理髮師的高明手段，偶一不愼，便有流血之禍，在這種情形下，終於產生了保安剃刀。</p>
<p>保安剃刀發明於一八八〇年，是移居美國的德籍三弟兄所創製。刀的形式像一把鋤頭，刀片是一面開口的，稱爲「星牌剃刀」出來後沒有幾年，頗受人歡迎，奪去了許多理髮店的生意。於是「琪姆」和「美國」兩種剃刀，不久亦相繼間世，成爲鼎足而三的局面。</p>
<p>那時保安剃刀雖已相當流行，但並不晋遍。一直到一九〇三年吉利剃刀產生後，銷路大盛。一包包的刀片，好像一包包的口香糖一樣，成爲家喻戶曉的東西。吉利剃刀的首創者，就是包紙上那個顯像「台利」。他原是勃洛克林的一個推銷員，却有發明的雄心。他終日找尋日常生活中需要的東西，用小紙片一件件記下來，照字母的次序排列着，發明的幻想，簡直是使他廢寢忘食。</p>
<p>一天早晨，吉利正在盥洗，站在鏡子前，拿着剃刀修面。那剃刀已失去了銳利的刀鋒，他弟得很疼。忽然靈機一動，他想用很薄的鋼片製成一把刀片，兩邊都很鋒利的，配上架子，應用起來必可以非常便利。於是他立即到五金店裏去買了一條鐘上做發條的鋼片，用老虎鉗和別的簡單工具，做成了一片樣子。他的朋友人人譏笑他，許多刀剪廠裏的人，也都勸他打消這種　主意。</p>
<p>但吉利不受別人的勸吿，他相信鋼皮是可以做刀片的，祗要技術上加以改良。他仍是繼續研究，一面設法凑集資本。六年後，他找到了二十個人，請他們孤注一擲地每人拿出二百五十美元。這每人二百五十兀的股本，幾年後已値到六萬二千五百元了。</p>
<p>吉利就憑這五千兀的資本，買了機器，在一家魚舖子樓上，開始製造他的新出品，到一九〇三年，刀片成功了，但公司却負了債，工人已兩星期不發工資。那時吉利另外找到了一個老闆，肯投資六萬兀，但須有全廠的管理權，吉利勉强地接受了下來。在一九〇三年，賣掉了五十柄保安刀，售價每柄五元。到第二年，銷數己是九萬多了。第三年，銷收增加到廿七萬多把。</p>
<p>吉利刀片成功後，銷數一年比一年增加。一九〇五年，設立倫敦辦事處。翌年，運銷遍及歐洲。一九一五年，老人牌刀片上市，用種種方怯推銷，想取吉利刀片而代之。如今，老人牌刀片也很流行了，可是吉利刀片仍未受多少影響。</p>
<p>吉利刀片的盛行，一半是靠了他的專利權。因吉利製成了兩邊開口的刀片後，獲得了十七年的專利權，使其他廠商，只能製造一邊鋒利的刀片。沒有人和他競爭，所以他能够一帆風順。到一九二一年，吉利刀片的專利權滿期了，別種牌子的雙面刀片，風起雲湧，當時日本貨的刀片，就有好多種運到芝加哥。吉利公司也知道這一點，在那一年，他們另外做了一種更美觀的新樣十，售價較前更便宜。這樣一來，使新牌子的產品不能立足，而吉利却又賺了更多的錢。</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Cabinet Actively Planning Peace Talks; Delegation Expected to Go to Peiping Early Next Month; Will First Discuss Most Fundamental Issues <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanking, 22nd] Peace negotiations with the Chinese Communists are clearly the most pressing issue for the current government and the people. Since the announcement of the new cabinet's formation, Acting President and Premier Ho Ying-chin have been busy preparing on the 22nd. It is reported that if things proceed quickly, the delegation is expected to go to Peiping in early April. An authoritative source said that this delegation will be responsible for substantive negotiations, the situation being similar to the Double Tenth talks in the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], with the Kuomintang and the Communists each sending representatives to first discuss the most fundamental issues and decide on matters concerning the civil war, then convene a new Political Consultative Conference (PCC) and invite third-party figures to participate, jointly discussing all political issues after peace. The government representatives, accepting their mission to Peiping, will not attend with full power of representation, that is, when each issue is discussed to the final stage, they will reserve the right to sign, deciding after reporting to Nanking in Peiping. This approach will benefit both the representatives and the government. As for the underlying principles of this trip to Peiping for negotiations, they are based on the peace outline drafted by the Ten-Person Committee, which in turn was based on Mao Zedong's eight conditions. However, the current peace outline is still a draft and needs to be revised and improved. An authoritative source expressed concern about this, because some pro-war figures, such as so-and-so, believe that basing it on the eight conditions is unacceptable, and if that is the case, there will inevitably be many hidden reefs in the future peace talks. When the reporter discussed the issue of abolishing the constitution and legal system with an authoritative source, he said that the most reasonable approach is to establish another institution after the future new PCC is convened, to convene a new National Assembly to undertake the revision of the new constitution. Regarding the reorganization of the army, the source expressed the opinion that we ultimately want to adopt the army reorganization model of Shenyang, Changchun, and Tianjin, or the army reorganization model of Peiping. Moreover, a comprehensive peace negotiation must be better than the army reorganization of Peiping. The source further commented on the current situation, saying that many pro-war figures clearly do not believe that their own strength is sufficient to defeat the other side and advocate war. Being unable to continue fighting is a fact, so peace negotiations should begin immediately. The source especially said that in the current peace talks, the government must obviously make concessions, because the conditions of the Communist authorities are very clear. The Communists are waiting for the government to sue for peace, so in future negotiations, there will inevitably be some issues that government officials consider inappropriate, but peace talks are inevitable, a fact, and the future of peace talks is bleak, which cannot be denied.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Twenty-One Legislators' Emergency Motion; Request the Government to Urge the Communists; To Quickly Send Representatives and Designate a Location <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanking, 22nd] The Legislative Yuan passed a resolution on the afternoon of the 22nd, urging the government to telegram the Communists to quickly send representatives and designate a location to begin peace talks. The motion was proposed by Yang Bu-ping and twenty-one others as a temporary emergency motion, and there were no opponents in the entire session. The motion included two supplementary measures, one being that the government should quickly strengthen the delegation of peace talks, and the other being that the government should immediately telegram the Communists to send representatives and designate a location to begin peace talks. Someone said that the word "strengthen" in "strengthen the delegation of peace talks" was inappropriate. The chairman then announced that the motion was passed without objection, and appointed five members, along with the original proposers, to be responsible for organizing the text and report to the next Yuan meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanking, 22nd] It is reported that Acting President Li's representative in Peiping, Huang Chi-han, today communicated with the President's Office via wireless telephone, urging the appointment of a peace delegation as soon as possible. Huang said he believed the Communists were preparing to start negotiations and were only waiting for the appointment of the government's peace delegation.</p>
<p>###傅秉常's Remarks</p>
<p>Undecided Whether to Take Office as Foreign Minister</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] I recently interviewed Ambassador Fu Bing-chang, who said that he was not aware of his appointment as foreign minister beforehand, and only learned of it this morning after receiving notification from the new Premier of the Executive Yuan, Ho Ying-chin. He is still considering this new position and has not yet decided whether to accept it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanking, 22nd] Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shao Lizi told reporters on the 22nd regarding Fu Bing-chang's appointment as foreign minister: Fu has been stationed in the Soviet Union for five or six years and is extremely familiar with the Soviet Union's political situation and its attitude towards China. Fu's appointment as foreign minister will surely enable us to achieve a balance in our diplomatic policies towards the United States and the Soviet Union. Regarding the rumor that Shao will succeed Fu after Fu returns to China, the reporter asked Shao about this. According to Shao: The authorities have not mentioned this matter to me, but someone mentioned it to me before. I am unwilling to consider it before the national policy is decided. Shao's words indicate that if the national policy is anti-Soviet, he does not intend to consider this matter. If the national policy changes to emphasize both the United States and the Soviet Union, Shao should consider it. Premier Ho telegraphed Fu Bing-chang on the 21st, urging him to return to China to take office immediately, while the affairs of the embassy will be temporarily handled by the counselor of the embassy. Fu's return to China is expected in a week at the earliest, and half a month at the latest.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 22nd] According to Gansu Chairman Guo Jijiang's words to the reporter: The rumor that the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters will move to Chengdu is purely groundless.

<h3 id="e5">General Labor Union Requests Restoration of Social Administration Organizations <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 22nd] An Tingfu, Managing Director of the National Confederation of Trade Unions of the Republic of China, declared at a press conference held in Nanking on the afternoon of the 22nd that the 5 million workers across the country opposed the abolition of the Ministry of Social Affairs in the Legislative Yuan's passage of the bill to simplify the structure of the Executive Yuan. He said that the Ministry of Social Affairs is the government's leading agency for social administration. In the past, the national labor movement relied on its leadership. After the abolition of this agency, the direction of the labor movement will lose its basis. According to the Legislative Yuan's bill to simplify the structure of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs will be abolished and merged into the Ministry of Interior. An Tingfu pointed out that this is a sign that the government does not attach importance to the social movement. At a time when democratic freedom is fighting against class dictatorship and the system of enslaving the people, the social movement is extremely important. He further stated that the National Confederation of Trade Unions, in accordance with the request of the national labor force, requests the government to restore the establishment of a social administration agency in the Executive Yuan. Shui Xiangyun and other Managing Directors of the National Confederation of Trade Unions separately petitioned Acting President Li, Premier Ho, and President Tong on the 22nd regarding this matter, and the heads of each state expressed that they would consider this issue.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 22nd] The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Trade Unions telegraphed the central government on the 22nd, requesting the establishment of a Ministry of Labor.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Democratic Socialist Party held its 47th Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday, deciding not to participate in the Executive Yuan. The meeting was chaired by Xu Fulin, who read out Premier Ho's original letter inviting members to join the cabinet, and then discussed whether to participate in the Executive Yuan. Jiang Yuntian first reported on his visit to Nanking to meet Acting President Li and Premier Ho, and then the discussion began. It was generally agreed that Ho Ying-chin's appointment as Premier of the Executive Yuan was the most appropriate choice, but the organization of the new cabinet did not yet have the basis for cooperation among the parties, so it was not planned to participate. However, Zhang Junmai, due to the sincere invitation of Acting President Li and Premier Ho, still intends to go to Nanking in the short term if his health improves. The Democratic Socialist Party also issued a declaration on the current situation with the establishment of the new cabinet, stating its position and appealing to both sides to abandon old grievances and seek a rational and emotional solution in a calm and peaceful spirit. It should not have preconceived notions of good or bad towards any friendly country, respect our independence, value our sovereignty, and be harmonious and friendly, without any distinction, to avoid the international future war from entering a whirlpool.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 22nd] According to the observation of a military authority: As of today, the Communist army has not shown any active signs of attacking the southern section of the Peiping-Hankou Railway. Even the Communist army moving south to eastern Hubei has not exceeded 30,000 people. Therefore, the current situation in central China has not been severely threatened. General observations outside may be overly sensitive.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 22nd] Military news: Under the command of General Zhang Zhen, a certain powerful unit, in coordination with a certain regiment of Unit "3677", captured Luo Mountain County at 5:00 PM yesterday. The more than 1,000 Communist troops in the city have been driven away.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 22nd] Military news: More than 20,000 troops from Liu Bocheng's Communist army, gathered in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border region, are moving towards Luotian and Yingshan in eastern Hubei. A portion of Chen Geng's corps, concentrated in Shangcheng, Gushi, Huangchuan, and Guangshan in southern Henan, is moving southeast. It is reported that this Communist army may establish an advanced base in the Dabie Mountain area to attack Wuhan and prepare to cross the Yangtze River on the north bank of eastern Hubei. The transportation platoons continuously driving south along the Xin (Cai)-Huang (Chuan) highway in recent days have mostly arrived in Gushi. Two or three detachments of Liu's army are currently stationed there, training very diligently.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 21st] Two thousand vehicles of the Communist army's baggage train, full of war materials, were found on the Xincai to Guangshan highway, heading towards the Henan-Hubei border, including two tanks.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 21st] After the National Army strengthened its defenses in the southern section of the Peiping-Hankou Railway, the local Communists near Guangshui Xiaogan have all fled east. When the reporter inspected Guangshui, he witnessed that the people in the area</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hankou, 22nd] The future of the National Government, the determination of its fate, seems to be currently in concentrating its best troops, under the command of General Bai Chongxi, in the Wuhan area. General Bai will defend his troops at the intersection of the Yangtze River and the Yuehan Railway, waiting for the progress of the Communist army, or convene peace talks. According to observers: He is very willing for the peace talks to be held, because his strength is not enough to make him win a decisive victory, but it allows him to occupy an important position in the peace talks. He seems to have deployed his troops and can command the provinces within his power. For example, Zhang Gan commands the military north of Wuhan, Xia Wei is stationed in Anqing, and Zhang Zhen commands the military in southern Henan. After the adjustment of the armies by Bai Chongxi in mid-February, it seems that he has greatly consolidated his position. According to military experts: General Bai Chongxi's army has about 150,000 local troops and 150,000 national troops, distributed along the 700-kilometer area along the Yangtze River and controlling the 250-kilometer Peiping-Hankou Railway. The National Army, especially the most elite Guangxi Army, is well-equipped, including several divisions that are fully motorized and equipped with American equipment. Military personnel in Hankou believe that although Lin Biao's Communist army has appeared in the area south of Xuzhou, they believe that a general offensive by the Communist army may not be possible for the time being. Although eliminating an army commanded by Bai would be a major loss for the National Army, the price for the Communist Party would also be very high. So far, the Communist army has only conducted small-scale reconnaissance battles in the area downstream of Wuhan. It is heard that a Communist army column has gone to Macheng, sixty kilometers east of Hankou. According to military sources, its purpose is only to scout the area along the Yangtze River in northern Hubei. The other 200,000 regular Communist troops in southern Henan are holding against Bai Chongxi's army without any action. Although there is war in the east of the Peiping-Hankou Railway, commerce has not stopped. In 1948, 80 million pounds of tobacco were still transported from the Communist area of Henan Province to Hubei in exchange for agricultural products. According to recent news, barter trade is taking place under the permission of the generals of both sides.</p>

According to information up to the 19th, in addition to the southward movement of the 13th Column being confirmed, the military has also determined the positions of the Liangguang and 9th Columns based on intelligence. Counting the units found in the past, the main force of the Communist army east of the Grand Canal line, west of the Tongyu line, and south of the Dongtai Taixian Yangzhou line has reached more than eight columns. According to National Army returnees, the Communist army has reorganized these more than eight columns into three corps, namely the 7th, 9th, and 10th Corps. Among them, the 9th Corps governs the 1st, 4th, and 9th Columns, and the 10th Corps governs the 10th, 11th, 12th, and Liangguang Columns. The serial numbers of the units under the command of the 3rd Corps are still under investigation. The location of the headquarters of the three corps is approximately in Zhaixian, Rugao, and Nantong. The positions of the columns are as follows: The 1st Column is between Yiling and Xiannvmiao, west of Taixian. A follow-up unit of this unit is on the line from Xiannvmiao north to Shaobo. According to prisoners, this unit will still move towards Taixian. The 4th Column is on the Hekou Taixian line. The 9th Column is between Jingjiang and Xinzhen (about 30 li south of Taixing). The 10th Column is in Huangqiao, Taixing. The 11th Column is still in the north and south of Rugao. The 12th Column has reached near Nantong. The Liangguang Column is going north along the Tongyu line and has reached Fuan, Dongtai (about 30 li northeast of Hai'an). This unit was originally stationed in Huaiyin. The more than 20,000 people discovered by the Air Force previously should be this unit. The Changjiang Column is still divided into two parts, one stationed in Nantong and the other stationed in Jiangyan. As for the unconfirmed 13th Column, it is said to have been transferred to the line between Shizhuang (about 50 li south of Rugao) and Jijiashi (about 20 li northeast of Jingjiang).

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 22nd] After the Communist army's organization changed from "column" to "army," the military here has learned the new serial numbers of the three Communist army columns in northern Jiangsu. The 1st Column has been changed to the 20th Army, the 4th Column has been changed to the 23rd Army, and the 13th Column has been changed to the 31st Army.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Legislative Yuan Discusses Financial Issues: Yang Baodong Proposes Issuing National Salvation Public Bonds, Readjustment of Railway Freight Rates and Postal and Telegraph Rates Referred for Re-Examination <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The seventh meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 a.m. on the 22nd. Chairman Tong Guanxian announced the report matters: "The President's communication that the Executive Yuan submitted a request to promulgate the financial reform plan based on the Temporary Provisions of the Constitution, which has been promulgated by this government, is submitted for your information." This immediately aroused opposition from some members, who believed that the implementation of the reform plan was harmful and not beneficial to the people's livelihood, and the Legislative Yuan could not remain silent. It was decided to discuss it together with the "Request to the government to promptly change and correct the financial reform plan" proposed by Zhu Huiqing. Then, the discussion matters proceeded. Regarding the Executive Yuan's submission of the review opinions on the method of adjusting railway, postal, and telegraph rates and fees according to the cost index, as well as related implementation methods and trial operation situations, the members raised various opinions. The review opinion advocates that railway freight rates and telegraph fees should be based on the "August 19th" price as the basis, and calculated according to the government's announced cost of living index for civil servants. Adjustments to postal rates must be implemented only after discussion by the Legislative Yuan. It is proposed that the price increase be implemented from April 1st. Opponents said that the original method proposed by the Executive Yuan was based on scientific methods, while the review opinion ignored this point. The prices of transportation undertakings should take into account the materials required and the costs. The price difference between the review opinion and the original proposal is too large, and for the sake of prudence, this case should be referred for re-examination. The meeting passed a resolution to have the original review team conduct the review. The discussion continued on Yang Baodong's proposal to issue special national salvation public bonds to stabilize the currency system and prices, establish economic credibility, and stabilize social life, in order to save the country from its difficulties. The opinion of the Procedure Committee was to hand it over to the Finance Committee for review, but the majority of the members advocated retention. After a vote, although a majority of 103 people agreed to retain it, because there were only 142 people present, which was less than the legal quorum, it was changed to be voted on again in the afternoon. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 p.m. The afternoon session continued, and the legal quorum was only reached at 4:00 p.m., and the discussion on the issuance of national salvation public bonds continued. Some people advocated that there was no need to retain it and that it could be handed over for review. After a vote was proposed, it was found that there were only 13 members present, which was less than the legal quorum, and no vote could be taken. It was decided to leave it for the next meeting. Afterwards, the discussion was on Kong Geng and others' proposal to re-amend the standard for clearing bank deposits in war zones, Li Shijun and others' proposal to the Executive Yuan to quickly form a national property inventory organization to conduct a thorough investigation in groups, Meng Yunqiao and others' proposal to simplify provincial-level administrative agencies, and Wang Zemin and others' proposal to formulate a reform plan based on facts. All were passed without objection and handed over to the relevant committees for review according to the opinion of the Procedure Committee. The remaining cases were not discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The Procedure Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting at 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd to discuss the agenda for the next meeting. In addition to the five cases that were not fully discussed at the Yuan meeting on the 22nd, the newly listed items include Tang Siyao and others' proposal to organize a political research committee for innovation to innovate political affairs (to be discussed together with the outline for political innovation). Zhang Jingyu and others proposed amending the Central Bank Law to meet the current needs, so as to rectify the bank and seek financial stability. Lian Mou and others proposed that the temporary measures for military and public personnel and tourists entering Taiwan Province violate the Constitution, deprive people of their freedom of residence, movement, and action, restrict traffic, divide unity, and should be submitted to the Executive Yuan for repeal to facilitate merchants and travelers, etc. (There is also news about the Legislative Yuan on page 2)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Editorial: He Cabinet's Financial Policy <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The He cabinet, which the whole country has been anticipating, was born on the 21st after a week of preparation. The heads of the eight ministries and one commission, as well as the seven ministers without portfolio, have also been appointed and announced by Acting President Li. Looking at the lineup of the He cabinet, it seems to have made significant progress and has a new atmosphere, which naturally increases the people's expectations for the He cabinet, which is not surprising. According to our newspaper's Nanjing report, the He cabinet is scheduled to hold its first joint cabinet meeting in the coming days to discuss the new cabinet's policy guidelines. It is said that the main points are to earnestly promote the following four goals: (1) Seek peace; (2) Political innovation; (3) Stabilize the economy; (4) Secure people's livelihood.</p>
<p>These four policy guidelines, judging from the words, are exactly what the people urgently expect from the government. In today's gloomy political atmosphere, the guiding principles of Xuanzheng really do not need to be high-sounding. Rather than aiming too high and talking empty words, and issuing checks that cannot be cashed, which only disappoint the people, it is better to be practical and say things honestly and do things earnestly. "Where there's a will, there's a way." As long as there is sincerity and perseverance, any difficulty can be overcome. Taking these four policy guidelines as an example, this newspaper has repeatedly discussed seeking peace and innovation, and this article does not want to add anything. However, regarding the two items of stabilizing the economy and securing people's livelihood, we cannot but point out that this is where President He's unique insight lies.</p>
<p>At the beginning of President He's mission to form a cabinet, he had long had the intention of taking the social policies implemented by the British Labour Party cabinet as an example. Because after the victory against Japan, President He was ordered to go abroad to participate in the United Nations Chiefs of Staff meeting, and he must have had a deep understanding of the democratic system and social policies of Britain and the United States. This time, as the premier of the Executive Yuan, he will surely be able to implement the economic policies of the Three People's Principles to fulfill his long-cherished wish. At the same time, we must also point out that today's Chinese people, affected by currency inflation, are living in deep water and burning fire. Once they hear that President He's policy guidelines are to stabilize the economy and secure people's livelihood, it is like hearing the gospel, who would not cheer and rejoice? The problem in the future lies in how to realize this stability and security.</p>
<p>Standing in the position of the people, we cannot but pay special attention to the new financial policies of the He cabinet. Under the current situation, whether it is the national finance or the personal economy, it is almost at the end of its rope, but it may not be without a new realm of bright prospects. In the past two months, prices have indeed been rising, but if the former Finance Minister Xu Kan had not resolutely taken out his set of methods to deal with the emergency, I am afraid that there would not be such tranquility today. It is said that after the new Finance Minister Liu Gongyun takes office, he will make further improvements to the current measures to remedy the defects and formulate a new set of methods. Naturally, we hope that the methods will become better and better, so that the people's lives can be relieved. In terms of the talents of the new cabinet, Finance Minister Liu is the current president of the Central Bank, and can also be said to be the current de facto finance minister. The current finance seems to have not seen new measures other than throwing gold to inflate prices, buying and selling foreign exchange certificates, and printing a large amount of banknotes, which shows that the real power of finance is in the hands of the Central Bank. Therefore, Finance Minister Liu's financial policy will probably not have a major turnaround of eighty or ninety degrees. As for the Minister of Economic Affairs, Sun Yueqi, he is also the original director of the Resources Committee, and of course there are old chapters to follow. With the recommendation of Zhang Jia'ao and Weng Wenhao, Liu and Sun took the stage and should display their new plans to comfort the people's expectations.</p>
<p>Some may think that the current financial policy will undergo fundamental changes. "Change when you are poor" is certainly a good phenomenon, but the most important thing is to "get through when you change," and not to make things worse by changing. When President Bao arrived in Beijing from Shanghai, he told reporters: "I am like a blank sheet of paper when it comes to economic policy." This can indeed show President He's humble attitude, but it is also enough to show that President He still needs experts to study and draft a complete set of methods for the current economic crisis. We do not know what the new cabinet's methods will be today, but there is a general saying that the way to save the economic crisis, in addition to paying attention to the branch and leaf problems, the most important thing is to establish the general policy of "making the rich pay." If it cannot be taken from the rich and used for the common people, then not only will "economic equality" not be achieved, but the goal of "economic socialization" will not be achieved, and the current national treasury revenue and expenditure will inevitably be countless. There is no way to save the current economic crisis, let alone restore the people's lost hearts. What the people of the whole country expect from the He cabinet to use new people to implement new policies is mainly this point. Therefore, how the new financial plan is not only can show whether the He cabinet's policy guidelines are heading towards the goal of improving people's livelihood, but also the quality of the He cabinet can be seen from here.</p>
<h3 id="e18">The Fire on the Chongqing Warship is Extinguished: The Air Force Flew to Huludao Again Yesterday for Reconnaissance: The Eighth Squadron Completed its Mission and Returned to Beijing <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] At 9:00 a.m. on the 22nd, an air force reconnaissance plane went to the sky over Huludao again to investigate the situation of the Chongqing warship. The pilot of the plane, Hu Cuiting, made his third flight to Huludao. According to what he saw, the bottom of the warship was turned over even more severely. The part of the oil depot that caught fire burned for two days and two nights. With the intrusion of seawater, the fire was extinguished, and Huludao was unusually quiet. Mr. Hu mentioned that when he flew over the warship in Huludao on the 18th and 19th, he saw flashes of light on the ship (the muzzle flashes of the intense anti-aircraft fire). The sky was filled with exploding shells, and the island clouds showed one ball after another. It was truly a tense war scene. When the aircrew went to bomb for the third time on the 20th, the ship did not react to the artillery fire. Even the five anti-aircraft guns on land in Huludao were withdrawn, fearing that they would be affected. Mr. Hu originally wanted to go with his wife Gao Xuemei to watch the movie "Snow in Red", but missed the show because he talked to the reporter about the situation in Huludao.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 22nd] The Eighth Squadron of the Acting Army, led by Commander Chen Jiashang, returned to Beijing on the morning of the 21st.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Military personnel added comments on the Battle of Chongqing: The Battle of Chongqing shows that naval warships have no aircraft protection. Once they encounter air raids, they will inevitably go to destruction. If the Communist Party had fighters this time, they would definitely use them to prevent the National Army bomber group from approaching. Because the Communist Army lacks air force, the bombing of Chongqing is still a test of pure bombing technology and accuracy. Also because the Communist Army has no air force, the planes that went to bomb were able to form a formation to fly to the sky over Huludao and then enter with a single plane from the air to drop bombs. Furthermore, because the bombing technology was sophisticated, and each bomb used created a 30-foot diameter crater, the damage to the ship's surface was too great (the Chongqing's deck was only 51 feet wide), so the Chongqing was hit by bullets, caught fire and exploded, tilted and turned over, and then it was inevitable that it would sink. However, because the general understanding of the role of the air force is not very clear, after the Chongqing was bombed, the general response was alarming. In fact, those who understand the power of the air force had long expected this ordinary ending after the Chongqing slipped away.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Legislators Demand that Responsible Authorities Report on the Chongqing Warship Incident and Explain the Disappearance of Wang Lingyun <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Legislators attach importance to the defection of the Chongqing warship to the Communist Party. At the Yuan meeting on the morning of the 22nd, Li Xiongxian proposed a temporary emergency motion, requesting that the military responsible authorities come to the Yuan in the morning to report. The motion stated: "It is found that Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, confirmed at a press conference on the morning of the 17th of this month that the cruiser Chongqing has shared the Communist Army, and said that the reasons for the mutiny are complicated, and dissatisfaction with the treatment is one of them, etc. In such a major situation, the Minister of National Defense should be requested. Chief of Staff. The Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, etc., will come to this Yuan to attend the Yuan meeting this morning to report on the reasons and responsibilities for the defection of the cruiser Chongqing." After the case was filed, Chairman Tong Guanxian said: The new cabinet has just been formed, and the heads of various ministries and commissions have not yet taken office. Can this case be postponed to the 25th before it is raised again? With the consent of the original mover, it was changed to be discussed again on the 25th. The case incidentally mentioned the Commander Wang Lingyun of the Sui District, who "disappeared" in Zhijiang, and also asked the military authorities to explain. According to reports: "It is also heard that Wang Lingyun, commander of the 13th Pacification District, has disappeared. The details of his disappearance should also be reported at the same time, so that everyone can understand the actual situation on the military side recently. Please question the amount of mass at that time, and trace the whereabouts of various incidents."</p>

The conversation lasted nearly three hours. Gui said that he was determined not to shirk the responsibilities he should bear, and had asked the Ministry of National Defense to punish him. As for the reasons for the defection, it would be nothing more than the crew's emotional distress and the hardship of treatment. In the future, he would try to avoid the re-enactment of the battle to avoid making historical mistakes and regrets. Gui was very painful when he spoke on the 22nd, and almost burst into tears when he spoke of sadness. The two members of the Supervisory Committee investigated the situation of the officers and soldiers of the Chongqing warship in detail, and Gui answered them one by one.

For those cases that have not been closed, they have been transferred to the courts or ordered to be defended, depending on the severity of the circumstances. Since last September, the Supervisory Yuan has sent a total of 45 impeachment cases, all of which have not been closed. The reasons for the failure to close the cases are five: (1) The defense of the impeached person has not yet been sent, (2) Investigations have been made to various local governments, but no signed reply has been received, (3) Cases with serious circumstances have been transferred to the courts for handling, (4) Some cases have been withdrawn by the Supervisory Yuan, (5) The defense statement has arrived, but is still under review. I only took office in January. After taking office, I was ordered to evacuate, and I had no time to close the cases that should be handled as soon as possible. I am now ordering my subordinates to rush to handle the cases. After Xie's report, Jin Yueguang, Liu Pingjiang, Zhang Dinghua, Sun Yulin, Ye Shixiu, Chen Yunguo and others spoke, expressing dissatisfaction with the slowness of the Disciplinary Committee's handling of An, the low work efficiency, and hoped that they would be improved soon and close contacts with the Supervisory Yuan would be established.

<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 22nd] According to the first British shipowner to return here from North China on the 22nd, the reporter said: The seaport controlled by the CCP—Tianjin is currently in a state of paralysis due to "slow work by the masses," and this labor tide is a protest against the CCP's rule. The British shipowner also quoted CCP officials as saying that the CCP is not prepared to make a dispute over the recovery of Dalian and Lushun ports controlled by the Soviet Union. The CCP will use passive resistance and obstruction to put the Soviet Union in a difficult position to defend. The British shipowner is a former British naval commander. When he revealed this news to reporters, he attached a condition that his name and the name of the ship should not be disclosed.</p>
<p>The shipowner also said that all industries in Tianjin are "completely stagnant," and all foreign-owned businesses and factories are closed, and it seems that there is no hope of recovery in the near future. The CCP authorities in Tianjin are of no help to the unemployed. Therefore, Tianjin is a liability rather than an asset to the CCP. The CCP authorities, officials and soldiers have good discipline. His ship experienced many difficulties in Tianjin. For example, before sailing upstream the river, it was detained at Tangyuangu for three days. Before being allowed to enter the Haihe River through Xingang, it was delayed for another twelve days. When the ship was sailing from upstream to Tianjin, gunshots were heard on both sides of the river, but it could not be proved whether the shooting was directed at the ship. The ship left the port and went north last month and arrived here on the 21st.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Mu Chao, Xiong Aigao, and other Guangzhou-based legislators arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd aboard a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. When reporters inquired about the Guangzhou-based legislators' opinions on the current situation, Mr. Mu stated: (1) The Guangzhou-based legislators strongly support Acting President Li's proposal for preparing for war while seeking peace, but they oppose unreasonable and unequal peace. (2) The Guangzhou-based legislators firmly advocate unity and have no intention of putting on a "show against Taiwan." Many outside reports are inaccurate. The Guangzhou-based legislators' dispute over the location for the resumption of the third session lies in their insistence that the decision should be made by a majority of the legislators. (3) Because Nanjing is close to the front lines and under constant threat from the Japanese, the Guangzhou-based legislators have prepared food and lodging for the Nanjing legislators, welcoming them to move to Guangzhou to continue the session. (4) Regarding the peace terms, the Guangzhou-based legislators generally advocate dividing the country along the Yangtze River, with both sides ceasing military operations to allow the war-weary people to catch their breath. While they support amending the constitution, they insist on retaining the Three Principles of the People and the Republic of China. On the issue of military reorganization, they advocate the nationalization of the army. They are concerned about changing the people's way of life.</p>

The legislators almost unanimously agreed with this opinion, believing that legislators should maintain their integrity and not accept such gifts. Even if the reports are unreliable, this determination should still be made to set the record straight, especially when legislators are discussing railway fare adjustments. One legislator also mentioned recently receiving a notice from the Legislative Yuan Secretariat stating that the Ministry of Communications had deemed the request to issue free train tickets to legislators unfeasible. He stated that he did not know who had ordered the Secretariat to make the request, and he believed that this action was inappropriate.

The above three points have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and have been contracted with the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance. From now on, the financial problem that the judicial circle feels the most painful has been completely solved.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] New York 22nd Broadcasting: Copenhagen News, The Danish government assured the parliament today that when the North Atlantic Treaty signatory countries are attacked, the United States will immediately go to war. Today, Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen told the parliament when requesting authorization from the government to sign the North Atlantic Treaty: "If the signatory countries of the treaty encounter armed attacks, the only consequence is: the United States will go to war. The Danish government is certain that the United States has provided its commitment." All military force to assist the attacked country" But Mr. Lai also said that the US Constitution and the Danish Constitution have the same point, that is, the declaration of war must first be approved by the parliament. Mr. Lai also announced that he had discussed the status of the Geeling Chan base with Secretary of State Acheson in Washington. Mr. Ai strongly requested that if this base is used, it will be purely for defensive purposes and will never be used for offensive purposes. Mr. Lai denied the rumor that the Danish government is willing to sell Luoling Er in exchange for artillery, and said, "We have not sold Geeling Pass, and Geeling is not for sale." In Mr. Lai's speech, some people in the gallery shouted "Long live the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 21st] The Senate debated the Atlantic Treaty today. Foreign Minister Sfuosa came to the meeting to defend the treaty, stating that if Italy wants to continue to work for peace and maintain its security, it has no other way but to participate in the Atlantic Treaty. After World War II, only the Western powers have disarmed, while the Soviet Union quickly colluded with Eastern European countries to establish military agreements with them. The agreements between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries and between Eastern European countries not only regard the actual aggression as the cause of the war, but also regard the threat of aggression as the cause of the war, and there are many flexibilities in interpreting these so-called threats. Therefore, since Eastern Europe has first formed a group, Western countries have to seek countermeasures. If the Soviet Union has no intention of dividing Europe, the Soviet Union can join the Marshall Plan from the beginning. Mr. Shi repeatedly emphasized that Italy has never received any request to establish a base in Italy, and the Italian government has never expressed its intention to supply a base. When Mr. Shi explained the relationship between Italy and the Atlantic Treaty, a communist member shouted "We have really entered heaven now." Mr. Shi immediately replied, "At least we have escaped from hell."</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Deputy Minister Meixiu told members of the House of Commons today that, to his knowledge, no regional convention other than the Atlantic Convention is under negotiation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] Washington political commentators do not believe the rumor that the US government will decide to establish the Pacific Convention immediately after the Senate approves the Atlantic Convention, saying that the United States has a number of military bases in the Pacific and its position in Japan is extremely solid. However, at present, the White House and the State Department hold a watchful policy towards the Far East, especially China, because the situation in China is in "flux."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The idea of establishing regional conventions around the world first became the basis for discussing long-term policies at the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Meeting in October last year. Today, due to the announcement of the Atlantic Convention and the victory of the Chinese Communist Party, all non-communist countries in the world have realized that it is impossible to stabilize their own position without establishing a collective regional security system to resist the continuous expansion of communist forces. After the failure of efforts to cooperate with the Soviet Union to rebuild the world after the war, the establishment of regional agreements began to brew. The first to become a reality was the Western European Union. The Atlantic Union is just to expand the Western European Union to both sides of the North Atlantic. The foundation work for regional agreements in the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia has also begun. During their recent visit to London, the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey outlined their views on the Mediterranean regional convention to the British Foreign Office. Turkish Foreign Minister Shadak believes that the Mediterranean Convention can be divided into two stages. The first stage includes the countries of Turkey, Greece, Italy, France, and Britain. The second step includes the countries around the Mediterranean. He believes that the Middle East situation must be stabilized before discussions on the regional convention including countries around the Mediterranean can begin. Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris believes that discussions on the Mediterranean Convention can begin immediately without delay. He also divides the establishment of the Mediterranean Convention into two stages: the first stage is the same as the Turkish Foreign Minister; the second stage, he advocates including the countries in the first stage as well as Iran, Pakistan, and the Arab countries. Although the United Kingdom expressed sympathy for the views of the two countries, it hoped that the Atlantic Convention would be approved before the Mediterranean Convention began negotiations. So far, the British government has not formally expressed whether it intends to join the Mediterranean Human Rights Convention as a Mediterranean power, which is an extremely important decision. The Mediterranean Convention hoped by the two Greek countries intends to use Britain as the key to linking the Mediterranean Convention and the Atlantic Convention. As far as the situation in Southeast Asia is concerned, although the United States has not been involved there, it seems to be very concerned about the conclusion of the Southeast Asia Regional Convention. The achievements of the CCP on the mainland of China and the suspicion of the strategic position of Japan by American strategists have made the United States feel the threat of the rapid expansion of communism. Due to the active communist forces in Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc., and the lurking crisis within the borders of Nepal, the British Commonwealth Conference convened by India in February to discuss the situation in Myanmar is of great significance. India's adoption of decisive measures against domestic communism shows that India is not only an anti-imperialist, but also a firm anti-communist country.</p>

<p>President Truman Requests Discretionary Power</p>
<p>[Washington, 21st (Reuters)] It is reported that as the military aid plan for Europe is presented to Congress, President Truman will request Congress to grant him broad discretionary power in deciding the allocation of military supplies to Europe. He hopes that Congress will not strictly stipulate the amount of aid to each country. He will request Congress to approve a total amount, and then, based on the State Department's recommendations, he will make the allocations himself. This system would allow for responses to any emergencies that may arise. It is currently estimated that this plan will cost between ten and fifteen billion dollars in the first year, with the hope of raising European military strength to an effective level within this range. Once the Atlantic Pact is submitted to Congress for approval at the beginning of next month, this military aid plan for Europe will be prepared for congressional review. Vincent, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, has indicated that the House is unlikely to object to the proposal.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] London, 22nd Broadcast: British representative Manjouk stated at the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers that Britain is increasingly losing patience with the tactics employed by the Soviet Union in discussing the Austrian peace treaty. Other Western representatives also accused the Soviet Union of simply delaying the current negotiations. They said that the Soviet representative, Sarupin, is using various tactics to avoid reaching a resolution and is prolonging the discussion at the end of the meeting without making any progress. Western representatives have learned that Mr. Sarupin has been appointed as the Soviet representative to the next United Nations General Assembly, but he has not informed the other representatives that he will be leaving in a few days. The Western representatives find it puzzling that Mr. Sarupin is simultaneously seeking to continue the meeting but is unwilling to make any concessions.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Results of French Provincial Council Elections Announced Last Night; Centrist Parties Achieve Major Victory; Second Round of Voting Scheduled for Sunday <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Paris, 21st (Associated Press)] The final results of the French local elections were announced tonight, with the parties supporting the centrist government of Guy Mollet winning. However, General de Gaulle achieved a personal victory record. De Gaulle's French People's Party received 25.34% of the total votes, the Communist Party received 23.54%, and the government parties received 51.12%.</p>
<p>Neutral observers say that Guy Mollet's moderate, pro-American government has strengthened its position through the first round of voting. Both de Gaulle's party and the Communist Party want to overthrow the current government, but they have different goals and hate each other, so both sides are suffering. Of the 1,508 local council seats, only 723 were won by a majority of votes this time, including 536 for the government parties, 170 for de Gaulle's party, and 17 for the Communist Party. The remaining 785 seats will be elected next Sunday among the candidates who received the second-most votes.</p>
<p>[Paris, 21st (Agence France-Presse)] The victory or defeat of each party in the election of local council representatives will depend on the results of the second round of voting to be held on Sunday. The statistical report from yesterday already offers a glimpse into the current trends of French political opinion. All parties that did not win are now saying that they are still confident of victory in the second round of voting. Observers emphasize that the French people are now mostly unwilling to be drawn into risky politics. The parties that were most popular before the war are now gradually recovering the positions they lost during the turbulent period after liberation. This is a victory for the centrist parties.</p>
<p>[Paris, 21st (Agence France-Presse)] The Communist Party issued a statement tonight stating that in the second round of voting for the French local elections on the 27th, Communist voters will only vote for candidates who have criticized the Atlantic Pact. The statement denounced the pact as an "important tool for preparing for World War III." The second round of voting will be held in areas where no candidate received a majority of votes in yesterday's election. In that election, only a majority was required.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Improvement in the Method of Compiling the Index; Three Items Decided in the Subcommittee Meeting of the Compilation and Review Committee; Quantities, Types, and Techniques Are All Revised <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Living Index Compilation and Review Subcommittee Meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room, chaired by Mr. Chu Yifei, Director of the Municipal Government Statistics Office. Attendees included Mr. Jin Runxiang and Mr. Tian Heqing from the Municipal Industrial Association, Mr. Liang Yongzhang, Mr. Fang Rusheng, and Mr. Sun Wenyuan from the General Labor Union, Mr. Wang Naixu from the Municipal Council, Mr. Liu Jingquan from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. Cao Peizi and Mr. Shen Ding from the Social Affairs Bureau. The meeting continued to discuss various issues related to the compilation of the index and adjourned at around 7:00 PM. Regarding the improvement of the compilation of the living index, three items were discussed and resolved as follows: (1) Quantity Issues - In the past, under the items for compiling the living index, some were calculated in a mixed way. A. For example, for 7.5 dou of rice, half was calculated at the subsidized price and the other half at the market price. From now on, it should be changed to calculate 2 dou at the subsidized price, and the rest at the market price. B. The cost of electricity was previously calculated at 10 degrees, now it should be changed to 30 degrees. C. The streetcar fare was previously calculated at the third-class fare, now it should be changed to the first-class fare. D. Rent should be adjusted once a month. (2) Type Issues - When the living index was previously published, it was divided into two types: for office workers and for laborers. Now that it has been merged into one type, the items originally under the office worker category, such as newspapers, movies, and long stockings, should still be included in the calculation. (3) Technical Issues - In the past, price surveys often became disconnected from market prices. This should be avoided as much as possible in the future. It was decided that the price survey dates for the first half of the month should be the 4th, 8th, 12th, and 14th. The dates for the second half of the month should be the 19th, 27th, and 30th. The above resolutions will be submitted to the Compilation and Review Committee for review and approval, and then submitted to the Mayor for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e87">It is Difficult for the Mayor to Resign Temporarily; He May Be Granted Leave <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, amidst widespread rumors that Mayor Wu Guozhen is determined to resign, there is still a glimmer of hope that could retain the Mayor, namely, temporarily granting him a leave of absence for one or two months. It is understood that various parties are currently making every effort to retain the Mayor, and the central government also believes that after approving Mr. Wu's resignation, it would be difficult to find a suitable successor in Shanghai under such difficult circumstances. Therefore, it is generally speculated that Mayor Wu's resignation is still unlikely to materialize. It is possible that he will temporarily take a leave of absence from April 1, and then return to Shanghai to continue serving the citizens. All those who care about Mr. Wu believe that the vacation is important for him. Curing malignant malaria is certainly the biggest reason, but the excessive fatigue of his political duties is also a fact. Since Mr. Wu has been the Mayor of Shanghai for three years, he has never had a proper vacation to separate himself from municipal affairs, and his mind and body are exhausted. If he does not rest in time, his physical strength will inevitably be unsustainable. As for the rumors that Mayor Wu will join the cabinet after his resignation, it is impossible. The reason why he is asking to resign is to seek an opportunity to rest. Considering the development of the situation, it is difficult to find a new mayor, so Mr. Wu's resignation is still unlikely to become a reality for the time being. However, it is possible that he will temporarily take leave from April 1 for a considerable period.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, has requested to resign due to hemoptysis, but his resignation has not been approved. Starting yesterday, Mayor Wu temporarily granted him five days of leave to recuperate. However, since the newly promoted Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, Mr. Qian Jianfu, was absent from the bureau due to the death of his father, Director Tian still went to the bureau to work. According to what Director Tian told reporters yesterday, his intention to resign has been decided, and he will follow the Mayor, whether it is approved or not. After the five-day leave is over, he will apply for another leave.</p>

<h3 id="e91">The Presidents of Major Colleges and Universities Collectively Telegraph the Ministry of Education Requesting Tuition Fee for Staff <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The presidents of various national colleges and universities in the Shanghai area, on behalf of their school staff, jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Education, stating: "The staff members of national colleges and universities in Shanghai have organized a fellowship association to appeal to the presidents of various institutions, roughly stating that the base salaries of general staff are relatively low, and they do not receive academic research funds or overtime pay, nor can they hold concurrent jobs or classes outside the school. They work diligently throughout the year, without winter or summer vacations. This time, the academic research fees for teachers have been generally increased to four levels: two hundred, one hundred fifty, one hundred, and fifty yuan. However, full-time staff members, in addition to their fixed salaries, do not receive any similar subsidies. Serving the school together, there is a significant difference in treatment, which is somewhat unfair. With meager salaries, it is truly impossible to support a family. Please consider issuing full-time staff members a 'tuition fee' in the name of academic advancement, referring to the amount of research funds received by lecturers and teaching assistants (i.e., fifty to one hundred yuan), to maintain their livelihoods, etc. The statements made are indeed factual. An investigation reveals that the number of full-time staff members in each school is relatively small, and the amount of tuition fees is not large. To avoid imbalance, it is indeed necessary to provide some assistance. We are forwarding this request and earnestly hope for your consideration and approval."</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Shanghai Area National College and University Staff Fellowship Association has approved the Henan University Staff Association as a member. Recently, it has received telegrams from the Hangzhou National Academy of Art and the Suzhou Social Education College applying for membership, which will be discussed at the next board meeting.</p>

<p>She Smiled Before Speaking, Her Situation Was Quite Mysterious</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday at 4:00 PM, a young woman named Ding Yonghui went to the City Government Building to see Mayor Wu and inquire about his health. The woman was wearing a dark green silk cheongsam, cloth shoes, and holding a National School Teacher Qualification Registration Certificate issued by the Bureau of Education. She went straight to the mayor's office but was stopped by the guards outside the mayor's office. She immediately presented the National School Teacher Certificate and asked the guards to forward it, saying that the mayor would definitely summon her after seeing the certificate. The guards accompanied her to the Protocol Section for consultation. According to the woman, she told the person in charge of the Protocol Section that she knew from the newspaper that Mayor Wu had contracted malignant malaria and missed him very much, so she came to visit him. The Protocol Section thought that the woman was not acquainted with the mayor and suspected that she was mentally disturbed by her words and actions, so they told her that the mayor was very busy at the moment and had no time to see her. However, the woman still refused to leave and sat quietly on the long bench outside the mayor's office. She waited there for half an hour and left in disappointment when she saw that no one was paying attention to her. When the reporter asked her what she wanted to see the mayor about, she replied, "Of course, I have something to say, but I can't tell you." She smiled before she spoke, and the smile was always on her face, looking very happy. The woman was about thirty years old, with a very upright appearance, and spoke in the Shaoxing dialect, so it is speculated that she might be from Shaoxing.</p>

It Is Hoped That the Difficult Situation Will Not Force Them to Make Further Statements. <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Area National College and University Professors Fellowship Association yesterday telegraphed the government again to appeal on the issue of livelihood. At the meeting of this association on the 14th of this month, the issues of organizing and dispatching representatives for petitions and joint strikes were discussed and decided to be temporarily reserved. Now that the new cabinet has been established, the association hopes that it can quickly seek a fundamental solution. The situation is difficult, and it is hoped that they will not be forced to make further statements. This will be discussed again at the meeting on the 27th.</p>
<p>The full text of the association's telegram to the government yesterday is as follows: "To Acting President Li, Premier He of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Kang of the Ministry of Education: We previously sent a telegram, which we believe has been noted, but we have not yet received a reply, and we are very apprehensive. Currently, prices are jumping several times a day. The cost of living index for workers in Shanghai has reached 1,339 times zero points in the first half of this month, and the price index has reached over 1,556 times. The salaries of our colleagues in February are only 75 times after a 24% discount, which is a huge difference. Even with the 500 times compensation that the presidents of various colleges and universities brought back to issue at the beginning of this month after a 24% discount, it is still insufficient. This month will soon be over, and the salaries of our colleagues have not been issued yet. Please issue them immediately based on the local price index for this month, without any discounts, to maintain our livelihoods. Please also follow the usual practice and issue six months of funding for storage based on the current month's multiples so that we can overdraw and issue them at any time according to the current month's index, to avoid delays and further distress. If there are practical difficulties in allocating large amounts of gold yuan, please change to issuing silver dollars on a monthly basis according to the original salary as a fundamental improvement. According to the presidents of various colleges and universities, the ministry said in a telegram that the funding for March should still be handled according to the central government's regulations. Former Acting Minister Chen had promised the presidents that the salaries of teachers and staff would be issued according to 500, which our colleagues received after a 24% discount, which was already extremely small compared to the prices at the time. To go back on this small amount of money, how can we show great faith to the world? Now that the new cabinet has been established, we believe that it should reform the consistent sloppy style to comfort the hopes of the world. The lives of our colleagues are truly extremely difficult and unbearable. The situation is difficult, and we hope that we will not be forced to make further statements. Furthermore, the public funding for students is very meager, and the self-funded students have mostly lost their financial support due to the war, and their lives are equally painful. Please improve this situation quickly to avoid further problems. We urgently plead for your understanding. The Shanghai Area National College and University Professors Fellowship Association respectfully appeals."</p>

<p>The base pricing for barber shops in this city will be implemented soon. The social and political party bureaus believe that the determination of the base price is related to the daily life burden of citizens in the future and are handling it carefully.

In general, the prices before the war ranged from 1.7 yuan to 0.1 yuan, and the current prices range from 5,000 to 700 gold yuan (alley vendors). After obtaining the survey data, Mr. Xi will use it as a reasonable standard for determining the base price.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The City Bureau of Education originally planned to hold the City's Middle School Student Mandarin Speech Contest on the 29th of this month to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs and celebrate the Sixth Youth Day. However, due to the urgency of time and insufficient preparation, it was decided to hold the Municipal Middle School Student Mandarin Speech Contest on that day. The contest regulations are extracted as follows: (1) Time and location: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 29th of this month, held in the auditorium of the Municipal Yucai Middle School.

<p>After the reversal of the situation in North China, young students flocked to the south.

In addition, a group of Northeast refugee students is scheduled to take the Qiujin Wheel to Guangzhou this morning to request the Ministry of Education to find a way to borrow a school to study.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On January 26 of this year, a young girl named Sun Silan presented two insured drafts from the Bank of America, one for 550 U.S. dollars and one for 7,300 U.S. dollars, to the Chase Bank in this city for cashing. Experts identified them as counterfeit, so the police were notified to investigate. According to Sun's confession, she was instructed by a Polish man named Adomar Weiqu to use them. It was found that Adomar had no legitimate occupation and specialized in counterfeiting banknotes. The investigation of this case has been completed and transferred to the District Court for prosecution for the crime of counterfeiting valuable securities. However, Adomar has not been brought to justice, and Judge Ye Gui** of the District Court yesterday issued an arrest warrant for his detention.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the Chief of the Zhabei Police Sub-bureau, Sun Keqiang, was suspected of corruption and dereliction of duty, and Director Mao ordered his detention for investigation, the case was complicated.

<p>On March 12, at around 5 p.m., a Russian named An Te We Wan was buying and selling 20 U.S. dollars with a silver dollar vendor named Zhang Jinrong at the intersection of South Shaanxi Road and Central Linsen Road when he was discovered by police officers from the Changshu Road Police Sub-bureau. Both were detained and questioned. According to the Russian An Te's confession, he was not selling U.S. dollars, but because he needed money for living expenses, he intended to sell the 20 U.S. dollars he had. He did not know that selling U.S. dollars should be done with the Central Bank and that private buying and selling was a violation of the law. According to Zhang Jinrong's confession, he was indeed making silver dollar transactions due to the pressure of life. Because the Russian mistakenly thought that he was a U.S. dollar vendor, he was answering An Te's question about the price of U.S. dollars when he was arrested. The police bureau now believes that the transaction was not successful and the circumstances are light, so they are tentatively allowing a light punishment in accordance with Article 54, Item 11 of the Statute on Punishment of Violations of Public Security.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Meisheng, a resident of 61 Guangming Village, Hefei Road, had a friend named Ye Xibiao who had previously asked him for a loan unsuccessfully, resulting in a grudge. After returning home, he discussed a plan to deal with him with his brother, Xilong. On the afternoon of the 18th, at around 4 p.m., he went to rob with his brother. First, his brother Xilong stepped forward and knocked on the door. When he was in the kitchen, he asked Zhao's wife, Zhao Xiuying, "Is Brother Meisheng at home?" She replied that he had gone out. Xilong then grabbed an oil bottle and violently struck Zhao's wife on the head, causing her to faint on the spot. Xibiao followed and entered, helping his brother to remove a gold ring from Zhao's wife's hand. At this time, Zhao's wife regained consciousness slightly and shouted loudly. The police officer on duty outside heard the sound and arrived. Xibiao took the opportunity to escape, and only Xilong was captured and taken to the Songshan Road Police Sub-bureau for questioning. After verification, he will be transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.</p>

Shen then extorted 60 million legal tender from Zhu, saying that he could find a way to get the seized iron chains. Zhu first paid 30 million, but Shen failed to retrieve the iron chains for Zhu, so Zhu accused Shen of intending to defraud.

<p>The Police Bureau Ordered Its Subordinates to Report the Detailed List</p>
<p>The Criminal Division of the Police Bureau has recently decided to thoroughly crack down on the Broadsword Gang, which endangers public security. The head of the Criminal Division, Zheng Tingxian, has ordered his subordinates and the judicial sections of each sub-bureau to provide a detailed list of all the leaders and criminals of the Broadsword Gang in this city and submit it to the General Bureau within two weeks. He then ordered all relevant personnel to mobilize together, arrest them at the same time, and immediately execute the leaders of the Broadsword Gang who command the actions by firing squad. The gang members will be severely punished separately, depending on the severity of their circumstances. It is learned that the number of names on the Broadsword Gang blacklist is extremely alarming. It is said that there are more than a thousand important figures listed on the blacklist.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Chief of the City Police Bureau has ordered a strict crackdown on local thugs, vagrant soldiers, and Broadsword Gang members. In recent days, the various sub-bureaus have successively arrested more than ten Broadsword Gang members, who will be transferred to the Garrison Headquarters today to be severely punished in accordance with martial law.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Dismembered Male Corpse Found on Jinji Road Most Likely Came from the North. The Police Bureau is Investigating Clues from the Transportation Industry. <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the major case of the dismembered male corpse found on Jinji Road in West Shanghai, yesterday, Cheng Yikuan, the Chief of the Changshu Road Police Sub-bureau, personally led Chen Fenglin, the head of the Criminal Division, and various capable police officers to the scene and related places to conduct investigations throughout the day. It is heard that many extremely important clues have been obtained. According to general observation, although the murderer's disposal of the corpse in this case is even more cruel than the box corpse case at the North Station, according to the theory of criminology, criminal methods often have an imitative effect. It has now been determined that the time when the murderer committed the crime was not long before the time of the corpse dumping. Since the box corpse case occurred two weeks before, the murderer's motive for dismembering the corpse may have been influenced by this. Moreover, according to various signs at the scene, it is speculated that the principal offender or accomplice in this case is not someone without experience in medicine, anatomy, and slaughtering methods. Otherwise, cutting off bones and flesh with knives and axes could not be so neat and clean, and it is obvious that they can follow the rules of dissecting human or animal bone structures. Furthermore, the newspaper inside the corpse-containing package and the slip of paper inside the woman's jacket, which contained the corpse, are enough to prove that the murderer is an intellectual, or at least has received a considerable amount of education. The phrase "Those who have hatred with me, can be forgotten but not remembered" on the slip of paper, considering the tone, is between seemingly understandable and unintelligible, and may have been deliberately written. At the same time, all the words were printed in No. 6 lead type, rather than handwritten, which fully illustrates that the perpetrator had used wisdom, carefully considered the pros and cons, and meticulously planned the arrangement under the principle of leaving no traces. Based on the above conclusions, the main clues have generally appeared. In addition, Mr. Cheng Yikuan, who is currently in charge of the investigation, is a famous scholar who was previously sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States to study crime and investigation, and is now the leading expert in criminology in our country. He has solved major cases many times during his tenure as the captain of the criminal police brigade. All parties believe that he will be able to use skilled scientific methods to solve this "corpse-wrapping" case in a short period of time.</p>
<p>The Yellow Wrapped Luggage Bag is Definitely Not a Local Product</p>
<p>[Another Report] Regarding this cruel murder case, as of yesterday, although there was no obvious progress on the surface, according to the examination of the corpse, it has been determined that the deceased was from the North, in addition to the age and height. At the same time, after research, it was also determined that the yellow wrap and luggage bag containing the corpse were definitely not produced locally and most likely came from the North. Therefore, the murderer in this case may have deliberately created a smokescreen, dismembering the deceased in another city and transporting them to Shanghai. Another speculation is that the murderer first designed to lure the deceased to a remote area of this city, harmed them, and then dismembered them before moving the corpse to Jinji Road in the middle of the night. Therefore, in addition to requesting the Railway Bureau to mobilize railway police and employees to assist in tracking down passengers who carried similar yellow wrapped luggage bags on passenger cars in the past two days, the police bureau also asked the rickshaw, tricycle, and taxi associations in this city to investigate possible clues to solve the case.</p>
<p>The Changshu Police Sub-bureau Checks Household Registration in Its Jurisdiction</p>
<p>In addition, the Changshu Police Sub-bureau mobilized all police officers last night to conduct a thorough investigation of household registration in its jurisdiction. The bureau believes that the woman's jacket and the child's open-crotch pants are definitely related to the case. In short, the police bureau, in view of the increasing number of cases of destroying corpses and eliminating traces in this city, has also concentrated manpower and material resources to determine to expose the traitors and fugitives, and it is expected that the truth of this case will not be difficult to uncover in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Chief of the Songshan District Security Corps Falsely Reported the Number of Households and Embezzled Rice Ration Tickets and Fled After the Crime Was Discovered <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the investigation of rice rationing, the municipal food distribution office often sends personnel to work with investigators sent by the Economic Cooperation Sub-agency to conduct surprise inspections of rice stores in various districts. When they previously inspected the Dongtai Rice Store at 483 Jianguo East Road in the Songshan District, they found that Pang Bingyao, the chief of the 74th Security Corps in the district, had deposited 31 rice rationing tickets with key rationing certificates in the store, totaling three dan and one dou of rice. According to clues, they checked the sign-in register for the distribution of rice tickets in the corps and thoroughly investigated the households in the district. As a result, it was confirmed that Pang Bingyao, the chief of the corps, had indeed altered and falsely reported the number of households of Chen Mingxue, Yu Zhuang, Jin Yun, Ma Wangshi, and Chen A Da, embezzling 24 rice tickets. The office then transferred the case to the Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs for referral to the court for handling. Unexpectedly, Pang Bingyao fled in fear of the crime. The court is now investigating and summoning relevant personnel to pursue the matter. The office also welcomes citizens to report such situations. If the investigation is true, they will be punished according to law.</p>

<p>In some areas of North Shanghai in this city, there have recently been cases of refugees from various places arbitrarily building wooden sheds along the original house walls on the sidewalks of important roads and at key traffic intersections in various districts.

<p>[Our Own Correspondent] On the 20th of last month, Wang Longyun's wife, a passenger, boarded a train from Zhenjiang to Shanghai that day. When boarding in Zhenjiang, she first sent her two daughters (one five years old, the other two years old and still in swaddling clothes) and luggage onto the train. The passenger then hurried to the restroom. By the time she reached the platform, the train had already departed, with her two daughters aboard. The passenger then took the next train to Shanghai and searched everywhere without success. She went to the Railway Bureau's Police Department to report the incident and request assistance. It was later discovered that the two young girls had been taken to Danyang Station by the on-board railway police and handed over to Xu Baichun, a porter numbered fifteen at Danyang Station, and Wan Shunjun, a porter numbered forty-five, and their wives, to be cared for. Because the children were still being breastfed and were ill, doctors and wet nurses were hired to provide medical care and nursing. Many new clothes were also made for the children, incurring significant expenses over the course of twenty-odd days. By the 15th of this month, the children had recovered, and it had also been determined that they were Wang Longyun's lost children. The Jingxi Section Fifth Precinct of the Police Department dispatched railway police to escort Xu Baichun and others' wives, carrying the two young girls, to the Police Department. They were handed over to their original parent, who provided a guarantee to reclaim them. The Railway Bureau, recognizing that the wives of porters Xu Baichun and others, despite being rural women, were enthusiastic in caring for the lost children and demonstrated commendable public spirit and righteousness, and to promote the enthusiasm of employees and their families in serving the public, issued a bonus of 40,000 yuan to each person as an incentive.</p>

<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Tang Lizhen came to Shanghai in 1938 and worked as a helper at the Quit Smoking Hospital at 44 Tongchun Lane, Baike Road. In June 1946, Zhu Youyuan, the hospital accountant, seeing her youth and beauty, seduced her in every way and incited her to divorce her husband. Subsequently, Tang became pregnant and had to quit her job, relying on Zhu for a living. In 1947, she gave birth to a daughter. At the end of November last year, Zhu's eldest son, Zhu Jinian, found out about the affair and sent his father back to his hometown of Ningbo. Tang, with no means of support, sued Zhu for abandonment and also accused Zhu Jinian of hiding his father, demanding alimony and maintenance in the amount of 4,256 loads of white rice. Yesterday, the district court held a hearing. Zhu, being in his hometown, was unable to attend, and his eldest son appeared in court. Judge Ge Jianong of the district court ruled that, since the main defendant, Zhu Youyuan, had not appeared, the case would be rescheduled for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Forgery and Fraud; Shen Weijie, Teacher at Fisheries Administration School, Sentenced to One Year and Two Months; Zhao Heming Fined 10,000 Yuan <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Shen Weijie, a teacher at the school for children of employees of the Fisheries Materials Management Office, took advantage of the absence of the school principal, Shi Zhaohan, last August to steal the school seal he was responsible for and forge letters of appointment in preparation for deception. On December 12th of last year, using the alias "Yang Haoran," he impersonated an auditor from the Municipal Finance Bureau, printing many business cards and commissioning a seal with the inscription "Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance Audit Completed" from a print shop run by Wu Xingsheng. He also borrowed money from Xu Rongchang, who borrowed 6,000 yuan and 7,000 yuan each from Zhao Heming in the form of checks dated December 13th from Qiankang Bank, where Zhao had no funds, and gave them to Shen. After obtaining these checks, Shen went to a carving shop run by Cai Jinming and commissioned a seal of "Zhao Heming" and a seal of the "Audit Section of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance." He falsely claimed that Zhao was the chief of the Audit Section of the Bureau of Finance and then went to Wanli Typing Company, where he asked Jiang Yueli to type fourteen "Audit Notices from the Bureau of Finance," affixing the forged seals. He went to the Xinxin First Restaurant, posing as a financial auditor to audit the books, and took the opportunity to borrow cash from Yang Shenrui, using the 6,000 yuan check of Zhao Heming as collateral, and obtained 2,000 yuan in cash, asking Yang to cash the check. Subsequently, in the same way, he went to Xie Da Xiang Cloth Shop, used a 7,000 yuan check of Zhao Heming, and exchanged it for 3,500 yuan in cash with Cao Laoxi of the shop. He also used the pretext of auditing to defraud Tang Huaimin of four checks from the New China Bank and cashed one of them for 500 gold yuan. He used the remaining three checks to obtain 500 yuan in cash each from Mo Minyao and Chen Nanchang. He also defrauded Zeng Guanlin of a 1,000 yuan check from the China Reclamation Bank. He then opened an account in the name of Zhao Heming at Chunmao Money Exchange, obtained checks, and then used them arbitrarily, defrauding more than ten merchants such as Hu Wenchao of cash. Because the checks were all rejected, they inquired at the Finance Bureau and realized they had been defrauded. They reported to the police, who arrested Shen and handed him over to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Zhao Heming, Bai Zuqian, Xu Rongchang, Jiang Yueli, Wu Xingsheng, Cai Jinming, and Shen were jointly prosecuted for the crime of forging official documents. Judge Zhu Huaping of the district court held several hearings. Yesterday, all the victims were brought to court for questioning. The defendant, Shen Weijie, initially tried to deny the above-mentioned criminal facts, but after the victims testified separately, he bowed his head in silence. The other defendants, Zhao Heming, Bai Zuqian, Xu Rongchang, Wu Xingsheng, and Cai Jinming, all denied colluding with Shen. Jiang Yueli claimed that typing the forged audit notices from the Finance Bureau was a work assignment from the company, and she did not directly negotiate or receive compensation from Shen. At this point, the case was clear. The court then pronounced the sentence: Shen Weijie forged official documents, harming the public, and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. For the fraud part, he was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, to be served concurrently for a total of one year and two months. The other parts were found not guilty. Zhao Heming was fined 10,000 yuan for issuing bad checks. All other defendants were found not guilty.</p>

<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Since the 4th of this month, the Siberian high pressure originating in North China has repeatedly pushed eastward. Because it borders and meets the strong tropical air current in the southwest in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the atmosphere has remained humid and persistent, resulting in cold and overcast weather in this city almost every day, with continuous rain and wind. From the 4th to last night, the rainfall in this city has reached 91.3 millimeters, or 3.60 inches, which is a relatively high record for early spring rainfall in recent years. Yesterday morning, due to excessive condensation of the cold air mass, snow pellets fell with the heavy rain for half an hour before stopping. The average daily temperature was only 40 degrees Fahrenheit, with a low of 3.7 degrees Celsius (38.3 degrees Fahrenheit) and a high of only 5.7 degrees Celsius (42.3 degrees Fahrenheit), making it unusually cold. According to the Meteorological Observatory's forecast, this type of weather may persist until around the Lunar Qingming Festival before it gradually stabilizes and becomes milder.</p>

<h3 id="e128">A Picture of Family Exodus: Visiting Soldiers' Wives; The Future is Bleak, Sorrow Like the Sea <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Nanchang, 19th] "Fields and gardens deserted after war, families scattered on the roads." These two lines of Bai Juyi seem to be a true portrayal of the circumstances of soldiers' families stranded in the rear, because they depict the hardship they are in. Since the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, more than 10,000 soldiers' families who have been moved from the front lines of Jinan, Xuzhou, and Bengbu to Nanchang, according to statistics from the Nanchang Military Dependents Reception Station of the Logistics Command. According to the regulations of the reception station, all military dependents who pass through can register at the station, where they will be cared for and given three days of free rest at designated hotels in Nanchang before going west or choosing their own residence, so the military dependents from the battlefield seen at the reception station are all in such a hurry to come and go.</p>
<p>However, among this group of evacuated military dependents, there is a group of wives and children who have no home to go to or have temporarily lost contact with their husbands, or whose husbands have died in battle, and even old grandfathers with white hair and wrinkled faces...now wandering in the ancient city of Hongdu.</p>
<p>This group of military dependents, whose future is bleak, totals more than fifty people, from Shanxi, Shandong, Kaifeng, and Xu-Bengbu. Apart from two "wives of colonels," the rest are the wives of lower-level cadres. They support the old and carry the young, traveling all over the Jiangnan Plain to Hongdu. When they recall the life of family reunion, clothing, food, and warmth in Kaifeng, Jinan, and other places, they cannot help but sigh at the cruelty of war and the livelihood of "the future is bleak, sorrow like the sea."</p>
<p>Floors as Beds</p>
<p>Now, they live in the rooms on the third and fourth floors of the Jiangxi Hotel. Because they are stranded dependents, they cannot afford the expensive room rates. Naturally, all tea and operations cannot be enjoyed in the same way as distinguished guests. More than a dozen people are squeezed into a small room one zhang square, and the broken floor is their bed. The window without glass is just right for the sunshine to shine in, warming the broken hearts of the soldiers' families. The house is filled with dilapidated luggage and the cries of hungry children, forming a picture of refugees.</p>
<p>Husband at the Front</p>
<p>In this turbulent life, do they miss their homes? Do they miss their husbands at the front? From every haggard face, from their incessant comforting of their children, there is not only a bone-deep longing like looking through the autumn water, but they also see their husbands coming back in their dreams at night. The wife of a platoon leader who fought at the front in Kaifeng said: On the eve of the fall of Kaifeng, her husband sent her to the city. The next day, this ancient city of Bian Dye was occupied by the Communist army. She fled to Nanjing, and then met the government's evacuation and came to Nanchang. Regarding the news of her husband, after all kinds of inquiries, she recently heard from a brother in the platoon that her husband had sacrificed on the Kaifeng battlefield. Similarly, three other wives also received this kind of bad news. However, from despair, they are still praying, thinking, and longing for their husbands to have a one-in-a-million chance of survival and relive their good dreams. A company commander of Huang Botao's corps recently escaped from the battlefield to Nanjing. He got news from a friend that his wife had escaped to Nanchang. When he came to Hongdu and reunited with his family, his wife seemed to have had a dream. When this tragedy was rewritten into a comedy, many wives shed tears of joy.</p>
<p>Livelihood Becomes a Problem</p>
<p>The gentlemen at the reception station gave special preferential treatment to this group of military dependents. First, they made an exception to the rule of temporary residence for three days, and also solved their problems such as illness, medicine, and two meals of vegetables, firewood, and charcoal a day. However, in today's rice-pearl-salary hanging, it is not easy to support the lives of this group of suffering wives for a long time with the money raised from all sides! How to settle their lives in the future has become a problem that cannot be sustained for a long time and needs to be solved urgently.</p>
<p>Military Dependents in Nanchang</p>
<p>Here, we will record the names of the military dependents who were transferred from the Nanjing Station to Nanchang who have no home to go to or have lost contact with their husbands and are still stationed at the Jiangxi Hotel on Zhongshan Road in Nanchang, as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e129">Human Smuggling and Cargo Smuggling; Dantu and Zhenjiang Strictly Investigate <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 20th] Since the blockade of the Zhenjiang river surface, it has not been long before human smuggling and cargo smuggling have made Sanshan uneasy. In addition to strictly investigating and handling smugglers in recent days, a large number of cargo ships smuggling occurred on the Dantu river surface on the 17th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Two steamships, "Shi Tai" and "Li Qun," towed nine medium-sized wooden boats loaded with pigs, wine, cottonseed, and other large quantities of goods, smuggled from the north to the south of the Yangtze River. When passing through the Dantu river surface, they were discovered by the garrison troops, who immediately seized them in the river and telegraphed for verification. According to the investigation results, the two steamships and nine wooden boats were hired by the district chief of the port area, Liang Qimin, from Xie Xing and Shengcheng companies. Three wooden boats were loaded with pigs, two with wine, and four with cottonseed, escorted by the merchant Meng Jikun. They departed from Longwokou on the night of the 11th of this month. The destination was Zhenjiang. Li Ridong was the representative of the receiving party in Zhenjiang. There were more than seventy people on the eleven ships. In addition to the owners of the "Shi Tai" and "Li Qun" steamships, Li Changming and Yang Tangyun, and the owners and partners of the wooden boats, the identities of the remaining passengers were mostly unknown. Among them were Chen Zhimin and Gu Zhengrong, soldiers of the Ministry of National Defense, who were equipped with certificates. The identity cards of other merchants and civilians were mostly outdated.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of cargo transportation on the ship, this is a large-scale smuggling group with very meticulous planning. They spared no expense to establish close contacts with various checkpoints along the way from the Three Rivers Camp at the port to Sanjiangying, so they boldly moved forward. This batch was a tentative move. There were still more than forty large cargo ships moored in the Sanjiangying area, waiting to see how things went. If they could successfully reach Zhenjiang, they would continue to set off immediately.</p>
<p>The staff investigating this matter is unaware of whether there are contraband and weapons hidden in the cargo of the ship, and most of the passengers have unknown identities. They ordered the original ship to stop in the heart of the river and not allow it to land. They have reported the details to the Security Command and requested instructions. Yang Zongding, the deputy commander of the department, specially dispatched the City Defense Command and the Ship Control Station to Dantu on the morning of the 18th to conduct a strict inspection. They escorted the batch of ships to Zhenjiang late that night to await processing. It is heard that many important officials from relevant checkpoints are involved in this large-scale smuggling case, and the Provincial Security Department will severely punish this case.</p>
<p>There are still hundreds of fishing boats of various sizes moored along the Yangtze River in Zhenjiang. Since the authorities issued an order to block the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the livelihoods of many fishermen have been affected, and their livelihoods will be cut off. Several representatives were sent to the Zhenjiang Fishermen's Association a few days ago to appeal for relief. The association has submitted this kind of suffering to the county government and the garrisoned naval and army units, requesting them to consider the people's livelihood and stipulate the time and place for fishing, but it is still a question whether it can be approved.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The Controversy of "Opening Wuzhou" <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>[Report from Guangzhou, 19th of this month] On the third day after Acting President Li's Southern tour of Guangzhou, the forty-fifth cabinet meeting during Sun Ke's premiership passed an important resolution: to open Guangzhou and Wuzhou as treaty ports for foreign trade. This is a new record in the history of the Republic of China. After the government announced this measure, it immediately attracted great attention from the whole country, especially from people in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. However, due to their own interests, the people of Guangdong and Guangxi had two opposing views on this issue, resulting in intense controversy.</p>
<p>Viewpoints of the Opposition</p>
<p>In Guangdong, the strongest opposition came from the Guangdong-Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, the Rice Grain Association, and labor unions such as the shipping and maritime workers' unions. They believe that once Wuzhou is opened, foreign goods will be directly dumped into the southwestern provinces through Wuzhou, and raw materials will be purchased at low prices, which will severely damage the industry and commerce of the southwestern provinces. The economic lifeline of the people in the southwestern provinces will also be completely squeezed dry. The most important issue is the loss of national sovereignty. They pointed out that from the perspective of the overall national policy, treaty ports should be limited to coastal areas, while Wuzhou is the heart of South China. Once the port of Wuzhou is opened, it not only violates the basic national policy, but also allows imperialism to penetrate deeper into our heart through trade, escorting, protecting overseas Chinese, merchant ships, and warships, step by step! If convenience of foreign trade is the reason, then Lanzhou, Guizhou, Chongqing, and even any region can be opened for this reason. The National Assembly has a resolution: "No opening of navigation rights for any reason." Moreover, China's industry and commerce are backward, and the current import surplus has affected the entire national economy. The consequences after opening up are even more unimaginable! Therefore, they say that they are purely standing on the position of national sovereignty to firmly oppose and protest to the end. If the request to the Executive Yuan to revoke this resolution is unsuccessful, they are prepared to appeal to the Legislative Yuan to achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Insisting on Opening Wuzhou</p>
<p>Conversely, in Guangxi, they request the government to open Wuzhou as soon as possible. Here, the written statement issued by the 23rd Standing Committee of the Guangxi Provincial Council on the 15th of this month, as well as the telegram to the central government, can be taken as representatives of their general opinion. Their reasons are: Wuzhou is the main port of entry and exit for South China. A large amount of local products from Guangxi Province and parts of Guizhou and Zhejiang provinces are directly transported to Hong Kong and Macau for sale through this port, accounting for about 8% to 28% of the national export volume. A large number of daily necessities are imported from Hong Kong and Macau and then distributed to the interior. According to pre-war statistics, Wuzhou Customs revenue ranked ninth among the 40 customs offices nationwide in terms of foreign trade. At the same time, the Guangzhou-Wuzhou route is 418 kilometers, and the Hong Kong-Wuzhou route is 432 kilometers, with little difference between them. However, all goods are now transported through Guangzhou for export, which increases transportation costs, delays the time, and increases costs, making it impossible for goods to flow smoothly, causing domestic production to shrink, and the people's livelihood to be greatly affected, which also reduces foreign exchange inflows and tax revenue, and the national finances and finance suffer losses. As for the issue of opening inland navigation rights leading to the loss of national sovereignty, they refuted that the unequal treaties have long been abolished, and tariffs can be determined independently. It is not comparable to the opening of treaty ports under duress by the late Qing Dynasty. Moreover, Guangzhou, Hankou, Changsha, and other inland commercial ports have long been established with customs offices, all of which can engage in foreign trade. Restoring Wuzhou's customs taxation authority and opening up foreign trade rights is beneficial to merchants and promotes the prosperity of the inland economy and increased production, which is not contradictory.</p>
<p>The Problem is Expanding</p>
<p>From the above examples, they each hold their own views and have their own reasons. However, precisely because each has their own reasons, this problem is almost expanding day by day. But then again, it is only for the sake of their own interests. Because after Wuzhou is opened, the most important thing in Guangxi is to increase tax revenue and prosper the local economy. But in Guangdong, because Wuzhou is an inland river port on the Xijiang River, it is the gateway from Guangdong to Guangxi. In the past, foreign goods entering the Southwest had to pass through Guangzhou as a transshipment station. Therefore, the opening of Wuzhou will first hit the shipping merchants in Guangdong and Guangzhou, followed by the joint ventures in Guangzhou and the southwestern provinces that regularly conduct foreign trade, and then Guangzhou's future grain supply will also be affected. They believe that Guangxi grain can escape to Hong Kong along with ordinary commodities, which is why the Guangzhou Rice Grain Association also opposes it. The former Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan said it well. He once told reporters: "This issue is very simple. The people of Guangdong are for the benefit of Guangdong, and the people of Guangxi are for the benefit of Guangxi, but in fact, it is all for the benefit of the country." So he also said: "The Executive Yuan already has a very good solution." However, he did not reveal this solution.</p>
<p>View of the Supervisory Committee Office</p>
<p>At the same time, the Joint Office of the Supervisory Committee in Guangdong and Guangxi also attaches great importance to this issue. What are the pros and cons? Will the opening of navigation rights affect our future sovereignty? What was the actual situation when this case was passed in the Executive Yuan? They have now sent people to investigate. According to Supervisory Committee member Zhang Jun, who went to Guangxi for inspection and returned to Guangzhou, Guangxi is unusually poor. The lives of military and government officials in the places he passed through were very difficult. However, to maintain local security, the local militia cannot be reduced, so the burden is heavy. Is the opening of the port of Wuzhou intended to increase tax revenue to make up for this? Therefore, it must now be submitted for investigation, and it can only be handled after the results are obtained.</p>
<p>However, although this issue is still developing in the active activities of both parties, anyway, they are all our own people, and I believe it will not lead to any serious consequences.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Distress of Guizhou Province <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Report from Guiyang, 16th of this month] "Three parts of spring color and two parts of sorrow, another round of wind and rain," this is a depiction of the early spring weather, a symbol of the current domestic situation, and even more so the mood of the Guizhou provincial authorities. Whenever Guizhou's political program is lost and it has no way to turn, it feels particularly distressed and at a loss compared to any neighboring province because of various restrictions imposed by geographical conditions and historical factors.</p>
<p>Speaking of the current political situation in Guizhou, in terms of route and style,</p>
<p>Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei Provinces have long been prepared for changes since last winter. Because of the superior geographical, transportation, and economic conditions, they have always been favored by the central government. Their political distress is indeed much less than that of Guizhou. Sichuan and Yunnan provinces have always been known as "special circumstances." Precisely because of "special circumstances," whether in power or in opposition, they rarely make estimates when doing things. In other words, these two provinces seem complex but are actually simple. Only Guizhou is different. Its geographical location is between "major powers." It is difficult to serve both Qi and Chu. It strives to defend and support itself by being friendly and kind to its neighbors. It is already difficult enough to serve the great with the small. Moreover, the domestic situation has been depressed for a long time, and the situation between Hankou, Nanjing, and Guangzhou is even more difficult to see clearly. A veteran and important minister who has a long historical relationship with Xikou and is also an isolated and unfilial son is forced to clarify his position in this remote corner without soldiers, horses, or money. The extent of his distress can be imagined.</p>
<p>Guizhou is the Guizhou of the central government, and the central government is the central government of the Chinese people. With historical understanding and a spirit of great righteousness and integrity, taking out conscience to work for the central government of the Chinese people and for the central government's Guizhou, it is a steady way to hold the post, do more and talk less, and try to get through this difficult time. But in terms of the political situation in the province, it is also the development of the situation affecting people's hearts. The southwest of Guizhou is affected by banditry in the border areas of Yunnan and Guangxi, and the northeast of Guizhou is affected by banditry in the border areas of Sichuan and Hunan. In addition, years of war of resistance and suppression of the rebellion have left the people's livelihood devastated. The accumulated disasters have become larger and larger, and the cunning and resentful are clearly distinguished. The social security order in various places has always been difficult to restore. Military solutions make the people unafraid of death, not to mention that the local armed forces are not sound at all. Political solutions indulge evil and are enough to encourage wrongdoing. Using both methods at the same time does not seem to have any sustained effect. Do you not see the result of Ma Henglin, a provincial senator from Xiuwen, raising troops to rebel? In the end, he can only rely on military solutions. Speaking of Guizhou's</p>
<p>Finance and Economy Because it is barren and the people are poor, it is at a loss without the central government. Ninety-five percent of the provincial finances rely on central government funding. When public school teachers were paid twelve times their monthly salary, the entire province had to rely on the central government to allocate 5 billion yuan per year to cover expenses. Since March, it has been changed to paying salaries based on the cost of living index, and the amount of money required can be imagined. The shared tax between the central and local governments does not seem to be enough to cover the expenses of the tax collectors, and although efforts have been made to rectify and prevent tax evasion and corruption, slogans remain slogans, and those who engage in fraud and embezzlement are still everywhere. In particular, the central government recently decided that after the end of the 37th fiscal year for grain, grain requisitioning will no longer be carried out. The source of military and public grain in the future is indeed causing those in charge of finance to sigh at the roof. The provincial government recently reduced the amount of public grain received by each public school teacher per month from four shi dou to two shi dou, wanting to supplement public grain for military grain necessary for local armed forces in the future. This is what makes public school teachers complain the most about their future lives, but there is nothing they can do. In the past, in the era of warlords in Guizhou, the provincial finances relied on selling opium to make up for payments. Some time ago, someone suggested to the authorities that they might as well divide the province into districts to ban opium, some seriously and some slowly, and simply let the people grow opium. This would not only solve the problem of rural security in turmoil, but also make up for the provincial fiscal deficit. However, Chairman Gu has always been deeply disgusted with opium and resolutely opposed it, so the matter was dropped.</p>
<p>The most serious financial problem currently facing Guizhou is that the Guiyang branch of the Central Bank is unable to transport gold yuan notes to the province because the head office cannot print them in time. At the same time, Guizhou's transportation is inconvenient,</p>
<p>Cash Transportation is often plagued by the inability to provide relief. The Treasury Department often delays sending payment orders to the central and provincial government agencies in Guizhou for half a month or a month. Even if they are sent, the Central Bank has no cash to allocate. Such delays and disconnections are tantamount to the prelude to the disintegration of the entire financial system. No wonder the Guizhou Higher People's Court, the National Guizhou University, the Guizhou Normal University, the three medical colleges, and the provincial government often quarrel with the Central Bank in Guiyang over the allocation of funds, arguing until their faces turn red. When public school teachers finally manage to receive ten or twenty times their salary, prices have already jumped to fifty or a hundred times the previous level. Due to the extreme shortage of cash, the Central Bank is struggling to cope, so it issues large-denomination promissory notes of 10,000 and 50,000 yuan, creating a phenomenon where discounts on market transactions are as high as 70% to 80%. As a result, credit tightens, interest rates increase, prices skyrocket, and the people's lives become even more miserable. Everyone is saying that the gold yuan is following the old path of the legal tender, and the gold yuan is not as valuable as the legal tender. This pain is currently not unique to Guizhou province, but Guizhou, which relies on the central government to allocate gold yuan notes to assist it, of course, feels the pain even more.</p>
<p>If it were a province with abundant production and abundant resources, there would be no such distress. Places that have "nothing" always have to ask places that have "something." But Guizhou is not like that. Cotton cloth must rely on Hunan, hardware, electrical, and general merchandise must rely on Guangdong, and the food that the people cannot live without for a day relies purely on Sichuan. Guizhou people have to use money for everything</p>
<p>to buy from other provinces, but Guizhou people have no money. Chairman Gu Zhenglun has returned to Guizhou to take charge for almost a year. He has a deep understanding of the crux of the problem and advocates increasing production across the board to exchange Guizhou's tobacco, vegetables, tung oil, and other items for cotton yarn and salt from other provinces. Over the past year, this problem has remained the same and has not improved much. Take salt as an example: Sichuan salt is transported to Guizhou, the road is long and difficult, the capital tied up is too high, and there is collusion between officials and merchants for corruption. Therefore, it is advocated to designate Guizhou Province as a special sales area for salt, break the salt sales system, and allow the free and unhindered sale of Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Huai salt into Guizhou. Under this decision, the Guizhou Provincial Publicly Operated Products Transportation and Sales Company took the lead in obtaining a salt loan and has purchased and transported two batches of Guangdong salt from the Guangdong and Guangxi Salt Affairs Bureau to Guizhou, which the company directly distributes to the people of Guiyang for consumption. However, transporting salt from Guangzhou to Guiyang is not closer than transporting it from Sichuan. Purchasing and transporting Guangdong salt in Guangzhou, all prices are based on the Hong Kong dollar at the time. Purchasing and transporting it in Sichuan is based on the official fixed warehouse price in gold yuan. Guangdong salt to Guizhou is not "tofu transformed into meat price," but it is not as good as people's ideals.</p>
<p>Guangdong needs Guizhou's vegetables and tung oil the most. Last year, the Guizhou Provincial Products Transportation and Sales Company signed a contract with Song Ziwen's Guangdong Materials Adjustment Committee to</p>
<p>exchange materials at equal prices. The Guizhou Products Company has shipped more than 100 tons of vegetable oil to Guangzhou and plans to continue to ship tung oil, gallnuts, and American tobacco to exchange for some "foreign exchange." Unfortunately, it was not the right time. Song Ziwen fell, and the heart of the Materials Adjustment Committee stopped beating, so that the Guizhou Products Company still has three or four hundred large barrels of vegetable oil that cannot be transported. This is to say that Guizhou is also feeling deeply distressed in terms of material adjustment. Fortunately, Guizhou's</p>
<p>Local Armed Forces have gradually been strengthened. According to the person in charge, he is very confident that it will not be difficult to quell the clowns in various places in a short period of time. Even if the Communist army invades, an invading force of 30,000 to 50,000 people will not be difficult to drive out of the province. Guizhou currently has purely local armed forces, including seven provincial security regiments, seven independent battalions in the special commissioner districts, and 79 county militia standing companies. The two military districts in eastern and western Guizhou will each establish two to six supplementary regiments, and each can establish a modernized supplementary regiment. Recently, the Sixth Training Command newly organized the 98th Army, one army and two divisions, in Guizhou, stationed in northern and western Guizhou. Everything is borne by the Ministry of National Defense, but it can be used purely to ensure local security. Director Zhang Qun of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters approved the advance replenishment of the weapons and ammunition of the local armed forces in Guizhou in order to comprehensively strengthen and complete the equipment of the local armed forces at the provincial and county levels. This is really enough to make the distressed Guizhou feel a smile.</p>
<p>Gu Zhenglun has always been unsmiling, and it seems even more so in recent months. We still feel that Guizhou is facing distress. He must feel the same way, so he encourages his subordinates to bury themselves in hard work, do more and talk less. He also put forward his "Outline of the Implementation Plan for the Central Work of the 38th Year" at the provincial government meeting yesterday (11th), taking "self-awareness, self-defense, self-government, and self-sufficiency" as its basic principles, being calm, and moving forward bravely. Guizhou's distress may be relieved in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e132">A Drop of Nectar of New Music Folk Song and Dance in Paradise <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>"Military-Civilian Cooperation Song" was also adopted by the American military. Now, Shu Mo's compilation is widely sung in the American army. Their lives are quite difficult, traveling around busily with very little pay. After the end of the War of Resistance, they continued to work in cultural positions, from Hankou to Nanjing, and from Nanjing to Hangzhou. This is a strong army on the cultural front.</p>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou, 20th of this month] When the infinite spring light comes to the West Lake, there is a very meaningful literary and artistic activity here, which is the "Spring Song and Dance Performance" of the Fourth Performing Troupe.</p>
<p>"Fourth Performing Troupe"</p>
<p>Speaking of the "Fourth Performing Troupe," this is a familiar name. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they stood on the front line of the cultural war, fighting culturally against the enemy, Japan. They worked in the Fourth War Zone and spent a long time in Guilin, the "Cultural City" during the war. The leader, Wei Manqing, is a determined cultural worker. There is also a composer, Shu Mo, whose songs such as "You Naughty Thing" and "Military-Civilian Cooperation Song" have been sung by the vast majority of people. Moreover, it is worthy of our admiration and praise.</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, there have been many song and dance performances and many drama performances in the past, but this performance of theirs has shocked the entire Hangzhou. First of all, the Hangzhou newspapers have praised the success of their work with dedicated columns. At the same time, large groups of audience members have flocked to the place where they are performing. Again, many schools and organizations have requested them to perform once as a demonstration for future work. Why have they achieved such success? That is because their songs and dances express the voices of the people.</p>
<p>Simple and Beautiful Language</p>
<p>When Duanmu Hongliang and I discussed the definition of music with reporters, we felt that music is the purest Esperanto and the most beautiful and gorgeous language shared by mankind. How to make music an Esperanto? How to make music shared by mankind? That can only be done by approaching the people, living with the people, and extracting their true, good, and beautiful emotions, and then elaborating and creating. China is the earliest nation to recognize the value of music education. Unfortunately, it was later occupied by a few people, and the remaining folk songs that are about to be submerged. Now we should contact it, get close to it, and promote the true voice of the people. I remember that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, I met with the musician Sheng Jialun in the rear and we talked about the importance of people's music. He said, "Our opinions are very close! I am preparing to go deep into various remote areas to collect folk songs." Several times, we met with the musician Ma Sicong and also talked about this. He humbly asked me which of the music he played was the best? I told him that what I loved the most was "Tibetan Tone Poem" and "Suiyuan Suite." We discussed what the latest music is? The conclusion we reached is that the latest music should be in a form and content that is loved by the vast majority of people, should be understood by the vast majority of people, and the singers should be quite mellow. Yes, our previous music was spread among the people, making people feel free and happy in the life of music. Later, music was used as decoration and embellishment, and people's musical life was gradually abandoned. Now we must re-popularize music among the people so that the majority of people can enjoy it.</p>
<p>Exploration and Efforts</p>
<p>This performance of the Fourth Performing Troupe is in line with what we discussed. They perform the lives of the people in a new form. In the overall program, the chorus includes "Sun Yat-sen Memorial Song", "Reclaiming Spring Soil", "Farmer's Suffering", "Dawn is Coming", and "Rice Planting Ballad". The unison singing includes "Spring Comes to the World", "Welcoming Spring Ballad", "Melting Ice Song", and "Bad Wife", the male solo includes "Reclaiming Song", "Sending Big Brother", the male duet includes "Listen to Me", "Two In-Laws", the female solo includes "Miserable Daughter-in-Law", the male and female duet includes "Couple Duet", the folk dance includes "Driving a Cart to Find Her Husband" and "Aunt Wang Mending a Jar", and the dance includes "Jiarong Wine Party" and "Miao Dance". It can be said that the East of the people is completely moved to the stage. In these many songs and dances, the sorrows and hardships of the people are fully explained, but they have a rich vitality and a sincere and frank feeling. They are exploring and striving.</p>
<p>Walking a Path</p>
<p>What is especially valuable is that "Driving a Cart to Find Her Husband", accompaniment, dance, and singing have all reached a new realm of perfect art. Of course, they are not "musicians" who have drunk foreign water and specialize in singing Western songs, nor are they "musicians" who specialize in playing Western music with Western instruments. Their cultivation is not as good as "musicians", but their performances are so sincere. They are praised by an audience. They are a drop of nectar for irrigating new music in the future.</p>
<p>The overall situation is at a critical juncture where war and peace are undecided, and the people are in deep trouble. Coordinating with the arrival of spring, folk songs and dances are being performed in this paradise that already smells of gunpowder, which is of great significance. We hope that future art can follow this direction and work together.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Recent Developments in Sichuan Politics After the "Rumor Wind" <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[Chengdu Dispatch, April 14] After half a month of political turmoil and rumors in Sichuan, the situation seemingly cleared up with Zhang Qun taking office and calling for unity among the Sichuan-Kang generals. In the past few days, Zhang Qun went to Nanjing to attend the National Affairs Conference, taking with him a comprehensive plan for stabilizing the Southwest. Wang Lingji, Liu Wenhui, and Deng Xihou returned to Chengdu together to carry out their respective tasks. The political atmosphere in Chengdu seemed to shift from dazzling to calm. However, the provincial government suddenly adopted a series of extraordinary measures, drawing special attention from society. General observation suggests that the Sichuan political situation has now developed to its highest point in the process of transformation.</p>
<p>Self-Defense and Peace Negotiations: Various Deployments</p>
<p>The primary focus of Sichuan's current political affairs is the "self-defense and peace negotiations" sought by all levels of society, i.e., striving for comprehensive peace by strengthening its own capabilities. Recently, the situation in southern Shaanxi and northern Hubei has become tense, and new deployments have been made for Sichuan's defense. Sun Zhen, the Pacification Director of the Sichuan-Hubei Border Area, originally stationed in Yichang, has retreated to Liangshan and been reassigned as the Commander of the Central Sichuan Pacification Zone, commanding the armies of Sun Yuanliang and Luo Guangwen to guard eastern Sichuan. The 95th Army led by Huang Yin, originally under the command of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Area Pacification Headquarters, is stationed in Guangyuan, coordinating with the Hu Zongnan troops moving south from Hanzhong to defend northern Sichuan. For internal defense, the Sichuan province plans to organize seven Sichuan Defense Armies and expand twenty Security Regiments, coordinating with the seven National Defense Armies recently established in Sichuan by the central government, to serve as the basic force for self-defense and security in Sichuan. The provincial government is implementing a province-wide public self-defense training program, which has been fully launched in 144 cities and counties. The program involves a total of 4,336 brigades, 546,575 squads, and 1,762,935 people. Including self-defense cadres, the total number of people participating exceeds four million, and all the armed preparations will be completed within the next month. In addition, Sichuan has completed joint defense plans with neighboring provinces, including Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, and Guizhou, establishing 23 joint defense organizations and 98 joint defense counties. Through months of deployments inside and outside the province, a copper wall and iron barrier has been built.</p>
<p>Personnel Changes: New Measures Adopted</p>
<p>In coordination with the self-defense and military expansion, the provincial government has recently taken two extraordinary measures. The first is a major reshuffle of personnel throughout Sichuan. In the first round on the 5th, 30 county magistrates, 63 tax bureau chiefs, and 9 land and food bureau chiefs were transferred. In the second round on the 9th, important personnel in 22 counties were changed. More than one hundred counties were affected in the half-month of political ups and downs. The inside story is left to speculation. The second is a major review of security regiments throughout Sichuan, personally presided over by Wang Lingji. In addition to the 3rd Security Regiment stationed in Songpan and Lixian being moved to Chengdu for inspection, Wang Lingji personally toured northern Sichuan with the deputy commander of the security forces, and then went to southern and central Sichuan to inspect various security regiments and supervise the training of local militias. Contrasting this with the telegram from the six security regiment commanders attacking the provincial government amidst the rumor wind of the Sichuan situation last month, it is generally believed that the significance of this inspection is not ordinary. These two measures happened right after the Sichuan political rumor storm. Wang Lingji stated that they were purely to strengthen the promotion of government affairs, but from the sidelines, it seems to contain a political and military rectification effect. At the same time, Wang Lingji openly criticized the widespread pamphlets and documents attacking him at the provincial government's monthly meeting on the 8th, pointing out that a few unscrupulous elements were deliberately creating trouble, and that he would thoroughly investigate and arrest them in his capacity as the commander of martial law. This shows that there are still undercurrents brewing in the Sichuan situation, and Wang Lingji is rectifying and preventing changes in the provincial government.</p>
<p>The Mainstream of Public Opinion Demands Stability</p>
<p>After ten years of separation and chaos, what the people of Sichuan unanimously seek is: peace, not war; change, not chaos. At the provincial government's monthly meeting, Wang Lingji reported that the central task of Sichuan province this year is first to seek security through self-defense, and second to seek progress in stability. Xiang Chuanyi, representing the provincial council, attended the Southwest Military and Political Conference, emphasizing four requirements: (1) seeking peace, (2) reforming politics, (3) reorganizing the economy, and (4) self-defense and self-rescue. However, the prerequisite for self-defense and stability is to seek unity first. Recently, the Sichuan political situation has been turbulent, and rumors have been spreading, partly due to uncoordinated actions. For example, the Kang troops were mobilized last month, the provincial government took measures this week, a small unit of Hu Zongnan's troops from southern Shaanxi was recently transferred to Yanting, Santai, and Zhongjiang for reorganization, and the newly formed national army freely recruited soldiers in various places, causing discord in the personnel of the Sichuan National Defense Army, etc. The inside story has caused outsiders to speculate endlessly, giving rumor-mongers an excuse. Currently, all parties are making various efforts to eliminate the invisible. For example, the provincial council telegraphed the central government to stop conscription, strictly prohibit free recruitment, and politely requested Hu's troops to postpone their reorganization in Sichuan, with the intention of reducing the complexity of the Sichuan political situation, first seeking internal stability and clarification, and then seeking unity and self-defense, in order to achieve the ultimate goal of joint defense and mutual assistance in the Southwest and jointly strive for comprehensive peace. This is the three-part harmony that all parties are conspiring to stabilize Sichuan, and it is also the correct measure that the people of Sichuan wholeheartedly support. With the impact of this mainstream of public opinion, all undercurrents will be submerged and eliminated without a doubt. The clarification of the Sichuan situation will be seen in a short period of time.</p>

<p>Anyone with a missing daughter in 1937 should pay special attention.</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Shenbao Social Services Column:</p>
<p>You are probably surprised to receive this letter, right? This is because I am forced to come up with this idea out of desperation. I hope that you gentlemen will help me with the spirit of helping the poor and weak!</p>
<p>I am originally from Shanghai. In 1937, I was abducted by an evil person and sold to a brothel in Qingdao. It has been twelve years of suffering amidst their beatings and scoldings. In these twelve years, I have been thinking of my dear parents, brothers, and sisters every day. Unfortunately, under strict surveillance, I, a helpless, lonely, and weak woman, cannot fly out of this living hell even with wings. After much deliberation, I finally found a ray of light. I implore your newspaper to lend me a helping hand and help me find my parents, brothers, and sisters so that I can escape from the sea of suffering as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The following are my family situation and the details of my abduction:</p>
<p>I remember that my surname is Chen (I have forgotten my given name), and I am now nineteen years old. I was seven years old when I was abducted. My parents are still alive, and I have an older brother and two older sisters (my eldest sister was already married at that time). My father is a businessman. At that time, my brother and second sister were still in school. I remember that I also had a younger brother who was blind due to illness and died soon after. My home is located on a corner of Zhongzheng Middle Road, above a clock shop. One day, there was a wedding next door, and I secretly ran over to watch the excitement. A middle-aged man said to me: "How about I take you to your aunt's house to play?" I really had an aunt who was still running a lumber mill at that time, so I went with him. Little did I know that I had fallen into the trap of that evil person. I was taken to the countryside by him. A day later, he took me, a young woman, an old woman, and a girl who was a little older than me and had been abducted from somewhere, on a boat to Qingdao. He sold me to a brothel, and I lost contact with him! At this time and place, what could a lonely girl like me do? Please, gentlemen, show mercy and publish this. Perhaps my parents, brothers, and sisters are still living in Shanghai and will see this newspaper and save me from the sea of suffering!</p>

<p>[Yixing Dispatch, April 19] Ma Haorong, a resident of Fucun Village, Heqiao Town, this county, owns more than a thousand acres of good farmland and lives a prosperous life. On the 11th of this month, four bandits, secretly armed with long and short guns, sneaked into Fucun Village and forced Ma Wencheng, the chief of the tenth Bao, to accompany them to Ma Haorong's house and kidnap him. When they left the gate, they covered his head with a long gown and carried him into a boat. The family soon received a letter from the kidnappers demanding a loan of 300 shi of military supplies to be delivered on the lake. The family reported this to Chief Liu of Zhongxi Township, who immediately ordered Zhou Hua, the leader of the standby squad, and a large number of officers to search along the Wudong Bridge and the banks of Gehu, on the border of Wuyi, for three days and nights. They arrested the two kidnappers, Wang Zhengpei and Jiang Wenqin, along with two hand grenades, in a suspicious boat, and rescued the hostage Ma Haorong.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Since the Yangtze River Blockade, Zhenjiang's Shunjiangzhou is in a State of Suffocation <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>[Zhenjiang Dispatch, April 18] Shunjiangzhou, also known as Lotus Pond, in Zhenjiang, is located approximately fifteen kilometers downstream of Jiaodong, Zhenjiang. It is a small island in the Yangtze River, surrounded by water. On the island is only the small town of Gaoqiao. The island faces the Yangtze River to the south, opposite Dagang, and connects to the three districts of Jiangdu to the north. After the victory, it was renamed Gaoqiao District. The population is approximately 30,000, most of whom make a living by doing business, while those living in the countryside make a living by fishing for shrimp and crabs. The agricultural products of the entire district are only enough to sustain the people for three days. The only external transportation routes are the Zhenkou and Yaozhen lines. Recently, the river surface has been blocked, ships have been suspended, and transportation to Dagang has been cut off, leaving the entire island in a state of suffocation. Recently, a unit of the national army arrived, requiring each Bao to supply eight Dou of white rice, eight Jin of soybean oil, and three Jin of kerosene every day. The prices of rice, oil, salt, and other daily necessities have soared several times. People may starve to death. Now the citizens are appealing to the authorities to quickly open Dagang and restore transportation with Lotus Pond so that materials can circulate slightly and the burden on the people can be reduced slightly.</p>

<p>[Zhenjiang Dispatch, April 15] Another robbery case by vagrant thieves occurred here. On the evening of the 13th, four people in uniform went to the home of Zhang Xianfu, a merchant from Wuyang at No. 53 Xiaomenghu, and robbed two rings (weighing a total of five Qian, five Fen, and one Li), etc. Mr. and Mrs. Zhang resisted the search by the thieves, resulting in Mr. Zhang being shot in the head. The four criminals then fled. Mr. Zhang immediately reported the incident to the police station, which notified all the silver shops in the city to report to the bureau if they found rings of the same weight being exchanged. The next afternoon, two people in military uniforms went to Xintianbao Silver Shop, holding two rings of the same weight, to exchange them. The shop clerk pretended to be accommodating while secretly reporting to the nearby police station. Police officers were dispatched, and the two were arrested on the spot and sent to the criminal investigation team for interrogation. The two criminals, Yuan Changgui and Zhou Peng, both confessed to robbing Zhang Xianfu's home. However, they only stated that they were working with three people, and the other criminal, Ge Xingrong, has now fled to Wuxi. The stolen goods were recovered by the criminal investigation team and returned to Zhang Xianfu on the 14th.</p>

<h3 id="e143">First Day of Market Trading Resumption: Gold Prices Plummet <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The total amount of transactions for the day was not large, and the process was idle</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Gold Trade Association of this city officially resumed collective trading at 10:00 AM yesterday. However, no ceremony was held. Industry leaders Xu Fusun and Zhao Zhongying, the acting chairman of the association, personally presided over the event. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Gold Control Bureau, the Central Bank, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce attended to provide guidance. Liu Gongyun, Lin Chongyong, Li Daonan, Li Jiacai, Pan Hengqin, and others sent flower baskets to express their congratulations.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the association considered that it was the beginning of the resumption of the market. As of the opening of the market yesterday, only 39 telephone lines had been installed. However, 18 more were installed successively yesterday, so the market transaction throughout the day was quite idle. The bid prices fluctuated very little. It took a long time for each member to strike out and strike in one or two transactions. In total, about one hundred transactions (i.e., one thousand taels) were concluded in the morning, and only ten or so in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market trend officially opened the market with the association. It was also heard that the National Bank had a sell-off near noon. The market trend changed from the flat trend in the morning to a full-scale decline in the afternoon. Compared with the opening price of 5,570,000 per tael in the morning and the closing price of 5,165,000 per tael in the afternoon, the price per major transaction fell by as much as 400,500 yuan in one day, which can also be said that the financial authorities have begun to exert their control over the official open market.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the gold market opened at 557, and then it was all in a flat market. It closed at 546 at 12:00. In the afternoon, it opened low at 517, with the lowest price seen at 516 in small transactions. Finally, it closed at 5165, and the process was lightly described.</p>
<p>In addition, yesterday, various firms inside and outside the industry believed that the fineness of the gold circulating in the market is mostly around 985. According to the association's trading rules, it has been rigidly stipulated that it must be above 985, otherwise it must be compensated according to the fineness and an additional 2 Qian for medicinal work. Many expressed dissatisfaction, so there were discussions about stopping trading together. However, according to the association, the association's drafting of the trading rules is based on the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, and it is not convenient to modify them accordingly. The current market may be inconvenient due to the sudden change of habits. However, following it for a long time will naturally correct the habit of insufficient fineness.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Liu Gongyun, after the Gold Industry Association resumed trading, the National Bank stopped allocating gold and sold it in the market instead. Currently, the market is only limited to the buying and selling of gold. The method of selling silver dollars is still to be studied in the next step.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Trading Rules of the Gold Industry Association <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The trading rules drafted by the association are as follows: (Dated March 21, 1949)</p>
<p>(1) The unit of buying and selling price is 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) A commission of 1.5% is charged to customers for both buying and selling.</p>
<p>(3) If the gold is insufficient when receiving and delivering, the limit is 2 Qian. If it is raised, the limit is also 2 Qian. The fractional balance is settled according to the closing price.</p>
<p>(4) If the fineness of the gold is below 985, in addition to compensating according to the fineness, an additional 2 Qian for medicinal work is required.</p>
<p>(5) The seller must deliver the goods and collect the payment by himself. However, for members outside the telephone area codes 1 and 9, the buyer or seller must collect and deliver the goods by himself.</p>
<p>(6) Payment is limited to cash and cashier's checks. If there is not enough time, an application form can be used, but the time must not exceed 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>(7) If there are clearing matters between members, they shall be handled by the members themselves.</p>
<p>(8) Matters not covered by these rules shall be amended by the Management Committee at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Money Market Tightens First and Then Loosens <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's money market was firm in the morning, and loosened again in the afternoon due to the authorities making a large difference and reporting a full-scale loosening. The daily interest rate opened at 80-90 yuan, but after 10:00 AM, all commodities reported declines. Those with long positions rushed to sell, and the daily interest rate fell to 70-80 yuan. In the afternoon, the national bank made a large difference, and the exchange position turned loose. The daily interest rate fell back to 60-70 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the national banks made a total difference of more than 3.87 billion yuan, the foreign banks made a difference of more than 720 million yuan, the large exchange banks made a difference of more than 1.95 billion yuan, and the small exchange banks made a difference of more than 2.64 billion yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Difficulties in Clearing Checks <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A few days ago (on the 21st), the check clearing house had difficulties in clearing because some banks and firms had difficulty in turning over their positions. The clearing was not completed until 8:00 PM, and it was not made up until yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The situation improved yesterday, but the exchange was not completed until after 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>The reasons are: (1) The money market suddenly tightened in the evening a few days ago, and the number of returned checks increased. (2) There is a shortage of cash. It is now heard that the Gold Control Bureau has paid attention to this matter and decided to thoroughly investigate the reasons for the delayed exchange and properly plan preventive measures for the future.</p>

<p>It was recently learned from the Financial Control Bureau that the stipulated period for the portion of the increased capital in cash transferred by banks and firms to the National Bank is three months. It will expire at the end of March of this year, and it can be retrieved. The bureau will notify each bank and firm to collect it upon maturity together with the Business Bureau of the National Bank. In addition, the bureau held the 21st audit meeting with the Audit Office of the Business Bureau of the National Bank yesterday and approved more than 30 applications for transferring and using cash for increased capital.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to the Central Bank to Level the Inland Exchange Rate <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Reduce the cost of purchasing goods in the interior</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Business Bureau of the Central Bank yesterday, requesting to level the inland exchange rate to facilitate the purchase of goods. The letter stated: "We are now informing the exporters that when Shanghai exporters purchase goods from the producing areas, the funds remitted should be at a premium due to the discount interest burden in order to achieve equilibrium. However, recently, the value of domestic currency has depreciated repeatedly. For example, for every 1,000 yuan of gold yuan notes sent from Shanghai to Wanxian, Sichuan, only 400 yuan can be received in Wanxian. If you take cash, there are only 300 yuan. The extent of the depreciation is appalling.</p>
<p>As for the price of goods in the producing areas, the rising trend exceeds that of Shanghai due to the increase in the cost of living. Under the double pressure of exporters, how can they proceed with procurement? Please order the banks to quickly handle the issue of leveling the exchange rate, etc. We have learned that the domestic remittance is usually regulated by your bank, and the exchange rate charged by commercial banks for remittance must not exceed a certain limit stipulated by your bank.</p>
<p>In view of the aforementioned situation, we request that you adjust the places with unusually high exchange rates, appropriately allocate funds to achieve the effect of leveling the exchange rate, so that Shanghai merchants can slightly reduce the cost of purchasing goods in the interior, and the national economy and people's livelihood will benefit. We hope that you will supervise and implement this and reply accordingly."</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Money Market is Tight and People are Afraid: Chinese Stocks Fall into a Plague Situation <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Chinese stock market situation was sluggish from the beginning yesterday, and then entered a plague-like state. The stock market sentiment was extremely bleak. Since the popularity of the high-interest-rate market, the rise in the stock market has been much worse than the general price level, which has led to a setback in the market and a loss of morale. The bulls feel very uninteresting.</p>
<p>In the morning, the tight money market overnight had an impact, and the secret interest rate rose sharply. The daily interest rate was as high as 85-95 yuan, and such a heavy interest threat was a major blow to the stock market. As a result, the bulls fell, the shorts raised their heads, and the selling pressure in the market suddenly increased, causing the market to plummet.</p>
<p>Yongsheng yarn opened in the morning with a low of 7.23 yuan. After the scattered shorts made up, it rose slightly to 7.33 yuan and 7.36 yuan. Hearing the news that the Central Bank was selling gold, people in the industry were broken and unbearable. Most of the major players were watching, and the situation was cold. The intermediate fluctuations were narrow, and it was in a low-level plague market all the way. Later, the external gold prices plummeted, and the money market in the market was tight. The scheduling was quite stagnant. The Jinye gang and the Banking gang were arranging funds and selling continuously, making the market even more unsustainable. It fell to 6.92 yuan and finally closed at 6.68 yuan at noon.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks opened flat in the morning. The support on the table was very strong in the middle, and once created a peak in the tired market, but the pull-up behind the scenes was very weak. At the noon close, they all fell back because the overall situation was soft. Xinyi, Tongyi, Jinglun, Qinxing, and underwear all opened flat and closed lower. Xinguang, Jingfu, and Meiya once strengthened after opening, but fell back at the noon close. The rest of the miscellaneous brands were sluggish. The total turnover of the city was 5.354 billion yuan, 545,000 shares.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Foreign Stocks are Tired, Gold Bonds are Flat <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The foreign stock market turned from rising to falling yesterday. The money market turned tight. The stock market sentiment was stronger. The market was weak at the noon close. Yisha was 15,200 yuan to 15,500 yuan, Yinglian was 23,000 yuan out, Yeguang was 5,500 yuan out, and Jardine Matheson was 60,000 yuan. All fell sharply.</p>
<p>The gold public debt was supported by the households yesterday, but the buying was not strong and the trading was quite deserted. It opened at 360,000 yuan in the morning, but there were no takers. The asking price fell slightly by 5,000 yuan. After falling to a low of 351,000 yuan, the selling pressure was still strong, and it continued to fall slightly to 351,000 yuan. Then it rose again to 355,000 yuan at the noon close. The after-market initially traded at 350,000 yuan, then fell slightly to 340,000 yuan. Finally, it closed at 250,000 yuan, with a turnover of 81 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Continued Shrinking of Hong Kong Exchange Rates <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong exchange rate opened at 1,004.2 yuan per thousand this morning, and closed at 1,004.3 yuan per thousand last night. The Gold Yuan opened at 1,005 yuan per thousand this morning, and closed at 1,005.2 yuan per thousand last night. The Hong Kong gold price opened at 313.75 yuan per tael this morning, and closed at 312.5 yuan per tael last night.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar telegraphic transfer opened at 5.26 yuan this morning, unchanged from the previous close. The U.S. dollar forward exchange opened at 5.24 yuan this morning, compared to the previous close of 5.22 yuan. U.S. dollar banknotes opened at 5.24 yuan this morning, and closed at 5.21 yuan last night.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollar Banknotes</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar banknote opened at 11,115 this morning, and closed at 10,300 yuan and 10,400 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it was 11,100 yuan and 11,200 yuan.</p>

<p>The Market's Response Aims at an Even Narrower Target: High Interest Rates Still Favor Frequent Fluctuations</p>
<p>The general market is fully demonstrating a state of adaptation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's opening trend was soft, giving the central bank ample face.</p>
<p>The stock market is still sluggish, which is a natural phenomenon during a period of adaptation. However, missing an opportunity yesterday may actually benefit those switching from stocks to gold; it's hard to say.</p>
<p>During this time of new political arrangements, everyone is being extra cautious. In the past, moments of uncertainty would always bring about excitement. Now, it's quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Going short or going long, there used to be a principle of "taking profits as soon as possible," fearing complications later on. Now, there's a tendency to prefer inaction over action, fearing the end of the night and the breaking of dreams. Truly, this is a different time.</p>
<p>However, the regular trends should not be forgotten. It's almost time to knock out goods a week in advance and release interest payments in preparation for month-end positions.</p>
<p>Being in a state of adaptation, gold, banknotes, silver dollars, rice, and coal – these five major targets – should be the focus of everyone's attention. The central bank is manipulating gold and banknotes. Silver dollars usually see more outflow than inflow, except during payroll periods. Therefore, the situation for the two major necessities of life, rice and coal, will become increasingly tense.</p>
<p>The soaring prices of rice and coal in recent days have already caused panic among citizens. However, when converted to gold prices, they are still lagging behind.</p>
<p>However, those who have been buying gold, banknotes, and silver dollars these past few days, when compared with releasing interest, are all losing money. For example, the closing gold price the day before yesterday was 547,500 yuan per tael. Based on the 0.55% daily interest rate on that day, the total principal and interest for yesterday should have been 577,600 yuan. However, the market price dropped to 518,500, effectively losing over 10% of the principal and interest.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Rice Prices Continue to Soar: Special Japonica Rice Reaches a High of 68,000 Yuan; Flour Stops Rising and Falls; Cooking Oil Rises Again <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Rice prices rose considerably yesterday. Because the previous day's increase was insufficient, sellers raised prices. In addition, Wuxi reported price increases, and the rain further solidified their sentiment. In the northern market, white japonica and thin indica rice both reached 65,000 yuan, up 7,000 yuan each. Special japonica rice reached a high of 68,000 yuan. In the southern market, the initial increase was 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, but due to tight credit in the central market, it retreated slightly by 1,000 yuan. Thin indica rice was at 63,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan. However, the close was weak in many places. Total arrivals in the two markets amounted to 4,385 shi (石).</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Rose again. Due to the rising rice prices and solid market sentiment, sellers immediately raised prices. However, due to tight credit, the close turned soft. Soybean oil opened at 250,000 yuan, with the highest being 256,000 yuan, closing at 254,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil also rose 10,000 yuan, closing at 239,000 yuan. Good barrel rapeseed oil was at 345,000 yuan, also up 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake trading was clear, with prices slightly higher.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Stopped rising and fell. In the early market, credit was relatively stable. Rice prices continued to rise, and various brands of flour once increased. Later, after hearing that the central bank was releasing a large number of gold bars, credit immediately tightened, and the market steadily declined. Lao Che (老車) flour last traded at 22,400 yuan. Bing Chuan (兵船) flour last traded at 21,380 yuan. Bran once reached a high of 18,000 yuan, but also saw a decline at the close. Large-package Fuxin flour was at 17,950 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Closed early. In the early market, credit was still stable. Sesame was strongly absorbed by the Dasheng Oil Factory, with a sharp increase of over 20%. Yellow hemp and milk hemp all broke 100,000 yuan. Groundnut and soybeans were affected by tight credit in the later market, and the market rose first and then fell, still seeing a squeezed increase compared to yesterday. Corn and red sorghum sold quite smoothly, each up about 10%.</p>

<p>Due to sellers uniformly wanting to add interest, the woolen fabric market, although without any special large fluctuations, still saw all prices gradually rise towards a peak. Actual sales weakened accordingly. The trading of green serge was especially quiet. Sellers suddenly decreased, and factory production was temporarily suspended, sharply reduced to minimal levels. The price was far more reasonable than other colored woolen fabrics.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Central Bank Seeks to Ease Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the central bank increased the amount of cash that banks could withdraw from 10% to 12%.</p>
<p>According to sources within the bank, this limit will be gradually increased depending on actual conditions, potentially reaching as high as 20% to 30%.</p>
<p>It is believed that the cash withdrawal limit, under current circumstances, can at least control the amount of deposits borrowed by banks and reduce the pressure on commodity prices. After the cash withdrawal limit, it will also help to tighten issuance. Yesterday, approximately 1 billion yuan of 500-yuan notes were issued, slightly less than in previous days.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Southern Shipment Quotas for Yarn and Cloth <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Statistics for Private Factories in March</p>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that the March southern shipment quota for privately-owned factories under the Shanghai Cotton Textile Association is 4,600 bales of cotton yarn and 136,000 bolts of cotton cloth. As of the 15th of this month, 43 factories had applied for southern shipment of cotton yarn, with an original quota of 3,174 bales (2,901 bales applied for shipment by the 21st, and 273 bales had not yet applied for shipment). 21 factories requested to reserve a quota, totaling 1,040 bales, and 28 factories abandoned their quotas, totaling 386 bales.</p>
<p>63,292 bolts of cotton cloth had been applied for southern shipment, with 42,800 bolts still awaiting shipment application. Eight factories requested to reserve a quota, totaling 23,932 bolts, and three factories abandoned their quotas, totaling 5,234 bolts.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Uniform Drop in Cotton Yarn; Cloth Market Nervous <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a slump as tight credit within the industry (daily interest rates above 80 yuan) dampened the enthusiasm of buyers. Sellers, however, were unwilling to release their goods due to cost considerations, causing trading within the market to become sluggish. All yarns closed with weak prices.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 3.8 million yuan, the closing price from the previous afternoon. After once rising to 3.85 million yuan, it fell to 3.73 million yuan, a decrease of 70,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix slightly fell by 10,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at 2.58 million yuan, once rising to the closing price of the previous afternoon, but ultimately fell to 2.56 million yuan due to weak support, a drop of 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>22-count Double Horse initially opened near the 2 million yuan mark. Then, upon hearing that goods outside the industry were weak and sentiment was poor, the price retreated to 1.87 million yuan. There was a slight rally before the close, recovering to 1.89 million yuan, a decrease of 50,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse fell from 1.85 million yuan to 1.8 million yuan, a drop of 60,000 yuan. In addition, Jincheng and Tiannu followed the downward trend.</p>
<p>The cloth market suddenly saw a downturn. Tightening credit, a uniform drop outside the industry, and the opening of shipments from the textile construction company all contributed to the nervous sentiment. Retailers, unable to bear the burden of high interest rates, rushed to sell. The selling pressure was intense near noon, and all cloths saw price decreases.</p>
<p>Dragon Head Fine Cloth rose from 85,000 yuan to a high of 88,500 yuan. As the close approached, the situation turned weak, and it ultimately closed low at 80,000 yuan, a decrease of 4,000 yuan. Trumpet Child and Friend B Dragon Head Fine Cloth each fell by about 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge initially opened at 76,000 yuan, once rising to 76,700 yuan before reversing course. The lowest price reached 72,600 yuan, and it ultimately closed at 73,000 yuan, a decrease of 2,800 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Serge slightly fell by 1,000 yuan. Private factories, due to cost considerations, uniformly increased prices for goods such as Shilin Cloth and Poplin. Among them, 190 high-end Shilin had already reached 170,000 yuan, but direct sales remained weak, with little actual trading.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Four Mining Companies Joint Office adjusted coal prices yesterday. The new prices for each grade of fuel coal are as follows: Keelung coal 130,420 yuan per ton, Kailuan bituminous coal 147,230 yuan, foreign bituminous coal 312,930 yuan.</p>
<p>It is also understood that only 26,000 tons of Kailuan bituminous coal arrived this month, one-half the planned amount. It is said that the original plan was for two to four ships to regularly travel between North China and Shanghai, each capable of carrying approximately 8,000 tons of coal. Currently, only one ship is transporting, resulting in a large shortfall in coal deliveries compared to the planned target.</p>

<p>Yesterday's artificial silk market was weak. Credit was tight, gold prices outside the industry were severely depressed, and sentiment turned soft. Sellers were eager to release their goods for cash, and selling pressure was strong.</p>
<p>No. 120 bright new silk opened at 2.4 million, and immediately weakened, falling to 2.31 million before closing at 2.32 million at noon. In the afternoon, credit eased slightly, but sentiment remained weak. It initially opened at 2.3 million, then fell to 2.25 million.</p>
<p>Raw silk foreign exchange certificates saw a slight rise, but tight credit made it difficult for sellers to bear the burden, and they were still eager to release their goods. Superior grade Other Load opened at 3.6 million. Buying interest was stagnant after the opening, and selling interest increased on the trading floor. The market was watching and waiting, and it fell to 3.5 million near noon. The trend remained soft in the afternoon, with inconsistent prices. It was first quoted at 3.45 million, then 3.41 million.</p>
<p>Dacheng Silk Satin Bedding initially opened at a high of 1.7 million. After the opening, the overall trend softened, and the trading floor failed to provide support. Tightening credit further pushed the market down, reaching a low of 1.65 million. Short sellers covered their positions, and there was a slight rebound before the close, closing at 1,667,000 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it was quoted at 1.63 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Rainproof Cloth Sells Well <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Rainproof cloth has been quite popular recently. Products from various factories, such as Yousheng, Shanghai, and Feilong brands, have been in high demand due to the increased sales opportunities created by the rainy weather. On the price front, prices have risen due to the high prices of raw yarn and the reorganization fees for the cost of living index. Yesterday, the transaction price per yard at the rainproof cloth tea party was 8,000 yuan for No. 1, 7,250 yuan for No. 2, and 6,600 yuan for No. 3.</p>

<p>Although the tung oil market was squeezed by tight credit and rising market interest rates yesterday, it followed the movements of foreign exchange transfer certificate market prices throughout the process, gradually advancing, with increases ranging from 5,000 to 30,000 yuan. However, transaction volumes remained scarce. This is because foreign market prices were weak, and domestic spring sales have not yet started, making it difficult to boost buying interest. Under these circumstances, it is likely that clarity will be difficult to achieve in the short term.</p>

<p>The cigarette market continued to see a downward trend. Yesterday, Yongtaihe's announcement of shipping goods further tightened credit, and there were even fewer buyers. Trading was flat, and the market continued to weaken. White Tin Package 8,700 yuan, Three Cannons 6,700 yuan, Ten-pack Qianmen 6,250 yuan, Twenty-pack Qianmen 4,800 yuan, Ten-pack Great Britain 7,400 yuan, Twenty-pack Great Britain 3,060 yuan, Ten-pack Old Knife 2,200 yuan, Twenty-pack Old Knife 2,500 yuan, Beauty 4,600 yuan, Golden Mouse 2,250 yuan, Bank 3,330 yuan, Brandy 3,250 yuan, Red Gaole 3,250 yuan, 35 Brand 8,900 yuan.</p>
<p>The commodity market initially saw a sharp rise yesterday morning, then fell sharply. At the opening, major players sharply increased their purchases, and sellers uniformly raised prices. Later, upon hearing that gold and banknotes were weak, speculators closed out their positions. Additionally, tightening credit and major players selling back resulted in a sharp fall after the close. Solid Root reached a high of 86,000-87,000 yuan, then traded at 80,000 yuan. Beauty Matches initially traded at 350,000-360,000 yuan, then traded in the 330,000 yuan range.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Shanghai Industrial Association Releases Overview of the City's Paper Box Industry <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Technical Committee of the Shanghai Industrial Association released an overview of the paper box industry yesterday as follows: Shanghai began to imitate paper box production after trade with foreign countries opened. However, at that time, there were no paperboard products, and only rough materials such as grass paper lined with San Ding Dalian paper were used to make the board. Only industries such as ginseng, bird's nest, Chinese medicine, and fragrant powder used boxes to hold items, and the usage was quite small. Around 1920, domestic paperboard factories such as Huacheng and Huafeng were established one after another, but production was not high. The first industries to extensively use boxes were Western medicine, followed by knitted underwear, shoes, and candy. Now, their use is becoming increasingly widespread, adopted by all industries.</p>
<p>The paper box production process initially involved using a horseshoe-shaped knife to manually cut the blank, score lines, and glue on thin paper to form the box. Recently, due to the increasing demand from industries such as rubber, cigarettes, and food, and the refinement of decoration, machines have gradually been adopted for manufacturing. The manufacturing process is briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Machine-made boxes: First, the paperboard is backed with white paper, then the trademark or brand address is printed. Then, the box blank is cut according to the printed lines. Finally, it is nailed with lead wire. However, only a small number of companies in the city, no more than ten or so, use machines with motor equipment.</p>
<p>(2) Handmade boxes: First, domestic yellow paperboard is used to line the inside, cut into square pieces according to the size of the box, and scored with fold lines. Then, the blank is assembled and covered with colored paper to form the outside layer. Handmade boxes are divided into various shapes such as square, round, and angular, as well as decorated with brocade, silk, and rosewood. The procedures are extremely complex, and the types are very numerous. Currently, there are approximately 300 companies in the industry. The reason why they have not yet switched to machines is due to the severe housing shortage since the victory of the war and the inability to increase the production of domestic paper materials. If machine paper materials can be produced in large quantities and widely promoted, the industry will have a hope for development in the future.</p>
<p>Paper boxes are mostly manufactured and consumed locally. Those sold abroad are only for export goods, as auxiliary decorative items.</p>
<p>The main raw materials are yellow paperboard, white paperboard, newspaper, kraft paper, and all kinds of colored paper. Before the war, the majority was supplied by foreign goods. In recent years, various domestic paper materials have gradually become more refined and are sufficient to replace them, but they are still not completely self-sufficient. Since this industry is a type of reprocessed product industry, it has not yet been able to directly purchase raw materials. Regardless of yellow paperboard or fine paper, it is entirely dependent on paper merchants. The price is high due to multiple rounds of buying and selling, and the cost is high, resulting in the complete elimination of the profit that should be earned. This is also a hidden pain and regret of the industry.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Last Night's Basketball Game Was Extraordinarily Tense; Huili Fought Hard, Renyu Lost Color; An Intense Battle Between Enkas and McLings Decided by One Point in Overtime <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Last night's basketball league program was extraordinarily tense. In the final game, the Huili team defeated the Renyu team 52-43, with the score at halftime being 19-17. Renyu started strong but weakened later. In the first half, the two sides were evenly matched, with only a two-point difference. However, in the second half, Cao Zhiji's consecutive scores for Huili undoubtedly dealt Renyu a blow. Due to the tension of the situation, their actions also became noticeably fiery, indirectly giving Huili a lot of free throw opportunities. As for the frequent adjustments, it also seemed to be a miscalculation. Huili was in exceptional form last night, with Cao, Wang, and Tian being particularly outstanding. For Renyu, Xu Zhongsi and Cai Jindian were relatively active.</p>
<p>In another game in Group A, Enkas and McLings tied at 35 at the end of regulation. In the five-minute overtime, Enkas won 44-42 by two points. In Group C, Meiqi Xiang defeated Pei'er 39-35.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the headline battle between Huili and Renyu, which didn't start until 8 p.m. The Huili starting five were Cao Zhiji, Wei Xu, Ye Zhenshan, Wang Yongfang, and Tian Fuliu. Renyu responded with Sun Guozheng, Xu Zhongsi, Li Zhaohe, Wang Huaixing, and Shen Pengju. In the opening jump ball, Renyu immediately took the offensive. Yongfang committed a foul, and Zhaohe made the first free throw. Huili players Fuhai and Zhiji had bad luck. Guozheng and Yunshan each scored, and Zhongsi also jumped up and scored. Yongfang made two free throws, and Renyu was still in the lead 5-4. Then, both sides committed fouls, Zhongsi made it, Fuhai missed, and Shen Pengju added two more points. Huili called a timeout at 8-4. Renyu substituted Ye Jindian for Huaixing. Three minutes of back-and-forth fighting yielded nothing, and Renyu also called a timeout. Huili's luck turned around. Fuhai and Yongfang scored on two free throws, tying the score at 8. Pengju scored one point to take the lead, and Jindian rushed forward, putting the ball into the basket. Huili made a long pass, and Fuhai unexpectedly broke out on his own, and Yongfang made a highlight play. Huili took the lead 12-11. After Guozheng tied the score, Huaixing replaced him, and Wu Xinyun replaced Jindian. It soon became tied at 14. Cai Wu restored the original situation, Yunshan and Fuhai made free throws, and Yongfang also shot. At halftime, Huili was ahead 19-17.</p>
<p>The game was quite attractive, drawing about 3,000 fans. The second half continued. Zhiji showed his prowess at the start. Renyu's Jindian retaliated with a basket, but Lao Cao returned. The score was 25-20. Yao Wenyi replaced Zhongsi with silk. Cao continued to throw and free throw, and his momentum increased. The score was 28-22. Xinyun replaced Huaixing. Huili had many free throw opportunities. Renyu was busy adjusting its players. Soon, the score was 38-22. Renyu was behind by 16 points, and it looked bleak. Afterwards, although Jindian and Zhongsi tried their best to fight hard, it was all in vain. Finally, Huili replaced Wang Yongfang with Chen Zhengmiao, and ultimately won 52-43.</p>

<p>Mei-Pei Game</p>
<p>In the Group C game between Pei'er and the American Meteorological Team, Pei'er was disorganized before the game and was late to the court. After the game started, they initially led, but soon saw several tall players from the Meteorological Team moving freely under the basket. The Meteorological Team trailed 21-15 in the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, Hu Jiazhang of Pei'er scored several consecutive baskets, bringing the score to 23-22, within half a point. It was quite impressive. At ten minutes, the score was tied at 27. Pei'er then added a free throw, and the situation changed. After a period of scrambling, the Meteorological Team regained the lead, and ultimately won 39-35. Pei'er lost.</p>

<p>En-Mai Game</p>
<p>In the makeup game between McLings and Enkas, the En team first scored three points. Que Li and Qiu Qu continued to attack, and the score soon became 8-1. In an energetic performance by both teams, McLings's Gao Folai and another player were unusually well-matched, and the score steadily increased, even exceeding Enkas at one point. At halftime, Enkas was ahead 19-17.</p>
<p>After the break, McLings scored four consecutive points, and dozens of teammates in the stands shouted and cheered. But the situation often changed, going up and down unpredictably. When McLings led 27-22, Enkas saw that the situation was unfavorable, and Kai Jie Miluofu personally took the field, bringing in the fat boy Qiu. The game remained tense. En team's Ao Chailiao and Que Li were determined to fight hard. In the last two minutes, the score was tied at 35. In the five-minute overtime, a final victory had to be decided. Que Li threw in the first ball from the crowd. Both sides committed fouls. En made it, and McL missed. Then, McLings's Gao Folai and the opponent's Que Li each scored a basket. Liss made a free throw, and En team's Bo Tou Gai made a free throw. McLings's Lai Mu Shan made a shot, but missed a free throw, still one point short. In the last minute, Bo Tou added three points, and Gao Folai also made it, but was still two points short. Enkas ultimately won 44-42.</p>

<p>— Translated by Qi Yi</p>
<p>When learning to use a shifting zone defense, the defender must absolutely stand within strategically important areas, specifically within the mid-range shooting distance of the attacker. This is 100% correct, and even advanced players using this method should adhere to this principle. Only leave the defensive zone to intercept the opponent's pass when you are confident you have a foolproof opportunity. Remember, practice makes perfect. Once you've practiced enough to use it smoothly, players will know when intercepting an attacker's pass will be effective.</p>
<p>Beginner basketball players should be warned against indiscriminately leaving the area they are defending to intercept an attacker's pass. This can easily lead to personal fouls or inaccurate footwork, causing them to run past the ball. A disorganized defensive position gives the attacker a great advantage.</p>
<p>The previous section explained that defenders should not lightly leave the area they are defending, but it should not be taken as an absolute rule. Remember, defending is about pure defense, and defenders should not take risky gambles.</p>
<p>Defenders attempting to intercept passes across the center line are most prone to fouls and footwork errors. To counter passes over the center line, use a different defensive approach. Defenders must be agile and have a sense of anticipation, taking defensive positions before the opposing guard even passes the ball over the center line. Below are two formations for defending against passes over the center line.</p>
<p>(1) (See Diagram 11) This type of defense requires coordination between the guard and the forward to be effective. When the opposing guard gains possession, the three attackers on the offensive side should immediately stand side-by-side in a line near the center line, leaving no gaps. The left and right guards move forward to the center line, filling in the gaps, while the center guard retreats to the edge of the key to guard against attackers receiving the ball and breaking through. This is essentially setting up a zone defense in the mid-court. The opposing guard cannot use short passes to cross the center line; a long pass is the only option, but long passes are easily intercepted.</p>
<p>Attackers should watch the ball-handling guard as they prepare to make a short pass near the free-throw line. They should then rush forward to intercept the pass, with the two guards covering them. This pressure on the guard may cause them to panic and fail to pass the ball, or they may be forced into a jump ball or have the ball intercepted. (To be continued - VII)</p>
<h3 id="e171">Women's Basketball Circle <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Jie</p>
<p>Based on the current women's league standings, I should talk about the 'Li Team.'</p>
<p>The predecessor of the Li Team was the Frontline Team, and the Frontline Team was a mixed team of the Women's Youth Purple and the Youth League. When the Frontline Team disbanded, the Youth League players went to the Star China Team, and the Women's Youth Purple players became the Li Team. So, the current Li Team is equivalent to the former Women's Youth Purple, minus Zhu Jin Yun. Therefore, judging by the history and experience of the Women's Youth Purple, their current record can be considered quite an achievement. By 'quite an achievement' I mean second only to the Green Team in this league, even surpassing the Star China Team, which has four city representatives. Isn't that a good achievement?</p>
<p>The team is constantly working hard to improve its methods. During the Women's Youth Purple era, they were coached by Wu Shi Jian, and during the Frontline Team era, Cai Tong Ke took over. Indeed, the coaches taught diligently, and the players learned attentively. They tried their best to use the methods during matches. Naturally, they were clumsy at first, but gradually became more skilled, and their performance improved accordingly. Furthermore, I recently discovered a characteristic of the Li Team players: they watch a lot of games. It can be said that they always come to the gymnasium when there is a match. We should realize that it is very beneficial for players to watch more games. They can learn from the strengths of others and use them as their own blueprint. Watching more games can also increase their experience in battle. Therefore, the Li Team has recently been watching games constantly and has already benefited from it to some extent.</p>
<p>In terms of using methods, the Li Team may be more serious than the Green Team. However, their lineup has a clear weakness: they are too short and seem to lack strength. Therefore, they lack a rushing and decisive power, which makes it difficult to fully display their abilities. For example, the Qian Chu Ping and Qian You Ping sisters can shoot baskets and have good evasive skills, but they are so petite and weak that they are easily marked by their opponents. There is also the forward Yao Si Lian, who is better than her sister Yao Si Yuan, who belongs to the Star China Team. Her mid-range shooting, in particular, can be said to be up to standard, but she also lacks strength and high speed, so she cannot display the qualities of an ideal forward. Here, I recall that the team used to have a good forward named Zeng Zhao Qing, who was indeed an ideal candidate. She studied at Qi Xiu School, but the school doctor said she had an illness and could not exercise, so she had to stop playing basketball. This was indeed a loss for the Li Team. (Note: Zeng Zhao Qing has now returned to her hometown of Xiamen).</p>
<p>Here, I have discovered further evidence that a women's basketball forward must have the talent for short-distance running to have the high-speed burst needed to threaten opponents. For example, the Green Team's Huang Ming Yuan, Shi Zong Lan, and Zhu Jin Yun are considered the three best female sprinters in Shanghai. Therefore, when the three of them play as forwards, they can use their speed like butterflies flitting through flowers, and they put on excellent performances. In contrast, the Li Team's three young players do not have this ability. Therefore, although they have good shooting skills and know how to strategize, they have not achieved the results they hoped for. I hope they can work hard to improve in this area.</p>
<p>As for the Li Team's defensive strength, Chen Wen Yan is quite impressive, but the other two are relatively inexperienced, so their performance in battle is hurried and not as good as expected. This is a process that players must go through. After a period of time, they will definitely be able to enter the hall of fame, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Overall, the Li Team has already defeated Star China, so there is naturally high hope that they will take second place in this competition, or at least tie with the Star China Team for second place. Comparing everything about them with Star China, they can live up to their hard work. Naturally, we hope they can go one step further. What I mean is that they must improve in terms of physical strength and gain experience. Then, a bright future is to be expected. I hope the young players of the Li Team will strive for it!</p>
<p>Li Team lineup: From right to left (back row): Xu Mu Ben, Chen Yu Qin, Chen Wen Yan, Cai Ming Xia, Quan Li Li, Xu Hui Ru, (front row): Niu Yun Juan, Yao Si Lian, Qian Chu Ping, Qian You Ping, Zhu Cui Di, Li Yao Ying.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Women's Sports Issues <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Xiu Rong</p>
<p>(1) The Current State of Women's Sports</p>
<p>Since the introduction of European and American culture to China, sports have gradually been recognized as an important field. In China, women's sports have been promoted for more than 30 years and appear to be thriving on the surface. Looking at the women's track and field records, ball skills, and participation rates in recent years, it seems that women's sports have been widely promoted. However, with closer observation and understanding, it is easy to discover the problems: either excessive obsession with competitive sports or neglect and disregard. The general public's view of women's sports can be roughly divided into two categories: 1. The Obstinate Faction – They still hold feudal ideas, believing that women should still be delicate to be considered beautiful, a morbid concept of beauty. Women should not engage in the same activities as men. In schools, generally stubborn and conservative administrators often do not know what sports are. Not only do schools lack general sports facilities, but the selection of physical education teachers and the implementation of sports courses are also perfunctory and superficial. Sports are neglected and disregarded. 2. The Radical Faction – Overly obsessed with competitive sports, leading to abnormal development. Many institutions, schools, or individuals spare no expense to support a few athletes as tools for publicity. Some even value sports for the sake of winning championships, harming the health of women's sports.</p>
<p>All of this leads to abnormal development in sports, with a lack of exercise or championship-oriented sports, completely deviating from the meaning of sports. In the current era, the training and development of body and mind through sports has been generally recognized. The obstinate faction that opposes women's sports should be eliminated by the times, but championship-oriented sports should also be strictly corrected. The meaning of sports competitions is originally only to promote and encourage skills, stimulate interest, and observe techniques. If it harms the normal development of the body, it completely violates the true meaning of sports. Normal sports should provide widespread training based on women's physical and mental health, their athletic ability, and their mental training, strengthening physical fitness and promoting a courageous and lively spirit. It must help create the talent needed by the times and train the women needed by modern society, so that sports do not lose their meaning in education.</p>
<p>(2) Physiological Issues of Women's Sports</p>
<p>Women are the mothers of future generations, and their physical strength is the foundation for the health of future children. Therefore, to transform the physique of the entire nation, the physical training of women, who bear the responsibility of reproduction, is extremely important. However, women's physique differs physiologically from men's. Their body, respiratory organs, and blood circulation differ significantly from men's. Anatomically, the differences between the sexes are roughly three points: (1) After adolescence, women's pelvises obviously widen, causing femoral obliquity. In all lower limb movements, their pelvises tend to sway from side to side. The greater the sway, the greater the resistance to forward speed. The main reason women's running ability is inferior to men's is this. (2) Due to the need for reproduction, women's bodies are proportionally longer, with a larger height coefficient than men's. In addition, the pelvis is enlarged, resulting in a lower center of gravity. (3) Women have less muscle and more fat than men. Therefore, although women's physical strength is not as good as men's, their hidden potential is often greater than men's. Based on the above reasons, due to the physiological differences between the sexes, their sports standards should also be differentiated to suit women's health.</p>
<p>(3) Women and Sports</p>
<p>(1) Women and General Strength Exercises – The importance of total muscle mass, according to Europeans, is on average 24.5 grams for men and 14.75 grams for women. The ratio to total body weight is 10 for men and 9 for women. However, the ratio of muscle weight is 10 for men and only 6 for women. Furthermore, women's lives, whether in the home or serving society, generally do not require large muscles. Given their gentle nature, women are not well-suited to general strength exercises such as wrestling, boxing, or weightlifting.</p>
<p>(2) Agile Exercises – Women's upper limbs are shorter relative to their trunks than men's. Because women's center of gravity is lower than men's, agile exercises such as hanging, climbing, handstands, and rotations are generally unnecessary for women.</p>
<p>(3) Dance – Women have greater body stability than men. Therefore, they are best suited for activities that require a lot of dance, especially in terms of providing vitality and enjoyment.</p>
<p>(4) Gymnastics – Swedish and Danish gymnastics, with movements that are not too intense and are rhythmic, are suitable exercises for women. However, jumping and hanging movements should be reduced in intensity compared to men.</p>
<p>(5) Swimming – According to most physical education experts, swimming is indeed the most suitable exercise for women. Swimming movements are even and not too strenuous. Women's bodies float easily in the water and are more tolerant of the cold. In addition, women generally like swimming.</p>
<p>(6) Ball Sports – Indoor baseball is extremely popular, with smaller hitting and throwing forces, and can be considered an appropriate exercise. Tennis movements are graceful and suited to women's preferences. Volleyball is suitable for women. Table tennis, if practiced moderately, is also a suitable exercise.</p>
<p>(7) Track and Field – All track and field exercises, if practiced carefully and cautiously, can be of great benefit to women's bodies and minds. However, long-distance running is not suitable in terms of physical strength.</p>
<p>(8) Other Various Exercises – (A) Cycling – Can be considered a suitable exercise if done without overexertion. (B) Rowing – If done competitively, it requires great physical strength and is not very suitable. However, free rowing can develop the chest and upper limbs and is a suitable physical exercise. (C) Mountain climbing and hiking – Can be considered extremely suitable exercises for women. These exercises do not require momentary great physical strength and are very interesting. In addition, sports such as ice skating and skiing are also suitable for women.</p>
<p>(4) Future Trends in Women's Sports</p>
<p>In the future, women's sports must not aim to achieve its purpose by training in a few skills. Its training core should be expanded to the entire life. Based on the principles of physical and mental health, universal, collective, and rigorous training should be implemented to wash away the delicate, lazy, and slow movements of the past, and move towards a healthy, agile, brave, hardworking, and determined path with a spirit of striving for independence.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Salary Devaluation "Branch" Notes <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Dong</p>
<p>From the ringing of the telephone to the news in the newspaper, it was confirmed that civil servants' salaries for March would be paid on the 15th.</p>
<p>There was an immediate commotion in the office, and everyone seemed a little uneasy. The 15th! Isn't that tomorrow?</p>
<p>The topic of conversation among colleagues was all about this. Even the usually taciturn section chief couldn't help but join in the conversation from time to time.</p>
<p>Old Shen was calculating the use of this income, because his home was still on the other side of the river, and now communication and news had long been cut off. So, he lived alone in the public dormitory, and could only buy a little bit of small-sized materials to store. The last time the water and electricity bill was paid, prices had already risen very high. He thought it would stop eventually, so he didn't buy anything. As a result, he took a big discount and spent it all piecemeal. He wanted to make a decision this time. As soon as he got the money, he would go to buy something. But he wanted to buy something that would be easier to buy and sell, and not too big. He decided to buy a few Yuan silver dollars.</p>
<p>Although the cost of living index for civil servants has reached more than 1,000 times, civil service salaries are only 225 times higher. He couldn't help but feel a little injustice and complained in his heart. But this time, it was twice as much as last month. Moreover, after the index is released at the end of the month, he can get a one-time supplement. Last month, he got 7,500 yuan. This time, three fives are fifteen, three sevens are twenty-one, so he can get 22,500 yuan. Deducting 5,000 yuan for half a month's food and 1,000 yuan for donations, he can net more than 16,000 yuan. At the current market price, he can buy four silver dollars. He decided to go buy them as soon as he got the money.</p>
<p>The next day, in the office, the colleagues' topic of conversation was still about "waist water." Two who had families in Shanghai were even more anxious than ants on a hot pot. However, the morning passed peacefully after all, but there was no news. In the afternoon, the guard at the gate was released, waiting for the jeep to arrive from the bank to collect the money, so they could get the money first. But they waited until the end of office hours in the afternoon, and there was still no news. Some colleagues who were more well-informed said: The money market is tight today, and they are afraid that they won't be able to get cash. At the same time, news of rising prices kept coming. Rice broke the 40,000 mark, and the silver dollars were close to 5,000.</p>
<p>The 16th and 17th days passed in tension, anticipation, and anxiety. The price of rice was 45,000, and then it exceeded 50,000. The silver dollars rose from more than 5,000 to 6,400 yuan. However, the people who went to the bank to collect the money said that they had only received copper plates and could not exchange them for cash. A colleague waited impatiently and went to the bank in person to see what was going on. He came back and reported that the bank staff were also in a hurry and had no way to deal with it. They bowed and apologized to the people from various institutions who came to collect the money and said: We really can't get so much cash today. Even if you kill us, it will be useless. We will definitely find a way to pay tomorrow. However, the people who came to collect the money were still unwilling to leave. After a while, they agreed to issue 30% in cash and 70% in drafts. However, everyone knew that drafts needed to be discounted if they were used on the market, so they didn't agree.</p>
<p>In the office, everyone had not dispersed by 5:00 pm. This was unprecedented. Disappointment, resentment, curses, and even some barbaric laughter and scolding, and intense proposals filled the small room. Just as they were feeling helpless, good news finally arrived: the cash had been collected, but it was too late. Come early tomorrow. Then everyone deflated like a balloon and dispersed like birds and beasts.</p>
<p>The net saving of 16,000 yuan was finally obtained the next day. They were neat stacks of new purple banknotes, and they made a "hissing" sound when counted. There were thirty-two in total.</p>
<p>After leaving a small amount for pocket money, he bought two silver dollars - half of what he had budgeted.</p>
<p>In the early morning, everyone read the "Salary Devaluation Notes" in the Free Talk, and couldn't help but smile knowingly. So, on a whim, he picked up a pen and wrote this "Branch" note.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Birds Also Know Medicine <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Kang Shi</p>
<p>I read Bai Xiangshan's poem: "Deer chew bean sprouts to detoxify aconite, magpies carry artemisia leaves to seize swallow nests. Birds and beasts have never seen the herbal, who taught them to know the medicinal properties?"</p>
<p>According to the hunters, the arrows they use often use aconite poison. If a deer is hit by an arrow, it will often find bean sprouts to chew on to detoxify itself.</p>
<p>When magpies want to seize swallow nests, they often first carry a sprig of artemisia leaves and place it on top of the nest. The swallows are afraid and avoid it, and the magpies occupy the nest. This is because swallows hate artemisia leaves.</p>
<p>Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs and learned their medicinal properties, but birds and beasts are also able to know them, using bean sprouts to detoxify arrow poison and artemisia leaves as weapons. Their cleverness is no less than that of humans, which is indeed amazing.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Gold Yuan and Tin Foil <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuo Zhi</p>
<p>Because Qingming Festival is approaching, I went to buy a thousand sheets of tin foil yesterday for use at the tomb. Chinese people have always valued their ancestors in the underworld more than the living. Although I don't really believe in this, I went to buy them because my wife urged me to. I asked, and a thousand sheets of tin foil actually cost 5,400 Gold Yuan, averaging more than five yuan per sheet.</p>
<p>At this point, I couldn't help but feel emotional. The Gold Yuan is already so worthless that it can't even be used in the underworld. Holding this thick stack of banknotes that was exchanged for such a thin piece of tin foil, I suddenly thought on the way home that the Central Bank is trying its best to overcome its timidity. Why doesn't it use its brains on this?</p>
<p>With Qingming Festival approaching, the amount of tin foil burned in Shanghai, and even across the country, must be considerable. If the Central Bank could come up with a way to make the common people (especially the old women) believe that our Gold Yuan can also be used in the underworld and has not depreciated at all, with every four yuan still able to be exchanged for one US dollar, and every two hundred yuan able to be exchanged for one small yellow croaker, then people would naturally no longer be willing to spend more than 5,000 Gold Yuan to buy a thousand sheets of tin foil, but instead directly burn the banknotes to their loved ones in the underworld. In this way, the Central Bank can invisibly recover (because others burned it for you) a large amount of currency, without having to release gold or silver dollars at all. Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>I think this is not difficult to do. The Central Bank can immediately set up a propaganda office in addition to its current departments. In terms of personnel, it should first contact witch doctors and monks and Taoists across the country to actively promote that the underworld has adopted the Gold Yuan as the only legal currency in March of this year for a unified monetary system. All other tin foil, ingots, paper silver dollars, etc., are no longer used. If you want to burn some money to your ancestors or relatives in the underworld, the only way is to burn some Gold Yuan to them. It should also be declared that because Bao Longtu is the Yama in the underworld, he is always ready to use the guillotine to kill people, so the speculation and hoarding trend has disappeared, and the value of the Gold Yuan is extremely high. Burning four or five thousand like this can already be of great use.</p>
<p>If this propaganda is effective and becomes popular among the old women who believe in Buddha and ghosts, and everyone does it, just imagine: the country can save a batch of useful materials - tin, and the currency will be issued and burned from time to time, and will never inflate because there is too much. How obvious the benefits are.</p>
<p>The Central Bank can also stop selling materials to tighten the money supply, because naturally, the money supply can be "burned" very tight.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Strange Customs <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Cang Yu</p>
<p>In a certain area of Peru, there is a peculiar custom that if a woman's skirt is torn, she is not allowed to take it off, but can only add a new one on top of it. Thus, for each torn skirt, a new one is added. Women from wealthy families often wear more than a dozen skirts. Furthermore, whenever these women meet a man, the men must take off their hats to show respect.</p>
<p>Among the Mosuo people, if a wife cannot give birth to a male child after marriage, she must obtain special permission from the clan chief to divorce her husband and marry another man. She can continue to divorce and remarry until she can give birth to a male child. Only then can she officially be called the permanent wife of her last husband.</p>
<p>Thai people often change the color of their pants and aprons according to the day of the week. Red on Sunday, yellow on Monday, pink on Tuesday, green on Wednesday, light gray on Thursday, feather gray on Friday, and purple on Saturday. They believe that the stars in the sky have seven colors, and the stars in the human world also have seven colors. Therefore, the sun and moon match the colors of the stars in the sky to seek more blessings. White is worn for funerals, just like in our country.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Writer <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Cang Yu</p>
<p>A writer is able to win our love and care because he reveals his soul to us. — Tolstoy</p>
<p>A writer should be as unfettered by worldly affairs as a clergyman. — Emerson There are two types of writers: one who writes for the sake of writing, and another who writes for the sake of a topic. — Balzac</p>
<p>The world often praises writers of previous generations, not because writers are admired after death, but because writers compete and fight fiercely when they are alive, and no one is willing to praise anyone. — Tagore</p>
<p>If a writer only thinks about the problems of life when writing, it is difficult for him to have lofty ideas. — Romain Rolland</p>
<p>A writer's pen is the throat of the soul. — Kingsley</p>
<p>My writing is not on the surface, but in the soul: only a lofty soul can have great thoughts. ... A great and respectable writer does not use words as a means to seek fame and fortune. Those who only seek to make money naturally have base thoughts. — Johnson</p>
<p>A great writer must write about the suffering of the times and create the light of the times. — Lu Xun</p>
<h3 id="e178">Paris Also Experiences Housing Shortages <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>It was once said that Shanghai was the Paris of the East. Judging from the housing shortages in both places, they are indeed quite similar.</p>
<p>In Paris, a worker pays only one U.S. dollar per month for rent. A house suitable for a family of six costs two dollars per month (equivalent to the price of eleven packs of the cheapest cigarettes). A medium-sized apartment with three or four large rooms costs one and a half to two and a half U.S. dollars per month. Even the houses inhabited by the wealthy cost only three and a half to ten U.S. dollars per month.</p>
<p>Low rent is certainly good news for tenants, but the housing shortage in Paris is becoming increasingly serious, with occupancy rates at capacity everywhere. Almost no new houses have been built in Paris in the past twelve years.</p>
<p>The only opportunity to find housing is to wait for a lonely old tenant to die, and then move in immediately. Renting an apartment requires a down payment of five hundred to fifteen hundred U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Paris has approximately eighty-four thousand various types of residences, of which over ninety percent were built before World War I. At least sixteen thousand of these are dilapidated and should be demolished and rebuilt. However, the remaining houses are not all up to standard either. Eighty-two percent of Paris houses do not have bathrooms, more than half do not have sanitary facilities, and even one-fifth of the houses do not have running water.</p>
<h3 id="e179">The Story of the Safety Razor <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Bin Zhi</p>
<p>There's a saying: "Frequent haircuts, infrequent baths." But most people feel the opposite: bathing is relaxing and enjoyable, while getting a haircut is often seen as a daunting task, and people try to postpone it for as long as possible. Longer hair isn't necessarily a problem, but a face full of stubble feels a bit unpresentable in public. While one may have a razor for shaving at home, the blade is sharp, and without the skilled hands of a barber, a careless move can lead to bloodshed. In this situation, the safety razor was eventually born.</p>
<p>The safety razor was invented in 1880 by three German brothers who immigrated to the United States. The form of the razor resembled a hoe, with a blade open on one side, called the "Star Razor." Within a few years of its appearance, it became popular and took away business from many barbershops. Soon, the "Gem" and "American" razors also emerged, creating a three-way rivalry.</p>
<p>At that time, although the safety razor was quite popular, it was not yet universal. Sales surged after the Gillette razor was introduced in 1903. Packets of blades, like packets of chewing gum, became household items. The creator of the Gillette razor was the person pictured on the wrapper, "Gillette." He was originally a salesman from Brooklyn with ambitions to invent. He spent his days searching for things needed in everyday life, noting them down on small pieces of paper and arranging them alphabetically. The fantasy of invention consumed him day and night.</p>
<p>One morning, Gillette was washing up, standing in front of the mirror, shaving his face. The razor had lost its sharp edge, and it hurt him to shave. Suddenly, he had an inspiration: he thought of making blades from thin steel sheets, sharp on both sides, and attaching them to a frame, which would be very convenient to use. So he immediately went to a hardware store to buy a steel strip used for making clock springs, and used pliers and other simple tools to make a sample blade. Everyone laughed at him, and many people in knife and scissor factories advised him to give up the idea.</p>
<p>But Gillette did not heed their advice. He believed that steel sheets could be made into blades, as long as the technology was improved. He continued to research while trying to raise capital. Six years later, he found twenty people who were willing to gamble, each contributing two hundred and fifty U.S. dollars. These two hundred and fifty U.S. dollar shares were worth sixty-two thousand five hundred U.S. dollars a few years later.</p>
<p>With this five thousand U.S. dollars in capital, Gillette bought machines and started manufacturing his new product in a room above a fish shop. By 1903, the blades were successfully produced, but the company was in debt, and the workers had not been paid for two weeks. At that time, Gillette found another boss who was willing to invest sixty thousand dollars but required full management control of the factory. Gillette reluctantly accepted. In 1903, fifty safety razors were sold at five dollars each. By the second year, sales had exceeded ninety thousand. In the third year, sales increased to more than two hundred and seventy thousand.</p>
<p>After the success of Gillette blades, sales increased year by year. In 1905, a London office was established. The following year, sales spread throughout Europe. In 1915, the "Old Man" brand blades were launched, using various methods to try to replace Gillette blades. Today, "Old Man" blades are also very popular, but Gillette blades have not been greatly affected.</p>
<p>The popularity of Gillette blades is partly due to his patent. Because Gillette obtained a seventeen-year patent after making double-edged blades, other manufacturers could only make single-edged blades. Without anyone competing with him, he was able to have smooth sailing. By 1921, the Gillette blade patent had expired, and other brands of double-edged blades emerged like a storm. At that time, many kinds of Japanese blades were shipped to Chicago. The Gillette company also knew this, and in that year, they made a new, more beautiful style, selling it at a lower price than before. In this way, the new brands could not gain a foothold, and Gillette made even more money.</p>
