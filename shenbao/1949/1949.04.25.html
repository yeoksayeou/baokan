<h3>何院長離滬前召開軍會　厚集兵力保衛上海　中央金融機構決不遷移</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕行政院長兼國防部長何應欽上將，廿三日抵滬後，當晚召集顧總長祝同，湯總司令恩伯，周總司令至柔，桂總司令永淸，陳警備司令大慶，及各將領舉行軍事會議，何院長就厚集國軍兵力，保衛大上海之各項部署指示至為詳盡。昨（廿四）日上午，何氏復邀約潘公展·徐寄　·顏惠慶·張嘉璬·谷正綱·錢新之·劉鴻生·楊虎·陸京士·水祥雲·徐學禹·程滄波·駱淸華諸氏商談，湯恩伯·陳良兩氏亦參加，何院長卽席宣布政府確保大上海之最大決心，與會諸人至為興奮，並熱烈發表意見，充分表現政府與人民團結一致保衛大上海之合作精神，何氏並宣布在滬之中央金融機關為配合軍事及適應工商業之需要，決繼續在滬執行業務，將遷移之說，絕對不確。又上海居民之生活必需品，如糧食及燃料等，由市政府及地方領袖人士共同負責，儘量採購供應，務使不虞匱乏，所有市民包括各級機關公務員及一切工商人等，均應安居樂業，人人固守自己崗位，為保衛大上海而努力，不得藉口遷移疏散要索所謂應變費，以致淆惑聽聞，擾亂秩序，因上海市民應以上海為安生活命之所，國軍旣有確保上海之決心與把握，而生活必需品之供應，又有周密之計劃與準備，凡屬市民，自應與政府及國軍協同一致，永遠確保自己之生命綫，決不容自亂步驟，為敵人造機會也。何氏事畢，業於廿四日午偕政院秘書長黃少谷等專機飛穗。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕共軍迅速渡江成功，使美國軍事專家相信中共軍倘欲佔據上海，亦可不經多大戰鬥達到目的。但一部份官員揣測共軍或繞過上海，因共軍佔據上海將阻止美國救濟米運往上海，在民食問題增加共方之重負。</p>
<h3>何院長飛抵廣州</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿四日電〕政院何院長乘中美「〇〇一」號專機，於廿四日下午四時卅分飛抵此間天河機塲，同來者有秘書長黃少谷及賀衷寒等十餘人，何氏下機後與歡迎者一一握手，並檢閱儀仗隊，記者請其發表談話，渠僅稱：余欲言者，已於昨交新聞處發布矣，隨卽匆匆登車離機塲。</p>
<h3>共軍進入南京城　水電恢復商店仍未開門</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿四日電〕共軍業於廿四日上午二時三十分進入南京，於拂曉時已有共軍一萬人佔領首都。陳毅部下約五十萬人以上，於晚際開始渡江。城內秩序已恢復，共軍巡視街道，制止再有紊亂及搶刧情事。維持委員會正與中共聯絡官員討論市政府及其他機構移交之詳細計劃。水電已恢復，郵電照常辦公，各學校仍繼續上課，商店仍未開啓，小菜塲已在營業。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京二十四日電〕中共業在二十四日恢復南京秩序。共軍二十萬人集中浦口，等待船舶渡江，「人民治安維持會」已接得共方通知，在以後三天內供應充分船隻。二十四日淸晨，大批民衆擁在街頭，靜觀共軍進城。共軍兩人卽在「人民治安維持會」所在地的南京飯店佈崗，共軍席地而坐，四圍擁有大批羣衆。記者注意正從中山東路轉往東門接收機塲的共軍一旅，他們的配備與國軍相彷，黃色的軍服上交無符號，若干人並戴有美國製的鋼盔，進城的共軍兩團，業在社會局及公路管理局駐紮，但其實際總部及司令姓氏則並未透露，共軍中大部份係江蘇人。</p>
<p>共軍第三十五軍及二十八軍正在渡江，現已進城的先頭部隊屬於第三十五軍，總統府及首都衛戍司令部前亦已佈崗，街頭則時有小隊共軍往來巡邏，「人民治安維持會」正與共軍聯絡官討論接收市政府及其他機構的詳細計劃。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿四日電〕共軍於今晨三時四十五分接收南京。軍隊係由西北門開入，由軍官乘吉普車一輛開路，士兵沿中山路向焚燒之司法院大廈開進。共軍進城後，韌帶佔據各要點，並接收各政府機關銀行與公用事業。共軍入城未遇抵抗，早起之市民均在街頭，用好奇眼光觀看共軍。共軍散佈城內後，卽分組排齊坐定，唱歌並聽官長訓話。</p>
<p>記者等所坐之吉普車最先與入城共軍相遇，當被共軍攔住，並以溫和態度問余等來歷，同業管君吿以代表法國新聞社，余亦答以美國聯合通訊社。某兵卽喊「美國人」，卽以電筒照余面，並凝視。此輩將吾等帶至一百碼遠共軍某軍官處，該軍官盤問吾等之職業，然後囑余等回去，吾等尾隨開路之吉普車，吾等之汽車落後時，該車時常等候，車夫極為知趣，余等向該車一瞥，見內有一人衣服較他人為齊整，大約為歡迎共軍入城之南京代表團領袖。</p>
<h3>馬靑苑其人</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿四日電〕在首都一家破敗的旅館黑暗房間裏，坐着一個疲倦的老翁，他在數小時內，必須把首都移交給勝利的共軍。這人便是六十歲的退休師長馬靑苑，現任南京臨時治安委員會主席。星期六黎明前，他被電話喚起，打電話來的是衛戍司令張耀明，張氏匆匆吿訴馬氏，在過渡時期暫維治安，並允許撥給馬氏足額警察和保安隊。但馬氏今晨對記者談話時，對於治安情形，極為失望。他說：「我們沒有足夠警察，我們沒有足夠的軍隊保護全市防止搶刦。」</p>

<p>〔合衆社南京廿四日電〕進入南京之共軍廿四日奉令逮捕一切戰犯，此令亦貼於街上。</p>

<h3>蘇州人心甚鎭靜　工商自衛隊已出動站崗　無錫共軍進城後學校照常上課</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿四日電〕此間廿四日人心甚鎭靜，惟行人三五成羣，竚立街頭，遇有軍隊或學生結隊而過，則竊竊私語，徒增疑慮氣氛。今日適逢星期，觀前街商店大部閉門或半開半掩，銀元販仍極活躍，民間以急需現款購存糧食，乃遭銀元販殺價，袁頭一落千丈，進出價僅為廿八萬·三十萬，米·油幾無處可購，升斗小民生活堪虞。工商自衛隊已出去站崗，精神飽滿，予惶惶民心以莫大安慰，謠言仍多，一夫走呼，亂者相從，誠庸人自擾。搶刦事件城內尚未發生，惟道前街一米店因拒絕顧客憑米票領米，致被搶一空。省府人員已於二十四日全部乘船赴松江，本邑朱縣長仍留守，縣府俟必要時撤退，交通工具業已備妥，一二三軍軍長顧錫九已抵蘇，廿四日午後在城防指揮部與厲指揮官及朱縣長交換意見。</p>

<h3>陳納德將作最後呼籲　軍事援華抗共軍　美國會調查對華政策大致確定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿三日電〕霍華系報紙廿三日稱，陳納德將軍正返美，「作美國援助國軍之最後呼籲，以抵抗共黨之南進。」霍華系報華盛頓電訊稱，前飛虎隊領袖「相信給與中國有效之援助尚不過晚。」證明渠信心之勇氣，渠願親自參戰，如能獲得所需之飛機。陳納德可望為呼籲援華方案而出席國會委員會。渠之觀點與前美軍顧問團團長巴大維少將相抵觸，巴大維作證時稱，國民黨軍之失敗，並非由於缺乏軍事配備。陳納德以為少數空軍卽可恢復國軍將領及士兵之士氣，而對共黨則有相等之沮喪效果。陳納德深信，中國之回教省區將為抵抗共黨侵略之中心。彼等領袖如寗夏之馬鴻逵，及靑海之馬步芳在中國軍事界極受重視。陳納德相信西部之山區，亦將作戰到底。渠稱「旣使共黨能沿粵漢路至南海岸，彼等仍將遭遇西部之堅決抵抗」。渠繼稱，日本於一九四一年佔領中國之地較共黨現在所佔者為多。當時很多人稱，局勢已無望，渠稱時間證明彼等錯誤。渠認為當時美援救了中國，現仍能再救。</p>

<h3>銀元問題的檢討</h3>
<p>在金圓劵惡性膨脹的今日，誰也不再信任不兌現的紙幣，因此隱居多年的銀元，重又被人重視。四月十九日本市第二次舉行的會報中，討論中心幾完全集中於銀元問題，如管理銀元買賣·銀元可否作為通貨·及物價可否以銀元作為標準等，銀元到了現階段中，這許多問題確也値得解決了。</p>
<p>本來銀元是有實値的貨幣，加之它在我國貨幣史上向來占着相當重要的地位，所以人民普遍地對它發生偏愛的心理，這也就是它今日能盛行的一大原因。但人民習用銀元，非自今日始，遠在法幣時代，銀元便已在內地自動的成為一種通貨，到了目前金圓券行將崩潰的前夕，當局如其想持續金圓券的生命，毋寗正式恢復銀元的使用，更為有意義得多。</p>
<p>本質上銀元雖已成為當前的主要通貨，「財金改革方案」中也已認定它可以自由的「流動」，但由於「商品不得以銀元標價」的措施，畢竟使它還沒有取得正式的貨幣身份；這使今日的銀元地位，更形奇特而微妙。其實從貨幣學的觀點而論，旣名「流通」，當然是流通的工具，也即是取得了貨幣的地位。況就已有的各種措施中，軍餉發銀元，中央銀行拋銀元，行莊領款搭銀元，省市機關收支用銀元，銀元旣然被廣泛的當着標準的單位，大鈔的替身，那有還不承認它為合法地位的理由？要知今天金圓劵時時在貶値，中央銀行已失去駕馭的能力，通貨到了這種惡性的程度，怎能避免要被人厭棄呢？</p>
<p>使用銀元，誠然對於金圓劵有一種排斥的作用，但從客觀上看，這並不能歸咎於銀元，而是通貨膨脹下必然的結果。如其還要存心為了保全金圓劵的使用，而禁止銀元使用的話，則無異因噎廢食了。還有現在一部份的政府機關，事實上都已用了銀元為收支的單位，劉財長也曾表示過現在國庫每月的支出，需要銀元一億二千萬枚。政府處處論銀元，難道專管限制人民用銀元為記帳單位與商品標價嗎？</p>
<p>關於管理銀元賣買問題，雖不是銀元問題的核心，但最易引起紛擾的局面。例如過去有人提起了銀牛的馬路交易，妨礙交通，因此市政當局便在馬路上大捕人犯，結果弄得社會秩序，大為不寗，固然，馬路交易不是合法的塲所，但這並不是小販們甘願出此，實在是為生活所迫。政府旣沒有輔導他們就業的機會，難道還要摔破他們最後僅賸的一隻飯碗？而且他們在進出之間，所賺的利潤很微，以目前大頭的買賣而論，不過只有一二萬元的上下，絕非錢兌店相差到五萬元以上的驚人鉅額。</p>
<p>此外，目前一般開心的銀元價格問題，也很重要。過去曾有人認為目前的銀元價格，是一種不合理的畸形現象，也是領導漲風的一項因素，所以必須全力加以壓低。這種說法，可以說是錯誤的。因為現階段中的物價漲風，是生產萎縮通貨膨脹下的必然現象，並不是任何商品可以領導的。再說人民的偏好，原是經濟上的一種自然趨勢，承平時代尚且不可拂逆，何况到了當前經濟危機日深的時期，怎可驟然改變過來？進一步說，銀元的購買力單位較小，所以買賣的對象，大都是薪水階級的人物，即使當前政府還有實力，也不應對準這些血汗換來的銀元儲蓄者們先開砲！</p>
<p>要之，我們以為政府如要穩定幣値，安定民生，不妨改行過渡的兩本位制。原則上金圓劵仍為主要的通貨之一，實際上銀元即成為收付的工具。只要運動得當，承認旣成事實，因勢利導，總可收到眞正的效果。雖然有人認為目前採用銀本位制，不免是開倒車，但是我們觀察事實，應分析一般的情勢，不可好高鶩遠。當前國內一般購買力的低弱已達極點，根本與使用實際金本位的時期，距離尚遠。</p>
<h3>對中國局勢最近發展　聯合國持靜觀態度　英美將重行檢討對華政策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿三日電〕此間今日據報，英國調查局已接獲蘇聯援助中共之文件副本。報吿人堅稱此項文件證明莫斯科政府顯然與中共合作，但未言其詳。聯合國機構中國代表團聆悉此報吿，頗感興趣，但未正式表示將取何種行動。聯合國一部份代表稱，此項文件如有充分證據，中國政府可在安理會中對蘇聯提出申訴。中國代表團今日曾舉行特別會議此項報吿，但其所取靜觀政策，並無改變之象。據聯合國方面稱，中國前擬在聯合國大會中提出中國局勢問題，指控蘇聯未完全遵守條約，此舉業已作罷。蘇聯對國民政府曾採取最準確之途徑。根據目前報吿，聯合國機構對中國內戰實無能為力。中國並未提出申訴，聯合國秘書長賴伊已於去冬明白表示不擬以調人資格干預，其他會員亦無提出中國局勢問題之表示。惟西方國家代表於私下談稱，長江砲轟英艦事件，無疑將使英美兩國重行檢討其全部對華政策。</p>
<h3>恢復談判解決德國問題　蘇向美再作試探　英與美法意見未能一致</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖廿三日電〕消息靈通方面證實稱，蘇聯駐聯合國代表馬立克與美代表傑塞普仍在成功湖進行會談。蘇外次葛羅米柯在會談開始後卽前往紐約，故並未正式參加。據謂，蘇方已建議解除柏林封鎖，主張繼之立卽召開佔領國外長會議，討論統一德國問題。</p>
<p>故今日之問題，已非蘇聯是否接受西方各國恢復四國會談之先決條件而為西方是否願在蘇聯實施此舉後與蘇會商德國地位問題。據謂蘇方對恢復談判，並未提出任何條件，且未要求西方各國暫緩成立西德共和國，以待召開四國會議。該方面又謂，美國方面準備接受蘇聯目下所提之建議恢復四國談判，且不斷以馬立克與傑塞普會談之經過通知英法兩國。法國之態度與美國相同，但英方則反對，認為西方各國應堅持目前之立塲，以待西德憲法之產生。蓋東德之團結目下較西德為強，故目下若卽進行談判，則日後東德可能霸佔西德云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社法蘭克福廿三日電〕德社會民主黨領袖許曼契，顯然主張早日結束柏林之封鎖，吿其黨徒稱，彼等必須不容許於現在成立西德政府。三日前在漢諾威之該黨秘密會議中，許曼契指示此項訓令。孰知該會進行程序之人廿三日將許氏之訓詞傳出。許曼契並吿該黨會議稱，社民黨所建議之短的憲法，可能非盟國或德國其他黨派所可接受。渠於會後聲稱，社民黨願意以彼等建議之西德憲法為基礎而談判。渠於廿三日稱，盟國外長廿二日之照會，答應「同情考慮」社民黨對德國支出有更緊密之中央控制的要求，乃為「吾人顯明立塲之初步有希望的結果」。</p>
<h3>德捷邊境美軍演習吿結束</h3>

<h3>約翰遜令美海軍　停造超級母艦</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿三日電〕美國防部長約翰遜今日令美海軍停止六萬五千噸航空母艦之建築工程。該艦龍骨甫於星期一在佛琴尼亞海軍船塢裝置。約翰遜致海長蘇利文之備忘錄有云，渠於審查聯合參謀部之意見及與杜魯門總統會晤後，已決定暫停該艦之建築工程。按海空軍方面對該超級航空母艦之建築頗有爭執，空軍認為海軍建造該可供B廿九型機昇降之母艦，為侵犯空軍所負之戰略轟炸任務。海軍設計該艦已耗去六百萬元。</p>
<h3>荷比慮接收德領土　街頭墻壁發現德人標語</h3>

<p>當開入埃爾登城時，居民鎭靜而觀，似無感動，僅有城內唯一懸掛荷蘭旗之房屋，有人伸出窗口，向荷軍歡呼。埃爾登市長洛克納在市中心恭候新市長勃洛波之抵達，街頭墻上出現德人所書標語，有「德意志·永遠是德意志的」等字樣，一最大的標語為「友誼則可，倂呑則否。」在西達城東數公里之一德人海關站內，當荷軍開到時，各物均已被移去，零亂不堪，在一室內甚至地板亦被撬去，板壁亦多不見。區內居民今晨工作如恒，似亳無感覺者。</p>

<h3>Director He Convenes Military Meeting Before Leaving Shanghai: Concentrate Forces to Defend Shanghai; Central Financial Institutions Determined Not to Relocate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] General He Yingqin, President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of National Defense, arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd. That evening, he convened a military meeting with Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou, Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, Garrison Commander Chen Daqing, and various generals. Director He gave detailed instructions on the deployment of concentrated national forces to defend Greater Shanghai. Yesterday morning (the 24th), He also invited Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiyu, Yan Huiqing, Zhang Jia'ao, Gu Zhenggang, Qian Xinzhi, Liu Hongsheng, Yang Hu, Lu Jingshi, Shui Xiangyun, Xu Xueyu, Cheng Cangbo, and Luo Qinghua to discuss matters. Tang Enbo and Chen Liang also participated. Director He announced the government's utmost determination to secure Greater Shanghai. All participants were greatly excited and enthusiastically expressed their views, fully demonstrating the spirit of unity and cooperation between the government and the people in defending Greater Shanghai. He also announced that the central financial institutions in Shanghai would continue to conduct business in Shanghai to support the military and meet the needs of industry and commerce, and that rumors of relocation were absolutely untrue. Furthermore, the municipal government and local leaders will be jointly responsible for ensuring the supply of essential goods for Shanghai residents, such as food and fuel, to prevent shortages. All citizens, including government employees at all levels and all industrial and commercial personnel, should live and work in peace, and everyone should remain steadfast in their positions, working to defend Greater Shanghai. No one should use relocation or evacuation as an excuse to demand so-called emergency funds, which would create confusion and disrupt order. Shanghai citizens should consider Shanghai as their home and the place to live their lives. Since the national army is determined and confident in securing Shanghai, and there are thorough plans and preparations for the supply of essential goods, all citizens should cooperate with the government and the national army to permanently secure their own lifeline and should not create disorder, giving the enemy an opportunity. After completing his business, He flew to Guangzhou by special plane on the afternoon of the 24th, accompanied by Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Huang Shao-gu and others.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] The rapid success of the Communist army in crossing the Yangtze River has led American military experts to believe that if the Chinese Communists wish to occupy Shanghai, they can achieve this without much fighting. However, some officials speculate that the Communist army may bypass Shanghai, as occupying Shanghai would prevent American relief grain from reaching Shanghai, increasing the Communist side's burden on the food supply.</p>
<h3>Director He Arrives in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] Director He of the Executive Yuan arrived at Tianhe Airport here at 4:30 PM on the 24th on the Sino-American "001" special plane. He was accompanied by Secretary-General Huang Shao-gu, He Zhonghan, and more than ten others. After disembarking, He shook hands with those who welcomed him and inspected the honor guard. When reporters asked him to make a statement, he only said: "What I want to say has already been released by the Information Office yesterday." He then hurriedly boarded a car and left the airport.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Enters Nanjing City: Water and Electricity Restored, Shops Still Not Open</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] The Communist army entered Nanjing at 2:30 AM on the 24th. By dawn, 10,000 Communist soldiers had occupied the capital. Over 500,000 troops under Chen Yi began crossing the river in the evening. Order has been restored in the city. Communist soldiers patrol the streets to prevent further disorder and looting. The Maintenance Committee is discussing detailed plans for the transfer of the municipal government and other institutions with Communist liaison officers. Water and electricity have been restored, and postal and telecommunications services are operating as usual. Schools continue to hold classes, but shops are still not open. Small vegetable markets are already open for business.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] The Chinese Communists restored order in Nanjing on the 24th. 200,000 Communist soldiers are concentrated in Pukou, waiting for ships to cross the river. The "People's Security Maintenance Association" has received notification from the Communist side to provide sufficient ships in the next three days. On the morning of the 24th, a large number of people crowded the streets, quietly watching the Communist army enter the city. Two Communist soldiers were stationed at the Nanjing Hotel, where the "People's Security Maintenance Association" is located. The Communist soldiers sat on the ground, surrounded by a large crowd. A reporter noticed a brigade of Communist soldiers turning from Zhongshan East Road towards the east gate to take over the airport. Their equipment was similar to that of the National Army. Their yellow uniforms were unmarked, and some wore American-made steel helmets. Two regiments of Communist soldiers who entered the city were stationed at the Social Affairs Bureau and the Highway Administration Bureau, but the names of their actual headquarters and commanders were not revealed. Most of the Communist soldiers are from Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The Communist 35th and 28th Armies are crossing the river. The vanguard troops that have entered the city belong to the 35th Army. The Presidential Palace and the Capital Garrison Headquarters have also been garrisoned. Small teams of Communist soldiers patrol the streets from time to time. The "People's Security Maintenance Association" is discussing detailed plans for the takeover of the municipal government and other institutions with Communist liaison officers.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] The Communist army took over Nanjing at 3:45 AM this morning. The troops entered through the Northwest Gate, led by an officer in a Jeep, with soldiers marching along Zhongshan Road towards the burning Supreme Court building. After entering the city, the Communist army occupied key points and took over government agencies, banks, and public utilities. The Communist army encountered no resistance upon entering the city. Early-rising citizens watched the Communist army with curiosity. After dispersing throughout the city, the Communist army sat down in groups, sang songs, and listened to lectures from officers.</p>
<p>The jeep in which the reporters were sitting was the first to encounter the Communist army entering the city. It was stopped by the Communist soldiers, who asked about their identities in a gentle manner. Mr. Guan of the same profession told them that he represented the French News Agency, and I also replied that I was from the American United Press. One soldier shouted "American" and shone a flashlight on my face, staring intently. They took us to an officer of the Communist army about one hundred yards away. The officer questioned us about our profession and then told us to go back. We followed the jeep that led the way. When our car fell behind, that car often waited. The driver was very sensible. We glanced at the car and saw that one person inside was more neatly dressed than the others, probably the leader of the Nanjing delegation welcoming the Communist army into the city.</p>
<h3>Who is Ma Qingyuan?</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] In a dark room of a dilapidated hotel in the capital sits a tired old man who must hand over the capital to the victorious Communist army in a few hours. This man is Ma Qingyuan, a 60-year-old retired division commander and current chairman of the Nanjing Temporary Security Committee. Before dawn on Saturday, he was awakened by a phone call from Garrison Commander Zhang Yaoming, who hastily told Ma to temporarily maintain security during the transition period and authorized him to allocate sufficient police and security forces. However, when Ma spoke to reporters this morning, he was extremely disappointed with the security situation. He said: "We don't have enough police, we don't have enough troops to protect the city from looting."</p>
<h3>Nanjing Central Daily News Renamed "Liberation Daily"</h3>

<h3>Chennault Will Make a Final Appeal: Military Aid to China to Resist the Communist Army; US Congress Investigation of China Policy Largely Determined</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 23rd] The Howard newspaper group reported on the 23rd that General Chennault is returning to the US "to make a final appeal for US aid to the National Army to resist the southward advance of the Communists." The Howard newspaper Washington dispatch stated that the former Flying Tigers leader "believes it is not too late to provide effective assistance to China." Demonstrating his courageous confidence, he is willing to participate in the war himself if he can obtain the necessary aircraft. Chennault is expected to appear before congressional committees to advocate for aid to China. His views conflict with those of Major General Barr, former head of the US Military Advisory Group, who testified that the failure of the Nationalist army was not due to a lack of military equipment. Chennault believes that a small air force can restore the morale of Nationalist generals and soldiers and have an equally depressing effect on the Communists. Chennault firmly believes that China's Muslim provinces will be the center of resistance to Communist aggression. Their leaders, such as Ma Hongkui of Ningxia and Ma Bufang of Qinghai, are highly regarded in the Chinese military. Chennault believes that the mountainous areas of the west will also fight to the end. He said, "Even if the Communists can reach the southern coast along the Canton-Hankou Railway, they will still encounter determined resistance in the west." He went on to say that Japan occupied more Chinese territory in 1941 than the Communists now occupy. At that time, many people said that the situation was hopeless, but he said that time proved them wrong. He believes that US aid saved China at that time and can save it again now.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Senator Bridges said on the 23rd that the Communist control of South China would make MacArthur's occupation of Japan "more difficult."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Review of the Silver Dollar Problem</h3>
<p>In today's hyperinflation of the gold yuan, no one trusts inconvertible paper money anymore, so silver dollars, which have been in seclusion for many years, are once again being valued. At the second conference held in this city on April 19, the focus of discussion was almost entirely on the silver dollar issue, such as the management of silver dollar trading, whether silver dollars can be used as currency, and whether prices can be based on silver dollars. At this stage, these many issues are indeed worth resolving.</p>
<p>Originally, the silver dollar was a currency with real value, and it has always occupied a rather important position in the monetary history of our country, so people generally have a preference for it, which is a major reason why it can be so popular today. However, the people's habit of using silver dollars did not start today. As early as the legal tender era, silver dollars had automatically become a kind of currency in the inland. At the current eve of the impending collapse of the gold yuan, if the authorities want to continue the life of the gold yuan, it would be more meaningful to officially restore the use of silver dollars.</p>
<p>In essence, silver dollars have become the main currency of the present, and the "Financial Reform Plan" has also recognized that it can "flow" freely, but due to the measure that "commodities must not be priced in silver dollars," it has not yet obtained the formal status of currency. This makes the status of silver dollars today even more peculiar and subtle. In fact, from the perspective of monetary science, since it is named "circulation," it is of course a tool of circulation, that is, it has acquired the status of currency. Moreover, among the various measures that have already been taken, military salaries are paid in silver dollars, the Central Bank throws silver dollars, banks receive money in silver dollars, and provincial and municipal agencies use silver dollars for income and expenditure. Since silver dollars are widely regarded as the standard unit and a substitute for large bills, there is no reason not to recognize its legal status. It should be known that today the gold yuan is constantly depreciating, and the Central Bank has lost the ability to control it. How can such a malignant degree of currency avoid being rejected?</p>
<p>Using silver dollars does have a repelling effect on gold yuan, but from an objective point of view, this cannot be attributed to silver dollars, but is an inevitable result of inflation. If we still want to preserve the use of gold yuan and prohibit the use of silver dollars, it would be like cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. Moreover, some government agencies now actually use silver dollars as the unit of income and expenditure. Finance Minister Liu has also stated that the treasury's monthly expenditure now requires 120 million silver dollars. The government everywhere discusses silver dollars, is it only responsible for restricting people from using silver dollars as the unit of account and commodity pricing?</p>
<p>The issue of managing silver dollar trading, although not the core of the silver dollar issue, is the most likely to cause disturbances. For example, in the past, people mentioned the street trading of silver dollars, which hindered traffic, so the municipal authorities arrested people on the road, resulting in great social unrest. Of course, street trading is not a legal place, but it is not that peddlers are willing to do this, but are really forced by life. The government has not provided them with opportunities to find employment. Does it still have to break their last remaining rice bowl? Moreover, the profits they earn in trading are very small. In terms of the current trading of silver dollars, it is only about ten to twenty thousand yuan, which is by no means the shocking amount of more than fifty thousand yuan that exchange shops differ.</p>
<p>In addition, the current general issue of silver dollar prices is also very important. In the past, some people believed that the current silver dollar price is an unreasonable and abnormal phenomenon and is also a factor leading the rising trend, so it must be suppressed with all efforts. This statement can be said to be wrong. Because the current price increase in the current stage is an inevitable phenomenon under production shrinkage and currency inflation, and it is not something that any commodity can lead. Furthermore, people's preferences are originally a natural trend in economics. It is impossible to go against it in times of peace, let alone in the current period of deepening economic crisis. How can it be changed abruptly? To go further, the purchasing power unit of silver dollars is small, so the targets of buying and selling are mostly salaried people. Even if the current government still has the strength, it should not fire the first shot at these savers who have earned their silver dollar savings with their blood and sweat!</p>
<p>In short, we believe that if the government wants to stabilize currency value and stabilize people's livelihoods, it may as well implement a transitional bimetallic system. In principle, the gold yuan is still one of the main currencies, but in practice, the silver dollar becomes the tool for payment. As long as it is handled properly, recognizing the established facts and guiding the situation accordingly, we can always receive real results. Although some people think that adopting the silver standard system now is inevitably a step backwards, but when we observe the facts, we should analyze the general situation and not aim too high. At present, the weakness of general purchasing power in the country has reached the extreme, and the distance from the period of using the actual gold standard is still far away.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Recent Developments in the Chinese Situation, the United Nations Maintains a Wait-and-See Attitude; Britain and the United States Will Re-examine Their China Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd] It is reported here today that the British Bureau of Investigation has received a copy of documents of Soviet aid to the Chinese Communists. The reporter insisted that the documents prove that the Moscow government is clearly cooperating with the Chinese Communists, but did not elaborate. The Chinese delegation to the United Nations agencies was interested in the report, but did not officially indicate what action it would take. Some representatives of the United Nations said that if the documents have sufficient evidence, the Chinese government can file a complaint against the Soviet Union in the Security Council. The Chinese delegation held a special meeting today to discuss this report, but there was no change in its wait-and-see policy. According to the United Nations, China had intended to raise the issue of the Chinese situation in the United Nations General Assembly, accusing the Soviet Union of not fully complying with the treaty, but this move has now been abandoned. The Soviet Union has taken the most accurate approach to the National Government. According to current reports, the United Nations agencies can do nothing about the Chinese civil war. China has not filed a complaint, and United Nations Secretary-General Lie had made it clear last winter that he did not intend to intervene as a mediator, and no other members have expressed their intention to raise the issue of the Chinese situation. However, Western representatives said privately that the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River will undoubtedly cause Britain and the United States to re-examine their entire China policy.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Makes Another Attempt to the United States to Resume Negotiations to Resolve the German Problem; Britain and the United States Fail to Reach Agreement with France</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 23rd] Well-informed sources confirmed that Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik and US representative Jessup are still holding talks in Lake Success. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko went to New York after the start of the talks, so he did not formally participate. It is said that the Soviet side has suggested lifting the Berlin blockade and advocating that a meeting of foreign ministers of the occupying countries be convened immediately to discuss the issue of German unification.</p>
<p>Therefore, the question today is no longer whether the Soviet Union accepts the preconditions of the Western countries for the resumption of the Four-Power talks, but whether the West is willing to consult with the Soviet Union on the issue of Germany's status after the Soviet Union implements this measure. It is said that the Soviet side did not put forward any conditions for the resumption of negotiations, and did not ask the Western countries to suspend the establishment of the West German Republic pending the convening of the Four-Power Conference. It is also said that the US is preparing to accept the current Soviet proposal to resume the Four-Power talks, and is constantly notifying Britain and France of the progress of the Malik-Jessup talks. France's attitude is the same as that of the United States, but Britain opposes it, believing that the Western countries should insist on their current position pending the creation of the West German Constitution. Because the unity of East Germany is currently stronger than that of West Germany, if negotiations are held now, East Germany may dominate West Germany in the future.</p>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, 23rd] German Social Democratic Party leader Schumacher apparently advocated an early end to the Berlin blockade, telling his party members that they must not allow the West German government to be established now. Three days ago, at a secret meeting of the party in Hanover, Schumacher issued this instruction. It is not known that the person in charge of the proceedings of the meeting on the 23rd spread Schumacher's teachings. Schumacher also told the party meeting that the short constitution proposed by the Social Democrats may not be acceptable to the Allies or other German parties. He claimed after the meeting that the Social Democratic Party was willing to negotiate on the basis of their proposed West German constitution. He said on the 23rd that the note from the Allied foreign ministers on the 22nd, promising to "sympathetically consider" the Social Democratic Party's demand for closer central control over German expenditures, was "the first hopeful result of our clear stance."</p>
<h3>US Military Exercise on the German-Czech Border Ends</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 23rd] The US military ended its spring exercise today after being relentlessly attacked by a fictitious enemy force for five days, counterattacking across the Lauter Canal and driving the "invaders" back to Czechoslovakia.

<h3>Johnson Orders US Navy to Stop Building Super Aircraft Carrier</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] US Secretary of Defense Johnson today ordered the US Navy to stop construction of a 65,000-ton aircraft carrier. The keel of the ship was just laid on Monday at the Virginia naval shipyard. Johnson's memorandum to Navy Secretary Sullivan stated that after reviewing the opinions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and meeting with President Truman, he had decided to suspend the construction of the ship. According to the Air Force and Navy, there has been considerable controversy over the construction of the super aircraft carrier, and the Air Force believes that the Navy's construction of the carrier, which can be used for the take-off and landing of B-29 aircraft, infringes on the strategic bombing mission of the Air Force. The Navy has spent six million dollars designing the ship.</p>
<h3>Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg Receive German Territory; German Slogans Found on Street Walls</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Netherlands-German Border, 23rd] The troops of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg entered the new territory recently transferred from West Germany to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on time last night and today. No incidents have occurred so far tonight. When the troops entered, they were led by border police on motorcycles, followed by trucks full of soldiers, with police protection on the west side, followed by vehicles for military supplies.</p>
<p>When entering the city of Erden, the residents watched calmly, seemingly unmoved. Only someone in the only house in the city flying the Dutch flag leaned out of the window and cheered the Dutch army. Erden Mayor Lockner waited for the arrival of the new Mayor Bloppo in the city center. German-written slogans appeared on the walls of the streets, such as "Germany, always Germany," and the largest slogan was "Friendship, yes; annexation, no." At a German customs station a few kilometers east of the city of Sida, when the Dutch army arrived, all the objects had been removed, leaving a mess. In one room, even the floor had been pried up, and many of the wall panels were missing. Residents in the area went to work as usual this morning, seemingly unaware.</p>

<h3>New Method for Public Utility Charges to Be Implemented Today; Price Index for Today is 140,000 Times</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Due to the impact of the straight-line rise in commodity prices, the city's public utilities are on the verge of stagnation. The various companies have repeatedly submitted reports to the municipal government requesting a quick solution. After drafting a new method of pricing and charging, it was sent to the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council for approval for trial implementation a few days ago. In the future, users will pay fees, except for those who prepay, they should pay according to the public utility pricing index announced by the municipal government on the day, multiplied by the base number originally approved on March 1. Water, electricity, gas, and telephone will be calculated from today's (25th) meter reading (today's index is 140,000 times). Bills issued before today's meter reading that have not exceeded the payment deadline will still be charged at the original price listed on the bill, and if overdue, they will be handled according to the new method. The Public Utilities Bureau also stipulates that users can bring their last bill and prepay one month's worth of fees for the convenience of citizens. The company will settle the account according to the index on the date of collection and collect the fees in several units, which will not be affected by future price increases. It has also ordered the companies to collect fees at the index of 140,000 times today and tomorrow, but only direct payments to the company's collection points are allowed. (Collection banks and other places do not accept payments)</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Employees' Salaries to Be Issued by the Finance Bureau Today</h3>

The loan and allocation procedures have been completed. However, when the reporter visited Qian Jianfu, the acting director of the Finance Bureau, yesterday, he appeared restless and anxious. It is said that he is worried about the situation today, because although the money has been borrowed, the cash still needs to be collected from the Central Bank today. Acting Director Qian is extremely anxious because all the poor civil servants are eagerly waiting for the money to get through this chaotic time, so the responsibility is so great. He also said that this money was obtained through countless hardships and loans, and it is truly a banknote with every drop of blood. He hopes that it can be properly delivered to the hands of all employees today so that they can barely maintain the minimum living standard for a short time.</p>

<h3>Wartime Scenery: Families Moving from Suburbs, Long-Distance Buses Suspended</h3>
<p>Suzhou Creek Looks Brand New, Theaters and Dance Halls Alone Thrive</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] As the overall situation takes a sharp turn, Shanghai has generally been covered by a wartime atmosphere since yesterday. Stations, docks, and airports are crowded with people and piled with luggage. Residents in areas such as Xujiahui, Jiangwan, Hongkou, Pudong, and Nanshi are mostly moving to the central district with boxes and luggage. Residents in the central district are rushing to buy firewood, rice, and food supplies. Rickshaws can be seen lined up end to end on the roads.</p>
<p>With the exception of trains, all external transportation in the city has been suspended since yesterday. Long-distance buses to Shangsong, Qinghu, and Minzhe have stopped running. After the Garrison Department announced restrictions on the entry of passengers, inspections at various highway entrances are extremely strict, making it quite difficult for passengers from counties near Shanghai to come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to people coming from Songjiang and Qingpu: Starting yesterday, local authorities in these counties are also carrying out emergency evacuations, causing chaos. Robberies have even been seen in the countryside, but this information cannot be verified.</p>
<p>Because many silver dollars are brought by passengers passing through Shanghai, and they are eager to sell them, coupled with the fact that promissory notes are rejected by various stores and there is an insufficient supply of cash, and residents are selling their belongings to buy supplies in response to the situation, the price of Yuan Datou silver dollars has plummeted, with the closing price in the evening only between 350,000 and 370,000.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a weekly holiday, and the business of cinemas was still booming. The average occupancy rate in dance halls was also more than 60%. In parks, couples were often seen side by side, chatting intimately.</p>
<p>The boats that have always gathered in Suzhou Creek were ordered by the military and police authorities to be moved to the Huangpu River, and they were all cleared by noon, giving Suzhou Creek a brand-new look.</p>
<p>Vegetable prices have continued to lead the way in the past two days. Coal briquettes, charcoal, soybean oil, canned food, and salted goods have become the target of mass purchases, and prices are changing several times a day. Luxury goods and heavier items are not being asked about, and there are few customers in department stores.</p>
<p>Rice prices were extremely chaotic yesterday, with different prices being quoted in different districts, mostly around 89 Yuan Datou per shi.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Nanjing Train Connects to Suzhou, Order at North Station Is Quite Chaotic, It Is Reported that Zhenjiang-Nanjing Passenger Trains Have Resumed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the abandonment of Wuxi, the Shanghai-Nanjing railway has temporarily been connected to Suzhou, but there have been no trains going there since the afternoon. No more than one in ten passengers on the trains coming from the east are ordinary passengers, and most are soldiers and their families. The last train departed from Wangting and arrived in Shanghai at around 2 PM. The dedicated telephone line of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau has been cut off since yesterday. It is widely rumored at the North Station that the staff of the railway bureau remaining between Nanjing and Zhenjiang have resumed passenger train service starting yesterday. Shanghai-Hangzhou passenger trains are operating as usual, and passenger space is crowded. As soon as the railway bureau encounters spare vehicles, it immediately organizes trains to add extra services to evacuate excess passengers. The order at the North Station gradually became chaotic starting at noon yesterday. Boxes, luggage, and packages of all sizes piled up in the North Station hall and on various platforms. Soldiers and their families cooked and ate on the spot, creating a colorful spectacle. Rickshaws were not managed, and they entered the hall or ticket gates. Shanghai-Hangzhou trains were also unable to depart on time due to the impact of military vehicles. However, the railway bureau staff continued to adhere to their positions and work hard. The bureau is currently raising funds to purchase rice for distribution to employees in response to the situation.</p>
<h3>Emergency Measures for Ship Control: Release Permits Required for Export</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters will implement emergency measures for ship control starting immediately. All public and private ships in the jurisdiction must report when exporting, and a release permit must be issued by the headquarters before customs clearance and inspection and loading of passengers and goods can be carried out. All ships that have not obtained a release permit are strictly prohibited from leaving the port. Seagoing vessels exporting to the northern seas will be uniformly approved by the garrison department and escorted by troops. Navigation within the Yangtze River is strictly prohibited. Any ship that disobeys inspection and enters or leaves the port without authorization will be sunk.</p>
<h3>Gold Transactions in the City Mostly Settled in Silver Dollars, US Dollar Exchange Rate Plummets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was a Sunday holiday, and coupled with the chaotic wartime atmosphere on the streets, there were few transactions in general small gold jewelry stores. Promissory note transactions were even rarer. Gold transactions were mostly settled in silver dollars, and gold yuan transactions disappeared. The transaction price of gold was 41 Yuan Datou for sale and 38 Yuan Datou for purchase per tael. There were many customers seeking to exchange gold for silver dollars. The exchange rate of US dollars in the hands of scalpers plummeted even further, with a minimum price of 6 Yuan Datou for 10 US dollars.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Maintains Public Order, Patrols Day and Night in Shifts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mao, the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to cope with the extraordinary period, defend Shanghai, maintain local security, and ensure the lives and property of citizens, still worked as usual yesterday despite the Sunday holiday. He also instructed the directors of the first and second divisions of each sub-bureau not to take leave or abandon their posts. At the same time, armed police, a large number of plainclothes police, and all volunteer police were dispatched to patrol in shifts day and night, and those with suspicious appearances were strictly investigated in order to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble.</p>
<h3>Residents Robbed in the Middle of the Night</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Qin Xu Zhaodi, a 29-year-old widow from Funing residing at No. 58 Xinlu, Qiujiang Road, was sound asleep with her elderly mother at around 2 AM yesterday morning when two people wearing uniforms and carrying guns broke in and robbed them of eight silver dollars, a gray herringbone wool women's coat, a navy blue wool men's coat, a men's work uniform, and an old short coat each, and fled with the stolen goods.</p>
