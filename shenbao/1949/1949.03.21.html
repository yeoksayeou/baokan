<h3>新閣今日可能組成　施政方針着手草擬　根據四大目標切實推行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕新閣名單經代總統參與勸駕後，廿日已有顯著之進步，惟尙未獲最後決定，廿一日將續與各方商洽，有於廿一日組成之可能性。何氏廿日上午曾在其官邸邀張治中，吳忠信，翁文瀕等集會討論，並竟日與上海方面通長途電話，聽候回音。茲悉：全部閣員名單中尙成問題者，爲交通·財政·司法三部，交通已決定就沈怡及凌鴻勛兩氏中選一人，財政則仍請徐堪出任，司怯則暫無適當人選。其已決定者，則爲內長李漢魂，外長傳秉常，經長孫越崎，國防何兼，敎育杭立武，蒙藏白雲梯，僑務戴愧生，但其中外長一席係原來之決定，迄以外長人選與國策有關，尙未與傳接洽。政委名額七人，決留一二名以待民·靑兩黨，其餘五人已決定張翠·張治中，朱家驊·關吉玉四人，另一人在考慮中。據接近何應欽之權威人士廿日稱：何氏組閣之人選，苜先避免任用私人，同時避免干預，予何氏以全權；强調和平，减輕黨性，俾對中共無所刺激。何氏新閣原來超然，而新人，新政之理想，即在於此，目前所邀人士雖逐漸變化，但此兩項原則仍未變更。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕新閣名單尙在愼選之中，而新閣施政方針，業已由何氏着負責人進行草擬，其要點係根據：「謀取和平，政治革新，穩定經濟，安定民生，」四大目標以發揮，並力避繁雜冗文，務期簡要切實，便於推行。此項方針，可望於兩日內草就，交由何氏，於閣員名單公布，新閣宣吿組成後，即提向立院報吿。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕新閣成立後立待展開之工作，根據何氏接近之人士所談，約有以次數點：（一）公敎待遇之調整。（二）孫閣留穗人員之處理。（三）當前財政經濟整頓。又新閣宣吿成立後，各部會之重要人員，均將恢復原來各部曾辦公之形式，政院則移址於勵志社內辦公現在布置中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕民社黨蔣勻田，定廿日夜車去滬，將與該黨人士會商入閣寨宜。蔣氏十九日訪何應欽後，廿日晨並藹李代總統。蔣氏吿記者，民社黨入閣之熊度，在欲先暸解新閣之政策，俾能共同撐持危局。今何氏政策爲求合情合理之和平，但達成之方式，尙未知悉，故入閣與否，尙待該黨討論後決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕李代總統廿日晨十時半，親赴傅厚岡卅號，訪徐堪有所商談。下午四時半，李漢魂往訪徐氏，晚八時半，何應欽亦以電話約徐氏商談。</p>
<h3>郵電鐵路　暫緩加價</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿日電〕廿一日原爲郵電鐵路加價之期，茲據交次凌鴻勛表示，在立院對公營事業加價案未獲決議時將暫緩施行。</p>
<h3>立監委首次聯席座談　決加強兩院聯繫以後每月舉行一次　謀工作配合促助爭取和平改革政治</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕在京集會之立·監委聯席座談會，改於廿日開始舉行，以後並確定每月舉行一次，交換對時局之意見，並謀工作配合以促助政府肅淸貪汚無能，改革政治。廿日之座談會係第一次，出席立·監委約三百人，于右任·童冠賢均參加，公推李夢彪主席，自上午九時半至十二時發言委員共達廿人，其意見約分兩點，一爲爭取和平，改革政治，多指摘當前不合理現象·一爲謀加强兩院之聯繫，發揮力量。監委並特別提出監察法，對行使監察權之束縛，要求立院支持監院所提之修正意見，各委員發言咸甚激昂。關於前者，立委孔庚呼籲團結先自本身做起，和平須有生命及自由之保障，立委許蟠雲認爲，國是如此，由於憲法未實行，一黨之中政會，中常會可作最後決定，實可懷疑，故主張結束黨治，許並論及決策者不能執行，是否有其他力量阻止，應予研究，辭職是否休息，副總統代理總統時限，渠主張應考慮「正位定名」。立委牛踐初主張打倒特權階級，和平不能滲入投機意圖，渠贊成全面和平，反對局部和平，贊成公平的和平，反對投降的和平。立委王秉鈞指摘孫科內閣利用國家交通工具，將金銀財寶子女馬桶一齊搬到香港，太不像話。監委倪弼說明過去人民恨共黨，故贊成戡亂，現在因國軍（如在蘇北）要東西，也要女人，民不用命，故希望和平，槍桿階級認爲還可作戰，其思想荒謬絕倫，目前欲求和平，非承認失敗不可。李代總統及孫院長都已承認失敗，失敗原因爲紀綱敗壞，人心解體，如不整飭紀網，不僅不能作戰，亦不能和平。立委潘廉方以為，應打倒豪門，由立監委代表人民投票，確定誰為豪門，再調查其財產來源，不正當者由國家徽用，以制止通貨膨脹及物價上漲。立委苗春霖認爲，兩院權力不能行使，由於有一種其有廿年以上歷史的力量爲阻碍，渠主張以兩院爲中心，團結一切改革力量，督責政院實施改革。監委曹德宣認爲，監委對不起人民，立委也對不起人民，因翁閣，孫閣都是經立院同意的，故盼立院以後行使同意權，必須愼重。曹認爲國民黨應剷除腐化，共產黨　剷除惡化，過去政府戡亂，各地擁　，現在政府求和平，各地也擁護，乃趨炎附勢，若干地方反對徵兵徵糧，但共黨參軍要糧誰去反對，有人反對美援，但共黨接受蘇聯援助，何以不反對，吾人在此地有聯席座談自由，若到共區，連放屁也被干涉了。立委苗啓平認爲，吾」人應贖罪救亡，和平須有力量，否則只好對共黨磕頭，那卽是投降。關於後者，監　　委李正樂謂，懲戒案送出三個月乃至三年，仍無下文，故監察法必須修正。立委李世軍謂，監院可以彈劾肅淸貪汚，立院可以制度肅淸無能，兩院應有經常聯繫組織，可由兩院各推代表若干人組織之。立委吳望伋，劉振東均反對此種組織，認爲於法無據，且委員人數衆多，少數不能代表多數委員，吳望伋認爲，兩院每月可舉行聯合座談會一次，交換對時局意見，對雙方進行之案件，互相支持，亦可在進修娛樂各方面取得聯繫。監委曹德宣則主張，兩院各推負責入，對各種問題組織檢討會，交換意見。監委唐鴻烈贊成每月一次座談，主張由立院推六人，監院推五人負責籌備，唐并認為監院打老虎·打蒼蠅工作，被監察法這鐵絲網所阻礙，希望立委協助除去。最後立委孔庚提出書面建議，規定每月座談一次，主席徵得會衆同意，由立委六人，監委五人負責籌備，時已近午，李夢彪即席作結論謂，聞諸位高論，深覺今日集會有重大意義，本人之頹唐，因即爲之一振，不敢再以衰老自居。各位所言者，均爲代表人民，足證國家有望，深感慶幸，立監兩院爲左右臂，必須有密切配合，今後兩院應切實聯繫，推進工作，發揮力量，謹祝中華民國千秋萬歲，兩院同仁健康，至十二時散會。</p>
<h3>重慶號在葫蘆島港內被炸起火</h3>
<p>三月十八·十九兩日，空軍連續飛往葫蘆島轟炸重慶。號叛艦〔白箭頭指處〕，圖為該艦起火焚燒情形。</p>
<h3>重慶艦農煙衝天　葫蘆島碼頭大部被遮蔽　監委來滬調查叛變原因</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島廿日電〕重慶號巡洋艦十九日被B24炸中三彈後，艦尾油庫起火燃燒。十九日下午五時，B38型機前往胡蘆島上空拍照時，此項燃燒濃烟，隨風飄揚，遮蓋葫蘆島碼頭大部（見上圖）。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕十八十九兩日，空軍轟炸重慶號叛艦時，艦上抵抗之高射機槍，四十釐口徑者八挺，二十釐口徑者八挺，高射砲八門，葫蘆島碼頭上共軍高射砲五門，協助叛艦頑抗。當日風速甚大，B24型機當時分批追入電慶號上空，一面抵抗風速所造成之不易描準困難，一面要防備馬達八，〇〇〇呎的高射砲彈爆炸侵害，終於達成炸燬該艦之任務。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島廿日電〕重慶號巡洋艦蓄油量一千一百公噸，其航行中每小時耗油量五公噸，裝足重油可以續航四千海里，在海上航行九天七小時。第一次歐戰德國巡洋艦狼號在大西洋中製擊英美運輸輸艦，橫行數年之久，傷害美援助物資無算；重慶號叛艦倘無對空軍之顧慮，其在中共港口此後之任務，必然走向德艦狼號之舊路，以阻撓美援及滬台海航之連系。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿日電〕監委兩名，昨夜赴滬，調查「重慶」號叛變案證件。調查結果，或將作爲彈劾海軍總司令桂永淸之根據。</p>
<p>（「重慶號史實」見第二版，「訪留滬之重慶號副艦長及官兵卷屬」見第四版。）</p>
<h3>重慶號叛變及被炸殷鑒　軍事應痛自革新　打倒喝血提高官兵待遇</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕重慶號被炸沉後，軍界人士數名，曾就軍界諸待革新事端，發表意見。重慶號叛艦被空軍炸中後，此一艦體雖因艦中油庫焚燒，彈藥庫爆炸，而吿毀減，但致叛之因素，目前在軍界仍屬低迷籠罩，有待革新。廿年國軍，一面建軍，一面即有若干腐朽軍隊現象，被喝血者帶入軍中，其最顯著者，爲若干軍頭藉掌軍柄而攫取多資，後再以多資奢逸其身體，糊塗其腦筋，致軍政弛廢，賞罰不明。加以與共軍作戰後，戰略戰術，在在落伍，既無强固之軍體，又欠有效之運用。益以上層驕奢，中下層溫飽而不可得，在共軍之攻勢中，自然成直綫低落失敗，而無對抗支撐之能力。此一形勢，目前雖有若干革新，但據悉仍有若干不良現象存在。第一，目下國庫按編制中人數發餉，而實際上領餉國軍人數，却不及此數之半，鄭洞國·廖耀湘·王耀武等軍頭之軍敗被俘，似不足爲今日若干與其等位而居第一綫軍頭之殷鑒。彼等中若干人，雖能刻苦自勵，孤忠負責，但若干人在現實經濟體制驅策下，及其不良配偶需索下，仍然深居後方城邑，追求財物，日夜有虧職守，而不自愧。每一美國高級軍方人士，如馬歇爾·魏德邁·巴大維，雖一再友善直率批評中國軍界此一現象，但迄今軍界不自行改革，而必需等待共軍軍事攻勢之來，拉倒全軍。目下由於祗剩江南半壁江山，軍界自行革新整頓，似已到達最後機會，倘此時機一過，而不能改革，以自保保國，則日後共軍攻破江防，渡江南下，又將造成共軍攻無不克之現象，而實則為國軍自腐之所致。據此數軍界人士表示，革新之道很簡單，由軍方自行檢討，決定實施以健全軍體，及有效運用爲目標。此數軍方人士又稱：重慶號事件說明現代部隊之構成，裝備上具有極鉅大之經濟價値，倘若使用此項裝備之人員，其待遇供應，不能維繫其身心，且又以世紀末絕望圖置其眼前，則此項極具高價之裝備維護使用，均將發生問題。重慶號之出走毀減，超過一千萬英鎊，該艦之時値多多，但倘若該艦出走因素，有「待遇問題」在內，則此次損失之艦値一千萬英鎊，足可供應中國海軍全軍一年優厚生活之需。海軍自不能售艦以求改善生活，但亦應尊重有優良裝備，必需有優良人員，以配合之西方軍界原則，否則接受西方援助後，難保不造成類此之東方事變。</p>
<h3>龍雲否認流言</h3>
<p>函滇當局查拿嚴辦</p>
<p>〔本報昆明廿日電〕滇局不安之際，外間對前滇省主席龍雲頗多流言，且間有失意政客閒散軍官假藉名義，爲患鄕里，龍氏在港得悉後，極表憤怒，除鄭重否認外，並函滇當局查拿嚴辦，以維桑梓。</p>
<h3>豫鄂五六綏區完成聯防　土共襲應城未逞　江北共軍尚在部署階段</h3>
<p>〔本報信陽廿日電〕軍息：豫南五綏區與鄂東北六綏區聯防工作，已按預定計劃宣告完成。按六綏區現轄鄂北鄂東孝感·應城·禮山麻城等廿縣，為實行華中土地政策著有成效之實騐區，司令官為前張淦兵團副指揮官張光瑋中將。</p>
<p>〔本報信陽廿百電〕軍方證實共軍江漢軍區張體學部七千餘人，曾於十七十八兩日連續攻擊鄂北之應城（距漢口九十公里），一度迫近距離該城九華里之東北郊區，旋經增援該城之國軍張淦兵團某部擊退，今孝感與長江埠及應城間交通車仍照常行駛。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿日電〕鄂中鄂西土共連日有伺機移動模樣，國軍持鎭靜，迄今尙無大接觸。又當局爲加强江防，所有宜昌以下武穴以上各埠口均調遣海軍增防。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕連日江北國軍各橋頭堡如儀徽，口岸，施家橋，八　港及裕溪口等地，雖頻遭共軍之連貫攻擾，然其性質迄尚停滯於偵察試探及擾亂性階段，而尚未正式展開真面目攻勢。據某高級軍事負責人語記者：集結江北陳毅部共已增至十八個軍，其主力分駐淮南鐵路沿綫及運河區，津浦南段則較單薄。共軍之不斷擾亂攻擊，顯在所以掩護并便利其大軍作完整而週密的攻擊部署。惟據該負責人估計，近日內或不致對各橋頭堡即採大規模行動，然此絕非謂共軍不擬攻取各橋頭堡以爲渡江前奏之謂。至於渡江在目下言，尙屬過早，其理由一方固由於渡江準備尙未完成，一方亦由於在橋頭陣地未佔領前無從遂行大規模渡江。又，南下徐州之林彪部五個軍，此間判斷以調往豫南之成份爲多，一度緊張之江南人心，因復暫趨沉靜。</p>
<h3>關中形勢穩定　國軍收復大荔</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕軍息：關中國軍收復西起枸邑經銅川東至背城之綫後，形勢已趨穩定。</p>
<p>〔中央社西安十九日電〕西安綏署十九日下午六時發表戰報：國軍北進部隊，本日下午四時，攻克大荔縣城。</p>
<h3>張發奎余漢謀　應召由穗抵京　下機後即謁李氏總統何院長　余否認閩粵邊叛亂說</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕陸軍總司令張發奎，廣州綏署主任余漢謀，應李代總統電召，廿日下午三時自穗飛抵京，李代總統及何院長等均派代表歡迎。張·余二氏下機後，即於三時半晋謁李代總統，四時許晋謁何院長，長談一小時許，五時半許始返首都飯店寓所，與先後往訪之徐永昌·顧祝同·蔣鼎文·郭懺·張鎭·劉士毅及原寓首都飯店之陳誠，朱紹良等會談，一時各高級將領雲集，談話至七時許始散。晚顧祝同在私邸設宴，歡迎張·余兩氏，陳誠·朱紹良·徐永昌·蔣鼎文·桂永淸·郭懺·林蔚等均應邀參加。余氏廿日晚在旅邸語記者，此來係應李代總統之召，報吿廣東情形，擬留二三日即返穗。余氏並否認外傳閩·粵邊境發生叛亂情事，據云：汕頭安定，廣東第五淸剿區司令莫希德亦未被扣。</p>

<h3>社論　真和平的認識與把握</h3>
<p>—對何院長希望之五—</p>
<p>何院長自稱他的內閣，其主要任務是革新政治與謀取和平，故內閣組成而後，應該是一個「和平內閣」。可是在他的和平內閣組成的前夕，恰巧與和平相反的空氣接二連三的傳來，不但中國方面共軍渡江之戰好像要一觸即發，連整個世界，在大西洋公約公佈聲中，也似乎嗅得着火藥氣了。何內閣在這樣戰爭的氣壓之下，如何達成謀取和平的任務，實在是一件極其艱難的工作。</p>
<p>我們以為今天要謀和，一定先須辨清楚和平的真假，然後從盡其全力以求取真正的和平，庶幾不致墮入虛假和平的陷阱之中，而使整個國家和民族不能自拔。</p>
<p>這和平真假的辨別，在中共區域內，早在中共主席毛澤東氏的指示下，普徧展開熱烈的討論了；不但如此，恐怕在政府轄區內的中共黨員與其外團份子，也在響應着討論了。在他們，當然認為蔣總統，李代總統，何院長，乃至張治中邵力子諸氏所倡導所努力的和平，都是「美國帝國主義所導演的假和平」，唯有遵循「毛主席的八條」敬謹奉行者纔是真和平。但我們到今天還沒有看見或聽見國民黨人或一般無黨無派的人民注意到和平真假的分別。舉個實例來說，中共以為起碼要依照「北平型」的和平纔勉強算得真和平。彷彿報上看見過一條電報，邵力子氏在北平時曾說南方人士願意有「北平型」的和平。此外，似乎還沒有聽到其他的答覆。我們不知道邵氏是否真有此語，設果不誤，我們又不知道邵氏究何所根據而云然。我們願站在人民立場，提出這個問題的討論。</p>
<p>本報從十三日起到昨天止，連續刋載江雪君「北平型」的報道，大概當可使讀者得到「北平型」的平平輪廓了吧。一言以蔽之，北平城墻上大書特書的「傅作義率部投誠」的大標語，就是「北平型」和平的寫真！實在傅作義豈但「率部？」簡直是率了北平的人民去「投誠」了！投誠的軍民，還有什麼資格來講平等與自由？所以，外國的通訊社電報，要到現在纔來說中共撕毀了北平停戰協定亦即和平協定十三條的全部條文，總算不是「色盲」到底。我們早就指出：人民所要求的是和平而不是投降；政府所應該為人民求取的也是和平而不是投降。「北平型」的和平，中共已老實把它說穿了是「投降」，難道邵力子氏就想站在政府代表的地位，強自代表人民說南方人士都願完全向中共無條件的投降嗎？我們願警告何內閣：組「和平內閣」則可，做「投降內閣」則不可！</p>
<p>真和平纔是和平；假和平就是投降！然則和平與投降的分別在那裏呢？</p>
<p>我們要認識真和平的面目，大概至少要具備左列五點：</p>
<p>（一）國家獨立。我們要和平，為的是要建國。中華民國是四萬萬同胞所共有的，我們不能為了要和平而讓我們的國家來作強權國家的附庸。我們如果在和平幻夢中，不惜低首下心，關在鐵幕內去做附庸，那麼當年汪精衛之流背叛國家去和侵略的日本軍閥講和平，我們也可拍手贊成，不必抗戰到底了。故談判和平的條件中，如有絲毫妨害國家獨立主權的地方，那就不是真和平。</p>
<p>（二）領土完整。中華民國的領土是否完整的；要變更國家的領土，非依法定的手續不可，否則即是違憲叛國。至於割裂國家的領土，而使之不復完整，也是人民所不容許。國家的政製可以因時制宜而改變，可是國家領土的完整，卻絕對不許在和平的煙幕之下來犧牲。</p>
<p>（三）政治民主。我們要的是直民主，就是實施全民政治。三民主義的政治，我們隻可惜它以前沒有真正實行，卻并不要換一種主義。而況中共也稱三民主義為中國今日之所必需，願為在民主義而奮鬥，毛澤東氏的信徒又在說他的「新民主義義」就是三民主義之實行，那我們就有權要求全國各地區在政治民主作風上大家認真競賽。假使特務政治非但不改而且更強化，人民的基本權利非但沒有保障而且更被剝奪，那就距離民主更遠，決不是人民所希望的和平的結果。</p>
<p>（四）經濟平等。惟能平纔能和，故和平如不能建築在經濟平等的基礎上，道和平的象牙塔也是搖搖欲墮的。今天政府施政的最大缺點，就在於沒有實行民生主義，使社會財富不能達到相當的均衡。中國社會并不需要共產主義，并不必硬性廢除私有財產制度，但確不能容許任何形式的權門豪富肆無忌憚的剝削，便貧者愈貧，富者愈富，而陷整個社會於不均不安的狀態中。我們主張國家用社會政策來使社會財富有合乎情理的重分配，但不贊成利用暴力，作循環不已的「清算」「鬥爭」，在「翻身」的盲目號召下，使一般人同歸於盡，大家都成了「大貧」。我們希望在和平的條件中，要保障人民在經濟平等的原則下，都能安居樂業，努力於生產運銷。</p>
<p>（五）思想自由。人生之所以可貴，不僅賴於物質生活的享受，尤繫乎有自由的精神生活。因為人有人性，性是大賦的，完全自由的，西哲所謂「人生而自由」，憲即指此。一個人如果思想沒有自由，那就喪失了生趣。「不自由，毋寗死」，就是指的思想自由，而言論自由出版自由新聞自由等等都屬之。我們人民所堅決力爭的，也就是思想自由的生活方式必須保持。假使因為祇要苟安偷生，政府就不惜在和平的幌子下，出賣我們人民思想自由的基本人權，那無異買櫝還珠，所獲得的必然是假和平的寶鼎。</p>
<p>如所周知，中國人民在今日并無奢望，但求國家獨立，領土完整，政治民主，經濟平等，思想自由，這五點能夠保障，我們願見國家在和平中獲得生氣。政府應當针對人民的希望，把握這個契機，開誠布公向中共要求迅派代表開始和談。中共的領袖們也當深深體味到人民的意思，拋棄迷信武力統一的幻夢，毅然派遣代表，根據這五原則來磋商和平的條件。至於我們人民更不可妄自菲薄，只顧袖手旁觀，一任時局的自然演變。我們應該把握這個共軍準備渡江而戰火尚未重燃的時機，羣策羣力，一致起來呼號，不許任何一方放槍，不許任何一方越江打仗，一切聽候和平談判。在目前，長江彷彿是一道和平的天然界綫；誰超過了這條界綫進攻，誰就是口唱假和平的戰爭販子！</p>

<h3>蘇加速滲入新疆　華盛頓星報刊載論文加以評述</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十九日電〕華盛頓星報刋載史托達特之論文評述紅軍滲入新疆，及加緊對華控制問題。史氏謂：共黨在中國勝利以後，不論中國共產政權結果對莫斯科有何利益，莫斯科必然有組織的滲入中國本土以西之廣大屬地，此乃無可疑義者。蒙古·新疆與西藏，天然資源有限，其對蘇聯價值，大半屬於戰略方面，一經到手，就可控制亞洲全部心臟，并能對中國與印度，同樣施加壓力。蘇聯擴張之第一階段，早已發生於廿五年以前，共黨將外蒙古變成服從莫斯科的「人民共和國」，今且擴展及於內蒙古，同時，蘇聯現正加速滲入新疆，新疆雖地處僻遠，但東可由中國滲入，西可由土耳其斯坦的其他部分滲入，新疆在古時為旅行商隊之重要的鏈環，中國對新疆之有效控制，始於兩世紀以前，然迄未將新疆「中國化」，不論回教徒與非回教徒，移殖新疆也未成功，今日新疆漢人幾乎隻有警備軍隊·官員與食客。</p>
<p>五年前所發生的叛變，從未絞平，目前重要性在於此種支援，其中多少係以蘇聯官方為其後盾。西土耳其斯坦在佈爾雪維克革命以後已有激烈改變，凡此實有利於蘇聯對東土耳其斯坦的計劃，同時在新疆的土耳其人年來，沙皇統治與中國主人同受歧視，今日蘇聯宣傳，仍遭遇到堅強反對，良以新疆土耳其斯坦人多乃虔誠的回教徒之故，彼等保守性之經濟與社會思想，在本能上皆屬反抗共產主義者，然不幸中國統治無能，惹怒居民，遂使彼等傾向蘇聯。最近發生之叛變，顯然有蘇聯在背後支持，莫斯科已再度立足於新疆門口。</p>
<p>事實上有種種跡象證明中國當局正願與莫斯科求得協議，從現在情形以觀，實難阻止蘇聯之予取予求，新疆將成為蘇聯保護國。目前叛逆政權已組其土耳其斯坦「共和國」。設新疆為蘇聯所控制，後果殊屬嚴重，第一，中國本已在北方為蘇維埃蒙古所包圍，今則又將為另一蘇維埃衛星國所包圍，因勢必增加蘇聯對中國之壓力，第地，新疆受控制後，使莫斯科有直接通路，由喀什米爾而達印度，此一遙遙山地的高原「亞洲的屋頂」，縣於印度之上，進而包圍中國。蘇聯滲入新疆，雖屬困難之事，但非不可能者，一俟蘇聯滲入西藏，則其對亞洲心臟之控制，可謂已告完成矣。</p>
<h3>杭市蒙面盜落網</h3>

<h3>共區通貨膨脹嚴重　引起匯率物價工資等項複雜問題　「人民銀行」津分行舉辦實物存款</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕中共受通貨膨脹影響可由各種跡象證明，北平陷落後數星期，對北平匯款可獲有利的匯率，即金圓劵匯平，換取人民票，可得較大之購買率。但上星期對平匯款突然停止，原因不甚明瞭，但傳聞匯率業已急劇降低，數日後此間又宣佈匯款可以由指定之五家銀行承辦，但各該銀行并無熱烈承辦之表示，理由亦不甚明顯，或謂因南北分行缺乏聯絡關係，或謂此間財政財政對於開辦對華北各城市匯業，態度仍然冷淡。一部份銀行家則認為實因平津匯率殊為不利，使匯款人與受款人兩受損失，華北當局甚至或將嘗試實施官定匯率，官定匯率即凍結幣值之謂，去年金圓劵發行之初，國民政府嘗試凍結失敗，中共已發生通貨膨脹現象，無可諱言，但至最近為止，各方證明人民票尚未如金圓劵之膨脹厲害耳，但直至最近為止，中共并不在應付都會經濟。中共之農村經濟，并不過份倚重貨幣。中共過去並未從事管理與供養大城市之工作，此刻必須負起此種責任，因而陷於國民政府同樣通貨膨脹之覆轍。共幣亦無充份準備，故不免膨脹，因而引起匯率·物價管制與工資指數之同樣複雜問題，或謂共方所以遮蔽平津新聞，此為理由之一。</p>

<h3>重慶艦史實</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕重慶號軍艦於一九三七年建造完成，是一艘重七千噸的戰鬥巡洋艦，艦身長五百零五呎，闊五十一呎。艦上有六里裝甲主力砲六門，分裝在三個砲塔，電動控制。四時副砲八門，高射平射兩用，分裝在四個砲塔。高射機關槍八挺。六時砲指揮台一座，四時砲指揮兩座，均配有指揮儀器，可以使砲火集中射擊。二十一時管魚雷發射器六門，分裝在左右舷。深水炸彈從艦尾發射，防禦潛艇破雷衛兩具，并有磁性水雷防衛電網，又有雷達四組，其一供空中警戒，一供海面警戒，其餘兩組為空中及海面作戰之用。馬力六萬四千匹，最高航速每小時可達三十海里，續航率四千海里。</p>
<p>該艦原名奥路勒號（Aurora），在第二次世界大戰期間先担任北海護航，繼參加擊沉德艦隊俾斯麥之役，後調地中海參加北菲登陸戰，專門對付義大利艦隊，曾擊沉義國運輸艦十六艘之多。該艦最輝煌而聞名於世的一次戰蹟，是與一艘裝有八時口徑砲的義大利巡洋艦的遭遇戰。雖然火力較弱，卻奮勇迎戰，終於打得那艘義艦受創而逃。由於是次光輝的戰蹟，當時該艦得到了一個動人的「銀光鬼」的渾號。一九四三年六月歐戰非常緊張的時期，英王會乘該艦至馬爾泰島檢閱守軍。</p>
<p>大戰結束後，英國將該艦贈與我國，并助我訓練海軍。一九四六年底，我海軍軍官及學生六百餘人赴樸資茅斯在英海軍中任下級幹部及普通士兵，受訓一年餘，至一九四八年五月十九日，該艦及「靈甫號」艦始正式交與我方。莊嚴簡單的贈艦典禮於是日中午在樸資茅斯港舉行，主持典禮的是樸資茅斯港海軍總司令福拉塞上將。代表受艦的是我駐英大使鄭天錫。</p>
<p>五月二十六日，該艦即由艦長鄧兆祥率領受訓完畢之官兵駕駛返國，於八月中駛抵南京。九月初來滬辦理給養後，適值東北戰事緊張之際，該艦曾戰蔣總統至營葫蘆島指揮作戰。東北易手時，在葫蘆島掩護五十二軍撤退，又曾在渤海擊沉不少自大連開往煙臺的共方船隻。</p>
<p>重慶號的缺點消耗量極大，作戰時每日消耗油量約需百餘噸，平時停泊期間，每日亦需柴油十餘噸。據悉：該艦每日開支不下於一正規軍隊旅團之數值。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十九日電〕柏林反共民主黨機關報週聲午報今日載稱，據接近蘇佔區之德國經委會方面消息，蘇佔區內自三月廿三日起，將以一種德國新馬克代東馬克，此舉乃奉最近由莫斯科抵此之蘇專家之命令作決者，以圍阻東馬克由西區回至東區。但此項消息尚未能證實。</p>

<h3>答復北大西洋盟約　蘇將採取反措施　東德提早舉行軍事演習</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿日電〕據星期快報今晨某權威方面消息稱，渠相信蘇聯對政府大西洋公約之答復，不就即將採取大規模之措施。此項措施可能有下列數項：（一）蘇聯將宣佈起早東歐防衛公約，團結一切東歐國家於蘇聯旗幟之下，以與西方對抗。（二）蘇聯及其衛星國將展開猛烈之外交反攻對付西方國家。（三）蘇聯將企圖對某數西方國家政府造成多種無以應付之新困難。（四）蘇聯將召返駐各國之外交家會商。</p>
<p>星期紀事報則強調紅軍在東德即將舉行大規模演習之重要，認為歐洲最近事件，使該項演習提早於廿二日舉行，而不照預定於四月初之日期舉行。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十九日電〕此間西方觀察家預料，蘇聯對大西洋公約之反措施，可能為：（一）廢棄英蘇及法蘇友好條約，（二）正式組織東歐集團，（三）普遍之和平攻勢，（四）由蘇聯在聯大會提出決議，譴責大西洋公約違反聯合國憲章。但一般相信，蘇聯將不致與大西洋簽約國斷絕或退出聯合國。</p>

<h3>重慶艦四十余官兵　遺留在滬分別安挿　牟副艦長人為炸毀意義在整飭軍紀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕重慶號巡洋艦未奉命令，擅駛華北海面時，艦上官兵共計五百八十七人。尚有官兵四十四名，及副艦長牟秉劍，因公上岸，渠等事畢返艦時，始發覺重慶號已悄然北駛。目前此四十餘官兵，均經牟副舰长分別安揷，牟氏本人亦將於下月一日　至海總服務。</p>
<p>據牟氏談：重慶號自江南造船廠調泊吳淞口時，當時局勢動蘯，故保持機動性，燃料配備均帶足，使其能應付一切事變。其出走之原因，百思不得其解。軍艦與飛機不同，少數人士即有異動，亦不能強制該艦北駛。唯一之解答，當為艦長接獲偽造命令，逕自出海北上，船長在海上之權威，高於一切，命令一出，衆無異辭。惟以鄧艦長之個性而言，乃極端守法之人，似不致有此異動；真相如何，非至有艦上官兵歸來，不能確定。就軍事觀點言，華北東北各海港，除旅順大連之外，無一處可供此巨艦停泊修理者，大沽雖有設備，只能供小型輪船使用，無法修理重慶艦，經常之修理工作，對於任何類型之船隻，均為不可或缺者，如不能停泊旅大，重慶號即使不南返，但因缺乏保養設備，在華北海面六個月後，亦將不能使用。同時中共獲此巨艦，亦無軍事價值，因艦上人員不敷，值勤不夠分配，在留滬之四十四官兵中，即有十四人為管理輪機之熟手，故就技術觀點言，此艦雖在中共手中，亦不致立即對此間構稱重大威脅，當局現派空軍將其炸毀，恐含有整饬军纪之意義在內。按牟副艦長乃於上月廿二日因公赴京，及返滬時重慶號已潛行。牟氏甚慶幸本身未捲入此事件，但重要衣物已隨此巨艦之北行而損失殆盡；因當時局勢不靖，海軍人員均將重要衣物置於艦上，以防意外，不料上海平靜無事，兵艦本身反先發生問題也。</p>
<p>見習艦長盧東閣　老母妻兒均在滬</p>

<h3>三毛樂園會　四月四日　籌募基金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「三毛」是漫畫家張樂平筆底下的一個兒童，描寫他因為無家而開始流浪，過著顛沛流離的生活，受盡種種冷酷的待遇。時至今日，社會裏正不知有多少和三毛同樣遭遇的苦孩子，在饑餓和風雨裏掙扎着生活，受受盡冷酷而享受不到人間的溫暖。為此，孫夫人宋慶齡主持的中國福利基金會特進行組織一個永久性的「三毛樂園會」，定四月四日兒童節那天起徵求會員·該會並定於是日起，假座大新公司四樓舉行三毛書展，以及展覽該會兒童福利工作狀況與陶行知創辦的育才學校照片圖表多張，籌募兒童福利基金。所得款額及用品，都將交作這批兒童的教育和醫藥費用。</p>

<h3>銀元販集中　未見成事實　欺詐行為時常發生　管理實有加強必要</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕當局日前曾公佈對銀元販實施管理，並指定十七處營業地點，規定集中營業，惟迄已數日，尚未見正式做到。近一週來，銀元販之從業人數更與日俱增，以前在馬路邊做攤販交易者，亦均加入銀元買賣陣容。現估計每日依賴此項交易生活之人數，至少當在兩萬以上。渠等原無一定組織，目前分佈之區域純係着眼於交通便利，或中等以下家庭集中地段，及普通商店較多之處，俾易與一般薪水階級或商店職員保持接觸。倘一旦強迫遷地集中營業，則渠等將因交易機會較少而大感反對，故實行時亦必多困難。警局目前暢遊逮捕銀元販時間，惟其原因係在取締渠等妨礙交通，或破壞秩序。事實上銀元販中流品龐雜，每日亦常有欺騙顧客行為發生：如以銀壳夾入銅片製成銀元賣出，收進時又以大鈔夾入小票混充整數付價，致買賣雙方屢起紛擾。欲使此點能得改善，當局實有迅籌辦法加強管理之必要·在金銀市塲未告成立前，銀元販對一般薪水階級至少尚不失為一種互通有無及保持幣值之對象，果管理得當，一般市民及其買賣雙方亦可望在經濟生活上稍獲保障。除銀元販外，目前鄰近中區之各烟紙店，亦多開始兼營銀元交易，且逐日掛牌標示進出市價，此種情景頗易使人憶及十五年前銀幣兌換銅幣時之情況。</p>
<h3>豪華列車　歸真反璞　拆除冷氣設備後　恢復行駛京滬綫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕去年夏末轟動全國鐵路界之冷氣飛快車，自出廠後，行駛京滬綫上，未及半載，即遭逢因政院南遷及浩繁軍運所引起之大混亂，京滬區鐵路局對此流綫型冷氣列車異常珍視，即將此列車停止行駛，入戚　堰機車廠「避難」，故在「大混亂」期中，飛快車未收絲毫損傷。路局認為在此時期內無需如此豪華完善之列車，為適應環境，現正計劃將該列車原有雙層封固式之車窗，改裝為可以自由開閉之活動車窗，冷氣設備亦將予以拆除。前經中大美術教授設計之車廂色澤，亦擬盡行塗抹，改漆一色墨綠，使與其他頭等車廂一律，車中活動安樂椅則仍舊保持·總之，務使此貴族化火車，脫盡「貴族氣」，一俟改裝就緒，即可恢復行駛京滬綫上云。</p>

<h3>華聯驚風駭浪　三球壓倒麥令　黎隊星華拼成平手　東華老將擊退懋勋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽，昨晚男女組均有緊張精采鏡頭，華聯雖以卅八比卅二壓倒麥令斯，但四十分鐘內，局勢始終驚險，無片刻安定，上半時十四鄙視三，佔先僅一分·女子組星華黎隊戰成卅九平局，各得積分一分。另塲甲乙東華勝懋勋，四五比卅二。</p>
<p>壓軸大戰，華聯以傅金聲，包松圓，劉福善，吳成章，李震中五將來對付，麥令斯由利斯，高萊茀，茀勞特，喬克生，歐恩蓋先上塲·肉搏四分鐘，麥令歐恩蓋因老包犯規得一分·繼歐再得一分，福善的貽誤戎機，老包的球運不開，幾使利斯在籃下托進稱四分。氣氛中華聯由劉罰中一分，成章又推入一球，忽見利斯又猖獗，華聯為之瞠目。松圓好不容易添了一球，六比五尚差一分。阿傅前失罰球，又二投未入，　聲四起，麥令萊姆賽替出歐恩蓋後，　中得分，從此始成均勢，由七平而九平，麥令博雷茂代茀勞特，金聲空心球，成十一比九，麥令漸感辣手，即平日之神射手，居然冷飯都沒有偷到，他們投籃的失常，於此可見。在這樣狀態中，華聯的慌亂，也毫無成績·</p>
<p>高茀萊與喬克生方各中一球，老包顯顏色，上半時幸以十四比十三勝一分。</p>
<p>下半時嘉洲代金聲，彼方隊長利斯依然兇狠，上塲瞬息一球，吳樂各罰一分，大李捧入，高茀萊與成章喬克生葛優苗頭，松圓每恨難中，利斯的一擲，成功廿二比廿一，華聯又僅半球佔優勢。老包的二雙罰球將功贖罪，震中遠投，小樂跟進，聲勢稍勝·不料最後三分鐘形勢驟變，麥令連中兩球，卅六比卅二，華聯不敢偷安，四十分鐘完塲，卅八比仨二，麥令斯終被壓倒。</p>

<h3>女子籃球術</h3>
<p>— 戚公譯述</p>
<p>這幾套戰術實際地運用起來，則（圖式）之防守方式在運用時可變為（圖八）之防守方式，守衛應該憑其他本人的判斷力，視情形之之變化而行動，佈陣時有如（圖式）在變化運用時則變為（圖八）之動態了。</p>
<p>同時用時則變化為（圖九）之陣式。（圖四）之陣式在運用時變化為（圖十）之陣式。</p>
<p>四項之移動區域制陣式，除從中圈發球之應付方式外，其他三個陣式（圖五，六，七）苟能嫺熟地運用，必收效果。</p>
<p>每個圖中之彎曲黑綫是指示進攻者得持球在手後，守衛者須離開其原來之位置而預定奔跑之路線，籃球已被傳遞到她的區域內，她有看管該球與持球者之責任。</p>
<p>守衛在防禦時必須要保持着劃一的局裏與聯繫，倘若在中衛之位置與其他兩守衛過於接近，則攔截對方傳遞出之球的機會較少，反而予進攻者閃躲而入之機會，其結果是以兩位守衛來看管一位進攻者，致其他區域成為空檔，而該區域之守衛者要以一人來看管兩位進攻者，未免是負擔過重。</p>
<p>所以從上述可以提醒守衛者在採用區域防禦制時候，往往會犯上述和下列之簡單錯誤，致使全部防禦陷於崩潰之地步，未能發生防禦之效果。以下是採取區域防禦制時，守衛容易發生普遍的錯誤。</p>
<p>（一）甲進攻者已將球傳遞給別以為乙進攻者後，看管着甲進攻者的守衛仍然跟隨着甲進攻者，無異於採用人釘人制。</p>
<p>（二）守衛者在防禦時不將視綫注視在球體上，致往往未知發揮預感力而不能收到預期攔截對方傳遞出之球的效果。</p>
<p>（三）移動防禦時，距離得過遠，最另一個區域顯露出有空檔，倘攻者突然改在對過之區域進攻，則守衛勢必來不及橫貫過塲來掩護以阻撓該區之攻</p>
<p>（四）移動得過早，—預期判斷錯誤，意以為該進攻者將要接到另一位進攻者之傳遞，守衛者向前衝去得較早，致給予另一區域以竄入之機會。</p>
<p>（五）在移動時續步向後退，無異續漸護進攻者得迫近而活的投籃之位置。區域防禦制之主要戰略是要將進攻者拒住在容易投籃射程之內，就是在鑰匙孔眼界綫之外，守衛者倘若續漸地後退，不知不覺地是給予進攻者居於有力投篮之位置。</p>
<p>這是初學打籃球者最容易犯有之普遍的錯誤，致致區域防禦全失效果，還須要記牢的，倘若對方之進攻者是精於遠投的，那麼，守衛者所防禦之區域應擴展到中央界綫處。</p>
<p>（六）進攻者在每一次傳遞後，守衛者仍不做移動之動作，全不移動與稍移動之數寸之距離，這仍是會得不到攔截對方傳遞之機會。（未完·六）</p>

<h3>「可喜」集</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>處今之世，凡事應從「好」的方面想。</p>
<p>比方說，通貨惡性膨脹，固然有礙國民經濟；然製造僞鈔之徒，卻因而望而卻步鈔聲匿跡，未嘗不是民族道德提高之徵象。可喜之一！</p>
<p>再如，電車票價太貴，小市民深感負担不起，難免嘖有煩言，但其好處似乎更多：</p>
<p>上下車秩序大大改善，不稪爭先恐後；</p>
<p>車廂內人各有座，彼此相敬如賓，不復相互排擠傾軋；</p>
<p>司機者每站必停，不復和乘客破口對駡；</p>
<p>凡此一新中外觀瞻的良好風氣，得在一朝一夕獲得充分表現，實皆車票加價之功也。</p>
<p>又：小市民因此而皆能案步當車，實與節約之旨，健康之道，深為符合。可喜之二！</p>
<p>香煙太貴，小公敎人員都吸不起了，無不怨聲載道，豈知新生活運動卻不推而行了。戒煙戒了幾百次的人們，現在可以一償宿願了。可喜之三！</p>
<p>經濟破產，金融混亂，自然人所頭痛，但好處至少有一端：「生活指數」，「銀根鬆而現鈔缺」，「良幣驅惡幣」……等等的經濟學知識，都已為大衆所普遍知曉，連中學生們也深知「拆息」，「貼現」，「重貼現」等術語的個中道理；過去在課堂中不易解釋的經濟問題，現在都不成問題了。長此以往，大家都有經濟腦筋，經商天才，國何患而不富？可喜之西！</p>
<p>學費過昂，都說妨敎育前途；然而唯其學費高，求學難，方足使每個在學學生，時時警惕，深懂用功苦學之必要，而學潮也自然消減於無形，此於敎育前途大有裨益將來因苦學而成名的人才必多。可喜之五！</p>
<p>處今之世，凡事一從「光明面」想，一往遠處看，則無不令人新人樂觀！信不信由你。</p>
<h3>鐘</h3>
<p>— 以是</p>
<p>你或許會疑問，在鐘未發明前，人們用什麼來計時？</p>
<p>千餘年前的埃及，有一種計時器，那是一隻銅碗，碗底有一小孔，當太陽昇起時，卽把此碗浮在通衢旁的水上。水從孔中緩慢地流入碗裏，水滿時，便有守望者鑼敲一下，以示一段定長的時間已過去；，第二碗滿時，便敲二下，如此直至晚間為止。英國也曾以一支刻成十二段等長的蝦燭來計時，一日一夜共需點完六支，每三段約等於現在一小時。中國古時用的漏，也是計時器，而都不能正確，且頗勞力費錢。</p>
<p>至公元一六〇九年，意大利科學家利略以發條及齒輪間的關係而發明時鐘，這才是個大革命，不但正確省費，且堅固耐用，故立被世界採用。但時鐘計時，由於地磁和氣溫等影響，並不能完全凖確。在不斷的改進中，最近原子鐘的發明，完成了更進一步的貢獻，每三百萬年衹差一秒，已接近絕對性的凖確了。</p>

<h3>閒居中處自白</h3>
<p>— 仲銘</p>
<p>閒居了長久，精神也懶散了長久。當閒居之妝，就想到乘此長日無事，大可多寫一迠文章了。曾擬定若干題目。立了若干計劃，但結果卻一無所成。悠悠數月，混混而過。這倒也沒有什麼，因為天下本無事，何必庸人自擾之呢？至於計劃云云，本是開玩笑的東西，計劃愈詳細，成績亦必愈式微，幾曾看見有人依照計劃按步實施的？則我之混混而過，自不足怪。</p>
<p>最近結束了閒居生活，更易了新的環境，對一切都起有新的感覺。當靜坐無聊之時，眞的頗想寫點文章。記得朋友朱朱君在他的詩集的序文裏，曾有過這樣的話：「一篇篇寫出，能使自己的老婆贊一聲好，已覺十分榮幸；至於萬人傳誦，洛陽紙貴，與傳之千古，藏之名山這些話，道是我一向把它當作神話看了。」我對於寫文章，就是這種心境。而且我還以為文章不能寫得太好；寫得太好了，給人家的印象，祇是承認你是一個寫文章的人，於是所有做官發財等差事統統不會挨到你身上來。所能找得你的，祗是請你寫篇文章。你想，這可多麼悲哀？</p>
<p>得意的趣味是濃烈的，閒居的趣味是沖淡的。也可以說，得意是一種動的趣味，閒居是一種靜的趣味。我今年閒居了很長一個時期，欲語說「靜極思動」，我則靜極了就更不想動。最近動到這十里洋塲來，不是我自己要動，而是人家要我動。所廳怪的是：這一動，使我靜下來了。在家裏，還有朋友的酬酢，親戚的往來，而現在住在這區域中，倒好像是隠居山林。寫字間很大，「寫字」者則一共祇有三人，各人都佔據了一角，事務清閒，終日默坐而已，進門先練坐功，我吃過寫字問飯，早有此種經騐，自然見怪不怪。祇是每日下午六點鐘後，同室的兩位朋友別有去處，時常我一人在室中獨坐，這才有點靜得可怕。</p>
<p>當靜坐得心煩之後，我也想到了動。這個動，說來很簡單，就是起立踱方步。在寫字間里，徘徊復徘徊，連續的轉動，常會踱上半小時，或竟一小時以上。有時從玻璃窗外舉頭望明月，低頭望草地，靜中呆想，會忍不住笑出來。這個笑，不是自鳴得意，而是笑自己會變成這樣安馴。過去朋友批評我的人生是一篇八股文，我還自以為是一篇散文。現在想想，不是八股，也不是散文，簡直成了一卷佛經了。</p>
<p>因為太閒。我又想終日所用心要被人為小人，於是當靜坐之中。也動動腦筯。腦筯一動，思緒甚多，惜可形諸文字者還是很少；因為我目前的人生雖像一卷佛經，但我究竟六根未淨，我還想好好做人，要把我所有的思緒全部據實寫出來。我很明白，寫得意的文章不能吃飯，過得意的生活才有辦法。把輕薄的思緒寫出來，在文章上是可以自鳴得意的，然而這得意沒有用，對於做人究非所宜。連年為了寫文章吃了不少虧，現在我自己覺得進步了，——我已有了「文章不再寫得太得意」的聰敏。</p>

<p>上星期，去看一塲足球，兩邊都都有幾個頗為「名見經傳」的球員。性質是「友誼賽」，但結果卻踢得十分不「友誼」，到後來動作粗暴，互相撞人，觀衆也吶喊助威，高聲喊打，差點兒弄成了全武行。我看完出來，不禁搖頭歡氣。</p>
<p>去年，我風從美國回來，下碰上全運會。我自己雖然是學農的，且架深度近視眼鏡，但對運動卻大有興趣，尤其是愛看足球，所以全運會的每塲足球賽，自然都不放過。不過，從頭看到底，卻不料只見從頭打架到底，除幾塲實力十分縣懸殊的比賽而外。尤其到最後決賽週時，因為那幾隊都是軍人隊，甚至有帶了掛手槍的啦啦隊來的，兩邊一上塲，就像是眼睛血紅，凖備開槍的樣子，弄得裁判都不敢下去吹叫子，只好由總裁判自出馬。如此怪現象，眞是頭一遭見到。想來，總也是因為中國人對於這「勝」「負」兩字，看得太嚴重了。聽說當時決賽前夕，某隊領隊曾警吿他的隊員們說：「你們此賽非勝不可，否則不要回來見我！」這是什麼話？倒有點像京戲裏的「立下軍令狀去」了。如果兩隊領隊都叫他的隊員「非勝不可」，那末可叫誰來輸呢？豈不是只有叫裁判挨打服輸了麼？</p>
<p>我這美國讀書的幾年，是個標凖足球迷，賣到五塊，十坂一張門券的比賽，也照樣要去看過明白。美國的足球，不是我們踢的這種，球像個靑菓橄欖，球在手時，可撞可攔可壓，我們通常稱之為橄欖球的。如果他們也是像我國的球員那樣肝火旺，不動就要暗暗揍人一拳或踢人一腳，那是一塲球比下來，起嗎可以揍死一半人的。但他們比球，卻無不依照規則辦理，競賽雖驚險張萬分，但揍人或揍裁判的事，我竟從沒有見過。</p>
<p>有一件事曾予我深刻印象，永不致忘。那年，我們校隊和普林斯登校隊舉行年賽，事前我校敎練集中球員，埋頭苦練，研究戰術，凖備了很久。到出發比賽前夕，向隊旗行宣誓式，校長和敎練，領隊都親自到塲，儀式雖簡單而莊嚴隆重，由校長主持，率領全體隊員祝吿上蒼。祝吿很簡單，只有四句話，但當時曾使我感動得幾至下淚。那四句話是：</p>
<p>「如果勝，讓我們光榮地勝；如果敗，讓我們光榮地敗。」</p>
<p>這眞是何等風度，何等氣慨！勝，就光榮地勝；敗，就光榮地敗。這不但是打球的精神，也是做人應有的精神。結果，我們校隊不幸以一示之差敗於普林斯登，球員們和敎練當然都心中懊喪（這是人情之常，免不了的），但無不表示戾服，因為對方確實技高一着。無論如何，絕沒有總見任何一人說要揍普林斯登的球員，或遷堅於判的。</p>
<p>那天回到宿舍，一位美國同學問我，中國比球是否也如此，我連忙回答說當然當然，並舉例說，中國古代射箭，還要「揖上而升，下而飲，其爭也君子」；中國社會上還有句老話，叫做「勝固可喜，敗亦欣然」，可見中外都是相同的。</p>
<p>當時我其實並無意思要說謊。但現在，如果我再碰到這位美國同學，一定要大大臉紅了。</p>
<p>什麼時候，我們眞能有這種光明磊落的胸襟，「勝固可喜，敗亦欣然」呢？</p>

<h3>New Cabinet Possibly Formed Today; Policy Guidelines to be Drafted; Earnest Implementation Based on Four Major Goals</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] After Acting President Li intervened to urge him on, there has been significant progress on the list of the new cabinet members on the 20th, but a final decision has not yet been reached. Negotiations with all parties will continue on the 21st, with the possibility of the cabinet being formed on the 21st. He Yingqin invited Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, Weng Wenhao, and others to meet at his official residence on the morning of the 20th to discuss the matter and spent the entire day on long-distance calls to Shanghai, awaiting replies. It is learned that the ministries of Transportation, Finance, and Justice are still problematic among the entire list of cabinet members. A decision has been made to choose one of Shen Yi and Ling Hongxun for Transportation, while Xu Kan is still being requested to take on the Finance portfolio. There is no suitable candidate for Justice at the moment. Those who have been decided are Li Hanhun for Minister of Interior, Chuan Bingchang for Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sun Yueqi for Minister of Economic Affairs, He Yingqin concurrently for Minister of National Defense, Hang Liwu for Minister of Education, Bai Yunti for Minister of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs, and Dai Kuisheng for Minister of Overseas Chinese Affairs. However, the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs was the original decision, but since the selection of the Minister of Foreign Affairs is related to national policy, no contact has yet been made with Chuan. As for the seven positions of political committee members, a decision has been made to reserve one or two positions for the Democratic and Youth Parties. The remaining five positions have been decided for Zhang Cui, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhu Jiahua, and Guan Jiyu, with another person under consideration. According to authoritative sources close to He Yingqin on the 20th, He's selection of cabinet members will first avoid the appointment of personal favorites and will also avoid interference, granting He full authority. He emphasizes peace, reduces partisanship, so as not to stimulate the CCP. He's new cabinet originally aimed at transcendence, new people, and new policies. Although the individuals invited are gradually changing, these two principles remain unchanged.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] While the list of new cabinet members is still under careful selection, the policy guidelines for the new cabinet have already been undertaken by those responsible for drafting them under He's direction. The main points are based on the four major goals of "seeking peace, political reform, stabilizing the economy, and securing the people's livelihood," and efforts will be made to avoid complex and redundant wording, aiming for brevity and practicality to facilitate implementation. These guidelines are expected to be drafted within two days and submitted to He. After the list of cabinet members is announced and the new cabinet is declared formed, it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for a report.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] According to those close to He Yingqin, the work to be undertaken immediately after the establishment of the new cabinet includes the following points: (1) Adjustment of salaries for public educators. (2) Handling of personnel left behind by the Sun cabinet in Guangzhou. (3) Rectification of current financial and economic problems. Furthermore, after the announcement of the establishment of the new cabinet, the important personnel of all ministries and commissions will restore the original office forms of each ministry, and the Executive Yuan will move its offices to the Lixingshe, which is currently being arranged.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party will take the night train to Shanghai on the 20th to consult with members of the party regarding joining the cabinet.

<h3>Post, Telegraph, and Railways Price Increases Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 20th] The 21st was originally the date for price increases for post, telegraph, and railways.

<h3>First Joint Symposium of Legislative and Supervisory Yuan Members; Decision to Strengthen Ties Between the Two Yuan and Hold Meetings Once a Month Thereafter; Seek Work Coordination to Promote Efforts to Achieve Peace and Reform Politics</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] The joint symposium of members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan meeting in Nanjing was changed to begin on the 20th, and it was decided that it would be held once a month thereafter to exchange opinions on the current situation and to seek work coordination to help the government eliminate corruption and incompetence, and reform politics. The symposium on the 20th was the first. Approximately 300 members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan attended, including Yu Youren and Tong Guanxian. Li Mengbiao was publicly elected chairman. From 9:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., a total of 20 committee members spoke, and their opinions were divided into two points. One was to strive for peace and reform politics, with many criticizing the current unreasonable phenomena. The other was to seek to strengthen the ties between the two Yuan and exert their power. The Supervisory Yuan specifically raised the issue of the Supervisory Law, which restricts the exercise of supervisory power, and requested the Legislative Yuan to support the proposed amendments by the Supervisory Yuan. The speeches of the committee members were very impassioned. Regarding the former, Legislative Yuan member Kong Geng called for unity to start from within, and that peace must have the guarantee of life and freedom. Legislative Yuan member Xu Panqun believed that the state of the nation is due to the non-implementation of the constitution, and that the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee of a single party can make the final decision, which is truly questionable. Therefore, he advocated ending party rule. Xu also discussed whether there are other forces preventing decision-makers from implementing policies, which should be studied. Whether resignation is a form of rest, and the time limit for the Vice President to act as President, he argued, should be considered for "rectifying the position and establishing the name." Legislative Yuan member Niu Jianchu advocated overthrowing the privileged class, and that peace cannot be infiltrated with speculative intentions. He supported overall peace, opposed partial peace, supported fair peace, and opposed surrender peace. Legislative Yuan member Wang Bingjun criticized Sun Ke's cabinet for using national transportation to move gold, silver, treasures, children, and even toilets to Hong Kong, which was outrageous. Supervisory Yuan member Ni Bi explained that in the past, people hated the Communist Party, so they supported the suppression of the rebellion. Now, because the National Army (such as in northern Jiangsu) demands things and even women, the people do not serve willingly, so they hope for peace. The gun-holding class believes that they can still fight, which is an absurd idea. Currently, to seek peace, one must admit defeat. Acting President Li and Premier Sun have both admitted defeat, and the reason for the defeat is the corruption of discipline and the disintegration of the people's hearts. If discipline is not rectified, it will not only be impossible to fight, but also impossible to have peace. Legislative Yuan member Pan Lianfang believed that the powerful families should be overthrown. Representatives from the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan should vote to determine who are the powerful families, and then investigate the source of their wealth. Illegitimate wealth should be confiscated by the state to curb inflation and rising prices. Legislative Yuan member Miao Chunlin believed that the powers of the two Yuan cannot be exercised due to a force with more than 20 years of history obstructing them. He advocated taking the two Yuan as the center, uniting all reform forces, and supervising the Executive Yuan to implement reforms. Supervisory Yuan member Cao Dexuan believed that the Supervisory Yuan has failed the people, and the Legislative Yuan has also failed the people, because the Weng cabinet and the Sun cabinet were both approved by the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, he hoped that the Legislative Yuan would exercise its power of consent with caution in the future. Cao believed that the Kuomintang should eliminate corruption, and the Communist Party should eliminate evil. In the past, when the government suppressed the rebellion, various places supported it. Now, when the government seeks peace, various places also support it, which is opportunism. Some places oppose conscription and requisition of grain, but who would oppose the Communist Party conscripting soldiers and requisitioning grain? Some people oppose American aid, but why not oppose the Communist Party accepting Soviet aid? We here have the freedom to hold joint symposiums, but if we go to the Communist area, even farting will be interfered with. Legislative Yuan member Miao Qiping believed that we should atone for our sins and save the nation. Peace must have power, otherwise we can only kowtow to the Communist Party, which is surrender. Regarding the latter, Supervisory Yuan member Li Zhengle said that disciplinary cases sent out three months or even three years ago still have no outcome, so the Supervisory Law must be amended. Legislative Yuan member Li Shijun said that the Supervisory Yuan can impeach and eliminate corruption, and the Legislative Yuan can eliminate incompetence through the system. The two Yuan should have a standing liaison organization, which can be organized by representatives from each Yuan. Legislative Yuan members Wu Wangji and Liu Zhendong both opposed this kind of organization, believing that it has no legal basis and that the number of committee members is too large, and a few cannot represent the majority of committee members. Wu Wangji believed that the two Yuan can hold a joint symposium once a month to exchange opinions on the current situation and mutually support the cases being conducted by both sides. They can also establish contact in terms of continuing education and entertainment. Supervisory Yuan member Cao Dexuan advocated that the two Yuan should each appoint responsible persons to organize review meetings on various issues and exchange opinions. Supervisory Yuan member Tang Honglie supported a symposium once a month and advocated that the Legislative Yuan should appoint six people and the Supervisory Yuan should appoint five people to be responsible for preparation. Tang also believed that the Supervisory Yuan's work of "fighting tigers and swatting flies" is hindered by the "iron wire net" of the Supervisory Law, and he hoped that the Legislative Yuan would assist in removing it. Finally, Legislative Yuan member Kong Geng made a written suggestion that a symposium be held once a month, and the chairman obtained the consent of the meeting to have six Legislative Yuan members and five Supervisory Yuan members responsible for preparation. It was already near noon, and Li Mengbiao made a concluding remark, saying that hearing everyone's insightful remarks, he deeply felt that today's meeting was of great significance, and his own頹唐 (depressed state) was immediately revived, and he dared not consider himself old anymore. What everyone said represents the people, proving that the country has hope, which he felt very fortunate about. The Legislative and Supervisory Yuan are the left and right arms, and there must be close cooperation. In the future, the two Yuan should earnestly connect, advance their work, and exert their strength. He sincerely wished the Republic of China a thousand autumns and ten thousand years, and good health to his colleagues in both Yuan. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Battleship Set on Fire by Bombing in Huludao Port</h3>
<p>On March 18th and 19th, the Air Force continuously flew to Huludao to bomb the Chongqing battleship (arrow indicates the spot), and the picture shows the ship burning after catching fire.</p>
<h3>Thick Smoke Billows from Chongqing Battleship; Most of Huludao Pier Obscured; Supervisory Yuan Members Arrive in Shanghai to Investigate Reasons for Defection</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 20th] After the Chongqing cruiser was hit by three bombs from B24s on the 19th, the oil depot at the stern of the ship caught fire and burned. When a B38 aircraft went to take pictures over Huludao at 5:00 p.m. on the 19th, the billowing smoke from the fire drifted with the wind, obscuring most of the Huludao pier (see picture above).</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] When the Air Force bombed the defecting Chongqing battleship on the 18th and 19th, the ship's anti-aircraft machine guns, eight of 40mm caliber and eight of 20mm caliber, and eight anti-aircraft guns, along with five Communist anti-aircraft guns on the Huludao pier, assisted the defecting battleship in its stubborn resistance. The wind speed was very high that day, and the B24 aircraft chased the defecting battleship in batches over the sky, while resisting the difficulty in aiming caused by the wind speed, and also defending against the harm of 8,000-foot high-altitude artillery shells exploding. Finally, they accomplished the mission of destroying the ship.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 20th] The Chongqing cruiser has a fuel capacity of 1,100 tons, and its fuel consumption during navigation is 5 tons per hour. Fully loaded with heavy oil, it can cruise for 4,000 nautical miles, sailing at sea for nine days and seven hours. During the First European War, the German cruiser Wolf attacked British and American transport ships in the Atlantic Ocean, wreaking havoc for several years and damaging countless American aid supplies. If the defecting Chongqing battleship had no concerns about the Air Force, its mission in the Communist ports would inevitably follow the old path of the German ship Wolf, obstructing American aid and the connection between the Shanghai and Taiwan sea routes.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Two members of the Supervisory Yuan went to Shanghai last night to investigate the documents related to the defection case of the "Chongqing" battleship. The results of the investigation may be used as a basis for impeaching Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing.</p>

<h3>Lessons from the Defection and Bombing of the Chongqing Battleship; Military Affairs Should Undergo Painful Reform; Overthrow Bloodsuckers and Improve the Treatment of Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] After the Chongqing battleship was bombed and sunk, several military personnel expressed their opinions on various aspects of military affairs that need reform. After the defecting Chongqing battleship was hit by the Air Force, although the ship's hull was damaged due to the burning of the oil depot and the explosion of the ammunition depot, the factors that led to the defection still linger in the military, awaiting reform. For twenty years, the National Army, while building the army, has also had some corrupt military phenomena, brought into the army by bloodsuckers. The most obvious of these is that some military leaders seize military power to amass wealth, and then use that wealth to indulge their bodies and muddle their minds, leading to lax military and political affairs and unclear rewards and punishments. In addition, after fighting with the Communist army, the strategies and tactics are all outdated. There is neither a strong military body nor effective application. Combined with the extravagance of the upper levels and the inability of the middle and lower levels to obtain adequate food and clothing, they naturally become a direct line of decline and failure in the Communist army's offensive, without the ability to resist and support. Although there has been some reform in this situation, it is said that there are still some bad phenomena. First, the national treasury currently issues salaries based on the number of people in the establishment, but the actual number of National Army personnel receiving salaries is less than half of this number. The defeat and capture of military leaders such as Zheng Dongguo, Liao Yaoxiang, and Wang Yaowu seem insufficient to serve as a lesson for some military leaders of similar status who are on the front line today. Although some of them can be hardworking, self-motivated, loyal, and responsible, some, driven by the current economic system and the demands of their unscrupulous spouses, still live deep in the cities in the rear, pursuing wealth and neglecting their duties day and night without shame. Every senior American military official, such as Marshall, Wedemeyer, and Barr, has repeatedly and frankly criticized this phenomenon in the Chinese military, but the military has not reformed itself to this day and must wait for the military offensive of the Communist army to overthrow the entire army. Now, because only half of Jiangnan remains, it seems that the final opportunity has arrived for the military to reform and reorganize itself. If this opportunity passes without reform to protect itself and the country, then the Communist army will break through the Jiang defense and cross the river southward, creating the phenomenon of the Communist army being invincible, which is actually caused by the self-corruption of the National Army. According to these military personnel, the way to reform is very simple: the military should conduct a self-examination and decide to implement measures to improve the military body and effective use as goals. These military personnel also said: The Chongqing incident shows that the composition of modern troops and equipment has extremely high economic value. If the treatment and supply of the personnel using this equipment cannot maintain their physical and mental well-being, and if they are placed in a hopeless situation at the end of the century, then problems will arise in the maintenance and use of this extremely valuable equipment. The defection and destruction of the Chongqing cost more than 10 million pounds. If the "treatment issue" was among the factors for the ship's defection, then the 10 million pounds of the ship's value lost this time is enough to supply the entire Chinese Navy with a year of generous living. The navy cannot sell ships to improve their lives, but they should also respect the Western military principle that excellent equipment must be matched with excellent personnel, otherwise, after receiving Western aid, it is difficult to guarantee that similar Eastern incidents will not occur.</p>
<h3>Long Yun Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>Letter to Yunnan Authorities to Investigate and Punish Strictly</p>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 20th] At a time when the Yunnan situation is unstable, there are many rumors about Long Yun, the former chairman of Yunnan Province, and occasionally disgruntled politicians and idle military officers take his name to harm the local people. After Long learned of this in Hong Kong, he expressed extreme anger. In addition to solemnly denying the rumors, he also wrote to the Yunnan authorities to investigate and punish them strictly in order to maintain the safety of his hometown.</p>
<h3>Joint Defense Completed in the 5th and 6th Pacification Zones of Henan and Hubei; Local Communists Attacked Yingcheng Unsuccessfully; Communist Army North of the Yangtze Still in the Deployment Phase</h3>
<p>[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 20th] Military News: The joint defense work between the 5th Pacification Zone of southern Henan and the 6th Pacification Zone of northeastern Hubei has been completed as planned. The 6th Pacification Zone currently governs 20 counties in northern and eastern Hubei, including Xiaogan, Yingcheng, Lishan, and Macheng. It is a pilot zone with effective implementation of the Central China land policy. The commander is Lieutenant General Zhang Guangwei, the former deputy commander of Zhang Gan's army group.</p>
<p>[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 20th] Military sources confirm that more than 7,000 troops under Zhang Tixue of the Communist Jianghan Military Region launched continuous attacks on Yingcheng (90 kilometers from Hankou) in northern Hubei on the 17th and 18th, once approaching the northeastern suburbs of the city to a distance of nine li. They were repelled by reinforcements from a certain unit of Zhang Gan's army group stationed in the city. Today, traffic between Xiaogan and Changjiangbu and Yingcheng is still operating normally.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 20th] Local Communists in central and western Hubei have been showing signs of opportunistic movement in recent days. The National Army is holding a calm stance, and there have been no major engagements so far. In addition, in order to strengthen the defense of the Yangtze River, the authorities have dispatched naval reinforcements to all ports from Yichang downstream to Wuxue upstream.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] In recent days, various bridgeheads of the National Army north of the Yangtze River, such as Yiwei, Kouan, Shijiaqiao, Bazigang, and Yuxikou, have been frequently attacked and harassed by the Communist army, but their nature still remains at the stage of reconnaissance, probing, and disturbance, and has not yet officially launched a full-scale offensive. According to a senior military official speaking to reporters: The troops of Chen Yi, gathered north of the Yangtze River, have increased to eighteen armies. Their main force is stationed along the Huainan Railway and the canal area, while the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is relatively weak. The constant harassment and attacks by the Communist army are obviously intended to cover and facilitate the complete and thorough deployment of their large army. However, according to the official's estimate, large-scale actions against the bridgeheads are unlikely in the near future. However, this does not mean that the Communist army does not intend to capture the bridgeheads as a prelude to crossing the Yangtze River. As for crossing the Yangtze River, it is still too early to say, for the reason that, on the one hand, preparations for crossing the river have not yet been completed, and on the other hand, large-scale crossing cannot be carried out before the bridgehead positions are occupied. Furthermore, it is judged here that the five armies of Lin Biao's troops that went south to Xuzhou have mostly been transferred to southern Henan, and the hearts of the people in Jiangnan, which were once tense, have temporarily calmed down again.</p>
<h3>Situation Stabilized in Guanzhong; National Army Recaptures Dali</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Military News: After the National Army in Guanzhong recovered the line from Gouyi in the west through Tongchuan to Beicheng in the east, the situation has stabilized.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 19th] The Xi'an Pacification Headquarters issued a war report at 6:00 p.m. on the 19th: The National Army's advancing troops captured Dali County City at 4:00 p.m. today.</p>
<h3>Zhang Fakui and Yu Hanmou Arrive in Nanjing from Guangzhou in Response to Summons; Immediately Visit Acting President Li and Premier He After Disembarking; Yu Denies Rumors of Rebellion on the Fujian-Guangdong Border</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Army Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui and Guangzhou Pacification Director Yu Hanmou arrived in Nanjing by plane from Guangzhou at 3:00 p.m. on the 20th in response to Acting President Li's telegram summons. Representatives sent by Acting President Li and Premier He Yingqin welcomed them.

<h3>Editorial: Understanding and Grasping True Peace</h3>
<p>—Five Hopes for President He—</p>
<p>President He claims that the primary tasks of his cabinet are to reform politics and seek peace. Therefore, after the cabinet is formed, it should be a "peace cabinet." However, on the eve of the formation of his peace cabinet, a series of atmospheres contrary to peace have been transmitted one after another. Not only does the Communist army's crossing-the-Yangtze River battle in China seem to be imminent, but the whole world, with the announcement of the North Atlantic Treaty, also seems to smell gunpowder. Under such war pressure, how can the He cabinet achieve the task of seeking peace? This is indeed an extremely difficult task.</p>
<p>We believe that to seek peace today, we must first distinguish between true and false peace. Then, we must do our best to pursue true peace so that we do not fall into the trap of false peace, which would make the entire country and nation unable to extricate themselves.</p>
<p>The distinction between true and false peace has long been a topic of heated discussion within the Communist area, under the instruction of Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Moreover, I am afraid that the Communist Party members and their affiliated groups within the government-controlled area are also responding to the discussion. In their view, of course, the peace advocated and strived for by President Chiang, Acting President Li, President He, and even Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi is all "false peace directed by American imperialism." Only those who follow "Chairman Mao's Eight Articles" respectfully are pursuing true peace. However, to this day, we have not seen or heard that Kuomintang members or ordinary, non-partisan people pay attention to the distinction between true and false peace. For example, the Communist Party believes that only peace in the "Beiping model" can barely be considered true peace. It seems that I saw in a newspaper report that Shao Lizi once said in Beiping that people in the South are willing to have peace in the "Beiping model." Besides that, it seems that no other responses have been heard. We do not know if Shao really said this. If it is true, we do not know what Shao based his statement on. We would like to stand on the side of the people and raise this issue for discussion.</p>
<p>From the 13th to yesterday, this newspaper has continuously published Jiang Xuejun's report on the "Beiping Model." This should give readers a rough outline of the "Beiping Model." In a nutshell, the large slogans written on the walls of Beiping that "Fu Zuoyi surrendered with his troops" are a true depiction of the "Beiping Model!" In fact, Fu Zuoyi not only "surrendered with his troops," but he simply led the people of Beiping to "surrender!" What qualifications do the surrendered soldiers and civilians have to talk about equality and freedom? Therefore, it is not entirely "color blindness" that foreign news agencies only now say that the Chinese Communists have torn up all thirteen articles of the Beiping Armistice Agreement, which is also the Peace Agreement. We have long pointed out that what the people want is peace, not surrender; what the government should seek for the people is also peace, not surrender. The Chinese Communists have honestly stated that the "Beiping Model" of peace is "surrender." Does Shao Lizi want to stand in the position of the government representative and forcibly represent the people, saying that the people in the South are all willing to surrender unconditionally to the Chinese Communists? We would like to warn the He cabinet: it is acceptable to form a "peace cabinet," but it is not acceptable to be a "surrender cabinet!"</p>
<p>True peace is peace; false peace is surrender! Then, what is the difference between peace and surrender?</p>
<p>To recognize the true face of peace, we must at least have the following five points:</p>
<p>(1) National Independence. We want peace to build the country. The Republic of China is owned by all 400 million compatriots. We cannot allow our country to become a dependency of a power state for the sake of peace. If we are willing to bow our heads and become vassals within the iron curtain in a peaceful fantasy, then we can applaud the betrayal of the country by people like Wang Jingwei, who went to negotiate peace with the invading Japanese warlords, and there is no need to resist until the end. Therefore, if there is any place in the conditions for peace negotiations that harms the country's independent sovereignty, then it is not true peace.</p>
<p>(2) Territorial Integrity. Whether the territory of the Republic of China is complete; to change the territory of the country, legal procedures must be followed, otherwise it is unconstitutional and treasonous. As for dividing the country's territory and making it incomplete, it is also not allowed by the people. The country's political system can be changed according to the times, but the integrity of the country's territory must never be sacrificed under the smoke screen of peace.</p>
<p>(3) Political Democracy. What we want is direct democracy, that is, the implementation of full people's politics. We only regret that the Three Principles of the People have not been truly implemented before, but we do not want to change to another ideology. Moreover, the Chinese Communists also claim that the Three Principles of the People are necessary for China today and are willing to fight for them. Mao Zedong's followers are also saying that his "New Democracy" is the implementation of the Three Principles of the People. Then, we have the right to demand that all regions of the country seriously compete in political democracy. If secret agent politics are not only not changed but even strengthened, and the people's basic rights are not only not guaranteed but even further deprived, then it is further away from democracy and definitely not the result of peace that the people hope for.</p>
<p>(4) Economic Equality. Only with equality can there be harmony. Therefore, if peace cannot be built on the foundation of economic equality, the ivory tower of peace will also be shaky. The biggest shortcoming of the government's administration today is that it has not implemented the Principle of People's Livelihood, so that social wealth cannot achieve a considerable balance. Chinese society does not need communism, and it is not necessary to forcibly abolish the private property system, but it certainly cannot tolerate any form of unscrupulous exploitation by the powerful and wealthy, making the poor poorer and the rich richer, and plunging the entire society into a state of inequality and unrest. We advocate that the state use social policies to make the redistribution of social wealth reasonable, but we do not approve of using violence to conduct endless "liquidation" and "struggle," so that everyone perishes together under the blind slogan of "turning over," and everyone becomes "greatly impoverished." We hope that under the conditions of peace, the people will be guaranteed to live and work in peace and contentment under the principle of economic equality, and work hard in production and marketing.</p>
<p>(5) Freedom of Thought. The value of life lies not only in the enjoyment of material life but also in the free spiritual life. Because people have humanity, and humanity is endowed by heaven and is completely free. The Western philosopher said, "Man is born free," and the constitution refers to this. If a person does not have freedom of thought, then they lose the joy of life. "Give me liberty, or give me death" refers to freedom of thought, and freedom of speech, freedom of publication, freedom of the press, etc. all belong to it. What we the people firmly strive for is that the lifestyle of freedom of thought must be maintained. If the government, under the guise of peace, sells the basic human rights of freedom of thought of our people just to seek temporary peace, it is tantamount to buying a casket and returning the pearl, and what we will inevitably obtain is a false peace.</p>
<p>As is well known, the Chinese people have no extravagant hopes today, but seek national independence, territorial integrity, political democracy, economic equality, and freedom of thought. If these five points can be guaranteed, we are willing to see the country gain vitality in peace. The government should respond to the people's hopes, seize this opportunity, and openly and honestly ask the Chinese Communists to send representatives to start peace talks as soon as possible. The leaders of the Chinese Communists should also deeply appreciate the meaning of the people, abandon the illusion of believing in unification by force, and resolutely send representatives to discuss the conditions for peace based on these five principles. As for us, the people, we should not underestimate ourselves and only stand by and watch, letting the situation evolve naturally. We should seize this opportunity when the Communist army is preparing to cross the river and the flames of war have not yet been rekindled, unite our efforts and call out in unison, not allowing any party to fire a gun, not allowing any party to cross the river to fight, and waiting for peace negotiations. At present, the Yangtze River seems to be a natural boundary line of peace; whoever crosses this boundary line to attack is a war peddler who chants false peace!</p>
<h3>Eighth Session of the Hankou City Council Opens; Bai Chongxi Elaborates on Peace; It is Said That Peace Requires Paying a Price to Be Fair and Reasonable</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou, This Newspaper, 20th] The eighth session of the Hankou City Council opened on the morning of the 20th. Speaker Zhang Chuanchuan gave an opening speech, emphasizing "seeking unity internally and seeking peace externally" and listing stabilizing the economy and improving people's livelihood as the main topics of the meeting. Subsequently, General Commander Bai, Chairman Zhu, Mayor Yan, and others delivered speeches, frankly providing opinions on the current urgent matters.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou, This Newspaper, 20th] General Commander Bai attended the opening ceremony of the City Council in the spring rain on the 20th and delivered a speech. The council members listened with great interest. Bai reported that the sincerity in seeking peace is unanimously shared by the entire country, but peace does not come with a simple shout. A considerable price must be paid to strive for fair and reasonable peace. Some people now advocate stopping conscription and grain requisition to show sincerity for peace, which is not quite correct. Bai cited the historical facts that the three dynasties prospered because soldiers and farmers were one, and the Song dynasty perished because the conscription system was abolished. He repeatedly stated: "The conscription system is the best system to enrich national defense. Even if peace is achieved, there is no reason to abolish it. So-called being vigilant in times of peace and being prepared for danger. Now that there is no peace, conscription should not be stopped, let alone the Communist army is marching south step by step, and their military service movement is more strict and active than ours. How can we cut off our hands to seek peace?" At this point, Bai discussed the issue of reform in detail, believing that reform must first reform the heart. Everything cannot just be empty talk. We must recognize the world trend of solving people's livelihood and earnestly do things for the people. He said: After the He cabinet is formed, the future of reform and peace will become brighter.</p>
<h3>Suppression in the Border Areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei; Song Xilian Appointed Commander-in-Chief; He Shaozhou Appointed Commander-in-Chief of Suppression in the Border Areas of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guiyang, This Newspaper, 20th] Bandit spies often cause trouble in the border areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei. The central government has adopted the suggestions of the respective provinces and recently sent Song Xilian, commander of a certain army corps in Yichang, as the commander-in-chief of the joint defense and suppression of the four provinces, to eliminate the bandits in Yanhe, Daozhen, and other counties in northeastern Guizhou and Youyang, Xiushan, Qianjiang, Pengshui, and other counties in southeastern Sichuan as soon as possible. A headquarters has been established in Xiushan to be responsible for the suppression. In addition, the bandit forces in the border areas of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi are spreading. The authorities in Yunnan and Guizhou recommended He Shaozhou, commander of the Sixth Compilation and Training, as the commander-in-chief of the joint defense and suppression of the three provinces. He has transferred his subordinate Chen Yingsi's division to the Panjiang River basin in southwestern Guizhou to carry out the suppression.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Military Control District Sends Personnel to Various Districts to Supervise Conscription</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 20th] Only one-third of the conscription quota in Zhejiang Province has been completed so far.

<h3>Mo Xide Arrives in Guangzhou to Talk; Rumors of Rebellion in Chaoshan Are Groundless; Yu Yingqi Sits in Chao'an to Suppress Bandits; External Transportation in Shantou Has Not Been Interrupted</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, This Newspaper, 20th] Recently, rumors have spread that Yu Yingqi, Commander of Bandit Suppression in the Fujian-Guangdong Border Area, has rebelled, and that Zeng Juzhi and Mo Xide, Commanders of Bandit Suppression in the Fourth and Fifth Districts, have been detained by Yu. The Sui Jing'an Office spokesperson here has solemnly denied this, saying that this is obviously a rumor fabricated by traitors to try to sow discord. Zeng Juzhi, Commander of the Fourth District, who was rumored to have been detained, is currently recuperating in Guangzhou due to injuries sustained in the campaign. Mo Xide, Commander of the Fifth District, has arrived in Guangzhou from Shantou to report on his work. According to Mo, this news is completely unfounded. Commander Yu is still sitting in Chao'an to suppress bandits, and external transportation in Shantou has not been interrupted. How can there be rumors of rebellion? As for the navy opening Shantou, it is purely to welcome the British fleet and has no other mission. The bandit situation in Dongjiang is also not as serious as rumored. The 154th Division of the National Army is stepping up its encirclement and suppression of the bandits.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Accelerates Infiltration into Xinjiang; The Washington Star Publishes an Article Commenting on It</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 19th] The Washington Star published an article by Stoddard commenting on the Red Army's infiltration into Xinjiang and the intensification of control over China. Stoddard said: After the Communist Party's victory in China, regardless of what interests the Chinese Communist regime ultimately has for Moscow, Moscow will inevitably organize infiltration into the vast territories west of mainland China. Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet have limited natural resources, and their value to the Soviet Union is mostly strategic. Once they are obtained, they can control the entire heart of Asia and exert pressure on both China and India. The first stage of Soviet expansion occurred 25 years ago when the Communist Party turned Outer Mongolia into a "People's Republic" that obeyed Moscow. Now it is expanding to Inner Mongolia. At the same time, the Soviet Union is now accelerating its infiltration into Xinjiang. Although Xinjiang is remote, it can be infiltrated from China in the east and from other parts of Turkestan in the west. Xinjiang was an important link in the past for traveling caravans. China's effective control over Xinjiang began two centuries ago, but it has never "Sinicized" Xinjiang. Whether Muslims or non-Muslims, resettlement in Xinjiang has not been successful. Today, the Han Chinese in Xinjiang are almost only garrison troops, officials, and diners.</p>
<p>The rebellion that occurred five years ago has never been quelled, and the importance now lies in this kind of support, how much of which is officially backed by the Soviet Union. Western Turkestan has undergone drastic changes since the Bolshevik Revolution. This is indeed conducive to the Soviet Union's plans for Eastern Turkestan. At the same time, the Turks in Xinjiang have been discriminated against for years under the rule of the Tsars and Chinese masters. Today, Soviet propaganda still encounters strong opposition, because most of the Turks in Xinjiang are devout Muslims. Their conservative economic and social ideas are inherently resistant to communism. However, unfortunately, the incompetence of Chinese rule has angered the residents, causing them to lean towards the Soviet Union. The recent rebellion was obviously supported by the Soviet Union behind the scenes, and Moscow has once again gained a foothold at the door of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>In fact, there are various signs that the Chinese authorities are willing to reach an agreement with Moscow. Judging from the current situation, it is difficult to prevent the Soviet Union from taking whatever it wants, and Xinjiang will become a Soviet protectorate. The current rebel regime has formed its Turkestan "Republic." If Xinjiang is controlled by the Soviet Union, the consequences would be serious. First, China is already surrounded in the north by Soviet Mongolia, and now it will be surrounded by another Soviet satellite state, which will inevitably increase Soviet pressure on China. Secondly, after Xinjiang is controlled, Moscow will have a direct route from Kashmir to India. This remote mountainous plateau, the "roof of Asia," hangs over India and further surrounds China. Soviet infiltration into Xinjiang is difficult, but not impossible. Once the Soviet Union infiltrates Tibet, its control over the heart of Asia can be said to be complete.</p>
<h3>Masked Robbers in Hangzhou Apprehended</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 20th] Masked robbers have been repeatedly discovered in Hangzhou robbing property recently. The criminal police team solved the case on the evening of the 19th and arrested the masked robbers Xie Guozhen, Ge Xiangsheng, Xu Mengzhi, Lin Huaichun, and family member Chen Qiuxin, a total of five people, as well as three pistols and three bullets.

<h3>Serious Inflation in the Communist Area; Causing Complicated Problems Such as Exchange Rates, Prices, and Wages; Tianjin Branch of the "People's Bank" Offers Deposit in Kind</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City] The impact of inflation on the Chinese Communist Party can be proven by various signs. In the weeks after the fall of Beiping, favorable exchange rates could be obtained for remittances to Beiping. Namely, the gold yuan could be exchanged at par, and people's banknotes could be exchanged at a higher purchasing rate. However, remittances to Beiping were suddenly suspended last week, and the reason is not very clear, but it is rumored that the exchange rate has dropped sharply. A few days later, it was announced here that remittances could be handled by five designated banks, but these banks did not show enthusiastic interest in handling them. The reason is also not very clear. It is said that there is a lack of communication between the north and south branches, or that the financial authorities here are still indifferent to opening remittance business to cities in North China. Some bankers believe that the exchange rate between Beiping and Tianjin is so unfavorable that both the remitter and the recipient suffer losses. The authorities in North China may even try to implement an official exchange rate, which means freezing the currency value. When the gold yuan was issued last year, the Nationalist government tried to freeze it and failed. The Chinese Communist Party has undeniably experienced inflation, but until recently, it has been proven that the inflation of the people's banknotes has not been as severe as that of the gold yuan. However, until recently, the Chinese Communist Party did not cope with urban economies. The Chinese Communist Party's rural economy is not overly reliant on currency. The Chinese Communist Party has not engaged in the management and support of large cities in the past. Now it must take on this responsibility, thus falling into the same inflationary trap as the Nationalist government. The Communist currency is also not fully prepared, so it cannot avoid inflation, which leads to the same complicated problems of exchange rates, price controls, and wage indices. It is said that one of the reasons why the Communist Party is concealing the news of Beiping and Tianjin is this.</p>

<h3>Historical Facts of the Chongqing Warship</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Chongqing warship was completed in 1937. It was a battlecruiser weighing 7,000 tons, with a length of 505 feet and a width of 51 feet. It had six 6-inch armored main guns, mounted in three turrets and electrically controlled. It also possessed eight 4-inch secondary guns, capable of both anti-aircraft and surface fire, mounted in four turrets; eight anti-aircraft machine guns; one 6-inch gun command station; and two 4-inch gun command stations, all equipped with command instruments to enable concentrated fire. There were also six 21-inch torpedo launchers, mounted on the port and starboard sides. Depth charges were launched from the stern. It had two sets of anti-submarine paravanes and a magnetic mine defense grid, as well as four sets of radar, one for air surveillance, one for surface surveillance, and the remaining two for air and surface combat. Its horsepower was 64,000, with a maximum speed of 30 nautical miles per hour and a range of 4,000 nautical miles.</p>
<p>The ship was originally named the Aurora. During World War II, it first served as a North Sea escort, then participated in the sinking of the German battleship Bismarck, and later was transferred to the Mediterranean to participate in the North African landings, specifically targeting the Italian fleet. It sank as many as 16 Italian transport ships. The most glorious and world-renowned battle feat of the ship was its encounter with an Italian cruiser armed with eight 8-inch guns. Despite being weaker in firepower, it fought bravely and ultimately forced the Italian ship to retreat, damaged. Due to this glorious achievement, the ship was given the endearing nickname "Silver Ghost" at the time. In June 1943, during a very tense period of the European war, the British King sailed on the ship to Malta to inspect the defending troops.</p>
<p>After the end of the war, Britain gifted the ship to China and assisted us in training our navy. At the end of 1946, more than 600 Chinese naval officers and students went to Portsmouth and served as junior officers and ordinary soldiers in the British Navy, receiving training for more than a year. On May 19, 1948, the ship and the "Lingfu" warship were formally handed over to our side. A solemn and simple ship presentation ceremony was held at noon that day in Portsmouth Harbour, presided over by Admiral Fraser, Commander-in-Chief of Portsmouth Harbour. Ambassador Zheng Tianxi, our ambassador to the UK, represented China in receiving the ship.</p>
<p>On May 26, the ship, commanded by Captain Deng Zhaoxiang, sailed back to China with the fully trained officers and men, arriving in Nanjing in mid-August. In early September, after arriving in Shanghai to replenish supplies, just as the war in the Northeast was tense, the ship escorted President Chiang to Yingkou and Huludao to direct operations. When the Northeast fell, it covered the retreat of the 52nd Army in Huludao, and also sank many Communist ships sailing from Dalian to Yantai in the Bohai Sea.</p>
<p>The Chongqing warship's disadvantage was its enormous consumption. During combat, it consumed about 100 tons of oil per day, and even when docked, it required more than 10 tons of diesel per day. It is said that the daily expenses of the ship were no less than the value of a regular army brigade.</p>

<h3>In Response to the North Atlantic Treaty, the Soviet Union Will Take Countermeasures. East Germany Holds Military Exercises Early</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 20th] According to authoritative sources in the "Sunday Express" this morning, it is believed that the Soviet Union's response to the government's Atlantic Pact will be to take large-scale measures soon. These measures may include the following: (1) The Soviet Union will announce an early Eastern European Defense Treaty, uniting all Eastern European countries under the banner of the Soviet Union to confront the West.

<p>[Reuters Washington, 19th] The State Department today released a pamphlet entitled "Collective Defense of the North Atlantic Region and the Maintenance of Peace, Security, and Freedom." It said that the signing of the Atlantic Pact could have a corrective effect on the precarious world security situation.

This pact can show the consequences of warmongering, so it can enable international problems to be resolved peacefully. Since the signing of the UN Charter, Soviet leaders have misinterpreted Western civilization a lot. If the United Nations and the United States can eliminate these misinterpretations, they will make great contributions to world peace.</p>

After the association resumes business, in addition to the 56 member companies that have resumed business, all original old members of the association can continue to apply for resumption of business without any time limit.</p>
<p>The full text of the more than ten articles of the method of trading spot gold and the number plate names of the resuming members of the association will be announced after the association files with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs this morning. However, according to reporters' inquiries, after the association resumes market trading, the trading objects will still be limited to gold, and will not include silver and silver dollars. The market hours are from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM every day, except on holidays, and from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The unit and fineness of the transaction will be based on the ten-tael factory bar issued by the Central Bank. After the resumption of market trading, each member company can send two representatives to the market to negotiate transactions. The market will be temporarily located in the hall of the association's address at No. 4, Lane 43, North Wuxi Road. When reporters visited the association yesterday, they saw that the accumulated goods in the hall had been cleared, and the craftsmen were rushing to build the various market facilities overnight. One hundred pairs of intercom telephones are also expected to be installed tomorrow.</p>
<p>The association has now sent notes to various competent authorities, including the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Management Bureau, the Central Bank, and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, inviting them to send personnel to attend and guide when the association officially resumes market trading at 10:00 AM on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>800,000 Silver Coins Delivered to the National Bank for the Market. The Mint Produces 110,000 to 120,000 Coins Per Day</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The silver coin printing machines of the Central Mint have been installed with four units, and the remaining one can be completed within a few days. Once all five machines are installed, they can start working day and night. Currently, only single-day work is still being done, and each printing machine produces 30,000 silver dollars per day, about 110,000 to 120,000 per day. Because the Central Bank urgently needs to put new silver dollars on the market, they are delivered as they are produced. As of yesterday, a total of 800,000 coins have been delivered to the National Bank. After the five printing machines start working day and night, they can produce 300,000 silver dollars per day and night.</p>
<h3>Cash Panic Can Be Resolved. The National Bank Will Supply as Much as Possible Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Regarding the cash panic in this city, according to a spokesperson for the Central Bank who spoke to reporters yesterday, it will be gradually improved starting today. The National Bank will supply an adequate amount of 500-yuan notes as much as possible starting today, so as to meet the needs of all sectors. As for rumors that 1,000-yuan notes will be released in large quantities, the spokesperson was unwilling to make a definite statement, only saying that in principle, 1,000-yuan notes are still mainly supplied to other cities, because their volume and weight are smaller, making them easier for large-amount transportation. As for this city, if an adequate amount of 500-yuan notes are issued, it will be enough to meet the needs. In addition, the large-scale payment of salaries by state-owned and private enterprises has mostly been completed before the 20th, so the need for a large amount of cash has decreased. If the cash can maintain a regular supply, the cash panic will be completely eliminated within a week.</p>

<h3>Serial Piracy on Sea Vessels; Two Robbers Each Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In a case of banditry transferred by the Special Criminal Court to the District Court, Judge Xie Zhiying of the court pronounced the sentence the day before yesterday: Defendants Gu Jinshan and Shi Caiqi, jointly committing serial piracy on the ocean, each sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. The two defendants were boatmen by trade. On June 5th of last year, together with Lu Quan (who was killed) and Cai Hongxiang, who is still at large, they sailed to the vicinity of Xiaohe off the Wusong estuary to commit robbery. At approximately 3:00 PM that afternoon, a Ningbo fishing boat appeared on the sea surface. Lu Quan immediately used a short gun to order the fishing boat to stop, and led the group onto the boat, robbing three rifles and one pistol. The next evening, while the Gu group was anchored at Bei Xiaohe, they saw a painted boat approaching, intending to harbor for the night. When the ship approached the bandit boat, Lu again led the group on board and forcibly robbed the painted boat. Gu and Shi then transported the stolen goods to Wusong for sale. They were apprehended by the Gaoqiao Police Precinct, which recovered the stolen goods and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The case was then transferred to the Special Criminal Court. With the closure of that court, the case was returned to the District Court for the above judgment.</p>
<p>A Thousand Gold Misses Round Out a Fine Gentleman - Chen Huiling</p>
<h3>More Than Forty Officers and Soldiers of the Chongqing Warship Left Behind in Shanghai, Arranged for Separate Accommodation; Deputy Captain Mou's Opinion on the Significance of Deliberate Destruction Is the Rectification of Military Discipline</h3>
<p>[Our Report] When the cruiser Chongqing sailed to the Bohai Sea without orders, there were a total of 587 officers and soldiers on board. There were 44 officers and soldiers, including Deputy Captain Mou Bingjian, who were ashore on official business. When they returned to the ship after completing their duties, they discovered that the Chongqing had quietly sailed north. Currently, these more than forty officers and soldiers have been separately accommodated by Deputy Captain Mou. Mou himself will also report to the Naval Headquarters for duty on the first of next month.</p>
<p>According to Mou: When the Chongqing was transferred from the Jiangnan Shipyard to anchor at the Wusong estuary, the situation at the time was turbulent, so it maintained mobility, and the fuel supply was sufficient to cope with all contingencies. The reason for its departure is a mystery. Warships are different from airplanes; even if a few people had dissenting opinions, they could not force the ship to sail north. The only explanation is that the captain received forged orders and sailed north on his own initiative. The captain's authority at sea is supreme; once an order is issued, no one dares to object. However, given Captain Deng's personality, he is an extremely law-abiding person, and it seems unlikely that he would take such a drastic action. The truth will not be known until officers and soldiers from the ship return. From a military point of view, none of the seaports in North and Northeast China, except for Lushun and Dalian, can provide a place for this giant ship to dock and repair. Although Dagu has facilities, it can only be used for small ships and cannot repair the Chongqing. Regular repair work is indispensable for any type of ship. If it cannot dock in Lushun and Dalian, the Chongqing, even if it does not return south, will become unusable after six months in the Bohai Sea due to the lack of maintenance facilities. At the same time, the CCP has no military value in acquiring this giant ship, because the ship's personnel are insufficient, and there are not enough to allocate for duty. Among the 44 officers and soldiers remaining in Shanghai, 14 are skilled in managing the engines. Therefore, from a technical point of view, even though this ship is in the hands of the CCP, it will not immediately pose a significant threat here. The authorities' current decision to destroy it by the air force probably contains the meaning of rectifying military discipline. Deputy Captain Mou went to Nanjing on official business on the 22nd of last month, and the Chongqing had already sailed away by the time he returned to Shanghai. Mou is very fortunate that he was not involved in this incident, but his important belongings were lost with the northward voyage of this giant ship. Due to the unrest at the time, naval personnel placed their important belongings on the ship to prevent accidents. Unexpectedly, Shanghai was peaceful, but the warship itself was the first to have problems.</p>
<p>Cadet Captain Lu Dongge's Elderly Mother, Wife, and Children Are All in Shanghai</p>
<p>In addition, Colonel Lu Dongge, the Chief of the Naval Headquarters, who was stationed on the Chongqing as a cadet, also sailed north with the ship and has not been heard from since. His wife, Song Lixia, is currently caring for his seventy-year-old mother and raising his ten-month-old son, residing in the naval officers' dormitory here. There are also two nephews of Colonel Lu who fled from North China and are also being supported by her, living a very difficult life. Mrs. Song told reporters yesterday that her husband was serving as a cadet captain on the Chongqing, equivalent to a guest, and had no real command authority. The rumors that he was responsible for command and combat were a misunderstanding. The dependents of the Chongqing's officers and soldiers are now scattered in various places, and there are also some in this city. Currently, the Naval Headquarters is still issuing the salaries and rice rations to each person to maintain the livelihood of their families.</p>

<h3>Pork Prices Rise Sharply, Sales Decrease Significantly</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Pork prices have risen sharply in recent days. Yesterday, the retail price on the market was 3,400 yuan per catty for leg meat, 3,600 yuan for ribs, and 3,000 yuan for spare ribs.

<h3>Sanmao Paradise Association to Raise Funds on April 4th</h3>
<p>[Our Report] "Sanmao" is a character created by cartoonist Zhang Leping, depicting a child who becomes a homeless wanderer, living a life of hardship and enduring all kinds of cruel treatment. Even today, there are countless unfortunate children in society who are experiencing the same plight as Sanmao, struggling to live in hunger and wind and rain, enduring cruelty and not enjoying the warmth of human kindness. To this end, the China Welfare Fund, chaired by Madame Sun Yat-sen Soong Ching Ling, is organizing a permanent "Sanmao Paradise Association" and will begin recruiting members on Children's Day, April 4th. The association will also hold a Sanmao book exhibition at the Dazhong Company on the fourth floor starting on that day, as well as exhibiting the association's child welfare work and photos and charts of Yucai School founded by Tao Xingzhi, to raise funds for child welfare. The funds and supplies raised will be used for the education and medical expenses of these children.</p>
<h3>Soochow University Law School Holds Exhibition of Legal Codes, Books, and Cultural Relics</h3>

<h3>Silver Dollar Vendors Concentrated; Reality Not Yet Seen; Fraudulent Acts Occur Frequently; Management Truly Needs to Be Strengthened</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The authorities recently announced the implementation of management measures for silver dollar vendors, and designated seventeen business locations, stipulating centralized operations. However, several days have passed, and this has not yet been formally achieved. In the past week, the number of people engaged in silver dollar trading has increased daily. Those who previously traded as street vendors have also joined the ranks of silver dollar trading. It is estimated that at least 20,000 people now depend on this trade for their livelihood. These people have no fixed organization, and their current distribution is purely based on convenient transportation, areas with a concentration of middle and lower-class families, and places with more ordinary stores, so that they can easily maintain contact with general salary earners or store employees. If they are forced to relocate to centralized business locations, they will strongly oppose it because of fewer trading opportunities, so implementation will be difficult. The police bureau is currently conducting surprise arrests of silver dollar vendors, but the reason is to crack down on their obstruction of traffic or disruption of order. In fact, the silver dollar vendors are a diverse group, and fraudulent acts against customers occur daily, such as selling silver dollars made with copper pieces sandwiched in silver shells, or inserting small denominations into large bills to misrepresent the total amount paid, causing frequent disputes between buyers and sellers. To improve this, the authorities must quickly devise measures to strengthen management. Before the establishment of a gold and silver market, silver dollar vendors are at least a way for general salary earners to mutually exchange goods and maintain the value of currency. If managed properly, the general public and both buyers and sellers can hope to gain some security in their economic lives. In addition to silver dollar vendors, many tobacco and paper shops near the central district have also begun to engage in silver dollar trading, and are posting daily buy and sell prices, a situation that easily reminds people of the situation fifteen years ago when silver coins were exchanged for copper coins.</p>
<h3>Luxurious Train Returns to Simplicity; Air Conditioning Removed, Resumes Operation on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The air-conditioned express train that caused a sensation in the national railway industry in late summer last year, operated on the Nanjing-Shanghai line for less than half a year after leaving the factory, before encountering the great chaos caused by the government's relocation to the south and extensive military transport. The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Bureau greatly valued this streamlined, air-conditioned train and immediately stopped its operation, sending it to the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory for "refuge." Therefore, the express train did not suffer any damage during the "great chaos." The railway bureau believes that such a luxurious and perfect train is not needed during this period. To adapt to the environment, it is now planning to replace the original double-sealed windows of the train with movable windows that can be opened and closed freely, and the air conditioning equipment will also be removed. The color scheme of the carriages, designed by a professor of fine arts from National Central University, will also be completely painted over and repainted in a uniform dark green to match other first-class carriages. The reclining seats in the carriages will remain. In short, efforts will be made to remove the "aristocratic" aura from this aristocratic train. Once the modification is completed, it can resume operation on the Nanjing-Shanghai line.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Police Precinct Chief Sun Keqiang Detained; Accused of Embezzlement, Dereliction of Duty, and Other Verified Crimes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhabei Precinct Chief Sun Keqiang has recently been accused of embezzlement, dereliction of duty, and harboring criminals. After Director Mao approved the dispatch of personnel from the Inspectorate to investigate and verify the allegations, he ordered Sun to be detained yesterday afternoon and handed over to the Criminal Division for investigation. Sun originally served as the Gaoqiao Precinct Chief, and was then transferred to the Jiangwan Precinct Chief. After less than half a year, he was transferred to the Zhabei Precinct Chief, where he has remained until now. According to reliable sources, Sun Keqiang is involved in a major case in addition to the charges of embezzlement and dereliction of duty, and the circumstances are serious. After taking over as Director of the Police Bureau, Mao is determined to eradicate corruption and will thoroughly investigate this case and punish it according to law.</p>
<h3>Hengya Bookstore Employee Commits Another Crime Soon After Being Released From Prison; Gu Guozhen Robs a Female Customer With Accomplices; Sentenced to Ten Years and Six Months of Imprisonment; Other Two Accomplices Each Sentenced to Seven Years</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Gu Guozhen, also known as Gu Miaogen, an employee of the Hengya Bookstore in this city, was previously sentenced to eight months in prison for fraud. Shortly after being released from prison in July of last year, he became an employee of the Hengya Bookstore. On the evening of the eighth of last month, he saw a female customer, Xu Huifang, wearing a diamond ring that shone brightly, and he had bad intentions. Knowing that his colleague Yao Wenqiao was acquainted with the woman, he invited Yao and other friends, Liang Guocheng and Chen Xiangdang, who is still at large, to follow the woman to her residence at 221 Beihai Road when she left the bookstore. Gu handed a pistol purchased by Wang Guangtuo to Liang Guocheng and they, along with Chen Xiangdang, entered the residence to commit robbery. Gu stayed outside to watch for any signs of trouble, closed the curtains, and used the gun to threaten silence. They robbed the female customer Xu Huifang of a diamond ring she was wearing, as well as two diamond rings sent by Ding Liufulian. They then returned to the Hengya Bookstore and entrusted Gu Guozhen to sell or hide the stolen goods. After receiving the report, the police suspected that Gu's wife, Ni Caizhen, and Gu's friend, Zhang Yunpeng, were also accomplices, and arrested them together. They were transferred to the District Court for trial. The day before yesterday, Judge Xie Zhiying of the District Court pronounced the sentence: Gu Guozhen, Liang Guocheng, and Yao Wenqiao jointly committed robbery. Gu Guozhen, as a repeat offender, was sentenced to ten years and six months of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights. Liang and Yao were each sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights. Zhang Yunpeng and Ni Caizhen were both found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Pretending to Check Household Registration, Three Robbers Plundered Away Satisfied</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At 10:30 PM the night before last, three robbers suddenly knocked on the door of Xing Zemin's home at No. 33, Lane 142, Xiangyang South Road. Each of them produced firearms and claimed to be personnel from the Garrison Command and the Police Bureau, requesting to check the household registration. One of them was wearing a uniform and claimed to be a policeman. They immediately began searching, and as a result, a gold necklace weighing three taels, two diamond rings, four gold rings, two taels of gold, a gold chain weighing two taels and two qian, a woman's watch, and sixty-five silver dollars were robbed. Afterwards, the victim provided a list of lost items and reported it to the relevant police precinct for investigation.</p>
<h3>Five Suspicious Individuals Arrested for Carrying Weapons and Gambling Tools</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At approximately 5:00 AM yesterday morning, patrolman Fu Jie of the Dongjiadu Police Station of the Penglai Police Precinct led two policemen on patrol to the intersection of Lujiabang Road and Nancang Street. In the darkness, they discovered five men gathered there. The policemen shone a flashlight on them and saw that they were all wearing uniforms, holding mahjong tiles and other gambling tools, and looked flustered and suspicious. For caution's sake, patrolman Fu first sent a policeman back to the station to inform the 4th Inspection Team of the nearby Garrison Command. Captain Wang of the team then dispatched a team of soldiers to arrest the five men. On the spot, they confiscated a bayonet, a hand grenade, a pistol, and a set of mahjong tiles and pai gow tiles. After taking them back for interrogation, they identified themselves as Qian Baolong, Shi Yongshan, Gu Ping, and Zeng Xianwei. Another man refused to reveal his name. As for why Shen Yi was wandering the streets, they were all evasive. Captain Wang, suspicious of the situation, transferred them to the Garrison Command for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Using a Prostitute As Cover For Haircut, Swindling A Watch, And Fleeing Far Away; Two Apprentices Unknowingly Fall For The Trap</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At approximately 11:00 AM yesterday, two young customers, a man and a woman, suddenly came to the Chunfeng Barber Shop at No. 706, Yunnan Road, Zhongzheng Middle Road. The man, who appeared to be in his twenties, was dressed in a Western suit, while the woman, who appeared to be in her early twenties, was dressed plainly. The owner, Gu Jinwen, cordially welcomed them. The woman sat down for a shampoo, and the man, after a brief combing, told the owner that it was raining heavily and asked if he could send an apprentice to fetch a raincoat with him. Gu then instructed apprentice Dong Yijiang to go with him. When they arrived at the intersection of Xizang South Road and Jinling Road, the customer entered the Yitaixiang Watch Shop. Dong followed him inside. The customer selected a "Guaitike" watch, priced at 80,000 yuan, and said that he did not have enough cash and asked if he could pay with silver dollars instead. After the shop assistant calculated the equivalent, it should be eleven silver dollars. He then asked if he could send an apprentice to fetch the silver. The shop, suspecting nothing, sent apprentice Shen Weimin (a local 18-year-old) with the watch. When they arrived at the corner of the Great World, the customer said to Shen, "You can give me this watch. You can get the silver dollars from Dong when you return to the shop." He then said to Dong, "After you go back, get twelve silver dollars from the madam (referring to the female customer who was getting a shampoo) and give it to him." Shen, who had just come to Shanghai from the countryside, fell for the trick and let him take the watch. After Liang, the apprentice, arrived at the barber shop, he told the truth. Only then did they realize they had been deceived. At this time, the girl who came with him was still getting her hair combed. When questioned, she said, "I am a prostitute, living at No. 14, Fuchang Lane, across the street. Last night, I met this young man and stayed with him for the night. This morning at 10:00, he invited me here to get a shampoo. I really didn't know he was a swindler." After speaking, she had to pay for the shampoo herself and quickly left. Shen Weimin, the apprentice from Yitaixiang, immediately returned to the shop and reported the details of the scam.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Success in Testing Economical Smokeless Stove</h3>
<p>It is reported that Gu Yuquan, former director of the Central Industrial Experiment Institute, and Chen Xuejun, director of the thermal engineering laboratory of the institute, have jointly designed a type of "economical smokeless stove," and the testing has achieved preliminary success. The economical smokeless stove can burn bituminous coal. During combustion, it is not only clean and smokeless, and economical in fuel, but also designed to utilize waste heat to reduce heat loss. The combustion efficiency of the stove is very high. In addition to the performance of a general stove, it also has the advantages of heating water, drying items, and keeping vegetables warm. It will greatly improve the use of existing household stoves.</p>

<h3>Hua Lian in a Thrilling Match: Three Points Defeat Mai Ling, Li Team and Xinghua Tie, Veteran Donghua Team Defeats Mao Xun</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In yesterday evening's basketball league, both the men's and women's groups featured tense and exciting moments. Although Hua Lian defeated Mai Lings with a score of 38 to 32, the situation remained thrilling throughout the 40 minutes, with no moment of stability. In the first half, they looked down on them at 14, leading by only one point. In the women's group, the Xinghua and Li teams battled to a 39-39 tie, each earning one point. In another match, Donghua defeated Mao Xun with a score of 45 to 32.</p>
<p>In the featured match, Hua Lian fielded Fu Jinsheng, Bao Songyuan, Liu Fushan, Wu Chengzhang, and Li Zhenzhong to face off against Mai Lings, who started with Lis, Gao Laifu, Fulaote, Qiaokesheng, and O'Engai. After four minutes of intense play, Mai Ling's O'Engai scored one point due to a foul by Lao Bao. O scored again. Fu Shan's mistake in missing an opportunity and Lao Bao's poor ball handling nearly allowed Lis to score four points under the basket. Amidst the atmosphere, Liu of Hua Lian scored one point on a free throw, and Chengzhang pushed in another ball. Suddenly, Lis became rampant again, stunning Hua Lian. Songyuan managed to add a ball, making it 6 to 5, still one point behind. A Fu missed a free throw and two more shots, causing an uproar. After Mai Ling's Laimusai replaced O'Engai, he scored a point, establishing a balance, from 7-7 to 9-9. Mai Ling's Buleimao replaced Fulaote. Jinsheng scored a clean shot, making it 11-9. Mai Ling gradually felt the pressure, even their usual sharp shooters failing to score at all, highlighting their abnormal performance in shooting. In this state, Hua Lian's panic yielded no results.</p>
<p>Gao Fo Lai and Qiao Kesheng each scored a point, and Lao Bao showed his skill, allowing Hua Lian to barely win the first half 14-13, leading by one point.</p>
<p>In the second half, Jia Zhou replaced Jin Sheng. Their team captain, Lis, remained fierce, scoring a goal immediately upon entering the field. Wu and Le each scored one point on free throws, and Da Li pushed in a point. Gao Fo Lai, Chengzhang, Qiao Kesheng, and Ge You showed signs of strength. Songyuan often found it difficult to score. Lis's throw succeeded, making it 22-21, with Hua Lian only slightly ahead. Lao Bao's two free throws made up for his mistakes. Zhenzhong shot from afar, and Xiao Le followed up, slightly increasing their momentum. Unexpectedly, the situation changed drastically in the last three minutes, with Mai Ling scoring two consecutive goals, making it 36-32. Hua Lian dared not relax. At the end of the 40 minutes, the score was 38-32, with Mai Lings ultimately defeated.</p>

<p>Dong Mao Battle</p>
<p>In the Group A2 match, Donghua faced Mao Xun. The competition between these two teams was akin to a championship game for their group. The five players Donghua fielded had histories spanning over ten years. Chen Xianglong, Cai Yanxiong, Zhou Dayun, and Jia Youliang were all renowned players of the past. Xianglong, already in his forties, was particularly deserving of the title of veteran. In the initial exchanges, they were tied at three, before Donghua took the lead. After ten minutes, they were tied again at nine. Donghua replaced Cai and Zhou with Li Yao and Han Longhai. Comparatively, Mao Xun was at a disadvantage in terms of physique. Donghua's playing style was "strong against the weak, weak against the strong." Understanding both oneself and the opponent would have been the best strategy. Donghua scored eighteen in the first half, while Mao Xun scored half that.</p>
<p>A Cai replaced Longhai, and Dayun adjusted Youliang. This was Donghua's lineup in the second half. There were many humorous moments during the match, but Mao Xun struggled throughout, unable to break out of their dismal situation. Ultimately, the score was 45-33.</p>

<p>Star Li Battle</p>
<p>In the women's group match between Xinghua and Li, Xinghua initially scored five consecutive points. Li's team then began to score. In the first quarter, Xinghua scored ten points, while Li's team scored four. In the second quarter, Xinghua's two forwards became increasingly active. Their center, Wang Shan, was tall, standing out like a crane among chickens. Qian Mengyue's turnaround shots were also impressive. Li's Qian sisters and Yao Silian desperately chased after them. In the first half, Xinghua scored 24, while Li's team scored 16.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, the situation was balanced, with both sides attacking from both the left and right. Li's team was particularly formidable, surprising Xinghua. Zhu Lanzhen fouled out five times, and Wang Ruyu replaced her. The score became even closer. Qian Youping scored a goal, making it 29-28, taking the lead. Mengyue scored for Xinghua, making two consecutive shots in the free throw area. In the third quarter, the score was 32-29, with Xinghua still leading by three points. In the final quarter, both teams fought for every point. Xinghua's forwards made several passing plays. Wang Zhelun's push shots also had their merits. The opponent's two Qians and Yao Silian once closed the gap to half a point. Xinghua's consecutive free throws eased the pressure somewhat. In the last minute, Chu Ping made three of four free throws, tying the score at 39. In the end, Xinghua's Zhelun missed both free throws, and time ran out.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Tactics</h3>
<p>— Translated and Narrated by Qi Gong</p>
<p>When these tactics are actually applied, the defensive formation in (Diagram) can be transformed into the defensive formation in (Diagram Eight). The defenders should act according to their own judgment, depending on the changes in the situation. The deployment is like (Diagram), but when applied, it becomes the dynamic state of (Diagram Eight).</p>
<p>At the same time, it can be transformed into the formation in (Diagram Nine). The formation in (Diagram Four) can be transformed into the formation in (Diagram Ten) when applied.</p>
<p>In addition to the method of responding to the center circle kickoff, the other three formations (Diagrams Five, Six, and Seven) of the four mobile zone formations are sure to be effective if they can be applied skillfully.</p>
<p>The curved black lines in each diagram indicate the route that the defender must leave their original position and run, after the attacker gains possession of the ball. The basketball has been passed into her zone, and she has the responsibility of guarding the ball and the ball carrier.</p>
<p>Defenders must maintain a uniform distance and connection when defending. If the position of the center defender is too close to the other two defenders, there will be fewer opportunities to intercept the opponent's passes, and instead give the attacker the opportunity to dodge and enter. The result is that two defenders are guarding one attacker, leaving gaps in other areas, and the defender in that area has to guard two attackers alone, which is an excessive burden.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can be reminded from the above that defenders often make the above and the following simple mistakes when adopting a zone defense, causing the entire defense to collapse and failing to produce a defensive effect. The following are common mistakes that defenders tend to make when adopting a zone defense.</p>
<p>(1) After attacker A has passed the ball to attacker B, the defender guarding attacker A still follows attacker A, which is tantamount to adopting a man-to-man defense.</p>
<p>(2) The defender does not focus their eyes on the ball when defending, so they often fail to develop a sense of anticipation and cannot achieve the expected effect of intercepting the opponent's passes.</p>
<p>(3) When moving to defend, the distance is too far, and another area is exposed with gaps. If the attacker suddenly changes to attacking in the opposite area, the defender will inevitably be too late to traverse the court to cover and hinder the attack in that area.</p>
<p>(4) Moving too early – anticipating and judging incorrectly, assuming that the attacker is about to receive a pass from another attacker, the defender rushes forward too early, giving another area the opportunity to break in.</p>
<p>(5) Continuously retreating backwards during movement is tantamount to gradually allowing the attacker to approach and get into a shooting position. The main strategy of a zone defense is to keep the attacker out of easy shooting range, that is, outside the keyhole line. If the defender retreats continuously, they are unconsciously giving the attacker a favorable shooting position.</p>
<p>These are the most common mistakes that beginners make, causing the zone defense to lose all effect. It must also be remembered that if the opponent's attacker is skilled in long-range shooting, then the area defended by the defender should be expanded to the center line.</p>
<p>(6) After each pass by the attacker, the defender still does not move, not moving at all or only moving a few inches. This still will not get the opportunity to intercept the opponent's pass. (To be continued... 6)</p>

<h3>"Delightful" Collection</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>In this day and age, one should think of everything from the "good" side.</p>
<p>For example, hyperinflation certainly hinders the national economy; however, counterfeiters are deterred and disappear, which is a sign of improved national morality. Delightful one!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the train fare is too expensive, and the common people feel that they cannot afford it, and it is inevitable that there will be complaints, but the benefits seem to be even greater:</p>
<p>The order of getting on and off the train has been greatly improved, and there is no more rushing;</p>
<p>Everyone has a seat in the carriage, and they treat each other with respect, and no longer push and squeeze each other;</p>
<p>The driver must stop at each station, and no longer swear at the passengers;</p>
<p>All of these new and good customs that are pleasing to both Chinese and foreign observers can be fully expressed in a short period of time, all thanks to the increase in train fares.</p>
<p>Also: the common people are now able to walk to work, which is in line with the purpose of thrift and health. Delightful two!</p>
<p>Cigarettes are too expensive, and even low-level civil servants can no longer afford them, and they all complain. Who knows that the New Life Movement has not been promoted? People who have quit smoking hundreds of times can now have their wishes fulfilled. Delightful three!</p>
<p>Economic bankruptcy and financial chaos are naturally headaches for people, but there is at least one benefit: economic knowledge such as "cost of living", "money is loose but cash is scarce", and "good money drives out bad money"... has become universally known to the public, and even middle school students know the ins and outs of terms such as "call loan rate", "discount rate", and "rediscount rate". Economic problems that were difficult to explain in the classroom in the past are now no longer a problem. If this continues, everyone will have an economic mind and a talent for business. Why should the country not be rich? Delightful four!</p>
<p>Tuition fees are too high, and everyone says that they hinder the future of education; however, because tuition fees are high and education is difficult, it is enough to make every student in school be vigilant at all times and deeply understand the need to work hard and study hard. Student movements will naturally disappear without a trace, which will greatly benefit the future of education, and there will be many talents who become famous through hard study in the future. Delightful five!</p>
<p>In this day and age, one should think of everything from the "bright side" and look into the distance, and there is nothing that does not make people feel optimistic! Believe it or not.</p>
<h3>Clock</h3>
<p>— Yi Shi</p>
<p>You might wonder, what did people use to tell time before the clock was invented?</p>
<p>Thousands of years ago in Egypt, there was a kind of timer, which was a bronze bowl with a small hole in the bottom. When the sun rose, the bowl was floated on the water next to the thoroughfare. Water slowly flowed into the bowl from the hole, and when the water was full, a watchman would strike a gong to indicate that a fixed length of time had passed. When the second bowl was full, he would strike it twice, and so on until the evening. In England, a candle engraved into twelve equal sections was also used to tell time. Six candles were needed to burn out completely in one day and one night, with every three sections being roughly equal to one hour today. The ancient Chinese used clepsydras to tell time, but they were neither accurate nor labor-saving and expensive.</p>
<p>It was not until 1609 AD that Italian scientist Lelio invented the clock using the relationship between the mainspring and gears. This was a major revolution, which was not only accurate and cost-effective, but also sturdy and durable, so it was immediately adopted by the world. However, clock time is not completely accurate due to the influence of geomagnetism and temperature. With continuous improvement, the invention of the atomic clock recently completed a further contribution, with only one second difference every three million years, approaching absolute accuracy.</p>

<h3>Confession of a Recluse</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ming</p>
<p>Having lived in seclusion for a long time, my spirit has also been lazy for a long time. When dressing up for seclusion, I thought of taking advantage of this long day of leisure to write a lot of articles. I had drafted some topics, made some plans, but in the end, nothing came of it. Months passed by aimlessly. But that's nothing, because there is nothing in the world, so why bother myself? As for the plans, they were just a joke. The more detailed the plans, the less the results will be. How often have I seen anyone implement according to plan, step by step? So, it is not surprising that I lived aimlessly.</p>
<p>Recently, I ended my life of seclusion and moved to a new environment, and I have a new feeling about everything. When I sit quietly and feel bored, I really want to write something. I remember that my friend Mr. Zhu Zhu had these words in the preface of his collection of poems: "If writing a few articles can make my wife praise them, I would feel very honored; as for being recited by ten thousand people, making the paper in Luoyang expensive, and passing them on to future generations and storing them in famous mountains, I have always regarded these words as myths." This is my state of mind when it comes to writing articles. Moreover, I also think that articles should not be written too well; if they are written too well, the impression they give to others is just that you are a writer, so all the jobs of being an official and getting rich will not fall on you. What they can find you for is just to ask you to write an article. Think about how sad this is?</p>
<p>The interest of being successful is strong, and the interest of being a recluse is faint. It can also be said that success is a kind of dynamic interest, and seclusion is a kind of static interest. I lived in seclusion for a long time this year. I wanted to say "when the stillness reaches its extreme, one thinks of movement," but I just didn't want to move when the stillness reached its extreme. Recently, I moved to this ten-mile foreign market, not because I wanted to move myself, but because others wanted me to move. What is strange is that this movement made me quiet down. At home, there are still friends' gatherings and relatives' visits, but now I live in this area, as if I am living in seclusion in the mountains and forests. The writing room is very large, but there are only three "writers" in total, each occupying a corner. The work is easy, and they sit silently all day long. When I enter the door, I practice sitting meditation first. I have had this kind of experience of eating writing room food before, so I am naturally not surprised. It's just that after 6:00 PM every day, the two friends in the same room have other places to go, and I am often alone in the room, which is a bit terrifying.</p>
<p>After sitting quietly and feeling bored, I also thought of moving. This movement is very simple, which is to stand up and walk around. In the writing room, wandering back and forth, continuous rotation, often walking for half an hour, or even more than an hour. Sometimes I look up at the bright moon from the glass window, and look down at the grass. I can't help but laugh when I think about it in silence. This laughter is not self-satisfaction, but laughing at myself for becoming so docile. In the past, my friends criticized my life as an Eight-legged essay, but I still thought of myself as a prose. Now I think about it, it is neither an Eight-legged essay nor a prose, but simply a Buddhist scripture.</p>
<p>Because I was too idle, I also thought that what I was using my heart for all day long would be used by villains, so I also moved my brain while sitting quietly. Once my brain moves, I have many thoughts, but unfortunately very few can be put into words; because my current life is like a Buddhist scripture, but I have not yet cleansed the six senses. I still want to be a good person, and I want to write down all my thoughts truthfully. I understand very well that writing successful articles cannot feed me, but living a successful life is the way to do it. Writing lighthearted thoughts can be self-satisfying in articles, but this success is useless, and it is not suitable for being a person after all. I have suffered a lot in writing articles over the years. Now I feel that I have made progress - I have the cleverness of "no longer writing articles too successfully".</p>

<h3>Between Victory and Defeat</h3>
<p>— Jiang Shangyu</p>
<p>Last week, I went to watch a soccer game where both sides had several quite "well-known" players. The nature of the game was a "friendly match," but the result was anything but "friendly." Eventually, the actions became rough, with players bumping into each other. The audience also cheered and shouted for attacks, almost turning it into a full-scale brawl. After watching, I couldn't help but shake my head and sigh.</p>
<p>Last year, I returned from America and happened to witness the National Games. Although I study agriculture and wear thick glasses, I am very interested in sports, especially soccer, so I naturally didn't miss any of the soccer matches at the National Games. However, from beginning to end, I only saw fighting from start to finish, except for a few games where the strengths of the teams were vastly different. Especially during the final week of the finals, because those teams were all military teams, some even brought cheerleaders carrying handguns. When the two sides entered the field, they looked like they were bloodshot and ready to shoot, making the referees afraid to go down and blow the whistle. The chief referee had to step in himself. Such a strange phenomenon was truly the first time I had seen it. I think it's because the Chinese take the words "win" and "lose" too seriously. I heard that on the eve of the finals, a team leader warned his players, "You must win this game, or don't come back to see me!" What kind of talk is that? It's a bit like "signing a military order" in Peking opera. If both team leaders tell their players "you must win," then who can be asked to lose? Wouldn't that just mean asking the referee to be beaten and admit defeat?</p>
<p>During my years studying in America, I was a standard soccer fan, willing to pay five or ten dollars for a ticket to a game just to understand what was happening. American soccer is not like the one we play; the ball looks like a green olive. When holding the ball, you can bump, block, and press. We usually call it rugby. If they were as hot-tempered as our players, secretly punching or kicking someone every time they moved, then a single game would result in at least half the people being beaten to death. But when they play, they all follow the rules. Although the competition is thrilling and intense, I have never seen anyone punch another player or the referee.</p>
<p>One thing left a deep impression on me and I will never forget it. That year, our school team held an annual game with the Princeton team. Beforehand, our school coach concentrated the players, practiced hard, and studied tactics, preparing for a long time. On the eve of the departure for the game, a swearing-in ceremony was held in front of the team flag. The principal, coach, and team leader all came to the field in person. The ceremony was simple but solemn and grand. Led by the principal, the entire team prayed to heaven. The prayer was very simple, only four sentences, but at the time, it moved me to tears. The four sentences were:</p>
<p>"If we win, let us win gloriously; if we lose, let us lose gloriously."</p>
<p>What a demeanor, what a spirit! Win, and win gloriously; lose, and lose gloriously. This is not only the spirit of playing ball, but also the spirit of how one should live. As a result, our school team unfortunately lost to Princeton by one point. The players and coaches were of course saddened (this is human nature, inevitable), but all expressed acceptance because the opponent was indeed more skilled. In any case, I never saw anyone say they wanted to beat up the Princeton players or blame the referee.</p>
<p>That day, when I returned to the dormitory, an American classmate asked me if Chinese ball games were also like this. I quickly replied, "Of course, of course," and gave the example of ancient Chinese archery, where one had to "bow before ascending and drink after descending; their competition is gentlemanly." There is also an old saying in Chinese society, "Victory is certainly joyful, but defeat is also met with pleasure," showing that China and foreign countries are the same.</p>
<p>At the time, I actually had no intention of lying. But now, if I were to meet that American classmate again, I would definitely blush greatly.</p>
<p>When will we truly have this open and upright mind, "Victory is certainly joyful, but defeat is also met with pleasure"?</p>
