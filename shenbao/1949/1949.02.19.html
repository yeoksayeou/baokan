<h3>南北分作和平努力　鐘天心稱赴港結果良好　吳裕後等昨訪余漢謀薜岳定明赴港</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十八日電〕政府和談代表鍾天心氏，十七日已由港返穗。據稱：渠此次赴港，曾與中共華南當局負責人商洽和平問題，結果良好，進渠不允透露商談內容。渠並稱，此次赴港，雖非由孫院長派往，但事前已得其同意，足證孫氏決非主戰者，目前之不赴京，純因健康問題。鍾氏最後表示，渠本人卽將飛京謁李代總統，報吿一切及請示進行和談步驟。另息：鍾氏此次赴港，係與蔣總統致孫院長之密函有關。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十八日電〕人民和平代表團之吳裕後，吳哲生等，十八日上午十時謁見余漢謀，下午四時謁薛岳，報吿赴平會晤中共葉劍英經過，並對和平有所獻議。事後，據吳裕後語記者：余薛兩氏對和平無個人成見，概以政府意志為依歸，吳等定廿日赴港訪問在港中共人士。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十八日電〕吳裕後頃為報載南京市參議會批評渠等言行一節，發表書面談話如下：「報載南京市參議會有誤解本團組織之事，殊屬遺憾。查本團係中國各大敎授，國策研究會，與中國人民和平策進會聯合組成，並非由南京市參議會產生，此次赴平，亦非代表南京市市民與中共言和，啓行時除由行政院撥發專機一架送平外，更從未向任何方面領取分文路費。至所發表言論，決本公正立塲，絕無挑撥國共間感情之事，凡此種種，均可覆查。今外間有不明眞相者，如南京市參議會等，對本團之若干批評，顯然出於有意或無意之誤解，特此鄭重聲明』。</p>
<p>〔合衆社香港十八日電〕據十八日廣州方面消息：南京人民和平代表團團員吳裕後敎授，業巳透路該團對中共提出七點和平建議，並經中共北平市長葉劍英允許轉交中共中央執行委員會討論。此七項建議為：（一）立卽停戰；（二）雙方軍隊各自現陣地後撤四十里；（三）雙方釋放政治犯；（四）雙方保證言論自由；（五）國軍與共軍應統一整編為國防軍，全部軍力當裁减百分之四十，並扶助其裁减人負，轉而從事農工商業；（六）組織包括各黨領袖的聯合政府，其組織採六，六，六制，卽國共兩黨各佔六人，其他黨派代表六人；（一）政治協商會議的召開地點，完全由中共決定。吳氏並稱；葉劍英曾表示，中共願意完成「全面和平」，渠認為中共對和平具有誠意。吳氏巳將赴平經過報吿行政院院長孫科，但渠拒絕透露孫科的反應。吳氏及同來廣州的該團團員吳哲生，王醒魂等三人，或將在十九日離穗返京。</p>
<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕據廣州訊：一國民黨權威方面十七日吿合衆社稱，一般預料孫科將在十天之內辭職，此一方面曾在過去數天中曾與政府領袖舉行過會議，對蔣總裁之可能出山之報吿似並不相信。</p>
<p>據頃自北平加來之南京敎授和平代表團團長吳裕後告衆社稱：孫科已定日內赴京與李代總統會晤，俾提前和平之途徑。吳氏並證實行政院副院長吳鐵城卽將來京。在廣州之發展，已暗示吳裕後敎授企圖說服政府官員「中共之和平努力及誠意者」，顯然已順利成功。敎授和平代表團業已完成其與孫科·吳鐵城及其他敎授之會議，一般預料彼等將於週末來京。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十八日電〕今日據悉，上海和平代表團顏惠慶等昨在六國飯店接見友好數人，但未提及任何公事。代表團何時離平尙未決定。</p>
<h3>立院復會期已近　地點爭持未解決　童冠賢抵京謁李代總統</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕立法院院長童冠賢於十八日下午一時由滬飛京，處理關於立院復會之準備事宜。又，記者昨曾訪在滬立委數人，徵詢其對此次復會之日期及討論之主題等。彼等大致對預定復會日期（卽指本月二十六日）並無異議，惟屆時是否能足法定人數甚表懷疑，至復會後討論之主題，一般均認為政治性議案必多於法律性之議案，同時有人主張應以與共黨進行和談之內容為首要案件。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕立法院長童冠賢，十八日下午三時自滬乘機返抵京，立院秘書長陳克文等曾至機塲迎候。據童氏語記者；在滬與各立委曾就立院復會之地點及日期交換意見，惟截至目前為止，復會之地點尙未決定，各地立委對復會地點意見猶未一致，尙待繼續疏通。記者詢以京滬立委如已主張在京復會，且人數已超過集會之法定人數，是否卽可在京復會？童氏稱：無論在何地復會，立院將儘量表現出立院之「整個」性，總希將各地立委之意見疏通一致後，再行決定復會地點。童氏謂，余身為院長，對於復會之地點，個人決無意見。渠談話時，反復提及「整個」性，殷殷以避免分歧為言，表現其對於立院復會地點問題所持能度之愼重及維護團結之用心。刻童氏及秘書長陳克文均正為立院復會問題努力疏通各方意見中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕童冠賢十八日晚晋謁李代總統，就立院復會地點及日期等有所商談。</p>
<p>留京立委訪童院長</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕留京立委十八日下午再開談話會，交換對復會問題之意見，仍堅持在京復會，惟以時間緊迫，開會通知應卽早發出，當推定盧郁文·李峯·王鴻韶三委員卽向童冠賢院長商洽，請作最後決定。下午六時許，盧等訪謁童氏，據實表示，此事當俟謁李代總統請示後再作決定。</p>
<p>留穗立委　分電促駕</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十八日電〕留穗立委聯誼會，十八日致電京滬杭等地立委，促請來穗商談一切，電文如下：「京·滬·杭·渝·蓉·桂·昆·長沙·台北·福州·南昌市政府轉立法委員聯誼會公鑒：本院留穗同仁一致遵照一月廿五日在京座談會公同決議在穗復會，現已屆期，務希尅日飛臨廣州，商談一切。關於食宿等事，已由秘書處妥善辦理，諸請釋念。來穗交通工具，已商請行政院電各省市政府及交通機關妥為代辦。留穗立法委員聯誼會丑（二月）巧（十八日）。</p>
<p>推派代表　交換意見</p>
<p>〔又電〕留穗立法委員聯誼會十八日就復會地點問題，向中央社記者發表談話稱：政府遷穗，本院一月廿五日在京舉行談話會一致決定在廣州復會，幷經上海同人談話會同意，秘書處業已到穗辦公，積極籌備復會事宜，是本院第三會期自應在廣州復會；嗣因一部份同人有主張在京復會者，在穗同人以為變更開會地址，則與以前談話會決定意見不無出入，故主張先徵詢各地同人意見，最好分別投票取決多數。現經在穗同人一再商談，決定推派代表分往京·滬·杭·桂·蓉·渝及台灣等地，交換意見，務求本院同人意志集中，以應艱鉅。</p>
<h3>吳副院長　改今飛京</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十八日電〕吳副院長原定十八日飛京，茲因尙有要公待理，特改期十九日成行。又，渠十八日在穗歡宴外部高級職員，對外交事宜有所指示。</p>
<h3>陳立夫暗示記者　大局週內可明朗</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十八日電〕政委陳立夫頃語記者稱：渠此次來穗，純為料理戴季陶之喪事。陳氏對政治觀感問題拒不作答，祗對當前物價指為一大經濟危機。但渠暗示大局週內卽可明朗。渠並稱：蔣總統引退後，遊山玩水，逍遙自在。陳氏定日內離穗，惟往何處則未宣布。</p>
<p>〔聯合社廣州十八日電〕陳立夫今日在此否認，外傳其擬鞏固廣州集團反對李代總統對共妥協政策之說，據稱本人來穗僅係訪友，報載各種傳說使余大惑不解·</p>
<h3>川省政局已澄淸　劉文輝王纘職袂飛渝　張羣定廿一日就職視事</h3>
<p>〔本報成都十八日電〕劉文輝·王纘緒十九日聯袂飛渝，參加渝綏署會議及張羣就職典禮，川政局醞釀變化，經張氏來蓉後已吿澄淸。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十八日電〕張羣來渝兩日，先後會晤川主席王陵基·康主席劉文輝及滇黔兩省代表楊適生，何輯五，對安定西南自力建設等項商談獲有端倪。頃悉，張氏已定下星期一就職，同時就職者尙有副主任錢大鈞·及兼參謀畏蕭毅肅·秘書長徐思平。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十八日電〕錢大鈞·蕭毅肅於十八日下午一時半自京飛抵渝。蕭談此來係參加張羣主任就職典禮，事畢卽返京。錢　兩氏於四時共赴官邸應張羣之歡宴。又，張氏決廿一日上午十時視事。</p>
<h3>經合署援華建議　週後可提國會　賴樸翰將出席加以說明</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十八日電〕美經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼今吿中央社記者稱：援華計劃之臨時建議，一俟國會結束關於歐洲復原計劃之討論後，卽行提出國會。參院外委會今巳結束此項討論，然衆院外委會最早亦須下週四方能完成是項工作。兩委會須討論準備一週後方能向國會提出建議。霍夫曼稱：賴樸翰十日內可抵華府，並在關於中國計劃提交國會前，解决一切特殊問題，復出席國會委會，就此事加以說明。（顧維鈞要求經合署撥款協助我留美生消息刋第二版）</p>
<h3>抗抵共黨　尚有機會</h3>
<p>杭貝克氏主張援華</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十八日廣播：前國務院遠東司長杭貝克，在外交政策協會中稱：「倘共產黨控制中國，亞洲大部份將受威脅，同時吾人被捲入戰爭旋渦之可能性亦將增加。美國必須同時在歡洲及亞洲方面遏阻共產主義，而中國實為開始之最佳地區」。哥倫比亞大學敎授裴佛則持反對意見稱：「吾人倘以侷處廣州之可憐的政府，及富有的政治難民紛紛避居之台灣，認為反對共產主義之另一堡壘，而再浪費數十億美元，則危險殊甚。今局面如此破碎，當然更不需要」杭貝克當辯稱：「如中國竟淪於共黨之手，則中國以南，以西，以東之地區之共黨，必將獲得成功，此乃自然之趨勢也。美國在中·菲·韓·日等地之投資及權益，屆時亦必將大受威脅，而我人在東亞之友邦，屆時亦可能全部消滅。歐洲如不能得到東亞之資源及貿易，則全部復興之望必成泡影。亞洲共黨之力量愈見增强，則民主國家與克里姆林宮間之衝突愈有成為「熱戰」之可能。我人援歐之種種投資，迅將為蘇聯所攫奪。我人常聞若干並無根據之消息，謂中國政府貪汚無能，不可救藥，然我人今日必須覺醒，須知國民黨人仍在阻止共黨之前進。中共至今所佔之地城，尙不及中國全境之半。中共缺乏行政人員，故佔地雖言，其統治實甚脆弱。今日至少尙有機會，可延長抵抗共黨之努力。我人應在道義上及物質上，對此種抵抗共黨之努力予以支持。」</p>
<h3>中共對內戰責任　在廣播中有辯正</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十八日廣播：今日陝北中共電台發表新華社長篇社論，以「評國民黨對於戰爭責任問題的幾種答案」為題，對中國此次內戰之責任，有所辯正。文中引述蔣總統。孫院長及李代總統之文吿及談話，加以評列，認為戰爭責任應由國民黨負責。關於政府方面指責中共「遲遲不指派代表」之「拖延」一點，證明「因為確定戰犯名單是件大事，少了多了，都不合實際，故須與各民主黨派人民團體互相商量，以此「拖延」了一段時間，並且未能迅速指派代表，引起孫科之流頗為不快；但是大約不要很久，戰犯名單就可公佈，代表就可指派，談判就可開始，孫院長就不能說我們迷信武力了。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕當上海和平代表團正在北平與中共討論終止內戰之方法之際，而中共電台仍</p>
<h3>徐堪劉攻芸謁李代總統　縝密研討經濟措施　新方案尚須經政務會通過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財長徐堪，國行總裁劉攻芸，主計長龍松舟，連日在滬與各方洽商新以濟措施，公畢已於昨日上午十一時聯袂飛京，謁李代總統請示一切。新經濟方案公佈之期在下週初，聞內容要點除准許黃金自由公開賣買，銀元價格逐日掛牌，規定黃金與銀元間之法定比率等外，並為求經濟物價之穩定起見，將禁止本市國行金銀之南運，並加强美援物資之拋售。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕新經濟方案卽將公佈實施聲中，財長徐堪，國行總裁劉攻芸及一部財經要員，十八日下午一時自滬乘機飛抵京。徐劉兩氏下機略事休息後，卽於下午三時半晋謁李代總統，報吿目前財經狀况及各地物價波動情形，並將通日在滬與各方商討擬就之新經濟方案面呈李代總統，作最後請示。李代總統對目前財政經濟情况垂詢甚詳，並就新方案中要點作詳細縝密研的，歷一小時，迄四時半，兩氏始行辭出。據悉：新方案尙須經政務會議討論通過後始可公佈實施。徐堪劉攻芸兩氏十八日在京請示後，將於十九日晨自京飛穗，將新經濟方案呈孫院長於政務會議中提出討論。</p>
<p>〔又電〕徐堪·劉攻芸，十八日晚九時再度晋謁李代總統，對經濟方案再作縝密研討。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕徐堪晋謁李代總統後，在何應欽私邸語本報記者：新經濟方案確已在商討擬訂中，惟尙未最後定案。記者詢以是否尙須經政務會議通過？徐答：「當然，當然！」記者再以金銀是否准許自由公開買賣及發行硬幣問題相詢時，徐僅笑而不答，節想忙與記者道別。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十八日電〕工商部對紗布南運問題，經決定予以放寬，惟數量仍待商決，劉維熾部長將於日內赴滬，主要任務為商討開放輸管尺度，以加强對外貿易。</p>
<h3>閻錫山續與各首長接觸　李代總統昨曾親訪長談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕閭主任錫山，自某地返京後，十八日繼績與李代總統·何應欽·徐永昌等往返密談。十八日上午十時半，李代總統親赴中國旅行社首都飯店往訪閻氏，長談達兩小時，於十二時半始行辭出。下午二時，徐永昌往訪，談話甚久。四時許，閻氏往訪何應欽，並與徐堪·劉攻芸等商太原經濟及空運糧食所需汽油之結匯問題，亦長談達一小時許，晚復與徐永昌長談。十八日往訪閻氏者，計有張耀明·賀耀組等。于院長右任於中午實請閻氏，並請徐永昌·孫楚·張耀明·孫蔚如等多人作陪。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十八日電〕閻錫山之發言人，今日否認外傳閻昨夜飛赴奉化與蔣介石會晤之說，堅稱閻氏並未離京。在指斥李代總統之和平努力。</p>
<p>中共電台廣播稱：「在過去一月中，李宗仁所頒佈之和平措施置，已顯示「毫無價值」，李的命令並未為人遵宗」。「李宗仁所宣佈之一切排除障礙和平之若干措置已為行政院所取消」。中共陝北電台又斥責李宗仁「僅足欺騙人民，而蔣介石則在幕後拉綫」。蓋李發表其「和平措置」之後，民主份子之遭逮捕及迫害人民一如以前。</p>
<h3>中共兩種廣播　所方不盡相同</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕中共電台有兩種廣播，其一為英文電碼廣播，三年來由聯合駐在舊金山收聽，內戰正酣時常為中共與外界之惟一聯絡。其二為華語發音廣播，惟兩者所言不盡相同。華語廣播以口授筆錄之速度誦讀，每字重複，使各華報及其他注意收聽者可準確錄出。上月份中共華語廣播中，要求李代總統拘捕蔣介誠意，英語廣據中則未聞有此警吿。最近之華語廣播重又引起注意，華人方面認為共方己願意緩和其戰犯要求。另一廣播指出國民政府無力謀和，李代總統不能控制政府區域，尤為無力。據共方稱，國民黨政府之一美國主人」，命其試作全面和平解決，不料政府官員因共軍之勝利而「沮喪渙散」，謀作局部抵抗。華語廣播中亦頗多反美資料，但不如英語廣播之多。</p>
<h3>川和促會成立　揭櫫五項主張</h3>

<h3>賴樸翰氏返美述職</h3>
<p>美國經濟合作總署中國分署署長賴樸翰返美述職，已於前晨自滬啟程飛美。本報記者曾向該分署發言人探詢賴氏此次返國之任務，據吿稱。。此行主要任務乃在向經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼報告中國分署之工作情形，留美時間久暫，目前尙未能決定，至於賴氏是否向霍夫曼署長建議增加對華援助，在賴氏對霍氏提出報吿之前，未便有所表示。</p>
<p>賴氏返美述職，雖屬尋常事件，但在中國政局動盪不定的今日，美援是否繼續辦下去，已爲全國人民所關初，何况賴氏在離華返美之前，曾往廣州一行，與孫院長吳副院長兼外長會晤，其必對援華政策有相當關係，可想而知。外傳賴氏曾在穗談稱：渠將返國要求美國擴大援外計劃，或延長現行援華計劃期限至三月四日以後等語，雖經中國分署發言人否認，但料非全屬捕風捉影之談。賴氏於十四日自港抵滬後，徐財長即偕中央銀行劉總裁前去訪晤，就美援運用問題，商談甚久；同時，司徒大使亦自京來滬，與頓氏有所會商。此外，苦守危城的太原綏署主任閻錫山將軍，爲了太原糧食問題的日趨嚴重，亦特從太原飛來上海，訪晤行將返國的賴氏，討論太原的空投問題，而閻將軍之守太原，又素爲美國所重視。由此各端看來，這次賴氏返美述職，乃負有相當的任務。美援的繼續與否，固爲一般人士所關切，但全國人民的普遍心理，都在迫切期望賴氏返國後能擴大美國的對華經濟援助。</p>
<p>中國是產業落後的國家，雖然號稱『以農立國」，但因生產方式的故步自封不求改進，連佔全國人口百分之八十以上的農民，也不免於凍餒，根本談不到國計民生。再加以八年抗戰三年內爭，把全國人民衣食所依的農村，毀壞得支離破碎，和十餘年前的面目，完全改觀了。在這種塲合，爲了國家的復興與經濟的繁榮，爲了人民的生活水準，自然希望友邦能授手援溺，並欲以此外援作爲復興經濟的起點。在勝利之初，聯合國善後救濟總署的來華工作，美國政府的源源援華，使受惠的中國人民，無不感激友邦的援助。可惜三年以來，一則因中國內在的障礙，戰亂的烽火蔓延及於全國，使我國人不能警用外援，以此作爲復興的資本。再則由於外援的分量不够與物資的需求不合，即使國內太平無事，也很難使中國走上工業化的途徑。</p>
<p>過去的三年，中國人民像做了一塲惡夢，而美國對於援華態度的忽冷忽熱，尤令人如墜五里霧中。時至今日，州內的情形又發生了絕大的變化，美國援華計劃的期限雖將屆滿，但杜魯門總統提交國會的咨文，僅有援助西歐各國的計劃，而獨對中國尙未有隻字涉及，不僅使中國人民大失所望，且使正義感的中國友人也認爲不智。最近美國輿論界對於政府當局所抱的對筆態度，時加指購，可見一斑。杜魯門總統為澄淸國內奧情起見，乃於本月十四日向國會提出經濟合作總署的第二期工作報告，他說：「吾人刻正從事特種努力，俾儘可能保證經合總署的供給品，源源運往中國，使中國中央政府控制地區４及華北圍城市獲益。便如經合總署的棉花，已使中國最大工業的機輪維持旋轉，以供應重要的棉熾物，不但在中國的國內市塲銷售，並且輸往遠東其他國家。』從這個報吿中固可以看出杜魯門總統本人，對於美援的成效，不能不表示相當的樂觀。最後杜魯門總統又鄭重聲明。。「美國對中國的援助，必須爲中國本身努力增加生產及供應的一種補助，而不能代替中國本身的努力。』所謂天助自助，杜魯鬥總統之言，確實是至理名言，是値得中國人民深切反省的。</p>
<p>每一個善良的中國人民，原來沒有一個不把「自力更生」看做金科玉律的。但若沒有外援的輔助而專靠自已的力量，則在「更生」的進程中自不免因之遲緩。我們迫切盼望美國當局高瞻遠矚，不遲疑，不徘徊，繼續加緊援助苦難的中國人民。深望賴樸翰先生能將我們中國人民的心情與願望，轉吿美國朝野人士！</p>

<h3>康納利對大西洋公約　再度申明美國立場　保證協助對傳付任何侵略　應取步驟美何留主動權</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十七日電〕杜魯門總統堅持渠之信念，認爲建議中之北大西洋公約，足爲一種預先之通知與明確之證據，卽參加該公約之各國將聯合一致，決心抵抗任何武裝襲擊。渠在今日記者招待席上，重申此項信念。第一次係上月渠在就職演辭中所宣佈者。杜魯門總統不願答覆關於該公約更進一步之問題，但指出艾契遜於星期三舉行記者招待會之前，曾與渠商議，艾契遜與渠兩人之意見完全相同。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕參院外委會主席康納利十八日稱，大西洋公約如無參院絕大多數之贊同，將「較無用更壞」。此項勸吿已傳達到國務卿艾契遜。艾氏擬於十八日下午向該委會提出關於美國在談判中地位之簡略。康氏吿訪員等稱，此一反侵略公約之主力，在於西歐明瞭美國會堅決支持該公約，此點自國會之宣戰時權而來。渠稱，「卽使該公約獲得參院三分之二必要多數票而批准，亦嫌不足。如無一致擁護，該公約可能較無用更壞。」康納利繼稱，卽使衆院不審査協定，但衆院之擁護亦屬必需，因衆院在關於宣戰方面亦有同樣發言權。康氏並稱，渠認爲目前西半球防禦公約中，下列兩條或可配合歐洲新協議：（一）事先保證美國將「協助應付進攻」，但有一項保留，美國究應採取何種迅速步驟之決定，換諸美國之手。（二）訂約國之多數可下令採取除戰爭以外之斷絕外交關係及停止貿易與交通等步驟。艾契遜諒將於此後數日內，會晤加拿大及英法荷比盧等國大使，以及參預公約談判之其他團體，渠將吿以參院外委會對該公約現行措詞之反應。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕地產商陶建華，浦東人，年逾不惑，寓林森中路寶康里廿四號。三十六年四月廿一日，陶曾遭持械匪徒六人洗刦，損失金條飾物及華貴衣服，估計値黃金百兩左右。事後曾報警務當局通緝在案，迄未戈獲。不意昨日午後二時許，陶途經湖北路大新街時，忽然遇見一軍人模樣之人，面有白麻，似曾相識，再三思維，頓時想起該軍人係六盜之一，遂尾隨其後，跟至漢口路其昌旅社樓上某號室，微聞房內人聲嘈雜，乃不動聲色，至老閘警分局報告。當由刑事股長張魁棟飭巡官王安邦督率幹警宋家寳等會同陶建華　警備車馳往該旅社，其時見有軍人六名緩步下樓，經陶指認後，卽由員警上前，一併帶局偵訊，並在三人身畔抄出槍械三支，據陶稱：被盜洗刦後，直至去秋八月十二日下午五時許，忽有着軍裝持手槍者兩人，稱係第一綏靖司令部派來，任意毆人，並搗毀家具等物，旋卽離去。孰知彼等不時到來滋擾，不得已，曾具文呈報綏靖司令部詢問，據復並無派人等情。據悉該批匪徒去年曾往南通沿海一帶槍刦魚民十一戶，臨走時並將各事主一一綑綁拋投大海中，當時被害人之家屬曾報吿警備部通緝，結果捕獲從犯三人，詎仍被名袁國祥之匪首用綏靖司令部名義向警備部將該三人退回南通釋放，末後並將被害人家屬悉數殺戮。袁等則逍遙法外，警備部得悉後，曾四出通緝袁犯未獲，且警備部屢次派人至陶宅打聽袁之踪跡，並要求協助，而陶亦不知其下落云云。詢之帶局之六軍人，據供，名袁國祥，袁國震，莊秉良，耿懷宸，陸權，李家彬等。陶並於警局中電警備部派承辦員到局認明袁確係通緝之要犯。旋經分局請示兪局長後，諭將原被吿並解總局偵緝科偵訊核辦。</p>

<h3>利賣空氣濃厚　棉紗一致挫跌　布市人心虛怯趨勢疲軟</h3>
<p>棉紗銷勢平庸，染指者稀，兼之銀根報聚，以及利賣空氣頻傳，新買不前，人心虛怯，各紗急轉直下。</p>
<p>四三支藍鳳初由上日五十九萬元之原擋開出，旋以各方買意甚淡，浮多絡續脫手，終以五十萬元收市，軋跌九萬元。餘如天女及金城等，亦趨疲乏。四〇支藍鳳跌七萬元，三二支銀月，自四十四萬元步小至四十萬元結束，終降五萬元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現出初以三十五萬元開出，最後以三十萬元低檔收市，較前小四萬元，隔天出做三十二萬元。二〇支雙馬軋降五萬元，以二十八萬元收市，其餘金城及天女，皆以低檔結束。一六支以下各級，亦均皆挫降。</p>
<p>棉布漲風已戢，良以市上銀根重償，本客納胃已見飽和，且新經濟措施卽將發表，故人心甚爲顧忌，散戶逼於頭寸者，脫手不已，市勢頓吿疲軟。</p>
<p>喇叭童細布由一萬二千五百五十元，一路盤跌至一萬二千三百元收市，較前降一千六百元。B龍頭細布終挫一千七百元，以一萬二千元結束。此外如三桃及大雙龍等細布，亦跟隨下游。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰始以一萬三千元開出後，曾高至一萬三千二百元，臨收聞黑赤報挫，其勢乃吿不支而退，終爲一萬二千二百五十元，軋跌二千一百元。四君子元直貢自一萬二千七百元步小至一萬二千元收市，終降一千九百元，其他各布廠盤，亦開小二千元左右。</p>

<h3>銀根先平後俏</h3>
<p>市間銀根，昨晨走勢呈穩，業外貨帮，對於物價前途，多抱觀望態度，以致需單較减，而頭寸供源則旺，市塲拆息，仍站日拆七十元至儿十元間，合月息昻達二元以上。近午銀根走勢帶緊，週轉極見頻冗。</p>
<p>現鈔昨市仍有匱象，因航幫求亟，以爲逃避高匯水之手段。中央銀行三日來發出紅色一百元券，幾近五十億元，但籌碼續枯，行莊限領藥嚴，貼水坐四分左右</p>
<h3>金債牌價又高</h3>
<p>黃金短期公債，昨日國行牌價定爲每兩七萬五千元。本市中中交農四行及中信局共售出公債票面黃金三百兩</p>
<h3>證交準備業　昨開常理會議</h3>

<h3>整理美金公債</h3>
<p>財部凝定條例呈院核示</p>
<p>關於外幣債券整理辦法，茲由政院核定原則，令財部擬訂具體辦法呈院核示，現財部已遵令換具卅八年整理美金公債條例呈院，轉送立法院審議。據悉：財部對過去尙未給付本息之美金公債，將發行甲乙丙三種債票掉換。一·甲種債票掉換民國卅六年第一二期短期庫券·二·乙種債粟掉換民國卅七年美金公債英金美金債票，及民國卅一年同盟勝利美金公債·三·丙種債票掉換民國廿九年建設公使，第一期美金英金債票。以上三種債票，均按債票票面一元掉換一元。將來到期還本付息，一律折合美金支付·還本期限，將予延長。整理獎金公債數額，共爲一萬三千餘萬美金。</p>

<h3>銀根緊·暗息昂　食米先漲後回　粉糧油餅均一致下挫</h3>
<p>昨日食米市勢，先漲後回，初市以戶口米價上漲過鉅，人心混亂，在貨主竭力扳抬下，曾一度上漲，後以銀根緊俏，暗息高昻，進戶存心觀望，脚地空虛，市勢終告不支，而略見下挫。臨收白粳退站萬零百元，其他各檔貨微趕下游，計薄稻一〇二〇〇元，早稻九九〇〇元，特粳一〇四〇〇元，北市白粳站定，仍以一〇一〇〇元做開。</p>
<p>麵粉　市勢急轉直下，緣因銀根緊　，各物均小，人心頗軟，加以利空消息瀰漫市塲，貨主居高思危，售意頗切，初市去化良好，貨主掙扎，疲落不多，後以客帮沉寂，實銷滯呆，市勢急挫，兵船臨收跌做三千八百元，老車退守四千關，麩皮挫落成餘，福新大包回站三千關。</p>
<p>雜糧　全面回瀉，黃豆囤戶大量出籠，乍豆激降二成，以七千元成交，車豆降落二千元，平湖杜豆跟挫成餘，生仁跌一成，揚州生仁退進二萬關，芝蔴交易仍盛，市價普降千元，紅糧乏人問津，成交不足百包。</p>
<p>食油　猛烈下降，豆油猛挫二成餘，站守四萬蘭，廠開均以四萬元收盤，生油疾退八千元，江北吉桶今以四萬五千元成交，生菜油跌進四關，以三萬六千元收盤。蔴油亦在一片賣出聲中，疾降七八千元。豆餅跟挫成半，仁記餅今做三千二百元。</p>
<p>食糖盤跌</p>
<p>食糖前日市况因圈外金鈔狂升疾退，走勢跟隨，前市均多軋漲，昨日金價續趨下游，人心奇軟，惟因台幣比率一再掛低，漲後脚地尙堅。四五號車白糖午收一八〇〇元，挫落三百元，粗砂一七五〇元，亦跌三百元。中砂與白綿赤無貨應市，均未做開外，其餘各檔均普跌三四百元</p>
<p>桐油虛軟</p>
<p>桐油昨市，貨方雖圖高扳，但自隔晚脚地轉虛後，刻下又因同業頭寸趨緊，以及圈外物資均呈不支，是以市氣亦難站住，臨收結果，紅白桐油一致下瀉一二千元不等，底盤仍不鞏固</p>
<h3>絲綢賡續挫跌</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况繼續疲軟，市上銀根略鬆，惟暗息仍在八九十元間，執戶負祖甚重，了售頗股。T-20號有光新貨先以五十萬元低盤開做，中間聞金價續小，各物均無好面，人心極虛，塲上一片賣出聲，市勢續吿下游，午收跌至四五萬元。午後金價跌後轉升，人心略穩，市勢稍見起色，喊價好起萬元。</p>
<p>生絲以外匯證走勢盤旋，黃金黑市續小，人絲棉紗繼續報跌，人心不見振奮，市况賡續下游。優級先開四八萬元，最後做至四七萬，輯里千經普通另担等，走勢亦軟行情均見挫跌。午後市勢略見起色，惟交易仍稀，優級喊價微升二萬元。</p>
<p>綢緞市勢均神帶小，美亞被面初做三一五〇〇〇元，開後市上消息利空，國外金鈔紗布一致報小，榮中銀根寬緊不一，人心萎靡，散多了空，市况重見低游，跌進三〇萬邊。嗣後檯面逢低有吸，買風稍動，市價低後轉升，惟因大勢均疲，前途無甚好面，結果三〇六〇〇〇元收盤，其餘各檔普跌一成半。</p>
<h3>烟皂臨收回上</h3>
<p>捲烟皂火，前市甫開卽承昨日跌勢之餘波，依然下跌。過程以報載卽將公佈新經濟方案，且將嚴厲取締不法投機商人，因之各方人心均吿懈怠。圈外物價亦受此影響，一致下跌，捲烟皂火當不例外，於是亦跟隨下降。塲內拆息平穩，做八角光景。白鍚包猛跌二百元，十支大英亦挫三百元，其餘各檔均吿下跌。惟後以大戶乘低納取，價稍見回秀。固本又做一萬五千一百元，與昨日軋平。其餘雜牌升沉互見，火柴均跌一·二千元不等。</p>
<h3>輸管會聲明　油價調整經過</h3>
<p>關於汽柴油價格迭次上漲事，據輸管會有關方面負責人說明，各項油料價格之核定，在去年八一九以前，係根據去年五月間經行政院核定之自動調整公式，計算新價，由輸管會核定施行，事後呈報備案。自八月十九日幣制改革，至限價辦法廢止後，決定油價之各項因素，如匯率指數運費等項，不斷上漲。爰於去年十月間遵奉行政院電，由轍管會美援運用委員會會同美經合分署合組石油價格審定委員會，負責辦理。並經會議擬具油價計算公式，藉作依據，呈奉行政院核准施行在案。公式規定上項因素上漲，超過核定限度時，得予調整售價。故油料售價之調整。係由上列三機構共同核定後，報院備案，並非輸管會單獨所能決定者云</p>

<h3>三個歐洲長跑家　在美國轟動一時　創造了許多精彩紀錄</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約訊〕在美國室內田徑賽中，歐洲長跑專家如海格及漢森等亦失敗而歸，但是另有兩個瑞典人及一個比利時人，最後卒如願以償。此爲美國本年一月比賽中之精彩節目。</p>
<p>瑞典之貝格森及阿爾敦曾在三次比賽中各勝二次，比利時之列夫，參加一次比賽，卽贏得一次，列夫係世運會五千米寇軍，荷蘭之史列克斯在比賽中，皆以極近距離落後，名列第二。史在一月廿一日費城一哩賽跑中，敗於貝格森，一月廿九日在密爾洛斯一哩賽跑中，復敗於美國之蓋爾曼手中，但是蓋不得不全力以赴，跑出了四分零九秒五成續，始將史打倒。歐洲長跑家有如此之成績，可謂一鳴驚人，因爲在以前，歐人終是失敗的原因，是不慣木質跑道，或者彼等的體質不濟。</p>
<p>在本月有兩項平世界紀錄的成績，一爲羅特島的杜華伊，在密爾洛斯運動會中，六十碼成績爲六·一秒，但這是不主要的節目，以前曾有十四人平此記錄。</p>
<p>貝格森在費城運動會中以四分一秒四嬴得一英哩冠軍，在一月廿二日波斯登運動會中，以二分十四秒取得一千碼冠軍，但後來因牙疾及其兒子遭禍，致心緒不寗，故在密爾洛斯運動會一英哩賽跑中，竟名落孫山。</p>
<p>瑞典的阿爾敦在費城遝動會中，以九分十二秒贏得二哩長跑，在波斯登運動會中之成績，爲九分三·二秒，創該會記錄。而在密爾羅斯運動會之二哩比賽中，列夫以八分五六·一秒獲得冠軍，阿爾頓以八分五六·六秒第二，在紐約運動會中的一哩賽跑中，史列克斯與蓋爾曼皆以四分九·五秒平，但蓋爾曼在到繩綫時，淸楚地在前。</p>
<p>狄拉特在去年各次運動會中，爲最矚目的人，現在　然無色，雖則他可穩取跑欄冠軍，如一九四八年一樣，及曾經平世界記錄，同時伊立諾州之撐高跳名將李却士在波城運動會的成績爲四呎八吋，據說他相信在本季以前，可達到十五呎，在歷史僅有一人，卽華默丹姆撐過十五呎之高。　歐洲人參加運動會，對賣座顯然大有關係，費城運動會有萬名觀衆，紐約運動會有一萬六千名觀衆。戶內田徑賽季節，在一月底以前不致開始，迄今主要節目之成績如下。</p>
<p>一英哩——蓋爾曼（美）四分九·五秒，史列克斯（荷）四分九·五秒。</p>
<p>二英哩——列夫（比）八分五六·一秒。阿爾頓（瑞典）八分五六秒·六·　一千碼——貝格森（瑞典）二分十四·五秒。</p>
<p>五十碼高欄——狄拉特（美）六·一秒平世界記錄。</p>
<p>八十碼——杜華伊（美）六·一秒平世界訊錄。</p>
<p>跳遠李却士（美）十四呎八吋。</p>
<p>跳高——維斯洛基（美）六呎七又四分之三吋。</p>
<p>六百碼——哥特（美）一分十二秒五。</p>
<p>八百八十碼——康姆福特（美）一分五十四秒二。</p>
<p>六十碼高欄——狄拉特（美）七·三秒。</p>
<p>三十五磅鐵鎚——法爾頓（美）五十七呎九又二分。</p>
<p>跳遠——吉爾斯（美）二二呎八吋又二分。</p>
<p>十六磅鉛球——美耶（美）五十二呎二吋又二分之一。</p>

<h3>南中國　安定堡壘　榆林港踏勘</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　梁智</p>
<p>〔本報海南島十二日航訊〕瓊南孤懸海外，因交通不便，內地人們對他非常隔閱，但是瓊南楡林港的治安。軍事。政治，以及當地人民的風土人情，實在値得報導，內地的人們，亦迫切需要明瞭，所以記者實地觀察之餘，寫些粗淺翔實的情形在下面，俾供一般關心南中國近况者參考。</p>
<p>山環山抱</p>
<p>瓊南楡林港，地處熱帶，四季溫暖如初夏，山明水秀，海闊天空，看過「南海美人魚」影片的人們，或可想像到這裏的旖旎風光了。在她的南端，雖還有幾個小島，但她總算是中國最南端唯一的國防海疆，陸海空軍重要基地，是西南太平洋綫戰略的樞紐，同時又是海南島未來政治經濟的重心。瓊島改制如果一且實現，則將來永久省會所在地，可能設在楡林，因爲她有着先天優越的條件，再加以日人七年的苦心營建，楡林的海軍碼頭，山環水抱，港闊水深，可停泊一萬噸以上的兵艦。現有相當於基隆高雄的新式要塞砲臺設備，尤以港口東西兩砲臺，形勢非常險要，如蟹的兩箝，躭視着內外港，有戰事時可以隨時封鎖，港口控制整個楡林區，守衛着國防的前衛，是南中國安定的堡壘，朱來開發與建設新海南的搖籃。</p>
<p>動亂以外</p>
<p>有人曾預言楡林港是未來的香港，未來的上海，無疑地在動亂而苦難的國度中，她將以英勇而突擊的姿態，朝着大時代邁進。目前島上未靖，然而瓊南的楡林（三亞紅紗）區，甚至於外圍的崖（縣）籘（橋）陵（水）之間，沿公（鐵）路綫治安上，是堪稱良好的，人民的生活還算相當安定。在這裏坐鎭的是海南島要塞司令聶琦將軍，聶將軍是一個粗黑而壯健的標凖軍人，目光灼灼，聲音宏亮，一望而知其爲一個有果斷，有魄力勇敢善戰的傢伙，他於三十七年十一月蒞楡接任視事。</p>
<p>繁榮榆林</p>
<p>數月以來，他集中全力，謀黨政軍的協同一致，整肅部隊紀律，促進軍民合作，銳意從要塞防區的安定中求進步，求發展。他兼任本島南區淸剿司令，恪遵韓司令官意旨；協同配屬部隊，積極恢復汽車公路交通，幷派隊掩護地方秋收，使貨暢其流，民食無處，穩定物價，安定民生，繁榮楡林。楡林港雖然不算是一個大的都市，人口據楡警所的統計，不過二萬餘人，但機關林立，除要塞司令部外，有三亞空軍站及警衛營，海軍巡防處與第四警衛營，陸軍一三一師三九一團，警察分所，陸海軍補給站，此外又有規模宏大的海南鐵鐵局，（配屬有一個鑛警總隊）海南鐵路管理處，崖縣縣黨部，楡林區黨部，財政部楡亞鹽塲公署，漁業管理處，廣東分處，農林部海南水產公司籌備處，楡亞農林試騐塲，還有郵局，電局，中國農民廣東等銀行，文化方面，有楡亞中學，鐵鑛小學，鹽工子弟學校，和平日報，大光報駐莎辦事處，瓊崖通訊分社等。此間陸海空籌組經月之楡亞軍警聯合督察處，自元旦正式成立以來海陸空各單位，均派員兵駐處，協助執行如下各項事宜：（一）嚴整軍風紀，（二）淸査各區戶口重新登記，（三）檢查出入船舶及飛機之旅客，幷經常設站檢査進出口車輛，（四）嚴禁烟賭，肅淸間諜。（五）整蕭市容等任務，僉信楡南將從此日進佳增，而榆林港未來必有一番新氣象。</p>
<p>對外交通</p>
<p>瓊島孤懸海外，對外交通，極端困難，尤以島南楡林港爲甚。現除每月有二次中航班機以外，對於航行楡海（口）穗綫的輪船，還沒有定期，由楡林至海口及黃流北黎的運輸土產，多賴民航船維持，凡是在這裏公敎人員，如遇離職調差，便感到非常頭痛。聞最近要塞部函請上海中航總公司，請由每月二次班機，改爲每週一次班機，以便利公文投遞，已得答復應允，最近改派BC3C-4式小型機，幷籌增每週飛行一次，此外幷商請招商局駐滬辦事處，定期派船航行海楡穗綫，預料對外交通，可能有不少改善。</p>
<p>鹽田經營</p>
<p>瓊南楡（林）亞（三亞）港一帶鹽田，是相當可觀的，隨處可以見到田連阡陌，鹽田卽可知道此間的產鹽，是頗具規模的，戰後復員以還，各漏戶慘淡經營，過去所遭受敵僞的摧殘破壞，已日漸恢復舊觀，惟當復員修復鹽漏時，大致因經濟條例所限，多因陋就簡，故據楡亞鹽坊統計，去年此間產鹽僅二十餘萬担，比較戰前年產三十萬餘担，相差尙遠，去年十二月，農行並試辦鹽貸，因此楡亞各鹽漏修理工作，頗見活躍生氣，本年一月初，　亞　坊分坊長，率令調穗，新坊長王德惠蒞任伊始，強調增產運動，以四十二萬担爲本年產鹽最高目標，鹽業對島民生活關係甚巨，是經濟主要來源之一，此外尤以崖西區鶯歌海的鹽田，規模最爲宏大，淪陷期間，經日人數年盡力策劃。建築工程已稍具基礎，日人原企圖開創爲世界第二大鹽田，計劃供給西南太平洋及其本國軍需工業與民食，惜僅築成十分之一二，日人卽宣吿無條件投降，勝利後，中於國事蜩　，兵連禍結，且島上匪風未靖、政府未暇顧及致令其荒蕪，誠屬遺憾，去年春間，廣州行轅宋主任，曾派開發鶯歌海鹽田，專員吳智咸及工程專家伍履中朱深文等一行蒞楡，轉赴鶯歌海實地考察，預定以二至三年間，完成全部工程，開發人力機械，經費定爲六百萬港幣，建築完成後，每天可產鹽三萬担，每年產約三百萬担以上，（除雨季外）荀此項偉大計劃能早日實現，則每年產鹽不但可足供全國民食，並且可資爲國防軍需工業之需，且可運銷國際市塲，增加國家收入，是則關係民生建國與本島開發建設前途甚鉅，惜乎至今開發鹽田工作，尙未見有實際行動，這眞令島民感到很大的失望。</p>
<p>漁業水產</p>
<p>楡林港不但爲　豐燈饒之區。而且亦係漁業水產之城，島南人民大半賴以爲生，雖以土法可漁，缺乏科學技術與新式漁船、然成績已相當可觀，爲每年土產出口之大宗，去年漁業管理處以廣東分處由穗遷瓊，並派新式漁船前來作業，一年以來成績斐然，如能積極發展，冀能建立華南最大漁業站，則前途當無可限量，又此間籌備經年之海水產公司，聞最近亦可正式成立，未來島南水產漁業必日臻發達，蓋可預卜。</p>

<h3>North and South Strive for Peace; Zhong Tianxin Claims Good Results from Hong Kong Trip; Wu Yuhou and Others Visited Yu Hanmou and Xue Yue Yesterday, Scheduled to Go to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 18th] Government peace negotiation representative Mr. Zhong Tianxin returned to Guangzhou from Hong Kong on the 17th. It is said that during his trip to Hong Kong, he discussed peace issues with responsible persons of the CCP's South China authorities, and the results were good. However, he declined to disclose the content of the talks. He also stated that although this trip to Hong Kong was not dispatched by President Sun, he had obtained his consent beforehand, which proves that Mr. Sun is definitely not a proponent of war. His current failure to go to Nanjing is purely due to health issues. Mr. Zhong finally stated that he himself will soon fly to Nanjing to meet Acting President Li, report everything, and request instructions on the steps for peace talks. In another development, it is learned that Mr. Zhong's trip to Hong Kong was related to a secret letter from President Chiang to President Sun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] Wu Yuhou and Wu Zhesheng, etc., of the People's Peace Delegation, visited Yu Hanmou at 10:00 AM and Xue Yue at 4:00 PM on the 18th to report on their meeting with the CCP's Ye Jianying in Beiping and offered suggestions for peace. Afterwards, according to Wu Yuhou, Yu and Xue have no personal prejudices against peace, but generally abide by the will of the government. Wu and others are scheduled to visit CCP personnel in Hong Kong on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] Wu Yuhou recently issued a written statement regarding a report that the Nanjing Municipal Council criticized their words and deeds: "It is regrettable that the Nanjing Municipal Council has misunderstood the organization of this delegation. This delegation is jointly formed by major Chinese professors, the National Policy Research Association, and the China People's Peace Promotion Association. It was not formed by the Nanjing Municipal Council. This trip to Beiping is not to negotiate peace with the CCP on behalf of the citizens of Nanjing. In addition to the Executive Yuan allocating a special plane to send us to Beiping, we have never received a penny for travel expenses from any party. As for the statements we have made, we are determined to maintain a fair and just position and have absolutely not engaged in anything that would incite discord between the KMT and the CCP. All of this can be verified. Now there are those outside who do not understand the truth, such as the Nanjing Municipal Council, and their criticisms of this delegation are clearly due to intentional or unintentional misunderstandings. This is a solemn statement."</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 18th] According to sources in Guangzhou on the 18th, Professor Wu Yuhou, a member of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, has revealed that the delegation proposed seven peace proposals to the CCP, which were approved by CCP Beiping Mayor Ye Jianying to be forwarded to the CCP Central Executive Committee for discussion. The seven suggestions are: (1) Immediate ceasefire; (2) Both sides' troops withdraw 40 li from their current positions; (3) Both sides release political prisoners; (4) Both sides guarantee freedom of speech; (5) The National Army and the Communist Army should be unified and reorganized into the National Defense Force. All military strength should be reduced by 40%, and those who are reduced should be assisted to engage in agriculture, industry, and commerce; (6) A joint government including leaders of all parties should be organized, adopting a 6-6-6 system, with the KMT and the CCP each occupying six positions, and representatives of other parties occupying six positions; (7) The location for the convening of the Political Consultative Conference shall be determined entirely by the CCP. Mr. Wu also said that Ye Jianying had stated that the CCP is willing to achieve "comprehensive peace" and that he believes the CCP has sincerity for peace. Mr. Wu has reported the experience of going to Beiping to Executive Yuan President Sun Ke, but he declined to reveal Sun Ke's reaction. Mr. Wu and other members of the delegation who came to Guangzhou, Wu Zhesheng and Wang Xinghun, may leave Guangzhou for Nanjing on the 19th.</p>
<p>[United Press, This City News] According to Guangzhou news: a KMT authoritative source told the United Press on the 17th that it is generally expected that Sun Ke will resign within ten days. This source had held meetings with government leaders in the past few days and did not seem to believe reports of President Chiang's possible return to power.</p>
<p>Wu Yuhou, the head of the Nanjing Professor Peace Delegation who just came from Beiping, told the crowd that Sun Ke is scheduled to go to Nanjing within days to meet with Acting President Li in order to advance the path to peace. Wu also confirmed that Executive Yuan Vice President Wu Tiecheng will soon come to Nanjing. Developments in Guangzhou have hinted that Professor Wu Yuhou's attempt to persuade government officials of the CCP's peace efforts and sincerity has apparently been successfully. The Professor Peace Delegation has completed its meetings with Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and other professors. It is generally expected that they will come to Nanjing on the weekend.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 18th] It was learned today that Yan Huiqing and others of the Shanghai Peace Delegation met with several friends at the Six Nations Hotel yesterday, but did not mention any official business. It has not been decided when the delegation will leave Beiping.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Resumption of Sessions Nears; Location Dispute Remains Unresolved; Tong Guanxian Arrives in Nanjing to Visit Acting President Li</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian flew from Shanghai to Nanjing at 1:00 PM on the 18th to handle preparations for the Legislative Yuan's resumption of sessions. Also, reporters interviewed several legislators in Shanghai yesterday to inquire about their views on the date of this resumption of sessions and the topics to be discussed. They generally had no objections to the scheduled resumption date (i.e., the 26th of this month), but expressed serious doubts as to whether a quorum could be reached at that time. As for the topics to be discussed after the resumption of sessions, it is generally believed that political proposals will outnumber legal proposals, and some advocate that the content of peace talks with the Communist Party should be the primary case.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian returned to Nanjing by plane from Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 18th. Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Chen Kewen and others went to the airport to meet him. According to Mr. Tong, he exchanged views with legislators in Shanghai on the location and date of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of sessions. However, as of now, the location of the resumption of sessions has not been decided, and legislators in various places still have inconsistent opinions on the location of the resumption of sessions, which remains to be further coordinated. When reporters asked whether the legislators in Nanjing and Shanghai have already advocated resuming sessions in Nanjing, and the number of people has exceeded the legal quorum for the meeting, whether the sessions can be resumed in Nanjing immediately, Mr. Tong said: No matter where the sessions are resumed, the Legislative Yuan will try its best to show the "completeness" of the Legislative Yuan, and hopes to coordinate the opinions of legislators in various places before deciding on the location of the resumption of sessions. Mr. Tong said that as the President of the Yuan, he personally has no opinion on the location of the resumption of sessions. During his speech, he repeatedly mentioned "completeness," earnestly aiming to avoid divisions, demonstrating his caution in addressing the issue of the location of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of sessions and his efforts to maintain unity. Currently, Mr. Tong and Secretary-General Chen Kewen are working hard to coordinate the opinions of all parties on the issue of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of sessions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Tong Guanxian paid a visit to Acting President Li on the evening of the 18th to discuss the location and date of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of sessions.</p>
<p>Legislators Remaining in Nanjing Visit President Tong</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Legislators remaining in Nanjing held another discussion meeting on the afternoon of the 18th to exchange views on the issue of the resumption of sessions, and still insisted on resuming sessions in Nanjing. However, due to the urgency of time, the meeting notice should be issued as soon as possible. Lu Yuwen, Li Feng, and Wang Hongshao were appointed to consult with Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian and ask him to make a final decision. At around 6:00 PM, Lu and others visited Mr. Tong and truthfully stated that this matter should be decided after visiting Acting President Li for instructions.</p>
<p>Legislators Remaining in Guangzhou Send Telegrams Urging Him to Come</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] The Liaison Association of Legislators Remaining in Guangzhou sent telegrams to legislators in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places on the 18th, urging them to come to Guangzhou to discuss everything. The telegram reads as follows: "To the Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guilin, Kunming, Changsha, Taipei, Fuzhou, and Nanchang Municipal Governments, transfer to the Liaison Association of Legislators: Our colleagues remaining in Guangzhou unanimously abide by the joint resolution of the symposium held in Nanjing on January 25 to resume sessions in Guangzhou. The deadline has now arrived. We hope that you will fly to Guangzhou as soon as possible to discuss everything. The Secretariat has properly arranged food and lodging, so please rest assured. We have requested the Executive Yuan to telegraph the provincial and municipal governments and transportation authorities to handle transportation to Guangzhou. Liaison Association of Legislators Remaining in Guangzhou, Chou (February), Qiao (18th)."</p>
<p>Appoint Representatives to Exchange Views</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Liaison Association of Legislators Remaining in Guangzhou issued a statement to the Central News Agency reporter on the 18th regarding the location of the resumption of sessions, saying: The government moved to Guangzhou. On January 25, the Legislative Yuan held a symposium in Nanjing and unanimously decided to resume sessions in Guangzhou. The Shanghai colleagues also agreed to this at a symposium. The Secretariat has already arrived in Guangzhou to work and is actively preparing for the resumption of sessions. Therefore, the third session of the Legislative Yuan should be resumed in Guangzhou. Later, because some colleagues advocated resuming sessions in Nanjing, the colleagues in Guangzhou believed that changing the meeting address would not be consistent with the opinions decided at the previous symposium, so they advocated first soliciting opinions from colleagues in various places, preferably by voting to determine the majority. After repeated discussions among the colleagues in Guangzhou, it was decided to appoint representatives to go to Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guilin, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Taiwan to exchange views, and strive to concentrate the will of the Legislative Yuan colleagues in order to cope with difficulties.</p>
<h3>Vice President Wu Changes Flight to Nanjing to Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 18th] Vice President Wu was originally scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 18th. However, due to important official business to be handled, the flight has been rescheduled to the 19th. Also, he hosted a banquet for senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangzhou on the 18th and gave instructions on foreign affairs.</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu Hints to Reporters That the Overall Situation May Become Clear Within a Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 18th] Political Committee Member Chen Lifu recently told reporters that his trip to Guangzhou was purely to take care of Dai Jitao's funeral. Mr. Chen declined to answer questions about his political views, only pointing to the current price level as a major economic crisis. However, he hinted that the overall situation may become clear within a week. He also said that after President Chiang retired, he enjoyed游山玩水 and逍遙自在. Mr. Chen is scheduled to leave Guangzhou within days, but has not announced where he will go.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 18th] Chen Lifu denied here today the rumors that he intended to consolidate the Guangzhou group to oppose Acting President Li's policy of compromise with the Communists, claiming that he came to Guangzhou only to visit friends. The various rumors reported have made him very puzzled.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Political Situation Has Been Clarified; Liu Wenhui and Wang Zanxu Fly to Chongqing Together; Zhang Qun Scheduled to Take Office on the 21st</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 18th] Liu Wenhui and Wang Zanxu will fly to Chongqing together on the 19th to attend the Chongqing Pacification Commissioner's Office meeting and Zhang Qun's inauguration ceremony. The brewing changes in the Sichuan political situation have been clarified after Mr. Zhang came to Chengdu.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Since Zhang Qun came to Chongqing two days ago, he has successively met with Sichuan Chairman Wang Lingji, Kang Chairman Liu Wenhui, and representatives of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, Yang Shisheng and He Jiwu, and has made progress in discussing issues such as stabilizing the Southwest and building self-reliance. It is now learned that Mr. Zhang is scheduled to take office next Monday. Those who will take office at the same time include Deputy Director Qian Dajun and Chief of Staff Xiao Yisu, Secretary-General Xu Siping.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th] Qian Dajun and Xiao Yisu flew from Nanjing to Chongqing at 1:30 PM on the 18th. Xiao said that he came here to attend Director Zhang Qun's inauguration ceremony and would return to Nanjing after the event. Qian and the two went to the official residence together at 4:00 PM to attend Zhang Qun's banquet. Also, Mr. Zhang decided to take office at 10:00 AM on the 21st.</p>
<h3>ECA Aid to China Proposals Can Be Submitted to Congress Next Week; Lapham Will Attend to Explain</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] US Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) Director Hoffman told the Central News Agency reporter today: After Congress concludes its discussion on the European recovery plan, the interim proposals for the aid to China plan will be submitted to Congress. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has concluded this discussion today, but the House Foreign Relations Committee will not be able to complete this work until Thursday of next week at the earliest. The two committees must discuss and prepare for a week before submitting recommendations to Congress. Hoffman said that Lapham will arrive in Washington within ten days and resolve all special issues before the China plan is submitted to Congress, and attend the Congressional Committee to explain the matter. (Gu Weijun requested the ECA to allocate funds to assist Chinese students studying in the United States, see news on page 2)</p>
<h3>There is Still a Chance to Resist the Communist Party</h3>
<p>Hang Beike Advocates Aiding China</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York 18th Broadcast: Former State Department Far East Director Hang Beike said in the Foreign Policy Association: "If the Communist Party controls China, most of Asia will be threatened, and the possibility of us being dragged into a war vortex will also increase. The United States must contain communism in both Europe and Asia at the same time, and China is the best area to start." Columbia University Professor Pei Fo held the opposite view, saying: "If we regard the pitiful government in Guangzhou and Taiwan, where wealthy political refugees are flocking, as another fortress against communism, and waste billions of dollars again, it is extremely dangerous. The situation is so fragmented now, of course there is no need for that." Hang Beike argued: "If China falls into the hands of the Communist Party, the Communist Parties in the south, west, and east of China will inevitably succeed, which is a natural trend. The United States' investments and interests in China, the Philippines, Korea, and Japan will also be greatly threatened at that time, and our allies in East Asia may all be destroyed at that time. If Europe cannot obtain resources and trade from East Asia, the hope of complete recovery will become a bubble. As the power of the Asian Communist Party becomes stronger, the conflict between democratic countries and the Kremlin is more likely to become a 'hot war.' Our various investments in aid to Europe will soon be seized by the Soviet Union. We often hear some unfounded news that the Chinese government is corrupt, incompetent, and hopeless, but we must wake up today and know that the KMT is still preventing the Communist Party from advancing. The area occupied by the CCP so far is less than half of the entire territory of China. The CCP lacks administrative personnel, so although it occupies a lot of land, its rule is actually very fragile. Today, there is at least still a chance to extend the efforts to resist the Communist Party. We should provide moral and material support to this kind of effort to resist the Communist Party."</p>
<h3>CCP Defends Responsibility for Civil War in Broadcasts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco 18th Broadcast: Today, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia CCP Radio Station published a long editorial by the Xinhua News Agency, entitled "Evaluating Several Answers from the KMT Regarding the Issue of Responsibility for the War," which defended the responsibility for the current civil war in China. The article quoted President Chiang, President Sun, and Acting President Li's documents and speeches, and commented on them, believing that the KMT should be responsible for the war. Regarding the government's accusation that the CCP "delayed in appointing representatives," it proved that "because determining the list of war criminals is a major matter, and too many or too few would be unrealistic, it is necessary to consult with various democratic parties and people's groups, so it was 'delayed' for a period of time, and representatives could not be appointed quickly, causing Sun Ke and others to be quite unhappy; but it will not be long before the list of war criminals can be announced, representatives can be appointed, and negotiations can begin. President Sun cannot say that we are superstitious in force."</p>
<p>[United Press, This City News] While the Shanghai Peace Delegation is discussing ways to end the civil war with the CCP in Beiping, the CCP radio station still...</p>
<h3>Xu Kan and Liu Gongyun Visit Acting President Li; Carefully Study Economic Measures; New Plan Still Needs to Be Approved by the Political Affairs Council</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Minister of Finance Xu Kan, President of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun, and Comptroller-General Long Songzhou have been consulting with various parties in Shanghai for days on new economic measures. After completing their official duties, they flew to Nanjing together yesterday morning at 11:00 AM to visit Acting President Li for instructions. The date for the promulgation of the new economic plan is at the beginning of next week. It is heard that the main points of the content include allowing the free and public sale of gold, the daily posting of silver dollar prices, and the stipulation of the legal ratio between gold and silver. In order to stabilize the economy and prices, the southward transportation of gold and silver from the Central Bank in this city will be prohibited, and the sale of US aid materials will be strengthened.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Amidst the news that the new economic plan is about to be promulgated and implemented, Minister of Finance Xu Kan, President of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun, and some key financial and economic officials flew from Shanghai to Nanjing by plane at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th. After Xu and Liu rested briefly after getting off the plane, they visited Acting President Li at 3:30 PM in the afternoon to report on the current financial and economic situation and the price fluctuations in various places, and presented the new economic plan that they had discussed and drafted with various parties in Shanghai to Acting President Li for final instructions. Acting President Li inquired in detail about the current financial and economic situation and made a detailed and careful study of the main points of the new plan, which lasted for an hour, until 4:30 PM, when the two left. It is learned that the new plan still needs to be discussed and approved by the Political Affairs Council before it can be promulgated and implemented. Xu Kan and Liu Gongyun will fly from Nanjing to Guangzhou on the morning of the 19th to present the new economic plan to President Sun for discussion at the Political Affairs Council meeting after seeking instructions in Nanjing on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Xu Kan and Liu Gongyun visited Acting President Li again at 9:00 PM on the evening of the 18th to conduct a careful study of the economic plan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] After Xu Kan visited Acting President Li, he told this newspaper's reporter at He Yingqin's private residence: The new economic plan is indeed under discussion and drafting, but it has not been finalized. When the reporter asked whether it still needs to be approved by the Political Affairs Council, Xu replied: "Of course, of course!" When the reporter asked again whether the free and public trading of gold and silver and the issuance of hard currency were allowed, Xu only smiled and did not answer, and hurriedly said goodbye to the reporter.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 18th] The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has decided to relax the issue of southward transportation of yarn and cloth, but the quantity is still to be decided. Minister Liu Weizhi will go to Shanghai within days. The main task is to discuss opening up the scale of export control in order to strengthen foreign trade.</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Continues to Contact Various Chiefs; Acting President Li Visited Him Yesterday for a Long Talk</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] After Director Yan Xishan returned to Nanjing from a certain place, he continued to have secret talks with Acting President Li, He Yingqin, Xu Yongchang, and others on the 18th. At 10:30 AM on the morning of the 18th, Acting President Li personally visited Mr. Yan at the China Travel Service Capital Hotel and had a long talk for two hours, leaving at 12:30 PM. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, Xu Yongchang visited and talked for a long time. At about 4:00 PM, Mr. Yan visited He Yingqin and discussed with Xu Kan, Liu Gongyun, and others the issue of foreign exchange settlement for Taiyuan's economy and gasoline required for air transport of grain, which also lasted for more than an hour. He also had a long talk with Xu Yongchang in the evening. Those who visited Mr. Yan on the 18th included Zhang Yaoming and He Yaozu. President Yu Youren hosted Mr. Yan at noon and invited Xu Yongchang, Sun Chu, Zhang Yaoming, Sun Weiru, and others to accompany him.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 18th] Yan Xishan's spokesperson today denied rumors that Yan flew to Fenghua last night to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, insisting that Yan did not leave Nanjing. Accuses Acting President Li's peace efforts.</p>
<p>The CCP radio broadcast stated: "The peace measures promulgated by Li Zongren in the past month have shown 'no value,' and Li's orders have not been obeyed." "Some measures announced by Li Zongren to eliminate obstacles to peace have been cancelled by the Executive Yuan." The CCP Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Radio also denounced Li Zongren as "only deceiving the people, while Chiang Kai-shek is pulling the strings behind the scenes." After Li announced his "peace measures," democratic elements were arrested and persecuted the people as before.</p>
<h3>Two Types of CCP Broadcasts; The Content is Not Entirely the Same</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City News] The CCP radio station has two types of broadcasts. One is an English code broadcast, which has been received by the United States stationed in San Francisco for three years. During the height of the civil war, it was often the CCP's only contact with the outside world. The second is a Chinese-language broadcast, but the content of the two is not entirely the same. The Chinese-language broadcast is read at a speed that allows for oral dictation, with each word repeated, so that Chinese newspapers and others who pay attention to listening can accurately record it. In the CCP's Chinese-language broadcast last month, it was requested that Acting President Li detain Chiang Kai-shek sincerely, but this warning was not heard in the English-language report. The recent Chinese-language broadcast has once again attracted attention. The Chinese side believes that the Communist side is willing to ease its demands for war criminals. Another broadcast pointed out that the National Government is unable to seek peace, and that Acting President Li cannot control the government area and is even more powerless. According to the Communist side, "the American master" of the National Government ordered it to try to make a comprehensive peace settlement. Unexpectedly, government officials were "frustrated and disorganized" due to the victory of the Communist army and planned to make a partial resistance. There is also a lot of anti-American material in the Chinese-language broadcast, but not as much as in the English-language broadcast.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Peace Promotion Association Established; Proclaims Five Propositions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 18th] The All-Sichuan People's Peace Promotion Association held its inaugural meeting on the 18th, with the participation of more than 1,000 representatives from 52 people's organizations. Chairman He Zongjie said that the association stands in a purely people's position, aiming to eliminate the scourge of war and promote the realization of true peace. The victory or defeat of war lies in the strength of military force, while the success or failure of a career actually lies in the support of the people. Therefore, the efforts of the people will surely achieve the expected goal. The congress passed three telegrams: a declaration, a telegram to Acting President Li and Mr. Mao Zedong, and a telegram to the people's organizations of all provinces and cities across the country, calling for peace, and proclaimed five propositions: (1) Calling on the KMT and the CCP to cease fire on the spot; (2) Stop malicious propaganda; (3) Both sides stop collecting soldiers' rations; (4) Jointly guarantee human rights; (5) Prepare to convene a national peace promotion association of all parties.</p>
<h3>Zhou Yan Talks About the Guiding Principles for Governing Zhejiang; Public Security is the First Priority; No Troops Will Be Stationed in the Cities and Towns of Various Counties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 18th] This newspaper's reporter drove to the Zhejiang Provincial Garrison Headquarters on Nanping Road on the 18th to visit the newly appointed Provincial Chairman Zhou Yan. Mr. Zhou gave his first official interview with reporters after coming to Zhejiang, humbly saying that he is a soldier and deeply feels the arduousness of the responsibility, but believes that serving his hometown is his bounden duty. He then said: We have learned from the local peace in Beiping, so we must strive for comprehensive peace. Preparing for war is the only way to seek peace. Governing Zhejiang should take public security as the first priority. No troops can be stationed in the cities and towns of various counties. If there are no barracks, temporary camps will be built in the suburbs for stationing. Scattered soldiers and idlers must be suppressed. Hangzhou is still under martial law, so all actions that violate the provisions of martial law, such as strikes and petitions, will be severely punished. All troops stationed in Zhejiang are under my command, so there should be no problem with public security. The reporter then asked whether Chairman Chen's ten-year plan would be continued, to which he replied that he could not talk about it at present.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Public School Teachers and Staff Retain Ren Xianqun</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 18th] After Hangzhou Mayor Ren Xianqun resigned, public school teachers and staff have been retaining him, because he can solve the livelihood problems of public school teachers and staff with a bold spirit. Although Mr. Ren had been at odds with the business community due to increasing the city treasury, he did not apportion to merchants when the large army passed through the territory, so merchants also expressed regret at Mr. Ren's resignation.</p>
<h3>Tell the Truth and Do Practical Things!</h3>
<p>Yan Xunfu Talks About the Guiding Principles of Administration; Determined to Promote Benefits and Eliminate Harm for the People</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 18th] The newly appointed Mayor of Hankou, Yan Xunfu, attended his first press conference this afternoon, breaking away from the official clichés of the past and using a frank and sincere tone to explain his administrative principles, saying: "I don't want to be an official, and I won't mess around, so I don't want to talk about grand plans. But I have the courage to change customs, and I will be responsible for repairing the sewers, reorganizing finances and taxation, so that income is not leaked or disturbed, and expenditures are not inflated or abused, in order to stabilize social order and truly promote benefits and eliminate harm for the people. In short, I want to tell the truth and do practical things, and I will never apply plasters." Mr. Yan believes that nothing is scary, only being unmotivated and unscrupulous. Talking about the current situation, he said: "The situation has developed to this day, not because the Communist Party has three heads and six arms, but because we are not united internally and our will is not unified. At present, if we want to reverse the situation, we must communicate the will of all parties and effectively link up the promising provinces in order to strive for comprehensive peace with a common force." Mr. Yan emphasized that the Communist Party is not scary, what is scary is separatism and division. The actions of Liu Wenhui in Sichuan must be corrected. Finally, Mr. Yan frankly declared that he is determined to condense the strength of all parties with effective methods and firmly believes that unity can be formed.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Mr. Raymond P. McConnell Returns to the US to Report on His Work</h3>
<p>Raymond P. McConnell, Director of the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), returned to the United States to report on his work and departed from Shanghai for the U.S. by plane the day before yesterday. Our newspaper's reporter inquired with the spokesperson of the branch regarding the purpose of Mr. McConnell's return. It was reported that: The main task of this trip is to report on the work of the China Branch to ECA Director Hoffman. The duration of his stay in the United States is currently undetermined. As for whether Mr. McConnell will suggest to Director Hoffman to increase aid to China, they are unable to comment before Mr. McConnell submits his report to Hoffman.</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell's return to the U.S. to report on his work is a routine matter. However, in today's unstable Chinese political situation, whether U.S. aid will continue has become a matter of great concern for the people of the country. Moreover, before Mr. McConnell left China to return to the U.S., he made a trip to Guangzhou to meet with President Sun and Vice President and Foreign Minister Wu, which must have had a significant relationship to the aid policy to China. It is conceivable that Mr. McConnell stated in Guangzhou that he would return to the United States to request the United States to expand its foreign aid program, or extend the current aid to China program beyond March 4th, etc. Although this has been denied by the spokesperson of the China Branch, it is believed that it is not entirely without basis. After Mr. McConnell arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 14th, Finance Minister Xu immediately visited him with Central Bank President Liu to discuss the use of U.S. aid for a long time; at the same time, Ambassador Stuart also came to Shanghai from Nanjing to consult with Mr. McConnell. In addition, General Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, who is tenaciously defending the besieged city, also flew from Taiyuan to Shanghai to visit Mr. McConnell, who was about to return to the U.S., to discuss the issue of airdrops to Taiyuan, and General Yan's defense of Taiyuan has always been valued by the United States. Judging from these various aspects, this trip of Mr. McConnell's return to the U.S. to report on his work carries a considerable mission. Whether or not U.S. aid continues is of concern to the general public, but the universal psychology of the people of the country is to urgently hope that Mr. McConnell can expand U.S. economic aid to China after returning to the U.S.</p>
<p>China is an industrially underdeveloped country. Although it is known as a "country based on agriculture," due to the adherence to old production methods and the lack of improvement, even the farmers, who account for more than 80% of the country's population, are not immune to cold and hunger, and there is no talk of national welfare or people's livelihood. In addition, eight years of resistance against Japan and three years of internal strife have devastated the rural areas, which are the source of food and clothing for the people of the country, completely changing their appearance compared to more than a decade ago. In this situation, for the sake of national revival and economic prosperity, and for the sake of the people's living standards, it is natural to hope that friendly countries can lend a helping hand, and to use this foreign aid as a starting point for economic revival. At the beginning of the victory, the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in China and the continuous aid from the U.S. government to China made the benefited Chinese people grateful for the assistance from friendly countries. Unfortunately, for the past three years, firstly, due to internal obstacles in China, the flames of war spread throughout the country, making it impossible for our people to use foreign aid wisely as capital for revival. Secondly, due to the insufficient amount of foreign aid and the mismatch with the demand for materials, even if there was peace and tranquility in the country, it would be difficult for China to embark on the path of industrialization.</p>
<p>In the past three years, the Chinese people have had a nightmare, and the fluctuating attitude of the United States towards aid to China has been especially bewildering. Today, the situation in the state has undergone tremendous changes. Although the term of the U.S. aid to China program is about to expire, President Truman's message to Congress only mentioned the plan to aid Western European countries, and did not mention a single word about China, which not only greatly disappointed the Chinese people, but also made righteous Chinese friends believe it was unwise. Recently, the American public opinion has been critical of the government's attitude towards this matter, which is evident. In order to clarify the domestic situation, President Truman submitted the second work report of the Economic Cooperation Administration to Congress on the 14th of this month. He said: "We are currently engaged in special efforts to ensure that the supplies of the Economic Cooperation Administration are continuously transported to China, so that the areas controlled by the central government of China and the besieged cities of North China can benefit. For example, the cotton of the Economic Cooperation Administration has enabled the gears of China's largest industry to maintain rotation, to supply important cotton fabrics, which are sold not only in the domestic market of China, but also exported to other countries in the Far East." From this report, it can be seen that President Truman himself cannot help but express considerable optimism about the effectiveness of U.S. aid. Finally, President Truman solemnly declared: "U.S. aid to China must be a supplement to China's own efforts to increase production and supply, and cannot replace China's own efforts." The so-called "Heaven helps those who help themselves," President Truman's words are indeed words of wisdom, and are worthy of deep reflection by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Every kind-hearted Chinese person originally regarded "self-reliance" as a golden rule. However, if there is no assistance from foreign aid and we rely solely on our own strength, then the process of "rejuvenation" will inevitably be delayed. We earnestly hope that the U.S. authorities will take a long-term view, without hesitation, and continue to intensify aid to the suffering Chinese people. We deeply hope that Mr. Raymond P. McConnell can convey the feelings and wishes of the Chinese people to the American government and the public!</p>
<h3>Initial Success of Air Transportation to North China; Da Shanghai Ship Arrives at Qinhuangdao; Four Representatives of the Shipping Industry Scheduled to Fly to Beiping Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The All-China Shipping Industry Federation initiated air transportation to North China.

The four representatives disembarked at 10:30 AM and were scheduled to fly to Beiping by plane in the afternoon. However, it was still unknown last night whether the four representatives had actually departed yesterday afternoon. The Tangshan ship, which sailed to Qinhuangdao after the Da Shanghai ship, is currently docked at buoys 11 and 12 in this city. 30,000 bags of flour have been loaded. It was originally scheduled to depart yesterday, but it has not yet been exported due to unfinished procedures. It is difficult to determine today, but it is likely to be possible tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Communist Side in Beiping Establishes Foreign Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>To Serve as Intermediary Between Foreigners and the Authorities</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping 18th Dispatch] The Communist side has established a Foreign Affairs Bureau here to serve as an intermediary for foreigners to contact the authorities, but it seems that consuls of various countries cannot yet obtain formal recognition. Some foreigners have applied to the bureau to register their cars in the same way as Chinese citizens, but most of them still do not use cars for safety reasons.

<p>Students to Negotiate Death Sentence for Xu Huidong</p>
<p>[United Press Correspondent Jean Beiping 17th Dispatch] (Delayed) The semi-official "People's Daily" continues to attack United Press reporter Musa and the reporter himself. The reason for the attack on the reporter is that the reporter reported on February 5 that all employees of the CCP-taken "Beijing Hotel" received equal wages. The "People's Daily" denounced this as inaccurate.</p>
<p>If this report is indeed inaccurate, then the reporter can point out that this information came from a direct source. At the same time, before the new government establishes some contact with foreign news agencies, we have no way to verify its accuracy.</p>
<p>Obviously, the drafts of telegrams sent by foreign reporters are checked by the telegraph bureau.</p>
<p>The "People's Daily" concluded its news with a statement saying: "There is a very obvious fact, that is, the people of Beiping will not silently endure the slander of reporters."</p>
<p>The newspaper also released another message stating: The Beiping Student Federation demanded that the Military Control Commission ask reporters to make a public apology and expel Musa and the reporter from Beiping.</p>

<h3>Connally Reiterates U.S. Position on Atlantic Pact - Guarantees Assistance Against Any Aggression, U.S. to Retain Initiative on Measures to be Taken</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 17th] President Truman insists on his belief that the proposed North Atlantic Treaty serves as a prior notice and clear evidence that the countries participating in the treaty will unite to resist any armed attack. He reiterated this belief at today's press conference. He first announced it last month in his inaugural address. President Truman declined to answer further questions about the treaty but pointed out that Acheson had consulted with him before holding a press conference on Wednesday, and Acheson and he were in complete agreement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated on the 18th that the Atlantic Treaty would be "worse than useless" without the support of a supermajority in the Senate. This advice has been conveyed to Secretary of State Acheson. Acheson is scheduled to present a brief to the committee on the afternoon of the 18th regarding the U.S. position in the negotiations. Connally told reporters that the strength of this anti-aggression treaty lies in the clear understanding by Western Europe that the United States will firmly support the treaty, which stems from Congress's power to declare war. He stated, "Even if the treaty is approved by the necessary two-thirds majority vote in the Senate, it is still insufficient. Without unanimous support, the treaty may be worse than useless." Connally continued, even if the House does not review the agreement, House support is also essential because the House has the same say in matters of declaring war. Connally also stated that he believes the following two articles in the current Western Hemisphere defense treaty may be compatible with the new European agreement: (1) A prior guarantee that the United States will "assist in dealing with aggression," but with a reservation that the decision on what swift steps the United States should take remains in the hands of the United States. (2) A majority of the contracting states may order steps other than war, such as severing diplomatic relations and suspending trade and transportation. Acheson will likely meet with the ambassadors of Canada, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and other groups involved in the treaty negotiations in the next few days, and he will inform them of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's reaction to the current wording of the treaty.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Canberra, 17th] Australian Opposition Leader Menzies declared today that the anti-communist alliance should not be limited to the North Atlantic but must include South Africa, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Australia, and New Zealand.

<h3>Siam Imposes Martial Law Nationwide - To Prevent Communist Infiltration</h3>
<p>Police Ordered to Inspect News</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bangkok, 17th] Siamese Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram today announced nationwide martial law and ordered the police to inspect news, especially newspapers with pro-communist leanings. Overseas Chinese newspapers will also be inspected. Phibunsongkhram also cited reports from Paris that Chinese Communist Chairman Mao Zedong and Viet Minh leader Ho Chi Minh are now drafting a plan for communist rule over the entire Asia. China and European countries cannot prevent the infiltration of communism, and the Siamese government will take various steps to prevent its people from being infected with pro-communist ideas. Even in wartime, the power of public opinion is stronger than weapons, so the government must control the news. He said this action is for the benefit of all 18 million people in the country.</p>

<h3>U.S. Senator Suggests Revising - Economic Cooperation Administration Regulations</h3>

<h3>Truman Announces - U.S. Policy Toward Japan Unchanged</h3>
<p>Rumors in Tokyo Denied by Royall</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] President Truman today publicly acknowledged the statements of Secretary of State Acheson and Secretary of the Army Royall that the U.S. occupation policy in Japan has not changed. Truman said that rumors that Royall had recently made confidential remarks to six American journalists in Tokyo, stating that the United States would withdraw from Japan in the event of war, had been firmly denied by Royall himself. This is a dispute between Royall and the reporters, not me. Besides restating that U.S. policy remains unchanged, I have nothing more to say.</p>

<h3>Panyushkin Accuses U.S. of Monopolizing Japanese Economy - Preserving Japanese Zaibatsu, U.S. Regrets Soviet Remarks Interpreting U.S. Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Panyushkin today delivered a 2,000-word statement at this week's regular closed meeting of the Far Eastern Commission, criticizing the U.S. plan to assist Japan's economic recovery and demanding that the commission thoroughly investigate it before deciding on a policy. Panyushkin said that the U.S. government's instructions to the Japanese government on December 10 of last year to strictly control prices and wages was a "bypass" of the Far Eastern Commission, a violation of the commission's rules, and an attempt to sacrifice Japan's economic independence to preserve the interests of U.S. monopoly merchants. The policies unilaterally pursued by the U.S. government in Japan are nothing more than an attempt to preserve the major Japanese zaibatsu that participated in the past aggression and to strengthen their power.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] In response to Soviet Ambassador to the United States Panyushkin's criticism of MacArthur's recent decision on the Japanese economy at the Far Eastern Commission, the U.S. State Department released on the evening of the 17th a statement previously made by the U.S. representative at the Far Eastern Commission, which implied the purpose of Panyushkin's measures and expressed regret at Panyushkin's public criticism.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Proposes to Security Council - Candidate for Governor of Trieste</h3>
<p>The West Still Advocates Returning Trieste to Italy</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] Soviet Representative Malik proposed today to the Security Council the appointment of Faruki, former Swiss Ambassador to the Soviet Union, as Governor of Trieste. However, the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France replied that the three governments advocate returning the Port of Trieste to Italy. Faruki was originally on the list nominated by the United Kingdom in 1947, but it was rejected by the Soviet Union at that time. The Soviet Union's expression of agreement this time is too late. In the end, the Security Council adjourned without a vote and did not set a date for the next meeting. The Soviet proposal has little hope of being passed.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bern, 18th] Former Swiss Minister to the Soviet Union Faruki was surprised to read in the newspaper that he had been supported by the Soviet representative to the Security Council as the Governor of Trieste. He said that he had no knowledge of this matter beforehand.</p>

<h3>Labor Strike on Two Railways Resolved - Shanghai-Hangzhou Trains Can Resume Normal Service Today - Petitioning Workers on Shanghai-Hangzhou Line in Jiaxing Have Returned to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The labor strike on the two railways, which has lasted for more than a week, came to an end yesterday morning. The petitioning workers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, after listening to the new treatment of workers on the Beijing-Shanghai line and in Shanghai late the night before, have returned to Hangzhou.

At the beginning of the strike, the employees petitioned for their livelihood, and from a personal standpoint, he expressed deep sympathy. Afterwards, a small number of illegal workers took the opportunity to stir up trouble and incite the labor strike, attempting to use the majority of good workers as tools in order to achieve their conspiracy to disrupt order and cause bloodshed. Fortunately, most of our good employees understand the righteousness, and with the assistance of the police and military department, no bloodshed occurred. Now that the livelihood can be maintained, it is hoped that everyone will stay in their positions and not be used by a small number of illegal elements as a sacrifice.</p>

<h3>Accumulation of Distributed Oil and Coal - Affecting Public Education Life</h3>

However, in addition to rice, sugar, and salt being supplied on time without shortage, coal briquettes have not been distributed for two periods, and edible oil has not been distributed since the December issue of last year (a total of three periods of accumulation). The impact on life is extremely deep and great. It is generally hoped that the authorities can take into account the hardship of public education personnel and promptly supervise the supply committee to instruct the Zhongzhi Oil Factory and the Coal Adjustment Committee, which are responsible for the supply, to resume distribution as soon as possible and not delay any longer. If it is believed that there are indeed difficulties in the supply of goods, the difference in money should be issued immediately according to the retail market price in order to maintain the lives of public education personnel.</p>

<h3>20 Yuan Red Gold Yuan Note - Designs Have Secret Marks - But Different from What is Reported</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency report] Some newspapers in the city previously reported that the design of the 20 yuan red gold yuan note printed by the Central Printing Plant contained the four characters "Zhongzheng Downward," which is not entirely accurate. According to the person in charge of the Central Printing Plant, "The secret marks added to the 20 yuan red gold yuan note printed by our plant are not consistent with what is reported outside. The secret marks on the front of the note are 'Hu·F·Zheng·Hang,' and the secret marks on the back are 'P·F·Zhong·Shang,' etc. All of them were printed after being signed and approved by the central government.

<h3>Contingency Funds for Schools; Allocation Agreed Upon; Professors’ Association Conference Resolves to Request Salary Calculation Based on Index</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal National University Professors’ Association held its third conference yesterday afternoon at Fudan University. Three representatives who had petitioned in Nanjing reported on their trip, and discussions were held regarding the allocation of contingency funds and improvement of compensation. Regarding the contingency funds, of the one hundred million yuan initially allocated by the Executive Yuan, it was decided that 15% would be used for student food reserves in the various national universities. The remaining 85% would be allocated to faculty and staff of the schools, with the allocation ratio determined by the number of personnel in each school. In addition to Jiaotong, Fudan, Tongji, Jinan, Shanghai Business College, Shanghai Medical College, Music Academy, and Wusong Merchant Marine Academy, the Kindergarten Teacher Training Academy and Tangshan Engineering College will also be included in the allocation.</p>
<p>Regarding compensation, prices are now many times what they were on August 19th, but professors are still being paid at 15 times the former rate, resulting in monthly income of only around 2,000 yuan. Although the Executive Yuan has discussed adjusting this to 75 times the former rate, this is still far from reflecting actual prices. In order to fundamentally solve this problem, the conference decided to send a telegram to Acting President Li and the Executive Yuan, requesting that salaries be calculated based on the price index.</p>
<p>The fourth conference of the Professors’ Association is scheduled to be held on the 23rd at Tongji University.</p>
<h3>Tongji Professors’ Association Re-established; Directors and Supervisors Elected Immediately</h3>

However, the deadline for collecting fees is usually set at the beginning of the semester, making it difficult for many impoverished government employees with numerous children to raise the funds. In consideration of this, the deadline for government employees of all bureaus and departments of the municipal government to pay school fees is extended to the end of February. All schools must first admit the students and may not delay or cancel their enrollment on the grounds of delayed payment of fees."</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Cables Headquarters Requesting Troops to Vacate Warehouses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the General Headquarters of the Garrison Command of Nanjing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, and the Garrison Command of Shanghai and Wusong, requesting that they order the troops stationed in the second warehouse of the Litai Enterprise Company to evacuate immediately. The original telegram stated: "In the past two months, the number of troops stationed in Shanghai has increased, and the number of troops passing through has also been continuous. The regulations for troop transit and lodging, as stipulated by the Executive Yuan in June of the 37th year [1948], have not been followed. Instead of setting up tents and camping in the open, schools, factories, merchant warehouses in the suburbs and urban areas, or unfinished private houses, have been occupied. It is common to use water, electricity, and furniture at will, resulting in a chaotic mess. Commercial and industrial operations have been suspended, and school classes have been affected. Various industries have repeatedly appealed to the authorities in two reports, but only a few have complied and vacated the premises, causing great distress. Although the situation is extremely tense, reducing a bit of disturbance in the relatively stable southeast area is of great importance to national unity, public morale, and maintaining local construction. We hope you will take this into consideration. Furthermore, Article 7 of the [Garrison Command's] Public Notice No. 393, dated February 8th, prohibits "forcible occupation of civilian houses" by officers and soldiers of all organizations. The term "civilian houses" is contrasted with public buildings and includes all buildings used for commercial purposes, not just residential houses. The second warehouse of the Litai Enterprise Company is used to store goods deposited by merchants, which is of utmost importance and requires responsible safekeeping. How can anyone other than the warehouse employees be allowed to occupy the premises at will?

<h3>Police Spring Review; More Than 10,000 Participants; Commander-in-Chief Tang and Mayor Wu Deliver Addresses</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Police Bureau's annual review was held at the Hongkou Zhongzheng Park yesterday afternoon. The participants included the First Police Reserve Brigade, three Volunteer Police Brigades, the First Administrative Police Brigade, the First Motor Vehicle Brigade, the Flying Fortress and Armored Vehicle Team, totaling more than 12,000 people. The General Reviewing Officer was Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison Command of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. The accompanying Reviewing Officers were Mayor Wu Guozhen, Chen Daqing, Commander of the Shanghai and Wusong Garrison Command, Yu Shuping, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, and the commanders of the various military units stationed at the port. The review ceremony began at 1:30 PM. First, Zhang Weiren, Chief of the Inspection Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, reported on the participating units and number of personnel. Then, the entire parade and divisional review were conducted, lasting 45 minutes. Commander-in-Chief Tang then addressed all the police officers, saying that he was very pleased to see the serious spirit and orderly ranks of all comrades. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. After eight years of arduous fighting, all unequal treaties were abolished, and Shanghai was completely returned to the motherland from the hands of foreigners. This is the price of eight years of war, and today it is up to our police comrades to protect it. You should demonstrate a high degree of combat spirit to defend Shanghai, which is to fulfill your duty and responsibility, and to be worthy of the comrades who sacrificed in the eight years of war. In the past three years, the Shanghai police have exerted great strength. In the future, all comrades should continue to uphold the spirit of the past three years, and under the leadership of Mayor Wu, Commander Chen, and Director Yu, work together with one heart and one mind to fulfill their responsibility to protect Shanghai and coexist with Shanghai. After Tang's speech, Mayor Wu and Commander Chen delivered separate speeches. Mayor Wu first pointed out two responsibilities: one is the common responsibility, that is, everyone should work together with one heart and one mind to protect Shanghai, and must have the spirit of going through fire and water; the other is the responsibility of himself and Director Yu to all the police officers, that is, how to stabilize their lives. Mayor Wu expressed great concern about the difficult lives of all the police officers, and said that he is making every effort to improve their situation. In addition to the two dou of rice that has been added to each person this month, it has also been decided to add two catties of meat, two catties of oil, and one catty of vegetables per day from the 16th of this month, so as to make the lives of all personnel reasonable, at least to be able to eat their fill and keep warm. He hoped that all police brothers would work hard to fulfill their duties and responsibilities. Commander Chen said that the police are the force for stabilizing society and protecting the people. In the future, he is willing to work with all Shanghai police comrades to jointly fulfill their responsibility to protect Shanghai and serve the people. After the speeches, all the police officers marched from Zhongzheng Park, through North Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, and Xizang Road, to the Great World and disbanded.</p>

<h3>Military and Government Agencies Must Obtain Approval from Ministry of Finance for Overdrafts and Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Ministry of Finance recently informed the National Bank of China that in the future, all overdrafts and loans by military and government agencies must first be approved by the Ministry of Finance, otherwise the National Bank of China may not approve the loans. The National Bank of China has notified its branches in Beijing, Guangzhou, and other places to comply with the instructions after receiving the letter. According to past regulations, overdrafts and loans by military and government agencies were required to be approved by the Ministry of Finance. However, due to the unrest in the past two years, in order to avoid delays in official documents and loss of timeliness, there was an expedient measure allowing various agencies to directly negotiate overdrafts and loans. Recently, in order to save expenses and coordinate allocation, the Ministry of Finance decided to restore the original method to avoid abuses.</p>

<h3>Real Estate Agent Leads to Arrest of Major Thieves; Six Arrested at Qichang Hotel, All Military Personnel; Investigation Reveals Repeated Robberies and Murders; Retelling of Eventful Past</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Real estate agent Tao Jianhua, from Pudong, over forty years old, resides at No. 24, Baokang Lane, Linsen Middle Road. On April 21, 1947, Tao was robbed by six armed bandits, losing gold bars, jewelry, and luxurious clothing, estimated to be worth about 100 taels of gold. The case was reported to the police authorities for investigation, but the criminals were never apprehended. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 PM yesterday, Tao was passing by Daxin Street, Hubei Road, when he suddenly encountered a military-looking man with pockmarks on his face, who seemed familiar. After careful consideration, he suddenly remembered that the military man was one of the six thieves. He followed him to a room on the upper floor of the Qichang Hotel on Hankou Road. Hearing some noise inside the room, he remained calm and went to the Laozha Police Sub-bureau to report. Zhang Kuidong, the chief of the criminal section, ordered Inspector Wang Anbang to lead officers such as Song Jiabao and Tao Jianhua to rush to the hotel in a police car. They saw six military men slowly walking downstairs. After being identified by Tao, the officers stepped forward and took them all to the bureau for interrogation. Three guns were found on the suspects. According to Tao, after the robbery, on August 12th of the same year, two men in military uniform holding handguns suddenly arrived at around 5:00 PM, claiming to have been sent by the First Pacification Command, arbitrarily beating people and destroying furniture before leaving. They repeatedly came to cause trouble. Unable to bear it, he sent a letter to the Pacification Command for inquiry. The reply stated that no one had been sent. It is reported that the group of bandits had robbed eleven fishing families along the coast of Nantong last year. Before leaving, they tied up all the victims and threw them into the sea. At that time, the families of the victims reported to the Garrison Command for investigation. As a result, three accomplices were arrested. However, the ringleader, named Yuan Guoxiang, used the name of the Pacification Command to return the three accomplices to Nantong for release. In the end, he killed all the family members of the victims. Yuan and others remained at large. After learning about this, the Garrison Command issued a warrant for Yuan's arrest, but he was never found. The Garrison Command repeatedly sent people to Tao's residence to inquire about Yuan's whereabouts and asked for assistance, but Tao also did not know his whereabouts. According to the six military men brought to the bureau, their names are Yuan Guoxiang, Yuan Guozhen, Zhuang Bingliang, Geng Huaichen, Lu Quan, and Li Jiabin. Tao also telegraphed the Garrison Command in the police bureau to send an officer to identify Yuan as the wanted criminal. After the sub-bureau asked Director Yu for instructions, he ordered that the original defendants be sent to the Criminal Investigation Section of the General Bureau for interrogation and verification.</p>

<h3>Impoverished Students Exempt from Uniform Fees at Municipal Schools</h3>
<p>Municipal primary and secondary schools have a mandatory requirement for all students to pay uniform fees each semester. However, impoverished students already find it difficult to afford tuition, and the uniform fees are even more burdensome. They have requested the Municipal Education Bureau to waive the fees. The Municipal Education Bureau believes that such uniform fees are originally stipulated by each school itself, so impoverished students who cannot afford to pay the fees can be exempted from making them. Schools should not have a hard rule requiring it.</p>

<h3>Strong Air of Short Selling; Cotton Yarn Prices Drop Across the Board; Weak Market Sentiment in Cloth Market</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is slow, with few interested buyers. Coupled with tight credit and frequent rumors of short selling, new buyers are hesitant, and market sentiment is weak. Prices for all types of yarn have plummeted.</p>
<p>43-count Blue Phoenix opened at 590,000 yuan, the previous day's support level, but due to weak buying interest, many floating orders were sold off in succession, eventually closing at 500,000 yuan, a decrease of 90,000 yuan. Other yarns, such as Tiannv and Jincheng, also showed weakness. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell by 70,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon declined gradually from 440,000 yuan to close at 400,000 yuan, a drop of 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse opened at 350,000 yuan, eventually closing at a low of 300,000 yuan, a decrease of 40,000 yuan from the previous day. Off-market trading was at 320,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse dropped by 50,000 yuan to close at 280,000 yuan. Other Jincheng and Tiannv yarns also closed at low levels. All grades of 16-count and below also declined.</p>
<p>The upward momentum in the cotton cloth market has waned. This is due to tight credit conditions, a saturated market, and the upcoming release of new economic measures, causing great apprehension. Small investors, under pressure to raise funds, have been selling off, leading to a weakened market.</p>
<p>Laba Tong Fine Cloth dropped from 12,550 yuan to close at 12,300 yuan, a decrease of 1,600 yuan. B Longtou Fine Cloth fell by 1,700 yuan to close at 12,000 yuan. Other fine cloths, such as Santao and Da Shuanglong, also followed the downward trend.</p>
<p>Sijunzi Yuan Broadcloth initially opened at 13,000 yuan, and even rose to 13,200 yuan. But news of the decline in Black Red fabric caused the momentum to falter, eventually closing at 12,250 yuan, a decrease of 2,100 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Straight Cloth dropped from 12,700 yuan to close at 12,000 yuan, a decrease of 1,900 yuan. Prices from other cloth factories also opened lower by about 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>China Textile Corporation Yarn Sales</p>
<p>China Textile Corporation sold 13 types of yarn yesterday, with 41 bidders. A total of 96 lots were sold, amounting to 38.81 million yuan.

<h3>Credit Conditions Initially Stable, Then Tight</h3>
<p>Credit conditions in the market were stable yesterday morning. Non-financial institutions generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards future price trends, resulting in a decrease in demand and an abundant supply of funds. Interbank lending rates remained between 70 yuan and 80 yuan per day, equivalent to a monthly rate of over 2%. Credit conditions tightened near noon, with a very frequent turnover.</p>
<p>Cash remained scarce in the market yesterday, due to urgent demand from shipping companies to avoid high exchange rates. The Central Bank of China has issued nearly 5 billion yuan worth of red 100 yuan notes in the past three days, but the reserve funds continue to dry up, and banks are strictly limiting withdrawals, with a premium of about 4%.</p>
<h3>Gold Bond Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>The official exchange rate for short-term gold bonds was set yesterday by the National Bank at 75,000 yuan per tael. A total of 300 taels of gold bonds were sold by the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the Fourth Bank, and the China Trust Bureau in the city.</p>

<h3>Reorganizing US Dollar Bonds</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Formulates Regulations and Submits to the Executive Yuan for Approval</p>
<p>Regarding the measures for reorganizing foreign currency bonds, the Executive Yuan has approved the principles and instructed the Ministry of Finance to formulate specific measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Ministry of Finance has now complied with the order and submitted the "Regulations for Reorganizing US Dollar Bonds of the 38th Year" to the Executive Yuan, which will be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance will issue three types of bonds, namely A, B, and C, to exchange for US dollar bonds for which principal and interest have not yet been paid in the past. 1. Type A bonds will be exchanged for short-term treasury bills of the 36th year of the Republic of China, first and second series. 2. Type B bonds will be exchanged for US dollar bonds of the 37th year of the Republic of China, British pound and US dollar bonds, and the Allied Victory US dollar bonds of the 31st year of the Republic of China. 3. Type C bonds will be exchanged for construction bonds of the 29th year of the Republic of China, first series of US dollar and British pound bonds. All three types of bonds will be exchanged at a one-to-one ratio based on the face value of the bonds. Principal and interest will be paid in US dollars upon maturity. The repayment period will be extended. The total amount of reorganized bonus bonds is over 130 million US dollars.</p>
<h3>Repayment of US Dollar Savings Certificates to Proceed According to Original Regulations</h3>
<p>Regarding the repayment method for US dollar savings certificates, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that payment would be made in Gold Yuan based on the Shanghai designated bank's foreign exchange listed price on October 1, 1947. However, there were no clear regulations on how to handle savings certificates purchased in US dollars on that day. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the Central Bank, stating that the US dollar savings certificates had already been approved by the Executive Yuan to be redeemed according to the Shanghai designated bank's foreign exchange listed price on October 1, 1947. If these savings certificates, which have been exchanged for US dollar drafts, are requested for redemption domestically, they should be handled according to the aforementioned regulations of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit, High Interest Rates in the Black Market; Rice Prices First Rise, Then Fall; Flour, Grains, Oil, and Cakes All Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market first rose and then fell. The initial market saw prices rise due to the excessive increase in household rice prices and public panic. With merchants making efforts to raise prices, they rose at one point. Later, due to tight credit, high black market interest rates, and dealers adopting a wait-and-see attitude with empty positions, the market was ultimately unable to sustain the rise and fell slightly. At closing, top-grade white japonica rice retreated to 10,100 yuan. Other grades of goods slightly caught up with downstream demand. Thin japonica rice was at 10,200 yuan, early rice at 9,900 yuan, special japonica rice at 10,400 yuan, and top-grade white japonica rice in the northern market was fixed, opening at 10,100 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour: The market took a sharp turn downwards due to tight credit and low prices for various goods, causing a weakening of public confidence. In addition, negative news permeated the market, and merchants were eager to sell due to fears of high prices. Initial market sales were good, and merchants struggled, resulting in only a slight drop. Later, with the decline in buyer support and sluggish sales, the market sharply declined. At closing, "Warship" brand flour fell to 3,800 yuan, "Old Car" brand retreated to the 4,000 yuan level, wheat bran dropped by over 10%, and "Fuxin Big Bag" brand flour returned to the 3,000 yuan level.</p>
<p>Grains: Prices fell across the board. Soybean hoarders released large quantities, causing a sharp drop of 20% in broad beans, which were traded at 7,000 yuan. Car beans fell by 2,000 yuan, Pinghu Du beans also fell by over 10%, raw peanuts fell by 10%, Yangzhou raw peanuts retreated to below 20,000 yuan, sesame trading remained active, and market prices generally fell by 1,000 yuan. Sorghum saw little interest, with less than 100 bags traded.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: Prices declined sharply. Soybean oil fell by over 20%, staying at the 40,000 yuan level. Factory prices also closed at 40,000 yuan. Raw oil retreated sharply by 8,000 yuan, with Jiangbei Ji barrels now traded at 45,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil fell below 40,000 yuan, closing at 36,000 yuan. Sesame oil also declined rapidly by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan amidst a wave of selling. Soybean cakes followed the decline by over 5%, with Renji cakes now priced at 3,200 yuan.</p>
<p>Sugar Prices Decline</p>
<p>Sugar prices on the previous day followed the sharp rise and fall of Gold Yuan notes outside the market. The morning market was mostly bullish. Yesterday, as gold prices continued to decline, public confidence weakened significantly. However, due to the repeatedly low exchange rate of Taiwan currency, the support after the rise remained strong. Number 4/5 "Car" white sugar closed at 1,800 yuan, down 300 yuan, and coarse granulated sugar was at 1,750 yuan, also down 300 yuan. Medium granulated sugar and white cotton sugar were not available on the market and were not traded. Prices of other grades generally fell by 300 to 400 yuan.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Weak and Soft</p>
<p>Although tung oil merchants tried to push prices higher in yesterday's market, the market atmosphere was difficult to maintain due to the weakening support overnight, tight positions among colleagues, and the overall decline in goods outside the market. As a result, both white and red tung oil fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and the underlying support remained weak.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market continued to be weak. Credit in the market was slightly looser, but black market interest rates remained between 80 and 90 yuan, placing a heavy burden on traders, who were eager to sell. T-20 grade bright new goods opened at a low price of 500,000 yuan. Amid reports of continued minor declines in gold prices and weak performance of various goods, public confidence was extremely low, and the market was filled with selling pressure. The market continued to decline, closing at 450,000 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, gold prices rebounded after falling, public confidence stabilized slightly, and the market showed some signs of recovery, with asking prices rising by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw silk prices fluctuated with foreign exchange certificates. As black market gold prices continued to decline and artificial silk and cotton yarn prices continued to fall, public confidence did not improve, and the market continued to decline. Top grade opened at 480,000 yuan, finally trading at 470,000 yuan. Other grades such as Chelli Thousand Warp Ordinary and Extra also weakened, and prices declined across the board. The market showed slight signs of recovery in the afternoon, but trading remained sparse, and asking prices for top grade rose slightly by 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The silk and satin market was generally weak with slight fluctuations. Meiya quilts opened at 315,000 yuan. After opening, the market received negative news that foreign gold notes and cotton cloth were declining across the board. Rongzhong's credit conditions varied, public confidence was weak, and short selling dominated. The market returned to low levels, falling to the 300,000 yuan level. Later, there was some buying on the decline, and buying sentiment improved slightly. Prices rebounded after falling, but the overall trend was weak, and the outlook was not promising. The market closed at 306,000 yuan, and prices of other grades generally fell by 15%.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes and Soap Recover at Closing</h3>
<p>The cigarette and soap market continued its downward trend from the previous day immediately after the market opened. The process was influenced by reports that new economic plans would be announced soon and that illegal speculation would be severely cracked down on, causing general public apprehension. Prices of goods outside the market also fell in response, and cigarettes and soap were no exception, following the decline. Interest rates within the market were stable, around 8%. White tin packages fell sharply by 200 yuan, ten-pack British cigarettes also fell by 300 yuan, and prices of other grades generally fell. However, major players took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and prices recovered slightly. "Guben" brand cigarettes returned to 15,100 yuan, balancing with the previous day. Prices of other miscellaneous brands fluctuated, and matches generally fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Transportation Control Committee Statement: Explanation of Oil Price Adjustments</h3>
<p>Regarding the repeated increases in gasoline and diesel prices, the person in charge of the Transportation Control Committee explained that the determination of various oil prices before August 19 of last year was based on the automatic adjustment formula approved by the Executive Yuan in May of last year. New prices were calculated and implemented by the Transportation Control Committee after reporting for record. Since the currency reform on August 19 and the abolition of price controls, various factors determining oil prices, such as exchange rates, indexes, and freight rates, have continued to rise. Therefore, in October of last year, the Executive Yuan instructed the Transportation Control Committee and the US Aid Utilization Committee to jointly form a Petroleum Price Review Committee, with the cooperation of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, to handle the matter. The committee drafted an oil price calculation formula for reference, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The formula stipulates that if the aforementioned factors rise beyond the approved limit, the selling price may be adjusted. Therefore, the adjustment of oil prices is jointly determined by the above three institutions and reported to the Executive Yuan for record, and is not something that the Transportation Control Committee can decide alone.</p>

<h3>Three European Distance Runners Cause a Sensation in the United States; Create Many Great Records</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York] In American indoor track and field competitions, European distance running experts such as Hägg and Hansson have also failed. However, two other Swedes and one Belgian finally got their wish. This was the highlight of American competitions in January of this year.</p>
<p>Sweden's Bergsson and Alton each won twice in three competitions, and Belgium's Leve, who participated in one competition, won once. Leve is the champion of the 5,000-meter race at the World Games. Holland's Slijkhuis trailed by extremely close distances in all competitions, ranking second. Slijkhuis lost to Bergsson in the Philadelphia mile race on January 21, and lost to America's Gehrman again in the Millrose mile race on January 29. However, Gehrman had to go all out, running a time of 4 minutes and 9.5 seconds to defeat Slijkhuis. The achievements of European distance runners are a surprise, because in the past, Europeans ultimately failed because they were not accustomed to wooden tracks or their physical condition was not good.</p>
<p>This month, there were two performances that equaled world records. One was at the Millrose Games, where Duwa of Rhode Island ran the 60-yard dash in 6.1 seconds. However, this is not a major event, and 14 people have previously equaled this record.</p>
<p>Bergsson won the one-mile championship at the Philadelphia Games in 4 minutes and 1 second, and won the 1,000-yard championship in 2 minutes and 14 seconds at the Boston Games on January 22. However, he later became upset due to toothache and a misfortune to his son, so he failed in the one-mile race at the Millrose Games.</p>
<p>Sweden's Alton won the two-mile race at the Philadelphia Games in 9 minutes and 12 seconds, and his time at the Boston Games was 9 minutes and 3.2 seconds, setting a record for the event. In the two-mile race at the Millrose Games, Leve won with a time of 8 minutes and 56.1 seconds, and Alton was second with 8 minutes and 56.6 seconds. In the one-mile race at the New York Games, Slijkhuis and Gehrman both tied with 4 minutes and 9.5 seconds, but Gehrman was clearly ahead at the finish line.</p>
<p>Dillard was the most watched person in various competitions last year, but he is now colorless. Although he can steadily win the hurdles championship, as in 1948, and has equaled the world record, Illiniois's pole vaulting star Rickett had a score of four feet and eight inches at the Poché Games. It is said that he believes he can reach fifteen feet before this season. In history, only one person, that is, Warlmerdam, has vaulted over fifteen feet high. The participation of Europeans in the games obviously has a lot to do with ticket sales. The Philadelphia Games had 10,000 spectators, and the New York Games had 16,000 spectators. The indoor track and field season does not start until the end of January. The results of the main events so far are as follows:</p>
<p>One Mile - Gehrman (USA) 4 minutes 9.5 seconds, Slijkhuis (Netherlands) 4 minutes 9.5 seconds.</p>
<p>Two Miles - Leve (Belgium) 8 minutes 56.1 seconds. Alton (Sweden) 8 minutes 56.6 seconds. One Thousand Yards - Bergsson (Sweden) 2 minutes 14.5 seconds.</p>
<p>Fifty-Yard Hurdles - Dillard (USA) 6.1 seconds, equal world record.</p>
<p>Sixty-Yard Dash - Duwa (USA) 6.1 seconds, equal world record.</p>
<p>Long Jump - Rickett (USA) 14 feet 8 inches.</p>
<p>High Jump - Wesoloski (USA) 6 feet 7 and 3/4 inches.</p>
<p>Six Hundred Yards - Gott (USA) 1 minute 12.5 seconds.</p>
<p>Eight Hundred Eighty Yards - Comfort (USA) 1 minute 54.2 seconds.</p>
<p>Sixty-Yard Hurdles - Dillard (USA) 7.3 seconds.</p>
<p>Thirty-Five Pound Hammer - Fulton (USA) 57 feet 9 and 1/2 inches.</p>
<p>Long Jump - Giles (USA) 22 feet 8 and 2/1 inches.</p>
<p>Sixteen Pound Shot Put - Meyer (USA) 52 feet 2 and 1/2 inches.</p>

<h3>Southern China: A Fortress of Stability: Surveying Yulin Port</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper: Liang Zhi</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Hainan Island, 12th] Hainan’s southern region, isolated overseas and hampered by transportation difficulties, remains largely unfamiliar to people in the mainland. However, the security, military, and political situation of Yulin Port in southern Hainan, along with the local customs and traditions, are truly worth reporting. People in the mainland are also urgently seeking clarity on these issues. Therefore, after on-site observations, the reporter has written a brief and factual account of the situation below for the reference of those generally concerned about the current state of Southern China.</p>
<p>Surrounded by Mountains</p>
<p>Yulin Port in southern Hainan, located in the tropics, enjoys a year-round climate resembling early summer. The scenery is picturesque, the sea is vast, and the skies are expansive. Those who have seen the film "Mermaid of the South China Sea" may be able to imagine the enchanting beauty of this place. Although a few small islands lie to its south, it is essentially China's southernmost national defense frontier, a vital base for land, sea, and air forces, a strategic hub in the southwestern Pacific, and the future political and economic center of Hainan Island. If Hainan Island's restructuring is realized, Yulin will likely become the site of a permanent provincial capital due to its inherent advantages and the seven years of painstaking construction by the Japanese. Yulin's naval docks are surrounded by mountains and water, the harbor is wide and deep, and it can accommodate warships of over 10,000 tons. It currently possesses modern fortress artillery facilities comparable to those of Keelung and Kaohsiung. Especially the eastern and western artillery positions at the harbor entrance are in a very strategic position, resembling the pincers of a crab, overseeing the inner and outer harbors. In times of war, they can be used to close the port at any time. The harbor controls the entire Yulin area, guarding the vanguard of national defense, and is a stable fortress for southern China and the cradle for the future development and construction of a new Hainan.</p>
<p>Beyond the Turmoil</p>
<p>Some have predicted that Yulin Port will be the Hong Kong and the Shanghai of the future. Undoubtedly, in a turbulent and suffering nation, it will stride towards the great era with a heroic and striking posture. Although the island is not yet completely pacified, the Yulin (Sanya Hongsha) area in southern Hainan, and even the area between Ya (County), Teng (Qiao), and Ling (Shui) on the periphery, along the public (rail) road line, can be said to have good security, and the people's lives are relatively stable. Sitting in command here is General Nie Qi, commander of the Hainan Island Fortress. General Nie is a standard military man, dark-skinned and robust, with piercing eyes and a loud voice, instantly recognizable as a resolute, courageous, and skilled fighter. He arrived in Yulin in November of the 37th year and took office.</p>
<p>Prospering Yulin</p>
<p>In recent months, he has concentrated all his efforts on seeking coordination and unity between the party, government, and military, rectifying troop discipline, promoting cooperation between the military and civilians, and striving for progress and development from the stability of the fortress defense area. He also serves as the commander of the Southern District Suppression of this island, adhering to the instructions of Commander Han; coordinating with assigned troops, actively restoring automobile road traffic, and dispatching teams to protect local autumn harvests, so that goods flow smoothly, people have access to food, stabilize prices, stabilize people's livelihoods, and prosper Yulin. Although Yulin Port is not a large city, with a population of just over 20,000 according to statistics from the Yulin Police Station, it is filled with institutions. In addition to the Fortress Headquarters, there is the Sanya Air Force Station and Guard Battalion, the Naval Patrol Office and the Fourth Guard Battalion, the 391st Regiment of the 131st Army Division, police sub-stations, army and navy supply stations, as well as the large-scale Hainan Iron and Steel Bureau (equipped with a Mine Police Corps), the Hainan Railway Administration, the Yaxian County Party Headquarters, the Yulin District Party Headquarters, the Yulin-Asia Salt Field Public Office of the Ministry of Finance, the Fisheries Management Office, the Guangdong Branch, the preparatory office of the Hainan Aquatic Products Company of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Yulin-Asia Agricultural and Forestry Experimental Farm, as well as post offices, telegraph offices, the China Farmers Guangdong and other banks. In terms of culture, there is the Yulin-Asia Middle School, the Iron Mine Elementary School, the Salt Workers' Children's School, the Heping Daily, the Daguang Daily resident office in Sanya, and the Qiongya Communications Branch. Since its official establishment on New Year's Day, the Yulin-Asia Military-Police Joint Inspection Office, which has been organized here by the land, sea, and air forces for a month, has had personnel stationed at each unit of the sea, land, and air forces to assist in the implementation of the following matters: (1) strictly enforce military discipline, (2) thoroughly investigate the population of each district and re-register, (3) inspect passengers on incoming and outgoing ships and aircraft, and regularly set up stations to inspect incoming and outgoing vehicles, (4) strictly prohibit opium and gambling, eliminate spies, and (5) tidy up the city appearance. It is generally believed that southern Yulin will improve daily from now on, and Yulin Port will surely have a new atmosphere in the future.</p>
<p>External Transportation</p>
<p>Hainan Island is isolated overseas, and external transportation is extremely difficult, especially for Yulin Port in the southern part of the island. At present, in addition to the bi-monthly China Airlines flights, there is no regular schedule for ships sailing the Yulin-Haikou-Guangzhou line. The transportation of local products from Yulin to Haikou and Huangliu Beili is mostly reliant on civilian ships. Civil servants and teachers here feel a great headache when they encounter job transfers. It is heard that the Fortress Headquarters recently sent a letter to the Shanghai China Aviation Corporation, requesting that the bi-monthly flights be changed to weekly flights to facilitate the delivery of official documents, which has been agreed to. Recently, BC3C-4 type small aircraft have been reassigned, and an additional weekly flight is being planned. In addition, negotiations are being held with the Shanghai office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to regularly dispatch ships to sail the Hainan-Yulin-Guangzhou line. It is expected that external transportation may see significant improvements.</p>
<p>Salt Field Management</p>
<p>The salt fields in the Yulin-Asia (Sanya) Port area of ​​Southern Hainan are quite impressive. Everywhere you can see fields stretching as far as the eye can see. The salt fields are an indication that salt production here is quite large scale. Since post-war restoration, various salt producers have been struggling to operate. The devastation suffered in the past under the enemy and puppets has gradually been restored, but when the salt fields were repaired during the restoration, it was mostly done in a makeshift manner due to economic constraints. Therefore, according to statistics from the Yulin-Asia Salt Works, salt production here last year was only more than 200,000 dan, which is far from the pre-war annual production of more than 300,000 dan. Last December, the Agricultural Bank also piloted salt loans, so the repair work of the Yulin-Asia salt producers was quite active and full of life. At the beginning of January this year, the Asia branch manager of the salt works led a team to Guangzhou for reassignment. The new branch manager, Wang Dehui, emphasized the increase in production as soon as he took office, setting the highest target for salt production this year at 420,000 dan. The salt industry is very important to the lives of the islanders and is a major source of income. In addition, the salt fields of Yinggehai in the Yaxi district are the most large-scale. During the period of occupation, the Japanese spent years of effort planning. The construction of the project has a basic foundation, and the Japanese originally intended to create the second largest salt field in the world, planning to supply the military and civilian food needs of the Southwest Pacific and their own country. Unfortunately, only one-tenth or two-tenths were built before the Japanese declared an unconditional surrender. After the victory, due to national affairs, successive military operations, and the banditry on the island, the government did not have time to take care of it, resulting in its abandonment, which is truly regrettable. Last spring, Director Song of the Guangzhou Administrative Office sent a team to develop the Yinggehai salt field, led by Commissioner Wu Zhixian and engineering experts Wu Lüzhong and Zhu Shenwen, to Yulin, and then went to Yinggehai to conduct on-site inspections. It is expected to complete the entire project in two to three years. The manpower, machinery, and funding for development are set at 6 million Hong Kong dollars. After the construction is completed, it can produce 30,000 dan of salt per day, and about 3 million dan per year (except during the rainy season). If this great plan can be realized as soon as possible, then the annual salt production will not only be sufficient to supply the national food supply, but also can be used for national defense and military needs, and can be sold to the international market to increase national income. This is of great importance to people's livelihood, national construction, and the future of island development and construction. It is a pity that the development of the salt fields has not yet seen any practical action, which really makes the islanders feel very disappointed.</p>
<p>Fisheries and Aquatic Products</p>
<p>Yulin Port is not only a rich and fertile area, but also a city of fisheries and aquatic products. Most of the people in the southern part of the island rely on it for a living. Although they use traditional methods for fishing and lack scientific technology and new fishing boats, the results are still quite impressive, and it is a major export product of local products every year. Last year, the Fisheries Management Office moved its Guangdong branch from Guangzhou to Hainan and sent new fishing boats to operate. The results have been remarkable over the past year. If it can be actively developed, it is hoped that the largest fishery station in South China can be established, and the future will be limitless. In addition, the Marine Products Company, which has been in preparation here for many years, is said to be officially established recently. It can be predicted that the future of southern Hainan's aquatic products and fisheries will become increasingly developed.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Dredging Committee: Flour Being Divided: Assembly Cables County Government Requesting Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] Here, the sandbars on the river surface are gradually extending outward. Local communities have organized a Dredging Committee and obtained approval from the provincial government to collect additional charges on shipping tickets to fund dredging. At the county assembly meeting on the 16th, assembly member Bu Yulin proposed that the Dredging Committee, in recent years, had only spent money on personnel appointments, and no dredging work had been carried out. Recently, the chairman of the committee, Leng Yuqiu, left Zhenjiang for Shanghai. A few committee members, using the pretext of turbulent times, actually divided up several thousand bags of flour that the committee had accumulated over the years under the guise of "storage." This is a mere formality and is akin to dividing up public property. It should be requested that the county government investigate and order its return by cable. It was decided that, in addition to cabling the county government to investigate and order its return, the handling of dredging funds in the future would be discussed and decided at the sixth general meeting to be held on the first of next month.</p>

However, the Wuxian County Government only agreed to lend 250 shi. The university specially sent Professor Fang Zhenzhong and three students, including Shu Yaoqian, to Zhenjiang on the 16th to appeal to the Provincial Government and the Grain Bureau, but to no avail.
