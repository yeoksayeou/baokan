<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕國務院發言人廿九日宣稱，美國擬與中國共產黨取得一種關係以便行事，但此非承認或贊成中共政權之謂。據國務院方面消息，英美兩國最近曾為兩國領事館應否留駐中共轄境事交換意見，雙方同意應留。美國現在南京，北平，瀋陽及其他中共轄境駐有領事包，在南京并駐有大使館。</p>

<h3>國民黨中執會發表宣言　反對中共赤化中國擾亂世界和平</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州卅日電〕中國國民黨中央招待委員會，卅日發表宣言，反對中國共產黨赤化中國，擾亂世界和平，茲錄宣言全文如下：</p>
<p>本年元旦，蔣總統為期弭戰銷兵，曾發表文告，向中國共產黨提出結束戰事，舉行和議，并申述其主張，在只求國體不致變更，憲政不致推翻，人民自由生活與國家軍隊得有保障，則個人進退，唯以國民之公意是從，旋於一月廿一日毅然聲明身先引退，依據憲法以李副總統代行總統職權，以促成和議之進行。</p>
<p>李代總統代行總統職權以後，即以極端忍辱之苦心，從事於和談途徑之覓取，行政院孫院長原揭　光榮與平等之和平，以其主張不克實現，亦不惜毅然辭職，冀和談之勉可打開，爾後何應欽將軍受命出組新閣，協助李代總統繼續為促成和平而努力，卒賴輿論督促，始於四月一日獲致，雙方代表在北平開始和談，本黨順應民情，在恤任何犧牲，以達成和平之誠意，當為天下所共見。</p>
<p>本黨對和談主張及決議原則五項，曾於四月十八日正式發表，認為今日國是準繩，端在於此，原冀中共能加接納，彼此平心協商，建立永久和平，以慰國民喁之望，不意中共始終迷信武力結束放棄共創陰謀暴力刼奪政權之野心，當我政府代表抵平之後，即提出其最後通牒式之所謂國內和平協定，其內容之八條二十四款，直無異將先烈艱難締造之中華民國，為殘酷無情之處分，根本遠背和談協議之精神，業經李代總統，何院長正式拒絕，同時本黨中央亦經於四月廿日晚發表聲明，本黨絕不能接受此類滅國條件之協定，仍望中共幡然悔悟，雙方下令停戰，再為從長之協議，本黨為國家為人民而忍辱犧牲之苦心，亦當為天下所共諒。乃中共於獲知我政府拒簽此無理協定之後，即悍然不顧一切於四月廿一日發動軍隊，繼續侵略，強行渡江，企圖席捲江南，征服全國。政府為重新部署防綫，作長期抵抗，近不得已，撤守南京，將政府全部遷駐廣州，為國家民族之生存，與中共繼續作戰，以求申張正義，達成真正永久之和平。</p>
<p>本黨茲欲向國內外人士剴切說明者，中國共產黨之和生與成長，實完全不脫其為赤色國際第五縱隊之本色，查其開始成立黨部，即受國外金錢之津貼，以後之一切宣傳與行動，亦無不受命於赤色之國際組織。當民國十三年本黨改組之時，以反對帝國主義侵略，進行國民革命，固曾採行容共之政策，本黨特許中國共產黨員以個人資格加入本黨。且必須遵孫中山先生與第三國際代表越飛先生之聯合聲明，不能於中國進行共產主義之革命，并須於入黨之日，為服從三民主義之宣誓，乃不意中共黨員於加入本黨之後，不斷秘密進行其推動共產主義革命之際化陰謀，為時不久，已為本黨所察覺。至民國十六年北伐軍抵達武漢之後，中共即背叛國民革命，發動農民暴動，以圖推翻國民政府之政權，是為中共確為赤色第五縱隊之第一暴露，本黨自此始與中共決裂。本黨所領導之國民革命，因此乃受一極大之挫折。</p>
<p>爾後，本黨繼續北伐，完成統一，原冀從此告終破壞，以遂行三民主義之建設，不料中共轉以流寇方式，於湘·粵·閩·贛等地，組織蘇維埃政府，執行其殘酷門爭之土地革命，當時無辜人民犧牲生命於此種門爭政策者，以千萬計，嗣為國軍圍剿，乃拼命竄擾於湘·桂·黔·川，而僅獲保留其最後殘部於陜北。中共至是，已窮無所之，又另為一次之陰謀，用抗日號召為煙幕，以燭勳西安事變，卒賴全國民眾之維護蔣委員長，始得還都主政，然後抗戰，準備工作，未至中斷。及廿六年七月，我政府發動抗日戰爭，中共復發表聲明，承認三民主義為中國今日之所需，顧為其澈底實現而奮門，并取銷其蘇維埃政權，放棄土地革命，改編紅軍為第八路軍，接受蔣委員長之指揮，為抗戰而努力。</p>
<p>本黨方以中共從此真能激發其愛國良知，為抵禦強寇，重與本黨合作，寗非國家民族之大幸，乃抗戰後三數年間，本黨即發現中共實假抗戰為護符，而秘密從事於擴充兵力，侵佔地盤，故對日寇則遊而不激佔地盤，故對日寇則遊而不激，對國軍則時為襲擊牽制，倘非政府容忍，顧全大局，抗戰大業豈堪設想。至日寇投降，中共即悍然不理統帥部之指揮，發表其獨自受降之謊謬命令，其又一次聯叛國家之野心已路人共見，其時政府為欲以政治方法解決國內問題，庶能與民休息，從事建設，遂有政治協商會議之召集，經一月之協商，始獲致各黨同繭之結果，而中共於友邦執行調解之際，仍有到處襲擊國軍爭佔地盤之惡劣行動，復藉蘇聯紅軍佔領東北延宕移交旅順，大連及東北鐵路之際，紛派幹部潛赴關外，收編偽軍·土匪，取得日本偽滿俘虜之武裝，發展其東北各地之軍事力量。撫順煤礦工程師張莘夫即於當時為共黨所殺害，國人當尚省憶。今日東北之全面赤化，實為中共處心積慮陰謀之實現，是為中共確為赤色第五縱隊又一次畢露。本黨領導抗日戰爭之成果，至是又為之破壞無餘，以本黨廿餘年來與中共往還之經過，深知中共實為泯滅人性，陰險狠毒之集團，其宣言宣誓皆毫無誠意於其中，而只為愚弄以人蠱惑社會之手段，其傳則昨彼今此，弛張無常，其作風口蜜腹劍，則先甜後辣，信義二字，實非中共字典中之所有，彼輩對於人類更無絲毫同胞親切之情感，為求壟斷政權，即犧牲國家民族以致無數人寳貴之生命，亦非彼輩所計及。蓋彼輩迷信之唯物主義與門爭史觀，實認人類門爭為必然，而以和平為虛幻，故彼黨對於黨外任何政黨或個人，除絕對受其支配宰割，即從無平等合作其支配宰割，即從無平等合作之可能，即同屬其黨員，除絕對為黨奴役，亦從無個人良心理性之自由，以如是思想信仰之政黨，實無時不為人類和平世界安全與個人生命自由之威脅，當其力量未成，或尚可謀短期之暫安，茍其力量坐大，即絕難有安寧之歲月，其外形縱有萬變，其實質統為不易。若毛澤東之所謂新民主主義，若中共對西方人士宣傳，其僅為農民民主政黨者，實皆為一時適應環境之偽裝，所以自元旦蔣表重開和談文告以來，為時四月，中共雖以舉國民意之督促，仍絕不放棄其以武力刼奪政權之野心，甚至於大西洋公約簽訂後，毛澤東公然宣稱，將來世界大戰發生時，將領導中國為蘇聯而作戰，其為虎作倀，甘為侵略國家工具之用心，更已畢露無遺，戰爭罪犯誰屬，又何能逃國內外人士之耳目。</p>
<p>本黨負有保衛中華民國與世界和平之責任，凡遇有足以危害國家民族與世界和平而殘民以逞之任何暴力，必當領導全國人民予以排除，是非自在人心，真理必無失敗，乃本黨萬刼不磨之信念，本黨憑此信念，誓將遵奉三民主義，恪守聯合國憲章，奮門到底，國內外愛好和平寳貴自由之人士，當能認識本黨此次繼續作戰之意義，而予以精神與物質之支援也。中國國民黨中央執行委員會。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　理論與行動</h3>
<p>— 謝幼偉</p>
<p>什麼是理論？第一，理論是觀念，是思想上的事件；第二，理論也是可以是文字語言上的事件。理論的進展，可由思想或觀念而達於文字或語言。但超出了文字語言的界域，理論便不復成其為理論。理論止於文字語言的表達。文字語言是理論進展的限度。越此便是行動的範圍，而不是理論。自然，如我們根據一種知行合一的學說，這種區別固不存在。因為不惟文字語言可以算是行動，即思想在某一意義上也可以算是行動。不過，這裏的區別就是常識上說的。就常識上來說，我們不能不承認思想及文字語言尚是理論的範圍。所以任何主張或計劃只要他尚停留在思想或文字語言的階段上，我們即視之為理論。這樣，理論的一種主要特徵就是平安。理論是平安的，是沒有危險的。普通所謂「危險的理論」，這決不是理論本身的危險，決不是理論尚是理論時的危險，而是理論變為行動時的危險。危險在行動上，而不在理論上。就理論來論理論，理論始終是平安的。譬如有人提出一套推翻政府的理論。設沒有人把這種理論變為行動，則這種理論的本身也並不危險。故任何狂妄的理論或或虛偽的理論，在不變為行動的條件上，它是沒有危險的。蓋理論雖可以修改現狀或推翻現狀為目標，然其本身不就是現狀的修改或推翻。現狀是不受理論本身的影響。理論只是行動的先聲，只是行動的指南或計劃。他只代表一種行動的可能性，卻不就是行動的現實性。他可以變為行動，但不是必然的。理論本身實沒有變為行動的必然性。沒有變為行動的必然性，則一切理論，不管怎樣虛偽或狂妄，自其不變為行動言，總是平安的。對於虛偽的理論，我們　無所戄。理論本身，不會害人，更不會殺人。害人或殺人的是行動，是實際的行動。一變為行動時，則一切理論，即是最正確的，也有危險，也不平安。這種危險自行動而來，我們得轉而論究所謂行動。</p>
<p>什麼是行動？第一，行動是身體外表狀態的改變；第二，行動國也是身體以外各種環境狀態的改變。行動的發展，是由身體本身的運動開始，進而引起四周環境的行動。這種運動，自其發源處來說，我們是多少有控制的力量的。不談意志自由與否的問題，我們總得承認，凡是常態的人類，都有力量控制其手足的活動。強迫狀態不存時，常態的人類是能自由運動其手足的。不過，手足活動以後，環境的活動與否，其活動的程度，及其活動的範圍，便大部分不在人力控制的範圍。人力可引起其自身的運動，但不一定能引起環境的運動。即能引起環境的運動，而這種運動也不一定就是行動者自身所預料或所需要的。運動發生以後，運動的後果，一部分可預料，大部分不能預料，一部分可控制，大部分不能控制。從廣島上空投下了一枚原子彈，這種行動的後果是什麼呢？當時的投彈者或命令者，也許能預料到廣島的毀滅及日本的投降，但他能預料到目前的狀況嗎？他能控制目前的狀況嗎？任何行動，我們都無法完全預測其後果，也無法完全控制其後果。我們的預料，我們的控制，都有一定的限度。超過了一定的限度，雖自然科學家在實驗室真的行動，也有不可預測，不可控制的成分在。原子能的實驗者在實驗室裏的行動，便是一個好例證。愛因斯坦已在懊悔他的發明了！這樣看來，行動的一種主要特徵，即恰恰和理論相反，就是不平安。行動是不平安的，是極多危險的。行動的危險，一在行動的障礙過多，我們不能一一預測及控制其障礙。二在行動的影響過廣，不論在時間上或穿間上，都可擴展到無窮盡的境界，因而我們更無法加以預測和控制。縱我們自認為極安全的行動，有時了可發生危險的後果。例如，我有黃金一兩。我把它換為金圓券後，我即用以購買物資。我這種行動，自我個人看來，實在看不出有何危險。然而我一人這樣做，第二人，第三人，以至全上海，全中國的人都這樣做，都把由黃金或外幣換來的金圓券變為物資危險便立即發生。最近的經濟危避，可說一部分是這樣的行動造成的。這是我個人意料所及嗎？又是我個人所能控制其影響嗎？這充分表明了任何行動的危險性。</p>
<p>以上簡略說明了理論和行動的一種主要特徵。因為理論是平安的，所以對於理論，我們可隨便些，放任些，或自由些。在理論的階段上，一切理論都可任意提出，任意發表，任意流行。雖我們覺得是最荒謬或最虛偽的理論，我們也不妨加以考慮。我們所考慮的理論愈多，一種正確理論的構成，即愈有可能。行動不然。因為行動是危險的，所以對於行動，我們得非常謹慎，不能太過放任或太過自由。特別是政府關於政治經濟上的行動，更應十二分謹慎。它的危險，比任何行動都來得危險。它的錯誤是全國人民生命財產之所關。它是不容許有錯誤的。古人所謂「一失足成千古恨」，行動的錯誤，不一定是另一種行動所能挽救的。因而，當政府採取任何政治經濟的行動前，它得有長時間的考慮，得有非常周密的考慮，也得先行徵求各種理論以供行動的參考。這樣做時，縱不能完全避免行動的危險，至低限度，卻可減少行動的危險性。這樣做時，政府行動，縱仍有錯誤，他也較能獲得全國人民的諒解。這是一切行動都應採取的步驟，特別是政府行動所應採取的步驟。不這樣做，不經過這樣的步驟，這種行動便是輕率的，便過份忽視了行動的危險性。依此而論，政府這一次所采取的經濟行動，我們可以批評的是，行動輕率，過份忽視了行動的危險性。缘政府這一次的行動，並沒有經過立法院的檢討，沒有博採各方的理論，卻以緊急處分令出之的。這是我們可以批評政府之處。</p>
<p>不過，我們雖可以批評政府行動輕率，或批評其理論錯誤，然而我們卻須注意很重要的兩點。第一點是行動本身無法避免的危險。這就是說，政府行動也許是對的，只是遭遇了無法避免的障礙或危險。這是我們唯一可以原諒政府之處。第二點是，我們對於政府的批評不一定是正確的。我們的批評，我們的建議，在沒有變為行動前，都是理論。我們的理論，在未受行動的考驗前，也都有錯誤的可能。現在政府居然採取了批評家一部分的理論，又見諸行動了。這種修改式的或糾正式的行動，是否可以成功或絕無危險呢？這自然要待以後的事實去證明。這裏可以說的是，困難或危險決難完全避免。我們馬上又會起而批評政府的行動，這是可以斷言的。理論家始終站在安全的地位，行動家始終站在危險的地位。這是理論和行動的主要差異。這雖免不了政府行動錯誤的責任，這卻可使我們對這一次的經濟變動有較明瞭或較公正的認識。</p>
<h3>蘇提解除柏林封鎖條件　美蘇初步會談進展　外長會可能於五月杪召開</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約三十日電〕美駐聯合國代表團發言人昨夜在美代表傑塞普與英代表馬立克會商後宣佈，兩國代表會商，進展極為滿意。發言人又稱，英美法蘇四國代表決將傑塞普與馬立克之會商經過，報告各該國政府。會商之問題為何，發言人並未透露。傑塞普廿九日離此間赴華府，向國務卿艾契遜提出詳細報告。該發言人力稱，此次會商係初步性質，以便雙方獲悉建議之正確內容，而決定該項建議能否接受。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約三十日電〕蘇聯與西方國家對於成立解除柏林封鎖之協議，今日進展甚慢。西方國家代表認為此際尚不能過於樂觀，但相信蘇方之建議尚合情理。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿九日電〕美代表傑塞普今日應蘇代表馬立克之約，至蘇聯代表團辦事處舉行第五次談話，討論柏林封鎖解放事宜，歷兩小時半，其結果尚未宣佈，惟見傑氏辭出時笑容滿面。傑氏現擬向國務院報告，然後會見英法代表。傑氏稱，是否須與蘇聯代表再舉行一次談話尚未定。據消息靈通方面所知，馬立克對於美方所詢蘇聯願於任何時並在何種條件下之解除柏林封鎖，已提出覆文。馬氏並建議四國外長會議應在五月廿五日左右在巴黎舉行，討論全部柏林問題。此外並悉，馬氏今晨曾在聯大綜合委員會突然提議本屆大會於五月十八日結束，以便主要各團代表能有一星期之餘暇，赴巴黎出席廿五日之會議。四國外長會議現在唯一障礙，即為如何擬訂議程。</p>
<h3>英美兩國對德政策　希望德完成統一　貝文接獲美蘇會談報告</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿九日電〕「紐約時報」今日載成功湖可靠消息稱，四國外長會議如恢復，英美將建議德境蘇聯佔領區與西德合併成為統一國家。此種建議之作用，在使蘇聯策略無所施其技。惟法國尚未表示同意。美國並擬建議大事裁減兵力，惟不贊成蘇聯主張撤退全部佔領軍。成功湖英美代表團發言人對於「紐約時報」上項消息，謂並無所知，如有此種建議亦須在華盛頓或倫敦方面擬訂之。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕就紐約來報告觀，使倫敦方面對柏林封鎖之得以迅速解除，繼之以召開外長會議以討論德國問題，產生了極大希望。貝文外相頃接英出席聯大首席代表麥克尼爾所遞來關於渠於週三與蘇外次葛羅米柯討論柏林問題後之報告。贝文此次亦已接獲英駐安理會代表賈德幹就美蘇兩代表傑塞普與馬立克討論柏林問題經過之報告。此等報告顯示蘇聯對於解除柏林封鎖問題，已採取婉轉的態度。據關係方面透露，關於解放封鎖及召開外長會之確期尚未確定，但外長會召開之日期當不出五月。然另據某權威方面表示，解放柏林封鎖努力之再遭波折，亦並非不可能，英國尤特別注意蘇聯之是否有阻礙西德政府成立之企圖</p>
<h3>西德國計劃　決如期進行</h3>
<p>〔路透社法蘭克福廿九日電〕英美軍事總督頃告西德英美區各邦總理稱，不論有無新的四強會議，西德國仍擬如期建立。</p>
<h3>莫斯科審愼　對柏林問題談判　蘇各報只字不提</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿九日電〕蘇聯方面今日對於解除柏林封鎖及恢複四國外長會議事，態度非常審慎。莫斯科各報對於此種消息只字不提已兩日。美總統杜魯門所謂蘇聯具有誠意之言論，甚為此間所樂聞。柏林僵局之打開，足以改善蘇聯與西方各國間關系。此間確有希望，且有相當信念。據某中立國大使稱，「我仍相信政治家手腕，我仍相信國際和睦可由政治家手腕促成之。雙方皆有政治家，在現行局勢之下，無事不可能，此或為舉世期望之轉機。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦三十日電〕莫斯科電台今日廣播「眞理報」勞動節社論，指責英美戰爭販子已擬就制霸世界之瘋狂計劃，但決不能成功。蘇聯與英美人民之友誼，乃永久和平最佳保障。同時據莫斯科訊，蘇聯人士對於解除柏林封鎖之可能性，態度極為保留</p>
<h3>蘇重視英聯邦會議　認太平洋公約在醞釀中</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿九日電〕蘇聯紅星報今日稱，倫敦之自治領總理會議，為在英國領導下設立太平洋公約之重要一步，目的在使太平洋或印度洋國家得以包括在美英法荷諸國之系統以內，日本可能亦參加此一制度。現太平洋區及印度洋區諸國人民已更積極的參加和平運動，相信大西洋公約及附屬該約的其他制度必將遭遇失敗。</p>
<p>〔聯合計倫敦廿九日電〕巴基斯坦總理艾利幹宜稱，英自治領總理會議結果，並不影響巴基斯坦總在英聯邦中之地位，但巴基斯擔當保留隨時脫離聯邦之權利。</p>
<h3>克萊將辭職　向德人臨別致辭</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社法蘭克福廿九日電〕美駐德佔領軍司令克萊將軍，今日向英美雙佔區之部長會議主席發表告別辭稱，即使蘇聯解除柏林封鎖，空運工作仍將繼續進行。克萊又謂，盟國決不使已往柏林之危險情形於日後重演。西德目下所有之機構，在日後成立聯邦政府能取代以前，仍將繼續存在。克萊謂，德國人民工作甚力，且極富技術研究之天才，彼對德人之良好紀律亦加稱頌。白裏門參議會主席凱撒代表英美區各同僚致答，對克萊在德之成就，極為稱謝。按克萊將於最近辭職。</p>
<h3>處理前義屬殖民地　英美提出新建議　蘇主張聯大會早日結束</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦卅日電〕消息靈通方面息，英美將向聯在政委會提出決議案，授權聯大准許裏比亞在十年後獨立，在十年之內英國將為西倫尼加之托管者，另由英美法義埃組織委員會，決定裏比亞除西倫尼加外其他部份之托管者，然後向今年九月之聯大提出報告。</p>
<p>英美就義殖民地提出之整個計劃並建議由義大利為義屬索瑪裏蘭之托管者，伊裏特裏亞之西部劃歸英埃蘇丹，其餘部份劃歸阿比西尼亞。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社弗魯興廿九日電〕代表馬立克對政委會辯論前議殖民地工作之進行緩慢，提出抗議，謂討論之延緩，乃各個還願解決此問題之國家故意造成，彼等且希望放棄對西班牙及印尼問題之辯論。馬立克建議聯大會應在五月十八日閉會。</p>
<h3>設國際警衛隊案　交由特委會研究</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社弗魯興廿九日電〕聯合國大會今日決定組織十四個會員國之特委會，包括中，蘇，美，英，法在內，以研究賴伊秘書長建立八百名聊合國警衛隊之提議。警衛隊旨在保護並在技術上協助聯合國各委會。上述特委會之組織，以四十七票對六票通過，一國專權。蘇聯波蘭及南斯拉夫反對該提議，以為聯合國憲章規定任何國際性之警衛隊，應置於安理會管理之下，故該提議與憲章實有抵觸。</p>
<h3>郭沫若等一行　經莫斯科返國</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科三十日電〕參加世界和平大會之中國代表團，廿九日夜抵達此間，該代表團由郭沫若率領，係取道此間近國者。</p>
<h3>哈裏曼促批準　大西洋公約</h3>
<p>出席參院外委會作證</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕馬歇爾方案歐洲巡察使哈裏曼，今日在參院外委會就大西洋公約事作證，表示大西洋公約成立後，自由人民將團結一致以維護自由，故西歐人民的信仰已較前更為增加。此時美國若拂袖不顧，誠還知能否重新恢復此項精神。歐洲人民反搞暴力的潮流，今又趨於澎湃，苟不如此，則共黨可能已在義大利獲得勝利，法國共黨亦可能控制政府。</p>
<p>〔路透社渥太華三十日電〕加拿大參院已於昨日一致通過批准北大西洋公約。加眾院將於週內開始辯論此約。</p>
<h3>奎松夫人之死　係遭土匪殺害</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三十日廣播：曾為奎松夫人之保鏢·刻在加利福尼亞大學研究警察學之馬尼拉警監喬斯告記者稱：奎松夫人等係被土匪而非遊擊隊所殺。據稱，奎松夫人乃貴族婦女，平日不拘禮節，國人包括遊擊隊在內，對渠均有好感。</p>
<h3>印荷談判獲進展　原則同意印還都日惹</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞三十日電〕據悉，荷蘭與印尼代表在聯合國委會主持下舉行非正式會談，已在原則上同意共和國政府之還都日惹。現聯合國委會已開始處理其他糾紛之點，如共和國政府所行使全權之程度，及荷方所要求共和國之遵守停戰令，及在海牙召開圓桌會之日期等。共和國要求恢復充份主權之行使，惟荷方則認共和國所行使之主權，祇能與現有之印尼聯邦國相同。現聯合國委會正在設法折沖中。</p>
<h3>西歐十國外長　週二召開會議</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕歐洲委員會十創立國之大使，今日在英外交部內舉行會談，籌備五月三十日十國外長會議之召開。十國大使前已擬具歐洲委員會之章程，僅餘若干懸題，尚待外長解決·關係方面預料俟外長會議通過最後章程後，即可於八月或九月在斯特拉斯堡召開歐洲委員會之第一屆會議。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾發出　競選戰信號</h3>
<p>揭　保守黨四點計劃</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕英保守黨領袖邱吉爾今在倫敦亞爾培廳之櫻花同盟之大會中，向其六千餘名親信，發出競選戰爭的信號。渠云，吾人現已進入決定性的一年，將產生最值得注意的競選戰事，保守黨前途甚可樂觀，但猶須每一保守黨員之從事最大努力。邱翁指出人民對於工黨的國營計劃，均感惴惴不安，故工黨自覺亦無獲勝把握。最近工黨副首相莫理遜之暗示選民如選舉工黨以外之他黨工人將有表示，即為工黨領袖已無信心之表示，此係表示工黨已逐漸接近失敗及工黨之罔顧政治自由的基礎。保守黨副領袖提出保守黨之四點計劃　，（一）減少政府支出以資減少捐稅；（二）停止國營計劃，（三）發動鼓動生產計劃，（四）恢復維多利亞時代之節儉風氣，蓋此乃英國國家財富之基礎。</p>
<h3>今日五一節　日勞工團體遊行</h3>

<h3>計薪指數首次發表　為三七一三四四倍　當局決定發工資兩項措施</h3>
<p>〔本報讯〕上海市職工生活指數編制審議委員會於昨日上午十時在市府會議室举行例會，出席市府统计长褚一飛，社會局長曹沛滋，劳工处長沈鼎，市商會嚴諤聲，總工會方如升·葉翔皋·孫文元·仇長江，工業會田和卿·劉慶一·歐陽侖·金潤庠等。首由主席褚一飛報告本期職工生活費指數，由勞資評斷會建議，經市政會議通過，採用以本期物資最高三日之平均數作為計薪指數。當經決定固定基期指數，環比指數及計薪指數三種如後：</p>
<p>（一）固定基斯指數以卅八年正月上半月四八·〇四倍為基期，總指數及分類指數如次：</p>
<p>總指數：四九〇九·三七（為八一九基價之二三五八四六倍）</p>
<p>分類指數：</p>
<p>食物類　五二六六·六一</p>
<p>衣着類　四二一一·七〇</p>
<p>水電燃料住屋類　五〇九一·五八</p>
<p>雜項類　三〇三四·五〇</p>
<p>（二）環比指數（即本期對前期之比較）</p>
<p>總指數：一五·五八</p>
<p>分類指數：</p>
<p>食物類　一五·〇四</p>
<p>衣着類　一六·九四</p>
<p>水電燃料住屋類　一八·〇一</p>
<p>雜項類　一二·四〇</p>
<p>（三）計薪指數（即按本期物價最高三日之平均物價）總指數及分類指數如次：</p>
<p>總指數：七七二九·九〇（為八一九基價三七一三四四倍）</p>
<p>分類指數：</p>
<p>食物類　八二五四·五四</p>
<p>衣着類　七〇四〇·八三</p>
<p>水電燃料住屋類　七九七八·二二</p>
<p>雜項類　四七四六·三〇</p>
<p>以上各項數字，經各委員縝密審查，通過簽字。</p>
<p>又市政當局有鑒於日來各項物價至為混亂，曾有本期職工生活費指數暫不發表之臨時緊急措施。旋因各廠商職工底薪各有差別，結算頗有困難，經市府於行後會同關係機關，妥慎研商結果，決定四月份下期職工生活費指數，仍按昨晨十時舉行之指數編制審議會開會通過之結果，照常發表。</p>
<p>國行應折發銀元四十萬枚</p>
<p>此外復經決定發放工資兩項措施如後：（一）為穩定物價及安定工人生活起見，國行應撥發各工廠工資及現鈔一萬六千億元，以銀元折發，每一銀元作價金圓券四百萬元，每日撥銀元十萬元。其拆發手續由工廠往來行莊開發國行支票，分四日由工廠及工業會用背書，限四月卅日至五月四日（按一日為星期日）辦完。（二）各工廠工會工資，得依第一條各銀元作價之標準，每一工人先行折發銀元一枚。其餘工資由工廠於四月卅日以後四日內，另以實物或鈔券補充之。</p>

<h3>市長盃男女組決賽　綠隊逢鷹隊·華聯戰回力　另增友賽大公與滬警對壘</h3>
<p>市長盃籃球，今晚續有男女組四強循環決賽各一場外，主辦當局另於兩場之間，增排插曲一場，由大公與滬警作友誼賽，共計三場，自下午四時半開始（夏令時間）門券樓上廿萬，樓下四十萬，及場內對號八十萬三種，對號券上午十時起在市體育館預售，其餘則自一時起發售。球場大門三時開放，並請四維童子軍維持球場秩序，今日節目先錄如下：</p>
<p>綠隊—鷹隊（女決）四時卅分</p>
<p>大公—滬警（友誼）五時一刻</p>
<p>華聯—回力（男決）六時一刻</p>
<p>首仗女決綠隊對鷹隊，前者女籃盟主，近又第四度蟬聯聯賽冠軍，聲勢實力，煊赫充沛，對於市長盃具席箞之意，今晚出戰，自不肯稍有鬆懈；鷹隊雖係新軍，但在王珊之主持下，球藝亦頗有可觀，麾將楊淑君驃悍異常唰時乍逢大敵，全力周旋，當有精彩之演出。</p>
<p>次幕大賽大公戰滬警，兩隊同屬滬上籃球勁旅，大公本屆聯賽未及參加，而於市長盃淘汰賽中，又不幸遭回力毒手，致未有機會與滬警一較高下，舉行友誼，當中球迷之　，而演出精彩可預期也。</p>
<p>壓軸男組決賽，華聯相逢回力，前者男籃老盟主，風度不凡，決賽初戰，雖遇仁餘頑抗，受到嚴重威脅，但能鎮靜不亂，於最後時間內使大局反側，終造勝利。回力球藝蒸蒸日上，壓倒大公，晉升四強，難能可貴，田王趙三劍客外，尚氏昆促及虞鼎厚單，均如生龍活虎，雖於決賽中曾敗於滬警，今又大敵當前，但振奮力戰，事非不可為也。</p>
<p>乙組乒乓聯賽　今有八場角逐</p>
<p>乒乓聯賽乙二部，滬警因出勤關系，不克繼續比賽，函當局聲明退出，該隊已賽各場，積分不計，今晚對星火之戰，亦告取消，今日自上午九時起，共有乙組八場角逐，分在精分郵務兩球室舉行，乙二帆聲對崇本將有劇戰。乙一紅白可勝叔蘋，但必敗於淩雲。乙三星光上屆丙組冠軍，實力甚強，冠生經緯難與抗衡，恐遭毒手。鐵馬四戰四北，精神殊佳，與天翔對壘，仍非敵手。頤中多小型球健將，在乒乓桌上，恐將為育才所窘，金門三逢勁旅，今向郵三討教，</p>
<h3>甲組足球賽　五對零　龍頭勝羣力</h3>
<p>足球甲組聯賽第二循環，昨日下午三時半，羣力再鬥龍頭於逸園球場，觀眾未見擁擠，裁判何春暉，巡邊李國義張志江。兩軍對陣，羣力人馬不齊，十人應戰，開賽後羣力先攻遇阻而回。未幾龍頭左路與兵直撲，敵前金根遞送，姜琨小姜再傳徐護民拉門，洗伯銘救駕有功，未曾失守。八分鍾時，羣力再起，趙振輝於離門卅码处力射，闵承宽从容接住，嗣后战局黏着，至廿分鍾時，羣力林紹钧得球，反傳洗伯銘，一個失守，姜琨乘機打入空門，首開紀錄。旋兩軍火爆演出，鄭秉彝踢法粗魯，周炳榮亦受警告。至卅四分鍾後，徐護民建功，龍頭二比零佔先著，至四十二分鍾，薑琨阮郎再度，三對零結束上半時。</p>
<p>易陣再戰，戰局仍緊張，雙方舉動無改善，羣力趙振輝又受警告，十分鍾後，夏樹福進攻接濟王步榮，步榮射門，為洗伯銘撲出未遠，薑琨候著湊上一腳，送入綱內，成四比零。廿七分鍾時，龍頭又獲機會，前鋒挺進，陳勤右邊吊中，薑琨帶球疾衛，一齊入網。五對零羣力束手受擒。再越十分鍾，龍頭後衛犯規，被判十二碼，羣力陳龍泉主罰，一蹴中閆承寬身上彈回，良機坐失，嗣雖再謀挽回，無奈師殘氣衰，終難收效，結果羣力淨輸五球，再敗龍頭。</p>
<p>龍頭</p>
<p>閔承寬</p>
<p>鄭秉彝　李承先</p>
<p>吳凱敏　王寶山　史大法</p>
<p>王步葵下　張金根　姜琨上　徐護民上　夏樹福下　陳勤　姚慶升</p>

<h3>勞動節民主盃賽　中藝與螢光對壘</h3>
<p>優待勞工開放參觀</p>
<p>今日中藝與螢光之民主盃足球賽，如天氣放晴，決於下午三時半在南市球場照常舉行，裁判員徐國梁，巡邊林　康·朱粹忠。因今日為勞動節，為優待勞工起見，開放參觀，如天時反常，可電話（〇二）七〇七四六詢問。</p>

The price of Big Head silver dollars has jumped to nearly 1.32 million. Shanghai newspapers have stopped arriving in Hangzhou today. Responsible persons from the Hangzhou Southeast Daily News, Zhengbao, and other newspaper offices have left. Employees are cooperating to publish newspapers to maintain their livelihoods.

<h3>Communist Army West of Kunshan Blocked; Taicang Peaceful, Business as Usual</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Our City Dispatch] Military News: (1) Several thousand bandits who infiltrated the area west of Zhengyi Station are currently being blocked in the area 20 *li* west of Kunshan under the close supervision of the National Army.

(2) A portion of the Suzhou bandits' 29th Army, with an artillery battalion attached, moved east along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway on the afternoon of the 29th. (3) Taicang is peaceful, and business is as usual. Scattered bandits in the Zhitang and Zhizhitang area are being suppressed by our forces. (4) The bandits are forcibly conscripting people into the army in northern Jiangsu, arousing public outrage. People are rising up in collective resistance to violence. Although the bandits are suppressing them with extremely cruel means, this great public force is not being subdued.

<p>[Central News Agency, Our City Dispatch] Military Official's Message at 10:00 PM on the 30th: (1) On the night of the 29th, the bandits' 29th Army, attacking east from Suzhou, attacked Shipai Town northwest of Kunshan and Tongli east of Wujiang in separate columns. After being severely hit by the National Army, they suffered heavy losses and withdrew, and have not taken any action since. (2) After the bandits captured Wuxing, they continued to flee eastward, attempting to encroach upon Jiaxing. They were stopped by our army near Nanxun. Their morale is low, and many are fleeing. (3) Jiaxing is heavily guarded by our troops and is peaceful as always. Traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is smooth and order along the way is very good. (4) The Wujiang-Pingwang section of the Sujia Line is still held by the National Army. If the bandits risk attacking, they will suffer a major blow. (5) According to the confession of captured bandits, squad and platoon-level cadres of the 86th and 91st Divisions: they all came from farming families. They abandoned their wives and children and were coerced into joining the army by the bandits. They have long wanted to escape, but the bandits' political workers are monitoring them very closely, making it impossible to leave. Now the bandits' army is surrounded by crises. Officers and soldiers are very disloyal. They hope that the Central Government will rescue them. If the war is prolonged, the bandits' army will inevitably disintegrate.</p>

<h3>Overall Situation May Improve Starting Next Year; Taiwan as a Base for Revival; Chen Cheng's Remarks to Provincial Leaders in Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 30th] Chen Cheng convened a symposium with over two hundred leaders from party, government, military, people's organizations, and middle school principals at 9:00 AM on the 30th. Chen first reported on his impressions of his recent tour of Penghu and the southern counties, saying that Penghu, which is barren, is gradually being enriched. As for the southern counties, those in charge of administration still have a bureaucratic style, glossing over things, and making excuses about lacking funds to shirk responsibility for everything that needs to be done. He expressed his determination to improve administrative efficiency, simplify procedures, cultivate a spirit of law-abidingness, authorize local leaders, distinguish between priorities, and actively implement all matters that should be promoted and reformed. Chen went on to point out that communication and transportation were the things that dissatisfied him the most during this tour. He said: From now on, even the central government agencies stationed in the province will be punished if they fail to fulfill their duties. Chen then elaborated on the current situation and the position of Taiwan Province, saying that the Communist Party has destroyed peace, is controlled by the Third International, and is attempting to betray the country, which has been seen by the world. From now on, we should follow the instructions of the President's recent announcement, and the revolution will surely achieve final success. He said that the current situation is dire and may become more serious in the next few months, but he firmly believes that it will gradually improve starting next year, and the year after that will be the time for the Kuomintang to be reborn, and Nanjing can be retaken. He continued: There is absolutely no need to worry about Taiwan Province's economy. From now on, he will eliminate all speculators on the island and strictly prohibit the Fifth Column from mixing into the province, so that Taiwan Province can be used as a base for the revival of the Chinese nation. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Currency Reform Delayed</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 30th] The authorities have decided to postpone the implementation of Taiwan currency reform because the time is not ripe. The reform plan has not been officially announced on the 30th, but it is generally expected that this measure will be seen within the month.</p>

Students who are willing to move west will be organized into student general brigades and set off on foot.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Strengthens Defenses</h3>
<p>Eden Calls for Defense of Hong Kong</p>
<p>[Reuters Hong Kong, 30th] It is learned that there are also many Hong Kong residents who are preparing to relocate, but according to travel agencies, there are not too many people who have inquired about transportation so far. Since the center of the Chinese civil war has shifted south, attention to defense issues has been stepped up here. A large number of people have volunteered or been transferred to join the Hong Kong Volunteer Defense Force this week to assist the police force and other civil defense forces. The Hong Kong regular defense force consists of approximately 6,500 people, including two battalions of Indian Gurkha infantry and an artillery brigade, all equipped with the latest equipment. The strength of the naval and air forces has also increased and can be further strengthened in a very short period of time. The strength of the police force has increased to more than 4,000 people in the past year.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 29th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden said at a Conservative Party meeting here on the night of the 29th: "The tragic events in China clearly remind us that the Communist offensive is global. Strategically, the door to the Communist advance in Europe has been closed, and Asia is actually the back door to Europe. Such events in Asia will of course have a great impact on the interests of the Allies in the region. We will continue to defend Hong Kong, there should be no doubt about that, and the lessons of the Yangtze River incident should not be forgotten."</p>
<h3>Chinese Communists Prohibit Gold and Silver Transactions; Not Allowed as Pricing Standard for Trade</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 29th] The Chinese Communist radio station in Peiping broadcast a revised regulation on the control of gold and silver in the "Liberated Areas" of North China on the night of the 29th, stating that "the purpose of taking this measure is to stabilize the currency value and the people's standard of living." According to the new regulations, gold and silver are absolutely prohibited from being transported out of the "Liberated Areas." People can hold gold and silver or sell it to the "People's Bank," but it is not allowed to use gold and silver as a pricing standard for trade or to conduct gold and silver transactions. Those who transfer gold and silver into the country from other "Liberated Areas" or foreign countries must have a government permit. All people entering or leaving the "Liberated Areas" cannot carry more than one tael of gold jewelry as a deposit or more than four *shi* taels of any silver jewelry. Silverware as a personal gift does not require a permit. People who want to sell gold and silver can only sell it to the People's Bank. When gold and silver are needed for industrial, commercial, or other legal purposes, they should apply to the People's Bank. Those who violate this regulation will have their gold and silver confiscated or forced to sell it to the People's Bank at a discounted price of 85% to 70%.</p>

<h3>British and American Governments Plan to Contact the Chinese Communists, But Not to Recognize the Chinese Communist Regime</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 29th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain continues to maintain diplomatic relations with the Chinese government because that government is still the government recognized by Britain, but its current location is not very clear. If that government reassembles in Guangzhou, the British embassy office headed by Kirk Hay, Counselor of the British Embassy in Nanjing, will be found there. The British government will continue to try to establish contact with the Chinese Communist authorities, but such contact cannot be called diplomatic relations. When asked what kind of relationship Britain intends to establish with the Chinese Communist authorities, he replied, we hope it is a "friendly relationship." The spokesman also said that the Nanjing Embassy led by Ambassador Stephen cannot find anyone to establish contact with. There is currently no Chinese Communist authority with centralized power in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 29th] A State Department spokesman announced on the 29th that the United States intends to establish a relationship with the Chinese Communist Party in order to conduct business, but this does not mean recognizing or approving of the Chinese Communist regime. According to State Department sources, the United Kingdom and the United States recently exchanged views on whether their consulates should remain in Chinese Communist territory, and both sides agreed that they should stay. The United States now has consulates in Nanjing, Peiping, Shenyang, and other Chinese Communist territories, and an embassy in Nanjing.</p>

<h3>Kuomintang Central Executive Committee Issues a Declaration Opposing the Chinese Communist Party's Reddening of China and Disrupting World Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th] The Central Reception Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a declaration on the 30th, opposing the Chinese Communist Party's reddening of China and disrupting world peace. The full text of the declaration is as follows:</p>
<p>On New Year's Day this year, President Chiang, in order to eliminate war and disband troops, issued a message to the Chinese Communist Party proposing an end to hostilities and the holding of peace talks, and stated his position that as long as the national system is not changed, the constitutional government is not overthrown, and the people's free life and the national army are guaranteed, his personal advancement and retreat will be based solely on the public opinion of the people. Subsequently, on January 21st, he resolutely declared his advance retirement, in accordance with the Constitution, with Vice President Li acting as President to promote the progress of peace talks.</p>
<p>After Vice President Li assumed the presidential authority, he devoted himself to finding a way to peace talks with extreme forbearance and suffering. Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan originally advocated a peace of "glory and equality," but when his proposal could not be realized, he did not hesitate to resign resolutely, hoping that peace talks could be opened. Later, General He Yingqin was appointed to form a new cabinet to assist Vice President Li in continuing to work for peace. Finally, under the urging of public opinion, on April 1st, both parties' representatives began peace talks in Peiping. Our party, in accordance with popular sentiment, made sacrifices to achieve peace in good faith, as was seen by the world.</p>
<p>Our party formally announced five principles for peace talks and resolutions on April 18th, believing that they were the guiding principles for the current state of affairs. We originally hoped that the Chinese Communist Party would accept them, negotiate in good faith, and establish lasting peace to comfort the people's eager expectations. Unexpectedly, the Chinese Communist Party has always been obsessed with ending the war by force, abandoning the conspiracy to seize power through violence. After our government representatives arrived in Peiping, they proposed their so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" in the form of an ultimatum. The eight articles and twenty-four clauses of its content were no different from cruelly and ruthlessly disposing of the Republic of China, which was built with great difficulty by the martyrs, fundamentally violating the spirit of the peace talks agreement. It has been formally rejected by Vice President Li and Premier He. At the same time, our party's Central Committee also issued a statement on the evening of April 20th, stating that our party would never accept such an agreement with nation-destroying conditions, and still hoped that the Chinese Communist Party would change its mind, both sides would order a ceasefire, and then engage in a long-term agreement. Our party's forbearance and sacrifice for the country and the people should also be understood by the world. However, after learning that our government had refused to sign this unreasonable agreement, the Chinese Communist Party blatantly disregarded everything and launched troops on April 21st to continue its invasion, forcibly crossing the Yangtze River in an attempt to sweep across the south of the Yangtze River and conquer the whole country. In order to redeploy its defense line and conduct a long-term resistance, the government had no choice but to withdraw from Nanjing and relocate the entire government to Guangzhou to continue fighting the Chinese Communist Party for the survival of the nation and to seek justice and achieve true and lasting peace.</p>
<p>What our party now wants to earnestly explain to people at home and abroad is that the birth and growth of the Chinese Communist Party is completely inseparable from its nature as the Fifth Column of the Red International. It is found that from the beginning of its establishment of party branches, it was subsidized by foreign money, and all its subsequent propaganda and actions were also subject to the orders of red international organizations. When our party reorganized in the 13th year of the Republic of China, in order to oppose imperialist aggression and carry out the National Revolution, it did adopt a policy of accommodating the Communists. Our party specially allowed Chinese Communist Party members to join our party as individuals. And it must abide by the joint statement of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Mr. Joffe, the representative of the Third International, and must not carry out a communist revolution in China, and must take an oath to obey the Three Principles of the People on the day of joining the party. However, unexpectedly, after joining our party, the members of the Chinese Communist Party constantly secretly carried out their insidious conspiracy to promote the communist revolution. Before long, it was detected by our party. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, after the Northern Expeditionary Army arrived in Wuhan, the Chinese Communist Party betrayed the National Revolution and launched peasant riots in an attempt to overthrow the political power of the National Government. This was the first exposure of the Chinese Communist Party as the Red Fifth Column. Our party broke with the Chinese Communist Party from then on. The National Revolution led by our party was therefore greatly frustrated.</p>
<p>Thereafter, our party continued the Northern Expedition and completed the unification, originally hoping to end the destruction from then on and carry out the construction of the Three Principles of the People. Unexpectedly, the Chinese Communist Party turned to organizing Soviet governments in Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangxi in the manner of bandits, carrying out its cruel land revolution. At that time, countless innocent people sacrificed their lives in this kind of struggle policy, numbering in the millions. Later, when the National Army encircled and suppressed them, they desperately scurried to Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan, and only managed to preserve their last remnants in northern Shaanxi. At this point, the Chinese Communist Party had nowhere to go and launched another conspiracy, using the slogan of resisting Japan as a smokescreen to instigate the Xi'an Incident. Finally, thanks to the maintenance of Chairman Chiang by the people of the whole country, they were able to return to the capital and take charge of the government. Then the War of Resistance was not interrupted. In July of the 26th year, when our government launched the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese Communist Party once again issued a statement, acknowledging that the Three Principles of the People were what China needed today, striving for its thorough realization, abolishing its Soviet regime, abandoning the land revolution, reorganizing the Red Army into the Eighth Route Army, accepting the command of Chairman Chiang, and working hard for the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Our party believed that the Chinese Communist Party could truly stimulate its patriotic conscience from then on, cooperate with our party again to resist the powerful enemy, which would be a great fortune for the country and the nation. However, in the three or four years after the War of Resistance, our party discovered that the Chinese Communist Party was using the War of Resistance as a cover to secretly expand its military strength and seize territory. Therefore, they were reluctant to engage the Japanese invaders and seized territory. They often attacked and contained the National Army. If it were not for the government's tolerance and consideration of the overall situation, the great cause of the War of Resistance would have been unthinkable. When the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Chinese Communist Party blatantly ignored the command of the Supreme Command and issued its own absurd order to accept the surrender, its ambition to betray the country again was obvious to everyone. At that time, in order to solve domestic problems by political means, so that the people could rest and engage in construction, the government convened the Political Consultative Conference. After a month of consultation, the results of the consensus of all parties were obtained. However, while friendly countries were carrying out mediation, the Chinese Communist Party still had the bad behavior of attacking the National Army everywhere and competing for territory. They also took advantage of the Soviet Red Army's occupation of the Northeast to delay the transfer of Lushun, Dalian, and the Northeast Railway, and dispatched cadres to sneak into Guanwai to recruit the puppet army and bandits, obtain the weapons of Japanese and Manchukuo prisoners, and develop their military strength in various parts of the Northeast. Zhang Xinfu, an engineer at the Fushun Coal Mine, was killed by the Communist Party at that time. The people of the country should still remember. The overall reddening of the Northeast today is the realization of the Chinese Communist Party's deliberate conspiracy. This is another complete exposure of the Chinese Communist Party as the Red Fifth Column. The results of the War of Resistance Against Japan led by our party have been destroyed again at this point. Based on our party's experience with the Chinese Communist Party over the past 20 years, we deeply know that the Chinese Communist Party is a group that has extinguished humanity, is insidious and vicious, and has no sincerity in its declarations and oaths, but only uses them as a means of fooling people and confusing society. Its doctrines change from yesterday to today, and its tactics are inconsistent. Its style is honey-mouthed and sword-hearted, sweet first and then bitter. The word "trust" does not exist in the Chinese Communist Party's dictionary. They have no compassion for human beings. In order to monopolize political power, they sacrifice the country and the nation, as well as countless precious lives, which they do not care about. Because they are obsessed with materialism and the historical view of struggle, they believe that human struggle is inevitable and that peace is illusory. Therefore, the party has never cooperated with any political party or individual outside the party on an equal footing, except for absolute control and domination. Even among its own members, there is no freedom of individual conscience and reason, except for absolute servitude to the party. A political party with such thoughts and beliefs is always a threat to human peace, world security, and individual life and freedom. When its power is not yet established, it may be possible to seek short-term temporary peace. Once its power becomes great, it will be difficult to have peaceful years. Its external form may change in countless ways, but its essence remains the same. The so-called New Democracy of Mao Zedong, and the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda to Westerners that it is only a peasant democratic party, are all temporary disguises to adapt to the environment. Therefore, since President Chiang's message on New Year's Day to reopen peace talks, for a period of four months, the Chinese Communist Party has never given up its ambition to seize political power by force, despite the urging of public opinion throughout the country. Even after the signing of the Atlantic Pact, Mao Zedong openly declared that when a world war occurs in the future, he will lead China to fight for the Soviet Union. His intention to be a henchman for a tiger and a tool for aggressive countries has been completely exposed. Who are the war criminals? How can they escape the eyes and ears of people at home and abroad?</p>
<p>Our party bears the responsibility of defending the Republic of China and world peace. Whenever we encounter any violence that endangers the country, the nation, and world peace and harms the people, we must lead the people of the whole country to eliminate it. Right and wrong are in people's hearts, and truth will never fail. This is our party's unwavering belief. Based on this belief, our party vows to abide by the Three Principles of the People, abide by the United Nations Charter, and strive to the end. People at home and abroad who love peace and cherish freedom should be able to recognize the significance of our party's continued war and provide spiritual and material support. Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>

<h3>Weekly Forum Theory and Action</h3>
<p>— Xie Youwei</p>
<p>What is theory? First, theory is a concept, an event in thought; second, theory can also be an event in written language. The progress of theory can be achieved from thought or concept to written or spoken language. But beyond the realm of written language, theory no longer becomes theory. Theory stops at the expression of written language. Written language is the limit of theoretical progress. Beyond this is the scope of action, not theory. Of course, if we are based on a doctrine of the unity of knowledge and action, this distinction does not exist. Because not only written language can be regarded as action, but thought can also be regarded as action in a certain sense. However, the distinction here is in the sense of common sense. In common sense, we cannot but admit that thought and written language are still within the scope of theory. Thus, a major characteristic of theory is peace. Theory is peaceful and without danger. The commonly called "dangerous theory" is definitely not the danger of the theory itself, nor the danger when the theory is still theory, but the danger when the theory becomes action. The danger lies in action, not in theory. As far as theory is concerned, theory is always peaceful. For example, someone proposes a theory to overthrow the government. If no one turns this theory into action, then the theory itself is not dangerous. Therefore, any presumptuous or false theory, on the condition that it does not become action, is not dangerous. Although theory may aim to modify the status quo or overthrow the status quo, it is not in itself a modification or overthrow of the status quo. The status quo is not affected by the theory itself. Theory is only the prelude to action, only the guide or plan for action. It only represents a possibility of action, but it is not the reality of action. It can become action, but it is not inevitable. Theory itself does not have the inevitability of becoming action. Without the inevitability of becoming action, all theories, no matter how false or presumptuous, are always peaceful, as long as they do not become action. We have nothing to fear from false theories. Theory itself will not harm people, let alone kill people. What harms people or kills people is action, actual action. Once it becomes action, all theories, even the most correct ones, are dangerous and not peaceful. This danger comes from action, and we must turn to discuss the so-called action.</p>
<p>What is action? First, action is a change in the physical appearance; second, action is also a change in the state of various environments outside the body. The development of action starts from the movement of the body itself, and then causes the action of the surrounding environment. As far as the origin of this movement is concerned, we have some control over it. Without discussing the issue of free will, we must always admit that all normal human beings have the power to control the activities of their hands and feet. When the state of coercion does not exist, normal human beings are able to freely move their hands and feet. However, after the movement of hands and feet, whether the environment moves, the degree of its movement, and the scope of its movement, are largely beyond the scope of human control. Human power can cause its own movement, but it cannot necessarily cause the movement of the environment. Even if it can cause the movement of the environment, this movement is not necessarily what the actor himself anticipated or needed. After the movement occurs, part of the consequences of the movement can be predicted, most of them cannot be predicted, part of them can be controlled, and most of them cannot be controlled. An atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima. What were the consequences of this action? The bomber or commander at the time may have foreseen the destruction of Hiroshima and the surrender of Japan, but could he have foreseen the current situation? Can he control the current situation? In any action, we cannot fully predict its consequences, nor can we fully control its consequences. Our predictions and our control have certain limits. Beyond certain limits, even natural scientists in laboratory experiments have unpredictable and uncontrollable components. The actions of atomic energy experimenters in the laboratory are a good example. Einstein is already regretting his invention! In this view, a major characteristic of action, which is exactly the opposite of theory, is insecurity. Action is insecure and extremely dangerous. The danger of action lies first in the excessive number of obstacles to action, and we cannot predict and control them all. Second, the impact of action is too broad, and it can extend to an infinite realm in both time and space, so we cannot predict and control it. Even if we consider ourselves to be extremely safe actions, sometimes they can have dangerous consequences. For example, I have one tael of gold. After I exchange it for gold yuan bills, I will use it to purchase materials. From my personal point of view, I really cannot see any danger in this action. However, if I do this, and the second person, the third person, and even the people of the whole of Shanghai and the whole of China do this, and they all turn the gold yuan bills exchanged for gold or foreign currency into materials, the danger will immediately occur. The recent economic crisis can be said to have been partly caused by such actions. Was this something I could have foreseen? Could I have controlled its impact? This fully demonstrates the danger of any action.</p>
<p>The above briefly explains a major characteristic of theory and action. Because theory is peaceful, we can be more casual, more laissez-faire, or more free with theory. At the stage of theory, all theories can be proposed, published, and circulated arbitrarily. Even if we think it is the most absurd or false theory, we may as well consider it. The more theories we consider, the more likely a correct theory is to be formed. Action is different. Because action is dangerous, we must be very cautious about action and cannot be too laissez-faire or too free. In particular, the government's actions on political and economic matters should be treated with great caution. Its danger is more dangerous than any action. Its mistakes are related to the lives and property of the people of the whole country. It does not allow for mistakes. As the ancients said, "One slip makes a thousand years of regret." The mistakes of action cannot necessarily be remedied by another action. Therefore, before the government takes any political and economic action, it must have a long period of consideration, a very thorough consideration, and it must first solicit various theories for reference for action. When doing so, even if the danger of action cannot be completely avoided, it can at least reduce the danger of action. When doing so, even if the government's actions still have mistakes, it is more likely to gain the understanding of the people of the whole country. This is a step that all actions should take, especially the steps that government actions should take. Without doing so, without going through such steps, this action is rash and excessively ignores the danger of action. Based on this, what we can criticize about the economic actions taken by the government this time is that the action was rash and excessively ignored the danger of action. The reason is that the government's action this time did not go through the review of the Legislative Yuan and did not widely adopt the theories of various parties, but issued it with an emergency decree. This is what we can criticize the government for.</p>
<p>However, although we can criticize the government for its rash actions or criticize its theoretical errors, we must pay attention to two very important points. The first point is the unavoidable danger of the action itself. This means that the government's action may be correct, but it has encountered unavoidable obstacles or dangers. This is the only thing we can forgive the government for. The second point is that our criticism of the government is not necessarily correct. Our criticisms and our suggestions are all theories before they become actions. Our theories, before being tested by action, also have the possibility of error. Now the government has actually adopted some of the critics' theories and put them into action. Can this modified or corrective action succeed or is there no danger at all? This will naturally have to be proven by future facts. What can be said here is that difficulties or dangers are difficult to completely avoid. We will immediately rise up again to criticize the government's actions. This can be asserted. Theorists always stand in a safe position, and actors always stand in a dangerous position. This is the main difference between theory and action. Although this does not absolve the government of responsibility for its actions, it can enable us to have a clearer or more just understanding of this economic change.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Proposes Conditions for Lifting Berlin Blockade Initial Progress in US-Soviet Talks Foreign Ministers' Meeting Likely to Be Held at the End of May</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 30th] A spokesman for the US Mission to the United Nations announced last night after US Representative Jessup and British Representative Malik consulted that the two representatives' consultations had made extremely satisfactory progress. The spokesman also said that the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union decided to report the consultations between Jessup and Malik to their respective governments. The spokesman did not reveal what the issues of the consultations were. Jessup left here on the 29th for Washington to submit a detailed report to Secretary of State Acheson. The spokesman stressed that the consultations were preliminary in nature in order for both sides to learn the correct content of the proposal and decide whether the proposal could be accepted.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 30th] The Soviet Union and Western countries made very slow progress today on the establishment of an agreement to lift the Berlin blockade. Representatives of Western countries believe that it is not possible to be too optimistic at this time, but they believe that the Soviet proposal is reasonable.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 29th] US Representative Jessup, at the invitation of Soviet Representative Malik today, held a fifth conversation at the Soviet delegation's office to discuss the liberation of the Berlin blockade, which lasted two and a half hours. The results have not yet been announced, but Jessup was seen smiling when he left. Jessup now intends to report to the State Department and then meet with the British and French representatives. Jessup said that it has not yet been determined whether to hold another conversation with the Soviet representative. According to informed sources, Malik has submitted a reply to the US inquiry as to when and under what conditions the Soviet Union is willing to lift the Berlin blockade. Malik also suggested that a meeting of the four foreign ministers should be held in Paris around May 25 to discuss the entire Berlin issue. In addition, it is learned that Malik suddenly proposed at the UN General Committee this morning that the current session of the General Assembly should end on May 18 so that representatives of major groups can have more than a week of leisure to attend the meeting on the 25th in Paris. The only obstacle to the meeting of the four foreign ministers is now how to draw up the agenda.</p>
<h3>British and American Policies Towards Germany Hope Germany Completes Unification Bevin Receives Report on US-Soviet Talks</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 29th] The "New York Times" today carried reliable news from Lake Success that if the meeting of the four foreign ministers is restored, the United Kingdom and the United States will suggest that the Soviet occupation zone in Germany be merged with West Germany to become a unified country. The effect of this proposal is to make the Soviet strategy unable to use its skills. However, France has not yet expressed its agreement. The United States also intends to suggest a major reduction in military forces, but does not agree with the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw all occupying forces. Spokesmen for the British and American delegations at Lake Success said that they knew nothing about the above news in the "New York Times" and that if there was such a proposal, it would have to be drafted in Washington or London.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Judging from reports from New York, London has great hope that the Berlin blockade can be lifted quickly, followed by a meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the German problem. Foreign Minister Bevin has received a report from British Chief Representative to the UN McNeil regarding his discussions with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko on the Berlin issue on Wednesday. Bevin has also received a report from British Representative to the Security Council Cadogan on the discussions between US and Soviet representatives Jessup and Malik on the Berlin issue. These reports show that the Soviet Union has adopted a tactful attitude on the issue of lifting the Berlin blockade. According to relevant sources, the exact date for the liberation of the blockade and the convening of the foreign ministers' meeting has not yet been determined, but the date for the convening of the foreign ministers' meeting will not be later than May. However, according to another authoritative source, it is not impossible for the efforts to liberate the Berlin blockade to be thwarted again. The United Kingdom is paying particular attention to whether the Soviet Union has any attempt to hinder the establishment of the West German government.</p>
<h3>West German Plan Determined to Proceed as Scheduled</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 29th] The British and American military governors have informed the premiers of the British and American zones of West Germany that, regardless of whether there is a new four-power meeting, West Germany will still be established as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Moscow Cautious About Berlin Problem Negotiations Soviet Newspapers Do Not Mention a Word</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 29th] The Soviet Union's attitude towards lifting the Berlin blockade and restoring the meeting of the four foreign ministers is very cautious today. The Moscow newspapers have not mentioned a word about this news for two days. US President Truman's remarks that the Soviet Union has sincerity are very welcome here. Opening the Berlin deadlock is enough to improve the relationship between the Soviet Union and Western countries. There is indeed hope and considerable belief here. According to an ambassador of a neutral country, "I still believe in the skills of politicians, and I still believe that international harmony can be promoted by the skills of politicians. Both sides have politicians, and in the current situation, nothing is impossible. This may be a turning point for the world's expectations."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 30th] The Moscow radio station broadcast the "Truth Daily" editorial on Labor Day today, accusing the British and American warmongers of having drafted a crazy plan to dominate the world, but it will never succeed. The friendship between the Soviet Union and the British and American people is the best guarantee of lasting peace. At the same time, according to Moscow, Soviet people are very reserved about the possibility of lifting the Berlin blockade.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Emphasizes British Commonwealth Conference; Believes Pacific Pact is Brewing</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] The Soviet Union's Red Star newspaper stated today that the London Conference of Dominion Prime Ministers is an important step in establishing a Pacific Pact under British leadership. The aim is to include Pacific or Indian Ocean countries within the system of the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands, and Japan may also participate in this system. People in the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions are now more actively participating in the peace movement and believe that the Atlantic Treaty and other systems attached to it will inevitably fail.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] Pakistani Prime Minister Ali Khan stated that the outcome of the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference will not affect Pakistan's position within the Commonwealth. However, Pakistan insists on reserving the right to withdraw from the Commonwealth at any time.</p>
<h3>Clay to Resign; Farewell Address to the German People</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 29th] General Clay, the US Commander of the Occupying Forces in Germany, delivered a farewell address today to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers in the Anglo-American zone, stating that even if the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade, the airlift will continue. Clay also said that the Allies will never allow the dangerous situation in Berlin to recur in the future. All existing institutions in West Germany will continue to exist until a federal government is established to replace them. Clay said that the German people work very hard and are very talented in technical research, and he also praised the German people's good discipline. Kaiser, the President of the Bremen Senate, spoke on behalf of his colleagues in the Anglo-American zone, expressing his gratitude for Clay's achievements in Germany. Clay is expected to resign soon.</p>
<h3>Handling Former Italian Colonies; UK and US Propose New Proposals; Soviet Union Advocates Early Conclusion of the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] According to well-informed sources, the United Kingdom and the United States will submit a resolution to the UN Political Committee authorizing the UN General Assembly to grant Libya independence in ten years.

<h3>Churchill Issues Campaign War Signal</h3>
<p>Revealing the Conservative Party's Four-Point Plan</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] British Conservative Party leader Winston Churchill issued a campaign war signal to his six thousand followers at the Cherry Blossom Alliance's conference at Albert Hall in London today. He said, "We have now entered a decisive year, which will produce the most noteworthy election battle. The Conservative Party's future is very promising, but every Conservative Party member still needs to exert their greatest effort." Churchill pointed out that the people are uneasy about the Labour Party's nationalization plan, so the Labour Party feels that it has no chance of winning. The recent suggestion by Labour Deputy Prime Minister Morrison that voters who elect workers from parties other than the Labour Party will have a signal shows that the Labour Party leaders have no confidence. This indicates that the Labour Party is gradually approaching failure and that the Labour Party disregards the foundations of political freedom. The Conservative Party Deputy Leader put forward the Conservative Party's four-point plan: (1) Reduce government spending to reduce taxes; (2) Stop the nationalization plan; (3) Launch a production stimulation plan; (4) Restore the Victorian era's spirit of thrift, which is the foundation of British national wealth.</p>

<h3>Salary Index Announced for the First Time; 371,344 Times the Base; Authorities Decide on Two Measures for Wage Payment</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Employee Living Index Compilation and Review Committee held a routine meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:00 AM yesterday. Those present included Municipal Government Statistics Director Chu Yifei, Social Affairs Bureau Director Cao Peizi, Labor Affairs Department Director Shen Ding, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yan E'sheng, General Labor Union Fang Rusheng, Ye Xianggao, Sun Wenyuan, Qiu Changjiang, Industrial Association Tian Heqing, Liu Qingyi, Ouyang Lun, Jin Runxiang, etc. Chairman Chu Yifei first reported on the current employee living cost index. Based on the suggestion of the labor-management evaluation committee and approved by the municipal government meeting, the average of the three highest material prices of the current period was adopted as the salary index. It was then decided to fix three types of indexes: base period index, chain index, and salary index, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The fixed base index takes 48.04 times the upper half of January of the 38th year (1949) as the base period. The total index and classification indexes are as follows:</p>
<p>Total index: 4909.37 (235,846 times the base price of August 19)</p>
<p>Classification indexes:</p>
<p>Food Category: 5266.61</p>
<p>Clothing Category: 4211.70</p>
<p>Water, Electricity, Fuel, and Housing Category: 5091.58</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Category: 3034.50</p>
<p>(2) Chain index (i.e., the comparison of the current period to the previous period)</p>
<p>Total index: 15.58</p>
<p>Classification indexes:</p>
<p>Food Category: 15.04</p>
<p>Clothing Category: 16.94</p>
<p>Water, Electricity, Fuel, and Housing Category: 18.01</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Category: 12.40</p>
<p>(3) Salary index (i.e., based on the average price of the three days with the highest prices in the current period). The total index and classification indexes are as follows:</p>
<p>Total index: 7729.90 (371,344 times the base price of August 19)</p>
<p>Classification indexes:</p>
<p>Food Category: 8254.54</p>
<p>Clothing Category: 7040.83</p>
<p>Water, Electricity, Fuel, and Housing Category: 7978.22</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Category: 4746.30</p>
<p>The above figures were carefully reviewed by the committee members and signed after passing.</p>
<p>In addition, the municipal authorities, in view of the extreme confusion of various prices in recent days, had a temporary emergency measure of temporarily not publishing the current employee living cost index. However, due to the different basic salaries of various manufacturers and employees, the settlement was quite difficult. After careful discussion by the municipal government in conjunction with relevant agencies, it was decided that the lower-term employee living cost index for April would still be published as usual according to the results of the index compilation and review meeting held at 10:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>The National Bank Should Exchange and Issue 400,000 Silver Dollars</p>

It should be exchanged for silver dollars, with each silver dollar priced at 4 million yuan in gold yuan coupons, and 100,000 silver dollars should be allocated daily. The exchange procedure is that the factory's corresponding bank drafts a check from the National Bank, which is endorsed by the factory and the Industrial Association and must be completed from April 30th to May 4th (one day is Sunday). (2) Each factory union's wages can be exchanged for one silver dollar in advance according to the standard of each silver dollar price in the first article. The remaining wages shall be supplemented by the factory with physical goods or banknotes within four days after April 30.</p>

<h3>Mayor's Cup Men's and Women's Finals: Green Team vs. Eagle Team, China United vs. Hui Li; Additional Friendly Match Between Da Gong and Shanghai Police</h3>
<p>In the Mayor's Cup basketball tournament, in addition to one game each of the men's and women's round-robin finals tonight, the organizers have added a friendly match between Da Gong and Shanghai Police between the two finals, for a total of three games. The games will start at 4:30 PM (daylight saving time). Tickets are 200,000 for the upper level, 400,000 for the lower level, and 800,000 for reserved seating inside the court. Reserved seating tickets will be pre-sold at the Municipal Gymnasium from 10:00 AM, and the remaining tickets will be sold from 1:00 PM. The stadium gates will open at 3:00 PM, and the Scout Association of China will maintain order in the stadium. The program for today is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Green Team vs. Eagle Team (Women's Final) 4:30 PM</p>
<p>Da Gong vs. Shanghai Police (Friendly) 5:15 PM</p>
<p>China United vs. Hui Li (Men's Final) 6:15 PM</p>
<p>In the first game, the women's final between Green Team and Eagle Team, the former is the women's basketball champion and has recently won the league championship for the fourth consecutive time. Their strength and momentum are immense, and they intend to win the Mayor's Cup. They will not relax at all in tonight's game. Although the Eagle Team is a new team, under the leadership of Wang Shan, their basketball skills are quite impressive. Their player Yang Shujun is unusually brave. Facing a formidable opponent, they will do their best, and a wonderful performance is expected.</p>
<p>The second game is the match between Da Gong and Shanghai Police. Both teams are strong basketball teams in Shanghai. Da Gong did not participate in this year's league and was unfortunately defeated by Hui Li in the Mayor's Cup knockout stage, so they did not have the opportunity to compete with Shanghai Police. Holding a friendly match will satisfy the curiosity of the fans, and a wonderful performance is expected.</p>
<p>The final game is the men's final between China United and Hui Li. The former is the old men's basketball champion, with extraordinary style. In the first game of the finals, although they encountered stubborn resistance from Ren Yu and were seriously threatened, they were able to remain calm and reverse the situation in the final moments, ultimately achieving victory. Hui Li's basketball skills are improving steadily. Overwhelming Da Gong and advancing to the final four is commendable. In addition to the three musketeers of Tian, Wang, and Zhao, Shang's brothers and Yu Dinghou are all as lively as dragons and tigers. Although they lost to Shanghai Police in the finals, they will fight bravely against the formidable opponent, and success is not impossible.</p>
<p>Eight Games in the Division B Table Tennis League Today</p>
<p>Due to work commitments, the Shanghai Police team in Division B2 of the table tennis league is unable to continue the competition and has sent a letter to the authorities stating their withdrawal.

B1 Hongbai can beat Shuping, but will definitely lose to Lingyun. B1 Xingguang, the champion of last year's Division C, has strong strength, and Guansheng Jingwei will hardly be able to resist and may be defeated. Tiema has excellent spirit in four games, but is still no match for Tianxiang. Yi Zhong has many small ball players, but may be frustrated by Yucai at the table tennis table. Jinmen 3 will face a strong team and learn from You 3.</p>

At the 20th minute, Qunli's Lin Shaojun got the ball and passed it back to Xi Boming. A mistake allowed Jiang Kun to take the opportunity to score into the empty goal, opening the scoring. Then the two teams had a fiery performance. Zheng Bingyi played rough, and Zhou Bingrong was also warned. At the 34th minute, Xu Humin scored, giving Longtou a 2-0 lead. At the 42nd minute, Jiang Kun and Ruan Lang scored again, ending the first half with a score of 3-0.</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight again, the battle was still tense, and the actions of both sides did not improve. Qunli's Zhao Zhenhui was warned again. After ten minutes, Xia Shufu attacked and assisted Wang Burong. Wang Burong shot, but Xi Boming pushed it out not far away. Jiang Kun waited and kicked the ball into the net, making it 4-0. At the 27th minute, Longtou had another chance. The forward advanced, and Chen Qin crossed from the right. Jiang Kun dribbled the ball quickly and scored, making it 5-0. Qunli surrendered. After another ten minutes, Longtou's defender fouled and was awarded a penalty. Qunli's Chen Longquan took the penalty, but the ball bounced back from Yan Chengkuan's body, missing a good opportunity. Although they tried to recover, they were unable to do so due to their depleted strength. As a result, Qunli lost by five goals, losing to Longtou again.</p>

<h3>Frequent Good News Excites People; Gold Rises All the Way; Silver Dollars Are in Short Supply and Demanded</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday's gold market was even more frenzied, with frequent good news exciting the people. With money still loose and no other outlet for funds, everyone scrambled to buy, and under the influence of the buying spree, raw silk opened at 190 million and 210 million in the over-the-counter market, rising all the way to 350 million and 370 million, breaking through the 300 million mark.</p>
<p>In the over-the-counter market for US dollars, various gangs were buying and selling dollars, and arbitrage was lively. The opening price was 4 million and 4.5 million, rising all the way to 7.5 million, about twice as high as the previous day. On the streets, "big heads" (silver dollars) were exchanged for US dollars, trading at 7 to 7.5 yuan.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Yesterday's street silver dollars, due to the Central Bank's large banknotes flowing out, increased the number of cash chips. Those holding Chinese currency only bought and did not sell, resulting in a shortage of supply. The "big heads" broke through the four million mark from 2.6 million and 2.8 million, and rose to 4 million and 4.5 million near noon.</p>
<p>After the banking hours, the rising momentum slowed down, because a large amount flowed in from Ningbo. In the evening, amidst a chorus of sell orders, it could reach 3 million and 3.5 million. "Small heads" were 2.8 million and 3 million. Draft transactions were divided into three types: Central Bank fixed-amount drafts, with "big heads" finally trading at 5 million and 6 million; bank drafts before number 50 traded at 8 million and 9 million; and large-amount drafts from small banks traded at 9 million and 10 million, an increase of 50% from the previous day.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: At the Dengjiao Building, the gold and silver exchange ratio saw frequent inflows and outflows, and trading was brisk. "Big heads" initially traded at 33 and 36, rising to 36 and 39, and finally falling to 35 and 38.</p>
<h3>Gold Bonds Hit Upper Limit</h3>
<p>Due to the rapid rise in gold, people are extremely excited, and there are prices but no goods in the market, so there is no transaction. The opening price was shouted at 10,944,000 yuan, hitting the upper limit. There were no sales until noon, and there was no market after banking hours on Saturday.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Nearly Double</h3>
<p>Still About the Same as the Previous Day When Converted to Silver Dollars</p>
<p>The trading time for rice has been very short recently. Trading opens at 9:30 AM and ends at 10:30 AM. Yesterday, rice prices rose sharply again due to the rise in gold, banknotes, and silver dollars. The Nanshi Market had white japonica rice at 15 million yuan, thin indica rice at 15.6 million yuan, and early rice at 14.1 million yuan, all rising nearly twofold. However, when converted to silver dollars, they were still about the same as the previous day, with white japonica rice at 5 yuan, thin indica rice at 5.2 yuan, and white japonica rice and thin indica rice at 12.1 million yuan in the Beishi Market, all being cash prices. The registered arrival of goods in the two markets was 347 shi.</p>
<p>Cooking oil followed the rapid rise in gold, banknotes, and silver dollars by more than twofold, but the rise was not as fast as that of silver dollars, so the price converted to silver dollars actually decreased. Soybean oil closed at 11.9 million to 11.2 million, raw vegetable oil at 98 million, and lucky barrel raw oil at 11.2 million, all being draft prices, rising more than twofold. When converted to silver dollars, soybean oil was 16 yuan, raw vegetable oil was 13 yuan, and raw oil was 16 yuan, each decreasing by 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour jumped again by 50%. Because the rise in gold and banknotes was too fast, it was even more out of touch with the market price. Lao Che initially quoted 1.4 silver dollars, but closed at 4.2 million, only equivalent to 1.2 silver dollars. Bingship opened in the morning at 3.4 million, and closed at 3.6 million, equivalent to 1.03 silver dollars. Bran remained firm, with a large package of Fuxin at 3.5 million, equivalent to 1 silver dollar.</p>
<p>The rise in miscellaneous grains was in full swing, and the gold yuan was devaluing more and more. The market quoted prices were shockingly chaotic. Soybeans increased sharply by more than double, and more beans were priced at 10 million. Raw kernels increased violently by one time. Sesame trading was still strong, and corn was clearly firm but secretly weak. When converted to gold yuan, the rise was still strong. Vegetables were quoted at 3.8 yuan, and red sorghum and meta wheat were still not trading.</p>
<h3>Pricing Standards Are Confusing; Cotton Cloth Market Stalled Yesterday</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market was stalled again in the field. Pricing in silver dollars was not allowed by law, and the gold yuan was devaluing rapidly. Coupled with the weekend closure, it was difficult to predict the situation next week, so trading was unable to proceed in the field. As for over-the-counter transactions, most were still settled in silver dollars. From 3.5 silver yuan Shanghai to 3.8 silver yuan, private factory prices were adjusted again, all rising by about one time. High-end Shilin cloth opened at 44 million, khaki at 50 million, broadcloth at 25 million, and retail cloth prices were chaotic. Red Longtou fine cloth 15 chi sold for 5 million.</p>
<p>Another report: Fangjian customarily opened for sale of cotton cloth, including Yanghe fine cloth, grade two metaphite serge, Da ling extra fine twill jumping carp bleached cloth, and color ball yuan twill, totaling fourteen kinds.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn over-the-counter market still quoted prices in gold. 42 count Lanfeng last called 3 liang 6 qian, and Jincheng called 3 liang 3 qian. 40 count Lanfeng called 3 liang 2 qian, and Jincheng 3 liang 1 qian. 31 count Yinyue Lanfeng called 2 liang 6 qian. 21 count Shuangma shuttle single called 2 liang, and spot goods called 2 liang 15. 20 count Jincheng large package called 2 liang, Tiannv 2 liang 15, Jincheng small package 1 liang 85, miscellaneous brand 1 liang 78, 16 count Guangming 1 liang 5, and 10 count Zhangzijiang 1 liang 3 qian.</p>
<h3>Various Versions of Silver Dollars Must Be Absolutely Uniform; Assemblies and Demonstrations Are Prohibited on May 1st; Decided at Yesterday's Garrison Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] According to reports: 1. Yesterday's garrison conference decided: (1) The circulating prices of various versions of silver dollars, including "ship version", "big head", "small head", "dragon foreign", "eagle foreign", and "Sichuan version", must be absolutely uniform, and it is not allowed to differentiate versions or set prices differently in any way. Violators will be detained for disrupting financial order. (2) Assemblies and demonstrations are absolutely prohibited on "May 1st" Labor Day. Violators will be dealt with according to martial law. 2. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters will hold a routine press execution meeting today at 3:00 PM, with the location still being the guest house.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Performed Outstandingly; Over-the-Counter Transfers Were Also Rare</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Chinese stock market, under the accelerating frenzy of gold, silver, and commodity prices, people have become frenzied. Both popular and unpopular stocks are in demand and in short supply. Trading in the field is equal to formality, and over-the-counter transfers are all exchanged for silver dollars.</p>
<p>After Yongsha saw 514 yuan, the upper limit, opening in the field, other stocks also opened at the upper limit. From morning to noon, there was no transaction. Yongsha over-the-counter transfer was 28 silver yuan and 30 silver yuan, exchanging 100,000 shares. Other small and medium-sized popular stocks were also priced in silver dollars, with different prices and a chaotic market.</p>
<h3>Three Newspapers Suspended Publication; One Changed to Evening Paper</h3>

In addition, the Zhonghua Shibao has decided to stop publishing the daily newspaper today and will change to publishing an evening edition from tomorrow.</p>
