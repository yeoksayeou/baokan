<h3>蔣總裁告全國同胞　接受教訓努力全面革新　一致奮起爭取最後成功</h3>
<p>〔中央社溪口廿七日電〕蔣總裁頃發表告全國同胞書，原文如次：</p>
<p>全國同胞！現在共黨匪軍強渡長江，南京業已撤守，我愛國軍民同胞八年血戰，從日本軍閥鐵蹄之下光復的首都，為時未及四年，又淪陷在共產國際鐵幕之中。我們今日面對着這一摧殘人民自由，毀滅國家獨立，威脅世界和平的黑暗的暴力，每一個國民的生死，已經是與整個國家的存亡結成一體，而不可分了。中正雖引退在野，為國民一份子，而對於國家的危難，同胞的災禍，仍自覺其負有重大的責任，際此憂危震撼之時，中正重申決心，誓與我全國同胞共患難，同生死，並掬我赤忱，向我愛國軍民特進一言。</p>
<p>在對日作戰時期，我們中國唯一重大的問題，就是堅持抗戰，爭取勝利，到了抗戰勝利以後，共產黨問題就是我們中國唯一重大的問題了，所以中正在抗日戰事甫告停止之時，卽竭盡心力，尋求政治解決的方法，我們知道共產黨問題是一個國際問題，不是我們中國所能單獨解決，但在當時，我們認定這一問題如果由中國本身或國際共同以和平方法來解決，則抗戰的成果可以保持，人民可以休養生息，國家建設可以順利進行，而世界和平安全也不致受其威脅，所以我們政府當時以最大的誠意，不惜忍讓一切，召開政治協商會議，接受美國的軍事調處，並四度頒發停戰命令，以促進和平解決的成功，不料談商調處經過了一年有餘的時間，共產黨不獨毫無謀和的誠意，幷且變本加厲，倒行逆施，利用和平商談與軍事調處的掩護，和國軍停戰的機會，進據東北，阻撓國軍接收東北的主權，幷南渡黃河，擴大中原的戰亂。政府至此，始不能不採取軍事行動，積極剿匪，在戡亂政策確立之時，我們知道如果剿匪軍事不能在一二年以內達到成功的境城，不但人民痛苦如水益深，幷且亞洲安全與世界和平，將受嚴重的影響，我們中國將成為第三次世界大戰的戰塲，與世界人類同罹空前未有的浩刦。因此，政府集中力量，動員作戰，務期戡亂政策得以貫澈，軍事行動迅速完成，以拯救國家的危亡，消弭人類的戰禍。但是由於我們政治軍事的缺陷，中外人士的誤解，再加以共產黨宣傳的毒素與間諜活動滲透於其間，使我們內政，外交與士氣人心，都不能適應剿匪動員的需要，遂演成今日的嚴重局勢。</p>
<h3>嚴重局勢的演成　民主國不能卸責</h3>
<p>今年元旦，中正重申和平解決中共問題的方針，幷潔身引退，以期促成和平的實現，三個月來李代總統忍辱負重，與共黨折衝，委屈求全，無微不至，但是在此期間，共黨公然發表了在第三次世界大戰中幫助蘇俄作戰的宣言，暴露其國際第五縱隊的面目，接着便提出了他所謂「國內和平協定」八條廿四款的招降書，迫使我國軍繳械降匪，撤除我國家獨立人民自由的保障，最後更發出其總攻擊令，突破我長江防綫，向江南大舉進犯。共黨這次以強暴專橫的態度破壞和平商談繼續擴大變亂，更是完全證明了他的目的不是和平，而是戰爭，更確切的說，他的目的不是為了中國的和平與民生，而是對於中國的侵略和征服。要把我一千二百萬方公里的領土，造成第三次世界大戰之中共產國際的基地，要把我四億五千萬同胞充當第三次世界大戰的砲灰，要把我中華民族五千年崇高優秀的歷史文化摧毀無遺，要把我們中國以仁愛和平為本位的倫理，轉變為冷酷殘忍的鬥爭，參加國際的殘殺。這一嚴重局勢的演成，始終是在我們苦思焦慮之中，這不止是中國一國存亡的決定關頭，而世界民主國家對此都不能迴避其影響，也就不能諉卸其應負的責任。</p>
<p>願以在野之身　追隨軍民奮鬥</p>
<p>同胞們！我們看透了共黨匪徒滅亡祖國，出賣民族的陰謀。我們領受了和平商談兩度失敗的教訓。我們對於匪軍橫暴殘忍的進逼，只有全國一致，萬眾一心，奮起應戰，我們當前的情勢固然是險惡的，我們今後的戰關亦是艱苦的，但是我們認淸了今日剿匪作戰是反侵略主義的民族戰爭，是反極權主義的民主戰爭，同時也是為了每一個國民，每一個家庭自由生活方式的社會戰爭，和保障我悠久的歷史，優秀的文化，和平仁愛的倫理道德的文化戰爭，這一戰爭最後的結果，將要決定整個國家的存亡，將要決定每一個國民和家庭的生死與禍福。這一個反侵略戰爭如果失敗，國家的獨立自由地位，人民的自由生活方式，都必歸於毀滅，我們的前途只有普遍的貧窮，冷酷的飢餓和世界戰爭。若是這一個反侵略反共產戰爭果能成功，則國家是獨立的國家，人民是自由的人民，對於世界的和平與安全，有其光榮的貢獻。當此國家民族存亡生死之交，中正願以在野之身，追隨我愛國軍民同胞以後，擁護李代總統暨何院長領導作戰，奮　到底。現在這個戰　是開始了！我們今日只有在一個政府之下，以對共的態度為忠奸的試金石，凡是反共的政策，就要力謀貫澈，凡是剿共的命令，便要絕對服從。我們今日只有在民族大義之下不分職業階級，不計個人恩怨，凡是不願做共產國際的奴隸牛馬，不能坐視民族歷史文化的淪亡，不能坐視祖宗　墓田園的喪失，家庭夫婦兒女的分離，一切反共產反侵略，反極權主義的人們站在一起，精誠團結，集中力量，集中意志，百折不回，奮鬥到底，我深信必能克服當前的危機，達到最後的勝利。</p>
<p>祛除依賴觀念　洗滌僥倖心理</p>
<p>同胞們，我們中國原是一個貧弱的國家，但在東亞大陸實是一個獨立的大國，而且為國家獨立，民族自由，為了民主和平而奮鬥，持有光榮無比的歷史。我們今日剿共，是為獨立自由和每一人民自身生存而戰，也是為世界安全人類幸福而戰，我們今日不顧共產國際的誣蔑，不問民主國家的觀感，站在反侵略的尖端，作世界反共鬥爭的先鋒，我們相信世界總有公理，人類必持正義，只要我們盡其在我，在國際社會上一定是吾道不孤，但是我們必須祛除依賴的觀念，尤其要洗滌僥倖的心理，中共在四月四日已經發出宣言，信誓旦旦，在第三次大戰中幫助蘇俄作戰了，他決沒有一點國家意識和民族思想，他對於祖國和同胞也就沒有絲毫的愛護和責任感。我們經過和平商談的兩度失敗，絕對不能想像共產匪徒還會改變他的政策，更不能希冀他還有和平妥協的可能。要知道毛澤東甘心依附共產國際，做侵略國家擴張政策的工具，其為漢奸與汪精衛相同，而其背景之深沉，行為之陰毒，遠非汪精衛所能比擬於萬一。汪精衛是在我們抗日戰爭受了挫折的時期，對抗戰喪失信心，投降日本軍閥，為他個人謀苟且偷生之地。而今日的毛澤東乃是在我們抗戰已告勝利之後，國家獨立自主的地位已經確立，建設事業正在萌芽滋長，人民生活正要走向復員進步的前途，不料他喪心病狂，竟帶領了他共黨匪徒處心積慮，摧毀抗戰勝利的戰果，破壞國家獨立自主的地位，阻撓國家的建設，妨害人民的復員和休養生息，甘心把中國的領土主權作為他賣身投靠，賣國求榮的犧牲品。他每一步驟，每一行動，都是執行國際陰謀，施逞狂妄野心，這豈是汪精衛所能望其項背？我們今日面對此五千年歷史空前未有的元凶巨憝，只有恢復我們革命精神，發揮各人自己的力量，把握匪軍的弱點，再接再厲，奮鬥到底，不然，我們如果稍存依賴，只有因循怠惰，任人宰割，如果中途妥協，只有投降，更只有駢首就戮，自取滅亡。</p>
<p>救國救民信念不移　軍政民打成一片　轉危為安之機就在今日</p>
<p>我們承認過去東北和華北屢次的失敗，我們預料當前局勢也許還要惡化，但是我們決不氣餒，更絕不失望，要知道我們過去的失敗，並不是匪軍實力怎樣的堅強，而是我們政治的缺點，經濟的恐慌，內部組織的鬆懈，使共黨匪徒有隙可乘，所以他能肆無忌憚的，在我們前方軍隊與後方民眾中間埋伏間諜，散播失敗主義的毒素，以瓦解士氣和人心，所以國軍擁有優勢的兵力，反招致嚴重的挫折。中正對於過去政治經濟的缺陷和剿匪軍事的失敗，以致我們同胞遭受共匪的蹂躪和殘殺，墮入共產主義的鐵幕，來過這種黑暗地獄的生活，這是我個人德薄能鮮，應該負其重大的責任，因為我對共產黨的陰謀暴行，認識特為深切，所以我對國家所處的危難與人民所受的災禍，愧疚尤其沉痛，但是我決不動搖我救國救民的信念，確信我們必能從共產鐵幕之中，拯救我全國同胞，重登自由康樂的境域。古人說：「失之東隅，收之桑榆」，今日只要我全國同胞一致奮起，擁護政府，督促政府，使政治有適時的改革，經濟有一定的方針，軍政幹部更能澈底覺悟，加強組織，只要我們接受失敗的教訓，使失敗成為陶冶和洗鍊，在政治上奏洗心革面之效，在軍事上收汰弱留強之功，更使軍事政治優秀的人才與民眾自衛活動打成一片，為剿匪武力開闢廣大無比的源泉，深信我們國家轉危為安之機，就在共匪渡江深入的今日。</p>
<p>同胞們，我們更要知道，渡江是匪軍發展的最高峯，同時就是匪黨暴露他最大的弱點，換言之，也就是他失敗的開始，固然，匪軍渡江以後，我們華南民眾又要遭遇華北和東北同胞一樣的黑暗和苦痛，但是我們國家和人民前途的光明與最後的勝利，亦就在此，因為就戰略和政略上來說，共匪已蹈日本軍閥南侵陷入泥淖的復轍，日本之所以急於南侵，是要在第二次世界大戰以前完成其控制全中國的夢想，而今日第三國際第五縱隊之共匪，亦妄想在第三次世界大戰以前，控制全中國，為共產國際充實其應付世界大戰之人力物力與資源，犯了日本軍閥一樣的錯誤，他這個大錯的鑄成，就是他自取滅亡的基因，亦就是我們中國剿共最後勝利的把握。我在抗戰勝利以後，對上海羣眾大會說：「我們還要再作八年苦鬥，用過去八年抗戰一樣的精神，來準備犧牲與忍受苦痛，方能獲得真正的勝利和成功」，這句話我就是為今日而說的，同胞們不要喪氣，不要悲觀，只要起來決心奮鬥，共匪就無法滅亡我們國家，亦不能奴役我們本身，不出三年，最後勝利必然是我們的。</p>
<p>接受代總統領導　服從何部長指揮</p>
<p>同胞們，國家的危亡與個人的災禍是十分迫切了，共匪必敗與反共必勝的道理，亦是十分明白了，而救國自救的戰鬥已經開始發動了，十一年前南京撤守，政府西遷，乃是我們政府長期抗日戰事的起點，今日南京撤守，政府南移，更成為我們中國反共鬥爭惟一的轉機，所望我全國軍民一致接受李代總統的領導，全體將士絕對服從何兼部長的指揮，掃除失敗主義的心理，發揮一切可用的力量，支持反侵略，反共產，求生存，求自由，拯救國家，保障民主的神聖莊嚴的戰爭，達到最後成功的境域，中正個人，領導國軍服務政府二十餘年，去過缺誤為國人所共見，亦為寸心所內疚，但我效忠國家葆愛人民的一片耿耿赤忱，自信可質諸天日而無愧，當此國家存亡，民族生死，歷史文化絕續的關頭，無論何時何地，必將始終不貳，追隨我全國愛國軍民同胞之後，竭忠盡智，剿滅共產國際的第五縱隊——共匪，策進中華民族的復興，恢復中華民國的獨立·民主和自由，實現三民主義完成國民革命，最後成功歸於最後努力者，願我全國同胞共勉之。</p>

<h3>艾德禮在下院報告　對共軍砲擊英艦事　英取保留態度　邱吉爾等紛紛提質詢</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕艾德禮首相告擁擠而緊張的下議院稱，由於中國局勢之尚動盪不定，故英國對於中共軍砲擊長江中英艦四艘造成重大死傷之事件保留其立塲。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿六日電〕艾德禮首相廿六日在下院聲明英國將採取各種可能步驟，保護中國境內英國僑民。惟英國對於中國局勢仍當遵守美英蘇一九四五年莫斯科協定，採取不干涉政策。保守黨領袖邱吉爾及其他議員多人為英艦四艘在長江被共軍砲轟事，紛紛提出質詢，攻擊工黨政府。工黨議員則相率高呼「保守黨要戰爭」以聲浪淹沒各種質詢。</p>

<p>艾德禮解釋稱，英艦「紫水晶」號開入戰區，手續「正確」。其他各艦則係開往解救「紫水晶」號，並無其他任務，更無討伐之問題，英艦開砲僅欲擊滅向其轟擊之軍隊。</p>

<h3>專論　發行銀元券問題</h3>
<p>— 何師琦</p>
<p>金圓券的膨脹限度愈大，物價的漲風也愈烈，這是必然的現象，尤其這兩天的物價，是日長夜大，金圓券時時在貶值，顯已失去了貨幣的性能。但是我們沉思一下，金圓券落到這樣悲慘的命運，究竟是誰之過？本來拿發行來做搖錢樹，作為財政的平衡費，是一種不智之圖，要知紙幣的信用，完全是基於一般的信仰上，若不控制信用，漫無限制地虛創購買力，當然難怪人民要不再把它作為貯藏的價值，和交換的尺度了。</p>
<p>現在金圓券在法律觀點上，雖仍舊是唯一法償的通貨，但拿社會上一般實際的情形來看，則金圓券無疑的已淪為銀元的一種輔幣了，這種現象，早已瀰漫在民間，固不待論，就拿官方而論，如軍隊發餉已改用銀元，雲南·陝西·廣東·福州·蘭州等省市的收支，都已公開的採用銀元作為單位，湖南公路客車的票價，也以銀元為基價，中央銀行付款給行莊，更搭發一部的銀元，大勢所趨，銀元確已成了取金圓券地位而代之的局面。不過在政府沒有正式承認它的地位以前，仍是一個矛盾的現象，其中潛伏的困難也很多，譬如士兵拿到了銀元的薪餉後，要求存款或匯款時，銀行就難以應付，又如商品用金圓券標價，亦有許多不便，事實如此，無庸諱辨，故政府理應從速追認銀元的合法地位，藉使銀行能展開銀元存放等物，各地物價，能直接用銀元為單位，而免去一般經濟生活繼續被不穩定通貨所困擾。</p>
<p>最近為了銀元本位與金圓券本位的抉擇問題，各方爭論頗盛，問題的焦點，已不再是銀本位制的是否落伍，而是地方與中央的發行權，以及金圓券的地位問題，這種事實，很為顯明，如過去長沙·漢口等地地方當局的醞釀發行銀元券，雲南富滇新銀行發行的半開銀元輔幣券，以及甘肅鑄錢局鑄造流通的銀元等；雖然長·漢兩地的動議，尚未成為事實，但滇·甘兩省的措施，畢竟政府也不得不作為事實上的默許。</p>
<p>關於各地發行地方幣的建議，正是不絕如縷，不但廣西參議會已在竭力促成地方當局發行銀元券，同時重慶參議會更主張川·康·滇·黔·渝五省市聯合發行西南區的銀元券，直接在區內行使，卽由該區各省市政府及各公私銀行斥資成立聯合準備庫，備足基金，以作兌現的準備，如此五省市的經濟，可不受大局動盪的牽制；此外本市參議長潘公展及市商會代表嚴諤聲兩氏，最近在市府招待會席上建議由商業行莊存足準備金，發行地方券，聞卽席已獲得陳代市長的支持。凡此種種，都是形成區域經濟壁壘的先聲，政府處在這種局面下，雖有心維持金圓券的體制，但由於當前經濟情勢的惡化，「形勢比人強」，又怎能反對各地發行銀元券的建議呢？</p>
<p>由於各地發行銀元券的呼聲，甚囂塵上，有識之士，深恐區域經濟的抬頭，演成經濟割據和分裂的局面，故多主張政府從速發行銀元券，一方面是鑒於金圓券本身已瀕近崩潰的邊緣，不如趁早改革，以挽救經濟的厄運，另一方面則為了順時應變，免得在漩渦中再有風浪，這一部份的意見，可以立委丘漢平等氏代表，而且他們已在立法院院會中幾度提出廣泛的討論。</p>
<p>同時據聞中央銀行業務局副局長王紫霜氏以前出席立法院財經審查委員會的時候，曾帶去了該行擬定的發行銀元券辦法，又聞該辦法已得到了財經審查會的支持，一經完成立法程序，卽可見諸實施，預計時間並不太遠；而另一種的傳說，當局對發行銀元券已在準備中，將來是否採兌現制，尚未有所決定，我們綜合各方的報導，顯然銀元券的發行，已如箭在弦上了。</p>
<p>談到發行銀元券，事實上並不是一件簡單的事情：第一，須有充份的準備金。第二，須絕對與財政隔絕，切不可予取予求。第三，須維持無限制的兌現制，以鞏固信用。第四，須由中央銀行以外的超然地位的金融機構來主持發行，方能使人民懷疑的態度，改變過來。第五，發行機構的旁枝機構，須遍佈全國，藉能使銀元券廣泛地流通。第六，幣值須絕對保持穩定，與黃金，外匯及一般物價，保持均衡的關係。其中如缺少一項因素，則銀元券的本身，便不能健全，徒然平添了另一種的擾民工具。</p>
<p>實則今日財政金融的紊亂局面，我們以為並不能完全歸咎於幣制的本身，卽如以前的法幣和今日的金圓券，都是屬於管理通貨一類的不兌現的紙幣，在貨幣理論上不能謂為落伍的制度，但它們失敗的基本原因，還是在於政治的大前提之上；因為現在金圓券的發行權完全操在政府的掌握裏，所以如果戰事一日不停，財政一日不能平衡，則金圓券的需求也是一日不會滿足的。我們猶憶金圓券改革時轟轟烈烈的塲面，當時當局如能繼續控制發行下去，那裏會有今日的慘象！所以我們以為在發行銀元券以前，如不把幾個大的原則認淸，則法幣和金圓券前車之鑒，尚在眼前，否則，恐怕要落到「今之視昔，亦猶後之視今」的命運上去，幣政大事，事前能不攷慮周詳？</p>
<p>最近幾十年來，人民在苦海裏經過了許多次的大風浪，也經過了許多次的幣制變革，所以人民每次談到幣制改革時，莫不談虎色變，尤其在金圓券改革不久的今日，再來談幣制改革，真是一件絕頂困難的事，故我們主張這次的銀圓券改革，必須要採十足兌現制，雖然在銀元流出的時候，不免存珍惜的心理，但在今日的局勢下，非此不足以挽回人心，此點實是新幣制成敗的關鍵，千萬不可放鬆。至於主持發行的機構，必須是中央銀行以外的超然性金融機構，才能一新耳目，並且不受財政的牽制，而獲得全國人民的信仰與支持。</p>
<p>銀元券發行的初期，金圓券作為輔幣流通，祇可作為一時權宜之計，其與銀元券比值不定，亦為困難之點，但銀元在現階段的單位，似嫌過大，民間使用起來，殊多不便，故銀元輔幣，必須同時準備，以免金圓券初行時的困難重現，至於為求各省貨幣購買力適應自然水準起見，亦可加蓋各省地名，但在流通的區域內，並無軒輊之分。</p>
<p>發行銀元券的機構，原則上自宜以全國的商業銀行組織聯合準備庫，以充裕準備金，增厚信用，但是事實上亦不免有所困難，諸如多數商業銀行的不健全，其本身能否獲得人民的信仰，不無疑問？又商業銀行的分支機構有限，不能負起調劑全國金融的任務，同時商業銀行的幫別很多，賢愚不齊，一旦遇有金融風潮，發生動搖情事時，恐反貽誤幣政大事，此尤係不容忽視之處。</p>
<p>其次，我們從各方面審察當前最適宜發行銀元券的金融機構，恐怕要推中國銀行和交通銀行了，我們所以要這樣選擇的理由，不外下列數點：（一）中交兩行均有四十年以上的悠久歷史，在一般印象中較為深刻。（二）中交兩行分支機構遍佈國內外，對於銀元券的兌現，很為便利。（三）中交兩行的資本，僅次於中央銀行，而超駕一般商業行莊之上，資力不可謂不雄厚。（四）中交兩行雖有官股的存在，實係民營官督的銀行，可以不受財政上的影響，實處於超然的地位。（五）中交兩行，在北京政府時代，極力維持兌現，因之民間對它們的信仰，甚為濃厚，卽如民國廿年左右中央銀行發生擠兌風潮時，兩行非但不受牽動，且能幫助中央銀行平息風潮，可見一斑。目前情形，與過去頗多類似，故就客觀看法，宜由兩行主持發行銀元券，寗非無因。</p>
<p>但從統一發行以來，中交兩行的生金銀和銀元·外匯等，都已移交與中央銀行，目前兩行所掌握的，實際仍是金圓券，如銀元券交由兩行發行，則準備金的籌集，亦很困難，故目前中央銀行應將兩行前存的生金銀和銀元·外匯等，全部撥還兩行，作為兌現的準備，以維持兌現，鞏固信用，不過在兩行主持發行的時候，須由全國各地民意機構推派代表，組織銀元券發行監理會，隨時抽查發行數目及基金動用情形，發表公告，以昭大信於天下，這樣不管大局前途的發展是如何，人民當能避免人頭稅似的通貨膨脹了。</p>
<p>事實上銀元券的發行權，倘能完全交給中交兩行，而由民意代表來監督發行的話，確是當前最理想，最切實際的措施，也是人民自己維持自己生活方式的一種辦法，同時由於兩行立塲的超然，則嗣後發行可不受國庫的牽累，也不致引起地方幣的醞釀，形成各自為政的病態，多少是動亂時期經濟上的一大成就。</p>
<p>再說銀元券本身因有充份的準備，而且無限制的兌現，所以幣值絕對穩定，一切交易，自可恢復正常狀態，金價，物價，匯價，也都可維持均衡的關係，而且銀元券只要與金元券維持一個不定值的比例，仍舊不防碍金圓券的流通，況在銀元券使用之後，銀元存款，勢必普遍的增加，無疑的要增厚行莊的力量，及打擊投機囤戶的活動，由此也可以解救金融，抑制物價，安定民生了。</p>
<h3>東西間疑雲迷霧逐漸消除　四外長會門戶洞開　美發表公報說明今後與蘇聯談判焦點　英深信七月前將舉行會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播：英官方稱：如果蘇聯對解除柏林封鎖之建議並不附帶不能接受之條件，則四強外長會議可能在七月一日以前召開。據悉，英政府贊成召開四強外長會議，討論德國問題，但以蘇聯不提出難以接受之條件為前提。不擬繼續討論此問題。自後西方各國仍覓取任何足以表示蘇聯政府改變其態度之點，而努力探求與蘇聯官員接觸之可能性。一九四九年一月三十日史達林答覆美記者之詢問時，並未提及柏林之幣制問題，此點使國務部頗為注意，蓋此舉表示該問題有探討之可能，故當時美國駐安理會代理代表傑塞普，曾於二月十五日與蘇聯代表馬立克會談，探詢史達林之不談幣制問題，是否具有任何特殊意義。逾一月後，至三月十五日，馬立克通知傑塞普謂：史氏之不提及幣制問題，並非「意外」，蘇聯政府雖認為此為一重要問題。但感覺若能召開外長會議，會商整個德國問題，則此事可在外長會議中討論。傑塞普詢問此舉是否表示蘇聯政府準備在柏林繼續封鎖下進行外長會議，抑先解除封鎖。關於蘇聯政府在此種非正式談判中所表示之態度，美政府皆曾通知英法兩政府。三月二十一日，馬立克邀傑氏前往謂，對召開外長會議若能確定日期，則蘇方將解除柏林封鎖及對貿易之限制，作為交換條件，且在會議開始前，解除封鎖。國務部籍英·法兩外長在美之便，卽與彼等討論蘇聯態度最近之發展，而獲得一致之意見。四月五日，傑塞普卽以三國所擬之聲明向馬氏宣讀，以免蘇聯對此事發生誤會。此聲明之目的，乃闡明討論之焦點為：</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯解除其在一九四八年三月一日起實施對交通運輸，及柏林與西德間貿易之一切限制，西方三國亦同時解除對交通運輸及與東德貿易之一切限制。</p>
<p>（二）確定舉行四國外長會議之日期。</p>
<p>西方各國欲確知蘇聯日後不復將此二點包括於拒絕解除柏林封鎖之理由中。聲明中又綜述三國所了解之蘇聯對解除封鎖及召開外長會議所取之態度，此舉之目的，為確知蘇聯政府所取之立塲，與塔斯社所發表者相同。四月十日，馬立克復邀傑塞普前往，重申蘇聯政府之立塲，自馬氏發表之聲明觀之，仍有數點需予澄淸。</p>
<h3>三強在西德　設立新機構</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕廿五日三強總督與西德領袖議定之憲法實施以後，將以盟國高級委員會為盟國管制西德之最高機構，該項協定係由三國外長貝文，艾契遜，許曼於四月八日在此間簽訂。該協定並規定在佔領法規生效之前，卽使英·美·法三佔領區合併，高級委員會之權限，將與佔領法規及國際協定相符合。三強此外又公布一協定，規定阜登堡巴登邦之公民投票將延期舉行，以免防碍德國聯邦之成立。關於法國參加萊茵河岸基爾港之問題，三強亦議定，在德國聯邦政府成立，及關於該港之行政談判結束以前，仍繼續由法國保持對該港之管制。</p>
<h3>加國會下週解散　儘可能舉行普選</h3>

<h3>美將逐漸放鬆　對日管理政策</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿七日電〕麥帥總部參謀長阿孟道少將，廿六日曾在此間美僑商會午餐會上發表演說，表示美佔領軍當局卽將逐漸放寬對日本之管理政策，今後日本國民應卽準備自己來處理其本國各項事務。</p>
<h3>傑塞普與馬立克　正舉行秘密會議　傳柏林蘇軍已準備解除封鎖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿七日廣播：美不定大使傑塞普於廿七日下午十二時半往晤蘇駐聯合國代表馬立克商談解除柏林封鎖問題。傑氏告記者稱：關於結束東西冷戰之會談情形，將於今後在成功湖美國總部發表聲明。</p>
<p>〔合眾社成功湖廿七日電〕美國及蘇聯計劃在廿七日舉行秘密會議，討論結束柏林封鎖問題，美國駐聯合國代表傑塞普，將在紐約某地（可能係馬立克在蒙漢頓的辦公處）會晤蘇聯代表馬立克，覓取解除柏林封鎖的方式，並討論召開四強對德會議的計劃。</p>
<p>國務部在與杜魯門總統磋商後宣稱：「結束柏林封鎖及召開四強外長會議，前途殊有希望」。雖然，如果柏林封鎖一旦解除，東西間的冷戰將大事減輕，但國務卿艾契遜仍力促參院外交委員會從速批准大西洋公約。傑·馬會談雖將秘密舉行，但其結果可望由傑塞普及美國代表團嗣後在此間宣布。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿六日電〕與柏林蘇高級官員接近之德人透露，蘇官員確信柏林之封鎖及盟國之反封鎖，不久卽可解除。蘇軍總部頃自莫斯科接獲命令，囑立卽開始解除封鎖之一切技術準備。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕柏林之西方觀察家，則認蘇聯正從事最後企圖，以延遲西德國之成立。英外交部發言人稱：塔斯社所宣佈美蘇間就德國問題之接洽，乃屬探討性質，刻尚在繼續進行中。塔斯社所報導者，雖不詳盡，但尚正確。英政府當就此事與美·法政府保持接觸。</p>
<h3>中國局勢發展　將威脅韓國</h3>
<p>李承晚將請求美暫援撤軍</p>
<p>〔合眾社漢城廿七日電〕此間韓國政府人仕認為，共黨控制的中國，對韓國將是一種直接的威脅。據接近韓國政府的人仕揣測：目前中國局勢的激變，將促使李承晚政府要求美國重行考慮在以後數月內撤退駐南韓美軍的預定計劃。</p>
<h3>印宣布為獨立共和國後　同意參加英聯邦　印將繼續承認英王為聯邦元首</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕英王喬治六世，今日在白金漢宮接見共和聯邦總理八人，聆取印度共和國參加共和聯邦之新公式，該項公式規定印度於八月十五日宣布為共和國後，英王將繼續為印度共和國之最高公民。</p>
<p>一般皆認此乃英國及共和聯邦之一重大勝利。外交界人士認為，印度之得同意在英王之下繼續參加英共和聯邦，乃工黨開明政策之結果，若在保守黨秉政之下，印度必將完全脫離英共和聯邦，且此例一開，則已完全脫離共和聯邦之緬甸及愛爾蘭，亦可在不損其共和國地位之原則下，重新加入共和聯邦。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕英共和聯邦史上今日已產生了新的一頁，印度已同意於宣布為獨立共和國外，繼續為英共合聯邦之一員。印度並已承認英王為共合聯邦之元首，故印度總統宣誓就職時，仍將作效忠英王及共和聯邦的廣泛表示。</p>

<h3>President Chiang's Message to the Nation: Accept Lessons, Strive for Comprehensive Reform, Unite and Fight for Final Victory</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xikou, 27th] President Chiang recently issued a message to the nation, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen! Now the Communist bandits have forcibly crossed the Yangtze River, and Nanjing has already been evacuated. Our patriotic soldiers and civilians fought bravely for eight years, and the capital recovered from the iron hooves of Japanese warlords has fallen into the iron curtain of the Communist International after less than four years. Today, facing this dark violence that ravages the freedom of the people, destroys national independence, and threatens world peace, the life and death of every citizen are inextricably linked to the survival of the entire nation. Although I, Chiang Kai-shek, have retired to private life, as a member of the nation, I still feel a great responsibility for the country's crisis and the suffering of my compatriots. At this time of anxiety and turmoil, I reiterate my determination to share weal and woe with my fellow countrymen and offer my sincere words to my patriotic soldiers and civilians.</p>
<p>During the war against Japan, our only major problem was to persevere in the war and strive for victory. After the victory of the war, the Communist Party problem became our only major problem. Therefore, as soon as the war against Japan came to an end, I exhausted all my efforts to find a political solution. We know that the Communist Party problem is an international problem and cannot be solved by China alone. However, at that time, we believed that if this problem could be solved peacefully by China itself or by the international community, the fruits of the war could be preserved, the people could recuperate, national construction could proceed smoothly, and world peace and security would not be threatened. Therefore, our government at that time, with the greatest sincerity, spared no effort to make concessions, convened a Political Consultative Conference, accepted American military mediation, and issued cease-fire orders four times to promote the success of a peaceful settlement. Unexpectedly, after more than a year of negotiations and mediation, the Communist Party not only showed no sincerity in seeking peace, but also intensified its perverse actions, using the cover of peaceful talks and military mediation, and the opportunity of the cease-fire with the National Army, to advance into the Northeast, obstruct the National Army from taking over the sovereignty of the Northeast, and cross the Yellow River southward to expand the war in the Central Plains. At this point, the government had no choice but to take military action and actively suppress the bandits. At the time of establishing the suppression policy, we knew that if the suppression military operations could not achieve success within one or two years, not only would the people's suffering deepen like water, but also Asian security and world peace would be seriously affected. Our China would become the battlefield of the Third World War, and the world's humanity would suffer unprecedented calamities together. Therefore, the government concentrated its forces, mobilized for war, and strived to implement the suppression policy and complete military operations quickly, in order to save the country from danger and eliminate human warfare. However, due to our political and military shortcomings, the misunderstanding of people at home and abroad, and the infiltration of Communist Party propaganda and espionage activities, our internal affairs, diplomacy, and morale could not adapt to the needs of suppression mobilization, which led to the serious situation today.</p>
<h3>The Democratic Nations Cannot Shirk Responsibility for the Evolution of the Serious Situation</h3>
<p>This year, on New Year's Day, I reiterated the policy of peacefully resolving the Chinese Communist problem and retired to private life in order to promote the realization of peace. In the past three months, Acting President Li endured humiliation and bore heavy burdens, dealing with the Communists, making concessions and seeking complete accommodation. However, during this period, the Communist Party openly issued a declaration to help Soviet Russia in the Third World War, exposing its face as an international fifth column. Then, it put forward its so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" of eight articles and twenty-four clauses, forcing our national army to disarm and surrender to the bandits, removing the guarantees of our national independence and people's freedom. Finally, it issued its general attack order, broke through our Yangtze River defense line, and launched a large-scale invasion of the south of the Yangtze River. This time, the Communist Party's destruction of peaceful negotiations and continued expansion of the chaos with a violent and dictatorial attitude completely proves that its purpose is not peace, but war. More precisely, its purpose is not for China's peace and people's livelihood, but for the invasion and conquest of China. It wants to turn my 12 million square kilometers of territory into a base for the Communist International in the Third World War, to use my 450 million compatriots as cannon fodder for the Third World War, to destroy my Chinese nation's 5,000 years of noble and excellent history and culture without leaving any trace, and to transform our Chinese ethics based on love and peace into cold and cruel struggle, participating in international massacres. The evolution of this serious situation has always been in our agonizing thoughts. This is not only a critical moment for the survival of China, but also the democratic countries of the world cannot avoid its impact, nor can they shirk their due responsibilities.</p>
<p>I am Willing to Follow the Soldiers and Civilians in Struggle in a Private Capacity</p>
<p>Compatriots! We have seen through the Communist bandits' conspiracy to destroy the motherland and sell out the nation. We have learned the lessons of the two failures of peaceful negotiations. We can only unite and fight back with one heart and soul against the tyrannical and brutal advance of the bandits. Our current situation is certainly dangerous, and our future battles will also be arduous. However, we recognize that today's bandit suppression war is a national war against aggression, a democratic war against totalitarianism, and also a social war for the free way of life of every citizen and every family, and a cultural war to protect our long history, excellent culture, and peaceful and loving ethics and morality. The final outcome of this war will determine the survival of the entire country, and will determine the life, death, fortune, and misfortune of every citizen and family. If this anti-aggression war fails, the country's independent and free status and the people's free way of life will be destroyed. Our future will only be widespread poverty, cold hunger, and world war. If this anti-aggression and anti-communist war can succeed, then the country will be an independent country, the people will be free people, and it will make a glorious contribution to world peace and security. At this moment of life and death for the country and the nation, I am willing to follow my patriotic soldiers and civilians in a private capacity, support Acting President Li and Premier He in leading the war, and fight to the end. Now this war has begun! Today, we can only be under one government, with our attitude towards the Communists as the touchstone of loyalty and treachery. All anti-communist policies must be thoroughly implemented, and all bandit suppression orders must be absolutely obeyed. Today, we can only stand together under the great cause of the nation, regardless of occupation or class, regardless of personal grievances, all those who are unwilling to be slaves of the Communist International, who cannot sit idly by and watch the demise of the nation's history and culture, who cannot sit idly by and watch the loss of ancestral tombs and fields, and the separation of families, husbands, wives, and children, all those who are anti-communist, anti-aggression, and anti-totalitarianism, unite sincerely, concentrate our strength, concentrate our will, never give up, and fight to the end. I firmly believe that we will be able to overcome the current crisis and achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Remove Dependency Mentality, Wash Away Wishful Thinking</p>
<p>Compatriots, our China was originally a poor and weak country, but it is indeed an independent great power in the East Asian continent, and it has a glorious and unparalleled history of fighting for national independence, national freedom, and for democratic peace. Today, our suppression of the Communists is to fight for independence and freedom and for the survival of every individual, and also to fight for world security and human happiness. Today, we stand at the forefront of anti-aggression and act as the vanguard of the world's anti-communist struggle, regardless of the Communist International's slander and the democratic countries' perceptions. We believe that there will always be justice in the world, and mankind must uphold justice. As long as we do our best, we will certainly not be alone in the international community. However, we must remove the mentality of dependence, and especially wash away the mentality of wishful thinking. The Chinese Communists have already issued a declaration on April 4, solemnly vowing to help Soviet Russia in the Third World War. They have no national consciousness or national thought at all, and they have no love or sense of responsibility for the motherland and compatriots. After the two failures of peaceful negotiations, we must never imagine that the Communist bandits will change their policies, nor can we hope that there is still a possibility of peaceful compromise. We must know that Mao Zedong is willing to depend on the Communist International and act as a tool for the expansionist policies of aggressive countries. His treachery is the same as that of Wang Jingwei, but his background is deeper and his behavior is more sinister, far beyond what Wang Jingwei can compare. Wang Jingwei lost confidence in the war of resistance and surrendered to the Japanese warlords during the period when our war of resistance against Japan suffered setbacks, in order to seek a place for his personal survival. But today's Mao Zedong, after our war of resistance has been victorious, the country's independent and autonomous status has been established, construction projects are sprouting and growing, and the people's lives are about to move towards restoration and progress, unexpectedly lost his mind and frantically led his Communist bandits to painstakingly destroy the fruits of the victory of the war of resistance, undermine the country's independent and autonomous status, obstruct the country's construction, and hinder the people's restoration and recuperation, willing to use China's territorial sovereignty as a sacrifice for his betrayal and seeking glory. Every step he takes and every action he takes is to implement international conspiracies and carry out arrogant ambitions. How can Wang Jingwei be expected to reach his level? Today, facing this unprecedented culprit in 5,000 years of history, we can only restore our revolutionary spirit, exert our own strength, grasp the weaknesses of the bandit army, and continue to fight to the end. Otherwise, if we have a slight dependence, we will only be indolent and let others slaughter us. If we compromise halfway, we will only surrender, and we will only be beheaded and seek our own destruction.</p>
<p>Unwavering Belief in Saving the Country and the People, Military, Government, and People United as One, The Opportunity to Turn Danger into Safety is Today</p>
<p>We admit the repeated failures in the Northeast and North China in the past. We anticipate that the current situation may worsen, but we will never be discouraged or disappointed. We must know that our past failures were not because the strength of the bandit army was so strong, but because of our political shortcomings, economic panic, and loose internal organization, which allowed the Communist bandits to take advantage of the gaps, so they were able to recklessly ambush spies between our front-line troops and the rear civilians, and spread the poison of defeatism to disintegrate morale and morale, so the National Army, with its superior military strength, suffered serious setbacks instead. I, Chiang Kai-shek, should bear a major responsibility for the past political and economic defects and the failure of the bandit suppression military operations, which caused our compatriots to suffer the ravages and massacres of the Communist bandits and fall into the iron curtain of communism, living this dark hell life, because my understanding of the Communist Party's conspiracies and atrocities is particularly profound, so my guilt is particularly painful for the country's difficulties and the people's disasters. However, I will never waver in my belief in saving the country and the people, and I am sure that we will be able to save my fellow countrymen from the communist iron curtain and regain the realm of freedom and well-being. The ancients said: "Lose in the east, gain in the west." Today, as long as my fellow countrymen across the country rise up together, support the government, and urge the government to make timely reforms in politics and have a certain direction in the economy, and the military and government cadres can thoroughly awaken and strengthen the organization, as long as we accept the lessons of failure, make failure a tempering and refining, achieve the effect of washing our hearts and renewing our faces in politics, achieve the merit of eliminating the weak and retaining the strong in the military, and integrate the excellent talents of military and political affairs with the people's self-defense activities, opening up a vast source of strength for the bandit suppression military force, I firmly believe that the opportunity for our country to turn danger into safety is today, when the Communist bandits cross the river and penetrate deeply.</p>
<p>Compatriots, we must also know that crossing the river is the highest peak of the bandit army's development, and at the same time it is the exposure of the bandit party's greatest weakness. In other words, it is the beginning of his failure. Of course, after the bandit army crosses the river, our people in South China will encounter the same darkness and pain as our compatriots in North China and the Northeast, but the brightness and final victory of our country and people's future is also here, because in terms of strategy and tactics, the Communist bandits have followed the same path as the Japanese warlords' invasion of the south and falling into the quagmire. The reason why Japan was eager to invade the south was to realize its dream of controlling the whole of China before the Second World War, and today's fifth column of the Third International, the Communist bandits, also delusionally want to control the whole of China before the Third World War, so as to replenish the Communist International's manpower, material resources, and resources to cope with the world war, making the same mistake as the Japanese warlords. The casting of this big mistake is the gene for his self-destruction, and it is also the guarantee for our China's final victory in suppressing the Communists. After the victory of the war of resistance, I said to the Shanghai Mass Rally: "We have to fight hard for another eight years, using the same spirit as the past eight years of war of resistance to prepare for sacrifice and endure suffering, so that we can achieve true victory and success." I said this for today. Compatriots, do not be discouraged, do not be pessimistic, as long as you rise up and are determined to fight, the Communist bandits will not be able to destroy our country, nor can they enslave ourselves. In less than three years, the final victory will surely be ours.</p>
<p>Accept the Leadership of the Acting President, Obey the Command of Minister He</p>
<p>Compatriots, the danger of the country's demise and the individual's disaster are very urgent, and the reasons why the Communist bandits will be defeated and the anti-communists will win are also very clear. The battle to save the country and save ourselves has already begun. Eleven years ago, the evacuation of Nanjing and the westward movement of the government were the starting point of our government's long-term war of resistance against Japan. Today, the evacuation of Nanjing and the southward movement of the government have become the only turning point in our China's anti-communist struggle. It is hoped that our soldiers and civilians across the country will accept the leadership of Acting President Li, and all officers and soldiers will absolutely obey the command of Minister He, eliminate the mentality of defeatism, exert all available strength, support the sacred and solemn war against aggression, anti-communism, seeking survival, seeking freedom, saving the country, and protecting democracy, and achieve the realm of final success. I, Chiang Kai-shek, have led the National Army and served the government for more than 20 years. The faults and omissions are seen by the people of the country and are guilty in my heart. However, I am confident that my loyalty to the country and love for the people can be testified to by heaven and earth without shame. At this critical moment of the country's survival, the nation's life and death, and the continuation of history and culture, I will always be consistent, follow my patriotic soldiers and civilians across the country, do my best, exterminate the fifth column of the Communist International - the Communist bandits, promote the revival of the Chinese nation, restore the independence, democracy, and freedom of the Republic of China, and realize the Three Principles of the People to complete the national revolution. Final success belongs to those who make the final effort. I hope my fellow countrymen across the country will encourage each other.</p>
<h3>US ECA Materials Suspended from Shipping to Shanghai, Relief Rice Continues to be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 26th] According to officials of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) here, the shipment of materials to Shanghai under the US ECA's aid-to-China program has been suspended. Cleveland, director of the agency's China program group, revealed today that 8 million U.S. dollars worth of raw cotton, now packaged in 17 ships, is en route to Shanghai. Five of these ships have already been diverted to Kobe, Japan, and it is expected that the remaining ships will also first head to Japan and then possibly to other Far Eastern regions that can use cotton. Although the ECA has stopped shipping materials to Shanghai, it will continue its aid program in areas of China not under Communist Party control. Supplies will be shipped to Guangzhou, Shantou, and Taiwan. The main materials shipped to Taiwan are chemical fertilizers, as Taiwan does not need food. Materials shipped to other areas will include rice, petroleum products, fertilizers, and some raw cotton.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] The United States today stopped shipping cotton to Shanghai, but US aid to Shanghai in the form of relief rice continues to be shipped, but it is not certain how long it can be maintained. According to Economic Cooperation Administration personnel, once the Communists occupy Shanghai, the transport of grain and other supplies to the area will automatically cease. Congress recently passed a continuing appropriation of $54 million in aid to China, stipulating that it be used only in non-Communist areas. The ECA stipulates that Shanghai has 12,671,000 yuan worth of relief supplies, including cotton, fertilizer, flour, and rice.</p>

<h3>Attlee Reports to the House of Commons; Britain Takes a Reserved Stance on the Communist Army's Shelling of British Warships; Churchill and Others Raise Questions</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] Prime Minister Attlee told a crowded and tense House of Commons that due to the still turbulent situation in China, Britain reserves its position on the incident in which four British warships were shelled by the communist army in the Yangtze River, causing significant casualties.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 26th] Prime Minister Attlee stated in the House of Commons on the 26th that Britain will take all possible steps to protect British nationals in China. However, Britain will continue to adhere to the US-British-Soviet Moscow Agreement of 1945 regarding the Chinese situation and adopt a policy of non-interference. Conservative Party leader Churchill and many other members of parliament raised questions and attacked the Labor government regarding the communist army's shelling of four British warships in the Yangtze River. Labor members shouted "The Conservative Party wants war" to drown out various questions.</p>
<p>Churchill stated that the Yangtze River incident was an outrage, and the government should have delegated all responsibility to the Commander of the British Navy in China and sent an aircraft carrier for an effective counterattack. The government should take decisive steps to ensure that we are respected in the future.</p>
<p>Attlee explained that the British warship "Amethyst" entered the war zone with "correct" procedures. The other warships were heading to rescue the "Amethyst" and had no other mission, and there was no question of suppression. The British warships only opened fire to destroy the troops shelling them.</p>
<p>Attlee's explanation failed to satisfy the questioners, and some Labor members also expressed dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] Prime Minister Attlee revealed in Parliament on the 26th that Yu De, a secretary at the British Embassy in Nanjing who went to the communist area on the opposite bank of Nanjing to negotiate a cessation of shelling of British warships, revealed that the central authorities were prepared to allow the British warship "Amethyst" to sail to Nanjing, but the warship must assist the communist army in crossing the river. Attlee said this condition was clearly unacceptable to Britain.</p>

Hong Kong is a trading hub and a democratic showcase for the Far East. Despite the rapid population increase, it still maintains the highest living standards in the Far East. Williams made the remarks while welcoming a Hong Kong trade delegation attending the British Labor Party Congress. He said that the world's attention is now focused on China, where the people are in a state of disorder, major cities have fallen into chaos, and millions of men, women, and children are homeless. Fortunately, there is still Hong Kong, a small place, but still a center of prosperity and peace.</p>

<h3>Essay: The Problem of Issuing Silver Dollar Vouchers</h3>
<p>— He Shiqi</p>
<p>The greater the extent of the Gold Yuan's inflation, the more rampant the rise in prices, this is an inevitable phenomenon, especially in the last two days, prices have risen day by day, and the Gold Yuan is constantly depreciating, clearly it has lost its monetary function. But if we reflect, who exactly is to blame for the Gold Yuan ending up with such a tragic fate? Originally, using issuance as a cash cow, as a balance for public finance, is an unwise plan, to know that the credit of paper money is completely based on general belief, if you do not control credit, and create purchasing power without limit, of course you cannot blame the people for no longer using it as a store of value and a means of exchange.</p>
<p>Now, from a legal point of view, the Gold Yuan is still the only legal tender, but looking at the general practical situation in society, the Gold Yuan has undoubtedly been reduced to a kind of subsidiary currency for silver dollars, this phenomenon has long been rampant among the people, this goes without saying, even from the official perspective, such as the army issuing salaries in silver dollars, the income and expenditure of provinces and cities such as Yunnan, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Fuzhou, and Lanzhou, have all openly adopted silver dollars as a unit, the fare for Hunan highway buses, is also based on the price of silver dollars, the central bank even gives out a portion of silver dollars when paying its banking associates, as the trend develops, silver dollars have indeed taken over the position of the Gold Yuan. However, until the government formally recognizes its status, it is still a contradictory phenomenon, with many latent difficulties, for example, when soldiers receive their salaries in silver dollars, it is difficult for banks to cope with requests to deposit or remit them, and there are many inconveniences in pricing goods in Gold Yuan, the facts are like this, there is no need to avoid it, therefore, the government should promptly recognize the legal status of silver dollars, so that banks can develop silver dollar deposits and other things, and prices everywhere can directly use silver dollars as a unit, to avoid the continued disruption of general economic life by unstable currencies.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been much debate over the choice between the silver dollar standard and the Gold Yuan standard, the focus of the problem is no longer whether the silver standard is outdated, but the issue of local and central issuance rights, and the status of the Gold Yuan, this fact is very obvious, such as the past brewing of local authorities in Changsha, Hankou, and other places to issue silver dollar vouchers, the half-value silver dollar auxiliary currency vouchers issued by Yunnan Fudian New Bank, and the silver dollars cast and circulated by the Gansu Mint, although the motions in Changsha and Hankou have not become a reality, the measures in Yunnan and Gansu, after all, the government also has to acquiesce to in fact.</p>
<p>Regarding the suggestions for local authorities to issue local currency everywhere, it is still going on, not only has the Guangxi Provincial Assembly been doing its best to urge the local authorities to issue silver dollar vouchers, but at the same time, the Chongqing Provincial Assembly has even advocated that the five provinces and cities of Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Chongqing jointly issue silver dollar vouchers for the southwest region, and use them directly within the region, that is, the provincial and municipal governments and public and private banks of the region invest in the establishment of a joint reserve, set aside enough funds, to prepare for the preparation of cash, so that the economy of the five provinces and cities, can not be constrained by the turmoil of the overall situation; in addition, the speaker of this city's provincial assembly, Pan Gongzhan, and the representative of the city's chamber of commerce, Yan Esheng, recently suggested at a reception by the city government that commercial banks and enterprises store enough reserves to issue local vouchers, and it is heard that they have obtained the support of acting Mayor Chen on the spot. All of these are the forerunners of forming regional economic barriers, although the government is determined to maintain the Gold Yuan system under this situation, but due to the deterioration of the current economic situation, "the situation is stronger than the people", how can it oppose the proposal for local authorities to issue silver dollar vouchers?</p>
<p>Due to the clamor for local authorities to issue silver dollar vouchers, people with knowledge of the situation are deeply afraid that the rise of regional economies will evolve into a situation of economic separation and division, so they mostly advocate that the government should issue silver dollar vouchers as soon as possible, on the one hand, it is because the Gold Yuan itself is on the verge of collapse, it is better to reform as soon as possible to save the economic disaster, on the other hand, it is to adapt to the times and avoid further turbulence in the vortex, this part of the opinion can be represented by legislator Qiu Hanping and others, and they have repeatedly proposed extensive discussions in the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is heard that when Wang Zishuang, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, previously attended the Financial and Economic Review Committee of the Legislative Yuan, he brought the bank's proposed method for issuing silver dollar vouchers, and it is also heard that the method has been supported by the Financial and Economic Review Committee, and once the legislative process is completed, it can be seen in practice, and the estimated time is not too far; and another rumor is that the authorities are preparing to issue silver dollar vouchers, and whether to adopt a cash system in the future has not yet been decided, we combine the reports from all sides, it is clear that the issuance of silver dollar vouchers is already imminent.</p>
<p>Talking about issuing silver dollar vouchers, in fact, it is not a simple matter: First, there must be sufficient reserves. Second, it must be absolutely separated from public finance, and must not be allowed to be taken at will. Third, it must maintain an unlimited cash system to consolidate credit. Fourth, the issuance must be presided over by a financial institution in a transcendent position outside the Central Bank, so that the people's attitude of doubt can be changed. Fifth, the branch institutions of the issuing institution must be spread all over the country, so that the silver dollar vouchers can be widely circulated. Sixth, the value of the currency must be absolutely stable, and maintain a balanced relationship with gold, foreign exchange, and general prices. If one of these factors is missing, then the silver dollar voucher itself cannot be sound, and it will only add another tool to disturb the people.</p>
<p>In fact, we believe that the chaotic situation of public finance and finance today cannot be completely attributed to the monetary system itself, just like the previous legal currency and today's Gold Yuan, both belong to the category of managed currency, non-cash paper money, in monetary theory can not be said to be an outdated system, but the fundamental reason for their failure, is still on the political major premise; because now the right to issue Gold Yuan is completely in the hands of the government, so if the war does not stop for a day, and public finance cannot be balanced for a day, then the demand for Gold Yuan will not be satisfied for a day. We still remember the grand scene of the Gold Yuan reform, if the authorities could continue to control the issuance at that time, how could there be today's tragic situation! Therefore, we believe that before issuing silver dollar vouchers, if we do not recognize several major principles clearly, then the lessons of the legal currency and the Gold Yuan are still before our eyes, otherwise, I am afraid that we will fall into the fate of "the present looks at the past, and the future looks at the present", can we not consider the major events of currency policy thoroughly in advance?</p>
<p>In recent decades, the people have experienced many great storms in the sea of suffering, and have also experienced many currency system changes, so every time people talk about currency system reform, they all turn pale at the mention of it, especially today, when the Gold Yuan reform is not long ago, it is really an extremely difficult thing to talk about currency system reform again, so we advocate that this silver dollar voucher reform must adopt a full cash system, although there will inevitably be a psychology of cherishing it when the silver dollar flows out, but under today's situation, this is the only way to regain the people's hearts, this point is the key to the success or failure of the new currency system, and must not be relaxed. As for the institution presiding over the issuance, it must be a transcendent financial institution outside the Central Bank in order to refresh people's eyes and ears, and not be constrained by public finance, and obtain the belief and support of the people throughout the country.</p>
<p>In the initial stage of issuing silver dollar vouchers, the Gold Yuan circulating as an auxiliary currency can only be regarded as a temporary expedient, and the unstable ratio between it and the silver dollar voucher is also a difficulty, but the unit of the silver dollar seems to be too large in the current stage, and it is very inconvenient for the people to use it, so silver dollar auxiliary currencies must be prepared at the same time to avoid the difficulties when the Gold Yuan was first issued, as for the sake of adapting the purchasing power of currencies in various provinces to natural levels, the names of the provinces can also be stamped on them, but there is no difference in the area of circulation.</p>
<p>The institution that issues silver dollar vouchers, in principle, should organize a joint reserve with the national commercial bank organizations to enrich the reserves and increase credit, but in fact, there are inevitably some difficulties, such as the unsoundness of most commercial banks, and there is no doubt whether they themselves can gain the belief of the people? Moreover, the branch institutions of commercial banks are limited, and they cannot assume the task of regulating the finances of the whole country, and at the same time, there are many gangs in commercial banks, with unequal wisdom, and once there is a financial storm and a shake-up, I am afraid that it will delay the major events of currency policy, this is especially a place that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Secondly, we examine from all aspects the most suitable financial institutions to issue silver dollar vouchers at present, I am afraid that we should promote the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, the reasons why we want to choose this way are nothing more than the following points: (1) Both the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have a long history of more than 40 years, and they are more deeply imprinted in the general impression. (2) Both the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have branch institutions all over the country and abroad, which is very convenient for the cashing of silver dollar vouchers. (3) The capital of both the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is second only to the Central Bank, and exceeds that of general commercial banks and enterprises, and the strength cannot be said to be not strong. (4) Although there are official shares in both the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, they are actually private banks under official supervision, and can be free from the influence of public finance, and are in a transcendent position. (5) During the Peking government era, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications did their best to maintain cash, and therefore the people's belief in them was very strong, just like when there was a run on the Central Bank around the 20th year of the Republic of China, not only were the two banks not affected, but they were able to help the Central Bank quell the turmoil, which can be seen from this. The current situation is quite similar to the past, so from an objective point of view, it is advisable for the two banks to preside over the issuance of silver dollar vouchers, it is not without reason.</p>
<p>However, since the unified issuance, the bullion and silver dollars and foreign exchange of both the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have been transferred to the Central Bank, and what the two banks currently control is actually still the Gold Yuan, if the silver dollar vouchers are handed over to the two banks for issuance, it will be very difficult to raise reserves, therefore, the Central Bank should return all the previously deposited bullion and silver dollars and foreign exchange to the two banks as a preparation for cash, in order to maintain cash, consolidate credit, but when the two banks preside over the issuance, representatives should be elected by the local public opinion institutions across the country to organize the Silver Dollar Voucher Issuance Supervisory Committee, check the number of issuances and the use of funds at any time, and issue announcements, in order to show great faith to the world, so that no matter how the future development of the overall situation is, the people will be able to avoid the poll tax-like inflation.</p>
<p>In fact, if the right to issue silver dollar vouchers can be completely handed over to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, and the issuance is supervised by representatives of public opinion, it is indeed the most ideal and practical measure at present, and it is also a way for the people to maintain their own way of life, and at the same time, because of the transcendent position of the two banks, the subsequent issuance can be free from the burden of the national treasury, and will not cause the brewing of local currency, forming a sick state of each governing its own, which is more or less a great economic achievement in the turbulent period.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because the silver dollar voucher itself has sufficient preparation and unlimited cash, the value of the currency is absolutely stable, all transactions can return to normal, and gold prices, prices, and exchange rates can all maintain a balanced relationship, and as long as the silver dollar voucher maintains an indefinite ratio with the Gold Yuan, it still does not hinder the circulation of the Gold Yuan, moreover, after the use of silver dollar vouchers, silver dollar deposits will inevitably increase, which will undoubtedly increase the strength of the banks and enterprises and crack down on the activities of speculative hoarders, from this, we can also save finance, curb prices, and stabilize people's lives.</p>
<h3>The Clouds of Doubt Between East and West Gradually Dissipate; The Four Foreign Ministers Meeting Opens Its Doors; The U.S. Issues a Statement Explaining Future Negotiation Focus with the Soviet Union; Britain Firmly Believes a Meeting Will Be Held Before July</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: British officials say: If the Soviet Union's proposal to lift the Berlin Blockade does not come with unacceptable conditions, then a Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference may be convened before July 1st. It is understood that the British government supports convening a Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the German problem, but only on the premise that the Soviet Union does not propose unacceptable conditions. It does not intend to continue discussing this issue. Since then, Western countries have continued to seek any point that could indicate a change in the Soviet government's attitude and have strived to explore the possibility of contacting Soviet officials. When Stalin answered questions from American reporters on January 30, 1949, he did not mention the Berlin currency issue. This point attracted much attention from the State Department, as it indicated that the issue could be explored. Therefore, the acting representative of the United States to the Security Council at the time, Jessup, met with the Soviet representative Malik on February 15 to inquire whether Stalin's silence on the currency issue had any special meaning. More than a month later, on March 15, Malik informed Jessup that Stalin's failure to mention the currency issue was not "accidental." Although the Soviet government considered this an important issue, it felt that if a foreign ministers conference could be convened to discuss the entire German issue, this matter could be discussed at the foreign ministers conference. Jessup asked if this meant that the Soviet government was prepared to hold a foreign ministers conference while continuing the blockade of Berlin, or whether it would lift the blockade first. The U.S. government had informed the British and French governments of the Soviet government's attitude in these informal negotiations. On March 21, Malik invited Jessup and said that if a date could be set for the convening of a foreign ministers conference, the Soviet side would lift the Berlin Blockade and restrictions on trade as an exchange condition, and would lift the blockade before the conference began. Taking advantage of the presence of the British and French foreign ministers in the United States, the State Department immediately discussed the latest developments in the Soviet attitude with them and reached a unanimous opinion. On April 5, Jessup read the statement drafted by the three countries to Malik to avoid any misunderstanding by the Soviet Union. The purpose of this statement was to clarify the focus of discussion as:</p>
<p>(1) The Soviet Union lifts all restrictions on transportation and trade between Berlin and West Germany that it has implemented since March 1, 1948, and the three Western countries simultaneously lift all restrictions on transportation and trade with East Germany.</p>
<p>(2) Confirm the date for holding the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>The Western countries wanted to be sure that the Soviet Union would no longer include these two points as reasons for refusing to lift the Berlin Blockade. The statement also summarized the three countries' understanding of the Soviet Union's attitude towards lifting the blockade and convening a foreign ministers conference. The purpose of this was to ensure that the Soviet government's position was the same as that published by TASS. On April 10, Malik again invited Jessup to reiterate the Soviet government's position. Judging from the statement issued by Malik, there were still several points that needed clarification.</p>
<h3>The Three Powers Establish a New Organization in West Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] After the implementation of the constitution agreed upon by the three powers' governors and West German leaders on the 25th, the Allied High Commission will be the highest body of Allied control over West Germany. This agreement was signed by the three foreign ministers, Bevin, Acheson, and Schuman, here on April 8. The agreement also stipulates that even before the occupation regulations come into effect, that is, after the merger of the British, American, and French occupation zones, the powers of the High Commission will be in accordance with the occupation regulations and international agreements. In addition, the three powers also announced an agreement stipulating that the plebiscite in the state of Württemberg-Baden will be postponed to avoid hindering the establishment of the German Federation. Regarding France's participation in the Kiel port on the Rhine River, the three powers also agreed that France will continue to maintain control over the port until the establishment of the German federal government and the completion of administrative negotiations on the port.</p>
<h3>Canadian Parliament to Dissolve Next Week; General Election to be Held as Soon as Possible</h3>

<h3>The U.S. Will Gradually Relax its Administrative Policies Toward Japan</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Major General Almond, Chief of Staff of MacArthur's Headquarters, gave a speech at a luncheon of the American Chamber of Commerce here on the 26th, stating that the US occupation authorities will gradually relax their administrative policies toward Japan, and the Japanese people should prepare to handle their own affairs in the future.</p>
<h3>Jessup and Malik are Holding Secret Meetings; Rumors that Soviet Troops in Berlin are Ready to Lift the Blockade</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 27th Broadcast: U.S. Ambassador Jessup met with Soviet Ambassador to the United Nations Malik at 12:30 pm on the 27th to discuss the lifting of the Berlin Blockade. Jessup told reporters that information on the talks to end the East-West Cold War will be released later at the American headquarters in Lake Success.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 27th] The United States and the Soviet Union plan to hold a secret meeting on the 27th to discuss ending the Berlin Blockade. U.S. Representative to the United Nations Jessup will meet with Soviet Representative Malik in New York (possibly at Malik's office in Manhattan) to find a way to lift the Berlin Blockade and discuss plans for a Four-Power Conference on Germany.</p>
<p>After consulting with President Truman, the State Department announced: "There is considerable hope for ending the Berlin Blockade and convening a Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference." Although, if the Berlin Blockade is lifted, the Cold War between East and West will be greatly eased, Secretary of State Acheson is still urging the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to promptly ratify the Atlantic Treaty. Although the Jessup-Malik meeting will be held in secret, its results are expected to be announced later by Jessup and the U.S. delegation here.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] Germans close to senior Soviet officials in Berlin revealed that Soviet officials are confident that the blockade of Berlin and the Allied counter-blockade will soon be lifted. Soviet military headquarters has just received orders from Moscow instructing them to immediately begin all technical preparations for lifting the blockade.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Western observers in Berlin believe that the Soviet Union is engaged in a final attempt to delay the establishment of West Germany. A British Foreign Office spokesman said: The contacts between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the German issue announced by TASS are exploratory in nature and are still ongoing. The reports by TASS, although not detailed, are accurate. The British government is maintaining contact with the U.S. and French governments on this matter.</p>
<h3>Developments in the Chinese Situation Will Threaten Korea; Syngman Rhee Will Request the U.S. to Temporarily Suspend the Withdrawal of Troops</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 27th] Sources in the South Korean government believe that a communist-controlled China will pose a direct threat to Korea. According to sources close to the South Korean government, the current drastic changes in the Chinese situation will prompt the Syngman Rhee government to ask the United States to reconsider its planned withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea in the coming months.</p>
<h3>After Announcing its Independence as a Republic, India Agrees to Join the British Commonwealth; India Will Continue to Recognize the British Monarch as Head of the Commonwealth</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] British King George VI met with eight Commonwealth prime ministers at Buckingham Palace today to hear the new formula for India's participation in the Commonwealth. The formula stipulates that after India declares itself a republic on August 15, the British monarch will continue to be the supreme citizen of the Republic of India.</p>
<p>It is generally recognized that this is a major victory for Britain and the Commonwealth. Diplomatic figures believe that India's agreement to continue to participate in the British Commonwealth under the British monarch is the result of the Labour Party's enlightened policies. If the Conservative Party had been in power, India would have completely broken away from the British Commonwealth, and once this precedent was set, Burma and Ireland, which have already completely broken away from the Commonwealth, could also rejoin the Commonwealth without compromising their republican status.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] A new page has been written in the history of the British Commonwealth today. India has agreed to continue as a member of the British Commonwealth while declaring itself an independent republic. India has also recognized the British monarch as the head of the Commonwealth, so when the President of India is sworn in, he will still make a broad statement of allegiance to the British monarch and the Commonwealth.</p>

<h3>US Secretary of the Navy Resigns; Sullivan Sends Letter to Johnson Attacking Him Vigorously; Accuses Him of Acting Autocratically and Obstructing Naval Plans</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] Secretary of the Navy Sullivan resigned today and has been approved by President Truman. Sullivan also sent a letter to the new Secretary of Defense Johnson, attacking him vigorously, accusing him of acting autocratically and obstructing the construction of the Navy's super aircraft carrier "United States," attempting to abolish the Marine Corps, and merging the Naval Aviation Corps and the Marine Corps Aviation Corps into other armies. Johnson replied, expressing regret that Sullivan had joined the dispute over the aircraft carrier construction issue for personal reasons. According to the Navy Department, it plans to build an aircraft carrier "United States" of 65,000 tons, costing 189 million US dollars, which has been approved by President Truman, but has been dismissed by Johnson. Sullivan's letter also stated that the impact of this move is unimaginable.</p>

<h3>Food Rice Unanimously Declines Due to Anxious Sellers; Medium-Grade Early Rice Retreats Below 4 Yuan</h3>
<p>Mid-quality early rice retreated below the 4 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Food rice is opened with silver dollar conversion due to lack of cash. White japonica and thin indica are initially offered at 4.7 or 4.8 yuan, but few people are interested due to the rising price of silver dollars. White japonica finally opens at 4.4 yuan, and thin indica at 4.5 yuan. Sellers are anxious to sell, and the market will fall further. White japonica closes at 4.2 yuan, thin indica at 4.3 yuan, and medium-grade early rice retreats below the 4 yuan mark, at 3.8 yuan, each falling 7 or 8 corners compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Edible oil is traded in both silver dollars and bank drafts.

Fresh vegetable oil is 14 yuan and 12 yuan in silver dollars, a decrease of 4.5 yuan. A Jiji barrel of fresh oil is 26 million, and a Big Head is 16 yuan. Shengji cake opens at 9.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour has been falling all the way, because most sellers are eager to sell for silver, and the market is showing more supply than demand. Various brands of flour have plummeted by 3 yuan. The warship brand opens at 1.1 yuan in the morning with Yuan heads, then opens at 1.05 yuan midway, closes at 9.8 corners at noon, and finally moves down to 9 corners. Old Che also falls from 1.4 yuan to 1.15 yuan, but it is still difficult to sell. Bran is offered at 8.5 corners.</p>
<p>Soybeans are traded in both bank drafts and silver dollars. The street has slightly replenished. Affected by the soaring silver dollar, the market is virtually up and actually down. The park bean is 2.9 yuan, Pinghu Du bean is 4.5 yuan, white sesame is 5 yuan, and raw kernels are offered at 6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Rises Endlessly; Gold and Silver Exchange Trading is Doubled</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, silver dollars on the road became the darling of the day, and gold and US dollars were overshadowed. Due to the need for contingency measures everywhere, the demand was urgent. In addition, the Central Bank's 50,000 and 100,000 large notes were released in large quantities, and the money supply was loose and excessive. Wandering funds had no way out, and transactions were chaotic. There was demand but no supply, and the market showed a buying spree. Prices changed rapidly and fluctuated sharply.</p>
<p>In the morning, Big Heads were offered at 900,000 and 1 million, and rose to 1.1 million and 1.2 million near noon. In the afternoon, the buying momentum soared, and reached as high as 1.4 million and 1.5 million in the evening. Small Heads were offered at 1 million and 1.1 million, and Eagle Dragons were offered at 700,000 and 800,000. Bank draft transactions were quoted without any standards. Big Heads were initially traded at 1.3 million and 1.5 million, but in the afternoon, they actually hit the 2 million mark, rising to 2 million and 2.2 million, about doubling compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The gold and silver exchange trading in the Stock Exchange Building is doubled. Because some securities firms have low business volume, they have switched to trading gold for silver and silver for gold. The sound of clanging is filling the ears. Big Heads started at 33 and 36, all the way down to 29 and 32, and in the afternoon, they were as low as 28 and 31.</p>
<h3>Gold Quotations are Chaotic</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's gold market situation was still very chaotic, with little trading. In the morning, because the other party sold gold and bought silver, and the number of chips increased, bank draft transactions had more supply than demand. Quotations fell from 4,200 and 4,700 all the way down to 3,500 and 4,000. Near noon, because the money supply was loose, the banks helped with all their strength to absorb, and prices rose to 4,500 and 5,000.</p>
<p>US dollar transactions have no standards. The market quotations are only between 670,000. In the exchange method, a Big Head of 6 yuan exchanges for 10 US dollars, and there are also transactions. The final market quotation is 900,000 to buy and 1 million to sell, all settled with Japanese bank drafts.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the jewelry stores still did not resume price posting. Although the jewelry stores in this city are open as usual, the transaction is still stalled. The exchange of new and old is also sluggish, with a loss of 600,000 per tael.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Still Not Trading Actively</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market still did not see active trading, mainly because wholesale merchants in this area found direct sales to be quite sluggish, so their interest was minimal. As for buyers in South China, most are directly exchanging gold with factories.</p>
<p>Transactions in the cloth market are still not expanding significantly. Both industry insiders and customer groups are cautious. Only three transactions took place throughout the day, and high prices were on the rise.</p>
<p>"Dragon Head" fine cloth retreated from 3.95 million to 3.7 million, but recovered to 4.15 million at midday, ultimately rising by 1.05 million compared to the previous day. "Five Blessings" fine cloth was quoted actively from 2.8 million to 3 million, but no transactions were seen afterward. "Four Gentlemen" serge initially stood at the 4 million mark in the morning, suddenly plunged to 3.5 million midway, and finally rose to 4.2 million at the close, continuing to rise by 1.1 million. Trading was uniformly lackluster for all other fabrics.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stock Market Quiet</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Stock trading in Shanghai yesterday became increasingly sparse. Securities firms were exceptionally deserted. Floating capital in the market focused on gold and silver. Investor sentiment in the stock market was disheartened, and the trend was stagnant. Inside the market, only popular stocks saw a few closing transactions. Minor stocks had no price quotations at all, and the market trend was weak. Yung Shing Cotton Mill opened low at 250 yuan in the morning, and operators rushed to close positions, even down to 200 yuan. Off-market short covering occurred on small declines, rebounding to close at 255 yuan. Sin Kwong, because it stood firm against widespread weakness the day before, continued to be supported by backers yesterday. It opened in the morning and was immediately pushed up to 11.20 yuan, reaching the limit increase. Amidst the sharp fall of Yung Shing Cotton Mill and generally soft market conditions, it fell to 10 yuan, finally closing at 10.05 yuan, still a gain from the previous day's squeeze. King Fook, Wing Fung, and National Goods all closed at the limit increase. Mayar Silk Mill continued to soften, opening at 5.80 yuan in the morning and falling to close at 5 yuan. China Pottery opened initially at 4.30 yuan and held its original price at midday, while all others saw no trading.</p>
<p>In after-hours trading, the trend of Yung Shing Cotton Mill turned sharply, with bulls strongly supporting it, firmly closing at the limit increase of 297.50 yuan. Sin Kwong, King Fook, Wah Fung, National Goods, French Textile, etc., all followed suit, simultaneously reaching the limit increase. Mayar Silk Mill initially traded at 5.80 yuan, rising to 7.20 yuan, and finally closing at 6.90 yuan in the evening, up 90 cents. Taiwan Sugar 490,000 yuan, down 100,000 yuan, all others did not trade. Total volume traded was 127,700,000 shares.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency] In order to ensure local security and cope with emergencies, the municipal military and political authorities have decided to thoroughly evacuate the city's population, stipulating restrictions on the entry of people from other areas. Citizens of this city without national identification cards will be forcibly evacuated, and the issuance of national identification cards will be suspended from today. An announcement has been jointly issued by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the Municipal Government. This reporter recently visited Mr. Chang Hsiao-sung, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, who stated that the city's population is too concentrated, and supplies are a concern in the event of a crisis, so evacuation is necessary. However, since the announcement of this measure, military and government personnel and citizens in the city have been flocking to the bureau to request the issuance of cards, posing difficulties. In order to implement military measures, the bureau has ordered strict enforcement of the suspension of issuing national identification cards and the cessation of processing registration for those moving in from other areas, without any favoritism. Otherwise, severe punishment will be imposed. As this is an emergency measure, it is hoped that citizens will enthusiastically and voluntarily evacuate for safety, he said.</p>

<h3>Acceptance of Silver Dollars by Transportation Agencies is Only a Stopgap Measure</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Amidst the rapidly changing situation, transportation agencies in this city, such as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the ticket offices of China and Central Aviation Companies, have been extremely crowded in recent days. It is rumored that some passengers are dissatisfied with the sale of passenger tickets priced in silver dollars. However, it is understood that this method of various transportation agencies is originally a stopgap measure to facilitate passengers in the context of a shortage of cash, and has been reported to and approved by the Ministry of Communications. However, it is by no means a rejection of Gold Yuan notes. For example, the China Aviation Corporation ticket office on the Bund has posted a notice welcoming passengers to purchase air tickets with cash and promissory notes from national banks.</p>
<h3>Private Possession of Weapons, Plotting Wrongdoing - Two Locations Investigated, Four Criminals Executed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since this city entered a wartime state, residents from the suburbs have been moving into the urban area, and the Hongqiao area west of Shanghai is particularly crowded compared to other places. The Tushan Bay blockade requires identification checks, so waiting takes time, but it has decreased slightly in the past two days. A small number of shops in the towns of Caohejing, Hongqiao, Meilong, and Qibao are still open for business, but business is slow. Residents are busily constructing defensive works. The local area is as peaceful as usual. The Qibao Township Self-Defense Corps arrested two unidentified young men from northern Jiangsu in Xiaoduchuan the day before. A loaded pistol was found. Another person opened fire when resisting arrest and was killed on the spot. A total of two people were captured. After questioning by the garrison stationed in the town, they were bound to the main parade ground yesterday morning and executed by firing squad in accordance with martial law.</p>
