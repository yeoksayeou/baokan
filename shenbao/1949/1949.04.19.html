<h3>和談面臨攤牌階段　政府今日會商決定　共軍渡江要求將予堅拒</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕和談已臨攤牌階段，中共所提國內和平協定草案，已使政府感覺空前困擾。十八日竟日在李代總統及何閣揆與各要員之分頭接觸交換意見，至午夜以後始畢。意見大致已趨一致，並定十九日晨由何應欽邀請代總統，于右任·童冠賢·張羣·居正·白崇禧·朱家驊等，舉行重要會議，商討對中共之答覆的最後決定。並聞政府可能於十九日下午，發表聲明，說明態度。根據各要員於十八日竟日交換意見之結果，幾一致認爲八條廿四款，實爲投降之條件。官方某權威人士稱：何內閣是和平內閣，乃眞正謀求和平者，人民需要的是眞正的公平的和平，而非投降式的和平。該官方權威人士之談話中，包括有政府極難接受此種條件之可能性。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕政府對中共之要求，將於十九日舉行之重要會議中作最後决定，該會由何應欽召集。居正·吳鐵城·朱家驊，亦將於十九日晨目溪口返滬，換機飛京，趕來參加該項重要會議。十八日晚，官方人士對該項會議極爲重視，認爲係决定是江以南地區是否技降之命運之關鍵。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕中共在其八條廿四款中，要求共軍於和平協定簽字後，即由八個據點渡江，駐兵各大城市，監督改編軍隊問題，現已成和談之最困難問题。政府要員十七十八兩日來交換意見之結果，咸認爲無法接受，十九日何應欽召集之會議中，將就此事，再加研討。據靈通人士十八日晚透露，政府决定拒絕共軍渡江之要求。至以何種方式表示政府之拒絕態度，則將於十九日會中商討。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕黄紹　十八日會赴中央醫院就醫，檢查身體，渠返平期未定，聞將在十九日會中決定。</p>
<h3>中共所提廿四款　重要十項之內容　李代總統否認致電毛澤東</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕據有關方面透露，中共所提八條廿四款中，其最重要者爲：（一）戰爭罪犯問題，改爲確定內戰責任者；（二）憲法取消後，由將來普選之人民大會，制定新憲法；（三）現有之國民大會，立法院，監察院，均於聯合政府成立之日起解散；（四）軍隊改編，由聯合政府負責，國民黨所有陸軍，均留在原防，不得行動，聽候聯合政府改編爲國防軍；（五）國民黨海空軍，限期移交聯合政府；（六）人民解法軍須渡江監督國民黨軍隊之改編，其渡江地點，爲江陰，揚中，貴池，安慶，九江，荻港，銅陵，東流等八處；（七）長江以南地區，先實行减租减息，逐步達到土地改革目的；（八）由共產黨，國民黨，及各民主黨派，組成聯合政府；（九）聯合政府决策機構，爲聯合政府最高委員會；（十）自聯合政府成立之日起，所有有各級省縣政府，均應移交。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕此間晚報十八日載李代總統十八日晨致電毛澤東，對中共所提之和平協定簽字日期，請予延展一事，十八日晚政府發言人正式予以否認。據稱：李代總統十八日並未致電毛氏請求展期。</p>
<h3>吳鐵城返京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳鐵城十六日由京抵滬，翌晨即赴浙東轉赴牽化，晋謁蔣總載。行前並未晤及黄紹竑氏，中共所提出廿四款全文亦未獲悉。吳氏並已於十八日夜車自滬返京。</p>
<h3>第三方面人士　赴平行期未定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中共邀請第三方面赴平事，截至昨晚爲止，人數及行期均未確定。據羅隆基表示：此事僅於報端獲悉，政府迄尚未派員面洽，擬俟明瞭情况後，再加考慮；張瀾氏之意見，與渠相同。</p>
<h3>立院法制會否決　簡化考院組織案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕立院法制委會十八日最審查周傑人等提「擬諦修正考試院組織法，裁撤考選部，其業務由考試院直接辦理，並將銓叙部緊縮爲銓叙署，以資簡化，而節公帑案」。考選部長田炯錦列席報告，各委員相繼發言，認爲考銓合一爲不合理，考試院下設兩部，並不龐大，不應裁撤，多主張本案保留，經表決結果將原案否決。</p>

<h3>國民黨中央執委會　發表當前和談聲明　國家民族獨立自由不容改變</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十八日電〕國民黨中執委會十八日發表對當前和談聲明，全文如下</p>
<p>「本年元且蔣總統發表文告，願與中國共產黨重新商討停止戰爭，恢復和平，並揭示和平之具體辦法，只要和議無害於國家的獨立完整，而有助於人民的休養生息，只要神聖的憲法不由此而違反，民主憲不因此而破壞，中華民國的國體能够確保，中華民國的法統不致中斷，軍隊有確實的保障，人民能够維持其自由的生活與目前最低生活水準，則個人進退出處絕不縈懷，而一應國民的公意是從，其謀國之苦心，光明之態度，已引起全國之同聲響應。</p>
<p>至本年一月廿一日，蔣總統爲求達到弭戰銷兵起見，復毅然發表聲明，决定身先引退，依據憲法，以李副總統代行總統職權，期望全國軍民暨各級政府同心一德，翊贊李代總統，一致協力促成永久之和平，同時重述其主張在求拯救人民於水火，保國家之元氣，使領土主權克臻完整，歷史文化與社會秩序不受摧殘，人民生活與自由權利確有保障。</p>
<p>蒋總統爲本黨總裁，上述兩項文告，皆經獲得本黨中央一致同意，然後鄭重發表者。良以國父創造本黨之一貫宗旨，即在實現三民主義，以奠國基於永固，謀世界之和平，蔣總統此項主張，實足以代表本黨五十年來犧牲救國盡忠主義之傳統精神，故本黨同志無不一致努力，以爲此項主張之後盾。</p>
<p>憑國民與黨之公意　支持代總統何院長</p>
<p>李代總統代行總統職權以後，即本上述兩項文告之啟示，以忍辱負重之精神，積極從事於和談途徑之覓取，卒賴國民公意之督促，舉國與論之支援，始於本月一日獲致雙方代表在北平開始和談，至是，和平曙光始呈一綫，國內同胞與世界友邦咸一致屬目，以爲中國治亂，世界安危胥以此次和談之結果焉重要之關鍵。</p>
<p>在平和談進行中，其最可遺憾或足爲和談之障碍者，厥爲謠諑之陰霾，此種謠諑，大抵由於和談進行之艱困途畢中任和談之責者咸有審慎戒懼之心，不欲隨便揭露消息之故，本黨爲掃除和談障碍計，爲將本黨對和談之一貫主張再次聲明，以正中外之觀聽。</p>
<p>先欲使國人明瞭者，今日李代總統與何院長對國家所負之任務，實基於中華民國之憲法，而其對本黨所負之任務，則爲執行黨之決議，李代總統，何院長所憑以與共黨和談者，爲國民與本黨之公意，國民與本黨則本其對和談之主張，一致爲李代總統與何院長之後盾，故本黨中央常務委員會於本月七日曾有關於和談之決議，其原則有五：</p>
<p>誠意謀和五項原則　保持獨立自主精神</p>
<p>（一）爲表示謀和誠意，昭信國人，在和談進行開始時，雙方應即下令停戰，部隊各守原防。</p>
<p>共軍在和談進行期間，如實行渡江，即表示其無謀和誠意，政府應即召回代表，並宜告和談破裂之實任屬於共黨。</p>
<p>（二）爲保持國家獨立自主之精神，以踐履聯合國憲章所賦予之責任，對於向以促進國際合作。維護世界和平爲目的之外交政策，應予維持。</p>
<p>（三）爲切實維護人民之自由生活方式，應停止所有施用暴力之政策，對人民之自由權利及其生命財產，應依法予以保障。</p>
<p>（四）雙方軍隊應在平等條件之下，各就防區自行整編，其整編方案，必須有雙方互相尊重同時實行之保蹬。</p>
<p>（五）自政俯之組織形式其構成份子，以確能保證上列第二·三·四各項原則之實施爲條件。</p>
<p>本月十四日本黨中央常務委員會關於上述和談原則第五項，復爲補充之決議，其決議文爲在憲法未簽定程序修改前，雙方協議劃定管轄區域，各自從事和平建設，待憲法修改後，即依憲法組織政府。</p>
<p>本黨對當前和談之主張，端在於此，茲爲掃除社會迷惑起見，特予以發表。</p>
<p>本黨認爲·和談結果關係國家民族前途至鉅，任何政黨不能徒以其一黨之權益爲權衡，反之是者必將受全國人民之唾棄，本黨目國父創立以還，其永久信仰爲三民主義，其最終目的在謀國利民福與世界永久和平，五十餘年之奮鬥，萬苦千辛，不離此旨，本黨所求，只在能確保國家民族之生存與三民主義之實現，從無以一黨壟斷全國政權之念，惝國家民族與三民主義不能確保，則犧牲奮鬥，以履行其救國救民之天職，亦必萬死而無辭，此爲本黨對中華民國歷史無可逃避之責任，不如是則將爲國父之叛徒，先烈之罪人，此心光明，可質天下。今當本黨領導抗戰成功之後，國家元氣大傷，民生困苦，咸期蘇息，自當以和平方法努力促成三民主義之實行，本黨同志所爭，唯在國是之主張，絕不計較黨派或個人之權利，所願共黨人士應加諒察者，和談條件之細目，雙方代表自應各以極大忍耐，詳細擬訂，期其可行與必行，勿論如何，有不容草率者，若中華民國之名稱必不可變更，若憲法所賦予人民之基本自由權利，必不可剝奪，若國家主權之完整與獨立，必不可損害，使中華民族充他人之砲灰，若社會經濟之改革，必不可以暴力爲手段，使一息奄奄之社會重演清算之慘劇。凡此最低限度，犖犖大者訴之全國，人同此心，國是準　，即在乎此，倘逾此限，不唯無以對創造民國，掃除軍閥，抵抗日寇之成仁先烈，亦將陷吾四億五千萬同胞於永久不拔之深淵，豈獨本黨不當默爾而息，舉國同胞亦必有集正義之表示也，中國國民黨中央執行委員會」。</p>

<h3>是否投降的考驗</h3>
<p>中共對和談的態度，到前天已圖窮而匕見了。一言以蔽之，命令南京的國民政府無條件投降而已。</p>
<p>目前的問題只是：國民政府自李代總統以下，文武百官，願否俯甘聽命，電令其和平代表簽字於投降協定？說穿了，還正使國民政府面臨是否投降的考騐。</p>
<p>和平，没有一個人不渴望的：戰爭，也沒有一個人願意繼續或擴大的；但是，要使國民政府沒有得到人民的同意，率爾簽字於投降協定，迫着整個中國的四萬萬五千萬人民都關到鐵幕裏去做共黨的奴隸，做蘇聯的砲灰，人們是否願意和渴望着如此，却大成問題。無條件唱和者以及隔靴搔癢的美國朋友，以爲中國人心厭戰，似乎說得對了，却忽略了一點，就是：中國人心尤其厭惡受共黨的控制而替蘇聯作戰。與其爲圖目前的苟安而投降，将來被迫着去爲蘇聯作戰，我們相信中國人民寗願不要這種苟安的和平。</p>
<p>毛澤東氏代表中共，一月十二日就以戰勝者的姿態發表廣播，提出所謂八條件，即（一）懲戰犯，（二）廢憲法，（三）廢法統，（四）改編政府軍隊，（五）沒收官僚資本，（六）改革土地制度，（七）廢除賣國條約，（八）成立民主聯合政府。這原是對蔣總統元旦文告所提及的五項原則的反應。到了一月二十七日，李代總統在沒有經過行政院的決議，突然致電毛氏，說此八項條件，一政府方面已承認可以作爲基礎進行和談」由是而和談空氣，忽冷忽熱，中經幾多曲折，中共卒於本月十五日將所謂「協定修正案」八條廿四款」交付南京代表團」，並以本月二十日爲簽字限期，黄紹竑這位熱心和談的代表就不辭辛勞　飛回南京請示。同時，中共突然在北平廣播，宣告和談的經過，面所謂」南京代表團」與南京的國民政府却截至昨日下午六時止　尚不敢揭露此八條廿四款哀的美敦書的內容，深恐怕片面洩露開罪了中共。</p>
<p>可是中外記者從各方刺探之所得，中共條件之苛酷，令人雞以想像。例如（一）推翻憲法。（二）更改國名國旗，（三）廢除六法全書。（四）解散國民大會及立監兩院。（五）中央及地方各級政府概由聯合政府接收（國民黨的反共者當然無分），（六）聯合政府的最高決策委員會主席委員由中共遴選，（七）參照北平改編辦法，改編政府一切陸軍部隊，（八）共軍在江陰鎭江蕪湖安慶九江等處「和平渡江」，監督軍隊之改編，（九）海空軍應限期移交，（十）沒收四大家族財產而外，各地凡有活動資金一萬銀元以上者均分級按比例予以沒收，（十一）凡大地主中級地主之田地均應清算，（十二）凡中美間的條約協定均視爲賣國條約，概予應除，（十三）美國「在中國歷來侵有之權益應全部交還中國聯合政府」等等，都爲重要的條款。此外，更有（一）共軍須在京、滬，漢，杭，南昌，長沙，重慶，廣州，福州，昆明等十處駐軍，（二）蔣總統立即離國這兩條附款。一般人看了這些條款，都以爲中共氣燄之盛，如與當年中共宣傳受政府壓迫時政府在政協會議所持之態度相此，不可同日而語了。</p>
<p>我們以爲南京的國民政府，在誠意謀和的大前提下，所當考慮的，不應該是戰犯問題，也不當是蔣總統個人的居住問題，而應該著眼於人民將來所身受者如何，國家將来所處的境遇如何，　言之，即：人民是否有自由，國家是否能獨立？假使爲了接受這些條件而不惜犧牲上述兩項要件，那就是投降。這投降，雖或可苟安（？）於一時，終必把中國投入於鐵幕，而使中國人民在未來世界大戰中蒙受更大的戰禍。</p>
<p>無數先烈，無數同胞，經過革命與抗戰三十餘年所流的鲜血，凝結而成的「中華民國」與「青天白日满地紅」國旗，如今却要一筆勾消，日本人和汪逆精衛之流所尚不敢完全妄作者，而居然要做到它。這表示一方面充满「改朝換代」的封建思想，另一方面一定要亦步亦趨的跟着蘇聯。何况以中共人員爲主席而爲中共所操縱的聯合政府，勢必實踐他們本月三日所廣播的聲明，」團結全國人民……與中國的盟友蘇聯携手，打敗侵略者」，那麼，未來的中國，除了被中共牽住走入「鐮刀斧頭」的集團，使全國人民替蘇聯作砲灰而外，將無其他道路。請同胞們大家想想：在這樣的聯合政府之下，中國還能算是一個獨立的國家嗎？中國還能有「眞和平」嗎？無怪所有中美間的條約協定要律發除，而斷送外蒙旋大以及東北權益的中蘇條約却視同神聖不可侵犯，一字不提的了！</p>
<p>再說：新法未頒，而舊法全廢，民刑商法一齊丟人毛厕，使中國變成一個名實相符的「無法之國」，憲法更不必說。政權之原的國民大會和立法監察等治權機構一概解散，我們不知道由誰來解散？由李代總統麼？李代總統自己由國民大會選出來的，他有何權力來解散國民大會？他更有何權力來修改憲法？名不正，則言不順；李代總統除了自己革自已的命以外，沒有名分可以作這些事情的。一切法律都告廢止，人民的自由，天賦的人權，也自然全無保障。財產的清算與充公，自更不在話下。從前許多以民主自由相標榜的份子，假使在沒有法律的政府之下，怎麼樣還可以保障他們的自由呢？從東北華北蘇北皖北的共區裏「南奔」的同胞。知識份子也有，工商界也有，甚至苦腦的農民也有，他們都說在那裏，中共領袖「言出法隨」，（因爲沒有法律，所以他們的說話就是法律），已使人們全無「人生」趣味，大有「朝聞道（共產之道），夕死可矣」的氣概。「時日曷喪，予及汝偕亡」，正是共區人民今天有口說不出的心情。假使共軍渡了江，控制了全中國，不管他們的農村政策怎樣，城市政策怎樣，大概人民喪盡了自由，是一定的了。現在許多以學習扭秧歌爲時髦，以附和抨擊國民黨與國民政府爲「前進」的人們，到了那時沒有自由空氣可以呼吸，或亦不免有噬躋莫及之歎。</p>
<p>所以，今天的國是很簡單，一言可決，主持政府的人，果爲大政治家者，應該考慮到人民和國家之久遠的利害，而決定此一言。然則此「一言而決」　「一言是什麼呢？就是：在中共未肯撤回其八條二十四款的逾分要求而堅持必須渡江之時，政府與人民只有在「降」與「戰」二個空中去選擇其　，而無所謂「和」了。除非蒙天之福庇，中共改變其熊度，平心靜氛的重作商討，政府始可繼續其和談。今明兩天，政府確已面臨着是否投降的考騐了，而我們人民又將如何？</p>

<h3>「東方鐵幕」後之東北　吃飯有「階級」分小灶中灶大灶　居民不能出百里外無談話自由</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕瀋陽中央銀行分行副理胡育才，沈慕潛，發行科主任周振鎬等一行，自瀋陽易手後，陸續離去，周振鎬則於二月十一日離瀋赴平，途中歷時廿餘日。渠等於十四日由平抵青，與本報記者暢談，藉悉東方鐵幕後之東北近况一斑，其中關於經濟生活中之珍貴消息，足資各方參考者。其所談內容如下：</p>
<p>周君因離潘較運，備歷艱困。共方簽發通行路條，被俘國軍係發「解放證」，共方機構中稿生產人員，（即做生意）可持「生產路條」通行，均爲倒外，人民則絕無行動自由。共軍自去年十一月二日入城迄二月十一日爲止，其所簽路條，迄未超過離潛一百二十華里外。人民領得路條至車站須經共軍執法隊蓋章，方准購票。惟汽車司機可不携路條，局君乃設法獲得司機位置，於二月十一日駕駛一九三九福特卡車離瀋。據稱：瀋央分行改爲東北銀行分行後，央行人员限五日至十五日十日間報到，聲稱願留者以原職原薪待遇，不願留者亦須辦理移交，如無國民黨當局命令而自動有破壞行爲者，則須懲辦。其時共方接收工作之手忙脚亂，離以言語形容。故運用各種手腕留住舊人，哈爾濱銀行訓練班人員陸續到來，其文化水準極低，滿口名詞而不解其意義，笑話無窮。其中多數大約僅有小學程度，識漢字不多。當時兌收東北流通券，係三十萬對一，限一週兌完。其後諉稱軍管會尚未成立，願離職者，仍不能去。隨即開始强迫訓練，改變思想，每日六時三十分至七時半唱歌，八時吃飯，九時至十二時學習（或開小組會），一時至三時討論會，三時吃饭．嗣經一再提請實踐諾言，大部人員始於十二月十九日獲得「離行證」，方欲啟程南下，即被公安局扣留，欲獲得路條，幾如登天之難。</p>
<p>東北銀行一機構內伙食分爲三個階數（此「階級」之意義並非共黨理論中之階級，而爲共黨之薪式階級，亦即爲共黨所標榜之生活方式），其他機關亦然。計分小灶·中灶·大灶三等。小灶號稱保健饭，該行總經理曹菊如，副經理黄企之，以及科長等享有之，每桌四菜（三葷一素）一湯，有雞魚肉，吃大米飯，至爲豐盛，政府銀行界絕比不上。中灶則差得太多，該行股長及央行舊人副主任以上至副經理等用之，二菜（一葷一素，所謂葷菜，菜內約有肉最多二三兩）一湯，每桌六人，每日兩餐，一餐高梁，一餐大米。至於大灶，則兩餐俱爲高梁，每餐爲白菜豆腐湯，有時加上粉條，號稱「標準菜」，絕無變更。舊人副主任以下及普通同事用之，並無打牙祭等辦法。　共黨之待遇，其高級人員爲供給制，無須報銷。央行三輛小車，彼等使用極忙，消耗汽油較之央行時代超過甚多。如總經理曹菊如，家中有老媽子，但改稱爲「褓姆」據共黨所稱新式生活方式及理論，曹太太須爲人民服務，而由「褓姆」在其家中照顧其子女，似乎原則上每一小孩須「褓姆」一人，曹總經理家中既有子女四五人，故亦須有同樣數字之「褓姆」。事實上亦如此辦理。但此等辦法似未在共黨各種小冊子中有所規定。</p>
<p>彼等消耗汽油（過去政府存留者）似無限制，亦不珍惜，令人驚奇。本年初即開始發現蘇聯汽油，油質估計不足七十度，爆發力極弱，有惡臭及濃烟。美國汽油一加侖，該一九三九年福特軍可駛十二公里，周君使用之紅色（抗戰時後方見過）蘇聯油，則僅能駛行六公里，路面壞亦稍有關係，如在路面最惡劣情形下，有時僅走八華里。</p>
<p>東北銀行惟一業務爲公庫性質，並無會計章程，亦未有任何業務方針决定。東北在金融上完全封鎖做，獨立爲一集團，與人民銀行無業務聯繫，匯兌不通。東北銀行券流通至山海關爲止，人民券流通至秦皇島爲止，最初定人民券十元對東北券一萬元，其後山海關與秦皇島間之兌换率逐漸變動，人民券須打折扣，現已低至六折以下，即人民券十元僅可換東北券五千餘元，相對言之，即東北券較爲穩定。北平之生活費用適較瀋陽高一倍。東北銀行在瀋開設東祥金店，黄金雖自由買賣，但屬專賣性質，亦打手饰，黄金准許人民持有。美金對東北券並無顯著關係，某次美副領事胡寶德曾就此事接洽，當時曾臨畴決定以黄金爲準，每兩合卅五美元，然後折算東北券。</p>
<p>對於蘇聯方面之交易，據所獲直接消息，瀋陽之國際貿易公司在二月初成立，地址在火車南站對面，由中國純粹商人主持，而由蘇聯人支持，其惟一（—）出口物爲食糧（—），蘇聯商品爲粗工業品，包括色棉布及機器螺絲等零件兩大宗。又據哈爾濱來人所談極可靠消息，北滿方面之交易，則以糧食換取軍火（均爲蘇聯在東北之「戰利品」），間有機器。</p>
<p>以黄金，煤，高梁三種物資比較，十一月初，黄金每兩東北券四萬五千元，煤每噸六萬元，高粱每斤二千五百元，二月初黄金每兩十一萬元，煤於十二月即飛漲至十二萬元，此與季節有關，高粱於二月初每斤六千元，與黄金上漲率相等。大豆則完全無市，不見大豆影踪。北韓方面亦有商人到瀋換糧，携來多爲目南韓運入之美國打火機及其他輕便物資，可見蘇聯與北韓須有求於東北糧食。（下文轉入第四版）</p>
<h3>匪徒勒索不遂連肇事　穗新華影院被炸　觀眾三人喪命十餘受傷</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十八日電〕十七日晚十一時，此間新華戲院又繼金聲戲院後發生被炸慘案，該院是日放映「樂府春秋」，於二塲終結，觀眾紛紛離塲時，樓下突隆然一聲，發生爆炸當塲死三人，傷十餘人。據該院負責人稱：是日晨曾接匪徒勒索函，內署名「中國無產解放軍扶弱鋤奸大隊長張如龍」，並云請即窮給軍糧港幣五百元，限一週內到指定地點交款。另悉：是晨全市各戲院均接有同樣函件，各院隨即至警備部報案，而是晚新華乃遭匪徒先下毒手，警方現正嚴緝中。程潛致函陳渠珍　盼出山收拾湘西現局　保靖地方團隊克縣城</p>

<h3>柏林封鎖未全面解除前　四强談判不可能　國務院重申美所持立塲　傳蘇派遣特使赴華府消息尚待證實</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十八日廣播：成功湖訊，聯合國機構蘇聯常任代表馬立克今日否認外傅渠曾向美代表傑賽普建議和平解決柏林問題之說。記者詢以美國無綫電評論員皮爾遜所作上述消息之報道是否確實時，馬氏答稱，「皮爾遜常常杜造新聞。」記者詢以柏林傳來之和平消息極多，是否皆不可靠。馬反笑曰，「恕無意見發表。」記者又以外傅蘇聯曾派特使前往華府，商討整個柏林問題，是否果有其事？馬氏　肩不答。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十七日電〕國務院十七日拒絕評述無綫電時事評論員皮爾遜稱，蘇聯業已要求舉行四强對德問題的全面會議的消息。國務院新聞處長麥克德謨談稱，國務院的立塲已由國務卿艾契遜在上週聲明中說明，即美國始終準備聽取蘇聯在東西冷戰中的任何和平建議。按皮爾遜稱，蘇聯的建議係通過其聯合國代表提出，指出渠等願意討論解除柏林封鎖問题。德通貨問題。單獨的西德國以及四强撤退德境佔領軍等問題。艾契遜鹽於此項建議的重要性，已與英外相貝文及法外長許曼研討。據稱國務院對四强同時撤軍的一點，反應殊屬冷淡，蓋西方盟軍一且自西德撤退，則東德的數千訓練有素的武裝警察，對西德將爲一重威脅。同時艾契遜及其他美國外交人士早已一再聲明，在美國同意討論德國任何未來問題前，柏林封鎖必須先行解除。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕據此間保守當報紙今晨載稱，勸告克林姆宮對柏林採取封鎖政策之馬里寗，目前已首途赴華府，渠至華府時，將與參加蘇聯與美國務院有關解除柏林封鎖之談判。該報稱，馬里寗之府華府，係化名喬治葉夫將軍。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十八日電〕東德人民希望與西德恢復貿易，現正力促蘇聯解除柏林封鎖。據漢堡英軍主辦之「世界乙」報載稱，前蘇駐德大使狄卡諾索夫數日來在柏林勸說蘇軍當局接受其提出之恢復東西佔領區間貿易與交通方案，此事已臨决定性階段。狄氏在蘇聯對德佔領政策方面任務重大。</p>
<p>據美軍總督克萊之經濟顧問威爾遜宣稱，蘇佔區經委會已非正式通知法蘭克福德官員，請其共謀恢復東西德貿易事宜。但美方對於蘇佔區此種姿態，未以行動爲答覆，因在柏林封鎖未全面解除以前，尚談不到恢復貿易問题。</p>
<h3>美擬改變對日關係　頗有意在日推行類似西德協定　因盟國管制問題頗感棘手</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕此間美國官員今日表示，盟國在日佔領軍管制系統之複雜，將妨碍盟國間對日獲致一類似西德最近所締結之協定。又稱，過去數月中，美國務部及陸軍部，雖則主張在日亦進行類似運動，然此項協定之締結，必牽涉到包括十一國在內遠東委員會之解散以及取消一九四五年之莫斯科協定問題。</p>
<p>（技十一國遠東委員會即根據該協定而設立，該委員會有權決定對日一般佔領政策，同時又規定蘇聯在遠東委員會　有否決權，雖則美國對於某若干緊急問題，無須諮詢遠東委員會，有指令麥帥處理之權，然祇遠東委員會有權改變佔領日本法規或修改佔領機關之機）外交界人士認爲此項局勢，如美國欲如對德國然，政變對日之關係，以便打開未來隊日和約之門，有下列三種辦法：（一）美國獲致包括蘇聯在內遠東委員會之其他十國之同意；（二）美國避開遠東委員會，逐漸將對日關係達成無形之改變；（三）呼籲其他太平洋國家，採取不顧蘇聯反對之行動。准此間外交界又指出，雖則蘇聯遠東委員會代表潘友新，一再攻擊美國務部之對日佔領政策採取上述第二種方式，然迄今爲止，尚無何跡象足以證明美國現在準備將上述三項方式中美國現在準備將上述三項方式中任何一次方式見諸事實。</p>

<p>〔聯合社德克薩斯州茄爾維斯頓十八日電〕前第八空軍司令杜立德中將今夜談稱，今日唯一可以阻止蘇聯之物，厥爲美國擁有原子彈，及將炸彈運往任何地點之方法。蘇聯一旦擁有原子彈，則吾人必須有更佳之武器與更佳之運送方法。余以爲蘇聯已知製造原子彈之秘訣，但尚無製之工具與工廠而已。</p>

<p>〔合眾社巴黎十七日電〕各國代表國十七日紛紛抵滬巴黎，參加二十日在此揭幕的「世界和平大會」。同時，該會主持者猛烈抨擊法國政府，企圖破壞這一次和平盛會，蓋法國政府對尚須領取護照的各國代表，僅准核定每國八强，蘇聯及東歐國家原擬派遣二十人至七十七人的代表團，因此大受影響。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十七日電〕據法人方面今日透露，法政府將以入境護照發給至巴黎出席世界和平大會之蘇聯代表十二人，蘇聯代表團中有六人包括蘇聯著作家協會主席法古夫等早抵巴黎參加大會之組織工作，其餘六人定明日啟程前赴巴黎，其中有小說家愛倫堡，及正教教會代表尼古拉斯。</p>

<p>〔合衆社漢城十八日電〕南韓共和國總統李承晚十民日證實南韓政府正在商討及早撤退美國駐军的問題。李氏在招待記者會中稱：「韓國及美國代表正在討論關於决定美军撤退的日期問題」，但美軍撤退以後，美國軍事顧問團仍將繼續工作，「其任務在改進及擴充吾人的防衛力量。」</p>
<p>渠稱：美軍的撤退，並非顯示美國在韓義務及權益的减少，相反地，「美國將重行保證繼續其爲韓國的幸福與安全的經濟，軍事，技術及其他協助。」渠稱：美國訓練及装配的韓國軍隊，「現已很快地到達保衛韓國安全的標準，假定韓國不將遭遇外力的侵略。」同時，此間權威外籍人士認爲：南韓陸軍約及十萬人，已足够應付蘇聯支持的北韓人民軍隊的任何挑釁。</p>
<p>〔聯合社漢城十八日電〕朝鲜總統李承晚今日招待記者稱，朝鲜如無外來攻擊，其防軍力量即可迅速達到保障安全之一點。美國佔領軍已於去年十二月减少，朝鲜之同意撤兵，與現在請求美國接濟軍火物資一事有連帶關係。惟協助訓練朝鲜軍隊之美國軍事團與撤兵談判無關。</p>

<h3>沿西德捷克邊境一帶　美軍演習攻守戰　佈置宙達網偵察敵機來襲</h3>
<p>〔合眾社紐倫堡十八日電〕美軍七千八十八日向捷克邊境推進，作春季演習，對抗集結於東方之假想「侵略者」。「侵略者」係演習時對敵方之標準軍用稱呼。希特勒於上次大戰時，曾分兵三路攻入捷克，美坦克部隊兩旅此次即沿南路之南疾趨捷克邊境。第一步兵師緊隨坦克之後，擬抵住將於十九日自捷克進攻之「侵略者」。包括喷射式飛機之戰鬥機羣，奉命後自慕尼黑附近各永久基地起飛，迅速飛往已予棄置之前德方機塲。守衛嚴密之「活眼睛」，亦以雷達掃射東方，偵察來襲敵機。實際上，德境所有美駐軍均自自萊摩海文出動。軍部現求解答一項問題，即美國能否僅自德境美佔區完全供應戰塲上之美佔領軍。高級參謀官員嘗謂，西歐其他港口之共黨變亂，甚易阻斷最重要數日內之供應，更少在發生糾紛之時。</p>

<h3>南愛獨立奮鬥史　脫離英統治卒如願以償</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十八日電〕今晨零時零一分起，愛爾蘭已自行解脫了已有數百年歷史的與英國國王的聯繫，而宣布爲英共和聯邦以外的愛爾蘭共和國，使愛爾蘭與英國間長久的政治鬥爭，進入一新的階段。第一批踏入愛爾蘭土地的英國人，是在西暦一一六七年從南威爾斯侵入愛爾蘭的諾曼成爾斯的冒險家。</p>
<p>至中世紀末，英吉利的移民逐渐自趨團結，到了一六〇七年，烏爾斯特省密佈了英格蘭與蘇格蘭的移民，到今日仍保留多數的優勢。一八〇〇年統一法案，使愛爾蘭不再被視爲另一個王国，愛爾蘭在英國下院中取得了一百席，在上院中取得了卅四席，但不久以後，脫離英國統治的鬥爭立即展開。英國自由黨首相葛萊洽東在十九世紀末，兩次企圖提出給予愛爾閻以自治的法案，均未成功。一九二一年阿斯基斯首相再度嘗試亦告失敗。但烏爾斯特的人民意志堅决，並成立烏爾斯特志願軍實現他們的要求。第一次歐戰爆發，使這一各計劃暫時擱淺，但到了一九一六年，「愛爾蘭共和軍」遂宣布了愛爾開共和國的成立，但好景不長，在短短的一星期內英國用武力鎭壓了愛爾蘭人的崛起，十六名革命領袖被英軍事法庭執行槍诀，被放逐至國外的更達千人以上。在歐戰期內，下院內的愛爾蘭議員同意在大戰期內，暫不提出自治問題，但是南愛爾蘭出現了一位伐勒拉組織統一黨，展開艱苦的政治鬥爭，但至一九二一年愛爾蘭國民卒與英國簽訂條約，使愛爾蘭取得自治領的地位，伹愛爾蘭人的暴動並不因此告一段落。反對與支持此一條約的愛爾蘭人，互相鬥爭不已，到一九二四年纔告結束。一九二二年的憲法，規定設立一個參議院和眾議院。首任政府在柯斯格雷夫領導下成立。特凡勒拉起初爲了不願宣誓效忠英王，拒絕參加議會，但不久即同意加入。一九三一年伐氏以反對黨的身份，一躍而爲秉政黨的領袖，直保留到去年爲止。去年柯斯泰洛組織聯合政府，其第一件行動即爲解脱愛爾蘭與英共和聯邦的聯繫，至今日乃如願以償。但愛爾蘭人仍未放棄終止愛爾南北分裂的要求，他們認爲在北愛爾蘭未與南愛合併以前，愛爾蘭的獨立奮鬥尚未完成。</p>
<p>英國地位　並不削弱</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十八日電〕紐約各報均以顯著地位，刊載愛爾蘭共和國獨立之消息，並發表評論，各報大致均認愛爾蘭之獨立，並不削弱英國之地位，反之今後憑英愛間所將締結之條約，且可更有助於英國之戰略地位，蓋愛爾蘭在政治上實際上早已等於獨立，今正式脫離英共和邦後，反可消滅英愛間的猜忌而步向眞正合作之途。</p>
<p>各國領袖　紛電致賀</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林十七日電〕英王喬治六世頃致電愛爾蘭總統奥凱利，賀愛爾蘭共和國之成立。電內特別提出愛爾蘭人民二次大戰中協助盟國戰勝敵人之功績，並祝愛爾蘭共和國前途國運昌隆。杜魯門總統致奥凱利總統之賀電，謂渠代表美國人民及政府謹向愛爾蘭人民祝賀前途的幸福與繁榮。艾德禮首相·教宗庇護十二世·以及南非總理馬朗·紐西蘭總理弗萊塞·加拿大總理勞倫特·印度總理尼赫魯·義總統艾那第·緬總統蘇世泰·均有類似賀電致奥凱利總統。</p>

<h3>社局昨召有關團體會議　決定採週薪制　每週發表指數　今日提指數編製審議會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕生活指數計薪制度已引起職工方面之極度不滿，因近來物價瘋狂上漲，每日平均漲起二三成左右，而生活指數每半月發表一次，已有緩不救急之感。昨日下午三時社會局邀集市商會，總工會，工業會，工人福利會等有關團體會商此一問題，到陸京士，嚴諤聲，田和卿，潘士浩，洪念祖，周學湘，葉翔臯，范才　，沈鼎等，社局曹局長主席，會議中發生兩種對立意見，一派認爲生活指數已根本不能適應現在每日漲價之生活，主張應予廢止，另以銀圓或食米計薪。另一派則認爲生活指數計薪仍不失爲一合乎科學的方法，近來金圓貶值，物價飛漲，原因甚多，然其咎不在生活指數，可設法改善，而不應遽予廢止。因此會議中有三種意見：（一）改善每月兩次之生活指數計薪爲週薪制，即每星期發表一次生活指數，每星期發薪一次。（二）以袁頭銀圓折合金圓計薪，根據改革幣制時辦法，金圓二元，兌換銀圓一元，例如底薪一百元者，每月發袁頭銀圓五十元。（三）以食米計算，幣制改革時每石食米價金圓二十元，例如底薪一百元者，每月發食米五石，再按照當日市價折合金圓發薪。以上三種辦法經會中詳細討論後，大多數仍主張採用週薪制，決議辦法如下：（一）生活指數改善爲每週發表一次，（二）指數應於每星期三上午發表，（三）每星期四必須將上星期四至本星期三之七天薪金發清，至遲不得過兩天，逾期根據中央銀行公佈之日拆補償職工損失。（四）件工與日給工提前於星期二或星期三結賬，計算如發生困難時，則按照上週各該工人所得之底薪計算。以上決議案，社局將於今日市政府生活費指數編製審議會中，提出討論。又將於明日召開之勞資評斷委員會研究，資方對於每週發薪及不得逾每週指數發表後兩天發薪有無問題，俟均獲通過後，再呈送市政會議核准施行。</p>
<h3>工人生活受威脅　總工會今商對策</h3>
<p>物價連日空前暴漲，對工人生活威脅尤甚，昨據市總工會負責人告記者稱：該會爲全市八十萬工友之領導機構，對此嚴重問題，頗爲關切，今日下午四時在該會召開緊急常務理事會議，專事研討此項問題。除要求政府澈底嚴格管制物價外，幷將提請社會局對各廠工人工資應提早預發百分之五十，以免因物價之劇烈波動，而遭受貶值影響。</p>
<h3>新任財次楊綽庵　答覆財糧等問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕糧食緊急購儲會主任楊綽庵氏，頃由政府任命爲財部常次，已於昨日正式視事，經常駐滬辦公，記者昨特訪唔，就詢當前財政糧食各項問題，茲誌問答如下：</p>
<p>問：當前財部中心工作爲何？</p>
<p>答：目前物價激烈波動，影響民生甚鉅。如何穩定幣值，安定金融，要當爲財部中心工作所在。具體辦法正由政府積極策劃中，本人忝爲常次，一切惟秉承政府之決策進行。</p>
<p>問：最近糧源情形如何？</p>
<p>答：近半年來無日不在極端困難中籌劃糧源糧款。自糧儲會成立時起，對糧款即始終無固定預算，純恃臨時籌措；即使有固定預算，在物價不斷上漲之情況下，亦等於無。幸承各方盡力協助，對應撥各部糧源，卒能達成預定百分之六十之數，配合百分之四十美糧，完成供應民食三分之二之任務。在六月底以前，上海戶口糧定無問題，七月以後，現已開始籌劃中。</p>
<p>問：上海方面以麵粉交換華北煤斤，進行經過如何？</p>
<p>答：因上海缺煤，嚴重性遠在糧食之上，當初央行及市府均認有換煤之必要，故糧儲會即供給麵粉三十萬袋，又委託中信局代購加拿大小麥一萬五千噸，亦撥充換煤之用。本會對糧源之籌措，雖已煞費苦心，但爲顧全地方更迫切之需要，故不計一切，給予幫助。</p>
<p>問：有人控告先生前在東北物調會時購糧舞弊，此事真相如何</p>
<p>答：此事法院尚在偵查中，當初購糧，係奉命辦理，一切均經過東北行轅及糧食部之核定，糧款由央行直接匯交湖北湖南江西三省政府，由省政府指定機構承辦，購到之糧，則交中信局收運，銀錢物資本人均未經手，其中縱有毛病，亦與本人無干，好在法院對此事甚爲重視，當不難求得水落石出。</p>
<h3>日用品核本定價　社局獲初步決議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局昨邀集警備司令部·警察局·市商會·市工業會·中紡公司·台糖公司·烟煤調節處等機關，討論日用品核本定價問題，結果當無具體決定。在工業會方面，希望核本定價能顧到工廠之再生產，在市商會方面，希望核本定價能顧到商店之再進貨，經會商後作一初步決議，將提出今日市府召集之經濟會報中檢討。</p>

<h3>中信局標售物資　時局動盪少人問</h3>
<p>中央信託局近代政府物資出售委員會所標售之各種呢絨雜物等，竟乏人問津，每請標者僅有一二家，其標價又往往低於底價，因此常無法標出。據該局分析其原因，此皆爲在時局動盪聲中，商人因無確切之保障，致不願承購云。</p>
<h3>財局每週例會　改星期一舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市財政局每週局務會議，向例於每星期三舉行，自本週起，定爲每逢星期一舉行。首次星期一局務例會，於昨日上午十時在該局會議室召開，計到各科室主管等二十餘人，由代理局長錢健夫主持。又該局新任屠宰稅科長沈尚平，昨日起已正式到職辦公。</p>
<h3>自由論壇報晚刊　停刊解雇起糾紛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市自由論壇中文晚刊，突於本月十三日宣佈停刊改組以後，報社對編輯·採訪·校對·工役等全體職工，既未解聘解僱，亦未表示是否將繼續予以留用。該報編輯部職工，因社方以職工生活爲兒戲，曾於昨日向社方交涉。該社社長束全保僅謂：試用期間，可以無條件解僱。職工等遂推派代表赴市府晋謁陳秘書長，面陳該社社長於創辦時，曾告同人在三個月內經濟決無問題。陳秘書長深表同情，並即諭社會局鄭重處理。</p>

<p>俟二期易貨合同簽訂始克恢復</p>
<p>據郵局消息：目前南北通郵，僅賴易煤輪隻運輸，中信局與開灤煤礦所訂第一期粉煤易貨合同額滿後，在第二期合同未簽成前，北上輪隻將有若干時期之間斷，南北通郵亦將暫時停頓。唐山輪十六日到滬，運來郵件四百卅二袋，大生輪十七日到滬，運來郵件二百四十一袋，其中以小包裹居多。該兩輪係裝運第一期合同之最後一批開灤煤南下者。至利用航空運郵，亦因無定期班機，僅委託和平代表團人員專機帶運，故數量極少。本市郵局日前交央航五三一號專機帶運之航郵，至今尚未飛出。</p>

<h3>第一屆春季美術展　陳列作品感覺一新　成績優越青年畫家將由教局發給獎狀</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕昨天記者步行到復興公園後門南昌路法文協會，參觀了上海市美術館籌備處主辦的第一屆春季美術展覽會，其實過去上海曾舉辦過不少次的美展，此次標名爲第一屆，據說其展覽的性質，在採擇法國巴黎的春秋季「沙龍」的辦法，來獎掖青年作家和提高藝術的水準，出之於這種形式的美展，在上海還屬首創，因此引起了文化界密切的注意。</p>
<p>第一屆美展已於本月十五日揭幕，定期九天，至廿三日閉幕，裏面包括造型藝術之各個部門數量計四百餘件，作品中仍以國畫居多，這是必然的現象，基於民族傳統的性格，和國畫工具及材料的便利，作品自然容易產生，國畫優劣的區別，在乎畫家是否能在作品中表現出新的精神和新的面目來。這次展覽會中，有許多名畫家有新鮮的作品參加，如陳之佛·劉海粟·張書旅的花鳥，齊白石的人物，蕭　泉·吳湖帆的青綠山水，都能予參觀者感覺一新。然而也不能說題材改變即稱上乘，這裏有許多作品仍以舊體寫出無限新趣，如鄭午昌·唐雲·余紹宋·張中原·王个　·朱梅邨等工力情趣，均有勇往邁進之感，此外青年作家方秀桐，黃正倫等，亦可寄予遠大希望。</p>
<p>浮彫牙刻值得倡導　國畫以外，西畫，油畫，水彩參半，其中以參加青年作品競賽者居多，一般看來，都很刻實經心，畫面上都很講究，這是優點。一般的缺點，則是在習染西洋彩色印刷品的影響太甚，由於原作與印刷品的出入頗多，如果學者再加誇張，則弊　叢生，並失却自然美的要旨。這次展覽會中有顏文樑，方君璧，馬勛超的作品，其刻苦描寫自然所得的豐富經騐是值得觀摩參考的。</p>
<p>除畫品外，有滑田友，滕白也，劉開渠的圓彫浮彫，以及周憲初的牙刻，數量雖少，却甚爲精緻，值得倡導，望藝術家們打起精神努力創作，在下屆展覽會中，其成品數量，可以和繪畫媲美。</p>
<p>希望創造輝煌一頁　第一屆春季美展，經美術館籌備處主任施翀鵬等辛勤奔走，際此局勢及民情極度動盪時刻，終告揭幕，這是個奇蹟，他們的功勞是不能抹煞的。另一方面，它也足以反映我中華民性之滐愛藝術，藝術界是不因亂世而屈服的，相反地，多難之秋倒能產生嶄新傑品，這原是美術史上常現的事蹟。</p>
<p>保守成性，足以阻碍前進，美術界當然也不能例外，這次春季美展旨在發掘新進青年畫家，其陳列作品經嚴格批評後，認爲成績優越者，將由教育局發給獎狀，以資鼓勵，其意義甚爲深長，期望青年作家們能以此爲里程碑的起點，前進無疆，爲中國美術史創造更輝煌的一頁，第一屈春季美術展覽會是富有教育意味的，記者特爲鄭重介紹。</p>
<h3>通航船隻資格　船聯議決三點　原駛北洋綫應有北上優先權</h3>
<p>船聯會南北通航小組十八日下午舉行會議，商討北上船隻應具備之資格問題。出席沈琪，李雲良，鍾山道，董浩雲等，經議決三要點：（一）業務標準：各輪船公司之輪船，如一向行駛北洋綫者，則該輪應有北上通航之優先權。（二）性能標準：北上船隻之性能，應具備十五呎以內吃水及三百呎長船身，此種船隻具有優先參加通航權利。其次爲十八呎以外吃水及船身長三百呎以外船隻。（三）請求政府核准凡輪船公司已被批準參加通航之輪船，如遇年修等重大事故無法航行時，得調派其他合符標準之船隻代替行駛。而此項代替行駛之船隻，可毋須再呈經行政院批准，僅於該替航之船隻於啓椗前報請淞滬警備司令部及上海海關備案。</p>
<h3>被控嚇詐德醫案　巴登等宣告無罪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕德僑醫生史多勒，控訴前市警局外事警員巴登，葛萊西納及蘇籍地產商凡雪列夫串通恐嚇索一案，地院數度開審終結，昨日宣判因證據不足，三被告均宣告無罪。</p>
<h3>「東方鐵幕」後之東北</h3>
<p>（上接二版）二月初，共黨政府命令瀋陽南九條南八條居民全部遷離，據悉爲供蘇軍住用。中長路有蘇聯護路警，修理大凌河鐵橋爲蘇聯工程師，瀋陽蘇僑之急劇增多，俱爲渠等所目擊者。特別可注意者，爲大連之共黨政府與東北行政委員會（共黨東北最高行政機構）之關係。東北共黨之公營生產機構人員，持路條通行至普蘭店，擬入大連，爲蘇軍阻回，不准進入。某次周振鎬君隨兩朝鮮商人，擬經大連渡海南返，同在普蘭店被阻，韓人則准通過。由此可見東北行政委員會與大連共黨民主政府之關係與性質。據所得蘇軍印象，似較昔日在瀋陽長春所見者不同，彼等冷酷嚴厲，不爲手錶鋼筆或金錢所打動。大連顯然爲蘇聯式鐵幕範圍。</p>
<p>至於蘇軍在東北大舉拆運機器物資一事，東北銀行副經理黃企之之解釋爲：「設家中爲盜佔據，今有鄰人爲我逐之，而携去一筷一碗，我將取何種態度？」此種通俗解釋過份勉強，但除此外似無更佳之公開解釋。可證蘇聯並無將拆運機器交回東北可能。</p>
<p>共軍進入瀋陽一週，市長朱其文曾召集各國駐瀋領事談話，宣佈三項處理步驟：（一）沒收無綫電，（二）停供水電，（三）請離境。據周君目擊，二緯路英國領事館，二月初仍爲共軍包圍看守，斷絕交通，猶如封鎖鼠疫區。</p>
<p>瀋陽日用品如火柴，肥皂質地極劣，肥皂有紅褐色及黑色者。苛酸曹達，漂白粉，與工業用脂肪顯極缺乏。瀋陽所用火柴均出自安東，即爲共黨安東電台一向宣傳之安東火柴廠出品，火柴桿粗細不勻，頭上黑藥或多或少，每盒可用者不到一半。此可說明切火柴桿機器缺乏修配零件，同時缺乏精鍊之普通化學原料。</p>
<p>瀋陽居民倘無戶口，被稱爲「黑人」，有反革命謙疑，處境極爲危險。共黨始終認爲未能捕獲中統與軍統人員，據瀋陽二月間報載，某紅軍幹部（參加二萬五千里長征者）以得賄黃金二十兩釋放一中統人員，處以死刑。瀋未舉行大逮捕，惟居民簽領路條終不准出一百二十華里外，故等於全部拘禁，不若北平遷出遷入較可自由，北平未來情形若何，自不易推測。然就目前平津與瀋陽比較，人民生活自由，一在地底，一在雲霄。在瀋陽如留宿友人處，必須報告公安局，訪友亦不能長談，談話內容將被調查，亦不能耳語，否則共產黨人必睜大其懷疑之眼，露出神經質之爍光，加以詢問，惟黨人之竊竊私語不在此限，一若爲其可以驕傲之特權。住家食物情形亦爲調查對象，飲食較佳，則將被查問其經濟來源。保甲組織中之人身調查有三要點：（一）維持生活之經濟來源，（二）朋友來往及其談話內容，（三）何故未在民主政府系統內工作。捐款不曰「捐」，而曰「自動獻金」，共黨認爲「攤捐」係國民黨產物，共黨惟有「自動獻金」，而實際上仍爲「捐」，此即所謂「既要偷漢子，又要竪貞節牌坊」作風。</p>
<p>瀋陽商業凋零，商人有「賣光吃光」口號。稅捐極重，而購買力一厥不振。除糧食黃金價較穩定外，其他日用品無一不貴。如酒稅等稅票，限期一月，一月後不能售出，則再徴一次，以至無窮。此項辦法號稱酒類專賣，除遼寗省外，東北其他各處無之。遼寗省主席張學詩，軍政權力極大，最高機構東北行政委員會所未規定者，張學詩有其單行措施，渠正積極收攬張作霖舊部，但張作霖部老人無一應者，反勸張學詩不要幹。另一東北幹部呂正操則已解除軍職，任行政委會鐵道部長，似不得意。</p>
<p>前東北剿總各處長刻仍在瀋陽，周福成亦在瀋，張寶慈在哈爾濱，鄭洞國在哈確較自由，不與其他被俘軍官同等待遇，哈爾濱來人談，鄭常坐小汽車在街頭出現。</p>
<h3>政治犯一批　即日准保釋</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕本市地檢處奉命辦理保釋政治犯問題，前日經陳壽陶·王道周兩檢察官及地院鍾顯達·祝育璜兩庭工在上海監獄會同審查，並經該處昨晨集會商討結果，決定即日准予交保釋放之政治犯二十名，計合於政治犯釋放條例者有華德芳·陸自成·龔紹民·陳澤民·江海秋·何仲文·王中一·周雲龍·方聲虹·羅志中·唐新餘·龔柏德·虞成鑫·姚海根·王明遠·楊光明·蘇福康·張志明等十八人。非單純政治犯，合於普通保釋辦法者有周金龍·楊長敏等二人（以上二十人係經前特種刑庭，分別判處罪刑後羈押於上海監獄者）。另有羈押於該獄，函請淞滬警備司令部查明釋放者，計裘益慶·馮明良·應震中·徐震沅·顧三毛·王秋平·朱福生·沈鵬傑·俞勤學·許夔俊·王長明·張慶德等十二人。此外尚有張念恩·黃淦仁·俞得富·傅家均等四人，因犯危害國家緊急治罪條例兼犯殺人罪，暫不准保釋，俟呈請層峯決定後辦理。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕地檢處上週函請各有關方面，查明釋放在押政治犯，迄昨尚未獲反應，惟向該處申請保釋者，昨已達二十餘案，包括在押政治犯四十餘人。該處頃已向各該有關方面核復中。</p>

<h3>三輪車主黑心　以米計租　搗毀工會</h3>
<p>總工會息：營業三輪車主金志仙，於物價暴漲聲中，竟擬以米計算車租，規定每日白米六升，按當日市價繳納，承租車夫陳正桂·李森林·沈承富三人，以負擔過重，且不近情理，乃報請三輪車職業工會南區分會，要求調解，奈車主拒不到會，竟唆使不明身分之廿餘暴徒，將該會所中之寫字檯理監事照片及國父遺像等搗毀，現車夫三人已將車主金志仙扭送嵩山警察分局請求法辦中</p>
<h3>廣慈教養院　盼各界捐助</h3>
<p>廣慈教養院創終民國七年，院址在上海縣閔行鎮，有院基四十五畝，院舍一百六十餘間，培植之苦兒，卅年來已達一千二百餘名。八一三滬戰起，院中建築設備全部被燬，乃遷移至滬。勝利後得聯總援助，在原址興建簡樸院舍平屋十一間，即遷回繼續教養。因田租收入無多，捐款微少，現僅容留苦兒五十餘名，然以物價騰昂，支出浩鉅，即此數十名苦兒之教養，亦時有斷炊之虞，亟盼各界踴躍捐助，俾教養工作得以繼續。</p>
<h3>石覺將軍蒞滬　加緊軍事部署</h3>
<p>據悉，甫經當局發表負責淞滬地區軍事行動之石覺將軍，業已來滬，刻下積極計劃成立組織機構中，俾加緊完成統一淞滬地區軍事部署。前駐守平郊之石覺舊部十三軍官兵八千名，亦已奉令正由青島搭輪來滬，俾加強淞滬地區軍事力量云。</p>
<h3>南通等處退役軍官　可即登記請領退俸</h3>
<p>南通團管區，因任務終了，業經裁撤，所有南通東台鹽城退役軍官佐七十六員，目前異動情形，當局尚欠明瞭。按照規定，異動官佐，應受新寄籍團管區管理。茲悉：卅八年上期退役俸，尚在發放，上述各地退役官佐，如現有移居本市者，可至民政局辦理報到手續，幷向上海團管區及在鄉軍官會申請登記，以便請領退役俸。</p>
<h3>趕辦本年度征兵工作　魏司令等赴各區督催</h3>
<p>本年度征兵配額限期迫切，上海師管區爲如期辦理征撥起見，自今日起由魏司令汝霖親往上海團區，梅副司令展翼往松江區，染副司令國藩往吳縣團區，分別督催云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕上海師管區司令部官兵，於昨（十八）日上午九時舉行週會，由魏司令汝霖主持報告時事觀感，暨官兵生活概況，繼由甫有華北來滬之中國大學學生張君報告平津一帶情形。</p>
<h3>教唆門徒強刧殺人　楊在朝徒刑十二年</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕浦東順泰新米店股東兼經理張振明，股東兼職員陸浩生，頃以挪用公款，營私圖利等罪嫌，被提起公訴。按該店承售戶口配米，今年二月，竟將該月份第一聯配售證共九百廿二張，均未加蓋售訖日戳，經民調處專員於同月十二日前往查獲時，被告等諉係無暇加蓋日戳，惟查該店出售配米，並不擁擠，顯有舞弊罪嫌，經函送到處偵查起訴</p>

<p>十日晚九時許，自俄音樂師巴仟佐，（五十歲），住湛山三路八號，在市內工作完畢，回返住所，發現其妻（四十五歲）奧烏古斯志巴仟佐，在其私宅室內被人殺害，財務被劫。巴仟佐一對老夫婦，結婚多年，在該處已居住甚久，並無子女。巴仟佐當卽向市南分局派出所報告。警局獲悉後，劉局長國　，減分局長馬驤，刑警隊陳隊長鴻舉等立卽趕往現塲調查，至次長四時調查完畢。調查工作包括攝取照片，拓取指紋，觀察記錄現塲情形，登記失去財務，並調查附近鄰居。</p>
<p>雙手反縛　上身俯伏</p>
<p>該被殺俄婦雙手爲窗帘布反剪綑縛，頭頸部亦用窗帘布綑縛，頭部受鐵器擊傷九處，兩處係用手槍把擊傷，血肉模糊，上身俯伏於放置牆角之沙發床上，雙膝跪在床前，牆上亦遍濺血跡，厥狀極慘。被殺地點爲樓上右室。樓下臥室內櫥箱，俱被翻檢，衣服用品零亂不堪，普通人所認爲貴重之綉品用具，並未丟失，僅失美元六十元，狐皮反毛大衣一件（值美金五百元）香黃大衣一件，藏青西裝一套，包金飾物若干件，其中爲一洋金十字架，留下座盤，十字架則已撬去，共值約一千美金。又據鄰居一白俄婦稱：渠於七時許曾到入號，擬與被殺者談天，（兩人平時感情頗佳，每日互相探望）前往叩門，無人回答，自玻璃窗向內探望，見臥室門緊閉，乃悟日間曾聞死者言略感不適，此時或已入睡。八時許來探望，叩門時仍無人應，自玻璃望人，則見房門已開啓，頗感疑惑，初不料已被人殺害也。</p>
<p>現塲情況　三點判斷</p>
<p>根據現場諸種情況，劉國　局長沈默不語半小時後，卽作三點判斷，指示所屬，期限破案。</p>
<p>（一）本案爲謀財害命按，無政治作用，亦非仇殺及情殺。出事在五時至七時間。</p>
<p>（二）兇手爲外籍。（中國土匪多圖財不害命，且不致放棄普通認爲貴重之物品，十字架亦不致經過撬取手續）。綁縛方法爲外國式。其殺害情形至慘酷，爲俄國式。蘇僑及白俄中有生活艱困者，其他外籍人不致鋌而走險。當爲蘇僑或白俄人。</p>
<p>（三）兇手可能與死者熟識，故必須殺以滅口。兇手在一人以上。</p>
<p>偵查範圍　迅速縮小</p>
<p>於是立卽根據外僑登記表，將蘇僑及俄僑民中品行不端者八人開入黑名單，兇手巴埠諾夫及伊賽居然列第一第二名。據平日考查，此二人平時原爲著名無賴。四出偵查結果，就出事時間一端與黑名單中人一一對照，偵查範圍迅速縮小，認爲巴布諾夫及伊　兩人嫌疑最爲重大，開始分頭追緝。</p>
<p>巴布諾夫，（二十五歲），蘇籍，無正業，常樓身於中外暗娼處所，平時佳正陽關路三十四號女友家，出事當晚，換穿一身新衣服，佳榮城路卅九號女友家。習慣起床時間爲上午十一時，次日起床甚早，並整頓行裝，有離去模樣。伊賽，（十九歲）蘇籍，其父已向警局申明脫離父子關係，現在中興酒吧當夥友，佳南海路七號之四女友處，出事當晚起，卽未到酒吧工作。</p>
<p>兩犯擒獲　一鞫而服</p>
<p>十三號晨，市南分局刑警室巡官董作霖，警長李斌，刑警王京言，黃佳書，持巴·伊兩人照片往龍口路東方市場一帶分頭搜查，發現巴·伊兩人正幷肩自市塲外出，刑警黃佳書卽隻身上前將伊賽捕獲，巴布諾夫則被脫逃。經將伊賽帶局訊問，伊賽仍穿行兇時所穿草綠黃呢上衣，灰絨袴，上身有血跡斑點廿六處，已經揩刷，但仍顯露。初尚支吾，警局擬將衣上血漬化騐，伊旋卽吐露實情，表演行兇經過，警局認爲與現場調查結果相符，並供出巴布諾夫可能的去處。下午一時半，復在正陽關路三十四號將巴布諾夫擒獲。巴身穿劫來之藏青裝，並搜出一部贓物。伊賽之血跡袴在齊東路友人處搜出，上有血漬十五處，兇器鐵棍則在跑馬塲土內起出，贓證俱全。一鞫而服。</p>
<p>乏錢過節　起意行兇</p>
<p>據供行兇經過：去年春間，巴布諾夫在冠縣路都拉營酒吧與伊賽相識，以後常相過從。一週前兩人在榮城路撒那達拉區家相會，撒與其姘婦不在家，兩人談到四月廿四日復活節將屆，無錢過節，須動腦筋。三日後在蘇聯俱樂部相晤，巴說湛山三路八號在蓋新房子，該處係專在各酒吧當音樂師之巴仟佐所居，巴仟佐一定有錢，遂計劃搶刦。五日下午，伊借得手槍一支，子彈五十二顆，在聯合飯店附近交與巴布諾夫，次日在跑馬塲試發一槍，以察效用。幷決定在九日動手。九日巴獨自藏槍前往，見院內有中國人作工退回。</p>
<p>佯稱租屋　出槍威嚇</p>
<p>十日下午五時兩人　先在湛山海山浴塲相晤，巴懷槍先行，見室內人靜，卽唿哨一聲，呼伊上前，共同敲門，時已六時許。巴仟佐妻開門時，兩人諉稱欲租用房屋，巴妻不疑有他，歡迎入內，進入樓上右側屋時，巴布諾夫猶說願以每月十元美金租用此屋一月，言猶未已，卽出槍指住巴妻，禁嚇聲張，並聲言將錢拿出來，決不傷害，否則就打死你。巴妻大駭欲號，並說沒有錢。巴急用手緊掩其口，伊賽則扯下窗帘布縛巴妻雙手，並塞住嘴巴，　其頭部，巴先擬以窗帘布　重裹其頭部，然後伸槍入其口腔，將巴妻擊斃，以減少音量，終以不妥，乃決定以預藏兩頭尖鐵棍，由伊賽將其頭部猛擊致死。巴布諾夫下樓搶劫，伊賽則仍持槍將巴妻看守。</p>
<p>逃滬未成　凶案先破</p>
<p>據兇手云：行兇時，曾聞戶外叩門聲，兩人乃忽忽搶劫，由廚房向後門逃逸。初不料僅獲美金六十元，故極失望。巴布諾夫將大衣兩件，送往郵局寄滬，寄件人爲「正海關路三十四號布魯高夫」，收件人爲「上海法租界比　洛夫收」。（警局卽向郵局提出）兩人擬先逃往上海，再轉烟台。倘追緝工作延遲一日，兩兇手可能於十四日搭輸南下，完全破獲當較困難矣。全案將解送法院抑或警備司令部，目下尚在研究中。劉局長國　以市南分局長臧馬騏等員警迅速破案，效率卓著，已予獎勵。巴·伊兩人有在滬犯案嫌疑，警局已函滬警局協助調查。</p>

<h3>「皇墳」轟動宜興城　高塍鎮古墓初步發掘記</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　朱向高</p>
<p>〔本報宜興十七日訊〕屬於本縣和橋區高塍鎮第一保的名大橋地方，有一面積頗廣大的名塚，鄉人俗稱爲「鮑皇墳」，記者查遍了本邑縣誌，始終查不到有這樣的記載，然而那邊的鄉人最近卻說得疑神疑鬼，說什麽夜裏發現該墓上透出神光，墳裏蘊藏著奇珍異寶，傳說紛紜，人言言殊。</p>
<p>十三日早晨鄉農們荷着耕具，可是挖掘這座「皇墳」，經過一天的努力，僅挖掘發現了墳墓的石門及石檻，如今又從這座石門打了一個大窟窿，因爲裏面沒有陽光射入，漆黑一團，少見多怪的鄉農，便紛紛傳說裏面有偉大的巨廈建築，鐵　掛着兩口鐵棺，消息傳出以後，轟動遐邇，數十里外的居民，也紛紛前來探視，記者特偕同當地記者公會理事周疲月等，專程前往採訪。</p>
<p>專車直達天主堂，由當地嚮導偕同向西北面步行計兩華里，距數十丈遠，老早看到成千百的男女老幼團團圍住這個高約二丈餘，三個巨大的土墩，排列成品字形廣大的面積上植有不少墳墓，樹木，花草，顯得年代已很古老的樣子，記者先在墩外前後左右巡視一週，計費半小時，可見該墓範圍之大。</p>
<p>經過一年近九十之古稀老農探詢，據告，該鮑皇墳想係晉朝遺物，至俗諺所傳內間係埋葬鮑龍，鮑虎，鮑三娘三人之出典何在，則無從探索，早先本地本住有鮑姓後裔，惜現已絕跡，故無從查究，致該墳亦失人管理，逐漸荒廢迄今。</p>
<p>挖掘的地位，在靠南的一塚，費一天的功夫，刻已由地平綫掘下至兩人餘長度之深，墓穴深處，現出白石門兩扇，長約三尺五寸，闊一尺五寸，厚四寸，石門上下均有尺餘厚的石檻兩方，四週係用青色古磚所砌成，每塊較城磚大約計二倍有奇，重達三十餘市斤，因體積過於笨重，無從拾藏，該磚平整無缺，上面並無花紋，古文，故亦無從拓摸刊載，俾考古家研究，據該村一位學究告記者據渠推測係漢磚，然以記者推測，頗像是晉磚，因迄晉時方有義興羣之設置，堆積地面墓磚，現均由鄉民自由取運，鎮公所也不加干涉，實在他們不知道有多少價值，僅有幾個看熱鬧的讀書人在搖頭歎息，發掘正起勁的鄉民見了隨同保護記者的自衛隊士都以爲將有干涉，嚇得紛紛跑了，大約在一待我們走後，他們想又來挖掘了，故記者一再提醒高塍鎮長，假使再任其自然搬運，短期內很可能將頗有考古價值的各物，散失殆盡，亟須遣人責成保護尅日急行封閉，陳鎮長已經允諾，記者一行今日返城卽聞已由該地方人仕呈請政府保護，責成專門機構正式發掘，一待政府核准，卽可正式開掘，究爲何時遺留，何人之墳，內部蘊藏如何，是否有歷史上考古價值，也就大白了。</p>
<p>記者此行，承庸言報採訪主任周瘦月兄指示頗詳，倂此誌謝，</p>
<h3>常州田糧舞弊按要角　前縣長翁檉判刑</h3>
<p>〔本報武進十七日訊〕本邑前任縣長翁檉任內，着其親信盧品瑾充任田糧處秘書兼三科科長，擅權在握，營私舞弊，不一而足，嗣以勾結漕橋辦事處倉庫主任吳樹春及職員壽學範盛榮鄉等擅將賦穀運往無錫加工圖利。案發，盧品瑾壽學範等逮捕下獄，當時翁以縣長身份，諸多包庇，最後竟由渠保外，一一便利脫逃無蹤。地檢處一再票傳翁到案偵查，歷時一載於，終結翁檉確有主便嫌疑四點：</p>
<p>（一）盧品瑾壽學範均爲翁之死人，並與盧代瞇鋪保，致被脫逃。</p>
<p>（二）盧品瑾夠勁兒吳樹春擅將賦穀運往無錫加工，吞吃米四十餘石，案發後，僅將吳樹春撤職了事不加深究。</p>
<p>（三）糧食部派員調查所得盧·壽等以餘米折成稻二十五石及法弊三千萬元與翁朋分化用。並擅自塗改七關單，以粳易秈且派糧處職員盛榮鄉將壽學範移除解途中縱放脫逃。</p>
<p>（四）不講盧壽交案，足見上下其手，狼狽為奸。…乃向刑庭提起公訴。十五日上午由地院張院長票傳翁檉到案，並請陶檢察官一同公開審訊。</p>
<p>依據上列個點，當庭宣判處有期徒刑三年六月，　　公櫥五年，追繳二千〇五十七石二斗七升糙粳米與糙秈米之時　差價。翁檉當庭收押，發交看守所監禁。翁爲浙江人，歷任永嘉青田等縣縣長，此番落獄，實足爲貪官儆戒，而在逃之盧壽等，不知作何感想。</p>

<h3>限價難經社局放寬　米市場昨仍無做開　塲外白粳做高至一百十四萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食米價格，昨日社會局規定不許超過每石一百萬元，北市塲未做開，南市塲只次貨米成交五百石，每石均在一百萬元以下。昨日社局曹局長據米商報告，無錫產地米價昨日每石在一百四十六萬左右，今日米價可否卽依此價爲標準。曹局長指示今日米價最高不得超過　一百二十萬元。但聚據記者昨晚親向米店調查，門售每石已達一百五十萬元。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕食米社局放寬限價爲一百萬元，但市塲交易仍不能做開，因產地價高，成本高與限價，且周浦等地米價已到一百四十萬元，故貨主均觀望不作交易，市塲仍停市未開。</p>
<p>塲外交易，白粳做一百二十萬及一百四十萬，薄稻一百四十萬，早稻一百三十萬，後市轉疲，如銀根再聚，今日可望下跌。</p>
<p>食油　初漲後跌，終仍軋升。開市以米價上漲，人心仍極堅昂，生榮油最高至七百萬元，豆油最高八百五十萬，收市因銀根轉綮，價格疾退，生榮由退做六百二十萬，豆油七百八十萬，生油七百萬，軋漲五十萬及一百萬。豆餅交稀，長字餅三十五萬元。</p>
<p>麵粉　漲風仍烈，初市受大鈔發行及連日圈外激升影響，人心極昂，持貨者皆以物價一日數漲，深恐售出無法補進，而不願輕易脫售。初市一致暴跳三五成不等，中途聞央行大量拋出，銀根卽呈緊聚，收市拆息高昂，貨主迫切紛紛吐售，市勢遂告不支。老車一度破五十萬大關，臨收退守四十五萬，兵船以四十二萬五千，最後成交。</p>
<h3>大鈔供應外埠急需　市塲銀根劇緊　國行拋抽工作益積極</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行五萬元大鈔三種，昨雖公告開始發行，惟據該行某負責人語記者：目前該項大鈔，仍以供應外埠急需爲原則，短期內不致流通滬市。而昨日各市塲銀根，仍循上週末之緊勢，未見回鬆。一方面中央銀行之抛抽工作，反益見積極，黃金，棉紗，外匯轉移證，食糖等數管齊下，開出數量雖多，惟市塲因迫於銀根，無法儘量容納。</p>
<p>例如黃金前後請購者不過二〇八條，棉紗開出一二四五件，請購不夠二〇八件，故各項物價，雖聞大鈔發行而躍躍欲試，終爲銀根所囿，欲漲無力，僅呈盤檔之局而已。</p>
<p>又聞治安當局將於今日起，又將硬性管制各市塲之交易，例如限制其漲跌幅度，逾限卽暫行停止交易等等，斷然措置，卽將兼行並施。果爾，則兩週來如火如荼之哄抬狂漲，或可稍稍斂跡。</p>
<h3>金價繼漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市塲，因渡江傳說紛紜，人心忐忑不定，五萬大鈔出籠，環境利多，各方買氣仍濃。塲內因有限度約束，交易依然停頓，喊高至七二五萬八千漲停板，呈有行無市。塲外現貨交易，晨開高達九五〇萬，一〇五〇萬，因央行壓力未減，委託大德成兆豐昌金號，以九三〇萬，一路拋小至九〇〇萬。因頭寸緊俏，買戶稀少，共出僅一百餘條，更以港地有現貨流來，中途步回至八八〇萬，九一〇萬，終以九一〇萬，九四〇萬午收。午後因隔日交易，開盤一一五〇萬，一二〇〇萬，高至一二六〇萬，一二九〇萬。中途因央行續有大量拋售，以一二三〇萬，步壓低至一一八〇萬，再出五百餘條，人心轉定，曾降至一一三〇萬，一一六〇萬，以一一八〇萬，一二一〇萬收盤。除息三〇〇元，較上週末結果，再加六〇萬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日塲外期貨交易，晨開一〇五〇萬，一一五萬〇，高至一一二〇萬，一一七〇萬，低至一〇〇〇萬，一〇三〇萬，午收一〇一〇萬，一〇四〇萬。午後當日交易，開盤一〇〇〇萬，一〇三〇萬，高至一〇九〇萬，一一二〇萬，低至九八〇萬，一〇一〇萬，收盤一〇四〇萬，一〇六〇萬，隔日多空貼息，開二八〇元，三〇〇元，差金已一二八〇萬結價，較上週末反跌六〇萬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀樓飾金，變動二次，上午掛九〇〇萬，一〇〇〇萬。午後升至一〇〇〇萬，一一〇〇萬，較上週末再加三〇〇萬。飾銀亦漲二萬，升至九萬，十一萬。錢兌業烚赤，當日現鈔交易，上午掛九〇〇萬，九七〇萬，午後升至九二〇萬，九八〇萬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日美鈔塲外因廣幫套購活絡，進出尚旺，晨開二〇萬，二二萬，高至二一萬，二三萬，低至十九萬，二〇萬，午收一九萬五，二十萬〇五。午後隔日交易，開盤二三萬五，二四萬五，高至二五萬，二六萬，低至二三萬，二四萬，收盤二四萬，二五萬。較上週末無甚榮辱。</p>
<h3>軋空潛勢仍熊　華股後市激升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股市況，軋空局面，潛勢仍雄，大戶在上週極意進取後，銳勢之盛，出乎意外，如此表演，已使空方莫測高深。</p>
<p>昨日時局消息又見惡化，市間銀根緊勢環轉，利空因素居多，巨多爲避免反　，暗中已金蟬脫殼，前市拉高後，逐步出籠，臨收終回。後市因有遞延之便利，預料銀根緊後卽須回鬆，而局勢問題雖有波折，但事實不致如傳說之單純，故大戶仍多吸納，市況再起反激。</p>
<p>永紗晨開卽見一一〇元五角漲限登塲，各幫陸續了售，退至一〇一元，塲外更抑低至九七元。嗣後浮空其補，升至一〇六元五角收塲。</p>
<p>中小型股晨開受永紗之鼓動，初亦紛紛報停，信和·美亞·新光·景福·勤興·華豐百貨·國貨·榮　·統益·永公·麗安百貨·閘北·商務·中衣·振華·中火·上泥·台糖等十九種，均以漲限開盤，中間回疲，午收略振。</p>
<p>午後永紗初開一一〇元〇五角，仍以漲限開出，收市未動，申請了售交易先做一〇七元五角，一度低徊於一〇〇元邊，旋因逢低再抵，納胃驟旺，盤旋後重復升至一一〇元收市。其餘各股多種仍登限度，成交二八億八二五〇萬股。</p>
<h3>金債漲停　外股續俏</h3>
<p>黃金公債昨日銀根轉緊，華股先昂後回，趨勢步履相隨，中間忽高忽低，曾數度漲停。午收稍低，陳開三二〇萬，升至三四五萬六千登限，嗣後低至三四〇萬，午收仍至漲限。午後初以前市漲限價　買後，旋交易卽告沉寂，無甚做開，成交極少，軋升五七萬六千元。</p>
<p>外股走勢續堅，晨初因外匯證疾升，華股俏俐，人心習好，各幫扒吸仍股，臨收再見軋升。怡紗二三五〇〇〇元，二四五〇〇〇元，升五〇〇〇元。英聯二六萬，二八萬。怡　四六〇〇〇元，四八〇〇〇元。亞洲二六〇〇〇元，二八〇〇〇元，（上週六均無做開。）藥廣　九萬元買進，會德　　一〇〇萬買進，兩者均無賣出。</p>
<h3>黃金銀元比價　昨仍一對五十二</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行黃金對袁大頭銀元之比率，昨仍維持一兩對五十二元舊價。昨日請兌之黃金公約四千兩，掉出銀元約在廿萬元之譜。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日證交大樓，金銀交換比例，大頭初做四七·五〇，曾高至四八·五一。近午又低至四七·五〇。午後又降至四五·五〇。小頭五八，只出勿進，鷹龍洋無市。</p>
<h3>銀元套匯欠旺　馬路交易先堅後疲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元套匯未旺，匯水平定，難南華北方面，約有十萬套出，華西交易冷落，約有數萬元做開。</p>
<p>馬路交易先堅後疲，晨開因單幫傾力吸收，市況混亂，大頭曾出二十萬大關，高至二一萬，二三萬。中午因金價漲勢尚平，各方逢高有吐，低至十九萬，二一萬。午後因浮空有抵補，又高至二〇萬，二二萬，小頭喊十六萬，十八萬，鷹龍洋喊十二萬，十四萬。本票交易，大頭喊二二萬，二四萬，一致較上日再加四萬至五萬。</p>
<h3>棉紗漲勢稍戢　布市低價收束</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗漲風已告緩和，因銀根緊勢未已，人心頗爲顧慮，本街染指均稀，結果雖漲成餘，若加上拆息，仍不夠成本</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳晨開六六〇〇萬，一度猛叩七〇〇〇萬大關，午收鬆落至六三〇〇萬，較上週高六〇〇萬。三二支銀月由四七〇〇萬一路喊低至四四〇〇萬收市，終挺六〇〇萬。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨初爲三三〇〇萬，最高達三六〇〇萬，最後做三四〇〇萬，軋升四五〇萬。二〇支雙馬竄出大關，以三〇五〇萬收市，較週末高四〇〇萬。他若金城天女等，俱在三〇〇〇萬左右做開。一六支光明亦叩近三〇〇〇萬，一〇支童子軍二四〇〇萬，餘紗交易清閒，各方咸抱觀望態度。</p>
<p>棉布走勢恍惚，晨初人心依然望高，各方搜購續見踴躍，新高價層出不窮。迨九時半後，聞黃金開盤漲度尚不夠拆息，且銀根仍屬緊俏，市拆在二十元至三十元之間，於是人心轉虛，散戶伸手喊賣，價由高度鬆落，午收大致與週末塲外喊價軋平。</p>
<p>龍頭細布自一百二十三萬步挺至一百二十六萬爲最高，近午曾瀉至一百〇五萬，午收爲一百〇八晚，較週六午收價仍漲十八萬</p>
<p>四君子嘩譏初以一百二十萬開出，最高做一百二十一萬五千，收前曾低見一百〇二萬，終爲一百〇四萬，亦挺十七萬。後市人心又思活動，各布拉高三成，初開龍頭細布一百三十八萬，四君子嘩嘰一百三十六萬，交易不多，今日恐難站定。</p>

<h3>絲綢先高後回</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市況先高後軟，一二〇號有光新貨陳開卽期三一六〇萬高盤，卽哄至三二〇〇萬，旋聞外匯證盤挫，銀根走勢步緊，塲外囤戶紛起了結，低至三一二〇萬，最後以三一六〇萬收市，隔日交割初做三七五〇萬，旋步小至三六五〇萬收市。</p>
<p>午後圈外黃金帶息續升，喊價續揚，初喊三八〇〇萬賣出，嗣卽回小至三七五〇萬收市。</p>
<p>生絲晨開78勻度白廠絲卽期四八〇〇萬，旋升至五二〇〇萬，嗣因外匯證疾升猛退，市況帶軟，午收四八五〇萬，隔日期貨初做六一〇〇萬，終以五九〇〇萬午收。</p>
<p>綢緞昨因銀根轉緊，人心轉平，初因收市報振，買氣尚濃，嗣後華股突回，人心閒散，市見回平。美亞晨開二五六〇萬，旋升至二六二〇萬，　面逢高又吐，客銷不動，人心轉爲觀望，喊價步軟低挫至二三三〇萬，臨收本街幫略有添辦，市勢稍升午收二四〇五萬。</p>
<h3>國庫保值存款　日內即可舉辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部爲吸收民間購買力而擬之國庫保值存款辦法，全部原則業經立院通過，昨由劉財長攜返滬，將先由國家行局庫負責人，於今晨集會商討辦理細則後，最遲可望於本月廿日以前舉辦。</p>
<p>茲先擇誌國庫保值存款之大致辦法如次：</p>

<p>（二）利息，俟會中作最後之決定將依存款時間之久暫而定。</p>
<p>（三）期限，最短十天，此外復分廿天·卅天·三個月·六個月·一年等種。</p>

<p>（七）本辦者，先由各國家行局庫舉辦，各國家行局庫，亦將轉行委託各公私行莊信託公司等舉辦。</p>
<h3>市塲散步</h3>
<p>— 看合客</p>
<p>昨市央行未動　走勢今將恍惚</p>
<p>昨天市面，大家深抱戒心，所以上午軟弱無力。</p>
<p>央行非炙手不落的，於是人心轉變，下午就來收復失地，漲回利息，又漲了轉頭。只要天天這種走勢，央行的「偷鷄」就也難了。</p>
<p>發薪期已過，大頭落寞了。刮血朋友早已滿載而去，轉移陣池了。留下來的是，薪資階級，每敲掉一隻大洋，就在無形中被挨去幾滴血汗。</p>
<p>這就是資本主義的世界！</p>
<p>要問良心，須到另一個世界去尋的。</p>
<p>今天似乎是大局的轉捩關頭，市塲動態，勢必恍惚，捉摸不定的。</p>
<p>機鍵的，要寫定地冷看風雲氣色。</p>
<p>善　的，這真是一個最有味兒的日子。</p>
<p>一般物價，還在瘋。</p>
<p>是利息成本的原因，也是股票漲停板的錯覺。</p>
<p>其實，股票的漲停板，照限度算算，也不過漲個利息。</p>
<p>高利息政策，就有這個好處。</p>
<p>股市裏的做手，已開始新活動。</p>
<p>當然，大局的估計，以及今後的　牌，新活動或有修正可能。</p>
<p>然而，不修正的可能性，照現在說，和修正的可能性，是相等的。</p>
<p>「拋」的政策，似乎已成眾矢之的。</p>
<p>有貝祖詒前車之鑒，劉攻芸氏的勇氣，已堪欽佩了。</p>
<p>一個多月前，破有人對貝祖詒施策，表示好感。</p>
<p>但抄襲了貝氏作風的劉攻芸氏，玩了一個來月，又被「清算」。似是矛盾，其實在意料之中。</p>
<p>道社會，只可讓人賺暴利，替人擔哄動物價的罪名，卻決不可妨礙別人的暴利，想去的控制物價的力量。</p>
<p>港方自公佈禁金令到現在，華人對港當局的攻勢，在正積極展開。</p>
<p>照港地黃金每兩市價三二〇港元，及理論官價二〇〇港元，相差極鉅，有錢人惟怕收買定價得太低吃虧，所以現正採取兩大戰略，威脅着港方。</p>
<p>（一）在廣州宣傳港金大量走私運穗，破壞港關緝私效率的信用，讓港當局決定收買價時，可以從高定價。</p>
<p>（二）在廣州大量拋售港鈔，　低港幣價，以威脅港幣信用，造成港幣事實上的貶值狀態。</p>

<h3>甲二組D部重賽　汕隊三分勝紅騎</h3>
<p>籃聯甲二D部汕隊對紅騎之重賽，昨日下午七時在體育館舉行，賽前另有插曲籃委會對正泰，因不售門票，觀眾數百，呌聲不絕，情況相當熱鬧。籃會對正泰六時登塲，由張覺非吳成章執法，陳庸庵首破籃圈，正泰立刻還敬，繼成各四各八平等，未幾籃會謝益欽趕到，惟上半時仍以十七對十九落後一球。換邊後，旭滄先中，各十九平等，籃委會瞬以廿五對十九後來居上，正泰力追，卒難超越，迨時間終了，籃委會以卅七對卅二小克正泰。</p>
<p>繼之汕隊與紅騎重賽，黃村瑞劉荷生任裁判，中圈跳開，红骑舒家義犯規，羅少瓊罰開記錄，鄭桂濤雙中，五比零前導。紅騎家義初中，汕隊少瓊又罰得，濬哲少瓊一來一往，成八比四，家義再中，汕隊桂濤國藩雙管齊下，十二比六。紅騎沉著應戰，扳回四分，嗣又以十六比十五首度超出。汕隊急停，以陳明義鄭傳聲入替周斌鄭国藩，然而無效。紅騎　其文奚王龍罰擲相繼，成十九比十五。汕隊不甘，傳聲少瓊照樣回敬，迨桂濤得點，十九平手，其文少瓊罰擲互中，紅騎差一分，未幾濬哲破籃，前半績束，廿二比廿一，紅騎半球領先。</p>
<p>易藍再戰，汕隊以周斌鄭國藩代鄭桂濤鄭傳聲，紅騎亦以丁國梁換顧濬哲，明義國藩雙中，汕隊又抬頭。其文罰中，明義清江又爲汕隊加三分，廿八比廿三。嗣以拉鋸演出，卅五比廿九時，紅騎暫停，王介平易出丁國梁，汕隊勢盛，清江國藩連中，四三比卅一，相差達六球。紅騎入後　停力追，家義介平等獲球不少，惟失分已多，終難追及，卒以四二比四五，三分之差敗與汕隊。</p>

<h3>香港埠際足球隊　勝馬尼刺五比一</h3>
<p>〔合衆社馬尼轉十七日電〕香港足球會埠際　　遠征馬尼刺，昨夜在里柴爾紀念塲以五比一擊敗馬尼刺隊，觀眾一萬四千人。開賽後二十分鐘香港隊中鋒朱永強在離門五碼處一蹴中的，首開記錄。五分鐘後，香港隊鄒文治射門，球中門木，落於馬尼刺球員肩頭，彈入球網，上半時香港淨贏三球。下半時馬尼刺隊柴雜爾進一球，殊屬輕易，旋朱永強又中的，其後香港隊陣前無險境。</p>
<p>上半時開賽後二十五分鐘馬尼刺隊守門　瑪斯跌傷，規則規定不能另以守門替換，致馬尼刺隊大受影響。</p>
<h3>恩卡斯滬警兩種子隊　今晚分戰海豚與東華</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市長盃籃球賽第三組兩種子隊恩卡斯與滬警，今夕將分別出戰海豚及東華。兩優勝隊將於下週會師，爭後部循環決賽勸。市體育館門票，仍分樓上五千元，樓下一萬，塲內對號二萬三種。秩序如下：</p>
<p>恩卡斯－海豚　下午六時</p>
<p>滬警－東華　下午七時</p>
<p>恩卡斯諸番將，多係旅滬多年之地頭蛇，對各華隊戰略實力，類多稔系。再加體質上之先天條件，實力之強，可以威脅任何球隊。此次聯賽，更羅致美風象主將泊透，野心勃勃。雖以種種原因，聯賽未能問鼎，但第一週中亦有力克亞軍仁餘，最後一塲苦逼盟主華聯之精彩演出。者番加入市長盃，更力邀巨人台柱陶勃林基助陣，頗有失之東隅，收之桑榆之意。海豚爲甲二組中之佼佼者，陶英式·黃天烈·呂妙盛·侯勇康　，年富力強，最近又力挫甲二組D部冠軍汕隊，正在巔峰狀態中。今夕對堅甲利兵，雄心萬丈恩卡斯，雖難期勝利，亦必可予番兵以相當威脅。</p>
<p>滬警對東華之役，後者以足球健將姿態在籃球房內客串，雖然半路出家，但作風殺辣，驍勇過人。更佐以周達雲·陳祥龍·蔡演雄諸老將，智勇雙全。但滬警爲甲一組上雄之一，實力堅強，快攻術尤銳不可當，最近更集宿苦練。相形之下，滬警勝　，自較濃厚。</p>
<h3>大公籃球明戰麥令</h3>
<p>上屆市長盃冠軍大公籃球隊遠征南洋歸來後，尚未正式漏驗，茲悉將於明晚在體育館首次公開表演，對手將爲麥令斯隊，預料屆時黨有一番盛況。</p>
<h3>震撼香港　一塲好球　南南淨勝兩球　巴士飲恨離塲</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕「清明時節雨紛紛，路上行人欲斷魂；」這句古詩，好像是爲連日來的天氣，和昨天輸了給南南的巴士捧塲者來一個尖銳的寫照！</p>
<p>同樣，爲應付這一塲關係亞軍前途的重要賽事而調整陣容，並且戰來始終努力，在過程中更有幾個可勝未勝的不幸塲面鍛羽終塲的巴士英雄們，也難免抱恨難平；更難堪的是那些在雨中擠迫着輸購票，受盡「騖伯」們的推拉攔阻，終仍額滿見遺的數千球迷，猜大嘆不值！</p>
<p>這塲震撼球國的「南巴」大戰，勝敗的雙方，都總算不負萬衆迷民的熱望；南南的淨勝二球，固然不是倖致的戰國，而巴士的敗，雖然影響了未來的命運，但已盡了最大的努力，並且賽來的水準也不下於對方，在精神上是堪以自慰的。</p>
<p>許多「批評家」都認爲：在雨中賽球，巴士的經驗不如南南，　馬的衝刺都無用武之地！卽是說，巴士的敗，都包括在這句話裏。其實這種論見，祗適用在平時，以昨賽鄧宜傑與李春發的智勇兼施，衝傳俱妙的演出而論，足以證明這是「人云亦云」的「八股」看法。</p>
<p>事實上，雙方都是百戰雄師，在經驗看巴士並不弱於南南，他們在是役都能洞察在雨中塲滑球重的情勢下，不能多用高遠的傳遞，和長距離的急衝戰法，這因爲南南的守將，是剛柔合一的防綫，單憑勇猛的快衝，而不作機巧的滲入，是無法突破的。巴士前鋒昨天就有如此的「知彼知己」的頭腦，除了仍一貫地保持文治在後供傳作中心的指揮外，宜杰，春發，也有巧妙靈敏的盤運工夫，在適當的時候，又不放棄勇衝求利的機會，是頗堪讚美的；卽大輝與石金亦能配合這種戰法，而造成巴士整個前鋒綫的活躍進展。他們所以無法取利，是奈何余耀德的屢救險球，和幾番射門中楣的惡劣命運。</p>
<p>人們的批評，又將巴士的喪失二球，歸咎在譚均幹的不善撲救地球；其實巴士昨天不是老譚把關，表演「渾身解數」則南華不祗小勝二隻遍龍。因爲巴士昨天所失的，都不是地球，而是近門咫尺，急如迅雷的「中路波」，我們看了南南的三員內鋒的刁讚不羈，可見其贏得並非倖運。卽費春華也打得不「廢」，祗何應芬稍欠活力，這或爲「黑仔」不慣左位的原因，似有可恕之處。</p>
<p>總之這塲「好波」雙方的攻守是平均的，而雙方都能把握時間，沒有放過絲毫的分秒機會。巴士的敗，南南前鋒的取勝是因素，而其守衝的保持不敗，尤爲巴士前鋒不能得利的原故。是役雙方陣容如下：（十五郎）</p>
<p>南華南</p>
<p>張樹陵　劉松生　何應芬　朱永強</p>
<p>余耀德　謝錦洪　張金海　馮景祥</p>
<p>侯蓉生　謝錦河　費春華</p>
<p>巴士隊</p>
<p>譚振輝　馮坤勝　卓石金　鄒文志</p>
<p>譚均幹　孔慶煜　鄧宜杰　李春發</p>
<p>麥林福　鄧森　李大輝</p>
<p>在「球證王」奧馬鳴笛召戰下，皮球在鄧宜杰腳下發動攻勢，但不久便被南南取到優勢，這邊「二叔」兩番遠射，都越楣落野，朱仔也曾施百步穿楊，和「黑仔」，金海的兩次頭頂，都被均幹或接或托，一一解圍。然而久攻之下，何應芬兩次迫得角球，後一次，二叔截得撥交永強，朱仔毫不躊躇，就舉足猛射，均幹以突來冷箭，無法接救，於是南南在捧塲者燃燒爆竹聲裏，而奠定勝基。</p>
<p>下半塲繼續交鋒，初期南南仍極得勢，一次劉松生在巴士進取外得自由球之利，認門猛射，鄒志文奮不顧身，迎球頭頂，雖然脫救危局，但自己卻倒地暈去，要出塲調治了。南南更乘這機會，重重圍攻，松生在其心腹地帶得球傳交朱仔，永強一個箭步，竄進迎射，勢如流星，爲南南再建奇功，（二比〇）</p>
<p>未幾，文治卽勉強復出，而發動猛銳攻勢，尤以李大輝之幾度傳中，石金的幾番及時頂射，都被位置恰好的「靚德」救脫，嗣後仍聲勢洶湧，卻仍無法打破光蛋，七十分鐘的大戰，巴士終以二球之負，而飲恨離塲。</p>

<h3>乙組乒乓聯賽　今日六塲角逐</h3>
<p>前晚育才小將壓倒農機</p>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽，開賽以來已屆一週，各塲結果以收到先後依次宣佈，主辦當局頃審查首週秩序表內有十四日之乙三部冠生對農機之紀錄單迄今未見送會，該塲是否舉行，抑或雙方同意改期，並未呈報，不遵　則辦理，精神不佳，茲限於兩日內將詳情通知會方，逾期作雙方棄權論。今晚（十九日）七時起在精總綢業善保鄧五處球室續有乙組秩序六塲角逐，乙二部勁旅招商日前首戰聯青以五對零大捷，不愧具種子資格，此次二度出馬相逢滬警，後者雖係體育家馬慶之所領導，惟全隊沙塲經騐不如招商，預料凶多吉少。次幕聯合對抗公交，前者曾獲保險盃亞軍，上週初峰新軍鐵馬，因老將失建章缺席，實力削弱不少，僅以三隊二小勝，公交有健將盛日昇參戰，聯合如不以全師臨陣，恐遭遇對方威脅。其他四組中以乙三部農機對經緯之役將有劇戰，經緯均係初出茅廬之小將，體格靈活，肯拼肯跑，農機如以等閒視之，必遭毒手無疑。茲探錄各晚各塲秩序及前日結果如下：</p>
<p>今日秩序</p>
<p>招商—滬警（乙二）七時正精總</p>
<p>聯合—公交（乙二）八時半精總</p>

<p>信誼勝公交（乙二）三－二</p>
<p>經緯勝郵三（乙三）五－〇</p>
<h3>乒乓勁旅華聯隊　參加甲組賽奪標</h3>
<p>華聯乒乓隊曾參加首二兩屆甲組乒乓聯賽，名列前茅，稱海上五強之一，上屆分兵兩路，以華南與南華之隊名加入逐鹿，以致影響實力，成績未見優越，但華南仍賴老將張志鴻鄧秀榮李震等之努力，奪獲第五名位，本屆仍以華聯報名，並於昨晚七時在羅浮路德康里召開團體隊員會議，職員名單如下：</p>
<p>梁錦堂（顧問），陳霖生（指導），黃慶棠（領隊），張志鴻（隊長），李子蘋（文書），楊志雄（幹事），鄧秀榮，李震，盧文良，鐘支　，潘日熙，鄭家昆。</p>
<h3>乒乓須知</h3>
<p>— 王心景著　陳霖生校</p>
<p>限是心的代表，在熟練的乒乓家，不注意看球，而把眼目測著對方的　面，據頂自己還擊的方向，所以熟練地乒乓家，很多觀察對方的眼，判斷對方還球的方向的。不過這種決定，也往往容易上當的。有些人把眼光注視著某方向，但把球向反對方向打去，這種打法跟容易使對方迷惑，無法應付的。</p>
<p>（八）一般的練習步驟</p>
<p>拍乒乓要進步，一定要經過相當的步驟，按部就班的練習，進步就會快。譬如小孩子學跑路一樣，先要會立，再好學走。走路很穩當了，才好學跑。立還不會，呌他去走，當然是不可能，呌他跑，自然更辦不到了。</p>
<p>練習乒乓，先要把守做基礎。就是和人比賽，也要先守，保持不輸，然後再看機會，加以攻擊。</p>
<p>守得方法很多，最初是要學「近擋球」．不論對方的球是輕抽重擊，在練習的都要把最忠實的態度回擊，只求多打幾次，延長練習的機會．這樣用心的練習，經過若干時間以後，經騐漸多，球性摸熟，無論何種更球，都有趁勢應接的能力．然後再練習「遠擋球」「削球」。各種守法練熟了，再進一步，練習「輕抽」。這種輕抽雖然沒有多大力量，但比較「削球」來得有力，可以防止對方的猛攻或是兇削，並且可以使來不準球不硬。輕抽練習有相當的把握以後，再在準的條件之下，逐漸加重「抽」的力量，達到猛攻硬敲的地步。</p>
<p>「近擋」是「遠擋」和「削球」的基本，「輕抽」是猛攻的基礎。所以練球要練守，要守先要練習「近擋」。「近擋」，「遠擋」，「削球」練好後，才好進一步練習輕抽猛攻。這種辦法，好想造房子先打宅腳，根深蒂固，危險自然很少了。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>由旗袍想起</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>細察女人旗袍的式樣，煞是有趣。</p>
<p>她們的式樣卅多年來並沒有根本的不同，但是却又無時無刻不在改變，改變的次數且愈來愈速。因此，到了花樣變窮，噱頭賣盡而無所施其技的時候，便索性回到若干年前的老式樣。總之：無非是由舊而新，由新而舊，由寬而緊，由緊而寬；忽而流行長，忽而流行短些，或以拉鍊代紐扣，旋而再從拉鍊回到紐扣。又因變的時間越來越快，旗袍的質料，也就越見低劣，因為反正一件旗袍沒多少時候好穿。又正因為如此，做旗袍的次數亦愈多，變花樣的次數便就更多了。</p>
<p>查女人們所以如此者無非要博得路人們以驚奇的眼睛，注目一視。但是變來改去，旗袍到底還是旗袍。因而旗袍的式樣，也就漸漸不能引起人們的靑睞了。</p>
<p>女士們且別誤會！本文的目的並不在旗袍，而是想借此以形容咱們的「財金政策」。因為近年來的財金措施，正和妳們身上的旗袍同工異曲呢。</p>
<p>例如：法幣行得太久了，難免覺得其「大大方方」的樣式太呆板，于是起而代此便是嬌小玲瓏的「金券」。金券的那副腔調，又令人看厭了，便又想試試「銀劵」看。</p>
<p>依據女人旗袍演變的法則，銀劵的式樣倘不是如怯幣那樣大小，便是比金券更小巧「可愛」，大約以後者的可能較多，因為金券流行的時間比法幣短了廿幾倍，那麼銀券的壽命能有幾何，就很難斷定，所以還是製得小巧，更單薄些為妙。</p>
<p>法幣雖沒有以「券」稱之，但其本質確只是個「券」字而已。須知這個「券」字，便是毛病的癥結所在，那麼金券·銀券，勢必同樣地都和法幣同病相憐。由金券而銀券，而銅券，而鉛券，而「洋鉛皮券」，這是一券不如一券的自然趨勢，正和女人旗袍花樣愈變得多，質料愈「退班」的道理初無二致。</p>
<p>由旗袍而說到「銀元券」，其實只是一種現實生活的聯想而已。尙望大人先生們不要以板起面孔的態度來讀此文，只一笑置之可也。</p>
<h3>發財的競選者</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>無論在什麼國家，參加地方或中央競選的人，不是有名，便是有錢有勢的。否則，對競選毫無號召與把握，不但浪費時間，精力與金錢，並且將自討沒趣。但是，在美國總統競選史中，却有一個無名無勢的小子，參加過競選，雖未成功，却居然發了一筆財。</p>
<p>這個利用競選發財的人，名呌喬治·佛蘭西斯·屈萊。他原本是一個沒沒無聞的平民，突然於一八七〇年宣佈，他將參加一八七二年的美國總統競選。屈萊沒有政治背景，也沒有贊助人。他只是說，自己是個民主黨員，要想經由民主黨提名。</p>
<p>他在提名會議舉行以前，在全　國各地積極活動了好幾個月。但是，在民主黨的提名會議中，屈萊的名字根本沒有被說起。</p>
<p>大家都頗覺遺憾，因為如此努力，竟吿白廢。但屈萊本人在競選失敗後，却毫不沮喪。數年之後，大家才發現：他的參加競選別有用意，不是為了名，而是為了利。</p>
<p>他舉行過好幾百次競選演講，入塲聽講的人，都要花錢買票。因為他參加競選與衆不同，沒有背景也沒有聲勢，所以每次演講雖須收門票，但懷着好奇心來　的入　依然不少，數百次演講下來，屈萊居然收到了十萬元左右美金的門渠。從此他「退出政治舞台」，安逸在鄕作寓公了。</p>
<h3>天下鱗爪</h3>

<h3>街頭盡是大頭聲</h3>
<p>— 余忘我</p>
<h3>「哀樂中年」先覩記</h3>
<p>— 李瑞雲</p>
<p>一個偶然的機會，看到了「哀樂中年」的秘密試片。看過「假鳳虛凰」及「太太萬歲」的觀衆，一致公認桑弧先生無論是編，是導，都是製作喜劇的高手；在這部新的作品中，桑弧先生對喜劇的處理又更進了一步。他已經越過了「製造喜劇」（卽所謂噱頭）的階段，而讓戯的本身來給予觀衆一種「喜的感覺」。所以全劇的進展，平穩，冲淡，彷彿一首淸麗的詩篇，然而每一個鏡頭，每一呎膠片，都有深度的含蓄，使人起會心的微笑。</p>
<p>石揮從「假鳳虛凰」到「人盡可夫」，他的演技毫無疑義地有了定型。有人說過，他導演的「母親」，那個沈揚就是石揮自己的影子。「哀樂中年」中的小學校長，由於劇本及導演的帮助，他也突破了停滯着的界綫，而向桑弧先生看齊了。女主角朱嘉琛，據聞是導演看到了「大團圓」裏的三妹，而挽友情商的。劉敏華這個角色的性格，固然在她精湛的表演之下，强有力的形象化了，尤其是石揮向她求婚的那一塲戯，這是全劇的頂點，出是表演的頂點。她將潛伏在心底的熱情暴露無餘，而沒有一點勉强過火的感覺。這個銀幕新人的崛起，我們應該寄以遠大的期望。</p>
<p>「哀樂中年」的故事，是寫一個中年人的哀樂情懷，他有充沛的生命力，而他的環境迫使他做一個頤養天年的老太爺，這種强自遏制的情感終於暴發，他將他賸餘的生命力付給了社會。劇作者在這裏諷婉地說明了一般中年人以優遊的態度來排遺歲月，是生命的浪費。他借着劉敏華的對白，來傳達了他的意念：一像你這樣的年齡，學問有了，經騐也够了，這是人生最成熟的一個階段，這個階段要不好好地利用，實在是太可惜了！」（大意）最後以「陳氏墓園」改為「陳氏小學」，一個新的小生命也同時誕生。陳紹常說：「我覺得我的生命剛開始，就跟他一樣。」更是一個有力的啟示。</p>
<p>「哀樂中年」是一個淸新，流利，而有含蓄有力量的好戯。</p>
<h3>銀元銘</h3>
<p>— 丕基</p>
<p>幣不在巨（指金圓券），有價則名；頭不在新（指孫小頭），能大則靈。斯是銀元，惟質久馨。多年不露白，一旦又逢靑；操縱有豪富，收藏無白丁。可以調瑟琴，壯神經。聽可噹之悅耳，免貶跌之勞形。慣親門似海，怕見室如亭。措大云：何銀之有！（移酬助學）</p>
<h3>出血</h3>
<p>— 心秀</p>
<p>一般有鈔票做投機的人們，時常在說着：「出銀進金」，或「出金進鈔」。這一買一賣的進出之間，銀元金元就「得來全不費工夫」地滾滾而來。</p>
<p>我們窮揹大，旣無金也無銀，一無可出，只有出血，出汗。一天到晚埋頭在耗心血，這是無形的血；更可憐的是那些擠奶婦，拋下自己的兒女，去餵養人家的孩子；還有那些在醫院裏，給病人接血的人，那更是名符其實的出血了。</p>
<p>婚喪喜慶的紅白帖子，一張又一張的飛到你的寫字檯上，使你不得不掏出腰包來「送禮如儀」。那也是一種硬傷的出血啊！</p>
<h3>燈塔種種</h3>
<p>— 章卿</p>
<p>自己在一所燈塔裏工作，偶然翻閱到作家和詩人之流對於燈塔的錯誤的描寫，因而回想我目己從前也有這樣的錯誤時，往往使我啞然失笑。這大概是因為燈塔這一個機構，對一般人太陌生之故吧。</p>
<p>在普通人的想像中，燈塔在晚間發出的光芒，足以把四週黑暗的大海照耀得如同白畫一樣。其實，這是不確的。燈塔裏發出的光，雖光力達數十萬支燭光，但也僅不過是一種「信號」而己。說出來恐怕你還不相信，在孤島上的燈塔裏，他們自己用來過夜的，祗不過幾盞普通的火油燈罷了。燈塔的設立，原是為了遼遠海面上往來的航輪，所以燈塔發射的光與海面成平行綫，旣不朝上，也不向下，因此燈塔裏面的人們，並不能分享到絲毫光明。</p>
<p>燈塔旣是一種航行的標誌，所以世界上的燈塔雖有極多，但每一隻塔的形式，高度，以及外表所漆的顏色，都各自不同。對於航海者，這些不同處，便是一個極大的方便。到了晚上，每一隻塔發出的光也都各有不同，非但閃光明暗的時間有長短不同，有的燈塔還發射數種顏色光綫，以增加航行的警覺性。航海者就根據這燈塔各別的特點，來測定和計算他的航輪凖確的位置。</p>
<p>當我們翻開地圖的時候，就能看見幾乎所有的航綫都要經過許多大大小小的島嶼和海岬，以及散佈在四週的暗礁明岩。這些就是海上交通最大的敵人，它們都像埋伏着的妖魔海怪一樣，隨時有吞食航輪的野心。航海者在白天固然可籍了島嶼不同的形狀，避開危險的所在，但在晚上，就等於「盲人騎瞎馬」，毫無保障，到處有闖禍的危險。假使一個航海者在晚上航行的時候，如果不能發現一個預期中看得到的燈塔的話，那他的焦急，眞非言語所可形容。因為「差之毫厘，失以千里」，一個不對，就可能是這隻航輪的終了。所以燈塔不啻是航海者的天使，這些天使們保障了航行的安全。有些燈塔備有無綫電，雷達，霧警號，信號砲等裝置，大霧一起，航行危險的時候，就馬上發出音響，警吿來往的船隻，使它們不致進退失措而闖大禍。</p>
<p>正因為大多數的燈塔都設立在危險惡的孤島上，在這孤島上按時放光和發警號的工作人員，就過着一種相當寂寞艱苦的生活。這些孤島在平時也幾乎人跡罕至，一到起風作浪的時候，孤島的交通便和外界完全切斷。那時與工作人員朝夕相對的，就是那眼面前洶湧的海浪，和脚底下無情的沙石了。　—寫於澎湖北島燈塔</p>

<h3>The Negotiations Face a Showdown: Government to Decide Today, Firmly Rejecting the Communist Army's Demand to Cross the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The peace negotiations have reached a critical stage, and the draft domestic peace agreement proposed by the Chinese Communists has caused unprecedented difficulties for the government. All day on the 18th, Acting President Li, Premier He, and other key officials held separate contacts to exchange opinions, which continued until after midnight. A general consensus has been reached, and it was decided that He Yingqin would invite the Acting President, Yu Youren, Tong Guanxian, Zhang Qun, Ju Zheng, Bai Chongxi, Zhu Jiahua, and others to hold an important meeting on the morning of the 19th to discuss and make a final decision on the government's response to the Chinese Communists. It is also reported that the government may issue a statement on the afternoon of the 19th to clarify its position. Based on the results of the exchange of opinions among key officials throughout the 18th, almost all believe that the eight articles and twenty-four clauses are actually terms of surrender. An authoritative official source stated: "The He Cabinet is a peace cabinet, and it is genuinely seeking peace. What the people need is true and fair peace, not peace through surrender." The official source's remarks included the possibility that the government would find it extremely difficult to accept such conditions.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The government will make a final decision on the Chinese Communists' demands at an important meeting to be held on the 19th, convened by He Yingqin. Ju Zheng, Wu Tiecheng, and Zhu Jiahua will also return to Shanghai from Xikou on the morning of the 19th, change planes, and fly to Nanjing to attend the important meeting. On the evening of the 18th, official sources attached great importance to the meeting, believing that it would be key to determining whether the area south of the Yangtze River would be surrendered.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Among the Chinese Communists' eight articles and twenty-four clauses, the demand that the Communist army cross the Yangtze River from eight strongholds after the signing of the peace agreement, station troops in major cities, and supervise the reorganization of the army has become the most difficult issue in the negotiations. As a result of the exchange of opinions among government officials over the past two days, the 17th and 18th, it is generally considered unacceptable. The meeting convened by He Yingqin on the 19th will further discuss this matter. According to well-informed sources on the evening of the 18th, the government has decided to reject the Chinese Communists' demand for the Communist army to cross the Yangtze River. However, the manner in which the government will express its rejection will be discussed at the meeting on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Huang Shaohong went to the Central Hospital on the 18th for a medical examination. His return to Beiping is undecided and will reportedly be determined at the meeting on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Content of the Ten Most Important of the Twenty-Four Clauses Proposed by the Chinese Communists; Acting President Li Denies Sending a Telegram to Mao Zedong</h3>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] A local evening newspaper reported on the 18th that Acting President Li sent a telegram to Mao Zedong on the morning of the 18th, requesting an extension of the signing date of the peace agreement proposed by the Chinese Communists. On the evening of the 18th, a government spokesperson officially denied this. It was stated that Acting President Li did not send a telegram to Mao Zedong on the 18th requesting an extension.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Wu Tiecheng arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 16th and went to eastern Zhejiang the next morning to visit Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in Fenghua. He did not meet with Huang Shaohong before his departure, nor did he learn the full text of the twenty-four clauses proposed by the Chinese Communists. Wu Tiecheng returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the night train of the 18th.</p>
<h3>Third-Party Figures' Trip to Beiping Undecided</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] As of last night, the number of people and the departure date for the third party's trip to Beiping at the invitation of the Chinese Communists have not been determined. According to Luo Longji, he only learned about this matter from the newspapers, and the government has not yet sent anyone to discuss it in person. He plans to consider it further after clarifying the situation. Zhang Lan's opinion is the same as his.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee Rejects the Proposal to Simplify the Organization of the Examination Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee reviewed the proposal by Zhou Jieren and others to "revise the Organic Law of the Examination Yuan, abolish the Ministry of Examinations, and have its business directly handled by the Examination Yuan, and reduce the Ministry of Personnel to a Personnel Department to simplify and save public funds." Tian Jiongjin, Minister of Examinations, attended the meeting to report. The committee members spoke one after another, believing that combining examination and personnel administration was unreasonable, and that the Examination Yuan having two ministries under it was not too large and should not be abolished. Most advocated retaining the original proposal, and the result of the vote was to reject it.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Two Committees of the Legislative Yuan Reviews the Internal Organization Law; Li Han-hun Attends and Reports</h3>

<h3>Kuomintang Central Executive Committee Issues a Statement on the Current Peace Negotiations: National Independence and Freedom Are Not to Be Changed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] The Kuomintang Central Executive Committee issued a statement on the current peace negotiations on the 18th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"In January of this year, President Chiang issued a proclamation, willing to re-discuss with the Chinese Communist Party the cessation of war and the restoration of peace, and revealed specific methods for peace. As long as the peace agreement does not harm the independence and integrity of the country, and helps the people recuperate, as long as the sacred Constitution is not violated, democracy is not undermined, the national system of the Republic of China can be ensured, the legal system of the Republic of China will not be interrupted, the army has real protection, and the people can maintain their free lives and current minimum living standards, then individual advances, retreats, and positions will not be taken to heart, and all the public opinion of the people will be followed. His painstaking efforts to plan for the country and his open attitude have aroused a unanimous response throughout the country.</p>
<p>On January 21 of this year, President Chiang, in order to achieve the goal of eliminating war, resolutely issued a statement, deciding to take the lead in retiring and, in accordance with the Constitution, Vice President Li would act as President. He hoped that the military and civilians throughout the country and governments at all levels would unite and assist Acting President Li in working together to promote lasting peace. At the same time, he reiterated his advocacy of saving the people from fire and water, preserving the nation's vitality, ensuring the integrity of territory and sovereignty, preventing the destruction of history, culture, and social order, and ensuring the people's lives, freedoms, and rights.</p>
<p>President Chiang is the Director-General of our party. The above two proclamations were issued after obtaining unanimous agreement from the Central Committee of our party. The consistent aim of the Founder of our Party is to realize the Three Principles of the People in order to establish a solid foundation for the country and seek world peace. President Chiang's advocacy truly represents the traditional spirit of sacrifice and loyalty to the country for the past fifty years. Therefore, all comrades of our party are working together to support this advocacy.</p>
<p>Relying on the Public Opinion of the People and the Party to Support Acting President and Premier He</p>
<p>Since Acting President Li assumed the duties of President, he has actively engaged in seeking a path to peace negotiations with the spirit of enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, based on the inspiration of the above two proclamations. Ultimately, relying on the urging of public opinion and the support of national discourse, both sides' representatives were able to begin peace negotiations in Beiping on the first of this month. From then on, a glimmer of peace began to appear, and domestic compatriots and friendly countries around the world unanimously focused their attention on the results of these peace negotiations as a key to the importance of the governance and security of China and the world.</p>
<p>During the peace negotiations, the most regrettable or obstructive factor was the smog of rumors. These rumors are largely due to the arduousness of the peace negotiations, and those responsible for the peace negotiations have a cautious and fearful attitude, unwilling to disclose information casually. In order to remove obstacles to the peace negotiations, our party will once again state its consistent position on the peace negotiations in order to correct the views of China and foreign countries.</p>
<p>First, we want to make it clear to the people of the country that the tasks currently shouldered by Acting President Li and Premier He are based on the Constitution of the Republic of China, and their tasks to our party are to implement the decisions of the party. What Acting President Li and Premier He rely on to negotiate peace with the Communist Party is the public opinion of the people and our party. The people and our party support Acting President Li and Premier He based on their advocacy of peace negotiations. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of our party made a resolution on peace negotiations on the seventh of this month, with five principles:</p>
<p>Five Principles for Sincere Peace Seeking, Maintaining the Spirit of Independence and Autonomy</p>
<p>(1) In order to show sincerity in seeking peace and demonstrate credibility to the people, both sides should immediately order a ceasefire and have their troops remain in their original defenses at the beginning of the peace negotiations.</p>
<p>If the Communist army crosses the Yangtze River during the peace negotiations, it will indicate that they have no sincerity in seeking peace. The government should immediately recall its representatives and declare that the responsibility for the breakdown of the peace negotiations lies with the Communist Party.</p>
<p>(2) In order to maintain the spirit of national independence and autonomy and fulfill the responsibilities entrusted by the United Nations Charter, foreign policies aimed at promoting international cooperation and maintaining world peace should be maintained.</p>
<p>(3) In order to effectively safeguard the people's free way of life, all policies of using violence should be stopped, and the people's freedoms, rights, and property should be protected by law.</p>
<p>(4) The armies of both sides should reorganize themselves in their respective defense zones under equal conditions. The reorganization plan must have guarantees that both sides respect each other and implement them simultaneously.</p>
<p>(5) The organizational form and composition of the government should ensure the implementation of the above-mentioned principles 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<p>On the 14th of this month, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of our party made a supplementary resolution on the fifth of the above-mentioned peace negotiation principles. The resolution stated that before the constitutional amendment procedures are signed, both sides should agree to demarcate jurisdictional areas and engage in peaceful construction separately. After the Constitution is amended, the government should be organized in accordance with the Constitution.</p>
<p>This is the position of our party on the current peace negotiations. It is hereby issued to clear up social confusion.</p>
<p>Our party believes that the outcome of the peace negotiations is of great importance to the future of the nation and the people. No political party can weigh it solely based on the rights and interests of its own party. On the contrary, those who do so will be spurned by the people of the whole country. Since the founding of our party by the Founder of the Nation, its permanent belief has been the Three Principles of the People, and its ultimate goal is to seek national and people's welfare and lasting world peace. The struggle for more than fifty years, through all kinds of hardships, has not deviated from this goal. What our party seeks is only to ensure the survival of the nation and the people and the realization of the Three Principles of the People. It has never had the idea of monopolizing national power by one party. If the nation, the people, and the Three Principles of the People cannot be ensured, then sacrifice and struggle to fulfill its divine duty to save the country and the people will be worth dying for, without complaint. This is our party's inescapable responsibility to the history of the Republic of China. If it is not done in this way, it will be a traitor to the Founder of the Nation and a criminal to the martyrs. This heart is clear and can be questioned by the world. Now that our party has led the War of Resistance to success, the country's vitality is greatly damaged, and the people's livelihood is difficult. They all hope to recuperate. We should strive to promote the implementation of the Three Principles of the People by peaceful means. What our party comrades are fighting for is only the advocacy of national affairs, and we will never care about the rights of parties or individuals. What we hope that the Communist Party members should understand is that the details of the peace negotiation conditions should be carefully drafted by the representatives of both sides with great patience, so that they are feasible and must be implemented. No matter what, there are things that cannot be done hastily, such as the name of the Republic of China must not be changed, the basic freedoms and rights of the people granted by the Constitution must not be deprived, the integrity and independence of national sovereignty must not be harmed, so that the Chinese nation becomes cannon fodder for others, and the reform of the social economy must not be carried out by violent means, so that a moribund society replays the tragedy of liquidation. All these minimum limits are clearly and obviously stated to the whole country. People have the same heart, and the criteria for national affairs are based on this. If this limit is exceeded, not only will there be no way to face the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in creating the Republic of China, eliminating warlords, and resisting Japanese invaders, but also our 450 million compatriots will be plunged into an abyss from which they can never escape. Not only our party should not remain silent, but also the compatriots of the whole country must have a collective expression of justice. The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang."</p>
<h3>Proposal to Reasonably Adjust the Treatment of Public School Teachers and Civil Servants to Be Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Discussion Today; The Establishment of the Military Expenditure Budget Has Also Been Included on the Agenda</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] At the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 19th, the following will be discussed: the draft Organic Law of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; the proposal to reasonably adjust the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants; the proposal to abolish and merge military organs, strictly prohibit vacancies in the army, establish the military expenditure budget, increase the treatment of soldiers, and ensure actual expenditures; the proposal to establish special articles to sanction market monopolies, so as to avoid unreasonable price fluctuations and stabilize people's livelihoods; and the proposal to request the government to protect industries throughout the country and prevent damage from war, so as to maintain national vitality and facilitate production.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The National Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the afternoon of the 18th, chaired by Zhang Zhijiang. They reviewed the administrative guidelines of the Executive Yuan and the military-related parts of the political reform outline proposed by committee members Zou Shuwen and Tang Jiyao. The committee members spoke enthusiastically, generally believing that current military expenditures were huge and the treatment of the national army was very poor. This was actually due to the large number of personnel attached to the army. In the future, a policy of elite troops should be adopted, salaries should be paid in full, non-combatant personnel in the army should be reduced as much as possible, and military expenditures must be gradually reduced to the lowest possible level. The budget should not exceed 50% of the total budget. The revised draft prepared by the seven-member group elected at the previous meeting was passed item by item and will be submitted to the next meeting of the Yuan for discussion.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Finance and Banking Committee and the Legal System Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting on the morning of the 18th to review Wang Lihang's proposal to "reform the national financial institutions," Wu Shiheng's proposal to "reform the banking system," and Zhang Jingyu's proposal to "revise the Organic Law of the Central Bank." Zhang Jingyu, the chairman, first explained the significance of reforming the Central Bank and other financial institutions, and put forward a written opinion on the legislative principles for revising the Organic Law of the Central Bank. Wang Lihang believes that the bureaucratic habits of the Central Bank must be thoroughly reformed, and a supervisory and review committee should be established with the participation of people's representatives. Personnel should also be reorganized, and it is advocated that state-owned banks and financial institutions should be nationalized, unified, socialized, and democratized in the future. The proposal to abolish commercial banks was then discussed. The committee members generally believed that commercial banks had many drawbacks, but due to constitutional provisions, it was inconvenient to abolish them. However, they should be strictly managed in the future and their units should be reduced as much as possible. At the afternoon meeting, the committee members advocated that, except for the name of the Central Bank, which should be retained, the Bank of China should be merged with the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China should be merged with the Cooperative Bank. As for whether to retain two or three state-owned banks, the number of committee members present did not meet the legal quorum. The matter was left for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>A Subcommittee Decides on Eight Principles for Issuing Special Public Bonds</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding the "issuance of special relief public bonds" proposed by Legislative Yuan member Yang Baodong and others, the review subcommittee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the afternoon of the 18th and passed eight principles: (1) The name of the public bond is set as special public bonds, and its purpose is to subsidize the balance of the national budget; (2) The amount of the public bond is set at 2 million taels of gold; (3) The public bond is compulsorily allocated to wealthy households and merchants in large cities with a population of more than 100,000. Those who voluntarily subscribe will be given preferential rewards; (4) The public bond is interest-free, and repayment will begin after three years, with the bond being cleared in five years; (5) The public bond can be used to offset property taxes; (6) If those assigned to subscribe do not pay, the government may sell their property to offset it; (7) In addition to gold, the public bond can be paid in foreign currency, silver, silver dollars, or gold yuan coupons converted at market prices, and the government will repay in the same way; (8) The issuance of public bonds should be as fast as possible. The above review opinions will be discussed at a meeting of the Finance and Banking Committee before being reported to the Yuan meeting.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The fierce fighting in Taiyuan has increased unabated. The invading Communist army has increased to twelve regiments and an artillery division. The fighting on the 18th was fiercest in the east and northwest of the city. In the east, the Communist army, under the cover of artillery, launched a fierce attack on the national army positions in the direction of Sanershu throughout the day, but were repelled.

<h3>The Situation North of the Yangtze River Increasingly Urgent; Communist Army Vows to Cross the River Before the 25th; Yong'anzhou Southeast of the Port Captured</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 18th] The Communist army of Chen Yi and Su Yu north of the Yangtze River has been continuously attacking several bridgehead positions of the Nationalist army on the north bank, such as Shierxu and Tuqiao (southwest of Yangzhou), and Yuxikou (opposite Wuhu). At the same time, they have also declared that they will launch a large-scale crossing of the Yangtze River before the 25th with three army corps. According to reports, they will use Gaoqiao (opposite Taigang, east of Zhenjiang), Yong'anzhou (south of the port), and Tiexin, Peiwen, and Shangguan islands in the middle of the river near Anqing as springboards for advancing south of the Yangtze River. The Nationalist army is on high alert. Furthermore, the Communist army has recently dug up and destroyed the original embankments in various low-lying areas on the north bank of the Yangtze River. According to aerial reconnaissance reports over the past two days, the most extensive damage is to the embankments from Tuqiao opposite Tongling in central Anhui, through Liujiadu to Wuwei, and from Wuwei southeast to Yaojiawan, totaling over a hundred li in length. The remaining scattered excavations have not yet been listed. According to reports, the Communist army's digging is intended to raise the water level during floods, divert water into the fields, and facilitate the entry of boats, thereby facilitating their attack on the south of the Yangtze River. They disregard the farmers' livelihoods and crops, causing the farmers in these areas to lament endlessly.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 18th] From the night of the 17th, the Communist army's 34th Army of the Chen Yi's faction attacked the Nationalist army's bridgehead strongholds Shierxu and Tuqiao, northwest of Zhenjiang, opposite the river. After the Nationalist army, led by Wang Zuohua, with the assistance of the navy, made every effort to resist, fierce fighting continued until the evening of the 18th. Furthermore, Yong'anzhou, southeast of the port, was attacked on the night of the 17th by two regiments of Chen Yi's 27th Army, who took advantage of the heavy fog and artillery cover to land from Longxiaogang, Madian, and Longwo, north of Taiyu. After the Nationalist army inflicted heavy casualties on them in Shangqiao, Laowei, and Shiwuxu, they were eventually forced to retreat under the cover of the air force and navy after dawn on the 18th due to the disparity in numbers. As for Beishazhou, south of Yong'anzhou, aerial reconnaissance reports this afternoon indicated that the Communist army that landed on Yong'anzhou had increased to one division. A large number of ships were also gathered in the Sanjiangying, Gaoqiao, Kou'an, and Xingang areas. Over twenty ships were sunk. In the Sanjiangying area, over 500 Communist soldiers crossed the river to invade Xinbaizhen, northwest of Yangzhong, but were completely repelled by the defending troops.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 18th] Parts of the Communist army's 20th and 23rd Armies launched attacks on the Nationalist army's positions in Yong'anzhou (northeast of Zhenjiang, across the river) from Sima Town and Ximadian in two routes on the night of the 17th. Currently, the Nationalist army has partially retreated to Maoshan.</p>
<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch on the 18th] Recently, over a thousand local communists, carrying over 800 rifles and over ten machine guns, were suddenly discovered in the Mujiating Shizishan Chishazhou area (bordering Fanchang County) in the northwest of Nanling, attempting to seize Nationalist army positions along the Yangtze River when necessary, establish bridgeheads, and welcome the crossing of the Yangtze River by the Communist army from the north bank. The Nationalist army has now dispatched troops to encircle and suppress them.</p>
<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch on the 18th] There were only minor skirmishes in the suburbs of Anqing on the 18th. However, a large number of Communist troops have recently gathered on the islands of Tiexin, Shangguan, and Peiwen, south of Shankouzhen, west of Anqing, declaring that they will concentrate three army corps, approximately 100,000 men, to cross the Yangtze River in a large-scale operation before the 25th. The 16th Army of Chen Geng's faction, with two divisions, will be in the first line, with the remainder in the second line. The Communist army is currently strengthening fortifications on various islands and setting up artillery positions along the riverbank. Their headquarters are located in Hongjiapu, approximately 30 kilometers west of Anqing.</p>
<p>[Our Hengdian Dispatch on the 18th] Military sources: The Communist army in the Huangmei and Guangji area of eastern Hubei is now actively preparing to cross the Yangtze River. They have already printed various maps of the areas along the river in southern Hubei, and have conducted particularly detailed surveys of the terrain around Wuhan. Furthermore, Chen Geng's faction has also established a Yangtze River crossing training class in Huangchuan, southern Henan. The main courses are practicing swimming and rowing. The Communist soldiers in training must take turns practicing in the Huai River every day. According to reports from returned prisoners, the Communist army in eastern Hubei and the Dabie Mountains area numbers approximately three armies, totaling less than 100,000 men, including local communists on the border of Henan and Anhui. (2) Over a thousand Communist soldiers west of the Pinghan Railway attempted to attack Xiaogan last night. After being intercepted by local militia forces ten li from the city, they immediately retreated.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 18th] During the lull in the fighting on various fronts, many generals who had come to Hankou have recently left Hankou one after another to return to their defense posts.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Test of Whether to Surrender</h3>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party's attitude towards peace talks was revealed in its entirety the day before yesterday. In a nutshell, it is to order the National Government in Nanjing to surrender unconditionally.</p>
<p>The current question is simply: Are the civil and military officials of the National Government, from Acting President Li down, willing to meekly obey orders and instruct their peace representatives to sign the surrender agreement? In essence, it is making the National Government face the test of whether to surrender.</p>
<p>No one does not desire peace; no one wants to continue or expand the war. However, to have the National Government sign a surrender agreement without the consent of the people, forcing all 450 million people of China into the Iron Curtain to become slaves of the Communist Party and cannon fodder for the Soviet Union, is highly questionable whether people are willing and eager for such a thing. Those who unconditionally echo and American friends who are scratching an itch from afar seem to be right in saying that the Chinese people are tired of war, but they have overlooked one point: that the Chinese people are particularly averse to being controlled by the Communist Party and fighting for the Soviet Union. Rather than surrendering for the sake of temporary peace and being forced to fight for the Soviet Union in the future, we believe that the Chinese people would rather not have this temporary peace.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong, representing the Chinese Communist Party, broadcasted on January 12 in the posture of a victor, putting forward the so-called eight conditions, namely (1) punish war criminals, (2) abolish the constitution, (3) abolish the legal system, (4) reorganize government troops, (5) confiscate bureaucratic capital, (6) reform the land system, (7) abolish traitorous treaties, and (8) establish a democratic coalition government. This was originally a response to the five principles mentioned by President Chiang in his New Year's message. On January 27, Acting President Li, without going through the decision of the Executive Yuan, suddenly telegraphed Mao, saying that "the government has recognized that these eight conditions can be used as the basis for peace talks." As a result, the atmosphere of peace talks suddenly became hot and cold. After many twists and turns, the CCP finally delivered the so-called "Revised Draft Agreement" of eight articles and twenty-four clauses to the Nanjing delegation on the 15th of this month, and set a deadline of the 20th of this month for signing. Huang Shaohong, this enthusiastic peace talk representative, spared no effort to fly back to Nanjing for instructions. At the same time, the CCP suddenly broadcasted in Beiping, announcing the process of the peace talks, but the so-called "Nanjing delegation" and the National Government in Nanjing dared not reveal the contents of this ultimatum of eight articles and twenty-four clauses until 6:00 p.m. yesterday, deeply fearing that unilateral disclosure would offend the CCP.</p>
<p>However, from what Chinese and foreign reporters have learned from various sources, the harshness of the CCP's conditions is unimaginable. For example, (1) overthrow the constitution, (2) change the name and flag of the country, (3) abolish the Six Codes, (4) dissolve the National Assembly and the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, (5) all levels of government, central and local, will be taken over by the coalition government (anti-communists in the Kuomintang will of course have no part), (6) the chairman and members of the highest decision-making committee of the coalition government will be selected by the CCP, (7) government military forces will be reorganized in accordance with the Beiping reorganization method, (8) the Communist army will "peacefully cross the Yangtze River" in Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Anqing, and Jiujiang to supervise the reorganization of the troops, (9) the navy and air force should be handed over within a time limit, (10) in addition to confiscating the property of the four major families, all places with active funds of more than 10,000 silver dollars should be confiscated at different levels and in proportion, (11) the land of all large and middle landlords should be liquidated, (12) all treaties and agreements between China and the United States should be regarded as traitorous treaties and should be repealed, and (13) the United States "should return all rights and interests that have been historically infringed upon in China to the United Government of China," etc., are all important clauses. In addition, there are two additional clauses: (1) the Communist army must be stationed in ten places, including Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Changsha, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and Kunming, and (2) President Chiang must leave the country immediately. After reading these clauses, most people believe that the arrogance of the CCP is so great that it cannot be compared with the attitude of the government at the Political Consultative Conference when the CCP was propagandaed to be oppressed by the government.</p>
<p>We believe that under the major premise of sincerely seeking peace, what the National Government in Nanjing should consider is not the issue of war criminals, nor should it be the issue of President Chiang's personal residence, but should focus on how the people will suffer in the future and what the country's future situation will be. In other words, do the people have freedom, and can the country be independent? If the above two key elements are sacrificed in order to accept these conditions, then it is surrender. This surrender, although it may allow for temporary (?) peace, will ultimately plunge China into the Iron Curtain and cause the Chinese people to suffer greater war disasters in future world wars.</p>
<p>The "Republic of China" and the "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth" national flag, which were formed by the blood of countless martyrs and compatriots who have flowed through more than 30 years of revolution and resistance, are now to be wiped out with a single stroke. The Japanese and Wang Jingwei and others did not dare to completely fabricate this, but now they are actually trying to do it. This indicates, on the one hand, that it is full of feudal ideas of "changing dynasties," and on the other hand, that it must follow the Soviet Union step by step. Moreover, a coalition government chaired by CCP personnel and manipulated by the CCP will inevitably implement the statement they broadcasted on the 3rd of this month, "Unite the people of the whole country... and join hands with China's ally, the Soviet Union, to defeat the invaders." Then, the future of China, in addition to being dragged into the "sickle and hammer" group by the CCP, making the people of the whole country cannon fodder for the Soviet Union, will have no other path. Compatriots, please think about it: Under such a coalition government, can China still be considered an independent country? Can China still have "true peace"? No wonder all treaties and agreements between China and the United States should be abolished, while the Sino-Soviet Treaty, which ceded Outer Mongolia and the rights and interests in Northeast China, is regarded as sacred and inviolable, and not a word is mentioned!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the old laws are abolished before the new laws are promulgated, and the civil, criminal, and commercial laws are all thrown into the toilet, making China a "country without laws" in name and in reality, not to mention the constitution. The National Assembly, the source of political power, and the legislative and supervisory agencies are all dissolved. We do not know who will dissolve them. Is it Acting President Li? Acting President Li himself was elected by the National Assembly. What power does he have to dissolve the National Assembly? What power does he have to amend the constitution? If the name is not correct, then the words will not be smooth. In addition to revolutionizing himself, Acting President Li has no authority to do these things. With all laws abolished, the freedom of the people and the inherent human rights are naturally completely unprotected. The liquidation and confiscation of property goes without saying. How can many people who used to tout democracy and freedom still protect their freedom under a government without laws? The compatriots who "fled south" from the Communist areas in Northeast China, North China, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui, including intellectuals, business people, and even distressed farmers, all say that in those places, the CCP leaders "say and follow the law" (because there is no law, so their words are the law), which has made people lose all "interest in life" and have the spirit of "if you hear the Tao (the Communist Tao) in the morning, you can die in the evening." "When will you perish? I will perish with you." This is the unspeakable mood of the people in the Communist areas today. If the Communist army crosses the Yangtze River and controls all of China, no matter what their rural policies are or what their urban policies are, it is certain that the people will lose all freedom. Many people who now consider learning to twist the Yangge dance fashionable and who echo and criticize the Kuomintang and the National Government as "progressing" will not be able to breathe the air of freedom at that time, or they may not be able to regret it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the country's situation today is very simple, and can be decided in one word. Those who run the government, if they are great statesmen, should consider the long-term interests of the people and the country, and decide on this one word. Then what is this "one word decision"? It is: when the CCP is unwilling to withdraw its excessive demands of eight articles and twenty-four clauses and insists on crossing the Yangtze River, the government and the people only have to choose between "surrender" and "war," and there is no such thing as "peace." Unless blessed by the heavens, the CCP changes its attitude and calmly renegotiates, the government can continue its peace talks. In the next two days, the government is indeed facing the test of whether to surrender, and what will our people do?</p>

<h3>The Northeast After the "Eastern Iron Curtain": Eating Has "Class" Distinctions – Small Stove, Medium Stove, Large Stove; Residents Cannot Travel Beyond a Hundred Li, No Freedom of Speech</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Hu Yucai, Deputy Manager of the Shenyang Branch of the Central Bank, Shen Muqian, Chief of the Issuance Department, Zhou Zhenhao, and others, departed Shenyang successively after its capture. Zhou Zhenhao left Shenyang for Ping on February 11th, a journey that lasted more than twenty days. They arrived in Qingdao on the 14th and spoke at length with a reporter from this newspaper, allowing a glimpse into the recent conditions of the Northeast after the Eastern Iron Curtain. The valuable information regarding economic life is worthy of reference by all parties. The content of their conversation is as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou described the hardships he experienced leaving Panjin. The Communists issued travel passes. Captured Nationalist soldiers were issued "Liberation Certificates." Production personnel in Communist organizations (i.e., those engaged in business) could travel with "Production Travel Passes." Aside from these, ordinary people had absolutely no freedom of movement. From the Communist army's entry into the city on November 2nd of last year until February 11th, the travel passes they issued did not allow travel beyond one hundred and twenty li from Panjin. People who obtained travel passes had to have them stamped by the Communist army's law enforcement team at the train station before being allowed to buy tickets. However, automobile drivers did not need to carry travel passes. Mr. Zhou managed to obtain a driver's position and drove a 1939 Ford truck out of Shenyang on February 11th. It is said that after the Shenyang branch of the Central Bank was renamed the Northeast Bank branch, Central Bank personnel were given five to fifteen days to report. Those willing to stay were promised their original positions and salaries. Those unwilling to stay also had to complete the handover. Those who engaged in destructive acts without orders from the Nationalist government would be punished. At that time, the Communist takeover work was so chaotic it was beyond description. Therefore, they used all sorts of tricks to retain old personnel. Trainees from the Harbin Bank training class arrived successively. Their cultural level was extremely low; they were full of terms but did not understand their meaning, creating endless jokes. The majority of them probably only had a primary school education and did not know many Chinese characters. At that time, the exchange rate for Northeast circulating currency was 300,000 to 1.0, and the exchange had to be completed within one week. Later, they claimed that the Military Control Commission had not yet been established, and those who wished to resign still could not leave. Immediately, they began forced training to change their thinking. Every day, from 6:30 to 7:30 AM, they sang songs. At 8:00 AM, they ate. From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, they studied (or held small group meetings). From 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, they had discussion sessions. At 3:00 PM, they ate again. After repeated requests to honor their promises, most personnel finally received "Departure Certificates" on December 19th. Just as they were about to set out to the south, they were detained by the Public Security Bureau. Obtaining a travel pass was almost as difficult as ascending to heaven.</p>
<p>Within the Northeast Bank, food was divided into three grades (the meaning of this "grade" is not the class in Communist theory but the salary grade of the Communist Party, which is also the lifestyle promoted by the Communist Party). The same was true in other organizations. It was divided into small stove, medium stove, and large stove. The small stove was called health-care meals, enjoyed by the bank's general manager, Cao Juru, deputy general manager, Huang Qizhi, and section chiefs. Each table had four dishes (three meat and one vegetable) and one soup, with chicken, fish, and meat, and they ate rice, which was extremely lavish, incomparable to the government and banking sectors. The medium stove was much worse, used by the bank's section heads and former Central Bank personnel from deputy director upwards to deputy manager. It had two dishes (one meat and one vegetable, the so-called meat dish containing about two or three taels of meat at most) and one soup, with six people per table, two meals a day, one meal of sorghum and one meal of rice. As for the large stove, both meals were sorghum, and each meal was white cabbage and tofu soup, sometimes with vermicelli, called "standard dish," with no changes at all. It was used by former personnel below the deputy director level and ordinary colleagues, with no special meals or treats. The Communist Party's treatment was that its high-ranking personnel were on a supply system and did not need to submit expense reports. The Central Bank's three cars were used very frequently by them, consuming much more gasoline than in the Central Bank era. For example, the general manager, Cao Juru, had an old nanny in his home, but she was renamed "babysitter." According to the Communist Party's so-called new lifestyle and theory, Mrs. Cao had to serve the people, and the "babysitter" would take care of her children at home. It seems that in principle, each child should have one "babysitter." Since General Manager Cao had four or five children, he also needed the same number of "babysitters." This was in fact how it was done. However, such measures did not seem to be stipulated in the Communist Party's various pamphlets.</p>
<p>Their consumption of gasoline (left over from the past government) seemed unlimited, and they did not cherish it, which was surprising. At the beginning of this year, Soviet gasoline began to appear. It was estimated to be less than 70 octane, with extremely weak explosive power, a foul odor, and thick smoke. With one gallon of American gasoline, the 1939 Ford could travel twelve kilometers. With the red Soviet oil used by Mr. Zhou (seen in the rear during the War of Resistance), it could only travel six kilometers. The road surface was also slightly related. Under the worst road conditions, it sometimes only traveled eight li.</p>
<p>The only business of the Northeast Bank was as a public treasury. It had no accounting regulations and no business policy decisions. The Northeast was completely closed off in terms of finance, independent as a group, with no business contact with the People's Bank, and no exchange of currency. Northeast banknotes circulated up to Shanhaiguan, and People's banknotes circulated up to Qinhuangdao. Initially, it was set at 10 yuan of People's banknotes to 10,000 yuan of Northeast banknotes. Later, the exchange rate between Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao gradually changed, and People's banknotes had to be discounted. It has now fallen below 60%, that is, 10 yuan of People's banknotes can only be exchanged for more than 5,000 yuan of Northeast banknotes. Relatively speaking, Northeast banknotes are more stable. The cost of living in Beiping is appropriately twice as high as in Shenyang. The Northeast Bank opened the Dongxiang Gold Store in Shenyang. Although gold was freely traded, it was a monopoly and also sold jewelry. People were allowed to hold gold. The US dollar had no significant relationship to the Northeast banknote. On one occasion, US Vice Consul Hu Baode contacted them about this matter. At that time, it was temporarily decided to use gold as the standard, at 35 US dollars per tael, and then converted into Northeast banknotes.</p>
<p>Regarding transactions with the Soviet Union, according to direct information obtained, the Shenyang International Trade Company was established in early February, located opposite the South Railway Station, and was headed by purely Chinese merchants, supported by the Soviets. Its only export was food, and Soviet goods were crude industrial products, including colored cotton cloth and machine screw parts as the two major items. According to extremely reliable news from someone from Harbin, the transactions in northern Manchuria involved exchanging grain for military supplies (all "war booty" of the Soviet Union in the Northeast), with some machinery as well.</p>
<p>Comparing the three kinds of materials—gold, coal, and sorghum—in early November, gold was 45,000 yuan of Northeast banknotes per tael, coal was 60,000 yuan per ton, and sorghum was 2,500 yuan per jin. In early February, gold was 110,000 yuan per tael, coal had already soared to 120,000 yuan in December, which was related to the season, and sorghum was 6,000 yuan per jin in early February, an increase rate equal to that of gold. Soybeans had no market at all, with no trace of soybeans to be seen. North Korean merchants also came to Shenyang to exchange for grain, bringing mostly American lighters and other light goods brought in from South Korea, which shows that the Soviet Union and North Korea must have needed Northeastern grain.

<h3>Four-Power Talks Impossible Before Complete Lifting of the Berlin Blockade; State Department Reaffirms U.S. Stance; Reports of Soviet Special Envoy to Washington Still Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 18th, broadcast: Lake Success News. The Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Malik, today denied reports that he had suggested a peaceful solution to the Berlin issue to U.S. Representative Jessup. When asked if the above-mentioned news report by American radio commentator Pearson was accurate, Malik replied, "Pearson often fabricates news." When asked if the numerous peace messages coming from Berlin were all unreliable, Ma laughed in reply, "Sorry, no comment." When asked if there was any truth to the reports that the Soviet Union had sent a special envoy to Washington to discuss the entire Berlin issue, Ma shrugged his shoulders and did not answer.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The State Department on the 17th refused to comment on radio commentator Pearson's report that the Soviet Union had requested a comprehensive four-power conference on the German issue. State Department spokesman McDermott said that the State Department's position had been explained by Secretary of State Acheson in a statement last week, that the United States was always prepared to listen to any peaceful suggestions from the Soviet Union in the East-West Cold War. According to Pearson, the Soviet Union's suggestion was put forward through its representative to the United Nations, pointing out that they were willing to discuss the lifting of the Berlin blockade. The German currency issue. The separate West Germany and the withdrawal of the occupying forces of the four powers from Germany. Acheson salt said that the importance of this suggestion had been discussed with British Foreign Minister Bevin and French Foreign Minister Schuman. It is said that the State Department's reaction to the simultaneous withdrawal of troops by the four powers was particularly cold, because once the Western Allied forces withdrew from West Germany, the thousands of well-trained armed police in East Germany would pose a serious threat to West Germany. At the same time, Acheson and other American diplomats have repeatedly stated that the Berlin blockade must be lifted before the United States agrees to discuss any future issues in Germany.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] According to conservative newspapers here this morning, Malinin, who advised the Kremlin to adopt a blockade policy against Berlin, is currently on his way to Washington. When he arrives in Washington, he will participate in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the U.S. Department of State regarding the lifting of the Berlin blockade. The newspaper said that Malinin's visit to Washington was under the pseudonym General Georgiev.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 18th] East Germans hope to resume trade with West Germany and are now urging the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin blockade. According to the Hamburg-based "World B" newspaper, which is sponsored by the British army, the former Soviet ambassador to Germany, Dekanozov, has been in Berlin for several days persuading the Soviet military authorities to accept his proposal to restore trade and transportation between the eastern and western occupation zones, and this matter is approaching a decisive stage. Dekanozov has a major task in the Soviet policy of occupying Germany.</p>
<p>According to Wilson, the economic advisor to U.S. military governor Clay, the Soviet zone's Economic Commission has informally notified Frankfurt German officials, asking them to work together to restore trade between East and West Germany. However, the U.S. side has not responded to this posture of the Soviet zone with action, because there can be no talk of restoring trade until the Berlin blockade has been completely lifted.</p>
<h3>U.S. Plans to Change Relations with Japan; Seems Intended to Implement an Agreement Similar to West Germany in Japan; Feels the Problem of Allied Control is Quite Tricky</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] American officials here said today that the complexity of the Allied occupation forces control system in Japan would hinder the Allies from reaching an agreement with Japan similar to the one recently concluded with West Germany. It also said that although the U.S. Department of State and the Department of the Army have advocated a similar movement in Japan in the past few months, the conclusion of this agreement would necessarily involve the dissolution of the Far Eastern Commission, including eleven countries, and the cancellation of the Moscow Agreement of 1945.</p>
<p>(The Far Eastern Commission of Eleven Countries was established according to this agreement. The Commission has the right to decide on the general occupation policy towards Japan, and it also stipulates that the Soviet Union has a veto power in the Far Eastern Commission. Although the United States does not need to consult the Far Eastern Commission on certain urgent issues and has the power to instruct MacArthur to handle them, only the Far Eastern Commission has the right to change the regulations for the occupation of Japan or to modify the organization of the occupation authorities.) Diplomatic circles believe that this situation, such as the United States wants to change its relationship with Japan as it did with Germany, in order to open the door to a future peace treaty with Japan, there are the following three ways: (1) The United States obtains the consent of the other ten countries of the Far Eastern Commission, including the Soviet Union; (2) The United States avoids the Far Eastern Commission and gradually achieves an invisible change in its relationship with Japan; (3) Appeals to other Pacific countries to take action regardless of Soviet opposition. It is also pointed out in diplomatic circles here that, although the Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission, Pan Youxin, has repeatedly attacked the U.S. Department of State's policy of occupying Japan, taking the second of the above methods, there is still no indication to date that the United States is now prepared to put any of the above three methods into practice.</p>

<h3>Along the West German-Czech Border, US Troops Conduct Offensive and Defensive Exercises; Deploy Zoda Network to Detect Enemy Air Raids</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Nuremberg, 18th] 7,088 US troops advanced towards the Czech border for spring exercises, confronting a hypothetical "aggressor" gathering in the east. "Aggressor" is the standard military term for the enemy during exercises. During the last war, Hitler divided his troops into three routes to invade Czechoslovakia. Two brigades of US tank forces are now rapidly approaching the Czech border along the southern route. The First Infantry Division followed closely behind the tanks, intending to resist the "aggressor" who will attack from Czechoslovakia on the 19th. Fighter groups, including jet aircraft, were ordered to take off from permanent bases near Munich and quickly fly to the previously abandoned former German airfields. The heavily guarded "living eyes" also scanned the east with radar, detecting incoming enemy aircraft. In fact, all US troops stationed in Germany have been dispatched from Bremerhaven. The military is now seeking to answer a question: can the United States completely supply the US occupying forces on the battlefield only from the US-occupied zone in Germany? Senior staff officers have stated that communist revolts in other ports in Western Europe could easily disrupt supplies during the most critical days, let alone during a conflict.</p>

<h3>History of Southern Ireland's Struggle for Independence; Finally Achieves Its Wish to Break Away from British Rule</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Starting at 00:01 this morning, Ireland has freed itself from centuries-old ties with the British monarch and declared itself the Republic of Ireland outside the British Commonwealth, bringing a new stage to the long political struggle between Ireland and Britain. The first batch of British people to set foot on Irish soil were Norman adventurers from South Wales who invaded Ireland in 1167 AD.</p>
<p>By the end of the Middle Ages, the English immigrants gradually tended to unite. By 1607, Ulster was densely populated with immigrants from England and Scotland, which still retains a majority advantage today. The Act of Union in 1800 meant that Ireland was no longer regarded as another kingdom. Ireland gained one hundred seats in the British House of Commons and thirty-four seats in the House of Lords, but soon after, the struggle to break away from British rule immediately began. British Liberal Prime Minister Gladstone attempted twice in the late 19th century to propose a bill granting Ireland Home Rule, but both failed. Prime Minister Asquith tried again in 1921, but it also failed. However, the people of Ulster were determined and formed the Ulster Volunteer Force to realize their demands. The outbreak of the First European War temporarily shelved this plan, but in 1916, the "Irish Republican Army" then announced the establishment of the Irish Republic, but it did not last long. Within a week, the British forcibly suppressed the rise of the Irish, and sixteen revolutionary leaders were executed by British military tribunals by firing squad, and more than a thousand people were exiled abroad. During the European War, the Irish members of the House of Commons agreed not to raise the issue of autonomy during the war, but a Fale Oireachtas Unity Party emerged in Southern Ireland, launching a difficult political struggle. However, in 1921, the Irish people finally signed a treaty with Britain, allowing Ireland to obtain the status of a dominion, but the Irish riots did not end there. Irish people who opposed and supported this treaty fought each other endlessly, until it ended in 1924. The constitution of 1922 stipulated the establishment of a Senate and a House of Representatives. The first government was formed under the leadership of Cosgrave. De Valera initially refused to participate in parliament because he was unwilling to swear allegiance to the British monarch, but soon agreed to join. In 1931, De Valera jumped from the opposition party to become the leader of the ruling party, which he retained until last year. Last year, Costello organized a coalition government, whose first action was to break away from Ireland's ties with the British Commonwealth, and it has now achieved its wish. However, the Irish have not given up the demand to end the division between Northern and Southern Ireland. They believe that the Irish struggle for independence has not been completed until Northern Ireland is merged with Southern Ireland.</p>
<p>Britain's Status is Not Weakened</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 18th] New York newspapers prominently published the news of the independence of the Republic of Ireland and published commentaries. The newspapers generally believe that Ireland's independence does not weaken Britain's status. On the contrary, based on the treaties to be concluded between Britain and Ireland in the future, it can better help Britain's strategic position. Ireland has long been equal to independence politically and practically. Now that it has formally broken away from the British Commonwealth, it can eliminate the suspicion between Britain and Ireland and move towards genuine cooperation.</p>
<p>Leaders of Various Countries Send Congratulatory Telegrams</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] King George VI of England recently sent a telegram to Irish President O'Kelly, congratulating the establishment of the Republic of Ireland. The telegram specifically mentioned the achievements of the Irish people in assisting the Allied forces in defeating the enemy during the Second World War, and wished the Republic of Ireland a prosperous future and national fortune. President Truman's congratulatory telegram to President O'Kelly stated that he, on behalf of the American people and government, congratulated the Irish people on their future happiness and prosperity. Prime Minister Attlee, Pope Pius XII, South African Prime Minister Malan, New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, Canadian Prime Minister Laurent, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Italian President Einaudi, and Burmese President Sao Shwe Thaik all sent similar congratulatory telegrams to President O'Kelly.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Convened Meeting of Relevant Groups Yesterday; Decided to Adopt a Weekly Salary System; Publish Index Weekly; Discuss Today at the Index Compilation Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The living cost index salary system has aroused extreme dissatisfaction among workers. Because prices have risen wildly recently, rising by an average of 20% to 30% every day, and the living cost index is published every half month, it already feels like a slow remedy. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau invited relevant groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Industrial Association, and the Workers' Welfare Association to discuss this issue. Lu Jingshi, Yan E'sheng, Tian Heqing, Pan Shihao, Hong Nianzu, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Fan Cai, and Shen Ding and others attended. Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau chaired the meeting. Two opposing opinions arose during the meeting. One faction believed that the living cost index can no longer adapt to the current daily price increases and advocated that it should be abolished and replaced with silver dollars or rice as the basis for salaries. The other faction believed that the living cost index salary system is still a scientific method. The recent depreciation of gold yuan and soaring prices have many reasons, but the blame does not lie with the living cost index, and it can be improved instead of being abolished rashly. Therefore, there were three opinions at the meeting: (1) Improve the twice-monthly living cost index salary system to a weekly salary system, that is, publish the living cost index once a week and pay salaries once a week. (2) Calculate salaries in gold yuan converted from Yuan head silver dollars. According to the method when the currency system was reformed, 2 gold yuan can be exchanged for 1 silver dollar. For example, a base salary of 100 yuan would mean paying 50 Yuan head silver dollars per month. (3) Calculate salaries in rice. When the currency system was reformed, the price of rice was 20 gold yuan per stone. For example, a base salary of 100 yuan would mean paying 5 stones of rice per month, and then converting it into gold yuan based on the market price of the day for salary payment. After detailed discussion at the meeting, most people still advocated adopting a weekly salary system, and the resolution method is as follows: (1) Improve the living cost index to be published once a week, (2) The index should be published every Wednesday morning, (3) The seven days' salary from last Thursday to this Wednesday must be paid off every Thursday, and it must not be delayed for more than two days. If it is overdue, compensation for workers' losses will be made according to the daily interest rate announced by the Central Bank. (4) Piecework and daily wage workers will close their accounts early on Tuesday or Wednesday. If calculation difficulties arise, they will be calculated according to the base salary earned by each worker last week. The Social Affairs Bureau will submit the above resolution to today's municipal government's Living Cost Index Compilation Review Committee for discussion. It will also be studied at the Labor-Management Assessment Committee to be convened tomorrow to see if there are any problems for the employer with paying salaries weekly and not delaying payment for more than two days after the weekly index is published. After they are all passed, they will be submitted to the municipal government meeting for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Workers' Lives Threatened; General Labor Union to Discuss Countermeasures Today</h3>
<p>The unprecedented soaring of prices for several consecutive days is an even greater threat to workers' lives. According to the person in charge of the Municipal General Labor Union, who told reporters yesterday: As the leading organization for 800,000 workers in the city, the union is very concerned about this serious issue. An emergency standing council meeting will be convened at the union at 4:00 PM today to specifically discuss this issue. In addition to requesting the government to thoroughly and strictly control prices, it will also request the Social Affairs Bureau to advance 50% of the wages of workers in each factory to avoid the impact of devaluation due to severe price fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Vice Minister of Finance Yang Zhuoan Answers Questions on Finance, Food, and Other Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yang Zhuoan, Director of the Emergency Food Procurement and Storage Committee, was recently appointed by the government as Permanent Vice Minister of Finance. He officially assumed office yesterday and is stationed in Shanghai for office work. The reporter made a special visit yesterday to inquire about various current financial and food issues. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Q: What is the central task of the Ministry of Finance at present?</p>
<p>A: At present, the fierce fluctuations in prices have greatly affected people's livelihood. How to stabilize the currency value and stabilize finance should be the central task of the Ministry of Finance. The government is actively planning specific methods, and I, as the permanent vice minister, will only follow the government's decisions.</p>
<p>Q: What is the current situation of food sources?</p>
<p>A: For the past six months, we have been planning food sources and funds in extremely difficult circumstances. Since the establishment of the Food Storage Committee, there has never been a fixed budget for food funds, relying purely on temporary fundraising; even if there is a fixed budget, it is equivalent to nothing under the circumstances of continuous price increases. Fortunately, with the full assistance of all parties, the food sources allocated to each department were finally able to reach 60% of the predetermined amount, coupled with 40% of US food, to complete the task of supplying two-thirds of the people's food. There is no problem with Shanghai's household food quota before the end of June. After July, we have already started planning.</p>
<p>Q: How is the process of Shanghai exchanging wheat flour for coal from North China progressing?</p>
<p>A: Because Shanghai is short of coal, the severity is far above food. The Central Bank and the Municipal Government initially believed that it was necessary to exchange coal, so the Food Storage Committee supplied 300,000 bags of wheat flour and entrusted the China Trust Bureau to purchase 15,000 tons of Canadian wheat, which was also allocated for coal exchange. Although the committee has spent a lot of effort in raising food sources, in order to take care of the more urgent needs of the local area, it provided assistance regardless of everything.</p>
<p>Q: Someone accused you of corruption in purchasing food when you were in the Northeast Materials Adjustment Committee. What is the truth of this matter?</p>
<p>A: This matter is still under investigation by the court. The purchase of food was carried out under orders, and everything was approved by the Northeast Headquarters and the Ministry of Food. The food funds were directly remitted by the Central Bank to the governments of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, and the provincial governments designated agencies to handle it. The purchased food was handed over to the China Trust Bureau for collection and transportation. I did not handle any money or materials. Even if there are problems, it has nothing to do with me. Fortunately, the court attaches great importance to this matter, and it will not be difficult to find out the truth.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Obtains Preliminary Resolution on Cost-Based Pricing of Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday invited the Garrison Command, the Police Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Industrial Association, the China Textile Corporation, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, and the Coal Adjustment Office to discuss the issue of cost-based pricing of daily necessities. As a result, no concrete decision was made. The Industrial Association hopes that cost-based pricing can take into account the reproduction of factories, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce hopes that cost-based pricing can take into account the restocking of stores. After consultation, a preliminary resolution was made and will be submitted to the Economic Conference convened by the municipal government today for review.</p>
<h3>Economic Meals Rise in Price Again; Now Sold for 40,000 Yuan per Meal</h3>
<p>In the midst of the announcement of the living cost index and soaring prices, the economic meals, which were just adjusted on the 16th, were adjusted again yesterday, with the selling price rising to 40,000 yuan per meal. All public employees and salaried workers are extremely anxious about this.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Sells Materials by Tender; Few People Inquire Due to Turbulent Situation</h3>
<p>The various woolen fabrics and sundries sold by tender by the Government Materials Sales Committee of the Central Trust Bureau have received little attention. Only one or two people bid for each item, and their bids are often lower than the reserve price, so it is often impossible to sell them. According to the bureau's analysis of the reasons, all of this is because, in the turbulent situation, merchants are unwilling to purchase because they have no definite guarantee.</p>

<h3>Evening Edition of the Freedom Forum Newspaper Suspends Publication and Dismisses Employees, Causing Disputes</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Chinese evening edition of the Freedom Forum in this city suddenly announced its suspension of publication and reorganization on the 13th of this month. The newspaper has neither dismissed nor terminated the employment of all employees, including editors, reporters, proofreaders, and laborers, nor has it indicated whether it will continue to retain them. The employees of the newspaper's editorial department, because the newspaper company treats employees' lives as a joke, negotiated with the company yesterday. The company's President Shu Quanbao only said: During the probation period, they can be dismissed unconditionally. The employees then sent representatives to the municipal government to meet with Secretary-General Chen to present that the president of the newspaper company had told his colleagues when it was founded that there would be no economic problems within three months. Secretary-General Chen expressed deep sympathy and immediately instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to handle it seriously.</p>
<h3>Sugar Ration for Workers This Month Set at Half a Catty per Person</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Social Affairs Bureau decided yesterday that the sugar ration for workers this month will be half a catty of sugar per worker's family member, starting from the 25th of this month and ending at the end of the month, at a price one-third cheaper than the market price.</p>
<h3>Two Rounds of Ships Bring Large Amounts of Mail; North-South Mail Service to be Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Will Resume After the Second Phase of Barter Contract is Signed</p>
<p>According to postal sources: Currently, north-south mail service relies solely on coal-carrying ships for transportation. After the first phase of the powdered coal barter contract signed by the China Trust Bureau and the Kailuan Coal Mine expires, there will be an interruption of ships going north for a period before the second phase of the contract is signed, and north-south mail service will also be temporarily suspended. The Tangshan ship arrived in Shanghai on the 16th, carrying 432 bags of mail. The Dasheng ship arrived in Shanghai on the 17th, carrying 241 bags of mail, mostly small packages. These two ships are transporting the last batch of Kailuan coal south under the first phase of the contract. As for using airmail, it is also because there are no scheduled flights, and it is only entrusted to personnel of the Peace Delegation to carry it on special planes, so the quantity is extremely small. The airmail sent by the Shanghai Post Office to the China Aviation Corporation's special plane No. 531 a few days ago has not yet flown out.</p>
<h3>Tuberculosis Center Clinic Actively Promotes Work</h3>

In order to review the past and develop future work, the clinic invited representatives of various groups entrusted to handle group tuberculosis prevention checkups to hold a symposium at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. They exchanged opinions on how to expand publicity and how to gather social and economic forces to actively promote tuberculosis prevention work. The situation was very enthusiastic, and the meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>During the Prosperous Season for Yellow Croaker Fish, Facilitate Customs Clearance Procedures as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>The yellow croaker fish, known as one of the four major fish runs, arrived in Wusong yesterday with four ships. This is the beginning of the official listing of yellow croaker fish this year. The Garrison Command previously stipulated that the entry and exit time for fishing boats was from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM in order to control ships. However, the entry and exit of fishing boats and fishing vessels must go through customs clearance procedures. The Shanghai Fisheries Association, considering that the fishing season is at its peak and there are many fishing boats, in order to save time and avoid rushing and affecting the entry and exit order, sent a letter to the Wusong Branch of the Jianghai Customs, requesting that it leave a part of its staff on duty from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day to designate the handling of entry and exit procedures for fishing boats, in order to maintain the livelihood of fishermen and promote service efficiency. It is reported that the staff of the Wusong Branch of the Customs has agreed to do so.</p>

<h3>Helping Needy Students; Solving Living Problems: Student Relief Committee Initiates Fundraising Campaign for Five Thousand Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the pervasive war and soaring prices, students are experiencing extreme difficulties in their lives, leading to school dropouts, illness, malnutrition, academic decline, and anxiety, among other serious issues. There are over 30,000 university students in the city, about one-third of whom come from remote provinces. Now, due to the interruption of their economic resources, they are living in extreme poverty. Furthermore, due to poor nutrition, many are suffering from the terrible disease of tuberculosis. The Shanghai Student Relief Committee, organized by the Shanghai YMCA and YWCA, has launched a fundraising campaign to help needy students solve their living problems, aiming to raise five thousand silver dollars. The fundraising period is set from April 24th to May 6th. A charity bazaar will be held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA from May 4th to 6th, along with a student life exhibition. The slogan for the fundraising is "The more talent we cultivate, the more construction power the country has!" The fundraising methods are as follows: (1) One Friend, One Dollar Movement: Anyone who donates one silver dollar at a time will be a "Friend of Students." Donors of ten silver dollars or more will be honorary "Friends of Students." The goal is 2,000 people. (2) Donate Items for Charity Bazaar: Donations of clothing, daily necessities, food, artwork, and any other items for the charity bazaar to be held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA from May 4th to 6th are welcome. The committee is also willing to help arrange direct delivery of large quantities of goods to schools for students to eat if desired. (3) Special Project Donations: (A) Tofu Supply Station: A donation of 500 silver dollars can maintain a tofu supply station that provides tofu for 3,000 students for half a year. (B) Pig Raising: A donation of 200 silver dollars can establish a pigsty at a school to raise ten piglets, which can continuously supply the student dining hall with food after half a year.</p>
<p>Negotiating with Cheng Chung Hospital to Treat Students with Tuberculosis</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Student Relief Committee, in order to enable needy students with tuberculosis who are enrolled in universities and colleges to have the opportunity to receive treatment, has recently obtained the support of the China International Relief Committee and the cooperation of Jiangwan Cheng Chung Hospital. Starting from the 20th of this month, Cheng Chung Hospital will allocate two additional wards specifically for the hospitalization and treatment of sick students referred by the Student Relief Committee. The initial quota is set at thirty students. In addition to being responsible for subsidizing all medical and hospitalization expenses for these thirty sick students, the Student Relief Committee will also regularly provide the sick students with various educational books, newspapers, magazines, and recreational equipment to adjust their lives while sick, so as to achieve spiritual treatment effects.</p>

The Shanghai Tuberculosis Center Clinic will cooperate in the medical care and treatment. The initial quota for this item is set at 120 students, with national universities having priority.</p>
<h3>Over Fifty Northern Students to Go to Hangzhou Today to Discuss Resumption of Studies</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yu Xiaoci, Deputy Leader of the Ministry of Education's Committee for Guiding the Resumption of Studies and Employment of Youth, has returned to the General Association in Hangzhou. The Jiangsu Guidance Office of the committee, located in Suzhou, remains in Suzhou and has not moved to Shanghai.

<h3>Representatives of Municipal Primary School Principals' Association to Petition the Municipal Education Bureau Today, Demanding Improved Treatment and Maintenance of Livelihood</h3>
<p>The Municipal Primary School Principals' Association held a members' meeting the day before yesterday. Due to heavy rain, it was changed to a discussion meeting, and it was decided that Hu Huai-tian, Wang Li-ben, Pan Jie-mei, and three other representatives from the welfare group would go to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Education Bureau at 10:00 AM today to request improved treatment in order to maintain teachers' livelihoods. The main points of the petition decided at the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The minimum living standards of teachers and staff should be maintained. 1. Previously unpaid rations in kind should be fully paid by the 25th of this month. 2. The in-kind rations for April should be cancelled and converted into silver dollars at market prices for prompt payment. 3. Employees' monthly salaries should be paid in full according to their base salary, without any deductions, and calculated according to the city's cost-of-living index, to be paid on the 1st and 16th of each month. 4. Please follow the precedent of paying employees of national colleges and universities in advance and pre-pay the salaries of teachers and staff for May, June, and July for three months. 5. Please pre-issue employee welfare rice for May, June, and July for three months to meet urgent needs. 6. The water and electricity subsidies for April should be paid before the 25th of this month and then paid by the 5th of each month thereafter. (2) For principals of schools in the Pudong district traveling back and forth across the river, please issue free ferry passes as usual as a gesture of preferential treatment. (3) School building rents should be based on the schools' requests, whether calculated in terms of rice prices or the cost-of-living index, verified and released early. (4) Requests for temporary fees from various schools should be promptly investigated and verified for release, and there should be no bureaucratic delays that hinder progress and cause devaluation losses. (5) School operating expenses are far from sufficient. Please adjust them to a base of 20 yuan per person per month and issue them at the same time as employees' salaries according to the cost-of-living index.</p>
<p>[Additional Report] The Municipal Primary School Principals' Association has decided to adopt a postal voting method for the re-election of the current board of directors and supervisors. The voting ballots for each member will be issued immediately and will be counted by the supervisors at the No. 1 Center in the Fifth District of Yingshi Road on the 24th of this month (Sunday), it is said.</p>
<h3>First Spring Art Exhibition; Displayed Works Give a Fresh Impression; Outstanding Young Artists to Be Awarded Certificates by the Education Bureau</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, this reporter walked to the French Association on Nanchang Road, behind the Fuxing Park, to visit the First Spring Art Exhibition organized by the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Art Museum. In fact, Shanghai has held many art exhibitions in the past, but this one is labeled as the "First" because its exhibition style is said to adopt the "Salon" method of the spring and autumn seasons in Paris, France, to encourage young artists and improve the level of art. This type of art exhibition is the first of its kind in Shanghai, and has therefore attracted close attention from the cultural community.</p>
<p>The First Art Exhibition opened on the 15th of this month and is scheduled to last for nine days, closing on the 23rd. It includes over 400 works from various departments of the visual arts. Among the works, traditional Chinese paintings are still the most numerous, which is an inevitable phenomenon. Based on the characteristics of national traditions and the convenience of Chinese painting tools and materials, works are naturally easy to produce. The distinction between good and bad Chinese paintings lies in whether the painter can express a new spirit and a new look in the work. In this exhibition, many famous painters have participated with fresh works, such as Chen Zhifo, Liu Haisu, and Zhang Shulv's flower and bird paintings, Qi Baishi's figure paintings, and Xiao Quan and Wu Hufan's blue and green landscapes, all of which give visitors a fresh impression. However, it cannot be said that a change of subject matter is necessarily superior. There are many works here that still express infinite new interests in the old style, such as Zheng Wuchang, Tang Yun, Yu Shaosong, Zhang Zhongyuan, Wang Geyi, and Zhu Meicun, whose skills and interests all show a sense of courage and progress. In addition, young artists such as Fang Xutong and Huang Zhenglun can also be given great hope.</p>
<p>Relief Carving and Ivory Carving Worth Promoting: In addition to Chinese paintings, Western paintings, oil paintings, and watercolors are about half and half, among which most are entries by young artists in the competition. In general, they are all very meticulous and conscientious, and the paintings are very particular, which is an advantage. The general shortcoming is that the influence of Western color printing is too great. Since there are many differences between the original and the printed matter, if scholars exaggerate further, many drawbacks will arise and the main points of natural beauty will be lost. In this exhibition, there are works by Yan Wenliang, Fang Junbi, and Ma Xuncao, whose rich experience gained from painstakingly depicting nature is worth observing and referencing.</p>
<p>In addition to paintings, there are round carvings and reliefs by Hua Tianyou, Teng Baishi, and Liu Kaiqu, as well as ivory carvings by Zhou Xianchu. Although the quantity is small, they are very exquisite and worth promoting. It is hoped that artists will cheer up and work hard to create, so that the quantity of finished products in the next exhibition can be comparable to that of paintings.</p>
<p>Hoping to Create a Glorious Page: The First Spring Art Exhibition, after the hard work of Shi Chongpeng, director of the Art Museum Preparatory Office, and others, was finally opened at a time when the situation and public sentiment were extremely turbulent. This is a miracle, and their contributions cannot be erased. On the other hand, it is also sufficient to reflect the Chinese people's love of art. The art world does not succumb to troubled times. On the contrary, times of hardship can produce brand new masterpieces, which is a common occurrence in art history.</p>
<p>Conservatism is enough to hinder progress, and the art world is certainly no exception. This Spring Art Exhibition aims to discover new young artists. After strict criticism of the displayed works, those deemed to have outstanding achievements will be awarded certificates by the Education Bureau to encourage them, the significance of which is very profound. It is hoped that young artists can take this as the starting point of a milestone, move forward without limits, and create a more glorious page for the history of Chinese art. The First Spring Art Exhibition is rich in educational meaning, and this reporter is introducing it with special solemnity.</p>
<h3>Qualifications for Navigating Ships: Shipping Association Resolves Three Points; Those Originally Sailing the Northern Routes Should Have Priority for Going North</h3>
<p>The North-South Navigation Group of the Shipping Association held a meeting on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss the qualifications that ships going north should possess. Shen Qi, Li Yunliang, Zhong Shandao, Dong Haoyun, and others attended. Three key points were resolved: (1) Business Standard: If the ships of various shipping companies have always sailed the northern routes, then those ships should have priority for navigating north. (2) Performance Standard: The performance of ships going north should have a draft of no more than 15 feet and a hull length of 300 feet. These types of ships have priority to participate in navigation. The next priority are ships with a draft of more than 18 feet and a hull length of more than 300 feet. (3) Request Government Approval: If the ships of a shipping company that have been approved to participate in navigation encounter major accidents such as annual repairs that make them unable to sail, other ships that meet the standards may be dispatched to replace them. The replacement ship does not need to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval again. It only needs to be reported to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the Shanghai Customs for record before the replacement ship raises anchor.</p>
<h3>Accused of Extortion in German Doctor Case; Baden and Others Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] German overseas doctor, Stoller, accused former Municipal Police Bureau Foreign Affairs police officers Baden, Grassiner, and Soviet real estate developer Van Xue Lieff of colluding to threaten and extort him. The District Court has concluded its trial after several hearings, and yesterday announced that due to insufficient evidence, all three defendants were declared not guilty.</p>
<h3>The Northeast Behind the "Oriental Iron Curtain"</h3>
<p>(Continued from page two) In early February, the Communist government ordered all residents of South Jiutiao and South Batiao in Shenyang to move out, reportedly to provide housing for Soviet troops. The presence of Soviet Railway Protection Police along the Chinese Changchun Railway, and Soviet engineers repairing the Dalinghe Railway Bridge, were all witnessed by those on the scene. The rapid increase in the number of Soviet overseas residents in Shenyang is also noteworthy. Particularly noteworthy is the relationship between the Communist government of Dalian and the Northeast Administrative Committee (the highest administrative body of the Communist Northeast). Personnel from the publicly-owned production organizations of the Communist Northeast, holding travel permits to travel to Pulandian in order to enter Dalian were turned back by Soviet troops and not allowed to enter. On one occasion, Mr. Zhou Zhenhao accompanied two Korean merchants attempting to travel to Hainan via Dalian, and was also stopped at Pulandian, while the Koreans were allowed to pass. From this, the relationship and nature of the Northeast Administrative Committee and the Communist Democratic Government of Dalian can be seen. The impression of the Soviet troops obtained is different from those previously seen in Shenyang and Changchun. They are cold and stern, and not moved by watches, pens, or money. Dalian is clearly within the scope of a Soviet-style iron curtain.</p>
<p>As for the large-scale dismantling and transportation of machinery and materials by the Soviet army in the Northeast, the explanation of Huang Qizhi, deputy manager of the Northeast Bank, is: "Suppose my home is occupied by thieves, and now a neighbor drives them away for me, and takes away a chopstick and a bowl, what attitude should I take?" This popular explanation is overly forced, but there seems to be no better public explanation besides this. It can be proven that the Soviet Union has no possibility of returning the dismantled machinery to the Northeast.</p>
<p>A week after the Communist army entered Shenyang, Mayor Zhu Qiwen convened a meeting of consuls from various countries stationed in Shenyang and announced three handling steps: (1) Confiscate radios, (2) Stop the supply of water and electricity, and (3) Request to leave the country. According to Zhou's eyewitness account, in early February, the British Consulate on Erwei Road was still surrounded and guarded by the Communist army, cutting off traffic, just like a plague-stricken area.</p>
<p>Daily necessities in Shenyang, such as matches and soap, are of extremely poor quality. Soap is reddish-brown and black. Caustic soda, bleaching powder, and industrial fats are extremely lacking. The matches used in Shenyang all come from Andong, which is produced by the Andong Match Factory that the Communist Andong Radio has always promoted. The matchsticks are uneven in thickness, and the black medicine on the head varies in amount. Less than half of each box can be used. This shows that the matchstick cutting machine lacks repair parts, and at the same time lacks refined ordinary chemical raw materials.</p>
<p>Residents of Shenyang without household registration are called "black people," suspected of counter-revolution, and their situation is extremely dangerous. The Communist Party has always believed that it has failed to capture personnel from the Central Unification Bureau and the Military Unification Bureau. According to a Shenyang newspaper in February, a certain Red Army cadre (who participated in the 25,000-mile Long March) was sentenced to death for releasing a Central Unification Bureau personnel after accepting a bribe of twenty taels of gold. Shenyang has not carried out large-scale arrests, but residents are ultimately not allowed to leave more than 120 li outside the city after signing for travel permits, so it is equivalent to a complete detention. It is not as free as moving in and out of Peiping. It is naturally not easy to predict what the future situation of Peiping will be. However, comparing the current situation of Peiping and Tianjin with Shenyang, the people's freedom of life is one in the depths of the earth and the other in the clouds. In Shenyang, if you stay overnight at a friend's house, you must report to the Public Security Bureau. You cannot talk for long when visiting friends, the content of the conversation will be investigated, and you cannot whisper, otherwise the Communist Party members will open their suspicious eyes, revealing a nervous glimmer, and ask questions, but the whispers of party members are not subject to this restriction, as if it were a privilege they could be proud of. The food situation at home is also the subject of investigation. If the diet is better, their economic sources will be questioned. The three key points of the personal investigation in the Baojia organization are: (1) The economic source for maintaining life, (2) Friends' contacts and the content of their conversations, and (3) Why they have not worked in the democratic government system. Donations are not called "donations," but "voluntary contributions." The Communist Party believes that "apportioned donations" are a product of the Kuomintang. The Communist Party only has "voluntary contributions," but in reality, it is still a "donation," which is the so-called style of "wanting to have an affair but also wanting to erect a chastity arch."</p>
<p>Shenyang's commerce is declining, and merchants have the slogan "sell it all, eat it all." Taxes are extremely heavy, and purchasing power has collapsed. Except for grain and gold, which are relatively stable in price, nothing else is cheap. For example, tax tickets such as liquor tax have a time limit of one month. If they cannot be sold after one month, another tax will be levied, to infinity. This method is called liquor monopoly and does not exist in other parts of the Northeast except Liaoning Province. Zhang Xueshi, chairman of Liaoning Province, has great military and political power. What is not stipulated by the highest institution, the Northeast Administrative Committee, Zhang Xueshi has his own unilateral measures. He is actively recruiting old subordinates of Zhang Zuolin, but none of Zhang Zuolin's old people have responded. On the contrary, they advised Zhang Xueshi not to do it. Another Northeast cadre, Lü Zhengcao, has been relieved of his military duties and appointed Minister of Railways of the Administrative Committee. He seems to be frustrated.</p>
<p>The former chiefs of the various offices of the Northeast Suppression Headquarters are still in Shenyang. Zhou Fucheng is also there, Zhang Baochi is in Harbin, and Zheng Dongguo is freer in Harbin, and is not treated the same as other captured military officers. People from Harbin said that Zheng often appears on the streets in a car.</p>
<h3>Batch of Political Prisoners to Be Released on Bail Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our City] The City Prosecutor's Office was ordered to handle the issue of releasing political prisoners on bail. Chen Shoutao and Wang Daozhou, two prosecutors, and Zhong Xianda and Zhu Yuhuang, two court workers from the District Court, conducted a joint review at Shanghai Prison the day before yesterday. After a meeting to discuss the results yesterday morning, the office decided to release twenty political prisoners on bail today. Those who met the political prisoner release regulations included Hua Defang, Lu Zicheng, Gong Shaomin, Chen Zemin, Jiang Haiqiu, He Zhongwen, Wang Zhongyi, Zhou Yunlong, Fang Shenghong, Luo Zhizhong, Tang Xinyu, Gong Boder, Yu Chengxin, Yao Haigen, Wang Mingyuan, Yang Guangming, Su Fukang, and Zhang Zhiming. Zhou Jinlong and Yang Changmin were not purely political prisoners but met the ordinary bail methods (the above twenty people were sentenced by the former Special Criminal Court and detained in Shanghai Prison). In addition, there were Qiu Yiqing, Feng Mingliang, Ying Zhenzhong, Xu Zhenyuan, Gu Sanmao, Wang Qiuping, Zhu Fusheng, Shen Pengjie, Yu Qinxue, Xu Kuijun, Wang Changming, and Zhang Qingde, who were detained in the prison. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters was asked to investigate and release them. Furthermore, Zhang Nianen, Huang Ganren, Yu Defu, and Fu Jiajun were temporarily not allowed to be released on bail because they violated the Emergency Crime Punishment Act Endangering the Nation and committed murder. Their cases will be submitted to higher authorities for decision.</p>
<p>[Additional Report] The District Prosecutor's Office sent letters to relevant parties last week requesting investigation and release of detained political prisoners, but no response has been received as of yesterday. However, over twenty cases of applications for bail have been received by the office yesterday, including over forty detained political prisoners. The office is currently verifying with the relevant parties.</p>
<h3>Secretly Selling Guns; Five Criminals Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The police received a report that travelers Gong Yayu and Li Gensan were secretly selling handguns in Room 303 of the Renhe Inn on Yunnan South Road. They dispatched officers to search the room and seized a Browning pistol and four bullets. In addition to the criminals Gong and Li, Zhao Ziquan, who was impersonating an inspector from the Garrison Headquarters, was also arrested on the spot. After interrogation at the police station, the facts were confirmed, and all were transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for handling yesterday.

<p>General Labor Union News: Jin Zhixian, the owner of a rickshaw, in the midst of soaring prices, actually intends to calculate the rickshaw rent in rice, stipulating six liters of white rice per day, to be paid according to the market price of the day.

<h3>Guangci Orphanage Hopes for Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Guangci Orphanage was founded in the seventh year of the Republic of China. The orphanage is located in Minhang Town, Shanghai County, with 45 acres of land and over 160 orphanage buildings. Over 1,200 orphans have been cultivated over the past 30 years. When the August 13th Shanghai Battle broke out, all the buildings and equipment in the orphanage were destroyed. It then moved to Shanghai. After the victory, with the assistance of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, 11 simple orphanage bungalows were built on the original site, and it moved back to continue its educational work. Because of the lack of land rent income and few donations, it currently only accommodates over 50 orphans. However, with soaring prices and huge expenditures, even the education of these dozens of orphans is in danger of running out of food from time to time. It urgently hopes that all sectors will donate generously so that the educational work can continue.</p>

<h3>Residents of Huoshan Road Robbed, Robbers Open Fire and Injure Young Woman</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At approximately 8:30 PM last night, four robbers broke into the home of a certain family at 1115 Huoshan Road in eastern Shanghai. Two of the robbers carried firearms and warned them not to make a sound. The robbers then searched the house and stole gold, silver jewelry, and clothing. When the homeowner subsequently cried out loudly, the robbers became enraged and fired a shot in retaliation. A stray bullet struck Dai Li (24 years old), a young woman, in the face, and she fell to the ground. Shortly after, the Yulin Road Police Precinct received a report and dispatched a large number of officers to search for the robbers, but they had already fled. The wounded woman was taken to the Hudong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Water Inspection Station Police Officer Accused of Corruption, Trial Begins</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhou Xiulu, a native of Chaozhou, came to Shanghai from Shantou on the China Merchants Bureau's Haihang ship in January of this year, carrying sixteen gold bars from Hong Kong, each weighing six ounces, totaling ninety-six ounces. After the ship arrived at port on January 13th, Zhou, being new to Shanghai and aware of the many criminals at the Shanghai docks, entrusted Fu Arong, a third-class steward on the ship, to carry the gold ashore. Unexpectedly, as Fu was carrying the gold and intending to hire a sampan to go around the long way, he was spotted by Shen Long, Li Yiren, and Chen Liangcai, volunteer inspectors from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters' Water Inspection Station, and Zhu Bomao, a police officer from the Security Police Brigade. Seeing that he was in a hurry, they immediately ordered him to be inspected. Fu then returned to the ship and requested to return to the cabin for inspection. The gold bars were then seized. Shen and the others, blinded by greed, threatened him with charges of smuggling gold and disrupting the financial order, intending to confiscate all of it and pocket it for themselves. After Fu pleaded bitterly, they returned six bars and took ten bars. They then found forty silver dollars in Fu's drawer in the cabin, issued a receipt, and told him to contact the Water Inspection Station to claim them, but did not specify the number of gold bars confiscated. Afterwards, Fu truthfully told Zhou, who then reported the matter to the Water Unified Inspection Team of the Garrison Headquarters, who arrested Shen and the other three. Fearing that Fu had swallowed the gold in private and made false accusations, they were also detained together. After investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office, Shen and the others were prosecuted on charges of corruption. Yesterday morning, the District Court, presided over by Judge Meng Tingke, heard the case and questioned Fu in detail. The defendants only admitted to taking forty silver dollars and denied confiscating the gold bars. The plaintiff, however, recounted the details of the extortion in court, and filed an incidental civil suit, demanding that the court order the return of sixty ounces of gold. As the case still needed further investigation, the hearing was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Murder for Money, Russian Woman's Bloody Case in Qingdao, Solved in Less Than Sixty Hours</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Lei Ming</p>
<p>[Our Report from Qingdao, 13th by Airmail] The Qingdao City Police Department today solved a case of a Soviet man robbing and murdering a Russian woman. The circumstances of the murder were extremely brutal. The case was discovered at 9:00 PM on the 10th. From the on-site investigation, situation assessment, case pursuit, to the arrest of the murderer and the search for stolen goods and weapons, the entire case was solved in less than sixty hours. The entire case was based on physical evidence, not relying on confessions. It should be a model case in police investigation. The speed and smoothness of the case's resolution can be attributed to extensive preliminary investigation and preparation work. Liu Guozhu, the director of the City Police Department, personally supervised the police officers and deployed them day and night, which greatly contributed to the capture of the murderer before he could escape to Shanghai and solve the case.</p>
<p>Husband Returns Home, Wife Murdered</p>
<p>The discovery of the case is as follows:</p>
<p>At approximately 9:00 PM on the 10th, the Russian musician Ba Qianzao (50 years old), residing at 8 Zhanshan Third Road, returned home after finishing work in the city and discovered that his wife (45 years old), Ao Wugusi Zhi Ba Qianzao, had been murdered in their private residence and their property had been stolen. The elderly couple, Ba Qianzao and his wife, had been married for many years and had lived there for a long time, without any children. Ba Qianzao immediately reported the incident to the South Branch Police Station. Upon learning of the incident, Director Liu Guozhu, Deputy Director Ma Xiang, Criminal Police Captain Chen Hongju, and others immediately rushed to the scene to investigate and completed the investigation at 4:00 AM the next day. The investigation work included taking photos, taking fingerprints, observing and recording the scene, registering the lost property, and interviewing nearby neighbors.</p>
<p>Hands Tied Behind Back, Upper Body Prostrate</p>
<p>The murdered Russian woman's hands were tied behind her back with window curtains, and her head and neck were also tied with window curtains. Her head was struck with an iron instrument in nine places, two of which were struck with a pistol butt. Her face was covered in blood. Her upper body was prostrate on a sofa bed placed in the corner of the wall, her knees were kneeling in front of the bed, and blood was splattered all over the wall. The scene was extremely tragic. The murder site was the room on the right upstairs. The cabinets and boxes in the downstairs bedroom were ransacked, and clothes and supplies were scattered. Items that ordinary people would consider valuable embroidery and utensils were not lost. Only 60 US dollars, a fox fur coat (worth 500 US dollars), a yellow coat, a navy blue suit, and some gold-plated jewelry were lost, including a gold cross, leaving only the base, and the cross had been pried off, worth about 1,000 US dollars in total. According to a white Russian woman neighbor: She went to the house at about 7:00 PM, intending to chat with the murdered woman (the two usually had a good relationship, and visited each other every day). She knocked on the door, but no one answered. She looked inside through the glass window and saw that the bedroom door was closed. She realized that she had heard the deceased say she felt slightly unwell during the day, and thought she might have fallen asleep. She came to visit at about 8:00 PM. When she knocked on the door, no one answered. Looking through the glass, she saw that the door was open and felt puzzled, never expecting that she had been murdered.</p>
<p>Scene Situation, Three Judgments</p>
<p>Based on the various situations at the scene, Director Liu Guozhu remained silent for half an hour, then made three judgments and instructed his subordinates to solve the case within a time limit.</p>
<p>(1) This case is a murder for money, with no political motives, nor is it a revenge killing or a love killing. The incident occurred between 5:00 and 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>(2) The murderer is a foreigner. (Chinese bandits usually only seek money and do not kill, and would not abandon items that are commonly considered valuable, nor would they pry off a cross). The method of binding is foreign. The brutality of the murder is Russian. Among the Soviet and White Russians, some people live in hardship, and other foreigners would not take such risks. It should be a Soviet or White Russian.</p>
<p>(3) The murderer may be familiar with the deceased, so he must kill to silence her. There is more than one murderer.</p>
<p>Investigative Scope Quickly Narrowed</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the foreign resident registration form, eight Soviet and Russian residents with bad behavior were immediately put on a blacklist. The murderers, Babunov and Isay, were actually listed as first and second. According to daily investigations, these two were originally well-known ruffians. As a result of the four-way investigation, the investigative scope was quickly narrowed by comparing the time of the incident with the people on the blacklist one by one. It was believed that Babunov and Isay were the most suspected, and a separate pursuit began.</p>
<p>Babunov (25 years old), a Soviet citizen, has no regular job and often resides in Chinese and foreign brothels. He usually resides at his girlfriend's house at 34 Zhengyangguan Road. On the night of the incident, he changed into a new set of clothes and resided at his girlfriend's house at 39 Rongcheng Road. He usually gets up at 11:00 AM, but the next day he got up very early, and tidied up his luggage, looking like he was leaving. Isay (19 years old), a Soviet citizen, his father has declared to the police that he has severed his father-son relationship. He is currently a waiter at the Zhongxing Bar and resides at his girlfriend's house at 7-4 Nanhai Road. He has not been to work at the bar since the night of the incident.</p>
<p>Two Criminals Captured, Confessed After One Interrogation</p>
<p>On the morning of the 13th, Dong Zuolin, a patrol officer from the Criminal Police Division of the South Branch Police Station, Police Chief Li Bin, and criminal police officers Wang Jingyan and Huang Jiashu, took photos of Ba and Yi and went to the Dongfang Market area on Longkou Road to search separately. They found Ba and Yi walking side by side out of the market. Criminal police officer Huang Jiashu went forward alone and captured Isay. Babunov escaped. Isay was brought to the police station for interrogation. Isay was still wearing the grassy green woolen coat and gray velvet trousers he was wearing when he committed the crime. There were 26 bloodstains on his upper body, which had been wiped, but were still visible. He initially hesitated, but the police station planned to chemically test the bloodstains on his clothes. He then revealed the truth and demonstrated the process of the murder. The police station believed that it was consistent with the results of the on-site investigation and provided the possible whereabouts of Babunov. At 1:30 PM, Babunov was captured at 34 Zhengyangguan Road. Ba was wearing the stolen navy blue suit and a stolen item was found. Isay's bloodstained trousers were found at a friend's house on Qidong Road, with 15 bloodstains on them. The iron bar used as a weapon was found in the soil in the racetrack. The stolen goods and evidence were complete. He confessed after one interrogation.</p>
<p>Lacking Money for the Festival, Intended to Commit a Crime</p>
<p>According to the confession, Babunov met Isay at the Dula Camp Bar on Guanxian Road in the spring of last year. They often visited each other afterwards. A week ago, the two met at the Sannada District's home on Rongcheng Road. Sa and his mistress were not at home. The two talked about the upcoming Easter on April 24th and needed money to celebrate the festival, so they had to use their brains. Three days later, they met at the Soviet Club. Ba said that the new house being built at 8 Zhanshan Third Road was the residence of Ba Qianzao, who works as a musician in various bars. Ba Qianzao must have money, so they planned to rob him. On the afternoon of the 5th, Yi borrowed a pistol with 52 bullets and handed it over to Babunov near the United Hotel. The next day, he fired a shot at the racetrack to check its effectiveness. It was also decided to do it on the 9th. On the 9th, Ba hid the gun and went alone, but saw a Chinese working in the yard and returned.</p>
<p>Pretended to Rent a House, Threatened with a Gun</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 10th, the two first met at the Zhanshan Haishan Bathing Beach. Ba, holding the gun, went first. Seeing that the room was quiet, he whistled to call Yi forward to knock on the door together. It was about 6:00 PM. When Ba Qianzao's wife opened the door, the two claimed that they wanted to rent a house. Ba's wife did not suspect anything and welcomed them in. When entering the room on the right upstairs, Babunov still said that he was willing to rent this house for one month for 10 US dollars a month. Before he finished speaking, he pointed the gun at Ba's wife, forbade her from making any noise, and said that if she took out the money, he would not hurt her, otherwise he would kill her. Ba's wife was shocked and wanted to shout, and said that she had no money. Ba quickly covered her mouth with his hand, and Yi tore off the window curtain to tie Ba's wife's hands and stuff her mouth, strangling her head. Ba first planned to wrap her head with a window curtain, and then put the gun into her mouth to shoot Ba's wife to death to reduce the volume, but ultimately found it inappropriate. He decided to use a pre-buried two-headed pointed iron bar, and Yi smashed her head to death. Babunov went downstairs to rob, and Yi still held the gun to guard Ba's wife.</p>
<p>Escape to Shanghai Failed, Murder Case Solved First</p>
<p>According to the murderer, when committing the crime, they heard someone knocking on the door outside, so the two hastily robbed and escaped from the kitchen to the back door. They did not expect to get only 60 US dollars, so they were very disappointed. Babunov sent two coats to the post office to be sent to Shanghai. The sender was "Bruguov, 34 Zhenghai Customs Road", and the recipient was "Bi Lov, French Concession, Shanghai." (The police station immediately filed a claim with the post office.) The two planned to escape to Shanghai first, and then to Yantai. If the investigation work was delayed by one day, the two murderers might have boarded a ship south on the 14th, making the complete resolution more difficult. It is still under study whether the entire case will be sent to the court or the garrison headquarters. Director Liu Guozhu rewarded the police officers, including South Branch Director Zang Maqi, for their quick case solving and outstanding efficiency. The police station has sent a letter to the Shanghai Police Department to assist in the investigation of Ba and Yi's suspected crimes in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>"Emperor's Tomb" Causes a Sensation in Yixing City, Preliminary Excavation Report of the Ancient Tomb in Gaocheng Town</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhu Xianggao</p>
<p>[Our Report from Yixing, 17th] There is a large tomb in the Dadaqiao area of the first Bao of Gaocheng Town, Heqiao District, this county, commonly known by the locals as the "Bao Emperor's Tomb." The reporter searched through the county annals of this county, but could not find any such record. However, the locals have recently been talking about it suspiciously, saying that they discovered a divine light emanating from the tomb at night, and that the tomb contains rare treasures. The rumors are diverse and the stories vary.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 13th, the farmers carried their farming tools to excavate this "Emperor's Tomb." After a day's effort, they only discovered the stone gate and stone threshold of the tomb. Now they have also made a big hole in this stone gate, because there is no sunlight entering inside, and it is pitch black. The villagers, who had seen little of the world, began to spread rumors that there was a magnificent building inside, with two iron coffins hanging on iron hooks. After the news spread, it caused a sensation far and wide. Residents from dozens of miles away also came to visit. The reporter, accompanied by Zhou Piyue, a director of the local Reporters Association, went to interview them.</p>
<p>The special car went directly to the Tianzhutang. Guided by the local guide, we walked two Huaili to the northwest. From dozens of feet away, we could see thousands of men, women, and children surrounding the mound, which was about two Zhang high. Three huge earth mounds were arranged in a character-shaped formation. A large area was planted with many tombs, trees, flowers, and plants, which appeared to be very old. The reporter first inspected the outside of the mound, front, back, left, and right, for half an hour, which shows the large scope of the tomb.</p>
<p>After asking an elderly farmer who was nearly 90 years old, it was said that the Bao Emperor's Tomb was likely a relic of the Jin Dynasty. As for the origin of the popular saying that the interior was the burial place of Bao Long, Bao Hu, and Bao Sanniang, there was no way to explore it. In the past, the local area was inhabited by descendants of the Bao family, but unfortunately, they have now disappeared, so there is no way to investigate it. As a result, the tomb has also lost its caretakers and has gradually fallen into disrepair.</p>
<p>The excavation site was in the southern mound. After a day's work, it has been dug down from the horizon to a depth of more than two people. Two white stone doors appeared in the depths of the tomb, about three feet and five inches long, one foot and five inches wide, and four inches thick. There were two stone thresholds, more than one foot thick, above and below the stone doors. The four sides were made of green ancient bricks, each of which was more than twice the size of a city brick and weighed more than thirty Jin. Because the volume was too bulky, there was no way to pick it up and hide it. The bricks were flat and intact, and there were no patterns or ancient characters on them, so there was no way to rub them for publication for archaeologists to study. According to a scholar in the village, he speculated that they were Han bricks, but in the reporter's opinion, they seemed more like Jin bricks, because the Yixing group was set up only during the Jin Dynasty. The tomb bricks piled on the ground are now being freely transported by the villagers, and the town office does not interfere. In fact, they do not know how much value they have. Only a few bookworms who were watching the excitement were shaking their heads and sighing. The villagers who were excavating were so enthusiastic that they thought that the self-defense team soldiers who were protecting the reporter were going to interfere, and they were so scared that they ran away. They probably thought that they would come to excavate again after we left. Therefore, the reporter repeatedly reminded the mayor of Gaocheng Town that if they were allowed to transport it naturally again, it was likely that the objects with archaeological value would be lost in a short period of time, and it was urgent to send someone to protect them and seal them up as soon as possible. Mayor Chen has already promised. The reporter and his party returned to the city today and heard that the local people have submitted a request to the government for protection and to order a special agency to formally excavate it. Once the government approves it, it can be formally excavated. It will be clear what was left behind, whose tomb it is, what is contained inside, and whether it has historical archaeological value.</p>
<p>On this trip, the reporter was given detailed instructions by Zhou Shouyue, the interviewing director of the Yongyan Newspaper. I hereby express my gratitude.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll</h3>
<p>— Watching the Guests</p>
<p>Yesterday the Central Bank Didn't Move; Today's Trend Will Be Nebulous</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market was filled with caution, so the morning was weak.</p>
<p>The Central Bank didn't take the bait immediately, so the sentiment changed, and the afternoon saw a recovery of lost ground, regaining interest, and then rising further. As long as this trend continues daily, it will be difficult for the Central Bank to "steal a chicken" (make a quick profit).</p>
<p>The payday period has passed, and the big spenders are now despondent. The bloodsucking friends have already left fully loaded, shifting their battlegrounds. What remains are the wage earners, who lose a few drops of their blood and sweat every time they spend a dollar.</p>
<p>This is the world of capitalism!</p>
<p>If you want to ask about conscience, you have to look for it in another world.</p>
<p>Today seems to be a turning point for the overall situation; market dynamics are bound to be nebulous and unpredictable.</p>
<p>Those who are astute should calmly observe the changing situation.</p>
<p>Those who are adept should find this a most interesting day.</p>
<p>General prices are still going crazy.</p>
<p>This is due to interest costs and the illusion created by the stock market's limit-up situation.</p>
<p>In fact, the stock market's limit-up, calculated according to the limits, is only about equal to the interest rate.</p>
<p>High interest rate policies have this benefit.</p>
<p>Market makers in the stock market have begun new activities.</p>
<p>Of course, given the overall situation and future card plays, new activities may be revised.</p>
<p>However, the possibility of no revision is currently equal to the possibility of revision.</p>
<p>The "selling" policy seems to have become the target of public criticism.</p>
<p>With Pei Tsu-yi's past experience as a lesson, Liu Gong-yun's courage is admirable.</p>
<p>A little over a month ago, some people expressed approval of Pei Tsu-yi's policies.</p>
<p>But Liu Gong-yun, who copied Pei's style, was "liquidated" after playing for a month. This seems contradictory, but it was actually expected.</p>
<p>In this society, people are only allowed to make excessive profits. Bearing the blame for artificially inflating prices is absolutely not allowed to hinder others' excessive profits or to attempt to control prices.</p>
<p>Since the Hong Kong authorities announced the gold ban, the Chinese community has been actively launching an offensive against the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p>Given the difference between the market price of gold in Hong Kong (320 HKD per ounce) and the theoretical official price (200 HKD per ounce), wealthy individuals are afraid of buying at a price that is too low and losing out, so they are currently adopting two major strategies to threaten the Hong Kong authorities:</p>
<p>(1) To promote in Guangzhou that large amounts of Hong Kong gold are being smuggled into Guangzhou, undermining the credibility of the Hong Kong customs' anti-smuggling efforts, so that the Hong Kong authorities will set a high purchase price.</p>
<p>(2) To sell off Hong Kong dollars in large quantities in Guangzhou, lowering the value of the Hong Kong dollar, in order to threaten the credibility of the Hong Kong dollar and create a de facto devaluation.</p>

<h3>Important Figure in Changzhou Grain Embezzlement Case: Former County Magistrate Weng Cheng Sentenced</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Wujin 17th dispatch] During his tenure, Weng Cheng, the former county magistrate of this county, had his confidant Lu Pinjin serve as secretary of the Grain Bureau and head of the Third Section. Lu Pinjin held excessive power and engaged in corruption and embezzlement in countless ways. Later, he colluded with Wu Shuchun, the director of the Caoqiao Office warehouse, and employees like Shou Xuefan and Sheng Rongxiang to transport tax grain to Wuxi for processing and profit. When the case was exposed, Lu Pinjin, Shou Xuefan, and others were arrested and imprisoned. At the time, Weng, in his capacity as county magistrate, provided much protection. In the end, he had them released on bail, conveniently allowing them to escape without a trace. The District Prosecutor's Office repeatedly summoned Weng to court for investigation. After a year, it was concluded that Weng Cheng was indeed suspected of the following four main points:</p>
<p>(1) Lu Pinjin and Shou Xuefan were Weng's henchmen, and Weng acted as a guarantor for Lu, leading to their escape.</p>
<p>(2) Lu Pinjin colluded with Wu Shuchun to transport tax grain to Wuxi for processing, embezzling more than 40 shi of rice. After the case was exposed, only Wu Shuchun was dismissed from his position, without further investigation.</p>
<p>(3) An investigation by the Grain Department revealed that Lu, Shou, and others converted surplus rice into 25 shi of rice and embezzled 30 million yuan, which was divided with Weng for their own use. They also altered the seven customs declarations without authorization, substituting粳 rice for 秈 rice, and dispatched Sheng Rongxiang, an employee of the Grain Bureau, to release Shou Xuefan during transport, allowing him to escape.</p>
<p>(4) The failure to handle the Lu-Shou case properly demonstrated collusion and conspiracy between superiors and subordinates. …Therefore, a public prosecution was filed with the criminal court. On the morning of the 15th, President Zhang of the District Court summoned Weng Cheng to court and invited Prosecutor Tao to conduct a public trial together.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, the court sentenced him to three years and six months of imprisonment, five years of public censure, and ordered the recovery of the price difference between 2,057 shi and 2 dou and 7 sheng of unprocessed粳 rice and 秈 rice. Weng Cheng was immediately taken into custody and sent to the detention center. Weng is a native of Zhejiang and has served as the county magistrate of Yongjia, Qingtian, and other counties. This imprisonment serves as a warning to corrupt officials, and it is unknown what Lu, Shou, and others who are still at large are thinking.</p>
<h3>Gold Found While Digging on University Hill in Zhenjiang: Ancient Burial Objects Divided Equally Among Seven Workers</h3>

<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
<p>Where is there help in need? Reader Mr. Su, 22 years old, from northern Jiangsu, with an elementary school education, worked in a small cloth factory, is extremely loyal and conscientious, and comes from an extraordinarily poor family. He recently lost his father and has an elderly mother in her seventies. Recently, he unfortunately became unemployed, and his clothing and food are threatened, causing him much grief. He is now urgently seeking employment, just like a dried fish waiting for water or a severe drought hoping for rain. He urgently needs benevolent, righteous, and enthusiastic compatriots with a spirit of human mutual aid and cooperation to sympathize and help him, arouse compassion, and bestow or introduce him to any job that provides food and lodging, in order to continue a glimmer of hope. Then, he will turn despair into life and will never be able to repay you. Please inform Zhu at No. 313, Damu Road, Shanghai (16).</p>

<h3>Price Limit Not Approved by Social Bureau, Rice Market Still Closed Yesterday, White粳 Sold for as High as 1.14 Million Yuan Off-Site</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] The Social Bureau stipulated yesterday that the price of rice should not exceed 1 million yuan per shi. The North City market did not open, and only 500 shi of low-quality rice were traded in the South City market, all below 1 million yuan per shi. Yesterday, Director Cao of the Social Bureau reported, based on reports from rice merchants, that the price of rice in Wuxi yesterday was around 1.46 million yuan per shi. Director Cao was asked if the price today could be based on this price as a standard. Director Cao instructed that the maximum price of rice today should not exceed 1.2 million yuan. However, according to a personal investigation by our reporter at rice stores last night, the retail price had reached 1.5 million yuan per shi.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Social Bureau relaxed the price limit for rice to 1 million yuan, but trading in the market still could not open because the price at the place of origin was high, the cost was high compared to the price limit, and the price of rice in Zhoupu and other places had reached 1.4 million yuan. Therefore, cargo owners are all waiting and watching and not trading, and the market is still closed.</p>
<p>In off-site transactions, white粳 was selling for 1.2 million and 1.4 million, thin rice for 1.4 million, and early rice for 1.3 million. The market outlook has weakened. If credit tightens again, prices are expected to fall today.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil initially rose and then fell, but ultimately rose again. At the opening, the rise in rice prices made people very bullish. Shengrong oil reached a high of 7 million yuan, and soybean oil reached a high of 8.5 million. At the close, due to tight credit, prices fell rapidly. Shengrong oil fell to 6.2 million, and soybean oil fell to 7.8 million. Crude oil was at 7 million, a rise of 500,000 and 1 million respectively. Soybean cake trading was scarce, and Changzi cake was 350,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour prices continued to rise sharply. At the beginning of the market, influenced by the issuance of large banknotes and the surge in prices in off-site markets in recent days, people were extremely bullish. Those holding goods were unwilling to sell easily, fearing that they would not be able to replenish them after selling. At the start of the market, prices jumped by 30-50% across the board. Midway through, news of the Central Bank's large-scale release of funds caused credit to tighten immediately. At the close, interbank interest rates were high, and cargo owners were forced to sell off, causing the market to collapse. Lao Che once broke the 500,000 mark but retreated to 450,000 at the close. Bingchuan traded at 425,000 at the last transaction.</p>
<h3>Large Denomination Banknotes Supplied to Meet Needs in Other Cities, Credit Tightens Sharply in the Market, National Bank's Efforts to Sell and Withdraw Funds Become More Active</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] Although the Central Bank announced yesterday the start of issuing three types of 50,000 yuan banknotes, a responsible person from the bank told reporters: At present, these large banknotes are still mainly supplied to meet urgent needs in other cities and are not expected to circulate in Shanghai in the short term. Yesterday, credit in various markets continued to tighten as it had over the weekend and showed no signs of easing. On the one hand, the Central Bank's efforts to sell and withdraw funds became more active, with gold, cotton yarn, foreign exchange transfer certificates, sugar, and other commodities all being offered at the same time. Although the quantities offered were large, the market was unable to absorb them due to tight credit.</p>
<p>For example, only 208 bars of gold were requested, and only 208 of the 1,245 bales of cotton yarn offered were requested. Therefore, although the prices of various commodities were eager to rise upon hearing the issuance of large banknotes, they were ultimately constrained by credit and unable to rise, resulting only in a sideways market.</p>
<p>It is also rumored that the security authorities will begin today to strictly control transactions in various markets, such as limiting the range of price increases and decreases and temporarily suspending trading if the limits are exceeded. If this is indeed the case, then the frantic speculation and price increases of the past two weeks may be slightly curbed.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] Yesterday, in the gold market, rumors of crossing the river spread, and people were unsettled. The issuance of 50,000 yuan banknotes created a bullish environment, and buying interest remained strong. Due to limited restrictions in the market, trading remained suspended, with prices shouted as high as 7.258 million, the upper limit, resulting in a market with prices but no trading. In off-site spot trading, prices opened as high as 9.5 million and 10.5 million in the morning. Due to unrelenting pressure from the Central Bank, Da De Cheng and Zhao Feng Chang gold firms were commissioned to gradually sell off at 9.3 million, down to 9 million. Due to tight funds and few buyers, only a little over 100 bars were sold. As spot goods flowed in from Hong Kong, prices retreated to 8.8 million and 9.1 million, and the market closed at noon at 9.1 million and 9.4 million. In the afternoon, due to next-day trading, the market opened at 11.5 million and 12 million, reaching as high as 12.6 million and 12.9 million. Midway through, the Central Bank continued to sell off in large quantities, pushing prices down to 11.8 million at 12.3 million. After another 500 bars were sold, sentiment stabilized, and prices fell to 11.3 million and 11.6 million, closing at 11.8 million and 12.1 million. After deducting interest of 300 yuan, the result was an increase of 600,000 compared to the end of last week.</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] Yesterday, in off-site futures trading, prices opened in the morning at 10.5 million and 11.5 million, reaching as high as 11.2 million and 11.7 million, and falling as low as 10 million and 10.3 million, closing at noon at 10.1 million and 10.4 million. In the afternoon, for same-day trading, the market opened at 10 million and 10.3 million, reached as high as 10.9 million and 11.2 million, and fell as low as 9.8 million and 10.1 million, closing at 10.4 million and 10.6 million. Next-day interest rates were 280 yuan and 300 yuan, and the margin had been settled at 12.8 million, a drop of 600,000 compared to the end of last week.</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] Yesterday, the price of gold jewelry in silver shops changed twice. In the morning, it was listed at 9 million and 10 million. In the afternoon, it rose to 10 million and 11 million, an increase of 3 million compared to the end of last week. The price of silver jewelry also rose by 20,000, to 90,000 and 110,000. Qian Dui Ye Chixi, on the day of cash transactions, was listed at 9 million and 9.7 million in the morning and rose to 9.2 million and 9.8 million in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] Yesterday, the US dollar market was active due to Guang Bang's arbitrage purchases, with strong inflows and outflows. In the morning, it opened at 200,000 and 220,000, reached as high as 210,000 and 230,000, and fell as low as 190,000 and 200,000, closing at noon at 195,000 and 200,050. In the afternoon, for next-day trading, the market opened at 235,000 and 245,000, reached as high as 250,000 and 260,000, and fell as low as 230,000 and 240,000, closing at 240,000 and 250,000. There was not much fluctuation compared to the end of last week.</p>
<h3>Potential for Squeeze Still Strong, Chinese Stocks to Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] The Chinese stock market is still showing potential for a squeeze. After the major players aggressively entered the market last week, the strength of the bullish momentum has been unexpected. Such a performance has made it impossible for the shorts to fathom the depths of the market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, news of the situation worsened, and credit tightened in the market, with most factors being bearish. However, many players have already made a covert exit to avoid reversals. After pushing up prices in the morning, they gradually sold off, and the market finally retreated at the close. In the afternoon, due to the convenience of deferral, it is expected that credit will ease after tightening, and although there will be twists and turns in the situation, the reality will not be as simple as the rumors suggest. Therefore, major players are still mostly absorbing shares, and the market will rebound again.</p>
<p>Yong Sha opened in the morning and immediately hit the upper limit of 110 yuan and 5 jiao. Various parties successively sold off, retreating to 101 yuan. Off-site, it was even pushed down to 97 yuan. Later, the shorts covered their positions, and the price rose to 106 yuan and 5 jiao at the close.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks were also spurred by Yong Sha at the opening and initially reported limit-up. Xinhe, Meiya, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, Huafeng Department Store, Guohuo, Rongchang, Tongyi, Yonggong, Lianan Department Store, Zhabei, Shangwu, Zhongyi, Zhenhua, Zhonghuo, Shangni, Taitang, and 19 other stocks all opened at the upper limit. Prices retreated in the middle, and the market recovered slightly at the noon close.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Yong Sha opened at 110 yuan and 05 jiao, still opening at the upper limit and remaining unchanged at the close. Applications for sales were first made at 107 yuan and 5 jiao, and the price once lingered around 100 yuan. However, it then rebounded as it was resisted at the low, and buying suddenly surged. After fluctuating, it rose again to 110 yuan at the close. Many of the other stocks also reached their limits. A total of 2.8825 billion shares were traded.</p>
<h3>Gold Bonds at Limit Up, Foreign Stocks Continue to be Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, credit tightened, and Chinese stocks first rose and then retreated, with the gold public bond following the trend. Prices fluctuated greatly in the middle and hit the limit-up several times. The market closed slightly lower at noon. It opened at 3.2 million and rose to 3.456 million, hitting the limit. After buying at the previous day's limit-up price in the afternoon, trading immediately became quiet and there was not much activity, with very few transactions. There was a squeeze of 576,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to be strong. In the morning, the sharp rise in foreign exchange certificates and the briskness of Chinese stocks made people feel good. Various parties continued to absorb shares, and the market closed with another squeeze. Yisha was 235,000 yuan and 245,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan. Yinglian was 260,000 and 280,000. Yi Chang was 46,000 yuan and 48,000 yuan. Yazhou was 26,000 yuan and 28,000 yuan (there were no transactions on Saturday). Yaoguang was bought at 90,000 yuan, and Huidong was bought at 1 million yuan. Neither was sold.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate of Gold to Silver Dollars Still One to Fifty-Two Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] The Central Bank's exchange rate of gold to Yuan Datou silver dollars remained unchanged yesterday at the old price of one liang to fifty-two yuan. About 4,000 liang of gold were exchanged yesterday, resulting in the release of about 200,000 yuan in silver dollars.</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] Yesterday, at the Stock Exchange Building, the exchange ratio of gold to silver was initially 47.50 for Datou and once rose to 48.51. It then fell to 47.50 near noon. In the afternoon, it fell further to 45.50. Xiaotou was at 58, with only selling and no buying. Yinglongyang had no market.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Arbitrage Not Active, Street Trading Initially Firm but Then Weak</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] Yesterday, silver dollar arbitrage was not active, and the exchange rate was stable. About 100,000 sets were sold to the Hua North area, while trading with Hua West was sluggish, with only a few tens of thousands of yuan being traded.</p>
<p>Street trading was initially firm but then weak. In the morning, the market was chaotic due to the efforts of individual buyers, and Datou once hit the 200,000 mark, reaching as high as 210,000 and 230,000.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Price Increase Slightly Controlled, Cloth Market Closes at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rise in cotton yarn prices was somewhat controlled. Due to the continued tightening of credit, people were quite worried, and purchases were rare, so the result was still an increase, if you include the interest, not enough for the costs.</p>
<p>42s Lanfeng opened in the morning at 66 million and once briefly hit the 70 million mark, closing at noon at 63 million, 6 million higher than the previous week. 32s Yinyue fell from 47 million all the way to 44 million at the close, and closed 6 million higher.</p>

Trading in other yarns was quiet, and all parties adopted a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>The trend of cotton cloth was vague. In the morning, people were still hoping for higher prices, and purchases continued to be enthusiastic, with new high prices emerging one after another. However, after 9:30, news that the opening price of gold was not enough to cover interest costs and that credit was still tight, with overnight interest rates between 20 and 30 yuan, caused sentiment to turn bearish. Retailers began to sell, and prices fell from high levels, with prices near noon mostly leveling out with the previous off-site prices.</p>
<p>Longtou Xibu rose from 1.23 million to a high of 1.26 million, but then fell to 1.05 million near noon, closing at 1.08 million, still 180,000 higher than the noon closing price on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sijunzi Huaji opened initially at 1.2 million, reached a high of 1.215 million, fell to 1.02 million before the close, and finally traded at 1.04 million, an increase of 170,000. People in the aftermarket are again considering action, raising prices by 30%, opening Longtou Xibu at 1.38 million and Sijunzi Huaji at 1.36 million. With limited trade, it may be difficult to stabilize today.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Interport Football Team Wins Against Manila Five to One</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 17th] The Hong Kong Football Club interport team, on an expedition to Manila, defeated the Manila team by a score of five to one at the Rizal Memorial Stadium last night. 14,000 people were in attendance. 20 minutes after the start of the game, Hong Kong team center forward Zhu Yongqiang scored from five yards away from the goal, opening the scoring.

<h3>Encas and Shanghai Police, Two Seeded Teams, to Battle Dolphin and Donghua Tonight</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the Mayor's Cup basketball tournament, two seeded teams in Group Three, Encas and Shanghai Police, will battle Dolphin and Donghua respectively this evening. The two winning teams will meet next week to compete for the final spot in the round-robin finals. Tickets for the municipal gymnasium are still divided into three categories: 5,000 yuan upstairs, 10,000 yuan downstairs, and 20,000 yuan for reserved seats inside the court. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Encas - Dolphin 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Shanghai Police - Donghua 7:00 PM</p>
<p>The Encas players are mostly veterans who have lived in Shanghai for many years and are very familiar with the strategies and strengths of the various Chinese teams. In addition, they possess superior physical attributes. Their strength is such that they can threaten any team. In this league, they recruited Boto, the main player from the American Meteorological team, with great ambition. Although for various reasons, they did not win the league, they defeated the runner-up Renyu in the first week and put on a spectacular performance in the final game against the league champion Hualian. Now joining the Mayor's Cup, they have also invited giant mainstay Tao Bolinji to help them, with the intention of compensating for their losses. Dolphin is one of the top teams in Group Two. Tao Yingshi, Huang Tianlie, Lu Miaosheng, and Hou Yongkang are all young and strong. Recently, they defeated the champion of Group Two, Section D, the Shan team, and are at their peak. Facing the strong Encas tonight, although victory is unlikely, they will certainly pose a considerable threat to the foreign troops.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai Police versus Donghua match, the latter is making a guest appearance in the basketball arena with a soccer player's style. Although they started late, their style is fierce and they are extremely brave. In addition, they have veterans like Zhou Dayun, Chen Xianglong, and Cai Yanxiong, who are intelligent and brave. However, Shanghai Police is one of the top teams in Group One, with strong strength and particularly sharp fast-break skills. Recently, they have been training hard. In comparison, Shanghai Police is more likely to win.</p>
<h3>Dagong Basketball to Fight McLeans Tomorrow</h3>
<p>After returning from their expedition to Nanyang, the defending Mayor's Cup champion Dagong basketball team has not yet officially revealed their skills. It is reported that they will make their first public performance tomorrow night at the gymnasium, and their opponent will be the McLeans team. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Shocking Hong Kong: A Good Game, South China Wins by Two Goals, Buses Regret Leaving the Field</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Aviation News] "During the Qingming Festival, the rain falls in torrents; on the road, the souls of the travelers are broken." This ancient poem seems to be a sharp portrayal of the weather in recent days and the Buses fans who lost to South China yesterday!</p>
<p>Similarly, the Buses heroes, who adjusted their lineup to cope with this important game related to the future of the runner-up position and worked hard throughout the game, even experiencing several unfortunate situations where victory was possible but not achieved, inevitably felt frustrated. Even more unbearable was the fate of the thousands of fans who squeezed in the rain to buy tickets, endured the pushing and shoving of "scalpers," and were still turned away because the stadium was full. They sighed that it was not worth it!</p>
<p>In this shocking "South China vs. Buses" battle, both sides lived up to the expectations of the fans. South China's two-goal victory was not accidental, and Buses' loss, although it affected their future, was the result of their best efforts. Their performance was no worse than their opponents, and they could take comfort in their spirit.</p>
<p>Many "critics" believe that Buses' experience was not as good as South China's in the rain. Ma's sprints were useless! In other words, Buses' defeat is all included in this sentence. In fact, this view only applies to ordinary times. Judging from the wise and brave performances of Deng Yijie and Li Chunfa in yesterday's game, with their wonderful passing and rushing, it is enough to prove that this is a "clichéd" view.</p>
<p>In fact, both sides are seasoned veterans. In terms of experience, Buses is not weaker than South China. They were able to see in yesterday's game that under the slippery conditions caused by the rain, they could not use high, long passes and long-distance quick attack tactics. This is because South China's defenders have a defense line that combines both strength and flexibility. It is impossible to break through with just fierce quick attacks without clever infiltration. Buses' forwards had such a "knowing the enemy and knowing yourself" mindset yesterday. In addition to consistently maintaining Wenzhi as the center of command for passing, Yijie and Chunfa also had skillful and agile dribbling skills. When appropriate, they did not give up the opportunity to rush forward for profit, which is commendable. Dahui and Shijin were also able to cooperate with this tactic, creating a lively advancement of the entire Buses forward line. The reason they could not succeed was due to Yu Yaode's repeated saves and the bad luck of several shots hitting the crossbar.</p>
<p>People's criticisms also attribute Buses' loss of two goals to Tan Junqian's poor saves. In fact, if Buses had not had Lao Tan guarding the goal yesterday, displaying all his skills, South China would have won by more than just two goals. Because what Buses lost yesterday were not easy goals, but "center balls" from close range, as fast as lightning. We saw the mischievousness of South China's three inside forwards, which showed that their victory was not accidental. Fei Chunhua also played well. Only He Yingfen lacked vitality, which may be due to "Blackie" being unaccustomed to the left position, which seems forgivable.</p>
<p>In short, in this "good game," the offense and defense of both sides were balanced, and both sides were able to grasp the time and did not let go of any opportunity. The fact that South China's forwards won and their defense remained unbeaten was the reason why Buses' forwards could not succeed. The lineups of both sides in this game are as follows: (Fifteen Lang)</p>
<p>South China</p>
<p>Zhang Shuling, Liu Songsheng, He Yingfen, Zhu Yongqiang</p>
<p>Yu Yaode, Xie Jinhong, Zhang Jinhai, Feng Jingxiang</p>
<p>Hou Rongsheng, Xie Jinhe, Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Buses Team</p>
<p>Tan Zhenhui, Feng Kunsheng, Zhuo Shijin, Zou Wenzhi</p>
<p>Tan Junqian, Kong Qingyu, Deng Yijie, Li Chunfa</p>
<p>Mai Linfu, Deng Sen, Li Dahui</p>
<p>Under the whistle of "Referee King" Aoma, the ball launched the offensive under the feet of Deng Yijie, but soon South China gained the advantage. On this side, "Second Uncle" shot twice from long range, both over the crossbar. Zhu Zai also used a hundred-step piercing Yang, and "Blackie" and Jinhai's two headers were all cleared by Junqian. However, after a long attack, He Yingfen forced two corner kicks. In the last one, Second Uncle intercepted it and handed it over to Yongqiang. Zhu Zai did not hesitate and lifted his feet to shoot. Junqian could not save it because it was a sudden cold arrow. Therefore, South China laid the foundation for victory in the sound of firecrackers lit by the supporters.</p>
<p>The second half continued to face off. In the early stage, South China still had the upper hand. Once, Liu Songsheng took advantage of a free kick outside of Buses’ offense and took a fierce shot at the goal. Zou Zhiwen desperately headed the ball to break the crisis, but he fell to the ground and fainted and had to be taken off the field for treatment. South China took the opportunity to heavily surround and attack. Songsheng received the ball in his heart and handed it to Zhu Zai. Yongqiang darted forward and shot, as fast as a shooting star, creating another great achievement for South China (two to zero)</p>
<p>Not long after, Wenzhi reluctantly returned to the game and launched a fierce offensive. Especially Li Dahui’s several crosses and Shijin’s several timely headers were saved by the well-positioned “Liangde”. Afterwards, the momentum was still strong, but there was still no way to break the egg. In the 70-minute battle, Buses finally left the field with a loss of two goals.</p>

<h3>Group B Table Tennis League: Six Matches Today</h3>
<p>Yucai Young Players Overwhelm Agricultural Machinery the Night Before</p>
<p>The fourth Table Tennis League has been underway for a week since its start. The results of each game will be announced in the order they are received. The organizing authority recently reviewed the schedule for the first week and found that the record sheet for the match between Guansheng and Agricultural Machinery in Group B3 on the 14th has not been submitted. It has not been reported whether the game was held or whether both parties agreed to postpone it. Failure to comply with the regulations shows a lack of spirit. It is now limited to two days to notify the meeting of the details. If it is overdue, both parties will be considered to have forfeited. Tonight (the 19th), starting at 7:00 PM, there will be six more Group B matches in the table tennis rooms of Jing Zong, Chouye, Shanbao, and Deng. The strong Zhaoshang team in Group B2 won a big victory over Lianqing with a score of five to zero in the first game. It is worthy of being a seeded team. This is the second time they have played and they meet Shanghai Police. Although the latter is led by educator Ma Qingzhi, the team's experience is not as good as Zhaoshang's, and it is expected to be more dangerous than auspicious. In the next scene, Lianhe will face off against Jiaotong. The former won the Insurance Cup runner-up. Last week, the new force of the debut, Tiemai, was weakened due to the absence of veteran Shi Jianzhang. It only won a narrow victory with three teams to two. Jiaotong has strong player Sheng Risheng participating. If Lianhe does not send its full force, it is afraid of being threatened by the opponent. Among the other four groups, the match between Nongji and Jingwei in Group B3 will be a fierce battle. Jingwei are all young players who have just debuted. They are physically flexible and willing to fight and run. If Nongji treats them lightly, they will undoubtedly suffer a poisonous hand. The schedule for each night and the results of the previous day are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>Zhaoshang - Shanghai Police (Group B2) 7:00 PM Jing Zong</p>
<p>Lianhe - Jiaotong (Group B2) 8:30 PM Jing Zong</p>

<h3>Table Tennis Strong Team Hualian Team Participates in Group A Competition and Wins Championship</h3>
<p>The Hualian Table Tennis Team has participated in the first and second Group A Table Tennis League, ranking among the best and being known as one of the five strongest teams at sea. In the previous competition, the team split into two groups and joined the competition under the names of Hualan and Nanhua, which affected their strength and their results were not very good. However, Hualan still relied on the efforts of veterans Zhang Zhihong, Deng Xiurong, and Li Zhen to win the fifth place. This year, they are still registered under the name of Hualian, and held a team member meeting at 7:00 PM last night at Dekang Lane, Luofu Road. The list of staff members is as follows:</p>
<p>Liang Jintang (Advisor), Chen Linsheng (Instructor), Huang Qingtang (Leader), Zhang Zhihong (Captain), Li Ziping (Clerk), Yang Zhixiong (Secretary), Deng Xiurong, Li Zhen, Lu Wenliang, Zhong Zhizhi, Pan Rixi, Zheng Jiakun.</p>
<h3>Table Tennis Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Written by Wang Xinjing, Edited by Chen Linsheng</p>
<p>The limit is the representative of the heart. Skilled table tennis players do not pay attention to watching the ball, but measure the opponent's face with their eyes, according to the direction of their own counterattack. Therefore, skilled table tennis players often observe the opponent's eyes to judge the direction of the opponent's return. However, this decision is often easily fooled. Some people focus their eyes on a certain direction, but hit the ball in the opposite direction. This kind of playing style is more likely to confuse the opponent and make it impossible to cope.</p>
<p>(8) General Practice Steps</p>
<p>To improve at table tennis, you must go through the appropriate steps and practice step by step, and you will improve quickly. For example, children learning to run must first learn to stand, and then learn to walk. When they are walking steadily, they can learn to run. If they can't stand yet, it is impossible to ask them to walk, and it is even more impossible to ask them to run.</p>
<p>To practice table tennis, you must first lay the foundation for defense. That is, when competing with others, you must first defend and maintain not losing, and then look for opportunities to attack.</p>
<p>There are many ways to defend. The first thing to learn is "close blocking." Regardless of whether the opponent's ball is lightly drawn or heavily hit, you must return the ball with the most honest attitude, only seeking to hit it a few more times to prolong the opportunity to practice. After practicing hard like this, after a certain period of time, you will gain more experience, become familiar with the nature of the ball, and be able to respond to any kind of ball. Then practice "far blocking" and "chopping." After practicing various defensive methods, take it a step further and practice "light drawing." Although this kind of light drawing does not have much power, it is more powerful than "chopping," and can prevent the opponent's fierce attacks or fierce chopping, and can make the ball more accurate and less hard. After practicing light drawing with considerable certainty, gradually increase the power of "drawing" under accurate conditions, reaching the point of fierce attack and hard knock.</p>
<p>"Close blocking" is the basis of "far blocking" and "chopping," and "light drawing" is the basis of fierce attack. Therefore, to practice the ball, you must practice defense. To defend, you must first practice "close blocking." After practicing "close blocking," "far blocking," and "chopping" well, you can take it a step further and practice light drawing and fierce attack. This method is like building a house and laying the foundation first. If the foundation is deep-rooted, the danger will naturally be less.</p>

<h3>Thoughts Inspired by the Cheongsam</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>Observing the styles of women's cheongsams, one finds them truly interesting.</p>
<p>Their styles have not fundamentally changed in over thirty years, yet they are constantly evolving, and the frequency of these changes is accelerating. Consequently, when the patterns become exhausted, the gimmicks have been fully exploited, and there is no room for further ingenuity, they simply revert to the old styles of several years ago. In short: it is nothing more than from old to new, from new to old, from wide to tight, from tight to wide; sometimes long is popular, sometimes shorter is popular, or zippers replace buttons, then zippers return to buttons. Moreover, because the time of change is becoming faster and faster, the materials of cheongsams are also becoming more and more inferior, because a cheongsam can't be worn for very long anyway. And precisely because of this, the number of cheongsams made is increasing, and the number of pattern changes is becoming even greater.</p>
<p>The reason women do this is simply to gain the attention of passersby with astonished eyes. However, after changing back and forth, the cheongsam is still a cheongsam after all. Therefore, the style of the cheongsam is gradually failing to attract people's favor.</p>
<p>Ladies, please don't misunderstand! The purpose of this article is not about cheongsams, but to use them as an analogy to describe our "financial policies." Because the financial measures of recent years are doing the same job with different approaches, just like the cheongsams on your bodies.</p>
<p>For example: the legal tender has been in circulation for too long, and one inevitably feels that its "generous" style is too rigid, so it is replaced by the petite and exquisite "gold certificate." But the tone of the gold certificate is also tiring to look at, so one wants to try the "silver certificate."</p>
<p>According to the law of evolution of women's cheongsams, the style of the silver certificate will either be the same size as the debased currency or even smaller and "cuter" than the gold certificate. The latter is more likely, because the time the gold certificate was popular was more than twenty times shorter than the legal tender, so how long the silver certificate will last is difficult to determine. Therefore, it is better to make it small and thin.</p>
<p>Although the legal tender is not called a "certificate," its essence is indeed just a "certificate." It must be known that this "certificate" is the crux of the problem, so gold certificates and silver certificates are bound to share the same fate as the legal tender. From gold certificate to silver certificate, to copper certificate, to lead certificate, to "foreign lead skin certificate," this is a natural trend of one certificate being worse than another, which is no different from the principle that the more patterns women's cheongsams change, the more the material "deteriorates."</p>
<p>From the cheongsam to the "silver dollar certificate" is just an association of real life. I hope gentlemen and ladies will not read this article with a stern face, just laugh it off.</p>
<h3>### The Candidate Who Made a Fortune</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>In any country, those who participate in local or central elections are either famous or wealthy and powerful. Otherwise, lacking any appeal or confidence in the election, they would not only waste time, energy, and money, but also make themselves look foolish. However, in the history of US presidential elections, there was an unknown and powerless young man who participated in the election. Although he was not successful, he actually made a fortune.</p>
<p>This person who used the election to make money was named George Francis Train. He was originally an unknown commoner who suddenly announced in 1870 that he would participate in the 1872 US presidential election. Train had no political background and no sponsors. He simply said that he was a Democrat and wanted to be nominated by the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>He actively campaigned throughout the country for several months before the nomination convention. However, at the Democratic nomination convention, Train's name was not even mentioned.</p>
<p>Everyone felt quite sorry, because such efforts had been wasted. But Train himself was not discouraged after the election failure. Several years later, everyone realized that his participation in the election had another purpose: not for fame, but for profit.</p>
<p>He gave hundreds of campaign speeches, and people who attended the speeches had to pay for tickets. Because his participation in the election was different from others, without background or momentum, although admission tickets were required for each speech, many people still came out of curiosity. After hundreds of speeches, Train actually received about 100,000 US dollars in ticket revenue. From then on, he "withdrew from the political arena" and lived comfortably in the countryside.</p>
<h3>### Odds and Ends of the World</h3>
<p>— Chen Qiji</p>
<p>A professor at the University of California in the United States said: Every kiss between a man and a woman shortens life by three minutes. Because every time you kiss, the chest beats, and the blood circulation in the heart is uncoordinated, so 484 kisses will shorten one day of life, and 75,000 kisses will lead to death one year earlier.</p>
<p>Baharah of New York can be called the Sherlock Holmes of the fur industry. If you give him a hair plucked from a fur coat, after his scientific examination, he can tell you not only the species that produced the hair, but even the location where the animal lived, the season when it died, and the food it liked when it was alive.</p>
<p>The United States has recently invented a typewriter that can be called the smallest in the world. Its volume is only three cubic inches, and its function is the same as that of daily use. This machine is most useful for travelers.</p>
<h3>### The Streets are Full of Big Head Voices</h3>
<p>— Yu Wangwo</p>
<h3>### Advance Preview of "Middle-Aged Woes"</h3>
<p>— Li Ruiyun</p>
<p>By chance, I saw a secret preview of "Middle-Aged Woes." After seeing "Fake Phoenixes" and "Long Live the Wife," the audience unanimously recognized that Sang Hu is a master of comedy, whether he writes or directs; in this new work, Mr. Sang Hu has taken a further step in his handling of comedy. He has already passed the stage of "making comedy" (that is, so-called gimmicks), and let the play itself give the audience a "feeling of joy." Therefore, the development of the whole play is smooth and light, like a beautiful poem, but every shot and every foot of film has a deep connotation, which makes people smile knowingly.</p>
<p>From "Fake Phoenixes" to "Everyone is Adulterous," Shi Hui's acting skills have undoubtedly become fixed. Someone once said that the Shen Yang he directed in "Mother" is Shi Hui's own shadow. The elementary school principal in "Middle-Aged Woes," with the help of the script and director, also broke through the stagnant line and caught up with Mr. Sang Hu. The heroine Zhu Jiachen is said to have been seen by the director as the third sister in "Big Reunion," and he asked for her help out of friendship. The character of Liu Minhua has been powerfully visualized under her superb performance, especially the scene where Shi Hui proposes to her, which is the climax of the whole play, and also the climax of the performance. She exposed the enthusiasm latent in her heart without any forced or excessive feeling. We should have great expectations for the rise of this new screen star.</p>
<p>The story of "Middle-Aged Woes" is about the joys and sorrows of a middle-aged man. He has abundant vitality, but his environment forces him to be an old man enjoying his old age. This forcibly suppressed emotion finally erupts, and he gives his remaining vitality to society. The playwright sarcastically explains here that the general attitude of middle-aged people to spend their years in leisure is a waste of life. He uses Liu Minhua's dialogue to convey his idea: "At your age, you have knowledge and experience, which is the most mature stage of life. It is a pity not to make good use of this stage!" (General idea) Finally, "Chen's Cemetery" was changed to "Chen's Elementary School," and a new little life was born at the same time. Chen Shaochang said: "I feel that my life has just begun, just like him." This is an even more powerful revelation.</p>
<p>"Middle-Aged Woes" is a refreshing, fluent, connotative and powerful good play.</p>
<h3>### Silver Dollar Inscription</h3>
<p>— Pi Ji</p>
<p>A currency is not judged by its size (referring to the gold yuan certificate), but by its value; a head is not judged by its newness (referring to the Sun Yat-sen small head), but by its ability to be large. This is a silver dollar, only its quality lasts long. After many years of not showing its whiteness, it suddenly meets Qing again; there are wealthy people who manipulate it, and no poor people who collect it. It can tune the zither and strengthen the nerves. It sounds pleasant to the ear, and saves the trouble of devaluation. It is used to being close to doors like the sea, and fears seeing rooms like pavilions. Scholars say: What silver is there! (Moved to help education)</p>
<h3>### Bleeding</h3>
<p>— Xin Xiu</p>
<p>People who have money to speculate often say: "Out with silver, in with gold," or "Out with gold, in with banknotes." Between this buying and selling, silver and gold yuan roll in "without any effort."</p>
<p>We poor people are unlucky, we have neither gold nor silver, we have nothing to take out, only bleeding, sweating. All day long, we bury our heads in exhausting our minds, this is invisible blood; even more pitiful are those milkmaids who abandon their own children to feed other people's children; and those who give blood to patients in hospitals are truly bleeding.</p>
<p>Wedding and funeral invitations fly to your desk one after another, forcing you to take out your wallet to "give gifts as etiquette." That is also a kind of hard injury bleeding!</p>
<h3>### Various Lighthouses</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qing</p>
<p>Working in a lighthouse myself, I happened to read the erroneous descriptions of lighthouses by writers and poets, and I often laugh to myself when I recall that I used to have such errors. This is probably because the institution of the lighthouse is too unfamiliar to the general public.</p>
<p>In the imagination of ordinary people, the light emitted by the lighthouse at night is enough to illuminate the dark sea around it like daylight. In fact, this is not accurate. Although the light emitted from the lighthouse has a luminous power of hundreds of thousands of candlepower, it is only a "signal." You probably don't believe it, but in the lighthouses on remote islands, they only use a few ordinary kerosene lamps to spend the night. The establishment of the lighthouse was originally for the navigation of ships traveling on the distant sea, so the light emitted by the lighthouse is parallel to the sea surface, neither upwards nor downwards, so the people inside the lighthouse cannot share any light.</p>
<p>Since the lighthouse is a navigation mark, although there are many lighthouses in the world, the shape, height, and color painted on the exterior of each tower are different. For navigators, these differences are a great convenience. At night, the light emitted by each tower is also different, not only the time of flashing light and dark is different, but some lighthouses also emit several colors of light to increase the vigilance of navigation. Navigators use these individual characteristics of the lighthouse to measure and calculate the accurate position of their ships.</p>
<p>When we open the map, we can see that almost all routes pass through many large and small islands and headlands, as well as reefs and bright rocks scattered around. These are the biggest enemies of maritime traffic, they are like lurking demons and sea monsters, with the ambition to devour ships at any time. In the daytime, navigators can avoid dangerous places by the different shapes of the islands, but at night, it is like "a blind man riding a blind horse," without any guarantee, and there is danger of causing trouble everywhere. If a navigator cannot find an expected lighthouse when sailing at night, his anxiety is beyond words. Because "a miss is as good as a mile," one mistake could be the end of the ship. Therefore, the lighthouse is nothing less than an angel of navigators, and these angels guarantee the safety of navigation. Some lighthouses are equipped with radio, radar, fog horns, signal cannons, and other devices. When the fog rises and navigation is dangerous, they immediately sound an alarm to warn passing ships, so that they will not be at a loss and cause a major disaster.</p>
<p>Because most lighthouses are located on dangerous and remote islands, the staff who work on these remote islands to release light and send out warnings on time live a rather lonely and arduous life. These remote islands are rarely visited by people in peacetime, and once the wind and waves rise, the transportation between the remote islands and the outside world is completely cut off. At that time, what the staff face day and night are the turbulent waves in front of them and the ruthless sand and rocks under their feet. —Written at the North Island Lighthouse in Penghu</p>
