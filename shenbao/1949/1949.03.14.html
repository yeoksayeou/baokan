<h3 id="c9">北平型（二） <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>（關於「局部和平」前後的一個城市的報道）</p>
<p>據聞在東北長瀋撤守的時候，毛澤東曾派了一位代表到北平，向傅作義作和談的試探，希望用政治方式解決華北的問題。這位代表在北平住了十多天，沒用得到傅作義的具體答覆，便怏怏而去。此次共軍把平津包圍後，共軍便以廣播攻勢，催促傅作義及各級部隊長派遣代表洽談，周北峯曾代表傅作義出城去接過一次頭。但是那時察北還沒有失利。傅自信尚可一擊，沒有亟於求和的決心。後來因察北失利，基本主力損失完了。武力是軍人的政治資本，力量完了便不得不考慮次一步驟，才又派鄧寶珊和周北峯出城接洽。天津戰事結束，北平完全孤立。加以江淮戰役失利，南京的政治行情。一天天在低落，華中白崇禧程　又有一番聯絡，便促成了傅作義和談的決心，而和談的暗流便具體而積極的在進行着了。</p>
<p>在和談暗流進行的另一面，便是風頭人物所策動的社會和平運動。如天津的四位參議員出城談和，和談尚未得到結果，而天津的戰事便已結束了。北平也有許多名流學者呼籲和平，保存古都文物，有所謂和平促進會之組織。傅作義也一再邀請北平各大學教授，徵詢對和平的意見。其中還有一個插曲，便是前北平市長何思源，由南京飛到北平，極力鼓吹和平運動，一時成為新聞人物，而得到兩個定時炸彈的代價。這兩個炸彈幸而是他太太屋頂上的炸彈先爆發，他因聞到爆炸聲便跑到太太的屋子裏去了，結果便炸死了他的二小組，他自己及太太和兒女都受了傷。倘若是他自己屋頂上的炸彈先爆發，也許已經沒命了！可是何思源並不因此灰心，仍舊負傷參加和平代表團，出城與共軍接洽。在這次接談中，何思源極力為傅作義的思想行動，與共軍人員發生了一番爭辯，毫無具體結果而返。其實這些動作，都不過是表面上的姿態或做作，實際的決定，却還是暗中在進行。</p>
<p>鄧寶珊和周北峯便服傅作義，與共軍的林彪聶榮臻及葉劍英都見過了面，商得了具體的辦法。但是傅作義還要看看全國的大勢如何在變，中央有無更好的辦法拿出來？所以拖延着一直沒有宣佈，和決心來執行。共產黨人便批評傅作義缺乏魄力，說他三魂七魄，連一魄都沒有。自總統發表元旦文告，到江淮戰爭失利結束，長江吃緊，宣佈無條件停戰，南京的政治行情一落千丈。傅作義在得到蔣總統決定通電引退的消息，便也同時決定了接受共軍局部和平的條件，宣佈付諸實行。這是傅作義的一番苦心，因為這樣的做法，對於蔣先生和中央也似乎很過得去了。</p>
<p>元月廿二日晚上，華北剿總的發言人，正式宣佈了北平局部和平辦法的十三個要點，其中主要者為：（一）城內國軍開出城外指定地點，於一個月內改編；共軍亦撤退三十里。（二）省市政府仍照常執行職務，聽侯改組。（三）設立聯合辦事機構，處理雙方一切有關事項。（四）繼續使用金圓券。（五）保障公教人員生命安全。（六）郵電交通機關照常執行業務。（七）報社，通訊社及宣傳機構照常出版，重新辦理審查登記手續。（八）保障人民生命財產之安全。（九）人民宗教信仰自由。……等等，據後來共軍進城後所稱，這些要點的內容是不甚完全的。不過這十三個要點宣佈以後，一般公教人員及民衆好像吃了一顆定心丸，為之大安！國為大家慶幸北平可免於砲火之災，而且個人又可得到生命財產安全的保障，便照常的過着日子混下去。至於政治上的得失，將來前途如何變化？當然留到次一步再去考慮。</p>
<p>在二十二日傳佈着北平局部和平實現的消息，物價曾一度猛跌，銀元落到每元合金券一百八十元，兵船面粉每袋只合三元現洋。但是二十三日早上報紙刊載十三要點後，物價又繼續上昇，逐漸恢復了原狀，後來現洋竟漲到二千五百元一塊了。（待續）</p>
<h3 id="c10">新閣將即向共黨徵詢　和平談判開始期　促請中共能早日派出和談代表　政府間團結更趨緊密 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕何應欽之新閣首要工作，顯為與中共繼續進行和談。據和談代表邵力子十三日告記者稱：代表團之行期，即可由新閣向共黨徵詢和談開始之日期後予以決定，同時，並促請共黨亦能早日派出代表。又關於政府所提派之和談代表，其中迭有請辭者，惟政府迄至目前止，尚未有新人選之指派。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社香港十三日電〕此間多數獨立而有資格之觀察家，認為何應欽提名為新首揆之結果，恐難對於國共間和平有改善之望。渠等由於何應欽過去與蔣前總統之關係，認為何氏今後之任務，實際係在阻止李代總統對共黨作重大讓步，並根據毛澤東八項條件，舉行和平談判。此間一般意見，對於李代總統結束內戰之和平誠意並不懷疑，但深恐渠十一日在南京所發表對於和平極具信心之宣言，事實上係毫無根據者。何應欽之權力，繫建於各將領及各省長官上，然此勢力在預期中之和平談判與共黨舉行和談時，實不足以重行建立一共同陣綫。大部份人士對於何氏之軍事才能及在政府萬一決定拒絕中共要求時，何氏能否激厲士氣，亦頗表示懷疑。</p>
<h3 id="c11">中共圖分化政府　達個別擊破目的 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕據一向消息確實之人士，十三日向記者透露：中共刻正設法分化政府，以達成個別擊破之目的。據謂中共目前以李代總統為和談對象，對於未來「全面和平」後之聯合政府機構中，表示可同意李代總統及白崇禧參加；但對「全面和平」下之京·滬地區之駐軍問題，則堅主採取混合編制。該人士並對記者聲稱：中共且欲採取分化政策，以聯絡李代總統，以打擊蔣總統，但李代總統知悉此項意向後，並未為其所動。且以最近之政事動態觀之，蔣·李之密切團結，中共所欲達成分化之目的，顯難實現。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕李代總統主政迄今月餘，在此期間，外間一再傳播蔣李之間似有若干誤會或誤解之存在，十三日某政府中身份極高之權威人士告記者，稱：張治中此次奉化之行，已使目前蔣總統與李代總統之間，求到黨與政府內部更緊密之團結。該人士對此顯示極大欣慰。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕據相當可靠方面消息，引退之蔣總統，決定於最近數日內離溪口，移往鼓浪嶼小住，惟赴鼓嶼後，是否仍返溪口，現尚未悉。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十三日電〕張治中十三日告某報記者稱：蔣總裁告以在五年內脫離政治，予李代總統全權秉政。張氏繼稱，蔣氏「歉然」談及其以往政治上之失敗，因此，渠無意再涉足政治。但張治中又謂，蔣氏為革命黨人，將繼續領導國民黨致力革命工作。渠稱，蔣總裁正密切注視國民黨改革，加強黨的組織及恢復黨的革命精神。張氏並謂，蔣總統引退後，體重增加八磅，自一一八磅增至一二六磅。渠復稱，蔣總統精神甚佳，每日遊山。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕陳毅所部華東野戰軍，截至今日止，顯已置其主力於蘇北及皖中兩區之長江北岸濱江地帶。二個月以來，共黨雖亦倡言謀和，實際上在其所佔之黃河以南，竭力整補，逐步南下，除劉伯承所統率之中原野戰軍十餘縱隊外，陳毅所部一至十二縱隊，外加民兵升級組成新四·七·八·三個縱隊，連同快速·兩廣·渤海·長江四縱隊，總計達十九個縱隊，為數約三十萬人，業已結集靖江·揚州·兩泰·及無為。和縣兩區。十二日京中曾一度傳言無為湯家溝江心洲上有共軍飲馬江邊，經江南岸哨兵以槍擊篤之故事。關於各縱隊之詳盡位置，此間軍方亦在綜情判定中，倘共軍對和談認為「不妨由和談者去和談，由備戰者去戰爭」，則二個月來共軍之迫近江北岸工作可謂已告完成，其第二步之表演，大致摧毀長江北岸國軍西起懷寗東至口岸之橋頭陣地守軍。關於長江北岸各橋頭堡情況，至今晚止，尚無一處發生變故，均極安謐；惟漫長六百公里背水孤立之江北據點，官兵任務極為艱鉅，心情尤為沉重。京中雖傳共軍林彪部業已過徐州南下，陳毅所部將於三月廿日以後準備全面渡江，然要皆視今後二週內江北全綫橋頭堡爭奪情況之發展而確定。</p>

<p>—對何院長希望之—</p>
<p>何應欽將軍被提任為行憲以後的第三任行政院院長，十二日已獲立法院二〇九票之大多數同意票，順利通過。朝野人士都認為此時此地，求能翊贊李代總統，支持危局，足任閣揆之選者，殆非何將軍莫屬。古人云，「斯人不出，如蒼生何？」今日何將軍所負之人望，自亦不讓前賢。</p>
<p>何將軍雖尚未就行政院院長之新任，但在西湖避壽之際，經李代總統之促駕，各方友好之敦勸，當可接受任命；昨午由杭來滬而後，出席國民黨留滬中央委員座談會，交換意見，並將分訪賢達，聽取輿論，同時徴求民青兩黨參加新閣。即此一端，足見何將軍虛懷若谷，自知其於此時出任艱鉅，對於政策之決定，閣員之人選，不能不作鄭重的考慮。</p>
<p>何將軍出組新閣之前夕，蔣總統特親書「安危須仗，甘苦共嘗」八字，祝其六秩壽辰。大家都知道當年國父孫中山先生曾為蔣總統手書「安危他日終須仗，甘苦來時要共嘗」一聯，今天何將軍受此八字於引退的蔣總統，可知在蔣先生對何將軍期望之深，殆有類於當年孫先生之期望於蔣先生者，而何將軍此次之受命於李代總統，尤足微其身繫國家之安危，共嘗甘苦，已不必待之於來日了。</p>
<p>何院長昨天發表書面談話，謂將以團結革新之精神，謀政治之改進與和平之實現。語雖簡單，意實沉重。但各方對何院長殷切的期望，當非此寥寥數語所能使之饜足。言軍事，則切望其整編軍隊，言政治則渴盼其裁併機構，言經濟則尤冀其能實施民生主義的社會政策，至於如何謀取合理的平等的和平，自更為人人心頭所要求他解答的主要課題。不過就我們淺近的看法，却稍稍有所不同。我們以為何院長雖是軍人，而溫文爾雅，實在是平易近人，不像好高騖遠，也似乎不是一個任性衝動，趨於極端的人物。惟其如此，我們願牽勸何院長，與其未上台前把理想提得太高，毋甯採取現實主義，估量當前的環境，自身的力量，先把能夠兌現辦到的幾件事提出來，認真幹去。</p>
<p>也許有人以為今天中國已病入膏肓，必須下決心，服猛藥，方可挽救，所謂「若藥不瞑眩，厥疾弗瘳。」但是我們以為今天中國的病固然重極了，而這個病體也是虛極了，如何祛病固為要着，而如何扶持元氣不使虛說，尤為至急之務。假使衹為迎合時尚，聊圖快意，濫開藥方，盲目服食，深恐病未必除，命却先送。例如翁內閣時代王雲五氏長財政部之所為，至今國家猶蒙其大害。可見一個政治家之為功為罪，不當僅問其動機，且須注意其設施的效果。我們不願見何院長向立法院作施政方針的報告時，開出了許許多多花花綠綠的支票，而將來不能兌現；我們但望他很謹慎地開出一張兩張政治支票，到期却能不折不扣的兌現，一掃以往政界人物上台則大言不慚，到了則推諉責任的惡劣風氣。</p>
<p>我們所謂現實主義，並不是不要理想之謂，乃是說理想不可離現實太遠。外傳何院長有師法英國工黨所行的社會政策之意，自然好極了。但昨天何院長却說對此還沒有多大研究。這或許要使一部分人士將感失望，但我們反藉此窺見何院長的真誠。聞英國朋友曾對何院長說過，中國的法律幾乎應有盡有，若干法規或且勝於英國，特患在有法而不能行。可見今天的中國，實在不必侈談效法英國，摹仿美國，學習蘇聯，中國政治家目前所應該切實努力的，只要針對中國政治經濟以及軍事局勢的現實，如何作逐步的改革以求其進步而已。這就是我們所說甯取現實主義的真意所在。</p>
<p>老實說罷，中國今天不患沒有憑空設計的專家，也不患缺少高談闊論的橫議之士，尤其獨多見風使柁，投機取巧，朝秦暮楚，翻雲覆雨的政客。至於忠懷耿耿，大節凜然，攘利不先，赴義恐後的苦幹實幹的傻瓜，則求之今日，雖非鳳毛麟角，要已不可多得。何院長是一位久綰軍符的宿將，自非蹈空游說之士可比，又曾奉派赴美，對民主國家政治家切實負責的風度，必多耳濡目染心領神會之處，我們希望他此番出山，要認定目標，苦幹，實幹，要立志做　個不問收穫只問耕耘的大傻瓜。我們勸何院長不必同文士們去　辭華，却要憑他的忠忱與毅力，面對現實，向老百姓表示他的支票兌現的成績。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕格陵蘭戰略基地在成立强大抵抗武裝侵略之大西洋防衛網中之未來地位，十二日在美國丹麥對此大西洋公約之談商中，已有顯著之輪廓。該冰區之基地問題，巳由丹外長賴斯摩森及國務院高級官員加以討論。按照美國丹麥間一九四一年條約之規定，美國仍得在格陵蘭保有防衛基地數處。巳完成公約談判之八國正急切希望丹麥及其戰略性的大西洋殖民地，能加入彼等之防衛組織內。丹麥參加此公約，現巳真實確定，但外交界人士以為義大利將先丹麥而加入此歷史性之平時聯盟。</p>

<p>〔路透社羅馬十二日電〕義大利青年數千名，今日於衆院辯論大西洋公約之際，集於衆院附近之廣場，舉行反對大西洋公約之示威。頭戴鋼盔手持湯姆生槍及棍棒之大批警察，聞警乘吉普飛馳而至，企圖驅散羣衆，一時秩序大亂，發生鬥毆，被拘捕者多人。示威青年高聲斥責警察為法西斯份子，附近店舖迅速打烊，以防遭殃。先是義右翼社會統一黨之參議員及衆議員，在領袖薩拉迦特領導下，決定支援政府參加大西洋公約之決議。左翼社會黨領袖南尼，於衆院開始辯論大西洋公約時，則竭力抨擊，指大西洋公約為包圍蘇聯及人民民主國之一種企圖。渠又指責加斯貝利總理欲使義大利牽入戰爭，大西洋公約包含與大西洋無關之國家，不得視為聯合國制度下的區域公約，實與聯合國憲章有悖。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十三日電〕據英人可靠方面消息：白魯塞爾公約五簽字國之諮詢委員會，定明日在倫敦開會討論大西洋公約草案，將完成一真正「軍事的馬歇爾計劃」。五國之財長與國防部長亦將與會，討論此新計劃之經濟財政條款，尤其關於軍事配備品製造之經費問題。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕此間外交界人士指稱，蘇聯勢力圈內關於馬其頓問題之衝突，至本週似已更趨尖銳化。此項衝突雖僅具局部性質，但亦可能引起遠大的後果。共黨「自由希臘」電台最近宣布，巴爾幹民族聯邦制度內，不久可宣布成立由各馬其頓民族團結而成的馬其頓獨立國等語，頗引起南斯拉夫之反感。</p>
<p>此間相信莫斯科業已批准一遠期的宣傳戰及政治戰計劃，以成立馬其頓獨立國為目標。此舉將使南斯拉夫喪夫南國境內之馬其頓區，亦將使希臘北部被剝奪大片土地。莫斯科之支援此一行動，殆係由於相信希遊擊隊難成大事，而推翻狄托政權在短期內亦不可能之故。</p>
<p>〔路透社雅典十二日電〕希臘公安部長倫狄斯稱，希共曾向渠透露有聯合保加利亞·阿爾巴尼亞及希臘游擊隊以推翻狄托之陰謀，彼等認為蘇聯業已將其馬其頓政策犧牲希臘共產主義，而希共黨領袖亦已悖棄彼等之信仰。彼等目前從事之戰爭，不過遂帝國主義者之目標而已。行動計劃據云，為由潛入南塞爾維亞之希游擊隊及希臘馬其頓之斯拉夫族游擊隊，發動軍事行動，煽動馬其頓人反抗狄托。彼等相信狄托政權在此一局面下，終必趨於崩潰，於是保加利亞領導之叛軍可以長驅南下，奪取其夢魂所繋的愛琴海口薩朗尼加。</p>

<p>〔本報青島十三日電〕中航被劫客機中獲釋自濟南返青旅客名單，為：陳精文（海軍造船所長）·周家駿（青央行襄理）·周張傅璧（周之新婚夫人）·劉佐祿·牟環海·宋恕（俱為青島商人）·Josef.Kanflord（德籍神父）·W.Haealoop（德籍商人）共八人。其餘六大一小，根據返青八旅客談，證實為共方所遣之特別旅客，名單如下：李筠·陳鐵聲·劉書榮·華興杭·邢國錚·劉濟英·劉弟弟（約有兩歲），可能為化名。又據返青旅客談，彼等八人與機航人員三人於該機被劫至濟之日（三十），先至濟市府，經詢問姓名履歷後，即送至石泰顏飯店（市府招待所），分居六室，佔樓一層，失去自由，每天以打橋牌下圍棋或到院內擲鐵球消遣。三十一日共方再度派人至石泰顏詢問一次，並再度申言即可安全送返青島。九日將陳精文·周家駿夫婦帶至共黨警備司令部詢問，堅認彼等為俘虜，陳等當將（俘虜）之真正意義加以申辯，共方詢問人員（不知姓名）稱：「你們是用槍迫到濟南來的，不是俘虜是什麼」？但陳等之反覆申辯，似尙有效，彼等在共黨撫訓大隊被拘五天後，重回石泰顏飯店。</p>
<p>特別旅客顯與共方有關</p>
<p>另一可注意之事，即為當該機迫降濟南機場後，共方人員似與特別旅客至為熟識，暱呼「老俞，老俞。」（老俞係譯音）。並稱：「回來了」等語，一若致祝賀之意。次日特別旅客訪彼等於石泰顏飯店，表示不得已之歉意，諸此證明一三五號機之被刦，係共方所遣特別旅客有計劃行動，其中「老俞」似為領袖人物。據返青旅客描述被刦經過稱：當時機中坐位空敞，自駕駛室至機門座次，為特別旅客·特別旅客（女性抱小孩）·陳精文·德神父·德商。對面一排自駕駛室起，為特別旅客·特別旅客·周太太·周家駿·三青島商人，次為二特別旅客。據某青島商人稱：其座位下發現手溜彈二枚，此組特別旅客上機時，携有包裹一個，安置機尾座位旁，起飛後二十餘分鐘，周太太旁之特別旅客即被稱為「老俞」者，身瘦體長，卸去中國長袍，露出綠呢空軍制服及手槍，其餘特別旅客亦相繼發動，出現手槍，計勃浪林一支，左輪兩支，共三支。女特別旅客最為沉着，担任監視，相信伊亦有手槍藏於衣後。「老俞」以槍指旅客，聲言大家都是在外面跑跑的，不許動，動就打死你們。</p>
<p>逼副機師駕駛　降落濟南機場</p>
<p>其時駕駛室適啓門分發點心，副機師舒之倫及電訊員當被特別旅客用槍脅令不許動，並令舉手。渠等尙稱不要開玩笑，特別旅客答以誰同你開玩笑，特別旅客之一將預置機尾之包裹打開，取出飛行服裝換穿，並迅速進入駕駛室，奪取駕駛座位，遂向濟南航行。此後一段時間中，並無特殊動靜，惟「老俞」進出最為忙碌。該機抵濟南上空時，曾遭機槍射擊，但經盤旋二十餘分鐘，發現有降落意圖時，地面人員即舉揮白色巾以示風向。特別旅客令副機師駕駛着陸，舒答以無把握，須請正機師。但彼等不同意，堅令舒入內駕機，第一次未成功，第二次雖告成功，但震動頗劇，幸均安全。</p>
<p>一三五號客機　可能仍在濟南</p>
<p>返青旅客又稱：彼等在濟機場所見破損飛機零件不少，均用柴草掩蓋。一三五號機或仍在濟，空中偵察不易發現。青島所獲特別情報，未必可靠。又共方人員告彼等稱：吾人未以高射砲猛烈射擊當日低飛之中航機，因相信該機係來探訪汝等之消息者。機師旅客除閱讀與中共廣播內容一律之報紙外，對外界一切幾一無所知，惟於廢歷新年中，不斷聽得街上有秧歌隊鑼鼓聲來去。其間曾偶然遇一空軍，向彼等作自稱並非宣傳之宣傳，但即被守衛者禁止。彼等曾數度聯名函共黨濟市府，請實踐送返青島諾言，五日十時始由守衛人員宣示即該啓程，並派兵一班同行至藍村，再交於共方游擊隊引渡。共方稱，陳精文及周家駿夫婦得受與其他旅客同樣之待遇，係請示上級後所決定。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕京滬鐵路局的視察團，甫從京滬綫各大站視察歸來，記者昨天得到了消息，便作了次個別訪問，探聽了些沿綫近况，和這條大動脈經過「疏散」，「軍運」二次大病後的情况。</p>
<p>京滬鐵路巡視團，包括路局警務處處長錢鶴皋，副處長黃德熙，運務處副處長劉世中，專員彭鳳崗等四人。他們首先到蘇州。蘇州市容尙不失天堂本色，從南京及對江過來避難的商民及在局勢最混亂時期內從鎮江遷來的省政府公務人員眷屬，造成了蘇州的畸形繁榮。</p>
<p>蘇州房荒嚴重</p>
<p>最近駐軍一天天的增加，所有廟宇，祠堂和比較寬大的院落，差不多都已住滿了兵與軍屬，於是房荒越來越嚴重了。虎丘，獅子林的遊客，也獨多軍人。效區治安頗成問題，曾經接連發生過事故，木瀆，靈岩，天平山已無人去玩，巡視團於公餘想嚐嚐石家飯店的名餚，竟也沒有實現。</p>
<p>第二天到達無錫。在目前京滬沿綫中，無錫可算得首屈一指了，市面好，治安好，工商業繁榮，市內難得見到軍隊，鼋头渚，五里湖，梅園，　園，惠山，依然使人留戀。線粉，百葉，肉麵筋與開洋豆腐花，還是那樣美味可口。他們正期待着上海春遊仕女們的來臨。</p>
<p>常州遍地皆兵，清凉寺天寗寺兩大古剎，不再是晨鐘暮鼓的佛地。商業也十分萎縮。因為長江封鎖之後，與蘇北的貿易已告停頓，商品呆滯，市容蕭條。鎮江為省府所在地，一切顯得有秩序，有紀律，雖然一度因省政府遷移，發生過混亂，現在早回復了。惟一憾事，是焦山，象山，甘露寺等名勝區都在江防封鎖區內，遊客不得其門而入。金山雖仍開放，遊客寥寥，金山寺去歲慘遭回騄，只剩下一片瓦礫塲，供人憑弔。駐軍實力雄厚，約有一個軍，江防鞏固，治安無虞。</p>
<p>南京僅剩空殼</p>
<p>南京經過這次大疏散後，已祗剩下一個空壳，政院各部會，仍在廣州辦公，部裏的剩餘傢具，作成了倫兒。這幾天立法院復會，立委因家眷什九離京，給中央飯店做了不少生意。夫子廟上座約四五成，下關新車站的國際飯店已結束，站上餐室一度停頓，現已恢復，且生意不惡，座上客大都是軍人。徐淮戰役中突圍國軍，每天仍有陸續渡江歸來。各地情况還算安定，人民對戰爭已不若以前敏感與恐怖，各處唯一相同的地方，是到處可聞叮噹銀元之聲。</p>
<p>北站職員記憶中　兩幅不同的畫面</p>
<p>鐵路本身的業務，說來悽慘，往年這個時候，那一班火車上不擠滿了春遊旅客，而今却冷清清一點消息都沒有，兩路職工正為生意清淡在發愁。京滬路的主要收入靠客運，貨運不過佔三分之一。去年春天是他們的黃金時代，兩路旅客每天平均達廿二萬，近幾天他們做了個統計，每天全路的旅客僅僅五萬人左右。北站的一位職員，對記者說：「去年這時，我們一天到夜忙得喘不過氣來，親戚·朋友·團體的·私人的·託買車票，摩肩接踵。北站也擠滿了漂亮的仕女。現在你看看。擠雖仍是那麼擠，可是，春遊的仕女，已換上了軍隊和難民。在他記憶中，顯出了兩幅完全不同的畫面，大有不堪回首話當年的神態。</p>

<p>決定推代表晋京請願</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各國立專科以上學校自費學生，近因物價飛漲，無力繳納膳費，紛紛要求全面公費，已由同濟·交通·復旦·暨南·音專·上海商學院及唐山工學院等校組織上海市國立大專學校自費半自費同學聯合會。據統計全市國立大專學校自費生共有二千八百名左右，該會經集商後，已決定推派代表，於日內晋京向李代總統請願，要求將華北各校之公費名額撥給本市各校自費生。</p>
<p>據該會表示，現下本市各校自費生之膳食，以交大為例，二月份共繳九百餘元，至本月份已需七千四百六十元。各自費同學有因家鄉受戰事影響，接濟斷絕，有因家長為公務員，所得低微，家庭生計尙難維持，有因家鄉物價低廉，以糧食變賣後，轉匯來滬，遭受極大貶值損失，故生活均極困苦。過去彼等尙依賴擔任家庭敎師·擦皮鞋·賣報·變賣舊衣物·舉行活命大拍賣等等，想盡方法支撐維持，而今因物價瘋狂上漲，認為已至山窮水盡無法再予忍耐之時，為求生存，堅決要求全面公費，按物價指數發給公費。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕滬警籃球隊昨晚遭逢首次空前之慘敗，以五十二比二十八大敗於麥令斯，上半時麥令斯以十八比十五佔先三分。上場初戰，滬警尚能跟進，二十分鐘完畢，勉强輸了三分。下半時麥令斯光芒萬丈，一次連得十一分之多，滬警防綫，全部崩潰。麥令在第一循環中每戰皆北，但每一次進步一次，終於報復了滬警第一循環之辱。麥令身材高大，昨晚聯絡之純熟，動作之敏速，投籃之準確，千餘觀衆，同時讚好，滬警一無辦法。並且用同樣戰法來對付，快，速，衝，和高球來去，於是陷入了他們的圈套中，脫不了出來。以昨晚麥令之兇狠，其餘各隊來對付，都有些吃力。後衛利斯，人高，投籃準；前鋒萊姆山，一搭一擋，無孔不入。下半時滬警無一不改變陣容，終於沒有藥救，分數愈打愈脫節。這一場比賽，與其說是滬警的不景氣，毋寗說是麥令的特別精彩。</p>
<p>昨晚女子組比賽綠隊再勝約翰，六十二比十五分，上半時綠隊三十，約翰二分。甲二B組回力B勝郵電，五二比三十八，上半時二十九比十一。</p>

<p>下半時開始，哥弗萊利斯等威風不減，廿三比十七，梁永標替何增，一瞬間廿九比十七，滬警連輸十一分，麥令小孩子萊姆山的穿楊妙技，令人五體投地。卅一比十七，何增其俠入，蓉生久全出，敵勢依然壓不住，卅七比廿四蓉生替久全，伯文永標也一隻隻的投進，卅九比廿八蓉生五次犯規，久全代戰，此後的殘局過去，五七比四二，麥令斯大聲啦啦。</p>

<p>星洲羽球冠軍黃炳順之手臂，突然受傷，不能為馬來亞隊効勞，出席在布里士敦之湯杯決賽，使本坡人士惋惜不置，尤以黃炳順夫人為甚。據黃夫人談，炳順每次來函，皆未談及他事，僅謂，身體壯健，其最近之一切來信，乃二月十二日寄發，亦謂一切皆佳，余之丈夫有一抱負，乃欲將美國之費禮門擊敗，在其信上尚謂，欲與丹麥之史洛一較勝負，現時渠已不能作戰，恐亦不能出席全英羽球冠軍比賽，余相信渠必感失望，當然吾人在此間亦感失望也。</p>
<p>記者指出黃炳順於獲知手臂不適時，退出不與費禮門週旋，當屬智舉，黃夫人答稱，當然，但君不知炳順之個性，渠乃一倔强之人，在比賽中，不論其身論如何受傷，渠從來不半途而廢，直至最後為止，故雖在手臂不適中，渠亦必竭力企圖擊敗費禮門。</p>

<h3 id="c83">渡江之謎 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派員凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江十二日訊〕萬里長江，今天不單純是政府恃之為備戰謀和的一條生命綫，實際上，它已經成為決定中國四億伍千萬人民的命運今後將走向那一條路的指標。自然，和平，民主，是國共雙方所一向揭舉着的口號，然而如何地把中國引上和平民主之路，祥和的，或者是流血的，長江在這裏有它的決定性。</p>
<p>中共要過江，是事實，政府要守長江，也是事實。因此，「渡江不渡江？」成為朝野上下任何人所最關切的問題。</p>
<p>軍事會議　議定計劃</p>
<p>這是一個沒有證實的消息：共軍在二月間在中原某地，召開了一個軍事會議，會中除決定了陳賡·陳毅分任東西綫兵團司令員而外，並且就渡江行動擬定了一個初步計劃，這計劃是陳毅在安慶以下一段過江，着重鎮江蕪湖兩點，攻佔京滬後，將直下杭州。陳賡率領西綫兵團，從沙（市）宜（昌）過江，然後向粵漢路迂迴。中央兵團則以林彪部為主力，於擊潰武漢外圍的國軍後，沿粵漢路南指長沙，與西綫的陳賡取得聯絡，再行截斷浙贛路西窺九江，並將與攻杭州的陳毅部相互呼應。這僅僅是一個計劃而已，其正確性研究有多少，還待未來的事實證明。</p>
<p>假定以這個計劃為觀點來看共軍的全面渡江攻勢吧，自然在林彪部沒有大量南下之時，無法見諸行動，國防部通報說林部第三·第五兩縱隊，已到達鄭州以南地區，鄧文儀局長在上海還說這個情報尙待證實，顯然，在平漢路中段的孤島—新鄉未被吃，平漢交通有待打通，以及濟南大鐵橋沒有修好，津浦路還不能直達行車以前，林彪部大量南下，交通上也還有相當困難。何况在平漢南段，江漢與大別山之間，白健生將軍還統率着數十萬大軍，坐鎮武漢，共軍對華中地區的國軍，固有眼中釘之感，但在部署與準備沒有成熟之前，也決不能貿然動手。</p>
<p>長江下游　兵力控制</p>
<p>長江上游，山高嶺峻。江流湍急，四川總還算是一片乾淨土，不必有多大的顧慮。長江中游，沙宜以下，安慶以上，儘管有江漢地區可以做渡江的跳板，但是幾十萬雄兵勁旅，雲集其間，渡江之前，必得有塲惡戰。因此，今天大家所注視到的，將是安慶以下這一段江面。在這一段的江北岸，國軍僅控制了少數幾座的橋頭堡陣地，大部份江面都暴露在共軍的面前。</p>
<p>守江必先守淮，這幾乎是自古及今相傳不二的守江原則，儘管有了海軍的支持，在江北作戰，背水為陣的顧慮可以减輕不少，然而政府軍事當局如果要在長江下游北岸，控制一片近一千里長的狹長地帶，那就需要一個很可觀的兵力。國軍要守牢南通，泰縣，揚州，六合，滁縣，全椒，巢縣，廬江這一綫，其困難并不下於守淮。蚌埠之撤守，軍方就已沉痛地決定把下游江防維持成今天的局面，因為徐蚌一戰，國軍所受的敎訓太大了。</p>
<p>敵前渡江　談何容易</p>
<p>長江以北，平漢路以東，這一片江淮大平原是整個地插上了紅色的旗幟了，從地形上看，共產黨是可能不會放棄這一塊過江的跳板的。在江北，河流交叉，利於控制船隻，運用船隻，在江南，三山地區的土共一向就很活躍，他們可以把對着南京的津浦鐵路做中央進兵之綫，而以對着鎮江的運河綫，和對着蕪湖的淮南鐵路作為左右進兵的道路，用這三條運輸大動脈，他們可以集中兵力在某一個時期「敵前渡江」也許是偷渡，利用土共的策應，在江南佔領幾個橋頭堡，然後慢慢擴展，以造成「直取南京」的最直接的威脅。</p>
<p>可是，「敵前渡江」，談何容易？而對着國軍在江南第一綫江防陣地佈就的四十萬以上的雄師，再加上海空軍的配合，共軍是不能不作深長的考慮的。戰術的改變，（因為用人海戰術來填長江是不可能的），運輸工具的籌劃，船隻的控制，糧秣的準備，這一切都還是共軍所日夜深思熟籌的課題。</p>
<p>共軍調動　異常忙碌</p>
<p>目前長江下游北岸的共軍，調兵遣將，異常忙碌。陳毅部的十八個縱隊，原來都駐在津浦南段兩側，經過調動以後，目前在津浦南段剩下了第一，第四，第十三，新八等縱隊，合肥附近駐有第六，七（一部），新五，新六等縱隊和第三十七軍，七縱隊的一部和第三十五軍在滸縣和巢縣一帶，津浦路東天長盱眙之間，有第二，三，及渤海，快速等四個縱隊。蘇北原來只有長江縱隊，分兩部駐在南通，靖江兩地，南通是一〇四，一〇五，一〇六，三個團，靖江黃橋間為一〇一，一〇二，一〇三，三個團。從本月初起，原來在兩淮地區的第十，十一，十二等三個縱隊，沿運河南下，分別抵達如皋，泰縣，揚州，三地，另外還有空軍在通榆綫上發現的一部共軍，約二萬餘人，一週前，這一部的行動方向是東台，最近據情報，第九縱隊已經調來蘇北，位置在揚，泰之間，而九，十，兩縱隊，復於十日起開始東移，原在如皋的十一縱隊呢，已調至如皋以南地區。根據軍方的情報和判斷，共軍東移和目標，可能是南通啓東一帶，有威脅崇明島的企圖。此外，共軍第十兵團許世友的司令部，已經可能調駐淮陰，這因為第九，十，十一，十二，和兩廣等五個縱隊，歸許指揮，現在，九，十，十一，十二，四個縱隊，都已經證實在蘇北，而兩廣縱隊也證實了已開抵淮陰，則許世友之來蘇北，自然是很可能的事實。</p>
<p>陳兵江岸　圖增壓力</p>
<p>共軍的脚步，一步步地逼近江邊，面對着江北共軍的砲口，和南京的政治舞台上的低氣壓，江南人心惶惶，誰不為「渡江」問題担心？共軍在蘇北調動的企圖，就一般的看法，不外兩點：（一）移調新地點補充，以求迅速。（二）陳兵江岸，威脅京滬，俾在和談中能進一步地對政府施以予取予求的壓力。就軍事觀點上看，共軍對「渡江」是不會貿然出之的，更何况中共對「和談」尙在半推半就之間·和談未破裂以前，中共似不會展開大規模的軍事行動，來讓「破壞和談」的帽子加到自己的頭上來的。</p>
<p>脫節現象　令人焦慮</p>
<p>假使我們不否認共軍有「渡江」的企圖，那麼我們對目前的共軍調動頻繁，以及在各地征糧征草，製造船隻……這一切事實不必過份緊張，共軍要過江，自然得該準備一番，不過準備是一回事，準備否已經到達所需要的程度又是一回事。今天，不管從純軍事的立場，或者從政治的立場看共軍的「渡江」，不但尙需待以時日，而且如無特別變化，共軍也不會把渡江這件事看得太空容易。可是聽聽目前軍事將領們高唱「備戰謀和」之際，各地的民意機構却已大張停止征粮征役的旗號，江南還是一片脫節，眼看着經濟危機的嚴重，政治空氣的低沉，而江南的土共却在那裏日長夜大，這倒是令人揑一把冷汗。</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 13th] He Yingqin and his wife were originally scheduled to return to Nanjing this morning on the 'Zhuiyun' special plane dispatched by Acting President Li, but due to deteriorating weather conditions today, they changed their travel arrangements and took a special train at 8:50 AM via the Lianglu Railway to Shanghai to return to Nanjing. Sun Lianzhong, Leng Xin, Chen Jicheng, and others traveled with them. Those who came to the station to see them off included Zhou Lei, Peng Zhaoxian, Zhang Qiang, Xuan Tiewu, Yu Jimin, and others.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The newly appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan, General He Yingqin, arrived in Shanghai yesterday noon by special train from Hangzhou. He will stay here for a day or two to exchange views with the leaders of the People's Party and the Youth Party on the current situation, and to invite them to join the new cabinet to jointly support the precarious situation. He expressed that it would be especially welcome if peace representatives from Shanghai, such as Yen Hui-ching and others, could accept the invitation to join the cabinet. Premier He and his family departed from Hangzhou at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, accompanied by Sun Lianzhong, Chen Jicheng, Jiang Dingwen, and others. The train arrived at the Fanhuangdu West Station at 12:45 PM. More than ten municipal leaders who went to welcome them included Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, and Director Mao. A press conference was held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and at around 4:00 PM, Premier He attended a symposium with members of the Central Committee staying in Shanghai at the City Bank. Those who attended included Fang Zhi, Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Gu Zhenggang, Liu Gongyun, Zhao Dihua, Cheng Cangbo, Hu Jianzhong, Zhang Fang, Zhang Zhiben, Liu Duoquan, and more than twenty others.

Yesterday, He met with Zhang Qun, Gu Zhenggang, Xu Kan, and others at his residence, and held separate discussions with them. Premier He issued the following written statement: "This time, I am grateful for Acting President Li's nomination and the Legislative Yuan's trust in entrusting me with the task of forming a cabinet. I am aware of my limited abilities and fear that I will not be able to fulfill the task. However, the situation is difficult and dangerous, and all difficult problems need to be resolved. I will go to Nanjing within the next few days to exchange views with all parties, hoping to gather talented people and jointly plan national affairs, and to use the spirit of unity and innovation to seek political improvement and the realization of peace." In addition, He also gave oral answers to the questions raised by reporters, stating briefly that the list of the new cabinet has not yet been finalized and will be made after exchanging views with all parties. He will stay in Shanghai for several days to invite the People's Party and the Youth Party to join the new cabinet. He also stated that after the establishment of the new cabinet, he hopes that peace talks and political reform can be carried out simultaneously. However, he stated that he has not yet studied the rumor that the British Labour Party system would be adopted. He did not give a definite answer to the issue of demobilization and the number to be retained, which is of concern to the public, only saying that if peace can be achieved, all problems can be easily solved.</p>

<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 12th] Chen Lifu, accompanied by his wife and secretary, arrived in Taipei at 5:30 AM on the 12th.

However, I served as the plenipotentiary representative for negotiations with the Communists before the war. At that time, both sides had already signed an agreement. If this agreement could be strictly observed, today's events would not have happened at all, and there would have been no need for the Political Consultative Conference three years ago."

<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 12th] It is reported that most Chinese and foreign shipping companies here still maintain a tentative or wait-and-see attitude towards the resumption of transportation and trade with Tianjin and other ports under Communist control. Because the Communist authorities lack a concrete trade policy, most companies here can only send exploratory ships to Tianjin and Yantai. The ships scheduled to sail to Tianjin on the 12th include the 'Grant' and the 'Oriental Merchant'. The former is 1,800 tons and the latter is 1,000 tons. The 'Hunan' will also sail to Tianjin recently. Merchants here hope to learn what materials the Communist side is willing to exchange.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Beiping Type (II) <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Xue</p>
<p>(A report on a city before and after "local peace")</p>
<p>It is said that when Changchun and Shenyang in the Northeast were abandoned, Mao Zedong sent a representative to Beiping to explore peace talks with Fu Zuoyi, hoping to resolve the North China issue through political means. This representative stayed in Beiping for more than ten days, but did not receive a concrete answer from Fu Zuoyi, and left in disappointment. After the Communist army surrounded Beiping and Tianjin, the Communist army used a broadcasting offensive to urge Fu Zuoyi and commanders at all levels to send representatives to negotiate. Zhou Beifeng once represented Fu Zuoyi to leave the city to make contact. But at that time, Chahar Province had not yet been lost. Fu was confident that he could still fight, and was not eager to seek peace. Later, because of the loss of Chahar Province, the main force was completely lost. Military force is the political capital of soldiers. When the strength is gone, they have to consider the next step, and then send Deng Baoshan and Zhou Beifeng out of the city to make contact. After the end of the Tianjin battle, Beiping was completely isolated. In addition, the defeat of the Huaihai Campaign caused Nanjing's political market to decline day by day. Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian in Central China also had a series of contacts, which prompted Fu Zuoyi's determination to negotiate peace, and the undercurrent of peace talks was concretely and actively underway.</p>
<p>On the other side of the undercurrent of peace talks was the social peace movement initiated by prominent figures. For example, four senators from Tianjin left the city to negotiate peace. Before the peace talks yielded results, the Tianjin battle had ended. Many celebrities and scholars in Beiping also called for peace to preserve the ancient capital's cultural relics. There was an organization called the Peace Promotion Association. Fu Zuoyi also repeatedly invited professors from universities in Beiping to solicit their opinions on peace. There was also an episode in which He Siyuan, the former mayor of Beiping, flew from Nanjing to Beiping, vigorously promoting the peace movement, and became a news figure for a while, but received two time bombs as the price. Fortunately, the bomb on his wife's roof exploded first. He ran to his wife's room after hearing the explosion, resulting in the death of his second child, and he, his wife, and his children were all injured. If the bomb on his own roof had exploded first, he might have lost his life! However, He Siyuan was not discouraged by this, and still participated in the peace delegation with injuries to make contact with the Communist army outside the city. During this negotiation, He Siyuan vigorously defended Fu Zuoyi's thoughts and actions, and had a debate with the Communist army personnel, but returned without any concrete results. In fact, these actions were just superficial gestures or affectations, and the actual decisions were still being made in secret.</p>
<p>Deng Baoshan and Zhou Beifeng, dressed in civilian clothes, met with Lin Biao, Nie Rongzhen, and Ye Jianying of the Communist army, and negotiated concrete solutions. But Fu Zuoyi still wanted to see how the overall situation in the country was changing, and whether the Central Government had better solutions to offer. So he delayed and did not announce or resolve to implement it. The Communists criticized Fu Zuoyi for lacking courage, saying that he had no courage at all. Since the President issued the New Year's Day message, to the end of the defeat of the Huaihai War, the Yangtze River was in danger, and the unconditional armistice was announced, Nanjing's political market plummeted. After Fu Zuoyi received the news that President Chiang had decided to telegraph his resignation, he also decided to accept the Communist army's terms for local peace and announced that he would implement them. This was Fu Zuoyi's painstaking effort, because this approach seemed very acceptable to Mr. Chiang and the Central Government.</p>
<p>On the evening of January 22, the spokesperson of the North China Pacification Headquarters formally announced the thirteen key points of the Beiping local peace plan, the main points of which were: (1) The National Army in the city will withdraw to designated locations outside the city and be reorganized within one month; the Communist army will also withdraw thirty miles. (2) The provincial and municipal governments will continue to perform their duties as usual, pending reorganization. (3) A joint office will be established to handle all relevant matters between the two parties. (4) The Gold Yuan Certificate will continue to be used. (5) The safety of life for public and education personnel will be guaranteed. (6) Postal and telecommunications agencies will continue to operate as usual. (7) Newspapers, news agencies, and propaganda agencies will continue to publish and re-register. (8) The safety of people's lives and property will be guaranteed. (9) People have freedom of religious belief. ... etc. According to what the Communist army said after entering the city, the contents of these key points are not very complete. However, after these thirteen key points were announced, public and education personnel and the public seemed to have taken a reassurance pill and felt relieved! Everyone was glad that Beiping could avoid the disaster of artillery fire, and that individuals could be guaranteed the safety of their lives and property, so they continued to live their lives as usual. As for political gains and losses, and how the future will change, of course, they will consider it in the next step.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, when the news of the realization of local peace in Beiping spread, prices once plummeted. Silver dollars fell to 180 Gold Yuan Certificates per dollar, and each bag of flour for military ships was only worth three silver dollars. However, after the newspapers published the thirteen key points on the morning of the 23rd, prices continued to rise and gradually returned to their original state.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The primary task of He Yingqin's new cabinet is obviously to continue peace talks with the CCP. According to Shao Lizi, a peace talk representative, who told reporters on the 13th, the departure date of the delegation can be determined by the new cabinet after consulting with the Communist Party on the date of the start of the peace talks. At the same time, it also urges the Communist Party to send representatives as soon as possible. In addition, regarding the peace talk representatives appointed by the government, some have repeatedly requested to resign, but the government has not yet appointed new candidates as of now.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 13th] Most independent and qualified observers here believe that the result of He Yingqin's nomination as the new Prime Minister may hardly improve the prospects for peace between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Due to He Yingqin's past relationship with former President Chiang, they believe that He's future task is actually to prevent Acting President Li from making major concessions to the Communist Party and to hold peace negotiations based on Mao Zedong's eight conditions. The general opinion here does not doubt Acting President Li's sincerity in seeking peace to end the civil war, but is deeply afraid that his declaration in Nanjing on the 11th, which was extremely confident about peace, is in fact groundless. He Yingqin's power is based on the generals and provincial governors, but this force is insufficient to re-establish a common front when the expected peace negotiations are held with the Communist Party. Most people also expressed doubts about He's military talent and whether he can inspire morale if the government decides to reject the CCP's demands.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] According to reliable sources, it was revealed to reporters on the 13th that the CCP is currently trying to divide the government in order to achieve the goal of individual breakthroughs. It is said that the CCP is currently targeting Acting President Li as the object of peace talks, and has expressed its willingness to agree to Li and Bai Chongxi participating in the joint government structure after future "comprehensive peace." However, it firmly insists on adopting a mixed formation for the garrison issue in the Nanjing-Shanghai area under "comprehensive peace." The person also stated to reporters that the CCP intends to adopt a divisive policy to unite with Acting President Li in order to attack President Chiang. However, Acting President Li was not moved by this intention after learning about it. Judging from the recent political developments, the close unity between Chiang and Li makes it difficult for the CCP to achieve its goal of division.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] More than a month has passed since Acting President Li took office. During this period, it has been repeatedly rumored that there seemed to be some misunderstandings or misinterpretations between Chiang and Li. On the 13th, a highly authoritative person in the government told reporters that Zhang Zhizhong's trip to Fenghua this time has made the party and the government's internal unity closer between President Chiang and Acting President Li. The person expressed great satisfaction with this.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] According to reliable sources, the retired President Chiang has decided to leave Xikou and move to Gulangyu to stay for a while in the next few days. However, it is not yet known whether he will return to Xikou after going to Gulangyu.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 13th] Zhang Zhizhong told a newspaper reporter on the 13th that President Chiang told him that he would withdraw from politics within five years and give Acting President Li full authority to govern. Zhang continued to say that Chiang "apologetically" talked about his past political failures, so he has no intention of getting involved in politics again. However, Zhang Zhizhong also said that Chiang is a revolutionary and will continue to lead the Kuomintang to devote himself to revolutionary work. He said that President Chiang is closely watching the reform of the Kuomintang, strengthening the party's organization and restoring the party's revolutionary spirit. Zhang also said that President Chiang has gained eight pounds since his retirement, from 118 pounds to 126 pounds. He added that President Chiang is in good spirits and goes hiking every day.</p>

<h3 id="e16">The Communist Army Has 300,000 Troops in Northern Jiangsu and Central Anhui: It Is Rumored That Lin Biao's Troops Have Passed Through Xuzhou and Gone South <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Chen Yi's East China Field Army has apparently placed its main force in the area north of the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu and central Anhui as of today. Although the Communist Party has also advocated seeking peace for the past two months, it has actually been working hard to reorganize and gradually move south in the areas south of the Yellow River that it occupies. In addition to the ten-odd columns of the Central Plains Field Army commanded by Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi's First to Twelfth Columns, plus the three new Fourth, Seventh, and Eighth Columns formed by upgrading militia, plus the four columns of Rapid, Liangguang, Bohai, and Yangtze, totaling 19 columns, numbering about 300,000 people, have gathered in the areas of Jingjiang, Yangzhou, Liangtai, and Wuwei and Hexian. It was once rumored in Nanjing on the 12th that there were Communist troops drinking water on the Jiangxin Island in Tangjiagou, Wuwei, and that the sentries on the south bank of the Yangtze River shot at them. The military here is also summarizing and determining the detailed locations of each column. If the Communist army believes that "negotiators can negotiate, and those preparing for war can go to war," then the Communist army's work of approaching the north bank of the Yangtze River for the past two months can be said to have been completed. The second step is to destroy the bridgehead garrison on the north bank of the Yangtze River from Huaining in the west to the port in the east. As of tonight, there have been no changes in the situation of the bridgeheads on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and everything is very peaceful. However, the isolated Jiangbei strongholds, which are 600 kilometers long and have their backs to the water, have extremely arduous tasks for the officers and soldiers, and their mood is particularly heavy. Although it is rumored in Nanjing that Lin Biao's troops have already passed through Xuzhou and gone south, and that Chen Yi's troops will prepare to cross the Yangtze River in full force after March 20, all of these depend on the development of the battle for the bridgeheads on the entire northern Jiangxi line in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 13th] According to unconfirmed reports on the 13th, three to five columns of Lin Biao's troops arrived in Xuzhou. It has been repeatedly rumored in the past week that Lin Biao's troops have gone south, but Deng Wenyi, a military spokesman for the government, told reporters on the 10th that he had not received any information that could confirm or deny this rumor. If the above rumors are true, it will be a greater military pressure on the National Government, which may affect future peace talks.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Editorial: It is Better to Take a Realistic Approach <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>—Regarding Our Hopes for President He—</p>
<p>General He Yingqin has been nominated as the third Premier of the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution and was successfully approved by a majority of 209 votes in the Legislative Yuan on the 12th. People from both the government and the public believe that at this time and place, the person who can assist Acting President Li and support the precarious situation, and who is qualified to be the premier, is none other than General He. As the ancients said, "If this person does not come forth, what will happen to the people?" The popular support that General He enjoys today is no less than that of the sages of the past.</p>
<p>Although General He has not yet taken up his new post as Premier of the Executive Yuan, during his stay at West Lake to celebrate his birthday, he was urged by Acting President Li and persuaded by friends from all sides, and he should accept the appointment. After arriving in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday afternoon, he attended a symposium of Central Committee members of the Kuomintang who remained in Shanghai to exchange views and will visit prominent figures to listen to public opinion. At the same time, he will seek the participation of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party in the new cabinet. This alone shows that General He is modest and knows that his appointment at this time is arduous, and he must give serious consideration to policy decisions and the selection of cabinet members.</p>
<p>On the eve of General He's formation of the new cabinet, President Chiang personally wrote the eight characters "Our safety depends on you, let us share the hardships" as a birthday greeting for his sixtieth birthday. Everyone knows that in the past, the founding father Sun Yat-sen had written for President Chiang the couplet "Our safety in the future will depend on you, let us share the hardships when they come." Today, General He receives these eight characters from the retiring President Chiang, which shows that Mr. Chiang has high hopes for General He, almost like Mr. Sun's expectations of Mr. Chiang in those years. General He's acceptance of the mandate from Acting President Li further indicates that his life is tied to the safety of the nation and that he will share its joys and sorrows, without having to wait for the future.</p>
<p>Premier He issued a written statement yesterday, saying that he will strive for political improvement and the realization of peace with the spirit of unity and innovation. Although the words are simple, the meaning is profound. However, the earnest expectations of all parties for Premier He cannot be satisfied by these few words. When it comes to military affairs, everyone hopes that he will reorganize the army; when it comes to politics, everyone hopes that he will reduce the size of government agencies; when it comes to economics, everyone especially hopes that he will implement social policies based on the Principle of People's Livelihood. As for how to seek reasonable and equal peace, it is naturally the main question that everyone wants him to answer. However, in our humble opinion, we have a slightly different view. We believe that although Premier He is a military man, he is gentle and refined, very approachable, not one to aim too high, and does not seem to be an impulsive or extreme character. Because of this, we would like to advise Premier He that instead of setting too high an ideal before taking office, it is better to adopt a realistic approach, assess the current environment and one's own strength, and first propose a few things that can be fulfilled and done, and then work hard to achieve them.</p>
<p>Some people may think that today's China is terminally ill and must be determined to take strong medicine to save it, as the saying goes, "If the medicine does not cause dizziness, the disease will not be cured." However, we believe that although China's illness today is extremely serious, the body is also extremely weak. How to eliminate the disease is important, but how to support the vital energy so that it does not weaken is even more urgent. If we only cater to the fashion, seek momentary pleasure, prescribe prescriptions indiscriminately, and take them blindly, we are afraid that the disease may not be cured, but life may be lost first. For example, what Wang Yunwu did as the Minister of Finance during the Weng Cabinet era is still causing great harm to the country today. It can be seen that the merit or demerit of a politician should not only be judged by his motives but also by the effect of his measures. We do not want to see Premier He issue many colorful checks when he reports his administrative policies to the Legislative Yuan but be unable to cash them in the future. We only hope that he will very cautiously issue one or two political checks and be able to cash them in full when they are due, sweeping away the bad habit of political figures in the past who spoke boastfully when they took office but shirked their responsibilities when they arrived.</p>
<p>What we call realism does not mean that we do not want ideals, but that ideals should not be too far from reality. It is rumored that Premier He intends to follow the social policies of the British Labour Party, which is naturally excellent. But yesterday, Premier He said that he had not done much research on this. This may disappoint some people, but we can see Premier He's sincerity through this. We have heard British friends say to Premier He that China's laws are almost all-encompassing, and some regulations may even be better than those in Britain, but the problem is that they cannot be implemented. It can be seen that today's China does not need to talk about emulating Britain, imitating the United States, or learning from the Soviet Union. What Chinese politicians should be earnestly striving for at present is to make gradual reforms to seek progress, focusing on the reality of China's political, economic, and military situation. This is the true meaning of what we call "it is better to take a realistic approach."</p>
<p>To be honest, China today does not lack experts who design in the air, nor does it lack those who engage in high-sounding talk, especially those politicians who are opportunistic, speculative, fickle, and who manipulate the situation. As for those who are loyal, upright, unselfish, and eager to do their duty, the hardworking and practical fools, although not as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, are not easy to find today. Premier He is a veteran who has long held military power and cannot be compared to those who engage in empty talk. He was also sent to the United States and must have been influenced by the earnest and responsible demeanor of politicians in democratic countries. We hope that he will come out of retirement this time, identify his goals, work hard, be practical, and be determined to be a big fool who does not ask for harvest but only for cultivation. We advise Premier He not to compete with scholars in rhetoric but to use his loyalty and perseverance to face reality and show the people the results of his checks being cashed.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Kunming, 13th dispatch] Kunming security agencies recently cracked a conspiracy by a spy organization to riot. The case is tortuous, the organization is complex and large. The main culprits, Wang Jinlin (female), Li Faxiang, Zhang Guixian (female), Zhao Guangyu, Chen Huilin, Liang Qizhong, Zhang Jinyu (female), Hu Chaopin and others, were arrested one after another in the downtown Zhuji Street and Xiangyun Street.

However, the matter was not kept secret and was exposed. The eight criminals have been transferred to the Security Department for strict handling and will continue to interrogate the accomplices.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Arrests in Beiping Continue Uninterrupted: Kuomintang Members and Others are All Targets <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Remarks by a legislator after fleeing to the capital</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 13th dispatch] A certain legislator who had just fled from Beiping has arrived in Nanjing. According to his statement to reporters, the arrest work by the CCP authorities in Beiping is actually still in progress, but only the arrests of Xu Huidong and Zhang Yinwu have been announced. According to what he knew, Tan Zheng, the Public Security Bureau Chief sent by the CCP, had ordered all the police officers of the former police bureau to be retained, but ordered those who were retained to arrest one to five people each within three months to show their loyalty to the new regime. The targets of the arrests included seven types of people: Kuomintang members, Youth Party members, Democratic Socialist Party members, military intelligence personnel, military police, and scattered soldiers. Therefore, the arrest work has never been interrupted. Each police district has a "re-education center," where those arrested are first sent for detention, and then their whereabouts are unknown. When he fled from Beiping in mid-February, he was almost arrested. Regarding the arrest of Zhang Yinwu, according to what he knew, it was because Zhang's Si Cun Middle School had implemented military training during the War of Resistance and participated in guerrilla warfare. Therefore, it had more than 200 rifles. After the Communist army entered the city, Zhang was afraid of trouble, so he handed them all over. Unexpectedly, the Communist side said that Zhang had more than a thousand rifles and forced him to hand over another 800. Zhang could not comply, so he was arrested. In fact, the reason for Zhang's arrest was an "old grudge," because during the War of Resistance, the Communist side said that Zhang was a "friction expert." As for the foreign電 report that more than 10,000 military police in Beiping were missing, and the Communist side published a notice to find them, the truth is that all the officers and soldiers of the 19th Regiment of Military Police stationed in Beiping were incorporated into the 13th Army and 16th Army by Fu Zuoyi during the "peaceful" surrender. Only a small number who were unwilling to compromise either hid or fled. Therefore, the seven types of people arrested by the Communist side also included military police. The Beiping garrison was nominally reorganized by the Communist army and transferred, but in fact, the unity of the various units was extremely strong, and the Communist personnel had not been able to infiltrate them. The officers in command of each unit were still the old ones. The Communist side provided millet as rations, but they mostly hailed from the South and found it difficult to swallow, so they refused. The Communist side had no choice but to provide rice, because their strength was strong, and the Communist side was afraid of causing other changes, so they were very afraid of them.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Changsha, 13th dispatch] Turmoil in Hunan is widespread, with crises lurking everywhere. Although the situation in Yuanling has temporarily calmed down, many others are following suit. In the triangle area of Huaihua, Yuping, and Wugang, "heroes" are rising in large numbers. It has been reported here that Yin Liyan (graduate of the Army University) in Jiangkou, Wugang, calls himself the "Commander of the Southwest Column" and has more than 1,000 men. Xiang Chengzhu in Longtan, Xupu, calls himself the "Division Commander of the 14th Column of the Ministry of National Defense" and is recruiting troops. Zhang Yulin, who has fallen into Chenxi, is still in the area between Xupu and Chenxi, claiming to have four divisions, and is bargaining with the government. The bandit leader Li Dongsheng is leading his men to harass Huaihua, and the Fuhai County Government has moved to Yushawan. Liu Kai, the chief of the battalion in Dongkou, Wugang, led a police mutiny on the evening of the 9th. The most worrying hidden danger is Wu Hengliang, the current deputy commander of the 8th District Security, who is now in Yongshui. There have been rumors of instability. Wu is a Miao leader with more than 10,000 men, and if he takes any action, it will be alarming. There is much criticism of the authorities' policy of suppression and appeasement. Chen Kun, a provincial senator, said: "Appeasing the gentry bandits and suppressing the people" has become a famous saying quoted by newspapers.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Changsha, 13th dispatch] The troops of the First Army Group under Chen Mingren have stationed themselves in Wugang and Dongkou, which is expected to alleviate the turmoil in that area.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Changsha, 13th dispatch] Although the rebel people in Yuanling have withdrawn, the National Army has not yet stationed a large number of troops in the city at the request of the people, for fear that they will make a comeback. Zhang Yulin, the rebel leader in Chenxi, calls himself the commander of the First Army of the National Defense Force. It has been reported that he has established four divisions. This time, the troops robbed 40,000 rifles, 400 heavy machine guns, 200 light machine guns, 400 mortars, and tons of ammunition from the arsenal. Therefore, their momentum is huge, and there is talk of attacking the Anjiang Yarn Factory. Chen Jieshi went to Chenxi to recruit and appease them, but there has been no progress. Fortunately, the burning and looting in Chenxi is not as serious as in Yuanling, because Commander Ma Shuming is from Chenxi and is the younger brother of Ma Gongran, a prominent figure in western Hunan. Zhang and others still respect the opinions of the Ma brothers.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th dispatch] The future status of the strategic base in Greenland in establishing a strong Atlantic defense network to resist armed aggression was clearly outlined on the 12th in the talks between the United States and Denmark on this Atlantic Treaty. The base issue in the ice area has been discussed by Danish Foreign Minister Rasmusson and senior officials of the State Department. According to the 1941 treaty between the United States and Denmark, the United States may still maintain several defense bases in Greenland. The eight countries that have completed the treaty negotiations are eager for Denmark and its strategic Atlantic colonies to join their defense organization. Denmark's participation in this treaty is now truly certain, but diplomatic circles believe that Italy will join this historic peacetime alliance before Denmark.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th dispatch] Danish Foreign Minister Rasmusson will leave Washington on Tuesday and plans to meet with Acheson again before leaving.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Reykjavik, Iceland, 13th dispatch] The Icelandic government announced today that it had been invited to participate in negotiations on the North Atlantic Treaty.

<p>[United Press International, Rome, 12th] Gasperi's convocation of a Monday meeting did not materialize. Parliamentarians overturned his order to convene a special Christian Democratic Party meeting and adjourned the session until 4:00 PM on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 12th] Thousands of Italian youths gathered in a square near the House of Representatives today, during the House debate on the Atlantic Pact, to stage a demonstration against the Atlantic Pact. A large number of police officers, wearing steel helmets and carrying Thompson submachine guns and batons, rushed to the scene in jeeps upon receiving the alert, attempting to disperse the crowd. Chaos ensued, and fighting broke out, resulting in numerous arrests. The demonstrating youths loudly denounced the police as fascists, and nearby shops quickly closed to avoid being affected. Earlier, senators and representatives of the right-wing Italian Democratic Socialist Party, under the leadership of Saragat, decided to support the government's resolution to join the Atlantic Pact. The leader of the left-wing Socialist Party, Nenni, strongly criticized the Atlantic Pact at the beginning of the House debate, claiming that it was an attempt to encircle the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. He also accused Prime Minister Gasperi of wanting to drag Italy into war, and argued that the Atlantic Pact included countries unrelated to the Atlantic, could not be regarded as a regional pact under the United Nations system, and was in fact contrary to the UN Charter.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 12th] Several factories in Milan and Sesto San Giovanni went on strike today to protest Italy's participation in the Atlantic Pact.

<h3 id="e43">US Actively Researching How to Cope with Germ Warfare <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Secretary of Defense Forrestal recently revealed that although the United States is not yet aware of the existence of germ weapons in other countries, for the sake of thorough preparation, various defense agencies have been preparing methods to deal with possible germ warfare tactics, and active research programs are currently underway. However, the rumor that a single small germ bomb could destroy an entire city is, at this stage, an exaggeration. The first line of defense against germ warfare is to maintain a high level of public health and take measures to protect animals and crops. Germ attacks do not cause immediate destruction of life, so they can be dealt with through appropriate medical measures. The important defense methods against germ warfare are to diagnose the types of diseases and quickly prevent their spread. Of course, these defense measures should be completed before an attack. Furthermore, we should not only deal with germ warfare attacks during wartime, but also prevent germ-related sabotage activities during peacetime.</p>

Experts revealed that if this type of spacecraft is successful, it could become the key to controlling the world militarily. This aircraft could penetrate the thick curtain of Earth's gravity and hover thousands of miles above the ground, like a space platform, for launching atomic rockets.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] According to reliable British sources: The Consultative Committee of the five signatory countries of the Brussels Treaty is scheduled to meet in London tomorrow to discuss the draft Atlantic Pact and will complete a true "Military Marshall Plan." The finance ministers and defense ministers of the five countries will also attend the meeting to discuss the economic and financial terms of this new plan, especially the issue of funding for the manufacture of military equipment.</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources: The Atlantic Pact will stipulate direct military assistance from the United States, i.e., shipping military equipment, etc., and mutual assistance among the signatory countries. This assistance will be based on the amount each country receives or provides under the Marshall Plan, and will be determined by its balance of payments and the extent of its contribution to enhancing common security. The first matter to be resolved is how the military assistance provided by the United States and Canada will be distributed to the European signatory countries. It is now believed that the amount will depend on the economic situation of each country. As the US military aid will be limited, the European countries will still be asked to make special efforts themselves, without endangering the progress of their economic recovery. It is said that the economic burden of equipping the armies of those European signatory countries whose economic recovery has not made sufficient progress, but which must still maintain large armies to fulfill their common defense responsibilities, will be partially borne by the United Kingdom.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Comintern Decides on Action Plan to Deliberately Overthrow the Tito Regime and Support Macedonian Independence <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Diplomatic sources here point out that the conflict over the Macedonian issue within the Soviet sphere of influence seems to have intensified this week. Although this conflict is only of a local nature, it may have far-reaching consequences. The recent announcement by the Communist "Free Greece" radio station that a Macedonian independent state, united by various Macedonian ethnic groups, will soon be established within the Balkan National Federation has aroused Yugoslavia's resentment.</p>
<p>It is believed here that Moscow has approved a long-term propaganda and political war plan with the goal of establishing an independent Macedonian state. This move would cause Yugoslavia to lose the Macedonian region within its southern borders, and would also deprive northern Greece of a large area of land. Moscow's support for this action is due to the belief that the Greek guerrillas are unlikely to achieve much, and that overthrowing the Tito regime is not possible in the short term.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 12th] Greek Public Security Minister Rendis said that the Greek Communists had revealed to him a conspiracy to unite Bulgarian, Albanian, and Greek guerrillas to overthrow Tito. They believed that the Soviet Union had sacrificed Greek communism for its Macedonian policy, and that the Greek communist leaders had abandoned their beliefs. The war they are currently engaged in is merely fulfilling the goals of imperialists. The action plan is said to involve launching military operations by Greek guerrillas infiltrating southern Serbia and Slavic guerrillas in Greek Macedonia, inciting the Macedonians to rebel against Tito. They believe that the Tito regime will inevitably collapse under this situation, and then Bulgarian-led rebels can march south and seize Salonica, the Aegean Sea port they dream of.</p>

Also present were Zhao Huijue and Zhang Rentao, the Director and Deputy Director of the Public Utilities Bureau. The meeting was chaired by Jiang Haoran to discuss the new price adjustment method and the determination of its base value for public utilities after the cancellation of pricing in coordination with gold yuan. After four hours of thorough discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) The base price for various public utility charges announced by the Municipal Government on March 1 this year shall be the base value. (2) Users whose meters are read from the 8th to the 23rd of each month will be charged based on the base value multiplied by the cost of living index published on the 15th of each month. Users whose meters are read from the 24th of each month to the 7th of the following month will be charged based on the base value multiplied by the cost of living index published at the end of each month. (3) For users whose meters are read from the 8th to the 15th and from the 24th to the end of the month, when the cost of living index has not yet been published, the Municipal Government may determine the increase or decrease rate based on the price fluctuations at that time, convert it into Gold Yuan, and collect the fees in advance. This increase or decrease rate shall not exceed the fluctuation multiple expressed by the period-to-period index of the previous period. If there is a difference between the published index and this increase or decrease rate, refunds will be made for overpayments and additional payments will be collected for underpayments. (4) To reduce procedures, for bills already issued by various public utility companies in early March, those that have already listed the Gold Yuan amount shall be charged according to the Gold Yuan amount listed on the bill. Those that list the units and the conversion rate shall be charged according to the units multiplied by the conversion rate. Those that only list the units shall be charged by multiplying all units by the conversion rate of 1062.5 published on the 9th of this month, and no additional charges shall be added. (5) The public transportation sector shall be handled in accordance with the foregoing methods, but after the promulgation of these measures, adjustments shall not exceed twice per month.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The American Texaco Oil Company recently donated 556 bags of rice and 561 bags of flour to the United China Relief Association for emergency distribution to displaced students in various places. There are 7,000 of these displaced students in Wuxi, 600 in Suzhou, and 900 in Jiaxing. In addition, 12 children's welfare agencies will also receive aid and will distribute it to 1,600 children. Seventy-five bags will be handed over to the National Catholic Welfare Committee to help various charitable organizations it supports. According to Dr. Xiang Lie, the person in charge of the American Church Relief Committee for China, the displaced students in Wuxi are those who withdrew from Lu and Yu, and they have not received government subsidies since the government moved to Guangzhou. They are worried about food and fuel. The displaced students in Su and Jia are also in the same predicament. The government has provided clothing and a small amount of food to students in Jiaxing, but there is not enough to go around.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Registration for Gold Businesses to Resume; 40 Applicants; Scope of Business Awaiting Further Regulations <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The city's Gold Business Association began handling the resumption registration of member companies yesterday. The initial procedure is to obtain and fill out a resumption registration application form from the association. Although yesterday was a regular holiday, the association still worked as usual because the Ministry of Finance instructed that resumption be realized quickly within a short period of time. It is reported that about 40 member companies took out application forms from the association yesterday, but none have yet submitted completed application forms.</p>
<p>It was also reported yesterday that the association will adopt a brokerage system after the resumption of business, and will expand the scope of brokers to include brokerage firms, trust departments, and jewelry stores. According to a spokesman for the association, the Ministry of Finance's order to resume business for the association is limited to members of the association, and the members of the association are originally limited to companies engaged in the sale of refined gold, and do not involve the sale of fine silver or silver dollars. In the future, after the industry resumes business, whether its business scope needs to be expanded, or whether those engaged in the sale of refined gold will also expand to other industries, still depends on further regulations by the financial authorities in the entire plan for the open gold and silver market.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Daring Landing in Jinan; Loss of Freedom for More Than a Month; Eight Chinese and Foreign Passengers Released and Arrive in Qingdao; Detailed Account of the Hijacking of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Plane <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Reported from Qingdao on the 13th by this newspaper] The list of passengers released from the hijacked CNAC plane from Jinan to Qingdao is as follows: Chen Jingwen (Director of the Naval Shipyard), Zhou Jiajun (Assistant Manager of Qing Central Bank), Zhou Zhang Fubi (Zhou's newlywed wife), Liu Zuolu, Mou Huanhai, Song Shu (all Qingdao merchants), Josef.Kanflord (German priest), W.Haealoop (German merchant), a total of eight people. According to the eight passengers who returned to Qingdao, the remaining six adults and one child were confirmed to be special passengers sent by the Communists. The list is as follows: Li Yun, Chen Tiesheng, Liu Shurong, Hua Xinghang, Xing Guozheng, Liu Jiying, and Liu Didi (about two years old), possibly aliases. According to the passengers who returned to Qingdao, the eight of them and the three crew members were taken to the Jinan Municipal Government on the day the plane was hijacked to Jinan (30th). After inquiring about their names and resumes, they were sent to the Shitaigan Hotel (Municipal Government Guesthouse), where they were divided into six rooms, occupying one floor, and lost their freedom. They spent their days playing bridge, playing Go, or throwing iron balls in the yard to pass the time. The Communists sent people to the Shitaigan Hotel to inquire again on the 31st, and reiterated that they could be safely sent back to Qingdao. On the 9th, Chen Jingwen and Zhou Jiajun and his wife were taken to the Communist Party's Garrison Headquarters for questioning. They firmly believed that they were prisoners of war. Chen and others explained the true meaning of (prisoners of war). The Communist interrogator (whose name is unknown) said, "You were forced to Jinan with guns, so what are you if not prisoners of war"? However, Chen and others' repeated explanations seemed to be effective. They returned to the Shitaigan Hotel after being detained in the Communist Rehabilitation Brigade for five days.</p>
<p>Special Passengers Apparently Related to the Communists</p>
<p>Another noteworthy thing is that when the plane made a forced landing at Jinan Airport, the Communist personnel seemed to be very familiar with the special passengers, addressing them affectionately as "Lao Yu, Lao Yu" (Lao Yu is a transliteration). And said, "You're back," as if to congratulate them. The next day, the special passengers visited them at the Shitaigan Hotel and expressed their apologies for being forced to do so. All of this proves that the hijacking of Flight 135 was a planned action by special passengers sent by the Communists, and "Lao Yu" seemed to be the leader. According to the passengers who returned to Qingdao, the seats on the plane were open at the time. The seating arrangement from the cockpit to the plane door was: special passenger, special passenger (woman holding a child), Chen Jingwen, German priest, German merchant. On the opposite row from the cockpit were: special passenger, special passenger, Mrs. Zhou, Zhou Jiajun, three Qingdao merchants, followed by two special passengers. According to a Qingdao merchant, two hand grenades were found under his seat. When this group of special passengers boarded the plane, they carried a package that was placed next to the rear seat of the plane. Twenty minutes after takeoff, the special passenger next to Mrs. Zhou, who was described as thin and tall, took off his Chinese robe and revealed a green woolen air force uniform and a handgun. The other special passengers also launched their attack, producing handguns. There were a total of three guns: one Browning and two revolvers. The female special passenger was the most calm and took on the responsibility of surveillance, and it is believed that she also had a handgun hidden behind her clothes. "Lao Yu" pointed a gun at the passengers and said that everyone was running around outside and was not allowed to move, or they would be shot dead.</p>
<p>Forced the Co-pilot to Fly to Jinan Airport</p>
<p>At that time, the cockpit door was open to distribute refreshments. Co-pilot Shu Zhilun and the radio operator were threatened by the special passengers with guns and ordered not to move and to raise their hands. They said not to joke, and the special passengers replied that who was joking with you. One of the special passengers opened the package that had been placed at the tail of the plane, took out a flight suit and changed into it, and quickly entered the cockpit, seizing the pilot's seat, and then headed for Jinan. There were no special events in the time that followed, but "Lao Yu" was the busiest coming and going. When the plane arrived over Jinan, it was shot at by machine guns. However, after circling for more than twenty minutes and discovering the intention to land, the ground personnel waved white towels to indicate the wind direction. The special passengers ordered the co-pilot to fly the plane to land. Shu replied that he was not confident and would have to ask the captain. But they did not agree and insisted on Shu getting in to fly the plane. The first attempt was unsuccessful, and although the second attempt was successful, the shaking was quite severe, but fortunately it was safe.</p>
<p>Flight 135 May Still be in Jinan</p>
<p>The passengers who returned to Qingdao also said: They saw many damaged aircraft parts at the Jinan airport, all covered with firewood. Flight 135 may still be there, and it is not easy to detect from aerial reconnaissance. The special intelligence obtained in Qingdao may not be reliable. The Communist personnel told them: We did not fire fiercely at the CNAC plane that flew low that day because we believed that the plane had come to inquire about your news. The pilots and passengers, in addition to reading newspapers that were consistent with the content of the Communist broadcast, knew almost nothing about the outside world. However, during the Lunar New Year, they constantly heard the sound of Yangko teams and drums coming and going on the streets. During that time, they happened to meet an air force member who made propaganda to them, claiming that it was not propaganda, but was immediately forbidden by the guards. They had repeatedly jointly sent a letter to the Communist Jinan Municipal Government, asking them to fulfill their promise to send them back to Qingdao. At 10:00 on the 5th, the guards announced that they would be leaving and sent a squad of soldiers to accompany them to Lancun, and then handed them over to the Communist guerrillas for extradition. The Communists said that Chen Jingwen and Zhou Jiajun and his wife were treated the same as other passengers after asking their superiors for instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Travelers Few Amidst War and Chaos: The Railroad Business Deplorable, Looking Back—The Railway Bureau Inspection Team Returns, Discussing Conditions Along the Line <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The inspection team from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has just returned from inspecting major stations along the Beijing-Shanghai Line. Yesterday, our reporter obtained information and conducted an individual interview to inquire about the recent conditions along the line and the state of this vital artery after undergoing "evacuation" and the "military transport" double affliction.</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Inspection Team included Qian Hegao, Director of the Railway Bureau's Police Affairs Department; Huang Dexi, Deputy Director; Liu Shizhong, Deputy Director of the Transportation Department; and Commissioner Peng Fenggang. They first arrived in Suzhou. The city of Suzhou has not lost its paradisiacal essence. Merchants and civilians who fled from Nanjing and across the river to seek refuge, as well as the families of provincial government officials who moved from Zhenjiang during the most chaotic period, have created an abnormal prosperity in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Severe Housing Shortage in Suzhou</p>
<p>Recently, the number of stationed troops has been increasing daily. Almost all temples, ancestral halls, and relatively spacious courtyards have been filled with soldiers and their families, leading to an increasingly severe housing shortage. The number of soldiers among the tourists at Tiger Hill and Lion Grove has also increased significantly. Public security in the suburbs has become quite problematic. Accidents have occurred consecutively. No one goes to play at Mudu, Lingyan Mountain, or Tianping Mountain anymore. Even the inspection team's desire to taste the famous dishes of the Shi Family Restaurant in their spare time was not fulfilled.</p>
<p>The next day, they arrived in Wuxi. Among the current Beijing-Shanghai line, Wuxi can be considered second to none. The market is good, public security is good, and industry and commerce are prosperous. It is rare to see troops in the city. Yuantouzhu, Five Mile Lake, Plum Garden, 　Garden, and Huishan Mountain are still captivating. Rice noodles, bean curd sheets, meat gluten noodles, and shrimp and dried scallop tofu pudding are still as delicious and delightful as ever. They are looking forward to the arrival of Shanghai's spring outing ladies.</p>
<p>Changzhou is full of soldiers everywhere. The two major ancient temples, Qingliang Temple and Tianning Temple, are no longer Buddhist sites with morning bells and evening drums. Commerce has also shrunk significantly. Because trade with northern Jiangsu has ceased after the Yangtze River was blockaded, goods are stagnant, and the city appears desolate. Zhenjiang, as the seat of the provincial government, appears orderly and disciplined. Although there was chaos at one point due to the relocation of the provincial government, it has long since recovered. The only regret is that scenic spots such as Jiaoshan, Xiangshan, and Ganlu Temple are all within the Yangtze River defense blockade zone, and tourists cannot enter. Although Jinshan is still open, there are few tourists. Last year, Jinshan Temple suffered a devastating attack, leaving only a field of rubble for people to mourn. The garrison is strong, about one army, the river defense is solid, and public security is secure.</p>
<p>Nanjing Only a Shell Remaining</p>
<p>After this major evacuation, Nanjing has only a shell remaining. The various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan are still operating in Guangzhou. The remaining furniture in the ministries has been sold off piecemeal. The Legislative Yuan has resumed sessions in recent days, and the legislators, because most of their families have left Beijing, have brought a lot of business to the Central Hotel. The Confucius Temple is about 40-50% full. The International Hotel at the new Xiaguan Railway Station has closed. The dining room at the station was once suspended but has now reopened, and business is not bad, with most of the patrons being soldiers. National Revolutionary Army soldiers who broke through during the Xuzhou-Huaihai Campaign continue to cross the river and return every day. The situation in various places is still relatively stable. The people are not as sensitive and fearful of war as they used to be. The only thing that is the same everywhere is that the sound of clinking silver dollars can be heard everywhere.</p>
<p>Two Different Scenes in the Memory of North Station Staff</p>
<p>The railway's own business is, to put it sadly, in previous years at this time, every train would have been crowded with spring outing travelers, but now it is deserted with no news at all. The employees of both railways are worried about the sluggish business. The main income of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway depends on passenger transport, with freight transport accounting for only one-third. Last spring was their golden age, with an average of 220,000 passengers per day on both railways. In recent days, they have done a statistic, and the total number of passengers on the entire railway is only about 50,000 per day. An employee at the North Station said to the reporter: "At this time last year, we were so busy day and night that we couldn't catch our breath. Relatives, friends, groups, individuals, all entrusted us to buy tickets, and people were shoulder to shoulder. The North Station was also crowded with beautiful ladies. Look at it now. It's still as crowded as ever, but the spring outing ladies have been replaced by soldiers and refugees." In his memory, two completely different scenes appeared, with an attitude of "it's unbearable to look back and talk about the past."</p>
<h3 id="e63">Second Phase Relief Lottery Tickets Sales Almost Exhausted <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Third Phase Tickets Being Prepared</p>
<p>The second phase of relief lottery tickets issued by the Central Trust of China entrusted by the Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Relief Committee has been selling very well since sales began on February 26, due to the increased prize amount and shortened lottery period. According to surveys, 70-80% have been sold. Recently, because the lottery period is approaching, sales in various distribution stores and banks are even stronger and are about to be exhausted. According to the person in charge of the relief committee, the third phase of tickets is also being prepared and is expected to be sold around the time the second phase of lottery tickets is drawn.</p>
<h3 id="e64">National School Self-Funded Students Demand Full Public Funding <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Decided to Send Representatives to Petition in Beijing</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Recently, due to soaring prices and the inability to pay for meals, self-funded students in various national colleges and universities in the city have been demanding full public funding. The United Association of Self-Funded and Partially Self-Funded Students of National Colleges and Universities in Shanghai has been organized by Tongji, Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, Music Conservatory, Shanghai Business School, and Tangshan Institute of Technology. According to statistics, there are about 2,800 self-funded students in national colleges and universities in the city. After discussion, the association has decided to send representatives to petition President Li in Beijing within a few days, requesting that the quota of public-funded places in various schools in North China be allocated to self-funded students in various schools in this city.</p>
<p>According to the association, the current cost of meals for self-funded students in various schools in the city, taking Jiaotong University as an example, totaled more than 900 yuan in February, but this month it has reached 7,460 yuan. Some self-funded students have had their support cut off due to the impact of the war in their hometowns, some have parents who are civil servants with low incomes, making it difficult to maintain the family's livelihood, and some have hometowns with low prices, and after selling grain and remitting it to Shanghai, they have suffered huge devaluation losses, so their lives are extremely difficult. In the past, they relied on working as home tutors, shining shoes, selling newspapers, selling old clothes, and holding "living auctions," trying their best to support themselves, but now, due to the crazy rise in prices, they believe that they have reached the end of their rope and can no longer endure it. In order to survive, they firmly demand full public funding and the issuance of public funding based on the consumer price index.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Faculty Association of National Jiaotong University held a general meeting at the school yesterday morning. Regarding the issue of compensation, it was resolved to insist that the original salary not be discounted and be calculated according to the local cost of living index. It was also suggested that the Association of National College and University Professors in the city send representatives to join the representatives of self-funded students who are fighting for public funding to petition in Beijing, demanding improved compensation. Some also suggested a general strike for a few days to draw the government's attention.</p>
<p>The Association of National College and University Professors in the city is scheduled to hold a regular meeting this afternoon to express its attitude on the matter of demanding improved compensation.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhou Zhengxiang, a native of Ningbo, 36 years old, a Western chef, resides at No. 77 Cunshan Lane, Wujiaochang, Caoxi Road. At about 10:15 p.m. the night before last, while passing the Paramount Ballroom on Yuyuan Road, he caught sight of a young woman, fashionably dressed, also walking west along Yuyuan Road. Zhou followed behind her, and after walking a few steps, the woman took out a lighter from her bag to light a cigarette. Zhou saw an opportunity and used the excuse of borrowing a light to strike up a conversation with the woman, walking and talking, appearing quite intimate. When they reached the west end of Yuguang Village and turned back, a thief suddenly appeared, pulled out a pistol to threaten them, and robbed a Simm wristwatch and 1,200 gold yuan before fleeing with the loot. The woman, who was standing by, had said to Zhou, "Be sensible and let it go," which aroused Zhou's suspicion. He ran to the No. 17 police kiosk near Yuguang Village, and policeman Liu Zhenguo came out with a gun and chased down the woman, bringing her and Zhou to the Jing'an Temple Police Branch. After being questioned by Section Chief Yu himself, the woman confessed that her name was Huang Suping, 31 years old, from Anhui, residing at No. 6 Zhenkang Lane, Xinzha Road, and that her husband's name was Liu Zhenya. Upon hearing this, Section Chief Yu suddenly recalled that Liu had graduated from the police academy and was assigned as a policeman to the criminal investigation team of the Jing'an Temple Branch. He was later transferred to the Changshu Branch, but was dismissed for improper conduct. He had also committed fraud in the Jing'an Temple jurisdiction and had been detained and sentenced to four months in prison by the court. Section Chief Yu immediately ordered the police to rush to Liu's home on Xinzha Road and arrest him. Zhou identified him without error, and Liu confessed after being interrogated. According to the confession, he had only been released from prison for a week and had conspired with his wife to commit robbery due to financial difficulties. Later, the robbed Simm watch and cash were found on his person. He claimed that the pistol had been discarded on the roof of the vegetable market on Heping Road when he was being chased. Police were sent to the scene and indeed found a fake pistol, which was submitted as evidence for further investigation.</p>

In addition, a portion of the original stolen goods has been recovered. The search for the remaining accomplices is still underway.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Jiang Hongming, a native of Anhui, 36 years old, residing at No. 56, Lane 3, Kaiming Lane, Luxiangyuan Road, Nanshi, opened the Hongtai Coal and Charcoal Shop at No. 4 Maigen Road last spring, and business was good. Jiang had a cousin, Zhu Changfu, who is currently unemployed. He often asked Jiang for help, several times a month. The last time, Jiang refused to lend him money, and Zhu expressed his dissatisfaction. Jiang had a fellow villager, Wang Benli, who was also unemployed. A few days ago, he went to Jiang's place to ask for help with gambling and receiving commissions. Jiang agreed, and that night he gathered friends to gamble and gave Wang a few gold yuan. Wang, after receiving the money, was still not satisfied. The day before yesterday, at dusk, he went to Jiang's residence to ask for a loan again. Jiang kept him for dinner before he left. Unexpectedly, at around 7 a.m. yesterday morning, Jiang was still soundly asleep with his wife Cao Xiuying when Zhu Changfu colluded with Wang Benli and arrived. They woke Jiang up, and Zhu immediately took out a gun and aimed it at Jiang's chest, firing two shots. Jiang was caught off guard and was hit by two shots in the chest and left waist. Jiang's wife shouted for help. The two perpetrators, seeing that their goal had been achieved, ran downstairs. Wang fired two more shots as he fled down the stairs, fortunately without hitting anyone. Afterwards, neighbors heard the screams and rushed over, reporting the incident to the Luxiangyuan Road Police Station of the City God Temple Branch, which then informed the branch. Branch Chief Qi ordered Section Chief Zhou to lead police officers to investigate. Two bullet casings were found in the room. The injured person was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. After surgery, he was unconscious and had not yet been out of danger as of midnight yesterday. The two fugitive perpetrators are currently being pursued.</p>

<h3 id="e74">McKinley Delivers a Fierce Performance Shanghai Police Suffer an Unprecedented Defeat Green Team Easily Defeats John <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Police basketball team suffered its first unprecedented defeat last night, losing 52-28 to McKinley. McKinley led 18-15 at halftime. In the initial battle, the Shanghai Police were still able to keep up. After twenty minutes, they barely lost by three points. In the second half, McKinley shone brightly, scoring eleven consecutive points, and the Shanghai Police defense collapsed completely. McKinley had lost every game in the first cycle, but improved each time, finally avenging the humiliation of the Shanghai Police in the first cycle. McKinley was tall. Last night, the proficiency of their coordination, the speed of their movements, and the accuracy of their shooting were praised by more than a thousand spectators. The Shanghai Police were helpless. They used the same tactics to counter, quick, fast, rush, and high ball back and forth, so they fell into their trap and couldn't get out. With McKinley's ferocity last night, other teams will have some difficulty dealing with them. Guard Liss is tall and shoots accurately; forward Laimshan is a one-two punch, omnipresent. In the second half, the Shanghai Police changed their lineup, but there was no cure, and the score became more and more out of sync. This game, rather than saying that the Shanghai Police were in a slump, it is better to say that McKinley was particularly brilliant.</p>
<p>In the women's game last night, the Green Team defeated John again, 62-15. The Green Team led 30-2 at halftime. In the second B group, Huili B defeated Post and Telecommunications, 52-38. The score at halftime was 29-11.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Police's lineup against McKinley last night was Shi Jiuquan, He Zeng, Wang Rongsheng, Fu Qixia, and Wang Bowen. After contact, they returned in vain for three minutes before McKinley's Owen Yi broke the dull atmosphere. He Zeng retaliated with a goal. McKinley's shots missed more than ten times, and the audience kept saying "Ah ya!" Wang Bowen scored a goal, and McKinley also improved. Owen Gaiqiaokesen, etc., scored four consecutive goals, leading 10-6. The Shanghai Police were quite surprised. After Jiuquan and Rongsheng worked hard, they were still no match for the harvest of their captain Liss alone. After 12-9, He Jingui replaced Bowen, and Rongsheng scored again and again, exceeding 13-12. The battle reached a tense stage. Soon it was tied 15-15. At halftime, McKinley still had a three-point advantage at 18-15.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Gofreyliss, etc., did not lose their prestige, 23-17. Liang Yongbiao replaced He Zeng. In an instant, it was 29-17. The Shanghai Police lost eleven consecutive points. McKinley's child Laimshan's superb skills were admirable. 31-17, He Zeng and Qixia entered, and Rongsheng and Jiuquan exited. The enemy's momentum still could not be suppressed. 37-24 Rongsheng replaced Jiuquan, and Bowen and Yongbiao also threw in one by one, 39-28. Rongsheng committed five fouls, and Jiuquan took his place. After that, the remaining game passed, 57-42, McKinley cheered loudly.</p>

<p>The Green Team's game against John in the women's group was the first game of the night. John had the momentum of a slow start and a surprise ending. Wu Hanyun scored a goal at the beginning. In the first quarter, the Green Team had thirteen and John had two. In the second quarter, one side made progress, while the other remained the same. At halftime, the score was 30-2. In the third quarter, John's Lin Jingyi worked hard and scored 8-47. In the last quarter, Huang Mingyuan of the Green Team reversed and took over as a defender. John's strong player Li Miao arrived in the last two and a half minutes. The result was 62-15, and the Green Team had plenty of room to spare.</p>

<p>Huili B Beats Post and Telecommunications</p>
<p>In the second game, the Post and Telecommunications team in Group B faced the Huili B team. The Post and Telecommunications team was the overlord of Wuxi. Because they had to travel a long distance back and forth, they played two nights in a row, which inevitably reduced their performance. There were many good players in the Huili team, and they were quite confident in exploring the basket. At halftime, the score was 29-11, and the Post and Telecommunications team was at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Post and Telecommunications team put up a strong fight, but the losses in the first half were ultimately irreparable. As a result, Huili won 52-38.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Copenhagen] It is said that after the Danish team leader returned to his country, he deemed the cost of inviting Malaya to perform in Denmark as too high, fearing it would be unaffordable for a poor team like Denmark. They are now considering inviting Sweden to share the responsibility, as the Malayan team also intends to tour Sweden. If the Malayan team does come, they are expected to arrive in Copenhagen around the 10th, for an international match against Denmark. Afterwards, they will participate in the Danish Open International Singles and Doubles tournament from the 14th to the 18th. According to him, Denmark's crushing defeat this time was due to poor conditions and a sudden loss of form by the Danish players. However, he admitted that the Danish team's skills are indeed inferior to those of Malaya. Even without the possibility of winning, if the Danish players can perform to their usual standard, they can achieve a result of six to three or four to five, he said.</p>
<p>A Collection of Telegrams of Congratulations from Singapore</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Singapore, 1st] People in Singapore were extremely excited upon hearing the news of Malaya's victory in England. Telegrams of congratulations were sent one after another. The telegram from the Singapore Badminton Association Council stated: "Congratulations on your victory." The telegram from Chen Zhicheng, former Vice President of the Singapore Badminton Association, stated: "Congratulations on your victory. We are very proud of your victory."</p>
<p>Other sports organizations also sent telegrams congratulating the Malayan team on their victory. Wang Zhanghui, Chairman of the Malaysian Chinese Football Association, told reporters yesterday that the victory of the Malayan badminton team is a great encouragement to all athletes in this country. It shows that our country's athletes are as good as other world-class athletes. Now we need to wait for our football team and other teams to prove their high level.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya also sent a telegram to London yesterday, forwarding it to the Malayan badminton team, congratulating them on their glorious achievement.</p>
<p>What Mrs. Huang Bingshun Said</p>
<p>The sudden injury to the arm of Singapore's badminton champion Huang Bingshun, which prevented him from serving the Malayan team and attending the Thomas Cup finals in Bristol, caused regret among the people of Singapore, especially Mrs. Huang Bingshun. According to Mrs. Huang, Bingshun never mentioned anything else in his letters, only saying that he was in good health. His most recent letter, sent on February 12th, also said that everything was fine. My husband had an ambition to defeat Freeman of the United States. In his letter, he also said that he wanted to compete with Skov of Denmark. Now that he is unable to fight, he may not be able to attend the All England Badminton Championships. I believe he must be disappointed, and of course, we are also disappointed here.</p>
<p>The reporter pointed out that Huang Bingshun's withdrawal from the competition with Freeman when he learned of his arm injury was a wise move. Mrs. Huang replied, "Of course, but you don't know Bingshun's personality. He is a stubborn person. In a competition, no matter how injured he is, he never gives up halfway until the end. Therefore, even with an injured arm, he would have tried his best to defeat Freeman."</p>
<p>Comments from the Danish Champion</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Danish badminton champion and Thomas Cup player Skov said today that Freeman of the United States is indeed the best singles player in the world. Skov said that the American badminton champion has strength and rarely makes mistakes in serving. Skov also recognized Wong Peng Soon as a good fighter.</p>
<p>Wong Peng Soon is a hero of Malaya and is truly worthy of admiration. Freeman fought him for forty-five minutes before a winner was decided.</p>

<h3 id="e83">The Mystery of Crossing the River <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 12th] The Yangtze River, today, is not only a lifeline that the government relies on for preparing for war and seeking peace. In fact, it has become an indicator of which path the fate of China's 450 million people will take in the future. Naturally, peace and democracy are slogans that both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have always promoted. However, how to lead China on the path of peace and democracy, peacefully or through bloodshed, the Yangtze River here has its decisive role.</p>
<p>It is a fact that the CCP wants to cross the river, and it is also a fact that the government wants to defend the Yangtze River. Therefore, "To cross the river or not to cross the river?" has become the issue of most concern to everyone, from the government to the public.</p>
<p>Military Conference: Agreed on a Plan</p>
<p>This is an unconfirmed piece of news: In February, the Communist army convened a military conference in a certain area in the Central Plains. In addition to deciding that Chen Geng and Chen Yi would serve as commanders of the East and West Line Corps respectively, a preliminary plan for crossing the river was also drafted at the conference. According to this plan, Chen Yi would cross the river in the section below Anqing, focusing on Zhenjiang and Wuhu. After capturing Nanjing and Shanghai, he would go straight to Hangzhou. Chen Geng would lead the West Line Corps, cross the river from Sha (Shi) Yi (Chang), and then detour towards the Yuehan Railway. The Central Corps, with Lin Biao's troops as the main force, would point south to Changsha along the Yuehan Railway after defeating the Kuomintang army on the periphery of Wuhan, establish contact with Chen Geng on the West Line, then cut off the Zhegan Railway to spy on Jiujiang, and coordinate with Chen Yi's troops attacking Hangzhou. This is just a plan, and how much its accuracy is researched remains to be proven by future facts.</p>
<p>Assuming that we look at the Communist army's overall offensive to cross the river from the perspective of this plan, it naturally cannot be put into action until Lin Biao's troops have moved south in large numbers. The Ministry of National Defense reported that the 3rd and 5th columns of Lin's troops have arrived in the area south of Zhengzhou. Director Deng Wenyi in Shanghai also said that this information remains to be confirmed. Obviously, before the isolated island in the middle section of the Pinghan Railway—Xinxiang—is captured, the traffic on the Pinghan Railway is cleared, the large iron bridge in Jinan is repaired, and the Jinpu Railway cannot directly reach the traffic, it is still quite difficult for Lin Biao's troops to move south in large numbers in terms of transportation. What's more, in the southern section of Pinghan, between Jianghan and Dabie Mountain, General Bai Jiansheng is still commanding hundreds of thousands of troops, stationed in Wuhan. The Communist army naturally feels that the Kuomintang army in the Central China region is a thorn in their side, but before the deployment and preparation are mature, they must not act rashly.</p>
<p>Control of Military Force in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River</p>
<p>The upper reaches of the Yangtze River are mountainous and steep, and the river flows rapidly. Sichuan can still be considered a clean land, so there is no need to worry too much. In the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, below Sha Yi and above Anqing, although there is the Jianghan area that can be used as a springboard for crossing the river, hundreds of thousands of elite troops are gathered there. Before crossing the river, there must be a fierce battle. Therefore, what everyone is paying attention to today will be the section of the river below Anqing. On the north bank of this section of the river, the Kuomintang army only controls a few bridgehead positions, and most of the river surface is exposed to the Communist army.</p>
<p>Defending the river must first defend the Huai River. This is almost a consistent principle for defending the river from ancient times to the present. Despite the support of the navy, the concerns of fighting on the north bank of the river with one's back to the water can be reduced a lot. However, if the government's military authorities want to control a narrow strip of land nearly a thousand miles long on the north bank of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it will require a very considerable force. It is no less difficult for the Kuomintang army to defend Nantong, Taixian, Yangzhou, Liuhe, Chuxian, Quanjiao, Chaoxian, and Lujiang. The withdrawal from Bengbu has already led the military to painfully decide to maintain the downstream river defense as it is today, because the Kuomintang army learned too much from the battle of Xubang.</p>
<p>How Easy is it to Cross the River in Front of the Enemy?</p>
<p>North of the Yangtze River and east of the Pinghan Railway, this vast Jianghuai Plain is entirely covered with red flags. From a topographical point of view, the Communist Party is likely not to abandon this springboard for crossing the river. In Jiangbei, the rivers intersect, which is conducive to controlling and using ships. In Jiangnan, the local communists in the Sanshan area have always been very active. They can use the Jinpu Railway facing Nanjing as the central line of advance, and use the canal line facing Zhenjiang and the Huainan Railway facing Wuhu as the roads for advancing from the left and right. Using these three major transportation arteries, they can concentrate their forces at a certain time to "cross the river in front of the enemy," perhaps by sneaking across, using the support of the local communists, occupying a few bridgeheads in Jiangnan, and then slowly expanding to create the most direct threat of "taking Nanjing directly."</p>
<p>However, how easy is it to "cross the river in front of the enemy"? Faced with the Kuomintang army's more than 400,000-strong army deployed on the first line of river defense in Jiangnan, plus the cooperation of the navy and air force, the Communist army cannot but consider it deeply. The change of tactics (because it is impossible to fill the Yangtze River with human wave tactics), the planning of transportation tools, the control of ships, and the preparation of grain and fodder are all still topics that the Communist army is thinking and planning deeply day and night.</p>
<p>Communist Army's Transfers are Extremely Busy</p>
<p>Currently, the Communist army on the north bank of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is extremely busy transferring troops and generals. Chen Yi's eighteen columns were originally stationed on both sides of the southern section of Jinpu. After the transfer, the 1st, 4th, 13th, and New 8th columns remain in the southern section of Jinpu. In the vicinity of Hefei, there are the 6th, 7th (part), New 5th, New 6th columns, and the 37th Army. Part of the 7th column and the 35th Army are in the area of Huxian and Chaoxian. Between Tianchang and Xuyi in the east of Jinpu Road, there are four columns: the 2nd, 3rd, and Bohai, and Fast. Originally, there was only the Yangtze River Column in northern Jiangsu, divided into two parts stationed in Nantong and Jingjiang. Nantong has the 104th, 105th, and 106th regiments, and between Jingjiang and Huangqiao are the 101st, 102nd, and 103rd regiments. Since the beginning of this month, the 10th, 11th, and 12th columns, originally in the Lianghuai area, have moved south along the canal and arrived in Rugao, Taixian, and Yangzhou respectively. In addition, the Air Force discovered a Communist army of about 20,000 people on the Tongyu line. A week ago, the direction of this unit's actions was Dongtai. According to recent information, the 9th Column has been transferred to northern Jiangsu, located between Yang and Tai, and the 9th and 10th Columns have begun to move east from the 10th. The 11th Column, originally in Rugao, has been transferred to the area south of Rugao. According to the military's intelligence and judgment, the Communist army's eastward movement and target may be the Nantong Qidong area, with the intention of threatening Chongming Island. In addition, it is possible that Xu Shiyou's headquarters of the Communist Army's 10th Corps has been transferred to Huaiyin. This is because the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and Liangguang columns are under Xu's command. Now, the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th columns have all been confirmed to be in northern Jiangsu, and the Liangguang column has also been confirmed to have arrived in Huaiyin. Therefore, Xu Shiyou's arrival in northern Jiangsu is naturally a very likely fact.</p>
<p>Deploying Troops on the Riverbank to Increase Pressure</p>
<p>The Communist army's footsteps are approaching the riverbank step by step. Facing the Communist army's artillery on the north bank of the river and the low pressure on the political stage in Nanjing, the people of Jiangnan are in a panic. Who is not worried about the "crossing the river" issue? The Communist army's intentions in transferring troops in northern Jiangsu, from a general point of view, are nothing more than two points: (1) To transfer and replenish new locations in order to be fast. (2) To deploy troops on the riverbank and threaten Nanjing and Shanghai, so as to further exert pressure on the government in the peace talks to demand whatever they want. From a military point of view, the Communist army will not rashly cross the river, especially since the CCP is still half-heartedly engaging in "peace talks." Before the peace talks break down, the CCP does not seem to launch a large-scale military operation to put the hat of "sabotaging peace talks" on its own head.</p>
<p>The Phenomenon of Disconnection is Worrying</p>
<p>If we do not deny that the Communist army has the intention of "crossing the river," then we do not need to be overly nervous about the current frequent troop transfers by the Communist army, as well as the fact that they are collecting grain and grass and building ships everywhere... The Communist army must prepare if it wants to cross the river. However, preparing is one thing, and whether the preparation has reached the required level is another. Today, no matter from a purely military standpoint or from a political standpoint, the Communist army's "crossing the river" not only needs to wait for a while, but also, unless there is a special change, the Communist army will not take the matter of crossing the river too easily. However, while listening to the military generals chanting "preparing for war and seeking peace," the local public opinion institutions have already raised the banner of stopping the collection of grain and corvée. Jiangnan is still disconnected, watching the seriousness of the economic crisis, the low political atmosphere, and the local communists in Jiangnan growing stronger day by day. This is indeed a worrying situation.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Rural Women Come to Shanghai to Make a Living: Two Young Daughters are Separated from Their Mother at Danyang Station: No News for More Than Twenty Days, Family is in Great Pain <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Our newspaper reader, Mr. Wang Longyun, rushed to the Social Services Department yesterday in distress, with a look of panic, as if overwhelmed by his sorrow. According to him, "Originally from Dongtai, northern Jiangsu, I am serving in Shanghai. Because my hometown is chaotic, my wife brought our five-year-old and two-year-old daughters to Shanghai on the 20th of last month to make a living. She first crossed the river to Zhenjiang and took a third-class train to Shanghai. When she arrived at Danyang Station, my wife got off the train alone to use the restroom. The people from the countryside had just arrived in Jiangnan and were riding a train for the first time. They were not familiar with the sanitary facilities on the train, so there was no need to get off the train. When she returned, the train had already left, and the two young children were unfortunately separated from their mother and went missing. Their mother was immediately panicked and cried uncontrollably. She took the next train to Shanghai to find her husband and told him about the loss of the children. The two hugged and cried with great sorrow. They had searched everywhere at the police stations of the two railway bureaus and Danyang Station, but to no avail. More than twenty days have passed, and there is still no news. I am requesting to publish a notice in the newspaper to reunite the family..." According to Mr. Wang and his wife, they only had two daughters, and they have been missing for a long time. The separation of family members is truly heartbreaking! Who doesn't have children? Comparing heart to heart, how can one not feel sad! Mr. Wang's wife is just a rural woman with no knowledge of riding a train, which caused the accident. If she had immediately asked Danyang Station to telegraph the Shanghai Bureau, they could have been reunited. This newspaper is complying with Mr. Wang's request to announce to the police officers and enthusiastic readers at each station from Shanghai to Danyang to investigate and find them. Those who have taken them in should send them back as soon as possible, which is a great deed. Also, Mr. Wang is currently working in a factory, and his monthly income is only a basic salary of eight yuan, so his hardship can be imagined. The missing children should be sent to the Social Services Department of this newspaper or No. 230, Huaian Road, telephone 31303, and there will be a generous reward. The clothing of the two children is as follows: "The older one is five years old, with long hair, wearing a small blue cotton-padded jacket, a red cotton robe, a plaid cloth leggings, black plaid cotton pants, cotton shoes, and a northern Jiangsu accent. The younger daughter is only two years old, wearing a small light blue silk crepe cotton-padded jacket, a blue crepe cotton robe, an outer woolen padded jacket, woolen cotton shoes, and cannot speak."</p>
