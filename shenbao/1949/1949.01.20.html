<h3>共黨如控制中國　爲美國最大失敗</h3>
<p>周以德指摘對華政策</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕衆院外委會共和黨議員周以德，十九日向記者發表談話稱：共產黨如果控制中國，此事將爲美國獨立一百七十年以來之最大失敗。此種失敗遠較珍珠港事件嚴重，珍珠港尙能修繕，中國方面之失敗則無法彌補。縱當共軍席捲整個中國之時，國務院未必改變其對華政策，但若目前改變政策，積極援華，挽救中國政府之軍隊，尙不失之太晚。前國務鄕馬歇爾之對華政策，並非給予援助，而係迫其組織聯合政府，此舉無異將中國拱手讓與蘇聯。國會去年批准援外法案時，曾通過本人提出之一億二千五百萬軍事援華修正案，但實際上僅數百萬元軍事配備於去年運到中國，去年十一月抄放椗之貨船三艘，只有兩艘抵華，凡此應由國務院單獨負責。</p>
<h3>外部昨正式送致照會　請各國使節遷穗　政府亦將派員往設機構</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕葉公超改任外部政次後，其常次遺缺，業經決定以原任美洲司長董霖繼任，至美洲司長一職，或將由董氏暫兼，談司帮辦陳世材前曾以顧問名義參我國出席聯大三次會代表團工作，現甫返國抵穗，因外部業務重心決定南移，正奉令待命中。</p>

<h3>中國民主自由學會宣言　闡釋和平與革命　歸納國共意見提出八項基本條款</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕中國民主自由社會主義學會全國委員會羅夢册。白堅石。范謙衷等頃發表宣言，題爲「我們看法統。革命與和平」就當前和平談判結之法統與革命二語，均有詳細之關釋，並指出一中國今日之大問題，不是如何地保持政府法統之延續，亦不是如何地將流血的革命進行到底，而乃是如何使和平與革命之能够相生相依，於和平中變革，並於變革中和平，因爲今日中國國家所迫切需要的是變革，中國人民所迫切需要的是和平。」因此國共雙方，應在「和平與革命」基礎上協商和平，並建立和平。該宣言並修正國共兩黨之意見，歸納爲協商和平建立和平之基本條款八條：（一）國民黨應放棄法統觀念，共產黨亦取消懲辦戳犯罪犯的要求。（二）蔣總統完成了領導北伐與抗戰的歷史使命，有權利光榮退休，不必再將國事煩他。（三）依據民主原則整編兩黨軍隊，國家另設超黨派的軍事機構，負責統率之。（四）沒收官僚資本。（五）改革土地制度。（六）廢除或修訂各種有損國家權益的條約（包括中美商約與中蘇友好條約在內）。（七）召開國會會議，成立聯合政府。（八）新政府應是一個前進而溫和的革命政府，以不流血的手段走中間偏左的路綫，逐步促成中國之政治民主，經濟平等與農工業生產之現代化，與分配之社會化。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>放下條件，立地成和！</h3>
<p>中華民國是人民的，故當前的和戰問題，應該讓人民先講話。</p>
<p>今天人民內心所眞要講的話，便是：「放下條件，立地成和！」</p>
<p>今天政府與中共兩方面，究竟誰能尊重民意，誰還心目中有人民，就只要看誰能先表示願意接受人民的這一句話，正式宜告不談條件，立地停戰。</p>
<p>反過來說，今天那一方面不肯直捷爽快的不談條件，立卽停戰的，那一方面就沒有和平的誠意。</p>
<p>這是一個極簡單的看決，然而是極正確的。爲什麼呢？且待下面說明理由。</p>
<p>和談到了今天，表面上似乎開了鬥，實際上顯已遇到了礁不是暗礁，而是明礁。這個礁，就是雙方在停戰以前先談條件。其實，不停戰，就不能談和，和就沒有成功之望。祗有「停戰」，才眞是和談的惟一先決條件。蔣總統元旦文吿裏的五原則，與毛澤東先生廣播詞裏的八條件，都該是停戰以後和談商酌的內容，而不是停戰以前的和平條件。雙方果要談和，就當拋棄「我」見，全爲人民着想，而絕不夾雜絲毫意氣之爭。雙方如先爭論條件，就難免有了意氣，和就無從談起了。</p>
<p>細繹蔣總統元旦文吿與毛先生的時局聲明，我們希望他們對於時局的根本意見是一致的；他們都說要爲國家謀福利，要爲人民除痛苦，他們都願奪重人民的意旨，實現民主的和平。他們的意見旣是一致，和談問應無題，而所以橫生枝節者，還不是爲了所謂一條件」在作梗？故我們人民的第一要求，先請雙方當局眞誠的一問他們的「良知」，應不應該先行立地停戰，以减少人民的痛苦。</p>
<p>中國人民經了八年的抗戰，加以三年的內亂，不要說在戰事區城，已遭了死傷盈野廬會成壇的慘禍，就是在尙未捲入戰事漩渦的城鎮鄕村，也已受了生計日蹙與顛沛流離的痛苦，如此繼續下去，一方面戡亂永無休止，一方面解放仍難實現，而人民瞻前顧後所希望唯一解救的和平，仍然渺不可得，那麼雙方所謂奪重民意，豈不是毫無着落。</p>
<p>四萬五千萬人民之中，國民黨員究有若干？共產黨員究有若干？我們雖沒有精確的統計，揣想起來，至多不過全人口百分之一二。卽使兩黨各有其百分之一的黨員，而又全部主張繼續打仗，以全人口百分之二的人的主張，而迫使百分之九十八的人民犧牲於戰爭，飢寒，疾病，和貧乏，此豈是以不忍人之心，行不忍人之政者所當爲？中共號稱「解放」人民，此又豈爲解放人民者所應爾？</p>
<p>在毛先生的意思，以爲軍事勝利業已在望，革命必須澈底，所以竟有「對於任何敢于反抗的反動派，必須堅決澈底乾凈全部地殲滅之」的豪語，其實他所要革命的祗是推翻「國民黨的政治」，但其所採的手段，却使全國人民受戰爭的荼毒。蔣總統前已明白表示，「個人進退出處，絕不縈懷」，那毛先生更何必再提不可思議的條件？即使毛先生今天的武力足以支配中國的一切，若是共未來的政治，還是不能饜人民之望，而竟至與人民的意旨相反，豈不是仍要蹈國民黨的復轍？國民政府剿共二十五年，而共黨的勢力不因武力的壓迫而渙散，相反地却愈益擴展，倘毛先生此時果眞能以天下爲公之心，開誠布公地謀求政治上的解決，把國是交由人民來公決，那不但是國家之福，也共黨之幸。否則國民黨的政治可以推翻，「反動派」可以「全部殲滅」，四萬五千萬人民却不能「全部殲滅」。今天共產黨可以推翻國民黨，如果民心不附，衆怨沸騰，雖一味以武力革命爲手段，使人民無從反抗，人類爲着生存的權利，安知後起的「反動」人民不能推翻共產黨於將來？在此二十世紀的五十年代，應已是「人民的世紀」了，武力已非國內革命的利器，２武稱兵決不能受人民的擁護．衡以毛先生所受的經騐，平昔的主張，他對於當前時局的解決，爲戰爲和，應該知所扶擇！</p>
<p>我們以爲雙方果眞要談和，就要奪重民意。民意祗要和平，尤其先要停戰：不停戰，和就無從談起。故不願先停戰，却先來提條件者，就無異阻滯了和平之到來，原則也罷，基礎也罷，一切條件，都該留在停戰以後平心靜氣開誠布公的商討，一切的一切，都該尊重人民最後的決斷。一面談和，一面作戰，豈但不是眞正的和平與民主的和平，簡直是沒有和平的誠意。</p>
<p>「放下屠刀，立地成佛！」對於當前的時局，雙方當局應該「放下條件，立地成和！」</p>
<p>寫到這裏，恰接南京專電，行政院政務會議昨日決議：（一）雙方無條件停戰，（二）派員與共黨直接談判，（三）發表以上兩項決議，作爲對中共的答覆。好了！政府確已有「放下條件，立地成和」的決心了，我們且再拭目以待中共奪重民意的答覆！</p>
<h3>避免共黨取美援　得中途改運他地　霍夫曼授予賴樸翰特權</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕經濟合作總署援華組主任克里夫蘭十九日稱：該署中國分署曾受權得在海上改變救濟物資裝運之目的地。渠吿本社記者稱：改變目的地命令之頒發，蓋爲不使共黨攖取此項物資。渠稱：總署署長霍夫曼曾給予中國分署署長賴樸翰特別權力，得以緊急措施處理復興援助。渠繼稱：霍氏曾於二個月前吿賴氏稱：「如共黨繼續滲入」，賴氏可命令裝赴華北之救濟物資改變目的地，而「此項命令之頒發，當在援華計劃更需要伸縮性之時」。</p>
<p>克氏拒不揣測第二年之援華計劃將多於或少於至四月一日爲止之第一年度之二億七千五百萬美元，渠亦拒不評述共黨控制中國後是否意卽美援終止之謂。「關於此點余不得而知，蓋此係政策問題，且尙未決定」。渠强調在中國目前危機中救濟計劃頗具流動性。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十八日電〕根據國務院與經合總署本日宣佈之數字，第八十屆國會爲進行年內之援華計劃而撥出之四億美元，其中幾近三億二千萬美元業已用去，撥予經合總署作爲對華經濟援助之用者，共計二億七千五百萬美元，其中已用去近二億元，另有一億二千五百萬美元則由中國政府指定採購軍用供應品者，其中已用去一億二干萬元以上。</p>
<p>經合總署頃復決定對華新核准額一萬七千美元，以供技術服務之用，因此截至目前，經合總署業已宣佈之對華核准額，總數已達一九九，六六九，〇〇〇美元。</p>
<p>此外，國務院並透露在另外之一億二千五百萬美元援助計劃項下，截至上星期五，業已用去一二〇，二六三，八二〇·二八美元，此較上星期所公佈之總額，增加一九，一八七·一一美元。</p>

<h3>銀根漸見穩定</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根走勢，漸見轉穩，華南匯款，前午湧到數鉅，加以國庫支撥浩繁，連日緊態，遂吿微緩，市間頭寸供源旺盛，但因貨物看好，競進有人，需要甚爲信俐，市拆在六十元至八十元，但間亦仍有昻至九十元者，瀕午聞貨幣頭寸，仍有歛象，陰霾續佈。</p>
<h3>外匯證再降</h3>
<p>央行僑匯結算牌價，昨仍未動，爲每美元合金圓二〇〇元，外匯移轉證，晨開平穩，行局做進一六九元，出一七〇元五角，銀行帮，出口商，因本街去化呆滯，加之華南廣州自當局公佈移轉證限制轉讓，市呈有行無市之局，利賣空氣濃厚，收市以進一六九元，出一七〇元，成交不多，較前回降一元。</p>
<h3>協助抽緊銀根</h3>

<h3>食米下降</h3>
<p>米市轉見下降，因無錫價格報小，人心虛軟，况連日其他物價下降，米價仍站高峯，不無居高思危，貨主均抱脫手之想。南市塲開市跌五六十元，後因出多化呆，再低四五士元合降一百元，白粳爲一千五百元，薄稻一千五百五十元，陰元降一百五十元，糙粳米有整數去路，價甚倘俐，烏鎭糙粳一千三百三十元，僅降三四十元。北市塲白粳跌一百元，早薄稻勁挫一百四五十元，糯米實銷已過時，猛降二百餘元，昨到貨二市塲共八千〇四十九石</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>開市尙疲，後市韓挺，結果略挺，初開一部份貨主仍吐售求現，老車以五百六十元開市，後因銀根轉鬆，業外各物轉升，人心亦堅，老車終以五百八十四元收市，軋升四元，兵船收市五百六十元，略見軋小，建成先小後平，雜牌粉先開者降十元，後開者與昨日同，大包麩皮軋低八九元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>跌勢持續，獨黃豆先挫後回，漢口乍豆初開疾落五十元，後聞油餅市價激升，人心堅昂，回挺五十元，以八百元收盤，車豆，亦起而跟升，後市交易異常活絡。苞米靑帮觀望，實銷滯呆，再挫百餘元，紅糧，芝麻客帮沉寂，市塲供過於求，猛挫一或餘，生仁綠豆平定，元麥未</p>
<p>做開。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>昨日重見上，，因銀根轉寬，業外物價先見上漲，人心一致趨堅，散戶趁低納取，貨主扳削，豆油由四千八百元開盤後，便疾升至五千五百元收市，生菜油收市四千五百元，各挺九百無，達二成光景·吉桶生油由四九五〇元，步升至五五〇〇元收市，挺高達千元，豆餅客帮納取，長字餅做四百四十元，升六十元。</p>
<h3>雜糧油業市塲定期休假八日</h3>
<p>交易至本月二日止</p>
<p>本市雜糧菜及油業兩市塲，格於舊規，市塲交易於本星期六（廿二日）截止，下星期一（廿四日）照常集合辦理交割結賬，結束未了手續。廿五日至二月一日休假，自二月二日（舊歷初五）起，則再行開市云</p>
<h3>本市出口業務最近更趨低落</h3>
<p>據出口業負責人談稱：本市出口業務，近來更趨低落，平素出口最多之猪鬃·桐油·皮毛。腸衣，茶葉等出口物資，近來出口之數量極少。猪鬃腸衣等物瑜出僅一萬美金左右，桐油在上週之輸出僅有少數美金，與過去之輸出量相比，相差懸殊。</p>
<p>此項輸出量减少之原因，除因長江各綫水運阻塞，兵運及軍糧運輸頻繁，貨船不敢前往出口物資無法運來外，，出口重心南移之現象益見顯著，亦爲重要原因之一·若時局仍如目前情形，本週之出口業務仍無法增加，可能更加减少云。</p>
<h3>絲綢止跌回升</h3>
<p>人絲：昨天橋初開七五〇〇〇元，一度升至七八〇〇〇元，午收稍回至七六〇〇〇元，今界爲八〇〇〇〇元，斯尼亞今票交易爲七八〇〇〇元，較前市升七八千元。同業日拆，因銀根轉鬆，昨已回小至五角至六角。</p>
<p>生絲：優吸另担，初開爲八三〇〇〇元，最高升至八五〇〇〇元，午收回小至八二〇〇〇元，輯里干經升爲六四〇〇〇元，洋行帮仍觀望，外銷卽趨沉寂。</p>
<p>綢縀：華强被面，初開爲四四〇〇〇元，一度升至四四七〇〇元，旋又回小至四三七〇〇元，午收回升至四四〇〇〇元，較前市升二千六百元左右，同業日拆五角至六角。</p>
<h3>茶市交易工微</h3>
<p>查各式紅綠茶，自品質優良者，存底趨涸後，過程久居岑靜，至於普通貨，雖有供應，但賣戶亦認爲奇貨，一味不忍割愛，致買方依然未能順利採納，交易均屬狹隘，而趨勢巍站有勁，行市迭堅不已。</p>
<p>茲悉：目前貨主對於握在手中之貨，大都擬待明春紅盤開售，綜觀此種情形，在農歷歲暮以前，市面難轉活潑。</p>
<h3>本客幫逢低有吸　棉紗市况堅俏　布買氣略動稍見回來</h3>
<p>昨日紗市堅俏，良以銀根見鬆，人心多見浮動，本客逢低收吸者不乏，複製業亦有添購，結果各紗扯升一成半强。　四二支藍鳳由六九〇〇〇元步品至七七〇〇〇元收市，較前挺九〇〇〇元。四〇支藍鳳漲七〇〇〇元三二支銀月高一〇五〇〇元，以六三五〇〇〇元結束·</p>
<p>二一支雙馬初以五二〇〇〇元低檔開出，中途曾鬆落至五一〇〇〇元，近午買氣蓬勃，價乃喊高至六〇〇〇〇元收市，終漲一〇〇〇〇元。廠單則昂一〇五〇〇元，套利一天期做四〇〇〇元。二〇支雙馬好起六〇〇〇元，他右金鷄與金城等，亦漲上六〇〇〇元左右，一六支光明最後在四〇〇〇〇元大關站住，其他各紗亦見進展。</p>
<p>棉布市氣穩旺，行情略有上升，因市上銀根較局鬆動，同業相繼添補，初以堅檔開出，中途客帮銷路依然呆滯，且浮多仍有脫手，又趨疲態，臨收聞棉紗高翔，人心復振，結果各布仍以開盤價收市。</p>
<p>龍頭細布塲外喊二一〇〇元光景，五福細布站於二〇〇〇元大關，軋漲一六〇元，喇叭童細布挺一五〇元，以一七七〇元結局，Ｂ龍頭細布亦好起一五〇元。四君子元嗶嘰自一八二〇元開出後，一度晋至一八六〇元，最低在一七二〇元做開，收市復接近一八三〇元之開盤價，較前升一七〇元。四君子元直貢一九二〇元，軋高二〇〇元，餘布仍站住上日之原檔，少有變動。</p>

<h3>Principles for Peace Talks Decided by the Executive Yuan: Willing for Both Sides to Immediately and Unconditionally Cease Fire, and Each Appoint Representatives to Negotiate; Kuomintang Central Political Committee Decides at Special Meeting Today to Still Convene</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] At the Executive Yuan's administrative meeting on the morning of the 19th, Premier Sun Ke brought up the peace issue for discussion for the first time, and it was successfully passed. Mr. Sun first described the public's desire for peace reflected in various regions, and reported that the Legislative Yuan had twice sent letters to Mr. Sun offering suggestions, most of which called for peace. The Supervisory Committee and the National Assembly representatives were also of the same opinion. Therefore, given the general trend of public opinion, the Executive Yuan should promptly discuss this matter. Mr. Sun's proposal emphasized the following two principles: first, to be willing for both sides to unconditionally cease fire, and second, to request both sides to send representatives to conduct peace talks. After the proposal was made, the opinions of the committee members were solicited. After four hours of careful deliberation, it was finally passed. Among the committee members, no one fundamentally opposed the proposal. The Minister of Social Affairs, Gu Zhenggang, hoped that the wording would be handled carefully. Qingnian Party cabinet member Zuo Shunsheng, after Mr. Sun repeatedly solicited opposing opinions, stated in the meeting that the responsible cabinet is collectively responsible to the outside world, and the cabinet's decision should be the responsibility of all cabinet members. However, before a decision is made, anyone who cannot agree, that is, those who are unwilling to be jointly responsible, can first raise their concerns. Otherwise, once the case is decided, the entire cabinet should be responsible. After Zuo's statement, there were no other objections, and the following resolution was made: "In order to comply with the wishes of the people of the whole country and to seek the early realization of peace, the government solemnly expresses its willingness to first unconditionally cease fire with the Chinese Communist Party, and each designate representatives to conduct peace talks." It is noted that the case is based on the people's need for peace, not on the eight conditions proposed by Mao Zedong, so the key point is the premise of "unconditional" ceasefire. The passage of the case was known to the citizens of the capital at 3 p.m., and the response from all parties was very positive, hoping that the Communist Party would agree to a ceasefire as soon as possible and appoint representatives to jointly discuss a major peace plan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Premier Sun Ke invited relevant individuals to the Lingyuan official residence at 4 p.m. on the 19th to discuss the implementation steps of the peace plan decided by the cabinet today. Those invited included Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhang Qun. The discussions lasted for several hours. There was also an important meeting at the presidential residence on the evening of the 19th. Some members of the Central Standing Committee in Nanjing, as well as Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, and others, were invited to study the decision of the Executive Yuan. The originally scheduled special meeting of the Central Political Committee on the morning of the 20th will still be held.</p>

<h3>Supervisory Committee Members Hope the Government Considers Releasing Political Prisoners</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Supervisory Committee members in Nanjing held a symposium on the morning of the 19th to continue secretly discussing concrete measures to promote peace. More than 20 Supervisory Committee members attended, including Yu Youren, Liu Zhe, Wang Xiangchen, and Guo Zhongkui, chaired by Gu Fengxiang. The committee members agreed not to leave Nanjing and to actively supervise all government measures. After extensively expressing opinions on the peace issue, they all hoped that the government would consider releasing political prisoners as a further indication of its commitment to peace. Other concrete measures to promote peace will continue to be studied by the peace group including Ju Zheng and others, and a temporary symposium will be held on the 22nd to make a final decision. If necessary, representatives will be sent to meet with the President to present their views. David Barr and others continue to remain in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>US Military Advisory Group to End Work Within the Week</h3>
<p>David Barr and others continue to remain in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] According to reliable sources today: The US Military Advisory Group in China has already returned the two buildings where its members resided to the Chinese authorities and will end its work within the week. However, the head of the group, David Barr, the head of the naval group, Olde, and a few important assistants will continue to remain in Nanjing. The air force section had already moved to Shanghai several weeks ago.</p>
<h3>If the Communist Party Controls China, It Will Be the United States' Greatest Failure</h3>
<p>Walter Judd Criticizes China Policy</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Republican Congressman Walter Judd of the House Foreign Affairs Committee told reporters on the 19th that if the Communist Party controls China, it will be the greatest failure of the United States in the 170 years since its independence. This failure is far more serious than the Pearl Harbor incident. Pearl Harbor could be repaired, but the failure in China cannot be compensated for. Even when the Communist army sweeps across the entire China, the State Department may not change its China policy, but if the policy is changed now, actively aiding China and saving the Chinese government's army, it is not too late. Former Secretary of State Marshall's China policy was not to provide assistance, but to force it to organize a coalition government, which is tantamount to handing China over to the Soviet Union. When Congress approved the foreign aid bill last year, it passed my amendment to provide $125 million in military aid to China, but in reality only a few million dollars' worth of military equipment was shipped to China last year. Of the three freighters unloaded in November last year, only two arrived in China. The State Department is solely responsible for all of this.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministry Officially Sends Note Verbale Requesting Diplomats Move to Guangzhou; Government Will Also Send Personnel to Establish an Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally notified the diplomatic envoys of various countries in China on the 19th, stating that as the front line north of the Yangtze River moves south, Nanjing is close to the war zone. For the safety of the diplomatic missions, they are requested to prepare to move to Guangzhou to reside. Our government will also send personnel to set up an office there to liaise with the embassies of various countries on official matters. The Chinese government will do its best to assist and properly arrange for transportation to Guangzhou and housing in Guangzhou. It is reported that the envoys of several major countries have already agreed to this matter. Except for a small number of personnel who will remain in Nanjing to continue handling consular affairs, most of the personnel will go to Guangzhou. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously sent people to Guangzhou to discuss the relocation of the envoys of various countries with the local authorities. The second batch of personnel will also be led by Liu Tingye, the head of the Protocol Section of the Department of Protocol, to plan everything.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] After Ye Gongchao was reassigned as the Political Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, it has been decided that his vacancy as the Administrative Vice Minister will be filled by Dong Lin, the original Director of the American Affairs Department. As for the position of Director of the American Affairs Department, it may be temporarily held concurrently by Mr. Dong. Chen Shicai, the deputy director of the American Affairs Department, previously participated in the work of our country's delegation to the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly under the title of advisor.

<h3>Declaration of the China Democratic Freedom Society: Explaining Peace and Revolution, Summarizing the Opinions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and Proposing Eight Basic Clauses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Luo Mengce, Bai Jianshi, Fan Qianzhong, and others of the National Committee of the China Democratic Freedom Socialist Society recently issued a declaration entitled "Our View of Legitimacy, Revolution, and Peace." They elaborated in detail on the two terms of legitimacy and revolution in the current peace negotiations and pointed out that "the big problem in China today is not how to maintain the continuation of the government's legitimacy, nor how to carry out the bloody revolution to the end, but how to make peace and revolution able to be mutually dependent, to transform in peace and to be peaceful in transformation, because what the Chinese nation urgently needs today is transformation, and what the Chinese people urgently need is peace." Therefore, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should negotiate peace on the basis of "peace and revolution" and establish peace. The declaration also revises the opinions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and summarizes them into eight basic clauses for negotiating peace and establishing peace: (1) The Kuomintang should abandon the concept of legitimacy, and the Communist Party should also cancel the demand for punishing war criminals. (2) President Chiang has completed the historical mission of leading the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance Against Japan and has the right to retire with honor, and there is no need to bother him with state affairs. (3) In accordance with democratic principles, reorganize the armies of the two parties, and the state should establish a non-partisan military institution to be responsible for commanding them. (4) Confiscate bureaucratic capital. (5) Reform the land system. (6) Abolish or revise various treaties that damage national interests (including the Sino-US Commercial Treaty and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship). (7) Convene a National Assembly meeting and establish a coalition government. (8) The new government should be a progressive and moderate revolutionary government, taking a middle-of-the-road line to the left by bloodless means, and gradually promoting China's political democracy, economic equality, and the modernization of agricultural and industrial production, and the socialization of distribution.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After returning to Shanghai yesterday, Zhang Junmai convened a meeting of the Central Standing Committee of the Social Democratic Party at Fan Garden in the afternoon, reporting on his efforts in Nanjing to promote peace talks and seeking the party's opinions on the current situation. Zhang stated to reporters: "The success of peace talks still requires the continued efforts of all parties. Based on my personal observations in Nanjing, the government genuinely possesses sincerity in restoring peace. What Mr. Chiang is currently considering is definitely not a matter of his personal future, but the future of the entire nation. Currently, international mediation is no longer possible. The only viable path to achieving domestic peace is direct negotiation. The government is currently considering how to conduct direct negotiations. As of my departure from Nanjing, it has not yet been decided whether to send Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi to Yan'an. The government is studying its response to the eight conditions proposed by the Chinese Communist Party, which will be released in the form of a public statement. The majority of government officials believe that all but the first of the eight conditions can be considered or accepted in principle." Zhang emphasized that in this day and age, the concept of "success for the king, defeat for the bandit" should no longer exist, and there is fundamentally no such thing as a war criminal. If there are government officials who are extremely disliked by the Chinese Communist Party, they may as well resign first to facilitate the smooth progress of peace talks. Zhang denied having made three suggestions to President Chiang, but stated that he had indeed advocated to the central government that the status of non-ruling parties be recognized, especially the early resumption of the China Democratic League's activities, and the release of political prisoners, and the realization of freedom of speech, etc., to create an environment conducive to peace talks.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Drop the Conditions, Achieve Peace on the Spot!</h3>
<p>The Republic of China belongs to the people, so the current issue of war and peace should first be addressed by the people.</p>
<p>What the people truly want to say today is: "Drop the conditions, achieve peace on the spot!"</p>
<p>Today, which side, the government or the Chinese Communist Party, can respect public opinion and still have the people in mind? It depends on who can first express their willingness to accept this sentence from the people, formally declare no more conditions, and immediately cease fire.</p>
<p>Conversely, whichever side today is unwilling to straightforwardly and readily declare no more conditions and immediate ceasefire, that side lacks the sincerity for peace.</p>
<p>This is an extremely simple judgment, but it is extremely accurate. Why? Let us explain the reasons below.</p>
<p>Peace talks have reached a point today where, on the surface, it seems like they have begun, but in reality, they have clearly encountered a reef – not a hidden reef, but a clear one. This reef is the fact that both sides are discussing conditions before a ceasefire. In fact, without a ceasefire, there can be no peace talks, and there is no hope of peace succeeding. Only a "ceasefire" is truly the only prerequisite for peace talks. President Chiang's five principles in his New Year's Day message and Mr. Mao Zedong's eight conditions in his broadcast speech should all be content for discussion and deliberation in peace talks after a ceasefire, and not peace conditions before a ceasefire. If both sides truly want to talk peace, they should abandon their "own" views and think entirely for the people, without any trace of emotional contention. If both sides argue about conditions first, it is inevitable that there will be emotional elements, and there will be no way to talk peace.</p>
<p>Carefully examining President Chiang's New Year's Day message and Mr. Mao's statement on the current situation, we hope that they have a consistent fundamental view of the current situation; they both say that they want to seek the welfare of the country and remove the suffering of the people, and they both are willing to respect the will of the people and realize democratic peace. Since their views are consistent, there should be no problem with peace talks, and the reason why complications have arisen is still because of the so-called "conditions" that are hindering progress? Therefore, our people's first request is to first sincerely ask their "consciences" to both parties, whether they should first immediately cease fire on the spot to reduce the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>The Chinese people have endured eight years of war against Japan, plus three years of internal strife. Not to mention that in the war zones, there have been tragic scenes of death and injury filling the fields, even in towns and villages that have not yet been swept into the vortex of war, people have suffered from the increasing difficulty of livelihood and displacement. If this continues, on the one hand, the suppression of the rebellion will never end, on the other hand, liberation will still be difficult to achieve, and the peace that the people look forward to before and after will still be unattainable. Then, isn't the so-called respecting public opinion by both sides without any basis?</p>
<p>Among the 450 million people, how many are members of the Kuomintang? How many are members of the Communist Party? Although we do not have precise statistics, we can imagine that it is at most one or two percent of the total population. Even if each party has one percent of the members, and all of them advocate continuing the war, using the advocacy of two percent of the total population to force 98 percent of the people to sacrifice themselves in war, hunger, disease, and poverty, is this what those who cannot bear to see people suffer and who govern with policies that do not harm people should do? The Chinese Communist Party claims to "liberate" the people, so shouldn't this be what those who liberate the people should do?</p>
<p>In Mr. Mao's opinion, he believes that military victory is already in sight and that the revolution must be thorough, so he has the bold statement of "any reactionaries who dare to resist must be resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilated." In fact, what he wants to revolutionize is only to overthrow the "Kuomintang's politics," but the means he has adopted have made the people of the whole country suffer from the ravages of war. President Chiang has already clearly stated that "personal advancement and retreat will never be a concern," so why does Mr. Mao need to raise inconceivable conditions again? Even if Mr. Mao's military force today is enough to dominate everything in China, if the future politics of the Communist Party still cannot satisfy the people's hope and even goes against the will of the people, isn't it still going to follow the same path as the Kuomintang? The National Government has been suppressing the Communists for 25 years, but the strength of the Communist Party has not been weakened by military pressure, but on the contrary has continued to expand. If Mr. Mao can now truly seek a political solution with an open mind and put the affairs of the country to a public decision by the people, then it will not only be a blessing for the country, but also a blessing for the Communist Party. Otherwise, the Kuomintang's politics can be overthrown, and the "reactionaries" can be "completely annihilated," but the 450 million people cannot be "completely annihilated." In the 1950s of the 20th century, it should already be the "century of the people." Military force is no longer an effective tool for domestic revolution, and armed force can never be supported by the people. Judging from Mr. Mao's experience and his usual views, he should know what to choose for the solution of the current situation, whether it is war or peace!</p>
<p>We believe that if both sides truly want to talk peace, they must respect public opinion. Public opinion only wants peace, especially a ceasefire first: without a ceasefire, there can be no peace talks. Therefore, those who are unwilling to cease fire first but raise conditions first are no different from hindering the arrival of peace. Principles or foundations, all conditions should be left for calm, open, and honest discussion after a ceasefire. Everything, everything should respect the people's final decision. Talking peace while fighting is not only not true peace and democratic peace, but simply shows no sincerity for peace.</p>
<p>"Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot!" For the current situation, both sides should "drop the conditions and achieve peace on the spot!"</p>
<p>As we were writing this, we received a special dispatch from Nanjing stating that the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting resolved yesterday: (1) both sides unconditionally cease fire, (2) send personnel to directly negotiate with the Communist Party, and (3) issue the above two resolutions as a response to the Communist Party. Good! The government has indeed made the determination to "drop the conditions and achieve peace on the spot." Let us wait and see for the Chinese Communist Party's response that respects public opinion!</p>
<h3>To Prevent Communists from Seizing American Aid, the Destination Can Be Changed Mid-Voyage; Hoffman Grants Special Privileges to Lapham</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Cleveland, director of the China aid group of the Economic Cooperation Administration, stated on the 19th that the ECA's China branch has been authorized to change the destination of relief supplies at sea. He told our reporter that the order to change the destination was issued to prevent the Communists from seizing the supplies. He said that ECA Administrator Hoffman had given special powers to Lapham, director of the China branch, to take emergency measures to handle reconstruction aid. He continued, "If the Communists continue to infiltrate," Hoffman had told Lapham two months ago that Lapham could order a change of destination for relief supplies bound for North China, and "the order was issued when the China aid program needed more flexibility."</p>
<p>Cleveland refused to speculate whether the second year of China aid would be more or less than the $275 million for the first year ending April 1. He also declined to comment on whether Communist control of China would mean the end of American aid. "I don't know about that, because that is a policy issue and has not been decided." He emphasized that the relief program is quite fluid in the current crisis in China.</p>
<p>[US News Service, Washington, 18th] According to figures announced today by the State Department and the ECA, nearly $320 million of the $400 million allocated by the 80th Congress for the current year's China aid program has already been spent. Of the $275 million allocated to the ECA for economic aid to China, nearly $200 million has been spent. Another $125 million was designated by the Chinese government for the purchase of military supplies, of which more than $120 million has already been spent.</p>
<p>The ECA has recently approved a new amount of $17,000 for China for technical services. Therefore, the total amount of ECA-approved aid to China to date has reached $199,669,000.</p>
<p>In addition, the State Department revealed that under the other $125 million aid program, $120,263,820.28 had been spent as of last Friday, an increase of $19,187.11 from the total amount announced last week.</p>

<h3>Fu Sinian Arrives in Taipei; States that Genuine Peace is Difficult to Obtain at Present; Confident that He Can Make NTU a Standard University</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Taipei Dispatch, 19th] The new President of National Taiwan University, Fu Sinian, arrived in Taiwan by China Airlines plane at around 11:00 AM this morning. Chairman Chen and the deans of the various colleges of NTU went to the airport to welcome him. Mr. Fu was then invited by Chairman Chen to lunch at the official residence. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, he met with reporters at the president's residence. Mr. Fu first stated his views on the overall situation, saying that while peace is desired by the whole country, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve the goal of true peace under the current circumstances, because the Communist Party's aim is purely to conquer, and to talk about peace is just preparing for surrender. Regarding the reorganization of NTU, Mr. Fu said that he will take openness and honesty, fairness, stability, and progress as the guidelines, and will cooperate with external academic research institutions on the basis of mutual assistance. In the shortest possible time, he will enrich the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences to reach the highest national standards. In terms of personnel, Zheng Tonghe has been appointed as Dean of Students, Yu Yousun as Chief Secretary, and Zhang Heying is proposed to be appointed as Dean of Academic Affairs, but Mr. Zhang has not yet agreed. In terms of funding, the provincial government will still cover the expenses, but it is estimated that there will be 400 million New Taiwan Dollars allocated for contingency and equipment. Mr. Fu expressed in a light tone that he is confident that he has the ability to govern NTU and make it a standard university. Finally, he said that Mrs. Hu Shi and his wife will come to Taiwan by sea on the Haiqian ship on the 21st, and Hu Shi himself may be invited to Taiwan for inspection.</p>

<h3>British Merchant Ships Prepare to Sail to Tianjin - Our Shipping Industry Expresses Opposition - Five Senior Crew Organizations Schedule Meeting Today to Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Since the outbreak of the war in North China, coastal routes have been shortened, and private shipping companies in our country have had to gradually shift their business focus to the south. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Hong Kong British Merchant Shipping Company is preparing to send a large number of ships to Tianjin to trade with North China. After hearing the news, our shipping industry elected representatives to visit Executive Yuan President Sun in Beijing a few days ago, requesting the government to allow domestic shipping companies to undertake the task of maintaining close commercial relations along the coast in order to protect our country's shipping rights. Mr. Sun promised to consider it. A reporter recently interviewed the United Federation of Senior Crew Organizations of Chinese Merchant Ships on this matter to inquire about their opinions. According to Mr. Jiang Keni, the Executive Director of the Federation: If the British shipping company's sending ships to Tianjin becomes a reality, it is tantamount to re-infringing upon our country's shipping rights. Our shipping industry should immediately take action and request the government to allow domestic ships to sail to important ports in North China, so as to ensure that valuable shipping rights are not stolen by any ambitious person taking advantage of the opportunity. At the same time, if representatives can be sent to North China to contact the Communist army, it will be even more appropriate. This action will greatly benefit the survival of 1.2 million tons of domestic ships and promote the realization of peace. If the government and the Communist army value national interests, they will surely approve this move. As for whether peace can be realized as soon as possible, our country's shipping industry will feel infinitely gratified. It is learned that the five senior crew organizations have scheduled a meeting today to further discuss this matter.</p>

<h3>The Policy of Deposit and Exchange Officially Comes to an End - Last Batch of Gold to be Exchanged Today</h3>

Therefore, although deposits and exchanges have been suspended, there will definitely be no gold price surge.</p>

<h3>Rice Ration Price Increase Sparks Opposition from Labor Community; General Labor Union Chairman Zhou to Petition Authorities Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the price of rationed rice was increased, the labor community in this city has risen in opposition. Various industry labor unions have submitted petitions to the Municipal General Labor Union, requesting them to negotiate with the authorities. The reasons stated are as follows: Rice shops in various districts were informed of the price increase in advance and claimed that the rice rations were already sold out or that the special rice rations had not yet been received. Regardless of whether the reason is that the rice shops are intentionally creating difficulties in an attempt to commit fraud or that the Civil Affairs Committee has not actually issued the special rice rations, the fact remains that most of the rice rations for workers and their families in this city have not been purchased. However, the rice price in this month's cost of living index is calculated based on the rationed price of 42 yuan per dou, which is a significant loss for the workers. Furthermore, the distribution of special rice rations this month is extremely delayed. Some labor unions had already adjusted the sales price the day after receiving the ration coupons, making it impossible to purchase rice even if they rushed to do so. Therefore, they request that the price of special rice rations for this month be maintained at the original price of 42 yuan per dou until the 30th of this month. The Municipal General Labor Union held a special meeting of the standing committee yesterday to discuss the matter and decided that Chairman Zhou Xuexiang would go to the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Social Affairs today to petition.</p>

<h3>Completion of Ditch Management Pumping Station; Water Supply to Western Shanghai to Increase</h3>
<p>In order to continue to alleviate the water shortage in western Shanghai, the Public Utilities Bureau implemented a plan in April of 1948 to connect to inland water plants and transfer surplus water to western Shanghai. The main projects, such as the pressure boosting station on Xietu Road and the laying of an 18-inch dedicated pipeline on Wanping Road to connect the existing water pipes on Xietu Road and Hengshan Road, have been completed. However, due to the excessive power required for the motors in the Xietu Road pumping station, the China Merchants Electric Power Company was unable to supply this large amount of electricity at once. The Public Utilities Bureau invited representatives from China Merchants, French Concession, and Shanghai Electric Power Companies to discuss the matter. It was decided that Shanghai Electric Power Company would increase the power supply to the French Concession, and then a dedicated line would be set up by China Merchants to connect directly to the pumping station. This power connection project is expected to be completed within days. Once the water supply is connected, the western Shanghai area will be supplied with a mixture of water from British merchants inland and the Public Utilities Bureau's deep well station. The increased water supply is expected to increase the population served in western Shanghai from 30% to 50%.</p>

<h3>War Criminal Ito Tadao Indicted by Military Tribunal; Loyal National Salvation Army Transport Team En Route Encounters Accident, Drifts to Taiwan and is Captured and Massacred</h3>
<p>Captain Ito Tadao, a war criminal recently extradited from Japan to China, has been indicted by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense after the completion of the investigation. The indictment lists the criminal facts, evidence, and legal provisions as follows: (1) Criminal Facts: Ito Tadao graduated from the Faculty of Law of Japan's Chuo University and served as a legal officer in the Japanese Army. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, various locations along the Beijing-Shanghai line fell one after another. Many Chinese patriots engaged in guerrilla warfare in the hope of restoring the country. In the winter of 1944, Li Shirong, the transportation director of the First Detachment of the Loyal National Salvation Army stationed in Pudong under the former Military Commission, was ordered to lead team members Jiang Xulun, Yao Hanmin, Yao Xingzhou, Chuan Haigen, and others, totaling twenty-four people, to hire a sailboat to go to Ningbo Lihu for training. En route, they encountered a storm and drifted to Daan Port in Taiwan. They were discovered by the enemy, and all team members were captured and sent to the former Japanese Taiwan Army Headquarters. Ito Tadao, a legal officer of the said department, together with Colonel Minoru Fukuda and Lieutenant Takeshi Ota, etc., did not treat the arrested Jiang Xulun, Wu Xuezhu, Zhao Hesheng, Chuan Haigen, Tang Jinsan, Lu Desheng, Chen Zhiwei, Xi Yixiang, Shen Amao, Shen Bochu, Cao Shuiquan, Gao Zhenchu, Shen Xianglin, Chuan Quanyun, Shen Shuigen, Zhao Linshan, Xue Maogen, Cai Lansheng, Chen Sanlin, Shen Zhicai, and other twenty people as prisoners of war. Instead, they arbitrarily used the name of military trials to falsely accuse them of anti-Japanese crimes and sentenced them to death. They were executed by firing squad on August 2, 1945, in the open space southwest of the Taiwan Army Accounting Department in Suidocho, Taipei. Li Shirong and Zhuang Genqing were imprisoned and only released after Japan's surrender. Subsequently, on June 17, 1946, Li Shirong reported the case to the Taiwan Garrison Headquarters, and the defendant Ito Tadao was arrested. During the investigation period, he was already sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years by the US Military Tribunal in Shanghai for another case and was being executed in Japan. After negotiations by our delegation stationed in Japan, he was extradited to China and sent to this court for investigation. (2) Evidence and Legal Provisions: During 1945, the defendant served as a lieutenant legal officer in the former Japanese Taiwan Legal Department and as a judge in the Japanese Taiwan Army Provisional Military Tribunal. He has admitted to this. Although he firmly denies the above-mentioned criminal facts, the circumstances of how Jiang Xulun and others were arrested, how they were transferred to the Japanese military tribunal for trial, and how they were sentenced to death have been recounted in detail by Li Shirong, a survivor of the same case, during the trial of war criminal Wang Ruiqi by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Taiwan Garrison Headquarters. Moreover, the court has also reviewed the case file, which contains interrogation records and judgments signed and stamped by the defendant during the Japanese military tribunal trial, providing solid evidence. The defendant's defense that "he was unaware of this case before and after the fact, and that the seal on the judgment was stolen by his superior" is nothing but empty sophistry and cannot be accepted. The Loyal National Salvation Army is a legitimate anti-Japanese force organized by our former Military Commission, and its members have military status. After being captured, they should have been treated as prisoners of war. However, the defendants summarily executed them, which is illegal. Even if the victims Jiang Xulun and others had previously served as intelligence agents, their victimization occurred when they were en route to Yuhu for training and their ship was caught in a storm and drifted to Taiwan. This is different from being caught while infiltrating enemy forces to carry out espionage missions. According to Articles 29 and 31 of the Hague Convention on Land Warfare, they cannot be treated as spies. The defendant, as a legal officer, was responsible for upholding the law. However, he disregarded the law and slaughtered Jiang Xulun and others, which clearly violates Article 4, paragraph 2, and Article 46, paragraph 1 of the Hague Convention on Land Warfare, and Articles 2 and 3 of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. He is also suspected of committing serious crimes under Article 2, paragraph 2, and Article 3, paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals. Therefore, he is prosecuted in accordance with Article 1, paragraph 1, and Article 26 of the same regulations, and Article 230, paragraph 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<h3>New Ruian Steamer Towed into Port; Dengheng Steamer to Undergo Cargo Inspection Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Xin Ruian and Dengheng steamers collided at the Wusongkou around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, causing damage to both ships. Fortunately, the crew and passengers were unharmed, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Xin Ruian steamer had a hole punctured in the stern of its right side, allowing river water to enter. The captain of the ship feared an accident and urgently ran the ship aground on a shoal. Passengers and others disembarked safely. The company chartered two iron barges from the China Transport Company to start unloading cargo, and some cargo was shipped out yesterday. In addition to purchasing cement and yellow sand in Wusong, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company transported 30 bags of cement and 3 tons of yellow sand to patch the hole. In the afternoon, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatched tugboat No. 314 to tow the steamer to the Qiujiang Wharf in Zhanghuabang, Wusong, to be moored. It will be towed to Shanghai this morning and then enter the dock for repairs. The Dengheng steamer also had a small hole below the waterline at the bow, which was located in the bow water tank, causing leakage. Therefore, it entered port around 10:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Yangjiadu No. 5 Wharf at noon. It is scheduled to remove the cargo from the forward hold today to raise the bow and conduct a detailed inspection. If there is no major problem, it will be slightly repaired and can then exit the port and sail south. Regarding the issue of liability for the collision, both captains have submitted reports, which have been forwarded by the two companies to the Maritime Administration Bureau for judgment.</p>

<h3>Military Vehicle Disregards Inspection; Military Police Severely Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 12:10 AM the night before last, a team of military police from the Ninth Regiment of Military Police was performing patrol duty in front of the Xinxin Grand Theater on Huashan Road and Nanjing West Road when a yellow military jeep sped past. Military Police Tao Leyuan stepped forward to order the vehicle to stop for inspection, but the vehicle disregarded everything and continued to speed away. Tao was knocked to the ground, suffering severe injuries to his right arm and head. He was immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. According to the Ninth Regiment, military police are responsible for inspecting military vehicles during curfew hours, and they are duty-bound to do so.

<h3>Measures for Issuing Gold Bonds to be Announced Within a Week</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The measures for issuing gold bonds, after Xu Kan consulted with key figures in the financial community in Shanghai and adopted various suggestions, may be announced within a week. Xu also extended invitations for private representatives to the Fund Management Committee while in Shanghai. It is rumored that Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilai, Li Fusun, Xu Guomao, and Qin Runqing may take on the roles. Qin Runqing is rumored to become the future chairman.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to restore creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance will also separately reorganize various public prices issued in the past. Active planning is also underway regarding the resumption of securities trading. This determination of the task for Gu Shanchang, the assistant manager of the Securities Exchange, to go to the capital is to negotiate the listing of gold bonds, as well as technical issues such as the capital and margin for securities brokerage firms to be opened in the future.</p>
<h3>Money Supply Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the money supply in this city gradually stabilized. A large amount of remittances from South China arrived the day before yesterday, coupled with abundant disbursements from the national treasury. The tightness of recent days has been slightly alleviated. The supply of funds in the market is abundant, but because goods are viewed favorably, there are people competing to buy, and the demand is very strong. Interbank lending rates are between 60 and 80 yuan, but occasionally still rise to 90 yuan. Around noon, it was rumored that currency funds still had a contracting trend, and the gloom continued.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Certificates Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank's exchange rate for overseas remittances remained unchanged at 200 yuan per US dollar in gold yuan. Foreign exchange transfer certificates opened steadily in the morning, with banks buying at 169 yuan and selling at 170.5 yuan. Because the street's ability to clear goods was sluggish, coupled with the Guangzhou authorities in South China announcing restrictions on the transfer of transfer certificates, the market presented a situation of transactions existing only in name. The sentiment for selling air was strong. The market closed with buying at 169 yuan and selling at 170 yuan, with little transaction volume, down one yuan from the previous session.</p>
<h3>Assisting in Tightening the Money Supply</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Since last week, the China Trust Bureau has been ordered to auction off goods on a large scale in order to contract currency and tighten the money supply. Yesterday, the bureau made the 281st decision to auction woolen fabrics. Today, it will continue to auction cotton cloth and general merchandise. There are a total of 80 boxes of woolen fabrics and 8,400 bolts of cotton cloth. There are also more than 100 kinds of general merchandise, such as leather goods, foreign wines, auto parts, hemp bags, white pine boards, sewing machines, cement, radios, etc., in large quantities. If they can all be sold, 100 million gold yuan can be recovered.</p>
<h3>If the Shortfall in Returned Checks is Not Paid, Exchange Will Be Suspended Immediately</h3>
<p>Regulations previously stipulated the time for check clearing: if banks and firms did not replenish the exchange shortfall and returned check shortfall, they should complete the procedures no later than 8:30 AM on the morning of the decision, otherwise the exchange would be suspended. However, after this method was implemented, many of the bank and company checks still failed to comply with the time. In order to facilitate business, the check clearing house has now specifically decided that if the shortfall in returned checks is still not replenished by 9:00 AM on the morning of the decision, the exchange will publicly announce the suspension of exchange at the exchange hall during the day's business. The above measures have been notified to the three public associations of banks, money houses, and trust companies by the clearing house and have been implemented since yesterday.</p>
<h3>Export Exchange Settlement Volume Last Week Slightly Increased Compared to the Previous Week</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Export Management Committee announced yesterday that the amount of foreign exchange applied for export goods in Shanghai last week (9th to 15th) slightly increased compared to the previous week. The total number, converted to US dollars, was $2,425,232.27. This includes US$1,599,425.77 for government self-settlement (i.e., frozen eggs, gauze, ore, sugar, etc.). There were a total of 20 kinds of exchange settlement goods, of which the exchange settlement amount for textiles was the largest, totaling US$1,058,546.97. The decision was made for cotton yarn, totaling US$520,988.80.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Decline</h3>
<p>The rice market is showing a decline because the price in Wuxi is reported to be small, and people's hearts are weak. Moreover, other commodity prices have fallen in recent days, while rice prices remain at a high peak, causing concern about being at a high position. Goods owners all want to sell. The south market opened down 50-60 yuan, and then due to more selling and sluggish sales, it fell another 40-50 yuan, for a total drop of 100 yuan. White japonica rice was 1,500 yuan, thin indica rice was 1,550 yuan, and Yin Yuan rice fell 150 yuan. There was a road to sell the whole number of rough japonica rice, and the price was very comfortable. Wuzhen rough japonica rice was 1,330 yuan, only down 30-40 yuan. In the north market, white japonica rice fell 100 yuan, and early thin indica rice fell sharply by 140-150 yuan. The sales of glutinous rice have already passed, and it fell sharply by more than 200 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 8,049 piculs arrived at the two markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market opened weak, but the later market was relatively strong. The initial opening saw some goods owners still selling to seek cash. Old cars opened at 560 yuan, but later, due to the loosening of the money supply and the rise of various commodities outside the industry, people's hearts also became firm. Old cars finally closed at 584 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan. Military ships closed at 560 yuan, slightly smaller. Jiancheng first fell and then flattened. The first batch of miscellaneous brand flour fell by 10 yuan, and the second batch opened the same as yesterday. Large bags of wheat bran fell by 8-9 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>The downward trend continued, except for soybeans, which first fell and then rebounded. Hankou Zha beans initially fell sharply by 50 yuan, but later, upon hearing that the market price of oil cakes rose sharply, people's hearts were firm and rose by 50 yuan, closing at 800 yuan. Car beans also rose and followed suit. The transaction in the later market was exceptionally active. Corn Qing Bang watched and waited, and actual sales were sluggish, falling by another 100 yuan or more. Red sorghum and sesame customers were silent, and the market supply exceeded demand, falling sharply by one or more. Raw peanuts and green beans were stable, and yuan wheat was not</p>
<p>done open.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Yesterday, the upward movement was seen again. Because the money supply turned loose and commodity prices outside the industry rose first, people's hearts were unanimously firm. Retail investors took advantage of the low prices to take delivery, and goods owners tried to raise prices. Soybean oil rose rapidly from an opening price of 4,800 yuan to close at 5,500 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 4,500 yuan, each up 900 yuan, reaching a light of 20%. Jittoku raw oil rose from 4,950 yuan to close at 5,500 yuan, rising by as much as 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake customers take delivery, Changzi cake did 440 yuan, up 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain and Oil Markets Scheduled for Eight-Day Holiday</h3>
<p>Trading Until the 22nd of This Month</p>
<p>According to old regulations, the two markets in this city for grains, vegetables, and oils will end trading this Saturday (the 22nd). Next Monday (the 24th), they will assemble as usual to handle delivery and settlement, ending unfinished procedures. There will be a holiday from the 25th to February 1st. The market will reopen on February 2nd (the fifth day of the Lunar New Year).</p>
<h3>This City's Export Business Has Recently Trended Further Downward</h3>
<p>According to those in charge of the export industry, this city's export business has recently trended further downward. Export materials such as pig bristles, tung oil, fur, casings, and tea, which usually have the most exports, have had very few exports recently. Exports of pig bristles and casings are only around US$10,000. Tung oil had only a small number of US dollars in exports last week, which is a huge difference compared to past export volumes.</p>
<p>The reasons for this decrease in export volume, in addition to the blockage of water transport on various Yangtze River lines, frequent military transport and military grain transport, and cargo ships not daring to go, preventing export materials from being transported, the phenomenon of the center of export shifting south is becoming more and more obvious, which is also one of the important reasons. If the situation remains as it is now, the export business this week will not be able to increase and may even decrease further.</p>
<h3>Silk Stops Falling and Rises</h3>
<p>Rayon: Yesterday, Qiaochu opened at 75,000 yuan, once rose to 78,000 yuan, and slightly fell back to 76,000 yuan at noon. Today's price is 80,000 yuan. Sinia's current bill transaction was 78,000 yuan, up 7-8,000 yuan from the previous session. The interbank overnight interest rate has returned to 5-6 percent due to the loosening of the money supply.</p>
<p>Raw Silk: Youshiren was separately responsible for opening at 83,000 yuan, rising to a maximum of 85,000 yuan, and slightly falling back to 82,000 yuan at noon. The Jie Li Qian Jing rose to 64,000 yuan. Foreign firms are still watching, and export sales have become sluggish.</p>
<p>Silk: Huaqiang quilt cover opened at 44,000 yuan, once rose to 44,700 yuan, then fell back to 43,700 yuan, and rose back to 44,000 yuan at noon, up about 2,600 yuan from the previous session. The interbank overnight interest rate is 5-6 percent.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions are Weak</h3>
<p>Upon investigation, after the existing stock of various red and green teas of good quality trended towards depletion, the process has been quiet for a long time. As for ordinary goods, although there is supply, sellers also consider them to be rare goods and are unwilling to part with them, so buyers have still been unable to smoothly purchase them. Transactions are narrow, and the trend is strongly stable, with market prices repeatedly firming.</p>
<p>It is known that most goods owners currently intend to wait for the red plate to open for sale next spring. Looking at this situation, it will be difficult for the market to become lively before the end of the lunar year.</p>
<h3>Local Customers Take Delivery at Low Prices, Cotton Yarn Market Firm and Cheerful, Cloth Buying Slightly Moves and Shows Recovery</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was firm and cheerful, because the money supply was loosening, and people's hearts were mostly fluctuating. There were many local customers taking delivery at low prices, and replica factories also added purchases. As a result, each yarn increased by more than 15%. 42-count Blue Phoenix stepped from 69,000 yuan to close at 77,000 yuan, up 9,000 yuan from the previous session. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose 7,000 yuan, 32-count Silver Moon was 10,500 yuan higher, ending at 635,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse initially opened at a low of 52,000 yuan, and once fell to 51,000 yuan in the middle. Near noon, buying was booming, and the price was called up to 60,000 yuan to close, finally rising 10,000 yuan. Factory orders were 10,500 yuan higher, and one-day arbitrage did 4,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse had a good start of 6,000 yuan. The other Golden Rooster and Jincheng also rose by about 6,000 yuan. 16-count Guangming finally stood at the 40,000 yuan mark, and other yarns also saw progress.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was stable and prosperous, and prices rose slightly. Because the money supply in the market was looser, the industry added replenishment one after another. Initially, it opened at a firm level, but in the middle, customer sales were still sluggish, and more sellers were still selling, and the market tended to be weak again. Upon hearing of the high rise in cotton yarn near the close, people's hearts revived. As a result, each cloth still closed at the opening price.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth was called outside the market at about 2,100 yuan. Wufu fine cloth stood at the 2,000 yuan mark, an increase of 160 yuan. Trumpet boy's fine cloth increased by 150 yuan, ending at 1,770 yuan. B Longtou fine cloth also had a good start of 150 yuan. After opening at 1,820 yuan, Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji once rose to 1,860 yuan, opened at a minimum of 1,720 yuan, and closed back close to the opening price of 1,830 yuan, up 170 yuan from the previous session. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong 1,920 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan, and the remaining cloth still stood at the original price of the previous day, with little change.</p>
