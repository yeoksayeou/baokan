<h3>南昌進入戰時狀態　鄱陽縣城撤守進賢　平靜平望劇戰守軍轉移陣地</h3>
<p>〔中央社南昌六日電〕此間已進入戰時狀態，大小店舖多已閉門，公共汽車亦告停駛，惟人心尚稱安定。贛保安部之南昌作戰指揮部與南昌警備部繼續留市，方主席伍市長仍坐鎮市區。</p>
<p>〔中央社南昌六日電〕（一）共軍昨侵佔鄱陽縣城，鄱陽湖沿岸刻尚安謐。（二）進賢平靜無事。</p>

<p>（一）匪五千餘，於今拂曉藉砲火掩護，向我平望猛犯，與守軍某部展開激戰，匪數度猛衝，均被擊退，旋匪大量增援，連續猛衝，卒因匪眾我寡，向原定陣地轉移。</p>
<p>（二）匪軍某部昨晚向嘉興以西硤西竄擾，自衛團隊當配合守軍，奮起應戰，激戰二小時，斃傷匪數百，詳情續查中。</p>
<p>（三）侵入杭州之匪主力，連日有向南蠢動模樣，并到處策動地方土共積極竄擾，昨一部竄抵蕭山，并續向諸暨方面竄擾。</p>
<p>（四）據蘇州來人談：留蘇原有各機關公務人員，業被匪方强制集中於城內公園中，嚴密管理，每日每人供應飯二碗蘿葡干三根，實施「思想」訓練。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據軍方五月六日晚九時發佈戰訊：</p>
<p>（一）今（六）午崑山以西匪向我崑山西五華里處陣地猛犯，經我守軍痛擊，重創潰退，從其遺屍身上檢獲文件，證明該匪為廿六軍七七師。</p>

<h3>空軍出動猛炸　京杭國道上斃共軍二千餘人　並遠征瀋陽北平太原</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京杭國道共軍二萬餘人，頃正由溧陽向長與吳興行進，所携重砲甚多，今日經空軍炸斃其二千人，砲六門。無錫蘇州有卡車數十輛，運軍火東行，經空軍炸中廿餘輛。空軍自五月三日以來，曾出動大批轟炸機，作潘陽·北平·太原等地長征，炸毀瀋陽北陵機場設備，摧毀北平南苑機場棚廠等建築物，炸中太原兵工廠煉鋼廠，使之起火焚燒，並將電廠鐵廠炸損，使之不能工作。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍息：（一）東北失隱後，匪即將各軍用基地積極整理，據為交通訓練之用，自三日至五日三天來，我空軍又開始實施對潘陽·北平·太原三地之戰略轟炸，目標為已資共軍利用之各該地軍事設備及工廠。大編隊重轟炸機羣飛瀋陽·北平，對北陵及南苑二機場投擲重磅炸彈，猛烈轟炸，飛機棚廠大部及指揮塔均直接中彈，破壞甚重：太原軍事重工業設備，亦繼被轟炸，投彈逾十噸，將兵工廠及煉鋼廠炸中起火，電力廠鐵工廠亦被彈受損。（二）我機於轟炸瀋陽機場時，地面高射砲火非常猛烈，並隱約見東塔機場停有小型飛機數架，歸航過山海關上空時，曾發現不明型高速戰鬬機二架，在我機嚴密戒備下即行遁去。</p>
<h3>青島外圍　國軍奏捷</h3>
<p>殲滅共軍四個營</p>

<h3>閻錫山賦詩</h3>
<p>粵穗民眾團體昨獻旗</p>
<p>〔本報廣州六日電〕粵穗民眾團體，六日上午十時向閻錫山將軍呈獻錦旗致敬。又，閻氏此次目桂返穗後，曾賦詩自遺，題為「過海珠橋感」詩曰：鋼骨水泥兮合則秉牢，勞燕分飛兮孤鳴嘐嘐，大川利涉兮賴此宏橋。</p>
<p>〔聯合社廣州六日電〕閻錫山氏日前自桂林抵此，據其今日向聯合社記者談稱：李代總統復職之條件有三：即軍費，軍火與行政大權。此種要求甚為簡單，條件倘予履行，李氏即可來粵。蔣總裁認為李氏之成敗即其本人之成敗，蔣氏已同意李氏運用台灣方面之軍事與財政資源。閻氏力言黨領袖與代總統間必須密切合作。今後軍事資源應供給真正需要之人，過去則並不如此。組織最高政治會議，由蔣總裁為主席，李代總統為副主席，並無不適宜。他國之政黨領袖常為國家元首，在中國則不然，政治會議純為黨內政治機構，與政府之行政並無關係。</p>
<h3>穗至各地電話　暫行减半收費</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州六日電〕電局息：穗港間長途電話，已自本月六日起改收銀元一元，茲電局為减輕用戶負担起見，即日起再將國內長途電話暫行减半收費，如廣州發往江門長途電話每次現收銀元一元二角，即日起减收銀元六角，廣州發往上海長途電話每次現收銀元八元一角，即日起减收銀元四元另五分，其餘各地可依此類維。又，特快電話原係照加急通話五倍收費，現亦减低改照尋常五倍收費。</p>
<h3>北大清華等三校　分別成立校務會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕北平六日廣播：北大，清華，師大三校，已分別成立校務委員會，分由湯用彤等廿三人，葉企蓀等廿一人，黎錦熙等十九人，担任上述三校之校務委員。</p>
<h3>暹大使仍在南京</h3>
<p>〔中央社曼谷五日電〕暹外長四日向內閣會議報告稱，彼已接得暹羅駐華大使館高級官員自廣州發來之報告，內稱：阿披巴大使仍在南京，由於京穗間電訊斷絕，無法與彼通消息。</p>
<h3>白崇禧昨飛長沙　力斥湘鄂桂局部和平說</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口六日電〕白長官崇禧，六日午偕豫主席張軫等飛長沙公幹，今夜或明晨即可返漢，對方對白氏此行頗為重視。又，豫省府留鄂人員日內遷衡隔辦公。</p>
<p>〔中央社長沙六日電〕白崇禧將軍今抵長。據語記者：此行係訪候程兼主席及老友唐生智將軍。白氏力斥湘·鄂·桂醞釀局部和平之說，謂此純係共匪分化毒謀，并强調北平傅部遭遇之慘狀，應為局部和平可憑的事實教訓，共匪除個別宰割外，別無所謂同部和平，吾人應特加警覺。論及湘·鄂·桂三省聯防問題，謂在中央治理之下，任何地方均應加强戡亂部署，非僅限於三省聯防。關於整個戰局，國軍已有重大新部署，形勢即將好轉。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口六日電〕武漢情勢外弛內張，一般人心鑒於戰爭氣氛日濃，已不若前此之恬靜，水陸兩路疏散旅客日見加多，同時駐軍某部六日試騐地雷及砲彈射擊。</p>
<h3>顧維鈞在美呼籲　訂立太平洋條約　中國人民盼美以道義及物質援助</h3>
<p>〔合眾社紐澤西州泰倫登城五日電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞五日呼籲成立太平洋安全條約。顧氏警告稱：若中國淪入共軍手中，全亞洲將赤化。</p>
<p>紐澤西州州長德拉斯哥爾五日設宴招待顧氏，顧氏在席上稱，「共產黨蔓延之危險有似洪水，對此項危險作有效之阻止，必須建築一完全之堤岸。如任憑重要部份顯露而不予保護，可能使整個悉告粉碎。北大西洋條約乃在實行此項基本目的，但需要更多此項一連串包括各重要地區之條約。將此項地區中任何部份諸如中國聽其自然，無異使此一必需之堤岸大部份漏空。」</p>
<p>顧氏又稱：「當馬歇爾計劃及北大西洋公約已使和平，自由，組織及阻止共產主義政策之重要部份之途徑獲得極大成就。若在亞洲遠東及其他重要地區實施相同之措置，在長時間亦能產生有利之後果。中國目前之危機「似一火場」必須撲滅之，此並非為中國計，乃為亞洲之自由及世界和平計，若不及時阻止，後果將不堪設想」。</p>
<p>「中國人民希望美國予以道義上及物質上之援助。近來美國若干部門似乎對援助中國之事猶豫不决，並有許多訾議，然此事非渠能公開者。」</p>
<p>「依渠而論，目前之急務並非在過去乃目前及未來。重要問題可以共同利益立場處理，以防止及對付嚴重局勢。」</p>
<p>「中國局勢固然嚴重，但及時挽回猶未晚也。渠相信美政治家以傳統之友誼，高崇之目的及龐大之資源，對援助中國解决局勢極為有利。自由及民主之大道正待量後决定」。</p>
<h3>港一水警船叛變　警官多人遭殺害</h3>
<p>〔聯合社香港六日電〕英國水警船一艘，其船員六日在茂斯灣發生叛變，至少殺害其船員五人，內有歐人二名。中國海關巡船聞警前往，發見該船業已擱淺，現將該船巡官奧立維及另一歐人之屍體載回。</p>
<p>〔路透社香港六日電〕英籍巡官二名，華籍警探一人，六日晨在香港東北廿五哩處米爾斯灣內，寶德島外之警局巡邏艇內熟睡時，被人開槍擊斃，兇手嗣又脅迫業已受傷之舵手，將該輪駛入中國境界，然後將該艇解除武裝，被害之三人為水巡隊巡官英人奧立維，海貝斯及華籍巡警王根（譯音），米爾斯灣在大鵬灣南，乃著名之海盜區。</p>
<p>〔聯合社香港六日電〕水上警察巡邏艇叛變案，香港警察總監已懸黨港幣五千元緝拿兇手。</p>
<h3>美擬承認中共政權說　艾契遜嚴正否認　並謂國務院中並無新蘇份子</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕國務卿艾契遜六日斥責柏林封鎖談判，涉及美國接受蘇聯對中國問題見解一項謠言為」「絕對虛偽」。當時，艾氏在參院撥款委員會陳述意見，民主黨參議員麥卡倫引述討論此項謠言之某報社論，問艾氏作何觀感，艾氏當答以此種謠言，絕對無稽。關於麥氏所述國務院親蘇份子正草擬解决對蘇問題之方案，包括承認中國共產黨新政府在內一項謠言，艾氏亦矢口否認，據稱國務院並無親蘇份子，亦無此種方案。</p>

<h3>社論　防火災於未燃！</h3>
<p>邇來上海人民正為着時局發愁，可謂憂急萬狀，惶惶無主；徹上徹下，無不緊張地在準備萬一。不料五月四日憑空又添出好多年來空前大火，事出意外，真是漏舟偏遇打頭風，禍不單行。據市長廣播及各報消息，是日下午二點零五分，法漕區西新街蘇家角起火，延燒四個鐘頭又十分，至晚六時一刻，餘燼未熄，望之若火坑，受災棚戶，三千二百餘，流離失所的災民二萬左右，焚燬面積廿餘萬平方公尺以上，比中山公園大一半。火場最長距離一英里，大小十餘工廠亦遭回祿，出勤消防車四十餘輛　參加救火員五百多人，燒燬幫浦車二輛，損壞接水皮帶甚夥，焚斃的屍體像一段焦本，慘不忍睹。</p>
<p>水能載舟，亦能覆舟；火亦如是，它能活人，亦能殺人。火災是意外災難，也是家庭災難，我國少見統計，姑借美國的作參考。美國參加第二次世界大戰為三年八個月，海陸軍死亡人數達二七〇·〇〇〇以上，受傷的六五〇·〇〇〇以上。但在戰後三年多內，因家庭意外而死亡的一一八·〇〇〇，永久性受傷的四八〇·〇〇〇，毀肢·殘廢·傷害得不能工作的一七·四五〇·〇〇〇。家庭災難中墮跌而死的佔首位，共一六·〇〇〇人，其次即屬焚斃的數目五·六〇〇。再次係窒息的二·〇〇〇，中毒的挨到第四位，一·五〇〇，槍死的一·二〇〇，尚餘五·七八〇〇則為其他原因所喪命。死亡人數中以老人幼兒為眾，六十五歲以上的犧牲者百分之五十五，五歲以下的幼兒佔百分之十八，每年家庭災難所受的損失五五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美金，此數不過指工資。醫藥費和保險費三類而言。</p>
<p>中國人口多出美國三倍。若此種損失以人口比例計算，則全中國每年因家庭災難而蒙損失將為二十二萬萬美金，節省此偌大鉅款，我們何必還向人家磕頭求美援？這次上海的火災到現在算不出數字來，恐怕永遠算不出確實的數字，這豈不是損失鉅款的一個眼前實例？家庭災難以外，復有其他的意外災難。九四三年的美國，死傷人數可以紐約排到舊金山，死的人數達九七·〇〇〇，聚之足成為一個城市。受傷的人數　紐約和芝加哥二個大市的人口，受傷的損失計四·九〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美金，喪失三八〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇天的人力。其中以汽車肇禍而死二〇·〇〇〇·傷八〇〇·〇〇〇，家庭中喪命的三二·〇〇〇，受傷的約五百萬，這一年單家庭災難損失的六〇〇，〇〇〇·〇〇〇萬金。</p>
<p>醫學在猛晋中，傳染病减少得很多，今日西洋社會死亡率昇高的不是肺病·霍亂·傷寒·白喉，而是意外傷害。一九〇〇年美國意外傷害佔全國各種死亡率百分之六十五點四，居死亡第九位，一九四七年却升到第四位佔死亡率百分七十一點二，西洋人也有句話：「文化愈進步，則不測之禍愈多。」這是對的，因為文化愈進步，發明的東西愈多，凡事有利必有弊，機器發明是文化進步的表徵，可是機器運用不慎，便會殺死人。汽車幫助我們跑路迅捷無比，可是汽車殺人頂多，人家說進街道如入虎口，這頭吃人的老虎即是汽車。在文明社會裏用文明產物，傷害人已經太多了，在智淺的社會裏運用文明的產物其傷害一定將更多。平時如是，戰是益甚。中國的輪船飛機火車年來闖禍不知有多少。</p>
<p>講到上海的火災，因為人口的密集及物資的堆積，起火的可能性最大，而且星星之火，最易燎原，災情之慘重甚於任何都市。過去太久的火災不必再說，即以最近的情形而論，誰也不會忘了今年一月間的三次大火災。第一次是一月六日閘北中興路大火，燒燬草瓦平房五六百間；第二次是一月八日南市多稼路的大火燒，燒燬棚戶二百餘間；第三次是一月十二日廣肇路的大火災，燒燬棚戶六百餘間。被燒得「家破人亡」的災民，達數千人之多。這幅慘絕人寰的畫像，現已重現於我們的眼前，怎不令人驚心怵目！但救火之道，在於防火於未燃。</p>
<p>安全教育是防患未然的方法，生命越值錢的地方，安全教育也越發達；西洋有「安全第一」的口號，安全計劃成立必須每人參加，必須强迫實施。家庭，鄰居，同事，人人守安全規則。今日上海急實施安全教育。安全中防火最緊要，上海歷次火災十九由棚戶起火，工務局和警察局，責任是卸不掉的，已有的棚戶暫且不談，正在建築的棚戶，政府為什麽裝聾作啞，例如其美路頭條橋遷來的本棚遷來不知搭了多少，有二個市立學校聯名請警局工務局，設法制止，但當局迄今相應不理，這是什麽道理？市政首長對此有何處理，這不過舉一例，類此的情形，恐還多呢！曲突徙薪，總比焦頭爛額的工作高明一點吧！</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕民主黨議員麥卡倫今日主張在美國恢復黃金自由市場，並指斥目前限制私人在美國購買及持有黃金一事為「荒謬」，請參議院司法委員會建議取消黃金交易之限制，繼續實行金本位，法由財部收買以每盎司三十五美元出售之黃金，據麥氏宣稱，財部於兩年內收買價值三十七億元以上之黃金，其中百分之九十六係來自國外。財部對此項巨額黃金擬作何用，從未說明，亦未擬具何種政策。值此緊要之時，吾人應嚴重考慮此項黃金之用途，及處置方法，黃金自由市場可使匯價較易變動，協助建立穩健之貨幣政策，並促進國內及國際之安定。</p>
<h3>美在日佔領費　每年五億元</h3>
<p>美必須解除此種負担</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦五日電〕美國外交界今日消息，美國已向遠東委員會提議，「准許日本舉借外債，與各國訂立商務經濟協定」，遠東委員會即將加以討論，惟聞英法已「堅决表示反對」。英國外交部對於此事不表示意見。據悉，美國政策在使佔領軍僅成為「一種保護力量」，儘量以職權賦予日本政府。美國佔領日本經費每年約五億元，此種負担如須解除，日本必須能借債，經商，自治自立而後可，美國向遠東委負會提出具體建議，原因即在於此。</p>

<p>英下議院辯論中國問題詳誌</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦五日電〕英下院五日辯論中國局勢，政府聲明其採取對中國不干與政策，惟保守黨要求政府有所行動，以阻止共產主義蔓延於遠東。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦五日電〕國防部長亞歷山大五日在下院辯論長江英艦遭砲轟事稱，據當事者報告，事出意外後來擴大，並非蓄意或預謀。英國亟欲避免干涉中國內戰，但對於吾人直接負責之領土則决不示弱，政府正在密切注視香港。艾德禮總理旋亦在下院稱，共軍砲轟英艦，並非有計劃之舉動，他國兵艦駛往長江上游，亦有道轟擊可能。艾氏提及政府應承認中共之一項建議時稱，「此事須視中共之行動而定，目前討論此事尚非其時。」</p>
<p>保守黨白特勒氏談香港防衛問題</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦五日電〕屢次謠傳將繼任保守黨黨魁之白特勒於今夜結束下院中對長江中共軍砲轟英艦事之辯論稱，香港之真正防衛，有賴軍隊者少，最要者厥為動員英方外交與戰略資源，使遠東各國結合一如在西方然。「余願見美國·印度·邐羅·荷蘭與法國集合一起，團結我人方量，俾我人可獲得保障，在東方有一公約，足以防止戰爭，如已在西方所見者然。</p>
<p>英大使仍留南京麥米蘭指為不當</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦五日電〕下院五日辯論長江英船事件時，國防部長亞歷山大稱，中共當局至今為止，仍拒絕英國領事人員所嘗試之一切接觸，保守黨領袖麥米蘭在今日午後下院開始辯論時，攻擊政府對中國局勢措置失常，且缺乏效率。麥氏謂：「余不明瞭英國大使何以需留駐於南京，政府早應將其召回，可留一代辦進行職務。」述及紫水晶號事件時，麥米蘭謂：「使軍艦深入境內，而與外界遠離，為一不智之舉。」彼對英國海軍士兵之勇武備致頌揚，但謂：「此意外事件，表示吾人力量及判斷能力之低落。」麥氏繼問，「共產主義是否將蠶食中國，抑中國將併吞共產主義？余相信英國貿易在中國仍有能進行有效任務之機會。」</p>
<p>陸海空各種部隊大量開香港增防</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕國防大臣亞歷山大頃告下議院稱，英國正將大量增援開往香港增防，其中包括陸海室軍部隊，抵達後可使香港之英陸軍增為兩個旅團，每旅包括三個營。此外尚有特種部隊，包括坦克·野戰砲·高射砲·平射砲部隊等，空軍增援部隊包括戰鬥機在內，現在香港之海軍艦隊，將增加巡洋艦一艘，必要時更將加派航空母艦一艘，亞歷山大表示英國雖竭力避免被率涉於中國大陸的戰爭中，但英國對於由其直接負責之土地內，决採取堅决態度，香港之保持中立及不干涉中國政治的政策，已有長久的傳統歷史，英國政府始終維持不干涉中國內戰的政策，同時則在香港採取極謹慎的注視態度，在决定保護香港的其他措施之際，英政府的動機祇在决定使中國不定的局勢，不致危害香港人民的安全，或妨碍經由香港對華合法貿易的和平進行。亞氏又述及香港之警力，謂該地警力現在較一九四一年之一千二百二十名，增加已一倍餘，同時香港志願防軍的征募，亦已在積極進行中，但結果尚未盡如理想。</p>
<p>港傳統中立政策各派人士均獲益</p>
<p>談及香港傳統的中立政策，亞氏指出中國國共兩派人士均獲享受香港採取中立政策的利益，其唯一所應遵守的條件，祇為遵守香港法律，不得從事有損中英間關係的行動而已。英當局目前所採的步驟，將用以對付任何破壞該地華人，不論國民黨或共黨人士居住條件的行為，或擾亂和平的行為。固不論此等破壞行為係如何引起，惟為公眾利益計，目前尚朱便就此等步驟，透露其詳細情形。亞氏又曰香港糧食狀况，大致尚屬滿意，米糧供應極為充足，當局並已採取步驟作儲糧準備。反對黨發言人麥克宏倫認為香港最好的防禦方法厥惟由英政府明確聲明，香港若受攻擊，將被視為侵略行為，而產生必要的後果，香港為東方的直布羅陀，必須加以保衛，英國在馬來亞及新加坡的重大利益與香港密切有關。麥氏强調建議英國在亞洲有許多友人，但彼等需要安慰，故英國必須對亞洲灌輸信任的精神，以美國人民為基礎的西方夥伴系統，必須能使其擴大至東方。</p>
<p>里斯特夏團英軍定十一日開香港</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕陸軍部息：現駐里斯特之里斯特夏兵團，將為第一批啟程赴香港增防之部隊，定於五月十一日登輪啟程，繼之啟程者將有皇家砲兵一聯隊，皇家工程隊一隊及步兵兩營。</p>
<p>英倫各報紙重視增强港防衛問題</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦六日電〕此間各報六日皆以顯著地位刋載昨日下院辯論中國問題時對增强香港防衛之消息。保守黨之「每日郵報」稱，「誠然吾人將擁有香港」。左翼之「每日鏡報」以大字標題謂，「派飛機大砲軍隊往香港」，保守黨之「每日快報」則問；「六十名軍隊足以保衛香港乎？」泰晤士報評論稱，「國防部長亞歷山大將英國之對華政策與對英國負責之領土所取之政策，作明顯之劃分。在中國本土，英國各外交領事代表至今仍留居本位，且嘗試與中共當局獲得接觸，以保護英僑及彼等之利益，香港之防禦工作及合法商業之維持，則為英國直接之責任。故已採取措置，加强其內部安全，且增派陸海空部隊前往。」保守寫之「每日電訊報」，反對某工黨議員之建議，英國應立即承認中共政權謂，「吾人絕不能立即承認此慘殺吾人海軍，且不接受吾人抗議之中共政權。」泰晤士報對承認中共問題，則謂「首相曾稱，對中共將以其行為判斷之，此實為一賢明之答覆。」</p>
<p>英政府與滬總領保持最密切接觸</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕國防大臣亞歷山大五日在下院辯論中國局勢時聲稱，英政府已就在緊急時所將採取之措施與上海英總領事保持最密切的接觸，此等措施目的在給予該地英僑以目前環境下所可能的保護，並於需要及英僑自願時，使其得以撤退，亞氏又曰，除軍事局勢外，上海的金融及經濟狀况亦為英政府所嚴重關切，雖然此等局勢的最後補救，應由中國人採取。但當地英僑已與上海英總領事在研討之中。總之英政府將繼續執行其和平政策，並在最可能的基礎之下，協助英國僑民。</p>

<h3>未來巴黎四强外長會議　美决爭取主動地位　希望德奧問題同時求解决　蘇可能建議劃世界勢力圈</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓六日電〕據若干跡象，高級外交顧問正力促國務卿艾契遜在巴黎四强會議中採取主動，否則蘇聯將利用該項會議，對德國人民發動主要的宣傳攻勢。渠等認為蘇聯楞望提出下列三項建議：（一）在德國中央政府下統一全德國；（二）加速撤退佔領軍；（三）加速完成對德最後和約。此三項建議，無疑將獲得德國國家主義者的支持。顯然國務部正在草擬應付及擊敗蘇聯此項建議的草案，目前雖尚未完成，很官員指出，西方國家可能要求蘇聯同意對奧和平解决，此舉將使蘇聯自奧·匈·羅三國撤軍，而削弱蘇聯在東南歐衛星國地區的力量。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓五日電〕國務院發言人麥克德謨五日透露：美國無任所大使傑塞普因負責解除柏林封鎖的初步談判，或將隨國務卿艾契遜赴巴黎參加五月廿三日的四强外長會議。渠稱，會議的正式議程尚未擬定，渠並稱，奧國問題可能包括在議程內，因其與德國問題關聯。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓六日電〕外交圈內六日發生一種揣測：蘇聯可能在巴黎四强外長會議中，向美國提出一項「密議」，正式將世界分為兩大勢力　圍。具有該項觀點的觀察家稱，蘇聯可能建議：（一）美國承認中國共產黨政權，在中國採取「放手」政策，承認中國為蘇聯的永久勢力範圍。（二）蘇聯則將停止其在西歐的分裂運動，並同意以民主方式解决德奧問題。美官員指出，此舉無疑將被國務卿艾契遜所拒絕，因為美國絕對反對任何形式的秘密協定。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林五日電〕英佔領軍司令羅勃森今日在記者招待會中，預測德國中央政府將於不久成立。羅勃森謂，對鎖解除後，四國會議若能順利進行，則成立一全德中央政府已不在遠。羅氏認為在波恩憲法之規定下，德人可獲得和平快樂及足以自傲之生活，希望東德地方政府能樂意按波恩憲法參加聯邦政府，此舉並無不可能之處。同時德共黨在法蘭克福發表宣言，要求立即停止設立西德國的工作，指出在彼恩草憲之德領袖，不應「破壞」巴黎四强談判成功的可能性。</p>
<h3>歐洲議會憲章要點　促進經濟社會進步為宗旨　籌委會首屆會議週二在法舉行</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕英·法·荷·盧·義·愛·瑞·挪·丹九國外長暨比大使今日在此簽訂設立歐洲議會的憲章。憲章規定歐洲議會之宗旨，為完成更大的國結，以維護共同的繼承文明，並實現經濟及社會進步。</p>
<p>歐洲議會內分兩個機構，一為各政府代表組織之委員會，一為咨詢議會。每國得在前一委會中派代表一人，通常應為該國外長或其代表。咨詢議會有議員八十七人，計英·法·義各十八人，荷·比·瑞典各六人，丹·挪·愛爾蘭各四人，盧森堡三人。咨詢鐵會得討論外長委員會提交之任何問題，經三分之二投票議員通過，即成立决議。此次籌設歐洲議會之談判結束後，曾發表如下之公報，表示希望歐洲議會之首次成立會，得於八月間在斯特拉斯堡召開，並冀該首次會議將為歐洲史上最重大之事件。</p>
<p>希土入會事認為可接受　關於希臘土耳其政府請求加入該組織事，公報表示此項聲明經各發起國認為可予接受，俟歐洲議會下之委員會成立後，即將加以討論。該委會同時亦將研究其他國參加歐洲議會之可能性。公報又曰，各外長今日在許曼主持下舉行首屆籌備委會會議，推舉法外交部巴黎君為秘書長，並决定籌委會下屆會議於五月十一日在巴黎舉行。公報並特別聲明有關防務之事件，不在歐洲議會討論範圍之內。</p>
<h3>華萊士反對大西洋公約</h3>
<p>四强外長會議期間　美參院應暫停行動</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓五日電〕美進步黨領袖華萊士於聞悉四强同意解除柏林封鎖後談稱，渠主張在召開外長會議討論德國問題前，參院外委會應暫停就正在審查中的大西洋公約採取行動。渠强調聲明，此乃最大亦是最後的一次機會，以與蘇聯和平解决糾紛。渠並指責美政府故意不宣布蘇聯已於三月廿一日向美建議解除柏林封鎖之消息，以免妨碍大西洋公約之成立。</p>
<h3>德境美區破獲　共黨非法集會</h3>
<p>抄獲大批宣傳文件</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林六日電〕德境美佔區警察今日破獲共產派社會統一黨之非法會議，捕獲廿人，並抄擭大批共黨文件。其中透露蘇聯在巴黎四外長會議可能之企圖：（一）擭得四國協議，永久摒絕德國於新歐洲聯邦與大西洋條約之外。（二）廢棄西方六國關於管制魯爾工業區之法規，並承認蘇聯在魯爾區之利益。（三）廢棄美英法未得蘇聯同意所採取之重大對德政策，包括設立西德共和國在內。（四）設立全德國政府，該政府將繼續蘇佔區所已實行之「民主措施」。</p>
<h3>四巨頭會議　無召開必要</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統之表示</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓六日電〕杜魯門總統昨在每週記者招待例會上稱，四强巨頭舉行會議以解决德國問題糾紛，目前尚無此必要。如四强外長月底在巴黎開會時得獲致德國問題之協議，則根本無舉行四頭會譏之必要。</p>
<h3>莫斯科反響</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科五日電〕莫斯科電台今日下午正式證實四强就柏林問題獲致協議的消息後，蘇聯人民均為之鬆了一口氣。莫斯科電台在短時間內，兩次廣播協定的全文，一般人民的意見乃為「此乃長時間內世界最好的消息。我們初以為西方國家不願成立協定，但現在透露了真正的希望。我們希望四强能在外長會議席上獲得關於德國更廣的協定」。一汽車司機的意見，認為此次協定為克莢將軍去職的結果。許多俄人皆認克萊為成立德國問題協議的主要障碍。</p>
<h3>南亞洲全部　已感大地震動</h3>
<p>美編輯認為不致赤化</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約六日電〕新聞週刋副編輯伊薩克斯，遊歷東方，甫經回國，在週刊中發表一特別報告，標題為「南亞洲將赤化乎」？內稱，中共軍隊未渡江前，南亞洲全部已感覺中國大地之震動。此等震動常可引起遠方之恐慌。馬尼刺報紙嘗載不明國籍之　　曾在呂宋島沿海運輸共軍及軍火登陸。馬來亞英國警察謂當地共黨叛軍，係由來自中國之特別人員領導。越南法人方面稱，共軍已越界與越盟軍隊聯合。暹羅　披汶元帥則以共黨陰謀罪拘捕華僑達數十人之多，凡此皆無庸疑神疑鬼，引起恐慌。真確的事實自有其不可抗之巨大力量。</p>
<h3>柏林封鎖區槍聲</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林六日電〕德國警察今日在蘇聯對鎖之柏林市內開槍，此種事件發生於預定解除封鎖前六日。當時柏林東區有汽車一輛，在黑暗中疾駛向美佔區，德國警察當即開發排槍，但未能阻止該車，西柏林警察亦未發現該車蹤跡。</p>

<h3>英國工黨</h3>
<p>— 勃萊斯福著　宋桂煌譯</p>
<p>在早期，時常有人提出疑問：這些新人物，其中只有少數人曾在其早年生活中，有過担負行政責任的觀念，那末，他們是否有着為政府所需要的行政能力呢？我們不可忘記，工黨中有許多分子，甚至大多數分子，都曾受　地方行政的訓練。不過在兩個以工黨為少數黨的內閣的早期中，曾有令人失望的親象。一例毫無經騐的閣員，其周圍雖都是治事專家，但是自己却忘記了他的選民所期望於他者為何事，是常見之事。工黨雖有這些缺點，但是每週開會時，他們却有一個民主工具，為各老黨所無者。首相與全體閣員雖是最後的負責人，但是在這些會議中，政策及政績報告均經交由全黨檢討，因而侮個同志都有參加批評的機會。工黨之能服膺合體民主制度，遠過於其他兩黨。其依賴於黨的領袖的氣質與權威的成分，確實較少。自從麥克唐納於一九三一年去職，情形尤其如此。當時工黨的威嚴雖一時遭受損失，但是它仍能保持統一，且自受麥氏去職的打擊後，反而更加奮發有為。</p>
<p>克拉克先生以庇爾為英國的典型保守派，而我的朋友漢蒙則以莫拉斯頓（Gladstone）為典型自由黨分子。在我看來，則哈爾提實為工黨政府中之最可敬的人物。但是他屬於先驅者的時代。他之為政，可能媲美於聖雄甘地。就忠實及正義感而論，要以漢德森為典型。他也抱着一種寬大為懷的國際觀，他出長外交後，便以决絕的熊度，遵循工黨大會所通過的一切决議，一概無遠。</p>
<p>理論的基礎</p>
<p>最後，我當述及一個最重要的問題：即工黨所提出的社會主義，其內容如何？它既無條目分明的信條，又無正統的黨綱。各種思想學派，如費邊派。基爾特社會主義派·馬克思派。在工黨中，均有其容身地位。莫理斯·加本特·及　勃生，均在以上三十年中為工黨創造了理論。托湼·柯爾·及拉斯基，則又在當今時代中為其創造了理論。它接受了我們祖先們所為我們爭取而得的公共遺產，即公民自由及言論自由的傳統。它所拋棄的，是十九世紀中的放任主義，利潤動機，及自由企業的信仰。說明它的各個目標，要比說明它的主義還容易。（未完）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕外傳證交已分發遣散費，定期遣散職工，宣告永久停市一節，茲據該所總經理顧善昌語記者，迄目前為止，該所僅係根據本月四日該所理監事聯席會决議，暫停市場集會而已，所內並未分發遣散費，亦無永久停市之意向。至經紀人之保證金，是否可予發還問題，仍須請示財經兩部後，方能核辦。</p>

<h3>公用指數凌駕一般物價　市參議會小組委會　今日開會研討對策　副議長表示相信必有解决辦法</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕近以公用事業計價指數，一再上漲，市民咸感不勝負擔，紛向本市參議會呼籲糾正，該會已定今日下午三時，召集公用小組委會開會，研討此案，並請非該小組委員會之參議員，亦撥冗列席參加。</p>
<p>又悉；本市總工會理事長周學湘，認為全市工人所得工資，僅卅七萬倍，五日公布之公用指數，已漲至九十五萬倍，使一般工人不勝負擔，影響公眾生活，而工商各業亦有倒閉之虞，昨曾具函向市參議會建議，迅予制止。六區紡織業公會理事長王啟宇，亦以公用指數凌駕一般物價之上，該業用電量最鉅，倘不迅予另謀兼籌並顧辦法，全市工廠，必迅趨崩潰，後果不堪設想，特具函向市參議會說明其意見。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自本市各界對瘋狂上漲之公用事業指數，一致聲請糾正後，記者昨特向市參議會副議長徐寄顧氏徵詢意見。徐氏亦表示該項指數確屬過高，惟市參議會公用小組會已定七日下午三時召開會議，渠屆時亦將出席，相信該會對此一問題必有一解决之辦法。故在小組會未有决議之前，渠對此事不願多作評論。</p>
<p>一讀者來函指出極不合理的幾點</p>
<p>一讀者陳志致函本報稱：此次公用事業每日照物價指數，逐日調整收費後，公司方面，固然日有盈餘，比以前所謂關元計價，好上萬倍，不必再要裝窮說苦，所苦者還是在我們用戶的身上。筆者對於此次以物價計價的辦法認為有幾點是極不合理地方，應請市政當局督促各公用事業公司有改善之必要：（一）每日依物價指數調整收費，公司方面，當然是最賺錢的方法，不過第一點不合理，譬如實行依物價指數收費的第一天，指數是十四萬倍，到前天的指數，已漲到九十五萬倍了，假使一個月以後，不知要漲到多少倍，而付費的滿一個月之後憑賬單照付費日的指數，一次付的，假定付費日的指數是二千萬倍，試問用十四萬倍時侯的水電，照二千萬倍價目付費，請問合理不合理？假使公司方面認為物價上漲太大，必須實行物價指數計價，那麽應該每日抄表，每日收費，方是正理，如果認為每天抄表收費，手續麻煩，這是公司的責任，他要獲取這非份之暴利，所以强逼用戶延遲一次付費，用戶對這種額外負擔，有權拒絕的。道種眾瘦獨肥的辦法，絕對不合理，應澈底取消，另訂妥善的收費辦法。（二）上海多的是里弄，一條弄堂，多數祇裝一只水表，水費是公派的，假使有二三十戶的弄堂里，一天之內，决計收不齊的，即使一天收齊，到明天去付，指數調整價目漲了，請間如何派收，因此糾紛迭起，怨聲載道，對於這種公共用戶，當局也應該訂一個付費的期限標準，方為合理。（三）對於各公司之賬目，是否真確，尚有懷疑之處，聽說法商水電公司用六十位外國人，他們的薪水，可以抵到三千個中國工人，這種不正常的現象，希望市政當局澈底查究，各公司的賬目，是否有虛報浮報，亦應嚴格審查。</p>

<h3>美國民主黨縱橫談（上）</h3>
<p>— Arthur　M．Schesinger著　宋桂煌譯</p>
<p>美國共和黨雖有「大老黨」（Grand　old　party）之稱，但是它實際上只達到了九十四歲的矯健中年。民主黨則已年達一百五十六歲，顯然是在美國政治中活動而迄未中斷的最老政黨，差不多與美國同年。早在華盛頓內閣中，當哲斐孫與漢彌爾敦激烈鬥爭時，民主黨的生命便已開始了。漢彌爾敦的聯邦黨，後來雖曾以輝格黨（Whig　party）與共和黨的名義一再還魂轉世，但是它僅僅活了三十年，惟有哲斐孫的黨的生命迄未中斷。這個黨雖然孱弱多病，但是它具有一種活力，以到處雖然歷經戰爭，不景氣，政治失敗，以至政治勝利，終能活到今日。</p>
<p>民主黨最近已經當政十六年之久，惟內部分裂情形甚劇，不可諱言。當一九四八年舉行全國代表大會之際，幾陷於分崩離析之境；因了舉行競選宣傳之故，便引起了黨內種種互相攻擊詆毀的激烈風潮。如紐約市長杜爾與密士失必州的翰朗金（John　Rankin），又如漢特森與布爾特，除概不贊成為杜魯門提名而外，在他們之間很難看出共通之點。美國人士中擁護民主黨的分子及有組織的工人們，尋常固然支持民主黨，但是最熱中的鑽營家及虐待勞工者也支持民主黨。</p>
<p>即在外交政策方面，大多數的民主黨雖都是國際主義者，但是誰也不能忽略了惠勒·奧丹尼爾等含有毒素的孤立主義者。佛蘭克林·Ｄ·羅斯福，雖具有政治的天才，竟也難將這班人收攏在一起。現在，民主黨殆已四分五裂了。有一部分黨員跟着華萊士及親共產派走上進步黨的故道，另有一部分黨員，則追承受着南卡羅林那州長爾蒙及那班不知悔改的叛徒。其餘的分子，為南方之中和派，新政派，工商界鉅子，及樸素無華的民主派，暫時勉強團結在一起，採取共同行動。這個非常的政治同盟，也曾有過真正的意義嗎？</p>
<p>佛琴尼亞州的麥狄遜是美國憲法之祖。他曾有一句名言道：「黨派形成之最普通而持久的泉源，向來都是財產之各種不平等的分配」。他又曾說：「根據財產的差異，應為近代立法的主要任務，因而尋常的行政必須含有黨派的精神」。</p>
<p>麥狄遜時代的階級利益如何呢？有些人士圍繞於工商界，即資產階級及債權人，商業資本家及金融資本家。這班人士意圖控制漢彌爾頓的黨，而因了漢彌爾頓聯邦黨的興起，麥狄遜序列中的其餘分子，——卽地主·負債人·及無產階級——便立於的驛地位。因而哲斐孫的黨便起而為非工商界的分子說話。自此以後，民主黨便始終堅持這種任務，迄未改變態度。</p>
<p>誠然，在十九世紀的六十年代中，民主黨所得北方人民的支持曾失去了不少，這是因為蓄奴者在黨得勢之故；並且其後便永久未能恢復北方農民的支持，其間只有偶於短期內，北方農民因榖賤之故，才不得不擁護市里安及佛蘭克林·D·羅斯福。但是自內戰以後，民主黨便逐漸恢復了它的舊有模型，即將南方保守派農民·北方的自由分子·有組織的工人·及城市中的工商領袖，雜粹式地聯合起來。</p>
<p>哲斐孫與漢彌爾頓，當華盛頓任總統時，一個任國務卿，一個任財政部長。哲斐孫說：這兩個人「好比一個窠中的兩上雄鷄」，但是兩人的互爭雄長，不徒是人事之爭而已。漢彌爾頓意欲建立一個強有力的中央政府，其賦稅政策足以引起工商界的擁護。他覺得對於資產家，必需爭取之，而他對於平民，則不予信任。他在制憲會議中曾經說道：「平民都是好亂而多變的，他們判斷與決定，鮮有是正確的」。</p>
<p>但是哲斐孫同情於南方農民，深怕中央集權政府，將允許資本家剝削農民。他主張限制聯邦政府的權力，並保障各州的權利。他並且提出，人民是權力的最後保藏所，並且是行政者之最後的裁判人。哲斐孫從這種見地來看覺得不安。一七九三年五月十三日，其時華盛頓第二任為時尙未久，哲斐孫便寫了一封責難的信給總統，於其中第一次提出了他的黨的名稱。他說：「欲保持現有的政府體制的共和黨，其人數較之君主聯邦派為尤少」。</p>
<p>今日的民主黨，在當時被稱為共和黨者計達三十年之久，其人數雖較少，但黨員均願繼續奮鬥下去。他仍以哲斐孫為一個偉大的政治領袖，因為他對於民主的價值與目標，有着深刻無比的了解。哲斐孫的原則，誠如林肯後來所說，便是「自由社會的定義與原則」。他不但具有偉大的哲理，並且具有非凡的才能，而為具有魄力的政治家。他即在寫信給華盛頓以前，亦曾親詣紐約，以促成南方農業家與北方工商界領袖的團結。例如　坦馬尼公所的領袖柏爾，後來也成了一個有勢力的哲斐孫派。哲斐孫的理論，我們在今日已經司空見慣　了。</p>
<p>一八〇〇年大選，因為哲斐孫準備充分，所以共和黨（即民主黨）便握得政權。當這位被仇恨的佛琴尼亞人就任總統的時候，聯邦黨分子只有戰慄。在新英格蘭境內，婦女們甚至將她們的　飾品都收藏起來，誠恐要被新政府將其沒收了。康納狄格洲的聯邦黨杜懷特（Theodore　Dwinght）宣稱，這個國家為惡人和愚人所統治了。他如瘋如癡地哭喊道：「一對一對的夫妻們及其一切幸福，都糟糕了，都被毀滅了；我們的妻女，都淪為妾腅了；我們的兒童都將一世便無人照顧了。……憑我們的想像，還有什麼情形比了地獄的這一面更加悲慘可怕嗎？」</p>
<p>但是哲斐孫自就任總統以後，自始卽表示和解的態度。他在就職演說辭中說道：「我們都是共和黨，我們都是聯邦黨。」他一朝握權之後他的為各州爭取權利及嚴密遵守憲法的主張，便被收回了。他表示遇必要時，便可通融憲法行事，例如購買路易西安那，便是一端。換言之，爭取各州權利，在哲斐孫實為一個次要的問題，而最要者卻是他之欲為國家實現各個基本的目標。有許多聯邦派都因哲斐孫政策的中和性而改入共和黨，例如約翰·亞當斯便是其中之一人。至一八二〇年，聯邦黨遂告滅亡。</p>
<p>傑克於一八二九年就任總統後，黨的歷史便已進攻了新的階段，傑克遜是一個強有力而具決斷性的領袖，不畏懼任何人，而對於政策則能堅信不疑，因此，他便將總統職位的整個性質改變了。他的名譽活躍於史冊。當他就職之日，羣眾擁入白宮，接受他的招待，但是他的貢獻更加真實。他的加強行政元首的權力，為後來的歷屆總統樹立了典範，至今被追踪不息。</p>
<h3>鋍——鋼的代用品</h3>
<p>— 佩君</p>
<p>早在一八二七年人們就發現鋍是一種原素。二十餘年以前，冶金學者才開始實騐。產地多在西半球，目前以美國最盛。從緬因分布到喬治亞，分布在南北達科大烏台·窩民·內華達·加利福尼亞新墨西哥和亞利桑那等地。</p>
<p>我們平常以為金屬是壓力之下，都會漸漸減少效力。在工業界中，這個問題很為嚴重。現在各種機械都要高速度下工作，那麼整個的工廠機輪也許就要停止。所以我們應該趕快在每一個重要地方，用一種在不斷增高的壓力下仍能保持原有的性質的金屬，來作彈簧和機器的複雜部份，實際上「鋍銅」就是所城要的這種東西。</p>
<p>鋍是具有金屬的性質，比鋁輕三分之一，可是卻比鋼還硬，不過在一定壓下雖硬，卻非常脆，落地就會摔破的。在許多的冶金專家研究後，終於有了神秘的發現。把百分之二的加在鋍銅裏，再加熱，可使銅化硬，像鋼的硬化一樣。後來再試騐它們合金的張力，直以它升到每一寸十八萬五千磅時才停止上升。換言之，一根半寸直徑的鋍銅能舉起二十噸重的東西。</p>
<p>鋍銅除了它的張力之外，還具有其他有用的性質，在煉油廠，軍火廠裏工人用鋍銅做的鎚子，鑿和剷子，不會像鐵的能發生火花，因而引起意外的燃燒。</p>
<p>降落傘上的鋼扣子常使飛機上的磁性羅盤有所偏斜，所以現在也用鋍銅代替。必須在濕空區或是在鹽或其他腐蝕性的化學品近傍工作的機器，也常鋍銅，因為它不生鎔也不腐蝕。</p>
<p>實際上一切新航空機械，包括最精致的駕駛器在內，都含有鋢銅——這樣使他們即在最壞的環境下也非常正確。新的高度測騐器全賴一個活動的銹板，氣壓稍有變更，它就知道，而且又耐用。近代運輸機和轟炸機上，總有一百多部分都是鋍造的，它們決不會用的時間太久而失掉效率。</p>
<p>醫院裏，實驗室裏，工廠裏，電力廠船領上綫，都是用和航空所用差不多的彈簧和隔板。汽車，無電機電車上現在也開始用鋍——凡是高速度或是要工作得非常緊張的地方沒有不用它的</p>
<p>愛克司光可以透過純粹的，所以被用為愛克司光上的窗戶。醫生們把它用為他們分析原子機器上的目標。</p>

<h3>柏林封鎖即將解除　空運工作不擬中轟</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦六日電〕四強為解除德國境內商業交通限制與在巴黎召集外長會議事，五日發有聯合公報如下：</p>
<p>英美法蘇政府現已獲致下列協議：</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯政府自一九四八年三月一日以來對於柏林與德國西部及東區與西區間之交通，運輸，貿易所加之一切限制，將於一九四九年五月十二日解除。</p>
<p>（二）英美法三國政府或其中任何一政府於一九四八年三月一日後對於柏林與西區及西德與東德間之交通運輸，貿易所加之一切限制，亦於一九四九年五月十二日解除。</p>
<p>（三）上述各限制解除後之十一日，即一九四九年五月二十三日，定於巴黎召開外長會議，討論德國問題及因柏林局勢而引起之問題，包括柏林幣制問題。</p>
<p>外相貝文六日在下院宣讀上述公報時，宣佈渠定七日前往柏林視察空運工作，同時將英政府之謝意與賀忱轉達一切有功之工作人員。述及解除封鎖一事時，貝文稱：「英國政府歡迎上述協定之成立，下院可明瞭四強對德問題商討之破裂，其責非在吾人，因吾人始終願與其他佔領國共同商計德國問題也。惟在封鎖繼續之時，無法進行討論，今則封鎖即將解除矣」。貝文旋指出英國政府所持之堅定與合理之政策，現已獲得軍事證明，以後應付外長會議之新問題時，英政府將一本過去之堅定與合理精神，是可保證者也。外相最後聲明在局勢完全明朗化之前，柏林之空運仍將不予中輟。</p>
<p>英車海外航空公司「蕭脫索倫脫」最新式水上飛機為慶祝英國商業空運三十週年紀念已於晤日晨以天鵝飛瀑入之姿態降落泰五士河，此為倫敦人士廿一年來第一次在河上看見水上飛機。倫敦市長艾爾文爵士將於下星期命名此機為「倫敦市」號，一九二八年八月曾有另一蕭脫式水上機「加爾各答」號降落伏克斯霍爾與蘭伯斯兩橋之間，但與此機相較，大小懸殊。</p>
<p>英國海外航空公司，進以星座式飛機航於倫敦至錫尼間，兩地距離一萬二千哩，飛航時間現已縮短至四日以內。</p>
<p>由於埃及夜航限制之撤消，英國海外航空公司遂能更改其飛航時間表。自倫敦至錫尼時，於開羅過夜，於喀喇基停留三小時半，按以前則於羅馬過夜，而於喀喇基停留達十七小時之久，另一過夜地則仍為新加坡。</p>
<p>自錫尼飛回倫敦時，於開羅稍停後，即飛抵羅馬過夜。</p>
<p>英國廠商多人與領袖工業家展覽會之香港貿易代表團。殖民部次官里斯·威廉氏即席發表演講，稱讚港戰後復興之成績。渠稱英政府已撥款一百萬鎊，作為香港之建設經費，其中半數發展漁業及農業，另一半則作為建設都市之用。據最近自香港歸來之某君稱，彼對於香港漁業計劃之推行工作，印象至深。及醫藥服務亦備致讚揚。渠指出，香港解放時僅有學童三千人。及至一九四六年底，學童之數目已超過淪陷前之數字。此外，香港商業數字亦打破所有紀錄。一九四八年進出口貿易數字高達二億三千萬鎊。香港實可稱為動盪世界中的一個和平與繁榮之綠洲，英人決意維持香港此種地位。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律釋疑　好事多磨「不治」之症阻撓吉期　唐鳴時律師主答</h3>
<p>蔡文彬問　小兒於去年八月憑媒與某女士訂婚，議定今春婚宴。不料某女士訂婚後即患肺病，對方要求一切醫藥費用，無要我方負担。我方不允，則對方擬將我方所有之首飾變賣，作為醫藥之需。請問萬一對方不顧一切，竟將該項飾物變賣，則應如何對付？</p>
<p>〔答案〕法律上固然有不治之症許離異之規定，（解約當更容許），但所謂不治之症，須經「禁治產」程序確定，不能僅憑醫師證明，即可認定也。照現代醫藥之發展，肺病並非一定不治，此點如涉訟，定為雙方所爭執。</p>
<p>至於訂婚之後，女方醫藥費之支出，除養媳婦外，似不能責令男方負担。此指家庭舊式而言。若新法自由，朋友且有互助之誼，未婚無婦，當較朋友更進一層也。</p>
<p>訂婚禮物，一經交付，其所有權似已移轉；即使解約而可以要求賠償，亦不必定須原物，故對方如加處分，尙不能構成起訴原因。</p>

<h3>日本宮闈秘笈　宮女座談會「真相社」主催</h3>
<p>性變態的老宮女</p>
<p>本社：記起宮女，我們很想知道一點。</p>
<p>甲：宮女分五階級，最高是簡任官司，之下是薦任，委任，雇員，下女等，我在宮內的時候，單是下女就有一百多人以上，宿舍在紅葉山下。</p>
<p>乙：是的，但禁止男子進出，可是和服店派去教繡花的裝飾的男師，還是可以進出的。</p>
<p>丙：宮女昇到簡任，就有七個下女服侍他，她們對侍下女，卻連一點一劃，都要分出階級來的。</p>
<p>丁：宮女的規律，不准宮女結婚的，他們在宮中唯一能接近的男子，祇有侍從士官是年青魁梧的，宮女們都偷偷的愛上他們，尤其是高級的中年宮女，整天愛找他們饒舌，「我給你做親愛的母親好嗎？」肉麻當有趨的愛煞了侍從士官，有時沒有錢，連自已的帽都賣去，把錢給他們用。（苦笑）</p>
<p>戊：我曉得，有的侍從官亦討厭這班中年宮女，時常會避來避去的避她們，免得囉唆。（笑聲）</p>
<p>一段短時間裏，差不多每天晚上，都是這個樣子，我們要睡了，已宮女就會打電話來，說有事指名要我去。我祇得硬着頭皮走完那條陰沉沉的走廊，幸虧不幾天，那條走廊上加派了一位荷槍實彈的「近衛」士兵，不然我真為害怕得生起病來。每當我轉彎，走進已宮女的臥室時，她總是東拚西湊的想點事情給我做，乘機同我扯談。有一次談：煤汽關不上，結果我少許用力一撥就關上了，（笑聲），我說要走了，她偏拉着你不放，一雙迷眼，真是惡形。（笑聲）</p>
<p>乙：四五十歲的老宮女，都還打扮得妖艷怪狀的，如松本，松尾，三殿那班老太婆就是。</p>
<p>丙：帶眼鏡的松本老太婆就是個老妖物，由收生婆昇到薦任宮女，在宮內是有名的「歇斯的里」。</p>
<p>丁：差不多的老宮女，都有點性變態，松尾時常要我在她房屋裏談天，祇要在門外的三殿咳一聲，松尾就氣得自管往後門出去了。三殿老饀伙一進來，就是問長問短的問我，怎麼會與松尾在一起談話的？談些甚麼？真真是討厭極了，卻又不好生氣。（笑聲）</p>
<p>乙：年青的下級宮女，亦都因為性問題無法正當地解決，因此個個精神頹喪，臉色青黃，真可憐的。（嘆惜聲）</p>
<p>裕仁研究微生物學</p>
<p>本社：日皇在離宮期中的生活怎樣？</p>
<p>乙：丙小姐跟「天皇」出獵的機會多點，請先講罷。（掌聲）</p>
<p>丙：我跟他去過葉山和那須，當地政府官員和人民都要來拜謁，過後，「天皇」才帶領武裝的侍從士官十數名到山上去找苔石，或到海灘去收集貝殻。</p>
<p>本社：「天皇」自己動手嗎？</p>
<p>乙：是侍從們動手的，他祇是指手劃脚的這個那個，指來指去。（笑）</p>
<p>本社：那時候丙小姐的工作呢？</p>
<p>丙：那時候我專管送「天皇」的飯（還有乳素和紅茶），送到山上或海灘去，相當份量白飯盤，要捧在眼睛以上，走二三里路送去，這條「皇規」我總覺得太殘酷。</p>
<p>本社：飯捧着走二三里路，灰塵不會進去嗎？</p>
<p>丙：這倒都有蓋子覆着的，最可惡的是送去的東西都得捧在眼上八分高，再加上手腕上掛一隻盛滿紅茶的茶瓶，這樣走二三里路，倦得真支持不住身子呢。（驚嘆）</p>
<p>本社：「天皇」到葉山去做什麼的？</p>
<p>丁：到葉山灣，乘汽艇遊來遊去，有時在嚴灘上拾些貝殻，據說：葉山的貝殻並沒有什麼珍奇的，但「天皇」卻歡喜葉山。（笑聲）</p>
<p>本社：據說「天皇」是很喜歡　集微生物材料的，是嗎？</p>
<p>丁：是的，到葉山去的時候，侍從總是提着那隻「御集微生物材料箱」。</p>
<p>本社：找到的微生物材料，帶回研究室研究嗎？</p>
<p>戊：在葉山特設有「御用微生特學研究所」，據說儀器等設備完善極了。一位年老的眼部博士經常在裏面負責研究「天皇的微生物學」。天皇在下午運動完畢，到晚餐前的一段時間裏，有時亦到實驗室去「研究」。　於他能夠研究到什麼程度，我是外行，總之走進實驗室的「天皇」，雖　學者自居，但侍從士官卻時常在背後講他頭大心慌。（笑聲）</p>

<h3>Air Force Launches Fierce Bombardment; Over 2,000 Communist Soldiers Killed on the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway; Expeditions to Shenyang, Beiping, and Taiyuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] More than 20,000 communist troops on the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway are currently marching from Liyang towards Changxing and Wuxing, carrying many heavy artillery pieces. Today, the air force bombed and killed 2,000 of them and destroyed six artillery pieces. Dozens of trucks in Wuxi and Suzhou, transporting military supplies eastward, were hit by the air force, with over 20 vehicles destroyed.

From the 3rd to the 5th, over the past three days, our air force has again commenced strategic bombing of Pan Yang, Beiping, and Taiyuan, targeting the military facilities and factories in those locations that have been seized for use by the communist army.

<h3>National Army Achieves Victory on the Outskirts of Qingdao</h3>
<p>Annihilates Four Battalions of Communist Troops</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th] More than 20,000 bandits attacked the outskirts of Qingdao, including the puppet 94th and 95th Divisions and three independent regiments of the South Sea Military Region.

<h3>Yan Xishan Writes Poetry</h3>
<p>Guangdong and Guangzhou Mass Organizations Present Banners Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 6th] Mass organizations in Guangdong and Guangzhou presented brocade banners to General Yan Xishan at 10:00 AM on the 6th as a mark of respect. Furthermore, after returning to Guangzhou from Guilin this time, Yan wrote a poem for his own reflection, titled "Feelings on Crossing the Haizhu Bridge," which reads: "Steel and concrete are tightly joined, but swallows and doves separate, singing mournfully. Crossing the great river relies on this magnificent bridge."</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 6th] Yan Xishan arrived here from Guilin a few days ago. According to what he told a United Press reporter today: There are three conditions for Acting President Li to resume his duties: namely, military expenses, munitions, and full administrative authority. These demands are very simple. If the conditions are fulfilled, Li can come to Guangdong. President Chiang believes that Li's success or failure is his own success or failure, and Chiang has agreed to Li using Taiwan's military and financial resources. Yan strongly stated that close cooperation is essential between the party leader and the acting president. Military resources should be supplied to those who truly need them in the future, which was not the case in the past. There is nothing inappropriate in organizing a Supreme Political Council, with President Chiang as chairman and Acting President Li as vice-chairman. The party leader in other countries is often the head of state, but this is not the case in China. The political council is purely an internal political organization of the party and has no relationship with the government's administration.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou to Various Places Telephone Charges Temporarily Reduced by Half</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] Electricity Bureau News: The long-distance telephone service between Guangzhou and Hong Kong has been changed to one silver dollar from this month's 6th. Now, in order to reduce the burden on users, the electricity bureau will temporarily reduce the domestic long-distance telephone charges by half, starting today. For example, the current charge for each Guangzhou to Jiangmen long-distance telephone call is one dollar and two jiao in silver dollars, which will be reduced to six jiao in silver dollars from today. The current charge for each Guangzhou to Shanghai long-distance telephone call is eight dollars and one jiao in silver dollars, which will be reduced to four dollars and five fen in silver dollars from today. Other places can be used as examples to maintain this. In addition, express telephones originally charged five times the urgent call fee, but now they are also reduced to five times the ordinary fee.</p>
<h3>Peking University, Tsinghua and Three Other Universities Separately Establish School Affairs Committees</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Peking, 6th Broadcast: Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Normal University have each established school affairs committees, with Tang Yongtong and 23 others, Ye Qisun and 21 others, and Li Jinxi and 19 others serving as members of the school affairs committees of the above three schools.</p>
<h3>Siamese Ambassador Still in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 5th] The Siamese Foreign Minister reported to the Cabinet meeting on the 4th that he had received a report from a senior official of the Siamese Embassy in China from Guangzhou, stating: Ambassador Apibal is still in Nanjing, and there is no way to communicate with him due to the interruption of telecommunications between Nanjing and Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Flew to Changsha Yesterday, Strongly Criticizing Local Peace Talks in Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 6th] Chief Executive Bai Chongxi and Chairman Zhang Zhen of Henan flew to Changsha for official business at noon on the 6th and are expected to return to Hankou tonight or tomorrow morning. The other side attaches great importance to Bai's trip. In addition, staff members of the Henan Provincial Government left in Hubei will move to Hengge for office within days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 6th] General Bai Chongxi arrived in Changsha today. According to what he told reporters: This trip is to visit Chairman Cheng and his old friend General Tang Shengzhi. Bai strongly criticized the brewing of local peace talks in Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi, saying that this is purely a communist plot to divide and poison, and emphasized the tragic situation encountered by Fu's unit in Peiping, which should serve as a factual lesson that local peace is unreliable. The communist bandits have no such thing as peace with the same unit except for individual slaughter. We should be especially vigilant. When discussing the issue of the joint defense of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi, he said that under the central government's governance, any local area should strengthen its anti-rebellion deployment, not limited to the joint defense of the three provinces. Regarding the overall war situation, the national army has major new deployments, and the situation will improve soon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 6th] The situation in Wuhan is relaxed on the surface but tense within. People in general, in view of the increasing atmosphere of war, are not as tranquil as before. The number of passengers evacuating by water and land routes has increased day by day. At the same time, a certain unit of the garrison tested land mines and artillery shelling on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Appeals in the United States for the Establishment of a Pacific Treaty; The Chinese People Hope for Moral and Material Assistance from the United States</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Trenton, New Jersey, 5th] Gu Weijun, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, appealed on the 5th for the establishment of a Pacific Security Treaty. Gu warned that if China falls into the hands of the communist army, all of Asia will be "reddened."</p>
<p>Governor Darrascott of New Jersey hosted a banquet for Gu on the 5th. At the banquet, Gu said, "The danger of the spread of communism is like a flood. To effectively prevent this danger, a complete levee must be built. If important parts are exposed and not protected, the entire levee may be shattered. The North Atlantic Treaty is to implement this basic purpose, but more such a series of treaties covering all important regions are needed. Letting any part of this region, such as China, be left to its fate is tantamount to making a large part of this necessary levee empty."</p>
<p>Gu also said: "When the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty have made great achievements in the path of peace, freedom, organization, and prevention of communist policy's important parts. If the same measures are implemented in Asia, the Far East, and other important regions, it will also produce favorable consequences in the long run. China's current crisis "is like a fire field" that must be extinguished. This is not for China's sake, but for the sake of freedom in Asia and world peace. If it is not stopped in time, the consequences will be disastrous."</p>
<p>"The Chinese people hope for moral and material assistance from the United States. Recently, some sectors in the United States seem hesitant about helping China and have many criticisms, but this is not something he can disclose publicly."</p>
<p>"According to him, the urgent task at present is not in the past but in the present and the future. Important issues can be dealt with from the standpoint of common interests to prevent and deal with the serious situation."</p>
<p>"Although the situation in China is serious, it is not too late to reverse it in time. He believes that American politicians, with their traditional friendship, lofty goals, and vast resources, are very conducive to helping China resolve the situation. The path of freedom and democracy is waiting to be measured and decided."</p>
<h3>A Hong Kong Police Boat Mutinies; Many Police Officers Are Killed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 6th] A British water police boat, its crew mutinied in Maos Bay on the 6th, killing at least five of its crew members, including two Europeans. A Chinese customs patrol boat heard the alarm and went to the scene, finding that the boat had run aground. The body of the patrol officer, Oliver, and another European were loaded back.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 6th] Two British patrol officers and one Chinese detective were shot and killed on the morning of the 6th while asleep in a police patrol boat outside Po Toi Island in Mirs Bay, 25 miles northeast of Hong Kong. The perpetrators then forced the already injured helmsman to drive the boat into Chinese territory, then disarmed the boat. The three victims were water patrol officers Oliver and Hebes, and Chinese patrol officer Wang Gen (transliteration). Mirs Bay is south of Dapeng Bay and is a well-known pirate area.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 6th] The Hong Kong Police Commissioner has offered a reward of HK$5,000 for the arrest of the perpetrators in the water police patrol boat mutiny case.</p>
<h3>Claim That the United States Intends to Recognize the Communist Chinese Regime; Acheson Strictly Denies It; Says There Are No New Soviet Sympathizers in the State Department</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Secretary of State Acheson on the 6th denounced as "absolutely false" a rumor that the Berlin blockade negotiations involved the United States accepting the Soviet Union's views on the China issue. At the time, Acheson was giving his opinion to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Democratic Senator McCarran quoted a newspaper editorial discussing this rumor and asked Acheson for his views. Acheson replied that this rumor was absolutely absurd. Regarding McCarran's statement that Soviet sympathizers in the State Department were drafting a solution to the Soviet issue, including recognizing the new government of the Chinese Communist Party, Acheson also categorically denied it, saying that there were no Soviet sympathizers in the State Department, nor was there such a plan.</p>
<h3>First Session of the Legislative Yuan After Moving to Guangzhou; Decides to Issue a Statement on the Current Situation; Consolidate the Military and Financial Strength of the Provisional Capital and Stabilize the People's Livelihood; Consults the Executive Yuan to Take Emergency Measures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] After the Legislative Yuan moved from Nanjing to Guangzhou, it held its first session on the 6th in the Guangdong Provincial Assembly Hall, attended by 209 legislators. According to the 6th session, it was the 17th meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan. At 9:30 AM, President Tong Guanxian announced the opening of the meeting. Legislators Chen Zifeng and others proposed that all members go to Huanghuagang to pay tribute to the Seventy-two Martyrs. This proposal was passed without dissent and then went to Huanghuagang for a public memorial service, led by President Tong to perform rituals, offer flowers, and pay respect. The meeting continued in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] The seventeenth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan was held in the Guangzhou Provincial Assembly Hall on the afternoon of the 6th, with 192 members present, presided over by President Tong Guanxian. Matters discussed: (1) Third reading and passage of the Organic Law of the Ministry of Interior. (2) Amending the County Organization Law to simplify county-level administrative agencies. (3) Simplifying the Organic Law of Courts at all levels. (4) Rescuing the current financial crisis to avoid complete collapse. (5) Amending the current Supervisory Law of the Control Yuan, the Organic Law of the Committees of the Control Yuan, and the Organic Regulations of the Supervisory Commissioner's Office of the Control Yuan.

<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] Legislator Xu Yuanquan and six others proposed a temporary motion at the 17th meeting of the Legislative Yuan, stating that the Legislative Yuan should issue a statement on the current situation to express its attitude towards the Chinese Communist Party. The resolution was passed, and five legislators, Xu Yuanquan, Yang Gongda, Bai Ruchu, Cheng Tianfang, and Deng Gongxuan, were appointed to draft the statement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] Legislator Xiao Zheng and six others proposed a temporary motion at the 17th meeting of the Legislative Yuan, which stated: It is proposed to consult the Executive Yuan to take emergency measures to consolidate the military and financial strength of the location of the provisional capital, stabilize the people's livelihood, and promote morale. Since the fall of the capital, Guangzhou has become the provisional capital of our country's government during this extraordinary period and the center of politics and military affairs. However, although the people of Guangdong are strong, they have supported the suppression of the rebellion and supplied military needs for many years, and their strength has long been exhausted. The local finances are already in a difficult situation, and the military strength is especially weak. If they are not quickly replenished, it will be difficult to establish the foundation for the anti-communist war. Therefore, it is specifically proposed that the Legislative Yuan resolve to consult the Executive Yuan to quickly take the following emergency measures and begin to implement them within one week so that they can adapt to the timing: (1) Order the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters to jointly compile nine armies with the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the central government will allocate equipment and funding for their establishment. (2) The national government will bear the expenses of the Guangdong Provincial Security Forces and quickly allocate equipment to replenish their strength to facilitate the suppression of bandits. (3) Various ministries of national defense, transportation, and economy will quickly allocate funds and jointly strengthen the airports, highways, telecommunications, bridges, and other military-related industrial facilities with the Guangdong Provincial Government. (4) Relevant ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan will assist the Guangdong Provincial Government in organizing and training the people to jointly assume the responsibility of the anti-communist war. All expenses will be borne by the central government. The resolution was passed and sent to the Executive Yuan for execution.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] Legislator Pan Chaoying and others proposed a temporary motion at the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 6th, requesting that Executive Yuan President He Yingqin report to the Yuan on the breakdown of the peace talks and the government's withdrawal from Nanjing. It was resolved that a Yuan meeting would be held on the morning of the 9th, and President He would be consulted to report to the Yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] Legislator Wen Lian and others proposed a temporary motion on the 6th, questioning the handling of Yuan affairs when withdrawing from Nanjing.

<h3>The Legislative Yuan Sends a Telegram to Acting President Li, Asking Him to Come to Guangzhou to Preside Over the Grand Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] Legislator Pan Lianfang proposed a temporary emergency motion at the 17th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 6th, which stated: The Communist Party is destroying peace and crossing the Yangtze River by force. The government is moving to Guangzhou, and Nanjing is withdrawing. At this time of serious national crisis, it is imperative that the whole country, from top to bottom, unite as one and unite in good faith. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek called on the people of the whole country in a communiqué a few days ago to boost their spirits, persevere, support Acting President Li in leading the national military and civilians to fight to the end, in order to save the country from danger and rescue our people from fire and water, and to repay the country's peril. Reported that Acting President Li is still recuperating in Guilin due to physical and mental fatigue and has not yet come to Guangzhou, resulting in the central government's important policies losing their center of gravity. The colleagues, in view of the difficult national affairs and the spread of the Red disaster, proposed a temporary emergency motion, respectfully asking the General Assembly to resolve to use the names of all members of the Yuan to represent the people of the whole country, and send a telegram to Acting President Li to come to Guangzhou on the same day to preside over the national plan. Is it appropriate? Please vote on the case. The resolution was passed and sent a telegram to Acting President Li. The original telegram stated: "Acting President Li in Guilin: Three months in office have been extremely diligent, and the current situation has been dangerous.

<h3>Editorial: Prevent Fires Before They Start!</h3>
<p>Recently, the people of Shanghai have been troubled by the current situation and can be said to be extremely worried and anxious, feeling at a loss. From top to bottom, everyone is nervously preparing for the worst. Unexpectedly, on May 4th, a fire of unprecedented scale in many years broke out out of nowhere, which was truly like encountering a headwind in a leaky boat; misfortunes never come singly. According to the mayor's broadcast and news from various newspapers, at 2:05 PM that afternoon, a fire broke out in Sujiajiao, Xinxijie, in the French Concession, and raged for four hours and ten minutes. Even at 6:15 PM, the embers had not yet been extinguished, resembling a pit of fire. More than 3,200 shanties were affected, leaving around 20,000 displaced victims. The burnt area exceeded 200,000 square meters, which is half the size of Zhongshan Park. The fire field stretched for over one mile, and more than a dozen factories of varying sizes were also destroyed by the blaze. Over 40 fire trucks were dispatched, and more than 500 firefighters participated in the firefighting efforts. Two pump trucks were burned, and a great number of water hoses were damaged. The burned corpses resembled charred wood, a truly tragic sight to behold.</p>
<p>Water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it. The same is true of fire; it can save lives, but it can also take them. Fire is an accidental disaster, but also a family disaster. Statistics are rarely seen in our country, so let us borrow those of the United States for reference. The United States participated in World War II for three years and eight months, during which the number of deaths in the army and navy reached over 270,000, and the number of injured exceeded 650,000. However, in the three years following the war, 118,000 people died due to accidental family incidents, 480,000 were permanently injured, and 17,450,000 suffered disabilities, incapacitation, or injuries that prevented them from working. Among family disasters, falls accounted for the highest number of deaths, totaling 16,000, followed by burns at 5,600. Asphyxiation ranked third at 2,000, while poisoning was fourth at 1,500. Gunshot deaths accounted for 1,200, and the remaining 57,800 deaths were due to other causes. The majority of deaths occurred among the elderly and children, with those over 65 years old accounting for 55% of the casualties, and children under 5 years old accounting for 18%. The annual losses from family disasters in the United States amounted to $550,000,000, but this figure only refers to wages, medical expenses, and insurance premiums.</p>
<p>China's population is three times that of the United States. If this kind of loss is calculated proportionally to the population, then the losses suffered by China each year due to family disasters would amount to $2.2 billion USD. If we could save this enormous sum, why would we still need to beg for American aid? The losses from this fire in Shanghai cannot be calculated to this day, and perhaps will never be accurately calculated. Isn't this a clear example of a huge financial loss? In addition to family disasters, there are also other accidental disasters. In the United States in 1943, the number of deaths and injuries could stretch from New York to San Francisco, with the number of deaths reaching 97,000, enough to form a city. The number of injuries equaled the population of New York and Chicago combined. The losses from injuries amounted to $4.9 billion USD, and 380,000,000 man-days were lost. Among these, automobile accidents caused 20,000 deaths and 800,000 injuries, while 32,000 deaths occurred in homes, with approximately 5 million injuries. In that year alone, the losses from family disasters amounted to $6 billion USD.</p>
<p>Medical science is advancing rapidly, and infectious diseases have been greatly reduced. Today, the rising mortality rate in Western societies is not due to lung disease, cholera, typhoid, or diphtheria, but to accidental injuries. In 1900, accidental injuries in the United States accounted for 65.4% of all mortality rates nationwide, ranking ninth in causes of death. By 1947, however, it had risen to fourth place, accounting for 71.2% of the mortality rate. Westerners also have a saying: "The more advanced the culture, the more unexpected disasters occur." This is true, because the more advanced the culture, the more inventions there are. For everything there are advantages and disadvantages. The invention of machines is a symbol of cultural progress, but careless use of machines can kill people. Automobiles help us travel incredibly quickly, but they also kill the most people. It is said that entering a street is like entering a tiger's mouth, and this man-eating tiger is the automobile. In civilized societies, the use of civilized products has already caused too much harm. In societies with less wisdom, the harm caused by the use of civilized products will certainly be even greater. This is true in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. The number of accidents involving ships, airplanes, and trains in China over the years is countless.</p>
<p>Speaking of fires in Shanghai, due to the high population density and accumulation of materials, the possibility of fire is greatest, and even a small spark can easily start a prairie fire. The severity of the disaster is greater than in any other city. There is no need to talk about fires that occurred too long ago. Taking recent situations into account, no one will forget the three major fires that occurred in January of this year. The first was the major fire on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei on January 6th, which destroyed five or six hundred grass-roofed houses. The second was the fire on Duojia Road in Nanshi on January 8th, which destroyed over two hundred shanties. The third was the major fire on Guangzhao Road on January 12th, which destroyed over six hundred shanties. The number of victims who were burned out of their homes and lost their families reached several thousand. This tragic picture, which is appalling and devastating, is now reappearing before our eyes. How can it not be alarming and terrifying! But the way to fight fire is to prevent it before it starts.</p>
<p>Safety education is a method of preventing problems before they occur. The more valuable life is, the more developed safety education is. The West has the slogan "Safety First." The establishment of a safety plan must involve everyone and must be implemented forcefully. Every family, neighbor, and colleague must abide by safety rules. Today, Shanghai urgently needs to implement safety education. Among safety measures, fire prevention is the most important. In Shanghai's past fires, 90% of them started in shanties. The Bureau of Public Works and the Police Department cannot shirk their responsibility. Let's not talk about the existing shanties for now. Why is the government turning a deaf ear to shanties that are being built? For example, countless shanties have been built by those relocated from Toutiao Bridge on Qimei Road. Two municipal schools have jointly requested the Police Department and the Bureau of Public Works to find a way to stop this, but the authorities have ignored them to this day. What is the reason for this? What is the municipal leader doing about this? This is just one example; there are probably many similar situations! To remove the chimney and move the firewood away from the stove is always better than working with scorched heads and singed eyebrows!</p>
<h3>Plot to Incite the "Fuxing" Cruiser Mutiny: Five Masterminds Executed by Firing Squad Today; Captain Chen Ganting's Conspiracy Exposed and Defeated</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At the beginning of last month, the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters received important intelligence that the Communist army in northern Jiangsu had dispatched senior personnel to Shanghai to incite a mutiny on the "Fuxing" cruiser. Given the gravity of the case, Commander-in-Chief Tang secretly ordered Police Chief Mao Sen of this city to be responsible for the investigation. After two weeks, the case was finally solved. The main culprits, Chen Ganting (current captain of the "Fuxing" cruiser of the Coastal Water Police of Jiangsu Province), Tang Xinmin (staff officer of the 9th Military Subdistrict of the Communist side), Li Derong (liaison officer of the 9th Military Subdistrict of the Communist side), Li Junshi (liaison officer dispatched by the Communist side to the "Fuxing" cruiser), and Qian Peijun (traitorous merchant), a total of five persons, were apprehended one after another. After separate interrogations confirmed the facts, they were submitted for approval of the death penalty and will be executed today. It is reported that Tang, Li, Qian, and the other three arrived in Shanghai from Nantong on the third of last month and secretly discussed a mutiny plan with Chen Ganting, captain of the "Fuxing" cruiser of the Coastal Water Police Bureau of Jiangsu Province, who had come to Shanghai from the Fushan defense area. The authorities dispatched personnel on the 9th to capture Tang and the other four at the Dongya and Southeast hotels respectively. After an all-night interrogation, it was learned that Chen Ganting had been in contact with Shi Yafu, chief of staff of the 9th Military Subdistrict of the Communist side, and had been receiving large monthly subsidies from the Communist side to plot wrongdoing. He also confessed that Chen resided at the Tianjin Apartment on Shunchang Road in this city. Personnel were dispatched on the afternoon of the 10th to apprehend Chen Ganting in front of the Yameng Grand Theater nearby. After interrogation, he confessed that he had known Shi Yafu since 1938. Soon after, they became sworn brothers due to their shared ideals. When the war shifted to the Jiangbian area, Shi dispatched liaison officer Li Derong with four taels of gold to contact him on the cruiser, hoping to act as an internal response when the Communist army crossed the river, and to contact other National Army troops not to obstruct the river crossing. If necessary, the "Fuxing" cruiser should take the lead in "uprising" to assist in the river crossing operation. Later, Shi sent Li Junshi to serve as a liaison and intelligence officer on his cruiser. At the beginning of April, he again sent staff officer Tang Xinmin, accompanied by merchant Qian Peijun, to the cruiser to investigate the number of the National Army stationed locally and the situation of the bridgeheads, and agreed to meet in Shanghai to discuss the mutiny plan, which was ultimately captured by the Shanghai Police Department.</p>
<h3>Chaotic Financial Market in Hankou: Over a Hundred Businesses Collapse</h3>
<p>[Report from Hankou, this Newspaper, 6th] The financial market here is becoming increasingly chaotic. The National Bank has released a large quantity of nickel coins and stipulated the exchange rate for nickel coins, but silver coin dealers are forcibly buying them at a 40% discount, causing both subsidiary coins and gold yuan to be abandoned. Market transactions have come to a standstill. Over a hundred financial businesses have collapsed. Although the authorities arrested silver coin dealers on the afternoon of the 6th, the chaotic financial situation has not been alleviated.</p>
<h3>Relaxation of Restrictions on Carrying Paper Money Out of Lanzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from Lanzhou, this Newspaper, 6th] The restriction on carrying paper money out of Lanzhou has been lifted, but gold and silver coins are still subject to inspection.

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation to Open Shaanxi-Guangdong Route</h3>

<h3>US Senator Calls for Restoration of Free Gold Market</h3>
<p>[Report from United Press, Washington, 5th] Democratic Senator McCarran today advocated restoring a free gold market in the United States, and denounced the current restrictions on private individuals buying and holding gold in the United States as "absurd." He asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to recommend the lifting of restrictions on gold trading and to continue the gold standard, with the Treasury Department purchasing gold at $35 per ounce. According to McCarran, the Treasury Department has purchased gold worth more than $3.7 billion in two years, 96% of which came from abroad. The Treasury Department has never explained what it intends to do with this huge amount of gold, nor has it formulated any policies. At this critical time, we should seriously consider the use and disposal of this gold. A free gold market can make exchange rates more volatile, help establish a sound monetary policy, and promote domestic and international stability.</p>
<h3>US Occupation Costs in Japan: 500 Million Dollars Annually; US Must Relieve This Burden</h3>
<p>[Report from United Press, London, 5th] According to sources in the American diplomatic community today, the United States has proposed to the Far Eastern Commission that "Japan be allowed to borrow foreign debts and enter into commercial and economic agreements with various countries." The Far Eastern Commission will discuss this, but it is heard that Britain and France have "firmly expressed their opposition." The British Foreign Office did not comment on this matter. It is understood that the US policy is to make the occupation forces only "a protective force," and to give as much authority as possible to the Japanese government. The cost of the US occupation of Japan is about 500 million dollars annually. If this burden is to be relieved, Japan must be able to borrow money, trade, and be self-governing. The reason why the United States has made concrete proposals to the Far Eastern Commission is precisely this.</p>

<p>Detailed Record of British House of Commons Debate on China Issue</p>
<p>[Report from United Press, London, 5th] The British House of Commons debated the situation in China on the 5th. The government stated that it was adopting a policy of non-interference in China, but the Conservative Party demanded that the government take action to prevent the spread of communism in the Far East.</p>
<p>[Report from United Press, London, 5th] During the House of Commons debate on the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River on the 5th, Defense Minister Alexander said that according to reports from those involved, the incident was an accident that later escalated, and was not deliberate or premeditated. Britain is eager to avoid interfering in the Chinese civil war, but will not show weakness with regard to territories for which we are directly responsible. The government is closely monitoring Hong Kong. Prime Minister Attlee also said in the House of Commons that the Communist army's shelling of British warships was not a planned action, and that the bombardment of foreign warships sailing upstream on the Yangtze River was possible. When Attlee mentioned a suggestion that the government should recognize the Chinese Communist Party, he said, "This matter must be judged based on the actions of the Chinese Communist Party. It is not the time to discuss this matter at present."</p>
<p>Conservative Party's Butler on Hong Kong's Defense</p>
<p>[Report from United Press, London, 5th] Butler, who has been repeatedly rumored to be the successor to the leader of the Conservative Party, concluded the House of Commons debate on the Chinese Communist army's shelling of British warships tonight by saying that the true defense of Hong Kong relies less on troops and more on mobilizing British diplomatic and strategic resources to unite the countries of the Far East as in the West. "I would like to see the United States, India, Italy, the Netherlands, and France come together to unite our strengths so that we can be guaranteed to have a treaty in the East to prevent war, as has already been seen in the West."</p>
<p>British Ambassador Still Staying in Nanjing, Macmillan Says Inappropriate</p>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] During the House of Commons debate on the Yangtze River incident on the 5th, Defense Minister Alexander said that the Chinese Communist authorities have so far refused all contact attempted by British consular officials. Conservative leader Macmillan attacked the government's mismanagement and inefficiency in handling the situation in China when the House of Commons began debating it this afternoon. Macmillan said: "I don't understand why the British ambassador needs to stay in Nanjing. The government should have recalled him long ago and left a chargé d'affaires to perform his duties." Referring to the Amethyst incident, Macmillan said: "It is unwise to send warships deep inland and far away from the outside world." He praised the courage of the British naval soldiers, but said: "This accident shows the decline of our strength and judgment." Macmillan continued by asking, "Will communism devour China, or will China annex communism? I believe that British trade still has a chance to carry out effective tasks in China."</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Army, Navy, and Air Force Troops Open to Hong Kong for Reinforcement</p>
<p>[Report from Reuters, London, 5th] Defense Minister Alexander recently told the House of Commons that Britain is sending a large number of reinforcements to Hong Kong, including army, navy, and air force troops, which will increase the British army in Hong Kong to two brigades, each brigade including three battalions, upon arrival. In addition, there are special forces, including tanks, field guns, anti-aircraft guns, flat-shooting gun units, etc. The air force reinforcement units include fighter planes. The naval fleet in Hong Kong will add a cruiser and, if necessary, an aircraft carrier. Alexander stated that although Britain is making every effort to avoid being involved in the war on the Chinese mainland, Britain will take a resolute attitude towards territories for which it is directly responsible. Hong Kong's policy of maintaining neutrality and non-interference in Chinese politics has a long tradition. The British government has always maintained a policy of non-interference in the Chinese civil war, while at the same time taking a very cautious attitude in Hong Kong. In deciding to protect Hong Kong with other measures, the British government's motives are solely to ensure that the unstable situation in China does not endanger the safety of the people of Hong Kong or impede the peaceful conduct of legitimate trade with China via Hong Kong. Alexander also mentioned Hong Kong's police force, saying that the local police force has now more than doubled compared to the 1,220 in 1941, and that the recruitment of the Hong Kong volunteer defense force is also underway, but the results have not been entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Traditional Neutral Policy Benefits All Parties</p>
<p>Talking about Hong Kong's traditional neutral policy, Alexander pointed out that both the Chinese Kuomintang and Communist parties have enjoyed the benefits of Hong Kong's neutral policy. The only condition they should abide by is to abide by Hong Kong law and not engage in actions that damage Sino-British relations. The steps currently being taken by the British authorities will be used to deal with any behavior that disrupts the living conditions of the Chinese in the area, whether Kuomintang or Communist, or disrupts peace. Regardless of how these disruptive behaviors are caused, in the public interest, it is currently inconvenient to disclose their details. Alexander also said that Hong Kong's food situation is generally satisfactory, with a very sufficient supply of rice. The authorities have also taken steps to prepare for food storage. Opposition spokesman MacLennan believed that the best way to defend Hong Kong is for the British government to clearly state that an attack on Hong Kong will be regarded as an act of aggression, with the necessary consequences. Hong Kong is the Gibraltar of the East and must be defended. Britain's major interests in Malaya and Singapore are closely related to Hong Kong. MacLennan emphasized that Britain has many friends in Asia, but they need comfort, so Britain must instill a spirit of trust in Asia, and the Western partnership system based on the American people must be able to extend to the East.</p>
<p>The Lister Shire Regiment of British Troops Scheduled to Open Hong Kong on the 11th</p>
<p>[Report from Reuters, London, 5th] War Office News: The Lister Shire Regiment, currently stationed in Leicester, will be the first troops to depart for Hong Kong for reinforcement and is scheduled to board the ship and set off on May 11. Following them will be a Royal Artillery regiment, a Royal Engineers unit, and two infantry battalions.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Attach Importance to the Issue of Strengthening Hong Kong's Defenses</p>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse, London, 6th] All newspapers here on the 6th published in a prominent position the news of strengthening Hong Kong's defenses during yesterday's House of Commons debate on the China issue. The Conservative "Daily Mail" said, "Indeed, we will own Hong Kong." The left-wing "Daily Mirror" ran a large headline saying, "Send planes, artillery, and troops to Hong Kong." The Conservative "Daily Express" asked: "Are sixty troops enough to defend Hong Kong?" The Times commented, "Defense Minister Alexander made a clear distinction between Britain's policy towards China and the policy taken towards territories for which Britain is responsible. In mainland China, British diplomatic and consular representatives are still staying in their posts and attempting to make contact with the Chinese Communist authorities to protect British citizens and their interests. The defense of Hong Kong and the maintenance of legitimate commerce are Britain's direct responsibilities. Therefore, measures have been taken to strengthen its internal security and send additional army, navy, and air force troops." The Conservative "Daily Telegraph" opposed a suggestion from a Labour MP that Britain should immediately recognize the Chinese Communist regime, saying, "We must not immediately recognize this Chinese Communist regime that massacred our navy and does not accept our protests." On the issue of recognizing the Chinese Communist Party, The Times said, "The Prime Minister said that the Chinese Communist Party will be judged by its actions. This is indeed a wise answer."</p>
<p>British Government Maintains Closest Contact with Consul General in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Report from Reuters, London, 5th] Defense Minister Alexander said during the House of Commons debate on the situation in China on the 5th that the British government has maintained the closest contact with the British Consul General in Shanghai on the measures that will be taken in an emergency. The purpose of these measures is to provide the British citizens there with the protection that is possible in the current environment and to allow them to evacuate when necessary and at their own will. Alexander also said that in addition to the military situation, the British government is also seriously concerned about the financial and economic situation in Shanghai. Although the final remedy for these situations should be taken by the Chinese, the local British citizens have been discussing this with the British Consul General in Shanghai. In short, the British government will continue to implement its peaceful policies and assist British citizens on the most possible basis.</p>
<p>British Broadcasting Corporation Suspends Broadcast of "Slow Boat to China" Song</p>
<p>[Report from United Press, London, 6th] The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) suspended broadcasting the popular song "Slow Boat to China" on the 6th for fear of touching the sorrow of the families of the sailors who died in the Yangtze River incident.</p>

<h3>Future Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference: U.S. Determined to Strive for a Proactive Position; Hopes to Resolve German and Austrian Issues Simultaneously; USSR May Suggest Dividing World Spheres of Influence</h3>
<p>[Report from United Press, Washington, 6th] According to several indications, senior diplomatic advisors are urging Secretary of State Acheson to take a proactive position in the Paris Four-Power Conference, otherwise the Soviet Union will use the conference to launch a major propaganda offensive against the German people. They believe that the Soviet Union may put forward the following three proposals: (1) Unify all of Germany under a central German government; (2) Accelerate the withdrawal of occupying forces; (3) Accelerate the completion of the final peace treaty with Germany. These three proposals will undoubtedly receive the support of German nationalists. It is clear that the State Department is drafting a plan to deal with and defeat the Soviet Union's proposal. Although it has not yet been completed, some officials pointed out that Western countries may ask the Soviet Union to agree to a peaceful settlement of the Austrian issue. This move would force the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops from Austria, Hungary, and Romania, and weaken the Soviet Union's power in the satellite countries of Southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>[Report from United Press, Washington, 5th] State Department spokesman McDermott revealed on the 5th that U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Jessup, who is responsible for the initial negotiations to lift the Berlin blockade, may accompany Secretary of State Acheson to Paris to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference on May 23. He said that the formal agenda of the meeting has not yet been finalized. He also said that the Austrian issue may be included in the agenda because it is related to the German issue.</p>
<p>[Report from United Press, Washington, 6th] A speculation arose in diplomatic circles on the 6th that the Soviet Union may propose a "secret agreement" to the United States at the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, formally dividing the world into two major spheres of influence. Observers with this view said that the Soviet Union may suggest: (1) The United States recognize the Chinese Communist regime, adopt a "hands-off" policy in China, and recognize China as a permanent sphere of influence for the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union will stop its divisive movements in Western Europe and agree to resolve the German and Austrian issues in a democratic manner. U.S. officials pointed out that this move would undoubtedly be rejected by Secretary of State Acheson, because the United States is absolutely opposed to any form of secret agreement.</p>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 5th] British occupation forces commander Robertson predicted at a press conference today that a German central government will be established soon. Robertson said that if the Four-Power Conference can proceed smoothly after the blockade is lifted, then the establishment of a pan-German central government is not far away. Robertson believes that under the provisions of the Bonn Constitution, Germans can obtain a peaceful, happy, and proud life, and hopes that the East German local government will be willing to participate in the federal government in accordance with the Bonn Constitution. This is not impossible. At the same time, the German Communist Party issued a declaration in Frankfurt, demanding the immediate cessation of work on the establishment of West Germany, pointing out that the German leaders who drafted the constitution in Bonn should not "undermine" the possibility of the success of the Paris Four-Power negotiations.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The Foreign Ministers of nine countries, namely England, France, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, along with the Belgian Ambassador, signed the charter establishing the European Parliament today.

The Consultative Assembly has 87 members: 18 each from England, France, and Italy; 6 each from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden; 4 each from Denmark, Norway, and Ireland; and 3 from Luxembourg. The Consultative Assembly may discuss any issue submitted by the Committee of Foreign Ministers, and a resolution is established if passed by a two-thirds vote of the members. Following the conclusion of negotiations for the establishment of the European Parliament, the following communiqué was issued, expressing the hope that the first meeting of the European Parliament would be convened in Strasbourg in August, and that this inaugural meeting would be the most significant event in European history.</p>
<p>Consider Membership of Greece and Turkey Acceptable: Regarding the requests of the Greek and Turkish governments to join the organization, the communiqué stated that these declarations were considered acceptable by the initiating countries and would be discussed after the establishment of a committee under the European Parliament. This committee will also study the possibility of other countries participating in the European Parliament. The communiqué also stated that the Foreign Ministers held the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee today under the chairmanship of Mr. Schuman, appointed Mr. Paris of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs as Secretary-General, and decided that the next meeting of the Preparatory Committee would be held in Paris on May 11. The communiqué also specifically stated that matters related to defense are not within the scope of discussion of the European Parliament.</p>

He emphatically stated that this was the greatest and the last opportunity to resolve disputes with the Soviet Union peacefully. He also accused the US government of deliberately not announcing the news that the Soviet Union had proposed lifting the Berlin Blockade to the US on March 21, to avoid hindering the establishment of the Atlantic Pact.</p>
<h3>US Zone in Germany Cracks Down on Illegal Communist Party Meeting</h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Propaganda Documents Seized</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 6th] Police in the American-occupied zone of Germany today cracked down on an illegal meeting of the Communist-aligned Socialist Unity Party, arresting 20 people and seizing a large quantity of Communist documents. These documents revealed the Soviet Union's possible intentions at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris: (1) to obtain a four-power agreement to permanently exclude Germany from the new European Federation and the Atlantic Treaty; (2) to abolish the regulations of the Western six countries on the control of the Ruhr industrial area and to recognize the Soviet Union's interests in the Ruhr region; (3) to abolish the major policies toward Germany adopted by the US, Britain, and France without the consent of the Soviet Union, including the establishment of the West German Republic; and (4) to establish an all-German government that will continue the "democratic measures" already implemented in the Soviet-occupied zone.</p>
<h3>No Need to Convene a Four-Power Summit</h3>
<p>President Truman's Statement</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] President Truman stated at his weekly press conference yesterday that there was currently no need to hold a four-power summit to resolve the dispute over the German question. If the Four-Power Foreign Ministers reach an agreement on the German question at their meeting in Paris at the end of the month, there will be no need to hold a four-power summit at all.</p>
<h3>Moscow's Reaction</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 5th] After Moscow Radio officially confirmed the news of the agreement reached by the four powers on the Berlin issue this afternoon, the Soviet people breathed a sigh of relief. Moscow Radio broadcast the full text of the agreement twice in a short period, and the general public opinion was that "this is the best news in the world for a long time. We initially thought that Western countries were unwilling to establish an agreement, but now it reveals real hope. We hope that the four powers can reach a broader agreement on Germany at the Foreign Ministers Conference." A taxi driver believed that the agreement was the result of General Clay's departure. Many Russians considered Clay to be the main obstacle to reaching an agreement on the German question.</p>
<h3>All of South Asia Has Felt the Earth Shaking</h3>
<p>US Editor Believes It Will Not Become Communist</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 6th] Isaacs, Deputy Editor of Newsweek, who has traveled in the East and recently returned to the country, published a special report in the magazine entitled "Will South Asia Become Communist?" It stated that before the Communist Chinese army crossed the river, all of South Asia had felt the earth shaking in China. Such shocks often cause panic in distant places. Newspapers in Manila have reported that unidentified vessels have transported Communist troops and armaments to the coast of Luzon. British police in Malaya said that the local Communist rebels are led by special personnel from China. French officials in Vietnam claimed that Communist troops have crossed the border and joined forces with the Viet Minh. Marshal Pibul Songkram of Siam has arrested dozens of overseas Chinese on charges of Communist conspiracy. All this should not cause paranoia or panic. The true facts have their own irresistible force.</p>
<h3>Gunfire in the Berlin Blockade Zone</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 6th] German police opened fire in the Soviet-locked Berlin today. This incident occurred six days before the scheduled lifting of the blockade.

West Berlin police also did not find any trace of the car.</p>
<h3>Two Notorious Nazi Generals Exempted from Trial</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Undersecretary Henderson declared in the Upper House yesterday that the British government believes that former Hitler's notorious generals Field Marshal Rundstedt and General Strauss are unfit to stand trial due to poor health, and will therefore be released without trial. Another Field Marshal, Manstein, is fit to stand trial and will be prosecuted. The three were captured by British forces after the war and are still in custody. British domestic public opinion has been critical of the long detention of the three men, who are all elderly, without a resolution.</p>

<p>Held a Press Conference in Switzerland, Pointing Out that Europeans Will Lose Influence in Asia</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Geneva, 5th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru left here on the 5th aboard an Air India flight to return to India.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bern, 5th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru today warned Europeans that they have "lost all their influence in Asia" and will likely lose influence in Africa. Nehru ended his three-day official visit today and told the press: "Whether the solution in Africa will be peaceful must be determined by the colonial rulers. India has united people of many different races without discrimination or oppression, and the rest of the world, especially Europe, which is often a 'source of unrest and war', must accept the same lesson. " Nehru met with Swiss Foreign Minister Petitpierre, exchanged ratification documents for the 1946 Indo-Swiss Friendship and Trade Treaty, and had lunch with members of the Swiss Cabinet. In the afternoon, he will travel by car to Geneva and is scheduled to fly from Geneva to India tonight.</p>

<h3>Gromyko Condemns Britain and the US for Establishing Bases in Spain, Supports Poland's Proposal to Ban Arms</h3>
<p>[Our Report] New York, 6th Broadcast: Lake Success Report, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko criticized in the UN Political Committee that Britain and the US are "actively transforming Franco Spain into a military base for war against the Soviet Union." Gromyko supported Poland's proposal, advocating that the United Nations should ban arms and weapons from being shipped to Spain. Gromyko said that Poland pointed out that the United States has built 70 air force bases in Spain and has transported a large amount of military equipment to Spain to equip the country's armed forces, which the United States has not denied. Gromyko further questioned whether the United States and Spain have a secret military agreement.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 5th] The UN Political Committee received a Polish proposal on the 5th, requesting an arms embargo against Franco Spain and freezing the current Spanish government in diplomatic isolation. Polish representative Katz-Suchy declared that the "underground movement" of Latin American countries to abolish the UN resolution to sever diplomatic relations with Spain has now surfaced.</p>
<p>Brazil and other Latin American countries submitted a proposal on the 4th, requesting that UN member states restore diplomatic relations with the Franco regime in Spain. He said that based on this, Poland had to put forward the following suggestions: (1) Request that all UN member states comply with the UN resolutions on the Spanish issue in letter and spirit. (2) Recommend that all member states ban the export of arms and any military supplies or strategic raw materials to Spain. (3) Urge all member states not to conclude any agreements or treaties with Spain. (4) Reiterate that the United Nations is only willing to accept Spain as a member and welcome its participation in special agencies after Spain has rebuilt a democratic government. (5) Instruct the Security Council to constantly monitor Spanish actions. It is speculated that both Poland and Brazil's proposals will inevitably fail.</p>

<h3>Boxing King Performs in the Philippines: Like a Lion Fighting a Rabbit</h3>
<p>Two Consecutive Matches Cause the Audience to Laugh</p>
<p>[United Press Manila, 5th] Boxing King Joe Louis gave an exhibition match last night at the Rizal Memorial Stadium here, fighting three rounds each against California boxer Joe Stevens and U.S. Army heavyweight boxing champion Willkin. Joe Louis weighed 215 pounds, and his opponents were far from his match. Therefore, Joe Louis deliberately did not punch with force to avoid knocking out or injuring his opponents. In the first round of the fight between Joe Louis and Stevens, who weighed 205 pounds, Louis kept forcing his opponent to defend. Stevens bravely counterattacked, but to no avail. Joe Louis punished his opponent with a left punch, and then punched Stevens' face and body with both left and right punches, like a rain of fists. Stevens was bleeding from his nose when the match ended. In the second fight, his opponent Willkin weighed only 190 pounds and was slender. Joe Louis stopped attacking Willkin near the end of the first round. Thereafter, Joe Louis fought in a clown-like manner, causing laughter and applause. Joe Louis was once lightly hit in the face and deliberately bent his legs, causing his knees to touch the ground, and then turned his face to smile at the audience, causing the crowd to laugh even more. There were 25,000 spectators last night.</p>

<h3>The British Labour Party</h3>
<p>– By G.D.H. Cole, Translated by Song Guihuang</p>
<p>In the early days, the question was often raised: these new figures, only a few of whom had any concept of administrative responsibility in their early lives, did they have the administrative capacity required for government? We must not forget that many, even most, members of the Labour Party had been trained in local government. However, in the early days of the two cabinets in which Labour was a minority party, there were disappointing signs. It was common for an inexperienced cabinet member, surrounded by administrative experts, to forget what his constituents expected of him. Despite these shortcomings, the Labour Party had a democratic tool in its weekly meetings that the old parties did not. Although the Prime Minister and the entire cabinet were ultimately responsible, policy and performance reports were reviewed by the entire party in these meetings, giving every comrade an opportunity to participate in criticism. The Labour Party is far more committed to a unified democratic system than the other two parties. It certainly relies less on the temperament and authority of the party leader. This has been especially true since MacDonald left office in 1931. Although the Labour Party's prestige suffered a temporary loss at the time, it was able to maintain unity and, after the blow of MacDonald's departure, became even more motivated.</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke sees Peel as the typical British Conservative, while my friend Hammond sees Gladstone as the typical Liberal. In my view, Attlee is the most respectable figure in the Labour government. But he belongs to the era of the pioneers. His politics can be compared to Mahatma Gandhi. In terms of loyalty and a sense of justice, Henderson is the epitome. He also embraced a generous international outlook, and after taking over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he resolutely followed all the resolutions passed by the Labour Party Congress, without exception.</p>
<p>The Theoretical Basis</p>
<p>Finally, I must mention a crucial question: What is the content of the socialism put forward by the Labour Party? It has neither a clearly defined creed nor an orthodox party platform. Various schools of thought, such as the Fabians, Guild Socialists, and Marxists, all have their place in the Labour Party. Morris, Carpenter, and Hobson created theories for the Labour Party in the past thirty years. Tawney, Cole, and Laski are creating theories for it in this era. It accepts the public heritage that our ancestors fought for and won for us, namely the traditions of civil liberties and freedom of speech. What it rejects is the laissez-faireism, profit motive, and belief in free enterprise of the nineteenth century. It is easier to describe its goals than to describe its doctrines.

<h3>The Leader of the Broadsword Gang Finally Reaps the Bitter Fruit: Little Changgen Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday; Two Volunteer Police Officers in Yangjing District Executed for Conspiracy</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Police Department executed Xu Shouhuai, the leader of the Broadsword Gang in this city, at Lao Beimen at 10:00 AM yesterday. Xu, a native of Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, was 29 years old, nicknamed Little Changgen. He was known for his rampant behavior in Shanghai, extorting, looting, and killing. The cases reported by victimized merchants numbered in the dozens. He was extremely wicked and feared by the people like a tiger, hence the nickname "Unkillable Changgen." The major crimes he committed included the theft and sale of military rice from the United Logistics Headquarters in November 1948, the gathering of crowds for armed fights and the robbery of police officers' pistols in the South City on February 3 of this year, and the gathering of crowds for brawls in the Deyilou restaurant in the City God Temple on February 22. In addition, he frequently incited his followers to force sales to fruit and dry goods stores in the Shiliupu area, and recently colluded with bandits to plot riots. He was arrested recently and confessed to all charges during interrogation. The Police Department, considering that the suspect dared to violate martial law during this period of martial law, was undoubtedly guilty of unforgivable crimes. With the approval of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, he was executed by firing squad, with Wu Futang, the chief of the Criminal Division of the Police Department, supervising the execution.</p>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] At 4:00 PM yesterday, the Police Department also executed two "defection specialists" dispatched by the Communist Party's Agile Column, Zhang Meifang (21 years old, Shanghai native) and Pan Hualong (24 years old, Shanghai native), volunteer police officers in the Yangjing District, at the Song Park Road execution ground. The execution was supervised by the newly appointed Chief Inspector Du Chun. After the two criminals were arrested, they confessed to having been "ordered" to come to Shanghai to plan the incitement of all volunteer police officers to prepare for the Communist army's attack on Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Mainland Trains Fully Booked: Peddlers Busy Trading Back and Forth</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Shenhe section is still open, and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is still operating as usual.

Therefore, the Shanghai-Lujiabang passenger trains have been fully booked for days. The long-silent North Station has regained its vitality.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency] Recently, with the public utility pricing index rising repeatedly, citizens feel increasingly unable to bear the burden and have appealed to the Municipal Council for rectification. The council has scheduled a meeting of the Public Utilities Subcommittee for 3:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the matter, and has invited councilors who are not members of the subcommittee to attend as well.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, believes that the wages earned by workers throughout the city are only 370,000 times, while the public utility index announced on the 5th has risen to 950,000 times, making it unbearable for ordinary workers and affecting public life, and that there is a risk of collapse for industrial and commercial businesses. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Municipal Council suggesting that it be stopped immediately. Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Textile Industry Association of the Six Districts, also stated that the public utility index exceeds general prices. The industry uses the most electricity. If alternative measures are not promptly considered, factories throughout the city will quickly collapse, and the consequences will be disastrous. He specifically sent a letter to the Municipal Council explaining his views.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since all sectors of the city unanimously requested the correction of the public utility index, which has been rising crazily, this reporter specially sought the opinion of Mr. Xu Jigu, Vice-Chairman of the Municipal Council, yesterday. Mr. Xu also stated that the index is indeed too high, but the Municipal Council's Public Utilities Subcommittee is scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th, and he will also attend at that time. He believes that the committee will definitely find a solution to this problem. Therefore, before the subcommittee reaches a resolution, he is unwilling to comment much on the matter.</p>
<p>A Reader's Letter Points Out Several Extremely Unreasonable Points</p>
<p>A reader, Chen Zhi, wrote to this newspaper stating: After the daily adjustment of fees for public utilities based on the price index, the companies are indeed making profits every day, which is ten thousand times better than the previous so-called Guan Yuan pricing, so they no longer need to pretend to be poor and complain. What is suffering are still us, the users. The writer believes that there are several extremely unreasonable points in this method of pricing based on the price index, and requests that the municipal authorities urge the public utility companies to make improvements: (1) Daily adjustment of fees according to the price index is certainly the most profitable method for the companies, but the first unreasonable point is, for example, on the first day of implementing the price index-based fee collection, the index was 140,000 times, and the index on the day before yesterday had risen to 950,000 times. If it rises to who knows how many times in a month, and after paying for a full month, based on the bill, the fee is paid according to the index on the payment date, assuming that the index on the payment date is 20 million times, may I ask, is it reasonable to pay for the water and electricity used when the index was 140,000 times at a price of 20 million times? If the companies believe that the price increase is too large and it is necessary to implement price index pricing, then they should read the meter and collect fees every day, which is the correct thing to do. If they believe that reading the meter and collecting fees every day is troublesome, that is the responsibility of the company. They want to obtain this undue profit, so they force users to delay paying once. Users have the right to refuse this extra burden. This method of enriching a few at the expense of the many is absolutely unreasonable and should be completely abolished, and a proper fee collection method should be established. (2) Shanghai has many lanes, and most lanes only have one water meter. The water bill is distributed to the households. If there are twenty or thirty households in a lane, it is impossible to collect all the money in one day. Even if it is collected in one day, the index will have adjusted the price the next day. May I ask how to distribute and collect the money? As a result, disputes arise repeatedly, and complaints are everywhere. The authorities should also set a standard payment period for these public users in order to be reasonable. (3) There are still doubts as to whether the accounts of the various companies are accurate. It is said that the French Concession Water and Electricity Company employs sixty foreigners, whose salaries can抵到抵到三千個中國工人, and this abnormal phenomenon should be thoroughly investigated by the municipal authorities. Whether the accounts of the various companies have been falsely reported or inflated should also be strictly audited.</p>
<h3>Public Utility Index Drops for Two Days, Today at 830,000 Times</h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, the current public utility meter index is "830,000 times". It is found that the public utility index has been rising sharply in recent days, and has only fallen twice in a row yesterday and today.</p>

<h3>A Comprehensive Discussion on the American Democratic Party (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Translated by Song Guihuang</p>
<p>Although the American Republican Party is known as the "Grand Old Party," it is actually only reaching the vigorous middle age of ninety-four. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, has reached the age of one hundred and fifty-six, and is clearly the oldest political party in the United States that has been active without interruption, almost the same age as the United States. As early as in Washington's cabinet, when Jefferson and Hamilton were engaged in fierce struggles, the life of the Democratic Party had already begun. Although Hamilton's Federalist Party later reincarnated repeatedly under the names of the Whig Party and the Republican Party, it only lived for thirty years. Only the life of Jefferson's party has never been interrupted. Although this party is weak and sickly, it possesses a vitality that allows it to survive to this day, although it has experienced wars, recessions, political failures, and even political victories.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the Democratic Party has recently been in power for sixteen years, but its internal divisions are very serious. When the national congress was held in 1948, it almost fell apart; because of the election campaign, it aroused all kinds of fierce trends of mutual attacks and slander within the party. For example, New York Mayor O'Dwyer and Mississippi's John Rankin, as well as Huntley and Bulwinkle, had little in common between them except that they did not support Truman's nomination. Those in the United States who support the Democratic Party and organized workers usually support the Democratic Party, but the most enthusiastic schemers and labor abusers also support the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Even in terms of foreign policy, although the majority of Democrats are internationalists, no one can ignore the poisonous isolationists such as Wheeler and O'Daniel. Even Franklin D. Roosevelt, who possessed political genius, found it difficult to bring these people together. Now, the Democratic Party is almost fragmented. Some party members followed Wallace and the pro-Communist faction onto the old path of the Progressive Party, while others followed the unrepentant traitors of South Carolina Governor Thurmond and his ilk. The remaining members, consisting of Southern moderates, New Dealers, big business tycoons, and simple democrats, are temporarily and reluctantly united to take joint action. Does this extraordinary political alliance have any real meaning?</p>
<p>Madison of Virginia is the father of the American Constitution. He once famously said: "The most common and durable source of factions has always been the various and unequal distribution of property." He also said: "The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern Legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the Government."</p>
<p>What were the class interests in Madison's time? Some people were centered around industry and commerce, that is, the bourgeoisie and creditors, commercial capitalists and financial capitalists. These people intended to control Hamilton's party, and because of the rise of Hamilton's Federalist Party, the remaining members in Madison's ranks - that is, landowners, debtors, and the proletariat - were in an opposing position. Thus, Jefferson's party arose to speak for the non-industrial and commercial members. Since then, the Democratic Party has always adhered to this task and has not changed its attitude.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the 1860s, the Democratic Party lost a lot of support from the people of the North because the slaveholders were in power in the party; and afterwards, it permanently failed to regain the support of the Northern farmers, except occasionally in the short term, when the Northern farmers had to support Bryan and Franklin D. Roosevelt because of low grain prices. But since the Civil War, the Democratic Party has gradually restored its old model, that is, a mixed union of Southern conservative farmers, Northern liberals, organized workers, and industrial and commercial leaders in the cities.</p>
<p>Jefferson and Hamilton, when Washington was president, one served as Secretary of State and the other as Secretary of the Treasury. Jefferson said that these two people were "like two cocks in a coop," but the rivalry between the two was not merely a personal struggle. Hamilton intended to establish a strong central government, whose tax policies would win the support of industry and commerce. He felt that the capitalists must be won over, and he did not trust the common people. He once said at the Constitutional Convention: "The common people are turbulent and changing, and their judgments and decisions are rarely correct."</p>
<p>But Jefferson sympathized with the Southern farmers, fearing that a centralized government would allow capitalists to exploit the farmers. He advocated limiting the power of the federal government and safeguarding the rights of the states. He also proposed that the people are the ultimate reservoir of power and the ultimate judge of administrators. Jefferson felt uneasy from this point of view. On May 13, 1793, when Washington's second term had not yet lasted long, Jefferson wrote a reproachful letter to the president, in which he first proposed the name of his party. He said: "The Republicans who want to maintain the existing government system are fewer in number than the monarchist Federalists."</p>
<p>Today's Democratic Party, which was called the Republican Party at that time for thirty years, is smaller in number, but its members are willing to continue to fight. He still regards Jefferson as a great political leader because he has an unparalleled understanding of the value and goals of democracy. Jefferson's principles, as Lincoln later said, are "the definition and principle of a free society." He not only possessed great philosophy, but also extraordinary talent, and was an energetic politician. Even before writing the letter to Washington, he had personally visited New York to promote the unity of Southern agriculturalists and Northern industrial and commercial leaders. For example, Burr, the leader of the Tammany Hall, later became a powerful Jeffersonian. Jefferson's theory is already commonplace to us today.</p>
<p>In the election of 1800, because Jefferson was well prepared, the Republican Party (that is, the Democratic Party) seized power. When this hated Virginian took office as president, the Federalists only trembled. In New England, women even hid their ornaments for fear that the new government would confiscate them. Theodore Dwight, a Federalist from Connecticut, declared that the country was ruled by wicked people and fools. He cried out like a madman: "Wives and husbands, and all their happiness, are in ruins; our wives and daughters are reduced to concubines; our children are orphaned. Is there any situation that our imaginations can paint, so dreadful, as this side of hell?"</p>
<p>But since taking office as president, Jefferson has shown an attitude of reconciliation from the beginning. In his inaugural address, he said, "We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists." Once he seized power, his claim to fight for the rights of the states and strictly abide by the Constitution was withdrawn. He indicated that the Constitution could be accommodated when necessary, such as the purchase of Louisiana. In other words, fighting for state rights was a secondary issue for Jefferson, while the most important thing was his desire to achieve the basic goals of the country. Many Federalists changed their allegiance to the Republican Party because of the moderation of Jefferson's policies, such as John Adams. By 1820, the Federalist Party had perished.</p>
<p>After Jackson took office as president in 1829, the history of the party entered a new stage. Jackson was a powerful and decisive leader who did not fear anyone and was convinced of his policies. As a result, he changed the entire nature of the presidency. His reputation is active in history. On the day he took office, the masses poured into the White House to receive his hospitality, but his contributions were more real. His strengthening of the power of the chief executive set a precedent for later presidents, which has been followed to this day.</p>
<h3>Beryllium—A Substitute for Steel</h3>
<p>— Pei Jun</p>
<p>As early as 1827, people discovered that beryllium was an element. It was not until more than twenty years ago that metallurgists began to experiment with it. It is mostly produced in the Western Hemisphere, and the United States is currently the most prosperous. It is distributed from Maine to Georgia, and in places such as North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada, California, New Mexico, and Arizona.</p>
<p>We usually think that metals will gradually lose their effectiveness under pressure. In the industrial world, this problem is very serious. Now, various machines have to work at high speeds, so the entire factory wheels may have to stop. Therefore, we should quickly use a metal that can maintain its original properties under constantly increasing pressure in every important place to make springs and complex parts of machines. In fact, "beryllium copper" is exactly what is needed.</p>
<p>Beryllium has the properties of metal, is one-third lighter than aluminum, but is harder than steel. However, although it is hard under a certain pressure, it is very brittle and will break when dropped on the ground. After research by many metallurgical experts, a mysterious discovery was finally made. Adding 2% to beryllium copper and heating it can harden the copper, just like the hardening of steel. Later, the tensile strength of their alloy was tested, and it only stopped rising when it reached 185,000 pounds per inch. In other words, a beryllium copper rod with a diameter of half an inch can lift something weighing twenty tons.</p>
<p>In addition to its tensile strength, beryllium copper also has other useful properties. Workers in oil refineries and munitions factories use hammers, chisels, and shovels made of beryllium copper, which will not produce sparks like iron, thereby causing accidental combustion.</p>
<p>The steel buckles on parachutes often cause the magnetic compasses on airplanes to deflect, so beryllium copper is now used instead. Machines that must work in humid areas or near salt or other corrosive chemicals are also often made of beryllium copper, because it does not rust or corrode.</p>
<p>In fact, all new aviation machinery, including the most sophisticated drivers, contain beryllium copper - which makes them very accurate even in the worst environments. The new altimeter relies entirely on a moving rust plate, and it knows as soon as the air pressure changes, and it is durable. Modern transport planes and bombers have more than a hundred parts made of beryllium, and they will never lose efficiency due to long use.</p>
<p>Hospitals, laboratories, factories, power plants, and the linings of ships all use springs and diaphragms that are similar to those used in aviation. Automobiles and electric trams are also starting to use beryllium - wherever high speed or very strenuous work is required, it is used.</p>
<p>X-rays can pass through pure beryllium, so it is used as a window on X-ray tubes. Doctors use it as a target on their atomic analysis machines.</p>
<p>Beryllium oxide has important uses. Fluorescent lamps - which are the most similar to sunlight artificially - are coated with beryllium oxide. The magical screen of the newly invented radio transmission technology is also coated with beryllium oxide. The magical screen of the newly invented radio film art is also coated with beryllium oxide.</p>
<p>The term beryllium may be unfamiliar to some people. But we often have the opportunity to use it: it can make us comfortable, safe, and save money. Because with beryllium, steel can be replaced. At the same time, the parts can be used four or five times longer.</p>
<h3>Imminent Lifting of the Berlin Blockade; Airlift Operations Not Intended for Interruption</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 6th] The Four Powers issued a joint communique on the 5th regarding the lifting of restrictions on commercial traffic within Germany and the convening of a Foreign Ministers' Conference in Paris:</p>
<p>The Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have reached the following agreement:</p>
<p>(1) All restrictions imposed by the Soviet Government since March 1, 1948, on traffic, transportation, and trade between Berlin and West Germany, and between the eastern and western zones, will be lifted on May 12, 1949.</p>
<p>(2) All restrictions imposed by the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, or any one of them, since March 1, 1948, on traffic, transportation, and trade between Berlin and the western zones, and between West Germany and East Germany, will also be lifted on May 12, 1949.</p>
<p>(3) Eleven days after the lifting of the aforementioned restrictions, that is, on May 23, 1949, a Foreign Ministers' Conference will be convened in Paris to discuss the German problem and the problems arising from the Berlin situation, including the Berlin currency issue.</p>
<p>When Foreign Secretary Bevin read the above communique in the House of Commons on the 6th, he announced that he would travel to Berlin on the 7th to inspect the airlift operations, and at the same time convey the British government's gratitude and congratulations to all meritorious personnel. Referring to the lifting of the blockade, Bevin said: "The British government welcomes the conclusion of the aforementioned agreement. The House may understand that the breakdown of the Four Powers' discussions on the German problem was not our responsibility, as we have always been willing to consult with other occupying powers on the German problem. However, discussions could not proceed while the blockade continued, but now the blockade is about to be lifted." Bevin then pointed out that the firm and reasonable policy pursued by the British government has now been militarily vindicated. When dealing with new issues at the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference, the British government will adhere to the same firm and reasonable spirit as in the past, which can be guaranteed. The Foreign Secretary finally stated that the Berlin airlift will not be interrupted until the situation is completely clarified.</p>
<p>A British Overseas Airways Corporation "Short Solent," the latest model seaplane, landed on the Thames River in the form of a swan plunging into a waterfall on the morning of the [date missing] to celebrate the 30th anniversary of British commercial aviation. This is the first time in 21 years that Londoners have seen a seaplane on the river. Sir Irving, the Lord Mayor of London, will name the plane "City of London" next week. In August 1928, another Short seaplane, the "Calcutta," landed between Vauxhall and Lambeth Bridges, but it was much smaller compared to this aircraft.</p>
<p>British Overseas Airways Corporation now uses Constellation aircraft on the London-Sydney route, a distance of 12,000 miles, and the flight time has been reduced to less than four days.</p>
<p>Due to the lifting of night flight restrictions in Egypt, British Overseas Airways Corporation has been able to change its flight schedule. When flying from London to Sydney, there is an overnight stop in Cairo and a three-and-a-half-hour stop in Karachi. Previously, there was an overnight stop in Rome and a 17-hour stop in Karachi. The other overnight stop remains Singapore.</p>
<p>When flying from Sydney back to London, there is a brief stop in Cairo before flying to Rome for an overnight stay.</p>
<p>Many British manufacturers and leading industrialists are part of the Hong Kong trade delegation to the exhibition. Colonial Under-Secretary Rees-Williams gave a speech praising Hong Kong's post-war recovery. He said that the British government has allocated £1 million for Hong Kong's construction, half for the development of fisheries and agriculture, and the other half for urban construction. According to someone who recently returned from Hong Kong, he was deeply impressed by the implementation of Hong Kong's fisheries plan. He also praised the medical services. He pointed out that there were only 3,000 students in Hong Kong at the time of liberation. By the end of 1946, the number of students had exceeded the pre-occupation figure. In addition, Hong Kong's commercial figures have also broken all records. In 1948, the total value of import and export trade reached £230 million. Hong Kong can be called an oasis of peace and prosperity in a turbulent world, and the British are determined to maintain this position of Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Reader Inquiries, Legal Interpretations, Good Things Take Time: "Incurable" Disease Hinders Auspicious Date, Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi</h3>
<p>Cai Wenbin asks: My son was engaged to a certain lady through a matchmaker last August, and a wedding banquet was scheduled for this spring. Unexpectedly, the lady contracted a lung disease after the engagement, and the other party demanded that all medical expenses be borne by our side, which we did not agree to. The other party now intends to sell all the jewelry from our side to cover medical expenses. May I ask what should be done if the other party disregards everything and sells the jewelry?</p>
<p>[Answer] In law, there is indeed a provision for divorce in the case of incurable diseases (termination of the contract is even more permissible), but the so-called incurable disease must be confirmed through a "prohibition of disposal of property" procedure and cannot be determined solely based on a doctor's certificate. According to the development of modern medicine, lung disease is not necessarily incurable. This point, if litigated, will definitely be disputed by both parties.</p>
<p>As for the expenses for the woman's medical treatment after the engagement, unless she is a daughter-in-law being raised in the family, it seems that the man cannot be forced to bear them. This refers to the old-fashioned family. If it is a new-style of freedom, even friends should have a sense of mutual assistance, and an unmarried fiancé should be even more so.</p>
<p>Once engagement gifts are delivered, their ownership seems to have been transferred. Even if the contract is terminated and compensation can be demanded, it does not necessarily have to be the original object. Therefore, if the other party disposes of it, it cannot constitute grounds for prosecution.</p>

<h3>Japanese Palace Secrets: Palace Maidens' Symposium Hosted by "Truth Society"</h3>
<p>Sexually Perverted Old Palace Maids</p>
<p>This Newspaper: When we think of palace maids, we really want to know a little.</p>
<p>A: Palace maids are divided into five classes. The highest is equivalent to a senior civil servant, followed by recommended, appointed, employee, and maid. When I was in the palace, there were more than 100 maids alone. The dormitory was at the foot of Hongye Mountain.</p>
<p>B: Yes, but men are prohibited from entering and exiting. However, male teachers sent by kimono shops to teach embroidery and decoration can still enter and exit.</p>
<p>C: When a palace maid is promoted to senior rank, she has seven maids to serve her. Even with their serving maids, they have to distinguish the ranks for every stroke.</p>
<p>D: The palace rules do not allow palace maids to marry. The only men they can approach in the palace are the adjutant officers, who are young and burly. The palace maids secretly fall in love with them, especially the high-ranking middle-aged palace maids, who love to chat with them all day long. "Can I be your dear mother?" They are so nauseatingly in love with the adjutant officers. Sometimes, when they don't have money, they even sell their own hats to give the money to them for use. (Bitter smile)</p>
<p>E: I know that some adjutant officers also hate these middle-aged palace maids and often avoid them to avoid being nagged. (Laughter)</p>
<p>For a short period, almost every night was like this. When we were about to sleep, the palace maid would call and say she had something she wanted me to do. I had to bite the bullet and walk down that gloomy corridor. Fortunately, a "guardsman" soldier with a gun was added to the corridor in a few days, otherwise I would have been so scared that I would have gotten sick. Whenever I turned the corner and walked into the palace maid's bedroom, she always tried to put together something for me to do, taking the opportunity to chat with me. Once, we talked about the gas not being able to be turned off. As a result, I turned it off with a slight push. (Laughter) I said I had to go, but she insisted on holding you back, with a pair of bewitching eyes, it was really hideous. (Laughter)</p>
<p>B: Old palace maids in their forties and fifties still dress up in gaudy and strange ways, like the old women from the Matsumoto, Matsuo, and Sando groups.</p>
<p>C: The old woman Matsumoto, who wears glasses, is an old monster. She was promoted from a midwife to a recommended palace maid and is a famous "hysteric" in the palace.</p>
<p>D: Almost all the old palace maids have a bit of sexual perversion. Matsuo often wanted me to talk to her in her room. As long as Sando coughed outside the door, Matsuo would angrily go out the back door. As soon as the old glutton Sando came in, she would ask me all sorts of questions about how I was talking to Matsuo and what we were talking about. It was really annoying, but I couldn't get angry. (Laughter)</p>
<p>B: The young lower-ranking palace maids are also unable to properly solve their sexual problems, so they are all mentally depressed and pale. It's really pitiful. (Sigh)</p>
<p>Hirohito Studies Microbiology</p>
<p>This Newspaper: What is the emperor's life like during his time at the detached palace?</p>
<p>B: Miss C has more opportunities to go hunting with the "Emperor," please speak first. (Applause)</p>
<p>C: I have been to Hayama and Nasu with him. Local government officials and people have to come to pay their respects. Afterwards, the "Emperor" leads a dozen armed adjutant officers to the mountains to find mossy stones or to the beach to collect shells.</p>
<p>This Newspaper: Does the "Emperor" do it himself?</p>
<p>B: The attendants do it, he just points and gestures at this and that. (Laugh)</p>
<p>This Newspaper: What is Miss C's job at that time?</p>
<p>C: At that time, I was in charge of delivering the "Emperor's" meal (as well as dairy products and black tea) to the mountains or the beach. The plate of white rice had to be held above the eyes and carried for two or three miles. I always felt that this "imperial rule" was too cruel.</p>
<p>This Newspaper: If you carry the meal for two or three miles, won't dust get in?</p>
<p>C: There are lids covering them. The most hateful thing is that the things I send have to be held eight points high above my eyes, and I have to hang a teapot full of black tea on my wrist. Carrying it like this for two or three miles is so tiring that I can barely support myself. (Astonishment)</p>
<p>This Newspaper: What does the "Emperor" do in Hayama?</p>
<p>D: Go to Hayama Bay, take a motorboat and wander around. Sometimes he picks up shells on the rocky beach. It is said that there are no rare shells in Hayama, but the "Emperor" likes Hayama. (Laughter)</p>
<p>This Newspaper: It is said that the "Emperor" is very fond of collecting microbial materials, is that right?</p>
<p>D: Yes, when going to Hayama, the attendants always carry the "Imperial Microbial Material Collection Box."</p>
<p>This Newspaper: Are the microbial materials found taken back to the laboratory for research?</p>
<p>E: A "Imperial Microbial Special Research Institute" has been specially set up in Hayama. It is said that the equipment is extremely complete. An elderly eye doctor is often in charge of researching the "Emperor's microbiology" there. The Emperor sometimes goes to the laboratory to "research" during the time between his afternoon exercise and dinner. As for how much he can research, I am a layman. In short, although the "Emperor" who enters the laboratory poses as a scholar, the adjutant officers often say behind his back that he has a big head and is flustered. (Laughter)</p>
