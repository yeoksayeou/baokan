<h3 id="c1">低氣壓下閣總辭繼任人選在張羅中　李代總統已邀請何應欽 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕接近李代總統人士八日晚對記者稱：孫科院長辭職，李代總統挽留不獲，始予接受。其繼任人選，正由李代總統慎重考慮中，最早亦須至本月十一日始能提出，因立院下次會期爲十一日，屆時卽可徵求同意，惟以時局關係，繼任人選之決定，亦不致過於久延。以免影響政務，尤其影響和談之進行。該人士暗示，關于繼任人選，代總統早與有關人士分別計議，惟在正式提出之前，尚須徵求各方意見，俾此新行政院長能孚衆望。該人士鄭重宣示，新內閣必爲一「和平內閣」，自院長至各部會首長，均將爲能致力和平政策之人士，俾能協助李代總統，完成謀取和平之任務。爲實行政治革新，緊縮機構，行政院各部門之縮減栽併，卽將乘此政院改組時機，一併實行。部會數目，至少縮減三分之一，各部會首長，亦必甚多有變動。惟舊閣中施政具有成績，且不與和平政策相悖者，仍可蟬聯，俾資熟手。關于新閣中是否邀民靑兩黨參加問題，該人士稱：政府仍將邀請兩黨參加。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕李代總統八日午於孫科院長在立院宣佈其辭職後，卽電何應欽滬寓，邀請卽日返京。惟聞何氏已於晨間由滬赴杭，故電話未及接聽。李代總統當另電周　主席，請代覓訪何氏，希望能於晚間通電話，何氏此次赴滬轉杭，係爲避壽，（按本月十二日爲何氏壽辰）實亦避嫌。據權威方面今晚透露，季代總統確屬意何應欽氏出任行政院長，正向何氏徵求同意中。據稱，在一個月之前，李代總統卽有此意，曾非正式向何氏作此表示，當時何氏謙辭。現孫科旣已辭職，故李代總統決先正式徵求何氏之意見。惟李代總統仍需何氏在軍政軍令方面之協助，何氏如肯組閣，屆時可能以院長兼國防部長，而另以有力之副院長協助何氏，處理日常政務。何氏對李代總統之邀請，是否同意，現尚無所悉。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕何應欽將軍昨晨八時偕夫人離滬赴杭，隨行者有參謀劉某。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州八日電〕何應欽於今午十二時卅分由滬抵杭，浙主席周　親往迎駕，何氏偕夫人下榻裏西湖湯司令公館，聞此行爲避壽。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕據悉：黃紹竑氏可能出任新行政院之副院長。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕李代總統於孫閣辭職提出後，除已邀請何應欽氏出組新閣外，對於閣員亦已澦爲物色，適和談代表章士釗在京，會徵求章氏可否參加新閣，聞章氏巳允考慮。據可靠方面消息，章氏將任新閣之司法行政部長。</p>
<h3 id="c2">張治中王寵惠等亦爲可能繼任者 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕孫科內閣辭職照准後，其繼任人選爲誰，顯爲各方所最關心之問題。然在李代總統考慮決定，並正式咨請立法院同意以前，其人選不致發表。八日此間所傳繼任行政院長之可能人選，有下列諸氏，其中以何應欽氏之呼聲爲最高。</p>
<p>（一）何應欽氏爲一致公認最適合之人選，何氏現在上海，據聞渠曾於行前向人表示，設李代總統擬請渠組閣，渠亦將堅辭。其最大顧慮，爲過去曾直接指揮對共軍事行動，雖然當時由於政府政策之不同，但觀感方面，似不甚妥，尤恐中共方面引爲攻擊口實，致影響和談。且渠已應允李代總統，協助其在軍事方面之革新，包括員額之縮編，以及指揮方面之聯繫等項工作。設出任行政院長，卽難專心於此。</p>
<p>（二）張治中氏自蘭州應邀來京時，卽有部份人士揣想張氏將於孫科辭職後出而組閣，惟渠本人對此否認。一般認爲張如於此際出組新閣，可充分表示政府全力謀取和平之決心。張雖曾受中共廣播之攻擊，但其口吻遠較其他攻擊爲溫和，張氏現尚滯留某地，或卽與此事有關。</p>
<p>（三）部份政界人士，認爲現任司法院長之王寵惠，可能在李代總統之考慮中，而輔以何應欽之副院長，因目前京穗之間異見尚未盡消，邀請粵籍元老出組新閣，可能盡調協作用，而以何氏任副揆，代王氏主持日常公務，且何氏亦可兼任國防部長，處理軍政上之問題。惟王氏年事已高，值此時局艱難之日，是否願任閣揆，正成問題。</p>
<p>（四）據聞閻錫山亦爲考慮之對象，此項揣測大抵係由於山西籍立委武和軒倒孫最力所引起，然成爲事實之可能性極少。</p>
<p>（五）張羣尚滯京，渠一賞爲蔣總統考慮行政院長人選之主要對象，李代總統對張羣亦極器重，惟張氏於行憲後兩次閣潮中，均堅辭不就，此次恐亦未必肯重作馮婦。</p>
<p>（六）顧孟餘日前應李代總統電邀來京，旋怱怱返滬，現孫科辭職，若干人士以爲若由顧氏組閣，可一新國內國際耳目。然顧氏近年無意宦途，卽教長亦不肯應允，況此員整個行政責任之院長。</p>
<p>（七）此外亦有人傳言係邵力子氏，邵氏負責與中共之和談，殆成旣定事實，其任務並不亞於行政院長，而邵氏勢不能以行政院長身份飛平談和，故部氏之出組新閣，殆不可能。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕孫內閣總辭職書，已由八日下午政務會議通過，並由各政委分別簽名，於下午八時三刻，由孫院長親赴傳厚崗官邸，面呈李代總統，並請李代總統早日決定新閣繼任人選。孫氏在傳厚崗官邸，歷時數十分鐘，始行辭出。八日政務會議係下午四時在總統府舉行，孫院長及在京閣員均出席，會中並決定在新閣人選未決定前，仍繼續負責，直至新閣成立爲止。以後並將視事實需要，隨時再舉行政務會議，惟九日之政院例會，則將停開。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕孫科內閣總辭，曾經數次醞釀與波折。孫氏正式向李代總統表示辭職，係在六日下午，當日午後李代總統曾親赴政院一號官舍，往訪孫氏，是時孫氏正在午睡，李代總統未加驚動，卽留刺而去。孫氏醒來，獲悉李代總統曾親來訪，當卽驅車前往傳厚崗官邸晋謁，並請示代總統有何指示。與李代總統略談片刻後，孫氏卽向李代總統表示有辭職之意，並請物色新閣人選。李代總統當卽吿以曾邀何敬之先生組閣，惟何謙辭不就，故仍盼孫氏繼續負責。七日上午孫氏卽召集政院談話會，商討總辭及出席立院報吿施政方針問題。會中雖咸主相忍爲國，但對於總辭問題，意見并不一致。此時孫氏除已獲知李代總統之意向外，並接得可靠報吿，各立委對於渠之反對，巳屬無可挽回，經考慮後，卽於晚六時許，與吳副院長前往傳厚崗官邸，晋鍋李代總統，再度請辭。李代總統初仍表示何敬之不肯出任，請繼績負責，商談良久，臨行時，孫氏謂明日出席立法院報吿施政時，可否同時報吿辭職事，已獲代總統同意。李代總統當稱：「可以可以」：孫氏辭出後，其辭職遂吿確定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕孫科內閣辭職照准，今晨已由孫科在立法院中正式宣佈，執政僅兩個半月之孫內閣，終因各方抨擊甚烈不得不提出辭呈·孫科之被任爲行政院長係蔣總統於去年十一月二五日，向立法院提名，當日並經立院同意者。其組閣期問極長，堅十二月二十日，孫氏始宣布其內閣已吿組成。二十三日孫氏就職，同時舉行第一次政務會議。今年一月二十一日蔣總統引退當晚，孫氏曾向李代總統請辭，李代總統勉以繼續執行政務。其後因軍事形勢突擊，行政院決定暹穗辦公，南遷時之倉促，致造成若干幸事件，貽攻擊孫閣者以口寶，益以外傳府院之爭，及立院復會等問題，不滿之聲四起。及至二月二十八日，孫氏由穗趕返南京從事活動，亦已無及。</p>
<h3 id="c3">政府和談代表　鐘天心辭職　章士釗昨夜離京返滬 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕政府和談代表鐘天心，於八日內閣總辭後，爲表示連帶負責起見，巳正式向孫院長請辭和談代表，經孫院長核准，政府一月廿二日所派定之和談五代表，除彭昭賢早已辭職照准外，黃紹竑，鐘天心亦先後請辭，現和談代表已僅餘邵力子，張治中二人。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京八日電〕據可靠方面消息，張治中將軍在溪口蔣總統處作長期停留，以作爲蔣總統與李代總統間之非正式聯絡人。張氏爲政府和談代表，渠是否將暫回南京，以參加諒將於三月中旬召開和談，尚不可知。消息錯誤人士以爲張治中赴溪口只住數日，並認爲渠「延期」歸來表示有錯發生，此間謠言稱張已被「拘留」，純乃無稽。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕白崇禧，顧祝同八日晚七時聯合宴請章士釗，程潛。章氏來京，與程潛交換時局意見，在京停留三日，已於八日夜車返滬。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕行政院長孫科八日晨出席立院，於宣布其辭職照准後·補作就職後之施政報吿，歷一小時始畢。因孫已辭職，其報吿後之質詢，經立委「豁免」。孫氏報告時，政院各首長吳鐵城·徐永昌·洪蘭友·吳尚鷹·鍾天心·劉維熾·孫越崎·徐堪·龐松舟·陳雪屏·關吉玉等均列席。孫氏之報吿與日前對新聞記者之談話相同，惟透露三事：（一）縮軍問題，李代總統已請何應欽將軍組織軍事革新委員會，負責研究，俾將全部軍事人員數額由四百廿萬減至三百萬人（二）財政金融改革案實施後，政府每年全部收入，可望達九千萬美元，照政府全年支出，需六億美元。故全部收入不數兩個月之開支，非實行緊縮不可。（三）政府革新政治，決裁併駢枝機關，政院本身有十八個單位，擬裁減三分之一，各省市府亦然，省府機構過大，將來應恢復四廳一處制度，以節政費。孫氏報告時，首述和平問題，渠強調去年奉命組閣，並未經其本人同意，組閣之初，卽以執行和平政策爲已任，蔣總統元旦文吿中提出五項原則，渠主張不提出，但未被蔣總統採納，李代總統現事後，政院曾先後通過先停職，卽商談，及派定和談代表。及至李代總統所邀上海人民和平代表團赴平歸來，和談始相當樂觀，中共表示願於三月十五日後商談，政府已派十人研究起草政府方面之和談方案，最近數日，因十人中數人離京，故未開會。關於政府遷往廣州問題，孫氏亦有所解釋，謂政府遷移，在翁院長時代卽決定，並開始準備三月廿日政府南遷，係在李代總統指導下，會商三次始行決定者，當時因軍事情勢變化，原定守江北之七個軍，減爲留三個軍，而軍事負責人亦催政府於三日內遷移完畢，故於一月廿六日通知各國使節遷穗，但南遷時過於倉卒，若干首長先機關而行，致造成不幸事件，本人殊表遺憾。關於改革政治，孫氏指出數項要點：（一）減輕人民負担，軍費支出過高，部隊現已縮減至四百廿萬人，將來希望減至三百萬人。征兵制度弊端百出，擬改爲募兵制。軍方認爲遽然改制，易生流幣，應慎重考慮，唯征兵方法必須改善，同時兼行募兵制。（二）關於征糧，雖擬廢除，一時尚難實現，最近財金改革案規定自本年起停止征借，至征實是否能予廢止，財政當局正考慮中。（三）關於幣值問題，去年改幣，因者慮未周而失敗。目前治本之策，當爲和平裁軍，減低軍費支出；治標之策，卽爲財金改革案准許金銀自由流通買賣，惟外幣仍不得流通使用。出　　口力求增加，入口仍予限制，海關改收關元，貨物稅部份微實，均所以增加政府收入，保障稅值，惟全年收入九千萬美元，全年支出需六億美元，所收不敷二月開支，故政府仍須力事緊縮。（四）關於保障人民自由者，特刑庭已撤銷，因而連帶之數種法規如特刑庭組織條例，特刑庭審查條例，及危害國家緊急治罪法等，均經政院通過廢止，各地政治犯亦決議釋放。（五）關於提高行政效率，公務員待遇已決定自三月份起，按照當月當地生活指數調整，每月發薪兩次，以維生活。中央及地方機構均將簡化，駢枝機關應裁減。此外，關於調整中央與地方職機及財源問題，以及地方自治問題，均應照憲法中之規定實施。孫氏最後並稱，本人出長政院僅二月有半，施政無甚成續，現已提出辭職，經李代總統核准，渠希望新行政院長提名後，能獲立院一致支持，俾新行政院能迅速成立。</p>
<h3 id="c4">孫院宣布辭職照准　渡過立法院質詢難關 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕孫科宣布辭職照准後，立法院中反孫之激昂空氣乃吿消弭，八日晨爲立院舉行第三會期第三次會議之期，各委員咸重視孫氏之施政報吿，然多數委員尚不知孫已辭職，故對反孫事仍紛紛議論，會塲門前亦散發致孫科及上李代總統之油印函稿，要求同意者簽名，俾促成孫科之辭職，旋孫氏辭職照准之消息由某數委員傳出，各委員復繼續分別研商對策。開會後，孫科率政院各首長入塲，坐於主席台之右側，童院長宣布請孫院長作施政報吿時，會衆曾報以零落掌聲，孫氏係於報吿施政前宣布其辭職照准，據稱：「本人昨日與吳副院長向李代總統請示結果，已獲李代總統許可，故向貴院提出報吿，本院已向李代總統辭職，並經同意，李代總統現正微求繼任人選。」與會各委員聞訊，幾全體較掌，孫氏面不改色，仍從容作其應於就職時提出，而現則成爲辭職時提出之施政報吿，歷一小時始畢，主席宣吿休息。是時，若干委員決定如孫僅係口頭請辭，質詢仍應繼續進行，如孫氏提出書面辭呈，質詢手續卽可免除。續會後，李峰首先發言，渠稱：孫院長此次辭職，係體諒國家困難及人民希望，故仍爲「光榮的辭職」，惟此際發生一項問題，卽是否應就其施政報吿提出質詢，渠建議如孫院長在九日午十二時以前提出書面辭呈，卽不必進行質詢，如屆時仍未提出書面辭呈，質詢應於九日下午繼續進行。黃宇人·江一平等主張，孫院長旣當衆宣布辭職，當然照辦，故質詢應予停止，俾可節省時間。會塲中雖有人尚主張不論孫院長是否辭職，仍當照常質詢者，但經主席徵詢會衆是否可以停止質詢時，無人表示異議，孫科應付質詢之重大難關，竟以辭職一舉，而輕易渡過。孫氏旋卽率政院各首長退席，臨行前，孫氏並脫帽向會衆頷首爲禮，然後從容出塲，會塲中遂繼續討論議案，一陣行將到來之暴風雨，如此收塲，殊出會衆意料之外。至開會前散發之上李代總統函，亦以事過境遷，由秘書長陳克文代表各委員宣布收回，並請新聞記者勿予發表。</p>

<h3 id="c8">社論　玩弄政潮吿一段落　孫內閣總辭職以後將如何？ <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>行政院長孫科昨晨出席立法院報吿施政方針，首即正式宣佈內閣總辭職已獲李代總統批准，在新閣未產生之前，當仍照常辦公，以待交接。至於新閣人選問題，則在李代總統與在京樣要研究中，據各方傳稱，可能在張治中·何應欽·邵力子·顧孟餘·吳鐵城諸氏中擇定一人。在此和戰未定局勢日趨嚴重的今日，行政院長突然更迭，姑無論是否引起政潮的餘波，但至少必影響若干行政措施的推進。過去的我們不願有所詞費，但國民黨如果還像一個黨，政府還像一個政府的話，則在孫內閣總辭職以後，總得儘快着鞭，力贖前愆。因此，我們一本旁觀者淸的立塲，對今後政局，向顯貴要人貢獻幾句也許逆耳的話。</p>
<p>第一，孫院長奉命組閣之初，全國上下也無不希望他組織一僩新內閣出來，用新人行新政，一新天下的耳目。可是二個半月以來，舉棋不定，徬徨無主，喊出了「光榮的和平，」撲了一鼻子的灰，而政院遷穗，雖得李代總統的同意，又因行色倉皇，受盡了冷嘲熱諷，加以若干閣僚的行爲大受指摘，革新政治更根本談不到。於是政客朋比，流言四起，儼然似有府院之爭，迫使孫內閣不得不引咎辭職。觀於孫內閣總辭職的經過，即可知大難臨前，政府內部尙未能精誠團結。現在立法院倒閣的目的既巳達到，李代總統吏可乾綱獨斷，提出其　認爲可以輔弼之人選，而立法院對於今後新閣的產生，自更應盡極大的努力，促其早日誕生，使行政院眞能成爲一個責任內閣。須知在此嚴重期間，固不可一日無內閣，尤不可一日無責任內閣。假使行政院長及其所組織的內閣，依然是一個中心無主，唯唯從命的內閣，而事事有勞於國家元首的裁斷，則試問政策如果錯誤，設施如果失敗，究竟內閣負責呢，還是代總統負責呢？從前，在蔣總統未引退前，往往有人以爲總統管的事情太多，今後李代總統是否能改變這一種作風呢？府院之間，如果不從建立一個資任內閣的制度方面着眼，將來會不會因政策或職權之爭而再鬧意見呢？</p>
<p>第二，新內閣的施政方針，應該實事求是，千萬不可好高鶩遠，橋到後來，再使人民失望！在目前的情勢之下，人民對於今後新內閣的期望，並不過奢，一言以蔽之，「團結，革新，謀和」六個字，即可包括一切。團結就是力量，不團結不僅不能再戰，而且也不能獲致平等的全面的和平·革新是舉國一致的要求，人民在腐敗政治下呻吟巳久，不革新政治，人民的痛苦就無法减輕，禍國殃民的貪官汚吏，固須一網打盡，不能再任令混跡其間；就機苛擾人民的庶政，也應該立即停止。至於謀和，一方面固要顯示出政府具有謀和的誠意，但另一方面也要首先站住脚跟，確有謀和的力量。否則黨同伐異，爾詐我虞，自己先分崩離析，還那裏能够立於平等地位與中共進行和談呢？還不是說投降來得乾脆！和平的道路，任重而道遠，但儘管它曲曲折折，崎嶇不平，潛伏着許多困難，只要政府能革新振作，收拾人心，一定可以有力量獲致和平的。</p>
<p>第三，立法院在京復會而後，若干立委，也許爲了表不他們本人的「前進」起見，發表了許多光怪陸離的議論，其中尤以主張停止接受新實援與勸蔣總統出國二事，最爲荒唐！關於新美援，賴樸翰氏也已一再聲明，此非軍事援助性質，完全是一種救濟中國苦難人民的經濟援助；而且此項二億四千萬美元援華的建議能否獲得美國國會通過，尙未可知，乃代表中國人民的若千立法委員却先有反對的表示，這話從何說起？目前在戶口米繼續辦理的情形之下，食米的零售價格尙且迫近三萬大關，如若配米一旦停辦，米價的狂跳，更屬不可避免。乃素以人民代表自居者竟不能替升斗小民的生活想想，而專門高談其和平誠意，一若接受了經合署的美援，就是「主戰」，天下怪事，英過於此。中國人民是否需要美援，立委們可以回到諸公的選舉區舉行一個民意測騐，就不難明白民意的歸趨了。至於勸蔣總統出國一事，我們知道在若干外國記奢信口雌黃，挑撥離間的報道背後，原有一批政客在策動，以爲必如此而後快於心。平心而論，蔣總統的用人施政，容有不少缺點，但二十年來，領導革命，打倒軍閥，完成統一而後，又復領導抗戰，擊敗暴日，獲得最後勝利，功在國家，就是政敵也不當否認的。何况他爲减輕人民痛苦，翻然變計，主張弭戰謀和，身先引退，以示其誠，息影家園，徜徉山水，這種大政始家忘懷得失的風度，何等令人感佩。而且年來他受盡譏刺，從未置辯，忍辱緘默，已非常人所能及，乃此若干立委以及導演之徒，一若必欲迫其出國而後可以釋其心頭之重負，此誠伺苦來哉！蔣總統果伺負於國，而幷息影家園做一個公民而不許乎？或有人以爲蔣總統在溪口，仍發號司令，干涉軍政大計，阻撓和談，此種論調，更屬可笑。蔣總統如無謀和誠意，伺必引退？假令引退而後，尙不能檡人之疑，則出國而後，惟有前往蘇聯，始可以讓中共放心。否則天涯地角，不論蔣總統在那裏，中共都可以宣傳說他企圖捲土重來。立委諸公眞太爲中共說話而不替人民說公道話了。爲什麼？我們人民是公道的，有正義感的，送秋波的「前進」份子太過火了吧！</p>

<h3 id="c71">參會公用小組會議　各參議員發言熱烈　反對關元計算價格　應請中央恢復貼補 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日參議會公用小組委員會，召開會議，討論公用事業以關元結價時，各參議員先後發言者，有徐學禹·張中原·張志韓·江浩然·瞿鉞·李文杰·周祥生·何成甫·陳培德·朱扶九·虞舜等十一人。茲將吳市長，潘議長，趙局長，央行代表陳延祚，及各參議員之致詞分別錄后：</p>
<p>趙局長：公用局對於公用事業之責任，在督促各公司維持業務與提高效率，至於因幣制貶値而發生之影響，非市府或公用局所能爲力。爲求公用事業之得以繼續維持，必須使其有再生產之能力，亦卽須使公司收益在可能範圍中不受幣制眨値之影響，否則必致陷於停頓。各公用事業公司經濟方面，過去全恃中央銀行大量借款渡過，央行以貸款數額日趨流大，力有不逮，故一再表示除非公用事業能自身覓取自給自足之價格，否則以後不再貸款，市府於萬不得已中，爲求以後公用事業之能繼續服務，不得不變更計價辦法，俾求平衡。在擬議採用公用事業計價單位制之初，究以何種價値爲標準，市府初無定見，嗣因中央公佈財金改革新方案，乃擬以關元之〇·六二五爲計價標準，實則此單位卽等於「八一九」時之金圓券一元之幣値。</p>
<p>如有更好辦法無不樂於接受</p>
<p>現在煤觔及燃料油價，每天均依結匯證行市，隨時變動，欲使公用事業得以再生產，卽不得不認其成本有每日上漲之事實。且生活指數與外匯上漲率極爲接近，公用事業實行單位制後，對於工商界尙不致無力負担，因商品早已隨幣制貶値率隨時漲價。對工人及按職工指數計薪者，可向公司提前預付，亦不致吃虧。所不能負担者爲公敎人員，但現經政院通過，自三月份起，改按生活指數發薪，故亦可無問題。惟市府仍儘量設法使一般市民負担减低，故決定大戶預付，可免幣値跌落，普通用戶折合率放寬七天。又公共交通價格之調整，決保持機動性，此次新制實行時，原擬折合率超越百分之二十上下時，票價得增减之，但當行後，觀察乘客數量，最初兩日似見降落，前昨兩日已逐漸恢復，但爲市民便利計，折合率雖越百分之二十，市府仍通知各公司暫緩更動。對上項辦法，參議會如能在顧全市民負担及維持公用事業雙方兼顧下，提供卓見，市府無不樂於接受，攷慮改進或改正。</p>
<p>市長承認文字用錯　不應採取關元兩字</p>
<p>吳市長：每當公用事業調整價格時，總須麻煩諸位，實覺抱數。對於公用事業本身，市府絕未加以偏護，所以要加以維護者，乃在於維護市民之生命綫，因水電乃人生之必需品。上海之水電價格，若與全國各地比較，實是最低廉者固然加價足以加重市民負祖，但如一且水電中斷，則痛苦必更甚。欲維持公用事業，只有二條路可循：一是請求中央補貼，否則卽須自給自足。過去公用事業向由中央補貼，後新經濟方案公佈，明文規定今後停止貼補，而央行負責人亦因公用事業歷次貸款數額過鉅，無法負祖，曾請徐副議長轉吿趙局長可將公用事業價格提高，俾求平衡。本人明知新制實行後必將挨駡，然又不得不如此決定。今天本人所應該認鉛的，是將文字措詞用錯了，不應運用關元兩字，致負上破壞金融之罪名，事實上單位制原是以「八一九」金圓一元作爲基數的，而嚴格說來，公用事業上漲倍數仍較一般物價爲低，如以「八一九」爲基期來統計，物價上漲倍數，棉紗一二五〇倍，紙一三〇〇倍，油一七八五倍，米一二二五倍，麵粉一四二〇倍，而公用事業僅爲九八〇借。故參議會如認爲公用事業漲價太高，而能有更妥善之辦法，使一面能减低人民負担，一面又能繼續維護公用事業，市府願衷心接受，求其改進</p>
<p>貼補公用事業央行始終努力</p>
<p>中央銀行代表陳延祚：對於公用事業價格採單位制度一點，央行當時並未表示反對，或可以說亦卽等於贊同。公用事業價格總須求其公允，勉予抑低當非善策。過去央行對貼補公用事業一點，始終勉力以赴，僅二月份中，總計前後貸款達十億元左右，後因種種困難，不得不予以終止。此在央行已盡其最大努力，况對於貸款方面，全權操之中央，央行實無權決定。</p>
<p>議長發表意見希望中央貸款</p>
<p>潘議長：公用事業價格上漲，不應責怪市府，公用局，或是中央銀行，因爲他們都無能爲力。鈔票並不是央行願意發的。總之戰火一天不停，卽無法節流。今天我們是在沒有辦法中，求其解決。現在問題癆結在於：（一）基數問題——可由小組會加以研究，（二）倍數問題——如以生活指數爲標準，則應每半片調整一次，而目前困難在於第一期指數發表後，及第二期指數發表前期間之差額應如何彌補問題。本人認爲應請中央予以帮助，顧念上海人民實已無力負担，請中央借貸公用事業購買燃料等半個月之成本，俾求公司之維持。</p>
<p>如以關元計價必然造成錯覺</p>
<p>徐學禹：公用事業以關元計價絕對不妥，本人建議應以生活指數爲標準，先審定合理基價。爲彌補上下期指數間之脫節現象，可限定付款期限，過期須照下期指數付款。如生活指數與結匯證上漲相差過鉅時，可酌量調整其基數。張中原：建議（一）請市府卽日廢止公用事業以關元結算，以利幣信而維民生。（二）請監委調查主管當局是否與公司方面有勾結現象。張志韓：以關元計價必造成錯覺，金圓劵等於有名無實。</p>
<p>既然珍惜貼補為何發行大鈔</p>
<p>江浩然：主張定一基數，以生活指數爲調整標凖。瞿鉞：主張恢復貼補政策，除非央行今天宣佈，從此不再發行新鈔，否則公用事業之虧損應由央行設法解決。李文杰：（一）應該譴責的是中央的政策，爲什麼大鈔不斷印發，而單是珍惜貼公用事業這些小數目?（二）公用事業價格應以生活指數爲調整標準，其間差額應由央行發貨款。周祥生：政府應顧及人民之負担，貨款應予繼續。</p>
<p>過去押款那裏去了</p>
<p>何成甫：（一）根據公用局統計，發電一度，卽須用煤一公斤，公用局爲何不設法節電，卽可省煤。（二）公用事業公司不能維持時，可由市民預付，絕不應該以關元計價。朱扶九：據統計戰前本市每度電價折合美金一分餘，而今日已達五分餘，成本漲達四倍何故？故公用事業本身業務，應予檢討。虞舜：過去市民繳付之電燈押款，及保證金等往那裏去了，應予調查。</p>

<p>— 本報記者劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽一日訊〕今日的貴州，處在鄰省自由放任的夾縫中，度着她艱難困苦的歲月。當局雖有孤臣孽子的決心，以不變應萬變的態度，企岡拖過這中原板蕩的時局，可是短視的人民，眼見得別省的人民，有吃有暍，任意行事，只要目前有利可圖，那管它將來有何後果，何况野心家們隨處煽惑號召，無知鄉愚，當然容易揭竿而起，蠢蠢思動，這表現在最近貴州西南各縣一帶的匪患猖獗，最爲顯著，眞足使一向以安定著稱的貴州當局者爲之頭痛心煩。</p>
<p>貴州西南各縣</p>
<p>與廣西田西。西隆·樂業·天莪，雲南羅平·師宗·平彝·霑益各縣鄰封，這黔·桂·滇三省邊區的匪患，可以說自有民國以來，就迄未肅淸過一次。那一帶土司橫行，官吏貪汚，人民求生不得，惟有走上「梁山」，雖是打家刦舍，尙少殺人放火，這種盜匪，充其量不過使閭閻騷擾，地方不靖而已。這年來，自從共產份子如朱家璧·何正平，率領西南聯大具有野心思想的學生參加滇黔桂三省邊區的匪運之後，他們表面同情貧弱的人民，暗中勾結土司劣紳及地方上的一切惡勢力，慢慢的把政治思想，政治主張，灌輸進那些過去只知道打家刦舍的匪首腦筋裏，力量一天一天的成長，野心便一天一天的加大，演變到今天，可以說這三省邊區早已成了盜匪橫行的世界。</p>
<p>貴州西南各縣，屬第三行政督察區興仁專署所管轄，鄰近的興義縣舊名「黃草壩」，以產烟土見稱鄰省。</p>
<p>這是盜匪之源</p>
<p>最近如興仁。興義·册亨·望謨·盤縣·普安·晴隆·關嶺等縣，遍地匪氛，行旅裹足，甚至昆筑國道交通梗阻，郵電時通時停，造成政府控制縣城，盜匪控制鄉村的不幸局面，都是由於鴉片烟而起。一句話歸總，別省都在種，貴州偏要剷，人民定要種，政府偏要剷，野心家便號召徒衆，以武裝保護人民種烟來裹脅鄕愚稱兵作亂，影響所及，匪患愈來愈大所以目前的貴陽，竟有人以「充裕省財政」爲藉口，公開主張「貴州應該迅卽開禁，准許人民種烟」來替那一帶的烟匪解脫，並且說還可以因此而使地方秩序反復安定。這是題外之話，不過順便一提。</p>
<p>目前貴州西南各縣的匪情，仍以</p>
<p>盤縣最為嚴重</p>
<p>記者前次報導滇·黔·川三省邊區治安近貌的時候，說過盤縣糯寨土司匪首龍騰霄部雖是老巢被省縣團隊攻佔，他本人率殘部潰竄滇東平彝縣境，但是否會乘機捲土重來，仍大成問題。這機會果然不負龍匪，他率領殘部在平彝縣境休養生息之後，重與錢巴亮·陳雲飛·丁嶽松等匪首取得聯繫，於本月中旬回竄老巢，並向盤縣·普安間的土魯壩進攻，雖爲數只有二百多人，但已經震動了普安·晴隆各隣近縣份，好在省縣團隊賣力，才把這股匪壓迫回盤縣南區去了。但距興仁專署六十里地的普安縣境靑山一帶，最近忽然發現盤縣南區竄進來的股匪有一千多人，武器精良，攻勢頗銳，這股匪要是得勢，它可以攻佔興仁興義，轉而接應册亨望謨，整個南北盤江流域各縣都將大受影響，幸經省縣團隊在專員兼西南區各縣淸剿副指揮官盧傑的督攻之下，激戰了一週之久，計斃匪二百餘人，俘匪一百餘人，繳獲三十多枝槍，匪衆又回竄盤縣老巢整補去了。龍騰霄爲什麼會死灰復燃勢愈坐大呢，一來是縣長新舊交接，部署懈弛，一來是祖任淸剿的省保安一團團長魏煥藻在老廠地方按兵不動者幾達一月之久，致使匪衆得以慢慢休養整補，所以省府檢討結果，便先將魏氏調部查辦，另派江仲卿接充，電行淸剿。再者，當地的匪勢，旣已微有政治性質，徒用軍事絕不能奏效，最近對於丁嶽松，已在進行招撫，對於陳雲飛，錢巴亮已在採取分化政策，打算把他們隔離開來，實行分別聚殲，如果龍騰霄一旦勢孤力分，盤縣仍可能得到暫時安定。</p>
<p>兩省邊界鄉鎭</p>
<p>就從來沒有過淸靜日子，最近盛傳興義縣境已有四五個鄕鎭受召宗匪徒竄擾，居民日夕不安。至黔佳邊界紅水河北岸的册亨望謨兩縣，經常受着桂北·樂業·田西·西隆等縣的股匪騷擾，不特隨時竄據鄕鎭，就是册亨望謨的縣城，也是時處威脅之中，册亨縣城目前僅駐有一個省保安團的連部，前不久有西隆股匪圍攻縣城，幸賴駐軍頻險固守，援軍由四鄕團隊開到，圍城的股匪才退回西隆老巢。望謨縣城由縣府的常備民衛分隊担任警備，分隊長是夷人，竟於農曆元宵深夜率部叛變，圍攻縣長寢室，好在縣長沙盈璜是軍人，善於躱閃，卒於倉惶間逃出，率領身邊衛隊與武裝警察將叛衆擊潰，但已飽受驚恐了。</p>

<p>〔本報杭州六日訊〕一月十七日廣州行政院會議決定改任周暑爲浙江省主席後，作爲陳儀底得力幹部的任顯羣，得到這個消息，立刻向陳主席辭去了杭州市長和物資運用委員會主任委員的職務。</p>
<p>任顯羣歡送會</p>
<p>被「二二八」事變拌了交的陳公洽先生，當他再起於浙江的時候，他是抱着滿腔的熱情與希望到故鄉來爲父老服務，準備好幹一番事業的。（他曾費了八個月的時間，訂定浙江經濟建設十年計劃一事），而任顯羣則是抱着同樣的精神來到杭州，成爲陳氏理想的一個忠實的實行者。因此，任氏主杭，雖祗短短的八十天，而它的印象却深刻地烙印在杭州的五十萬市民底腦海中。當任氏隨陳主席離杭之日，杭州市民以熱烈的情緒和他送行。這種情緒表現在杭州最大的電影院太平洋戲院中舉行的歡送會上。歡送大會由浙江大學師範學院院長鄭曉滄先生主席，他對兩氏的匆匆離職，表示了無限的去思。大會的主席台上，掛滿了各式光輝耀眼的錦旗，各區的人民代表都來獻旗，而且有一位市民自願要求說話，結果他說：「政府喊着革命建國喊了卅多年，祗有陳主席和任市長才眞實踐了革命建國的行動，才眞是爲大多數人謀福利的長官。」記者所見過的各種「送官會」，從無有這種自發的高昂情緒的</p>

<p>任氏離職後，杭市的外勤記者們，爲表示去思，竟破例請官吃飯，結果因宴會多，而改在早晨吃麵。窮記者肯如此破鈔宴官，這是因爲做公僕的熟誠和精神眞正打動了他們的心。幾天以後，記者在西湖博物院前偶然聽見二個初中學生在聊天，從物價談到貪官汚吏之可惡。記者問他們任市長可是貪官汚吏？他們異口同聲地說：「任市長是個好官」。記者進而問他任市長好在那裏？他們的回答很快：「任市長替我們老百姓做事，所以是好官」。另一個還加上一句：「他能够和土豪劣紳作對，他不算好官嗎」？記者從他們底校徽上得知他們並不是市立中學的學生。任氏已經走了，當然也不會來收買十三四歲的中學生去作個人宣傳。記者於此，更深悉：「深得民心」，眞是做官的莫大榮耀。</p>
<p>八十天獲民心</p>
<p>任顯羣主政杭州市，祗短短的八十天，他是從那裏去深得民心的呢？主要的便是那位學生所說的，能「替我們老百姓做事」，也就是杭州東南日報所說的：「就是他爲着大多數貧困苦難的市民在工作」。任氏在此基本原則下，首先從整頓市財政，保障公敎人員生活着手，進而從社會秩序，都市衛生等等推展建設工作，他一面向市參議會提備忘錄，開出三個月完成八項建設的信用支票，一面依據杭市地理環境和市民的需要，進行現代都市建設的設計工作，順應輿論界的建議，以建立文化城爲今後工作之目標。他這樣從大處着眼，而從小處下手，順從民意，不願做「西湖市長，」而做眞正的杭州市長，切切實實地爲大多數小民努力，便是任氏所標榜的責任政治底成功處。雖然有人非議任氏，其辦事太重於宣傳，而行之過火。所謂「過火，」卽是看不順眼。其實，今日中國政治之搞到失去民心的地步時，最緊要的是政治效力，祗要他的目標是爲人民的利益，亦不足病。記者以爲病者，倒是怪任氏不應因上級之進退而隨便放棄自己未完成的工作。當然，這不僅是任氏之責，而牽連到中國政治上的贅癌，整個人事問題了。</p>
<p>兪濟民兼市長</p>
<p>任氏去職後，省府令秘書長徐雄飛代理。一度曾傳宣鐵吾將長杭市，此外又聞回任老市長周企虞將來重作馮婦，而結果，在三月三日周主席主持的首次省府會議中，通過發表省委俞濟民兼任杭州市長。俞濟民氏是浙江奉化人，是俞濟時的兄弟，畢業於北京高等警官學校，曾任浙江省會警察局督察長，寗波警察局長，鄞縣縣長，第六區行政督察專員兼區保安司令，山東省府委員，兼魯東行署主任。當陳公洽主浙時，俞氏調回浙江，担任省府委員。</p>
<p>具魄力重民意</p>
<p>任命令發表後，俞氏先返故里一行，定於十一日辦理交接，正式視事。行前略談施政謂一切均本周主席指示首先安定社會秩序，再分別緩急，進行建設。據俞氏謙稱：因曾力辭此職，經周主席數請，才勉受新命，所以施政綱領也還未考慮到。俞氏不僅出身警校，從事於警政行政工作，經騐頗久，且亦一度服務杭州警政，所以以俞氏之才，來安定杭市的社會秩序，各界無不認爲游刃有餘，對於建設工作，俞氏之做事魄力猶過於前任，而眼見任氏在杭之深得民心，想亦必順從民意，而爲多數小市民努力，不致偏錯了做公僕的目標。俞氏未接事前，已有市民公開建議，請新任市畏解決本市房荒，整修市民區街巷，以及從事西湖造林養魚。這也可以說是一般人的願望。</p>
<p>大目標堅定心</p>
<p>記者以爲値得一提的，乃是前任猶未完成的「現代都市建設的設計」工作。前任順從市參會和輿論界的建議，確立杭州應建爲文化城之意旨，聘請名學者浙大校長竺可楨先生主持都市計劃委員會，進行研究計劃的工作。這是一個遠大的眼光，不論環境如何變化，市府財力物力如何薄弱，記者以爲爲杭州着想，爲浙江着想，爲中國着想，今後杭市的主政者都應該朝着這個大目標，以堅定信心，能走一步便是一步，能做一件事，便做一件事。這不僅能得杭州市民之心，也是爲國人造福。</p>
<p>春天又臨西子湖畔，周主席在湖畔明媚的春光下舉行的記者招待會中，表示將澈底安定杭市的社會秩序，以吸引遊客，來繁榮杭州。但杭州市豈僅能單靠湖光山色，「三冬靠一春」的來繁榮？如果要讓杭州能「四季皆春」的來繁榮，那就必須充實內涵，把它建立爲文化城。杭州五十萬市民正期待着這樣的繁榮。</p>

<p>囤貨不如放息　乃有高利奇策　雖可拍案叫絕　火藥愈埋愈多</p>
<p>前些時，都說物價高漲，是利息高漲所致。</p>
<p>這幾天，物價呆鈍，又都說是利息高漲所致。</p>
<p>過去的說法，沒有錯。因爲利息加到物價去，變做成本的一部份。那末水漲船高，物價自是漲得更大了。</p>
<p>現在的說法，也沒有錯。因爲利息太貴，背了利息囤貨，不一定賺得出。那末與其背風險囤貨，還不如放高利，收現息的好。</p>
<p>然而利息和物價，同樣都受供需法則支配的。需要錢的多，利息自漲。爲什麽需要錢呢？自是爲了購物。那末需要錢多的時候，也就是需要貨的時候。所以利息漲時，物價也必漲。</p>
<p>同樣的，現在因爲大家認爲放價收息比囤貨上算。這就是需要物的人少，因而需要錢的人也少。物價於是平疲了。</p>
<p>正因爲物價平痰，大家都以爲囤貨不如放息了，於是大家都想放債，銀根供給就增加了。銀根供給多，利息自應看小，於是購貨容易，物價也就易漲；從而錢和物的需要都增加，利息和物價也就都上昇。</p>
<p>現在因爲利息高，大家都放高利去。大家都放高利，物價平疲，已是奇事；利息不小，更是奇事。這種變熊形態，實由金融當局的神奇看法和神奇手法造成的。</p>
<p>據說：目前金融當局，抱着一種想法。讓利息漲過物價。把游資引到放債上去。大家放債去，囤貨者自鮮，物價也就平疲了。</p>
<p>又據說：上週六，央行就根據這種看法，曾暗中叫人向本市各商業行莊，及地下錢莊去，儘量照黑市利息，扒借頭寸。關在央行裏，密使白貼利息。</p>
<p>據說：央行白貼掉的利息，反比拋實貨的價格損失來得少，而且反正只要印些發發就好了。</p>
<p>這種想法，眞可謂非非之想；這種手法，也可以拍案叫絕了。但前企危機，却因此而吏大。因爲：</p>
<p>（一）借了要還，現在借的又什九是短拆。還時銀根驟鬆；影響自大，此所謂收得放不得也。</p>
<p>（二）高利高，必因有人要。沒有人要，就漲不起來。現在由當局把利息硬抬得高高；那末物價一漲，必加倍追加上去。因此可以預料到的：今後一般物價，漲不到利息當做跌。漲出利息當做賺時，一漲卽非漲一倍二倍不可。平時旣爲利息關係，少少漲還當步步跌。漲時再來一二倍，那種情勢嚴重，那時的工資問題，都可以不言而喻。</p>
<p>（三）還有更可怕的事：投機市塲，本來都是進二步退一步的。現在日拆至少五角以上。每日一轉樓利，七八天就是一倍。所以今後投機性價格，平時以呆爲跌，風潮來時，則非一漲三四倍退一二倍不可。如此大漲大跌，暴富者果可不談，但暴破者必特多，因而牽一髮動全身之情勢，實不忍卒想了。</p>
<p>當局肯動腦筋，吾人實在偑服。但爲什麼專從飲鴆止喝方面轉念頭呢？如此做法，只有加重危機，斷無鬆弛可能。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會前見報載財政部財金改革方案內甲第六條關於貨物稅中棉紗等生產就廠征稅者，征收實物一節，當經該會常務理事會商討，一致表示反對，並已分呈行政院財政部請求免予實施。其所持理由約如下列：（一）金圖發行辦法第一條，中華民國之貨幣，以金圓爲本位幣，並公布自公佈之日起，公私會計之處理，一律以金圓爲單位今時僅半載，幣値日貶，財金改革，首宜建立幣信，以謀財政收支之平衡，與改善人民之生活。乃對從價征稅之貨物稅，改征實物，不啻昭示人民輕幣電物，其流弊所及，影響人民對金圓之信甩甚大。（二）田賦征實，積弊重重，已屬得不償失。今政府毅然停止，方示與民更始，轉忽於此時變更稅法，對貨物稅改征實物，此項措施，似墮國信，在政府但求增益稅收，而忽視生產事業之生存，似與政府扶掖工業之初旨，大相違悖。（三）各業各項支出，皆以金圓爲記帳單位，貨物稅自應依法以金圓繳納，不應有所更張。（四）至貨物稅改征實物，如謂旨在掌握物資，控制市塲，以收縮通貨，抑平物價，則已拌政府已一再拋售大量物資，未貝實效。茲就棉紗一項物資而言，所有代紡紗及美援紗，已由中央銀行掌握者，占總產量百分之七十以上，是政府已足以發揮控制市塲抑平物價之力量，固不必喝澤而漁，將紡織業僅存之脆弱基礎，亦一併而摧毀之。並聞該公會分函市商會曁全國工業總會，主持力爭云</p>

<p>〔新加坡航訊〕馬來亞羽球隊，自客幾遠征歐陸以來，先後將美國隊與丹麥隊擊敗而震驚世界體壇。這不但是馬來亞之光榮，而且是我們華僑的光榮，因馬歐之八位健兒，與領隊林泉玉氏，均係淸一色的華人，與其說代表馬來亞，勿寗說是代表中國更爲恰當。現在，馬來亞羽球隊不負衆望，先後以狂風掃葉之姿勞，淘汰美丹兩隊，將價値一千七百金鎊之金質湯姆斯盃携回馬來亞，爲此，本坡近日各熱心人士，正預備籌辦一隆重之儀式，以歡迎馬隊之榮旋。</p>
<p>日前自勝利之消息從倫敦傳來以後，單是由本坡發出之賀電，不下百封，其中包括坡督與輔政司等，還有馬來聯邦內地的不計在內。但是，許多熱心人士，認爲這還不够表演慶賀之熱忱，他們認爲應儘速捐款帮助該隊之經費，因爲該隊至今仍不敷助幣萬元左右；另外，尙需籌款捐建一座室內羽球塲，以作下屆（一九五二年）湯姆斯杯賽之用；而且本坡羽球協會副主席曾志成氏，日昨對記者發表談話稱：渠不已將召集各人士開會，討論如何舉行一盛大之凱旋遊行，以歡迎馬隊之榮歸，且派出樂隊往碼頭或飛機塲迎接代表馬來亞奪得世界羽球團體冠軍之健兒。</p>
<p>立法議員約翰黎覺則提議：由星馬二地政府發起舉行一個盛大之歡迎會，黎氏謂此藉藉無聞之馬來亞，不單以膠錫馳名於世，且將以羽球之出色而揚名於歐美也。黎氏復謂：余個人願捐出一千元以爲籌備歡宴馬來亞羽球榮旋之用，並希望政府早日公佈一有系統之計劃，向各界籌款，迅速建立一個現代化之羽球塲。</p>
<p>許多人現時正大惑不解者，乃馬來亞（包括星洲）擁有如此優秀之羽球人材，爲何迄今仍未有適合之羽球塲地設備？倘三年後世界各國羽球健兒，蒞臨爭奪下屆之湯姆斯杯時，將如何處置？因三年之期並不太遠，故應早日籌備。</p>

<p>— 蒼龍譯</p>
<p>但當我調派到海外各地時，又同樣的遭遇到這種傷感的事情。我跟一大隊拳擊手經過了阿留申羣島，非洲以達英國。一九四四年三月在英國撒立斯盤里地方，我想向一家民營的戯院買張票，那女賣票員表示抱歉，因爲那地區的美軍司令官員關照，祗准白種兵進戯院，黑種兵一槪禁止。後來這事傳聞於李約翰少將，李那時是艾森翟華將軍的副手。經過一次調查後，這地區定下這條規律的那位司令官，立刻被調遣回國。同時，遠征軍總司令部立卽頒佈命令說，設若有任何地方禁止美國兵前去，那末這禁例適用於全體美國的士兵，不單是指黑種士兵而言。</p>
<p>在海外的時候，我到過英國，蘇格蘭，非洲，意大利等地，當我還是底特律的一個可憐底孩子時，我根本沒想起能看到這些地方。</p>
<p>一九四三年，瑪芙在支加哥生了個女孩子，我們叫她傑瑰琳，現在已經五歲了。還有個男孩子叫小喬，他是一九四七年出生的，樣子看起來挺像我。</p>
<p>在我還沒有參軍以前，瑪芙就跟我談起退休的事。她說我已够名利雙收，在拳擊有史以來，我保持軍量級錦標的時候最長了，我又交了許許多多朋友。她說假使我長此戀棧，終有一天有人會把我打垮，我畢生奮鬥所得聲譽，也許就此會遭到毀損。我的經理人也這樣的對我說起，他要我同我的錦標頭銜同時退休。</p>
<p>我常時玩玩滾球運動，但大部份的時候，還是消耗在打高爾夫球上。</p>
<p>我想假使我不再從事拳擊，那末憑我現在所有的錢和財產，以及從表演賽中所得來的收入，我已可過得很好的日子了。我還有我的事業，例如喬路易企業公司，營業很鼎盛。喬路易飲料公司，在美國的三十一個城市裏和南美一帶，商品暢銷一時。我也是高級人壽保險會社的副總栽，我又組織了喬路易靑年俱樂部，做了這俱樂部的董事。</p>
<p>在支加哥的一個汽車行裏，我開設了一家支加哥汽車商業學校·我並不想靠這學校賺錢，任何人都可入學，但我還是喜歡給那些黑種學生念書，這些學生，出了校門，往往不容易像那些白種學生一樣的容易找到職業。我特別希望給像我的那些孩子一個機會，這些孩子該祗會靠了他們的雙手來工作。</p>
<p>我並不想繼續的從事拳擊，我曉得假使我拖下去，我遲早會遭受挫折的。任何人都該想到，他終有被吃　的一天。所以除了表演賽以外，如果我再跟人簽約對壘，那末這一戰一定是我拳擊生涯史上最後的一戰了（完）</p>

<p>— 戚公</p>
<p>去週市長盃足球準決賽，爆出了三年來最大的奇蹟，去屆盟主兼三年來之長勝軍靑白會竟被中航所淘汰，成績是二比一。</p>
<p>抱有問鼎市長盃雄心之鐵路隊以三比一之成績勝志起會獲得決賽權；該兩隊定在本週末舉行決賽，以定誰是新盟主；靑白之敗，鐵路無異去一勁敵，大可以高枕無憂，但中航是否往香港邀健將數員來滬助陣，在本週末便可分曉。</p>
<p>兩幕準決賽，爲着滬上足球水進低落，乏精彩演出，但戰情相當緊張，小將等特別賣力，從開賽到最後一分鐘都努力幹到底，中航除努力去拚外，固然是靠幾分球運來勝靑白；志超則沒有球運致被經驗較豐之鐵路隊所壓倒。茲將兩戰之過程評述如后。</p>
<p>「小敵不可縱，小將不可欺」</p>
<p>靑白之敗，犯上項之毛病，在上塲時對曾經最近屢戰艇敗之中航不放在眼裏的，精神未免有些鬆弛，更以狀態不佳，諸將心神渙散，攻勢雖盛，卒未能完成最後之一擊予中航以精神上之打擊，直至中航小將之球風一順，而中塲被中航所控制，靑白門前遂佈滿楚歌之音矣。</p>
<p>靑白之後防仍有穩健之演出，三毛爲全隊之冠；靑白之前鋒無攻堅之力，聯絡散漫，劉隆　非中鋒材，權充此職，行動遷綏，小顧好盤，充翼鋒而乏傳中之脚頭，體寅失態，祿生演出遠不及平日之水準，祗靠小羅孤軍力戰，又焉能獨鬥羣雄，先後雖曾追成十五次角球之機會，然沒有善於運用頭攻之鋒，直可謂錯過了十五次的良機，攻之不克，圍之不繼，前鋒之無能，眞出乎想像之外，遂陷守將於苦戰之中，中航僅得兩次最佳之良機，而能够把握着；高秀淸閃過笨重之孟義良，平地一槍與殷慶炳經三角念傳而暗渡陳倉，在將完塲之最後兩分鐘，決定了靑白之終身，粉碎了靑白雙料錦標之美夢。下半時靑白靠金祿生在極窄狹之角度下敲關，球從柱邊滑入網，成爲一比一，本有反和爲勝之希望，爲着仍取攻勢達數分鐘，但徐福生有穩健之演出和帶有球運，「球門深似海」加以諸守將負隅力拚，靑白諸鋒竟無問津之路；孟義良緊釘善跑之徐祖國，殷慶炳遂獲得避去電心而繞道從左邊繞入建功，避實擊虛，使黃仕傑無從措手。</p>
<p>中航之獲勝是全軍奮鬥得來，金川瀚鞠躬盡瘁，謝錫川在本季中表演最佳之一幕，陳效平人老路熟，有如識途老馬，到危險關頭，輒能把握着時機，寗將球踢出界外，亦不願靑白之鋒得有控球射門之機會，故個人奉送靑白七次角球之多。論功罪；苟靑白是藉角球之利而勝中航，則咎當在效平身上，然而靑白在角球機會中是屢攻不克，蓋因自瞿永福息影後，頭攻之技竟無能爲繼者，是亦做成效平因過獲功之因素，故效平之功罪是操諸靑白之手裏。總之：論實力，中航不及靑白，惜靑白未能保持狀態，而中航之戰憑勇與倖而已。</p>
<p>戰略得官，鐵路勝志超</p>
<p>以堅攻堅，是最不智之舉，鐵路應付志超，可謖於戰前曾熟加思慮，在比賽時是避實就虛，避開座鎭中路之吳祺祥，運用純熟之小「派司」來控制中塲，則電在兩翼之切入，在兵法上言是攻其所不易守之處，吳祺祥在中路，鞭長莫及，第一球之失，是由林典羲之誘出祺祥而傳中，張傑再撥，吳炳浩撥入，雖外兩翼齊飛，亦歸功於兩翼之能切入。鐵路本可有三比零之希望，因典羲操之過急，射中門桂，張傑有患得患失之心，頭頂一記，正送到盛彼得之懷抱裏，這是鐵路三軍用命，具有威脅之攻勢。第二球之失是祺祥之大意，自信渾身絕技，無人敢近，孰不料子文從旁竄出，力敲建功，志超直至失第二球止，祺群　防調任中鋒後，防衛方面才吿潰散，致有第三球之失，苟麒祥不出任前鋒，則志超最多不過失兩球，士氣並不因小敗而受影響，但祺祥遠出後，士氣不振及陣勢動搖，雖能扳回一球，然亦未能抵士氣之損失。</p>
<p>最令人注目者是吳祺祥與高保正兩人作佳妙的第三內衛演出，頭頂脚踢，在雙方之腹地內幾全見彼倆之足跡，扶危救險，居功最偉；鐵路則有純熟之聯絡，志超小將，以全力去拼，有卽到卽傳之脚頭，齊飛之兩翼，到達門前時，尙無最後一脚之功夫，右翼尙須祺脚法控球純熟，疾走傳中亦有佳作，江雷在供球在掠奪，俱見功夫，上半時，雖先失一球尙足能與鐵路相持，惟在下半時，拼力逆風作戰，浪費氣力，本擬一鼓作氣，再而三，三而竭，全軍氣力疲竭，遠不逮上半時之速度與英勇；兩震不能飛矣！內衛空防矣！力窮氣餒矣！這種種因素足以致志超於敗陣之地。</p>

<p>— 景欣</p>
<p>久別了十多年的袁大頭，這次重新露面，已經要刮目相看了。近日銀元露天市塲人頭擠擠，盛况空前。但物以稀爲貴，藏在民間的銀洋，畢竟爲數不少，故還够不上奇貨可居。目前袁大頭的受人靑睞，還只是因爲金圓券的不爭氣·一般銀元販子，也說不上能趾高氣揚。但美國有一個錢幣商人，叫梅爾的，確可算得上是世界錢幣阪子中的大王。</p>
<p>梅爾專門賣買稀見的錢幣。這種罕見錢幣，許多人像集郵，玩骨董一樣地收藏着，珍視着。梅爾從十六歲開始，五十年來，一直經營着這宗賣買。他常用通訊的方法來做交易，所以顧客分佈在各處，每年收到的信，總在廿萬封以上，最多的一年——一九三五年，曾收到一百廿五萬封談交易的信。因此，梅爾做的交易很大，價格也可以賣到最高峯。一九三三年，他做了一筆交易，共計廿二萬美金，是錢幣賣買中最大的數目了，那是代華爾圖·紐喀姆的收藏家買的。他曾將一枚一八〇四年的司帝乃銀幣賣到一萬零五百美元的高價，造成了銀幣價格中最高的紀錄。</p>
<p>梅爾做交易，有瞻量，有遠見。一九三五年，他曾出七十五元一枚的高價，徵求一九一三年發行的自由神頭像　幣，當時大家都嘲笑他。可是到了去年，每一枚自由神頭像的鎳幣，已値到三千七百五十元。原來許多己不流通的錢幣，政府常要把它們鎔掉，梅爾隨時注意這一類消息，來提高它的價値。他因爲看到財政部銷毀自由神頭像鎳幣的檔案，故而預先徵集，這是梅爾最得意的傑作。</p>
<p>梅爾得到一枚錢幣，都要追本求源地搜求它的歷史，發行的年代，鑄造的數量，有無特殊的意義，以及誰設計的岡案，誰雕的版，那個造幣廠造的等等。幾種極稀少的錢幣，他還得探知那幾個人曾收藏過。你去翻閱梅爾庋藏錢幣的簿册，在每一枚錢幣的旁邊，都有詳細的紀錄。這一類資料，是收藏家們極感到興趣的，因此也拉住了不少主顧。</p>
<p>在一般人想，錢幣的價値，總是越早越値錢。其實並不一定如此。梅爾說：「現今存在的最古錢幣，是紀元前三二三年，亞歷山大大帝時代的錢幣，但每枚</p>

<p>飯店中除了樂隊演奏和歌唱以外，沒有別的娛樂節目。大廳中有一塊舞池。四週座上常吿客滿，花樓上還有私人房間，最好的一間正對着樂隊。許多著名美國訪蘇人物，如霍布金，哈里曼，威爾基，納爾遜，羅斯福夫人等，都曾做過這裏的座上佳賓。</p>
<p>阿拉維的標準羅宋菜，第一道是酒，伏特加或高加索的高湼克，還有熱麵包和冷盤。接着是一道火鷄。再來就是正榮羊肉了，阿拉維的羊肉以香味聞名全俄。末一道是水菓，如果吃得下，還有冰洪淋。</p>
<p>這樣一頓飯要多少錢呢？連小帳等在內，約一百到一百七十五個盧布，視酒喝的多少而不同。這筆盧布，約合十八元到三十一元五角美金。</p>
<p>據蘇聯官方發表，蘇聯的工人平均工資，每月約爲七百盧布，所以吃這樣一頓羅宋大菜，也正不容易呢。</p>
<p>只値一元美金。而美國在一八七〇年造的三元金幣，每枚市價却在一千美元以上。在大戰時期，有一種羅馬小錢，在酋哥斯拉夫河兩岸絕跡，價格就漲到每枚美金十元。戰後，這種羅馬小錢又見面了，價格也跌下來，不到一元美金就可以買得一枚」。</p>
<p>去年，埃及國王想把他所收藏的錢幣賣去一部份。紐約，倫敦，巴黎的許多錢幣商人都去應徵，結果，却選中了梅爾。無疑地，梅爾在這宗難得的交易中，可賺進不少錢，並且還得到埃及國王的允許，把選中他的那封信，作爲廣吿刊出。這眞是所謂名利雙收了。</p>

<p>— 張洪祥</p>
<p>傘，俗稱洋傘，已是目前一件極普通的雨具。可是當牠出現的時候，却有過一段有趣而動人的故事。</p>
<p>英國女王維多利亞時代（十九世紀），在街頭上步行的紳士，可以說是沒有一個不拿一柄傘的。當時小說家司蒂文遜，曾說：「紳士們手不離傘，在他們心中，認爲這是一種體面的襟記。」雖然如此，「傘」這佩字，在莎士比亞時代（十六世紀），却還未曾創造。</p>
<p>遊歷家喬奈斯·海威，是英國（男人）拿傘的鼻祖。在他以前，沒有一個敢作此勇敢舉動。喬氏帶了傘在街上行走，倫敦的居民大起反感，說海威是道地女人腔，又說人民沒有理由避免上帝所賜的雨水。他們將水倒在他的頭上，將爛水果投擲他，譏笑地跟隨着。可是海威不顧一切，撑了他的一柄巨傘，自言自語地說：「不久將來，每一個人都會拿一柄的。」但是這句話沒有實現，三十年以後，傘並未普遍地應用。只有小飯館與咖啡室備有一二柄，是像汽車那樣出租給顧客的。這是一件很古怪的奇事，幾百年前，最乾燥的國家反比英國先知道怎樣應用傘。如緬甸地方，傘早己變得非常普通，不過白色的傘只留給帝王和神聖的白象。太古時候，東方都以傘作爲王權的象徵，從埃及與熟尼維的彫刻中，可以發現數千年前的時代，傘乃是極著名的。</p>

<p>讀近代史，知洪楊亂時農民最爲痛苦。自道光末年迄咸豐二十一年間，災禍頻仍，錢糧不免，而加徵課目繁多。旣定新糧，又追陳稅，保甲團練均按田畝多寡抽費抽丁。有田者雖貶價求售不得，甚而贈送亦無人接受。田間詩人沈石國有「詠田」一首云：昔日田爲「富」字足，，今日田爲「累」字頭。拖下脚來爲「甲」首，申出頭來不自「由」。田在心上「思」常苦，田在心中「慮」不休。當時只望田爲「福」，誰料田多「壘壘」愁！</p>
<p>此詩今日讀來，尤覺描寫逼眞而意味深長。蓋自勝利迄今，農民在兵荒馬亂之中，無不日坐愁城。一般自耕農，除了完糧納稅之外，又有「壯丁安家費」，「自衛特別捐」，「過境部隊招待費」，「鄉保公所辦公費」和「自治建設攤派」等等，五花八門，名目繁多，遠勝往昔·更有一般不食官吏，假公舞弊，新的土劣又復巧立名目，橫徵暴歛，平民痛苦之情形，較之當時，只有更甚一層，令人浩歎。</p>

<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>世界各民族間語言文字的歧異，是造成人類感情隔膜的主因之一。假如有一種世界語言，能够普遍的通用，對「四海一家」的運動，無疑的將多了一股推進力。遠在十七八世紀，大思想家如法國留卡兒，和德國里布尼茲等，都曾討論到這件事，听欠缺的，就是具體的表現。</p>
<p>在早期的世界語中，有德人許萊爾於一八七九年所發明以「烏拉普克」（Volapuk）。問世後十年間，在世界各地成立了二百八十三個烏拉普克推進會，以這種世界語翻譯了二十五種語文的書籍。可惜，再過兩年，烏拉普克竟由盛極而衰，漸趨消滅了。同時，在一八八七年，俄國柴門霍夫博士也發明一種世界語，叫做「阿斯潑蘭吐」（Esperanto）。問世後，各有關團體一致認爲是世界語的一大進步，德國大哲學家愛因斯坦和屈洛姆彼德贊助尤力。它最初流傳於俄國，後於一八九五年因它的機關報刊載了一篇托爾斯泰的文章而被封，傳播的工作遭受抑阻。但是，它並未就此夭折，却越過了沙皇的疆域，傳入西歐，在法國聲勢尤振，後來更越海而傳入英國。</p>
<p>一九〇五年，首屆世界語會議，在巴黎郊區舉行，卽席發表柴門霍夫的「宣言」，聲明世界語的用意與目的，也奠定了六十餘年來這種世界語流通的基礎。</p>
<p>同時，別種的世界語也先後問世。其中最早和影響最大的，是一九〇七年產生的「伊杜」（Ido。），它是根據阿斯潑蘭吐改編的。此外，還有好幾種，較不著名。</p>
<p>在一九二一和二二兩年中，國際聯盟曾經竭力推荐阿斯潑蘭吐爲正式的世界語，但因法國政府藉口學校敎授的問題加以反對，而未能通過。可是，世界語的傳播，並未因此沒落。相反的在一九三九年，就有四十二座電台用世界語廣播；同時，用世界語印行的書籍和小册子，也多達六千餘種。</p>
<p>一九二四年，「國際輔助語又協會」正式成立，這是世界語歷史上的一件大事。六年後，它在日內瓦組織了一個世界語的研究會，聚集各國名語言學家於一堂，檢討各種不同的世界語，希冀能够把它們統一起來，不要也像自然語文一樣的分歧。否則，非但學者無所適從，而且也失去了世界語的意義。不幸，經過長期的討論，這個會議對問題的實際解決很少有買獻。出席的專家們一般傾向於語言學上空洞的爭論，而未能專注於如何解決世界語的實用問題。</p>
<p>從壞的方面說，語文統一是侵略者毒辣的同化手段。但是，近百年來發動於民間的世界語運動，動機是純潔的。阿斯潑蘭吐的六十餘年的歷史，表示出極其有價値的榜樣，對促進國際間的瞭解，也有重大貢獻。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Resignation of the Cabinet Under Pressure; Successor Selection in Progress; Acting President Li Has Invited He Yingqin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Sources close to Acting President Li stated to reporters on the evening of the 8th: Premier Sun Ke's resignation was accepted after Acting President Li's attempts to persuade him to stay were unsuccessful. His successor is being carefully considered by Acting President Li and will not be proposed until the 11th of this month at the earliest, as the next session of the Legislative Yuan will be on the 11th, at which time consent can be sought. However, given the current situation, the decision on the successor will not be unduly delayed to avoid affecting government affairs, especially the progress of peace talks. The source indicated that Acting President Li had discussed the matter of the successor with relevant parties separately, but before formally proposing a candidate, he needs to solicit opinions from all sides so that the new Premier can meet public expectations. The source solemnly declared that the new cabinet will definitely be a "Peace Cabinet," from the Premier to the heads of all ministries and commissions, all will be individuals who can devote themselves to the peace policy, so as to assist Acting President Li in completing the task of seeking peace. In order to implement political reform and streamline institutions, the reduction and merger of various departments of the Executive Yuan will be implemented concurrently with this cabinet reshuffle. The number of ministries and commissions will be reduced by at least one-third, and there will be many changes in the heads of the ministries and commissions. However, those in the old cabinet who have performed well and whose policies are not contrary to the peace policy may remain in their positions to provide expertise. Regarding the question of whether to invite the Minqing (Democratic Socialist Party) and Qingnian (Youth Party) to participate in the new cabinet, the source said that the government will still invite both parties to participate.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] After Premier Sun Ke announced his resignation in the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 8th, Acting President Li immediately wired He Yingqin at his residence in Shanghai, inviting him to return to Nanjing immediately. However, it was heard that Mr. He had already left Shanghai for Hangzhou in the morning, so the phone call was not received. Acting President Li then wired Chairman Zhou, asking him to find Mr. He and hoping to speak to him by phone in the evening. Mr. He's trip to Shanghai and then Hangzhou was to avoid birthday celebrations (the 12th of this month is Mr. He's birthday) and also to avoid suspicion. Authoritative sources revealed this evening that Acting President Li indeed intends to appoint He Yingqin as Premier and is seeking Mr. He's consent. It is said that Acting President Li had this intention a month ago and had expressed it informally to Mr. He at that time, but Mr. He declined modestly. Now that Sun Ke has resigned, Acting President Li has decided to formally seek Mr. He's opinion first. However, Acting President Li still needs Mr. He's assistance in military affairs and military orders. If Mr. He is willing to form a cabinet, he may concurrently serve as Premier and Minister of National Defense, and another capable Deputy Premier will be appointed to assist Mr. He in handling daily government affairs. It is not yet known whether Mr. He will agree to Acting President Li's invitation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] General He Yingqin left Shanghai for Hangzhou with his wife at 8:00 AM yesterday, accompanied by a staff member surnamed Liu.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] He Yingqin arrived in Hangzhou from Shanghai at 12:30 PM this afternoon. Zhejiang Chairman Zhou personally greeted him. Mr. He and his wife stayed at Commander Tang's mansion on the Inner West Lake. It is said that this trip is to avoid birthday celebrations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] It is reported that Huang Shaohong may be appointed as Deputy Premier of the new Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] After Premier Sun's resignation was submitted, Acting President Li, in addition to inviting He Yingqin to form a new cabinet, has already been looking for cabinet members in advance. As peace talk representative Zhang Shizhao was in Nanjing, he was asked whether he would participate in the new cabinet. It is reported that Mr. Zhang has agreed to consider it. According to reliable sources, Mr. Zhang will serve as the Minister of Justice and Administration in the new cabinet.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Zhang Zhizhong, Wang Chonghui, and Others Are Also Possible Successors <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] After the Sun Ke cabinet's resignation was approved, the question of who will succeed him is obviously of greatest concern to all parties. However, the candidate will not be announced until Acting President Li considers and decides, and formally requests the consent of the Legislative Yuan. On the 8th, the possible candidates for Premier circulating here are the following, among whom He Yingqin has the highest support.</p>
<p>(1) He Yingqin is unanimously recognized as the most suitable candidate. Mr. He is currently in Shanghai. It is said that he once told people before his departure that if Acting President Li intends to invite him to form a cabinet, he will firmly decline. His greatest concern is that he directly commanded military operations against the Communist army in the past. Although it was due to different government policies at the time, the perception does not seem very appropriate. He is particularly afraid that the Chinese Communists will use it as an excuse to attack, which will affect the peace talks. Moreover, he has already promised Acting President Li to assist him in the reform of military affairs, including the reduction of personnel and the coordination of command. If he takes the post of Premier, it will be difficult for him to concentrate on this.</p>
<p>(2) Some people speculated that Zhang Zhizhong would come forward to form a cabinet after Sun Ke's resignation when Mr. Zhang was invited from Lanzhou to Nanjing. However, he himself denied this. It is generally believed that if Mr. Zhang forms a new cabinet at this time, it can fully demonstrate the government's determination to strive for peace. Although Mr. Zhang has been attacked by the Communist broadcast, his tone is much milder than other attacks. Mr. Zhang is still staying in a certain place, which may be related to this matter.</p>
<p>(3) Some political figures believe that Wang Chonghui, the current President of the Judicial Yuan, may be under Acting President Li's consideration, with He Yingqin as the Deputy Premier to assist him. Because the differences between Nanjing and Guangzhou have not been completely eliminated, inviting a senior member from Guangdong to form a new cabinet may play a coordinating role, with Mr. He as the Deputy Premier to preside over daily government affairs on behalf of Mr. Wang. Moreover, Mr. He can also concurrently serve as Minister of National Defense to handle military and political issues. However, Mr. Wang is old and whether he is willing to serve as Premier in these difficult times is questionable.</p>
<p>(4) It is rumored that Yan Xishan is also a consideration. This speculation is mostly caused by the Shanxi legislator Wu Hexuan's strong opposition to Sun, but the possibility of it becoming a reality is very small.</p>
<p>(5) Zhang Qun is still staying in Nanjing. He has always been the main target considered by President Chiang for the position of Premier. Acting President Li also attaches great importance to Zhang Qun. However, Mr. Zhang has firmly declined the premiership in the two cabinet crises after the implementation of the constitution, and he may not be willing to take on the job again this time.</p>
<p>(6) Gu Mengyu came to Nanjing at the invitation of Acting President Li a few days ago, and then hurried back to Shanghai. Now that Sun Ke has resigned, some people believe that if Mr. Gu forms a cabinet, it can refresh the domestic and international image. However, Mr. Gu has had no intention of pursuing an official career in recent years, and he would not even agree to be the Minister of Education, let alone the Premier who bears the entire administrative responsibility.</p>
<p>(7) In addition, some people have rumored that it is Shao Lizi. Mr. Shao is responsible for the peace talks with the Chinese Communists, which has almost become an established fact. His task is no less important than that of the Premier, and Mr. Shao cannot fly to Peiping for peace talks in the capacity of Premier. Therefore, it is almost impossible for Mr. Shao to form a new cabinet.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Sun cabinet's general resignation letter was passed by the political affairs meeting on the afternoon of the 8th, and was signed by the political commissioners separately. At 8:45 PM, Premier Sun personally went to the Chuanhougang official residence to present it to Acting President Li and asked Acting President Li to decide on the successor for the new cabinet as soon as possible. Mr. Sun stayed at the Chuanhougang official residence for several tens of minutes before leaving. The political affairs meeting on the 8th was held at the Presidential Palace at 4:00 PM. Premier Sun and the cabinet members in Nanjing attended. The meeting also decided that before the new cabinet members are decided, they will continue to be responsible until the new cabinet is established. In the future, political affairs meetings will be held at any time as needed. However, the regular meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 9th will be suspended.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The general resignation of the Sun Ke cabinet has been brewing and fluctuating several times. Mr. Sun formally expressed his resignation to Acting President Li on the afternoon of the 6th. That afternoon, Acting President Li personally went to Premier's official residence No. 1 to visit Mr. Sun. At that time, Mr. Sun was taking a nap. Acting President Li did not disturb him, but left a calling card and left. When Mr. Sun woke up and learned that Acting President Li had personally visited him, he immediately drove to the Chuanhougang official residence to pay his respects and asked Acting President Li for any instructions. After talking with Acting President Li for a while, Mr. Sun expressed his intention to resign to Acting President Li and asked him to look for new cabinet members. Acting President Li immediately told him that he had invited Mr. He Jingzhi to form a cabinet, but Mr. He declined modestly, so he still hoped that Mr. Sun would continue to be responsible. On the morning of the 7th, Mr. Sun convened a talk meeting of the Executive Yuan to discuss the general resignation and the issue of attending the Legislative Yuan to report on the policy direction. Although everyone advocated enduring for the sake of the country, opinions on the general resignation issue were not consistent. At this time, in addition to learning about Acting President Li's intention, Mr. Sun also received a reliable report that the opposition of the legislators to him was irreversible. After consideration, he went to the Chuanhougang official residence with Deputy Premier Wu at about 6:00 PM to visit Acting President Li and request his resignation again. Acting President Li initially stated that He Jingzhi was unwilling to take the position and asked him to continue to be responsible. After a long discussion, Mr. Sun said before leaving that when he attended the Legislative Yuan to report on the policy direction tomorrow, could he also report on his resignation? He obtained the consent of the Acting President. Acting President Li then said: "Yes, yes." After Mr. Sun resigned, his resignation was confirmed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Sun Ke cabinet's resignation was approved and formally announced by Sun Ke in the Legislative Yuan this morning. The Sun cabinet, which had been in power for only two and a half months, finally had to submit its resignation due to strong criticism from all sides. Sun Ke was appointed as the Premier by President Chiang on November 25 last year, and was approved by the Legislative Yuan on the same day. The period of his cabinet formation was extremely long. On December 20, Mr. Sun announced that his cabinet had been formed. On the 23rd, Mr. Sun took office and held the first political affairs meeting at the same time. On the evening of January 21 this year, when President Chiang retired, Mr. Sun resigned to Acting President Li. Acting President Li encouraged him to continue to perform his duties. Later, due to the sudden attack of the military situation, the Executive Yuan decided to move its office to Guangzhou. The haste of the move south caused some unfortunate events, which gave those who attacked the Sun cabinet ammunition. Coupled with the rumors of disputes between the Presidential Palace and the Executive Yuan, and the resumption of the Legislative Yuan, dissatisfaction arose. By February 28, Mr. Sun had rushed back to Nanjing from Guangzhou to carry out activities, but it was too late.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Government Peace Talk Representative Zhong Tianxin Resigns; Zhang Shizhao Left Nanjing Last Night and Returned to Shanghai <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Government peace talk representative Zhong Tianxin, in order to express joint responsibility after the general resignation of the cabinet on the 8th, formally resigned from the position of peace talk representative to Premier Sun. The resignation was approved by Premier Sun. Among the five peace talk representatives appointed by the government on January 22, except for Peng Zhaoxian, who had resigned and been approved earlier, Huang Shaohong and Zhong Tianxin also resigned successively. Currently, there are only two peace talk representatives left: Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] According to reliable sources, General Zhang Zhizhong will make a long-term stay at President Chiang's residence in Xikou to serve as an informal liaison between President Chiang and Acting President Li. As Mr. Zhang is a government peace talk representative, it is not yet known whether he will return to Nanjing temporarily to participate in the peace talks, which are expected to be held in mid-March. Sources mistakenly believed that Zhang Zhizhong went to Xikou for only a few days and believed that his "delayed" return indicated that something went wrong. Rumors here that Zhang has been "detained" are purely unfounded.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Bai Chongxi and Gu Zhutong jointly hosted a banquet for Zhang Shizhao and Cheng Qian at 7:00 PM on the 8th. Mr. Zhang came to Nanjing to exchange opinions on the current situation with Cheng Qian. After staying in Nanjing for three days, he returned to Shanghai by night train on the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Premier Sun Ke attended the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 8th. After announcing that his resignation had been approved, he gave a supplementary report on the administration since taking office, which lasted for one hour. Because Sun had resigned, the interpellation after his report was "waived" by the legislators. When Mr. Sun reported, the heads of the Executive Yuan, Wu Tiecheng, Xu Yongchang, Hong Lanyou, Wu Shangying, Zhong Tianxin, Liu Weichi, Sun Yueqi, Xu Kan, Pang Songzhou, Chen Xueping, and Guan Jiyu, were all present. Mr. Sun's report was the same as his previous conversation with reporters, but he revealed three things: (1) Regarding the issue of troop reduction, Acting President Li has invited General He Yingqin to organize a military reform committee to be responsible for research, so that the total number of military personnel can be reduced from 4.2 million to 3 million. (2) After the implementation of the financial and monetary reform plan, the government's total annual income is expected to reach 90 million US dollars, while the government's total annual expenditure is 600 million US dollars. Therefore, the total income is not enough for two months' expenditure, and retrenchment must be implemented. (3) The government is determined to reform politics and merge redundant institutions. The Executive Yuan itself has 18 units and plans to reduce one-third of them. The same is true for provincial and municipal governments. The provincial government agencies are too large and should restore the system of four departments and one office to save government expenses. When Mr. Sun reported, he first mentioned the peace issue. He emphasized that he was ordered to form a cabinet last year without his consent. At the beginning of the cabinet formation, he took the implementation of the peace policy as his own responsibility. He advocated not proposing the five principles proposed in President Chiang's New Year's message, but was not adopted by President Chiang. After Acting President Li took office, the Executive Yuan successively passed the resolutions to suspend duties first, then negotiate, and appoint peace talk representatives. When the Shanghai People's Peace Delegation invited by Acting President Li returned to Peiping, the peace talks were quite optimistic. The Chinese Communists indicated that they were willing to negotiate after March 15, and the government has sent ten people to study and draft the government's peace talk plan. In recent days, because several of the ten people have left Nanjing, the meeting has not been held. Regarding the government's move to Guangzhou, Mr. Sun also explained that the government's move was decided during Premier Weng's tenure and began to prepare. The government's move south on March 20 was decided under the guidance of Acting President Li after three consultations. At that time, due to the changes in the military situation, the original seven armies guarding Jiangbei were reduced to three, and the military person in charge also urged the government to complete the move within three days. Therefore, on January 26, the foreign envoys were notified to move to Guangzhou, but the move south was too hasty, and some heads of agencies went before the agencies, causing unfortunate events, for which I express my regret. Regarding the reform of politics, Mr. Sun pointed out several key points: (1) Reduce the burden on the people. Military expenditure is too high. The troops have now been reduced to 4.2 million, and it is hoped that they will be reduced to 3 million in the future. There are many abuses in the conscription system, and it is planned to change it to a voluntary military service system. The military believes that a sudden change of system can easily lead to abuse and should be carefully considered, but the conscription method must be improved, and a voluntary military service system should be implemented at the same time. (2) Regarding the collection of grain, although it is planned to abolish it, it is still difficult to achieve for a while. The recent financial and monetary reform plan stipulates that borrowing will be stopped from this year. Whether the collection of grain can be abolished is being considered by the financial authorities. (3) Regarding the issue of currency value, the currency reform last year failed due to insufficient consideration. The fundamental solution at present is peace, disarmament, and reduction of military expenditure. The palliative solution is to allow the free circulation and trading of gold and silver in the financial and monetary reform plan, but foreign currencies are still not allowed to circulate. Efforts should be made to increase exports and restrict imports. Customs duties should be collected in customs gold units, and some of the commodity taxes should be implemented to increase government revenue and protect tax value. However, the annual income is 90 million US dollars, and the annual expenditure is 600 million US dollars. The income is not enough for two months' expenditure, so the government must make every effort to tighten its belt. (4) Regarding the protection of people's freedom, the Special Criminal Tribunal has been abolished, and consequently, several related regulations such as the Special Criminal Tribunal Organization Regulations, the Special Criminal Tribunal Review Regulations, and the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Country have been abolished by the Executive Yuan, and political prisoners in various places have also been decided to be released. (5) Regarding improving administrative efficiency, the salaries of civil servants have been decided to be adjusted according to the local cost of living index in the current month starting from March, and salaries will be paid twice a month to maintain livelihood. Central and local agencies will be simplified, and redundant agencies should be reduced. In addition, issues such as adjusting the functions and powers and financial resources of the central and local governments, as well as local autonomy, should be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. Mr. Sun finally said that he has only been the Premier for two and a half months, and has not made much progress in administration. He has now submitted his resignation, which has been approved by Acting President Li. He hopes that the nomination of the new Premier will be unanimously supported by the Legislative Yuan, so that the new Executive Yuan can be established quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Premier Sun Announces Approval of His Resignation; Overcomes the Difficult Interpellation in the Legislative Yuan <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] After Sun Ke announced the approval of his resignation, the fierce atmosphere of anti-Sun in the Legislative Yuan was eliminated. The 8th morning was the date for the third meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan. The members attached importance to Mr. Sun's policy report, but most of the members did not know that Sun had resigned, so they still discussed the anti-Sun matter one after another. At the entrance of the venue, mimeographed drafts of letters to Sun Ke and Acting President Li were distributed, asking those who agreed to sign to promote Sun Ke's resignation. Then, the news of the approval of Mr. Sun's resignation was spread by some members, and the members continued to discuss countermeasures separately. After the meeting, Sun Ke led the heads of the Executive Yuan into the venue and sat on the right side of the podium. When President Tong announced that he would invite Premier Sun to make a policy report, the audience applauded sporadically. Mr. Sun announced the approval of his resignation before reporting on the policy. It is said: "Yesterday, the Deputy Premier Wu and I asked Acting President Li for instructions, and we have obtained the permission of Acting President Li, so I am submitting a report to your hospital. Our hospital has resigned to Acting President Li and has been agreed to. Acting President Li is now slightly seeking successors." All the members present burst into applause, Mr. Sun remained calm and calmly made his policy report, which should have been submitted when he took office, but now it has become a policy report submitted at the time of resignation, which lasted for one hour before the chairman announced a recess. At this time, some members decided that if Sun only verbally resigned, the interpellation should continue. If Mr. Sun submitted a written resignation, the interpellation procedure could be exempted. After the continuation meeting, Li Feng spoke first. He said that Premier Sun's resignation this time was out of consideration for the country's difficulties and the people's hope, so it was still a "glorious resignation." However, a question has arisen at this time, that is, whether to raise questions on his policy report. He suggested that if Premier Sun submitted a written resignation before 12:00 noon on the 9th, there would be no need to conduct the interpellation. If the written resignation was not submitted by then, the interpellation should continue on the afternoon of the 9th. Huang Yuren, Jiang Yi, and others advocated that since Premier Sun had announced his resignation in public, it should be followed up. Therefore, the interpellation should be stopped to save time. Although some people in the venue still advocated that whether Premier Sun resigned or not, the interpellation should be conducted as usual, when the chairman asked the audience whether the interpellation could be stopped, no one expressed any objection. Sun Ke's major difficulty in dealing with the interpellation was easily overcome by the move of resignation. Mr. Sun then led the heads of the Executive Yuan to leave the meeting. Before leaving, Mr. Sun took off his hat and nodded to the audience as a courtesy, and then calmly left the venue. The meeting then continued to discuss the bills. A storm that was about to come was ended in this way, which was unexpected by the audience. As for the letter to Acting President Li, which was distributed before the meeting, the Secretary-General Chen Kewen, on behalf of the members, announced that it would be withdrawn because things had passed, and asked reporters not to publish it.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Legislative Yuan held the third meeting of the third session on the morning of the 8th, and passed the proposal submitted by Li Feng and 103 others, requesting the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the heads of important ministries and commissions, and political commissioners to return to Nanjing to work. During the peace talks, the political affairs meeting should be quickly resumed in Nanjing to benefit the administration and promote peace. The case was discussed together with the Executive Yuan's official letter that the government decided to move to Guangzhou, the heads of various agencies should bring the necessary personnel as scheduled, and the remaining personnel should be evacuated separately before February 5, and the case of the relocation location of various agencies. There was almost no one who held a positive objection during the discussion, and it was quickly passed. Today's meeting was chaired by Tong Guanxian. The meeting was opened at 9:35 AM. After the secretariat read two reports, Premier Sun announced that his resignation had been approved, but he continued to give a policy report. Because the audience decided to stop the interpellation, there was time to pass Li Feng's proposal before noon. Another item for discussion was Huang Tong's proposal to quickly stop conscription and grain collection. Some advocated reservation, some advocated submission for review. During the vote, it was found that there were only 92 people present, which was less than the legal number. It was decided to leave it for the next meeting to handle, and the meeting was adjourned at 12:05 PM.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Changshu, 8th] Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Capital-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, in order to strengthen river defenses, arrived in Yu by car at 11 a.m. on the 8th to inspect. At the command post, he met with military and government leaders, listened to reports, and inquired in detail about river defenses. At 1 p.m., he inspected the garrison troops at Shimei Stadium and held a meeting at Dayi Bridge to give instructions. He left Yu at 3:30 p.m. According to what our reporter was told: the river defenses are extremely solid, and he was quite satisfied with this trip, with absolute peace and order assured. It is also learned that the river defense troops have been placed on high alert to ensure safety. A curfew has been imposed in the urban area starting at 11 p.m., and no one is allowed to pass without a night pass.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Suzhou, 8th] Tang Enbo arrived in Suzhou by special train from Shanghai at 10 a.m. on the 8th. After a short rest, he immediately went to Changshu by car to inspect the river defenses. In the afternoon, Tang's adjutant returned to Suzhou and notified that the special train had left Suzhou for Wuxi. It is said that Commander-in-Chief Tang went directly to Wuxi from Yu that day.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Wuxi, 8th] Tang Enbo arrived in Wuxi at 5 p.m. on the 8th. After getting off the train, he went to Sheqiao to inspect the Zhongqin School. On the 9th, he will go to Changshu to provide guidance at the First Pacification Zone's pacification meeting.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 8th] The area along the river in northern Jiangsu is still in a state of calm. Military sources say that the recent movements of the Communist troops can only be seen as a gesture. At most, it is only to complete the necessary preparations and deployments before crossing the river. At present, the defenses of the bridgeheads on the north bank of the Yangtze River under the control of the National Army are extremely solid. Therefore, the talk of "crossing the river" is premature, and there is still some time before the Communist troops' deployment is mature enough for them to attack the bridgeheads.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 8th] Military sources here on the 8th denied the following three things: (1) The Communist 11th and 12th Columns, with 30,000 men, are moving towards the Liangtai area, with talk of attacking the port of Qikang. (2) The loss of Sanjiangying at the port. (3) The vanguard of the Communist troops has reached the vicinity of Guazhou. According to official military intelligence, the Communist 11th and 12th Columns are still on both sides of the Hai (An) - Tai (Xian) line and near Ruhuang, with no signs of moving towards the port. Sanjiangying at the port is still under national control, and there has been no major contact in these two places recently. As for the situation facing Zhenjiang, the National and Communist armies have always been confronting each other on the Sanyou River-Shijiaqiao line, with no other changes. Guazhou is about 15 li south of Sanyou River.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 8th] The First Pacification Zone's pacification meeting is scheduled to be held in Changshu on the morning of the 9th. Chairman Ding and others went to Changshu on the evening of the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 8th] According to a telegram from Yizheng, at around 2 p.m. on the 8th, a small group of Communist troops launched a sneak attack on the north of Yizheng city. After the county security regiment stationed there counterattacked, they pursued the victory to Majiaji, destroyed the Communist Yizheng County Government in that area, and seized more than 40 shih of public grain. In this battle, the Communist troops suffered more than 50 casualties.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] According to unconfirmed reports: Li Mingyang, a supervisor who crossed the river to the north to consult with the leaders of the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu, has returned to Nanjing, bringing back Chen Yi's guarantee that the Communist troops will not launch a military operation to cross the river in the next two months. It is said that Mr. Li submitted a report to Acting President Li on the 7th.

<p>Sun Ke Giving a Policy Report in the Legislative Yuan (Central News Agency Photo)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Editorial: Political Maneuvering Comes to an End: What Will Happen After the Resignation of Sun's Cabinet? <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Premier Sun Ke attended the Legislative Yuan yesterday morning to report on his government's policies, first formally announcing that the resignation of his cabinet had been approved by Acting President Li. Before the new cabinet is formed, the current cabinet will continue to work as usual, pending handover. As for the selection of the new cabinet, it is under study by Acting President Li and key figures in Nanjing. According to various reports, one person may be selected from among Zhang Zhizhong, He Yingqin, Shao Lizi, Gu Mengyu, and Wu Tiecheng. At this time when the situation of war and peace is uncertain and becoming increasingly serious, the sudden change of premier will, regardless of whether it causes a political backlash, at least affect the promotion of some administrative measures. We do not wish to dwell on the past, but if the Kuomintang still acts like a party and the government still acts like a government, then after the resignation of Sun's cabinet, it must quickly spur itself on and make amends for its past mistakes. Therefore, from the standpoint of a clear-headed observer, we offer a few perhaps harsh words to the dignitaries regarding the future political situation.</p>
<p>First, when Premier Sun was ordered to form a cabinet, the whole country hoped that he would organize a brand new cabinet, use new people to implement new policies, and give the world a fresh start. However, in the past two and a half months, he has been indecisive and at a loss, shouting about "glorious peace" only to be met with disappointment. Although the relocation of the Executive Yuan to Guangzhou was approved by Acting President Li, it was rushed and subjected to cold ridicule. In addition, the behavior of some cabinet members was heavily criticized, making political reform fundamentally impossible. As a result, politicians colluded, rumors spread, and there seemed to be a dispute between the Executive Yuan and the Presidential Office, forcing Sun's cabinet to resign. From the process of Sun's cabinet's resignation, it can be seen that even when disaster is imminent, the government has not been able to unite sincerely. Now that the Legislative Yuan's goal of a vote of no confidence has been achieved, Acting President Li can act decisively and propose candidates he believes can assist him. The Legislative Yuan should also make every effort to promote the early birth of the new cabinet, so that the Executive Yuan can truly become a responsible cabinet. It must be understood that in this critical period, there must not be a day without a cabinet, and especially not a day without a responsible cabinet. If the Premier and his cabinet continue to be without a central figure and simply follow orders, and everything requires the judgment of the head of state, then who is responsible if policies are wrong or measures fail, the cabinet or the acting president? In the past, before President Chiang's resignation, some people thought that the president was in charge of too many things. Will Acting President Li be able to change this style? If the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Presidential Office does not focus on establishing a system of responsible cabinet, will there be disagreements again due to policy or power disputes in the future?</p>
<p>Second, the new cabinet's policy guidelines should be realistic and pragmatic, and should not be overly ambitious, only to disappoint the people later. Under the current circumstances, the people's expectations for the new cabinet are not extravagant. In a nutshell, the six words "unity, innovation, peace" can encompass everything. Unity is strength. Without unity, we cannot only fight again, but also achieve equal and comprehensive peace. Innovation is the unanimous demand of the country. The people have been groaning under corrupt politics for a long time. Without political innovation, the people's suffering cannot be alleviated. The corrupt officials who harm the country and the people must be eliminated once and for all, and must not be allowed to remain among them. The miscellaneous taxes that harass the people should also be stopped immediately. As for peace, on the one hand, the government must show sincerity in seeking peace, but on the other hand, it must first stand its ground and have the strength to seek peace. Otherwise, if it is partisan and deceitful, and collapses first, how can it stand on an equal footing with the CCP for peace talks? Wouldn't it be more straightforward to surrender! The road to peace is long and arduous, but despite its twists and turns, ruggedness, and lurking difficulties, as long as the government can reform and revitalize itself, win over the people, it will definitely have the strength to achieve peace.</p>
<p>Third, after the Legislative Yuan reconvened in Nanjing, some legislators, perhaps to express their own "progress," made many bizarre remarks, especially the proposals to stop accepting new US aid and persuade President Chiang to go abroad, which were the most absurd! Regarding the new US aid, Mr. Lapham has repeatedly stated that this is not military aid, but purely economic assistance to relieve the suffering of the Chinese people. Moreover, it is not yet known whether this proposal for US$240 million in aid to China will be approved by the US Congress, but some legislators who represent the Chinese people have already expressed their opposition. How can this be explained? At present, with the household rice program continuing to be implemented, the retail price of rice is already approaching 30,000. If the rationed rice is stopped, the soaring rice price will be inevitable. Yet those who claim to represent the people cannot think about the lives of ordinary people, but only talk about their sincerity for peace, as if accepting the US aid from ECA is "pro-war." Nothing could be stranger than this. Whether the Chinese people need US aid or not, legislators can return to their constituencies to conduct a public opinion poll, and it will not be difficult to understand the trend of public opinion. As for persuading President Chiang to go abroad, we know that behind the sensationalist and divisive reports of some foreign reporters, there is a group of politicians plotting to do so, thinking that they will only be happy if they do so. In all fairness, President Chiang's appointment of people and implementation of policies may have many shortcomings, but for twenty years, he has led the revolution, overthrown the warlords, completed unification, and then led the War of Resistance, defeated the brutal Japan, and achieved the final victory. His contributions to the country cannot be denied even by his political enemies. Moreover, in order to reduce the suffering of the people, he changed his plans and advocated for peace, first retired to show his sincerity, and retreated to his hometown to enjoy the mountains and rivers. Such a broad-mindedness of a statesman who forgets gains and losses is admirable. Moreover, he has been subjected to ridicule for years, but has never defended himself, enduring humiliation and remaining silent, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people. Yet some legislators and their directors seem to want to force him to go abroad before they can release the burden in their hearts. This is truly bitter! If President Chiang has failed the country, is he not allowed to retire to his hometown and be a citizen? Some people think that President Chiang is still issuing orders and interfering in military and political affairs in Xikou, hindering peace talks. Such arguments are even more ridiculous. If President Chiang had no sincerity for peace, why would he retire? If he still cannot dispel people's doubts after retiring, then he can only go to the Soviet Union to let the CCP feel at ease. Otherwise, no matter where President Chiang is, the CCP can propaganda that he is trying to make a comeback. The legislators are really speaking for the CCP too much and not speaking fairly for the people. Why? We the people are fair and have a sense of justice. The "progressive" elements who are currying favor are going too far!</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Changsha, 8th] The prices of goods in Changsha are comparable to those in Guangzhou due to the silver dollar pricing. However, the merchants are still not satisfied and conspire to demand that the government recognize that the silver dollar exchange rate can be increased or decreased at any time, and at the same time attempt to overturn the provincial bank's silver dollar exchange rate, making the black market for silver dollars legal. For this reason, the Garrison Command convened a financial meeting on the 8th and decided: (1) Negotiated prices are not allowed. (2) The silver dollar price is still set by the provincial bank. (3) Register and control all money houses.</p>
<h3 id="e16">After Taiwan Province Restricted Entry: Few Travelers Arrive in Taiwan; Eight People Detained for Having No Documents and Will Be Sent Back to Shanghai <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Taipei, 8th] Since the implementation of the Taiwan Province's restriction on entry measures, the Taiwan-Shanghai liners have only carried 13 passengers in the past week. Among them, eight people are detained in Keelung because they have no entry permits and are being prepared to be sent back to Shanghai. Only two passengers arrived on the Minzhong liner that arrived yesterday. It is said that air passengers are slightly favored, and those without documents can complete the procedures, but the number of passengers is also small.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] After Taiwan Province implemented the measures restricting the entry of passengers, yesterday, when the Zhongxing liner sailed from Shanghai to Keelung, the number of passengers was only 10% of the number of passenger tickets stipulated, with 35 in first class, 32 in second class, and 107 in fourth class, for a total of only 174 people. According to those familiar with the shipping industry, the income from passenger and cargo transportation on this trip of the Zhongxing liner is not even enough to purchase fuel. Under this situation, its business will inevitably decline like the Beiyang line. Therefore, the shipping industry is seeking to provide convenience to passengers and hopes that Taiwan Province will send personnel to Shanghai to review passengers entering Taiwan, in order to eliminate the trouble for passengers in Shanghai to apply to Taiwan in writing.</p>

According to diplomatic sources familiar with the content of the draft, the draft stipulates: (1) If any signatory country is attacked in Europe or North America, it should be considered an attack on all signatory countries. The attacked countries should immediately take various necessary actions, individually and collectively, to maintain security, including the use of force. As for whether to declare war, it will be handled at the discretion of each government. (2) The area to which this treaty applies generally refers to the Atlantic region north of the equator.

<h3 id="e31">US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Approves Second Year of Aid to Europe Fund, Totaling $5.58 Billion <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 8th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today passed the second year of Marshall Plan aid to Europe, totaling $5.58 billion. This case has passed the first major hurdle. The above-mentioned funds include $4.28 billion for the 1950 fiscal year and $1.15 billion for the period from April 3 to June 30, 1949. There is also $150 million for pre-signing contracts for goods to be shipped to Europe in the 1951 fiscal year.</p>
<p>According to Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally, it should be passed by the Senate, but the thirteen members who voted on this case reserved the right to review the total amount of funds again when the Appropriations Committee considers the appropriations. Vandenberg, an important figure in the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the members decided to oppose cutting funds now due to unstable prices. The Foreign Relations Committee has added two amendments to expand the powers of Hoffman, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, and another to allow Italians who are willing to move to Central and South America to use American ships, while still stipulating that 50% of the tonnage of American goods shipped overseas must be loaded by American ships as much as possible, and give sympathetic consideration to the American economy when purchasing goods. If all things are equal, the Economic Cooperation Administration should first consider purchasing American surplus goods. Hoffman's expanded powers are two: (1) to allow him to represent the Federal Supply Bureau and sign 20-year contracts with foreign countries to purchase strategic raw materials; (2) to stipulate a uniform water foot for goods shipped to Europe, which is paid by the Economic Cooperation Administration. According to Connally, the Senate will vote on this case as soon as possible, but after the Senate passes it, it must be passed by the House Foreign Relations Committee and the House of Representatives before it can be signed by the President, and then a funding plan can be proposed.</p>

At the same time, the US Senate's action can also resolve the differences among European recipient countries on the distribution of aid materials for 1949.</p>

(6) The countries receiving Marshall Plan aid should strengthen the coordination of export plans.

The Soviet Union, Byelorussia, and Poland voted against it, and India abstained. The US proposal implicitly refers to the inhumane treatment of millions of people in Soviet labor camps and should be investigated by the International Labor Bureau. The resolution calls on Secretary-General Lai to contact the governments of the accused countries in order to obtain their cooperation in conducting the investigation. The Soviet Union has made it clear in past debates that it will refuse the United Nations to investigate behind the Iron Curtain. The Soviet delegation said that this investigation is a plan for the United States to send special agents into the Soviet Union. There is no slavery in the Soviet Union, and slave labor only exists in capitalist countries. American workers are enslaved by the Taft-Hartley Labor Act. The Soviet Union itself proposed a case advocating the establishment of a large-scale labor committee, with one representative elected by every 100 million union members worldwide. If this committee requires an on-site investigation of the labor situation in the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will allow it. The Soviet proposal was rejected by a vote of fifteen to three, with the Soviet Union, Byelorussia, and Poland voting in favor.</p>

<p>[United Press, Cleveland, 8th] Republican foreign policy spokesman and US representative to the United Nations, Dulles, stated in a speech here on the 8th that "under the current circumstances," the Soviet Union does not plan to start a war with the West. Dulles further warned that if the United States sends a large amount of military aid to Scandinavia, it may trigger a war. If a large amount of military aid is supplied under the proposed Atlantic Treaty, the Soviet Union may "assume" that if it believes its territory is under "imminent and serious threat," it will wage war. Dulles continued, saying that war with the Soviet Union "is not inevitable." He warned anti-communist countries that war would only expand the area controlled by the Communist Party.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Rumor: Soviet Troops Enter Bulgarian Territory; Planning to Prevent Turkey and Yugoslavia from Participating in the Mediterranean Pact; Soviets Prepare Air Transport to Break Yugoslavia's Blockade of Albania <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 8th] Local newspapers reported today that fifteen new Soviet troop units have arrived in Bulgaria. It is said that this information was revealed by political exiles who recently fled Bulgaria to Turkey. It is also said that the Soviet Union is currently putting pressure on Yugoslavia and Turkey not to sign the Mediterranean Pact.</p>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, Germany, 7th] It is reported that the Soviet Union is preparing air transport to break Yugoslavia's blockade of Albania. A fleet of four-engine bombers will fly 450 miles from Skopje, over Yugoslav territory to Tirana, twice a week, carrying both passengers and cargo. Although this decision was made by the Skopje government, the aircraft and crew are dependent on the Soviet Union. The outstanding achievements of the US and British airlift in Berlin have seemed to move the Soviet Air Force to show its Cominform members that the Soviet Union can also overcome the blockade problem. Note that the Soviet Union does not have an air corridor in Yugoslavia, which is different in nature from that of the US and Britain in Berlin. It is difficult to predict the outcome if Soviet aircraft try to fly across forcibly, as Yugoslavia has been very attentive to its airspace boundaries in the past.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] The US House of Representatives today passed a bill authorizing the strengthening of the US espionage network abroad. The content of the bill was kept strictly secret when it was first introduced to the House a month ago, and now it has been sent to the Senate for discussion. The House Armed Services Committee submitted a report with the bill, stating that because most of the information in this case is highly confidential, this report cannot provide a detailed explanation of the various provisions of the bill. However, after review, the committee believes that the bill is quite satisfactory. US Labor Party Congressman Marcantonio strongly opposed the bill during the House debate, pointing out that it was the first time in American history that the House was being asked to vote on a bill without being able to request an explanation. The purpose of the bill is to give the Central Intelligence Agency, the center of US intelligence work in the world, permanent authority to carry out its mission. The Bureau is now subject to presidential orders and will no longer be required to publish its payroll and expenditure figures.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New Haven, Connecticut, 7th] Newly translated ancient Babylonian texts published here reveal that price controls existed at least 3,800 years ago in the Kingdom of Eshnunna during the Babylonian era.

After translating it, he found that there were price limits for grains, wool, oils, and wages at that time. The Kingdom of Eshnunna was on the east bank of the Tigris River, and its most prosperous period was from 2000 to 1800 BC.</p>

Chairman Wang Zhuyi first clarified the purpose of convening the subcommittee, which was to study whether it was reasonable to price public utilities in Customs Gold Units. The Municipal Council is entrusted by the people and should speak with a fair attitude from the people's standpoint. On the one hand, it must also adhere to the principle of maintaining public utilities in order to achieve a reasonable solution. Then, Director Zhao explained in detail the method of pricing public utilities in Customs Gold Units. Mayor Wu then reported on the decision-making process of this method, and Chen Yanzuo, the representative of the Central Bank, explained the difficulties of subsidies. Then, Speaker Pan and the councilors successively expressed their opinions, unanimously believing that the price of public utilities based on Customs Gold Units would increase the burden on citizens and stimulate price increases, expressing their opposition. The councilors spoke very enthusiastically at yesterday's meeting, especially expressing their anger that the government could not take into account the people's livelihood. The meeting adjourned at around 7 p.m. The following six resolutions were made: (1) Request the Municipal Government to cancel the pricing standard based on Customs Gold Units immediately. (2) After approving the base, multiply the base by the employee cost of living index announced by the Municipal Government every half month to determine the tariff. (3) Request the Central Government to pre-borrow funds from various public utility companies on a monthly basis for one month or at least half a month to maintain their business. (4) For foreign exchange required for purchasing equipment and fuel, request the Central Bank to approve pre-settlement for one month or at least half a month.

It will be sent to the Municipal Government Meeting for review and then to the Municipal Council for discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e61">College and University Students Apply for Public Funding <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Various Schools Are Starting to Investigate and Handle</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] The base of the food subsidy for publicly funded students in national colleges and universities in this city has been increased to ten yuan, and March will be issued at 500 times. As a result, the problem that follows is that most of the self-funded students in various schools are unable to pay for food and have requested full public funding. During the previous petition to Beijing by the presidents of various national colleges and universities, this issue was raised, and Acting Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education allowed each school to handle work-study students within the scope of 20% of the number of self-funded students, depending on the situation. The schools are now preparing for this matter, accepting applications and starting investigations.</p>
<p>Fudan President Zhang Yi told reporters that there are more than 7,000 self-funded students in the school, and more than 400 of them have applied for public funding. The school has formulated a method that, regardless of academic performance, applications can be made if the father is dead, the parents are unemployed, the parents are public servants, or the family is in the border area, or the remittance value has depreciated due to the low prices in the hometown.</p>
<p>Tongji University has more than 1,200 self-funded students. President Hou Jianbai said that most of them are from Sichuan, Guizhou and other places. Due to the large number of people requesting public funding, the school has specially changed the quota of 20% of work-study students (that is, full public funding) to 40% of half-funded students, so that more students can benefit. Applications have now begun, and decisions can be made after investigating academic performance and family circumstances.</p>
<p>There are more than 1,000 self-funded students at Jiaotong University, and most of them also request public funding. President Wang Zhizhuo said that the school can only handle it within the scope of 20% of the quota. If the application exceeds the limit, it will be transferred to the Ministry of Education for resolution.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of national college and university staff requesting further study fees, the presidents of the schools all expressed sympathy and will hold a meeting to exchange opinions within the week. However, the presidents of the schools believe that they can only request this matter on their behalf, and the final decision lies with the Ministry of Education.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] The air fundraising for scholarships organized by the Education Bureau has not achieved ideal results. The recognized donations totaled 14 million yuan. After the Boy Scouts went door-to-door to collect donations, in addition to receiving approximately 10 million yuan, the rest either did not recognize the donations, or the address and name did not match, and 4 million yuan could not be received. The Education Bureau received 10 million yuan and will issue it to various schools as soon as possible. The first batch can be issued tomorrow. Yesterday afternoon, the presidents of various universities in the city, including Liao Shicheng of Guanghua, Hu Dunfu of Datong, Hu Wenyao of Zhendan, and Wang Yukai of Guangxia Business College, visited Director Li of the Education Bureau to discuss the distribution of scholarships to various universities. They hope to issue them quickly and that the total statistics of the scholarship can be made. In addition to the 10 million yuan already received, the 10 million yuan donated by the Municipal Government can be received within a few days. The remaining donations of goods such as silver dollars and rice are worth approximately 5 million yuan. The presidents of the universities then called on Speaker Pan and Mayor Wu to turn to the Central Bank to negotiate and ask them to donate 15 million yuan in order to reach the standard of 40 million yuan in total. The presidents of the universities then left and visited Speaker Pan and Mayor Wu.

<p>Xu Xueyu, Chairman of the China Merchants Bureau, will fly from Shanghai to Tokyo within this month to negotiate with the Allied authorities on salvaging the Jiangya ship. If calculated at current prices, it would cost US$3 million to build a Jiangya-type ship, so the China Merchants Bureau will spare no expense to salvage it, and can also take this opportunity to investigate the cause of the ship's explosion to clarify the responsibility for the accident. It is estimated that the cost of salvaging the Jiangya ship is US$195,000, and the repair cost is approximately US$300,000.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Spring Business Tax to Be Levied Immediately: Calculated Based on the Average Spring Three-Month Price Index; Deadline for Payment Is Ten Days After Receipt of Payment Notice <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>In order to discuss how to levy this year's spring business tax in this city, the Municipal Finance Bureau specially invited relevant agencies such as the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Industrial Association, the Municipal Government, and the Social Bureau to the Shanghai Municipal Bank on Jiujiang Road yesterday (7th) to hold the fourth meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Business Tax Simplification Assessment Committee. After careful discussion, three methods were decided. After the meeting, the Finance Bureau has immediately calculated the tax according to the resolution and stipulated that each business must pay the tax within ten days after receiving the payment notice. The three methods are recorded below.</p>
<p>(A) The average of the total price index for the three months of spring in the 38th year will be used to calculate the amount of spring tax payable. Because the total price index for March has not yet been compiled and published, the total price index for February will be used as the index for March for averaging and calculation, which is equivalent to calculating and levying the amount of tax levied in the winter of the 37th year at 45 times the base. The minimum amount of business tax levied this spring shall not be less than 500 gold yuan.</p>
<p>(B) Businesses should still pay the spring business tax within ten days after receiving the payment notice. If it is overdue, it will be considered overdue. If it is overdue for more than ten days, it will be punished according to law. Businesses that are closed or newly opened in the spring should still report truthfully for tax assessment and determination.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Public Works Subcommittee Meeting: Councilors Speak Passionately Against Pricing in Customs Gold Units; Request Central Government to Restore Subsidies <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the Public Works Subcommittee of the City Council convened a meeting to discuss pricing public utilities in Customs Gold Units (關元). Councilors Xu Xueyu, Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhang Zhihan, Jiang Haoran, Qu Yue, Li Wenjie, Zhou Xiangsheng, He Chengfu, Chen Peide, Zhu Fuyu, and Yu Shun, a total of eleven, spoke successively. The speeches of Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Director Zhao, Central Bank representative Chen Yanzuo, and various councilors are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Director Zhao: The Public Works Bureau's responsibility for public utilities lies in urging each company to maintain operations and improve efficiency. As for the impact of currency devaluation, neither the municipal government nor the Public Works Bureau can do anything about it. To ensure the continued maintenance of public utilities, they must have the ability to regenerate, that is, to ensure that company revenue is not affected by currency devaluation within the possible range, otherwise, they will inevitably fall into stagnation. In the past, the economic aspects of various public utility companies depended entirely on large loans from the Central Bank to get through. The Central Bank said that the amount of loans was becoming increasingly large, and its strength was insufficient, so it repeatedly stated that unless public utilities could find a self-sufficient price, it would no longer lend money in the future. In desperation, the municipal government had to change the pricing method to achieve balance in order to continue providing public utility services in the future. At the beginning of the proposal to adopt the unit pricing system for public utilities, the municipal government initially had no fixed idea of what value to use as a standard. Later, when the Central Government announced a new financial reform plan, it proposed to use 0.625 of a Customs Gold Unit as the pricing standard, which is actually equivalent to the value of one Gold Yuan (金圓券) during the "August 19th" period.</p>
<p>Willing to Accept Better Methods</p>
<p>Currently, the price of coal and fuel oil changes every day according to the exchange settlement bank rate, and in order to enable public utilities to regenerate, it is necessary to recognize the fact that their costs are rising every day. Moreover, the cost of living index is very close to the foreign exchange rate increase. After the implementation of the unit system for public utilities, the industrial and commercial sectors should not be unable to bear it because the prices of commodities have already risen with the currency devaluation rate at any time. For workers and those paid according to the employee index, the company can pay in advance, so they will not suffer losses. Those who cannot bear it are public school teachers and staff, but now that the Executive Yuan has approved that from March, salaries will be paid according to the cost of living index, so there should be no problem. However, the municipal government is still trying its best to reduce the burden on the general public, so it decided that large households can avoid currency devaluation by paying in advance, and the conversion rate for ordinary users is relaxed for seven days. In addition, the adjustment of public transportation prices will be kept flexible. When the new system was implemented, the original proposal was that the fare could be increased or decreased when the conversion rate exceeded 20% up or down, but after implementation, the number of passengers seemed to decline in the first two days, and it has gradually recovered in the past two days. However, for the convenience of citizens, even if the conversion rate exceeds 20%, the municipal government still notified the companies to temporarily postpone the change. If the City Council can provide insightful opinions that take into account both the burden on citizens and the maintenance of public utilities, the municipal government will be happy to accept, consider, and improve or correct the above measures.</p>
<p>Mayor Admits Wrong Choice of Words; Should Not Have Used the Words "Customs Gold Unit"</p>
<p>Mayor Wu: Every time public utility prices are adjusted, we always have to trouble everyone, and I really feel apologetic. The municipal government has never favored public utilities themselves. The reason why we want to maintain them is to maintain the lifeline of the citizens, because water and electricity are necessities of life. If Shanghai's water and electricity prices are compared with those in other parts of the country, they are indeed the lowest. Of course, raising prices will increase the burden on citizens, but if water and electricity are cut off, the suffering will be even greater. There are only two ways to maintain public utilities: one is to request subsidies from the central government, otherwise, they must be self-sufficient. In the past, public utilities were subsidized by the central government. Later, a new economic plan was announced, which explicitly stipulated that subsidies would be stopped in the future. The person in charge of the Central Bank also stated that the amount of loans for public utilities had been too large in the past and could not be supported. He asked Deputy Speaker Xu to tell Director Zhao that the prices of public utilities could be increased to achieve balance. I knew that I would be scolded after the new system was implemented, but I had to make this decision. What I should admit today is that I used the wrong wording. I should not have used the words "Customs Gold Unit", which would lead to the charge of destroying finance. In fact, the unit system was originally based on one Gold Yuan (金圓) from "August 19th" as the base. Strictly speaking, the increase in public utility prices is still lower than that of general commodities. If we use "August 19th" as the base period for statistics, the increase in commodity prices is 1250 times for cotton yarn, 1300 times for paper, 1785 times for oil, 1225 times for rice, and 1420 times for flour, while public utilities are only 980 times. Therefore, if the City Council believes that the increase in public utility prices is too high and can have a better way to reduce the burden on the people and continue to maintain public utilities, the municipal government is willing to accept it wholeheartedly and seek improvement.</p>
<p>Central Bank Has Always Strived to Subsidize Public Utilities</p>
<p>Central Bank Representative Chen Yanzuo: The Central Bank did not express opposition to the unit system for public utility prices at the time, or it can be said that it was equivalent to agreeing. Public utility prices must always be fair, and it is not a good policy to force them down. In the past, the Central Bank has always strived to subsidize public utilities. In February alone, the total amount of loans reached about 1 billion yuan before and after. Later, due to various difficulties, it had to be terminated. The Central Bank has done its best in this regard. Moreover, the central government has full power over loans, and the Central Bank has no right to decide.</p>
<p>Speaker Expresses Opinion, Hopes for Central Government Loans</p>
<p>Speaker Pan: The increase in public utility prices should not be blamed on the municipal government, the Public Works Bureau, or the Central Bank, because they are all powerless. The Central Bank does not want to issue banknotes. In short, the war will not stop for a day, and it will not be possible to reduce expenditures. Today we are seeking a solution in a helpless situation. The current problem lies in: (1) the base problem - which can be studied by the subcommittee, (2) the multiplier problem - if the cost of living index is used as the standard, it should be adjusted every half month, and the current difficulty lies in how to compensate for the difference between the period after the publication of the first phase index and before the publication of the second phase index. I believe that the central government should be asked for help, taking into account that the people of Shanghai are really unable to bear the burden, and asking the central government to lend public utilities the cost of buying fuel for half a month to maintain the company.</p>
<p>Pricing in Customs Gold Units Will Inevitably Create a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Xu Xueyu: Pricing public utilities in Customs Gold Units is absolutely inappropriate. I suggest using the cost of living index as the standard and first determining a reasonable base price. To compensate for the disconnection between the upper and lower phase indexes, the payment period can be limited, and overdue payments must be paid according to the lower phase index. If the difference between the cost of living index and the exchange settlement increase is too large, the base can be adjusted appropriately. Zhang Zhongyuan: Suggests (1) Please ask the municipal government to abolish the settlement of public utilities in Customs Gold Units from today to benefit currency credibility and maintain people's livelihood. (2) Please ask the supervisory committee to investigate whether the competent authorities have colluded with the company. Zhang Zhihan: Pricing in Customs Gold Units will inevitably create a misunderstanding. The Gold Yuan is equivalent to having a name but no substance.</p>
<p>Since We Cherish Subsidies, Why Issue Large Banknotes?</p>
<p>Jiang Haoran: Advocates setting a base and using the cost of living index as the adjustment standard. Qu Yue: Advocates restoring the subsidy policy, unless the Central Bank announces today that it will no longer issue new banknotes from now on, otherwise the losses of public utilities should be resolved by the Central Bank. Li Wenjie: (1) What should be condemned is the central government's policy. Why are large banknotes constantly issued, and why are we only cherishing these small amounts of subsidies for public utilities? (2) The price of public utilities should be adjusted based on the cost of living index, and the difference should be paid by the Central Bank. Zhou Xiangsheng: The government should take into account the burden on the people, and the loan should be continued.</p>
<p>Where Did the Past Deposits Go?</p>
<p>He Chengfu: (1) According to the Public Works Bureau's statistics, one degree of electricity requires one kilogram of coal. Why doesn't the Public Works Bureau find a way to save electricity, so that it can save coal? (2) When public utility companies cannot maintain operations, citizens can pay in advance, but they should never be priced in Customs Gold Units. Zhu Fuyu: According to statistics, before the war, the price of electricity in this city was equivalent to more than one cent in US dollars per degree, and today it has reached more than five cents. Why has the cost increased four times? Therefore, the public utilities themselves should be reviewed. Yu Shun: Where did the electricity deposits and guarantees paid by citizens in the past go? This should be investigated.</p>

<p>The daily necessities allotted to public school employees throughout the city by the Public School Employee Material Supply Committee of this city, except for rice, sugar, and salt, can still be supplied monthly without shortage. As of March, coal briquettes have been delayed for three periods (January, February, and March), totaling six dan, and cooking oil has been delayed for four periods (December, January, February, and March), totaling twelve catties. If each is valued at the current market price, the two items are worth more than 50,000 yuan. Since March and April, the meager monthly income of public school teachers and staff has been almost exhausted by buying coal and oil, and they are unable to cope. Recently, employees of various agencies have been asking "When will oil and coal be supplied" every day, hoping that the authorities can take into account the difficulties of poor public school teachers and staff, and urge the Supply Committee to order the Coal Adjustment Committee and the Zhongzhi Oil Factory to allocate physical goods in the shortest possible time, or promptly issue the difference in cash at market prices.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Yongjia Road Robbery Case; One Criminal Arrested in Ningbo <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the 20th of last month at about 10:15 pm, two masked robbers broke into the home of Shi Zhang Xuezhi at No. 25 Heng'an Lane, Yongjia Road, over the back wall. They threatened the maids and servants in the house with guns and locked them in a small room on the chess board, arbitrarily searching and robbing. They stole a gold necklace with a chicken heart pendant, a solitaire diamond ring, two gold rings, two pairs of pearl earrings, a gemstone ring, and a radio. The victim shouted loudly on the balcony, and the robbers threw the radio on the side of the road and fled. At about 11 o'clock, the victim reported the situation to the Lujiawan Police Station. Chief Song immediately ordered the section chief and patrol officer Jiang Zhaolong to supervise police officers Li Zihua and Xu Xiangyun to mobilize overnight and search in the territory's hostels, but without any clues. However, according to the original owner, on the third day of the Lunar New Year, a fellow villager Zhang Yaohui, accompanied by two strangers, came to the house to pay New Year's greetings, and the two left soon after, and Zhang had stayed for two nights. Patrol officer Jiang believed that Zhang Yaohui was suspected, so he sent police officers to pay attention to the arrest. He then learned that Zhang had returned to his hometown and now lived at No. 90 Tongqing Lane, Gongwei Road, Ningbo. On the 5th of this month, he also sent officers to rush to Ningbo and, together with local police officers, arrested the criminal Zhang at his address and brought him back for interrogation. He confessed to participating in the robbery and also confessed that his accomplice Yang Jun, who was keeping watch at the door, was hiding at No. 88 Male Lane, Zhongzheng East Road. Later, the case-handling police officers arrested him at his address. The gunman Zhu Shijun is still at large and is currently being pursued.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Judge Qian Songsen of the District Court yesterday concluded and announced the verdict in the case of Gu Haitao and others extorting money from Ding Yuanqing and Ding Yuquan, the owners of the China Fuxing Tobacco Company: Gu Haitao was sentenced to two years of imprisonment with a two-year suspension for jointly seeking illicit gains by taking advantage of opportunities for matters that are not under his jurisdiction or supervision.</p>
<p>The defendant and Gu Hongliang, Zhu Yonglin, and others learned in January 36 that Ding Yuanxiang and Ding Yuquan were suspected of being traitors and were being tried by the court. They conspired with Yuan Hongjue, the former group leader of the Second Hall of the Ministry of National Defense, and others to falsely report to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters in Yuan's name that there were communist bandits rioting in Shanghai. After finding out the location, they would report by telegram again, and at that time, they would ask for assistance, etc. Yuan promised to the ministry, and on the morning of the 8th of the same month, he led Gu and others to the Fuxing Company and threatened Ding Zipanquan under the name of investigating communist bandits and traitors, and also called the inspector general of the inspection department of the police department to report that the previously reported communist bandits had now been detected, and asked them to send personnel to arrest them as soon as possible. He deliberately did not indicate the location and hung up the phone, so that the department could not send personnel to the department in order to achieve the purpose of jointly defrauding money. Later, he told the company that if it could donate 200 gold bars, it could guarantee that nothing would happen. The company knew that they were false and reported the matter to the Garrison Headquarters, which arrested Yuan and Gu, and the remaining criminals were at large. In addition to Yuan being tried by military law, Gu Haitao was transferred to the District Court for judgment as above.</p>

<h3 id="e85">The Unstable Reality in Southwestern Guizhou <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Guiyang, 1st] Today's Guizhou, situated in the gap of neighboring provinces' laissez-faire attitude, spends its difficult and hard years. Although the authorities have the determination of loyal officials and unfortunate sons, using a constant attitude to respond to all changes, hoping to drag through this turbulent situation in the Central Plains, the short-sighted people, seeing that the people of other provinces have enough to eat and drink and act arbitrarily, only care about the immediate benefits, regardless of the consequences in the future. Moreover, ambitious people everywhere instigate and call, and ignorant villagers are of course easy to rise up and stir up trouble. This is most evident in the rampant banditry in the southwestern counties of Guizhou recently, which is really enough to make the Guizhou authorities, who have always been known for their stability, feel headache and烦恼.</p>
<p>Southwestern Counties of Guizhou</p>
<p>are bordered by Tianxi, Xilong, Leye, and Tian'e in Guangxi, and Luoping, Shizong, Pingyi, and Zhan益 in Yunnan. It can be said that the banditry in the border area of these three provinces of Qian, Gui, and Dian has never been completely suppressed since the Republic of China. In that area, local chieftains ran rampant, officials were corrupt, and the people could not make a living, so they had to go to "Liangshan." Although they robbed homes and houses, they rarely killed or set fires. Such bandits, at most, only disturbed the people and made the local area uneasy. In recent years, since communist elements such as Zhu Jiabi and He Zhengping led students with ambitious ideas from the Southwest Associated University to participate in the bandit movement in the border area of the three provinces of Dian, Qian, and Gui, they superficially sympathized with the poor and weak people, secretly colluded with local chieftains, gentry, and all evil forces, and slowly instilled political thoughts and political propositions into the minds of those bandit leaders who only knew how to rob homes and houses in the past. As their power grew day by day, their ambitions grew day by day, and they have evolved to the point where this border area of the three provinces can be said to have long become a world where bandits run rampant.</p>
<p>The southwestern counties of Guizhou are under the jurisdiction of the Xingren Special Office of the Third Administrative Inspectorate District. The neighboring Xingyi County was formerly known as "Huangcaoba" and is known for producing opium.</p>
<p>This is the Source of Bandits</p>
<p>Recently, counties such as Xingren, Xingyi, Ceheng, Wangmo, Panxian, Puan, Qinglong, and Guanling have been plagued by bandits everywhere, travelers have been stopped, and even the Kunming-Zhijin National Highway has been blocked, and postal and telecommunications services have been intermittent, creating an unfortunate situation where the government controls the county seat and the bandits control the countryside, all due to opium. To sum it up in one sentence, other provinces are planting, but Guizhou insists on eradicating; the people insist on planting, but the government insists on eradicating; and ambitious people call on their followers to use armed force to protect the people's planting of opium, thereby coercing ignorant villagers to rebel. As a result, banditry is getting bigger and bigger. Therefore, in Guiyang today, some people openly advocate "Guizhou should quickly lift the ban and allow the people to plant opium" under the pretext of "enriching provincial finances" in order to exonerate those opium bandits, and even say that it can therefore make the local order repeatedly stable. This is beside the point, but I mention it in passing.</p>
<p>Currently, the bandit situation in the southwestern counties of Guizhou is still</p>
<p>Most Serious in Panxian</p>
<p>When I reported on the security situation in the border area of the three provinces of Dian, Qian, and Chuan last time, I said that although the old nest of Long Tengxiao, the chieftain of the Nuozhai chieftain in Panxian, was occupied by the provincial and county teams, and he himself led the remnants to flee to Pingyi County in eastern Yunnan, it was still a big question whether he would take the opportunity to make a comeback. This opportunity did not disappoint Long Bandit. After he led the remnants to recuperate in Pingyi County, he re-established contact with bandit leaders such as Qian Baliang, Chen Yunfei, and Ding Yuesong, and returned to his old nest in the middle of this month, and attacked Tulu坝 between Panxian and Puan. Although there were only more than 200 people, it has already shaken the neighboring counties of Puan and Qinglong. Fortunately, the provincial and county teams worked hard and suppressed the bandits back to the southern area of Panxian. However, more than 1,000 bandits who had fled from the southern area of Panxian were recently discovered in the Qingshan area, which is 60 li away from the Xingren Special Office, armed with sophisticated weapons and with a sharp offensive. If these bandits were to gain power, they could occupy Xingren and Xingyi, and then respond to Ceheng and Wangmo. All the counties in the North and South Panjiang River basin will be greatly affected. Fortunately, after the provincial and county teams, under the supervision of Lu Jie, the special commissioner and deputy commander of the suppression of bandits in the southwest area, fought fiercely for a week, killing more than 200 bandits, capturing more than 100 bandits, and seizing more than 30 guns. The bandits returned to their old nest in Panxian to reorganize. Why did Long Tengxiao's ashes rekindle and his power become more and more powerful? One is that the county magistrate was newly transferred, and the deployment was lax. The other is that Wei Huanzao, the commander of the provincial security regiment responsible for the suppression, did not move in the Laochang area for nearly a month, which allowed the bandits to slowly recuperate and reorganize. Therefore, after the provincial government reviewed the results, it first transferred Wei to the Ministry for investigation and handling, and sent Jiang Zhongqing to take over and issue a telegram to suppress the bandits. Furthermore, since the local bandit forces have already had a slight political nature, military force alone cannot be effective. Recently, Zhao Fu is being carried out for Ding Yuesong, and a policy of differentiation has been adopted for Chen Yunfei and Qian Baliang, intending to separate them and carry out separate annihilation. If Long Tengxiao is once isolated and divided, Panxian may still achieve temporary stability.</p>
<p>Townships on the Border Between the Two Provinces</p>
<p>have never had a quiet life. Recently, it has been rumored that four or five townships in Xingyi County have been disturbed by Zhao Zong匪徒, and the residents are restless day and night. The two counties of Ceheng and Wangmo, located on the north bank of the Hongshui River on the Qian-Gui border, are often harassed by bandits from Leye, Tianxi, and Xilong in northern Guangxi. Not only do they constantly occupy townships, but even the county towns of Ceheng and Wangmo are under constant threat. The county town of Ceheng currently only has a company headquarters of the provincial security regiment stationed there. Not long ago, bandits from Xilong besieged the county town. Fortunately, the garrison troops held on firmly, and reinforcements arrived from the surrounding townships, and the bandits besieging the city retreated to their old nest in Xilong. The county town of Wangmo is guarded by the county government's standing civil defense detachment. The detachment leader, who is an Yi person, suddenly led his troops to rebel late at night on the Lantern Festival of the lunar calendar, besieging the county magistrate's bedroom. Fortunately, the county magistrate, Sha Yinghuang, was a soldier and was good at dodging, so he escaped in a hurry and led his bodyguards and armed police to defeat the rebels, but he had already suffered a great shock.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Making Hangzhou Prosperous: From Ren Xianqun to Yu Jimin <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Huang Xingtian</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 6th] After the Guangzhou Executive Yuan meeting on January 17 decided to reassign Zhou Shu as the chairman of Zhejiang Province, Ren Xianqun, a capable cadre under Chen Yi, immediately resigned from his positions as the mayor of Hangzhou and the director of the Materials Utilization Committee to Chairman Chen.</p>
<p>Ren Xianqun Farewell Party</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Gongqia, who was delayed by the "February 28th" incident, when he rose again in Zhejiang, he came to his hometown with full enthusiasm and hope to serve the elders, ready to do a great career. (He spent eight months formulating a ten-year plan for Zhejiang's economic construction), while Ren Xianqun came to Hangzhou with the same spirit, becoming a faithful implementer of Chen's ideals. Therefore, although Ren's administration of Hangzhou was only a short 80 days, its impression was deeply imprinted in the minds of the 500,000 citizens of Hangzhou. When Ren left Hangzhou with Chairman Chen, the citizens of Hangzhou saw him off with warm emotions. This emotion was expressed at the farewell party held at the Pacific Theater, the largest cinema in Hangzhou. The farewell meeting was chaired by Mr. Zheng Xiaocang, dean of the Teachers College of Zhejiang University, who expressed his infinite regret for the hasty departure of the two. The rostrum of the meeting was filled with various dazzling banners, and the people's representatives from various districts came to present banners. Moreover, one citizen volunteered to speak, and as a result, he said: "The government has been shouting about revolutionary nation-building for more than 30 years. Only Chairman Chen and Mayor Ren have truly practiced revolutionary nation-building and are truly officials who seek the welfare of the majority." I have never seen such a spontaneous and high-spirited emotion at various "farewell official meetings."</p>
<p>Middle School Students Talk About Good Officials</p>
<p>After Ren left office, the Hangzhou-based reporters, in order to express their regret, broke the rules and invited the official to dinner, but because there were too many banquets, they changed to eating noodles in the morning. Poor reporters were willing to spend so much money to banquet an official because the sincerity and spirit of the public servant truly touched their hearts. A few days later, I accidentally heard two junior high school students chatting in front of the West Lake Museum, talking about the outrageousness of prices and the abominable corrupt officials. I asked them if Mayor Ren was a corrupt official? They said in unison: "Mayor Ren is a good official." I further asked them what was good about Mayor Ren? Their answer was quick: "Mayor Ren does things for our common people, so he is a good official." Another added: "He can fight against the local tyrants and evil gentry, isn't he a good official?" I learned from their school badges that they were not students of the municipal middle school. Ren had already left, and of course he would not come to buy off 13- or 14-year-old middle school students to do personal publicity. Here, I deeply realized: "Winning the hearts of the people" is truly the greatest glory of being an official.</p>
<p>Winning the Hearts of the People in 80 Days</p>
<p>Ren Xianqun's administration of Hangzhou City lasted only 80 days. Where did he go to win the hearts of the people? The main reason is what the student said, being able to "do things for our common people," which is also what the Hangzhou Southeast Daily said: "That is, he is working for the majority of poor and suffering citizens." Under this basic principle, Ren first started from rectifying the city's finances and guaranteeing the lives of public educators, and then promoted construction work from social order, urban sanitation, etc. On the one hand, he submitted a memorandum to the Municipal Council, opening a credit check to complete eight construction projects in three months. On the other hand, he carried out the design work of modern urban construction based on the geographical environment and the needs of the citizens of Hangzhou, and followed the suggestions of the public opinion circle to establish a cultural city as the goal of future work. He took such a big picture, started from small places, followed public opinion, and was unwilling to be a "West Lake Mayor," but a real Hangzhou Mayor, working diligently for the majority of small people. This is the success of Ren's proclaimed responsible politics. Although some people criticized Ren for focusing too much on publicity in his work and going too far. The so-called "going too far" is just not pleasing to the eye. In fact, at a time when Chinese politics has reached the point of losing the hearts of the people, the most important thing is political effectiveness. As long as his goal is for the benefit of the people, it is not a problem. I think the problem is that Ren should not casually give up his unfinished work because of the advancement and retreat of his superiors. Of course, this is not only Ren's responsibility, but also involves the赘癌 in Chinese politics, the entire personnel problem.</p>
<p>Yu Jimin also serves as Mayor</p>
<p>After Ren left office, the provincial government ordered Secretary-General Xu Xiongfei to act as an agent. It was once rumored that Xuan Tiewu would be the mayor of Hangzhou, and it was also heard that the old mayor Zhou Qiyu would come back to do it again. As a result, at the first provincial government meeting chaired by Chairman Zhou on March 3, it was passed that Yu Jimin, a member of the provincial committee, would also serve as the mayor of Hangzhou. Yu Jimin is a native of Fenghua, Zhejiang, and is the brother of Yu Jishi. He graduated from the Beijing Advanced Police School and served as the inspector general of the Zhejiang Provincial Police Bureau, the director of the Ningbo Police Bureau, the magistrate of Yin County, the administrative inspector of the sixth district and the commander of the district security force, a member of the Shandong Provincial Government, and the director of the Shandong East Administrative Office. When Chen Gongqia was in charge of Zhejiang, Yu was transferred back to Zhejiang to serve as a member of the provincial government.</p>
<p>With魄力重視民意</p>
<p>After Ren's order was issued, Yu first returned to his hometown and made a trip, and scheduled to complete the handover on the 11th and formally take office. Before the trip, he briefly talked about governance, saying that everything would follow Chairman Zhou's instructions to first stabilize social order, and then proceed with construction according to priorities. According to Yu's humble statement: Because he had strongly resigned from this position, Chairman Zhou had repeatedly invited him before he reluctantly accepted the new order, so the governance program had not yet been considered. Yu not only graduated from the police school and has been engaged in police administration work for a long time, but also once served in Hangzhou police administration. Therefore, with Yu's talent, to stabilize the social order of Hangzhou, all circles believe that he is more than capable. As for the construction work, Yu's魄力做事 is even better than the previous one, and seeing that Ren is deeply loved by the people in Hangzhou, he must also follow public opinion and work hard for the majority of small citizens, so that he will not deviate from the goal of being a public servant. Before Yu took office, some citizens had publicly suggested that the new mayor should solve the housing shortage in the city, renovate the streets and alleys in the citizens' area, and engage in afforestation and fish farming in the West Lake. This can also be said to be the desire of the general public.</p>
<p>Firm Heart for Big Goals</p>
<p>What I think is worth mentioning is the "design of modern urban construction" that the previous term has not yet completed. The previous term followed the suggestions of the Municipal Council and the public opinion circle, and established the intention of building Hangzhou into a cultural city, and hired the famous scholar and President of Zhejiang University, Mr. Zhu Kezhen, to chair the Urban Planning Committee to conduct research and planning work. This is a far-sighted vision. No matter how the environment changes, and how weak the financial and material resources of the municipal government are, I think that for the sake of Hangzhou, for the sake of Zhejiang, and for the sake of China, the future rulers of Hangzhou should all aim at this big goal, with firm confidence, and take one step at a time, and do one thing at a time. This will not only win the hearts of the citizens of Hangzhou, but also benefit the people of the country.</p>
<p>Spring has come to the West Lake again. At the press conference held by Chairman Zhou on the lakeside in the bright spring sunshine, he said that he would thoroughly stabilize the social order of Hangzhou in order to attract tourists and prosper Hangzhou. But can Hangzhou only rely on the scenery of the lake and mountains and "rely on one spring for three winters" to prosper? If you want to make Hangzhou "spring all seasons" to prosper, then you must enrich the connotation and build it into a cultural city. The 500,000 citizens of Hangzhou are looking forward to such prosperity.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Tracking Soldiers and Replenishing Soldiers: Corruption Arises in Changzhou <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Wujin, 7th] In the Changzhou-based reception station of the Seventh Replenishment and Training Corps of the Ministry of National Defense, Long Debin, the company commander of the Tenth Company of the Second Battalion of the Second Regiment of the corps, along with squad leader Li Jiaxiang and sergeant Zhang Yonghong, used false replenishment and training names to specially engage in kidnapping innocent people, extorting and defrauding them of white rice ranging from 3 shi and 5 dou to 6 shi. More than 80 innocent people have been victimized successively. After the case was solved, company commander Long Debin, Li Jiaxiang, and Zhang Yonghong were detained by the city defense department. After days of interrogation, Zhang Yonghong confessed to the situation of defrauding property, obtaining rice, and releasing people without hesitation. Subsequently, more than 20 innocent people were found to be imprisoned in the corps' office. Among them, Song Jiuyuan and others, because they had no rice to redeem themselves, had already been put on military uniforms and were about to be sent to fill the ranks of soldiers. Fortunately, they were rescued, and their families came to prove their identities, and they were immediately released. More than 20 other people, including Chen Yaofeng, are waiting for the missing family members to prove their identities in the post. In addition, a note was found on the body of the key criminal Zhang Yonghong, which read, "...Now please talk to Boss Qian again about the number of 6 shi, and then decide, and hope to bother you. Your brother Jiaxiang." This is the physical evidence of the extortion in the case.</p>
<p>There was also a similar situation where they used the pretext of tracking down deserters to falsely accuse good people of desertion, and to extort property and rice, which was also cleverly solved. It happened that an army sent Captain Adjutant Squad Leader and seven or eight soldiers to Changzhou City along the river to catch deserters, but unexpectedly, they also indiscriminately arrested innocent people, similar to kidnapping. They successively captured 38 people including Lu Xin'an and Xu Wuda. Among them, Xu Wuda and others were extorted huge sums of money before they were released. Thirteen people, including Zhu Xiaolong, were imprisoned and treated as deserters because they had no money. After the replenishment and training corps case occurred, they were about to abscond, and were seized by the city defense department at the station on the 6th. The 13 victims were fortunately rescued and released. After being interrogated by the city defense department, the perpetrators directly admitted that they had used their power to arbitrarily kidnap and extort money. The department transferred the case to the pacification headquarters for review and handling because of the seriousness of the case.</p>

<p>Jurong</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A certain reorganized unit has been stationed in Luoyang rural area for a long time, and the supplies are enormous, making it impossible for the villagers to bear. At first, they made excessive demands, then resorted to outright robbery. Although the facts have been repeatedly reported to the government, no concrete countermeasures have been taken. The villagers, finding it unbearable, took self-defense actions. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, in Chenwuzhuang, where the township office is located, a fierce armed fight broke out between the military and the civilians, resulting in casualties on both sides. A thorough investigation of the truth is currently underway.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Since being ordered to establish the Gold and Silver Price Stabilization Committee, the Central Bank continued to allocate raw gold needed by the city's silver firms yesterday. However, there were not many applicants, and a total of nine firms were allocated a total of 290 taels, with an allocation price of 228,000 yuan per tael. According to regulations, the deadline for silver firms to apply for gold purchases and settle payments is 1:00 p.m. on the same day. Yesterday, because it was the beginning of implementation of the allocation and sale, the firms were not yet familiar with the procedures, so the deadline was delayed until about 4:00 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Selling Pressure Dominates the Market; Chinese Stocks Decline Across the Board <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market trend turned weak, and the entire process was almost completely dominated by selling pressure. Although it was once raised by major players in the middle, the market trend fell back into emergency operation due to strong selling intentions. Yesterday, the circle's monetary conditions continued to show tightness, with daily interest rates doing around 7.75%. Everyone saw it as a market decline. Yong Yarn opened at 4.90 yuan, and after opening, it fluctuated at a low level. The market trend was increasingly small. At around 10:00, major players from securities firms sold off in large quantities, and the market trend decreased to 4.85 yuan. Retail investors entered on the dip, and the market trend rebounded again, reaching a high of 5.06 yuan. At 11:45, major players sold off in large quantities at the high, and bank firms followed suit. The market trend plummeted again to 4.93 yuan at closing. The Mei Ya market continued to be sluggish, opening at 1.75 yuan, reaching a high of 1.80 yuan, and plummeting to a low of 1.58 yuan, closing at 1.62 yuan. The Gold Public Bonds were still hesitant due to rumors of the Central Bank continuing to sell gold, and the market trend softened. Transactions were also extremely quiet.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Silk Market Flat and Weak <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The raw silk market condition yesterday was still hovering in a range. The trend was still flat at the opening of each range. Entrants were watching and trading was silent. Afterwards, the price of gold outside the circle rose, and cotton yarn rose after stabilizing first. People's sentiments were slightly stimulated, and the market trend rebounded. There was a slight closing increase at the end.</p>
<p>For 120 silk, there was a newly produced Shiny Brand commodity. The morning opened with the price of immediate cash commodity at 1.18 million. However, due to the urgency of cash in the circle, the implicit interest rate was as high as 85 yuan. People's sentiments were quite weak, and there was little desire for purchases. The market weakened and the market presented a revolving condition. Afterwards, the gold price exceeded the 240,000 mark, and the firms started to bid up the price. The desire to purchase slightly increased, and the market price gradually rose. The price once went up to 1.27 million. There was not much change until the noon closing. In the afternoon, the gold price rose again with interest, and many firms strongly supported the price. The market trend continued to be strong. The price for 120 silk was called at 1.3 million by Dongyang.</p>
<p>The raw silk market trend remained sluggish with the market's focus on foreign exchange. Firms supported the price, but trading was extremely weak due to the tight cash condition and high market interest rates. Supply and demand were both scarce, and trading was silent. D-grade 78 uniformity was offered at a price of 1.6 million in the morning. Firms started to offset their positions and the price was offered at 50,000 yuan higher. Afterwards, it was heard that the price of gold had increased and the foreign exchange trend was slightly firm. The price once increased to 1.72 million. After the high, the tight cash condition worsened and the implicit interest rate gradually increased. The firm's desire to sell became strong, and the market presented a weakening condition. The price was called at 1.7 million - 1.69 million near noon. Finally, the desire to purchase was still weak, and the market trend had no strength to rally. The noon closing was at 1.67 million.</p>
<p>The silk and satin trend was slightly weak yesterday, and the market price showed a slight decrease. Mei Ya opened in the morning with a sale price of 800,000. After opening, there was a hard pull, and the market price rose slightly by 100 yuan in the flat range. However, due to the excessive overnight interest rate, the bulls could not bear the burden, and there were still many sales in the market. The desire to purchase from the local customer firms was extremely weak, and the market trend could not stabilize due to weak people's sentiments. The price dropped back instantly, and was called between 780,000 and 790,000. Afterwards, the trend was flat and weak, and the price fluctuation range was narrow. It was still hovering around 785,000 yuan before the closing. Finally, it was heard that the gold price was still stable and the firms' sentiments were slightly good. The market trend slightly strengthened and the market price rebounded again, closing at 793,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Money Market Tightens First and Then Eases; Gold and Currency Rebound in the Afternoon <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday in this city, at the beginning of the day, various sectors generally believed that the market would continue the sideways trend of the previous day, and rumors of official sales persisted. Therefore, there was widespread support, with overnight interest rates standing at between 8.5 and 9 cents. However, at around 11:00 AM, a large amount of settlement funds flowed out from the National Bank, and the money market gradually eased, falling to between 6.5 and 7 cents with ample supply. By around 12:00 noon, the money market had become completely loose and oversupplied, with banks offering 6 cents in full supply. After the opening of various industries at 1:30 PM, the easing trend in the money market did not stop, and the overnight interest rate further fell to 5 cents, with banks fully supplying funds. However, the government's sales operations, which were the focus of the speculative market, did not materialize yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, neither foreign exchange transfer certificates nor gold were seen being sold off by the National Bank, and the Hong Kong exchange rate began to shrink steadily in the morning. As the money market turned loose again, this caused gold and currency prices to rebound upwards in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the National Bank continued to issue a large amount of 129,315,000 yuan yesterday, foreign merchant banks issued 52,357,000 yuan, major clearing houses cleared in 177,185,000 yuan, and small clearing houses cleared in 4,487,000 yuan. It is heard that the large amount of funds issued by the National Bank yesterday was mainly due to a large amount of settlement funds from the China Trust Bureau, estimated to be about one billion yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tea market began in the morning with goods turning flat from the previous day's market. Coupled with the pressure from the money market, the industry, despite the lack of tea stocks and the continued support from sellers, was unable to increase prices. However, in the afternoon, gold, U.S. dollars, and foreign exchange transfer certificates showed improvement, and people's sentiments suddenly became excited. Sellers supported prices and refused to let go, and prices rose rapidly. Prices, however, lacked significant progress due to the varying quality of the goods, and, considering the overall transactions for the day, buyers were generally unable to get what they wanted, resulting in only scattered achievements.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Tung Oil Rises in a Circuitous Way <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Tung oil market conditions yesterday were generally affected by the authorities' sales of materials and tightening of the money supply, making traders confused. However, because sources from Wuhan were blocked and foreign exchange transfer certificates repeatedly reached record highs, prices did not fall, and instead continued to move forward in a circuitous way. In the end, fully measured white oil and genuine Xihong oil were trading at between 80,000 and 84,000 yuan. Second-grade Xihong oil and green oil also rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Light-Colored Woolen Fabrics Are Active <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Standard prices for woolen fabrics have remained at a high level due to various factors inside and outside the industry, and most owners are optimistic about the future. According to historical ratios, one bolt of fancy suiting fabric could be exchanged for one dan of white rice, and in good times, could be exchanged for one bolt of Longtou fine cloth. Even with current price increases, they still cannot be exchanged for these items.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xie Xin, Dacheng, and Yuanfeng fancy suiting fabrics were all advertised wholesale at 26,000 yuan per yard. Zhanghua, Hongxiang, Yinfeng, and Xinhua were all selling at 24,000 yuan. No. 55 and Shuangmao brand Zhongyuan serge were selling at 20,000 yuan. No. 1830 was selling at 17,500 yuan. Hongxiang No. 1 fancy suiting was going for 20,000 yuan, No. 2 for 17,000 yuan, Yuecheng palicos for 16,000 yuan, and Daguangming for 13,000 yuan. Actual transactions showed that light-colored goods were more active, which is due to seasonal reasons.</p>

<p>The yarn market lacked the strength to rise. It opened slightly higher, and progress was seen at one point, due to scattered transactions from the Guangdong firms. The firms held on to their holdings and were reluctant to sell. Nearing noon, the internal cash flow in the industry remained tight, and people's sentiments were scattered. Many traders thought of releasing their stocks to see what would happen, and ultimately the market closed at the opening price.</p>
<p>42-count Lanfeng was done from 1.77 million yuan to a high of 1.83 million yuan, ultimately closing at 1.78 million yuan, up 80,000 yuan. Other counts such as Baoguang and Tiannv also rose around 80,000 yuan. 40-count Lanfeng rose 170,000 yuan, and 32-count Yinyue ultimately rose 20,000 yuan, ending at 1.22 million yuan.</p>
<p>3-count Shuangma spot goods opened in the morning at 920,000 yuan, reached a high of 960,000 yuan, and closed at noon at 917,000 yuan, rising 27,000 yuan overall. Factory orders are gradually leveling with spot goods. The last transaction yesterday was at 915,000 yuan. 20-count Shuangma rose slightly by 5,000 yuan, and each grade below 16-count showed a trend of both honor and disgrace.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market presented a hovering scene yesterday. After opening, all cloths prospered briefly under the pulling of the table helper. As the volume leaving customer hands remained stagnant and many retail investors sold to lock in profits, the rising trend finally failed to continue. The price then gradually fell into a soft range, with the results varying slightly compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth initially opened at 34,400 yuan, and after briefly reaching a high of 35,000 yuan, it immediately plunged, reaching a low of 33,600 yuan. The noon close slightly rebounded to 33,800 yuan, similar to the previous day, with no change in price.</p>
<p>Mid-range fine cloths such as Laba brand Tong and others revealed a bit of elegance. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge rose from 33,400 yuan to 34,200 yuan, ultimately closing at 32,900 yuan, down 100 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong rose 1,100 yuan, ending at 33,500 yuan. Shilin cloth and other colored cloths mostly remained at their original levels without moving.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Strolling Through the Market: Spectator's Corner <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Hoarding Goods Is Not as Good as Lending at Interest; Hence the Amazing Strategy of High Interest Rates; Although One Can Be Amazed, More and More Gunpowder Is Buried</p>
<p>Some time ago, everyone said that high inflation was caused by high interest rates.</p>
<p>These days, with prices sluggish, everyone is again saying that high inflation is caused by high interest rates.</p>
<p>The past argument was not wrong. Because interest is added to the price of goods, it becomes part of the cost. Then, as the tide rises, so does the boat, and prices naturally rise even more.</p>
<p>The present argument is also not wrong. Because interest rates are too expensive, hoarding goods while bearing the interest does not necessarily generate profit. So, instead of bearing the risk of hoarding goods, it is better to lend at high interest rates and collect immediate interest.</p>
<p>However, interest rates and prices are both governed by the law of supply and demand. When there is a high demand for money, interest rates naturally rise. Why is there a demand for money? Naturally, it is for purchasing goods. So, when there is a high demand for money, there is also a high demand for goods. Therefore, when interest rates rise, prices must also rise.</p>
<p>Similarly, now because everyone thinks that lending at interest is more worthwhile than hoarding goods, there are fewer people who need goods, and therefore fewer people who need money. Prices have thus become flat and weak.</p>
<p>Precisely because prices are flat, everyone believes that hoarding goods is not as good as lending at interest. Therefore, everyone wants to lend, and the supply of money increases. With a high supply of money, interest rates should naturally decrease, thus making it easier to purchase goods and prices also easier to rise. Consequently, the demand for both money and goods increases, and both interest rates and prices rise.</p>
<p>Now, because interest rates are high, everyone is lending at high interest rates. That everyone is lending at high interest rates and prices are flat is already strange; that interest rates are not decreasing is even stranger. This kind of distorted situation is actually caused by the magical views and magical methods of the financial authorities.</p>
<p>It is said that the financial authorities currently hold a certain view: let interest rates rise above prices, and divert floating capital to lending. When everyone lends, hoarders will naturally be few, and prices will become flat and weak.</p>
<p>It is also said that last Saturday, the Central Bank, based on this view, secretly asked people to go to various commercial banks and underground money shops in the city and borrow funds as much as possible at black market interest rates. Trapped in the Central Bank, they secretly used high interest rate payments.</p>
<p>It is said that the interest rate that the Central Bank paid out was actually less than the price loss from selling real goods, and anyway, it only needed to print more banknotes and issue them.</p>
<p>This kind of thinking can truly be called non-thinking; this kind of method can also be called amazing. However, the impending crisis will therefore become greater, because:</p>
<p>(1) What is borrowed must be repaid. What is currently borrowed is mostly short-term borrowing. When it is repaid, the money market will suddenly ease; the impact will be great. This is what is meant by "can be collected but cannot be released."</p>
<p>(2) High interest rates must be because someone wants them. If no one wants them, they will not rise. Now the authorities are artificially raising interest rates; then, once prices rise, they will be doubled and added on. Therefore, it can be predicted that in the future, the general price of goods will not rise until the interest is treated as a loss. When the rise exceeds the interest and is treated as a profit, a rise will inevitably be more than double or triple. Ordinarily, because of interest, a slight rise is treated as a gradual fall. When it rises again by one or two times, the severity of that situation, and the wage problem at that time, can be self-evident.</p>
<p>(3) There is also something more terrifying: the speculative market originally moves forward two steps and retreats one step. Now the overnight interest rate is at least 5 cents or more. Each daily turn is a high profit. In seven or eight days it can be doubled. Therefore, in the future, speculative prices will be flat as a fall, but when the trend comes, they must rise three or four times before falling one or two times. With such large rises and falls, the newly rich can certainly not be discussed, but the newly bankrupt will be especially numerous, and the situation of touching one hair and moving the whole body is truly unbearable to think about.</p>
<p>We really admire the authorities' willingness to use their brains. But why do they only think of turning to drinking poison to quench thirst? Doing this will only increase the crisis and there is absolutely no possibility of relaxation.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Tight Money, Few Entrants; Rice Prices Decline; Flour Mediocre, Coarse Grains Weak; Shantou Market Falls and Then Rises Again <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The rice market lacked strength to rise and ultimately declined. At the opening, goods owners continued to push up prices, and prices once rose by 500 or 600 yuan. However, due to tight money and weak buying appetite, prices then fell. The North City market's white japonica rice closed at 25,000 yuan, down 500 yuan. Bo Dao also fell 500 yuan, closing at 24,500 yuan. Special Gao Geng and others all fell 500 yuan. In the South City, both thick and thin japonica rice fell 300 to 500 yuan. Arrivals in the North and South markets totaled 6,929 piculs.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Prices were firm. The opening sentiment was very weak due to tight money. Vegetable oil once fell by 2,000 yuan, but then rebounded slightly. At the closing, vegetable oil was 93,000, and soybean oil was 96,000 yuan, each slightly up by 1,000 yuan. The supply of raw oil was scarce. It opened at 120,000 yuan, up 7,000 yuan alone. Small vehicle sesame oil was weak and declining. Sales of soybean cake were halted, falling by 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Remained flat. Due to the tightening of the money supply, manufacturers dumped more than 5,000 bags at the initial market, and the market trend once saw a low. Midway through, Tianjin firms fiercely absorbed supply, and the market trend suddenly turned firm. The price of bingchuan initially opened at 10,300 yuan, and the highest was once 10,550 yuan in the mid-market. The closing was slightly back down, trading at 10,460 yuan. Lao Che was done at 10,900 yuan, and the peak once climbed to 11,000 yuan. Bran was strong, up 50 yuan, and large package Fuxin was done at 8,450 yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains</p>
<p>Mostly showed weakness. Under tight cash conditions, the first part of the session of the market, customer firms absorbed the market, and the market price barely stabilized. Late in the session, the market dropped to a declining condition, winter soybeans neared closing with a call price of 21,500 yuan. Short season soybeans were called for entry to the 20,000 range. Foreign firms absorbed raw peanuts and the market uniquely strengthened by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame was flat, and red sorghum fell by 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to a reporter who is familiar with the tea industry, Longjing green tea, which is specifically sold domestically, is a large category. Although new products this year are produced everywhere, they cannot be launched simultaneously due to soil and climate relationships. Among them, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, is the earliest to develop. It is heard that "Mingqian Longjing" will be produced in about two weeks. It is also known that tea merchants in the producing areas have been actively planning production and sales matters in recent days. However, due to the impact of the sharp increase in all expenses this year, the cost is definitely not low. As a result, the attitude of the suppliers is more stubborn than in the past, and the overall picture has been completely changed. It is expected that when the market opens, it will definitely create a shockingly high peak.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Sixth District Cotton Textile Association Opposes In-Kind Collection of Yarn Tax <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association previously saw in the newspaper that Article A, Section 6 of the Financial Reform Plan of the Ministry of Finance, regarding the in-factory tax collection for goods tax on cotton yarn and other products, would collect actual goods. After discussions by the standing council of the association, they unanimously expressed their opposition and submitted separate requests to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to exempt it from implementation. The reasons for their opposition are as follows: (1) Article 1 of the Gold Yuan Issuance Measures states that the currency of the Republic of China shall be based on the Gold Yuan as the standard currency, and it was announced that all public and private accounting shall be handled in Gold Yuan units from the date of promulgation. Now, only half a year later, the value of the currency has been depreciating daily. Financial reform should first establish currency credibility to seek a balance in fiscal revenue and expenditure and to improve the lives of the people. However, changing the ad valorem goods tax to in-kind collection is tantamount to showing the people to despise the currency and value goods. The resulting abuses will greatly affect the people's trust in the Gold Yuan. (2) The accumulated malpractices of in-kind collection of land tax have already resulted in more losses than gains. Now that the government has resolutely stopped it, it is showing a new start with the people. Turning suddenly at this time to change the tax law and change the goods tax to in-kind collection, this measure seems to undermine national credibility. The government only seeks to increase tax revenue but neglects the survival of the production industry, which seems to be greatly contrary to the government's original intention of supporting industry. (3) The expenses of all industries are all recorded in Gold Yuan units. The goods tax should be paid in Gold Yuan in accordance with the law and should not be changed. (4) As for the change of the goods tax to in-kind collection, if it is said that the aim is to control materials, control the market, to contract currency circulation and suppress prices, then the government has repeatedly sold off a large amount of materials, which has not been effective. As far as cotton yarn is concerned, all substitute spun yarn and US aid yarn, which are controlled by the Central Bank, account for more than 70% of the total output. Therefore, the government is sufficient to exert the power to control the market and suppress prices, so there is no need to drain the pond to catch all the fish, and also destroy the only fragile foundation of the textile industry. It is also heard that the association has sent separate letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Industries to advocate for strong support.</p>

The strengths of both sides are evenly matched, making the outcome difficult to predict. The Shanghai Police have a strong frontline, with Liu Longxin's shots being particularly sharp. Fluorescent also has a well-rounded team with a good playing style. Their strong defense is more than capable of thwarting the opponent's attacks. Today's match will determine not only the middle-level championship but also whether they can be promoted to the senior level. The lineups announced by the representatives of the two teams yesterday are recorded below:</p>

<p>In a Sino-British friendly football match, the British Navy's London Fleet will launch an attack for the second time, meeting the city's strong Chinese football team, Longtou, at Yiguo at 4 PM today. Tickets are priced at 400 yuan for general admission and 600 yuan for special admission. Sales will begin at 2 PM at the entrance of Yiyuan.</p>
<p>Longtou has gathered talented players under the command of Northeast Wind, rising in the coastal area. They were frustrated in the A-League and suffered an unfavorable start in the Mayor's Cup, being eliminated by Zhichao, which is unfortunate. However, upon inspection, the team is very complete. Zheng Bingyi in defense, Wang Baoshan in the center, and Chen Qin in the inner forward line are considered the three heroes. Others such as Wu Kaimin, Zhang Jiliang, Jiang Xian, and Xia Shufu are all experts in their respective positions. With a neat formation and good cooperation, their strength should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>The British Navy drew with the Railway team last week, but the team maintained a one-goal lead until a few minutes before the end, when the Railway team equalized. Furthermore, the foreign general Bo Beiqi was injured and left the field, leaving only ten players in the second half. Otherwise, the Railway team would have had difficulty reversing the decline. This shows their bravery and skill. The team is particularly outstanding for the speed with which the ball reaches the players. Longtou must pay a considerable price to destroy this team. A fierce and intense battle is to be expected.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Celebrating Malaysian Victory; Singapore Plans to Build Stadium for Next Competition <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>[Singapore Airmail] The Malayan badminton team has shocked the world of sports by defeating the American and Danish teams in its distant expedition to Europe. This is not only the glory of Malaya, but also the glory of our overseas Chinese, because the eight athletes from Malaya and team leader Lin Quanyu are all Chinese. It is more accurate to say that they represent China rather than Malaya. Now, the Malayan badminton team has lived up to expectations, eliminating the American and Danish teams in a whirlwind fashion, bringing the gold Thomas Cup, worth 1,700 pounds, back to Malaya. For this reason, enthusiastic people in Singapore are preparing to organize a grand ceremony to welcome the triumphant return of the team.</p>
<p>Since the news of the victory came from London a few days ago, no fewer than a hundred congratulatory telegrams have been sent from Singapore alone, including those from the Governor and the Deputy Secretary, not to mention those from the mainland of the Federation of Malaya. However, many enthusiastic people believe that this is not enough to express their enthusiasm for celebration. They believe that donations should be made as soon as possible to help the team's expenses, because the team still lacks about 10,000 yuan. In addition, it is necessary to raise funds to build an indoor badminton hall for the next (1952) Thomas Cup competition. Moreover, Zeng Zhicheng, vice chairman of the Singapore Badminton Association, told reporters yesterday that he has already called a meeting of various people to discuss how to hold a grand triumphal parade to welcome the athletes who have won the world badminton team championship representing Malaya, and to send a band to the pier or airport to meet them.</p>
<p>Legislative Councilor John Laycock suggested that the governments of Singapore and Malaya jointly organize a grand welcome party. Laycock said that this little-known Malaya is not only famous for its rubber and tin, but also for its outstanding badminton, which will make it famous in Europe and America. Laycock added: "I personally wish to donate 1,000 yuan to prepare a feast to celebrate the victorious return of the Malayan badminton team, and I hope that the government will announce a systematic plan as soon as possible to raise funds from all walks of life to quickly build a modern badminton hall."</p>
<p>Many people are now puzzled as to why Malaya (including Singapore) has such excellent badminton talents, but still does not have suitable badminton court facilities. When the world's badminton players come to compete for the next Thomas Cup in three years, how will they be accommodated? Because the three-year period is not too far away, preparations should be made as soon as possible.</p>

<p>— Translated by Cang Long</p>
<p>But when I was assigned to various overseas locations, I encountered the same kind of sad events. I went through the Aleutian Islands, Africa, and England with a large group of boxers. In March 1944, in Salisbury, England, I wanted to buy a ticket at a private theater. The female ticket seller apologized because the American military commander in that area had instructed that only white soldiers were allowed into the theater, and black soldiers were strictly prohibited. Later, this matter was reported to Major General John Lee, who was then General Eisenhower's deputy. After an investigation, the commander who established this rule in the area was immediately transferred back home. At the same time, the General Headquarters of the Expeditionary Force immediately issued an order stating that if any place prohibits American soldiers from entering, then this prohibition applies to all American soldiers, not just black soldiers.</p>
<p>While overseas, I visited England, Scotland, Africa, Italy, etc. When I was just a poor kid in Detroit, I never thought I would see these places.</p>
<p>In 1943, Marva gave birth to a girl in Chicago, whom we named Jacqueline, and she is now five years old. There is also a boy named Joe Jr., who was born in 1947 and looks a lot like me.</p>
<p>Even before I joined the army, Marva talked to me about retirement. She said that I had already achieved enough fame and fortune. I had held the heavyweight championship for the longest time in boxing history, and I had made many friends. She said that if I continued to cling to it, one day someone would beat me, and the reputation I had struggled for all my life might be ruined. My manager also said the same thing to me. He wanted me to retire at the same time as my championship title.</p>
<p>I often played bowling, but most of the time, I spent playing golf.</p>
<p>I thought that if I no longer engaged in boxing, then with all the money and property I had now, as well as the income from exhibition matches, I could live a very good life. I also had my businesses, such as Joe Louis Enterprises, which was doing very well. Joe Louis Beverage Company's products were selling well in 31 cities in the United States and in South America. I was also the vice president of a senior life insurance company, and I organized the Joe Louis Youth Club and served as a director of the club.</p>
<p>I opened a Chicago Automobile Business School in a car dealership in Chicago. I didn't want to make money from this school. Anyone can enroll, but I still liked to teach those black students. These students often had a harder time finding jobs than white students after leaving school. I especially wanted to give a chance to kids like me, kids who would only rely on their hands to work.</p>
<p>I didn't want to continue boxing. I knew that if I dragged on, I would eventually suffer a setback. Everyone should think that one day they will be defeated. So, aside from exhibition matches, if I signed a contract to fight someone again, then that fight would definitely be the last one in my boxing career. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e116">Football Commentary Last Week <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Gong</p>
<p>Last week's Mayor's Cup football semi-final produced the biggest miracle in three years. The defending champion and undefeated team for three years, Qingbai, was eliminated by China Aviation, with a score of 2 to 1.</p>
<p>The Railway team, with the ambition to win the Mayor's Cup, defeated Zhiqi Association 3 to 1 to win the final. The two teams are scheduled to hold the final this weekend to determine who is the new champion. Qingbai's defeat means that the Railway team has lost a strong opponent, and they can rest easy. But it remains to be seen this weekend whether China Aviation will invite several strong players from Hong Kong to help them in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The two semi-finals showed the low level of football in Shanghai, lacking wonderful performances, but the battles were quite tense. The young players were particularly hardworking, trying their best from the start to the last minute. In addition to working hard, China Aviation relied on some luck to beat Qingbai. Zhichao lacked luck and was overwhelmed by the more experienced Railway team. The processes of the two battles are commented on below.</p>
<p>"Do not indulge small enemies, do not deceive young players"</p>
<p>Qingbai's defeat was due to the mistakes mentioned above. Before the match, they did not take China Aviation, which had been repeatedly defeated recently, seriously. Their spirit was somewhat relaxed. Furthermore, their state was not good, and the generals were distracted. Although their offense was strong, they failed to deliver the final blow to China Aviation's spirit. As China Aviation's young players' style of play became smooth, and the midfield was controlled by China Aviation, Qingbai's goal was filled with the sounds of Chu songs.</p>
<p>Qingbai's defense still had a steady performance. Sanmao was the best in the team. Qingbai's forwards lacked the power to attack, and their coordination was scattered. Liu Long was not a center forward material and temporarily filled this position, acting slowly. Xiao Gu was good at dribbling, served as a winger but lacked the skill of crossing, and Ti Yin lost his form. Lu Sheng's performance was far below his usual level. Only Xiao Luo fought alone, how could he fight against the crowd? Although they had fifteen corner kick opportunities, there was no forward who was good at using headers, which can be said to have missed fifteen good opportunities. The inability of the forwards led the defenders into a bitter battle. China Aviation only had two best opportunities, and was able to grasp them. Gao Xiuqing bypassed the clumsy Meng Yiliang, and in a flat shot, Yin Qingbing passed the ball through a triangular formation, deciding Qingbai's fate in the last two minutes of the game, shattering Qingbai's dream of winning two championships. In the second half, Qingbai relied on Jin Lusheng to knock on the door from a very narrow angle, the ball sliding into the net from the side of the post, becoming 1 to 1. There was hope of turning defeat into victory, and they continued their offense for several minutes, but Xu Fusheng had a steady performance and some luck. "The goal is as deep as the sea," and the defenders fought hard, Qingbai's forwards had no way to get in. Meng Yiliang closely marked the fast-running Xu Zuguo, Yin Qingbing avoided the electric heart and detoured from the left to score, avoiding the solid and attacking the weak, making Huang Shijie unable to cope.</p>
<p>China Aviation's victory was achieved through the efforts of the entire army. Jin Chuanhan devoted himself to his duty, Xie Xichuan had one of his best performances this season, Chen Xiaoping was old and experienced, like an old horse who knows the way. At critical moments, he was able to seize the opportunity, preferring to kick the ball out of bounds rather than let Qingbai's forwards have the opportunity to control the ball and shoot. Therefore, he personally gave Qingbai seven corner kicks. If Qingbai had won against China Aviation by taking advantage of the corner kicks, then the blame would be on Xiaoping. However, Qingbai failed to attack repeatedly in the corner kick opportunities, because since Qu Yongfu retired, the skill of heading has not been continued. This has also contributed to Xiaoping's accidental success. Therefore, Xiaoping's merits and demerits are in the hands of Qingbai. In short, in terms of strength, China Aviation is not as good as Qingbai, but unfortunately Qingbai failed to maintain its state, and China Aviation relied on courage and luck.</p>
<p>Good strategy, Railway wins Zhichao</p>
<p>It is most unwise to attack firmly against firmly. The Railway team had considered carefully before facing Zhichao. In the match, they avoided the solid and attacked the weak, avoiding Wu Qixiang, who was in the center, and used skilled small "passes" to control the midfield. The offense was then launched from both wings. In military terms, this is to attack the place that is not easy to defend. Wu Qixiang was in the center, and his whip could not reach. The first goal was lost because Lin Dianxi lured Qixiang out and crossed the ball, Zhang Jie passed it again, and Wu Binghao pushed it in. Although the two wings flew together, it was also due to the ability of the two wings to cut in. The Railway team could have had the hope of a 3-0 score, because Dianxi was too hasty and shot the goal post. Zhang Jie was worried about gains and losses, heading the ball straight into Sheng Bide's arms. This was a threatening offensive by the Railway's three armies. The second goal was lost due to Qixiang's carelessness, he was confident in his unique skills, and no one dared to approach him. Who would have thought that Ziwen would suddenly emerge from the side and score the goal? Zhichao's defense only collapsed after Qi Qun was transferred from defense to center forward, resulting in the loss of the third goal. If Qixiang had not taken the position of forward, then Zhichao would have lost at most two goals, and their morale would not have been affected by the small defeat. However, after Qixiang went out, morale was depressed and the formation was shaken. Although they managed to pull back one goal, it was still not enough to offset the loss of morale.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy were Wu Qixiang and Gao Baozheng's wonderful performances as the third inner defense. They kicked and headed, and their footprints could be seen almost everywhere in the hinterland of both sides. They rescued the dying and helped the injured, and made the greatest contribution. The Railway team had skilled coordination. The young players of Zhichao tried their best to fight. They had the skill of passing the ball as soon as they got it. The two wings flew together. When they reached the goal, they still lacked the skill of the final shot. The right wing still needed Qixiang's skillful footwork and ball control.疾走传中亦有佳作，江雷在供球在掠夺，俱见功夫。上半时，虽先失一球尚足能与铁路相持，惟在下半时，拼力逆风作战，浪费气力，本拟一鼓作气，再而三，三而竭，全军气力疲竭，远不逮上半时之速度与英勇；两震不能飞矣！内卫空防矣！力穷气馁矣！这种种因素足以致志超于败阵之地。</p>
<p>Good crossing also worked well. Jiang Lei showed his skills in supplying and snatching the ball. In the first half, although they lost a goal first, they were still able to hold their own against the Railway team. However, in the second half, they fought hard against the wind, wasting energy. They originally planned to do it in one go, but they tried again and again, and exhausted themselves on the third attempt. The entire army was exhausted, far less than the speed and bravery of the first half. They could not fly with both wings shaken! The inner defense was empty! Their strength was exhausted and they were discouraged! These factors were enough to lead Zhichao to defeat.</p>

<h3 id="e117">World Coin King <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Xin</p>
<p>The Yuan Datou, which has been absent for more than ten years, has reappeared this time, and we have to look at it with new eyes. Recently, the open-air silver dollar market has been crowded with people, and the situation is unprecedentedly grand. However, because rare things are expensive, the number of silver dollars hidden among the people is quite large after all, so it is not enough to make it a rare commodity. At present, the Yuan Datou is favored only because the Gold Yuan Coupons are not promising. The general silver dollar dealers can't be said to be arrogant. But there is a coin merchant in the United States named Meyer, who can indeed be regarded as the king of coin dealers in the world.</p>
<p>Meyer specializes in buying and selling rare coins. Many people collect and cherish these rare coins like collecting stamps and antiques. Meyer has been in this business for fifty years since he was sixteen. He often conducts transactions by correspondence, so his customers are located everywhere. He receives more than 200,000 letters every year. The most in one year - 1935 - he received 1.25 million letters discussing transactions. Therefore, Meyer does a lot of transactions, and the price can be sold to the highest point. In 1933, he made a transaction totaling 220,000 US dollars, which was the largest amount in coin sales, which was bought on behalf of the collector Walter Newcomb. He once sold an 1804 Dollar silver coin for a high price of 10,500 US dollars, setting the highest record for silver coin prices.</p>
<p>Meyer has vision and foresight in doing business. In 1935, he offered a high price of 75 yuan each to solicit the Liberty Head nickel coins issued in 1913. At the time, everyone laughed at him. But by last year, each Liberty Head nickel coin was worth 3,750 yuan. Originally, the government often had to melt down many coins that were no longer in circulation. Meyer paid attention to this type of news at any time to increase its value. Because he saw the file of the Treasury Department destroying the Liberty Head nickel coins, he collected them in advance. This is Meyer's most proud masterpiece.</p>
<p>When Meyer gets a coin, he traces its history to find out its origins, the year it was issued, the quantity minted, whether it has any special significance, who designed the pattern, who engraved the plate, which mint made it, and so on. For several extremely rare coins, he has to find out who has collected them. If you browse Meyer's collection of coins, there are detailed records next to each coin. This type of information is of great interest to collectors, and therefore attracts many customers.</p>
<p>In general, people think that the value of coins always increases the earlier they are. In fact, this is not necessarily the case. Meyer said: "The oldest coins that exist today are the coins from the era of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, but each</p>

<p>Moscow has no nightclubs. In fact, you won't find a single nightclub in the entire Soviet Union, because they believe that nightclubs are a prominent symbol of capitalism. But Moscow has many restaurants, large and small, many of which have bands and singers, where people can eat, drink, and make merry.</p>
<p>A typical Moscow restaurant is the Alavi Restaurant, named after the Alavi River in Georgia. It serves Georgian and Caucasian food, and the decor is also Georgian.</p>
<p>Besides band performances and singing, there are no other entertainment programs in the restaurant. There is a dance floor in the hall. The seats around are often full, and there are private rooms on the upper floor, the best of which faces the band. Many famous American visitors to the Soviet Union, such as Hopkins, Harriman, Willkie, Nelson, and Mrs. Roosevelt, have been guests here.</p>
<p>The standard Russian dishes at Alavi start with alcohol, vodka or Caucasian cognac, along with hot bread and cold dishes. Next is turkey. Then comes the main dish, lamb, for which Alavi's lamb is famous throughout Russia for its aroma. The last dish is fruit, and if you can still eat, there's also ice cream.</p>
<p>How much does such a meal cost? Including tips, about one hundred to one hundred and seventy-five rubles, depending on how much alcohol is consumed. This amount of rubles is equivalent to about eighteen to thirty-one dollars and fifty cents in US dollars.</p>
<p>According to official Soviet figures, the average monthly wage of a Soviet worker is about seven hundred rubles, so eating such a large Russian meal is not easy.</p>
<p>Worth only one US dollar. However, the three-dollar gold coins minted in the United States in 1870 are worth more than one thousand US dollars each on the market. During the war, a type of small Roman coin disappeared from both banks of the Chegoslav River, and the price rose to ten US dollars per coin. After the war, these small Roman coins reappeared, and the price also fell, and you could buy one for less than one US dollar."</p>
<p>Last year, the King of Egypt wanted to sell off some of his coin collection. Many coin dealers from New York, London, and Paris went to bid, but in the end, Meir was chosen. Undoubtedly, Meir can make a lot of money in this rare transaction, and he also received permission from the King of Egypt to publish the letter selecting him as an advertisement. This is truly a case of gaining both fame and fortune.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Umbrella <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Hongxiang</p>
<p>The umbrella, commonly known as a Western umbrella, is now a very common rain gear item. However, when it first appeared, there was an interesting and moving story.</p>
<p>During the reign of Queen Victoria of England (19th century), it can be said that not a single gentleman walking on the street would not carry an umbrella. The novelist Stevenson once said, "Gentlemen never leave their umbrellas. In their hearts, they believe this is a symbol of decency." However, the word "umbrella" as an accessory had not yet been created in Shakespeare's time (16th century).</p>
<p>The traveler Joneas Highway was the pioneer of umbrella-carrying among English (men). Before him, no one dared to make such a bold move. When Joe walked down the street with an umbrella, the residents of London were greatly disgusted, saying that Highway had a woman's tone, and that people had no reason to avoid the rain given by God. They poured water on his head, threw rotten fruit at him, and followed him with ridicule. But Highway ignored everything, held up his giant umbrella, and said to himself, "In the near future, everyone will carry one." But this sentence did not come true. Thirty years later, umbrellas were not widely used. Only small restaurants and coffee shops had one or two, which were rented out to customers like cars. This is a very strange thing. Hundreds of years ago, the driest country knew how to use umbrellas before England. In places like Burma, umbrellas had become very common, but white umbrellas were reserved only for emperors and sacred white elephants. In ancient times, the East used umbrellas as symbols of royal power. From the carvings of Egypt and Sumer, it can be found that thousands of years ago, umbrellas were extremely famous.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, the most famous and outstanding figure in the United States, always carried an umbrella made of cotton cloth whenever he went out on horseback.</p>

The pen of commentary is like a knife, and the writing is even more heroic than the singing. Occasionally, I make comments about the actors and their value rises after your criticism.

<p>— Wang Lintai</p>
<p>Reading modern history, we know that the peasants suffered the most during the Taiping Rebellion. From the end of the Daoguang reign to the 21st year of the Xianfeng reign, disasters occurred frequently, and taxes were unavoidable, and many additional taxes were levied. After the new grain was fixed, old taxes were also pursued, and the baojia and militia were charged fees and conscripts according to the amount of land. Those who had land could not sell it even at a reduced price, and even gifts were not accepted. Shen Shiguo, a poet in the fields, has a poem entitled "Ode to the Field": In the past, the field was enough to make the character "rich," but today the field is the head of the character "burden." Dragging down the legs makes the character "armor," and stretching out the head makes the character "not free." The field on the heart "thinks" is often bitter, and the field in the heart "worries" endlessly. At that time, I only hoped that the field would bring "blessing," but who knew that many fields would bring "piles" of sorrow!</p>
<p>Reading this poem today, I feel that the description is particularly vivid and meaningful. Since victory, farmers have been sitting in a city of sorrow amidst the chaos of war. Ordinary owner-farmers, in addition to paying taxes, also have "consolation money for strong men," "special self-defense donations," "reception fees for passing troops," "office expenses for township and bao offices," and "apportionment for autonomous construction," etc., in various forms and numerous categories, far more than in the past. Moreover, there are some corrupt officials who engage in fraud for personal gain, and new local bullies have cleverly established new names and levied taxes indiscriminately. The suffering of the common people is even worse than it was then, which is lamentable.</p>

<p>Some people have special preferences for certain parts of food, such as the head of the bighead carp or the belly of the eel, but I have never heard of anyone who likes to eat duck tails. Recently, I read a Qing Dynasty note, which says: "Li Biao, also known as Qianwei, a xiucai from the South China Sea, had a habit of eating pickled duck tails, and every meal required them. If his family served a whole duck, he would cut off the tail and discard the rest. If relatives and friends held banquets, and he was not provided with duck tails, he would angrily leave, even if there were rare and precious dishes in front of him. There was a wealthy family in Foshan Town who held banquets frequently and cooked lavishly. They used dozens of pickled ducks every day, but they hated the smell of the tails and ordered their family to throw them over the wall before putting them in the pot. When Qing heard about this, he sighed and said, 'To entrust a bright pearl to dung, to reject a valuable jade to mud, the world has people who go against human nature, such as this vulgar father. The world does not love treasure, I cannot bear to discard it on the ground.' So, he moved to live next door to the wealthy family and enjoyed their pickled tails every day." Everyone has different habits of preferring crusts, and this is another example.</p>

<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>The differences in languages and writing systems among the world's ethnic groups are one of the main causes of emotional barriers among human beings. If there were a universal language, it would undoubtedly add a driving force to the "One World" movement. As early as the 17th and 18th centuries, great thinkers such as the French Descartes and the German Leibniz discussed this matter, but what was lacking was concrete expression.</p>
<p>Among the early world languages, there was "Volapük," invented by the German Schleyer in 1879. Within ten years of its release, 283 Volapük promotion associations were established around the world, and books in 25 languages were translated into this world language. Unfortunately, after two more years, Volapük went from prosperity to decline and gradually disappeared. At the same time, in 1887, the Russian Dr. Zamenhof also invented a world language called "Esperanto." After its release, all relevant groups unanimously considered it a major advance in world languages, and the great German philosopher Einstein and Krompeter supported it. It initially spread in Russia, but in 1895 its publication was sealed for printing an article by Tolstoy, and its dissemination was suppressed. However, it did not die out because of this, but crossed the borders of the Tsar and spread to Western Europe, especially in France, and later crossed the sea and spread to England.</p>
<p>In 1905, the first Esperanto conference was held in the suburbs of Paris, where Zamenhof's "Declaration" was delivered, stating the intention and purpose of Esperanto, and laying the foundation for the circulation of this world language for more than 60 years.</p>
<p>At the same time, other world languages have also been introduced one after another. The earliest and most influential of these was "Ido" (Ido), produced in 1907. It was adapted from Esperanto. In addition, there are several other, less well-known, versions.</p>
<p>In 1921 and 1922, the League of Nations tried to recommend Esperanto as the official world language, but it failed to pass because the French government opposed it on the grounds of school teaching issues. However, the spread of Esperanto did not decline because of this. On the contrary, in 1939, 42 radio stations broadcast in Esperanto; at the same time, more than 6,000 books and booklets were printed in Esperanto.</p>
<p>In 1924, the "International Auxiliary Language Association" was formally established, which was a major event in the history of Esperanto. Six years later, it organized a world language research association in Geneva, gathering famous linguists from various countries to review various different world languages, hoping to unify them and avoid them diverging like natural languages. Otherwise, not only would scholars be at a loss, but it would also lose the meaning of a world language. Unfortunately, after a long period of discussion, this meeting contributed little to the practical solution of the problem. The experts present generally tended to engage in empty linguistic debates, and failed to focus on how to solve the practical problems of world languages.</p>
<p>On the bad side, language unification is a cruel means of assimilation by aggressors. However, the Esperanto movement, launched by the people in the last century, is purely motivated. Esperanto's history of more than sixty years shows an extremely valuable example and also makes a major contribution to promoting international understanding.</p>
