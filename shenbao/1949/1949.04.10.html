<h3>毛澤東電覆李代總統　說明和平談判標準　願早成立協定結束戰爭恢復和平　何院長稱政府正考慮中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中共電臺昨夜十時廣播李宗仁·毛澤東二氏來往電文，此為政府和平代表自四月一日赴平進行和談以來中共首次發表和談新聞。廣播中先行轉播中央社南京電之李代總統致毛澤東陽電全文，電後加：「新華社按：李宗仁此電，尚有許多阿Q語調，對於自已吹雷，頗饒興趣。所謂「國共合作」，毫無跡象，尤使人們感到心頭有所作逆，但在根本上說來，李宗仁在全國人民的督促之下，似乎已增長了某些希望和平成功的誠意。是否如此，且看將來。」其後又發表毛澤東致李宗仁復函，原文如下：「南京李德鄰先生勳鑒：卯（四月）陽（七日）電悉，中國共產黨對時局主張，俱見本年一月十四日聲明；貴方既然同意以八項條件為談判基礎，則根劇此八項原則以求具體實現，自不難獲得正確之解決。戰犯問題，亦是如此。總以是否有利於中國人民解放事業之推進，是否有利於和平方法解決國內問題為標準。在此標準下，我們准備採取寬大的政策。本日與張文白（治中）先生晤談時，即曾以此意告之。為著中國人民的解放和中華民族的獨立，為著早日結束戰爭，恢復和平，以利在全國範圍內，開始生產建設的偉大工作，使國家和人民穩固地進入富強康樂之境，貴我雙方亟早日成立和平協定。中國共產黨甚願與國內一切愛國份子攜手合作，為此項偉大目標而奮鬥。毛澤東·一九四九年四月八日」。</p>
<p>「本報南京九日電」毛澤東致李代總統之覆電，九日晚七時經中共廣播後，李代總統十時閱及全文，甚表欣慰。</p>
<p>「中央社南京九日電」新華社八日廣播中共毛澤東覆電李代總統消息後，行政院長何應欽九日晚答新聞界詢問對該項覆電感想稱：「尚在審慎考慮中」。</p>
<h3>首都會談頻仍　將續派員赴平　人選以張群於右任為最可能</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊九日電〕政府為促進和平談之迅速有成，可能續派大員赴平，從側面協助和平工作，此項人選及名額，經探悉九日午代總統官邸之重要會商中，業已初步提及，惟尚待十日正式分別徵詢各氏之意見，聞其名額有二，以於右任·張群兩氏最為可能，童冠賢·居正亦為考慮及徵詢意見之人選。至有人推測代總統將親往一節，據總統左右人士稱：無此可能。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕首都要員雲集，會談頻仍，顯示大局將於一二日內有新開展。關係方面九日晚透露：政府要員目前所最關切者，不僅為北平和談情形，亦包括廣州方面對和談態度。張群歸自溪口，渠所帶來之意見，顯亦被特別重視。在廣州舉行之中常會，雖同意在京設立和談指導委會，然該會是否獲有最後決定之權力，尚成問題。李代總統鑒於此項情勢，因急召在各地之要員返京，何應欽，白崇禧八日抵京後，即參加代總統官邸之集會。九日晨在滬之於右任應邀匆匆返京，赴溪口請示之張群，亦於九日午趕來。九日上下午李代總統曾個別與各要員商談，下午三時復召集在京要員作重要會商，何應欽即席報告穗行經過，特別著重中常會之決議，在穗要員之態度及穗市一般情況。張群報告溪口之行情形，旋就和談問題及其有關問題討論甚久，內容如何。與會者鹹拒絕有所透露，惟該項會議之內容確甚重要，除何氏之報告外，代總統對和談問題亦詳予討論，並曾由徐永昌，顧祝同對江防詳為報告。聞會中系研討連日來張治中之報告，與會者有於右任，何應欽，童冠賢，居正，吳忠信，張群，朱家驊，白崇禧，徐永昌等十餘人。</p>
<h3>三神秘客之一　劉子衡來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕一度引起首都政界人士興趣之自平來京三神秘客，經記者連日採訪，已獲悉其姓名為劉子衡·李民欣及朱蘊山三氏，李·朱兩氏均曾列名於一月廿二日李濟琛等五十五人發表之對時局聲明，彼等以種種客觀條件，增加甚大之神秘性，惟在記者獲悉其名單後，已全部瞭然。又在三客中最具神秘性之劉子衡氏，九日夜十一時乘京滬夜車赴滬。據劉氏行前語記者，此行系「訪友」留滬一日即返京。據九日晚中共電臺英語廣播稱：李濟琛將為任何全面和平談判之媒介。</p>
<h3>平進行和談情形　正面報道困難多　張治中電覆京滬記者</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕遠在北平進行之和談，為全國矚目之中心，但以中共既謝絕記者前往採訪，同時亦無新聞報道廣播，以是和談情形外間所知甚少，京滬記者曾經由政府代表團轉商中共代表，逐日供給發表之新聞，電京公布，頃悉：張治中已有覆電到京，表示「困難甚多」，故短期內和談進行情形，將仍無正面報道。</p>
<h3>中共抨擊張耀明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨夜中共電臺廣播中，為南京四一事件，猛烈抨擊首都衝戍總司令張耀明，指張為此一血案之直接負責者，並謂渠系在蔣總統指使下，屠殺學生。又指日前衛總發表聲明，「信口雌黃，造成誣蔑，應該罪加一等」，最後稱：張耀明如不立即「立功贖罪」，新的上峰共軍，即將渡江南進，決「執行人民的意志」，對張予懲處。此外，又稱蔣氏「反動集團」繼續迫害南京·臺灣·武漢·福州·成都等地學生，禁止遊行與示威。學生仍然受到屠殺的威協。同時又謂新華社記者曾訪問北平民主人士，彼等對於此一事件，表示嚴重抗議。李齊深表示：「這個事件，使全國人民對南京反動政府的求和誠意發生很大的懷疑。南京反動政府中某些人物，如果真是希望和平的話，就應該立刻和蔣介石集團完全隔斷。嚴辦屠殺人民的凶手，釋放一切政治犯，並投到人民方面來」。中國民盟沈鈞儒表示：南京四一事件，證明政府對和談缺乏誠意。</p>
<h3>安慶記者三人　參觀陣地受傷</h3>
<p>〔本報九江九日電〕安慶記者前在東郊參觀陣地，被共軍炮傷三人，傷情未詳。</p>
<h3>鎮江昨起提早戒嚴</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江九日電〕鎮城防指揮部九日宣布，每晚提早於十時戒嚴，車輛行人無特別通行證者不准通行。</p>
<h3>傳陳儀飛臺休養</h3>
<p>〔本報衢州九日電〕頃聞陳儀已於日前飛臺休養，惟此訊無從自關係方面證實。</p>
<h3>和談昨尚未開始　張治中毛澤東前日長談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕和談正式會議，九日仍未開始，但會前之廣泛交換意見頻繁，此舉對正式會議亦頗具協助之作用，而若幹可能成為　結之問題，亦即於此種交換意見中，覓取一致之途徑，九日晚此間接獲北平之報告，證實連日頗有進展。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕政府和談代表團首席代表張治中，八日與毛澤東作首次長談，收獲甚佳，見面情形亦好，其內容九日已由張氏發出詳細電報，報告李代總統，惟此項電報迄九日午夜止尚未收到，以上情況為張治中於九日午自平與代總統通電話所報告者。</p>
<h3>江北橋頭堡續陷　荻對江橋碼頭一度失守旋經克復　平漢南段共軍續向南進</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江九日電〕鎮江當面之三江營，經兩晝夜炮戰後，九日已情況不明。揚六線上朱家旗杆與老四圩方面共軍，九日晨至中午不斷發炮，似有積極奪取六圩企圖。十二圩·瓜洲經國軍增防後，情勢轉穩，惟集結於儀徵共軍第八兵團之二零七，二零九兩支隊約萬餘人，九日正式向十二圩進擊，守軍已會同駐泊十二圩之威海軍艦發炮還擊。又八日攻佔施家橋·三沒河向六圩猛攻之共軍，系渤海縱隊及警備第七旅，共約萬餘人，九日空軍曾不斷飛往江北岸沿線低飛偵察。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江九日電〕官息：共軍渤海縱隊近自天長方面竄抵揚州以南三　河以北地區，共軍仍在三江營以北焦家蕩·仙女廟一帶地區，廿三軍在泰縣以南口岸以北以東一帶地區，廿八·廿九·卅一·三軍主力已竄距南通·如　·海安一帶，判斷當面之共軍似為配合共軍中央政治攻勢之陰謀，而將對江北岸橋頭堡陣地施行廣泛壓力，以壯聲勢。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江九日電〕軍事當局稱：此次蘇北共軍發動攻勢，乃有計劃之行動。儀徵·泗源溝·三　河·施家橋等橋頭堡雖被攻佔，但國軍有陸海空軍嚴密配合與防范，故共軍渡江仍屬不可能之事。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江九日電〕七日鎮瓜線複航，一日開船兩班，共載旅客及難民三千餘人至瓜洲，向揚州方面進行時，適共軍向國軍進攻，在無情炮火下，計傷亡三晨餘人。</p>
<p>〔本報常熟九日電〕蘇北戰局極度緊張，各橋頭堡均加重壓力，儀徵以南之泗源溝，施家橋亦相繼撤守，十二圩戰事仍在激烈進行中。據悉：共軍渤海支隊已抵揚州，焦家蕩，仙女廟等處。廿八·廿九兩軍調至南通，如皋，海安。廿三軍在泰縣以南，口岸以北地帶集結，調動頻繁，似有渡江企圖，南岸國軍已作萬準備。江防無慮。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕軍息：（一）江北共軍陳毅部第卅六軍，於七日晚攻陷儀徵後，復向犯，於八日晚攻陷大河口，（龍潭對江西北方向）。自該兩地被共軍攻陷後，共軍之炮火將威協京滬路行車之安全，但目前在國軍陸海空兵團嚴密監視下，共軍尚未能發揮其炮火威力。（二）江甫北高旺附近，九日上午續有小戰鬥，共軍一小股約五百餘人，向南攻擾，旋經擊退。（三）八日攻陷瓜洲北三　河之共軍。刻判明系共軍之警備第七旅，該設共軍續於八日晚七時許攻陷施家橋，刻在瓜州以北與國軍對戰中。（四）共軍陳毅部第二十軍，於八日黃昏向我三江營橋頭堡陣地進攻，旋於晚八進攻陷，現該方面國軍正據守龍窩附近，與來犯共軍激戰。又，高橋（大港對江三江營南）於九日中午十二時受到共軍三千餘人進攻，守軍奮勇抵抗，現仍激戰中。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕軍息：（一）共軍陳毅部第卅軍，於八日晚向蕪湖對江西梁山，裕溪口，二　一帶攻擊，激戰澈夜，迄九日拂曉，共軍攻勢稍挫，現各橋頭堡屹立無恙，國軍仍確守原陣地，與共軍對峙中，（二）荻港對江橋碼頭於九日浸晨四時，被共軍二十七軍一部約千餘人攻陷，旋於六時經國軍反擊克復，刻仍對峙中。</p>
<p>〔本報九江九日電〕共軍第十一軍於安慶之役受重創，正後調整補，接防共軍系由桐城南下之劉伯誠部第十軍，原在宿松·太湖十五軍無變化。</p>
<p>〔本報九江九日電〕永安艦九日由安慶前線返抵九江加油，日內仍返前線，與安慶守軍配合作戰。記者於該艦甫抵潯岸，卽上艦訪問，得悉海軍此次參加安慶戰役者共×艦，由××司令官親在　艦指揮作戰，獲輝煌戰果。惟海軍戰士因在艦面作戰，亦微有受傷，記者參觀永安艦時，艦上被共軍重炮傷之處不下二十處，因安慶附近江面狹隘，最寬江面亦祇二千米矣突，尤以安慶下洋家套與寶塔下先後與共軍機炮戰不下三十次，予共軍重創。</p>
<h3>張群由浙飛返京　李代總統邀宴閻錫山研商時局</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕張群九日下午一時半專機由浙飛返京，事先知者甚少，僅何應欽一人赴機場迎接，旋卽同車返鬥雞閘官邸談話。張氏系於日前由京赴滬轉溪口，晉謁蔣總裁有所請示。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕李代總統九日午在官邸邀宴閻錫山，並研商和談八條件及時局，談甚久。九日晨九時白崇禧訪閻氏，晤談一小時許，十一時許傳涇波亦曾往訪，下午五時在京晉籍學生代表五人晉謁閻氏致敬。</p>

<h3>農貸的實際工作</h3>
<p>— 張華敏</p>
<p>目下政府雖在財政尤分支絀之中，但本年度仍擬發出钜款，繼續辦理農貸。這在以為政府一向只有向農民「取」而沒有向農民「給」的貧苦勞農大眾看來，的確是一件令人欣慰的喜訊。在此農貸行將開放之前夕，　過去辦理此項工作的經驗與教訓，亟應切實予以研討，以免重蹈過去覆轍。茲就個人在實際工作中觀感所及，提出一些意見，以供關心農貸問題者的研究與參考。</p>
<p>首先想到的是減化手續。在戰前物價穩定時期，鄉村農民購買貨物，多採「賒賬制度」，農民與商店重往來，無論欠款數目多寡，均憑賬而一筆記載，到期時，均能如期償還，發生「呆賬」者，確如「鳳毛麟角」。農民大眾講究信用的程度，可見一斑。現在辦理農貸時，手續的繁雜，書表的眾金，完全注重形式，不去瞭解農民的實際需要，死把著不合實情上級規定的原則。此種不正當傾向，在一般智識份子看來，尚有摸不著頭腦之感；所謂「目不識丁」的「老百姓」，當走向「富麗堂皇」的農貸衙門，百對「神氣十足」的銀行老　，看到五光十色的大批書表時，怎能不「踟躕不前」，「望而卻步」呢？而在農貸團體領農貸時，須備印鑑級及業務計劃，印鑑紙上又要自主要職員簽字。農民大眾，多係所謂「白丁」，「人，手，足，刀，尺，」尚不認識，如何會在雪白色道林紙精印的印鑑上「簽字」？更如何會擬所謂洋洋大計劃？要作只有讓指導人員虛編代擬，千篇一律。又有什麼用處呢？</p>
<p>除以上書表外，尚要什麼申請書契約，社員借款細數表，社員耕種田畝清冊，社員領款約據正副本等，此項繁雜書表，叫所謂「禿頭禿腦」的農民看來，怎私服不令人頭痛？農貸機構既自稱為「平民金融機構」，就應有平民化的作風，農貸書表應盡量予以減少，多方予農民以方便！</p>
<p>我們認為農貸，若係農民個別運用，僅要契約和借款細數表兩種卽可，印鑑紙上的職員印鑑，細數表後面，主要職員蓋章，卽可代表，農貸團體的圖記，細數表上既已蓋有，何必另備？申請書上的「借款金額」，細數表上「合計」欄已有，至「貸款期限」，細數表上加一欄即可，此表可予廢除。</p>
<p>至辦理集體經營的農貸，除較大規模的，需要確實可行之計劃及借據等外，鄉間農民大眾小規模的經營，只要寫份便函，說明經營種類辦法實需金額，後邊主要職員蓋章，經調查確實後，訂份借據即可。什麼印鑑紙，申請書，耕種田畝清冊等，均應一律取消。</p>
<p>其次是貸款額要配合農民需要。過去農貸人員下鄉，因貸額較大，受到農民相當程度歡迎；去年農貸機構辦理最後一批農貸時，每畝有僅放法幣十餘尤元者，（當時合金圓五分），每人最高貸額，為法幣二百餘萬元，僅合金圓七角左右　不足農民當時實際需要百分之一。所以農貸人員下鄉，到處挨罵，甚至不辦農貸，合作社農會等農貸團體，尚可有名無實存在，一辦農貨，經農貨人員講明每畝貸額後，農民地要退股金退會費，立刻解散農貸團體。這樣名議上為發展農民團體發展合作組織，實際上卻做了摧殘合作事業，摧殘農民團體！</p>
<p>據農民們說：做一天工有肉吃有酒喝，當時還可拿到老為幣工資六百萬元左右。但為了領農貨，今天合作社成立要開會，明天委員調查要開會，後天監放農貸要開會，開會時自己吃自己，拿不到工資，還要出股金，弄到結果，僅領到幾十萬元法幣，還不夠他們半天工錢，簡直是開玩笑。當時真令農貸人員，面紅耳赤，羞愧交加，無辭以對。實在是對農貸機構一大諷刺，我們認為在通貨膨脹物價未穩定期間，農貸必須根據各地實際需要，隨時調整貨額，以適應農民實際生產成本，方法合理。</p>
<p>再次便是利率問題，金融機構必須依賴存款，方能發揮力量，農貸放款利率，經前四聯總處決定為月息七分五厘，至今存款，仍僅為月息三分，現在黑市入款利率間有高達一元五六角者，相形之下，農貸利率，殊嫌過低！我們知道戰前農貸資金，大部係吸收各地遊資而來，在目前通貨日益澎湃，乞　於印刷機構去辦等於「送禮」的存款，拿到無足輕重渺不足道，月息三分左右的微利？以致農貸資金，竟大部仰賴發生為來源，殊為失策！</p>
<p>查利率的高低：係取決於市場資金的供求，與當前經濟條件的配合，供多於求，必然降低，反之求多於供，勢必增高。強用政治力量予以限制，或可見效於一時，必不能維持於長久。目前農貸機構，應商請主管當局，舉辦銀元黃金及其他實物存款，根據市場實情，確定利率高低，吸收社會大量遊資，予以安全的保障，合理的利潤，使其有正當出路，避免投入屯積居奇投機操縱的用途。以增加農貸資金的來源！</p>
<p>農貸問題，本來是整個中國問題的一環，它不能脫離我們面前實際社會環境的影響與支配，必須與全部政治經濟的改革，互相配合發展，方有順利成功的可能。在當前炮聲連天鋒火遍地，一切問題都不上軌道的環境中，我們沒有理由，單獨要求農貸辦理至盡善盡美的程度。任何工作的推動，是不是容割裂的，它需要縱的貫串與橫的聯擊。可是與辦一椿事，把過去的缺點都不糾正，更何能談什麼全盤革新或進步呢？</p>

<p>〔本報南京九日電〕京物價九日突瘋狂上漲，市場亂異常，此種現象，係由於儀徵失守，軍事情形趨緊所致，而某交通機關於九日發薪，亦為促使金鈔銀元上漲之原因。九日物價上漲，係以金鈔為前導，中午前後達最高峯，黃金每兩最高達三百七十餘萬，美鈔八萬六，銀元八萬，食米遂亦突破四十萬關，五洋市場亦一片上漲聲，是時各商店以無法捉摸，難於營業，多有打烊者，下午四時後情形稍緩和，迄晚始小回。</p>
<p>〔本報無錫九日電〕物價因受北岸戰火蔓延影響，一致狂漲，各市場益形混亂，糧市擯持乏開，場外白粳已突破卅萬大關，棉紗亦創一千萬高峯，較昨漲起四五成，小民叫苦連天，面粉九萬，荳油一八〇萬，小麥卅二萬，白麥卅七萬一千。</p>

<p>〔本報福州九日電〕此間最近三日來，因銀行本票泛濫，八日晨市場繼前兩日掀起狂漲，食米開盤廿六萬，中午卽突出卅萬關，午後情形劇變，叫價高達五六十萬，米店多將白米藏匿，持本票者均無從購取食米，但持黃金購米者，仍可以一錢二分換得白米一石，其他市場亦宛如去年十月搶購風潮之再見，下午三四時以前，尚可持本票購物，但以黃金標價之商品，瞬刻數變，下午三時以後，多數拒絕收受本票或金圓券，商店因之多提前打烊。黃金晨開每兩二百六七十萬，午刻卽達三百五十萬，傍晚四百五十萬，金店祇進不出。銀元叫價十萬，但無買賣。市民奔馳驚駭，莫可名狀。按，國省各銀行應省府及其他機關需要，自六日起按照二千七百倍墊發公教軍警員工三月份薪資，因鈔荒而臨時印發五千，一萬，五萬元之本票，迄今日止，各行共約發出七十億至一百億，卽自是日起湧入市場，搶購金鈔物價，掀起漲風，竟於三日內演成不可收拾之局面</p>
<p>〔本報成都九日電〕蓉市場入瘋狂狀態，物價漲勢猖獗已極，九日米廿四萬，金二百四五萬，大頭三萬五千，其餘紗布，百貨，煙，糖，跟蹤疾進，平均漲率逾週初十倍，八一九時萬倍，生活品幾達一日十價。</p>

<h3>東西冷戰入新階段　艾契遜強調三國西德協定　並不關閉四強協議之門戶</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓八日電〕美國務卿艾契遜今晚在記者招待會中宣稱，大西洋公約之簽字及三國成立對德協定，系在試探一項基礎，吾人希望由於此項基礎，而與蘇聯獲致協議。艾氏指陳大西洋公約及對德協定，使西方盟國之地位大為增強，不僅對於整個歐洲之態度，而且對與蘇聯有關之國際問題，均將有重大之影響。艾氏宣稱，美國對於柏林封鎖之態度並無改變，在封鎖解除以前，美國不擬與蘇聯開始談判。渠在度強調稱，三國對德協定中並無對蘇秘密之處，同時蘇聯假若願意，亦不阻止其最後參加該約。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕法外許曼今日招待記者，強調四強成立關於德國問題協議之可能性依然存在，今當輪到蘇聯表示西德之榜樣是否可以適用於德國全境。渠認三強關於西德之協定，具有今後對德採取行動的完善基礎。渠一再強調該協定並不與四強協義的可能性相抵觸，在該方面的下一行動將輪到蘇聯採取。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕國務卿艾契遜今日在記者招待會上聲稱，美國政府主張於德國聯幫共和國成立後派駐德國之高級專員，宜以非軍人擔任，至於佔領軍之數量亦將視一般安全需要而定。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓九日電〕此間美國外交界人士對於在不遠期內，恢復四國對德問題談判事，表示樂觀。彼等所根據之理由，為蘇聯代表在成功湖所取之緩和態度，及法外長許曼與美國務卿艾契遜昨日所發表之言論，強調三國對德協定並不與四國協議相衝突，僅須蘇聯解除柏林封鎖卽可，另一人使人樂觀之因素，為三國將駐德高級專員之使用否決權，限制於重要問題上。此表示英美法三國不願使蘇聯感覺一旦造成四國高級專員理事會，仍將被西方各國之否決權所壟斷。最後美官員指稱，聯合國蘇聯代表葛羅米柯似圖與成功湖之美國外交官員舉行非正式接觸，彼等認為此種非正式會談之主要內容，將為德國問題及大西洋公約問題。</p>
<h3>三國對德協定要點　俟德政府成立軍管理即取消　另設高級專員公署負監督之責</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕美英法三國外長今日下午發表聯合公報稱，德國各問題已獲完全協議，一俟德國新政府成立，決在佔領區取消軍管理，三國僅保留有限的管理權。軍事總督代以高級專員，惟佔領軍仍將繼續留駐。</p>
<p>該項協議成立於英外相貝文所謂「最重要之一週」，表示三國對德長期爭執逐告結束，德國重新回到國際集團為期不遠。三國對德協定要點計有下列數端。（一）修正佔領法規，使原來法規更簡單化。新法規規定美英法三國與德國新政府之關系，全文尚未公佈，卽將送交波恩西德制憲議會。（二）一俟德國新政府成立，卽在西德撤銷軍政府，另由三國各派一高級專員合組公署，負責監督德國新政府。佔領軍繼續留駐，各歸司令統率。（三）德國政府可自由處理國事，但三國保留權力之特定場合除外，例如防止德　武主義復活，與保持德國及外國間基本關係等。（四）德意志聯邦共和國可與美國直接簽訂協定，依照馬歇爾計劃申請援助，並得參加歐洲經合機構為會員國。此外，三國外長並商定拆卸工廠，限制工業及國際管制魯爾區等辦法。除盟國保留權力之場合外，德國政府通過任何決議三星期後卽可實行，惟若三國高級專員駁斥不准，則屬無效。</p>

<p>〔合眾社華盛頓九日電〕素主援華的共和黨眾議員周以德九日出而主持史泰遜的「亞洲麥克阿瑟計劃」。周以德同意明尼波利斯明星報社論中提出的該項計畫不應以麥克阿瑟計劃為名，而應稱之為「亞洲馬歇爾計劃」的意見。周以德告合眾社稱：不論此項計畫冠以何名，主要者在其內容。渠稱：「麥帥始終主張將亞洲問題視為一個整體，但是華府方面則始終不予重視，而且相反地訓令麥帥注意日本。」渠稱：「然而，麥帥在日本的成功，其成敗將視亞洲的局勢而定，如果亞洲赤化，日本亦必將赤化，我深知麥帥亟圖使國務部承認東亞必須被視為一個有機的整體，和西歐一樣，但國務部則似乎認為相同的理論不將施諸亞洲，他們重視歐洲，但放棄亞洲，在歐洲和亞洲，在歐洲和亞洲採取了不同的政策。」</p>
<h3>處理義屬非洲殖民地　蘇代表闡明立場　仍堅持採用聯合托管制</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約九日廣播：今日聯大政治委會中，蘇代表葛羅米柯說明蘇聯對處理義屬非洲殖民地的立場，仍堅持採取聯合托管制。葛氏稱，此舉與一九四五年美國務卿貝爾納斯在四外會議中所作之建議符合，按當時蘇方與英美法之竟見，除尹裏特利亞一部應歸阿比西尼亞一點外，意見距離甚遠，葛氏並建議，准許裏比亞於十年後獲得獨立，在此期間該地區置於聯合國托管下，設行政長官管理之。另由美，英，法，蘇，義及裏比亞之歐籍及阿刺伯籍居民組織咨詢委會，協助該長官處理一切行政，葛氏繼猛烈抨擊英國片面決定將的黎波裏坦尼亞之梅拉哈空軍基地交與美國使用，認為英國一無權作此決定。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕蘇聯今日在聯合國安理會中否決南韓之入會申請。蘇代表馬立克指出南韓政府為美國傀儡，違反人民意志。美代表奧斯汀答以南韓實為愛好和平國家。中國與加拿大代表亦贊成南韓入會。表決結果為九對二，蘇聯與烏克蘭投反對票，安理會決議法定表決票數僅須七票，但因蘇聯行使否決，全案被打消。此為蘇聯第三十次行使否決權。</p>
<p>〔合眾社成功湖八日電〕聯合國南韓首席代表趙炳玉，八日在蘇聯施用否決權，阻止韓國要求加入聯合國的申請後，立卽發表文告，指斥蘇聯「濫用及妾用否決權。」文告中稱，「我認為蘇聯的此項行動，侮辱韓國人民，同時亦為阻礙聯合國活動的另一惡意事實。」渠繼稱：「唯一的理由，卽在蘇聯決定控制及佔領朝鮮半島，俾為共產黨的征服世界政策的戰略基地」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖八日電〕南韓代表鄭桓範今日稱，蘇聯對南韓加入聯合國機構之申請，行使否決權，實為惡意行動，侮辱南韓人民。蘇聯此舉動機，無非欲利用並佔領全韓作為遂行共黨征服世界政策之軍略基地。</p>

<h3>羅雅爾指我局勢　阻礙日復興　韓國情形亦增遠東困難</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕前陸軍部長羅雅爾最近曾向眾議字撥款委員會報告，提及中國局勢。原詞今日發表，據稱，中國局勢使吾國在東方之問題更趨複雜。中國之原料供日本利用者益少，中國市場對日本制成品之銷路縮，此種情形將阻礙吾人致力之日本經濟復興。韓國局勢不穩亦增加遠東困難。在此種種情形之下，麥帥希望加派軍隊至遠東，但吾人無法切實增加遠東之駐軍。美國在日本，韓國與沖繩之佔領軍實力約為十三萬五千名。美軍士氣大抵甚旺。</p>
<h3>共情局惡意誹謗　南領袖嚴辭斥責</h3>
<p>〔路透社貝爾格勒九日電〕南總理狄托元帥今日向南斯拉夫人民陣線第三屆大會發表演說，聲明南斯拉夫不能追隨帝國主義者的足跡，南國正在建立社會主義，已獲有重大的成功。資本主義國家內的一切戰販及反動份子，若因南國今日所屬之地位以及東歐國家對南國之態度，而　對南斯拉夫從事揣測，實屬錯誤。就此點而論，南國之態度始終一貫不變。狄托談及共產情報局對南斯拉夫之抨擊時，表示此等攻擊愈烈，則南人革命的抵抗意志亦愈趨堅決。共產情報局的宣傳並不馬克斯化，不但有損社會主義方法的聲譽，甚至可對世界的革命發展，發生不堪設想的後果。</p>

<h3>路局自動調整運價　將自十三日起實行　若照核本計價辦法上漲約五倍餘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬區鐵路局將於本月十三日起，繼粵漢區鐵路局之後，自行調整運價（按粵漢路已於四月四日自動漲價），增漲程度現尚在作最後考慮中。據悉：若照立法院核本計價辦法計算，客運基本運價將為每公裏二〇八元三角七分，貨運每公裏二七七元八角五分，較現行運價約增五倍餘。</p>
<p>兩路此次自動調整運價，已為第二次，上次在兩路大罷工之後，因兩路員工薪律自此時後已改由食米市價折合，不得不提高運價，以維持收支平衡。嗣於二月間開始，實行公式化調整，其間雖迭次發生煤荒，路局尚能分批採購，或請央行墊款週轉，勉強維持，惟自四月份起立法院規定，鐵路運價按月調整，致使運價益無法追隨物價上漲，週來物價瘋狂上漲，路局收支相距越遠，自三月十一日迄今，煤價已上漲十二倍，米價上漲七倍，而兩路運價則漲二倍，以致每日行車用煤又無力採購，三月份員工薪津亦未澄清，該局長王兆槐，特於前日晉京向交部報告兩路現狀，及自動漲價之必要性。</p>
<h3>王兆槐發表談話　述處境困難情形</h3>
<p>王氏昨日返滬，向記者發表談話稱：「本路運價雖迭經調整，但與一般物價仍難比擬，最近四月一日調整一次，僅奉准增加一倍，原已不切事實，迄今未滿旬日，因物價益復狂漲，彼此距離更遠，尤以運輸成本最關主要之煤·米兩項，尤為劇烈。本局用煤每月至少需二萬一千噸，向由燃管會統籌，以外煤·開　煤·臺煤分批供給。外煤在三月十一日為九九，八六四元，迄今日（四月九日）為一，二七〇，八〇〇元，上漲達一二·七倍，開　煤三月十一日為九一，五四二元，迄至今日為六七一，五〇〇元，上漲達七·四倍，臺煤三月十一日八三，二二〇元，在今日為四一五，七二〇元，計上漲五倍。本局客貨運價，自三月十一日至今日，客運僅漲二倍，貨運僅漲二·四倍，本局待遇為維護員工生活，使鐵路暢通，由各鐵路秉承交通部命令，概以食米單位計算薪津，雖負擔較钜，而為使員工安心工作起見，自屬必需負擔，而白米價格三月十一日為三六，五〇〇元，至今日且叩三十萬大關，支出與收入之此例，其相差之懸殊，實可驚人，於不得已之中，一方面向中央銀行借煤濟急，另一方面向交通部請求貼補，但借煤歸還時須按付款日煤價結算，在貼補款未到前每日在營業收入項下撥付若幹，緩不濟急，已成永遠還不清之局面。如本局於三月十五日請求撥煤專款三十億，於三月二十一日批准十億，但該款遲至四月八日方由中央銀行撥付，在當時可購煤七，五六四噸，但收到時祇獲購一，〇八九噸。二月餘來，始而為安定員工生活與行　秩序而努力，繼而籌措黑白兩種食糧而煞費苦心，時至今日，本局員工薪津三月份尚有十分之四未發，燃煤用至本月十四日卽無以為繼，交通部貼補費四月份有七十億之多，但尚未撥到，俟撥到時還去舊欠需五十餘億，如時間過遲，恐尚不止此數，是則本局財政之困難，已瀕絕境。本人鑒於兩路交通之重要，自當以全部力量予以維持，然處境之困難如斯，至盼各方人士予以諒解也。」</p>

<h3>草原招魂！（上）　攝影家詹近水遺著日記　揭開了三果洛事件之謎</h3>
<p>— 蕭賽</p>
<p>「中原何處有淳風，遠古元看萬族同，千裏喬林行不斷，馬頭明鏡入蠶叢。」</p>
<p>（謝無量購詹近水西遊草地時）</p>
<p>自從一九四八年春三果洛士官康光明入獨，向省府請求劃明西川與青海省界之後，馬必傑便受在宣慰團的團長，製造成川邊問題的「三果洛事件」，遇害者的家屬在蓉力爭償還詹近水等人的血債。</p>
<p>三果洛在黃河流域，巴顏喀那山之南，吉士山腳下，為川西奧秘的草原，物產豐富，有稀罕的「鈾」存在，沙金遍河，風光壯麗，但都把持在士官，土佛之手，以為那是鎮山之寶，連雷諾也被誘惑去過。</p>
<p>由蓉出發　事情是這樣的：四月十號，參加慰團的攝影詹近水等由蓉動身，同行計有醫師廖宏道。莫昆祺，邊民指導所的劉世燦，由灌縣入松潘集合裝整待發，另增獸醫師王開元，通師數名，嗣派番兵數十人，高插「馬」字黃旗，荷槍運騎出黃勝關，漢官馬團長另備靠背椅，行軍床，收音機，禦廚，打算在大墨哇一帶番夷面前揚起漢威。</p>
<p>後來，經阿壩渡黃河，達目的地貢馬桑。</p>
<p>從詹近水的日記（僥倖被他那位虎口餘生的侄子帶回來了）去看「三果洛事件」，可窺全貌，和事件的真象。</p>
<p>「四月十六由灌出發，滑竿十六，浩蕩有如長蛇大陣，天小雨，進山已有寒意。十七過娘子嶺，十八日過飛沙關，十九日過索橋，盤查甚嚴，無通行證者禁行。越棋盤關·汶川一帶，山路崎嶇，城如鬥大，雞毛店林立，距城二十裏板橋關，為民廿四年李家鈺將軍領兵中共爭戰地，如今這川西戰場破瓦頹垣，荒草成林，二十日至茂州城。」</p>
<p>「次日與馬團長去專署，（詹近山是宣慰團的秘書兼寰球畫報攝影記者）拜訪何專員，談到去年他們考察團深入草地的經驗，以及他馬不停蹄與煙匪苦鬥；而這黑水區域裏，至今尚難澈底。」</p>
<p>近水這人頗為天真，他記著：「本人過去為一瘦子，現在已胖，可見旅行生活，亦有助於身心矣，」詎知後來遇害，人間萬事誠難逆料。</p>
<p>松潘鳴　　「二十二日離茂州宿溝頭寨，次日在苜蓿堡，過溜索，第三天爬坡，腳冷，寒署表損壞，難察度數，以成都的氣候言，像十一月的天氣，過水溝子。　溪，民二十一年秋，地震，曾把整個繁榮的　溪淹沒得一點不留，至今城磚尚留遺跡，教場壩沉後，惟一保存的是點將臺，臺後佛像高二丈，係唐代造像。沿途醫生及攝影大受士人歡迎，夜宿沙溝。」</p>
<p>「廿五日四山大雪，過　龍寺，宿鎮江關，這裏的人民生活在窮困中，山竿，黍麥，為主要糧食，趕緊潘城隍廟會的男婦番胞，都集中在這裏。」</p>
<p>「廿七日至松潘，城廟附近，大隊人馬槍炮齊鳴，歡迎馬團長的行列，已夠熱鬧。」</p>
<p>帳外鈴語　「五月廿九日大家都忙著要出發草地了，馬團長正像一個班主，連臺好戲要怎樣才能唱下去，省府撥發的經費，從松潘到三果洛用來搬運全班人馬，只消四天，就要淨光，看馬團長拿甚麼王牌出來？掏腰包來完成這偉大任務，大家都相信王主席一定在經費上要大大追加一下。牛馬都集中到縣銀行來，前隊浩蕩從北城出發，班主馬必傑仍在為張羅銀元作慌，松潘的水是硬的，以黑白起家的小商人要賬的威風，是夠班主受的。」</p>
<p>「隨金河壩遊向右轉灣，入船子溝，士官列隊送行，空穀裏傳出一串爆竹聲。六月一日山水跋　，出黃勝關，氣溫已降低至四十度，最後一次漢式牙祭，登騎，為了騎馬把袴襠撕破，是在我翻譯的不利家婆的平原上落寨了，晚上只得自已補袴襠。」</p>
<p>「北向哈馬範到哈雞範，一路黛黃花，觀音柳，滿山隨水生長，還有狗舌花，和四辦紅　等，遍問西番，已不知這裏地名了，苦煞繪圖的吳平章，康克明，鐵振西，都在這裏集中，二十幾個帳蓬，我想當年劉皇叔在遼營，也不過如此，帳外馬鈴迎風四響，我又想起唐明皇幸蜀夜雨聞鈴的故事。」</p>
<p>四日從折波那支（山腳意）過折波山，一進娘家坎，完全是草地的景象，水在下面，草在上面，牛馬一不小心，便落入泥淖，先行者盤旋找路，我的小驢落入泥塘，繩索施救，人馬深感吃力，八陣團雖說神奇，我想決沒有這草壩上走馬困難，夜宿墨　第一個牧場，這些地方那有郵政，只待松潘歸客雲耳。」</p>
<p>盆地落寨　「五日過來格山，下飯菜是鹽水湯，粢粑最壞，內有牛羊毛和草紙灰，使人難以下咽，這裏墨　族是無政府管束的地方，前者考察團來，沒有賣賬，還偷了馬和槍，七日過阿邱梗喀色耳鴉口河，八日至阿基工炕，三果洛古戰場地，鮮紅土上生長柏樹，土人有毀一枝者，相傳全家必死。」</p>
<h3>江陰要塞總隊長　吳廣文畏罪潛逃</h3>
<p>〔本報武進八日訊〕有月廿九日，有私運貨船十一艘，滿載火油汽油紙張等軍用貨物，潛由後　取道抵石頭港三甲裏，被當地要塞守備總隊士兵查獲，該守備總隊長吳廣文一時竟受愚弄，奸商許以黃金三十兩作賄賂買放路，當付金戒子金塊等計六兩重金子。餘悉以棉紗多件作抵贖。吳廣文默許放行，十一艘貨船當夜潛出港口他去，旋事為要塞司令戴戎光得密報偵悉。戴一面將吳廣文交付監視。同時金子棉紗等贓物搜出。六日江蘇省公署暨第一綏區合組軍政督察團到澄。丁兼司令亦蒞澄視察江防，戴司令卽將全案移送督察團審訊。督察團糾察組正著手審問間，該吳廣文突然潛逃無跡。現糾察組責成戴司令將該犯緝獲歸案，以便法辦。</p>
<h3>南潯：無聲的鄉村（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>絲業低落　南潯絲業衰落的原因，就是在不求改進，當時美國觀光團來時，竟沒有絲廠，美人大奇，後來才知道各自繅製土絲，繅製土絲，不能使之標準化，密度個體都不勻淨，當不合理想，當地有絲業界前輩商談會張理事長告記者說：「南潯絲業衰落的原因，是因為蠶的原種失傳，照日本的方法，原種由國家保存，交雜種則由民間濫觴，如我們不保存原種，盡以改良種養育，則改良種由外國而來，外國知中國為可畏的競爭者，自然沒有好種給我們。此外因為農胞售　，為求成本之外多賺些錢，所以不待「寶實」吐絲完盡，卽把繭子下山，以求份量加重」。是的，記者也曾遇到政府貨款的繭行與絲廠故意抑低繭價收繭的例子，因此我們為獎勵育好蠶繅好絲，應該寬給價格，不要繭賤病農繼而病絲。</p>
<p>溫厚水鄉　記者到南潯去考察是在本年三月下旬，南潯戰前人口有三萬五千人，現僅一萬八千人，高大門戶，毀於災火者大半，當地有南潯中學一所，小學十五所，育嬰堂一所，公立醫院一所，中學校和工林黎元，年青幹練，校中教務主任，聘作家徐遲擔任，他們兩們為記者道：「南潯的商辦鹽運實際是官僚資本，現在官銷官運，當已沒落。典當業是剝削貧民的，現已日漸西沉，只有蠶絲還可以改良進步，再在國際舞臺上爭取光榮」。我告徐遲兄說：「南潯的環境很好，是文物溫厚的水鄉，尤其蠶絲馳譽國際間，頂好在學校中加入蠶桑研究一門，以配合南潯絲的改良」。他說他最愛他的家鄉，那私有恬靜安適，家鄉也只有向蠶絲一業去奮鬥。我們數人曾去小運莊一遊，那裏亭樓的窗欞欄檻，多已殘敗，不過在這整個的佈置看來，也可看出當年的豪華盛景，鄰接小運莊為劉家的藏書樓，我們也去參觀，那裏藏書的地方經已封鎖，恐懼歹人偷盜所致，據說內藏書卷十萬餘冊，有永樂大典一書，全國僅二十四本，而此樓即藏有十八本，昔年浙省圖書館卽來此手抄者。藏書屋樓之外，佈置有亭園花木，環境清幽，正是大好養性讀書之處。</p>
<p>回鄉苦幹　據林黎元兄告我：「現在南潯有錢的人，多半因為不忍看見空鄉的殘破，所以都到上海，香港等地去了，但要復興地方，建設家鄉，使蠶絲重新馳譽國外，必須大家回來，埋頭苦幹」。</p>
<p>又據他告訴記者「當年最富建設精神的張靜江先生現在紐約養　，眼睛已經失明了，原有回國之想，後因時局不靖，所以也沒有打算回來」。</p>
<p>是的，南潯過去有他的歷史地位，現在顯得凋零殘落，無聲寂寞了，「無聲寂寞是不能忍耐的」，我們要振起精神，衝破這寂寞，使南潯重新恢復繁盛！</p>
<p>來函　頃據本報讀者工程師薛厚生君來函稱：本報記者黃行天君記述「浙江的寶藏　石礦」一文中，關於氟石礦產量總額的百分之八十二作為煉鐵溶劑的一點，略有補充，渠謂　石又名螢石，（原名Tlourite，或稱Tlourspar，）其主要用途為冶	金，（如鋼·銻·鉛·鋁·鐵　·鐵錳·銅·金銀等）但佔產量總額的百分之八十二者應為煉鋁熔劑，我國現在需要最毀切者首推臺灣鋁業股分有限公司，亟為刊正如上。</p>

<h3>南昌情殺慘劇　苦讀女學生吳綺雲　在火利刃下殞命　凶手洪敏被捕後直談殺機</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌六日航訊〕南昌市城北住宅區下沙窩嚴公廟河畔，最近演出了一幕情殺案，案中的女主角為苦學生吳綺雲。凶手洪敏，在案情發覺後，被警局拘捕，將謀殺經過，毫無掩飾地，盡情吐露。</p>
<p>女主角吳綺雲，芳年廿四，浙江金華人，她生成一付清麗的容貌，輕盈的體態，曾卒業於南昌女子學校。</p>
<p>她是可憐失怙的孩子，在十歲時，他父親遺下了她和一個母親而逝世，居於本市。當日軍侵及南昌時，由其母攜同避居清江，其後又遷住泰和，斯時物價高漲，生活迫人，吳女乃為人抄寫，博蠅頭微利，藉以侍奉母親。其後，泰和又告吃緊，母女倆相依為命，逃至距離吉安不到一天路程的吉水暫住。</p>
<p>逃難在吉水時，遇鄢樹仁其人，鄢竟以老母弱女可欺，迭施鬼伎，向吳女大獻殷勤，以介紹工作為詞，誘女到吉安鄉間，圖作藏嬌之計，吳女機警，乘機深夜落荒，奔逃回家，幸未陷入鄢某的圈套。及至勝利歸來，重回南昌，卽考入某女校為免費生，朝夕苦讀，幸告有成。</p>
<p>吳女近在校功課，一日突在街頭與前在泰和相識之青年洪敏相值，竟致情苗暗種，頗有論婚之意，但隔日子，變故突生，洪敏因風聞吳女別有所戀，對她漸起疑　，卒告疎遠，吳女固不知洪郎有異，全不加以戒備，孰知洪竟以鐘情吳女而殺機暗萌了。</p>
<p>上月卅一日傍晚，洪約吳外出，至「大世界」往觀影片「玫瑰飄零」，吳女欣然偕往，迨至頭場散後，兩人卽雙雙散步，邊行邊談，倍覺親勢，後又至城北公園娓娓情談，吳女始終不知洪之心懷殺意。及至下沙窩嚴公廟附近江邊時，洪突向吳出以利刀，向吳腹部頭部猛戳，遂致香消玉殞。</p>
<p>吳女倒斃於利刃之下同，仰臥江畔，於次晨始被發覺，此一幕情殺案，便傳遍了洪都。死者燙髮，右額有紅髮夾一個，上身著青地藍花短襖，外罩短大衣，下著青西裝褲，肉色絲襪，黃皮鞋，遍身泥土血痕，肚中一刀，長約三寸，右額一刀，長約寸許，雙手緊握，蓋死前似曾經有強烈之掙扎。</p>
<p>案發後，警員四出緝凶，在女母處獲得線索，卒在火車南站將凶犯洪敏緝獲。他已將案情與謀殺經過，和盤供出，這不隱瞞，至如何發落，則尚有待於當局的研審。</p>

<h3>食米恢復自由買賣　粳秈緊叩三十萬關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食米交易，昨起取消限價，恢復自由賣買，市場交易恢復，但由於到貨奇缺，銷路奇暢，加之金鈔狂升，故價暴升。白粳卽期款二十七萬五千，高貨二十九萬，下週一款須三十四萬。薄稻卽期款二十八萬，下週一款三十四萬，早稻三十二萬，各猛漲五成。二市到貨共計三〇八九石。</p>
<p>又訊：關於最近食米價格瘋狂上漲一事，社會局負責人昨稱：近來金鈔各物均皆狂漲，如單獨壓抑米價，為不智之舉，社局所注意者：（一）使食米不致成為投機對象；（二）使市場不以糧食為籌碼。本市所需食糧三分之二，已由戶口米供應，仰賴於市場者僅三分之一，如糧食能作合理疏導，本市決不致發生糧荒。本市刻正準備存儲四·五·六·七·八共五個月之食糧，四月份業已籌足，其餘數月存糧正在籌集中。</p>

<h3>銀元猛晉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元套匯，因各地價格脫節甚大，市況混亂，交易轉稀。漢口，汕頭，重慶，萬縣等地，均有數十萬元套出，馬路交易先平後緊。</p>

<h3>紗價狂跳三成　棉布猛烈升騰</h3>
<p>紗市交易異常活躍，趨勢進入瘋狂狀態，人心一致向上，買戶爭相搜購，各方均以持貨為原則，結果狂跳三成以上。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳自一七〇〇萬元開出一度叩二〇〇〇萬元大關，午收為一九五〇萬元，較前激挺五五〇萬元之钜。他若金城與寶光等，俱逼近二〇〇〇萬大關。三二支銀月猛升四〇〇萬元，以一三〇〇萬元結束。</p>

<h3>美黃金運滬說　未·能·證·實</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨報載：國有自美空運大批黃金抵滬一訊，記者昨向該行業務局長證實，林氏答稱：「對此訊未便有所表示。記者復詢以金業市場是否將予擴充改組，林氏亦答稱：」對此訊迄亦未有所聞。</p>
<h3>市場散步</h3>
<p>看臺客</p>
<p>漲風全面燦爛　套做法門多端</p>
<p>昨各市場，漲風全面展開。</p>
<p>黃金美鈔漲率平平，一般商品都急激狂舁，豆油·米粉等一馬當先。木材·五金·棉紗·狂漲尤勁。肥皂·擲煙·漲度，超過本來歷來空前記錄。各處一片熱烈狂漲聲，記著我們昨天的話。</p>
<p>近年來，一般生意中人，十個裏有九個，都是在金鈔股票及商品之間套來套去的套。和現在略有不同的套法，過去，在時間上沒有什麼常規；看風使舵·現在呢，無形中已有程序表，在不斷反復著。</p>
<p>把這程序表列出來，可以列舉幾個例子。如把每個月，分甲乙丙丁四週，順次而下。於是有銀元和拆息的套做，金鈔和本廠出品的套做，原料和本廠股票的套做。</p>
<p>先舉銀元和拆息的套做：</p>
<p>甲丙兩週，出銀元放拆息，乙丁兩週，收回印子錢進銀元。現在正在乙週內，銀元大跳特跳，這種人的套做，很有關係。</p>
<p>再舉金鈔和本廠出品的套做，這是籌發職工薪資，調撥頭寸的做法。</p>
<p>甲丙兩週，進金鈔，乙丁兩週出三廠出品。因為甲丙兩週進金鈔的原故，於是拋出本廠出品，籌備薪資頭寸。</p>
<p>這種套做，有個奧妙。試分三點說明：</p>
<p>（一）因為甲丙兩週進金鈔，金鈔漲勢甚盛；助長了乙丁兩週的商品市場的漲勢了。</p>
<p>（二）乙丁兩週哄高物價，便可趁高拋售本廠出品了。但一般物價的高漲，卻也增大了本期生活費指數，頗有自扳石頭自壓腳的苦。</p>
<p>（三）為了抵消自扳石頭自壓腳的苦，所以甲丙兩週進的金鈔，卽在彌補此方面損失，同時也好在甲丙兩週中補原料也。</p>
<p>再舉原料和本廠股票的套做，這是和金鈔及本廠出品套做之間相調劑的方法；可以說是套做中的套做。</p>
<p>大體上是：</p>
<p>（一）甲丙兩週套進金鈔，套出本廠股票。</p>
<p>（二）乙丙兩週，套出本廠出品，套進原料。</p>
<p>（三）甲丙兩週套出本廠出品，套進本廠股票。</p>
<p>（四）乙丁兩週套出本廠股票，套進原料。</p>
<p>個中變化，視局勢而定。但是有一個重要特點，金鈔及本廠股票是放在對立的兩種地位上，隨機應變地處理著。</p>
<p>本廠出品和本廠股票，則放在相輔或又相尅的地位，而處理著。所謂進原料，倒是放在他人資本的利用上，列進套做交易裏，僅在時間上的安排罷了。</p>
<p>然而，如此這般套做，以「國泰民安」的前提。當前，睏一覺，環境會有若何變化，誰都難說。所以長線短線，又須善於調度，好自為之了。</p>
<p>環境如何變化　須要火燭小心</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕甲組足球聯賽第二循環戰鐵路對精武，昨日下午三時半在逸園，在一面倒之形勢下，鐵路以四比一大勝精武，上半時鐵路運中三元，精武未開紀錄。球迷與緻不佳，到者不滿二千人。</p>
<p>精武小將作戰雖勇猛努力，無奈輕騐不足，技術尚差，攻門機會失落，後衛軟弱空盧，尤為大病，上半時鐵路勝來輕而易興，十五分鐘內刀劈三關。下半時攻勢稍見緩和，又中一雙成四比零。直至最後數分鐘精武才罰中一隻十二磚球，打破鴨蛋，四比一終局。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市體育館昨晚有籃球聯賽甲二組三場：（一）浦水勝崇德八十一比三十四。（二）郵電勝無名，四十五比四十一。（三）海豚勝紅騎，七十比卅二。</p>
<p>第一場為甲D賽浦水對崇德，浦水胡得時孫威熙等投擲瘋狂，有若探襄取物，上半時四十三比十三。下半時崇德許心耕聶光禹等亦以牙還牙，形勢尚不寂莫，結果浦水仍以八十一比三十四勝。</p>
<p>第二場甲B組郵電對無名，無名上半時罰球機會極多，以廿一比十七佔先。下半時觸開始，郵電李方膺王春一連兩球，頓成廿一平手，從此否極泰來，保持領前姿態，結果郵電四十五比四十一，最後勝利。</p>
<p>末場甲二D豚戰紅騎，開賽後海豚連中三元，紅騎膛目，行動不靈，上半時卅一比十。下半時海豚歐陽廣治獲分最多，終場海豚七十，紅騎卅二。</p>
<h3>無錫籃球熱　郵電獨覇一方</h3>
<p>〔無錫訊〕本邑盟主郵電籃球隊，係集當地郵電同人所組織，在隊長王春元領導之下，擁有名將高保生，唐民生，及全運會江蘇代表吳錦文蔣國平李方膺戴堯章等，實力堅強，雄視京滬。前為觀摩球藝及提液後進起見，特不辭艱辛毅然參加上海四屆聯賽，但自參戰以來，戰績雖勝負參半，終因該隊球員對於室內地板及燈光下比賽根本不感習慣，故各員演出不但格格不入，且呆板異極，平均未能達到平日一半水凖，惟該隊經數戰經騐後，對於戰略上應用見識，頗多獲益，一季之後對於室內及燈光下球驅將有飛躍的進度，並聞國手吳成章現由跳王張嘉藝之介紹，業已概允擔任該隊提導，故該隊嗣後援定每逢假期經常來滬友賽，以資借鏡，如假以時日該隊前途未可限量也。</p>
<p>值此風和日暖，大好春光，最適宜室外運動，本邑沉寂已外之公園籃球場近來日趨熱鬧，日前郵電隊為了操練球藝，特與江南大學隊在該場作友誼比賽，觀衆擠得水洩不通，為數當在三千人以上，情況熱烈，是賽最電大將高保生蔣國平雖未出場，但搭配仍極整齊，全隊夠氣夠力，合作默契，比賽結果郵電以壓倒之勢大破江南水學隊，比數為四十四比廿四。</p>
<p>常州藍白籃球隊，為當地售流勁旅，以體力充沛，連絡純熟，射籃准確見長，該隊乘春假之便，特專程遠征來錫，本月六日下午四時首由郵電隊應戰，是役公園球場偌大看台擠得滿坑滿谷，四時正開賽，由裁判陳鶴芳執決，郵電一路領先，勢如風捲殘葉，上半時十八比四。易邊後，郵電攻勢銳不可當，但客軍雖敗，奮鬥精神則始終不懈，故比賽本差雖極縣殊，而全賽絕少「冷場」,固不失為精彩比賽,總結果卅九比十二,客軍鍛羽。</p>
<p>七日下午三時起，郵電首戰強旅「綠隊」，終因郵電棋高一着，在輕描淡寫中，以五八比卅四擊敗綠隊。次場客軍藍白隊再戰本邑藍鷹隊，雙方競爭頗烈，上半時十三比十一，客軍佔先，下半時開始，客軍奮勇有為，結果卅五比廿，客軍初奏凱歌。</p>

<h3>鐵路精武戰後評述</h3>
<p>日得鐵路精武之戰，賽前一致預測鐵路可勝，但粗武小將富有朝氣，其戰　力亦自不可侮，初循賽時，曾迫和青白，但缺點在經騐不足，演出有時好得非凡，有時則大失常態，假使狀態正常，以後不難成為一支鐵軍。昨賽甫經接觸，精武小將頗為上路，但上半時三球一失，就此軍心渙散，提不起勁了。第一球陸慶祥頭頂入網，係郁琪黃立甫疏於防範，陳惠民太喜衝出，留下空門一座，第二球由於黃立甫在禁區過事盤弄，致為林典義搶去傳中，瞿錫根乘虛而入，第三球與以上二球，如同一轍，均因精武本身造成錯誤，鐵路諸鋒遂得伺隙進攻，造成戰果，衹有第四球，林典義傳中，蕭子文頂向球門左方，為全賽最美觀之一鏡頭。</p>
<p>據說精武諸將大都甫經參加田徑賽後，筋疲力盡，因之影響作戰精神，中堅郁琪，精武倚之為金城湯池，他是大夏大學田徑主將，趕來出戰，因渠顯出疲態，全隊戰　情緒，亦因之隆低，門將陳惠民仍嫌心神不定，心猿意馬，還是高致文較好，黃立甫太喜盤弄，為內衛大忌，陳志剛日有進境，兩翼方紉秋范本鈞均有威脅力量，方紉秋右足切射，雖然未破敵門，亦足使廖雄喪膽，中鋒吳敬仁遇到國脚高保正，迫得英雄無用武之地，衹有望門興吧而已。</p>
<p>鐵路作戰瞿錫根特別卯上，獨中二球，難能呆貴，雖然面部被撞得臉青目腫，但留下光榮的一頁，以後回憶起來，也自有味。高保正坐鎮中央，精武小將望而却步，陸炳生彪悍善　，前後廝殺，當者披靡，曹禮明努力不倦，鐵路之所以能給終保持優勢，中衛綫均特別堅強，難分軒輊，由此可以見得中衛綫得力，容易攻破對方防綫，獲取勝利，其重要性實不容忽視。門守廖雄身手矯健屢救險球，吳嘉邦改在任內衞，亦楚楚可觀，岳仁孝勇風依舊，有聲有色。前鋒綫上仍以蕭陸張三劍客最為出色，張傑之竄射，有韓龍漲風味，蕭子文開路覓隙，陸慶祥穿針引綫，在在發揮中間三鋒之威力。林典義善自藏拙，有球總是輸送中央，不作切入企圖，遇到對方中堅郁琪疲兵再戰，遏制不住中央突破攻勢，因之特别顯得有用。费春林不惯任翼鋒，所以數度在門前，千鈞一髪之際。反而一脚野球，不知去向，但以其身材速度及脚頭，可以勝任翼鋒，以後如專練任翼，或能有所成就也。（球史公）</p>

<h3>官樣文章</h3>
<p>— 曲辰</p>
<p>好久沒有出門，前幾天為了家鄉有些事，所以才光顧到北站，進站看到了兩張公吿，我覺得是很够尋味的。</p>
<p>在北站大門口的一張，是京滬綫警務處的招領公吿，約略地記錄在下面：「茲拾獲金圓券約一千元，失主可用書面開明遺失地點，時間以及確數，具保後向本處領取」。後面的日期是三十八年三月，幾日沒有塡明。我們姑且不管，僅從三月這一點上看來，到現在也該有好多日子了。我在想：如果這一張公吿是在三月初公布的話，則一千左右的金圓券，化上這一套的具領手續，還不至於會如何的虧本；然而假使在三月下旬的話，那末警務處也未免太小題大做了。區區的一千金圓又算得了什麼，何苦貼上了偌大的公吿，又須化上這樣複雜的手續去具領，我相信卽使失主眞的見到了它，也斷不會優到如此地步的。或許相反地，會作上一個會心的微笑，表示他的歉意，辜負了警務處的一片好意了。</p>
<p>另一張是旅客購票需憑種痘證的公吿，我一看後，不禁替自己慶幸，因為恰巧在幾天前我種過了痘，這一套手續還不至會臨時侷促。可是當我將種痘證及票價一併送進窗口的時候，萬不防裏面的先生會不屑一顧地丟了出來。我注意到旁的旅客，原來他們全沒有這一套，照樣買得了車票。我始恍然大悟，難怪外面的種痘站這樣的空閒着。我覺得自己有些　，而且太不知趣了。</p>
<p>兩張公吿，深深地印入了我的腦際。我也這樣想過：與其說是公吿，還不如乾脆說是北站的點綴品。然而我又有些不敢，因為這究竟是官塲的公吿呀。</p>
<h3>最好的餅</h3>
<p>— 金大勤譯</p>
<p>當我還是「個孩子的時候我們家裏常常窮得一點食物也沒有。不過我們仍過得很快活，因為母親總帶着深信的樣子，吿訴我們說，明天一定可以吃得很好的。</p>
<p>一年冬天，父觀長時期地在外工作，母親在一家紡織廠裏做工。她做的是夜班，所以白天還可以做些一家事。每天傍晚，當她到工廠裏去上工時，她總要留下一張條子，吿訴我們家裏有些什麼食物，我們又該怎樣處理它。</p>
<p>那時瑪麗（我的姊姊）已在初級中學畢業，進了家電話公司做事；我在放學後也到一家運輸公司去做幾小時，哥哥梯特也在那兒做的。只有小弟弟喬治還常在家。我們常覺得我們的家太支離破碎了，兄弟姊妹們難得有機會碰頭。只有星期天，母親才重把這一家人牽攏在一起。</p>
<p>這天，母親留下的條子上寫着：「在橱裏有四個鷄蛋，你們可以每人吃一個。明天是我的生日，我們將要好好慶祝一下」。</p>
<p>喬治第一個看到這張條子，我和梯特回來時他已睡了。他在條子上寫着：「我的蛋給瑪麗吃吧，我不餓。」</p>
<p>我和梯特互相望望。梯特終於說：「我也不覺得餓」。「總而言之，給瑪麗吃吧，——對！」他把這句子寫在喬治寫的後面，但沒有寫完。於是，我也寫：「我也不餓」。</p>
<p>瑪麗回來時我們都已睡了。第二天早晨，母親的臉色非常難看，總手裏拿着那張紙條。「我記得，我是叫你們每人吃一個的」。</p>
<p>我們都不作聲。母親轉向剛從門外進來的瑪麗：「我很驚異，你竟吃了所有的蛋！我眞傷心，你竟是這樣自私！」</p>
<p>瑪麗垂下了頭。母親還在苛刻地說：「是不是你弄掉了所有的蛋？是不是？櫉裏的蛋全沒有了！」</p>
<p>瑪麗點點頭。</p>
<p>母親嘆息了。「不過，我們至少有一頓豐盛的早餐可吃，我回家時已吩咐一家伙食店送些食物來」。她匆忙地到廚房裏去了</p>
<p>不一會母親又回出來，手裏拿着一個非常漂亮的餅子。「這是什麼？」她迷惑地問。</p>
<p>「這是一個餅，母親」，　麗抬起頭來。「這是我昨晚回來後做的，弄掉了四個蛋。因為，今天是母親的生日」。</p>
<p>母親的眼淚掉下來了，用手臂抱住瑪麗。「孩子，上帝保佑你！」</p>
<p>我們愉快地吃着這個餅，雖然這餅十小，而且烘得不怎麼適當，可是我們覺得，這是我們一生中所吃到過的最好的餅。</p>

<h3>談免戰牌</h3>
<p>— 張契渠</p>
<p>人生不如意事常八九，想聽和談消息聽不到，不想聽砲聲，砲聲却在北岸越打越響了。在十分煩悶中，不禁使我想起了舊小說中的廝殺規矩來。</p>
<p>在舊小說中，雙方交戰，當戰役發生之前，甲方循例須先送達「挑戰書」。乙方倘使無意應戰，便可將「免戰牌」高高褂起，甲方卽須按兵不動。我想，我們何妨也學一學前輩古人，製一塊「免戰牌」，懸掛在揚子江心，以期先和後談，豈不很好嗎？</p>
<p>記得抗戰之初，有一位當軍需的朋友吿訴我，一顆步槍子彈，當時要値四角錢。一顆平射砲彈，要二十五塊大洋。一顆加農砲彈，需一百二十多元。以此推想，一枚五百磅的炸彈應値多少？一艘九千噸的巡洋艦迭價幾許？在大頭過五萬，小頭四萬多的今日，一槍一彈的消費，折合金圓券，又該多少？而一次小小的戰役的發動，旣決不是一槍一彈一所能了事，那麼在「砲火熾烈二的情况下，試想該有多少顆四角一」，，多少顆「二十五元」與「一百一二十元」在砰砰聲中化為烏有？這在深受經濟壓迫的我看來，能一不覺得太可惜嗎？一</p>
<p>或人說：子彈的消耗雖大，但，倘因此而使革命成功，它的代價有千百倍於子彈的損失者。權衡輕重，這一點消耗也就算不得什麼了。</p>
<p>我說：不然。砲火雖猛，事實上打中人的並不多。機槍軋軋，砲聲隆隆，如果每一槍每一彈都能命中，抗戰至今，中國人早就死剩不多幾個了。可惜的是把這些値錢的子彈，大部份浪費在荒田中·河灘邊·樹林裏·山脚下，毫無作用。至若那小部份命中的子彈，那是更糟了。試想，那些被殺傷的「人海」構成份子，誰無父母，心肝寳貝兒的喂養到這樣大。而今平白犧牲，旣費子彈，又費生命，雙重損失，一無所得，豈不更可痛惜？</p>
<p>何况和談雖然秘密，事實確已開始。如果談成，不用說，將來總有個分曉，這時也不必零星犧牲。事實上：無論國軍。共軍，都是黃膚黑髮的中國「人民」；無論子彈·砲彈，也都是老百姓的汗血脂膏。在和不成的時候，老百姓園無力制止戰爭；但現在，雙方已在談起來了，則我們老百姓，難道不能勸勸雙方，在揚子江中放下刀槍，先吿息爭嗎？</p>

<h3>艦長管家記</h3>
<p>— 東方荆</p>
<p>一位艦長夫人到軍艦上去參觀，看見在上午十時左右，艦上已收拾得乾乾凈凈，離早餐後僅兩小時。一見之下，不禁大為騖異水手們做事的迅速。</p>
<p>艦長吿訴她說：在軍艦上燒飯，打掃和洗衣，也和工程與砲術一樣，經過精密的研究，並由專家們設計出方法和步驟·</p>
<p>隔了若干時，這位艦長調部服務。數日後，他太太因脚踝受傷，，住進醫院去。於是他自已操理家事，依照海軍的方法來治理家務。</p>
<p>為了科學地計劃家務，這位艦畏統計他的鄰居們每日耗在家務上的時間。十一位主婦中，每星期費在各項家務的平均時間如下：燒飯，十一小時十二分；打掃，十四小時；燙衣服，六小時；洗碗碟，八小時十分；洗衣（用機器），四十五分鐘；購物，三小時。</p>
<p>這就是說，平均每天要費六小時以上。照海軍的標準來說，這所費的時問，是太多了一點。按照海軍的方法，他須每天花三小時來處理這些家務。</p>
<p>於是他如此分配：</p>
<p>每天上午六至八時：洗衣，燙衣，預備早餐，同時弄好中餐及晚餐。打掃屋子，吃早餐，換衣服。每天早晨，把一間屋子打掃得特別乾凈，其他幾間就隨便打描一下。</p>
<p>八時半，他急急地趕往海軍部去辦公。晚上回家，就熱一下早晨已燒好的晚餐（這個緊急方法，一般主婦都未採用），碗盤洗好，廚房收拾好。再花半小時的功夫，做一個「一天計劃」，訂好明天做些什麼家事，什麼時候做，怎樣做法。這種制度是海軍效率的靈魂。八點鐘一切完畢，這位艦長開始休息。</p>
<p>打掃工作如分開來做，也可以變得輕鬆。例如每天擦一兩扇窗子，每星期一和星期五洗浴室的地板，若是每個家庭都各別制定出計劃，就一定可以减少家庭操作的時間。</p>
<p>雖然，這事情發生在美國，他們有機器可以分勞，然而這方法與精神，却也可供我們參考。現在一般家庭主婦，都感到僱傭人的煩惱時，到了必須自己操作一切家務時，如能走捷徑，如能先訂立計劃，把兩種工作來同時進行，並利用大小人力，丈夫。孩子都參加一部份家務操作，則也未嘗不可使家庭的勞役，變成有趣一點的工作吧。</p>

<h3>Mao Zedong's Reply Telegram to Acting President Li, Clarifying Standards for Peace Negotiations, Expressing Wish for Early Agreement to End War and Restore Peace, Premier He States Government is Currently Considering</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Communist Radio last night at 10:00 PM broadcast the exchange of telegrams between Li Zongren and Mao Zedong. This is the first time the Communists have released news regarding peace negotiations since the government's peace delegation went to Peiping on April 1st for peace talks. The broadcast first relayed the full text of Acting President Li's telegram to Mao Zedong from Nanking, followed by: "Xinhua News Agency Commentary: Li Zongren's telegram still contains many self-aggrandizing tones, boasting about his own influence, which is quite amusing. The so-called 'Kuomintang-Communist cooperation' is nowhere to be seen, which makes people feel uneasy. But fundamentally speaking, under the supervision of the people of the whole country, Li Zongren seems to have increased some sincerity in hoping for the success of peace. Whether this is the case, we shall see in the future." Afterwards, Mao Zedong's reply telegram to Li Zongren was released. The original text is as follows: "To Mr. Li Delin of Nanjing: I have received your telegram of the seventh (April). The Chinese Communist Party's position on the current situation is fully expressed in the statement of January 14th this year. Since your side agrees to take the eight conditions as the basis for negotiations, then it is not difficult to obtain a correct solution by seeking concrete realization based on these eight principles. The issue of war criminals is also the same. The standard is whether it is conducive to the advancement of the Chinese people's liberation cause and whether it is conducive to resolving domestic problems through peaceful means. Under this standard, we are prepared to adopt a lenient policy. When I met with Mr. Zhang Wenbai (Zizhong) today, I told him this. For the liberation of the Chinese people and the independence of the Chinese nation, for an early end to the war and restoration of peace, so as to facilitate the great work of starting production and construction on a nationwide scale, and to enable the country and the people to steadily enter a state of prosperity and happiness, it is urgent for both of us to establish a peace agreement as soon as possible. The Chinese Communist Party is very willing to join hands with all patriotic elements in the country and strive for this great goal. Mao Zedong, April 8, 1949."</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanking, 9th] After Mao Zedong's reply telegram to Acting President Li was broadcast by the Communists at 7:00 PM on the 9th, Acting President Li read the full text at 10:00 PM and expressed great satisfaction.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 9th] After Xinhua News Agency broadcast the news of the Communist Mao Zedong's reply telegram to Acting President Li on the 8th, Premier of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin, when asked by the press on the evening of the 9th about his feelings on the reply telegram, said: "It is still under careful consideration."</p>
<h3>Frequent Meetings in the Capital, More Personnel to be Sent to Peiping, With Zhang Qun and Yu Youren as Most Likely Candidates</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanking Dispatch, 9th] In order to promote the rapid success of the peace talks, the government may continue to send high-ranking officials to Peiping to assist the peace work from the side. It has been learned that the candidates and the number of people for this position were initially mentioned in the important consultations at the Acting President's official residence on the afternoon of the 9th. However, the opinions of each individual still need to be formally solicited separately on the 10th. It is said that the number of people is two, with Yu Youren and Zhang Qun being the most likely candidates. Tong Guanxian and Ju Zheng are also candidates under consideration and whose opinions will be solicited. As for the speculation that the Acting President will go in person, sources close to the President stated: This is not possible.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanking, 9th] High-ranking officials are gathering in the capital, and meetings are frequent, indicating that the overall situation will have new developments in a day or two. Related sources revealed on the evening of the 9th that what government officials are most concerned about at present is not only the situation of the peace talks in Peiping, but also the attitude of Guangzhou towards the peace talks. Zhang Qun returned from Xikou, and the opinions he brought back are also being given special attention. Although the Central Standing Committee held in Guangzhou agreed to establish a Peace Negotiation Steering Committee in Nanking, it is still questionable whether the committee has the power of final decision. In view of this situation, Acting President Li urgently summoned high-ranking officials in various places to return to Nanking. He Yingqin and Bai Chongxi arrived in Nanking on the 8th and immediately participated in the gathering at the Acting President's official residence. On the morning of the 9th, Yu Youren, who was in Shanghai, was invited to return to Nanking in a hurry. Zhang Qun, who went to Xikou to seek instructions, also rushed over at noon on the 9th. On the 9th, Acting President Li had individual talks with various high-ranking officials in the morning and afternoon. At 3:00 PM, he convened important consultations with high-ranking officials in Nanking. He Yingqin reported on the trip to Guangzhou on the spot, particularly emphasizing the resolution of the Central Standing Committee, the attitude of high-ranking officials in Guangzhou, and the general situation in Guangzhou. Zhang Qun reported on the situation of his trip to Xikou, and then discussed the peace talks and related issues for a long time. The content is unknown. Those who attended the meeting refused to disclose any information, but the content of the meeting was indeed very important. In addition to He's report, the Acting President also discussed the peace talks in detail, and Xu Yongchang and Gu Zhutong gave detailed reports on the Jiang Defense. It is said that the meeting was mainly studying Zhang Zhizhong's report in recent days. Those who attended the meeting included Yu Youren, He Yingqin, Tong Guanxian, Ju Zheng, Wu Zhongxin, Zhang Qun, Zhu Jiahua, Bai Chongxi, Xu Yongchang, and more than a dozen others.</p>
<h3>One of the Three Mysterious Guests, Liu Ziheng, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanking, 9th] The three mysterious guests from Peiping who once aroused the interest of political figures in the capital have been identified by reporters after days of interviews. Their names are Liu Ziheng, Li Minxin, and Zhu Yunshan. Li and Zhu were both listed in the statement on the current situation issued by Li Jishen and 55 others on January 22. They have added great mystery due to various objective conditions. However, after the reporter learned their names, everything became clear. Moreover, Liu Ziheng, the most mysterious of the three guests, took the Nanking-Shanghai night train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM on the 9th. According to Liu, before his departure, he told reporters that this trip was "visiting friends" and would return to Nanking after staying in Shanghai for one day. According to the English broadcast of the Communist Radio on the evening of the 9th, Li Jishen will be the mediator for any comprehensive peace talks.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Reporting on the Progress of Peace Talks in Peiping, Zhang Zhizhong Replies to Reporters in Nanking and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanking, 9th] The peace talks being held in Peiping are the focus of attention across the country, but because the Communists have declined reporters' requests to go and cover the event, and there are no news reports or broadcasts, little is known about the progress of the peace talks. Reporters in Nanking and Shanghai have, through the government delegation, requested the Communist representatives to provide news for daily publication, to be telegraphed to Nanking for announcement. It has now been learned that Zhang Zhizhong has replied by telegram to Nanking, stating that "there are many difficulties," so in the short term, there will be no direct reporting on the progress of the peace talks.</p>
<h3>The Communists Criticize Zhang Yaoming</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] In last night's Communist Radio broadcast, the Nanjing April 1st incident was used to vehemently criticize Zhang Yaoming, the commander of the capital garrison, pointing to Zhang as the direct person responsible for this bloodbath, and saying that he was slaughtering students under the instructions of President Chiang. It also pointed out that the recent statement issued by the Garrison Command was "utter nonsense, creating slander, and should be punished with an even heavier crime." Finally, it stated that if Zhang Yaoming did not immediately "redeem his sins by meritorious service," the new Communist troops would cross the Yangtze River and advance south, and would "execute the will of the people" and punish Zhang. In addition, it also claimed that Chiang's "reactionary clique" continued to persecute students in Nanking, Taiwan, Wuhan, Fuzhou, Chengdu, and other places, prohibiting parades and demonstrations. Students are still being threatened with slaughter. At the same time, it was also said that Xinhua News Agency reporters had interviewed democratic figures in Peiping, who expressed serious protests against this incident. Li Jishen stated: "This incident has made the people of the whole country greatly doubt the Nanjing reactionary government's sincerity in seeking peace. If some figures in the Nanjing reactionary government really hope for peace, they should immediately and completely break away from the Chiang Kai-shek clique, severely punish the murderers of the people, release all political prisoners, and side with the people." Shen Junru of the China Democratic League stated: The Nanjing April 1st incident proves that the government lacks sincerity in peace talks.</p>
<h3>Three Reporters in Anqing Injured While Visiting Positions</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jiujiang, 9th] Three reporters in Anqing were injured by Communist artillery fire while visiting positions in the eastern suburbs. The extent of their injuries is unknown.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Imposes Earlier Curfew Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] The Zhenjiang City Defense Command announced on the 9th that the curfew will be imposed earlier at 10:00 PM every night. Vehicles and pedestrians without special passes are not allowed to pass.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Chen Yi Flying to Taiwan for Recuperation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Quzhou, 9th] It was recently heard that Chen Yi has flown to Taiwan for recuperation some days ago, but this information could not be confirmed by related parties.</p>
<h3>Peace Talks Haven't Started Yet, Zhang Zhizhong and Mao Zedong Had a Long Talk the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanking, 9th] The formal meeting of the peace talks had not yet started on the 9th, but extensive exchanges of opinions before the meeting were frequent. This action also had a significant effect on the formal meeting, and some problems that could become a deadlock were also sought for a unified approach during this exchange of opinions. On the evening of the 9th, reports were received here in Peiping, confirming that there had been considerable progress in recent days.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanking, 9th] Zhang Zhizhong, the chief representative of the government's peace delegation, had his first long talk with Mao Zedong on the 8th, with very good results and a good meeting. Zhang sent a detailed telegram of the contents to Acting President Li on the 9th, but this telegram had not been received by noon on the 9th. The above situation was reported by Zhang Zhizhong in a telephone call from Peiping to the Acting President on the afternoon of the 9th.</p>
<h3>Bridgeheads North of the Yangtze Continue to Fall, Dagger Island Pier Once Lost then Recaptured, Communist Troops in Southern Section of Peiping-Hankou Railway Continue to Advance South</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] The situation at Sanjiangying, facing Zhenjiang, is unclear after two days and nights of artillery fire on the 9th. On the Yangliu Line, from Zhujiaqigan to Laosiwei, the Communist troops continued to fire from morning to noon on the 9th, seemingly with the active intention of seizing Liuwei. After the Guazhou on 12th Island were reinforced by the National Army, the situation turned stable, but about 10,000 troops from the 207th and 209th detachments of the Communist 8th Corps, which had gathered in Yizheng, formally attacked 12th Island on the 9th. The defending troops have joined forces with the Weihai warship stationed at 12th Island to fire back. Also, the Communist troops who occupied Shijiaqiao and Sanmeihe on the 8th and launched a fierce attack on Liuwei are the Bohai Column and the 7th Garrison Brigade, totaling about 10,000 people. The air force has been constantly flying low along the northern bank of the Yangtze River for reconnaissance on the 9th.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] Official news: The Communist Bohai Column recently sneaked from the Tianchang area to the area south of Yangzhou and north of Sanmao River. The Communist troops are still in the Jiaojiadang and Xiannvmiao areas north of Sanjiangying. The 23rd Army is in the area south of Taixian and north and east of Kou'an. The main force of the 28th, 29th, and 31st armies have sneaked to the area around Nantong, Rugao, and Hai'an. It is judged that the Communist troops on the opposite side seem to be in conspiracy to cooperate with the Communist central political offensive, and will exert extensive pressure on the bridgehead positions on the north bank of the Yangtze River to increase their momentum.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] The military authorities stated: The offensive launched by the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu this time is a planned action. Although bridgeheads such as Yizheng, Siyuangou, Sanmao River, and Shijiaqiao have been captured, the National Army has close cooperation and defense by the army, navy, and air force, so it is still impossible for the Communist troops to cross the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] The Zhen-Gua line resumed navigation on the 7th, with two ships per day, carrying more than 3,000 passengers and refugees to Guazhou. When proceeding towards Yangzhou, the Communist troops attacked the National Army, and more than 30 civilians were killed or injured under the ruthless artillery fire.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Changshu, 9th] The battle situation in northern Jiangsu is extremely tense, and all bridgeheads are under increasing pressure. Siyuangou and Shijiaqiao, south of Yizheng, have also successively withdrawn. It is reported that the Communist Bohai Detachment has arrived in Yangzhou, Jiaojiadang, Xiannvmiao, and other places. The 28th and 29th armies have been transferred to Nantong, Rugao, and Hai'an. The 23rd Army is gathering in the area south of Taixian and north of Kou'an.

<h3>The Actual Work of Agricultural Loans</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huamin</p>
<p>Although the government is currently facing significant financial difficulties, it still plans to issue substantial funds this year to continue providing agricultural loans. To the impoverished farming masses who believe the government has historically only "taken" from farmers and never "given," this is indeed a piece of heartening good news. On the eve of the imminent opening of these agricultural loans, the experiences and lessons learned from past work in this area should be thoroughly studied to avoid repeating past mistakes. Based on my personal observations in practical work, I offer some suggestions for the consideration and reference of those concerned about agricultural loan issues.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the simplification of procedures is essential. In the pre-war period of stable prices, rural farmers often purchased goods using a "credit system." Farmers and shops had frequent dealings, and regardless of the amount owed, everything was recorded in a ledger. Debts were usually repaid on time, and "bad debts" were as rare as "phoenix feathers and unicorn horns." The extent to which farmers emphasized credit can be seen from this. Currently, the complexity of procedures and the multitude of forms involved in agricultural loans focus entirely on formality, neglecting the farmers' actual needs and rigidly adhering to unrealistic principles set by superiors. This improper tendency can be bewildering even to the educated, and how can the so-called "illiterate" common people, when they go to the "magnificent" agricultural loan offices and face the "arrogant" bank staff, not "hesitate" and "shrink back" when confronted with the dazzling array of forms? Moreover, when agricultural loan groups receive loans, they must prepare seals and business plans, and the seals must be signed by key personnel. Most farmers are so-called "blank slates," unable to recognize even basic characters like "man," "hand," "foot," "knife," and "ruler." How can they "sign" on exquisitely printed seal papers using snow-white laid paper? How can they draft grand plans? The only option is for the guidance staff to create and draft them on their behalf, resulting in repetitive and useless documents.</p>
<p>In addition to the above forms, there are also application forms, contracts, detailed lists of member loans, registers of members' cultivated land, and copies of member loan agreements. How can these complex forms not give a headache to the so-called "simple-minded" farmers? If agricultural loan institutions claim to be "financial institutions for the common people," they should adopt a style that reflects this. Agricultural loan forms should be reduced as much as possible to provide convenience for farmers!</p>
<p>We believe that if agricultural loans are used by individual farmers, only a contract and a detailed list of loans are needed. The official seal on the seal paper and the signature of the key personnel at the back of the detailed list are sufficient. The group seal is already affixed to the detailed list of the agricultural loan group; why is a separate one needed? The "loan amount" on the application form is already in the "total" column on the detailed list, and a column can be added to the detailed list for the "loan term," thus rendering the application form unnecessary.</p>
<p>As for agricultural loans for collective management, except for larger-scale operations that require a realistic and feasible plan and loan documents, a simple letter stating the type of operation, method, and amount needed, with the official seal of the key personnel at the back, is sufficient for small-scale operations in rural areas after a thorough investigation and the drafting of a loan agreement. All seal papers, application forms, registers of cultivated land, etc., should be eliminated.</p>
<p>Secondly, the loan amount must meet the farmers' needs. In the past, agricultural loan personnel were welcomed in rural areas because of the large loan amounts. When agricultural loan institutions handled the last batch of agricultural loans last year, some loans were as low as ten-odd yuan in legal tender per mu (at the time, about five cents in alloy coins). The maximum loan amount per person was over two million yuan in legal tender, only about seven jiao (seventy cents) in alloy coins, which was less than one percent of the farmers' actual needs at the time. Therefore, agricultural loan personnel were scolded everywhere they went. Even if agricultural loan groups such as cooperatives and farmers' associations still nominally existed, farmers would demand the return of shares and membership fees and immediately dissolve the agricultural loan groups as soon as agricultural loan personnel explained the loan amount per mu. This was nominally for the development of farmers' groups and cooperative organizations, but in reality, it was destroying cooperative businesses and farmers' groups!</p>
<p>According to farmers, they could earn about six million yuan in legal tender for a day's work, which was enough to buy meat and alcohol. However, to receive agricultural loans, they had to attend meetings for the establishment of cooperatives today, committee investigations tomorrow, and loan disbursement the day after. They had to pay for their own food at the meetings, did not receive wages, and had to pay membership fees. In the end, they only received a few hundred thousand yuan in legal tender, which was not even enough for half a day's work. It was simply a joke. At the time, agricultural loan personnel were truly embarrassed and ashamed and had no words to say. It was a major satire on agricultural loan institutions. We believe that during periods of inflation and unstable prices, agricultural loans must be adjusted according to local needs to adapt to farmers' actual production costs, using reasonable methods.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is the issue of interest rates. Financial institutions must rely on deposits to exert their power. The interest rate on agricultural loans was determined by the former Fourth Joint Office to be 7.5 per cent per month, but the interest rate on deposits is still only 3 per cent per month. Now, interest rates on the black market sometimes reach 1.5 to 1.6 yuan, making agricultural loan interest rates seem too low! We know that before the war, most of the agricultural loan funds came from absorbing idle funds from various places. In the current situation of rampant inflation, why would people deposit funds, which are practically "gifts" obtained from printing institutions, for a negligible profit of about 3 per cent per month? As a result, agricultural loan funds largely rely on issuance as a source, which is a serious mistake!</p>
<p>The level of interest rates depends on the supply and demand of funds in the market and the coordination with current economic conditions. If supply exceeds demand, it will inevitably decrease; conversely, if demand exceeds supply, it will inevitably increase. Forcing restrictions through political power may be effective for a time, but it cannot be sustained for long. Currently, agricultural loan institutions should consult with the competent authorities to offer deposits in silver dollars, gold, and other commodities, determine interest rates based on market realities, absorb large amounts of idle social funds, and provide them with safe guarantees and reasonable profits to give them legitimate outlets and avoid their use for hoarding, speculation, and manipulation. This would increase the source of agricultural loan funds!</p>
<p>The issue of agricultural loans is originally part of the entire China problem. It cannot be separated from the influence and control of the actual social environment we face and must be coordinated and developed in conjunction with the reform of the entire political economy for it to be smoothly and successfully executed. In the current environment of constant artillery fire and widespread conflict, where everything is not on track, we have no reason to demand that agricultural loans be handled to the point of perfection alone. The promotion of any work cannot be segmented; it requires vertical continuity and horizontal links. However, if the shortcomings of the past are not corrected when handling a matter, how can we talk about overall reform or progress?</p>
<h3>Rising Prices Intensify, Markets in Various Regions are Chaotic, Liu Gongyun Summoned to Beijing Tonight</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Amid the soaring prices and gold notes, Finance Minister and President of the National Bank Liu Gongyun has been summoned by Premier He and is scheduled to take the night train from Shanghai to Beijing on the 10th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The prices in Nanjing suddenly skyrocketed on the 9th, and the market was extremely chaotic. This phenomenon was due to the fall of Yizheng, which tightened the military situation, and the issuance of salaries by a certain transportation agency on the 9th, which also promoted the rise of gold notes and silver dollars. The price increase on the 9th was led by gold notes, reaching its peak around noon. Gold reached a maximum of over 3.7 million per tael, US dollars 86,000, silver dollars 80,000, and rice also broke the 400,000 mark. The Wuyang market was also full of rising prices. At that time, most shops were unable to grasp the situation and found it difficult to operate, so many closed. The situation eased slightly after 4 pm and only slightly recovered by the evening.</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 9th] Prices were affected by the spread of the war on the north bank of the Yangtze River, rising sharply across the board, and the markets became even more chaotic. The grain market was closed and lacked supplies. Outside the market, white japonica rice has broken through the 300,000 mark. Cotton yarn also set a high of 10 million, a rise of 40 to 50 per cent compared to yesterday. The common people are crying out in hardship. Flour is 90,000, soybean oil is 1.8 million, wheat is 320,000, and white wheat is 371,000.</p>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Fuzhou market was unprecedentedly turbulent on the 8th, and prices were frightening. Shops refused to use bank drafts. By 6 pm, the entire city had become a dead market. Fortunately, Zhu Shaomin took emergency measures with an iron fist, selling rice and China Textile cotton yarn to recover bank drafts, instructing the Chamber of Commerce to maintain the circulation of bank drafts, and strictly ordering the military police stationed in Fuzhou to restrain their subordinates and ensure public order. By noon on the 9th, the market gradually recovered, and prices began to fall.</p>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 9th] Here, in the past three days, due to the flooding of bank drafts, the market continued to soar on the morning of the 8th after the previous two days. Rice opened at 260,000 and broke through the 300,000 mark at noon. The situation changed dramatically in the afternoon, and asking prices reached as high as 500,000 to 600,000. Most rice shops hid their rice, and those holding bank drafts could not buy rice. However, those holding gold to buy rice could still exchange one qian (approximately 3.125 grams) of gold for one shi (approximately 100 liters) of rice. Other markets were also like the buying frenzy of last October. Before 3 or 4 pm, it was still possible to buy goods with bank drafts, but the prices of goods priced in gold changed rapidly. After 3 pm, most shops refused to accept bank drafts or gold yuan notes, so many shops closed early. Gold opened at 2.67 million per tael in the morning, reached 3.5 million at noon, and 4.5 million in the evening. Gold shops only bought and did not sell. Silver dollars were quoted at 100,000, but there were no transactions. Citizens ran around in fear and could not describe their feelings. It is reported that national and provincial banks issued salaries for civil servants, teachers, military police, and employees for March starting from the 6th at 2,700 times the original amount, due to the shortage of currency. The issuance of 5,000, 10,000, and 50,000 bank drafts was temporarily printed, and by today, the banks have issued approximately 7 billion to 10 billion in total. This immediately flooded the market,搶購gold,钞票, and物价, triggering涨风and escalating into an unmanageable situation within three days.</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 9th] The Chengdu market has entered a state of madness, and the rise in prices is extremely rampant. On the 9th, rice was 240,000, gold was 2.45 million, and silver dollars were 35,000. Other goods such as yarn, cloth, general merchandise, tobacco, and sugar are also increasing rapidly, with an average increase of more than ten times the beginning of the week and 10,000 times that of August 19th. The price of living essentials changes almost ten times a day.</p>
<h3>Lanzhou's Monetary Conditions Tighten, Embezzlement and Escape are Frequent</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 9th] Lanzhou's monetary conditions are tightening, and the market is unusually chaotic. Spot cash is discounted at 250 yuan per day, and silver dollars are discounted at up to 1 per cent per day, but they are still not easy to obtain. Dozens of cases of embezzlement and escape occur every day, and some people are even committing suicide by drowning. The money position is particularly tight. Banks and financial institutions are issuing excessive cheques, leading to frequent disputes. The Central Bank will investigate and restrict this. In the past ten days, the Central Bank has transported approximately 5 billion in cash to Lanzhou, and another 7.5 billion has been allocated to Xining, Jiuquan, Tianshui, and other places. However, the payment needs of public and private institutions and the national treasury will require more than 40 billion. The cash transported is less than one-eighth of the total needs, so bank drafts can only be used to cope with the situation. If no cash continues to arrive in the coming days, the currency shortage will become even more severe.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Provincial Government Resolves to Borrow Silver Dollars to Pay Salaries</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 9th] Since the Yunnan Province approved the free circulation of semi-minted silver dollars, the price of silver dollars has been rising every day. On the morning of the 9th, it broke the 14,000 yuan mark, putting civil servants and teachers who receive gold yuan notes in dire straits. Refusal to accept salaries and strikes are occurring one after another. In order to seek relief urgently, the Provincial Government decided at its 1077th meeting to temporarily borrow silver dollars for payment and telegraphed the Executive Yuan to quickly find a thorough solution.</p>
<h3>Lan Wei-de, Younger Brother of Lan Ni, Newly Appointed Director of the Kunming National Tax Bureau, Embezzles 11,000 Silver Dollars, Regional Bureau Suspends Him Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 9th] A major corruption case has recently occurred at the Kunming Branch of the National Taxation Bureau. The newly appointed Director, Lan Wei-de (younger brother of Lan Ni), after being ordered to adjust the tax rates, contacted the Da Yun Tobacco Factory and sold them a large number of tax stamps. The factory then sent a reward fee of 11,000 silver dollars, which Director Lan personally withdrew from the Guangyu Bank. After the Regional Bureau's supervisor noticed this, the branch staff was deeply indignant. The staff requested an emergency loan, but it was denied, causing widespread anger. They requested a thorough investigation and strict punishment. The newly appointed Director of the National Taxation Bureau of Yunnan and Guizhou, Zuo Zhisheng (nephew of Xu Kan), did not express his attitude towards this, and many believed that this case had strong backing and would be difficult to resolve satisfactorily.</p>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 9th] After the major corruption case of Lan Wei-de, Director of the National Tax Inspection Bureau of Kunming, occurred, the Regional Bureau suspended Lan in advance, pending investigation. The bureau affairs are temporarily handled by Assistant Zhang Yuqi.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Prepares to Establish a Joint Treasury, Capital Temporarily Set at 5 Million Silver Dollars, Joint Treasury Bonds Will be Issued for Circulation</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] In order to effectively stabilize the currency value of Southwest China and suppress the rise in prices, the Chongqing Senate and the industrial, commercial, and financial circles have repeatedly requested the issuance of joint treasury bonds for circulation, with unlimited convertibility to silver dollars. According to reliable sources, the Chief Executive's Office is actively preparing to establish a joint reserve treasury to take charge of this matter. The capital is temporarily set at 5 million silver dollars, with the Chongqing Central Bank accounting for half and the Three Banks, Two Bureaus, and Chongqing Commercial Agencies accounting for the other half. The most highly regarded candidates for the person in charge are Liu Hangchen and Kang Xin, and the final decision will be made after Zhang Qun returns to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Quzhou Banks Issue Excessive Bank Drafts</h3>
<p>[Our Quzhou Dispatch, 9th] Amid the currency shortage, all banks here are using this as an excuse to issue excessive bank drafts, even the Lian County Bank is no exception. There are denominations such as 250,000, and some banks have bank drafts with face values as high as 100,000 or more. It is reported that some are deceiving the rural people by claiming that the drafts have not yet matured and refusing to pay cash, disrupting the financial order to an extreme degree.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Bank Approved as a Designated Foreign Exchange Bank</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 9th] Qu Jingzhou, General Manager of the Taiwan Bank, said that the Taiwan Bank has been approved by the Ministry of Finance as a designated foreign exchange bank. This is the initial step in linking the Taiwan currency with foreign exchange. The total amount of Taiwan currency issued by the end of March was over 400 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice-Snatching Riot Occurs in Fengqiao Town, Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] Rice prices have soared in recent days, and the common people are facing starvation. The rice-snatching riots during the price-limited period have reappeared. On the morning of the 9th, the Jiucheng Rice Shop in Fengqiao Town was raided by more than 50 refugees. Fortunately, the police station suppressed the riot early, so it did not expand. Three people were arrested on the spot, claiming to be refugees from Siyang, northern Jiangsu, but denied participating in the rice-snatching. They have been taken to the bureau for questioning.</p>

<h3>East-West Cold War Enters New Stage - Acheson Emphasizes Three-Power West German Agreement - Does Not Close the Door to Four-Power Agreement</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 8th] U.S. Secretary of State Acheson declared at a press conference tonight that the signing of the Atlantic Pact and the Three-Power Agreement on Germany are attempts to establish a foundation. We hope to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on this basis. Acheson pointed out that the Atlantic Pact and the Agreement on Germany have greatly strengthened the position of the Western Allies, not only in their attitude towards Europe as a whole, but also in international issues related to the Soviet Union, which will have a significant impact. Acheson declared that the U.S. attitude towards the Berlin Blockade has not changed. The U.S. does not intend to start negotiations with the Soviet Union until the blockade is lifted. He emphasized that there is nothing secret about the Three-Power Agreement on Germany from the Soviet Union, and it does not prevent the Soviet Union from eventually joining the agreement if it wishes.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 8th] French Foreign Minister Schuman hosted reporters today and emphasized that the possibility of a Four-Power Agreement on the German question still exists. It is now the Soviet Union's turn to show whether the West German example can be applied to all of Germany. He believes that the Three-Power Agreement on West Germany provides a perfect basis for future action on Germany. He repeatedly emphasized that the agreement does not conflict with the possibility of a Four-Power Agreement, and the next step in this regard will be taken by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 8th] Secretary of State Acheson stated at a press conference today that the U.S. government advocates that the High Commissioners stationed in Germany after the establishment of the German Federal Republic should be non-military personnel, and the number of occupying forces will also depend on general security needs.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 9th] U.S. diplomatic circles here are optimistic about resuming Four-Power negotiations on the German question in the near future. Their reasons are based on the moderate attitude taken by Soviet representatives at Lake Success, and the remarks made yesterday by French Foreign Minister Schuman and U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, emphasizing that the Three-Power Agreement on Germany does not conflict with the Four-Power Agreement, and only requires the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin Blockade. Another factor that makes people optimistic is that the three powers are limiting the use of veto power by the High Commissioners stationed in Germany to important issues. This indicates that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France do not want the Soviet Union to feel that once a Four-Power High Commissioners Council is created, it will still be monopolized by the veto power of the Western countries. Finally, U.S. officials pointed out that Soviet representative to the UN, Gromyko, seems to be trying to hold informal contacts with U.S. diplomats at Lake Success. They believe that the main content of these informal talks will be the German question and the Atlantic Pact question.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Three-Power Agreement on Germany - Military Administration to be Abolished Upon Establishment of German Government - High Commissioner's Office Established to Supervise</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 8th] The Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France issued a joint statement this afternoon stating that complete agreement has been reached on German issues. As soon as the new German government is established, military administration will be abolished in the occupied areas, and the three countries will only retain limited administrative power. The military governors will be replaced by High Commissioners, but the occupying forces will continue to be stationed.</p>
<p>The agreement was reached during what British Foreign Secretary Bevin called "one of the most important weeks," indicating that the long-term dispute between the three powers over Germany is coming to an end, and Germany will soon return to the international community. The key points of the Three-Power Agreement on Germany include the following: (1) Revise the occupation regulations to simplify the original regulations. The new regulations stipulate the relationship between the United States, the United Kingdom, and France and the new German government. The full text has not yet been published and will be submitted to the West German Constitutional Assembly in Bonn. (2) As soon as the new German government is established, the military government will be abolished in West Germany, and a High Commissioner's Office will be established, consisting of one High Commissioner from each of the three countries, responsible for supervising the new German government. The occupying forces will continue to be stationed, each under the command of its own commander. (3) The German government can freely handle national affairs, except in certain circumstances where the three countries retain power, such as preventing the revival of German militarism and maintaining basic relations between Germany and foreign countries. (4) The German Federal Republic can directly sign agreements with the United States, apply for assistance in accordance with the Marshall Plan, and participate in the European Economic Cooperation Organization as a member state. In addition, the three Foreign Ministers also agreed on methods for dismantling factories, restricting industries, and internationally controlling the Ruhr area. Unless the Allied powers retain power, any resolution passed by the German government can be implemented three weeks later, unless it is rejected and disapproved by the three High Commissioners, in which case it will be invalid.</p>

<h3>Judd Agrees with - Stassen's Advocacy of Aid to Asia - Accuses Washington of Consistently Prioritizing Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 9th] Representative Judd, a Republican who is a strong advocate for aid to China, came out on the 9th to preside over Stassen's "MacArthur Plan for Asia." Judd agreed with the opinion expressed in an editorial in the Minneapolis Star Tribune that the plan should not be named the MacArthur Plan, but rather the "Marshall Plan for Asia." Judd told United Press that regardless of the name of the plan, its content is the most important thing. He said: "MacArthur has always advocated treating the Asian problem as a whole, but Washington has always ignored it and, on the contrary, instructed MacArthur to pay attention to Japan." He said: "However, the success or failure of MacArthur in Japan will depend on the situation in Asia. If Asia becomes communist, Japan will also become communist. I know that MacArthur is eager to make the State Department recognize that East Asia must be seen as an organic whole, just like Western Europe, but the State Department seems to think that the same theory does not apply to Asia. They value Europe but abandon Asia, adopting different policies in Europe and Asia."</p>
<h3>On Handling Italian African Colonies - Soviet Representative Explains Position - Still Insists on Adopting Joint Trusteeship System</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 9th Broadcast: In today's UN Political Committee, Soviet Representative Gromyko explained the Soviet Union's position on handling Italian African colonies, still insisting on adopting a joint trusteeship system. Gromyko said that this move is in line with the suggestion made by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes at the Four-Power Conference in 1945. According to the views of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France at the time, the distance between opinions was very far, except that a part of Eritrea should belong to Abyssinia. Gromyko also suggested that Libya be allowed to gain independence after ten years. During this period, the region should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations, with an administrator to manage it. In addition, a consultative committee composed of European and Arab residents from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Libya should be organized to assist the administrator in handling all administration. Gromyko then severely criticized the United Kingdom's unilateral decision to hand over the Mellaha Air Base in Tripolitania to the United States for use, believing that the United Kingdom had no right to make this decision.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Exercises Veto Power for the 30th Time - Prevents South Korea from Joining the United Nations - South Korean Representative Accuses Soviet Union of Malicious Action</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 8th] The Soviet Union today vetoed South Korea's application to join the United Nations in the UN Security Council. Soviet Representative Malik pointed out that the South Korean government is a U.S. puppet and violates the will of the people. U.S. Representative Austin replied that South Korea is actually a peace-loving country. Representatives from China and Canada also supported South Korea's membership. The result of the vote was nine to two, with the Soviet Union and Ukraine voting against. The Security Council resolution requires only seven votes for legal voting, but the entire case was rejected due to the Soviet Union's veto. This is the 30th time the Soviet Union has exercised its veto power.</p>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 8th] Zhao Bingyu, South Korea's chief representative to the United Nations, issued a statement immediately after the Soviet Union exercised its veto power to prevent South Korea's application to join the United Nations, denouncing the Soviet Union's "abuse and improper use of veto power." The statement said, "I believe that this action by the Soviet Union insults the Korean people and is another malicious fact that obstructs the activities of the United Nations." He continued, "The only reason is that the Soviet Union is determined to control and occupy the Korean peninsula in order to make it a strategic base for the Communist Party's policy of conquering the world."</p>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 8th] South Korean representative Zheng Huanfan said today that the Soviet Union's exercise of veto power over South Korea's application to join the United Nations organization is a malicious action and insults the South Korean people. The Soviet Union's motive for this move is nothing more than to use and occupy all of Korea as a military base to carry out the Communist Party's policy of conquering the world.</p>

<h3>Royal Points Out My Situation - Hinders Japan's Restoration - Situation in Korea Also Increases Difficulties in the Far East</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 9th] Former Secretary of the Army Royal recently reported to the House Appropriations Committee, mentioning the situation in China. The original statement was released today, stating that the situation in China makes our country's problems in the East more complicated. China's raw materials are used by Japan less and less, and the sales of Japanese-made products in the Chinese market are shrinking. This situation will hinder Japan's economic restoration, which we are working hard to achieve. The unstable situation in Korea also increases difficulties in the Far East. Under these circumstances, MacArthur hopes to send more troops to the Far East, but we cannot effectively increase the number of troops stationed in the Far East. The U.S. occupying forces in Japan, Korea, and Okinawa number about 135,000. The morale of the U.S. military is generally very high.</p>
<h3>Cominform Maliciously Slanders - Southern Leader Sternly Reprimands</h3>
<p>[Reuters Belgrade, 9th] Southern Prime Minister Marshal Tito delivered a speech to the Third Congress of the Yugoslav People's Front today, stating that Yugoslavia cannot follow in the footsteps of the imperialists. The Southern country is building socialism and has achieved great success. It is a mistake for all war profiteers and reactionaries in capitalist countries to speculate about Yugoslavia because of the status of the Southern country today and the attitude of Eastern European countries towards the Southern country. On this point, the attitude of the Southern country has always been consistent. Tito talked about the Cominform's attacks on Yugoslavia, saying that the more intense these attacks, the more resolute the Southern people's revolutionary will to resist. The Cominform's propaganda is not Marxist, and it not only harms the reputation of socialist methods, but may even have unimaginable consequences for the world's revolutionary development.</p>

The United States inspects Philippine newspapers, and U.S. films and propaganda spread throughout the Philippines. After the war, the United States handed over the Philippine government to pro-Japanese elements. The United States has repeatedly sacrificed the interests of the Philippines for Japan, such as exporting Philippine sand in exchange for Japanese toys. Philippine President Quirino is actually a U.S. puppet. Quirino, under the orders of the United States, called for the conclusion of a Pacific military alliance to divert the attention of Philippine workers from the difficulties of life.</p>

<h3>Railway Bureau Automatically Adjusts Fares: To Be Implemented from the 13th: Increase of Approximately Five Times More Based on Approved Calculation Method</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway Bureau will, starting on the 13th of this month, following the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railway Bureau, automatically adjust fares (Note: the Yuehan Railway already automatically increased prices on April 4th). The extent of the increase is still under final consideration. It is reported that if calculated according to the calculation method approved by the Legislative Yuan, the basic passenger fare will be 208 yuan and 37 fen per kilometer, and the freight fare will be 277 yuan, 8 jiao, and 5 fen per kilometer, an increase of more than five times compared to the current fares.</p>
<p>This is the second time the two railways have automatically adjusted fares. The last time was after the major strikes on both railways, because the salaries of the employees of the two railways were changed to be converted from the market price of rice, and they had to increase fares to maintain a balance of payments. Subsequently, in February, a formulaic adjustment began to be implemented. Although there were repeated coal shortages, the railway bureau was able to purchase in batches or ask the Central Bank for advances to manage, barely maintaining operations. However, since April, the Legislative Yuan has stipulated that railway fares be adjusted monthly, making it impossible for fares to keep up with rising prices. In recent weeks, prices have risen wildly. The gap between the railway bureau's income and expenses has widened. Since March 11, coal prices have risen twelve-fold, rice prices have risen seven-fold, while railway fares have risen only two-fold, making it impossible to purchase coal for daily train operation. The salaries of employees for March have not yet been settled. The director of the bureau, Wang Zhaohuai, went to Nanjing the other day to report the current situation of the two railways to the Ministry of Transportation and the necessity of automatically increasing prices.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhaohuai Issues a Statement: Describes the Difficult Situation</h3>
<p>Wang returned to Shanghai yesterday and told reporters: "Although the fares of our railway have been adjusted repeatedly, they are still difficult to compare with general prices. The recent adjustment on April 1st was only approved to increase by one time, which was already inconsistent with reality. It has not been ten days yet, and prices have risen even more wildly, making the gap even greater. The two most important items for transportation costs, coal and rice, are particularly severe. Our bureau needs at least 21,000 tons of coal per month, which is coordinated by the Fuel Management Committee, with foreign coal, Kai-luan coal, and Taiwanese coal supplied in batches. Foreign coal was 99,864 yuan on March 11, and today (April 9) it is 1,270,800 yuan, an increase of 12.7 times. Kai-luan coal was 91,542 yuan on March 11, and today it is 671,500 yuan, an increase of 7.4 times. Taiwanese coal was 83,220 yuan on March 11, and today it is 415,720 yuan, an increase of 5 times. Our bureau's passenger and freight fares have only increased by two times for passenger transport and 2.4 times for freight transport from March 11 to today. In order to maintain the livelihoods of employees and keep the railway running smoothly, our bureau, following the orders of the Ministry of Transportation, calculates salaries based on rice units. Although the burden is greater, it is a necessary burden to ensure that employees can work with peace of mind. However, the price of white rice was 36,500 yuan on March 11, and today it has reached the 300,000 yuan mark. The disparity between expenditures and income is truly alarming. In desperation, on the one hand, we borrowed coal from the Central Bank for emergency relief, and on the other hand, we requested subsidies from the Ministry of Transportation. However, when the coal is returned, it must be settled according to the coal price on the payment date. Before the subsidies arrive, a certain amount is allocated from the daily operating income, which is a drop in the bucket and has become a situation that can never be repaid. For example, our bureau requested a special coal fund of 3 billion yuan on March 15, and 1 billion yuan was approved on March 21, but the fund was not allocated by the Central Bank until April 8. At that time, it could purchase 7,564 tons of coal, but when it was received, it could only purchase 1,089 tons. For more than two months, we first worked hard to stabilize the lives of employees and maintain transportation order, and then we spent painstaking efforts to raise both black and white food rations. As of today, 40% of our bureau's employees' salaries for March have not yet been paid, and the fuel coal will run out by the 14th of this month. The Ministry of Transportation's subsidy for April is as much as 7 billion, but it has not yet been allocated. When it is allocated, it will be used to pay off old debts of more than 5 billion. If the time is too late, I am afraid it will be more than this number. Therefore, our bureau's financial difficulties have reached the brink of collapse. In view of the importance of transportation on both railways, I will naturally do my best to maintain it. However, the difficulties of the situation are such that I hope people from all walks of life will understand."</p>
<h3>Resolutely Collect Security Donations: Severe Punishment for Those Who Refuse to Comply</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Regarding the collection of security donations in this city, since the collection began on March 6, there have been many people from all walks of life who have enthusiastically collected and turned in the donations.

<h3>Xingguo Road Improvement Project: Has Been Fully Completed</h3>
<p>Xingguo Road in this city is one of the main north-south connecting roads in the western district. It was originally an unfinished dirt road. The open ditches and gratings on both sides were dilapidated. However, the traffic on the road has become increasingly busy. The City Council once resolved to repair and pave the road, but the project could not be carried out due to a shortage of funds. Recently, the Public Works Bureau, in view of the increasing number of houses on both sides of the road and the large number of vehicles passing through, used the materials in the bureau's stock to piece together and build police well gratings and side ditches on the road with great effort, and added a coal cinder pavement. The project is now fully completed.</p>
<h3>More Than 20,000 Regular New Recruits: Must Be Collected Within the Deadline</h3>
<p>This city's quota of new recruits for the 38th year of the Republic of China is 37,000.

However, so far, the collection work has not yet started due to the impact of the settlement allowance for new recruits. It is learned that because this city is a commercial and industrial hub, the conscription method is divided into two types: regular and reserve. The regular quota is 23,000, which must be collected within the specified deadline for paying soldiers. The reserve quota is 14,000, which will be collected when necessary. The recruitment quota will be deducted from the reserve quota. The age of eligible men to be conscripted this year is those born in the 13th to 17th years of the Republic of China, i.e., those who are 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25 years old.</p>

<h3>The City's Grain Storage Problem: Has Been Approved by the National Bank: However, the Number of Overseas Grain Allocations Obtained Must First Be Checked</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Regarding the purchase of 1.2 million dan of rice needed by this city before September, it has been decided that the central government will be responsible for purchasing half of it overseas, and the remaining half will be allowed for rice merchants to mortgage funds and purchase domestically.

(2) Cancel the method of paying salaries according to the previous period's index. In principle, salaries must be paid according to the current period's index. The method will be submitted to the general meeting for discussion, and the general meeting will be convened before the 15th of this month.</p>

<h3>Forging Graduation Certificates: School Principal and Teacher Convicted</h3>

<h3>Another Trunk Murder: Corpse of Child with Wounds Found on Rue Ratard</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, a large, ownerless old leather trunk was discovered near the entrance of Lane 556 on Rue Ratard, within the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Monopoly Bureau Police Station. A female child's corpse, approximately four years old, was retrieved by a patrol officer and taken back to the branch station. Director Wang promptly telegraphed Chief Forensic Pathologist Liang Hanfen of the General Bureau to come to the scene for examination. The girl was wearing red corduroy pants, a beige cotton undershirt, coffee-colored floral socks, and light yellow corduroy cotton shoes. Her upper body was wrapped in a white gauze window curtain, and a dark navy blue vest was placed beneath the corpse. Dr. Liang thoroughly examined the child's body and found blood in her nostrils, as well as purple and blue bruises on her abdomen, buttocks, arms, and forehead, suggesting injuries inflicted by adults. Additionally, there were blue marks on her thighs and calves, as if from being beaten with a stick, and her abdomen was distended. The forensic pathologist deduced that the girl had been subjected to constant torture by adults before her death, and ultimately suffocated after being wrapped in a cotton blanket. It is suspected that she was abused to death by a stepmother.

<h3>Good Intentions Lead to Unexpected Disaster: Two Young Men Sentenced for Robbery</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Shi Zhang Xuezhi, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 25 Hengan Lane, Yongjia Road, is from a wealthy family. This Lunar New Year, Zhang Yaohui, a young man from the same hometown, along with his friend Yang Jun, came to offer New Year greetings. Shi, considering that Zhang and his companion were lodging in expensive hotels in Shanghai, extended hospitality out of hometown fellowship and invited them to stay at her home. They departed on the fifth day of the New Year. Unexpectedly, on the night of February 22nd of this year, two masked, ochre-painted robbers suddenly appeared at Shi's home and stole valuable jewelry, including a 1.40-carat diamond ring, a gold anklet, two pairs of pearl earrings, three gemstone rings, and other miscellaneous items.

<h3>Gunfire in the Middle of the Night on North Zhongshan Road: Barking Dogs Awaken Owner, Single-Handedly Repelling Multiple Robbers, Dozens of Shots Exchanged, No Fatalities or Injuries</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Tao Fulin, a 28-year-old local resident and military officer at the Supply Station of the Air Force Supply Headquarters at Dachang Airport, resides at No. 1 Taojiazhai, North Zhongshan Road. Around 1:45 AM yesterday morning, Tao was suddenly awakened from his sleep by loud barking from his dogs. He got up and looked out the west window, discovering two figures by the bamboo fence to the north, climbing over it. Tao shouted, "Who's there?" In response, the other party immediately drew a gun and aimed to fire. To gain the upper hand, Tao immediately drew his handgun and fired a shot in the direction of the assailants, who then retreated. He then looked out from a window to the north and saw six robbers with handguns, ammunition boxes, and other weapons waiting. After the first two robbers crossed the fence, they opened the gate to let them in. At that moment, Tao, without regard for his own safety, fired his gun again. The robbers immediately returned fire, and the two sides exchanged dozens of shots for ten minutes. Due to the darkness, it was difficult to aim, and there were no fatalities or injuries. Finally, the robbers scattered into the darkness, fleeing into the jurisdiction of the nearby Dachang Branch Bureau. Two officers, Nos. 7740 and 7551, stationed at the police kiosk in that area, saw people passing by in the middle of the night and ordered them to stop, but they did not comply. The officers then fired eight shots from their rifles, none of which hit. All the robbers escaped. Afterwards, upon receiving the report, the Zhabei Police Bureau, under the command of Director Zhang, ordered Section Chief Jiang Ying to supervise inspectors Wang Shusheng and Rui Wenzhen, along with a large number of detectives in plain clothes, to drive to the scene in police vehicles to pursue the robbers. The robbers had already fled far away. Only one hand grenade, one bullet, and four shell casings were found under the bamboo fence. These were taken back to the branch station and sent to the General Bureau for examination. A search for the escaped robbers is underway.</p>
<h3>Textile Industry Representatives Visit Finance Minister Liu, Requesting Exemption from Import Duties on Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>Due to the difficulty in obtaining raw cotton, the textile industry in this city plans to order foreign cotton to increase the supply. However, due to the substantial import duties, they are unable to afford it. Yesterday, representatives from the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Textile Association, including Rong Erren, Guo Dihuo, Tang Xinghai, Wang Zizhen, and Wang Zuoyi, visited Finance Minister and Governor of the National Bank Liu Gongyun to request a waiver of import duties on foreign cotton. Mr. Liu stated that he would discuss solutions with relevant parties after returning to the capital. Additionally, when paying salaries at the end of last month, the various yarn factories faced significant difficulties due to a shortage of cash in the market, leading to repeated disputes. Yesterday, the textile industry representatives also spoke to Liu Gongyun about the need to provide the textile industry with convenient access to cash when paying salaries in mid-month. Mr. Liu stated that the current cash shortage has been resolved, and if yarn factories experience a cash shortage when paying salaries, they can apply to the Business Bureau for appropriate assistance.</p>

<h3>Invoking Souls on the Grassland! (Part 1): Photographer Zhan Jinshui's Posthumous Diary Reveals the Mystery of the Sanguoluo Incident</h3>
<p>— Xiao Sai</p>
<p>"Where can pure customs be found in the Central Plains? In ancient times, all races were united. For thousands of miles, the Qiaolin traveled endlessly. The horse-headed mirror enters the silkworm bushes."</p>
<p>(Xie Wuliang's poem when Zhan Jinshui bought the western travel grassland)</p>
<p>Since the desertion to independence in the spring of 1948 by Kang Guangming, a Sanguoluo officer, who requested the provincial government to demarcate the boundary between Western Sichuan and Qinghai Province, Ma Bijie was made head of the comfort corps, creating the "Sanguoluo Incident" of the Sichuan border issue. The relatives of the victims in Rong are fighting for the repayment of the blood debts of Zhan Jinshui and others.</p>
<p>Sanguoluo is located in the Yellow River Basin, south of the Bayan Har Mountains, at the foot of Mount Jishi. It is a mysterious grassland in western Sichuan, rich in products, with rare "uranium" existing, placer gold all over the river, and magnificent scenery, but it is all controlled by officers and local Buddhas, who consider it a treasure of the mountain. Even Renault was tempted to go there.</p>
<p>Departing from Rong: The matter is as follows: On April 10th, photographer Zhan Jinshui and others, who participated in the comfort corps, set off from Rong. The companions included doctors Liao Hongdao and Mo Kunqi, and Liu Shican from the Frontier People's Guidance Office. They gathered in Guanxian and Songpan to prepare for departure. Veterinarian Wang Kaiyuan and several translators were added, and dozens of Tibetan soldiers were dispatched, flying the yellow flag with the "Ma" character and carrying guns. Commander Ma, a Han official, also prepared a reclining chair, a marching bed, a radio, and a chef, intending to flaunt Han power in front of the barbarian tribes in the Damowa area.</p>
<p>Later, they crossed the Yellow River from Aba and reached their destination, Gongmasang.</p>
<p>From Zhan Jinshui's diary (which was fortunately brought back by his nephew, who survived the ordeal), we can see the whole picture of the "Sanguoluo Incident" and the truth of the incident.</p>
<p>"April 16th, departed from Guanxian, 16 sedan chairs, a mighty formation like a long snake. Light rain, a hint of cold in the mountains. 17th, passed Niangzi Ridge, 18th, passed Feisha Pass, 19th, passed the cable bridge, inspection very strict, no passage allowed without a pass. Crossing Qipan Pass and Wenchuan, the mountain road is rugged, the city is as small as a dipper, chicken feather shops are everywhere. Banqiao Pass, 20 miles from the city, was the site of the battle between General Li Jiayu and the Communist Party in the 24th year of the Republic of China. Now this western Sichuan battlefield is full of broken tiles, ruined walls, and overgrown weeds. 20th, arrived at Maozhou City."</p>
<p>"The next day, Commander Ma and I went to the commissioner's office (Zhan Jinshan was the secretary of the comfort corps and a photographer for the Universal Pictorial) to visit Commissioner He, talking about their expedition's experience in the grasslands last year, and his tireless struggle against the opium bandits; and this Heishui area is still difficult to thoroughly clear up to this day."</p>
<p>Jinshui was quite naive. He wrote, "I used to be a skinny person, but now I'm fat, which shows that travel life can also help the body and mind." Who knew that he would later be killed, truly making human affairs difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Songpan Sounds "May 29th, everyone is busy preparing to depart for the grassland. Commander Ma is like a troupe leader, wondering how to keep the show going. The funds allocated by the provincial government, from Songpan to Sanguoluo, will be used to transport the entire troupe in just four days. I wonder what trump card Commander Ma will use? Will he dig into his own pocket to complete this great mission? Everyone believes that Chairman Wang will definitely add a lot to the funding. Cattle and horses are all gathered at the county bank. The advance team departs from the north city in a mighty fashion. Troupe leader Ma Bijie is still frantic to raise silver dollars. The water in Songpan is hard. The small business owners who started with black and white have enough prestige to make the troupe leader suffer."</p>
<p>"Following the Jinhe Dam and turning right into the Chuanzigou, officers lined up to see us off, and a string of firecrackers echoed in the empty valley. June 1st, the mountains and rivers were rugged, and we left Huangsheng Pass. The temperature had dropped to 40 degrees. The last Han-style feast, mounting horses, I tore my trousers while riding a horse, at the disadvantageous Jiapo plain, where I had to sew my own trousers that night."</p>
<p>"Heading north to Hamafan and Haji fan, the road is full of yellow flowers, Guanyin willows, growing all over the mountains and rivers, as well as dog tongue flowers and four-petaled red orchids, etc. Asking the Tibetans, they don't know the name of this place anymore, suffering the draughtsmen Wu Pingzhang, Kang Keming, and Tie Zhenxi, who are all gathered here. Twenty-odd tents. I think that when Liu Huangshu was in the Liaoying camp, it was only like this. The horse bells outside the tent rang in the wind, and I remembered the story of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang hearing the bells in the rain during his exile in Shu."</p>
<p>Settling in the Basin "On the 4th, crossing Zheboba Zhi (meaning foot of the mountain) and crossing Zheboba Mountain, as soon as we entered Niangjiakan, it was completely grassland. The water is below, the grass is above. If cattle and horses are not careful, they will fall into the mire. The pioneers circled around to find a way. My little donkey fell into the mud. Ropes were used for rescue. Both people and horses felt strenuous. Although the Eight Trigrams Formation is said to be magical, I think it is definitely more difficult to ride on this grassland. Overnight at the first pasture in Mohei. These places are not governed by any government. The previous expedition did not give them face and even stole horses and guns. On the 7th, we passed Aqiu Gengka Se Er Ya Kou River, and on the 8th, we arrived at Aji Gongkang, the site of the ancient battlefield of Sanguoluo. Cypress trees grow on the bright red soil. It is said that if a local destroys a branch, the whole family will die."</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Fortress Chief Commander Wu Guangwen Flees in Fear of Punishment</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Wujin, 8th] On the 29th of last month, eleven privately owned cargo ships, fully loaded with military supplies such as kerosene, gasoline, and paper, secretly took the Houqiao route to Sanjiali, Shitougang, where they were seized by soldiers of the local fortress garrison command. The garrison commander, Wu Guangwen, was initially deceived, and the unscrupulous merchants offered him 30 taels of gold as a bribe to let them pass. They initially paid in gold rings, gold nuggets, etc., totaling six taels of gold, and the remainder was redeemed with multiple pieces of cotton yarn. Wu Guangwen tacitly agreed to let them go, and the eleven cargo ships secretly left the port that night and went elsewhere. Soon after, Fortress Commander Dai Rongguang received a secret report and discovered the matter. Dai immediately placed Wu Guangwen under surveillance. At the same time, the stolen goods, including gold and cotton yarn, were seized. On the 6th, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the First Pacification Zone jointly formed a military-political inspection team and arrived in Cheng. Commander Ding also came to Cheng to inspect the coastal defense. Commander Dai immediately transferred the entire case to the inspection team for interrogation. While the investigation team's inspection group was beginning to question him, Wu Guangwen suddenly fled without a trace. The inspection group has now ordered Commander Dai to arrest the fugitive and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Nanxun: The Silent Village (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Decline of the Silk Industry: The reason for the decline of the Nanxun silk industry is the lack of improvement. When the American tour group came, there was no silk factory. The Americans were very surprised. Later, they learned that each person produced their own homemade silk. Homemade silk cannot be standardized, and the density and individual pieces are not uniform, which is not ideal. Mr. Zhang, the chairman of the Nanxun silk industry association, told the reporter: "The reason for the decline of the Nanxun silk industry is because the original silkworm species have been lost. According to the Japanese method, the original species are preserved by the state, and hybrid species are initiated by the people. If we do not preserve the original species and only raise improved species, then the improved species will come from foreign countries. Foreign countries know that China is a formidable competitor, so naturally they will not give us good species. In addition, farmers sell cocoons in order to earn more money beyond the cost, so they bring the cocoons down the mountain before the 'precious reality' of silk spinning is complete, in order to increase the weight." Yes, the reporter also encountered cases where government-funded cocoon traders and silk factories deliberately lowered the price of cocoons to collect them. Therefore, in order to encourage the raising of good silkworms and the spinning of good silk, we should generously give prices and not let cheap cocoons lead to sick farmers and then sick silk.</p>
<p>Gentle Water Village: The reporter went to Nanxun to investigate in late March of this year. The population of Nanxun before the war was 35,000, but now it is only 18,000. Most of the tall houses were destroyed by fire. There is a Nanxun Middle School, 15 elementary schools, a nursery, and a public hospital. Lin Liyuan, the young and capable headmaster of the middle school, hired the writer Xu Chi as the director of academic affairs. They both told the reporter: "The commercial and salt transport of Nanxun is actually bureaucratic capital, and now that it is officially sold and transported, it is declining. The pawnshop industry exploits the poor and is gradually declining. Only silk can be improved and progressed, and strive for glory on the international stage." I told Brother Xu Chi: "Nanxun has a very good environment, it is a cultural and gentle water village, especially silk is famous internationally. It is best to add a silkworm research department to the school to cooperate with the improvement of Nanxun silk." He said that he loved his hometown the most, that private, quiet, and comfortable place, and his hometown can only work hard in the silk industry. Several of us went to Xiaoyunzhuang for a tour. The window lattices and railings of the pavilions and buildings there are mostly dilapidated, but looking at the overall layout, we can still see the luxury of the past. Adjacent to Xiaoyunzhuang is the Liu family's library, which we also visited. The place where the books are stored has been sealed off, fearing theft by criminals. It is said that it contains more than 100,000 volumes, including the Yongle Encyclopedia, of which there are only 24 copies in the country, and this building contains 18 copies. In the past, the Zhejiang Provincial Library came here to copy them by hand. Outside the library building, there are pavilions, gardens, flowers and trees, a quiet environment, just a good place to cultivate one's nature and read books.</p>
<p>Return Home and Work Hard: According to Brother Lin Liyuan, "Most of the rich people in Nanxun now have gone to Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places because they can't bear to see the ruins of the empty village, but to revive the place, build the hometown, and make silk famous abroad again, everyone must come back and work hard."</p>
<p>He also told the reporter, "Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, who had the most constructive spirit in the past, is now recuperating in New York, and his eyes have become blind. He originally wanted to return to China, but because the situation was unstable, he did not plan to return."</p>
<p>Yes, Nanxun had its historical status in the past, but now it appears desolate, ruined, silent and lonely. "Silent loneliness is unbearable." We must cheer up, break through this loneliness, and restore Nanxun to prosperity!</p>
<p>Letter: Recently, Mr. Xue Housheng, an engineer and reader of this newspaper, wrote to us stating that in the article "The Treasures of Zhejiang - Fluorite Mines" by reporter Huang Xingtian of this newspaper, there is a slight supplement regarding the 82% of the total fluorite output used as a smelting solvent for iron. He said that fluorite is also known as fluorite (originally named Tlourite, or Tlourspar). Its main use is in metallurgy (such as steel, antimony, lead, aluminum, iron, manganese, copper, gold, silver, etc.), but 82% of the total output should be aluminum smelting solvent. The most urgent need in our country now is the Taiwan Aluminum Industry Co., Ltd., which is most urgently needed. I would like to have it published as above.</p>

<h3>Tragic Love Killing in Nanchang: Hardworking Female Student Wu Qiyun Dies Under a Sharp Blade; Killer Hong Min Talks Openly About the Murder After Being Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanchang, 6th] A tragic love killing recently unfolded in the northern residential area of Nanchang City, by the bank of the Yan Gong Temple River in Xiashawo. The female protagonist in the case was hardworking student Wu Qiyun. After the case was discovered, the killer Hong Min was arrested by the police and confessed to the murder process without concealment.</p>
<p>The female protagonist Wu Qiyun, was 24 years of age, hailing from Jinhua, Zhejiang. She possessed a beautiful appearance and slender figure and graduated from Nanchang Women's School.</p>
<p>She was a pitiful child who lost her father. When she was ten years old, her father passed away, leaving her and her mother behind in this city. When the Japanese army invaded Nanchang, her mother took her to Qingjiang to take refuge. Afterwards, they moved to Taihe, where prices soared and life became difficult. Wu took to copying for others, earning meager profits in order to support her mother. Later, Taihe also became precarious, and the mother and daughter relied on each other and fled to Jishui, less than a day's journey from Ji'an, to stay temporarily.</p>
<p>While fleeing in Jishui, they met a man named Yan Shuren. Yan, seeing that they were an old mother and a weak daughter, repeatedly used tricks and showed great diligence to Wu, using the excuse of introducing her to work to lure her to the countryside of Ji'an, plotting to hide her away. Wu was alert and took the opportunity to flee home in the middle of the night, fortunately not falling into Yan's trap. After the victory and return, she returned to Nanchang and was admitted to a certain girls' school as a free student, studying hard day and night, and fortunately achieved success.</p>
<p>Recently, Wu's studies at the school were progressing well. One day, she suddenly met a young man named Hong Min on the street, whom she had met in Taihe. They fell in love, and there was talk of marriage, but a change suddenly occurred. Hong Min, hearing rumors that Wu was in love with someone else, became increasingly suspicious of her and eventually distanced himself. Wu did not know that Hong had changed and did not take any precautions. Who knew that Hong's love for Wu had led to a secret murderous intent.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 31st of last month, Hong invited Wu out to watch the movie "Rose of Tralee" at "The Great World." Wu gladly went with him. After the first showing ended, the two strolled together, talking as they walked, feeling very close. Later, they went to the northern city park for a tender conversation. Wu never knew that Hong harbored murderous intentions. When they arrived at the riverside near Yan Gong Temple in Xiashawo, Hong suddenly produced a sharp knife and stabbed Wu violently in the abdomen and head, resulting in her tragic death.</p>
<p>Wu fell to the ground under the sharp blade, lying supine on the riverside. She was discovered the next morning, and this love killing spread throughout Nanchang. The deceased had permed hair, a red hairpin on her right forehead, a short blue-patterned jacket on her upper body, a short coat, blue suit pants, flesh-colored stockings, and yellow leather shoes. Her body was covered in mud and blood, with a three-inch long knife wound in her stomach and an inch-long knife wound on her right forehead. Her hands were clenched tightly, indicating that she had struggled fiercely before her death.</p>
<p>After the incident, the police officers went out to arrest the murderer and obtained clues from the woman's mother. They finally arrested the criminal Hong Min at the South Railway Station. He confessed to the case and the murder process in full detail, without concealment. As for how he will be dealt with, it remains to be examined and reviewed by the authorities.</p>

<p>(2) Letter from the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau</p>

<h3>Food Rice Resumes Free Trading; Japonica and Indica Rice Nearing the 300,000 Mark</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Rice trading has been deregulated, with price controls lifted and free buying and selling restored as of yesterday. Market transactions have resumed, but due to extreme shortages of supply and robust sales, coupled with the soaring prices of gold and banknotes, prices have skyrocketed. Spot payments for white japonica rice are at $275,000, high-quality rice is at $290,000, and next week's payment terms require $340,000. Spot payments for thin indica rice are at $280,000, next week's payment terms require $340,000, and early rice is at $320,000, all experiencing a sharp increase of 50%. The total supply to both markets is 3,089 piculs.</p>
<p>Another report: Regarding the recent surge in food rice prices, the person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau stated yesterday: "Recently, gold, banknotes, and all commodities have been rising sharply. It would be unwise to solely suppress rice prices. What the Social Affairs Bureau is paying attention to are: (1) preventing food rice from becoming a target of speculation; (2) preventing the market from using food as a bargaining chip. Two-thirds of the food required by this city is supplied by household rations, and only one-third depends on the market. If food can be reasonably channeled, this city will definitely not experience a food shortage. This city is currently preparing to store food for five months: April, May, June, July, and August. The supply for April has already been secured, and the remaining months' reserves are being gathered."</p>
<h3>Flour Surges; Cooking Oil Skyrockets</h3>
<p>Cooking oil prices have skyrocketed, with the situation becoming perilous. The speed of the increase is unprecedented. Raw soybean oil is quoted at $2,000,000, with the closing price at $2,200,000, a rise of 65%. Raw rapeseed oil is at $1,880,000, and drums of raw oil are at $2,100,000, both rising by 60%. Sesame oil and tea oil have both risen by 50-60%. Soybean cakes have also risen by 50%.</p>
<p>Flour market continues its upward surge. The opening market was buoyed by easing credit conditions, with strong interest from all parties. Prices for all brands of flour broke through the $100,000 mark, with the highest price for "Old Car" brand reaching $125,000, and "Battleship" brand reaching $122,000. Some sellers took profits during the session, causing a temporary pullback, but after the closing, the price of gold continued to rise, and sellers strongly increased their premiums to account for two-day interest. Furthermore, with the current situation being highly unpredictable, sentiment is largely bullish, and the market resumed its upward trend. The forward price for "Old Car" brand is $124,000, and "Battleship" brand opened at $119,000, an increase of over 40% from the previous session. Bran quickly followed suit, with large bags nearing the $100,000 mark.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains are experiencing an increasingly fierce price surge. Yellow soybeans have surged by 60-70%, with raw kernels breaking through the $7,000 mark. The sesame market is stagnant, with white sesame quoted as high as $600,000. Mung beans are being eagerly sought after by various trading houses, jumping by around 70%. Corn has jumped by 50%, and sorghum by 40%.</p>
<h3>Credit Conditions Loosen; Many Shanghai Stocks Rise to Limit</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai stock market saw a general rise yesterday due to rising prices of commodities outside the exchange, easing credit conditions, and a glimmer of hope in current affairs news, which boosted confidence.</p>
<p>Wing On Textiles opened at $26, but profit-taking from overnight positions caused the market to soften, dropping to $24.8. Banking and cotton yarn interests actively bought on dips, leading to strong buying interest and a straight upward surge to a high of $29.8. Securities firms and large investors pushed down the price, and short sellers frequently applied pressure from outside the market, causing several dips, hovering around $28.5. Subsequently, the rush to sell gold dissipated, and overnight interest rates opened lower at $35-$40 for Wing On Textiles, benefiting the longs. Strong players resumed buying, causing the market to break through and rise again to $30, but scattered sellers took profits near the close, causing a slight pullback to close at $28.8.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks opened relatively flat, but as Wing On Textiles repeatedly hit new highs, various parties actively bought, causing them to rise to the limit. Sin Wah rose to the limit at $6.6, New Asia at $2.16, and Taiwan Sugar also rose to the limit at $58,800. Nine other stocks also reached their daily limit, including New China Department Store, Commercial Press, Great China, and Zhabei. Although Ching Foo and Myers did not reach the limit, their gains were also near the maximum allowable. For the next session, Wing On Textiles opened at $31 and immediately rose to the limit. Applications to close trades also rose to a high of $30.02. All other stocks rose across the board. The total daily turnover was 4.3368 billion shares.</p>
<h3>Gold Surges Dramatically</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday's gold market again showed a market with prices but no trading volume. The announcement that the Central Bank would issue silver dollar notes caused excitement among various parties, and prices were bid up to $2,280,000 in the morning, but demand still exceeded supply. The Central Bank did not intervene by selling gold. By noon, transactions remained largely at a standstill. The market was closed in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Another report: Over-the-counter trading remained active, as prices in other locations rose sharply, bringing a flood of positive news.</p>
<p>The morning opened relatively flat at $2,400,000 and $2,450,000. Some long positions were taken, causing a slight drop to $2,370,000 and $2,420,000. Midday, rumors that the monetary system would be reformed caused strong buying interest from Guangdong trading houses and securities firms, pushing prices up to $2,700,000 and $2,730,000. The afternoon closing was slightly lower at $2,630,000 and $2,680,000.</p>

<h3>Silver Dollars Surge</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday's silver dollar arbitrage was characterized by significant price discrepancies across regions, leading to market confusion and reduced trading volume. Several hundred thousand dollars were arbitraged out of Hankou, Shantou, Chongqing, and Wanxian. Street trading started flat but tightened later.</p>
<p>The morning was relatively stable, with "Big Heads" quoted at $45,000 and $47,000. Soon after, as gold prices jumped again, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places reported sharp increases.

<h3>Yarn Prices Jump 30%; Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>The yarn market is experiencing extremely active trading, with a trend toward frenzy. Sentiment is uniformly upward, and buyers are scrambling to purchase. All parties are adhering to a holding strategy, resulting in a surge of over 30%.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix yarn opened at $17,000,000 and briefly approached the $20,000,000 mark, with the noon closing at $19,500,000, a massive increase of $5,500,000. Other brands such as Golden City and Precious Light are also nearing the $20,000,000 mark. 32-count Silver Moon yarn rose sharply by $4,000,000 to close at $13,000,000.</p>

All grades of 20-count and below have reached unprecedented new highs.</p>
<p>Stimulated by commodity prices outside the exchange, the cotton cloth market has experienced a sharp rise. Credit conditions have generally loosened, and there is a widespread belief that the future is optimistic, causing market sentiment to fluctuate. Holders are adopting a wait-and-see approach and are unwilling to sell, creating a situation where demand exceeds supply in the market. The closing gains were tremendous, and prices were further increased after the close.</p>
<p>Leading fine cloth rose directly from $285,000 to $335,000, then quickly fell to $274,500, with the noon closing recovering to $325,000. In the afternoon, as it was the weekend, the market stopped trading, but over-the-counter trading surged to $400,000.</p>

Because the time for collection and settlement of notes by trading houses was advanced, the morning session trading hours were adjusted from 8:30 AM to 10:30 AM starting yesterday.</p>
<h3>Report of US Gold Transported to Shanghai Cannot Be Confirmed</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Regarding yesterday's report that a large shipment of gold owned by the country had been transported by air from the United States to Shanghai, the reporter confirmed with the head of the bank's business bureau yesterday. Mr. Lin replied, "I am not in a position to comment on this report." The reporter further asked whether the gold market would be expanded and reorganized, and Mr. Lin also replied, "I have not heard of this report either."</p>
<h3>Market Ramblings</h3>
<p>Spectator</p>
<p>Comprehensive Price Increases; Numerous Arbitrage Methods</p>
<p>All markets experienced comprehensive price increases yesterday.</p>
<p>The increase rates for gold and US dollars were moderate, while the prices of general commodities surged rapidly, with soybean oil and rice flour leading the way. Timber, hardware, and cotton yarn rose particularly sharply. The price increases for soap and cigarettes exceeded all previous records. Everywhere, there was a chorus of enthusiastic price increases. Remember our words from yesterday.</p>
<p>In recent years, nine out of ten people in general business have been engaging in arbitrage among gold, banknotes, stocks, and commodities. The arbitrage methods are similar to those in the past, except that there were no set patterns in terms of timing; it was all about adapting to the situation. Now, there is an implicit schedule in place, constantly repeating itself.</p>
<p>To list this schedule, we can provide a few examples. For instance, dividing each month into four weeks: A, B, C, and D, in sequence. This leads to arbitrage involving silver dollars and short-term interest, gold and banknotes and products from our own factory, and raw materials and our own factory's stock.</p>
<p>First, let's consider the arbitrage involving silver dollars and short-term interest:</p>
<p>In weeks A and C, silver dollars are released to earn short-term interest. In weeks B and D, the interest is collected and used to buy back silver dollars. We are currently in week B, and silver dollars are jumping dramatically. This type of arbitrage is highly relevant.</p>
<p>Next, let's consider the arbitrage involving gold and banknotes and products from our own factory, which is a way to prepare for employee salaries and cash flow:</p>
<p>In weeks A and C, gold and banknotes are purchased. In weeks B and D, products from our own factory are sold. Because gold and banknotes are purchased in weeks A and C, the products from our own factory are sold to prepare for salaries and cash flow.</p>
<p>This type of arbitrage has a secret. Let's explain it in three points:</p>
<p>(1) Because gold and banknotes are purchased in weeks A and C, the price of gold and banknotes increases significantly, which fuels the price increases in the commodity market during weeks B and D.</p>
<p>(2) By bidding up the prices of goods in weeks B and D, products from our own factory can be sold at high prices. However, the general increase in commodity prices also increases the cost of living, which is like shooting oneself in the foot.</p>
<p>(3) To offset the self-inflicted wound, the gold and banknotes purchased in weeks A and C are used to make up for this loss, and raw materials can also be replenished during weeks A and C.</p>
<p>Let's also consider the arbitrage involving raw materials and our own factory's stock, which is a way to adjust between gold and banknotes and products from our own factory; it can be said to be arbitrage within arbitrage.</p>
<p>Generally:</p>
<p>(1) In weeks A and C, gold and banknotes are bought, and shares of our own factory are sold.</p>
<p>(2) In weeks B and D, products from our own factory are sold, and raw materials are bought.</p>
<p>(3) In weeks A and C, products from our own factory are sold, and shares of our own factory are bought.</p>
<p>(4) In weeks B and D, shares of our own factory are sold, and raw materials are bought.</p>
<p>The specific changes depend on the situation. But there is one important characteristic: gold and banknotes and shares of our own factory are placed in opposing positions and handled flexibly.</p>
<p>Products from our own factory and shares of our own factory are placed in complementary or mutually restrictive positions and handled accordingly. The purchase of raw materials is placed on the utilization of other people's capital and only listed in the arbitrage transactions for timing purposes.</p>
<p>However, such arbitrage is based on the premise of "national prosperity and people's security". In the present situation, no one can say what changes will occur after a single night's sleep. Therefore, long-term and short-term strategies must be skillfully managed. Take care of yourselves.</p>

<h3>A Division A Football Match: Railway Defeats Ching Wu in a One-Sided Game</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In the second-round match of the Division A football league between Railway and Ching Wu, held at Yiyuan at 3:30 PM yesterday, Railway defeated Ching Wu 4-1 in a one-sided game. Railway scored three goals in the first half, while Ching Wu did not score. Fan attendance was poor, with fewer than 2,000 spectators.</p>
<p>Although the Ching Wu youngsters fought bravely and diligently, they lacked experience and skill. They missed scoring opportunities, and their weak defense was a major problem. Railway won easily in the first half, scoring three goals in the first fifteen minutes. The offensive slowed down slightly in the second half, and they scored one more to make it 4-0. Ching Wu finally scored a penalty kick in the last few minutes to break the goose egg, ending the game 4-1.</p>

In the 17th minute, Cao Liming crossed, Lu Qingxiang darted in, Chen Huimin came out of the goal to meet him, and Xiao Liuzi headed the ball into the empty net, scoring the first goal, 1-0. Ching Wu counterattacked, Fan Benjun went deep along the side, and Yue Renxiao blocked it into a corner kick. Fan Benjun took the corner, which landed in a good spot, but Wu Jingren was a step too slow, missing it by a hair's breadth. Soon after, Ching Wu attacked again, and Wu Jingren's shot hit Liao Xiong's hand, who caught it cleanly. Railway's Sen Dianyi ignited the fire on the sidelines, passing into the center, Lu Qingxiang headed it on, and Qu Xigen flashed in and headed it in, 2-0. In a short while, Lin Yuyang feinted again, dribbled past Huang Lipu, and passed it to the front of the goal. Qu Xigen stepped up, sending the ball into the net, ending the first half with Railway leading by three goals. After a short break, the game resumed, with Railway's Qu Xigen substituted by Fei Chunlin. Railway continued to press hard, and Fei Chunlin crossed the ball, which Xiao Liuzi headed into the net, but it was ruled offside. The two sides fought hard, and the stalemate lasted for a long time. In the 23rd minute, Lin Dianyi seized an opportunity to lob the ball, and Xiao Ziwen headed it in, 4-0. After that, Railway did not press further, and Ching Wu desperately attacked. Railway retreated to defend, and Gao Baozheng fouled in the penalty area in the 38th minute. Wu Jingren took the penalty kick, scoring and breaking the goose egg. As the sun set, the final whistle blew, and Railway defeated Ching Wu 4-1.</p>

<h3>Post-Match Commentary on the Railway vs. Jing Wu Game</h3>
<p>Prior to the match between the Railway team and the Jing Wu team, it was widely predicted that the Railway team would win. However, the young players of the Jing Wu team are full of vigor, and their fighting strength should not be underestimated. Early in the match, they managed to force a draw against the Qing Bai team, but their weakness lies in their lack of experience. Their performance is sometimes exceptionally good, while at other times it falls far below par. If their performance is consistently up to par, it will not be difficult for them to become an ironclad army in the future. In yesterday's match, the young Jing Wu players got off to a good start, but after losing three goals in the first half, their morale collapsed, and they could not muster any further energy. In the first goal, Lu Qingxiang headed the ball into the net, due to Yu Qi and Huang Lifu's lack of defense, and Chen Huimin's eagerness to rush out, leaving an open goal. In the second goal, Huang Lifu lingered too long in the penalty area, allowing Lin Dianyi to steal the ball and cross it, which Qu Xigen took advantage of. The third goal was similar to the first two, all caused by mistakes on the part of Jing Wu, allowing the Railway forwards to seize the opportunity to attack and score. Only the fourth goal, where Lin Dianyi crossed the ball and Xiao Ziwen headed it towards the left side of the goal, was one of the most beautiful scenes in the entire match.</p>
<p>It is said that most of the Jing Wu players had just participated in the track and field meet and were exhausted, which affected their fighting spirit. Yu Qi, the backbone of the Jing Wu team, on whom they rely as their impregnable fortress, is a leading track and field athlete at Daxia University. He arrived to play in the match showing signs of fatigue, which dampened the morale of the entire team. Goalkeeper Chen Huimin still seemed restless and distracted. Gao Zhiwen was better. Huang Lifu lingered too long with the ball, which is a major taboo for inside defenders. Chen Zhigang is improving daily, and both wings, Fang Renqiu and Fan Benjun, posed a threat. Fang Renqiu's right-footed cut shot, although it did not break through the enemy's goal, was enough to frighten Liao Xiong. Center forward Wu Jingren, facing national player Gao Baozheng, was forced to become useless. He could only hope for the goal.</p>
<p>Qu Xigen of the Railway team put in a particularly strong performance, scoring two goals on his own, which is commendable. Although his face was bruised and swollen from a collision, he left behind a glorious page, which he will surely savor in retrospect. Gao Baozheng, sitting in the center, made the young Jing Wu players retreat. Lu Bingsheng was sturdy and good at fighting, mowing down all who stood in his way. Cao Liming worked tirelessly. The reason why the Railway team was able to maintain its advantage throughout the match was that its defensive line was particularly strong, making it difficult to distinguish between them. From this, it can be seen that a strong defensive line makes it easier to break through the opponent's defense and achieve victory, and its importance cannot be ignored. Goalkeeper Liao Xiong was agile and repeatedly saved dangerous shots. Wu Jiabang, reassigned as an inside defender, was also quite impressive. Yue Renxiao's courage was as good as ever. On the forward line, Xiao, Lu, and Zhang were the most outstanding of the three musketeers. Zhang Jie's darting shots had the flavor of Han Longzhang. Xiao Ziwen paved the way and sought opportunities, and Lu Qingxiang threaded the needle, all demonstrating the power of the three center forwards. Lin Dianyi was good at concealing his weaknesses, always passing the ball to the center and not attempting to cut in. Facing Yu Qi, the exhausted Jing Wu stalwart, he was unable to stop the central breakthrough attack, which made him particularly useful. Fei Chunlin was not used to playing wing forward, so on several occasions, at critical moments in front of the goal, he kicked the ball wildly in an unknown direction. However, with his physique, speed, and kicking ability, he is capable of playing wing forward, and if he trains specifically as a wing forward in the future, he may achieve something.

<h3>Officialese</h3>
<p>— Qu Chen</p>
<p>I haven't been out for a long time. A few days ago, I went to the North Station for some matters concerning my hometown. I saw two public notices at the station, which I found quite thought-provoking.</p>
<p>One of them, posted at the gate of the North Station, was a lost-and-found notice from the Jinghu Line Police Department. It roughly stated: "Approximately 1,000 gold yuan notes have been found. The owner may submit a written statement clarifying the location and time of the loss, as well as the exact amount, and after providing a guarantor, may claim the item at this office." The date was March of the 38th year [of the Republic], with the specific day left blank. We will disregard this for now and focus on the fact that it has been several days since March. I wonder: if this notice was posted at the beginning of March, then 1,000 or so gold yuan notes, with this set of claiming procedures, would not be too unprofitable. However, if it was posted in late March, then the Police Department would be making too much of a fuss. What is a mere thousand gold yuan notes? Why bother posting such a large notice and requiring such complicated procedures for claiming? I believe that even if the owner actually saw it, he would not be moved to such a degree. Perhaps, on the contrary, he would give a knowing smile, expressing his apology for failing to live up to the good intentions of the Police Department.</p>
<p>The other notice stated that passengers needed a vaccination certificate to purchase tickets. When I saw it, I couldn't help but rejoice, because I had just been vaccinated a few days earlier, and I wouldn't be rushed at the last minute. However, when I handed in my vaccination certificate and the fare together at the window, I never expected that the clerk inside would throw it out dismissively. I noticed that other passengers didn't have this requirement at all and were able to buy tickets as usual. I suddenly realized that no wonder the vaccination stations outside were so empty. I felt a little ashamed and too clueless.</p>
<p>These two notices were deeply imprinted in my mind. I thought to myself: rather than being called public notices, they are simply decorations for the North Station. However, I was a little hesitant, because they are, after all, official notices.</p>
<h3>The Best Cake</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jin Daqin</p>
<p>When I was a child, our family was often so poor that we had no food at all. But we still lived happily, because Mother always told us with deep conviction that we would eat very well tomorrow.</p>
<p>One winter, my father was working away from home for a long time, and my mother worked in a textile factory. She worked the night shift, so she could still take care of some family affairs during the day. Every evening, when she went to work at the factory, she would always leave a note telling us what food was in the house and how we should handle it.</p>
<p>At that time, Mary (my sister) had already graduated from junior high school and was working at a telephone company. After school, I also went to work at a transportation company for a few hours, where my brother Tite also worked. Only my younger brother George was often at home. We often felt that our family was too fragmented, and it was rare for the siblings to have the chance to meet. Only on Sundays did Mother bring the family back together.</p>
<p>One day, the note that Mother left read: "There are four eggs in the cupboard, and you can each eat one. Tomorrow is my birthday, and we will celebrate it well."</p>
<p>George was the first to see the note, and he was already asleep when Tite and I returned. He wrote on the note: "Let Mary eat my egg, I'm not hungry."</p>
<p>Tite and I looked at each other. Tite finally said, "I don't feel hungry either." "In any case, give it to Mary, - that's right!" He wrote this sentence after George's, but didn't finish it. So I wrote, "I'm not hungry either."</p>
<p>We were all asleep when Mary came back. The next morning, Mother's face looked very bad, and she was always holding the note. "I remember, I told you each to eat one."</p>
<p>We were all silent. Mother turned to Mary, who had just come in from outside. "I'm very surprised that you ate all the eggs! I'm really sad that you're so selfish!"</p>
<p>Mary lowered her head. Mother continued harshly, "Did you drop all the eggs? Did you? All the eggs in the cupboard are gone!"</p>
<p>Mary nodded.</p>
<p>Mother sighed. "But at least we have a hearty breakfast to eat. I told a food shop to send some food when I got home." She hurried to the kitchen.</p>
<p>After a while, Mother came back out, holding a very beautiful cake. "What is this?" she asked confusedly.</p>
<p>"This is a cake, Mother," Mary raised her head. "I made it last night after I got back, and I dropped four eggs. Because today is Mother's birthday."</p>
<p>Mother's tears fell, and she hugged Mary in her arms. "Child, God bless you!"</p>
<p>We happily ate the cake, although it was small and not baked properly, but we felt that it was the best cake we had ever eaten in our lives.</p>
<h3>Taicheng Road, Taipei, by Chen Jishuo</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shizhao</p>
<p>I can speak of the city,</p>
<p>Coming again, the meaning is clearer.</p>
<p>Four corner watchtowers, surrounding tracks,</p>
<p>Like this for fifty years.</p>
<p>The deceased are mistaken, looking at the green leaves through winter,</p>
<p>The wilderness spreads the ground,</p>
<p>The old rivers and mountains, not my land,</p>
<p>How can they become different?</p>
<p>The sounds of teaching and home have ceased,</p>
<p>Alas, taking the capital for a long time,</p>
<p>The borderlands are difficult to govern.</p>
<p>The rivers and mountains on paper,</p>
<p>Wen Luo in dreams,</p>
<p>Who understands the deep meaning of the poet?</p>
<p>Miles away from home,</p>
<p>Facing the pomegranate of a full valley,</p>
<p>Red feelings are only beautiful.</p>
<p>Hate the cuckoo again,</p>
<p>The sound reaches the ear on a clear night.</p>
<h3>Responding to Mr. Xingyan's Poem, Respectfully Following Yuanjun's Rhyme</h3>
<p>— Chen Jishuo</p>
<p>Singing while wandering has already exhausted me,</p>
<p>I still don't have a plan to return.</p>
<p>Spring is deep in the island country,</p>
<p>The city is full of green,</p>
<p>Secretly regretting that time flows like this.</p>
<p>The prisoner is old,</p>
<p>There are lingering sorrows of separation,</p>
<p>Wanting to bury them without a place,</p>
<p>Looking at the fairy mountains on the sea,</p>
<p>They all seem different in dreams.</p>
<p>Sadly, the clouds and trees are dim,</p>
<p>Asking about the black crow and horse horns,</p>
<p>Who inquires about Wu Ji?</p>
<p>The wild goose foot sinks the letter,</p>
<p>The knife ring breaks the dream,</p>
<p>The crying pigeon only stirs people's minds.</p>
<p>My home is thousands of miles away,</p>
<p>I guess the flowers blooming on the southern path,</p>
<p>Should also be like brocade.</p>
<p>At this moment, climbing the building,</p>
<p>Only letting tears fall in the wind.</p>
<h3>You? Wait a Moment!</h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<h3>Talking About the "Do Not Engage" Sign</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiqu</p>
<p>Life is often unsatisfactory in eight or nine out of ten cases. I want to hear news of peace talks but can't, and I don't want to hear the sound of cannons, but the sound of cannons is getting louder and louder on the north bank. In great distress, I can't help but think of the rules of engagement in old novels.</p>
<p>In old novels, when both sides are at war, before the battle begins, Party A must first send a "challenge letter." If Party B does not intend to engage, they can hang up a "do not engage" sign, and Party A must not move its troops. I think, why don't we also learn from our ancient predecessors, make a "do not engage" sign, and hang it in the middle of the Yangtze River, in order to seek peace first and then talk? Wouldn't that be very good?</p>
<p>I remember at the beginning of the War of Resistance, a friend who was in charge of military supplies told me that a rifle bullet cost four jiao at the time. A direct-fire artillery shell cost 25 silver dollars. A cannon shell cost more than 120 yuan. By extrapolation, how much would a 500-pound bomb cost? How much would a 9,000-ton cruiser cost? In today's situation where the big heads are over 50,000 and the small heads are over 40,000, how much would the consumption of a bullet and a shell, converted into gold yuan notes, be? And the launch of even a small battle is certainly not something that can be accomplished with a single bullet or shell. So, in a situation where "the artillery fire is intense," imagine how many "four jiao" bullets, how many "25 yuan" and "120 yuan" shells are reduced to nothing in the sound of explosions? As someone who is deeply burdened by the economy, how can I not feel that it is a great pity?</p>
<p>Someone might say: although the consumption of bullets is large, if it leads to the success of the revolution, its cost is a hundred times greater than the loss of bullets. Weighing the pros and cons, this little consumption is nothing.</p>
<p>I say: not so. Although the artillery fire is fierce, in fact, not many people are hit. Machine guns rattle and cannons boom, but if every gun and every bullet could hit its target, the Chinese people would have been nearly wiped out by now since the War of Resistance. The pity is that most of these valuable bullets are wasted in barren fields, riverbanks, forests, and at the foot of mountains, to no avail. As for the small portion of bullets that hit their target, that's even worse. Think about it, those "human wave" components who are killed or injured, who doesn't have parents who have raised them to such a great extent as their treasured child. Now they are sacrificed in vain, wasting both bullets and lives, a double loss, gaining nothing. Isn't that even more regrettable?</p>
<p>Moreover, although peace talks are secret, they have in fact already begun. If they succeed, needless to say, there will always be a resolution in the future, and there is no need to sacrifice piecemeal at this time. In fact: whether it is the National Army or the Communist Army, they are all Chinese "people" with yellow skin and black hair; whether it is bullets or cannons, they are all the sweat and blood of the common people. When peace cannot be achieved, the common people have no power to stop the war; but now that both sides have started talking, can't we, the common people, persuade both sides to put down their knives and guns in the Yangtze River and first call a truce?</p>
<h3>Strange Wills</h3>
<p>— Sang</p>
<p>A British furniture merchant wrote in his will: give each staff without a beard fifty-five pounds, but each staff with a beard, give only twenty-five pounds.</p>
<p>An American wealthy merchant who hated slender women, wrote in his will that each daughter could get a heritage proportionate to their weight.</p>
<p>A British lawyer, donated all of his heritage to charities, but left five shillings to his younger brother, because this was his last time supplying him with alcohol money.</p>
<p>A wealthy man who was addicted to alcohol when he was alive, donated his heritage to those singles who were willing to protect the bottle caps he had accumulated.</p>
<p>And another wealthy man's will, wrote: each relative who did not come to the will reading, can divide the heritage evenly.</p>
<h3>Cosmic Phenomena</h3>
<p>— Cang Yi</p>
<p>In Huangshan Tangkou's hot spring, one spring eye's water is cold, another spring eye's water is hot, like a faucet of cold/hot water in a bathtub. There is a fragrant smell in the water, very similar to Qinan fragrance, because it is a cinnabar spring.</p>
<p>There is an American artist, who likes to make extremely tiny artworks. He recently completed a winter oil painting, the area is only one-sixty-fifth of a square inch, and it was drawn with a hair.</p>
<h3>The Captain's Housekeeping Notes</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>A captain's wife went to visit a warship, and saw that at around 10:00 AM, the ship had already been cleaned up, only two hours after breakfast. At a glance, she was shocked by the sailors' speed of doing things.</p>
<p>The captain told her: cooking, cleaning and laundry on a warship, like engineering and artillery, goes through precise studies, and methods and steps are designed by experts.</p>
<p>After some time, the captain was transferred to a department to work. After a few days, his wife injured her ankle and went to the hospital. So he took care of the household affairs himself, governing the housework according to the Navy's methods.</p>
<p>In order to scientifically plan the household affairs, the captain counted the time his neighbors spent on household affairs everyday. Among the eleven housewives, the average time spent on each household affair every week was as follows: cooking, eleven hours twelve minutes; cleaning, fourteen hours; ironing clothes, six hours; washing dishes, eight hours ten minutes; laundry (using machine), forty-five minutes; shopping, three hours.</p>
<p>This means that an average of more than six hours is spent every day. According to the Navy's standards, this is too much time. According to the Navy's methods, he must spend three hours every day on dealing with these household affairs.</p>
<p>So, he allocated the time like this:</p>
<p>6:00-8:00 AM every day: laundry, ironing, preparing breakfast, while preparing lunch and dinner. Cleaning the house, eating breakfast, changing clothes. Every morning, he cleaned a room particularly clean, and casually mopped the other rooms.</p>
<p>At 8:30 AM, he rushed to the Navy department to work. When he got home in the evening, he heated up the dinner that had been cooked in the morning (this emergency method is not used by general housewives), the bowls and plates were washed, and the kitchen was tidied up. He then spent half an hour making a "daily plan", determining what household affairs to do tomorrow, when to do them, and how to do them. This system is the soul of Navy efficiency. At 8:00 PM, everything was finished, and the captain began to rest.</p>
<p>Cleaning work can also become easier if done separately. For example, wipe one or two windows every day, wash the bathroom floor every Monday and Friday. If each family sets up a plan separately, the time of family operation can certainly be reduced.</p>
<p>Although, this matter happened in America, they have machines that can share the labor, but this method and spirit, can also be for our reference. Nowadays, when general housewives feel the annoyance of hiring employees, when it is necessary to operate all household affairs themselves, if they can take a shortcut, if they can set up a plan first, conduct two kinds of work at the same time, and use all kinds of labor, the husband and children both participate in a part of household operation, then it may be possible to make the household chores become more interesting work.</p>
