<h3>首都充滿團結空氣　和談內容正研討中　孫科抵京張羣程潛即東來</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕李代總統邀集中樞及地方要員來京舉行之重要會商，事實上，殆已開始。上海和平代表團廿七日由平來京及孫科院長廿八日由穗返抵南京後，此項會商益趨具體化。一俟張羣·程潛一日到達參與談話，卽可獲得結論。接近李代總統之人士，廿八日力闢召開會議之說，惟對會商已在進行一事，未予否認。據稱：此爲李代總統視事及出巡後邀各地首長來京談談，並無會議之形式，且所談內容亦極廣泛。連日報載代總統官邸之重要會議，並無其事，有之亦卽各要員之偶然會集談話。另據有關方面透露：目前政府之主要問題有二：（一）爲如何增强內部之團結，俾意見一致，力量集中；（二）爲如何與中共開始談判，以期達成全面和平之目的。關於前者，李代總統前南巡已有重大收獲，此次各要員集京，交換意見，更可獲得一致之主張。政府內部團結一致，對於和談，亦有絕大之重要性。中共廣播曾一再提及政府內部意見之不同，廿七日更有所謂「李宗仁·孫科對於國民黨領導　的爭奪戰」之廣播，至此已不攻自破。關於後者，邵力子氏以私人資格參加上海和平代表團赴平，所得對政府之決策，良多裨益。正式談判開始在卽，政府似不能不有充分之準備也。事實上此項會商業已開始，李代總統曾於日前兩度邀請監察院長于右任長談，先就大局決策，向此黨國元老諮詢意見，立法院長童冠賢，行政院副院長吳鐵城亦均曾數度晋謁談商。廿七日上海和平代表團返京後，至廿八日晚，李代總統已與邵力子氏單獨談話三次，廿八日晚宴後，李代總統獨留何應欽，白崇禧談話至深夜。邵氏所報吿之中共能度及毛澤東氏之長兩，李代總統均與何·白二氏詳加研討。廿八日孫科抵京後，下午五時卽赴李代總統官邸晋謁，張治中氏亦在座，長談至七時始辭出。預計張羣。程潛抵京後，此項會商當加緊進行，冀於三二日內獲得具體結論。邵力子由平歸來後，政府將如何促成和談正式開始，亦將於此項會商中作最後決定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕消息靈通方面人士傳聞和平代表團返京時，確已揚有中共所提之先決倏件數項，聞其中有以漢口西安兩市爲要挾者，卽漢口西安必先歸中共「解放」。觀察家認爲果如是，則對李代總統之誠意未免過於苛刻，因華中軍事爲李氏與白崇禧可親自指揮之要衝地段，自不易輕於放棄也。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿八日電〕廿八日氣候惡劣，張羣改一日飛京。</p>
<p>〔本報長沙廿八日電〕程潛原定廿八日乘張羣由渝過長之自强號專機飛京，因長布家山機塲廿七日傍晚有軍用機一架，因油料不足迫降，路道受損，臨時不能降落，致未能與張偕行，程氏擬改赴衡飛京。</p>
<h3>雙方和談人選內定　中共代表名單政府已獲知　但在發表前不欲有所透露</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕和談開始有望，一般咸予注視；尤其重要者，爲雙方進行談判之代表人選，中共方面人選業已擬定，政府人士亦已獲知其名單，惟在中共正式發長之前，不願有所透露。至政府力面代表是否仍卽以前所發表之邵力子·張治中·黃紹竑·錘天心四氏擔任，亦在當局考慮之中。有資格人士透露：此項人選，或略有變動，其人數殆亦略爲增加。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕和平代表團顏江章邵等四人，廿八日在京續受各方熱烈之歡迎。和平代表團下榻之中國旅行社之首都飯店，廿八日上下午均訪客盈門，對四和平老人之辛勞，表示慰問。上午居正·自崇禧·黃紹竑·甘家馨·黃宇人等先後往訪，正午張治中前往訪晤，談話近一小時，下午復有行政院副院長吳鐵城·黃伯度及立監委等十餘人，中午代表團應立監兩院院長童冠賢于右任宴，晚應行政院正副院長孫科吳鐵城兩氏聯合歡宴。</p>

<h3>對共區郵運週內可恢復</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿八日電〕顏惠慶之代表團與中共領袖會談之第一實際結果，將爲對北平空運之恢復。據悉：共黨所作讓步之一，爲准許中央航空公司不久卽開始郵運，客運留待日後恢復。至少在目前，將不准其他航空公司飛機赴北平。據自非常可靠方面獲悉，中國航空公司及民航空運大隊在目前將不准飛往北平，因該公司等有「美帝國主義者」之投資。中央航空公司消息稱：北平郵運將於三天至七天內恢復。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國共全面通郵問題，自經本市和平代表團赴平接洽後，原則上已徵得共方同意，至於各項技術上問題，共方希此間派員去平直接商洽，現郵政總局正考慮人選中，一俟決定，卽可啓程北飛。</p>
<h3>共黨圖控制台灣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿八日廣播：香港訊此間消息靈通之合灣人士表示，將來國共和談時，中共必將要求管理台灣。台灣現有共黨約一萬人，正在從事種種活動，要求管理該島。該台灣人士稱：台灣共黨女領袖謝雪紅（譯音）已赴華北接洽。此間與合灣獨立運動有關之人士稱：最近有「白俄」約二百人自華赴台，渠等表面上爲無國籍雞民，但衆信其中必有蘇聯之秘密工作人員。該方面人士謂全台六百五十萬人民中，對國共雙方，皆無好感，但渠等亟盼美國明確表示其對台政策。該人士稱：台人鞦迎美國人士所表示國民黨人不應至台灣避雞之意見，因台灣之地位如何，至今尙無正式決定也。該人士又稱：如共黨控制台灣，則必將引起一九四七年二月二十八日反對國民黨暴動之相似事件。</p>

<h3>立法院復會兩大責任　促進和平革新政治　今例會停開四日舉行第二次會　孫科將出席補行報告施政方針</h3>
<p>〔本報南以廿八日電〕立法院第三會期，廿八日晨依照憲法之規定，如期在京復會開會前抵京報到之立委共計二一一人，出席第一次會談者一七八人，會中未討論任何議案，以待其他各地趕到參加。廿八日晨天氣晴和，陽光普照，寂寥兩閱月之國民大會堂，復呈喧擾氣象，各委員以係本年首次集會，紛紛及時出席，並與一別兩月之同仁寒暄問候。上午九時三十五分開會，僅以廿分鐘時間完成報吿事項，童院長主席，並致詞，約十分鐘，以促進和平，革新政治兩點作爲本屆會議之重大責任。此外，僅有秘書處宣讀第二會期第卅三次會議紀錄，無異議通過。童院長致詞後，報吿本院依照過去規定，每星期二五各集會一次，此次會議爲附合憲法規定，提前至廿八日舉行，現接重吿，各地委員均在途中，三月三日之例會日期可否停開一次，以待各同仁趕到，會衆鼓掌，至九時五十五分散會，一日晨之例會，決定停開，程序委會則定一日土午十時開會，商討第二次會議議程。據悉：截至廿八日止。各委員尙無議案提出，僅政府方面已提出法律案數件</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕立法院定四日舉行第二次會議，因孫科院長已由穗抵京，屆時將由孫氏出席補行報吿施政方針。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕立法院長童冠賢，廿八日晨在立法院第三會期復會之第一次會議席上致詞稱：今天春光明媚，本院舉行第三會期第一次會議，象徵國家前途之光明祥瑞。本院休會以後，迄今已有兩月，在此兩月中間，蔣總統爲倡導和平，毅然引退，李代總統爲促進和平，膺任艱鉅，這是國家存亡的一個轉捩點。在此時期，立法院依法復會，我們責任的重大，人民希望的殷切，當可不言而喻。今日的世紀，爲人民的世紀，只有順從人民的意志，國家才有出路，只有發揮人民的力量，政府才有力量。現在人民所希望的是什麼？無疑的是和平，是政治革新。所謂和平，並不是停止目前的小流血、準備未來的大流血，所謂政治革新，也不是政府人事上的更動，而是建樹確能代表人民爲人民謀福利的廉能政治制度。如何使自由民主進步能得到合理的保障，如何使國家走上長治久安的途程，這是今日歷史所賦予今日政治家的使命，也是我們立法院所肩負的重大責任。就兄弟個人的看法，本期立法院會議，有與前兩次所不同者，一是在今天人民迫切需要和平解除倒縣之情况下，進行國家大事的討論，時間不容許我們討論枝節問題。二是這次開會的議題，似乎是政治性多於法律性的，需要我們集中精力，硏討國家最迫切需要的幾個大問題。例如如何促進全面和平，如何確定今後施政方針，如能增進行政效能，如何穩定金融財政，如何改善軍民生活等等。我們同仁來自全國各角落，各階層，對於人民的企求，國家的需要，都有極深刻的認識。我相信，用我們集體的智慧，冷靜的思考，精誠的團結，必能表達民意，督勵政府，扭轉當前的危局，如國家奠定一永久和平的基礎。這是我們同仁共有的認識，也是全國人民的希望，兄弟在今日第一次集會之際，謹貢數言，供全院同仁參考。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州廿八日電〕立法院廿八日在京復會，留穗立委仍堅持反對，大部份主張暫緩復會及採取投票方式決定復會地點，一部份立委之意，倘京方不顧一切，留穗同人卽不惜與之唱「對合戯」，亦有部份立委認爲，只要能使政府早日實現「光榮和平」，則開會時間地點均不成問題。目前留穗立委共有八十餘人，據有資格觀察家稱，彼等雖極力主張在穗復會，但目前復會人數不多，唱「對台戯」之可能甚少。</p>

<p>據悉該機構發動此項計劃，係在一月廿五日中共電台公布四十三名政府方面戰犯名單之後，迨南京實行疏散公敎人員，政府高級官員多離京他去，顏惠慶，邵力子等上海和平代表團北飛，彼等乃益加急進行，採取六個步驟，企圖顚覆國民政府，控制首都，迎接共軍渡江，佔領京滬一綫，然後進而達到攫取政機之目的。其所定之六個步驟，據被捕者供述，爲：（一）發動預伏政府內部之軍警憲諜報份子，佔領南京飛機塲，車站，輪埠，電訊設備之交通樞紐及京滬杭國道之橋樑，（二）監禁在京李代總統以下之重要黨政軍首要，控制所有重要機關，隔絕首都與外間之一切聯繫，（三）分化地方武力，造成京滬杭無政府狀態，（四）糾集反政府各地下份子，迎接共軍渡江，先行佔領京滬杭沿綫，（五）擾亂後方秩序，造成恐怖狀態，分軍佔領各地，（六）使各方失却聯絡，乘機假發號令，達到攫取整個政權之最後目的。政府方面於破獲此一重大陰謀後，一因全國人民切盼和平，深恐發表後影響和談前途，二以此一問諜案中牽涉者太廣，爲免罪犯漏網計，故最初嚴禁外洩。據謂主持此項陰謀者，除國民黨革命委員會及其他反政府份子外，尙有潛伏於民意機關以及政府內之少數高級聯部。</p>
<p>首都及上海之治安機關共同破獲此一驚人暴動大陰謀案，其經過頗爲曲折費力，猶如偵探小說。由一絲微細綫索，經縝密佈置，派遣反間人員，深入對方之核心組織，偵獲全部計劃，而始發動迅雷不及掩耳之逮捕工作，將主持及參預人物一一加以扣禁。至被捕確切人數，官方迄今獨守緘默，但外問傳說已達一二十人以上。</p>
<p>第一個被捕者</p>
<p>政府之開始拘捕工作，大致係在二月十二三日，迨至十七日首都方面之消息靈通人士業已傳出該案之大要，十八日聯合社南京電訊首先發表東北籍松江省國大女代表秦秀卿接見該社記者，謂其夫孟士衡在上海被捕後，渠本人亦於二月十四日起在京寓被政府之特務人員軟禁。渠今雖不能爲其夫之政治活動負資，然已失自由而遭軟禁。據聯合社記者稱：其後秦秀卿之友人三名造寓訪問，皆被逮捕，其中之一爲國大代表該社並謂該社記者訪問秦秀卿寓所時，有一便衣人員在塲，渠證實係奉命來此負資救禁秦安士者。記者與秦會談時，監視者亦在旁靜聽。據稱：秦已設法私自送出一信，該信係呈李代總統者，對其遭遇有所陳述。秦秀卿並稱：其夫孟土衡於被捕後已由滬解京，仍被拘禁。（下文轉入第二版）</p>

<h3>從莫須名君助學談起</h3>
<p>本報卅八年度春季讀者助學金，預定目標五百萬元，勸募了許多時日，僅僅募得三分之一弱。這固然是我們的勞力不够，但也是由於時局動盪，人心不寗的緣故。我們正在準備即照募得之數，緊縮分配的時候，不料有讀者「莫須名」先生，慨然捐助一百萬元，凑足預定數額的二分之一。繼而復承他親自經募二百五十萬元，完成了本屆讀者助學金的預定數額。並聞新聞報日前受裕華烟公司委託舉辦「紅高樂」助學金，名單揭曉，而所取數額不及申請者之數額，莫須名先生亦曾捐助二百萬元，使及格淸寒學生八百餘名，均能獲得繼續求學之機會。這種熱心助學，嘉息淸寒學子的義舉，見之於今日的上海，而尤其爲善不願居名的精神，眞是空谷足昔，格外値得社會人士的敬佩。</p>
<p>上海雖是稱全國的經濟中心，但近三年來，一面受戰亂影饗，各地游資都向本市匯集，另一方面又因通貨惡性膨脹，造成畸形發展，貧者愈貧，富者愈富，使財富集中於少數人，而這些少數人，又大半抱着亂世心理，沉緬於個人享受，但求利己，不惜損人，甚至拔一毛而利天下不爲。我們只看年來各項社會救濟捐款，如救濟特捐，冬令救濟金，以及最近的空中勸募獎學金等，勸募的結果，多半不能達到預定目標。在這種惡劣墮落的社會風氣中，莫須名先生竟能一再贊助助學捐款，便更顧得難能可貴。本報稱彼爲「助學老人」，實在當之無愧了。</p>
<p>據聞這一位自號「莫須名」的先生，在抗戰期間，亦嘗以「苦齊主人」名統經常捐款助學。照他自己的聲明說：「幼年失學，深有同感；特在滬甬等地創辦義校多所，廣收免費學子，總覺粥少僧多，難如心願，亦惟有竭其能力行之而已」。這是說他興學助學的動機，由於深感失學的痛苦，因而推己及人，在使淸寒學子可以安心攻讀他絕不是爲的沽名釣譽，也沒有其作用；他純粹是基於人飢己飢，人溺己溺的心理，對於失學靑年的一種廣大的同情。</p>
<p>本來周情心就是自私心的反面，是人類對於社會創造力的源泉。孔孟所講的「仁」，墨子所說的「兼愛」，基督所提倡的「博愛」，以及釋迦所闡述的「大慈大悲」，都是以對於人類乃至對於衆生的同情心爲出發點，引仲擴大而建立的崇高的信念。他們和他們的信徒，爲了這種信念的實踐，小則犧牲一己所有，用以濟助別人，大則殺身成仁，捨身取義。摩頂放踵，粉身碎骨，在所不辭。古聖先賢有這種精神，宗敎信徒有這種精神，革命和抗戰的先烈也同樣有這種精神。可是現在的社會，尤其是今日浮華醉迷的上海，偏偏缺少的也就是這種捨己爲人克己利他的精神！</p>
<p>道德因爲時間和空間的不同，往往沒有固定的標準。然而却有一個相同的基本原則，是古今中外共同一致的，它是給予，而決不是奪取；是布施，而決不是佔有；是助人，而不是肥已。唯其如此，纔能得到心境上的寗靜和光明。所謂一爲善最樂」，所謂「助人爲快樂之本」，所謂「不住相布施，紹德無量」，就是這個基本原則的說明。穆勒也說過：「要求幸福的人，必須把他的心安放在自身幸福以外的某一種對象上，即安放在人類的改善事業上」。所以簡單的說，人們想獲得幸福，必須犧牲自己的私人幸福，促進社會大衆的公共幸福，乃至增進十方世界一切有情的共同幸兩，然後纔能有眞的幸福。</p>
<p>但是再回過頭來看看我們的社會，財富集中在少數人的手裏，而形成了亂世特有的所關「豪富」。他們用投機取巧的方法剝奪了大多數平民的、活、人皆飢寒，他們却豐衣足食；人皆救死不暇，他　却縱情聲色，他們不但沒有社會觀念和國家意議，連對人類的基本同情也喪失了，更何論對於一切衆生？莫須名先生，爲警而不願居其名，經我們多方的探訪，原亦不過是一位級商而已。只因爲幼年身受失學痛苦，便能看淸別人的失學痛苦，於是就一心濟助失學靑年，推而至於凡有窮而無吿之徒，只要他知道而力所能及，沒有不樂於幫助，我們想想今日的富豪權貴，往日都曾直接或間接得到過政府的扶持或社會的幫助，甚而至於還享受過國家特殊的恩渥，他們之所以能有目前的地位，也可以說是國家和人民給他們的機會。然而時至今日，大衆的生活陷於這樣的苦難，國家命運遭逢到空前的險阨，却沒有聽到他們動一點惻隱之心，也沒有看到他們有什麼下式輸財的表現。以彼例此，淸夜自問，他們能不愧死！</p>
<p>在此本報本屆春季讀者助學金勸募工作結束之日，敬向捐款諸君曁莫須名先生致謝，更希望從此大家推廣同情，熱心社會救濟，進而踴躍解囊，捐獻國家，同舟共濟，渡此空前的難關。</p>
<h3>蘇北共軍逐步南移　揚州附近集結三萬餘人　津浦正面陳毅部主力亦正水陸並進</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕據此間獲悉；揚州附近共軍雲集，除原有土共三千人不計外，日來已到達揚州仙女廟及宜陵一帶者約三萬人，其後續部隊三萬餘人，正續由淮陰分水陸兩路經高郵寳應南移中。至其番號，據調查係陳毅之第十·十一·十二等縱隊。又由天長至掦州間共軍，調動亦忙。天長及高郵湖西南地區，原駐陳毅部二三九，渤海快速等五個縱隊。</p>

<h3>對北平世界日報被封事　成舍我發表聲明　稱正可堅強為新聞自由苦鬥信念</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕北平世界日報社長成舍我，頃對該報在平被中共軍管會封閉事，發表聲明如左：</p>
<p>「從報載陜北廣播，知余辛勤手創在華北具有悠久歷史之北平世界日報，已於本月廿五日被北平中共軍管會查封，余於去年九月底離平，十二月共軍突攻平津，交通隔絕。共軍入平，留平同人以安全關係，未能自動停判。一月以來，平市秩序漸定，共軍控制全局，已無强令原有報紙「偽裝進步」之必要，故全市報紙數十家逐一被封。而世界日報之軀殼竟獨獲延至最後，此余對中共査封世界日報不特不應表示怨憤，且惟有怪其優異。尤其於封閉一切民營報紙中，獨對世界日報不惜辭費，發表長文廣播，申述若許理由，如此重視世界日報，更令余有不勝受寵若驚之感。</p>
<p>事實非能歪曲</p>
<p>世界日報自民國十三年創刊，數十年間，在任何朝代之下，幾無不遭受迫害。所謂査封，先後已不下數十次，而余個人之被捕下獄，數亦相等，廿六年北平淪陷，報社爲日寇掠奪，及勝利復刊，余於署名之復刊宣言中，曾痛吿國共雙方謂；共產黨若不改變政策，仍如政府所傳，專以殺人放火鬬爭暴動爲能事，則政府用兵無法阻止；若國民黨不能痛切覺悟，澈底改革，而仍蹈故襲常，因循泄沓，貪汚腐敗，則人民革命勢所必至。勝利以來，世界日報之每一主張，卽無不遵此原則出發，卽在今日，對此原則，余仍未能發現應向任何朝代之槍口刺刀下感覺懺悔。如中共認此爲「無黨派的假面具」，則余亦寗願戴此面具以終生。所幸世界日報過去言論，一字一句，公正良善之廣大華北人士，久有定評，初無待余之辯證，亦非任何人所能歪曲。而余於二十餘年前，一介書生，以僅有之數百元極少資金，獨力創辦此報，迄至今日，被中共査封止，能在華北民營報紙中具有廣大規模，擁有廣大讀衆，原因何在，衆所共見。然世界日報不特從未接受任何朝代之任何支持，與其發生任何關係，甚至國民政府統治下各地例有之低利文化貸款，亦向所謝絕。中共所査封之世界日報資產中，每一機器之齒輪，每一鉛版之字粒，胥爲余及數百同人絞腦汁流血汗以獲得。世界日報今雖暫時不能再向華北廣大請衆供獻超然獨立之言論，迅速確實之新聞，但過去數十年來華北廣火讀衆所給予世界日報滋育成長之鼓勵，正可堅强余及無數新聞戰士爲新聞自由繼續苦闘之信念。回憶抗戰時期，不特余之北平世界日報爲敵摧毀，所有由余主辦南京·上海。香港之其他報紙，亦先後胥遭掠奪。漢口·桂林則未及出版卽吿淪陷。而余終於勝利前夕，在重慶復刊世界日報。余深信天地之大，中共能封閉余北平之世界日報，而無法封閉余畢生獻身新聞事業發揮正義抵抗暴力之意志</p>
<p>誣衊無庸辯正</p>
<p>至中共廣播曾指余爲國民黨CC份子，此種惡毒的造謠，不特無庸余一詞辯正，卽作此廣播者，荀不自毀其諜報工作向稱卓絕之驚人成績，則對當前各稱派系情形，及余向不參加任何派系之鐵的事實，稍加思索，亦自必啞然失笑。好在任何朝代，均有其製造專銜，誣衊異已之天賦特權，「國特」「匪諜」，易地皆然。此爲古今中外不易之定律，而在今日爲尤甚。余亦惟有歎息政治道德之愈益衰落而已。」</p>

<p>此外在京被捕者尙有首都中區警察局局長馬廣運，據謂馬係參加暴動企圖以武力捕捉首都警察廳廳長黃珍吾，進而控制首都之人物，現中區警局局長已由首都警察聽副督察長歐陽敬接充。（馬曾揑造黃廳長潛逃在機塲被扣新聞，交由該局勾巡官供給南京人報女記者趙靈鋆，該報不察於一月卅一日刋出「黃廳長開溜失風被部下在機塲　獲」一訊馬目的卽在利用該報以破壞黃廳長名譽，俾使警員因對黃不滿擴大爲請願，甚至罷崗，罷勤等事，以配合此項陰謀，後該巡官亦被捕。）一說被捕人物中尙有目前担任維護治安之少數憲警人員，故關於該項重大陰謀中如何捕捉李代總統等之計劃可謂不僅詳密，且俱平易易行，其初意擬俟第一個步驟完成後，然後再依照上述計劃逐步推進。</p>
<p>繼續偵緝中　又據另一方面宣稱：政府某機關人負在一月前後卽獲悉反政府份子有陰謀暴動企圖，然以所獲材料多屬零碎片斷，不甚完整者，待後政府中之某得力情報人員用盡種種方法，打入此項特務組織，並担任反間工作後，始漸獲端倪，而此項陰謀乃係潛居上海之孟士衡者所主持，爰經千方百計偵得某忠厚長者與孟係屬至交，當由在京之某治安機關請該長者作介紹人，介紹某某爲李代總統代表，擬代表政府與孟士衡商洽國共和談，而在事前以迄於今，該長者旣未知悉孟某已參加此項特務組織，正在從事陰謀顚覆政府之暴動工作，亦未知該李代總代表實際上係政府治安機關所遣派之反間的化裝人物。初，該長者應邀赴南京某治安機關，該機關將召渠之目的吿知後，該長者謂孟士衡是否在京，須調査後，始能獲知究竟，此時某治安機關固早知孟已離京來滬，所苦者係不知其在滬寓址，然爲使該長者不疑有他乃同意由渠調査後再作決定。翌日，該長者復兩，謂孟已去滬，某治安機關乃央渠修函或以長途電話介紹李代總統之代表與孟略談。該長者以事關和談，關係重大，似非渠親往跋涉一行，難以成功，乃決定由該長者親自陪同此李代總統代表來滬。抵滬後，該長者與李代總統代表商定，由渠個人先往孟之寓所，徵得孟士衡同意和談之原則後，再代爲引見。實際上，常該長渚前往孟處時，首都某治安機關在本市治安機關人員協助下，固早已暗中派人尾隨該長者之後，迨該長者與孟洽談終了外出，本市某治安機關人員卽將孟予以逮捕。及該長者返至旅邸，吿李代總統代表謂孟某願意接見時，孟茶被逮之消息亦同時傳至，而該長者不明所以，於返京途中尙再三央請李代總統代表轉請李代總統下令與上海治安機關，予以開釋。由於孟士衡之被捕，此項大暴動之陰謀及其全部計劃，遂全部獲悉，並搜得孟之上級秘密指令，根據此一綫索，又捕獲負責最高決策之五人小組中担任組織宣傳及軍工運動之三巨頭，該三主腦人物係孟士衡解京並供述後，由此問治安機關逮捕，並由南京以專機飛滬迎解入京歸案。此外，句日來因此案牽連繼續被逮者頗不乏人，惟關係方面謝絕發表其人數，但表示政府固不願在此時期繼續捕人，而對此項以特務行動企圖顚覆政府者，政府爲自衛計，實無法不採取適切行動。</p>

<p>〔中央社新德里廿七日電〕巴基斯坦明日不擬參加在新德里召開討論緬甸局勢之非正式會議，但擬參加以後之任何正式會商。咸信緬政府最近向英國請求貸款，故必須在英自治領中表明其外交政策。會議之目的有三：一爲計劃恢復緬甸秩序之方法，並支持泰金諾政府；二爲調解紛爭，並禁止供給武裝，或以武力干涉；三爲經濟援助，保衛緬甸食米出口之安全，尼赫魯將代表印度參加會議，錫蘭則由其駐印高級專員代表出席。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿八日電〕澳洲外長伊伐特廿七日夜乘機抵達此問，渠將代表澳洲出席在此聞召開之討論緬甸局勢之英自治領間會議。伊伐特廿八日晨曾與印度總理尼赫　舉行長時會商。</p>

<h3>尼赫魯出席議會　抨擊印共黨叛亂　政府決定採取斷然措置</h3>
<p>〔合衆社新德里廿八日電〕印度總理尼赫魯廿八日吿議會稱：上週杪加爾各答區之刦案，與印度全境之普遍破壞，乃旨在武力推翻政府之共黨行動。尼氏稱，在過去十日內，因「跡近公開叛亂」之暴動，而被捕者已計共黨八七〇人。政府對「謀殺者，縱火者，及破壞者」之斷然措置仍將繼續。渠繼稱：「共黨所採取之熊度，不僅對政府公開敵對，幷係可指爲跡近公開叛亂之態度。下院深悉諸鄰國內之共黨叛亂。印度境內有人圖煽動人民積極叛亂，此點諒卽同一政策之推廣」。渠幷謂，廿六·廿七兩日暴徒在加爾各答之刦案，以及共黨不顧鐵路工人協會不罷工之決議，而仍努力醞釀全國鐵路罷工，實與遠東各地共黨政策有關。在尼氏出席議會時，加爾名答來訊稱，自廿六日與共黨領導之暴徒衝突以來，至少有十八人被害喪生，其中英人三人，印警二人。</p>

<h3>美空軍繼續保持在遠東現有機羣</h3>

<h3>英工黨政綱決定　擴大基本工業國營計劃　共黨攻擊政府依附反蘇聯盟</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿七日電〕今夜據可靠消息：英工黨已決定繼續擴大其基本工業國有計劃，但選舉人有例外。工黨領袖及艾德禮首相等軍要閣員，曾在威特島之山克林秘密會議兩日，煉糖廠及原料國營案，已列入工煎一九五〇年總選舉之暫定政綱，化學工業亦可能加入國營計劃，工黨希望重獲一九五〇年之壓倒勝利。</p>
<p>會議詳情甚少傳出，但聞造船業將不列入國營，大抵因工會反對之故，麵粉廠亦將暫時除外。惟工黨曾審查二三十種工業，以決定何種最適宜於國營，在一九五〇年以前，或有若干出人意外之事。工黨政府迄今已將海外航空公司。英格蘭銀行。海電及無綫電訊·煤礦·鐵路·內河航運·電氣事業等收歸國營，鋼鐵國營案已提交國會。副首相莫理遜及衛生部長倍文領導之內閣左右兩派，在會議中意見並未分裂，與去年提議鋼鐵業國營時不同。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿七日電〕英共黨今日發表宣言，竭力抨繫政府依附北大西洋公約，企岡結合華爾街之富豪·英法荷比之帝國主義·法西斯之西班牙葡萄牙·反動主義之土耳其·保王主義之希臘·成一邪惡之聯盟，以與蘇聯及新民主國·殖民地人民·歐洲之工界作戰。蘇聯向以和平是重，永不作侵略戰爭。文中並要求美軍全數退出英國，史達林杜魯門艾德禮立卽擇地會晤，商討縮軍禁用原子彈。繼乃抨擊馬歇爾計劃，並力促英國速與蘇聯作新貿易談判。末乃宣布共黨擬於下屆普選中提出候選人百名，參加競選。又謂共黨在內國陣綫將主張增高工資·大减利潤·增加富稅，每年建屋四百所。按共黨現在下院六百四十席中僅佔二席。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾獨斷獨行　保守黨桑失民心</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿七日電〕英國一部份保守黨領袖，現正談論解除邱吉爾爲黨綱主要起草者之任務。保守黨上星期在南漢彌史密斯郡下議員補缺選舉中受挫，使該黨受重大打擊，認爲因邱氏競爭演設檢舉政府不當，以致失去民心。該黨國會議員極爲不安，認爲邱吉爾應有一位參謀長，擬訂關於國會及選舉策略。前外長艾登本爲保守黨第二號要人，但消息靈通人士稱，邱翁堅持「唱獨脚戯」。</p>
<h3>艾帥基本職責　美國防部發表佈告</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿八日電〕美國防部長發表佈吿，闡明新任總參謀部主管長官艾森豪威爾元帥之職務。據國防部長稱，艾帥之職務將不牽涉任何「關於對外軍事援助立法案或其他活動之個人職務，使命或責任」。佈吿內特別槪述各種職務如下：</p>

<h3>米高梅加速製片</h3>
<p>「犯罪記」僅需廿八天　范强生終日記誦對白</p>
<p>〔聯合社好萊塢廿七日電〕好萊塢現亦以講求效率爲主。米高梅公司一向拍成電話簿大小之影片，然後剪接，所耗不貲，今已改拍九十頁之緊密影片。其流綫型新片「犯罪記」預定僅需廿八天卽可攝影完畢，時間之短爲該公司歷來任何影片所未有，以致主角范强生加緊工作，終日記誦對白，無暇會客。</p>
<h3>北歐傾向西方聯盟　大西洋公約僅時間問題　蘇聯垂涎挪威原子富藏</h3>
<p>〔聯合社奧斯陸廿七日電〕外交界高級人士今日預料，斯坎的那維亞國家包括傳統的中立國瑞典在內，殆將於今後六個月內參加未來北大西洋公約。挪咸已準備參加，丹麥主要政黨社會民主黨已呼召政府接近西方，以求軍事安全。　瑞典要人亦私下承認瑞典不能長久屬於東西集團間微妙之平衡地位。孤立日益不可能，唯有寄同情於西方。大約瑞典將於今秋以前參加北大西洋聯防。蘇聯倘若對芬蘭採取任何行動，則瑞典之參加或將更爲提早。</p>
<p>〔聯合社奧斯陸廿七日電〕蘇聯希望挪威與西方各國隔離，頗爲熾烈，其中有一秘密原因，卽挪威係一原子國家。在挪威之秘密實騐室中，已有一個儲蓄核子分裂能之原子堆。重水爲原子硏究所必需。在挪威南部荒山中之諾斯克水力廠已有大量生產。鈾鑛亦在挪威中部開採，備有原子擊破器之城市且不祗一處。蘇聯反間諜機關已熟知此事，在莫斯科對挪威政策上現在及未來之影響如何，實爲一大問題。蘇聯對於挪威原子硏究之注意，其表現方式不同，共黨並不諱飾其渴欲獲得此項消息，蘇聯大使阿芬西夫準備歡迎挪威任何科學家之零星報吿，但迄今尙無所獲。就外人所知，挪威科學家並不想玩弄原子彈，其研究集中注意於如何可使原子能供和平用途。卽在此一方面，蘇聯亦有無　之好奇心</p>

<h3>故者南來一學生抵滬談旅途挫折　路經德州不眠不食三日夜</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃在車站邂逅一國立北平大學醫學院六年級學生，渠自稱，係在北平「解放」兩星期後南下，備歷艱隊，昨晚方抵上海。渠因其大部份家屬迄尙留居北平城內，為顧慮彼等之安全，故堅囑記者勿發表其眞實姓名，但渠以肯定而墾切之口吻吿記者，渠此次離平動機，係爲不甘喪失其原有之自由，故不惜以生命作孤注，冒險南下。渠今年暑假卽屆畢業，北平易手前，渠仍在北大附屬第三醫院實習中，渠自言對政治毫無認識，亦不感興趣，故在同學歡騰「解放」聲中，初尙漠不關懷，迨後一連串自然到來之事實，使渠漸感失望，乃萌南下之念。本月十二日深夜，渠於被中共嚴密査禁之短波無綫電中聞得南京廣播，知上海方面有航輪開始北來，渠第一步乃計劃設法先赴秦皇島，因中共對出關或南下規定需請領「路條」遂分往公安局，區署，以探望山東故里父病爲理由，報吿離境路由，行李件數，申請發給。但以取道航程之路由為彼等所疑，故遭延宕推托，奔波數日，竟毫無結果。渠繼又另定計劃，改赴天津設法，但中共對行政上之管制方法並不劃一，抵津後更覺困難重重，不得已終又折返古城。當晚曾對北大某敎授吐露衷曲，並詢渠以老國民黨員之身份，爲何不考慮離平。敎授點然良久，頻稱爲愛護學校勢必留此。</p>
<p>憑路條離北平搭車到達德州</p>
<p>此時渠尙有另一友人亦擬同時與渠作伴南返，乃再度設法張羅「路條」。廿日在公安分局中遇一女性値勤局員，詢明原委後，卽稱：「你是大夫（醫生），曾爲人民服務，可以准許，」但指其友人謂：「你是中央軍校畢業的，暫時還不能離開。」至此渠乃單獨決定持「路條」搭車離平。詎抵德州後，渠發現其友人竟又跟蹤到來，兩人未及細談，卽匆匆交涉「換車」。德州現爲中共兩行政區之轉換站，車站有崗哨綫四重，正因如此，渠等在嚴密檢査後被認爲證件不足，復遭不准登車。渠因南下心切，當夜遂將行李交與其友人，並與之訣別謂：「我決設法混入站內，倘有不測，則君好自爲之。」</p>
<p>站上工人幫助　匿煤車中出境</p>
<p>其時站上有一工人，其家屬曾在平北大第三醫院受診於渠，無意相値後得悉上情，當允代任護送之賣，藉以相報。八時後適有車皮數節自分軌駛出裝煤，此工人卽將渠匿入煤車中，結果終得離境。此後渠沿途設法，數次改道，不眠不貪達三日夜，始於昨抵達上海。據渠談古城近况稱：大學正在醞釀改制，修業年限或將縮短，文法學院將予合併。各學校敎員月薪每人人民券一千五百元，再加發六十斤小米，一袋麵粉，職員每人月薪人民券一千元，外六十斤雜糧，工役每人月薪七五〇元人民券，所得與前相差無幾，且工人地位亦朱如外傳之已見提高。中共頗重視文敎事業，平軍管會下卽設有「文敎組」領導一切文敎活動，古城數次歡迎「解放」之盛會，均係由該組「領導」。北平所有報紙，俱用新華社消息。土地政策，城市工作政策，新民主主義，已成爲改纂學校原有敎程之中心；各大學訓導長，幾盡撤換云。</p>

<h3>你是林彪的部隊嗎？　……局部和平後的北平新見聞……</h3>
<p>— 安德露·洛斯</p>
<p>〔北平訊〕當記者登上了最末了一班飛機到尙木入共產黨之手的北平綫，就逢到一位老朋友對我說：「你可來得正巧，可以著另一部的『震盪世界的十日」了。」按『震盪世界的十日』是一部約翰里德John　Reed描寫在一九一七年十一月時，布爾雪維克握取政權的輝煌巨著。</p>
<p>幾月以來，共產黨在中國節節勝利，是不但可能震盪世界，並且足能改觀世界的天抨，該勵史太林發出和平攻勢，藉以爭得平等的和平。</p>
<p>一直到一月三十一日，共軍才開進北平城，事先並沒有通吿或什麼排塲。</p>
<p>整天行軍</p>
<p>二月三日那天，市內要路上整日行軍，據說是由平津地區開拔到南方戰塲去的。通過北平城的共軍行列中，是有着剛剛掠獲的幾百輛美國卡車，拖着許多日本式大砲和六吋的山砲。自然，紅軍裏也有蘇聯卡車的，但是却並沒有參加這次的行軍行列。</p>
<p>這次行軍中，最令人感動的，並不是在物資方面，而却是人。共軍的衣着，除了戴着皮帽子之外，也是穿着淡黃色的軍裝，和國軍簡直沒有什麼兩樣，並且同樣都是徵來的農民，國軍使你看着是那麼　，但共軍看上去是那麼有勁。這自然是他們平時在「人民解放軍」名義下一種主義訓練的成績。當時有二個學生曾向幾個共軍詢問：「你是林彪的軍隊嗎」？他們回答說：「不，我們是人民的軍隊」。從上述的事件中，我們也可以發現共軍自尊的情形。</p>
<p>自動被動</p>
<p>北平的民衆，有的自動，也有的是被動，都出來歡迎進城的共軍。比較唯一有熱情的，當首推學生的一羣。在街上，常常看到學生打扮着在唱歌，舉行秧歌舞。雖然這種種都是年靑人熱情的表現，但是北平學生運動一向是代表一部民族意識的。在一九一九年和一九二五年的民族主義運動和一九三六年的抗日運動，北平學生運動都有過事實的表現。</p>
<p>其他的北平居民，對行軍後的感應是比較不熱情。北平是中國最有名的文化古城，經過長期苦難的中國人都變得了多疑和好事。他們認爲政府是永久的罪惡，他們對於政府的態度，不在這政府叫什麼名字或有什麼計劃，而是看那個政府能否讓他們活下去。</p>
<p>一位自由主義的外國人回到家裏興奮地對他的廚司說：「共產黨來了」！但是廚司却沉着地回答說：「物價依然是這樣高」。</p>
<p>北平物價是在下跌，這是因爲北平已和內地連貫一氣，水電的供應有了改進，電車也已復駛。八點鐘的戒嚴已經解除。北平的許多人民都已爲共產黨軍隊的示範行動所感動。</p>
<p>接收工作，顯利的進行了，國民黨的華北日報，現在已改出共產黨辦的人民日報了，這報紙是由一位中國著名的報人生編，北平的許多報紙，除了一家之外，都以共產黨新華社的消息代替了以前國民黨的中央社消息。</p>
<p>人才缺乏</p>
<p>一個不易感覺的事實，是缺乏人才（這原是因共產黨的軍事勝利超過政治）。所以他們每接收一個機關，只接管上級的職務，其餘下級人員並沒有變更，比如北平的警察局，除了把六個國民黨官員更調爲共產黨員之外，其他是沒有變化。現在的北平警察局長是譚震將軍，穿着一套棉制服又寬又大，並且把袖子翻捲起來。</p>
<p>「我們對於管理一個城市的經驗很少」這位局長向下屬這樣地報吿說：「我們所知道的只是怎樣去治一個鄕村，我們將向你們學習，但是你們也得向我們學習」，他吿訴警察的第一件事是：窮苦的人民，現在是站起來了。</p>
<p>共產黨，對扶植貧民的工作，似乎很嫻熱，共產黨負到北平後的第一件大事，就是二月七日那天的勞工大會。在大會台上，掛着共黨的旗幟和毛澤東及朱德的肖像。那天從城裏外來的工人有二萬多人，包括們頭溝煤礦的工人代表團。灰色臉孔的勞工榮譽的被擁在台上坐着，演講的人就開始向他們說現在他們有了一個「人民政府」，他們必須勤苦的工作和反對「美國皷吹的和平販子」的攻勢。</p>
<p>印鈔工作</p>
<p>共產煎用種種的方式鼓勵工人尖修鐵路和做其他工作已獲得完全的成功，這原因是它的苦幹和領導樹立了一個好榜樣，並不止是靠宣傳在共軍進入北平的起先幾天，共產黨的幣制主持人曾向從前政府的中央印製廠北平分廠負責人談了二十分鐘的話。這談話的結果，是令這印鈔工廠把貶値很快的金圓劵的印刷工作停止，而改爲印「人民劵」。據說參加道「人民券」印刷工作的共產黨官員曾日夜地工作，在他那寫字台邊的地板上每天只睡覺幾小時呢。</p>
<p>檢討自己</p>
<p>在中國共產煎之內，紀律是很嚴。葉劍英將軍是現在的北平市長，他也只穿着一件沒有勳章的破藍布棉制服，共軍士兵的一切日用品完全由軍方供給，不准自己買什麽東西。有人問共黨的政工人員怎樣去消磨他們晚上的時候，回答却是很嚴厲的幾個字：「檢討自已」。</p>
<p>共產黨員們同有一個安全的警覺，就是除了得軍方允許外，一律禁拍任何照片除了他們公佈的照片之外。別人誰也不容易得到他們的軍隊照像，南京和平代表團經允許而飛到北平來，但是當飛機盤旋在北平上空時，就立卽遭共軍的高射砲轟擊。和平代表團同來的中國新聞記者也被共黨阻止出機塲。</p>
<p>可是過分的守衛嚴格，却幾乎使道城市航空完全和國民黨控制的地區隔離。這是因爲共產黨恐怕飛機成爲軍政方面間諜的工具。同樣的恐怖，是恐怕與天津和其他共產黨軍所佔領地區的無綫電和電報連絡秘密被竊破。在北平，如果有必需的話，尙可以和上海和南京的友人通無綫電話。</p>
<p>現在唯一面對着北平新政府的困難問題是處理外僑和外國關係。北平約有外僑二千人。其中外國使節甚多。因爲北平曾經是中國的首都。</p>
<p>中國共產黨雖然現在已統治一一億老百姓，但是還沒有被任何外國官方承認。所以他們對於外國人的感情是不很好。像在天津，有些外國的使筋包括蘇聯使節在內，想去拜會新任的天津市長，都被拒絕。得到的回答是：「因爲你們不承認我們，所以我們也不能很願意地祇認你們」。這一點，乃是共方缺少外交經騐。因爲在國際法上，外交承認與使節地位是無關的。</p>
<p>共產黨員對於久住內地的外僑也很置疑，因爲他們認爲今日的世界上，反共世界正在積極地反對他們，共產世界只不過是被動地在讚成他們。外僑如果要旅行於北平和其他共區之間，是不受阻擋的，他們可以領得一張路條而旅行。但是在北平，還沒有路條發給過外僑。共區內缺少必需的機械，這是可以想見的事。其缺乏的原因，主要的乃是不願外船開到不津和共區貿易。同樣的情形，外籍新聞記者是很難獲得官方的消息。因爲低級共產黨官員，也都不願意和外籍記者談話。</p>
<p>封閉沒收</p>
<p>在許多外國之中，共產黨最憤恨的是美國，像國家主義者一樣。他們悵美國幫助「反動政統」以干涉中國內政。他們認爲美國是反共的原動力。他們把美國的領事看作在中國版圖內的敵方基員。他們看美籍的記者極可能是間諜。根據報導在瀋陽美國領事館的無綫電台，不但像其他國家的鎭事館無綫電台一樣遭對閉，並且已更進一步地被沒收。</p>
<p>在同時，共產煎員却又感到困難，因爲今後中國如果要很快地現代化起來，唯一的工業物資的源泉却是美國</p>
<p>最近共黨接收天津美國麵粉的事，也是一件新事情。雖然美國經濟援華的原意是加强中國抗共力量，但是表面上却是以食物和醫藥援助中國人民。戰後的美援由國民黨分配的結果，是都裝入了官吏的口袋中。所以美國方面才代以由它自己來分配。這件事，共黨和其他方面認爲是無可抗辯的干涉中國內政。當共黨奪下天津，他們就接收了五千噸的美國麵粉，並且不經美國官方的同意而予以分配。華盛頓對於這事的反應，乃只撤銷在天津和北平的經濟援助機構。</p>
<p>近來反一美帝國主義」的情緒是很激烈，二個美籍記者已被冠以「美帝國主義新聞記者」。曾經有一位中共士兵對美國籍的敎授說：「我們知道美國。那里有一部分人民要想殺我們。有一部人民要想援助我們。但是大部分的美國人却對於中國知道得不多和不加以注意」。最値得注意的，是天津的杜魯門路已經易了名，而羅斯福路却沒有改。</p>

<p>豫鄂前綫「老百姓的軍隊」的統率者：（上）張淦司令官（下）王景宋副司令官（本報特派員房滄浪寄）</p>
<h3>笑面虎懂得人民苦　鼓勵代替鞭策</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員房滄浪</p>
<p>〔本報信陽廿一日快訊〕記者此次決要訪問張淦司令官，王景宋副司令官，霍冠南參謀長。車抵某地，那位五十六歲的張淦將軍，早已竚侯門前，泛起滿臉笑容，展出渾身解數，和我們每一個同業，歡呼，握手，他那出乎至性的光與熱，在八年抗戰及最近三年來，曾經照耀着大別山每一個山峯，照遍了大河以南，蘇皖贛鄂四省邊區一百五十餘縣的每一寸土地，溫暖了千千萬萬軍民們的心，他有光，有熱，有信心，听以他能在這個極險惡的時代，始終站着笑，—活傻一頭「笑彪」。</p>
<p>寒喧旣畢，招待會順着預定的節目，逐幕展開。我們首先靜聽張將軍對於當前局勢的一番意見，他說：「和最好，如果對方不肯拿出誠意商量和，萬一和不成，甚且逐步進逼打過來，那我們就隨時準備接受命令善體民意來應戰」。說到這裏，記者問他：萬一對方現在就打過來，那怎麼辦呢？他頓時仰天一笑，答道：「這時，我們甚表歡迎，稍緩也不妨，因爲對方加上一把勁，我們到時也就加倍充實，加倍健壯了。然而爲了人民的生命財產，還是和平好」！我們從他這番談話中，發現他們的戰鬥意志是出乎理性，他們的戰鬥力量是建築在人民的良知基礎上。豫鄂兩省人民雖衆口同聲，送給張淦兵團一個「老百姓的軍隊」新番號是以鼓勵代替鞭策，而張淦兵團實在是當之無愧。</p>
<p>民樂把龍舞擂起太平鼓</p>
<p>招待會第二個節目是聽情况，看圖表，談到情况，可以報道的，大概已見本報專電，須要補充的，在駐馬店東北兩面，共軍正在拿出吃奶的氣力，對付那在徐蚱被迫投降，監移豫南，迄未繳械的國軍廖于兩師及其他部隊，人數約有三萬，一部已經繳槍離邵，一部正在和共軍討論什麼信用問題，在鐵路西側，舞陽以迄唐河之綫的三萬共軍，正在不斷整補，陸續向襄樊沙宜開拔。共軍欲在沙宜淺水難地帶，以優勢的兵力，火力，控制兩岸，强渡長江，西向以圖入川，東進而窺瀚贛的企圖，雖堪注意，但不須大驚小怪，因爲他們的籌碼還沒充裕，國軍的漁網已經灑向那江之兩岸紅紅的箭頭，待機捕捉。此外，我們從張兵團允許，我們看的一部圖表中，看出他們在佈置情報綱和防諜網方面，已經收到了乙等效果，這是决劵的第一個因素，這與那些爲此而化甲等氣力，只得丁等成效的一較，眞不堪同日而語。</p>
<p>招待會的第三個節目，當然少不了吃喝和娛樂，所幸我們的「派爾」只給霍參謀長的熟情激動，醉倒了一個，但沒有麻煩他們的祖架兵，仍然乘坐汽車，隨着大夥兒回到火車上去睡覺，我在入睡以前，想起在兵團部晚會上，曾經看見他們的官兵和伙夫，像一羣快樂的孩子，擠坐在張將軍後面和兩傍，毫無顧忌的拍手，呌好，哈哈笑，他們眞是一個同甘苦，共患難，快活的大家庭。</p>
<p>第二天，是元省節，又是民樂節，我們這一羣難得下鄕的小「派爾」，在參觀當地民衆代表及武漢報聯會代表向張淦將軍獄上「威震中原」「江漢屛障」兩面錦旗以後，看那由四鄉而來的民衆大舞龍燈，塲上人如潮湧，龍燈五色繽紛，而且多至一百餘條，在　鼓喧天爆竹震耳聲中，這確是難得一見的大塲面，這時那位張淦將軍又搖動他的全身，堆滿一臉笑容，向每一條龍的嘴巴，寒進一條勝利牌的香烟，以酬答龍及舞龍的農民一片盛意，直談龍飛人散，猶覺笑聲在耳。</p>
<p>平安祝雞公長嘯入信陽</p>
<p>橫店採訪工作吿一段落，我們所乘的這一節新聞專車，決定掛在十三日由漢北開的快車後面，直駛信陽，在開車以前我們請軍方將裝置在臥車房間內電話機卸回，向當地各界代表道別後，繼續北進。</p>
<p>列車由橫店北開，經鄂北之孝感，花園，廣水，武勝關，以達豫鄂兩省分界綫之鷄公山，時爲下午四點，鷄公山爲華中唯一避暑勝境，有車站設於山麓，惜因過去十一年來，戰爭不息，山上樹木，已日形减少，房屋亦多破敗，憑窗遙望惟見白雪皚皚，天蒼地茫，令人頓興山河日非之感，在春節前一日，信陽採取緊急疏散措施時，此間居然亦繼確山，潢川，信陽之後，發生一有趣插曲，山上管理局長房向離，曾爲一亦匪亦官之禮山縣鄕長綁去，並繳去步槍卅餘支，風聲傳出，一時鷄公山草本皆兵，其實大隊共軍並未南下，不一日，張兵團北上，混帳鄕長又趁風使舵，將局長及武器，送同原處，旋吿無事，但彼時確山土劣確曾請來冒充劉牌縱隊之土共旋又撤退，信陽的所謂八民治安委員會，在大軍到後，也草草收塲，最苦的是熱心和平的潢川紳士代表，他們被共軍扣留後，到現在遠沒放回，世紀末的狂飚，吹倒了缺乏定力的糊塗虫，這也是時代的悲劇。</p>
<p>車停片刻，蠕蠕而動，下午五時許，抵達信陽，當專車進站時，同行諸靑年「派爾」見別後信陽，確吿無恙，歌呼聲與嘯聲，雜然而起，我們下車與省府羅秘書長，五綏區司令部王鼎九張了且兩處長，張兵團×軍軍部代表一一道謝後，卽整隊乘車入城，因所乘爲軍車，無須呈騐身份證，領竹　等手續，不十分鐘，卽至城內綏區招待所，晚餐後，張軫司令官舉行茶會招待諸記者，卽席報吿豫南軍政情况甚詳。</p>
<p>張翼三好苦李本公奇壯</p>
<p>武漢接壤豫南，諸記者對豫南過去國軍兵力分佈之情况，當面共軍態勢，信陽參會諸元老對於和戰問題之「高見」，以及在這一突出的，有如一根長洋蠟燭形的平漢綫尖端，那由駐馬店以迄信陽之綫，處境的艱苦，均有相當瞭解，所以在茶會席上，對於過去的信陽情况，很少發問，並且對於在春節前，由信陽一跑就跑到黃鶴樓前去的某軍，也沒提及，因爲那個部隊早就應該到後面進補去了，但是，忠厚老實而又拙於外交詞令的張軫將軍，却沒有將那倉皇大疏散的責任，諉諸他人，他祇將從開封撤退以來，所接收的痛苦，悶氣，乃至在和運初期所受的內傷外感，輕輕的說了幾句，最後他以一種近似哀憤的語氣說道：「我們對於「和」，具有百分之百的誠意和信心，想不到幾乎吃了大虧，不能再洩氣了」。</p>
<p>招待會散後，我們一行旋至××軍部訪問張淦兵團第×軍李本一軍長，（綽號么哥）這位將軍，在東南人士記憶中，並不陌生，「八一三」後，蘊草浜一役，他曾經率領着一個團的兵力，重創敵軍，從容掩護了數萬大軍，撤退杭州，由此一戰成名，挽回了「鋼軍」的令譽，奠定了他今日的地位，他今年四十四歲，原籍桂林，在他廿幾年的戎馬生活中，當過大兵，受過高等軍事敎育，走萬重山，打過一百五十多次的硬仗，却從來沒吃過大虧，他的戰鬥精神，在這一個大兵團中，堪稱一塊百鍊鋼，可是他運用在政治意識方面，揮發到社會廣大業衆面前的，他立刻可以化爲繞指柔，使每個接近他的人，很快的能理解到他的機智，靸力，和火一般的熟情，是解決任何困難問題的一個要素。</p>
<p>箭頭所插處隨時可擺隊</p>
<p>這晚地在兩次接見我們的時候，很忠實的報吿了許多情况，他估計在豫南前面的共軍約有七個縱隊，東北兩面，芷在消化，那由徐蚌地區押送過來若干骨與毛，盤旋鐵路西南的共軍在伺機，不管對方的箭頭插向何處，他們的弟兄們，隨時可擺隊相迎，因爲他們旣視保境安民爲天職，堅强的信心是應該有的。</p>
<p>這天午夜，我們探訽駐馬店以北及以東正陽縣攻防戰的情况而後，又傾聽了李軍長所說：李軍北進，經過東雙河各地，因爲士兵寗可在屋簷下淋雨挨凍，不住民房，不擅動民家門外木柴，感動當地居民，紛紛請土兵烤火，吃鹹肉年糕，若干可歌可泣故事，不覺忘倦，軍風紀嚴整，是張兵團成功要素，所以他們走到一地，老百姓的心就定下來，而對方聽到張淦的兵來到，雖沒有像曹操的兵遇張飛卽逃的那樣恐懼，但戒愼格外則由來已久，毋怪外國通訊社，屢次誤傳張淦兵團東調，可見這消息很重要。武漢記者團，在信陽計留二日，除訪問軍政各界，參加省府及綏區之座談會外，並分組深入民間訪問，所集人民大衆之意見，均已提供各方參考改進，對於改善士兵符遇尤表關切，諸事就遂，我們一行乃於十五日晨八時半，乘平漢特備之輕便飛快車，前往駐馬店，訪問前綫軍民。</p>

<p>樹大橋鍋料延誤，截至目前僅運到橋分之便橋設計，僅合於三月份以前低水位時應用，高水位漲起以前，亟需鋼樑，俾便完成（本報者藻寄</p>
<h3>樟樹大橋工程　鋼樑尙待解決</h3>
<p>— 本報記者劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌廿一一日航訊〕浙贛鐵路樟樹大橋曁贛江支流大橋重建工程，去冬因加拿大鋼樑未能如期運到，僅於卅七年九月完成二橋混凝土墩座工程及河底打撈工程百分之五十，自該路南昌株州段通車後，運輸繁忙，乃於去年十二月一日完成一座工程相當艱巨之便橋，藉以貫通該路一千三百餘公里之直達通車，惟該項便橋於架設之初，因木料缺乏，江面過寬，以及其他方面困難，僅預計達到今年春汛以前低水位時之懸用，頃據橋工處處長黃壽益曁南春段工程處長鄒岳生近由樟樹來省談：贛江水位漸已上漲，今年最高水位，已達五十五公尺七，距橋面之高水位標準五十八公尺，僅差二公尺二，路局雖一度計劃加高橋面，但以材料及橋高後之行車安全問題，未做決定，今後贛江水位，如再增漲，則西段行車，到達樟樹站時，可能恢復用擺渡及東西兩岸接運辦法，以資維持。至大橋鋼樑，聞已有六孔運抵上海，另有三孔，由外輪運至台北時於本月十日船上失火，須轉運九龍起卸。現有鋼樑，僅及橋址所需材料之百分之十，故此次　援調査團到達樟樹時，對人橋工程給予了特殊的注意，一致同意應急急設法，以便達成浙贛路今後所負之重大使命。</p>

<h3>中央銀行通函取取消限制　外匯證可自由買賣　新方案實施細則將陸續公布</h3>
<p>中央銀行前爲防止投機，曾發出一七〇號通函，對外匯證之買賣，加以限制，卽非進出口商，不能買賣。此次財金方案公布後，此項通函自應取銷，該行已於廿八日發出通函，通知各指定銀行知照，今後外匯證可自由買賣。</p>
<p>外匯移轉證書昨（廿八日）市先挺後軟，晨開二七五〇元，市氣頗旺，升爲二八〇〇元。斯時中央銀行逢高吐售，終被壓退，午收爲二六六〇元，但較上週末略起十元。</p>
<p>中央銀行劉總裁，業於廿七日由港返滬，當分別激集金融界領袖交換財金改革方案實施意見，並召集國行各部負責人會商有關實施問題，據國行發言人吿記者稱：</p>
<p>（一）財金改革方案實施細則，卽將陸續公布，與中央銀行有關者，已着手辦理。</p>
<p>（二）金圓劵仍繼續發行，但盡量緊縮，蓋就整個財金方案之立法精神言，緊縮金圓劵之發行，則爲該方案電要之一環。</p>

<h3>折讓貨價及支付佣金央行准從寬核結外匯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會息：出口廠商貨品輸出後，往柱因不可抗力而使其質量降低，致國外買主於收到貨物後，發生請求折讓貨價之情事。此種折讓貨價，在有信譽之出口商行，往往可達年出口之千分之五。此外出口商品往往因其種類瑣屑處理煩難，或行銷地域僻鄙，其國外代理人遂藉以索取較高成數之佣金。此兩項外匯之支給，在目前結匯情形下，原均在出口商所結售與央行之出口外匯內扣償。惟央行爲防止外匯資金之浪費，過去對於該兩項外匯之撥付，其審核標凖頗爲嚴格。出口商行，常因此陷於困難。輸管會爲體恤商艱，曾就此項問題，數度與中央銀行洽商請求放寬辦理。茲已獲得該行同意，凡我國出口商營運貨品，出口後發生上項買主請求折讓貨價時，如能提出確切合理證件，如公證行公量單，及化驗單等，央行當可斟酌實際情形，量予核辦，至於國外代理人佣金之申請，如其出口貨品之佣金率，在央行所訂出口貨佣金率範圍以內者，當按規定辦理。如該項出口貨佣金率，尙未釐訂者，得參照出口商提供之確切證明文件核辦，惟其金額最高不得超過該批出口貨F·O·B·總値之百分之五云。</p>
<h3>國家行局差進銀根午後轉緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市銀根先鬆，上午日拆爲每千元三五元至四十元，午後因銀根抽緊，升至五十元以上，最高見六十元。昨日國行因軍政費用支出浩繁，有大量頭寸流出，但因交通銀行大拋結匯證，差進頭寸達八億以上，銀根因之抽緊。計昨日國家行局差進五億四千八百九十二萬，洋商銀行差進八億三千三百八十萬，大交換差進六億五千三百九十萬，小交換差出十二億八千六百二十億。</p>
<h3>銀錢業存欠息今起分別提高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀錢業存欠息今日起提高，存息由日拆每千元七元五角調整至每千元十元折合月息九角；放息由日拆每千元三十元調整至每千元四十元，折合月息一元二角。同業日拆亦由每千元二十四元提高至三十二元，折合月息九角六分。又銀錢業本月份存欠息，存息每千元二百二十五元，折合月息二角五分半，欠息每千元一千八百元，折合月息一元八角。</p>
<h3>華股開場鋒俏臨收均見疲滯</h3>
<p>股票市塲昨以初開環境有利，業內外人心一致發揚，奮力進取，强度盤。中程在十時半許，各股又多登限。同業逢高有售，新買相持觀望，銳氣乃洩，迨生活指數發表，又見增高，浮多獲利思遷，永紗先霸滯態，他股隨同徐軟。近收均以當程低價收市，結果均比上週六日續升一分至十元〇三角。台糖升一九五〇元，仍在漲限收市。振漆永業在漲限叫買。他股曾登漲限者，計有華豐·新亞·上泥·榮豐·勤興·美亞·商務·火柴·計八種。永紗高價爲三元四角一分，低價爲三元一角八分，計有二角三分上落，終升一角二分。各股成交頗盛，半日共做四八億二千四百四十萬股，內永紗一僅六千二百七十萬股，景福二七億七千七百萬股。</p>
<h3>外股榮辱互見</h3>
<p>外股市勢，榮辱互見。怡紗做六千三百元，六千五百元，較上日軋升三百元。英聯平平，與上週六收盤同。會德豐因圈外金融性物價報　，故亦見高升，做一萬七千元，較上日升起一千元，其他各股皆平平。</p>
<h3>本市一百五十餘家銀樓　今日正式復業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀樓業公會所屬會員一百五十餘家，於昨日上午十時起，業已開始非正式營業。惟以屬試做性質，故彼此開出飾金行市，頗有參差，大致高至每兩十六萬元，低至十五萬六千元。該項價格，業已包括百分之十之合法利潤及營業費用在內，至手工費則論件計算。收入則照售價抑低一成之譜。自今日起，該業已決定正式營業，每日營業時間，自上午十時起，至下午四時止，凡屬本市銀樓業公會之會員，其價格均劃一掛牌，隨時隨市機動上落。報價辦法，共分三組。第一組會員十七家，由小東門寳成銀樓吳彭年負責，第二組會員亦十七家，由金陵路物華銀樓陳德璋負責。第三組會員一百二十餘家，由福煦路老天寳裘雲長負責。各會員將隨時與三組負責人聯繫，俾取得協調而凖確之行市。又該業議定，今日以黃金條塊托鑄飾金者，每兩須貼補蝕耗五千元。</p>
<h3>產價報升人心昂俏食米走勢堅定　粉糧食油一致猛烈上升</h3>
<p>食米昨挺升成餘，初市以產地價格堅昻，業外各物激漲，人心殊堅，各貨普升三千元。後市以金價報跌，人心轉疲，加以米店納胃已滿，實銷轉呆，回挫四五百元不等。計薄稻萬五千五百元，白粳萬五千三百元，早稻羊秈均爲萬五千元，碾秈萬四千八百元。昨日市塲登記到貨，共二千六百三十七石。</p>
<p>麵粉　猛烈上升，開市後以業外各物激升，老車開盤急叩七千關，中途聞米價下跌，曾一度回小，惟以銀根頗鬆，本街添補甚多，北帮亦多納進，臨收重吿回揚，以七千三百五十元成交。兵船初開六千五百元，後市在實銷暢盛下，收盤高達六千八百五十元，收市後散戶力吸，最後升達七千元。麩皮客帮猛吸，亦挺二成以上，大包阜鹽做五千五百六十元。</p>
<p>雜糧　瘋狂上漲，黃豆油廠力吸，乍豆車豆普挺三成，生仁芝蔴本街及油廠胃口均濃，各挺二成至四成。苞米靑帮納進甚力，激升三成以上。紅糧酒廠納胃頗濃，猛晋四成，姜　明光均叩七千關。</p>
<p>油市　突飛猛晋，因銀根頗鬆，金鈔價格報漲，人心堅　，豆油開市挺升六千元，中途散戶活躍，市勢最為一度高做六萬七千元，收市貨主乘高脫售頗多，且圈外報小，略見回挫，以六萬五千元成交。生汕供應較稀，激漲八千元，靑島吉桶破七關。生菜油蔴油一律挺秀，豆餅客帮搜購，漲勢最猛，長字餅一度急叩八千關。</p>
<h3>絲綢激烈上揚</h3>
<p>生絲優級另担，昨晨開爲八二萬元，旋以中蠶公司賣出D級獅虎牌二十担，爲本市綢廠帮買進，價以每磅美元二元四角五分，按二六〇〇元外匯證結算，合金圓每担爲八五萬元。俄而各市塲轉　，優級另担，升九三萬元收市，較上週六升達十萬元左右，餘乏人問津。</p>
<p>人絲天橋初開爲七二五〇〇〇元，一度低至七〇萬五千元，斯尼亞西石，低爲七〇萬元，午收又轉俏，以七八元收市，亦較上週六升十萬元左右，套利仍爲四角</p>

<h3>市場散步</h3>
<p>— 看台客</p>
<p>股市轉風今宵在</p>
<p>昨天一般市面，都是先漲後跌。週末傳說的抽緊銀根，報上　漫的和平空氣：一併反映到昨天市塲上，</p>
<p>然而，央行當局否認有結束金圓劵發行的公開聲明，市塲中又盛傳發行五百元大票的謠言；反刺激不起什麼反應。</p>
<p>週末的傳說，昨天收效，昨天發生的新事件，反不見效。可見昨天的塲子，週末已經紮緊。非有大戶背景，何能有此力貴？</p>
<p>此時此地，看了金圓券的面子，做幾把空頭帮帮忙。危險賽過刀口上舐血，事實也非大脚撐不可。</p>
<p>得留心，大脚掙縱使帮忙有意，也懂得逆水行舟只能適可而止。因而，今天就得提防着：時當月初，還加央行當局昨天公開否認結束發行一事，也許已經棋先一着了。股市中人，更須當心。</p>
<p>昨天紗布暴跳，驚人演出，走勢獨與金銀證劵等背馳，四十二支　鳳到一百萬，那能不叫人心驚魄動。</p>
<p>然而，這以過去市價作想，確有可以認爲漲得猛烈之理。假使提到此間現正恢復</p>
<p>紗布南運，而香港方面，昨又止跌回漲，那就不能以「今之視昔」了。</p>
<p>一個重要的新事件，就是港粵帮大量收購，原因港地紗布疋市面，前因此間恢復南運，一度回小，沉寂將達三週之多，上週末突因南非在港大量訂貨，市勢重振。於是反映到昨天的本地市塲上來了。　和平空氣輯濃聲中，商理糧食市塲，應該首當其衝，領導下落的。想不到事適其反，昨天米粉一律暴漲，食油也跟漲頗烈。</p>
<p>借問何故？道理又極簡單，因爲本期戶口米配售價，可能宿疾復發，不觀夫配證消息杳然，就是皮裏春秋也。　但是有二件事，不能不提，昨天無錫白粳，一口氣跌去五百多，麵粉小麥也跌去不少。</p>
<p>還有一件事，聯合國撤銷食汕世界配給制度後，各國油價都大跌，像香港在上過內，菜汕茶油一律跌掉一二成。</p>
<p>然而，近年本地風光，市塲早變球塲，塲地有變，實銷自可不問。</p>
<h3>橡膠品配貨多</h3>
<p>廠盤傳將增加二成</p>
<p>橡膠製品聞廠盤又將調整，再加二成，各車胎商及膠鞋商紛將售價標高，以免遭受售出後不易補入之損失。惟近日廠方有大量配貨出籠，致市貨充斥。市塲內喊價，未見過份激昻，雙錢男套鞋每打做一萬二千九百元，大平靴一萬六千八百元，長統靴五萬九千元，較上週末喊高甚微。生橡膠成交殊稀，昨晨每磅喊五百元。</p>
<h3>棉紗堅檔挺進布市人心振奮</h3>
<p>棉紗趨勢健旺，在銀根鬆濫之下，人心續見振奮，市價再向堅檔邁進，昨日塲內買進空氣仍甚濃郁，執戶咸雖有不捨之勢，結果細紗漲勢較爲猛烈，粗紗則徽露秀色。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳初以八十七萬元之低檔開出，中途竟哄抬至一百萬元光景，最後回落至九十萬元站住，軋升十萬元。</p>
<p>四〇支藍鳳亦晋十萬元，三二支銀月由七十七萬元喊低至七十萬元結局，激挺十一萬元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨自五十八萬元開出，旋萬至六十一萬五千元後，卽回至五十六萬元收市，校週六升三萬元。廠單現出五十三萬元，隔天出五十四萬八千元。</p>
<p>二〇支雙馬昻六萬元，以五十三萬五千元結束，其他如一六支粗紗等，亦見秀挺。　布市以利買消息盛傳於市，人心激昻，兼之銀根仍鬆，圈外物價亦受波動，同業又思進取，粵帮相繼搜補，執戶堅特不放，買氣復吿汹湧，各布猛烈騰升。</p>
<p>龍頭細布初以二萬一千七百元開出後，卽高見二萬三千二百萬元，終爲二萬三千元，較週末暴漲四千九百元，喇叭童細布激挺三千七百元，以二萬〇六百元收市。B龍頭細布亦升三千五百元</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰自二萬〇四百元做小至二萬〇一百元，收市復昻至二萬一千元，終跳四千元。金運妙舞元嗶嘰晨開一萬九千七百元，午刻破二萬元大關，至二萬〇三百元結局，較前高三千六百元。二九〇高檔士林，廠盤提高至四萬五千五百元，其他各布無不出現新高價。</p>
<h3>中紡循例售紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售紗，仍採報價核售制，共開七種，計售二二一件，准購九一戶，價値一六三〇四萬元。　各支紗售價，（單位千元）八支日光二八五元，十六支經月四五五元，廿支雙股藍鳳五三〇元，廿一支仙桃二等五一〇元，三十二支日光六三〇元，四〇支紅寳光八一〇元，四二支　股龍門八三〇元。</p>
<h3>呢羢銷路日狹</h3>
<p>毛織品呢羢銷路，邇來日趨狹隘，除台灣帮略有裝辦外，完全祗靠本街一隅，各貨銷路，有與日俱减模樣。蓋東北華北廣大市塲消失，西南各省因交通阻滯，絕少來滬採辦，兩廣兩湖及浙贛等地，所有呢羢銷路，大半均被港埠走私貨所奪去，此均係事實之證明。同時上海一埠生意，復因時局動盪不安，物價高漲，中西衣着實銷亦漸轉削减。</p>
<h3>食糖一致高翔</h3>
<p>昨糖市走勢，由於漢口帮實銷有動，津帮亦有動辦，（北路交通雖滯，客帮猶待海運開放時啓運），况暗息未見緊　，大致三〇至三五元，交易因而大暢，行盤一致翱翔。四半晨開二七八〇〇元，後在二七〇〇〇元邊緣　　，終以二七二〇〇元午收，較上週六軋升二千餘元。三半止於二四五〇〇元，升一五〇〇元。粗砂二六〇〇元，俏二三〇〇元</p>
<p>靑糖提靑，先見一四五〇〇元，中途仍升至一五〇〇〇元，午收則爲一五五〇〇〇元，挺起二五〇〇元。其他各檔，做價均見上升一成光景。</p>
<p>台糧公司核配粗砂</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕台糖公司昨核配第五十二期粗砂一種（二百斤裝），價每担二萬三千五百元，結果共配出一萬餘包。</p>
<h3>金價午後微疲</h3>
<p>最高曾至十六萬一</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日金市趨勢先盛後衰。晨起於開盤前，人心承上週末之堅勢，又傳大鈔發行在卽，行市遂一致哄高，已見十五萬六至十五萬九之行市。九時半卽以十五萬八至十六萬一之高盤開出。而上午頭寸奇鬆，三角半供應不絕，故行市始終起伏於十五萬二至十五萬八之間，迨十一時許，以交行不絕有外匯移轉證拋出，銀根漸露緊勢，行市漸疲。終以十四萬八至十五萬收盤。下午開盤時銀根緊勢未弛，二時尤見奇緊，曾見十四萬七至十四萬九低盤，一度曾回高至十五萬二至十五萬四，終仍以十四萬七至十四萬九之最低盤收盤。</p>
<h3>黃金公債　昨起暫停發售</h3>
<p>定明日抽籤還本</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕黃金短期公債第一期債票，定明日抽籤還本，昨日起暫停發售。國行掛牌仍爲每兩十一萬四千五百元，與上週牌價相同。黃金債劵自二月十一日開始發售以來，至月底爲止，共售出公債票面四千零九十兩。</p>
<h3>基金會今日成立</h3>
<p>三十八年黃金短期公債基金保管委負會委員，各關係機關團體，前已推定代表，幷經財政部分別聘派。嗣因徐部長在粵未及成立，刻以第一次抽籤還本，定於三月二日舉行，聞該會業訂於三月一日下午四時，假太市中央銀行三樓會議室，召開成立會。又訊該會委員兼政府代表傅汝霖，劉攻芸，陳炳章，全國商會聯合會代表朱惠淸，全國銀行商業同業公會代表徐國懋，全國錢商業同業公會代表關能創，工業協會代表莊智煥等云</p>
<h3>錢兌莊準備復業</h3>
<p>財政部公佈金銀准許自由賣買後，本市錢兌莊又凖備復業。現江西路四川路一帶錢兌莊正在大興土木，裝修門面。據該榮業中人稱，錢兌莊前率令解散，茲因政府開放金銀賣買，該業同人特聯名呈請主管機關准予復業，一俟批准，卽可正式復業。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>木材行市，賡續邁進，市塲竟少開出，塲外喊三百四，三百五，最高到三百七。三夾板亦抵一千二，一千五。杉木續跳，價做一百元，市勢依然看好。</p>
<p>靑磚高廿萬關，小瓦亦抵十萬，機瓦爲一百四十元，美貨牛毛毡跟升至一萬二千元，松香柏油亦　，開一百五十元。</p>
<p>陽衣開價一度高至一萬後，以移轉證突吿回低，部份臘家，在三千二三百元時未會推出，受虧甚大，交易亦因此頓吿萎　。但鹽貨收價因肉價高漲，反見扳高，每副由二百八十元升達三百元。</p>
<p>本市與平津間，交通梗斷，匯兌停頓爲時已久。茲經採悉：本市上海信託公司，無客戶不斷請求，已恢復承辦平津匯兌，藉利家用　萎，開始以來，託匯衆多。</p>
<p>藥材市况，老揀香四千元，軋漲四百元，　黃四萬元。較上週軋漲四千元，未有多大成交，僅零星而已。羚羊角市價益趨疲軟，白朮下降二百元，餘貨仍站原價。</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽第二循環開始　仁餘再戰麥令　今晚五時半起在市體育館</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽第一循環，除尙有三塲改期比賽外，業已順利結東。第二循環定於今晚開始，主力戰爲仁餘戰美軍麥令斯。賽前有甲二維賽兩塲，五時半起，在市體育館角逐，門劵照舊，秩序列下：</p>
<p>回力——華南（甲二B）五時州分　狄憲章　吳效堤</p>
<p>暴風雨——西靑藍（甲二A）六時卅分　王基恩　吳詩鑑</p>
<p>仁餘——麥令斯（甲一組）七時卅分　陳寶琳　陳頌良</p>
<p>仁餘最近朝氣蓬勃，頗受球迷一擁戴，尤以數日前擊敗滬警一役，相當精彩。陣容除吳新運，沈鵬舉，姚文彝，孫國政，徐仲已，王槐庭外，近又得蔡金典助陣，益見人材濟濟。第一循環，首逢麥令斯，仁餘以五十七比三十七大勝。美軍球隊，每愈打愈精，一俟塲地熟悉，便令人括目相看，於是第二次友誼比賽中，麥令三軍用命，以一分擊敗仁餘，卅七比卅六，報復前仇。今晚三次重逢，麥令斯雖五戰五北，然最近數仗，成績奇佳，仁餘今晚並不能毫無戒備，屆時舊敵當前，定將有一塲精彩表演。</p>
<p>第一塲甲二B組回力B對華南首先交兵，回力B麾下有白葆康，王士德，尙崇嶽，鮑友管，四騎士首仗輕取無名，充分顯示其雄偉實力，惟孟憲成足傷恐不克出塲，華南亦有黃天烈，何涵夫，劉福强，李賢政輩，知名之士，陣容未見軟弱，但上週福强誤卯，竟敗於無名，由此推論，今日難逃劫數也。</p>
<p>第二塲甲二A組暴風雨戰西青藍，暴風雨乃南洋模範學子所組成，得美籍指導熊史丹雷，悉心薰陶，球藝楚楚可觀，西靑藍較爲平庸，必難得逞。</p>
<p>今晚六隊名單</p>
<p>（回力）白葆康，王士德，尙祟嶺，尙崇嶽，鮑友管，孟憲成，姚立羣，郭耀嵩，盧鼎厚。　（華南）何涵夫，黃天烈，鄧國璋，李賢政，劉福强，高家　，張岱松，鄧嵩嶼。</p>
<p>（暴風雨）沈士華，沈士淸，傅國柱，翁默淵，局克竣，蔣彥振，葉松喬，周登和，陸振東，李應亨。</p>

<h3>香港銀牌足球賽　南華南獲得決賽權　賴馮景祥頭上一頂　比賽緊張激烈　深扣球迷心弦</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕香港足球現正進入白熱化階段，「特別銀牌」這個重要節目亦已到了決賽週，向稱華南霸主的南華南仍然不辱使命，在上週末（廿六日）淘汰了聖約瑟，獲得決賽權。</p>
<p>這塲比賽給香港人士一個極深刻的印象，緊張刺激，好像看了一部美國開打的西部武俠片。結果南華南以僅有的一球獲得勝利，而且還是靠頭頂成功的。</p>
<p>雖則南華南因人脚不齊，再加以黎「佛爺」是帶傷勉强上塲，故而演不出應有的水凖，但因聖約瑟實力加强，因一漲一縮的關繫，便打得落花流水，竟形成了一塲難得而見到的緊張賽事。戰後約瑟中人，雖仍有慨嘆輸得不値的，但也有以爲敗是事前已自知之事，到頭來只輸一球，却自引以爲榮，還有某人，竟用玩笑的口吻，請記者大書昨日之事，是「百年內的足球惡戰」，但我也曾開頑笑地說，「不大書兩方俱走樣，已賞臉萬分了，若言實際，還說不上是本年最好的一塲」</p>
<p>樹陵賣力威風八面</p>
<p>有人因見張樹陵賽得頭頭是道，有時竟至盤球遠出助攻，便以爲是全塲最好的一個，但我却並不作如是想，因爲賽得好時，還要考究一下他担任看管的是誰人，如果這次是西維亞始終當右翼，樹陵還有同樣八面威風的演出，便應大讚而特讚，可是在大部份時期，他只是在抵禦傷了足的馬奇士，便不能作此批評了，雖然他的特別賣力，也得讃詡，我要特別讚的還是聖約瑟的施利華，如果不是他有超水凖的演出，則南南勝來，當可較易。還有一個要讚的是田協波，以他的短小身材，落在猛虎羣裏，也居然宜輔宜翼，雖然終因朱永强越位不算數，實際上他還曾射入過一球，這人如果能多在南南隊晨演出，前途會未可限量。，開賽時雙方列陣如下：</p>
<p>南華南</p>
<p>余耀德</p>
<p>張樹陵</p>
<p>侯榕生</p>
<p>張金海</p>
<p>謝錦洪</p>
<p>劉松生</p>
<p>謝錦河</p>
<p>黎兆榮</p>
<p>朱永強</p>
<p>田協波</p>
<p>馮景祥</p>
<p>聖約瑟</p>
<p>施利華</p>
<p>許竟成</p>
<p>高山龍</p>
<p>山度士</p>
<p>李安納</p>
<p>文第士</p>
<p>帕利拉</p>
<p>甘美士</p>
<p>羅差</p>
<p>馬奇士</p>
<p>西維亞</p>
<p>過程緊張扣人心弦</p>
<p>在初開賽時，聖約瑟一鼓作氣，打來頗有瞄頭，南南雖兩次攻入，也不久便被擊退，五分鐘時，著名「大舖　」的判松生，忽在廿五碼外發重砲，可惜去勢略高，只彈中門楣，不得其門而入，可是去勢急勁，彈得龍門架亦搖了幾搖，算守門員是天仙，也無法擋救的。球反彈後，「生牯」又再獲得，重施故技，再行遠封，這回却射得過高，凌空落野。直賽九分鐘，聖約瑟才有西維亞得機吊門，却被靚德妙手拒退，此後便見南南聲勢洶洶。十分鐘時，朱永强自廿碼之遙力射，被施利華接獲，隨後有田協波吊門，永强乘機衝進，欲施頭頂，却又被施利華勇往抵住，十五分鐘時，南南曾逢一險，那時是羅差近門得球，可喜他的控制脚法未到家，欲射時却有膝蓋觸球，錯過了似可必勝機會。</p>
<p>自此以後，差不多是球兒多在南南控制下，廿二分鐘時，在馮景祥妙足傳中時，但見其餘四鋒，一窠蜂湧入，黎兆榮迎來球，一按一撥，短小精悍的田協波已接應盤球掩進射入，在他自己，是完全未陷於任何犯規舉動的，可惜同時有朱永强在正中越位，於是田氏雖射得淸脆玲瓏，可是仍不能作算，眞是太可惜的一回事。</p>
<p>在此一事的不久以後，田協波又曾妙足射中一記，球是欲自楣底入網，可奈施利華身手不凡，居然能及時一跳，將球推出，此後南南曾利用三角短傳攻門甚急，却仍被約瑟中人力守得免。約三十分鐘時，馬奇士足部微跛，改當右翼，由西維亞入充右輔，這時馮二叔常有美妙的傳中，無奈其他諸鋒，多未能利用此種機會，一次黎兆榮曾突迎着二叔的妙球，凌空便射，却又被施利華因取位得當，接個滿懷，雖被來球撞得朝天跌倒門限外，却仍能牢牢將球抱穩，翻身救脫。一次錦河也曾凌空射中，一次永强射中，都一一被施利華沒收，上半時賽成個零比零局面。</p>
<p>南南門前遭遇大險</p>
<p>下半時南南有馮景祥與田協波易位，田的翼鋒技能也相當可以，七分鐘，朱永强射中被接，九分鐘，田協波傳中，永强近門用頭斜頂，似必得利，因爲那時施利華被引傾右，球兒剛向左方空檔竄入，不道聖隊運氣好，在施利華翻身樸球時，竟被他的手指觸着來球，彈斜出界，南南只獲得角球，終無濟於事。又一次田馮互傳並進，在傳中時，有永强竄入一頭近門擁去，無奈撞個空，又失良機。如是者賽足多時，南南大約佔了八成攻勢，所差却是無法把球兒打進網窩，一時急得華人觀衆替南南打氣。至廿五分鐘時，南南曾有一險，那時是西維亞自三十碼左右突施冷箭，球自門左來，余耀德雖剛能及時推去，仍負角球，小吿以爲機會難逢，竟遠主踢角球，不道究失練習，竟一脚將球踢到網後去，只惹得觀衆的大笑揶揄。卅二分鐘時，南南又逢大險，那時有帕利拉盤球切入，那時雖已有侯子追纏，錦洪包抄，小帕仍自奮勇前進，靚德見球兒向門滾，便跑出欲拾，只因前面有自家人，不禁略慢，不道一慢被帕利拉竄入奪球反傳，時有羅差迎上，認空門便撥，球目楣底墮入，爲勢萬險，尙幸靚得機譽，一知有失，便急退後，竟能在球到時人也回到門下，凌空躍起一推，竟將正墮向門際之球推過網頂，雖多負一次角球，却救了彌天禍事。</p>
<p>二叔可人頭上見功</p>
<p>大難不死，必有後福，話眞不錯，在南南逃過大險方三分鐘，謝錦河忽然得機認門斜射，刁鑽的馮景祥眼見有機可乘，已同時隨入，那時施利華本已取定位置，準備接錦河射來之球，那知球未到手，已被二叔躍高一搖頭，額際雖僅輕輕擦着，球已改道入網，於是在如雷歡聲中，南南已打開紀錄。</p>
<p>約瑟一負此球，知大勢已去，便下破釜沉舟之志，由小吿出當中鋒，羅差退作右衛，可是小吿不復如前活潑，終無報復之方，直至九十分鐘賽完，仍是交白卷，於是南南以一對零得決賽權。</p>

        <h1>1949.03.01</h1>
<h3>The Capital City Filled with an Atmosphere of Unity; Peace Talk Contents Under Discussion; Sun Ke Arrives in Nanjing, Zhang Qun and Cheng Qian About to Come East</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The important consultation that Acting President Li invited central and local officials to Nanjing to hold has, in fact, largely begun. After the Shanghai Peace Delegation arrived in Nanjing from Peiping on the 27th and President Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Guangzhou on the 28th, this consultation became more concrete. Once Zhang Qun and Cheng Qian arrive and participate in the talks, a conclusion can be reached. People close to Acting President Li strongly denied the convening of a conference on the 28th, but did not deny that consultations were underway. It is said that this is Acting President Li inviting leaders from various regions to Nanjing to talk after taking office and touring the south, and there is no formal meeting. Furthermore, the content of the discussions is very broad. The important meetings at the Acting President's official residence reported in the newspapers in recent days did not occur. If there were any, they were only occasional gatherings of important officials for talks. According to sources, there are currently two main problems for the government: (1) How to enhance internal unity to ensure consistency of opinions and concentration of power; and (2) How to start negotiations with the Chinese Communists to achieve the goal of comprehensive peace. Regarding the former, Acting President Li's previous southern tour yielded significant gains. This gathering of important officials in Nanjing to exchange views can further lead to a consistent position. Internal unity within the government is also of great importance for peace talks. Chinese Communist broadcasts have repeatedly mentioned differences of opinion within the government, and on the 27th, there was a broadcast of the so-called "struggle between Li Zongren and Sun Ke for leadership of the Kuomintang," which has now been disproven. Regarding the latter, Shao Lizi's participation in the Shanghai Peace Delegation's trip to Peiping in a private capacity has greatly benefited the government's decision-making. With formal negotiations about to begin, the government seems to need to be fully prepared. In fact, these consultations have already begun. Acting President Li has twice invited President of the Control Yuan Yu Youren to long talks in recent days, first consulting this veteran of the party and the country on major policy decisions. President of the Legislative Yuan Tong Guanxian and Vice President of the Executive Yuan Wu Tiecheng have also paid several visits to discuss matters. After the Shanghai Peace Delegation returned to Nanjing on the 27th, Acting President Li had three separate talks with Shao Lizi by the evening of the 28th. After the banquet on the evening of the 28th, Acting President Li kept He Yingqin and Bai Chongxi to talk until late at night. Acting President Li discussed Shao's report on the Chinese Communists' capabilities and Mao Zedong's strengths in detail with He and Bai. After Sun Ke arrived in Nanjing on the 28th, he went to Acting President Li's official residence at 5 p.m. to pay a visit. Zhang Zhizhong was also present, and the long conversation lasted until 7 p.m. It is expected that after Zhang Qun and Cheng Qian arrive in Nanjing, these consultations will be accelerated, with the hope of reaching a concrete conclusion within two or three days. After Shao Lizi returns from Peiping, how the government will promote the formal start of peace talks will also be finalized during these consultations.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Well-informed sources have rumored that when the Peace Delegation returned to Nanjing, it did bring back several preconditions put forward by the Chinese Communists. It is said that among them are demands using Hankou and Xi'an as leverage, namely, that Hankou and Xi'an must first be "liberated" by the Chinese Communists. Observers believe that if this is the case, it would be too harsh on Acting President Li's sincerity, because Central China's military affairs are a key area where Li and Bai Chongxi can personally command, and it would not be easy to give up lightly.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 28th] The weather was bad on the 28th, and Zhang Qun changed his flight to Nanjing to another day.</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 28th] Cheng Qian originally planned to take Zhang Qun's special "Ziqiang" plane from Chongqing via Changsha to Nanjing on the 28th. However, on the evening of the 27th, a military aircraft made a forced landing at Changbu Jieshan Airport in Changsha due to insufficient fuel, and the runway was damaged. It was temporarily impossible to land, so he was unable to travel with Zhang. Cheng plans to go to Hengyang to fly to Nanjing instead.</p>
<h3>Internal Decisions on Candidates for Peace Talks on Both Sides; The Government Has Learned of the Chinese Communist Representative List, but Does Not Want to Reveal It Before Publication</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] With the prospect of peace talks beginning, the general public is paying close attention. Of particular importance is the selection of representatives for both sides to conduct the negotiations. The Chinese Communist side has already determined its candidates, and government officials have also learned of their list, but are unwilling to reveal it before the Chinese Communists officially announce it. As for whether the government's representatives will still be the previously announced Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, and Zhong Tianxin, the authorities are also considering it. Qualified sources have revealed that there may be slight changes in this selection, and the number of people is likely to increase slightly.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The four members of the Peace Delegation, Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Shao Lizi, continued to receive a warm welcome from all sides in Nanjing on the 28th. The Capital Hotel of the China Travel Service, where the Peace Delegation is staying, was filled with visitors in the morning and afternoon on the 28th, expressing their condolences for the hard work of the four elder statesmen of peace. In the morning, Ju Zheng, Bai Chongxi, Huang Shaohong, Gan Jiaxin, Huang Yuren, and others visited one after another. At noon, Zhang Zhizhong went to visit and talk for nearly an hour. In the afternoon, Vice President of the Executive Yuan Wu Tiecheng, Huang Bodu, and more than ten members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan also visited. At noon, the delegation attended a banquet hosted by the Presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, Tong Guanxian and Yu Youren. In the evening, they attended a joint banquet hosted by the President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng.</p>

<h3>Postal Service to Communist Areas May Resume Within a Week</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The first practical result of the talks between Yan Huiqing's delegation and the Chinese Communist leaders will be the resumption of air transport to Peiping. It is understood that one of the concessions made by the Communists is to allow the Central Air Transport Corporation to begin mail transport soon, with passenger transport to be restored later. At least for the time being, no other airline planes will be allowed to go to Peiping. According to very reliable sources, the China National Aviation Corporation and the Civil Air Transport Brigade will not be allowed to fly to Peiping for the time being because these companies have investments from "American imperialists." Central Air Transport Corporation sources said that Peiping mail transport will resume within three to seven days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] Various departments and bureaus in Nanjing have been ordered to start accepting and sending mail to the Communist areas from the 28th. Registered express letters and small parcels can be accepted for Peiping and Tianjin, while only ordinary letters can be accepted for other areas.</p>

As for the technical issues, the Communist side hopes that this side will send personnel to Peiping to negotiate directly. The Directorate General of Posts is currently considering candidates, and they will depart for Peiping by air as soon as a decision is made.</p>
<h3>The Communist Party Plots to Control Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] New York 28th Radio: Hong Kong News, well-informed people from Taiwan said here that the Communist Party will certainly demand management of Taiwan when the Nationalists and Communists hold peace talks in the future. There are about 10,000 Communist Party members in Taiwan now, who are engaging in various activities, demanding management of the island. The Taiwanese people said that Xie Xuehong (transliteration), a female Communist leader in Taiwan, has gone to North China to negotiate. People here related to the Taiwanese Independence Movement say that recently about 200 "White Russians" have gone to Taiwan from China. They are ostensibly stateless refugees, but it is generally believed that there must be secret Soviet Union staff among them. That side of the people said that among the 6.5 million people in Taiwan, neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party are popular, but they are eager for the United States to clearly express its policy toward Taiwan. Those people welcome the views expressed by the United States that Kuomintang people should not go to Taiwan to take refuge, because the status of Taiwan has not yet been formally decided. Those people also said that if the Communist Party controls Taiwan, it will inevitably cause an event similar to the February 28, 1947 anti-Kuomintang riot.</p>

<h3>Presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan Hosted a Banquet to Welcome the Four Elder Statesmen of Peace; Yan and Shao Responded, Hoping to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, and the President of the Legislative Yuan, Tong Guanxian, jointly hosted a banquet for the Peace Delegation Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Shao Lizi and their entourage at the International Club at noon on the 28th. Government officials and some members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan were invited to attend. President Sun Ke, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Guangzhou, was also invited to participate on an ad hoc basis. The banquet was originally scheduled to begin at 12 noon, but because the two Presidents Yu and Tong and some government officials went to the airport to greet President Sun, it did not begin until 1:30 p.m. During the banquet, President Yu gave a speech, expressing his deep respect for the hard work of the four gentlemen of the Peace Delegation in their efforts for peace. He also expressed his apologies for not being able to arrive on time. President Tong said that the Peace Delegation's return south and President Sun Ke's arrival at this time have brought spring to the capital. Peace is now the unanimous desire of the people of the whole country and is necessary for the country today. The four representatives are working for peace, which is truly admirable and inspiring. He hoped that everyone would work for peace to promote its realization. Then, Yan and Shao of the Peace Delegation also stood up to speak. Yan, as a veteran diplomat, recalled diplomatic examples and emphasized that peace is a success, and failure to achieve peace is a failure. Yan said that after the "September 18th" Incident, he once met with Shigemitsu Mamoru and said to Shigemitsu: "Our diplomacy is a failure if we fail to achieve peace." Yan further said in a poetic tone: "Nanjing now has a Peace Gate, and Peiping also has a Peace Gate. We hope that the two Peace Gates can be connected so that the people can come and go freely." Shao Lizi gave a brief report on the origin and process of the Peace Delegation's trip to Peiping and concluded by saying, "Although there are still many difficulties in the future of peace talks, the hope is great." He hoped to overcome the difficulties and realize the hope. The banquet ended at 3 p.m. Those invited to attend today included Ju Zheng, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Zhizhong, He Yingqin, Xu Yongchang, Bai Chongxi, Gu Zhutong, Huang Shaohong, Wu Zhongxin, Zhong Tianxin, Wu Shangying, Gan Jiehou, Qiu Changwei, Li Chongshi, Chen Kewen, Fan Yuyu, Huang Yuren, Gu Fengxiang, Wang Xiangchen, Tian Yup, Cheng Siyuan, Wei Yongcheng, and others, totaling more than 30 people.</p>

Then, Sun shook hands with Yu, Bai, and others who came to greet him one by one and exchanged greetings. Sun wore a dark gray suit, a dark green overcoat, and dark glasses. When reporters asked Sun to make a statement, Wan Junhe, a specialist from the Information Bureau, stated on Sun's behalf that President Sun had already made a detailed statement in Guangzhou and had nothing to add today.

<h3>Two Major Responsibilities of the Reopened Legislative Yuan: Promote Peace and Reform Politics; Today's Regular Meeting Is Postponed; The Second Meeting Will Be Held on the Fourth; Sun Ke Will Attend to Make a Supplementary Report on the Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>[Our South China Dispatch on the 28th] The third session of the Legislative Yuan reopened in Nanjing on the morning of the 28th as scheduled in accordance with the Constitution. A total of 211 legislators who had arrived in Nanjing to report were present before the meeting, and 178 people attended the first meeting. No proposals were discussed at the meeting, waiting for others from various regions to arrive and participate. The weather was sunny and bright on the morning of the 28th. The National Assembly Hall, which had been deserted for two months, once again showed a noisy atmosphere. The members, being the first gathering of the year, attended promptly and exchanged greetings with colleagues they had not seen for two months. The meeting opened at 9:35 a.m., completing the reporting items in just 20 minutes. President Tong presided over the meeting and gave a speech of about 10 minutes, making the promotion of peace and political reform the major responsibilities of this session. In addition, the secretariat only read the minutes of the 33rd meeting of the second session, which were passed without objection. After President Tong gave a speech, he reported that the Yuan, in accordance with past regulations, meets twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. This meeting was held ahead of schedule on the 28th to comply with the provisions of the Constitution. Now, the report is received that the members from various regions are all on the way. Can the regular meeting date on March 3 be postponed once to wait for all colleagues to arrive? The audience applauded. The regular meeting on the morning of the 1st was decided to be postponed, and the Program Committee was scheduled to meet at 10:00 a.m. on the 1st to discuss the agenda for the second meeting. It is understood that as of the 28th, no proposals have been submitted by the members, only a few legal proposals have been submitted by the government.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold its second meeting on the 4th. Because President Sun Ke has arrived in Nanjing from Guangzhou, Sun will attend at that time to make a supplementary report on the policy guidelines.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian said in his speech at the first meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 28th: "Today is a bright spring day, and the holding of the first meeting of the third session of our Yuan symbolizes the bright and auspicious future of the country. It has been two months since our Yuan adjourned. During these two months, President Chiang resolutely retired to advocate peace, and Acting President Li took on the arduous task of promoting peace. This is a turning point in the survival of the country. At this time, the Legislative Yuan is reconvening in accordance with the law. The importance of our responsibility and the people's high expectations are self-evident. Today's century is the century of the people. Only by following the will of the people can the country have a way out, and only by exerting the power of the people can the government have power. What do the people hope for now? Undoubtedly, it is peace and political reform. The so-called peace is not stopping the current small bloodshed and preparing for the future large bloodshed. The so-called political reform is not just a change in government personnel, but the establishment of an incorruptible and capable political system that can truly represent the people and seek their welfare. How to ensure that freedom, democracy, and progress can be reasonably guaranteed, and how to put the country on the path of long-term stability and security, this is the mission that history has given to today's politicians, and it is also the important responsibility that our Legislative Yuan bears. From my personal point of view, this session of the Legislative Yuan is different from the previous two sessions. First, in today's situation where the people urgently need peace to resolve the crisis, we are discussing national affairs. Time does not allow us to discuss minor issues. Second, the agenda of this meeting seems to be more political than legal, requiring us to concentrate our efforts and study the most urgent major issues for the country. For example, how to promote comprehensive peace, how to determine future policy guidelines, how to increase administrative efficiency, how to stabilize finance and finance, how to improve the lives of soldiers and civilians, and so on. Our colleagues come from all corners and all levels of society, and we all have a deep understanding of the people's demands and the country's needs. I believe that with our collective wisdom, calm thinking, and sincere unity, we will be able to express public opinion, supervise the government, reverse the current crisis, and lay a foundation for lasting peace for the country. This is the common understanding of our colleagues and the hope of the people of the whole country. On the occasion of today's first gathering, I would like to offer a few words for the reference of all members."</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 28th] The Legislative Yuan reopened in Nanjing on the 28th, and the legislators staying in Guangzhou still insisted on opposing it. Most advocated postponing the reopening and deciding the reopening location by voting. Some legislators believe that as long as the government can achieve "glorious peace" as soon as possible, the time and location of the meeting are not a problem. There are currently more than 80 legislators staying in Guangzhou. According to qualified observers, although they are doing their best to advocate reopening in Guangzhou, the current number of people attending the meeting is small, and the possibility of singing a "counter-drama" is very small.</p>

<h3>Nanjing and Shanghai Security Agencies Cracked a Conspiracy of Terrorist Riot; Attempt to Detain Central Leaders to Create Chaos; Those Arrested Include Female National Representatives and Senior Officials of the Supervisory Agency and Police Department</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to information obtained from extremely reliable sources, the Nanjing security authorities cracked a plot half a month ago to subvert the government and affect the entire political situation; if this plan had been realized, the face of the political situation today would be different, and Nanjing and Shanghai might have fallen into the hands of rioters. The instigator of this riot plot was the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee led by Li Jishen. They wanted to use riots and coups to detain Acting President Li, Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, Commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Command Tang Enbo, Commander of the Capital Garrison Zhang Yaoming, Commander of the Military Police Zhang Dang, Director of the Capital Police Department Huang Zhenwu, Mayor of Nanjing Teng Jie, and other government leaders in Nanjing, in order to overthrow the Nationalist government, control the military headquarters, and welcome the Communist army across the river as future political capital. However, due to the lack of secrecy, it was detected by the Nanjing security authorities, who immediately took effective emergency response actions to suppress it in time, arresting Meng Shiheng (a member of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, currently a supervisor of the Supervisory Commissioner's Office in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region), Xu Zhiyuan, and Xia Huaying, a female National Assembly representative who participated in the plan, Ma Guangyun, director of the Central District Police Bureau of the capital, and others in Nanjing and Shanghai. It is understood that this major political and military espionage case also involves some government officials, and the security authorities are currently tracking down and interrogating them. It is expected that after the entire case comes to an end, it will be publicly announced.</p>
<p>Six Conspiracy Steps</p>
<p>It is understood that the organization launched this plan after the Chinese Communist radio announced the list of 43 government war criminals on January 25. When Nanjing implemented the evacuation of public school personnel and many senior government officials left Nanjing, and Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, and other Shanghai Peace Delegation members flew north, they accelerated their efforts, taking six steps to try to overthrow the Nationalist government, control the capital, welcome the Communist army across the river, occupy the Nanjing-Shanghai line, and then achieve the goal of seizing political power. The six steps they set, according to the arrested, were: (1) Mobilize military police and spy agents lurking within the government to occupy Nanjing airport, railway stations, wharves, communication equipment, and bridges on the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou national highway; (2) Imprison important party, government, and military leaders below Acting President Li in Nanjing, control all important organs, and cut off all contact between the capital and the outside world; (3) Divide local forces, creating a state of anarchy in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou; (4) Gather underground elements against the government to welcome the Communist army across the river, first occupying the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line; (5) Disrupt the rear order, create a state of terror, divide and occupy various places; (6) Cause all parties to lose contact, take the opportunity to issue false orders, and achieve the ultimate goal of seizing the entire regime. After the government cracked this major conspiracy, firstly because the people of the whole country eagerly hope for peace and fear that the announcement will affect the future of peace talks, and secondly because the spies involved in this case were too widespread, in order to avoid criminals escaping, the initial strict ban on leaks was imposed. It is said that in addition to the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee and other anti-government elements, those who instigated this conspiracy also included a few senior officials lurking in public opinion organs and within the government.</p>
<p>The security agencies of the capital and Shanghai jointly cracked this shocking riot conspiracy, and the process was quite tortuous and laborious, like a detective novel. From a subtle clue, through meticulous deployment, counter-espionage personnel were dispatched to penetrate the core organization of the other side, detect the entire plan, and then launch a swift arrest operation, detaining the instigators and participants one by one. As for the exact number of people arrested, the official side has so far remained silent, but foreign rumors say that it has reached more than 10 or 20 people.</p>
<p>The First Person Arrested</p>
<p>The government's arrest work began roughly on February 12 or 13. By the 17th, well-informed people in the capital had already spread the main points of the case. On the 18th, the United Press Nanjing telegram first published an interview with Qin Xiuqing, a female National Assembly representative from Songjiang Province, Northeast China, who told the agency's reporter that after her husband, Meng Shiheng, was arrested in Shanghai, she herself was placed under house arrest by government agents in her residence in Nanjing on February 14. Although she cannot be held responsible for her husband's political activities, she has lost her freedom and is under house arrest. According to the United Press reporter, three friends of Qin Xiuqing visited the residence and were all arrested. One of them was a National Assembly representative. The agency also said that when the agency's reporter visited Qin Xiuqing's residence, a plainclothes officer was on the scene, who confirmed that he was ordered to be here to rescue Qin Anshi. The monitor was also listening quietly when the reporter talked with Qin. It is said that Qin has secretly sent out a letter, which was addressed to Acting President Li, stating her situation. Qin Xiuqing also said that her husband, Meng Tuheng, had been escorted from Shanghai to Nanjing after being arrested and was still being detained.

<h3>Starting from Mr. Anonymous's Support for Education</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's 38th-year spring reader scholarship fund aims for 5 million yuan. After fundraising for many days, only a little less than one-third has been collected. This is certainly due to our lack of effort, but also due to the turbulent times and people's unease. We were preparing to allocate the funds according to the amount raised when, unexpectedly, a reader, Mr. "Anonymous," generously donated 1 million yuan, bringing the total to half of the targeted amount. Subsequently, he personally raised another 2.5 million yuan, completing the targeted amount for this year's reader scholarship fund. Furthermore, it was reported that the News Daily recently held the "Red Gaole" scholarship fund on behalf of Yuhua Tobacco Company. When the list of recipients was announced, the number of accepted applicants was less than the number of applicants. Mr. Anonymous also donated 2 million yuan, allowing more than 800 impoverished students to have the opportunity to continue their studies. Such enthusiasm for supporting education and benefiting impoverished students is commendable, especially the spirit of doing good without seeking recognition, which is rare in today's Shanghai and deserves the respect of the community.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai is known as the economic center of the country, in the past three years, it has been affected by the war, with capital from all over the country converging on the city. On the other hand, due to malignant inflation, an abnormal development has occurred, with the poor becoming poorer and the rich becoming richer, concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. However, most of these few people have a chaotic mindset, indulging in personal enjoyment, seeking only self-interest at the expense of others, and even refusing to pluck a hair to benefit the world. We only need to look at the various social relief donations in recent years, such as special relief donations, winter relief funds, and the recent aerial fundraising scholarships, and the results of the fundraising have mostly failed to reach the intended target. In this kind of deteriorating and decadent social atmosphere, Mr. Anonymous has been able to repeatedly support scholarship donations, which is even more commendable. Our newspaper calls him the "Scholarship Elder," which he truly deserves.</p>
<p>It is said that this Mr. "Anonymous" also used the name "Bitter Qi Master" to regularly donate to support education during the War of Resistance. According to his own statement: "I deeply sympathize with the experience of losing the opportunity to study in my youth. I have established many free schools in Shanghai, Ningbo, and other places to widely accept tuition-free students, but I always feel that there is not enough porridge for everyone, which is difficult to fulfill my wishes, so I can only do my best to do it." This means that his motivation for promoting education and supporting students is due to a deep sense of the pain of losing the opportunity to study. Therefore, he extends his own experience to others, so that impoverished students can study with peace of mind. He is not doing it for fame or gain, nor does it have that effect; he is purely based on the mentality of feeling hungry when others are hungry and feeling drowned when others are drowned, and a broad sympathy for young people who have lost the opportunity to study.</p>
<p>Originally, compassion is the opposite of selfishness and is the source of human creativity for society. The "benevolence" advocated by Confucius and Mencius, the "universal love" advocated by Mozi, the "agape" promoted by Christ, and the "great compassion" expounded by Buddha all take the sympathy for human beings and even for all living beings as the starting point, expand it, and establish lofty beliefs. They and their followers, for the sake of practicing this belief, sacrificed their own possessions to help others, or sacrificed their lives for righteousness. They did not hesitate to wear out their heads or grind down their heels, and they would be willing to be smashed to pieces. Ancient sages and virtuous people had this spirit, religious believers had this spirit, and revolutionary and anti-Japanese martyrs also had this spirit. However, what is lacking in today's society, especially in the extravagant and intoxicated Shanghai, is precisely this spirit of self-sacrifice and self-denial for the benefit of others!</p>
<p>Morality often does not have fixed standards due to differences in time and space. However, there is a common basic principle that is consistent throughout ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad: it is giving, not taking; it is giving, not possessing; it is helping others, not enriching oneself. Only in this way can one obtain peace and light in one's heart. The so-called "doing good is the greatest joy," the so-called "helping others is the foundation of happiness," and the so-called "giving alms without dwelling on appearances brings immeasurable merit" are explanations of this basic principle. John Stuart Mill also said: "Those who seek happiness must place their hearts on some object outside their own happiness, that is, on the cause of the improvement of mankind." So, simply put, if people want to gain happiness, they must sacrifice their own private happiness, promote the public happiness of the masses, and even increase the common happiness of all sentient beings in the ten directions, and then can they have true happiness.</p>
<p>But looking back at our society, wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few people, forming the so-called "nouveau riche" peculiar to chaotic times. They use speculative and cunning methods to deprive most common people of their livelihoods. When people are hungry and cold, they are well-fed and well-clothed; when people are busy saving lives, they indulge in pleasure. Not only do they lack a social concept and national consciousness, but they also lose even basic sympathy for humanity, let alone for all sentient beings? Mr. Anonymous is alert but unwilling to take credit for it. After our extensive inquiries, he is just a businessman. Just because he suffered the pain of losing the opportunity to study in his childhood, he can see the pain of others who have lost the opportunity to study. Therefore, he wholeheartedly helps young people who have lost the opportunity to study. Furthermore, as for those who are poor and have no one to turn to, as long as he knows about it and is able to help, he is happy to help. We think about the wealthy and powerful people of today, who have all directly or indirectly received support from the government or help from society in the past, and have even enjoyed special favors from the state. It can be said that the reason why they have their current status is that the country and the people gave them the opportunity. However, at this moment, the lives of the masses are in such suffering, and the fate of the country is facing unprecedented dangers, but we have not heard them show any compassion, nor have we seen them show any willingness to contribute their wealth. Comparing them to Mr. Anonymous, asking themselves in the quiet of the night, how can they not be ashamed to die!</p>
<p>On the day when our newspaper's spring reader scholarship fundraising work comes to an end, we would like to thank all the donors and Mr. Anonymous, and we hope that everyone will promote compassion from now on, be enthusiastic about social relief, and generously donate to the country, work together to overcome this unprecedented crisis.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu Gradually Move Southward, Gathering More Than 30,000 People Near Yangzhou; Main Force of Chen Yi's Troops on the Jinpu Front Also Advancing by Land and Water</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] According to information obtained here, Communist troops are gathering near Yangzhou. In addition to the original 3,000 local Communist troops, about 30,000 people have arrived in the Xiannvmiao and Yiling areas of Yangzhou in recent days. More than 30,000 of their follow-up troops are continuing to move south from Huaiyin via Gaoyou and Baoying by land and water. As for their designations, according to investigations, they are Chen Yi's 10th, 11th, and 12th columns. Furthermore, the Communist troops between Tianchang and Yangzhou are also busy moving. The 239th, Bohai Quick, and other five columns originally stationed in the Tianchang and southwest areas of Gaoyou Lake are Chen Yi's troops.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Pukou, 28th Dispatch] The Communist troops on the southern section of the Jinpu Front, including Chen Yi's 1st, 4th, New 8th, and Liangguang columns, are still gathering in the Mingguang and Chuxian areas. However, the Liangguang column is also gradually moving south to Wuyi and Jieshou. According to a certain authoritative military observer, after the Qinglongji battle ended on January 10, Chen Yi's troops have been fully replenished in the past 50 days. At this time, the main force will move south along the three lines of the railway, canal, and highway, possibly launching an attack on the Nationalist army's bridgehead positions north of the Yangtze River, in order to sweep all areas north of the Yangtze River, create a favorable situation, and put pressure on the government to make concessions, so as to gain a more favorable position in the peace talks. However, the observer repeatedly solemnly told reporters that although the Communist troops have completed their replenishment, their preparations for crossing the Yangtze River have not yet been completed. Therefore, although they can launch an offensive against the Nationalist army's bridgehead positions north of the Yangtze River at present, it is too early to talk about crossing the river.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Pukou, 28th Dispatch] A unit of more than 500 local Communist Lianghuai Independent Brigade harassed the Nationalist army positions in the Dongxi Ge area from Wuyi on the night of the 27th and were repelled before dawn. Another unit of more than 100 people attacked Getangji, more than 20 miles northeast of Pukou from Liuhe, and were also repelled.</p>
<h3>Rumors About the Deployment of Feng Zhi'an and Liu Ruming's Troops to Qingdao Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Since Feng Zhi'an was appointed as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, there are seven Deputy Commanders-in-Chief in his department, including Li Yannian, Liu Ruming, Wan Jianfan, Shen Shaozhou, Chen Daqing, and Ding Zhipan. The headquarters is still stationed in Nanjing. As for Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, he frequently travels between Beijing, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, and Hangzhou due to business needs. During Tang's absence from Beijing, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Wan will act on his behalf. The rumor that Feng Zhi'an and Liu Ruming's troops have been deployed to Qingdao is inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<h3>Eastern Gansu is Very Stable; Ma Jiyuan Will Return to His Defense Area Within Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 28th Dispatch] Ma Jiyuan, Commander of the Eastern Gansu Corps, arrived in Lanzhou from Xining on the evening of the 27th and will return to his defense area within days. According to him, everything is as usual in Qinghai. However, this year's conscription was completed entirely within a week, with more than 2,000 people voluntarily joining the volunteer army, showing the people's awareness of protecting their homeland and stabilizing the rear. He then expressed his opinion on the future of the Northwest, saying: "Today is the best opportunity for the Northwest to become self-reliant and seek progress. If we can seize this good opportunity, the future of the Northwest will be infinitely bright, otherwise, it is unpredictable." Finally, he said: "Eastern Gansu has been stable recently, and the self-defense forces are becoming more and more substantial."</p>
<h3>People in Various Parts of Northern Jiangsu Evade Communist Conscription</h3>
<p>More Than 10,000 People Gather in Liuxu</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 28th Dispatch] People in various parts of northern Jiangsu have recently been fleeing south to avoid Communist conscription of stretchers. It is reported that there are more than 10,000 refugees gathered in Liuxu alone. The authorities have ordered the troops stationed in the area to allow and assist them in crossing the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Cares About Political Prisoners</h3>
<p>Orders Subordinate Provincial and Municipal Governments to Report</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th Dispatch] Director Zhang of the Pacification Headquarters is very concerned about the issue of political prisoners. He has telegraphed the provincial and municipal governments in his jurisdiction, ordering them to report all political prisoners arrested in their respective provinces and cities to the Pacification Headquarters, regardless of whether they have been tried or not, for processing.</p>
<h3>Change of Garrison Commander in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Li Tiehan Resigns, Ye Zhao Takes Over</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 28th Dispatch] Li Tiehan, the Garrison Commander of Guangzhou, has resigned. The Pacification Headquarters has reassigned Lieutenant General Ye Zhao to take over the vacancy. Ye will take office on the 1st.</p>
<h3>Another Change in Yongshun, Hunan; The Provincial Government is Applying Both Suppression and Appeasement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 28th Dispatch] Cao Zengya, an adjunct to the Yongshun Self-Defense Corps, coerced his troops to rebel. Later, Cao returned to the city after persuasion from all sides. The incident could have come to an end, but the situation has recently changed again. The rebels have raised the banner of the "Hunan-West People's Anti-Oppression Army" and organized the "Hunan-West People's Anti-Oppression Action Committee." The main reason for Cao's rebellion was that Li Mo'an, director of the 17th Pacification District, sent personnel to Yongshun to reorganize the self-defense corps, which aroused the rebels. Therefore, the rebels posted many slogans such as "Down with Li Mo'an, who oppresses the people of western Hunan." Nie Pengsheng, the special commissioner of the 8th District, is also under Cao's "troop protection." It is reported that a part of the rebels, about 2,000 people with guns, has fled to Wusu in the upper reaches of Yuanling to cause trouble. There are also traces of rebels in Chachuan between Taoyuan and Yuanling. In addition to sending troops to block and suppress the rebels, the provincial government is still doing its best to adopt a policy of appeasement.</p>

Chairman Ding delivered a speech on the theme of "Abiding by One's Duties in Chaotic Times."

He then warned his colleagues to unanimously safeguard the interests of the country and the nation, be loyal to the country, and serve the people.

<h3>The Communist Side in Peiping Forbids Foreign Reporters From Operating; The U.S. State Department Discusses Countermeasures; The Communist Party's Attitude Toward Foreigners Gradually Becomes Clear, According to the United Press</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th Dispatch] State Department spokesman McGruder said on the 27th that the State Department is studying the Chinese Communist Party's action of prohibiting all foreign reporters from filing and reporting news from Beiping. He said that the order also prohibits the U.S. Information Service in Beiping from issuing news releases. The activity has been suspended pending possible policy changes from China. U.S. Consul General in Beiping Clubb told the State Department that he had received a mimeographed notice signed by the chairman and vice chairman of the Beiping Military Control Commission ordering the prohibition of the release of news. Clubb said that he knew the same formal notice had been sent to foreign reporters stationed in Beiping.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The U.S. Embassy here confirmed today that the U.S. Information Service in Beiping had been ordered by the local Communist authorities to stop issuing news releases, but an embassy spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>[United Press, Our City Dispatch] What the Communist Party will do with foreigners in general, especially foreign enterprises, in its occupied areas, is incomprehensible to the general public. Now at least these two questions have been answered. The Communist Party's action in Beiping to prohibit foreign reporters from sending telegrams may or may not be a temporary measure from military control to political control. The Communist Party did not state this in its official announcement. The second point is the reply to the Mutual Economic Cooperation Agency's protest against the seizure of flour in the Beiping warehouse. On February 19, the Mutual Economic Cooperation Agency announced that the director of the Mutual Economic Cooperation Agency's Beiping branch, Davis, had formally protested to the Beiping Military Control Commission against "the illegal removal of some bags of flour from the Mutual Economic Cooperation Agency." On the night of the 27th, the Communist Party radio station replied that this was no longer the affair of the Mutual Economic Cooperation Agency, because these 6,666 bags of flour had already belonged to the Kuomintang when the Military Control Commission took over. These flours have been included in the list of property handed over to the Beiping Military Control Commission by the director of the Kuomintang's "U.S. Aid Association" in Beiping. Therefore, the receipt of these flours has nothing to do with the Chinese branch of the Mutual Economic Cooperation Agency.</p>

<h3>On the Closure of the Peiping World Daily, Cheng Shewo Issues a Statement, Saying That It Can Strengthen His Belief in Fighting for Freedom of the Press</h3>
<p>[Our City Dispatch] Cheng Shewo, president of the Peiping World Daily, recently issued a statement on the closure of the newspaper by the Peiping Communist Military Control Commission, as follows:</p>
<p>"From the broadcast in northern Shaanxi, I learned that the Peiping World Daily, which I painstakingly founded and has a long history in North China, was closed by the Peiping Communist Military Control Commission on the 25th of this month. I left Peiping at the end of September last year. In December, the Communist army suddenly attacked Tianjin and Peiping, and transportation was cut off. After the Communist army entered Peiping, my colleagues in Peiping could not voluntarily stop publishing due to safety reasons. Since January, the order in Peiping has gradually stabilized, and the Communist army has controlled the overall situation. There is no longer a need to forcibly "pretend to be progressive" for the original newspapers. Therefore, dozens of newspapers in the city were closed one by one. However, the Peiping World Daily was uniquely extended to the very end. Therefore, I should not express resentment or anger towards the Communist Party's closure of the Peiping World Daily. I can only blame it for being too good. Especially in the closure of all private newspapers, the World Daily was uniquely singled out and given a lengthy broadcast stating the reasons. Such importance given to the World Daily makes me feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Facts Cannot Be Distorted</p>
<p>Since the World Daily was founded in 1924, it has been persecuted under almost every dynasty. The so-called closures have occurred no less than dozens of times, and my personal arrests and imprisonment are also equal in number. When Peiping fell in 1937, the newspaper was plundered by the Japanese invaders. When it resumed publication after the victory, in the resumption declaration that I signed, I painfully told both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party that if the Communist Party did not change its policies and still specialized in killing, arson, fighting, and riots as the government said, the government's use of force would be unstoppable; if the Kuomintang could not deeply realize and thoroughly reform, and still followed the old ways, procrastinated, and was corrupt and decadent, the people's revolution would be inevitable. Since the victory, every proposition of the World Daily has been based on this principle. Even today, I have not found any reason to feel remorse under the guns and bayonets of any dynasty. If the Communist Party recognizes this as "a non-partisan mask," then I would rather wear this mask for the rest of my life. Fortunately, the past comments of the World Daily, word by word, are fair and kind. The broad masses of North China have long established their opinions, and there is no need for my辩证, nor can anyone distort them. More than 20 years ago, I was just a scholar who founded this newspaper with only a few hundred dollars. Until today, when it was closed by the Communist Party, it has been able to have a large scale and a large readership among the private newspapers in North China. The reason is obvious to everyone. However, the World Daily has never accepted any support from any dynasty, nor has it had any relationship with them. Even the low-interest cultural loans that were available in various places under the rule of the Kuomintang government were also rejected. In the assets of the World Daily closed by the Communist Party, every gear of every machine, every character of every stereotype, was obtained by me and hundreds of colleagues rack their brains and shed blood and sweat. Although the World Daily cannot temporarily provide超然 independent comments and prompt and reliable news to the broad masses of North China, the encouragement given to the World Daily for its growth and nourishment by the broad masses of readers in North China in the past few decades can strengthen my belief and the beliefs of countless news warriors in continuing to fight hard for freedom of the press. Recalling the War of Resistance, not only was my Peiping World Daily destroyed by the enemy, but all the other newspapers that I ran in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong were also plundered one after another. Hankou and Guilin fell before they could be published. I finally resumed publication of the World Daily in Chongqing on the eve of victory. I deeply believe that the world is so big that the Communist Party can close my Peiping World Daily, but it cannot close my will to devote my life to the news business and promote justice and resist violence.</p>
<p>Slander Does Not Need to Be 正</p>
<p>As for the Communist Party's broadcast accusing me of being a CC member of the Kuomintang, this kind of malicious rumor does not need me to defend it. If the broadcaster does not destroy his own amazing achievements in intelligence work, a little thought about the current situation of various factions and the ironclad fact that I never participated in any faction will make him laugh. Fortunately, every dynasty has the innate privilege of manufacturing titles and slandering dissidents. "National Special Agents" and "Bandit Spies" are the same in different places. This is an unchanging law throughout ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, and it is especially true today. I can only lament the increasing decline of political morality."</p>

<h3>Terrifying Conspiracy of Riots - Continued from Page 1</h3>
<p>The Night of Rue de Courbet This United Press report has aroused widespread attention. According to relevant sources, the person in charge of the special operations in five provinces and three cities was Xu Zhiyuan. The confession implicated as many as 70 to 80 people, including some government officials. Xu, a native of Sixian, Anhui, graduated from the sixth class of the Central Military Academy. He served as deputy editor of the Nanjing China Daily and magistrate of Sixian, Anhui. Last year, he was introduced to the Supervisory Committee of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region as an investigation specialist and had close ties with Meng Shiheng. Later, the authorities also discovered that the head of the women's department of the special operations organization was Xia Bengying. Xia, a native of Anhui, was a female National Assembly representative and graduated from Chaoyang University in Beiping. She was quite active in the Party and Youth League in her early years. Her appointment as a National Assembly representative was generated by a national women's organization. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, she cohabited with Zhu Yunshan, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, for some time. After the victory, Zhu went to work in the "Liberated Area." It is said that he has recently taken office as the Secretary-General of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang under Li Jishen. When the Communist Party's radio station announced the declaration of 55 democratic figures on the current situation in late January, Zhu Yunshan was also listed. Xia came to Shanghai during the evacuation of public education personnel. She was arrested on February 15, after the curfew, at Xu's residence on Rue de Courbet in Hongkou. National Assembly representatives from Anhui who stayed in Shanghai, unaware of the truth, visited the local security authorities to inquire about the reasons for the arrest, but were unable to obtain any information at that time.</p>
<p>In addition, Ma Guangyun, the director of the Central District Police Department of the capital, was arrested in Nanjing. It is said that Ma participated in the riots and attempted to use force to capture Huang Zhenwu, the director of the Capital Police Department, and then control the capital. The current director of the Central District Police Department has been replaced by Ouyang Jing, the deputy superintendent of the Capital Police Department. (Ma had fabricated a news story that Director Huang had absconded and was detained at the airport, which was given to Zhao Lingyun, a female reporter from the Nanjing Renbao, through the bureau's police inspector. The newspaper, unaware, published a report on January 31, "Director Huang Flees and Fails, Arrested by Subordinates at the Airport." Ma's purpose was to use the newspaper to damage Director Huang's reputation, so that the police officers would become dissatisfied with Huang and expand into petitions, and even strikes, to cooperate with this conspiracy. Later, the police inspector was also arrested.) It is said that there are also a few military police personnel currently responsible for maintaining public order among those arrested. Therefore, the plan on how to capture Acting President Li in this major conspiracy can be said to be not only detailed, but also easy to implement. The initial intention was to wait until the first step was completed, and then proceed step by step according to the above plan.</p>
<p>Continued Investigation Another source claims that a certain government agency learned around January that anti-government elements were plotting riots. However, the materials obtained were mostly fragmented and incomplete. Later, a certain capable intelligence officer in the government used all kinds of methods to infiltrate this special operations organization and took on counter-espionage work before gradually obtaining clues. This conspiracy was orchestrated by Meng Shiheng, who was hiding in Shanghai. Therefore, after painstaking efforts, it was discovered that a certain honest elder was a close friend of Meng. A certain security agency in Nanjing asked the elder to act as an introducer, introducing someone as Acting President Li's representative to negotiate peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party with Meng Shiheng. Before and up to the present, the elder did not know that Meng had joined this special operations organization and was engaged in a riot to subvert the government, nor did he know that the representative of Acting President Li was actually a disguised figure sent by the government's security agency as a counter-spy. Initially, the elder was invited to a certain security agency in Nanjing. After the agency informed him of the purpose of the summons, the elder said that whether Meng Shiheng was in Nanjing or not had to be investigated before he could know the truth. At this time, the security agency already knew that Meng had left Nanjing and came to Shanghai, but the only difficulty was that they did not know his Shanghai residence. However, in order to prevent the elder from suspecting anything else, they agreed to let him investigate before making a decision. The next day, the elder replied, saying that Meng had gone to Shanghai. The security agency asked him to write a letter or use a long-distance call to introduce Acting President Li's representative to Meng for a brief discussion. The elder believed that the matter concerned peace talks and was of great importance. It seemed difficult to succeed unless he went in person, so he decided to accompany Acting President Li's representative to Shanghai himself. After arriving in Shanghai, the elder and Acting President Li's representative agreed that he would first go to Meng's residence to obtain Meng Shiheng's consent to the principles of peace talks before acting as an introducer. In fact, when the elder went to Meng's place, the security agency of the capital, with the assistance of the security personnel of this city, had already secretly sent people to follow the elder. When the elder finished talking with Meng and went out, the security personnel of a certain security agency in this city arrested Meng. When the elder returned to the hotel and told Acting President Li's representative that Meng was willing to meet him, the news of Meng's arrest also arrived at the same time. The elder did not understand why, and on the way back to Nanjing, he repeatedly begged Acting President Li's representative to ask Acting President Li to order the Shanghai security agency to release him. As a result of Meng Shiheng's arrest, the conspiracy of this major riot and all its plans were fully known, and Meng's superior secret instructions were found. Based on this clue, three giants who were responsible for the top decision-making of the five-person group, namely organization, propaganda, and military-industrial sports, were also captured. These three main figures were arrested by the security agency after Meng Shiheng was escorted to Nanjing and confessed. They were then escorted to Nanjing by special plane and brought to justice. In addition, there have been quite a few people arrested in connection with this case in recent days, but the relevant parties declined to disclose the number, but stated that the government is unwilling to continue arresting people at this time, but for those who attempt to subvert the government through special operations, the government has no choice but to take appropriate action for self-defense.</p>

<h3>Southeast Asia Anti-Communist Alliance May Be Established at New Delhi Conference; Dominions Will Determine Aid Steps for Burma; Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu Calls on National People to Be Loyal to Their Country</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 28th Broadcast: British Dominions met in New Delhi today, ostensibly to discuss the situation in Burma, but according to relevant sources, the scope of the meeting will be expanded, and the formulation of a Southeast Asian regional defense plan will gradually take shape at this meeting. The person said that among the Dominions, India already has the strength to become an anti-communist bulwark. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt said that since Britain is currently busy dealing with European affairs, the Pacific Dominions should be led by Australia. Evatt and Australian Prime Minister Chifley both believe that because the Communist Party has succeeded in China and communists are constantly infiltrating South Pacific countries, all countries must take appropriate action immediately. Australian people believe that the only hope for Southeast Asian democratic countries today lies in maintaining good friendship with a powerful India, and they can no longer rely on the assistance of Dutch and French troops. Australian people also said that based on the experience of the last war, it can be seen that Britain is actually unable to send large armies on expeditions overseas. Chifley praised Nehru and considered him one of the six great men of the present era. It is widely believed that an organization similar to the Western European Union may be established at today's meeting to resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 27th] Pakistan does not intend to participate in the informal meeting on the situation in Burma in New Delhi tomorrow, but intends to participate in any formal consultations in the future. It is believed that the Burmese government recently requested a loan from Britain, so it must state its diplomatic policy among the British Dominions. The purpose of the meeting is threefold: first, to plan ways to restore order in Burma and support the Thakin Nu government; second, to mediate disputes and prohibit the supply of arms or military intervention; and third, to provide economic assistance to protect the safety of Burmese rice exports. Nehru will represent India at the meeting, and Ceylon will be represented by its High Commissioner to India.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 28th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt arrived here by plane on the night of the 27th and will represent Australia at the conference of British Dominions on the situation in Burma held here. Evatt had a long meeting with Indian Prime Minister Nehru on the morning of the 28th.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Yangon, 27th] The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma led more than 10,000 Burmese people this morning to hold a loyal citizens' rally at Bandula Square. Thakin Nu served as the chairman of the conference. He delivered a speech calling on the people of the country to be loyal to the motherland, because the Union of Burma is currently encountering the most difficult years since its independence. He revealed the recent riots by the Karen Communist Party and the White Flag People's Volunteer Army, which caused the government losses of more than 20 million rupees and nearly 30,000 military and civilian casualties.</p>
<p>[United Press, Yangon, 28th] The government said yesterday that there will be a major war in central Burma, and government troops have launched a counteroffensive in an attempt to retake Tatshi, an important railway junction and the headquarters of the Northern Burma Army.

Infighting broke out between the Karen and the Communist Party in the Bago area, and they fought fiercely.</p>
<h3>Nehru Attends Parliament, Criticizes Indian Communist Party Rebellion, Government Decides to Take Resolute Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 28th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru told Parliament on the 28th that the robbery in the Calcutta area at the end of last week and the widespread destruction throughout India were Communist Party actions aimed at overthrowing the government by force. Nehru said that in the past ten days, a total of 870 communists have been arrested for riots that are "close to open rebellion." The government's resolute measures against "murderers, arsonists, and saboteurs" will continue. He continued: "The attitude taken by the Communist Party is not only openly hostile to the government, but also can be described as close to open rebellion. The Lower House is well aware of the Communist Party rebellion in neighboring countries. Some people in India are trying to incite the people to actively rebel, and this is believed to be an extension of the same policy." He also said that the robbery in Calcutta by mobs on the 26th and 27th, as well as the Communist Party's efforts to brew a national railway strike despite the resolution of the Railway Workers' Association not to strike, are actually related to the Communist Party's policies in various parts of the Far East. While Nehru was attending Parliament, news came from Calcutta that at least 18 people had been killed in clashes with Communist-led mobs since the 26th, including three British and two Indian police officers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Mumbai, 28th] Late on the 27th, the Indian Strike Committee decided to cancel the strike and designated March 1 as the date for resumption of work. The strike of workers in Mumbai has lasted for two weeks.</p>

<p>[United Press, Moscow, 27th] The Soviet Communist Party's newspaper "Pravda" criticized the Indian government on the 27th for arresting 2,600 "democratic figures" under the direct pressure of American financial interests. According to a TASS report from New Delhi, the delegation of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in India is lending money to India at a "high interest rate of 4.5%." The delegation also informed the Indian government that the high interest rate is due to the "Communist crisis." "If this crisis is eliminated, the interest rate will be reduced," the newspaper said. "Obviously, the suppression of the Communist Party and democratic organizations is closely linked to American pressure."</p>

The South Korean government should understand that there is a limit to the sacrifices that the Austrian people can bear. In order to achieve greater mutual understanding, I hope that the South Korean delegation will accept this realistic basis."</p>

<h3>British Labour Party Policy Determined: Expanding Nationalization Plan for Basic Industries; Communist Party Attacks Government for Relying on Anti-Soviet Alliance</h3>
<p>[London, Feb. 27th (Associated Press)] According to reliable sources tonight: The British Labour Party has decided to continue expanding its nationalization plan for basic industries, although there are exceptions for electors. Labour leaders and key cabinet members, including Prime Minister Attlee, held a secret two-day meeting at Shanklin on the Isle of Wight. The nationalization of sugar refineries and raw materials has been included in the tentative platform for the 1950 general election, and the chemical industry may also be added to the nationalization plan. The Labour Party hopes to regain the overwhelming victory of 1950.</p>
<p>Few details of the meeting have been released, but it is rumored that the shipbuilding industry will not be nationalized, largely due to opposition from trade unions, and flour mills will also be temporarily excluded. However, the Labour Party has reviewed twenty or thirty industries to determine which are most suitable for nationalization, and there may be some unexpected developments before 1950. The Labour government has so far nationalized overseas airlines, the Bank of England, submarine cables and wireless communications, coal mines, railways, inland navigation, and electricity industries, and the steel nationalization bill has been submitted to Parliament. Deputy Prime Minister Morrison and Health Minister Bevan, who lead the left and right wings of the cabinet, did not have divided opinions at the meeting, unlike when the nationalization of the steel industry was proposed last year.</p>
<p>[London, Feb. 27th (Agence France-Presse)] The British Communist Party issued a declaration today, strongly criticizing the government for relying on the North Atlantic Treaty, attempting to unite Wall Street's plutocrats, the imperialism of Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, the fascism of Spain and Portugal, the reactionism of Turkey, and the royalism of Greece into an evil alliance to fight against the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries, the colonial people, and the working class of Europe. The Soviet Union has always prioritized peace and will never wage aggressive wars. The statement also demanded that all American troops withdraw from Britain and that Stalin, Truman, and Attlee immediately choose a location to meet and discuss troop reductions and the prohibition of atomic bombs. It then criticized the Marshall Plan and urged Britain to quickly engage in new trade negotiations with the Soviet Union. Finally, it announced that the Communist Party plans to nominate one hundred candidates in the upcoming general election to participate in the competition. It also stated that the Communist Party's domestic front would advocate for increased wages, large reductions in profits, increased taxes on the wealthy, and the construction of four hundred houses each year. It is noted that the Communist Party currently holds only two seats in the 640-seat House of Commons.</p>
<h3>Churchill's Autocratic Style: Conservative Party Losing Public Support</h3>
<p>[London, Feb. 27th (Associated Press)] Some Conservative Party leaders in Britain are now discussing removing Churchill from his role as the main drafter of the party platform. The Conservative Party's setback in the South Hammersmith constituency by-election last week dealt a major blow to the party, believing that Churchill's competitive speeches denouncing the government's misconduct led to a loss of public support. Members of Parliament in the party are extremely uneasy, believing that Churchill should have a chief of staff to develop parliamentary and election strategies. Former Foreign Secretary Eden was originally the second most important figure in the Conservative Party, but informed sources say that Churchill insists on "playing a one-man show."</p>

<h3>MGM Accelerates Film Production: "Crime Record" Requires Only 28 Days; Van Johnson Memorizes Dialogue All Day Long</h3>

<h3>Nordic Countries Inclined Towards Western Alliance; North Atlantic Treaty a Matter of Time; Soviet Union Covets Norway's Rich Atomic Resources</h3>
<p>[Oslo, Feb. 27th (Associated Press)] High-level diplomatic sources predicted today that the Scandinavian countries, including traditionally neutral Sweden, are likely to join the future North Atlantic Treaty within the next six months. Norway is already prepared to join, and the main political party in Denmark, the Social Democrats, has called on the government to move closer to the West for military security. Key figures in Sweden also privately acknowledge that Sweden cannot maintain its delicate balancing act between the East and West blocs for long. Isolation is becoming increasingly impossible, and the only option is to sympathize with the West. Sweden will likely join the North Atlantic Alliance before this autumn. If the Soviet Union takes any action against Finland, Sweden's participation may be accelerated even further.</p>
<p>[Oslo, Feb. 27th (Associated Press)] The Soviet Union's desire to isolate Norway from Western countries is quite intense, and there is a secret reason for this, namely that Norway is an atomic nation. In a secret laboratory in Norway, there is already an atomic pile that stores nuclear fission energy. Heavy water is essential for atomic research. The Norsk Hydro plant in the remote mountains of southern Norway already produces it in large quantities. Uranium mines are also being mined in central Norway, and there is more than one city equipped with atomic smashers. The Soviet counterintelligence agencies are well aware of this, and how this affects Soviet policy towards Norway now and in the future is a major question. The Soviet Union's attention to Norwegian atomic research is expressed in different ways. The Communist Party does not hide its desire to obtain this information, and Soviet Ambassador Afanasiev is prepared to welcome any incidental reports from Norwegian scientists, but so far has not gained anything. As far as outsiders know, Norwegian scientists do not want to play with atomic bombs, and their research is focused on how to make atomic energy available for peaceful purposes. Even in this area, the Soviet Union has endless curiosity.</p>

<h3>Landlord Collecting Rent in US Dollars: Tenant Requests Ban; First Case Deserving of Attention; Land Administration Bureau to Summon Both Parties Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] There are many cases in this city where rent for houses is paid in foreign currency, gold, or rice, but the Phoenix Silk Company and more than 20 other households are the first to officially submit a written request to the Land Administration Bureau for a ban. The Phoenix Silk Company and more than 20 other households rent houses from Russian Gulin (real estate company at 129 Maoming South Road). Gulin previously demanded that each tenant's rent be increased to US$400. The tenants, unable to afford it, submitted a request to the Land Administration Bureau for a ban. The original request stated: "More than 20 households respectively rent houses on various floors at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Gordon Road. After the currency system was reformed, the landlord Gulin actually demanded that rent be paid at US$400, which is equivalent to eight taels of pure gold or eighty dan of white rice after September of last year. This request violates the standards announced by the municipal government and approved by the municipal council, as well as Article 6 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of House Leasing in this city, which stipulates that rent cannot be calculated in foreign currency. It also does not comply with the provisions of Article 97, Paragraph 1 of the Land Law. At the moment, Gulin is illegally coercing payment of rent in US dollars and threatening eviction. The situation is urgent. We request that you immediately order both parties to be summoned and legally reduce the amount of rent to stabilize society and maintain commerce." The names listed at the end of the document include Phoenix Silk Company, Continental Music House, Best Shoes Company, Bailey Company, Dazhong Bookstore, and more than 20 other households. Shen, the director of the Land Administration Bureau, paid close attention to the submission and has ordered Secretary Qian to summon both parties at 3:00 p.m. today to inquire about the situation and make a decision. According to Secretary Qian, this is also the first case of requesting mediation of housing disputes based on Article 97 of the Land Law.</p>

He insisted on it repeatedly, which angered Chen Shuxian (Shandong native), the accountant of the bar. Chen called in several men, grabbed the sailor, and beat him, resulting in a fractured skull and death. The assailants scattered. Afterwards, the Guangjiawan Police Station ordered officers to investigate and transported the body to Tongren Fuyuantang to report to the Land Prosecutor's Office for an autopsy. After investigation, the investigating police officers believed that Xu Shouting (39 years old), a bar employee, Gao Zhongli (29 years old), and the accountant Chen Shuxian were highly suspected and were arrested and taken to the station for questioning the day before yesterday.</p>

<h3>Tangshan Ship Carrying Coal Arrives in Shanghai: Crew Members Visited Qinhuangdao City; Market is Depressed, Vegetables are Purchased by Exchanging Rice</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The "Guangshan" ship, the second ship transporting coal from Qinhuangdao in exchange for materials from the Communist area, arrived at the Kailuan Coal Line Wharf in Pudong at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. The ship carried 6,800 tons of fuel coal. Together with the fuel coal transported by the previous "Great Shanghai" ship, the total has reached 11,600 tons. According to the ship's captain, Jiang Baokang, the Communist authorities allowed all crew members to go ashore when the ship docked in Qinhuangdao this time. The procedure for going ashore was for him to issue a certificate, which was then verified by customs and Communist political personnel before being released. During their one and a half day stay in Qinhuangdao, although they went to the streets to stroll, they were unable to contact ordinary people. The only impression they had was that the market was depressed. When they went ashore to purchase vegetables, they exchanged them for rice. This method was also stipulated by the Communist political personnel.</p>
<h3>The "Greater Shanghai" Again Sails North Yesterday, Carrying a Large Quantity of Mail and Flour</h3>
<p>In addition, the "Greater Shanghai" transport ship, heading north again, also set sail from Shanghai yesterday. It was loaded with 4,039 packages of mail and 10,000 bags of flour. In the future, there will be ten large ships regularly traveling between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao, undertaking the task of exchanging materials. According to the Coal Regulation Office, the current monthly coal demand in Shanghai is approximately 100,000 tons. In addition to the regular supply of 30,000 to 40,000 tons per month from Keelung, Taiwan, if the shipping industry can also regularly send ten ships from North China, there will be no problem with the coal supply. Furthermore, the current reserves are gradually becoming abundant, and the coal shortage can be alleviated.</p>
<h3>Yang Chuo'an, Accused of Grain Procurement Fraud, Questioned and Released on Bail; Minor Disturbance During Court Adjournment – Chasing a Weasel</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yang Chuo'an, Director of the Emergency Grain Procurement and Storage Committee of the Ministry of Food, and Di Zhaolin, Head of the Industrial Management Group, were impeached by the Control Yuan for grain procurement fraud during their tenure at the Northeast Materials Regulation Committee. The Presidential Office handed the case over to the Supreme Court Procuratorate, which in turn ordered the Shanghai District Procuratorate to investigate. Yesterday, at 8:00 AM, Prosecutor Shen Jiping of the Procuratorate held the initial court hearing. Both defendants arrived on time to answer questions. The case file was large, taking time to review. Finally, the court concluded that the case required further investigation. Both defendants were ordered to provide a substantial store guarantee and were dismissed from the court at 5:30 PM. The prosecutor handling the case refused to disclose the contents of the Control Yuan's impeachment. As the two defendants were leaving the court in the evening, a sharp-snouted weasel, over a foot long, scurried across the drain at the gate of the District Procuratorate. A court police officer spotted it and shouted, "Catch the weasel!" At that moment, court police officers, laborers, and others in the courtyard rushed to capture it. After several attempts, the weasel finally escaped quickly.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Rescued After Attempting Suicide in River After Being Claimed by Her Husband; Reconciliation Between Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A young woman, Zhou Linjun, left home on the 23rd of this month after arguing with her husband, Yang Dingxi. In a moment of grief and anger, she went to Dongjiadu the next morning to attempt suicide in the Huangpu River. Fortunately, she was discovered and rescued by a passerby, who escorted her to the Penglai Police Station. However, after interrogation by the police station, she refused to disclose her name and address. As a last resort, the station transferred her to the Security Section of the General Bureau. Just as they were about to transfer her to a women's shelter, her husband learned of what happened and rushed to the General Bureau to claim her. The couple reunited, bursting into tears. Yang was extremely worried after his wife left home. After searching for several days without any news, he went to the responsible police station yesterday to report and request an investigation. Only then did he learn that five days ago, the Penglai Branch had rescued a woman with similar clothing to his wife who had attempted suicide in the river. He immediately went to the branch, but learned that she had already been transferred to the General Bureau. He then went to the Security Section of the General Bureau, where the department was processing the official documents to transfer his wife to a women's shelter. The department director witnessed the scene and was very moved. After consulting with Director Yu and offering comfort, he approved the release of his wife to her husband. Yang presented a claim slip when claiming his wife, which read, "Yang Dingxi, the undersigned, hereby claims his wife, Zhou Linjun. Presented to the Security Section of the Shanghai Police Bureau." This became a unique item in the claim record.</p>

<h3>A Student Who Came South After the Fall Arrives in Shanghai, Discussing Travel Frustrations; Three Sleepless Nights Without Food Passing Through Dezhou</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The reporter recently encountered a sixth-year student from the Medical College of National Peking University at the train station. He claimed to have come south two weeks after the "liberation" of Peking, experiencing many difficulties along the way, and only arriving in Shanghai last night. Because most of his family members are still residing in Peking, he asked the reporter not to publish his real name to ensure their safety. However, he told the reporter with a resolute and sincere tone that his motivation for leaving Peking was his unwillingness to lose his original freedom, so he risked his life and ventured south. He will graduate this summer. Before Peking fell, he was still interning at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Peking University. He claimed that he has no knowledge of politics and is not interested in it, so he initially remained indifferent amidst the cheers of his classmates celebrating "liberation." Later, a series of naturally occurring events gradually disappointed him, and he developed the idea of going south. On the evening of the 12th of this month, he heard a broadcast from Nanjing on the shortwave radio, which was strictly prohibited by the Chinese Communist Party, knowing that ships had begun to come north from Shanghai. His first step was to plan to find a way to go to Qinhuangdao first. Because the Chinese Communist Party requires people to apply for a "road pass" to leave the customs or go south, he went to the Public Security Bureau and the district office, claiming that he was visiting his sick father in his Shandong hometown, reporting his departure route and the number of luggage items, and applying for the pass. However, they suspected that he was taking a sea route, so they delayed and procrastinated, and after several days of running around, he achieved nothing. He then made another plan to go to Tianjin to find a way, but he felt that the Chinese Communist Party's administrative control methods were not uniform, and it became even more difficult after arriving in Tianjin. He had no choice but to return to the ancient city. That night, he confided in a professor at Peking University, asking him why he, as an old Kuomintang member, did not consider leaving Peking. The professor pondered for a long time, repeatedly stating that he had to stay to protect the school.</p>
<p>Took a Train to Dezhou from Peking Based on the Pass</p>
<p>At this time, he had another friend who also planned to return south with him at the same time, so he once again tried to arrange a "road pass". On the 20th, he met a female duty officer in the Public Security Sub-bureau, and after inquiring about the situation, she said, "You are a doctor and have served the people, so you can be allowed to leave." But she pointed to his friend and said, "You are a graduate of the Central Military Academy and cannot leave for the time being." At this point, he decided to take the "road pass" to leave Peking alone. However, after arriving in Dezhou, he found that his friend had followed him. Before they could talk in detail, they hurriedly negotiated "changing trains". Dezhou is now a transit station for the two administrative regions of the Chinese Communist Party. Precisely because of this, after strict inspections, they were deemed to have insufficient documents and were not allowed to board the train. Because he was eager to go south, he handed over his luggage to his friend that night and bid him farewell, saying, "I have decided to find a way to sneak into the station. If anything happens, take care of yourself."</p>
<p>Workers in the Station Helped; Hidden in Coal Cars to Exit</p>
<p>At that time, there was a worker in the station whose family had been treated by him at the Third Hospital of Peking University. After unintentionally meeting him, he learned of the situation and promised to act as an escort to repay his kindness. After 8:00 PM, several coal cars were driven out of the siding for loading. The worker hid him in a coal car, and as a result, he was able to leave the country. After that, he tried to find a way along the way, changing routes several times, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday after three sleepless nights. According to him, the university is brewing reforms, and the length of study may be shortened, and the faculties of arts and law will be merged. Each teacher in the universities receives a monthly salary of 1,500 people's tickets, plus 60 pounds of millet and a bag of flour. Each staff member receives a monthly salary of 1,000 people's tickets, plus 60 pounds of miscellaneous grains. Each worker receives a monthly salary of 750 people's tickets. The income is not much different from before, and the status of workers has not been raised as rumored. The Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to cultural and educational undertakings. The Peking Military Control Commission has a "Cultural and Education Group" to lead all cultural and educational activities. Several grand celebrations of "liberation" in the ancient city were all "led" by the group. All newspapers in Peking use Xinhua News Agency reports. Land policy, urban work policy, and new democracy have become the center of revising the original curriculum of the schools. Almost all of the deans of students in the universities have been replaced.</p>

<h3>Are You Lin Biao's Troops? …New Observations from Beiping After Local Peace…</h3>
<p>— Andrew Roth</p>
<p>[Beiping Dispatch] When this reporter boarded the last plane to the Beiping line before the Communists took over, an old friend said to me, "You've come at just the right time, you can write another 'Ten Days That Shook the World'!"  'Ten Days That Shook the World' is a magnificent book by John Reed depicting the Bolsheviks seizing power in November 1917.</p>
<p>For months, the Communist Party has been winning victories in China. It not only has the potential to shake the world, but also to change the balance of the world, encouraging Stalin to launch a peace offensive in order to win equal peace.</p>
<p>It wasn't until January 31st that the Communist army entered Beiping, without any prior notice or preparations.</p>
<p>Marching All Day</p>
<p>On February 3rd, troops marched on the main roads of the city all day long, reportedly departing from the Pingjin area to the southern battlefields. In the Communist army ranks passing through Beiping city, there were hundreds of newly captured American trucks, dragging many Japanese-style artillery pieces and six-inch mountain guns. Of course, the Red Army also had Soviet trucks, but they did not participate in this marching procession.</p>
<p>What was most touching about this march was not the material aspects, but the people. The clothing of the Communist soldiers, apart from wearing leather hats, was also light yellow military uniforms, almost no different from the Nationalists, and both were conscripted peasants. The Nationalist soldiers made you feel so..., but the Communist soldiers looked so energetic. This is naturally the result of their usual ideological training under the name of the "People's Liberation Army." At the time, two students asked several Communist soldiers, "Are you Lin Biao's troops?" They replied, "No, we are the people's army." From the above incident, we can also discover the Communist army's sense of self-esteem.</p>
<p>Automatic and Passive</p>
<p>The people of Beiping, some voluntarily, some passively, came out to welcome the Communist army entering the city. The only group that seemed to be enthusiastic were the students. In the streets, you could often see students dressed up, singing, and performing Yangge dances. Although all of this is a manifestation of young people's enthusiasm, the Beiping student movement has always represented a part of national consciousness. In the nationalist movements of 1919 and 1925, and the anti-Japanese movement of 1936, the Beiping student movement had a real presence.</p>
<p>Other residents of Beiping were less enthusiastic about the march. Beiping is China's most famous ancient cultural city, and the Chinese people who have gone through long-term suffering have become suspicious and nosy. They believe that the government is a permanent evil. Their attitude towards the government does not depend on what the government is called or what plans it has, but on whether that government can let them live.</p>
<p>A liberal foreigner returned home and excitedly said to his cook, "The Communist Party has come!" But the cook calmly replied, "Prices are still so high."</p>
<p>Prices in Beiping are falling, because Beiping is now connected to the interior, the supply of water and electricity has improved, and trams have also resumed operation. The 8 o'clock curfew has been lifted. Many people in Beiping have been touched by the Communist army's exemplary actions.</p>
<p>The takeover work is proceeding smoothly. The Kuomintang's North China Daily has now been renamed the People's Daily, run by the Communist Party. This newspaper is edited by a famous Chinese journalist. Many newspapers in Beiping, except for one, have replaced the previous Kuomintang Central News Agency news with the Communist Party's Xinhua News Agency news.</p>
<p>Lack of Talent</p>
<p>An easily unnoticed fact is the lack of talent (which is due to the Communist Party's military victory exceeding its political ability). Therefore, whenever they take over an institution, they only take over the duties of the superiors, and the remaining lower-level personnel are not changed. For example, the Beiping Police Bureau, apart from replacing six Kuomintang officials with Communist Party members, has not changed otherwise. The current Director of the Beiping Police Bureau is General Tan Zhen, wearing a cotton uniform that is too wide and large, and with his sleeves rolled up.</p>
<p>"We have very little experience in managing a city," the director reported to his subordinates. "All we know is how to govern a village. We will learn from you, but you must also learn from us." The first thing he told the police was: The poor people have now stood up.</p>
<p>The Communist Party seems to be very enthusiastic about supporting the poor. The first major event the Communist Party did after taking over Beiping was the Labor Congress on February 7th. On the congress stage, there were Communist Party flags and portraits of Mao Zedong and Zhu De. More than 20,000 workers came from inside and outside the city that day, including the worker delegation from the Mentougou coal mine. The gray-faced laborers were honorably embraced and sat on the stage, and the speakers began to tell them that they now had a "People's Government," and they must work hard and oppose the offensive of the "American-peddled peace brokers."</p>
<p>Printing Money</p>
<p>The Communist Party has been completely successful in encouraging workers to repair railways and do other work through various means. This is because its hard work and leadership have set a good example, and not just relying on propaganda. In the first few days of the Communist army entering Beiping, the Communist Party's currency system administrator had a 20-minute conversation with the person in charge of the former government's Beiping branch of the Central Printing Factory. The result of this conversation was to stop the printing of the rapidly devaluing Gold Yuan Certificates and instead print "People's Currency." It is said that the Communist Party officials participating in the "People's Currency" printing work worked day and night, sleeping only a few hours each day on the floor next to his desk.</p>
<p>Self-Reflection</p>
<p>Within the Chinese Communist Party, discipline is very strict. General Ye Jianying, the current Mayor of Beiping, also only wears a worn-out blue cloth cotton uniform without medals. All daily necessities of the Communist soldiers are completely supplied by the military, and they are not allowed to buy anything themselves. When someone asked the Communist Party's political workers how they spend their evenings, the answer was a very stern few words: "Self-reflection."</p>
<p>The Communist Party members all have a secure vigilance, that is, unless permitted by the military, it is forbidden to take any photos except for those they publish. It is not easy for anyone to get photos of their army. The Nanjing peace delegation was allowed to fly to Beiping, but when the plane circled over Beiping, it was immediately attacked by the Communist army's anti-aircraft artillery. Chinese journalists who came with the peace delegation were also prevented from leaving the airport by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>However, excessive strictness almost completely isolated the city's aviation from the Kuomintang-controlled areas. This is because the Communist Party is afraid that airplanes will become tools for military and political espionage. The same fear is the fear that secret radio and telegraph communication with Tianjin and other Communist Party-occupied areas will be broken. In Beiping, if necessary, it is still possible to make wireless calls to friends in Shanghai and Nanjing.</p>
<p>The only difficult problem now facing the new government in Beiping is dealing with foreigners and foreign relations. There are about 2,000 foreigners in Beiping, including many foreign envoys, because Beiping was once the capital of China.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese Communist Party now rules over 400 million people, it has not been officially recognized by any foreign country. Therefore, their feelings towards foreigners are not very good. Like in Tianjin, some foreign envoys, including the Soviet envoy, wanted to visit the newly appointed mayor of Tianjin, but were rejected. The answer received was: "Because you do not recognize us, we are also not very willing to recognize you." This point is the Communist Party's lack of diplomatic experience, because in international law, diplomatic recognition is irrelevant to the status of envoys.</p>
<p>Communist Party members are also suspicious of foreigners who have lived in the interior for a long time, because they believe that in today's world, the anti-Communist world is actively opposing them, and the Communist world is only passively approving of them. Foreigners are not prevented from traveling between Beiping and other Communist areas, and they can obtain a travel permit to travel. But in Beiping, no travel permits have been issued to foreigners yet. It is conceivable that there is a shortage of necessary machinery in the Communist areas. The main reason for the shortage is the unwillingness of foreign ships to come to Tianjin and trade with the Communist areas. Similarly, it is very difficult for foreign journalists to obtain official information, because low-level Communist Party officials are also unwilling to talk to foreign journalists.</p>
<p>Closure and Confiscation</p>
<p>Among many foreign countries, the Communist Party hates the United States the most, just like the nationalists. They resent the United States for helping the "reactionary regime" to interfere in China's internal affairs. They believe that the United States is the driving force behind anti-communism. They regard American consuls as enemy members within Chinese territory. They regard American journalists as highly likely spies. According to reports, the radio station of the American consulate in Shenyang has not only been closed like the radio stations of other countries' consulates, but has been further confiscated.</p>
<p>At the same time, Communist Party members feel difficult, because if China wants to modernize quickly in the future, the only source of industrial materials is the United States.</p>
<p>The recent Communist Party's takeover of American flour in Tianjin is also a new thing. Although the original intention of American economic aid to China was to strengthen China's anti-communist forces, on the surface it was to aid the Chinese people with food and medicine. The result of the post-war American aid being distributed by the Kuomintang was that it all went into the pockets of officials. Therefore, the American side replaced it with its own distribution. The Communist Party and other parties believe that this matter is an undeniable interference in China's internal affairs. When the Communist Party captured Tianjin, they took over 5,000 tons of American flour and distributed it without the consent of American officials. Washington's response to this matter was only to abolish the economic aid agencies in Tianjin and Beiping.</p>
<p>Recently, the anti-"American Imperialism" sentiment has been very intense, and two American journalists have been dubbed "American Imperialist Journalists." A Communist soldier once said to an American professor: "We know America. Some of the people there want to kill us. Some of the people want to help us. But most Americans know very little about China and pay no attention to it." What is most noteworthy is that Truman Road in Tianjin has been renamed, but Roosevelt Road has not been changed.</p>

<p>Commanders of the "People's Army" on the Henan-Hubei Front: (Above) Commander Zhang Gan (Below) Deputy Commander Wang Jingsong (Reported by our special correspondent Fang Canglang)</p>
<h3>The Smiling Tiger Understands the People's Suffering - Encouragement Replaces the Whip</h3>
<p>— Our special correspondent Fang Canglang</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Xinyang, This Newspaper, 21st] This reporter was determined to interview Commander Zhang Gan, Deputy Commander Wang Jingsong, and Chief of Staff Huo Guannan. When the car arrived at a certain place, General Zhang Gan, who was 56 years old, was already waiting in front of the door, with a face full of smiles, showing all his charms, greeting and shaking hands with each of our colleagues. His inherent light and heat, in the eight years of the War of Resistance and the recent three years, had illuminated every peak of the Dabie Mountains, and every inch of land in the border area of ​​the four provinces of southern Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Hubei, warming the hearts of thousands of soldiers and civilians. He has light, heat, and confidence, so he can always stand and smile in this extremely dangerous era - a living, foolish "smiling tiger."</p>
<p>After the greetings were over, the reception proceeded according to the scheduled program, unfolding scene by scene. First, we listened quietly to General Zhang's views on the current situation. He said, "It's best to make peace. If the other party is unwilling to negotiate peace with sincerity, and even gradually approaches and attacks, then we are ready to accept orders and respond to the battle in accordance with the will of the people." Speaking of this, the reporter asked him: What if the other party attacks now? He suddenly laughed up to the sky and replied: "At this time, we express our welcome. It's okay to slow down a little, because when the other party adds a bit of strength, we will double our enrichment and double our strength. However, for the sake of the people's lives and property, peace is better!" From this conversation, we discovered that their fighting will is beyond rationality, and their fighting strength is built on the basis of the people's conscience. The people of Henan and Hubei provinces have unanimously given the Zhang Gan Corps a new title of "People's Army" to replace the whip with encouragement, and the Zhang Gan Corps really deserves it.</p>
<p>Folk Music Raises the Dragon Dance and Beats the Taiping Drum</p>
<p>The second item of the reception was to listen to the situation, look at the charts. Speaking of the situation, what can be reported has probably already been seen in the special dispatch of this newspaper. What needs to be supplemented is that the Communist army is exerting its strength in the northeast of Zhumadian to deal with the two divisions of the National Army, Liao and Yu, and other troops, about 30,000 in number, who were forced to surrender in Xuzhou and transferred to southern Henan, but have not yet disarmed. One part has already surrendered their guns and left Shao, and another part is discussing credit issues with the Communist army. On the west side of the railway, the 30,000 Communist troops on the line from Wuyang to Tanghe are constantly reorganizing and successively heading to Xiangfan and Shayang. The Communist army's attempt to control both sides of the Yangtze River with superior forces and firepower in the shallow and difficult terrain of Shayang, forcibly cross the Yangtze River, and try to enter Sichuan in the west and spy on Jiangxi and Gan in the east is worth noting, but there is no need to be alarmed, because their chips are not yet sufficient, and the National Army's fishing nets have been spread to both sides of the river with red arrows, waiting for an opportunity to catch them. In addition, from a chart that we were allowed to see by the Zhang Corps, we can see that they have achieved a B-level effect in deploying intelligence networks and anti-espionage networks. This is the first factor in victory. Compared with those who have put in A-level efforts for this but only get D-level results, there is really no comparison.</p>
<p>The third item of the reception was of course indispensable eating, drinking and entertainment. Fortunately, our "press corps" only got Chief of Staff Huo so excited that one of them got drunk, but they didn't bother their ancestors' soldiers, and still took the car back to the train to sleep. Before falling asleep, I remembered that at the evening party in the corps headquarters, I had seen their officers and soldiers and cooks, like a group of happy children, crowding behind and on both sides of General Zhang, clapping their hands without any scruples, shouting, and laughing. They are really a happy big family sharing weal and woe.</p>
<p>The next day was the Yuan Festival and the Folk Music Festival. Our group of small "press corps," who rarely go to the countryside, after visiting the local people's representatives and the Wuhan Newspaper Association's representatives who gave General Zhang Gan two banners with the words "Deterring the Central Plains" and "Barrier of the Yangtze and Han Rivers," saw the people from the four townships dancing the dragon lantern. The scene was crowded with people, the dragon lanterns were colorful, and there were more than 100 of them. In the deafening sound of drums and firecrackers, this was indeed a rare sight. At this time, General Zhang Gan shook his whole body again, filled his face with a smile, and stuffed a Victory brand cigarette into the mouth of each dragon to reward the dragon and the farmers who danced the dragon with a piece of kindness. Even after the dragon flew away and the people dispersed, the laughter still lingered in my ears.</p>
<p>Peaceful Greetings to the Rooster's Long Cries in Xinyang</p>
<p>The Hengdian interviewing work came to an end. The news special car we were riding in decided to be attached to the express train departing from northern Hubei on the 13th, heading straight to Xinyang. Before the departure, we asked the military to remove the telephone installed in the sleeping car room and bid farewell to the representatives of all walks of life in the local area, and continued to move north.</p>
<p>The train departed north from Hengdian, passing through Xiaogan, Huayuan, Guangshui, and Wushengguan in northern Hubei, to reach Jigong Mountain, the dividing line between Henan and Hubei provinces, at 4 pm. Jigong Mountain is the only summer resort in central China, with a station located at the foot of the mountain. Unfortunately, due to the incessant war in the past 11 years, the trees on the mountain have been decreasing day by day, and many houses are also dilapidated. Looking out of the window, only white snow is seen, and the sky is vast and desolate, which makes people feel that the mountains and rivers are not as good as before. On the day before the Spring Festival, when Xinyang took emergency evacuation measures, an interesting episode actually occurred here after Queshan, Huangchuan, and Xinyang. Fang Xiangli, the director of the mountain administration, was kidnapped by a Lishan county head who was both a bandit and an official, and more than 30 rifles were confiscated. When the news spread, all the grass and trees on Jigong Mountain were soldiers. In fact, the large Communist army did not go south. Before long, the Zhang Corps went north, and the confused county head took advantage of the situation and sent the director and weapons back to their original places. Then it was said that there was nothing wrong. However, the local tyrants in Queshan did invite local Communists pretending to be Liu's army, but they also retreated. The so-called Eight People's Security Committee of Xinyang also ended hastily after the arrival of the large army. The most miserable thing is that the enthusiastic gentlemen representatives of Huangchuan who advocated peace have not been released after being detained by the Communist army. The storm of the end of the century has blown down the confused bugs who lack stability, which is also a tragedy of the times.</p>
<p>The car stopped for a moment and moved slowly. At about 5 pm, it arrived in Xinyang. When the special car entered the station, the young "press corps" members who were traveling together saw that Xinyang was indeed safe and sound after their separation, and their singing and whistling rose together. After we got off the bus and thanked Secretary-General Luo of the Provincial Government, Wang Dingjiu and Zhang Liao of the Fifth Sui District Command, and the representatives of the Zhang Corps's army headquarters one by one, we immediately organized ourselves to take a car into the city. Because the car we were riding in was a military vehicle, there was no need to present identity cards or receive bamboo slips and other procedures. In less than ten minutes, we arrived at the Sui District Guest House in the city. After dinner, Commander Zhang Zhen held a tea party to entertain the reporters and reported in detail on the military and political situation in southern Henan.</p>
<p>Zhang Yisan is Kind, Li Bengong is Amazingly Strong</p>
<p>Wuhan is adjacent to southern Henan, and the reporters have a considerable understanding of the past distribution of the National Army's troops in southern Henan, the posture of the Communist army in front of them, the "high opinions" of the veterans who participated in the meeting in Xinyang on the issue of peace and war, and the difficult situation of that prominent, long candle-shaped tip of the Pinghan Line from Zhumadian to Xinyang. Therefore, at the tea party, there were few questions about the past situation in Xinyang, and there was no mention of a certain army that ran from Xinyang to the Yellow Crane Tower before the Spring Festival, because that unit should have gone to the rear for reinforcements long ago. However, General Zhang Zhen, who was honest, honest, and clumsy in diplomatic rhetoric, did not blame others for the responsibility of the hasty evacuation. He only lightly said a few words about the pain, stuffiness, and even internal and external injuries he suffered since the withdrawal from Kaifeng. Finally, he said in a tone close to grief and indignation: "We have 100% sincerity and confidence in 'peace,' but we almost suffered a big loss and can't lose heart anymore."</p>
<p>After the reception, our group went to the army headquarters of the Zhang Gan Corps's army to visit Army Commander Li Benyi (nicknamed Yaoge). This general is no stranger in the memories of the people in the southeast. After "August 13," in the Battle of Yuncaobang, he led a regiment of troops to severely damage the enemy and calmly covered the retreat of tens of thousands of troops in Hangzhou. This battle made him famous and restored the reputation of the "Steel Army," laying the foundation for his position today. He is 44 years old this year and is originally from Guilin. In his 20 years of military life, he has been a soldier, received higher military education, walked over thousands of mountains, and fought more than 150 tough battles, but he has never suffered a big loss. His fighting spirit can be called a piece of tempered steel in this large corps. However, when he applies it to political awareness and displays it in front of the vast public, he can immediately turn into a gentle force, so that everyone who approaches him can quickly understand his wit, resilience, and fire-like enthusiasm, which is an essential element for solving any difficult problem.</p>
<p>The Arrow Can Be Placed Anywhere at Any Time</p>
<p>That evening, when he met with us twice, he reported many situations very faithfully. He estimated that there were about seven columns of the Communist army in front of southern Henan, and the northeast was being digested. Some bones and hairs were being escorted from the Xuzhou-Bengbu area, and the Communist army was hovering southwest of the railway waiting for an opportunity. No matter where the other party's arrow is inserted, their brothers can deploy at any time to meet them, because they regard protecting the territory and ensuring the safety of the people as their duty, and strong confidence is what they should have.</p>
<p>That night at midnight, after exploring the situation of the offensive and defensive battle in Zhengyang County, north and east of Zhumadian, we listened to what Army Commander Li said: When Li's army went north, passing through Dongshuanghe and other places, because the soldiers would rather get wet in the rain and freeze under the eaves than live in civilian houses, and would not arbitrarily move firewood outside civilian houses, they moved the local residents, who asked the soldiers to bake by the fire and eat salted meat rice cakes. Some touching stories made us forget our fatigue. Strict military discipline is the key to the success of the Zhang Corps, so when they arrive in a place, the hearts of the people are settled down, and the other party, when they hear that Zhang Gan's troops are coming, although they are not as fearful as Cao Cao's troops when they encounter Zhang Fei and flee immediately, they have been extra cautious for a long time. No wonder foreign news agencies have repeatedly mistakenly reported that the Zhang Gan Corps has been transferred east, which shows that this news is very important. The Wuhan reporters stayed in Xinyang for two days, in addition to visiting military and political circles and participating in the symposiums of the provincial government and the Sui district, they also went deep into the folk to visit in groups. The opinions collected from the general public have been provided to all parties for reference and improvement, and they are particularly concerned about improving the treatment of soldiers. With everything settled, our group took the special express train on the Pinghan Line to Zhumadian at 8:30 am on the 15th to visit the soldiers and civilians on the front line.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Major Robbery in Guashang, Changzhou</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Wujin, This Newspaper, 26th] Chenjia Village, Banshang, Dongxiang, Changzhou, has only fifteen or sixteen households, most of whom make a living by farming, making bricks and tiles, and making gluten. They work hard all year round, barely able to keep warm and full. On the 24th of this month, suddenly 50 or 60 bandits arrived, each holding flashlights, long and short guns, and two machine guns. They claimed to be the "New Fourth Army," some in yellow uniforms and some in plain clothes. First, they forced the head of the village to knock on the doors of each household, ordering all the men, women, old and young, more than 50 people in the entire village, to concentrate in the Land Temple in the west of the village, claiming to hold a meeting. The bandits then arbitrarily washed and looted each household, and fired several warning shots, lasting three or four hours. Then they carried stolen goods and fled northward on a large ship that had been prepared in advance. After the incident, each household checked and found that they had lost more than 100 shi of white rice, as well as countless clothes, chickens, and other livestock. On the 26th, the case was reported to the county government.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Lieutenant Platoon Leader Accused of Acting as a Private</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Zhenjiang, This Newspaper, 26th] Lieutenant Platoon Leader Wu Gongnuo of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army took a car to Gaozi. When he arrived at Shibaidu, he was taken to the team headquarters by a soldier of a certain unit and used as a private. Wu escaped that night, but his symbols, fake certificate, a gold ring, and 200 yuan in gold were all "confiscated." He is now reporting to the division headquarters and asking the Ministry of National Defense to investigate.</p>
<h3>Outside Stories from the Capital's Press Circles</h3>
<p>Sealing and Acknowledgement [Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] After the Nanjing People's Daily "died," there has been no sign of resurrection. Two editors of the newspaper, who were previously detained by the Capital Garrison Headquarters, have now been released on bail after claiming "youthful ignorance." The only condition is that they must publish an acknowledgement in the newspaper after their release. On the 25th, the Central Daily News here published an acknowledgement from the two editors, the words of which are filled with untold bitterness. The acknowledgement is transcribed below: "Acknowledgement from Zai Shou-shan and Li Ji, editors of the Nanjing People's Daily: It is hereby announced that the news item published in this newspaper on February 1st concerning Chief Huang of the Capital Police Department was entirely without factual basis. A reporter of this newspaper casually released news, reversing right and wrong, disrupting public perception, and deliberately slandering the head of public security. According to the law, we should be punished. Zai Shou-shan and Li Ji, as editors, failed to carefully examine the content and were exploited by others, causing this error. We deeply regret and are extremely ashamed! Besides awaiting legal action, there is no room to plead for leniency. However, Chief Huang is benevolent and compassionate, not only unwilling to pursue the matter but also kindly pleaded with the Garrison Headquarters to impose a lighter sentence and grant bail. We are deeply grateful and hereby issue this acknowledgement!"</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the Nanjing People's Daily was sealed, the New China Daily News here published an editorial protesting the injustice of the People's Daily and submitted a protest to the Garrison Headquarters. After the editorial was published, the newspaper was punished that very day with a one-month suspension. (Ai )</p>
<p>Playing a Drama? Or a Drill? [Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] The Daily Evening News here published a news item on the 17th entitled "Storm Clouds Gathering Over Both Banks of the Yangtze, Fierce Fighting at Wujiang Last Night." The Garrison Headquarters was greatly angered, resulting in the newspaper being forced to publish a correction notice in all the newspapers in the capital.</p>
<p>The evening edition of a certain major newspaper called Luo Chunbo, the director of the political work department of the Garrison Headquarters, to inquire about the actual situation on both sides of the Yangtze. Luo said on the phone, "I solemnly inform you that both sides of the Yangtze are extremely peaceful. The soldiers at the front are there playing a drama." The next day, the newspaper prominently published the news "Soldiers on Both Sides of the Yangtze Held Military Exercises Yesterday." Luo was greatly shocked upon seeing this. After inquiring, he learned that "playing a drama" had been misheard as "military exercises." As a result, another correction was issued.</p>
<p>Interestingly, after the newspaper published this erroneous news item, the China Times here reprinted it in the same way, changing the source to "Our Newspaper Reports." This can't help but be seen as a joke. (Ai Xiong)</p>
<p>Due to Delayed Delivery of Materials for the Large Bridge in Zhangshu, Only the Design for a Temporary Bridge Suitable for Low Water Levels Before March Has Been Delivered So Far. Steel Beams Are Urgently Needed Before the High Water Level Rises to Complete the Bridge. (Report from Our Reporter, Zao)</p>
<h3>Zhangshu Bridge Project: Steel Beams Still Need to Be Resolved</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Nanchang, 21st Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The reconstruction project of the Zhangshu Bridge on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the bridge over the Gan River tributary was delayed last winter due to the failure of the Canadian steel beams to arrive on schedule. Only 50% of the concrete pier base project for the two bridges and the riverbed dredging project were completed by September of the 37th year. Since the opening of the Nanchang-Zhuzhou section of the railway, transportation has been busy. Therefore, a temporary bridge, a challenging project, was completed on December 1st of last year to connect the 1,300-kilometer through-train route. However, the temporary bridge was initially built with the expectation of only being used during the low water season before this year's spring floods due to a shortage of timber, the excessive width of the river, and other difficulties. According to Huang Shou-yi, the director of the bridge construction office, and Zou Yue-sheng, the director of the Nanchang-Zhuzhou section engineering office, who recently came to the province from Zhangshu, the water level of the Gan River has gradually risen. This year's highest water level has reached 55.7 meters, only 2.2 meters below the standard high water level of 58 meters from the bridge surface. Although the railway bureau once planned to raise the bridge surface, a decision has not been made due to material constraints and safety concerns regarding train operation after raising the bridge height. If the water level of the Gan River rises further, it may be necessary to resume using ferries and connecting transportation on both the east and west banks when western trains arrive at Zhangshu Station in order to maintain operations. It is reported that six spans of the main bridge steel beams have arrived in Shanghai, and another three spans were on a foreign vessel that caught fire off the coast of Taipei on the 10th of this month and must be transferred to Kowloon for unloading. The existing steel beams only account for 10% of the materials required for the bridge site. Therefore, when the U.S. aid investigation team arrived in Zhangshu, they paid special attention to the bridge project and unanimously agreed to urgently find solutions to fulfill the important mission of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in the future.</p>
<h3>"Okay! Okay!" A Record of the President of Jinhua Yingshi University Being Attacked</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhen</p>
<p>[Jinhua, 21st Dispatch] Tang Jihe, the president of Yingshi University, rushed back to Jinhua from Nanjing. When school started, he was naturally very busy. At 12 o'clock on February 15th, as usual, he took a rickshaw from the school to go home. When the rickshaw approached the slope near Tongsheng Lane, a young man of about twenty years old, wearing a black uniform, overcoat, parted hair, and pointed leather shoes, suddenly emerged from another lane. He struck the president on the back of his head with a thick wooden stick. One blow was not enough, and he followed up with three or four more blows. Clearly, this young man was prepared to kill him. At that time, President Tang's head was bleeding profusely, and he fell unconscious. When the soldiers who were pulling the rickshaw wanted to catch the assailant, the young man had already fled through the streets and alleys. The next day, the Jinhua Minbao wrote: "The news of President Tang being attacked shocked the entire mountain city. That a giant in the local education community would be ambushed is a significant event. The reasons for the attack are subject to various speculations. However, it is said that when President Tang was attacked, he did not cry for help and instead said, 'Okay! Okay!' Could it be that he possessed the spirit of Jesus?" As for why a university president would be ambushed, some say that it was done by the thirty-nine students who were expelled last semester. Others say that it was the work of students from various places who wanted to audit classes at Yingshi University but were angered by the president's refusal to admit them. Still others say that it was instigated by several professors who were previously dismissed by President Tang. There are even those who say that it is related to the students of Jinhua Middle School (referring to the conflict between some students of Yingshi University and Jinhua Middle School over watching a play on the night of May 28th last year)... As for the exact reason, I think only President Tang, who is still in the hospital, can answer.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Yangzhou Overseas Students Association</h3>
<p>To the Yangzhou overseas students who contacted through the newspaper's social services column: We have received all your letters and are now replying as follows: (1) We hope everyone will unite to jointly solve all the difficulties we face abroad. (2) More than 80% of the students are staying with relatives and friends along the Jinghu Railway line and are unemployed. The problem of food and shelter is gradually becoming difficult. We appeal to the community to extend a helping hand to rescue this large group of students. (3) The Ministry of Education originally had a temporary school in Suzhou, but when you wrote, the Ministry of Education had moved to Guangzhou, and the school had stopped recruiting due to a lack of public funds. It is said that it will be restored soon. In addition to finding out more information, we hope that everyone will listen for good news and prepare their documents and luggage. (4) Regarding the employment issue, we intend to introduce talents to various counties. We hope that students will introduce themselves to jobs that interest them. (5) The order in our hometown is as before, and the schools have resumed classes. In the future, we plan to report hometown news at any time. (6) The news of the selected schools in Yangzhou is temporarily impossible to count. There are rumors that schools such as Jiangsu Yangzhou Middle School, Jiangsu Taizhou Middle School, and Jiangsu Yancheng Middle School have established a temporary school in Qianyuan Temple, Qizishan, Suzhou. If it is confirmed, we plan to apply on behalf of the students from private schools, especially those who want to return to school to study. (7) To the third-year students, we hope that the authorities will find a solution as soon as possible, or set up a temporary school to complete the only half-semester of study left. (8) We hope that all students will keep in touch at all times. Correspondence address: No. 17, Dan yang Da nan men jie. Yangzhou Overseas Students Association.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Circular Cancels Restrictions: Foreign Exchange Certificates Can Be Freely Traded; Detailed Rules for the New Plan Will Be Announced Successively</h3>
<p>The Central Bank previously issued Circular No. 170 to prevent speculation, which restricted the trading of foreign exchange certificates, meaning that only importers and exporters could trade them. After the announcement of the financial and economic plan, this circular should be cancelled. The bank issued a circular on the 28th, informing the designated banks that, from now on, foreign exchange certificates can be freely traded.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange transfer certificates yesterday (28th) initially rose but then softened in the market. They opened at 2,750 yuan in the morning, and market sentiment was quite strong, rising to 2,800 yuan. At that time, the Central Bank sold off at high prices, and the price was eventually pushed back down, closing at 2,660 yuan in the afternoon, but still slightly up 10 yuan from the previous weekend.</p>
<p>President Liu of the Central Bank returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 27th. He separately invited financial leaders to exchange views on the implementation of the financial and economic reform plan and convened heads of various departments of the Central Bank to discuss relevant implementation issues. According to the spokesperson of the Central Bank:</p>
<p>(1) Detailed rules for the implementation of the financial and economic reform plan will be announced successively. Those related to the Central Bank are already being handled.</p>
<p>(2) The gold yuan will continue to be issued, but it will be compressed as much as possible. The spirit of the entire financial and economic plan is to compress the issuance of gold yuan.</p>
<p>(3) President Liu invited financial leaders and experts to a meeting on the evening of the 27th to exchange views on the implementation of the financial and economic plan.</p>
<p>(4) The open market for gold and silver is being discussed.</p>
<p>(5) There are countermeasures to curb rising prices. In addition to selling materials, gold, silver certificates, foreign exchange certificates, and others can be sold at any time.</p>
<p>(6) Gold and silver deposits have not yet been decided.</p>
<p>(7) The purchase price of foreign currency will be posted from the first day.</p>
<p>(8) The gold yuan is the only standard currency. All sales contracts and accounting should be based on the gold yuan. The law will never allow silver dollars to be used as the unit of measure.</p>
<h3>The Central Bank Approves Relaxed Foreign Exchange Settlement for Price Discounts and Commission Payments</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to information from the Export Management Committee: After export goods are exported, their quality may be reduced due to force majeure, causing foreign buyers to request price discounts upon receiving the goods. Such price discounts can often reach 5/1000 of annual exports for reputable exporters. In addition, exported goods are often trivial and difficult to handle, or the sales areas are remote, so foreign agents take the opportunity to demand higher commissions. The allocation of these two types of foreign exchange was originally deducted from the export foreign exchange that exporters sold to the Central Bank under the current exchange settlement situation. However, in order to prevent the waste of foreign exchange funds, the Central Bank had strict approval standards for the allocation of these two types of foreign exchange in the past. Exporters often found themselves in difficulty as a result. In order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, the Export Management Committee had repeatedly discussed this issue with the Central Bank, requesting a relaxation. The Central Bank has now agreed that if Chinese exporters experience requests for price discounts from buyers after the export of their goods, they can provide accurate and reasonable documents, such as public notary office weighing lists and laboratory reports. The Central Bank may consider the actual situation and approve the settlement. As for applications for commissions from foreign agents, if the commission rate for the exported goods is within the range of export commission rates set by the Central Bank, it will be handled according to regulations. If the commission rate for the exported goods has not yet been determined, it can be handled with reference to the accurate supporting documents provided by the exporter, but the amount should not exceed 5% of the total F.O.B. value of the exported goods.</p>
<h3>Money Tightens in the Afternoon as State Banks Deposit Funds</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the money market in the city was initially loose, with the daily interest rate at 35-40 yuan per thousand yuan in the morning. Due to tightened money in the afternoon, it rose to over 50 yuan, with the highest reaching 60 yuan. Yesterday, due to heavy expenditures for military and government expenses, a large amount of funds flowed out of state banks, but the Bank of Communications sold a large amount of foreign exchange settlement certificates, resulting in a net deposit of over 800 million, which tightened the money market. Yesterday, the net deposit of state banks was 548.92 million, the net deposit of foreign banks was 833.8 million, the net deposit of the large clearing house was 653.9 million, and the net outflow of the small clearing house was 1286.2 million.</p>
<h3>Interest Rates for Deposits and Loans in the Silver and Money Industry Will Be Increased Separately Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Interest rates for deposits and loans in the silver and money industry will be increased starting today. The deposit interest rate will be adjusted from 7.5 yuan per thousand yuan per day to 10 yuan per thousand yuan per day, which is equivalent to 9 jiao per month; the loan interest rate will be adjusted from 30 yuan per thousand yuan per day to 40 yuan per thousand yuan per day, which is equivalent to 1.2 yuan per month. The interbank daily interest rate will also be increased from 24 yuan per thousand yuan to 32 yuan, which is equivalent to 9.6 jiao per month. In addition, the monthly interest rates for deposits and loans in the silver and money industry for this month are 225 yuan per thousand yuan for deposits, which is equivalent to 2 jiao and 5.5 fen per month, and 1,800 yuan per thousand yuan for loans, which is equivalent to 1.8 yuan per month.</p>
<h3>Sharp Opening, Sluggish Close for Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday's stock market opened with favorable conditions, boosting morale among both industry insiders and outsiders, who actively pursued aggressive buying, leading to strong gains. Around 10:30 AM, many stocks reached their daily limits. However, some traders opted to sell at higher prices, while new buyers remained cautious, leading to a dissipation of momentum. The release of an increased cost of living index further prompted profit-taking, with the Wing On Textile Company (永紗) showing early signs of sluggishness, followed by other stocks softening as well. Closing prices were generally at the lower end of the day's range, resulting in overall gains ranging from one cent to 10.03 yuan compared to last Saturday. Taiwan Sugar (台糖) rose 1950 yuan, closing at the upper limit. Chun Hsing Paint (振漆) and Wing Yip Enterprises (永業) had buy orders at the upper limit. Other stocks that reached the upper limit included China Flour Mill (華豐), New Asia Hotel (新亞), Shanghai Cement (上泥), Wing Fung Textile (榮豐), Chin Hsing Spinning (勤興), Mei Ah Tobacco (美亞), Commercial Press (商務), and China Match (火柴), totaling eight. Wing On Textile's high was 3.41 yuan and its low was 3.18 yuan, a difference of 0.23 yuan, with an overall gain of 0.12 yuan. Trading volume was substantial, with a total of 4.8244 billion shares traded in half a day, including 62.7 million shares of Wing On Textile and 2.777 billion shares of King Fok Corporation (景福).</p>
<h3>Mixed Fortunes for Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Foreign stock market performance was mixed. Ewo Cotton Mills (怡紗) traded at 6300 and 6500 yuan, an increase of 300 yuan compared to the previous day. British-American Tobacco (英聯) remained flat, the same as last Saturday's closing price. Wheelock &amp; Co. (會德豐) saw a significant increase due to reports of financial and commodity price increases outside the trading circle, reaching 17,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan from the previous day. Other stocks remained relatively unchanged.</p>
<h3>Over 150 Jewelry Stores in the City Officially Reopen Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] More than 150 jewelry stores affiliated with the city's Jewelry Guild have already begun unofficial business operations starting at 10:00 AM yesterday. However, as it was a trial run, there were considerable discrepancies in the quoted prices for gold ornaments, ranging from a high of 160,000 yuan per tael to a low of 156,000 yuan. These prices already include a 10% legal profit margin and operating expenses, with labor costs calculated per item. Purchases will be made at prices reduced by 10% of the selling price. Starting today, the industry has decided to officially resume business, with daily operating hours from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. All members of the city's Jewelry Guild will display uniform prices, which will fluctuate dynamically with the market. Price quotations will be divided into three groups. The first group of 17 members is managed by Wu Pengnian of Bao Cheng Jewelry (寳成銀樓) in Xiaodongmen. The second group of 17 members is managed by Chen Dezhang of Wuhua Jewelry (物華銀樓) on Jinling Road. The third group of over 120 members is managed by Qiu Yunchang of Lao Tian Bao (老天寳) on Fuxing Road. All members will maintain constant contact with the three group leaders to obtain coordinated and accurate market prices. Furthermore, the industry has decided that today, those who use gold bullion to cast ornaments will need to pay an additional 5,000 yuan per tael to cover losses due to wastage.</p>
<h3>Rising Production Costs Boost Morale, Rice Prices Remain Firm, Flour, Grains, and Cooking Oil All Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market saw further increases. The opening market was supported by firm prices from the production areas, sharp increases in prices of other goods outside the industry, and strong overall sentiment. Prices generally rose by 3,000 yuan. Later in the day, as gold prices declined, morale weakened. In addition, rice shops had sufficient inventory, leading to sluggish sales and price declines of 400-500 yuan. Thin paddy rice was priced at 15,500 yuan, white glutinous rice at 15,300 yuan, and early indica rice and sheep indica rice were both at 15,000 yuan, while milled indica rice was at 14,800 yuan. The market registered 2,637 piculs of rice arriving yesterday.</p>
<p>Flour prices surged sharply. After the market opened, spurred by increases in other goods outside the industry, Lao Che (老車) flour quickly opened above 7,000 yuan. Prices briefly retreated in response to news of falling rice prices, but ample credit and heavy replenishment by local merchants, as well as significant buying by northern merchants, led to a rebound, with a closing price of 7,350 yuan. Ping Chuan (兵船) flour opened at 6,500 yuan, and strong sales drove the closing price up to 6,850 yuan. After the market closed, retail investors aggressively bought, pushing the final price up to 7,000 yuan. Bran was heavily bought by merchants from other provinces, rising by over 20%, with large bags of Fu Yan (阜鹽) selling for 5,560 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains experienced a frenzy of price increases. Soybeans were heavily bought by oil mills, with both Zha Dou (乍豆) and Che Dou (車豆) surging by 30%. Raw peanuts and sesame seeds were in high demand from local merchants and oil mills, with prices rising by 20% to 40%. Corn was heavily bought by the Qing Bang (靑帮), leading to a surge of over 30%. Red sorghum was in high demand from distilleries, soaring by 40%, with both ginger and Ming Guang (明光) closing near 7,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cooking oil market suddenly soared due to ample credit, rising gold and foreign exchange prices, and strong investor confidence. Soybean oil opened with a surge of 6,000 yuan. Retail investors were active in the middle of the day, with prices reaching as high as 67,000 yuan. At the close, many sellers took profits at the high prices, and smaller reports from outside the trading circle led to a slight decline, with a closing price of 65,000 yuan. Crude oil supplies were relatively scarce, driving prices up by 8,000 yuan, with Qingdao Ji Tong (靑島吉桶) breaking through the 70,000 yuan mark. Crude vegetable oil and sesame oil both showed strength. Soybean cakes were heavily sought after by merchants from other provinces, with the most dramatic price increases. Chang Zi (長字) cakes briefly reached 8,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Surge</h3>
<p>High-grade raw silk for separate orders opened at 820,000 yuan yesterday morning. Subsequently, the China Silk Company (中蠶公司) sold 20 piculs of Grade D Lion and Tiger brand silk, which was bought by local silk factories at a price of US$2.45 per pound, settled at an exchange rate of 2600 yuan, equivalent to 850,000 yuan per picul in gold yuan. As conditions in various markets shifted, the price of high-grade raw silk for separate orders rose to 930,000 yuan at the close, an increase of approximately 100,000 yuan from last Saturday. Other grades attracted little interest.</p>
<p>Artificial silk from Tianqiao (天橋) opened at 725,000 yuan, dropping to 705,000 yuan at one point. Snia Viscosa (斯尼亞西石) fell to 700,000 yuan. Prices rebounded at the noon close, ending at 780,000 yuan, also an increase of approximately 100,000 yuan from last Saturday. Arbitrage remained at 40%.</p>
<p>Huaqiang (華强) quilt covers opened at 550,000 yuan and closed at 505,000 yuan. Artificial silk quilt covers opened at 395,100 yuan and closed at 353,500 yuan. Bique crepe (碧縐) rose to 1,745 yuan. Prices of other items generally increased as well.</p>
<h3>Market Ramblings</h3>
<p>— A Spectator</p>
<p>The Winds of the Stock Market May Shift Tonight</p>
<p>Yesterday, the general market trend was up first, then down. The rumors of tighter credit circulating over the weekend, coupled with the pervasive "peaceful atmosphere" in the newspapers, were both reflected in yesterday's market.</p>
<p>However, the central bank's public denial of ending the issuance of gold yuan notes did not have much impact, nor did the rumors circulating in the market of issuing large 500-yuan notes.</p>
<p>The weekend rumors took effect yesterday, while the new events that occurred yesterday did not. This shows that the market yesterday was already tightly controlled over the weekend. Without the backing of major players, how could one have such power?</p>
<p>In this situation, one should be careful when trying to help the market by shorting stocks. The danger is akin to licking blood off a knife's edge, and it is not something that can be done without considerable financial strength.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that even if major players are willing to help, they understand that one can only go so far against the current. Therefore, one must be wary today. Given that it is the beginning of the month, and the central bank has publicly denied ending the issuance of gold yuan notes, perhaps it has already made its move. People in the stock market need to be even more careful.</p>
<p>Yesterday, yarn and cloth prices soared in a surprising performance, moving in the opposite direction to gold, silver, securities, and other commodities. Forty-two count blue phoenix yarn reaching 1 million yuan is enough to frighten anyone.</p>
<p>However, if one considers past market prices, it is reasonable to believe that the increase was excessive. If one considers that the transport of yarn and cloth to the south is currently being restored, and that prices in Hong Kong had stopped falling and started to rise again yesterday, then one cannot "judge the present by the past."</p>
<p>An important new development is that merchants from Hong Kong and Guangdong are buying in large quantities because the market for yarn and cloth in Hong Kong had temporarily declined due to the resumption of transport from this area, and had been quiet for almost three weeks. Last weekend, the market rebounded sharply due to large orders from South Africa, which was then reflected in the local market yesterday. Amidst the talk of a "peaceful atmosphere," the grain market should have been the first to be affected, leading the decline. Unexpectedly, the opposite happened, with rice and flour prices soaring yesterday, and cooking oil also rising sharply.</p>
<p>Why is this the case? The reason is very simple: the allocation price for household rice this period may relapse into chronic problems. Ignoring the fact that there is no news of ration coupons, it is a matter of hidden meaning. However, two things cannot be ignored: yesterday, Wuxi white glutinous rice fell by more than 500 yuan, and flour and wheat also fell by a significant amount.</p>
<p>Another thing is that after the United Nations lifted the global allocation system for cooking oil, oil prices in various countries have fallen sharply. In Hong Kong, for example, vegetable oil and tea oil have fallen by 10-20%.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the local market has changed into a playing field, and if the field changes, sales can be ignored.</p>
<h3>Increased Allocation of Rubber Products</h3>
<p>Factory Prices Expected to Increase by 20%</p>
<p>There are reports that factory prices for rubber products will be adjusted again, increasing by another 20%. Tire and rubber shoe merchants have been raising their selling prices to avoid losses from difficulty in replenishing stock after sales. However, recent large allocations from factories have led to abundant supply in the market. Quoted prices in the market have not been excessively high. Double Coin (雙錢) men's overshoes are selling for 12,900 yuan per dozen, large flat boots for 16,800 yuan, and high boots for 59,000 yuan, only slightly higher than last weekend. Trading in raw rubber is very sparse, with prices quoted at 500 yuan per pound yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Remains Firm, Boosting Morale in the Cloth Market</h3>
<p>The trend for cotton yarn remains strong, with continued morale boosting amidst loose credit conditions. Market prices continue to rise firmly. Yesterday, buying interest in the market remained very strong. Although those holding stock were reluctant to sell, fine yarn prices rose more sharply, while coarse yarn prices showed a slight increase.</p>
<p>Forty-two count blue phoenix yarn initially opened at a low of 870,000 yuan, then was bid up to 1 million yuan at one point, finally settling at 900,000 yuan, up 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Forty count blue phoenix yarn also rose by 100,000 yuan. Thirty-two count silver moon yarn was quoted down from 770,000 yuan to 700,000 yuan, but ended up surging by 110,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Twenty-one count double horse yarn for immediate delivery opened at 580,000 yuan, rose to 615,000 yuan, and then fell back to 560,000 yuan at the close, up 30,000 yuan from Saturday. Factory orders are currently at 530,000 yuan, with orders for delivery the day after tomorrow at 548,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Twenty count double horse yarn rose by 60,000 yuan, closing at 535,000 yuan. Other yarns, such as sixteen count coarse yarn, also showed strength. The cloth market was buzzing with rumors of favorable buying conditions, boosting morale. Combined with loose credit conditions, price fluctuations in other goods outside the industry, and renewed buying interest from industry players and merchants from Guangdong, who were actively replenishing stock, buying interest surged again, and cloth prices rose sharply.</p>
<p>High-grade fine cloth initially opened at 21,700 yuan, then rose to 23,200 yuan, finally settling at 23,000 yuan, a surge of 4,900 yuan from the weekend. Loudspeaker children's fine cloth rose by 3,700 yuan, closing at 20,600 yuan. Grade B high-grade fine cloth also rose by 3,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji (元嗶嘰) initially traded down from 20,400 yuan to 20,100 yuan, but rebounded to 21,000 yuan at the close, a jump of 4,000 yuan. Golden Luck Wonderful Dance Yuan Biji opened at 19,700 yuan in the morning, broke through the 20,000 yuan mark at noon, and finally closed at 20,300 yuan, up 3,600 yuan from before. The factory price for 290 high-grade shirting (士林) rose to 45,500 yuan. All other cloths also reached new highs.</p>
<h3>China Textile Sells Yarn as Usual</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Corporation (中國紡建公司) sold yarn yesterday as usual, continuing to use the quotation and approval system. A total of seven types were offered, with 221 lots sold and 91 buyers approved, with a total value of 163.04 million yuan. The selling prices for each type of yarn (in thousands of yuan) were: Eight count Sunlight (日光) at 285 yuan, sixteen count Jingyue (經月) at 455 yuan, twenty count double-strand Blue Phoenix (藍鳳) at 530 yuan, twenty-one count Fairy Peach (仙桃) second grade at 510 yuan, thirty-two count Sunlight at 630 yuan, forty count Red Treasure Light (紅寳光) at 810 yuan, and forty-two count double-strand Dragon Gate (龍門) at 830 yuan.</p>
<h3>Narrowing Sales Channels for Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>Sales channels for woolen fabrics have been narrowing recently. Aside from some purchases by merchants from Taiwan, sales are almost entirely reliant on local demand. Sales of each product have been declining daily. The vast markets of Northeast China and North China have disappeared, and due to transportation difficulties, merchants from the southwestern provinces rarely come to Shanghai to buy. Most of the woolen fabric sales in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi have been taken by smuggled goods from Hong Kong. These are all facts. At the same time, business in Shanghai is weakening due to unstable conditions, high prices, and a gradual decline in actual sales of both Western and Chinese clothing.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Soar Across the Board</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend yesterday was driven by actual sales from merchants in Hankou and some activity from merchants in Tianjin (although traffic in the north is blocked, merchants are still waiting for maritime transport to resume). Furthermore, the implicit interest rate has not tightened significantly, generally between 30% and 35%, resulting in brisk trading and soaring prices across the board. Grade 4.5 sugar opened at 27,800 yuan in the morning, then fluctuated around 27,000 yuan, finally closing at 27,200 yuan at noon, up over 2,000 yuan from last Saturday. Grade 3.5 sugar closed at 24,500 yuan, up 1,500 yuan. Coarse granulated sugar was at 2,600 yuan, up 2,300 yuan.</p>
<p>Green Sugar (靑糖) for extraction first reached 14,500 yuan, then rose to 15,000 yuan, finally closing at 155,000 yuan at noon, up 2,500 yuan. Prices for other grades also increased by about 10%.</p>
<p>Taiwan Sugar Corporation Approves Allocation of Coarse Granulated Sugar</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Taiwan Sugar Corporation (台糖公司) yesterday approved the allocation of Grade 52 coarse granulated sugar (200-斤 bags) at a price of 23,500 yuan per picul, resulting in the allocation of over 10,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Weakened Slightly in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>High Reached 161,000</p>
<p>[Our Report] The gold market trend yesterday was strong first, then weak. In the morning, before the market opened, sentiment was bolstered by the strength from last weekend and rumors of the imminent issuance of large denomination notes, leading to prices being bid up across the board, already reaching 156,000 to 159,000. The market opened at a high of 158,000 to 161,000 at 9:30 AM. However, the morning saw surprisingly loose credit conditions, with an endless supply of 3.5% interest rates, so prices fluctuated between 152,000 and 158,000. Around 11:00 AM, the Bank of Communications continued to release foreign exchange transfer certificates, leading to tighter credit conditions and a gradual weakening of prices. The market closed at 148,000 to 150,000. When the market opened in the afternoon, tight credit conditions persisted, with particularly tight conditions at 2:00 PM, with prices briefly reaching a low of 147,000 to 149,000, before rebounding to 152,000 to 154,000. The market ultimately closed at the lowest level of 147,000 to 149,000.</p>
<h3>Sales of Gold Bonds Temporarily Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>Principal to Be Drawn Tomorrow</p>
<p>[Our Report] Sales of the first issue of short-term gold bonds were temporarily suspended yesterday, with the principal to be drawn tomorrow. The National Bank's listed price remained at 114,500 yuan per tael, the same as last week's price. Since sales of the gold bonds began on February 11th, a total of 4,090 taels of bonds had been sold by the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Foundation Established Today</h3>
<p>The members of the Short-Term Gold Bond Fund Custodial Committee for 1949, representing various related agencies and organizations, had previously nominated representatives, and the Ministry of Finance had separately appointed them. As Minister Xu was in Guangzhou, the committee could not be established. With the first drawing of principal scheduled for March 2nd, the committee is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at 4:00 PM on March 1st in the conference room on the third floor of the Central Bank of China on Nanjing East Road. It is also reported that the committee members and government representatives are Fu Rulin, Liu Gongyun, and Chen Bingzhang; the representative of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce is Zhu Huiqing; the representative of the National Association of Banks and Commercial Associations is Xu Guomao; the representative of the National Association of Money Shops is Guan Nengchuang; and the representative of the Industrial Association is Zhuang Zhihuan, among others.</p>
<h3>Money Exchanges Prepare to Reopen</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced that the free trading of gold and silver would be permitted, money exchanges in the city are preparing to reopen. Money exchanges along Jiangxi Road and Sichuan Road are currently undergoing extensive construction and renovation. According to industry insiders, money exchanges were previously ordered to dissolve. Now that the government has opened up the trading of gold and silver, members of the industry have jointly petitioned the relevant authorities for permission to reopen.

<h3>Basketball League Second Round Begins, Jen Yu Faces McLaughlin Again, Tonight from 5:30 PM at the City Gymnasium</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The first round of the basketball league has successfully concluded, with the exception of three matches that have been rescheduled. The second round is scheduled to begin tonight, with the main match being Jen Yu (仁餘) versus the American team McLaughlin (麥令斯). There will be two Class Two matches before the main event, starting at 5:30 PM at the City Gymnasium. Ticket prices remain the same. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Huili (回力) vs. Huanan (華南) (Class Two B) 5:30 PM Di Xianzhang Wu Xiaodi</p>
<p>Typhoon (暴風雨) vs. West Qing Blue (西靑藍) (Class Two A) 6:30 PM Wang Jien Wu Shijian</p>
<p>Jen Yu vs. McLaughlin (Class One) 7:30 PM Chen Baolin Chen Songliang</p>
<p>Jen Yu has been vibrant recently, and very popular with fans, especially after their victory over the Shanghai Police a few days ago, which was quite spectacular. In addition to Wu Xinyun, Shen Pengju, Yao Wenyi, Sun Guozheng, Xu Zhongyi, and Wang Huaiding, they have also recently been joined by Cai Jindian, making their team even stronger. In the first round, Jen Yu beat McLaughlin by a large margin of 57 to 37. The American team improves with each game, and once they become familiar with the court, they are quite impressive. In the second friendly match, McLaughlin went all out and beat Jen Yu by one point, 37 to 36, avenging their previous loss. Tonight will be their third meeting. Although McLaughlin has lost all five of their games, their recent performance has been excellent. Jen Yu cannot afford to be complacent tonight. When these old rivals meet again, there will surely be a spectacular performance.</p>
<p>The first match, between Huili B and Huanan in Class Two B, will start first. Huili B has Bai Baokang, Wang Shide, Shang Chongyue, and Bao Youguan. These four knights easily defeated No Name in their first match, fully demonstrating their strength. However, Meng Xiancheng is unlikely to play due to a foot injury. Huanan also has well-known players such as Huang Tianlie, He Hanfu, Liu Fuqiang, and Li Xianzheng, so their team is not weak. However, Fuqiang made a mistake last week and lost to No Name, so it is likely that they will be defeated today as well.</p>
<p>The second match, between Typhoon and West Qing Blue in Class Two A, will feature Typhoon, a team composed of students from Nanyang Model High School. Under the guidance of American coach Stanlay Xiong, their basketball skills are impressive. West Qing Blue is more ordinary and unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>Tonight's Six Team Rosters</p>
<p>(Huili) Bai Baokang, Wang Shide, Shang Chongling, Shang Chongyue, Bao Youguan, Meng Xiancheng, Yao Liqun, Guo Yaosong, Lu Dinghou. (Huanan) He Hanfu, Huang Tianlie, Deng Guozhang, Li Xianzheng, Liu Fuqiang, Gao Jia, Zhang Daisong, Deng Songyu.</p>
<p>(Typhoon) Shen Shihua, Shen Shiqing, Fu Guozhu, Weng Moyuan, Ju Kejun, Jiang Yanzhen, Ye Songqiao, Zhou Denghe, Lu Zhendong, Li Yingheng.</p>
<p>(West Qing Blue) Sha Linsiqi, Ke En, Makin Tuo, Bao Gu, Ge Tuolisi, Po Langning, Hui Saike.</p>
<p>(Jen Yu) Wu Xinyun, Yao Wenyi, Zhuang Yirong, Shen Pengju, Li Zhaohe, Wang Huaiding, Cai Jindian, Sun Guozheng, Xu Zhongyi.</p>
<p>(McLaughlin) Lien, Oen Gai, Gefins, Laimushan, Fulaote, Pengkesidong, Hua Erfu, Ensiweitai, Qiaokesheng, Ounasi Gudi.</p>
<h3>Hai Qing vs. McLaughlin Scheduled for Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Two Friendly Matches Added Before</p>
<p>Three rescheduled matches remain in the Class One basketball league. The game between Hai Qing (海青) and McLaughlin has been scheduled by the Basketball Committee for tomorrow (Wednesday) at 7:30 PM at the City Gymnasium. Two friendly matches have been added before the main event. At 5:30 PM, the Ying Huang Youyi (影皇又一) team will face the Fat Team (胖隊), and at 6:30 PM, Green Forest (綠林) will face the US Navy Gantner fleet. Green Forest was the champion of Class Two last year. This year, as its players are divided among teams in Class One, it did not participate in the league. Now that Ye Yunshan, Chen Zhengmiao, and Wang Cunzhong have returned from overseas, they have reorganized and are preparing to show off in the friendly match. The US Navy fleet is new to Shanghai and has a lot of fighting power, so there will surely be many highlights. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Youyi - Fat Team (Friendly) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Green Forest - Gantner (Friendly) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Hai Qing - McLaughlin (Rescheduled) 7:30 PM</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Silver Shield Football Tournament: South China A Obtains the Right to the Finals; Lai Feng Jingxiang Scores with a Header; The Match Was Tense and Fierce; Deeply Touching the Hearts of the Fans</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong dispatch] Hong Kong football is now entering a white-hot stage. The important program of the "Special Silver Shield" has also reached the finals week. South China A, which has always been called the overlord of South China, has lived up to its mission and eliminated St. Joseph's last weekend (the 26th), obtaining the right to the finals.</p>
<p>This game gave the people of Hong Kong a very deep impression. It was tense and exciting, like watching an American Western martial arts film. As a result, South China A won with only one goal, and it was scored with a header.</p>
<p>Although South China A's lineup was incomplete, and Lai "Buddha" was forced to play with an injury, so they did not perform at their due level, but because St. Joseph's strength has increased, due to the one up and one down relationship, the game was played in a disorganized and chaotic way, forming a rare and exciting event. After the war, the people in St. Joseph's still lamented the loss, but some thought that the defeat was already known in advance, and only losing one goal in the end was something to be proud of. There was also someone who, in a joking tone, asked the reporter to write about yesterday's event as a "football war of attrition in a century," but I also jokingly said, "It's already flattering enough not to write about both sides being out of shape. If we're talking about reality, it can't even be said to be the best game of the year."</p>
<p>Shu Ling Worked Hard and Was Very Impressive</p>
<p>Some people thought that Zhang Shuling was the best player on the field because he played the game in a logical and methodical way, sometimes even dribbling the ball far out to assist in the attack. However, I do not think so, because to judge whether someone played well, you also have to consider who they were responsible for guarding. If Xiweiya had been the right winger throughout the game, and Shu Ling had still had the same impressive performance, then he should be praised and praised. However, for most of the time, he was only resisting Marquis, who had injured his foot, so this criticism cannot be made. Although his extra effort should also be praised, the person I want to particularly praise is St. Joseph's Schliwa. If it weren't for his super-level performance, South China A would have won more easily. Another person to praise is Tian Xiebo. With his short stature, he was able to adapt to either wing in the group of fierce players. Although Zhu Yongqiang's offside goal was not counted in the end, he had actually scored a goal. If this person could perform more often in the South China A team, his future would be limitless. The starting lineups for both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>South China A</p>
<p>Yu Yaode</p>
<p>Zhang Shuling</p>
<p>Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Zhang Jinhai</p>
<p>Xie Jinhong</p>
<p>Liu Songsheng</p>
<p>Xie Jinhe</p>
<p>Lai Zhaorong</p>
<p>Zhu Yongqiang</p>
<p>Tian Xiebo</p>
<p>Feng Jingxiang</p>
<p>St. Joseph's</p>
<p>Schliwa</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng</p>
<p>Gao Shanlong</p>
<p>Santos</p>
<p>Li Anna</p>
<p>Mendes</p>
<p>Parilla</p>
<p>Gan Meishi</p>
<p>Luo Cha</p>
<p>Marquis</p>
<p>Xiweiya</p>
<p>The Process is Tense and Touching</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, St. Joseph's launched a strong attack, which was quite promising. Although South China A attacked twice, they were quickly repelled. In the fifth minute, the famous "Dapu" pan Songsheng suddenly fired a heavy shot from 25 yards out, but unfortunately the shot was slightly too high and only hit the crossbar, unable to enter the goal. However, the momentum was so strong that the goal frame shook a few times. Even if the goalkeeper was a celestial being, he would not be able to block the shot. After the ball rebounded, "Sheng Gu" got it again and repeated the trick, but this time he shot too high and went into the empty space. It wasn't until the ninth minute that St. Joseph's had a chance to cross the ball, but it was cleverly rejected by Jingde. After that, South China A's momentum became fierce. In the tenth minute, Zhu Yongqiang shot with force from 20 yards away, but it was caught by Schliwa. Then, Tian Xiebo crossed the ball, and Yongqiang took the opportunity to rush in and try to head the ball, but he was bravely blocked by Schliwa. In the fifteenth minute, South China A encountered a dangerous situation. At that time, Luo Cha got the ball near the goal, but his footwork was not up to par. When he tried to shoot, his knee touched the ball, missing what seemed like a sure-win opportunity.</p>
<p>From then on, the ball was mostly controlled by South China A. In the 22nd minute, when Feng Jingxiang cleverly crossed the ball, the other four forwards rushed in like a swarm of bees. Lai Zhaorong welcomed the ball, and the short and agile Tian Xiebo responded by dribbling the ball in and shooting. He was not in any way committing a foul, but unfortunately, Zhu Yongqiang was offside in the center at the same time. Therefore, although Tian's shot was crisp and exquisite, it still could not be counted, which was really a pity.</p>
<p>Not long after this incident, Tian Xiebo also skillfully shot another goal, the ball was about to enter the net from the bottom of the crossbar, but Schliwa's skill was extraordinary, and he was able to jump up in time and push the ball out. After that, South China A used short triangular passes to attack the goal very urgently, but they were still guarded by St. Joseph's players. Around the 30th minute, Marquis's foot was slightly limping, so he switched to right wing, and Xiweiya filled in as right auxiliary. At this time, Feng Ershu often had wonderful crosses, but unfortunately, the other forwards mostly failed to take advantage of this opportunity. Once, Lai Zhaorong suddenly met Ershu's wonderful ball and shot in the air, but it was caught by Schliwa because he was in the right position. Although he was knocked to the ground outside the goal line by the incoming ball, he was still able to hold the ball firmly and flip over to save the situation. Once, Jinhe also shot in the air, and once, Yongqiang shot, but they were all confiscated by Schliwa. The first half ended in a zero-to-zero draw.</p>
<p>South China A's Goal Encountered Great Danger</p>
<p>In the second half, South China A had Feng Jingxiang and Tian Xiebo switch positions. Tian's wing skills were also quite good. In the seventh minute, Zhu Yongqiang's shot was caught. In the ninth minute, Tian Xiebo crossed the ball, and Yongqiang used his head to diagonally top the ball near the goal, which seemed certain to score, because Schliwa was drawn to the right at that time, and the ball was just about to scurry into the empty space on the left. However, St. Joseph's had good luck. When Schliwa flipped over to save the ball, his finger touched the incoming ball, and it bounced diagonally out of bounds. South China A only got a corner kick, which was of no help in the end. Once again, Tian Feng exchanged passes and advanced. When crossing the ball, Yongqiang rushed in and headed the ball close to the goal, but unfortunately he missed it and lost a good opportunity. As such, South China A occupied about 80% of the attack, but the only difference was that they could not get the ball into the net. For a while, the Chinese spectators were anxious and cheered for South China A. In the 25th minute, South China A had a dangerous moment. At that time, Xiweiya suddenly shot a cold arrow from about 30 yards away. The ball came from the left of the goal, and although Yu Yaode was just able to push it away in time, he still conceded a corner kick. Xiao Gao thought that the opportunity was rare and took the corner kick himself, but he lost practice and kicked the ball behind the net, only causing the audience to laugh and ridicule. In the 32nd minute, South China A encountered a major danger again. At that time, Parilla dribbled the ball in. Although Hou Zi was chasing him and Jinhong was flanking, Xiao Pa still bravely advanced. Seeing the ball rolling towards the goal, Jingde ran out to pick it up, but because there was a family member in front of him, he couldn't help but slow down slightly. However, he was snatched by Parilla, who stole the ball and passed it back. At that time, Luo Cha welcomed it and shot at the empty goal. The ball fell under the crossbar, which was very dangerous. Fortunately, Jingde was able to anticipate the loss and quickly retreated, returning to the goal line just as the ball arrived. He jumped up in the air and pushed the ball over the top of the net, saving the catastrophic event, although he conceded another corner kick.</p>
<p>Ershu's Pleasing Header Succeeded</p>
<p>After surviving a great disaster, there must be good fortune. This is true. Just three minutes after South China A escaped the great danger, Xie Jinhe suddenly got the opportunity to shoot diagonally at the goal. The cunning Feng Jingxiang saw an opportunity to take advantage of it and rushed in at the same time. At that time, Schliwa had already taken a position and was ready to catch the ball shot by Jinhe, but before the ball reached his hand, it was shaken by Ershu's head, and the ball changed direction into the net, so South China A opened the scoring amidst thunderous cheers.</p>
<p>After losing this goal, St. Joseph's knew that the general trend was gone, so they made a desperate decision. Xiao Gao went out to play as a center forward, and Luo Cha retreated to play as a right back, but Xiao Gao was no longer as lively as before and had no way to retaliate. Until the 90 minutes of the game were over, the score was still a blank sheet, so South China A won the final with a score of one to zero.</p>
