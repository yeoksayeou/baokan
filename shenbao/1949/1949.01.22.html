<h3>海總否認遷台灣</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕合衆社廿日南京電稱「海空軍總部遷往台灣及陸軍總部遷往廣州之正式命令已頒發」。據海軍總部發言人今聲明，該部並未奉到是項命令，現仍在京照常辦公，該項消息，毫無根據。</p>

<h3>白崇禧時局談話　中共所提條件均可商量惟望推誠相見促成和平</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢口廿一日電〕白總司令崇禧，頃對時局發表談話如下：「我國鬩墻三載，創痛已深，但求和平實現，解余人民痛苦，中共所提各項條件，均可商量，今和平之門旣開，惟望雙方推誠相見，早日促成和平大局以後並切實做到政治民主化，軍隊國家化，經濟社會化，以建立新中國」。</p>
<h3>折衝和平代表人選　可能為張治中羣邵力子吳忠信中共發言人抨擊政院對和談決議</h3>
<p>〔太報南京廿一日電〕此間觀察家相信，蔣總統毅然引退，促成和平，將使今後政局有決定性之發展。李副總統代行總統職權，係自廿二日開始，孫科內閣總辭，不致爲李氏接受，勢將仍由孫氏繼續負責，俾與李代總統合作。就蔣總統引退之感召，而使和平迅速實現，惟孫閣中一二閣員或略有更動，若然，則孫科組閣時盛傳入閣但未實現之黃紹竑氏，可能加入政院，担任某一部會首長，其他閣員不致有大變動。至與共黨停戰言和事，孫科將就其責任所及，予以決定，傳張治中·張羣·邵力子·吳忠信四氏，廿二日已奉命担任與中共折衝，尙未能獲得關係方面之證實，惟衆信如與共黨談判，此四氏當爲最適宜之人選。關於中共廣播必取消政院十九日決議始能談判之意見，殆屬孫科進行和議之最大困擾，然此事可望以逕派代表進行商談以冲淡其重要性。設孫氏堅持先停戰後談判之決定，則和平之實現顯必尙有若干挫折</p>
<p>中共發言人　談話原文</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕自蔣總統元旦文吿發表後，和平之門已啓，一月十九日行政院之停戰決議，卽係對和平商談之進一步表示，此爲世人所共見者，廿一日晚據新華社廣播中共發言人談話，認爲行政院決議雙方先行停戰，使「和平之門從此關死了」，顯見中共對於全國人民所蘄求之和平，必須先談條件，而後停戰言和平，茲誌新華社廣播原文如下。</p>
<p>『南京國民黨反動政府官方通訊社中央社十九日電稱，十九日上午九時，行政院會議廣泛討論時局，決議如下「政府爲遵從全國人民之願望，蘄求和平之早日實現，特愼電表示願與中共雙方立卽先行無條件停戰，並各指定代表進行和平商談。」（中國共產黨發言人稱：南京行政院的這個決議，沒有提到一月一日南京偽大總統蔣介石建議和平談判的聲明，也沒有提到一月十四日中國共產黨毛澤東主席建議和平談判的聲明，沒有表示對於這兩個建議究竟是擁護那一個，反對那一個，好像一月一日和一月十四日國共雙方並沒有提出過甚麼建議一樣，却另外提出了自己的建議，這是完全令人不能理解的。在實際上，南京行政院不但完全忽視中共一月十四日的建議，而且直接推翻了僞大總統蔣介石一月一日的建議。（下轉第二版）</p>
<h3>淮河戰局復緊張　共軍十餘萬分路南進中　高郵洪澤兩湖區部隊積極渡淮</h3>

<h3>總統謀和之誠意</h3>
<p>總統昨日發表文吿，因元旦俏導和平迄未實現，戰事至今猶未停止，戡亂目的旣難貫澈，和平希望仍復渺茫，乃依據憲法，交李副總統代行職權，繼速謀取和平，俾救人民出於水火。總統自己並　於昨日飛離首都，回浙小憇，藉示其謀和之誠意。</p>
<p>自總統元旦昭示：天下只要和平果能實現，個人之進退出處絕不縈懷，和平之門蓋已大啓；徒以中共毛澤東氏之廣播，依然劍拔弩張，惡聲相向，充滿了火藥氣味，和平之望不絕如縷。所幸行政院有雙方先行立即停戰各派代表商談之決議，國民黨中政會更追認於後，至是而全國是否即能停戰言和？已全擊於共黨之答覆。昨天總統又毅然交由李副總統代行職檢，且經國民黨中常會之通過，更足徵國民黨以及中樞當局了解全國人民痛苦之深，不惜盡其全力，感格共黨，以冀和平之神確能降臨於中國。</p>
<p>假使中共黨人尚能不忘其爲同爲中國人民，尚能自守其「解放」人民之諾言，尚能顧及其所謂「迅速結束戰爭」之廣播，應即懸崖勒馬，同意停戰，開誠商談，以竟和平之全功，副人民之期望。</p>
<p>於此，吾人站在國民立塲，有須深切認識而願爲傘代總統與政府諸公吿　，即：總統謀和之誠，原爲人民着想，而人民渴望和平之代價，則自有其必守之界　，質言之，吾人不能因求和平而犧牲國　之獨立完整，不能因求和平而拋棄國體之民主憲政，不能因求和平而斷送去人民之自由生活，更不能　求和平而幷人民　仰之生活水準亦復不能保障。故求和平則可，求和平而犧牲自己則可，求和平而犧牲人民則不可，求和平而取悅於共黨竟置國家於極權專制的「鐵慕」之內則小可。前天美國杜魯門總統就職官言說的好：「和平不能由取悅共黨以獲致，而祗能從增强自由國家在經濟軍事及社會方面之力量以獲致。」深願政府諸公於爭取和平聲中三復斯言！</p>
<h3>白塘沽安全完成撤退　侯鏡如飛抵首都　十七兵團決調駐京滬綫</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕堅守塘大之國軍第十七兵團司令官侯鏡如將軍，於奉命安全撒退完成後，廿日乘艦抵靑島，廿一日午十二時半與劉安祺同機抵京，廿一日已先後　謁顧總長祝同等，廿二日將繼續訪晤各軍政首長，所部第十七兵團，十六日安全撤出塘沽後，已有一部到達青島，餘尚在乘船赴靑途中。聞當局爲加强京滬綫防務，已決定將十七兵團調駐上海及京滬綫，侯氏本人亦將調京滬杭警備總司令部任某項要職，惟俟氏廿一日晚接見記　時，對上述消息未予肯定承認僅稱現尚未定。據侯氏語記者，此次塘沽撤退，於奉命後數小時內完成，國軍之損失不及一營，所有彈藥物資糧食及馬匹等，均全部安全運出，除海軍强大艦隊掩護並擔任運輸外，並動員大小船隻一百餘艘。現我海軍强大艦隊仍在渤海中巡邏監視匪軍行動，並隨時可以登陸。侯氏並稱，此次撤退時，塘沽新港工程均未破壞，塘大仍完好如初，以保全國家之建設。</p>

<h3>中共發言人談話　（上接二版）</h3>
<p>蔣介石在其壹月壹日的建設中說：「只要共黨一有和平的誠意，能作確切的表示，政府必開誠相見，願與商討停止戰爭恢復和平的具體方法」。過了拾九天，同一個政府的一部分機構，卽南京政府的「行政院」，卻推翻了這個政府的「大總統」的聲明，不是「必開誠相見，願與商討停止戰爭，恢復和平的具體方法」，而是「立卽先行無條件停戰，並各指定代表，進行和平商談」了。我們要問南京「行政院」的先生們，究竟是你們的建議爲有效呢？還是你們的「大總統」的建議為有效呢？你們的「大總統」把「停止戰爭，恢復和平」認為是一件事，聲明必定開誠相見，願與中共商討實現這件事的具體方法，你們則將戰爭與和平分別爲兩件事，不願意派出代表和我們商討停止戰爭的具體方法，而卻異想天開地建議先行立卽「無條件停戰」，然後再派代表「進行和平商談」，究竟是你們的建議對呢？還是你們的「大總統」的建議對呢？我們認爲僞行政院是越出了自己職權，它們沒有資格推翻僞大總統的建議，而其至做出新建議。我們認爲南京「行政院」的這個新建議是沒有理由。打了這麼久，這麼大，和這麼殘酷的戰爭，自應雙方派人商討基本的停戰協定，戰爭纔能平下來，不但人民有這種希望，就是國民黨方面，也有許多人表示了這種希望。如果照南京「行政院」毫無理由的決議，不先行停戰，就不願意舉行和平談判，則國民然的和平誠意在什麼地方？南京「行政院」的決議做出來了，不先行停戰，就沒有和談的可能了，和平之門從此關死了。而如果要談判，則祗有取消這個毫無理由的決議，兩者必居其一。如果南京「行政院」不願意取消自已所謂的決議，那就是表明南京國民黨反動政府並無與其對方進行和平談判的誠意。人們要問「南京方面或有誠意」，爲什麼不願意商討和平的條件。南京的和平建議是虛僞的，這樣一種結論，難道不是已經證實了。南京現在已陷入無政府狀態，僞大總枕一個建議，偽行政院一個建議，這叫人們和誰去打交道呢。」</p>
<p>中共暗示要求參加佔領日本</p>

<p>〔又電〕印外交部今晚汲表公吿謂：亞洲會議今晚秘密會議，曾討論下述五點：（一）恢復印尼共和國政府之完全自由行動；（二）以印尼共和國政府於十二月十八日保有之領土歸還該政府，荷軍自該地撤退；（三）組織臨時政府；（四）選舉一制憲會議，以政權交印尼合衆國；（五）由安理會組成一委員會或他種團體，授予適當權力，俾實施上述諸建議。上述各點將開列於由四國草擬委會提出之建議中。</p>
<p>〔合衆社新德里廿日電〕亞洲國家廿日在海德里巴德宮中舉行秘密會議，決議要求安理會在本年年底以前命令完成印尼獨立。該會議並同意向安理會建議，命令荷軍立卽撒退至十二月十八日之界綫，此項撒退必須在三月十五日以前完成·亞洲國家並將要求安理會保證在三月十八日以前重建一改組之臨時印尼政府，但該會並未規定印尼制憲會議召開之日期。然大部份代表，認爲此會應在十月中舉行，俾本年年底前，可完成將政權交與共和國。關於制裁荷蘭問題，將於廿一日討論之，此一問題之通過，諒無疑義。亞洲會議將於廿二日討論目前之會議是否將爲永久性之組織，預料此事將發生普遍之破裂。</p>

<p>〔又電〕美對荷印問題修正案，主張由安理會設立印尼事件處理委員會，建議撒退荷軍辦法，但無權發出命令。此點與美國原來方案不同。此外並要求荷印雙方停戰，釋故印尼政洽領袖，且在明年七月一日前設立印尼聯邦。</p>
<h3>荷總理特里斯　已遄返海牙</h3>
<p>與印尼談判尚未獲協議</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞二十日電〕荷蘭總理特里斯在東印度視察兩星期後，今日啓程返海牙，據談，兩星期來荷蘭與印尼領袖問之會議，已採取若干正當步驟，第一，關於組織印尼聯邦臨時政府，荷蘭巳提供積極諾言，其次印荷雙方已進一步接觸，並造成一種氛圍，可使關係各方面進行新磋商。最近雙方談判之主要目的有三：卽：（一）迅速組織印尼聯邦臨時政府；（二）迅速準備組織獨立印尼聯邦，俾自荷蘭接受主權；（三）舉行自由選舉·國際對於組織印尼聯邦政府問題之關切倘稍消减，談判反將更有效果。余曾與印尼共和國前總理沙利一度談判，雙方開誠相見，力謀合作。荷關與印尼共和國各領袖能否成立最後協議，尙待印尼方面檢討。</p>

<h3>三件大衣一支槍明知兄弟非善類　無賴向姊恫嚇被報吿拘獲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕時屆廢曆歲暮，盜匪蠢動，刦案迭出，南市　境內，時有一般歹徒，實行所謂「頓進硬出」之勾當。有　警副大隊長彭榮發，與妻徐氏，寓居陸家浜路德興里一號，彭有內弟徐永林，綽號「殺頭鬼」，係一無賴。十九日晚九時，永林乘姊夫外出時，手持手槍一支，闖入其家，向乃姊恫嚇，幸氏機警，設計脫身外出，據情報吿蓬萊分局，經李股長飭股員陸紀鴻率警長趙春普·李鳳詠·幹警李顯汶·卞錫承·陳海林等往捕，則巳逃逸。比至翌晨一時許，始在大東門一帶之棚戶內將徐永林及其羽黨俞福昌（渾號小福昌）一併捕獲，在俞犯身畔抄獲槍套一只，經帶局偵訊，均矢口否認有不法行爲。惟經偵查結果，獲悉二犯前曾犯竊盜案累累。</p>

<h3>銀根鬆　買氣濃　食米漲風又起　麵粉上落不多食油續見挺升</h3>
<p>米市昨挺升，因上日其他物價上漲甚多，而米價反見下降，故人心望高，貨主竭力扳持，加之銀根鬆濫，增强買氣。北市塲白粳做一千六百七十元，計漲一百二十元，薄稻漲七十元，早稻亦漲一千五百五十元，秈米漲一百元，臉白元各漲五十元，南米市塲初開漲五六十，後買氣濃厚，再見上挺，結果早稻漲一百五十元，薄稻升百二十元。昨日到貨南北二市塲共計七千六百七十一石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>升沅不一，惟上落不多，因北銷呆滯，籌碼頗爲充斥，加之業外各物尚平，人心平穩。老車粉僅開一價爲六百五十元，略昂二元。兵船粉六百二十二元，反疲三元。紅峰降五元，建成小十元，雜牌粉軋升五元至十元不等。大包麩皮漲五元五十元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>繼續上漲，黃豆實銷轉暢，乍豆車豆油廠吸取，提升二百元，九江冬豆客帮納進，晋升二成半，平湖杜豆普升二百元，苞米先漲後回，終見軋升，芝蔴微升百元，紅糧再漲一成，生仁漲勢轉劇，緣因時局關係，產區來源大减，執戶乘機扳持不放，人心堅昂。揚州生仁疾升六百元，竄出三千大關，菉豆堅定，赤豆激升。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>續見挺升，以豆油及生油上漲最多，昨日開市漲五百元，中途因銀根鬆濫益甚，散戶納取，上漲最力，收市因業外物價上漲不多，市又轉疲，豆油自七千元開市，一度曾至七千五百元高價，收市退爲七千三百元，軋漲八百元，吉桶生油高達八千元，猛漲一千八百元，惟收市賣不出，生菜油貨多，略漲四百元，豆阱先升後平，挺二十元。</p>
<h3>銀根更見鬆濫　日拆最高五十元</h3>
<p>昨晨本市銀根，走勢益見鬆動，各業市塲暗息，再度下降，平均做價爲四十五元。絲綢市塲因頭寸特鬆，僅做四十元左右，紗布市塲，則因成交較盛，做價略高，爲五十元左右。國行電貼現及日拆利息，仍維原價不動。</p>
<h3>特種外幣存單　先發強制收購部份</h3>
<p>特種外幣存單，中央銀行仍在加速準備製發中，因分戶塡發手續較緊，下週始可發出，頃悉國行仍擬先發强制收購部份，可分三季抵用，八季開始，至十季截止。聞數字極小，祗數千美元，第二批再發優先承購部份。</p>
<h3>市塲游資增多　計達十億元以上</h3>
<p>近日內地匯來上海之匯款，又見增多，銀根趨鬆，又思蠢動，相繼向市塲吸收物資，估計結集市塲游資又增至十億以上，雖中紡中信局等繼續拋售物資，仍不足供應吸收，故物價又見升騰。</p>
<h3>央行以一億五千萬元　收購紡織成品</h3>
<p>棉織業爲發放工人年賞，所需現款至鉅，特聯袂要求央行收購棉紗成品。昨晨六區紡織業，特推派代表往訪央行商洽收購事宜，由李立俠接見，經決定卽日由央行加以收購，其價格計算方式，則以各成品成本加工繳折合而成，故每件收購實額有較現行市價爲低，有較現行市價爲高。收購總額共計一億五千萬元，聞是項價款，今日卽可發出。</p>
<h3>僑匯昨日掛高　外匯證仍無起色</h3>
<p>外匯移轉證，昨市仍無起色，晨開一七〇元，一度升至一七五元，因交易淸淡，收市又退回一七〇元。又僑匯牌價昨有改動，改爲二一〇元，較昨掛高一〇元</p>

<p>呢羢平疲</p>
<p>昨週五，呢羢市氣趨疲行情亦皆轉平，光毛粗細各貨脚地均虛，買者無幾，各檔大衣呢較週初平均每碼跌三分鈿之譜，花呢嗶　宣維等，平均縮跌十分之一二。</p>
<p>桐油俏升</p>
<p>邇來桐油市况，交易成僅零星，緣因農歷歲暮，日近一日，同業方面，大都無意授受，而其趨勢，自銀根步鬆後，本屬倘利無比，但昨市更以食油行情，登峯造極，執貨者心思益形激昂，喊價跟隨猛晋，致漲風洶湧未已，各貨一致劇增千元有奇。</p>
<h3>中紡仍掛牌開售　棉紗初升終降</h3>
<p>棉紗昨日走勢，先高後低，業內銀根有寬有鬆，但業外各物普見回軟，金融黑市走勢盤旋，人心轉平，納胃亦淡。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳，晨以九一〇〇〇元喊做，喊後美援會再掛牌開售，供量又充，人心頓軟，散戶反進爲出，行情小落二千元，嗣後大戶了結，走勢益軟，一路喊低，小至七九〇〇〇元收市，回小七〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>四十支跟小三五千元，三十二支暴落八九千元，二十一支雙馬晨開時，人心尙堅，喊價未小，檯面尚多拉抬，初喊六一〇〇〇元，瞬息好起二千元，但喊價買氣不旺，人心見疲，嗣後美援會掛牌拋壓，市况慘瀉，檯面反進爲出，散多跟漲，市價直綫下游，收市五一三〇〇元，跌八五〇〇元。</p>
<p>棉布盤堅</p>
<p>棉布走勢盤堅，和平傳說轉盛，當局又有登記物資之議，敏感者多具戒心，稍有脫手，業中銀根仍鬆，日拆千元，在四十五元左右。四君子元嗶嘰，初疲後堅，以二二〇元開盤後，卽喊低至二〇八〇元，臨收步升至二一九〇元，結果仍以二一七〇元收盤，與上日平，金蓮妙舞，最後做二千二百元，軋堅七十元。雷峯塔元嗶嘰，升至二一三〇元，四君子直貢客帮有進，獨堅二百元，龍頭細布交少價堅，仍爲二三五〇元，五福細布喇叭童及龍頭B細布，均以二〇五〇收市，微露秀色，餘多站原盤，成交約七千疋左右。</p>

<h3>絲綢一再挫跌</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况先高後軟，初因金價尚好，游資汹湧，買氣尚旺，人心似頗監　，喊價開盤卽高，嗣因年關迫近，各業按排頭寸，業外各物普見軟化，外匯證又無起色，金價回低，人心轉淡。</p>
<p>一二〇號天橋初以九一〇〇〇元開喊，大戶急劇了售，市况曁軟，前市收盤八七〇〇〇元，後市銀根稍緊，金價再吿盤挫，人心益疲，散多更番脫手，趨勢續軟，喊價續小二〇〇元。</p>
<p>生絲外匯移轉證日來盤旋無起色，洋行帮納胃吿停，絲織業已屆放假停工時期，實銷亦淡，交易頗爲淸淡，優級零擔晨以九六〇〇〇元開喊，半嚮無人問津，檯面靜如止水，業外紗布回小，人心恍惚不定，收市仍見回小，最後以九二五〇〇元結束。</p>
<p>綢緞初受金價波動影響，開盤後卽見昂升，嗣後金價回小，買氣轉淡，喊價又小，但因業外游資近日無所出路，紗布被壓，目褾轉移，市况軟後再堅，收市多見軋升。美亞被面晨開五三五〇〇元喊叫，喊後檯面競起拉抬，瞬息好起五〇〇〇元，高後浮多了結。空施壓力，市勢卽見軟弱，而業外各物更見疲軟，人心萎　，前市五六五〇〇元收束，後市脚地仍軟，喊價又小四〇〇〇元。</p>
<h3>台糖先高後平</h3>
<p>食糖昨日市勢轉挺，各檔均見高升，市上銀根轉鬆，暗息回低，執戶尤多觀望，惟因年關迫近，和謠空氣傳說紛紜，市勢先高後平。</p>
<p>四五號車白精晨開時走勢鋒倘，人心頗昂，各檔籌碼似不見多，客帮買意殷切，喊價向高峯挺進。嗣後金價回小，謠言紛紜，人心頗多顧忌，市勢高後轉軟，午後三六〇〇元，再升二〇〇元，粗砂亦好二〇〇元，餘如興白赤合赤海赤綿赤刁靑等，均昂升二百元左右。</p>

<h3>杭州：漫談不設防</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十九日航訊〕戰亂頻仍，全國各大都市都担心於砲火的襲擊，所以都在斷斷續續作不設防城市的幻想。北平·天津，在若干日子以前，巳作公開的呼籲，但是砲火無情，終於還是遭到了波及。</p>
<p>馳名世界的風景區杭州，最近由於火藥味的漸次接近，於是也有「不設防城市」的微弱呼聲。起因是這樣的：杭州市參議會議員們，想到戰禍的可怖，在一次會議席上，由議長張衡道出「杭州不設防城市」的要求。本月份的市參議會大會，張衡在開幕詞中，正式說明要通電雙方，「杭州爲不設防城市」，並且也强調了杭州一向「反對內戰」。</p>
<p>記者遍尋了典籍中關於所謂不設防城市的解釋，據實用辭典戰：「卽未曾設有防禦工事的城市，按之國際公法，兩國開職時，不得轟炸不設防城市」。又據鄭斌著戰時國際法第一一七而載稱：「海牙陸戰規則第二十五條規定：不論用如何手段，不得攻擊或砲擊無防地域，（城市·村落·房屋）此條亦禁止飛機從空中炸擊，然何謂無防地域，有解釋之餘地」。又蔡可成著非常時期之國際法稱：「（甲）海牙規則禁止依無論何種方法攻擎無防禦的城鎭村落住宅或建築物，換言之，國際法只許交戰國砲擊有防禦的城鎭，但此所謂「有防禦」，係指駐有軍隊而言，並非有堡壘之意義，又海牙規則所謂「依無論何種方法」，其意義殆亦包含</p>
<p>空中飛機之攻　在內。（乙）對於有防禦的城鎭全部，交戰國可不管砲壘房屋顴行砲擊，但不得對無防禦的私人房屋施以攻擊，同時對於宗敎藝術，科學慈善等文化機構或建築物及病院等，在當時無防禦而不供軍用者，務須設法保全，惟此種機構及建築，須將其可由遠方望及之特別標識，先行通知敵軍」。</p>
<p>基於以上所述，我們知道所謂「不設防城市」是起於國際的戰爭，而非指內戰而言。然而在第二次世界大戰中，德奧飛彈於英法的無防城市，日本飛機對於我國後方不設防城市，肆意濫炸，引起全世界輿論的抨擊。但是，後來英法藉口復仇，也有同樣的舉動。這都可說已經破壞了「不設防城市」的規則。</p>
<p>在兩次世界大戰中，眞正沒有受到戰火波及的，那就是永久中立國的瑞士，瑞士風景秀麗與杭州相若，文化機構林立，人民生活及文化水準甚高，他們的大學·中學·小學，規模之大，爲我國萬萬所不及，而文化活動遍及每個角落，研究專門學問的圖書館等，不知多至若干所，因爲如此，所以她得以緩姆了國際間的戰爭，保全了自己的安全，但是在一九三九年九月二日，德波戰爭的第二日，瑞士也不得不實施軍事動負，九月三日，卽英法對德宣戰日，瑞士更形緊張，幸德軍顧念這風景綺麗的世界文化堡壘，而逕由荷比攻法。又第一一次世界大戰中，因法比受第一次大戰的敎訓，兩國在其國土東部建</p>
<p>堅固防綫如德國經瑞進軍攻法之　奇諾防綫右後方，且因法國瑪奇諾防綫右翼爲法東部防綫較弱之一環，可由此直攻法第二道堡壘綫的後方。與由比進攻之德軍配合，完成對巴黎兩翼之延伸與迂迥，但是後來又因爲顧念這風景綺麗的世界文化堡壘，才捨易就難，逕攻荷比入法。因此，我們又可明瞭，國際上永久中立國者，尚有比利時，而比利時在兩次大戰中均不能避免，而瑞士獨能轉危爲安，其意義何在？這一次的國共戰爭是國內的戰爭，是否以杭州這樣的地位能够適用於國際戰爭規則而引伸到國內戰爭的立塲？當爲一個問題。同時，所謂「不設防城市」的許多前提條件，是不是能够做到？亦是一個問題。不過，記者認爲杭州確實是風景綺麗的地方，可惜僅有很少的文化建設，如果能够加强文化的建設，使杭州不獨有綺麗的外表，而有豐富的內容，則戰爭的作戰單位，也不忍毀壞這風景綺麗的文化堡壘了。</p>
<p>這次市參議會大會，附帶將討論記者所主張的「杭州建設爲文化城」的問題，他們已在開幕典禮中兩度道及，我們希望迅速地促其成功！</p>
<h3>無錫各社團　響應和平</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫廿日訊〕本邑各社團，近以京滬各處，紛紛函詢錫人對於和平意見，當由縣商會理事長錢孫卿，議長李惕平等，彙集各函，特於昨日邀集公私社團臨時召集人會議商談，經歸納各人所採地方意見，公推錢孫卿主稿，定廿二日簽名發出，原稿略謂：烽火已迫眉睫，和戰未決朝堂，軍隊徬徨，人民恐懼，總統元旦文吿，諄醇三民主義未能實現，國家危機，更加嚴重，引爲已咎，更因軍事加重人民負担，加深人民痛苦，對於人民希望和平及早實現，不能不作深長的考慮。至中共聲明，無論條件如何，亦主張迅速結束戰爭，减少人民痛苦，總之，皆可歸納於召開政治協商會議，一切問題自易解決，我無鍚人民公私社團，謹以至誠，擁護總統元旦文告之主張，認爲在政府倡導和平原則下應先注意下列數事，提前實施：（一）廢止特種刑庭，及對於人民不屬軍事範圍之軍事審判，（二）釋放因嫌被逮及一切在押之政治犯，（三）開放人民正當輿論，及停止各地搜捕政治反動份子等項，以期實臻民主和平。</p>
<h3>福州村中人語</h3>
<p>— 本掃特約記者　鄭時渚</p>
<p>〔本報福州十九日航訊〕當一個從南京或上海經過三們小時航程飛抵福州機塲上空的時候，最先觸入眼簾的是附近散落的村莊，縱橫的阡陌，密密疏疏的樹林和四圍寬闊靜靜的河流。</p>
<p>自保農社與農會成立後，佃農與地主之問當常在收穫的季節發生糾紛，今日的地主多爲後落的富豪。佔地多在十畝與三十畝之間，在地方上常有殘餘的優越感，他們仰給於士地的收入，因受土地法令的限制，連年災旱的損收，以及納稅的苛重，也感到殘喘一息了，所以每屆分收，必爭得臉紅耳赤，竭力不使佃農達到土地法令中所得的數目，各鄕村的土紳勢力不一，因此造成各種不同的臨時默契，甚至老實的佃農則絲毫未沾得新法令的恩惠。新土地法上將徵收擁地三十畝以上的超越土地，可是在這數十里周圍的鄕村中，擁地達三十畝以上的實在太少了。</p>
<p>當你想在鄕村中買一點農業副產品的時候，有時你會碰上一個釘子，你想買一隻二斤重的母鷄時，他們要的是廿二斤穀子，原來鄕村中的交易多半已用穀子做交換的媒介了。但是零星的買賣，還是不能不用紙幣，這變成一個新的複本位制。</p>
<p>靜靜的鄕村中，近來憑添許多由不安靜的地方來的客人，一種是榮譽軍人，他們散佈在各村莊兩三百人或數十人不等，他們手上的紙幣價値，往往比平民爲高。他們也常常受着各種不得已的免費優待，戰亂中的軍風紀問題，每是一種頭痛問題。另一種是操着不同語言的異鄉媳婦，疏散翁家爲啞婦，或是外地生長的兒童，他們也本能的學會盲啞學校的手語。</p>
<p>京滬緊急疏散期中，福州市內的房屋不敷需用，於是鄕村的廟堂或大屋也都貼上疏散機關的對用紙條，鄕村的農民都在希望和平早臨，希望這些紙條早日自動撕去。</p>

<h3>廣西大學先修班　兩敎授互毆</h3>
<p>桂林職校師生起糾紛</p>
<p>〔本報桂林十八日航訊〕國立廣西大學先修班三百餘學生，爲全體直升問題，與校方僵持未決，十七日又發生敎授毆鬥之怪事。緣該校副敎授詹道明以柳州某私立中學董事長名義，向學生募捐基金，所獲頗鉅，事爲副敎授王朝偉吿到校方，謂詹要挾學生捐款，學生學科成績高低視捐款多寡而定，經校方查明，並無其事，斥王無故生端，王因此挾恨在心，於校園相遇時，飽詹以老拳，當時頭破血流，衆敎授與學生等以王無理，羣起支援，並提三條伴令王接受：（一）請王辭職，（二）向詹道歉，（三）賠償醫藥’王亦自知理虧，乃捲囊而去。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕繼廣西大學風彼之後，又有省立桂林職業學校師生糾紛，事緣該校紡一班學生，因對敎導主任陳煊不滿，於十四日包圍陳於辦公廳質詢，謂陳辦事不公，校長不理校務，事後又向省府省參會請求撒換敎導主任與懲罰校長，該校當局爲此事向社會人士辯正五點：（一）校長經常在校住宿，處理校務，十四日學生吳立鈞考試作弊不服懲處，該班學生被利用起而包圍陳主任。（二）敎導主任陳煊任職以來工作動奮，（三）學生趙鳳生辦理膳食貪污，已飭覓保限期淸還，俟淸還後再處分。（四）該班學生吳立鈞考試作弊，記小過二次後不服，於辦公廳侮辱師長重記大過二次。（五）該班學生在報上發佈新聞謂師生代表於十七日謁省府敎育廳長黃撲心請願，並無事實，學生方面則指出主任陳處置不公，不接納學生要求，對貪汙膳米千餘斤之學生趙鳳生不處分而對考試作弊之學生吳立鈞則記過二次大過二次，校長平日不在校住宿，是日事發，始倉遑回校，對該班學生解釋，謂吳記過二次，係一次之誤，冀平衆憤。現學生方而堅特撤換敎導主任，　辦校長，事情尚未解決。</p>
<h3>流亡學生　在江西的動態</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>遷校一斑</p>
<p>戰爭巳是由黃河而漫延到長江，現在平漢路曁京滬地區各校仍在準備南遷，南京政大決定遷贛縣，唐山工學院巳有一百餘人，到達萍鄕，據敎育廳的消息，招待過境的戰區學生，巳有一三四〇一人，計河南學生三九四二人，山東五九〇九人，河北五〇〇人，東北三五〇人，其中轉赴湖南者爲五九〇九人，留駐贛省各縣市者八三九二人，計河南省立安陽高中三〇〇人，校址設在豐城槎市，安陽中學三五〇人，校址在　城槎市，鄭縣高農，五五〇人，校址在宜春合浦，鄭州聯中二五〇人，校址在淸江牛灣，武陟中學三〇〇人，校址在淸江永泰，中正中學二〇〇人，校址在吉安，睢陽中學一六〇人，校址在南昌市鄉東村，鄭縣分校七〇〇人，校址在吉安靑原山，河北省立第二臨中，五〇〇人，校址在臨川上頓渡，敎育部靑年輔導班三〇〇人，校址在河南省立開封女中五八〇人，校址在分宜，智强中學四〇〇人，校址在貴谿上淸宮，大梁中學二〇〇〇人，校址在鉛山，河南省立商專，四二九人，校址在高安，汲縣中學三〇〇人，校址在豐城，勵志中學巳有一部份學生到省，校址在泰和沿溪渡。</p>
<p>困難問題</p>
<p>戰區流亡學生在江西，敎廳當局最感困難的，是各校流散在各地的學生，江西敎育廳僅能盡其地主之誼負招待或設法安置的責任，各校的經費，則無權亦無法負擔，但是，有時學生沒飯吃，卻又找向敎育廳想辦法，使「周夫子」深感愛莫能助，所以他希望由戰區遷校來贛的省敎育廳應該派人在江西設機關，負責主持學生的管理與經費支撥事宜，並且在學校未遷之前，先向江西敎育廳接洽，以便酌量地方情形，解決校址分配及糧食供應等問題。</p>

<h3>President Resolutely Announces Retirement, Powers Delegated to Vice President, Hoping for Permanent Peace and Early Realization</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] President Chiang Kai-shek issued a statement on New Year's Day, advocating peace. In the past ten days, in view of the ongoing war and to influence the Communist Party and relieve the people from suffering, he issued a statement on the 21st, explaining his original intention of promoting peace and national reconstruction, and resolutely announced his retirement. He left Nanjing by special plane at 4 p.m. on the 21st. According to Article 49 of the Constitution, the presidential powers will be legally exercised by Vice President Li Zongren from the 21st.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Vice President Li Zongren, in his capacity as Acting President, will begin his duties on the 22nd. Mr. Li is scheduled to arrive at the Presidential Palace at 10 a.m. on the 22nd to assume his duties and will summon civil and military officials to give his first speech after taking office. The ceremony will be simple but solemn.</p>
<p>Full Text of the President's Statement</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] President Chiang Kai-shek issued the following statement on the 21st:</p>
<p>Since I, Chiang Kai-shek, issued a statement on New Year's Day advocating peace, the whole country has responded in unison and supported it unanimously. However, more than ten days have passed, and the war has not yet stopped. The goal of peace cannot be achieved, and the suffering of the people is reaching its limit. Therefore, I have decided to take the lead in retiring, hoping to end the war and relieve the people from suffering. In accordance with Article 49 of the Constitution of the Republic of China, which stipulates that "when the President is unable to perform his duties due to any reason, the Vice President shall act on his behalf," Vice President Li Zongren will assume the presidential powers from the 21st of this month. I hope that the military and civilians of the whole country and governments at all levels will work together with sincerity and support Vice President Li Zongren in unison to promote lasting peace. Throughout my life, I have been engaged in the national revolution and adhered to the Three Principles of the People. Since the Northern Expedition from Guangzhou in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China until the completion of unification, I have always regarded protecting the nation, realizing democracy, and improving the people's livelihood as my duties. At the same time, I believe that only by securing peace can all political and economic improvements have a solid foundation. Therefore, for more than 20 years, I have insisted on fighting the war against Japan to the end. In addition, I have sometimes used force internally only as a last resort, and I have spared no personal sacrifice, making concessions for the sake of the country. The past is clear for all to see. If the Communist Party can realize this, cease fighting and make peace, save the people from suffering, preserve the vitality of the country, ensure the integrity of the territory and sovereignty, prevent the destruction of historical culture and social order, and ensure the people's lives and freedoms, then peace can be achieved under these principles. This is what I, Chiang Kai-shek, sincerely pray for.</p>
<p>Statement of Acting President Li</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Vice President Li Zongren issued the following statement on the 21st, in accordance with the law to exercise presidential powers:</p>
<p>President Chiang Kai-shek is concerned about the difficulties of the nation and the suffering of the people and has resolutely retired to promote the early realization of peace. In accordance with Article 49 of the Constitution of the Republic of China, Zongren will exercise the powers of the President on his behalf. I am aware of my own mediocrity and incompetence and am filled with trepidation at assuming this important task. However, Zongren has followed the President and devoted himself to the revolution for more than 20 years and knows that he has always placed the country and the people first in his dealings with others and in his own conduct. His decisions regarding his own advancement and retreat are always strict, upright, and clear. Once his mind is made up, it cannot be changed. I have received his instruction and cannot refuse the responsibility. I can only work diligently, be loyal to the country, ensure that the central government's affairs do not fall into disarray, and help the President achieve his cause of saving the country and the people. I hope that all our military and civilians will cooperate sincerely, that civil and military officials will remain in their posts, that we will unite with sincerity and work together with one heart, adhere to the policy of peace and national reconstruction, and strive for democracy and freedom. The nation and the people depend on it.</p>
<h3>President Chiang Departs Nanjing for Hangzhou; Will Fly Directly to Taiwan by Special Plane This Morning; Before Departure, Summons Standing Committee Meeting to Read Retirement Statement</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] President Chiang Kai-shek retired and left Nanjing on the 21st, taking the "Meiling" special plane to Hangzhou at 4:10 p.m. The weather in the capital on the 21st was sunny and refreshing, and the temperature was relatively high, a rare warm climate in midwinter. At about 3 p.m., dozens of cars carrying important officials suddenly rushed to the Ming Palace Airport. For a time, officials gathered. The "Meiling" plane was also ready and waiting to depart. The scheduled departure time was 4 p.m. Several important officials were sitting in the auditorium of the Air Transport Brigade waiting. At 4 p.m., two cars carrying the President's attendants drove to the front gate of the airport. The "Meiling" plane suddenly took off without allowing those who came to see him off to catch a glimpse of the President's arrival and boarding. After a while, it was learned that the special plane had flown to the Dajiaochang Airport, where the President changed planes. Only Li Zongren, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, Gu Zhutong, Chen Lifu, and Hong Lanyou met and saw him off at Dajiaochang Airport. The others were too late. The special plane took off at 4:10 p.m. Today, the President was wearing a long robe and mandarin jacket. Before leaving, he showed reluctance for this revolutionary capital at the foot of Zijin Mountain, and many of the people who came to see him off looked sad. Those who accompanied him were Yu Jishi, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Zhejiang Province Chairman Chen Yi also returned to Hangzhou on the plane. Other attendants, such as Secretary Cao Shengfen, took two other special planes.

<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] President Chiang Kai-shek hoped for the early realization of peace and clearly stated in his New Year's Day message that he would not care about his personal advancement and retreat. In the past three weeks, he has been making various preparations to hand over his powers to Vice President Li Zongren. On the evening of the 19th, when he summoned several important officials, he said that he would leave within a week. However, on the morning of the 21st, the presidents and vice presidents of the five Yuan and more than a dozen important officials received the President's invitation to a luncheon at his Huangpu Road residence at 12 noon. Those present were Li Zongren, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Tong Guanxian, Liu Jianqun, Yu Youren, Liu Zhe, Wang Chonghui, Jia Jingde, Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, Zhang Qun, and Chen Lifu. The President immediately announced his intention. At 2 p.m., he convened a temporary meeting of the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee at his residence. As the President and concurrently Director-General, he read his retirement statement and repeatedly said: "My departure may be beneficial to the country." He then instructed that after his retirement, the important task of national affairs should be entrusted to Vice President Li and hoped that all parties would assist Vice President Li in completing the task. After the President explained his intention, everyone present was saddened. The country was in such a state that the President had to take the lead in retiring. Almost no one spoke at the meeting. After the meeting, the President announced that he would leave Nanjing at 4 p.m. on the 21st.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 21st] President Chiang Kai-shek arrived at Jianqiao Airport by special plane "Meiling" from Nanjing at 6:30 p.m. on the 21st, accompanied by Zhejiang Province Chairman Chen Yi and Chiang Ching-kuo, Yu Jishi and others. Zhejiang Provincial Government Secretary-General Zhang Yanzhe and Air Force School Principal Hu Weike and others went to the airport to welcome them. President Chiang and his party then went to the city and had dinner at Lou Wai Lou. After dinner, Chen Yi returned to the provincial government residence, and the President and others returned to Jianqiao. More than 50 of his entourage who came to Hangzhou stayed at the Jianqiao Air Force Officer School, No. 49 Yingbai Road, and the Dahua Hotel. It is reported that President Chiang will fly directly to Taiwan by special plane on the morning of the 22nd and may go to South China.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Air Force Headquarters learned: The President's special plane "Meiling" landed safely at Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport at 5:40 p.m. on the 21st. Chen Cheng's No. 280 special plane, which took off from Taipei, also landed five minutes after the "Meiling" plane.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Taipei, 21st] Chairman Chen Cheng left Taiwan by special plane "Ziqiang" of the Ministry of National Defense at 1 p.m. on the 21st to fly to Hangzhou to meet the President. Yan Jia-kan, Director of the Taiwan Finance Department, accompanied him.</p>

<h3>President of the Legislative Yuan Cables Provinces and Cities, Hoping for Adherence to Posts, Defense of the Nation, and Realization of Peace; Cabinet Resignation Earnestly Retained</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Sun Ke cabinet, appointed by President Chiang Kai-shek, submitted a general resignation to Acting President Li on the evening of the 21st. This move was made because President Chiang retired and left Nanjing, and his powers were exercised by Vice President Li. The current cabinet is a responsible cabinet and is related to the issue of trust, so this decision was made. However, before new candidates are nominated, they will continue to be responsible. On the afternoon of the 21st, all cabinet members saw President Chiang off at the airport. After returning to the Executive Yuan, they held a temporary administrative meeting. At the meeting, President Sun Ke first reported on President Chiang's departure from Nanjing, followed by a discussion on the general resignation of the Executive Yuan. Some members believed that the general resignation was in accordance with the law, but given the current extraordinary situation, in order to stabilize social order and people's hearts, they should also express that they would continue to be responsible before the new cabinet nominees of Acting President Li were proposed. This was subsequently agreed upon by a majority of the people. In addition, some people believed that if any cabinet member expressed the need to resign immediately, it could be considered separately. It was unanimously passed immediately and it was decided to notify all provincial and municipal governments to continue to be responsible before the new cabinet nominees were proposed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke sent a telegram to the provincial and municipal governments, pacification commissioners' offices, and general headquarters, hoping that they would adhere to their posts and be loyal. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>To the provincial and municipal governments, pacification commissioners' offices, and general headquarters, it is known that President Chiang Kai-shek, in order to respect the wishes of the people of the whole country, seek the early realization of peace, relieve the suffering of the people, and protect the vitality of the country, has handed over the presidential powers to Vice President Li in accordance with the Constitution on the 21st of this month. I and others were ordered to form a cabinet and should be responsible to the President and the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the law. Therefore, we have decided to jointly request resignation and have been ordered to uphold righteousness and earnestly retained. At this time of national crisis and widespread hardship, how dare we not exhaust our efforts and drive forward. We hope that all levels of government, all military and civilians, will uphold the great benevolence and courage of President Chiang Kai-shek, the utmost concern for the country and the people, adhere to their posts, and be loyal, defend the nation, realize peace, establish the country on a solid foundation, and bring the people to a comfortable life. There is great hope for this. Executive Yuan President Sun Ke, stamped on the 21st of January.</p>

<h3>Candidates for Negotiating Peace; Likely to be Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and Wu Zhongxin; Communist Spokesperson Criticizes Executive Yuan's Resolution on Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Taibao, Nanjing, 21st] Observers here believe that President Chiang's resolute retirement to promote peace will lead to a decisive development in the political situation in the future. Vice President Li's exercise of presidential powers will begin on the 22nd. The general resignation of the Sun Ke cabinet is unlikely to be accepted by Mr. Li, and Mr. Sun is likely to continue to be responsible in order to cooperate with Acting President Li. With the inspiration of President Chiang's retirement, peace will be realized quickly. However, one or two cabinet members in the Sun cabinet may be slightly changed. If so, Huang Shaohong, who was rumored to be joining the cabinet when Sun Ke formed the cabinet but did not, may join the Executive Yuan and serve as the head of a certain ministry. The other cabinet members are unlikely to undergo major changes. As for the issue of ceasefire and peace talks with the Communist Party, Sun Ke will make a decision within his responsibilities. It is rumored that Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and Wu Zhongxin have been ordered on the 22nd to negotiate with the Communist Party, but this has not been confirmed by relevant parties. However, it is believed that these four are the most suitable candidates for negotiations with the Communist Party. Regarding the Communist Party's broadcast opinion that the Executive Yuan's resolution on the 19th must be canceled before negotiations can be held, this is the biggest obstacle to Sun Ke's peace talks. However, this matter is expected to be mitigated by directly sending representatives for negotiations. If Mr. Sun insists on the decision to negotiate after a ceasefire, then the realization of peace will obviously still have some setbacks.</p>
<p>Original Text of the Communist Spokesperson's Remarks</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Since President Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's Day message was issued, the door to peace has been opened. The Executive Yuan's ceasefire resolution on January 19 was a further expression of the peace talks, which is obvious to all. According to the Xinhua News Agency broadcast on the evening of the 21st, the Communist spokesperson believes that the Executive Yuan's decision that the two sides should first cease fire "has closed the door to peace from now on." This shows that the Communist Party must first negotiate conditions and then cease fire and talk about peace. The following is the original text of the Xinhua News Agency broadcast.</p>
<p>"The official news agency of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government, the Central News Agency, reported on the 19th that at 9 a.m. on the 19th, the Executive Yuan meeting extensively discussed the situation and resolved as follows: "In order to follow the wishes of the people of the whole country and seek the early realization of peace, the government hereby expresses its sincere willingness to immediately and unconditionally cease fire with the Chinese Communist Party and appoint representatives to conduct peace talks." (The Chinese Communist Party spokesperson said: The Nanjing Executive Yuan's resolution did not mention the peace negotiation proposal suggested by Nanjing pseudo-President Chiang Kai-shek on January 1, nor did it mention the peace negotiation proposal suggested by Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong on January 14. It did not indicate which of these two suggestions it supports or opposes. It seems as if the Kuomintang and the Communist Party did not make any suggestions on January 1 and January 14. Instead, it put forward its own suggestions, which is completely incomprehensible. In fact, the Nanjing Executive Yuan not only completely ignored the CCP's proposal on January 14, but also directly overturned the pseudo-President Chiang Kai-shek's proposal on January 1.

<h3>Huai River Battle Situation Tense Again; More Than 100,000 Communist Troops Advance Southward in Different Directions; Troops in Gaoyou and Hongze Lakes Actively Cross the Huai River</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Chuxian, 21st] The Huai River battle situation, which has been silent for more than ten days, is now becoming tense again. Intelligence that more than 100,000 Communist troops are advancing south toward Bengbu and Fengtai from the Xusu section of the Jinpu Railway and the Hao (County) Meng (City) Highway was officially confirmed this morning. At the same time, the local Communist forces on both sides of the Ming (Guang) Pu (Kou) section of the Jinpu Railway and the Huainan Railway are also becoming active. The military believes that the Communist troops seem to be taking advantage of the government's advocacy of peace talks to send large armies south across the Huai River in an attempt to advance directly into the Yangtze River, so as to create a more favorable situation and strive for a more favorable position for the Communist Party. Li Bingtuan Commander Yan Nian is still stationed in Chuxian, while Liu Bingguo Commander Ruming has moved to Wuhu. [Another telegram] The Communist troops led by Chen Geng and Kong Congzhou have been concentrating from Zhumadian in central Henan to the periphery of Xinyang for days, and seem to be launching an offensive against central China.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Communist troops in the Gaoyou and Hongze Lakes are actively crossing the Huai River southward. On the 20th and 21st, aerial reconnaissance showed that 40 Communist ships were crossing the river in Shuanggou, 200 ships were transporting Communist troops in Jiangba, 10 ships were in Huaiyangju, 1,000 civilians were building pontoon bridges for the Communist troops in Wuhe, 80 ships were transporting Communist troops in Changhuaiwei, and 1,000 tons of ships and 20 steamships were transporting large numbers of Communist troops in Bengbu to Huaiyuan. It is reported that those who entered Bengbu were the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 9th columns of Liu Bocheng's troops, and they entered Tianjiadian, Jiulonggang, and the Huainan coal mining area. About 8,000 Communist troops are currently moving south at will. If the southward movement continues according to the calculated time, they may be facing the 99th Army troops defending Mingguang across the trenches in three days.</p>

<h3>The Northern Peace Negotiations Tend Towards Clarity Again. Xu Yongchang Flew to Beiping Yesterday and Returned to Nanjing on the Same Day, Conveying the President's Intention to Retire and Hoping That Fu Zuoyi Would Continue to be Responsible.</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang flew to Beiping by special plane on the morning of the 21st to meet with Fu Zuoyi, conveying President Chiang's intention to retire and hoping that he would continue to be responsible for the overall situation in North China. After completing his mission, he returned to Nanjing that evening.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] The "Beiping Daily" today carried a statement from an authoritative source saying: The date for the arrival of a local peace in the North is getting closer, but they are unwilling to specify the exact date of the arrival of peace. It is said that peace efforts are continuing and have already achieved decisive results, but it is not yet time for an announcement. However, one morning, the bells of peace will be heard.

<p>[Associated Press Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] The Beiping military authorities on the 21st ordered a halt to the demolition of buildings in the suburbs, and also ended restrictions on Beiping residents entering and leaving the city gates.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The President's Sincerity in Seeking Peace</h3>
<p>The President issued a statement yesterday, stating that because the New Year's Day appeal for peace has not yet been realized, the war has not yet ceased, the purpose of suppressing the rebellion is difficult to achieve, and the hope for peace remains dim. Therefore, in accordance with the Constitution, he has entrusted Vice President Li with the authority to act on his behalf, continuing to seek peace quickly to save the people from suffering. The President himself also flew from the capital yesterday to take a short rest in Zhejiang, demonstrating his sincerity in seeking peace.</p>
<p>Since the President's New Year's Day declaration that as long as peace can be achieved, his personal advancement or retreat will not be a concern, the door to peace has been widely opened. Unfortunately, the broadcast by Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party was still hostile, filled with the smell of gunpowder, and the hope for peace remained precarious. Fortunately, the Executive Yuan has a resolution that both sides should immediately cease fire and send representatives to negotiate, which was subsequently endorsed by the Central Political Committee of the Kuomintang. Whether the entire country can cease fire and make peace now depends entirely on the CCP's response. Yesterday, the President resolutely handed over his duties to Vice President Li, which was also approved by the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang, further demonstrating that the Kuomintang and the central authorities deeply understand the suffering of the people of the entire country and will spare no effort to impress the Communist Party in the hope that the god of peace can truly descend upon China.</p>
<p>If the CCP members can still remember that they are also Chinese people, can still abide by their promise to "liberate" the people, and can still consider their broadcast of "quickly ending the war," they should immediately rein in their horses, agree to a cease-fire, and negotiate sincerely to complete the great task of peace, fulfilling the people's expectations.</p>
<p>Here, standing from the perspective of the people, we must deeply recognize and wish to inform the acting president and government officials that the president's sincerity in seeking peace is originally for the sake of the people, and the price that the people are willing to pay for peace has its own boundaries that must be adhered to. In short, we cannot sacrifice the country's independence and integrity in order to seek peace, we cannot abandon the country's democratic constitutional system in order to seek peace, we cannot sacrifice the people's freedom in order to seek peace, and we cannot even sacrifice the people's livelihood and ensure their living standards in order to seek peace. Therefore, seeking peace is acceptable, sacrificing oneself for peace is acceptable, sacrificing the people for peace is unacceptable, and pleasing the Communist Party by placing the country within an authoritarian "iron curtain" is unacceptable. President Truman of the United States said well at his inauguration the day before yesterday: "Peace cannot be achieved by pleasing the Communist Party, but only by strengthening the economic, military, and social strength of free countries." I sincerely hope that government officials will carefully consider these words while striving for peace!</p>
<h3>The Safe Withdrawal from Baitanggu Was Completed. Hou Jingru Flew to the Capital. The 17th Army Corps Decided to Transfer and Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line.</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] General Hou Jingru, commander of the 17th Army Corps, who had firmly defended Tanggu, arrived in Qingdao by ship on the 20th after completing the safe withdrawal on orders. At 12:30 noon on the 21st, he arrived in Beijing by the same plane as Liu Anqi. On the 21st, he successively met with Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong and others. On the 22nd, he will continue to visit various military and political leaders. After the 17th Army Corps under his command safely withdrew from Tanggu on the 16th, a part of it has arrived in Qingdao, and the rest are still on ships en route to Qingdao. It is heard that in order to strengthen the defense of the Nanjing-Shanghai line, the authorities have decided to transfer the 17th Army Corps to Shanghai and the Nanjing-Shanghai line. Hou himself will also be transferred to the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters to take up a certain important position. However, when Hou met with reporters on the evening of the 21st, he did not affirm or acknowledge the above news, only saying that it has not yet been decided. According to Hou's words to reporters, this withdrawal from Tanggu was completed within a few hours after receiving the order. The losses of the National Army were less than a battalion. All ammunition, supplies, grain, and horses were safely transported out. In addition to the protection and transportation provided by the powerful naval fleet, more than 100 large and small ships were mobilized. Currently, our powerful naval fleet is still patrolling and monitoring the actions of the bandit army in the Bohai Sea and can land at any time. Hou also said that during this withdrawal, the Tanggu New Port project was not damaged, and Tanggu remained intact as before, in order to preserve the country's construction.</p>
<h3>Liu Anqi Arrived in Nanjing from Qingdao</h3>
<p>Visiting Gu Zhutong, Guo Chan, and Others</p>
<p>According to Reports, Qingdao Is Peaceful as Always</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] Liu Anqi, commander of the 11th Pacification Zone, flew from Qingdao to Nanjing at 12:30 noon on the 21st. After a short rest after disembarking from the plane, he went to visit Chief of Staff Gu and Logistics Commander-in-Chief Guo Chan, Deputy Minister Lin Wei, and others at 3:00 pm. At 4:00 pm, he went to the official residence on Huangpu Road to pay his respects to the President. By a few minutes, the President had already left the official residence by car to the airport to fly to Hangzhou. Liu will visit Guo Chan again on the morning of the 22nd to discuss supply issues. If time permits, he will fly back to Qingdao on the afternoon of the 22nd. According to Liu's words to reporters, Qingdao is now peaceful as always. After the last National Army attack to recover Jiaoxian, the Communist forces have not been able to retake it. Currently, there are only more than 30,000 regular troops and guerrillas of the bandit army around Qingdao. The National Army has a strong force, and if the bandits come to attack, they will definitely not succeed. Liu denied the rumors that the US military had withdrawn, but said that it was true that part of the US military had boarded warships. As for whether they will withdraw in the future, it depends on the US's national policy. Finally, Liu also said that regardless of whether the US military withdraws in the future, the National Army will never abandon Qingdao.</p>

He continued that Canada had not made formal contact with the Communist army, but "several other countries" had informal contact with the Communist Party.</p>

<h3>The Xinjiang Provincial Government Meeting Approves the Draft of This Year's Policy Guidelines.</h3>

This draft follows the four major policies of peace, unification, democracy, and unity proclaimed by Director Zhang, is based on the content revealed in the policy guidelines, and adapts to the current people's aspirations. It centers on stabilizing the rear, strengthening unity, enhancing Sino-Soviet friendship, promoting national culture, improving people's lives, rectifying officialdom, and improving administrative efficiency. It is formulated by measuring the current time, place, and environmental conditions. It is divided into six items: politics, economy, finance, education, culture, and health. Secretary-General Liu Mengchun emphasized at the meeting that this draft contains revolutionary significance, because under the foundation of establishing a democratic political system, it is necessary to allow the true people to be the masters, and the representatives and officials produced by popular elections should implement according to public opinion. However, the representatives of public opinion produced in this province in the past did not represent public opinion, but were local tyrants and evil gentry who raped public opinion, turning public opinion and the rule of law into tools to protect evil forces. Therefore, the provincial government should now lead a social revolution to thoroughly implement democratic politics.</p>

<h3>Spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party Speaks (Continued from page 2)</h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek said in his New Year's Day address: "As long as the Communist Party has the sincerity for peace and can make a definite expression, the government will sincerely meet with them and is willing to discuss concrete methods to stop the war and restore peace." Nineteen days later, a part of the same government, namely the "Executive Yuan" of the Nanjing government, overturned the statement of the "President" of this government, not "sincerely meeting with them and being willing to discuss concrete methods to stop the war and restore peace," but "immediately first unconditionally cease fire and each designate representatives to conduct peace talks." We want to ask the gentlemen of the Nanjing "Executive Yuan," which of your suggestions is effective? Or is your "President's" suggestion effective? Your "President" considers "stopping the war and restoring peace" as one thing, declaring that he will sincerely meet with the CCP and is willing to discuss concrete methods to achieve this thing. You, on the other hand, separate war and peace into two things, unwilling to send representatives to discuss concrete methods with us to stop the war, but instead fantasize about first "unconditionally ceasing fire" and then sending representatives to "conduct peace talks." Which of your suggestions is correct? Or is your "President's" suggestion correct? We believe that the puppet Executive Yuan has exceeded its authority. It is not qualified to overturn the suggestion of the puppet President and even make new suggestions. We believe that this new suggestion of the Nanjing "Executive Yuan" is unreasonable. After fighting such a long, large, and cruel war, both sides should send people to discuss a basic ceasefire agreement before the war can subside. Not only do the people have this hope, but many people on the Kuomintang side have also expressed this hope. If, according to the Nanjing "Executive Yuan's" unreasonable resolution, it is unwilling to hold peace talks without first ceasing fire, then where is the Nationalists' sincerity for peace? The Nanjing "Executive Yuan's" resolution has been made, and there is no possibility of peace talks without first ceasing fire. The door to peace is closed from now on. And if you want to negotiate, you must either cancel this unreasonable resolution, or one of the two must be chosen. If the Nanjing "Executive Yuan" is unwilling to cancel its so-called resolution, then it shows that the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government has no sincerity in conducting peace talks with its counterpart. People want to ask, "If the Nanjing side has sincerity," why are they unwilling to discuss the conditions for peace? The Nanjing peace suggestion is false. Isn't such a conclusion already proven? Nanjing is now in a state of anarchy. The puppet President has one suggestion, and the puppet Executive Yuan has one suggestion. Who should people deal with?"</p>
<h3>The Chinese Communist Party Implies That It Requires Participation in the Occupation of Japan</h3>

After the new China itself gains freedom, it will strictly abide by the Potsdam Declaration, assist in the democratization of Japan, and prevent the revival of reactionary forces. Japan will be able to conclude a treaty with the Chinese people in the future and establish political and economic relations. The Chinese people hope to establish friendly relations with the Japanese people without any doubt."</p>

<h3>Asian Conference to Urge Security Council to Quickly Resolve the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute; Four-Nation Committee to Draft Proposals</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 21st] The nineteen Asian nations attending the New Delhi conference held a closed-door meeting on the 21st. Once again, they failed to reach an agreement on the establishment of a permanent group of Far Eastern countries to safeguard all rights. The conference decided that the drafting committee would determine the wording of the resolution, requesting "the Security Council to take countermeasures to promote a swift and satisfactory resolution."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 20th] Following a closed-door meeting this evening, the Asian conference elected Australia, India, Ceylon, and Pakistan to form a four-nation committee to draft a final proposal to be submitted to the Security Council. This proposal will include all points discussed in the closed-door meeting earlier tonight. It is understood that the nineteen participating representatives and observers completed a general discussion of the proposals made by each representative at this morning's open meeting. The various proposals will be summarized in one proposal. Representatives from New Zealand and Abyssinia only arrived tonight and were therefore unable to attend this morning's open meeting.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] The Indian Ministry of External Affairs issued a public statement tonight stating that the Asian conference discussed the following five points in its closed-door meeting tonight: (1) Restoration of the Indonesian Republic government's complete freedom of action; (2) Return of the territory held by the Indonesian Republic government on December 18 to that government, with Dutch forces withdrawing from that area; (3) Establishment of a provisional government; (4) Election of a constituent assembly to transfer power to the United States of Indonesia; (5) Formation of a committee or other body by the Security Council, granted appropriate authority, to implement the above-mentioned recommendations. The above points will be listed in the proposal submitted by the four-nation drafting committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 20th] Asian countries held a closed-door meeting at Hyderabad House on the 20th, resolving to request the Security Council to order the completion of Indonesian independence before the end of this year. The meeting also agreed to recommend to the Security Council that it order Dutch forces to immediately withdraw to the lines of December 18, with this withdrawal to be completed before March 15. Asian countries will also request the Security Council to guarantee the re-establishment of a reorganized provisional Indonesian government before March 18, but the meeting did not stipulate the date for convening the Indonesian constituent assembly. However, most representatives believe that this assembly should be held in mid-October so that the transfer of power to the republic can be completed before the end of the year. The issue of sanctions against the Netherlands will be discussed on the 21st, and its passage is expected to be beyond doubt. The Asian conference will discuss on the 22nd whether the current conference will become a permanent organization, and a widespread breakdown is anticipated on this matter.</p>
<h3>Four Nations Submit Proposal to the Security Council to Intensify Intervention in the Indonesian Situation; Aim to Achieve Indonesian Independence by the End of June Next Year</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] New York, 21st Broadcast: Lake Success report: China, the United States, Norway, Cuba, and other countries jointly submitted a proposal to the Security Council today, advocating the rapid intensification of intervention in the Indonesian situation, with the aim of achieving independence for all of Indonesia before July 1, 1950.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 20th] The four-nation proposal for resolving the Dutch-Indonesian dispute is reported to have been completed tonight after nearly a week of active discussion by the Security Council representatives. Informed sources say that the United Kingdom has also expressed its agreement. It seems unlikely that the proposal will not pass around the 21st. The proponents are the United States, China, Norway, and Cuba, with Canada and Egypt expressing support. Adding the United Kingdom, this would make up the statutory majority of seven votes, but none of the five major powers can exercise their veto.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] The U.S. amendment to the Dutch-Indonesian issue proposes that the Security Council establish a committee to handle the Indonesian situation, suggesting methods for withdrawing Dutch troops, but without the authority to issue orders. This differs from the original U.S. plan. In addition, it requests a ceasefire between the Dutch and Indonesians, the release of imprisoned Indonesian political leaders, and the establishment of an Indonesian federation by July 1 next year.</p>
<h3>Dutch Prime Minister Beel Has Returned to The Hague</h3>
<p>Negotiations with Indonesia Have Not Yet Reached an Agreement</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 20th] Dutch Prime Minister Beel departed for The Hague today after a two-week inspection tour of the East Indies. It is said that the meetings between Dutch and Indonesian leaders over the past two weeks have taken several positive steps. First, the Netherlands has provided positive promises regarding the organization of a provisional government for the Indonesian Federation. Second, the Dutch and Indonesian sides have made further contact and created an atmosphere that allows all parties involved to conduct new consultations. The main objectives of the recent negotiations are threefold: (1) to quickly organize a provisional government for the Indonesian Federation; (2) to quickly prepare for the organization of an independent Indonesian Federation so that it can accept sovereignty from the Netherlands; (3) to hold free elections. If international concern over the issue of organizing the Indonesian Federation government is slightly reduced, the negotiations will be more effective. I have negotiated with former Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Sjahrir, and both sides have been frank and strived for cooperation. Whether the Dutch can reach a final agreement with the leaders of the Indonesian Republic remains to be reviewed by the Indonesian side.</p>
<h3>Truman Asks Congressmen to Support New Economic Aid Plan to Develop Backward Countries with Science and Technology</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Washington, 21st Broadcast: President Truman recently told congressmen from Missouri that he deeply hopes that congressmen can cooperate with him to seek world peace. The President stated that if the United States can improve the economic situation of other countries, war can be avoided. For example, if the purchasing power of Asian countries can increase slightly, the United States will be greatly prosperous.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] Truman's bold new plan to build up backward areas of the world may be another major step in U.S. foreign policy, comparable to the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. The Truman's new plan is an international cooperation plan to develop backward areas with the advanced science and technology of the United States and other countries.</p>
<p>Truman declared that the United States "must undertake" this plan. World Bank President McCloy said that the President's plan was clearly conceived from "the written suggestions I recently presented to him." McCloy said that U.S. science and technology can be used globally without harming the United States, and the new economic plan can be "properly" implemented by the World Bank and the U.S. Export-Import Bank.</p>
<h3>Asian Countries Express Concern</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New Delhi, 21st] President Truman's inaugural address, advocating that the world use specialized technologies to promote human life, has today aroused concern at the Asian conference here. According to New Zealand representative Groggs, the world can be improved if scientific and technological knowledge can be fully utilized. Science is by no means the private property of any country or nation, but should be made public to the world. At the same time, Egyptian representative Kamel Bey also stated that his views are the same as those expressed by Indian Prime Minister Nehru the other day, that is, the basic goal of science must be to use its inventions to raise the living standards of all mankind.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The new U.S. Secretary of State Acheson has assumed office today and will implement Truman's four anti-communist foreign policies after being re-elected as president. His main task is to first encourage people to invest in foreign countries. The United States' foreign economic policy has almost reached a turning point. Although plans such as European recovery will proceed according to the planned steps, officials expect that from now on, emphasis will be placed on utilizing private capital and reducing direct government funding. There are currently three major issues that need to be addressed: completing the drafting of the North Atlantic Mutual Defense Treaty, implementing the comprehensive foreign aid bill, and drafting a detailed plan to fulfill the President's promise to increase production in backward areas of the world and thereby raise their living standards. The United States may send a large number of scientists and technicians abroad to investigate local conditions in order to determine how to assist in development.</p>
<h3>Good Response From All Sides to Truman's Speech</h3>

They particularly welcome the speech's emphasis on uniting Western European democracies through economic assistance and the need to place Western European countries under the protection of the Atlantic Pact. They are very interested in the suggestion of Truman's "bold new program," namely, assisting underdeveloped areas. Diplomatic circles believe that the generosity and proactiveness in this speech are similar to some of Roosevelt's speeches.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Rhodes, 20th] Representatives from Egypt and Israel disagree over the Nitzanim border area. A spokesman for the UN mediation team said that the negotiating parties have compromised on some points, but hinted that opinions on other important points are still divided.</p>
<h3>Pan Yuqin Remains Silent</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Pan Yuqin sat less than twenty feet from Truman on the twentieth, while Truman denounced communism as "hypocrisy," and his attitude was calm. He sat in the diplomatic corps seat, and although he seemed to listen to Truman's speech, there was absolutely no emotional expression on Pan's face when Truman denounced communism. When asked what he thought of the speech, Pan replied that he had no opinion.</p>

<h3>Four Firms Collapse Due to Failed Speculation Amidst Economic Turmoil, Affecting Three or Four Correspondent Banks</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In recent days, the market has fluctuated greatly, rising and falling sharply. There have been quite a few firms engaged in speculation that have suffered losses in this economic turmoil. Yesterday, four firms in this city collapsed because of this.

<p>The China Licao General Assembly issued a letter to compatriots across the country yesterday to promote peace, saying: "Since President Chiang's New Year's Day message was published, the peace that the people of the whole country have been expecting has revealed a dawn. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, also announced his intention for peace a few days ago. Although the peace negotiation terms are far apart, the opening of the door to peace is a fact. Whether peace can be achieved in the future, we hope that both sides will prioritize the country and the people, and sincerely make concessions to each other to realize a new China of peace, democracy, freedom, strength, prosperity, happiness. Since the founding of the Republic of China, there has been no peaceful year, and the suffering of the people has reached its extreme, especially after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, followed by three years of war. The vitality of the country has been greatly damaged, and its vitality is about to end. The people's desperate hope for peace is like expecting clouds in a severe drought. Now that peace is in sight, we are willing for the people of the country to seek to win it together. Our 18 million Licao members across the country vow to be the backing, in order to lay the foundation for the country's peace as soon as possible, and the people can enjoy the blessings of recovery, the river is clear and the sea is calm, and they can enjoy prosperity together. I urge compatriots across the country to rise up and plan for it together."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables to Yuanbu Requesting Expediting Mail Service in Retreated Areas</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan Ministry of Transportation yesterday, requesting that mail services be properly planned as soon as possible within the possible scope in the retreated areas to facilitate the industrial and commercial year-end settlement and as a prelude to peace. The original telegram said: "Nanjing Executive Yuan Ministry of Transportation Junjian, Since recent years, the war zone has expanded day by day. Whenever an area is retreated, the post office immediately suspends mail service. Therefore, people in both places and industries and commerce in both places, once interrupted by military affairs, want to send letters, just like being separated by generations. Compared with residing in foreign countries, there is still the convenience of international mail service. It is also very different. People have been looking up to it for a long time, but they have not dared to report it lightly because of the busy military affairs and strict government orders. Now that the central government has taken into account the difficulties of the people and opened up a path to peace, and also when major cities have abandoned their guards one after another, the areas mentioned above have close industrial and commercial relations with Shanghai. At the end of the year, there are many things that need to be settled and negotiated between the commercial sectors in the two places. If mail service is still blocked, industry and commerce will have the suffering of suffocation. I must have compassion for these difficulties. It is proposed to properly plan the mail service method within the current possible scope and implement it as soon as possible, as a prelude to the period when peace is still being brewed, so that merchants and people can have a new experience and see the determination of the central government to rescue them from drowning. I am so grateful."</p>

<h3>Debate Concluded in Deng Zhonghe's Defamation Case; Verdict to Be Announced on the 26th; Defendant Filed Three Counterclaims Yesterday</h3>

After an hour of trial, the debate was concluded, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced at 4:00 PM on the 26th of this month.</p>
<p>Chen Zhen and Zhu Yakui, the defending lawyers of the plaintiff Zhu Zhengwen, stated that Zhu was unable to attend court due to illness. They represented the plaintiff, stating that although the plaintiff's accusation against the defendant as a traitor had been dismissed by the Zhejiang Higher Procuratorate, it was decided to apply to the Supreme Court for reconsideration. Since the case was related to the current case, they requested the court to postpone the trial. The court stated that the case had been delayed for a long time and could not wait any longer, and the trial proceeded as usual. Deng Zhonghe stated that the accusation that he colluded with the enemy during the occupation was completely fabricated, and he was threatened and extorted by Zhu, so he sent a telegram calling Zhu a "threatening bandit," which was entirely a passive self-defense. He presented the Zhejiang Higher Procuratorate's decision not to prosecute him for treason in court and filed three counterclaims: (1) Zhu invited reporters in late August last year to publish documents falsely claiming that he had rented the Anle Textile Factory to a Japanese yarn factory as employee dormitories. (2) He forged official documents from the Military Affairs Commission to threaten him. (3) He forged letters from Wanlilang to falsely accuse him of being a traitor.

<h3>Shenbao Education Aid Campaign Adds Special Grants</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's "Reader Education Aid Fund" has decided to add various "special grants" to meet the needs of reality. If private individuals, groups, manufacturers, firms, and fellow-provincial associations, trade associations, etc., donate funds to help poor students, this newspaper will accept the wishes of the donors and handle all publicity, application, review, and distribution procedures, and the donors can specify their name.</p>
<p>For example, if a certain fellow-provincial association sees that many young people from the same province are out of school and wants to launch an education aid campaign, the target of assistance will be limited to young people from the same province. For another example, if a certain gentleman wants to commemorate his ancestors or sympathize with the suffering of young people out of school and donate funds to start an education aid fund, he can specify a name for commemoration.</p>
<p>For these special donations, we will do our best to assist with the same spirit of education aid as in the past and handle them on behalf of the donors. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, it would naturally be the most meaningful good deed if enthusiastic readers would donate their savings to help students. We have been appealing for several days, and donations are not as satisfactory as we had hoped, but we have 12 points of confidence in future achievements. Finally, we hope that enthusiastic readers can give us continuous support and encouragement.</p>

<h3>Three Overcoats and a Gun: Knowing His Brother Was No Good, a Rascal Threatened His Sister and Was Reported, Leading to His Arrest</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] As the lunar year draws to a close, bandits are stirring and robberies are occurring frequently. Within the Nanshi district, there are often groups of thugs engaging in so-called "forced entry and removal" activities. Peng Rongfa, the deputy captain of the police, and his wife, Ms. Xu, reside at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Lujiabang Road. Peng's younger brother-in-law, Xu Yonglin, nicknamed "Head Chopper Ghost," is a rascal. On the evening of the 19th, at 9 p.m., while his brother-in-law was out, Yonglin barged into their home with a pistol in hand, threatening his sister. Fortunately, Ms. Xu was quick-witted and managed to escape and report the incident to the Penglai Branch Bureau. Section Chief Li ordered officers Lu Jihong, Zhao Chunpu, Li Fengyong, officers Li Xianwen, Bian Xicheng, and Chen Hailin to make an arrest, but he had already fled. It wasn't until around 1 a.m. the next morning that Xu Yonglin and his accomplice Yu Fuchang (nicknamed "Little Fuchang") were apprehended in a shantytown near Datongmen. A holster was found on Yu, and they were taken to the bureau for questioning, but both vehemently denied any illegal activities. However, investigations revealed that the two had a history of committing multiple thefts.</p>
<p>Xu also has an older sister named Fengying, who lives at a certain number on Gujiating, Lujiabang Road. Yesterday, she discovered a revolver and five bullets under her bed, which greatly surprised her. At the same time, Xu's older brother, Qilin, arrived and, after discussing the matter, both felt uneasy. Two months ago, Yonglin had borrowed 300 Gold Yuan from his older brother, which he never repaid. After several requests for repayment, Yonglin brought three men's and women's overcoats to settle the debt: a beige wool women's overcoat, a dark blue hai hu rong women's overcoat, and a silk men's overcoat. Fengying and Qilin knew their brother's bad character. After discussing it, and fearing being implicated, the siblings sent the revolver and overcoats to the Penglai Police Branch Bureau. Officers compared the holster with Yu Fuchang's and found that it matched, leading them to conclude that the gun belonged to Yonglin. As a precaution, the two suspects were detained and rigorously interrogated about other crimes they had committed. It is reported that two other accomplices of the two suspects have been arrested by the Songshan Branch Bureau and are also under investigation.</p>

<h3>Easy Credit, Strong Buying Interest: Rice Prices Rise Again; Flour Fluctuates Slightly, Edible Oil Continues to Increase</h3>
<p>The rice market rose yesterday because other commodity prices had increased significantly on the previous day, while rice prices had fallen. Therefore, people expected prices to rise, and sellers made every effort to hold up prices. In addition, loose credit increased buying interest. In the North Market, white geng rice was priced at 1,670 yuan, an increase of 120 yuan; thin indica rice rose 70 yuan; early indica rice also rose to 1,550 yuan; xian rice rose 100 yuan, and both varieties of face white rice rose 50 yuan. In the South Market, prices initially rose by 50 to 60 yuan, but later, due to strong buying interest, prices rose again.

Mung beans were firm, and adzuki beans rose sharply.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Continued to rise, with soybean oil and raw oil rising the most. Prices rose 500 yuan at the opening yesterday.

<p>Yesterday morning, the city's credit situation became even looser. Interest rates in various markets fell again, averaging 45 yuan. The silk market had particularly loose funds, with rates only around 40 yuan, while the cotton market had higher rates, around 50 yuan, due to stronger trading activity. The interest rates for the National Bank's rediscounting and daily lending remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Special Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit: Initial Issuance to Cover Forced Acquisition Portion</h3>
<p>The Central Bank is still expediting the preparation and issuance of special foreign currency certificates of deposit.

It is understood that the National Bank still intends to first issue the portion covering forced acquisitions, which can be used in three quarterly installments, starting from the eighth quarter and ending in the tenth quarter. It is heard that the amount is extremely small, only several thousand U.S. dollars. The second batch will be the priority purchase portion.</p>
<h3>Increase in Floating Capital in the Market: Estimated to Reach Over One Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, remittances from inland China to Shanghai have increased again, and credit is loosening, causing speculation to stir again. People are successively absorbing materials into the market. It is estimated that the floating capital gathered in the market has increased to over one billion yuan. Although the China Textile Corporation and the China Industrial and Mining Corporation continue to sell materials, it is still insufficient to meet the demand, causing prices to rise again.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Purchases Textile Products for 150 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Cotton textile companies need a large amount of cash to distribute year-end bonuses to workers and have jointly requested the Central Bank to purchase finished cotton yarn products. Yesterday morning, representatives from the textile industry in six districts visited the Central Bank to discuss the purchase. Li Lixia received them and decided that the Central Bank would make the purchases immediately. The price calculation method would be based on the cost of each finished product plus processing and discounts. Therefore, the actual amount purchased per item would be lower or higher than the current market price. The total purchase amount is 150 million yuan. It is heard that the funds will be issued today.</p>
<h3>Overseas Remittances Posted Higher Yesterday, Foreign Exchange Certificates Show No Improvement</h3>

<p>Tung Oil: Rising Strongly</p>
<p>Recently, tung oil market conditions have seen only sporadic transactions because as the lunar new year draws near, most industry participants are reluctant to trade. However, since credit has gradually loosened, profits are extraordinarily high. Yesterday's market also saw edible oil prices reach a peak, causing holders of goods to become increasingly bullish, raising prices in response, resulting in a surge of more than 1,000 yuan across the board.</p>
<h3>China Textile Still Lists for Sale, Cotton Yarn Initially Rises Then Falls</h3>
<p>The trend of cotton yarn yesterday was initially high and then low. Credit within the industry was both loose and tight, but prices of other commodities generally softened. The financial black market trended sideways, and people's sentiments calmed, and the desire to buy declined.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 91,000 yuan. After the American Aid Council listed for sale again, and supply became plentiful, people's sentiments softened. Retailers turned from buyers to sellers, and prices fell slightly by 2,000 yuan. Afterwards, large accounts closed out positions, and the trend weakened further, falling all the way to a closing price of 79,000 yuan, a decrease of 7,000 yuan.</p>
<p>40-count followed, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. 32-count fell sharply by 8,000 to 9,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse initially opened with firm sentiments, and prices did not fall, with many still trying to push prices up. The initial price was 61,000 yuan, rising by 2,000 yuan in an instant. However, buying interest was weak, and people's sentiments weakened. Afterwards, the American Aid Council listed for sale, causing the market to plummet. Retailers turned from buyers to sellers, and many followed the downtrend. Prices fell straight down, closing at 51,300 yuan, a decrease of 8,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: Firm</p>
<p>Cotton cloth trended firm. Rumors of a peace agreement were spreading, and the authorities were discussing registering materials, causing sensitive parties to be wary and sell off slightly. Credit within the industry remained loose, with daily interest rates at around 45 yuan. Four Gentlemen yuan bi ji initially weakened and then strengthened, opening at 2,200 yuan, immediately falling to 2,080 yuan, and then rising to 2,190 yuan near the close.

<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company continued to sell yarn on behalf of the National Bank and the American Aid Council yesterday, listing 700 bales. Only 21 households applied to purchase, purchasing only 75 bales, with a value of 3,963,000 yuan.

<h3>Silk Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>The silk market yesterday initially rose and then softened. Initially, the price of gold was still good, floating capital was abundant, buying interest was still strong, and people's sentiments seemed quite firm, so prices opened high. Later, as the Lunar New Year approached, various industries arranged their finances, and the prices of other commodities generally softened. The foreign exchange certificates also showed no improvement, and the price of gold fell back, so people's sentiments turned weak.</p>
<p>120-count Tianqiao initially opened at 91,000 yuan, but large accounts sold off dramatically, and the market quickly softened. The morning session closed at 87,000 yuan. In the afternoon session, credit tightened slightly, and the price of gold fell again, so people's sentiments became even weaker. Many retailers continued to sell off, and the trend continued to soften, with prices continuing to fall by 200 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of foreign exchange transfer certificates for raw silk has been hovering without improvement in recent days. Foreign firms have stopped purchasing, and the silk weaving industry has reached the time for holidays and shutdowns, so actual sales are also weak and trading is quite light. Premium retail lots opened at 96,000 yuan in the morning, but no one inquired about them for half a day. The market was as still as water. The prices of yarn and cloth weakened, and people's sentiments were uncertain, so the market closed with a further decline, ending at 92,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Chouduan was initially affected by fluctuations in gold prices, and prices rose as soon as trading opened. Afterwards, the price of gold fell back, and buying interest turned weak, so prices also fell. However, because there was no way out for floating capital in the market recently, and yarn and cloth were suppressed, the focus shifted. The market softened and then strengthened, and prices generally rose at the close. Meiya bedspreads opened at 53,500 yuan, and there was a rush to push up prices on the trading floor, rising by 5,000 yuan in an instant. After the price reached a high, more people closed out positions, and the market saw selling pressure. The prices of other commodities weakened further, and people's sentiments were depressed. The morning session closed at 56,500 yuan, and prices were still weak in the afternoon session, with prices falling by another 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Initially High Then Flat</h3>
<p>The sugar market trended firm yesterday, with prices rising across the board. Credit in the market loosened, and interest rates fell back, so holders of goods were mostly waiting and watching. However, because the Lunar New Year was approaching and there were rumors of a peace agreement, the market trended initially high and then flat.</p>
<p>45-count che bai jing trended sharply higher at the opening, and people's sentiments were quite bullish. There did not seem to be much stock in the market, and merchant buying interest was keen, pushing prices towards a peak. Afterwards, the price of gold fell back, and there were many rumors, so people had many concerns, and the market trended softer after being high. In the afternoon, there was a further rise of 200 yuan to 3,600 yuan, and coarse sand also rose 200 yuan. Others such as Xingbai, red he, sea red, mian red, diaoqing, etc., all rose by about 200 yuan.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou: A Casual Discussion on Non-Defense</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Airlifted Dispatch from Hangzhou, 19th of This Month by This Newspaper] With frequent wars, major cities across the country are worried about artillery fire attacks, so they are intermittently fantasizing about becoming undefended cities. Beijing and Tianjin made public appeals some time ago, but artillery fire is merciless, and eventually they were affected.</p>
<p>Hangzhou, a world-renowned scenic spot, has recently begun to see a faint call for "non-defended city" status as the smell of gunpowder gradually approaches. The cause is this: Hangzhou City Council members, thinking about the horrors of war, had Speaker Zhang Heng voice the demand for "Hangzhou to be a non-defended city" at a meeting. At the general meeting of the City Council this month, Zhang Heng formally stated in his opening speech that he wanted to send a telegram to both sides stating, "Hangzhou is a non-defended city," and also emphasized that Hangzhou has always "opposed civil war."</p>
<p>The reporter searched the classics for the explanation of the so-called non-defended city. According to the Practical Dictionary of War: "That is, a city that has not been equipped with defensive works. According to international law, when two countries go to war, they must not bomb non-defended cities." According to Zheng Bin's International Law in Wartime, Article 117, it states: "Article 25 of the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare stipulates: No matter what means are used, it is not allowed to attack or bombard undefended areas (cities, villages, houses). This article also prohibits airplanes from bombing from the air, but what is meant by undefended areas is open to interpretation." Cai Kecheng's International Law in Extraordinary Times states: "(A) The Hague Regulations prohibit attacking undefended towns, villages, residences, or buildings by any means whatsoever. In other words, international law only allows belligerent countries to bombard defended towns, but the so-called 'defended' refers to the presence of troops, not the existence of fortresses. Also, the Hague Regulations' 'by any means whatsoever' probably includes aerial attacks by airplanes. (B) Belligerent countries can bombard the entire defended town regardless of fortresses and houses, but they must not attack undefended private houses. At the same time, efforts must be made to preserve religious, artistic, scientific, charitable, and other cultural institutions or buildings, as well as hospitals, etc., that are undefended at the time and not used for military purposes. However, these institutions and buildings must have their special marks, which can be seen from a distance, notified to the enemy army in advance."</p>
<p>Based on the above, we know that the so-called "non-defended city" originated from international wars, not from civil wars. However, in the Second World War, German and Austrian missiles bombed undefended cities in Britain and France, and Japanese planes wantonly bombed undefended cities in the rear of China, causing criticism from world public opinion. However, later, Britain and France, under the pretext of revenge, took the same actions. All of this can be said to have broken the rules of "non-defended cities."</p>
<p>During the two World Wars, the only country that was truly unaffected by the war was Switzerland, a permanently neutral country. Switzerland has scenery as beautiful as Hangzhou, numerous cultural institutions, and a very high standard of living and culture. Their universities, middle schools, and primary schools are on a scale that our country cannot match, and cultural activities are spread to every corner. The number of libraries, etc., for studying specialized knowledge is unknown. Because of this, she was able to mediate international wars and protect her own safety. However, on September 2, 1939, the second day of the German-Polish War, Switzerland had to implement military mobilization. On September 3, the day Britain and France declared war on Germany, Switzerland became even more tense. Fortunately, the German army considered this beautiful world cultural fortress and directly attacked France through the Netherlands and Belgium. Also, in the First World War, because France and Belgium had learned from the First World War, the two countries built a solid defense line in the eastern part of their territory, such as the German advance into France through Switzerland, behind the right rear of the Maginot Line. Moreover, because the right wing of the French Maginot Line was a weaker link in the eastern defense line of France, it could directly attack the rear of the second fortress line of France. Cooperating with the German army advancing from Belgium, they completed the extension and encirclement of the two wings of Paris. However, later, because they considered this beautiful world cultural fortress, they chose the difficult path and directly attacked the Netherlands, Belgium, and entered France. Therefore, we can also understand that in international affairs, Belgium is also a permanently neutral country, but Belgium could not avoid both World Wars, while Switzerland alone could turn danger into safety. What is the meaning of this? This time, the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is a domestic war. Can Hangzhou's status be applicable to international war rules and extended to the position of domestic war? This should be a question. At the same time, many preconditions for the so-called "non-defended city," can they be achieved? This is also a question. However, the reporter believes that Hangzhou is indeed a beautiful place. Unfortunately, there is very little cultural construction. If we can strengthen cultural construction, so that Hangzhou not only has a beautiful appearance but also a rich content, then the warring units will not bear to destroy this beautiful cultural fortress.</p>
<p>At this city council meeting, we will also discuss the issue of "building Hangzhou into a cultural city" that the reporter advocated. They have mentioned it twice in the opening ceremony, and we hope to quickly promote its success!</p>
<h3>Wuxi's Various Organizations Respond to Peace</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Wuxi by This Newspaper, 20th of This Month] Recently, various organizations in this county have received letters from various places in Nanjing and Shanghai, inquiring about the opinions of Wuxi people on peace. Qian Sunqing, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and Li Ti, Speaker, compiled the letters and specially invited temporary conveners of public and private organizations to a meeting yesterday to discuss the matter. After summarizing the local opinions adopted by everyone, Qian Sunqing was publicly elected to draft the document, which will be signed and issued on the 22nd. The original draft stated: The flames of war are pressing on our eyebrows, and the decision between peace and war has not been made in the court. The army is wandering, and the people are afraid. The President's New Year's Day message stated that the Three Principles of the People have not been realized, and the national crisis is even more serious, which is taken as his own fault. Moreover, the military burden on the people has been increased, and the people's suffering has been deepened. Deep consideration must be given to the people's hope for peace to be realized as soon as possible. The CCP stated that no matter what the conditions, it also advocates ending the war quickly and reducing the suffering of the people. In short, all of this can be summarized as convening a political consultation conference, and all problems can be easily solved. The public and private organizations of our Wuxi people sincerely support the President's New Year's Day message and believe that under the government's advocacy of the principle of peace, the following matters should be paid attention to and implemented in advance: (1) Abolish special criminal courts and military trials for people not related to military affairs. (2) Release political prisoners who have been arrested and all political prisoners in custody. (3) Open up legitimate public opinion and stop the arrest of political reactionaries in various places, so as to truly achieve democracy and peace.</p>
<h3>Village Talk in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Zheng Shizhu</p>
<p>[Airlifted Dispatch from Fuzhou by This Newspaper, 19th of This Month] When one flies from Nanjing or Shanghai and arrives in the airspace above Fuzhou Airport after a three-hour flight, the first thing that catches the eye are the scattered villages nearby, the crisscrossing fields, the dense forests, and the wide, quiet rivers all around.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Baonong Cooperative and the Farmers' Association, disputes between tenant farmers and landlords often occur during the harvest season. Today's landlords are mostly newly rich people. They occupy mostly between ten and thirty acres of land, and they often have a residual sense of superiority in the local area. They depend on the income from the land, and they also feel like they are barely surviving due to the restrictions of land laws, years of drought and crop failure, and heavy taxation. Therefore, every time the harvest is divided, they must argue fiercely and try their best to prevent the tenant farmers from reaching the amount stipulated in the land law. The power of the local gentry in each village varies, thus creating various temporary tacit agreements. Even honest tenant farmers have not benefited from the new law at all. The new land law will collect land exceeding 30 acres, but in the villages around these dozens of miles, there are really too few people who own more than 30 acres of land.</p>
<p>When you want to buy some agricultural by-products in the village, sometimes you will run into a snag. When you want to buy a two-jin hen, they want twenty-two jin of grain. It turns out that most of the transactions in the village are now done with grain as the medium of exchange. However, small-scale transactions still cannot do without paper money, which has become a new bimetallic system.</p>
<p>Recently, the quiet villages have added many guests from restless places. One type is veteran soldiers, who are scattered in various villages in groups of two to three hundred or dozens of people. The value of the paper money in their hands is often higher than that of ordinary people. They also often receive various unavoidable free preferential treatments. The issue of military discipline in wartime is always a headache. Another type is foreign brides who speak different languages, evacuees who are mute, or children who grew up in other places. They also instinctively learn the sign language of deaf and dumb schools.</p>
<p>During the emergency evacuation period in Nanjing and Shanghai, the houses in Fuzhou city were not enough, so the temples or large houses in the villages were also posted with evacuation organization notices. The farmers in the villages are hoping for peace to come soon, hoping that these notices will be torn off automatically soon.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Grain Officials' Malpractice: Farmers Hold Certificates to Accuse</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Jiaxing by This Newspaper, 19th of This Month] Twelve farmers, including Shen Guanshou, from the 31st Bao of Jiaxiu Town, transported rice collectively to the Tianliang Branch Office in the east of the city on the 17th to pay this year's grain tax. When it was weighed, it was found that there was a huge difference from the original weight, which aroused suspicion. After careful attention, it was discovered that the bamboo baskets for holding grain at the office had a false weight increase. Therefore, they weighed a bamboo basket with three of them and took it to the town office for evidence. At the same time, they complained to the Senate. In addition to sending personnel to investigate thoroughly, County Chief Chen said that he would transfer the case to the court for strict punishment.</p>
<h3>Yu Chao, Assistant Manager of the Bank of China's Tunxi Branch, Drug Case Partially Concluded</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Tunhan by This Newspaper, 13th of This Month] The case of Yu Chao, the manager of the Tunxi branch of the Bank of China, who smoked opium, hoarded, and embezzled, has been largely investigated and interrogated. The Xiuning District Prosecutor's Office has recently discovered new clues, which are said to be wider than before, involving dozens of suspected accomplices, and most of them are important bank officials. The Xiuning District Prosecutor's Office has issued separate documents to the courts under their jurisdiction, requesting them to investigate the case nearby. According to the case, which has occurred for several months, the drug use part has been sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment by the Criminal Court of the Xiuning District Court. The remaining parts will also be prosecuted before the end of this month. The change may extend the trial period.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Anhui Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau will soon send a survey team to the south to survey the upper reaches of the Xin'an River for suitable small-scale hydropower plant projects. The Anhui Provincial Government has also telegraphed the Southern Anhui Administrative Office here to send personnel to conduct on-site surveys for planning and construction. In the future, after the Jiekou Dam is built, this number of small power plants, like satellites, will be connected into one, and the prospect of electrifying the southeast can be seen. The slogan of building Southern Anhui will also be gradually developed with this power.</p>
<h3>Two Professors at Guangxi University's Preparatory Class Fight Each Other</h3>
<p>Dispute Between Teachers and Students at Guilin Vocational School</p>
<p>[Airlifted Dispatch from Guilin by This Newspaper, 18th of This Month] More than 300 students in the preparatory class of National Guangxi University are deadlocked with the school authorities over the issue of direct promotion. On the 17th, a strange incident of professors fighting each other occurred. Deputy Professor Zhan Daoming of the school, in the name of the chairman of a private middle school in Liuzhou, raised funds from students, which was quite large. Deputy Professor Wang Chaowei reported this to the school, saying that Zhan was coercing students to donate money, and the students' academic performance depended on the amount of donation. After investigation by the school, it was found that there was no such thing, and Wang was reprimanded for causing trouble for no reason. Therefore, Wang held a grudge in his heart. When they met on campus, Wang punched Zhan with his old fists, causing him to bleed from the head. The professors and students, believing that Wang was unreasonable, supported Zhan and proposed three conditions for Wang to accept: (1) Please Wang resign, (2) Apologize to Zhan, (3) Compensate for medical expenses. Wang also knew that he was in the wrong, so he packed his bags and left.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Following the Guangxi University incident, there was a dispute between teachers and students at the provincial Guilin Vocational School. The incident originated from the students of the Spinning Class 1 of the school, who were dissatisfied with the Dean of Students Chen Xuan. On the 14th, they surrounded Chen in the office and questioned him, saying that Chen was unfair in his work and the principal did not care about school affairs. Afterwards, they asked the provincial government and the provincial council to replace the Dean of Students and punish the principal. The school authorities defended themselves to the public on five points: (1) The principal often stays in the school and handles school affairs. On the 14th, student Wu Lijun cheated in the exam and refused to accept punishment. The students of the class were used to surround Dean Chen. (2) Dean Chen Xuan has been working hard since taking office. (3) Student Zhao Fengsheng was corrupt in handling food and has been ordered to find a guarantor to pay back the money within a limited time, and will be punished after the money is paid back. (4) Student Wu Lijun cheated in the exam and was given two minor demerits. Afterwards, he insulted the teacher in the office and was given two major demerits. (5) The students published news in the newspaper saying that the teacher and student representatives visited Huang Puxin, Director of the Provincial Department of Education, on the 17th to petition, but there was no such fact. The students pointed out that Director Chen was unfair in his handling, did not accept the students' requests, did not punish student Zhao Fengsheng, who was corrupt with more than 1,000 jin of rice, but gave student Wu Lijun, who cheated in the exam, two minor demerits and two major demerits. The principal did not stay at the school on weekdays. On the day of the incident, he hurriedly returned to the school and explained to the students in the class that Wu's two demerits were a mistake, hoping to calm the public anger. Currently, the students are determined to replace the Dean of Students and punish the principal, and the matter has not been resolved.</p>
<h3>The Dynamics of Refugee Students in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>— Reporter for This Newspaper, Liu Zao</p>
<p>A Glimpse of School Relocation</p>
<p>The war has spread from the Yellow River to the Yangtze River. Currently, schools in the Pinghan Road and Shanghai-Nanjing areas are still preparing to relocate south. Nanjing Zhengda University has decided to relocate to Gan County. More than 100 people from Tangshan Institute of Technology have arrived in Pingxiang. According to news from the Department of Education, 1,341 students from the war zone have been received for transit. Among them, there are 3,942 students from Henan, 5,909 from Shandong, 500 from Hebei, and 350 from the Northeast. Among them, 5,909 people have transferred to Hunan, and 8,392 people have stayed in various counties and cities in Jiangxi Province. Among them, 300 students from Henan Provincial Anyang High School are located in Chashi, Fengcheng. 350 students from Anyang Middle School are located in Chashi, Fengcheng. 550 students from Zhengxian Agricultural High School are located in Hepu, Yichun. 250 students from Zhengzhou Joint Middle School are located in Niuwan, Qingjiang. 300 students from Wuzhi Middle School are located in Yongtai, Qingjiang. 200 students from Zhongzheng Middle School are located in Ji'an. 160 students from Suiyang Middle School are located in Xiangdong Village, Nanchang City. 700 students from Zhengxian Branch School are located in Qingyuan Mountain, Ji'an. 500 students from Hebei Provincial Second Provisional Middle School are located in Shangdundu, Linchuan. 300 students from the Youth Guidance Class of the Ministry of Education are located in Fenyi. 580 students from Henan Provincial Kaifeng Girls' Middle School are located in Fenyi. 400 students from Zhiqiang Middle School are located in Shangqing Palace, Guixi. 2,000 students from Daliang Middle School are located in Qianshan. 429 students from Henan Provincial Commercial College are located in Gao'an. 300 students from Jixian Middle School are located in Fengcheng. Some students from Lizhi Middle School have arrived in the province and are located in Yanxi Ferry, Taihe.</p>
<p>Difficulties</p>
<p>The most difficult thing for the Jiangxi Department of Education regarding refugee students in the war zone is that the students from various schools are scattered in various places. The Jiangxi Department of Education can only fulfill its responsibility as the host to receive or find ways to settle them. The funds for each school are not within its power and cannot be borne. However, sometimes students have no food to eat, but they still turn to the Department of Education for help, which makes "Zhou Fuzi" feel unable to help. Therefore, he hopes that the Provincial Department of Education, which is relocating schools from the war zone to Jiangxi, should send people to Jiangxi to set up an agency to be responsible for managing the students and paying their expenses. Before the school is relocated, they should contact the Jiangxi Department of Education to consider the local situation and solve the problems of school site allocation and food supply.</p>
