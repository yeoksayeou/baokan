<h3>何應欽受命組新閣　李代總統咨文今送立院　傳副院長由紹竑擔任</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕據悉李代總統邀請何應欽氏出任新行政院長，何氏雖一再表示謙讓，但經愼重考慮後，已不再堅辭，據接近李代總統人士十日晚透露：何氏已允出任新行政院長，可能於十一二由杭飛返南京。此為十日京杭間長途電話中之決定，如無其他變化，李代總統提名新行政院長咨請立院同意之咨文，十一日晨可望送達立院。咨文中究提名何人出任，有關人士十一晚仍拒絕透露，惟據一般推測，其人選屬於何應欽，殆已不成問題。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十日電〕杭垣十日風雨交作，何應欽將軍靜居裏西湖湯公館，全日未曾出遊。本報記者往訪叩詢組閣事，渠首笑語記者，謂渠係一軍人，不請政治，實未敢出任艱鉅。李代總統雖有電話來杭，經答以派機亦屬無用。又謂聞李代總統已派甘介侯邱昌渭來杭之說，惟迄未晤及。最近或擬易地一遊，暫不返京。繼談及和戰問題，謂渠於抗戰勝利後，曾致力國際和平工作，至國內和平素所企望，惟須雙方確具誠意，如再長此作戰，則元氣喪盡，將使國家倒退數十年。如需個人對和平工作參予努力，固義不容辭。渠對杭州頗為留戀，與記者談話時，對窗外迷霧中之湖山景色，頻頻顧盼。宣鐵吾相隨左右，日來陪同何氏辦曁名勝古蹟。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕立院第三會期第四次會議，定十一日晨舉行，屆時仍將依照義程規定，討論提案，惟李代總統提名行政院長之咨文如於十一日送到，當於卽日院會中報告，改為投同意票，俾能迅速同意新行政院長人選，而利新政院之早日組成，惟截至十日晚止，立院尚未接獲總統府關於提名之咨文。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕某權威人士十日晚就總統提名行政院長之手續問題對記者談稱：總統提名行政院長人選，咨請立法院同意，為憲法賦予總統之權力，惟政黨政治與議會政治，互為表裏，所提人選如為黨員，依照一般常軌及國民黨之慣例，應先在中常會中提出通過，再向立法院咨請同意，現國民黨中常委在京滬一帶者固足法定人數，惟以中央黨部業已遷穗，常會應在廣州召開，除非先向廣州方面取得同意，中常會似不宜在南京舉行。此次孫科院長辭職，適逢國事最艱難之秋，為使政務不致長久中斷，李代總統可能於事先徵求有闢各方之同意，卽行咨請立院同意，再補行中常會通過之手續，俾資迅捷，故李代總統如已獲有關方面之同意，則逕咨立院之舉，亦屬用宜之計。</p>

<h3>舊閣首長來滬　即飛穗辦移交　孫科二三日內離南</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕水利部長鍾天心，工商部長劉維熾，地政部長吳尙鷹，昨由京抵滬，一二日內卽飛廣州，辦理移交事宜。孫院長亦將於二三日內來滬轉穗，處理政院移交工作。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕吳鐵城定十一日夜車赴滬，在滬停一二日後，卽自滬飛穗，趕辦移交事宜。外部總務司長馮宗蕚，已先於十日夜車去滬。、</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十日電〕孫內閣總辭後，此間數名接近孫氏之立委表示渠等來穗，並非應孫院長邀請，而係由童院長通知者，渠等對孫內閣總辭，不感驚異，認為此因孫閣主張光榮和平，而為人所反對，故總辭為不可避免者，而一內閣因主張不能實行提出總辭，實為最平常之事。至彼等目前行止問題，據稱：立院如決定遷返南京，則穗辦事處當奉命遷返，同人等留穗抑赴京，憲法上並無强制規定，但此全在個人立塲決定，與政治見解無關。某立委稱，渠最堪慮者為舊閣辭去新閣未產生之時間拖延，國家將蒙受極大損失。又現留穗立委尙有六十餘人。</p>
<h3>國民黨中常會</h3>
<p>人數不足改開談話會</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十日電〕國民黨中常會，原定十日舉行在穗第四次會議，因留穗中常委不足法定人數，臨時改開談話會。</p>
<h3>孫科論政局</h3>
<p>阻共黨統治希望甚微　認新閣將遭更多困難</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十日電〕前行政院長孫科，十日單獨接見合衆社記者時，認為以談判或戰爭阻止共黨之統品中國，希望甚微。渠警告稱：「共黨統治之中國，將在世界性東西衝突中聯結蘇聯，此為無可逃避之結果」。孫氏認為，國民黨目前情况之大部份責任，在於蔣總統不能於馬歇爾將軍來華調解時與中共締和，幷在於美蘇間全球性「冷戰」。渠預料，不久將組成之新內閣，將遭遇較渠之內閣所遭遇之「更多困難」。</p>
<p>孫科否認蔣總統引退後曾向政府任何機構頒發「任何正式或直接命令」，但承認「蔣總統昔日許多下屬不時向渠請敎，常被人視為命令」。孫氏復謂，渠本人從未以電話·電報或兩件與蔣氏接觸。孫科以其在政府內之長久經騐而稱：「使政府陷於目前局面之主要責任，在於蔣總統不能在抗戰方結束時接受與中共獲致某種協議。當時即使臨時協議，亦可有助於重建國家經濟及軍事力量」。渠復稱：「當然不能將此點完全歸咎於蔣總統，此點亦因互相不信任與猜疑所致。國民黨之崩潰，亦由於東西間之冷戰。美國對華政策之遊移不定，亦與此有關」。</p>
<p>「共黨所控制之中國，除非共黨改變宗旨，除非共黨知接受經合署援助之益處，除非彼等為中國人之成份多，而為共產黨之成份少，必將加入蘇聯集團，此為旣定結論」。渠建議，「為避免此種可能，政府應在未來和談中堅持在國際政治方面嚴守中立，以及人民有生活方式之自由」。渠認為將來在與中共之任何協議中，此二點最屬重要·渠解釋稱，中國在抗戰與內戰中，巳受盡痛苦，「實不能再招致另外災難」。孫科繼稱，未來聯合政府中之外交政策，應不牽涉與中國直接無關問題之任何世界性未來衝突，諸如德國問題與大西洋公約問題。渠相信，中共在和談中極可能同意及此。</p>
<p>關於自由生活方式方面，孫科繼稱，除非和平解決中含有民主權利之有效保陣，尤其為選擇職業一項權利，決無令人滿意之和平解決。「當然，若干組織係屬必需，但組織不應極權化。」</p>
<p>評論立委發動拒絕美援時，孫氏稱：「此僅討好中共之舉」。渠稱，如無美援，工商業將陷窘境，失業者將更多。渠稱，『拒絕美援，非但陷中國於停頓狀態，且將置於絕境」。孫科復謂：「內政爭執削减政府力量，其地位正每况愈下」。渠並謂，當渠辭職時，未曾向李代總統薦繼任人。</p>
<h3>中共評孫閣總辭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中共廣播電台昨日發表新華社評論，以評述孫科內閣總辭職為題，繼續猛烈抨擊，謂「孫科下台並不表示國民黨停止反動或减少反動」，同時攻擊美國之援華，謂「國民黨反動派正依賴美帝國主義的力量，覓求內部的團結」。該社評論中指出，李代總統曾於七日邀白崇禧。司徒雷登及白吉爾將軍舉行會議·又謂，白崇禧已獲得李宗仁派遣代表赴美，「與美國軍閥取得密切聯繫」。</p>
<h3>立院和平意見書完稿　提今日院會討論　李代總統召邵力子商談</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十日電〕李代總統十日下午六時召見邵力子，對和談問題有所商討。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕鍾天心談：渠辭和談代表事，業經孫院長允准，相信李代總統亦可批准。目前和平方案業由十人委員會擬定初稿，並已送交李代總統，惟在手續上，該方案應先由黨內會議審核，並輕行政院政務會議通過後，方能正式提出作為和談之對案。</p>
<h3>劉蘆隱由蓉飛京</h3>

<h3>社論　速謀湘西事件的解決</h3>
<p>當共軍陳兵江岸，大局瀕臨和戰的最後關頭，舉國視綫集中江南政治風雲之際，大江南岸的湘西，忽然發生重大事件，且尙在蔓延與擴展之中，湖南省參議會連日開會，商討湘西事件的對策，並要求地方當局提高警覺，萬勿輕視為地方事件，疏於防範。長沙綏靖主任兼湖南省主席程潛將軍，適因要公滯京，省參議會巳電請速返鎭懾；湘西軍事首腦李默庵將軍現亦滯長不返，省參議會亦已促其速返防地，負責解決，以免事態擴大。另聞旅居京滬的湘人，為重視湘西事件，速日紛紛集會，僉以叛變區域擴大，情勢嚴重，紛請李代總統及程主任，予以重視，迅謀解決辦法，以免養癰貽息，釀成不可收拾的局面。</p>
<p>此次湘西事件，是匪警保安隊與地方人民匯合的武裝叛變，自上月下旬發難起，迄至今日為止，先後陷擾永順·保靖·龍山·麻陽·辰谿·沅陵等縣城，而叛軍的勢力，更西脅乾城，南迫芷江，東指淑浦，北向湘西重鎭的常德。彼輩並宣稱攻至常德後，始暫停軍事行動，足徵叛軍的行動是有目的有計劃的。此次湘西事變的造因，說來非常複雜。從遠的方面說，是戰後湘西未復員，民窮財盡未予救濟，加以地方官吏橫行，魚肉善良人民，到了大局紛亂的今天，終於百病迸發，而不可收拾。從近的方面說，是最近湖南徵兵擴軍甚急，省方欲改編保安團隊警察，以致團警有不穩的現象。又傳綏靖司令李默庵將軍處置或未盡適宜，遽對良民出以兵力彈壓圍剿，以致治絲益棼，擴大了事態。當事件發生之初，省府對此，決定剿撫兼施，執行上自然以圍剿重；省參議會則認識事變的政治性不濃，一致主張疏導，甚至會同省府派出代表，到沅陵與叛軍首腦舉行談判，冀圖湘人團結，一切地方問題均循政治途徑解決結果沅陵談判失敗了，城內一片大火，精華半成灰燼！談判破裂的原因，據叛民的「湘西人民反壓迫委員會」致電省參議會議長唐伯球及參議員何三畏說：李默庵「嗾使其特務團進駐沉陵，一而抗拒本軍，一面將沅陵洗劫一空，慘不忍睹，懇轉請程主席將其扣留。」又聞沅陵叛民提出三條件：（一）撤換李默庵，（二）湘西人自決，（三）湘西成立兩個師。而李默庵將軍滯留長沙的態度；亦强調政治解決，並否認有壓迫湘西人民情事。</p>
<p>根據以所述，我們相信湘西事件的政治色彩，截至目前為止，尙不十分濃厚，可看作一椿地方官民利害衝突的事件。此事之造成，當然是政治不修明，人謀不臧，地方人民是被迫而叛變的。如果事件的眞象果如斯，不會滲透其他政治因素的話，這事件是可能早日解決的。但是，假使當局只知拖延敷衍，則夜長夢多，不能保證叛變之不擴大，如果一旦從湘西波及到全湘，從湘邊影響到西南，那就不可收拾了。這是我們今天要特別提高朝野的警覺！</p>
<p>如所週知，湖南在今天長江以南的地位，是非常重要的。顧祖禹在「讀史方輿紀要」中說：一湖廣居八省之中，最為閉衍，山川險固，自古稱雄武焉。跨兩粵者，在乎郴永：捍雲貴者，重在長沅。」守湖南，則東南之守亦固；固湖南，則西南之勢亦强。我國八年對日抗戰的情勢，完全證明湖南地位之重要，湖南誠為東西南指臂之使。論湖南形勝者，尤必重視湘西。蓋湘西毘鄰鄂川黔桂，重山疊嶺，苗傜雜處，自古即為難治之區。在抗戰期中，湘西獨抗日寇，堵塞日軍無由跨越黔川，足徵湘西之處境可以自守自保。抗戰勝利的基礎，幾乎可說奠定在湘西，戰時省府建立在沅陵，而芷江受降一幕，國軍從湘西直薄長江下游，更說明湘西地位之重要，焉能予以忽視？不幸此次事件，却發難在抗戰基地的湘西，且日在蔓延與擴展之中，當是一件值得注意的事</p>
<p>為了搶救湘西，解決湘西事件，我們很贊同湘省參議會的主張，對地方事件，務以疏導方式，速為和平的處理，快刀斬麻，寗人息事，勿冉顢頇延宕了！程主任身繫三湘安危，應該早日返湘鎭懾，以大智大勇的精神，和平處理湘西事件，並澈底消除其發難的因素。中央的和談大計，儘有李代總統主持乾斷，已無逗留首都之必要。只須程主任能於極短期聞解決了湘西事件，就是有助於和談，有益於國家了。否則事態擴大，不獨非湖南之幸，且非國家之福。望三湘當局注意及之！</p>
<h3>湘西事件急轉直下　叛民撤出沅陵聽候收編　程潛提前定今返湘坐鎭</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙十日電〕湘西事件急轉直下，沅陵叛民領袖曹振亞部接受政府命令，九日下午四時撤出沅城，將先集中永順，聽候點驗，改編為保安第五旅，汪援華任旅長，曹振亞副之，汪並兼永（順）龍（山）淸剿司令，曹兼第一團長。陷辰谿叛民領袖張大治，張玉琳，亦將分任汪旅之第二·三團長。又，官方消息：保安十團汪援華部朱營移駐大庸，始終未曾妄動，政府將予嘉勉，另部張營雖參與叛亂，進駐辰谿，但亦表明心跡，聽候政府命令。截至目前止，湘西事件已趨和緩，今後發展，端視收編上之技術問題而定。</p>

<h3>湯恩伯招待出版界　希望言論六項原則　和談問題應以不違反平等為凖　協助文敎工作決成立文敎委會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬杭警備司令湯恩伯將軍，昨日下午三時，假座新生活俱樂部，茶會招待本市出版文化新聞界人士，宣佈渠對於各種報刋言論所希望之六項原則：（一）今後報刋對於和談問題應以不違反全面平等合理之和平為原則。（二）備戰謀和係政府旣定國策，任何報判不得登載中傷識諷或違反此項國策之文字。（三）言論應正確公平，不得破壞團結，挑撥離間，製造分裂，為害國家。（四）報道消息應以事實為依據，不得無中生有，造謠惑衆，各種電訊通訊尤須審愼發表，斟酌運用。（五）嚴禁洩漏軍事秘密及侮衊政府之宣傳文字。（六）報刋對於本區治安之維持，社會秩序之縱護，以及軍民合作之提倡，應共同鼓勵協助。</p>
<p>反動言論行動　將予嚴厲制裁</p>
<p>湯氏指出：目前與論對於和戰意見極不一致，有人主張免戰求和，認為備戰是和平障礙，要求政府取消徵兵徵糧，拒絕美援。但備戰求和，充實力量求平等的和平，為政府旣定國策，蓋人人有平等自由權利，斷無放棄而聽人支配之理，免戰求和卽是投降，卽是聽人支配。目前共黨軍事渡江非常困難，故先行發動「政治」「經濟」及「組織」之渡江，主張免戰求和者無形中中了共黨陰謀，無形中帮助共黨，此種反動言論及行動將予嚴厲制裁·湯氏又謂：目前政府雖遭受挫折，但並非絕對無辦法，與共黨鬥爭係國際問題之一環，從各方面看，我人仍有光明前途，希望輿論界領導帮助爭取平等自由的和平。此外一切言論應有其限度，不論中外記者均應邀守，勿作不利於國家地方之報道。對於外籍記者因彼等不明瞭我國國情，尙可原諒，惟亦希望彼等於作報道時特別審愼。本部為今後協助京滬文敎工作，已決定成立文敎委員會，由市黨部主任委員方治負責，希望各方與之合作云。</p>
<p>戰非一方可戰　和非一方可和</p>
<p>昨日出席招待會之出版文化界人士有潘公展。程滄波·嚴獨鶴·范爭波·方治·曹俊等百餘人。湯總司令發表上項談話之前，程滄波·潘公展·范爭波曾先後致詞，並有范雪君之彈唱餘興。程滄波甫自首都歸來，報告首都現狀己安定得多。潘公展對於反對備戰言和者加以痛斥，指出戰非一方面可戰，和非一方面可和。主張在未獲和平確實保障前，本市城防工事仍應加緊完成，寗可備而不用。潘氏又對少數外國記者之作歪曲報導表示深惡痛絕，特別關於蔣總統退休後之種種謠言，尤屬無理，故主張外籍記者應一律平等受到限制，不得越出範圍。范爭波氏希望此後招待會能時常舉行，俾可以共同交換意見，湯氏對此項建議卽表示接受，茶會迄五時許始散。</p>

<h3>北大西洋公約範圍擴大　決羅致義葡丹參加　西歐五國昨在倫敦集會　對公約草案作最後審查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十日廣播：可靠方面消息，明日舉行之北大西洋公約會議中，將決定簽約之日期及地點。丹外長明日將訪艾契遜，但未必參加會議。草案全文將於會後交義政府審核。此間咸信丹政府可於下週中核准該約之條文，但迄今為止，冰島及葡萄牙之態度尙不可知。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕英外交部昨自華盛頓接獲大西洋公約草案全文後，今日由內閣召開全體會加以討論。外交界人士咸料英閣之通過殆無問題。若該約之七國政府卽美英法荷比盧加，得於下星期二之前批准草案全文，則公約全文可望於下週三公布。倫敦方面相信此一歷史性的條約，於四月五日卽可在華盛頓舉行正式簽字儀式。西歐聯盟五國代表今晨齊集倫敦，討論對該公約之批准。英外部發表聲明，謂五國代表將於週一在倫敦再度開會，對公約內容作是後的審查，審查畢卽可在華盛頓舉行最後的簽字儀式。此一倫敦會議之召開，在解決五國間就該約無關重要的歧見。同時西歐聯盟五國並已柬邀義丹挪冰島愛爾蘭五國派觀察員列席週一在倫教舉行之西歐聯盟五國會議。外交界人士對此一會議極為重視，蓋會議如獲成功，卽不帝歐洲方面之批准大西洋公約，由於該約已曾在華盛頓經過長期的討論，故料此次倫敦會議必能迅速順利結束。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十日廣播：成功湖訊，安理會今日討論印尼問題時，菲代表羅慕洛提出警告，要求各國注意荷蘭在海牙召集圓桌會議之後果。羅氏稱，圓桌會議雖為荷方新的手法，但荷蘭之目的仍為一貫的置安理會之決議於不顧，可和則和，必要時卽出之一戰，為所欲為，罔顧信義。</p>
<p>羅氏稱：荷代表於六星期前，曾在本會提出神聖之諾言，謂印尼領袖卽可釋放，而其後竟卽食言，印尼之總統及總理至今仍被拘禁於邦加島。羅氏並指責荷方曾阻撓聯合國軍事調解會之工作，而印尼則始終尊電聯合國之決議。羅氏繼乃提出遠東十九國所提關於解決印尼問題之辦法，請安理會予以討論。傳英對荷正施用壓力</p>

<p>〔聯合社成功湖十日電〕荷蘭駐聯合國機構首席代表范東揚今日宣稱，荷蘭政府認為不能遵照安理會訓令使印尼共和國領袖恢復政權，余將於今日下午安理會開會時說明此事。深信印尼領袖若獲釋放，必將立卽乘機發動破壞並加强游擊戰。荷蘭雖希望全印尼獨立，但不希望此種獨立有如緬甸之混亂。外傳荷方准許印尼領袖回到日惹一節毫無根據。余昨夜曾與本國外長史蒂克通電話，證實政府立塲並未改變。</p>

<h3>華府傳六個月至九個月內　麥帥將自日本退休　對日軍事管制制度將改為文官制</h3>

<h3>公用事業要求貸款　數達四百餘萬美金　國行無力負担今日討論核減</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會公用小組委員會，以本市各公用事業公司開列之月需成本費為數過於龐大，總數為四百五十七萬二百四十五元四角一分美金，經參議會請願代表會同市府主管向中央銀行初步洽商後，未經接受，特於昨日下午三時，在市參議會召開臨時小組委員會，討論二項提案，決議如下：甲，請求中央銀行分借各公用事業公司所需週轉金數額如何決定案。決議：（一）各公用事業每月所需最低限度之必需週轉金，除各公司儘力自籌外，由公用局詳加審查各公司存料多寡，及工資實際需要，核定數目，向中央銀行洽借。（二）公用局審查各公司借款數額時，由本會審查基數之代表，及中央銀行代表共同參加，並定於今日上午十時，在公用局舉行審查會議。審查借款，以下列三項資料為根據：一，截至三月十日為止，各公司之主要生產及維持物料存量。二，每月必需之生產或維持物料數額。三，公共交通公司載至三月九日止，現有現金數額及二月份發薪基數總額。（三）向中央銀行請求借款時，由本會請願代表，會同市長及公用局長接洽，並定今日下午三時卽行向中央銀行接治。</p>

<p>汪竹一報告　洽借款經過</p>
<p>繼卽由汪竹一報告昨晨赴央行接洽借款之經過，略稱：今日至央行請貸款者，有吳市長，潘議長，徐副議長，項秘書長，及參議員張中原，姜豪，馬君碩，公用局長趙曾玨。時劉攻芸，林崇鏞均在行。代表等當表示參議會處於顧到市民負擔及維護公用事業二者之間，深覺困難。代表人民說話乃參議會應盡之義務，今天大家覺得，唯一出路，只有向央行請求貸款，則一面公用事業可告維持、且可深得民心，希央行務必加以援手。劉總裁及林局長均表示原則上可予貸借，惟如此龐大美金數字，折合金圓券近三百億之譜，巳等於金圓券發行額三分之一，央行絕對無法負擔，希望參議會及市府能嚴予審核其最低數字，則央行樂於貸予云云。</p>
<p>上午審查數額　下午再往洽借</p>
<p>汪參議員報告完畢，卽行開始討論貸款之數額問題，一致認為四百餘萬美金驚人鉅大，本擬將其近减為一百萬美金，後經潘議長表示參議會之責任，在於審定基數，並根據基數按生活指數倍數計費，至於因上下期指數間之經濟脫節虧損，應由各公司自行張羅，張羅不到時，由市府助其向央行貸款，至數額多寡，參議會無權亦無責任加以決定，故建議由公用小組會同市府詳細審查賬目，存料有無逃匿情事，然後再定數額。當經一致通過，定今日上午趕速審查。並決於下午二時前趨訪財政部長徐堪，三時卽赴央行進行貸款。</p>

<h3>贛省制止械鬥　頒布處理辦法　殺人放火者處極刑　雙方武器限令登記</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌八日訊〕贛省各地的械鬥，已經是由扁挑鐵鋤的單打，進入到機關槍，迫擊砲的陣地戰，去年分宜之役，就是江西械鬥戰中最偉大的一幕。最近餘干，南昌，新喻……等地，衝殺的流血事件，不斷發生，省保安司令部對此類「地方事件」，已感覺彈壓不住，制止弗效，苦惱萬分。</p>
<p>械鬥起因</p>
<p>看看分宜縣屬介橋湖澤西茶洞的械鬥，與餘干的梅溪，新喻的江東圩的血案，眞叫人痛心。爲什麼素稱文章節義之邦的江西，這些無知的人民會如此勇於私鬥！據一般的分析，不外下面幾個原因：</p>
<p>（一）由於地方派系意氣，而有地方强覇人士在幕後指使，以致鬧成械鬥。</p>
<p>（二）由於姓氏戳念，封建部落思想作祟，對於一姓一村或鄉保甲內，應盡義務，應事權利，分擔不平，以致發生衝突。</p>
<p>（三）由於爭奪一姓一村的農田水利，漁牧，狩獵，森林，墳地，學產，以致發生衝突。</p>
<p>（四）土豪劣紳，地方派系人士，企圖利用械鬥，爭取或保持其封建或特有地位與權益。</p>
<p>（五）無業遊民，挑撥是非，致生意氣而形成衝突。</p>
<p>（六）無知愚民脅迫盲從參加。　方天逸主席以各地械鬥事件，不時發生，不僅斷傷地方元氣，而且破壞精神團結，特擬訂處理械鬥辦法，頒發各縣，並發表「消弭械鬥敬吿全省民衆書」。</p>
<p>處理辦法</p>
<p>省政府現決定，嗣後如再發生此類流血事件，本着處理辦法辦理，其中主點如次：（一）將首倡械鬥及幕後主使之人，依法嚴懲，（二）參加械鬥實施殺人放火者，依法處以極刑。（三）發生械鬥地區，經政府公平制止無效，或不接受政府公平處置仍繼續械鬥者，由政府派隊進剿。（四）械鬥區域由當地政府立卽組織公正會，推定地方公正人士主張公道，評定是非，確定犯罪者之罪嫌，報吿政府法辦。（五）所有參加械鬥雙方槍枝武器，限期登記烙印，仍准配給當地政府發交民衆自衛隊，作爲自衛之用。（六）參加械鬥盲從份子，一律提服兵役。（七）械鬥地區之鄕保甲長，如事先不報，致釀成械鬥者，從嚴懲辦。（八）密報械鬥武器收藏地點，因而查獲者，從優給獎。</p>

<h3>澄發生恐嚇信案　法醫劉博羣被押</h3>
<p>〔本報江陰九日訊〕城內近日發生一件恐嚇事情，轟動一時，經警局以迅捷手段破獲。緣有中山鎭十一保保長仰燮培，藉祖上餘蔭，薄有資產，於上月十九日起，連接署名「八路軍老二團駐澄辦事處」主任陳同恐嚇信三次，索詐黃金五錢，信內並附有槍彈一顆，內容荒謬，囑將黃金安放馬嘶橋西南角石縫中。仰保長將重二錢半金戒一只，送馬嘶橋，一面暗伏人員窺探，果見一人在該處徘徊，查問之下，其人出示江陰地方法院法醫職員證，姓名劉博羣，因無其他證據，未予扣留。而本月五日住虹橋南河沿寳盛銀樓店主俞馥森，亦接得上項同樣署名恐嚇信，三次附槍彈五粒，情報室百般設計，偵得仰之戒子在中山鎭幹事張少林親戚處，並知該項金戒，乃爲劉博羣取去後，典押於人。至七日，縣府派警至文亨橋，將劉拘獲，並搜獲步槍彈四顆藍墨水一瓶，信紙，肥皂雕成假印，給常熟南外花園飯店楊仲倫副官信件等物，當卽押至縣府，由軍法室漏夜訊問，劉博羣對此案堅予否認，僅稱槍彈係經過軍隊遺漏，信係江北季家市人顧元鴻所寫，已於去冬回家。金戒子是北外大東旅館茶房丁阿根之物，惟自承吸食白粉，已有一年，現任地方法院法醫等語。縣府以案情重大，將劉收押，一面搜集有力證件，依法嚴辦。</p>

<h3>三人小組研討改善技術　國行昨仍繼續配金　銀根抽緊金市步步盤小</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行昨因隔日金價波動過劇，且配價與市價脫節過甚，昨晨經三人小組會愼密研討技術上改善辦法，故對銀樓業之開價，遲延至上午十時半始行報出，決定配價為廿九萬元，並通知銀樓業如屬需要，可卽辦理申請。上午申請時間，延至中午十二時半載止。結果共配出一千餘兩。下午繼續通知銀樓業照老價配售，惟以市價盤小，結果無人申請。</p>
<p>後據國行業務局負責人语記者，國行對擴大配金範圍，仍在擬議中。惟目前對售金方式，表面上雖為通過銀樓業，認錢不認人，祗要有頭寸，決可儘量拗售·同時，在市塲上亦正採取種種有效方法，以達控制金價之目的。如今（十日）日金價之盤低，卽一明證。至金銀公開市塲，現仍在積極籌組中。至外傳外埠近日有大批匯款到滬之說，渠表示朱有所聞。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日金市，因銀根抽緊，早晨卽以二十九萬五千元至三十萬元之低盤開出。後銀根緊勢愈甚，行市亦步步盤小，最低見二十八萬四至二十八萬七之低價。而市塲風傳銀錢同業之轉賬申請書，巳不允予顧客以通融，故金業方面為謹愼計，上午十一時半許，卽告收市，時價為二八萬七至二十九萬元。下午二時開市，銀根仍緊，行市呈盤檔之局，最後以三十萬至三十萬三千元收市。該項行市，如以扣除日拆一元計算，僅合當日黃金行市二十七萬元。</p>

<p>在金融当局拋物抑價之時，銀根又形緊迫，買氣渙散，臨收半點鐘，更傳央行通知停止交換申請書使用，藉减通貨流轉時間，以是浮買更感窘迫，脫售斬了，以避高息。故永紗自破五元二角而後，直綫下降，迄於午收竟以其當日低價四元八角七分收盤，回復週初之價。其高價在初開之頃，為五元四角二分，低價為四元八角七分，計有五角五分起落幅徑。他股亦多疲降，均回跌一成以上以至於二成許。麗安獨降至跌限。台糖一五〇〇元，永業跌十元，惟新亞振華聯華國貨新華均上升一二成，半日成交共三五億七四九〇股</p>
<p>黃金公債初開一四九，〇〇〇元，步升至一六〇，〇〇〇元，稍盤少頃，又自一六〇，〇〇〇元降至一四〇，〇〇〇元，為其當日低降，計有二〇，〇〇〇元上落。午收為一五一，〇〇〇元，計降一一，〇〇〇元，半日共做四十一兩。後市初做一五四，〇〇〇元，卽低至一五三，〇〇〇元。後升上至一五五，〇〇〇元，計二，〇〇〇元上落，較上日降七〇，〇〇元，成交計二十兩。</p>
<h3>外股止堅回疲</h3>
<p>外股止堅轉疲，圈中銀根頗緊，日拆暗息在八十元以上，故人心更形虛軟，怡紗做九千元，九千三百元，較上日軋小一千五百元。英聯做一千一百元，一千二百元，較上日挫降一百五十元。業廣瀉勢頗勁，做二千八百元，三千一百元，小五百元之譜。會德豐上落頗大，做二萬七千元，三萬元。較上日下瀉一成餘，其餘各股均見軋小數百元之巨。</p>
<h3>銀錢業調整拆息</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀錢信託三業之存放日拆，自今日起改訂如次（十）放款日拆（每千元）六〇元，同業日拆四八元，同業欠款日拆十五元。</p>
<p>又中央銀行對同業存款日拆，三月份決調整為四十元，原為卅二元。</p>
<h3>清償法幣公債　昨已依限結束</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕按照修訂「政府法幣公債處理辦法」規定，原訂各債票面分級加倍應還法幣數額（原定最高二七，〇〇〇倍，最低一，〇〇〇）業經修訂為最高一，三五〇，〇〇〇倍，最低五〇，〇〇〇倍，按法定折合率折付金圓券，仍予提前一次淸償，並限於一個月內辦理竣事。但在修訂辦法施行以前，業已提前淸償者，不再加倍補付。茲悉：國行國庫局曁各地經理行局已根據財政部電示，於二月十一日起，開始依照修訂辦法，規定倍數辦理淸償，於昨日（十日）依限結束云。</p>
<h3>國行修正區行制度　各區將為獨立機構</h3>
<p>中央銀行區行制度，業已建立。惟現以時局演變，各區行之職權與組織，均將重新訂定。此次漢口·廣州·重慶各區行主任集滬，對此問題有所會商。據悉（十）各區行將為一獨立機構，除執行總行命令外，在某種限度內，有其特殊之權限，可以自行處理，並經常巡週督導轄區各分支行行處業務。現已臻具體，經劉總裁批准後，卽可實行。各區主任楊汝梅·丁世琪·楊曉波等均已分別返任，正式執行任務。</p>
<h3>貼放農業顧問會　昨開第六次會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會農藥顧問委員會第六次會議，業於昨日下午三時舉行會議，出席該會副秘書長方善桂，曁委員張心一，汪茂慶等，討論卅八年度儀貸計劇，及其他有關案件多起。聞對本年度農貸，為適應農時，擬建議在未奉政府核定前，酌先撥貸。但仍待下週貼放會核定一云。</p>
<h3>貨主依然扳高　食米繼續挺漲　麵粉油市臨收均見略挫</h3>
<p>食米漲勢持續，因上日其他物價上漲較多，故貨主仍見扳高，早開白粳薄稻曾突破三萬元大關，做三萬〇五百元，後市因業外價短，銀根緊俏，乃告回落。北市白粳終為三萬元，漲二千元，特粳做三萬一一千元高價，南市厚薄粳各漲二千餘元，二市到貨共計八三七三石。</p>
<p>食油　依然上漲，惟收市已轉回疲，終仍軋升，初開尙平，中市買氣甚旺，生菜油曾到十二萬元，豆油最高十二萬七千元，收市終為銀根緊俏，及業外價跌等關係，仍告回落，豆油收市十二萬二千，漲七千元，生菜油為十一萬四千，漲四千元，生油中市开出價十五萬（九）吉桶）漲一萬二千元，豆餅收市平。</p>
<p>麵粉　在國行竭力抽緊銀根下，執户求售心切，初市雖曾因米價上漲而一度高揚，後市終以晴息高昂，人心虛軟，且拋售物資謠傳不絕於耳，進戶多具戒心，未敢大量報進。老車臨收一萬二千八百五十元，兵船後市做一萬二千三百十元，比前日微升二百元。麩皮略揚，大包福新臨收站定萬關。</p>
<p>雜糧　漲勢緩和，黃豆漲後略回，緣因油餅轉疲，車豆後市疲落千元，做二萬七千元，芝蔴菉豆挺升二千元，生仁平定，苞米紅糧微趨上揚。</p>
<h3>糖市平堅</h3>
<p>食糖昨因銀根緊俏，業內做息特高，但因實銷尙暢，本客帮後補不絕，市况明升暗平。四半先做五三〇〇〇元，聞金價報跌，人心殊虛，一度小至五一五〇〇元，嗣後客帮動辦，買風展開，喊價回升，近午正於五二〇〇〇元收市，粗砂四九五〇〇元，升二五〇〇元，中砂興赤綿次台赤棉白未見做開外，其餘均微升千元。</p>
<h3>茶市迂廻步堅</h3>
<p>昨日紅綠茶，仍得買戶靑睞，惟交易續以貨稀供缺，做開依然萎凋。而其趨勢，處於上述情形中，不受銀根束縛，復又迂迥步堅，價格方面，則受貨品關係，一致明平暗挺。　茲悉（十）目前蘇。錫等地，對於粗紅茶，來者不拒，刻已派員四起搜羅，如能如願，將有一番熱閙。</p>
<h3>桐油再升</h3>
<p>桐汕昨市，初漲後平，晨開卽因外匯移轉證俏秀，人心奇挺，買氣濃郁，賣戶扳提甚勁，行市昂然邁進。迨後在銀根緊　中，同業無不遭受打擊，漲風驟告戢止，而與日相較，依然軋升頗多。</p>
<h3>煤價昨又調整</h3>
<p>四礦聯營處消息，燃配配價昨再調整，本國烟煤配價對加至每噸八三，二二〇元，較前升起一二八二〇元。白煤納子及小子每噸九〇〇〇元，白煤塊一三〇〇〇〇元，白煤屑八〇〇〇〇元。駁運費仍為八千元。惟外國煤依舊無貨，仍暫停配云。</p>
<h3>絲綢疲軟</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况，因市上銀根奇緊，圈外物價止漲反跌，人心疲軟，行情步挫。</p>
<p>102號有光新貨，晨開時見一四〇萬，開後趨勢甚軟，但因隔昨散空抵補，納胃微動，喊價升起三萬元，嗣後金鈔走勢疲軟，行情步挫，而銀根緊俏有加，暗息續升，抬面吐售不絕，市勢重入軟檔，迨至臨收仍無好面，終以一四〇萬卽期現貨午收，隔日頭寸為一四九萬元。午後銀根緊勢續見俏利，圈外金鈔帶息再見盤小，市勢依然庸弱，東洋初做一四四萬二千元，三時以後黃金由三一〇而逐步回小，盤旋於三〇三之間，於是人心仍虛，喊價再度下坡，終以一四二萬七千元結束。</p>
<p>生絲昨日外匯證市勢報升，人心稍定，惟因市上銀根抽緊，缺單週轉不易，市况平軟。78匀度白廠絲晨初見二一〇萬，中聞一度回升至二一八萬，嗣後黃金報跌，業外紗布趨疲，市呈不支，價卽步趨下游，近午小至二〇〇萬收市。午後市勢平庸，但本街帮乘低搜求，做價略高喊二〇五萬元。</p>
<p>綢緞昨日市勢亦軟，業內銀根普緊，暗息抬升，散戶脫貨放息，多頭翻空心思濃厚，市况先盤後軟，午收時終見軋小。美亞被面晨開九六五〇〇〇元，喊後趨勢平庸，但因多頭欲放先拉，一度喊高一萬元，惟因業外大勢均疲，金鈔報跌，華股仍疲，市勢無法掙扎，喊價步落，低見九三五〇〇〇元，近午仍以原盤收市。午後金鈔走勢初見盤升後，仍多軟弱，是以人心閒散，初因金價帶息盤升，市况尙穩，先喊九六萬九七萬，一度小至九四萬，最後仍以九二五〇〇〇元結束。</p>
<h3>牌價決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局九日人造絲會議議決（十）本年度第十次（七日至十二日）人絲牌價，意大利貨一二〇號三級有光，每箱金圓一，一二八，〇〇〇元。</p>
<h3>銀根特別緊俏　日拆高做一百五　中午過後緊勢有增無減　今日結款仍多可能續俏</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市銀根，終日緊俏。晨開以隔日紗布結款十一餘億元，卽待解繳，銀根卽轉俏利，日拆以八十元開出。然各處均屬扒借多於拆出，而銀錢業對客戶之轉帳申請書，有不予通融之說，日拆遂步高至九十至九十五元。中午過後，緊勢有增無减，日拆叩一百元關，一度曾哄高至一百五十元。下午四時過後，同業中缺單者比比皆是，業中互拆為一百二十元。</p>
<p>國家行局結果差入六七六一七萬元，洋商各行差入五九六八二萬元，大交換各行差出二一七〇七萬元，小交換各行差出一〇五五九二萬元。</p>
<p>又今日將有中央銀行及紡建公司等鉅額紗布結款廿一餘億元，故頭寸恐仍將維持昨日之緊勢。</p>
<h3>市塲散步　看客台</h3>
<p>跌價抽不多跌小抽得大　貝祖詒胡後金搏鬥重演</p>
<p>昨天銀根大緊，臨晚暗息鬥高出一元半之多，眞的駭人聽聞了。</p>
<p>大家都說銀根緊，為了當局大量拋貨物資。昨天，當局的努力是眞的，同時也有廠商為了籌發月中工資，也在敲出，所以更助成了跌勢。</p>
<p>我們前已分析過，拋物資而眞能抽緊銀根，那末物價不會背小的。拋物資而物價跟小，那末就未曾抽到銀根。</p>
<p>這因果關係是很明白的，拋物資，而能抽緊銀根，必因有人買去，旣有人買去，物價就落不下來，這也是一定的。</p>
<p>拋物資而物價落下來，一定無人接受。旣然無人應購，就沒有抽到銀根，這也一定的。</p>
<p>當然，市塲情形斷非如此單純的，但無論如何，不出這個基本原理。</p>
<p>昨天市面趨疲中最大特色：申購配金量之减少；（二）股市疲落最慘；（三）午後金鈔一度跌進央行牌價，後稍回上，但仍合不上拆息；（四）米價獨特狂漲，（五）捲烟燭皂等工業產品，傾跌特盛；（六）進口貨雖跌亦不大。</p>
<p>照理金鈔受打擊，游資可流入股市，昨股市不應小而小，足見是銀根關係。</p>
<p>申購配金少，午後一度跌進脾價，可見前天申購配金的銀樓業，昨天別不到頭寸，只好窮殺甩出了；才呈這種奇象。那末銀根緊在銀樓業，他們又重蹈過去貝祖詒黃金政策所佈的羅網了，貝祖詒有後了。</p>
<p>米價獨特高漲，而工業產品跌落兇，可見月中發薪，廠商不得不斬貨籌款，此於農民無關，與米價無關，故米價獨特上漲了。</p>
<p>進口貨並不甚疲，也和米市相仿。</p>
<p>如果這種分析不錯，那末昨天眞在拋斬的恐是銀樓業，恐是廠商家。當局或許也拋，但決不及宣傳之盛。</p>
<p>市塲動盪心理關係重大，宣傳便成雙方搏鬥的工具，而對渺視當局實力者，張大宣傳，尤為必要了。</p>
<p>前天我們又指出月中之前，有漲也非眞性。昨天市况，說明這種事實。</p>
<p>今天週五，明天週六，顧慮利息的廠商，拋了放拆息，到期付薪資。這算盤，又以早一天便宜一天了。</p>
<h3>銀樓門市忽冷忽熱　扒借頭寸叫苦連天</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀樓業，昨以中央銀行報出行市過遲，開業時間亦均延至上午十時半以後。而市民以隔日黃金行市暴漲，而中央銀行則仍以廿五萬元之配價，着銀樓業掛牌售金，故咸以為今日仍有便宜可購，各銀樓貨開業前，門口卽有不少顧客持鈔鵠候。待開門後驟覩掛牌價條塊已改為廿九萬五千八百元，手飾金為三十萬〇七千元後，頗多沮喪而歸者。而銀樓業以黃金晨開，尙呈盤檔，接中央銀行廿九萬有配之通知後，同業申請配購者居然亦超過千兩之譜。惟下午行市仍疲，如再扣一日拆息，則國行之配價且已超過市價，故紛紛要求將原已申請之黃金，退還國行。國行不允所請，各銀樓祗得紛紛扒借頭寸，抵還請購之金款，莫不叫苦連天。而各銀樓門市營業，昨亦以金價盤小關係，突轉冷靜，與日前機構之情形，適（二）强烈之對比。</p>
<h3>紗價高後轉跌　棉布軟檔徘徊</h3>
<p>棉紗漲風已戢，良以當局拋售物資，抽緊銀根，昨日拆息在八十元至一百元之間，故散多不勝重息負担，求售心切，客帮亦大多抱觀望態度，各紗高後又跌，結果終於軋小。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳由二百十八萬元喊至二百廿三萬元為最高，收市為二百〇七萬元，軋降十一萬元，四〇支藍鳳挫八萬元，三二支銀月降九萬元，以一百三十七萬元結束。</p>
<p>廿一支雙馬現貨初以一百〇七萬元開出，中途曾扳上一百十一萬元，終以銀根太緊，其勢不支，乃退至一百〇二萬五千元收市，較前跌十二萬五千元。廠單做一百〇二萬元。廿支各級一致跌進關內，皆在九十五萬元左右成交，十六支以下各檔亦告萎靡。</p>
<p>棉布盤旋軟檔，晨開因銀根趨緊，且隔日上漲過厲，人心有所顧忌，浮多紛紛吐售，但空方抵補者甚衆，故供求尙稱平衡。</p>
<p>開市龍頭細布四萬〇六百元，四君子元嗶嘰三萬九千九百元，當紡建開貨未曉之前，一度各喊高五百元，迨掛牌後，仍告微挫，最後前者為四萬〇七百元，後者三萬九千七百元，與上日午收大致軋平，但較午後塲外喊價則見鬆落。</p>
<p>喇叭童細布三萬九千五百元，終升七百元，其餘各檔細布稍有上落。一九〇高檔士林昨日廠盤接近九萬元大關，為八萬九千元，印花嗶嘰四萬五千元，白貓印布四萬元，大明府綢七萬元。</p>
<h3>中紡拋售紗布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行及美援會昨繼續委託紡建公司在市塲拋紗，共開三次，計售一〇三四件，准購一九六戶，價值九六九，五六〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>各次拋售經過如次：（一）廿支寳船為做開六七七件，們九四萬元，請購九七戶，四六五件，照配。（二）廿支立馬開七百件，價九四萬元，請購九四戶，五三九件，照配。（三）廿支荷心等開三九一件，價八六萬元，請購五戶，卅件，照配。</p>
<p>又紡建公司昨　例售布，共開整布十四種，計售二九六六〇疋，另頭布一種，計售四三二〇〇碼。被單四種，計售七四〇條。以上價值一，一五八，一三六，〇〇〇元。</p>

<h3>奧林匹克女壯元　荷蘭飛將軍柯恩夫人傳</h3>
<p>— 定鑫譯</p>
<p>介紹這位全世界最快的女子，震驚了一九四八年奧林匹克世運會的柯恩夫人。她在家裏，在廚房中，和她的丈夫，兒女在一起，你會覺得她不像一個運動員，她是賢妻良母。</p>
<p>〔本報特稿〕當范婦·柯恩夫人從倫敦奧林匹克大會帶着四塊閃爍璨斕的金脾，回到她祖國的時候，阿姆斯達丹，——這個平日端莊沈寂的海國之都，簡直像瘋狂了一樣。</p>
<p>是八月裏一個秋陽煦照的日子，一輛由四匹白馬曳着的華麗蓬車，載着這位三項世界紀錄的保持者，她的丈夫和她的兩個孩子，從火站緩緩駛向市政府的大禮堂；那裏，市長在等着和這位為國爭光的女英雄握手致賀，成千成萬的羣衆也在等着景仰一下她的音容，一路上，未能擠入大禮堂的累萬人羣，拼命擠在路邊，在陽台，在樓上的窗口，搶着把頭從人頭堆裏伸出來，希望能够得到那怕是不大淸楚和只有幾秒鐘工夫的一瞥。在車上范妮除了是千萬道目光的焦點，千萬隻嗓子集中的標的外，還是一個活動靶子——鮮花的靶子。儘管她七歲的小兒子拼命把一束束落在車上的鮮花還擲出去，范妮還是像站在一輛花車上一樣。</p>
<p>在市政府的大禮堂裏，柯恩夫人僅僅用三句簡單的老實話回答市長先生的頌辭。她說：「我只會跑得快點。我的丈夫，我，和兩個孩子構成一個不過很普通的家庭。大衆之所以這樣熱誠對我，大概為了我的練習和勝利，都是從洗碗補襪的百忙中抽暇完成吧！」</p>
<p>的確，從我和他們在一起過的一個星期中的觀察，他們這家毫無疑問地是萬千歐洲中產階級家庭的典型，——勤儉樸素而又十分剛毅。他們過着極平凡的生活。他們住在一座四層磚屋裏的一所小公寓裏；為配給物品的不够而發愁；讀着書報流通社借來的刋物；打打「橋」牌，和親友們交遊。他們唯一日常生活以外的癖好便是運動。</p>
<p>范妮和她丈夫——詹恩，是相處得很融治的一對。詹恩從前是個銀行職員，現在是荷蘭首都警察局的體育指導。他也是一位田徑名手，得過好幾項錦標。自從一九三五年在跑道上發現范妮的天才時起，他一直是范妮的私人敎練，所以范妮之有今日，半為詹恩之功。他比范妮大十四年零三日，再加上他溫和的外貌，整潔的修飾，使范妮愛之如夫之外，同時又敬之如師。任何宴會，任何邀請，范妮總是以「讓我去問問詹恩」這句話來回答，卽使在最普通的日常談話中，范妮也終以詹恩的意旨為依歸。</p>
<p>儘管他們夫婦倆互相愛慕體貼，但詹恩對教練范妮一點，異常認眞。詹恩的一字褒獎，范妮總是引為殊榮，受寵若驚。去秋倫敦世運范妮得了第三項錦標後，詹恩才破例在范妮臉龐上一吻，祝賀她的驚人成就。這一下還是經攝影記者們苦苦懇求才來的呢！</p>
<p>范妮的雙親都還健在，這兩位魁梧奇偉年近六十的老人每天還在游泳，溜冰，柏網球，整天跑跑跳跳，不見絲毫暮氣。（未完）</p>
<p>（上圖）柯恩夫人到達終點的一剎那，她的十個手指就顯得她那緊張的情緒。（下圖）她和她的丈夫也是她的敎練詹恩合影，壁上懸着許多輝煌的獎章，這是他們倆共同的勳績。</p>
<h3>回力心情緊張　恩卡斯勝半球</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽昨晚回力竟以一分之差慘敗於恩卡斯，結果為四十比卅九。上半時雙方釘得很緊，成十九比十二。恩卡斯泊透昨晚得心應手，大胖子邱區胡亦動若脫兎，兩人悉屬新將，表演殊為出色。番隊主將格朋乞谷夫上半時卽傷手離塲，回力本有可乘之機，惜因過份緊張，最後數分鏡內擲罰俱告失悮，致迭成若此慘局，千餘球迷雖熱烈助威，不免失望而去。另塲甲一組培斐爾勝麥令，五六比卅九。甲二C培爾勝鐵聯，四四比三十。</p>
<p>恩卡斯對回力之戰，恩卡斯上塲者為奧柴遼，沙司金，格朋乞谷夫，泊透，却利勃脫五人。回力則以田福海，王永芳，葉雲山，曹志吉，魏戍迎戰。</p>
<p>開賽後，沙司金先中，一福海繼之，奧與永芳各罰一球，三分平手。魏戍中籃，回力意志堅定；迨格泊添三分，恩卡斯以六比五追出。陳正淼替出永芳後，却利再中，經葉魏努力，九比八回力又見出頭。恩隊大胖子邱區胡替沙司金，勃脫毫不放鬆，泊透居然亦能單手一拍入籃，至此，戰况殊甚緊張。十七比十二時，格朋乞傷手離塲，沙司金重上戰塲，上半時十九比十二。</p>
<p>下半時凱捷密洛夫代沙司金，回力永芳替正淼，泊透人堆中放冷箭，福海連中二球，永芳當仁「不讓」。孰料對手泊透邱區胡亦從容不迫，隨心所欲。回力仍緊緊追隨，魏戍得手時僅差半球（廿八比廿七），奈永芳未罰入，不則早已平手。泊透又半塲遠中，回觀回力雲山運道欠佳，還是老田有福，名副其實，再逼成卅比廿九，仍為一分之差。正淼代魏成，永芳輕騎殺入，州一比卅，回力超過。陳犯規，泊透二罰，沙司金一球，雖志吉報一罰球，然恩卡斯已二分領前。却利罰中，永芳翻身飛起一球，奧柴遼因阻人犯規，王再罰中，頓變卅五平手。一時球塲人聲鼎沸，沙司金沿邊進襲，恩卡斯又多二分，是時距終塲尙存二分鐘，田未擲進，王未罰入，反被洋胖子擲中一球，奧罰得一分，此後曹志吉田福海雖先後增加二球，奈時不我待，恩卡斯卒以四十比卅九一分之差獲勝。</p>

<h3>鐵聯敗於培爾</h3>
<p>甲二C培爾逢鐵聯，初鐵聯形勢優先，迨培爾以九比八超出，恢復原狀。上半時培爾廿五，鐵聯廿一。培爾吳良軍與鐵聯胡同怡均得分獨多。</p>
<p>下半時十分鐘內，鐵聯加油，卅比廿六僅差二球，無奈後勁不繼，終以卅比四十四結束。</p>
<h3>培斐爾勝麥令</h3>
<p>甲一麥令斯戰培斐爾，一個是陸戰隊，一個是海軍，作戰的路道，都是差不多。上塲未久，培斐爾九比四佔先。培斐爾葛萊奇的籃底妙傳，伊卡特的神射，無論擲罰，有投必中，麥令斯難於抬頭，上半時廿七比廿，培斐爾一領前。</p>
<p>休息後麥令窮拼，隊長利斯身高力大，與對方隊長伊卡特天生一對，黑炭勃郞為培隊得分不少，結果五十六比卅九，麥令不敵</p>

<h3>運動塲上　沒有憂愁</h3>
<p>愛迪伊琴是美國體育界的一位名人，他一向被認為一個樂觀者，他曾再三向人指出「運動塲上沒有憂愁」這個事實。</p>
<p>他承認他自己也未嘗沒有被憂愁所糾纏的時候，「但是，」他說：「當我發現憂愁已經迫近我時，我便跑到運動塲上去。一種體換，一次跑步，或一塲球戱就會把憂愁逐走了。」</p>
<p>他解釋着說：「因為在玩的時候特別忙碌，不容你再有任何煩惱。尤其在身體運動得疲倦時，你的精神便會由慣例的悶　獲得解放，這樣，你的精神便具有了一種新的風趣和力量了。」</p>
<h3>運動世界　屢戰屢北　屢北屢戰　影星打球　噱頭好　石揮倒馬桶·張伐怪動作</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫」「又一」籃球隊，雖然球藝不很高明，可是却擁有許多觀衆，原來這籃球隊，是影劇界同志組織起來的，逢到又一隊比賽，球迷影迷不約而同，一起來觀戰，捧塲的因此就多了。不過大部份觀衆對又一籃球隊還不熟悉，茲就記者所知，略為介紹一下：</p>
<p>又一隊的成立，是在去年任月裏，那時「大團圓」在蘭心上演，後台一部份朋友忽然心血來潮，提議集合影劇界同志，組一籃球隊，一聲呼出，爭相附和。儘管其中有幾個籃球規則都沒十分明瞭，然而球隊到底是成立了。</p>
<p>為了求其隨便，他們輕描淡寫地起了「又一」這名字，意思是說不管怎樣，從此世界上又多了一隊籃球隊啦！每次練習或比賽以後，他們又對自已說：又練習過了一次了，又輸了一次啦，又贏了一次啦！</p>
<p>成立後他們又請大公隊隊長蔡連科帮忙指導，果然進步了不少，可惜因為本來工作很緊張，無法分身來好好的磨練。</p>
<p>第四屆全市聯賽開始前，他們在籃委會主席錢旭滄鼓勵之下，毅然參加了申二組的角逐，諺謂：初生之犢不畏虎，又一隊也就是因為有這種大無畏的精神，才能在聯賽一顯身手。</p>
<p>愛好籃球的朋友，原有數十個，但碍於報名規則的限制，只能選出十個來參加聯賽。、</p>
<p>又一籃球隊的顧問是各大電影公司的負責人，他們的領隊是中國演劇社社長陳忠豪，陳君又是中電文華二公司的首要人物，熱心服務，待人和靄忠誠，影劇界仝人都樂與為友。</p>
<p>管理是洪謨，文華公司的導演，每逢比賽，他都到塲策劃助威。</p>
<p>幹事是方伯，影劇界胖子唯一愛玩籃球的同志，每次練習總是頭一個到塲，精神最佳。</p>
<p>隊長張伐頭腦淸晰，搶球撲球，勇猛過人，有時一下怪動作，觀衆贊賞不絕。</p>
<p>後衛金燄是過去未名隊的老將，經騐豐富，身高臂長，具有籃下功夫。</p>
<p>前鋒石揮，投籃時用「倒馬桶」姿態，球運當頭時百倒百進，表演驚人。</p>
<p>衛禹平，任前鋒職，他是又一隊中最着迷的隊員，平時吃飯聊天不忘籃球，彈性足，跳得高，遠射也有一手。</p>
<p>凌之浩，以前是天津聯賽選手，人長得高，籃下球很有把握。</p>
<p>韓非短小精悍，動作機靈，很會偸冷飯，有時遠擲竟會入籃，連他自己都莫明其妙。</p>
<p>賀路是左衛，在重慶時也玩過球，練習很勤。</p>
<p>羅崇洲是攝影師，打籃球是老資格了，鎭靜工夫很好。</p>
<p>佈景師蘇石風，在中學時是籃球健將，雖然身體瘦弱，但埋頭苦練，投籃漸入正常，是又一隊的獲分能手。</p>
<p>王學武，是影劇界的老同志，也是籃壇老將，為又一隊添光不少。</p>
<p>又一隊除了參加四屆聯賽外，常常和別隊作友誼賽，可是，說句不好聽的話，屢戰屢北，然而他們精神好，屢北屢戰，因此觀衆和捧塲者之多，也不亞於滬上盟主華聯。（陳暢）</p>

<h3>官話與循環</h3>
<p>— 旁觀</p>
<p>每讀報載，看見什麼方面大員如省主席或長官之流上任的時候，下車伊始，必發表一篇堂堂的談話，其結語必曰：本人自當首先安定地方秩序，改善人民生活，以解除本省人民的痛苦，云云。</p>
<p>彷彿該省秩序一向混亂，專等他來安定；而該省人民也一向痛苦異常，專等他來解除。但等到走馬燈轉，這位大員又下了台，換上另一位新大員時，新任却又要發表一篇談話，準備來解除前任所治理下的人民的痛苦了。</p>
<p>異哉！究竟是怎麼一回事呢？我要解除你的人民的痛苦，而當他上任時，又要解除我的人民的痛苦了，可見人民的痛苦從未解除，而且也許日益加深。否則，何以每一任新官的第一句話，總是要解除該省人民的痛苦呢？</p>
<p>筆者寒酸，只當個八等文官，沒有做過什麼方面大員，所以也不知道當前任聽見新任說要解除自己治下的人民的痛苦時，是否要覺得刺耳，或疑心新任是有意要拆他的台，暗示你的官做得不好。我想，大概是沒有什麼的，因為自己當時上台的時候，或者官運一轉，又到別的什麼省份去上任的時候，也要說這套話的呀。</p>
<p>我上台時要解除痛苦，你上台時仍要解除痛苦，如此循環不已。官話雖不能照字面看，但老百姓的痛苦之從未解除，則卽使從這句官話裏，也得到親口招認的證據了。</p>
<p>報紙只宜馬虎讀，決不能細看。否則，若在這種地方仔細一想，就不免要令人哭笑不得了。</p>
<h3>好萊塢的結婚代價</h3>
<p>— 秋渠</p>
<p>有人估計，在好萊塢要維持一個妻子，每年須一萬美金。</p>
<p>一年以後，如果要與這位太太離婚，所化就在十萬美金左右</p>
<p>大多數的男明星，現在都拿不出這筆錢。他們的收入，給政府機關或個人經理人抽去了約百分之七十五以後，所剩的也就無幾了。</p>
<p>這筆代價的支配是如此的：第一，你得替她買件皮大衣；第二，她還得有件外套，所有的女人全都有一件的。然後，你再替她買兩件衣裳，一只鑽戒，和一串項練。</p>
<p>你也許得替她買一輛轎式敞式兩用的汽車，讓她可以四處亂跑，在更多的地方化錢。如果她生了孩子的話，你得僱一個保姆。而她則帶着以前的全體女朋友出去吃飯，飯錢當然開在你的賬上。</p>
<p>這就是第一年的開銷，一萬美金。</p>
<p>第一年以後，若干明星就辦好離婚手續，而在其後的十年內，須每年付贍養費一萬美元。於是，他們就另娶一位太太，又是一萬美元。</p>
<p>有一位大明星，在過去兩年中賺了近八十萬美元。但現在，却是身無分文。為什麽呢？因為他須給好幾位離婚的太太分期付瞻養費，前賬未淸，後賬又來。而且，眼前又要替他的女朋友們買東西。如果他能剩一分錢的話，那才是怪事哩。</p>

<h3>暹羅的「警貓」</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>一般人只知道貓會捕鼠，很少有人知道居然還有一種會捕盜的貓，它就是暹羅貓。好幾百年以來，暹羅人一直以貓代替守夜犬，訓練牠們辨認和攻擊盜賊。曼谷的王宮和官邸區，從前一向是由特種的貓巡夜防護的。</p>
<p>這些御貓在「上差」的時候，像哨兵一樣的在崗位附近蹀蹊逡巡，絕不偸懶或跑開。如果有人想爬過牆來，或是掩門私入，牠就從後面悄悄的躡足走上去，猛然的躍上入侵者的背部，用四足長而銳的利爪，緊抓住肩胛骨的下方，這使被抓的人無法用手撩到牠，把牠摔下來。假如有人想這樣做，牠便狺狺咆哮，用尖銳的牙齒狠咬。</p>
<p>暹羅貓的眼睛平常作藍色，當牠發怒的時候變成血紅，臉色也漲紅，這好像是一種心理的武器，有駭退敵人的功效。在暹羅的窮鄕僻壤，以貓代狗的事情也很普通，歹徒看見牠們，同樣的敬而遠之。暹羅貓的聲譽是以事實建立起來的，遠在古代，暹羅兵便把貓當作軍犬帶上戰塲。</p>
<p>暹羅貓的私生活很有趣。牠們是一夫一妻主義的信徒。如果給牠們機會，牠們會選擇自己的配偶，並且終身堅貞不渝。小貓在幼年選中的異性伴侶，常永久不分離，達到成熟時期，牠倆便成了齊眉的伉儷；如果加以隔離，便會憂鬱和頽喪。</p>
<p>貓夫婦喜歡用同一隻碗，一起吃飯。不過，在求愛時期，則常是雄貓先吃，雌貓在一傍等牠吃飽了，才安靜的走上去吃殘羹剩飯。但是，一等到貓太太有了身孕時，這一切就又完全改變了。在雌貓懷孕和哺乳的時期，雄貓總是體恤地讓牠的太太先吃飽。要等到小貓斷乳，貓先生才恢復牠的優先權。</p>
<p>因為暹羅貓有捕盜的特性，成了暹羅的特產，所以有些外國旅客難免要買一兩隻帶回國去，並且都選購尾端打結似的勾曲的貓，因為據說這種貓是道地的御貓。賣貓的土人也總說他們的貓是從宮中偷來的。其實，偸盜御貓是犯死罪的，誰願為了賺小錢而犯重典？但是，尾端勾曲是御貓的特徵，却有一段傳誦人口的故事：</p>
<p>據說，在古代，有一個暹羅王出外去作戰，臨行時他脫下他的魔怪戒子，交給他的妻后保管，告訴她要放在一個安全的地方，以防遺失或被盜。</p>
<p>他出征之後，王后便將魔戒套入她的愛貓的尾巴上，因為她認為這是最安全的地方。為了防免戒子滑脫起見，她就在貓尾上打了一個結。於是‘，這個結就變成永久性的了，這隻王后心愛的御貓的子嗣，都遺傳到這個特殊的畸形，並且成了御貓的標記。</p>
<p>拆穿了說，貓絕不會因為牠們的祖先的尾端被偶然打了一個結，就此子子孫孫的尾端都有結。尾端結狀勾曲的貓並不十分稀罕，形成的原因亦無神秘，不過是因為牠們的尾椎骨的地位和常貓不同一點罷了。</p>
<h3>花神燈</h3>
<p>今日是舊曆二月十二日，卽百花生日</p>
<p>花神燈，俗稱凉傘燈，是老上海過百花生日的應時景物。燈是用一種名「談箋」的紙糊的，但看起來比繭絲還細，上面還縷刻着人物·花卉·珍禽·異獸，精緻異常，栩栩如生。燈為圓形或六角形，幾個角上和下端，還有纓絡鬚帶。出燈時，配着十番鑼鼓，細腰鼓，再加上紙紮的花枝花籃，有時還有臺閣，頗為熱鬧。</p>
<p>在旁的地方，燈市總在元宵節。上海元宵節燈市之外，花朝的燈市也够熱鬧的，且獨得文人雅士之流的讚賞。他們覺得元宵的燈太俗，無所可觀，就轉而推重花朝的花神燈了。</p>

<h3>上海舊話之四　外白渡橋小史</h3>
<p>— 吉齋</p>
<p>從西區中區到虹口，提籃橋一帶，外白渡橋雖不是必經之道，但蘇州河上各橋樑中，自以外白波橋的建築最為堅固堂皇；其所担負的交通責任，亦最為重大。外白波橋的名稱，推想起來，或是「外擺渡橋」的音訛。因為蘇州河上當初橋樑尙未建造之際，兩岸來往，都靠船隻擺渡，河邊有好許多渡頭。最靠近黃浦灘的地方，稱為「外擺渡」，於是在那裏所造的橋，卽構為外擺渡橋，此亦在情理之中。但此橋初浩時，行人車馬經過都是要給錢的，正像搭渡船過河是收錢一樣。到後來，該橋收為公有，不再收什麼買路錢，豈非卽變成了「白渡」。所以稱為「白渡橋」倒也名副其實。</p>
<p>考白渡橋的建造，始於一八五三年，卽咸豐三年。那時有一個英國人名威爾斯者，見蘇州河西岸車馬行人過往頻繁，覺得這筆生意大可一做，便取得上海道和租界當局的特許，組織了一個『威爾斯橋樑公司」，在這裏建造大橋，到一八五六年（咸豐六年）完成，卽定名為威爾斯橋。這是外白渡橋的前身。</p>
<p>這座橋，當然是用木板建造的，除除兩邊橋墩外，中間有吊橋，船隻駛過時拉起吊橋，待過後再放下，讓行人車馬經過</p>
<p>據說，威爾斯造這座橋，化了一萬兩銀子，這在當時是個不小的數目，當然要撈回來，所以凡過往的人，每人每次收錢二文，車馬加倍。但當時有人發覺，凡高鼻子洋人經過，却不見收費，不覺大為不平。同治十一年，卽一八七二年，本報創刋，對於這不平的事實，曾有好幾篇短文評述，今日藏報中尙可見得，。各公所為了抵制外國人的不公，準備購置義渡數隻，免費供華人過渡，看外白渡橋還會有什麼生意。工部局方面見情形不好，只得來轉圜，說：外國人一向也出錢，而且出得更多，要每次十文。不過因為外國人出外大都不慣帶零錢，所以這筆錢是由工部局到月底彙總付的，云云。是眞是假，也就無法考查了。</p>
<p>無論如何，由於義渡之設，威爾斯橋的生意，巳大見淸淡了。到同治十三年（一八七四）終於由工部局出價收買了。</p>
<p>但一座木橋，用了這許多年，當然也亟須修理了。工部局方面鑒於該橋的日趨重要，決心要把它重換橋墩，改築鋼橋·這事是由當時的工部局工務處主任梅恩負責籌劃的。梅恩為了要精確計算橋面的載重力，特在光緒十五年（一八八九）六月十四，十五，十六三天中，派多人整日坐守兩邊橋頭，仔細統計過往的車馬行人之數。據後來發表，是如此：</p>
<p>馬車　一·六三三三輛</p>
<p>黃包車　二〇·九五八輛</p>
<p>貨車　二二輛</p>
<p>小車　二·七五九輛</p>
<p>轎子　二七乘</p>
<p>馬　三八匹</p>
<p>步行西人　一·六四五名</p>
<p>步行華人　三三·六六六名</p>
<p>上面的統計雖不見得完全精確，但想必相去不遠。於此也可想見當時外白渡橋上的交通情形是如何了。外白渡橋的改建工作，到光緒三十二年（一九〇六）才正式進行，次年完成。橋身完全鋼質，係由英國克利扶蘭鋼鐵公司听造。近四十年來，雖也時有小修理，但大體不變。如去年，卽因橋東墩基受百老匯大廈的長期重壓，與橋身間發生隙縫，曾由工務局進行修補。</p>

        <h1>1949.03.11</h1>
<h3>He Yingqin Receives Mandate to Form New Cabinet; Acting President Li's Letter to be Submitted to Legislative Yuan Today; Shao Hong Rumored to be Vice President</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It is learned that Acting President Li has invited He Yingqin to serve as the new Premier of the Executive Yuan. Although He has repeatedly expressed his humility, after careful consideration, he no longer firmly declines. According to sources close to Acting President Li on the evening of the 10th, He has agreed to serve as the new Premier of the Executive Yuan and may fly back to Nanjing from Hangzhou on the 11th or 12th. This was decided in a long-distance telephone call between Nanjing and Hangzhou on the 10th. Barring other changes, Acting President Li's letter nominating the new Premier of the Executive Yuan for approval by the Legislative Yuan is expected to be delivered to the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 11th. Relevant personnel refused to disclose on the evening of the 11th who was nominated in the letter. However, according to general speculation, the nominee is likely He Yingqin.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 10th] Hangzhou experienced rain and wind on the 10th. General He Yingqin quietly resided at Tang Mansion in the West Lake area and did not go out all day. When our reporter visited him to inquire about the formation of the cabinet, he smiled and told the reporter that he was a soldier and did not meddle in politics, and he really dared not take on such a difficult task. Although Acting President Li had called him in Hangzhou, he replied that sending an airplane would also be useless. He also said that he had heard that Acting President Li had sent Gan Jiehou and Qiu Changwei to Hangzhou, but he had not met them yet. He might consider traveling elsewhere recently and would not return to Nanjing for the time being. When discussing the issue of peace and war, he said that after the victory of the War of Resistance, he had devoted himself to international peace work. He had always hoped for domestic peace, but it required both sides to have genuine sincerity. If the fighting continues for a long time, the vitality of the country will be exhausted, and the country will be pushed back several decades. If he needs to participate in the peace work, he is obliged to do so. He was quite fond of Hangzhou. While talking to the reporter, he frequently looked at the scenery of the lake and mountains in the mist outside the window. Xuan Tiewu accompanied him, having been showing He around the famous historical sites in recent days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The fourth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 11th. At that time, proposals will still be discussed in accordance with the agenda. However, if Acting President Li's letter nominating the Premier of the Executive Yuan arrives on the 11th, it will be reported at the plenary session that day and changed to a vote of approval, so as to quickly approve the candidate for the new Premier of the Executive Yuan and facilitate the early formation of the new Executive Yuan. However, as of the evening of the 10th, the Legislative Yuan had not yet received the Presidential Office's letter of nomination.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] An authoritative source spoke to reporters on the evening of the 10th about the procedure for the President to nominate the Premier of the Executive Yuan, saying: "The President's nomination of candidates for Premier of the Executive Yuan and request for the Legislative Yuan's approval is a power granted to the President by the Constitution. However, party politics and parliamentary politics are intertwined. If the nominee is a party member, according to general practice and the Kuomintang's tradition, it should first be proposed and passed in the Central Standing Committee, and then the Legislative Yuan should be consulted for approval. Although the number of KMT Central Standing Committee members in the Nanjing and Shanghai area is sufficient for a quorum, the Central Party Headquarters has already moved to Guangzhou, and the Standing Committee should be held in Guangzhou. Unless consent is first obtained from Guangzhou, the Central Standing Committee should not be held in Nanjing. This time, Premier Sun Ke resigned at a time when the country is facing the most difficult times. In order to prevent government affairs from being interrupted for a long time, Acting President Li may seek the consent of all parties concerned in advance and immediately consult the Legislative Yuan for approval, and then complete the formalities of approval by the Central Standing Committee, so as to be swift. Therefore, if Acting President Li has obtained the consent of the parties concerned, then the move of directly consulting the Legislative Yuan is also an appropriate measure."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 10th] Reliable sources: After General Zhang Zhizhong returned from Xikou today, he will immediately fly to Hangzhou by special plane to urge General He Yingqin to accept the mandate to form a cabinet.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 10th] Reliable sources: It is rumored that Huang Shao-hong has been internally appointed as the Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan, and Qiu Changwei is expected to serve as the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. News this evening indicates that He's appointment as Premier is practically a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Li Huang, leader of the Youth Party, arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the morning of the 10th. At 5:00 pm, he went to Chuanhougang to meet Acting President Li to exchange views on the current situation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Li Huang traveled by train from Shanghai to Nanjing the night before last at the invitation of Acting President Li to discuss the cabinet formation and peace talks. After the new cabinet is formed, the Youth Party will be invited to participate. It is learned that Li Huang may join the cabinet, but whether he is willing to take on actual responsibilities is still unknown.</p>

<h3>Former Cabinet Leaders Arrive in Shanghai; Immediately Fly to Guangzhou for Handover; Sun Ke to Leave Nanjing in Two or Three Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Minister of Water Resources Zhong Tianxin, Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weizhi, and Minister of Land Administration Wu Shangying arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. They will fly to Guangzhou in a day or two to handle handover matters. Premier Sun will also come to Shanghai and transfer to Guangzhou within two or three days to handle the handover work of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Wu Tiecheng is scheduled to take the night train to Shanghai on the 11th. After staying in Shanghai for one or two days, he will fly from Shanghai to Guangzhou to rush to handle handover matters. Feng Zong'e, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had already taken the night train to Shanghai on the 10th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 10th] After the resignation of Sun's cabinet, several legislators here close to Sun said that their arrival in Guangzhou was not at the invitation of Premier Sun, but was notified by Speaker Tong. They were not surprised by the resignation of Sun's cabinet, believing that this was because Sun's cabinet advocated honorable peace and was opposed by others, so resignation was inevitable. A cabinet resigning because its proposals cannot be implemented is the most common thing. As for their current whereabouts, it is said that if the Legislative Yuan decides to move back to Nanjing, the Guangzhou office will move back under orders. Whether colleagues remain in Guangzhou or go to Nanjing is not mandatory under the Constitution, but this is entirely a matter of personal position and has nothing to do with political views. One legislator said that what he is most concerned about is the delay between the resignation of the old cabinet and the formation of the new cabinet, which will cause great losses to the country. There are still more than 60 legislators remaining in Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Central Standing Committee</h3>
<p>Insufficient Number of Members, Change to Discussion Meeting</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee was originally scheduled to hold its fourth meeting in Guangzhou on the 10th. Due to the insufficient number of Central Standing Committee members remaining in Guangzhou to meet the quorum, it was temporarily changed to a discussion meeting.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke on the Political Situation</h3>
<p>Little Hope of Preventing Communist Party Rule; Believes New Cabinet Will Face More Difficulties</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 10th] Former Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, in a solo interview with an Associated Press reporter on the 10th, believes that there is little hope of preventing the Communist Party from ruling China through negotiations or war. He warned: "A Communist-ruled China will be linked to the Soviet Union in a global East-West conflict, which is an inevitable result." Sun believes that most of the responsibility for the current situation of the Kuomintang lies in President Chiang's failure to make peace with the Chinese Communist Party when General Marshall came to China for mediation, and in the global "Cold War" between the United States and the Soviet Union. He predicts that the new cabinet, which will be formed soon, will encounter "more difficulties" than his cabinet encountered.</p>
<p>Sun Ke denied that President Chiang, after his retirement, had issued "any formal or direct orders" to any government agency, but admitted that "many former subordinates of President Chiang often consulted him, which was often regarded as orders." Sun also said that he himself had never contacted Chiang by telephone, telegram, or other means. Sun Ke, based on his long experience in the government, said: "The main responsibility for plunging the government into the current situation lies in President Chiang's failure to accept some kind of agreement with the Chinese Communist Party when the War of Resistance had just ended. Even a temporary agreement at that time could have helped rebuild the country's economic and military strength." He added: "Of course, this cannot be entirely blamed on President Chiang; it was also caused by mutual distrust and suspicion. The collapse of the Kuomintang was also due to the Cold War between East and West. The wavering of the United States' policy towards China is also related to this."</p>
<p>"A Communist-controlled China, unless the Communist Party changes its aims, unless the Communist Party knows the benefits of accepting ECA aid, unless they are more Chinese and less Communist, will inevitably join the Soviet bloc. This is a foregone conclusion." He suggested that "to avoid this possibility, the government should insist on strict neutrality in international politics in future peace talks, as well as the freedom of the people's way of life." He believes that these two points are the most important in any future agreement with the Chinese Communist Party. He explained that China has suffered enough in the War of Resistance and the Civil War, "and really cannot bring about another disaster." Sun Ke continued, "The foreign policy of the future coalition government should not involve any future global conflicts that are not directly related to China, such as the German question and the Atlantic Treaty issue." He believes that the Chinese Communist Party is very likely to agree to this in the peace talks.</p>
<p>Regarding the free way of life, Sun Ke continued, "Unless the peaceful resolution contains effective guarantees of democratic rights, especially the right to choose a profession, there will be no satisfactory peaceful resolution." "Of course, some organizations are necessary, but the organization should not be totalitarian."</p>
<p>Commenting on the legislators' launch of a rejection of US aid, Sun said: "This is just a move to please the Chinese Communist Party."

The commentary pointed out that Acting President Li had invited Bai Chongxi, Stuart, and General Barr to a meeting on the 7th, and that Bai Chongxi had obtained Li Zongren's dispatch of representatives to the United States "to establish close contact with American warlords."</p>

<h3>Naval Headquarters Orders Yangtze River Defense Fleet</h3>
<p>Strictly Prevent Communist Army from Crossing the River Warships Patrol Various Ports Day and Night</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] According to the military news agency, in order to prevent the Communist army's attempt to cross the Yangtze River, the Naval Headquarters has ordered the Yangtze River Defense Fleet to cooperate closely with the army and air force, and dispatch warships to patrol various ports along the Yangtze River day and night to enhance the river defense.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 10th] Military news: (1) A unit of Communist cavalry arrived west of Yangzhou yesterday. (2) On the 8th, three regiments of a Communist army unit were transferred south along the Taixian Kou-Tai Line, one of which had advanced to the area south of Diaojiapu yesterday. (3) The Communist army is currently collecting horse grass and feed from households in Yangzhou, 150 catties per household. (4) The Communist army is currently supervising the repair of the Yang (Zhou) Yi (Zheng) Highway, and is also mass-assembling wooden rafts on the canal line, building small defensive works on them, and equipping them with motors.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 10th] According to a notice issued by a senior military agency to the troops stationed here, the Fourth, Ninth, and Thirteenth Columns of the Communist army may also be transferred to northern Jiangsu. The military here has not been able to confirm this, but it is firmly believed that the number of Communist army units transferred south is definitely more than the three columns of the Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth that have been discovered so far. According to former Nationalist army prisoners, a part of the Communist army in southern Shandong is transferring south towards northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 10th] A telegram from Zhenjiang stated that the Nationalist army had withdrawn from the Liuxu bridgehead on the north bank and crossed the river to increase the defense on the south bank. Only some local troops remained to guard Liuxu.</p>

<h3>Principles of Military Reform Have Been Determined</h3>
<p>Striving for Streamlined Troops is the Goal Deng Wenyi Says Conscription System Will Not Be AbolISHED</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Ministry of National Defense has been discussing the issue of military reform for several days, but has not yet made a final decision. Deng Wenyi, spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, said on the 10th that four principles of the military reform plan have been determined: (1) Striving for streamlined troops is the biggest goal, and we are going all out; (2) Verifying the number of troops and not allowing any more vacancies; (3) Implementing three public disclosures, namely personnel disclosure, financial disclosure, and opinion disclosure (lower-level cadres and soldiers can express their opinions on the troops); (4) Streamlining senior command agencies and reducing unnecessary ones. Deng said that the conscription system is common in countries around the world, and China cannot abolish it alone. The past conscription system was bad and full of abuses. In the future, it should be improved, and both conscription and recruitment systems should be implemented. The opposition to conscription by local senates is unreasonable and unrealistic.</p>
<h3>Answering Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>When answering reporters' questions, Deng said: (1) The Yangtze River blockade is a blockade against the north bank, and the blockade date will be decided by the local authorities. Yangtze River shipping can still pass. (2) In recent months, 14 local units have withdrawn from the north bank of the Yangtze River to the south bank, as well as some security forces, without adequate funding and poor discipline. They are now being reorganized into seven columns by Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo. (3) There is no way to verify the claim that Lin Biao's troops are moving south on a large scale. (4) It is unknown where the Chongqing ship is now, and the air force has not bombed it. (5) According to unofficial information obtained, the numbers and commanders of the troops under Fu Zuoyi that were reorganized by the Chinese Communist Party in Beiping below the division level have not changed. The units have been transferred away from the vicinity of Beiping and are said to be heading to Chahar and Rehe.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Cross the Huai River, Attack Luoshan but are Repelled</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 10th] Communist troops in Xiangcheng, Xincai, Zhoujiakou and other places in southeastern Henan have been frequently mobilizing in recent days. A portion of them have already crossed the Huai River in Xixian County and attacked Luoshan. Currently, National Army forces are strengthening their defenses along the Xinyang to Luoshan highway.</p>
<p>[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 9th] The vanguard of Liu Bocheng's communist troops, numbering over a thousand, who had advanced to the border of Huangchuan County, forcibly crossed the Huai River on the morning of the 9th and entered Luoshan County. They were met with a counterattack by National Army forces. The communist troops were unable to withstand the assault and fled back to Huangchuan. There are still approximately five communist regiments in Huangchuan County. Furthermore, the communist troops moving south from southeastern Henan continued to enter Runan County from Shenqiu, Xiangcheng, Shangshui, and Xincai on the 9th, with intentions to flee towards Qichun in eastern Hubei. Their goal may be to coordinate with the communist troops in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in their crossing. Currently, the National Army forces in Wuxue, Tianjiazhen, and Qichun in eastern Hubei are strong and well-prepared.</p>
<p>[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 9th] The communist troops have recently been forcibly conscripting soldiers and grain in the Tongbai, Tanghe, and Nanyang areas. Each 保 (bao, unit of administration) is required to provide 140 able-bodied men, 400 dan (unit of weight) of grain, and 1,500 yuan in cash. This has caused unbearable hardship for the people in the fifteen counties of southwestern Henan, who have spontaneously organized Red Spear Societies to resist. Within a week, their numbers have increased from 5,000 to over 70,000, creating a formidable force. In addition to a portion that has already attacked Tongbai County, another group of four to five thousand have advanced to the border of Biyang County, and the county seat may also be captured.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Expedite a Solution to the Xiangxi Incident</h3>
<p>While the communist troops are massing on the banks of the Yangtze River, and the entire nation's attention is focused on the political situation in the Jiangnan region, a major incident has suddenly occurred in Xiangxi, south of the Yangtze River, and is still spreading and expanding. The Hunan Provincial Assembly has been meeting for days to discuss countermeasures to the Xiangxi incident, urging local authorities to be vigilant and not underestimate it as a local matter, neglecting defenses. General Cheng Qian, Pacification Director of Changsha and Chairman of Hunan Province, is currently detained in Nanjing due to important official business. The Provincial Assembly has sent a telegram urging him to return quickly to maintain order. General Li Mo'an, military leader of Xiangxi, is also detained in Changsha and has not returned. The Provincial Assembly has also urged him to return to his defense area to take responsibility for resolving the situation, to prevent it from escalating. It is also heard that people from Hunan residing in Nanjing and Shanghai are placing great importance on the Xiangxi incident and have been holding gatherings, believing the area of the rebellion is expanding and the situation is serious. They have been urging Acting President Li and Director Cheng to pay attention to it and quickly devise solutions, so as not to nurture a festering sore that leads to an irreparable situation.</p>
<p>This Xiangxi incident is an armed rebellion that has combined bandits, security forces, and local people. It began in the latter part of last month and has, to this day, successively disrupted the county seats of Yongshun, Baojing, Longshan, Mayang, Chenxi, Yuanling, and other counties. The rebel forces are further threatening Qiancheng to the west, pressing Zhijiang to the south, pointing to Shupu to the east, and heading north towards Changde, an important town in western Hunan. They have also declared that they will temporarily halt military actions after attacking Changde, demonstrating that the rebels' actions are purposeful and planned. The causes of the Xiangxi incident are very complex. In the long term, it is due to the lack of restoration in Xiangxi after the war, the poverty of the people, the exhaustion of resources, and the failure to provide relief, coupled with the rampant corruption of local officials who exploited the good people. In the current chaotic situation, all these problems have finally erupted and become unmanageable. In the short term, it is due to the recent urgent recruitment of soldiers and expansion of the army in Hunan, and the province's desire to reorganize the security teams and police, leading to instability among the teams and police. It is also rumored that General Li Mo'an, Pacification Commander, did not handle the situation appropriately, resorting to military force to suppress and encircle the good people, thereby exacerbating the situation. At the beginning of the incident, the provincial government decided to implement both suppression and appeasement, but in practice, emphasized suppression. The Provincial Assembly recognized the incident was not strongly political in nature and unanimously advocated guidance, even sending representatives with the provincial government to Yuanling to negotiate with the rebel leaders, hoping for unity among the people of Hunan and resolving all local issues through political means. However, the negotiations in Yuanling failed, and a great fire broke out in the city, reducing half of its essence to ashes! The reason for the breakdown of negotiations, according to the "Xiangxi People's Anti-Oppression Committee" in a telegram to Tang Boqiu, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, and Senator He Sanwei, was that Li Mo'an "instigated his special service regiment to enter Chenling, resisting our army on the one hand, and looting Yuanling on the other, which was a tragic sight. We implore you to request Chairman Cheng to detain him." It is also heard that the rebels in Yuanling put forward three conditions: (1) Replace Li Mo'an, (2) Self-determination for the people of Xiangxi, and (3) Establishment of two divisions in Xiangxi. The attitude of General Li Mo'an, who is detained in Changsha, also emphasizes a political solution and denies oppressing the people of Xiangxi.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we believe that the Xiangxi incident, up to now, does not have a strong political color and can be seen as an event of conflicting interests between local officials and the people. The creation of this incident is of course due to the lack of political clarity, poor human planning, and the people being forced to rebel. If the true nature of the event is indeed as such, without other political factors permeating it, this event may be resolved soon. However, if the authorities only know how to delay and evade, then long nights lead to many dreams, and there is no guarantee that the rebellion will not expand. If it spreads from Xiangxi to the entire Hunan province, and from the border of Hunan to the southwest, then it will be unmanageable. This is what we must particularly raise awareness of today!</p>
<p>As is well known, Hunan's position south of the Yangtze River today is very important. Gu Zuyu said in "Record of Historical Geography": "Huguang is located in the center of eight provinces, the most closed and expansive, with mountains and rivers that are dangerously solid, and has been called Xiongwu since ancient times. To cross Guangdong, one relies on Chenzhou and Yongzhou; to defend Yunnan and Guizhou, one relies heavily on Changde and Yuanling." Defending Hunan secures the southeast; securing Hunan strengthens the southwest. The situation of our country's eight-year war of resistance against Japan fully proves the importance of Hunan's position. Hunan is truly the arm and finger of the east, west, and south. When discussing Hunan's strategic importance, one must especially value Xiangxi. Xiangxi borders Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, with overlapping mountains and hills, and a mixture of Miao and Yao peoples. It has been a difficult area to govern since ancient times. During the war of resistance, Xiangxi alone resisted the Japanese invaders, blocking them from crossing into Guizhou and Sichuan. This demonstrates that Xiangxi's situation allows it to defend and protect itself. The foundation for the victory of the War of Resistance can almost be said to have been laid in Xiangxi. The wartime provincial government was established in Yuanling, and the surrender ceremony in Zhijiang, where the National Army advanced directly from Xiangxi to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, further illustrates the importance of Xiangxi's position. How can it be ignored? Unfortunately, this incident occurred in Xiangxi, the base of the war of resistance, and is spreading and expanding daily. It is something that should be paid attention to.</p>
<p>In order to rescue Xiangxi and resolve the Xiangxi incident, we strongly agree with the Hunan Provincial Assembly's proposal to handle local events in a guiding manner, to achieve a peaceful resolution quickly, to cut the Gordian knot, to calm the people, and not to procrastinate and delay! Director Cheng is responsible for the safety of Hunan. He should return to Hunan to maintain order as soon as possible, and with great wisdom and courage, peacefully handle the Xiangxi incident and thoroughly eliminate the factors that led to its outbreak. The central government's major plan for peace talks is being led by Acting President Li, and there is no need to stay in the capital any longer. If Director Cheng can resolve the Xiangxi incident in a very short period of time, it will help the peace talks and benefit the country. Otherwise, if the situation expands, it will not only be unfortunate for Hunan, but also not a blessing for the country. We hope the authorities in Hunan pay attention to this!</p>
<h3>The Xiangxi Incident Takes a Sharp Turn: Rebels Withdraw from Yuanling to Await Reorganization, Cheng Qian Scheduled to Return to Hunan Today to Oversee the Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 10th] The Xiangxi incident has taken a sharp turn. Cao Zhenya's rebel forces in Yuanling have accepted the government's orders and withdrew from Yuanling City at 4 p.m. on the 9th. They will first concentrate in Yongshun to await inspection and reorganization into the 5th Security Brigade. Wang Yuanhua will serve as brigade commander, and Cao Zhenya as deputy. Wang will also serve concurrently as the commander for the suppression of Yongshun and Longshan, while Cao will concurrently serve as the commander of the 1st Regiment. Zhang Dazhi and Zhang Yulin, leaders of the rebels who captured Chenxi, will also be appointed as the 2nd and 3rd Regiment commanders of Wang's brigade, respectively. Furthermore, according to official sources, Zhu's battalion of Wang Yuanhua's 10th Security Regiment, stationed in Dayong, never acted recklessly. The government will commend them. Zhang's battalion, although involved in the rebellion and stationed in Chenxi, has also expressed its allegiance and is awaiting government orders. As of now, the Xiangxi incident is trending towards moderation. Future developments will depend on the technical aspects of the reorganization.</p>
<p>[Additional Dispatch] Yuanling fell on the 1st and Wang Jinxiu, deputy commander of the security forces, led his troops in to comfort the refugees on the 10th, a total of 10 days.

Acting President Li hosted a luncheon for Cheng at his official residence on the 10th, and invited Bai Chongxi and others to accompany them. Cheng was originally scheduled to stay in Nanjing for several more days, but due to the recent serious banditry in Xiangxi, various circles in Changsha sent telegrams urging Cheng to return to Hunan to oversee the situation as soon as possible, so he decided to return early.</p>

<h3>Tang Enbo Hosts Publishing Industry, Hopes for Six Principles of Speech, The Peace Talks Issue Should Be Based on Non-Violation of Equality, To Assist Cultural and Educational Work Decides to Establish Cultural and Educational Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Report] General Tang Enbo, Commander of the Garrison in Nanjing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, held a tea party at the New Life Club yesterday afternoon to host people from the publishing, cultural, and news circles in this city. He announced the six principles he hopes for regarding various newspaper and periodical opinions: (1) In the future, newspaper articles on the issue of peace talks should be based on the principle of peace that does not violate comprehensive equality and is reasonable. (2) Preparing for war while seeking peace is the established national policy of the government. No newspaper article may publish words that slander, satirize, or violate this national policy. (3) Speech should be accurate and fair, and should not undermine unity, provoke discord, create division, or harm the country. (4) News reports should be based on facts and should not fabricate something out of nothing, spread rumors, or mislead the public. Various telegrams and communications must be carefully published and used with discretion. (5) It is strictly forbidden to leak military secrets and disseminate propaganda that insults the government. (6) Newspapers and periodicals should jointly encourage and assist in maintaining治安 (zhian, public order) in this area, protecting social order, and promoting military-civilian cooperation.</p>
<p>Reactionary Speech and Actions Will Be Severely Sanctioned</p>
<p>Tang pointed out that public opinion on the issue of war and peace is currently very inconsistent. Some people advocate seeking peace without war, believing that preparing for war is an obstacle to peace, demanding that the government cancel conscription and grain requisition, and reject American aid. However, preparing for war while seeking peace, and building strength to seek equal peace, is the established national policy of the government. Everyone has equal rights and freedom, and there is no reason to give them up and be dominated by others. Seeking peace without war is surrender, that is, being dominated by others. Currently, it is very difficult for the communist party to cross the Yangtze River militarily, so they are launching a "political," "economic," and "organizational" crossing first. Those who advocate seeking peace without war are unwittingly falling into the communist party's conspiracy and helping the communist party. Such reactionary speech and actions will be severely sanctioned. Tang also said that although the government is currently suffering setbacks, it is not absolutely without a solution. The struggle with the communist party is part of an international issue. From all aspects, we still have a bright future. He hopes that opinion leaders will help fight for equal freedom and peace. In addition, all speech should have its limits. All reporters, both Chinese and foreign, should abide by them and not make reports that are detrimental to the country and the local area. Foreign reporters can be forgiven because they do not understand our national conditions, but it is hoped that they will be particularly cautious when reporting. In order to assist the cultural and educational work in Nanjing, Shanghai and Hangzhou in the future, this headquarters has decided to establish a Cultural and Educational Committee, which will be headed by Fang Zhi, Director of the City Party Department. It is hoped that all parties will cooperate with it.</p>
<p>War Cannot Be Fought by One Side Alone, Peace Cannot Be Made by One Side Alone</p>
<p>More than a hundred people from the publishing and cultural circles attended the reception yesterday, including Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, Yan Duhe, Fan Zhengbo, Fang Zhi, and Cao Jun. Before Commander Tang gave the above speech, Cheng Cangbo, Pan Gongzhan, and Fan Zhengbo spoke successively, and Fan Xuejun performed a 彈唱 (tanchang, ballad singing with plucked string instrument) to add to the enjoyment. Cheng Cangbo had just returned from the capital and reported that the capital's current situation had stabilized much more. Pan Gongzhan vehemently criticized those who opposed preparing for war and seeking peace, pointing out that war cannot be fought by one side alone, and peace cannot be made by one side alone. He advocated that the city defense works in this city should still be completed as quickly as possible before a secure guarantee of peace is obtained, rather be prepared and not use it. Pan also expressed his deep disgust with the distorted reporting of a few foreign reporters, especially regarding the various rumors after President Chiang's retirement, which were particularly unreasonable. Therefore, he advocated that foreign reporters should be equally restricted and not exceed the limits. Fan Zhengbo hoped that receptions could be held frequently in the future so that everyone could exchange ideas together. Tang immediately accepted this suggestion. The tea party did not break up until around 5 p.m.</p>
<h3>Subsidies for Provinces and Cities: Ministry of Finance Approves Advance Allocation</h3>

<h3>Expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Area: Decision to Enlist Italy, Portugal, and Denmark; Five Western European Countries Met in London Yesterday; Final Review of the Treaty Draft</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Washington, 10th, Radio Broadcast: According to reliable sources, the date and location for signing the North Atlantic Treaty will be decided at tomorrow's meeting. The Danish Foreign Minister will visit Acheson tomorrow but may not attend the meeting. The full text of the draft will be submitted to the Italian government for review after the meeting. It is widely believed that the Danish government will approve the treaty's provisions by the middle of next week, but the attitudes of Iceland and Portugal remain unknown.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] Authoritative sources stated on the 10th that the British Cabinet has approved the Atlantic Treaty draft in principle, and formal approval is merely a formality. European foreign ministers are expected to travel to Washington at the end of this month for the signing ceremony, which coincides with the opening date of the second half of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly at Lake Success.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] The Atlantic Treaty draft stipulates that if any signatory's ships, aircraft, or territory within the security zone are attacked, the signatories will take collective action. This point was revealed by authoritative sources on the 10th as the eight countries drafting the treaty await Italy, Portugal, Denmark, and Iceland to join the treaty. It is said that the procedures for enlisting these countries will be the same as those for Norway. An invitation will be issued immediately upon receiving a formal request to join. The decision to welcome Italy as a fundamental signatory to the treaty came as a surprise. Britain and France advocated for Italy's inclusion, while other countries were lukewarm.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] After receiving the full text of the Atlantic Treaty draft from Washington yesterday, the British Foreign Office convened a full Cabinet meeting today to discuss it. Diplomatic circles expect the British Cabinet's approval to be virtually certain. If the seven governments of the treaty—the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Canada—approve the full text of the draft before next Tuesday, the full text of the treaty is expected to be released next Wednesday.

At the same time, the five Western European Union countries have invited Italy, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Ireland to send observers to the meeting of the five Western European Union countries to be held in London on Monday. Diplomatic circles attach great importance to this meeting, as its success would mean Europe's approval of the Atlantic Treaty. As the treaty has undergone lengthy discussions in Washington, it is expected that this London meeting will be swift and smooth.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Supreme Soviet Council: Stalin Personally Present from the Dais; Cabinet Restructuring to Strengthen Ties with Satellite States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 10th] The first meeting of the Supreme Soviet Council of the Soviet Union since 1946 grandly opened this morning at the Kremlin.

<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 9th] According to information received by political figures here, the Soviet Union's key defense cabinet has been reorganized under the direct command of former Foreign Minister Molotov. Molotov's responsibility is to ensure long-term connections between the Soviet Union and its Eastern European neighbors in terms of industry and armaments. This action by the Soviet Union demonstrates its deep shock and unease at the progress of the Marshall Plan and the recent active progress of the Atlantic Treaty. It is generally expected that the first task of the reorganized Soviet defense cabinet will be to convene a meeting of military leaders and their political and intelligence advisors from Eastern and Central European countries. It is rumored that the meeting will be held in Hungary soon. Some believe that the next step will be to recall Soviet ambassadors stationed in its satellite states to inform them of the actions the Soviet Union plans to take to counter the expansion of Western powers in Scandinavia. At the same time, they will instruct each satellite state to increase electricity production.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Dublin, 9th] Irish Prime Minister Costello told this agency today that we have previously stated that we will not participate in the Atlantic Treaty unless our national unification is restored.

Otherwise, Ireland cannot accept the constraints of the Atlantic Treaty.</p>

<h3>Philippine Representative Romulo Criticizes the Netherlands: Violating Security Council Resolutions; Demands That All Countries Pay Attention to the Consequences of the Hague Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 10th, Radio Broadcast: Lake Success Dispatch: Philippine Representative Romulo issued a warning while the Security Council was discussing the Indonesian issue, requesting that all countries pay attention to the consequences of the round table conference convened by the Netherlands in The Hague. Romulo stated that although the round table conference is a new tactic by the Dutch side, the Netherlands' aim remains consistent: to disregard the Security Council's resolutions, to negotiate peacefully if possible, and to resort to war when necessary, doing as they please and disregarding good faith.</p>
<p>Romulo stated: Six weeks ago, the Dutch representative made a sacred promise to this council, saying that Indonesian leaders would be released immediately, but they subsequently went back on their word. The President and Prime Minister of Indonesia are still detained on Bangka Island. Romulo also accused the Dutch side of obstructing the work of the United Nations Military Mediation Committee, while Indonesia has always respected the resolutions of the United Nations. Romulo then presented the proposal by the 19 Far Eastern countries regarding the resolution of the Indonesian issue, requesting that the Security Council discuss it.

<h3>The Netherlands Publicly Denies: The Claim of Restoring the Indonesian Government</h3>
<p>Rumors that Britain is Applying Pressure to the Netherlands</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] Dutch Chief Representative to the United Nations Van Dongen declared today that the Dutch government believes it cannot comply with the Security Council's instructions to restore the Indonesian Republic's leaders to power. He will explain this matter at the Security Council meeting this afternoon. He firmly believes that if Indonesian leaders are released, they will immediately seize the opportunity to launch sabotage and intensify guerrilla warfare. Although the Netherlands hopes for the independence of all of Indonesia, it does not want this independence to be as chaotic as that of Burma. There is no basis to the rumor that the Dutch side has allowed Indonesian leaders to return to Yogyakarta. He spoke by phone with his Foreign Minister Steik last night, confirming that the government's position has not changed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] The New York Times reported that the British government is pressuring the Dutch government through its diplomatic representatives to make concessions so that the Indonesian Republic can attend the Dutch-Indonesian round table conference in The Hague.

<h3>Washington Rumors that Within Six to Nine Months: MacArthur Will Retire from Japan; The Military Control System in Japan Will Be Changed to a Civilian System</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] According to authoritative sources on the 9th, the United States plans to place Japan under civilian control within six to nine months, no longer under military control, and to reduce the troops stationed in Japan from an administrative nature to a garrison force. Top-level officials believe that this action will be issued simultaneously with MacArthur's retirement. The source emphasized that changing military control to civilian control under the State Department does not mean that US troops stationed in Japan will be reduced. On the contrary, the strength of US troops stationed in Japan will be increased by 20,000 this year. When the State Department takes over the military control from the Department of the Army, US troops stationed in Japan will relinquish administrative duties and focus on garrison activities, similar to the situation of US troops in the Philippines before the war. At that time, the United States maintained a powerful army in the Philippines, under the control of a civilian governor. The strength of some of the increased troops stationed in Japan will be drawn from South Korea. Currently, there are 7,500 US troops in South Korea, who are there at the request of the new South Korean government to maintain order. It is generally believed that US troops stationed in Korea will be transferred to Japan this year. Well-informed sources said that due to the resignation of Under Secretary of the Army Draper and Secretary of the Army Royal's brewing resignation, it is easier to achieve the change of military control in Japan to civilian control. This change has been brewing here for a long time but was opposed by Draper and Royal and was not implemented.</p>

Eichel stated that as far as the occupation army officials here are concerned, there is no fact to support the claim from Washington that occupation affairs will be transferred to civilians, and the army will only be placed in a garrison position. He said: "If there is such a thing, we would be happy to disclose it, as this matter is of general interest." At the same time, he said that such news should be considered "purely speculative." He said that MacArthur would not answer individual inquiries on this broad issue. United Press had requested MacArthur to explain in writing on the morning of the 10th.</p>

Professor Heisenberg, a Nobel laureate and director of the wartime German Atomic Research Institute, said that Soviet scientists may have made "dangerous discoveries" in the field of "death rays."</p>
<p>Heisenberg said that information leaked from the Iron Curtain supports the belief that the Soviet Union is manufacturing atomic weapons in the special industrial centers of Atomgrad and Oozita, located southwest of Irkutsk, the capital of Siberia, and east of the Ural Mountains. The German scientist said that Soviet atomic research is "very secret," but information leaked from Eastern Europe is enough to make him believe that the Soviet Union has succeeded in manufacturing atomic weapons. Heisenberg did not describe the death ray that he said the Soviet Union is researching, but said that there is existing evidence that Soviet researchers have reached the "initial stages" of developing such weapons. He said that at present, death rays may not have been developed to the point of military value, but insisted that the Soviet Union's discoveries are very "dangerous" in the future.</p>
<h3>Relations Between Cuba and the Soviet Union: Hanging by a Thread</h3>
<p>[United Press, Havana, 10th] Cuba appears to be preparing to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The State Department yesterday released excerpts from two notes to the Soviet Union, which were worded very strongly. One of the notes rejected Soviet protests about the use of masks resembling Stalin's face during the celebration of the Catholic Carnival here. The other note denounced the Communist Party for inciting unrest in Western democratic countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Amman, 9th] The Jordanian Ministry of Defense announced tonight that Israeli troops advanced towards Aqaba Bay and were intercepted by Jordanian troops 50 kilometers from the area, resulting in a fierce battle. Details are unknown. At the same time, British officials in London acknowledged that the situation in Aqaba is serious. However, an Israeli military spokesman in Tel Aviv declared that Israeli troops are only occupying all of their own territory. Aqaba is the common Red Sea outlet for Israel and Jordan. Last autumn, British troops, in accordance with the Anglo-Jordanian joint defense agreement and at the request of the King of Jordan, entered the port, and Israel protested to the Security Council about this matter. How this port should be handled will be determined by the ceasefire negotiations currently being held in Rhodes by Israel and Jordan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 9th] An Israeli spokesperson solemnly denied today the rumors that Israeli troops are operating in Jordanian territory. The statement said that Israeli land and air forces have never operated outside of Israel and have absolutely no intention of invading Jordanian territory. On the contrary, reports from Amman indicate that Jordanian troops have established positions on Israeli territory. Therefore, if a conflict occurs, Jordan should bear full responsibility. According to United Nations officials, they are not aware of any renewed fighting in Palestine.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union May Have Acquired the Secrets of Death Liquid</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Mountain View, California, 10th] US Army Engineer Major Graham said in a speech here today that the Soviet Union is very likely to have acquired the secrets of the Nazi-invented liquid death spray, which is capable of wiping out an entire division in an open field. Because the effects of using this spray are difficult to eliminate for a very long time, the Nazis never formally tested it, and it is expected that the Soviet Union will not dare to use it at present.</p>

The award recipients were all underground personnel from our country who contributed during the War of Resistance, including Sa Benju, Fan Chunsheng (received by his wife Xiang Moying), Jiang Zhuqing, and Fang Shoucheng. All four individuals, during the War of Resistance, risked danger and difficulty to find ways to help British and American expatriates escape from enemy-occupied areas, and were themselves arrested by the Japanese as a result, suffering severe torture. Fan Chunsheng even sacrificed his life for it. The British government, grateful for the righteousness and bravery of the four gentlemen, believes that they made outstanding contributions to the Allied victory, and therefore specially awarded them certificates and medals to commend them. Among the four, Sa Benju was the protagonist of the first "War of Resistance Wife" case in this city, and is already well-known to Shanghai society. Mr. Sa currently works in Taiwan and made a special trip to Shanghai for the ceremony.</p>

Mr. Fan was later executed by the Japanese military police, leaving behind his wife, Ms. Xiang Meiling, and seven children. (3) Mr. Jiang Zhuqing, while working in Qingpu County, risked his life to escort Major Ente and his party out of danger. One recipient of a medal: (4) Mr. Fang Shoucheng, who served as the head of Chinese personnel at the British Army Headquarters in China, diligently fulfilled his duties for the British Army's war efforts in China and made meritorious contributions, and was specially awarded the Order of the British Empire (Civil Division).

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Lingde, a Ningbo native with no legitimate profession, helped maintain order at the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in this city after the "Jiangya" ship disaster occurred. On the afternoon of the 24th of last month, at around 2:00 p.m., he picked up a survivor's relief examination form belonging to the bereaved family of the deceased Ye Huishun and Ye Xingpei at the association.

After the plaintiff's statement was finished, the court instructed both parties to go outside to reconcile. If reconciliation failed, the trial would be rescheduled.</p>

<h3>Salaries of National School Teachers and Staff; Strongly Request Issuance According to Index; Also Request Supplementary Payment for February Salaries</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The salaries of teachers and staff in national universities and colleges in this city have been paid on a temporary basis after the principals went to Beijing to petition and received funds, and after verbal agreement from Deputy Minister Chen, provisionally at 500 times the original salary. The Ministry of Education recently sent a telegram, believing that it should still be issued according to the government's regulations, i.e., the March salary should be prepaid at three times the standard of the February salary (i.e., 225 times), and more will be refunded and less will be supplemented after the government approves the adjustment plan at the end of the month. The principals still request that the salary be calculated according to the local cost of living index, believing that after the cost of living index for March is released, the Ministry of Education should supplement the amount that is insufficient in addition to the 500 times that has already been issued, and also request supplementary payment for the February salary. They believe that it is not excessive to pay university professors according to the cost of living index. The National University Professors' Association also expressed dissatisfaction with the government's method of adjusting the treatment of public school personnel and insisted on issuing salaries according to the original salary multiplied by the cost of living index without deduction. They are now waiting for the measures taken after the new cabinet is formed.</p>
<h3>Students of Seven Universities in a State of Starvation; Joint Telegram to Acting President Li; Requesting Permission for Full Public Funding</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Self-funded and semi-self-funded students in national universities and colleges in this city have recently been unable to pay for meals due to soaring prices, and have been requesting full public funding. Yesterday, all self-funded and semi-self-funded students from seven schools, including Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Tongji University, Jinan University, the Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Business College, and Tangshan Institute of Technology, jointly sent a telegram to Acting President Li, stating that they are now in a state of starvation and earnestly requesting that the public funds allocated for North China be transferred to schools in Shanghai for full public funding to relieve their suffering. In addition, they also published a statement to the community for striving for full public funding, stating: "The threat to our lives has made it impossible for us self-funded and semi-self-funded students to afford food, and we are about to face starvation. In the past, for the sake of life and studies, we borrowed and pawned everywhere, we were home tutors, we reclaimed wasteland, held auctions, and shined shoes to barely make it through month after month. In a state of semi-starvation, anemia and lung disease are attacking us. However, even this kind of life is now at its wit's end, and we are unable to bear it." They pointed out that the reason for this is the high-speed inflation, and gave an example: "A student's family sold one shi of rice in the countryside, but after two weeks of transfer, it was only worth one dou of rice when it arrived. Another student was a home tutor and had an income of seven dou of rice at 8/19, but now it is only enough to pay for the fare denominated in Guan Yuan. These are all for students who are relatively resourceful, and it is even more conceivable for those who have no relatives or whose families are affected by the war and rely entirely on selling things to pay for food." For this reason, they are striving for full public funding to solve the "most basic survival problem" and expressed "We will not rest until our goal is achieved."</p>

<p>Wang Zhuyi Reports on Loan Negotiation Process</p>
<p>Wang Zhuyi then reported on the process of negotiating the loan at the Central Bank yesterday morning, stating briefly: Today, those who went to the Central Bank to request the loan included Mayor Wu, Council Speaker Pan, Deputy Council Speaker Xu, Secretary-General Xiang, and Councilors Zhang Zhongyuan, Jiang Hao, and Ma Junshuo, as well as Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue. Liu Gongyun and Lin Chongyong were also present at the bank. The representatives stated that the Council felt deeply challenged between considering the burden on citizens and maintaining public utilities. Speaking for the people is the Council's duty. Everyone felt that the only way out was to request a loan from the Central Bank, so that on the one hand, public utilities could be maintained and, on the other hand, public support could be secured. They hoped the Central Bank would definitely provide assistance. President Liu and Director Lin both indicated that loans could be granted in principle, but such a large US dollar figure, equivalent to nearly 30 billion Gold Yuan, was equal to one-third of the Gold Yuan issuance amount, which the Central Bank absolutely could not afford. They hoped the Council and the city government could strictly review the minimum amount, and then the Central Bank would be happy to provide the loan.</p>
<p>Reviewing the Amount in the Morning; Negotiating the Loan Again in the Afternoon</p>
<p>After Councilor Wang finished his report, the discussion of the loan amount began. Everyone agreed that the amount of over 4 million US dollars was astonishingly large. The initial plan was to reduce it to nearly 1 million US dollars. However, Speaker Pan indicated that the Council's responsibility was to determine the base figure and calculate the fees based on multiples of the cost of living index. As for the economic disconnect losses between upper and lower index periods, each company should find its own ways to manage. When they cannot find a way to manage, the city government should help them obtain loans from the Central Bank. The Council has no right or responsibility to determine the amount. Therefore, it was suggested that the Public Utilities Subcommittee, together with the city government, conduct a detailed review of the accounts to determine whether there was any concealment of inventory, and then determine the amount. This was unanimously approved. It was decided to expedite the review today in the morning and to visit Finance Minister Xu Kan before 2:00 PM this afternoon, and then proceed to the Central Bank at 3:00 PM to conduct loan negotiations.</p>
<h3>Tram Price Increase Rejected by Council</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Zhao reported at the meeting yesterday that the tram fare in this city should be adjusted today according to the new regulations. The councilors unanimously decided to prohibit the price increase because the Guan Yuan pricing method has been abolished, and the Central Bank will provide loans for the loss portion.</p>

<h3>University Student Seeks Father but Fails; Stealing Clothing Leads to Suspended Sentence</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Jie, a student at the Central Political University in Nanjing, came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the ninth of last month. Unable to find his father and facing financial difficulties, he went to the Normal School on Wujin Road on the 24th of last month at noon to visit a friend. He entered the bedroom of Pan Xizhi, a student at the school, and stole clothing such as suit pants and shirts. Pan caught him on the spot and handed him over to the Hongkou Police Department, which transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. Presiding Judge Wu Xiangzu sentenced him to six months in prison yesterday, but considering that the defendant was forced to resort to such measures due to financial difficulties, he granted a three-year suspended sentence to allow him to rehabilitate himself.</p>

It was learned that the deceased was named Fan Chuanxin, 35 years old, from Taizhou, residing at 26 Fukang Branch Road, Yangjiadu, and worked as a manure collector. The fatal injuries were located in both the head and neck. After investigation, it was discovered that Xu Guisheng, the owner of the Zhenxing store at that location, was highly suspected. Xu was detained for questioning.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Murder Case in Jiangsu Road, West Shanghai; Woman Dies Tragically by Knife; Room Clothes Disordered; Radio Seemingly Used as Cover</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A bizarre murder case occurred at 46 A, Lane 763, Jiangsu Road, West Shanghai, yesterday at noon. The deceased was a middle-aged woman named Li Xiuzhen, who sustained a total of 13 knife wounds to her head and shoulders. Her husband, Wu Shiren (45 years old, from Shanghai), currently works as a coppersmith at the British-owned tram company and has been there for 26 years. He is usually kind to others. He and the deceased have a son and a daughter, Hui Guo (9 years old) and Meifeng, who are both studying at nearby Zhuan Elementary School. Yesterday, Wu went to work at the company as usual, and after Hui Guo and the others went to school, they returned home for lunch. They found the main door tightly closed and no response to their calls, so they played at the entrance of the lane. It was not until 5:00 PM, when Wu returned from the company, that he questioned the situation, which aroused suspicion, because the deceased usually did not go out. He hurried back to knock on the door, and at the same time, he saw the clothes in the room in disarray from the windows. The most bizarre thing was that the five-lamp radio, which was originally placed in the bedroom, had been moved to the entrance of the room, and the radio bulbs were still lit, indicating that someone had been listening to the program. However, after calling for a long time, there was no sound. He had no choice but to break the glass window of the back door to find a way in. At that time, Wu immediately smelled a strong smell of blood. When he entered the inner room, he suddenly saw his wife lying dead on the small bed against the corner of the wall, her face covered in blood, her hands seemingly struggling. Wu rushed out in horror and quickly informed nearby relatives and friends. He immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Branch, which dispatched officers to investigate. The Criminal Investigation Division of the General Bureau also dispatched officers to the scene to take photos. The deceased was then transported to the mortuary for an autopsy. Afterwards, Wu inspected the clothes in the room and only discovered that the gold ring and two gemstone rings that the deceased used to wear were missing. Nothing else was missing. At the same time, according to Wu, his wife was usually honest and had very little contact with nearby residents. However, it is speculated that when the murderer acted, he placed the radio at the door and turned on the program to prevent the deceased's cries for help from reaching outside. Based on this, it can be inferred that the motive for the murder seems to be premeditated. The case is currently under detailed investigation by the police.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Province Prohibits Clan Fights, Promulgates Handling Measures; Those Who Murder and Commit Arson Will Be Executed; Weapons on Both Sides Must Be Registered</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 8th] Clan fights in various parts of Jiangxi Province have progressed from individual combat with shoulder poles and iron hoes to trench warfare with machine guns and mortars. The Fenyi battle last year was the greatest scene in Jiangxi's clan fight war. Recently, bloody clashes have been occurring in Yugan, Nanchang, Xinyu, and other places. The Provincial Security Command feels unable to suppress these "local incidents" and is extremely distressed by the ineffectiveness of the bans.</p>
<p>Causes of Clan Fights</p>
<p>Looking at the clan fights in Jieqiao Lake, Zexi, and Chadong in Fenyi County, as well as the bloody cases in Meixi in Yugan and Jiangdongwei in Xinyu, it is truly heartbreaking. Why are the ignorant people of Jiangxi, a province known for its literary integrity, so eager to engage in private fights! According to general analysis, there are several reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Due to local factional rivalries, local bullies instigate behind the scenes, leading to clan fights.</p>
<p>(2) Due to surname prejudice and the influence of feudal tribal thinking, unequal distribution of obligations and rights within a surname, village, or township can lead to conflicts.</p>
<p>(3) Conflicts arise from disputes over farmland irrigation, fishing, grazing, forests, graves, or school property belonging to a surname or village.</p>
<p>(4) Local tyrants and gentry, as well as local factions, attempt to use clan fights to gain or maintain their feudal or unique positions and rights.</p>
<p>(5) Unemployed vagrants stir up trouble, leading to conflicts due to emotional impulses.</p>
<p>(6) Ignorant and foolish people are coerced into blindly participating. Chairman Fang Tianyi, noting the frequent occurrence of clan fights in various places, which not only damage local vitality but also undermine spiritual unity, has drafted measures to handle clan fights, which have been issued to various counties, and has published a "Respectful Announcement to the People of the Province on Eliminating Clan Fights."</p>
<p>Handling Measures</p>
<p>The provincial government has now decided that if such bloody incidents occur again in the future, they will be handled in accordance with the handling measures, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Those who initiate clan fights and those who instigate them behind the scenes will be severely punished in accordance with the law. (2) Those who participate in clan fights and commit murder or arson will be sentenced to death in accordance with the law. (3) In areas where clan fights occur, if the government's fair intervention is ineffective, or if the government's fair resolution is not accepted and clan fights continue, the government will send troops to suppress them. (4) In clan fight areas, the local government will immediately organize an impartial committee, appoint local impartial individuals to uphold justice, assess right and wrong, determine the criminal responsibility of offenders, and report them to the government for legal action. (5) All firearms and weapons on both sides participating in clan fights must be registered and branded within a time limit and will still be allocated to the local government for distribution to the public self-defense forces for self-defense purposes. (6) Those who blindly participate in clan fights will be drafted into military service. (7) If the heads of rural communities in clan fight areas fail to report the situation in advance, resulting in clan fights, they will be severely punished. (8) Those who secretly report the location of clan fight weapons and lead to their seizure will be generously rewarded.</p>
<h3>Jurong Once Looted; Captured Soldiers Wearing Pine Branches</h3>
<p>Looted Items Returned to Original Owners</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Jurong, 8th] On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, some local troops passing through to Gaochun, Lishui, and other places carried out looting. More than ten families in Doumen Village, including Yang Qiwen, were completely looted, with losses estimated at over a hundred thousand. The family of Li Depu in Xipu West Village was able to resist with knives and spears organized by the local community, preventing the looting. However, on the 6th, a large number of troops were specially dispatched, carrying various types of firearms and swarming into the village. They first tied up or monitored the villagers one by one. Five young people were injured for resisting. The entire village was eventually looted. Fortunately, the Internal Police Corps stationed at Tianwang Temple heard about it and immediately dispatched a detachment of police officers, who arrested the looting soldiers along with their firearms. Just as they were about to investigate, a high-ranking officer from the military unit arrived to negotiate. The looted items were returned to their original owners, and all the soldiers' weapons were also returned to the high-ranking officer, with the hope that such actions would not occur again in the future.</p>
<h3>Changzhou's "Endless Spring Sorrow" A Series of Kidnappings for Ransom</h3>
<p>Spring has arrived in Changzhou, bringing with it a series of kidnapping cases, bizarre and grotesque, truly reflecting the suffering of the people amidst the military chaos of the Jiangnan region. The Seventh Replenishment Training Corps of the Ministry of National Defense was ostensibly meant to recruit wandering soldiers and stragglers. Company Commander Long Debin, Squad Leader Li Jiaxiang, and Sergeant Zhang Yonghong were busy in the West Gate area, arresting good citizens, falsely accusing them of being vagrants, and extorting white rice from them for ransom. More than eighty people were victimized. When the case was broken, Long, Li, Zhang, and others were arrested and are currently being interrogated. Coincidentally, while the case of the Replenishment Training Corps was developing, Dong Guoquan and others were also apprehended along the Miaoyan River. They relied on a certain military unit to arrest deserters, setting up an office along the Miaoyan River. Starting on the 19th of last month, they dispatched seven or eight soldiers to randomly arrest good citizens, totaling more than thirty-seven people. After extorting large sums of money from each of them, they released twenty-four people. There were still thirteen people who, because they had no money to redeem themselves, had their ears pierced with lead wire and were escorted to the railway station, intending to escape and turn them in. However, the net of justice is far-reaching, and they were finally apprehended by the city defense force. After interrogation, they confessed to the kidnapping and extortion. On the 7th, all the criminals, Dong Guoquan, Yin Dezhong, Wang Zifeng, Chen Yunlan, Yang Yicheng, Lu Fengshan, Tang Yuanzu, Gao Shoushan, and Zhang Junsheng, were transferred to the Pacification Command for legal action. Before the dust settled from one incident, another arose. Wang Yaocheng, the owner of the Daan Hotel in Hualong Lane, went to the countryside to attend a relative's banquet on the morning of the 5th and disappeared that day. The next day, a young man named Chen Chunsheng, using the pseudonym Wang, went to the hotel and claimed that its owner had been arrested by a certain military unit for a case and that he would not be released unless 50 shi of rice was paid as a lobbying fee, and that his life was in danger. He also claimed that military secrets could not be leaked. After repeated negotiations, the hotel agreed to pay 20 shi for his release. On the 7th, while retrieving the money, they were finally apprehended by the city defense force. The incident involved a secret organization. At the office of the Chengyu Flour Mill in Yangliu Lane in the city, three uninvited guests suddenly arrived at around 9:00 PM on the 5th, one in plain clothes and two in uniform. Under the pretext of checking household registrations, they robbed the guard Zhang Fusheng of a fast-slow machine gun and fled. Afterwards, the police station dispatched officers and were busy for a while, but that was the end of it. (Our Reporter Li Tianhang)</p>
<h3>Chengfa County Hears of Threatening Letter Case; Forensic Doctor Liu Boqun Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 9th] A threatening incident that occurred in the city recently caused a sensation and was quickly solved by the police. Yang Xiepei, the chief of the eleventh Bao of Zhongshan Town, relying on the legacy of his ancestors, had some assets. Starting on the 19th of last month, he received three threatening letters signed "Chen Tong, Director of the Eighth Route Army Second Regiment Office in Chengfa," demanding 5 qian of gold. The letter also contained a bullet. The content was absurd, instructing him to place the gold in the stone crevice on the southwest corner of Masi Bridge. Chief Yang sent a gold ring weighing 2.5 qian to Masi Bridge while secretly dispatching personnel to observe. They saw a person lingering there. Upon questioning, the person presented a forensic officer's certificate from the Jiangyin District Court, with the name Liu Boqun. Because there was no other evidence, he was not detained. On the 5th of this month, Yu Fusen, the owner of the Baosheng Silver Shop on Nanheyan Street in Hongqiao, also received the same threatening letter with the same signature, with five bullets attached. The intelligence department devised various plans and learned that Yang's ring was at the relative's house of Zhang Shaolin, a cadre in Zhongshan Town, and that the gold ring had been taken by Liu Boqun and pawned. On the 7th, the county government sent police to Wenheng Bridge to arrest Liu and found four rifle bullets, a bottle of blue ink, letter paper, and a fake seal carved from soap, as well as a letter to Deputy Adjutant Yang Zhonglun of the Nanyuan Garden Hotel in Changshu. He was immediately taken to the county government, where the military law office interrogated him all night. Liu Boqun firmly denied the case, only claiming that the bullets were left behind by the army, that the letter was written by Gu Yuanhong from Jijiashi in Jiangbei, who had returned home last winter, and that the gold ring belonged to Ding A'gen, a tea server at the Dadong Hotel in Beiwai. However, he admitted to smoking opium for a year and currently serving as a forensic officer at the District Court. The county government, considering the seriousness of the case, detained Liu, while collecting strong evidence for strict legal action.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Approved Students to Receive Payments Starting Tomorrow Upon Presentation of Notification Slips</h3>

<h3>Three-Person Team Studies Technical Improvements; National Bank Continues Gold Allocation Yesterday; Tightening of Credit Leads to Gradual Decrease in Gold Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank, due to excessive gold price fluctuations the previous day and a significant discrepancy between the allocated price and the market price, held a careful discussion of technical improvements by a three-person team yesterday morning. Therefore, the opening price for jewelry stores was delayed until 10:30 AM. The allocated price was determined to be 290,000 yuan, and jewelry stores were notified to apply if needed. The application period in the morning was extended until 12:30 PM. As a result, over 1,000 taels were allocated. In the afternoon, jewelry stores were notified to continue selling at the old allocated price, but because the market price was low, no one applied.</p>
<p>Later, the person in charge of the National Bank's business bureau told reporters that the National Bank is still considering expanding the scope of gold allocation. However, at present, the method of selling gold, although seemingly through jewelry stores, is based on money, not personal connections. As long as there is capital, sales will be maximized. At the same time, various effective methods are being adopted in the market to achieve the goal of controlling gold prices. The low gold price today (the 10th) is clear evidence of this. As for the public market for gold and silver, it is still being actively organized. Regarding the rumor that a large amount of remittances from other cities has recently arrived in Shanghai, he said he had not heard of it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday's gold market opened low in the morning, with prices ranging from 295,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan due to tight credit. Later, as the credit situation worsened, market prices gradually decreased, reaching a low of 284,000 to 287,000 yuan. There was a rumor in the market that transfer requests from money exchange companies were no longer being approved for customers. Therefore, the gold industry, for the sake of caution, closed the market around 11:30 AM, with prices at 287,000 to 290,000 yuan. When the market opened at 2:00 PM, credit remained tight, and the market remained stagnant. It finally closed at 300,000 to 303,000 yuan. If the daily interest rate of one yuan is deducted, this price is equivalent to a gold market price of only 270,000 yuan that day.</p>
<h3>Sudden Tightening of Credit; Continued Decline in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>At a time when the monetary authorities are selling goods to suppress prices, credit has tightened again, buying sentiment is dissipating, and with half an hour until closing, there were even rumors that the Central Bank had issued a notice to stop the use of exchange application forms, in order to reduce the time of currency circulation.  As such, speculative buyers felt even more constrained, selling off holdings to avoid high interest rates. Thus, the price of Wing On Textile stock, after breaking through 5.20 yuan, declined sharply, and closed at its low for the day of 4.87 yuan, returning to its price at the beginning of the week. Its high price at the beginning of trading was 5.42 yuan, and the low price was 4.87 yuan, with a fluctuation range of 0.55 yuan. Other stocks also declined significantly, with drops ranging from 10% to 20%. Lee On Textiles dropped to the limit. Taiwan Sugar was at 1,500 yuan, Wing Yep dropped 10 yuan, while New Asia, Chun Wah, Union, National Goods, and New China all rose 10% to 20%. Total turnover for the half-day was 3.5749 billion shares.</p>
<p>The opening price for gold bonds was 149,000 yuan, rising to 160,000 yuan. After a slight pause, it fell from 160,000 yuan to 140,000 yuan, its low for the day, with a fluctuation of 20,000 yuan. The midday closing price was 151,000 yuan, a decrease of 11,000 yuan. A total of 41 taels were traded in the half-day. The opening price for the afternoon session was 154,000 yuan, immediately dropping to 153,000 yuan. Later, it rose to 155,000 yuan, with a fluctuation of 2,000 yuan, a decrease of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous day. A total of 20 taels were traded.</p>
<h3>Decline in Foreign Stocks After Showing Initial Strength</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks, after showing initial strength, turned weak. Credit in the circle was quite tight, with the daily interest rate above 80 yuan. As such, sentiment became even more fragile. Ewo Yarns traded at 9,000 yuan and 9,300 yuan, a decrease of 1,500 yuan compared to the previous day. British American Tobacco traded at 1,100 yuan and 1,200 yuan, a drop of 150 yuan compared to the previous day. Wheelock Marden saw a significant decline, trading at 2,800 yuan and 3,100 yuan, down by about 500 yuan. Jardine Matheson saw large fluctuations, trading at 27,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan, a decline of more than 10% compared to the previous day. Other stocks saw decreases of several hundred yuan each.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Interbank Lending Rates</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The daily interest rates for deposits and loans between banks, money shops, and trust companies will be revised as follows from today (the 10th): Daily interest rate for loans (per thousand yuan): 60 yuan, interbank daily interest rate: 48 yuan, interbank overdraft daily interest rate: 15 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the Central Bank has decided to adjust the daily interest rate for interbank deposits in March to 40 yuan, from the original 32 yuan.</p>
<h3>Repayment of Legal Tender Bonds Completed Yesterday as Scheduled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the revised "Measures for Handling Government Legal Tender Bonds," the originally stipulated amount of legal tender to be repaid for each bond denomination (originally a maximum of 27,000 times and a minimum of 1,000 times) has been revised to a maximum of 1,350,000 times and a minimum of 50,000 times, converted into gold yuan at the legally prescribed conversion rate. Early repayment will still be made in one lump sum and must be completed within one month. However, those who have already made early repayments before the implementation of the revised measures will not be entitled to additional payments. It is learned that the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank and its branches in various locations, based on instructions from the Ministry of Finance, began to handle repayments in accordance with the revised measures and stipulated multiples from February 11, and completed them yesterday (the 10th) as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Revises Branch System; Each District to Become Independent Institution</h3>
<p>The Central Bank's branch system has already been established. However, given the evolving situation, the functions and organization of each branch will be redefined. The directors of the Hankou, Guangzhou, and Chongqing branches have gathered in Shanghai to discuss this issue. It is learned that each branch will become an independent institution. In addition to executing the orders of the head office, it will have specific authority within certain limits to handle matters independently and to regularly inspect and supervise the business of branches and offices in its jurisdiction. Concrete plans have been developed and will be implemented after approval by President Liu. The directors of each district, Yang Rumei, Ding Shiqi, and Yang Xiaobo, have returned to their respective positions to formally carry out their duties.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Lending Advisory Committee Held Sixth Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The sixth meeting of the Agricultural Lending Advisory Committee of the Central Bank's Lending Committee was held at 3:00 PM yesterday. The Deputy Secretary-General of the committee, Fang Shangui, and committee members Zhang Xinyi and Wang Maoqing, etc., attended the meeting to discuss the 1938 fiscal year loan plan and other related cases. It is reported that, in order to adapt to the agricultural season, it is proposed to recommend that agricultural loans be disbursed first, pending government approval. However, this is still subject to approval by the Lending Committee next week.</p>
<h3>Goods Owners Continue to Raise Prices; Rice Prices Continue to Rise; Flour and Oil Markets See Slight Declines at Closing</h3>
<p>Rice prices continue to rise, as goods owners continue to raise prices due to higher prices for other goods the previous day. Early trading in white rice and thin paddy rice broke through the 30,000 yuan mark, trading at 30,500 yuan. Later, due to a shortage of speculative funds and tight credit, prices fell back. White rice in the North Market ended at 30,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan. Special rice traded at a high price of 31,100 yuan. Thick and thin rice in the South Market each rose by more than 2,000 yuan. Total arrivals in the two markets amounted to 8,373 shi.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Prices continued to rise, but sentiment turned weak at the closing, and the final settlement was still higher. The initial opening was stable, but buying sentiment in the Central Market was very strong. Rapeseed oil reached 120,000 yuan, and soybean oil reached a high of 127,000 yuan. The closing price was finally affected by tight credit and falling speculative prices, and prices fell back. Soybean oil closed at 122,000 yuan, up 7,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil closed at 114,000 yuan, up 4,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil in the Central Market opened at 150,000 yuan (per 9-gallon barrel), up 12,000 yuan. Soybean cake closed flat.</p>
<p>Flour: Under the Central Bank's strenuous efforts to tighten credit, sellers were eager to sell. Although the initial market once rose due to rising rice prices, the market ultimately weakened due to high interest rates and fragile sentiment, and rumors of selling goods never stopped. Buyers were cautious and did not dare to report in large quantities. Old Brand closed at 12,850 yuan, and Warship closed at 12,310 yuan in the after-market, slightly higher than the previous day. Bran was slightly higher, and the Big Package Fuxin brand stabilized at 10,000.</p>
<p>Other Grains: The rising trend slowed down. Soybean prices slightly rebounded after rising, due to a weakening of oil cake. Vehicle beans fell by 1,000 yuan in the after-market, trading at 27,000 yuan. Sesame and mung beans rose by 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were stable. Corn and red sorghum slightly trended upward.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Stable and Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw very high interest rates due to tight credit, but actual sales were still brisk, and buyers from the "native" group constantly replenished their supplies. Market conditions were nominally rising but effectively stable. Number Four-and-a-Half sugar first traded at 53,000 yuan. Upon hearing that gold prices had fallen, sentiment became very weak, and the price once fell to 51,500 yuan. Subsequently, buyers from the "native" group acted, buying sentiment unfolded, and quoted prices rebounded. The price closed near noon at 52,000 yuan. Coarse sugar was at 49,500 yuan, up 2,500 yuan. Medium sugar, red cotton, second-grade Taiwan red cotton, and white cotton were not traded. The rest were up a thousand yuan each.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Circuitously Moving Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black and green tea were still favored by buyers. However, transactions continued to be withered due to scarcity and shortage of supply. The trend, in the above circumstances, was not constrained by tight credit, and was instead circuitously moving firm. Prices, however, were uniformly stable nominally and firm effectively, depending on the goods. It is learned that currently in Suzhou, Wuxi and other places, all comers were accepting the black tea, and they have been sending staffs to search and collect. If this is achieved, it will be lively.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tung oil market first rose and then leveled off. The morning opening was driven by robust trading in foreign exchange transfer certificates. Buying sentiment was strong, and sellers were raising prices aggressively. The market advanced boldly. Subsequently, amid tight credit, all industries were hit, and the rising trend came to an abrupt halt. However, compared with the previous day, the final settlement was still quite a bit higher.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Adjusted Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to sources at the Four Mines Joint Operations Office, fuel allocation prices were adjusted again yesterday. The allocated price for domestic bituminous coal was increased to 83,220 yuan per ton, up 12,820 yuan from the previous level. White coal nuts and small coal were at 90,000 yuan per ton, white coal lumps were at 130,000 yuan, and white coal dross was at 80,000 yuan. The barge transportation fee remained at 8,000 yuan. However, there was still no foreign coal available, and allocation was temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Silk Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's artificial silk market conditions were weak due to unusually tight credit in the market and the fact that prices of goods outside the industry had stopped rising and had instead fallen. Sentiment was fragile, and the market declined.</p>
<p>The opening price for Grade 3 bright light "102" New Goods was 1.4 million. The trend after the opening was very weak, but due to short covering from the previous day, buying sentiment slightly moved, and quoted prices rose by 30,000 yuan. Subsequently, as gold and banknotes weakened and credit tightened, the rate of daily interest continued to rise, and sales continued unabated. The market re-entered a weak phase, and there was still no improvement at closing. The midday closing price for spot goods was 1.4 million, with tomorrow's futures at 1.49 million yuan. In the afternoon, the trend of tight credit continued to be favorable. Speculative gold and banknotes outside the circle weakened with interest rates. The market was still weak. The initial trading price for Toyo was 1.442 million yuan. After 3:00 PM, gold gradually fell from 310 to between 303. Sentiment was still weak, and quoted prices declined again. The market finally closed at 1.427 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign exchange certificate prices for raw silk rose, and sentiment stabilized slightly. However, due to tight credit in the market and difficulty in turning over short positions, the market was stable and weak. The initial opening price for "78" Evenness White Filature was 2.1 million. It once rebounded to 2.18 million, but later gold prices fell, and the market for spun yarn and cloth outside the industry weakened. The market was unsustainable, and prices immediately trended downward, falling to 2 million at the close near noon. The market was mediocre in the afternoon, but local merchants searched for goods at low prices, and the trading price was slightly higher at 2.05 million yuan.</p>
<p>The silk and satin market was also weak yesterday. Credit within the industry was generally tight, and interest rates increased. Speculative sellers released goods to earn interest, and bulls had strong intentions to go short. Market conditions were first stable and then weak, and prices finally declined at midday closing. The morning opening price for American Asian quilt covers was 965,000 yuan. The trend after the opening was mediocre, but bulls wanted to pull the market up before releasing goods, and the quoted price once rose by 10,000 yuan. However, because the general trend outside the industry was weak, gold and banknotes fell, and Chinese stocks were still weak, the market was unable to struggle, and quoted prices declined, reaching a low of 935,000 yuan. The market still closed at the original level near noon. In the afternoon, the trend of gold and banknotes was initially stable, but it was still weak. Sentiment was lax. The market was initially stable due to the rising gold price with interest rates. The initial quoted price was 960,000 or 970,000, and it once fell to 940,000. It finally closed at 925,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Price List Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Trust Bureau's meeting on artificial silk on the 9th resolved that: The artificial silk price for the 10th period of this year (July 7 to July 12) for Italian goods, Grade 3 bright light "120", is 1,128,000 gold yuan per case.</p>
<h3>Credit Particularly Tight; Daily Interest Rate as High as 150; Tightness Increased After Noon; Settlement Today Still Likely to Remain Tight</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday's credit market in Shanghai was tight throughout the day. The market opened with the settlement of over 1.1 billion yuan in yesterday's spun yarn and cloth, which was immediately due for payment. Credit immediately tightened, and the daily interest rate opened at 80 yuan. However, since borrowing exceeded lending everywhere, and it was said that money exchange companies were not accommodating customers' transfer requests, the daily interest rate gradually rose to 90 to 95 yuan. After noon, the tightness increased, and the daily interest rate hit the 100 yuan mark, once rising as high as 150 yuan. After 4:00 PM, there were many in the industry who lacked orders, and inter-industry lending was at 120 yuan.</p>
<p>The net difference of the State Bank was 67.617 million yuan, the net difference of foreign banks was 59.682 million yuan, the net difference of the Large Exchange was 21.707 million yuan, and the net difference of the Small Exchange was 105.592 million yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be a huge settlement of over 2.1 billion yuan in spun yarn and cloth from the Central Bank and the Textile Construction Company today, so liquidity is likely to maintain yesterday's tightness.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll; Viewing Platform</h3>
<p>Price Falls Little, Pulling is Not Much; Price Falls Much, Pulling is a Lot; Pei Tsu-yi and Hu Hou-chin's Gold Battles Reenacted</p>
<p>Yesterday's credit was very tight, with the black market rate at the end of the evening rising by more than 1.5 yuan, which was truly shocking.</p>
<p>Everyone said credit was tight because the authorities were selling off large quantities of goods. Yesterday, the authorities' efforts were real. At the same time, manufacturers were also selling off goods to raise funds for the mid-month wages, which further contributed to the falling trend.</p>
<p>We have already analyzed that if selling off goods can truly tighten credit, then prices will not be supported. If prices follow the sale of goods, then credit has not been tightened.</p>
<p>This causal relationship is very clear. Selling goods, and being able to tighten credit, must be because someone is buying them. Since someone is buying them, prices cannot fall. This is also certain.</p>
<p>If selling goods brings prices down, surely no one is accepting them. Since no one is buying them, credit is not being tightened. This is also certain.</p>
<p>Of course, the market situation is definitely not that simple, but in any case, it does not go beyond this basic principle.</p>
<p>The biggest features of yesterday's market trend were: (1) the reduction in the amount of applications for gold allocation; (2) the worst stock market decline; (3) gold and banknotes once fell below the Central Bank's official price in the afternoon, but later rebounded slightly, but still did not match the interest rate; (4) rice prices uniquely soared; (5) industrial products such as cigarettes and candles fell particularly sharply; (6) imported goods, although they fell, did not fall much.</p>
<p>Logically, if gold and banknotes are hit, speculative funds can flow into the stock market, but the stock market did not improve yesterday, which shows that it was a credit issue.</p>
<p>The small number of applications for gold allocation and the fact that prices once fell below the official price in the afternoon show that the jewelry stores that applied for gold allocation the day before yesterday could not find liquidity yesterday and had to sell off their holdings. This is why this strange phenomenon occurred. In that case, the credit crunch is in the jewelry industry, and they have once again fallen into the net laid by Pei Tsu-yi's gold policy. Pei Tsu-yi has successors.</p>
<p>The unique surge in rice prices and the sharp drop in industrial products show that manufacturers had to cut goods to raise funds for the mid-month salary. This has nothing to do with farmers and nothing to do with rice prices, so rice prices uniquely rose.</p>
<p>The fact that imported goods did not weaken much is similar to the rice market.</p>
<p>If this analysis is correct, then those who were truly selling off goods yesterday were probably jewelry stores and manufacturers. The authorities may also have sold off goods, but it was certainly not as much as advertised.</p>
<p>Market volatility is greatly affected by psychology. Advertising has become a tool for both sides to fight, and it is especially necessary to exaggerate advertising for those who despise the authorities' strength.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, we also pointed out that any rise before the middle of the month is not genuine. Yesterday's market conditions illustrate this fact.</p>
<p>Today is Friday, and tomorrow is Saturday. Manufacturers who are concerned about interest rates sell off holdings to pay the interest rate and pay salaries when they are due. This calculation means that earlier is cheaper.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Store Business Suddenly Hot and Cold; Complaining About Difficulty Finding Credit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The opening time of the jewelry stores in this city yesterday was delayed until after 10:30 AM because the Central Bank reported the market price too late. Because the public saw that the gold market had soared the previous day, but the Central Bank was still asking jewelry stores to sell gold at an allocated price of 250,000 yuan, it was generally believed that it would still be cheap to buy today. Before the opening of each jewelry store, there were many customers waiting with cash at the door. After the doors opened, they suddenly saw that the posted price for bars had been changed to 295,800 yuan, and the price for jewelry gold was 300,700 yuan. Many were disappointed and left. However, because the gold market was still stable in the morning, and after receiving the Central Bank's notification of an allocation of 290,000, the number of applications for allocation from colleagues actually exceeded 1,000 taels. However, the market weakened in the afternoon. If the daily interest rate is deducted, then the National Bank's allocated price had already exceeded the market price, so everyone requested to return the gold they had already applied for to the National Bank. The National Bank did not grant their request, and each jewelry store had to find credit to repay the payment for the gold they had applied for, and everyone complained. The retail business of each jewelry store also suddenly turned calm due to the low gold price, which was a strong contrast to the situation in recent days.</p>
<h3>Spun Yarn Prices Turned Down After Rising; Cotton Cloth Hovered in a Weak Range</h3>
<p>The rising trend of cotton yarn has been contained. This is because the authorities are selling off goods and tightening credit. Yesterday's interest rate was between 80 yuan and 100 yuan, so sellers were eager to sell because they could not bear the heavy interest burden. Buyers were also mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Each yarn price turned down after rising, and the final settlement was a decline.</p>
<p>"42" count Blue Phoenix rose from 2.18 million yuan to a high of 2.23 million yuan, and the closing price was 2.07 million yuan, a drop of 110,000 yuan. "40" count Blue Phoenix dropped 80,000 yuan, and "32" count Silver Moon dropped 90,000 yuan, closing at 1.37 million yuan.</p>
<p>"21" count Double Horse spot goods opened at 1.07 million yuan. It once rose to 1.11 million yuan in the middle, but ultimately weakened due to tight credit and retreated to 1.025 million yuan at closing, a drop of 125,000 yuan from the previous level. Factory orders traded at 1.02 million yuan. Each grade of "20" count consistently fell within the pass, trading at around 950,000 yuan. Each grade of "16" count and below also languished.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth hovered in a weak range. The market opened in the morning with a trend towards tight credit, and also due to the excessive increase the previous day. People were cautious, and speculative buyers sold off goods. But there were many short covering, so supply and demand were still balanced.</p>
<p>The opening price for Longtou fine cloth was 40,600 yuan, and the price for Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji was 39,900 yuan. Before the Textile Construction Company announced its opening price, each once rose by 500 yuan, but there was still a slight decline after the announcement. The former closed at 40,700 yuan, and the latter closed at 39,700 yuan, roughly the same as the midday closing price on the previous day, but softer than the after-market outside trading price.</p>
<p>The opening price for Laba Tong fine cloth was 39,500 yuan, eventually rising 700 yuan. There were slight fluctuations in each grade of fine cloth. The factory price for high-grade "190" Shilins approached the 90,000 yuan mark, at 89,000 yuan. Printed Biji was at 45,000 yuan, White Cat printed cloth was at 40,000 yuan, and Daming silk was at 70,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Olympic Women's Champion: Biography of Mrs. Koen, the Dutch Flying General</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ding Xin</p>
<p>An introduction to Mrs. Koen, the fastest woman in the world, who shocked the 1948 Olympic Games. At home, in the kitchen, with her husband, sons, and daughters, she doesn't seem like an athlete, but a virtuous wife and loving mother.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] When Mrs. Fanfu Koen returned to her homeland, Amsterdam, from the London Olympics with four shimmering gold medals, the usually dignified and quiet capital of the Netherlands went almost mad.</p>
<p>It was a sunny autumn day in August. A magnificent carriage drawn by four white horses carried the holder of three world records, her husband, and her two children, slowly from the train station to the city hall. There, the mayor was waiting to shake hands and congratulate this female hero who had brought glory to the country, and tens of thousands of people were waiting to admire her appearance and voice. Along the way, countless people who couldn't squeeze into the city hall desperately crowded on the roadside, on balconies, and in upstairs windows, vying to stick their heads out from the crowd, hoping to get even an unclear glimpse lasting only a few seconds. On the carriage, Fanny was not only the focus of millions of eyes and the target of millions of voices, but also a moving target—a target of flowers. Although her seven-year-old son desperately threw back out the bouquets falling on the carriage, Fanny seemed to be standing on a flower car.</p>
<p>In the city hall, Mrs. Koen only used three simple and honest sentences to answer the mayor's eulogy. She said, "I just run a little faster. My husband, I, and our two children make up a very ordinary family. The reason why the public is so enthusiastic about me is probably because my training and victories are all accomplished by taking time out from the busy schedule of washing dishes and mending socks!"</p>
<p>Indeed, from my observation during the week I spent with them, this family is undoubtedly a typical example of a myriad of European middle-class families—diligent, simple, and very resolute. They live a very ordinary life. They live in a small apartment in a four-story brick building; worry about the inadequacy of rationed goods; read publications borrowed from the book and newspaper circulation society; play bridge; and socialize with relatives and friends. Their only hobby outside of daily life is sports.</p>
<p>Fanny and her husband—Jann, are a very harmonious couple. Jann used to be a bank clerk and is now a sports instructor at the Dutch capital's police station. He is also a track and field athlete and has won several championships. Since discovering Fanny's talent on the track in 1935, he has been Fanny's personal coach, so Fanny's achievements today are half due to Jann's efforts. He is fourteen years and three days older than Fanny, and coupled with his gentle appearance and neat grooming, Fanny loves him as a husband and respects him as a teacher. At any banquet or invitation, Fanny always replies with "Let me ask Jann," even in the most ordinary daily conversations, Fanny always follows Jann's wishes.</p>
<p>Although the couple love and care for each other, Jann is extremely serious about coaching Fanny. Fanny always takes Jann's praise as a special honor, overwhelmed by favor. Last autumn, after Fanny won her third championship at the London World Games, Jann made an exception to kiss Fanny on the cheek to congratulate her on her amazing achievement. This was only after the photographers pleaded bitterly!</p>
<p>Fanny's parents are both still alive. These two burly and extraordinary old people in their late sixties still swim, ice skate, and play tennis every day, running and jumping all day long, without showing the slightest sign of old age. (To be continued)</p>
<p>(Top picture) The moment Mrs. Koen reaches the finish line, her ten fingers show her tense emotions. (Bottom picture) She and her husband, who is also her coach Jann, pose for a photo. Hanging on the wall are many glorious medals, which are their joint achievements.</p>
<h3>Huili Force Feeling Tense; Encas Wins by Half a Point</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] In last night's basketball league, Huili Force was miserably defeated by Encas by a mere one point, with the final score being 40 to 39. In the first half, both sides played very tightly, resulting in a score of 19 to 12. Encas's Bo Tou was very successful last night, and the big fat Qiu Quhu also moved like a startled rabbit. Both of them are new players, and their performance was very outstanding. When Huili Force's main player, Ge Peng Qiguofu, injured his hand and left the court in the first half, Huili Force had an opportunity to take advantage, but unfortunately, due to excessive tension, they missed all their free throws in the last few minutes, leading to this miserable situation. Although more than a thousand fans cheered enthusiastically, they left disappointed. In another game in the A1 group, Pei Feier defeated Mai Ling, 56 to 39. In the A2 C group, Pei Er defeated Tie Lian, 44 to 30.</p>
<p>In the game between Encas and Huili Force, the Encas players who started were Ao Chailiao, Sha Sijin, Ge Peng Qiguofu, Bo Tou, and Que Libotuo. Huili Force countered with Tian Fuhai, Wang Yongfang, Ye Yunshan, Cao Zhiji, and Wei Xu.</p>
<p>After the start of the game, Sha Sijin scored first, followed by Yi Fuhai. Ao and Yongfang each made a free throw, tying the score at three points. Wei Xu scored a basket, showing Huili Force's determination. When Ge Bo added three points, Encas chased to 6 to 5. After Chen Zhengmiao replaced Yongfang, Que Li scored again. Through the efforts of Ye and Wei, Huili Force took the lead again at 9 to 8. Encas's big fat Qiu Quhu replaced Sha Sijin, and Botuo did not relax at all. Bo Tou was even able to shoot into the basket with one hand. At this point, the situation was very tense. At 17 to 12, Ge Pengqi injured his hand and left the court, and Sha Sijin returned to the court. The first half ended at 19 to 12.</p>
<p>In the second half, Kai Jiermiluo replaced Sha Sijin, and Huili Force's Yongfang replaced Zhengmiao. Bo Tou fired cold shots from the crowd, and Fuhai scored two consecutive goals, with Yongfang "not yielding." Unexpectedly, opponents Bo Tou and Qiu Quhu were also calm and composed, doing as they pleased. Huili Force still closely followed, and when Wei Xu scored, they were only half a point behind (28 to 27). Unfortunately, Yongfang missed a free throw, otherwise, they would have tied the score long ago. Bo Tou scored another long shot from half court. Looking at Huili Force, Yunshan lacked luck, but Old Tian was indeed blessed, living up to his name, and forced the score to 30 to 29, still a one-point difference. Zhengmiao replaced Wei Cheng, and Yongfang charged in lightly, making the score 31 to 30, with Huili Force taking the lead. Chen committed a foul, Bo Tou made two free throws, and Sha Sijin scored a goal. Although Zhiji returned a free throw, Encas was already leading by two points. Que Li made a free throw, and Yongfang flipped up and shot a goal. Ao Chailiao committed a foul for obstruction, and Wang made another free throw, suddenly tying the score at 35. The stadium was filled with cheers. Sha Sijin attacked along the side, and Encas scored two more points. At that time, there were still two minutes left in the game. Tian did not score, Wang did not make a free throw, but the foreign fat guy scored a goal, and Ao scored one point from a free throw. Although Cao Zhiji and Tian Fuhai later added two goals successively, time was running out, and Encas finally won by a one-point difference with a score of 40 to 39.</p>

In the first half, Pei Er scored 25 points, while Tie Lian scored 21 points. Wu Liangjun of Pei Er and Hu Tongyi of Tie Lian both scored the most points individually.</p>
<p>In the first ten minutes of the second half, Tie Lian stepped up their efforts, trailing by only two goals with a score of 30 to 26. However, they lacked stamina and eventually ended the game with a score of 30 to 44.</p>
<h3>Pei Feier Defeated Mai Ling</h3>
<p>In the A1 group, Mai Ling faced Pei Feier. One was the Marine Corps, and the other was the Navy. Their fighting styles were similar. Not long after the start of the game, Pei Feier took the lead with 9 to 4. Ge Laiqi of Pei Feier made wonderful passes under the basket, and Yi Kate's accurate shooting, whether it was throwing or free throws, always hit the target. Mai Ling found it difficult to raise their heads. In the first half, Pei Feier took the lead with 27 to 20.</p>
<p>After the break, Mai Ling fought desperately. Their captain, Li Si, was tall and strong, a natural match for the opponent's captain, Yi Kate. Hei Tan Bolang scored many points for the Pei team. As a result, Mai Ling was no match for them, losing with a score of 56 to 39.</p>

<h3>There Is No Sorrow on the Sports Field</h3>
<p>Eddie Eichen is a celebrity in the American sports world. He has always been considered an optimist. He has repeatedly pointed out to people the fact that "there is no sorrow on the sports field."</p>
<p>He admits that he himself has not been entangled by sorrow at times, "But," he said, "when I find that sorrow is approaching me, I run to the sports field. A change of body, a run, or a ball game will drive away the sorrow."</p>
<p>He explained, "Because you are particularly busy when you are playing, you can't have any worries anymore. Especially when your body is tired from exercise, your spirit will be liberated from the usual boredom, so your spirit will have a new kind of fun and power."</p>
<h3>Sports World: Fighting and Losing Repeatedly, Losing and Fighting Repeatedly; Movie Stars Playing Ball: Good Gimmick; Shi Hui's "Tipping Toilet," Zhang Fa's Strange Movements</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Although the "You Yi" basketball team's skills are not very good, it has many spectators. It turns out that this basketball team is organized by colleagues in the film and theater industry. Whenever the You Yi team has a game, fans and movie fans come together to watch, so there are more people supporting the team. However, most of the audience is not familiar with the You Yi basketball team, so I will briefly introduce it based on what I know:</p>
<p>The You Yi team was established last year in Ren Yue. At that time, "The Great Reunion" was being staged at the Lyceum Theater. A group of friends backstage suddenly had a whim and proposed to gather colleagues in the film and theater industry to form a basketball team. As soon as the proposal was made, everyone agreed. Although some of them didn't fully understand the basketball rules, the team was still established.</p>
<p>In order to be casual, they lightly gave it the name "You Yi," meaning that no matter what, there is now another basketball team in the world! After each practice or game, they would say to themselves: We have practiced once again, we have lost once again, we have won once again!</p>
<p>After its establishment, they asked Cai Lianke, the captain of the Dagong team, to help guide them, and they did improve a lot. Unfortunately, because their original work was very stressful, they could not spare the time to practice well.</p>
<p>Before the start of the fourth city league, encouraged by Qian Xucang, the chairman of the basketball committee, they resolutely participated in the competition of the Shen Second Group. As the saying goes: A newborn calf is not afraid of a tiger. The You Yi team was able to show its skills in the league because of this fearless spirit.</p>
<p>There were dozens of friends who loved basketball, but due to the restrictions of the registration rules, only ten were selected to participate in the league.</p>
<p>The consultants of the You Yi basketball team are the heads of major film companies. Their leader is Chen Zhonghao, the president of the China Drama Society. Mr. Chen is also a key figure in the China Electric and Mandarin companies. He is enthusiastic, friendly, and loyal, and everyone in the film and theater industry is happy to be friends with him.</p>
<p>The manager is Hong Mo, a director of the Mandarin company. He comes to the scene to plan and cheer for every game.</p>
<p>The secretary is Fang Bo, the only fat comrade in the film and theater industry who loves to play basketball. He is always the first to arrive at the practice field, and his spirit is the best.</p>
<p>The captain, Zhang Fa, has a clear mind, is brave in grabbing and diving for the ball, and sometimes makes strange movements, which the audience praises endlessly.</p>
<p>The guard, Jin Yan, is a veteran of the former Weiming team. He has rich experience, is tall and long-armed, and has skills under the basket.</p>
<p>The forward, Shi Hui, uses the "tipping toilet" posture when shooting. When he is in good form, he makes every shot, and his performance is amazing.</p>
<p>Wei Yuping, serving as a forward, is the most fascinated player in the You Yi team. He never forgets basketball while eating and chatting. He is elastic, jumps high, and is also good at long shots.</p>
<p>Ling Zhihao was a Tianjin league player before. He is tall and has a good grasp of the ball under the basket.</p>
<p>Han Fei is short and nimble, and his movements are clever. He is good at stealing the ball, and sometimes his long shots will go into the basket, even he himself doesn't know why.</p>
<p>He Lu is the left guard and also played ball in Chongqing. He practices very diligently.</p>
<p>Luo Chongzhou is a photographer. He is a veteran of playing basketball and has a very calm demeanor.</p>
<p>The set designer, Su Shifeng, was a basketball star in middle school. Although he is thin, he works hard to practice, and his shooting is gradually becoming normal. He is a scoring expert for the You Yi team.</p>
<p>Wang Xuewu is a veteran comrade in the film and theater industry and also a veteran of the basketball scene, adding a lot of glory to the You Yi team.</p>
<p>In addition to participating in the fourth league, the You Yi team often plays friendly matches with other teams. However, to put it bluntly, they have been fighting and losing repeatedly. However, their spirit is good, and they lose and fight repeatedly. Therefore, the number of spectators and supporters is no less than that of the Shanghai League champion, Hualian. (Chen Chang)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Governor's Cup Football Final: Hualian Team Carefully Selected</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Airmail] The Hong Kong branch of the National Sports Association, in order to select the Hualian representatives for the Governor's Cup final on the 20th of this month, has studied the three positions of center back, right wing, and center forward. As a result, it is generally believed that Miao Changrong's recent performance has been very good and should be given importance to promote new blood. Zhu Yongqiang is in good condition recently and should be allowed to lead the team. Feng Jingxiang's cross-passing skills are excellent and his style is experienced. Since there is a forward with Wei Cili in the center, it is more appropriate to have someone with proficient skills as a forward, which seems more stable than using new blood. Therefore, the following lineup was selected by majority vote. As for calling up substitutes, it is for the purpose of being prepared for any eventuality:</p>
<p>(Leader) Cai Huihong (Captain) Yu Yaode</p>
<p>Yu Yaode (Nannan)</p>
<p>Wei Jinhong (Nannan) Hou Rongsheng (Nannan)</p>
<p>Zhang Jinhai (Nannan) Miao Changrong (Zhonghua) Liu Songsheng (Nannan)</p>
<p>Li Dahui (Bus) Yu Wenzhi (Bus) Zhu Yongqiang (Nanpu) Li Chunfa (Bus) Feng Jingxiang (Nannan)</p>
<p>(Alternates) Yu Qi'en (Zhonghua), Li Bingnan (Zhonghua), Tan Zhenhui (Batu), Kong Qingyu (Bus), Chen Jinpei (Zhonghua), Deng Sen (Zhonghua), Li Bingzhao (Kitchee), Deng Yijie (Bus), Yao Zhuoran (Kitchee).</p>

<h3>Official Language and Circulation</h3>
<p>— Observer</p>
<p>Every time I read the newspaper and see that when a high-ranking official such as a provincial chairman or chief takes office, the first thing they do after getting off the car is to deliver a grand speech, the conclusion of which must be: I will, of course, first stabilize local order, improve the people's lives, and relieve the suffering of the people of this province, and so on.</p>
<p>It is as if the order in the province has always been chaotic, waiting for him to stabilize it; and the people of the province have always been suffering extremely, waiting for him to relieve them. But when the revolving lantern turns, this high-ranking official steps down again, and another new high-ranking official takes office. The new official has to give another speech, preparing to relieve the suffering of the people under the previous official's rule.</p>
<p>How strange! What exactly is going on? I want to relieve the suffering of your people, but when he takes office, he wants to relieve the suffering of my people. It can be seen that the suffering of the people has never been relieved, and perhaps it is getting worse. Otherwise, why is the first sentence of every new official always to relieve the suffering of the people of the province?</p>
<p>I am poor and only serve as an eighth-grade civil servant. I have never been a high-ranking official, so I don't know whether the previous official feels offended when the new official says that he wants to relieve the suffering of the people under his rule, or suspects that the new official is deliberately trying to undermine him, implying that he did not do a good job. I think it probably doesn't matter, because when I took office at the time, or when my official luck turned and I went to take office in another province, I would also say the same thing.</p>
<p>I want to relieve suffering when I take office, and you still want to relieve suffering when you take office, and so on in a continuous cycle. Official language cannot be taken literally, but the fact that the suffering of the people has never been relieved is evidenced even from this official language, which is a direct admission.</p>
<p>Newspapers should only be read casually and never carefully. Otherwise, if you think carefully about this kind of thing, you can't help but laugh or cry.</p>
<h3>The Price of Marriage in Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Qiu Qu</p>
<p>Some people estimate that it costs $10,000 a year to support a wife in Hollywood.</p>
<p>If you want to divorce this wife after a year, it will cost about $100,000.</p>
<p>Most male stars can't come up with this money now. After about 75% of their income is taken away by government agencies or personal managers, there is very little left.</p>
<p>The distribution of this cost is as follows: First, you have to buy her a fur coat; second, she also has to have a coat, all women have one. Then, you buy her two more dresses, a diamond ring, and a necklace.</p>
<p>You may also have to buy her a convertible car so that she can run around and spend money in more places. If she has a child, you have to hire a nanny. And she takes all her old girlfriends out to dinner, and the bill is, of course, on your account.</p>
<p>This is the cost of the first year, $10,000.</p>
<p>After the first year, some stars get a divorce and have to pay $10,000 a year in alimony for the next ten years. So, they marry another wife, which is another $10,000.</p>
<p>One big star earned nearly $800,000 in the past two years. But now, he is penniless. Why? Because he has to pay alimony to several divorced wives in installments, and before the previous debts are cleared, new debts come. And, he has to buy things for his girlfriends right now. It would be strange if he could save a penny.</p>

<h3>Siamese "Police Cats"</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Most people only know that cats catch mice, and few people know that there is actually a cat that catches thieves, and that is the Siamese cat. For hundreds of years, the Siamese have used cats instead of watchdogs, training them to identify and attack thieves. The royal palaces and official residences in Bangkok were once protected by special patrol cats.</p>
<p>When these royal cats are "on duty," they prowl around their posts like sentries, never loafing or running away. If someone tries to climb over the wall or enter secretly, they will sneak up from behind, suddenly jump on the intruder's back, and use their long and sharp claws to firmly grasp the area below the shoulder blades, which makes it impossible for the person being grabbed to reach them with their hands and throw them off. If someone tries to do this, they will growl and bite fiercely with their sharp teeth.</p>
<p>The eyes of Siamese cats are usually blue, but when they are angry, they turn blood red, and their faces also turn red. This seems to be a psychological weapon that has the effect of frightening the enemy. In the remote areas of Siam, it is also common to use cats instead of dogs, and criminals avoid them in the same way. The reputation of Siamese cats is based on facts. In ancient times, Siamese soldiers brought cats to the battlefield as military dogs.</p>
<p>The private lives of Siamese cats are very interesting. They are believers in monogamy. If given the opportunity, they will choose their own mates and remain faithful for life. The opposite-sex partner chosen by kittens in their youth often never separates. When they reach maturity, they become a harmonious couple. If they are separated, they will become depressed and depressed.</p>
<p>Cat couples like to use the same bowl and eat together. However, during courtship, the male cat usually eats first, and the female cat waits by his side until he is full before quietly going up to eat the leftovers. But as soon as the cat wife is pregnant, all this changes completely. During the period when the female cat is pregnant and breastfeeding, the male cat always allows his wife to eat her fill. Only after the kittens are weaned does the cat husband regain his priority.</p>
<p>Because Siamese cats have the characteristic of catching thieves, they have become a special product of Siam, so some foreign tourists inevitably want to buy one or two and take them back to their country, and they all choose cats with tails that are knotted and curved, because it is said that this kind of cat is a genuine royal cat. The natives who sell cats also always say that their cats were stolen from the palace. In fact, stealing royal cats is a capital crime. Who would want to commit a serious crime for the sake of earning a small amount of money? However, the fact that a curved tail is a characteristic of royal cats has a story that has been passed down by word of mouth:</p>
<p>It is said that in ancient times, a Siamese king went out to fight in a war. Before leaving, he took off his magic ring and gave it to his queen to keep, telling her to put it in a safe place to prevent it from being lost or stolen.</p>
<p>After he went on the expedition, the queen put the magic ring on the tail of her beloved cat, because she thought it was the safest place. In order to prevent the ring from slipping off, she tied a knot on the cat's tail. So, this knot became permanent, and the descendants of this queen's beloved royal cat inherited this special deformity and became the symbol of the royal cat.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, cats will never have knotted tails for generations just because their ancestors' tails were accidentally knotted. Cats with knotted and curved tails are not very rare, and the reason for their formation is not mysterious. However, it is because the position of their tail vertebrae is slightly different from that of ordinary cats.</p>
<h3>Flower Deity Lantern</h3>
<p>Today is the twelfth day of the second month of the old lunar calendar, which is the birthday of all flowers.</p>
<p>Flower Deity Lanterns, commonly known as Liangsan Lanterns (cool umbrella lanterns), are seasonal objects for celebrating the birthday of all flowers in old Shanghai. The lanterns are made of a type of paper called "Tan Jian," but it looks even finer than silk. They are intricately carved with figures, flowers, precious birds, and exotic animals, making them exceptionally delicate and lifelike. The lanterns are round or hexagonal, with tassels and fringes on the corners and lower ends. When displaying the lanterns, they are accompanied by a Shifan (ten categories) percussion ensemble, slender waist drums, and paper-made flower branches and baskets. Sometimes, there are also platform displays, making it quite lively.</p>
<p>In other places, lantern markets are generally held during the Lantern Festival. In Shanghai, in addition to the Lantern Festival lantern market, the Flower Festival lantern market is also quite lively and particularly appreciated by literati and scholars. They find the Lantern Festival lanterns too vulgar and uninteresting, so they turn to value the Flower Deity Lanterns of the Flower Festival.</p>

First, they prepare red and green flower buckets and use small silk scrolls to write the item names on them, tied with red silk. Various kinds of vegetables and shepherd's purse flowers are planted in them. When the banquet is in full swing, from the central palace onwards, each person uses a golden comb to pick from them. Empresses, imperial sons, noble princesses, and concubines, as well as all the chief eunuchs, receive rewards without penalties. Each bucket has ten numbers, with five red characters for rewards and five black characters for penalties. The highest rewards are complete sets of real pearls, jade cups, gold utensils, northern pearls, comb rings, beaded hair ornaments, and neck cloths. The next level includes silver ingots, wine vessels, crown hairpins, jade flowers, silk fabrics, ambergris, imperial calligraphy brushes and ink, and official kiln Ding ware. The penalties include dancing and singing, reciting poetry, chanting Buddhist scriptures, drinking cold water, and eating raw ginger, using these to create amusement. Royal palaces and noble residences also imitate this practice."</p>
<p>Xichao Lishi says: "On the second day of the second month, scholars and women all wear mugwort leaves." The saying goes: "Mugwort blooms before all herbs, wearing it keeps spring young."</p>
<p>Tian Rucheng's West Lake Travelogue says: "Flower Morning and Moon Evening are common sayings. The second and eighth months are the middle of spring and autumn, so the middle of the second month is the Flower Morning, and the middle of the eighth month is the Moon Evening."</p>
<p>Chengdu Zhi says: "The fifteenth day of the second month is the Flower Morning, for butterfly-catching gatherings. People of Shu also sell silkworms in the market on this day, indulging in music and sightseeing, calling it the Silkworm Market."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Old Tales, Part Four: A Brief History of the Garden Bridge</h3>
<p>— Jizhai</p>
<p>From the western and central districts to the Hongkou and Tilanqiao areas, the Garden Bridge is not the only necessary route, but among all the bridges over the Suzhou Creek, the Garden Bridge is undoubtedly the most solid and magnificent in construction, and it also bears the most significant transportation responsibility. The name "Garden Bridge" (外白渡橋) is speculated to be a phonetic corruption of "Outer Ferry Bridge" (外擺渡橋). Because when bridges were not yet built over the Suzhou Creek, people relied on ferries to cross between the two banks, and there were many ferry crossings along the river. The place closest to the Bund was called "Outer Ferry," so the bridge built there was naturally called the Outer Ferry Bridge, which is also reasonable. However, when this bridge was first built, pedestrians, carriages, and horses had to pay to cross, just like paying for a ferry ride. Later, the bridge was taken over by the public and no longer charged a toll, which effectively turned it into a "free ferry" (白渡). Therefore, calling it the "White Ferry Bridge" (白渡橋) is indeed fitting.</p>
<p>Research shows that the construction of the Garden Bridge began in 1853, the third year of the Xianfeng reign. At that time, an Englishman named Wills saw the frequent traffic of carriages, horses, and pedestrians on the west bank of the Suzhou Creek and thought it was a profitable business. He obtained permission from the Shanghai Daotai (local official) and the concession authorities to organize a "Wills Bridge Company" and build a large bridge there. It was completed in 1856 (the sixth year of the Xianfeng reign) and named Wills Bridge. This was the predecessor of the Garden Bridge.</p>
<p>This bridge was, of course, built with wooden planks. In addition to the bridge piers on both sides, there was a drawbridge in the middle. When ships passed, the drawbridge was raised, and after they passed, it was lowered to allow pedestrians, carriages, and horses to cross.</p>
<p>It is said that Wills spent 10,000 taels of silver to build this bridge, which was a considerable amount at the time. Of course, he wanted to recoup his investment, so he charged each person two cash coins each time they crossed, with carriages and horses paying double. However, some people at the time noticed that foreigners with high noses were not charged, which caused great dissatisfaction. In the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign, i.e., 1872, this newspaper was founded, and several short articles commented on this unfair fact. They can still be found in today's archives. In order to resist the foreigners' injustice, the various public offices prepared to purchase several charitable ferries to provide free passage for Chinese people, to see if the Garden Bridge would still have any business. Seeing the situation was not good, the Municipal Council had to make a compromise, saying: Foreigners have always paid, and even more, at ten cash coins each time. However, because foreigners are not accustomed to carrying loose change when they go out, this money is collected by the Municipal Council at the end of the month, they said. Whether this was true or false could not be verified.</p>
<p>In any case, due to the establishment of the charitable ferries, the business of Wills Bridge greatly declined. In the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi reign (1874), the Municipal Council finally bought it for a price.</p>
<p>However, a wooden bridge, used for so many years, certainly needed repair urgently. The Municipal Council, recognizing the increasing importance of the bridge, decided to replace the bridge piers and rebuild a steel bridge. This matter was overseen by Main, the director of the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council at the time. In order to accurately calculate the load-bearing capacity of the bridge deck, Main sent many people to sit guard at both ends of the bridge all day long on June 14, 15, and 16 in the fifteenth year of the Guangxu reign (1889), carefully counting the number of carriages, horses, and pedestrians passing by. According to the later announcement, it was as follows:</p>
<p>Carriages　16,333</p>
<p>Rickshaws　20,958</p>
<p>Freight Cars　22</p>
<p>Small Carts　2,759</p>
<p>Sedan Chairs　27</p>
<p>Horses　38</p>
<p>Western Pedestrians　1,645</p>
<p>Chinese Pedestrians　33,666</p>
<p>The above statistics may not be completely accurate, but they must be close. From this, one can imagine what the traffic situation on the Garden Bridge was like at that time. The reconstruction of the Garden Bridge officially began in the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign (1906) and was completed the following year. The bridge body is entirely made of steel, manufactured by the Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company in England. For nearly forty years, although there have been occasional minor repairs, it has remained largely unchanged. Last year, due to the long-term pressure of the Broadway Mansions on the eastern pier foundation, a gap developed between it and the bridge body, which was repaired by the Public Works Bureau.</p>
