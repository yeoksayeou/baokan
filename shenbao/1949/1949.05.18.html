<h3>社論　戰時防疫的重要</h3>
<p>這一週是上海的公共衛生週，由衛生局所發動所主持；它的主要目的有二！一為一般的衛生，一為清潔。當此日夜砲聲震耳的緊張局面下，衛生當局猶從容不迫地提倡公共衛生，其意義重大，其價值應重新估計。戰時移民頻繁，人口擁塞於幾處安全地帶，市民經濟困難，營養隨之不足，醫藥隨之不週；加之時值初夏，氣候乍寒乍熱，濕度高而雨水多，這都是使病菌繁殖傳播的好機會，在病魔踴躍欲試未發作前，以衛生之道予以當頭棒喝，防止病疫，實是一種最經濟最有效的賢明措施。公共衛生是一種戰爭，凡我市民必須人人參加這種防疫防病的戰爭。</p>
<p>公共衛生的意義照衛生學家溫斯洛指出，有二大重點，一曰增進健康，一曰延長壽命。而它的鑰匙則在控制傳染病。控制傳染病有二大問題，一係保護個人，另係保護社會。社會是個人的總積，社會為群眾的，政治的，經濟的所影響的複雜混合體。可使病疫容易蔓延，也可阻止病疫蔓延，是以控制個人疫病的政策必須吻合整個社會需要。公共衛生着重於社會，但亦不忽略個人，可是這裏有一個分寸，保護團體比保護個人來得重要，有時為了保護大眾團體不得不忍痛犧牲少數個人。</p>
<p>歷史告訴我們，傳染病控制經過三個時期，才能達到科學化，第一時期屬宗教性；其次為自然界時期，接下去即微生物時期。人類對病源觀念及其傳播態度，最初以為「二豎」等鬼神作崇，嗣後以為日月星辰氣候環境所造孽，洎乎十九世紀末，病疫由人傳人或獸傳人的信念稍見萌芽，舊約摩西　公共衛生規律承認疾病傳染有關人與人人與獸的接觸，以色列人禁止兒童吃豬肉或貝類，教人妥為處理糞便，不要與麻風人交接。迨一六七六年荷蘭黎霍克，始指出微生物的存在，并暗示此為病疫之來源。十九世紀中葉巴士德證明病疫確由微生物所致，病疫預防遂大大的展開。今日許多中國人民尚停留在我們祖父的世紀，對病疫仍莫明其妙　且多囿於迷信，這是提倡公共衛生的致命傷，我們必須多用點力量啟發他們，誘導他們。</p>
<p>歐美各國因為醫藥發達，并不惜在公共衛生上化錢，他們一致認為公共衛生的投資是最賺錢的投資，故傳染病在曲綫上降低了，甚至沒有地位了。吾國盛行的傷寒，霍亂，白喉，痢疾，猩紅熱和沙眼等等，他們早絕無僅有，要研究這些病時，非到東方來找不到很多的材料。西歐死亡率在一九四六和一九四七年　較戰前低。法國戰後　死亡率為有史以業最低，英吉利，威爾斯，荷蘭，比利時，丹麥，瑞典，挪威，瑞士諸國情形，都比較前好。德國獨不行。</p>
<p>美國去年稱為健康年，今年卻是更進步；他們平均壽命已近六十七歲，近年死亡率跌進百分之四十，一九〇〇年死亡率每千人十七點二；一九四〇年降至十點七；一九四七年又減到十點一。下面是一九〇〇年與一九四七年各種疾病的比較統計：（一）癆病每十萬人死二百，今則三十七點二，自死亡原因第一位至第七位。（二）肺炎由一百八十點五減到四十六點一，自第二位到第六位。（三）痢疾本有一百三十三點一，今為十四，可能由第三位退至第十五位。（四）心臟病原佔第四位，今佔第一位，自一百三十二點一增至三百零六點六。（五）腎臟炎本來八十九，佔死亡第六位，今減為五十八；但已升到第五位了。（六）腦出血昔列入第八位，今高至第三位，為九十點點五。（七）第十位為癌癥，每千人死六十五，現躍進第二位，死一百三十人。其他殺人如麻醉傳染病在美國已無足輕重了。只有生理病正在發愁。今年三四兩月美國醫學會報告，他們刻實施疾病保險制度，已有五二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇參加，同時「聯邦安全組織」聘請四萬行政人員從事衛生。教育和福利事業，據專家估計，他們至少將再添加四十萬至五十萬人員辦理全國衛生方案，每歲費用約自一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇至一八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美金。</p>
<p>我們今日公共衛生還要斤斤於天花，霍亂，傷寒，腦膜炎，白喉，痢疾上打念頭費氣力，實在可悲可恥。為民眾打防疫針時猶不能順利進行，偏要躲避，偏要作假，像這樣　社會豈得謂之文明！平日肺癆病每十萬人患者在三百以上，每分鍾將死去四人左右，全國肺癆人至少達一千五百萬。瘴氣即是瘻疾，終年流行，患者佔人口百分之十至五十以上，慘劇籠罩着大時代。性病也是可怕地在替我們掘墳墓，差不多百分之十以上被染到了，上海特別的多。此外戰時的壕溝熱和破傷風，傳染率也很驚人，此時應予特別預為之謀。夏令已至，清潔一事，不能再容忍忽略，夏季的瘟疫多從骯髒上得來的。窮的社會，清潔一道總還該做得到吧？</p>
<h3>經合總署報告　在華工作成績</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十六日電〕在一九四八年最後一季內，美國經濟合作總署在華之活動，雖因中國內戰關係而受到限制，但仍能完成相當程度之實際事業，使中國人民受惠非淺。</p>
<p>經合總署使中國沿海五大城市之糧食配給計劃能繼續進行，因而防止經濟之崩潰與一般之混亂。對於中國之主要之都市工業—即紡織業—提供有力之支持，因而保障無數工人之職業與急切需要之生產。該總署提供必要之石油產與煤斤，以便維持運輸業，電力厰及各種工業之工作，該總署使以前美國所供給之醫藥供應品與殺蟲劑獲後支配之便利。最後，經合總署利用聯合管理之對等基金，協助中國許多有價值之制度與計劃，不顧通貨膨脹與內戰而能計劃工作。</p>
<p>此等　實，透露在經合總署所公佈之一九四八年最後一季工作報告中，此一報告已由杜魯門總統轉達美國會。在此一時期內，中國政府所受軍事與經濟之挫折，報告內亦加以檢討，并說明：由於此等情形，經合總署「以有限之援華基金，實無法負起安定金融與復興經濟之廣廣泛問題」。</p>
<p>報告內註明：第四季內較大之購辦活動集中於各種物資如食米，小麥，麵粉，石油及棉花一類，但主要工業配備之購辦，則因軍事局勢不安定而暫告中止。</p>
<p>該報告謂，小麥與麵粉係供青島，北平與天津作為配給之用，至於食米，則係裝赴上海，南京，廣州與汕頭者。石油大部份為上海方面民營石油公司之存貨，而經此等公司在中國各地之設備加以分配。此外，每月約有原油二二五·〇〇〇桶自波斯灣裝赴台灣，以供提煉，然後再分配予中國大陸。</p>
<p>棉花大部份係運赴上海，尚有較小部份則運赴天津，青島與無錫。棉花經紡製後，係供輸齣及國內之消費，有時則用以交換本國所產之食物。</p>
<p>在該季中，農村復興聯合委會舉行第一次會議，并擬就各種計劃，藉以增加國內所缺乏之農產品之生產，成立執行中心以進行土地改革及促進公眾健康，農村社會教育與地方行政，并辦理大規模之成人教育。</p>
<p>在此一季中，對於對等基金之使用，業已擬就一种總　。當時曾同意一點，即自特別賬戶支取款項時，惟有在有緊急需要或可道生收縮通貨之效果時，始屬可能。該報告指出至十二月卅日為止，對等基金之總額計有金圓劵一五七·二八九·〇〇〇美元，業已支出者約等於五·八三九·〇〇〇美元，其中經合署在華行政費用約佔一·三四二·〇〇〇美元，美援運用委會之費用二·四九八·〇〇〇美元，特種計劃之費用一·八〇三·〇〇〇美元，大部份係用於河工。保健與福利工作方面　，工程服務費五三·〇〇〇美元。該報告并謂：「由於經合總署計劃中採　主要配備之計劃，本需提用大量對等基金之故」。</p>
<p>在此季中，該署開始與中國商人商談，俾便其產品能輸出至美國作儲存之用，初步之磋商在年尾已在進行中。但報告稱：由於交易之完成，有賴於商品及銀元之交換，而不能利用貶值之當地貨幣，故交易問題更形複雜。第八十屆國會已撥款二億七千五百萬元，作為實施經合署援華計劃之用。直至十二月卅一日為止，其中一憶九千五萬元業已化去。其後之經合署撥款已使援款總類迄今計達二億二千一百九十一萬八千元。車會最近延長經合署援華法案時期，使自原來之本年四月三日最後限期延長至一九五〇年二月十五日，原撥款之未用餘數，將用作此一時期之基金。</p>

<h3>聯大對弗朗哥西班牙　維持外交限制決議　義殖民地問題尚待表決　本屆聯大今明宣告結束</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十七日電〕本屆聯合國全體大會將於今日或明日閉幕，議程中尚有一大政治問題未決，卽義前殖民地之處置，迄今尚未獲有任何決議。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十六日電〕聯合國大會今夜維持其三年來對弗朗哥西班牙之禁令，但同時打消蘇聯集團對瑪德里政府實施經濟制裁之運動。兩案表決情形如下：</p>
<p>（一）關於拉丁美洲各國所提準許聯合國會員國復派大使與公使至瑪德里一案，表決票數為廿六對十五，十六票棄權，另兩國缺席，此案因未獲三分之二多數票，未能成立。（二）波蘭所提禁止聯合國會員國運輸軍火至西班牙，及限制對西班牙貿易案，以四十票對六票被否決，另七票棄權。投贊成票者僅蘇聯集團。美英兩國在表決第一案棄權，在表決第二案時投反對票。表決前波蘭代表卡茲索基否認英代表麥克尼爾所謂弗朗哥去年向波蘭訂購戰機。推進機及引擎五百件之說，並謂波蘭與西班牙絕無商業關係。西班牙問題告一段落後，大會休息至夜深再開，屆時將討論難民與流亡人民問題。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十七日電〕聯合國大會今晨開始辯論波蘭之另一建議，主張各國應加速撤退無國籍難民，波蘭南斯拉夫烏克蘭白俄羅斯及蘇聯各國代表紛紛指責西德佔領當局阻礙欲回至祖國各難民之撤退，而任國際難民機構將此項難民遣送至其他國家充當「奴役」，故要求採用一切方法以促進撤退難民工作，且對遣送至其他國家之難民加以管制。結果此提議以卅一票對六票，十四票棄權被否決。</p>
<h3>葛羅米柯抵巴黎　傳共情局在莫斯科開會　東歐國家均派代表參加</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十六日電〕蘇聯外次莨羅米柯與同行之蘇聯代表之十一人，已於今日下午自紐約飛抵此間。蘇聯駐法大使波各莫洛夫在機塲歡迎。葛氏下機後，拒絕對記者發表任何聲明，僅謂，彼將於明日或後日離此前往莫斯科。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十六日電〕此間消息靈通人士今日稱：共產國際情報局之秘密會議，已在莫斯科召開，「東歐集團」各國代表皆列席參加。同一方面謂，此乃若干德國社會統一黨領袖目下不在柏林之原因。彼等認為此會議之召開，乃圖在巴黎四國外長會議前，重行討論國際共黨自大戰後所取之政策。</p>
<h3>英外相貝文　定週五赴法</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕英駐德軍事總督羅勃森，今日自德來此，與外交部有所接洽。渠定週三赴巴黎，會同其他英代表準備四強外長會議。又據外部發言人稱，貝文將於週五偕外次漢特森離英赴巴黎。</p>
<h3>華萊士演說　建立世界和平　提出六項目標</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十七日電〕美國進步黨領袖華萊士昨夜在此間美迪遜廣塲演說稱，和平之希望，已使所有人民之心弦為之震動。巴黎之四國外長會議應將此種希望形成確實之協議。華氏繼稱，四國外長會議之目標，應為（一）解決德國問題，確保德國之戰爭潛力不致再度興起；（二）削減軍備，尤其為一切重大之毀滅性武器；（三）停止自一國輸出軍火至另一國；（四）恢復世界貿易，不具任何限制；（五）全世界人民能自一國移居至另一國；（六）美蘇兩國間自由交換科學知識。</p>
<h3>伊朗獨裁政權　正在醞釀中</h3>
<p>憲兵仍歸陸軍指揮</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十六日電〕「紐約時報」駐德黑蘭記者自可靠方面獲悉，德黑蘭美官方人士獲悉伊王準備將憲兵指揮權交還陸軍部後，頗感驚異。蓋此乃趨向獨裁制的顯明步驟，此舉將使軍權集中於贊成設立獨裁政府的軍人。按美國於一九四二年起，卽協助伊朗改組憲兵隊，經美顧問團力爭之下，始將憲兵隊交與內政部，成為純粹的警察部隊，不使直隸陸軍部指揮。按伊朗之陸軍亦如南美之陸軍，在政治上擔任主要任務。目前伊王之交，卽係先發動政變，成為陸軍部長，然後逐步成為總理，並自稱為王。近傳伊現任參謀長拉斯馬拉主張在伊建立獨裁，仍以伊王李薩為王。渠則為伊王之臂助，俾大權得以獨攬。憲兵歸陸軍部指揮之說如經證實，則將為伊朗民主發展的最大威脅。</p>
<h3>的黎波里民眾　反對義託管　示威運動擴大</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅十七日電〕開羅今夜接到消息，的黎波里上週開始之示威運動，現聲勢浩大，示威者作高呼反對義國之口號外，且要求里比亞之統一，而置於鄰境西倫尼加名義的主治者賽諾西統治下。按的黎波里之政黨本相分立，大都反對由賽諾西統治該地，茲因貝文史福薩計劃主張將的黎波里於一九五一年後歸義國託管，各黨受此忿激，皆泯除異見，於是發電至彭哈齊請賽諾西宣佈為利比亞王。的黎波里之回教堂今日已縣賽諾西之旗號。按里比亞包括的黎波里與西倫尼加兩地。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社彭哈齊十七日電〕的黎波里反對貝文史福薩計劃並要求完全獨立之示威風潮，現已傳至西倫尼加。今日有示威者攻擊英國警察，並撕毀英國旗，若干建築上已高懸賽諾西之旗號，並由示威者攜此旗歡呼庭院行各街道，當局已取特別安全計劃，以防事勢之擴大。</p>
<h3>波蘭新流亡政府　在倫敦成立</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十六日電〕此間波蘭流亡人士今晚宣佈成立一新流亡政府，以代五星期前解體之前流亡政府。新政府之人選由流亡政府總統柴里斯基任命如下：總理托瑪茲伍斯基，內長奧茲秦斯基，外長索基洛斯基，移民部長林克。按前流亡政府之解體，乃前總理鮑爾斯將軍之辭職所促成者。</p>
<h3>美共和黨參議員　主張軍事援華</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕共和黨參議員諾蘭今日透露，一部份共和黨參議員將嘗試推動二億元之軍事援華計劃。據稱，「此事將在參院討論政府十四億五千萬元之全面軍事援外計劃時一併提出，余以為吾人可獲足夠票數，使軍事援華計劃，列入整個援外計劃。」按政府要求以十一億三千萬元援助大西洋條約各國重整軍備，另以三億二千萬元援助希臘與土耳其，但因巴黎四外長會議舉行在卽，故政府領袖並不加速推動此計劃。民主黨參院外委會主席康納利與民主黨領袖羅卡斯，同意此際並無迅速行動之迫切需要。又外委會討論北大西洋條約已近尾聲，可望於十八日結束加以批準。</p>
<h3>南韓感受侵略威脅　籲請美軍事援助　希望締結太平洋公約</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十六日電〕南韓總統李承晚之私人代表趙炳今日對報界發表文告稱，南韓「在任何時間」可能遭受蘇聯的侵略，並要求美國對支持韓國的領土完整，作軍事保證。趙氏證實蘇聯·中共主北韓共產黨政府已組成「實際上的同盟」，並稱，南韓希望在遭受外國侵略或遭受外國控制的國內侵略時，自美國獲得軍事支援的確定保證。</p>
<p>趙氏稱，南韓需要供給常備軍十萬人以及警察及後備軍十萬人的軍事配備，截至目前為止，「美國僅供給韓國約三萬八千人的配備，顯然，吾人需要更多的軍事援助。」</p>
<p>「聯合社漢城十六日電」朝鮮總統李承晚今日發表聲明，再向美國呼籲稱，余提議在下列三事中採取其一，以解決共產主義侵略勢力對南韓及亞洲之嚴重威脅，卽（一）締結太平洋條約，與大西洋條約相似。（二）由美國與南韓單獨成立協定，實行聯防反對任何國家。（三）發表公開宣言，擔保防衛，統一民主與獨立的韓國，俾與杜魯門總統之反共政策相符。</p>

<p>英對波抗議予以駁斥</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十六日電〕美國務院發言人今日證實司法部已請英政府引渡逃至英國被逮之美共產黨員艾斯勒。本月十三日曾將此請電達美國駐倫敦大使轉致英政府。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十六日電〕波蘭駐英大使米卡洛夫斯基今日對英國警察在波蘭郵船上逮捕德籍共產黨員艾思勒事，提出口頭抗議。謂英當局未獲波蘭領事或船主之許可，卽上船逮捕艾氏，為違反國際公法之舉。英國外交部發言人則於今晚稱，逮捕艾思勒，並不違反國際公法。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十六日電〕英內長艾特今日在下院宣稱，艾斯勒犯偽造證件罪，按照英美引渡條約，應在引渡之列。艾斯勒曾破壞保釋之諾，而私自逃亡，美大使館曾請蘇桑普頓地方官下狀逮捕之。旋有警員登波蘭船巴托里號，向船長聲明，如船長允將本船留泊原地至下午，以待此事續加考慮，延緩執行逮捕。因船長不允，該警員乃卽執行逮捕。至是共黨議員乃卽執行逮捕。至是共黨議員迦拉契起立大呼，議長乃命迦氏遵守秩序，艾特嗣答左翼議員齊里亞克斯與米爾斯之問話，謂此案現正由一地方官審問，渠將決定美政府申請引渡之法律點，如波蘭政府申請逮捕乘美船之一人，則亦將同樣辦理。迦拉契於是圖將該案作全面辯論，議長不允，謂此案最要之一點，為應則法庭審問，下院不能干預之。</p>
<h3>出席巴黎和會中共代表　談中共決策路線　依附蘇聯不容有狄托存在</h3>
<p>〔路透社普拉格十七日電〕中國共產黨領袖願使中共執行正宗的共產主義政策，彼等深知西方國家希望中共能成為東方的狄托，故正竭力防止中共有此等趨勢。前項意見，至少是出席巴黎世界和平大會中共代表團的意見。代表團在此間受安全警察嚴密保護，西方國家記者欲與彼等晤面殊不可能。曾有西方記者數人圖與中國代表晤面，但談未數語，卽遭隨行之警探阻止。</p>
<p>但就代表之一錢宗綏（譯音）向捷克共黨記者發表之談話，以及自其他方面所獲之情報綜合而觀，顯示中共亦擬實施共產情報局為各人民民主國所決定的政策。外交觀察家認為此次出席和平大會之中國代表團，為足以充份代表中共的權威性代表團，因此他們所發表關於中共決策的言論，確實値得重視。代表之一北京大學經濟學教授錢宗綏氏曾向捷克記者鄭重聲明，「中國沒有，不致有亦不能有任何狄托存在，中國人民的勝利是一個國際政策的結果」。熟悉共產黨名各站的人，一聞便知錢氏之意在否認中共有轉變為國家共產主義者的趨勢。錢氏又強調「中國人民頗受蘇聯及人民民主權利的鼓勵。」觀察家指出這是在承認蘇聯及紅軍具有超乎其他國家的實力，這正是狄托元帥所輕視的一點。錢氏又說，「在政治上，中共將自蘇聯的經騐中獲得教訓」。這種表示又與歐洲正宗共產黨人的態度完全吻合。錢氏又說，「新中國將為一個向社會主義看齊的人民民主國」，這正與捷克共產黨的態度相同。一年來捷共始終採用同一公式，以形容其本身的地位。捷共所標榜者為無產階級在共產黨領導之下，並根據馬克斯·列寗·史達林的演說，及自莫斯科共黨經騐所獲的教訓，第一步先打倒反對勢力，然後建立獨裁政權，組織人民民主。按人民民主，不過是推進共產主義的第一個階段，社會主義乃為其第二階段。目前已達到第二階段者，祗有蘇聯一國，共產主義乃第三亦卽最後一個階段。在此階段之下，國家在理論上已趨於消失，沒有階級的社會發展完成，人類一律平等的目的始告達到。就中國言，目前尚在最早階段，因為它的「人民民主式」的政府尚待組成。任何人民民主政府的初步工作之一，為使國家工業化。列寗與史達林都認為工業界的無產階級最能予以充分信任，農民雖亦可參加，但土地所有權終是一個重大的危險因素，足以增減資本主義。職是之故，共產黨情報局去年的通函對此點極度重視。在其對狄托的譴責中，指其處理農村問題時犯有各種錯誤。就中共言，對於此點似頗有心得。錢氏表示「中共第一要務，在將農業國的中國變為工業國，在這一方面，應向蘇聯過去所獲得的教訓多多學習」按蘇聯當初第一步卽將一切土地收為國有，然後再處理此等土地，結果引起大飢荒與大流亡。今人民民主國有蘇聯前車之鑒，是將農村逐步改革，待時機成熟，再將土地收為國有。</p>

<h3>裕仁巡視日南部　為期約歷四星期</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十七日電〕日皇裕仁今晨九時率隨員二十人，離此搭專車至九州，作二十七日之巡行。屆時將檢閱該島之文化工業及社會情形，且訪問各城市，包括曾受原子彈轟炸之名古屋。此間觀察家謂，裕仁自日本之新憲法成立後，卽常出外旅行與新憲法成立後，卽常出外旅行與人民接觸，圖恢復其聲望。但自一九四七年十二月以後，因等待東條等戰犯之判決，曾暫時中止活動。目下此事已成為過去，故彼又可自由出外巡行。按九州向為戰前日本極端愛國份子之活動中心，目下亦為極右與極左份子之集中地。日本各報謂，裕仁出巡時，將親自償付彼與其隨員之川資，一反由各地方政府負擔之向例。</p>
<h3>東德選舉議會代表　初步結果昨揭曉　反對票多於贊成票出人意料</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十七日電〕東德選舉人民議會今日已告結束，初步揭曉使共產黨大失所望。據東柏林選舉總委員會宣布，最初開出七千票中，贊成「人民議會」者二·八二〇票，反對者竟達三·八〇九票，廢票約二五〇張。</p>
<p>一部份選票上書「我們不贊成警察國家，我們反對共產主義」。選舉委員會已奉命暫時停止點票，以待覆核。選舉最後結果將由共產黨控制之人民委員會發表之。同時，蘇聯軍機關報則指責德國分裂派天主教民主黨與自由民主黨口是心非，表面佯為効忠人民大會，暗中則煽動人民反對，投反對票之選舉人必定中其奸計無疑。</p>
<p>〔合眾社柏林十七日電〕共方官員今晨已完成對「人民大會」的選票計數，但拒絕宣佈任何結果，此舉顯已證實報載選舉結果，顯示選民對共黨提出的候選人名單，反對多於贊成的報道。柏林西區報紙稱：選民半數以上均拒絕共黨指定的候選人。官方嗣後宣佈，選舉結果將於十八日公佈。</p>

<h3>西歐受援國工業生產　漸恢復戰前水準　美經合總署發表工作成績報告</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕杜魯門總統今日向國會提出一九四八年度冬季經合總署工作報告稱，歐洲方面受馬歇爾計劃資助各國經濟情形進步滿意，預料至今年六七月間，各該國美元短少情勢，可改善百分之三十。杜氏同時警告歐洲各國如欲於一九五二年底馬歇爾計劃滿期時獨立自給，必須完成大規模經濟發展及改革。杜氏稱，歐洲接受美援各國共同努力恢復經濟健康已完成第一階段，大體上業已達到戰前生產水平。惟此尚不足，各國該必須竭力設法超過戰前水平而後可。就歐洲經濟合作機構上九四八年七月至一九四九年六月工作計劃而觀，其去年十二月底之成績，可稱滿意。在一九四八年至一九四九年財政年度生產及貿易目標已有達到之把握，本金及流水賬項下黃金及美鈔計短少五五億元，上屆財政年度計短少七八億元，已減少百分之三十，僅有數國復興速度稍落後。惟第二階段方才開始，此一階段以達到經濟獨立所必要之最高度生產為目標，在此一階段結束前，西歐生產必須超過戰前水準。總統報告並稱一九四七年間，西歐各國財力所能償付之進口貨不到百分之四十，現可望償付半數。如欲輸出輸入達到平衡，尚須加緊努力，尤須注重革新工業，改良出口以適應市塲，開發海外屬地，減少貿易障礙，以歐洲名勝吸引遊客。西歐經濟之基本改革祗能逐漸為之，美援實為其復興之必要部份。</p>

<h3>市長發表告市民書　糧食燃煤供應決可無虞　應幫助軍隊保衛大上海</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕陳市長於昨日下午五時，在市府會議室招待記者，發表書面談話「告上海市民書」如下：良受命於上海面臨戰爭之際，危疑震憾，曷勝惶悚。惟念上海為全國經濟中心，百年締造，成就匪易，保全維護，責無旁貸，用敢以臨深腹薄之心，勉為焦頭爛額之人，敬掬衷誠，以告全市同胞，祈求能力合作，庶幾同舟共濟。第一，生活至上，民食第一：上海居民達六百萬，平時生活之維持，已甚艱鉅，況在戰時。故今日市政之第一課題，卽為如何維持市民之生活，使其不過分感受戰爭之沉重壓迫，於此，良敢鄭重昭告全市同胞，糧食，燃煤之供應，市府已會同有關機關籌有確實數量，決可不虞匱乏。貧苦市民之平價配售，尤當增加數量，俾能維持最低需要。第二，治安至上，安定第一：上海雖面臨戰爭，但保衛上海之軍力，定能予攻擊者以打擊，上海必仍是三民主義者之上海。因此，良特祈求全面全市同胞，在此保衛大上海戰役中，各安於職業崗位，並積極參加各種自衛組織，以增強本市治安力量，遏止奸諜之活動，戢弭暴徒這煽亂，以確保上海之安定，而不受戰爭之影響。第三，支持作戰，軍民聯合：環上海市作戰之國軍，堅強忠勇，必能制勝疆塲。在一切為上海，一切為戰爭之前提下，上海市民必須竭盡可能幫助軍隊，願為人民保衛大上海。第四，維護生產，勞資互助：上海為一工業都市，勝利開始，本已有復蘇之象，只以各處戰亂頻仍，國內市塲日蹙，景象於是日益蕭條。今則面臨戰爭，停業不可，維持無法，工商業者處境之苦，不難想像。時在今日，資方固宜顧全勞方之生活，勞方亦當體念資方之困難，艱危互救，困苦共嘗。至於市府，自當竭盡所能，調劑協助，冀所以渡過今日之難關，而為明日保留復興之基礎。第五，革興政治，肅清貪汚：革新政治，端在力行。肅清貪汚，淘汰無能，節省財力物力，提高行政效率，良已具有決心。惟自上而下，事難適合乎現實，深望市府同仁，全市同胞，舉其所見，以告市府，本人定當竭誠接受。市府中如有貪臟枉法作奸犯科者，尤望隨時檢舉，以期振衰起敝，興頑立懦。第六，穩定經濟，消滅投機：上海被稱為冒險者之樂園，熙熙而來，攘攘而往，十晨洋塲，幾無不籠罩在投機氛圍中。此在平時，已足擾亂市塲，波動人心，使經濟生活無法求得正常。至於戰時，則更是推波助瀾，為敵人張目。因此，良對於今日上海之經濟肆應，是決定於管制中求穩定，一切商塲投機行為，將以最大努力予以消滅，務使工商業者能於正常之市塲率中，獲得合理之生存。第七，世界一家，中外合作，上海為一國際都市，市民不分國界，休戚皆屬一　　體。今日雖面臨戰爭，對於外僑之生命財產，市府自當依據國際約章，予以嚴密保護，但亦望外僑團體本世界一家之誼，推誠合作，以渡今日之危局。第八，專家政治，建設上海：上海是永存的。今日雖面臨戰爭，但吾人決不因戰爭而將上海之建設事業置之腦後。建設上海之藍圖，在吾人意念中，是嶄新而具體的，戰爭與建設本可相輔而行，因此，良對於當前之市政設施，雖在應付戰局，維持現狀，而根本大計，則仍在如何描繪建設上海之藍圖。敦聘專家，相與努力，假以時日，深信必能使上海成為人民之樂園。以上所舉，皆卑之無甚高論，惟為政不在多言，固貴力行何如。良固為上海六百萬人之公僕，但政治究為眾人之事。故今日上海六百萬同胞所應努力者，為如何監督並推動市府實事求是，由下而上，精誠團結，使民主進步之新生力量，得以迅速長成，並以堅定不亂之行動，共同穩渡當前之戰爭局面，息壤在彼，質諸明日。</p>

<p>央行遵警備部政委會令，僑匯暫不掛牌後，今後僑匯仍酌量按照外匯移轉證市價折付，故已無掛牌之必要。該證滬市與華南廣州等地均可自由買賣，當無不便。目前外匯證流通滬市者，估計約在二百萬美金左右。</p>
<p>外匯移轉證市況，昨日突見回上，此係美鈔比率太低故也。晨開一百六十萬元售出，小至一百五十萬元有成交，旋因金鈔上升，故亦哄上，高達二百萬元外，終為二百一二十元，較上日軋升六十萬元。</p>

<h3>市場不見到貨　米價繼續上升</h3>

<p>茶市仍因實銷衰微，買氣猶豫，交易毫無做開。而其趨勢，在呆定多時中，昨亦猛力反動，價格方面，一致衝破原陣，向前進攻。揆其原因，黃金盛勢未衰，頻將人心激挺。執戶喊價，登峯造極，臨收結果，每擔軋升六七千萬元不等，腳地亦頗鞏固。</p>
<h3>桐油續挺</h3>
<p>桐油昨市趨勢續挺，行情再創破天荒高峯。緣因業外物資均告迭漲，尤以黃金一路猛竄，益使人心亢奮。賣方哄抬未已，過程卒又雀躍，惟買氣式微，交易終難轉機。</p>

<h3>武岡城步　暗影重重</h3>
<p>〔長沙訊〕「城步人心惶惶，武岡一夕數驚」根據一個頃自城步來長沙的人閑談，這句話概括了城步武岡的近況。城步和武岡是湘西南的邊陲，當這大局動邊時，湘西邊陲首先放起了野火，這野火一直還在燃燒着，而今尹立言（陸大畢業生，曾任南京華夏日報社長）他們却想把這野火延蔓到西南來。——邊陲地區的野心家在活躍，人民却在呻吟。</p>
<p>尹立言現在自稱為「湘鄂川陜黔總司令兼湖南省政府主席」，他戴起偌大的一個帽子，雖是虛張聲勢，却也有點動人，尤其對一般鄉愚和一般反側份子，也不無一點誘惑作用。在城步，靠綏寗邊境，聽說已有人取得聯絡，最近在西岩市的附近（距城步縣城八十里，距武岡縣城四十里）發現匪徒活動，西岩警察所日間派警到處搜剿，又無踪跡，夜間為了免得「被摸」，却不得不把人槍拖到其他的地方宿營。派人去勸導他們，他們却說：「我們都是本地人，怎麼會受尹立言的利用呢！」</p>
<p>「武岡莫新春股人槍約八百餘，踞塘渡口塘田市和白倉三角地帶，柳瓊踞西北鄉的鄧家舖，劉鎭國踞山門，這些角色，都直接間接與尹立言發生關係。武岡的保警部隊也曾和他們碰了兩下，結果是張震卿的警察隊雖然把劉鎭國打敗了，還繳了他幾枝槍，謝光明的警察隊却被柳瓊吃去了六十幾枝。他們的傳單標語和佈告曾一度貼到武岡縣城去了，大意是說：不久我們就要進城，希望人民不要自相驚擾。</p>
<p>聽說莫新春，柳瓊他們都想向城步發展，打算經黃橋舖過新（寗）武（岡）邊境，進攻城步的威溪鄉，搶奪西岩市的自衛武器：尹立言却也命駐黃土塘的「警備營長」袁某假道綏寗海口包圍城步縣城，他們認為城步這地方進可以攻，退可以守，加以糧食也相當豐富，而自衛槍枝却更使他們垂涎三丈，這才起了染指的野心。又一說城步已有土共在活動，第六區專員公署看清了城步的危機，就近特派一個視察去佈防，經過幾度會議，只得到一個結果，就是把原駐縣城的自衛隊調駐西岩。防衛莫新春的竄擾。</p>
<p>目前城步還有股匪或散匪打家刦舍的驚擾，隣縣綏寗武岡都頻頻告緊，關於綏寗的流言更多，有的說該縣某些自衛武力已起了動搖，雖不一定都是事實，但對人心的刺激却很大。而在城步內部，却還是照樣明爭暗鬥，鬧得不可開交。</p>
<p>除了這個未來的隱憂之外，那就是貪污的傳說了。街頭巷尾，酒後茶餘，貪污的傳說，都成了一般人的談助。據說，要想當一個鄉長，都要用錢買，城廟附近的鄉長，要光洋三百元一個，遠鄉也要一兩百。現在城步已看不到報紙和外來的郵件了，老百姓們好像都被塞在一個黑暗的洞裏，不知道外面已成了一個怎樣的世界；大家都猜想着：一兩個月內，恐怕會有一個可怕的局面來臨。」</p>
<h3>膠着狀態中的滇西</h3>
<p>— 正川</p>
<p>〔昆明訊〕不久以前，土共在滇南陷石屏，團蒙自，兇鋒所及，滇越路交通為之中斷；同一時間，滇東方面的土共，佔路南，攻宜良，直叩昆明大門，弄得人心震動，惶惶然不可終日。</p>
<p>在這種形勢下，當軸不得不以全力對付，於是，廿六軍的主力調集迤南，原來駐在滇西的綏靖保定團，也絡續調回昆明，滇南的危殆才算鬆馳和緩下來。</p>
<p>土共隊伍都是出身農村，從未見世面，為求生活才挺而走險。這些無訓練組織的莊稼漢們，給中央軍一打，就立刻招待不住，像聲勢煊赫一時的萬保邦部，節節敗退，一瀉百里，退到滇越邊境。</p>
<p>可是，土共為了避重就輕，和中央軍「捉迷藏」似的，在滇南沉靜以後，滇西卻又多事起來。保安團撤返昆明不久，蒙化縣應聲而動，造反的是當地一個地主土豪李碩生。奇怪的是當局在事前竟懵懵然，當糊里糊塗的還要委派他湖化縣長，李碩生在得到消息的翌日便帶着他的私人隊伍，幕然闖入縣城，實行武裝接收縣政府，當過省參議員，辦過報紙的原任縣官何少誠，夢也想不到禍從天降，給李碩生「活捉了」。原來何李之間早有間隙，因為何曾奉令剷烟，把李的烟苗——財富剷掉了，李現在要報復，清算那筆烟帳，要何少誠賠償損失，每顆烟苗定價二角錢（半開銀幣），李還想致何於死地，後來幸得某些當地耆紳從中勸說，何才得免於難，但傳聞何的太太，卻受到了酷刑——頭發被火燒光。</p>
<p>李碩生佔了蒙化，竟打出了什麼「民主聯軍」的旗號，公然和盧漢為敵。這把可怕的野火燃燒起來，正在動亂不安的週鄰各縣，紛紛向李碩生「看齊」，彌渡，景束，雲縣，昌寗，緬寗，——相繼叛變。</p>
<p>接着，滇西重鎭——滇緬公路的大站保山，也由前任縣長楊恒洲，和團管區已免職的司令張鎭英，領銜叛亂，昆明早就接到保山要「反」的情報，在四月十一號那天，昆明和保山間的電訊聯絡中斷</p>
<p>翌日，後山陷落情變獲證證實，叛變武裝深夜攻入城垣，火燒縣政府，縣長下落不明，搶掠縣銀行，經理和其他耆紳多人，被槍殺，全城大火秩序混亂，歹徒乘機搶劫，善良的老百姓遭遇了一塲大災難。</p>
<p>保山陷落，惡耗傳來，不但牽動整個滇西，連昆明也給震動了，因為保山是本省四大縣之一，縣城區域寬宏，商業發達，是滇緬交通孔道。</p>
<p>楊恒洲佔領保山，續向外圍擴張，西面的騰衝縣首當其衝，情勢岌岌可危，急電省府呼救。保山東北的永平縣，十三日亦陷於騒動中，永平是貧瘠的小土城，變亂武裝攻它，為的是借路。東進下關——這個抗戰時暴發的商業區，錢多物資多，自然是成為被覬視的對象，楊的隊伍，還將滇緬公路兩大險要工程——功果橋和惠通橋佔領，目的是憑據這兩地的天然險要，進可以攻，退可以守。</p>
<p>滇西半壁版圖土崩瓦解，滇緬公路已節節遮斷，省政府當局組織了一個滇西清剿總部，設在大理府，大理八屬實行大聯防，軍部設在大理，由滇西師管區司令周樹勳主持其事。</p>
<p>到現在為止，滇西的局勢似乎在膠着，叛變武裝，耽耽的虎視着下關和大理，但卻不敢去攻堅碰硬，而官方呢，增援的保安團已經趕到，但迄未見展開反攻，收復失地，各縣變亂如故。</p>
<p>烽火遍地，狼烟處處，滇西給糜爛了！</p>
<h3>台灣新竹市長　對警員鬥法</h3>
<p>— 谷亮</p>
<p>三月一日陳主席在台北召開全省行政會議時，靜如止水的新竹政壇，激起了不大不小的波紋，這件事聽說還搞到警備總司令部呢！原因是這樣：</p>
<p>日歷一頁一頁地撕去了九十多張，新竹市的公教人員眼看着物價一天天地高漲；台北傳來的消息是在一月底借二月份的薪俸，二月初又加發一個月的薪俸，到二月中旬再借三月份薪俸，再後又傳來從二月份起調整待遇的一連串的好消息，可是距離台北僅二時半火車里程的新竹，僅在過舊歷年時，職員每人先借三萬元，伕役二萬元外，一直到三月開始，還沒有發一月份薪俸的消息。他們已經被迫到不能再生活下去了，內心的抑　終於暴發出來，首先由警察局的職員發起上報告給陳主席，訴說生活困難的情形，請求省政當局予以合理解決，這張報告是在三月三日推選代表X君親自到台北投遞，X君首先到省政府會議會塲，因為門禁森嚴，報告沒有辦法直接送給陳主席，於是去到主席官邸，鵠候門首，可是等了半天，還沒有等到，好容易拜托了一個朋友，才把那張報告放到主席的辦公桌上。</p>
<p>行政會議中輪到新竹市長陳貞彬報告的時候，傳說陳主席曾問陳市長：「新竹市田賦征實達九成以上，其他稅收成績，諒亦不錯，為什么公教人員薪俸發不出來？」市長紅了臉，無話可答。散會以後，財政廳的一位某科長告訴了陳市長，說這是陳主席的話是根據你新竹市公務員的報告而說的。（因為那張報告已經發到財政廳辦理）。陳市長聽到這消息，無名火直衝宵漢，一回到新竹，馬上叫來警察局的主任秘書，問是什麼人搞的，回答說「不曉得」。又問「警察局人有沒有亦在一起搞？」回答是「大概沒有吧！」這事實是一批寅吃卯糧的小公務員搞的，并沒有與上級人員商過量，所以市長查不出一個究竟。第二天，派員到財政廳抄來報告人的姓名，一查對，原來大部份都是警察局的員警，於是大發雷霆，拍案大呌：「警察局與我搗蛋，這些人（指上報告的人）都是共產黨，非嚴辦不可」！立即諭知市府主任秘書陳叔良，傳審報告上名列前茅的警局二職員，并命令警察局長將這些人撤職。這時剛巧碰到發二月份薪俸（舊待遇），市長將各機關的薪俸支付書都答發了，祇留下一張警察局的，說：「非將上報告的人名字取消，決不發餉」，這批上報告的小公務員看市長這付樣子，亦在開會討論對付方法，一方面再向上級陳情，一面分頭收集罪證，要檢舉市長的貪污。警察局長一看形勢不對，就親自出面來做好做歹，引咎自責，并且要上報告的人寫悔過書。這樣一來，市長卻認為局長在故意縱容部屬與他搗蛋，一氣就跑到台北，告訴警備處的王處長說警察局長故意與他「搗蛋」，一方面向警備總司令部報告，說「警察局的職員都是共產黨！」警部的人聽得嚇了一跳，「有這等事？」連忙派人到新竹去密查，查得的結果是「并非事實」。這批被指認為共產黨的窮公務員，因之又在討論對付的方法，這　鬧劇，將來還不知如何收塲呢！</p>

<h3>Three Nine and Bai Long Harbors See National Army Landing; Pudong Annihilation Battle Unfolds; Communist Troops Heavily Defeated on the Yuepu and Yangxing Line, Total Collapse; Confrontation in Areas such as Zhuanqiao and Xinzhuang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, City Dispatch] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report: (1) Bandit 28th and 29th Armies bypassed our forward troops from the Taicang and Changshu directions, and raided positions at places like Shizilin, Yuepu, Yangxing, and Liuhang, launching strong attacks under the cover of artillery fire, attempting to cut off our Wusong throat. We had long been aware of their conspiracy and had made strong preparations in the area. In recent days, with the coordination of our army, navy, air force, infantry, artillery, and tanks, we have inflicted annihilating blows on the enemy. In total, over 12,000 bandits have been killed or wounded, and more than one regiment of personnel and weapons has been captured. The 29th Army has been completely disintegrated, and the two divisions of the 28th Army are also exhausted. Their final attack on the night of the 16th failed, and they collapsed across the board on the morning of the 17th. Our army, navy, air force, and armored units are in pursuit. (2) The bandit 27th Army, advancing along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, is in confrontation with us in Zhuanqiao Town, Xinzhuang Town, Qibao, and Hongqiao Airport. (3) The bandit 21st and 31st Armies separately encountered our forward troops in Zhoupu Town and Chuansha County in Pudong, resulting in fierce battles. The bandits suffered setbacks and retreated. There were minor contacts south of Sanlin Town and east of Lujia Town. (4) Our powerful corps are now coordinating with the navy to land at Bailong Harbor and Sanjiu Harbor, launching an attack on the enemy's flanks. Another annihilation battle in Pudong has already begun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, City Dispatch] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report: (1) At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 17th, the National Army once again achieved brilliant results in the Niujiaojian area. At dawn, a bandit battalion blindly charged into the fire sea in front of our Niujiaojian position, attempting to exploit a gap. The defending troops maneuvered to open the mouth of the bag, luring the bandits deep inside, blocking them with firepower from the front, and launching a destructive bombardment with intensive artillery fire. After three hours of fierce fighting, the bandit battalion was unable to resist on the ground and laid down their weapons one after another. Our army captured over 60 bandits alive, including the bandit political commissar, and seized five light machine guns, 30 submachine guns, and 120 rifles. (2) In this Songhu Defense War, officers and soldiers of the National Army bravely killed the enemy, and there are many touching acts of loyalty and bravery. A report from the front line in Yuepu stated that a certain platoon leader of a certain champion unit was ordered to lead his platoon to defend the Xth important bunker in front of the position. For days, the bandit army repeatedly used human wave tactics to launch wave-like charges against our position. Due to our mobile operations, some bunkers were lost and regained repeatedly. After losing contact with the command post during the fierce battle, the platoon leader was still able to respond calmly, stubbornly holding this bunker alone for three days. The brothers of the entire platoon endured hunger and defended against the bandits in a tense atmosphere. They had not eaten for two days. Although the bandit army repeatedly approached and made fiery appeals, the platoon leader remained unmoved. It was not until our reinforcements arrived to counterattack yesterday morning and drove the bandits away that they discovered the red flag waving in the wind on this important stronghold. However, the entire platoon was already exhausted from hunger and thirst. (3) After 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th, the defending artillery in the Liugan area continuously bombarded the bandit army's position in the southwest corner. According to the confession of a captured bandit yesterday morning, the bandit army's fortifications were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the bandit army in Pudong is currently inactive under the suppression of our army's artillery fire.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, City Dispatch] The Songhu Defense Headquarters released the battle situation on the morning of the 17th:</p>
<p>(1) The main force of the bandit 28th Army, which invaded Yangxing, suffered heavy casualties after being severely attacked by our army and air force for days. Most of the detailed battle results have been seen in previous reports. At dawn today, its remaining troops have been forced to retreat westward. There are currently no traces of bandits in front of the Yangxing position.</p>
<p>(2) Over a thousand bandits who fled from Fengxian arrived in Zhoupu on the 16th and came into contact with the champion unit. An elite unit of ours is currently rushing to the area to reinforce and counterattack. The bandit army is attacked from both sides and can be wiped out.</p>
<p>(3) The bandits who fled to the Chuansha area, numbering approximately 2,000, continued to flee north yesterday and engaged in fierce battles with our blocking troops. As of press time, the battle is still ongoing.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, City Dispatch) Military sources report: Our army has achieved an unprecedented victory on the Shanghai northwest front since the start of the Shanghai defense war. Military officials state: The main forces of the Communist army's 28th and 29th armies on the Shizilin, Yuepu, Yangxing, Luodian, and Liuhang line have suffered heavy blows from our heroic soldiers in recent days and completely collapsed last night. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy, seizing countless spoils. The battle results are currently being tallied.</p>
<h3>Wusong Outer Periphery Enters Pudong District; Air Force Conducts Intense Low-Altitude Bombing Yesterday; Air Supremacy All Day Assists Battle, Achieving Results</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, City Dispatch] Air Force Headquarters reports: Yesterday was the sixth day of the Shanghai Defense War, with the focus still on the fierce fighting in the outer periphery of the Wusong District fortress. The six divisions of Chen Yi's 28th and 29th Armies, which have been attacking Yuepu, Yangxing, and Liuhang for the past five days, have suffered casualties of approximately more than half. The battle situation was slightly quieter on the 16th. Starting at 3:00 AM on the morning of the 17th, the Communist army launched an offensive again in the rain. The two sides first engaged in intense artillery battles, followed by fierce close combat in the Yuepu, Yangxing, and Liuhang areas. In Yuepu Town alone, the Communist army launched attacks seven times. Ultimately, with the coordination of our army, navy, and air force, the majority of the invading enemy was annihilated. In addition to supporting the Wusong fortress area with a large number of aircraft, the Air Force discovered that the Communist army in the Pudong District was also gradually gathering, attempting to approach the east bank of the Huangpu River, and used most of its aircraft to intensely bomb the Communist army in the Chuansha area over Pudong District. The battle results achieved by the Air Force throughout the day on the 17th are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Gaining air supremacy in the Yuepu, Yangxing, and Liuhang areas throughout the day, killing or wounding approximately 2,000 Communist soldiers.</p>
<p>(2) Attacking residences north of Chuansha, killing 300 out of over a thousand Communist soldiers; destroying three Communist jeeps at Bailong Harbor; strafing Communist soldiers on the beach in the area, killing or wounding over 300; supporting our army at the Xinlu Railway Station in repelling two Communist army attacks.</p>
<p>(3) On the Nanxiang to Liuhang highway, a Communist army artillery position was discovered and two of its cannons were destroyed.</p>
<p>(4) Six supply trucks were destroyed in Xinxiao, Pinghu.</p>
<p>(5) In the above battles, due to the intense low-altitude bombing, the Communist army's anti-aircraft fire was fierce, resulting in five of our aircraft being hit in the fuselage. However, all pilots safely returned with their aircraft.</p>

The Communist Party does not respect international refugee agencies or any other international organizations. The Nationalist government does not oppose religion.</p>

<h3>Various Import and Export Firms Request Reduction of Dock Handling Fees</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Various import and export firms in this city believe that the dock handling fee rates for shipping goods were recently set by the Dock Industry Association, calculated at 2 million times the base amount, which is too high and unbearable. They have requested the Import and Export Industry Association to forward their request to the relevant authorities to order a reduction in order to lighten the burden on businesses. The industry association has prepared a document and sent it to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Public Utilities Bureau, and the Dock Industry Association, requesting a reasonable revision and reduction. The original text is as follows: We have investigated that the dock handling fee rates for shipping goods in this city were originally adjusted at any time by the Up and Down Fee Rate Review Committee established by the Public Utilities Bureau based on the price increase. However, recently, the Shanghai Dock Business Association arbitrarily set the rates, calculated at 2 million times the base amount, which exceeds the cost of living index by as much as five and a half times, which is truly an unbearable burden for merchants. Our association has repeatedly received complaints from various members, requesting that we forward their request to the relevant authorities for effective prevention, etc. Upon investigation, various prices have been stable recently, but the pricing of handling fees is particularly high, which seems unreasonable. Moreover, at a time when the situation is tense and the government has issued an order to evacuate goods, shipping is frequent. If the handling fee rate is arbitrarily increased, it will not only increase the burden on merchants, but also be tantamount to obstructing the evacuation of materials. Therefore, we specially request your review and order the Dock Business Association to quickly and reasonably reduce the dock handling fee rate in order to lighten the burden on businesses and facilitate evacuation. We would be extremely grateful.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Importance of Wartime Epidemic Prevention</h3>
<p>This week is Shanghai's Public Health Week, initiated and hosted by the Health Bureau. Its main purposes are twofold: one is general hygiene, and the other is cleanliness. In this tense situation where the sound of artillery fire is deafening day and night, the health authorities are still calmly promoting public health. Its significance is great, and its value should be re-evaluated. During wartime, immigrants are frequent, the population is crowded in a few safe areas, citizens face economic difficulties, nutrition is insufficient, and medical care is inadequate. In addition, it is early summer, the climate is suddenly cold and hot, the humidity is high and the rainfall is abundant. These are all good opportunities for the breeding and spread of germs. Before the disease demons eagerly try to attack, giving them a head start with hygiene is a most economical and effective wise measure to prevent epidemics. Public health is a war, and all of our citizens must participate in this war to prevent epidemics and diseases.</p>
<p>The meaning of public health, as pointed out by hygienist Winslow, has two major focuses: one is to improve health, and the other is to prolong life. And its key is to control infectious diseases. There are two major problems in controlling infectious diseases: one is protecting the individual, and the other is protecting society. Society is the total accumulation of individuals, a complex mixture influenced by the masses, politics, and economics. It can easily spread epidemics, and it can also prevent epidemics. Therefore, policies to control individual diseases must be in line with the needs of the entire society. Public health focuses on society, but it does not neglect the individual. However, there is a distinction here: protecting the group is more important than protecting the individual. Sometimes, in order to protect the public, it is necessary to painfully sacrifice a few individuals.</p>
<p>History tells us that it takes three stages to achieve scientific control of infectious diseases. The first stage belongs to the religious stage; the second is the natural world stage, followed by the microbial stage. Mankind's concept of the source of disease and its transmission attitude initially thought that "Er Shu" and other ghosts and gods were at work, and later thought that the sun, moon, stars, climate, and environment were creating evil. By the end of the nineteenth century, the belief that epidemics were transmitted from person to person or from animals to humans began to sprout. The Old Testament Moses's public health regulations recognized that disease transmission was related to contact between people and people and between people and animals. Israelis prohibited children from eating pork or shellfish, taught people to properly handle feces, and not to associate with lepers. It was not until 1676 that the Dutchman Leeuwenhoek pointed out the existence of microorganisms and implied that this was the source of epidemics. In the mid-nineteenth century, Pasteur proved that epidemics were indeed caused by microorganisms, and epidemic prevention was greatly expanded. Today, many Chinese people are still stuck in our grandfather's century, still clueless about epidemics and mostly confined to superstition. This is the fatal wound of promoting public health. We must use more effort to enlighten and guide them.</p>
<p>Because medicine is developed, European and American countries do not hesitate to spend money on public health. They all believe that investing in public health is the most profitable investment. Therefore, infectious diseases have been reduced on the curve, and even have no place. Typhoid fever, cholera, diphtheria, dysentery, scarlet fever, and trachoma, which are prevalent in our country, have long been unique to them. To study these diseases, one cannot find a lot of materials without coming to the East. Mortality rates in Western Europe in 1946 and 1947 were lower than before the war. France's post-war mortality rate was the lowest in history. The situation in England, Wales, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland is all better than before. Only Germany does not work.</p>
<p>The United States called last year the Year of Health, and this year is even more advanced. Their average life expectancy is nearly sixty-seven years old, and the mortality rate has fallen by 40% in recent years. In 1900, the mortality rate was 17.2 per thousand people. In 1940, it dropped to 10.7. In 1947, it was reduced to 10.1. Below is a comparative statistic of various diseases in 1900 and 1947: (1) Tuberculosis killed 200 people per 100,000, now 37.2, from the first to the seventh leading cause of death. (2) Pneumonia decreased from 180.5 to 46.1, from the second to the sixth leading cause of death. (3) Dysentery originally had 133.1, now it is 14, possibly retreating from the third to the fifteenth leading cause of death. (4) Heart disease originally ranked fourth, now it ranks first, increasing from 132.1 to 306.6. (5) Nephritis was originally 89, ranking sixth in death, now it is reduced to 58; but it has risen to fifth place. (6) Cerebral hemorrhage used to be ranked eighth, now it is as high as third place, at 90.5. (7) The tenth place is cancer, killing 65 people per thousand people, now it has jumped to second place, killing 130 people. Other deadly infectious diseases are insignificant in the United States. Only physiological diseases are worrying. This year, the American Medical Association reported in March and April that they are implementing a disease insurance system, with 52,000,000 people participating. At the same time, the "Federal Security Organization" has hired 40,000 administrative staff to engage in health, education, and welfare. According to experts, they will add at least 400,000 to 500,000 personnel to handle the national health program, with annual expenses ranging from 10,000,000,000 to 18,000,000,000 US dollars.</p>
<p>It is really sad and shameful that we still have to focus on smallpox, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis, diphtheria, and dysentery today to think and expend energy. It is still not possible to smoothly carry out vaccinations for the people, and we have to avoid them and make falsehoods. How can such a society be called civilized! In peacetime, the incidence of tuberculosis is more than 300 patients per 100,000 people, and about four people will die every minute. At least 15 million people in the country suffer from tuberculosis. Malaria, which is malaria, is prevalent throughout the year, and patients account for 10% to 50% of the population. Tragedy shrouded the great era. Sexually transmitted diseases are also terribly digging our graves, and almost 10% or more are infected, especially in Shanghai. In addition, trench fever and tetanus during wartime also have an alarming infection rate, and special plans should be made in advance at this time. Summer has arrived, and cleanliness can no longer be tolerated or ignored. Summer plagues are mostly derived from dirt. Poor societies should still be able to achieve cleanliness, right?</p>
<h3>ECA Reports on Achievements in China</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 16th] In the last quarter of 1948, although the activities of the US Economic Cooperation Administration in China were limited due to the Chinese Civil War, it was still able to complete a considerable degree of practical work, which benefited the Chinese people greatly.</p>
<p>The ECA enabled the food rationing program in five major coastal cities in China to continue, thereby preventing economic collapse and general chaos. It provided strong support for China's main urban industry—the textile industry—thus guaranteeing the jobs and urgent needs of countless workers. The ECA provided essential oil products and coal to maintain the work of the transportation industry, power plants, and various industries. The ECA facilitated the post-distribution of previously US-supplied medical supplies and insecticides. Finally, the ECA used jointly managed counterpart funds to assist many valuable institutions and programs in China, and was able to plan work despite inflation and civil war.</p>
<p>These facts are revealed in the working report of the last quarter of 1948 published by the ECA, which has been forwarded to the US Congress by President Truman. The report also reviews the military and economic setbacks suffered by the Chinese government during this period, and explains that due to these circumstances, the ECA "was unable to take on the widespread problems of stabilizing finance and revitalizing the economy with limited aid to China funds."</p>
<p>The report notes that larger procurement activities in the fourth quarter focused on various materials such as rice, wheat, flour, petroleum, and cotton, but the procurement of major industrial equipment was temporarily suspended due to the unstable military situation.</p>
<p>The report said that wheat and flour were supplied to Qingdao, Beiping, and Tianjin for rationing, while rice was destined for Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Shantou. Most of the oil was stocked by private oil companies in Shanghai and distributed through the equipment of these companies throughout China. In addition, approximately 225,000 barrels of crude oil per month were shipped from the Persian Gulf to Taiwan for refining and then distributed to mainland China.</p>
<p>Most of the cotton was shipped to Shanghai, and smaller portions were shipped to Tianjin, Qingdao, and Wuxi. The cotton, after being spun, was supplied for export and domestic consumption, and sometimes used to exchange for domestically produced food.</p>
<p>During the quarter, the Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee held its first meeting and drafted various plans to increase the production of scarce agricultural products in the country, established an executive center to carry out land reform and promote public health, rural social education, and local administration, and conducted large-scale adult education.</p>
<p>During this quarter, a general plan was drawn up for the use of counterpart funds. It was agreed at the time that withdrawals from the special account would only be possible when there was an urgent need or a demonstrable contractionary effect. The report pointed out that as of December 30, the total amount of counterpart funds was 157,289,000 US dollars in gold yuan, and the amount already spent was approximately 5,839,000 US dollars, of which the ECA's administrative expenses in China accounted for approximately 1,342,000 US dollars, the expenses of the US Aid Operations Committee were 2,498,000 US dollars, the expenses of special projects were 1,803,000 US dollars, most of which was used for river works. Health care and welfare work accounted for US$53,000 in engineering service fees. The report also stated: "Due to the fact that the plan adopted by the ECA mainly involves equipment, a large amount of counterpart funds is required."</p>
<p>During this quarter, the agency began to discuss with Chinese merchants to allow their products to be exported to the United States for storage. Preliminary consultations were underway at the end of the year. However, the report stated that the transaction problem was further complicated because the completion of the transaction depended on the exchange of commodities and silver dollars, and the depreciated local currency could not be used. The Eightieth Congress has appropriated 275 million yuan as the amount to implement the ECA aid to China program. As of December 31, 195 million yuan has been spent. The subsequent ECA appropriation has brought the total amount of aid to date to 221,918,000 yuan. The Che Hui recently extended the period of the ECA Aid to China Act, extending the original deadline of April 3 this year to February 15, 1950. The unused balance of the original appropriation will be used as the fund for this period.</p>

<h3>UN Maintains Resolution on Diplomatic Restrictions on Franco's Spain; Issue of Italian Colonies Still Awaiting Vote; Current UN General Assembly to Announce End Today or Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 17th] The current United Nations General Assembly will close today or tomorrow. One major political issue remains unresolved on the agenda, namely the disposition of the former Italian colonies, which has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 16th] The United Nations General Assembly tonight upheld its three-year ban on Franco's Spain, but at the same time quashed the Soviet bloc's movement to impose economic sanctions on the Madrid government. The voting on the two cases was as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the proposal by the Latin American countries to allow United Nations member states to re-appoint ambassadors and ministers to Madrid, the vote was 26 to 15, with 16 abstentions and 2 absences. Because this proposal did not receive a two-thirds majority, it failed to pass. (2) Poland's proposal to ban United Nations member states from transporting munitions to Spain and restricting trade with Spain was rejected by 40 votes to 6, with 7 abstentions. Only the Soviet bloc voted in favor. The United States and the United Kingdom abstained from voting on the first proposal and voted against the second proposal. Before the vote, Polish representative Katz-Suchy denied British representative McNeil's claim that Franco ordered 500 warplanes, propellers, and engines from Poland last year, and said that Poland has no commercial relations with Spain. After the Spanish issue was resolved, the General Assembly adjourned until late at night, when it will discuss the issue of refugees and displaced persons.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 17th] The United Nations General Assembly began debating another Polish proposal this morning, advocating that all countries should accelerate the withdrawal of stateless refugees. Representatives from Poland, Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Soviet Union accused the Western German occupation authorities of obstructing the withdrawal of refugees who wanted to return to their home countries and allowing international refugee agencies to send these refugees to other countries as "slaves." Therefore, they demanded the adoption of all methods to promote the work of withdrawing refugees and to control refugees sent to other countries. As a result, this proposal was rejected by 31 votes to 6, with 14 abstentions.</p>
<h3>Gromyko Arrives in Paris; Rumor that Cominform is Meeting in Moscow; Eastern European Countries All Send Representatives to Participate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko and his eleven Soviet delegation members arrived here this afternoon from New York by plane. Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov welcomed them at the airport. After getting off the plane, Gromyko refused to make any statement to reporters, only saying that he would leave here for Moscow tomorrow or the day after.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 16th] Well-informed sources here claimed today that a secret meeting of the Cominform has been convened in Moscow, and representatives from all countries of the "Eastern European Bloc" are attending. The same source said that this is the reason why some leaders of the German Socialist Unity Party are currently not in Berlin. They believe that the convening of this meeting is intended to re-discuss the policies taken by the international communist party since the end of the war before the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Bevin Scheduled to Go to France on Friday</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] British Military Governor of Germany Robertson came here from Germany today to have contact with the Foreign Office. He is scheduled to go to Paris on Wednesday to join other British representatives in preparing for the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. A spokesperson for the external office also said that Bevin will leave England for Paris on Friday with Deputy Foreign Secretary Henderson.</p>
<h3>Wallace's Speech: Establishing World Peace, Proposing Six Goals</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 17th] Progressive Party leader Henry Wallace stated in a speech at Madison Square Garden here last night that the hope for peace has stirred the heartstrings of all people. The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris should transform this hope into a concrete agreement. Wallace continued by stating that the goals of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference should be: (1) resolving the German problem, ensuring that Germany's war potential does not re-emerge; (2) reducing armaments, especially all major destructive weapons; (3) stopping the export of arms from one country to another; (4) restoring world trade without any restrictions; (5) allowing people from all over the world to move freely from one country to another; and (6) freely exchanging scientific knowledge between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>A Dictatorial Regime Brewing in Iran</h3>
<p>Gendarmerie Still Under Army Command</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] The "New York Times" correspondent in Tehran learned from reliable sources that U.S. officials in Tehran were surprised to learn of the Shah's preparation to return command of the gendarmerie to the Ministry of the Army. This is a clear step towards dictatorship, as it would concentrate military power in the hands of soldiers who favor establishing a dictatorial government. It is reported that since 1942, the United States has been assisting Iran in reorganizing its gendarmerie. After strenuous efforts by the U.S. advisory group, the gendarmerie was handed over to the Ministry of the Interior to become a purely police force, no longer directly under the command of the Ministry of the Army. The Iranian army, like the armies of South America, plays a major role in politics. The current plan of the Shah is to first launch a coup, become Minister of the Army, then gradually become Prime Minister, and eventually proclaim himself King. It is recently rumored that the current Chief of Staff, Razmara, advocates establishing a dictatorship in Iran, with the current Shah Reza as King, and Razmara himself as the Shah's right-hand man, allowing him to wield absolute power. If the transfer of the gendarmerie to the command of the Ministry of the Army is confirmed, it will be the greatest threat to the development of democracy in Iran.</p>
<h3>Tripoli Residents Oppose Italian Trusteeship, Demonstrations Widen</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 17th] News reaching Cairo tonight states that the demonstrations which began in Tripoli last week have gained significant momentum. Demonstrators are shouting slogans against Italy and demanding the unification of Libya under the rule of Sayyid Idris al-Senussi, the nominal ruler of Cyrenaica, the neighboring region. It is reported that the political parties in Tripoli have traditionally been divided, with most opposing Sayyid Idris's rule. However, the Bevin-Sforza Plan, which advocates placing Tripoli under Italian trusteeship after 1951, has angered all parties, causing them to set aside their differences. They have sent a telegram to Benghazi requesting Sayyid Idris to declare himself King of Libya. The flags of Sayyid Idris have been raised on mosques in Tripoli today. It is reported that Libya includes Tripoli and Cyrenaica.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Benghazi, 17th] The wave of demonstrations against the Bevin-Sforza Plan and demanding complete independence in Tripoli has now spread to Cyrenaica.

<h3>US Republican Senator Advocates Military Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Republican Senator Knowland revealed today that a group of Republican senators will attempt to promote a $200 million military aid plan for China. It is claimed that "this matter will be raised in the Senate during the discussion of the government's $1.45 billion overall military aid plan. I believe we can obtain enough votes to include the military aid plan for China in the overall foreign aid plan." It is reported that the government is requesting $1.13 billion to assist countries in the Atlantic Treaty organization to rearm, and another $320 million to assist Greece and Turkey. However, due to the upcoming Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris, government leaders are not accelerating the promotion of this plan. Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Democratic leader Lucas, agree that there is no urgent need for swift action at this time. Furthermore, the Foreign Relations Committee's discussion of the North Atlantic Treaty is nearing its end and is expected to conclude and be approved on the 18th.</p>
<h3>South Korea Feels Threatened by Aggression, Calls for U.S. Military Aid, Hopes to Conclude Pacific Pact</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Dr. Chough Pyong-ok, the special representative of South Korean President Syngman Rhee, told the press today that South Korea is likely to be subjected to Soviet aggression "at any time" and requested the United States to provide a military guarantee to support South Korea's territorial integrity. Dr. Chough confirmed that the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists have formed a "de facto alliance" with the North Korean Communist government, and stated that South Korea hopes to obtain a definite guarantee of military support from the United States in the event of foreign aggression or domestic aggression controlled by foreign powers.</p>
<p>Dr. Chough stated that South Korea needs military equipment to supply a standing army of 100,000 men and a police force and reserve army of 100,000 men. Up to now, "the United States has only supplied equipment for approximately 38,000 people in Korea. Obviously, we need more military aid."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 16th] South Korean President Syngman Rhee issued a statement today, reiterating his appeal to the United States, stating that he proposes one of the following three measures to address the serious threat posed by communist aggression to South Korea and Asia: (1) concluding a Pacific Treaty, similar to the Atlantic Treaty; (2) forming a separate agreement between the United States and South Korea, implementing joint defense against any country; (3) issuing a public declaration guaranteeing the defense, unification, democracy, and independence of Korea, consistent with President Truman's anti-communist policy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 16th] Canadian Foreign Ministry officials have not yet commented on the report from Canberra that "a Pacific Security Pact plan is in progress."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] An editorial in the English-language "Japan Times" on the 17th called for the establishment of a non-communist Pacific alliance to form an all-Asian economic resistance front to cope with the rapidly developing communism in its new base in China.</p>
<h3>Indian Constituent Assembly Approves Declaration of Republic within Commonwealth, US Lifts Arms Embargo to India</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 17th] The Indian Constituent Assembly today, by an overwhelming majority, resolved that India will continue to participate in the British Commonwealth. Prime Minister Nehru told the Constituent Assembly that India's continued connection with the Commonwealth would enable India to obtain economic assistance and would also help maintain domestic order. He also stated that the declaration of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London did not bind India, and that India could leave the Commonwealth at any time by a resolution of the Constituent Assembly.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Karachi, 16th] Authoritative sources here stated that the United States has lifted the order to suspend the shipment of arms to India and Pakistan. It is reported that this ban was implemented after the partition of India and Pakistan and was suspended in February. The source also said that Pakistan has ordered some arms from the United States.</p>
<h3>Eisler Arrested in UK, US Requests Extradition</h3>
<p>Britain Rejects Polish Protest</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] A U.S. State Department spokesman today confirmed that the Department of Justice has requested the British government to extradite Gerhart Eisler, a U.S. communist who fled to Britain and was arrested. The request was telegraphed to the U.S. Ambassador in London on the 13th of this month for transmission to the British government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Polish Ambassador to Britain, Michalowski, lodged a verbal protest today regarding the arrest of German communist Gerhart Eisler by British police on a Polish mail ship. He stated that the British authorities boarded the ship and arrested Eisler without the permission of the Polish consul or the ship's owner, which was a violation of international law. A British Foreign Office spokesman stated tonight that the arrest of Eisler did not violate international law.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] British Home Secretary Ede declared in the House of Commons today that Eisler is guilty of forging documents and should be extradited under the Anglo-American extradition treaty. Eisler had violated his bail terms and fled in secret. The U.S. Embassy had requested the Southampton magistrate to issue a warrant for his arrest. Subsequently, police officers boarded the Polish ship Batory and informed the captain that the arrest would be delayed if the captain agreed to keep the ship in place until the afternoon to allow further consideration of the matter. When the captain refused, the police officers immediately carried out the arrest. At this point, Communist Party Member Gallacher stood up and shouted loudly, and the Speaker ordered him to maintain order. Ede then answered questions from left-wing Members of Parliament Zilliacus and Mills, stating that the case is currently being heard by a local official, who will determine the legal points of the U.S. government's extradition request. If the Polish government applied for the arrest of a person on an American ship, it would be handled in the same manner. Gallacher then attempted to launch a full debate on the case, but the Speaker refused, stating that the most important point of this case is that it should be heard by the court, and the House of Commons cannot interfere.</p>
<h3>Chinese Communist Party Representatives Attending the Paris Peace Conference Discuss the CCP's Policy Line: Adhering to the Soviet Union, No Tito Allowed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 17th] Chinese Communist Party leaders want the CCP to implement orthodox communist policies. They are well aware that Western countries hope the CCP can become the Tito of the East, so they are doing their best to prevent the CCP from developing such a trend. This is at least the opinion of the CCP delegation attending the Paris World Peace Congress. The delegation is under strict security police protection here, and it is virtually impossible for Western reporters to meet with them. Several Western reporters attempted to meet with the Chinese representatives, but they were stopped by accompanying detectives after only a few words.</p>
<p>However, judging from the statements made by Qian Zongrui (transliteration), one of the representatives, to Czech communist reporters, and the information obtained from other sources, it appears that the CCP also intends to implement the policies determined by the Cominform for the people's democracies. Diplomatic observers believe that the Chinese delegation attending the Peace Congress is an authoritative delegation that fully represents the CCP, so their statements regarding the CCP's policy decisions are indeed worthy of attention. Qian Zongrui, an economics professor at Peking University, solemnly declared to Czech reporters, "There is no, will not be, and cannot be any Tito in China. The victory of the Chinese people is the result of an international policy." Those familiar with communist jargon immediately understand that Qian's intention is to deny any trend of the CCP turning into national communists. Qian also emphasized that "the Chinese people have been greatly encouraged by the Soviet Union and the rights of the people's democracies." Observers point out that this is an acknowledgment of the Soviet Union and the Red Army having strength beyond that of other countries, which is precisely what Marshal Tito despises. Qian also said, "Politically, the CCP will learn lessons from the Soviet experience." This statement is also entirely in line with the attitude of orthodox communists in Europe. Qian also said, "The new China will be a people's democracy leaning towards socialism," which is the same attitude as the Czech Communist Party. For the past year, the Czech Communist Party has consistently used the same formula to describe its own position. What the Czech Communist Party advocates is that under the leadership of the Communist Party, and based on the speeches of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, and the lessons learned from the Moscow Communist Party experience, the first step is to overthrow the opposing forces, and then establish a dictatorship and organize the people's democracy. According to the theory, people's democracy is only the first stage of promoting communism, and socialism is its second stage. Currently, only the Soviet Union has reached the second stage, and communism is the third and final stage. Under this stage, the state theoretically tends to disappear, the development of a classless society is completed, and the goal of universal human equality is achieved. In the case of China, it is currently in the earliest stage, because its "people's democratic" government is still being formed. One of the initial tasks of any people's democratic government is to industrialize the country. Lenin and Stalin both believed that the proletariat in the industrial sector is the most trustworthy, and although farmers can also participate, land ownership is ultimately a major risk factor that can increase or decrease capitalism. Therefore, the Cominform's circular last year attached great importance to this point. In its condemnation of Tito, it pointed out that he had made various mistakes in handling rural issues. In the case of the CCP, it seems to have learned a lot from this. Qian stated, "The CCP's first priority is to transform the agricultural country of China into an industrial country. In this regard, we should learn a lot from the lessons the Soviet Union has obtained in the past." According to reports, the Soviet Union's first step was to nationalize all land, and then deal with this land, resulting in a great famine and mass exodus. Today, the people's democracies, with the Soviet Union as a cautionary tale, are gradually reforming the countryside, and will nationalize the land when the time is ripe.</p>

<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Passes Bill to Expand Police Force</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The Japanese House of Representatives passed a bill to expand the police force tonight, "due to recent changes in the international situation, the police need to ensure social stability and improve people's lives." The main points of the bill are to improve the police organization, readjust the relationship between the national rural police and the local government police, and improve police benefits, but it does not mention expanding police weapons and equipment.</p>
<h3>Emperor Hirohito Tours Southern Japan, Lasting Approximately Four Weeks</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 17th] Emperor Hirohito left here at nine o'clock this morning with twenty attendants on a special train to Kyushu, for a twenty-seven-day tour. He will inspect the island's cultural industries and social conditions, and visit various cities, including Nagoya, which was bombed by the atomic bomb. Observers here say that since the establishment of Japan's new constitution, Hirohito has often traveled outside and contacted the people in an attempt to restore his reputation. However, since December 1947, he had temporarily suspended activities while awaiting the verdicts of war criminals such as Tojo. Now that this matter has passed, he is free to travel again. It is reported that Kyushu was the center of activity for extreme Japanese patriots before the war, and it is now a concentration point for both far-right and far-left elements. Japanese newspapers say that when Hirohito travels, he will personally pay the travel expenses for himself and his attendants, reversing the previous practice of having local governments bear the expenses.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Results of East German Elections for Parliament Announced Yesterday: More Votes Against Than For, Unexpected</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 17th] The East German elections for the People's Chamber have ended today, and the preliminary results have greatly disappointed the Communist Party. According to the East Berlin Election General Committee, in the initial count of 7,000 votes, 2,820 voted in favor of the "People's Chamber," while as many as 3,809 voted against it, with approximately 250 invalid votes.</p>
<p>Some ballots were inscribed with the words "We do not approve of the police state, we oppose communism." The Election Committee has been ordered to temporarily stop counting votes pending review. The final results of the election will be announced by the People's Committee controlled by the Communist Party. At the same time, the Soviet military newspaper accused the German separatist Catholic Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party of being duplicitous, pretending to be loyal to the People's Congress, while secretly instigating the people to oppose it, and that the voters who cast negative votes must have been tricked by them.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 17th] Communist officials completed the counting of votes for the "People's Congress" this morning, but refused to announce any results, which seems to confirm reports that the election results show that more voters opposed than supported the list of candidates put forward by the Communist Party. Newspapers in West Berlin reported that more than half of the voters rejected the candidates designated by the Communist Party. Officials subsequently announced that the election results will be released on the 18th.</p>

<h3>French Troops to Launch Major Offensive in Northern Vietnam</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, 16th] Well-informed sources say that the French army may take action on the Vietnamese-Chinese border to deal with the Viet Minh army. This decision may be made after French Army Chief of Staff General Revers arrives in Saigon from France. In this new plan, the pacification work in southern Vietnam will be undertaken by the Vietnamese army. Nguyen Van Quang, of the Viet Minh Central Provisional Government, will soon meet with Bao Dai to discuss the possibility of large-scale use of the Vietnamese army in the south to deal with guerrillas. According to a French military communiqué today, French troops occupied Dongguang City, 93 miles northwest of Hanoi, on the 12th, destroying several important military installations of the rebels along the way before occupying the area. The communiqué also stated that French troops have begun sweeping operations in the Mengxian River Basin.</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliamentarians Urge Soviet Union to Release Japanese POWs Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] Several members of the Japanese House of Representatives representing the major parties collectively visited the Soviet diplomatic mission here yesterday to request the early release of Japanese prisoners of war still detained in the Soviet region. Since Soviet mission chief Derekianko was absent, the Japanese parliamentary representatives were unable to obtain answers to the questions of when the release would begin this year and why it was being delayed. However, Soviet political advisor Lozanov promised to convey this intention to Derekianko and told the representatives to come back for a reply before May 20.</p>
<h3>Industrial Production in Western European Recipient Countries Gradually Recovering to Pre-War Levels: US Economic Cooperation Administration Releases Performance Report</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] President Truman submitted to Congress today the 1948 annual winter report of the Economic Cooperation Administration, stating that the economic situation of the countries in Europe receiving aid under the Marshall Plan has made satisfactory progress, and it is expected that the dollar shortage situation in these countries can be improved by 30% by June or July of this year. Truman also warned that if European countries wish to be independent and self-sufficient by the end of the Marshall Plan in 1952, they must complete large-scale economic development and reforms. Truman stated that the joint efforts of European countries receiving US aid to restore economic health have completed the first phase, and have generally reached pre-war production levels. However, this is not enough, and these countries must try their best to exceed pre-war levels before they can succeed. Judging from the work plan of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation for July 1948 to June 1949, its performance at the end of December last year can be considered satisfactory. There is confidence that the production and trade targets for the 1948-1949 fiscal year have been achieved. The shortage of gold and US dollars under the capital and current accounts is 5.5 billion yuan, compared to 7.8 billion yuan in the previous fiscal year, a decrease of 30%. Only a few countries are lagging slightly behind in the pace of recovery. However, the second phase has just begun, with the goal of achieving the highest level of production necessary for economic independence. Before the end of this phase, Western European production must exceed pre-war levels. The President's report also stated that in 1947, Western European countries could only afford less than 40% of imports with their financial resources, and it is now expected that they can afford half. If they want to balance exports and imports, they must step up their efforts, especially focusing on innovating industries, improving exports to adapt to the market, developing overseas territories, reducing trade barriers, and attracting tourists with European landmarks. The fundamental reforms of the Western European economy can only be done gradually, and US aid is an essential part of its recovery.</p>

Soon after, Railways advanced, Zhang Jie received Gao Baozheng's pass and flicked the ball near the goal.

Qingbai's five forwards advanced together, Luo Shoufu broke through, and Railways' Gao Baozheng missed the ball, Liu Longxing overtook Liao Xiong and scored into the empty net, making it 3-2.

In the last three minutes, Railways' Lu Qingxiang and Zhang Jie launched a two-pronged attack, but Meng Yiliang intercepted them. Soon, the regular time was up, and the result was a 3-3 draw.</p>

<h3>Mayor Issues Message to Citizens: Food and Coal Supplies Assured; Should Help the Military Defend Greater Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Chen received reporters at the City Hall conference room yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM and issued a written statement, "Message to the Citizens of Shanghai," as follows: "I, Liang, having been entrusted with this mission at a time when Shanghai is facing war, feel deeply apprehensive and terrified. However, mindful of Shanghai as the nation's economic center, built up over a century with achievements not easily attained, I bear the inescapable responsibility to preserve and maintain it. Therefore, with a sense of profound unease and burdened by overwhelming pressure, I respectfully present my sincere thoughts to all fellow citizens of the city, earnestly seeking your cooperation so that we may navigate these turbulent waters together. First, livelihood is paramount, food is first: Shanghai has a population of six million, and maintaining their daily lives is already quite difficult, let alone in wartime. Therefore, the first task of the municipal government today is how to maintain the lives of citizens and prevent them from feeling the heavy pressure of war too much. In this regard, I dare to solemnly announce to all fellow citizens of the city that the municipal government, in conjunction with relevant agencies, has planned for a certain amount of food and coal supplies, which will definitely not be lacking. The supply of affordable rations to poor citizens should be increased to maintain their minimum needs. Second, public order is paramount, stability is first: Although Shanghai is facing war, the military forces defending Shanghai will certainly strike the attackers, and Shanghai will still be Shanghai of the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, I especially request all fellow citizens in the city to remain steadfast in their professional positions during this battle to defend Greater Shanghai, and actively participate in various self-defense organizations to enhance the city's public security forces, curb the activities of spies, and quell the instigation of riots by thugs, in order to ensure the stability of Shanghai and prevent it from being affected by the war. Third, support the war effort, unite the military and civilians: The national army operating around Shanghai is strong, loyal, and brave, and will certainly win on the battlefield. Under the premise that everything is for Shanghai and everything is for the war, the citizens of Shanghai must do everything possible to help the army and be willing to defend Greater Shanghai for the people. Fourth, maintain production, labor and capital cooperate: Shanghai is an industrial city, and with the start of victory, there were signs of recovery, but due to frequent wars everywhere and the shrinking domestic market, the situation has become increasingly depressed. Now that we are facing war, closing down is not an option, and maintaining production is impossible. It is not difficult to imagine the plight of industrialists and businessmen. At this time, capitalists should consider the livelihoods of workers, and workers should also understand the difficulties of capitalists, helping each other through difficulties and sharing hardships together. As for the municipal government, it will do everything possible to coordinate and assist in order to overcome the current difficulties and preserve the foundation for future recovery. Fifth, reform politics, eliminate corruption: Reforming politics depends on diligent action. Eliminating corruption, weeding out incompetence, saving financial and material resources, and improving administrative efficiency are my firm resolutions. However, from top to bottom, it is difficult to adapt to reality. I sincerely hope that my colleagues in the municipal government and all fellow citizens will report to the municipal government what they see, and I will sincerely accept it. If there are those in the municipal government who are corrupt, pervert the law, commit crimes, or violate the law, I hope that you will report them at any time in order to revitalize the decline and establish righteousness. Sixth, stabilize the economy, eliminate speculation: Shanghai is known as a paradise for adventurers, coming and going in droves. The bustling Bund is almost entirely shrouded in an atmosphere of speculation. In normal times, this is enough to disrupt the market and stir up people's hearts, making it impossible for economic life to seek normalcy. In wartime, it only adds fuel to the fire and provides opportunities for the enemy. Therefore, my response to Shanghai's economy today is to seek stability through control. All commercial speculation will be eliminated with the greatest effort, so that industrialists and businessmen can obtain reasonable survival in a normal market environment. Seventh, one world, cooperation between China and foreign countries: Shanghai is an international city, and citizens, regardless of their nationality, share a common destiny. Although we are facing war today, the municipal government will, in accordance with international conventions, provide strict protection for the lives and property of foreigners. However, it is also hoped that foreign communities will, in the spirit of one world, cooperate sincerely to overcome the current crisis. Eighth, expert politics, build Shanghai: Shanghai is eternal. Although we are facing war today, we will never put Shanghai's construction projects behind us because of the war. The blueprint for the construction of Shanghai is new and concrete in our minds. War and construction can complement each other. Therefore, for the current municipal facilities, while dealing with the war situation and maintaining the status quo, the fundamental plan is still how to draw the blueprint for the construction of Shanghai. Appoint experts, work together, and given time, I believe that Shanghai will surely become a paradise for the people. The above are all humble opinions, but governance lies not in many words, but in how to strive for action. I am a servant of the six million people of Shanghai, but politics is ultimately the matter of the people. Therefore, what the six million fellow citizens of Shanghai should strive for today is how to supervise and promote the municipal government to be pragmatic, from the bottom up, unite sincerely, so that the new force of democratic progress can grow rapidly, and with firm and unwavering action, jointly and steadily overcome the current war situation. We have faith, and we will question the future."</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Remittances Temporarily Not Listed: Decision by the Police Headquarters Political Committee</h3>
<p>The matter of listing silver dollar exchange rates, which had been brewing for several days, has been decided by the Police Headquarters Political Committee to be temporarily suspended in order to avoid stimulating price increases. The Central Bank of China complied with the order yesterday and did not post the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Central Bank of China's payment of overnight deposit balances for various banks and firms yesterday remained at 70% in cash and 30% in banker's drafts, entrusted to the clearing house for payment.</p>
<p>After the Central Bank complied with the order from the Garrison Headquarters Political Committee to temporarily suspend the listing of remittances, remittances from overseas Chinese will still be converted at the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, making it unnecessary to list them. These certificates can be freely bought and sold in Shanghai and Guangzhou in South China, so there should be no inconvenience. It is estimated that around two million US dollars worth of foreign exchange certificates are currently circulating in the Shanghai market.</p>
<p>The market for foreign exchange transfer certificates saw a sudden rebound yesterday, due to the low US dollar exchange rate. It opened at 1.6 million, with transactions as low as 1.5 million. It then rallied due to rising gold and currency prices, reaching over 2 million, and finally settling at 2.12 million, up 600,000 from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Black Market Soars</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's silver dollar market was in a state of stalemate due to the Central Bank's failure to list rates. Businesses continued to suspend trading.

<h3>Gold Prices Rise Steadily, National Bank Sells Extensively to Suppress Prices to 5 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The gold market yesterday saw extremely enthusiastic sentiment due to positive external factors, with abundant funds and a lack of supply. Trading became increasingly chaotic. The official listed price reached the daily limit of 4.608 billion, with plenty of bids but no offers. The outside market saw even greater gains, opening at 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion and rising steadily, breaking through the 5 billion mark, reaching as high as 5.3 billion and 5.5 billion. The Central Bank then entrusted Dadecheng Gold Shop to sell gold at prices of 5.4 billion and 5.3 billion, but there were no takers due to the high price. The market closed slightly lower at 5.2 billion and 5.4 billion in the afternoon. In the afternoon, the market stabilized as the Central Bank suppressed prices to 5 billion, entrusting Dadecheng with unlimited sales. The gold shop had strong buying interest and sold a total of 149 large bars, ultimately closing at 5.1 billion and 5.3 billion, a significant increase of 1.1 billion from the previous day.</p>
<p>The outside market for US dollars followed suit, with demand exceeding supply. It opened at 8.3 million and 8.8 million, quickly surpassing the 10 million mark, reaching as high as 10.2 million and 10.7 million, before closing at 10 million and 10.5 million in the afternoon.

<h3>No Goods Arriving on the Market, Rice Prices Continue to Rise</h3>

White japonica and thin paddy rice each opened at 58 million at the North Market. White yuan rice sales were slow, opening at only 53 million, with no new arrivals registered on the market.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Prices also rose due to the increase in gold and silver prices, but with more selling than buying, the market remained weak. Jiujiang winter beans were at 32 million, up over 10 million from yesterday. Corn rose by over 3 million. Transactions in mung beans were limited. Pudong mud mung beans were at 37 million, while peanuts and sesame seeds rose uniformly.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Languishing in a weak state. Although prices outside the exchange rose, public sentiment was low, with many sellers. The opening saw some weakness, but the market recovered slightly later, ultimately settling at the previous day's level. Old Che flour opened at 10.4 million and closed at 12 million. Warship flour closed at 10 million. Red Bee flour was weak, while Jiancheng was stable. Wheat bran opened at 8 million.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Followed the rise in gold and silver, opening strong but declining slightly later due to excessive selling. Soybean oil opened at 200 million at the factory, later seeing a rebound to 180 million, up 5 million from the previous day. Rapeseed oil closed at 150 million, also up 5 million. Raw oil approached the 200 million mark. Soybean cake did not open.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth All Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton yarn saw strong market conditions due to strong buying interest from various merchants, with firm public sentiment and continued gains in financial products outside the exchange. 42-count Blue Phoenix traded at 172.5 million, up 37.5 million from the previous day. 40-count and 32-count each rose by 250 million to 280 million, while 21-count Double Horse spot goods were at 107.5 million, up around 200 million. 20-count and below each rose by 150 million to 250 million.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth saw a steady upward trend. The Ningbo merchants continued to actively buy, and the black market price of silver dollars steadily rose, so the market price in gold yuan notes saw an obvious rise. Dragon Head fine cloth and low-end fine cloth were particularly strong due to strong customer sales. Four Gentlemen yuan serge, however, saw narrower demand due to seasonal factors, and fell slightly compared to the previous day. Dragon Head fine cloth and Four Gentlemen yuan serge both opened at 17.6 million, then rose together to a high of 18.4 million due to numerous buyers, before profitable sales near closing.

Three Peaches fine cloth jumped by 1.2 million, ultimately closing at 15.6 million. Private factory prices rose sharply, with high-end shirting opening at 80 million.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Rebounds and Rises</h3>
<p>The tea market remained sluggish due to weak actual sales and hesitant buying interest, with no significant transactions. After a long period of stagnation, the market rebounded sharply yesterday, with prices uniformly breaking through their original positions and moving forward. The reason for this was that the strong performance of gold had not waned, constantly boosting public sentiment. Sellers raised prices to extremes, ultimately resulting in gains of 60-70 million per dan (unit of weight), with fairly firm footing.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The tung oil market continued to rise yesterday, with prices reaching unprecedented highs. This was due to the continuous rise in prices of goods outside the industry, especially the rapid surge in gold prices, which further boosted public sentiment. Sellers continued to raise prices, ultimately leading to excitement, but weak buying interest made it difficult for transactions to turn around.</p>

<h3>Wugang and Chengbu Shrouded in Dark Shadows</h3>
<p>[Changsha News] "The people of Chengbu are in a state of panic, Wugang is startled several times a night." According to a casual conversation with a person who recently came to Changsha from Chengbu, this sentence summarizes the recent situation in Chengbu and Wugang. Chengbu and Wugang are on the edge of southwestern Hunan. When the overall situation changed, wildfires first broke out on the southwestern edge of Hunan. These wildfires are still burning, and now Yin Liyan (a graduate of the Army Academy who once served as the president of the Nanjing Huaxia Daily) and others want to spread these wildfires to the southwest. - Ambitious figures in the border areas are active, but the people are groaning.</p>
<p>Yin Liyan now calls himself "Commander-in-Chief of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Guizhou and Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government." He wears such a large hat, which is a bluff, but it is a bit touching, especially for the general rural ignorant and general anti-faction members, it is not without a little temptation. In Chengbu, near the Sui Ning border, it is said that some people have been contacted. Recently, bandit activity was discovered near Xiyan City (80 miles from Chengbu County and 40 miles from Wugang County). The Xiyan police station sends police everywhere to search and suppress them during the day, but there is no trace. At night, in order to avoid being "touched", they have to drag people and guns to other places to camp. When people are sent to persuade them, they say: "We are all locals, how can we be exploited by Yin Liyan!"</p>
<p>"Mo Xinchun in Wugang has about 800 people and guns, occupying the triangular area of Tangdukoutangtian City and Baicang. Liu Qiong occupies Dengjiapu in the northwest township, and Liu Zhenguo occupies Shanmen. These roles are directly or indirectly related to Yin Liyan. The Wugang police force also clashed with them twice. As a result, Zhang Zhenqing's police team defeated Liu Zhenguo and confiscated several of his guns, but Xie Guangming's police team was eaten up by Liu Qiong and more than 60 guns were taken away. Their leaflets, slogans and notices were once posted in Wugang County, meaning: We will enter the city soon, and we hope the people will not disturb each other.</p>
<p>It is said that Mo Xinchun and Liu Qiong want to develop towards Chengbu and plan to cross the Xin (Ning) Wu (Gang) border via Huangqiaopu and attack Weixi Township in Chengbu to seize the self-defense weapons in Xiyan City: Yin Liyan also ordered a certain Yuan, the "garrison battalion commander" stationed in Huangtutang, to surround Chengbu County via Haikou, Suining. They believe that Chengbu is a place that can be attacked and defended, and the food is quite abundant, and the self-defense weapons make them even more coveted, which is why they have the ambition to get involved. Another saying is that there are local Communists active in Chengbu. The Sixth District Commissioner's Office saw the crisis in Chengbu and specially sent an inspector to deploy defenses. After several meetings, the only result was to transfer the self-defense team originally stationed in the county to Xiyan to defend against Mo Xinchun's intrusion.</p>
<p>Currently, there are still bandits or scattered bandits in Chengbu who are harassing the people, and neighboring counties Suining and Wugang are frequently reporting emergencies. There are more rumors about Suining, and some say that certain self-defense forces in the county have been shaken. Although this is not necessarily all true, it has a great impact on people's hearts. Inside Chengbu, however, there is still open and secret strife, causing chaos.</p>
<p>In addition to this future concern, there is also the legend of corruption. In the streets and alleys, after drinking and over tea, the legend of corruption has become a common topic of conversation. It is said that if you want to be a township head, you have to buy the position with money. The township head near the town temple costs 300 silver dollars, and the remote township also costs one or two hundred. Now Chengbu can't see newspapers and foreign mail, and the common people seem to be stuffed in a dark cave, not knowing what the outside world has become; everyone is guessing: in a month or two, there will probably be a terrible situation coming."</p>
<h3>The Stalemate in Western Yunnan</h3>
<p>— Zheng Chuan</p>
<p>[Kunming Dispatch] Not long ago, the communist bandits in southern Yunnan captured Shiping and besieged Mengzi, their fierce advance cutting off traffic on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. At the same time, communist bandits in eastern Yunnan occupied Lunan and attacked Yiliang, directly threatening the gates of Kunming, causing panic and unrest among the populace.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the authorities had no choice but to concentrate their efforts, and the main force of the 26th Army was deployed to southern Yunnan. The Pacification and Security Regiment, originally stationed in western Yunnan, was also successively transferred back to Kunming, finally alleviating the crisis in southern Yunnan.</p>
<p>The communist bandit troops are all from rural backgrounds, unworldly, and only took to the path of rebellion to make a living. These untrained and unorganized peasants cannot withstand a single blow from the Central Army. For example, Wan Baobang's unit, once enjoying great prestige, suffered repeated defeats, retreating hundreds of miles to the Yunnan-Vietnam border.</p>
<p>However, to avoid the main force and engage in a "hide-and-seek" tactic with the Central Army, the communist bandits, after the situation in southern Yunnan calmed down, caused trouble again in western Yunnan. Not long after the Security Regiment withdrew to Kunming, Menghua County responded with an uprising led by a local landlord and tyrant, Li Shuo-sheng. What is strange is that the authorities were completely unaware beforehand, and were even about to appoint him as the magistrate of Huhua County. The day after receiving the news, Li Shuo-sheng led his private troops and suddenly stormed into the county seat, implementing an armed takeover of the county government. The incumbent magistrate, He Shao-cheng, a former provincial senator and newspaper publisher, never dreamed that disaster would fall from the sky and was "captured alive" by Li Shuo-sheng. It turns out that there had been a rift between He and Li for some time, because He had been ordered to eradicate opium, destroying Li's opium seedlings—his wealth. Li now wants revenge, to settle the opium account, demanding compensation from He Shao-cheng for the losses, pricing each opium seedling at two jiao (half a silver dollar). Li even wanted to kill He, but fortunately some local elders intervened, and He was spared from death, but it is rumored that He's wife was subjected to torture—her hair was burned off.</p>
<p>After occupying Menghua, Li Shuo-sheng even raised the banner of the "Democratic Allied Army," openly antagonizing Lu Han. This terrible wildfire is spreading, and the surrounding counties, already in turmoil, are "learning" from Li Shuo-sheng. Midu, Jingdong, Yun County, Changning, and Mianning—have successively rebelled.</p>
<p>Next, Baoshan, an important town in western Yunnan and a major station on the Burma Road, also saw a rebellion led by the former county magistrate, Yang Heng-zhou, and the dismissed commander of the regiment management area, Zhang Zhen-ying. Kunming had already received intelligence that Baoshan was about to "rebel." On April 11, telecommunications between Kunming and Baoshan were cut off.</p>
<p>The following day, the fall of Baoshan was confirmed, and the rebellion's armed forces stormed the city walls late at night, setting fire to the county government. The county magistrate's whereabouts are unknown. The county bank was looted, and the manager and many other elders were shot. A major fire engulfed the entire city, and order collapsed. Criminals took the opportunity to rob, and the innocent civilians suffered a great disaster.</p>
<p>The fall of Baoshan, when the bad news arrived, shook not only the entire western Yunnan but also Kunming, because Baoshan is one of the four major counties in the province, with a large county seat, developed commerce, and is a thoroughfare on the Yunnan-Burma Road.</p>
<p>After occupying Baoshan, Yang Heng-zhou continued to expand outwards. Tengchong County in the west bore the brunt and the situation became critical, urgently sending a telegram to the provincial government for help. Yongping County, northeast of Baoshan, also fell into turmoil on the 13th. Yongping is a small, impoverished town, and the rebellious armed forces attacked it to use it as a passage. Advancing east to Xiaguan—a commercial area that boomed during the War of Resistance, with plenty of money and supplies—naturally became a target of covetousness. Yang's troops also occupied two major and strategic projects on the Yunnan-Burma Road—Gongguo Bridge and Huitong Bridge—with the aim of using the natural defenses of these two places to attack or defend as needed.</p>
<p>Half of the map of western Yunnan has disintegrated, and the Yunnan-Burma Road has been cut off section by section. The provincial government authorities have organized a Western Yunnan Suppression Headquarters, set up in Dali Prefecture. A large joint defense is being implemented in the eight counties of Dali. The military headquarters is located in Dali, and is presided over by Zhou Shu-xun, the commander of the Western Yunnan Garrison Area.</p>
<p>As of now, the situation in western Yunnan seems to be in a stalemate. The rebellious armed forces are eyeing Xiaguan and Dali with intense hostility, but dare not attack fortified positions. On the official side, the reinforced Security Regiments have arrived, but have yet to launch a counteroffensive to recover the lost territories, and the rebellions in the various counties remain as before.</p>
<p>Beacon fires are everywhere, and smoke signals rise everywhere. Western Yunnan has been ruined!</p>
<h3>Mayor of Hsinchu, Taiwan, Battles with Police Officers</h3>
<p>— Gu Liang</p>
<p>When Chairman Chen convened a provincial administrative meeting in Taipei on March 1, a small but significant ripple was stirred in the usually calm political waters of Hsinchu. It is said that this matter even reached the Garrison Headquarters! The reason is as follows:</p>
<p>More than ninety pages have been torn off the calendar, and the public employees of Hsinchu City are watching as prices rise day by day. News from Taipei reported that salaries for January were advanced at the end of January, and salaries for February were advanced at the beginning of February. In mid-February, salaries for March were advanced. Then came a series of good news about adjusting salaries starting in February. However, Hsinchu, only two and a half hours away from Taipei by train, only advanced 30,000 yuan per employee and 20,000 yuan per laborer during the Lunar New Year. Until March, there was no news of salaries for January being paid. They have been forced to a point where they can no longer survive, and their inner depression finally erupted. First, the staff of the police bureau initiated a report to Chairman Chen, recounting the difficult living conditions and requesting the provincial government authorities to resolve the matter reasonably. This report was personally delivered to Taipei by representative Mr. X, who was elected on March 3. Mr. X first went to the provincial government conference hall, but because the security was tight, the report could not be delivered directly to Chairman Chen. So he went to the chairman's residence and waited at the gate. But after waiting for a long time, he still had not succeeded. He managed to ask a friend to place the report on the chairman's desk.</p>
<p>When it was Mayor Chen Zhen-bin of Hsinchu's turn to report at the administrative meeting, it is said that Chairman Chen asked Mayor Chen, "Hsinchu City's land tax collection has reached over 90%, and other tax revenues are presumably also good. Why can't the salaries of public employees be paid?" The mayor blushed and could not answer. After the meeting, a section chief from the Department of Finance told Mayor Chen that Chairman Chen's words were based on the report from your Hsinchu City civil servants. (Because that report had already been sent to the Department of Finance for processing). When Mayor Chen heard this news, he was enraged. As soon as he returned to Hsinchu, he immediately summoned the chief secretary of the police bureau and asked who was behind it. The response was, "I don't know." He also asked, "Are the people in the police bureau also involved?" The response was, "Probably not!" The truth is that a group of small public employees, living hand-to-mouth, did it without consulting with their superiors, so the mayor could not find out the truth. The next day, he sent someone to the Department of Finance to copy the names of the people who made the report. After checking, it turned out that most of them were police officers from the police bureau. He immediately became furious, slammed the table, and shouted, "The police bureau is messing with me! These people (referring to the people who made the report) are all communists! They must be severely punished!" He immediately instructed Chen Shu-liang, the chief secretary of the city government, to summon two police bureau officers who were listed at the top of the report, and ordered the police chief to dismiss these people. At this time, it happened to be time to issue salaries for February (old pay scale). The mayor issued salary payment orders for all departments, but left out the police bureau's, saying, "Unless the names of the people who made the report are removed, the salaries will not be issued!" When this group of small public employees who made the report saw the mayor's attitude, they also held a meeting to discuss countermeasures. On the one hand, they petitioned higher authorities again, and on the other hand, they collected evidence of the mayor's corruption to report him. When the police chief saw that the situation was not right, he personally came forward to mediate, taking the blame on himself, and asking the people who made the report to write letters of repentance. This made the mayor think that the police chief was deliberately condoning his subordinates to mess with him. In a fit of anger, he ran to Taipei and told Director Wang of the Garrison Command that the police chief was deliberately "messing with him." He also reported to the Garrison Headquarters that "the staff of the police bureau are all communists!" The people at the Garrison Headquarters were shocked, "Is that so?" They quickly sent people to Hsinchu for a secret investigation. The result of the investigation was "not factual." This group of poor public employees who were labeled as communists were therefore discussing countermeasures again. It is not known how this farce will end!</p>

<h3>It is a Joy to Do Good: "Assisted Childbirth" Readers Respond with Donations in Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>Continued Support Needed in May From All Sectors</p>
<p>This newspaper's readership's assisted childbirth fund benefits impoverished pregnant women, and this fund relies entirely on continuous donations from all sectors of readership.</p>
<p>A week ago, this column reported that donations were very few, while prices were soaring, and the cost per pregnant woman was unbearable, fearing that it would be difficult to continue; therefore, we made an urgent appeal to readers from all walks of life, hoping that it would not be interrupted. We were honored to receive a letter from long-time reader Chang Le-ju, suggesting launching a silver dollar donation campaign to meet urgent needs; once it was disclosed, enthusiastic people from all walks of life responded one after another. We deeply admire their ancient virtues and warm hearts!</p>
<p>Among the donating readers, there was Mr. Sun Guo-hua, and the charitable person from "Fengji" who wished to remain anonymous, who personally came to the office yesterday and each donated ten silver dollars, and gave many instructions on how to promote assisted childbirth for poor women, which was especially inspiring.</p>
<p>The assisted childbirth expenses for April have now been barely met, but the assistance funds for the women giving birth this month have yet to be secured, and are awaiting continued donations from enthusiastic people from all sectors. Many hands make light work, and we dare to believe that this meaningful good deed will definitely not be abandoned halfway.</p>
