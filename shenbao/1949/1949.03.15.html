<h3>在滬初步接洽告段落　何院長定今晨晉京　顏惠慶江庸張君勱均謝絕入閣　青年黨原則上同意參加</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕何應欽院長在滬之初步組閣工作，接洽已吿一段落。靑年黨原則上不反對參加新閣，但尙需取決於黨內會議；張君勱則已謝絕參加，謂將以在野黨之地位，支持新閣。此外章士釗尙在考慮中，顏惠慶及江庸則均以高年及健康理由，表示無意參與。何院長在滬公畢，原定昨夜搭十一時快車晋京，路局已備就專單，但臨時又決定延期，至今晨七時啓行。何氏前日抵滬後，當晚七時親訪張君勱，邀請參加新閣，張氏婉謝，謂民社黨願以在野政黨之身份，協助新閣。九時赴地豐路左寓訪靑年黨諸首領進行會商，李璜·左舜生·謝澄平·林可璣等均出席，協商一小時餘始辭出，昨日上午，顏惠慶·陳光甫先後來訪，至十一時始辭行。何院長隨卽驅車往訪江庸·章士釗，懇邀參加新閣，當時汀庸表示北平之行，目的為全民爭取和平，今如參加政府，行將招致物議，諸多不便，此點務請何氏諒解。章士釗則尙在考慮中·午後一時許，吳市長及端木愷等，先後往訪，適何院長外出未歸，均未得晤。二時許財長徐堪應召往訪，長談幾兩小時，據何院長公開表示：新閣難題除和談之外，最感棘手者卽為經濟財政問題。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕新閣揆何應欽將於十五日午十二時自滬專車抵京，京中政界人士及正在集會中之立監兩院均以熱切之期待，迎候何氏之來京，尤寄望其能以革新之作風，迅速組成新閣。茲悉何氏新閣人選，經在滬與各方人士邀約徵詢意見後，業已大致就緒，僅俟返京後與李代總統請示後，卽可抉定。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕立委百餘人十四日舉行座談會，自由交換意見，有人主張應設法通知新閣揆早日提出閣員人選，現在大局嚴重，不容拖延，最好請何院長在下週五院會議提出施政報吿。</p>
<h3>簡化行政機構案　立院今進行討論　戡亂條款停止適用案亦列議程　和平意見書將重付表決</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕簡化行政機構，修正政院組織法條文案，經立院審查會通過後，已列入十五日第三會期第五次大會議程，此案如獲早日通過，可能對卽將組成之何應欽新閣有所影響，惟鑒於前次大會及審查會中討諭時之熱烈情形，提出院會或將仍有激辯。此外，列入十五日院會議程中之討論事項，尙有和平意見書重付表決案，廢止有關特刑庭之條例案，停止戡亂時期臨時條款之適用案，調整公敎人員待遇案及舉辦金價存款等案。</p>
<h3>蔣總統仍在溪口</h3>
<p>〔本報寗波十四日電〕外電傳蔣總統已離溪口故鄕移居厦門鼓浪嶼之說，頃已證明其完全不確。總統曾一度來甬遊覽，謠傳可能係因此而起。</p>
<h3>立委提議舉辦　「金價存款」</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕立委黃統等卅五人提議，舉辦金價存款，穩定金融，改善薪餉發給辦法，保障儲蓄，團結軍民人心案，列舉五項辦法如下：（一）舉辦「金價存款」，令人民將金圓券存入國家銀行，按存款時之金銀照價（牌價務與市價相合）折合現金列帳，准其定期或隨時支取，按支取時之金銀牌價折合金圓券支付，並照給利息，如有取用現金之必要時，仍照付現金，存款不辭零星小數，不拒少數存戶。（二）對公敎人員及士兵之薪餉所得，以戰前俸額餉章為定數，除按現時之生活指數發給足用之金圓券，並酌配現洋外，其有餘數與之列册記帳，作為長期存款，優給利息，如有婚喪大事或其他要需，准臨時支用。（三）軍人與公敎人員同樣辦理，惟對下級士兵另定一移歸本籍眷屬存儲之法，卽除給以現時足够生活之數與其本人外，將其餘數按月移歸其本籍之直系親屬或其所託付之人儲存支用，或待其退役後自取，此項存款，由該本籍縣政府照兵役册籍部隊移文，令該縣銀行妥為辦理。（四）對一般農商人民及工鑛企業者，則運用支票庫券公債等等政策，調劑金融，吸收通貨，開發生產，增加稅源，而以「金價存款」為鞏固信用，安定經濟之始基。（五）政府撥出充足準備之金銀及物資，設立替人民充分監督之存款基金保管委會，並運用外交，辦到經濟借款，加强信用。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕在京開會之立法。監察兩院委負，將於廿日舉行聯席談話會，十四日已由立委座談會決定，卽向監院各委員接洽，並進行籌備。立監委聯席會之醞釀已久，咸以當前時局嚴重，待決問題甚多，立·監兩院聯繫，發揮力量，殊為必要。</p>
<h3>李代總統令臺省府　軍令概歸陳誠指揮</h3>

<h3>鐵路郵電照新價收費　立委多表示憤慨　百餘人提議請有效制止</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕鐵路郵電於十一日起再度加價，當日卽經立院決議，請政院制止，並對新價不予承認，惟該案雖經議決並通知政院，但連日郵局。電局。路局以未奉到命令，仍照新價收費，多數立委對此極表憤慨，認為立院決議政院不予執行，有失立院威信·牛踐初等百餘委負決提出緊急動議，「制止交通事業漲價，行政院迄未執行，擬請採取有效措施案」，定十五日晨在院會中討論。該案所述理由中指出，制止漲價案，政院尙未執行，而近來物價飛漲，實由其刺激所致，應再行商討有效辦法，以全本院威信，而輕人民負祖。原動議附列兩項辦法：（一）立卽以電話通知交通部長來院，報吿何以朱執行本院制止漲價決議原因。（二）再咨行政院，卽日撤銷交通方面新公布之火車郵電價格。十四日下午立委全體座談會開會時，張慶楨亦於口頭上提出此事，各委員情緒咸極激昂，主張嚴厲質詢，惟以交都部長，次長現均未在京，當經決定請秘書長陳克文以立院名義電請交長或次長卽日飛京，列席十八日之院會，說明理由，並備質詢。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕立院政治革新綱領起草委會，十四日晨九時半開第四次會，鄒樹文主席，各委員續對政治革新問題發言，最後決定仍由前次推定之鄒樹文等九員整理意見，由袁其勛主稿，草擬政洽革新綱領，提交下次院會討論。</p>
<p>方復進一步要求中蘇邊境之海關條例，今後須全部停止實施，我方如同意此項要求，蘇方可避免我方海關之檢查，將各種違標貨物運入新省。在礦務方面，蘇方建議中蘇合組礦務公司，各出一半資本，開掘新省之「貴重及有色金屬」，而不許他國插足。我方對中蘇共同開發新省富源，並不反對，但堅持本身之立塲，要求對開採金屬之名稱種類，在協定中詳細載明，此點蘇方堅決不允，談判乃陷於停頓。據地質學家之研究，新省可能有鈾礦存在，故我方為維持國權起見，對此不允讓步。同時在蘇方之協定草稿中，要求該約有效時期為五十年，並規定礦產品新省本身不能使用者得外銷至蘇聯，我方如同意此條款，鈾礦一且發現自可銷至蘇境，因其不能在新疆使用也。而我方則主該約有效時期至多為五年至十五年。</p>

<h3>中蘇談判停頓　蘇方在搜求原子能所需鈾礦　我為維持國權不允讓步</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據權威方面透露：自本年一月起開始之中蘇商務談判，現已陷於停頓。按此項協定之內容，為准許蘇聯在新疆享有商業航空及開礦之各項特權，並使蘇方有機會探測製造原子能所需之鈾礦。莫斯科提出此項要求，遠在兩年前王廿杰主持外交之際，當時我國對此未加考慮，而蘇方鑒於環境之尙未成熟，亦未續作要求；最近，大局激變，政府內部親蘇空氣轉濃，蘇方始舊事重提，於此可見蘇聯外交之機動及現實性。中蘇商務談判之陷於僵局，原因有兩：在商務方面，蘇方要求在官方之易貨貿易之外，得在新省與私人及私營公司交易，此點我方尙可考慮，惟蘇</p>

<h3>北平型（三）</h3>
<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>（關於「局部和平」前後的一個城市的報道）</p>
<p>（二）共軍進入北平城</p>
<p>北平局部和平辦法的要點宣佈後，駐在城內的部隊，便馬上開始向城外移動，第一批出城的部隊，因共軍並未依照協定撤退三十華里，隨時與出城部隊發生接觸；而且少數共軍並向出城部隊的士兵「喊話」，叫他們投入解放軍。於是引起了部隊長和士兵們的憤怒，便互相火併起來，足足地打了兩個小時，後來幸經上級解釋後，共軍不再「喊話」，彼此約束，始行消釋這一塲誤會，其他部隊才陸續外開。</p>
<p>除原有華北剿總部所屬各軍事機關，經協定由傳作義自行辦理結束外。幾十萬部隊的調動，共計有四九兩個兵團司令部，八個軍，二十五個師，還要包括倉庫內武器彈藥，糧秣服裝等等的搬移，當然不是原來預計的三天時間所能辦妥，許多事實上的處理技術，頗費周折和考慮的。而且共方對於進城以後接收的準備工作，也是需要時間。所以一直到二月一日才有一部份共軍入城，宣吿成立聯合辦事處。在這一個多星期中，舊的忙於結束，新的尙未進城，幾乎成了眞空時間，許多比較關係重大的軍政人員，都花了重價乘機南飛；市面上散兵游勇頗多，搶劫案件每天有三五件發生。謠言尤其多，有說某某部隊不接受局部和平辦法，不願出城，還要打一打。掘發城內地雷，使其自動爆炸的隆隆之聲，也添了不少的刺激和緊張！總之謠言多而事實少，人民由猜測而懷疑，由懷疑便多了許多傳說，在這個時期，確是希望共軍能早日入城，打破許多疑問。</p>
<p>共軍的一部分政工人員，本來早已進城，分住在北京飯店和勵志社（卽翠明莊），以便隨時商洽接收辦法與手續，作一切接收工作的準備。可是共軍部隊的入城，却是在二月一日。那天有一部分武裝隊伍入城了，並且舉行了一個簡單的遊城式。這個進城式行列便是由華北剿總派了一輛廣播車領先，隨時向沿街的市民廣播說：「現在人民解放軍進城了，我們大家鼓掌歡迎吧！」於是沿途的市民便大家鼓掌表示歡迎。第二三兩輛車是載着少數的武裝共軍，和軍事管制委員會的職員，男女政治工作人員。第四輛車是警備總司令部派的武裝巡查車，以便隨時加以保護，而免發生意外。這個遊城式是經過北平東南西北四城的重要大馬路，共目的在給予市民一個印象，使他們知道共軍進城來了。</p>
<p>共軍進城當然不能這樣簡單。共黨所策動的學校和人民團體，固然要熱烈的歡迎一番，慶祝北平的「解放」；而共軍也想藉此作一次示威性的遊行，宣傳他們奪獲了國民黨朮隊多少武器，他們解放軍的武力是如何的强大！因此，二月三日便是共軍進入北平城，舉行入城式的日子。</p>
<p>今年的北平，天氣非常暖和，風沙也很少。二月三日突然黃沙蔽天，狂風肆虐，很不凑巧！但是風沙是阻不住他們的進城式，從早上八時起，東城王府井大街和東安門大街一帶便已擠滿了整齊的行列，四人一列的重列着兩列，浩浩蕩蕩向着天安門往南流；西城則以輔仁大學為中心，向着西四牌樓北大街一帶前進。因為共軍的進城路綫，是以前門大街的永定門為第一個入口，西直門為第二個入口，所以鞦迎的羣衆也配合着這兩個路綫。</p>
<p>歡迎羣衆多數是學生，大中小學的學生今日都出動了，敲着鑼鼓，化裝着各種怪模怪樣的角色，扭着秧歌舞，唱着共黨所編的各種解放歌曲。這些歡迎羣衆中，除了少數是他們的幹部，成為策動的中心外，還有一部分是投機分子，希望借此機會出出風頭，表現表現成績，以賣好於共黨。他們這些人的做作，比共黨幹部本身還要來得熱烈緊張和賣力！大多數的羣衆都是看熟鬧和無所謂的心情，從他們的行動和表情上，也就可以充分的證明。美聯祉記者穆薩和合衆社記者季昂所發的新聞電，說北平人民是以過去迎接征服者的心情，來迎接人民解放軍。如果是站在客觀的立塲上，或者不是共產黨的辯護人，都不能否定他們報導的正確性。這種說法實在是比較接近事實的！</p>
<p>共軍的進城部隊是包括步·騎·砲·和機械化部隊。偉大的行列，整齊的步伐，當然非常威武堂皇！尤其是從東北奪獲來的美式裝備，許多電武器如重砲，溜彈砲，各種大砲山砲，以及戰車，坦克車等，在從來沒有經過砲火的北平老百姓眼裏看來，眞是成武而驚奇！經過東交民巷，許多美僑看到這些東西，更有一種說不出的精神刺激！許多年靑學生門錦上添花的誇張捧塲，這裏也不必去詳叙了。共軍的入城式是這樣熱烈緊張的，在狂風飛沙中舉行過去，接着便是接收北平的工作開始了。（下接二版）</p>

<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕監察院對前任行政院長孫科之彈劾案，頃經監委熊在渭·金越光調查報吿後，經已宣吿成立，並將文件送出。此為近數年來監察院糾彈案中最鉅案件之一。據稱：該案係前三日審查通過者，但當時以孫辭行政院畏職，故延至十四日始行正式發表。彈劾文件中指明孫氏在行政院長任內曾處理其愛妾藍妮（卽藍業珍）之八十四桶顏料事，顯屬假借職權圖利，有辱官箴，應予嚴懲。熊·金二監委在其調查報吿文件中指陳：「我國政洽腐敗，今日已達極點，……欲挽回民心，收拾危局，最低限度必須建立廉潔政府。孫科以一國最高行政首長，受命於艱危之際，……乃竟貪圖私利，違法凟職，倘不予以嚴懲，何以平民憤而勵士氣……」據悉此案係孫氏前後在立法。行政兩院院長任內為其愛妾藍妮之要求發還顏料而引起者，彈劾全文長達五千餘言，其中詳述全部事業經過及孫科假借職權實情。據謂卅五年一月七日上海區敵偽產業處理局在天后宮橋倉庫查獲顏料八十四桶，其初所謂物主者無法證明其主權，詎於同年七月標賣後，忽於十月一日接立法院長孫科親筆簽名致劉攻芸函一件，謂此項顏料係「敝眷在滬所存」，說明「旣非敵產物資」，「自不能以來路不明，卽加沒收」，要求迅予發還。旋於卅六年五月，藍業珍（卽藍妮）具呈中央信託局蘇浙皖區敵產業淸理處，謂此項顏料係伊委託金康銀行辦理，勝利後，以漢奸嫌疑被捕，而為警局查封。迨卅五年一月獲釋，該批物資與人發生糾紛，要求調查，迅予發還。其後處長吳任滄亦先後接獲洪蘭友，樓桐蓀為藍案說項之函件，說明此項顏料係孫哲生如夫人藍業珍所有，請求提前核辦，其後該處轉呈行政院，奉批謂沒收顏料因仍未能提出有力證據，應飭補提，其後藍妮又先後具呈行政院，請求逕予發還，總政院發交蘇浙皖區處理敵偽產業審議委員會再為查明，當卽傳訊所有各關係人員後覆呈行政院。迨至最近孫科出長行政院長，蘇浙皖區處理敵偽產業審議委會突奉行政院一月十七日指令，准予發還，如不能以種類品質相同之物給付，應按時值佔價發還，該會乃決定交德僑產業淸理處就染料價格估定後予以發還，德產處以本案發還之顏料與申誚人主張之種類數量，與海關等紀錄何止百倍，究按何種顏料及數量為標準折算發還，尙在報會審定中。熊。金兩監委認為藍業珍所提人證不能認為有充分理由，而孫科不避嫌疑，代其愛妾關說，並託政府高級官吏代為運動，顯屬有辱官箴，其後且以行政院指令照時值發還，更屬假借職權，圖利愛妾，故特根據案　　情，提出彈劾。</p>

<h3>張肇元發表談話　聲明此案純係依法處理</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕行政院敵偽產業處理委員會主任委員張肇元，頃就藍某顏料案發表談話如次：「查本案顏料八十四桶，前由敵偽產業淸理處根據密報予以扣押，迭經顏料所有人藍某提出產權體件申請發還，拖延數年，久懸未決，行政院以此案係屬法律問題，經飭據司法行政部研擬意見，復稱：略以藍某旣未經法院判決為漢奸，其財產自不能視為逆產，藍某旣為此項顏料棧單之持有人，自應認定為該項財產之所有人，政府如欲予以沒收之處分，應負舉證之責，不能僅據密報遽予沒收。行政院參事鄂森及管歐均持同一主張，簽請將該項顏料發還，此乃本案在孫院長接長行政院以前之情形，有卷可查，太年一月初，行政院敵偽產業處理委員會淸理積案，將本案運同其他懸案三十餘件提出開會討論，經絕對大多數決議，該項顏料應予發還，亦有會議紀錄可查。行政院敵偽產業處理委員會照例將決議案移送行政院秘書處，令飭蘇浙皖區敵偽產業審議會審核，審核結果，通知中央信託局敵偽產業淸理處辦理佔價手續，以備依價發還，蓋因該項顏料平已出售，計得法幣二千餘萬元，解交國庫，但主管當局鑒於監察院有調查本案之說，業已通知中央信託局條浙皖區敵偽產業淸理處暫停進行，聽候調查，故迄今並未發還分文，依照目前市價估計，全部顏料價款，尙不及美金五千元，此案行政當局純係依法處理，與孫院長個人毫無關係，而類似本案情形之案件多起，亦經行政院敵偽產業處理委員會決議發還，固未嘗有所軒輊也」。</p>

<h3>社論　名副其實的責任內閣</h3>
<p>—對何院長希望之二—</p>
<p>何應欽將軍昨天整日在滬，與各方商談組閣問題，尤注重於新閣如何解決目前的經濟危機。大局如此緊迫，朝野都希望何將軍即日入京，進行新閣的組織，看趨勢，這次內閣的改組，當不致再像上次翁孫兩任交接時拖延到三個星期之久了。</p>
<p>我們且慢談關於政治，經濟，軍事等等目前所應採取的政策，先來提出一個政制的根本問題，就是：何將軍能否組成一個名副其實的責任內閣？</p>
<p>年來中國政治之所以無進步，所以不上軌道，最大的毛病就在始終沒有樹立起一種適合現代潮流的政治制度。但這新制度是一個在蛻變時期的中國所不能不趕快樹立的。極樣國家靠人治：民主國家靠法治。人治容有人治的優點，決斷速，效率强，然而大權集中，獨裁專斷之流弊亦特別大。法治在某些地方或感紆緩，牽制極多，不免减少效率，然而權責分明，運行有序，政治比較易上軌道。中國現已號稱行憲，而中華民國憲法又明明規定行政院是責任內閣的性質，則今天醫治中國的政治病首先就當從這根本　結醫起；可惜以往許多人只注意到鬧人事，只注意到爭地位，却很少能撇開複雜的人事關係和封建的地位觀念，大家同心協力，讓一個眞正的責任內閣制度建立起來。目前何將軍的組閣，應該不再隨便漢視這個制度。</p>
<p>按照憲法第五十七條，行政院對立法院負責，所謂負責者，即負執行立法院所贊同的政策之責。換言之，行政院除於執行其政策及立法院決議之法案時，對立法院負責外，其他實無所謂負責。而行政院院長為要實行負責計，對於選探閣員自有其樣衡，應該不受任何方面的干涉與牽制。憲法第五十六條明明規定：「行政院副院長，各部會首長，及不管部會之政務委員，由行政院院長提請總統任命之。」由此可見責任內閣之組成，不但立法院或立法委員不能預先干涉行政院院長所物色的閣員人選，就是總統也不當有所可否於其間，因為中國憲法所採行的不是美國的總統制。</p>
<p>現在何將軍旣被李代總統提名，又獲立法院大多數票的通過，出任行政院院長，我們相信在各方要求確立責任內閣制度之際，李代總統和立法委員必能信任何將軍，使他在禾就新職以前有共物色閣員的完全自由。我們希望這次是一個良好政制實行的開始；所以特別要請何院長重視自己的名位，職樣，與責任，儘管可以犬公無私，羅致人才，但在法律上却決不必像以前那些院長一般，左來一個「請示」，右來一個「奉諭」。豈但在用人方面羅致閣員如此，就是在行政方面，只要政策一經立法院的贊同，也便該負責幹去，不能而且不當再在「請示」或「奉諭」之下推諉自己的實任。</p>
<p>然則何院長今天所面對的現實問題是什麼呢？總括起來，不外用人行政，就是：（一）如何物色閣員？（二）決定什麼政策？關於政策，當然其主題是謀取和平的實現，容待我們續論，在這裏先說應該怎樣去物色閣員。我們願提出兩項原則，貢獻何院長作參考：</p>
<p>第一，求人才。今天人們聽了「黨派」「派系」等等名詞，已感頭痛萬分。國事之所以糟到如此，就是黨派或派系觀念在暗中作祟！入主出奴，黨同伐異，已成為年來的時尙，「一朝天子一朝臣」，至今還隱約如此。充其流弊之所至，同學校，同社團，同俱樂部，省縣同鄕，乃至……裙帶關係，均可成為分贓的根據。於是施政不問政策，辦事不講效率，只要搭上關係，就可鷄犬皆昇。官塲風氣，每况愈下，眞正人才，不是隱逸，就是沉淪，還有誰能脫穎而出？何况處此艱危之局，禮賢下士，尙恐難得眞才，若就上門奔競的一羣中去羅致，或已等而下之了。我們知道何院長自國防部長辭馴以來，連私人秘書都沒有一位，這種風度已很難得，今天奉命組閣，應該放大眼光，放寬胸襟，絕對天下為公，虛心延攬人才，徵求一人之入閣，只問其眞是人才與否，而初不必計及那一黨，那派，那一系，那一校，那一社，那一省，尤其不能誤於「前進」，「落後」，「開明」，「頑固」，「民主」，「反動」，……等等一類挑撥離閒的名詞，而使野有遺賢，朝多倖進。</p>
<p>第二，負責任。當艱屯之會，求佐衡之才，不但要有學議，有才具，而尤須肯負責任。每見不少才能之士，混迹宦途的日期一多，就染了唯唯否否，推三宕四的一派官僚習氣。此輩人物，未始無才，但未必能荷担大任，因為缺少了肩膀。所貴乎責任內閣者，不但院長須總負其責，即閣員亦須對院長各負其主管分內執行政策之責。假使院長所物色者，太半都是事事請示，件件交擬的「蓋章」主官，那就離責任二字太遠了。沒有眞能負責的閣員，只靠一位院長，那裏能組成一個名副其實的責任內閣？</p>
<p>我們讀史，每覽歷代之興亡盛衰，莫不絮於人才之進退。君子道消，小人道長；小人道消，君子道長。雖云大勢所趨，然而旋乾轉坤，也就只在居高位者目光之一轉。人才，人才，何時無之？何地無之？就看大權在握的人能識與否，能用與否，用之能得當與否耳。何院長當不致辜負人民的期望吧！</p>

<h3>北平型</h3>
<p>〔自第一版接來〕在二月十二日正是舊歷的正月十五日，北平市各人民團體及學生為慶祝北平解放，又舉行了一個盛大的慶祝會，從早上七時起，全城各個角落裏，都在集合羣衆，分別的出發。慶祝大會的時間，本來是規定在上午十時舉行，然而九時前的天安門前便已擠得滿滿的，東西以三座門為範圍，南面更向前延伸了一些，沒有開會以前，鑼鼓喧天，各個團體的藝工隊，都在扭着秧歌舞，爭奇鬥勝，各不相讓。其中尤以華北人民大學的藝工隊，究竟是經過訓練來的，秧歌舞扭得特別標準而道地，許多想要學習秧歌舞者，都在熱烈而聚精會神的注意他們和她們的動作。中共每到一個地方，首先在當地民衆發生影響的，便是解放歌曲和扭秧歌舞的普遍傳習。「東方紅，太陽升，中國出了一個毛澤東，他是中國人民的大救星，他是中國人民的大救星。……」是三歲小孩都學會哼一哼的歌曲。秧歌舞本來是華北和東北農村人民，在舊歷正月裏扭着玩兒的民間藝術，步法簡單，只要有鑼鼓配着。到處都可以扭，現在也成了中共的代表作。北平實現局部和平後，也到處可以聽到解放歌曲的歌聲，和扭着秧歌舞。</p>
<p>葉劍英在慶祝會上，說明了北平解放的意義，及軍事管制的任務。他說為着達成軍事管制的任務，還要逮捕必須逮捕的戰犯，及反動派的首要分子。這到是給予人民一個具體的印象，北平局面的愈超愈緊，當是一種必然的現象。</p>
<p>（三）他們的旗幟是　鐮刀斧頭和一顆星</p>
<p>一般的宣傳，北平是實現「局部和平」，中共中央的正式聲明裏，特別指出北平局部和平的模範作用。他們的意思是希望全國各地的軍政長官都效法傅作義將軍，以北平的局部和平作榜樣。北平的局部和平無形中便成了一種，北平型的和平了！共黨城工部的人員，也在城內傳佈着，北平局部和平實現以後，今後將成立聯合政府，與瀋陽長春天津的解放是不相同的。在北平的接收工作，也是成立聯合機構負責辦理，共方四個人，傳方三個人。共方的四人是葉劍英，徐冰，陶鑄，戎子和；傅方的三人是郭宗汾，周北峯，焦實齋。由這七人組織一個委員會，葉劍英任主任委員，郭宗汾任副主任委負，共同負責辦理交接工作。表面上這也是一種聯合的形式。但是共軍在北平外城的城牆上所寫的大字標語，却是「傅作義率部投誠」。這葫蘆裏究竟賣的是什麼藥呢？將來究竟會是一個什麼一局面呢？住在北平城裏的人民，他們是親眼看到許多現象，親身體騐到許多事實，不能不發生疑問。</p>
<p>共產黛是不是在北平組織政府？用一種什麼政治體制？什麼名稱？什麼旗幟？……這一連串的問題，都在居留人民的腦中，希望得到答覆。</p>
<p>據筆者個人的體認，共產黨是必然要在北平成立一個全國性的人民政府，至於成立的時間和方式，當要以大局的發展和國際方面的變化為定。或者是在新政治協商會議以後，正式組成也很可能。根據毛澤東在抗戰時期所發表的「新民主主義論」和「論聯合政府」的兩篇文字，以及最近新華日報的社論和中共的廣播，未來的全國性人民政府，仍是一種聯合政府的形式，實行三三制，共產黨佔三分之一，國民黨進步分子及各民主黨派佔三分之一，社會賢達佔三分之一。新華日報社論上說：「在全國範圍內推翻國民黨的反動統治，在全國範圍建立無產階級及領導的，以工農聯盟為主體的人民民主專政的共和國』。又說：『一九四九年將要召集沒有反動分子參加，以完成人民革命任務為目標的政治協商會議，宣吿中華人民民主共和國的成立，並組成共和國的中央政府，這個政府將是一個在中國共產黨領導之下的，有各民主黨派各人民團體的適當的代表人物參加的民主聯合政府』。這不是已經很明顯的說明了他們的態度和做法嗎？據最近報紙所傳，各黨派人士在藩陽開會商議的結果，政治體制將採取聯邦制。他們的國體名稱，叫做「中華人民民主共和國」，旗幟是鐮刀，斧頭，和一顆星，紅地黃花。現在解放軍所用的旗幟，便都是這樣的旗幟。根據這許多條件和事實，當然對於現有的南京國民政府，是一個根本的否定和推翻。毛澤東的八項和平聲明中，廢除偽怯統和廢除偽憲法，也已經露骨的說出了這番意思。（待續）</p>

<h3>書業不獲貸款指責國行不公　貼放委會發表聲明　商務等所得非紙貸　係印刷國定教科書用者</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會，頃以報載上海書商業同業公會會員四百十六家，為中央銀行配紙不公，質詢中央銀行總裁劉攻芸及業務局局長林崇墉之緊要啟事，發表如次之聲明：商務印書館等書局，經教育部核准承印國訂本教科書，歷有年所，每年兩季均經四聯總處核准，由國家行局貸款，使課本定價特廉，藉以减輕全國中小學學生負担，並非為配紙而予貸放者。迨四聯總處奉命撤消，業務移歸國行貼放委員會辦理後，教育部曾於上年十二月間致函國行，請根據成案，予以貸放四千四百六十二萬元，並派代表來滬協商。當經該會核准貸放一千五百萬元，其貸放家數，以及分配比例，均照教育部意見辦理。今年二月，十九家書局以物價波動甚烈，以前所貸之數，不敷應用，復函請國行增加貸額。經二月十四日第廿六次貼放委員會議決，准照前案增貸為一億五千萬元，仍指定為印刷國訂本教科書之用。至萬葉書店等四家，亦係奉准承印國訂教本，並持有教部證明，申請貸款，經國行貼放會將一億五千萬元項下之餘額一百五十萬元，平均分貸，每家計約三十七萬餘元。</p>
<h3>申請配紙墊款　無例不便貸放</h3>
<p>二月廿五日百新書局等四百六十六家申請配紙墊款，經照例提出本月一日廿八次貼放會核議，其時出席委員，感以過去商務印書館等所貸之款，係用於印刷國訂本教科書，並非配紙墊款，四百六十六家所請，逈不相同，又無先例可援，不便貸放，且國行為扶助小型工廠，辦有小型工貸，此四百餘家書局附設有印刷所，並合乎小型工貸之規定，得按其規模設備，申請小型工貸，以資因應，當經議決，本案應予婉却。以上為國行貼放會核准十九家貸款以及婉却其他書局經過情形。</p>
<h3>理髮浴室業代表　請修改計價辦法　社局諭俟書面提出再核</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市理髮業，浴室業代表七人，昨日下午赴社會局請願，對市政會議通過基數乘生活指數辦法，請予修改，渠等希望根據物價指數，或提出基數，社局答以將具體意見用書面提出，再行核定。</p>
<h3>書業推代表赴國行洽商</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據書業公會昨宣稱：本市出版業前因外匯移轉證激漲，致第六季配紙無法訂購，而各書局存紙早經用罄，如紙張供給中斷，則各出版業勢必被迫停業，影響精神食糧之供應，至為重大，爰經該業公會先後據情轉請中央銀行援照報業墊款全部代定，而中央銀行僅准少數大書局（十九家）貸款，而對四百餘家書局之請求，則予拒絕，事為全市書店聞悉，羣情惶急，紛起質詢，除刋登各報籲請各界主持公道外，聞該公會昨已公推理事長張一渠，監事長杜月笙，曁常務理事虞舜，黃仲明，王子澄等，居間謀求解決，定今日（十五日）赴中央銀行謁劉總裁洽商云。</p>
<h3>預拋棉紗欺騙　被捕提起公訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕海寗路萬興棉紗號經理曾阿林（在逃）及股東孫志文，范九福等，自本年二月十六至十九日內，預拋與裴德怡，虞景華，張福圻，丁海堃，齊是我等藍鳳，獅馬，雙地球等棉紗各一二件，共收款二百二十餘萬元後，卽行逃逸，旋由被害人在途中與孫等相遇，當扭送警局，移送地檢處偵查起訴。</p>
<h3>江蘇路命案眞相迄難明　認定兇手不止一人　旣非仇殺亦非謀財</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江蘇路七六弄A字四六號主婦吳李秀珍被謀殺一案，連日雖經各方努力偵查，但仍無重要發現，據記者自各有關方面探詢結果，對兇手部份至少可認定數點：（一）死者致命創口計有十六處，係戳傷而非砍傷，死者屍體跪於床前，且行兇時房內之收音機被移置後門，發音頗大，可證兇手決不止一人。（二）死者家庭人口雖多，但清晨卽赴工廠作工或入校讀書，上午祗有死者一人在家，兇手恰於此時動手，可證預謀已久，且對死者家庭似異常熟悉。（三）死者嫁其夫吳士仁已十一年，因秉性忠厚，家庭及鄰居間，均相處甚睦，且渠管理家務，甚少外出，過去亦從無與人口角，借貸，涉訟等事，兇手於行兇後亦未携走任何財物，可證此案並非仇殺或謀財。據一般猜測：死者嫁吳時已卅五歲，則兇手可能係渠卅五歲前之相識，或因某種問題懷恨在心，其後又遠適他鄕，最近始得機下此毒手。但據記者訪問死者母家後，渠等表示對此點無法加以肯定，因死者未嫁前從未有戀愛，及與人失和等情事，故決不致發生今日類似情殺之事件云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海區國立專科以上學校教授聯誼會，昨日下午在交通大學舉行第六次常會。會中對待遇問題，認為前次校長晋京請願時，教部負責人已面允照五百倍發給，事後教部忽來電指示，三月份薪金需按二月份標準七十五倍之三倍計算，實言而無信，決定對政府發表抗議書，堅持原薪不打折扣及按照物價指數發給二原則，一面並請各校長趕發三月份薪金。對各校自費生爭取公費事，表示同情。該會決定成立福利會，由同濟·上醫·上商三校負責推動。致函復旦大學經濟硏究所及中國經濟硏究所，請供給物價指數資料，與該會福利會經常保持聯繫。</p>

<h3>流亡學生問題　當局深感棘手　膳食將有中斷之虞</h3>

<h3>各校職員催發實物</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海國立專科以上學校職員聯誼會已推定交大·復旦·曁南·同濟·上商五校為常務理事，以曁南變該會通訊處。該會除已請各院校校長轉請當局撥發進修費外，並致電李代總統·立法院·行政院及教育部呼籲。此外並決定會同教授聯誼會及市立中小學教職員聯誼會，催請有關機關速發配給煤球及食油。</p>

<h3>自費生請願　行期尚未定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市國立大專學校聯合會晋京請願代表之行期尚未定。同時各校公費同學亦認為公費不足，膳食過壞，要求按物價指數調整公費，與自費同學爭公費合而為「爭生存」運動。交通大學學生已成立爭生存委員會，並定本週四舉行訴苦晚會，訴述目前師生員工生活之困苦情形。</p>
<h3>市立中小學教職員　謁教局長要求五項</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市市立中小學教職員聯誼會，目前推派代表奚楨墾，周和，李占仁，茅文培等晋謁教局李局長，要求數點：（一）二月份薪津請依照原有底薪不打折扣，乘生活指數，補發差額。（二）三月份薪津請卽依照原底薪乘生活指數，速卽預發。（三）公教實物配給拖欠食油，煤球等數期，請轉咨主管機關迅卽補發，並望以後能按期發放。（四）請速參照其他文官底薪提高教師底薪，以重教育。（五）請求本市公教人員福利待遇一律，市校教職員同仁子女亦可得教育貸金。李局長對該項請求，表示可轉呈市長候核。</p>

<p>昨日座談會對私立大專本學期之春假問題，決定假期以三天為原則，放假日期由各校自定。</p>
<h3>平津大學生抵滬　談北方教育　中共在平辦三大學</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕北平輔仁大學學生張振東等五人，朝陽大學生李紹淵等數人，與天津國立國術體師專校學生吳正陶等九人，日前來滬，記者特往旅寓訪問，詢其平津校况，據朝陽等校學生云，他們一行十餘人，於上月二十六日由平去津，廿七日復興國術體師同學九人偕行，經滄縣，轉濟南，因領有通行證，沿途無阻，及至靑島登記，免費乘輪，於十二日到滬。現在中共在平辦有大學三校，（一）華北大學，兩年畢業。（二）軍政大學。（三）人民革命大學，四個月畢業。原來之國立大學學生副食費，每人發四十五斤小米，教授為一百廿斤小米。私立大學因經費來源缺少補助，收費又相當限制，致學校頗難維持，學生除志願投入中共所辦之三大學外，頗難在私大讀書。據國術體師學生談，該校由教授會就教授中推一人臨時代理校務，中共派有指導員二人到校，將訓導處取消，課程方面，童軍，軍訓，公民，倫理，國文等課（國文俟修訂教材）不上，體育改為勞働服務。教員除授課外，早間有學習會，閱讀指定之圖書。晚間舉行檢討會，檢討學習問題。師生於勞働服務，能力合作云云。聞南來三校各生，將赴杭向教部辦事處商轉學問題。並聞平津其他大學如北大等校及東北大學學生，亦有數十人來滬，向市教局接洽，局方對食住問題有所指導，於轉學寄讀，囑俟教部派來負責人員再逕與接洽。</p>

<h3>撲滅湘西野火　撫重於剿釜底抽薪</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　黃潮如</p>
<p>〔本報長沙五日航訊〕湘西位雲貴高原的尾間，重嶺疊嶂，地方貧擠。這裏本屬化外之區，淸雍正苗亂後才改土歸流。但國地形特殊，人民知識水準低落，雖然改土歸流，地方勢力還是特別濃厚，所區別的，不過統治權由苗酋手裏轉移到一些漢人惡霸手裏。一直到抗戰發生，湘西在國人心目中還是一塊神秘之區。那裏是土匪充塞，豪劣橫行，外人鮮有涉足其間的。</p>
<p>抗戰發生後，因為地形關係，湘西得天獨厚，敵蹄始終沒有踏進這塊土地，它竟成了世外桃源，流亡羣爭趨其間。閉關的湘西，大門給打開了。可是「下河人」（湘西人目常桃以下的人，凡是非湘西土著，均呼「下河人」，猶之四川人之視外省人均稱「下江人」）湧進這塊神秘之區，也並不很容易。當初政府很費過一番手脚的。先是千計百方，調虎離山，把「湘西王」陳渠珍的子弟兵調出湖南，接着請陳本人到重慶附郊去做寓公。另外再由中央派老虎司令谷正倫在芷江設憲兵總司令部，負責湘西剿匪的任務，谷老虎在湘西，為圖根除匪患，有時不惜整個一村一村的屠戮。省府也在沅陵設立行署，並成立警備司令部。其時警備司令孫常鈞，在那種地方惡勢力未曾根本剷除時，公文簡直不能出司令部大門一步。孫司令在一再遷就優容中，煞費苦心的應付環境，等到一個相當時機，用迅雷不及掩耳的手段，給他殺了一個著名的惡霸，才能鎭壓一時，秩序漸入正軌。以後，不僅沅陵·芷江成了「下河人」的樂園，連到乾城·永綏等地也都有異鄕人的踪跡。等到國立商學院·國立八中·茶洞師範等先後在這塊蠻荒之區設校後，山之嶺，水之涯，都能看到生龍活虎的靑年學子，聽到時代先驅的弦歌之聲。那時住在這地區的人，誰都不會想到這就是數年前為異鄕人視為畏途不敢涉足的神秘之區。湘西蛻變，面目全非了。</p>
<p>湘西人不怕硬</p>
<p>湘西改了面目，神秘揭開，它給予「下河人」的印象：這裏的老百姓並不是想像中的紅眼綠眉毛的公道大王，而是馴良善和的中國老實百姓的典型。抗戰初期，記者從遙遠的長江下游，流亡到這裏，最感興趣的，這裏竟是一個路不拾遺的地方，衣服晒在稻塲上，夜間不收藏到屋裏，不會有遺失的事情發生。湘西人性情傻直倔強，好武鬥狠，最心偸竊行為，生活不能解決，拿一把菜刀去殺人越貨才是大家崇拜的英雄。他們最不怕硬，任何壓力都要去反抗的。記得湘西會戰前夕，駐在常桃一帶的十八軍，紀律太壞，常桃老百姓和綿羊般的馴順，從不敢反抗。後來該軍開拔到辰谿一帶，有一師紀律最壞的駐在浦市，強佔民房，引起當地人的反感，他們集合了槍支刀矛，夜襲軍營，竟殺了八十多個國軍，握有新式武器的十八軍，竟給這些不怕死的湘西佬壓住了。</p>
<p>野心家又抬頭</p>
<p>八年抗戰中，湘西人和全國其他地區的人同樣的出錢出力，尤其出力，因為湘西人好鬥，不怕當兵，所以征兵特多。不過，情形也不見得就十分順利。前面說過的，湘西的眞正統治權完全握在少數幾個豪劣手裏，征兵是要經過鄕保甲之手的，鄕保甲長就是豪劣代表或爪牙，善良的湘西老百姓，難免受到鄕保甲長的魚肉，於是在永順一帶有著匪彭叫驢子，以抗西抗糧為號召，橫行湘西，達數載之久。直到抗戰勝利時才給傳仲芳剿平了。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，湖南的政治重心遷回長沙，大批「下河人」絡續離開湘西，漸漸地，這裏又變成「天高皇帝遠」的世界，地方少數具有野心份子，慢慢抬頭，他們利用窮老百姓種烟·抗糧·抗丁的心理，在地方製造毒素，一到時機成熟抓住一個機會，就揭竿而起。從勝利到今天，三個年頭了，應該是成熟了，因此，在整個國家局勢動盪中，湘西先天下之亂而亂，又走上了十年前的混亂局面。今日湘西，竟是到處烽火，整個的在騷動中。</p>
<p>豪劣們握大權</p>
<p>此次湘西事變的爆發，是由於十七綏靖區收編地方槍支而起。湘西民槍特多，據非正式統計，約在十萬以上。十七綏區想利用這些民槍為國家所用，用意未可厚非。不過技術上欠周，尤其忽略了這裏的地方勢力，想單純的用政治力量，達其目的。在其他地方，百姓怕管（官），一紙明令，準可辦到然而湘西情形就不太簡單，民槍是握在一些豪劣們手裏，說好聽些，這是他們保護自己身家性命，說不好聽些，他們完全倚恃這些民槍在地方培植自己的勢力。如今政府想從他們手裏奪了去，當然要激起反感。去年農暦臘月間，十七綏區派員到永順，要地方民槍（自衛隊）改編為勘建大隊，功令雷厲風行，縣長自然奉命辦理，握了民槍大權的自衛總隊附（兼永順警察局長）曹振亞，宣吿叛亂了。</p>
<p>野火起燒不盡</p>
<p>在永順事件未爆發前，湘西就已有不少縣份情形不穩，保靖有黃麒（卽被殺於大庸的黃穎川縣長的胞弟）為了憤怒乃兄大仇未報彙有人槍數千；古丈有個羅炳武，也有千餘人；龍山有陳子霞·羅雲等聚集了數百人；還有一位湖大學生田光　小姐，因乃父田和中被人暗殺起兵復仇，人槍也在六七百左右；桑植有個中學生胡閠；麻陽的龍飛天聲勢更大。永順曹振亞一舉，他們都如響斯應，紛紛揭竿而起，造成一個全面的戰局。近數日間，麻陽最先被龍飛天攻陷，接着湘西心臟的沅陵被曹振亞攻下，瀘溪·辰谿都成了危城。截止記者執筆時，湘西巨鎭浦市亦吿陷落。野火燒不盡，春風吹又生，血腥的湘西，竟又重見於十年後的今天。</p>
<p>對付湘西變亂，省政當局決定撫重於剿，一面派兵鎭壓，一面派省委戴季韜等前往宣導。戴是鳳凰人，二十餘年前在湘西也就是今日的曹振亞輩，在陳渠珍名下當過師長，抗戰時率部效命過疆塲，較其他湘西的武人有頭腦。以他的聲望，到了湘西，後輩如曹振亞輩，少不得要低一下頭的。大家都熱望戴委員此行不虛，用釜底抽薪的辦法，把湘西野火撲滅於無形。</p>

<h3>紹自衛第三分隊　索欠餉不遂譁</h3>
<p>〔本報紹興十二日訊〕本縣自衛總隊部駐平水車頭（距城四十餘里）自衛第三中隊於十日下午九時突然譁變，經查該中隊以一月份餉迄未發淸，而二月份餉發放之希望更屬渺茫，雖經由第三分隊長張志英迭墾中隊長兪鶴鳴轉向總隊部請求發放，終無效果，致激起第三分隊全體隊士忿怒，乃於十日下午九時，由張分隊長命令全體隊士集中，哄至附近第一分隊駐紥處，將其全部繳械，且將第一分隊指導員陳忠樵挾持而去。第二分隊獲訊，急往追擊，因係背道而行，未能遭遇。翌晨第一分隊指導員陳忠樵脫險來城，向兼總隊長林澤，副總隊長侯莊燕分別報吿，林兼總隊長聞訊，除將中隊長兪鶴鳴收押外，並通飭警所及商請駐軍分路兜剿。</p>
<h3>河西水利工程</h3>
<p>— 本报记者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州九日航訊〕甘省府為重建河西，以利用祁連山雪水灌漑農田，經與水利部河西水利工程處合作勘測興修，本年除尚須勘測設計之工程三處，必須請款興建，以期增產小麥五十萬石外，本年興辦及整修灌漑工程，將可全部如期完成，預計可灌田四十九萬畝，每年可增產小麥五十萬石；倘連同小型水利一倂統計，則可灌田八十九萬畝，每年可增產小科七十七萬石，收穫殊堪驚人。</p>
<p>目前河西水利工程進行之槪况，較重要者有下列數處：</p>
<p>（一）山丹白石崖河，供給軍馬飲水及灌漑工程：是項工程之地點，在山丹大馬營軍牧塲及祁連山麓之間，牧塲內水源缺乏，未能開墾之荒地，約三萬餘畝。擬在白石崖口攔河築堤引水，以供給軍馬飲用，兼及灌漑，全部工程已設計完成。惟水利部因見於該項工程與其他工程性質不同，未予批准，省府刻已另請國防部及西北軍政長官公署核撥專款辦理。</p>
<p>（二）山丹截引地下水灌漑工程：此為解決河西水荒之最經濟，最簡易工程，上年貸款法幣二百卅一億元，於五月開工，復洽准政院處理美國救濟物資委員會援助工款，前後共得法幣三百億元，刻已完成全部工程百分之七十五，本年間向西延長，竣工後可灌田六千畝。</p>
<p>（三）酒泉中渠堡截引地下水灌漑工程：卽將於春暖施工，完成後可灌田一萬二千畝，每年增產小麥二萬石。</p>
<p>（四）酒泉邊灣截引地下水灌漑工程：本年春季可先墾灌一萬畝；夾邊灣小型蓄水庫已完工。</p>
<p>（五）古浪古台渠整修工程：已洽准水利部貸款法幣一百卅五億元，又續撥金圓劵四萬三千三百元，先計劃施灌八千畝。</p>
<p>其餘在古浪大靖河舊渠整修工程，已在整修中。臨澤五眼渠及昔喇渠整修工程，亦設計完竣，送請水利部以美援辦理。關外安西之布隆吉截引地下水灌漑工程，正在進行中。</p>
<p>金塔鴛鴦池上年增高溢洪道及補修工程，業經全部竣事，已較前增加蓄水量三分之一，本年可增灌田三萬畝，連同灌漑量共為十三萬畝，每年可增產小麥十三萬石。</p>
<p>主持河西水利工程之甘省水利局局長兼河西水利工程處處長黃萬里氏，刻以有關河西水利事業，均待與水利部洽商，故擬於最近期內，飛穗一行。</p>

<h3>京滬一千五百餘公里　江防線上透視</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　和香林</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江十三日訊〕由於時局動盪，大局在晦明之間，長江下游自本月九日起，實行封鎖了，鎭江當面的六圩，十二圩，瓜洲，各公司班輪均奉命一律停航，不准南來北去，整個江面在沉寂狀態中。可是，居住在鎭江的人們，並不因此心慌，在今天，長江無疑的，已面臨着歷史的重大考騐。</p>
<p>「等是有家歸不得」，「一江春水向東流」這兩句詩，正可以代表今日鎭江碼頭上的寫照。過去這裏有熙來攘往的人羣，動力的呼者，但自九日全面封江後，這些完全消失了，雖然平政橋上許多人在引領翹望，但看到的是幾艘停泊在江心的軍艦，和那茫無邊際的江水，更使人心頭上感到空虛悵惘。第一綏區司令部為了應付這個船舶進出口管理的問題，已在江邊成立一個船舶管理處鎭江管理站，處十日起，已開始辦公，由建設廳技正唐學俊兼任站長，正積極展開工作。</p>
<p>在一切軍事為前提的大原則下，「封江」當然是必要的，多半是過而不留，許多物資，都需要江北供給，俐如猪肉，蔬菜，糧食，柴草等物，在封江後，都飛漲了幾倍，此外，直接受影響的，是許多民船，輪船，因為停航了，幾千個船員，碼頭工人，已感到無法維持生活，輪船業公會曾經召集緊急會議討論關於停在江北岸被征用的輪船問題，船員們的伙食與煤斤消耗，過去由兵站方面津貼，而現在要由他們自己高潮，並決定每條船再加上一噸半的煤來維持軍運。</p>
<p>鎭江縣長謝泌，他對於封江後的物資來源及治安問題，也很關心。十一日會同城防指揮官王有智緊急決定：（一）由車站下車之旅客，擬由金山河乘小划船繞道渡江北上者，由省警局及交通控制站勸導散開，不得　集該地，以免滋生事情。（二）銀樓業營業時間，規定為下午六時前打烊。（三）自封江後，失業工人及話費短少之旅客由商會與工會同商一數字，擬具詳細辦法，請求省府救濟。（四）鎭江柴草，素來仰給於對江之世業洲及和尚洲等地，自封江後，市民燃料頓成問題，由有關單位擬具妥善辦法，請示省府辦理。（五）水電公司存煤僅够維持至十五日，雖然南京有一百多噸煤，但因拖船被封，不能運鎭，決定由城防指揮部發給護照，搶運來鎭。</p>
<p>據一位軍事觀察家發表見解，他認為長江畢竟是條大江，非人海戰術所能奏效，所以共軍渡江，就不能不另求計謀，一般說來，他們渡江的方法，不外：（一）趁月黑風高之後，實行偸+渡。（二）邊談邊渡，以渡為談和的先決條件，過江來再說。（三）「有錢買得鬼推磨」，將儘量利用黃金白銀作為買路錢偸渡。（四）是硬派的想法，直接打過江來。綜觀上面四項方法：（一）大批偸渡易為海空軍所發現，在使用之前，可能先予摧毀，使共軍無法集結，假如是零星偸渡，此種兵力究屬有限，在立足未穩之前，更易為海陸空協力打擊，所以說，共軍是不作此不智之舉的。（二）國軍中不乏才智之士，對如此騙詐之道當亦洞悉。（三）可能性較大，和平不成，共軍只有遇到意外的挫折，從歷史上的遠近看法，像梁紅玉打敗金兀术，像白崇禧擊潰孫傳芳，就是最好的前車之鑑。</p>
<p>京滬區是全國政治經濟的中心，地位尤比北平瀋陽重要。如果共軍取得了，無疑的可以改變國際形勢，這一點，國軍當然看得很淸楚，決心保衛這一塊地方，現在，京滬一千五百多公里長的沿江防衛綫上，除江蘇省方的強力保安團隊外，另外散置的有十幾個軍的兵力，衛戍京滬，在江北當盡力控制橋頭堡，江中有海軍的第二艦隊守防，並且有黃海勃海兩大隊機羣担任空防，江南沿江更有江防監視哨，監視崗，如此江防，雖非天塹，也可說固若金湯。</p>
<p>在江蘇省境，江面比較狹的有儀徵江陰兩處，在儀徵江邊上，發砲要威脅京滬路行車，但迄今國軍仍在堅守儀徵城，共軍已猛攻數次，未獲一逞。江陰方面，月前有共軍十餘隻木船偸渡，已被海軍擊退，惟此二處地形較差，國軍已配備重兵防守，施家橋瓜州可以砲擊鎭江，但駐軍是堅守這些陣地的，瓜州·六圩陣地堅強，防守決無問題。</p>
<p>據統計：蘇北共軍實力連土共在　在四十萬人左中，並積極在鹽埠，和高郵湖，洪澤湖一帶大量普造木槳船，已造好一千八百多只，配備儀器馬達，聲勢浩蕩，似乎要直逼都門，其實是虛張聲勢，實際上，共軍眞正的動向，並沒有在江蘇方面渡江的迹象，這不過是佯攻，呼應牽制，企圖動搖江南的人心而已。</p>

<h3>徐財長昨與平準會商討　安定滬市金融問題　尚未具體決定故暫不透露內容</h3>
<p>財政部長徐堪中央銀行總裁劉攻蕓，於昨日上午繼續在中國銀行有所商談。金銀平準委員會各委員席德懋李道南及央行業務局長林崇墉等，亦均殖民與議。及午始散。會後，與地人員以尚未有具體決定，故均不願有所表示。關於金銀公開市塲之成立，銀幣拋售之技術，及金銀市塲經紀人與該市塲組織等，均為各方熱烈關心之問題。各報記者曾向央行業務局探詢究竟，林氏亦不願有所透露。僅稱拋與不拋，事關其業務，不能奉吿。記者一再詢及黃金旣有配價，銀元似亦應有一價格。林氏答稱不知道。惟據一般推測，央行大量拋售銀幣，當在金銀市塲正式成立之後。蓋市塲之成立，央行對於金銀市價將更容易控制。昨日黃金交易價已跌進配價一成云。</p>
<p>國行昨日仍大量拋售黃金及紗糖等，控制物價漲勢。今日國行為防止生活指數發表前後，物價漲風起見，已決定仍繼續大量拋售。昨日上午十時金銀平準委員會在中國銀行舉行會議，劉攻芸·席德懋·李道南·陳長桐·林崇鏞等均出席參加。席間對上海拋售政策成敗，檢討頗詳。決定本週內繼續運用該項政策，機動性打擊非法投機牟利者，及物價漲風</p>
<h3>銀根走勢恍惚　暗息百元左右</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根，走勢恍惚不定，全視國行是否拋售各物為依歸。銀根初開仍承上週末之緊勢，日拆仍站一百十元至一百卅元。旋各業市塲視貨價盤檔，多為高日拆所引誘，紛紛脫貨求款放息，故頭寸供應漸裕，日拆亦退至八十元至一百元。近午大部頭寸軋齊，國行忽又來拋金，市塲懾於上週之覆轍，不容再陷，吸受不多。惟日拆卻又吿抬頭。至下午二三時許，又高至一百三十元。惟最後知拋售不多，不寸亦有限，而國庫支撥及外埠匯款續有流出，日拆最後又退至九十元一百元關。昨日國家行局以上週末有紗布及食糖之結款，差入達十二追憶元之譜。洋商各行差入七千萬元，大交換各行差入廿億餘元，小交換各行差出卅二億七千餘萬元。</p>
<p>邇來市塲暗息之高，頗堪驚人，平均每日均認為暗息高昂，雖足證明通貨膨脹之現狀，亦足以刺激物價上漲。某銀錢業負責人曾作一精密之統計，以日拆每千元五十元計算，今日拆出一萬元，在五個月以後，連本帶利，可取得一千二百四十萬元。在第一月內，一萬元加上利息，卽可變成四萬元。第二個月內又增加利息，卽可變成十六萬。第三個月內又增加利息，卽可變成六十四萬。第四個月內再增加利息，卽可變成二百五十六萬元。第五個月內再增加利息，卽可變成一千二百四十萬元。此項拆息利率。較之戰前高多。聞金融管理局方面，刻正設法準備制止改善云。</p>
<h3>金商復業登記　公會在趕辦中</h3>
<p>本週內恐不能完成</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金銀公開市塲之組設，照各方面準備之情勢衡度，勢須延至本週末或下週初，方有端倪。金商業同業公會昨仍繼續辦理會員復業登記事宜，各老會員前往索取申請書者已逾六十家，惟尚無塡就送入者。公會方面為作進一步之商討計，擬定於今日下午三時，再度召開理監事會議，以便完成復業前夕應有之準備工作。據公會之某發言人談稱：此次該公會會員復業，按財部命令，係指原有會員而言，故新會員一時尚未考慮接受。照目前各會員申請登記之情形而言，欲求一週內立卽完成復業事宜，恐言之過早。</p>
<p>又金融當局昨對金銀市塲之成立期限，仍望能於本週內實現。惟據吿：此仍須視金業公會準備之程度而定。至於中央銀行是否將以新鑄銀元向市塲拋售，因事關機密，無法作確切之答覆。</p>
<h3>關元折合外幣</h3>
<p>照外匯移轉證計算　國行不另發關元票</p>
<p>海關關稅改征關元事，本市江海關已奉令自昨晨起，開始實行。該關稅務司昨晨曾召集所屬有關各部門負責工人商討執行之技術及手續。據該關負責人吿記者稱：海關方面改征關元之一切準備工作，均已辦妥，物資進口報關時，由海關核定，應繳納之關金數量。然後由進口商直接向中央銀行國庫局收稅處繳款，海關本身仍不直接收稅。預計實施後，關稅收入可望激增。</p>
<p>據中央銀行消息：關於海關征收之關元，其與黃金銀元金圓劵美鈔港幣之折合率，刻已經國行核定，槪按外匯移轉證價格計算。關元一元，規定美鈔四角。美鈔五十元，合黃金一兩。亦卽等於一百廿五元關元，合黃金一兩。國行并不另發關元本票云。</p>
<h3>圈內銀根仍俏　華股一路下瀉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股市況，昨日走勢先平後軟，中間穩勢盤旋。近午圈外利空消息頻傳，人心虛軟，市吿不支。晨初聞銀根初度報松，塲外帖息開八〇元至八五元，央行配價格仍維原盤，生活指數卽將發表，浮多乘廉思進，市勢略高。近午聞央行仍大量拋金，圈外金價慘跌，各業市塲臨收均起回風，而銀根感緊，市勢一路低游，永紗晨間五·六五。開後空起抵補，散多吸收，一度高度至五元七五。證劵幫力售，又挫至五元五七，金融幫紗幫再吸，又升至五元七五，嗣後左右盤旋，未分榮辱。待至十一時半，黃金市價逐步盤挫，瞬息退近三十萬大關，棉紗疾進猛退，抬面掀起軟風，市勢一路下瀉，喊價退至五元四五。低後銀根奇緊，抬面了售仍殷，復小至五元四角，最後以五元二分收盤。</p>
<p>中小型股，初開尚平。開後微見盤高，高後瞬息卽挫，近午均以低價收盤。美亞先開一元六，高至一元六七，低見一元三八，午收一元四三。新光景福勤興中火華瓷等均開後略高，午收低落。其餘均疲，成效卅一億八千五百卅六萬股。</p>
<p>洋股昨日塲內因消息沉悶，市勢見軟。怡紗喊一萬〇九，一萬一千一。亞洲喊一〇五〇元，一〇七〇元，會德豐三二〇〇〇元有出。英聯一萬二千有進。餘股沉寂。</p>
<p>黃金公債交易清稀，多空頗管興趣。行情略升，晨開十七萬五千元，後升至十七萬七八千，午收十八萬，午後仍為一八萬。</p>
<h3>市塲散步　看台客</h3>
<p>央行自信力　愈玩愈堅強　替金債券拉足面子</p>
<p>最近一二週，投機市塲，好像變成了財金當局的繞指柔，要長要短，全由他作主。</p>
<p>大魚吃吃小魚，原是天演之道。市塲上，誰的本鈿大，誰就是勝利者。憑央行的幾架印機，就有取之不竭，用之不盡的無本本鈿，只要他願意，本來何事不可為？</p>
<p>所以，財金當局，新近在市塲上，要別人長，別人就長；要別人短，別人就短，全憑它吩咐。一想到大魚吃小魚之理，倒也毫不奇怪；奇怪的倒是何以過去一籌莫展？眞是智愚之別不成？只有天曉得了。</p>
<p>似乎財金當局，對於控制市塲，也很有自信了。所以做法愈玩愈勇敢。上週盛傳金銀市塲，可於本週復業；雖說傳之稍早些，但確有其事，非特確有其事，當局期望之殷切，且遠較有志於斯的投機朋友為迫切。足見財金當局之自信，也一天強如一天。</p>
<p>但是，照我看來，過去一週的市面呆落，為了月中關係，有其自然趨勢。眞能表演其顏色的，應看今後一週的控制力量。</p>
<p>不談金銀市塲則已，提到就很覺得有不可思議之妙。</p>
<p>大家關心於金銀市塲復業消息的，為着今後的金銀高價，其實還是萬變不離其宗，復業了能使市面平衡，決無其事。看看過去，儘管表演着當局有控制市塲之力，但各物漲度始終和利息看齊，就可以瞭然</p>
<p>金銀商人對准許金銀市塲復業。雖然意興沖沖，但想到證金問題個個躊躇，據說每名要繳百根條子，此數在戰前雖不算大，現在卻不可謂小。而且商民繳實貨給當局充證金，當局對商民能有什麼保證沒有？有人曾主張保證金由市塲負責自行保管，可是市塲當局卻沒有藏金安全地帶，誰都不敢負此責任。</p>
<p>其實，當局殷望金銀早日開市的，別有企圖。因為明知要商人繳實貨證金，是一樁難事，但是他仍想維持每家一百根的標準，以留討價的餘地。將來很可能證金每家百根，堅持不讓步。但繳解實貨的條件，可能改繳金債券。金債券市價比烚赤便宜一半，這個讓步，也無異把證金減了一半。在商人方面，豈不替金債券拉足面子了？</p>
<h3>在國行拋售下　金價近午回小</h3>
<p>黃金昨日市況仍軟，央行贑拋，多頭不勝寒心。初盤開三三三，三三八，繼卽高至三四〇，三四五。嗣後盤旋於三三五左右。近午央行再度拋售，人心奇怯，檯面吐售頻繁，散空跟蹤，市勢掀起回風，一路低至三〇萬邊。低後銀根大緊，暗息做至一二五元一四〇元，浮多不勝負担，檯面斬殺不已，結果仍以二九五〇〇〇元三〇萬午收。後市帶息初開三二五，三三〇，中盤升三三〇左右，三時後升至三三五左右，四時高至三四一。高後新空再起，瞬息又回，仍退至三三五左右，晚收為三三五，三三七了結</p>
<p>美鈔最開為六七〇〇元，六八〇〇元，中間走勢隨黃金漲跌，午收為五九〇〇元，六〇〇〇元，午後開為六五〇〇元，六六〇〇元，嗣後逐盤逐升，高至六八〇〇元後回落至六七〇〇元六七五〇元。</p>
<p>港匯平定</p>
<p>港匯昨日晨開每千元六角九分半，與上週六晚收同價。金圓券昨日晨開每千元一元二角，與上週六晚收同價。</p>
<p>港金昨日晨開三〇四元五角，上週末收盤三〇五元。美金電匯，昨晨開五元二角一分。美鈔昨晨開五元一角七分，上週末收盤五元二角一分。</p>
<h3>銀根緊·去路滯　食米稍見回疲　麵粉下降油市上落不定</h3>
<p>米市路見回跌，因銀根緊俏，貨主售意甚股，因暗息之高昂，米店納胃甚淡，開盤貨主仍欲喊原價，終以去化慓怠而吿挫低，北市塲白粳及薄稻均做三萬六千五百元，較上週六降五百元，特粳仍站三萬九千元。南米市塲粳秈米各低五百元，惟至收市依然呆木，價續喊低，二市到米七三三三石。</p>
<p>食油價格，起伏靡定，因銀根緊，早市卽降，中途一度掙扎扳挺，收市終以業外報跌而下挫，豆油以十四萬二千元開市，中市叵升到十四萬八千元，收市又回低至十四萬三千元，收市又回低至十四萬三千元，軋低四千元，生菜油收市十三萬八千元，下跌五千元，吉桶生油跌九千，蔴油，茶油均跌一萬元，豆餅跌千元。</p>
<p>麵粉在銀根吿緊下，納戶頓稀，價格下降，開市卽有北幫吐售，繼再有廠方開售，老車由一萬五千三百開市，直低至一萬五千一百五十收市，最後更以金價下降而做低至萬五千元，較上週六上午降六百五十元，兵船粉最後一萬四千四百元，紅蜂建成等均降六七百元，麩皮疲乏去路。</p>
<p>雜糧齊趨下游，以銀根緊俏，售多納少，黃豆廠胃及客胃俱保，跌落二千元，生仁降五千，苞米紅糧各跌千元，芝蔴亦以油廠不納，跌落六七千元。</p>
<h3>行荘申請書流通　金管當局將調查</h3>
<p>關於行荘轉賬申請書之流通，日來曾盛極一時。對信用膨脹之影響至大。金融當局有鑒於此，前曾勸導各行荘減少發給，藉免影響市塲，而便利行荘本身業務之進行。茲悉，若干中小行荘，為討好客戶，對此項勸吿，仍多敷衍。金管當局對此，已予密切注意。聞將集中調查，藉以收緊縮信用，安定市塲之實效云。</p>
<h3>國外訂貨進口　較前週減少</h3>
<p>據輸管會息：已付款國外訂貨，本月第一週申請進口共九十件，金額總計四十二萬餘美元，較前週減少三分之一。該項國外訂貨申請進口辦法，迄今已達十八週，共核准進口件數一六六四件，金額總計一，一三八，二三二美元。</p>
<p>茶市堅平</p>
<p>茶市漲風自連綿猛晉後，昨仍倘俐不衰，良以茶存空虛，激動人心，同時繼承上週雖昂未足之潛伏力，故晨初賣戶喊價卽吿奮振，市乃扶搖直上，中途因業中頭寸其緊，趨勢稍形平和，惟行市毫無岌岌可危之象，一致巍站如昔。而查交易，內銷茶除本街店戶尚有添納，餘如蘇錫及鄉郊各地，則受天雨關係，買氣趦趄。至於外銷箱茶，亦以漲率奇速，與國外茶價，漸呈倒懸，求者轉懈，做開甚微。</p>
<p>桐油下挫</p>
<p>接連向高峯邁進之桐油行市，昨開後卽吿面目全非，頻走下坡，緣因在當局拋售物資，抽緊銀根中壓力漸已波及同業，吐售者頓開絡繹，買戶趁機抑價，市乃不支後退。臨收結果，一致較上週軋跌萬元有奇，交易尚稱不寂。</p>
<h3>捲煙皂火平疲</h3>
<p>昨晨捲煙市況，因銀根緊勢未弛，浮多戒懼，賣方略有松脫。惟門荘實銷抵補仍殷，市勢復上盤途。臨收頤中各高檔略吿堅稱，餘均平定。日用品大戶欲抬乏力，各方俱抱觀望，行情平疲。固本五萬五，箭刀五萬，祥茂三萬五千四，美麗火柴二十三萬，鳳凰火柴二十二萬元。</p>
<h3>紗價迂迴挫降　棉布賣風轉劇</h3>
<p>棉紗欲振無力，晨開人心尚堅，各紗高價喊出，繼以市上銀根緊勢未已，且圈外物品均吿平疲，實銷亦呆，塲內交易殊為閒散，貨主咸不主守，紛以脫貨求現為原則，但新買裏足不前，市勢迂迴挫降。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳由二百七十二萬元一路退至二百五十一萬元收市，較週末跌六萬元。一四〇支藍鳳小七萬元，三二支銀月亦挫六萬元，以一百六十四萬元結束。二一支雙馬現貨自一百三十一萬元開出後，曾高見一百三十六萬元，是以散多與粵幫迫於頭寸，不乏套賣，終以一百二十二萬元疲檔收市，軋低五萬元，廠單最後做二百二十一萬五千元。二〇支雙馬微挫二萬元，其餘一六支及一〇支粗紗走勢亦呆，市價跟蹤下降。</p>
<p>布市旋昂卽回，因業內銀根未松，市上交易清淡，本街門荘營業慘落，客幫僅粵漢方面少數搜購，散多受高利壓迫，紛紛脫手，各布高後盤小，結果微見軋高，龍頭細布自四萬九千二百元開出，一度曾喊俏至五萬一千六百元，但未幾卽退入關內，終以四萬八千八百地收市，較上週末挺二千三百元，喇叭童細布好起二千二百元，喇叭童布好起二千二百元，四君子元嗶嘰晨開四萬七千五百元，中途最高達四萬八千五百元，近午散多充斥，賣氣洶湧，市乃急轉下游，最後低至四萬六千四百元結束，軋漲一千五百元。</p>
<p>他若四君子元直貢與姚鯉元光斜等，亦微露秀色，民營廠家開貨大致較週六提高半成左右，一九〇高檔士林叩破十萬元大關。</p>
<h3>絲綢疲軟</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市況劇瀉，市上銀根仍俏，暗息先低後高，人心見軟。一二〇號東洋卽期一七一萬開後檯面拉抬，一度高至一七六萬。待至臨收，聞黃金暴跌，人心虛軟。午收時當日頭寸小至一六二萬，隔日頭寸一七六萬五千元，小十萬元。</p>
<p>生絲晨初因銀根稍寬，外匯證晨開尚高，人心微堅。高級零担，先喊二六五元，午刻圈外金價慘跌，頭寸咸緊，暗息拉高，檯面吐售不絕，市勢回小，終以二五〇萬低盤收市。</p>
<p>綢絲昨市初因銀根稍弛，人心見昂。美亞因檯面籌碼尚少，晨開卽挺，先喊一一八萬五千元，嗣後升起三萬元，午收時又吿回落，終以一一六五千元收市。</p>

<h3>進出口貿易如何合理化　進出口商同業公會　對財金案發表意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自財政金融改革方案公佈後，記者屢訪本市進出口商業同業公會負責人，叩詢意見，昨據發表，對於該方案有關進出口貿易部份之意見如下：</p>
<p>政府公佈財政金融改革方案，已經半月有餘，實施細則，尚未見公布。該項實施細則，係屬推行本方案之具體辦法，各方期待，自極殷切。茲對方案中有關進出口貿易部分，略貢所見，以供當局擬訂該項實施細則，或修正方案之參考。</p>
<p>首先關於該方案在進出口貿易方面，可能收到之效果可分為積極與消極兩方面來說。其在積極方面之效果，當局進出口貿易，可能因而得能靈活運營。卽在該方案實施以後，（一）由於進口限額分配貨品種類之減少。如輸出入管理委員會等寵大機構，卽可因而撤消。且經監院通過咨請政院實行，自可使進口商減少種種申請許可與簽證等迂迴手續，以利進口貿易之進行。並由於簽證手續之免除，得可減少簽證費之支出，以減進口貨品之成本。而對工業街道，尤圖有利。（二）由於中央銀行取消一七〇號外匯通吿之限制，規定外匯移轉證可以自由轉讓，以向國外輸入貨品，將使移轉證價格切近實際情形，對出口貿易方面，可能收得積極效果。而目前進口所需外匯，唯一倚賴輸出外匯，故對於輸出有利者，卽為對輸入之有利因素。</p>
<p>至該方案在進出口貿易方面，可能產生之副作用，亦卽其消極方面之效果，則有下述二項。卽（一）由於海關進口稅之改徴關元，勢將加甚華南方面之走私，且事實上華南走私之新形勢，已在形成過程中。在該方案實施以後，除小數限額禁止，或暫停進口等貨品外，其餘均可自由進口，但以海關進口稅必徴關元之關係，可以自由進口之貨品，亦將為減輕進口成本而採走私方式。又由於華南走私之有加劇趨勢，該方案所預期之財政目的，希以改徴關元而增財政收入，亦必因正式進口之減少，難以達成。何況華中經濟情形僵化，進口決難增加。（二）由於進口之開放，對於國內各種關係工業之生產，可能使受不利影響。但此缺點，可能以彌補。卽就大體言，將來之進口貨品，可能分為（甲）准許自由進口之貨品，（乙）暫時不准進口之貨品，及（丙）禁止進口之貨品。為求彌補上項缺點，准許自由進口之貨品，望能稍予嚴格。而暫時不准進口之貨品，則望多列一些，以收保護之效。</p>
<p>最後關於該方案進出口貿易部份，列舉糧食·棉花及肥料，由政府另行規定辦法辦理，深望最近期內，能有詳盡而較合理之辦法公布。並望准許利用自由資金進口。至於紗布之出口，亦望得能放寬限制，如花紗布外銷委員會及美援花紗布聯合購銷處等駢支機構，更望予以撤銷。此外在輸出入管理委員會等龐大機構撤消以後，希望能有統籌進出口貿易決策之合理機構產生，並容納工商界人士參加。</p>

<h3>今晚籃球精彩　仁餘重逢恩卡斯　海靑再戰培斐爾</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽今晚有精彩戰，已昇列聯賽第二位之仁餘隊，將與恩卡斯狹路重逢，此戰勝負，與仁餘前途影響至鉅。仁餘球藝，竿頭直上，恩卡斯在第二循環中，亦大為進步，無疑將為一塲精彩好戲。另甲一組一塲，培斐爾與海靑，兩美軍作關墻之爭。甲二A組開塲戲，為影星又一隊對懋勛。門劵價目照舊，秩序列下：</p>
<p>又一—懋勛（甲二A）　五時半</p>
<p>培斐爾—海靑（甲一組）　六時半</p>
<p>仁餘—恩卡斯（甲一組）　七時半</p>
<p>壓軸大戰仁餘重逢恩卡斯按甲一組華人與西人各四隊，最近華隊中，除華聯僅一度遇挫最具冠軍希望外，回力及滬警均四次敗北，與恩卡斯並列，至仁餘則入戰六勝二負，聲勢殊壯，今晚獲勝，第二位固為磐石，否則恩卡斯將越回力滬警直逼前來也。仁餘在本屆戰績輝煌，蓋得自合宿訓練及教練之指導，徐仲已海外歸來，蔡金典參加助陳，實力充實而球藝亦竿頭日上，恩卡斯原屬滬上西人隊中之巨擘，但初循戰果，勝負參半，第二循環中奮發有為，回力滬警先後遭其毒手，宿仇獲償，該隊主持恩格尼雖離滬，但得美氣象隊長泊授昇格加入助戰，泊透剽悍異常，在勃脫朋乞谷夫間，如虎添翼，令人生畏懼，仁餘初循中受辱，忍受迄今，此番冤家狹路，豈肯，況關係前途，兩路英雄各展身手，誓死一拼，且看究屬誰勝誰負。</p>
<p>開鑼戲又一對懋勛，後者勝劵可操，蓋又一係電影明星組成，廻光燈下不比水銀燈下，師出以還，兩戰兩北，今晚又逢該組常勝懋勛擁有卓觀政孫家雯等好手，其餘諸將亦皆驍勇善戰，惟兵家忌驕，懋勛不國敵，三造勝利固意中事也。</p>
<p>次仗培斐爾再戰海靑，兩隊初遇，斐隊曾以四二比四三一分飲恨，此番報仇機會已到，必出全力從事，該隊於初循中從未獲勝，但進入第二循環後，形勢大變，克華聯，破麥令斯，兩復前仇，球亦愈打愈好，麾下克勒格萊奇伊卡特演出卯上，而黑炭勃朗投籃必中，尤為危險人物，海靑前番倖勝，此戰當謀再挫勁敵，以維令譽，但二循中該隊已三次失利，士氣受此刺激，奮發作戰，則今晚血戰難免。</p>
<p>（又一）蘇石風，羅仲洲，韓非，石揮，金燄，凌之浩，張伐，衛禹平，賀路，王學武。</p>
<p>（懋勛）孫家雯，楊繼震，王恭森，劉昭仁，卓觀政，朱履　，陳侃，陳頌義，陳鴻誼，朱劍雄。</p>

<h3>運動世界　籃球聯賽甲一組　四華隊仍列前茅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽甲一組，華人四隊仍列前茅，番軍四隊追隨於後。華聯雖遭一敗，依然領導羣雄。仁餘已昇列第二位。因卡斯在第二循環中，接連勝利，滬警則不甚順利，因此回力滬警恩卡斯已並第三，各為五勝四負。麥令斯海靑一塲進步一塲，第二循環之結果如何，尚在不可知之數。各隊勝負形勢，列表如下：</p>

<h3>台省橄欖球賽　廿五日起舉行</h3>
<p>〔台北航訊〕台省橄欖球協會為提倡橄欖運動及喚起省民運動興趣起見，定於本月二十五二十七二日舉行本年度第三屆全省橄欖球比賽，據悉：凡有組織之球隊均可參加，並劃分社會組及中學組二種，屆時將在本市台北公園球塲舉行。</p>
<h3>英式足球在美發展</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十一日訊〕據美國足球協會之代言人巴里斯基爾談：足球運動，近來在美國頗興盛，本年夏季將有英國職業足球隊來英國參加比賽。美國軍人在英倫，蘇格蘭，及北愛爾蘭停留期間，當與當地英足球隊比賽，獲得良好經騐。彼等回國時，則已成為良好之足球員，現在美國加入足球總會之球員有五萬以上，紐約每屆星期六看足球者有四萬餘人，由上年九月至本年六月期間。美國參加足球比賽之球隊有二百隊之多，足球之一項運動，在美國前途大有發展云。</p>

<h3>英國的體育着重生意眼</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處訊〕運動方面對於一九四九年的英國經濟，將會有很大的貢獻，英國的許多工廠現在正在製造許多種優良的運動器具，而其中僅只三分之一是供給國內的需要的。這個數量雖然已較一年以前的國內供應比率增加了許多，然而和二次大戰以前的國內需要量相比還是相差很遠。不過供求量的平衡是逐漸發展的。目下織物和皮革在國內市塲上仍歸是奇貨而不易購得，因為這些貨物的大部分是完全用在出口方面了。</p>
<p>英國賽馬的習慣也可以算是一種出口事業，國外的飼馬人對於英國馬種的器重是有增無已，這一點我們從各方面對於純血種的需要上就可以看得出來，自從戰爭結束以來，這方面的需要非獨沒有減少而正在增長中，英國賽馬名將羅士班萊深信這需要是不會減退的，他對於英國馬種的純良是堅信不移的，他的意見已給予飼馬的人一種增加輸出的新鼓勵。</p>
<p>英國的體育精神也是一種主要的「出口物資」，我們從去年夏天倫敦的世運會裏就可以明白地看得出來了，世運會裏的每一個節目對於來自海外的觀眾有着強大的吸引力，像大學划艇比賽，英格蘭蘇格蘭足球賽，在溫布萊塲舉行的網球賽和外塲高而夫球聯賽等，在去年都曾使成千成萬的旅英人士着了迷，這許多運動節目構成了一幅使人不能忘懷的英國風情畫，今年的運動季節又要來了，那些今年再來觀光的人，又可以賞覽一番了。</p>
<p>許多的國外旅客就要來英國作首度的暢遊了，他們將可以參觀五月裏在倫敦和伯明翰舉行的英國工業展覽會，在去年的展覽會裏，運動器具佔着一個重要而頗令人注目的部分，其中有許多展覽品是二次大戰以後英國商店裏所不曾見過的，這些東西製造得精緻動人，但完全是運銷外國的，英國國內愛好運動的人士在幾個月以後才能夠買得到。這就是英國為增加輸出而自我犧牲的一部分，曾經有一位體育用具商，他在參觀了去年的展覽會以後，就吿訴我說，當他看到這許多重要的用具全數用以出口而不在國內出售的時候，他欣羨與垂涎的程度是不可言喻的，英國製造商造成的用具眞是五花八門，包羅萬象，使國內的觀眾們頗有些應接不暇之感，運動衣鞋之類也顯得應有盡有完備無缺，在今年的展覽會中當然不會兩樣，不過其中新奇的樣品將會更多，某些部門的備貨將更見充足，以供人選擇。各種貨色的品質是最重要了，英國的國內市塲雖將因為增產的結果而獲益，然而外國的商人將獲得品質最好的東西，他們將可以見到最上等的品質，構造的精良和經久耐用是不必多講的。</p>
<p>體育活動方面也將會使海外來英人士看得目不暇接，倫敦的足球賽將會盛大地舉行，以歡娛來英與會的人士。每塲的觀眾據估計都將達到九萬的數目，其他如板球等的活動也將風行全英，所以五月裏到英國來遊覽的人可以不愁沒有球賽看的了。（匹金敦著）</p>
<h3>香港足球經　中華巴士將爭奪亞軍</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕上週末香港甲組足球聯賽，共有六塲，結果是：</p>
<p>南華南勝海軍隊　八比〇</p>
<p>東方會勝南華華　五比二</p>
<p>陸軍隊勝空軍隊　一比〇</p>
<p>中華會勝傑志會　三比二</p>
<p>巴士隊勝香港會　三比二</p>
<p>聖約瑟勝警察隊　五比二</p>
<p>話說南南第十六次出師，雄風依然，水兵不濟事，浄收鴨蛋八隻，戰情毫無緊張鏡頭，演出輕松，不但看的人笑口常開，踢的人也一樣越踢越開心，可說是一幕游龍戲鳳的好戲，不是南南踢得好，卻是海軍演出特別壞，南南的前鋒踢出八個人，海軍後衛怎能應付，一條白界綫劃成兩個戰塲，這邊廂，「靚德」門前車馬稀，七十分鍾的球賽正式接球的不過五只，錦洪守着中路，大有當年翼德守長板橋的雄風，水兵總無法開入，侯子，樹陵守着兩個橋頭堡，形同鐵壁，讓劉松常作跑馬射金錢之壯舉，那邊廂，培烈脫手忙脚亂，干華利，多沙生意忙碌，上半塲還有招架之工，只負兩只，下半塲全軍盡墨，連進雞蛋半打，看得座上客笑口迷迷。</p>

<p>梁榮光　李殿祺　李惠林　劉福銓　李洪祺</p>
<p>星期日兩大重頭戲，巴士勝了香港會，中華倖敗了傑志會，比數同為三比二，聯賽亞軍之爭奪仍是並轡齊進，究竟誰屬尚待下週再分上下，到今為止，中華的積分多巴士四分，但失分卻相等，巴士少踢兩仗而已。</p>
<p>中華會以三比二擊敗了傑志，從過程而言，中華贏得僥倖，因為中華的三球中，最低限度有兩球是傑志的內衛奉送的。上半時的第二隻，莫錦松未曾看清楚有兩個中華前鋒同時在他的身邊，卻把球輕輕地頂進自己的門內，出張觀興的意料之外，下半時，盧華勝之單刀又是游華興興李炳照相互間的錯誤所造成。</p>
<p>然而中華的士氣如虹，傑志缺了姚卓然，也是此勝彼敗的主因</p>

<h3>理髪有感</h3>
<p>— 馬丁</p>
<p>自從理髮一次，過千圓大關以後，摸摸口袋，常不敢踏進理髪店的門。如此拖延了好幾個禮拜，到昨天，實在是頭髮長得太不成樣了，乃不得不走了進去。好在男人怕理髪，本是名正言訓之事，並不一定都是為了化不起錢；所以我帶着這一頭長髮坐到理髪椅上去時，倒也並無愧色。</p>
<p>旣坐了上去，被四周嗡嗡的電吹風的聲昔所催眠，閉上眼睛，不免胡思亂想起來：</p>
<p>理髪這個職業，向來是頗為人羨慕的，因為夏天有風扇，冬天生火爐，絕無烈日炙膚或雨打風吹之苦。而且，兩手還得一親漂亮女郎的嫩面粉頸，而對方絕不動氣，此猶其餘事。但我覺得理髪師地位之尊嚴，還不在這個上；而是當你躺下身來，讓他磨刀霍霍，為你修面剃鬚之時，你的生殺予奪之權繫於其一念之間的這種情緒上。我常想，這位理髮師如果神經略有毛病，偶一錯亂，一刀割下喉管，豈不就完蛋了？此等事雖不常有，但自己的性命只繫於其一念之間，終究是很危險的。我不知如希特勒輩之防人暗殺，處處嚴密戒備，偵探密佈，但於這理髪一事，將如何辦法；想來其御用理髪師，必是十分心腹的，或是其妻弟，一未可知。在中國史上，理髮師之操生殺予奪之權，確也曾有過的。遠的不說，近如滿淸入關之時，為了强迫人們薙長髮，改胡裝，曾封理髮師為「待詔」之宮，到街上看見蓄長髮的遣老遣少，即可强迫剃之，否則呢？「留頭不留髪，留髮不留頭」。其威風之盛，是可以想見的。</p>
<p>卽如在外國，雖未聞有奉旨殺人頭之事，但理髮師當初多兼任外科醫生，這是有據可考的。現在理髮店門口那個轉動的紅藍兩色圓柱，據說起源於歡洲，好像是意大利吧，因手頭無書，不能查考。總之，那時一般人相信，若有毛病，只要割開一根血管，放一點血，毒出了，病就好了；意思和今日中國鄉下老百姓發痧，只要叫人在項頸裏刮成一條條紅痕就會好的一樣。而在意大利，這割血管的工作，就是由理髮師兼任的。圓柱子上的紅藍條子，紅卽代表動脈，藍則代表靜脈云云。旣可割開血管，則豈不能割斷喉頭？想至此，就不免令人毛骨悚然了。</p>
<p>所以我對於那些肯常進理髮店去的人，是很佩服其胆量的。從前淸代判獄，大盜斬決，對於從犯，常有陪斬之舉，就是把他一起綁到刑塲，事先並不通知，親見旁邊的人被砍下頭來，而自己却仍被帶回。以此作為警戒，據說是甚有奇效的。則今日的躺在理髮椅上，眼見亮晃晃冷冰冰的剃刀在自己喉頭刮來刮去，豈不時時感覺有被謀殺的危險；而竟敢樂此不疲，常去受殺，其胆識怎不叫人佩服之至呢？</p>
<p>理髮師雖手掌生殺之權，但有一點畢竟是餘憾得很的。就是：他自己的頭，也不免要交到別的人手裏去剃。裁縫可以巷自己做衣裳，漆匠可以替自己粉刷房子，惟有理髮師，則不能自己動手，仍非請敎別的理髪師不可。由此也悟到，凡人之掌握他人性命者，自己的性命也常常握在他人之手，所謂螳螂捕蟬，黃雀在後也。世事循環，大都如此，「請看剃頭者，人亦剃其頭」！</p>
<p>想至此，自己髮已理畢，立起身來，雖付了一千七百塊錢，但覺得己悟出了一個大道理，深感此行不虛，也就心中釋然了。</p>
<h3>人身改造議</h3>
<p>— 王德雲</p>
<p>現在一般窮公敎人員和小職員等，大概都不是所謂「適者」罷，因此簡直很難「生存」下去。為了「適應環境」，不被社會所淘汰，似大有「改造」一下的必要。</p>
<p>當然，窮小子的腦是無法「改造」的，這或許是「天生低能」，所以是應母庸議，不提也罷。目前急需「改造」的，便是人體的眼，口，胃和腿。因為這實與生活大有關係，非同小可。如果科學家能替哀哀小民動出「改造」腦筋，則實在是不勝感激涕零之至的。茲姑將鄙見錄下，備作參考，幸希垂鑒：</p>
<p>（一）眼的改造——最好能改造成貓似的眼，晚上不用點燈，也能明察秋毫，庶幾可省却一筆電費。本來，窮人也竟要事受電燈設備，原是太奢侈了。</p>
<p>（二）目的改造——最好改成管子形，且有沙瀘及殺菌功能，則隨時隨地皆可覓得飲料，卽使常喝點蘇州河裏的黑水，也不妨了。——自來水貴麼？也儘可不理他。</p>
<p>（三）胃的改造——最好改良得不用吃人間烟火食，祗要吸點空氣，就能活命，這一點當然很難，但也要拜託科學家先生。</p>
<p>（四）腿的改造——最好改良得比沙漢上鴕鳥的腿更結實，跑上幾百里而能毫不在乎，則豈不大佳？那末，電車讓他關元算也好，美金算也好，都可不干我事。</p>
<p>以上「改造」四點，實係「當前急務」，比甚麼新的財政經濟方策都重要。但願科學家先生們，羣起埋頭研究，設法改良成功，則小民幸甚。</p>

<h3>不幸之至</h3>
<p>一個人跌在江裏，被浪冲走了，鄰人去吿訴他的太太，覺得很為雞：</p>
<p>「太太，我帶給你一個很不幸的消息。你的丈夫淹死了。」</p>
<p>「啊，什麼！他的新派克五十一也放在袋裏呀！」</p>
<h3>馴蛇專家</h3>
<p>— 張洪祥</p>
<p>威萊夫人是美國康薩斯州人，她是一個黑頭髮，藍眼球，身材瘦小，態度溫和而有禮的中年婦人。她的談話中時常夾着許多科學術語，同時又將那些殺人魔王——毒蛇稱為她的「小寳貝」。廿三年，她馴服了二條擁有蛇王名稱的眼鏡蛇，除此以外，還有一條響尾蛇，一條竹靑蛇，一條小眼鏡蛇，三條銅頭蛇，幾條大蟒蛇，以及一百多條都是極毒的毒蛇。威萊夫人在十多歲的時候，就開始閱讀關於飛蛾蝴蝶的書本，一面讀書，一面收集標本。長大以後，她在康薩斯大學攻讀蟲類學，同時就決定了要研究蟲類動物。一九二二年，她在大學畢業以後，拿一百塊錢，到坦薩克斯州去收集標本，但是結果是帶回了六十五條響尾蛇到大學的博物館去。後來，她在敏尼波利斯自然博物館裏工作了十五年。一九三八年，她自動辭職，決定到好萊塢去創辦一家規模最大的私人動物園。威萊夫人現在的收入，就是租蛇給影片公司，並且時常舉行賣票的公開展覽。</p>
<p>威萊夫人發覺好萊塢缺乏弄蛇的人才，所以有時候除了出租毒蛇以外，她還不得不在影片中扮演弄蛇者。有一次，影片中需要一條白色的眼鏡蛇，但威萊夫人所有的蛇都不是白色的，所以她又不得不親自動手，在蛇的身上塗上一層白漆。當她馴服那二條大眼鏡蛇的時候，她曾將一切經過都記在日記本上。八月廿六日，她收到從星加坡運來的那二條「蛇王」，牠們起初火氣甚大，口裏噝噝發聲，可以跳得三呎高，凡是牠們能够觸到的東西，都要亂咬亂纏。八月三十日以後的四天中，她的日記本子上寫着：「今天我第一次用一條十八吋長的橡皮棍子馴服了牠們。」第三天，寫着：「用我的空手去捉眼鏡蛇的尾巴。」</p>
<p>九月四日，記着：「今天我用空手去捉住那條雌的蛇后，撐開牠的嘴吧，用手指挾東西給牠吃。」</p>
<p>九月六日：「二條毒蛇都馴服了，我己可以指揮牠們的行動。」</p>
<p>兩個月以後，她的日記本子上這樣寫着：「這也是一件很希奇的事！以我的經騐而說，世界上最毒，最危險的蛇，却是最容易馴服的蛇。」</p>
<p>威萊夫人確是一個馴蛇專家，她知道蛇的性情，需要和反應。雖然她是如此精細，可是也曾被毒蛇咬傷過幾次，但是每一次她總是歸罪於自己，因為她破壞了她自己神聖的規則。</p>
<p>這一條神聖而寳貴的規則，表面上好似極普通極平凡的，乃是：「安靜，鎭定，切勿疏忽，大胆而精細。要是發生了意外的不幸事情，則立刻僵立不動，或者作迅速的撤退。」</p>
<h3>夫婦間可以完全　沒有虛僞嗎？</h3>
<p>— 寶珠</p>
<p>夫婦之間要眞誠相待，公開坦白，這是大經地義，古今中外都認為應該的。可是太直率，太坦白，絲奄沒有虛偽，行得通嗎？事實吿訴我們是個「不」。這裏有兩個故事，雖像笑話，却是常能發生的事實：</p>
<p>有夫婦兩人覺得社會上人與人之間，都是虛偽的，卽是最要好的朋友，也不够坦白，但是夫妻之間總應該沒有這個「假」字，所以兩人決定以後無論何事，大家要坦白相吿。有一天，丈夫請他太太親自燒一塊牛排給他吃，太太不善於烹飪，但很高興地費了許多時間，為她丈夫做了一塊牛排。丈夫見了也很感激，但切了半天，用盡九牛二虎之力，才切下一小塊。拿起來一嘗，鹹得簡直發苦了，於是他想起應該老實吿訴他太太：「你這塊牛排實在燒得太壞了，又硬又鹹，簡直像鹽缸裏撈出來的石槐。』這位太太一聽，立刻扳起了臉，搶了他的盤子往廚房裏一擲，嘴裏還咕着：「本來沒有人高興燒給你吃，你要吃好的，為什麼不上大菜館去？』</p>
<p>另外一對新婚夫婦，也是贊成要互相說實話的。先生愛好作畫，所以就在業餘去習畫。過了不久，他拿了一張人像回來給他太太看，並笑容滿面地說：「你看看我的得意傑作怎末樣？」太太一看，璞嗤笑了出來：「這算什麼，旣不像人，又不像鬼，倒像隻猴子。」先生很不高興，過了一會還是不樂意：「你根本不懂得藝術，學校裏的敎授還說我實得不錯吶！」「我是不懂藝術的，配不上你，」太太連忙搶上來：「你為什麼不去娶個懂藝術的？」結果，兩人吵了一個下午，太太一氣回娘家，住了一個星期才給家人勸回來。</p>
<p>我當然不主張夫婦要勉强敷衍，過於敷衍虛偽，就沒有眞正的感情。同時，拼命要學歐美人老是讚美他的丈夫或妻子，在我們也是不習慣的。譬如說：喬治的太太一天買了件大紅的衣服穿回家給他看，這位先生一見了，就露出非常驚喜的樣子說：「GE　！親愛的！你穿了這件衣服眞太美了，好萊塢最美麗的女明星，也及不到你」，其實這位太太至少也有一百八十磅。</p>
<p>在某一些地方，某一種情緒之下，妻子或丈夫稍些帶一點「假」意，是祗會增加感情，而沒有損害的。至少沒有一個妻子因為臉上胭脂搽得太紅一點，而願意她丈夫叫她妖怪的；也沒有一個丈夫因為好幾天沒有剃鬍子，而願意他太太說他像犯人的。</p>
<p>為什麼連夫婦間也要帶一點虛偽呢？這個理由是很簡單的：因為每個人生來都有自尊心，愛美心，好勝心，和喜歡受人讀美的心。這些天性，決不能因為夫婦·愛人·知己·甚至父母子女的關係而消滅的。</p>

<h3>Preliminary Negotiations in Shanghai Concluded; President He Scheduled to Go to the Capital This Morning; Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, and Zhang Junmai All Decline Cabinet Positions; Youth Party Agrees in Principle to Participate</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] President He Yingqin's preliminary cabinet formation work in Shanghai has come to an end. The Youth Party, in principle, does not oppose participating in the new cabinet, but still needs to make a decision at an internal party meeting; Zhang Junmai has declined to participate, stating that the People's Socialist Party will support the new cabinet in the capacity of an opposition party. In addition, Zhang Shizhao is still considering, while Yan Huiqing and Jiang Yong have both expressed their unwillingness to participate due to old age and health reasons. President He concluded his public duties in Shanghai and was originally scheduled to take the 11 o'clock express train to the capital last night. The railway bureau had prepared a special car, but he temporarily decided to postpone it and will depart at 7:00 this morning. After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, He personally visited Zhang Junmai at 7:00 p.m. that evening, inviting him to participate in the new cabinet. Zhang politely declined, saying that the People's Socialist Party was willing to assist the new cabinet as an opposition party. At 9:00 p.m., he went to Zuo's residence on Difeng Road to consult with the leaders of the Youth Party. Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, Xie Chengping, and Lin Keji were all present. The consultation lasted for more than an hour before he left. Yesterday morning, Yan Huiqing and Chen Guangfu visited one after another, and did not leave until 11:00 a.m. President He then drove to visit Jiang Yong and Zhang Shizhao, earnestly inviting them to participate in the new cabinet. At that time, Jiang Yong stated that his purpose in going to Beiping was to strive for peace for all the people. If he were to participate in the government now, it would invite criticism and cause many inconveniences, which he hoped He would understand. Zhang Shizhao is still considering. Around 1:00 p.m. in the afternoon, Mayor Wu and Duanmu Kai and others visited one after another, but President He was out and had not returned, so they did not meet. Around 2:00 p.m., Finance Minister Xu Kan was summoned to visit and had a long talk for several hours. According to President He's public statement: in addition to the peace talks, the most difficult problem for the new cabinet is the economic and financial situation.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] The new Premier He Yingqin will arrive in Beijing from Shanghai by special train at 12:00 noon on the 15th. Political figures in the capital and members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans who are currently meeting are eagerly awaiting He's arrival in Beijing, and especially hope that he can form a new cabinet quickly with an innovative style. It is learned that He's list of candidates for the new cabinet has been largely finalized after inviting and consulting with people from all walks of life in Shanghai, and only needs to be decided after returning to the capital and consulting with Acting President Li.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] More than 100 legislators held a forum on the 14th to exchange opinions freely. Some people suggested that the new premier should be notified to submit a list of cabinet members as soon as possible. The current situation is serious and cannot be delayed. It would be best to ask President He to submit a policy report at the Friday meeting of the five Yuans next week.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Simplify Administrative Agencies; Legislative Yuan to Discuss Today; Proposal to Suspend Application of the Suppression of Rebellion Act Also on the Agenda; Peace Proposal to Be Re-Voted</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] The proposal to simplify administrative agencies and amend the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan, which has been passed by the review committee of the Legislative Yuan, has been included in the agenda of the fifth plenary meeting of the third session on the 15th. If this proposal is passed soon, it may affect the upcoming He Yingqin's new cabinet. However, given the enthusiastic discussions during the previous plenary meeting and the review committee, submitting it to the plenary meeting may still lead to fierce debate. In addition, the items for discussion on the agenda of the Yuan meeting on the 15th also include the re-voting on the peace proposal, the proposal to abolish the regulations on special criminal courts, the proposal to suspend the application of the Temporary Provisions for the Period of Suppression of Rebellion, the proposal to adjust the salaries of public educators, and the proposal to launch gold-priced deposits.</p>
<h3>President Chiang Still in Xikou</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Ningbo on the 14th] Foreign news reports that President Chiang has left his hometown of Xikou and moved to Gulangyu, Xiamen, have now been proven to be completely untrue. The President once came to Ningbo for sightseeing, and the rumors may have originated from this.</p>
<h3>Legislators Propose to Launch "Gold-Priced Deposits"</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] Legislators Huang Tong and 35 others proposed to launch gold-priced deposits to stabilize finance, improve salary payment methods, protect savings, and unite the hearts of the military and civilians. They listed the following five measures: (1) Launch "gold-priced deposits," ordering people to deposit gold yuan into national banks, convert them into cash at the price of gold and silver at the time of deposit (the listed price must be consistent with the market price), allow them to withdraw them regularly or at any time, pay them in gold yuan converted at the listed price of gold and silver at the time of withdrawal, and pay interest accordingly. If there is a need to withdraw cash, cash will still be paid. Deposits will not be refused for small amounts or small depositors. (2) The salaries and incomes of public educators and soldiers will be based on the pre-war salary and rank, in addition to paying sufficient gold yuan according to the current cost of living index, and allocating some cash, the remainder will be listed and recorded as long-term deposits with preferential interest. If there are weddings, funerals, or other important needs, temporary withdrawals will be allowed. (3) Military personnel will be handled in the same way as public educators, but for lower-ranking soldiers, a separate method of transferring and storing funds for their family members in their native place will be established. In addition to giving them the amount sufficient for current living expenses, the remainder will be transferred monthly to their direct relatives in their native place or the person they entrust to store and withdraw, or they can withdraw it themselves after retirement. This deposit will be handled properly by the county government in their native place according to the troop transfer documents in the conscription register. (4) For ordinary farmers, businessmen, people, and industrialists, policies such as using checks, treasury bills, and public bonds to regulate finance, absorb currency, develop production, and increase tax revenue, and use "gold-priced deposits" as the basis for consolidating credit and stabilizing the economy. (5) The government will allocate sufficient gold and silver and materials to establish a deposit fund management committee under the full supervision of the people, and use diplomacy to obtain economic loans to strengthen credit.</p>
<h3>Joint Symposium to Be Held by Legislative and Supervisory Yuan Members</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] Members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans meeting in Beijing will hold a joint symposium on the 20th. It was decided on the 14th by the Legislative Yuan's symposium to contact the members of the Supervisory Yuan and make preparations. The deliberation of the joint meeting of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members has been going on for a long time. It is generally believed that the current situation is serious and there are many problems to be resolved. It is necessary for the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans to be connected and exert their strength.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li Orders Taiwan Provincial Government; Military Orders Shall All Be Under Chen Cheng's Command</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Taipei on the 14th] The Presidential Office recently ordered the Taiwan Provincial Government that, from today onwards, all central military organs and troops in Taiwan shall be under the unified command of Chairman and Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng.</p>
<h3>Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Charges Collected at New Prices; Legislators Express Outrage; More Than 100 Propose Effective Prohibition</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] Railways, postal services, and telecommunications increased their prices again on the 11th. On the same day, the Legislative Yuan resolved to ask the Executive Yuan to prohibit it and not recognize the new prices. However, although the case was resolved and notified to the Executive Yuan, postal bureaus, telecommunications bureaus, and railway bureaus have not received orders for days and still charge at the new prices. Most legislators expressed extreme indignation at this, believing that the Executive Yuan's failure to implement the Legislative Yuan's resolutions has damaged the Legislative Yuan's credibility. More than 100 members, including Niu Jianchu, decided to submit an urgent motion, "The Executive Yuan has not yet implemented the prohibition of price increases in the transportation industry, and it is proposed to take effective measures," which will be discussed at the Yuan meeting on the morning of the 15th. The reasons stated in the motion point out that the Executive Yuan has not yet implemented the prohibition of price increases, and the recent soaring prices are caused by its stimulus. Effective measures should be discussed again to maintain the credibility of the Yuan and alleviate the burden on the people. The original motion included two measures: (1) Immediately notify the Minister of Communications by telephone to come to the Yuan to report the reasons why Zhu has not implemented the Yuan's resolution to prohibit price increases. (2) Consult the Executive Yuan again to immediately revoke the newly announced train, postal, and telecommunications prices in the transportation sector. When the Legislative Yuan's plenary symposium was held on the afternoon of the 14th, Zhang Qingzhen also raised this matter orally. The emotions of the members were extremely excited, advocating for severe questioning. However, since the Minister and Deputy Minister of Transportation are currently not in Beijing, it was decided to ask Secretary-General Chen Kewen to telegraph the Minister or Deputy Minister of Transportation in the name of the Legislative Yuan to fly to Beijing immediately to attend the Yuan meeting on the 18th to explain the reasons and be prepared for questioning.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Retreat from Luoshan; Flee Back to the North Bank of the Huai River; Communist Intelligence Agents Cross the River South to Conduct Activities</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Xinyang on the 14th] Military news: (1) There were still minor contacts in the counties of Luoshan and Zhengyang this morning. A group of communist troops that retreated from Bali Store in northeastern Luoshan has fled back to the north bank of the Huai River. A group of more than 800 people is still wandering in Wanjiagang, 15 li from the county. (2) More than 2,000 communist troops continued to arrive in Runan on the 12th, heading south along the eastern side of the Pinghan Railway. More than 10,000 communist troops who had crossed the Zi River and advanced south were still stationed in Chendian, 25 li south of Huangchuan yesterday. The movements of this unit will be clear in the coming days.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 14th] The Communist troops in northern Jiangsu recently dispatched intelligence personnel to cross the Yangtze River south to carry out all underground activities.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Subcommittee Drafts Outline for Political Reform</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] The drafting committee of the Legislative Yuan's outline for political reform held its fourth meeting at 9:30 a.m. on the 14th. Chairman Zou Shuwen and the committee members continued to speak on the issue of political reform. Finally, it was decided that Zou Shuwen and eight others who were previously appointed would organize their opinions, and Yuan Qixun would be the chief drafter to draft the outline for political reform and submit it to the next Yuan meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>Fang further demanded that the customs regulations on the Sino-Soviet border must be completely suspended in the future. If our side agrees to this request, the Soviet side can avoid our customs inspection and transport various non-standard goods into Xinjiang. In the mining sector, the Soviet side proposed that China and the Soviet Union jointly form a mining company, each contributing half of the capital, to exploit "precious and non-ferrous metals" in Xinjiang, and not allow other countries to intervene. Our side does not oppose the joint development of Xinjiang's resources by China and the Soviet Union, but insists on its own position, demanding that the names and types of metals to be mined be detailed in the agreement. The Soviet side firmly refused this, and negotiations stalled. According to geologists' research, there may be uranium mines in Xinjiang, so our side will not make concessions in order to maintain national sovereignty. At the same time, in the Soviet draft agreement, it was requested that the agreement be valid for 50 years and stipulated that mineral products that cannot be used in Xinjiang itself can be exported to the Soviet Union. If our side agrees to this clause, once uranium mines are discovered, they can be sold to the Soviet Union because they cannot be used in Xinjiang. Our side, on the other hand, proposed that the agreement be valid for a maximum of five to fifteen years.</p>
<h3>US State Department Drafting Report on Aid to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Democratic Senator George announced today that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has requested Secretary of State Acheson to submit a report stating his views on the new bill for $1.5 billion in military and economic aid to China proposed by Senator McMillan and 54 others. The State Department is currently drafting the report, which may explain the future US policy towards China.</p>
<h3>Sino-Soviet Negotiations Stalled; Soviet Side Seeking Uranium Mines Needed for Atomic Energy; Our Side Refuses to Concede in Order to Maintain National Sovereignty</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to authoritative sources, the Sino-Soviet trade negotiations that began in January of this year have now stalled. According to the content of this agreement, the Soviet Union would be allowed various privileges in Xinjiang, including commercial aviation and mining, and would have the opportunity to explore uranium mines needed to manufacture atomic energy. Moscow made this request as early as two years ago when Wang Zhaojie presided over diplomacy. At that time, our country did not consider it, and the Soviet side, seeing that the environment was not yet ripe, did not continue to make requests. Recently, the situation has changed drastically, and the pro-Soviet atmosphere within the government has become stronger. The Soviet side revived the old matter, which shows the Soviet Union's diplomatic mobility and pragmatism. The deadlock in the Sino-Soviet trade negotiations is due to two reasons: in terms of trade, the Soviet side requested that, in addition to the official barter trade, it be allowed to trade with private individuals and private companies in Xinjiang. Our side can still consider this point, but the Soviet</p>
<h3>Zhang Fakui Arrives in Guangzhou; Liu Zhi Leaves Hangzhou and Returns to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Guangzhou on the 14th] Commander-in-Chief of the Army Zhang Fakui arrived in Guangzhou from Shaozhou on the 14th and will fly to Beijing for official business in the coming days. It is reported that since Zhang took over as Commander-in-Chief, the original eight departments have been reduced to six departments, and the surplus personnel have been transferred to serve in various pacification offices. The Chief of Staff of the department is still Wang Boshen.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Hangzhou on the 14th] General Liu Zhi left for Shanghai by car at 8:00 a.m. on the 14th to return to Beijing.</p>

<p>(Reports on a city before and after "Local Peace")</p>
<p>(II) Communist Troops Enter Beiping City</p>
<p>After the main points of the Beiping local peace plan were announced, the troops stationed in the city immediately began to move out of the city. The first batch of troops leaving the city came into contact with the communist troops at any time because the communist troops did not withdraw 30 li in accordance with the agreement. Moreover, a small number of communist troops were "shouting" to the soldiers leaving the city, calling on them to join the People's Liberation Army. This aroused the anger of the troop leaders and soldiers, and they fought each other. After two full hours of fighting, the misunderstanding was resolved after the superiors explained that the communist troops would no longer "shout" and restrained each other, and other troops left the city one after another.</p>
<p>In addition to the military organs of the North China Suppression Headquarters, which were agreed to be handled by Fu Zuoyi himself, the transfer of hundreds of thousands of troops, including the headquarters of the 49th and 2nd Corps, eight armies, and 25 divisions, and the removal of weapons, ammunition, food, clothing, etc. in the warehouses, could not be completed in the originally estimated three days. Many practical technical issues required a lot of twists and turns and consideration. Moreover, the communist side also needed time to prepare for the takeover after entering the city. Therefore, it was not until February 1 that a part of the communist troops entered the city and announced the establishment of a joint office. In this week or so, the old were busy ending and the new had not yet entered the city, which almost became a vacuum. Many military and political personnel of greater importance took the opportunity to fly south at high prices. There were many scattered soldiers and bandits on the market, and three or five robbery cases occurred every day. There were especially many rumors. Some said that a certain troop did not accept the local peace plan, was unwilling to leave the city, and wanted to fight. The rumbling sound of digging up landmines in the city and detonating them automatically also added a lot of stimulation and tension! In short, there were more rumors than facts. The people went from guessing to suspicion, and from suspicion, there were many rumors. During this period, it was indeed hoped that the communist troops could enter the city as soon as possible to dispel many doubts.</p>
<p>A part of the political workers of the communist army had already entered the city and lived in the Beijing Hotel and Lizhi Society (formerly Cuimingzhuang) to discuss the takeover methods and procedures and prepare for all takeover work at any time. However, the entry of the communist troops into the city was on February 1. On that day, a part of the armed forces entered the city and held a simple parade. This entry parade was led by a broadcasting vehicle sent by the North China Suppression Headquarters, which broadcast to the citizens along the street at any time, saying: "Now the People's Liberation Army is entering the city, let us all applaud and welcome them!" So the citizens along the way applauded to show their welcome. The second and third cars were carrying a small number of armed communist troops and staff of the Military Control Commission, male and female political workers. The fourth car was an armed patrol car sent by the Garrison Headquarters to protect them at any time and avoid accidents. This parade passed through the major streets of the four cities of Beiping, east, south, west, and north, with the purpose of giving citizens the impression that the communist troops had come to the city.</p>
<p>The entry of the communist troops into the city was certainly not so simple. The schools and people's organizations instigated by the Communist Party certainly wanted to give a warm welcome and celebrate the "liberation" of Beiping. The communist troops also wanted to take this opportunity to hold a demonstrative parade to publicize how many weapons they had seized from the Kuomintang troops and how powerful their Liberation Army was! Therefore, February 3 was the day when the communist troops entered Beiping City and held the entry parade.</p>
<p>The weather in Beiping this year was very warm, and there was very little sandstorm. On February 3, suddenly the yellow sand covered the sky and the wind raged, which was very unfortunate! But the sandstorm could not stop their entry parade. From 8:00 a.m., Wangfujing Street and Dong'anmen Street in the eastern city were already crowded with neat lines, two rows of four people in a row, flowing south towards Tiananmen; the western city was centered on Fu Jen Catholic University, heading towards the area of Xisi Pailou North Street. Because the entry route of the communist troops was Yongdingmen on Qianmen Street as the first entrance and Xizhimen as the second entrance, the welcoming crowds also cooperated with these two routes.</p>
<p>Most of the welcoming crowds were students. Students from universities, middle schools, and primary schools were all mobilized today, beating gongs and drums, dressing up in various strange-looking roles, dancing the yangko dance, and singing various liberation songs composed by the Communist Party. Among these welcoming crowds, in addition to a small number of their cadres who became the center of instigation, there were also some opportunists who hoped to take this opportunity to show off and perform achievements in order to ingratiate themselves with the Communist Party. The antics of these people were even more enthusiastic, tense, and energetic than the Communist Party cadres themselves! Most of the crowds were watching the fun and had a nonchalant mood, which can be fully demonstrated from their actions and expressions. The news dispatches sent by AP reporter Musa and UPI reporter Gian said that the people of Beiping welcomed the People's Liberation Army with the mood of welcoming conquerors in the past. If one stands on an objective position, or is not a defender of the Communist Party, one cannot deny the correctness of their reports. This statement is indeed closer to the facts!</p>
<p>The troops entering Beiping City included infantry, cavalry, artillery, and mechanized units. The great lines, neat steps, were of course very majestic and imposing! Especially the American-style equipment seized from the Northeast, many electrical weapons such as heavy artillery, mortars, various cannons and mountain cannons, as well as battle tanks, tank cars, etc., looked really martial and amazing to the eyes of the Beiping people who had never experienced artillery fire! Many young students added flowers to the brocade and exaggerated the scene, which need not be described in detail here. The entry parade of the communist troops was so enthusiastic and tense, and it took place in a whirlwind of sand, followed by the start of the work of taking over Beiping. (Continued on page two)</p>
<h3>Supervisory Yuan Impeaches Sun Ke; Lanni's Paint Case Causes a Storm</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] The Supervisory Yuan's impeachment case against former Premier Sun Ke, after being investigated and reported by Supervisory Committee members Xiong Zaiwei and Jin Yueguang, has been declared established and the documents have been sent out. This is one of the most significant cases in the Supervisory Yuan's impeachment cases in recent years. It is said that the case was approved three days ago, but since Sun resigned from the Executive Yuan out of fear of his duties, it was officially announced on the 14th. The impeachment documents specify that Sun handled the case of 84 barrels of paint belonging to his concubine Lanni (i.e., Lan Yezhen) during his tenure as Premier of the Executive Yuan, which was obviously using his power for personal gain and dishonoring official ethics, and should be severely punished. Xiong and Jin, the two Supervisory Committee members, pointed out in their investigation report: "Our country's politics are corrupt and have reached the extreme today... To restore the people's hearts and salvage the critical situation, the minimum requirement is to establish a clean government. Sun Ke, as the highest administrative head of a country, was ordered to take office in times of difficulty... but he coveted private gain, violated the law, and dereliction of duty. If he is not severely punished, how can we appease public anger and encourage morale..." It is reported that this case was caused by Sun's request to return the paint for his concubine Lanni during his tenure as President of the Legislative and Executive Yuan. The full text of the impeachment is more than 5,000 words, which details the entire business process and Sun Ke's use of his power. It is said that on January 7, 1946, the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau seized 84 barrels of paint in the Tianhougong Bridge warehouse. At first, the so-called owner could not prove his ownership. Unexpectedly, after the auction in July of the same year, on October 1, it suddenly received a letter from Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, with his own signature, addressed to Liu Gongyun, stating that the paint was "stored in Shanghai by my family," explaining that "it is not enemy property," and "cannot be confiscated simply because its origin is unknown," requesting its prompt return. Then, in May 1947, Lan Yezhen (i.e., Lanni) submitted a petition to the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy Property Clearing Office in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui districts, stating that the paint was entrusted by her to the Jin Kang Bank, but she was arrested for suspicion of being a traitor after the victory, and the police sealed it up. She was released in January 1946, and a dispute arose between the batch of materials and the person, requesting an investigation and prompt return. Later, Director Wu Ren-cang also received letters from Hong Lanyou and Lou Tongsun pleading for Lan's case, explaining that the paint belonged to Sun Zhesheng's concubine Lan Yezhen, and requesting that it be processed in advance. Later, the office forwarded it to the Executive Yuan, which approved that the confiscated paint should be supplemented because there was still no strong evidence to support it. Later, Lanni submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan one after another, requesting its direct return. The General Executive Yuan sent it to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee for further investigation, and immediately summoned all relevant personnel to reply to the Executive Yuan. Until recently, when Sun Ke was the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee suddenly received instructions from the Executive Yuan on January 17, approving the return of the property. If it cannot be paid with items of the same type and quality, it should be paid according to the current value. The committee then decided to hand it over to the German Property Clearing Office to estimate the price of the dyes before returning them. The German Property Office stated that the types and quantities of the dyes returned in this case were hundreds of times the types and quantities claimed by the petitioner and the customs records. How to calculate and return them according to which dyes and quantities was still under review by the meeting. Xiong and Jin, the two Supervisory Committee members, believed that the witnesses presented by Lan Yezhen could not be considered to have sufficient reasons, and Sun Ke did not avoid suspicion, spoke for his concubine, and entrusted senior government officials to intercede on his behalf, which was obviously dishonoring official ethics. Later, he even instructed the Executive Yuan to return the goods at the current value, which was even more of using his power to benefit his concubine. Therefore, he specifically based the impeachment on the facts of the case.</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhaoyuan Issues Statement: Declares This Case Is Purely Legal Handling</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Zhaoyuan, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries, recently issued a statement on the Lan [surname] pigment case as follows: "Regarding this case of eighty-four barrels of pigment, the Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearance Office previously seized them based on a secret report. The pigment owner, Lan [surname], repeatedly submitted property documents requesting their return. This was delayed for several years, remaining unresolved. The Executive Yuan, considering this case a legal matter, instructed the Ministry of Justice to research and provide its opinion, which stated: Since Lan [surname] has not been convicted of treason by a court, his property cannot be regarded as property of a traitor. Since Lan [surname] is the holder of the warehouse receipt for these pigments, he should be recognized as the owner of this property. If the government wants to confiscate it, it should bear the burden of proof and cannot simply confiscate it based on a secret report. Executive Yuan Counselors E Sen and Guan Ou both held the same view and signed a request to return the pigments. This was the situation before President Sun took over the Executive Yuan, as can be verified by the records. In early January of the current year, the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries was clearing backlog cases and presented this case, along with more than thirty other pending cases, for discussion at a meeting. By an overwhelming majority vote, it was resolved that the pigments should be returned, as can also be verified by the meeting minutes. The Executive Yuan's Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries, as usual, forwarded the resolution to the Executive Yuan Secretariat, which ordered the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Industry Review Committee to review it. The review resulted in a notification to the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearance Office to complete valuation procedures in preparation for returning the pigments at their appraised value. This was because the pigments had already been sold, yielding over 20 million Legal Tender dollars, which were turned over to the national treasury. However, the competent authorities, in view of the Control Yuan's investigation into the case, have already notified the Central Trust Bureau's Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearance Office to suspend progress and await the investigation. Therefore, not a single cent has been returned to date. Based on current market prices, the total value of the pigments is less than US$5,000. The administrative authorities are purely handling this case according to law, and it has absolutely no connection to President Sun personally. Many similar cases have also been resolved by the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries with the decision to return the property, and there has been no discrepancy in treatment."</p>

<h3>Editorial: A Truly Responsible Cabinet</h3>
<p>—Second Expectation of Premier He—</p>
<p>General He Yingqin spent all day yesterday in Shanghai, discussing the formation of a cabinet with various parties, especially focusing on how the new cabinet will resolve the current economic crisis. With the overall situation so urgent, both the government and the public hope that General He will go to Nanjing as soon as possible to organize the new cabinet. Judging by the trend, this cabinet reshuffle will not be delayed for as long as three weeks, as it was during the handover between the previous two administrations of Weng and Sun.</p>
<p>Let us put aside the political, economic, and military policies that should be adopted now, and first raise a fundamental question of political system: Can General He form a truly responsible cabinet?</p>
<p>The biggest problem in China's politics in recent years, which has prevented progress and kept it from getting on track, is that it has never established a political system suitable for modern trends. However, this new system is something that China, in a period of transformation, must quickly establish. Extremely centralized states rely on rule by people; democratic states rely on rule by law. Rule by people may have the advantage of being quick to make decisions and highly efficient. However, the concentration of power also leads to particularly large abuses of dictatorship and autocracy. Rule by law may feel slow in some areas, with many checks and balances, inevitably reducing efficiency. However, with clear division of powers and orderly operation, politics is easier to get on track. China now claims to be implementing constitutionalism, and the Constitution of the Republic of China clearly stipulates that the Executive Yuan is a responsible cabinet. Therefore, the first step in curing China's political ills today should be to address this fundamental problem. Unfortunately, in the past, many people only paid attention to personnel matters and vying for positions. Few were able to put aside complex personal relationships and feudal status concepts, and work together to establish a truly responsible cabinet system. General He's cabinet formation should no longer treat this system casually.</p>
<p>According to Article 57 of the Constitution, the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan. Being responsible means being responsible for implementing policies endorsed by the Legislative Yuan. In other words, the Executive Yuan is only responsible to the Legislative Yuan when implementing its policies and legislative bills passed by the Legislative Yuan, and has no other so-called responsibility. In order to fulfill this responsibility, the Premier of the Executive Yuan has his own standards for selecting cabinet members and should not be interfered with or constrained by any party. Article 56 of the Constitution clearly stipulates: "The Vice-Premier of the Executive Yuan, the heads of the various ministries and commissions, and the ministers without portfolio shall be nominated by the Premier of the Executive Yuan and appointed by the President." From this, it can be seen that in the formation of a responsible cabinet, not only should the Legislative Yuan or legislators not interfere in advance with the candidates sought by the Premier of the Executive Yuan, but the President should also not have any say in the matter, because the Chinese Constitution does not adopt the presidential system of the United States.</p>
<p>Now that General He has been nominated by Acting President Li and approved by a majority vote in the Legislative Yuan to serve as Premier of the Executive Yuan, we believe that as all parties demand the establishment of a responsible cabinet system, Acting President Li and the legislators will trust General He and allow him complete freedom to seek cabinet members before he takes office. We hope that this is the beginning of the implementation of a good political system. Therefore, we especially urge Premier He to value his position, duties, and responsibilities. Although he can be impartial and recruit talent, he should never, in legal terms, act like the previous premiers, who constantly "sought instructions" on the left and "obeyed edicts" on the right. Not only should he recruit cabinet members by attracting talent in personnel matters, but also in administrative matters, as long as a policy is endorsed by the Legislative Yuan, he should be responsible for carrying it out and should not and cannot shirk his responsibilities under "instructions" or "edicts."</p>
<p>So, what are the real problems facing Premier He today? In summary, they are nothing more than personnel and administration, namely: (1) How to find cabinet members? (2) What policies to decide? Regarding policies, of course, the main theme is to seek the realization of peace, which we will discuss later. Here, we will first discuss how to find cabinet members. We would like to offer two principles for Premier He's reference:</p>
<p>First, seek talent. Today, people are extremely annoyed when they hear the terms "party," "faction," etc. The reason why national affairs have become so bad is that the concepts of party or faction are secretly at work! Those who join a party are favored, and those who oppose it are attacked. This has become the fashion in recent years. The idea of "a new dynasty, a new set of officials" still faintly exists. To the extreme, classmates, associations, clubs, fellow provincials and countrymen, and even... nepotism can all become the basis for spoils distribution. As a result, governance does not ask about policies, and work does not emphasize efficiency. As long as one has connections, everyone can be promoted. The atmosphere in officialdom is getting worse and worse. Real talent is either in seclusion or in decline. Who else can stand out? Moreover, in this difficult situation, it is already difficult to find real talent even when treating scholars with courtesy. If one seeks talent from the group who come to seek positions, it is already second-rate. We know that Premier He has not even had a private secretary since resigning as Minister of National Defense. This demeanor is already very rare. Today, as he is ordered to form a cabinet, he should broaden his horizons, open his mind, be absolutely impartial, and humbly seek talent. When recruiting someone to join the cabinet, he should only ask whether he is truly talented, and not care about which party, faction, group, school, association, or province he belongs to. Especially, he should not be misled by divisive terms such as "progressive," "backward," "enlightened," "stubborn," "democratic," "reactionary," etc., and cause talented people to be left in obscurity and sycophants to be promoted to high positions.</p>
<p>Second, take responsibility. In times of hardship, when seeking talent to assist in governance, it is necessary not only to have learning and talent but also to be willing to take responsibility. It is often seen that many talented people, after spending many years in officialdom, become infected with the bureaucratic habits of saying "yes" to everything and shirking responsibility. These people may not be without talent, but they may not be able to shoulder great responsibilities because they lack the ability to take responsibility. What is valued in a responsible cabinet is that not only must the Premier bear overall responsibility, but the cabinet members must also each bear responsibility to the Premier for implementing policies within their respective areas of expertise. If most of the people sought by the Premier are "rubber-stamp" officials who ask for instructions on everything and submit every matter for review, then they are too far from the word "responsibility." Without cabinet members who can truly take responsibility, how can a truly responsible cabinet be formed by relying on one Premier alone?</p>
<p>When we read history, we always see that the rise and fall of dynasties are inseparable from the advancement and retreat of talent. When gentlemen decline, villains rise; when villains decline, gentlemen rise. Although this is said to be the trend of the times, the ability to reverse the situation lies in the vision of those in high positions. Talent, talent, when and where is it not available? It depends on whether those in power can recognize it, use it, and use it properly. Premier He should not fail to live up to the expectations of the people!</p>
<h3>Commander of the 17th Pacification Zone, Li Mo'an, Decides to Resign, Believing that the Xiangxi Incident Was Caused by Remnant Feudal Forces</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Changsha, 14th] Li Mo'an, Commander of the 17th Pacification Zone, has decided to resign and requests the abolition of the 17th Pacification Zone. Li's view on the Xiangxi incident is as follows: (1) The so-called "popular uprising" is in name only; the real purpose is to obstruct political reform and protect the vested interests of remnant feudal forces. (2) It is the death struggle of a counter-revolutionary group. (3) It is a possible disturbance encountered in the process of implementing revolutionary strategy. (4) The oppressors claim to be the oppressed; "anti-oppression" is a great irony of their own essence. (5) The counter-revolutionary disturbance in Xiangxi is anti-era and anti-progressive; all its ideas and actions will set history back fifty years.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Changsha, 14th] Wugang also has "unclear situation" rumors. Bandits from Chenxi are moving east. Zhang Dazhi occupied Shaojiwan, at the junction of Yuanling and Luxi, and Yang Guangyao occupied Sanjiaoping. Their intentions are unknown.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Changsha, 14th] The fall of Xupu has been rumored here repeatedly. According to reliable information, the bandits harassing Xupu consist of two groups: one is Shi Meihou, from Zhang Yulin's troops based in Chenxi, who sneaked into Dajiangkou, in Xupu County; the other is Xiang Chengzhu, a self-proclaimed commander of a certain division of the 14th Column from Longtan. It is still impossible to ascertain which group is approaching the city of Xupu. Deng Feihuang, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, told reporters: The Magistrate of Xupu County did send an urgent telegram on the 10th, but it is not yet confirmed whether the city has fallen. Li Dongsheng's bandits fled from Southern Chenxi and have been confirmed to have captured Huaihua. County Magistrate Zhang Zhifan was taken hostage in Yushuwan.</p>
<h3>Haiwen Ship Encountered Danger on the Way Back to Shanghai from the Philippines, Towed to Hong Kong for Repairs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 14th] The Haiwen, a Chinese ship chartered by the International Refugee Organization, encountered danger due to heavy fog a few miles south of here on the 13th and was towed here by a tugboat this morning. The ship was originally en route to Shanghai after unloading refugees on Samar Island in the Philippines and was passing through Hong Kong to refuel. According to the Polish captain of the ship, there was no apparent danger of the ship sinking at the time, but some crew members issued a distress call and launched lifeboats without orders. Some crew members claimed that the ship had already tilted 45 degrees before they obtained the captain's permission to use the radio. They also said that they would not return to work on the ship. Fortunately, there were no casualties in the accident. The ship is now anchored outside the dock, tilted 35 degrees, and is awaiting repairs. It is said that the damage is very minor.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Restricts Outward Shipment of Gold and Silver, Sets Four Supplementary Measures</h3>

<h3>Hankou Silver Yuan and Spun Yarn Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hankou, 14th] The black market prices of silver yuan and spun yarn in Wuhan suddenly plummeted on the 14th. The silver yuan price fell from 4,100 yuan to 3,400 yuan, and the spun yarn price fell from 1.2 million yuan to 750,000 yuan. It is reported that the decline was partly due to the influence of the Shanghai market, but mostly due to the fact that people here launched an investigation into the First Yarn Factory. The factory was eager to recover yarn receipts, which caused yarn merchants to sell off large amounts of silver yuan in order to pay in cash.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Municipal Council Exchanges Views, Decides to Request Suspension of Conscription</h3>

<h3>Gold Confiscated for Being Smuggled into Hong Kong Amounted to Over 7,000 Taels Last Year, Estimated Number of Those Who Evaded the Law Must Be Very Large</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] As Hong Kong is one of the sterling bloc countries and the United Kingdom is a signatory to the International Monetary Fund agreement, Hong Kong also has an obligation to comply with the signed treaty and prohibits the import of gold. Last year alone, the amount of gold confiscated for being imported without prior permission from the Hong Kong authorities reached a staggering 7,200 taels. Among them, more than 4,275 taels were confiscated from January to September, more than 692 taels were confiscated in October, more than 1,132 taels were confiscated in November, and more than 1,099 taels were confiscated in December. Gold artifacts were not included. The total value of the confiscated goods must be over HK$2,357,100. However, it is estimated that the number of those who evaded the law is also considerable. It is reported that the gold entering and leaving Hong Kong last year exceeded 3 million taels.</p>

According to the person in charge of the League's secretariat, since the China Democratic League was declared illegal by the Kuomintang government in October 1947, in addition to the local organizations going underground to continue fighting, the headquarters was moved to Hong Kong to work. Recently, as the heads of the headquarters successively arrived in the "Liberated Areas," in order to adapt to the new situation and strengthen the leadership of domestic and foreign League affairs, it was decided to move the headquarters from Hong Kong to Beiping. Before the relocation work of the headquarters is completed, a temporary working committee of the headquarters will be established in Beiping to prepare for the convening of the Fourth Central Plenary Session of the China Democratic League and to represent the League externally. The committee was formally established on the 5th, with members including Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Dongsun, Zhu Yunshan, Pan Guangdan, Li Zhangda, Qiu Ze, Wu Han, Deng Chumin, Chen Zisheng, Wei Zhichao, Han Zhao'e, Chu Tunan, Shen Zhiyuan, Li Wenyi, Liu Qingyang, Zhang Yunchuan, Peng Zemin, Qian Jiaju, Hu Yuzhi, Yan Xinmin, and Chen Dingwen, totaling 22 people.

<h3>The Beiping Type</h3>
<p>[Continued from the First Page] On February 12th, which was the fifteenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, various people's organizations and students in Beiping City held a grand celebration to celebrate the liberation of Beiping. From 7:00 in the morning, people were gathering in every corner of the city and setting off separately. The celebration was originally scheduled to start at 10:00 in the morning, but Tiananmen Square was already packed before 9:00. The east-west range was marked by the Three Arched Gates, and the south extended even further. Before the meeting started, gongs and drums resounded to the sky, and the performing troupes of various organizations twisted and turned in Yangge dances, vying to be the most unique and competitive. Among them, the performing troupe of North China People's University was particularly outstanding, as they were specially trained. Their Yangge dance was exceptionally standard and authentic, and many people who wanted to learn the Yangge dance were enthusiastically and attentively observing their movements. Every time the Chinese Communist Party arrives in a place, the first thing that influences the local people is the widespread transmission and practice of liberation songs and the Yangge dance. "The East is Red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong, he is the great savior of the Chinese people, he is the great savior of the Chinese people..." is a song that even three-year-old children can hum. The Yangge dance was originally a folk art practiced by the people of rural North China and Northeast China during the first month of the lunar calendar. The steps are simple, and it can be performed anywhere as long as it is accompanied by gongs and drums. Now, it has become a representative work of the Chinese Communist Party. After Beiping achieved partial peace, liberation songs and Yangge dances could be heard and seen everywhere.</p>
<p>Ye Jianying explained the significance of the liberation of Beiping and the tasks of military control at the celebration. He said that in order to accomplish the tasks of military control, it was also necessary to arrest war criminals and leading figures of the reactionaries who must be arrested. This gave the people a concrete impression that the increasingly tight situation in Beiping was an inevitable phenomenon.</p>
<p>(3) Their Flag is a Sickle, Axe and a Star</p>
<p>In general propaganda, Beiping is presented as having achieved "partial peace." The official statement from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specifically pointed out the exemplary role of the partial peace in Beiping. Their intention is to hope that military and political leaders across the country will follow the example of General Fu Zuoyi and use the partial peace in Beiping as a model. The partial peace in Beiping has invisibly become a type, a "Beiping-type" of peace! Personnel from the Communist Party's urban work department are also spreading the word within the city that after the realization of partial peace in Beiping, a coalition government will be established, which is different from the liberation of Shenyang, Changchun, and Tianjin. The takeover work in Beiping will also be handled by a joint organization, with four members from the Communist Party and three from Fu Zuoyi's side. The four members from the Communist Party are Ye Jianying, Xu Bing, Tao Zhu, and Rong Zihe; the three from Fu Zuoyi's side are Guo Zongfen, Zhou Beifeng, and Jiao Shizhai. These seven people will form a committee, with Ye Jianying as the chairman and Guo Zongfen as the vice-chairman, jointly responsible for handling the handover work. On the surface, this is also a form of union. However, the large-character slogans written by the Communist army on the city walls of Beiping's outer city say, "Fu Zuoyi Leads His Troops to Surrender." What exactly is being sold in this gourd? What kind of situation will it ultimately be? The people living in the city of Beiping are witnessing many phenomena and experiencing many facts firsthand, and cannot help but raise questions.</p>
<p>Will the Communist Party establish a government in Beiping? What kind of political system will it use? What name? What flag? …This series of questions are on the minds of the residents, hoping to get answers.</p>
<p>According to my personal understanding, the Communist Party will inevitably establish a national people's government in Beiping. As for the time and manner of its establishment, it will depend on the development of the overall situation and international changes. Or, it is likely to be formally formed after the New Political Consultative Conference. According to Mao Zedong's two articles published during the Anti-Japanese War, "On New Democracy" and "On Coalition Government," as well as recent editorials in the Xinhua Daily and broadcasts from the Chinese Communist Party, the future national people's government will still be in the form of a coalition government, implementing the "three-thirds system": one-third for the Communist Party, one-third for progressive elements of the Nationalist Party and various democratic parties, and one-third for social elites. An editorial in the Xinhua Daily stated: "Overthrow the reactionary rule of the Nationalist Party throughout the country, and establish a people's democratic dictatorship republic led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance throughout the country." It also said: "In 1949, a Political Consultative Conference will be convened without the participation of reactionary elements, with the goal of completing the people's revolutionary tasks, declaring the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of China, and forming the central government of the republic. This government will be a democratic coalition government under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the participation of appropriate representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations." Isn't this a clear indication of their attitude and approach? According to recent newspaper reports, as a result of the meeting of representatives from various parties in Fanyang to discuss the matter, the political system will adopt a federal system. The name of their state will be the "People's Democratic Republic of China," and the flag will be a sickle, an axe, and a star, with a red background and yellow designs. The flag currently used by the People's Liberation Army is such a flag. Based on these many conditions and facts, it is, of course, a fundamental negation and overthrow of the existing Nanjing Nationalist government. Mao Zedong's eight-point peace declaration, which included the abolition of the puppet regime and the abolition of the puppet constitution, has also blatantly stated this intention.

<h3>Western European Five-Nation Consultative Conference Opens, Discussing Joint Defense and Other Issues, Foreign, Finance, and Military Leaders All Attend</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The Consultative Committee meeting of the Western European Union opened in London this morning to discuss defense issues. A press release from the British Foreign Office announced that the current meeting was opened by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. Attendees included British Foreign Secretary Bevin, French Foreign Minister Schuman, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker, and Luxembourg representative Dupont. The agenda for the meeting included three points: the Atlantic Pact, the Western European Constitution, and Western European Defense. This consultative conference is the most important one since the establishment of the Western European Union. In addition to the foreign ministers of the five countries, a large number of defense experts and advisors, as well as senior officers from the three armed forces, attended the meeting of this Western European Union decision-making body. After the usual opening ceremony and preliminary discussions, the meeting was immediately divided into three subgroups for secret discussions. Diplomatic circles believe that the military committee of the Western European Union Consultative Committee, under the chairmanship of Marshal Montgomery, will reach an agreement on the following three points: (1) Appoint General Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the Army of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, with Marshal Montgomery as his deputy. Headquarters may be established in London. (2) Distribute surplus US military supplies to the countries of the Atlantic Pact. (3) Supply France and the Netherlands with the latest British and American jet propulsion aircraft.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] The Western European Five-Nation Consultative Committee is composed of the foreign ministers of the five countries and meets every three months. This meeting differs from previous meetings in two respects: (1) The meeting was held ahead of schedule. The original date was April 25, but before that date, there will be two new developments: the signing of the Atlantic Pact and the holding of a ten-nation conference to establish a European parliament as the central body of the European Union. Therefore, the countries of the Brussels Pact decided to meet before these events occur to reach an agreement on details and procedures. (2) The meeting has been expanded. In addition to the foreign ministers of the five countries, the ministers of defense and finance are also participating in the discussions. This indicates that the meeting will focus on the military and financial issues arising from the Atlantic Pact, such as US military aid, the distribution of this aid among Western European countries, mutual assistance among these countries in rearmament, and the responsibilities that each country should bear in common defense and mutual assistance.</p>

<h3>Powerful British Reinforcements Land at the Port of Aqaba; Jewish Needs a Seaport, Insists on Sovereignty over Eilat</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Aqaba, 14th] Powerful British reinforcements landed here today. Troops, tanks, and light armored vehicles were all transported ashore by landing craft, while military aircraft also landed slowly on the land.

<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Amman, the capital of Transjordan, officially announced that British reinforcements have landed at the port of Aqaba on the north coast of the Red Sea. At the same time, according to reports from Tel Aviv, the Israeli government announced that it has occupied a 10-kilometer-long coastline along the Gulf of Aqaba, called the Eilat area. According to well-informed sources here, the British troops stationed in Aqaba will adopt a strict non-interference policy towards the actions of Jews on the Red Sea coast of Palestine. Aqaba is about three kilometers from the border between Transjordan and Israel, and the presence of British troops is unlikely to cause trouble. Israel's occupation of the Eilat area allows it to obtain a seaport on the Red Sea. A spokesman for the British War Office declined to comment on the report from Amman that British troops had landed in Aqaba. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office also said that the strength of the British troops stationed in Aqaba is a military secret.

Observers also said that the Israeli government has always insisted on its sovereignty in the Eilat area, so it will never sign any agreement with Transjordan that does not confirm this right. The Israeli army began to advance towards the Eilat area after occupying the city of Beersheba in southern Palestine last October, in order to open up a land route to the Dead Sea potash factory area. Potash is one of the main exports of Israel.</p>

<h3>Inside Story of the Robbery at the Hotel; More Startling Discoveries; One of the Five Male Strange Guests is Actually a China National Aviation Corporation Pilot</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Behind the scenes of the hijacking of China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Qingdao flight, despite the relevant authorities maintaining secrecy, reporters have made new and startling discoveries after various inquiries, revealing the truth. It is reported that among the five male passengers who hijacked the plane, apart from Xing Guozheng, Hua Xinghang, and Liu Shurong, who were employees of the Civil Aviation Administration, the other two, Li Yun, was actually a pilot of China National Aviation Corporation himself, and Chen Tiesheng, was a mechanic from another airline in this city.</p>
<p>Li Yun is one of the co-pilots of China National Aviation Corporation. Reporters confirmed this with the company authorities yesterday. However, it is claimed that this person was dismissed by the company several months ago due to poor technical skills and inability to become a full pilot.</p>
<p>Chen Tiesheng is a mechanic from another airline in this city. Due to time constraints, it was not possible to confirm this with the company yesterday, but this information was revealed by reliable sources and is believed to be true.</p>
<p>The Civil Aviation Administration's Air Traffic Control Station has admitted that Xing Guozheng, Hua Xinghang, and Liu Shurong were once staff members of the station, but it is claimed that these people were dismissed a year ago due to staff reductions.</p>
<p>According to reporters, Li Yun, Xing Guozheng, and the other five people had previously served in the Air Force and were classmates who went to the United States for training. After returning to China, either they were eliminated or dissatisfied with reality, and under the temptation of Communist propaganda, they conspired in this hijacking. As for whether they had contact with the Communists beforehand, it is not known. Since they were employees of the company and the Civil Aviation Administration, they must have known the co-pilot Shu Zhilun and the telegraph operator Wang Qingyuan on Flight 135. Therefore, according to yesterday's Qingdao telegraph from this newspaper, when they launched the hijacking and used guns to threaten them, Shu and Wang even said, "Don't joke around."</p>

<h3>Petition to Allocate Funds to Reissue Cooking Oil to Public Servants and Teachers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch] The allocation of cooking oil to public servants and teachers in the Nanjing-Shanghai area has not been issued since December of last year. According to inquiries, this matter was originally handled by the China Vegetable Oil Science Factory under commission, and the required oil funds were all allocated from the national treasury. However, since December of last year, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has notified that the Nanjing and Shanghai municipal governments will take over the task. At the same time, the amount of oil allocated in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas reached more than 3,400 dan per month, which was too large, and the factory was unable to advance the funds. The Shanghai Public Servants and Teachers Materials Supply Committee has discussed this matter repeatedly and has recently decided to submit a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to promptly allocate funds to reissue the supplies in kind. It is reported that the oil funds for January, February, and March of this year have been submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Executive Yuan for approval, but have not yet been allocated due to the relocation of the central government to the south.</p>

<h3>Book Industry Accuses National Bank of Unfairness for Not Receiving Loans; Discount and Loan Committee Issues Statement; Loans to Commercial Press and Others Not for Paper; They Are for Printing National Textbooks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Discount and Loan Committee of the Central Bank, in response to a newspaper report that the 416 members of the Shanghai Book Industry Association questioned the unfair allocation of paper by the Central Bank and an urgent announcement questioning Central Bank Governor Liu Gongyun and Business Bureau Director Lin Chongyong, issued the following statement: The Commercial Press and other bookstores have been approved by the Ministry of Education to print national textbooks for many years. Every year, during the two seasons, they are approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury and receive loans from national banking institutions to make textbook prices particularly low, thereby reducing the burden on primary and secondary school students across the country. These loans are not given for the allocation of paper. When the Four Banks Joint Treasury was ordered to be abolished and the business was transferred to the National Bank Discount and Loan Committee, the Ministry of Education sent a letter to the National Bank in December of last year requesting that loans of 44.462 million yuan be granted according to the established case and sent representatives to Shanghai for consultation. The committee approved a loan of 15 million yuan, and the number of borrowers and the distribution ratio were handled according to the Ministry of Education's opinion. In February of this year, nineteen bookstores stated that prices had fluctuated sharply and that the amount previously borrowed was insufficient. They sent another letter to the National Bank requesting an increase in the loan amount. The 26th Discount and Loan Committee meeting on February 14 resolved to approve an increase in the loan to 150 million yuan according to the previous case, still designated for the printing of national textbooks. As for Wanye Bookstore and other four bookstores, they were also approved to print national textbooks and hold certificates from the Ministry of Education to apply for loans. The National Bank Discount and Loan Committee loaned them the remaining 1.5 million yuan from the 150 million yuan, averaging about 370,000 yuan per bookstore.</p>
<h3>No Precedent for Applying for Loan to Cover Paper Allocation Costs; Inconvenient to Grant Loan</h3>
<p>On February 25, Baisin Bookstore and other 466 bookstores applied for a loan to cover the cost of paper allocation. As usual, this was submitted to the 28th Discount and Loan Committee meeting on March 1 for deliberation. At that time, the attending committee members felt that the funds loaned to the Commercial Press and other bookstores in the past were used for printing national textbooks, not for covering the cost of paper allocation. The request from the 466 bookstores was very different, and there was no precedent to follow. It was inconvenient to grant the loan. Furthermore, the National Bank had small industrial loans to support small factories. The more than 400 bookstores had printing houses attached and met the requirements for small industrial loans. They could apply for small industrial loans according to their scale and equipment to cope with the situation. It was resolved that this case should be politely rejected. The above is the situation of the National Bank Discount and Loan Committee approving loans to nineteen bookstores and rejecting other bookstores.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Barber and Bathhouse Industries Request Modification of Pricing Method; Social Affairs Bureau Instructs to Submit Written Request for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Seven representatives of the barber and bathhouse industries in the city went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon to petition for a modification of the method of multiplying the base number by the cost of living index, which was approved by the municipal meeting. They hoped to base it on the price index or submit a base number. The Social Affairs Bureau replied that they should submit their specific opinions in writing for review.</p>
<h3>Book Industry Sends Representatives to the National Bank for Consultation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Book Industry Association yesterday, the local publishing industry was unable to order paper for the sixth season due to the sharp rise in foreign exchange transfer certificates, and the paper stocks of various bookstores had long been used up. If the supply of paper was interrupted, the publishing industry would inevitably be forced to close down, seriously affecting the supply of spiritual food. Therefore, the association had repeatedly requested the Central Bank to advance funds for the entire order, as was done for the newspaper industry. However, the Central Bank only approved loans to a small number of large bookstores (19) and rejected the requests of more than 400 bookstores. This matter was heard by bookstores throughout the city, and the public was in a state of anxiety, raising questions one after another. In addition to publishing appeals in newspapers to ask all sectors of society to uphold justice, it is reported that the association has publicly appointed Chairman Zhang Yiqu, Supervisor Du Yuesheng, and standing directors Yu Shun, Huang Zhongming, Wang Zicheng, and others to mediate the solution and will visit Governor Liu of the Central Bank today (the 15th) for consultation.</p>
<h3>Arrested and Prosecuted for Predatory Sale of Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Zeng Alin (at large), manager of Wanxing Cotton Yarn Store on Haining Road, and shareholders Sun Zhiwen, Fan Jiufu, and others, from February 16 to 19 of this year, pre-sold one or two pieces each of cotton yarn of Lanfeng, Shima, Shuangdiqiu, and other brands to Pei Deyi, Yu Jinghua, Zhang Fuqi, Ding Haikun, Qi Shiwo, and others, collecting more than 2.2 million yuan before fleeing. Later, the victims met Sun and the others on the road and took them to the police station, who transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Murder Case on Jiangsu Road Remains Elusive; It is Determined That There Was More Than One Perpetrator; It Was Neither Revenge Killing Nor Murder for Money</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Although various parties have been working hard to investigate the murder case of Wu Li Xiuzhen, a housewife residing at No. 46, Alley A, No. 76, Jiangsu Road, for days, no important discoveries have been made. According to the reporter's inquiries from various relevant parties, at least several points can be determined regarding the perpetrator(s): (1) The deceased had a total of sixteen fatal wounds, which were puncture wounds rather than cuts. The deceased's body was kneeling in front of the bed, and the radio in the room was moved to the back door and the volume turned up high during the crime, proving that there was definitely more than one perpetrator. (2) Although the deceased's family has many members, they go to work in factories or attend school early in the morning, leaving only the deceased at home in the morning. The perpetrators acted at this time, proving that it was a long-planned scheme and that they seemed to be unusually familiar with the deceased's family. (3) The deceased had been married to her husband, Wu Shiren, for eleven years. Because of his honest and kind nature, he had good relationships with his family and neighbors. Furthermore, she managed the household affairs and rarely went out. In the past, she had never had disputes, borrowed money, or been involved in lawsuits. The perpetrators did not take away any property after committing the crime, proving that this case was not a revenge killing or murder for money. According to general speculation, the deceased was thirty-five years old when she married Wu, so the perpetrator(s) may have been someone she knew before she was thirty-five, or someone who held a grudge for some reason. Later, they moved far away to another place and recently found an opportunity to commit this heinous crime. However, according to the reporter's interview with the deceased's mother's family, they stated that they could not confirm this point because the deceased had never been in love or had disagreements with anyone before her marriage. Therefore, a similar love triangle murder is definitely impossible.</p>

<h3>Faculty and Staff of National Universities and Colleges Unanimously Insist on Receiving Salaries According to the Index; The Professors' Association Decides to Issue a Protest Letter to the Government</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Regional National College and University Professors' Association held its sixth regular meeting yesterday afternoon at Jiaotong University. Regarding the issue of compensation, the meeting believed that when the university presidents petitioned in Nanjing last time, the person in charge of the Ministry of Education had verbally agreed to pay salaries at 500 times the base rate. Subsequently, the Ministry of Education suddenly sent a telegram instructing that the March salaries should be calculated at three times the February standard of 75 times the base rate. This was a breach of faith. It was decided to issue a protest letter to the government, insisting on the two principles of not discounting the original salary and issuing salaries according to the price index. At the same time, the presidents of each school were asked to expedite the issuance of March salaries. Sympathy was expressed for the self-funded students' efforts to obtain public funding. The association decided to establish a welfare association, with Tongji, Shanghai Medical, and Shanghai Business schools responsible for promoting it. A letter was sent to the Economic Research Institute of Fudan University and the Chinese Economic Research Institute requesting them to provide price index data and to maintain regular contact with the welfare association.</p>
<p>In addition, it was decided to establish a Higher Education System Research Committee, with Jiaotong, Tongji, and Fudan universities responsible, and Jiaotong University serving as the convener.</p>
<p>The professors of National Yingshi University in Jinhua wanted to join the association. After discussion at yesterday's meeting, they were welcomed. Because various schools outside of Shanghai were joining, the association's organizational charter needed to be revised and will be discussed at the next meeting. The next meeting is scheduled for 2:00 PM on March 27th at Fudan University.</p>
<p>Also, the Shanghai Municipal National College and University Teaching Assistants and Lecturers Association, dissatisfied with the salary multipliers and the cancellation of in-kind allocations in favor of differential payments, decided at a meeting yesterday to demand: (1) Salaries be paid fully according to the local index. (2) In-kind allocations continue as usual.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Refugee Students; The Authorities Feel Deeply Troubled; Food May Be Interrupted</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Bureau of Education and the Bureau of Social Affairs feel that the problem of refugee students from Northeast and Shandong coming to Shanghai is difficult to solve. When Acting Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education came to Shanghai a few days ago, Director Li asked him for a solution. Chen promised to send someone to Shanghai to handle this matter, but has not yet arrived. Although the Shandong Provincial Department of Education has an office in Shanghai, it also has no way to settle the refugee students in Shanghai. The food problem of refugee students is temporarily being relieved by the Bureau of Social Affairs, but this congee distribution is about to stop. Both bureaus of social affairs and education sincerely hope that the central government will have a comprehensive solution to the problem of refugee students.</p>
<h3>Staff of Various Schools Urge the Issuance of In-Kind Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai National College and University Staff Association has elected Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, Tongji, and Shanghai Business schools as executive directors, with Jinan University serving as the association's communication address. In addition to asking the presidents of various universities to forward the request for professional development fees to the authorities, the association has also telegraphed Acting President Li, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education. In addition, it was decided to join the Professors' Association and the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Faculty and Staff Association to urge the relevant authorities to quickly issue the allocated coal briquettes and cooking oil.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Fudan University Workers' Association began signing petitions on the 13th, making three demands: (1) The base salary be adjusted to 60 yuan. (2) Salaries be paid fully according to the local cost of living index. (3) Professional development and training fees be issued.</p>
<h3>Self-Funded Students Petition; Departure Date Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The departure date of the petition representatives from the Shanghai Municipal National College and University Federation to Nanjing has not yet been determined. At the same time, publicly funded students in each school also believe that the public funds are insufficient and the meals are too poor, and demand that the public funds be adjusted according to the price index, and join the self-funded students' struggle for public funds as a "struggle for survival" movement. Jiaotong University students have established a "Struggle for Survival Committee" and scheduled a "Speak Bitterness" evening party this Thursday to tell about the current plight of teachers, students and staff.</p>
<h3>Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Visit the Director of the Bureau of Education to Request Five Items</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Primary and Secondary School Faculty and Staff Association has dispatched representatives Xi Zhenken, Zhou He, Li Zhanren, Mao Wenpei, etc., to visit Director Li of the Bureau of Education, requesting several points: (1) Please reissue the salary for February according to the original base salary, without any deductions, multiplied by the cost of living index. (2) Please expedite the preliminary issuance of the salary for March according to the original base salary multiplied by the cost of living index. (3) In-kind allocation of public education has been delayed for several periods, such as cooking oil and coal briquettes. Please transfer to the competent authority to quickly reissue them, and hope that they can be issued on time in the future. (4) Please refer to the base salary of other civil servants to increase the base salary of teachers to emphasize education. (5) Request that the welfare benefits of public educators in this city be the same, and that the children of colleagues of city school faculty and staff can also obtain education loans. Director Li stated that he would forward the request to the mayor for approval.</p>
<h3>Private Universities and Colleges Decide to Form a Federation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The presidents of various private universities and colleges in this city held a symposium yesterday at the Tsinghua Alumni Association. 27 people attended, including Ou Yuanhuai, Ling Xianyang, Wang Yukai, Hu Dunfu, Zhao Xiuhong, Liao Shicheng, and Liu Haisu. It was decided to formally organize the Shanghai Municipal Private College and University Federation. Because the organizational charter and other matters still need to be discussed, the establishment date will be in one or two weeks.</p>
<p>At yesterday's symposium, regarding the spring break issue for private universities and colleges this semester, it was decided that the vacation should be based on the principle of three days, and the vacation dates should be determined by each school.</p>
<h3>University Students from Peiping and Tianjin Arrive in Shanghai; Discuss Northern Education; The Chinese Communists Run Three Universities in Peiping</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zhang Zhendong and five other students from Fu Jen Catholic University in Peiping, Li Shaoyuan and several other students from Chaoyang University, and Wu Zhengtao and nine other students from the Tianjin National Guoshu Physical Education Teachers College recently arrived in Shanghai. The reporter made a special visit to their residence to inquire about the situation of the schools in Peiping and Tianjin. According to the students from Chaoyang and other schools, they and a group of more than ten people left Peiping for Tianjin on the 26th of last month. On the 27th, nine classmates from Guoshu Physical Education Teachers College joined them. They passed through Cangxian and transferred to Jinan. Because they had travel permits, they were not hindered along the way. They registered in Qingdao, took a free boat, and arrived in Shanghai on the 12th. Currently, the Chinese Communists run three universities in Peiping: (1) North China University, which graduates in two years. (2) Military and Political University. (3) People's Revolutionary University, which graduates in four months. The original food allowance for students of national universities was 45 catties of millet per person, and 120 catties of millet for professors. Private universities have difficulty maintaining themselves due to a lack of funding and considerable restrictions on tuition fees. It is difficult for students to study in private universities except those who volunteer to join the three universities run by the Chinese Communists. According to the students of Guoshu Physical Education Teachers College, the school is temporarily managed by a person elected from among the professors by the professors' association. The Chinese Communists have sent two instructors to the school, abolished the Department of Student Affairs, and removed courses such as scouting, military training, civics, ethics, and Chinese language (Chinese language will be revised). In addition to teaching, teachers have study sessions in the morning, reading designated books. In the evening, review meetings are held to review study issues. Teachers and students cooperate in labor service. It is reported that the students from the three schools who came south will go to Hangzhou to discuss transfer issues with the office of the Ministry of Education. It is also reported that dozens of students from other universities in Peiping and Tianjin, such as Peking University and Northeastern University, have also come to Shanghai to contact the Municipal Bureau of Education. The bureau has provided guidance on food and accommodation issues and instructed them to wait for the person in charge sent by the Ministry of Education to contact them directly regarding transfer registration.</p>

<h3>Extinguishing the Wildfires in Western Hunan; Focusing on Appeasement Rather Than Suppression is the Way to Cut Off the Fuel</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru</p>
<p>[Aviation Report from Changsha, May 5th] Western Hunan is located at the tail end of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with overlapping mountains and impoverished areas. This place originally belonged to an uncivilized area. It was only after the Miao Rebellion during the Qing Yongzheng period that it was transformed from Tusi (local chieftain) rule to Liuguan (government official) rule. However, due to the special topography of the country and the low level of education of the people, even though it was changed from Tusi to Liuguan rule, local forces were still particularly strong. The only difference was that the ruling power was transferred from the hands of the Miao chieftains to some Han Chinese bullies. Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Western Hunan was still a mysterious area in the eyes of the Chinese people. It was filled with bandits and tyrannical local bullies, and few outsiders dared to set foot in it.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to its topography, Western Hunan was blessed and the enemy's hooves never set foot on this land. It became a paradise, and refugee groups flocked to it. The closed Western Hunan was opened. However, it was not easy for "people from the lower river" (people from Western Hunan call people below Changtao "people from the lower river," and Sichuanese people call people from other provinces "people from the lower river") to pour into this mysterious area. In the beginning, the government had to go through a lot of trouble. First, they used all kinds of tricks to get the "King of Western Hunan," Chen Quzhen, to transfer his troops out of Hunan, and then invited Chen himself to live as a recluse in the suburbs of Chongqing. In addition, the central government sent Commander Gu Zhenglun, known as "Tiger Gu," to set up the Gendarmerie Headquarters in Zhijiang, responsible for suppressing bandits in Western Hunan. In Western Hunan, in order to eradicate banditry, "Tiger Gu" sometimes did not hesitate to slaughter entire villages. The provincial government also established an administrative office in Yuanling and established a garrison headquarters. At that time, when the local forces had not been eradicated at all, the official documents of Garrison Commander Sun Changjun could not even leave the headquarters gate. Commander Sun carefully dealt with the environment through repeated concessions and compromises. When a suitable opportunity arose, he used lightning-fast means to kill a famous local bully, which temporarily suppressed the situation and gradually brought order back on track. Later, not only Yuanling and Zhijiang became paradises for "people from the lower river," but even Qiancheng and Yongshun and other places had traces of outsiders. After the National College of Commerce, National Eighth Middle School, Chadong Normal School, and other schools were established in this barbaric area, young students full of vigor and vitality could be seen on the ridges of the mountains and the banks of the rivers, and the music of pioneers of the times could be heard. At that time, no one living in this area would have thought that this was the mysterious area that outsiders had regarded as a dangerous place they dared not set foot in a few years ago. Western Hunan was transformed and its appearance was completely different.</p>
<p>The People of Western Hunan Are Not Afraid of Hardship</p>
<p>Western Hunan changed its appearance, and the mystery was revealed. It gave "people from the lower river" the impression that the common people here were not the imagined red-eyed and green-browed judges, but rather the typical honest and kind Chinese people. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the reporter fled here from the distant lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and was most interested in the fact that this was a place where people did not pick up lost items. Clothes were dried on the threshing floor, and they were not collected indoors at night, and nothing would be lost. The people of Western Hunan are simple, straightforward, stubborn, and fond of fighting. They hate stealing most of all. If they cannot solve their livelihood, they will take a kitchen knife to kill and rob, and that is the hero everyone admires. They are most afraid of hardship, and they will resist any pressure. I remember that on the eve of the Battle of Western Hunan, the 18th Army stationed in the Changtao area had very bad discipline, and the people of Changtao were as docile and sheep-like and never dared to resist. Later, the army was transferred to the Chenxi area, and one division with the worst discipline was stationed in Pushi, forcibly occupying civilian houses, which aroused resentment from the local people. They gathered guns, knives, and spears and attacked the military camp at night, killing more than 80 soldiers of the National Army. The 18th Army, which had modern weapons, was actually suppressed by these fearless people from Western Hunan.</p>
<p>The Ambitious Ones Raise Their Heads Again</p>
<p>During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of Western Hunan, like people in other parts of the country, contributed money and manpower, especially manpower, because the people of Western Hunan liked to fight and were not afraid to be soldiers, so there were many conscriptions. However, the situation was not necessarily very smooth. As mentioned earlier, the true ruling power in Western Hunan was completely in the hands of a few local bullies. Conscription had to go through the hands of the village chiefs, and the village chiefs were representatives or pawns of the local bullies. The kind people of Western Hunan inevitably suffered from the exploitation of the village chiefs. As a result, there was a bandit Peng Jiaoluzi in the Yongshun area, who roamed Western Hunan for several years under the banner of resisting Japan and resisting grain. It was not until the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan that it was suppressed by Chuan Zhongfang.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the political center of Hunan moved back to Changsha, and a large number of "people from the lower river" gradually left Western Hunan. Gradually, this place became a world where "the heavens are high and the emperor is far away." A few local ambitious elements slowly raised their heads. They used the psychology of the poor people to grow tobacco, resist grain, and resist conscription to create toxins in the local area. When the time was right, they seized an opportunity and rose up in rebellion. From the victory to today, three years have passed, and it should be ripe. Therefore, in the midst of the turbulence of the entire national situation, Western Hunan was the first to be chaotic before the world, and returned to the chaotic situation of ten years ago. Today's Western Hunan is full of flames everywhere, and the whole area is in turmoil.</p>
<p>Local Bullies Hold Great Power</p>
<p>The outbreak of this incident in Western Hunan was due to the 17th Pacification District's reorganization of local guns. There are many civilian guns in Western Hunan. According to unofficial statistics, there are more than 100,000. It is not unreasonable for the 17th Pacification District to want to use these civilian guns for the country. However, the technology was not thorough, especially ignoring the local forces here, and wanted to achieve its goal by purely political means. In other places, the people are afraid of the officials. With a simple order, it can be done. However, the situation in Western Hunan is not so simple. The civilian guns are in the hands of some local bullies. To put it mildly, this is to protect their own lives and property. To put it bluntly, they completely rely on these civilian guns to cultivate their own power in the local area. Now that the government wants to take them away from them, it is bound to arouse resentment. In the lunar month of last year, the 17th Pacification District sent personnel to Yongshun to order the local civilian guns (self-defense forces) to be reorganized into survey and construction brigades. The orders were swift and severe, and the county magistrate naturally obeyed the order. Cao Zhenya, the deputy commander of the self-defense general team (also the chief of the Yongshun police station), who held the power of the civilian guns, announced a rebellion.</p>
<p>The Wildfire Burns Endlessly</p>
<p>Before the Yongshun incident broke out, many counties in Western Hunan were already unstable. Huang Qi (the younger brother of County Magistrate Huang Yingchuan, who was killed in Dayong) in Baojing gathered thousands of people and guns out of anger that his brother's great revenge had not been avenged. Luo Bingwu in Guzhang also had more than a thousand people. Chen Zixia and Luo Yun in Longshan gathered hundreds of people. There was also a Hunan University student, Miss Tian Guang, who raised an army to avenge her father, Tian Hezhong, who was assassinated, and her army also had about six or seven hundred people. Hu Yan, a middle school student in Sangzhi. Long Feitian in Mayang has an even greater momentum. Cao Zhenya's actions in Yongshun were echoed by them, and they all rose up in rebellion, creating an all-out war. In the past few days, Mayang was the first to be captured by Long Feitian, followed by Yuanling, the heart of Western Hunan, which was captured by Cao Zhenya, and Luxi and Chenxi became dangerous cities. As of the time the reporter was writing, Pushi, a major town in Western Hunan, had also fallen. Wildfires burn endlessly, and the spring breeze blows again. The bloody Western Hunan is seen again today after ten years.</p>
<p>In response to the rebellion in Western Hunan, the provincial government decided to focus on appeasement rather than suppression, sending troops to suppress the rebellion on the one hand and sending provincial commissioner Dai Jitao and others to promote appeasement on the other. Dai is from Fenghuang. More than 20 years ago, he was like Cao Zhenya and others in Western Hunan today, and served as a division commander under Chen Quzhen. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he led his troops to fight on the battlefield and was more intelligent than other military men in Western Hunan. With his prestige, when he arrives in Western Hunan, juniors like Cao Zhenya will have to lower their heads. Everyone is eagerly hoping that Commissioner Dai's trip will not be in vain and that he will use the method of cutting off the fuel from under the cauldron to extinguish the wildfires in Western Hunan invisibly.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Police Bureau Handles Drug Case, Stages a "Catch and Release Cao"</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Wuxi 13th dispatch] Hou Zhenying, a female resident of No. 33 on the Bo'an Embankment in the city, was arrested by the Guangfu Gate police station on suspicion of drug trafficking. After being handed over to the city police bureau and then to the general bureau, she was released on bail on the grounds that Hou was seriously ill. However, all case files were transferred to the district prosecutor's office. The handling prosecutor, Shi Yanqing, believing that the main suspect in the case was out on bail and repeatedly failing to appear for questioning, which made investigation impossible, and that Hou Zhenying's claim of being extorted for three taels of gold jewelry should also be investigated, considered the case to be suspiciously like a "Catch and Release Cao" scenario. He issued a statement hoping that police officers would not fall into the trap of dereliction of duty and corruption.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Local Worthies and Famous Officials, Mountains Around Lanzhou Get New Names</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Lanzhou 8th dispatch] The suburbs of Lanzhou are all mountains. To commemorate local worthies, famous officials, and prominent figures of the Northwest, the Gansu Provincial Government has renamed the original mountains: Dragon Tail Mountain is renamed "Yinglong Mountain" (Zou Yinglong), Zhuzi Mountain is renamed "Xiaolan Mountain" (Ji Xiaolan), Boji Mountain is renamed "Chongguo Mountain" (Zhao Chongguo), Luohan Mountain is renamed "Qubing Mountain" (Huo Qubing), Shenjia Ridge is renamed "Pengze Mountain" (Pengze), Gouya Mountain is renamed "Yunjing Mountain" (source of the name unknown), Jiuzhou Terrace is renamed "Dingyuan Mountain" (Ma Dingyuan), and Baolong Mountain is renamed "Zhongqi Mountain" (Yue Zhongqi). Baidao Gou is renamed "Rongsi Mountain" (Duan Rongsi). As for Zhongzheng Mountain, Wuquan Mountain, Baita Mountain, Gaolan Mountain, and Xijinping Yanjia Ping, the old names will continue to be used.</p>
<h3>Teachers College Students on the Verge of Destitution, Staging Charity Play to Save Themselves</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Wuxi 13th dispatch] Since the Jiangsu Provincial Teachers College moved to Guangzhou under the Ministry of Education, public funding has been cut off. The entire college's 443 students are on the verge of destitution. To save themselves, they have decided to stage the play "Night Shop" for three days starting on the 18th of this month at the Wuxi Grand Theater, with all proceeds going to purchase grain for sustenance.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Third Self-Defense Platoon, Demands Back Pay Without Success, Creates Uproar</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Shaoxing 12th dispatch] The Third Company of the Self-Defense Regiment stationed in Ping Shui Che Tou (over 40 li from the city) under the Shaoxing County Self-Defense Headquarters suddenly mutinied at 9 PM on the 10th. Investigation revealed that the company had not received its January pay, and the hope of receiving February pay was even more distant. Although the third platoon leader, Zhang Zhiying, repeatedly requested the company commander, Yu Heming, to forward the request to the headquarters for payment, it was to no avail. This aroused the anger of all the soldiers in the third platoon. At 9 PM on the 10th, Platoon Leader Zhang ordered all the soldiers to gather and rush to the stationed location of the nearby First Platoon, disarming them all and abducting Chen Zhongqiao, the instructor of the First Platoon. The Second Platoon received the news and rushed to intercept them, but were unable to encounter them because they were traveling in opposite directions. The next morning, Chen Zhongqiao, the instructor of the First Platoon, escaped and came to the city to report to Lin Ze, who concurrently served as the commander, and Hou Zhuangyan, the deputy commander. Commander Lin, upon hearing the news, not only detained Company Commander Yu Heming but also ordered the police stations and requested the garrison troops to search and suppress the mutineers in separate directions.</p>
<h3>Hexi Water Conservancy Project</h3>
<p>— Our newspaper reporter Song Lin</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Lanzhou 9th dispatch] In order to rebuild Hexi and utilize the snowmelt from the Qilian Mountains to irrigate farmland, the Gansu Provincial Government is cooperating with the Hexi Water Conservancy Engineering Office of the Ministry of Water Resources for surveying and construction. This year, in addition to three engineering projects that still need surveying and design, funds must be requested for construction to increase wheat production by 500,000 shi. The construction and renovation of irrigation projects this year will be completed as scheduled. It is estimated that 490,000 mu of land can be irrigated, and wheat production can be increased by 500,000 shi annually. If small-scale water conservancy projects are included, 890,000 mu of land can be irrigated, and wheat production can be increased by 770,000 shi annually. The harvest is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>The current situation of the Hexi water conservancy project is as follows, with the more important ones listed:</p>
<p>(1) Shandan Baishi Cliff River, supplying drinking water for military horses and irrigation project: The location of this project is between the Shandan Dama Ying military pasture and the foothills of the Qilian Mountains. The pasture lacks water sources, and there are about 30,000 mu of uncultivated wasteland. It is planned to build a dam on the Baishi Cliff River to divert water to supply drinking water for military horses and for irrigation. The entire project has been designed. However, the Ministry of Water Resources did not approve it because it considered the project to be different in nature from other projects. The provincial government has now separately requested the Ministry of National Defense and the Northwest Military and Political Chief Executive's Office to allocate special funds for handling it.</p>
<p>(2) Shandan Interception and Diversion of Groundwater Irrigation Project: This is the most economical and simplest project to solve the water shortage in Hexi. Last year, a loan of 23.1 billion legal currency was obtained, and construction began in May. Approval was also obtained from the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Supplies for assistance funds, totaling 30 billion legal currency. Currently, 75% of the entire project has been completed. This year, it will be extended westward, and after completion, it can irrigate 6,000 mu of land.</p>
<p>(3) Jiuquan Zhongqu Fort Interception and Diversion of Groundwater Irrigation Project: Construction will begin in the spring, and after completion, it can irrigate 12,000 mu of land, increasing wheat production by 20,000 shi annually.</p>
<p>(4) Jiuquan Bianwan Interception and Diversion of Groundwater Irrigation Project: 10,000 mu can be cultivated and irrigated first in the spring of this year; the Jiabianwan small reservoir has been completed.</p>
<p>(5) Gulang Gutai Canal Renovation Project: A loan of 13.5 billion legal currency has been approved by the Ministry of Water Resources, and an additional 43,300 gold yuan has been allocated. The plan is to irrigate 8,000 mu first.</p>
<p>The remaining renovation project of the old canal on the Gulang Dajing River is underway. The renovation projects of Linze Wuyan Canal and Xila Canal have also been designed and sent to the Ministry of Water Resources for handling with American aid. The Bulongji Interception and Diversion of Groundwater Irrigation Project in Anxi outside the pass is in progress.</p>
<p>The raising of the spillway and repair project of the Yuanyang Pond in Jinta last year has been completed in its entirety, increasing the water storage capacity by one-third compared to before. This year, it can increase irrigation by 30,000 mu, bringing the total irrigation area to 130,000 mu, which can increase wheat production by 130,000 shi annually.</p>
<p>Huang Wanli, the director of the Gansu Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and concurrently the director of the Hexi Water Conservancy Engineering Office, intends to fly to Guangzhou in the near future to discuss matters related to Hexi water conservancy with the Ministry of Water Resources.</p>

<h3>Perspective on the 1,500+ Kilometer-Long Yangtze River Defense Line Between Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Our newspaper reporter He Xianglin</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Zhenjiang 13th dispatch] Due to the turbulent situation, with the overall situation unclear, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been blockaded since the 9th of this month. Passenger liners of various companies in Liuxu, Shierxu, and Guazhou in Zhenjiang have been ordered to suspend operations, prohibiting travel to and from the south and north. The entire river surface is in a state of silence. However, the people living in Zhenjiang are not panicking because of this. Today, the Yangtze River is undoubtedly facing a major historical test.</p>
<p>"Waiting but unable to return home" and "The spring river flows eastward" - these two lines of poetry perfectly capture the scene at the Zhenjiang wharf today. In the past, there were bustling crowds and the calls of stevedores, but since the full blockade of the river on the 9th, these have completely disappeared. Although many people on Pingzheng Bridge are craning their necks to look, what they see are a few warships docked in the middle of the river and the boundless river water, which makes people feel empty and lost. The First Pacification District Headquarters, in order to deal with the problem of ship import and export management, has established a ship management station in Zhenjiang by the river. The station began operations on the 10th, with Tang Xuejun, a technical specialist from the Department of Construction, serving as the stationmaster. He is actively carrying out his work.</p>
<p>Under the major principle that everything is for military purposes, the "river blockade" is of course necessary. Most things pass through without staying. Many materials need to be supplied from the north of the river, such as pork, vegetables, grain, and firewood. After the river blockade, prices have soared several times. In addition, many civilian ships and steamers are directly affected because they have stopped operating. Thousands of crew members and dockworkers are finding it impossible to maintain their livelihoods. The Steamer Association has convened an emergency meeting to discuss the issue of steamers stopped on the north bank of the river and requisitioned. The crew's food and coal consumption used to be subsidized by the military station, but now they have to handle it themselves. It was decided to add an extra 1.5 tons of coal per ship to maintain military transport.</p>
<p>Xie Bi, the magistrate of Zhenjiang County, is also very concerned about the source of materials and security issues after the river blockade. On the 11th, he urgently decided the following with Wang Youzhi, the city defense commander: (1) Passengers getting off the train at the station and planning to take small boats on the Jinshan River to cross the river north should be persuaded by the Provincial Police Bureau and the Transportation Control Station to disperse and not gather there to avoid causing trouble. (2) The business hours of silver shops are set to close before 6 PM. (3) Since the blockade of the river, the Chamber of Commerce and the Labor Union will discuss a number of unemployed workers and passengers short of expenses and submit detailed measures to request relief from the provincial government. (4) Zhenjiang firewood has always been supplied by the Shiye Zhou and Heshang Zhou across the river. Since the blockade of the river, the citizens' fuel supply has become a problem. Relevant units will formulate appropriate measures and request instructions from the provincial government. (5) The water and electricity company has only enough coal to last until the 15th. Although there are more than 100 tons of coal in Nanjing, they cannot be transported to Zhenjiang because the tugboats are blocked. It has been decided that the city defense headquarters will issue passports to rush the transport to Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>According to a military observer, the Yangtze River is a large river after all, and human wave tactics will not work. Therefore, the Communist army has to seek other strategies to cross the river. Generally speaking, their methods of crossing the river are: (1) Taking advantage of dark nights and high winds to carry out stealthy crossings. (2) Crossing while negotiating, making crossing the river a prerequisite for peace talks, and then discussing after crossing the river. (3) "Money can make the devil turn the millstone," using gold and silver as bribes to cross the river. (4) The hardline approach, directly attacking across the river. Looking at the four methods above: (1) Large-scale stealthy crossings are easily discovered by the navy and air force. Before they are used, they may be destroyed first, making it impossible for the Communist army to gather. If it is a sporadic stealthy crossing, the strength of this force is limited, and before it has a firm foothold, it is easier to be attacked jointly by the sea, land, and air forces. Therefore, the Communist army will not make this unwise move. (2) There is no shortage of talented people in the National Army, and they are well aware of such deceptive tactics. (3) The possibility is greater. If peace fails, the Communist army will only encounter unexpected setbacks. Looking at history from near and far, like Liang Hongyu defeating Jin Wuzhu, like Bai Chongxi defeating Sun Chuanfang, they are the best lessons from the past.</p>
<p>The Nanjing-Shanghai area is the political and economic center of the country, and its position is even more important than Beijing and Shenyang. If the Communist army were to obtain it, it would undoubtedly change the international situation. The National Army is of course very clear about this and is determined to defend this area. Now, on the 1,500+ kilometer-long coastal defense line between Nanjing and Shanghai, in addition to the strong security teams of Jiangsu Province, there are more than a dozen armies scattered there, garrisoning Nanjing and Shanghai, trying their best to control the bridgeheads north of the river. In the river, the Second Fleet of the Navy is defending, and there are large squadrons from the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea in charge of air defense. South of the Yangtze River, there are coastal defense sentry posts and surveillance posts monitoring. With such river defenses, although it is not a natural barrier, it can be said to be as solid as a rock.</p>
<p>In Jiangsu Province, the river surface is relatively narrow in Yizheng and Jiangyin. On the Yizheng riverside, firing cannons would threaten the vehicles on the Nanjing-Shanghai Road, but the National Army is still firmly defending Yizheng City. The Communist army has attacked fiercely several times but has not succeeded. In Jiangyin, more than a dozen wooden boats of the Communist army attempted to cross stealthily a month ago but were repelled by the navy. However, the terrain in these two places is poor, and the National Army has deployed heavy troops for defense. Shijiaqiao and Guazhou can shell Zhenjiang, but the garrison is firmly defending these positions. The Guazhou and Liuxu positions are strong, and there is no problem with defense.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the strength of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu, including local Communists, is about 400,000, and they are actively building wooden oar boats in large quantities in Yancheng, Gaoyou Lake, and Hongze Lake, having built more than 1,800 boats and equipped them with instruments and motors. The momentum is vast, and it seems that they are approaching the capital directly, but this is just a show of force. In fact, the Communist army's real direction does not show any signs of crossing the river in Jiangsu. This is just a feigned attack to coordinate and contain, attempting to shake the hearts of the people in southern Jiangsu.</p>

<h3>Finance Minister Xu Discusses with the Stabilization Fund Yesterday to Stabilize Shanghai's Financial Problems. No Concrete Decision Has Been Made, so the Contents Are Temporarily Not Disclosed.</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Xu Kan and Governor of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun continued their discussions at the Bank of China yesterday morning. Members of the Gold and Silver Stabilization Fund, including Xi Demao, Li Daonan, and Lin Chongyong, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, also participated in the meeting. They dispersed at noon. After the meeting, personnel from the area said that there had been no concrete decision, so they were unwilling to make any statement. The establishment of a public market for gold and silver, the technology for selling silver coins, and the brokers and organization of the gold and silver market are all issues of great concern to all parties. Reporters from various newspapers inquired with the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, but Mr. Lin was also unwilling to disclose anything. He only said that whether or not to sell is related to his work and cannot be told. Reporters repeatedly asked that since gold has a fixed price, silver dollars should also have a price. Mr. Lin replied that he did not know. However, it is generally speculated that the Central Bank will sell silver coins in large quantities after the official establishment of the gold and silver market. The establishment of the market will make it easier for the Central Bank to control gold and silver prices. Yesterday, the gold trading price had already fallen by 10% of the fixed price.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the National Bank continued to sell large quantities of gold and sugar to control the rise in prices. Today, in order to prevent price increases before and after the release of the cost of living index, the National Bank has decided to continue selling large quantities. At 10 AM yesterday, the Gold and Silver Stabilization Fund held a meeting at the Bank of China. Liu Gongyun, Xi Demao, Li Daonan, Chen Changtong, and Lin Chongyong all attended. During the meeting, the success or failure of the Shanghai sales policy was reviewed in detail. It was decided to continue using the policy this week to strike at illegal speculation and profiteering and rising prices.</p>
<h3>Money Market Fluctuates, Secret Interest Rates Around 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch] Yesterday's money market fluctuated uncertainly, entirely dependent on whether or not the National Bank sells various goods. The money market at the beginning of the day continued the tightness of the weekend, with day loans still standing at 110 yuan to 130 yuan. Subsequently, various industries saw the price charts and were attracted by the high day loan rates, so they sold goods to seek funds for lending, so the supply of funds gradually became abundant, and day loans also retreated to 80 yuan to 100 yuan. Near noon, most of the funds were settled, and the National Bank suddenly sold gold again. The market, fearing the repetition of last week's mistakes, did not want to fall again and did not absorb much. However, day loan rates began to rise again. Around 2-3 PM in the afternoon, they rose to 130 yuan again. However, it was finally learned that there were not many sales and the funds were limited, while disbursements from the national treasury and remittances from other ports continued to flow out, and day loan rates finally retreated to the 90 yuan-100 yuan range. Yesterday, national banks and bureaus had a shortfall of 12 trillion yuan due to the settlement of cloth and sugar from the weekend. Foreign firms had a shortfall of 70 million yuan, large clearing houses had a shortfall of more than 2 billion yuan, and small clearing houses had a surplus of 3.27 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Recently, the high level of secret interest rates in the market is quite alarming. On average, it is believed that secret interest rates are high every day, which not only proves the current state of inflation but also stimulates price increases. An executive of a money shop made a detailed calculation: based on a day loan rate of 50 yuan per 1,000 yuan, if 10,000 yuan is loaned out today, in five months, with principal and interest, 12.4 million yuan can be obtained. In the first month, 10,000 yuan plus interest can become 40,000 yuan. In the second month, adding interest again can become 160,000 yuan. In the third month, adding interest again can become 640,000 yuan. In the fourth month, adding interest again can become 2.56 million yuan. In the fifth month, adding interest again can become 12.4 million yuan. This loan interest rate is much higher than before the war. It is heard that the Financial Management Bureau is currently trying to prepare to curb and improve the situation.</p>
<h3>Gold Merchants Resuming Business Registration, Guild is Rushing to Handle</h3>
<p>Likely Cannot Be Completed This Week</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch] According to the situation of preparations in various aspects, the establishment of a public gold and silver market in this city will have to be extended to the end of this week or the beginning of next week before there is any sign of progress. The Gold Businessmen's Guild continued to handle the resumption of business registration for members yesterday. More than 60 old members have gone to collect application forms, but none have been filled out and submitted yet. In order to have further discussions, the guild plans to hold another meeting of directors and supervisors at 3 PM today to complete the necessary preparations for the eve of the resumption of business. According to a spokesperson of the guild, the resumption of business by the guild members this time, according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, refers to the original members, so new members are not being considered for the time being. Judging from the current situation of members applying for registration, it is too early to say that the resumption of business can be completed within a week.</p>
<p>Financial authorities also hope that the deadline for the establishment of the gold and silver market can be realized within this week. However, it is reported that this still depends on the extent of the guild's preparations. As for whether the Central Bank will sell newly minted silver dollars on the market, it is impossible to give a definite answer due to the confidential nature of the matter.</p>
<h3>Customs Yuan Converted to Foreign Currency</h3>
<p>Calculated According to the Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate. The National Bank Does Not Issue Customs Yuan Notes Separately.</p>
<p>The implementation of customs duties in Customs Yuan has been ordered by the Jianghai Customs in this city and began to be implemented yesterday morning. The Customs Commissioner summoned the relevant departments and responsible workers yesterday morning to discuss the techniques and procedures for implementation. According to the person in charge of the customs, all preparations for the customs to collect customs duties in Customs Yuan have been completed. When goods are imported and declared, the customs will determine the amount of customs duties to be paid. Then, the importer will directly pay the money to the Tax Collection Office of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank. The customs itself will not directly collect taxes. It is expected that customs revenue will increase sharply after implementation.</p>
<p>According to news from the Central Bank, the exchange rate between the Customs Yuan and gold, silver dollars, gold yuan, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars has been determined by the National Bank and is generally calculated according to the Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate price. One Customs Yuan is equivalent to 40 US cents. 50 US dollars is equivalent to one tael of gold, which is equivalent to 125 Customs Yuan, equivalent to one tael of gold. The National Bank does not issue Customs Yuan banknotes separately.</p>
<h3>Circle Inside Money Market Still Buoyant, Chinese Stocks Plunge All the Way Down</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Chinese stock market yesterday first showed a flat trend before weakening, with a period of stability in the middle. Near noon, frequent negative news from outside the circle made people feel insecure, and the market showed signs of not being able to hold up. Early in the morning, news was heard that the money supply was initially reported to be easing, with unofficial interest rates outside the market opening at 80 to 85 yuan. The central bank's allocation price remained at the original level. With the impending release of the cost-of-living index, the market slightly increased due to the consideration of buying more at cheaper prices. Near noon, news spread that the central bank was still dumping gold in large quantities, causing gold prices outside the circle to plummet. Various markets all rebounded near closing, while the money supply felt tight, and the market went all the way down. Yong'an Cotton Yarn opened at 5.65 in the morning. After opening, short positions covered, and more scattered buyers absorbed the supply, pushing the price up to 5.75 at one point. Securities firms assisted in selling, causing it to drop again to 5.57. Financial and yarn firms then absorbed the supply again, raising it to 5.75. Subsequently, the price fluctuated around this level, with no clear winner or loser. By 11:30 am, the market price of gold gradually declined, quickly retreating near the 300,000 mark. Cotton yarn advanced and retreated rapidly, causing a soft trend to emerge, and the market went all the way down, with bids retreating to 5.45. After the low, the money supply became extremely tight, and there was still active selling in the market, causing a slight rebound to 5.40 yuan. The market ultimately closed at 5.225 yuan.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks opened relatively flat. After opening, they slightly increased before quickly declining. Near noon, they all closed at lower prices. Meyer opened at 1.60 yuan, rose to 1.67 yuan, fell to 1.38 yuan, and closed at 1.43 yuan at noon. Xinhua, Jingfu, Qinxing, Zhonghua Fire, and China Porcelain all opened slightly higher before closing lower at noon. The remaining stocks were all weak, with a total transaction volume of 3,185,336,000 shares.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign stock market was weak due to lackluster news. Jardine Matheson was bid at 10,009 yuan and 11,001 yuan. Asia was bid at 1,050 yuan and 1,070 yuan. Wheelock Marden had sellers at 32,000 yuan. British American Tobacco had buyers at 12,000. The remaining stocks were quiet.</p>
<p>Trading in gold bonds was sparse, with both bulls and bears showing little interest. Prices slightly increased, opening at 175,000 yuan in the morning and rising to 177,800 yuan later, closing at 180,000 yuan at noon, and remaining at 180,000 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll: Spectators</h3>
<p>The Central Bank's Confidence: Playing It Stronger and Stronger; Giving Gold Bonds a Boost</p>
<p>In the recent week or two, the speculative market seems to have become the financial authorities' pliable tool, allowing them to dictate its ups and downs.</p>
<p>The big fish eat the small fish, which is the law of nature. In the market, whoever has the bigger capital is the winner. With the central bank's printing presses, they have an inexhaustible source of capital. As long as they are willing, what can't they do?</p>
<p>Therefore, the financial authorities have recently been able to dictate the market's movements, making others go long or short as they please. Thinking about the principle of the big fish eating the small fish, it's not surprising at all. What's surprising is why they were helpless in the past. Could it be a difference in intelligence? Only heaven knows.</p>
<p>It seems that the financial authorities are also very confident in controlling the market. Therefore, they are playing it more and more boldly. Last week, it was widely rumored that the gold and silver markets could reopen this week. Although the rumors came a bit early, they are indeed true. Not only are they true, but the authorities' eagerness is even more urgent than the speculative friends who are interested in it. This shows that the financial authorities' confidence is getting stronger day by day.</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, the market's sluggishness in the past week was due to the natural trend of the mid-month situation. The real test of their power should be the control forces in the coming week.</p>
<p>It's one thing not to talk about the gold and silver markets, but once you mention them, it feels incredibly wonderful.</p>
<p>Everyone is concerned about the news of the reopening of the gold and silver markets, hoping for higher gold and silver prices in the future. In fact, everything remains the same. The reopening will not balance the market. Looking at the past, even though the authorities have shown their ability to control the market, the price increases of various goods have always kept pace with interest rates, which is very clear.</p>
<p>Gold and silver merchants are excited about the permission to reopen the gold and silver markets. However, they are all hesitant about the issue of security deposits. It is said that each person must pay 100 gold bars. This amount was not considered large before the war, but it is not small now. Moreover, if merchants pay physical goods to the authorities as security deposits, what guarantee can the authorities give to the merchants? Some people have suggested that the market be responsible for safekeeping the security deposits itself, but the market authorities do not have a safe place to store gold, and no one dares to take on this responsibility.</p>
<p>In fact, the authorities' eagerness to open the gold and silver markets early has other intentions. Because they know that it is difficult for merchants to pay physical goods as security deposits, they still want to maintain the standard of 100 gold bars per person to leave room for bargaining. In the future, it is very likely that the security deposit will remain at 100 gold bars per person, with no concessions. However, the condition of paying physical goods may be changed to paying gold bonds. The market price of gold bonds is half the price of physical gold, which is equivalent to reducing the security deposit by half. Wouldn't this give gold bonds a boost for the merchants?</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Slightly Rebound Near Noon Amid Central Bank Sales</h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday was still soft, with the central bank continuing to dump gold, disheartening the bulls. The initial price opened at 333,000, 338,000, then rose to 340,000, 345,000. Afterwards, it fluctuated around 335,000. Near noon, the central bank sold again, causing extreme fear. There was frequent selling, and short sellers followed, causing the market to rebound. The price fell to the edge of 300,000. After the low, the money supply became very tight, with underground interest rates reaching 125 yuan to 140 yuan. The floating longs could not bear the burden, and selling continued. The market closed at 295,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan at noon. The futures market opened at 325,000, 330,000, then rose to around 330,000 in the mid-session. After 3 pm, it rose to around 335,000. At 4 pm, it rose to 341,000. After the high, new shorts rose again, and the price quickly returned, retreating to around 335,000. The market closed at 335,000, 337,000.</p>
<p>The opening price of U.S. dollars was 6,700 yuan, 6,800 yuan. The price fluctuation in the middle followed the rise and fall of gold. The noon closing price was 5,900 yuan, 6,000 yuan. The afternoon opening price was 6,500 yuan, 6,600 yuan. Afterwards, the price gradually rose, reaching a high of 6,800 yuan before falling back to 6,700 yuan, 6,750 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Stabilized</p>
<p>The opening price of Hong Kong dollars yesterday morning was 6.95 jiao per 1,000 yuan, the same as the closing price on Saturday night. The opening price of gold yuan notes yesterday morning was 1.20 yuan per 1,000 yuan, the same as the closing price on Saturday night.</p>
<p>The opening price of Hong Kong gold yesterday morning was 304.5 yuan, while the closing price last weekend was 305 yuan. The opening price of U.S. dollar telegraphic transfers yesterday morning was 5.21 yuan. The opening price of U.S. dollar banknotes yesterday morning was 5.17 yuan, while the closing price last weekend was 5.21 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit, Stagnant Sales, Rice Prices Slightly Weaken, Flour Prices Decline, Oil Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>Rice prices showed a downward trend due to tight credit. Sellers were eager to sell because of high underground interest rates, while rice shops were reluctant to buy. Sellers initially wanted to maintain the original price, but ultimately lowered it due to sluggish sales. The North Market's white japonica and thin indica rice were priced at 36,500 yuan, a decrease of 500 yuan from last Saturday. Premium japonica rice remained at 39,000 yuan. In the South Market, japonica and indica rice each decreased by 500 yuan, but the market remained stagnant until closing, and prices continued to fall. The total amount of rice arriving at the two markets was 73,333 shi.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices fluctuated erratically. Due to tight credit, prices fell early in the morning. They briefly struggled to rebound, but ultimately declined due to reported losses from outside the industry at closing. Soybean oil opened at 142,000 yuan, briefly rose to 148,000 yuan in the mid-session, but returned to 143,000 yuan at closing, a decrease of 4,000 yuan. Crude rapeseed oil closed at 138,000 yuan, a decrease of 5,000 yuan. Jilong crude oil fell by 9,000 yuan. Sesame oil and tea oil each fell by 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake fell by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>With tight credit, the number of buyers of flour decreased sharply, and prices declined. Sellers from the north began to sell at the opening, followed by factories. Old chariot flour opened at 15,300 yuan and fell to 15,150 yuan at closing. The price ultimately fell to 15,000 yuan due to the decline in gold prices, a decrease of 650 yuan from last Saturday morning. Battleship flour ultimately fell to 14,400 yuan, and Red Bee, Jiancheng, and others each fell by 600 to 700 yuan. Bran was sluggish and had no outlet.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains all trended downward. With tight credit, there were more sellers than buyers. Both factory and customer appetites for soybeans were maintained, and the price fell by 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts fell by 5,000 yuan. Corn and red sorghum each fell by 1,000 yuan. Sesame also fell by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan due to the oil factories' lack of demand.</p>
<h3>Promissory Notes in Circulation, Financial Authorities to Investigate</h3>
<p>The circulation of promissory notes among merchant associations has recently become very popular. This has had a significant impact on credit expansion. In light of this, the financial authorities previously advised various merchant associations to reduce the issuance of such notes to avoid affecting the market and to facilitate the associations' own operations. It is now known that some small and medium-sized merchant associations have largely paid lip service to this advice in order to please their clients. The financial authorities are paying close attention to this matter. It is reported that a centralized investigation will be conducted to effectively tighten credit and stabilize the market.</p>
<h3>Imported Overseas Orders Decline Compared to Previous Week</h3>
<p>According to the Import Management Committee, a total of 90 import applications for overseas orders that have been paid for were received in the first week of this month, totaling over 420,000 U.S. dollars, a decrease of one-third compared to the previous week. The method of applying for import of these overseas orders has been in place for 18 weeks, and a total of 1,664 import applications have been approved, totaling 1,138,232 U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Tea Market Stable and Firm</p>
<p>The tea market's rising trend has continued unabated since its rapid advance. This is due to the scarcity of tea stocks, which has stirred up people's emotions. At the same time, the market continues to build on the latent strength from last week's prices, which were still considered insufficient. Therefore, sellers immediately shouted for higher prices at the opening, and the market rose sharply. The trend briefly stabilized in the middle due to the tightness of funds in the industry. However, the market showed no signs of instability and remained firm as before. Internal sales of tea were mainly from shops in this area, with some additions. However, sales in Suzhou, Wuxi, and rural areas were sluggish due to rain. As for exports of boxed tea, the rapid increase in prices has gradually caused them to be higher than foreign tea prices, causing demand to weaken and trade to be minimal.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Declines</p>
<p>The tung oil market, which had been advancing towards new peaks, completely changed its appearance yesterday after the opening, frequently trending downward. This was because the pressure from the authorities' sale of materials and tightening of credit had gradually affected the industry. Sellers suddenly began to sell in large numbers, and buyers took the opportunity to suppress prices, causing the market to retreat. By closing, prices had fallen by more than 10,000 yuan compared to the previous week, but trading was still active.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes and Soap Market Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the cigarette market was cautious due to the continued tight credit situation, and sellers slightly loosened their grip. However, actual sales from shops were still strong, and the market rebounded. At closing, Yizhong's high-end cigarettes were slightly firm, while the rest were flat. Large daily necessities merchants lacked the strength to raise prices, and all parties remained on the sidelines. The market was flat and weak. Gu Ben was at 55,000 yuan, Jian Dao at 50,000 yuan, Xiang Mao at 35,400 yuan, Mei Li matches at 230,000 yuan, and Fenghuang matches at 220,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Fall, Cotton Cloth Sales Become More Severe</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn lacked the strength to rise. The market opened with a firm sentiment, and high prices were quoted for various yarns. Subsequently, the tight credit situation in the market continued, and the prices of goods outside the circle were all flat and weak. Actual sales were also sluggish, and trading in the market was very quiet. Sellers were unwilling to hold on and were generally trying to sell their goods for cash. However, new buyers were reluctant to step forward, and the market gradually declined.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fell from 2,720,000 yuan all the way to 2,510,000 yuan at closing, a decrease of 60,000 yuan compared to the weekend. 140-count Blue Phoenix was down 70,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon also decreased by 60,000 yuan, closing at 1,640,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 1,310,000 yuan and briefly rose to 1,360,000 yuan. However, due to scattered shorts and Guangdong merchants being forced to cover their positions, there were many hedging sales, ultimately closing at 1,220,000 yuan, a decrease of 50,000 yuan. Factory orders ultimately traded at 2,215,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse slightly decreased by 20,000 yuan. The sales of the remaining 16-count and 10-count coarse yarns were also sluggish, and market prices followed the decline.</p>
<p>The cloth market rose and fell. Due to the tight credit situation in the industry, trading in the market was quiet. Business in the street shops was dismal. Only a few merchants from Guangdong and Hubei made small purchases. Scattered shorts, pressured by high interest rates, sold off their positions. Various cloth prices slightly increased after the high, resulting in a slight increase. Longtou fine cloth opened at 49,200 yuan and briefly rose to 51,600 yuan, but soon retreated and ultimately closed at 48,800 yuan, an increase of 2,300 yuan compared to the weekend. Laba Tong fine cloth increased by 2,200 yuan. Sijunzi yuan bieji opened at 47,500 yuan, with the highest price reaching 48,500 yuan in the middle. Near noon, scattered shorts flooded the market, and the selling pressure was strong, causing the market to quickly turn downward, ultimately closing at 46,400 yuan, an increase of 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Other Sijunzi yuan zhigong and Yao Li yuan guangxie also showed slight gains. State-owned factories generally increased their opening prices by about 50% compared to Saturday. 190 high-end Shilin broke through the 100,000 yuan mark.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Weak</h3>
<p>The raw silk market dropped sharply yesterday. The credit in the market was still buoyant, and the shadow interest was high and then low, with people's minds weakened. No. 120 Dongyang immediate futures opened at 1,710,000, and the market lifted it, once reaching 1,760,000. When it came to the close, I heard that gold had plummeted, and people's minds were weak. At noon, the current day's position was as small as 1,620,000, and the next day's position was 1,765,000, small 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw silk was initially slightly stronger in the morning because the credit was slightly looser and the foreign exchange certificate opened higher in the morning. The high-end Linyong initially shouted 265 yuan, and at noon, the gold price outside the circle plummeted, the positions were all tight, and the shadow interest rate was raised. The market was constantly selling, and the market rebounded slightly, eventually closing at 2,500,000.</p>
<p>The silk market was initially seen as strong yesterday because the credit was slightly relaxed. Meyer's opening was lifted because the chips in the market were still small, and the opening was shouted at 1,185,000 yuan. Later, it rose 30,000 yuan, and then fell back at noon, eventually closing at 1,165,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Keelung Coal Prices Adjusted Again</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Taiwan exchange rate was adjusted to one to six, the Keelung coal price of the Four Mines Joint Venture was adjusted to 92,830 yuan yesterday, an increase of 9,610 yuan compared to the previous price.

However, neither of the above two ships was seen in Shanghai at 6 pm yesterday. It is likely due to bad weather, and it is expected that they will arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>How to Rationalize Import and Export Trade: Import and Export Merchants Association Expresses Opinions on Financial and Economic Proposals</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the announcement of the financial and economic reform plan, the reporter has repeatedly visited the person in charge of the local Import and Export Commercial Association to ask for opinions. According to the report yesterday, the opinions on the part of the plan related to import and export trade are as follows:</p>
<p>More than half a month has passed since the government announced the financial and economic reform plan, and the detailed rules for implementation have not yet been announced. These detailed rules for implementation are the specific methods for promoting this plan, and all parties are extremely eager to see them. Here are some views on the part of the plan related to import and export trade, for the reference of the authorities in formulating the detailed rules for implementation or revising the plan.</p>
<p>First of all, the possible effects of the plan on import and export trade can be divided into positive and negative aspects. In terms of positive effects, the authorities' import and export trade may be able to operate flexibly. That is, after the implementation of the plan, (1) due to the reduction in the types of goods for import quota allocation, huge institutions such as the Import and Export Management Committee can be abolished. Moreover, after being approved by the Supervisory Yuan and requested by the Executive Yuan, importers can reduce various roundabout procedures such as applying for permits and visas, which will facilitate the import trade. And due to the exemption of visa procedures, the cost of visa fees can be reduced, which will reduce the cost of imported goods. This is especially beneficial to the industrial streets. (2) Due to the abolition of the restrictions of Central Bank Notice No. 170, the regulations stipulate that foreign exchange transfer certificates can be freely transferred in order to import goods from abroad, which will make the price of transfer certificates close to the actual situation, and may have a positive effect on export trade. At present, the foreign exchange required for import relies solely on export foreign exchange, so what is beneficial to export is a beneficial factor for import.</p>
<p>As for the possible side effects of the plan on import and export trade, that is, the negative effects, there are the following two items. That is, (1) due to the conversion of customs import duties to customs yuan, smuggling in South China will inevitably increase, and in fact, the new situation of smuggling in South China is already in the process of forming. After the implementation of the plan, except for a small number of restricted, prohibited, or temporarily suspended imported goods, the rest can be freely imported. However, due to the conversion of customs import duties to customs yuan, goods that can be freely imported will also be smuggled in order to reduce import costs. Moreover, due to the increasing trend of smuggling in South China, the financial purpose expected by the plan, hoping to increase fiscal revenue by converting to customs yuan, will inevitably be difficult to achieve due to the reduction of formal imports. What's more, the economic situation in Central China is rigid, and imports will be difficult to increase. (2) Due to the opening of imports, the production of various related industries in the country may be adversely affected. However, this shortcoming may be compensated. That is, generally speaking, future imported goods may be divided into (A) goods allowed to be freely imported, (B) goods temporarily not allowed to be imported, and (C) goods prohibited from being imported. In order to compensate for the above shortcomings, it is hoped that goods allowed to be freely imported can be slightly stricter. And it is hoped that more goods can be listed as temporarily not allowed to be imported in order to achieve the effect of protection.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the import and export trade part of the plan, food, cotton, and fertilizers are listed, and the government will formulate separate measures for handling them. It is hoped that detailed and more reasonable measures can be announced in the near future. And it is hoped that the use of free funds will be allowed for import. As for the export of yarn, it is also hoped that restrictions can be relaxed. It is also hoped that the overstaffed institutions such as the Cotton Yarn Export Committee and the US-aided Cotton Yarn Joint Purchasing and Sales Office can be abolished. In addition, after the huge institutions such as the Import and Export Management Committee are abolished, it is hoped that a reasonable institution for coordinating import and export trade decision-making can be established, and that industrialists and businessmen can be allowed to participate.</p>

<h3>Exciting Basketball Tonight: Ren Yu Reunited with Encars, Hai Qing to Battle Pfeiffer Again</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] There will be exciting games in the basketball league tonight. Ren Yu, which has risen to second place in the league, will meet Encars on a narrow road. The outcome of this battle will have a significant impact on Ren Yu's future. Ren Yu's basketball skills are improving rapidly, and Encars has also made great progress in the second round. This will undoubtedly be a wonderful game. In another Group A1 game, Pfeiffer and Hai Qing, two American teams, will compete for a barrier. The opening game in Group A2 will be Movie Star vs. Mao Xun. Ticket prices remain the same, listed below:</p>
<p>You Yi vs. Mao Xun (Group A2) 5:30 pm</p>
<p>Pfeiffer vs. Hai Qing (Group A1) 6:30 pm</p>
<p>Ren Yu vs. Encars (Group A1) 7:30 pm</p>
<p>The Final Showdown: Ren Yu Reunites with Encars According to Group A1, there are four Chinese teams and four Western teams. Recently, among the Chinese teams, only Hua Lian has suffered one setback and has the greatest hope of winning the championship. Hui Li and Hu Jing have both lost four times, tied with Encars. Ren Yu, on the other hand, has won six and lost two games, showing great momentum. Winning tonight would solidify their second place. Otherwise, Encars will surpass Hui Li and Hu Jing and approach them directly. Ren Yu has achieved brilliant results in this competition, thanks to the combined training and guidance of the coach. Xu Zhongyi has returned from overseas, and Cai Jindian has joined to assist Chen, strengthening the team's strength and improving their basketball skills. Encars was originally a giant among Western teams in Shanghai, but their results in the first round were mixed. In the second round, they made great efforts, and Hui Li and Hu Jing suffered at their hands, and their old enemies were avenged. Although the team leader Engeney has left Shanghai, the meteorology team leader Bo Shou Shengge has been promoted to join the battle. Bo Tou is extremely brave, and between Burton, Peng Qigu Fu, he is like a tiger with wings, making people feel afraid. Ren Yu was humiliated in the first round and has endured it until now. Now that they are reunited on a narrow road, how can they be willing to give in? Moreover, it is related to their future. The heroes of the two teams will show their skills and fight to the death. Let's see who will win and who will lose.</p>
<p>The opening game is You Yi vs. Mao Xun, and the latter has a good chance of winning. You Yi is composed of movie stars, and they are not as good under the stage lights as they are under the mercury lights. Since their debut, they have lost both of their two games. Tonight, they will meet Mao Xun, a perennial winner in the group, which has good players such as Zhuo Guanzheng and Sun Jiawen. The rest of the players are also brave and good at fighting. However, soldiers are afraid of pride. Mao Xun will not take the enemy lightly, and winning three games in a row is a matter of course.</p>
<p>The next game is Pfeiffer vs. Hai Qing again. When the two teams met for the first time, Pfeiffer lost by one point with a score of 42 to 43. This is their chance to take revenge, and they will do their best. The team has never won in the first round, but the situation has changed greatly in the second round. They defeated Hua Lian and broke Maylings, avenging two old enemies. The team is also playing better and better, with Keller and Montenegro playing at their best, and the black charcoal Brown is accurate in shooting, making him a dangerous person. Hai Qing was lucky to win last time, and they will try to defeat their strong enemy again to maintain their reputation. However, the team has already lost three times in the second round, and their morale has been stimulated. A bloody battle is inevitable tonight.</p>

<h3>Sports World Basketball League Division One: Four Chinese Teams Still Leading</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In the Division One basketball league, the four Chinese teams are still in the lead, followed by the four foreign teams. Although Wah Luen suffered one defeat, they still lead the pack. Yan Yee has risen to second place. Because Ernest has won consecutively in the second round, while Shanghai Police has not been as successful, Hweili, Shanghai Police, and Ernest are now tied for third, each with five wins and four losses. McKinnons and Hai Ching are improving with each game. The outcome of the second round is still uncertain. The win-loss situation of each team is listed below:</p>
<p>Division One Standings</p>
<p>Team Name Games Percentage</p>

<p>Pellifel 8 2 .250</p>
<p>Hai Ching 9 2 .222</p>
<p>McKinnons 9 2 .222</p>
<p>Because there are many teams participating in the Division Two league, the scoring method of the 14th World Games basketball tournament is used to determine the win-loss ranking. First, they are divided into four groups, A, B, C, and D, and a single round-robin tournament is held. The top one or two teams from each group in the four groups will hold a knockout tournament to compete for first to eighth place. The third and fourth place teams in each group will compete for ninth to sixteenth place. The fifth and sixth place teams in each group will compete for seventeenth to twenty-fourth place. The single round-robin tournament in each group is progressing smoothly, and more than half of the schedule has been completed. The stage of win-loss determination has not yet arrived for each group. Except for groups A, B, and C, which are relatively clear, Group D has equal strength, and there is still fierce competition. The standings of each group are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Taiwan Provincial Rugby Tournament to be Held Starting on the 25th</h3>
<p>[Taipei Air Mail] The Taiwan Provincial Rugby Association, in order to promote rugby and arouse the public's interest in sports, has decided to hold the third annual provincial rugby tournament on the 25th, 27th, and 2nd of this month. It is reported that all organized teams can participate, and they are divided into two groups: social group and middle school group. The tournament will be held at the Taipei Park Stadium in this city.</p>
<h3>Development of English Football in the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 11th] According to Barriskill, a spokesperson for the United States Football Association: Football has been quite popular in the United States recently. This summer, British professional football teams will come to England to participate in competitions. While stationed in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, American soldiers will compete with local English football teams and gain good experience. When they return to their country, they will have become good football players. Currently, there are more than 50,000 players in the United States who have joined the Football Association. Every Saturday, more than 40,000 people watch football in New York. From last September to this June, there were more than 200 teams participating in football matches in the United States. The future of football as a sport is very promising in the United States.</p>

<h3>British Sports Emphasize Business Acumen</h3>
<p>[British Information Service] Sports will make a significant contribution to the British economy in 1949. Many British factories are now manufacturing many kinds of excellent sports equipment, and only one-third of them are supplied for domestic needs. Although this quantity has increased a lot compared with the domestic supply ratio a year ago, it is still far from the domestic demand before the Second World War. However, the balance of supply and demand is gradually developing. At present, fabrics and leather are still scarce in the domestic market because most of these goods are completely used for export.</p>
<p>The British horse racing habit can also be regarded as an export business. Foreign horse breeders' respect for British horse breeds is increasing. This can be seen from the demand for purebred horses in all aspects. Since the end of the war, this demand has not only not decreased but is increasing. British horse racing celebrity Lord Rosebery believes that this demand will not diminish. He firmly believes in the purity of British horse breeds, and his opinion has given horse breeders a new incentive to increase exports.</p>
<p>The British sporting spirit is also a major "export commodity." We can clearly see this from the World Games in London last summer. Every program in the World Games has a strong attraction for overseas audiences. University rowing competitions, England-Scotland football matches, tennis matches held at Wembley Stadium, and outdoor golf leagues all fascinated tens of thousands of travelers to Britain last year. These many sports programs constitute an unforgettable picture of British customs. The sports season this year is coming again, and those who come to visit again this year can enjoy it again.</p>
<p>Many foreign tourists will come to Britain for their first trip. They will be able to visit the British Industrial Exhibition held in London and Birmingham in May. In last year's exhibition, sports equipment occupied an important and quite eye-catching part. Many of the exhibits were not seen in British stores after the Second World War. These things are exquisitely made and are completely exported. British sports enthusiasts will be able to buy them only after a few months. This is part of Britain's self-sacrifice to increase exports. A sports equipment merchant told me after visiting last year's exhibition that when he saw so many important equipment all used for export and not sold domestically, his envy and covetousness were indescribable. The equipment made by British manufacturers is really diverse and all-encompassing, making domestic audiences feel a little overwhelmed. Sports clothing and shoes are also available in all kinds of complete sets. Of course, this year's exhibition will be no different, but there will be more new samples, and the inventory in some departments will be more sufficient for people to choose from. The quality of all kinds of goods is the most important. Although the British domestic market will benefit from the increase in production, foreign merchants will get the best quality goods. They will be able to see the best quality, excellent structure, and durability.</p>
<p>Sports activities will also make overseas visitors to Britain dazzled. London's football matches will be held grandly to entertain the people who come to Britain for the meeting. It is estimated that the audience for each match will reach 90,000. Other activities such as cricket will also be popular throughout the UK, so people who come to the UK in May can not worry about not having a ball game to watch. (Written by Piddington)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Football News: China Motor Bus Will Compete for Second Place</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Air Mail] Last weekend, there were six matches in the Hong Kong First Division Football League. The results were:</p>
<p>South China South beat Navy Team 8-0</p>
<p>Eastern beat South China China 5-2</p>
<p>Army Team beat Air Force Team 1-0</p>
<p>Chinese Team beat Kitchee Team 3-2</p>
<p>Bus Team beat Hong Kong Club 3-2</p>
<p>St. Joseph's beat Police Team 5-2</p>
<p>It is said that South China South made its sixteenth expedition, and its power remained the same. The sailors were not good, and they received eight duck eggs, and there was no tense scene in the battle. The performance was relaxed. Not only did the people watching laugh, but the people kicking also kicked more and more happily. It can be said to be a good show of swimming dragons playing with phoenixes. It was not that South China South played well, but that the Navy performed particularly badly. South China South's forwards kicked out eight people, how could the Navy's defenders cope? A white boundary line was drawn into two battlefields. On this side, "Liang De" had few cars and horses in front of the goal. In the 70-minute game, only five people officially received the ball. Kam Hung guarded the center road, with the heroic demeanor of Yi De guarding Changban Bridge in those years. The sailors could not enter at all. Hou Zi and Shu Ling guarded the two bridgeheads, like iron walls, allowing Liu Song to often perform the heroic act of running horses and shooting money. On that side, Pei Lie fumbled and messed up. Gan Huali and Duosha were busy with business. In the first half, they still had the work of resisting, and they only lost two goals. In the second half, the entire army was wiped out, and half a dozen eggs were scored, which made the audience smile.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the two major highlights were that the Bus Team won against the Hong Kong Club, and the Chinese Team luckily defeated the Kitchee Team. The scores were both 3-2. The competition for the league runner-up is still neck and neck. It remains to be seen next week who will win. So far, the Chinese Team has four more points than the Bus Team, but the points lost are equal. The Bus Team has played two fewer games.</p>
<p>The Chinese Team defeated Kitchee by 3-2. From the process, the Chinese Team won by luck, because at least two of the three goals scored by the Chinese Team were given away by Kitchee's inner guards. In the second goal of the first half, Mo Jinsong did not see clearly that there were two Chinese forwards at the same time beside him, but lightly headed the ball into his own goal, which was beyond Zhang Guanxing's expectation. In the second half, Lu Huasheng's single-handed goal was caused by the mutual mistakes of You Huaxing and Li Bingzhao.</p>
<p>However, the morale of the Chinese Team was high, and Kitchee's lack of Yao Zhuoran was also the main reason for this victory and defeat.</p>

<p>The Bus Team has already reached the edge of the runner-up. In order to win the victory, in the battle against the Hong Kong Club, all the elite were sent to the field. Tan Junqian did not come because of something, and Sun Binan put on his battle clothes again after the B group game, which can be regarded as responsible. He saved a penalty kick, which made the Hong Kong Club unable to take the lead and greatly affected the morale of the army. The front line Li Chunfa and Qian Chihui were out of shape, otherwise they could have won two more goals. Deng Yijie forgot to bring his shooting shoes, and his requests were not answered. Zou Wenzhi and Li Dahui were heroes, one goal each. The central defense line Kong Qingyu and Deng Sen performed at a high level. The pair of defenders Tan Zhenhui and Mai Linfu were not top-notch, and there were loopholes everywhere, which was the Bus Team's hidden danger. Hong Kong Club's defense and offense were balanced. Chia Neng was the soul of the whole team, giving the Bus Team a lot of threats. Hua Liu was still qualified to guard the middle road. The goalkeeper was "Huang Maozai" Jia Dang, who was extraordinary yesterday and saved many dangerous balls, but Hua Liu's penalty kick failed, and Xiao Fula made an "own goal" once. The 3-2 loss was a bit wronged.</p>

<p>In the battle between St. Joseph's and the Police, St. Joseph's did not come because Gomes was absent, and Xu Jingcheng was injured and retired. Moreover, only nine people were enough to play at the beginning of the game, and later barely made up the number of people. It was generally believed that the Police could win this battle, but unexpectedly, the Police's performance was not satisfactory, and Joseph's, however, fought with mourning soldiers and won 5-2, which was beyond everyone's expectations.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Haircuts</h3>
<p>— Martin</p>
<p>Since the cost of a haircut exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark, I often don't dare to step into the barber shop when I touch my pocket. After procrastinating for several weeks, yesterday, my hair was so long that it was too unsightly, so I had no choice but to go in. Fortunately, it is a well-known and correct thing for men to be afraid of haircuts, and it is not necessarily all because they cannot afford the money; so when I sat down on the barber chair with this long hair, I was not ashamed.</p>
<p>Once I sat down, hypnotized by the buzzing sound of the electric hair dryer around me, I couldn't help but start daydreaming:</p>
<p>The profession of barber has always been quite enviable, because there are fans in summer and stoves in winter, and there is no suffering from the scorching sun or wind and rain. Moreover, both hands have to kiss the tender face and neck of a beautiful woman, and the other party will never get angry, which is still the rest. But I think the dignity of the barber is not in this; but in the mood when you lie down and let him sharpen his knife, shave your face and beard, and your power to live or die is tied to his one thought. I often think, what if this barber has a slight mental problem and is occasionally confused and cuts off the trachea with a knife, wouldn't it be over? Although such things do not happen often, it is still very dangerous that one's life is only tied to his one thought. I don't know how people like Hitler, who prevent assassination, are strictly guarded everywhere, with detectives everywhere, will deal with this haircut; I think his royal barber must be very confidant, or his brother-in-law, one unknown. In Chinese history, there have indeed been times when barbers wielded the power of life and death. Not to mention the distant past, as in the near past, when the Manchu Qing entered the customs, in order to force people to shave their long hair and change to barbarian costumes, the barbers were封ed as "waiting edicts" of the palace. When they saw old or young people with long hair on the street, they could be forced to shave it, otherwise? "Keep your head but not your hair, keep your hair but not your head." Its prestige can be imagined.</p>
<p>Even in foreign countries, although there is no news of killing heads by imperial decree, it is well-documented that barbers used to be surgeons. The rotating red and blue cylinder in front of the barber shop is said to have originated in Huanzhou, probably Italy, because there is no book at hand and cannot be checked. In short, at that time, people generally believed that if there was a problem, as long as a blood vessel was cut and a little blood was released, the poison would come out and the disease would be cured; the meaning is the same as that of the old people in the Chinese countryside today who have a fever, as long as someone scratches red marks on their necks, they will be fine. In Italy, the work of cutting blood vessels was done by barbers. The red and blue stripes on the cylinder, red represent arteries and blue represent veins, etc. Since blood vessels can be cut open, can't the throat be cut off? Thinking of this, one can't help but feel terrified.</p>
<p>Therefore, I admire the courage of those who are willing to go to the barber shop often. In the past, in the Qing Dynasty, when sentencing prisoners, big thieves were executed, and accomplices were often beheaded together, that is, they were tied to the execution ground together, and they were not notified in advance. They saw the heads of the people next to them being砍ed off, but they were still taken back. This was used as a warning, which was said to be very effective. Then today, lying on the barber chair, seeing the bright, cold razor scraping on one's throat, wouldn't one feel the danger of being murdered at all times; and dare to enjoy it and go to be killed often, how can one not admire one's courage?</p>
<p>Although barbers wield the power of life and death, there is one thing that is quite regrettable. That is: his own head will also have to be handed over to someone else to shave. Tailors can make clothes for themselves, and painters can paint their own houses, but only barbers cannot do it themselves, and still have to ask other barbers for advice. From this, I also realized that those who control the lives of others, their own lives are often in the hands of others, the so-called mantis catching cicada, oriole is behind. Things in the world circulate, mostly like this, "Please see the barber, people also shave his head"!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I had finished my haircut, stood up, and although I paid 1,700 yuan, I felt that I had realized a great truth, and I felt that this trip was not in vain, and I felt relieved.</p>
<h3>On Human Transformation</h3>
<p>— Wang Deyun</p>
<p>Now, most poor public school employees and clerks are probably not so-called "fitters," so it is simply difficult to "survive." In order to "adapt to the environment" and not be eliminated by society, it seems that there is a great need for "transformation."</p>
<p>Of course, the brains of poor guys cannot be "transformed," which may be "innate mental retardation," so there is no need to discuss it, and it is better not to mention it. At present, what urgently needs "transformation" is the human body's eyes, mouth, stomach, and legs. Because this is really related to life, it is no small matter. If scientists can move to "transform" the minds of the poor people, then I would be extremely grateful. Now I will record my humble opinions for reference, I hope you will appreciate them:</p>
<p>(1) Eye transformation - it is best to transform it into a cat-like eye, so that you can see clearly at night without turning on the lights, so that you can save a sum of electricity bills. Originally, it was too extravagant for poor people to even have to use electric lighting equipment.</p>
<p>(2) Purpose transformation - it is best to transform it into a tube shape, and have sand filter and sterilization functions, so that you can always find drinks anytime and anywhere, even if you often drink black water from the Suzhou River, it doesn't matter. - Is tap water expensive? You can also ignore it.</p>
<p>(3) Stomach transformation - it is best to improve it so that you don't have to eat human food, as long as you breathe a little air, you can survive, this is of course very difficult, but I also ask scientists to help.</p>
<p>(4) Leg transformation - it is best to improve it so that it is stronger than the legs of the Sahara ostrich, and you can run hundreds of miles without caring, then wouldn't it be great? Then, whether the tram is charged in Guan Yuan or US dollars, it has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>The above four points of "transformation" are actually "current urgent matters," which are more important than any new financial and economic policies. I hope that scientists will work together to study and find ways to improve successfully, then the common people will be fortunate.</p>

<h3>Utter Misfortune</h3>
<p>A person fell into the river and was washed away by the waves. The neighbor went to tell his wife and felt very sorry for the chicken:</p>
<p>"Madam, I bring you very bad news. Your husband drowned."</p>
<p>"Ah, what! His new Parker 51 was also in his bag!"</p>
<h3>Snake Tamer</h3>
<p>— Zhang Hongxiang</p>
<p>Mrs. Wiley is from Kansas, USA. She is a middle-aged woman with black hair, blue eyes, a slender figure, and a gentle and courteous demeanor. Her conversations often include many scientific terms, while she refers to those deadly killers—poisonous snakes—as her "little darlings." For twenty-three years, she tamed two cobras with the title of "Snake King," in addition to a rattlesnake, a bamboo viper, a small cobra, three copperhead snakes, several large pythons, and over a hundred other extremely venomous snakes. Mrs. Wiley began reading books about moths and butterflies in her teens, collecting specimens while reading. Later, she studied entomology at the University of Kansas and decided to study insect animals. In 1922, after graduating from university, she took one hundred dollars to Texas to collect specimens, but ended up bringing sixty-five rattlesnakes back to the university's museum. Later, she worked at the Minneapolis Natural History Museum for fifteen years. In 1938, she voluntarily resigned and decided to start the largest private zoo in Hollywood. Mrs. Wiley's current income comes from renting snakes to film companies and frequently holding public exhibitions with ticket sales.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wiley discovered that Hollywood lacked snake handling talent, so sometimes, in addition to renting out venomous snakes, she also had to play the role of snake charmer in films. Once, a film required a white cobra, but none of Mrs. Wiley's snakes were white, so she had to personally paint a layer of white paint on the snake's body. When she tamed the two large cobras, she recorded everything in her diary. On August 26th, she received the two "Snake Kings" shipped from Singapore. They were initially very aggressive, hissing, jumping up to three feet high, and biting and entangling anything they could reach. In the four days after August 30th, her diary stated: "Today, I tamed them for the first time with an eighteen-inch rubber stick." The third day, it read: "Use my bare hand to grab the cobra's tail."</p>
<p>September 4th: "Today, I used my bare hand to grab the female Snake Queen, pried open its mouth, and fed it with my fingers."</p>
<p>September 6th: "Both venomous snakes are tamed, and I can now direct their movements."</p>
<p>Two months later, her diary read: "This is also a very strange thing! In my experience, the most venomous and dangerous snakes in the world are the easiest to tame."</p>
<p>Mrs. Wiley is indeed a snake taming expert. She knows the nature, needs, and reactions of snakes. Although she is so meticulous, she has been bitten by venomous snakes several times, but each time she always blames herself because she violated her own sacred rule.</p>
<p>This sacred and precious rule, which seems very ordinary and commonplace on the surface, is: "Quiet, calm, never negligent, bold but precise. If an unexpected unfortunate event occurs, then immediately freeze or make a swift retreat."</p>
<h3>Can There Be Complete Honesty Between Husband and Wife?</h3>
<p>— Baozhu</p>
<p>Sincere treatment and openness between husband and wife are great principles that have been considered appropriate throughout history and across cultures. But is it possible to be too straightforward, too honest, and without any pretense? The facts tell us "no." Here are two stories, which, although like jokes, are common occurrences:</p>
<p>A couple felt that there was hypocrisy between people in society, and even the closest friends were not honest enough. But there should not be this "false" character between husband and wife, so they decided that in the future, everyone should be honest about everything. One day, the husband asked his wife to personally cook him a steak. The wife was not good at cooking, but she happily spent a lot of time making a steak for her husband. The husband was very grateful, but after cutting for a long time, using all his strength, he only cut off a small piece. After taking a bite, it was so salty it was almost bitter. So he thought he should honestly tell his wife: "This steak you cooked is really too bad, it's so hard and salty, it's like a stone pulled out of a salt jar." As soon as the wife heard this, she immediately pulled a long face, snatched his plate, threw it into the kitchen, and muttered: "No one was happy to cook for you in the first place. If you want to eat well, why don't you go to a fancy restaurant?"</p>
<p>Another newlywed couple also agreed to tell each other the truth. The husband liked to paint, so he went to learn painting in his spare time. Not long after, he brought back a portrait to show his wife and said with a smile: "What do you think of my masterpiece?" As soon as the wife saw it, she burst out laughing: "What is this? It looks neither like a person nor like a ghost, but like a monkey." The husband was very unhappy and still unwilling after a while: "You don't understand art at all. The professor at school said I was doing well!" "I don't understand art, I'm not good enough for you," the wife immediately retorted: "Why don't you marry someone who understands art?" As a result, the two quarreled all afternoon, and the wife angrily went back to her parents' home, where she stayed for a week before being persuaded to return by her family.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't advocate that couples should perfunctorily deal with each other. Too much perfunctory behavior and hypocrisy will lead to a lack of true feelings. At the same time, desperately trying to imitate Europeans and Americans by always praising one's husband or wife is also not our custom. For example, if George's wife bought a bright red dress one day, wore it home, and showed it to him, the gentleman would show a very surprised look and say: "GE! Darling! You look so beautiful in this dress. Even the most beautiful female movie star in Hollywood can't compare to you." In reality, this wife weighs at least one hundred and eighty pounds.</p>
<p>In some places, under certain emotions, a wife or husband being slightly "fake" will only increase feelings and not cause harm. At least no wife wants her husband to call her a monster because her rouge is a little too red; nor does any husband want his wife to say he looks like a criminal because he hasn't shaved for several days.</p>
<p>Why do even couples need to have a little hypocrisy? The reason is very simple: because everyone is born with self-esteem, a love of beauty, a desire to excel, and a desire to be appreciated. These natural tendencies cannot be eliminated by the relationship of husband and wife, lovers, confidants, or even parents and children.</p>
