<h3 id="c1">北大西洋公約公布　聲明決以集體武裝行動　抵抗歐洲北美任任何侵略 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十八日電〕國務院宣布：北大西洋公約全文一千零四十字，定於星期五標準時間下午四時（上海時間同日午夜零時）公布，被邀於四月初來此簽訂該約之國共計十二國。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十八日電〕北大西洋公約之內客已於今日在美·英·法·加·荷·比·盧·挪·八國首都公布，參加之八國，（冰島·丹麥·葡·義四國大致亦應邀參加）聲明決以集體武裝行動，反抗在歐洲及北美任何處所的侵略，必要時得使用武裝部隊以對抗此等侵略。八國並同意於發生對於任何一簽字國的土地元整，政治獨立或安全之威脅時，入國得從事協商以謀對策。關於採取集體行動以排除侵略之規定，見之於該約第五條，其中聲明於發生任何攻擊，及因此而採取以恢復或維持北大西洋區安全的措施，均應呈報聯合國安理會。各簽字國並應組織執行本約之委員會，其組織方式應以得以隨時迅速開會為原則。公約中並特別聲明本約之簽訂並不影響聯合國安全理事會為維持國際安全及和平所負的責任，公約第八條特保證現存的國際條約，如英蘇·法蘇條約等不因本約之簽訂而受影響，本約第一條明示本約各簽字國於一致同意時得邀請得以促進本約原則及有助於北大西洋區安全之歐洲任何他國參加本約。本約於多數簽字國將批准文件存交美國政府之時起生效。本約施行十年後，經任何簽字國之請，得由全體簽字國協商延長十年。施行滿廿年後，任何一簽字國得於一年前通知退出該約。（公約全文刊第三版）</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十八日電〕具有歷史性之北大西洋公約將使西方反共產各國團結一致，重整軍備，以防來自蘇聯或其他方面之攻擊。該約公布後，將引起穌聯與世界各地共產黨領袖之重新非難，與西方各國之熱烈討論。該約簽字元成後，僅需大多數簽約國議會批准卽可付諸實行。但該大多數簽約國必須包括美·英·法·加·比·荷·盧七國在內。另據杜魯門總統與國務部長艾契遜宣稱，北大西洋條約不過美國四大外交行動之一，第二步行動將在咨請參院批准該約同時提出十億元軍事援助西歐法案。</p>
<h3 id="c2">北大西洋公約公布之日　中共配合莫斯科　廣播號召反對世界新戰爭 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中共電台昨日廣播中發表新華社社論，以「全世界和平力量動員起來」為題，强烈號召全中國人民積極參加世界各國人民反對新戰爭危險行動，呼籲各人民團體推選代表出席四月間的世界擁護和平大會，「粉碎戰爭挑撥者陰謀」。文中抨擊美國與蘇聯拒絕和談，並拒絕關於裁軍與禁止使用原子武器建議。並謂「美帝國主義是我們的死敵，蘇聯是我們的戰友，蘇聯首先廢除帝俄不平等條約，並以實際行動援助中國抗日，紅軍粉碎日本精銳的關東軍，促使日本投降」。對中蘇條約關於旅大決定，乃「對帝國主義的重大打擊，是對中國人民的和平保障」。中國共產黨於歐洲北大西洋公約內容公布之日發表此項廣播，頗為各方人士所重視，一般認為中國共產黨於此時會，發出國際性的和平呼籲，顯與第三國際莫斯科總部行動相配合。據此間國際時局觀察家意見，北大西洋公約將於四月四日在華盛頓正式舉行簽字儀式，預料民主集團國家與極權共產主義勢力將進入一新階段，蘇聯為反攻起見，自必將號召其衛星國家，發動新的攻勢。昨日中共發表之新華社社論中，明白指責「美國帝國主義正在積極準備新的世界大職，全世界一切愛好和平的人們，必須動員起來，反對新戰爭的危險，祇要全世界一切愛好和平的力量團結奮鬥，戰爭危險完全可以克服」·東北及華北共產黨控制區，最近對反美及反對美國援助國民政府，以及指摘麥克阿瑟扶植日本對抗蘇聯，其行動已棘趨積極。據可靠方面消息稱：中共對於太平洋形勢問題，曾作縝密檢討，預定擬以渡江之軍事行動，與歐洲局勢相配合。據謂中共方而與草斯科接近之首腦人物，力主渡江，以武漢廣州為進攻目標，期與東南亞共黨勢力合流，造成西太平洋之赤化，以與美國相對抗。另一派共產黨主要人物，認為欲元成「中國革命」，應先以京滬之國民政府的心臟部份為進攻對象，藉圖擊敗國軍統一中國後而使亞洲局勢改觀。而一般認為不論中共採取何項決策，均相信長江以北共軍，其整編補訓工作，至遲當於本月底以前可吿完成，而於四月初旬發動其渡江攻勢，期與西太平洋緊張局勢遙相呼應。此種行動，顯已漸為國際人士所注目。昨日中共電台中明白而又公開介紹史達林在一月卅日與二月二日兩次關於願意與美國總統杜魯門會談的聲明，並强調法國共產黨領袖都力司，義大利共黨領袖土格利亞蒂，與各國共產黨關於反對新戰爭危險的聲明，呼籲中國人民，「對於世界和平力量的號召　　，毫無疑問要努力支持，中國人民一定要積極參加，反對新戰爭的行列」。據稱：中共方面將推派代表參加四月召開之世界擁護和平大會，『以中國人民自己的信念」，與世界人士共合作，相信「美國帝國主義一定可以被戰勝，新戰爭的危險一定可以被克服」。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕監院全體委員對目前政治之意見，已於十八日下午于·劉兩院長招待何院長茶會上向何氏提出，其重心共分：（一）加强改革決心，（二）加强進步團結，（三）愼重決策，樹立政府誠信，（四）選任賢能，（五）整肅綱紀，（六）厲行法治，嚴懲貪汚，（七）促進和平等七點。招待會係於下午四時在國際聯歡社舉行，參加監委九十餘人，何氏於四時正如時蒞止，首與各監委一一握手，旋卽入座，由于·劉兩氏先後起立發言，謂何院長組閣伊始，監院適於此時集會，各監委來自各地，把地方情形帶至中央，各地方對何院長之希望，各監委亦可陳述。繼卽由谷鳳翔·劉平江·陳雲閣等就所提之七項意見作口頭說明，谷氏特別强調今日國家危險異常，何院長受侖於危難之際，如不痛下決心改革，則今日之危機卽不能挽救，如能改革，始可起死回生。至團結與進步，更為今日所必需，但團結者應為進步之力量。革命之人士，而非對於派系之敷衍，谷並指出，過去由於政策不穩定，朝令夕改，以致民怨沸騰。劉平江提出：「決定國策·知人善任·權責分明·賞罰為公」十六字為內閣閣揆之責任，希望行新政·用新人，對於過去貪汚有據及無政績者，應擯斥於內閣門外，並特別提出財長人選應愼重選擇，不能再用財閥，否則定將失敗，而對於過去紀綱之廢弛，軍紀政風之敗壤，尤痛言必須整頓。陳雲閣謂，促進和平已為全國一致之呼聲，不管戰爭有何理由與需要，在此全國人民均妻離子散之情形下，人民對戰爭實已無法忍受，只有謀致和平，始為人民之需要。繼復有格桑悅希，孫玉琮，曹德宣，祁大鵬等發言，孫特別鼓勵何院長本身應具有改革決心，與勇氣，立·監兩院決支持進步之何內閣。曹德宣慨慷陳詞，謂欲整肅紀綱，必須自懲辦徐蚱會戰失利之指揮者劉峙及不戰而棄瀋陽之衛立煌開始，對於前行政院長孫科亦應加以懲辦。曹並提出和平應有限度，贊成備戰言和，反對罷戰乞和，訂對於局部投降式之和平，則應堅決反對，並主張和戰應由國民大會決定，茶會迄五時半始散。</p>

<p>謂決盡力爭取和平</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕何應欽院長，十八日下午在監院于右任院長劉哲副院長招待會上，親自宣稱渠所組織之新內閣，為一和平內閣。渠決盡力爭取和平，改進人民生活，謀取國家建設，以增進人民之幸福。內閣閣員亦正根據此方向從各方物色中，決本選賢任能之旨，以網羅眞正人才。惟因目前時局艱危，賢能者多不願貿然入閣，故尙須多方敦請，閣負名單尙不能早日公佈。何氏指出今日之時局艱困，必須羣策羣力，始可挽救危局，並呼籲監委及立委多多協助支持，共渡難關，完成使命。何氏目承渠之受命組閣，乃跳火坑之舉，明知為火坑，何以又肯去跳，乃因鑒於現在民不聊生，人民苦不堪言，必須謀求和平，加以拯救。日本投降以後，余卽認為戰爭是殘酷的，當時卽請政府派至安理會工作，促進世界和平。彼時余在美國到處演講，主張和平，認為世界已經過兩次大戰，以後不應再有戰爭，而聽到那時國內正在舉行政治協商會議，解決國內問題，卽感覺甚為興奮。何氏對於其組閣經過，亦曾於會上追述，謙稱渠自民元參加辛亥革命以來，始終從事軍事工作，對于政治工作，甚少研究，並缺乏經騐與幹部。曾一再堅辭，但經李代總統派吳禮卿先生等多次挽勸，始允勉為其以，一切多無凖備。近日來忙於組閣，施政方針尙未暇擬訂，對于監委之建議，決提供將來內關同人共同參考。何氏態度誠懇，頗博得監委一致之好評。于右任院長於何氏發言後，起立作結語稱：「他不跳火坑，那一個能跳火坑？相信何先生一定能引導我勿走上光明的大道」。招待會卽　於熱烈鼓堂中結束。</p>
<h3 id="c9">新閣人選羅臻難　理想人物仍在多方謙辭　全部名單今晚或可決定 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕新閣籌組工作，顯已遭遇極大困難，何應欽氏雖以極大勇氣與毅力，從事努力，但均缺少成就。何氏十八日曾對記者談：渠以邀約各地人士入　，連日與穗滬通長途電話，聲帶已近沙啞。並連稱困難甚多。何氏之理想與目的，在於閣員地位之超然，與富於相當之資望，及儘量避免用舊人。但截至十八日止，其邀約之對象，幾十之九均已婉謝，是以何氏不得不改就新人方而考慮。同時其考慮之對象，亦不得不漸次降低水準。京中政界人士，在此種期待中，對何氏之努力極為佩服，但對其成就，則均拘消極。目前入閣一事，已為一般人視為「跳火坑」，如新人均無跳火坑之勇氣與決心，勢將轉而延攬舊官僚，則何內閣原有之理想，自當大打折扣。何氏對人對事態度，均極誠懇，此點頗能避免其因組閣遲緩可能遭遇之物議。何氏頃仍每日與李代總統見面，報吿並商討人選問題。十八日午三時，卽往謁談一小時始出。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕據極可靠方面消息，新閣名單至十八日晚，尚未確定。連日報章所載人選，雖各有根據，但多為正接洽中者。該方面透露，如無意外變化，全部名單，十九日晚可望作最後決定。惟發表時恐在廿一日，因國民黨籍之副院長，須經中常會通過，部會苜長須經中政會通過。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨是否參加新閣，迄昨尙未決定。該黨昨日在滬曾召開中常會，張君勱因病未出席，因會內意見不一致，未作結論，決議將各種觀點彙齊，送請主席張君勸決定。蔣勻田亦卽日赴京，徐傳霖今可由穗飛滬。再靑年黨中常會昨日議決，不參加何內關，而徒旁竭力予以支持，並由該黨宣傳部長王師曾，對此發表書面聲明。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕前行政院長孫科以機密費名義向中央銀行動支一億一千萬元案，監委倪弼·何濟周·喻培厚等提出糾舉案，業經審查成立。茲誌全部案由·事實及理由如下：</p>
<p>案由：為行政院長孫科妄支鉅額國帑，化公為私，亟應咨請總統嚴予處分，立卽追回全部公款，並送司法機關依法訴究，以彰法紀，而肅政風案。</p>
<p>事實及理由</p>
<p>查中央銀行於本年二月十五日接到財長徐堪同日密函，內稱：「奉行政院孫院長二月十日令開：「着卽墊撥院長機密費一億一千萬元，以應急需等因，自應遵辦，相應函請貴行如數墊撥，見復為荷」。當日卽由財部總務司長羅宗文出給臨時收據，取得中央銀行當日業字七五一六號一億元來人本票一紙，業字七五A一千萬元本票一紙，卽日將該項機密費一億一千萬元如數領訖。次日卽二月十六日，由中國實業銀行將一億元本票提出交換，轉入該行甲活存帳號五二三七八孫治平戶（孫科之子中國實業銀行官股黃事）。並於當日以支票十四張，共支去八千零一十九萬元。其中轉入五三一一〇永成戶四筆，計四千四百萬元。由華茂銀行提出交換一筆，一百萬元。付現九筆，計三千五百一十九萬元。而永成戶之存款由該戶當日開出支票十五張，計四千四百零三萬九千二百元，均係私家銀錢企業。中國實業銀行又於二月十七日以支票五張，共支出二千二百零一萬六千四百零四元六角，綜合兩日以支票十九張，共計支出款項一億零二百二十萬零六千四百零四元六角。另中央銀行一千萬元本票一張，亦於二月十六日由安裕錢莊轉入該莊往來戶三四〇八趙季豪戶（該號係經營元春股票號），卽於當日提出，分別進入重慶·春茂·綢業·生大·恒大各行莊調申請書，及福華烟公司，信孚記食糧行等戶。綜合以上情形，可以斷定孫科憑藉權位，妄用機密費名義，密向國行動支鉅額國帑，化公為私，事實已臻明確。當此國本飄搖，民生凋敝，而一般公敎人員顚沛流離，呼號載道之際，孫科身居首揆，悍然不顧一切，妄支鉅額國帑，化公為私，實全國公敎人員莫大之恥辱，卽應咨請總統嚴予處分，立卽追回全部公款。其貪汚凟職罪行，並應送交司法機關，依法訴究，以彰法紀，而肅政風』。</p>
<h3 id="c14">重慶號飄遊渤海　行動難逃海總控制範團　如不來歸最後將被炸沉 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕重慶號巡洋艦，正在海總控制範圍內，是否予以炸沉，數日後當可揭曉。其所在地點，目前所可披露者，不在蘇聯控制之旅順港內，亦不在大速港，此事足以說明蘇聯對於有痕跡之對中共連系，當不欲合作，故中共於接受此龐大之叛艦後竟有手足無所措之驚喜反應，其處理亦陷入慌張而無法狀態。旣極欲收容，又恐此艦由原班人馬中不同意叛變之校尉駛逃政府區。在烟台港數日中，一部份魯籍水兵，自願還鄕，去黃縣龍口。其後共軍決派三百名左右精銳共軍，登艦協助，遠離烟合北駛。該艦最後命運，恐將如黃安號，但在其沉沒前，海總仍在竭力以電波呼喚，企圖召歸此一王牌。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕黃安號驅逐艦，係一千噸小艦，二月十二日自靑島出走後，卽無法獲知其下落。嗣於三月十四日，由空軍派空運機載該艦艦長劉廣超等，在東海岸偵巡，經在連雲港外，發現此灰色小艦。當日第一批前往投彈之飛機，故意在該艦四週投彈，迫使該艦順從，聽命南歸。不期該艦人員恐南歸受處分，於飛機離空後，駛艦入連雲港南碼頭靠岸，人員旋卽登陸逃避。至此空軍知引該艦南返無望，故十五日出動飛機，輪番轟炸，將該艦右舷之甲板及艦尾烟囪等部炸中，使該艦傾斜，半沉半豎。按海軍出走軍艦，僅黃安號與重慶號兩艘，外電所傳七艘，不確。</p>

<h3 id="c17">社論　從大西洋公約說起 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>醞釀已久的大西洋公約，已定於下月四日在華盛頓簽字成立了。發起該公約的英·美·法·荷·比·盧森堡·挪威·加拿大等八個國家，且已聯名邀請丹麥·冰島·葡萄牙·義大利四國參加簽字儀式，不要說丹·冰·葡三國的欣然應邀，是毫無問題的，就是義大利也已克服了義共的橫加阻撓，決定如期派員前往華府參加了。這個大西洋公約雖屬區域安全機構性質，但其含義之深刻而廣大，誰也不能否認的。</p>
<p>我們站在第三者的立場，觀察這個公約的內容及其作用，不能不說是英美在冷戰中對蘇聯的一大成就。預料大西洋公約簽訂之後，必將有其他區域安全性質的公約相繼誕生，土耳其所企求的地中海聯防公約，英國所倡導的太平洋公約或東南亞聯盟，都有成為事實的可能。但英美在外交上步步進攻，咄咄逼人，勢必引起蘇聯的嚴重反響，而加深世界危機的惡化。</p>
<p>合眾社十六日倫敦電稱：歐洲已患着很沉重的戰爭恐怖症，大家都有一種感覺，認為蘇聯的外交危機正在形成之中。這個抽象的報道，雖不免有「危言聳聽」之嫌，但亦不致全是捕風捉影之談。我們綜合了最近國際上的動態，可以列舉以下幾項事實來證明此說的不謬。第一是西歐聯盟五國（英·法·荷·比·盧）已成立了一個總防衛計劃，一面由西歐五國儘速重整軍備，一面要求美國供給武器。其中尤以英國積極擴充空軍，最惹人注目。第二是保加利亞和匈牙利，在蘇聯的默許之下，不顧對保對匈和約中的軍事條款，積極擴充其軍隊；羅馬尼亞現有的軍隊，也已超過和約規定的限額了。第三是伊朗將廢棄，九二一年的蘇伊條約，而將與美國締結軍事聯盟，決心與西方國家共存亡。第四是土耳其的國會也一致支援其外長薩達克的親英美政策，而且薩達克外長擬於日內赴華府，與美國朝野商訂地中海聯防公約。</p>
<p>上述各項事實，無一不顯示出今日世界大局的嚴重性。世界各國的人民，受了第一第二兩次包辦大戰的浩劫，雖一致企求和平，渴望安定，但客觀的事實，舉竟和這個人類共同的願望，似在背道而馳，離開和平更遠，卻向戰爭一步近一步。由西方國家說來，不論是西歐聯盟的組成，大西洋公約的簽訂，地中海聯防公約的締結，都是確保區域和平與安全的一种自衛計劃，僅止於自保而已，初無針對他國而具有侵略性質。但在世界兩極化日趨明朗的今日，西方國家在歐陸，近東暨地中海上所作種種的安排，由另一方面看來，不啻芒刺之在背，不是想設法打破西方國家在各處的安排，就是想自己在別處也來一個安排，以抵消對方安排的作用。記得正當挪威當局考慮是否與西方國家共同發起大西洋公約的時候，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫曾向挪威建議締結蘇挪兩國互不侵犯條約；又當義大利當局研究是否接受西方國家的邀請參加大西洋公約的時候，義共受了新共產國際的指使，橫加阻撓；再如正當西方國家在歐洲造成有利形勢之際，蘇聯便在亞洲積極造成她有利的形勢。諸如此類，無一不足以說明，今日的世界正在兩種勢力的鬥爭之下，如能勢均力敵，造成力的平衡，則世界和平或尚可苟延殘喘，保持一個時期；反之，如其若失去了平衡，則慘絕人寰的國際戰爭恐難免爆發，就更在眼前了。</p>
<p>從這個角度去觀察，大西洋公約的簽訂，雖可謂英美在外交上的一大安排，造成國際上絕對有利的形勢；但天下事往往窮則變，如果追着蘇聯走頭無路，則國際上頗有發生大變化的可能。遠處不必說，且看近處吧，今日的亞洲已變成什麼樣子了？緬甸首都已成孤城，危在旦夕，英印如不能予以有效的援助，緬甸恐怕也就是變色了。他如馬來·暹羅·越南·也有着同樣的危機。英美外交家對於大西洋公約的簽字，或許認為是一種外交的勝利，在那裏洋洋得意，殊不知在美國重歐輕亞以及漠視中國戰事性質的錯誤政策之下，由中國共產黨軍隊的勝利起，亞洲的危機已日益深化，此即英美忙着在歐洲安排所造成的惡果。我們希望英美外交家正視現實，高瞻遠矚，望到全球，速謀對策，以填補在亞洲的這個極大漏洞。否則將來自食惡果，後悔無及！</p>

<p>〔本報漢口十七日電〕中紡公司副總經理吳味經，日前來漢視察，十七日午轉湘公幹。據吳氏行前談：中國紡織業已面臨嚴重危機，其最大原因，為原料不足，電力不敷，就目前各厰存棉言，距離新棉登場時至少尚差四個月的用量，一旦原料供應中斷，則不僅間接影響全國軍民服用，且將直接使滬上從事棉紡織業之員工七十餘萬人陷於生活絕境，深望產棉區軍政當局珍惜物資，鼓勵運銷，以期共渡難關，尤盼國共雙方顧及民生疾苦及工業建設之艱難，勿使僅存之陝鄂棉區再遭后燹之禍。</p>

<h3 id="c34">簽約國和平如受嚴重威脅　美國決取堅強行動　大西洋公約內容公佈後　艾契遜國務卿晉嚴正表示 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十八日電：艾契遜頃在記者招待會中說明其對北大西洋公約之見解稱，如參加北大西洋公約之西歐國家遭遇攻擊時，美國當即參戰。渠強調稱，依據該公約，美國應執行該約之義務至何種程度，仍應由美國國會作最後決定。艾氏稱，如簽字國遭遇全面攻擊，如法國在一九一四年及一九四〇年所遭遇者，簽字各國應各憑其誠摯之判斷，決定究應採取何種恢復和平及安全之必要步驟。艾氏稱，如各國確認為必須應用武力，則此亦即為公約之義務。艾氏并稱，根據該約，美國依法應作若干事項，雖無人能強迫美國採取任何行動，但渠确信美國必能實行其所簽訂條約中之諾言。艾氏并明白指出對簽約國攻擊及所謂邊疆事件之不同，并舉例謂我人決不用巨鎚擊一蒼蠅，故日本擊沉潘奈輪時，美國不採行動，惟日本攻襲珍珠港時，美國即採強有力之運動。我人固不能在某一事件發生之前，即預言其重要性之程度如何，但必須某一攻擊確已威脅被攻擊簽約國之和平及安全，始能採取堅強行動。渠以為純粹之國內革命，不能認為武裝攻擊，但此種革命如受外來力量之協助，則情形又屬不同。但根據公約第四條，任何簽約國如自以為政治獨立及安全受威脅時，其他簽訂國之義務僅為應即舉行協商，不一定採取行動。艾氏并於答問時稱，渠以為空運物資至柏林之飛機在經過柏林蘇佔區上空遭受攻擊時，應視為本公約中所指之武裝攻擊，根據渠之判斷，此舉已為攻擊簽約國之佔領軍。</p>
<p>艾氏并稱，如此約所指定區域以外之地區遭遇攻擊，而簽約國蒙受影響時，各簽字國應根據第四條之規定進行協商。但第五條所規定之行動（包括軍事援助）則不適用於本約所指定區域以外之地區。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十八日廣播：參院外委會主席康納利稱：北大西洋公約將由參院迅速批準。康氏并稱：所謂「迅速」者，意謂經參院詳盡聽取報告及辯論之後。康氏稱：「吾人參加北大西洋公約之目的，係為覓致和平，并對一切國際爭執以和平及合法之方法求其解決，而不訴諸戰爭。今公約內容能早日發表，則可使國人於參院採取任何行動之前，先能明瞭其條文。」範登堡及該委會其他委員則表示須先加詳細研究，然後再加評論。眾院外委會主席季約翰則謂：渠以為內容尚欠堅強，渠認為該約已使各國負起道義的責任，但渠本人則希望能有一種真正的有約束性的責任。另一眾院外委會委員曼士斐爾稱：該約可使聯合國機構發生若干變化，而成為一力能實現世界和平之組織，眾院外委會委員共和黨議員富爾登則認為該約過分着重軍事，而對經濟及社會方面分量太輕，并對該約所需之款項頗表關注。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕大西洋公約最切實的措施，當為　立防務委員會，其實此一委會的核心機構今已存在，即設在華盛頓之美英加聯合參謀部，美國參加二次大戰前即已成立迄今之美加聯防局，及根據白魯塞爾公約所設之西歐聯盟永久性軍事組織。</p>
<p>此三機構之任務聯合以後，大西洋公約之防務委會預料於公約簽字之際即可成立，俾於公約經各國准許後，該令即可展開工作。其即時任務，不外：（一）決定大西洋公約各國之總軍力；（二）各國在此總軍力中應行負擔之部份及美國應行供給之援助；（三）如何使新參加國加入該防委會；（四）各國如何履行立法上的程序以實施前項措施。此外大西洋公約所將引起的問題，重大者將有西德·奥國·特港之地位（因公約簽字國在各該地有佔領軍之設）及簽字國之一借用簽字國內基地之問題。一般所最關切者尚為蘇聯對該約之反響。有人預料蘇聯將利用公布後與簽字間之空隙，發動驚人的政治反攻。東歐聯防公約之宣佈，可以即為其反措施之一。</p>

<p>〔聯合社珍珠港十七日電〕美國自日本奪得太平洋霸權僅及四年，又在該一洋面佈置主要防綫直達本國西岸，美國在東方海陸空軍雖均削減，但潛水艇則未減少，幫實力仍相當強大。太平洋司令部心目中之防綫為日本，沖繩與馬里安納週邊防綫，但此一防綫之供應與運輸，代價重大。軍事觀察家認為將來戰爭一旦發生，美國西海岸工業與飛機厰地帶將為敵方長程轟炸機或潛水艇定向炸彈攻擊目標，對付此種襲擊，唯有在可能的受攻擊地區及阿拉斯加一帶佈防。夏威夷島基地海空軍之西移，目的即在於此。太平洋艦隊司令藍姆塞宣佈海軍與海軍陸戰隊太平洋航空司令部正自夏威夷遷往桑地哥。故第三次大戰爆發時，夏威夷島已無被襲擊價值。觀察家預料遠東并無敵人能在太平洋面給予美國重大威脅。該區美國艦隊雖稀少，但大艦隊可在二十四小時內集合，以對付任何可能的海上威脅。美國之主要防備既佈置於西海岸，供給綫縮短，敵方潛艇即無得逞機會。蘇聯雖號稱擁有許多德國新式潛艇，但恐無充分駕駛經騐耳。</p>

<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>關於「局部和平」前後的一個城市的道報</p>
<p>拘留的地方是兩個茅屋，大小是一方丈半，下面墊的是麥管草，席地而臥。當我去的時候，原來還有八九位同志拘押在那兒，時間最久的拘押了八天，並且僅僅只問過一次。我去了以後，大家都談着他們被扣的經過，告訴我許多以往的情形，患難中便都成了朋友。繼我而來是九個學生，他們是湖北，四川，廣東等省的人，都帶有通行證，本來通過應無問題。但是因為他們過去是從青年軍復員後才求學的，於是便被扣留。他們到後，憤憤不平，說他們扣留的不應該，理由非常正大！晚上又來了十來個人，其中有東北第六兵團的副司令楊宏才等，他們是在東北受過訓，發給有通行證，準其回家者，然而也被扣留了。當天晚上，這兩間小屋內足足有三十多人，試想如何能容得下，於是大家只好席地而坐，沒法睡覺。到了半夜，那位衛兵同志還來教訓一番，弄得大家的情緒，非常惡劣！</p>
<p>拘留在這兒的人，是由他們供給囚糧，窩窩頭和生白菜。筆者從來沒有吃過窩窩頭，這回也嘗嘗這種滋味，到是一種人生的體認。可是第二天傳來的消息，說上級有通報來，以後不再供給囚糧了，連窩窩頭也沒有給我們吃了。因此他們便盡量疏通囚犯。學生們及楊宏才等，都先後釋回，只剩下九人了，當晚又釋了三天，只留六人了。</p>
<p>據聞公安局的局長來了，他親自加以處理，所以許多情節較輕的，昨天釋放了，今天又將其他的人加以處理，最後只留着我一人在此，蒙局長親加召見，談了一兩個小時。他說他們的檢查工作，只應採取兩種方式，一種是準其通過，一種不準通過，令其回去，不應如此扣押在這兒，這算是犯的什麼罪！？他答應馬上給我處理，可是又拖延了一天，一共扣押了五天，才準我回去，於是我又經過某地，乘車向濟南前進。</p>
<p>沿途所經過的都是老解放區，有許多村荘的土地是已經分過了的，有的卻還沒有分。分土地是以村為單位，這個村荘的人口少。土地多，每份地的數量便多些，如果人口多而土地少，則每份地的數量便少了。普通的情形是每份地三畝至五畝，無論老少男女，每人分一份地。出征軍人所分的地，如其家中無勞動力，便由全村代耕。每畝地須繳公糧三十斤，這是對國家的義務。現在因大軍南下，準備解放全中國，渤海軍區還實行向人民借糧，以維持政府開支。</p>
<p>中共的農村政策是來得比較嚴厲的！這許多老解放區多是經過鬥爭和清算過了的。我問某一位作農的老百姓，他家是不是被清算過？他輕輕地回答？他家裏過去有幾十畝地，因被清算現在只剩下十幾畝地了，其餘傢俱以及衣物也都被清算完了。他又告訴我到處都是幹部，要我不要亂說話。我又在路上休息的時候，有兩個小孩子向我討錢，我很奇怪，後來據店家的老板娘說：他們的家裏原來很好，因被鬥爭完了，所以現在才做乞丐。</p>
<p>中共的力量是深入了農村，民兵隊和鄉校都是他們的基層組織和幹部，很有控制的力量，譬如此次大軍南下，便抽調了許多農村幹部參加渡江戰役，這些幹部都是堅強而有力的份子，這是中共成功的一個主要力量。每個村荘的人民，經常召集各種會議，解決他們自己的問題，訓練得每個不識字的農人或老太婆，都能運用許多新的術語，說出了大篇的道理。無論那一個新解放地區，或新俘過來的士兵，都要舉行一次訴苦會，訴說他過去所受的一些什麼痛苦，而將這種痛苦產生的責任，完全推到國民黨身上，以提高他們的警覺與仇恨，一致來對付國民黨。</p>
<p>由這兒到濟南的公路，沿途路基非常的壞，常常因一點不小心，便會將汽車陷在那兒，無法前進。筆者於二十七日晚才到達濟南，沿途又經過若干次的檢查，奉均經通過，在濟南停了兩天，打聽前進的路線，便決定取道青島，由濟南乘火車至濰縣，濰縣再乘汽車至同村，由南村東去二十多里便是國軍的防哨線，沿途又經過若干次的檢查，都不如捷地和德州的嚴密。筆者此次沒有路條，而能安全的通過，於三月四日到達青島，在青島留兩天，六日乘輪來滬，八日到達上海，總算是萬幸的了！</p>
<p>（九）到了上海以後</p>
<p>筆者此番居住在北平的時間，共有一年半左右。去年十二月十三日北平開始被圍，我是在這個被圍的孤城中，居住了一個多月，親身體騐到戰爭的血腥氣味。宣佈局部和平辦法後，以及共軍進城，我又在北平停留了將近一個月的時間，親眼看到，親耳聽到，關於北平實現局部和平的許多事事實實；同時我在北平的接觸面也不算太窄，當然這種報導是會比那些僅到北平去跑了一趟，或者在監視保護下的走馬看花的看到一部分表面現象，要來得真實而切合事實的了。在事件的前因後果發展上，也許可以多知道一些。</p>
<p>我過去對華北的局勢相當樂觀。我認為傳作義的作風，思想，戰略，以及黨政軍各方面對他的配合上，比較全國的許多軍事領袖，各地的政治局勢，都要高明，進步，有辦法—！在全國各地都在打敗仗，而傳作義的隊伍在華北，卻打了了不少的勝仗。聶榮臻和他鬥着，始終是居下風。但是結果落到一個局部和平。局部和平便是投降。這在北平的事實發展上，證明是千真萬確的！這該是多麼的慘局！沒有將張家口斷然撤退，把基本部隊集中到平津，打一次真正的平津保衛戰，這是他戰略指揮上重大的錯誤，以致造成後來不可挽救的失敗局面。中共也承認傳作義還想打一下，可是因為察北的損失和犧牲，便不得不低頭了。</p>
<p>北平是投降了。但是全國各地的當局和人士，還有很多正在響往北平的局部和平。非常關心北平的情形，北平的局部和平便成了一種「北平型」，因此筆者特撰此文。全國和談的空氣正在濃厚的開展，據報傳孫閣倒後，繼任內閣可能是一個「和平內閣」的姿態出現。大家對和談的希望，顯然是很殷切的！這許多事實和情緒，正與過去北平和談時期的情況相似。筆者並不反對和平，而且是希望永久和平很殷切的人，然而事實的教訓，並不容許我對和談寄以較大的希望。傳作義所領導的局部和平，已經成為「北平型」了，而其中尚沒有規定要懲辦「戰犯」，譬如「戰犯」傳作義本身便是他們和談的對手方。但是毛澤東所發表的八項和平聲明，第一項便是懲辦戰犯，當然這比北平局部和平的條件是過之無不及！今天政府與中共的和談，是準備以毛澤東的八項和平聲明作基礎，假定這次和談能夠談判成功，還會比北平的和平，能有更好的成就嗎？假定南京政府馬上向中共表示投降，我想中共也提不出比毛澤東八項和平聲明更厲害的條件來了！許多士大夫階級和小資產階級幻想和平常以中共私人一二句比較富有感情的話，便引為精神上莫大的安慰，認定和談前途很有希望了！這種忽略問題本質，為表面現象所朦蔽的錯誤思想，是將鑄成莫在大的錯誤！中共對一切問題的看法，都是經過科學的研究與精密討論才決定，決不是憑私人一時的情感定取捨的，他們現在正是從事一種政治鬥爭，以革命的手段處理問題。中共的態度在新華日報的社論裏表示得很明白的，「將革命進行到底」才是他們的真正態度！今天南京政府希望在和談內有什麼成就，等於癩蛤蟆想吃天鵝肉，我想最大的成就也不過是拖延時間，使之準備完成，或更造成一些使他們解放全國的便利而已。我個人對和談是沒有很大的希望！小資產階級的脆弱意志和情感幻覺，在今日是以足誤人誤國的，暫時的茍安，並不是問題的解決。</p>
<h3 id="c87">血濺龜頭渚　軍官徐中立遇難　歌女沈麗芳等涉嫌被拘 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者石武威</p>
<p>〔本報無錫十七日訊〕太湖風景區龜頭渚，十六日晨發生一件驚人大血案，死者徐中立，係一軍官，與麗新布廠高級職員華志純·郁宗傑·及甜甜斯歌女沈麗芳，沈之表姊俞阿菊等五人，正在龜頭渚飛雲鬨遊覽時，詎竟樂極生悲，徐突遭狙擊，身中三槍，當塲畢命，出事後華等卽返城，報告城防部稽查隊，由郭隊長親率隊員前往緝兇，經搜索兩小時，並無所獲，同時華等四人，經該隊分別漏夜訊問，正着手追查線索。據郭隊長觀察，案情甚為複雜，不像盜刦殺人，也不像政治狙擊，總之，不是一般性任何人遇上便會發生之血案，而是另有原因，死者是特定目標。華沈等四人，經審訊後，因事關人命，案情重大，一併收押，聽候繼續偵查。</p>
<p>愛風流</p>
<p>雋侶遊春</p>
<p>徐中立，年三十五歲，四川安岳人，於三十五年春，跟隨毛森將軍來錫，初任無錫城防指揮部督察，旋改任情報參謀，迨該部結束，毛氏離錫後，徐乃退伍，担任在鄉軍官會就業輔導組組長，及本縣行政幹部訓練所軍訓大隊長。上月間，縣府招收攷鄉鎮自衛大隊附，徐應考得取，指派在馬路區忠孝鎮服務。惟徐平時素喜出入歌摥，故得識麗新布廠高級職員華志純·郁宗傑兩人，華為著名之「歌塲孝子」，如遇面目較好之歌女，無不狂捧濫捧，首對歌女田影追求，田離錫後，轉捧沈麗芳。前晚徐華又在甜甜斯歌塲碰面，兩人因久別重逢，更形熱絡，嗣由華提議，邀約沈麗芳等遊覽名勝，徐與沈本亦認識，嗣經約定昨晨八時，在中國飯店沈之寓處集合，由華之同事郁宗傑向廠中借得自備小汽車應用，八時半，一行五人，卽到達龜頭渚。</p>
<p>遭狙擊</p>
<p>哭煞嬌妻</p>
<p>徐等到達目的地後，卽循徑上山，一路登峯造極，盡情遊覽風景，迨至飛雲閣湖山酒家時，因均狠饑腸轆轆，乃各點餃麵一碗，望湖飽餐，非常快樂。當時徐曾唉聲嘆氣，對現社會表示不滿，說：「在這，我祗望吃吃玩玩就得了。」當又至附近蘭風亭攝影，詎正在興高之際，突來了身穿短裝手執短槍之五個不速客，叫他們不準動，嗣由為首兇徒，將徐身上之中央軍校證章，及公事皮包一只，金戒一只，手錶一只搶去，同時說：「你們倒開心，這樣時局還要來白相！」</p>
<p>繼卽對徐開槍放一槍，中在胸部，當時徐捧着胸還說：大家自己人，這又何必呢？兇徒復連開兩槍，徐乃倒地。兇徒見已肇禍，乃叫華等速走，不準報告。華等驚魂未定，匆匆下山，乘原車返城將實情報告城防部稽查隊，由郭隊長親率隊員，馳往出事地點搜索，但一無所獲，徐之屍身，由忠孝鎮蔣鎮長用汽車載回，擱在鎮公所樓下待殮。維時徐妻陳佩貞，（湖南籍）帶同五齡幼女元英，亦聞訊趕到，不禁大哭，情景異常悽慘。</p>
<p>嫌疑重</p>
<p>歌女收押</p>
<p>郭隊長回隊後，立將沈麗芳等四人，一併傳隊詢問。據沈供稱：年二十歲，上海人，原在上海華都舞廳當歌女，二年前來錫，在仙樂歌唱，其時即認識華志純，他經常來捧塲，一年半前，又在李參謀長元凱公館舉行派對時，與徐中立認識，曾和他跳過幾次舞，後來又回上海，最近在中國船廠做職員，因該廠要遷到臺灣，去故即請假。本月十二日經甜甜斯經理蔣憲基邀請，來錫客串，準備十五回滬，恰巧華來邀我前往遊覽等語。據華志純，郁宗傑，兩人供稱：這次徐中立的去，是他自動參加等語。</p>
<p>郭隊長</p>
<p>檢討案情</p>
<p>郭隊長供稱：認為本案內幕複雜不像盜刧殺人，因為如果目的在財物，那時園中尚無遊人，匪徒儘可從容搜劫，但匪雖在徐之身上因搜查槍械摸過一遍，卻未細搜，所以徐身上之小黃魚一條，和油棧單一紙，均未被劫，同時沈麗芳手上帶有很耀目之鑽戒，匪等亦未注意細搜，故可斷定匪徒目的，不在財物，順手搶刧，或為掩飾，若說政治性狙擊也不像，因為徐不是常到龜頭渚去的，匪徒不可能有計劃在該處猛擊。據郭隊長的結論，此案發生之原因，應從政治性狙擊，和盜劫殺人兩種可能以外去找尋，它可能是仇殺，或牽涉其他關係。總之，不像普通的盜刧案，現該隊已得重要線索，正派員四出追究，不日當可水落石出。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日現銷緊勢仍未稍戢，中央銀行為補救現鈔轉週之不足計，昨日開始對銀錢同業之提現者，搭發銀洋。昨日辦法，凡銀錢同業隔日有存款者，昨日申請者得按存款餘額發現鈔百分之五，銀洋百分之廿五，兩者合共為百分之三十。惟現鈔之提現較最高仍為百分之十。如照最高限額提取現鈔者，則銀洋照比例遞減為百分之廿。昨日銀洋每元作價為金圓七千元。據中央銀行某發言人稱：昨日發出之銀元已達三十萬枚。聞所發之銀洋，仍係庫存之舊銀洋，故包括各種式樣均有，並不限於船洋一種。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕黃金昨日前市微跌，後市略升。市上銀根鬆濫已極，暗息暴露，引起多頭興趣，更因股市不振，業外游資套製，買風仍熾。惟因連日漲勢銳勵，人心居高思危，園內更傳說央行有拋售之訊，故市況堅中帶軟，全程走勢疲檔甚多，高峯少見。晨初因銀根鬆勢極濫，更因隔夜俏勢未減，初具節開四八〇，四八五。開後浮多獲得頻了，新買懼有反響，頗具戒心，行情逐步盤小，低至四六九，四七二。小後散戶扒吸，市勢又見盤升，高至四八四，四八七。但高峯一現卽逝，枱面了售仍頻，又挫至四七二，四七五。嗣又升至四八六，四八九。瀕午聞央行有拋售之說，人心奇虛，惟終因游資鬆濫過甚，購買力強，午收略見軟化，而以四七八，四八一收盤。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華股昨日市勢仍疲，圈外黃金繼續挺升，業內游資再度外流，市上銀根昨日由平而泛，供源更旺證交塲外貼息低至四角三四角八分。惟因大局沉悶，工商危機四伏，人心頗多顧慮，更逢週五慣例，多方須負兩天利息，於是浮多紛了，新買不多，市勢陷入疲境，午收仍以低價結束。永紗晨初在銀根鬆動趨勢下，即以六元七角高盤喊出。喊後抬面起而拉抬，升至六元七七，隔夜浮多頻售，市勢即軟，低見六元五八。各方逢低再吸，又升至六元六八，證券幫力售，市勢直落，瀉至六元二九。嗣後大戶極力哄托，行情又見盤升，高至六元七角，惟仍不脫疲局。近午聞國行拋金傳說甚濃，人心動搖不已，趨勢再告慘瀉，低至六元二七。臨收得黃金走勢回挺，人心稍穩，終以六元四角二分收市。</p>
<p>中小型股，初開尚平，中途隨永紗之趨勢，走勢恍惚，疲擋盤旋，午收同告跌落。信和開後高起一角，午收仍回原盤。美亞開後市升一角八分，午收回低一角三分。景福勤興開後平疲，午收益軟。新光仍有幕後拉抬關係，午收仍站原盤。至餘各檔均無起色，成交五二億四千二百六十萬股。</p>

<p>外股市況昨日市勢仍榮，外匯證續見挺升，人心看好，執戶尤多板持，行情一致喊高。怡紗做一〇八〇〇元，一一〇〇〇元。業廣三八〇〇元，四〇〇〇元，升四百元。會德豐三八〇〇〇元，亦見俏俐</p>
<p>黃金公債晨開趨勢甚昂，喊二四五〇〇〇元有求。嗣因金價盤小，低至二四萬元，後又一路昂升至二五六〇〇〇元。午收二四五〇〇〇元。午後收盤二五萬元，成交不多。</p>

<p>米市漲風擴大，銀根旣鬆且濫，黃金價格較昨上漲甚多，是以人心殊堅，貨主報價甚力。南市塲開市祗漲二三千元，後聞北市漲多，故再上挺，薄稻曾出五萬大關，收市略回，為四萬九千元，漲四千五百元。早稻漲五萬五千。北市塲早開猛竄六七千，白粳一度出五萬大關，後市略回，收市四萬九千元，薄稻亦四萬九千元，各漲五千元。特粳高達五萬二千五百元，二市到貨八千二百十五石。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>漲風益厲，因銀根依然鬆弛，金價高昂，散戶乘機爭取，開價漲尚不多，後以買氣濃，乃再狂漲。豆油由十八萬六漲到十九萬七收市，軋升二萬二千。生菜油漲近二萬，生油奇貨可居，吉桶生油高達二十六萬，猛升四萬五千，達二成。豆餅挺二千元。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>漲風未戢，銀根鬆濫依然，北幫搜進仍力，且黃金米價激升，人心極昂，初開各貨普晉千元，中途福新廠拋出三四千包左右，市勢曾一度下跌，收市終以金價仍堅，而重告上揚。兵船臨收，高做一萬八千八百八十元，老車喊做一萬九千六百元，麩皮續挺千元，大包做一萬五千二百元。</p>

<p>四二支藍鳳由三百十四萬元一路低至三百十一萬元結局，較前升十四萬元。他若天女寶光等均在三百萬元關外做開。四〇支藍鳳亦竄出三百萬元，最後以三百〇七萬元收市，終挺十一萬元。三二支銀月晨開二百〇三萬元，嗣以本街複製業吸胃殊濃，價乃步步挺升，一度曾高見二百二十萬元，終為二百十四萬元，軋漲二十一萬元。</p>
<p>二十一支雙馬現貨僅好起八萬元，以一百六十三萬五千元結束，二十支雙馬一百五十七萬元，續挺十一萬元，其餘各級粗紗皆跟隨上揚。</p>

<p>人絲昨日市況續見市長，漲勢銳勵，晨初因銀根鬆濫，多單不易拆出，於是買風再起。</p>
<p>120號東洋晨開二二〇萬，一度升至二二二萬，高後散空吐售，圈外金價回小，市勢轉虛，僵面掀起軟風，喊價逐步低游，午收後低至二一六萬，最後以二一〇萬收市。午後銀根仍鬆，買氣仍旺，初喊二二〇萬，繼升至二二九萬。</p>

<p>綢緞昨日買氣不旺，實銷平淡，塲上供求轉多，納胃甚滯，行情高後轉回，收市殊為平庸。美亞晨開一一一萬元，開後一度軟弱，市勢低落，為一〇八五〇〇〇元，嗣本街納胃略起，喊價微升至一一〇萬午收。</p>

<p>又訊：本街店號感於茶價連綿飛晉，與所訂售價，漸有不敷成本之憾，爰於即日起，由同業公會重行　訂，藉資挹注，比前遞增一倍左右。聞龍井每斤最低三千二百元，最高四萬八千元。紅茶每斤最低一千六百元，最高三萬二千元。花茶最低每斤一千六百元，最高三萬二千元，貢菊每斤三千二百元至九千六百元，白菊每斤一千九百二十元至二千五百六十元。</p>

<p>大鈔出來罷　勿要忸怩了　搶銀元「黃牛」生意　社會竟如此無情！</p>
<p>銀元是小職員們保全幣値，以便逐日活命的媒介工具了。</p>
<p>這次的生活費指數，像我們前天的分析，指數本身的折扣，物價續漲的折扣，無異已經打了對折。除此之外，又碰着銀元暴漲，碰着現鈔恐慌；發薪都用本票，購銀元都要現鈔。於是本票換現鈔，要打八折，連日銀元上漲達四成，不啻再打個六折。</p>
<p>細細一算，這次拿十萬元薪資的中上職員，合實已抵不上二三萬元；真是硬傷之至。</p>
<p>昨天，央行拋出銀元卅多萬枚，是沒有大鈔頭寸呢？還是尚有搜刮現鈔的必要呢？</p>
<p>連天，央行配金，限收現鈔。拋給行荘用銀元，據說解救各行荘現鈔恐慌。</p>
<p>假使行荘用銀元發薪資，確不無解救現鈔荒之效。但得到解救的，限於行荘內部職員，廠商還是沒法子想。</p>
<p>其實，何必扳起腳來學小腳，要發大鈔，早有明文公佈。要商民團體來請求發大鈔這類把戲，多扮串旣沒有意義，而且也很少人會再有此種勇氣。</p>
<p>趨勢擺平了，儘可開天窗說亮話；發大鈔，物價必漲。不發大鈔，現鈔荒歸荒，物價漲歸漲，橫漲堅漲總是漲，何必扭扭揑揑又多添一個現鈔荒？而且，今日的作風，央行不無有控制現鈔撈貼水的嫌疑。旣有嫌疑，不論真假，央行當局總是冤哉枉哉？那更體恤！</p>
<p>大家都在談銀元黃牛，「黃牛」就有鄙視口吻，其實他們不過沒有大本鈿做生意，可是他的生意方法，實在和大公司的經理部長，毫無半點不同。</p>
<p>我並不打算在這裏替他們辯護，現在想講講他們的萬里前程。</p>
<p>局勢如此這般，小職員們過去還囤糧買肥皂，現在眼光不能不越看越短，雖不願意手裏留紙幣，卻也不能不手裏留隨身可帶的錢。</p>
<p>黃金美鈔，是錢中之王，但非小職員們所敢染指，於是自然而然和銀元結了不解緣。</p>
<p>現在，一般職員階級，多數是領了薪水買銀元，一個個敲　銀元買小菜。一口氣買來，一個個出去；每個銀元小販，今後都像過去的錢兌店。</p>
<p>正因為銀元交易，有其萬里前程，因而金銀市塲的成立，就有分治其利的作用。想想看，連這一些利益，都不讓這批失業市民去做，社會的無情與冷酷，程度之大，也可想而知了！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據可靠消息：中央銀行因近月僑匯收入，仍未達預期目標，最近一週來，已改變僑匯褂牌辦法。在僑匯口岸廣州，汕頭，夏門，福州，梧州及青島等六地，由中央銀行察酌當地實際情形，分別掛牌，同時由六地中交兩行協助收匯。此舉目的，在使僑匯率與各地市塲匯之國家銀行，俾僑匯能經由各經匯之國家銀行，源源流返祖國。而增加外匯資源。該項辦法，現已試辦一週，成績頗佳。一俟獲具相當效果，全部實施辦法，卽將正式公告。聞上週以僑匯牌價未能切合現實，臻僑匯之收入大減，全月僅數十萬美元云。</p>

<p>甲組足球聯賽，今日祗有一塲，於下千三時在逸園球塲舉行，精武會再度逢志超會。</p>
<p>第一週特環賽，精武先勝兩球，志超趕上三只，反敗為勝，更挾破龍頭之餘威，由鐵衛吳祺祥率領，在技術上有顯著之進步，全隊是守勝於攻，吳祺祥座鎮第三內衛有若長江天塹，精武小將若想從中路突破吳之重關，則猶使蚊負山與商蚷游河也。前衛線得老吳扶持，亦漸趨穩健，前鋒之小將，推動夠迅速，惟犯好盤，右翼尚世祺有腳下功夫，夠速度，腳頭清脆，志超之攻勢，若能得到世祺源源之傳中，則精武禁區內難免受嚴重之威脅。</p>
<p>精武小將狀態不時，最佳時曾迫和青白，失態時零亂無章，馬帬賢若能及時由港趕回，則前鋒可增厚實力，然亦犯好盤，費時誤事，若從中路進攻，則不啻以堅攻堅，絕非上策，宜多運用兩翼以牽制志超之內衛，在禁區內有活動之機會。守衛實力，頗見平均，攻勢較弱，未足以破志超以後防，故精武諸小將須有大無畏之精神，力拼到底，始有雪上次一箭之仇也。</p>

<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦十八日電〕本年英國跑馬季已於十七日開始，循例每年最先舉行者為林肯賽，其節目中包括著名之林肯郡讓步賽在內，是項讓步賽將於星期六舉行，且適為其百週紀念日。但林肯郡賽馬歷史猶不止百年，據市政廳記錄，一五九七年卽載有核準某項費用係有關賽馬者。另一條載英王傑姆士一世在林肯參觀大賽馬，但直至一六八〇年始每年經常舉行，英國賽馬歷史則尚遠在此等古檔案所記時日之前。當羅馬當局以羅馬帝國一省地位治理英倫之時，賽馬已為一種普遍運動，據史籍記載，一千七百餘年前，在某一今日依舊舉行障礙賽之地點卽有有組織之比賽，英國賽馬事宜係由名為「騎師俱樂部」之團體管理，此俱樂部成立已二百年，每年六月在艾浦遜所舉行之大賽馬或為世間最著名之馬賽，此係舉國影從之大事，卽平日不問賽馬者，亦往往於此賽中下注，在蒞塲觀賽者，則可見英國運動生活中獨一無二有聲有色洋洋大觀之景象。</p>

<p>籃球聯賽今日下午五時半起男子甲一甲二及女子組共三塲，賡續在市體育館交鋒，門票照舊，樓上五百，樓下一千，塲內對號一千五百無了。秩序及裁判名單如下：</p>
<p>力隊——約翰（女子組）五時卅分　裁判劉荷生　吳子彬</p>
<p>汕隊——崇德（甲二D）六時一刻　裁判周懷邦　宣智傑</p>
<p>滬警——培斐爾（甲一組）七時一刻　裁判金伯陶　胡宗藩</p>
<p>女組開塲力隊再戰約翰，按兩隊初循相値，約翰以四一比廿八克力隊，惟約翰先後六戰，亦僅勝此一仗，今晚對力隊後，祗剩對星華一塲，故勝負將有關黃包裹，蓋萬一失敗，則與力隊積分相等矣。惟約翰麾下擁有李森林靜怡張羅羅等好手，勝利可期，力隊實力較弱，范玉英梁妙珍外，經騐均嫌不足，惟該隊精神至佳，屢戰屢北，而勇氣不愛，屆時抵抗到底，必有劇爭。</p>
<p>繼之為甲二D組汕隊與崇德對壘，前者兩度出馬，勝負參半，該隊在滬上原具相當歷史，惟經改組後，人材星散，陳清江周斌鄭國藩雖係舊侶，但合作方面已不如前，今戰崇德，崇德在該組中兩戰兩北，鬥力似見最弱，然兩度被挫，當圖振奮，出其全力以與汕隊周旋，則勝負之數難卜</p>
<p>壓軸大戲甲一組滬警與番軍培斐爾再度相逢，按第一循環培斐爾為滬警擊敗，輸去九分，但進入第二循環以來，克華聯，勝海青，破麥令麥斯三復前仇，屢北之師一變而為常勝，隊長克勒黑炭勃朗愈打愈好，伊卡特格萊奇緣葉相扶，合作功夫亦有長足進境，滬警為其冤家對頭，此番再度相逢値，必謀報復，滬警在二循中頗為不利，受挫於麥令斯，大敗於恩卡斯，而在第一循環中固皆手下敗將也。今晚又是一支敗潰番兵，懲前毖後，金貴伯文其俠等，當早謀破敵之計，以挽令譽，屆時中西兩路雄師，一塲龍爭虎鬥必有精緊之演出。六路人馬名單如下：</p>
<p>（力隊）翁霞云，王嘉華，梁妙靈，姚文達，梁妙珍，范玉英，陳善寶，劉澹哉，張善福，周猶男。</p>

<h3 id="c119">女子籃球術 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 公譯述</p>
<p>圖二與圖三就是兩個基本的移動區域制方式，當皮球傳遞到那一個地區時，守衛者之陣形就隨着皮球之所在而移動。</p>
<p>這兩個陣形很明顯的將守衛三人分為三道防線來防守，（圖二）當皮球由進攻者之中鋒傳到籃之右段區域時，守方之右守衛則在罰球圈線之外做成第一道防禦線；正中衛在罰球界線上佈下第二道防線，左守衛在半圓周之角佈下第三道防線，她是最後一道防線之守衛者，就是看管着籃下之一個區域，阻撓着進攻者在籃下投籃或將球托入籃圈之企圖。</p>
<p>圖三是一個相反的陣形，皮球是人中圈發球時傳到左方去，這個區域是由左守衛來佈下第一道防線，正中衛仍居第二道防線，右守衛是最後一道防線。看圖一之球塲上的假想點線，就明瞭皮球之所在，而守衛者就隨着皮球之所在而移動有如圖二與圖三之陣形。</p>
<p>第三個基本的移動方式是有如圖四之陣形；進攻者持球在當中之區域，守衛者之陣形僅須作簡單之移動，仍然是未脫分為三道防線之方式，守方正右衛站在半圓周之頂端成為第一道防線，左守衛在罰球線後佈成第二道防線，右守衛則在籃下守第三道防線。在這種情況下，守衛者祗須要看管着持球之敵鋒，對於其他沒有持球在手的進攻者不必去跟隨，最要緊的是緊守着自己看管的區域，當皮球到達另一個區域時，該區域之守衛者務須迅速地抵達皮球所在的地方，但不宜於移動得過早，否則會露出空檔給予進攻者乘機切入之機會；守衛者宜沉着應付，不要受欺騙之假動作而被誘離開，所看管之區域，若果看準進攻者之動作，有時還可以攔截到進攻者之傳遞。</p>
<p>按照這個陣形來取守勢，祗要皮球離開了那位進攻者之手上，則看管她的守衛須立卽退回，根據皮球之所在而採移動區域的防禦制。</p>
<p>進攻者有時會施用三個前夕集在一個區域地段而採取攻勢，移動區域防禦制須作有效之防禦，這種進攻戰術，則以第二道防線為骨幹，她要有精明的判斷力，夠機智和敏捷，進退合時，她有以上各項技能和有穩健之演出，有如擎天之柱，守方仍可安如磐石。</p>
<p>不過；須要記牢幾個重要之原則，守衛者之戰略重要地段是以半圓徑十五尺為區域，以罰球線為中央點。防禦的工作是採用牽延之手段而不是斷然之處置，並不是立卽就將皮球搶得而是高法延遲進攻者獲分之時間。切要記牢是移動的區域制，假使皮球在東區，在東區的守衛就向持球者衝上去，而另一守衛就填補着其本人應負責看守的防線，這是三位一體的事，要有默契之聯絡，才能成為整個的守陣形。</p>
<p>圖示進攻者之前鋒持球在手，右守衛看見籃球之所在地而向前衝去來看管她，假使該進攻者將球傳遞與她相距祗數尺之另一進攻者，該右守衛須立卽將其位置移動向持球者方面去看管她。正中衛與左守衛亦將位置面向右方移動來警戒着，有如扇形之擺動。</p>
<p>倘若該進攻者將球傳遞給與另一位站在較遠深入區域之另一進攻者，在此時此地段之填補責任是落在看管第二道防線之正中衛之　中了，她在可能範圍內向右方趨前看管持球者。（未完。四）</p>

<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>事情發生於月中發薪的前後。</p>
<p>十四日下午，為了如何處理明天所得薪金事，幾個同人曾板起面孔，像煞有介事地會議了大半天，滿想好好地發揮一下這筆薪水的効用。固然，彼此都深知區區之數，無須寄以厚望，但　總想在微末的數目上，創造一些「奇蹟」，好讓半月中的開支不無小補。大家的意見，除了對金鈔·物資·拆息各有不同見解外，而於「袁大頭」一點，則無不眾口一詞，深惡痛絕，都說再不要上「冤大頭」的當了。「你看：大頭從舊年年初就已一千六百，此後的一個多月中，竟止有跌無漲。上次一點「應變費」，全買了「大頭」。一六買進，一四賣出，真是慘絕人寰，冤透，怨透！」——大家綜合的意見如此。</p>
<p>會議繼續了下去。為慎重計，曾再把「大頭」日內有無上漲之可能，檢討研究了約半小時。眾人皆想不出其有突飛猛漲的道理</p>
<p>十四號夜半，我失眠了兩小時。原因是：要是買「大頭」，最適合我們這一流的身份；買別的，還得找路道，還得要款子的數目多；但仔細思量的結論，總覺得前車可鑒，不能再捧袁世凱的腦壳的塲，而自食其果了。</p>
<p>十五號清晨，揩了面，早飯也不吃，就奔向辦公廳去領薪水。大家不再考慮「大頭」，一致以為央行要大拋黃金，銀根必緊，還是放「星期存款」去吧，這是比較容易辦而不會「太吃虧」的。至少，可以保持一部份幣值。也有人，家里的油米柴鹽寗可不買，先放拆息去。</p>
<p>結果呢？十五號中午過後，「大頭」從四四跳到四八，十六號晚上，則已到了六五高峯，比金·鈔漲得快，跳得兇，比「星期存款」的拆息，更是大巫小巫了。由是，又一次冤透，怨透！</p>
<p>「你看：咱們買什麼，不漲什麼；不買什麼，漲什麼！可見書生謀利，猶如秀才造反，到頭來一事無成！」</p>
<p>其實，這道理說穿了一文不値：各廠商，各商店以及上海各公務機關，皆在十五日發薪，公務員工們拿了此區區之數，沒有別的念頭好轉，自然還是買「大頭」。則「大頭」安得不狂漲？怎麼失眠了一夜，會議了半天，連這些道理都想不出呢？</p>
<p>想到這裏，便只敲敲自己的不大不小的「頭」，無可奈何地擔起筆桿，寫篇稿子投給「自由談」，一則一洩胸中怨氣，二則賺點稿費，以資彌補。</p>
<p>袁大頭，冤大頭，怨大頭！</p>

<p>法院刑庭的制服，在我國用青，白，紅三種顏色來鑲邊，這是照我國國旗「青天白日滿地紅」的彩色而定，意義深長。</p>
<p>推事制服的鑲邊是青色，以示公正無私，表達俗語所謂「青天」的剛毅精神。</p>
<p>律師的天職是保障人權，以申正義，像白日一般普照人類，所以用白色鑲邊。</p>
<p>檢察官的任務在剷除貪官汚吏，掃盡社會敗類，所以鑲邊紅色，用來表示他的那種勇往直前，凜然不可侵犯的氣概。</p>

<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>孔子言：「夷狄之有君，不如諸夏之亡也。」諸夏無君，時人乃以對黃梁同夢。諸為諸貞壯，夏為夏敬觀，諸已逝世多年，夏仍健在，世人但知兩人以詩名，不知兩人皆為實行之革命家也。夏佐蘇撫程德全幕，辛亥年德全以獨立響應武昌黎元洪，夏與有力焉。清季湖北巡警道馮啓鈞（字少竹，廣東人），雖貪汚好色，聲名狼藉，而人極機警幹練，黨人頗有遭其毒手者。及瑞澂至，首奏參之，其幕府中贊助之者，諸貞壯也。繼馮啓鈞為巡警道者，乃一忠厚長者黃祖徽，幾十起義所以能一日夜成功，與此不無關係。如馮啓鈞在當時仍任巡警道，局勢或將改觀，亦未可知。瑞澂逃而諸貞壯並未顯達，陰助黨人，事成不言其功，尤為難得。</p>
<p>黃梁同夢，指黃濬與梁鴻志，世皆知之。讀一學期，轉入大學堂，黃則在譯學館畢業，在余前一班，乃乙級學生也。梁之爰居閣詩集，與黃之詩集花隨人聖　（所謂花者，指北方名妓梁翠芬，共納為妾。）筆記，皆有名於時，乃兩人先後竟如黃梁同夢之讖語，不得善終，可異可悲，豈可與諸夏無君之得為革命史料者並稱乎？</p>

<p>— 丁乙</p>
<p>人類正在因發現原子能而誇耀的時候，宇宙間的動物，卻早已有驚人技藝。某種較知更鳥尚小的鳥類，每年要作二千哩不休止的飛行二次；有種昆蟲，能跳越比自己體長多一百倍的距離，和跳躍到比身體高五百倍的高度。甲蟲也是奇蹟之一例，它能舉起相當於自己身重五百倍的東西。</p>
<p>這種能究竟來自何處，至今尚屬一謎。若我們人類也能學到甲蟲的本領，則可以輕易舉起三十六噸的重物，或者可以縱身跳過摩天大廈了。</p>
<p>阿拉斯加的金色　，每春要來回一次於夏威夷帬島，在二千哩茫無陸地的海洋上不停飛行，因為鳥類的嘴不適於在空中捕捉昆蟲，所以可以確定它們在長程飛行中是不吃任何東西的。然則，又何處來足夠的能量以作消耗呢？</p>
<p>很久以前，法國的名昆蟲學家佛貝，曾費去數年功夫，耐心觀察他花園裏的小動物。他注意到一隻幼蠍，雖然初生一週尚未吃過食物，但是仍能運動消耗能力。初生的蜘蛛也是同樣情形，這種現象正是佛貝所大惑不解的。</p>
<p>他又作一試騐，將蠍子裝在一玻璃瓶內，內祗儲有無微菌的細沙及空氣。九個月後，它們仍活着，且反使蟲體增大了。佛貝當時曾為此奇蹟而迷惑，我們至今也仍未打破這個謎。</p>

<p>— 葉菲</p>
<p>永華公司的影片，從「國魂」「清宮秘史」到現在的「春雷」，一貫地告訴觀眾：「我肯化錢！」這在粗製濫造以及停留在「火燒紅運寺」時代的國片充斥市塲時，無疑地是個好現象。</p>
<p>「春雷」的故事很人情味，有說教的主題，但不算討厭。內容述一個年青有錢的實業家潘叔明，先邂逅交際花沈曼麗，後與未婚妻李含芳結婚。而沈腹中一塊肉，卻賴李之護持出生，以說明做母親的對於第二代的責任。春雷之設，一在遲誤航程，二在曼麗荐枕，三在赴澳滅頂，皆直接發生在潘叔明身上，卻影響了李含芳原來應該很平坦的人生路。</p>
<p>李含芳是片中最主要的主角，從嬌麗的少女，溫柔的妻子，到賢良的母親，過程非常自然。賢淑的女性，在現社會中並不少見，但有見地，肯負責的女子，像保全乃夫的遺腹子（乃夫情婦所孕）這件事，着眼在無辜的第二代的教養問題（固然一小半是因為愛丈夫），而不是如世俗所想像的「預備做現成老太太」（沈曼麗語），卻真難得。最後沈見潘脫險歸來，以索回孩子來要挾潘重拾舊歡，李的見解是：沈得自問配不配做孩子的母親。「一個男子往往因為一時的尋樂留下了孩子，不負責任地走開了，甚至以為金錢就可以贖了這種罪過，而不知母親生了孩子，不僅應該給他穿衣吃飯，更要緊的是給他教育，」（大意如此）。這不但警告了天下的荒唐男子，也給母親們不少啓示。演員李麗華很認真，三個時代刻劃分明，演來勝任愉快，比她以往演「假鳳虛凰」時之一味賣「嗲」，已不可同日而語。</p>
<p>孫景路的沈曼麗，很夠妖媚，雖然受了舞臺上的影響，有些動作（如與看屋老頭爭吵）未免誇張，但大體上祗有比李麗華更能演戲。裝嚇暈時的特寫，眼睫轉移，唇角微啓，非常逗人遐想。後半部不見出色，應由編劇負責。沈曼麗的性格前後並不統一，開始時沈對潘一見鐘情，絕對是為了愛潘，不是為了愛潘的錢，自與一般蕩婦妖姬有別；然則沈得知潘的死訊卻不悲哀而一意墮胎，潘妻請求保留胎兒還得有「以遺產一半易兒」的君子協定，怎變得這樣不近人情？旣已變得不近人情，最後的輕易放手，又似乎太不可能了。</p>
<p>編劇對於潘叔明，有所偏袒。寫他對沈曼麗矜持於前，失悔於後，編劇與潘自己，都歸罪在酒的，但照畫面上敘述，沈移樽就教進潘房時，潘當時未嘗喝過酒；其後潘受不住沈玉體橫陳的誘惑，才背轉身倒酒狂飲。說潘故意飲酒增加色胆則可，說潘酒後失檢，則太原諒他了。（而且這瓶酒也安排得太突兀，深夜旅舍房間中，潘非酒徒，何來此一大瓶烈性酒？難道預先知道沈曼麗會到他房中暈倒的嗎？）嚴化演出，深度不夠，而且，不可愛。</p>
<p>配角姜明于玲等造型不壞；姜明的國語可惜太糟。</p>
<p>攝影很美，外景當然是佔了港九山水不少的光。但潘鄉居蜜月時夢見沈曼麗一塲，沒有在攝影上說明夢景，頗令觀眾一驚。時裝展覽會中的數人面部特寫，除了捧捧那幾個臨時演員，實在多餘。</p>
<p>佈景服裝，極盡鋪張富麗之能事。但服裝未免太多，兩個女主角穿不完，還安排了一個時裝展覽會，有點顯得故意擺闊了。</p>
<p>最後應該提出的，是該片錄音的清晰，在國片中實不多見。兩女主角前後都唱過的插曲，也異常動聽，雖然舞塲中的「名媛」竟肯播唱四年前卽在良家婦女口中吟唱的流行歌曲，是個大笑話，但那是編劇的事，與歌曲本身無關。</p>

<h3 id="e1">North Atlantic Treaty Announced: Declaration to Resist Any Aggression Against Europe or North America with Collective Armed Action <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The State Department announced that the full text of the North Atlantic Treaty, consisting of 1,040 characters, will be published at 4:00 PM Standard Time on Friday (midnight on the same day Shanghai time). A total of twelve countries have been invited to come here to sign the treaty in early April.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The content of the North Atlantic Treaty was announced today in the capitals of the United States, Britain, France, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Norway. The eight participating countries (Iceland, Denmark, Portugal, and Italy are also expected to be invited) declared their determination to resist aggression in any location in Europe and North America with collective armed action, using armed forces if necessary to counter such aggression. The eight countries also agreed to consult with each other in the event of a threat to the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of any signatory country to devise countermeasures. The provisions for taking collective action to repel aggression are found in Article 5 of the treaty, which states that any attack and any measures taken as a result to restore or maintain the security of the North Atlantic area shall be reported to the United Nations Security Council. The signatory countries shall also organize a committee to implement the treaty, organized in such a way as to be able to convene quickly at any time. The treaty specifically states that its signing does not affect the responsibility of the United Nations Security Council for maintaining international security and peace. Article 8 of the treaty guarantees that existing international treaties, such as the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet treaties, will not be affected by the signing of the treaty. Article 1 of the treaty clearly states that the signatory countries may, with unanimous agreement, invite any other European country that can promote the principles of the treaty and contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to join the treaty. The treaty shall enter into force upon the deposit of instruments of ratification with the Government of the United States by a majority of the signatory countries. Ten years after the treaty enters into force, it may be extended for another ten years by agreement of all signatory countries at the request of any signatory country. After twenty years of implementation, any signatory country may give one year's notice of withdrawal from the treaty. (The full text of the treaty is published on page 3.)</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] The historic North Atlantic Treaty will unite Western anti-communist countries, rearm them, and defend against attacks from the Soviet Union or other sources. After the publication of the treaty, it will provoke renewed condemnation from Soviet and communist leaders around the world and heated discussions in Western countries. Once the treaty is signed, it will only need to be ratified by the parliaments of a majority of the signatory countries to be implemented. However, that majority of signatory countries must include the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. According to President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson, the North Atlantic Treaty is only one of the United States' four major diplomatic initiatives. The second step will be to submit a bill to the Senate requesting one billion dollars in military aid to Western Europe at the same time as the treaty is approved.</p>
<h3 id="e2">On the Day of the Announcement of the North Atlantic Treaty, the Chinese Communist Party, in Coordination with Moscow, Broadcast Calls for Opposition to a New World War <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) radio broadcast a Xinhua News Agency editorial titled "Mobilize the Peaceful Forces of the World," strongly calling on the people of all China to actively participate in the actions of people in all countries to oppose the danger of a new war and calling on all people's organizations to elect representatives to attend the World Congress for the Defense of Peace in April to "smash the conspiracy of war provocateurs." The article criticized the United States for refusing to negotiate with the Soviet Union and rejecting proposals for disarmament and a ban on the use of atomic weapons. It also said that "American imperialism is our mortal enemy, and the Soviet Union is our comrade-in-arms. The Soviet Union was the first to abolish the unequal treaties of Tsarist Russia and provided practical assistance to China in its war against Japan. The Red Army crushed the elite Japanese Kwantung Army, prompting Japan to surrender." The decision on Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian (Dairen) in the Sino-Soviet Treaty is "a major blow to imperialism and a peaceful guarantee for the Chinese people." The CCP's broadcast on the day that the content of the European North Atlantic Treaty was announced has attracted much attention from various parties. It is generally believed that the CCP's issuance of an international call for peace at this time is clearly in coordination with the actions of the Third International headquarters in Moscow. According to international situation observers here, the North Atlantic Treaty will be formally signed in Washington on April 4. It is predicted that the democratic bloc of countries and the totalitarian communist forces will enter a new stage. In order to counterattack, the Soviet Union will inevitably call on its satellite countries to launch new offensives. In yesterday's Xinhua News Agency editorial, the CCP clearly accused "American imperialism of actively preparing for a new world war. All peace-loving people around the world must mobilize to oppose the danger of a new war. As long as all peace-loving forces around the world unite and struggle, the danger of war can be completely overcome." In the northeast and north China areas controlled by the CCP, actions against the United States, opposition to American aid to the Nationalist government, and accusations of MacArthur supporting Japan against the Soviet Union have become increasingly aggressive. According to reliable sources, the CCP has conducted a thorough review of the Pacific situation and plans to coordinate its military actions to cross the Yangtze River with the situation in Europe. It is said that CCP leaders close to Moscow are strongly advocating crossing the river, targeting Wuhan and Guangzhou as attack objectives, hoping to merge with communist forces in Southeast Asia, creating a red zone in the Western Pacific to confront the United States. Another faction of key communist figures believes that in order to complete the "Chinese Revolution," the heart of the Nationalist government in Nanjing and Shanghai should be the primary target of attack, with the aim of defeating the National Army and unifying China, thereby changing the Asian situation. It is generally believed that regardless of which decision the CCP takes, it is believed that the reorganization and retraining of the communist forces north of the Yangtze River will be completed by the end of this month at the latest, and that its offensive to cross the river will be launched in early April, echoing the tense situation in the Western Pacific. This kind of action has gradually attracted the attention of international figures. Yesterday, the CCP radio clearly and publicly introduced Stalin's two statements on January 30 and February 2 expressing his willingness to meet with US President Truman, and emphasized the statements of French Communist Party leader Maurice Thorez, Italian Communist Party leader Palmiro Togliatti, and communist parties in various countries against the danger of a new war, calling on the Chinese people to "undoubtedly strive to support the calls of the world's peaceful forces, and the Chinese people must actively participate in the ranks against a new war." It is said that the CCP will send representatives to participate in the World Congress for the Defense of Peace to be convened in April, "with the Chinese people's own beliefs," to cooperate with people around the world, believing that "American imperialism will definitely be defeated, and the danger of a new war will definitely be overcome."</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The delegation of staff from various agencies in the capital who were forced to suspend pay and work petitioned the Legislative Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the new President of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin, on the 18th, demanding immediate reinstatement and compensation for the balance of the three months' salary that had already been prepaid at the current rate. President He sent staff officer Liu Shijin to meet with them, expressing extreme concern about the matter and stating that he would find a way to solve it as soon as he took office. The Legislative Yuan sent members Shao Jingren and Zou Shuwen to meet with them, promising to forward their demands to the general assembly. The Supervisory Yuan sent members Gu Fengxiang and Xiong Zaiwei to meet with them, promising to convey their demands to President He and find a solution when they meet with him in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Supervisory Yuan Tea Party Hosts President He: Presents Seven Political Opinions, Hoping to Strengthen Reform, Progress, Unity, Establish Trustworthiness, Select Talent, Rectify Discipline, Punish Corruption Severely, and Promote Peace <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The opinions of all members of the Supervisory Yuan on the current political situation were presented to President He at the tea party hosted by Presidents Yu Youren and Liu Zhe of the two Yuan on the afternoon of the 18th. The focus was divided into seven points: (1) Strengthen the determination for reform, (2) Strengthen progress and unity, (3) Make careful decisions and establish government credibility, (4) Select talent, (5) Rectify discipline, (6) Enforce the rule of law and punish corruption severely, and (7) Promote peace. The tea party was held at the International Recreation Club at 4:00 PM. More than 90 Supervisory Yuan members participated. He arrived punctually at 4:00 PM, first shaking hands with each Supervisory Yuan member, then taking a seat. Presidents Yu and Liu successively stood up to speak, saying that President He was forming a cabinet, and the Supervisory Yuan was meeting at this time, bringing local situations to the central government, and the Supervisory Yuan members could also state the hopes of the various places for President He. Subsequently, Gu Fengxiang, Liu Pingjiang, Chen Yunge, and others made oral explanations on the seven opinions they put forward. Gu especially emphasized that the country is in extreme danger today. If President He does not resolutely reform at this time of crisis, today's crisis cannot be saved. Only through reform can it be revived. Unity and progress are even more necessary today, but the unity should be a progressive force, revolutionary people, rather than perfunctory dealing with factions. Gu also pointed out that in the past, due to unstable policies and constantly changing orders, public grievances were boiling. Liu Pingjiang proposed "Determine national policy, know people and be good at assigning them, clearly define powers and responsibilities, and reward and punish fairly" as the responsibility of the cabinet premier, hoping to implement new policies and use new people. Those with proven corruption in the past and those without political achievements should be rejected outside the cabinet door, and he especially pointed out that the choice of finance minister should be careful and that financial tycoons should not be used again, otherwise, it will definitely fail, and the past abandonment of discipline, the decay of military discipline and political ethics, must be rectified. Chen Yunge said that promoting peace has become a unanimous call throughout the country. Regardless of the reasons and needs for the war, in this situation where people across the country are separated from their wives and children, the people can no longer tolerate the war. Only by seeking peace can the needs of the people be met. Subsequently, Gesang Yueshi, Sun Yucong, Cao Dexuan, Qi Dapeng, and others spoke. Sun especially encouraged President He to have the determination and courage to reform, and the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan will resolutely support the progressive He cabinet. Cao Dexuan spoke passionately, saying that to rectify discipline, it is necessary to start by punishing Liu Zhi, the commander who lost the Battle of Xuzhou, and Wei Lihuang, who abandoned Shenyang without a fight. Sun Ke, the former President of the Executive Yuan, should also be punished. Cao also proposed that peace should have limits, support preparing for war while seeking peace, oppose ceasing war and begging for peace, firmly oppose the localized surrender-style peace, and advocate that war and peace should be decided by the National Assembly. The tea party ended at half-past five.</p>

<p>Says he is determined to strive for peace</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] President He Yingqin personally declared at the reception hosted by President Yu Youren and Vice President Liu Zhe of the Supervisory Yuan on the afternoon of the 18th that the new cabinet he organized is a peace cabinet. He is determined to strive for peace, improve people's lives, and seek national construction to increase the happiness of the people. Cabinet members are also being sought from all parties in accordance with this direction, and he is determined to follow the principle of selecting the virtuous and capable to recruit true talents. However, because the current situation is difficult, many virtuous and capable people are unwilling to enter the cabinet rashly, so it is still necessary to urge them in many ways, and the list of cabinet members cannot be announced early. He pointed out that the current situation is difficult and that we must work together to save the crisis and called on the Supervisory Yuan and Legislative Yuan members to provide more assistance and support to overcome the difficulties together and complete the mission. He said that accepting the mandate to form a cabinet was like jumping into a fire pit. Knowing it was a fire pit, why was he willing to jump? It was because he saw that the people were living in dire straits and suffering unspeakable hardships, and it was necessary to seek peace to save them. After Japan surrendered, he believed that war was cruel and immediately asked the government to send him to work at the Security Council to promote world peace. At that time, he lectured everywhere in the United States, advocating peace and believing that the world had already experienced two world wars, and there should be no more wars in the future. When he heard that the Political Consultative Conference was being held domestically to resolve domestic problems, he felt very excited. He also recounted his experience in forming the cabinet at the meeting, modestly saying that since he participated in the Xinhai Revolution in the first year of the Republic, he has always been engaged in military work and has little research on political work, and lacks experience and cadres. He repeatedly and firmly declined, but after Vice President Li sent Mr. Wu Liqing and others to persuade him many times, he reluctantly agreed to do his best, and everything was unprepared. Recently, he has been busy forming a cabinet, and he has not had time to draft policy guidelines. He will provide the suggestions of the Supervisory Yuan members to his future cabinet colleagues for common reference. He's attitude was sincere, and he won unanimous praise from the Supervisory Yuan members. After He spoke, President Yu Youren stood up and made a concluding speech, saying: "If he doesn't jump into the fire pit, who can jump into the fire pit? I believe Mr. He will surely guide me to take the bright path." The reception ended in warm applause.</p>
<h3 id="e9">New Cabinet Personnel Difficult to Assemble: Ideal Candidates Still Modestly Declining in Various Ways, Full List May be Decided Tonight <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The work of organizing the new cabinet has obviously encountered great difficulties. Although He Yingqin has been working hard with great courage and perseverance, he has achieved little success. He Yingqin told reporters on the 18th that he had been inviting people from all over the country to join the cabinet, and had been making long-distance calls to Guangzhou and Shanghai for days, and his voice was almost hoarse. He also repeatedly said that there were many difficulties. He's ideal and goal is for cabinet members to be detached in position, rich in qualifications, and avoid using old people as much as possible. However, as of the 18th, almost nine out of ten of the people he invited had politely declined, so He had to change his consideration to new people. At the same time, the level of the people he was considering had to be gradually lowered. Political figures in Nanjing admire He's efforts in this kind of expectation, but they are all pessimists about his achievements. Currently, entering the cabinet has been seen by the general public as "jumping into a fire pit." If new people do not have the courage and determination to jump into the fire pit, they will inevitably turn to recruiting old bureaucrats, and the original ideals of the He cabinet will be greatly discounted. He's attitude towards people and things is extremely sincere, which can avoid the possible criticism he may encounter due to the slow formation of the cabinet. He still meets with Vice President Li every day to report and discuss personnel issues. He went to visit him at 3:00 PM on the 18th and talked for an hour before leaving.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] According to extremely reliable sources, the list of the new cabinet had not been finalized as of the evening of the 18th. Although the personnel reported in the newspapers these days have their basis, most of them are still in the process of being contacted. The source revealed that if there are no unexpected changes, the full list is expected to be finalized on the evening of the 19th. However, the announcement may be on the 21st, because the Vice President who is a member of the Kuomintang must be approved by the Central Standing Committee, and the heads of ministries and commissions must be approved by the Central Political Committee.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It has not yet been decided whether the Democratic Socialist Party will participate in the new cabinet. The party held a Central Standing Committee meeting in Shanghai yesterday. Zhang Junmai was absent due to illness. Because of the disagreement within the meeting, no conclusion was reached, and it was decided to compile the various viewpoints and send them to Chairman Zhang Junmai for decision. Jiang Yuntian will also go to Nanjing today, and Xu Chuanlin can fly from Guangzhou to Shanghai today. Furthermore, the Standing Committee of the China Youth Party resolved yesterday not to participate in the He cabinet, but to do its best to support it, and the party's Propaganda Minister Wang Shizeng issued a written statement on this.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper, Hankou, 18th] The Communist army in southeastern Henan province is moving southward step by step, and the threat to the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway is increasing daily.

<h3 id="e13">Embezzling 110 Million Yuan of National Funds: Censure of Sun Ke Established: Supervisory Yuan Members Request Severe Punishment and Prosecution <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Supervisory Yuan members Ni Bi, He Jizhou, Yu Peihou, and others filed a censure case against Sun Ke, the former President of the Executive Yuan, for withdrawing 110 million yuan from the Central Bank in the name of confidential funds. The investigation has been established. The full cause, facts, and reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>Cause: President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke recklessly spent a huge amount of national funds, turning public funds into private funds. It is urgently necessary to request the President to severely punish him, immediately recover all public funds, and send him to the judicial authorities for prosecution in accordance with the law in order to demonstrate the law and discipline and rectify political conduct.</p>
<p>Facts and Reasons:</p>
<p>The Central Bank received a secret letter from Finance Minister Xu Kan on February 15 of this year, stating: "According to the order of President Sun of the Executive Yuan on February 10: 'Immediately allocate 110 million yuan for the President's confidential funds to meet urgent needs, etc.', it should be obeyed. Accordingly, I am writing to request your bank to allocate the amount as requested. "On the same day, Luo Zongwen, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, issued a temporary receipt and obtained a promissory note No. 7516 worth 100 million yuan and a promissory note No. 75A worth 10 million yuan from the Central Bank. On the same day, the confidential fund of 110 million yuan was collected in full. The next day, February 16, the Bank of China presented the 100 million yuan promissory note for exchange and transferred it to the Sun Zhiping account (Sun Ke's son, China Industrial Bank official shareholder Huang) No. 52378 of the bank's current deposit account. On the same day, 14 checks were used to withdraw a total of 80,019,000 yuan. Among them, four transfers were made to Yongcheng account No. 53110, totaling 44 million yuan. One transfer was made by Huamao Bank for 1 million yuan. Nine cash payments were made, totaling 35,190,000 yuan. The deposits in the Yongcheng account were used to issue 15 checks on the same day, totaling 44,039,200 yuan, all of which were private financial enterprises. The Bank of China also spent 22,016,404.6 yuan on February 17 with five checks, totaling 102,220,064.6 yuan with 19 checks in two days. Another 10 million yuan promissory note from the Central Bank was also transferred to Zhao Jihao account No. 3408 of Anyu Qianzhuang (the number is for the Yuanchun stock exchange) on February 16 and was presented on the same day, and separately entered the Chongqing, Chunmao, Silk, Shengda, Hengda Banks and firms application forms, and Fuhua Tobacco Company, Xinfuji Food Shop and other accounts. Based on the above circumstances, it can be concluded that Sun Ke, by virtue of his position, recklessly used the name of confidential funds to secretly withdraw a huge amount of national funds from the National Action, turning public funds into private funds. The facts have become clear. At this time, when the foundation of the country is shaking and the people's livelihood is declining, and the general public and teaching staff are wandering around and calling out in the streets, Sun Ke, as the head of the government, brazenly disregarded everything and recklessly spent a huge amount of national funds, turning public funds into private funds, which is a great shame for all public and teaching staff across the country. It should be requested that the President severely punish him and immediately recover all public funds. His crimes of corruption and dereliction of duty should be handed over to the judicial authorities for prosecution in accordance with the law in order to demonstrate the law and discipline and rectify political conduct.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Chongqing Warship Sails in the Bohai Sea: Its Actions Cannot Escape Naval Headquarters' Control; If It Doesn't Return, It Will Eventually Be Bombed and Sunk <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The cruiser Chongqing is within the control range of the Naval Headquarters. Whether to bomb and sink it will be revealed in a few days. The location that can currently be disclosed is neither in Port Arthur (Lushun), controlled by the Soviet Union, nor in Dalian. This matter is sufficient to demonstrate that the Soviet Union does not want to cooperate regarding any trace of connection with the Chinese Communists. Therefore, the Chinese Communists had a surprised reaction of being at a loss after accepting this massive rebel ship. Their handling also fell into a state of panic and inability. They desperately wanted to take it in, yet feared that officers and soldiers within the original crew who did not agree with the rebellion would sail the ship to the government-controlled area. During the several days in Yantai Port, a portion of the Shandong sailors voluntarily returned to their hometowns, going to Huangxian and Longkou. Subsequently, the Communist army decided to send around 300 elite Communist soldiers to board the ship to assist, sailing it northward away from Yantai. The final fate of the ship will likely be like that of the Huang An, but before it sinks, the Naval Headquarters is still exerting its utmost to call it back via radio waves, attempting to summon this trump card.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The destroyer Huang An was a small ship of 1,000 tons. After it defected from Qingdao on February 12th, its whereabouts could not be ascertained. Subsequently, on March 14th, the Air Force dispatched transport planes carrying the ship's captain, Liu Guangchao, and others to patrol the east coast. They discovered this gray small ship outside Lianyungang. On the same day, the first batch of planes that went to drop bombs deliberately dropped bombs around the ship, forcing the ship to obey and listen to orders to return south. Unexpectedly, the ship's personnel, fearing punishment upon returning south, sailed the ship into the southern dock of Lianyungang and docked it after the planes left. The personnel then landed and fled. At this point, the Air Force knew that guiding the ship back south was hopeless, so on the 15th, they dispatched planes to bomb in shifts, hitting the deck on the ship's starboard side and the stern smokestack, causing the ship to tilt and partially sink. According to reports, only two naval ships defected: the Huang An and the Chongqing. The foreign reports of seven ships are inaccurate.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Interior Minister Hong Lanyou, since resigning along with Premier Sun Ke's cabinet, went to Shanghai to continue treating his chronic stomach ailment. A reporter recently visited to inquire about the recent impeachment by the Control Yuan regarding the Lan Ni dye case involving a letter from Hong to the late Director Wu Ren Cang. Hong stated that this matter was long before a year ago, and he had almost forgotten it had it not been brought up again. Recalling the time he wrote the letter, it was purely to urge the legal handling of the matter, and in terms of the tone of the original letter, words such as "examine and handle" and "decide" in fact did not imply any intention to intercede on her behalf.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Editorial: Starting with the Atlantic Pact <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Atlantic Pact, which has been brewing for a long time, has been scheduled to be signed in Washington next month on the 4th. The eight countries that initiated the pact, namely, Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, and Canada, have jointly invited Denmark, Iceland, Portugal, and Italy to participate in the signing ceremony. It goes without saying that the enthusiastic invitation of Denmark, Iceland, and Portugal is without a doubt, and even Italy has overcome the obstruction of the Italian Communists and decided to send representatives to Washington as scheduled. Although this Atlantic Pact is regional in nature, no one can deny the depth and breadth of its implications.</p>
<p>Standing from a third-party perspective, observing the content and function of this pact, one cannot help but say that it is a major achievement for Britain and the United States in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. It is expected that after the signing of the Atlantic Pact, other regional security pacts will be born one after another. The Mediterranean Joint Defense Pact sought by Turkey and the Pacific Pact or Southeast Asian League advocated by Britain have the potential to become a reality. However, Britain and the United States are advancing step by step in diplomacy, aggressively pressing forward, which will inevitably cause a serious reaction from the Soviet Union and deepen the deterioration of the world crisis.</p>
<p>The United Press reported from London on the 16th: Europe is suffering from a very heavy war phobia, and everyone has a feeling that a Soviet diplomatic crisis is forming. This abstract report, although inevitably has the suspicion of "alarmism," but it is not entirely groundless talk. We have synthesized recent international developments and can list the following facts to prove the accuracy of this statement. First, the five Western European countries (Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) have established a general defense plan, on the one hand, the five Western European countries are accelerating the reorganization of their armed forces, and on the other hand, they are asking the United States to supply weapons. Among them, Britain's active expansion of its air force is particularly noticeable. Second, Bulgaria and Hungary, with the tacit approval of the Soviet Union, disregard the military provisions in the peace treaties with Bulgaria and Hungary, and actively expand their armies; the existing army of Romania has also exceeded the limits stipulated in the treaty. Third, Iran will abandon the Soviet-Iranian treaty of 1921 and will form a military alliance with the United States, determined to coexist and die with Western countries. Fourth, the Turkish parliament also unanimously supports its Foreign Minister Sadak's pro-British and pro-American policy, and Foreign Minister Sadak plans to go to Washington in the near future to discuss the Mediterranean Joint Defense Pact with the American government and people.</p>
<p>The above facts all show the seriousness of today's world situation. The people of all countries in the world, after suffering the devastation of the first and second world wars, unanimously seek peace and yearn for stability, but the objective facts seem to be running counter to this common wish of mankind, moving further away from peace and closer to war step by step. From the perspective of Western countries, whether it is the formation of the Western European Union, the signing of the Atlantic Pact, or the conclusion of the Mediterranean Joint Defense Pact, they are all self-defense plans to ensure regional peace and security, and are limited to self-preservation only, without any aggressive nature targeting other countries. However, in today's world where bipolarization is becoming increasingly clear, the various arrangements made by Western countries in Europe, the Near East, and the Mediterranean, from another perspective, are nothing less than a thorn in the side. They either try to break the arrangements made by Western countries in various places, or they want to make an arrangement in other places to offset the effect of the other party's arrangements. I remember that when the Norwegian authorities were considering whether to jointly launch the Atlantic Pact with Western countries, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suggested to Norway that they conclude a treaty of non-aggression between the Soviet Union and Norway; and when the Italian authorities were studying whether to accept the invitation of Western countries to participate in the Atlantic Pact, the Italian Communist Party, under the instructions of the New Communist International, strongly obstructed it; and as Western countries were creating a favorable situation in Europe, the Soviet Union was actively creating a favorable situation for itself in Asia. All of these are sufficient to illustrate that today's world is under the struggle of two forces. If they can be evenly matched and create a balance of power, then world peace may still be able to linger and maintain for a period of time; conversely, if it loses its balance, then the international war that will be a disaster for mankind will be difficult to avoid and is even closer at hand.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the signing of the Atlantic Pact can be said to be a major arrangement for Britain and the United States in diplomacy, creating an absolutely favorable situation internationally; but things in the world often change when they reach the limit. If the Soviet Union is pushed to the end of the road, then there is a possibility of major changes in the international arena. It is not necessary to talk about the distant future, let's look at the near future. What has Asia become today? The capital of Myanmar has become an isolated city and is in imminent danger. If Britain and India cannot provide effective assistance, Myanmar will probably also change color. Other countries such as Malaysia, Siam, and Vietnam are also facing the same crisis. British and American diplomats may think of the signing of the Atlantic Pact as a diplomatic victory, and are smug about it, but they do not know that under the erroneous policies of the United States emphasizing Europe over Asia and ignoring the nature of the war in China, starting from the victory of the Chinese Communist army, the crisis in Asia has been deepening day by day, and this is the bad result caused by the British and Americans being busy making arrangements in Europe. We hope that British and American diplomats will face reality, have a long-term vision, look at the whole world, and quickly seek countermeasures to fill this huge gap in Asia. Otherwise, they will suffer the consequences and regret it too late!</p>

<p>Sixth Meeting of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The sixth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the morning of the 18th. It started at 9:15 a.m., with 182 members present and Tong Guanxian as chairman. After reporting on agenda items, the two issues proposed by the Program Committee were discussed. One was how the various committees of the Legislative Yuan should be reorganized. Many members spoke, and it was finally decided to first study and amend Article 3 of the Legislative Yuan's Organic Law, in coordination with the plan to simplify administrative agencies, which was the responsibility of the Legal System Committee, and to submit it to the Yuan for discussion within a week. The other was the draft Temporary Property Tax Regulations, which was decided to be referred to the Finance and Economy Committee for review. Secretary-General Chen Kewen read a telegram from Jiao Ciling Hongxun, stating that Minister Yu had requested leave, and Deputy Minister Ling was handling the handover in Guangdong. Regarding the inquiry on the price increase of railways, post, and telecommunications, Zhao ChuanYun, Assistant to the Director of the Road Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, Xue PinWen, Director of Postal Affairs, and Ji ShunTing, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau, were present at the meeting to explain. The members believed that those who reported to the parliament should be the ministers and deputy ministers, and other staff members could not be sent to handle it casually. This precedent could not be set and was unanimously rejected. Then, the discussion began on the proposal by Jin Shaoxian and others to request the Yuan to resolve and advise the President to declare the end of the period of national mobilization for the suppression of Communist rebellion in accordance with the law, and to immediately suspend the application of the provisional provisions during the period of national mobilization for the suppression of Communist rebellion. The members spoke one after another, and no conclusion was reached until noon. The meeting was adjourned at 12:00 noon. The meeting continued at 4:00 p.m., with 163 members present. Shao Jingren reported on the situation of receiving public servants who petitioned for reinstatement. The discussion on suspending the application of the provisional provisions during the period of national mobilization for the suppression of Communist rebellion continued until 5:30 p.m. before it was passed and referred to review. It was also decided that the 17 members who spoke and requested to speak today would be responsible for the review, with Xiao Juetian as the convener, and other members could participate freely. Afterwards, three more proposals were passed: (1) The proposal by Yang Yifeng and others to quickly and reasonably adjust the treatment of public school teachers nationwide was reviewed by the Western members of the Budget Committee and three members of the Finance and Economy Committee, with the members of the Budget Committee as the convener, and other members were free to participate, and a report was to be submitted to the Yuan within a week. (2) The proposal by Huang Tong and others to launch gold-priced deposits to stabilize finance, improve salary payment methods, protect savings, and unite the hearts of the military and civilians was referred to the Finance and Economy Committee for review. (3) The proposal by Wang Guangzhouqing and others to request the government to quickly determine a military reorganization plan, reduce the number of troops, tighten expenditures, verify salary payments, and reduce non-combat personnel as much as possible to save national funds was reviewed by five members each from the National Defense Committee, the Finance and Economy Committee, and the Budget Committee, with the National Defense Committee as the convener, and other members were free to participate, and a report was to be submitted to the Yuan within a week. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Li Shijun and Others Propose to Investigate National Property</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Legislator Li Shijun and others recently submitted a proposal to clarify the gold, silver, and foreign exchange payment situation of the national treasury, the number of currency issued, the actual situation of the use of US aid, as well as the handling of lend-lease materials, surplus materials, relief materials, and enemy and puppet property, as well as the current value, the capital of national investment enterprises, and the operation situation. It is proposed that the Yuan resolve and advise the Executive Yuan to quickly organize a national property investigation agency, divide into groups to thoroughly investigate, in order to rectify national finance and finance, and the Yuan will organize a special committee to study national property to discuss the above-mentioned events. The proposal pointed out that supervising national finance and controlling the national budget are important responsibilities entrusted to the Legislative Yuan by the Constitution. However, in the current situation, the budget is like a mere formality, and the effectiveness of laws and regulations is questionable. In order to get to the root of the problem, the existing national property should be thoroughly investigated first. At the same time, expenses that are not based on law should be removed and handled in accordance with the law, and those responsible for managing and operating national property who are found to be disloyal to their duties and cause losses to the country should be punished in accordance with the law, in order to stabilize the foundation of national finance and finance and to win people's hearts. In the method, it is also explained that the Executive Yuan should be consulted on the scope of national property investigation, paying special attention to: (1) The source of the national treasury's gold, silver, and foreign exchange income and expenditure, the situation of use, and the legal basis, the existing quantity level and location, and special attention should be paid to the central bank's sales and redemption details in recent years. (2) The number of currency issued, the situation of use, and the legal basis. (3) The capital and use of national banks. (4) The number of materials, value, and how they were used in the Lend-Lease Act, and the situation of entry and transfer. (5) The number and value of surplus materials allocated by the US military, how they were used, the existing number, and the situation of entry and transfer. (6) The number, value, and how they were used of relief materials, and how they were entered and transferred. (7) The number, value, and handling situation of enemy and puppet property received, with special attention to the investigation of warehouse materials, products, and factory property, how they are currently used, and the use and handling situation of enemy property materials received by military agencies. (8) The number and use of various domestic and foreign donations over the years. (9) Investigate national investment enterprises and loan enterprises, such as China Industrial Bank, Siming Bank, Commercial Bank, Guohuo Bank, and various enterprise organizations of China Textile Company, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Yuanling is Full of Wounds: Nine Out of Ten Homes are Empty and It Will Be Difficult to Restore Within Ten Years; The People Still Have Lingering Fears About the Burning and Looting <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Our Yuanling Dispatch, 18th] The reporter arrived in Yuanling at dusk on the 17th and entered the city by crossing the river from the wharf. The urban area has undergone a catastrophe and is a desolate sight. Scorched wood and dilapidated walls are everywhere. None of the shops and doors are complete. They have been looted more than ten or twenty times. It has now been a week since the bandits retreated, but only a few restaurants and hotels have opened their doors. The citizens are weeping on the roadside. They still have lingering fears about the burning and looting that lasted for ten days. On the 16th, the corpses of three raped women were found in a bunker in the western suburbs, and they had not been buried by the evening of the 17th. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yuanling became the political center of Hunan Province, with prosperous commerce. It was slightly inferior to the past after the victory, but it was still the largest city in western Hunan. This catastrophe has resulted in nine out of ten homes being empty, and it is difficult to hope for restoration within ten years. What the people of Yuanling are thinking about today is revenge. The county has more than 5,000 civilian guns and is brewing self-defense. There is a great feeling of lying in wait and biding their time, and the hatred between Yuan (ling) and Yong (shun) will probably never be resolved.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's Hankou dispatch, 17th] Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Corporation, recently came to Hankou to inspect the situation and transferred to Hunan for official business on the afternoon of the 17th. According to Wu's remarks before his departure: The Chinese textile industry is facing a serious crisis, the biggest reason being the shortage of raw materials and insufficient power. Based on the current cotton reserves in various factories, there is a shortfall of at least four months' worth of usage before the new cotton crop is available. Once the supply of raw materials is interrupted, it will not only indirectly affect the clothing of the military and civilians nationwide, but it will also directly plunge more than 700,000 employees engaged in the cotton textile industry in Shanghai into dire straits. He earnestly hopes that the military and political authorities in cotton-producing areas will cherish resources and encourage transportation and sales, in order to overcome the difficulties together. He also hopes that both the Nationalists and Communists will consider the hardships of the people and the difficulties of industrial construction, and not allow the remaining cotton-producing areas of Shaanxi and Hubei to suffer the disaster of war again.</p>

<p>[United Press, this city dispatch] According to Chinese individuals who recently came to Shanghai from Vladivostok: The Soviet Union is instigating anti-American sentiment among the people and, under the pretext of promoting peace, is urging the people to concentrate all their efforts to prepare for the "final and decisive world revolutionary battle." This person had lived in Vladivostok for as long as thirty years.</p>

<h3 id="e34">If Peace of Signatory Nations is Seriously Threatened: The United States Decides to Take Strong Action: After the Contents of the Atlantic Pact are Announced: Secretary of State Acheson Expresses a Stern Position <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] Washington, 18th: Acheson recently explained his views on the North Atlantic Treaty at a press conference, stating that if the Western European countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty are attacked, the United States will immediately join the war. He emphasized that, according to the treaty, the extent to which the United States should fulfill its obligations under the treaty should still be determined by the United States Congress. Acheson stated that if the signatory countries encounter a full-scale attack, such as what France encountered in 1914 and 1940, each signatory country should, based on its sincere judgment, decide what necessary steps should be taken to restore peace and security. Acheson stated that if the countries determine that the use of force is necessary, then this is also an obligation of the treaty. Acheson also stated that, according to the treaty, the United States is legally obligated to do certain things. Although no one can force the United States to take any action, he is confident that the United States will fulfill the promises in the treaty it has signed. Acheson also clearly pointed out the difference between attacks on signatory countries and so-called border incidents, and gave the example that "we would never use a sledgehammer to kill a fly." Therefore, when Japan sank the Panay gunboat, the United States did not take action, but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the United States took strong action. He stated that "we cannot predict the degree of importance of an event before it occurs, but strong action must only be taken when an attack has indeed threatened the peace and security of the signatory country being attacked." He believes that a purely domestic revolution cannot be considered an armed attack, but the situation is different if such a revolution is assisted by external forces. However, according to Article 4 of the treaty, if any signatory country believes that its political independence and security are threatened, the only obligation of the other signatory countries is to immediately hold consultations, not necessarily take action. Acheson also stated in response to questions that he believes that if aircraft transporting supplies to Berlin are attacked while passing through the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin, it should be regarded as an armed attack as referred to in this treaty. In his judgment, this action would be an attack on the occupying forces of the signatory countries.</p>
<p>Acheson also stated that if an attack occurs in an area outside the area designated by this treaty, and the signatory country is affected, the signatory countries should conduct consultations in accordance with the provisions of Article 4. However, the actions stipulated in Article 5 (including military assistance) do not apply to areas outside the area designated by this treaty.</p>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] Washington, 18th broadcast: Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the North Atlantic Treaty will be quickly approved by the Senate. Connally also stated that "quickly" means after the Senate has thoroughly listened to reports and debates. Connally stated: "The purpose of our participation in the North Atlantic Treaty is to seek peace and to resolve all international disputes through peaceful and legal means, without resorting to war. Now that the contents of the treaty can be published early, the people can understand its provisions before the Senate takes any action." Vandenberg and other members of the committee stated that they need to conduct a detailed study before making any comments. Representative Kee, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, stated that he believes the content is not strong enough. He believes that the treaty has placed a moral responsibility on the countries, but he himself hopes for a truly binding responsibility. Another member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mansfield, stated that the treaty could bring about some changes in the United Nations organization, making it an organization with the power to achieve world peace. Representative Fulton, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, believes that the treaty places too much emphasis on military aspects and too little on economic and social aspects, and expressed concern about the funds required for the treaty.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Signatory Nations of the Atlantic Pact: Will Establish a Defense Committee: To Specifically Study Various Measures of Military Mutual Assistance <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The most practical measure of the Atlantic Pact is the establishment of a defense committee. In fact, the core organization of this committee already exists, namely the U.S.-British-Canadian Joint Staff located in Washington, the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Board established before the United States entered World War II, and the permanent military organization of the Western European Union established under the Brussels Treaty.</p>
<p>After the tasks of these three organizations are combined, the Defense Committee of the Atlantic Pact is expected to be established at the time of the signing of the treaty, so that the order can start working after the treaty has been approved by the countries. Its immediate tasks are nothing more than: (1) determining the total military strength of the countries in the Atlantic Pact; (2) the portion that each country should bear in this total military strength and the assistance that the United States should provide; (3) how to allow new participating countries to join the Defense Committee; (4) how each country fulfills the legislative procedures to implement the aforementioned measures. In addition, the major issues that the Atlantic Pact will cause include the status of West Germany, Austria, and Trieste (because the signatory countries have occupying forces in those locations) and the issue of one of the signatory countries borrowing bases within the signatory countries. What is of most concern to the general public is the Soviet Union's reaction to the treaty. Some people predict that the Soviet Union will use the gap between the announcement and the signing to launch a surprising political counteroffensive. The announcement of the Eastern European Defense Pact can be regarded as one of its countermeasures.</p>

<p>[This newspaper dispatch] Washington, 18th broadcast: President Truman stated in Key West, where he is on vacation, that he "fully agrees" with the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] New York, 18th broadcast: Key West, Florida dispatch: Truman stated at a press conference that although Southern Democrats and other party members have expressed their opposition to him, he still hopes that most of his policies will receive the support of Congress. Truman stated: "The recent situation in Congress shows that the United States seems to be divided into three parties as it was during the presidential election last fall. These three parties are the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and the Southern Democratic Party." Truman's words indicate that he does not seem to regard the Southern Democratic Party as a true Democratic Party, but as another party.</p>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] New York, 18th broadcast: Lake Success dispatch: United Nations Secretary-General Lie indirectly expressed his approval of the North Atlantic Treaty at a press conference. He refused to directly express his opinion, but stated that he had received the final draft of the treaty two days ago. When a reporter asked him if he thought the treaty was necessary to maintain world peace, he replied, "The United Nations does not have an agency to maintain peace, and there is no United Nations force or army under the Security Council, but we do have a strong moral force. No fewer than thirteen incidents have been promoted to peace, including the Palestine and Kashmir incidents. Although the solutions cannot be considered completely satisfactory, each problem has been achieved to avoid war."</p>

<p>[This newspaper dispatch] Paris, 18th broadcast: A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the signing of the Atlantic Pact demonstrates the unity of nations within the United Nations that have the same cultural system and the same respect for human rights and love for freedom. Regarding the opposition of the Communist Party to this treaty, he replied, "This treaty is only aimed at aggressors. It is actually a defensive and peaceful treaty, which is indispensable in human history. If Hitler had known for sure in 1939 that the United States would eventually join the war, he probably would not have rashly launched the last world war."</p>

<p>[This newspaper dispatch] London, 18th broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin declared in the House of Commons this afternoon to cheers that the North Atlantic Treaty is an important step towards peace and security. Bevin said, "I am surprised that the facts are a historic event. I am not exaggerating when I say this. This treaty has really opened a new era of cooperation and mutual understanding. There are no secret clauses in this treaty, nor is there anything that could threaten the security and well-being of any country.</p>
<p>This treaty is a purely defensive action taken by the signatory countries for the sake of security. Any country that does not have aggressive intentions has no need to fear this treaty. It would be great if the United Nations organization could provide security and collective defense for all countries, but unfortunately, this is not the case so far, so this treaty is really necessary." Bevin also assured the dominions that we have always been concerned about the interests of the dominions when discussing this treaty. Of course we are concerned about their safety.</p>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] London, 18th broadcast: A government spokesperson stated that the United Kingdom will approve the United Kingdom's participation in the Atlantic Pact by an overwhelming majority. It is expected that only two Communist Party members and a few sympathizers will vote against it in the House of Commons. He said that the Atlantic Pact does not hinder the effectiveness of the British-Soviet treaty guaranteeing post-war cooperation, and emphasized that the treaty applies to the Arctic territories of Canada, Denmark and Norway. He also said that the West has troops stationed in Trieste, so Trieste will also be protected by the Atlantic Pact. Also, if Soviet Union attacks Berlin airlift planes, this treaty will also apply.</p>

<p>[This newspaper dispatch] London, 18th broadcast: Rome dispatch: After a 48-hour delaying debate amidst unanimous criticism from Communist Party members, the Italian Parliament finally passed a vote of 343 to 170 authorizing the government to participate in the Atlantic Pact, putting Italy on the same front as Western countries. Thus, the Italian Communist Party's struggle against the Atlantic Pact failed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 18th] The debate in the Italian House of Representatives on the Atlantic Pact has continued for 50 hours as of noon today and has not yet ended. However, many members have already shown signs of exhaustion, and have fallen asleep at their desks or leaned back in their chairs. At dawn, the total number of members in the hall was only about 50. Communist Party members have stated that they are determined to adopt various delaying measures to postpone the vote on the Atlantic Pact until after the contents of the treaty are announced. At lunchtime today, Prime Minister Gasperi almost collapsed, but he still stated that he would not leave the field until the vote was taken. He also declared that he would regard this vote as a vote of confidence in the government. Togliatti, the leader of the Communist Party who stood in opposition to him, also said that he would not give up until he achieved his goal, despite his eyes being bloodshot. In total, by noon, about 140 Communist and left-wing Socialist members had spoken, averaging five speakers per hour, and 54 people were scheduled to speak in the afternoon. At the same time, outside the parliament, military and police throughout the country intensified their vigilance to prevent incidents. Minor disturbances have occurred in Florence, Bari, Parma, and Naples. The Communist Party also plans to hold a large demonstration in Milan tonight.</p>

<p>Truman submits report to Congress</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman today submitted the sixth quarterly report to Congress on U.S. military aid to Greece and Turkey. It pointed out that the setbacks temporarily suffered by the Communist Party in the Greek civil war did not mean that the government forces could easily win. The work of training and equipping the Greek government forces has been quite successful, but there are still many unfulfilled tasks. Regarding aid to Turkey, the current focus is on helping Turkey strengthen its armed forces with equipment, materials, and technical assistance. However, so far, the equipment and supplies of the Turkish army have not yet reached a perfect state.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Department of State Information Officer McDermott announced today that the United States is considering aiding Western Europe, with the economy preceding military affairs. This principle will be the basis for the U.S. government's decision on appropriating cash and materials. The military aid to Europe plan will not hinder the European Recovery Program.</p>
<p>The United States is currently arming its friendly countries in Europe. The first step will be to supplement the shortcomings of the existing overseas troops. This is at least the policy for the first year of the future military aid plan, which begins on July 1. In the second step, the United States will supply guns, tanks, and equipment in order to establish new corps within the territories of Western European countries. The entire plan is to build a barrier to prevent the westward advance of Communism. McDermott's statement proves that the future U.S. military aid plan will be a cautious and long-term move, and does not want to rush to complete it. President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson both attach importance to European economic recovery. Truman has also specifically stated that the main reason for the United States to arm Western Europe is to eliminate the sense of insecurity that hinders the recovery plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Economic Cooperation Administration today urged Congress to quickly pass the second-year budget for the Marshall Plan so that it can be connected when the first-year funds are exhausted on April 3.

The second-year budget is 5.58 billion U.S. dollars, which is currently being discussed in the Senate and House subcommittee and has not yet been voted on.</p>

<p>[United Press, Pearl Harbor, 17th] Only four years after the United States seized hegemony in the Pacific Ocean from Japan, it has once again deployed a major defense line on that ocean all the way to its own west coast. Although the United States has reduced its army, navy, and air force in the East, it has not reduced its submarines, and its strength is still quite strong. The Pacific Command's envisioned defense line is Japan, the periphery of Okinawa, and the Mariana Islands. However, the cost of supplying and transporting this defense line is high. Military observers believe that once a future war breaks out, the U.S. West Coast industrial and aircraft factory area will be the target of enemy long-range bombers or submarine-launched guided bombs. The only way to deal with this type of attack is to deploy defenses in the possible areas of attack and in Alaska. The purpose of the westward shift of the naval and air forces of the Hawaiian Island base is to achieve this. Pacific Fleet Commander Ramsey announced that the Navy and Marine Corps Pacific Air Command are moving from Hawaii to San Diego. Therefore, the Hawaiian Islands will no longer have any value in being attacked when World War III breaks out. Observers expect that no enemy in the Far East will be able to pose a major threat to the United States on the Pacific Ocean. Although the U.S. fleet in the area is sparse, a large fleet can be assembled within 24 hours to deal with any possible maritime threats. With the main defenses of the United States deployed on the West Coast, the supply line is shortened, and enemy submarines will have no chance to succeed. Although the Soviet Union claims to have many new German-style submarines, it is feared that they do not have sufficient driving experience.</p>

<h3 id="e49">ICA Officially Announces US Rice Will Arrive on Schedule Next Month, Requesting Funds to Extend Rationing Plan <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Rumors have been circulating for days that US aid food and other materials will be temporarily suspended before Congress extends the Aid to China Act. This news has greatly affected people's morale, and food prices have soared. Yesterday, the ICA officially announced, in order to reassure the public, that the US-aided rice for April will be shipped to China on schedule to maintain the food supply in this city. Acting Director Griffin of the ICA also firmly guaranteed that the agency has sufficient funds to prevent the interruption of aid to China. The food rationing plan can be maintained until mid-May of this year, the US cotton supply plan can be maintained until early May, and the oil supply can last until early June. These actions are not affected by the congressional debate on extending the Aid to China Act. It is said that the ICA is requesting the head office to continue to allocate funds to extend the rice rationing plan until the end of June and to purchase more US cotton and petroleum products. Acting Director Griffin also stated that some people have been speculating on commodities in recent days, relying on the fear that US aid will be suspended. In fact, such speculation is unwarranted. We are well aware of the importance of the Aid to China program to the livelihood of Shanghai residents. If it is suddenly suspended at this time, it will inevitably deepen the suffering of ordinary people. Therefore, the ICA is working closely with the US Aid Utilization Committee to extend the period of assistance as much as possible under legal prerequisites.</p>
<p>Over 20,000 Tons of Siamese Rice Prepared for Shipment to China</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 18th] According to the US Embassy here, the local office of the US Commodity Credit Corporation is preparing to ship 26,000 tons of Siamese rice, a total of 52,000 tons, which is about twice the amount during the same period last year, when only 27,000 tons of rice were shipped to China. Since 1946, the Commodity Credit Corporation has been responsible for most of the rice purchased and shipped to China under the US relief program. According to the company's figures, as of the end of this month, Siam has directly received approximately US$47 million in foreign exchange under the relief to China program.</p>

In order to cope with this temporary situation, the Railway Bureau yesterday specifically notified all trains going to Nanjing that dining cars and water tankers should bring enough water for the return trip.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Qiu Huanxing, who used the alias Liu Zijin and served as a police officer in the North Station Police Branch, was originally a sergeant in the Forty-Ninth Army. On May 23, 1946, he was transferred to Shanghai and served as a sergeant quartermaster in the Independent Station of the Joint Logistics Headquarters. He had a dispute with Pan Muhua, the lieutenant quartermaster of the station. Later, due to poor service, he was dismissed from his position in July of the same year. He suspected that Pan had instigated the dismissal, so he and Bai Yukun, a private in the station, pre-purchased a pair of sharp scissors and secretly plotted to kill Pan. At around 7 a.m. on the 2nd of the following month, the two took advantage of Pan's deep sleep in the house and sneaked in together. Bai held down Pan's hands, and Liu stabbed him in the throat with the scissors, and Pan died. After achieving their goal, they fled separately. Later, Liu changed his original name Qiu Huanxing to his current name and was admitted to the North Station Police Branch as a police officer. He was soon found out about the previous incident and was transferred to the District Court for interrogation.

<p>— Jiang Xue</p>
<p>A Road Report About a City Before and After "Local Peace"</p>
<p>The place of detention was two thatched huts, each about one and a half square zhang, with wheat straw underneath, where we slept on the ground. When I arrived, there were already eight or nine comrades detained there, the longest had been detained for eight days, and had only been questioned once. After I arrived, everyone talked about their experiences of being detained, telling me many past situations, and in adversity, we all became friends. Following me were nine students, from Hubei, Sichuan, Guangdong and other provinces, all carrying passes, so there should have been no problem passing through. However, because they had previously studied after demobilizing from the Youth Army, they were detained. After they arrived, they were indignant, saying that their detention was unjustified, and their reasons were very legitimate! In the evening, ten more people came, including Yang Hongcai, the deputy commander of the Sixth Army of the Northeast. They had been trained in the Northeast, issued passes, and allowed to return home, but they were also detained. That night, there were more than thirty people in these two small huts. Imagine how they could fit. Everyone had to sit on the ground and could not sleep. In the middle of the night, the guard comrade came to lecture us, making everyone's mood very bad!</p>
<p>Those detained here were supplied with prison rations, corn buns and raw cabbage. I had never eaten corn buns before, and this time I got to taste them, which was a kind of life experience. But the next day, the news came that the superiors had issued a notice that prison rations would no longer be supplied, and we were not even given corn buns to eat. Therefore, they tried their best to relieve the prisoners. The students and Yang Hongcai and others were released one after another, leaving only nine people. That night, three more were released, leaving only six people.</p>
<p>It was heard that the director of the Public Security Bureau came, and he personally handled the matter. Therefore, many of those with lighter circumstances were released yesterday, and today others were processed. In the end, only I was left here. I was summoned by the director and talked to him for an hour or two. He said that their inspection work should only take two forms: either allow them to pass through or not allow them to pass through and order them to return. They should not be detained here like this. What crime is this considered!? He promised to handle it for me immediately, but it was delayed for another day. After being detained for a total of five days, I was allowed to go back. Then I passed through a certain place, and took a bus to Jinan.</p>
<p>Along the way, all the places I passed were old liberated areas. The land in many villages had already been distributed, while some had not yet been distributed. Land distribution was done by village. If the population of this village was small and there was a lot of land, then the amount of land per share would be more. If the population was large and there was little land, then the amount of land per share would be less. The usual situation was three to five mu of land per share, with each person, regardless of age or gender, receiving one share. The land distributed to soldiers serving in the army, if there was no labor force at home, would be cultivated by the whole village on their behalf. Thirty catties of public grain must be paid per mu of land, which is an obligation to the state. Now, because the army is moving south, preparing to liberate all of China, the Bohai Military Region is also implementing a policy of borrowing grain from the people to maintain government expenses.</p>
<p>The CCP's rural policy is relatively strict! These many old liberated areas have mostly undergone struggle sessions and purges. I asked a farmer if his family had been purged. He answered softly? His family used to have dozens of mu of land, but because of the purge, they now only have a dozen mu left. The rest of the furniture and clothing have also been purged. He also told me that there were cadres everywhere, and told me not to talk nonsense. When I was resting on the road, two children asked me for money. I was very surprised. Later, the landlady of the store said: their family used to be very well-off, but because they were struggled against, they are now beggars.</p>
<p>The CCP's power has penetrated into the countryside. The militia and village schools are their grassroots organizations and cadres, with a very strong controlling force. For example, this time the army moved south, they transferred many rural cadres to participate in the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign. These cadres are strong and powerful elements, which is a major force in the CCP's success. The people of each village regularly convene various meetings to solve their own problems, training every illiterate farmer or old woman to be able to use many new terms and speak out a lot of reasoning. In every newly liberated area, or newly captured soldier, a grievance session is held to tell of some of the pain he suffered in the past, and to place the responsibility for this pain entirely on the Kuomintang, in order to raise their vigilance and hatred, and to deal with the Kuomintang together.</p>
<p>The road from here to Jinan is very bad. Often, if you are not careful, you will get the car stuck there and cannot move forward. I arrived in Jinan on the evening of the 27th. I passed through several checks along the way, and they were all approved. I stayed in Jinan for two days, asking about the forward route, and decided to take the route through Qingdao. I took a train from Jinan to Weixian, and then took a bus from Weixian to Tongcun. Twenty miles east of Nancun is the National Army's defensive line. I passed through several checks along the way, but they were not as strict as Jiedi and Dezhou. I did not have a travel permit this time, but I was able to pass safely. I arrived in Qingdao on March 4th, stayed in Qingdao for two days, took a boat to Shanghai on the 6th, and arrived in Shanghai on the 8th. I was very lucky!</p>
<p>(9) After Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>I lived in Beiping for about a year and a half. Beiping was besieged on December 13th last year. I lived in this besieged isolated city for more than a month, personally experiencing the bloody smell of war. After the announcement of the local peace measures, and the entry of the Communist army into the city, I stayed in Beiping for nearly a month, seeing and hearing with my own eyes many facts about the realization of local peace in Beiping. At the same time, my contact area in Beiping was not too narrow. Of course, this report will be more true and consistent with the facts than those who only went to Beiping for a trip, or those who only saw a part of the surface phenomenon under surveillance and protection. In terms of the causes and consequences of the event, perhaps I can know a little more.</p>
<p>I used to be quite optimistic about the situation in North China. I believe that Fu Zuoyi's style, thinking, strategy, and the cooperation of the party, government, and military with him are more advanced, progressive, and capable than many military leaders and the political situation in various places across the country! In the many battles that were being lost all over the country, Fu Zuoyi's troops in North China won a lot of battles. Nie Rongzhen fought him and was always at a disadvantage. But the result was a local peace. Local peace is surrender. This has been proven to be absolutely true in the factual development in Beiping! What a tragic situation this is! The failure to decisively evacuate Zhangjiakou and concentrate the basic troops in Tianjin and Beiping to fight a real defense war was a major error in his strategic command, resulting in the irreparable failure that followed. The CCP also admitted that Fu Zuoyi still wanted to fight, but because of the losses and sacrifices in Chahar, he had to bow his head.</p>
<p>Beiping surrendered. But many authorities and people all over the country are still yearning for the local peace in Beiping. They are very concerned about the situation in Beiping. The local peace in Beiping has become a kind of "Beiping model." Therefore, I specially wrote this article. The atmosphere of national peace talks is developing intensely. It is reported that after the fall of Sun Ke's cabinet, the succeeding cabinet may appear in a "peace cabinet" posture. Everyone's hope for peace talks is obviously very eager! These many facts and emotions are similar to the situation in Beiping during the period of peace talks in the past. I am not opposed to peace, and I am a person who very eagerly hopes for permanent peace. However, the lessons of reality do not allow me to place greater hope on peace talks. The local peace led by Fu Zuoyi has become the "Beiping model," but there are no provisions to punish "war criminals" in it. For example, "war criminal" Fu Zuoyi himself is the opposing party in their peace talks. But Mao Zedong's eight-point peace declaration, the first point of which is to punish war criminals, is of course more than the conditions for local peace in Beiping! Today, the government's peace talks with the CCP are prepared to be based on Mao Zedong's eight-point peace declaration. Assuming that this peace talk can be negotiated successfully, will it be able to achieve better results than the peace in Beiping? Assuming that the Nanjing government immediately expresses its surrender to the CCP, I think the CCP will not be able to put forward more severe conditions than Mao Zedong's eight-point peace declaration! Many members of the literati class and the petty bourgeoisie, fantasizing about peace, often take one or two relatively emotional words from the CCP as a great spiritual comfort, and believe that the prospect of peace talks is very promising! This kind of erroneous thinking that ignores the essence of the problem and is obscured by surface phenomena will lead to even greater mistakes! The CCP's view of all problems is determined after scientific research and careful discussion, and is not determined by personal emotions at the moment. They are now engaged in a political struggle, dealing with problems by revolutionary means. The CCP's attitude is clearly expressed in the editorials of the Xinhua Daily, "Carrying the revolution through to the end" is their true attitude! Today, the Nanjing government hopes to achieve something in the peace talks, which is like a toad wanting to eat swan meat. I think the greatest achievement is only to delay time, so that they can prepare to complete, or even create some convenience for them to liberate the whole country. I personally do not have much hope for peace talks! The fragile will and emotional illusions of the petty bourgeoisie are sufficient to mislead people and the country today. Temporary respite is not a solution to the problem.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Blood Splatters Turtle Head Isle: Military Officer Xu Zhongli Meets Calamity, Singer Shen Lifang and Others Suspected and Detained <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Shi Wuwei</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 17th Dispatch] A shocking bloodshed case occurred on Turtle Head Isle in the Taihu Scenic Area on the morning of the 16th. The deceased, Xu Zhongli, was a military officer. He, along with Hua Zhichun, a senior staff member of Lixin Textile Factory, Yu Zongjie, and "Sweeties" singer Shen Lifang, Shen's cousin Yu Aju, and one other person, a total of five, were touring Feiyun Pavilion on Turtle Head Isle. Unexpectedly, joy turned to sorrow when Xu was suddenly attacked and shot three times, dying instantly on the spot. After the incident, Hua and the others immediately returned to the city and reported to the city defense inspection team. Team leader Guo personally led his team to hunt down the assailant. After searching for two hours without success, Hua and the other three were interrogated separately late into the night. They are now beginning to trace leads. According to Team Leader Guo's observation, the case is very complicated. It doesn't seem like robbery and murder, nor does it resemble a political assassination. In short, it's not a general bloodbath that anyone could encounter; rather, there is another reason. The deceased was the specific target. Hua, Shen, and the other three have been detained for further investigation due to the severity and high stakes of the case involving human life.</p>
<p>Lover of Elegance</p>
<p>Distinguished Couple's Spring Outing</p>
<p>Xu Zhongli, 35 years old, was from Anyue, Sichuan. In the spring of the 35th year [of the Republic], he came to Wuxi with General Mao Sen. Initially, he served as an inspector in the Wuxi City Defense Command, and then was reassigned as an intelligence staff officer. After the disbandment of the command and Mao's departure from Wuxi, Xu retired from the military and took on the role of the head of the employment guidance group at the Veterans Association, as well as the leader of the military training corps at the county's administrative cadre training institute. Last month, the county government recruited township self-defense deputy team leaders. Xu took the examination and was selected, being assigned to serve in the Zhongxiao Town area of Malu. However, Xu usually enjoyed frequenting singing halls, where he became acquainted with Hua Zhichun and Yu Zongjie, both senior staff members of Lixin Textile Factory. Hua was a renowned "filial son of singing halls." If he encountered a singer with a pleasant appearance, he would lavish her with praise and gifts without restraint. Initially, he pursued singer Tian Ying. After Tian left Wuxi, he turned to Shen Lifang. The night before last, Xu and Hua met again at the Sweeties singing hall. They were especially enthusiastic due to their long-awaited reunion. Subsequently, Hua proposed inviting Shen Lifang and others to tour the scenic spots. Xu and Shen were also acquainted, so it was agreed that they would meet at 8 a.m. the next morning at Shen's residence in the China Hotel. Yu Zongjie borrowed a car from the factory for their use. At 8:30 a.m., the group of five arrived at Turtle Head Isle.</p>
<p>Ambushed</p>
<p>Grieving Widow</p>
<p>After Xu and the others arrived at their destination, they followed the path up the mountain, climbing to the summit and enjoying the scenery to their hearts' content. When they reached the Lake and Mountain Restaurant at Feiyun Pavilion, they were all very hungry, so they each ordered a bowl of dumplings and noodles, enjoying a satisfying meal while overlooking the lake, making for a very pleasant experience. At the time, Xu sighed and expressed dissatisfaction with the current society, saying, "Here, I just hope to eat, drink, and be merry." Afterwards, they went to the nearby Lanfeng Pavilion for photography. Unexpectedly, just as they were in high spirits, five uninvited guests wearing short clothes and carrying short guns suddenly appeared, ordering them not to move. Then, the ringleader of the thugs robbed Xu of his Central Military Academy badge, a briefcase, a gold ring, and a watch, saying, "You guys are having fun while the situation is like this!"</p>
<p>Following this, they fired a shot at Xu, hitting him in the chest. Xu, clutching his chest, said, "We are all our own people, why is this necessary?" The thugs fired two more shots, and Xu fell to the ground. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the thugs told Hua and the others to leave quickly and not to report it. Hua and the others, still in shock, hurried down the mountain and returned to the city in the original car, reporting the truth to the city defense inspection team. Team leader Guo personally led his team to rush to the scene of the incident to search, but found nothing. Xu's body was transported back by car by Township Head Jiang of Zhongxiao Town and placed downstairs in the town government office to await the funeral. Xu's wife, Chen Peizhen (from Hunan), along with their five-year-old daughter, Yuan Ying, also arrived upon hearing the news, bursting into tears, a scene of extreme grief.</p>
<p>Strong Suspicion</p>
<p>Singer Detained</p>
<p>After Team Leader Guo returned to the team, he immediately summoned Shen Lifang and the other three for questioning. According to Shen's statement, she was 20 years old, from Shanghai. She originally worked as a singer at the Huadu Ballroom in Shanghai. Two years ago, she came to Wuxi and sang at Xianle. At that time, she met Hua Zhichun, who frequently came to support her. A year and a half ago, at a party held at the residence of Staff Officer Li Yuankai, she met Xu Zhongli and danced with him several times. Later, she returned to Shanghai and recently worked as a clerk at the China Shipyard. Because the factory was going to relocate to Taiwan, she asked for leave. On the 12th of this month, she was invited to Wuxi by Manager Jiang Xianji of Sweeties as a guest performer, preparing to return to Shanghai on the 15th. Coincidentally, Hua invited me to go sightseeing, she said. According to Hua Zhichun and Yu Zongjie, Xu Zhongli's visit this time was of his own volition.</p>
<p>Team Leader Guo</p>
<p>Reviews the Case</p>
<p>Team Leader Guo stated: He believes the inside story of this case is complicated and does not seem like robbery and murder, because if the purpose was to obtain money, at that time there were no tourists in the park, and the bandits could have searched and robbed at their leisure, but although the bandits searched Xu for weapons, they did not search him thoroughly, so a small gold bar and an oil shop bill on Xu's body were not robbed. At the same time, the bandits did not pay close attention to Shen Lifang's dazzling diamond ring, so it can be determined that the bandits' purpose was not to obtain property, and the robbery was merely a convenient act, or a cover-up. It also does not seem like a political assassination because Xu did not often go to Turtle Head Isle. It is impossible for the bandits to have planned an ambush there. According to Team Leader Guo's conclusion, the reason for the occurrence of this case should be sought outside of the two possibilities of political assassination and robbery and murder. It may be a vendetta, or it may involve other relationships. In short, it does not seem like an ordinary robbery case. The team has now obtained important clues and is sending personnel out to investigate, and the truth will soon come to light.</p>

<p>Respectful Letter, I have served in the education field in Northern Jiangsu in my early years, as an elementary school teacher. After the War of Resistance, I traveled to the rear, enduring great hardships. Unfortunately, I suffered from a stubborn disease—bone tuberculosis—lingering for several years. The medical expenses have been exorbitant, and due to circumstances at home, our family property has been depleted. The entire family's food and clothing are on the verge of destitution. White-haired elders and young children are crying for food, suffering from hunger and cold, urgently needing to make a living to take care of the family. I am moaning in bed, medical expenses require considerable funds (50 bottles of special medicine are needed), and for a time, I am truly unable to raise them. In desperation, I dare to ask your esteemed newspaper to appeal to people in society for help, so that I may continue to receive treatment, to avoid losing all previous efforts. If I can recover from my chronic illness, and have the skills to make a living in the future, I will certainly repay the amount in full, or in accordance with the principle of "gained from society, used for society," turn to helping the poor and sick. I would never dare to fail the great virtue of benevolent gentlemen. Respectfully addressed to</p>
<p>The Social Services Department of Shen Bao. Zhang Musheng, bowing respectfully, March 1st.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang's statement of poverty and illness, the investigation has confirmed that this is true. Therefore, the letter is disclosed, hoping that enthusiastic people will provide assistance. If you donate medicines or funds, they can be transferred by our department. (Editor)</p>

According to yesterday's method, silver firms with deposits every other day can receive 5% in cash and 25% in silver dollars of the deposit balance, totaling 30%. However, the maximum cash withdrawal is still 10%. If the maximum cash withdrawal is taken, the silver dollars will be reduced proportionally to 20%. Yesterday, each silver dollar was valued at 7,000 gold yuan. According to a spokesperson for the Central Bank, 300,000 silver dollars were issued yesterday. It is said that the silver dollars issued were still old silver dollars from the treasury, so they include various styles and are not limited to the "Boat Dollar."</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a relevant authority at the Central Bank, since national banks are issuing silver dollars to silver firms, if depositors of various banks cannot obtain cash, they can also apply to the original bank for silver dollars in proportion to their deposits.</p>
<p>The cash shortage in the Shanghai market continued yesterday. Cash discounts and acceptance bills are still popular. Retail prices on the market have discovered two types, one for negotiable instruments and one for cash, the former being about 10% higher than the latter. Salaried employees and ordinary citizens are complaining incessantly, hoping that the financial authorities will quickly find a way to improve the situation. According to the national bank, the cash shortage originated in other ports and has only recently affected Shanghai, and can be eliminated in a short period of time. However, according to general qualified financial personnel, the authorities' measures to tighten cash in order to prevent price increases are not thorough. Because not only has it failed to suppress the rising trend, but it has also contributed to it. Looking at the extent of daily price increases, we can know a general idea. Also, after the balance deposits turned over to the national bank by banks every other day are restricted from withdrawal, how can the interest on the deposited portion be passively sacrificed, so measures must be taken to compensate for it. The phenomenon of cash discounts is clear proof. The person believes that the way to stabilize prices is to reduce issuance and shrink the capital, there is no other good strategy. It is by no means possible to achieve an overall stabilization of prices by merely tightening cash. It is said that the degree of market price invigoration is too fast, resulting in decoupling from the amount issued, which is an undeniable fact. However, it cannot be solved by tightening cash, it depends on the issuing authorities responsible for using sophisticated techniques in advance and making full preparations.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] Outside, it is rumored that the Ministry of Finance has unofficially notified the Gold Industry Association to resume business on Monday next week. Yesterday, the reporter inquired again with a gold industry leader about the possibility of this statement. According to the report, the resumption of business sooner or later still depends on the registration of resumption of business by members, the progress of the arrangement and layout of the meeting place, and the fundamental issues such as installing telephones. If these factual obstacles can be overcome early, the resumption of business can also be realized one day earlier. At present, more than 30 members have registered to resume business. However, it is still impossible to confirm the exact date of resumption of business.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Chinese stock market was still weak yesterday. Gold outside the circle continued to rise sharply, and floating capital in the industry flowed out again. The money supply in the market was flat to flooding yesterday, and the supply source was even more vigorous. The interest outside the stock exchange was as low as 4 jiao, 3 and 4 jiao, 8 fen. However, because the overall situation was dull and the industrial and commercial crisis was fraught with ambushes, people had many concerns. Furthermore, it was Friday as usual, and many parties had to bear two days of interest, so many floating positions were closed and there were not many new buyers, and the market fell into a slump. The afternoon close ended at a low price. At the beginning of the morning, Yongsheng Yarn was bid out at a high price of 6 yuan and 7 jiao due to the trend of loose money supply. After the bid, the bidders started to pull up the price, rising to 6 yuan and 77 fen. The floating profits of the previous night were frequently sold, and the market softened, with a low of 6 yuan and 58 fen. Various parties absorbed again at low prices, and it rose again to 6 yuan and 68 fen. The securities gang sold hard, and the market fell straight, plunging to 6 yuan and 29 fen. Afterwards, the major players tried their best to tout, and the market rose again, rising to 6 yuan and 7 jiao, but it still did not get rid of the slump. Near noon, it was heard that the rumor that the national bank was selling gold was very strong, and people's hearts were shaken, and the trend plunged again, with a low of 6 yuan and 27 fen. Near the close, the trend of gold rebounded, and people's hearts stabilized slightly, and finally closed at 6 yuan and 4 jiao and 2 fen.</p>
<p>The small and medium-sized stocks opened fairly flat at the beginning, and followed the trend of Yongsheng Yarn in the middle. The trend was dazed and hovering, and the afternoon close also fell.

<p>The rising trend in the rice market has expanded. The money supply is loose and excessive. The price of gold is much higher than yesterday, so people's hearts are very firm and the owners are quoting very hard. The opening of the Nanshi market only rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Later, it was heard that the Beishi market rose more, so it went up again. The Booda once reached 50,000. The closing price was slightly back to 49,000 yuan, up 4,500 yuan.

The special japonica was as high as 52,500 yuan. The arrival of goods in the two markets was 8,215 shi.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The rising trend is even more severe. Because the money supply is still loose and the price of gold is high, retail investors take the opportunity to fight for it. The opening price did not rise much. Later, because the buying momentum was strong, it rose wildly again. Soybean oil rose from 186,000 to 197,000 at the close, an increase of 22,000. Rapeseed oil rose by nearly 20,000. Raw oil is a rare commodity, and a bucket of raw oil is as high as 260,000, a sharp increase of 45,000, reaching 20%. Soybean cake is up by 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The rising trend has not eased. The loose money supply remains the same. The Northern Gang continues to search vigorously.

In the middle of the process, the Fuxin factory sold about 3,000 to 4,000 packages, and the market once fell. The closing price finally rose again because the price of gold remained firm.

<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions saw liquidity and external factors remaining favorable for buyers. Confidence in higher prices persisted, and sales remained active. The process involved holding firm at current levels, ultimately resulting in an average price increase of approximately 50% for various yarns.</p>
<p>42-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn fluctuated from 3,140,000 yuan down to 3,110,000 yuan at the close, a rise of 140,000 yuan from the previous day.

<p>The cloth market continued to progress well, largely due to the abundant liquidity in the market (daily interest rates around 55 yuan). The Cantonese merchants maintained a strong interest in buying, but other groups showed little interest.

<p>The rayon market continued to be bullish yesterday, with vigorous price increases. In the morning, due to abundant liquidity, it was difficult to secure short-term loans, leading to a resurgence in buying interest.</p>
<p>120-count Toyo rayon opened at 2,200,000 yuan, briefly rising to 2,220,000 yuan. After reaching this high, sellers began to liquidate their positions, and external gold prices retreated slightly. Market sentiment turned weak, and a soft wind began to blow across the stagnant market. Bids gradually drifted lower, reaching 2,160,000 yuan at the midday close, and finally closing at 2,100,000 yuan. In the afternoon, liquidity remained high, and buying interest was still strong, initially bidding at 2,200,000 yuan, then rising to 2,290,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The silk and satin market saw weak buying interest yesterday, with actual sales lackluster. Market supply and demand shifted, resulting in sluggish absorption. Prices retreated after reaching high levels, and the close was quite mediocre. "Meiya" silk opened in the morning at 1,110,000 yuan, then weakened, with market sentiment declining to 1,085,000 yuan. Subsequently, local demand picked up slightly, and bids rose slightly to 1,100,000 yuan at the midday close.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Exported Crated Tea Stagnant <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to sources familiar with the tea industry, although the prices of red and green teas have been increasing daily since sellers began using exchange transfer certificates to offset valuation losses, the price of exported crated tea is becoming increasingly out of line with international tea prices, deterring buyers. This has resulted in a near-tragic situation for recent exports of Chinese tea, and the outlook is not optimistic. Domestic tea sales are also mediocre, with few transactions and rapidly rising prices.</p>
<p>Another report: Local shops, feeling that the continuously soaring tea prices are making it difficult to cover costs under previously agreed-upon prices, have, starting today, authorized the guild to revise prices again to provide relief, increasing them by about double compared to before. It is reported that the minimum price for Longjing tea is 3,200 yuan per catty, and the maximum is 48,000 yuan. The minimum price for black tea is 1,600 yuan per catty, and the maximum is 32,000 yuan. The minimum price for jasmine tea is 1,600 yuan per catty, and the maximum is 32,000 yuan. Gongju chrysanthemum is priced from 3,200 yuan to 9,600 yuan per catty, and white chrysanthemum is priced from 1,920 yuan to 2,560 yuan per catty.</p>

<p>The price of tung oil continued to rise in yesterday's market, due to the extreme abundance of liquidity within the industry and the upward movement of commodities outside the industry. At the same time, it was reported that the production price of tung oil in Hankou was still being quoted in silver dollars, causing confidence to increase rapidly, as if having broken free from reins. Near the close, prices rose again by 20,000 to 25,000 yuan. However, buyers, constrained by narrow domestic and foreign sales channels and weak demand, resulted in continued sluggish transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Commercial Briefs <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the price increase trend has become more severe. Many local businesses and companies are abolishing the practice of marking prices on goods in response to the market situation. Some are assigning numbers to goods, but without directly marking prices.</p>
<p>Taxi fares in the city are being adjusted from today. Twenty minutes will cost 6,000 yuan, with an additional 5,000 yuan for every additional five minutes. One hour will cost 18,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The price increases for cigarettes, soap, and matches have slowed slightly. Various grades have risen by only 100-200 yuan. Morning trading opened steadily, with continuous sales of distributed goods. Holders, due to interest rate relationships, were unwilling to easily sell off their holdings, and bids rose slightly, but the increase was not enough to cover interest expenses. "White Tin Package" cigarettes were priced at 8,450 yuan, up slightly by 200 yuan. 20-count "Great Britain" cigarettes were priced at 3,550 yuan, also up by 100 yuan. Other grades generally saw modest gains. "Guben" soap saw strong buying interest, with prices exceeding 70,000 yuan, reaching 72,000 yuan, up by 3,000 yuan. Assorted brands generally showed strength. Hot-selling match brands generally fell, while assorted brands generally rose by 20,000-30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Market Stroll: Watching the Scalpers <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Big bills, come out now! Don't be coy! Snatching silver dollars – the "scalpers'" business – society is so merciless!</p>
<p>Silver dollars are the medium for small clerks to preserve currency value and to make a living day by day.</p>
<p>The cost of living index this time, as we analyzed the day before yesterday, the discount on the index itself, the discount on the continued rise in prices, is virtually halved. In addition, it coincides with the soaring price of silver dollars and the panic of cash. Salaries are paid in promissory notes, and silver dollars must be purchased with cash. Therefore, exchanging promissory notes for cash requires an 80% discount. With silver dollars rising by as much as 40% in recent days, it is equivalent to another 60% discount.</p>
<p>After careful calculation, this time the salary of 100,000 yuan for middle and upper-level employees is actually not worth even 20,000 or 30,000 yuan; it is truly a hard blow.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank released more than 300,000 silver dollars. Is it lacking head money in large bills? Or is there still a need to scour cash?</p>
<p>For days, the Central Bank has allocated gold, limiting the receipt of cash. It is said that it released silver dollars to banks to alleviate the cash panic in various banks.</p>
<p>If banks use silver dollars to pay salaries, it will indeed help alleviate the cash shortage. But those who are relieved are limited to internal employees of the banks, and manufacturers still cannot figure out a solution.</p>
<p>In fact, why bother to learn from the bound feet, a clear article has been announced long ago to issue big bills. Asking commercial groups to request the issuance of big bills, this kind of trick is pointless and few people will have the courage to do so again.</p>
<p>The trend has been straightened out, we can speak frankly; issuing big bills will definitely increase prices. Not issuing big bills, the cash shortage is the cash shortage, and the price increase is the price increase, horizontal increase and firm increase are still increases, why add a cash shortage with twisting and pinching? Moreover, in today's style, the Central Bank cannot be suspected of controlling cash to earn arbitrage. If there is suspicion, regardless of whether it is true or false, the Central Bank authorities are always wronged? That's even more sympathetic!</p>
<p>Everyone is talking about silver dollar scalpers. "Scalpers" has a contemptuous tone. In fact, they just don't have a lot of capital to do business, but their business methods are really no different from the managers and directors of large companies.</p>
<p>I don't intend to defend them here. I want to talk about their bright future.</p>
<p>In this situation, small clerks used to hoard food and buy soap, but now their vision has to become shorter and shorter. Although they are unwilling to keep paper money in their hands, they have to keep money in their hands that can be carried with them.</p>
<p>Gold and US dollars are the kings of money, but small clerks don't dare to touch them, so they naturally have an indissoluble bond with silver dollars.</p>
<p>Now, most of the general clerical class buy silver dollars with their salaries, and each person is buying groceries with silver dollars. Buying them all at once, and each person is going out; every silver dollar vendor will be like the money exchange shops of the past.</p>
<p>It is precisely because silver dollar transactions have a bright future that the establishment of a gold and silver market has the effect of dividing its benefits. Think about it, even these benefits are not allowed to be done by these unemployed citizens. The degree of social ruthlessness and coldness is also conceivable!</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to reliable sources: Because the Central Bank's remittance income in recent months has still not reached the expected target, it has changed the overseas remittance listing method in the past week. In the six overseas remittance ports of Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Wuzhou and Qingdao, the Central Bank examines the actual situation of the local area and lists prices separately. At the same time, the Bank of Communications assists in collecting remittances in the six locations. The purpose of this move is to make the overseas remittance rate and the national bank that handles foreign exchange in various markets, so that overseas remittances can flow back to the motherland through the national banks that handle foreign exchange, and increase foreign exchange resources. This method has been implemented on a trial basis for a week and has achieved good results. Once it has achieved considerable results, the entire implementation method will be officially announced. It is heard that in the past week, the income of overseas remittances has been greatly reduced because the overseas remittance price has failed to meet the reality, and only a few hundred thousand US dollars were received for the entire month.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Overseas Remittance Income Has Not Increased, National Bank Changes Listing Method <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Gold Management Bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the financial reform case stipulates that people are allowed to freely buy and sell gold and silver, and the national banks can also buy and sell gold and silver to stabilize the market price of gold and silver. However, if general silver banks and financial institutions are allowed to purchase and sell gold and silver in large quantities, it is not in line with the normal operations of the business. In order to implement the policy of stabilizing finance, it is specifically stipulated that banks, except for those with special permits, are still not allowed to buy and sell raw gold and silver. Those who violate this will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Banking Law. The 38-year short-term gold bonds issued by the government are securities. Silver banks and financial institutions can buy and sell securities within their approved business scope, and they should be allowed to buy and sell gold bonds. However, after the protection is due in the middle of the period, the gold obtained from the repayment of principal and interest and the transfer form thereafter shall be reported to the Ministry for verification. After receiving the order, the Bureau has ordered the three guilds of silver, money, trust, commerce in the city to inform their members to comply with it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the National Bank continued to allocate the original gold to the bank building. At 11:00, it allocated 150 taels at the then current price of 484,000 yuan per tael. In addition, the bank continued to sell gold to other markets in succession, totaling more than 50 taels, with varying prices.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Today's Grade A Football: Jingwu Faces Zhichao Again <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>There is only one Grade A football league match today, held at the Yiyuan Stadium at 3:00 PM, where Jingwu Club will once again face Zhichao Club.</p>
<p>In the first week of the special round-robin tournament, Jingwu initially scored two goals, but Zhichao caught up with three, turning defeat into victory. Further, riding the momentum of breaking the leader's dominance, led by iron defender Wu Qixiang, they have made significant progress in technique. The whole team prioritizes defense over offense. Wu Qixiang, stationed at the third inner defense, is like a natural barrier. If Jingwu's young players want to break through Wu's heavy defense from the middle, it is akin to making a mosquito carry a mountain or a toad swim a river. With the support of the veteran Wu, the midfield line has gradually become stable, and the young players in the forward line are quick enough to advance. However, they tend to be overly focused on ball control. Right winger Shang Shiqi has good footwork, enough speed, and delivers crisp passes. If Zhichao's offense can receive a steady stream of crosses from Shiqi, Jingwu's penalty area will inevitably face a severe threat.</p>
<p>Jingwu's young players are not always consistent in form. At their best, they have forced a draw with Qingbai. When out of form, they are disorganized and chaotic. If Ma Qunxian can return in time from Hong Kong, the forward line can be strengthened. However, he also tends to be overly focused on ball control, wasting time and hindering efforts. If they attack from the middle, it would be akin to attacking strength with strength, which is definitely not the best strategy. They should use the flanks more to restrain Zhichao's inner defense, creating opportunities for activity within the penalty area. The defense is quite balanced, but the offense is relatively weak, not enough to break through Zhichao's defense. Therefore, Jingwu's young players must have a fearless spirit and fight to the end to avenge their previous defeat.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Pan team eliminated Public Transport with a score of 4-1 in the South City, winning the right to the loser's final. They are scheduled to hold the loser's final with Gonghexing next Wednesday (23rd) at 4:00 PM. The winner will then face the losing team in the regular final next Friday (25th) at 4:00 PM to determine the runner-up and the qualification for promotion to the senior group. The dates of this competition will not be changed unless it rains. Because the senior group has been decided to open next Saturday (26th)</p>
<p>Those who are confident of being promoted to the senior group (Daxia has already qualified regardless of the outcome of the final) are required to replenish the total number of 20 people once again after the first competition in the senior group in accordance with the resolution of the representatives of each team. I hope that the personnel selection and photos will be prepared as soon as possible to complete the registration procedures as scheduled to increase the strength, so that a balanced situation can be created in the senior group and the interest in competition can be improved.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xu Heming of Public Transport opened the scoring, and Zhang Xiaofei of the Pan team equalized. After switching sides, the Pan team showed its strength, first with Qian Mingyuan's shot scoring, taking a 2-1 lead. Then Qian Changxing and Zhou Liuxiong both scored with headers, resulting in a 4-1 victory. Both sides played well.</p>

<p>[British News Agency, London, 18th] This year's British racing season began on the 17th. As usual, the first event held each year is the Lincoln Race, which includes the famous Lincolnshire Handicap, which will be held on Saturday and will coincide with its 100th anniversary. But the history of horse racing in Lincolnshire is more than a century old. According to the city hall records, a certain expense was approved in 1597 that was related to horse racing. Another record states that King James I of England visited the Grand National Race in Lincoln, but it was not until 1680 that it was regularly held every year. The history of British horse racing is even earlier than the dates recorded in these ancient archives. When the Roman authorities governed Britain as a province of the Roman Empire, horse racing was a common sport. According to historical records, organized competitions were held more than 1,700 years ago at a location where steeplechases are still held today. British horse racing affairs are managed by an organization called the "Jockey Club." This club was established 200 years ago. The Grand National Race held in Epsom every June may be the most famous horse race in the world. This is a national event. Even those who do not usually ask about horse racing often bet on this race. Those who attend the race can see a unique, colorful, and magnificent scene in British sports life.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Sports World: Three Basketball League Matches Tonight Shanghai Police Re-Encounters Peifeier John Faces Li Team in Women's Group <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>There will be three basketball league matches today, starting at 5:30 PM for men's Grade A, Grade B, and women's groups, continuing to compete at the Municipal Gymnasium. Tickets remain the same, 500 for upstairs, 1,000 for downstairs, and 1,500 for numbered seats inside the arena. The order and referee list are as follows:</p>
<p>Li Team——John (Women's Group) 5:30 Referee Liu Hesheng Wu Zibin</p>
<p>Shantou Team——Chongde (Grade B D) 6:15 Referee Zhou Huaibang Xuan Zhijie</p>
<p>Shanghai Police——Peifeier (Grade A Group) 7:15 Referee Jin Botao Hu Zongfan</p>
<p>In the opening match of the women's group, Li Team will face John again. According to the initial match between the two teams, John defeated Li Team 41-28. However, John has only won this one game in six games. After playing Li Team tonight, there is only one game left against Xinghua, so the victory or defeat will be related to the golden parcel. If they fail, they will have the same score as Li Team. However, John has good players such as Li Senlin, Jingyi, and Zhang Luoluo, so victory is expected. Li Team is weaker in strength. In addition to Fan Yuying and Liang Miaozhen, their experience is insufficient. However, the team has an excellent spirit. They have been defeated repeatedly, but their courage is unabated. When the time comes, they will resist to the end, and there will be a fierce competition.</p>
<p>Next, the Shantou team will play against Chongde in Group B D. The former has played twice, with half wins and half losses. The team originally had a considerable history in Shanghai, but after reorganization, talents were scattered. Although Chen Qingjiang, Zhou Bin, and Zheng Guofan are old partners, their cooperation is not as good as before. Today's game against Chongde, Chongde has lost both games in this group, and their fighting power seems to be the weakest. However, they will try to cheer up after being defeated twice and do their best to compete with the Shantou team, so the number of wins and losses is unpredictable.</p>
<p>The finale is the Grade A group Shanghai Police and Peifeier meet again. According to the first cycle, Peifeier was defeated by the Shanghai Police, losing nine points. However, since entering the second cycle, they have defeated Hualian, won against Haiqing, and defeated Mailing Max three times to avenge their previous defeats. The often defeated team has changed into a winning team. Captain Kelle Black Carbon Brown is playing better and better, and Icart Glagich Yexiang cooperate with each other, and their cooperation skills have also made great progress. Shanghai Police is their enemy, and they must seek revenge when they meet again this time. The Shanghai Police has been quite disadvantaged in the second cycle, suffering a defeat to Mailings and a crushing defeat to Encas, while they were all defeated by Shanghai Police in the first cycle. Tonight is another time to defeat the invading army. Learning from the past and being wary of the future, Jin Gui, Bowen, and Qixia should plan early to defeat the enemy and restore their reputation. When the time comes, the mighty forces from the East and the West will put on a tight performance in a battle of dragons and tigers. The rosters of the six teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Li Team) Weng Xiayun, Wang Jiahua, Liang Miaoling, Yao Wenda, Liang Miaozhen, Fan Yuying, Chen Shanbao, Liu Danzai, Zhang Shanfu, Zhou Younan.</p>

<p>— Public Translation</p>
<p>Figures two and three illustrate two basic zone defense formations. When the ball is passed into a specific area, the defensive formation shifts in accordance with the ball's location.</p>
<p>These two formations clearly divide the three defenders into three lines of defense. (Figure two) When the ball is passed by the offensive team's center to the right side of the basket, the right defender forms the first line of defense outside the free-throw circle line; the center defender is positioned on the free-throw line to form the second line of defense, and the left defender is positioned at the corner of the semicircle to form the third line of defense. She is the last line of defense, guarding the area under the basket, preventing the offensive players from shooting or tipping the ball into the basket.</p>
<p>Figure three depicts the opposite formation. When the ball is put into play from the center circle and passed to the left, the left defender sets up the first line of defense, the center defender remains in the second line of defense, and the right defender is the last line of defense. By observing the dotted lines on the court in Figure one, it becomes clear that the defenders move according to the ball's location, similar to the formations in Figures two and three.</p>
<p>The third basic movement is illustrated in Figure four. When the offensive player holds the ball in the central area, the defensive formation only needs to make simple movements. It remains divided into three lines of defense. The right defender stands at the top of the semicircle, forming the first line of defense, the left defender sets up the second line of defense behind the free-throw line, and the right defender guards the third line of defense under the basket. In this situation, the defenders only need to guard the offensive player holding the ball. They do not need to follow the other offensive players who do not have the ball. The most important thing is to firmly guard their assigned areas. When the ball reaches another area, the defender in that area must quickly arrive at the location of the ball. However, it is not advisable to move too early, as this would create an opening for the offensive player to cut in. The defenders should remain calm and avoid being deceived by feints, which could lure them away from their assigned areas. If they can accurately predict the offensive player's movements, they may even be able to intercept a pass.</p>
<p>Following this formation for defense, as soon as the ball leaves the hands of the offensive player, the defender guarding her must immediately retreat and adopt a moving zone defense based on the ball's location.</p>
<p>Offensive players may sometimes employ three forwards clustered in one area to launch an attack. The moving zone defense must be effectively used to defend against this offensive tactic, which relies on the second line of defense as its backbone. The defender in this line must have sharp judgment, be clever and agile, and time her movements perfectly. If she possesses these skills and performs reliably, acting as a pillar of strength, the defense can remain as solid as a rock.</p>
<p>However, it is important to remember several key principles. The defender's strategic key area is a zone with a radius of fifteen feet, with the free-throw line as the central point. The defensive work should employ delaying tactics rather than decisive actions. The goal is not to immediately steal the ball but to delay the offensive player's scoring opportunity. It is crucial to remember the moving zone defense. If the ball is in the eastern zone, the defender in the eastern zone rushes towards the ball-handler, while another defender fills the defensive line that the first defender is responsible for guarding. This is a unified effort of three, requiring coordinated communication to form the entire defensive formation.</p>
<p>The diagram illustrates an offensive forward holding the ball. The right defender sees the ball's location and rushes forward to guard her. If the offensive player passes the ball to another offensive player who is only a few feet away, the right defender must immediately shift her position to guard the player now holding the ball. The center defender and the left defender also shift their positions to the right, acting as a fan-shaped movement.</p>
<p>If the offensive player passes the ball to another offensive player standing in a more distant and deeper area, the responsibility of filling that space falls on the center defender guarding the second line of defense, who moves forward to the right as much as possible to guard the ball-handler. (To be continued. Four)</p>

<h3 id="e120">Record of Salary Depreciation <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>This happened around the time of mid-month payday.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 14th, several colleagues, with serious expressions, held a meeting for most of the day, earnestly discussing how to handle the upcoming salary. Of course, everyone knew that the amount was small and not to be overly hopeful about, but they still wanted to create some "miracles" with this meager sum to help supplement the expenses of half a month. Among the various opinions on gold, goods, and short-term interest rates, there was unanimous disgust and rejection of "Yuan Datou" silver dollars, with everyone saying they would never fall for the "fool's head" again. "Look, the 'Big Head' was already 1,600 at the beginning of last year, and in the following month or so, it only fell, never rose. Last time, a bit of 'contingency money' was all used to buy 'Big Heads.' Bought at 1,600, sold at 1,400. It was truly tragic, infuriating, and resentful!" - This was everyone's collective opinion.</p>
<p>The meeting continued. For the sake of caution, the possibility of "Big Heads" rising in the coming days was reviewed and studied for about half an hour. No one could think of any reason for it to suddenly soar.</p>
<p>On the night of the 14th, I suffered from insomnia for two hours. The reason was: buying "Big Heads" was most suitable for our kind of status; buying anything else would require finding connections and a larger sum of money. But after careful consideration, I felt that we should learn from past mistakes and not support Yuan Shikai's brain, only to suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th, I washed my face, skipped breakfast, and rushed to the office to collect my salary. Everyone no longer considered "Big Heads." They unanimously thought that the Central Bank would dump a large amount of gold, credit would tighten, and it would be better to put it into "weekly deposits." This was easier to handle and wouldn't be "too much of a loss." At least, it could maintain some of the currency value. Some people preferred to put it into short-term interest rates, even if it meant not buying oil, rice, firewood, and salt for their families.</p>
<p>What was the result? After noon on the 15th, "Big Heads" jumped from 44 to 48. By the evening of the 16th, they had reached a peak of 65, rising faster and more violently than gold and banknotes, and dwarfing the short-term interest rates of "weekly deposits." Thus, I was once again infuriated and resentful!</p>
<p>"Look, whatever we buy doesn't rise; whatever we don't buy rises! It's clear that scholars seeking profit are like scholars rebelling - in the end, they accomplish nothing!"</p>
<p>In fact, the reason for this is worthless: all the factories, stores, and public institutions in Shanghai all pay salaries on the 15th. Civil servants take this small amount and have no other ideas for making a profit, so naturally they still buy "Big Heads." So how could "Big Heads" not rise madly? How could I have stayed up all night, held a meeting for half a day, and still not figured out these principles?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I could only tap my own not-so-big "head" helplessly, pick up my pen, and write an article for "Free Talk," partly to vent my anger and partly to earn a bit of稿費(稿費 is untranslatable but it roughly means payment for submitting articles), to make up for the loss.</p>
<p>Yuan Datou, wrongly headed, resentful head!</p>

<p>— Sima Niu</p>
<p>There was a merchant who wanted to count ten billion banknotes to see how long it would take, so he decided to experiment. He took a hundred five-yuan banknotes and counted them one by one. After counting them, he recorded the time it took. Then, he assumed he had to count ten billion yuan of five-yuan banknotes, working eight hours a day, six days a week, and calculated the time it would take based on the time it took to count just now. The answer was exactly thirteen years.</p>
<p>Alas, this is why large denomination banknotes have to be issued!</p>

<p>The uniforms of the criminal courts in our country use three colors, blue, white, and red, for trimming, which is determined by the colors of our national flag "Blue Sky, White Sun, Red Earth," with profound meaning.</p>
<p>The trimming of the judge's uniform is blue, to show impartiality and express the spirit of integrity of the so-called "Blue Sky."</p>
<p>The lawyer's duty is to protect human rights and uphold justice, shining on humanity like the white sun, so white trimming is used.</p>
<p>The task of the prosecutor is to eliminate corrupt officials and sweep away the dregs of society, so red trimming is used to express his spirit of courage and inviolability.</p>

<p>— Chen Yi Xian</p>
<p>Confucius said: "It is better to have no ruler in All of China than to have a ruler among the barbarians." "No Ruler in All of China," at the time people took this as equivalent to "A Dream of Yellow Millet." All refers to Zhu Zhen Zhuang, Xia refers to Xia Jing Guan. Zhu had passed away for many years, Xia is still alive and well. People only know that the two were known for their poetry, but they do not know that both were revolutionary practitioners. Xia served as secretary to Su Fu Cheng Dequan. In 1911, Dequan responded to the Wuchang Uprising led by Li Yuanhong, and Xia played a significant role in it. During the late Qing Dynasty, Feng Qijun (zi Shaozhu, from Guangdong), the Hubei Provincial Police Commissioner, although corrupt and lecherous, with a notorious reputation, was extremely alert and capable. Many members of the party were harmed by him. When Rui Cheng arrived, he first impeached him, and Zhu Zhenzhuang supported this from the sidelines. Feng Qijun was succeeded as Police Commissioner by Huang Zuhui, a kind and honest elder. The success of the uprising in one day and night was not unrelated to this. If Feng Qijun had still been serving as Police Commissioner at that time, the situation might have changed, which is unknowable. Rui Cheng fled, but Zhu Zhenzhuang did not become prominent. He secretly helped members of the party, and did not claim credit for his achievements, which was especially rare.</p>
<p>"A Dream of Yellow Millet" refers to Huang Jun and Liang Hongzhi, which the world knows. Huang, after one term, transferred to the university, while Huang graduated from the translation school, one class ahead of me, and was a B-level student. Liang's poetry collection, Aiju Ge Poems, and Huang's notes, Flowers Accompany People (the so-called "Flowers" refers to Liang Cuifen, a famous courtesan from the north, whom he took as a concubine), were both famous at the time. But the fates of both men turned out like the prophecy of "A Dream of Yellow Millet," ending badly, which is strange and tragic. How can this be compared to Zhu Zhenzhuang and Xia Jingguan’s deeds, which are worthy as historical materials for the revolution?</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Mystery of Animal Energy <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Yi</p>
<p>Just as humans are boasting about the discovery of atomic energy, the animals in the universe have long possessed amazing skills. A certain type of bird, smaller than a robin, makes two non-stop flights of two thousand miles each year; a certain insect can jump a distance more than a hundred times its body length, and jump to a height five hundred times its body height. The beetle is also a miracle; it can lift something weighing five hundred times its own weight.</p>
<p>Where this energy comes from remains a mystery. If we humans could learn the beetle's ability, we could easily lift thirty-six tons of weight, or jump over skyscrapers.</p>
<p>The golden plover of Alaska flies back and forth to the Hawaiian Islands every spring, flying non-stop over two thousand miles of landless ocean. Because birds' beaks are not suitable for catching insects in the air, it can be determined that they do not eat anything during long-distance flights. So, where does enough energy come from for them to expend?</p>
<p>Long ago, the famous French entomologist Fabre spent years patiently observing the small animals in his garden. He noticed a young scorpion, which, although it had not eaten food for a week after birth, was still able to move and expend energy. The same was true for newborn spiders. This phenomenon greatly puzzled Fabre.</p>
<p>He also conducted an experiment, placing scorpions in a glass bottle, containing only sterile fine sand and air. After nine months, they were still alive, and the insects had even grown larger. Fabre was bewildered by this miracle at the time, and we still have not broken this mystery.</p>
<p>The mystery of human Yang Mei has been solved, but the mystery of animal Yang Mei still baffles people.</p>

<p>In 1924, a certain Neapolitan in Italy made the world's largest candle to commemorate the Italian musician Carducci. The candle weighed over three tons, was twenty feet high, and had a circumference of seven feet. Every year on All Souls' Day, this candle would be lit for twenty-four hours. Calculated, it could burn for eighteen hundred years.</p>
<p>Someone in England has invented a new method of removing smoke and dust using sound waves. An instrument creates high-frequency sound waves, causing the particles of smoke and dust to form clumps. After an hour, they fall from the air. It is said that the sound waves can be manufactured cheaply on a large scale. It is expected that in the future, every important chimney will be equipped with this new invention.</p>

<p>A doctor studied the causes of high blood pressure. His hypothesis was that it was due to listening to radio broadcasts. He tied a blood pressure monitor on his arm and turned on the radio.</p>
<p>The experimental results were:</p>
<p>(1) When listening to programs you dislike the most, blood pressure is highest, especially if you hate them, with a great risk of stroke.</p>
<p>(2) When listening to programs you like, blood pressure drops.</p>
<p>(3) General, so-so programs have little effect.</p>

<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Again I see drooping flowers on withered vines,</p>
<p>Sitting in the tower, I truly forget my sorrows,</p>
<p>Garden beans and wheat in the suburbs are neat and strict,</p>
<p>City lights twinkle with boundaries of safety and danger.</p>
<p>Deep spring, narrow land, few people walk,</p>
<p>Old teacher, tired horse, who listens?</p>
<p>Should cherish the instructions, which are heavenly intentions,</p>
<p>Record the weeds early on the stele of merit.</p>
<p>Already from white bones I have gathered yellow gold,</p>
<p>Grieved to the point of silent, sorrowful moaning,</p>
<p>Awake in the divine palace with dreams of civil and military,</p>
<p>Three years in the mortal world with a heart of chaos and separation.</p>
<p>What concern is there with the watch fires shaking morning and evening,</p>
<p>Only fear the shallow depths of the river tide,</p>
<p>Thunder rumbles, doves coo, seasons change,</p>
<p>Opening the window, I close it again on the shadows of spring.</p>
<h3 id="e128">"Spring Thunder" Review <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>The films of Yonghua Company, from "National Soul" and "Secrets of the Qing Palace" to the current "Spring Thunder," consistently tell the audience: "I am willing to spend money!" This is undoubtedly a good phenomenon when the market is flooded with crudely made national films stuck in the era of "Burning Red Lotus Temple."</p>
<p>The story of "Spring Thunder" is very sentimental and has a didactic theme, but it is not annoying. The content tells of a young, wealthy industrialist, Pan Shuming, who first meets the socialite Shen Manli, and later marries his fiancee, Li Hanfang. A child in Shen's womb is born with Li's support, to illustrate the responsibility of mothers to the second generation. The setting of Spring Thunder is used to delay the voyage, to portray Manli offering herself to Pan, and Pan drowning in Australia, all of which directly happen to Pan Shuming but affect Li Hanfang's life, which should have been smooth.</p>
<p>Li Hanfang is the most important protagonist in the film, from a charming girl, a gentle wife, to a virtuous mother, and the process is very natural. Virtuous women are not uncommon in today's society, but women with insights and willing to take responsibility, like safeguarding the posthumous child of her husband (conceived by her husband's mistress), focusing on the education of the innocent second generation (a small part of it is because of love for her husband), rather than as the world imagines, "preparing to be a ready-made old lady" (as Shen Manli said), is truly rare. In the end, when Shen sees that Pan has escaped danger and returned, she threatens to take back the child in order to force Pan to rekindle old feelings. Li's view is: Shen must ask herself whether she is worthy to be the child's mother. "A man often leaves behind a child because of a moment of pleasure, irresponsibly walks away, and even thinks that money can redeem this sin, without knowing that a mother who gives birth to a child should not only give him clothes and food, but more importantly, give him education" (paraphrased). This not only warns all the absurd men in the world, but also gives mothers a lot of inspiration. The actress Li Lihua is very serious, portraying the three eras distinctly, and her performance is pleasant and competent. Compared to her previous role in "Fake Phoenix, False Phoenix," when she was only selling "娇(娇 is untranslatable but it roughly means coquettishness)," she is in a different league.</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu's Shen Manli is very enchanting. Although influenced by the stage, some actions (such as arguing with the old man looking after the house) are inevitably exaggerated, but overall she can act even better than Li Lihua. The close-up when she pretends to be dizzy, with her eyelashes moving and the corners of her lips slightly opening, is very imaginative. The second half is not outstanding, and the screenwriter should be responsible for that. Shen Manli's personality is not consistent before and after. At the beginning, Shen fell in love with Pan at first sight, absolutely for the sake of loving Pan, not for loving Pan's money, which sets her apart from ordinary prostitutes. However, when Shen learns of Pan's death, she is not sad but intends to abort the child. Pan's wife asks her to keep the fetus, and there has to be a gentleman's agreement to "exchange half of the inheritance for the child." How did she become so unreasonable? Now that she has become so unreasonable, giving up so easily in the end seems too impossible.</p>
<p>The screenwriter is biased towards Pan Shuming. He writes about him being reserved towards Shen Manli at the beginning, and regretting it later. The screenwriter and Pan himself blame it on alcohol, but according to the narrative on the screen, Pan had not drunk alcohol when Shen moved her glass into Pan's room. Afterwards, Pan could not resist the temptation of Shen's naked body and turned around to pour himself a drink. It is acceptable to say that Pan deliberately drank alcohol to increase his courage, but it is too forgiving to say that Pan lost his composure after drinking. (Moreover, this bottle of wine is arranged too abruptly. In a hotel room late at night, Pan is not a drunkard, so where did this large bottle of strong liquor come from? Did he know in advance that Shen Manli would faint in his room?) Yan Hua's performance lacks depth, and he is not likeable.</p>
<p>The supporting roles Jiang Ming, Yu Ling, etc. have good appearances, but Jiang Ming's Mandarin is unfortunately too bad.</p>
<p>The photography is very beautiful, and the scenery of Hong Kong and Kowloon naturally accounts for a lot of the light. However, when Pan dreamed of Shen Manli during their honeymoon in the countryside, there was no explanation of the dream scene in the photography, which surprised the audience. The close-ups of several people's faces in the fashion exhibition are really redundant, except to flatter a few temporary actors.</p>
<p>The sets and costumes are extremely lavish and extravagant. However, there are too many costumes, and the two leading actresses cannot wear them all, so they also arranged a fashion exhibition, which seems a bit deliberately ostentatious.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be mentioned that the film's sound recording is clear, which is rare in national films. The theme songs sung by the two leading actresses, before and after, are also unusually beautiful. Although it is a big joke that the "socialites" in the dance hall would actually broadcast popular songs that were sung by women from good families four years ago, that is the screenwriter's business and has nothing to do with the song itself.</p>
