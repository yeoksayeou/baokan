<p>〔中央社廣州九日電〕國防部政工局長鄧文儀，於九日出席國民黨粵穗黨員聯合紀念週，分析當前戰局，全文如次：</p>
<p>由於共產黨要使戰爭進行到底，共黨對和談毫無誠意，並利用作為共黨渡江進攻准備的掩護，四月廿日，政府拒絕了共黨狂妄的八條廿四款的要求，朱毛於廿一日下令全綫總攻擊，北方的太原，南方的南京，作為其首先攻擊目標。國軍由於種種原因，主要的是匪軍實力超過當地國軍數倍，因此不能再守住太原，更不能不在南京迅速作戰略撤退。由於戰局進展到了一個新的階段，今後的戰局，將變為主客易勢，國軍把已往所背的重重的城市包袱放下之後，將可逐漸取得主動，與匪長期作戰。共匪從此背上了很多城市包袱，將不免要被動的被迫全面作戰，經過長期消耗後，匪軍終會走上日本侵略中國的覆轍。</p>
<p>共匪軍略</p>
<p>共匪鑒於日本軍閥的失敗途徑，由於軍事上沒有速戰速決。日軍在佔領南京後，沒有迅速向武漢進攻，使國民政府得到時間，將政府由南京遷到武漢，又由武漢遷到重慶，所以日軍終於失敗。共匪最近與今後的戰略，將是「速戰速決」，他們希望今年能夠結束戰爭。共匪渡江攻擊有四句口號：「突擊南京，孤立武漢，清算上海，粉碎廣州」，這是說明他的戰略要直綫同南攻擊，要在「突擊南京」之後，主力經由江·皖·贛·直指廣東·這種戰略是理想的，但是危險的。他們孤軍深入，雖然仗持着安徽·浙江·江西·廣東省土共支援，就地可以得到一些補給和內應，但華南的的人民有堅毅不屈的精神，他領教過共匪的武裝暴動，他們都有對付共產黨的經驗和教訓，也有相當的組織和力量，可以同共匪周旋，共匪決不能夠為所欲為，卽使毛澤東已訂下了欺騙的城市政策，工商政策，並且一再聲明江南土地實際要延組五年進行清算，鬥爭也要緩和一下，但平津與東北華北的匪區多是一面鏡子，一切都顯然的，非常明白，這卽是說共匪的政略配合不上他的戰略，他在華南的羣眾基礎及所謂人民路綫，甚為軟弛，這將使得共匪不專冒險長驅直入，他一遇到阻擊，就會停止下來。</p>
<p>實力比較</p>
<p>這一年來，共匪與國軍的實力互相消長。國軍所以損拴折將，喪師失地，一再挫幾，並不是由於匪軍努力強大，打敗了國軍，而是共匪使用政治攻勢與宣傳，先解除國軍的精神武裝，誘騙了青年學生同農民工人，所以在東北，在華北，不論長春·瀋陽·錦州·以至北平·張家口·天津，都沒有經過激烈戰事，林彪·聶榮臻的力量，沒有什麼損失，而華東徐州隊旗，則經過了匪連續三月以上的空前會戰，陳毅，劉伯承的主力，消耗殆盡。現在匪軍經過了四個月的整繩，同澈底總動員，雖然編足了數十個野戰軍，正規部隊，號稱兩百萬人，還有同等的軍區預備隊和民兵，現在並且有三分之二的隊伍，約四十四軍，動員渡江攻擊，這力量在數量上說是可觀的，不過就質量上說，除林彪的十個軍外，陳毅，劉伯承的隊伍，多是新聚之人編成的，其中部份為國軍的俘虜，部份係新兵，而且林彪部隊在東北脅迫參軍的東北青年，是不願在江南長期作戰的，這就是說，共匪的實力的內在甚為脆弱，當然經不起長期的嚴重的打擊。國軍的實力，總計起來，並不少於共匪，數量及質量上仍優於共匪，雖則其中有一部份是新近整編的，而且兵力稍為分散各地，好在打仗旣然要長期作戰，國軍將才幹部充足，東南，西北，西南的潛在力量仍舊可觀，士氣，人心，同經濟物資，祇要有澈底改革與動員的辦法，處處仍可取得局部優勢，至少可說共匪與國軍的實力是相等的。</p>
<p>民族自陰戰爭如何打下去</p>
<p>由於國軍的兵力尙未迅速集中，長江天險沒有好好的利用，浙贛與華南的新防綫似乎還不夠堅強，一般失敗主義者同共匪的宣傳家，因而又在散播恐怖的謠言。上海在南京撤退後的頭十天，誠然人心相當恐慌，但是經過一個星期的加強戰備工作，就安定了。上海區域的作戰時間，會相當的長，國軍在閩贛與湘鄂兩處，還各控制有數十萬強大的國軍，共匪要深入華南，來進攻廣東，他會受到左右兩翼很嚴重的威脅或打擊，廣東還有時間來加強戰備，兩廣的潛在力量發揮起來，再由外省調集若干部隊來粵增援，共匪妄想在最短期內粉碎廣州，絕不容易，甚至不可能的，爭取時間，避免決戰，堅守華南，重要戰略據點及上海嚴重打擊匪軍，是國軍最近作戰的要着，有了台灣的基地，同西北西南的支援，長期戰爭的局勢，卽可形成，戰爭一定可以打下去，總體動員全面作戰，東南西南與西北的軍民不久就都可知道共匪亡國滅種的陰謀，對於北平式的局部和平已不能再出現。國民黨與國軍應該澈底覺悟了，貪官汚吏與政客們，會趕快逃跑了，祇有澈底實行總體戰，總動員方可集中力量。抗戰時「有錢出錢，有力出力」的口號，現在應改為「破產保產拼命保命。」凡是要自由要生存，要生活下去的人都應起來參加這長期的全面戰爭，步步為營，人自為戰，不這樣是不行的。二十年前廣東的革命精神，應該發揚起來，共產匪黨軍隊到了廣東就要被消滅，共匪猖狂態勢，發展已到頂點，過此就要下降了。</p>
<p>全中國而尤其是全廣東的軍民，應該開始行動，為反共救國，自由生存而作戰敵人沒有什麼可怕，用不着悲觀消極，應該使人人站起來，堅強團結嚴密組織與共匪作戰到底，相信經過長期戰鬥，以後共匪一定失敗國軍一定勝利。</p>

<p>〔本報福州九日電〕贛浙閩交界處之玉山鉛山先後告警，閩邊已接近前綫，雖武夷天險，然土共滋擾堪慮，省當局為防患未然，決加強措施，以應時需，聞已初步決定以縣為基礎，決定應變注意兩項數事。政治方面，提高事員縣長職權，加強力量，確保治安，必要時得分別裁減非必要機關及事業。經濟方面，稅收得改征銀元或實物，整理糧政，催繳短欠田賦，必要時得辦理獻糧，以充軍食，辦理自衛特捐，以裕應變費用。軍事方面，積極協助征兵之推行，並號召地方有聲望能力人士，領導民眾組織自衛武力，協助政府，保衛家鄉。社會方面，切實注意地方秩序之穩定，並妥予救濟全境難民，協助軍事機關，辦理傷病官兵之救護安插。</p>
<p>〔本報福州九日電〕閩北大軍雲集，朱紹良九日在省府會報席上宣稱：閩北安謐無事，省境電話均暢通，僅光澤縣長棄職潛逃，決予緝辦，眾所關切之糧食問題，亦不足憂，以鹽換得贛米廿萬擔，卽可運省，又聯勤滬裝給處在贛東存米九千萬包，亦正洽請撥運閩境，另省府在港已採購大量麵粉，中央在暹購米，閩省配額三萬噸，亦將源源運來。又，省田糧處長陳拱北，定十日偕儲運科長何杰赴台，洽商以閩土產，木材，香菇交換軍糧十萬包事，故閩省糧食供應前途殊可樂觀。又，閩省保安副司令兼榕警局長施覺民，定十日赴台公幹。</p>

<p>〔中央社廣州九日電〕此間中央日報今以「廣東需要一個嶄新的局面」為題，撰論稱：政府業已南遷廣州，則廣東對於中國未來歷史所賦予使命之重大，非過去時期所可比擬。今日廣東雖成為實際之行都，但條件尙嫌不足，因此該報認為此時此地之廣東，應增強防務及穩定經濟。該報首先指出，政府所在地之首都，須防務堅強，就目前廣東情形而論，境內土共蠢動，社會不安，日前立委蕭錚等建議粵省增編九個軍，若此點不易成功，則可儘先組訓民間實力雄厚，堪資利用。其次，目前廣東經濟情形混亂，政府對改革幣制尙在計劃階段，而公用與交通事業均收銀元，金圓券已失通貨價值，黃金外幣興波作浪，政府無法阻止，人民因分心經濟，已精疲力盡，對戡亂措施不免　覺冷淡。該報最後謂，剿匪軍事已至短兵相　地步，故廣東安　實乃整個自由中國之安危，故要求中央迅速增強軍事，穩定經濟，使廣東為復興中國之燈塔。</p>

<h3 id="c10">立院院務檢討會　童院長報告在京復會原因與經過　希望組調查會澈底調查 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州九日電〕立院九日下午三時舉行院務檢討會，出席委員二零八人，徐源泉主席，首由童院長報告在京復會經過及疏散情形，維由秘書長陳克文報告事務及財務情形，及南京撤退時經過，委員彭醇士·潘于英·彭鎭寰·陳紫楓·盧宗濂等相繼發言，對院務有所詢問，最後由童院長答覆，並希望在十日院會席上正式提議組織一調查委會，推選若干委員澈底調查，以明真相，如果渠本人確有不法情事，自當依法處理，渠盼立院同人勿意氣用事，免傷和氣。至六時許宣告散會。</p>
<p>童院長於報告關於南京復會問題時稱，部份同人對於這事不大了解，過去因為有許多問題，沒有機會向各位說明。本年二月初，政府從南京撤退後，南京虛空，幾乎成為無政府狀態，那種情形，今天在座委員有許多看見的，嗣經幾位首長研究後，囑本人同于院長於二月八日飛廣州，先請重要首長返京，把南京政府精神力量支持起來，然後從事於安定軍心民心，作一個准備，這種情形，對於外面不好發表，所以事前同于院長商定，卽是看看這裏籌備的情形，當時最重要的，是請孫院長吳副院長返京，對於整個局面，作個詳細籌劃。本人在穗時，報上登載，謂本人已答應在廣州復會，這是不確的。</p>
<p>二月十二日，本人同于院長飛上海，我報告了此地的情形以後，有一位同仁說「院長，你認為在南京復會好，抑廣州復會好」？我的答復是為聽從多數人的意見，大家說要在廣州，廣州已有准備，若要在南京，就馬上准備。十三日晚車本人回南京，向李代總統報告。十六日赴上海，出席談話會，到場委員有百多人，當時發言的人很多，很熱烈以後，一致決定在南京復會，日期由院長決定。本人十三日回南京時，有各地來的許多電報和信，這些電報和信，有主張在南京復會的，有主張在廣州復會的，統計結果，主張在南京復會的三百個人，在廣州復會的一百多人。出席上海談話會後回到南京，在同京仁堅決主張在京復會，並要本人十七日發表，我說必須先把經費問題解決，後來同徐部長交涉經費，徐部長答應先借，依照憲法規定，二個月內復會，二月只有二十八天，計算各方面來京途程至少一週，所以決定二十日開始報到，這是在南京復會的原因和經過。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕海軍戡亂殉難官兵永興軍艦艦長陸維源上校等官兵三百餘人追悼大會，昨（九）日上午九時假本市威海衛路新生活俱樂部隆重舉行。到桂永清，湯恩伯（陳大慶代），方治，陳良（沈傳禮代）萬武罄，徐鳴亞，曁海總各單位首長，各艦艇官兵，各界代表八百餘人，由桂永清總司令主祭，周憲章，董沐曾，馬德驥，馬紀壯，王天池，劉慶生，陶滌亞等陪祭。禮堂遍佈花圈輓聯，莊嚴肅穆。蔣總統頒題「氣壯河山」，何應欽輓為「民族精英」，湯恩伯輓曰：「合力挽狂瀾，戰伐艱難　績；招魂向極浦，江流嗚咽有哀聲」。桂永清輓：「為存國脈，爭自由而捐，寰宇仰忠貞，精神不朽；誓乘長風，遇赤燄以繼遺志，海洋仍壯闊，大業常新」。祭禮依次進行，歷時四十分鐘，空氣始終悲壯嚴肅。</p>
<p>會後，桂總司令復集合到會海軍各級官長士兵，作簡短訓話。桂將軍首先以沉痛心情，向殉難官兵致意，對列難官兵眷屬未能一一親自訪問慰勞，表示無限遺憾。繼稱：「經過三百多我們海軍官兵英勇壯烈犧牲，證明了中國海軍百分之九十都有志氣，都有血性，有理想，尤有認識，我們海軍官兵弟兄，都是忠勇無比的戰士，過去，大家對海軍大忽視了」；桂永清將軍說到永與艦院長陸維源等官兵英勇壯烈殉職的事蹟，各到會官兵莫不同聲感動流淚。「經過了這些英烈的鮮血的考驗教訓，同時證明了中國海軍的戰鬥情緒比世界上任何國家的海軍歷史更壯烈無比，所以，我們中國海軍走的戰鬥道路，更為艱難壯烈英勇得多」。桂將軍說：「只有不嗜殺人者，才能統一中國」。他說：「面對着我償的敵人——出賣民族國家的共產黨，我們海軍官兵要記取這些血的教訓，更加英勇的戰鬥」。「今天是我們革命最艱苦的時候，尤其是海軍，我們要進一步的認識這種最艱苦的時候，便是我們最光明的時候，最光榮的時候，我們要更加有志氣，有勇氣，有決心，更加英勇的奮鬥，繼續長江八百五十海哩的戰鬥精神，造成海軍上活動更堅強的力量，消滅敵人」。</p>

<p>〔合眾社東京九日電〕此間可靠的英國人仕，確認中共將進攻香港，若干駐日美國官員則懷疑大西洋公約的批准，是否必須使美國參與防衛英國的殖民地。某消息靈通的英國人仕九日稱，香港是否將被攻擊，已不是問題，問題則在何時被攻擊而已。中共早已再三要求從中國境內取消一切我國的影響，中共軍隊曾在長江中砲擊英艦，中立觀察家稱：中共顯然並不恐懼英國，渠等於為中共必將因香港而與英國衝突，至少在外交上。</p>
<p>同時，如果一旦中共進攻香港，大西洋公約國家是否在北大西洋區域以外相互協助的問題，將隨之而起，此間若干美國軍事官員認為英國與中共如一旦在香港實際衝突，則將形成第三次大戰的潛在導火綫，因此係東西集團間的衝突，若干人仕認為：如果大西洋公約不以地區為限，駐日美軍可能馳往香港，協助防衛，但此點必須待華盛頓最高司令部的命令。</p>

<p>〔本報專訪〕最近記者有親戚徐君方自共區脫險來滬，記者特往走訪，徐君向在蕪湖經商，此次於上月廿三日當蕪湖易手之頃，始離蕪東返，歷經京·鎮·常·錫諸地，餐風飲露，備嘗艱辛，閱十餘日方抵上海。上述諸地自易手以後，與上海音訊阻隔，而海上人士籍隸京滬沿綫者當不在少數，對家鄉近況定甚關切，爰將晤談所得，歸撰成稿，以饗本報讀者。</p>
<p>蕪湖撤退</p>
<p>蕪湖原係二十軍楊幹才部防地，上月廿一日晚，楊部接獲行將撤退消息，廿二日軍人眷屬卽先成行，是晚楊部亦接奉正式命令撤退，蕪湖百姓聆訊後頓起恐慌，扶老携幼，相率逃難。徐君亦於七三日晨隨擁擠之人潮趕往江南鐵路火車站，設法購得車票，攀登車頂，八時許火車東開，下午三時到達南京中華門，恰值國軍撤退，共軍未來之真空時期，南京情況甚顯混亂，搶劫事件層出不窮，所有商店全部打烊，大櫥窗多碎成粉末，甚至攤販亦難得一見，街道上卻塞滿了各色人等，是日共軍尙未進城，但已滿街貼上五光十色之標語。徐君幸遇一嵇姓老叟，乃借宿其家，蓋其時已無法覓得旅館。兩日後復由老叟介紹至下關某過房媛家住宿，俾使候車東返，下關新建軍站大廈已全部被毀，幾乎夷為平地，聞火車雖已恢復行駛，但係軍用，不准人民搭乘。</p>
<p>京常道上</p>
<p>徐君留京數日，在下關，和平門兩處來回數次，均無上車機會，正惆悵愁煩之際，在和平門遇一許姓友人，亦擬來滬，乃約為旅伴，直至五月一日清晨，方以每人一元大頭代價，搭卡車至鎮江，宛如昔日在內地公路上行進然，令人感慨萬端。下午四時許到鎮後，略進稀飯，卽趕往火車站，徐君等向共軍哨兵再三懇請，直至夜間十二時，方准進入月台，見有升火待發之車頭，詢明知係前往丹陽者，卽攀登車頭，約經一小時許，共軍開到，陸續上車，旋即東行，至天亮車抵陵口停駛，徐君等一宿未睡，復枵腹步行至奔牛，時已下午一時，方進餐，並設法覓車，卒以每人八毛銀元代價，搭車至常州，卽借旅館留宿。鎮江·常州商店已有開業者，惟顧客殊寥落。</p>
<p>蘇錫市容</p>
<p>翌晨卽覓搭小火輪至無錫，每人索費大頭一元半，約中午至達，未進餐，卽轉船至蘇州，到時約為下午四時行，蘇錫表面上仍頗熱鬧。一路上金圓券已不能通用，除銀元·人民券·華中券外·鎳幣·鉛元亦成一般通用之輔幣，一般生活費用殊為高昂，米價如鎮江，蘇州，每擔均售大頭八元之譜。</p>
<p>在蘇留宿一夜，次晨卽搭帆船輾轉間道到陸家浜，費時約一日半，安抵陸家浜，旋即轉搭京滬車來滬。</p>

<p>〔路透社新加坡八日電〕中國政府官員數人，卽將飛往曼谷，協助中國航空馬球與暹政府進行談判，俾使該公司飛機得在曼谷降陸，以擴展其南洋航綫至新加坡。據此間中航公司人員稱，中國政府希望該項談判迅速完成，與中國國內局勢無關，亦並非准備將撤退人員由中航機載往新加坡，中航飛機雖可自香港直飛新加坡，但若干中途無降陸站，無甚利益可圖，故必須與暹政府協商降陸權。</p>
<h3 id="c25">社論　現階段的物價問題 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>自從限價堤防總崩潰後，金圓券便走上了法幣末期的舊路，最初物價上漲的幅度，還很輕微，波動的期限，也還是週期性的；可是時至今日，因為客觀情勢的劇遽轉變，以及信用膨脹的過度激烈，所以物價天天都在變動，尤其是廣州的物價，一日數漲，最堪驚人。</p>
<p>試以上週中廣州物價為例，星期五港幣開盤一百萬元，收九十萬元；黃金以港幣計算，每條四百零五元，美鈔五百六十萬元，大頭六百五十萬元。但至星期六，漲風驟起，港幣漲至二百十萬元，美鈔一千三百萬元，大頭一千四百萬元。一夕之隔，變化竟至如此鉅大，真令人不敢置信，或有恍同隔世之感。德·俄·匈·的馬克，盧布，彭古時代，恐怕亦不過如此。故目前不但一般升斗小民，無以應付生活的，即是主管財政金融的大員們，亦莫不覺到束手無策，長此以往，國計民生，將何以堪！</p>
<p>關於最近物價的猛跳，表面雖在於人心浮動，市場混亂，但實則導因於金圓券的惡性膨脹，及生產機能的萎縮，本來天下事都是積之漸久，發之愈驟，決沒有「憑天而降」的那種奇遇，何況當前錯綜萬端的物價，更不會那樣的單純。尤其今日的通貨與物價，互相推動，互相循環，原是一而二，二而一的東西，欲求全面經濟的穩定，必須雙管齊下，一面控制發行，一面管制物價與增加生產，才能見效。劉財長在穗發表談話稱，日來物價上漲，乃因各地發行地方券，排斥金圓券所致。實在是似是而非的論斷。</p>
<p>目前金圓券的發行數字，雖然主持發行的機構，諱莫如深，但由於龐大軍政費的予取予求，故我們可斷言已超駕昔日的法幣發行額之上，加之使用的區域，日益縮小，故金圓券充斥市場，而發生了自然貶值的現象。同時京·鎮·常·錫·蘇·等地相繼棄守後，大局急變購物資或金鈔，保存購買力，由於大家競相拋棄金圓券的關係，而使得物價更貴，幣值更跌。況且政府一向認為穩定幣值的法寶「法寶」——拋與抽的政策，自從金，銀南運後，根本無法施展；從而，怎怪幣值不慘跌？物價不騰漲？</p>
<p>根據價格的原理，一方面通貨增加，一方面須求物資的增加，物價才能保持平衡。但在目前交通寸斷，運輸麻痺的狀態下，原物料的採購，動力，燃料的供應等，就大有問題，如向國外採辦，則匯價奇昂，增加成本的負擔，必使產品的價格，在成本之下，廠商焉能維持？此外，最近因為時局動盪，銀行家多顧慮放款與投資的安全，產業資金的籌措，益形困難，因之廠商營運資金的調度，就無法圓滑進行。還有近年來華北斷流，加之一般購買力又異常薄弱，實銷不暢，阻碍了產品的出路，即使產品勉強以低價脫手，但補進原料深為不易，他方面由於捐稅繁重，工資浩大，種種困難因素，使產業家裹足不前，極度感覺心灰意懶，發生了消彬的觀念，故而停工減產的現象，觸目皆是。然則此時產業雖然停頓，正當商業雖然蕭條，但投機囤積，異常猖獗，人民都厚了「不勞而獲」的僥倖心理，試問此種混濁的釁圍中，如何能求生產的效能，與物資的增加？反之，供求失去平衡，使物價更形昂貴。當前面臨着這樣的險境，當局如不從增加物資根本處着手，何以能抑平物價？</p>
<p>無可諱言的，當前的物價洪流，已摧毀了經濟的結構，瞻望物價前途，更為黯淡，這種情形，異常嚴重。以物價為中心，而經濟的安定與否，亦以物價為轉移，穩定物價，先決問題，亦唯有從停止膨脹通貨政策，減緩通貨流通速率，及強化生產機構着手不可，否則，一切都是空談。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕美國官方鐵幕後獲悉，蘇聯之「莫洛托夫計劃」，意欲促進其各附庸國之生產，似已失半後外。鐵幕後之羅捷保與波蘭曾於今年初組織「經濟互助委員會」，担保年內提高生產，其計劃在利用全區之生產以謀全區之福利。但各國實際依舊各自為政，並不互助。</p>
<p>例如捷克曾拆除紡織機器，匈牙利則添設新紡織廠。莫洛托夫曾允許各附庸國投資約三十億元於工業，但若干國家正創辦同樣之企業，不怕將來生產過剩。多瑙河歸蘇聯獨佔後，航業一落千丈，僅及該河開放時十分之一。沿河各國對於航運管制，亦各自為政。莫斯科之最大困難似在南斯拉夫，狄托總理與克林姆宮之政治責備。南共機關報「波爾巴報」稱，莫斯科電台所謂一九四四年蘇聯以小麥五十萬噸接濟南國之說實為謊言，實際僅有五萬噸，蘇聯要求南國以鋁砂三百七十噸交換蘇聯牽引綫一部，價目大不公道。蘇聯且要求莫斯科之南斯拉夫留學生以美元付費，使南國之外匯更見枯竭。莫斯科似已停止以工業機器運往南國，並已自南國撤回蘇聯技師，此舉使狄托最為惱怒。狄托某次演說中指莫斯科存心壓制南國之工業化，南斯拉夫不甘繼續居於原料供應者之地位。羅馬尼亞方面情勢亦未見樂觀。羅全國工業由八個羅國聯合委員會管制，蘇聯曾向羅國訂購大批重工業機器，但羅國共產政府已有不滿之表示。同時蘇聯政策觀察家已發現史達林久已欲利用蘇聯各鄰邦，史氏於一九二〇年曾有「蘇聯政策與國家問題」一書，內稱「世界革命爐灶之蘇聯中部，倘無原料燃料與糧食豐富的各鄰邦援助，不能長期支持」。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦八日電〕綱球大王克拉姆今日宣布，下海以來一帆風順，尙可在職業綱球界橫行三年以上，保持常勝軍威名。克拉姆現在倫敦表演，他說：「將來倘有人崛起，能常常擊敗我，那麼我要完全退出比賽。」克拉姆現年不過廿八歲，公認為當世最優秀的綱球家。一九四七年連獲三項轉入職業界，享受每年十萬美元的薪水。克拉姆論及綱球家的黃金時代，他說：「綱球家倘能好好保養，勇猛稍進，可以保持風頭到三十二歲。但這是很費力的。我必須限制喝啤酒，且禁喝威士忌。」</p>
<p>克拉姆三月間率隊來歐表演，隊員包括美國的李格斯，澳洲的貝爾斯，赤道國的塞古拉。克拉姆平常的表演對手是李格斯，自一九四七年十二月以來，兩人的比賽，十次中有八九次是克拉姆勝的。所以克拉姆希望今年業餘綱球界有生手加入職業界。克氏認為今年業餘綱球家中有染指三大綱球錦標（卽溫勃爾頓錦標，全美錦標與台杯錦標）希望的，是美國的許洛達與貢柴爾及澳洲的勃朗維區。許洛達是克拉姆的老搭檔，兩人在一九四六年與一九四七年兩度合作奪得台杯。貢柴爾是二十歲的小將，曾奪得美國草地硬地與戶內三大綱球錦標。勃朗維區頻年倒霉，但克拉姆說：「他今年來美後，事事順利，或者可以交運。」其次有希望的三人是一九四八年溫勃爾頓冠軍美國范登堡，洛山磯老將派克和捷克左手大將屈羅尼。克拉姆批評屈氏說：「屈羅尼不愧大將之才，可惜長力不濟，不能在一禮拜中作三次大戰，在溫勃爾頓比賽中必須有這種遭遇。」</p>
<p>上述的六人中任何一人只要在今後六個月在業餘綱球界奪得魁首，就在現成的發財機會等着他。克拉姆說：「我不難拖地下海，我只要給他看我的存款簿，下海第一年我賺進了十一萬五千元。」</p>

<p>今日甲組綢白對壘中行</p>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽，前日乙三部突錰爆出一幕冷門，種子隊新星竟不敵育才，而以一對四之懸殊比數，慘遭毒手，令人驚異。育才小將初未嘗抱勝利希望，焉知頭陣卽由莊廷舫於意外取得勝利，其餘小將精神為之一振，新星因健將高尙志之失利，打擊不少，二三兩組亦可勝不勝可遭遇危運，殊屬不幸，全隊僅由主將汪秀光奪回一城，結果育才以四對一大勝新星，可謂得意傑作。據聯賽幹事陳霖笙君談：乙組一部種子凌隊已為紅白隊所挫，二部種子招商則能遭帆聲之毒手，此戰又目睹育才小將壓倒三部種子新星，可謂後浪推前浪，誠為本屆聯賽豐富之收穫，值得興奮，惟切盼勝者勿驕，敗者勿餒，加強研究技術上之缺點，提高水凖，以期成為一員出類拔萃之優秀人才，茲揮錄雙方戰績及前賽各場結果如下：</p>

<p>緊急儲糧之撥交，係根據美經臺分署於本月一日召集各有關機關會商之決議，當時所決定之主要原則如下：（一）美經合分署及糧儲會同意，在不影響戶口配米原則之下，由糧儲會即日撥發食米二千公噸，專作各公用事業公司職工及直係眷屬應付緊急之用。（二）·上項公用事業公司職工及直系眷屬緊急儲備米之數額，以每人三十市斤（兩市斗），每一職工連同其直系眷屬以四人計算為標準。（三）上項米糧運轉公司所在地後，應由公司負責妥為保管，非俟戶口米停配時不得動用。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽廿九日航訊〕筑市百業最近均已逐漸走上用銀元作基數的道路。各電影院於本週一（廿五）將樓座每粟金圓券五千元，改為銀元一角五分，池座三千五百元改為一角，按當日銀元價格折合金圓券收費。過去五千元一張票，突然變為五萬餘元，甚至七萬餘元。在以俸給生活者為主要觀衆的電影娛樂場所，其營業情形當然是門可羅雀。其中如羣新電影院，昨日下午四時復遇一哭笑不得賠錢禮的趣事，該院第二場放映時間已經過了一刻多鐘，僅售出樓座三張，池座四張，且均為軍人·學生。如果為此七人放映一場，則影院賠本太大，只好婉言勸請改在下場入座，但此七人堅不願意改票，非立即遵守時間放映不可。該院執事好好歹歹的表示願意退票，甚至承認加倍退票，此七人亦堅不答應。最後始由該院交際經理出面致歉，說明困難，並邀赴附近餐館大吃一頓，各自加倍退票，續把這場因改收銀元超過人民負担所遭致的鬧劇和平結束。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕最近的貴陽報紙，發行和廣告的定價之高，寰顧國內各大城市，恐怕要首屈一指了，四月二十日以前，對開日報每份定價金圓一千六百元，四開晚報八百元，廣告每寸定價也不過一千六百元。二十日各日晚報均遵照報聯會公議，改以銀元作基數，對開日報每份定價銀元一角，四開晚報五分，廣告每寸三角，以出版前一日午後九時之銀元價格為標準，折合金圓券收費。十九日的報紙價錢，不過一千六百元，第二天便突然一跳為八千五百元，從此銀元價錢天天上漲，報紙價錢也就天天上漲，最高曾達三萬九千元一份。偏偏貴陽市的報販子又有陋規，批價照定價六七折不等，他們零售的時候又照定價加一二成不等，換句話說，貴陽人在前兩天銀元價錢最高達到四十九萬的時候，要花六萬元金圓券才能買一份日報看看，在一個工商經濟並不發達的邊地小城市，如何不令人咋舌！旬日以來，各家日晚報已大感「改元」的痛苦，訂戶紛紛退報，零售一天比一天減少，廣告除結婚訂婚花錢作樂的而外，簡直無新戶上門。各家負責人碼頭時總是唉聲嘆氣，認為自食惡果。</p>
<p>中央日報·貴州日報·貴州商報三家日報，最近已在打算用「減輕讀者負擔」的名義，自動減低發行定價的銀元基數，並準備把廣告刊例大放折扣來度過難關。小春秋·新世界·明道報三家晚報花頭更妙，從五月一日起，改為輪流出版辦法，即是在做「做一天吃三天」的買賣，由每日出版變為三日刊，藉此可以節省許多開支，每天由一家晚報來做賣「獨門子」的生意，各家還可以裁掉許多職員。青年新聞晚報率性停刊兩天，站在「黃鶴樓上」看別人去　驗渡江的結果如何，再作決定。他們認為不改銀元不得了，改了銀元還是不得了，最後一條路，恐怕只有關門。</p>
<h3 id="c83">第三次世界大戰　是「政治細菌戰」 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 曾虛白</p>
<p>第三次世界大戰會不會發生？若會發生，何時發生？如何發生？這是當前人人關心的問題，中外論者已發表了許多高論，我願再來補充一些尚未經人注意到的意見。</p>
<p>我們要論世界大戰，先得給戰爭這名辭確立個定義。一般來說，兵戎相見，才是戰爭；可是近代的政治鬥爭，可以兵不血刃而獲得戰爭的效果。倘然戰爭的定義祗限於前者，我敢說，以蘇聯為主動的世界大戰，不獨十年五十年不會發生，並且是永遠不會發生的；倘然戰爭的定義擴大而知後者，則第三次大戰早已開始第二次大戰結束前，現在正在積極擴展中。</p>
<p>我說，以蘇聯為主動的世界大戰，有人或要問，難道未來的世界大戰，一定是由蘇聯主動的嗎？我說，這是必然的，因為以目前社會主義與資本主義的對峙態勢來判斷，資本主義國家顯然是取手勢的，目的在確守既得利益，保持其社會秩序的現狀，而社會主義國家則以達成世界社會主義革命為其任務，取的是攻勢，當然是發動戰爭的主動者。假定我們能斷定這主動的國家不會採取戰爭的形式來進攻，我們就可推論而斷定，社會主義革命性的未來戰爭，是永遠不會兵戎相見的。</p>
<p>凡是明瞭或親身體騐過共產黨徒政治手腕的人，都知道共產黨是以組織羣衆，把握羣衆，運用羣衆來做他們鬥爭的資本，他們永遠是幕後的導演者，決不親自袍笏登場的。他們的拿手好戲是分散幹部到羣衆中間去，組織細胞，然後再運用許多細胞的力量，拆散社會固有的組織，重建他們理想的新組織。他們有村幹鄉幹來導演村民大會鄉民大會舞臺上的演出，他們有農幹工幹來操縱農工團體會場中的決議。他們排除或懲罰現政權以及地主和資本家，決不暴露他們所取得的政權來作硬性的壓迫，而以民主方式的羣衆大會來清算鬥爭。這一套把戲，我們中國民衆，時至今日，已耳熟能詳了。</p>
<p>然而這一套政治運用的手腕，並不是中共獨得之秘，而是共產主義教條下爭奪政權固定的公式。在中共佔領區內的每一村鎮裏，我們看到這一公式的普遍應用，在共產黨鐵幕後面的國家如捷克，波蘭，匈牙利，保加利亞，羅馬尼亞等，沒有一個地方不是運用這個方式來奪取政權的。雖然因地制宜，技巧的運用，因環境的不同，各國容有一些差別，可是基本方式是「天不變，道亦不變」的。</p>
<p>這一種滲入戰術是政治性的細菌戰。在共產黨的看法，其威力之大，遠勝於飛機大砲。他們以為這種戰術可使原子彈失掉它毀滅的對象，因為他們所散布的細菌是深入到每一國家社會組織的細胞裏，誰又能分得清那一個細胞包含着這種毒菌。就算分清了，千千萬萬顆細胞，混在一起，又那裏找得到毀滅的對象。</p>
<p>這戰術根本就是一個政治性的原子彈。因為原子彈的作用是打碎物質的細胞的組織，而這戰術是打碎政治的細胞的組組。共產主義者都是這樣想法。</p>
<p>因此，他們決不靠自知趕不上人家的飛機大砲以及原子彈來擴展他們的政治領域，而要儘量運用他們自信有十分把握的政治性原子彈，來達成他們的社會革命的。換言之，他們絕不願以兵戎相見的戰爭，來與資本主義國家週旋，因此我說這種性質的戰爭是永遠不會發生的。</p>
<p>或說，第二次世界大戰，蘇聯豈不是參戰國之一，並且是犧牲最重大的參戰國之一嗎？他們可以參加一次戰爭，安見沒有發動另一次戰爭的可能呢？這考慮的確有意義的，因為可以更進一步推論蘇聯當前備戰的動機。</p>
<p>我們研究第二次世界大戰的經過時，看着蘇聯參加同盟國陣營是怎樣的朝三暮四躊躇滿志，以及戰爭結果暴露出它因種種戰爭條件的不完備而所受犧牲又怎樣慘重，我們就可以明瞭蘇聯是打不來硬仗的，它的共產黨主政者也知道它是肩不起打仗的重任的。它的參戰是不得已而為之，它若不挺身而出，納粹的鐵路將踏毀第三國際發號施令的將台，社會革命的基礎將根本剷除。它不得不利用資本主義國家的懵懂，加入它們的陣營，以保全它既得的政治資本。它是被迫而打硬仗，打了硬仗必受慘重的犧牲，共產黨明知而無法避免，是他們不可明言的悲劇。</p>
<p>今日蘇聯戰爭條件的不備，更甚於第二次參戰以前，這一點已經英·美記者不斷的揭發，不必我再加闡述。我祗願在這裏揭出若干英美記者最後結論的錯誤：他們以為，蘇聯現正埋頭軍備的擴充，期於規定計劃完成之後，超越資本國家的軍事實力，再與美英在戰場上一決雌雄。他們沒有知道蘇聯的備戰，就軍事方面說，完全是防禦性的，實際它的進攻，早已開始，在資本主義國家自欺欺人的妥協期待中，它已衝過了不知道幾道防綫而升堂入室，滲入到資本主義國家的心臟裏去了。</p>
<p>就現狀來推斷未來，我們不難想像此後共產勢力擴展的輪廓。病菌的侵襲。必先以抵抗力薄弱的身體為進攻的對象。共產主義者更把握了資本主義國家的弱點，就是那體質健碩的國家羣，實際也靠着這一大羣體弱羣衆的支持，才能維持它們的健康，倘然共產主義者能解體這弱者羣，健碩者羣，失掉了支持，也就變了弱者，而成了病菌易攻的對象。先弱者而後強者一一解體，社會主義革命的任務就功德圓滿了。觀於近東風雲的變幻，遠東共產勢力的膨脹，我們敢說這種推斷是正確的。資本主義的堡壘是美與英。假定大英帝國的殖民地與自治領，先後受毒菌的侵蝕而崩潰，英倫三島恐難為僅存的碩果。假定，南美諸邦盡成赤化，遠東市場罩上了鐵幕，美國也難成其為金元王國了。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以推定，此後不會有像第一次第二次世界大戰那樣的國際大戰爭。若干國家將像中國那樣的發生內戰，若干國家將掀起不斷的政潮。表面上是每一個國家內部左右派別的鬥爭，而實際上每一國家的所謂左，是有統一性的，有幕後指揮的一個軍事政治大集團，而所謂右，却是無組織，無目的一盤散沙。</p>
<p>假定我們這種推斷是正確的，再看看資本主義國家最近的措施：假如大西洋安全公約的締結等，在軍事上作積極的防禦，深恐克里姆林宮的領袖正在掩口葫蘆，笑不可仰。他會笑這些爬在警戒綫上布置哨兵的政治家，有一天夢醒來，會發現自己的老巢已換了主人的。</p>
<p>共產主義者的政治細菌戰所造成的病症，是細胞解體的內症，而資本主義國家想醫這個病，却採用了操刀以割的外科手術，這真是病急亂投醫的牛頭不對馬嘴了。</p>
<p>内症應用醫内症的藥。病菌要打碎你的細胞，你就應健全你的細胞；病菌要利用你的體弱，你就應扶植你的本原。世界本是一個息息相通的經濟體系，國與國間，民族與民族間，實有生死與共，禍福相倚的關聯。因此，更應警戒，弱者的解體，就是強者的喪鐘。扶助全世界易受病菌侵襲的弱者，一個強健起來，是得天獨厚的強國，保證自己將來不受病菌侵襲的惟一正確的鬥爭政策，目前積極作戰爭準備的一切人力物力，應轉移向這方面去。</p>
<h3 id="c84">新疆馬庫　焉耆名馬　是「無言戰士」 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— 李松責</p>
<p>〔迪化二日航訊〕「苜蓿隨天馬」，其實焉耆馬在古西域與天馬也是相伯仲的。焉耆維族人呌着「黑城」，可是這「黑城」的「無言戰士」（新疆省警備司令陶峙岳將軍語），還是遊牧民族蒙古人所篆養着的。</p>
<p>本來在新疆如伊犁，塔城，鎮西和焉耆等地，都是產馬區，如果以體尺，體型，持久力，及粗飼性條件來比較，還是伊犁與焉耆兩地所產的馬為最好。而今伊犁還是「特殊區域」，焉耆便成為新疆今日唯一的馬庫了。</p>
<p>焉耆馬並非焉耆所獨產，在焉耆行政區所包括的焉耆·和碩·和靖·輪台·尉犁·婼羌·且末和庫爾勒等八縣，均都產馬，不過以焉耆·和碩·和靖三縣所產的馬為最好。在清水河以東，開都河以南，以達博斯騰湖的為和碩，本地人稱為「和碩馬」或「和碩家」，調轉過來以至天山里的為「和靖」，本地人稱為「和靖馬」或「大山馬」。焉耆縣在地形上恰恰夾在中間，無形被瓜分了，因而焉耆人也就不呌「焉耆馬」了。</p>
<p>焉耆馬既是焉耆·和碩·和靖三縣的總稱，當然牠分佈的地區，也就在這三縣中不同角落的　豐美的草原上。其在平原的為曲惠，清水河，他鳥加河，鳥什他拉，鳥拉察汗以及開都河的下游，和博斯騰湖的近濱，其在天山里的為哈倫溝，阿拉溝，巴侖台，東塔什干，納入日樂，沙哈特克，曹汗汗查，開里固特，牛池更塔什汗，及大小尤魯獨斯等地。天山里在冬季氣候非常寒冷，草也枯黃了，夏季則綠草如茵，清涼異常。在平原灘，夏季很熱，而且蚊虫很多，但在冬季却很溫暖，水草可供遊牧。所以遊牧的人們有「夏窩」與「冬窩」的區別。</p>
<p>如果我們以今之「伯樂」自命，從科學上來加以鑬別的話，和碩馬較和靖馬為遜色，在和靖馬中大山馬又較山外馬為遜色，至於比普通所說的焉青馬，則更要遜色得多。</p>
<p>一般的焉耆馬，它的體型各部份都是對稱的：頭方形：耳朶短，鼻孔大，嘴唇薄，頭長適度，腰背廣長，尻尾緩斜，胸膝廣闊，繫締較多，熊蹄臥蹄極少，　姿態很駿秀雜色也極少，其中如黃，黑，黑粟，紅粟，紅棗等色為最多，而且毛的長短薄厚也很適度，平均體高在一百三十六公分以上，牠的步樣多屬於「側對肢」而「交義肢」與「密里細」和起來也僅佔全馬數中的二分之一，它的稟賦是「血液質」多于「水腺質」，神經質「少到百分之三」，性情溫馴，行動敏捷，至於持久力，攀登力，以及粗詞性與耐寒暴性，更是別的地方的馬所望塵莫及的。</p>
<p>在焉耆區和靖的馬羣中，尤其大山馬，一般素質又較出產在和頭的馬幾乎耍優良一倍，最顯著的差別是和頭馬毛色不純，被毛粗厚而　長，體長方面，略低二三公分，然而壽命長，善攀登，以及關節與蹄壁的堅固却又是和頭馬所獨具的特點。</p>
<p>這些馬羣的所有權，十之八九是握在蒙古人的手裏。在蒙古人可以說馬匹是代替了他和她們的腿腳，蒙古人的財產，馬羣是被計算的主要部份，因此也可以說，馬匹是蒙古人的生命綫。我們回想成吉思汗之所以能叱咤歐亞不可一世，打算實現所謂的「吾將令現在處於帳幕之人，高出於世界各民族之上」的豪語，也是靠了馬匹。因此照傳統上講，照道理上講，蒙古同胞對於馬匹，應該是如何的珍護，如何的改進。可是事實上呢？焉耆馬不僅在數量上是一天天的減少，在民國二十八年間，　　蘇聯在焉耆高價選購了聽說有三萬多匹。馬仲英退出新疆時，又在焉耆區搶走了四千餘匹，在伊犁事變後，又被伊方扣去牧在天山里的約有兩萬餘匹。至於當地軍民積年累月所採購的焉耆馬，更是不可以數計，目前綜合估計不過兩萬多匹，在全疆九十萬匹的數字上，已是很小的比例。況且每年所生產的數目，不能祗償每年的消耗數目，再過上二三十年以後，縱然不至於絕跡，而所謂焉耆名馬也恐怕徒有其名了。這是單從數量上看的，再就本質上，蒙古人並不能發揚其傳統牧畜的經騐，以改進品種，反之，他們對於配種的選擇上很不注意，差不多完全聽任馬匹的自由交配，自由生殖，這樣牠的失格損微就越來越多了。再加上不定齒即騎乘，以及先天不足後天失調，所以體尺也一天天的減低，十年前平均體高是一百四十六公分，現在則只一百三十六公分左右了，再加上天天年年放在草原上，有的病死，（患鼻疽和時疫死的最多），有的騎死，有的凍死，有的熱死，有的淹死，有的摔死，也有的幼駒被狼咬死，也有的幼駒被馬蹴死，這種種都是未能作到天災防範疾疫治療和風土訓化的功夫，因而遭受了莫大的損失，以致焉耆馬的質與量都是一天天的減退了。蒙古人雖然是　　生長在馬背上,可是他和他們對於「馬術」除了「騎坐穩固」以外，對於「　的扶助」是簡直不懂的，至於騎馬的姿勢那就更談不上了，同時對於鞍具也是不大講究，都是破破爛爛的東西，這些年來我就很少看到他們騎乘像個樣兒，或者騎出一匹英俊的高頭大馬來，多半是沾泥帶糞的老瘦龍！</p>
<p>最後，我願引用左宗棠的孫子焉耆區行政專員左曙萍的幾句話作為結語：「焉耆是舉世聞名產馬的地方，希望焉耆人是舉世聞名的愛馬的人」！</p>

<p>Because the Communist Party wants to carry the war through to the end, the Communist Party has no sincerity in peace talks and uses them as a cover for the Communist Party's preparations for crossing the river and attacking. On April 20, the government rejected the Communist Party's arrogant eight articles and twenty-four demands. Zhu and Mao ordered a general offensive on all fronts on the 21st, with Taiyuan in the north and Nanjing in the south as their primary targets. Due to various reasons, the main one being that the strength of the bandit army exceeded the local National Revolutionary Army several times, the National Revolutionary Army could no longer hold Taiyuan and could not but quickly make a strategic retreat in Nanjing. As the war situation has progressed to a new stage, the future war situation will change to a shift in roles between host and guest. After the National Revolutionary Army puts down the heavy burden of cities it has been carrying, it will gradually gain the initiative and engage in a long-term war with the bandits. The Communist bandits will henceforth carry many urban burdens, and will inevitably be forced to carry out comprehensive operations. After a long period of attrition, the bandit army will eventually follow in the footsteps of the Japanese invasion of China.</p>
<p>Communist Bandit Military Strategy</p>
<p>The Communist bandits, in view of the failed path of the Japanese warlords, realized that there was no quick victory in the military sense. After occupying Nanjing, the Japanese army did not quickly advance to Wuhan, giving the National Government time to move the government from Nanjing to Wuhan, and then from Wuhan to Chongqing, so the Japanese army finally failed. The Communist bandits' recent and future strategy will be "quick victory," and they hope to end the war this year. The Communist bandits' crossing-the-river offensive has four slogans: "Attack Nanjing, isolate Wuhan, liquidate Shanghai, and smash Guangzhou." This illustrates his strategy of a direct attack to the south, and that after "attacking Nanjing," the main force will go through Jiang, Wan, Gan, and directly to Guangdong. This strategy is ideal, but dangerous. They are going deep into enemy territory, although they rely on the support of local communist elements in Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, and can obtain some supplies and internal support locally. However, the people of South China have a strong and unyielding spirit. They have experienced the Communist bandits' armed uprisings, and they all have experience and lessons in dealing with the Communist Party. They also have considerable organization and strength to deal with the Communist bandits, so the Communist bandits will definitely not be able to do whatever they want. Even if Mao Zedong has formulated deceptive urban policies and industrial and commercial policies, and has repeatedly stated that the actual liquidation of land in Jiangnan will be delayed for five years and that the struggle will be eased, the bandit areas of Tianjin and Northeast North China are all mirrors, and everything is obvious and very clear. This means that the Communist bandits' political strategy does not match his military strategy. His mass base and so-called people's line in South China are very weak, which will make the Communist bandits not dare to venture to drive straight in. Once he encounters resistance, he will stop.</p>
<p>Comparison of Strengths</p>
<p>Over the past year, the strength of the Communist bandits and the National Revolutionary Army has waxed and waned. The reason why the National Revolutionary Army has suffered losses and lost territory is not because the bandit army is strong and has defeated the National Revolutionary Army, but because the Communist bandits used political offensives and propaganda to first disarm the National Revolutionary Army spiritually and deceive young students, peasants, and workers. Therefore, in the Northeast and North China, whether it was Changchun, Shenyang, Jinzhou, or even Beiping and Zhangjiakou, there were no fierce battles. The strength of Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen was not damaged, while the bandit East China Xuzhou team went through an unprecedented battle of more than three months, and the main force of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng was exhausted. Now that the bandit army has undergone four months of reorganization and thorough general mobilization, although dozens of field armies and regular troops have been formed, claiming to be two million people, there are also equal military district reserves and militia. Now, two-thirds of the troops, about 44 armies, have been mobilized to cross the river and attack. This force is considerable in quantity, but in terms of quality, except for Lin Biao's ten armies, the teams of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng are mostly composed of newly gathered people, some of whom are prisoners of the National Revolutionary Army, some are recruits, and the Northeastern youths who were forced to join the army in the Northeast by Lin Biao are unwilling to fight in Jiangnan for a long time. This means that the internal strength of the Communist bandits is very fragile and cannot withstand long-term serious blows. The strength of the National Revolutionary Army, when totaled up, is not less than that of the Communist bandits. It is still superior to the Communist bandits in terms of quantity and quality, although some of it has been recently reorganized and the troops are slightly scattered in various places. Fortunately, since the war will be a long-term war, the National Revolutionary Army has sufficient talent and cadres, and the potential strength of the southeast, northwest, and southwest is still considerable. As long as there are thorough reforms and mobilization methods in terms of morale, popular support, and economic materials, local advantages can still be obtained everywhere. At least it can be said that the strength of the Communist bandits and the National Revolutionary Army is equal.</p>
<p>How to Continue the National Self-Defense War</p>
<p>Because the National Revolutionary Army's forces have not been concentrated quickly, the natural barrier of the Yangtze River has not been well utilized, and the new defense lines in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and South China do not seem strong enough, pessimists and propagandists of the Communist bandits are spreading terror rumors. In the first ten days after the retreat from Nanjing, Shanghai was indeed quite panicked, but after a week of strengthening war preparations, it stabilized. The fighting time in the Shanghai area will be quite long. The National Revolutionary Army still controls hundreds of thousands of strong National Revolutionary Army troops in Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan, Hubei. If the Communist bandits want to go deep into South China to attack Guangdong, they will be severely threatened or attacked on both the left and right flanks. Guangdong also has time to strengthen war preparations. If the potential strength of Guangdong and Guangxi is brought into play, and some troops are transferred from other provinces to Guangdong for reinforcement, it will not be easy, and even impossible, for the Communist bandits to smash Guangzhou in the shortest time. Gaining time, avoiding decisive battles, defending South China, important strategic strongholds, and severely attacking the bandit army are the recent key points of the National Revolutionary Army's operations. With the base of Taiwan and the support of the northwest and southwest, the situation of a long-term war can be formed, and the war can definitely be fought. With total mobilization and comprehensive operations, the military and civilians of the southeast, southwest, and northwest will soon know the Communist bandits' conspiracy to destroy the country and exterminate the race. The local peace of the Beiping style cannot appear again. The Kuomintang and the National Revolutionary Army should thoroughly awaken. Corrupt officials and politicians will run away quickly. Only by thoroughly implementing total war and total mobilization can forces be concentrated. The slogan of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength" during the War of Resistance against Japan should now be changed to "go bankrupt to protect property, risk your life to protect your life." All those who want freedom, survival, and to live should rise up and participate in this long-term comprehensive war, step by step, with each person fighting for themselves. It is not possible without doing so. The revolutionary spirit of Guangdong twenty years ago should be carried forward. The Communist bandit army will be wiped out when it arrives in Guangdong. The rampant momentum of the Communist bandits has reached its peak, and it will decline after this.</p>
<p>The military and civilians of all of China, and especially all of Guangdong, should start taking action, fighting for anti-communism, national salvation, and free survival. The enemy is not scary, there is no need to be pessimistic and negative, everyone should stand up, be strongly united, tightly organized, and fight the Communist bandits to the end. I believe that after a long battle, the Communist bandits will definitely be defeated and the National Revolutionary Army will definitely win.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 9th] According to a certain gentleman from Shashi who came here, since the Communist troops invaded and occupied northern Hubei, various liquidation struggles and forced grain contribution and conscription movements have emerged one after another. Now, the people of Xiangyang, Nanzhang, Yicheng, and other counties, unable to withstand various cruel oppressions, have risen up in resistance, successively destroying dozens of county and district units of the Communist troops, killing dozens of Communist officers and soldiers, and seizing 47 light and heavy machine guns, pistols, rifles, and countless supplies.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 9th] A battle occurred on Xuejiadao, opposite Qingdao. This morning, citizens were awakened by the rumble of artillery fire. The bandits mobilized local communist elements, approximately 10,000 strong, and launched a fierce attack on the National Revolutionary Army's position at 4:00 AM this morning using human wave tactics. They were met with a fierce counterattack by our defending troops. Upon hearing the news, our naval authorities immediately dispatched three warships to assist in the battle, bombarding the bandit army's positions with concentrated fire. The bandits suffered too many losses and began to waver by noon, starting to collapse and retreat. The National Revolutionary Army's pursuit forces have crossed Wujiazhuang and Zhangjiawan and are advancing.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Fuzhou, 9th] Yushan and Qianshan, on the border of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian, have successively issued warnings. The Fujian border is approaching the front lines. Although Wuyi Mountain is a natural barrier, the disturbances of local communist elements are worrying. In order to prevent problems before they occur, the provincial authorities have decided to strengthen measures to meet the needs of the times. It is reported that it has been initially decided to take the county as the basis and decide on two matters of attention for contingencies. In the political aspect, the powers of county magistrates and section chiefs will be increased, forces will be strengthened, security will be ensured, and non-essential organs and undertakings may be reduced or cut as necessary. In the economic aspect, taxes may be collected in silver dollars or in kind, grain administration will be reorganized, arrears of land tax will be urged, grain contributions may be organized as necessary to replenish military food, and self-defense special donations may be organized to provide funds for contingencies. In the military aspect, the promotion of conscription will be actively assisted, and local reputable and capable people will be called upon to lead the people to organize self-defense forces to assist the government in defending their homes. In the social aspect, the stability of local order should be carefully noted, refugees throughout the territory should be properly relieved, and military organs should be assisted in the rescue and placement of wounded and sick officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Fuzhou, 9th] Large armies are gathering in northern Fujian. Zhu Shaoliang declared at the provincial government meeting on the 9th that northern Fujian is peaceful and nothing is happening. All telephones in the province are working smoothly. Only the county magistrate of Guangze County has abandoned his post and fled, and a decision has been made to arrest him. The food problem that everyone is concerned about is also not a cause for concern. 200,000 dan of Jiangxi rice have been exchanged for salt and will be shipped to the province immediately. In addition, the United Logistics Shanghai Equipment Supply Office has 90 million packages of rice stored in eastern Jiangxi, and it is being negotiated to allocate and transport them to Fujian. Furthermore, the provincial government has purchased a large amount of flour in Hong Kong, and the central government has purchased rice in Siam, with a quota of 30,000 tons allocated to Fujian Province, which will be shipped in continuously. Furthermore, Chen Gongbei, Director of the Provincial Land and Grain Office, and He Jie, Director of the Storage and Transportation Section, are scheduled to go to Taiwan on the 10th to negotiate the exchange of Fujian native products, timber, and mushrooms for 100,000 packages of military grain, so the future of food supply in Fujian Province is very promising. Furthermore, Shi Juemin, Deputy Commander of the Fujian Provincial Security Force and Director of the Fuzhou Police Bureau, is scheduled to go to Taiwan on the 10th on official business.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Bai Chongxi Receives Consuls of Various Countries in Hankou; Briefly Reports on Our Current Situation <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 9th] Bai, the Commander of the Central China Military and Political Office, held a tea party at the office at 4:00 PM on the 9th to receive consuls from various countries stationed in Hankou. During the party, Bai made a brief report on the current situation in our country. Bai first stated that since the government advocated peace, it has repeatedly compromised and made the greatest concessions since April. Finally, because the CCP put forward eight articles and twenty-four harsh surrender conditions, peace broke down. The ambition of the communist bandits lies in turning the entire China red and then carrying out their world revolution. Our government is determined to lead the military and civilians of the country to rise up and fight in order to ensure the freedom of speech and life of the people of the country, to save the country and the nation from the current crisis, and to make efforts for world peace. He continued: Wuhan is a strategic location, and war is inevitable. I am sincerely afraid that this will damage the lives and property of foreigners. If the consulates and foreigners stationed in Hankou intend to leave Hankou for other places, this office will do its best to assist and facilitate transportation to ensure safety.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hankou, 9th] Commander Bai Chongxi is scheduled to invite leaders from all walks of life to talk on the morning of the 10th, and will report on the situation in Central China.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Guangdong Needs a Brand New Situation; The Guangzhou Central Daily Publishes an Article <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th] The Central Daily here today published an article entitled "Guangdong Needs a Brand New Situation," stating that the government has already moved south to Guangzhou, so Guangdong's mission for the future history of China is greater than in the past. Although Guangdong has become the actual capital today, the conditions are still inadequate. Therefore, the newspaper believes that Guangdong at this time and place should strengthen its defenses and stabilize its economy. The newspaper first pointed out that the capital where the government is located must have strong defenses. Judging from the current situation in Guangdong, local communist elements are acting recklessly and society is unstable. The other day, Legislative Yuan member Xiao Zheng and others suggested that Guangdong Province should add nine armies. If this point is not easy to succeed, then it can first organize and train the strong private forces that can be utilized. Secondly, the current economic situation in Guangdong is chaotic. The government's reform of the currency system is still in the planning stage, while public utilities and transportation businesses are collecting silver dollars, and the gold round coupon has lost its value as currency. Gold and foreign currencies are causing waves, and the government cannot stop them. People are distracted by the economy and are exhausted, and they inevitably feel indifferent to the suppression measures. The newspaper finally said that the military suppression of bandits has reached the point of close combat, so the security of Guangdong is actually the security of the entire free China. Therefore, it requires the central government to quickly strengthen the military and stabilize the economy, so that Guangdong can be the lighthouse for the revival of China.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Legislative Yuan Committee Review Meeting; President Tong Reports on the Reasons and Process of the Reassembly in Nanjing; Hopes to Form an Investigation Committee to Thoroughly Investigate <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th] The Legislative Yuan held a committee review meeting at 3:00 PM on the 9th. 208 committee members attended, chaired by Xu Yuanquan. First, President Tong reported on the process and evacuation of the reassembly in Nanjing. Then, Secretary-General Chen Kewen reported on the affairs and financial situation, and the process of the Nanjing evacuation. Committee members Peng Chunshi, Pan Yuying, Peng Zhenhuan, Chen Zifeng, Lu Zonglian, and others successively spoke, asking questions about the affairs of the Yuan. Finally, President Tong replied, and hoped that a proposal to form an investigation committee would be formally proposed at the Yuan meeting on the 10th, and that a number of committee members would be elected to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify the truth. If he himself does have illegal activities, he will be dealt with according to the law. He hopes that his colleagues in the Legislative Yuan will not be impulsive and avoid hurting harmony. The meeting was adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>When President Tong reported on the issue of the reassembly in Nanjing, he said that some colleagues did not quite understand this matter. In the past, because there were many problems, there was no opportunity to explain to you. In early February of this year, after the government withdrew from Nanjing, Nanjing was empty and almost became a state of anarchy. Many committee members present today saw this situation. After research by several leaders, I was instructed to fly to Guangzhou with President Yu on February 8 to first invite important leaders to return to Nanjing to support the spiritual power of the Nanjing government, and then engage in stabilizing the military and the people's hearts as a preparation. This situation was not good to announce to the outside world, so President Yu and I agreed in advance to see how the preparations were going here. At that time, the most important thing was to invite President Sun and Vice President Wu to return to Nanjing to make a detailed plan for the overall situation. When I was in Guangzhou, the newspaper published that I had agreed to reassemble in Guangzhou, which was not true.</p>
<p>On February 12, President Yu and I flew to Shanghai. After I reported the situation here, a colleague said, "President, do you think it is better to reassemble in Nanjing or in Guangzhou?" My reply was to listen to the opinions of the majority. Everyone said that they wanted to be in Guangzhou and Guangzhou was ready. If they wanted to be in Nanjing, they would prepare immediately. On the evening of the 13th, I took the car back to Nanjing to report to Acting President Li. On the 16th, I went to Shanghai to attend the symposium. There were more than 100 committee members present. There were many speakers at that time, and after a very enthusiastic discussion, it was unanimously decided to reassemble in Nanjing, and the date was decided by the President of the Yuan. When I returned to Nanjing on the 13th, there were many telegrams and letters from various places. Some of these telegrams and letters advocated reassembling in Nanjing, and some advocated reassembling in Guangzhou. According to the statistics, 300 people advocated reassembling in Nanjing, and more than 100 people advocated reassembling in Guangzhou. After returning to Nanjing from attending the Shanghai symposium, Tong Jingren firmly advocated reassembling in Nanjing and wanted me to announce it on the 17th. I said that the funding problem must be solved first. Later, I negotiated with Minister Xu on funding, and Minister Xu agreed to borrow first. According to the Constitution, the meeting will be reassembled within two months. There are only 28 days in February. Calculating the journey from all sides to Nanjing, it takes at least one week, so it was decided to start registration on the 20th. These are the reasons and processes for the reassembly in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 9th] More than 20 Legislative Yuan members, including Gao Tingzi, flew to Guangzhou on the 9th to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting. Another 40 Legislative Yuan members will fly to Guangzhou in two batches on the 11th and 16th.</p>

<h3 id="e12">In Memory of Deceased Naval Officers and Soldiers: Memorial Service Held Yesterday at the New Life Club; Foreign and Chinese Warships Stationed in Shanghai Fly Flags at Half-Mast for One Day in Mourning <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch] A memorial service for the deceased naval officers and soldiers who sacrificed themselves in suppressing the rebellion, including Captain Lu Weiyuan of the Yongxing warship and over 300 other officers and soldiers, was solemnly held yesterday (the 9th) at 9:00 AM at the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road in this city. Those in attendance included Gui Yongqing, Tang Enbo (represented by Chen Daqing), Fang Zhi, Chen Liang (represented by Shen Chuanli), Wan Wuqing, Xu Mingya, as well as heads of various naval headquarters units, officers and soldiers from various warships, and representatives from various sectors, totaling over 800 people. Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing presided over the ceremony, with Zhou Xianzhang, Dong Muzeng, Ma Deji, Ma Jizhuang, Wang Tianchi, Liu Qingsheng, and Tao Diya serving as accompanying officiants. The hall was filled with wreaths and elegiac couplets, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere. President Chiang Kai-shek presented an inscription that read, "Their Spirit Fills the Rivers and Mountains," He Yingqin offered an elegy that read, "Elite of the Nation," and Tang Enbo's elegy stated, "Join Forces to Stem the Tides, Military Campaigns are Difficult; Summon Souls to the Distant Shores, the River Flows with Sorrowful Sounds." Gui Yongqing's elegy read, "To Preserve the National Pulse, They Sacrificed Themselves for Freedom; The Universe Admires Their Loyalty and Steadfastness, Their Spirit is Immortal; Vowing to Ride the Winds, They Carry on the Legacy Upon Encountering the Red Flames; The Ocean Remains Vast, the Great Cause Ever Renewed." The memorial rituals proceeded in order, lasting for forty minutes, with an atmosphere of solemnity and sorrow throughout.</p>
<p>Following the service, Commander-in-Chief Gui gathered all the naval officers and soldiers present to deliver a brief address. General Gui first expressed his deep sorrow to the deceased officers and soldiers, expressing his infinite regret for not being able to personally visit and comfort the families of the fallen. He continued, "After the heroic and glorious sacrifice of over three hundred of our naval officers and soldiers, it has proven that ninety percent of the Chinese Navy has ambition, courage, ideals, and understanding. Our naval officers and soldiers are all incomparably loyal and brave warriors. In the past, everyone greatly neglected the Navy." General Gui Yongqing, speaking of the heroic and glorious sacrifice of Warden Lu Weiyuan of the Yongxing warship and other officers and soldiers, moved all the officers and soldiers in attendance to tears. "After the test and lessons of the blood of these heroes, it also proves that the fighting spirit of the Chinese Navy is more magnificent than that of any navy in the world's history. Therefore, the combat path that our Chinese Navy takes is more difficult, magnificent, and heroic." General Gui said, "Only those who do not enjoy killing can unify China." He said, "Facing our enemy - the Communist Party that betrays the nation - our naval officers and soldiers must remember these bloody lessons and fight even more bravely." "Today is the most difficult time of our revolution, especially for the Navy. We must further recognize that this most difficult time is also our most glorious time. We must be more ambitious, courageous, and determined, and fight even more bravely. Continuing the fighting spirit of the eight hundred fifty nautical miles along the Yangtze River, we must create an even stronger force in naval operations and eliminate the enemy."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the naval warships of the United States and Britain stationed in Shanghai, as well as the various fleets and naval combat command units under the Chinese Navy, in order to mourn the Chinese naval officers and soldiers who died in the suppression of the rebellion, specially flew their flags at half-mast for one day yesterday, the "9th."</p>
<p>Memorial Oration at the Memorial Service</p>
<p>The memorial oration at the memorial service is as follows: "On this ninth day of May in the thirty-eighth year of the Republic of China, Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, leading all officers and soldiers, respectfully offers incense, flowers, and spiced wine in sacrifice before the spirits of the naval officers and soldiers who died in suppressing the rebellion, saying: 'We are the rhinoceros-armored force, the Great Wall on the rivers and seas; our warships cleave the waves, under the moon and stars. From the beginning of our military construction, we have been determined to be vigorous and refined, hoping to build up our strength and consolidate peace. But the red flames have grown fiercer day by day, bringing disaster to the country and harming the people. The three armies join forces to suppress the rebellion and rectify names. The Northern Fleet supports our warships in rapid voyages, eliminating the enemy along the Yangtze and Huai rivers, earning remarkable prestige. But the lurking dragons stirred and moved, forming a turbulent current. Over thousands of miles of waterway, every night brings surprises. Day and night, we are vigilant, guarding against the lurking bandits. We are the mainstay in the torrent, engaging in relentless cannon battles. Our officers and soldiers fight bravely, their will forged in iron, vowing to guard the natural barrier in order to restore the nation. Though arms are broken and heads severed, our steadfastness is strengthened. We stand firm, as stable as the mountains and as deep as the abyss. The landscape has changed color, the Central Plains have sunk into darkness. We sacrifice ourselves to repay the nation, heroically achieving benevolence. Alas, my compatriots, you have fought a hundred battles and sacrificed your lives. Alive, you were fighters; in death, you are heroic spirits. The river water is endless, the sea waves connect to the sky. Our banners are in sight, ready to face the winds. Your great ambitions have not been fulfilled, our desire to restore the nation remains the same. Return, O souls, and guide our vanguard. Alas!'"</p>
<h3 id="e13">Opinion of U.S. Military Officials in Tokyo: Communist Attack on Hong Kong Could Lead to World War III <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] Reliable British sources here confirm that the Communists will attack Hong Kong. Some U.S. officials stationed in Japan doubt whether the approval of the Atlantic Pact necessarily requires the United States to participate in the defense of British colonies. A well-informed British source said on the 9th that whether Hong Kong will be attacked is no longer a question; the question is when it will be attacked. The Communists have repeatedly demanded the elimination of all foreign influence from Chinese territory. The Communist army shelled British warships in the Yangtze River. Neutral observers say that the Communists are clearly not afraid of Britain. They believe that the Communists will inevitably clash with Britain over Hong Kong, at least diplomatically.</p>
<p>At the same time, if the Communists attack Hong Kong, the question of whether the Atlantic Pact countries will assist each other outside the North Atlantic area will arise. Some U.S. military officials here believe that if Britain and the Communists actually clash in Hong Kong, it will form a potential trigger for World War III; therefore, it is a conflict between the East and West blocs. Some people believe that if the Atlantic Pact is not limited by region, U.S. forces stationed in Japan may rush to Hong Kong to assist in the defense, but this must await orders from the Supreme Command in Washington.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 8th] The Daily Mail's editorial on the 8th, titled "Britain's Crisis in China," stated: "The Western blockade has just ended; when will the Eastern blockade begin? Hong Kong may become a second Berlin. Has the government prepared Hong Kong to deal with possible aggression? The United States and Britain should be united on this point. Hong Kong is an important part of the American Pacific border. The Soviet Union has almost lost a battle in the West, but they hope to lose in the West and gain in the East. If we recognize in time that Hong Kong is a new political symbol of our determination to resist Communist oppression, the Soviet Union may also fail in the East."</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Taipei Dispatch, 9th] The Huahai ship, which sailed to Taiwan from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 2nd, was found to have three Communist conspirators on board when it arrived at Keelung Harbor on the 5th. One of them escaped.</p>
<h3 id="e18">From Wuhu to Shanghai <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report for This Newspaper] Recently, this reporter's relative, Mr. Xu, escaped from the Communist-controlled area and arrived in Shanghai. This reporter made a special visit to him. Mr. Xu had been doing business in Wuhu. This time, he left Wuhu and returned east on the 23rd of last month when Wuhu fell. He passed through Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places, braving the elements and experiencing hardship. It took him more than ten days to reach Shanghai. The areas mentioned above have been cut off from news from Shanghai since their fall. There must be many people along the Nanjing-Shanghai line who have family members in these areas and are very concerned about the recent situation in their hometowns. Therefore, the following is a compilation of what I learned from the meeting, to share with the readers of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Evacuation from Wuhu</p>
<p>Wuhu was originally defended by the 20th Army under Yang Gancai. On the evening of the 21st of last month, Yang's troops received news that they were about to withdraw. On the 22nd, the families of the soldiers began to depart first. That evening, Yang's troops also received official orders to withdraw. Upon hearing the news, the people of Wuhu panicked and fled with the elderly and the young. Mr. Xu also rushed to the Jiangnan Railway Station with the crowded crowd on the morning of the 23rd. He managed to buy a ticket and climbed onto the roof of the train. The train left eastward around 8:00 AM and arrived at Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. It was precisely during the vacuum period when the National Army was withdrawing and the Communist Army had not yet arrived. The situation in Nanjing was chaotic. Robberies occurred frequently. All the shops were closed, and many large windows were shattered into powder. Even street vendors were hard to find. The streets were filled with all kinds of people. The Communist Army had not yet entered the city that day, but colorful slogans had already been posted all over the streets. Mr. Xu was fortunate to meet an old man named Ji and stayed at his house because it was impossible to find a hotel at that time. Two days later, the old man introduced him to a room in the house of a woman in Xiaguan so that he could wait for the train to return east. The newly built Junzhan Building in Xiaguan was completely destroyed, almost razed to the ground. He heard that the train service had been restored, but it was for military use and civilians were not allowed to ride.</p>
<p>On the Road from Nanjing to Changzhou</p>
<p>Mr. Xu stayed in Nanjing for several days and went back and forth between Xiaguan and Hepingmen several times, but he had no chance to get on the train. Just when he was feeling depressed, he met a friend named Xu at Hepingmen, who also planned to come to Shanghai. So they agreed to travel together. Finally, on the morning of May 1st, they took a truck to Zhenjiang for the price of one silver dollar per person, just like traveling on the inland highways in the past. It was very emotional. After arriving in Zhenjiang around 4:00 PM, they had some congee and rushed to the train station. Mr. Xu and others repeatedly pleaded with the Communist sentries. Until 12:00 AM at night, they were allowed to enter the platform. They saw a locomotive with its fire lit, waiting to depart. After inquiring, they learned that it was going to Danyang, so they climbed onto the locomotive. After about an hour, the Communist troops arrived and boarded the train one after another. Then the train traveled east. At dawn, the train stopped at Lingkou. Mr. Xu and others had not slept all night and were hungry. They walked to Benniu and had a meal around 1:00 PM. They also tried to find a vehicle and finally took a car to Changzhou for the price of eight dimes of silver dollars per person and stayed at the hotel. Shops in Zhenjiang and Changzhou were already open, but there were very few customers.</p>
<p>City Scenes of Suzhou and Wuxi</p>
<p>The next morning, he found a small steamship to Wuxi, which cost one and a half silver dollars per person. He arrived around noon. Without having a meal, he transferred to a boat to Suzhou and arrived around 4:00 PM. Suzhou and Wuxi still seemed quite lively on the surface. On the way, gold yuan could no longer be used. In addition to silver dollars, people's currency, and Central China currency, nickel coins and lead coins also became commonly used auxiliary currencies. The general cost of living was very high. The price of rice in Zhenjiang and Suzhou was about eight silver dollars per load.</p>
<p>After staying in Suzhou for one night, he took a sailboat the next morning and traveled to Lujiabang, which took about a day and a half. He arrived safely at Lujiabang and then took the Nanjing-Shanghai train to Shanghai.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Jiuquan Dispatch, 9th] This year's new well, K-15, at the Yumen Oil Mine, has reached a depth of 993 meters, breaking the mine's record of 972 meters for well depth. It is extremely beneficial to the geological research of the oil field there. However, because the well will produce a large amount of salt water after completion, it has been decided to temporarily close it in order to avoid wasting materials.</p>

Yang was under the order of General Song Xilian and was traveling with Dai Jitao and Shi Honggui from Changde to Fenghuang to visit Chen Quzhen. After completing the task, he left Fenghuang with Gu Jiaqi and was tragically killed.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 8th] Several Chinese government officials are about to fly to Bangkok to assist China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and the Siamese government in negotiations to allow CNAC aircraft to land in Bangkok in order to expand its Southeast Asian routes to Singapore. According to CNAC personnel here, the Chinese government hopes that the negotiations will be completed quickly and are unrelated to the domestic situation in China. It is also not preparing to transport evacuees to Singapore on CNAC planes. Although CNAC planes can fly directly from Hong Kong to Singapore, it is not very profitable without intermediate landing stations, so it is necessary to negotiate landing rights with the Siamese government.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Editorial: The Price Problem at the Present Stage <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Since the price control dam collapsed, the gold yuan has followed the old path of the late legal tender. Initially, the rate of price increases was still very slight, and the period of fluctuations was still cyclical. But today, due to the dramatic changes in the objective situation and the excessive expansion of credit, prices are changing every day, especially in Guangzhou, where prices are rising several times a day, which is most alarming.</p>
<p>Taking Guangzhou's prices last week as an example, the Hong Kong dollar opened at 1 million yuan on Friday and closed at 900,000 yuan. Gold was 405 yuan per bar in Hong Kong dollars, U.S. dollars were 5.6 million yuan, and silver dollars were 6.5 million yuan. But by Saturday, the price surge rose sharply. The Hong Kong dollar rose to 2.1 million yuan, the U.S. dollar to 13 million yuan, and the silver dollar to 14 million yuan. The change in just one night was so huge that it was unbelievable, or like a feeling of being separated by a lifetime. The eras of the German mark, the Russian ruble, the Hungarian pengő, were probably not so bad. Therefore, not only ordinary people have no way to cope with life, but even the senior officials in charge of finance are feeling helpless. If this continues, what will become of the national economy and people's livelihood!</p>
<p>The recent surge in prices is superficially due to popular unrest and market chaos, but it is actually caused by the malignant inflation of the gold yuan and the shrinking of production capacity. Originally, everything in the world accumulates gradually and erupts suddenly. There is no such thing as a miracle that "falls from the sky." Moreover, the current complex and multifaceted prices are not that simple. Especially today's currency and prices promote and cycle each other, which is one and two, and two and one. To achieve overall economic stability, it is necessary to take a two-pronged approach: control issuance on one hand, and control prices and increase production on the other, in order to be effective. Finance Minister Liu stated in his speech in Guangzhou that the recent price increases were due to the issuance of local currency in various places, which crowded out the gold yuan. This is actually a seemingly correct but actually incorrect assertion.</p>
<p>Although the issuing agency is keeping the number of gold yuan issued secret, we can assert that it has exceeded the amount of legal tender issued in the past, due to the massive military and administrative expenses that are taken at will. In addition, the area of use is shrinking, so the gold yuan flooded the market, and a natural depreciation occurred. At the same time, after Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places were successively abandoned, the general situation changed rapidly. People bought materials or gold notes to preserve purchasing power. Due to the rush to abandon the gold yuan, prices became more expensive and the value of the currency fell. Moreover, the government's "magic weapon" for stabilizing the value of the currency - the policy of buying and selling - has been impossible to implement since the gold and silver were transported south. Therefore, how can we blame the currency for its tragic fall? How can we blame prices for soaring?</p>
<p>According to the principle of prices, prices can remain balanced if the increase in currency is matched by an increase in the supply of materials. However, under the current conditions of traffic disruption and transportation paralysis, there are major problems in the procurement of raw materials and the supply of power and fuel. If we purchase from abroad, the exchange rate is extremely high, which increases the burden of costs. This will inevitably cause the price of products to be lower than the cost, and how can manufacturers maintain operations? In addition, recently, due to the turbulent situation, bankers are mostly concerned about the safety of loans and investments, and the financing of industrial capital is becoming increasingly difficult. As a result, the allocation of manufacturers' operating funds cannot be carried out smoothly. In addition, in recent years, North China has experienced water shortages, and the general purchasing power is extremely weak, resulting in sluggish sales and hindering the output of products. Even if products are reluctantly sold at low prices, it is difficult to replenish raw materials. On the other hand, due to heavy taxes and high wages, various difficult factors make industrialists hesitate and feel extremely disheartened, resulting in a pessimistic attitude. Therefore, the phenomenon of suspending work and reducing production is everywhere. At this time, although industry has stalled and legitimate business is in decline, speculation and hoarding are rampant. People are addicted to the侥倖"get rich quick" mentality of "gaining without labor." How can we expect productive efficiency and increased supply of materials in this kind of murky environment? On the contrary, the imbalance between supply and demand makes prices more expensive. Facing such a dangerous situation, how can the authorities suppress prices if they do not start from the fundamental issue of increasing the supply of materials?</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the current torrent of prices has destroyed the structure of the economy, and the prospects for prices are even bleaker. This situation is extremely serious. The stability of the economy depends on prices. The prerequisite for stabilizing prices is only to start by stopping the policy of inflating the currency, slowing down the circulation rate of the currency, and strengthening the production mechanism. Otherwise, everything is empty talk.</p>

<p>[United Press, Bonn, Germany, 8th] The first constitution of the German government since Hitler's defeat was established today. The West German Constituent Assembly passed its third reading minutes before midnight on the fourth anniversary of the victory. Fifty-three voted in favor, and only one Communist and ten Bavarian right-wingers voted against it. Bavarian representatives said that the new constitution failed to give sufficient power to the states. The Communists have always opposed the independent establishment of a West German state. The Constituent Assembly has been discussing for eight months, and when the final voting results were announced today, there was a thunderous applause from the audience. The Speaker will send a copy of the constitution to the military governors of the three occupying powers, Britain, France, and the United States, for approval. The constitution contains 146 articles, stipulating the establishment of a federal democratic government to govern the 46 million people in the American, British, and French occupation zones of West Germany, pending the establishment of a unified German government. Elections will be held in the three occupation zones to form a parliament. The new government is scheduled to take office on July 15. The new constitution also stipulates that the red, black, and gold flag of the Weimar Republic will be the national flag of West Germany, completing a historic event. The Bonn Constitution opens a new page in German history, and the era of Nazi dictatorship and death cell terror officially ends from this point forward. The new constitution also stipulates the abolition of the death penalty, no army, and neither the president nor the parliament has the power to declare war. Conspirators of aggression will be severely punished, and national sovereignty belongs to the European Federation. People, regardless of gender, race, creed, language, or political views, have freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and belief. Censorship of post, telegraph, and news is absolutely prohibited. The new constitution adopts the British and American model, giving specified powers to the federal government, while the remaining powers are reserved by the states. The parliament adopts a bicameral system.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 9th] The premiers of the eleven West German states will meet in Godesberg on Friday to discuss various issues following the adoption of the Bonn Constitution.</p>

<p>[United Press, Berlin, 9th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin flew to the British-occupied zone of Germany from the Tempelhof US military airfield today. US Military Governor Clay personally saw him off at the airport. Before departing, Bevin happily told reporters, "The upcoming Paris Four Foreign Ministers Meeting will plan for world peace."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin stated here today that when the Foreign Ministers Meeting convenes in Paris on May 23rd, resolutions will be reached based on a final peace treaty settlement. Bevin emphasized that efforts must be made to obtain a plan that allows the people of Europe to join hands and prosper together. Bevin arrived here yesterday from London to inspect the Berlin airlift situation. He delivered a speech to West Berlin city officials, stating: "If I had come here a week ago, I could only lament with you. But today, the dark clouds have dissipated, and the future appears brighter. Britain opposes any totalitarian system, whether it be communist totalitarianism or Nazi totalitarianism. We believe that mankind must have spiritual freedom, so that they have no fear in their existence." This morning, Foreign Secretary Bevin addressed British troops, stating that the airlift would continue, and British troops must continue to be stationed in Germany to fulfill their responsibilities. At a press conference, Bevin also stated, "I believe that the real key to peace lies in maintaining stability in Europe for at least two hundred years, which of course requires diligent work and patience. I hope that the German region of Berlin will be filled with freedom, with free elections and free newspapers. I want to see the German people freely use their strength to rebuild their cities. A country or a city can only survive based on the spirit of freedom." Speaking of the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, Bevin said that the four powers must find a way at this conference to achieve a proper solution to the entire European problem. A reporter asked if the chances of success at this meeting were better than they were eighteen months ago. Bevin said that at least they were no worse than before. A reporter also asked if developments in the Far East were more important than developments in Europe. Bevin firmly replied in the negative. A reporter asked for the reason for the Communist Party's policy change. Bevin replied that he could not answer this question because he was not a member of Communist politics. Bevin is staying at the residence of British Army Commander-in-Chief General Robertson in Berlin. This morning, he met there with US Governor Clay, British Governor Robertson, and French Deputy Governor Noiret for over an hour.</p>

<p>[United Press, Berlin, 8th] American and German figures here are discussing that the Four Foreign Ministers Meeting may order the simultaneous circulation of East and West German Marks throughout the country to end Germany's currency dispute. According to this method, Germans can set prices themselves and express their willingness to use it to determine the true value of the two Marks, and Western countries and the Soviet Union can also safely step down. US military government officials and some Germans say that this compromise is very possible because the dual currency system is a major issue in the Cold War against Germany.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] The radio broadcasting war between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union resumed at 3:15 this afternoon when the BBC and the Voice of America began broadcasting news in Russian. Only one minute after the English and American radio stations began broadcasting in Russian, powerful Soviet radio stations focused their radio waves to interfere with the Western radio stations. Here, it can be found that most of Moscow's domestic radio stations are silent and are slowly moving wavelengths until the strange noise overwhelms the voices of the Western radio stations. When the Russian-language broadcasts of the Western radio stations ended, the Soviet interference also stopped. The voices of Moscow radio became clearly audible again. Previously, Moscow Radio criticized the BBC and the Voice of America, accusing them of deliberately suppressing the growth of peaceful and democratic forces.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Eastern European Satellite States Act Independently, Molotov's Plan Fails, Political Disputes Between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Lead to Economic Warfare <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The United States has learned from behind the Iron Curtain that the Soviet Union's "Molotov Plan," which intended to promote the production of its satellite states, seems to have failed halfway. Poland and Czechoslovakia behind the Iron Curtain organized the "Council for Mutual Economic Assistance" at the beginning of this year, guaranteeing to increase production within the year, with the plan of using the production of the entire region to seek the welfare of the entire region. However, the countries are still acting independently and are not helping each other.</p>
<p>For example, Czechoslovakia dismantled textile machines, while Hungary added new textile factories. Molotov had allowed the satellite states to invest approximately 3 billion yuan in industry, but several countries are establishing the same enterprises, not afraid of future overproduction. After the Soviet Union monopolized the Danube River, shipping plummeted to only one-tenth of what it was when the river was open. The countries along the river also manage navigation independently. Moscow's greatest difficulty seems to be Yugoslavia, Premier Tito, and political accusations by the Kremlin. The South Communist Party's newspaper "Borba" stated that the Moscow Radio's claim that the Soviet Union provided South with 500,000 tons of wheat in 1944 was a lie. In fact, it was only 50,000 tons. The Soviet Union demanded that the South exchange 370 tons of aluminum sand for a Soviet traction line, which was very unfair in price. The Soviet Union also required Yugoslav students in Moscow to pay fees in US dollars, which further depleted the South's foreign exchange. Moscow seems to have stopped transporting industrial machinery to the South and has withdrawn Soviet technicians from the South, which has made Tito the most annoyed. In a speech, Tito pointed out that Moscow intended to suppress the industrialization of the South, and Yugoslavia was unwilling to continue to be a supplier of raw materials. The situation in Romania is also not optimistic. Romania's national industry is managed by eight Romanian joint committees. The Soviet Union has ordered a large number of heavy industrial machines from Romania, but the Romanian Communist government has expressed dissatisfaction. At the same time, Soviet policy observers have discovered that Stalin has long wanted to use the Soviet Union's neighboring countries. Stalin had a book in 1920, "Soviet Policy and National Issues," which stated, "The Soviet center of the world revolution cannot be sustained for a long time without the assistance of neighboring countries rich in raw materials, fuel, and food."</p>

<h3 id="e48">Amateur Tennis King, Kramer Talks About Tennis Experience <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] Tennis king Kramer announced today that he has been smooth sailing since going professional and can still dominate the professional tennis world for more than three years, maintaining his reputation as a winning army. Kramer is now performing in London. He said: "If someone rises up in the future and can often defeat me, then I will completely withdraw from the competition." Kramer is only 28 years old and is recognized as the best tennis player in the world. In 1947, he won three awards and enjoyed a salary of $100,000 per year. Kramer talked about the golden age of tennis players. He said: "If tennis players can take good care of themselves and improve their courage slightly, they can maintain their momentum until they are 32 years old. But this is very difficult. I must limit drinking beer and forbid drinking whiskey."</p>
<p>Kramer led a team to Europe in March to perform. The team members included Riggs from the United States, Bales from Australia, and Segura from Ecuador. Kramer's usual opponent is Riggs. Since December 1947, Kramer has won eight or nine out of ten games between the two. Therefore, Kramer hopes that new players in the amateur tennis world will join the professional world this year. Kramer believes that among the amateur tennis players this year, there is hope of winning the three major tennis championships (Wimbledon Championship, US Championship, and Davis Cup Championship) for Schroeder and Gonzalez of the United States and Brownweich of Australia. Schroeder is Kramer's old partner. The two have collaborated twice in 1946 and 1947 to win the Davis Cup. Gonzalez is a 20-year-old young player who has won the three major American clay court and indoor tennis championships. Brownweich has been unlucky for many years, but Kramer said: "He has had good luck since coming to the United States this year, or he may be lucky." The other three hopefuls are Vandenberg, the 1948 Wimbledon champion from the United States, Parker, a veteran from Los Angeles, and Quloni, a Czech left-handed player. Kramer criticized Quloni, saying: "Quloni is worthy of being a general, but unfortunately, he lacks stamina and cannot fight three major battles in a week. This kind of encounter must occur in the Wimbledon competition."</p>
<p>Any one of the above six people only needs to win the championship in the amateur tennis world in the next six months, and there will be ready-made opportunities to make a fortune waiting for him. Kramer said: "It is not difficult for me to drag him into the sea. I just need to show him my savings book. In the first year of going professional, I earned 115,000 yuan."</p>

<h3 id="e51">Another Upset in Group B Table Tennis: Yucai Overwhelms Seeded New Star <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Today, Group A Silk White vs. Bank of China</p>
<p>In the 4th Table Tennis League, a shocking upset occurred in Group B, Division Three, the day before yesterday. The seeded team New Star was unexpectedly defeated by Yucai by a lopsided score of 1-4, which was astonishing. The young players of Yucai initially did not expect to win, but unexpectedly, Zhuang Tingfang achieved victory in the first match, which boosted the morale of the other young players. New Star suffered a setback due to the defeat of their star player Gao Shangzhi. The second and third matches were also uncertain, which was unfortunate. The entire team only managed to win back one point through their main player Wang Xiuguang. As a result, Yucai achieved a great victory over New Star with a score of 4-1, which can be considered a remarkable achievement. According to League Secretary Chen Linsheng, the seeded team Ling in Group B, Division One, has already been defeated by the Red and White team. The seeded team China Merchants in Division Two was defeated by Fansheng. This battle witnessed the young players of Yucai overwhelming the seeded New Star in Division Three. It can be said that the younger generation is surpassing the older generation, which is a significant achievement of this league and is worth celebrating. However, it is hoped that the winners will not be arrogant and the losers will not be discouraged, but will strengthen their research on technical deficiencies, improve their standards, and strive to become outstanding talents. The scores of both sides and the results of previous matches are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yucai　Score　New Star</p>
<p>Zhuang Tinghang　21-19 21-19　Gao Shangzhi</p>
<p>Chen Gongbai　21-12 19-21 21-17　Shen Huanzhong</p>
<p>Li Yaogi　21-19 20-22 21-16　Qin Yulian</p>
<p>Gong Jianren　16-21 12-21　Wang Xiuguang</p>

<p>China Agriculture defeated Railway (B2) 3-2</p>
<p>Youlian defeated Post 18 (B2) 3-2</p>
<p>Jianxin defeated Red and White (B1) 3-2</p>
<p>Today (the 10th), there will be one match in Group A and four matches in Group B. In Group A, Silk White will face the Bank of China. The two sides have played four matches each, with equal wins and losses and equal points. Their results are better than the two strong teams Qinglian and Post B. Tonight, they will meet, and they can be called evenly matched opponents. A fierce battle is inevitable. Among the four matches in Group B, only the United team in Division Two is undefeated. In this battle against Tianxiang, they will naturally strive to defend their territory. Tianxiang has the veteran Lin Binru to help, and the team's morale is very high. They are determined to break the United team's winning streak, and a fierce battle is expected. The schedule for today and the list of players for the two teams in Group A are recorded below:</p>
<p>Silk White——Bank of China (Group A) 7:00 PM Silk Industry</p>
<p>Railway——Starfire (B2) 6:00 PM Mental Hospital</p>

<p>The Football Committee announced yesterday the schedule for this week's football league. There will be two matches in Group A on Saturday and Sunday (the 14th and 15th), which will still be played at Yiyuan. China Airlines vs. Zhichao, Leader vs. Railway. This will be the end of this year's league, and the football season will also come to a close. The Football Committee announced that during the Qingbai vs. Zhichao match on the 7th, Zhichao player Zhu Jia-Zheng fell in a rough manner and was given a warning.</p>
<p>In the China Airlines vs. Zhichao match on Saturday, the former won with a score of 1-0 in the first round. Zhichao should seek revenge. However, there is talk of China Airlines forfeiting the match, which remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The battle between Leader and Railway has been problematic in the two matches of the league, which is regrettable. This rematch should not have any more complications. Railway is the champion of the Mayor's Cup, and last week they drew with Qingbai, which shows their strong fighting spirit. Leader's northern style has become a unique style, with bold moves and brilliant performances. When they meet Railway, it is still unknown who will win. This week's program is recorded below:</p>
<p>May 14 (Saturday)</p>
<p>China Airlines——Zhichao (Group A) 4:00 PM Yiyuan</p>
<p>May 15 (Sunday)</p>
<p>Leader——Railway (Group A Rematch) 4:00 PM Yiyuan</p>

<h3 id="e55">Water, Electricity, Gas, and Telephone Fees Temporarily Paid at 370,000 Times <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Do not cut off water and electricity to those who have not paid beyond the time limit</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Public Utility Bureau has notified various companies to pay water, electricity, gas, and telephone fees in accordance with the decision of the Municipal Council, temporarily based on the salary index of 370,000 times. However, some companies refused to accept payment yesterday. According to Acting Director Gu Zhenbai of the Public Utility Bureau, the notice has been issued, and the companies may not have been fully informed. It is expected that there will be no more refusals to accept payment starting today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council's Public Utility Subcommittee rejected the method of charging fees for the four public utilities of water, electricity, gas, and telephone based on the pricing index and decided to temporarily pay at an index of 370,000 times. However, the public utility companies refused to accept payment because they had not yet received a notice from the municipal government, causing general citizens to feel bewildered. If they temporarily delay payment, they fear that the companies will cut off their water and electricity. For this reason, the reporter specifically consulted Mayor Chen. According to Chen, he immediately notified the Public Utility Bureau to inform the companies that they must not cut off water and electricity to users who have not paid beyond the deadline before a new pricing method is decided. He also said that the primary task of Mr. Liu Xiqi, whom he has appointed as the director of the Public Utility Bureau, is to solve the problem of public utility prices. He has asked Liu to gather experts to study the expenses of each company and determine whether there are any wasteful or unreasonable expenses, and to try to lower their prices as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Grain Storage Committee Allocates 2,000 Metric Tons of Rice for Public Utility Grain Reserve to Ensure Work Is Not Affected by Grain Shortages in Future Emergency Situations <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Emergency Grain Purchase and Storage Committee has recently allocated 2,000 metric tons of rice to the city's public utilities for emergency grain reserves. The storage of this grain will ensure that all public utilities in the city will not be affected by grain shortages in future emergencies (especially the supply of water and electricity).</p>
<p>The allocation of emergency grain storage is based on the resolution of a meeting convened by the US Economic Cooperation Administration on the 1st of this month. The main principles decided at that time were as follows: (1) The US Economic Cooperation Administration and the Grain Storage Committee agreed that, without affecting the principle of household rice rations, the Grain Storage Committee would immediately allocate 2,000 metric tons of rice, specifically for the emergency use of employees and direct dependents of various public utility companies. (2) The amount of emergency reserve rice for employees and direct dependents of the above public utility companies shall be based on 30 jin (2 shi dou) per person, with each employee and their direct dependents calculated as a standard of four people. (3) After the above rice is transported to the location of the company, the company shall be responsible for proper storage and shall not be used until the household rice rations are suspended.</p>
<p>There are a total of 17 public utility institutions preparing emergency grain reserves, with a total of over 115,000 employees and dependents. All of this emergency grain has now been allocated to the Civil Affairs Bureau for receipt and distribution. Although the use of grain storage is stipulated to be at the time when household rice rations are suspended, this provision is only hypothetical. It is hoped that citizens will not misunderstand that it will be suspended soon, because the rations for May and June in the city have been fully raised, and the rations after July are also being actively prepared by the Grain Storage Committee, the US Economic Cooperation Administration, and the local authorities.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Chen Zhiju, Chen Guangduo, Kong Fanheng, and Wei Yutang, all from Qingpu, were previously employed at the land tax administration office of the Qingpu County government. Due to the unrest, they came to Shanghai to seek refuge and lived in the building at 1537 Pingliang Road in Pudong. Because they did not have Shanghai ID cards, they felt uneasy and entrusted Guo Qitai, a friend living at 21 Lane 1 Longchang Road, to find a way. Guo then entrusted Chen Yiming, a security officer, to handle the matter. Chen et al. paid six cans of kerosene and two silver dollars as a reward and obtained five blank ID cards. Chen et al. forged the Shanghai municipal government seal model and filled out fake ID cards from 70 North Hai Road. Unexpectedly, the scheme was discovered. Someone reported to the Laozha Police Station, and Chief Cai instructed the Second Division to investigate. Inspector Wang Anbang led the police to rush there yesterday and arrested Chen Zhiju and the other three people, confiscating the fake ID cards on their persons. They were taken back to the branch office for investigation. The other two people, Guo Qitai and Chen Yiming, are on the run and are being pursued.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] At the end of last year, military authorities in Nanjing and Shanghai uncovered an organization called the "Kuomintang Reform Committee" in Nanjing and Shanghai that plotted to overthrow the government. They arrested key criminals, including Meng Shiheng, the chairman of the Nanjing branch of the committee, Wu Shiwu, the propaganda committee member of the branch, and Xiao Jiankui, a deserter from the Communications Company of the 7th Regiment of the Military Police. After repeated interrogations by the authorities, they were sentenced to death according to martial law and approved by Commander-in-Chief Tang. They were executed by firing squad at the Song Park execution ground at 3:00 PM yesterday by the police bureau, with Si Daoping, the commander of the garrison police, serving as the execution supervisor. Before the execution, the three criminals sang the national anthem and shouted slogans. According to the police bureau, Meng Shiheng, 44 years old, from Jilin, was the head of the "Kuomintang Reform Committee Nanjing Branch" organized by Li Jishen. Meng was appointed as the director of the branch by Wang Baozhen, a special envoy of the committee in Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Six Conspiracies</p>
<p>He led this conspiracy organization in Nanjing, with various departments such as labor movement, youth, public education, and military personnel. He specifically sent people to recruit wavering elements from the party, government, military, police, and constitution, attempting to incite rebellion, conspire to overthrow the government, respond to the communist troops crossing the Yangtze River, and decided on six conspiracies. (1) Control the airport, (2) Cut off transportation trunk lines, (3) Detain key government officials (including Acting President Li, Commander-in-Chief Tang, Director Huang, Mayor Teng, etc.), (4) Establish the People's Liberation Committee, (5) Establish the Nanjing People's Government, (6) Respond to the communist troops crossing the Yangtze River. Wu Shiwu, 36 years old, from Harbin, was appointed as the propaganda committee member of the branch by Meng Shiheng. The announcements posted by the branch in Nanjing were mostly written by him. He once planned to represent Meng Shiheng to meet with the communist army leaders in Jiangbei to discuss plans to cross the Yangtze River. Xiao Jiankui, also known as Xiao Chengyu, 25 years old, from Shenyang, Northeast China, was a private in the Communications Company of the 7th Regiment of the Military Police. On October 29th last year, he was seduced by Sun Shanshu, a communist spy dispatched by the First Military Sub-district of the Communist Army's Jianghuai Military Region, and was ordered to incite wavering elements of the military police regiment to join the communist organization and conspire to riot in Nanjing. Unexpectedly, the scheme was discovered and arrested. The above criminals were found to be true after interrogation and were sentenced to death.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Western medicine merchant Zhang Zhengxiong has an office at 645 Jiujiang Road, buying and selling Western medicines on behalf of customers. Several months ago, Si Zhiyu, a fellow dealer with a familiar face, bought 600 dozen Tiger Balm Yong An Tang Balms and 400 dozen Bagua Dans from him. Si signed an immediate check for 840,000 yuan, but it bounced due to insufficient funds. Afterwards, Zhang urgently searched for him to no avail and reported the case to the police bureau, asking them to investigate and arrest him. He also inquired if any large quantities of Tiger Balm, etc., were being sold on the market. He later learned that a large number of Bagua Dan and Tiger Balm of unknown origin had been found at Liang Yu's place at 2 Lane 423 Jinling East Road. He notified the police bureau to send people to investigate and recover the goods, totaling 200 dozen. According to Liang's confession, it was indeed Si Zhiyu who sent them to repay debts. In addition to ordering him to be released on bail pending trial, the stolen medicines were handed over to Zhang for retrieval first. The police are still continuing to arrest Si and bring him to justice.

<h3 id="e70">Decision to Abolish Security Donation, A New Method of Levy Will Be Developed for Subsidizing Troop Provisions <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of abolishing or retaining the security donation in the city, Mayor Chen convened representatives of the industrial sector, such as Liu Hongsheng, for a meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. According to Chen, the total amount obtained from the security donation to date is only 54 billion yuan, which is a very small amount and does not help matters. Moreover, there must be a lot of leakage in the middle. Therefore, Commander-in-Chief Tang advocated abolishing it and not collecting it again. Another method of levy will be developed to replace this donation to make up for the shortage of funds for subsidizing troop provisions.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Food Rice Supply and Demand are Both Scarce, Early Thin Rice Knocks on the 30 Million Mark in the Southern Market <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market slightly rose in the southern market and stabilized in the northern market. Market transactions became increasingly sluggish due to the scarcity of both supply and demand. White japonica early rice and indica rice were both priced at 29.2 million yuan in the southern market, with thin rice knocking on the 30 million mark, an increase of 2 million yuan compared to last Saturday. The prices in the northern market stabilized yesterday because they had risen too much last week.</p>
<p>In the miscellaneous grain market, imports and exports were sporadic, and prices stagnated at last week's original prices. Jiujiang winter beans were priced at 15 million and 14 million yuan, selected green beans opened at 30 million yuan, with only six bags sold. Corn rose slightly by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, red beans were priced at 7 million yuan, mung beans had more transactions, and sesame seeds were not yet open.</p>
<p>Flour prices revolved upwards. The market was ordered to strictly prohibit silver dollar bidding. Merchants were wary and unwilling to let go easily. Therefore, yesterday's transactions were particularly scarce. Soldier ship initially opened at 7 million yuan, the central market rose to 7.5 million yuan, but it was still difficult to buy in. The later market rose again, with bids reaching as high as 8 million yuan. Old car opened at 8 million yuan in the morning, and by noon, the asking price was 8.5 million yuan, bran has not yet opened.</p>
<p>Edible oil stopped falling and rebounded. As rice prices remained firm, people's minds turned up. Retailers took advantage of the low prices to absorb, and the market showed less supply and more demand. Factory soybean oil and factory vegetable oil both opened at 95 million yuan, fresh rapeseed oil was at 72 million yuan, and small car sesame oil was at 75 million yuan. Soybean cake was still not open.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market was as stable as usual. As the authorities tightened their control over the market, people's hearts softened, and all parties lost interest. Although the rise and stop price tags in the market were still hung up, the general transaction was carried out outside the market. The morning market shouted as high as 250 million, 260 million, but there was no transaction after opening, and immediately fell. It was reported that Da De Cheng sold at 240 million, and the market fell slightly to 210 million, 240 million, and the lowest to 180 million, 210 million. The afternoon closed at 200 million, 230 million. There were few transactions in the afternoon.

<h3 id="e73">Cigarette Industry Association Calls on the Ministry, Please Withdraw the Order to Adjust the Tax Amount <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette Industry Association believes that the tax amount recently announced by the Goods Tax Bureau is too high and cannot be afforded. Yesterday, it specifically sent a telegram to the Minister of Finance and the Director of the National Taxation Bureau in Guangzhou. The original telegram stated: "Recently, the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau announced that the second phase of the cigarette tax in May will be implemented on May 6. The figure is about five or six times larger than the one announced and implemented in the first phase on May 1. It accounts for about 90% of the current market price of various cigarette brands. Recently, the cigarette industry has been promoting sales, and less than one-tenth of them can maintain production. The factory workers have been demanding payment, and the response to the environment has been increasing day by day. The factories are short of cash, and many of them use existing cigarettes to pay the workers. The actual market price has decreased from May 1 to May 5. This shows that the cigarette factory's business has become very state. Even if the tax amount is not adjusted, it is already extremely difficult, and it is already difficult to survive. After this adjustment, the average tax revenue of each cigarette brand accounts for more than 90% of the cigarette's market price. If the manufacturers want to purchase taxes and sell cigarettes, their income will only offset the taxes, which is equivalent to giving away cigarettes. It is no different from accelerating the collapse of the cigarette industry. In addition to presenting the case to the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, we sent a special express telegram, hoping that you will take into account the reality, and immediately inform the Shanghai Bureau to immediately restore the original tax amount of May 1. Please withdraw the order to adjust the tax amount every five days and settle the tax payment every three days, so that the cigarette industry can be slightly postponed."</p>

It is also learned that the municipal authorities and Taiwan are actively proceeding with the exchange of cloth for coal and grain, and it is estimated that approximately 70,000 tons of coal can be obtained each month.

<h3 id="e75">Scarce Silver Dollar Transactions: Prices of Various Versions Gradually Equalize; Nickel Coin Market Weak <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the silver dollar market showed signs of weakness. Due to the authorities' repeated emphasis on punishing those who violate regulations for disrupting the financial system, and after the execution of five silver dollar dealers on Saturday, many were discouraged from exchanging different versions. Half of the businesses stopped trading, while the other half quoted 3.8 million for buying and 4 million for selling. Eagle foreign dollars were available for purchase, but when asked about "small heads" (smaller denomination silver dollars), they replied that they were not being collected. The market price weakened further, and the situation improved in the afternoon. By evening, "small heads" and "junk dollars" were being sold by everyone at 4 million, and it is expected that the prices of various versions will equalize on their own.</p>
<p>Gold and silver exchanges maintained their style yesterday. There was a great deal of anxiety in the "big building" (referring to financial institutions), and no firm dared to exchange versions, but the price drop has already started to even out. In the morning, they were buying at 42 yuan and selling at 47 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to 43 and 48. Some even did as high as 45 and 50, but that was a minority. The afternoon was calm, still doing 43 and 48, and there was no distinction between factory bars and bank bars.</p>
<p>Gold-paper money exchanges and paper money-silver exchanges were completely suspended by general businesses yesterday. "Scalpers" operating in a guerrilla style in the corridors of the "big building" were still active. The gold (one tael)-paper money exchange was 50 yuan for buying and 52 yuan for selling. The paper money (ten yuan)-silver exchange was 8.5 yuan for buying and 9.5 yuan for selling, regardless of the version. Gold ornaments exchanged for silver dollars on the street were done at 43 and 47.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The nickel coin market was initially stable but then weakened. Due to the Garrison Command's order prohibiting the raising of silver dollar prices, people's confidence was weak, causing the market to remain at its original level. In the morning, 20-fen coins were bought at 160,000 and sold at 190,000. 10-fen coins were bought at 80,000 and sold at 100,000. 5-fen coins were bought at 30,000 and sold at 50,000. In the afternoon, 20-fen coins dropped to 140,000 and 180,000, 10-fen coins dropped to 70,000 and 90,000, and 5-fen coins dropped to 20,000 and 40,000, all down 20,000 from the previous day.</p>

<p>Cotton cloth trading in the market has returned to normal. Yesterday, quoted prices officially increased but actually decreased. The market was initially absorbed by the South China traders, but then weakened in the afternoon. It was said that there was a shortage of South China ships, making loading difficult. Traders then resold, causing a slight rebound. "Dragon Head" fine cloth rose from 16.8 million to 17.5 million, finally closing at 17 million. "Dragon Head B" fine cloth initially opened at 14.6 million. The highest price reached 16 million, but retreated to 15.4 million at noon.

"Three Peach" fine cloth was traded at 14.8 million, and "Four Gentlemen" serge reached a high of 18 million, finally closing at 17.4 million.

<p>The cotton yarn market was weak yesterday due to the low price of gold outside the circle, resulting in very weak buying interest. 42-count "Blue Phoenix" was traded at 820,000, a decrease of 80,000 from last week. 40-count "Golden City" was 760,000, also a decrease of 70,000. 32-count "Silver Moon" was 610,000, a slight decrease of 60,000. 21-count "Double Horse" single-ply had more supply than demand, resulting in weak interest.

<h3 id="e82">Brief News from Guiyang <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guiyang, 29th by Airmail] Recently, all industries in Guiyang have gradually adopted the silver dollar as the base currency. This Monday (the 25th), movie theaters changed the price of balcony seats from 5,000 gold yuan to 1.5 silver dollars, and the price of orchestra seats from 3,500 gold yuan to 1 silver dollar, charging in gold yuan converted at the current silver dollar price. A ticket that used to cost 5,000 yuan suddenly became more than 50,000 yuan, even more than 70,000 yuan. In movie entertainment venues where people living on salaries are the main audience, the business situation is naturally dismal. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, the Qunxin Cinema encountered a funny and yet depressing incident. The second show had already started more than a quarter of an hour ago, but only three balcony seats and four orchestra seats had been sold, all to soldiers and students. If a show were played for these seven people, the cinema would lose too much money, so they politely asked them to change their tickets to the next show, but these seven people firmly refused to change their tickets and insisted on watching the show immediately. The staff of the cinema politely expressed their willingness to refund the tickets, even offering to double the refund, but these seven people still firmly refused. Finally, the public relations manager of the cinema came forward to apologize, explained the difficulties, and invited them to a big meal at a nearby restaurant, doubling the refund for each of them, finally ending this farce caused by changing to silver dollar pricing that exceeded the people's ability to pay.</p>
<p>[Also Reported] The prices of newspaper publishing and advertising in Guiyang are so high that they are probably among the highest in major cities in the country. Before April 20, a full-size daily newspaper was priced at 1,600 gold yuan per copy, a quarter-size evening newspaper at 800 yuan, and advertising was priced at only 1,600 yuan per inch. On the 20th, all evening newspapers complied with the agreement of the Newspaper Association and changed to using the silver dollar as the base currency, with full-size daily newspapers priced at 1 silver dollar per copy, quarter-size evening newspapers at 5 cents, and advertising at 30 cents per inch, converted to gold yuan at the silver dollar price at 9 PM the day before publication. The price of a newspaper on the 19th was only 1,600 yuan, but the next day it suddenly jumped to 8,500 yuan. From then on, the silver dollar price rose every day, and the newspaper price also rose every day, reaching a maximum of 39,000 yuan per copy. Unfortunately, the newspaper vendors in Guiyang also have a bad practice of wholesaling at 60-70% of the list price and then reselling at 10-20% above the list price. In other words, in the past two days when the silver dollar price reached a peak of 490,000, people in Guiyang had to spend 60,000 gold yuan to buy a daily newspaper to read, which is shocking in a small border city where industry and commerce are not developed! In the past ten days, daily and evening newspapers have greatly felt the pain of "currency reform." Subscribers have been canceling subscriptions, retail sales have been decreasing day by day, and advertising has been almost entirely limited to weddings, engagements, and pleasure-seeking, with virtually no new customers coming in. The people in charge are always sighing and feeling that they are suffering the consequences of their own actions.</p>
<p>The Central Daily News, Guizhou Daily News, and Guizhou Commercial Daily News have recently been planning to automatically reduce the silver dollar base price of publishing under the pretext of "reducing the burden on readers" and are preparing to offer large discounts on advertising rates to overcome the difficulties. The Small Spring and Autumn, New World, and Mingdao Evening News have an even better idea: from May 1, they will change to a rotating publishing method, that is, doing the business of "working one day and eating for three days," changing from daily publishing to tri-daily publishing, thereby saving a lot of expenses. Each day, one evening newspaper will do the business of selling "exclusive" items, and each newspaper can also lay off many employees. The Youth News Evening Post boldly suspended publication for two days, standing on the "Yellow Crane Tower" to see how the others fared across the river before making a decision. They believe that not changing to silver dollars is impossible, and changing to silver dollars is still impossible. The only way out is probably to close down.</p>
<h3 id="e83">The Third World War is a "Political Germ Warfare" <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Xubai</p>
<p>Will the Third World War happen? If so, when will it happen? How will it happen? These are questions that everyone is concerned about today. Many opinions have been published by commentators at home and abroad, and I would like to add some opinions that have not yet been noticed.</p>
<p>To discuss the world war, we must first establish a definition for the term "war." Generally speaking, armed conflict is war. However, modern political struggles can achieve the effects of war without bloodshed. If the definition of war is limited to the former, I dare say that a world war initiated by the Soviet Union is not only unlikely to happen in ten or fifty years, but will never happen. If the definition of war is expanded to include the latter, then the Third World War has already begun before the end of the Second World War and is now actively expanding.</p>
<p>When I say a world war initiated by the Soviet Union, some may ask, "Is it certain that the future world war will be initiated by the Soviet Union?" I say this is inevitable because, judging from the current state of confrontation between socialism and capitalism, capitalist countries are clearly taking a defensive stance, aiming to secure their vested interests and maintain the status quo of their social order. Socialist countries, on the other hand, aim to achieve a world socialist revolution and are taking an offensive stance, naturally being the initiators of war. Assuming that we can determine that this proactive country will not adopt the form of war to attack, we can infer and determine that the future war of socialist revolution will never involve armed conflict.</p>
<p>Anyone who understands or has personally experienced the political tactics of communists knows that the Communist Party uses organizing the masses, grasping the masses, and using the masses as capital for their struggles. They are always the directors behind the scenes and never personally appear on stage. Their specialty is to disperse cadres among the masses, organize cells, and then use the power of many cells to dismantle the inherent organizations of society and rebuild their ideal new organizations. They have village cadres and township cadres to direct the performances on the stage of village and township congresses, and they have peasant cadres and worker cadres to manipulate the resolutions in the venues of peasant and worker organizations. They exclude or punish the current regime as well as landlords and capitalists, never exposing the political power they have gained to exert rigid oppression, but instead use democratic mass meetings for liquidation and struggle. This set of tricks is already familiar to the Chinese people today.</p>
<p>However, this set of political maneuvering tactics is not a secret unique to the CCP, but a fixed formula under the communist dogma for seizing political power. In every village and town in the CCP-occupied areas, we see the widespread application of this formula. In countries behind the communist Iron Curtain, such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, etc., there is not a single place that has not used this method to seize political power. Although the application of techniques varies somewhat from country to country due to differences in the environment, the basic method remains unchanged.</p>
<p>This infiltration tactic is political germ warfare. In the eyes of the Communist Party, its power is far greater than that of airplanes and artillery. They believe that this tactic can render atomic bombs useless because the germs they spread penetrate into every cell of a country's social organization. Who can distinguish which cell contains these germs? Even if they are identified, thousands upon thousands of cells mixed together make it impossible to find the object of destruction.</p>
<p>This tactic is fundamentally a political atomic bomb. Because the role of the atomic bomb is to shatter the organization of material cells, while this tactic is to shatter the organization of political cells. This is how communists think.</p>
<p>Therefore, they will never rely on airplanes, artillery, and atomic bombs, which they know they cannot match, to expand their political sphere of influence. Instead, they will try their best to use their political atomic bombs, which they are confident they have a firm grasp on, to achieve their social revolution. In other words, they will never engage in war with capitalist countries through armed conflict. Therefore, I say that wars of this nature will never happen.</p>
<p>Some may say, "Wasn't the Soviet Union one of the Allied countries in World War II, and one of the countries that suffered the most? They could participate in one war, so why not initiate another war?" This consideration is indeed meaningful because it can further infer the motivation of the Soviet Union's current military preparations.</p>
<p>When we study the course of World War II, seeing how the Soviet Union joined the Allied camp with hesitation and ambition, and how the results of the war revealed the heavy sacrifices it suffered due to the imperfection of various war conditions, we can understand that the Soviet Union cannot fight tough battles. Its communist rulers also know that it cannot shoulder the heavy burden of fighting. Its participation in the war was a last resort. If it had not stepped forward, the Nazi railways would have destroyed the podium from which the Third International issued orders, and the foundation of the social revolution would have been fundamentally eradicated. It had to take advantage of the ignorance of the capitalist countries and join their camp to preserve its existing political capital. It was forced to fight a tough battle, and fighting a tough battle would inevitably result in heavy sacrifices. The Communist Party knew this but could not avoid it, which is their unspeakable tragedy.</p>
<p>Today, the Soviet Union's lack of war preparedness is even greater than before its participation in World War II. This has already been repeatedly revealed by British and American reporters, and I need not elaborate further. I only wish to expose the errors in the final conclusions of some British and American reporters: they believe that the Soviet Union is now devoting itself to the expansion of military equipment, hoping to surpass the military strength of capitalist countries after the completion of the scheduled plan, and then fight a decisive battle with the United States and Britain on the battlefield. They do not know that the Soviet Union's military preparations, in military terms, are entirely defensive. In fact, its offensive has already begun. In the self-deceiving compromise and expectation of capitalist countries, it has broken through countless lines of defense and entered the heart of capitalist countries.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation to infer the future, it is not difficult for us to imagine the outline of the expansion of communist forces. The attack of germs must first target bodies with weak resistance. The communists have even more grasped the weakness of capitalist countries, that even the physically strong countries rely on the support of a large group of weak masses to maintain their health. If the communists can disintegrate this group of weaklings, the group of stronglings will lose its support, become weak, and become easy targets for germs. First disintegrate the weak and then the strong, and the task of the socialist revolution will be accomplished. Observing the changes in the Near East and the expansion of communist forces in the Far East, we dare say that this inference is correct. The fortresses of capitalism are the United States and Britain. Assuming that the colonies and dominions of the British Empire are first eroded by germs and collapse, the British Isles may be hard to preserve as the only remaining fruit. Assuming that the South American countries all become red and the Far Eastern market is covered by an Iron Curtain, it will be difficult for the United States to become a gold-dollar kingdom.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can assume that there will be no more international wars like the First and Second World Wars. Some countries will experience civil wars like China, and some countries will experience constant political turmoil. On the surface, it is a struggle between the left and right factions within each country, but in reality, the so-called left in each country has unity and a large military and political group directing from behind the scenes, while the so-called right is an unorganized and aimless mess.</p>
<p>Assuming that this inference is correct, and then looking at the recent measures of capitalist countries, such as the conclusion of the Atlantic Security Treaty, etc., which are actively defending in military terms, I am afraid that the leaders in the Kremlin are secretly laughing. They will laugh at these politicians who are setting up sentries on the front lines, and one day they will wake up to find that their old nest has been taken over by someone else.</p>
<p>The disease caused by the political germ warfare of the communists is an internal disease of cell disintegration, but capitalist countries want to cure this disease by adopting an external surgical operation, which is truly prescribing the wrong medicine for a desperate disease.</p>
<p>Internal diseases should be treated with internal medicine. If germs want to break your cells, you should strengthen your cells. If germs want to take advantage of your weakness, you should support your origins. The world is an interconnected economic system, and there is a life-and-death, common-fortune relationship between countries and nations. Therefore, we should be even more vigilant that the disintegration of the weak is the death knell for the strong. Helping the weak around the world who are susceptible to germs and making them strong is the only correct struggle policy to ensure that you will not be attacked by germs in the future. All the human and material resources that are currently actively preparing for war should be shifted to this aspect.</p>
<h3 id="e84">The Renowned Horses of Yanqi in Xinjiang: Silent Warriors <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Li Songze</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Dihua, 2nd (by airmail)] "Alfalfa follows the Heavenly Horses." In fact, the Yanqi horses of the ancient Western Regions were comparable to the Heavenly Horses. The Yanqi Uyghurs call it "Black City," but these "Silent Warriors" of "Black City" (as General Tao Zhiyue, Commander of the Xinjiang Provincial Garrison, called them) are still raised by the nomadic Mongols.</p>
<p>Originally, Xinjiang, including areas like Yili, Tacheng, Zhenxi, and Yanqi, were all horse-producing regions. If we compare them in terms of height, build, endurance, and ability to thrive on coarse feed, the horses from Yili and Yanqi are the best. Now that Yili is still a "special zone," Yanqi has become Xinjiang's only horse depot today.</p>
<p>Yanqi horses are not exclusively produced in Yanqi. Within the Yanqi administrative region, which includes eight counties—Yanqi, Heshuo, Hejing, Luntai, Weili, Ruoqiang, Qiemo, and Korla—horses are produced in all of them, but those from Yanqi, Heshuo, and Hejing are considered the best. East of the Qingshui River, south of the Kaidu River, extending to Bosten Lake, is Heshuo, which locals call "Heshuo horses" or "Heshuo families." Conversely, those extending into the Tianshan Mountains are "Hejing," which locals call "Hejing horses" or "Great Mountain horses." Yanqi County is situated in between geographically, essentially being divided, so the people of Yanqi don't call them "Yanqi horses."</p>
<p>Since "Yanqi horses" is a general term for those from Yanqi, Heshuo, and Hejing counties, their distribution is naturally on the lush grasslands in different corners of these three counties. Those on the plains are found in Quhui, the Qingshui River, the Taoniaojia River, Niaoshitala, Niaolachahan, the lower reaches of the Kaidu River, and near the shores of Bosten Lake. Those in the Tianshan Mountains are found in Halun Gully, Ala Gully, Baluntai, Eastern Tashkent, Nayurile, Shahatke, Cao Hanchacha, Kailigute, Niuchigeng Tashkhan, and the greater and lesser Yuludusi areas. The climate in the Tianshan Mountains is extremely cold in winter, and the grass withers, but in summer, the grass is lush and green, and the weather is exceptionally cool. The plains are very hot and have many mosquitoes in summer, but in winter, they are warm, and the water and grass can sustain nomads. Therefore, nomads distinguish between "summer camps" and "winter camps."</p>
<p>If we consider ourselves the "Boles" (expert horse judges) of today and differentiate them scientifically, Heshuo horses are inferior to Hejing horses, and among Hejing horses, the Great Mountain horses are inferior to those from outside the mountains. Compared to the commonly referred to Yanqi horses, they are even more inferior.</p>
<p>Generally, the body of a Yanqi horse is symmetrical in all its parts: the head is square, the ears are short, the nostrils are large, the lips are thin, the head is moderately long, the back is broad and long, the croup slopes gently, the chest and knees are broad, the fetlocks are relatively abundant, and there are very few club feet or hoof deformities. The posture is very handsome, and there are few mixed colors. The most common colors are yellow, black, black chestnut, red chestnut, and red date. The length and thickness of the hair are also moderate. The average height is above 136 centimeters. Their gait is mostly "lateral couplet," and "diagonal couplet" and "mili xi" together only account for half of all horses. Their temperament is more "blood type" than "lymphatic type," nervous temperament is "less than three percent," and their nature is gentle and their movements are agile. As for endurance, climbing ability, and the ability to thrive on coarse feed and withstand cold and exposure, horses from other places cannot compare.</p>
<p>Among the horse herds in the Hejing area of Yanqi, especially the Great Mountain horses, the overall quality is almost twice as good as that of horses produced in Hetou. The most obvious difference is that the coat color of Hetou horses is impure, and the hair is coarse, thick, and long, with a body length slightly lower by two or three centimeters. However, longevity, climbing ability, and the sturdiness of joints and hooves are unique characteristics of Hetou horses.</p>
<p>The ownership of these horse herds is mostly in the hands of the Mongols. For the Mongols, horses can be said to replace their legs. The Mongols' wealth, the horse herds, are the main part of the calculation, so it can also be said that horses are the Mongols' lifeline. We recall that Genghis Khan was able to dominate Eurasia and realize his so-called "I will make those who are now living in tents higher than all the nations of the world" ambitious words because of horses. Therefore, traditionally speaking, reasonably speaking, Mongol compatriots should cherish and improve horses. But what is the reality? The number of Yanqi horses is decreasing day by day. In 1939, the Soviet Union purchased over 30,000 of them at high prices in Yanqi. When Ma Zhongying withdrew from Xinjiang, he robbed over 4,000 horses in the Yanqi area. After the Yili Incident, about 20,000 horses grazing in the Tianshan Mountains were detained by the Yili side. As for the Yanqi horses purchased by local soldiers and civilians over the years, the number is even uncountable. The current combined estimate is only over 20,000, which is a very small proportion of the 900,000 horses in Xinjiang. Moreover, the number produced each year cannot even compensate for the number consumed each year. In another twenty or thirty years, even if they do not become extinct, the so-called renowned horses of Yanqi may only be in name. This is just looking at the quantity. In terms of quality, the Mongols cannot promote their traditional animal husbandry experience to improve breeds. On the contrary, they pay little attention to the selection of breeding partners, almost completely allowing horses to mate and reproduce freely, so their defects and losses are increasing. In addition, riding them before their teeth are fully developed, and innate deficiencies and acquired maladjustments, the body size is decreasing day by day. Ten years ago, the average height was 146 centimeters, now it is only about 136 centimeters. Plus, being left on the grasslands every day, year after year, some die of illness (mostly glanders and epidemics), some are ridden to death, some freeze to death, some die of heat, some drown, some fall to their death, some foals are bitten to death by wolves, and some foals are trampled to death by horses. All of these are due to the failure to prevent natural disasters, treat diseases, and acclimatize them to the environment, resulting in enormous losses, so both the quality and quantity of Yanqi horses are decreasing day by day. Although the Mongols have grown up on horseback, they know nothing about assisting horses other than secure riding. As for riding posture, there is even less to talk about. At the same time, they are not very particular about saddles and tack, which are all ragged and broken. In recent years, I have rarely seen them riding properly or riding a handsome, tall horse. Most are old, thin nags covered in mud and dung!</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to quote a few words from Zuo Shuping, the grandson of Zuo Zongtang and the administrative commissioner of the Yanqi District, as a concluding remark: "Yanqi is a world-renowned horse-producing place. I hope the people of Yanqi will be world-renowned horse lovers!"</p>

<p>Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi</p>
<p>[Mr. Huang Zihe asks:] (1) Regarding the gift of real estate to the eldest son and eldest grandson in the grandfather's written will, can it be considered separate property according to law? (2) If this separate property is sold or gifted away by the legal representative without the consent of the parties involved and not for the benefit of the children, can it be considered invalid? (3) Due to abuse by the stepmother, the child has early-stage tuberculosis, and the stepmother controls the family's finances and refuses treatment. In this situation, is it considered unreasonable to ask the family to allow the child to become independent and provide financial assistance?</p>
<p>[Answer:] (1) If the gift procedures are complete, it should comply with the provisions of Article 1087 of the Civil Code. (2) According to Article 1088 of the Civil Code, the legal representative shall not dispose of it unless it is for the benefit of the children. Any violation of this provision is of course invalid. (3) Medical treatment is a condition that meets "for the benefit of the children." The legal representative should make arrangements for payment, and the children can also designate separate property to request payment of medical expenses. However, it is not necessary to go as far as "requesting independence" and other irrelevant issues.</p>
