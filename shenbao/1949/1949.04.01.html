<h3>張治中等今晨飛平　先遣工作人員安抵故都　通郵通航代表同機到達</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕政府和平代表團秘書處人員及通郵·通航代表等一行十六人，由秘書長廬郁文率領，卅一日上午十時乘央航專機自京起飛赴平，空中歷時三小時，下午一時許抵達故都，專機當日自平飛經青島返滬。和談棄開啓在卽，首都人士對此先頭部隊之行蹤，亦一致寄以熱烈之希望。卅一日首都天氣和暖，晴空萬里，春光明媚，氣象祥和，專機係於卅一日晨七時半自滬載通郵代表飛京，而由李志雄·廬傳銘任正副駕駛，隨機並有電務員章馨然，空中小姐曹務荘負責沿途照料工作。該機共載重二二〇〇公斤，其中包括郵包九十五袋，重四〇三公斤，行李三十二件，五三二公斤，另銀元三箱，重一四一，餘為乘客體重。卅一日攜去之郵件為京·滬所有存留之華北郵件，郵務人員特鄭重說明此批信件得此良機帶去，使無數家人親朋獲得信息。其意義實至重大。卅一日赴平人員名單如次：秘書長廬郁文，顧問劉仲華，秘書張豐　·周光宇·張月超·楊公庶·陸錦堂·任寶華（包括譯電人員二名），通郵代表梅貽璠·翁灝英·李雄·王震百·沈鑫·通航代表雷仲仁·金山及幼童劉錦波共十六人。廬郁文氏在機塲宣布和代國之組織稱：全體人員共計廿三人，計代表六人，秘書長一人，顧問四人，秘書十人（其中包括事務二人，速記二人），譯電員二人。至其姓名不宣布之原因，在於避免增加平·京兩地各代表團人員親友之訪問與應酬而免減少其工作效率，並無其他意義。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕政府和平代表團六代表偕顧問秘書等一行，決定一日上午十時乘中國航空公司專機由京飛平。其準備工作，業已全部完竣。五代表中之國民黨篇委員張治中·邵力子·黃紹　·李蒸卅一日下午曾出席由李代總統召集之中政中常委談話會，聽取黨內同志之意見，並報告準備工作情形。八時李代總統設宴為全體代表餞行，邀請民青兩黨人士政院各部會首長及各地來京述職之軍政首長作陪。席間各別發言，交換意見甚多。至十時始散。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中國航空公司訊：政府和談代表張治中·邵力子等一行，將於今日乘該公司「天王」號專機飛平。專機定晨七時半自滬飛京，接載和談代表，十時自京明故宮機塲起飛，中途將降停青島加油，駕駛員正機師陳瑞鈿，副機師黃文斌，無線電報務員黃文智，空中小姐陳志威，吳民鼎兩人。該機平日飛行僅用空中小姐一人，此次鑒於各代表為國勤勞，特加派一人隨機照料。該公司前北平辦事處副處長吳福咸亦隨機赴平，擬洽談有關通航問題。按「天王」號飛機原係C—46型貸機，去秋經該公司技術員工利用全部當地材料，用人工改裝成客機，其中設備舒適完善，與「空中霸王」機近似。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕和平代表團顧問經卅一日政務會議通過，聘請劉仲華·屈武·李俊龍·于振瀛四氏出任；惟于氏以身體不適，恐不克赴平。</p>
<h3>通郵問題即商談　抵平後先與葉劍英接洽</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕全國全面通郵問題，卽將在北平開始商談。政府方面之通郵代表梅貽璠·翁灝英·李雄·王震百·沈鑫等五人，卅一日上午十時由京乘機飛平，將先訪中共所指派之通郵代表開始商談。梅等係於卅一日晨由滬乘央航專機飛抵京，會同政府和平代表團之秘書處人員同機飛平。如商談順利，梅等可能於二三週內先政府和平代表團南返覆命，俾便早日開始通郵。原擬同往之郵匯局代表蘇學仁，已決定中止赴平，故　等所商談者，純為通郵，將不涉及郵匯問題。據悉：通郵代表赴平之使命有二；一為研討全面通郵之技術問題，南北通郵早已局部實現，而主要者為上海·秦皇島間之輪運，但郵路除海運及一部份陸運外，尚有許多途徑可循，實行全面通郵時，則郵件將較今日實行者遠為迅捷，就目前所知，共方郵政尚係分區辦理，並無統一機構，實行全面通郵，在技術上諸待決定，通郵代表將通過北平市長葉劍英，與北平郵局人員商談後，再與其他各區聯繋，彼等並準備赴津一行。另一為保存郵政人事制度問題，數十年來郵政人事已建有良好系統，從事郵政者，恒終身以之，故員工生活安定，工作情緒亦佳，此良好制度希望能予以保留。在中共最近控制之各區，郵局人員雖未更變，郵政當局則希望中共能顧念郵政人事制度建立之不易，而予以保存，通郵代表將就此一問題與中共商洽，惟困難尚多，不能一蹴卽及。郵局代表梅貽璠登機前對記者表示，全面通郵問題可以樂觀，渠此行所致力者為技術問題。按梅氏原任山東郵政管理局局長，濟南淪陷，共方曾堅　其繼續供職，梅未允留濟，月餘始南返，共方對梅之清廉作風，極為欽佩，故此行當有成功之望。</p>
<h3>南北通航同時交涉</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕南北通航問題，將因和平代表團飛平再度同時交涉，央航·中航此次均派代表隨同前往，卅一日載秘書處人員飛平者為央航專機，央航派前曾一度赴平之雷仲仁同行，一日載和談代表飛平者，將為中航專機，中航亦派吳福咸同行，吳現在滬，定一日清晨隨專機來京後，再行飛平。此兩航空公司之代表，將在平與中共當局洽商，希望能有具體結果，俾使南北人民獲得往來之機會。據雷仲仁卅一日晨登機前語記者，通航問題，仍由代表團與共方交涉，航空公司代表將在技術方面予以協助，一旦談商有成，公司方面卽將準備復航。</p>
<h3>送行鏡頭　黎莉莉邵力子　特別為人注目</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕為和平代表第一架專機飛平人員送行之人士，有兩個人物特別為人所注目，一為影星黎莉莉，一為和平老人邵力子，黎着灰邊黑大衣，戴新型墨鏡，全副海派行頭，為金山送行，並與金山表演熱絡，金山並戲語黎，欲為黎帶青絲一根，致其在平之友人，在塲人士均大笑。邵力子到時，飛機引擎已發動，其夫人亦已離去，老人頻稱我的內人到那裏去了，旋夫人折回對邵氏稱：你看飛機已飛了，我向你招手，你都不看見，坐在汽車裏看報呢，言下不勝埋怨，邵氏笑答沒有關係，在旁之記者均大笑，旋邵氏卽偕夫人乘車而去。</p>
<h3>和談進行期中　立法院不休會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕立委卅一日舉行談話會結果，對若干立委建議在和談進行中立法院停會之意見，經多數反對，而已予以取消。該院卅一日上午曾召開兩組審查會，一組審查重行修正銀行業戰事存款放款清償標準，另一組審查調整公教人員待遇案，未有結論，到該院第三會期第十次大會，定一日晨九時舉行。</p>
<h3>中共通知政府代表團　和談將秘密進行　記者赴平問題尚待交涉</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕新聞記者要求隨和平代團赴平事，中外記者迭經向政院提出，均未獲得結果，卅一日再度向代表團秘書長廬郁文提出時，廬答以抵平後，決立卽向中共當局交涉接洽。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口卅一日電〕漢市報業公會為採訪和談消息，擬組武漢記者團赴平，刻正電請李代總統轉向中共徵求同意。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京卅一日電〕中共卅一日告政府和平代表團稱：北平之和談，將在極端秘密中進行，記者已無去北平之必要。據悉：李宗仁已訓令政府代表交涉此問題，定卅一日先行飛平之代表團秘書長廬郁文，已奉令於抵平時，首先與共黨交涉新聞報道問題。該官方人士稱：政府認為新聞報道問題為最重要者，共黨控制之電臺及報紙壟斷對發展所作之解釋，乃政府企圖避免的一危險。共黨之拒絕，僅在全體代表離京之前一日到達，故不可能使共黨改變其態度。</p>
<h3>何應欽飛穗</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州卅一日電〕確息：何應欽院長頃電此間政院，渠定二日自京飛穗，處理政院交代事宜。</p>
<h3>財政金融新改革案　政務會修正通過　分財政·幣制·進出口貿易三部　完成立法程序後即公布</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕財長劉攻蕓所擬之財政金融改革案，已於卅一日政務會議中修正通過，並卽送立法院審議，俟完成立法程序後公布施行。茲經記者探悉：該項改革案係因政院施政方針中有關財政金融部門，與前政院公布之財金改革案有應修正之處甚多，如因關元制度影響金圓券幣信，貨物稅繳納辦法等等均應予以增刪，特擬具修正財金改革案一份送政院。卅一日會中討論後，認為改革案精神原則均佳，惟細節方面則詳予討論及修正，費時甚久，計該案共分三大部份，茲誌略如次：</p>
<p>甲，財政部份</p>
<p>（一）本年內軍事必需費用及物資予以切實估計，而作籌劃·其估計之原則，在節餉及副秣費部份，均以銀元計算。（二）從速確定本年度施政方針編訂預算。（三）改訂財政收支系統，現所保留之田賦三成自卅八年糧食年度起歸還地方，原屬中央之土菸·土酒稅·特種營業稅劃歸地方，並放寬地方徵課稅捐之限制，使多數縣市能求自給自足。（四）卅八糧食年度起停止隨賦繳借糧食辦法，已借應還之本息展緩兩年償付。（五）海關進口稅以關元之計算。（六）徵課貨物稅之貨物，應以出產地附近市塲之批發價格為完稅價格之計算。（七）直接稅中之營利事業所得稅，儘量採取同業分攤辦法。（八）籌辦財產稅，使有錢者出錢。（九）創立「稅元」單位制，一切稅捐除關稅外，均以稅元計算繳納，每稅元一元合市制黃金一分，由納稅人以金圓券換購專充繳納稅捐之用，不在市面流通。</p>
<p>乙，金融幣制部份</p>
<p>（一）黃金白銀準許人民買賣，央行亦得為之。（二）銀元準許流通買賣，政府籌鑄銀元。（三）外國幣券仍禁止流通，央行收兌外幣，應照黃金市價及外匯移轉證價格計算。（四）金銀外幣不得攜帶出國，旅客攜金不得超過二市兩，銀不得超過二十市兩，外幣總値不得超過五百元。（五）金銀外幣入境者，除央行外，應有限制及徵進口稅。（六）酌辦生產貸款，優先給予民生日用品生產事業以購買原料及結匯之便利。（七）舉辦生活指數存款或其他保値存款。</p>
<p>丙，進出口貿易部份</p>
<p>（一）改善輸出入管理制度，（二）凡出口貨品所得之外匯及僑匯，均應全部交由央行或指定銀行，換取等値外匯移轉證。（三）央行應維持外匯移轉證之合理市價。（四）煙草·石油及石油產品之輸入，仍維持限額分配辦法，糧食·棉花·肥料之輸入，由政府另行規定辦法辦理。（五）凡由國外以自備外匯輸入貨品屬於前條規定，準許進口之品類得逕向海關報關轉運進口，其屬於限額分配及政府統籌辦理者，先報經輸出入管理機關核準。</p>

<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕行政院為保障人民不因物價上漲而受損失，卅一日例會中決定委託中央銀行辦理保値存款，包括金價存款，銀元價存款，美元價存款三種。此項辦法，係根據新任財政部長劉攻蕓所提「修正財政金融改革案」之規定而草擬，經卅一日院會修正通過，仍交劉氏負責整理後，再行公布實施。原辦法中曾擬有「米價存款」一種，會中討論後決予刪除，僅保留金價，銀元價，美元價存款三種。據悉：金價存款係依九九五成色之黃金市價計算，其存款證分一錢，五錢，一兩，五兩，十兩，五十兩，百兩七種。銀元價存款係依國父像銀元之市價計算，其存款證分一元，五元，十元，五十元，百元，五百元，千元七種。美元價存款係依外匯轉移證之市價計算，其存價分一元，五元，十元，五十元，百元，五百元，千元七種。各項存款分定期五日，十日，十五日，卅日，二個月，三個月，六個月，一年等八種，利息之有無或多寡，由中央銀行會同代辦銀行隨時隨地斟酌情形規定，但同地同日之同種證利率則應歸一致。存款證得由存戶決定記名與否，並得自由抵押或轉讓，到斯後並得在票據交換所交換。存款方法為存款人於存入之日，自由選擇其種類，依照當日市價，交付金圓券，存款到期，仍照原種類在原發證地方當日（請求付還本息日）市價以金圓券收回本息。所謂市價，午前係以當日上午開盤之市價為準，午後係以當日上午收盤之市價為準。其利息亦按存款種類計算（金價存款付金息，付還本息時照金價存款證票面加金息後，再按當日市價折算金圓券），此項存款，係由國庫以契約委託中央銀行，由中央銀行轉委託其他各國家行局庫辦理，各國家行局庫亦得再委託各公私金融業之公私行號分辦，存款人之存款由承辦之銀行負責，中央銀行對各銀行完全負責，國庫對中央銀行完全負責，各銀行承辦者除由國庫負擔其約定之手續外，並負其因物價上漲而存款所受之損失。此項辦法，將先自各主要都市辦起，逐漸推行各地。</p>

<h3>日本預算與美日關係</h3>
<p>日本吉田內閣與盟軍總部財政顧問道奇，現正進行一項重要會商，即討論一九四九—五〇年日本總預算的編製問題，以便提出眾議院通過實施。還是日本政府空前一件大預算案，說明了今後日本的政治動向，說明了美援的絕望，美國將用赤手空拳來管制日本。更說明了預算收支的不合理，連日本財閣都說不合理，勢將迫使吉田內閣的信用掃地，使現政權和民自黨的地位，日益萎縮不振。</p>
<p>民自學總裁吉田茂，今年一月廿三日眾院當選為內閣首相，組織了一黨壟斷的政府，這本是盟總一手支持成功的。吉田代表日本新的保守勢力，同財閱地主官僚緊密的結合，他這次重入內閣，自信甚強，他在許多措施表現方面，非常顯得他的勢力是不可輕狂侮的，他對在野的反對黨是如此，他對盟總的干涉態度也是如此。可是，他錯誤認識日本今天的地位和環境，他和盟總的關係，開始不愉快起來。這種不愉快的事實，最近更表現在一九四九—五〇年預算編製的問題上。盟總新任美國底特律銀行行長道奇為財政顧問，直接干涉吉田內閣的財政預算；盟總脅迫吉田內閣要編製一項大預算，并不許預算發生赤字，或期望美援來彌補赤字，是從所未有的態度。照盟總的意見，今後日本財政收支，要完全做到「自力更生」。所謂「自力更生」，就是要在無美援支持的情況下，忠實的執行盟總對日本指示的「經濟安定九原則」的執行。</p>
<p>日本一九四九年的會計年度，係從今年七月開始，因而總預算的編製必需於期前完成，并在四月的議會中通過成立，便交政府作為收付的標準。如果預算內容有問題，議會不予通過時，內閣即需在期前解體而重新組織，所以四五月間的日本，乃日本政治季節，政府黨與反對黨敵對高下的　衡量，就在這個政治季節之際。日本上年度的總預算為四千七百三十一億，人民的負担已沉重不堪，幾使蘆田內閣陷於崩潰；吉田今年競選時，力言減輕人民的負担，并要取消交易税，因而爭取得中小商業性地方的選民，壯大了民自黨的聲勢，從而取得議會第一黨的地位。關於一九四九年度預算的編製，藏相池田成彬最初預定為六十億，但幾次同道奇會商的結果，道奇均認六千億不足應付今後的收付，於是道奇嚴令日本政府編製預算必需注意：裁員減政，增加稅收，平衡收支，減低成本，不靠美援，自力更生。藏相池田根據此一指示，將預算修改為七千億，并要求這道奇維持民自黨的面子，將交易稅取消，但道奇不準。至於這個七千億大預算的提出，議會能否順利通過，道奇不鄧估計，反正一紙命令，民自黨最後仍需設法通過的。縱使吉田內閣改組或池田辭職，也是要預算通過的，否則盟總管制的威信，便有了問題。吉田池田對這件事甚感苦惱，認為盟總對於日本政治的干涉，現在更躍進了一步。三月廿三日東京「讀賣新聞」社論力促吉田內閣對財政及預算案，應與佔領軍當局反抗，這可以看出大預算案表現美日關係的微妙。</p>
<p>大預算案的內容說明了幾點：（一）美國在此後一年中，如無特殊需要，將不會在財政上援助日本；（二）盟總的「經濟安定九原則」，要日本政府忠實的執行；（三）盟軍佔領費上年為一千七百億，今年竟增加至二千五百億，恰佔全日本稅收百分之四十，這無異加重日本人民的負擔；（四）交易稅不取消，民自黨的信用掃地，所謂第一黨地位，將從本屆議會開會起，便要發生動搖，這無異鼓勵日本人民向左轉；（五）吉田內閣已決定四月一日開始普遍加稅，鐵道客票提高六成，郵電提高五成，糧食價格提高百分之十三·五，俟大預算成立以後，尚要繼續加稅。據新亞社東京電訊說，此項加稅對於國民日常生活影響殊大，非僅限於減低國民一般之購買力，幾致使國民難於維持其最低的生活。一句話說守，大預算之目的，是制造日本貧窮，加速吉田內閣的崩潰而已。</p>
<p>本來，吉田內閣已經成為弱體內閣，僥倖它在盟總的支持下，尚能維持生命。現在美國放棄對日的財政援助，要日本政府加重人民負擔，以維持其佔領，完全證明美國今後將以赤手空拳來管制日本。要之，美日關係是這樣的微妙，吉田內閣的沉疴，也祇有日益加深了。</p>
<h3>安慶穩固郊戰持續　渡至沙洲共軍後路切斷　和談開始前攻佔之計劃全部粉碎</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕安慶攻守職卅一日午前仍在城郊西起石門湖，經鳳凰山·龍王廟·五里墩·棋盤山·農業學校迄斷塘湖之幾激烈進行。來犯之共軍，其番號經查明者為陳賡之第十一·十二兩軍，皖西獨立旅曁土共三個團，共約四萬餘人。三十晚起，戰事尤以十一軍担任主攻五里墩以東之綫為最烈，棋盤山附近陣地且一度被突破，終賴國軍譚軍長之親臨督陣，卒將突入共軍一個營除生俘三四名外，其餘悉予殲滅。卅一晨起，空軍參加助戰後，情勢已趨平穩。又，陸續由山口鎮方面強渡偷渡至培文·上官·鐵心諸洲之共軍三千餘，經海軍增派艦艇後，三十日起，已將其後路全部封鎖，侷處各該沙洲共軍重返北岸已不可能，不難全殲。</p>
<p>〔本報蕪湖卅一日電〕陳賡原有限令所部於四月一日亦即和談開始前攻佔安慶之計劃，然此項計劃顯已因國軍之奮勇堵擊而全部粉碎。卅一日此間軍方與安慶方面聯絡時，守軍即以至愉快語謂相告：「國軍某勁旅又增援到達，安慶防務益臻鞏固，至縱陽鎮（貴池對江偏西北）橋頭促堡雖於卅日晚主動撤離，然此對江防戰局毫無影響，蓋濱江之河池口迄仍在國軍固守之中」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕安慶戰況無變化，其西冀華陽鎮廿八日失陷後，東翼桐城屬之沿江要地棕陽鎮於卅日夜失守，來攻者為陣毅部之第廿四軍及土共約二萬餘眾，守軍僅一營，激戰至卅日午夜十二時撤退至晨江江心鐵板洲上扼守。安慶東北楊家老壓共軍砲兵陣地二座，今午為空軍投彈炸毀。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕共軍對發動其江北橋頭堡之攻勢已愈趨積極，蘇皖方面陳毅所部，除不斷向華陽鎮·儀徽·八圩等橋頭陣地展開攻擊，其間華陽鎮且經自動放棄外，頃據報，原在泰縣之第廿七軍及另一番號（待查）共軍，俱已西調巢縣附近，有向蕪湖對江裕溪口及東西各橋頭陣地發動攻勢可能。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江卅一日電〕確息：卅一晨十時，儀徽共軍兩百餘人，突向城西黃家墳胥浦橋一帶猛攻，與守軍激戰三小時，不支後退，守軍正向前搜索中。</p>

<h3>常州古墓踏勘　（下）</h3>
<p>— 蔣大沂</p>
<p>墓磚飾紋</p>
<p>在常州由縣申報駐常記者李天行先生的好意，陪我們到了南鬥外靑龍橋的古基上去。可是因爲連天陰雨，基穴中全灌滿了水，不能進墓去看一個究竟，僅由李先生請當地小學裏的校長先生覓了一塊墓磚來，這塊墓磚的飾紋，和吾們看見的第一塊不同。它除了一面有飾紋以外，再有長的一邊和短的一邊的飾紋。邊上的飾紋是重疊的人字形；而面上的飾紋却是以三綫重疊的菱形紋配以斜綫爲座的大錢，在菱形紋與大錢之間，再塡上幾個十字紋。磚面上的圖案也是同第一塊一樣，由僅及磚面四分之一大小的一塊模型在磚面上連印四次而成，所以這塊磚上的四枚大錢也是一式的。可是錢紋上四個字，除了一個「五」字可識外，其他三個字都不可識，即使勉强去解釋了，也還是讀不通的。</p>
<p>假字之謎</p>
<p>後來，李先生又領吾們到正報館裏去，因爲那裏也藏有這座古墓的兩塊基磚。兩塊墓磚中的一塊，其飾紋是和吾們所見的第二塊一樣的。另外一塊却和吾們所見的第一塊大同小異：大同的地方，是磚面上也是焦葉紋配上四枚大錢的圖案，這幅圖案，也是由一塊模型連印四次而成小異的地方，是蕉葉紋是有「主脈」的，錢紋比較小，直徑止有四公分左右，而且錢紋上四個字，除左右兩個「五」字以外，上下兩字也不可辨識。</p>
<p>吾們在常州所見到兩塊墓磚的錢紋，爲什麼上邊的文字除了「五」字以外全不可識呢？吾想這或許是造磚的工師也有認識文字不很多的，他除了比較簡單的「五」字以外，隨便畫了幾個似是而非的「假字」在上邊，便就算了。這和造瓷器的工師，在瓷碗底上畫的圖章，往往圖章裏的文字全是似是而非的「假字」同樣的道理。可惜吾們在上海所見到那塊墓磚的型範，這回來始終沒有能見到，不能證明在上海所見到的那塊墓磚上的錢紋，是否是模糊的「大泉五百」呢？還是模糊的「假字」？不過便算在上海所見那塊墓磚上的錢紋不是「大泉五百」吧？那也只能說道古基的時代不一定在吳大帝嘉禾五年以後。至於說這墓的年代在三國前後的一個時期裏，那却還是對齣；吾們在上海和常州所見到的三塊基磚，依舊可以證明此說的不誤。</p>
<p>如何發掘</p>
<p>我們對這古基雖不能到裏邊去作詳細的觀察，但從巳顯露的部份看來，其規模實在並不算太大，既不是帝王的陵寢，也不一定是名公鉅卿的墳瑩，墓內劃分敎室，正也是漢魏六朝基的通常結構。而且據吾們的看法，這類古墓，絕大多數是巳被破壞過的。未被破壤的普通漢魏六朝墓，巳很少具有經濟價格的殉葬品；巳破壞過的，當然更不用說了。所以若然吾們抱了找寶貝的目標，去發掘這座古基，那一定是白賠工本，大失所望的。但是我們要知道墳素墓頭死人生活的情形，正是當時墳墓外邊活人生活狀態的反映，因爲吾們要追求當時活人生活的狀態而去淸理這座墳基，考察考察這墳裏頭死人生活的情形，那却是很有價値的工作。不過，要做這樣十的工作，一方面固然要監工的人非常精細地處理各種發現的遺物，非常精細地運用照相圖畫和文字將各種發現的遺跡充分紀錄下來；而一方面做工的工人也要非常的細心，否則便有將很好的材料糟掉之虞。所以這決不是發動民伕去掴，或請軍隊幫忙去掘所能解決的問題。在這兵荒馬亂的時候，要想把這個古墓的淸理工作做得很少遺憾，眞也是件不太容易的事，幸虧常州是學術文化永準很高的地方，我想當地對學術文化關心的諸位先生，一定能想一個好辦法來把這件事情辦妥的。</p>
<h3>皖南公路　慘澹經營中</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員董敏</p>
<p>「本報屯溪廿六日訊〕抗戰勝利後的皖南公路幹支綫段，至今夫能「復原」，建設經費預算始終不能與事實需要相配合，四年以來，都是苦撐經營。近數月來，安徽省因爲戰局關係扭轉了形勢，僅餘江南路段依舊勉强行車，據安徽省公路局皖南辦事處主任倪椿宣稱，目前情况，的如下述：</p>
<p>（一）大渡口（安慶對江）經東流縣到至德縣路段，自去年春季以來，即未通車。至德，石門街聞計劃路綫，尙未興築。石門街至浮梁（贛境）段，現况不明。</p>
<p>（二）東流至馬當棧，屬本省者僅六〇公里，久未行車，餘屬江西境路段。</p>
<p>（三）蕪（湖）屯，屯景（德鎭）（卽浮梁）二綫，卅六年八月起奉交部命令改爲京贛國道，由交總第一區局管轄，現已通車。</p>
<p>（四）繁（昌）銅（陵）靑（陽）段現在搶修，不久通車。</p>
<p>（五）靑（陽）岩（寺）段一六五公里，現有班車行駛。</p>
<p>（六）屯溪至街口，現有班車通行</p>
<p>（七）屯溪至昱嶺關屬杭徽國道，通車最久。</p>
<p>（八）京蕪綫屬京贛國道，現仍通車。</p>
<p>（九）宣（）城）涇（）縣）一段五〇公里支綫，尙未修築。</p>
<p>（十）宣廣（德）綫久未通車，眸情不悉。</p>
<p>（十一）宣南（陵）綫經抗戰期間破壞後，尙未條復。</p>
<p>杭屯公路客貨運輸，向以杭　汽車公司爲主，年來此路車運頻繁，第一運輸處爲發展業務，自三月廿二日起舉辦貨運，便利行商。</p>
<p>屯婺（源）公路，因土石方工程甚大，婺源久經災禍，農村凋敝，紛請從緩興工。夥（縣）漁（）亭）公路僅十四公里，亦爲地方無力筹資興建而擱淺。旌（德）績，績繁，繁涇三路段，方議開工，現又中止，經費無着，實爲一大主因。</p>
<p>服公過久的人，知道作官的苗頭是「王小二過年」，率性辭職跑單幫，到隣近貴陽不遠的外州小縣去收買豬油，猪肉，大米，美菸，到貴陽來一轉手間即可獲三四倍的利潤，要不然，那怕蹬在貴陽，專門爲人作「穿穿客」，代客買賣，從中取佣錢，雖然不免有失「面子」，也比公敎人員收入豐裕得多。抨有特殊勢力作背景，套用公款，侵佔公地，利用職權來從專房地產買賣，建築最豪華富麗的舞廳，茶廳，電影院，戲院的，最近在貴陽特別增加，這般人「雲頭駕得高」，更是無往而不大發洋財。</p>
<p>私人經營的企業，對於職員的待遇，早已另外使用別的幣制代替金圓券了，廣東街的花紗帮，對於跑街營業的是每月三十個大頭，主任之類的是五十個大頭，經副協理是八十，一百個大頭。新聞界除了中央社·中央日報。貴州日報還在擁護金圓券而外，七八家私人經營的日晚報，都是以其報紙每月訂價折合金圓券發給各從業員以若干份，有的是六七份，有的是十五六份，現價每份報紙每月訂價三千元，他們少則可得兩萬地獄，多者可得四五萬元，隨報紙價調整待遇，不折不扣·私立的中小學校，如天主堂的程萬中學是每一專任敎員每月三錢黃金，志道小學是五塊大頭，這些辦法，抗戰期間尙未想出做出，而今竟被認爲是最公道合理的，不知主持我國財政金融的局中人，看見有何感想。</p>
<p>筑市最近發生一椿牽連中央駐筑某軍事機關與新聞界某晚報女記者綁票敲詐案十，情節離奇複雜，牽連人數頗衆，正在一幕一揭開。起初是某軍車機關的上司有關人員夥同部屬經商，後來又由部屬邀約外間人參加，因爲分潤不均，某軍事機關的部屬遂將外間所參加進去的人架走到距筑市不遠的某倉庫內去藏匿勤贖，然後由市政府衛生局局長陳家琪出面斡旋，由外間人的家屬依照條件繳出黃金銀元而始獲自由。不料事機不密，竟爲某晚報女記者所知悉，該女記者遂往訪某軍事機關的上司，硬要採訪這倏新聞。講來講去，據熟悉內幕而又獲有證據的人說：結果以黃金十兩換得這條新聞不予公佈的「君子協定」。可是紙包不了火，這新聞仍爲新聞界齣人慢慢傳開了，且由中央日報某記者爲洗刷自身名譽而全盤刋出，刻市府衛生局陳局長已請假離筑，各報主嚴密淸查，正一步緊逼一步的在惡化發展。</p>

<h3>公用事業收款條件苛刻　廣大市民痛苦良深</h3>
<p>希市政當局返謀改善以利大衆</p>
<p>輯先生：鄙人家中用水，係由英商自來水公司所供給，本月份帳單係於廿三日晨收到，而付款期限爲本月廿五日。因水費係由數戶人家所分擔，收集需時，延至廿四日方始收齊。乃於廿五日下午前往繳付，因近日現鈔缺乏，且數目巨大，各戶所付者多屬支票。該公司收款員謂搭票不收，乃廢然而返。廿六日上午再往，不料至時竟謂該帳單已經逾期，須至三樓重行計價方可繳付。計算之後，增加竟達七成之巨，據云係按二二七九倍指數核算（原價係照一三三九·三六倍計算）本人因手邊無如此餘款，故又未能繳付，徒勞往返，且又被罰巨款，氣憤已極。查該公司收款時，對於支票多加無理留難，搭票不收，有何法律根據？且逾期罰款，並無事先通知（該公司帳單上只有「逾期不將全部帳款付淸，用水將停供」而並無過期不付，卽須照新指數繳付之通吿）。今該公司當局未得市公用局及市參議會之核准，何得以停供用水爲武器，任意增加市民之負擔。並聞電話公司亦有類似之情形。望將此項事實公諸報端，更希市參議會及市公用局加以注意，速將此剝削市民之虐政，予以制止，是盼！讀者唐昇上。</p>

<p>申報社會服務欄主編先生大鑒：昨閱貴欄登載陳君原函，謂蔽行收款不寄貨云云，無任惶愧！查通貨膨漲，郵途阻滯，外埠函購，貨款抵達之日，貨價與寄費，變易已多，以之作爲郵費，猶感不敷，此種困難，敝行向來分別情形，謹愼處理，陳君原函顯係不明實情，致起悮會，除已專函陳達外，敬希將敝函賜錄貴欄以釋羣疑，母任感荷。此請撰安</p>

<p>美鈔</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕美鈔塲外隨波逐流，晨開一萬七千五，一萬八千，低至一萬七千三，一萬七千八。銀行帮進出口搜求頗力，一路高至一萬八千三，一萬八千八，午收一萬八千，一萬八千五，午後更上層，開盤一萬八，一萬八千五，步漲至一萬九千三，一萬九千八。錢兌業稍有出籠，微退至一萬九千，一萬九千五收盤。較上日加起一千六百。隔日加息一千四百五，做高至二萬〇四百五，二萬〇九百五。</p>
<p>銀元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕馬路銀元益形俏俐，因工商業紛紛發薪，散戶競購熱烈，更以各帮套匯仍多，（一）本市出口商有大量套款，重慶·漢口套出約一百萬。（二）華南方面廣州·汕頭等地，各貿易商行，套出約四·五萬。因華南方面，金價報小，銀元價格仍堅，帮大宗套匯，均以銀元套做，匯水每百元僅八元，較金圓券匯六折，頗為合算。各方人心堅挺，執貨者鮮肯脫手。上午大頭自一萬三，一萬四，一路升至一萬五，一萬六。午後市況一度混亂，有求無供，高達一萬五千五，一萬六千五。傍晚市勢稍軟，大頭喊一萬五，一萬六，小頭喊一萬二千五，一萬三千五。鷹龍洋喊九千五，一萬〇五。支票交易旺盛，錢兌業對敲當日大頭初做一萬六，一萬七，一度高至一萬八，一萬九，最後一萬七，一萬八，較上日再跳二成左右。</p>
<h3>白粳門售叩十萬關　麺粉暴漲疾退　食油高峰盤旋</h3>
<p>米價昨日漲勢甚猛，因連日上漲速度較其他物價為遲緩，故貨主依然扳價甚力，南市塲初開略漲二三千，後以出戶稀少，價再挺升，白粳及早薄稻各漲六七千元，特粳價九萬五千，北市塲白粳九萬三千，及早薄稻均漲七千元，門售特粳已叩十萬大關，二市塲到貨共計六二七八石。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>價格，因銀根緊俏，欲漲不能，盤旋於高峰，開盤曾漲二三萬，後市以出戶多而下降，豆油收市五十二萬五千，生菜油四十七萬，各略昂五千至萬元，小車麻油及茶油均緊定，豆餅有的原價。</p>
<p>粉市</p>
<p>暴漲疾退，較前仍挺成餘，初市客帮猛吸，人心異常混亂，市勢激烈上升，老車中市高做三萬七千元，喊價曾達三萬七千五，兵船一度高喊三萬六千元，後市黃金報小，貨主逢高有吐，市勢急轉直下，老車做三萬六千八百元，兵船以三萬五千四百元最後成交。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>起落甚微，市勢進入盤旋，黃豆生仁平定，綠豆汕頭帮有吸，晉升五千元，芝麻供過於求，挫落萬餘元，紅糧微秀，苞米先堅後疲。</p>
<h3>市場散步</h3>
<p>— 看臺客</p>
<p>央行本票照樣貼水　要重寫財政貨幣學</p>
<p>行莊頭寸擺不平　自扳石自壓腳</p>
<p>昨天午後，銀元又開始狂跳。今後數天，還有一番熱鬧。</p>
<p>謝謝中央銀行，自得其樂，亂發本票，只說解疎現鈔荒，實際擴大本票頭寸，加重現鈔需要，刺激貼水增加。</p>
<p>中央銀行本票，名稱響亮，印刷比商業行莊漂亮，可是在市場，和一般搖搖翻的中小行莊的本票，一樣要照市八五折貼水。</p>
<p>為什么中央銀行要如此糟塌國家銀行的身份呢？</p>
<p>亂世多怪事，中央銀行怪事特別多。聽說洋商銀行取現很便當，有許多現鈔，從洋商銀行華買辦手裏，吐到貼水市場上。</p>
<p>又聽說商業行莊，每天可以向央取貼一百萬至二百萬元現鈔進出已久矣。這些現鈔，也轉旋送到貼水市場上。</p>
<p>中央銀行的現鈔，用處正多着哩！但是小百姓和職工們，是沒有半點份兒。</p>
<p>生活是大家困難的。軍警公教人員特別苦，銀元發薪是一句永久不能兌現的諾言。發些現鈔，讓他們賺些貼水，高興高興。</p>
<p>但是，小公務員小士兵們，那裏領到過現鈔。因為作為國用的這些現鈔，都有大捆大捆搬來搬去的特殊用途的。</p>
<p>諸如此類的作用，現鈔貼水的消滅，已經希望缺缺了。</p>
<p>理財如此理法，一切的財政學和銀行貨幣學，都要請當代要角重新寫過了。</p>
<p>局勢在等一等中，市面卻正是竄一竄的當口。</p>
<p>但是，昨天午後，許多行莊有擺不平的消息，不脛走遍全市，昨晚尚未稍減。還有若干客戶也有揹偃的傳說。人心不免要為之蹙額。</p>
<p>此時此日，行莊擺不穩，究是什麼理由？</p>
<p>人言之下，利息如此高，行莊應該生意好。豈知，利息收入，本來已非行莊近年來的生存之道。</p>
<p>目前行莊，生活在大矛盾之中。行行莊頭寸多，利息高就是利益好。中小行莊頭寸緊，利息重，也就負担重。</p>
<p>因為一般行莊，都是一面是債權人地位，歡迎高利貸。一面是債務人地位，很怕高利貸。行莊而像貿易公司或企業公司般做法的，又是普遍現象。平時，他們比貿易公司企業公司等舒服，因為調頭寸容易，拖進貨色　着挺着，毫無難色。但銀根趨緊時，他們就不如企業公司等寫意了。因為他們又要應付自己的債務，還要應付客戶的款項。二付担子一人挑，眞是吃力萬分了。</p>
<p>有許多事情，都是自扳石頭壓自己腳的。譬如最近行莊動動搖，為着一般客戶因為拿不到現現鈔，都懶於解款了。</p>
<p>過去，工商界收進頭寸，不論現鈔票據，大家解進銀行，寗使自己再打支票付款的。</p>
<p>自從現鈔稍緊，行莊們扣住現鈔，只付本票。就是解現鈔進去的，也只好拿本票。如此做法，害客戶們白白賠掉本票貼水損失，已使客戶不願再解款子。</p>
<p>再者，現在一切交易，都是票來票去。把收進來的大大小小的票子，過去解進銀行後開付一張支票，湊成貨價，付給對方。大家都在這樣收進付出，更沒有解銀行的必要</p>
<p>多數客戶，在交易上已沒有解銀行的必要及便利。於是一般行莊的收會量有的大減，有的不增，所增也不等於物價增漲的倍數。一看每日票據交換統計就可以知道。因此行莊的處境更難了。</p>
<h3>大鈔今日出籠　銀根可能看緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根較緊，晨開日拆每千元八十元，迄十一時許升至每千元一百元，午後回鬆至八十元左右，至三時左右，因各業需單甚殷，日拆挺升至一百元，後因庫款有流出，復回鬆至七十元光景，昨日行局計差出十五億，洋商銀行差進八億，大交換進十六億，小交換出九億，今日國行將發行五千及一萬元大鈔，預料將拋售物資，防止可能之漲風，銀根將看緊。</p>
<h3>貼放貿委開例會　通過貸款案三起</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會貿易顧問委員會昨日上午十一時舉行第十二次例會，陳長桐主席，通過貸款案件三起。又貼放會為舉辦生產事業定貨貸款，刻正籌設基本工礦，民生日用必需品，出口物資貸款審核小組，日內即可成立。又悉：該會定貨貸款，目前日開始接受申請後廠商前往該會領取申請書空白表格，為數頗多。</p>
<h3>茶市交稀價挺</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，買氣雖未盛熾，而賣戶心思不　，漫無標準之空喊，仍若雨後春筍，爭相怒茁，致市勢續趨交稀價挺，以迄午後，幸而業中銀根由鬆轉緊，漲風稍形緩和。</p>
<p>茲悉：茶葉零售價，自本月十六日加以調整後，邇因茶存空虛，同時茶價則跟一般物資，激烈踴騰，致與成本形成倒懸，爰於卽日起，進行變更，比前提升一擋。如龍井綠茶最高每斤原為三萬二千元，刻為四萬八千元，最低每斤原為一千六百元，遞增後為二千四百元，餘均依此類推。</p>
<h3>華股堅後飛升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股市勢，昨收市程先盤後堅，初開外埠匯款被壓，更因三底比期，市間銀根走勢呈俏，而指數發表，廠方籌款發薪，拋股搜單，市勢欲振不能。嗣因圈外物價俏稓，黃金市勢尤健，商業行莊部份匯款流出，頭寸供況較鬆，塲上買風展開，市勢急進，永紗晨開九元八角半，內外多頭翻空，挫至九元六角五。新空起補，又升至十元〇三角半，四角，嗣後紗帮來售，銀行帮頻納，市勢轉盤。近午銀根稍平，金價堅穩，　面激烈哄托，瞬息高升至十元〇五角午收。</p>

<p>午後因前市困於銀根，買氣遭阻，指數增值，人心頗昂，永紗首創十一元七角高價，卽登漲限。嗣後傳說拋金，多頭心怯，低至十一元一角，最後廣帮紗帮再起搜求，市況重俏，仍登漲限。塲外交易，初開十一元，步退至十元〇七角，終亦回升至十一元〇五角收市，全日成交五四億五千七一〇萬股。</p>
<p>外股市勢，昨日止跌轉漲，緣外匯證市況挺秀，黃金走勢堅升，各股一致飛揚。怡紗做二七〇〇〇元，二八〇〇〇元，又升三〇〇〇元。英聯三二〇〇〇元，三五〇〇〇元，升一〇〇〇元。業廣九〇〇〇元，九五〇〇元，亦俏一〇〇〇元。會德豐見十萬元，十萬〇五千元，疾升一五〇〇〇元。亞洲二八〇〇元，二九〇〇元。其餘各股均升成許。</p>

<h3>麺粉交換煙煤</h3>
<p>開灤礦務局在磋商中</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據有關各方面探悉：開灤礦務局為供應滬市煤斤需要，以此間麺粉三十萬袋運往華北，交換煙煤十萬公噸，其條件為麺粉三袋，交換煙煤一公噸，上項粉煙，均在華北秦皇島交貨。所有來回輪運，及運輸兵險，暨一部份船殼兵險等，及其他費用，均由供應麺粉方面負担。至換得之煙煤，於配售各公營事業時，仍照成本供售，并無利潤。近悉：華北方面徵收進出口稅，煙煤須徵收出口稅百分之卅，麺粉須徵收進口稅百分之十五，現正由該礦務局向有關方面磋商中，一俟解決，當再繼續洽訂麺粉交換煙煤合約云。</p>

<h3>棉紗後市挺升　布疋走勢尚平</h3>
<p>棉紗昨日市況先平後俏，晨初因銀根尚緊，買氣甚淡，塲上脫意較濃，嗣因生活指數發表，刺激人心，午收時一致高升。廿一支雙馬虹開三一六萬，開後納胃未見暢旺，市勢盤旋。嗣因黃金市況高升，更因指數增加，客幫起納，市勢卽升，午收高至三二五萬，升三〇萬，廿支金城三〇九萬，亦升二〇萬。十六支升十二萬，十支微升五萬元。</p>

<p>棉布因業中銀根奇緊，稍見回軟，唯同業心思殊佳，一致看俏，潛勢仍鞏固趨漲，客幫進出不多，散戶授受頻緊，供求相應，走勢則多以平盤開做，稍見喊高後，又復盤挫，臨收以金價回昂，再告回升。</p>
<p>龍細布以十三萬二千元開盤，先見十三萬五千元高價，紡建開售棉布，有龍頭B細布及大號龍頭細布多種，人心轉虛，暗息喊九十元，浮多頗有吐出，曾盤降至十二萬六千元，午收十三萬一千元，較上日軋低一五〇〇元。龍頭B細布軋小二千元，做十一萬六千元。大雙龍及花鳥細布做一〇七〇〇〇元，四君子嗶嘰晨開一〇九〇〇〇元，最高十一萬八千元，旋退至十萬零七千元，午收十一萬四千五百元，軋小二千元，色布稍見軋升。</p>

<h3>仁餘得分達新高峰　海青脆弱不堪一擊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕仁餘籃球隊昨夕七十二對三十四大勝海青新軍，再造四屆籃聯得分最高紀錄；亞軍地位，亦於場底定。</p>
<p>仁餘昨夕演出，并未臻理想，更因週六尚需與滬警交鋒，為保好實力計，主將俱未敢出全力週旋，且賽初卽蓄意粉刷第一週對海青時得六十九分之紀錄，重攻而不重守，故實力僅及甲二組水準之卻爾頓艦官兵，亦能投得三十四分。全部賽程，并不精彩，仁餘最擅長之烟幕。進攻亦因海青打出非驢非馬一攻卽破之區域聯防而未見施展。吳新運，姚文彝射籃俱未見順手，但得分仍達七十二，海青實力脆弱，由此可見。</p>
<p>仁餘孫國政染疾，蔡金典，莊逸榮未到，由吳新運，徐仲已，姚文彝，沈鵬舉，李肇和登塲。海青罰中佔先，仁餘小吳蛙式上籃，文彝角邊過頭擲入，仲已，鵬舉先後隻手揮中，轉瞬卽以十二對二拋出。海青心餘力絀，錯誤頻頻，籃下球盡為李肇和搶得。三十三對十三時，仁餘以陳渭源，晏彬登塲，使諸將輪番休息。上半時以三十八對十五遙遙前領。</p>
<p>下半時開始，仁餘以全力上陣，攻勢如火如荼，凈勝三十五分後。〔老大〕渭源又登塲表演，不旋踵卽以二　次中距離妙射為仁餘再添四分。海青則乘仁餘防守漸懈時全力反攻，得分不少，但姚文彝王槐庭不絕投桃報李，保持三十八分凈差。最後更加緊進攻，但求得分，終塲遂以七十二對三十四大勝。戰果如下：</p>

<p>下半時雙方人馬調動頗多，形勢亦甚接近，相差常祇二三隻球，平平夏李兩將與胖隊張少卿投擲得分不少，結果平平以五十二比四十七勝。</p>

<h3>安南網球冠亞軍　將在港作表演賽　溫蘇曾擊敗法台盃選手四人</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕定於四月二日四日五日在本港表演之安南網球名家溫蘇VAN　　SAU吳翁DUONG卅日已隨同安南巴黎網球會代表溫恩於下午二時，乘法國航機抵港，溫鳳為此行之領隊員，法國第六名高手都北，則經於四月三日方能趕到，現三人俱寄寓香港大酒店，據其領隊員語記者云，「溫蘇與翁，俱曾參加最近之全法網球錦標賽，成績甚佳，如果香港冠軍而能勝溫蘇之話，則當為一個不可多得之好手。」</p>
<p>又據該領隊之告語，則溫蘇在法，曾勝法國台盃代表如褒沙斯，布拉利，馬迪逋派利沙等，其成績為，用布拉利，六對三，八對六，勝馬逋，六對三，三對六，六對二，勝派拉沙，二對六，八對六，六對一，勝褒沙斯，二對六，五對七，七對五，六對四，六對二，又一九四五年時，溫蘇曾一度以二對六，六對三，六對〇，勝三日將趕來之本年全法第名好手都北。溫蘇此次在全法錦標賽，曾打入準決賽週，卒逢法國第一名手般納特，而後以六對四，六對二，七對五敗下，至於翁，則為東京冠軍，西貢亞軍，一九四七至四八年，曾在法參加三項賽會，遭逢全法第五名高手押爹沙林，亦能勝回一盤，而後以六對四，五對七，六對二敗下，其人賽時頭腦冷靜，亦殊易與之人云。</p>

<p>心裏想，嘴裏說，不及實實在在的做。拍乒乓的方法很多，要得到這些方法的路徑也很多：有的要用眼睛看來，有的要用耳朵聽到，也有的是要用腦去思想。但這些看到的，聽來的，想得的許多方法，都要從練習裏求實現。</p>
<p>怎樣的球如何擋？怎樣的球如何攻？削球要怎么拍？……心裹明白，沒有用處，一定要實在試過方有用。</p>
<p>事實上要練好一種拍法，絕不是一兩次就能學會的。就是學會了，還得要使之熟諳方才有用。要熟諳一定要練習，一定要多多的練習。并且愈練得多，才能應用自如，體會入微。所以要運動有興趣，要球藝有進步，非多多的練習不可。</p>
<p>一，練習與設備</p>
<p>乒乓的設備是球類中頂簡單，最輕而易舉的。要是隨便一點的說法，不論在什麼地方，把幾塊木板或是兩張檯子，都得玩一個暢快。但這是就隨便拍拍的說法，倘使自己能力夠得到，那麼設備方面頂好根據標準，作正式的練習。在將來的比賽上是很佔便利的。</p>
<p>乒乓室的佈置　現在我們先來談談標準乒乓室：標準乒乓室的容積：必須離檯面兩端各有十呎的空地，兩旁各有六呎的空地。自檯面至天花板有九呎以上的空間。連乒乓檯計算在內，乒乓室至少要：</p>
<p>長：二十九呎；</p>
<p>闊：十七呎八吋至十八呎；</p>
<p>高：十一呎六吋以上。</p>
<p>乒乓檯兩側的中間，離檯三英尺之後，分置裁判員的座位及紀錄席。</p>
<p>如要預備容納觀眾的話，那長與闊都得相當的擴大。并且最好在四週排有座位，座位的高低，照理是應該愈後的愈高，免得前排的人遮蔽後排人的視綫。</p>
<p>地上須鋪厚地板，并須保持清潔。</p>
<p>四周墻壁最好是白顏色。</p>
<p>乒乓室的光綫，須從兩旁射進，譬如檯子是南北放着的。那麼東和西兩方必得多開窗戶，使光綫充分的透進。要是檯子自東而西放着的，光綫須由南和北兩面充分透進。</p>
<p>練習乒乓很多是在晚上的。光的來源，完全要靠電燈。電燈的裝置須懸在乒乓檯兩頭的中央。距檯須稍高，免得妨礙拍球。燈炮外最好另加白磁罩，使光綫向四面平均放射。</p>
<p>對於光綫一層，往往很少有人注意，此事粗看似無多大關係，實際在練習上有背光或是耀眼的弊病，減少興趣，同時影響球藝進步。在比賽上就要使成績不正確。所以這是應該注意的。</p>
<p>標準的乒乓檯　乒乓室的不合標準，使拍球的能力不能充分發揮，乒乓檯的合不合標準，所受的影響更是重大　的。平日練習的乒乓檯合乎標準，到比賽時和在練習時可以一樣的隨心如意。平日練習的乒乓檯倘使是隨便湊成功的，那麼在比賽時勢必難於捉摸，而給對方以可乘之隙，自己受重大的壓迫。</p>
<p>依照世界現行的乒乓規則，標準乒乓檯應當安置如水平，并須合於下列的規定：（甲）長度：二·七四三公尺（卽九英尺）；（乙）闊度：一·五二四公尺（卽五英尺）；（丙）高度：〇·七六二公尺（卽自地面到檯面為二英尺六寸）；（丁）檯面必須平滑，不限用何種材料製成，但須能使離檯面〇·五公分（一尺）高處落下之乒乓球，彈起二〇·三公分（八寸）至二二·九公分（九寸）高者為合宜。（戊）檯面及檯腳全部，應塗成不反光之墨綠色。（己）檯面四週沿邊應該漆闊一·九公分（四分之三寸）白色邊綫。（庚）檯腳之裝置至少離檯端及檯側各二〇公分（四寸）。</p>
<p>乒乓檯兩側直邊綫的中央與兩兩端的橫綫并行是張着乒乓網。這個網須具備下列的條件：（甲）網高一五·二公分（六寸）；（乙）網長：一·八二九公尺（六尺）；（丙）網須白色，網眼各四分之三寸；（丁）網的上端，加縫四分之三寸闊的淡棕色邊；（戊）兩旁須密緊於乒乓柱，下端須接於檯面；（己）務使緊張而平直。</p>
<p>乒乓柱裝置在檯之兩側中間檯邊，伸出檯面一五·二公分（六寸），柱頂高出檯面一五·二公分（六寸），與檯成直角。</p>

<h3>說謊無節</h3>
<p>— 徐卓之</p>
<p>西洋人的花樣，在中國什麼都行得通；只有愚人節，是永遠行不通的。</p>
<p>爲什麼呢？因爲中國的老百姓，數千年來都是在受愚受騙，蒙在鼓裏。既然一年三百六十五日都在受愚，那末　　必多此一舉，特定一天爲愚人節呢？</p>
<p>西洋的這個節日，在中國譯爲「愚人節」，這「愚一字實在是太雅致了一點，令人不易懂，其實不妨直截了當地譯爲「騙人節」，或「說謊節」也可。說謊爲什麼要有節呢？因爲人家平時不大說謊，不許說謊，而說謊却又是人性底裏的一種潛在欲望，所以特定這一天，大家說個痛快，也是給這種情緒一個官洩。至於我們呢？騙人是正當，說謊是常事，老百姓那一天不在被騙，受愚？今天把兩圓金圓券換進你一塊銀洋，明天又作七千圓賣還給你，憑空賺你三千五百倍！</p>
<p>聖人不是早說過麼：「將欲智而兵欲愚」。爲什麼將要智呢？因爲可以扣軍餉，吃空額；爲什麼兵要愚呢？因爲可以使他們三個人分五百金圓券而仍忍氣吞聲。推而廣之，自然是官欲智而民欲愚，則種種欺民騙民，也不過是軍行聖人之敎罷了。</p>
<p>在一個大家都說說，都騙人的地方，要不說謊是很難的，如果人人都指鹿爲馬，指黑爲白，如果你一個人說出這是鹿，這是黑，那就不但要被人嗤笑，而且說不定還會有殺身之禍。中國的政治，數千年來向以說謊騙民爲惟一的法則；而老百姓自己呢，也就以互相詐欺作爲立身處世的根本。在這種情形下，說謊既是常事，那末，再要把說謊另定一個固定的節日，就未免太多事了。</p>
<p>愚人節是不會在中國行得通的。有一天行得通時，倒是中國人民之福了。</p>
<h3>劣政碑</h3>
<p>— 蕭几石</p>
<p>唐時柳公權，何進滔皆有「德政碑」。</p>
<p>晋代扶風王駿有德政，西土爲之樹碑，見者無不下并。此二者俱不失「德政碑」的意議。</p>
<p>但觀乎官家多「虛偽」，拍馬者衆，恐怕有很多是使親信部屬，勾結劣紳，虛構「德政」，樹立「政碑」的。</p>
<p>所以，白居易詠青石詩，有：「不願作官家道傍德政碑，不鐫實錄鐫虛辭」。不但是諷刺入骨，亦屬寫實也。</p>
<p>據廿八日本報載：「川崇慶縣長業春杰，頃因案調職，縣人爲紀念其任內貪汚剝削種種之劣蹟，特公贈劣政碑，豎立縣境，以誌去思。砰聯爲：早去數目夫有眼，晚走幾日地無皮。橫額云：永留奥名」。寫來直截爽快，所謂「晚走幾天地無皮」，官吏之搜刮，各處皆然，天下鳥鴉一般黑，固不獨崇慶縣長一人也。</p>
<p>世事多艱，遍地「搜刮」，我們眞欽仰崇慶縣民衆的大胆，「直言談相」。但中國之大，恐頃藍田山的靑石，也不能盡刻「劣政碑」吧？</p>
<h3>愚人</h3>
<p>— 張契渠</p>
<p>你記得嗎？今天—四月一日—是愚人節呀！留神，別上了人家齣當罷！</p>
<p>愚人習俗，原係傳自西方，呌做April-gool，或稱萬愚節。中國在戰前，已有人「西學爲用」了。那時在北平，有一家報紙上刊載着一段小新聞，說胡適博士於昨夜得急病逝世了。當天，胡適的親友學生都大爲震驚，紛紛趕往胡寓吊唁，及至看到胡適安坐家中依然無恙，方知受愚。可是受愚者雖然懊麥，却總比見「眞的死了」高興得多，因此此就一笑了之。</p>
<p>次年，南京某報封面上，刊有一則名畫家徐悲鴻與蔣碧薇結婚啓事。他二人原是老夫老妻，早在法國時便結了婚的，如何現在又結婚了呢？原來那一陣子他倆口子正有些小糾紛，大有小事化爲大事的可能，因此有人故意給他們開道玩笑，作爲愚人也可，作爲諷刺也可，而當事人和糾紛中的關係人，因爲事出於愚人節，也就無法追究了。</p>
<p>去年愚人節，上海也相當熱鬧。其中最惹人注意的，有畫家劉獅與影星歐陽莎菲的自殺消息。前者因爲是劉獅的至友徐心芹報道的消息，後者則更有照片爲證，所以上當的人很多。</p>
<p>西習，在這一天雖任何人都可以撒一下誰，但必須在對方受愚之後，或正要受愚之際，立即說破是Aprin，以免鑄成大錯。道是愚人應有的道德。</p>
<p>愚人的材料，也有審愼選擇的必要。如像上述這類謠言，雖然害人一時，却也無傷大雅。但若逕指有功國家的人爲罪犯，或誣稱造福人民的英雄爲匪類，雖在愚人節，即不受法律制裁，也未免有傷忠厚。</p>
<p>其次，在最緊張的當兒，也開不得玩笑。倘使今天有人造謠說：「江北共軍全面渡江，和談因此擱淺」，這玩笑就不僅開得太大，而且也太缺德了、</p>
<p>這是說愚人者應該注意之點。至於被愚者，雖然不免有些憤憤，却也不必因此對於這一天中所有事事物物都存懷疑之心。例如今天假使有消息說「吳國楨已調任外交部長」，那也許是」愚人」；但，若是他今天去杭州也懷疑是假的，那就未免過敏了。</p>
<p>以此類推，譬如說在北平舉行的和平談判，雙方所提條件，固未必全無「愚人」成份在內；但若代表們都因今天適逢愚人節而大家存着「你別在那裏愚人吧？」之心，那可不容易談攏了。所以，愚人者應有愚人的道德，被愚者亦須有容人的雅量，方不致成爲眞正的愚人。</p>
<h3>不說謊是變態</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>假使有人問你：你說謊嗎？」你一定會否定地回答說一不」。其實，生平沒有說過一句謊話的人，是最少數中的最少數。有人曾作過一個統計，證明有百分之九十七的人都說過謊話的，其中大多數是偶爾爲之，也有少數則習以爲常。</p>
<p>耶魯大學有兩位敎授，曾於說謊一事，作詳細的研究。他們費了四年時間，調查了一萬一千人，發現說謊的次數，和智力成反比例；愈聰明的人，說謊的次數愈少；可是，即使是智力最高的人，也還是免不了要說點謊的。</p>
<p>既然說謊是大多數人所有的行爲，當然就是一種正常的現象，；相反地，不說謊反成爲是變態的徵狀了。可是社會上，還是推祟變態的」誠實」，而鄙視常態的「說謊」。因此，一般人仍是不肯承認這種例外的常態行爲，反而要指說謊是變態，實在是心理上的矛盾。</p>
<p>大家都曉得誠實是美德，但偏偏要說謊，豈不是奇怪嗎？其實，人爲了適應環境，本不得不有些矯揉做作。最普通齣，在很大的塲合，和客氣的人說話，總得要敷衍幾句，遦其中就有不眞實的話了。雖然這種話是無關宏旨的，但謊話總是謊話。適應環境，不就是正常的行爲嗎？</p>
<p>在法庭上，犯人的說話，總不能完全眞實的。法官雖用種種方法，來審詢犯人，但也難獲得完全的眞情。犯罪是不名譽的行爲，說謊也是不正當的，他避重就輕地選擇了說謊，目的是解脫或减輕他的罪證。這是求活命，求生存，當然也是正常的心理表現。</p>
<p>醫生看了一個很嚴重的病人，對病人總要隱瞞幾分，不肯將眞正的情形，吿訴病人自己，怕病人聽了以後，因恐懼憂盧而反加重病勢。醫生對病人說的話，當然有幾句謊話的，在這種情形下說謊，更不能說是不對；仁慈和同情，也是正常心理上應有的現象呀。</p>
<p>上面講的，是故意的說謊。也有在自己不知不覺中，說了謊的。尤其是一件突然發生的事，因爲注意未能集中，往往滲入了猜度之詞。有人曾把汽車闖事的影片，放映給許多人看，看完以後，要他們回答幾個問題。結果，幾乎大家都把影片上的事情有點弄錯，祇是錯的程度有高下而已。二十個問題全都答對的，沒有一人。所以目擊者的話，也常有謊話的，不過是無意的罷了。</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhizhong and Others Fly to Peiping This Morning; Advance Personnel Arrive Safely in the Old Capital; Postal and Aviation Representatives Arrive on the Same Flight</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] A group of sixteen people, including personnel from the secretariat of the government's peace delegation and representatives for postal and aviation services, led by Secretary-General Lu Yuwen, took a Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) special plane from Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 31st and flew to Peiping. After a three-hour flight, they arrived in the old capital at around 1:00 PM. The special plane flew from Peiping to Qingdao and then returned to Shanghai on the same day. As the peace talks are about to begin, the people of the capital are unanimously placing high hopes on the movements of this advance team. The weather in the capital on the 31st was warm and sunny, with a clear sky and bright spring sunshine, creating a peaceful atmosphere. The special plane took off from Shanghai at 7:30 AM on the 31st, carrying the postal representatives to Nanjing. Li Zhixiong and Lu Chuanming served as the chief and co-pilots, respectively. Also on board were communications officer Zhang Xinran and flight attendant Cao Wuzhuang, who were responsible for providing care along the way. The plane carried a total weight of 2,200 kilograms, including 95 bags of mail weighing 403 kilograms, 32 pieces of luggage weighing 532 kilograms, three boxes of silver dollars weighing 141 kilograms, and the remaining weight being the passengers. The mail carried on the 31st consisted of North China mail that had been stored in Nanjing and Shanghai. Postal workers emphasized that this batch of letters was being taken on this opportune flight, allowing countless family members and friends to receive information, which was of great significance. The list of personnel who went to Peiping on the 31st is as follows: Secretary-General Lu Yuwen, Advisor Liu Zhonghua, Secretaries Zhang Feng, Zhou Guangyu, Zhang Yuechao, Yang Gongshu, Lu Jintang, Ren Baohua (including two decoding personnel), Postal Representatives Mei Yifan, Weng Haoying, Li Xiong, Wang Zhenbai, Shen Xin, Aviation Representatives Lei Zhongren, Jin Shan, and young Liu Jinbo, totaling sixteen people. At the airport, Lu Yuwen announced the organization of the peace delegation, stating that the total number of personnel was 23, including six representatives, one secretary-general, four advisors, and ten secretaries (including two administrative staff and two stenographers), and two decoding personnel. The reason for not announcing the names was to avoid increasing visits and social engagements from relatives and friends of the delegation members in Peiping and Nanjing, thereby reducing their work efficiency, and there was no other significance to it.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The six representatives of the government's peace delegation, along with advisors and secretaries, have decided to take a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) special plane from Nanjing to Peiping at 10:00 AM on the 1st. Preparations have been fully completed. Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Huang Shaohong, and Li Zheng, the Kuomintang members among the five representatives, attended a discussion meeting convened by Acting President Li on the afternoon of the 31st with members of the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee, listened to the opinions of party comrades, and reported on the preparations. At 8:00 PM, Acting President Li hosted a banquet to bid farewell to all the representatives, inviting people from the Minqing two parties, heads of various departments and commissions of the Executive Yuan, and military and political leaders from various regions who came to Nanjing to report on their work to accompany them. During the banquet, everyone spoke and exchanged many opinions. It only ended at 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>[This newspaper report] According to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC): the government peace talk representatives Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi and others will fly to Peiping today on the company's "Tianwang" special plane. The special plane is scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Beijing at 7:30 am to pick up the peace talk representatives. At 10:00 am, it will take off from Beijing Ming Palace Airport and land in Qingdao to refuel. The pilots are pilot Chen Ruidian, co-pilot Huang Wenbin, radio operator Huang Wenzhi, and flight attendants Chen Zhiwei and Wu Minding. Usually only one flight attendant is assigned to this aircraft, but this time, in view of the representatives' hard work for the country, an extra person has been assigned to take care of them. Wu Fuxian, the former deputy director of the company's Peiping office, will also travel to Peiping to discuss relevant aviation issues. The "Tianwang" aircraft was originally a C-46 cargo plane, which was converted into a passenger plane by the company's technical staff using all local materials last autumn. The equipment is comfortable and perfect, similar to the "Air Overlord" aircraft.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The advisors to the peace delegation, Liu Zhonghua, Qu Wu, Li Junlong, and Yu Zhenying, were appointed through a political conference on the 31st; however, Yu will not be able to go to Peiping due to health issues.</p>
<h3>Postal Issues to be Discussed Immediately; Contact with Ye Jianying Upon Arrival in Peiping</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The issue of nationwide postal service is about to be discussed in Peiping. The government's postal representatives Mei Yifan, Weng Haoying, Li Xiong, Wang Zhenbai, and Shen Xin took a plane from Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 31st and will first visit the postal representatives designated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to begin discussions. Mei and others arrived in Nanjing by CATC special plane from Shanghai on the morning of the 31st and flew to Peiping on the same plane as the secretariat personnel of the government's peace delegation. If the discussions go smoothly, Mei and others may return south to report within two or three weeks before the government's peace delegation, so that postal services can be started as soon as possible. Su Xueren, the representative of the Postal Remittance Bureau who was originally scheduled to go with them, has decided to cancel his trip to Peiping. Therefore, what they are discussing is purely postal services and will not involve postal remittance issues. It is reported that the postal representatives have two missions in Peiping: one is to study the technical issues of nationwide postal service. North-South postal service has already been partially realized, mainly through shipping between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao. However, in addition to maritime transport and some land transport, there are still many routes that can be followed. When nationwide postal service is implemented, mail will be much faster than it is today. As far as is known, the CCP's postal service is still run on a regional basis and there is no unified organization. The implementation of nationwide postal service requires technical decisions. The postal representatives will contact Peiping Mayor Ye Jianying and Peiping Post Office personnel, and then contact other regions. They are also preparing to visit Tianjin. The other mission is to preserve the postal personnel system. For decades, the postal personnel system has been well-established. Those who engage in postal services do so for life, so employees have stable lives and good work morale. It is hoped that this good system can be preserved. Although the postal personnel in the areas recently controlled by the CCP have not been changed, the postal authorities hope that the CCP can take into account the difficulty of establishing the postal personnel system and preserve it. The postal representatives will negotiate with the CCP on this issue, but there are many difficulties and it cannot be achieved overnight. Before boarding the plane, postal representative Mei Yifan told reporters that the nationwide postal service issue can be viewed with optimism and that his trip will focus on technical issues. Mei was originally the director of the Shandong Postal Administration Bureau. When Jinan fell, the CCP firmly insisted that he continue to serve. Mei refused to stay in Jinan and returned south after more than a month. The CCP greatly admired Mei's integrity, so this trip should be successful.</p>
<h3>North-South Air Services Negotiated Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The issue of North-South air services will be negotiated again simultaneously due to the peace delegation's flight to Peiping. CATC and CNAC have both sent representatives to accompany them. The CATC special plane that carried the secretariat personnel to Peiping on the 31st was accompanied by Lei Zhongren, who had previously been to Peiping. The CNAC special plane that will carry the peace delegation to Peiping on the 1st will be accompanied by Wu Fuxian, who is currently in Shanghai and will come to Nanjing on the morning of the 1st with the special plane before flying to Peiping. The representatives of these two airlines will negotiate with the CCP authorities in Peiping, hoping to achieve concrete results, so that the people of the North and South can have the opportunity to travel to and from. According to Lei Zhongren's statement to reporters before boarding the plane on the morning of the 31st, the issue of air services will still be negotiated by the delegation and the CCP, and the airline representatives will provide assistance in technical aspects. Once negotiations are successful, the company will prepare to resume flights.</p>
<h3>Scenes of Farewell: Li Lili and Shao Lizi Particularly Noteworthy</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Among the people who bid farewell to the personnel on the first special plane to Peiping for the peace delegation, two figures were particularly noteworthy: film star Li Lili and the veteran peacemaker Shao Lizi. Li was wearing a gray-edged black coat and new-style sunglasses, fully dressed in Shanghai style, to see off Jin Shan. She interacted warmly with Jin Shan, and Jin Shan jokingly said to Li that he wanted to bring a strand of her hair to his friend in Peiping, which made everyone laugh. When Shao Lizi arrived, the plane's engine had already started, and his wife had already left. The old man frequently asked, "Where has my wife gone?" His wife then returned and said to Shao, "Look, the plane has already flown, I waved to you, but you didn't see me, you were sitting in the car reading the newspaper," with a hint of complaint. Shao replied with a smile, "It doesn't matter," which made the reporters laugh. Shao then left with his wife by car.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Will Not Adjourn During the Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] As a result of the discussions held by the Legislative Yuan on the 31st, the opinions of some legislators who suggested that the Legislative Yuan suspend its sessions during the peace talks were opposed by a majority and have been canceled. The Legislative Yuan convened two review meetings on the morning of the 31st. One group reviewed the revised standards for the clearing of wartime deposits and loans in the banking industry, and the other group reviewed the proposal to adjust the salaries of civil servants and teachers, but no conclusions were reached. The tenth session of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 1st.</p>
<h3>The CCP Notifies the Government Delegation That the Peace Talks Will Be Conducted in Secret; The Issue of Journalists Going to Peiping Still Needs to Be Negotiated</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The issue of news reporters requesting to accompany the peace delegation to Peiping has been repeatedly raised by Chinese and foreign journalists to the Executive Yuan, but no results have been obtained. When Lu Yuwen, the secretary-general of the delegation, was asked about it again on the 31st, he replied that he would immediately negotiate with the CCP authorities upon arrival in Peiping.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Hankou, 31st] The Wuhan Newspaper Association plans to organize a Wuhan reporter delegation to Peiping to cover the peace talks and is currently telegraphing Acting President Li to seek the CCP's consent.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 31st] The CCP told the government peace delegation on the 31st that the peace talks in Peiping will be conducted in extreme secrecy and that there is no need for reporters to go to Peiping. It is reported that Li Zongren has instructed the government representatives to negotiate this issue. Lu Yuwen, the secretary-general of the delegation who will fly to Peiping first on the 31st, has been ordered to first negotiate the issue of news coverage with the Communist Party upon arrival in Peiping. The official said: "The government believes that the issue of news coverage is the most important, and the Communist Party's control of radio stations and newspapers monopolizes the interpretation of developments, which is a danger that the government is trying to avoid." The Communist Party's rejection only arrived the day before the entire delegation left Beijing, so it was not possible to change the Communist Party's attitude.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Flies to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 31st] Confirmed information: Premier He Yingqin recently telegraphed the Executive Yuan here, stating that he will fly to Guangzhou from Nanjing on the 2nd to handle the handover matters of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>New Financial and Monetary Reform Plan Revised and Passed by the Political Council; Divided into Three Parts: Finance, Monetary System, and Import and Export Trade; to be Announced After Completion of the Legislative Process</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The financial and monetary reform plan drafted by Finance Minister Liu Gongyun was revised and passed at the Political Council meeting on the 31st and will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval before being announced and implemented. According to reporters' inquiries, the reform plan is due to the fact that the Executive Yuan's policy guidelines regarding the financial and monetary sectors and the previously announced financial and monetary reform plan have many aspects that need to be revised, such as the impact of the customs gold unit system on the credibility of the Gold Yuan currency, and the method of paying commodity taxes, etc., all of which need to be added or deleted. Therefore, a revised financial and monetary reform plan was drafted and sent to the Executive Yuan. After discussion at the meeting on the 31st, it was believed that the spirit and principles of the reform plan were good, but the details were discussed and revised in detail, which took a long time. The plan is divided into three major parts, which are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>A. Financial Part</p>
<p>(1) Strictly estimate the necessary military expenditures and supplies for this year and make plans. The principle of the estimation is that the allowance and subsidiary feed expenses are calculated in silver dollars. (2) Quickly determine the policy direction for this year and prepare a budget. (3) Revise the financial revenue and expenditure system. The 30% of the land tax that is currently retained will be returned to the local government from the 38th grain year. The local tobacco and alcohol tax and special business tax that originally belonged to the central government will be assigned to the local government, and the restrictions on local taxation will be relaxed so that most counties and cities can seek self-sufficiency. (4) Starting from the 38th grain year, the method of borrowing grain along with the tax will be stopped, and the principal and interest that have been borrowed and should be repaid will be deferred for two years. (5) Customs import duties are calculated in customs gold units. (6) The goods subject to commodity tax should be calculated based on the wholesale price of the market near the place of production as the taxable price. (7) The profit-seeking enterprise income tax in direct taxes should be allocated among the same industry as much as possible. (8) Prepare for property tax so that those who have money can pay. (9) Create a "tax unit" system. All taxes, except customs duties, are calculated and paid in tax units. Each tax unit is one yuan, equivalent to one cent of gold in the market system, and taxpayers can purchase it with Gold Yuan coupons specifically for paying taxes, and it will not be circulated in the market.</p>
<p>B. Financial and Monetary Part</p>
<p>(1) People are allowed to buy and sell gold and silver, and the Central Bank may also do so. (2) Silver dollars are allowed to circulate and be bought and sold, and the government is preparing to mint silver dollars. (3) Foreign currency notes are still prohibited from circulating. The Central Bank should calculate the exchange of foreign currency based on the market price of gold and the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. (4) Gold, silver, and foreign currency are not allowed to be taken out of the country. Travelers are allowed to carry no more than two market ounces of gold, no more than twenty market ounces of silver, and the total value of foreign currency must not exceed 500 yuan. (5) Those who import gold, silver, and foreign currency, except for the Central Bank, should be subject to restrictions and import taxes. (6) Provide production loans as appropriate, giving priority to the production of daily necessities for the convenience of purchasing raw materials and settling foreign exchange. (7) Organize cost of living index deposits or other value-guaranteed deposits.</p>
<p>C. Import and Export Trade Part</p>
<p>(1) Improve the import and export management system. (2) All foreign exchange and overseas remittances obtained from exported goods should be handed over to the Central Bank or designated bank in full in exchange for foreign exchange transfer certificates of equal value. (3) The Central Bank should maintain a reasonable market price for foreign exchange transfer certificates. (4) The import of tobacco, oil, and petroleum products will continue to maintain the quota allocation method, and the import of food, cotton, and fertilizer will be handled by the government according to other regulations. (5) For those who import goods from abroad with self-provided foreign exchange that fall under the categories permitted to be imported in the previous article, they may directly declare to the customs for import and transit. Those that are subject to quota allocation and government unified management should first be approved by the import and export management agency.</p>
<h3>Fu Bingchang is About to Return to China</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] He Yingqin telegraphed Fu Bingchang again on the 31st, urging him to return to China immediately to take up his new post as Foreign Minister. It is also learned that Fu had telegraphed that he would return to China via Europe.</p>

<h3>Government Entrusts Central Bank to Handle Value-Guaranteed Deposits; Three Types of Deposits: Gold Price, Silver Dollar Price, US Dollar Price; Protects People from Losses Due to Price Increases</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] In order to protect the people from losses due to rising prices, the Executive Yuan decided at its regular meeting on the 31st to entrust the Central Bank to handle value-guaranteed deposits, including three types: gold price deposits, silver dollar price deposits, and US dollar price deposits. This method was drafted based on the provisions of the "Revised Financial and Monetary Reform Plan" proposed by the new Minister of Finance, Liu Gongyun, and was revised and passed by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 31st, and will be handed over to Liu for responsibility of organizing before being announced and implemented. The original method had proposed a "rice price deposit," which was deleted after discussion at the meeting, and only gold price, silver dollar price, and US dollar price deposits were retained. It is reported that gold price deposits are calculated based on the market price of 99.5% purity gold, and the deposit certificates are divided into seven types: 1 qian, 5 qian, 1 liang, 5 liang, 10 liang, 50 liang, and 100 liang. Silver dollar price deposits are calculated based on the market price of the Sun Yat-sen silver dollar, and the deposit certificates are divided into seven types: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, 100 yuan, 500 yuan, and 1000 yuan. US dollar price deposits are calculated based on the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, and the deposit values are divided into seven types: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, 100 yuan, 500 yuan, and 1000 yuan. The various deposits are divided into eight types with fixed terms of 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 30 days, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Whether or not there is interest, or how much, is determined by the Central Bank in conjunction with the agent banks, depending on the situation, but the same type of certificate rate on the same day in the same place should be consistent. The depositor may decide whether or not to register the deposit certificate, and may freely mortgage or transfer it, and may also exchange it at the clearing house after maturity. The deposit method is that the depositor freely chooses the type of deposit on the day of deposit, and pays the Gold Yuan coupon according to the market price on that day. When the deposit matures, the principal and interest will still be collected in Gold Yuan coupons at the market price on the day (the date of requesting repayment of principal and interest) in the original place where the certificate was issued. The so-called market price refers to the market price at the opening of the market in the morning, and the market price at the closing of the market in the afternoon. The interest is also calculated according to the type of deposit (gold price deposits pay gold interest. When repaying the principal and interest, the gold interest is added to the face value of the gold price deposit certificate, and then converted into Gold Yuan coupons at the market price on that day). This deposit is entrusted by the national treasury to the Central Bank by contract, and the Central Bank entrusts it to other national banks and treasury to handle, and the national banks and treasury may also entrust the public and private banks and firms of the public and private financial industry to handle it. The deposit of the depositor is the responsibility of the handling bank, the Central Bank is fully responsible to each bank, and the national treasury is fully responsible to the Central Bank. In addition to the agreed handling fees borne by the national treasury, the banks that undertake the business are also responsible for the losses caused by price increases. This method will be implemented first in major cities and gradually promoted to various places.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's Budget and US-Japan Relations</h3>
<p>The Yoshida Cabinet of Japan and Dodge, the financial advisor to the Allied General Headquarters, are currently engaged in an important consultation, namely discussing the compilation of the 1949-50 Japanese general budget, so that it can be submitted to the House of Representatives for approval and implementation. This is an unprecedented large budget for the Japanese government, which illustrates the future political trends in Japan, the hopelessness of American aid, and the fact that the United States will use its bare hands to control Japan. It also illustrates the unreasonableness of the budget's revenue and expenditure, which even the Japanese financial circles say is unreasonable, and will inevitably discredit the Yoshida Cabinet and increasingly weaken the position of the current regime and the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>Shigeru Yoshida, the president of the Liberal Party, was elected as the Prime Minister by the House of Representatives on January 23 this year, and organized a one-party dominated government, which was entirely supported by the Allied General Headquarters. Yoshida represents Japan's new conservative forces, closely linked with financial groups, landlords, and bureaucrats. This time he re-entered the cabinet with great confidence, and in many measures he demonstrated that his power should not be taken lightly. This was the case for the opposition parties in the opposition, and also for the Allied General Headquarters' interventionist attitude. However, he mistakenly recognized Japan's current position and environment, and his relationship with the Allied General Headquarters began to become unpleasant. This unpleasant fact has recently been further manifested in the issue of compiling the 1949-50 budget. Dodge, the new American head of the Detroit Bank and financial advisor to the Allied General Headquarters, directly interfered with the Yoshida Cabinet's financial budget. The Allied General Headquarters coerced the Yoshida Cabinet to compile a large budget and did not allow the budget to have a deficit, or expect American aid to make up for the deficit, which was an unprecedented attitude. According to the Allied General Headquarters' opinion, Japan's financial revenue and expenditure in the future must completely achieve "self-reliance." The so-called "self-reliance" means faithfully implementing the "Nine Principles of Economic Stabilization" instructed by the Allied General Headquarters to Japan without the support of American aid.</p>
<p>Japan's 1949 fiscal year begins in July this year, so the compilation of the general budget must be completed before the deadline, and passed by the parliament in April, so that it can be handed over to the government as a standard for revenue and expenditure. If there are problems with the budget content, and the parliament does not approve it, the cabinet will need to dissolve and reorganize before the deadline. Therefore, April and May are Japan's political season, and the height of the government party's and opposition parties' antagonism is measured during this political season. Japan's total budget for the previous year was 473.1 billion, and the people's burden was already unbearably heavy, almost causing the Ashida Cabinet to collapse. When Yoshida ran for election this year, he strongly advocated reducing the people's burden and abolishing the transaction tax, thereby winning over voters in small and medium-sized commercial areas, strengthening the power of the Liberal Party, and thus obtaining the position of the largest party in the parliament. Regarding the compilation of the 1949 budget, Finance Minister Ikeda initially planned for 60 billion, but after several consultations with Dodge, Dodge believed that 600 billion was not enough to cope with future revenue and expenditure. Therefore, Dodge strictly ordered the Japanese government to pay attention to the following when compiling the budget: reduce staff and government spending, increase tax revenue, balance revenue and expenditure, reduce costs, not rely on American aid, and be self-reliant. Based on this instruction, Finance Minister Ikeda revised the budget to 700 billion, and requested Dodge to maintain the face of the Liberal Party and abolish the transaction tax, but Dodge did not allow it. As for whether the parliament can smoothly pass the proposal of this 700 billion large budget, Dodge did not estimate it. In any case, with a single order, the Liberal Party will still need to find a way to pass it in the end. Even if the Yoshida Cabinet is reorganized or Ikeda resigns, the budget must be passed, otherwise the credibility of the Allied General Headquarters' control will be questioned. Yoshida and Ikeda are very distressed about this matter, believing that the Allied General Headquarters' interference in Japanese politics has now taken a step further. The Tokyo "Yomiuri Shimbun" editorial on March 23 strongly urged the Yoshida Cabinet to resist the occupying authorities on financial and budget matters, which shows the subtle relationship between the United States and Japan as expressed in the large budget proposal.</p>
<p>The content of the large budget proposal illustrates several points: (1) The United States will not provide financial assistance to Japan in the coming year unless there is a special need; (2) The Allied General Headquarters' "Nine Principles of Economic Stabilization" require the Japanese government to faithfully implement them; (3) The Allied Forces' occupation expenses last year were 170 billion, but this year they have increased to 250 billion, accounting for 40% of Japan's total tax revenue, which is tantamount to increasing the burden on the Japanese people; (4) If the transaction tax is not abolished, the Liberal Party's credibility will be discredited, and the so-called position as the largest party will begin to waver from the opening of this parliament, which is tantamount to encouraging the Japanese people to turn to the left; (5) The Yoshida Cabinet has decided to generally increase taxes starting on April 1, with railway passenger tickets increasing by 60%, postal and telecommunications increasing by 50%, and food prices increasing by 13.5%. After the large budget is established, taxes will continue to be increased. According to a New Asia News Agency Tokyo dispatch, this tax increase will have a significant impact on the daily lives of the people, not only reducing the general purchasing power of the people, but almost making it difficult for the people to maintain their minimum living standards. In a word, the purpose of the large budget is to create poverty in Japan and accelerate the collapse of the Yoshida Cabinet.</p>
<p>Originally, the Yoshida Cabinet had already become a weak cabinet, and it was fortunate that it could maintain its life with the support of the Allied General Headquarters. Now that the United States has abandoned financial assistance to Japan and wants the Japanese government to increase the burden on the people in order to maintain its occupation, it completely proves that the United States will use its bare hands to control Japan in the future. In short, the relationship between the United States and Japan is so subtle, and the chronic illness of the Yoshida Cabinet will only deepen.</p>
<h3>Anqing Is Solid, Suburban Warfare Continues, Communist Army Cut Off by Crossing to Sandbars, Plan to Capture Before Peace Talks Begins Completely Shattered</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] The Anqing offensive and defensive battles are still ongoing fiercely in the suburbs of the city on the 31st, from Shimen Lake in the west, via Fenghuang Mountain, Dragon King Temple, Wulidun, Qipan Mountain, Agricultural School to Duantang Lake. The invading Communist army, whose numbers have been verified, are Chen Geng's 11th and 12th armies, the Western Anhui Independent Brigade, and three local Communist regiments, totaling about 40,000 people. Starting on the 30th evening, the fighting was particularly fierce on the line east of Wulidun, which was mainly attacked by the 11th Army. The positions near Qipan Mountain were once broken through, but thanks to the personal supervision of General Tan, the National Army commander, the Communist army battalion that broke in was annihilated, except for three or four prisoners of war. Starting on the morning of the 31st, after the air force participated in the battle, the situation has become stable. In addition, more than 3,000 Communist troops who successively crossed or sneaked across from Shankou Town to the Peiwen, Shangguan, and Tiexin sandbars have had their rear routes completely blocked since the 30th after the navy dispatched additional ships. It is impossible for the Communist troops trapped in the sandbars to return to the north bank, and it is not difficult to annihilate them all.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Wuhu, 31st dispatch] Chen Geng originally limited his troops to capture Anqing before April 1, which is the beginning of the peace talks, but this plan has obviously been completely shattered due to the National Army's courageous blocking. When the military here contacted Anqing on the 31st, the defending army happily told them: "A strong National Army force has arrived to reinforce, and the defense of Anqing is becoming more and more solid. Although the Qiaotou Fort in Zongyang Town (northwest of Guichi across the river) was actively evacuated on the evening of the 30th, this has no impact on the overall river defense situation, because the Hechikou River Port on the riverside is still firmly held by the National Army."</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] There is no change in the Anqing battle situation. After Huayang Town on the western border was lost on the 28th, Zongyang Town, an important riverside area belonging to Tongcheng on the eastern wing, was lost on the night of the 30th. The attackers were the 24th Army of Chen Yi's army and about 20,000 local Communists. The defending army was only one battalion, and after a fierce battle, they retreated to Tiebanzhou in the center of the Chenjiang River at 12:00 midnight on the 30th to hold it. Two Communist artillery positions in Yangjia Lao Ya northeast of Anqing were destroyed by air force bombing this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] The Communist army is becoming more and more active in launching its offensive on the Jiangbei bridgehead. Chen Yi's army in the Jiangsu and Anhui area is constantly launching attacks on the Huayang Town, Yi Hui, and Ba Wei bridgehead positions. In addition to the automatic abandonment of Huayang Town, it has been reported that the 27th Army, originally stationed in Taixian County, and another Communist army with an unknown number, have been transferred west to the vicinity of Chaoxian County, and may launch an offensive on Yuxikou, across the river from Wuhu, and the bridgehead positions to the east and west.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 31st dispatch] Confirmed news: At 10:00 am on the 31st, more than 200 Communist troops from Yi Hui suddenly launched a fierce attack on the Huangjiafen Xupuqiao area west of the city. After a three-hour fierce battle with the defending army, they retreated. The defending army is searching forward.</p>
<h3>Central China Situation Is Getting More Serious, Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen's Troops Arrive in Xiangfan, With Intent to Launch Large-Scale Offensive on Yisha</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xinyang, 31st dispatch] Confirmed military news from Queshan: The two armies of Nie Rongzhen's army, which arrived between Xuchang and Suhe, have mostly moved southwest along the west side of the Pinghan Line. Their vanguard division advanced rapidly southwest to the Xiangfan area beyond Nanyang on the 30th. The Communist army's arrow is pointed directly at Shashi and Yichang.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xinyang, 31st dispatch] According to the military's judgment here: The Communist army in eastern Hubei may launch a key attack at the same time after Nie Rongzhen's army, which is going south on the west side of Shangping Han, has completed its assembly outside Sha(shi) and Yi(chang). Unless the peace talks are successful, this large-scale offensive will not be delayed until after April.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 31st dispatch] It is reported that about three armies of Lin Biao's army invaded south in the area west of the Shangpinghan Line in the latter half of this month. Most of their vanguard troops have arrived in Nanyang, and a part has arrived in the Xiangfan area. It seems that they intend to launch a large-scale offensive on Yisha. Yisha is the lifeline of our upstream river defense. We have made strong deployments. If the Communist army invades south, a major decisive battle will inevitably be staged in the Yisha area.</p>
<h3>National Army in Central Hubei Recaptures Yunmeng</h3>
<p>Communist Army in Zhumadian Has Retreated North, Southern Section of Pinghan Line Resumes Traffic</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xinyang, 31st dispatch] The Communist army that was defeated and retreated from the Wangjiadian Station on the Pinghan Line returned to the vicinity of Xi'anlu on the railway on the evening of the 30th. The Communist army that fled to Anlu County has not yet withdrawn. It is confirmed by the military today that Yunmeng County was indeed recaptured by General Zhang's army corps on the 29th. In addition, after the National Army recaptured Hanchuan County, the situation in the Xiang River turned stable.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xinyang, 30th dispatch] The Communist army that fled into the Zhumadian area left quietly to the north on the evening of the 30th after completing the task of covering the movement of Nie Rongzhen's army southwest to Wuyang. The National Army originally stationed in the area was ordered to return to defense today. The Railway Bureau has scheduled to resume the No. 72 mixed train between Hankou and Zhumadian on the 1st.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 31st dispatch] The Jianghan Column of the Communist army, which invaded the vicinity of Wangjiadian on the southern section of the Pinghan Line, fled to the Anlu area. The town is still standing strong. The bus from Han to Xin (yang) has been operating normally since the morning of the 31st.</p>
<h3>Commander of the Central Plains Communist Army Changes, Liu Bocheng Replaced by Peng Dehuai</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 31st dispatch] At the reception of the Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense on the 31st, Director Deng confirmed the news that Peng Dehuai will replace Liu Bocheng to command the Central Plains Communist Army.</p>
<h3>The Words and Deeds of the Chinese Communists Are Very Inconsistent, Fighting While Negotiating! The Statement That the Communist Army Has Retreat From the Front Line Is Completely Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] Regarding the issue of both sides issuing cease-fire orders after the start of the peace talks, Director Deng Wenyi said when answering questions from reporters on the 31st: Since peace talks are being held, a cease-fire should be implemented first. However, the rumor that the Communist army has retreated 30 li from the front line has been proven inaccurate by the fact that they are still launching offensives against Anqing.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] The Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense published the "Weekly Battle Situation" from March 24 to March 30 on the 31st, stating: "There have been no battles in Guanzhong, Taiyuan, and other places in the past week. The Communist army in Jiangbei has launched its offensive on the Jiangbei bridgehead. The Communist army in Central China is gradually moving east. The National Army is firmly defending its positions and strengthening its river defense." It then described in detail the battle situation on the Yangtze River (omitted), and finally stated: "Looking at the Communist army's military actions along the Yangtze River north bank and in various parts of Central China, they are inconsistent with the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's sincerity in seeking peace. The Communist Party has announced the representatives, date, and location of the peace talks on the one hand, and mobilized a large army to actively attack Anqing on the other hand. Their words and deeds are very inconsistent. In addition to firmly defending the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, the National Army sincerely hopes that the Communist army can also stop fighting and rest as soon as possible, restrain each other, implement a cease-fire first, and jointly promote peace."</p>
<h3>Three Air Force Planes Defect</h3>

<h3>Official-Business Collusion and Major Corruption, Airport Cannot Be Used After Repair, Protagonist, Director of Wuhan Station of Civil Aviation Bureau, Has Fled</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 31st dispatch] Amid the disruption of Yangtze River shipping and the stagnation of air transport between Shanghai and Hankou, the Xujiapeng Airport in Wuchang, which has been under construction for several months and is said to have been completed, suffered damage to its runway immediately after the Civil Aviation Team's aircraft test landed at the airport, and most of it cannot be used. All parties expressed surprise. After many investigations, it was discovered that Zhang Weigao, the director of the Wuhan Station of the Civil Aviation Bureau who was in charge of repairing the airport, colluded with unscrupulous contractors to embezzle project funds. The Civil Aviation Authority allocated a total of 3.8 million yuan in gold to repair the airport in January of this year, which was equivalent to more than 70,000 silver dollars at the time. Zhang Weigao initially paid 2.8 million yuan in gold for the project, embezzling 950,000 yuan in gold. He then changed the engineering contract under the instigation of the contractor, using existing materials, cutting corners, and forcibly conscripting civilian workers under the guise of military use, saving more than 1.6 million yuan in project funds, totaling more than 50,000 silver dollars. However, the matter was exposed due to the test flight results, and Zhang Weigao fled in fear of punishment on the 28th. All parties have protested and expressed anger, and in addition to reporting to the security authorities for strict investigation and handling, they also hope that the Civil Aviation Bureau will punish corrupt officials on its own.</p>

<h3>UK Parties Debate: Artificial Insemination; Mainly for the Government to Study the Whole Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 30th] The recent ruling by a British court that a child born through artificial insemination is illegitimate has sparked heated debate in the House of Lords today. Lord Merriman said that, according to the Council of Physicians, it is prepared to stipulate that the number of pregnancies from the sperm of one person be limited to one hundred at a time. In that case, anyone can have one hundred children at a time through a doctor's hand. If these half-siblings fall in love twenty years later, what will happen to their offspring? Lord Reading suggested that the government should form a committee to study the whole issue. If this matter is prohibited by law, the effect will be no different from the US Prohibition, and it will be carried out in secret. Lord Brabazon said that a child born through artificial insemination is not born of his parents, and is of course illegitimate. It is generally believed that the person who donates sperm must be physically strong and mentally sound. In my opinion, anyone who is willing to donate sperm must be a complete egomaniac, and his mind will definitely not be sound.</p>

<h3>Index-Linked Deposits: Financial Authorities Decide to Launch</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] There have been many rumors recently about the financial authorities launching various forms of deposits. According to a responsible person from the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Finance Minister Liu is considering launching an index-linked deposit, and no other methods have been heard of. The detailed measures for index-linked deposits will be determined and announced after Minister Liu returns to Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is reported that the index-linked deposits will be handled by several banks designated by the Central Bank. The deposits absorbed will be reported to the Central Bank daily. The deposit term will generally be divided into several types, such as five days, ten days, and fifteen days. The index used will not be the cost of living index published by the Municipal Government but possibly the price index compiled by the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank. Since the Central Bank will accept re-deposits, the handling banks will not bear the loss from the index increase, so they should be able to accept the arrangement.</p>

<h3>Former Township Head of Lide Township, Batou Town, Haimen County: Sudden Kidnapping While Seeking Refuge in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Cousin Contacts for Ransom But Fails to Rescue, Reports to Police and Two Criminals Are Arrested</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Yaoming, a native of Haimen, over sixty years old, rents a residence at No. 46 Xiangshan Road, Zhabei. He was formerly the township head of Lide Township, Batou Town, Haimen County. Recently, due to old age and local unrest, he came to Shanghai to reside. Unexpectedly, at about 8:00 AM on the 23rd of last month, four soldiers suddenly came and took him away. His whereabouts were unknown. It was not until 8:00 PM that night that Wang's cousin, Wang Chongwei, came to the residence and learned the whole story. Just as he was about to report to the police for arrest, a fellow villager, Ding Delin, came with a handwritten letter from Wang, which roughly stated that if 50 piculs of white rice were delivered, he could be freed. After Wang read it, he agreed to raise funds.</p>
<p>At dusk the next day, Ding arrived and accompanied Wang to a certain infantry unit in the South City to meet with a battalion commander. After Wang repeatedly pleaded to reduce it to 30 piculs, Wang paid three gold rings weighing eight qian and four checks totaling 1.45 million yuan. Unexpectedly, the battalion commander ordered him to pay another 150,000 yuan as rewards for the orderlies. Wang agreed again. When he delivered the money and met Ding Delin again at 11:00 AM on the 25th, Ding said that the battalion commander was out and would talk after returning to the unit. When Wang returned to the battalion headquarters that night, Ding and the battalion commander had both fled, and he realized he had been deceived. On the morning of the 26th, he rushed to the bank to stop payment, but found that two checks for 500,000 yuan each and one check for 150,000 yuan had been cashed. Around 1:00 PM on the 30th, Ding suddenly returned to Wang's residence, and Wang immediately argued with him. Ding claimed that Wang was hidden near Sichuan Road and Henan Road. Wang forced him to lead the way. When they arrived there, Ding fled again. Wang followed closely and shouted "kidnapping!" Finally, he was intercepted by a police officer and taken to the North Railway Station Police Sub-Bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, he was 23 years old, from Haimen, and served as an adjutant in the battalion. He denied any kidnapping and said that Wang had been selling opium in his hometown and embezzled firearms from the local defense force during his tenure as township head, so he was arrested. Later, according to the confession, another accomplice, Xie Hanchang, was arrested. According to his confession, he was 16 years old, from Haimen, and served as an orderly. He claimed that he knew nothing about this matter, but said that until yesterday morning, he learned that the regiment leader had been detained by his superiors for suspected theft, and the battalion commander was on the run. After recording the confession by Section Chief Yao of the Criminal Division, the above two suspects were sent to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Ancient Tomb in Changzhou (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Dayi</p>
<p>Tomb Brick Decorations</p>
<p>Thanks to the kindness of Mr. Li Tianxing, the 常州 correspondent reported by the county, he accompanied us to the ancient foundations at Qinglong Bridge outside Nandou. However, due to continuous rainy weather, the pit of the foundations was completely filled with water, making it impossible to enter the tomb for a thorough investigation. Mr. Li only asked the local primary school principal to find a tomb brick for us. The decorations on this brick were different from the first one we saw. In addition to the decorations on one face, it also had decorations on the long and short sides. The side decorations were overlapping chevron patterns, while the face decorations consisted of a diamond pattern made of three overlapping lines, paired with large coins supported by diagonal lines as the base. The spaces between the diamond patterns and the large coins were filled with several cross patterns. The pattern on the brick's surface, like the first brick, was created by repeatedly imprinting a model, only about a quarter of the brick's surface area, four times onto the brick. Therefore, the four large coins on this brick were also identical. However, only the character "五" (five) was recognizable on the four characters on the coins, while the other three characters were unrecognizable. Even if we tried to interpret them forcefully, they would still be unintelligible.</p>
<p>The Mystery of the "Fake" Characters</p>
<p>Later, Mr. Li led us to the Zhengbao Newspaper Office, as they also had two tomb bricks from this ancient tomb. One of the tomb bricks had decorations similar to the second one we saw. The other was largely the same as the first one we saw, with the same pattern of banana leaf veins paired with four large coins on the brick's surface. This pattern was also made by repeatedly imprinting a model four times. The only difference was that the banana leaf veins had "main veins," the coins were relatively smaller, with a diameter of only about four centimeters, and only the left and right characters "五" (five) were recognizable on the coins, while the top and bottom characters were also indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Why were the characters above the "五" (five) character unrecognizable on the coins of the two tomb bricks we saw in Changzhou? I think it might be that the brick-making craftsmen did not have much literacy. They randomly drew several seemingly authentic "fake characters" on top of the relatively simple "五" (five) character and considered it done. This is similar to the craftsmen who made porcelain, where the characters in the stamps drawn on the bottom of porcelain bowls were often completely fake and nonsensical. Unfortunately, we were never able to see the model for the tomb brick we saw in Shanghai this time, so we could not confirm whether the coin pattern on the tomb brick we saw in Shanghai was the blurry "大泉五百" (Da Quan Wu Bai - a type of ancient coin) or the blurry "fake characters." However, even if the coin pattern on the tomb brick we saw in Shanghai was not "大泉五百" (Da Quan Wu Bai), we could only say that the age of the ancient foundations may not necessarily be after the fifth year of the Jiahe era of Emperor Wu of the Three Kingdoms. As for the tomb dating back to a period around the Three Kingdoms, that is still correct. The three tomb bricks we saw in Shanghai and Changzhou can still prove the accuracy of this statement.</p>
<p>How to Excavate</p>
<p>Although we could not go inside the ancient foundations for detailed observation, from the exposed parts, the scale was not very large. It was neither the mausoleum of an emperor nor necessarily the tomb of a prominent official or nobleman. The division of the tomb into classrooms is also the usual structure of Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties tombs. Moreover, in our opinion, most of these ancient tombs have been damaged. Undamaged ordinary Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties tombs rarely have economically valuable funerary objects. Damaged ones, of course, even less so. Therefore, if we excavate this ancient tomb with the goal of finding treasures, we will definitely lose our labor and be greatly disappointed. However, to know the life of the deceased buried in the tombs, is a reflection of the living conditions of the people outside the tombs at that time. Therefore, if we want to pursue the state of life of the living at that time and clean up these tomb foundations and examine the life of the deceased in the tomb, that is a very valuable undertaking. However, to do such work, on the one hand, the supervisors must handle the various discovered relics very carefully and fully record the various discovered remains with photographs, drawings, and texts. On the other hand, the workers must also be very careful, otherwise, there is a risk of destroying good materials. Therefore, this is definitely not a problem that can be solved by mobilizing laborers to dig or asking the army to help dig. In this time of war and chaos, it is truly not easy to do the cleanup work of this ancient tomb with minimal regret. Fortunately, Changzhou is a place with a very high level of academic culture. I think the gentlemen who are concerned about academic culture in the local area will definitely be able to come up with a good way to handle this matter properly.</p>
<h3>The Anhui Southern Highway Undergoing Difficult Management</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Dong Min</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper Tunxi, 26th] The main and branch lines of the Anhui Southern Highway after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War have not yet been "restored." The construction funding budget has consistently failed to meet actual needs. For the past four years, it has been a struggle to keep them open. In recent months, the war situation in Anhui Province has reversed the situation. Only the Jiangnan section of the road remains barely passable. According to Ni Chun, Director of the Anhui Southern Office of the Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau, the current situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The section from D渡口 (opposite Anqing) through Dongliu County to Zhizhi County has not been open to traffic since the spring of last year. The planned route to Zhizhi and Shimenjie has not yet been built. The current condition of the section from Shimenjie to Fuliang (Jiangxi Province) is unknown.</p>
<p>(2) The section from Dongliu to Madangzhan, only 60 kilometers of which is within this province, has not been open to traffic for a long time. The remaining section is within Jiangxi Province.</p>
<p>(3) The two lines, Wuhu-Tunxi and Tunxi-Jingdezhen (i.e., Fuliang), were changed to the Jinggan National Highway by order of the Ministry of Communications in August 1947 and are under the jurisdiction of the First District Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. They are currently open to traffic.</p>
<p>(4) The Fanchang-Tongling-Qingyang section is currently being repaired and will be open to traffic soon.</p>
<p>(5) The Qingyang-Yansi section, 165 kilometers long, currently has buses running.</p>
<p>(6) The Tunxi-Jiekou section currently has buses running.</p>
<p>(7) The Tunxi-Yulingguan section belongs to the Hanghui National Highway and has been open to traffic for the longest time.</p>
<p>(8) The Jingwu Line belongs to the Jinggan National Highway and is still open to traffic.</p>
<p>(9) The Xuancheng-泾县 section, a 50-kilometer branch line, has not yet been built.</p>
<p>(10) The Xuan Guangde Line has not been open to traffic for a long time, and the situation is unknown.</p>
<p>(11) The Xuan Nanling Line has not been restored since it was damaged during the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou-Tunxi highway passenger and freight transportation has mainly been carried out by the Hangzhou Automobile Company. In recent years, traffic on this road has been frequent. In order to develop its business, the First Transportation Office has been providing freight services since March 22, facilitating merchants.</p>
<p>The Tunxi-Wuyuan highway has a large amount of earth and stone work. Wuyuan has suffered from disasters for a long time, and the rural areas are devastated. There have been many requests to postpone the start of construction. The Huo (County)-Yu (亭) Highway, only 14 kilometers long, has also been shelved due to the local inability to raise funds for construction. The Jingde-Jixi, Jixi-Fanchang, and Fanchang-泾县 sections were planned to start construction, but they have now been suspended. The lack of funding is a major reason.</p>
<p>People who have been in public service for too long know that the signs of being an official are "Wang Xiaoer celebrating the New Year" (meaning it never happens), so they simply resign and run solo, going to small counties not far from nearby Guiyang to buy pig oil, pork, rice, and American tobacco, and then sell them in Guiyang for a three- or fourfold profit. Otherwise, even if they stay in Guiyang, they specialize in being "shuttle traders" for others, buying and selling on behalf of customers and taking commissions, although it may inevitably lose "face," it is still more profitable than being a public employee. Those who have special influence as a background, embezzle public funds, seize public land, and use their power to engage in private real estate transactions, building the most luxurious dance halls, tea houses, cinemas, and theaters, have recently increased particularly in Guiyang. These people "ride high on the clouds" and are making a fortune everywhere they go.</p>
<p>Private enterprises have long been using other currency systems to replace the gold yuan coupons for the treatment of their employees. The yarn merchants on Guangdong Street pay 30 silver dollars a month to street vendors, 50 silver dollars to directors, and 80 to 100 silver dollars to assistant managers. Except for the Central News Agency, the Central Daily News, and the Guizhou Daily, which are still supporting the gold yuan coupons, the seven or eight privately run daily and evening newspapers are paying their employees a certain number of monthly newspaper subscriptions converted into gold yuan coupons. Some get six or seven subscriptions, others get fifteen or sixteen. At the current price of 3,000 yuan per monthly newspaper subscription, they can earn at least 20,000 yuan and up to 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and their salaries are adjusted according to the newspaper price without any deductions. Private primary and secondary schools, such as Chengwan Middle School run by the Catholic Church, pay each full-time teacher three qian (a unit of weight) of gold per month, and Zhidao Primary School pays five silver dollars. These methods were not conceived or implemented during the Anti-Japanese War, but now they are considered the fairest and most reasonable. I wonder what the people in charge of our country's finance and banking think when they see this.</p>
<p>A case involving a certain military organization stationed in Guiyang and a female reporter from a certain evening newspaper in Guiyang recently occurred, involving kidnapping and extortion. The details are bizarre and complex, involving a large number of people. The case is slowly unfolding. Initially, the relevant personnel of a certain military organization and their subordinates were engaged in business. Later, the subordinates invited outsiders to participate. Because of uneven distribution of profits, the subordinates of the military organization kidnapped one of the outside participants and hid them in a warehouse not far from Guiyang, demanding a ransom. Then, Chen Jiaqi, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, came forward to mediate, and the family of the outside participant paid gold and silver dollars according to the conditions and was released. Unexpectedly, the matter was leaked to a female reporter from a certain evening newspaper. The female reporter went to visit the superior of the military organization and insisted on interviewing about the news. After much discussion, according to people familiar with the inside story and who have evidence, the result was that ten taels of gold were exchanged for a "gentleman's agreement" not to publish the news. However, a paper cannot wrap fire, and the news slowly spread among the people in the news industry and was fully published by a reporter from the Central Daily News to clear his own reputation. Director Chen of the Municipal Health Bureau has asked for leave and left Guiyang. Newspaper editors are conducting a thorough investigation, and the situation is worsening step by step.</p>

<h3>The Harsh Collection Conditions of Public Utilities Cause Great Suffering to the General Public</h3>
<p>Hoping the Municipal Authorities Will Reconsider Improvements to Benefit the Masses</p>
<p>Editor: My family's water is supplied by the British-owned Water Company. This month's bill was received on the morning of the 23rd, and the payment deadline was the 25th of this month. Because the water bill is shared by several households, it takes time to collect the money. It was not collected until the 24th. On the afternoon of the 25th, I went to pay, but because there is a shortage of cash these days and the amount is large, most of the payments from each household were checks. The company's collector said that they would not accept checks, so I returned empty-handed. I went again on the morning of the 26th, but unexpectedly, they said that the bill was overdue and needed to be recalculated on the third floor before it could be paid. After calculation, the increase was as high as 70%. It was said that it was calculated according to the 2279 times index (the original price was calculated according to the 1339.36 times index). Because I did not have such a large amount of extra money on hand, I was unable to pay again, wasting my time and being fined a huge amount, which made me extremely angry. When the company collects payments, it often unreasonably obstructs checks and refuses to accept checks, which has no legal basis. Moreover, there was no prior notice of the late payment penalty (the company's bill only stated "If the full amount is not paid by the due date, the water supply will be suspended" and did not state that if the payment is overdue, it must be paid according to the new index). Now, the company has not obtained the approval of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Municipal Council, so how can it arbitrarily increase the burden on citizens by using the suspension of water supply as a weapon? It is also heard that the telephone company has a similar situation. I hope to publish these facts in the newspaper, and I hope that the Municipal Council and the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau will pay attention to them and quickly stop this abuse of power that exploits citizens.

<p>Letter from Liangyou Fountain Pen Store</p>
<p>To the editor of the Social Services Column of the Shen Bao: After reading the original letter from Mr. Chen in your column yesterday, saying that our store collects money but does not ship goods, we are extremely ashamed! Due to currency inflation and postal delays, the price and shipping costs for out-of-town mail orders have changed a lot by the time the payment arrives. This kind of difficulty, our store has always handled carefully depending on the situation. Mr. Chen's original letter clearly misunderstood the situation, causing a misunderstanding. In addition to sending a special letter to Mr. Chen, we respectfully ask you to publish our letter in your column to dispel doubts and be grateful.

<h3>The Gold Control Bureau Notifies All Commercial Banks and Financial Institutions: No Fixed-Amount Cashier's Checks May Be Issued</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] In view of the recent widespread issuance of cashier's checks by commercial banks and financial institutions, which has inflated credit, and the fact that some banks and financial institutions have even issued fixed-amount cashier's checks without authorization, which is inconsistent with banking regulations, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau recently notified the Silver Money Trust Industry Association to inform all banks and financial institutions that, with the exception of the Central Bank, no other national banks, bureaus, or commercial banks and financial institutions may issue fixed-amount cashier's checks. The following points should be noted when issuing cashier's checks: (1) They must be issued at the request of the customer. (2) Sufficient reserves must be deposited in the Central Bank. (3) All face amounts and signatures of responsible persons must be written in ink and may not be rubber-stamped.</p>
<h3>The Central Bank Throws Out Gold at Closing: The Gold Market's Rising Trend Slightly Subsides</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The gold market trend was firm yesterday. Because prices in other cities were rising and the Hong Kong exchange rate was shrinking, people were optimistic. The opening market trend was still flat, calling 871,000, with slight gains, and slightly fell to 869,000. In the middle of the day, with the strengthening of absorption by the Qingdao Gang and the Shanxi Gang, it rose all the way to 880,000, the upper limit, and closed at 879,000 at noon.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, with the issuance of 50,000 and 100,000 large bills and rumors of currency reform, positive news spread frequently. The banking gang, securities gang, and gold shop gang all turned bullish, and buying was soaring. The opening was at 882,000 and gradually rose to 924,000. At the last moment of closing, the Central Bank, at a price of 8,950,000 yuan, entrusted the Dadecheng Gold Shop to throw out 141 large bars, squeezing in capital of over 1.26 billion, and people's hearts turned calm, closing down to 895,000. Compared with the previous day, it jumped up 95,000, with interest as high as 1.6 yuan. The interbank clearing price was 874,500 in the morning and rose to 900,000 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Off-Exchange</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Off-exchange buying was booming. The morning opened at 870,000, 875,000, fell to 863,000, 868,000, and rose to 888,000, 891,000. The noon close was at 878,000, 881,000. In the afternoon, with the competition of absorption by various gangs, the opening was at 880,000, 885,000, and rose all the way to 930,000, 935,000. The close was slightly lower at 922,000, 927,000. It also rebounded by 48,000. Next-day trading added interest of 70,000 per tael, rising to 992,000, 997,000.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Gold jewelry was stable yesterday morning, still listed at 840,000, 920,000. In the afternoon, due to the surge in gold prices, it rose to 930,000, 1,000,200, and the entry and exit prices increased by another 10,000, with a difference of 90,000. Compared with the previous day, it increased by another 90,000. Silver jewelry also rose by 2,000, rising to 10,500, 12,000. Money changers listed at 870,000, 900,000 in the morning and rose to 900,000, 930,000 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollars</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The off-exchange U.S. dollar market followed the trend. The morning opened at 17,500, 18,000, fell to 17,300, 17,800. The banking gang's import and export search was quite strong, rising all the way to 18,300, 18,800. The noon close was at 18,000, 18,500. In the afternoon, it went even higher, opening at 18,000, 18,500, and gradually rose to 19,300, 19,800. Money changers slightly released some, slightly retreating to 19,000, closing at 19,500. Compared with the previous day, it increased by 1,600. Next-day interest added 1,450, rising to 20,450, 20,950.</p>
<p>Silver Dollars</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Silver dollars on the street are increasingly sought after. Because industrial and commercial enterprises are paying salaries, retail investors are enthusiastically buying them. Moreover, various gangs are still exchanging a lot of money. (1) Local exporters have a large amount of money to exchange, about 1 million from Chongqing and Hankou. (2) In South China, traders in Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places have exchanged about 450,000. Because gold prices in South China are lower and silver dollar prices are still firm, gangs are exchanging large amounts of money using silver dollars. The exchange rate is only 8 yuan per 100 yuan, which is more cost-effective than exchanging gold yuan coupons at 60%. People are firm and holders are reluctant to sell. In the morning, silver dollars rose from 13,000, 14,000 all the way to 15,000, 16,000. In the afternoon, the market was once chaotic, with demand exceeding supply, reaching as high as 15,500, 16,500. In the evening, the market softened slightly. Silver dollars were called at 15,000, 16,000, small-head silver dollars were called at 12,500, 13,500. Eagle Dragon dollars were called at 9,500, 10,500. Check transactions were booming. Money changers were knocking that day with silver dollars initially at 16,000, 17,000, once reaching as high as 18,000, 19,000, and finally 17,000, 18,000, jumping about 20% higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3>White Rice Prices Hit 100,000 Mark, Flour Prices Surge and Quickly Retreat, Cooking Oil Prices Hover at Peak</h3>
<p>Rice prices surged yesterday, with the rise lagging behind other commodities in recent days, so sellers were aggressively pushing prices higher. At the South Market, prices initially rose by 2,000 to 3,000, but later, due to scarce supplies, prices rose again, with white glutinous rice and early indica rice both increasing by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Special glutinous rice was priced at 95,000 yuan. At the North Market, white glutinous rice was at 93,000 yuan, and early indica rice also rose by 7,000 yuan. Retail prices for special glutinous rice have hit the 100,000 mark. Total arrivals at both markets were 6,278 piculs.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Prices, constrained by tight credit, were unable to rise further and hovered at their peak. Prices initially rose by 20,000 to 30,000, but then declined due to increased supplies. Soybean oil closed at 525,000, and rapeseed oil at 470,000, each rising slightly by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Small-batch sesame oil and tea oil remained firm, while soybean cakes were at their original prices.</p>
<p>Flour Market</p>
<p>Surged and quickly retreated, but still remained firm overall. At the start of trading, buyers aggressively purchased flour, creating abnormal chaos and driving prices sharply higher. Old-brand flour reached 37,000 yuan in the central market, with bids reaching 37,500 yuan. Military-brand flour was once bid as high as 36,000 yuan. Later, with gold prices falling slightly, sellers took profits at the high prices, and the market quickly reversed, with old-brand flour trading at 36,800 yuan and military-brand flour closing at 35,400 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Experienced minimal fluctuations, and the market entered a period of consolidation. Soybeans and shelled peanuts remained stable. Mung beans saw increased demand from the Shantou traders, rising by 5,000 yuan. Sesame supply exceeded demand, falling by over 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum showed a slight gain, while corn was initially firm but later weakened.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll</h3>
<p>— Observer</p>
<p>Central Bank Notes Still Discounted – Need to Rewrite Monetary Finance</p>
<p>Banks Unable to Balance Accounts – Harming Themselves</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, silver dollars started to jump wildly again. There will be more excitement in the coming days.</p>
<p>Thank you, Central Bank, for amusing yourselves by recklessly issuing banknotes, claiming to alleviate the cash shortage, but actually increasing the amount of notes in circulation, exacerbating the need for cash, and stimulating the increase in discounts.</p>
<p>Central Bank notes have a prestigious name and are printed more beautifully than those of commercial banks, but in the market, they are discounted at 85% of face value, just like the notes of small and medium-sized banks.</p>
<p>Why does the Central Bank debase the reputation of the national bank in this way?</p>
<p>Strange things happen in chaotic times, and the Central Bank does particularly strange things. I heard that it is very easy for foreign banks to withdraw cash, and that a lot of cash is flowing from the hands of compradors of foreign banks to the discount market.</p>
<p>I also heard that commercial banks have been withdrawing and depositing 1 to 2 million yuan in cash from the Central Bank every day for a long time. This cash is also being transferred to the discount market.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's cash has many uses! But ordinary people and employees have no share in it.</p>
<p>Life is difficult for everyone. Military, police, civil servants, and teachers are particularly miserable. Paying salaries in silver dollars is a promise that can never be fulfilled. Giving them some cash to earn some discounts would make them happy.</p>
<p>However, small civil servants and soldiers never receive cash because these cash funds, intended for national use, are moved around in large bundles for special purposes.</p>
<p>Given all this, the elimination of cash discounts is hopeless.</p>
<p>With financial management like this, all of finance and monetary banking will have to be rewritten by contemporary figures.</p>
<p>While the situation is in a state of waiting, the market is in a state of flux.</p>
<p>However, yesterday afternoon, news that many banks were unable to balance their accounts spread throughout the city, and the situation had not improved by last night. There were also rumors of several clients defaulting. People cannot help but frown.</p>
<p>What is the reason that banks cannot stay stable at this time?</p>
<p>People say that with interest rates so high, banks should be doing well. But in fact, interest income is no longer the banks' way of survival in recent years.</p>
<p>Currently, banks are living in a great contradiction. For banks with large balances, high interest rates mean good profits. For small and medium-sized banks with tight balances, high interest rates mean a heavy burden.</p>
<p>Because most banks are creditors on one hand, welcoming high interest rates, and debtors on the other hand, fearing high interest rates. It is also a common phenomenon for banks to operate like trading companies or enterprises. In normal times, they are more comfortable than trading companies or enterprises because it is easy to move funds and delay the delivery of goods. But when credit tightens, they are not as comfortable as enterprises. Because they have to deal with their own debts and their clients' payments. It is really hard to bear two burdens at once.</p>
<p>Many things are like shooting oneself in the foot. For example, the recent instability of banks is due to the fact that ordinary customers are unwilling to deposit funds because they cannot get cash.</p>
<p>In the past, when industrial and commercial sectors received funds, whether cash or checks, everyone deposited them in the bank, preferring to pay with their own checks.</p>
<p>Since cash has become scarce, banks have been holding onto cash and only paying with banknotes. Even those who deposit cash only receive banknotes. This practice has forced customers to lose money on banknote discounts, making them unwilling to deposit funds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all transactions now involve the exchange of notes. All the notes received, large and small, used to be deposited in the bank and a check was issued to make up the price of the goods and pay the other party. Everyone is receiving and paying in this way, so there is no need to deposit in the bank.</p>
<p>Most customers no longer need or find it convenient to deposit in the bank for transactions. As a result, the amount of funds received by most banks has decreased significantly, or has not increased, or the increase is not equal to the multiple increases in commodity prices. This can be seen from the daily statistics of check clearing. Therefore, the situation of banks is even more difficult.</p>
<h3>Large Denomination Notes to be Issued Today – Credit Possibly to Tighten</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Credit was tight yesterday. The overnight loan rate opened at 80 yuan per thousand, rising to 100 yuan per thousand around 11:00 AM. In the afternoon, it eased back to around 80 yuan, but around 3:00 PM, due to strong demand from various industries, the overnight loan rate rose to 100 yuan. Later, due to the outflow of treasury funds, it eased back to around 70 yuan. Yesterday, domestic banks had a net outflow of 1.5 billion, while foreign banks had a net inflow of 800 million. The large clearing house had an inflow of 1.6 billion, and the small clearing house had an outflow of 900 million. Today, the national bank will issue large denomination notes of 5,000 and 10,000 yuan, which are expected to be sold to prevent possible price increases, and credit will likely tighten.</p>
<h3>Trade Commission Holds Regular Meeting on Discount and Loans – Approves Three Loan Applications</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Trade Advisory Committee of the Central Bank Discount and Loan Committee held its 12th regular meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Chen Changtong, and approved three loan applications. Furthermore, the Discount and Loan Committee is establishing a review subcommittee for loans for ordering production projects, focusing on basic industries, mining, daily necessities, and export materials. It is expected to be established within days. It is also learned that after the committee began accepting applications for ordering loans, many manufacturers have been visiting the committee to obtain blank application forms.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions Scarce, Prices Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the tea market, although buying interest was not strong, sellers were unwilling to sell at lower prices. Unfounded rumors spread like mushrooms after rain, leading to continued scarce transactions and firm prices. Fortunately, in the afternoon, credit in the industry shifted from loose to tight, and the price increases eased slightly.</p>
<p>It is learned that after the retail prices of tea were adjusted on the 16th of this month, due to the lack of tea in stock and the sharp rise in tea prices in line with general commodities, the prices were no longer in line with costs. Therefore, starting today, changes will be made, increasing prices by one level. For example, the highest price for Longjing green tea was originally 32,000 yuan per catty, but is now 48,000 yuan; the lowest price was originally 1,600 yuan per catty, but is now 2,400 yuan. All other prices will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<h3>Domestic Stocks Firm, Then Soar</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Domestic stock market closed firmer yesterday after a period of consolidation. At the opening, prices were pressured by outflows of remittances to other areas and by tight credit in the market on the last day of the three-day settlement period. The publication of the cost of living index and the fact that factories were raising funds to pay salaries led to selling pressure, preventing prices from rising. Later, as prices of goods outside the market rose sharply, especially gold, and some commercial banks remitted funds out, easing the cash situation, buying interest returned to the market and prices rose rapidly. Yung Shing Cotton Mill opened at 9.85 yuan, and both domestic and foreign bulls covered their short positions, pushing prices down to 9.65 yuan. New short positions were covered, and prices rose again to 10.035 yuan and 10.04 yuan. Afterwards, yarn sellers entered the market, and banks frequently took profits, causing the market to consolidate. Near noon, credit eased slightly and gold prices were firm, leading to aggressive buying and pushing prices up to 10.05 yuan at the noon close.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized open-market stocks opened flat and closed higher at noon. Hsin Ho opened at 2.80 yuan, reached a high of 3.10 yuan, and closed at 3.00 yuan at noon. Hsin Kuang opened and reached a high of 1.13 yuan and closed at that high at noon. Ching Fu traded around 0.45 yuan and closed at 0.445 yuan at noon. Chin Hsing opened at 0.50 yuan, reached a high of 0.61 yuan, and closed at 0.605 yuan at noon. Mei Ya opened at 3.05 yuan and rose to 3.28 yuan before falling back slightly at the noon close. Other stocks also saw sharp increases.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, due to tight credit in the morning, buying interest was suppressed, and the increased cost of living index raised confidence. Yung Shing Cotton Mill initially reached a high of 11.70 yuan, hitting the limit up. Later, rumors of gold sales caused bulls to become fearful, and prices fell to 11.10 yuan. Finally, yarn sellers and Guangdong yarn merchants resumed buying, boosting the market again and hitting the limit up. Off-exchange trading opened at 11.00 yuan, fell to 10.07 yuan, and finally rebounded to close at 11.05 yuan. Total turnover for the day was 5,457,100,000 shares.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks stopped falling and rose yesterday due to strong foreign exchange and stock market conditions and firm gold prices. All stocks soared. Ewo Cotton Mill traded at 27,000 yuan, 28,000 yuan, and then rose to 30,000 yuan. Union Insurance traded at 32,000 yuan, 35,000 yuan, and rose 1,000 yuan. Jardine Matheson traded at 9,000 yuan, 9,500 yuan, also rising 1,000 yuan. Wheelock Marden reached 100,000 yuan, 100,500 yuan, rising rapidly by 15,000 yuan. Asia Navigation traded at 2,800 yuan, 2,900 yuan. Other stocks also saw significant gains.</p>
<p>Gold bonds initially bid at 580,000 yuan and rose all the way to 650,000 yuan, closing at 590,000 yuan at noon. There were no trades in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Exchanging Flour for Coal</h3>
<p>Kailan Mining Administration in Negotiations</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to sources, the Kailan Mining Administration plans to supply coal to Shanghai by shipping 300,000 bags of flour to North China in exchange for 100,000 metric tons of bituminous coal. The terms are three bags of flour for one metric ton of coal, with both flour and coal to be delivered in Qinhuangdao, North China. All round-trip shipping, transportation insurance, and partial hull insurance, as well as other expenses, will be borne by the supplier of the flour. The coal obtained will be sold to public enterprises at cost without profit. It is learned that North China levies import and export taxes, with coal subject to an export tax of 30% and flour subject to an import tax of 15%. The Mining Administration is currently negotiating with relevant parties, and once resolved, the flour-for-coal contract will be finalized.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The prices of various types of coal from the Four Mines Joint Venture were adjusted yesterday as follows: Keelung coal at 184,100 yuan per ton, foreign bituminous coal at 508,320 yuan, and Kailan coal at 225,680 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market to Rise, Cloth Market Stable</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was flat at first and then strong yesterday. In the morning, the market was very quiet due to tight credit, and there was a strong desire to sell. Later, the release of the cost of living index stimulated sentiment, and prices rose sharply at noon. 21-count Double Horse Rainbow opened at 3.16 million, and after opening, absorption was not strong, and the market was hovering. Later, because of the rising gold market and the increase in the cost of living index, buyers began to take positions, and the market immediately rose, rising to 3.25 million at noon, up 300,000. 20-count Golden City was at 3.09 million, also up 200,000. 16-count was up 120,000, and 10-count was up slightly by 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix initially traded at 6.35 million and also saw consolidation after opening. However, because coarse yarn was firm and replicate industries continued to absorb, bids were raised and then rose again, closing at 6.40 million at noon, up 400,000. 40-count was up 550,000, and 30-count was up 200,000.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market softened slightly due to extremely tight credit in the industry, but the industry's sentiment was very good. Everyone was optimistic, and the potential trend was still solid and trending upwards. Buyers and sellers were not moving much. Supply and demand were corresponding, so the trend was mostly opened flat. After seeing slightly higher bids, there was another decline, and the market rebounded again when gold prices rebounded.</p>
<p>Dragon fine cloth opened at 132,000 yuan and first saw a high price of 135,000 yuan. The Textile Construction Company sold various kinds of cotton cloth, including Dragon Head B fine cloth and large Dragon Head fine cloth. People's minds turned empty, and interest was secretly bid at 90 yuan, and there were many who sold out. Prices fell to 126,000 yuan and closed at 131,000 yuan at noon, down 1,500 yuan from the previous day. Dragon Head B fine cloth fell slightly by 2,000 yuan to trade at 116,000 yuan. Large Double Dragon and Flower and Bird fine cloth traded at 107,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge opened at 109,000 yuan in the morning, reached a high of 118,000 yuan, then fell to 107,000 yuan, and closed at 114,500 yuan at noon, down 2,000 yuan. Colored cloth saw a slight increase.</p>

<h3>Ren Yu Scores New High, Hai Qing is Weak</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Ren Yu basketball team defeated the Hai Qing team 72-34 last night, setting a new record for the highest score in the four-team basketball league. Their second-place position was also determined at the end of the game.</p>
<p>Ren Yu's performance last night was not ideal. Because they still need to play against Shanghai Police this Saturday and in order to conserve their strength, the main players did not dare to go all out. Also, they were intentionally trying to surpass the record of 69 points they scored against Hai Qing in the first week. They focused on offense and not defense. Therefore, the Charlton navy officers, whose strength is only at the Class B level, were able to score 34 points. The entire game was not exciting. Ren Yu's signature smokescreen offense was not effective because Hai Qing played a zonal defense that was neither fish nor fowl and easily broken. Wu Xinyun and Yao Wenyi did not shoot well, but the score still reached 72. This shows how weak Hai Qing is.</p>
<p>Sun Guozheng of Ren Yu was sick, and Cai Jindian and Zhuang Yirong were absent. Wu Xinyun, Xu Zhongyi, Yao Wenyi, Shen Pengju, and Li Zhaohe started the game. Hai Qing took the lead with a free throw. Ren Yu's Xiao Wu scored with a hook shot. Wenyi threw the ball in from the corner. Zhongyi and Pengju successively scored with one hand. In an instant, they took a 12-2 lead. Hai Qing was unable to keep up and made frequent mistakes. All the rebounds were taken by Li Zhaohe. At 33-13, Ren Yu substituted Chen Weiyuan and Yan Bin to give the main players a chance to rest. The first half ended with a large lead of 38-15.</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Ren Yu went all out, and their offensive was unstoppable. After taking a 35-point lead, [Old Man] Weiyuan came on again and scored four points for Ren Yu with two medium-distance shots. Hai Qing took advantage of Ren Yu's relaxed defense and counterattacked with all their might, scoring a lot of points, but Yao Wenyi and Wang Huaiting kept scoring in return, maintaining a 38-point lead. In the end, they stepped up the offense to score, and the game ended with Ren Yu winning 72-34. The results are as follows:</p>

<p>Fat Team Loses to Ping Ping</p>
<p>The Class B-C Fat team played Ping Ping with a small crowd watching. The Fat team took the offensive at the start, with Sun Mingxin scoring two baskets in a row. Ping Ping's Xia Zhiao, Wang Weijun, Li Yongji, and others were not to be outdone, and quickly overwhelmed the Fat team 12-6. Dong Yangfeng's long-distance runs showed that the enemy's momentum was difficult to stop. At halftime, Ping Ping led 27-24.</p>
<p>In the second half, both sides made many substitutions, and the situation was very close, with the difference often only two or three baskets. Ping Ping's Xia and Li and the Fat team's Zhang Shaoqing scored a lot of points. In the end, Ping Ping won 52-47.</p>

<h3>Annamite Tennis Champions to Perform in Hong Kong – Van Sau Has Defeated Four French Davis Cup Players</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Air Mail] Annamite tennis stars VAN SAU and DUONG, scheduled to perform in Hong Kong on April 2, 4, and 5, arrived in Hong Kong at 2:00 PM on the 30th via French Airways with Annamite Paris Tennis Club representative Wan En. Wan Feng is the team leader for this trip. The sixth-ranked French player, Du Bei, will arrive on April 3. The three are staying at the Hong Kong Hotel. According to their team leader, "Van Sau and Ong both participated in the recent French Open, with good results. If the Hong Kong champion can defeat Van Sau, he will be a rare talent."</p>
<p>According to the team leader, Van Sau has defeated French Davis Cup representatives such as Pousas, Brally, Maddi Dupay Lisa, etc. His results are as follows: defeated Brally 6-3, 8-6; defeated Madibo 6-3, 3-6, 6-2; defeated Palasa 2-6, 8-6, 6-1; defeated Pousas 2-6, 5-7, 7-5, 6-4, 6-2. In 1945, Van Sau once defeated Du Bei, the current French No. 6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-0. Van Sau reached the semi-finals of the French Open this time before losing to French No. 1 Pannat 6-4, 6-2, 7-5. As for Ong, he is the Tokyo champion and Saigon runner-up. In 1947-48, he participated in three competitions in France and managed to win one set against the fifth-ranked French player Ada Salim before losing 6-4, 5-7, 6-2. He is calm during games and easy to get along with.</p>
<p>The two are scheduled to perform at the Chinese Recreation Club in Causeway Bay starting at 3:00 PM on the 2nd. Ong will first play a best-of-three singles match against Cai Huiquan, our Davis Cup representative who recently returned from Singapore. Then, Hong Kong champion Ye Guanxiong will play a best-of-five singles match against Van Sau. Given Ye Guanxiong's performance this year, we all have high hopes for him. To have such a person come to compete is a touchstone for him. We hope that Guanxiong can work hard and make a splash.</p>
<p>The competition schedule is as follows: In addition to the two singles matches at the Chinese Recreation Club as mentioned above, the remaining matches will be held at the Hong Kong Cricket Club grounds next Monday and Tuesday. On the 4th, starting at 4:15 PM, Xu Weipei will first play a best-of-three singles match against Van Sau, followed by Ye Guanxiong playing a best-of-five singles match against Du Bei. On the 5th, starting at 4:15 PM, Ong will first play a best-of-three singles match against a Hong Kong player, followed by the Hong Kong doubles champions—which will be either the Xu-Xu team or the Ye-Li team—playing against Du Bei and Van Sau. As for the Hong Kong player who will play singles against Ong, it is said that if the Hong Kong champions are Ye and Li, then Ong's opponent will be Xu Runpei. If the Hong Kong champions are still the Xu-Xu team, then Liang Ziji will most likely play against Ong.</p>

<h3>Ping Pong Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Written by Wang Xin-jing, Edited by Chen Lin-sheng (3)</p>
<p>Practice Section</p>
<p>Thinking in your heart and speaking with your mouth is not as good as actually doing it. There are many ways to play ping pong, and many ways to learn these methods: some require using your eyes to see, some require using your ears to hear, and some require using your brain to think. But all these methods you see, hear, and think of must be realized through practice.</p>
<p>How should you block a certain ball? How should you attack a certain ball? How should you hit a chopped ball? ... Understanding in your heart is useless; you must actually try it to make it useful.</p>
<p>In fact, mastering a certain hitting technique is not something that can be learned in one or two tries. Even if you learn it, you must become proficient in it to be useful. To become proficient, you must practice, you must practice a lot. The more you practice, the more freely you can apply it and the more deeply you can understand it. Therefore, to have interest in the sport and to improve your skills, you must practice a lot.</p>
<p>1. Practice and Equipment</p>
<p>Ping pong equipment is the simplest and easiest among ball sports. Speaking casually, you can have fun anywhere with a few wooden boards or two tables. But this is just for casual playing. If you have the means, it is best to have equipment based on standards for formal practice. This will be very advantageous in future competitions.</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Ping Pong Room Now let's first talk about a standard ping pong room: The volume of a standard ping pong room must have 10 feet of open space at each end of the table and 6 feet of open space on each side. There should be at least 9 feet of space from the table surface to the ceiling. Including the ping pong table, the ping pong room should be at least:</p>
<p>Length: 29 feet;</p>
<p>Width: 17 feet 8 inches to 18 feet;</p>
<p>Height: 11 feet 6 inches or more.</p>
<p>In the middle of both sides of the ping pong table, 3 feet away from the table, place the seats for the referees and the recording table.</p>
<p>If you want to prepare for accommodating spectators, then the length and width must be expanded accordingly. And it is best to have seats arranged around the perimeter, and the height of the seats should be higher in the back rows to avoid the people in the front rows blocking the view of the people in the back rows.</p>
<p>The floor must be covered with thick flooring and must be kept clean.</p>
<p>The surrounding walls are best in white color.</p>
<p>The light in the ping pong room must shine in from both sides. For example, if the table is placed north-south, then the east and west sides must have more windows to allow sufficient light to enter. If the table is placed east-west, the light must enter fully from the south and north sides.</p>
<p>Many ping pong practices are in the evening. The source of light relies entirely on electric lights. The electric lights must be suspended in the center of both ends of the ping pong table. It must be slightly higher than the table to avoid hindering the hitting of the ball. It is best to add a white porcelain shade to the outside of the light bulb to allow the light to radiate evenly in all directions.</p>
<p>Few people often pay attention to the layer of light. This matter seems to have little relationship at first glance, but in practice, there are disadvantages of backlighting or dazzling, reducing interest and affecting the progress of skills at the same time. In competitions, it will cause incorrect results. So this should be noted.</p>
<p>Standard Ping Pong Table The non-standard ping pong room makes it impossible to fully develop the ability to hit the ball, and the impact of the standard of the ping pong table is even greater. A ping pong table that is standard for daily practice can be as easy to use as in practice during competitions. If the ping pong table used for daily practice is casually put together, then it will inevitably be difficult to grasp during competitions, giving the opponent a chance to take advantage of, and putting oneself under great pressure.</p>
<p>According to the world's current ping pong rules, the standard ping pong table should be placed horizontally and must meet the following requirements: (A) Length: 2.743 meters (ie 9 feet); (B) Width: 1.524 meters (ie 5 feet); (C) Height: 0.762 meters (ie from the ground to the table surface is 2 feet 6 inches); (D) The table surface must be smooth, and there is no limit to what kind of material it is made of, but it must be able to make the ping pong ball dropped from 0.5 cm (1 foot) above the table surface bounce to 20.3 cm (8 inches) to 22.9 cm (9 inches) high. (E) The entire table surface and table legs should be painted in a non-reflective dark green color. (F) A white border line of 1.9 cm (three-quarters of an inch) wide should be painted around the edge of the table surface. (G) The installation of the table legs should be at least 20 cm (4 inches) away from the table end and table side.</p>
<p>The ping pong net is stretched parallel to the center of the straight side line on both sides of the ping pong table and the horizontal lines at both ends. This net must have the following conditions: (A) Net height 15.2 cm (6 inches); (B) Net length: 1.829 meters (6 feet); (C) The net must be white, and each mesh is three-quarters of an inch; (D) A light brown edge of three-quarters of an inch wide is sewn on the upper end of the net; (E) The two sides must be tightly attached to the ping pong posts, and the lower end must be connected to the table surface; (F) It must be taut and straight.</p>
<p>The ping pong posts are installed on the table edge in the middle of both sides of the table, extending 15.2 cm (6 inches) from the table surface, the top of the post is 15.2 cm (6 inches) above the table surface, and at right angles to the table.</p>

<h3>Lying Without Restraint</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuo-zhi</p>
<p>Western customs can work in China in every way, except for April Fool's Day, which will never work.</p>
<p>Why? Because the Chinese people have been fooled and deceived for thousands of years, kept in the dark. Since they are being fooled 365 days a year, why bother to specify a day as April Fool's Day?</p>
<p>This Western holiday is translated as "Fool's Day" in Chinese. The word "fool" is really too elegant and difficult to understand. In fact, it may as well be translated directly as "Liar's Day" or "Lying Day." Why should lying have a holiday? Because people usually don't lie much, they are not allowed to lie, but lying is a kind of latent desire in human nature, so this day is specifically set to let everyone lie to their heart's content, which is also giving this emotion an official release. As for us? Deceiving people is proper, lying is commonplace. Which day are the common people not being deceived, fooled? Today, you exchange two gold yuan for one silver dollar, and tomorrow, you sell it back to you for seven thousand yuan, making you a profit of 3,500 times out of thin air!</p>
<p>Didn't the sage say long ago: "When you want to be wise, you want the soldiers to be foolish." Why do you want to be wise? Because you can deduct military pay and eat empty salaries; why do you want the soldiers to be foolish? Because you can make them share five hundred gold yuan among three people and still endure it. By extension, naturally officials want to be wise and the people want to be foolish, so all kinds of deceiving and fooling the people are just the military following the teachings of the sage.</p>
<p>In a place where everyone talks and everyone deceives, it is difficult not to lie. If everyone calls a deer a horse, calls black white, and if you are the only one who says this is a deer, this is black, then you will not only be ridiculed, but you may even face death. Chinese politics has always used lying to deceive the people as the only rule for thousands of years; and the common people themselves have also used mutual fraud as the foundation for establishing themselves in the world. Under such circumstances, since lying is commonplace, then it would be too much trouble to set a fixed holiday for lying.</p>
<p>April Fool's Day will not work in China. The day it works is a blessing for the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Tablet of Inferior Governance</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ji-shi</p>
<p>During the Tang Dynasty, Liu Gongquan and He Jin-tao both had "Tablets of Virtuous Governance."</p>
<p>During the Jin Dynasty, Wang Jun of Fufeng had virtuous governance, and the western people erected a tablet for him, and all who saw it bowed down. These two did not lose the meaning of "Tablet of Virtuous Governance."</p>
<p>However, looking at the officials who are mostly "hypocritical" and the many who flatter them, I am afraid that many are using trusted subordinates to collude with inferior gentry to fabricate "virtuous governance" and erect "political tablets."</p>
<p>Therefore, Bai Juyi's poem about green stone has: "I don't want to be a tablet of virtuous governance by the roadside for officials, not to engrave the real record but to engrave false words." It is not only satire to the bone, but also a realistic portrayal.</p>
<p>According to a report in this newspaper on the 28th, "Ye Chun-jie, the magistrate of Chongqing County, Sichuan, was recently transferred due to a case. The people of the county, in order to commemorate his various inferior deeds of corruption and exploitation during his tenure, specially presented him with a Tablet of Inferior Governance, erected in the county to commemorate his departure. The couplet is: 'Going early, the numbers have eyes; leaving late a few days, the land has no skin.' The horizontal inscription says: 'Forever leave an infamous name.'" It is written directly and frankly. The so-called "leaving late a few days, the land has no skin" refers to the officials' extortion, which is the case everywhere. All crows in the world are black, and it is not only the magistrate of Chongqing County who is like this.</p>
<p>The world is difficult, and "extortion" is everywhere. We truly admire the boldness of the people of Chongqing County, who "speak frankly and directly." But China is so big, I am afraid that even the green stone of Lantian Mountain cannot fully engrave "Tablets of Inferior Governance," right?</p>
<h3>Fool</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qi-qu</p>
<p>Do you remember? Today—April 1st—is April Fool's Day! Be careful not to be fooled!</p>
<p>The custom of April Fool's Day originated in the West and is called April-fool, or All Fools' Day. Before the war, some people in China "used Western learning for practical purposes." At that time, a newspaper in Beiping published a small news item saying that Dr. Hu Shi had died of a sudden illness last night. That day, Hu Shi's relatives, friends, and students were shocked and rushed to Hu's residence to offer condolences. When they saw Hu Shi sitting at home safe and sound, they realized they had been fooled. However, although those who were fooled were annoyed, they were always happier than seeing "really dead," so they just laughed it off.</p>
<p>The following year, a newspaper in Nanjing published a marriage announcement on its cover of the famous painter Xu Beihong and Jiang Biwei. They were originally an old couple and had been married in France long ago. How could they be getting married again now? It turned out that the two of them were having some minor disputes at the time, which had the potential to turn small matters into big ones. Therefore, someone deliberately made a joke to them, as a fool or as a satire, and the parties and those involved in the dispute could not pursue it because it occurred on April Fool's Day.</p>
<p>Last year's April Fool's Day was also quite lively in Shanghai. Among them, the most eye-catching news was the suicide of painter Liu Shi and movie star Ouyang Shafei. The former was reported by Xu Xin-qin, Liu Shi's close friend, and the latter even had photos as proof, so many people were fooled.</p>
<p>According to Western customs, although anyone can lie on this day, they must immediately say that it is April Fool's after the other party is fooled or just about to be fooled, to avoid making a big mistake. This is the morality that a fool should have.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to choose the material for fooling carefully. Rumors like those mentioned above, although they harm people temporarily, do not cause much harm. But if you directly accuse someone who has contributed to the country of being a criminal, or falsely accuse a hero who has benefited the people of being a bandit, even if you are not punished by law on April Fool's Day, it is still a bit unkind.</p>
<p>Secondly, you can't make jokes in the most tense moments. If someone were to spread a rumor today saying, "The Communist Army in Jiangbei has fully crossed the Yangtze River, and peace talks have been suspended as a result," this joke would not only be too big, but also too immoral.</p>
<p>This is what the fool should pay attention to. As for the person being fooled, although they may be a little angry, they do not have to be suspicious of everything on this day. For example, if there is news today that "Wu Guozhen has been transferred to the Minister of Foreign Affairs," that may be "fooling"; but if he suspects it is fake even if he goes to Hangzhou today, then he is being too sensitive.</p>
<p>By analogy, for example, in the peace talks held in Beiping, the conditions put forward by both sides may not be completely free of "fooling" components; but if the representatives all have the heart of "Don't fool me there?" because today is April Fool's Day, then it will not be easy to reach an agreement. Therefore, the fool should have the morality of a fool, and the person being fooled must also have the magnanimity to tolerate others, so as not to become a real fool.</p>
<h3>Not Lying Is Abnormal</h3>
<p>— Bin-zhi</p>
<p>If someone asks you: "Do you lie?" You will definitely answer in the negative, "No." In fact, the number of people who have never told a lie in their lives is the smallest of the smallest. Someone once did a statistic proving that 97 percent of people have lied, most of them occasionally, and a few habitually.</p>
<p>Two professors at Yale University have done detailed research on lying. They spent four years surveying 11,000 people and found that the number of lies told is inversely proportional to intelligence; the smarter the person, the fewer lies they tell; but even the most intelligent people cannot avoid telling some lies.</p>
<p>Since lying is a behavior that most people have, it is naturally a normal phenomenon; conversely, not lying becomes a symptom of abnormality. However, society still praises the abnormal "honesty" and despises the normal "lying." Therefore, people generally still refuse to admit this exceptional normal behavior, but instead point to lying as abnormal, which is actually a psychological contradiction.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that honesty is a virtue, but why do people lie? Isn't that strange? In fact, people have to be somewhat artificial in order to adapt to the environment. The most common thing is that in a large gathering, when talking to polite people, you always have to say a few polite words, and there are untrue words among them. Although these words are insignificant, a lie is still a lie. Isn't adapting to the environment a normal behavior?</p>
<p>In court, the words of the criminal cannot be completely true. Although the judge uses various methods to interrogate the criminal, it is difficult to obtain the complete truth. Committing a crime is a dishonorable act, and lying is also improper. He chooses to lie to avoid the more serious and lessen his crime. This is seeking to live, seeking to survive, and of course it is also a normal psychological expression.</p>
<p>When a doctor sees a very serious patient, he always has to hide some of the truth from the patient, not willing to tell the patient the real situation himself, for fear that the patient will become more ill from fear and worry. Of course, there are a few lies in the doctor's words to the patient. In this situation, lying cannot be said to be wrong; kindness and sympathy are also normal phenomena that should be present in the psychology.</p>
<p>The above is about intentional lying. There is also lying without knowing it. Especially in a sudden occurrence, because attention is not concentrated, words of guesswork are often mixed in. Someone once showed a film of a car accident to many people, and after watching it, asked them to answer a few questions. As a result, almost everyone got the things in the film a little wrong, only the degree of wrongness varied. No one answered all twenty questions correctly. Therefore, the words of eyewitnesses are often lies, but they are unintentional.</p>
