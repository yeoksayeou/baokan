<h3>滬郊各綫共軍難逃覆滅　國軍陣地屹立無恙　黃渡南翔放棄·南匯對外電訊中斷虹橋機塲北發現共軍竄擾正接觸中</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍方五月十五日下午九時發佈戰訊：</p>
<p>（一）大上海保衛戰今已進入第四日，由於我陸海空軍之緊密協同，發揮威力，已使各綫犯匪遭遇慘重之挫敗，現被我誘入若干袋形陣地之匪，已難逃覆滅之命運。自十四日晚起，劉行地區之殲滅戰，亦已猛烈展開，匪某部主力三個師，在我强烈砲火壓制下，傷亡已達一萬餘人，但匪乃不斷增援反撲，我軍士氣旺盛，反覆衝殺，匪傷亡枕藉，劇烈戰鬭尙在繼續進行中。又，月浦楊行一綫犯匪，經我分別圍殲擊退後，迄十五日午戰况已轉沉寂。</p>
<p>（二）犯匪廿九軍八十五·八十七兩個師主力負創潰退後，十四日午後二時起，匪另以廿八軍主力向我月浦楊行劉行正面再度猛犯，我守軍沉着應戰，於誘匪深入後，卽以陸海空軍密集火力，逐步展開圍殲，自十五日晨至午，劉行楊行陣地前匪遺屍已達三千餘具，我鹵獲戰利品無算，陣地屹然無恙。</p>
<p>（三）土共千餘人，於昨（十四日）自奉賢鶴河等地向南匯竄擾，刻該地對外電訊中斷。</p>
<p>（四）據報：松江蘇州方面之匪後援部隊，正陸續向我前進中，我各方守軍，正嚴密注視，決予匪以重大之打擊。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防衛司令部發表戰况：</p>
<p>（一）我虹橋機塲北南園七寶及翁板橋等前進陣地，昨午後六時左右各發現兵力番號不詳之匪，向我方陣地竄擾，刻正與我守軍接觸中。</p>
<p>（二）按兩日來匪不斷增兵向我劉行以北陣地施行一貫之入海衝鋒戰術，且有攻擊者稱之廿八軍參加其間，然終不能越過雷池一步，此雖由於我陸海空配合適當，步砲密切協同，尤以我將士英勇用命之忠貞精神所致，實為匪軍攻滬之當頭一棒也。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍方十五日上午十一時消息：大上海保衛戰開始後，我依預定計劃十四日已主動放棄黃波·南翔，向主陣地集結兵力，準備聚殲進犯之匪。</p>
<h3>「火海」消滅「人海」　海陸空軍協同發揮威力月浦楊行共軍遺屍遍野</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防衛司令部發佈戰况：</p>
<p>（一）十四日晚黃昏起，詎廿八廿九兩軍，以五個師及一個旅之兵力，向我月浦楊行陣地以波浪式戰法猛撲，連續進攻五次之多，均被我忠勇官兵，以熾盛火力消滅於陣地前，匪遺屍遍野，經此嚴重打擊，匪受創慘重，至午夜後，戰事遂陷沉寂，我士氣極為旺盛，咸抱殲匪決心。</p>
<p>（二）匪廿八軍兩個師，在十四日黃昏時，以人海戰術向我劉家行陣地猛撲我部某師官兵沉着應戰，迄深夜，匪被誘竄入袋形陣地，已掃數聚殲。</p>
<p>（三）我軍於十四日上午十時，由月浦出擎，逆襲匪八十七師，計殲匪二千七百五十各，生俘二百六十四名，獲輕重機槍步槍百五十多枝，其他戰利品甚夥。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍方十五日上午十一時消息：</p>
<p>（一）匪主力二萬餘，連日向我月浦鎭南北之綫國軍陣地猛烈進犯，經我守軍配合裝甲都隊奮勇迎戰，同時我海軍××××××等艦，在××一帶發砲，向匪軍陣地猛烈轟擊，隆隆之聲不絕於耳，大批神鷹亦晝夜出動，與地面部隊密切配合，發揮最大之效果，來犯匪軍在我陸海空三軍團擊痛殲下，計斃匪五千餘，俘八百餘，鹵獲輕重武器彈藥輜重不計其數，匪攻勢受挫，卽紛紛潰退，迄目前止，戰况已趨沉寂。</p>
<p>（二）匪主力某部三個師，於十四日分股自羅店南竄，以猛烈砲火掩護，向我楊行及劉行國軍陣地猛犯，我守軍奮勇迎戰，砲兵某部亦發揮高度威力，發砲助戰，匪數次猛攻，均被擊退，傷亡慘重，難以數計。</p>
<h3>吳淞巡禮</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕過去兩夜血戰，雖僅在數英里以外之地進行，然吳淞鎭迄今仍未受絲毫戰爭損害。據某海軍陸戰團團長稱：吳淞之所以尙未受戰爭損害者，因共軍之砲，尙不足置該鎭於射程之內。今晨除零星砲聲，及一兩鈔鐘從某地傳來之機關槍聲外，吳淞安寗若無戰爭一般，雖說在不過十二小時以前血戰尙在其西方各據點進行，而在十二小時後血戰之發生亦為可料之事。據聞某一時期，共軍離淞鎭之近，已至危險程度，但現已被驅逐，該鎭至少能暫得安全。前綫士氣高揚樂觀氣氛，到處盈溢，若干海陸軍官兵，於與記者談論，戰爭時如中學學生之談論球類比賽，興奮而欣然。最近以來，雖有若干要堅據點放棄，但前綫士兵精神未為稍挫，且俱深信彼等能將共軍驅逐，海軍方面尤有自信。據該陸戰團長稱：自陸軍獲得生力海軍船隻增援後，囂張之共軍，亦一變而為謹愼，略收其氣燄。該團長順告記者：共軍之傷亡，十倍於國軍，推原其故，一則由於彼等之「人海」戰術，一則由放彼等幾經常在攻勢之中。記者沿途見裝備優良之國軍，開赴前綫，除此而外，亦有三五士兵，於短期休假之後，自返前綫。記者之車，曾過此類兵士三人於中途搭車，彼等屬於某部之工兵部隊，據稱該部隊曾於某地擊潰共軍三團，與開赴前綫之部隊成對照者，則為成羣結隊之難民，湧向上海而來，人數之多，交通每為之阻塞，難民俱外露沉靜之色，蓋亦聽天由命，在人羣之中，亦偶發現微笑面容，中國老百姓之忍耐精神，於此可見一斑。</p>
<h3>淞滬防衛司令部　統一發佈戰訊</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬地區戰訊，原由警備司令部傳副參謀長統一發佈，現因上海保衛戰已揭開序幕，淞滬防衛司令部主持作戰事宜，且該部政工處新近組織成立，為使戰事消息傳遞迅速，報導詳盡，自今（十六）日起，改由該部政工處統一發佈，時間仍為每日上午十時及下午九時各一次，交由中央通訊社轉發。</p>
<h3>吳淞要塞安如磐石　海軍砲火掩護陸軍應戰收效極大</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕海軍總司令部發言人昨對記者稱：本軍駐滬艦艇，自十二日開始配合陸空軍參加保衛大上海戰爭，連日戰果異常豐碩，尤以前（十三）昨（十四）兩日，我艦多艘，對獅子林·月浦·楊行·劉行一帶來犯之匪軍施行無情的猛烈砲擊，掩護陸軍應戰，收效極大。據報：匪軍被擊斃者已達五千人以上，匪砲兵陣地亦被摧毀多處，現匪軍為避免海軍砲火，陣地漸向右翼移動，惟因艦砲射程甚遠，仍難逃出我熾烈火綱。吳淞要塞區現安如磐石，此一大上海吞吐口決無問題。</p>
<p>又訊：此次參加保衛大上海之海軍艦艇，士氣極為旺盛，其中有多艘係在長江保衛戰中迭著戰功者，例如永嘉艦卽曾在安慶江面協向陸軍痛殲頭匪數萬人，突圍來滬時沿途砲擊匪軍，均將匪軍砲火制壓，卒能安然通過。其他各艦，亦多類似，故官兵對於保衛大上海戰爭之任務無不異常興奮。</p>
<h3>空軍續予共軍重創　周至柔親飛前綫指揮作戰</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據空總部息：上海保衛戰今（十五日）為第三日，共軍不僅置重兵爭奪吳淞口外圍月浦·楊行·劉行等要地，復由大上海之西南嘉興松江等地，密集其部隊，向上海移動，再由黃浦江以東之奉賢·南匯向川沙進撲。我陸海空三軍喋血奮勇抵抗，激戰終日，在大上海週團酷烈進行，尤以月浦·楊行·劉行一帶為最，空軍仍再接再厲，整日廿四小時在大上海外圍上空出擊，計獲戰果如次：</p>
<p>（一）羅店到楊行·劉行問，共軍壕溝增多，約有共軍萬名，匿伏其間，伺機向我陣地撲進，經空軍整日在空壓制監視，每當其行動時卽予炸射，計今（十五日）在羅店·楊行·劉行三角地區炸斃共軍二千餘人，午前十一時並助我坦克車隊摧毀劉行附近共軍陣地三處。</p>
<p>（二）新鎭共軍砲兵陣地甚多，整日由我機制壓，將其砲陣炸毀七處，幾使其砲陣全部歸於寂滅。新鎭到劉行之間，共軍工事亦經轟炸，使此處共軍死傷達二千餘名。</p>
<p>（三）在南匯東一公里，發現共軍二千餘名，乍浦發現共軍千餘，計各斃傷其四百餘名。</p>
<p>（四）嘉興松江一帶，向上海行進之共軍二萬餘名，其先頭抵達陳家沙，經炸斃其二千餘名。</p>
<p>（五）空軍總司令周至柔，今（十五日）上午九時携同參謀陳希劍，親飛羅店·月浦·獅子林·劉行·松江，以迄浦東川沙·南匯等前綫上空視察，歷二小時，並指揮當時出擊之飛機對共軍攻擊。</p>
<h3>谷正綱雷震方治　昨續赴前綫慰勞</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕昨為大上海保衛戰第三日，由於英勇之海陸空軍密切配合，連日戰果良好。此間之百萬市民，咸以興奮之心情，傾聞捷報，京滬杭警備總部政務委員谷正綱，雷震，方治三氏，昨以無限之熱情和敬意，慰勞堅守陣地之英勇將士。三氏於昨下午三時親携慰勞品赴陸軍裝甲車兵團司令部慰勞，並致敬意，徐庭瑤司令與蔣緯國副司令在前綫指揮作戰，由司令部政工處長陳守成迎見，對三氏親往慰勞極為感奮，並以堅定之態度報告連日戰况，渠表示裝甲兵團全體官兵在保衛大上海戰役中，決以全力發揮優良戰果，消滅匪軍，渠指出裝甲兵團每一個馳赴陣地之官兵咸有必勝之信念，戰鬥意志尤為堅決。歡談約二十分鐘告辭。聞三氏今日將續往前綫慰勞。</p>

<h3>北平和平眞像　（續昨）</h3>
<p>（四）天津激戰</p>
<p>自北平被圍後，共黨卽對天津作「試探性的攻擊」，國軍在天津集結的兵力，雖然只有兩軍，惟戰鬥力都很强，但終以衆寡懸殊太甚，故防守圈越來越小，打得最利害的日子，要算一月十二日，十三日，十四日三天了。據事後由津去平的友人談：自十二日下午起，砲聲已較機關槍聲還密，震耳欲聾的聲音，像暑天霹雷一樣，連續不斷的響成一片，設以「隆隆不絕」四字描寫，已嫌太不够用。這種激戰，一直延續到十五日拂曉，天津本無城牆，國軍祇是據壕苦守，事後北平軍事上的朋友，批評天津防守者的國軍眞强，而攻擊者的共軍也眞勇。綜計此戰，共方自己承認死傷五萬餘人，實際上一定還不止此數，最後共軍是由西營門衝進去的，那時該地　溝已被往前衝被打死的共軍屍體塡滿，攻擊者得以踏屍而過，於是天津遂陷但請。天津的同鄉們放心，天津的攻防戰雖然這麼激烈，但市內破壞得還不算太慘，先說普通市民，據報紙公布者，前綫統計，死傷至多不過四五百人，再說到建築物，被砲火轟燬者只有東局子，西營門，西南城角的趙家大街，奮日租界的正中書局，支化會堂一帶，舊法租界的五洲藥房一帶，河東三馬路及北站附近，其餘大致完好。共軍進城以後，第一個措施是先把中正路改為解放路，把各首要份子請入「貴賓營」，據說杜建時於十三日晚已化裝避入利華大樓美國領事館內，因為他的貼身勤務就是共產黨員，共軍進城後，給他告了密，故他於十九日才被　着，警備司令陳長　，一直到共軍衝入，還全身披抖，左臂帶滿了勛章，坐定在警備司令部他的辦公椅上，以電話指揮軍事，共軍因憤於死在他指揮下人數太多，恨他入骨，故獨將他與林偉　等頭號戰犯，關在警備司令部內。市政府秘書長梁子靑，因兼了一名市黨部主任委員，被譽為特務頭子，報上宣布要等人民公軍，拘地不詳。奔走天津局部和平最力的市參議會議長楊亦周，也被躺入「貴賓館」，至於被俘的國軍官兵呢，則照下列方式處理，（一）軍官全送東北受訓，認為思想轉變後，卽還送國籍令作比較，（二）老弱殘兵則視路程遠近，每人發給若干路費，並發還故證一枚令憑以在共軍區通行，並可搭乘火車自回原籍。（三）年輕力壯的兵，則一編入解放律軍，補充作戰時的傷亡，絕對不許回籍。天津易手後，全市大小十九家報紙均被對門，軍管會把天津民國日報接收，請毛澤東盃七扭八的題了個眉，出了一份天律日報，內容與其他共黨機關報一樣作風，只重文告及宣傳辭令，不重新聞，但因先天條件好，印刷得還很講究，圖畫及照片很多，每日出一大張，星期六出兩大張，比抗戰時在重慶出的新華日報神氣多　　了，別的都死心塌地的被對了，只有天津益世報，直到共黨把「宗敎自由」喊得震天價響，且有羅馬敎廷的關係，曾三請復刋，但終未置理，天津大公報一般認為他的言論態度是一秉大公，且中間偏左，尤其是在共黨新聞界紅得發紫的范長江就出身該報，現在該報駐北平的徐盈，彭天岡與共黨又是自家人，也曾利用各種方式活動復刊，但結果仍等於零，後來天津軍管會當局將他改名進步日報出刊，不知確否，新華報社廣播，並且將大公報做軍閥及政學系走狗的歷史痛駡了一頓，其他措施，大致跟北平差不多，容後再叙。至於塘沽，則於天津易手後兩天，守軍上兵艦，全軍而退，已為衆所週知，不再贅述。現在天津偽軍管會主委黃克誠，偽市長是黃敬，偽副市長是張友漁。</p>
<p>（五）北平醞釀</p>
<p>北平和平醞釀，可分兩方來說，一是社會方面，一是軍事方面，茲引述之：</p>
<p>社會方面的醞釀和平，如以時間為序，最先創導的要算張蔭梧了，在圍城之初，任何人沒敢公開倡和的時候，他就在華北廿九省市國大代表聯誼會中一鳴驚人，發表他必須立卽求和的高論，當時爭執得很激烈，與會的一部代表，竟因此而拍案退席，此情此景，卅七年十二月中旬的各地報紙均有登載，不再贅述，此後他繼續努力，每會必到，逢和必主，我想任何人寫北平局部和平史時，也必把他老先生的大名寫在第一頁，其次就是許惠東，他是北平市參議會議長，圍城前後，更聯絡冀晋熱察綏津六單位的參議會留平負責人，組成七省市參議會聯合會，圍城不久，卽響應張蔭梧等的設法，頻頻在市參議會內召開各界和平運動會，奔走之勤，任人皆知，詳情均有園城時期的北平報紙可按，無庸多述。最後敲開和平之門的，要算何思源了，何氏原任北平市長，交卸後作了一名北平榮譽市民，圍城之初，他彷彿還在上海，回平的日期，大槪就在我回平的前一兩天，下機後對記者講，他專為奔走和平而來，因此他就終日出入中南海，來往於市參議會，最後並率十代表出城，風塵僕僕，力竭聲嘶，後來他的錫拉胡問九號的住宅飲挨了幾腦胞彈，女兒何鮑災死亡，太太受了候傷，他自己傷臂，鈇會方面的和平醞釀，自臘城起到一月中旬止，經張·許·何的努力，總算成熟了。人類到了最危險的時候，本能上先求不死，至於不死以後的生活方式，那就是問題了。故此時唱反調者已無，十位和平代表彷彿是十七號出城的（日期記不太淸），代表的構成份子是何思源領銜，其餘彷彿有立法委員呂復，晨會代表郭樹棠，商會代表劉鴻瑞，婦女代表康同壁等，十六日晚先以無綫電廣播與共方聯絡，約定次早九時出西直門到海甸，與葉劍英見面，十七日絕早，十代表將齊集於市參議會了，因傅先生猶疑不決，拖到下午三點才得出發，他們十們人共坐一部大汽車，車前揷了一面上寫華北人民和平代表團的大白旗，載着這十位捉緊心弦的代表，小心翼翼地出兩直門了。快到萬牲園時，前面鳴槍喝止，上來了兩個沒有帽徽的軍人盤詰，幷責以誤時後，就上車引導西進，及過萬牲園北，拐到白石橋時，前面又有亂槍射來，引導者站車外大呼「同志們別打，人家都投降來了，你們還打甚麼？」此後卽順利北上，再無阻撓，到海甸後，這十位代表被招待在東後頭謝宅，房子很闊綽，葉劍英沒有見面，據說葉等了一上午沒等到，因急事到天津去了，由一位姓黃的代見，這黃先生極富勝利者的優越感，在談話中間，代表們提起中央來，他偏裝作不懂，必令稱之為偽中央，談到總統一辭，他便裝作不知，必令名之為蔣介石。（未　　完待續）</p>
<h3>國軍奉令作戰略轉進　武漢成眞空狀態　華中長官署遷衡長沙成立指揮所　白崇禧昨乘機飛抵長</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢口十五日電〕武漢國軍十五日奉命作戰略轉進，守備司令魯適源，於下午七時發表書面談話稱：「本部奉命守備武漢，兩月以來，承地方父老恊助得收圓滿效果，無任感戴，匪軍來犯，均經擊退，現本部奉命作戰略轉進，武漢放棄，臨別在卽，不勝依依，今後地方治安，由警察機關及人民自衛總隊負責，尙望各安生業，勿自驚恐，」現守備武漢之五十八軍及警備部除已撤退完畢，全市成眞空狀態，防護團及消防警察維護治安，市內尙平靜，各報仍照常出版。</p>

<h3>閻錫山等地發起　反共救國運動　定期成立反侵略機構</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十五日電〕共軍渡江後，氣燄日益高漲，廣州各界人士認為，反共救國，實為當前急務，此種工作，幷非單純政府或某一黨派之事，而為全體國民所應努力者，因此，十五日下午四時，閻錫山，鄒魯，李文範，吳鐵城，朱家驊，陳立夫，馬超俊，陳啓天，余家菊，蔣勻田，萬鴻圖，夏　聲等發起，假文德路留德學會舉行茶會，討論如何展開反共工作，到會者五十餘人，公推閻錫山主席，報告開會意義，略謂：自和談破裂後，共黨積極向華中進攻，足證其有赤化中國，赤化東亞的野心，在此種情形下，中國人民悉須加强團結並聯合東亞各國人民，組織反侵略陣綫，予共黨以有力之打擊，粉碎其侵略企圖，國內各黨各派以及無黨派人士，亟應先有反侵略的組織，進而為反侵略的運動，以有組織有力量的做法，聯合世界上反侵略國家，制止共黨的侵略行動，如認此種意見為必要，卽可發起組織反侵略機構，共謀進展。繼由陳啓天，萬嗚圖，錢稱，余家藥，張其昀，陳可忠，張道藩，余凌雲，池正，蕭錚，黃鍾等發言，大意對於反共組織及運動，均認為目前急切需要，應早日成立，並與國際反侵略爭自由之人士取得密切聯繫，以達到國家獨立，政治民主，經濟平等，生活自由，共謀世界和平之確保。最後決定後列數點：一凡參加本日談話會者，均為發起人。二組織及綱領，推定閻鍚山·陳啓天·馬超俊·萬鴻圖·張其昀·錢種·程天放·谷正鼎·袁謙·高信·楊公達·蔣勻田·王師會等十三人擬定組織名稱及綱領章程，由閻錫山召集。三定十九日下午四時開發起人第二次會議，決定名稱及綱領，廿二日開成立大會，綱領確定後，卽發表宣言，積極推進反共救國工作。</p>
<p>〔聯合社廣州十五日電〕閻錫山氏今日答復外國記者稱，蔣總裁並未被邀來粵領導政府或國民黨·國民黨中央委員會對於此事絕未作何決定，余亦並未被邀担任政府任何職位，本人對於此事亦絕未加以攷慮。</p>
<h3>閩北佈置周密　南平福州間電訊恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報福州十五日電〕朱紹良偕黃珍吾昨赴古田佈署，當日返榕，並卽主持綏署重要會議，對閩北局勢之安靖已有所決定。榕戒嚴司令部發言人宣稱：國軍已有佈置，榕市治安無虞，希市民鎭靜，勿聽信謠言，自亂步驟。據古田十四日來人語記者，該地有大軍駐守，縣府日夜忙於軍差供應，唯駐軍紀律頗好，一切均極正常。來人係經谷口改由劍溪水路來榕者，谷口情况亦穩。至建甌以北情勢，亦不如此間謠諑之嚴重。又，南平電訊於十五日午後恢復，國軍復將該地控制，當局以運日閩北情况因電訊欠通，頓使後方騷動，綏署已派出無綫電通信隊若干，俾在各地發出確實情報，以免謠言風傳，搖憾人心。</p>
<h3>流亡學生簽名從軍</h3>
<p>孫立人表示歡迎</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十五日電〕戰區大中學生因目睹共匪之殘酷，不堪蹂躪，相偕作爭取「自由生活方式」之流亡，抵穗後，雖經敎育部分別介紹學校寄讀，惟因大局動盪，不能安心研讀，紛紛向敎育部請求從軍，經杭部長電商陸軍訓練總司令孫立人，據電覆稱：「對於能吃苦耐勞與富愛國熱情之靑年投効，表示歡迎，各生開之，甚為興奮，現已自行簽名者達三百餘人，個別流亡來穗尙未入校之大中學生，亦踴躍參加，正簽名造册，送請廣州靑年輔導處，代為集體辦理報名手續。頃悉：輔導處定十六日起會同陸軍訓練司令部入伍生團在穗招致人員，在中山紀念堂辦理登記，聞河南五鳳府敎育部靑年輔導會第二臨時招待站現住之五百餘人流亡學生，幾已全數簽名從軍，靑年輔導會已允將談接待站借予陸軍訓練部入伍生團，作為臨時收容站，凡在該站寄住學生，不日卽可由入伍生團派員發給服裝，辦理膳食，並定最短期內搭專輪赴台。</p>

<h3>香港人心略定　股票價格回挺</h3>
<p>對華北出口商多賠本</p>
<p>〔中央社香港十五日電〕英當局表示保衛香港後，港人心略定，物業股份價復趨漲，繁盛商業區物業比過去兩週間漲百分之六十，住宅區漲百分之十，一週來因人心冷淡而交易轉疏之股票市塲，週末突轉旺盛，各種股票均從低價回挺，公共事業股票成交最多，上週股票交易統計一二一一九九股，市值二百六十餘萬元，由於港幣大量回籠，及出口窒息關係，港一般商業皆告冷淡，對華北貿易雖已復通，但因受種種條件限制，出口商多告賠本，港商塲雖冷淡，惟貨價仍不低落，糧食則因來源困難及人口增加，且告劇漲，自由市塲上米批價每担八十四元，肉類亦比月前漲百分之三十左右，金價仍挺，但鑽石市價較去年底加百分之卅。</p>
<h3>對美停止日賠償計劃　顧大使將發聲明　駐日代表團人員將裁减</h3>

<h3>社論　地攤的興起與工商業</h3>
<p>這幾天的馬路上，兩旁鱗次　比的排着地攤。平日淸靜的幾條路上，也是人聲嘈雜；熱鬧地區，更是擁擠萬分。蕭條的市容，點綴了畸形的繁榮。地攤上出售的貨物，大都是日用品；而地攤的主人，又都屬於工商業的小職員。乍看果然很熱鬧，但看的人多，買的人少；儘管價廉物美，但問津者總是寥寥無幾，這充分顯示出上海工商業的衰落，已瀕於破產的邊緣。</p>
<p>自和談破裂戰火再起以來，上海的經濟情形，也隨着軍事形勢的劇變，而益趨惡化。由於戰爭的關係，海上運輸北洋綫和長江綫也已停駛，以致一般美製品，外銷無路，存貨堆積如山，資金不能週轉，乃陷於停頓狀態。同時一般人因購買力的低落，商店門可　雀，甚至一天沒有一筆交易的。在這種情形下，工商業當然難以維持，但是要關門，却又無力遣散職工。於是把銷不出去的貨品，分發與職工作為遣散費。職工們為維持日常生活，分得的貨品急於變現，這種原始時代市集式的地攤，就應運而生了。</p>
<p>地攤的營業，會影響到正當的商店，對於工商業，更是「雪上加霜」。同時，商店的營業，須向主管機關登記，並須納稅，地攤中擺設，毋需這種手續，會影響到稅收。惟這項攤販，與過去的攤販性質不同，由於工商業的面臨困境，無法維持，不得已以製成的貨品，分發與職工，職工變現後以維持生活。這是最後一批以勞力汗血換得的代價，暫以度過目前的日子，賣光吃光以後，再如何生活？實無法可以想像了。這種境况，這樣掙扎，殊屬可憫，當然不能遽然加以取締。</p>
<p>但在交通要道五步一攤，十步一集，到處擠滿了人。使行人感到極度的困難，大有「行不得」之感，因此市政當局不得不出面干涉，對於攤販營業的地區予以限制，規定下列十一處：（一）北京路；（二）南京路；（三）福州路；（四）中正東路；（五）金陵路；（六）林森東路；（七）外灘自外白渡橋起至十六舖；（八）四川路；（九）江西路；（十）福建路；（十）（一）浙江路，不得設地攤營業。這是沒有辦法的辦法，攤販自應遵命辦理。</p>
<p>不過指定地區供攤販營業，亦不過是臨時權宜之措施。但這種畸形的熱鬧，究能維持幾許時日：在攤販們貨品賣光吃光後，他們的生活將如何安排。難道眞讓上海的工商業，走上絕路嗎？難道讓這幾百萬賴以維持生活的職工們，陷於失業的命運嗎？解救目前工商業的危機，已是刻不容緩的事。主要的是疏導工業製品的出路，俾資金得以週轉，廠商得以維持，職工們也免於失業。這固然有待政府切實的扶持，還要各有關機關的協助，以渡過目前的難關。</p>
<p>其實，這種困難的遭遇，不僅是上海的工商業，就是一般的小市民，更加不得了。祗要看地攤上的貨品，便宜得不能再便宜，但是買的人仍是鳳毛麟角。要之地攤的風起雲湧，是當前最嚴重的社會問題，對工商業血言，可謂「飲鳩出竭」，對於正當的工商業，有害無益；對於社會而論，更是一個嚴重的問題，顯示出上海的社會，已到了極嚴重的階段了！</p>
<h3>海鹽上海道上</h3>
<p>— 綠洲</p>
<p>杭州撤失後，筆者卽伴老母及同時逃出之難民十數人乘船離杭，歷四日而抵達海鹽。</p>
<p>懷着一種流浪的心情上了岸，才知道梅鹽四郊並無國軍駐防，在安吉孝豐激戰的時侯，這裏就已呈糾空狀態，沒有國軍也沒有共軍，市面僅由少數地方組織的「保甲聯轄隊」維持治安，倒甚少有搶案等事發生。街頭異常蕭條，金圓券已絕跡，市民均以銀圓銅　幣為交易的通貨，僅有的三四家報館物已停業，僅餘一份四開的海鹽地方報。</p>
<p>五月五日黎明後，氣候轉陰，晨間九時許卽細雨紛飛，筆者打聽得有獨輪板車可通離平湖五十里許的羊角鎭，卽伴老母以大頭五圓，外加八九分重的金挖耳一很的代價，僱車一輛往該鎭，沿滬杭公路而行，途中車輪軋軋，野田烟雨，別是一番滋味。</p>
<p>午後二時半，車抵劉村，卽與車夫同進村覓店打尖，進村時突遇不明番號的土共四人，見余等卽攔車盤查，有一人上前奪余手提箱開視，見印有國旗的地理書籍，卽行撕毀，並用江蘇土音間余何來，經余一再聲明，並出示杭州身份證及證件，方允進村。進村後，見村內小街上停小型山砲兩門，方悉共軍已佔領該村，村內情形甚悽淸，僅少數村民帮助共軍搬運物件。</p>
<p>飯後重行上路，離村約兩里許，又遇共軍盤查哨一小隊，約十二三人，見余後，僅稍加詢問卽放行。</p>
<p>入晚抵羊角鎭，鎭內並無共軍，當晚雨住月出，假宿一極小之客棧內。次日天氣轉晴，氣候甚熱。乃又另僱一雙輪牛板車往平湖出發，牛行甚慢，且沿途公路均遭炸毀，必須另灣小道而行，惟情况尙安靖。午後三時許抵平湖。平湖並未被共軍佔領，然市面甚混亂，銀牛手中之大頭已無人問津，米價狂跌，店舖多數關閉，街頭僅少數自衛隊及保安員警維特治安。筆者聞次日晨有早班汽車至松江，乃伴母至車站夜宿。</p>
<p>七日晨六時，連續有七班車開至松江，然擁擠的情形實屬罕見，經余一再與司機磋商，並允另以大頭四枚為報酬，方允老母坐入司機之側，九時車方開出，至奉賢·柘林·亭林·金山，均被沿途軍警攔阻搜查，躭擱至晚方抵松江，下車卽開平湖撤失，同車者均額手稱幸。</p>
<p>八日晨乘火車至上海，車抵龍華卽停止不開，經探詢方知又是軍警檢查，此次檢查甚嚴，無滬市民身份證者不得下車，筆者亦不能免，後經余出示證件，並打電話請滬市某報館友人錢君證明方允下車，乃又乘汽車抵上海。（十四日於上海）</p>
<h3>某國外交人員　大談中蘇關係　謂蘇聯援助中共有確切證據</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十五日電〕此間中央日報今載紐約六日航訊謂：紐約盛傳英出席聯合國之代表團已獲得蘇聯援助中國共產黨之充分證據，此我國可向聯合國控訴蘇聯，而使世人明瞭中國反共戰爭非為一個國家之內戰，而為國際性之戰爭。此消息披露後，中國代表團曾奉政府訓令，向英國代表團詢問眞相，各通訊社記者亦大為活動，紛紛刺探內容。惟英國代表團為某種外交理由，迄不願公開宣布，甚至對中國代表國之詢問亦僅以含糊籠統之辭答覆，因公布時機尙未成熟，故不得不採取此種態度。記者在此與某國外交人員頗有來往，日昨於雞尾酒會後，此外交人員與高彩烈，大談其中蘇關係，記者從彼口中獲悉英國代表團所獲得之證據，包括關於下列各事之秘密文件或照片：（一）一九四五年九月蘇聯應中共之請，拒絕中國軍隊在大連·旅順登陸以接收東北。（二）根據中蘇友好條約，蘇聯應於一九四五年十二月三日以前，將佔領東北之蘇軍全部撤退，乃蘇聯為便於將東北移交中共接管計，延至一九四六年五月始行撤軍。（三）蘇聯在東北獲得日本關東軍七十萬人之武器除將重砲及大型坦克等運往蘇聯本國外，其餘武器如步槍，機關槍，迫擊砲及小型坦克等，悉數交給中共，因此，中共徒手士兵由華北進入東北後，立卽取得裝配，成為戰鬥力堅强之隊伍。（四）一九四六年蘇聯派人李立三返國時曾派高級軍官數遣同至哈爾濱，充林彪之軍事顧問，此後一切對國軍作戰計劃，均由蘇聯顧問製定。（五）一九四六年以後，在山東之中共軍隊不斷由大連·旅順取得武器彈藥之補充，以與國軍作戰。（六）中共奪獲國軍重砲後，無人能使用，乃由蘇聯派遣砲兵軍官來華指揮。（七）中共盤踞東北後，卽與蘇聯訂立密約，以東北出產之鋼鐵及大豆等供給蘇聯，暫以十年為期。（八）南斯拉夫狄托元帥，因不堪蘇聯之壓迫，起而反抗，謀爭取南國之獨立，莫斯科卽命令全世界共產黨一致譴責狄托，中共亦奉命維謹。（九）今年三月在蘇聯監督之下，中共與韓共代表在莫斯科訂一互助密約，中共卽以此密約取得韓共軍事上之協助。（十）最近美加英法意等十二國訂立北大西洋安全公約，以抵制蘇聯之侵略政策，蘇聯甚為畏懼，乃由斯科訓令全世界共產黨發表聲明，攻擊北大西洋公約，並聲稱將一致保衛蘇聯，抵抗英美，毛澤東奉到訓令後，卽於四月四日發表廣播辭，聲稱：中共將領導中國人民為蘇聯而作戰，以上所列之十點，均為確切有據之事實，可以證明中國共產黨與蘇聯暗中勾結，以進行其刧奪中國政權之眞相。</p>

<p>印度指控南非歧視印人案，今夜由各代表以西四十七對一票（南非）及十票棄權，通過決議案，請南非·印度及巴基斯坦舉行圓桌會議，此為一折衷行動。在上兩次大會中，各代表曾指責南非之對待印人，係違反基本人權。大會主席澳外長伊伐特於表決此案後宣稱，大會尚有要案討論，如無人反對，當延會至星期一晨。疲倦之代表均鼓掌贊成。大會結束日期，當視其能否迅速解決西班牙及義大利殖民地兩問題而定。要求發言之人甚多，恐非至星期二不能表決。拉丁美洲國家提議與西班牙完全復交，此案能否通過為一疑問，贊成與反對兩方皆自稱可獲勝利。義殖民地分配代管辦法已由政委會表決。</p>
<h3>美對西貸款　不久即可宣佈</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕星期泰晤士報載巴塞隆納來專電稱，外交界可靠方面息，美國對西班牙之貸款，不久即可宣佈。</p>
<h3>反對分割里比亞　阿拉伯人大示威</h3>
<p>〔聯合社里比亞區特利波里港十五日電〕此間阿拉伯人今日舉行示威，反對聯大討論分割里比亞殖民地。當場發生意外事端數起，當局立即宣佈戒嚴及實施宵禁。</p>
<h3>法總統演說</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社里昂十五日電〕法國總統歐體和今日在此間演說稱，國際間之和平，與一國之統一相同，必須建立於尊重個人及公共自由，尊重人類間與國家間之公理，尊重各人民及其傳統與政體之基礎上。簡言之，必須聯合各個自主之國家，以確保每一個人之安全獨立及繁榮。</p>
<h3>蘇聯錳鉻礦產　對美輸出減少</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕蘇聯重要原料錳與鉻之對美輸出日益減少，一部份人相信蘇聯欲強迫美國放寬對蘇貨物輸出之限制。美國正積儲錳與鉻，以備戰時應用。據統計局宣佈，三月份輸入之錳與鉻，價值僅六十萬元，較二月份跌落百分之五十以上，僅及一九四八年同期三分之一。</p>
<h3>澳總理呼籲　締太平洋公約</h3>
<p>美軍人協會提同樣主張</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社杜康十五日電〕澳總理齊夫萊今日在此向全澳廣播時提出成立一太平洋公約，以輔助大西洋公約確保區域安全之需要。齊氏稱：「欲成立太平洋區之共同防衛公約，則應由英澳及紐西蘭首先獲得協議，然後加入美國，再加上其他在太平洋有領土之國家。至於此項公約之計劃，則可按大西洋公約擬成之」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕美國參議軍人協會，今日籲請參議院外交委員會，立即考慮太平洋條約，一如北大西洋條約。據會長紐貢白在該會稱，太平洋各國對於對立區域防務制度，其貢獻殆不若歐洲各國之多，但吾人應認識太平洋對面某侵略國之推進，最後必使美國不得不再度為自由而戰爭，美國必須抱定堅決政策，以防再度發生戰禍。</p>
<h3>美廿五參議員一致贊成　組織國際志願軍　防止歐洲任何武裝攻擊</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十四日電〕共和黨新參議員兩人頃建議成立一枝國際志願軍，以協助保持歐洲之和平。該兩參議員一為墨特脫一為漢特力克生。墨漢兩人稱：此項軍隊足可緩和歐洲之任何武裝攻擊，及符合大西洋公約。墨氏曾拜訪國務部探詢談判締結亞洲及近觀東防務條約作為大西洋條約之補充。成立一支國際志願軍之建議，由克勃遜在參院外交關係委員會中提出者。據克氏稱：此項志願軍由較小國家之志願者組成，駐紮於多事之地，諸如西德，該軍由大西洋締約國大多數代表組織之防衛機構控制之。克氏又稱：迄今已有廿五個參議員贊成其計劃，該計劃并主張取消聯合國之否決權。據漢特力克稱：克氏之建議，可使聯合國及大西洋公約成為保持和平之有效工具。墨氏稱：渠對克氏之計劃極感興趣。墨氏并提出其他加強大西洋公約及聯合國之方法如下：</p>
<p>成立亞洲公約　中國包括在內</p>
<p>（一）成立亞洲及近東公約與大西洋條約或其他條約連接，或擴大大西洋公約之基礎，包括「非共產國家」如西班牙，中國國民政府或以色列在內。（二）由美國領導，召開全聯合國會議，包括蘇聯在內，以覓取取消否決權協定，控制原子彈及其他集體殺人武器之協定。墨氏稱：此項協定如無蘇聯參加亦可能成立。墨氏之擴大地區條約建議，與顧維鈞，澳洲，紐西蘭，及其他國家政治家所發表之意見相同。</p>
<p>尼赫魯認為時機未成熟</p>
<p>反之，印度總理尼赫魯則認為締結與大西洋公約之太平洋公約，時機尚未成熟。尼氏認為許多東方國家之政府及經濟狀況不安定，將消除簽訂一項團結與有效聯盟之可能性。美官員并未除開將來在美國協助下締訂太平洋公洋之可能性，但傳彼等對於在最近將來情況將否有利，殊表懷疑。美官員多有同意尼氏之見解者。彼等不願考慮或建議美國之參加任何此項公約，除非有公約所基之更健全基礎。美官員認為亞洲情況與歐洲相差甚多。在歐洲，大西洋公約簽約國似已達到政府與經濟發展之同樣階段，并有相輔之經濟。反之，許多遠東國家并不互相貿易，反與西方國家貿易。此外，若干亞洲國家仍為受外來統治之非自治區，許多美官員認為此點將使區域性聯盟之締結更為複雜。</p>
<h3>美願亞洲各國　組太平洋公約</h3>
<p>此等援助美將予以考慮</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十五日電〕美官員等認為，亞洲國家須不需外來鼓勵之激動，而由彼等本身決定彼等是否需要與大西洋公約相仿之太平洋公約，及彼等能否獲致公約所基之健全基礎。亞洲國家如能對太平洋公約之必要性獲致協議，如能獲致美政府認為必要基礎之初步經濟全作，則美政府將對任何「差數援助」之要求予以同情之考慮。普遍說來，此為美官員曾告要求美國參加此公約之各東方國家代表者。最近要求成立東方聯盟者為中國大使顧維鈞，渠曾於十一日向國務卿艾契遜建議及此。在提出同樣建議之人中，尚有菲律賓與澳洲代表等。</p>
<h3>美軍事援外計劃　國務院發表小冊說明四點</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕國務院今日發表小冊，題曰「建立和平，美國軍事援助計劃」。其中聲明美國對西歐的軍事援助，將繼續進行直待第三次世界大戰的一切威脅完全移除為止。小冊內并指出一九五〇年度之軍事援助計劃，尚有賴於下列四點之決定：</p>
<p>（一）除希臘外，建議的援助，大多為重配備，在承平時間亦可保持多年。（二）歐洲受援國軍隊的增加，應受經濟復興的限制。（三）西歐自給能力和增加。（四）戰爭威脅可能移除的程度。一九五〇年度之軍事援助計劃，對大部份國家者估計需十一億三千萬元，對希土及其他安全區者三億二千萬元。總統得權宜使用該款，隨時應付緊急狀態。援助的方式計分三種：（一）小額金錢援助，以增加西歐軍事生產力。（二）直接供應武器配備，（三）美國供應技術及訓練援助。</p>

<h3>美共黨艾思勒　脫逃至英被捕</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕被美國眾議院非美活動委員會指為「美國第一號」共產黨之德國血統的艾思勒，自美偷搭波蘭郵船巴托利號來英，已於今夜在船上被警察逮捕，現被禁於南安普登盜獄中，將於週一審訊，然後再解倫敦法院，審查美國司法部引渡該人之請求。艾思勒在美會被判徒刑一年及其他刑罰，交保二萬三千五百元在案，不意渠竟偷登輪船逃亡來英，乃由國務院請求英當局於該輪抵英時加以逮捕。波蘭當局原擬保護保護艾思勒，不使被捕，經英當局交涉之下，告以除非交出艾思勒，不然該輪須到星期一下午五時待該事解決後，如能離南安普登，繼續駛往波蘭，波當局乃不得不屈服。波蘭大使館以艾思勒係在波蘭船上為理由，向英抗議艾思勒之被捕，然當英警登輪執行拘捕時，然當英警登輪執行拘捕時，該輪船長及波蘭外交官均未干涉，僅艾思勒本人曾掙扎抵抗，卒由警士四人挾登小輪登岸，波蘭大使館官員表示在與華沙方面接洽前，大使館不擬發表任何聲明。蔣思勒之逮捕狀，係根據一八七〇年引渡法案簽發，由蘇格蘭聲探長勃萊執行。同往者尚有美大使館參贊凡利德，美駐南安普登領事貝克，及波蘭大使館及領事館之代表，諸人先至船長室附近之一艙內，將獨坐在酒吧間內之艾思勒帶到該處，室外由警士把守，室內當即展開談判，由波大使館之潘基及波副領事齊姆萊夫斯基與勃萊交涉達三小時之久，然後兩波代表暨勃萊乃下輪登岸，紛向波使館及內政部請示，至下午六時，勃萊獲得逮捕狀後，乃重新登輪執行逮捕。</p>

<h3>埃及極端派首領　馬里克被捕</h3>
<p>〔路透社開羅十五日電〕被指為去年十二月暗殺埃總理諾克拉許之指使者馬里克，已於今日在亞歷山大港外之法華爾島上被捕。當大批警探包圍該屋時，雙力發生槍戰半小時。馬里克被執時雙手猶執冒煙之手槍兩柄。渠年輕美貌，據云，即為回教弟兄會之領袖。</p>
<h3>又一超級重巡洋艦完工　正式編入美艦隊　裝有五十三尊大砲威力無比</h3>
<p>〔路透社波斯頓十四日電〕美國第三艘超級重洋艦一萬七千噸之「沙倫」號，已於今日編隊。按此艦與「蒙尼斯」號及「新堡」號為同級。美海軍軍令部長鄧斐爾稱，該艦為美國決不使侵略者危害美國人民生活方式的明顯表示。任何敵人一睹該艦之配備，必將三思而後行動。該艦射擊速率較美國戰時巡洋艦超過四倍，其五十三尊大砲可以對任何敵方飛機船舶瞄準射擊。「沙倫」號裝有八時口徑自動砲九尊，分列於三座砲塔，此外尚有最新式自動砲及高射砲等，該艦速率每小時逾卅浬。</p>
<h3>聯合國全體大會通過　新聞自由公約　蘇代表猛烈反對終屬無效</h3>
<p>〔路透社弗魯辛草原十四日電〕聯合國全體大會已於今日通過「新聞自由公約」美代表格蘭稱之為「歷史上的第一次嘗試將收集及傳遞新聞的憲草，訂入國際法內」本約內規定一項國際糾正權，如一國認為在國外所發表關於該國之消息係屬不確，偽造，或足以損害其與他國之關係時，得將正確消息交該發表國發表。如該國不予發表，得交聯合國秘書處之新聞機構發表。</p>
<p>公約內容包含在法律上具有拘束效力的條文廿三條，主要者在保證新聞記者行動的自由，及採訪的平等權利；及禁止於承平時期，除非有關國防者外，實施新聞檢查。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表葛羅米柯於聯大委員會及聯大全體會辯論該約時，均施猛烈抨擊，指之為加強西方新聞事業獨佔者之力量，以加緊對蘇聯及其他斯拉夫國實施誹謗宣傳。渠發表歷時一小時之演說，指該約之作者，意在取得機會以伸入他國，散佈引起歇斯底裡的新聞。受該約之利者，衹是最傑著的黷武份子與戰販們。美英法義的報紙已以散佈關於蘇聯的謊言為其職業。他們希望他國開門容納他們的用新聞記者作幌子的代表，收集種種情報，供美英諜報部之用，這一公約不在加強反法西斯或禁止戰敗宣傳，反在給予「蒲立德系」及「福萊斯泰系」的人以自由。</p>
<h3>美國政黨與政治</h3>
<p>— 尼文斯作</p>
<p>雖然美國的政黨歷史，與美國政府的一般久遠，以地方·州·與全國各代表大會為活動樞紐的黨的全國·州·與地方組織的巨大機構的存在，還是傑克遜總統二度連任時開始的事情（一八二九—三七）。充分發展的黨的活動，特別是兩黨制度，在美國人說起來還不過一百年的歷史。</p>
<p>政黨有健全的作用嗎？華盛頓時代有些主要領袖并不以為然。他們認為黨派只足以引起分裂，并形成意見不合。新的共和國的善良的公民應該棄絕黨派，這種見解起源於一種良好的羅馬精神。這種見解以後見諸於麥考萊的詩：「當時沒有人擁戴一個黨，當時人人都擁戴國家。」華盛頓的被一致擁戴為美國總統，似乎足以證明這種理想。</p>
<p>但是由（美國第三任總統傑斐遜）在一個嚴正的文告內描述過的事實，截破了這種烏托邦式的理論。政黨實為表示政見，教育人民，推行施政與批評政府所必要。傑斐遜說過政黨對自由極關重要，他的話很簡單：「要任何自由與有討論的社會裏，按人的本性，一定有反對的派別，激烈的異議與意見不合；而其中之一，一定佔得一個或長或短的時期的優勢。也許這種黨派的分歧，為行施相互監視并為人民詳述他方作為所必要。</p>
<p>美國最初的黨派—聯邦黨員共和黨的分立，猶同大不列顛的兩黨先例，是不可避免的。華盛頓在選擇他第一個內閣時，即承認兩黨。在全國的與貴族的方面，他選擇了漢彌敦當財政部長，諾克斯當陸軍部長，在民主人士中他選擇了傑斐遜當國務卿，倫道夫當檢察長。內閣會議中意見的分歧，也許還不及其國內更為分歧的意見。幾年以後，兩黨都經過正式改組，同時每個美國人都知道他們的鬥爭，勢將決定憲法發展的趨向。聯邦黨與共和黨分別竭力爭取使政府按它們的辦法施政，也同惠格與保守黨設法形成不成文的英國憲法的情形一樣。</p>
<p>這裏有一點原則上的分歧。聯邦黨的主要目的在於使憲法條文能擴大聯邦政府的權力。傑斐遜黨的主要目的是使憲法足以限制聯邦政府，而增大地方權力。兩種對抗的思想發生着對面的衝突，可是一開始，就有三個因素，減弱了政黨的激烈性。</p>
<p>它們是什麼呢？（一）原則本身是演繹以保留與修正的有節制的美質，并聽受為權宜之計而發生的驟然變化。因此傑斐遜一旦當權，的確將聯邦政府作了比亞丹斯作過的更廣泛的使用，例如路易斯安那區的購買（一八〇三年由法國購得由墨西哥灣至加拿大邊境的土地，該區以後成立美國中部十四個州），而其時那位良好的民主黨人傑克遜（Jackson）正證明是強大的聯邦政府的堅決倡導者。（二）同黨都注意地着所有各種輔助性的問題，例如關稅，內政改革與外交政策等，當他們如此注意時，兩黨都向經常流動的團體呼籲。（三）每一黨都具有聽求公眾感情的健全的聲譽，因而大多數人無法濫用權力，而少數服從多數，都具有緘默的了解，即不會有濫用權力的事情發生的。</p>
<p>兩黨制度何以存在</p>
<p>由漢彌教一直到今天，兩黨制度的能夠持續有它許多理由。一個是在一個人口眾多的民主國家，每四年要維持一個全國規模的黨，其費用為許多分裂的小黨所無法担負。其次，大部分偉大的領袖，在兩主要黨內抬頭而發生影響。可是最主要的是，兩黨制度合於人民的天才。他們要求一個負責的當局，從而獲致安定；他們要求它由一個強有力的反對黨予以監視；他們要求使用它的力量，但是這事情按妥協的辦法來進行，同時對少數派的權力也予以適當的注意。</p>
<p>這樣的政黨制度民主嗎？在美國內戰之前，民主黨為奴隸主有限制的集團所操縱，這些奴隸主對黨捐錢出力比較任何其他集團為熱心。內戰之後，共和黨有一個很長的時間為大企業所控制，但是黨的機構，經過直接預選會，改善的宣傳，競選捐獻的限制等辦法，已有所改善，因而較為廣泛的控制得以實現。如果還有什麼須予改善的，也可以　得到。各黨內部的龐雜，允許民主的實現。</p>
<p>如果美國歷史上有什麼教訓的話，那就是不民主地控制的黨遲早遭受嚴重處罰。黨員中間會集結叛變的份子，改革的集團起來反對奴隸性的寡頭政治，或大公司，或任何其他起操縱的集團。他們參加了反對黨，「獨立派」實力有如此巨大的參與，以致他們對黨務的更民主的經營起着決定性的推動作用。</p>
<p>這种美國制度很少被人所了解，以致若干批評重覆地提出一個問題：「為什麼我們不能有一個保守黨和一個自由黨呢？這路說法，實在忽略了兩大黨的主要功能。因為，兩大黨是一個混合體而不是一個溶劑。它們在美國的基本價值，乃是將大量的不同社會團體，經濟集團，種族及各地各區的權利集合起來，達成協同管治的目的。</p>
<p>過去美國史上最大災禍的內戰，起因於接地區而形成的暫時的黨派分裂。美國將來能發生的最惡劣的災禍，則將是在經濟和階級上的分裂。美國人民有很多理由，可以感到歡欣而非痛苦，因為民主黨和共和黨如此相像，以致大權從此黨移交另一政黨時，可以不致引起猛烈的震動。</p>
<p>代表人民縱斷面</p>
<p>最重要的是，每一黨都頗能代表全國縱斷面的情形，其中有富人與窮人，農夫與城市中的職員，天主教猶太教和基督教，土著和移民。這在財產中的廣大差異，使富人與窮人不致有任何分裂。但假定美國果真有一個由有財產者組成的保守黨，和一個由無產者組成的急進黨，則最後可以預料得到在選舉中失敗的一方，將在街道上建築起種種障礙物來。</p>
<p>美國式的兩黨制度，也有其明白的缺點。很顯然地，太大太鬆懈而不一致的政黨，是易於引起分裂的。同樣顯然地是，這巨大的政黨既需在各階層之間不斷覓致協議，就不免難於表裏一致。當美國內戰危機甚深的時候，林肯總統於佛萊得烈克斯堡的失敗之後，為了團結共和黨，曾設法取得黨內保守派的寵兒西華德秘書以及急進派的寵兒蔡思秘書的辭職信，以使這兩派可以取得平衡。這是一個很有效的辦法，但不能解釋為最高的政治途徑。</p>
<p>雖然如此，目前現存的制度的利益，是超過它的缺點的。整個的傳統是使政府建築於強大而能負責任的大多數人身上，這多數人將有效地掌握大權，但同時將尊重少數人的權利。美國人認為信託兩大黨之所民比較安全，是由於它們以限制及平衡的手段，保護少數人的權利。他們之所以認為如此比較為安全，是由於即使最強有力的總統——傑克遜·林肯·威爾遜及兩位羅斯福——都沒有表現出有任何獨裁的傾向，雖然，那些曇花一現的黨人，曾經作相反的說法。</p>
<p>美國也不願意放棄由於兩大黨皆能代表不同社會每一份子而造成的廣泛利益。第三黨絕非如此，它們常是代表一種思想的——廢止賣奴·禁酒·人民主義——因此它們祇是一個團體。在這樣一個如此巨大，資源氣候如此長繁複，經濟社會利益如此分歧，人民及其信仰如此複雜的國家裏，促進團結乃是這些黨的重要條件。在這個對於變動中的問題具有而且增強其情緒的人民中，基於團結及折衷的原則而建立的黨的組織，顯然是很有價值的。</p>
<p>美國政治機構的性質，從漢彌敦和傑弗遜時代止，變動之少是很驚人的。我們可以說美國全國的安定，大部份是由於這一事實所造成。（美國新聞處譯）</p>

<h3>新的房屋設計</h3>
<p>美國新聞處譯稿</p>
<p>在美國從事未來房屋與建築設計的目光遠大的建築師，已經預料到房屋的構築上將有驚人的變化。就其發展的可能說，建築方面的進步，將從試騐性的設計，逐漸成為實際的製造。</p>
<p>將來的日光，將不經由牆壁上所開的窗洞進入房屋，而是由整個的建築予以吸引，濾過，和人造的光線作適當配合後，再造成一個綜合的環境來適應某種特殊的要求的。很多的這種必須的物質和設備已經現成準備好了。首先，這裏有一種玄妙的控制工具——光電池（Photoelectric　Cell）。這種光電池可以感應最微小的光的變動，它現在已被應用於開閉教室中的電燈，開關教室的門，並可計算進入教室中的人數。這差不多是任何一種自動控制光線問題的合理辦法。</p>
<p>用機械移動的活動牆壁　現在已是美國工業上的一個常見的東西，現在並有許多的房屋裝上一種活動的屋頂，它可以用撳鈕控制而使其滑到一邊去。巨大的用金屬和普拉斯蒂克作成的百葉窗，將由機械控制而自動地調節日光。</p>
<p>未來的建築物中，都將應用能夠透過紫外線的玻璃，因為普通玻璃是會將紫外線隔斷的。這類玻璃並將遮蔽紅內線，紅內線是普通玻璃大部漏進的。廁所中應用的，將不是百葉窗與毛玻璃及窗帷的混合，它們將為一種「單向」的玻璃所代替，此種玻璃，看得外面而外面不能看到裏面。或者它們將另一種偏光玻璃（Polarized　Bless）所代替，這種偏光玻璃，祗消用手指輕輕一彈，就可以遮斷視線。</p>
<p>溫度調節</p>
<p>現在看起來，似乎沒有理由認為支持混凝土地板及天花板的鋼架，不能擔負發熱圈的雙重任務。牆上可以裝上建築於內部的電阻圈，以使它們能於接上電流以後，就可成為散熱的來源。</p>
<p>輻射冷卻機構的最大困難，乃是夏季溫度高度時的凝結問題。在這樣的情形之下，輻射面上的水氣猶同一隻裝有冰水的玻璃杯。因此，它就限制了這種輻射的冷卻於夏季濕度較低的地區，或者則在空氣可以用人工方法予以乾燥的建築物內。但那些可以吸收空中水份的化學物質如矽及綠化鉀的發展，指出以某種單純而有效的化學物質來使空氣乾燥的方法不久就可獲得成功。如此可使夏季室內的舒適大為增加，卽使不用冷卻的工具亦然。</p>
<p>輻射的機構，解決了各種複雜的建築問題，這些問題在今天以前一直是認為不能解決的。舉例說：在醫院中手術室，病人在行手術時須要較為溫暖，而同時則緊張的醫生則希望溫度較低。由於病人行手術時溫度太低可以引起死亡，而醫生在高溫中僅僅是不舒服而已，所以常常是醫生遷就病人同在較高的溫度中行手術。但有了輻射的來源以後，就可以一方面用熱的空氣使病人溫暖，而以牆壁上冷輻射的片子「集中焦點」於醫生而使其涼爽了。</p>
<p>太陽熱</p>
<p>加州和佛羅里達州的日光熱水器每年都從太陽吸取充足的熱力而獲得了可觀的結果，雖然這種熱水器是很原始的。現在明白需要的是一種可以將「能」化為易於儲藏的一種形式。這種，大自然又提供了一種技術——光化作用。假定我們完成了模倣最普通的野草利用和儲藏「能」的方法，則房屋的設計就將痛快地大加修改。這工作是屬於物理學家及化學家的。這個問題一旦解決以後，則有可能在任何氣溫之下利用照射在房屋表面上的陽光使房屋提高溫度，降低溫度。我們因此也就可以利用房屋的「表面」，在需要溫度時將向熱力的「能」直接傳入內部，在不需要勢力時將隔絕在外面，同時使其成為炭，酒精或電力，加以存儲，準備他日應用。</p>
<p>廚房</p>
<p>關於明日的廚房，現在已經開始有種種的預言。一個有趣的趨勢是將碟子等等的器具裝在相當於腰部的廚櫃中。過去祗有一隻爐子，將來則會有一套特殊的廚房用具。由於迅速冷卻方法的得到更多應用，因此這同一方法可以用於冰箱中而在冰箱中備有各種不同的冷卻，冰凍及快凍的器具。</p>
<p>我們已有許多希望。但有許多最困難的問題尚需等待實際的解決。舉例說，碗碟的洗滌和垃圾的處置便是如此。從衛生的觀點來說，祗用一次就將其拋棄的紙碟子或者普拉斯蒂克碟子是沿著正確方向進行的一個意見。更其可以令人滿意的，該是一種簡單而價廉的洗碟機，其中附有紅內線可以完成快乾及消毒殺菌的工作。同樣，除了農家的廚房以外，一般廚房都須要有一種簡單的方法來處置垃圾。用一種電動磨子將垃圾磨成粉末然後傾入陰溝中，也許是今天最有效的一種方法。</p>
<p>其他廚房中的應用器具，尚待實騐室中的試驗：例如內部裝燈而透明的爐子和炊煮用的鍋　，高頻率的感應炊煮法，旋轉的器物架等等。</p>
<p>浴室</p>
<p>美國如果因為有一件事而著名，那就是我們每人都有浴室可以享用的生活程度，浴室儘管已經成了美國社會中為清除身體上渣澤而完成的第一個成功的工具，但它距離合乎理想的情形還遠。浴缸的基本缺點乃是當洗滌身體的時候，其中的水同時越來越汚濁。淋浴的基本優點則是洗浴者並非在一個靜水中而是在川流不息的水中清除身體。如果將這兩種配合一下，到是很合要求的——在一個洗浴缸中慢慢地流通著一個不斷更換的水流。這種浴室已經普遍地被醫療機關所應用了，如果，將其應用於其他地方，將促使它加以改良而且有更為準確的活塞來控制水的溫度與容量。更進一步的研究無疑將會造成一種比較不太滑腳的，更易清潔的和感覺起來更舒適的浴缸。</p>
<p>通常用的便缸，是沒有正確的形狀高度和角度的將來，便缸將比較低，且其角度是很急地向下向後灣的，連接著便缸的坐位，在每次使用以後都會自動地消毒。現在已有幾種專利了的式樣和設計，其座位是彈出到後面的消毒箱裏的，消毒箱可以用水流或紫外線消滅各種寄生蟲。</p>
<p>抽水馬桶在使用後，將不再用水浪來沖洗，而改由一層薄薄的水來洗清全部馬桶的內壁，這種馬桶將有通氣的裝置。它將不再以現在的這種瓷質作成，而改用金屬和普拉斯蒂克織成的內壁。將來的這種抽水馬桶會採用膝部和腳踏的控水開關。和浴缸一樣，以後的馬桶裏也將不是靜水而是流動的水流了。此外，在技術上講，也沒有理由不可使它減輕重量到十磅或者十五磅。</p>
<p>空中房屋</p>
<p>一九四六年，建築師蕙德凱設計了一個用氣球吊起的屋頂，以供聖路易的露天歌劇塲應用。這種露天劇塲是祗在夏天夜間應用的，劇塲上空並不需要有一個屋頂而使其成為一個永久性的建築，但夏季的驟雨是很討厭的。因此他就設計了一個透明的，由氦氣所充滿了的氣球，這氣球飄浮在露天劇塲的上空，如果遇到突然起來的大雨，就會沿著尼隆作成繩索拋下一個玻璃絲織成的天幕。這一切是由飛艇外的籃子中所裝的馬達所控制的，那籃子並且還裝置了控制舞臺燈光的用具。這樣，當並不需要時，整個的機構就可以停到地面上的其他地方。</p>

<h3>淸江大姑山　發現史前遺蹟　土城石器百餘件　俱屬黑陶文化系</h3>
<p>〔長沙訊〕淸江大姑山史前遺址發現以來，確引起國內學者之注意，據發現人饒惠民兩年來之調查，此次遺址已有三處，中以大姑山土城，拾到石器百餘件，計分斧·　·刀·鏟，　·手磨盤·磨捧等種，陶片三千餘斤，有黑·白·灰陶及鋼礦紡物各物。</p>
<p>最近饒惠民因事經過另一邱陵田地，又發見較小土城三座，相距僅半華里，面積之大，約五七畝不等，在三座土城中亦拾到陶石百數十件，石器有斧·刀·　·磨盤·陶片花文有繼文·蓆文·格文·波文·回字格文等十餘種，並有扁平　錐式之鼎足數枚與前大姑土城中所發見者，為同一時期之遺物。</p>
<p>現淸江有此史前遺址，已發現者，共計七處，每處均有土城圍繞，此七遺址均位於贛江溢城邊附緣近，相距約四十華里以內，因此足證大小不一之土城，係遠古部落時代之堡居遺址，並非城市或後代之軍事防禦工程，可想見當時江南人口尙為稠密，贛江流域之遠古文化，亦甚客觀。</p>
<p>且最早發現大姑山土城遺址，經饒惠民研究，其遺物中有三分之一以上，屬於黑陶文化系，色澤分黑亮·深黑·棕黑·灰黑·褐黃等種，陶質為黏土及混砂兩類，所混砂多少不一，並含石英子粒及雲母粹片，文飾有藍文·條文·格文·　文·絃文·仍以素地者佔多，另有一種扭旋文飾，係用拇指尖壓成，頗為簡樸美觀，從其色·質·文及製作風格比較，均與龍山良渚等地出土之黑陶，極為相同。</p>
<p>故淸江史前遺址有黑陶之發見，於龍山系黑陶文化傳播問題之推測，及江南史前文化之研究，皆有重大關聯，現發現人饒惠民氏，正着手撰寫淸江史前遺址調查報告，以供國內外考古專家研究。</p>
<h3>漢口空軍機械官　鍾烈兆殺妻經過　堂弟烈廉被提起訴</h3>
<p>〔漢口訊〕漢口上年十一月間發生一空軍機械官鍾烈兆夥同堂弟鍾烈廉，以雙釘謀殺髮妻朱秀蘭一案，詳情前誌本報，茲悉：兇犯鍾烈廉一名，已在江西興國縣就逮，並已移解漢口地方法院偵辦。按該犯鍾烈兆因另有情人，遂對髮妻秀蘭日益厭惡，而鍾烈廉平日與其嫂氏感情亦不睦。在去年十一月八日晚，該鍾烈兆因故與妻發生爭吵，當卽夥同堂弟鍾烈廉，於深夜將門窗緊閉，以紗帶猛勒朱秀蘭之頸項，又用鐵釘將其兩太陽穴猛刺而死。頃經漢口地方法院檢察官將就逮之鍾烈廉一名詳細偵查，認為犯罪證據確鑿，已依法提起公訴，惟該犯胞兄鍾烈彥正在漢口各方大肆活動，冀圖為其開脫，並聞已暗中賄請××法院職員藍某（江西樟樹人）代為缓頰，但該犯共同行兇，旣經漢口地方法院檢察處提起公訴，自難逃罪，將來是否判處極刑，頗為各方重視，茲錄漢口地方法院檢察官起訴書全文於后：</p>
<p>被吿：鍾烈廉，男，二十三歲，江西千縣人，學生，住江西興國中山路鍾鴻昌號。</p>
<p>右開被吿民國卅七年度急字第二九一號殺人案件，業經偵查終結，認為應行起訴，茲將犯罪事實及證據，並所犯法案敘述如左：鍾烈廉係空軍第六供應分處補給檢驗股機械官鍾烈兆之堂弟，因投考學校，到漢口寄居於烈兆宿舍中，烈兆另有情人，遂對其髮妻朱秀蘭日益厭惡，爭吵多次，因懷仇恨，烈廉亦對其嫂不睦，去年十一月八日晚，該夫妻又發生吵鬧，後卽由烈兆商同烈廉於深夜將門窗緊閉，以紗帶勒朱秀蘭之頸項，又用鐵釘將其兩太陽穴刺殺而死，烈兆兄弟卽將門鎖好，分別潛逃，嗣因同　之人以情形可疑，於次日下午五時，開門，發現朱秀蘭死屍陳於床榻，卽報由警察局轉請勘驗偵查，種烈兆部份已函請空軍第四軍區司令部究辦，鍾烈廉部份已由朱秀蘭之兄朱統蓮等呈請江西興國縣政府緝獲，轉送到院。</p>
<p>查朱秀蘭屍體仰臥於本市勝利街三八二號空軍補給組宿舍三樓寢室床上，左右眉間，各一傷，靑紫色硬腫，圍圓不齊，沿痕量週圍四寸二分，有血痕，均係木器傷痕，內各破裂一小洞，左深半分，右深抵骨，鮮血污流，係加鐵釘刺傷，咽喉左右，有紗帶一根，圍繞頸項周匝，結締在前痕溝呈紫褐色，有血痕，血暈，係被人勒死，兩手腕連手背，一片紫赤色血痕，各有手指條痕，左手背紫暗色二點，右手背紫稜色三點，均各如指頭大，係生前被人手捉傷，經本院敖檢察官督員驗明，確係生前勒頸項，加傷兩太陽穴斃命，填有驗斷書在卷，當檢驗時，訊據空軍見習官傳景熏供稱：我在星期一八號吃晚飯後，他們夫妻與姓鍾的堂弟還在房間裏，當時三人在房間裏沒有發生爭吵，後來鍾烈兆的弟弟出去了，我在當晚八點鐘時，就上街去了，至九點鐘以後，我才回家，聽得他們房間裏發生打架的聲音來，我敲了他們的門，裏面聲音就停止了，到我們回房以後，他們又打起架來，我卽下樓去，呌劉機械官劉楚德隨卽又上樓敲登他們的房間，時間有一刻多鐘，裏面一直沒有聲音發出，後來我們就走開了。第二天早晨，看見他們房門鎖了，直到下午五時，我才同劉建德打門進去，房裏發現鍾太太死在床上等語，劉建德亦供同前情一樣等語，迨問該處伙伕賈榮堂你認識他們的弟弟嗎，則答我亦認識鍾烈廉，我在樓下住，他們在樓上住，只聽得樓上有響的聲音，沒有看見他們拿東西走等語，是鍾烈廉是日確在漢口無疑，而該被吿竟諉稱是月七日搭車赴株州，顯見情虛，該被吿旣在漢口，又同其兄嫂同居於一室，則其嫂被害而死，謂非共同實施，其誰能信？又據被告稱：該寢室原有烈兆之母在內住，但據鍾烈錞稱：其母親早已回家，足證被吿言語支吾，委有刑法第二十八條第二百七十一條第一項之罪嫌，合依刑事訴訟法第二百三十條第一項提起公訴，卽請審判。</p>
<h3>國產機動車在廣州</h3>
<p>〔廣州訊〕我國之有機動車出品，戰後尚屬首見於穗市，興業機械廠製造之機動車，市面已多有行駛，每見風馳電掣於通衢大道，為交通生色不少，記者會至該廠營業部及工塲訪問，茲以所得印象報導，以　讀者：</p>
<p>敎育路十九號是該廠營業部，在靜鬧適中之地方；陳列着各种颜色之車輛，吸引着大批觀眾，他們皆以一種好奇心理，端詳審視，該處之技士等，均忙於向觀眾解釋關於車之構造，性能及駕駛方法，與一般顧客所欲知悉之一切問題，營業部主任何君，以和藹之笑容向記者招呼，講解此經二年期間之試驗，改良所成就之產品：如省儉用油，適合我國經濟情況，駕駛簡便，旨在普及應用，并對於全部製造過程作詳盡之述說。又囑技士以實際動作當衆試驗，何君并邀請記者試行駕駛，記者以聆悉各項步驟，竟能毫無困難而開行，深覺其操縱之如是簡易，起動後，坐於車上，兩腳踏地，卽將右手所把持之膠筒旋轉，車身卽徐向前行，待速率增加之能平衡才將兩腳提至踏板上，於是車之進行快慢皆只從右手膠筒之向左右扭轉而操持之。經十餘分鐘之馳騁審察，覺其有較普通單車尤為簡便駕駛之處，蓋車身輕巧，高度適中，重心低而重點寬，故絕無難於支持之感，駕駛可稱謂絕對安全，此項成就，殊為我國工業界放一異彩！</p>
<p>為實地明白該廠製造情形，記者乃再赴該廠本部參觀，承廠長導進工塲，見數十青年技士藝徒皆聚精會神於各種工作，各部門皆有專門人員監督指導，工作情緒頗為緊張，各種機器設備皆甚完善，其中有數部工作機，據云在本市尚屬僅有。所缺憾者，卽廠地面積似嫌太小，致裝配車輛存放稍有侷促之感，見各種未施工已施工及正在施工之配件，足可證明係屬純粹之國貨。</p>
<p>友人黃君會購車一部，記者以其對此使用經月，關於行駛利弊當可洞悉，乃卽以見詢，彼稱自購此車後，「行」之苦已盡解決，以前成乘長途汽車與三輪車所耗之金錢時間，現在已可減省五至十倍，月餘來亦未見有何毛病發生，僅有一次為其友駕去，却竟擱置路旁，而致耽誤若干時間，蓋其但知駕駛容易，竟忽略問明應具有之知識，致死火後不知如何起動，故余意該廠必須印就簡明之說明書附於車上，使每一駕駛者，皆能臨時明白其應做方法，必可減少許多麻煩云。</p>
<p>以本人觀感所得，該廠能有此出品，於交通上殊屬一大貢獻，尤其能對駕駛之安全，而減少肇事機會之發生，為其特點之一；以我國工業落後之國家，大部份對於機械認識不大深切，致有視機器為困難而麻煩之心理，該車却以最簡單方式而造出，為其特點之二；速率與衝力均甚適中，海珠橋觀音山皆能上下自如，而用油省儉，亦為其特點之三；在應用方面，其價格與舶來品相差幾及三倍，以吾國經濟能力衡計，自甚適合，其次對於該廠人員之服務精神，應予稱許者，卽其無論何時對於顧客觀眾皆能盡其責任，舉凡敎導駕駛，保養使用，及偶過有何難解決情形，若以電話吿知，該廠能於數分鐘內派員驅車前至協助。總之，在科學落後經濟動盪之我國，能克服種種困難，而有此成就，自屬難能可貴，惟仍希望該廠能加強宣傳力量，多印該項車輛之說明刊物，以引起一般對於機械之興趣，則前途正不可限量。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律釋疑　房屋糾紛問題</h3>
<p>唐鳴時律師主答</p>
<p>吳鳴　問：友人某甲，於民國三十三年央中租得乙方房屋一間，言明期限一年，並由甲方交付乙方儲鈔一萬五千元作為頂費。期滿後甲方如不遷讓，則乙方得要求以通用法幣廿萬元將該屋全幢頂於甲方，不得推諉。後因時局關係，甲方於期滿後並未遷出·最近乙某病故，其婿丙某央調人丁某會同原向甲方要求償付乙之治喪費用，否則將履行前約，限期遷讓。茲有疑問數點，請予解答。</p>
<p>（一）在敵偽期內，成立此項租屋合同契，現在是否有效。（二）本合同期滿後，雙方並未改訂契據，而繼續居住者已事隔四年，現在出租人仍要照原合同辦事，要求承租人退讓此屋，請問此合同，租權是否存在。（三）假使此合同已喪失租權，而出租人籍處理喪事為名欲將該屋全幢出頂他人，或將承租人所住之一部份轉頂他人，那時強迫承租人遷出，請問現行法律許可否。（四）當時承租人進屋時，已交付通用幣鈔計一萬五千元正，請問此費是否算頂費。（五）倘出租人以處理喪事為名，要求承租人貼補任何費用，請問可否拒絕。（六）如出租人以黃金三兩私將承租人所住之一部份房屋轉頂他人，請問在法律上是否犯罪。（七）本合同當時並未貼有印花稅，此契請問是否有效。（八）但承租人實在困難無力遷出，為防未來安全，是否要向當地警局預先存案。</p>
<p>〔答案〕（一）私人契約，雙方同意，卽屬有效。故卽在敵偽時期成立之租約，亦應認為有效。（二）定期租約，期滿後如承租人繼續付租，而出租人繼續收租，則雙方已成立不定期租賃關係，承租人已取得租賃權矣。（三）非法勒遷，法律當然不許。（四）在租金以外，如有給付，或為頂費，或為押租，要看雙方證據認定之。（五）出租人家之治喪費，從無向承租人要求貼補之理，若屬救濟性質，自當別論。（六）上海市政府會三令五申不准收受頂費，如有私相頂讓，可向地政局吿發。（七）契約之有效與否，不因印花稅而受影響，缺貼印花，不過依印花稅法處罰并補貼，並不因之而致契約失效。（八）可以向該管警察局陳明情節，以便日後發生事端時有所依據。</p>
<h3>錦城即景</h3>
<p>物價的漲勢越來越快。兩點或三點鐘滾上一滾。六十多萬的成都市民，有二十多萬沒有職業，他們多半是退休的官吏和閒逸的地主及其親眷，他們消費量增大，收入則相當銳減，十有九家的生活遼不如昔，而且經常呌苦，有些人甚至準備朝鄉下疏散。</p>

<h3>The Communist Army on the Outskirts of Shanghai Cannot Escape Annihilation. National Army Positions Stand Firm. Huangdu and Nanxiang Abandoned; Communications to Nanhui Severed; Communist Troops Spotted Harassing the North of Hongqiao Airport, Engagement Underway</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] The military released a battle report at 9:00 PM on May 15th:</p>
<p>(1) The Great Shanghai Defense Battle has now entered its fourth day. Thanks to the close coordination of our army, navy, and air force, which has unleashed its power, the invading bandits on all fronts have suffered heavy setbacks. The bandits who have been lured into several pocket-shaped positions are now doomed to annihilation. Since the evening of the 14th, the annihilation battle in the Liuhang area has also been fiercely launched. Three divisions of a certain bandit force, under the suppression of our strong artillery fire, have suffered more than 10,000 casualties. However, the bandits are constantly reinforcing and counterattacking. Our army's morale is high, and they are repeatedly charging and killing. The bandits are leaving piles of corpses. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. Furthermore, the invading bandits on the Yuepu-Yanghang line, after being surrounded, annihilated, and repelled by us, the battle situation had turned quiet by noon on the 15th.</p>
<p>(2) After the main forces of the 85th and 87th Divisions of the invading 29th Army suffered casualties and retreated in defeat, the bandits launched another fierce attack on our Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang fronts with the main force of the 28th Army starting at 2:00 PM on the 14th. Our defending troops calmly responded and, after luring the bandits deep, gradually launched an encirclement and annihilation with the concentrated firepower of the army, navy, and air force. From the morning to noon of the 15th, more than 3,000 bandit corpses were left in front of the Liuhang and Yanghang positions. We captured countless spoils of war, and our positions remained firm.</p>
<p>(3) Over a thousand local communists harassed Nanhui from Fengxian, Hehe, and other places yesterday (the 14th). Communications to the outside world from that area are currently severed.</p>
<p>(4) According to reports, the bandit reinforcement units from the Songjiang and Suzhou areas are successively advancing towards our front lines. Our defending troops on all sides are closely watching and are determined to give the bandits a major blow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report:</p>
<p>(1) Around 6:00 PM yesterday, bandit troops of unknown strength and designation were spotted harassing our forward positions in the north of Hongqiao Airport, Nanyuan, Qibao, and Wengbanqiao. They are currently engaging with our defending troops.</p>
<p>(2) In the past two days, the bandits have continuously reinforced their troops and implemented a consistent "human wave" tactical charge on our positions north of Liuhang. Some attackers were identified as belonging to the 28th Army. However, they ultimately could not cross the "Lei Chi" (red line) by even a step. This is due to the proper coordination of our army, navy, and air force, the close collaboration between infantry and artillery, and especially the loyal spirit of our officers and soldiers who bravely fought for their lives. This is truly a head-on blow to the bandit army's attack on Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] Military sources, 11:00 AM on the 15th: After the start of the Great Shanghai Defense Battle, according to our pre-planned strategy, we took the initiative to abandon Huangdu and Nanxiang on the 14th and concentrated our forces on the main positions, preparing to annihilate the invading bandits.</p>
<h3>"Sea of Fire" Eliminates the "Human Sea." The Army, Navy, and Air Force Coordinate to Unleash Their Power. Communist Corpses Litter the Fields of Yuepu and Yanghang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report:</p>
<p>(1) Starting at dusk on the evening of the 14th, the 28th and 29th Armies, with a force of five divisions and one brigade, fiercely attacked our Yuepu and Yanghang positions using wave-like tactics, launching more than five consecutive assaults. All were annihilated by our loyal and brave officers and soldiers with intense firepower in front of the positions. Bandit corpses littered the fields. After this severe blow, the bandits suffered heavy casualties. After midnight, the battle subsided. Our morale is extremely high, and we are all determined to annihilate the bandits.</p>
<p>(2) Two divisions of the bandit 28th Army launched a fierce attack on our Liujiahang position using "human sea" tactics at dusk on the 14th. Officers and soldiers of a certain unit of our army calmly responded. By late at night, the bandits were lured into a pocket-shaped position and completely annihilated.</p>
<p>(3) At 10:00 AM on the 14th, our army launched a counterattack from Yuepu against the bandit 87th Division, annihilating 2,750 bandits, capturing 264 alive, and seizing more than 150 light and heavy machine guns and rifles, along with many other spoils of war.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] Military sources, 11:00 AM on the 15th:</p>
<p>(1) For days, over 20,000 of the bandit main forces have fiercely attacked our national army positions on the line north and south of Yuepu Town. Our defending troops bravely fought back in coordination with the armored units. At the same time, our navy vessels, such as ××××××, fired from the ×× area, fiercely bombarding the bandit army positions. The booming sound never ceased. A large number of warhawks also sortieed day and night, closely cooperating with the ground forces, maximizing the effect. The invading bandit army, under the combined attack of our army, navy, and air force, suffered a painful annihilation, with an estimated 5,000 bandits killed and over 800 captured. Countless light and heavy weapons, ammunition, and supplies were seized. The bandit offensive was frustrated, and they retreated in disarray. As of now, the battle situation has calmed down.</p>
<p>(2) Three divisions of a certain unit of the bandit main force split into groups on the 14th and fled south from Luodian, using fierce artillery fire as cover, fiercely attacking our Yanghang and Liuhang national army positions. Our defending troops bravely fought back, and a certain artillery unit also unleashed high power, firing to assist in the battle. The bandits' several fierce attacks were repelled, suffering heavy casualties that were difficult to count.</p>
<h3>A Tour of Wusong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] Although fierce battles have been raging just a few miles away for the past two nights, the town of Wusong has not suffered any war damage so far. According to a certain marine regiment commander, Wusong has not been affected by the war because the communist artillery is not yet capable of placing the town within its range. This morning, apart from sporadic artillery fire and machine-gun fire heard from somewhere for only a few seconds, Wusong is as peaceful as if there were no war, even though fierce battles were taking place in its western strongholds less than twelve hours ago, and the occurrence of battles after twelve hours is also foreseeable. It is said that at one point, the communist army was dangerously close to Song Town, but they have now been driven away, and the town can at least be temporarily safe. Morale is high on the front lines, and an optimistic atmosphere is overflowing everywhere. Some army and navy officers and soldiers talk to reporters about the war as middle school students discuss ball games, with excitement and joy. Recently, although some important strongholds have been abandoned, the spirit of the soldiers on the front lines has not been slightly diminished, and they are all deeply convinced that they can drive out the communist army. The naval side is especially confident. According to the Marine Regiment Commander, since the army has received reinforcements from the navy ships, the arrogant communist army has also transformed into caution and slightly curbed its arrogance. The Regiment Commander also told reporters that the communist army's casualties are ten times greater than the National Army's. This is due to their "human sea" tactics and because they are almost always on the offensive. Along the way, the reporter saw well-equipped national army troops heading to the front lines. In addition, there were also three or five soldiers returning from short-term leave back to the front lines. The reporter's car passed three such soldiers, who were hitchhiking. They belonged to a certain engineering unit and claimed that the unit had defeated three regiments of the communist army in a certain area. In contrast to the troops heading to the front lines, there were hordes of refugees pouring into Shanghai. The large number of people caused traffic to be blocked. The refugees all wore a calm expression, as if they were resigned to their fate. Among the crowd, there were also occasional smiling faces. The resilience of the Chinese people can be seen here.</p>
<h3>Songhu Defense Headquarters To Uniformly Release Battle Reports</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] Battle reports from the Songhu area were originally uniformly released by the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command. Now, because the Shanghai Defense Battle has begun, the Songhu Defense Headquarters is in charge of combat affairs, and the Political Warfare Department of the Headquarters has been newly established. In order to ensure the rapid transmission of war news and detailed reporting, starting today (the 16th), the Political Warfare Department of the Headquarters will be responsible for uniformly releasing the battle reports, twice a day at 10:00 AM and 9:00 PM, to be relayed by the Central News Agency.</p>
<h3>Wusong Fortress Is As Solid As A Rock. Naval Artillery Fire Covering Army Response Has Great Effect</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] A spokesman for Naval Headquarters told reporters yesterday that since the 12th, the naval vessels stationed in Shanghai have been cooperating with the army and air force in participating in the Great Shanghai Defense War, and the results of the battle have been extraordinarily fruitful in recent days, especially in the past two days (the 13th) and yesterday (the 14th). Several of our ships have carried out ruthless and fierce artillery bombardment on the invading bandit troops in the Shizilin, Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang areas, covering the army's response, and the effect has been great. According to reports, more than 5,000 bandit troops have been killed, and many bandit artillery positions have also been destroyed. Currently, in order to avoid naval artillery fire, the bandit army positions are gradually moving to the right wing, but because the range of the naval guns is very long, it is still difficult to escape our fierce fire net. The Wusong Fortress area is now as solid as a rock. There is absolutely no problem with this gateway of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the naval vessels participating in the Great Shanghai Defense War are in extremely high spirits. Among them, several vessels have repeatedly achieved great battle achievements in the Yangtze River Defense War. For example, the Yongjia ship once coordinated with the army on the Anqing River surface to painfully annihilate tens of thousands of head bandits. When breaking through to Shanghai, the ship bombarded the bandit army along the way, suppressing the bandit army's artillery fire and finally being able to safely pass through. Many other ships are similar, so the officers and soldiers are extremely excited about the task of defending the Great Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Air Force Continues to Inflict Heavy Damage on Communist Troops. Zhou Zhirou Personally Flies to the Front Lines to Command Operations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] According to Air Headquarters, today (the 15th) is the third day of the Shanghai Defense Battle. The Communist troops are not only deploying heavy troops to seize the key areas of Yuepu, Yanghang, Liuhang, etc., outside the Wusong Estuary, but are also densely moving their troops from Jiading and Songjiang, etc., southwest of Greater Shanghai, towards Shanghai, and are also advancing towards Chuansha from Fengxian and Nanhui east of the Huangpu River. Our army, navy, and air force are fighting bravely and bloody, and the fierce battle is being carried out intensely in the perimeter of Greater Shanghai, especially in the Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang areas. The Air Force continues to work tirelessly, launching attacks in the skies over the perimeter of Greater Shanghai 24 hours a day. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Between Luodian and Yanghang and Liuhang, the communist troops have increased their trenches, with about 10,000 communist troops hiding in them, waiting for an opportunity to pounce on our positions. The Air Force has been suppressing and monitoring them in the air all day long, bombing and strafing them whenever they move. It is estimated that more than 2,000 communist troops were killed in the triangular area of Luodian, Yanghang, and Liuhang today (the 15th). At 11:00 AM, they also assisted our tank force in destroying three communist positions near Liuhang.</p>
<p>(2) There are many communist artillery positions in Xin Town. Our planes suppressed them all day long, destroying seven artillery positions, almost completely silencing their artillery positions. The communist fortifications between Xin Town and Liuhang were also bombed, causing more than 2,000 communist troops to be killed or injured here.</p>
<p>(3) More than 2,000 communist troops were spotted one kilometer east of Nanhui, and more than 1,000 communist troops were spotted in Zhapu. It is estimated that over 400 of them were killed or injured.</p>

<h3>The True Face of Peace in Beiping (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>(4) The Fierce Battle of Tianjin</p>
<p>After Beiping was besieged, the Communist Party launched a "probing attack" on Tianjin. Although the national army's forces gathered in Tianjin were only two armies, their combat effectiveness was very strong. However, because the disparity in numbers was too great, the defense circle became smaller and smaller. The most intense days of fighting were January 12, 13, and 14. According to friends who went from Tianjin to Beiping afterwards, from the afternoon of the 12th, the sound of artillery was even denser than the sound of machine guns. The deafening sound was like thunder in summer, continuously ringing into one piece. The four words "ceaseless rumbling" are not enough to describe it. This fierce battle lasted until dawn on the 15th. Tianjin had no city walls. The national army was just holding on to the trenches and fighting bitterly. Afterwards, military friends in Beiping criticized the national army who defended Tianjin as being truly strong, and the communist army who attacked were also truly brave. In total, the Communist Party itself admitted to more than 50,000 casualties in this battle, and the actual number must have been even higher. In the end, the communist army broke in through Xiyingmen. At that time, the trenches there were already filled with communist corpses who had been killed while charging forward. The attackers were able to step over the corpses and pass through. Thus, Tianjin fell, but please relax, Tianjin's compatriots, although the offensive and defensive battles in Tianjin were so fierce, the destruction in the city was not too tragic. First of all, for ordinary citizens, according to newspaper reports, the front line statistics showed that the number of deaths and injuries was at most four or five hundred. Secondly, for buildings, those destroyed by artillery fire were only Dongjuzi, Xiyingmen, Zhao Jia Street in the southwest corner of the city, the Zhengzhong Bookstore in the former Japanese Concession, the Zhihua Church area, the Wuzhou Pharmacy area in the old French Concession, Sanma Road in Hedong, and the area near the North Station. The rest were largely intact. After the communist army entered the city, the first measure was to change Zhongzheng Road to Liberation Road, and invite the key figures into the "VIP Camp". It is said that Du Jianshi had disguised himself on the night of the 13th and hid in the US Consulate in Lihua Building, because his personal attendant was a member of the Communist Party. After the communist army entered the city, he informed on him, so he was arrested on the 19th. Garrison Commander Chen Changjie, until the communist army broke in, was still wearing a cape and his left arm was covered with medals. He sat firmly in his office chair at the Garrison Headquarters, directing military affairs by telephone. The communist army, angered by the large number of people who died under his command, hated him to the bone, so he was locked up in the Garrison Headquarters with Lin Weijun and other top war criminals. Liang Ziqing, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, who was also Chairman of the Municipal Party Committee, was hailed as a special agent chief. The newspaper announced that he would await the People's Public Military, but his location was unknown. Yang Yizhou, Speaker of the Municipal Council, who worked hardest for the local peace in Tianjin, was also taken into the "VIP Hotel". As for the captured national army officers and soldiers, they were handled in the following ways: (1) All officers were sent to the Northeast for training. After they were deemed to have changed their thinking, they would be given a national citizenship order for comparison. (2) Old, weak, and disabled soldiers were given a certain amount of travel expenses depending on the distance, and a certificate was issued, allowing them to pass through the communist-controlled areas and take the train back to their hometown. (3) Young and strong soldiers were incorporated into the Liberation Army to replenish casualties during combat and were absolutely not allowed to return to their hometowns. After Tianjin fell, all 19 large and small newspapers in the city were closed down. The Military Control Commission took over the Tianjin Minguo Daily, and Mao Zedong awkwardly inscribed the title, publishing a Tianjin Daily, whose content and style were the same as other communist party newspapers. It only focused on proclamations and propaganda, not on news, but because it had good innate conditions, it was printed very carefully, with many pictures and photos. It was published daily on a large sheet of paper, and on Saturdays, it was published on two large sheets of paper, which was much more impressive than the Xinhua Daily published in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War. All the others were dead and buried. Only the Tianjin Yishi Daily, until the Communist Party shouted "Freedom of Religion" to the skies and had a relationship with the Roman Catholic Church, was repeatedly asked to be re-published, but it was never considered. The Tianjin Dagong Daily was generally believed to have an impartial attitude in its comments, and was somewhat left-leaning, especially since Fan Changjiang, who was so popular in the communist news circles, came from the newspaper. Now, Xu Ying and Peng Tiangang, who are stationed in Beiping, are also relatives of the Communist Party and have also used various methods to campaign for re-publication, but the result is still zero. Later, the Tianjin Military Control Commission renamed it the Progress Daily, but it is not known for sure. The Xinhua News Agency broadcasted and severely criticized the Dagong Daily for its history of being a running dog of warlords and the Political Science Department. Other measures were roughly the same as in Beiping, which will be described later. As for Tanggu, it is well known that two days after Tianjin fell, the defending soldiers boarded warships and retreated with the entire army, which I will not repeat here. The current chairman of the Tianjin Pseudo Military Control Commission is Huang Kecheng, the Pseudo Mayor is Huang Jing, and the Pseudo Deputy Mayor is Zhang Youyu.</p>
<p>(5) Beiping's Brewing</p>
<p>The brewing of peace in Beiping can be divided into two aspects: the social aspect and the military aspect. I will quote them below:</p>
<p>As for the brewing of peace in the social sphere, if we proceed in chronological order, Zhang Yinwu should be considered the first to advocate it. At the beginning of the siege, when no one dared to publicly advocate peace, he made a stunning statement in the Liaison Association of National Representatives of the 29 Provinces and Cities in North China, publishing his high opinion that peace must be sought immediately. At that time, the dispute was very intense, and some of the representatives who attended the meeting slammed the table and withdrew. This scene was published in newspapers in various places in mid-December of the 37th year, so I will not repeat it. Since then, he has continued to work hard, attending every meeting and advocating peace whenever possible. I think anyone who writes a local history of peace in Beiping will have to write the name of Mr. Zhang on the first page. The second is Xu Huidong, Speaker of the Beiping Municipal Council. Around the siege, he also contacted the responsible persons of the council in the six units of Hebei, Jin, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Tianjin to form a Joint Association of Councils of Seven Provinces and Cities. Not long after the siege, he responded to the methods of Zhang Yinwu and others, frequently convening peace movement meetings of all sectors in the Municipal Council. His diligence in running around is known to everyone. Details can be found in the Beiping newspapers during the siege. There is no need to elaborate. The person who finally knocked on the door to peace was He Siyuan. Mr. He was originally the mayor of Beiping. After handing over his post, he became an honorary citizen of Beiping. At the beginning of the siege, he seemed to be still in Shanghai. The date of his return to Beiping was probably one or two days before my return to Beiping. After getting off the plane, he told reporters that he came specifically to work for peace. Therefore, he spent his days going in and out of Zhongnanhai and shuttling between the Municipal Council. Finally, he led ten representatives out of the city, covered in dust and exhausted. Later, his residence at No. 9 Xila Hu Alley was hit by several shells. His daughter, He Baozai, died, his wife was injured, and he himself was injured in the arm. Regarding the brewing of peace, from the beginning of the twelfth lunar month to mid-January, after the efforts of Zhang, Xu, and He, it finally matured. When humanity reaches its most dangerous moment, its instinct is to seek survival first. As for the way of life after survival, that is the question. Therefore, at this time, there was no one who sang the opposite tune. The ten peace representatives seemed to leave the city on the 17th (the date is not too clear). The composition of the representatives was He Siyuan as the leader. The rest seemed to include Legislator Lu Fu, Chenghui representative Guo Shutang, Chamber of Commerce representative Liu Hongrui, Women's representative Kang Tongbi, etc. On the evening of the 16th, they first contacted the Communist Party by radio, agreeing to go to Haidian from Xizhimen at 9:00 AM the next morning to meet with Ye Jianying. Very early on the 17th, the ten representatives gathered at the Municipal Council. Because Mr. Fu hesitated and delayed until 3:00 PM before departing, the ten of them sat in a large car with a large white flag in front of the car with the words "North China People's Peace Delegation" written on it, carrying these ten representatives who were holding their breath, cautiously out of Liangzhimen. When they were about to reach Wanshengyuan, they were stopped by gunshots, and two soldiers without cap badges came up to question them and accused them of being late. Then, they got into the car and guided them to the west. When they passed Wanshengyuan North and turned to Baishiqiao, there were random gunshots in front of them. The guide stood outside the car and shouted, "Comrades, don't shoot. They have surrendered." After that, they went north smoothly and were no longer hindered. After arriving at Haidian, the ten representatives were hosted in the Xie residence in Donghoutou. The house was very spacious. Ye Jianying did not meet them. It is said that Ye waited all morning but did not see them, and went to Tianjin on urgent business. A Mr. Huang met them on his behalf. Mr. Huang was very proud of being a victor. During the conversation, when the representatives mentioned the Central Government, he pretended not to understand and insisted on calling it the Pseudo Central Government. When talking about the term President, he pretended not to know and insisted on calling him Chiang Kai-shek. (To Be Continued)</p>
<h3>The National Army Receives Orders for Strategic Retreat, Wuhan Becomes a Vacuum, The Central China Command Headquarters Moves to Hengyang and Changsha to Establish a Command Post, Bai Chongxi Flies to Chang Yesterday by Plane</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 15th] The Wuhan National Army received orders on the 15th for a strategic retreat. Garrison Commander Lu Shiyuan issued a written statement at 7:00 PM, saying: "My headquarters was ordered to garrison Wuhan. For the past two months, we have received assistance from the local elders, and the results have been satisfactory. We are immensely grateful. All attacks by the bandit army have been repelled. Now, my headquarters has received orders for a strategic retreat, abandoning Wuhan. As we are about to depart, we are filled with reluctance. In the future, local security will be the responsibility of the police and the people's self-defense corps. We hope everyone will maintain their livelihoods and not be alarmed." Currently, the 58th Army and the Garrison Headquarters responsible for garrisoning Wuhan have completed their withdrawal. The entire city has become a vacuum. Protection groups, fire brigades, and the police are maintaining security. The city is still calm, and all newspapers are still publishing as usual.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 15th] It is reported that the entire Central China Command Headquarters has moved to Hengyang and established a command post in Changsha. Commander Bai Chongxi will be stationed there permanently to preside over matters. The new building of the Hunan Provincial Assembly has been selected as the office address. Bai arrived in Chang today and immediately announced its formal establishment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 15th] Bai Chongxi, the Chief of Military and Political Affairs of Central China, arrived in Changsha at 1:20 PM today on the Zhuiyun special plane from Han.

<h3>Yan Xishan and Others Initiate Anti-Communist and National Salvation Movement, Scheduled to Establish an Anti-Aggression Organization</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] After the Communist army crossed the Yangtze River, their arrogance has become increasingly rampant. People from all walks of life in Guangzhou believe that anti-communism and national salvation are the most urgent tasks at present. This work is not simply the responsibility of the government or a particular party, but is something that all citizens should strive for. Therefore, at 4:00 PM on the 15th, Yan Xishan, Zou Lu, Li Wenfan, Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, Ma Chaojun, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, Jiang Yuntian, Wan Hongtu, Xia Sheng, and others initiated a tea party at the German Scholars Association on Wende Road to discuss how to carry out anti-communist work. More than fifty people attended the meeting, and Yan Xishan was elected as the chairman. He reported on the significance of the meeting, stating that since the peace talks broke down, the Communist Party has actively attacked Central China, which proves their ambition to communize China and East Asia. Under these circumstances, the Chinese people must strengthen their unity and unite with the people of East Asian countries to form an anti-aggression front to give the Communist Party a powerful blow and shatter their aggressive attempts. All parties, factions, and non-partisan individuals in the country should first have an anti-aggression organization and then an anti-aggression movement. With an organized and powerful approach, they should unite with anti-aggression countries around the world to stop the Communist Party's aggressive actions. If this view is considered necessary, an anti-aggression organization can be initiated to jointly seek progress. Then, Chen Qitian, Wan Wutu, Qian Cheng, Yu Jiayao, Zhang Qiyun, Chen Kezhong, Zhang Daofan, Yu Lingyun, Chi Zheng, Xiao Zheng, Huang Zhong, and others spoke, generally agreeing that an anti-communist organization and movement are urgently needed at present and should be established as soon as possible. Close contact should be established with international anti-aggression and pro-freedom individuals to achieve national independence, political democracy, economic equality, and freedom of life, and to jointly ensure world peace. Finally, the following points were decided: 1. All those who participated in today's meeting are initiators. 2. For the organization and program, Yan Xishan, Chen Qitian, Ma Chaojun, Wan Hongtu, Zhang Qiyun, Qian Zhong, Cheng Tianfang, Gu Zhengding, Yuan Qian, Gao Xin, Yang Gongda, Jiang Yuntian, Wang Shihui, and other thirteen people are designated to draft the organization's name, program, and charter, which will be convened by Yan Xishan. 3. The second meeting of the initiators will be held at 4:00 PM on the 19th to decide on the name and program. The founding assembly will be held on the 22nd. After the program is determined, a declaration will be issued to actively promote anti-communist and national salvation work.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 15th] Yan Xishan replied to foreign reporters today, saying that President Chiang has not been invited to Guangzhou to lead the government or the Kuomintang. The Central Committee of the Kuomintang has not made any decision on this matter. I have also not been invited to take any position in the government, and I have never considered this matter.</p>
<h3>Meticulous Deployment in Northern Fujian, Communication Restored Between Nanping and Fuzhou</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Fuzhou, 15th] Zhu Shaoliang and Huang Zhenwu went to Gutian yesterday to make arrangements and returned to Rong on the same day. They immediately presided over an important meeting of the Pacification Headquarters and made decisions regarding the stability of the situation in northern Fujian. A spokesman for the Rong Martial Law Headquarters declared: The National Army has made arrangements, and the security of Rong City is not a concern. He hopes that citizens will remain calm and not believe rumors, lest they disrupt their own plans. According to a person who came from Gutian on the 14th, there is a large army stationed there, and the county government is busy day and night supplying the military, but the discipline of the stationed troops is quite good, and everything is very normal. The person came to Rong via the valley mouth, changing to the Jianxi waterway. The situation at the valley mouth is also stable. As for the situation north of Jian'ou, it is not as serious as the rumors here suggest. Furthermore, the telegraph service in Nanping was restored in the afternoon of the 15th, and the National Army has regained control of the area. The authorities believe that the lack of communication about the situation in northern Fujian has caused unrest in the rear. The Pacification Headquarters has dispatched several wireless communication teams to send accurate information from various locations to avoid the spread of rumors and prevent them from shaking people's hearts.</p>
<h3>Refugee Students Sign Up for the Army</h3>
<p>Sun Liren Expresses Welcome</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] High school and college students in the war zone, having witnessed the cruelty of the Communist bandits and unable to bear their trampling, have sought refuge together in order to fight for a "free way of life." After arriving in Guangzhou, although the Ministry of Education introduced them to schools for enrollment, they could not concentrate on their studies due to the turbulent situation. They have petitioned the Ministry of Education to join the army. Minister Hang telegraphed Sun Liren, the Commander-in-Chief of Army Training, who replied in a telegram: "We welcome young people who can endure hardship, are hard-working, and have patriotic enthusiasm to join the army." The students were very excited about this news, and more than 300 have already signed up. High school and college students who have sought refuge in Guangzhou individually and have not yet enrolled in school are also enthusiastically participating and are currently signing up and registering. They will be sent to the Guangzhou Youth Guidance Center for collective registration procedures. It is learned that the Guidance Center has decided to cooperate with the Army Training Command's Recruit Regiment in Guangzhou starting on the 16th to recruit personnel. Registration will be conducted at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. It is reported that almost all of the more than 500 refugee students currently residing at the Second Temporary Reception Station of the Henan Wufeng Prefecture Education Department's Youth Guidance Association have signed up for the army. The Youth Guidance Association has agreed to lend the reception station to the Army Training Department's Recruit Regiment as a temporary shelter. The students residing at the station will soon be issued clothing and food by the Recruit Regiment, and they are scheduled to take a special ship to Taiwan in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Formulates Measures to Settle Refugee Students</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] On the settlement of refugee students, Ministry of Education spokesman Zhan Jiewu told reporters: The Ministry is actively handling the settlement of refugee students and has established temporary reception stations to accommodate students from various places in Guangzhou. The Ministry's Guidance Association has sent staff to manage the stations, take attendance, and issue temporary relief funds for verification. As for the settlement of the students after they arrive in Guangzhou, measures have also been formulated. Regarding high school students: (1) Those who volunteer to join the army have been discussed with the Army Headquarters Training Department, and the Guidance Association will cooperate with the Department's Guangzhou Recruitment Office to handle the students' registration. After registration, they will be sent to Taiwan for training. (2) Student training camps will be held. This matter is currently being discussed with the Ministry of National Defense.

Zhan continued: Currently, the population of Guangzhou is crowded, and prices are high. The Ministry of Education has notified the reception stations to move to the southwest provinces in the rear and should no longer concentrate in Guangzhou to avoid difficulties with food and lodging.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong People Somewhat Reassured, Stock Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Most Exporters to North China Lose Money</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 15th] After the British authorities expressed their determination to defend Hong Kong, the people of Hong Kong were somewhat reassured, and property and stock prices rebounded. Property in prosperous commercial areas rose by 60% compared to the past two weeks, while residential areas rose by 10%. The stock market, which had been sluggish for a week due to public apathy, suddenly became prosperous over the weekend. All stocks rebounded from their lows. Public utility stocks saw the most transactions. The stock transaction statistics for the past week were 1,211,999 shares, with a market value of more than 2.6 million yuan. Due to the large-scale return of Hong Kong dollars and the stagnation of exports, general commerce in Hong Kong has been sluggish. Although trade with North China has resumed, exporters have mostly reported losses due to various restrictions. Although the Hong Kong market is sluggish, commodity prices remain high. Grain prices have risen sharply due to difficult sources and population growth. The wholesale price of rice on the free market is 84 yuan per dan. Meat prices have also risen by about 30% compared to the previous month. Gold prices remain high, but diamond prices have increased by 30% since the end of last year.</p>
<h3>U.S. Halts Japanese Reparations Program, Ambassador Gu Will Issue Statement, Personnel of Delegation to Japan Will Be Reduced</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 14th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun said on the 14th that the Chinese representative to the Far Eastern Commission will discuss the recently announced U.S. policy on Japanese reparations at the Commission's next meeting.

<h3>Editorial: The Rise of Street Stalls and Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>In the past few days, the streets have been lined with street stalls, one after another. Several normally quiet streets are also noisy with people; busy areas are even more crowded. The desolate cityscape is adorned with a distorted prosperity. The goods sold at the street stalls are mostly daily necessities; and the owners of the street stalls are mostly junior employees of industry and commerce. At first glance, it is indeed very lively, but there are many onlookers and few buyers; despite the cheap prices and good quality, there are always very few who inquire, which fully shows that the decline of industry and commerce in Shanghai is on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Since the breakdown of peace talks and the resumption of war, the economic situation in Shanghai has also deteriorated with the dramatic changes in the military situation. Due to the war, maritime transport on the northern and Yangtze River lines has also been suspended, resulting in general American products having no way to be exported, and stocks piling up like mountains, and funds cannot be circulated, and so it has fallen into a state of stagnation. At the same time, due to the decline in purchasing power of the general public, shops are deserted, and some do not even have a single transaction in a day. Under these circumstances, it is of course difficult for industry and commerce to maintain, but to close down, they do not have the ability to dismiss employees. So, they distribute unsold goods to employees as severance pay. In order to maintain their daily lives, the employees are eager to turn the goods they receive into cash, and this primitive-era market-style street stall emerges.</p>
<p>The operation of street stalls will affect legitimate shops, and for industry and commerce, it is "adding fuel to the fire." At the same time, the operation of shops must be registered with the competent authorities and must pay taxes. Setting up a street stall does not require these procedures, which will affect tax revenue. However, this type of stall is different from past stalls. Due to the difficulties faced by industry and commerce, they cannot maintain, and have no choice but to distribute the manufactured goods to employees, who then turn them into cash to maintain their livelihoods. This is the last batch of rewards earned with labor and sweat, temporarily used to get through the current days. After they are sold out and eaten up, how will they live? It is impossible to imagine. This kind of situation, this kind of struggle, is truly pitiful, and of course it cannot be summarily banned.</p>
<p>However, stalls are set up every five steps on important traffic routes, and gatherings every ten steps, everywhere is crowded with people. This makes pedestrians feel extremely difficult, with a feeling of "cannot move," so the municipal authorities have to come forward to intervene, limiting the areas where street vendors can operate, stipulating the following eleven places: (1) Beijing Road; (2) Nanjing Road; (3) Fuzhou Road; (4) East Zhongzheng Road; (5) Jinling Road; (6) East Linsen Road; (7) The Bund from Waibaidu Bridge to the 16th Pier; (8) Sichuan Road; (9) Jiangxi Road; (10) Fujian Road; (11) Zhejiang Road, where street stalls are not allowed to operate. This is a helpless measure, and street vendors should of course comply.</p>
<p>However, designating areas for street vendors to operate is only a temporary expedient measure. But how long can this distorted liveliness last? After the vendors have sold out and eaten up their goods, how will their lives be arranged? Is Shanghai's industry and commerce really allowed to go to a dead end? Are these millions of employees who rely on it to maintain their livelihoods allowed to fall into unemployment? Rescuing the current crisis in industry and commerce is a matter of utmost urgency. The main thing is to channel the output of industrial products so that funds can be circulated, manufacturers can maintain, and employees can be spared unemployment. This certainly requires the government's earnest support, as well as the assistance of relevant agencies, to overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<p>In fact, this kind of difficult encounter is not only for Shanghai's industry and commerce, but for the general public, it is even more unbearable. Just look at the goods on the street stalls, which are so cheap that they can't be any cheaper, but there are still very few buyers. In short, the rise of street stalls is the most serious social problem at present. For industry and commerce, it can be described as "drinking poison to quench thirst," which is harmful and useless to legitimate industry and commerce; for society, it is an even more serious problem, showing that Shanghai society has reached an extremely serious stage!</p>
<h3>From Haiyan to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Oasis</p>
<p>After Hangzhou was lost, the author accompanied his elderly mother and a dozen other refugees who had fled at the same time on a boat to Haiyan, arriving after four days.</p>
<p>With a feeling of wandering, I went ashore and learned that there were no National Army troops stationed in the four suburbs of Meiyan. At the time of the fierce fighting in Anji and Xiaofeng, it was already in a vacuum state, with no National Army and no Communist Army. The market was maintained by a small number of locally organized "Baojia Joint Teams," and there were very few robbery cases. The streets were unusually desolate, and gold yuan notes had disappeared. Citizens used silver dollars and copper coins as the currency of exchange. Only three or four newspapers had suspended publication, leaving only one four-page Haiyan local newspaper.</p>
<p>After dawn on May 5, the weather turned overcast, and it began to drizzle around 9:00 AM. I inquired and learned that there were wheelbarrows that could go to Yangjiao Town, about fifty li from Pinghu. I accompanied my elderly mother with five yuan in silver dollars, plus a gold ear pick weighing eight or nine fen, to hire a cart to the town, traveling along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Along the way, the wheels rumbled, and the misty rain over the fields was a unique experience.</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, the cart arrived at Liucun. The carter and I went into the village to find a shop to have lunch. When we entered the village, we suddenly encountered four local communists of unknown number, who stopped the cart to check us. One of them stepped forward to snatch my handbag and opened it to see a geography book printed with the national flag, which he immediately tore up and asked in the Jiangsu dialect where I came from. After I repeatedly explained and showed my Hangzhou ID card and documents, he allowed us to enter the village. After entering the village, I saw two small mountain cannons parked on the small street in the village, and I realized that the Communist army had occupied the village. The situation in the village was very bleak, with only a few villagers helping the Communist army to move things.</p>
<p>After lunch, we went back on the road. About two li from the village, we encountered another small squad of Communist army sentries, about twelve or thirteen people. After seeing me, they only asked a few questions and let us go.</p>
<p>We arrived at Yangjiao Town in the evening. There was no Communist army in the town. That night, the rain stopped and the moon came out. We stayed overnight in a very small inn. The next day, the weather turned sunny and the temperature was very hot. So I hired another two-wheeled ox cart to set off for Pinghu. The ox moved very slowly, and the highway was destroyed all the way, so we had to take a small detour. However, the situation was still stable. We arrived in Pinghu at about 3:00 PM. Pinghu was not occupied by the Communist army, but the market was very chaotic. No one was interested in the silver dollars in our hands. Rice prices plummeted, and most of the shops were closed. Only a few self-defense teams and security police maintained order on the streets. I heard that there would be an early bus to Songjiang the next morning, so I accompanied my mother to spend the night at the station.</p>
<p>At 6:00 AM on the 7th, seven buses in a row arrived in Songjiang, but the crowded situation was rare. After repeatedly discussing with the driver and promising to pay four extra silver dollars as a reward, he allowed my elderly mother to sit next to the driver. The bus only set off at 9:00 AM. It was stopped and searched by military police along the way to Fengxian, Zhelu, Tinglin, and Jinshan. It was delayed until late before arriving in Songjiang. As soon as we got off the bus, we heard that Pinghu was lost, and the passengers in the same car all expressed their good fortune.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 8th, we took the train to Shanghai. The train stopped at Longhua and did not proceed. After inquiring, we found out that it was another military police inspection. This inspection was very strict. Those without Shanghai resident ID cards were not allowed to get off the train. I was also not exempt. Later, after I showed my documents and called a friend in a Shanghai newspaper, Mr. Qian, to vouch for me, I was allowed to get off the train. Then, I took a car to Shanghai.

<h3>Diplomatic Personnel From a Certain Country Talk About Sino-Soviet Relations, Saying That There Is Definite Evidence That the Soviet Union Is Aiding the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] The Central Daily News here today published a New York dispatch from the 6th, saying that it is rumored in New York that the British delegation to the United Nations has obtained sufficient evidence of Soviet assistance to the Chinese Communist Party. This would allow China to accuse the Soviet Union at the United Nations and make the world understand that China's anti-communist war is not a civil war within one country, but an international war. After this news was disclosed, the Chinese delegation was instructed by the government to inquire with the British delegation about the truth. Reporters from various news agencies also actively moved around, probing the contents. However, for some diplomatic reasons, the British delegation has not been willing to announce it publicly, and even in response to inquiries from the Chinese representative country, they only replied with vague and general terms, because the time for announcement is not yet ripe, so they have to adopt this attitude. I have quite a bit of contact with diplomatic personnel from a certain country here. The other day, after a cocktail party, this diplomatic personnel and Gao Cailie talked a lot about the Sino-Soviet relationship. I learned from his mouth that the evidence obtained by the British delegation includes secret documents or photos regarding the following matters: (1) In September 1945, at the request of the Chinese Communist Party, the Soviet Union refused to allow Chinese troops to land in Dalian and Lushun to take over the Northeast. (2) According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, the Soviet Union should have withdrawn all Soviet troops occupying the Northeast before December 3, 1945, but in order to facilitate the transfer of the Northeast to the Chinese Communist Party, the Soviet Union delayed its withdrawal until May 1946. (3) The Soviet Union obtained weapons from the 700,000-strong Japanese Kwantung Army in the Northeast. In addition to shipping heavy artillery and large tanks to the Soviet Union, the remaining weapons, such as rifles, machine guns, mortars, and small tanks, were all handed over to the Chinese Communist Party. As a result, the Chinese Communist Party's unarmed soldiers entered the Northeast from North China and immediately acquired equipment, becoming a strong fighting force. (4) In 1946, when the Soviet Union sent Li Lisan back to China, it sent several senior military officers to Harbin to serve as military advisors to Lin Biao. Since then, all operational plans against the National Army have been formulated by Soviet advisors. (5) After 1946, the Chinese Communist troops in Shandong continued to obtain replenishment of weapons and ammunition from Dalian and Lushun to fight against the National Army. (6) After the Chinese Communist Party seized heavy artillery from the National Army, no one could use it, so the Soviet Union sent artillery officers to China to command. (7) After the Chinese Communist Party occupied the Northeast, it signed a secret agreement with the Soviet Union to supply the Soviet Union with steel and soybeans produced in the Northeast for a period of ten years. (8) Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia, unable to bear the oppression of the Soviet Union, rose up in resistance, seeking to win independence for the country. Moscow immediately ordered all communist parties around the world to condemn Tito, and the Chinese Communist Party also followed orders meticulously. (9) This year, in March, under the supervision of the Soviet Union, representatives of the Chinese Communist Party and the Korean Communist Party signed a mutual assistance secret agreement in Moscow. The Chinese Communist Party immediately obtained military assistance from the Korean Communist Party through this secret agreement. (10) Recently, twelve countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy signed the North Atlantic Security Treaty to resist the Soviet Union's aggressive policy. The Soviet Union was very afraid and ordered all communist parties around the world to issue statements attacking the North Atlantic Treaty and claiming that they would unanimously defend the Soviet Union and resist the United Kingdom and the United States. After receiving the order, Mao Zedong issued a broadcast speech on April 4, claiming that the Chinese Communist Party would lead the Chinese people to fight for the Soviet Union. The above ten points are all well-founded facts that can prove that the Chinese Communist Party is secretly colluding with the Soviet Union to carry out its true intention of seizing Chinese power.</p>

<h3>Restoring Trade Relations Between East and West Germany: The Four Powers Have Reached an Agreement; The First Cargo Ship from Hamburg Sails to Berlin</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 14th] Wilkinson, the Economic Advisor to the US Military Government, announced today that the four powers, the US, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, have almost completely reached an agreement on the restoration of trade between East and West Germany. The entire agreement is expected to be finalized by next Wednesday. From then on, commerce between the four occupation zones in Germany can begin to advance rapidly. Although the blockade has been lifted, the volume of trade is still limited. The three-day meeting of the four powers' economic advisors ended today. According to Wilkinson's statement, excellent progress has been made at the meeting. The Soviet Union intends to restore the old agreement on trade between East and West Germany, which was suspended during the Berlin blockade in June last year. Western countries believe that it is no longer applicable because it violates the current supply and demand situation and is based on a single Mark currency system for all of Germany. Since the joint use of East and West Marks, there has been no satisfactory exchange plan. Wilkinson also stated that the entire agreement could be signed next Wednesday. This is the first four-power meeting held in Berlin since last spring.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 15th] The "New York Times" today carried a report from Frankfurt stating that the Soviet Union has assured the US Military Government that it will immediately resume the shipment of wheat, timber, and similar goods from the Soviet zone of Germany to the 18 countries of the Allied Reparations Agency, to fulfill the Paris Reparations Treaty and the Potsdam Agreement. The Soviet side made this proposal at a meeting with officials of the US Military Government and was immediately accepted. The Soviet proposal was sudden, and did not mention that the United States should also resume shipping reparations goods from West Germany. The Soviet representative clearly wanted to conduct negotiations in an atmosphere of complete agreement.</p>
<p>[Reuters Herlenburg, British Zone, 14th] After the lifting of the blockade, the first river cargo ship "Anna" from Hamburg arrived here tonight and is en route to Berlin. According to the captain, he did not feel troubled by the Soviet inspection and hoped that the Soviet officials could quickly inspect the cargo on board. He expects the ship to arrive in Berlin on Monday afternoon. The Soviet inspection station is located in Wittenberg, twelve miles from here.</p>
<h3>Reviewing Joint Strategies on the German Question: Satisfactory Consultations Among the Three Countries; Austria Requests the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to Discuss the Austrian Treaty</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris, 15th] Representatives of the US, Britain, and France held a secret meeting at the French Foreign Ministry for two and a half hours yesterday to discuss a unified strategy for the three countries at the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. After the meeting, the representatives remained tight-lipped about the contents of the meeting. The meeting will continue on the 16th. Those present today included the British Deputy Foreign Secretary, Mr. Coulbert, US Envoy Jessup, and French Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Barraudy, as well as experts on German issues from the three countries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 14th] French diplomatic sources expressed satisfaction with the progress of the three-country talks. They hinted that the talks were only exploratory in nature and that discussions on various issues would begin next week. The US proposal to withdraw occupation troops has been rejected again, but diplomatic sources said that this does not mean that the Western countries will put forward active and concrete proposals at the beginning of the talks.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 14th] British authorities today denied a report in the "Evening Star" that Deputy Foreign Secretary Coulbert had carried a detailed plan to solve the German question when he went to Paris to attend the preparatory meeting on Germany. The evening paper also said that this plan was drafted by Foreign Secretary Bevin. Well-informed sources said that Coulbert did not receive any firm instructions for the three-country preparatory meeting. Foreign Secretary Bevin will also not have a firm plan when he goes to Paris in the future. Some quarters said that when Bevin was in Germany last week, he published the opinions of German political leaders, who reportedly asked the Western occupation forces not to withdraw from Germany before the new government established by the Bonn Constitutional Assembly can cope with any political demonstrations supported by force.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 15th] A spokesperson for the Austrian Embassy in Paris expressed satisfaction with the results of Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber's meeting with representatives from the US, Britain, and France yesterday, saying that "the Western countries were very understanding of the opinions put forward by the Austrian representatives." Gruber requested in yesterday's meeting that the Western representatives include the Austrian treaty issue on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. He will leave here for Vienna tonight, but will return here when the Foreign Ministers' Conference is convened.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 14th] The new US Ambassador to France, Bruce, arrived here today from Washington. The ambassador told reporters that he did not know whether he would be a member of the US delegation to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>

<h3>Cargo Transportation in Austria: The Soviet Union Relaxes Controls</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 14th] The Soviet authorities have decided to relax cargo transportation controls at the borders of the Soviet occupation zone in Austria from May 25th. Coal, oil, timber, certain metals, and fodder will be deregulated in the future, but grain, scrap iron, and manufactured goods still require permits. The Soviet High Commissioner in Austria has formally notified Austrian Chancellor Figl of this decision today.</p>
<h3>McCloy Has Agreed to Serve as US High Commissioner to Germany</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse New York, 14th] According to the Daily News, International Bank Chairman McCloy has accepted the position of US High Commissioner to Germany and will also serve as the head of the ECA branch in Germany. Truman will announce McCloy's appointment in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Italian Government Orders Ban on Political Collective Marches</h3>
<p>Fighting Breaks Out During Rome University Elections</p>
<p>[United Press Rome, 14th] The Italian government banned collective political marches in Rome on the 14th, placing new restrictions on the Italian Social Movement, which openly has fascist characteristics. This order aims to suppress neo-fascist propaganda and to deal with the peace conference scheduled to be held here on June 14th by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Rome, 14th] Today, during the election of representatives of the law department at the University of Rome, there was a heated debate, followed by hundreds of students fighting each other, resulting in seventeen injuries, three of whom were seriously injured. Some students even set up obstacles in the hall to defend themselves during the election.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Postpones Closing: Special Voting on the Spanish and Italian-Administered Territory Issues; Compromise Recommendation Adopted for the South African Discrimination Against Indians Case</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly will not be able to adjourn tonight and will have to heatedly discuss the two issues of Spain and former Italian territories next Monday. Latin American countries have proposed restoring full diplomatic relations with Spain. After this issue is resolved, the Italian colonial issue will be discussed again.</p>
<p>The Indian accusation against South Africa for discrimination against Indians was passed tonight by the representatives with a vote of forty-seven to one (South Africa) and ten abstentions, requesting South Africa, India, and Pakistan to hold a round table conference. This is a compromise action. In the previous two General Assemblies, the representatives had accused South Africa of violating basic human rights in its treatment of Indians. After voting on this case, the President of the General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, declared that the General Assembly still had important cases to discuss, and unless there was opposition, the meeting would be extended to Monday morning. The tired representatives applauded in approval. The closing date of the General Assembly depends on whether it can quickly resolve the two issues of Spain and the Italian colonies. There are many people requesting to speak, and it is feared that a vote will not be possible until Tuesday. Latin American countries have proposed fully restoring relations with Spain, and it is doubtful whether this case will pass. Both the supporters and opponents claim that they can win. The distribution and trusteeship of Italian colonies has been voted on by the Political Committee.</p>
<h3>US Loan to Spain to Be Announced Soon</h3>

<h3>French President's Speech</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Lyon, 15th] French President Auriole said in a speech here today that international peace, like the unity of a country, must be based on respect for individual and public freedom, respect for the principles of justice between people and nations, and respect for the foundations of each people, its traditions, and its political system. In short, it must unite independent countries to ensure the security, independence, and prosperity of every individual.</p>
<h3>Soviet Exports of Manganese and Chromium Ores to the US Decrease</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 14th] Soviet exports of the important raw materials manganese and chromium to the US are decreasing, and some people believe that the Soviet Union wants to force the United States to relax restrictions on exports to the Soviet Union. The United States is stockpiling manganese and chromium for wartime use. According to statistics released by the Bureau of Statistics, the value of manganese and chromium imported in March was only 600,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 50% compared with February, and only one-third of the same period in 1948.</p>
<h3>Australian Prime Minister Calls for a Pacific Pact</h3>
<p>The American Legion Proposes the Same</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Ducan, 15th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley proposed the establishment of a Pacific Pact to the whole of Australia today in order to support the need for the Atlantic Pact to ensure regional security. Chifley said: "To establish a joint defense pact in the Pacific region, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand should first reach an agreement, then the United States should join, plus other countries with territories in the Pacific. As for the plan for this pact, it can be drafted according to the Atlantic Pact."</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 14th] The American Legion urged the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today to immediately consider the Pacific Treaty, just like the North Atlantic Treaty. According to President Newcomb White at the meeting, the contributions of the Pacific countries to the opposing regional defense system are almost not as great as those of the European countries, but we should recognize that the advancement of a certain aggressive country on the opposite side of the Pacific will ultimately force the United States to fight for freedom again. The United States must adhere to a firm policy to prevent the recurrence of war.</p>
<h3>US 25 Senators Unanimously Approve: Organizing an International Volunteer Army to Prevent Any Armed Attack on Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 14th] Two new Republican senators recently proposed the establishment of an international volunteer army to help maintain peace in Europe. The two senators are Murtaugh and Hendrickson. Murtaugh and Hendrickson said: This army can alleviate any armed attack on Europe and comply with the Atlantic Pact. Murtaugh visited the State Department to inquire about negotiating the conclusion of an Asian and Near Eastern defense treaty as a supplement to the Atlantic Treaty. The suggestion to establish an international volunteer army was put forward by Cobson in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. According to Cobb: This volunteer army is composed of volunteers from smaller countries and stationed in troubled areas, such as West Germany. The army is controlled by the defense agency organized by the majority of representatives of the Atlantic Treaty countries. Cobb also said that 25 senators have approved his plan so far, and the plan also advocates abolishing the veto power of the United Nations. According to Hendrickson, Cobb's suggestion can make the United Nations and the Atlantic Pact effective tools for maintaining peace. Murtaugh said that he was very interested in Cobb's plan. Murtaugh also proposed other ways to strengthen the Atlantic Pact and the United Nations as follows:</p>
<p>Establish an Asian Pact, including China</p>
<p>(1) Establish an Asian and Near East Pact and connect it with the Atlantic Treaty or other treaties, or expand the foundation of the Atlantic Treaty to include "non-communist countries" such as Spain, the Chinese Nationalist Government, or Israel. (2) Led by the United States, convene a full United Nations conference, including the Soviet Union, to find an agreement to abolish the veto power and control atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. Murtaugh said: This agreement may also be established without the participation of the Soviet Union. Murtaugh's suggestion to expand regional treaties is the same as the views expressed by Wellington Koo, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries' politicians.</p>
<p>Nehru believes the time is not ripe</p>
<p>On the contrary, Indian Prime Minister Nehru believes that the time is not yet ripe to conclude a Pacific Pact with the Atlantic Pact. Nehru believes that the governments and economic conditions of many Eastern countries are unstable, which will eliminate the possibility of signing a united and effective alliance. US officials have not ruled out the possibility of concluding a Pacific Pact in the future with the assistance of the United States, but it is said that they are very skeptical whether the situation will be favorable in the near future. Many US officials agree with Nehru's views. They are unwilling to consider or suggest US participation in any such pact unless there is a sounder basis for the pact. US officials believe that the situation in Asia is very different from that in Europe. In Europe, the signatories to the Atlantic Pact seem to have reached the same stage of government and economic development, and have complementary economies. On the contrary, many Far Eastern countries do not trade with each other, but trade with Western countries. In addition, some Asian countries are still non-autonomous regions under foreign rule. Many US officials believe that this will further complicate the conclusion of regional alliances.</p>
<h3>The US Is Willing to Have Asian Countries Form a Pacific Pact</h3>
<p>The US Will Consider Such Assistance</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 15th] US officials believe that Asian countries must be stimulated without external encouragement and decide for themselves whether they need a Pacific Pact similar to the Atlantic Pact, and whether they can achieve the sound foundation on which the pact is based. If Asian countries can reach an agreement on the necessity of the Pacific Pact, and if they can achieve the initial economic cooperation that the US government considers necessary, then the US government will sympathetically consider any request for "differential assistance". Generally speaking, this is what US officials have told the representatives of various Eastern countries who have requested the United States to join this pact. The most recent person to request the establishment of an Eastern Alliance was Chinese Ambassador Wellington Koo, who suggested this to Secretary of State Acheson on the 11th. Among those who have made the same suggestion are representatives from the Philippines and Australia.</p>
<h3>US Military Aid Plan: The State Department Issues a Booklet Explaining Four Points</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 14th] The State Department today issued a booklet entitled "Building Peace, the US Military Aid Program". It stated that US military aid to Western Europe will continue until all threats of a third world war are completely removed. The booklet also pointed out that the 1950 military aid program depends on the decision of the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) Except for Greece, most of the proposed aid is for re-equipment, which can be maintained for many years in peacetime. (2) The increase in the military strength of European recipient countries should be limited by economic recovery. (3) Western Europe's self-sufficiency and increase. (4) The degree to which the threat of war may be removed. The 1950 military aid program is estimated to require 1.13 billion yuan for most countries and 320 million yuan for Greece, Turkey, and other security zones. The president has the power to use the funds expediently to cope with emergencies at any time. There are three types of assistance methods: (1) Small amount of monetary assistance to increase Western Europe's military productivity. (2) Direct supply of weapons and equipment. (3) The United States provides technical and training assistance.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Completes Mission: Resumes Position as President of Columbia University</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 14th] Eisenhower was called to Washington in February to serve as the temporary chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to solve some difficult military problems.

<h3>US Communist Eisler Escapes to Britain and Is Arrested</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 14th] Eisler, a German of German descent who was identified by the US House Un-American Activities Committee as "America's Number One" Communist, secretly boarded the Polish mail ship Batory to Britain from the United States. He was arrested by the police on the ship tonight and is now being held in Southampton Prison. He will be interrogated on Monday and then sent to the London court to review the US Department of Justice's request to extradite him. Eisler was sentenced to one year in prison and other penalties in the United States and was released on bail of 23,500 yuan. Unexpectedly, he secretly boarded a ship and fled to Britain, so the State Department requested the British authorities to arrest him when the ship arrived in Britain. The Polish authorities originally intended to protect Eisler from being arrested. After negotiations with the British authorities, they were told that unless Eisler was handed over, the ship would have to wait until 5 pm on Monday to solve the matter. If it could leave Southampton, it would continue to sail to Poland. The Polish authorities had to yield. The Polish Embassy protested to Britain against Eisler's arrest on the grounds that Eisler was on a Polish ship. However, when the British police boarded the ship to carry out the arrest, the captain of the ship and Polish diplomats did not interfere. Only Eisler himself struggled to resist and was eventually taken ashore by four policemen on a small boat. Officials from the Polish Embassy stated that the embassy did not intend to make any statements before contacting Warsaw. Eisler's arrest warrant was issued based on the 1870 Extradition Act and was executed by Scotland Yard Detective Blythe. Also present were US Embassy Counselor Van Reed, US Consul to Southampton Baker, and representatives from the Polish Embassy and Consulate. The group first went to a cabin near the captain's office and brought Eisler, who was sitting alone in the bar, to the cabin. The outside of the room was guarded by police officers, and negotiations were immediately held inside. Panki from the Polish Embassy and Polish Vice Consul Zimlewski negotiated with Blythe for three hours. Then, the two Polish representatives and Blythe went ashore and asked the Polish Embassy and the Ministry of the Interior for instructions. At 6 pm, Blythe obtained the arrest warrant and re-boarded the ship to carry out the arrest.</p>

<h3>Great Success in Stabilizing the Japanese Economy: Dodge Arrives in San Francisco and Makes a Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press San Francisco, 14th] MacArthur's financial advisor Dodge arrived here today aboard the President Wilson, saying that the mission to stabilize the Japanese economy has been successful. Dodge will report to the State Department and believes that it is not necessary to return to Japan. It is said that the work of the delegation based on MacArthur's headquarters' economic stabilization directive of December 10, 1948, has produced the following important results: (1) A balanced budget, which stopped the massive losses of the Japanese government's long-term progressive progression and removed its vicious double taxation. (2) Abolish export subsidies and reduce import subsidies. (3) Establish a fund, mark the amount of US aid in the budget, allocate it to government funds, and not use it for administrative expenses. (4) Establish a single exchange rate to encourage foreign trade and rationalize it. (5) Strengthen the allocation of raw materials to achieve the maximum limit of exports and production. All this and other related plans aim to create a situation in which Japan's relatively low total national debt can be adjusted and developed in line with its traditional industry and the productive capacity of its people, moving towards economic self-sufficiency.</p>

<h3>Another Super Heavy Cruiser Completed: Officially Enlisted in the US Fleet with Fifty-Three Cannons, Unmatched in Power</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Boston, 14th] The third American super heavy cruiser, the 17,000-ton "Salem," was commissioned into the fleet today. This ship is of the same class as the "Monrovia" and "Newport News." US Chief of Naval Operations, Denfield, stated that this ship is a clear indication that the United States will never allow aggressors to endanger the American way of life. Any enemy who sees the ship's armament will think twice before acting. The ship's firing rate is more than four times that of American wartime cruisers, and its fifty-three cannons can target and fire at any enemy aircraft or ships. The "Salem" is equipped with nine 8-inch automatic cannons, arranged in three turrets, as well as the latest automatic cannons and anti-aircraft guns. The ship's speed exceeds 30 knots per hour.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Passes Freedom of Information Convention, Soviet Representative's Fierce Opposition Proves Ineffective</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly today passed the "Freedom of Information Convention." US Representative Grant called it "the first attempt in history to codify the constitution of collecting and transmitting news into international law." The convention stipulates an international right of correction, whereby if a country believes that news published abroad about it is inaccurate, fabricated, or likely to harm its relations with other countries, it may provide correct information to the publishing country for publication. If that country refuses to publish it, it may be submitted to the UN Secretariat's news agency for publication.</p>
<p>The convention contains twenty-three legally binding articles, the main ones guaranteeing freedom of movement for journalists and equal rights to access information, and prohibiting censorship in peacetime, except in matters of national defense.</p>
<p>Soviet Representative Gromyko launched fierce attacks during the debate on the convention in both the General Assembly Committee and the General Assembly itself, accusing it of strengthening the power of Western news monopolies to intensify defamatory propaganda against the Soviet Union and other Slavic countries. He delivered an hour-long speech, stating that the authors of the convention intended to gain opportunities to infiltrate other countries and spread hysteria-inducing news. Only the most prominent warmongers and war profiteers would benefit from the convention. American, British, French, and Italian newspapers have made it their profession to spread lies about the Soviet Union. They hope other countries will open their doors to their representatives masquerading as journalists, who will collect all kinds of information for the use of American and British intelligence agencies. This convention does not strengthen anti-fascism or prohibit war defeat propaganda, but instead gives free rein to the "Pulitzer" and "Forrestal" groups.</p>
<h3>American Political Parties and Politics</h3>
<p>— by Nevins</p>
<p>Although the history of American political parties is as old as the American government itself, the existence of vast national, state, and local organizations of parties, with local, state, and national conventions as the hubs of their activities, began with President Jackson's second term (1829-37). Fully developed party activity, especially the two-party system, is only about a hundred years old in the American context.</p>
<p>Do political parties have a healthy function? Some major leaders in Washington's time did not think so. They believed that parties only served to cause division and create disagreement. Good citizens of the new republic should reject parties. This view originated from a sound Roman spirit. This view was later expressed in Macaulay's poem: "Then none was for a party; Then all were for the state." Washington's unanimous election as President of the United States seemed to prove this ideal.</p>
<p>But the fact, described in a solemn statement by (third US President Jefferson), shattered this utopian theory. Political parties are necessary to express political views, educate the people, promote policies, and criticize the government. Jefferson said that parties are crucial to freedom. His words are simple: "In any free and deliberative society, according to human nature, there must be opposing factions, fierce disagreements, and differences of opinion; and one of these must necessarily prevail for a longer or shorter period. Perhaps this division into parties is necessary to exercise mutual oversight and to detail the actions of the other side to the people."</p>
<p>The initial division of American parties—Federalists and Republicans—like the two-party precedent in Great Britain, was inevitable. Washington acknowledged the two parties when selecting his first cabinet. In the national and aristocratic aspect, he chose Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury and Knox as Secretary of War. Among the democrats, he chose Jefferson as Secretary of State and Randolph as Attorney General. The disagreements in cabinet meetings were perhaps no less than the disagreements in the country. A few years later, both parties underwent formal reorganization, and every American knew that their struggle would determine the trend of constitutional development. The Federalists and Republicans each strived to have the government governed according to their methods, just as the Whigs and Tories sought to shape the unwritten British constitution.</p>
<p>Here, there is a point of principled divergence. The main purpose of the Federalists was to enable the articles of the Constitution to expand the power of the federal government. The main purpose of the Jeffersonian party was to make the Constitution sufficient to limit the federal government and increase local power. Two opposing ideas clashed, but from the beginning, three factors weakened the intensity of party conflict.</p>
<p>What were they? (1) The principle itself is a tempered beauty deduced for preservation and correction, and subject to sudden changes occurring for the sake of expediency. Therefore, once Jefferson came to power, he indeed made more extensive use of the federal government than Adams had, such as the Louisiana Purchase (purchased from France in 1803, the land from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian border, which later became fourteen central US states), and at that time, the good Democrat Jackson was proving to be a staunch advocate of a strong federal government. (2) Both parties paid attention to all kinds of subsidiary issues, such as tariffs, domestic reform, and foreign policy. When they paid such attention, both parties appealed to constantly fluctuating groups. (3) Each party had a healthy reputation for listening to public sentiment, so the majority could not abuse power, and the minority, obeying the majority, had a tacit understanding that no abuse of power would occur.</p>
<p>Why does the two-party system exist?</p>
<p>From Hamilton to the present day, there are many reasons why the two-party system has been able to endure. One is that in a populous democracy, the expense of maintaining a national party every four years is unaffordable for many small splinter parties. Secondly, most great leaders rise and become influential within the two main parties. But most importantly, the two-party system suits the genius of the people. They demand a responsible authority, thereby achieving stability; they demand that it be monitored by a strong opposition party; they demand the use of its power, but this is done through compromise, while giving due attention to the rights of the minority.</p>
<p>Is such a party system democratic? Before the American Civil War, the Democratic Party was controlled by a limited group of slave owners, who donated money and effort to the party more enthusiastically than any other group. After the Civil War, the Republican Party was controlled by big business for a long time, but the party's institutions, through direct primaries, improved propaganda, and campaign donation restrictions, have been improved, so that broader control can be achieved. If there is anything that needs to be improved, it can be obtained. The complexity within each party allows for the realization of democracy.</p>
<p>If there is any lesson in American history, it is that undemocratically controlled parties will sooner or later suffer severe punishment. Rebellious elements will gather among party members, and reform groups will rise up against servile oligarchies, or large corporations, or any other manipulative group. They joined the opposition party, and the "independent" faction's participation was so great that they played a decisive role in promoting more democratic management of party affairs.</p>
<p>This American system is rarely understood, so that several critics repeatedly raise a question: "Why can't we have a conservative party and a liberal party?" This statement really neglects the main function of the two major parties. Because the two major parties are a mixture rather than a solvent. Their basic value in the United States is to bring together a large number of different social groups, economic groups, ethnic groups, and rights of various regions to achieve collaborative governance.</p>
<p>The greatest disaster in American history, the Civil War, was caused by temporary party divisions formed by region. The worst disaster that could happen to the United States in the future would be a division along economic and class lines. The American people have many reasons to feel joyful rather than distressed because the Democratic and Republican parties are so similar that the transfer of power from one party to another does not cause violent shocks.</p>
<p>Represents a cross-section of the people</p>
<p>Most importantly, each party is quite able to represent a cross-section of the nation, including the rich and the poor, farmers and city clerks, Catholics, Jews, and Christians, natives and immigrants. The vast differences in wealth prevent any division between the rich and the poor. But suppose the United States really had a Conservative Party composed of property owners and a Radical Party composed of the propertyless, then it could be expected that the party that ultimately failed in the elections would build all kinds of obstacles in the streets.</p>
<p>The American-style two-party system also has its obvious shortcomings. Obviously, parties that are too large, too loose, and too inconsistent are prone to causing division. It is equally obvious that these large parties, which need to constantly seek agreements between all levels, are inevitably difficult to be consistent. When the American Civil War crisis was very deep, President Lincoln, after the failure at Fredericksburg, in order to unite the Republican Party, attempted to obtain the resignations of Seward, the darling of the conservatives within the party, and Chase, the darling of the radicals, in order to balance the two factions. This was a very effective method, but it cannot be interpreted as the highest political path.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the benefits of the current existing system outweigh its shortcomings. The entire tradition is to build the government on a strong and responsible majority, which will effectively hold power, but will also respect the rights of the minority. Americans believe that entrusting the two major parties is relatively safer because they protect the rights of the minority through limitations and checks and balances. They believe it is safer because even the most powerful presidents—Jackson, Lincoln, Wilson, and the two Roosevelts—have not shown any dictatorial tendencies, although those short-lived party members have made contrary claims.</p>
<p>The United States is also unwilling to give up the broad benefits created by the fact that both major parties can represent every element of different societies. Third parties are never like this; they often represent one idea—abolition, prohibition, populism—so they are only one group. In such a country that is so large, with such diverse resources, climates, and economic and social interests, and with such complex people and their beliefs, promoting unity is an important condition for these parties. In this people who have and enhance their emotions regarding changing problems, a party organization based on the principles of unity and compromise is obviously very valuable.</p>
<p>The nature of the American political institutions has changed surprisingly little from the time of Hamilton and Jefferson to the present. We can say that the stability of the United States is largely due to this fact. (Translated by the US Information Service)</p>

The price fluctuations will be subject to flexible adjustments based on circumstances.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Deposit Receipts and Payments Between Banking Institutions to Be Handled by the Clearing House Starting Today</h3>
<p>[East China News Agency] The Shanghai Clearing House has received an official letter from the Central Bank stating that the exchange of deposit receipts and payments for clearing accounts of all banking institutions will be handled exclusively by the Clearing House, starting from the 16th of this month (today). Previously, the balance of exchange accounts of all banks and money houses in the city was deposited in two locations: those with clearing numbers before 50 (the "large exchange") were deposited with the National Bank, while those with numbers 50 and above (the "small exchange") were deposited with the Clearing House. Under the new regulations, all will be handled by the Clearing House. Therefore, the balances of deposit accounts originally opened at the National Bank by the "large exchange" banking institutions with numbers before 50 have been settled by the National Bank as of the 14th (last Saturday) and will be transferred to the Clearing House this morning. These banking institutions can issue checks from the National Bank this morning and deposit them into the Clearing House to open clearing deposit accounts for exchange balance receipts and payments. From now on, the clearing of checks for all banks and money houses in the city will be unified by the Clearing House, and the terms "large exchange" and "small exchange" have become relics of financial history. It is reported that the total amount of deposits of banking institutions with numbers before 50 at the National Bank reaches 1 trillion yuan, and all of it will be transferred from the National Bank to the Clearing House this morning, after which the banking institutions will issue checks from the National Bank Business Department and send them to the Clearing House for transfer to the National Bank Business Department for accounting.</p>
<h3>New Home Designs</h3>
<p>Translated Article from the United States Information Service</p>
<p>Forward-looking architects in the United States who are engaged in the design of future homes and buildings are already anticipating startling changes in the construction of houses. In terms of its development potential, advances in architecture will gradually evolve from experimental designs to practical manufacturing.</p>
<p>Future sunlight will not enter homes through windows in the walls, but will be attracted by the entire building, filtered, and appropriately combined with artificial light to create an integrated environment that meets specific requirements. Many of these necessary materials and equipment are already readily available. First, there is a mysterious control tool—the photoelectric cell. This photoelectric cell can sense the slightest changes in light. It is now being used to turn on and off lights in classrooms, open and close classroom doors, and count the number of people entering a classroom. This is almost a reasonable way to automatically control any kind of light problem.</p>
<p>Mechanically Movable Active Walls are now a common thing in American industry, and many houses are now equipped with active roofs that can be slid to one side with the push of a button. Huge metal and plastic blinds will be automatically controlled by machines to adjust the sunlight.</p>
<p>Future buildings will all use glass that can transmit ultraviolet rays, because ordinary glass blocks ultraviolet rays. This type of glass will also block infrared rays, which ordinary glass mostly lets in. The toilets used will not be a mixture of blinds, frosted glass, and curtains, but will be replaced by a kind of "one-way" glass, which can see out but cannot be seen in. Or they will be replaced by another polarized glass, which can block the line of sight with a light flick of the finger.</p>
<p>Temperature regulation</p>
<p>Now, it seems that there is no reason why the steel frame that supports concrete floors and ceilings cannot take on the dual task of a heating coil. Resistance coils built into the walls can be installed so that they can become a source of heat when connected to electricity.</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty with radiant cooling systems is condensation when summer temperatures are high. In such cases, the moisture on the radiating surface is like a glass of water filled with ice water. Therefore, it limits this type of radiant cooling to areas with lower summer humidity, or to buildings where the air can be artificially dried. But the development of chemicals that can absorb moisture in the air, such as silica and potassium chloride, indicates that a simple and effective chemical method of drying the air will soon be successful. This can greatly increase indoor comfort in the summer, even without the use of cooling tools.</p>
<p>Radiant mechanisms solve a variety of complex architectural problems that were previously thought to be unsolvable. For example, in hospital operating rooms, patients need to be warmer during surgery, while stressed doctors want a lower temperature. Because too low a temperature can cause death for patients during surgery, and doctors are merely uncomfortable at high temperatures, doctors often accommodate patients and operate at higher temperatures. But with a source of radiation, it is possible to warm the patient with hot air on the one hand, and to "focus" the cold radiation on the doctor from the walls on the other hand to keep them cool.</p>
<p>Solar Heat</p>
<p>Solar water heaters in California and Florida have achieved considerable results by extracting ample heat from the sun each year, although these water heaters are very primitive. Now it is clear that what is needed is a way to convert "energy" into a form that is easy to store. In this regard, nature provides a technology—photochemistry. Assuming that we complete the process of mimicking the way the most common weeds use and store "energy," the design of houses will be greatly and happily modified. This work belongs to physicists and chemists. Once this problem is solved, it will be possible to use the sunlight that falls on the surface of the house to raise and lower the temperature of the house at any temperature. We can therefore also use the "surface" of the house to directly transmit thermal "energy" into the interior when temperature is needed, and to isolate it from the outside when no force is needed, while making it into charcoal, alcohol, or electricity, and storing it for future use.</p>
<p>Kitchen</p>
<p>There are already various predictions about the kitchen of tomorrow. An interesting trend is to place dishes and other utensils in cabinets at waist height. In the past, there was only one stove, but in the future, there will be a set of special kitchen utensils. As rapid cooling methods become more widely used, this same method can be used in refrigerators, with various appliances for different cooling, freezing, and quick-freezing.</p>
<p>We have many hopes. But many of the most difficult problems still await practical solutions. For example, dishwashing and garbage disposal are such problems. From a hygienic point of view, paper or plastic dishes that are discarded after only one use are an idea that is moving in the right direction. Even more satisfactory would be a simple and inexpensive dishwasher with infrared light to complete quick drying and sterilization. Similarly, except for farm kitchens, ordinary kitchens need a simple way to dispose of garbage. Grinding garbage into powder with an electric grinder and then pouring it into the sewer is perhaps the most effective method today.</p>
<p>Other kitchen appliances are still waiting for testing in the laboratory: for example, transparent stoves and cooking pots with internal lighting, high-frequency induction cooking, rotating utensil racks, and so on.</p>
<p>Bathroom</p>
<p>If the United States is famous for one thing, it is the degree of access to bathrooms that we each have. Although the bathroom has become the first successful tool in American society for removing scum from the body, it is still far from ideal. The basic drawback of the bathtub is that the water becomes increasingly turbid while washing the body. The basic advantage of the shower is that the bather is not clearing the body in stagnant water, but in flowing water. If the two are combined, it is very desirable—a constantly changing stream of water slowly flowing in a bathtub. This type of bathroom is already commonly used in medical institutions. If it is applied elsewhere, it will prompt it to be improved and have more precise pistons to control the water temperature and volume. Further research will undoubtedly create a bathtub that is less slippery, easier to clean, and feels more comfortable.</p>
<p>Commonly used toilets do not have the correct shape, height, and angle. In the future, toilets will be lower and angled very sharply downward and backward. The seat connected to the toilet will be automatically disinfected after each use. There are already several patented styles and designs in which the seat pops out into a disinfection box in the back, which can kill various parasites with water flow or ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>After use, the flushing toilet will no longer be flushed with waves of water, but with a thin layer of water to clean the entire inner wall of the toilet. This toilet will have a ventilation device. It will no longer be made of the current porcelain, but will be made of metal and plastic woven inner walls. Future flushing toilets will use knee and foot control switches. Like bathtubs, future toilets will also have flowing water instead of stagnant water. Furthermore, technically speaking, there is no reason why it cannot be reduced in weight to ten or fifteen pounds.</p>
<p>Aerial Housing</p>
<p>In 1946, the architect Weidukai designed a roof suspended by balloons for the outdoor opera theater in St. Louis. This outdoor theater is only used on summer nights, and the theater does not need a roof above it to make it a permanent building, but summer showers are very annoying. Therefore, he designed a transparent balloon filled with helium, which floats above the outdoor theater. If a sudden heavy rain occurs, a canopy made of fiberglass fabric will be lowered along nylon ropes. All of this is controlled by a motor installed in the basket outside the airship, which also houses equipment for controlling the stage lighting. Thus, when not needed, the entire mechanism can be parked elsewhere on the ground.</p>

<h3>Prehistoric Remains Discovered in Qingjiang Dagu Mountain: Over a Hundred Pieces of Earthen City Stone Tools, All Belonging to the Black Pottery Culture System</h3>
<p>[Changsha News] Since the discovery of the Qingjiang Dagu Mountain prehistoric site, it has indeed attracted the attention of domestic scholars. According to the discoverer, Rao Huimin's two years of investigation, there are already three sites this time, among which the Dagu Mountain Earth City yielded more than a hundred pieces of stone tools, including axes, knives, shovels, hand grinding discs, grinding sticks, and other types; more than three thousand catties of pottery shards, including black, white, gray pottery, and various items such as steel ore and textiles.</p>
<p>Recently, Rao Huimin, while passing through another hilly field, discovered three smaller earth cities, only half a li apart, covering areas of about five to seven mu each. In these three earth cities, he also found hundreds of pottery and stone items. The stone tools included axes, knives, grinding discs. The pottery shards featured patterns such as continuous patterns, mat patterns, grid patterns, wave patterns, swastika grid patterns, and over ten other types, as well as several flat, cone-shaped tripod legs, which were relics from the same period as those discovered in the former Dagu Earth City.</p>
<p>Currently, there are seven prehistoric sites discovered in Qingjiang, each surrounded by an earth city. These seven sites are all located near the overflow edge of the Gan River, within about forty li of each other. Therefore, it can be proven that the earth cities, of varying sizes, are the fortified residential sites of ancient tribal times, not cities or military defense projects of later generations. It is conceivable that the population in the Jiangnan area at that time was quite dense, and the ancient culture in the Gan River basin was also very substantial.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to Rao Huimin's research on the earliest discovered Dagu Mountain Earth City site, more than one-third of its relics belong to the Black Pottery Culture system. The colors are divided into glossy black, deep black, brownish-black, grayish-black, and brownish-yellow, etc. The pottery is classified into clay and mixed sand types, with varying amounts of sand mixed in, and contains quartz grains and mica flakes. The decorations include blue patterns, stripe patterns, grid patterns, rope patterns, and string patterns, with plain surfaces still predominating. There is also a type of twisted spiral decoration, made by pressing with the tip of the thumb, which is quite simple and beautiful. Comparing its color, quality, decoration, and production style, it is very similar to the black pottery unearthed in Longshan, Liangzhu, and other places.</p>
<p>Therefore, the discovery of black pottery at the Qingjiang prehistoric site is of great relevance to the speculation of the spread of the Longshan Black Pottery Culture, and the research on prehistoric culture in Jiangnan. Currently, the discoverer, Mr. Rao Huimin, is preparing to write an investigation report on the Qingjiang prehistoric site for the research of domestic and foreign archaeological experts.</p>
<h3>The Case of Zhong Liezhao, an Air Force Mechanical Officer in Hankou, Killing His Wife: His Cousin Lie Lian Is Indicted</h3>
<p>[Hankou News] Last November in Hankou, an Air Force mechanical officer named Zhong Liezhao conspired with his cousin Zhong Lielian to murder his wife, Zhu Xiulan, with double nails. The details were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the criminal Zhong Lielian has been arrested in Xingguo County, Jiangxi, and has been transferred to the Hankou Local Court for investigation. According to reports, the perpetrator, Zhong Liezhao, had another lover and became increasingly disgusted with his wife, Xiulan. Zhong Lielian also harbored animosity towards his sister-in-law. On the evening of November 8th last year, Zhong Liezhao had an argument with his wife. He then conspired with his cousin Zhong Lielian to tightly close the doors and windows late at night, violently strangling Zhu Xiulan's neck with gauze and stabbing her temples with iron nails, causing her death. Recently, the prosecutor of the Hankou Local Court conducted a detailed investigation of the arrested Zhong Lielian and determined that the evidence of the crime was conclusive. He has been indicted according to law. However, the perpetrator's brother, Zhong Lieyan, is actively lobbying in Hankou to exonerate him and has reportedly secretly bribed a certain official, Mr. Lan (from Zhangshu, Jiangxi), of the ×× Court to intercede on his behalf. However, as the perpetrator participated in the crime, and the Hankou Local Court Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution, it will be difficult for him to escape punishment. The sentencing is of great concern to all parties. The full text of the indictment from the Hankou Local Court Prosecutor is recorded below:</p>
<p>Defendant: Zhong Lielian, male, twenty-three years old, from Qian County, Jiangxi, student, residing at Zhong Hongchang No. on Zhongshan Road, Xingguo, Jiangxi.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned defendant's murder case No. 291 (urgent) of the 37th year of the Republic of China has been concluded after investigation. It is believed that a prosecution should be initiated. The facts of the crime, evidence, and legal provisions are described as follows: Zhong Lielian is the cousin of Zhong Liezhao, a mechanical officer in the supply and inspection division of the Sixth Supply Branch of the Air Force. He came to Hankou and resided in Liezhao's dormitory to prepare for school exams. Liezhao had another lover and became increasingly disgusted with his wife, Zhu Xiulan. They argued many times, and Lielian also harbored animosity towards his sister-in-law. On the evening of November 8th last year, the couple had another argument. Later, Liezhao conspired with Lielian to tightly close the doors and windows late at night, strangling Zhu Xiulan's neck with gauze and stabbing her temples with iron nails, causing her death. The Liezhao brothers locked the door and fled separately. Later, their colleagues, suspecting something, opened the door the next afternoon at 5:00 PM and discovered Zhu Xiulan's body lying on the bed. They reported it to the police station, who requested an examination and investigation. Zhong Liezhao's part has been referred to the Fourth Military Region Command of the Air Force for investigation. Zhong Lielian's part has been apprehended by the Xingguo County Government of Jiangxi at the request of Zhu Xiulan's brother, Zhu Tonglian, and transferred to the court.</p>
<p>The body of Zhu Xiulan was found lying supine on the bed in the bedroom on the third floor of the Air Force Supply Group dormitory at No. 382 Shengli Street in this city. There were injuries on each of the left and right eyebrows, cyan-purple hard swelling, uneven circles, surrounding four cun two fen, with bloodstains, all wooden instrument injuries, each with a small hole broken inside, half a fen deep on the left, reaching the bone on the right, fresh blood flowed, stabbed by iron nails. Around the neck, there was a gauze strip, circling the neck, the knot in front, the scar was purple-brown, with bloodstains, blood halo, strangled to death. The wrists and backs of both hands, a piece of purple-red bloodstains, each with finger marks, two purple-dark spots on the back of the left hand, three purple ridge spots on the back of the right hand, each as large as a fingertip, injured by someone's hand before death, verified by this court's Inspector Ao, confirming that she was strangled at the neck and injured in the temples before death, a medical report is on file. During the examination, Air Force intern officer Chuan Jingxun testified: "After eating dinner on Monday the 8th, the couple and a cousin surnamed Zhong were still in the room. At that time, the three were in the room and there was no quarrel. Later, Zhong Liezhao's brother went out. I went to the street at 8:00 PM that night and didn't come home until after 9:00 PM. I heard fighting noises coming from their room. I knocked on their door, and the noise stopped. After we returned to our room, they started fighting again. I immediately went downstairs and called the mechanical officer Liu Chude. Then we went upstairs again and knocked on their door. For more than a quarter of an hour, there was no sound coming from inside. Later, we left. The next morning, we saw that their door was locked. It wasn't until 5:00 PM that I and Liu Jiande opened the door and found Mrs. Zhong dead in the bed," and Liu Jiande also provided the same information. When the cook Jia Rongtang was asked, "Do you know their brother?" he answered, "I also know Zhong Lielian. I live downstairs, and they live upstairs. I only heard loud noises upstairs, but I didn't see them taking anything away." It is certain that Zhong Lielian was in Hankou that day. However, the defendant claimed that he took a car to Zhuzhou on the 7th of that month, which is obviously false. Since the defendant was in Hankou and lived in the same room as his brother and sister-in-law, who can believe that his sister-in-law was murdered without his involvement? Also, according to the defendant, Zhong Liezhao's mother lived in the room, but according to Zhong Liechun, his mother had already gone home, which proves that the defendant's words are evasive. There are suspicions of crimes under Article 28 and Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and the court is requested to adjudicate.</p>
<h3>Domestically Produced Motor Vehicles in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou News] The production of motor vehicles in our country is still the first to be seen in the Guangzhou market after the war. Motor vehicles manufactured by Xingye Machinery Factory are already running on the market. They are often seen speeding through the streets, adding to the color of traffic. The reporter visited the factory's sales department and workshop, and the impressions obtained are reported as follows, in order to enlighten readers:</p>
<p>No. 19 Jiaoyu Road is the factory's sales department, located in a quiet and convenient place. Various colored vehicles are displayed, attracting a large number of spectators. They all look closely with a curious mind. The technicians there are busy explaining the structure, performance, and driving methods of the car to the audience, as well as all the questions that general customers want to know. The head of the sales department, Mr. He, greeted the reporter with a kind smile and explained the products that have been achieved after two years of experimentation and improvement: such as saving fuel, suitable for China's economic situation, and easy to drive, aiming to popularize applications. He also gave a detailed description of the entire manufacturing process. He also instructed the technicians to conduct an actual demonstration in public. Mr. He also invited the reporter to try driving. After listening to all the steps, the reporter was able to drive without any difficulty, deeply feeling the ease of operation. After starting, sitting on the car and stepping on the ground with both feet, just rotate the rubber tube held by the right hand, and the car will move forward slowly. Wait for the speed to increase and balance before lifting both feet to the pedals. Then the speed of the car is controlled only by twisting the rubber tube on the right hand to the left and right. After more than ten minutes of galloping and inspection, it is felt that it is even easier to drive than an ordinary bicycle. Because the car body is light and compact, the height is moderate, the center of gravity is low and the center of gravity is wide, so there is no difficulty in supporting it at all. Driving can be said to be absolutely safe. This achievement is particularly brilliant in China's industrial sector!</p>
<p>In order to understand the manufacturing situation of the factory in the field, the reporter went to the factory headquarters for a visit. The factory director was instructed to enter the workshop, where dozens of young technicians and apprentices were concentrating on various tasks. Each department had specialized personnel to supervise and guide, and the work atmosphere was quite tense. Various machine equipment was very complete, including several working machines, which were said to be the only ones in the city. The only regret is that the factory area seemed to be too small, which made the storage of assembled vehicles somewhat cramped. Seeing various accessories that have not been constructed, have been constructed, and are being constructed, it is enough to prove that they are purely domestic products.</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Huang bought a car. The reporter believed that he should be able to understand the advantages and disadvantages of driving after using it for a month, so he immediately asked him about it. He said that after buying this car, the suffering of "traveling" has been completely solved. The money and time spent on long-distance buses and tricycles in the past can now be reduced by five to ten times. There have been no problems in more than a month. Only once, it was driven away by his friend, but it was left on the roadside, which delayed some time. Because he only knew that driving was easy, he ignored asking for the knowledge that should be possessed, so after the engine died, he did not know how to start it. Therefore, Yu Yi said that the factory must print a simple instruction manual and attach it to the car so that every driver can temporarily understand the methods they should do, which will definitely reduce a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>From what I have learned, the factory can have this product, which is a great contribution to transportation, especially being able to ensure driving safety and reduce the occurrence of accidents, is one of its characteristics; in a country with backward industry like China, most people do not have a deep understanding of machinery, which leads to the psychology of seeing machines as difficult and troublesome. However, this car is made in the simplest way, which is the second of its characteristics; the speed and impact force are very moderate, and the Haizhu Bridge and Guanyin Mountain can go up and down freely, and the fuel consumption is economical, which is also the third of its characteristics; in terms of application, its price is almost three times different from imported products, which is very suitable for China's economic capacity. Secondly, the service spirit of the factory staff should be commended, that is, they can always fulfill their responsibilities to customers and audiences, whether it is teaching driving, maintenance and use, or even if there is any difficult problem to solve, if you tell them by phone, the factory can send someone to drive to assist within a few minutes. In short, in our country with backward science and unstable economy, it is rare to overcome various difficulties and achieve this achievement, but it is still hoped that the factory can strengthen its publicity efforts and print more instructions for the car to arouse the general interest in machinery, then the future is unlimited.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Legal Explanation: Housing Dispute Issues</h3>
<p>Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi</p>
<p>Wu Ming Asks: A certain friend, Jia, rented a house from Yi in the 33rd year of the Republic of China, specifying a term of one year, and Jia paid Yi a deposit of 15,000 Chu banknotes as a transfer fee. If Jia does not move out after the term expires, Yi can demand that Jia transfer the entire house to him for 200,000 general legal tender, without any excuses. Later, due to the situation, Jia did not move out after the term expired. Recently, Yi passed away, and his son-in-law, Bing, asked Ding to jointly demand that Jia pay for Yi's funeral expenses, otherwise, he would fulfill the previous agreement and demand Jia move out within a time limit. There are several questions, please answer them.</p>
<p>(1) Is this housing contract established during the enemy-puppet period still valid now? (2) After the expiration of this contract, the two parties did not revise the contract, but continued to live for four years. Now the lessor still wants to handle the matter according to the original contract and demand that the lessee give up the house. Does this contract still have lease rights? (3) Assuming that this contract has lost its lease rights, and the lessor wants to transfer the entire house to others in the name of handling the funeral, or transfer a part of the lessee's residence to others, and then force the lessee to move out, is it permitted by current law? (4) When the lessee entered the house at that time, he had paid 15,000 yuan in general currency. Is this fee considered a transfer fee? (5) If the lessor asks the lessee to subsidize any expenses in the name of handling the funeral, can it be rejected? (6) If the lessor privately transfers part of the house occupied by the lessee to others for three taels of gold, is it a crime in law? (7) This contract did not have stamp duty affixed at the time. Is this contract valid? (8) But the lessee is really in difficulty and unable to move out. To prevent future safety, should he register with the local police station in advance?</p>
<p>[Answer] (1) A private contract, agreed upon by both parties, is valid. Therefore, a lease established even during the enemy-puppet period should also be considered valid. (2) For a fixed-term lease, if the lessee continues to pay rent after the term expires, and the lessor continues to collect rent, then a non-fixed-term lease relationship has been established between the two parties, and the lessee has obtained lease rights. (3) Illegal forced eviction is of course not permitted by law. (4) If there is a payment in addition to the rent, whether it is a transfer fee or a security deposit, it depends on the evidence recognized by both parties. (5) There is no reason for the lessor's family to ask the lessee to subsidize the funeral expenses. If it is for relief purposes, it should be discussed separately. (6) The Shanghai Municipal Government has repeatedly ordered that transfer fees are not allowed to be received. If there is a private transfer, it can be reported to the Land Administration Bureau. (7) The validity of a contract is not affected by stamp duty. Missing stamp duty will only be punished and supplemented according to the Stamp Duty Law, and will not cause the contract to become invalid. (8) You can explain the situation to the local police station so that there is a basis in case of future incidents.</p>
<h3>Scenes of Jin City</h3>
<p>The rise in prices is getting faster and faster. They roll over every two or three o'clock. More than 600,000 citizens in Chengdu, more than 200,000 are unemployed, most of them are retired officials and leisurely landlords and their relatives. Their consumption has increased, but their income has decreased considerably. The lives of nine out of ten families are not as good as before, and they often complain. Some people are even preparing to disperse to the countryside.</p>
