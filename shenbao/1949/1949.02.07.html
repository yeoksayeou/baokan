<p>〔本報南京六日電〕五日甫目漢抵京之黃紹竑氏，六日晨續謁李代總統後，午間乘機飛滬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕甘介侯此次來滬奔走兩日，已將本市和平代表團組織竣事。甘氏昨晨十時半再度飛京，謁李代總統請示行期，並研究進行和談之技術問題，預計二日內可與邵力子同機返滬後，卽行啓程·本市各和平代表正靜待甘氏歸來後，再定行期，昨日彼此間無正式會議舉行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕僕僕於京滬道上之甘介侯，六日午自滬乘機飛返京。甘氏下機後，卽驅車往謁李代總統報告，並訪黃紹竑，黃旭初，邵力子等，交換和平問題意見。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕甘介侯六日抵京後，自午迄晚均在李代總統官邸，詳商和談有關問題，六日晚十時許曾與邵力子通電話，約定於七日晤談，甘氏已定八日晨乘機飛滬。</p>

<h3>孫院長談話　政府南移並非遷都　對和平繼續努力　交出戰犯問題決予嚴拒</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州六日電〕行政院長孫科六日下午在此間招待記者，據稱：此為渠就任行政院長後首次正式招待記者，氏首述組閣經過，略謂：當時卽決定為謀取「光榮和平」，而絕非投降內閣，渠一向主張以和平解決國內問題，惟應求合理解決，而絕不能以武力屈服而談和平。此次政府遷穗，係為避免戰火威脅，因政府所求者為和平，絕不能作城下之盟，自蔣總統引退後，經與各方磋商遷穗辦法，並請示李代總統，於一月廿五日始作最後決定，當時李代總統及各院部首長多人在坐，一致同意，遂於廿六日通知各使團，故此次實由李代總統指示下決定，並非政院獨行。政府僅係遷地辦公，而並非遷都，政院遷後，政府在不受戰火威脅下，仍將為和平努力。溯自蔣總統文告發表後，政院卽聲明響應要求雙方先停戰，再派代表商談，免百姓慘受戰爭痛苦，惟共方竟認此為關閉和平之門，頗使人費解，後蔣總統宣告引退，表示謀和決心，並卽推定五代表，準備與共黨從事和談，惟共黨又稱：「須俟完全解放北平」後始決定，然至今迄無消息。最近一週，李代總統亦以坐待並非辦法，故主張由上海各界先派代表先敲和平之門，惟彼等何時可起程，現尙未悉，然政府對此仍不灰心，因本人一向反對內戰，且此次任務卽為促進和平。氏並稱：勝利後，曾有若干人士主張以戰爭解決國內問題，本人卽極力反對，現彼等主戰者已覺恐懼，因為如淸算舊賬，則說來話長矣。目前政府為求百姓安居樂業，生活得一適當水準，同時與東西友邦均能親善，故遷地辦公，以為和平努力。氏末對記者詢問答稱：（一）全體閣員共十八人，已到穗十二人，定七日正式召開政務會議。（二）立監兩院院長已抵此，並無反對政府遷移之議。（三）李代總統並無下令各部院遷回南京之指示，在和平還未實現前，自應密切聯緊。（四）政府遷穗後，係整體行動，渠與李代總統意見並無相左。（五）和平並未完全絕望。（六）李代總統曾有來穗表示，（七）渠何時返京未定，（八）京·滬絕對可保無處。（九）絕對嚴厲拒絕交出戰犯，萬一和平不能實現，祗有與共黨週旋到底。</p>

<p>〔中央社西安五日電〕東北　宿莫德惠氏，為救濟在陝東北難胞，年前由京匯來救濟款十萬元，託由此間東北局鄉會代為分發，該會經登記完畢，自五日起發放，計大口一百廿元，小口六十元，計共登記難民七百九十二人。</p>

<h3>安定公敎人員的生活！</h3>
<p>滬市交通復且各大學教授會，二月五日聯合舉行教授聯誼會首次會議，會中討論改善教授待遇問題，決定代電李代總統·行政院·及教育部呼籲，說明目前教授月入祗合銀元一元半，且物價猶在上漲，請迅予設法改善。此外他們並要求發給應變費與儲糧費三個月，均以發款時之物價指數為準。上項電文日內即可發出，它是苦難中教授羣的悲嗚，也是全國公教人員在高物價壓迫下的一種呼聲，我們除了同情這種沉痛的呼籲以外，並願喚起政府當局密切的注意。</p>
<p>三年戰亂以來，物價飛漲不已，人民生活，水深火熱，尤以公教人員為最。全國公教人員生活在苦難中，發生了許多可哀可泣的悲劇，幾無一日不在喘息中掙扎，希冀國家早登太平之境，民生得以復蘇。政府在些三年中，對公教人員似已有所關懷，惟物價狂跳，政府所定的待遇調整，轉瞬又急趨下降。現在公教人員的待遇，係按金圓券發給，其計算方式和標準，依「八一九」基數加倍發給，京滬等地則為十五倍。去年臘底，因時局動盪，曾經加薪一月，然終屆杯水車薪，無濟於事·數月以來，公教人員依然在苦痛生活中，而尤以京滬區公教人員的淸苦為最甚。</p>
<p>大學教授在學術上技術上，佔有高超的地位；他們的生活與素養，浸潤於精神環境中，堅守教育本位生活，為國家盡責，為教育盡職。他們本不應有物質生活的煩擾，他們更不應受衣食兒女負擔的鞭策，以致失去正常的生活態度，影響其治學研究二如果他們的生活態度，受了客觀的影響與頓挫，這是國家的損失，教育的不幸！然而今天最嚴重的事實，就是驅使教育界人士，同多數中下級公務人員一樣，走向了貧窮，走向了苦難。浙江大學校畏竺可楨氏，今年一月八日對本報杭州記者說。。「近來學校經費情形很壞，述火都生不起。」全校師生在寒風中苦讀。又說：「教授薪給的平均數，每人僅能得金圓券七百元，只買得到一担米，假如一位教授有一位太太，還有兩個孩子，，試問如何維持？眼看物價恐怕還要漲上去！」又復旦大學二百七十八位教授，為要求改善待遇，今年一月十四日曾電呈教育部呼籲說：「自政府金融及物價政策一再更變之後，四個月來上海物價猛漲四十餘倍，而同人等每月所得薪津僅台幣制改革時薪額之五倍，區區之數，實難維持生活。目下同人等典質殆盡，借貸無門，乃作緊急呼籲。」可是，這種沉痛的呼籲，並無任何的結果與反映；教靑都部長遠飛廣州，次長雖逗留上海而一籌莫展，教授代表去見他，他竟所答非所問，好激這樣與教育切身有關的事，不在主官想像之中。今天的物價已漲至二百五十倍到三百倍，一般公教人員淸苦之狀，更可想見，難道政府大員依然可以熟視無賭？</p>
<p>現在，全國最大多數的教育界人士，就在上述物質精神雙重壓迫下堅苦地奮鬥着，站立着，他們的偉大和負責，眞是可歌可泣，而不是一個新聞記者的一枝禿筆所能形容。今天教育界人士的處境，我們萬分同情；但祗是仗了我們文人的精神同情是不够的，因而我們願提醒政府當局的注意，為了搶救教育危機，為了安定公教人員生活。甚至為了養士用士，都應該迅即調整公教人員的待遇。交大復旦各校教授聯誼會的呼籲，是陳布雷先生所謂「油盡燈桔」時燃燒的一點希望。這個希望，當局不應把它撲滅：相反地，合理的應該培養這個希望，纔能達到培養教育文化底目的。</p>

<h3>美國物價水準　一般開始下落</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓一日電〕世界商品的價格在十年來不斷上昇以後，現在已開始其下落的趨勢。許多基本商品價格的跌落程度已很可觀，跌價的趨勢且逐漸及於其他商品。垣街雜誌登載的道瓊斯未來商品指數，已經指明世界的購買者都以為這個下落的趨勢尙將繼續。這個指數反映購買者所估計，今後五個月內十一種重要商品的價格，是以美國商品市塲的未來商業交易為基礎。最近所發表的指數，是一九四七年中以來最低的水準，比一九四七年最高指數低達百分之二十二以上。</p>
<p>美國的購買零售物品的普通平民，剛開始注意物價的變化，糧食的價格似乎减小，男女衣着，傢供，家庭用具，皮毛等物品舉行大廉價時，其價格亦有顯著的降低。舊汽車價格大量跌落，但大體上說，舊汽車零售價格比過去跌落不多，新汽車價格高了些。建築材料也並不便宜多少。</p>
<p>原料價格方面跌落最為顯著，原料價格最後會反映在消費者購買的商品價格，而原料中則以所謂二十八種「敏感」的基本商品的價格，最表演出猛烈的跌落。在這二十八種商品中，供給與需求的變化最快也最自由。</p>
<p>政府編製的這一類物品的指數，在正月卅一日那一天是二八三，〇七（一九三九年八月為一〇〇），這比戰後的最高記錄低落約百分之二十。其中數種物品的價格，則比一九四六年六月廿八日美國物價管制取銷時的價格水準來得低。</p>
<p>這二十八種商品內的橡皮與絲，比過去物價管制時的水準低落得很多。這一部份是由於橡皮與絲都受到人造橡皮與人造絲的競爭。玉蜀黍·大麥與牛羊脂肪的價格，比一九四六年六月的管制價格稍微低一些，猪油價格則略為升高。</p>
<p>豬油牛羊油脂與絲的價格，下降最為猛烈，比戰後最高峯要低百分之六十至七十。棉子油·玉蜀黍·大麥·可可豆及印花布等物品的價格，要低百分之四十至六十。小麥·豬·牡犢·牛油·橡皮·麻子·麻布·樹脂·獸皮等物價格，則低百分之二十三至三十三。</p>
<p>價格的趨勢，還沒有顯著的影響到主要的金屬價格，但廢鋼與廢銅的價格已經下跌，而鋼及其他品的黑市（保險價格）已開始消滅。</p>
<p>原料的跌價趨勢，巳開始反映在批發與消費者零售物價上。政府每週編製的九百　不同商品的批發價格水準，在上週跌到一九二六年平均數的百分之一五八·八，這是一九四七年十一月初以來的最低水準，比上年八月的戰後最高峯則低百分之六·五。</p>
<p>大城市內中等收入的家庭，所須償付的零售價格，四月來逐漸降低，去年九月創造了最高峯，當時政府的每月消費品價格指數，達到一九三五年至四〇年平均數的百分之一百七十四·五，十二月十五日官方的指數是百分之一百七十一·四，現在可能是百分之一百六十九，比戰後最高記錄低落百分之三以上。</p>
<p>都市內家庭生活費用的减縮，主要是由於糧食零售價與衣着價格不斷的跌落。房租曾綏慢的上升，但燃料價格則形降低。</p>
<h3>香港在濃霧中　僑胞們冷靜地看大局　英國人自有宅的打算</h3>
<p>— 香港四日航訊　本報記者子鍵</p>
<p>一度在京滬綫上享有盛名的「冷氣飛快車」，最近也夾在南遷的洪流中，轉到廣九鐵路來，改名「特別直通快車」，在香港廣州之間穿梭行駛。如果拿今日的廣州比諸去年的南京，則香港很容易被人當作是渡週末好去處的「上海」了。</p>
<p>香港承南遷的餘緒，最近也來了不少人物，前兩天便有人以「在香港渡春節的政要」為題，在報上列出很長的名單來，他們在國內「搞」了多年，今天「如釋重荷」的靜坐下來，看看洋人怎樣「搞」這塊和中國分割不開的地方，倒是一個很難得的反省機會吧！</p>
<p>從香港回望國內，一般良善的僑胞祗目越加冷靜的沉默，他們暫時置身局外，旁觀者淸，把正反兩股力量看得明明白白，他們固不齒那些在這小島偷生而仍揮霍無度，生活糜爛的貪官污吏，但他們看見平日不是在洋商高等茶廳穿插往來，便在家裏搖筆桿罵人的「先生」，一轉身到了華北，便成了「民主要人」，也不禁啞然失笑！</p>
<p>從國內看香港，便覺眼花撩亂，實在難懂。有一個來港不久的客人說：「香港是籠罩在一層濃霧中。」春節的第三天上午，香港吹來了大霧，迷迷濛濛，其密度為數十年來所僅見，那個客人說，那正好作為今日香港的象徵</p>
<p>在這個都市裏，有人為了過不了年關而目殺，但在春節中，有人為了討好寵妓在酒樓上「大撒銀紙」。窮民的木屋火燒不盡，又遭拆除，富人賽過了馬，又開狗展覽會。儘管倫敦與香港之間密商執行一個新移民法，限制華人入口，但單是從飛機一路，去年來來去去的便有二二七·六八一人，除上述的新設直通快車外，民生公司由加拿大定製的新型鋁質客輪，也加入省港綫行走，往來香港九龍間的四艘小渡船，去年便收了一百六十萬元的凈利。港府最近公佈有趣味的統計數字中，香港市民每月所「拉」的糞，已超過了五萬噸！</p>
<p>儘管和平聲浪在中國以至國際間高唱入雲，香港却實行宣佈組織防衛軍，招募開始，立刻滿額，每個兵士每月可拿凈薪八十元。英國議負老遠從倫敦跑到香港來，第一句話就是：「英國議會各黨各派議員，都一致認為我們決心保衛香港。」香港中外名流發起組織一個「香港促進會」，播放「香港人不願把香港歸還中國」的民意。英國殖民部助理次官巴士堅在記者招待會說：「假如中國共黨份子是明白事理的話，他們也會覺得，維持香港的安定，對中國，對他們，都是有利的。」又說：英國必將盡力使香港不受當前遠東動亂的影響。</p>
<p>最近過港返英調任新職的前英駐華大使館陸軍武官菲爾然准將，說得較明顯，他說：「香港的未來，視乎共黨他們目己的決定，他們將不致愚昧到漠視一個如此繁榮的殖民地。假如在蘇俄控制下，我懷疑對外貿易會不會受影響，蘇俄和中國都不够滿足彼此的需要，尙有賴於外面世界的供給吧。」有此原因，香港的英商輪船公司很起勁的設法恢復香港與天津的航運，而香港與北韓的航運已早在進行中。</p>
<p>去年香港的商塲雖不算好景，據出入口署的統計，去年入口總值二，〇七七，五三八，六一五元，出口總值一，五八二，七三九，七一〇元，出入口總計較一九四七年度增加百分之三二·二三。據金融界方面消息稱：至去年年底為止，港幣發行額已達九億元，比一年前增加百分之廿，在粵省境內流通的約佔百分之廿五。香港已成今中國財富的最大集中點，港鈔的力量已足左右華南的經濟。</p>
<p>今日的香港，雖像籠罩在一層濃霧中，但從政治與經濟的角度看，也可隱約看出一個輪廓。姑勿論中國的局勢發生如何重大的變動，倫敦當局是不會輕易放棄這點「旣得利益」的。但英人能否利用這個「遠東民主櫥窗」，作為中英兩大民族永久友誼的基石，和太平洋和平的支柱，且待事實來證明吧。</p>

<h3>蘇聯向挪威政府建議　訂立互不侵犯條例　旨在阻挪參加大西洋聯盟</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦五日電〕莫斯科電台五日廣播：蘇聯已正式建議與挪威訂立互不侵犯條約，「俾消除任何關於蘇聯意向的懷疑」。廣播中稱，蘇駐挪大使亞芬納斯葉夫已將此項照會交輿挪政府。蘇聯此項照會，卽係答覆挪威關於其對北大西洋公約態度的聲明者。莫斯科電台稱，蘇照會中說明，西方聯盟國家希望將挪威拉入大西洋公約，俾在其境內建立軍事基地·照會中繼稱，「此對蘇聯最關重要，因為蘇挪兩國地城相鄰，具有共同防綫。」廣播中稱，蘇駐挪大使五日親晤挪外長蘭琪提出照會。並告知蘭氏：「挪威政府顯然洞悉蘇聯一向保持對挪友好態度，但如果挪政府仍懷疑蘇對挪的善鄰意向，蘇政府為消除任何關於蘇聯意向的懷疑計，願向挪政府建議與蘇訂立互不侵犯條約」。蘇照會中稱，挪政府宣佈在挪威未受攻擊或未遭受攻擊的威脅之時，不將允許任何國家使用其軍事基地，此點顯然並「不充分」。照會中繼稱，「上項聲明中顯示，在任何時間，包括目前承平時期在內，挪威卽可能藉謠言攻勢的手段，或出諸預謀的虛偽證明，以軍事基地供給外國使用。」蘇照會中並稱，蘇聯對挪政府認為北大西洋公約適合聯合國憲章中關於建立區域聯盟一節的觀點，不能同意。照會中稱，「顯然，大西洋聯盟的發動者正賴藉此項論據，但任何人均不能掩飾事實，在事實上大西洋聯盟係在聯合國範圍以外成立者，而為某些國家利用為侵略政策。」</p>

<p>渠稱，是否再「化費若干億，乃八十一屆國會之主要論爭點。」渠又稱，建議成立法國軍隊之費用為十億元，可知以後還需五十億，渠稱日本加諸美國納稅人的負担為十億，德國亦將繼續需用十億。渠稱軍事援助除直接供給現款與裝備外，還有間接的顧問與訓練。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科六日電〕眞理報今晨以「美國為何拒絕和平公約」為題，撰社論稱，美國領袖界反對和平公約表示侵略及國際冒險政策而已。眞理報在提及史達林最近對報界之聲明後，繼稱，無人能否認史達林此項計劃，能產生一種機會，不獨能解決美蘇關係，並且能加強整個世界和平及國際安全。蘇聯所以宣佈該國準備簽訂一項美蘇永久和平公約以及解決柏林問題，係出於蘇聯加強和平及國際安全之意志。但吾人現巳明悉，美國業已採取反對蘇聯所建議之各項措施。美國拒絕與蘇簽訂和平公約之意義無他，祇為此項公約之理想與堂際，實與美國領袖之國際政策一般路綫性質及原則相違反而已。美國此項政策之目的，係在產生由美國支持之侵略集團，推進軍備競賽，回復到過去之傳統反蘇政策，以及完成人所共知之孤立與包圍蘇聯戰略計劃。該社論繼稱，關於和平公約之理想，現在國際關係中盛行兩種絕對相反之觀念，一則目的在加強和平與國際安全，另一則目的在斷絕一切和平的國際合作，及繼績破壞美蘇間之關係。該報結論稱蘇聯為覓取永久民主和平起見，將堅決與一切戰爭販子作戰到底。</p>

<p>〔聯合社法蘭克福五日電〕戰後德國的「男人荒」愈形露骨，全國男女現為一對二之比。靑年女郎往往在公共廣告牌上大阻登其「徵求男友」的廣告。內容多半是：「某女士，芳齡廿二歲，金髮白膚碧眼，身材中等，願與富商交友，共消週末假日。」或為：「單身女子，年廿五歲，面貌秀麗，體格健全，願與卅歲以下男子交友，以遣良宵，自備公寓房間。」求愛廣告是一種新發明，但蔓延之勢，有如野火燎原，措詞赤裸，大部份都不提到結婚。</p>

<h3>昨晚籃球聯賽　綠隊娘子軍施威　聖約翰遭逢慘敗　洋兵內鬨海青擊敗培斐爾</h3>
<p>籃球聯賽昨晚三塲，女子組盟主綠隊二次出馬，以極大比數，大勝約翰大學女子隊，五十比二十一分，上半時綠隊以二十六比八佔極對優勢。甲二組郵電與警機對壘，警機以四十一比二十三得勝，上午時警機十九比五佔先。甲組兩洋兵隊內鬥，海靑勝培斐爾一分，四十三比四十二，甚為緊張，比賽結東，各得三十八分平手，延長五分鐘海靑獲得勝利，上半時廿五比十七，培斐爾佔優。昨晚體育館觀衆並不踴躍，比賽經過如下：</p>
<p>綠隊勝約翰</p>
<p>女子組首先開塲，綠隊對約翰，約翰吳漢蓮首告命中，先獲二分，綠隊明媛擲罰相繼，後來居上，約翰呼停，朱敏張羅羅衛鋒位置互易，然而無效，宗　曼麗雙中，七比二前導，張羅羅破籃，阿媛回敬，首節十一比五，綠隊佔先。第二節中綠隊前鋒益見猖獗，約翰僅賴吳漢運一擲，張羅羅，獲三分，前半綠隊以廿六比八遙領。再戰聲中，綠隊王維珍陸偉鈞入替曹曼麗伍美英並以朱錦芸調鋒，鬥力更弱，第三節卅九比十三比數成三與一之比。最後一節雙方陣綫均微有調整，約翰稍見振作，林靜怡先後得四球，綠隊明媛錦芸曼麗三將，則所獲償失有餘，總結五十比廿一，綠隊大破約翰，又造勝利。</p>
<p>警機勝郵電</p>
<p>繼之，甲二B組郵電與警機對壘，前者為梁溪冠軍隊，然昨晚打來鬆懈，且塲地籃圈皆生，所逢警機，畏力尤充沛，遂以廿三比四十一敗北。開　後，警機黃可根犯規，戴堯章兩罰中其一，為郵電開紀錄。　童繼又命中，警機扳成各三，警機以古振基代黃可根，未幾黃可根再入代張榮志，由是一路風順，張天祥黃可根殊為活躍，郵電雖頻頻易將，未能阻遏，上半時警機以十九比五遙佔先着。</p>
<p>休息再戰，郵電以李才膺下塲三元迅中，局勢驟見好轉，廿六比廿後，警機否極泰來，張天祥楊霞蓀又猛進攻，郵電氣阻，廿比卅七再度落後至終塲前四分鐘，戴堯章擲罰相繼，獲得三分，而警機天祥榮志跟手回敬兩球，時間已到，四十一比廿三警機奏捷。</p>

<h3>鐵路龍頭　比賽糾紛　兩路體育會　有聲明發表</h3>
<p>上週足球聯賽鐵路對龍頭一幕，當時因有觀衆「鬧塲」，幾乎造成不歡結果，足委會開會，以為鐵路隊中途離塲，後雖繼續比賽，有背運動員精神，決議重行比賽，球員亦分別處罰。兩路員工體育會對此次糾紛，昨有所聲明如下；</p>
<p>（一）起因在下半時的一隻十二碼球，說是本隊後衛在禁區內「絆倒」龍頭前鋒，其實這時皮球巳為本隊守門接住，且已踢出，事前龍頭前鋒，有意衝撞本隊守門，後衛以合法護衛，並無「撞」及「絆」，其時裁判遠在中綫，視察未淸，顯係誤會。</p>
<p>（一）旣被判十二碼球，乃有龍頭球員站在禁區界綫內，（與報載鐵路球員站在界棧內適相反）照規章應如何處理，裁判竟一無主見，詢之巡邊員，一主「重罰」一主作「界外球」論，在猶預不決之下，再判重罰，太隊球員以裁判一誤再誤，毫無主見，咸表不滿，徐岳二人走塲邊小休，觀衆以為本隊「罷踢」，糾紛遂起。</p>
<p>（三）當時本隊隊長正向裁判提口頭抗議，本隊球員亦未全部離塲，而觀衆誤會，鼓噪不休，比賽一度停頓，這責任不應由本隊來担負。</p>

<h3>無錫情殺案兇手　張際明可能處死</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫五日訊〕情殺案兇犯張際明，被稽查隊在滬逮捕解錫後，卽由軍法處漏夜審訊，惟張犯為圖卸罪責起見，供詞非常狡猾，處處飾詞掩護，甚至對證人之供詞，稍有破綻，還提出反問，經過數日來之疲勞審訊，張犯始俯首無話。昨日中午，巳由該隊押解城防指揮部法辦。</p>
<p>殺情婦</p>
<p>矢口否認</p>
<p>據張際明供稱：別號女昶，湖南醴陵人，年三十四歲。二十五歲時，在中央軍校十期步兵科畢業，歷任十九師排長，第四戰區司令部特務連長，一零七師少校營長，野戰重砲兵機槍連長，貴州軍管區司令部中校教官，交警總隊政工大隊長等職，對於槍殺悄婦坤伶張玉燕夫婦一案，矢口否認，並云對玉燕之身世，非常可憐，以前幫忙她，純係出於惻隱之心，毫無曖眛成份。嗣由承審軍法官王宇吾，飭傳東新旅社茶房徐阿榮，出事時同在房內之女孩張大黑，到塲指認無訛。屍父張玉亭，亦云：『張犯追求玉燕經過，第一次發生肉體關係，是在南京永安旅館」。怯官卽對張犯謂：『證據確擊，你再想一想，玉亭一家老小數口，生活所依賴之搖錢樹，完全給你送掉，你良心上說得過去嗎？』張犯聽後，始略有感動，稍停就說：「他們決不是我打死的，不過因我嫌疑最重，甘願一死了之。』</p>
<p>施狡猾</p>
<p>疲勞審結</p>
<p>軍法處以不得要領，就開始疲勞審訊，張犯還對法官說：『法律是很厲害的，我不能在供詞上自己找麻煩。』法官當反問：「你以為不承認這案子，法律就拿你無可奈何嗎？』張犯當時就笑而不答。據王軍法官發表之審訊經過，謂張際明雖然是一個軍人，但是巳染有濃厚的下流習氣，舉凡吃·着·嫖·賭。無一不搞，因此對於世故，老練之至，甚至還可能幹過審訊工作，所以他對於此案發生前後之供詞，沒有一處不運用自己的聰明和經騐，這決不是一個普通軍人的手段。最後軍怯官常用銳利目光，凝視着囚犯的面龐，使張犯為正氣所逼而低頭，情虛，以至言詞支吾，而不得不從實招供，承認了一切罪行。</p>
<p>處極刑</p>
<p>極有可能</p>
<p>最近一月來，本邑城廂內外，如東城腳，沙墳井，東新路，惠山等處，連續發生血案，城防部劉指揮官，特向京滬杭警備總司令部，電話請示處置打死柴主婦之某部士兵蕭詩暘，及本案張際明兩犯辦怯，湯總司令恩伯，當卽指示劉氏，應依照軍怯審判，授權就地處決，並對地方治安，極表關懷，謂如有擾亂公共秩序，及謠言惑衆者，均可就地逮捕槍決。據悉：劉指揮官已決遵令辦理，故蕭張二犯，短期內卽可判決，均有判處極刑可能。</p>

<h3>Unofficial Expressions from the CCP: Welcoming Shao and Zhang to Go North for Discussions; Beijing People's Delegation Arrives in Ping from Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Amidst the government's efforts to strive for peace, in addition to the Shanghai Peace Delegation's work to knock on the door of peace being about to commence, according to well-informed sources: the CCP has already made unofficial expressions regarding the government's peace representatives, welcoming Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong to go to Ping and discuss with them. Shao Lizi has not given positive confirmation regarding the above information, but he has also not denied it. As for how the CCP's opinion was expressed, relevant parties did not explicitly state. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, General Zhang Zhizhong, who returned to Lanzhou on official business a few days ago, will soon return to Nanjing from Lanzhou, but the exact date is still undetermined.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Mr. Huang Shaohong, who had just arrived in Beijing from Hankou on the 5th, continued to visit Acting President Li on the morning of the 6th, and then flew to Shanghai by plane at noon.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Gan Jiehou has completed the organization of the city's peace delegation after spending two days in Shanghai. Mr. Gan flew to Beijing again at 10:30 yesterday morning to pay respects to Acting President Li to request instructions on the date of departure, and to study the technical issues of conducting peace talks. It is expected that he will return to Shanghai with Shao Lizi within two days, and then depart immediately. The various peace representatives of the city are quietly awaiting Mr. Gan's return before determining the date of departure. There were no formal meetings held between them yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Gan Jiehou, who is busily traveling between Nanjing and Shanghai, flew back to Beijing from Shanghai by plane on the afternoon of the 6th. After getting off the plane, Mr. Gan drove to Acting President Li's residence to report, and visited Huang Shaohong, Huang Xuchu, Shao Lizi, and others to exchange opinions on peace issues.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] After Gan Jiehou arrived in Beijing on the 6th, he spent from noon until evening at Acting President Li's residence, discussing the relevant issues of the peace talks in detail. Around 10 p.m. on the evening of the 6th, he spoke with Shao Lizi on the phone, and arranged to meet on the 7th. Mr. Gan has scheduled to fly to Shanghai by plane on the morning of the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Shao Lizi went to the Jieshou Hall on the evening of the 6th at the invitation of friends to watch a play, and returned to his residence at 8 o'clock, feeling very happy in spirit.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 6th] The Beijing People's Peace Delegation took a China Aviation Corporation special plane No. 131 to Ping at 2 p.m. on the 6th. Although the six accompanying reporters have already traveled with them, the square still refused during a wireless telephone conversation on the morning of the 6th. Before the plane took off (10 a.m.), Qingdao and Ping first contacted each other by telephone, and the China Aviation Corporation radio station immediately opened up, reporting that the situation was good. The plane took 470 kilograms of mail from Qingdao.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Eleven Nanjing People's Peace Representatives flew from Qingdao on a China Aviation Corporation plane and arrived at the Xiyuan Airport here at 6 p.m. The plane was fired upon by anti-aircraft artillery before it contacted the ground during the trip, but there was no damage. Five journalists came along, including one woman. After landing, the pilot and journalists were not allowed to leave the airport. The representatives then drove to the Six Nations Hotel in the city to meet with lower-level CCP officials, and are scheduled to meet with Ye Jianying, Chairman of the Beiping Military Control Commission, on the morning of the 7th.</p>
<h3>Premier Sun's Remarks: The Government's Move South is Not a Relocation of the Capital; Continued Efforts Towards Peace; Firm Rejection of the Handover of War Criminals</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 6th] Premier of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke received reporters here on the afternoon of the 6th. He said that this was his first official reception of reporters since taking office as Premier of the Executive Yuan. He first described the process of forming the cabinet, stating briefly: At that time, it was decided to seek "glorious peace," and it was by no means a surrender cabinet. He has always advocated resolving domestic problems through peace, but should seek a reasonable solution, and must not discuss peace after being subdued by force. The government's move to Guangzhou this time is to avoid the threat of war. Because what the government seeks is peace, it must never make a treaty under duress. After President Chiang's retirement, the method of moving to Guangzhou was discussed with all parties and instructions were sought from Acting President Li. The final decision was made on January 25. At that time, Acting President Li and the heads of various Yuan and Ministries were present, and unanimously agreed. Therefore, this was actually decided under the instructions of Acting President Li, and was not the sole action of the Executive Yuan. The government is only relocating its office, and is not relocating the capital. After the Executive Yuan moves, the government will continue to work towards peace without being threatened by war. Tracing back to the announcement of President Chiang, the Executive Yuan immediately issued a statement in response, requesting both sides to first cease fire and then send representatives to discuss, so as to prevent the people from suffering the pain of war. However, the CCP actually considered this to be closing the door to peace, which is quite puzzling. Later, President Chiang announced his retirement, expressing his determination to seek peace, and immediately nominated five representatives to prepare for peace talks with the CCP. However, the CCP again stated: "It must wait until Beiping is completely liberated" before making a decision, but there has been no news to date. In the past week, Acting President Li also believed that waiting was not a solution, so he advocated that representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai first send representatives to knock on the door of peace. However, when they can depart is still unknown. However, the government is still not discouraged by this, because I have always opposed civil war, and this mission is to promote peace. He also said: After the victory, some people advocated resolving domestic problems through war, and I strongly opposed it. Now those who advocate war are feeling fearful, because if old scores are settled, it will take a long time to tell. At present, in order for the people to live and work in peace and contentment, and to live at an appropriate level, and at the same time to be friendly with both Eastern and Western allies, the government is relocating its office to work towards peace. At the end, he replied to reporters' inquiries: (1) A total of 18 cabinet members, 12 have arrived in Guangzhou, and a formal political affairs meeting will be held on the 7th. (2) The Presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans have arrived here, and there is no objection to the government's relocation. (3) Acting President Li has not ordered the various ministries and Yuans to move back to Nanjing. Before peace is realized, they should maintain close contact. (4) The government is acting as a whole after moving to Guangzhou. His opinions do not differ from those of Acting President Li. (5) Peace is not completely hopeless. (6) Acting President Li has expressed his intention to come to Guangzhou. (7) When he will return to Beijing is undecided. (8) Beijing and Shanghai can absolutely be defended. (9) Absolutely and strictly refuse to hand over war criminals. If peace cannot be realized, he will only negotiate with the CCP to the end.</p>
<h3>Weng Wenhao Decides to Return to Beijing to Assist in Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Tainan Dispatch, 6th] Weng Wenhao returned to Chiayi on the 6th after inspecting the oil refinery in Kaohsiung. He is scheduled to go to Taipei on the 7th. He has decided to go to Beijing to assist Acting President Li in peace talks. Mr. Weng met with reporters twice in the oil refinery and on the train, and was still earnestly inquiring about the printing of the Shen Bao map. He smiled and said that these things need to be completed under a stable situation, just like the oil refinery here.</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Will Fly to Taiwan Immediately; The Story of His Disappearance is Groundless</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Mo Dehui will fly to Taiwan within one or two days to discuss the matter of releasing Zhang Xueliang. The rumor that Mr. Mo is missing is inaccurate. According to his family's words to reporters: Mr. Mo is presiding over the distribution of relief funds for refugees of public education personnel in the Northeast in Shanghai, which is quite hard work. In recent days, due to high blood pressure, he followed the doctor's advice and moved to Zhongshan Hospital for recuperation. Yesterday morning, groups of refugees from the Northeast visited Mr. Mo at the hospital. After many conversations, he felt quite tired, so he left the hospital at noon to go to the residences of his friends Ding Guitang and Shi Bingchen for rest. In the afternoon, he went to the homes of other friends for a short stay. The story of his disappearance is groundless.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 5th] Mr. Mo Dehui from the Northeast, in order to provide relief to the refugees from the Northeast in Shaanxi, remitted 100,000 yuan in relief funds from Beijing at the beginning of the year, entrusting the Northeast Bureau Rural Association here to distribute them. The association has completed the registration, and the distribution will start on the 5th, with 120 yuan for a large household and 60 yuan for a small household, totaling 792 registered refugees.</p>
<h3>Mao Zedong is in Shijiazhuang; Zhang Dongsun Has Met with Him</h3>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Non-Communist political circles here expect that Beiping will become the site of the National People's Congress in the coming months to discuss China's new constitution and other matters. Preparatory work is currently underway in Shijiazhuang. Representatives of the Democratic League and Li Jishen have already arrived there. Professor Zhang Dongsun of Yenching University returned to Ping from Shijiazhuang on the 4th. He told friends that CCP Chairman Mao Zedong is also in Shijiazhuang and has met with him several times. Mr. Mao may come to Ping for a visit, but the date is undecided. The National People's Congress cannot be held before March at the earliest.</p>
<h3>Peace Conference of Seven Provinces and Cities Opened in Wuchang Yesterday; Representatives from Jiangxi, Anhui, and Henan Have Not Arrived Yet</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] The People's Peace Promotion Association of seven provinces and cities invited by people from Hubei Province opened in Wuchang at 2 p.m. on the 6th. More than 20 representatives from the people of Hunan, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hankou attended. First, Chiang Chi-yi, Speaker of the Guangxi Provincial Assembly, gave an opening speech, pointing out that the government has adopted peaceful measures, but the CCP has not made any concrete expressions for peace. In the future, the people should urge the CCP to accept the call for peace. Then representatives from various provinces and cities gave speeches. Wang Yuanyi and Mao Bingwen, representatives from Hunan, expressed dissatisfaction with the CCP's attitude and advocated that the people should give advice to the party that delays peace. Zhou Jie, Chen Shi, and others, representatives from Hubei, emphasized that the people should always maintain a third-party stance, be impartial and unbiased, and earnestly plead with both sides to cease fire. Because representatives from Jiangxi, Anhui, and Henan provinces are still on their way, no specific discussions were held at today's meeting. However, the majority of opinions were in favor of sending representatives to the CCP area to negotiate peace, and to recognize Mr. Li Xucheng, who has already gone to Ping to seek peace, as a legitimate representative. (Note: Mr. Li is going to the Communist area as the leader of the liaison group of the Hubei Provincial People's Peace Promotion Association.)</p>
<h3>Legislators Remaining in Shanghai Resolved to Resume Meeting in Nanjing in the Middle of the Month; Tong Guanxian and Yu Youren Fly to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] More than 130 legislators remaining in Shanghai held a discussion meeting starting at 3 p.m. yesterday, and elected Zou Shuwen as chairman. The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m. At yesterday's meeting, legislators Jiang Yiping, Chen Guyuan, Fang Zhichao, and others first reported on the preparatory process, followed by Chen Kewen, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, reporting on the recent situation of the Yuan in three points. Finally, the legislators had a heated discussion on the issues of resuming the third session and the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou. The legislators spoke enthusiastically, and some were emotional. In the end, four points were unanimously resolved: (1) In order to promote peace talks and stabilize people's hearts, the third session will be resumed in Nanjing. (2) The date of resumption will be set for February 15 of this year. (3) How to prepare transportation in Nanjing in case of emergency, please Secretary Chen of the Legislative Yuan handle. (4) The colleagues attending today will jointly send a telegram to President Tong, who has gone to Guangzhou, to notify him of today's decision, and ask him to invite his colleagues in Guangzhou to come to Beijing for the resumption of the meeting, and send separate telegrams to colleagues in various places to handle it in unison.</p>
<p>Also, the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Legislative Yuan has now decided to be temporarily located at the former Frontline Daily News Agency at No. 1 Harbin Road, Shanghai. The director is Wang Kexiang. It is heard that there are now more than 220 legislators remaining in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] President of the Legislative Yuan Tong Guanxian and President of the Control Yuan Yu Youren left Beijing on a Chasing Clouds special plane at 10 a.m. on the 6th and flew to Guangzhou. Shao Lizi, Zhang Yaoming, and many others went to the airport to see them off. The two Presidents Yu and Tong went to Guangzhou, in addition to visiting Premier Sun, and also had discussions with the legislative and supervisory members in Guangzhou. They will leave Guangzhou and return to Beijing in three days.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 6th] The two Presidents Yu and Tong arrived here at 3 p.m. on the 6th on Acting President Li's plane. Premier Sun personally accompanied them from the airport to Dongyuan for rest. Yu and Sun had a secret talk for one hour. Yu later told his friends that he came at the invitation of Premier Sun, and that he very much wanted to visit the old place he had been away from for more than ten years, and to solicit opinions on national affairs from people here. He denied that he came to urge Premier Sun to return to Beijing. He believes that the opinions of the Executive Yuan and the government should be consistent. Because he is a member of the central government, he came south once to avoid external instigation, but he must return to Beijing in three days, because the Supervisory Council is scheduled to be held in Beijing in the middle of this month. He immediately met with the wife of Supervisory Committee member Qing Shen'an, tears welling up in her eyes, and promised to do his best to handle Qing's funeral affairs.</p>
<p>Also, Xu Kan, Guan Jiyu, Duanmu Kai, Liu Weichi, Pang Songzhou, and others all flew here on the afternoon of the 6th.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Members Remaining in Shanghai Will Hold a Discussion Today</h3>
<p>[Our City Dispatch] The number of Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members coming to Shanghai is increasing day by day. They all believe that it is necessary to exchange opinions on the current situation. It is specially scheduled to hold a discussion meeting at 3 p.m. today at the auditorium on the fourth floor of the Shanghai City Bank on Jiujiang Road on the Bund. All Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members who have come to Shanghai from various places can go to participate even if they have not received a notice.</p>
<h3>President Chiang May Go to Xiamen; A Mansion on Gulangyu Has Been Repaired</h3>
<p>[United Press Xiamen Dispatch, 6th] It is rumored that President Chiang has arrived in Xiamen. This statement is definitely not true, but according to reports here, Mr. Chiang may come to Xiamen recently, because the Third Gendarmerie Regiment has been dispatched from Nanjing and is stationed on Gulangyu. The Lizi Society has also repaired and decorated a mansion at the foot of Tuoyan Mountain on the northern end of Gulangyu. The house is owned by a wealthy overseas Chinese and has not been inhabited for a long time since the Japanese occupied it. Xiamen is a transportation hub for the four provinces of Fujian, Taiwan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. Navigation and flight are very convenient. Gulangyu has always been considered the safest place in South China. Mr. Chiang had a good impression of it when he visited Gulangyu in 1922 and 1923.</p>
<h3>Li Yannian Arrives in Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Puzhen Dispatch, 6th] The Jiangbei front is completely silent. Li Yannian, commander of the army corps, left here for Beijing on the 6th, and went to Xiaolingwei to pay respects to Commander-in-Chief Enbo to report and request on defense matters.</p>
<p>[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 6th] The national army has completed a new deployment for the defense of southern Henan, and Zhang Gan's army corps, known as the bastion of central China, and Li Benyi's army commander have stationed in Xinyang, making people's hearts more at ease. After the siege of Guangshan and Luoshan was lifted, the national army has controlled the Xinyang-Huangchuan highway, and the important strongholds around Xinyang have restored the situation before the 27th of last month.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 5th] It is learned that there are no main forces of the Communist army within 300 li around Xinyang, and the situation in southern Henan is becoming more stable.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] It is rumored here again that the Zhengzhou and Kaifeng Communists have withdrawn north one after another, but officials have not yet confirmed this.</p>
<p>[Our Xinxiang Dispatch, 5th] The Communist army in northern Henan attacked the city walls of Huixian on the 1st with four regiments of troops and four siege guns. The team defending the city was weak, and after two days and nights of fierce fighting, the county town was invaded by the Communist army on the 4th. It is learned that the Communist army in northern Henan is frequently mobilizing, seemingly attempting to attack Xinxiang.</p>

(4) Xichang (including the Ning District) is extremely stable. The exchange of cotton yarn is popular.

Recently, many wild Yi have come to surrender. The chieftains hope that the government will pay money, and they will provide labor. It would be best to build a railway. (5) Regarding the Lei Mountain Risk Control Team, because the mountain is high and the weather has been bad recently, they have not yet set off.</p>

<h3>Beiping Removes Sandbags and Artillery Positions; Courts Taken Over by the Communist Army; Financial Markets Remain Chaotic</h3>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Beiping is removing sandbags, artillery positions, and other remnants of the 40-day siege, and is restoring normalcy.

<h3>Zhou Yide Urges the State Department to Approve the Revival of the Flying Tigers</h3>

State Department sources said that the State Department is very unlikely to change its policy of non-interference in the Chinese civil war and approve this action. Zhou said that the State Department's ruling could establish the Flying Tigers, and he believes that the State Department can make this decision. "Road Explorer" magazine said that the American volunteer base in this proposal has been established in Taiwan, and "the supply line for the Flying Tigers' application is available." It is reported that supporters of this plan are the Air Force Federation, which is composed of former members of the Fourteenth Air Force in China.

<h3>A Harmonious Atmosphere Envelops the Entire Xinjiang; Bao Erhan Says That Personnel from Ili Will Eventually Return to Dihua; Local Trade Between China and the Soviet Union Will Become More Active</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 6th] Xin province Chairman Bao Erhan met with reporters and spoke about the current situation in Xinjiang, saying that it is currently very stable and a harmonious atmosphere envelops the entire Xinjiang. The provincial administration has not yet made new developments because the unification and economic problems have not been fully resolved, but after the inauguration documents were sent to Ili, the general response was still good. Bao believes that the personnel from Ili will eventually return to Dihua. Also, because local products cannot be sold abroad and daily necessities are extremely scarce, the people's livelihood and economy are extremely depleted. The Sino-Soviet trade agreement that is about to be negotiated will be very beneficial to this. Both sides have agreed in principle on this trade agreement, and what remains to be discussed are technical issues. The local trade between China and the Soviet Union, which has been stagnant for four years, will become more active due to the signing of this agreement. Bao and others will return to their posts after paying respects to Director Zhang Zhizhong to report on their duties.</p>

<h3>Northwest Trends Have Been Finalized; Zhang Zhizhong Reiterates the Government's Sincere Efforts for Peace; Ma Hongkui Advocates Liberating Oneself</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 6th] The future trend of the Northwest has been concluded from the current affairs symposium convened by Zhang Zhizhong yesterday. After five hours of intense discussions among more than 150 legislative, supervisory committee members, national representatives, and local elders from the Northwest provinces remaining in Lanzhou, they almost unanimously sought stability, consolidation, and progress in the Northwest, so that the people of the Northwest would not suffer unnecessary sacrifices and could preserve the Northwest. At the meeting, Zhang Zhizhong reiterated the government's sincerity in seeking peace, and pointed out that judgments of success or failure cannot be made too early. The Northwest is an important part of China, and only the central government's policy should be followed. As for the future of the Northwest, it is closely related to the entire China and the world situation. The world situation is trending towards coordination, and China's peace is an urgent need for the whole people. We hope that the country will embark on a path of peace, democracy, prosperity, strength, and happiness, and we must not use the vast people as sacrifices in order to maintain the interests of one party, but rather take the interests of the entire country and people as the premise. The Northwest has special historical relations and a geographical environment. We must broaden our horizons and consider the Northwest's decisions from multiple perspectives. Protecting the Northwest is a matter for the vast people. The people rise up to support the government, and the stability and progress of the Northwest can be ensured. Ma Hongda said in his speech: The way of liberating the people touted by the Communist Party does not meet the needs of the people. Today, we should liberate ourselves and revolutionize ourselves. We must unite and work from the standpoint of the people, protect the Northwest with the power of the Northwest, and promote the progress of the country. We must ensure that the people of the Northwest do not hear the sound of gunfire, which is considered to achieve the purpose of preserving the Northwest. Wang Kaixu pointed out the anti-peace characteristics of the CCP, and demanded that wavering defeatists raise their vigilance, and emphasized that in the future, they should unite their strength with the awareness of surviving in a desperate situation, reform themselves consistently regardless of origin, religion, or ethnicity, and make all preparations to consolidate and stabilize the Northwest. Pei Jianzhun loudly called for preparing for war and seeking peace, not indulging in empty talk, and should focus on the word "preparation." The participants successively put forward concrete opinions such as developing self-defense forces and effectively strengthening military, political, economic, educational, and social measures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dihua Dispatch, 4th] Dihua Mayor Qu Wu flew back to Dihua from Lanzhou this afternoon.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Stabilizing the Lives of Public Educators!</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Transportation Restoration and various University Professors' Associations jointly held the first meeting of the Professors' Association on February 5th. During the meeting, they discussed the issue of improving professors' compensation and decided to send a telegram to Acting President Li, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education, explaining that current professors' monthly income is only equivalent to one and a half silver dollars, and prices are still rising. They requested that immediate measures be taken to improve the situation. Additionally, they requested the issuance of three months' worth of emergency funds and grain storage funds, both based on the price index at the time of disbursement. The aforementioned telegram will be sent out within days. It is a lament from the suffering professors and a cry from public educators nationwide under the pressure of high prices. In addition to sympathizing with this painful appeal, we hope to draw the close attention of the government authorities.</p>
<p>Since the three years of war, prices have soared, and the people's lives are in dire straits, especially for public educators. Public educators across the country are living in hardship, with many tragic and moving stories. Almost every day, they struggle to breathe, hoping that the country will soon achieve peace and that the people's livelihoods will be restored. In these three years, the government seems to have shown some concern for public educators, but the soaring prices have quickly nullified any compensation adjustments made by the government. Currently, public educators' salaries are paid in Gold Yuan notes, calculated based on the "August 19th" base and doubled, with fifteen times the base for areas like Beijing and Shanghai. At the end of last year, due to the turbulent situation, there was a one-month salary increase, but it was merely a drop in the bucket. For months, public educators have remained in a life of hardship, with those in the Beijing-Shanghai area experiencing the most severe poverty.</p>
<p>University professors occupy a superior position in academia and technology. Their lives and cultivation are immersed in a spiritual environment, adhering to the fundamental values of education, fulfilling their responsibilities to the nation and their duties to education. They should not be troubled by material life, nor should they be driven by the burden of clothing, food, and children, leading to the loss of a normal life attitude and affecting their scholarship and research. If their life attitude is influenced and frustrated by objective factors, it is a loss for the country and a misfortune for education! However, the most serious fact today is that it is driving educators, like the majority of middle and lower-level civil servants, towards poverty and suffering. Zhu Kezhen, President of Zhejiang University, told our Hangzhou reporter on January 8th, "The school's finances have been in very poor condition recently, and we can't even afford to light a fire." The entire faculty and students are studying hard in the cold wind. He also said, "The average salary of a professor is only 700 Gold Yuan notes, which can only buy one dan of rice. If a professor has a wife and two children, how can they survive? And prices are likely to rise even further!" Furthermore, 278 professors at Fudan University sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education on January 14th, requesting improved compensation, saying, "Since the government's financial and price policies have changed repeatedly, Shanghai prices have soared more than 40 times in the past four months, while the salaries of our colleagues are only five times the salary amount at the time of the Taiwan dollar system reform. This meager amount is truly difficult to sustain life. Currently, our colleagues have pawned almost everything and have no way to borrow money, so we are making an urgent appeal." However, this painful appeal has not yielded any results or responses. The Minister of Education, Youth Affairs, and all of the other officials went to Guangzhou, and while the Deputy Minister remained in Shanghai, he was at a loss. When professor representatives went to see him, his answers were completely irrelevant. Such matters closely related to education are beyond the imagination of the principal officials. Today's prices have risen to 250 to 300 times the original level, and the impoverished state of ordinary public educators is even more imaginable. Can government officials still turn a blind eye?</p>
<p>Currently, the vast majority of educators across the country are struggling hard under the dual pressure of the aforementioned material and spiritual burdens. Their greatness and responsibility are truly moving and cannot be described by a mere journalist's pen. We deeply sympathize with the current plight of educators. However, it is not enough to rely solely on our literary sympathy. Therefore, we would like to remind the government authorities to take immediate action to adjust the compensation of public educators in order to rescue the education crisis, stabilize the lives of public educators, and even to nurture and employ talent. The appeal of the Professors' Association of Jiaotong University and Fudan University is a spark of hope burning when, as Mr. Chen Bulei said, "the oil is exhausted and the lamp is dying." The authorities should not extinguish this hope. On the contrary, they should cultivate this hope reasonably in order to achieve the goal of cultivating education and culture.</p>

<h3>The Price Level in the United States Generally Starts to Fall</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington 1st Dispatch] After rising continuously for ten years, the prices of world commodities are now beginning their downward trend. The prices of many basic commodities have fallen considerably, and the downward trend is gradually spreading to other commodities. The Dow Jones Futures Commodity Index published by the Wall Street Journal has indicated that world buyers believe that this downward trend will continue. This index reflects buyers' estimates of the prices of eleven important commodities in the next five months, based on future commercial transactions in the US commodity market. The recently published index is at the lowest level since mid-1947, more than 22 percent lower than the highest index in 1947.</p>
<p>Ordinary civilians in the United States who purchase retail goods are just beginning to notice changes in prices. Food prices seem to be decreasing, and the prices of men's and women's clothing, furniture, household appliances, furs, and other items have also decreased significantly during major sales. The prices of used cars have fallen sharply, but on the whole, the retail prices of used cars have not fallen much compared to the past, and the prices of new cars are somewhat higher. Building materials are also not much cheaper.</p>
<p>The most significant drop has been in the prices of raw materials. Raw material prices will eventually be reflected in the prices of goods purchased by consumers, and among raw materials, the prices of the so-called 28 "sensitive" basic commodities show the most dramatic decline. In these 28 commodities, changes in supply and demand are the fastest and most free.</p>
<p>The government-compiled index of this type of item was 283.07 on January 31 (August 1939 was 100), which is about 20 percent lower than the post-war high. The prices of several items are lower than the price level when the United States price controls were lifted on June 28, 1946.</p>
<p>The prices of rubber and silk in these 28 commodities are much lower than the price levels during past price controls. This is partly due to the competition from synthetic rubber and rayon for both rubber and silk. The prices of corn, barley, and beef and sheep fat are slightly lower than the controlled prices in June 1946, while the price of lard is slightly higher.</p>
<p>The prices of lard, beef and sheep fat, and silk have fallen the most sharply, 60 to 70 percent lower than the post-war peak. The prices of cottonseed oil, corn, barley, cocoa beans, and printed cloth are 40 to 60 percent lower. The prices of wheat, pigs, calves, butter, rubber, hemp, linen, resin, and hides are 23 to 33 percent lower.</p>
<p>The price trends have not significantly affected the prices of major metals, but the prices of scrap steel and scrap copper have fallen, and the black market (insurance prices) for steel and other products has begun to disappear.</p>
<p>The downward trend in raw material prices has begun to be reflected in wholesale and consumer retail prices. The government's weekly compiled wholesale price level for 900 different commodities fell to 158.8 percent of the 1926 average last week, which is the lowest level since the beginning of November 1947, and 6.5 percent lower than the post-war peak in August of the previous year.</p>
<p>The retail prices that families with moderate incomes in major cities have to pay have gradually decreased since April. The highest peak was created last September, when the government's monthly consumer price index reached 174.5 percent of the 1935 to 40 average. The official index on December 15 was 171.4 percent, and it is now probably 169 percent, more than 3 percent lower than the post-war high.</p>
<p>The reduction in household living expenses in urban areas is mainly due to the continuous decline in retail food prices and clothing prices. Rents have risen slowly, but fuel prices have decreased.</p>
<h3>In Hong Kong, Amidst Dense Fog, Compatriots Calmly Observe the Overall Situation; The British Have Their Own Plans</h3>
<p>—Hong Kong 4th Air Mail Dispatch, Our Newspaper Reporter Zi Jian</p>
<p>The "Air-Conditioned Express Train," which once enjoyed a high reputation on the Beijing-Shanghai line, has recently been caught up in the southward migration and transferred to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, renamed the "Special Direct Express Train," shuttling between Hong Kong and Guangzhou. If Guangzhou today is compared to Nanjing last year, then Hong Kong can easily be regarded as "Shanghai," a good place to spend the weekend.</p>
<p>Following the trend of southward migration, Hong Kong has recently seen an influx of people. A few days ago, someone published a long list in the newspaper with the title "Political Figures Spending the Spring Festival in Hong Kong." After "engaging" in activities in the mainland for many years, they are now "relieved of their burden" and sitting down quietly to see how foreigners "engage" in this place that cannot be separated from China, which is indeed a rare opportunity for reflection!</p>
<p>Looking back at the mainland from Hong Kong, most well-meaning compatriots are increasingly silent. They are temporarily outside the situation, and as observers, they clearly see the positive and negative forces. They certainly despise those corrupt officials who live extravagantly and dissolutely on this small island, but they also cannot help but smile when they see the "gentlemen" who usually frequent foreign high-class tea houses or write articles at home to scold people, but who, once they arrive in North China, become "democratic figures"!</p>
<p>Looking at Hong Kong from the mainland, one feels dizzy and confused. A guest who had recently arrived in Hong Kong said, "Hong Kong is shrouded in a dense fog." On the morning of the third day of the Spring Festival, a thick fog blew into Hong Kong, its density being the greatest in decades. The guest said that it was a good symbol of Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>In this city, some people commit suicide because they cannot get through the New Year, but during the Spring Festival, some people "scatter silver paper" in restaurants to please their mistresses. The wooden houses of the poor are burned down and then demolished, while the rich hold horse races and dog shows. Although London and Hong Kong are secretly discussing the implementation of a new immigration law to restrict the entry of Chinese people, 227,681 people went back and forth by plane alone last year. In addition to the newly established direct express train mentioned above, new aluminum passenger ships custom-made by the Minsheng Company from Canada have also joined the Guangzhou-Hong Kong line. The four small ferries that travel between Hong Kong and Kowloon received a net profit of 1.6 million yuan last year. In a recent interesting statistical figure released by the Hong Kong government, the amount of feces "pulled" by Hong Kong citizens each month has exceeded 50,000 tons!</p>
<p>Although the voice of peace is sung loudly in China and even internationally, Hong Kong has actually announced the organization of a defense force. Recruitment began and was immediately full. Each soldier can receive a net salary of 80 yuan per month. British members of Parliament traveled a long way from London to Hong Kong. The first thing they said was: "Members of all parties in the British Parliament unanimously believe that we are determined to defend Hong Kong." Celebrities from China and abroad in Hong Kong launched an "Hong Kong Promotion Association" to broadcast the public opinion that "Hong Kong people do not want to return Hong Kong to China." Basil, the Assistant Under-Secretary of the British Colonial Office, said at a press conference: "If the Chinese Communists are sensible, they will also feel that maintaining the stability of Hong Kong is beneficial to China and to them." He also said: Britain will do its best to protect Hong Kong from the current turmoil in the Far East.</p>
<p>Brigadier General Philran, the former British Military Attaché to the Chinese Embassy who had been transferred from Hong Kong to London to take up a new position, put it more clearly. He said, "The future of Hong Kong depends on the Communists' own decisions. They will not be so foolish as to ignore such a prosperous colony. If it is under Soviet control, I doubt whether foreign trade will be affected. The Soviet Union and China are not enough to satisfy each other's needs and still rely on supplies from the outside world." For this reason, British shipping companies in Hong Kong are actively trying to restore shipping between Hong Kong and Tianjin, and shipping between Hong Kong and North Korea has already been underway for some time.</p>
<p>Although the Hong Kong market was not doing well last year, according to the statistics of the Import and Export Department, the total value of imports last year was 2,077,538,615 yuan, and the total value of exports was 1,582,739,710 yuan. The total value of imports and exports increased by 32.23% compared to 1947. According to financial sources, by the end of last year, the amount of Hong Kong dollars issued had reached 900 million yuan, an increase of 20% compared to a year ago, and about 25% of it was circulating within Guangdong Province. Hong Kong has become the largest concentration point of Chinese wealth today, and the power of Hong Kong currency is enough to influence the economy of South China.</p>
<p>Although Hong Kong today seems to be shrouded in a dense fog, a general outline can be vaguely seen from a political and economic perspective. Regardless of how significant changes occur in the situation in China, the London authorities will not easily give up this "vested interest." But whether the British can use this "Far East democratic showcase" as the cornerstone of the permanent friendship between the two great nations of China and Britain, and the pillar of peace in the Pacific, remains to be proven by facts.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Suggests to the Norwegian Government Establishing a Non-Aggression Treaty Aimed at Preventing Norway from Joining the Atlantic Alliance</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 5th] Moscow Radio broadcast on the 5th: The Soviet Union has formally suggested to Norway the establishment of a non-aggression treaty "to eliminate any doubts about Soviet intentions." The broadcast stated that the Soviet ambassador to Norway, Afanasiev, has submitted this note to the Norwegian government. This Soviet note is in response to Norway's statement regarding its attitude towards the North Atlantic Treaty. Moscow Radio stated that the Soviet note explained that Western alliance countries hope to pull Norway into the Atlantic Treaty to establish military bases on its territory. The note continued, "This is of utmost importance to the Soviet Union because the two countries, the Soviet Union and Norway, are geographically adjacent and share a common defense line." The broadcast stated that the Soviet ambassador to Norway met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange on the 5th to present the note. He also informed Lange: "The Norwegian government clearly understands that the Soviet Union has always maintained a friendly attitude towards Norway, but if the Norwegian government still doubts the Soviet Union's good neighborly intentions towards Norway, the Soviet government, in order to eliminate any doubts about Soviet intentions, is willing to suggest to the Norwegian government the establishment of a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union." The Soviet note stated that the Norwegian government's declaration that it would not allow any country to use its military bases unless Norway is attacked or threatened with attack is clearly "insufficient." The note continued, "The above statement shows that at any time, including the current peaceful period, Norway may use rumors or premeditated false evidence to supply foreign countries with military bases." The Soviet note also stated that the Soviet Union cannot agree with the Norwegian government's view that the North Atlantic Treaty conforms to the section on establishing regional alliances in the United Nations Charter. The note stated, "Obviously, the initiators of the Atlantic Alliance are relying on this argument, but no one can conceal the fact that the Atlantic Alliance is in fact established outside the scope of the United Nations and is being used by certain countries for aggressive policies."</p>
<h3>Military Analyst Huie Claims The US is Equipping New Armies in Japan and Germany Training Could Be Completed Before the End of the Year</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 5th] A military analyst claimed on the 5th that the Japanese and German armies under British and American control could be established by the end of this year. In an article in the February issue of a business magazine, Huie stated that a new Japanese army under American control will emerge before the end of 1949. Huie also stated that the revival of a German army under British and American control is "highly possible." Huie's report stated that US military aid has equipped thirty "non-demobilized armies on earth" through "various means." Millions of dollars have been used to train and equip these armies.</p>
<p>He said that whether to spend "several hundred million more is the main point of contention in the 81st Congress." He also said that the proposed cost of establishing a French army is one billion dollars, which means that another five billion will be needed later. He said that Japan's burden on American taxpayers is one billion, and Germany will also continue to need one billion. He said that military aid includes not only direct supply of cash and equipment, but also indirect consultants and training.</p>
<h3>Royal Flies Back to Tokyo Today Flies to Korea</h3>
<p>Claims to Know Nothing About Huie's Comments</p>
<p>[United Press Kyoto, 6th] US Secretary of the Army Royal told United Press here on the 6th that he had no knowledge of the plan predicted by military analyst Huie in an article in the February issue of the National Business Magazine that Japanese and German armies would be re-established under the control of the United States and Britain.

<p>[United Press Washington, 5th] Retired Lieutenant General Acheson said on the 5th that after the change in the Far East strategic situation, Japan is "more vulnerable, but also more valuable" to the United States.</p>
<h3>Iranian Left-Wing Tudeh Party Declared Illegal</h3>
<p>Assassin of the Iranian King Dies from Severe Wounds</p>
<p>[United Press Tehran, 5th] After the assassination attempt on the King of Iran, public sentiment was outraged, and the left-wing Tudeh Party clubs in Tehran were destroyed by the public. The Iranian government announced on the 5th that the party was an illegal organization. Fourteen important leaders of the Tudeh Party have been arrested, and others are still being arrested. According to palace sources, King Pahlavi's health has shown significant progress. The announcement accused the Tudeh Party of spreading "revolutionary communist theories among students." The assassin of the Iranian King, Khakileh, was a member of the Tudeh Party and died after being beaten upon arrest.</p>
<h3>Two Soviet Divisions Arrive in Germany Berlin Cold War Intensifies</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 6th] The tension of the Berlin Cold War reached a new climax last night. Soviet-approved newspapers hinted that if the United States and Britain intensify the counter-blockade, the Soviet Union will take retaliatory measures. German workers and police have dug trenches at key road junctions to support the order prohibiting West German cars from entering East Germany. Currently, the only connection between Berlin and West Germany is by telegram, apart from air transport. It is also learned that two more Soviet divisions have arrived in Germany, bringing the total number of troops to 230,000.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 5th] The Soviet Union announced that shooting exercises in the sky corridor will begin today and last for five hours. The West has lodged a verbal protest with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>US Rejects Soviet Peace Proposal Pravda Criticizes</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Moscow, 6th] Pravda published an editorial this morning entitled "Why Does the United States Reject a Peace Treaty," stating that the US leadership's opposition to a peace treaty represents a policy of aggression and international adventurism. Pravda, after mentioning Stalin's recent statement to the press, continued, "No one can deny that Stalin's plan can create an opportunity not only to resolve US-Soviet relations, but also to strengthen world peace and international security." The Soviet Union's declaration that it is ready to sign a permanent peace treaty between the US and the Soviet Union and to resolve the Berlin issue stems from the Soviet Union's will to strengthen peace and international security. But we now know that the United States has taken measures to oppose all of the Soviet Union's proposed measures. The significance of the United States' refusal to sign a peace treaty with the Soviet Union is nothing more than the fact that the ideals and intentions of this treaty are fundamentally contrary to the general line, nature, and principles of the international policies of the US leadership. The purpose of this policy of the United States is to create aggressive blocs supported by the United States, promote an arms race, revert to the traditional anti-Soviet policy of the past, and complete the well-known strategic plan of isolating and encircling the Soviet Union. The editorial continued that there are now two absolutely contradictory concepts prevalent in international relations regarding the ideals of a peace treaty, one aimed at strengthening peace and international security, and the other aimed at severing all peaceful international cooperation and continuing to undermine relations between the US and the Soviet Union. The newspaper concluded that the Soviet Union will resolutely fight to the end against all warmongers in order to seek permanent democratic peace.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Athens, 5th] Greek Security Minister Rendis said today in a military meeting presided over by King Paul, "Any change in government in totalitarian countries implies a serious internal crisis, and those who are dismissed will disappear from the political stage forever." The overthrow of the Marcos government is a brilliant achievement of the Truman Doctrine.

<h3>The Endowment of War Excessive Number of Women Grotesque Marriage Advertisements</h3>
<p>[United Press Frankfurt, 5th] The "man shortage" in post-war Germany is becoming increasingly apparent. The national ratio of men to women is now one to two. Young women often boldly post "Seeking Boyfriend" advertisements on public billboards. The content is mostly: "Ms. So-and-so, 22 years old, blonde hair, fair skin, blue eyes, medium build, willing to make friends with wealthy businessmen and spend weekends together." Or: "Single woman, 25 years old, beautiful face, healthy physique, willing to make friends with men under 30 to pass the night, apartment room provided." Love advertisements are a new invention, but the spread is like wildfire, and the wording is naked, most of which do not mention marriage.</p>

<h3>Du Yuesheng and Xu Jiqing Talk Encourage Industry and Commerce Not to Drift With the Tide Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Industrial Association, and Xu Jiqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement yesterday, urging industry and commerce to increase production and stabilize prices. It roughly stated: Since the opening of the market after the Spring Festival, due to the influx of hot money, various prices have risen accordingly, and the speed and height of the rise have been unexpected. The rise in daily necessities is particularly severe, which seriously threatens the lives of civilians. Currently, the authorities are actively planning to channel hot money, and the sale of yarn has also been implemented. If the currency can have a considerable destination, prices will naturally stabilize. Our colleagues in industry and commerce are responsible for increasing production and trading in goods, and we hope that each will do their best in their respective positions, striving to increase manufacturing on the one hand and supply demand on the other, so that materials are abundant and prices are stable. The costing and pricing should be based on the standard of being sufficient for re-production and replacement. Do not drift with the tide and pursue excessive profits. Stabilizing the market is also stabilizing people's hearts.</p>

Since then, prices have fluctuated sharply. Recently, coal prices have been adjusted daily, and oil prices have also been adjusted every other day. Compared with January 26, on February 5, the price of coal per ton increased from 4,896 yuan to 13,452 yuan, and the price of fuel oil per ton increased from 8,948 yuan to 28,350 yuan, both increasing by more than two times.

The total cost of navigation has increased by 170%. And prices are still fluctuating daily and rising crazily, changing from morning to evening, so it is impossible to calculate costs. The shipping industry hopes that the government will flatten prices within a few days so that cost calculation can be prepared. Therefore, it was specially resolved not to adjust freight rates for the time being.</p>

Upon hearing this news, the industry association convened a general meeting of all members yesterday to discuss this issue. The association believes that the average increase in the cost of essential items for the industry, such as public utilities, rice, oil, cloth, laundry, and newsprint, has already increased by more than 340 times compared to "August 19th." If calculated at 190 times, it will not be possible to maintain costs, and if fees are charged according to the cost of living index, it will be even more impossible to sustain. Therefore, it has been decided to send representatives to the city government this morning to petition, stating the difficulties of the industry and requesting that the city government continue to follow the previously approved method, with the council assessing the prices, or allow the association to negotiate prices based on costs. If they still align with the cost of living index, they hope that the costs paid by the hotels will also be paid according to the cost of living index multiplier to maintain the survival of the hotel industry and the livelihoods of thousands of employees.</p>
<h3>Metropole Ballroom Smashed and People Injured; Six Perpetrators Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 7 p.m. last night, as the tea dance was about to end at the Metropole Ballroom on Tibet Road, suddenly over 40 thugs arrived and, without asking why, smashed all the tables, chairs, glasses, etc. in the ballroom and injured three waiters. Upon seeing this, the person in charge of the ballroom immediately called the Huangpu Police Sub-Bureau, which dispatched a "Flying Fortress" to suppress the situation. Six people were arrested on the spot. The rest escaped. The arrested individuals identified themselves as Wu A-kui, Lei Guang-yu, He Zhen-fang, Li Ren-jie, Zhang Miao-gen, and Dai De-xuan, but all refused to reveal the names of those who instructed them. Only a business card of Zheng Xiong was found on each of them. The police are still continuing their investigation.</p>
<h3>Trial of Ten Defendants in the Victory Ballroom Smashed Case to Be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The trial of ten defendants, including Zhang De-run, who are accused of smashing the Victory Ballroom, will be held at 8 a.m. tomorrow morning by Presiding Judge Zhong Xian-da of the District Court, after the District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution. The case stems from an incident on the evening of January 10th of this year, when the defendants invited several friends to dance at the Victory Ballroom and invited three familiar dancers to sit with them. After the dance, Zhang and the others refused to pay the tea fee because the dancers they invited were all acquaintances, which led to an argument with the tea waiter on duty. Feeling resentful, Zhang invited over sixty people the next day and went to the ballroom to cause trouble, beating tea waiters Chen Xin-rong and Wang Ding-fa, among others, and damaging glass panels, teacups, and other items. After the ballroom manager, Chen Ji-mei, reported the incident to the police, the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. Chen also filed an incidental civil suit, requesting that the defendants be ordered to compensate for the damages.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Basketball League: Green Team's Women Show Strength; St. John's Suffers a Crushing Defeat; Foreign Players' Infighting; Haiqing Defeats Peifeier</h3>
<p>There were three basketball league games last night. In the women's division, the champion Green Team played twice, defeating the St. John's University women's team by a large margin, 50 to 21.

The audience at the gymnasium last night was not large. The results of the games are as follows:</p>
<p>Green Team Wins Against St. John's</p>
<p>The women's division opened the game with Green Team versus St. John's. St. John's Wu Han-lian scored first, earning two points. Green Team's Ming Yuan scored on free throws, coming from behind. St. John's called a timeout. Zhu Min and Zhang Luo-luo switched positions, but it was ineffective. Zong and Man-li both scored, leading 7 to 2. Zhang Luo-luo broke through the basket. Ah Yuan responded. The first quarter ended with Green Team leading 11 to 5. In the second quarter, the Green Team's forwards became more rampant. St. John's relied only on Wu Han-yun's shot. Zhang Luo-luo scored three points. In the first half, the Green Team led by a large margin, 26 to 8. In the second half, the Green Team replaced Cao Man-li and Wu Mei-ying with Wang Wei-zhen and Lu Wei-jun, and adjusted Zhu Jin-yun to forward, weakening their fighting power. The third quarter ended with the score 39 to 13, a ratio of three to one. In the final quarter, both sides made slight adjustments to their lineups. St. John's showed some improvement. Lin Jing-yi scored four goals. The Green Team's Ming Yuan, Jin Yun, and Man Li scored even more. Overall, the Green Team defeated St. John's by a large margin, 50 to 21, creating another victory.</p>
<p>Police Machinery Wins Against Postal and Telecommunications</p>
<p>Next was the Group B second-division match between the Postal and Telecommunications Team and the Police Machinery Team. The former was the champion of Liangxi, but they played loosely last night, and the baskets on the court were not in good condition. The Police Machinery Team, whom they faced, had plenty of power, so they lost 23 to 41. After the opening, Police Machinery's Huang Ke-gen committed a foul. Dai Yao-zhang made one of two free throws, opening the scoring for the Postal and Telecommunications Team. Tong Ji also scored. The Police Machinery Team tied the score at 3 each. The Police Machinery Team replaced Huang Ke-gen with Gu Zhen-ji. Soon after, Huang Ke-gen re-entered, replacing Zhang Rong-zhi. From then on, everything went smoothly. Zhang Tian-xiang and Huang Ke-gen were particularly active. Although the Postal and Telecommunications Team frequently changed players, they could not stop them. The Police Machinery Team led by a large margin in the first half, 19 to 5.</p>
<p>After the break, Postal and Telecommunications Team's Li Cai-ying quickly scored three goals, and the situation suddenly improved. After 26 to 20, the Police Machinery Team turned the corner. Zhang Tian-xiang and Yang Xia-sun attacked fiercely again. The Postal and Telecommunications Team's momentum stalled. They fell behind again, 20 to 37. In the last four minutes before the end, Dai Yao-zhang scored on free throws, earning three points. The Police Machinery Team's Tian-xiang and Rong-zhi immediately responded with two goals. Time ran out. The Police Machinery Team won 41 to 23.</p>

<h3>Railway Football Team Competition Dispute: Two-Road Sports Association Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Regarding the scene of the Railway versus Longtou football league game last week, which almost resulted in an unpleasant outcome due to spectators "making a scene," the Football Committee held a meeting and believed that the Railway team left the field halfway, and although they continued the game later, it was against the spirit of sportsmanship. It was decided to replay the game, and the players were also punished separately. The Two-Road Employees' Sports Association issued the following statement yesterday regarding this dispute:</p>
<p>(1) The cause was a penalty kick in the second half, which was said to be because the team's defender "tripped" the Longtou forward in the penalty area. In fact, the ball had already been caught and kicked out by the team's goalkeeper. The Longtou forward intentionally collided with the team's goalkeeper beforehand. The defender legally defended and did not "hit" or "trip." At that time, the referee was far in the middle line and did not see clearly, which was obviously a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>(2) Since a penalty kick was awarded, a Longtou player was standing inside the penalty area line (contrary to the newspaper report that Railway players were standing inside the line). According to the rules, how should it be handled? The referee had no opinion at all. When asked the linesman, one advocated "severe penalty" and the other advocated "out of bounds." While hesitating and indecisive, another penalty was awarded. The team's players were dissatisfied with the referee's repeated mistakes and lack of opinion. Xu and Yue took a break by the side of the field. The audience thought that the team was "striking," and the dispute arose.</p>
<p>(3) At that time, the team captain was making an oral protest to the referee, and the team's players did not all leave the field. The audience misunderstood and made a lot of noise. The game was interrupted once. This responsibility should not be borne by the team.</p>
<h3>Group C Football Finals: Public Transport and Firefly Win</h3>
<p>The two matches of the Group C Football League finals were also held at Yiyuan Stadium, starting at 9 a.m. After competing, Public Transport defeated Yong'an by a score of 6 to 0. Subsequently, Firefly faced Jizhi. The strength of the two teams was about the same, and they fought fiercely. At the end of the game, the score was tied at 1 to 1, and no winner was determined. According to regulations, overtime was extended by 20 minutes. Firefly relied on their final efforts and scored another goal, winning 2 to 1. Public Transport and Firefly both won the finals.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Starts Strong but Fades; Jingwu Turns Defeat into Victory; Yiyuan Football Match Result: 4 to 3</h3>
<p>In the Group A football match, Jingwu and China National Aviation Corporation met at Yiyuan Stadium. The weather was extremely cold, and there were few spectators. Both sides lacked excitement. China National Aviation Corporation started strong but faded. They won three goals in the first half. Jingwu showed great promise in the second half. Wu Jing-ren pulled off a hat trick, scoring four goals alone, turning defeat into victory.</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation took the offensive first. Li Shun-sheng pressed hard and shot into the chaos, scoring the first goal. Not long after, Zheng Si-min passed to the front of the goal. Li Shun-sheng hit the upper right corner. Gao Zhi-wen watched helplessly, making it 2 to 0. After that, the stalemate continued until the 28th minute. Xu Zu-guo took the ball deep and approached the goal, gently flicking it. Gao Zhi-wen turned over and tried to save it, but it rolled into the net. The first half ended with China National Aviation Corporation winning three goals.</p>
<p>After the break, Jingwu's offense was strong. As soon as the battle resumed, Fang Ren-qiu cut in and knocked on the door. Wang Guo-guang failed to save. Wu Jing-ren flew up and shoveled it in, pulling back a city. Not long after, Fang Ren-qiu passed again, Wu Jing-ren tapped his strength and shot, bouncing off Wang Guo-guang's body and into the goal, cutting another pass. After 16 minutes, Liang Min-tao passed, and Wu Jing-ren shot, breaking through another city, tying the game. China National Aviation Corporation saw that the situation was not good and used veteran Fu Zhi-bin, replacing Zheng Si-min. Gao Xiu-qing carelessly twisted her ankle and staggered. Not long after, Xu Zu-guo was also injured and left the field. Jingwu's Wu Jing-ren received support, broke through and knocked on the door, taking another city. With four goals to three, Jingwu turned defeat into victory.</p>

<h3>Beijing East Road Fire: Northwest Company Office Careless; All Twelve Employees Fortunately Escape</h3>

<h3>Wuxi Love Suicide Case: Murderer Zhang Ji-ming May Be Executed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Wuxi on the 5th] After being arrested by the Investigation Team in Shanghai and escorted back to Wuxi, the love suicide case murderer Zhang Ji-ming was interrogated overnight by the Military Law Office. However, in order to shirk his responsibility, Zhang's confession was very cunning, covering up his words everywhere. He even raised counter-questions to the witnesses' confessions when there were slight flaws. After several days of exhausting interrogation, Zhang finally bowed his head and said nothing. Yesterday at noon, he was escorted by the team to the City Defense Headquarters for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Killed Mistress</p>
<p>Denies Vehemently</p>
<p>According to Zhang Ji-ming's confession: also known as Nv-chang, from Liling, Hunan, 34 years old. Graduated from the 10th Infantry Class of the Central Military Academy at the age of 25. He served as platoon leader of the 19th Division, company commander of the Special Service Company of the Fourth War Zone Headquarters, battalion commander of the 107th Division, company commander of the Heavy Artillery Machine Gun Company, and Lieutenant Colonel Instructor of the Guizhou Military Control Zone Headquarters. He vehemently denies the case of shooting his mistress Kun-ling Zhang Yu-yan and her husband. He also said that he felt very sorry for Yu-yan's life experience. His help to her was purely out of compassion, with no ambiguous elements. Later, the Military Judge Wang Yu-wu ordered the tea room waiter Xu A-rong from the Dongxin Inn and the girl Zhang Da-hei, who was also in the room at the time of the incident, to be brought to the scene to identify him. The victim's father, Zhang Yu-ting, also said: "Zhang committed pursued Yu-yan. The first physical relationship occurred at the Yongan Hotel in Nanjing." The presiding judge then said to Zhang committed: "The evidence is solid. Think again. The cash cow on which the whole family of Yu-ting depends has been completely sent away by you. Can you get through with your conscience?" After listening, Zhang was slightly touched. After a while, he said, "They were definitely not killed by me, but because I am the most suspected, I am willing to die."</p>
<p>Cunning Scheme</p>
<p>Exhausting Interrogation</p>
<p>Because the Military Law Office could not get to the point, they began exhausting interrogation. Zhang committed even said to the judge: "The law is very powerful. I can't make trouble for myself in my confession." The judge retorted: "Do you think that if you don't admit the case, the law will be helpless against you?" Zhang committed smiled without answering at the time. According to the interrogation process released by Military Judge Wang, Zhang Ji-ming is a soldier, but he has been infected with strong vulgar habits. He is involved in eating, dressing, prostitution, and gambling. Therefore, he is very experienced in the world. He may even have done interrogation work. Therefore, he uses his own cleverness and experience in his confessions before and after the occurrence of this case. This is definitely not the method of an ordinary soldier. In the end, the military judge often used sharp eyes to stare at the face of the prisoner, forcing Zhang to bow his head with righteousness, showing weakness, to the point of stammering and having to confess the truth, admitting all the crimes.</p>
<p>Extreme Penalty</p>
<p>Very Possible</p>
<p>Recently, within and outside the city, in places such as Dongchengjiao, Shafuning, Dongxin Road, and Huishan, blood cases have occurred continuously. Commander Liu of the City Defense Department called the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters to ask for instructions on how to handle Xiao Shi-yang, a soldier of a certain unit who beat to death a firewood owner, and Zhang Ji-ming, the perpetrator of this case. Commander-in-chief Tang Enbo immediately instructed Liu to handle it in accordance with military law and authorized him to execute them on the spot. He also expressed great concern about the local public order, saying that anyone who disrupts public order or spreads rumors to confuse the public can be arrested and shot on the spot. It is reported that Commander Liu has decided to comply with the order, so the two perpetrators, Xiao and Zhang, can be sentenced in the short term, and they are likely to be sentenced to extreme penalty.</p>

It has also telegraphed to each county government to strictly prohibit such practices and to investigate the matter.</p>
