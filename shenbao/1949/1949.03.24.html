<h3>增加和談代表名額　今日首次政務會可決定</h3>
<p>何院長定下週飛穗辦理交接</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕何應欽新閣定廿四日上午十時，在總統府舉行首次政務會議，計全體委員十七人，除傅秉常在蘇聯，杭立武，莫德惠在台，張羣在川，戴愧生在穗外，餘均可於廿四日集京，人數已足法定，可舉行正式會議。會中將首由何應欽致詞，就當前局勢情况，及邀全體閣員互策互勵，以度危局等，予以說明，並進行討論議題，主要者為和談代表之名額及人選，及出發日期之預擬，並廣泛交換施政方針之意見。何氏並定於新閣正式成立後，於下週偕黃少谷飛穗一行，俾與孫閣進行交接，刻業已由孫閣携穗之政院印信，亦將於此行携返南京應用。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕和談代表之增派，何應飲於廿三日下午四時，邀約張治中，邵力子，翁文灝等，作初步研討，聞在人選上，除現有張治中，邵力子，黃紹茲三氏外，餘額曾提出章士釗，莫德惠等。在名額上擬自五人增至六人，惟均未作決定，俟廿四日之政務會議中再廣徵多數閣員之意見，作最後決定。何氏並卽晚謁代總統報告一切。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕據悉：章士釗已允出任政府和談代表團之代表，此為廿三日之決定。晚間何應欽曾與章氏通長途電話，徵得章氏同意。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿三日電〕李代總統之顧問甘介侯，今日與聯合社記者談稱：一俟政府派定代表，卽可與共方開始和談。我方和談代表人數及和談日期，均可由政府決定。和談地點則任共方選擇。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿三日電〕此間未證實報告，謂國共兩方均司望在月底以前宣佈和談代表名單。權威方面復謂和談方式，將類似一九四五年十月十日在重慶舉行之國共和談，如雙方得就毛澤東之八項和談條件為基礎而進行談判，則第三黨代表亦可參加和談。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿三日電〕據接近李代總統人士稱：政府對和平的態度，並不因最近的政治及軍事發展而有所改變。渠力斥長江北岸共軍的調動頻繁將影嚮和平前途之說，渠稱：此種軍事行動係在意料中者，因「吾人亦在備戰求和，吾人當然不能希望共軍不作軍事佈署」。</p>
<h3>中共對和談廣播　表示時期益迫近</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日陜北中共電台廣播橋中，對和談一事，表示：「和談時期現已日益迫近」，此點透示共產黨仍欲與現府舉行談判，同時政府方面之何應欽新閣業已組成，透露和平代表團可望於四月初啓程赴平，此可視為目前時局發展中的一個重要契機。共產黨認為和談日期已近，一俟和平談判開始，政府究竟繼續戰爭，抑接受執行共黨之八項和平條件，卽可見其分曉，此點反映共產黨仍將堅持八點為其談判之基本原則。昨日中共廣播中評述何應欽內閣，謂何氏十八日在南京監察院招待會席上宣布渠之內閣為和平內閣，但何應欽斷語是否符合事實，旣不能從渠之內閣各單求證實，亦不能從渠之宣言來證實，故在這個和平談判中不知南京政府將扮演什麼樣角色。此外，中共在此一廣播稿中，對於美國及蔣總統仍作極猛烈之抨擊，謂美國繼續援助並策動戰爭。</p>

<h3>央行高價拋售金銀　監委將作政策糾正　唐鴻烈等返京報告來滬調查經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕赴滬調查央行高價拋售金銀案之監委唐鴻烈，胡文暉兩氏，廿三日晨自滬返抵京，下車後卽晋謁于院長，報告赴滬調查經過，並於上午院會中就該案作剖析與說明，對於央行現執行之金銀拋售政策，將提出政策上之糾正。又央行在滬拋售金銀時，其定價係由平準會參酌市價決定，該會中亦有審計部之代表參加，惟並不負決定價格責任。唐。胡兩氏認為，似有撤回必要。廿三日晨晋謁于院長並說明此意，于氏已表示將撤回该會中之審計部代表。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕政府在上海所實行之拋售金銀政策，現已成為投機取巧者投機之對象，渠等興風作浪，操縱把持，顯己將政府拋售金銀之政策擊收，此項政策固不失為應急於一時之辦法，但決非永久之策，欲求經濟之穩定，必須另作根本之圖，對於足以助長投機之拋售金銀政策，必須及時加以糾正，監委唐鴻烈，胡文暉二氏赴滬調查國行拋售金銀事歸來後，廿三日在監院報告調查經過時，曾作如上之結論。唐氏廿三日在院會上報告時，首分析國行拋售金銀政策之由來，謂當孫內閣成立伊始，當時曾擬以財政金融貿易三部分聯為一體，以便增加財政收入，减少發行，惟以種種原因，預定之計劃並未能做到。中央銀行代理國庫從二月一日起至廿八日止，三月一日起至十九日止奉財部令應付之款為數甚鉅，其中一部為政費，另一部為臨時費，除已張羅付出者外，未付者卽達四百億元，加之物價日高，籌碼不敷，鈔荒之日形嚴重，央行為採取對策，卽實行拋售金銀，其目的有三：（一）調節金融，（二）打擊投機，（三）緩和物價上漲，當時拋出之黃金，計達四萬餘兩，十八·十九兩日拋出之銀元，計達三十三萬餘枚，拋售之辦法分明配與暗拋兩種，明配係分配於各銀樓，暗拋則係委托交通銀行通過經紀人拋出，當時物價雖曾有一二日之穩定，旋復劇烈波動，而鈔荒之嚴重亦未為之稍减，嗣復又拋出相當數目之美鈔，始又收數日之功效。旋唐氏卽說明兩人調查後共同之見解四點：（一）今日軍政之費用浩繁，收支不平衡之現象，一天天加深，通貨膨脹亦日益加甚，一月之內，收出常增加數倍，情形實甚為嚴重。（二）拋售金銀只能收效三五日，過此物價卽又大漲，非僅不能穩定物價，且反刺激物價，拋售之技術，實大值懷疑，而國家之金銀財富有限，以有限之金銀，依投機者之投機，並不能收效於永久，實應愼重考慮。在上海之所以形成如此投機取巧之現象，唐氏分析其原因，不外五點：甲，大家對金元券太無信心，因之拿金元券儘量兌取金銀美鈔，金銀美鈔遂流為投機之對象。乙，上海投機取巧者腦筋敏銳，觀察深刻，手段高明，政府所定之辦法，皆不能逃此等狡猾者之手掌。丙·上海軍政機關太多，軍公款項亦常參加投機。丁·上海之銀行錢莊，多勾通一氣，協同一致，均以政府為對象，尋求岡利機會。戊·據種種跡象觀察，顯有毫門資本及特殊勢力從中作崇。有上五因，拋售金銀政策非僅不能打擊投機，且反助長投機，政策之本身，恐亦不無問題。三十八日滬市上銀元價七千餘元，央行以七千元拋出，自非高於市價，惟彼時上海以外之各地之銀元，多在七千元以下，因受滬　　央行以七千元拋出影嚮，隨之高漲，並引起物價波動，央行顯不能辭疏忽之咎。此點，央行人士已表示係考慮欠週。拋售時多經過經紀人之手，他們常以化整為零收進後，以化零為整拋出，其中是否有豪門作祟，應值密切注意。唐氏於結論中稱：拋售金銀政策，非根本之計，亟應從根本上努力，以改善當前之經濟。</p>
<h3>皖鄂共軍節節南移　潛山被佔安慶已受威脅　淆水守軍亦轉進至城郊</h3>
<p>〔本報安慶廿三日電〕據國防部本日通報稱：共軍第六第七兩縱隊，已由合肥南竄至巢縣附近。另據空軍今晨之偵察報告，共軍第三縱隊正由桐城南下，先頭部隊已抵達安慶東北地區。兩局來蘇北鄂東各地共軍紛紛南逼，皖中共軍之南移，當亦係配合其整個行動。</p>
<p>〔中央社安慶廿三日電〕皖中共軍刻向此間進擾，廿一日夜淮佔潛山及高河埠，國軍正加强佈置，堅守安慶。</p>

<h3>社論　外長更迭與外交政策</h3>
<p>何內閣的閣員名單發表之後，大家覺得新閣的陣容，除了人才資望方面，一般覺得分量稍據不够外，不能不說已有相當的進步。因為無論如何，此較從前兩次內閣，似乎有一番新氣象。而最惹人注目的，莫過於外長一職調回駐蘇聯大使傳秉常出任。照一般的看法，傳氏出使莫斯科達五六年之久，或許比較明瞭蘇聯的政情及其對華態度，而今返國出任外長，中國的外交政策當可發生激劇的變化。所以，這幾天來，向來以捕風捉影為能事的外國通訊社，對於傳氏出任外長，又復亂發消息，不是說中國的外交政策將放棄華盛頓路綫，改走莫斯科路綫，就是說國民黨內對於外長人選問題發生極大的紛歧。甚至還有些電報說，傅氏出長外交，係張治中和邵力子　氏以去就力爭的結果。這些謠諑的紛傳，由我們常識來判斷，有多少事實的根據大有疑問，而且也不值得識者的一笑。任何一國的外交政策，都有其不可移動的基調，初不因人事的更迭而改絃易轍的。我們願乘此時機，與全國朝野檢討一下我國的外交政策。</p>
<p>數千年來我國人民習於自尊自大，向稱中國為天下，毫無近代的國際觀念。直到晚淸，中國門戶洞開之後，才知道天下除了中國而外，還有許多國家；但對於外國，仍視為夷狄，旣不願以平等地位待之，又不屑研討世界大勢，更不明外交為何物，只知辦洋務為新政而已。顢預的親貴，貧鄙的大臣，使中國的一部外交史，充滿了恥辱和汚點，令人不忍卒讀。就是到了中華民國誕生之後，如火如荼的五四運動，雖使一般靑年深知「國民外交」的重要，但中了「弱國無外交」的陳腐觀念之毒，二三十年來，我國在外交方面迄無輝煌的成就。</p>
<p>我們研究個中的道理，並不是因為國內沒有外交家，而是在於辦理外交的人為若干錯誤的觀念所一誤再誤。舉個實例而言吧：譬如衆所週知的「以夷制夷」，在外交的運用上，固不失為外交手段之一，但在運用時必須具備若干先決條件，如果自己站不住脚跟，妄想運用「以夷制夷」的手段，則其結果必致演出「前門拒虎後門進狼」的悲劇。我國外交史上的實例，不一而足，我們必須接受歷史的敎訓，而有一番澈悟，其實中國辦外交，我們以為只有「言忠信，行篤敬」六個大字，應該是我們的寶典，再說得簡括一些，「誠」而已矣。「誠者物之終始，不誠無物」。天下事，就是尋常日用，社交往來之間，當不能缺乏一個「誠」字，而謂國際之間可以玩弄手段，拋却誠信嗎？或以為世變日亟，縱橫捭團之風盛行，中國名雖大婚，而軟弱無力，若講誠信，寗不顧慮被欺？殊不知惟其國力不够，更應矢志不變其誠信，惟誠才能格物，才能感人，才能收得道多助之效，而決非朝奏暮楚之徒所能夢想有意外之收穫者。</p>
<p>我國自抗戰以來，國民政府之外交政策，一貫採取獨立自主的方針。任何國家的友誼援助。我們俱所感激；而任何國家的蓄意侵侮，我們都難忍受。美國對華，無領土野心，而多年援助，無非要希望中國能成為一個獨立民主而强盛的國家，以維繫戰後東亞之和平。中國人民之樂於接受美國之友誼，亦為此故，而並無所謂「親美」，更不是倒在美國懷抱之中。乃若干人因為從前對美希望過奢，而不反求諸己，一旦覺得美援不能如吾人希望之多，就反而詛咒美國，甚且發為美國如再不加强援助，我將轉而「親蘇」，殊為可怪。若干外國記者不察此僅為少數人的偏見幻想，於是一看到傳大使調任外長，就神經過敏，揣測此為中國外交政策改變之兆。我們以為不然。</p>
<p>第一，傳大使是否願意返國出任外長，尙在考慮之中，即使傳大使首肯，返國就職，亦不能謂駐蘇大使必定「親蘇」，一定要走莫斯科路綫的。試以蒲立德先生而論，他是今日美國主張反蘇的健將，但他曾任駐蘇聯大使。何况傳大使在蘇數年，究竟見過史太林莫洛托夫幾次，蘇聯對他的估價如何，都成問題，即便要「親蘇」，也沒有這般容易。</p>
<p>第二，以中國現行的外交政策而論，還是以獨立自主的立塲，走的中間路綫，一方面固然歡迎美國的經濟援助和軍事援助，但在另一方面與蘇聯仍訂有三十年中蘇同盟友好條約，中蘇關係的友好，並不亞於中美關係。果如所傳，中國外交政策眞將走莫斯科路綫，但究有何種補益，很是一個嚴重問題。這種搖擺不定，中心無主的做法，必將陷中國於危險的深淵。</p>
<p>第三，以國際形勢而言，自大西洋公約的內容宣佈後，東西兩極間的冷戰，更加愈演愈烈，但相信一時尙不至於變為熱戰。中國為太平洋一個大國，在太平洋公約行將醞釀之際，中國尤須愼重我們的舉措，始終保持我們反對極權侵略的態度，使世界民主國家能堅强其陣綫，以表示世界戰火不容極權侵略國家之牽爾重燃，庶幾玩火者可以知所戒懼，新的國際戰爭也許可以避免。正當美國五十名以上參議員（佔總額之過半數）署名要求加强援華之時，而竟謂政府反將改走莫斯科路綫，不要說何內閣沒有這樣笨，就使何內閣要如此做，人民也未必肯罷。</p>

<h3>太平洋區諸國家　七月中可締盟約　英聯邦會議將先行商談</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕此間英美高級外交界人士相信，太平洋區之諸國在四個月內卽可成立一聯訪安全公約，以保議其本國士地肪止共產主義之長驅侵入。大西洋西岸之外交界，今已開始鄭重研究安置太平洋公約基石的工作，此一公約及卽將正式簽字的大西洋公約將為英美集國維護世界安全與和平的政策之基石。據云，英政府之定於四月廿三日在倫敦召開英共和聯邦總理會議，卽係以太平洋公約為其主要動機。美國方面殆巳向英表示，太平洋公約旣必須以英共和聯邦之參加為必要先決條件，故在正式召開太平洋公約會議之前，必須先行確定英共和聯邦對此事之意見。此間外界專家預料，如下月召開之英共和聯邦總理會議經過順利，則太平洋公約會議可望於五月後半月在美京開會，而該公釣至遲於今年七月卽可成為事實。由於大西洋公約已堪為太平洋公約援為先例，故後者討論之際，不致有任何重大困難。英美官員承認太平洋公約之動機，主要的在於亞洲及遠東區民主國家遭遇的惡化，同時亦由於蘇聯有將冷戰陣地自歐洲移至亞洲之跡象，中國·緬甸·越南·以及印尼等地共產勢力之積極擴張，已使關於太平洋方面的決議成為一重大問題。美國前此一向主張對殖民地之艮族運運表示同情，但由於共產勢力之擴張不已，美國是否尙宜在遠東方面保留此一傳統政策，實為一困難的決定。此間關係方面並料太平洋公約之加入國，可以確定者當為美國（包括太平洋區之托管島嶼）英國（包括其太平洋區之殖民地）法國·荷蘭（均包括其太平洋區之殖民地）澳洲·紐西蘭·印度·巴基斯坦·銀蘭·及加拿大。可能被邀參加者，有暹羅·及菲律賓，至於尙待其國內局勢之澄淸始有加入之機會者，則有中國·日本·韓國·緬甸等。</p>
<h3>太平洋公約成立以後　可削弱殖民地運動　美近已同意英方之意見</h3>

<p>在越南方面：法國與越盟國民黨之戰，擬續兩年有餘，迄無間歇，太平洋公約實現之後，法國可能根據該約獲得外援，以敉平越境武裝叛亂。</p>
<p>印尼方面：荷蘭之軍事行動雖暫時佔有上風，然前途隱憂重重，太平洋公約之成立，可使荷蘭獲得物質上及道義上的支援。</p>
<p>緬甸方面：緬政府對國內之武裝叛亂已有不支之勢，且已向英印乞援，太平洋公約之成立，自可使緬政府得以假借外援，應付內亂。</p>

<h3>無頭碎屍案　發現重要綫索　重賞查緝江心丟包婦人　毛黃足巨體格魁悟　死者可能非本國人　削滅指紋兇手用心週密</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕謹記路發現無頭碎屍案，至昨已為第三日，全案主要綫索在各方努力偵查下，已大有收穫。</p>
<p>該案首為警局偵查人員全力注意之焦點，在此項屍體究從何處移來？根據初步調查，出事地點保甲辦公處幹事張文能認為，此事決非鄉區農民所為，渠斷定該屍由市區移往謹記路之路綫，可能係來自衡山路·宛平路·林森路三條。但嗣經偵查人員自宛平路出發，經徐家匯車站，蒲西路「路加診療所」，折回沿徐家匯路河浜，過天鑰橋，謹記橋，楓林橋，沿途注意河畔有無血色，舊貨攤販有無曾出售油布·女襖·棉胎·旅行袋等件，結果未有所獲。</p>
<p>警局現有一假定，卽兇手支解屍體之工作，若非在市區內做成，則必係於距上海並不太遠之處完成者。足以證明此假定之根據有二：一為包裹屍體之條子布非本市產品，但可能係有小型紡織業部市之鄰近區域所產，次為法醫檢定死者由被殺至移屍完成，總計未逾四十八小時。現警局已着手製成一以上海為中心之對外交通圖表，包括飛機，輪船，火車，汽車，在上述時間限度內可達之處，然後研究一可能性較大之地點，進行重點偵查，同時並通告各地路警，司機，旅客，及出差汽車，三輪車等，回憶數日前曾否有任何人携帶類似該案型色之包裹，儘量向警局檢舉或密報。</p>
<p>此面獎勵密報工作迄昨止，已有一重大收獲。據確息：廿二日上午八時，在由浦西開赴浦東楊家渡之保泰渡輪上，曾有一婦人將笨重包裹一件突然拋入江心，且神色極為慌張。該婦人年約四旬外，短衫褲，鄉農模樣，唯一之特徵係左眼為螺殼眼。目前因此人不知何往，無從傳詢，但相信或與此案有重要關聯。據警局聲稱：渠等決不惜任何代價，希望有人能提供對該案之各種綫索，包括此婦人之行蹤在內。</p>
<p>擄警局法醫第三次檢驗屍體結果，認定死者喉管軟骨已硬，故推斷其應屬四十許人，再死者於未被殺害前喉管有又傷跡象，此點可能為其致命之處。其次死者之陰毛腋毛均帶黃白色。頸肉粗壯，足部特大，肌肉堅實，死者生前營養似極良好，凡此又可推斷為死者或非國人，今日警局將再度往騐其腿毛，以求證實。據分局長程義寬表示，人體毛髪自頂至踵必為同型同色，果死者頭顱尙在，則於偵查工作上必可有極大帮助，但凶手於移屍前已將頭顱棄却，由此證明渠早顧慮死者頭髮可資偵查之用。又以屍體上手指足趾盡被斬棄一點以觀，（僅留一拇指，但指紋亦已削去）更足見凶手深明死者指紋落入警員手中之重要性。凶手其為一十足「內行」，且必深請解剖學，當毫無疑義。</p>
<p>我國戶籍稽錄工作迄未能盡臻完善，實為偵查刑事案件時之最大遺憾。謹記路有一棄屍，則各地人口中必有失踪一人，但該案發生後，迄未見有任何失踪報告。現警局已決公告徵詢，各地在近期內是否發現有突告失踪之人，或曾在任何地方發現有被拋棄之人體內臟，手指足趾及頭顱等，俾可對案情作進一步之瞭解。據警局方面談：渠等起初曾懷疑該屍是否可能為醫學機構在解剖完畢後所拋棄？但繼經詢得，解剖慣例從不割下頭顱，無須斬去手指足趾，同時自更無支解數十塊之必要。</p>
<p>此外昨日常熟路分局警員張惠宇在偵查該案後曾談及，渠因聞龍華分局警長張楨閒談二十九日午夜十二時，渠由分局步返斜徐路謹記橋寓所，途經山東會館門前，曾聽見館內有叫駡而至毆擊之嘈雜聲等語。張頗起疑實，遂往山東會館調查，知其中住有難民五六十人，據負責人張子和稱：渠等平時一向安份自重，並否認十九日夜間有吵駡情事。嗣張又密赴該所附近各村落作個別訪問，結果曾留下一詳細之記錄，以作參考。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕謹記路支解屍體案，地檢處女檢察官汪優琴偕法醫前往同仁輔元堂檢騐，刻正草擬報告書，並已着手偵查。</p>
<h3>取締一百八十五種刋物　香港三報亦禁銷　未經核准登記許可銷售者有四種</h3>

<h3>南北通航問題　航業界推六代表　晋京報告普請示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南北通航問題，自本市航業界四代表由華北歸來後，各航業團體及民營船公司間，卽不斷保特接觸，就中共提出之通航方案與細則，縝密商討，以備歸納全體意見，提供政府參考。昨午後四時，本市各航業領袖，復假海鷹輪船公司，邀集中央銀行，市商會，市工業會，全國商聯會等機關代表，交換意見，並卽席推出魏文瀚，楊管北，胡時淵，李雲良，沈瑛等六人為代表，定今晚乘夜車晋京，謁何院長報告航業界前次北上洽談通航經過，並將中共擬定之方案，及本市各界之意見，提出請示。加得核准，卽可公佈方案全文，決定實施日期。昨會中商談內容，與會代表均堅決拒絕向外間透露。</p>
<h3>公用事業今起漲價七成　假定指數為二三五〇倍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各項公用事業價格，自今日起，將按照上次參議會通過之辦法，照估計指數調整。據各公用事業公司及公共交通公司消息：公用事業新價為以基價乘二千三百五十倍之假定指數，約較原價漲百分之七十左右。至電車，公共汽車等各項新價，正由各公司漏夜核算中，今日起卽將實行。公共交通價格可維持至下月八日為止，水，電，煤氣，及電話價格，於下月一日起，將再按照下期職工生活費指數計價，多退少補。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕水電煤氣等公用事業新價按基數自動調整後，一般消耗量似並無顯著之節省。電力公司自來水公司煤氣公司等供應數字，因須過月終後始能結算，故尙未能作準確之比較。惟據各該公司負責人談：大致均與以前差不多，例如上海電力公司每日發電量仍在三百萬以上，其中工業用電之供應亦較前無甚增加。</p>
<h3>何院長懇切挽留　吳市長辭意未消　下月初將偕夫人遊杭州</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪吳市長，叩詢旣經新閣何院長懇切挽留，市長辭意是否可望打消？市長答：渠並未接到該項電令。至於將辭職改成假期間題，渠認為不甚妥當。因上海環境複雜困難，非傾全力以赴，問題無法解決。故由他人替代實甚困難。且於二個月假滿後，是否卽可恢復健康，亦難預測，故仍將堅決請辭云。至報載市長夫人業已遷往台灣之說，市長竭力否認，稱夫人安居上海。下月初起，渠將擺脫一切，携夫人同往杭州遊春。深信大好山水對渠之病體大有裨益也。</p>
<p>又昨日市參議員唐世昌等卅餘人，一致簽名挽留吳市長及各局長，請打銷辭意。</p>

<h3>火車箱屍案　限半月破獲　廿四天來獲具體綫索</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕火車箱屍案自本月初在北站發現以來，迄今已二十四天。在此二十四天中，雖經兩路警務處努力偵查，仍乏具體綫索。警務處錢鶴　處長以此案案情重大，務須迅速破獲，故於昨日手諭該案承辦員警，限半月內破案。</p>
<p>本市某電影製片公司對箱屍案甚感興趣，認為若能以此曲折離奇之案情，略加潤飾，編成一恐怖緊張偵探故事，攝成影片，必能轟動一時，生意有絕對把握，該公司昨特派員赴兩路局訪問各有關部份負責人，有所接洽云。</p>

<h3>流亡學生續有抵滬　照顧乏人表示失望　平津無生活自由為出走主因</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕連日華北學生不斷有流亡來滬者。昨日「景與」，「利泰」二輪又自靑島載來大中學生二百五十餘人。彼等生活困苦，大多衣食不週，來滬係由靑島市府臨時救濟委員會代為設法免費艙位。昨日上午抵埠後，卽携行李去社會局及敎育局請求解決食宿及南行之交通問題。經社敎二局會商後，除在滬有戚友或有力借住旅舍者外，其餘均送往漕河涇市救濟會第三收容所暫住。一面由社敎二局向路局接治去杭車票，所需車費由市救濟會設法。去杭後將向敎部靑年復學就業輔導委員會接洽就學問題，敎部有在福建籌設東南大學訊，彼等均寄予熱切期望。</p>
<p>該二百五十餘男女學生分隸北大·師大·朝陽·東北大學·長春大學·長白師範·東北臨中·東北中山中學等校。彼等係在中共進佔北平前後，陸續由平津出走濟南，經濰縣而至靑島者。最近離平之一批，時在本月初旬。據談：中共進駐北平後，除原有各校外，設立大學三所。其中軍政大學係培養軍隊幹部之所，校長葉劍英。華北大學之前身卽抗日大學，校長吳玉章，目的在培養政治幹部。另華北人民革命大學設於西郊，該校入學程度自小學至大學不等，現有學生一萬多人。踝程有政治常識及革命思想等。訓練畢業後去鄉間工作。</p>
<p>平津東北學生萬人什一出走</p>
<p>至原遷平津之東北各大中學校，中共已於二月二十八日將各校遷回長春·哈爾濱·瀋陽各地。在平津之東北學生有一萬多人，現出走南下者約有十分之一。彼等認為，在中共控制下之北平，無生活目由，因此不選艱危南下。但抵滬後，政府照顧乏人，頗使彼等失望。據稱，華北各校學生尙有欲南下者，彼等急切盼望政府對此事能負責多加照顧。</p>
<p>市敎育局聲明並未代辦登記</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市敎育局因昨日報載華北流亡學生由敎局代辦登記消息一則，特聲明：「敎部並未委託該局代辦流亡學生登記。惟敎部靑年復學就業輔導委員會曾於本月十六日委派余孝慈君携帶臨時救濟費二百萬元由杭來滬，籌辦流亡學生登記遺送事宜。余君與敎局洽商結果，以救濟流亡學生工作至為繁重，須由敎部在滬專設機構負責辦理，並須有固定之預算，方可有濟於事，余君卽於當晚携同救濟費二百萬元返杭請示，至今尙未來滬」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中央航空公司於戰後在美國訂購Convair客機六架，其中兩架業已交貨，將於本月底自美飛至香港。此稱Convair機係世界最新式客機之一種，其性能據悉較「空申覇王」機尤佳，尤以速度特高，每小時可飛三百英哩以上，為他種飛機所不及。其內部設備則與「空中覇王」機類似，機內全部沙發座位，溫度與氣壓自動調節，引擎聲音全部隔絕，旅客不會有耳痛嘔吐心悸等高空飛行不舒適感覺。該機引擎兩具，馬力特大，作用相當於「室中霸王」機四個引擎。其缺點則在於不耐長途飛行，故此次自美飛港，不能取道橫越太平洋之捷徑，而係繞道歐菲，蓋以中途站較多可降落加油也。又此種客機特別華貴，需要良好之機塲，除香港外，目前國內機塲堪供使用者，僅上海北平兩地。將來如北平可以通航後，該公司卽將以此種飛機飛行港滬平綫，自港至滬兩小時卽可抵達，港平航程當日可以來回。聞公司當局或將以此種飛機定名為「空中皇宮」號云。</p>

<p>儀徵三景　〔上〕城內鼓樓〔中〕北城門〔下〕城門最前綫之碉堡。　（本報特派員凌松壽攝）</p>
<h3>蘇北孤城　儀徵</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江十九日訊〕十六日午後，記者偕鎭地同業數人，應儀徵縣長左治人之邀，登上來迎接的專論，到這津浦路以東長江北岸僅剩的一座縣城作一番巡視。</p>
<p>南北岸交通封鎖後的長江，用什麼字眼兒也形容不出它的死寂，一樣的是彼浪滔滔，東流無盡，然而江面上已很難看到一隻船，天空中佈滿灰色的雲，是要下雨的樣子，過去風帆上下的圖晝，只有使人把回憶的影子投到現實的深淵中去。</p>
<p>跨馬上儀徵</p>
<p>薄暮時分，我們駛抵了泗源溝，江面上停泊了一艘「聯勝」艦，泗源溝距離儀徵城還有四華里，在這四華里長的一條公路中及其兩側，目前已築就了半永久性的橋頭堡工事，儀徵城則在橋頭堡工事以外，據左治人縣長相告：這段公路是儀徵城向南僅有的一條退路，而聯勝艦也將是儀徵城唯一的可靠的支持者。天已經開始下着濛濛細雨，他跨上了馬，得得蹄聲，陪着我們向儀徵城北去。左縣長和縣保安第一團陳策安團長郊迎城外，暮色朦朧中我們見了面，步行人城。</p>
<p>儀徵城墻是那樣的低，低得連城防工事似乎都得不到利用，街道上，我們隱約地可以看見用磚塊堆起來的巷戰工事。工事旁邊，或交叉路口，有民衆盤查哨站崗，長袍大掛，手執木棍，喝起一聲「口令！」來，顯得很有精神。老百姓們有些偷偷在門口向我們張望，不知居處在孤城中的他們，對我們這一批作為縣長的嘉賓的西裝客有着些什麼期待？</p>
<p>孤城興衰史</p>
<p>近百年的儀徵，有它的一頁興衰史，八十多家珠寶店，七十二家當舖，這一片繁華的影子，被紅羊之亂的一把火燒完了，然而城東南的十二圩鎭，直至戰前為止，依然是淮鹽的運銷集散地，擁有十三萬以上的人口，可惜運河改道由瓜洲入江而後，揚州到十二圩的一段運河淤塞不通，祇可航駛小型木船，十二圩的地位一落千丈，再加上抗戰期間的破壞，十二圩冷落了，儀徵也就更冷落了起來。今天，十二圩的洋房大屋，大部拆光，成為一座重要的橋頭堡陣地；而儀徵呢，孤城一座，困據江濱，城區人口祇剩下了四千三百餘人，看看城內那一條冷寂的長街，和全城處處瓦礫的荒凉局面，實在令人意識到繁華夢對儀徵是愈來愈遙遠，愈來愈迷糊了！</p>
<p>蘇北地區在政府整個政略和戰略的轉變下幾乎全部放棄，揚·泰·通·三州先後撤守，而江邊上這座孤城儀徵却留了下來，這在共軍的土幹部是感覺到不可思議的，一月下旬，儀徵於國軍自六合·天長·揚州·泰縣相繼撤退以後，開始了其一面憑江，三面受敵的命運，舊歷年前後，土共二〇八，二〇三兩支隊和東南支隊諸部，均先後來攻該城，共軍打到了城邊，在北門外向着守軍喊話，「到這邊來過年啊，臘肉，鹹鷄，還有前門牌香烟！」在縣保安團隊與駐軍的配合下，儀徵屹然未動。左治人縣長和機位軍政負責人八日夜沒睡好覺，這時縣政府裏面剩下縣長，某科長和警察局高重華局長三人。</p>
<p>緊張的現局</p>
<p>共軍的攻勢雖然暫行停止，但是孤城的情勢，一天緊張似一天，原來就不大的儀徵縣境，全縣十三個鄉鎭中，現在祇剩下了十二圩和城區兩鎭，還不太完整，出產的地區控制不上，軍糧民食成問題，縣府原來有一個保安團，新近又成立了一個，保安團隊的糧秣按例是由地方負担的，縣府財政來源有二處，主要的是田賦，在戰前，儀徵的田賦經常收不足百分之七十，平日的開支有十分之六要靠十二圩。月前老百姓租穀都收不到，田賦自然談不上，此外還有自治稅捐的收入，包括房捐，娛樂稅，筵席稅，營業稅，屠宰稅等，據道個月的統計，月入尙不足四十萬元，四十萬，自然是一筆渺小的數字，不過看看儀徵城內是那樣的殘破，不但我以為向民間征稅是一種殘忍，縣長也如此說，在這種情况之下，單就保安團隊月需糧餉二千餘石米而論，自然除了向江南的省方要求接濟而外，便只有到共軍控制區去搶他們的公糧了！儀徵縣政府職員的二月份薪水到現在沒有發，保安團官兵的餉，從一月份起到現在也沒有關，封江以後，外來的縣府職員和保甲長等等都已跑光，好的左治人縣長是轉業軍官出身，他還有一批編餘軍官的朋友，能够拉過來跟着他吃苦。</p>
<p>記者抵儀三小時以內，所見所聞，就是這麼一個荒掠而艱苦的輪廓。在四五支快慢機的前後保護之下，藉着手電筒微弱的光，我們於參加了縣府的「歡宴」而後，縣長陪着我們走着黑暗而泥濘的街道，送我們到旅館中休息。</p>
<p>是風斜雨細的天晴，是料峭春寒之夜晚，旅邸孤燈，荒城犬吠，環繞我們周圍的是一片凄凉和沉寂，我脫下上裝，鑽進冰凉而油膩的一倏薄被中和衣而睡，雨點聲中，我似乎隱約地聽到深夜中從北面傳來的零落的槍聲。這邊人都說：「槍聲是日常生活中的點綴。」自然我也不感覺到驚異。</p>
<p>蜡廟陣地</p>
<p>第二天淸晨，陳策安團長陪同我們赴城北五華里外的據點——　蜡廟地視察。北門外這一條路一個月前還是不安靖地區，自上次丁治磐主席來儀視察後，指示應當將　蜡廟這個據點控制住，這條路才有行人。</p>
<p>蜡廟在一座土　之上，與在它東面的北山寺，同為儀徵城北的屏陣，我們在碉堡之勞，憑高遠眺，在三四華里的一座松林中發現了正在那裏活動的一列共軍。砰！砰！槍聲響了，對着這個目標發了幾槍。前面的哨兵也響應着據點射去了幾下。我嗅到一陣濃重的火藥味。　蜡廟和北山寺，都是大寺院，現在廟宇已經拆光，只有一株老樹參天，還司以帶給人一種蒼凉的回味。土　附近過去是一片楓林，在儀徵八景之中有「北山紅葉」之稱。如今也祇有戰壕蜿曲，碉堡林立，等着不幸的鮮血來替這一片不幸的土地抹上一片紅色了！我向南遙望，長江如絲，江南諸山，隱隱於靑絲之間。儀徵城內天寗寺的寶塔，也瞭然在望。這寺在五省聯軍總司令孫傳芳率部渡江之時，是孫的總部所在地。今日大江南北，「渡江」之說，響澈雲霄，不必翻開遙遠的歷史，就這三十年來的時移世變，也眞够人感慨系之了！</p>
<p>返鎭江途中</p>
<p>返城途中，記者把街道看得較為親切。這裏自長江南北岸交通封銷後，江南物資，不易運來，儘管消費的人有限，而一般物價已高於鎭江五倍左右。南北門一條大街，商店佔不到十分之一二。城北似乎是一個「趕集」的地方，攤販很多。米賣二萬元一石，比江南雖說便宜，但是民食的來源，也已只剩下從共區裏偷偷地運來這一條路了。儀徵能走的人早已走了，留下來的，都是不準備或沒辦法走的。他們對局面的演變顯得很不關心，其實，身處危城，要關心也關心不了。</p>
<p>十七日午後，記者又登輪返鎭。碼頭上亂糟糟地，這位是軍官太太，那作是某人的親戚，大家搶着上船南去。這對封鎖長江似乎是一個諷刺！大家對儀徵似乎多無所留戀，儀徵將來的命運，讓事實的發展情勢去騐證吧。</p>

<p>在城區規模最大的紡織廠。也是常州紡織業的雙星。是大成廠和民豐廠。大成在常共設三個廠。第一廠是基本廠。在南門外。抗戰前，原有紗錠二萬零五百枚。綫錠四千八百枚。在八年抗戰烽火裏，委曲求全，勉力苦撑。勝利後，刦餘生機，勞費整頓，現開紗錠二萬九千七百枚。綫錠移三廠裝紡。目前日產棉紗七十四五件，所紡紗支為四二支，三二支，二二支二〇支，及副一〇支。除副一〇支及一部份二〇支為售紗外，餘均供布廠部自織之用。機織部在戰前原有七五六台，抗戰中織機及廠屋完全燬於兵變。勝利之年，在廢墟上力事重建。鋼骨和水泥，水泥和鋼骨，鳩工庀材，越時一年多，到卅六年底五四〇台的新生布機又跳動了。卅七年四月起，逐漸增加，八月始開足舊數七五六台，足見恢復的不容易。現在日夜產布，一二磅細布七二〇疋。紗府綢坯五四○疋。細布商標為蝶球，專運銷上海轉口港粵一帶。府綢坯專供二廠染整，第二廠在東門外，內分整理，漂煉，染色兩組。專事生產各種色布。日產二三千疋。目下因環境困難，處處逼上退守之路，不克作强度的全面生產。第三廠在東門白家橋，現擁有紗錠二萬零一百六十枚。布機四百十六台，目前開工，因原棉來源斷絕，祇開紗錠七千餘枚，布機二百台。其餘的錠子和織機，都閒着在睡覺，每周六日，日夜班工作，日產棉紗二〇支約八件。六〇支雙綫約二件，棉布五六百疋左右，三個廠員工人數約三千人左右。</p>
<p>民豐廠在小南門外，歷史悠久。現在擁有紗錠二萬八千五百枚。日出仙女紗20支約六十件。布機三百台。日出細布九百疋。全廠工人約一千六百餘人。紡紗方面，最近因原棉採購不易，一部份工作，只代美援花紗布聯營處紡32支細紗，為人作嫁，步履沉重，想挨過這時代的難關。</p>
<p>凡事成功，終靠人為，大成主持人劉國鈞，民豐江上達，兩位除發展本身業務外，在地方上也着實出了力，隱然是常州工商界領袖。</p>
<p>八十餘廠星羅棋布</p>
<p>此外星羅棋布，四散在城內城郊的中小型染織廠，總數八十餘家通成，恊源，民華，益豐等都算是個人翹楚。惟是時代的苦難，無一可幸免，紡織染業的今日，也正面暗着嚴重的危機。原棉來源阻塞，紗件枯渴，煤油，電力，燃料價格昂貴。成品銷路日促。範圍一狹，加以捐稅苛重，貨價雖然不斷的提高，可總是跟不上成本。………這許多一連串的議題，都是毫無情義的，萬分沉重的考騐。要求答案。去年八一九限價狂風雨的打擊，許多資本脆弱一些的廠，至今還未透過氣來。情形是相當的「慘」！「？」符號，相當的多，而且大！</p>
<p>農村耕織一幅新圖</p>
<p>常州產布，除上述幾十個大中小型工廠外還有一個散兵營產區，那便是農村織布。農村旣耕且織，數十年的孕育，便成了一幅嶄新的圖案。此一產區，以南門外湖塘橋為中心，周團幾十里地面，環而拱之。湖塘橋就成了總稱。</p>
<p>湖塘橋是個鄉村小市，在常州南門外，離城七里許，一條武宜路貫通南北，運河支流橫亙東西，水陸交通方便，附近農村點點，人烟稠密。歷來以農田不够分配，餘剩勞力，為生活，不得不找副業。—一些手工藝，梳箟，骨牌，紙牌等製作。而水磨扇骨，和竹刻扇骨，過去，湖塘橋是出名的。不過現在己衰落了。代興而起的便是織布。目下的情景，湖塘橋鎭上，固然是十室九戶，都是布機連着布機，織布跟着織布。湖塘橋周圍十餘里的無數個村莊上，也是挨門接戶的布機連着布機，織布跟着織布。阡陌相連。是一片桑麻麥苗，綠雲如海。村莊裏鷄鳴犬吠之外，那便是一片「唧唧復唧唧」的機梭聲。每一個農家起碼一部織機，多至三四部，男的女的，老的少的，懷着愉快的心情，勤務他的輕工業。村村戶戶，都懂透得經紗，熟練着漿紗，更熟練着織布，也憶得了染色，也同時能幹賣布買紗。更會計算着賺錢。若以每一個家，譬之工廠，那麼父母子女，公孫兒媳，都是廠主，但同時也是工人。他們間永遠沒有「勞資料紛」，也沒有「工廠管理」。更沒有「生活指數」。甘苦相共，利害一致，男的女的，老的少的，種田時種田，織布時織布。十餘年來，勤勞的結果，外造成湖塘僑出布的聲名，在地方造成美麗的耕織圖案。依次的鄉村新瓦房，處處建造起來，村村家給戶足，滿呈一片富庶氣象。最可　貴一點，是遊手好閑，喝茶賭博之徒，絕無僅有，勤儉興家，自成風氣。</p>
<p>生產合作三年有成</p>
<p>在鎭上，有一個第一棉布生產合作社，已成立了三年。理事長是一位極熱心社會事業的地方人士楊挺葆老先生。該社總社址在湖塘橋，相距十餘里外的嗚鳳南夏　蔣　等三處都設立分社。在農村織布的陣營中，他們為產為銷，加上了組織的力量。一般情形，是分組執管，每村設一組，有一組長，領導社員。每一組個位社員，自二個起至二十二個之多。一社員卽有一部織機。現在湖塘橋總社共有五十五個組，織布機在五百台以上，合南夏　鳴凰等分社，機數總在八九百台之間，機型一律是鐵木踏機，比較算是新型的，光就湖塘橋總社方面，每天出布在二三百疋之間。日需用紗六七件，出品大半是十磅半二六平布及輕重斜紋。和八磅半二三平布八磅的乙種二三平布。去年八一九限價後，為求容易推銷起見，大量織造麵粉袋布，上海　轉福興麵粉廠，本邑的成餘鼎等粉廠，都是特約的老主雇。該社對各個社員出品成色，絕對採嚴格標準化，尺幅長短闊狹，經緯疏密，都有規定，稍有差參，卽拒絕收受，所有出品白坯經染織廠漂染整理後，據評較品質均登上乘，與一般布廠出品較，有過之而無不及，以是信譽卓著。</p>
<p>合作社業務在產在銷，而難能可貴，純粹本服務性質，每天上午規定社員以布易紗。手續是有條不紊，潤利亦論着紗，現在指數是平布十七把八支斜紋廿五巴半，視銷路的旺衰，潤利亦隨之　减，事事講紗，毫不受通貨膨脹的影響，鄉下人做事，就是那麼老實，似平常而實不平常，至於湖塘橋一帶不屬於合作社的許許多織戶，那更各有千秋，織布門類，亦不單純，有專織綫呢有織條布，有織提花布，他們的成品，數量是沒有統計，只每天早晨大量擁到城來，西瀛里一條大街的早市，完全是紗布世界。活躍而生動。</p>
<p>在此，我應該提出這位熱心提倡，並見躬親領導這事業的楊挺葆老先生。</p>
<p>福音使者楊老挺葆</p>
<p>楊挺葆是當地人氏，已六十開外的長老，可是精神十分抖擻，平生做事有膽識，有魄力，有熱情，而且有辦法，從他事業上看，實是農村福音使者。在二十年前，他在當地倡導蠶桑，頗著成績，接着試辦機器戽水和電力灌漑，在廿六年前次第成功。現在常州湖塘棉以南三十里地面，大部是電力灌漑，這鏡頭相當的新颕而接近科學化農作，機器化耕種。楊老實為一個開風氣之先者。楊老憑數十年工作經騐，體會到人生哲學，討索到宇宙眞理，他很勇敢的獻身社會，不惜犧牲小我，義務的為農村大衆造福。他現領導着一個朝氣蓬勃的湖塘橋第一棉布生產合作社，以事實充分表現了「我為人人」的合作精神，他已博得羣衆的信仰，總社，和南夏歌，鳴鳳蔣灣分社，社員共八百餘，八百餘台布機，都由他領導，不英雄也是難能可貴。記者和楊老作一席談，楊老稱，如時局平靖，湖塘橋擴充到五千台布機，是毫無問題的。楊氏次一步的計劃，是想在目下這個狀况再求進步。要把脚踏鐵木機，完全改裝小型雷馬達鐵機，電力織布。動力就近利用戚　堰電廠的電很是便當，如果成功，那麼出品永遠不會愁淘汰，出品可以與精良的龍頭細布爭一日短長。如果成功，那末湖塘橋將會變成中國最大而最理想的布廠。相信這個理想，實現之期當不遙遠！楊老拈着他疏朗朗的幾縷鬍鬚，很興奮的申說着他的理想。筆者則認為新耕織圖廣大而前進的發展，是十分合乎中國數千年來「夫耕婦織」的傳統精神。這條輕工業的發展途徑，將修正「資本集中，產業集中」的惡性病象，而變為利益普沾，財散民聚的新路，很顯然的，農村新興的曙光是已在湖塘橋透露了</p>

<h3>國行逢高拋出六千餘兩　金市塲漲停第一聲</h3>
<p>晨開即升登漲限後市先俏後弛</p>
<p>昨晨金市走勢，一反前日疲莫能興之態，晨開每十兩五百六十萬元後，於各地經紀人一片買進聲中，在九時三十六七分左右，卽升達五百六十八萬元漲限，宣告停板。後以散戶逢高有吐，價乃回軟，一度盤旋於六百五十五萬至六百五十七萬間。至十一時半，價又轉昂，曾聞超出漲價五百六十八萬有賣出，惟無成交。同時央行方面開始委託大德成趁高拋售，價五百六十四萬元，市勢當落至五百六十四萬站定。</p>
<p>旋因央行方面拋售數鉅，若干經紀人多殺價搜求，一度喊低五百六十萬買進，無何成交，終因人心看好，逐漸回升至五百六十三萬五千元有成交，時在十一時五十八分，以迄午收，喊價盤旋，惟無成交。最後站定於五百六十四萬元，較開盤漲起四萬元。但塲外走勢，更見猛烈，當塲內五百六十八萬漲停時，卽站定高擋不稍回頭，近午曾一度抬高至五百七十一萬有買進。</p>
<p>綜計昨日金市，央行雖大量拋售，唯因吸納猛烈，未能壓小市面，自十一時半開始拋售後，迄至收盤前後半小時內，各經紀人爭相吸納，實際拋出六百三十二條，計六千三百二十兩，收回通貨達三十五億六千四百四十八萬元。</p>
<p>下午因按照規定仍須以當日頭寸現貨交易，各方頗多顧慮，故走勢呈先俏後弛，預計今晨銀根將轉平穩，漲風或可稍殺。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕午後塲內開五八九，一度升至五九〇萬，嗣後大戶拋空，央行更暗中支持，而和謠空氣傳說甚濃，盛况頓衰，市勢急遽回降，一路瀉至五五四萬收盤。</p>
<p>塲外開五八三，五八八，開後聞塲內市勢尙挺，人心見俏，散戶納胃重開，卽升至五八五，五九〇。嗣後一路回瀉，晚收為五六一，五六四。</p>
<p>美鈔晨開一一四〇〇元，一一五〇〇元，午收一一五〇〇元，一一六〇〇元。午後開一一七〇〇元，一一八〇〇元，晚收一一三〇〇元，一一四〇〇元。</p>
<h3>銀根鬆緊靡定　鈔荒無法解決　退票數額空前激增</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近來銀根鬆緊無常，現鈔空前短絀，票據滿天紛飛結果，本市票據交換所過去一週間，退票與交換票據之百分比率，亦創空前高額，其中尤以十四日之退票張數，共達四七五七張，退票金額一，一一八，九六七，四七〇元。已佔是日交換金額一五六，九三〇，五九〇，〇四二元百分之七一。</p>
<p>又十六日退票金額八二二，九七二，二一九元，亦佔是日交換金額一六七，〇二六，一八二，一五一元百分之九四。</p>
<p>又十五日之百分比，亦達百分之四六，十七日達百分之四七，十八日達百分之三八，十九日達百分之二六。</p>
<p>延長票交時間當局正調查中</p>
<p>關於票據交換所，於二十一日自動延長交換時間，一直延至二十二日營業時間以後一節，金管局頃已派員澈查。昨據該局負責人稱：關於此事之處理，刻正等待調查人員之報告中，一俟接得報告後，再決定處理方式。</p>
<p>彼並表示：交換票據，前曾規定每日至遲在午後一時半前卽需送達，此項延遲原因，據謂係由現鈔缺乏，支票本票過多所致，但此種情形，該所事前旣不設法制止，事後又不報告本局，不無疏忽之處，應受申斥處分，今後決不容許此種現象，再為發生。</p>
<h3>銀根走勢恍惚</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根，走勢頗為恍惚，惟最後仍以當局大量差出而維特鬆局。日拆初開，仍承隔日鬆勢，盤旋於六七十元間。惟供單仍多，日拆曾破入六十元關內，最低曾見四十五元。</p>
<p>下午四時後，因國行曾大量拋金，鬆勢稍歉，惟國庫大額支撥，外埠匯款續有流到，銀根骨子仍屬鬆濫，最後日拆在五十元光景。</p>
<p>國家行局庫，昨日空前差出七十三億九千餘萬元，洋商各行差出二十三億餘元，大交換各行差入三十七億五千餘萬元，小交換各行差入五十九億四千餘萬元。</p>
<h3>港匯平定</h3>
<p>港匯昨晨開千元四角二，前晚收四角四。金圓昨晨開千元四角六，前晚收四角四。港金昨晨開每港兩三一二元五，前晚收三一一元五角。美金電匯昨晨開五元二六。前晚收五元二五，美金期票昨晨開五元二三，前晚收五元二二。美鈔昨晨開五元二三，前晚收五二二。</p>
<h3>外匯銀行聯合會　開第四屆年會</h3>
<p>歡迎新會員普選舉常委</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市指定經營外匯銀行聯合會，昨日下午三時，假中行大厦四樓，舉行第四屆年會，歡迎新由國行核准辦理外匯之新會員十家入會。計美國商業，美國運通，中央合作金庫，國華，大陸，和成，中國實業，聯合，四川美豐，新華等十家。連該會原有會員十九家，合共會員已達廿九家。會議由中國銀行代表陳長桐主席，陳氏卽席報告過去一年來該會工作槪况，收支情形，金融動態。</p>
<p>繼卽選舉常務委員，結果中國，交通，東方匯理，麥加利，大通，浙江第一，中興，匯豐，金城，花旗，上海等十一家當選。</p>
<p>旋復由常務委員選出執行委員：中國，交能，花旗，上海，麥加利等五家。最後選出交通，花旗，兩家担任副主席，麥加利為司席。（根據會章，主席及名譽秘書係永久性，由中國及上海兩行分別担任。）</p>
<p>會中並通過致新任財長劉攻芸賀電，表示對今後穩定金融，發展貿易，決予全力之支持及合作會德豐六萬元買進，賣出未聞，其餘平庸。黃金公債晨開三五萬進，一路隨黃金俏勢升至三十六萬五，午收略回，為三五萬收盤，午後初做三十五萬，成交僅二兩，以後未見喊開。</p>
<h3>棉紗市勢上揚　布疋盤旋回升</h3>
<p>棉紗重告挺俏，市上銀根又見鬆動，兼以黃金報叩漲限，人心振作，本客進胃均為暢達，浮空抵補亦多。</p>
<p>晨初四二支藍鳳站住四百萬大關，卒以散多充斥，趁高迭來壓售，中途情况轉虛，一度衹至三百九十五萬元，臨收因浮空略有抵補，乃回昂至三百九十七萬元收市，較前挺二十四萬元。四〇支籃鳳漲二十萬元，三二支銀月，由二百七十萬元一路盤小至二百六十五萬五千元結局，終升十萬○五千元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬始以一百九十九萬元開出，旋竄出二百萬關，繼以做小至一百九十五萬元，最後復高至一百九十九萬之開盤價收市，軋漲十萬元，廠單與現貨軋平。二〇支雙馬挺九萬元，以一百八十九萬元午收，他若金城及天女等，初開均叩近大關，迄收始見回小，一六支以下各級亦跟蹤上揚。</p>
<p>布市高擋盤旋，各地去化仍狹，本街營業亦淡，人心難以樂觀，各布雖扯升半成强，但尙不够一天拆息，故塲內直銷甚少，僅檯面帮心思賣買。</p>
<p>龍頭細布因隔日纺建開售，市上籌碼增多，交易轉趨活潑，初開八萬三千五百元，最高達八萬六千五百元，近午曾做小至八萬〇七百元，終為八萬三千八百元，軋升三千八百元。喇叭童細布挺四千元。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰自七萬七千元開出後，卽低見七萬六千二百元，一度曾接近八萬關，午收復回落至七萬八千元，較前漲五千元，金運妙舞元嗶嘰最後做七萬七千元，終升五千元。此外當令貨，如府綢花布及漢士林等，廠盤均加碼半成至一成，餘布大多未動。</p>
<h3>食米止漲轉跌　麵粉上落不多　油市人心堅昂</h3>
<p>食米價格，昨南市塲平定，北市塲下跌，南米市塲開市亦見下跌，在中市突聞金價漲停板，致人心大為振動，貨主扳價，市終回升，收市與上日相平，最後略秀五百元。北市塲因上日漲得太多，稍告回低二千至二千五百元，白粳六萬二千五百元，特粳六萬六千元，二市到貨四七〇六石。</p>
<p>食油　漲勢無停止之勢，因銀根鬆，金價漲，人心堅昂，因銀根鬆，金價漲，人心堅昂，開市較堅，收市略軟，豆油終見軋升一萬四千元，收市價二十六萬八千，生菜油為二十四萬九千元，計升萬元。吉桶生油三十六萬五千元，上漲有二萬元之多，豆餅客帮無銷路，市甚疲。</p>
<p>麵粉　先漲後回，較前起落不多，初開聞金鈔激升，銀根甚為鬆動，北帮吸進甚力，且廠方拋出不多，人心看好，晨開各牌粉一律挺升千元，中途聞國行拋售，人心虛軟，市勢遂告不支，逐步下游。老車後市低至二萬二千二百元，兵船做二萬一千三百八十元。</p>
<p>雜糧　榮辱互見，黃豆先挺後回，生仁供不應求，再挺升一成，揚州提莊升達十九萬四千，芝蔴平定，紅糧微秀二千元，苞米靑　胃口淸淡，挫落千餘元。</p>
<h3>市塲散步　看台客</h3>
<p>發行量估計雖準後一分鐘就不對　小漲放任大漲打普遍浪潮又近了</p>
<p>現在跑跑市塲，只見一片惶惑躊躇的氣象。</p>
<p>金圓券的發行量，或說六千億，或說一萬億出關，這些估計，卽使正確，也只有一分鐘的時候。後一分鐘，又不知要增發若干億了。</p>
<p>實銷不暢的另一面，也就是來源不繼，假使兩面扯過，問題就在本地因素。紙幣汎濫，利息積纍，不漲也在漲了。但是眼睛看，耳朶聰，顰鼓聲聲，又是一番主意了。</p>
<p>收到了紙幣，睏不着，吃進了貨物，上心事。想來想去，左難右難，念頭還是轉到拿得動，藏得住的黃金，美鈔，和銀元。可是一旦風緊雨急，米煤關係更大。</p>
<p>米糧來自農村，煤斤來自北方，來不得也了，還是要吃要燒，儘可能，先替自己保險一番。一個月也好，三個月也好。於是而顯出了各業中，衆枯獨榮的現象。</p>
<p>衆枯獨榮是斷非常態，所以遲早之間，就要陸續看齊的。一個普遍性的浪潮，恐不出今後數天的。</p>
<p>昨天上午動一動，央行就用氣力。傍晚又動一動，姑看今天央行再有多少氣力？央行記住過去貝祖詒氏的秘訣，小漲時不是讓牠去，便是挑撥牠起勁漲。看準大家捲在漲風裏混淘淘了，就來一個突擊，猛地裏一記，把大家打得氣都透不過來。</p>
<p>邇來，央行常用結匯移轉證來挑逗漲風，而後就是當頭一棒。這種辦法，只有投機老手不會上當，普通人易被市塲空氣捉住，所以每當必上的。</p>
<p>也為了這個原故，投機老手每在衆醉獨醒時，套到發昏着的人們頭上。而發昏的多數是散戶，實力不够勁兒，所以一哄就竭，被高利息絆住；央行就乘勢一記，效力卽見。效力一見，老投機搶先補進，央行落後一步，不無吃虧。</p>
<h3>外股微升金價平庸</h3>

<h3>喬路巡迴表演　又賺美金廿一萬</h3>

<h3>女子籃球術</h3>
<p>— 戚公譯述</p>
<p>（二）（請捍圖十二）這個方式與第二個方式有連帶之關係，若採用三位進攻者向守衛者在一段區域內壓迫，則進攻者與後場之守衛佈陣有如上圖，正中衛則乃扼守中段區域注視着對方用高遠之遞送過後場來。更為嚴密之全部移動方式則為（圖十三），在後場是調正中衛站在中央界綫處來扼守，她要看球之動態而向左右流勸游擊，其他兩衛則在後場看管進攻者，正中鋒若認為在前場之進攻者是沒法阻攪對方之守衛將球送過後場來，則該正中衛立即退回來扼守着原來之位置。</p>
<p>那末，當擲界外球時又將怎樣來版應付之方式呢？這並不怎難，倘在東區擲界外球，接近該區域之守衛應推進到邊綫之前來看管，其他兩衛則固守着陣棧，等到擲界外球者巳將球擲入場中後，該守衛須立即退回扼守着原來之位置，其移動方式有如最初之圖示。</p>
<p>倘若對方進攻者在球籃底下擲界外球時，守衛者則應改換人釘人制，直到球已傳遞離出鑰匙孔眼圈之外後，守衛應迅卽恢復原來之區域防禦方式，所以守衛者要嘗嘗互相商討如何應付進攻者來作嚴巒之聯絡。</p>
<p>守衛者若得獲持球在手時，當然改守勞而為攻勞，在這種情況下，區域制是放棄的，守衛者當在場邊設法將球互相傳遞，務須將球送遞到前場之進攻者，圖十一，十二，十三是指出守衛者如何將球控在手裹與守衛者之傳遞路踐。</p>
<p>最徒的結論是移動區域防禦制是憑守衛球負之智能，位置純熱，有契與之合作，和敏捷之移動才能發生良好之效果，在人選方面，最優秀和最高的守衛應担任正中衛要職，最重要之技巧是要能夠作迅捷之移動。</p>
<p>區域防禦制並非在練習一天便生效果還要看球員之習慣和個性，這是必須要有速緊的，倘若球隊試用認為效果是良好的就不妨繼續去運用。</p>

<h3>葉觀雄力敗小徐　香港本年度　一場好綱球</h3>
<p>〔香港卅三日航訊〕本年的第一場公開草地網球單打準決饗，已於廿二日在塞滿了全場的觀眾面前打完了，小徐難然憂直落三（三比六，六比八，五比七）盤失敗在葉觀雄手上，但他的演出，我仍得承認那是他生平最得意的傑作，他而對着一個較年靑而手法無處不高出了一點的人物，在理是應敗的，但在失敗當中，他會發過十次「愛司」球，又曾打破了葉的「收功點」set－Paint凡六次多，雖則僅賽三盤，但共賽了一小時另二十五分鐘方完，這是比尋常賽足五盤的賽事還見緊張，由此可想像當時之精彩為如何了，經過這場演出後，我深信今年的單打錦標，十九又會終歸葉觀雄手上。</p>
<p>這天比賽徐潤培明知大敵當前江山易改，品性難移，他生性是手段要打落出纔漸見好轉的，是以不出山人所料，第一盤任他如何是葉觀雄先得發球權，在打成平手之後，便見　取勝一局第二局小徐乘發球之便，竟直勝四記，贏個淨勝之局，此後是葉得三對－領前，而後小徐進回二對三，結果共賽十七分鐘，葉觀雄先以六對三勝却第一盤，小徐是奪回第二，第五，第八等局，此局全是葉的優勢，曾有過三次「愛司」球，小徐在第四局，曾發過「雙錯誤球」一次。</p>
<p>第二盤</p>
<p>第二盤輪至小徐先發球，在兩度平手後，卒輸與葉，但至是小徐已水準漸露，竟速連兩局，初次以二對一領前，但被葉追回二對二平手後，卽無復有再佔先能力，追回三對三平手，又以三對五落後，最妙是第九局，葉難曾演兩次回擊立下殺手的手段，但小徐步步為營，不獨在平手後反佔先，且在二度平手後再恃一下「愛司」球，得回四對五局面，第十局葉會得四十對十五優勢，在人咸以為小徐再要輸四對六之時，突見小徐連救兩次盤點，再在第二次平手後又救回一次盤點，而卒進回個五對五平手，此後葉雖發嚇勝淨第十一局，但小徐又在節十二局再救回－次盤點，而再在如雷掌聲中，取得六對六平局，節十三局，小徐雖發山兩次「愛司」球，但氣力漸覺不繼，卒又被葉以七對六佔先，第十四局葉突發辣手，長短兼施，又得淨利，而以八比六再勝第二盤，此盤共賽四十三分鐘之久，直等於尋常賽兩雖的時間，此然小徐「愛司」三次，葉無「愛司」。</p>
<p>第三盤</p>
<p>第三盤小徐初似氣力不繼，第一局淨敗，第二局僅勝回一點，第三局取回兩點，卽連敗三局，不道目第四局起，小徐頓然恢復過來，常有絕妙之打出，竟－運直勝回四局，反以四對三第二次領前，此四局，雖強如葉觀雄，亦僅能取回四點而已，第七局葉且遞白券，可知當時小徐之聲威為何許，可惜好景不常，自被葉追回四對四平手後，小徐只能再勝一局，第三次以五比四領前，卽一蹶不振，速輸三局，被葉取得七對五勝利，由是小徐全局瓦解，計此盤共賽去二十四分鐘，至五時五十五分完場，此盤小徐「受司」七次，「雙誤」兩次，葉「愛司」四次，全賽葉未常開過一次「韆錯誤」球，可見葉之為藝，又已比前更進步也。</p>
<p>若以點數計算，則第一盤葉得廿九點，徐得二十點，第二盤葉得六十點，徐得五十點，最接近的是第三盤，葉得三十四點，徐亦得三十點，全盤是葉得一百廿三點，徐剛得一百點，洵洋洋大觀也。</p>
<h3>民主盃足球決賽　大夏今日戰螢光</h3>

<h3>「馬來亞明珠」　黃德福的光榮戰史</h3>
<p>〔星洲航訊〕能夠奪得世界羽球個人冠軍固然偉大，但是捨棄奪得此桂冠之一切可能性，而為馬來亞盡共最大之能力，使馬來亞奪得榮譽之湯姆斯杯更屬難能可貴，前者是美國的羽球怪傑費禮門，後者是馬來亞的黃德福。</p>
<p>黃德福在代表馬來亞隊於湯姆斯杯複賽及泱賽中，轉戰八場勝七場負一燦。</p>
<p>中流砥柱毫無疑義地，黃德福決不為他們人之榮譽而養精蓄銳，準備在全英羽球單打中將美國之費禮門擊敗，奪得象黴世界男子羽球單打的全英單打錦標，回憶馬美在蘇格蘭之複賽中，黃德福首先出陣，竭盡其能力將美國之第二號選手變台茲擊敗，黃德福這一勝，對奠定罵來亞羽球隊奪得錦標，有很大的關係，否則恐怕情形難於預料。再回憶馬丹決賽中黃德福再盡其最大責任，將稱雄歌洲之丹麥冠軍史加洛普擊敗，而順利地使馬來亞登上世界羽球王國之寶座。記得黃德德福於普列士頓在馬丹決饗，勝史加洛普氏時，今場的二千觀眾，不約而同的肅立為精疲力竭的，黃德福狂熟地鼓掌。總觀湯姆斯杯賽的全部過程中，沒有－位健兒得到如同黃德福所得到的相同讚譽，黃德福是馬來亞羽球隊中，百撼不動的岩石。在這塊中流砥柱般的岩石之前，美國與丹麥羽球除都先後向他低頭。</p>
<p>眞的，世界上任何一位愛好羽球的人們都同意，黃德福之為馬來亞盡力，使馬來亞奪得湯姆斯杯，要比他捨此而奪得世界羽球單打冠軍更偉大運動歷史現在，讓我們簡略介紹黃德福在羽球運動上的歷史。黃德福是被譽為「罵來亞明珠」的檳城華僑，年青時代他在檳城的英校念書，在球類運動一項上，他最先與棒球發生關係，但有時也踢踢足球，和游泳，也參加童子軍活動。</p>
<p>一直到十五歲那年，他才開始打羽球，參加檳城之朝陽羽球會，初時黃德福對羽球似無特別興趣，也亳無特色，甚至有一次因為打來退步，他還被降下一組。</p>
<p>一九三七年：是黃德福今天成名的「錦換年」，在這一年中黃脫離朝陽羽球會而參加檳城頗負威名之林士鐸羽球會，魷在這一年中，黃德福開始在檳城露頭角，在同年舉行的全檳羽球公開賽中，黃德福一關過－關，到半複賽時，才遭淘汰</p>
<p>翌年（一九三八年）黃德福好像改變策略，放棄爭奪檳城單打的冠軍，而與另一名陳很豐者合作雙打，在雙打壇上，黃德福果然償其宿願，在全羽球公開賽中，黃德福與陳根豐合作，包辦三屆雙打冠軍，也一次奪得全馬的雙打冠軍。</p>
<p>一番苦練正如許許多在事業上獲得最後成功的名人一樣，黃德福是先耕耘才有今天的收穫，黃德福在羽球運動上，費盡一番苦心，確確實實地苦練過幾年，黃德福經過四名羽球指導的敎導，每次至少花半小時的時間練習各種擊拍攔截的基本姿勢。</p>
<p>作為一位運動員，黃德福對攝生方面，嚴格地遵守生理衛生學，他在比賽前須有充份的睡眠，在運動前幾天，他戒絕有刺激性的食物，甚至對一般罵來亞所嗜好的咖啡食物，他也嚴戒，他的理由說：「如果我們的肚子發燒，一定打不出好球」。</p>
<p>在技術上黃德福並未曾達到爐火純靑的地步，你還沒有閃電式的擊球手怯，他的主要武器是應付高球，有時的網前輕放，準備及敏捷的步伐。除此外，黃德福還有一個特點，就是他的眼光故銳，能於緊張之球賽中，測探對手的虛實，黃德福就利用送一特長，置丹麥之史加洛普於無用武之地。他於馬丹決賽中，會戰史加洛普時，測出史加洛普弱點後，在迅速中改變攻打路綫。由進攻史加洛普之反手而猛壓其順手方向。此外，在運動精神上，黃德福有一沉着應付與堅毅不拔之作戰精神。在馬時，黃德福是以此精神向黃炳順取勝的。在蘇格蘭及普列士頓的二次球賽中，黃德福的這種運動精神又得一證明，許多人都認為黃德福之對費禮門（美），曼台茲（美），菲爾斯培（丹）及史加洛普各球賽中有因氣竭盡力而倒地之可能，但是事實之表現相反，黃德福不但使費禮門（美）陷入非力戰不可取勝之境地，而且還在氣力減少之場面下先後向曼台茲，菲爾斯培，史加洛普取勝。黃德福在遺種氣力漸盡的場面下，儘靠其信心作戰，黃德福的在馬來亞歷次公開賽的成績表現是馬來亞羽球史上之特出者。</p>
<p>一九三入年：檳城乙組單打冠軍，乙組混合雙打冠軍，儐城公開男子雙打冠軍。首次代表檳城，參加馬來亞埠際賽。又同年，檳城公開單打及雙打冠軍。罵來亞混合雙打冠軍。</p>
<p>一九四零年：檳城單打冠軍。男子雙打及混合雙打亞軍。全馬男子單打並軍（冠軍為黃炳順），馬來亞雙打冠軍，混合雙打亞軍。</p>
<p>一九四一年：檳城單雙打亞軍。</p>
<p>一九四七年：馬來亞雙打冠軍，儐城三料冠軍</p>
<p>一九四八年：馬來亞單雙打冠軍。檳城混合雙打冠軍。檳城單打及雙打亞軍。（單打冠軍為羅德福。）一九四九年：國際羽球單打亞軍（冠軍美國費禮門），變打冠軍。代表馬來亞參加湯姆斯杯賽勝利獲得金章。</p>

<h3>血的催眠</h3>
<p>— 劉隨</p>
<p>大兵之後，必有凶年，歷史上任何一個朝代都恐懼兵　，同時更恐懼繼兵　而來到的疫癘和饑饉，在中國，這一個歷史的敎訓，尤其應該使我們這一代刻骨銘心的。但是，依照眼前的許多事實佐證，幾十年來留在國土上的殷紅鮮血，非但沒有使大家培育品萇弘化碧後的警覺，恰巧相反，絕對多數的人却倒在血腥中瘋狂起來。是非，恩怨，一切都取決於流血，在最大的疫癘和饑饉還未落到我們頭上之前，我們相互間巳先以血來做彼此的祭禮了。上一代人所流的血，反倒成爲我們這一代人的催眠劑，這難道眞是時代的悲劇？</p>

<h3>此例一開</h3>
<p>— 徐卓之</p>
<p>聽說，客飯要以米價作標準了，分爲三級：二升五合，二升，以及一升三合。我，因爲除禮拜天外，每天中午必須從公司裏出來，到附近飯館裏吃客飯，一年到頭，風雨無阻；所以對於這個消息，聽了特別吃驚。</p>
<p>自然，飯館老闆們都是很精明的，即使是靑菜裏拌上十幾根肉絲也一定會毫不留情地定爲「甲級」客飯。這還在其次。妙的是，米價既時刻可能有上漲，尤其是在中午市塲行情報出的時候，則吃到一半忽然漲價，致口袋裏帶的錢不够付賬的故事，眞的要實現了。</p>
<p>其實，以米作標準，也並不是頂穩妥的。因爲客飯只不過包括兩小碗白飯，此外，還有一盆菜，和一碗「太平洋湯」的。湯最好以醬油市價作標準，姑且不論。這菜，顯然是應該以肉之類的東西爲標準，例如分爲三級：一斤肉，八兩肉，四兩肉等等。如此一算，就複雜了，而且似乎非編一個每天調整的「客飯指數」不可。</p>
<p>吃客飯人究竟不是最多，不比戶口米，所以不論如何算怯，也都罷了。只是此例一開，又難保不擊起效尤，如理髮，洗衣，電車公共汽車等等，也可以起而要求以當天米價計算，則金圓券爲惟一合法本位幣的　　法令，又一次地要大受打擊了。</p>
<p>例是不可以輕易開的；因爲一開了例，以後就歎於縮腳了。</p>

<h3>漢墓在紹興</h3>
<p>— 觀周</p>
<p>日前報載常州發現漢墓，居民往觀者絡繹不絕，轟動一時。但這在紹興東南山間的居民，是司空見慣，毫不以爲奇的。</p>
<p>遠在民國廿五年三月間，紹興就有漢墓發見。筆者在廿九年本報上，曾寫過「紹興的漢塚」一文，記述其事。紹興東南地區多小山，如南池·平水·上灶等地，漢墓特多，先後出土的，不下二三千處，大小不一。小墓形如大卡車，殉葬物則在車頭處，鄉人發掘，對於這一部份，特別小心，以免鋤頭掘碎磁器等物；大墓有二三室（常州發見者想爲大墓），其室大都被泥土淤塞，開掘頗費工程。</p>
<p>八一三後，掘古墳的風氣大盛，鄉人稱爲「淘古墳」，每墳必有所穫。於是上海的古董商，就經常派員駐紮在鄉間，以賤價搜買出土物，可是在鄉人看來，仍算有利可圖，認爲生財之道，於是農閒就以此爲副業。後來縣政府出示不禁止，違者拘押，這一椿偷掘的工作，就在夜間舉行，作者曾親見他們在夜間興高彩烈地在古墓中淘金。</p>
<p>出土古物有陶器·銅器·鐵器等，玉器不多，好在價賤，我也買了好些，迄今保存。陶器如面盆（盆邊有突出的生肖像）·花盆·水盂·人像等，形狀與目下的陶器不同；銅器最値錢，尤以銅鏡爲古董商所最喜買，因埋土中多年，其色已黑，好像烏金，大的直徑四五寸，後面也有生肖。（此物本埠博物院路的博物館中，亦有保存）。</p>
<p>墓磚極大而笨重，間或邊上有字，但爲數不多，無宇者一文不値，有字者則略値若干，如，一邊爲嘉平三年，一邊爲某某民造。其他如凰鳳元年·黄龍元年·赤烏·太康·永和等都有，我在歷代大事年表上查閱，多爲三國時代及三國前後的帝王年號。（如筆者所有的鳳凰元年磚石一塊，查係孫權年號）。墓內從沒有發見過骷髏，棺木更不必談，大概因爲年深月久，其人與木皆已朽矣。</p>
<p>漢晋古墓，何以在紹興發現最多呢？據說，因爲三國時會稽文物鼎盛，文人雅士如王羲之之流，相繼入越卜居，故羊士諤有「山陰道上桂花初，王謝風流滿晋吳」之句。</p>
<h3>如此保國民小學（油畫）</h3>
<p>— 俞雲階</p>
<p>（「敎育第一」，「建國第一」，口號是很好聽的，但我們所看見的，却只是兩間東倒西歪的屋子，一根七彎八曲的旗桿，和二三十個面黄肌瘦的可憐的學生。）</p>
<h3>艾森豪威爾與「重慶」艦</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>「重慶號」完了。如此下塲，實在令人惋惜。現在再來回想它在第二次大戰中光榮的戰績，眞是不堪回首！</p>
<p>許多人在追溯它和義國軍艦英勇作戰的史跡，說它曾有「銀光鬼」的稱號，說它後來曾做英王的座體，……却不知這次聯合國最高統帥們，更曾在這一艘輕巡洋艦上，身先士卒，親冒敵人的砲火，表現了無比的沉着和果敢。</p>
<p>一九四三年六月六日，正是西西里登陸戰即將開始的時候，那時的「重慶號」還叫做「震旦」。那天下午，「震旦」號的船員和海軍們突然緊張起來，因爲艦上突然來了幾位貴賓，這艘軍艦顯然要祖任一項重要的任務了。什麼任務呢？大家不知道。</p>
<p>這幾位貴賓中最重要的兩位是：盟軍最高統帥艾森豪威爾上將（那時還祗有四星），和那時的盟軍海軍總司令克銀漢上將。</p>
<p>六月七日破曉五時，艦長艾格紐奉命向全艦廣播說：「海空軍即將進攻西西里島南端的潘脫來里亞軍港，參加這次戰役的，有巡洋艦四艘，驅逐艦八艘，本艦即將前往觀戰」。克銀漢上將怒吼了：我們偏不觀戰。我來負責！」</p>
<p>他立刻向副官們發出了幾項命令，「震且」號立刻把「觀戰」的種種準備全部改變，準備「參戰」。</p>
<p>上午十點半，抵達劉的地潘港。「震且」號加緊速率，領導了全體參戰的軍艦，一馬當先，可是岸上的砲火却異樣的沉默。「震旦」號回艦再以曲綫方向對海岸前進，對方却也不開砲。一轉眼間，但見英式俯衝轟炸機大批出現，對海岸防禦陣地下彈如雨，烟陣起時，「震且」號艦身一震，九尊大砲齊發。同時，艦身更徐徐前進，配合了其他軍艦，分別抵達各艦攻擊目襟的正面。砲聲連續不斷，「震且」的大砲命中了沿岸的防波堤，再向左二百碼處發砲，粉碎了潘港的船塢。</p>
<p>砲轟十五分鐘後，驅逐艦向前急進至離岸二千碼的地方。岸上防軍的砲火也活躍起來了，離「震且」號右舷三百碼處海面，也落下了砲彈。</p>
<p>岸上又是陣陣巨砲，艾森豪威爾將軍突然覺得船身又一巨震，心裏想這次可是中彈了罷。但一定神時，却知道原來是「震且」號又開了一次排砲。</p>
<p>艾森豪威爾在船上計算，照這樣打一下，再加五天空軍轟炸，潘港守軍的士氣大概就吃不消了，於是便決定：六月十一日午刻向潘港總攻。</p>
<p>到正午，「震且」艦全勝而歸，毫無死傷，唯一的損失，祗是克銀漢上將胸襟上的勳章受震，掉到了海裏。</p>
<p>但是，到了六月十一日，「震旦」艦却並沒有參加總攻，因爲在那天午刻，克銀漢上將接到了一個電報。他把這個電報送給艾森豪威爾時，艾帥笑了。那電文是：「潘脫來里亞港已降。」</p>

<h3>Increasing the Number of Peace Talk Representatives: Decision Expected at Today's First Political Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>President He Scheduled to Fly to Guangzhou Next Week to Handle the Handover</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The He Yingqin new cabinet is scheduled to hold its first political affairs meeting at the Presidential Palace at 10:00 AM on the 24th. There are a total of seventeen members, of which, with the exception of Fu Bingchang in the Soviet Union, Hang Liwu and Mo Dehui in Taiwan, Zhang Qun in Sichuan, and Dai Kuisheng in Guangzhou, the rest can all gather in Nanjing on the 24th. The number is sufficient for a quorum, and a formal meeting can be held. At the meeting, He Yingqin will first deliver a speech, explaining the current situation and inviting all cabinet members to encourage each other to overcome the crisis. They will also discuss agenda items, primarily the number and selection of peace talk representatives, and preliminary planning for the departure date. They will also broadly exchange opinions on policy directions. He also scheduled to fly to Guangzhou with Huang Shaogu next week after the new cabinet is officially formed, to conduct a handover with Sun's cabinet. The seal of the Executive Yuan, which Sun's cabinet took to Guangzhou, will also be brought back to Nanjing for use on this trip.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Regarding the dispatch of additional peace talk representatives, He Yingqin invited Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Weng Wenhao, and others at 4:00 PM on the 23rd for preliminary discussions. It is rumored that in terms of personnel, in addition to the existing Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, and Huang Shaozi, Zhang Shizhao and Mo Dehui were also proposed for the remaining slots. In terms of numbers, it is planned to increase the number from five to six, but no decisions have been made yet. The opinions of the majority of cabinet members will be broadly solicited at the political affairs meeting on the 24th to make a final decision. He also immediately visited the Acting President that evening to report everything.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] It is reported that Zhang Shizhao has agreed to serve as a representative of the government's peace talk delegation. This was decided on the 23rd. He Yingqin spoke to Zhang via long-distance telephone in the evening and obtained Zhang's consent.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Li Acting President’s advisor Gan Jiehou, told United Press reporters today that as soon as the government appoints representatives, peace talks can begin with the Communist side. The number of our peace talk representatives and the date of the peace talks can all be decided by the government. The location of the peace talks will be chosen by the Communist side.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Unconfirmed reports here say that both the Nationalists and the Communists hope to announce the list of peace talk representatives before the end of the month. Authoritative sources further stated that the format of the peace talks will be similar to the Nationalists-Communists peace talks held in Chongqing on October 10, 1945. If both parties can negotiate based on Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions, representatives of third parties can also participate in the peace talks.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] According to sources close to Acting President Li, the government's attitude towards peace has not changed due to recent political and military developments. He vehemently refuted the claim that frequent troop movements by the Communist army on the north bank of the Yangtze River will affect the prospects for peace. He said that this type of military action was expected because "We are also preparing for war to seek peace. We certainly cannot expect the Communist army not to make military deployments."</p>
<h3>CCP Broadcasts on Peace Talks, Indicates the Time is Increasingly Urgent</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the Shaanxi-North CCP radio station broadcasted stating, regarding the peace talks, that "the time for peace talks is now increasingly approaching." This indicates that the Communist Party still wants to hold negotiations with the current government. At the same time, the He Yingqin new cabinet of the government has been formed, revealing that the peace delegation is expected to depart for Beiping in early April. This can be seen as an important opportunity in the current situation. The Communist Party believes that the date of the peace talks is near. Once the peace talks begin, it will be clear whether the government will continue the war or accept and implement the Communist Party's eight peace conditions. This reflects that the Communist Party will still insist on the eight points as the basic principles of its negotiations. Yesterday, the CCP broadcast commented on the He Yingqin cabinet, saying that He announced at a reception at the Supervisory Yuan in Nanjing on the 18th that his cabinet was a peace cabinet, but whether He Yingqin's judgment conforms to the facts cannot be verified from each unit of his cabinet, nor can it be verified from his declaration. Therefore, it is not known what role the Nanjing government will play in this peace negotiation. In addition, the CCP made extremely fierce criticisms of the United States and President Chiang in this broadcast, saying that the United States continues to aid and instigate war.</p>

<h3>Xu Kan, Zhang Zhaoyuan, and Sun Zhiping, Supervisory Committee Members Request Simultaneous Impeachment, For Seeking Personal Gain and Malfeasance in Sun Ke's Expenditure of National Funds</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] In the case of Sun Ke's reckless expenditure of huge amounts of national funds under the name of confidential expenses, Supervisory Committee member Hu Wenhui conducted further investigations and recently filed impeachment cases against former Minister of Finance Xu Kan and former Director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office Zhang Zhaoyuan, which will be submitted for review on the 24th. The impeachment document submitted by Committee member Hu stated: "Former Minister of Finance Xu Kan, former Director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Committee Zhang Zhaoyuan, and Sun Zhiping, director of the government shares of the China Industrial Bank, etc., illegally received 110 million yuan in confidential expenses from Executive Yuan President Sun Ke, colluded with each other, befriended wealthy families, abused their powers, and sought personal gain and engaged in malfeasance. They should be impeached together with the case of Executive Yuan President Sun Ke's reckless expenditure of huge amounts of national funds and submitted to the President for strict punishment to rectify the law and discipline and correct official misconduct." According to reliable sources, the facts of Xu Kan, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Sun Zhiping, and others violating the law and engaging in malfeasance are that the Central Bank, on February 10, paid 110 million yuan in confidential expenses to Executive Yuan President Sun Ke pursuant to an order from the Ministry of Finance. On February 15, Luo Zongwen, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, issued a temporary receipt. The Central Bank then submitted a request to the Executive Yuan on February 23 to exchange for a formal receipt. It was not until March 2 that the Ministry of Finance received a formal receipt dated February 10 signed by Zhang Zhaoyuan and Sun Zhiping. Zhang Zhaoyuan received 100 million yuan, and Sun Zhiping received 10 million yuan. According to the provisions of the National Treasury Law, this payment can only be represented by Executive Yuan staff. Zhang Zhaoyuan and Sun Zhiping are not Executive Yuan staff, but they issued a receipt for a huge amount of national funds and even backdated the date, which is obviously malfeasance. Minister of Finance Xu Kan is also difficult to absolve of responsibility.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Committee of the Supervisory Yuan held a meeting at 7:00 PM on the 23rd.

<h3>Communist Army Threatens to Attack Xinxiang, Now Gradually Strengthening the Outer Perimeter Blockade, National Army Expresses Coexistence with the New City</h3>
<p>[Our Xinxiang Dispatch, 23rd] The Communist army is now gradually strengthening the blockade of the outer perimeter of Xinxiang and building fortifications in the Baliying and Tangzhuang areas near the airport to threaten air transport. The National Army is bombarding with heavy artillery on a daily basis. The Communist army has also completed a new highway about three zhang wide between Hebei and Henan and threatened that the Northeast Communist army will soon move south to attack Xinxiang. According to military intelligence, it has been determined that the large number of Communist troops who crossed the river through Dianyang and Changyuan on the 19th are from Nie Rongzhen's troops, mostly new recruits, and equipped with some supplies, and may move south along the Longhai Railway. In addition, the National Army's Independent 9th Division Wang Sanzhu's troops swept the Yanfeng area on the 2nd. A spokesman for the Sui District here recently issued a statement on the situation in Xinxiang, saying that some people are now pessimistic about the environment due to the Communist army's propaganda offensive. The military is also aware of this real problem, but we adhere to a belief that no matter how the situation deteriorates, we swear to coexist with Xinxiang. If the Communist army invades, we will fight them to the end. The Sui District recently convened officers below the division commander to swear an oath to fight to the end and be loyal to their duties. The Xinxiang National Army is now strengthening its fortifications.</p>
<h3>Communist Army on the Opposite Bank of Jiaoshan: Probing Attack Failed</h3>

In this battle, more than 200 Communist soldiers were killed or wounded.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 23rd] At Jiuweigang, west of Baweigang, a small number of Communist troops advanced to the riverside on the morning of the 23rd and retreated north after being bombed by the garrison. In addition, the Huangtiangang Inspection Station seized a ship smuggling Western medicines and machine oil, and two crew members were sent to the county for interrogation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] At 4:00 PM on the 23rd, near Nantianshenggang, Jingjiang, a wooden raft carrying more than 20 people attempted to smuggle across to the south bank and was sunk by the Jiangyin Fortress artillery.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Sells Gold and Silver at High Prices, Supervisory Committee Members to Make Policy Corrections, Tang Honglie and Others Return to Nanjing to Report on the Investigation in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Supervisory Committee members Tang Honglie and Hu Wenhui, who went to Shanghai to investigate the Central Bank's high-priced sale of gold and silver, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 23rd. After getting off the train, they immediately visited President Yu to report on the investigation in Shanghai and provided an analysis and explanation of the case at the morning court meeting. They will propose a policy correction to the Central Bank's current policy of selling gold and silver. In addition, when the Central Bank sold gold and silver in Shanghai, the pricing was determined by the Stabilization Fund, which also had representatives from the Ministry of Audit participating, but they were not responsible for determining the price. Tang and Hu believe that it seems necessary to withdraw the representatives. They visited President Yu on the morning of the 23rd and explained this intention, and Yu has indicated that he will withdraw the Ministry of Audit representatives from the committee.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The government's policy of selling gold and silver in Shanghai has now become the object of speculation by speculators. They are causing trouble and manipulating the situation, which has obviously defeated the government's policy of selling gold and silver. This policy is indeed a temporary expedient, but it is by no means a permanent solution. To seek economic stability, a fundamental plan must be made, and the policy of selling gold and silver, which is sufficient to promote speculation, must be corrected in time. Supervisory Committee members Tang Honglie and Hu Wenhui made the above conclusions after returning from Shanghai to investigate the National Bank's sale of gold and silver and reporting on the investigation process at the Supervisory Yuan on the 23rd. Tang analyzed the origin of the National Bank's policy of selling gold and silver when reporting at the court meeting on the 23rd, saying that when Sun's cabinet was first established, it was planned to link the three parts of finance, finance, and trade into one in order to increase fiscal revenue and reduce issuance. However, for various reasons, the scheduled plan could not be achieved. The Central Bank, acting as the national treasury, paid out huge sums of money from February 1 to 28 and from March 1 to 19 pursuant to orders from the Ministry of Finance, part of which was for political expenses and another part for temporary expenses. In addition to what has already been arranged and paid out, the unpaid amount is as high as 40 billion yuan. In addition, prices are rising daily, the amount of money is insufficient, and the shortage of banknotes is becoming increasingly serious. In order to take countermeasures, the Central Bank implemented the sale of gold and silver for three purposes: (1) to regulate finance, (2) to combat speculation, (3) to ease rising prices. At that time, the amount of gold thrown out reached more than 40,000 taels. The amount of silver dollars thrown out on the 18th and 19th reached more than 330,000. The methods of selling were divided into two types: explicit distribution and secret sale. Explicit distribution was distributed to various silver shops, and secret sale was entrusted to the Bank of Communications to be sold through brokers. Although prices were stable for one or two days at that time, they then fluctuated sharply again, and the severity of the banknote shortage was not reduced at all. Later, a considerable amount of US dollars was thrown out again, which only had a few days of effect. Then Tang explained the four common views of the two after the investigation: (1) Today, military and political expenses are huge, and the phenomenon of unbalanced income and expenditure is deepening day by day. Currency inflation is also increasing. Within a month, income and expenditure often increase several times, and the situation is very serious. (2) Selling gold and silver can only be effective for three to five days. After this, prices will rise sharply again. Not only can it not stabilize prices, but it also stimulates prices. The technology of selling is highly questionable, and the national gold and silver wealth is limited. The use of limited gold and silver for speculators' speculation cannot be effective forever and should be carefully considered. The reason why such a speculative phenomenon has formed in Shanghai, Tang analyzed, is nothing more than five points: A. Everyone has no confidence in the gold yuan coupon, so they take the gold yuan coupon as much as possible to exchange for gold, silver, and US dollars, and gold, silver, and US dollars have become the object of speculation. B. Speculators in Shanghai are keen, have deep observations, and have sophisticated methods. The methods set by the government cannot escape the hands of these cunning people. C. There are too many military and political agencies in Shanghai, and military and public funds often participate in speculation. D. Banks and money shops in Shanghai collude with each other and are unified, all targeting the government and seeking profits. E. According to various signs, it is obvious that wealthy capital and special forces are causing trouble. With the above five reasons, the policy of selling gold and silver not only cannot combat speculation, but also promotes speculation, and the policy itself may also have problems. On the 38th, the price of silver dollars on the Shanghai market was more than 7,000 yuan. The Central Bank sold it at 7,000 yuan, which was not higher than the market price. However, at that time, the silver dollars in various places outside of Shanghai were mostly below 7,000 yuan. Influenced by Shanghai and the Central Bank selling at 7,000 yuan, they rose sharply and caused price fluctuations. The Central Bank cannot shirk its responsibility for negligence. People from the Central Bank have expressed that this was due to a lack of consideration. When selling, it mostly passes through the hands of brokers. They often collect it in small amounts and then sell it in large amounts. Whether wealthy families are causing trouble should be closely watched. Tang said in conclusion: The policy of selling gold and silver is not a fundamental plan, and efforts should be made from the root to improve the current economy.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Anhui and Hubei Moves South Section by Section, Qianshan is Occupied and Anqing is Threatened, Garrison Troops in Xishui Also Withdraw to the Suburbs</h3>
<p>[Our Anqing Dispatch, 23rd] According to a communique from the Ministry of National Defense today, the 6th and 7th Columns of the Communist Army have fled south from Hefei to the vicinity of Chaoxian.

Barr did not propose any U.S. aid to China plan, but he suggested that even if the political situation in China evolves to the point that the entire country is engulfed in an iron curtain, the United States should closely monitor the development of the situation in China.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Change of Foreign Minister and Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>After the announcement of the list of cabinet members of the He Cabinet, people felt that the new cabinet, in addition to the general feeling that the talents and qualifications were slightly insufficient, could not but be said to have made considerable progress. In any case, this seems to be a new atmosphere compared to the previous two cabinets. The most eye-catching thing is the return of Ambassador Chuan Bingchang, the ambassador to the Soviet Union, to take over the position of Foreign Minister. According to general opinion, Chuan has been stationed in Moscow for five or six years, and may have a clearer understanding of the Soviet political situation and its attitude towards China. Now that he has returned to the country to take over as Foreign Minister, China's foreign policy may undergo drastic changes. Therefore, in the past few days, foreign news agencies, which have always been able to make something out of nothing, have once again spread news about Chuan's appointment as Foreign Minister, saying that China's foreign policy will abandon the Washington line and take the Moscow line, or that there has been a great division within the Kuomintang over the choice of Foreign Minister. Some telegrams even said that Fu's appointment as Foreign Minister was the result of Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi's efforts to fight for it. Based on our common sense, the wide spread of these rumors raises serious doubts about how much factual basis there is, and it is not worthy of a knowing smile. The foreign policy of any country has its immovable foundation, and it will not change its course due to personnel changes. We would like to take this opportunity to review our country's foreign policy with the whole country.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, the Chinese people have been accustomed to self-respect and arrogance, and have always called China the world, without any modern international concept. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty, after China's doors were opened, that they realized that there were many countries in the world besides China; but they still regarded foreign countries as barbarians, unwilling to treat them as equals, unwilling to study the world situation, and even more unaware of what diplomacy was, only knowing that handling foreign affairs was a new policy. The ignorant relatives of the emperor and the vulgar ministers made China's diplomatic history full of shame and stains, making it unbearable to read. Even after the birth of the Republic of China, the vigorous May Fourth Movement made the general youth deeply aware of the importance of "people's diplomacy", but they were poisoned by the stale concept of "weak countries have no diplomacy". In the past two or thirty years, our country has not had brilliant achievements in diplomacy.</p>
<p>We study the truth of the matter, not because there are no diplomats in the country, but because the people who handle diplomacy are misled again and again by some wrong ideas. Let's take a well-known example: For example, the well-known "using barbarians to control barbarians". In the use of diplomacy, it is indeed one of the diplomatic means, but it must have some prerequisites when using it. If you can't stand on your own feet and vainly try to use the means of "using barbarians to control barbarians", the result will inevitably be a tragedy of "rejecting the tiger at the front door and letting the wolf in at the back door". There are many examples in China's diplomatic history. We must accept the lessons of history and have a thorough understanding. In fact, when China handles diplomacy, we believe that only the six characters of "speaking truthfully, acting sincerely" should be our treasure. To put it more succinctly, it is just "sincerity". "Sincerity is the beginning and end of things; without sincerity, there is nothing". In the world, even in ordinary daily life and social interactions, there should be no lack of "sincerity". Can it be said that means can be used between countries and that sincerity and trustworthiness can be abandoned? Or do you think that the world is changing rapidly and the wind of maneuvering is prevailing? Although China is nominally a great country, it is weak and powerless. If you talk about sincerity and trustworthiness, wouldn't you worry about being deceived? However, it is not known that only when the national strength is insufficient, should we be more determined not to change our sincerity and trustworthiness. Only sincerity can investigate things, move people, and receive the effect of getting more help. It is by no means something that those who change their minds can dream of getting unexpected gains.</p>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese War, the foreign policy of the National Government has consistently adopted the principle of independence and autonomy. We are grateful for the friendship and assistance of any country; and we cannot tolerate the deliberate aggression and humiliation of any country. The United States has no territorial ambitions towards China, and its years of assistance are nothing more than hoping that China can become an independent, democratic, and strong country to maintain peace in East Asia after the war. The Chinese people are happy to accept the friendship of the United States for this reason, and there is no so-called "pro-American", let alone falling into the arms of the United States. However, some people have excessive expectations of the United States in the past, but they do not reflect on themselves. Once they feel that American aid is not as much as we hoped, they turn around and curse the United States, and even say that if the United States does not strengthen its assistance, they will turn to "pro-Soviet", which is very strange. Some foreign journalists do not realize that this is just the prejudice and fantasy of a few people, so once they see Ambassador Chuan being transferred to be the Foreign Minister, they become neurotic and speculate that this is a sign of a change in China's foreign policy. We think not.</p>
<p>First, it is still under consideration whether Ambassador Chuan is willing to return to the country to take over as Foreign Minister. Even if Ambassador Chuan agrees and returns to the country to take office, it cannot be said that the ambassador to the Soviet Union must be "pro-Soviet" and must take the Moscow line. Take Mr. Bohlen as an example. He is today a strong advocate of anti-Sovietism in the United States, but he once served as the Ambassador to the Soviet Union. What's more, it is questionable how many times Ambassador Chuan has met Stalin and Molotov in the Soviet Union for several years, and how the Soviet Union values him. Even if he wants to be "pro-Soviet", it is not so easy.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of China's current foreign policy, it still takes an independent and autonomous stand and takes the middle line. On the one hand, it welcomes US economic and military assistance, but on the other hand, it still has a 30-year Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the Soviet Union. The friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union are no less than those between China and the United States. If it is true that China's foreign policy will take the Moscow line as rumored, but what kind of benefits will it have? This is a serious question. This kind of wavering and lack of a central idea will plunge China into a dangerous abyss.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of the international situation, since the content of the Atlantic Treaty was announced, the Cold War between the East and the West has become more and more intense, but it is believed that it will not turn into a hot war for a while. China is a major country in the Pacific. As the Pacific Treaty is about to be brewed, China must be cautious in our actions, always maintain our attitude of opposing totalitarian aggression, so that the world's democratic countries can strengthen their front, in order to show that the world's war fire is not allowed to be reignited by totalitarian aggressive countries, so that those who play with fire can know what to be afraid of, and a new international war may be avoided. At a time when more than 50 US senators (accounting for more than half of the total) have signed a request to strengthen aid to China, it is said that the government will instead change its course and take the Moscow line. Not to mention that the He Cabinet is not so stupid, even if the He Cabinet wants to do so, the people may not be willing to give up.</p>

<h3>Four Soldiers Executed by Shooting in the Case of Gang Rape of the Wife of the Regiment Commander in Hankou; Three Other Criminals Transferred to the Court for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 23rd] The much-publicized case of the gang rape of the wife of the regiment commander by six people in Wuhan suddenly announced a partial judgment on the 23rd. The four main criminals with military status, Cui Bowen, Zeng Xuanmin, Ling Zhi, and Shi Pan, were tied to the execution ground at 5:00 pm on the 23rd and executed by shooting. The remaining accomplices, Cha Dajun, Yuan Shangzhi, and the worker Chen Songlian, who destroyed the evidence, were transferred to the court for investigation because they had no military status. Previously, after the case was tried by the military judicial organs here, it was repeatedly submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for review. Later, because the ministry returned it for retrial and sent You Xiongjun, deputy director of the Military Law Bureau, to Hankou to conduct an investigation, it was delayed for several months before entering the final decision stage. In recent days, because National Assemblywoman Zhang Renji repeatedly urged Commander-in-Chief Bai to inquire about the outcome, Bai immediately telegraphed Acting President Li, and the original judgment was approved by telegram on the 22nd and sent to the Military Law Department of the Ninth Supply District for execution by shooting. Very few people outside knew about the execution. However, according to the judgment issued by the department, which was more than a thousand words long, it was determined that the fact of the gang rape by six people was largely the same as that stated by the victim, Chen Yu. The only main corroborating evidence was that the worker Chen Songlian admitted that he saw six people carrying the woman into a small room and found a pile of liquid like snot on the floor. He was accused of destroying evidence by wiping away this pile of "snot". Overall, the judgment was indeed made with great care.</p>

<h3>Pacific Region Nations Could Conclude Treaty in Mid-July Commonwealth Conference Will Discuss First</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] High-ranking British and American diplomatic circles here believe that countries in the Pacific region can form a collective security pact within four months to protect their territories and prevent the long-term intrusion of communism. Diplomatic circles on the western shore of the Atlantic have now begun to seriously study the work of placing the cornerstone of the Pacific Pact. This pact, along with the soon-to-be-formally-signed Atlantic Pact, will be the cornerstone of the British and American joint policy of maintaining world security and peace. It is said that the British government's decision to convene a Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London on April 23 is primarily motivated by the Pacific Pact. The United States has reportedly indicated to Britain that the participation of the British Commonwealth is a necessary prerequisite for the Pacific Pact. Therefore, before formally convening the Pacific Pact conference, the opinions of the British Commonwealth on this matter must first be determined. External experts here predict that if the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference convened next month goes smoothly, the Pacific Pact conference is expected to be held in Washington, D.C., in the latter half of May, and the pact could become a reality by July at the latest this year. Because the Atlantic Pact can serve as a precedent for the Pacific Pact, there should not be any major difficulties in the latter's discussions. British and American officials acknowledge that the main motivation for the Pacific Pact is the deteriorating situation faced by democratic countries in Asia and the Far East. At the same time, there are signs that the Soviet Union is shifting the Cold War front from Europe to Asia. The active expansion of communist forces in China, Burma, Vietnam, and Indonesia has made resolutions regarding the Pacific a major issue. The United States has previously advocated sympathy for ethnic movements in colonies, but due to the continuous expansion of communist forces, whether the United States should still retain this traditional policy in the Far East is a difficult decision. Related parties here also predict that the countries joining the Pacific Pact can be determined to be the United States (including the trust territories in the Pacific), Britain (including its colonies in the Pacific), France, the Netherlands (both including their colonies in the Pacific), Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Finland, and Canada. Those who may be invited to participate include Siam and the Philippines. As for those who have an opportunity to join only after their domestic situation is clarified, they include China, Japan, South Korea, Burma, etc.</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the Pacific Pact Colonial Movements Can Be Weakened The U.S. Has Recently Agreed to the British View</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] According to British sources here, the United States has recently agreed with Britain's view that supporting colonial movements at this time would indirectly weaken the position of Western countries, which is contrary to the original intention of the Atlantic Pact. The impact of the United States' acceptance of this view on the Far East region can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>In Vietnam: The war between France and the Viet Minh Nationalist Party is expected to continue for more than two years without interruption. After the realization of the Pacific Pact, France may obtain foreign aid under the pact to quell armed rebellions across the border.</p>
<p>In Indonesia: Although the Netherlands' military actions have temporarily gained the upper hand, the future is fraught with hidden worries. The establishment of the Pacific Pact can enable the Netherlands to obtain material and moral support.</p>
<p>In Burma: The Burmese government is already on the verge of collapse in the face of domestic armed rebellions and has sought aid from Britain and India. The establishment of the Pacific Pact will naturally enable the Burmese government to cope with internal unrest by borrowing foreign aid.</p>
<h3>Siam Eager to Join Pacific Region Alliance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bangkok, 22nd] A spokesman for the Siamese cabinet stated today: Siam is eager to join any possible defense group formed by non-communist countries in the Pacific and Asian regions.

<h3>Syngman Rhee Agrees to Conclude Pacific Alliance</h3>

<h3>Fighting Continues in the Suburbs of Lashio</h3>

<h3>Yoshida Trapped in Difficulties with New Budget Issues</h3>
<p>Planning to Request MacArthur to Save Face</p>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida visited Dodge, MacArthur's economic advisor, on the afternoon of the 22nd to begin political negotiations on the issue of budget preparation, and agreed to personally discuss it with MacArthur again in a day or two. According to Yoshida, he intends to ask MacArthur to save face for the ruling Liberal Party by at least retaining the following three promises: (1) canceling the transaction tax; (2) not reducing public utility fees; and (3) not increasing passenger transportation fees. Otherwise, the Liberal Party will be in an unfavorable position in the Diet, and there is also a risk of internal division. However, according to well-informed sources close to MacArthur's headquarters, "MacArthur's intention is very firm, and it is unlikely that Yoshida will be able to shake his major principle that the budget must be balanced."</p>

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Washington, 3rd Broadcasting: Acheson dismissed as completely absurd the Soviet Union's accusation that the United States is establishing military bases in Iran in preparation for an attack on the Soviet Union. Acheson also stated at a press conference today that the United States' concern for the North Atlantic region should not be misunderstood as a reduction in the United States' attention to Greece, Turkey, and the countries of the Near East and Middle East. Acheson said that there are currently 62 American officers and soldiers in Iran. Their mission is only to advise on matters such as the organization and replenishment of the Iranian army and to assist Iran in establishing appropriate international security forces. Acheson said that in recent weeks, the pressure on Iran from Soviet newspapers and radio broadcasts has obviously increased. The Soviet side often claims that the U.S. military obviously intends to make Iran a military base for attacking the Soviet Union, but such accusations are purely absurd.</p>

French representatives who were refused entry included religious leader Blier, female scientist Gouden, and communist poet Ellote.

<p>Soviet Representative's Talk</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 22nd] The Soviet delegation to the World Peace Conference has departed from Moscow to come here. The head of the delegation is musician Shostakovich. The Philadelphia Concert Hall has closed today to prepare for Shostakovich's piano recital.</p>

Fadeyev carried a novel about American race relations. He said that he hoped to meet the original author Sinclair in the United States. Shostakovich was very uneasy. He answered the first few questions very sincerely, and then pressed his forehead with a trembling hand and said, "More questions will confuse me." When asked if his music had gotten rid of petty bourgeois tendencies, he replied, "I think I will be able to correct this tendency." When a reporter told him that the American composer Stravinsky, who was born in the Soviet Union, refused to welcome him to the United States, he turned away.</p>

<h3>Headless Dismemberment Case: Important Clues Discovered; Substantial Reward for Information on Woman who Disposed of Package in River; Hairy, Yellowish, Large Feet, Robust Build; Victim Possibly Not a National; Meticulous Care by Murderer in Removing Fingerprints</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The headless dismemberment case discovered on Jinyi Road has now entered its third day. Thanks to the diligent investigation of all parties, significant progress has been made in the main leads of the case.</p>
<p>The case is the primary focus of attention for police investigators. Where did the body come from? According to a preliminary investigation, Zhang Wenneng, a secretary at the local Baojia (neighborhood watch) office, believes that this could not have been the work of rural farmers. He deduced that the body was transported from the city to Jinyi Road, possibly via Hengshan Road, Wanping Road, or Linsen Road. However, after investigators departed from Wanping Road, passed the Xujiahui Station, the "Luke Clinic" on Puxi Road, and returned along the Xujiahui Road riverbank, passing Tianyao Bridge, Jinyi Bridge, and Fenglin Bridge, paying attention to whether there were any traces of blood along the riverbank or whether any used goods stalls had sold oilcloth, women's jackets, cotton batting, or travel bags, the result was negative.</p>
<p>The police have a hypothesis that if the dismemberment of the body was not done within the city, then it must have been completed not far from Shanghai. There are two pieces of evidence to support this hypothesis: first, the striped cloth used to wrap the body is not a product of this city, but may have been produced in nearby areas with small-scale textile industries; second, the forensic examination determined that the time from when the victim was killed to when the body was moved did not exceed forty-eight hours. Currently, the police are preparing a transportation chart centered on Shanghai, including airplanes, ships, trains, and automobiles, to identify locations that can be reached within the above time limit, and then study the most likely locations to conduct focused investigations. At the same time, they are notifying local police, drivers, passengers, and rickshaw drivers to recall whether anyone carried a package similar to the one in this case a few days ago, and to report or confidentially inform the police as much as possible.</p>
<p>This reward for confidential information has yielded a major breakthrough as of yesterday. According to reliable sources, at 8:00 AM on the 22nd, on the Baotai Ferry from Puxi to Yangjiadu in Pudong, a woman suddenly threw a heavy package into the river, and her expression was extremely panicked. The woman was about forty years old, dressed in short shirt and pants, looking like a rural farmer. The only distinguishing feature was that her left eye was a snail-shell eye. Currently, this person is unknown and cannot be questioned, but it is believed that she may have an important connection to this case. The police have stated that they will spare no expense and hope that someone can provide various clues about the case, including the whereabouts of this woman.</p>
<p>The results of the third examination of the body by the police forensic doctor determined that the cartilage in the victim's throat had hardened, so it was inferred that the victim should be about forty years old. Furthermore, there were signs of trauma in the victim's throat before being killed, which may have been the cause of death. Secondly, the victim's pubic hair and armpit hair were yellowish-white. The neck muscles were thick, the feet were especially large, and the muscles were firm. The victim's nutrition appeared to be very good before death. All of this suggests that the victim may not be a national. Today, the police will re-examine the leg hair to confirm. According to Branch Director Cheng Yikuan, human hair from head to toe must be of the same type and color. If the victim's head were still present, it would be of great help in the investigation. However, the murderer discarded the head before moving the body, which proves that the murderer was already concerned that the victim's hair could be used for investigation. Furthermore, considering that the fingers and toes of the body were all cut off (leaving only one thumb, but the fingerprint was also removed), it is even more evident that the murderer deeply understands the importance of the victim's fingerprints falling into the hands of the police. The murderer is definitely a complete "insider" and must have in-depth knowledge of anatomy, without a doubt.</p>
<p>The work of household registration and record-keeping in our country has not yet been fully perfected, which is the greatest regret when investigating criminal cases. There is a body abandoned on Jinyi Road, so there must be a person missing from the population somewhere, but since the occurrence of the case, no missing person reports have been received. The police have now decided to issue a public announcement to inquire whether any sudden disappearances have been discovered recently in various places, or whether any abandoned human internal organs, fingers, toes, and heads have been found anywhere, so as to gain a deeper understanding of the case. According to the police, they initially suspected whether the body might have been discarded by a medical institution after an autopsy. However, after inquiring, it was learned that autopsy practices never involve cutting off the head or removing fingers and toes, and there is certainly no need to dismember it into dozens of pieces.</p>
<p>In addition, yesterday, police officer Zhang Huiyu of the Changshu Road Branch mentioned after investigating the case that he had heard Branch Chief Zhang Zhen of the Longhua Branch casually mention that on the 29th at midnight, he was walking from the branch back to his residence at Jinyi Bridge on Xiexu Road. When passing in front of the Shandong Guild Hall, he heard noisy sounds of shouting and even beatings inside the hall. Zhang was suspicious and went to the Shandong Guild Hall to investigate. He learned that there were fifty to sixty refugees living there. According to the person in charge, Zhang Zihe, they usually behave themselves and denied that there had been any quarrels on the 19th night. Later, Zhang secretly visited various villages near the guild hall and made a detailed record for reference.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] In the case of the dismembered body on Jinyi Road, female prosecutor Wang Youqin of the District Procuratorate went to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall with a forensic doctor for examination. She is currently drafting a report and has begun the investigation.</p>

<h3>Public Utility Prices to Rise by 70% Starting Today; Assumed Index is 2,350 Times</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Starting today, the prices of various public utilities in this city will be adjusted according to the estimated index, in accordance with the methods approved by the previous Council. According to news from various public utility companies and public transportation companies, the new prices for public utilities will be based on the base price multiplied by an assumed index of 2,350 times, which is about 70% higher than the original price. The new prices for trams, buses, and other items are being calculated overnight by various companies and will be implemented starting today.

However, according to the persons in charge of each company, the figures are generally the same as before. For example, the daily power generation of the Shanghai Electric Power Company is still above 3 million, and the supply of industrial electricity has not increased much compared to before.</p>
<h3>Premier He Earnestly Retains; Mayor Wu's Intention to Resign Remains Unchanged; Will Travel to Hangzhou with Wife in Early Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The reporter visited Mayor Wu yesterday to inquire whether, after Premier He of the new cabinet earnestly retained him, the mayor's intention to resign could be dispelled. The mayor replied that he had not received the order. As for changing the resignation to a vacation, he thought it was not very appropriate. Because the environment in Shanghai is complex and difficult, problems cannot be solved without exerting all efforts. Therefore, it is very difficult for others to replace him. Moreover, it is difficult to predict whether he will recover his health after two months of vacation. Therefore, he will still firmly request his resignation. As for the report that the mayor's wife has already moved to Taiwan, the mayor strongly denied it, saying that his wife is living peacefully in Shanghai. Starting in early next month, he will get rid of everything and travel to Hangzhou with his wife to enjoy the spring. He firmly believes that the beautiful scenery will greatly benefit his health.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 30 city councilors, including Tang Shichang, unanimously signed a petition to retain Mayor Wu and the bureau chiefs, asking them to dismiss their intention to resign.</p>

<h3>Train Car Corpse Case; Deadline of Half a Month to Solve; Concrete Clues Obtained After 24 Days</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The train car corpse case was discovered at the North Station at the beginning of this month and has been going on for 24 days. In these 24 days, although the police departments of the two railways have worked hard to investigate, there are still no concrete clues. Qian He, the director of the police department, believed that the case was of great importance and must be solved quickly. Therefore, he issued a hand order to the police officers handling the case yesterday, setting a deadline of half a month to solve the case.</p>
<p>A certain film production company in this city is very interested in the box corpse case and believes that if the tortuous and bizarre details of the case can be slightly embellished and compiled into a terrifying and suspenseful detective story and made into a film, it will definitely be a sensation, and the business is absolutely guaranteed. The company specially sent personnel to visit the relevant departments of the two railway bureaus yesterday to make contact.</p>
<p>Also, the plainclothes police officers handling the box corpse case have been working extremely hard in recent days. As for the section in the Suzhou telegram in this newspaper a few days ago that an official from a certain agency in Jiangyin seemed to recognize the deceased, the railway police authorities are also paying close attention to it, but said that the letter from Jiangyin has not yet been received. If someone recognizes the deceased and can find their family, then solving the case is just around the corner.</p>

<h3>Continuing Influx of Refugee Students to Shanghai: Disappointment Expressed Due to Lack of Assistance; Absence of Freedom in Beiping and Tianjin Main Reason for Departure</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In recent days, there has been a continuous stream of students from North China fleeing to Shanghai. Yesterday, the "Jing Yu" and "Li Tai" ships arrived from Qingdao, carrying more than two hundred and fifty middle school and university students. They are experiencing difficult living conditions, with many lacking adequate food and clothing. Their journey to Shanghai was facilitated by the Qingdao Municipal Government Temporary Relief Committee, which arranged free passage for them. After arriving yesterday morning, they immediately went to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Education Bureau with their luggage, seeking solutions to their food, lodging, and onward transportation problems to the south. Following discussions between the two bureaus, aside from those who had relatives or friends in Shanghai or were able to stay in hostels through their own means, the rest were sent to the Third Reception Center of the Caohejing Municipal Relief Association for temporary accommodation. Meanwhile, the Social Affairs Bureau and the Education Bureau contacted the Railway Bureau to arrange train tickets to Hangzhou, with the necessary train fares being provided by the Municipal Relief Association. After going to Hangzhou, they will contact the Youth Re-enrollment and Employment Assistance Committee of the Ministry of Education to discuss educational opportunities. There is news that the Ministry of Education is planning to establish Southeast University in Fujian Province, to which they are all pinning fervent hopes.</p>
<p>These more than two hundred and fifty male and female students belong to schools such as Peking University, Normal University, Chaoyang University, Northeastern University, Changchun University, Changbai Normal School, Northeast Provisional Middle School, and Northeast Zhongshan Middle School. They successively left Jinan from Beiping and Tianjin before and after the Communist Party of China (CPC) occupied Beiping, and then went to Qingdao via Weixian. The most recent group left Beiping at the beginning of this month. According to them, after the CPC entered Beiping, in addition to the original schools, three new universities were established. Among them, the Military and Political University is a place for training military cadres, with Ye Jianying as the president. The predecessor of North China University was the Anti-Japanese University, with Wu Yuzhang as the president, and its purpose is to train political cadres. In addition, the North China People's Revolutionary University is located in the western suburbs. The entry level of the school ranges from elementary school to university, and there are now more than 10,000 students. The curriculum includes political common sense and revolutionary thought, etc. After graduation from training, they will go to work in the countryside.</p>
<p>One in Ten Students from Beiping, Tianjin, and the Northeast Flees</p>
<p>As for the major universities and middle schools in the Northeast that had moved to Beiping and Tianjin, the CPC relocated the schools back to Changchun, Harbin, and Shenyang on February 28. There are more than 10,000 students from the Northeast in Beiping and Tianjin, and about one-tenth of them have fled south. They believe that there is no freedom of life in Beiping under the control of the CPC, so they choose to go south despite the difficulties and dangers. However, after arriving in Shanghai, they are quite disappointed due to the lack of government assistance. It is said that there are still students from various schools in North China who want to go south, and they urgently hope that the government can take more responsibility and provide more care for this matter.</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Declares That It Is Not Handling Registration on Behalf</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Education Bureau, in response to a news report yesterday that the Education Bureau was handling the registration of refugee students from North China on its behalf, specifically declared: "The Ministry of Education has not entrusted the bureau to handle the registration of refugee students. However, the Youth Re-enrollment and Employment Assistance Committee of the Ministry of Education dispatched Mr. Yu Xiaoci from Hangzhou on the 16th of this month, carrying a temporary relief fund of 2 million yuan, to Shanghai to prepare for the registration and relocation of refugee students. As a result of consultations between Mr. Yu and the Education Bureau, the work of providing relief to refugee students is extremely heavy and must be handled by a dedicated institution established by the Ministry of Education in Shanghai, and there must be a fixed budget to be effective. Mr. Yu immediately returned to Hangzhou with the relief fund of 2 million yuan that evening to ask for instructions, and has not yet come to Shanghai."</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Representatives Xi Zhenyong, Zhang Zhihua, and Gu He from the Municipal Middle School Teachers and Staff Friendship Association, and representatives Li Zhanren, Huang Shiping, and Xu Yuchang from the Municipal Primary School Teachers and Staff Friendship Association, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 10:00 am yesterday, and asked the mayor to withdraw his resignation, and made three requests. The mayor said that his resignation was due to physical exhaustion. As for the requests made, he replied to each one as follows: (1) Requesting the issuance of 1,000 times the salary before the 25th of this month. The mayor informed that at least another 450 times can be issued before the end of the month, and if there is a way to raise funds, it can be increased. After the central government announces the public and educational index for each region, Shanghai can issue the full amount. The representatives hoped that the amount promised by the mayor would be issued before the 28th or 29th. (2) Requesting the maintenance of in-kind rations and the issuance of overdue edible oil and coal briquettes. The mayor agreed to urge the competent authorities. The request to continue monthly distribution in the future will be submitted to the central government. (3) Requesting an increase in welfare rice to respond to the grain storage movement. The mayor stated that two dou of rice per person will continue to be distributed monthly. In addition, the mayor advised that the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Friendship Association should postpone sending representatives to Nanjing for various petitions. The mayor believes that the cabinet has just been completed, and the measures for public and educational treatment have not yet been determined, so we can wait for the announcement before determining the attitude.</p>
<p>The Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Friendship Association will hold a joint meeting again at Yucai Middle School at 4:00 pm today.</p>

<h3>Habitual Thieves on Two Railway Lines Do Not Change Their Ways; Commit Crimes Again After Being Released from Prison</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Habitual thief Xiao Xizi, one of the "Five Tiger Generals" who ran rampant on the two railway lines, had been arrested with his accomplices Hangzhou, Wang Asi, Guan Afeng (female), and Changjiao Ganbin for theft in May, December of the 35th year, and June of the 36th year, and was sentenced to six months in prison by the District Court. Unexpectedly, after the criminals were released from prison, they used the alias Yang Zhengyuan, and took their accomplice Zhang Binghua (nicknamed Xiao Tailor), to resume their career as thieves. A few days ago, the two thieves were wandering on Platform 1 of the North Railway Station, waiting for an opportunity to steal. They were spotted by the railway police, who noticed that their actions were suspicious. They stepped forward to inquire whether they had train tickets. The two criminals were afraid and tried to escape, so they were detained. After being sent to the police section for questioning, they confessed that they often committed theft with their accomplices in various stations and trains on the two railway lines. On the 3rd of this month, they stole 250,000 yuan of huge amount of money in gold yuan at the North Railway Station, and stole 135,000 yuan on the train to Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Housing Dispute Resolved; Wang Hanlun Will Go to the Countryside</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since this newspaper revealed that Wang Hanlun, a veteran movie star from twenty years ago, was impoverished and her residence was forced to move, it has attracted attention from all sectors of society. Yesterday, the Land Administration Bureau summoned the landlord Zhou Xiangsheng and the tenant Wang Hanlun to mediate. After persuasion by the person in charge of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhou agreed to move out of the kiosk of the Xiangsheng Apartment within half a month. The bureau also believed that Wang's situation was pitiful and agreed to give her six taels of gold as her moving expenses. Both parties established a record in the Land Administration Bureau, and this housing dispute came to an end. It is reported that Wang, because of her old age and faded beauty, has no confidence in returning to the stage or silver screen, and after receiving the moving expenses, she will move to the countryside to spend her twilight years.</p>
<h3>"Air Palace" Has a Very High Speed; China National Aviation Corporation's New Aircraft Will Arrive in Hong Kong at the End of the Month; Shanghai Flight Will Only Take Two Hours</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] China National Aviation Corporation ordered six Convair passenger planes in the United States after the war. Two of them have already been delivered and will fly from the United States to Hong Kong at the end of this month. This Convair aircraft is one of the world's newest passenger aircraft. It is said that its performance is even better than the "Sky Master" aircraft, especially its speed is very high, it can fly more than 300 miles per hour, which is unmatched by other aircraft. Its internal equipment is similar to the "Sky Master" aircraft. The cabin is full of sofa seats, the temperature and air pressure are automatically adjusted, and the engine sound is completely isolated, so passengers will not have the uncomfortable feeling of high-altitude flight such as ear pain, vomiting, and palpitations. The aircraft has two engines with great horsepower, which is equivalent to the four engines of the "Room Master" aircraft. The disadvantage is that it cannot withstand long-distance flights, so this time it flies from the United States to Hong Kong, it cannot take the shortcut across the Pacific Ocean, but detour through Europe and Africa, because there are more intermediate stops where it can land and refuel. In addition, this type of passenger aircraft is particularly luxurious and requires good airports. In addition to Hong Kong, the only domestic airports that can be used at present are Shanghai and Beiping. In the future, if Beiping can be opened to traffic, the company will fly the Hong Kong-Shanghai-Beiping line with this type of aircraft. It will take only two hours to reach Shanghai from Hong Kong, and the round trip to Hong Kong and Beiping can be made on the same day. It is heard that the company authorities may name this type of aircraft the "Air Palace."</p>
<h3>Investigation of Hongxing Factory's Tax Evasion; Accused of Corruption and Embezzlement; Direct Tax Bureau Supervisor Wu Zhi; Case Sent Back for Retrial After Conviction</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Xu Daofu, a professor at Zhejiang University (formerly an employee of the Hongxing Yarn Factory), previously reported that Wu Zhi, supervisor of the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau, was corrupt and embezzled when he was ordered to investigate the Hongxing Yarn Factory's tax evasion. The District Court originally sentenced the defendant to three years and six months in prison. It is now learned that the High Court sent it back to the District Court for retrial based on the following three points: (1) The defendant's report to the bureau criticized the Hongxing Yarn Factory for tax evasion and did not protect the factory; (2) The Hongxing property details list has been taken back by Xu Daofu, with two of Xu's business cards as proof; (3) It cannot be confirmed about the Weida printing shop that was the location of bribery. Yesterday, District Court Judge Wang Kanghou summoned the defendant and relevant person Xu Wende, and witnesses Zhou Huikang, the tea waiter of the Oriental Hotel, and Zhang Yuliang, the tea waiter of the Weida Hotel, for questioning. Because there were other witnesses who were not present, after a brief interrogation, the court ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement of Grain Depot Unpolished Rice Case; Boatman Chen Jinrong Sentenced</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Chen Jinrong, the boatman who embezzled 170 bags of unpolished rice from the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food, was sentenced to three months in prison by Judge Chen Shijing of the District Court for the crime of embezzlement. Because the defendant heard that the General Warehouse had purchased 563 bags of unpolished rice in Suzhou, through the introduction of Song Zuomei and Xia Yuanqing, Chen transported it to Shanghai for delivery to the Ministry. The shipment started on December 25th of the old lunar calendar last year and arrived in Shanghai on January 4th. Unexpectedly, Chen embezzled as many as 170 bags in the middle, falsely claiming that he encountered wind and collided with buoys in Zhoujiadu, Huangpu River, and some rice bags fell into the water, and some were automatically thrown into the river. After investigation, there were discrepancies, so the Water Police Branch detained Chen. After the District Court summoned relevant witnesses for interrogation, the defendant's embezzlement was confirmed and the judgment was made as above.</p>

When passing near the Qiu Tianbao Silver Shop in Sipailou in the city, four thieves suddenly emerged from the darkness, claiming to be policemen, and ordered them to stop with guns. They searched the fishmongers' pockets and found more than 100,000 yuan in funds. Just as they were about to turn around and flee, Yuan, because all his funds of 26,000 yuan were robbed and he could not make a living, stepped forward and knelt down begging for the return of the funds. The thieves saw that he was chattering endlessly, fearing that he would ruin their plan, so they drew their guns and fired a shot, hitting his right arm on the spot. The thieves scattered and fled. Shortly after, the police officer No. 7846 from the Yimiao Police Branch heard the sound and rushed to the scene. In addition to sending Yuan Jinhai to Renji Hospital for treatment, he immediately reported to the branch for pursuit.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] After repeated adjustments to the passenger tickets for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, there are not as many first and second class passengers as in the past, but the number of third and fourth class passengers has suddenly increased. The original ticket windows in the third and fourth class waiting rooms could no longer cope, so "scalpers" took the opportunity to move around, resulting in legitimate passengers queuing for days without being able to buy tickets. The North Shanghai General Station specifically stipulated yesterday that each passenger is limited to purchasing two third and fourth class tickets, and employees and police of this railway are strictly prohibited from purchasing tickets on behalf of passengers. If passengers see railway employees or police purchasing tickets on behalf of passengers, they can report to the General Station.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Peddlers Ji Chonghuan, Li Biao, and tailor Dai Jiaren, purchased several cartons of Three Gun cigarettes from Wang Dingfa on January 27 this year.

On the afternoon of February 1, they invited several soldiers of unknown names to Wang Dingfa's home on Xingjia Road to reason with him. Wang happened to be out, so Wang's wife received them. Ji and others took the opportunity to sell fake cigarettes and planned to detain Wang and send him to the team headquarters for detention, threatening to extort 10,000 yuan to settle the matter. Wang's wife sold her gold ring and white rice and paid the money. Afterwards, Wang sued the police station and transferred it to the District Prosecutor's Office for prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Guo Zugan of the District Court sentenced the three defendants to ten months in prison for extortion and fraud.</p>

<h3>The Isolated City of Northern Jiangsu: Yizheng</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang to this Newspaper, 19th] On the afternoon of the 16th, this reporter, along with several colleagues from Zhenjiang, accepted the invitation of Zuo Zhiren, the Magistrate of Yizheng County, and boarded a special boat to inspect the last remaining county seat east of the Jinpu Railway and north of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>After the north and south banks were blockaded, the Yangtze River's desolation defies description. The waves still surge endlessly eastward, but it's now rare to see a single boat on the river. The sky is filled with grey clouds, threatening rain. The images of sails rising and falling in the past only serve to cast the shadows of memory into the abyss of reality.</p>
<p>Riding into Yizheng</p>
<p>At dusk, we arrived at Siyuan Canal, where a warship named "Liansheng" was anchored. Siyuan Canal is four li away from Yizheng City. Along this four-li stretch of highway and on both sides, semi-permanent bridgehead fortifications have already been built. Yizheng City lies beyond these fortifications. Magistrate Zuo Zhiren told us that this road is the only retreat route Yizheng City has to the south, and the Liansheng warship will be Yizheng City's only reliable support. A misty rain had already begun to fall. He mounted his horse, and with the clip-clop of hooves, accompanied us northward towards Yizheng City. Magistrate Zuo and Chen Ce'an, the commander of the county's First Security Regiment, greeted us outside the city. We met in the dim twilight and walked into the city.</p>
<p>Yizheng's city walls are so low that even city defense fortifications seem unusable. On the streets, we could vaguely see barricades for street fighting built from bricks. Beside these barricades, or at intersections, stood public checkpoints, manned by people in long robes, holding wooden sticks, shouting "Halt!" with great spirit. Some of the common people were secretly peeking at us from their doorways. One wonders what expectations they, living in this isolated city, have for us Western-suited guests of the magistrate?</p>
<p>A History of Rise and Fall of the Isolated City</p>
<p>Yizheng has a century of rise and fall in its history. Over eighty jewelry stores, seventy-two pawnshops – this shadow of prosperity was burned away by the flames of the Red Turban Rebellion. However, the Twelve-Wharf Town in the southeast of the city remained a distribution center for Huai salt until before the war, with a population of over 130,000. Unfortunately, after the Grand Canal changed its course to enter the river at Guazhou, the section of the canal from Yangzhou to Twelve-Wharf became silted up and impassable, only navigable by small wooden boats. Twelve-Wharf's status plummeted, and coupled with the destruction during the War of Resistance, Twelve-Wharf became desolate, and Yizheng became even more desolate. Today, most of the foreign-style houses and mansions in Twelve-Wharf have been torn down, becoming an important bridgehead position. As for Yizheng, an isolated city, stranded on the riverbank, the urban population has dwindled to just over 4,300 people. Looking at the desolate long street within the city and the ruins and rubble everywhere, it's truly disheartening, realizing that the dream of prosperity is becoming increasingly distant and vague for Yizheng!</p>
<p>With the shift in the government's overall political and strategic plans, almost all of the Northern Jiangsu region was abandoned. Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Tongzhou were evacuated one after another. But Yizheng, this isolated city on the riverbank, was left behind. This is something that the local Communist cadres find unbelievable. In late January, after the Nationalist troops retreated from Luhe, Tianchang, Yangzhou, and Taixian, Yizheng began its fate of facing the river on one side and being surrounded by enemies on three sides. Around the Lunar New Year, the 208th and 203rd detachments of the local Communists, as well as units of the Southeast Detachment, all attacked the city in succession. The Communist soldiers reached the edge of the city, shouting to the defenders outside the north gate, "Come over here and celebrate the New Year! We have cured meat, salted chicken, and Qianmen brand cigarettes!" With the cooperation of the county security regiment and the stationed troops, Yizheng stood firm. Magistrate Zuo Zhiren and the other military and political officials hadn't slept well for eight nights. At this time, the county government was left with only the magistrate, a section chief, and Gao Chonghua, the chief of the police bureau.</p>
<p>The Tense Current Situation</p>
<p>Although the Communist offensive has temporarily stopped, the situation in the isolated city becomes more tense with each passing day. The territory of Yizheng County, which was originally not large, now only has the Twelve-Wharf and the city area, and these aren't even fully intact. The production areas are not under control, and military and civilian food supplies are a problem. The county government originally had one security regiment, and recently another one was established. The security regiments' provisions are, as usual, the responsibility of the local area. The county government has two sources of income, the main one being the land tax. Before the war, Yizheng's land tax often fell short of 70%. Normally, 60% of the daily expenses relied on Twelve-Wharf. Last month, the common people couldn't even collect their rent grain, so naturally, the land tax was out of the question. In addition, there were revenues from autonomous taxes and levies, including house tax, entertainment tax, feast tax, business tax, and slaughter tax. According to the statistics for the past month, the monthly income was less than 400,000 yuan. 400,000 yuan is naturally a paltry sum, but looking at how dilapidated Yizheng City is, not only do I think that levying taxes on the people is a cruel act, but the magistrate also agrees. In this situation, just considering the monthly grain ration of over 2,000 dan of rice needed by the security regiments, naturally, besides requesting assistance from the provincial government south of the Yangtze, they can only go to the Communist-controlled areas to seize their public grain! The Yizheng County government employees haven't been paid their February salaries yet, and the soldiers of the security regiment haven't been paid their salaries from January until now. After the Yangtze River was blockaded, the outside county government employees and Baojia chiefs have all run away. Luckily, Magistrate Zuo Zhiren is a veteran officer, and he still has a group of friends who are surplus officers who can be pulled over to suffer with him.</p>
<p>Within three hours of this reporter's arrival in Yizheng, what I saw and heard was just such a bleak and difficult outline. Under the protection of four or five light and heavy machine guns, and with the faint light of a flashlight, we attended the county government's "banquet." Afterwards, the magistrate accompanied us along the dark and muddy streets, sending us to the hotel to rest.</p>
<p>It was a night of slanting wind and fine rain, a night of chilling spring cold. In the isolated lamp of the lodging, the barking of dogs in the desolate city surrounded us with a sense of bleakness and silence. I took off my coat, crawled into a cold and greasy thin quilt, and fell asleep fully clothed. In the sound of the raindrops, I seemed to faintly hear sporadic gunfire coming from the north in the middle of the night. People here all say, "Gunfire is an embellishment in daily life." Naturally, I wasn't surprised.</p>
<p>Wax Temple Position</p>
<p>The next morning, Commander Chen Ce'an accompanied us to inspect the stronghold five li outside the north gate of the city—the Wax Temple. A month ago, this road outside the north gate was still an unsafe area. Only after Chairman Ding Zhi-pan came to Yizheng to inspect and instructed that the Wax Temple stronghold should be controlled did this road become passable.</p>
<p>The Wax Temple is located on an earthen mound, and together with the North Mountain Temple to its east, it serves as a defensive screen for the north of Yizheng City. From the bunkers, we looked far into the distance and spotted a column of Communist soldiers operating in a pine forest three or four li away. Bang! Bang! Gunshots rang out, firing several shots at the target. The sentries in front also responded by firing a few shots at the stronghold. I smelled a strong gunpowder scent. Both the Wax Temple and the North Mountain Temple are large temples. Now the temples have been torn down, and only an old tree stands tall, still able to evoke a sense of desolation. The area near the earthen mound used to be a maple forest, known as "Red Leaves of North Mountain" in the Eight Scenic Spots of Yizheng. Now, only winding trenches and rows of bunkers remain, waiting for unfortunate blood to paint a red hue on this unfortunate land! I looked south into the distance. The Yangtze River was like silk, and the mountains of the south were faintly visible between the silk threads. The pagoda of Tianning Temple in Yizheng City was also clearly visible. This temple was where Sun Chuanfang, the commander-in-chief of the Five-Province Allied Army, had his headquarters when he led his troops across the Yangtze River. Today, the talk of "crossing the river" resounds throughout the north and south of the Yangtze. Without having to delve into distant history, just the changes in the past thirty years are enough to fill one with emotion!</p>
<p>Returning to Zhenjiang</p>
<p>On the way back to the city, this reporter saw the streets more clearly. Since the north and south banks of the Yangtze River were blockaded, it's difficult to transport goods from the south. Although the number of consumers is limited, general prices are already about five times higher than in Zhenjiang. Along the main street between the north and south gates, shops occupy less than one-tenth or two-tenths of the space. The north of the city seems to be a "market" area, with many vendors. Rice sells for 20,000 yuan per dan, which is cheaper than in the south, but the only source of food for the people is now to smuggle it in from the Communist areas. Those who could leave Yizheng have already left. Those who stayed are either unwilling or unable to leave. They seem very unconcerned about the development of the situation. In reality, being in a besieged city, they can't care even if they want to.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 17th, this reporter boarded a boat back to Zhenjiang again. The dock was in a mess. This one was the wife of a military officer, and that one was a relative of someone else. Everyone was scrambling to board the boat to go south. This seemed like a mockery of the blockade of the Yangtze River! Everyone seemed to have no attachment to Yizheng. Let the development of the situation verify the future fate of Yizheng.</p>

<h3>Hail in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Suzhou to this Newspaper, 22nd] After days of continuous rain and lingering cold, hail suddenly fell at 6 PM on the 21st, lasting about an hour. The hail was the size of soybeans. At 8 AM on the 22nd, sleet fell again, lasting about twenty minutes.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: A Duet of Farming and Weaving in the City and Countryside</h3>
<p>— Reporter for this Newspaper: Li Tianxing</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Wujin to this Newspaper, 21st] The people of Changzhou excel nationwide in two things: (1) The county has over 2,000 elementary schools and over 50 public and private middle schools. The number of educational institutions exceeds the total number in remote provinces such as Gansu and Guizhou, ranking first among all counties in the country. (2) Cloth production: before 1937, the county used over 160,000 bales of yarn annually, with daily sales of 500 bales. The county had over 20,000 looms, producing over 20,000-30,000 bolts of cloth daily. This number is not small. At that time, the price of cotton cloth in Shanghai was dictated by Changzhou.—This is a page of glorious history from the past. The trials of the eight-year War of Resistance and the gloom of the three-year civil war have made progress increasingly difficult. Industry and commerce as a whole are trapped in a precarious situation. But even in its current state of decline, Changzhou still retains the characteristics of the old gentry. It still has some assets and a deep and strong foundation, facing the arrival of the new era head-on.</p>
<p>Changzhou's textile industry has a bright future because of the human-made environment that has been brewing and developing for decades, and the textile and dyeing industries have a duet of both urban and rural elements.</p>
<p>The Twin Stars of Textile: Dacheng and Minfeng</p>
<p>The largest textile factories in the urban area, and the twin stars of Changzhou's textile industry, are the Dacheng Factory and the Minfeng Factory. Dacheng has three factories in Changzhou. The first factory is the main factory, located outside the South Gate. Before the War of Resistance, it had 20,500 spindles and 4,800 thread spindles. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, it endured hardships and struggled to survive. After the victory, it recovered from the ruins and underwent extensive repairs. It now has 29,700 spindles. The thread spindles have been moved to the third factory for spinning. Currently, it produces 74-75 bales of cotton yarn per day. The yarn spun is 42-count, 32-count, 22-count, 20-count, and also low-grade 10-count. Except for the low-grade 10-count and a portion of the 20-count, which are sold as yarn, the rest are used for weaving in the cloth factory. The weaving department had 756 looms before the war. During the War of Resistance, the looms and factory buildings were completely destroyed in military incidents. In the year of victory, reconstruction efforts were undertaken on the ruins. Steel frames and cement, cement and steel frames, workers and materials were brought together. After more than a year, 540 newly built looms began to operate again at the end of 1947. From April 1948, they gradually increased, and by August, they had returned to the old number of 756. This shows how difficult the recovery was. Now, they produce cloth day and night, with 720 bolts of one-two-pound fine cloth and 540 bolts of Shantung silk fabric per day. The fine cloth is trademarked "Butterfly Ball" and is shipped to Shanghai for transshipment to Hong Kong and Guangdong. The Shantung silk fabric is supplied to the second factory for dyeing and finishing. The second factory is located outside the East Gate and is divided into finishing, bleaching, and dyeing groups. It specializes in producing various colored cloths, producing 2,000-3,000 bolts per day. Currently, due to the difficult environment, they are forced to retreat everywhere and cannot engage in intensive, comprehensive production. The third factory is located at Baijiaqiao in the East Gate. It currently has 20,160 spindles and 416 looms. Due to the cutoff of raw cotton sources, only 7,000 spindles and 200 looms are operating. The rest of the spindles and looms are idle and dormant. They work day and night shifts every Saturday and Sunday, producing about 8 bales of 20-count cotton yarn and about 2 bales of 60-count double-strand yarn per day, and about 500-600 bolts of cotton cloth. The three factories have about 3,000 employees.</p>
<p>The Minfeng Factory is located outside the Small South Gate and has a long history. It currently has 28,500 spindles, producing about 60 bales of 20-count "Fairy" yarn per day, and 300 looms, producing 900 bolts of fine cloth per day. The entire factory employs about 1,600 people. In terms of spinning, due to the difficulty in purchasing raw cotton recently, a portion of the work is only done for the American Aid Flower Yarn Cloth United Corporation to spin 32-count fine yarn. They are working for others and making slow progress, trying to survive this difficult period.</p>
<p>Success in all things ultimately depends on human effort. Liu Guojun, the manager of Dacheng, and Jiang Shangda, the manager of Minfeng, have not only developed their own businesses but have also made real contributions to the local area, implicitly acting as leaders in Changzhou's business community.</p>
<p>Over Eighty Factories, Scattered Like Stars</p>
<p>In addition, scattered throughout the city and suburbs are over eighty small and medium-sized dyeing and weaving factories, such as Tongcheng, Xieyuan, Minhua, and Yifeng, which are all considered outstanding. However, no one can escape the hardships of the times. The textile and dyeing industries today also face a serious crisis. The source of raw cotton is blocked, yarn is scarce, and the prices of coal, oil, electricity, and fuel are expensive. Sales of finished products are declining daily, and the scope is shrinking. Coupled with heavy taxes and levies, although prices are constantly rising, they can never keep up with costs... These series of issues are ruthless and extremely challenging. They demand answers. The price limit imposed on August 19 last year was like a violent storm, and many factories with weaker capital have not yet recovered. The situation is quite "tragic"! There are quite a few "?" symbols, and they are large!</p>
<p>A New Picture of Farming and Weaving in the Countryside</p>
<p>In addition to the dozens of large, medium, and small factories mentioned above, Changzhou's cloth production also has a "scattered troops" production area: rural weaving. Decades of development in which the countryside engages in both farming and weaving have created a completely new picture. This production area is centered on Hutang Bridge outside the South Gate and surrounded by dozens of li of land. Hutang Bridge has become the general term.</p>
<p>Hutang Bridge is a small rural town located about seven li outside the South Gate of Changzhou. The Wuyi Road runs north-south, and a tributary of the Grand Canal runs east-west, providing convenient land and water transportation. The surrounding countryside is dotted with villages and densely populated. Historically, the farmland has not been enough to distribute, and the surplus labor has had to find side jobs to make a living—some handicrafts, such as comb, domino, and playing card making. The water-ground fan bones and bamboo-carved fan bones used to be famous in Hutang Bridge, but they have now declined. What has risen in their place is weaving. The current situation is that in Hutang Bridge, nine out of ten households have looms, with loom connected to loom and weaving following weaving. In the countless villages surrounding Hutang Bridge for more than ten li, loom after loom is connected from door to door, with weaving following weaving. Fields are connected, forming a sea of mulberry, hemp, wheat seedlings, and green clouds. In the villages, in addition to the crowing of chickens and barking of dogs, there is the sound of "click-clack, click-clack" of the looms. Every farm family has at least one loom, and some have as many as three or four. Men and women, old and young, work diligently in their light industry with joyful hearts. Every village and every household thoroughly understands warp yarns, is skilled in sizing yarns, is even more skilled in weaving, can also remember how to dye, and can also sell cloth and buy yarn. They are also good at calculating profits. If each family is likened to a factory, then parents, children, grandchildren, and daughters-in-law are all factory owners, but they are also workers at the same time. There is never any "labor-capital dispute" or "factory management" between them, and there is no "cost of living index." They share joys and hardships, and their interests are aligned. Men and women, old and young, farm when it's time to farm, and weave when it's time to weave. Over the past decade, their hard work has made Hutang Bridge famous for its cloth, creating a beautiful picture of farming and weaving in the local area. New tile-roofed houses have been built in succession in the villages, and every family is well-off, presenting a picture of prosperity. The most commendable point is that there are very few idlers who drink tea and gamble. Diligence and thrift have become the norm.</p>
<p>Three Years of Success in Production Cooperation</p>
<p>In the town, there is a First Cotton Cloth Production Cooperative, which has been established for three years. The chairman of the board is Mr. Yang Tingbao, a local person who is extremely enthusiastic about social causes. The cooperative's headquarters is in Hutang Bridge, and branch offices have been established in Nanxiawu, Mingfeng, and Jiangwan, which are more than ten li away. In the ranks of rural weaving, they have added the strength of organization to production and sales. Generally, the situation is that they are managed in groups, with each village having a group leader to lead the members. Each group has anywhere from two to twenty-two members. One member has one loom. Currently, the Hutang Bridge headquarters has 55 groups, with over 500 looms. Together with the Nanxiawu and Mingfeng branch offices, the total number of looms is between 800 and 900. The looms are all iron-wood treadle looms, which are considered relatively new. The Hutang Bridge headquarters alone produces between 200 and 300 bolts of cloth per day, requiring 6-7 bales of yarn. The products are mostly 10.5-pound 26 plain cloth and light and heavy twill, and 8.5-pound 23 plain cloth and 8-pound type B 23 plain cloth. After the price limit on August 19 last year, in order to make it easier to sell, they produced a large quantity of flour sack cloth. The Shanghai Fu Xing Flour Mill and the local Chengyu Ding Flour Mill are all specially contracted long-term customers. The cooperative adopts absolutely strict standardization for the quality of the products of each member. The length, width, warp and weft density are all stipulated. Any slight difference is rejected. All the white unfinished products are dyed and finished by the dyeing factory. According to the evaluation, the quality is superior and is better than the products of ordinary cloth factories. Therefore, the reputation is outstanding.</p>
<p>The cooperative's business is in production and sales, and it is commendable that it is purely service-oriented. Every morning, members are required to exchange cloth for yarn. The procedures are orderly, and the profits are calculated based on the yarn. The current index is 17 handles of 8-count yarn for plain cloth and 25.5 handles for twill. Depending on the prosperity of the sales, the profits are also reduced accordingly. Everything is based on yarn and is not affected by inflation. Country people do things so honestly. It seems ordinary, but it is actually extraordinary. As for the many weavers in the Hutang Bridge area who do not belong to the cooperative, they each have their own characteristics. The types of cloth woven are not limited to one. Some specialize in weaving woolen cloth, some weave striped cloth, and some weave figured cloth. There are no statistics on the quantity of their finished products. However, every morning, large quantities are brought to the city, and the morning market on Xiyingli Street is entirely a world of yarn and cloth. It is lively and vibrant.</p>
<p>Here, I should mention Mr. Yang Tingbao, who enthusiastically promotes and personally leads this cause.</p>
<p>The Gospel Messenger, Old Man Yang Tingbao</p>
<p>Yang Tingbao is a local and an elder who is over sixty years old, but he is very energetic. He has courage,魄力, enthusiasm, and methods in his life. From his career, he is truly a gospel messenger for the countryside. Twenty years ago, he promoted sericulture in the local area and achieved great success. Then, he tried to operate machine drainage and electric irrigation, which succeeded in 1937. Now, most of the land within thirty li south of Changzhou Hutang Cotton is electric irrigation. This scene is quite new and approaches scientific farming and mechanized farming. Old Man Yang is truly a pioneer. Based on his decades of work experience, Old Man Yang has realized the philosophy of life and explored the truth of the universe. He bravely dedicates himself to society and does not hesitate to sacrifice his small self to benefit the masses in the countryside. He is currently leading a vibrant First Cotton Cloth Production Cooperative in Hutang Bridge, fully demonstrating the cooperative spirit of "I am for everyone" with facts. He has already won the trust of the masses. The headquarters and the Nanxiawu, Mingfeng, and Jiangwan branch offices have a total of over 800 members. All 800+ looms are led by him. Without being a hero, he is still commendable. This reporter had a conversation with Old Man Yang, and Old Man Yang said that if the situation is peaceful, there will be no problem in expanding Hutang Bridge to 5,000 looms. Old Man Yang's next plan is to seek further progress in the current situation. He wants to completely convert the foot-operated iron-wood looms into small Leimada iron looms and weave cloth with electricity. It is very convenient to use the electricity from the Qishuyan Power Plant nearby. If successful, then the products will never have to worry about being eliminated. The products can compete with the exquisite Longtou fine cloth. If successful, then Hutang Bridge will become the largest and most ideal cloth factory in China. I believe that the day of realizing this ideal is not far away! Old Man Yang, stroking his sparse beard, excitedly declared his ideal. This reporter believes that the broad and progressive development of the new farming and weaving picture is very much in line with the traditional spirit of "men farm and women weave" in China for thousands of years. This path of light industrial development will correct the malignant symptoms of "capital concentration and industrial concentration" and turn into a new road of universal benefit and wealth dispersed among the people. Obviously, the dawn of a new rural era has already been revealed in Hutang Bridge.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch from Yixing, 21st] The major kidnapping case of Ma Haorong, a wealthy man from Fucun, No. 10 Bao, Heqiao Town, in this county, has been solved by Liu Hanqing, the head of Zhongxi Township, who led his troops to crack the case near Wudong Bridge across the lake at the border of Wuyi, rescuing the hostage Ma Haorong and capturing bandits Jiang Wenqin and Wang Zhengpei alive. It is now known that the main culprit in the case, Ling Chao (Jin Gen), disappeared after the incident. While the township office was pursuing him, Ling's wife, Xing Baolai, came to Heqiao to inquire about the news and was spotted by Township Head Liu, who ordered his guards to arrest her and bring her to the office. After a thorough search of Ling's residence, a rectangular seal impersonating the "Jiangsu Chengxi Yilianfang Office" of the New Fourth Army, as well as signed chops and tax collection notices, were found under the rice bin. After interrogating his wife overnight, she confessed her husband's hiding place. Last night a team was dispatched to arrest him and bring him to justice.</p>

<h3>National Bank Sells Over 6,000 Taels at High Prices: Gold Market Hits Limit Up with First Sound</h3>
<p>Market Opens Up, Rises to Limit Up, Then Price Waxes and Wanes</p>
<p>The gold market's trend this morning reversed the sluggishness of the previous day. After opening at 5.6 million yuan per ten taels, amid widespread buying from brokers, it reached the limit up of 5.68 million yuan around 9:36-37 AM, and trading was suspended. Later, due to retail investors selling at high prices, the price softened, fluctuating between 6.55 million and 6.57 million yuan. By 11:30 AM, the price rose again, with reports of sales exceeding the limit-up price of 5.68 million yuan, but no transactions occurred. At the same time, the Central Bank began to entrust Dadecheng to sell at high prices at 5.64 million yuan, and the market price settled at 5.64 million.</p>
<p>Subsequently, due to the Central Bank's large-scale sales, some brokers lowered their bids to seek purchases, once bidding as low as 5.6 million yuan, but no transactions occurred. Eventually, due to bullish sentiment, the price gradually rebounded to 5.635 million yuan at 11:58 AM, and continued to fluctuate without transactions until the noon close. The final price settled at 5.64 million yuan, up 40,000 yuan from the opening price. However, the off-exchange trend was even more pronounced, with the price remaining high without retracement when the exchange price hit the 5.68 million limit up. Around noon, the price was raised to 5.71 million yuan with buying reported.</p>
<p>In summary, although the Central Bank sold a large amount yesterday, it failed to suppress the market due to strong absorption. From the start of sales at 11:30 AM until half an hour before the close, brokers scrambled to absorb the supply, with actual sales of 632 bars, totaling 6,320 taels, and 3.564 billion yuan recovered.</p>
<p>This afternoon, due to regulations requiring spot transactions for the day's positions, there were many concerns, so the trend showed a waxing and waning pattern. It is expected that the money market will stabilize this morning, and the rising trend may be slightly reduced.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] In the afternoon, the on-exchange market opened at 5.89 million, once rising to 5.9 million. Subsequently, major players sold short, and the Central Bank provided covert support, while rumors circulated widely, the boom dissipated, and the market price fell rapidly, all the way down to a closing price of 5.54 million.</p>
<p>The off-exchange market opened at 5.83 million and 5.88 million. After the opening, reports of a stronger on-exchange market bolstered sentiment, and retail investors enthusiastically re-entered, pushing the price up to 5.85 million and 5.9 million. Subsequently, the price fell all the way back down, with the evening close at 5.61 million and 5.64 million.</p>
<p>The US dollar opened this morning at 11,400 yuan and 11,500 yuan, closing at noon at 11,500 yuan and 11,600 yuan. In the afternoon, the market opened at 11,700 yuan and 11,800 yuan, and the evening close was 11,300 yuan and 11,400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Money Market Uncertain, Cash Shortage Unresolved, Number of Returned Checks Increases to Unprecedented Levels</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Recently, the money market has been inconsistent, and cash is extremely scarce. As a result of the flood of checks, the percentage of returned checks to exchanged checks at the local check clearing house has reached unprecedented levels in the past week. In particular, the number of returned checks on the 14th reached 4,757, with a returned amount of 1,118,967,470 yuan, accounting for 71% of the day's exchange amount of 156,930,590,042 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 16th, the amount of returned checks was 822,972,219 yuan, accounting for 94% of the day's exchange amount of 167,026,182,151 yuan.</p>
<p>The percentage on the 15th also reached 46%, on the 17th it reached 47%, on the 18th it reached 38%, and on the 19th it reached 26%.</p>
<p>Authorities Investigating Extension of Check Clearing Time</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that the check clearing house automatically extended the clearing time on the 21st, all the way to after business hours on the 22nd, the Gold Control Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate thoroughly. Yesterday, a person in charge of the bureau said that the handling of this matter is currently awaiting a report from the investigators. Once the report is received, a decision will be made on how to handle it.</p>
<p>He also said that it had previously been stipulated that exchanged checks should be delivered no later than 1:30 PM each day. The reason for this delay was said to be due to a shortage of cash and an excess of checks and bank drafts, but the clearing house did not take steps to prevent this situation beforehand, nor did it report it to the bureau afterwards, which was negligent and should be reprimanded. Such a phenomenon will not be allowed to occur again in the future.</p>
<h3>Erratic Money Market</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's money market was quite erratic, but ultimately the authorities maintained a loose situation through large-scale intervention. The initial interbank rate in the morning continued the loose trend from the previous day, fluctuating between 60 and 70 yuan. However, there were still many purchase orders, and the interbank rate fell below 60 yuan, reaching a low of 45 yuan.</p>
<p>After 4:00 PM, the loose trend eased somewhat due to the National Bank's large-scale gold sales. However, with large government treasury disbursements and continued inflows of remittances from other locations, the money market remained fundamentally loose. The final interbank rate was around 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the National Bank and its agencies intervened with an unprecedented 7.39 billion yuan, foreign merchants intervened with over 2.3 billion yuan, and banks in the major clearing house intervened with 3.75 billion yuan, while banks in the smaller clearing house intervened with 5.94 billion yuan.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Bank Association Holds Fourth Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>Welcoming New Members and Electing Standing Committee Members</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Designated Foreign Exchange Bank Association held its fourth annual meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the China Bank Building, 4th floor, welcoming ten new members newly approved by the National Bank to handle foreign exchange. The ten new member companies are: American Commercial, American Express, Central Cooperative Treasury, Guohua, Continental, Hecheng, China Industrial, United, Sichuan Meifeng, and Xinhua. Together with the association's original nineteen members, the total membership has reached twenty-nine. The meeting was chaired by Chen Changtong, representative of the Bank of China. Mr. Chen delivered a report on the association's work over the past year, including financial situation and financial trends.</p>
<p>The election of the members of the standing committee took place and as a result, the following eleven banks were elected: China, Jiaotong, Banque de l'Indochine, Mercantile, Chase, Zhejiang First, Zhongxing, HSBC, Jin Cheng, Citibank, Shanghai.</p>
<p>The standing committee in turn chose members to the executive committee: China, Jiaotong, Citibank, Shanghai, Mercantile. Finally Jiaotong and Citibank were elected as vice chairmen, and Mercantile was elected as secretary. (According to the regulations of the association, the chairman and honorary secretary are permanently held by China and Shanghai Banks respectively.)</p>
<p>The meeting also passed a telegram to congratulate the new finance minister, Liu Gongyun, expressing our determination to fully support and cooperate in future financial stability and trade development. Wheelock shares bought at 60,000 yuan with no sell orders heard, the rest were mediocre. Gold public bonds opened in the morning at 350,000, following the rising trend in the gold market to 365,000, and the price came back down slightly in the afternoon closing at 350,000. A brief trade occurred at 350,000 in the afternoon with only two taels traded, with no further offers.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Rises, Fabric Market Rebounds and Fluctuates</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market has become strong again. The money market has loosened, and because the gold price hit the limit-up, the market sentiment has been bolstered. The purchase appetite is now strong, and there are many short covering trades.</p>
<p>In the morning, the initial price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was at the 4 million mark, but ultimately the high levels led to abundant selling from retail investors, and the market became weaker in the middle of the day, once reaching only 3.95 million yuan. At the close, short covering trades caused the price to rise back to 3.97 million yuan, up 240,000 yuan from the previous day. The 40-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose 200,000 yuan, while the 32-count Silver Moon yarn declined from 2.7 million yuan to 2.655 million yuan, ultimately rising by 100,500 yuan.</p>
<p>The 21-count Double Horse yarn initially opened at 1.99 million yuan, then jumped over 2 million, followed by a decline to 1.95 million yuan, and finally rose back to the opening price of 1.99 million yuan at the close, up 100,000 yuan. Factory orders and spot prices were even. The 20-count Double Horse yarn rose 90,000 yuan to close at 1.89 million yuan at noon. Other yarns, such as Golden City and Celestial Maiden, all initially opened close to the high levels, but showed declines at the close. Lower grades of 16-count yarn also followed the upward trend.</p>
<p>The fabric market fluctuated at high levels, and shipments to various regions remained limited. Business in the local market was also slow, and market sentiment was difficult to be optimistic. Although various fabrics rose by half a percentage point, this was not enough to cover one day's interest, so there were very few direct sales in the market, and only trading on the tables occurred.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth became more active due to the reopening of sales by Fangjian the previous day, and the amount of stock in the market increased. It opened at 83,500 yuan, reached a high of 86,500 yuan, and fell to 80,700 yuan near noon, finally settling at 83,800 yuan, up 3,800 yuan. The price of Labatong fine cloth rose by 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Four Gentlemen yuan beige opened at 77,000 yuan and then fell to 76,200 yuan, once approaching the 80,000 yuan mark. The closing price was back to 78,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan from the previous day. The Golden Luck Wonderful Dance yuan beige finally closed at 77,000 yuan, also up 5,000 yuan. In addition, factory prices for popular items, such as poplin, floral cloth, and Hanslin, increased by half a percentage point to 10%, while the prices of most other fabrics remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Stop Rising and Fall, Flour Prices Fluctuate Slightly, Oil Market Sentiment Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Rice prices were stable in the Nanshi market and fell in the Beishi market yesterday. The rice prices in the Nanshi market also fell at the opening, but when the news of the gold price hitting its upper limit came to the market, market sentiment was greatly shaken. The sellers raised prices, and the market eventually rebounded, closing at the same level as the previous day, with a slight increase of 500 yuan. The Beishi market fell slightly by 2,000 to 2,500 yuan, as the price had risen too much the previous day. White japonica rice was 62,500 yuan, and special japonica rice was 66,000 yuan. The total volume of goods arriving in the two markets was 4,706 shi.</p>
<p>Edible Oil prices show no sign of stopping rising. The loose money supply, rising gold prices, and strong market sentiment have all contributed. The market opened strong and closed slightly weaker. Soybean oil ultimately saw a sharp increase of 14,000 yuan, with a closing price of 268,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil was 249,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. A barrel of auspicious rapeseed oil was 365,000 yuan, an increase of more than 20,000 yuan. The soybean cake market had no sales and the market was very weak.</p>
<p>Flour initially rose and then fell, with not much difference from the previous day. Initially, it was heard that the price of gold and banknotes was rising sharply and the money supply was very loose. The northern merchants were very strong in buying, and the factories did not sell much, so market sentiment was bullish. The morning opening price for various brands of flour all rose by 1,000 yuan. In the middle of the day, it was heard that the National Bank was selling, and market sentiment was weak, so the market became unsustainable and gradually declined. The price for old vehicles fell to 22,200 yuan, and the price for warship fell to 21,380 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains saw mixed results. Soybeans initially rose and then fell, while raw peanuts were in short supply and rose by another 10%. Yangzhou Tizhuang rose to 194,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were stable, red sorghum rose slightly by 2,000 yuan, and corn had weak appetite and declined by more than 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll: Onlooker's Commentary</h3>
<p>Although the Estimated Issuance Volume Is Accurate, It's Wrong One Minute Later: Small Increases Are Allowed, Big Increases Are Suppressed, and a General Wave Is Approaching</p>
<p>Now running through the market, one only sees an atmosphere of confusion and hesitation.</p>
<p>The amount of Gold Yuan issued, some say 600 billion, some say 1 trillion out of customs, these estimates, even if correct, only last for one minute. The next minute, who knows how many hundreds of millions more will be issued.</p>
<p>The other side of poor sales is the lack of supply. If the two sides are linked, the problem lies in local factors. Paper money floods, and interest accumulates, so it will rise even if it doesn't want to. But with eyes to see and ears to hear, the sounds of the drums are yet another matter.</p>
<p>Receiving paper money makes you unable to sleep, and buying goods weighs on your mind. Thinking it over and over, it's difficult on both sides, so the idea turns to gold, US dollars, and silver dollars that can be carried and stored. But once the wind is tight and the rain is heavy, rice and coal are more important.</p>
<p>Rice comes from the countryside, and coal comes from the north. If they can't come, you still have to eat and burn them. So, insure yourself as much as possible. Whether it's for one month or three months. And so emerges the phenomenon of the "all withered, only one thrives" among the various industries.</p>
<p>"All withered, only one thrives" is by no means normal, so sooner or later, they will all gradually catch up. A universal wave is likely to occur within the next few days.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning there was a small movement, and the Central Bank used its force. In the evening there was another small movement, so let's see how much strength the Central Bank has today. The Central Bank should remember Mr. Bei Zuyi's secret: when there is a small increase, either let it go or incite it to rise even more. Once everyone is caught up in the rising wind, come up with a sudden attack and hit everyone so hard that they can't breathe.</p>
<p>Recently, the Central Bank has often used foreign exchange transfer certificates to provoke rising winds, and then comes the head-on blow. This method only works on seasoned speculators, and ordinary people are easily caught up in the market atmosphere, so it always works.</p>
<p>It is also for this reason that experienced speculators take advantage of the sober to profit from those who are dizzy. And most of those who are dizzy are retail investors, who don't have enough strength, so they collapse as soon as there is a rush, are tripped up by high interest rates, and the Central Bank takes advantage of the situation with a blow, and the effect is immediately seen. Once the effect is seen, experienced speculators rush to cover their positions, and the Central Bank lags behind, inevitably suffering a loss.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Rise Slightly, Gold Prices Mediocre</h3>
<p>The foreign stock market was initially high and then low yesterday. Initially, the market sentiment was still strong due to loose money, but then the market softened slightly as floating retail investors sold at high prices. Jardine Matheson saw some trades at 15,400 yuan, up 100 yuan. The closing prices of British American Tobacco and San Miguel were mixed, and Tsingtao Brewery rose nicely at 2,900 yuan and 3,100 yuan, while Jardine Wright rose nicely at 5,800 yuan and 6,100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Certificates Rise Sharply Again, Closing at 10,009 Yuan</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange transfer certificates rose sharply again yesterday (23rd) following the rise in gold and banknotes. The market opened at 10,300 yuan, and importers immediately bought heavily. The market then reached a new high of 11,000 yuan. Major players took profits and sold, and the market closed slightly softer at 10,900 yuan, up 700 yuan from the closing price the previous day (22nd).</p>
<h3>Military and Government Expenditures Require More Cash, Bank Withdrawals Are Restricted Again</h3>
<p>Although the cash shortage has improved slightly since the beginning of this week, with bank withdrawals increasing to 12% on the previous day (22nd), yesterday, due to excessive cash requirements for government treasury expenditures, the bank withdrawal limit was reduced to 10%.</p>
<p>It is understood that the National Bank withdrew approximately 1.5 billion yuan in cash from various banks yesterday, and it is expected that it will be difficult to fully supply the market within the day.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Flat and Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market saw a looser money supply and sluggish sales. There was more selling than buying, and holding goods was not as profitable as earning interest, so market sentiment was very weak. When the rumor of a Zhongxin Bureau sale was heard, the market became quiet, and the market price declined after opening.</p>
<p>120 Heavenly Bridge Spot was 2.4 million yuan, slightly higher by 100,000 yuan after the opening. Subsequently, the supply became abundant, and the market price fell to 2.37 million yuan. The closing price for the morning was 2.4 million yuan. Overnight positions traded at 2.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the gold price declined, market sentiment weakened, and asking prices continued to decline. The initial asking price was 2.45 million yuan, once falling to 2.37 million yuan. The final price was 2.42 million yuan.</p>
<p>Raw Silk With the continued rise in prices of foreign exchange certificates and strong gold prices, market sentiment was slightly better. The price of standard grade was initially 3.6 million yuan, rose as high as 3.7 million yuan, but then fell back down to 3.62 million yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Silk and Satin Dachen Fabric opened in the morning at 1.68 million yuan. After the opening, the buying interest was still strong, and the price rose as high as 1.77 million yuan. The market immediately sold at high prices, and the price fell back down to 1.68 million yuan. The market sentiment improved at noon, and the market price rebounded, again closing at 1.77 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Exports Active</h3>
<p>It is understood that the market for silkworm cocoons in Zhejiang is currently quite good. Each dan can be sold for 100 yuan in transfer certificates. Also, the selling price of raw silk overseas is once higher than the price of raw silk.</p>
<h3>Threat of Selling Gold Is Too Great, Chinese Stocks Rebound Sharply After Rising</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market yesterday stopped its decline and turned to rise. The market was initially high and then low. The long and short targets within the circle were different, and their views varied. However, because the short selling force was still strong, the peak only appeared briefly and passed. There were reports that a new cabinet was formed, and peace was expected, which slightly boosted market sentiment. However, the threat of selling gold was significant, the control of money supply was uncertain, and high interest rates prevailed in the market, which also made the bulls disheartened. The short sellers were active, and the future of the stock market was still uncertain.</p>
<p>The price of Yongsha in the morning was initially high, because the money supply was still loose, and also because the gold price rose, which bolstered market sentiment. The morning opened at 7 yuan and 3 jiao, and the market trend was stable after the opening. Various groups were strong in their intention to buy, and the price rose to 7 yuan and 6 jiao and 7 fen. Securities brokers and flower yarn brokers sold, and the price fell to 7 yuan and 5 jiao and 3 fen. Financial brokers forcefully absorbed, and the price rose to 7 yuan and 6 jiao and 1 fen. Later, it was heard that the Central Bank was selling gold, and gold merchants, in order to square their positions, collectively sold aggressively, and market sentiment was timid. Floating bulls became anxious, and a soft wind arose in the market. The market price plunged all the way down to 6 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen. After the low, short sellers covered, and the price rebounded, but with heavy fluctuations, market sentiment was depressed, and the soft state remained. The price finally closed at 7 yuan and 2 jiao and 8 fen at noon.</p>
<p>The opening trend of small and medium-sized stocks in the morning was good, but in the middle of the day, because Yongsha fell sharply, market sentiment softened, and the market also showed a tired color. The opening price of Xinguang in the morning was 7 jiao and 3 fen, once rising to 8 jiao and 1 fen, and the closing price at noon was 8 jiao and 05 fen. The opening price of Jingfu was 2 jiao and 9 fen, reaching as high as 3 jiao and 1 fen, and the noon closing price was still at the original level. The price of Qinxing was initially offered at 3 jiao and 8 fen, reaching as high as 4 jiao and 1 fen and 5 li, and the closing price at noon was 3 jiao and 9 fen and 5 li. The price of Meya was 2 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen, rising to 2 yuan and 3 jiao after the opening, and then closing at 2 yuan and 3 jiao and 2 fen at noon. The prices of gold and silver stocks were stable, with a trading volume of 4.22635 billion shares.</p>

<p>In the medicinal materials market, the weather has cleared, and local medicinal slice merchants are replenishing supplies of Radix Ligustici Chuanxiong (Chuanxiong), with many customers from Jiáxiá also present. As a result, prices have risen, with Fǔjí Chuanxiong at 4,500 yuan, Chuanxiong Wang at 4,000 yuan, and Diāo Chuanxiong at 3,600 yuan. Bezoar and musk are being added to prescriptions for medicinal slices, and demand for medicines for feverish diseases is gradually increasing. Industry insiders say that the inventory in Shanghai is low, and incoming goods are scarce, raising concerns about potential shortages. The price has risen to 260,000 yuan, equivalent to only around 37 silver dollars at the current market price. The purchase price at the place of origin is close to breakeven, without covering shipping costs, so prices need to be raised further.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Tactics</h3>
<p>— Translated by Qi Gong</p>
<p>(2) (Please refer to Diagram 12) This method is related to the second method. If three attackers are used to pressure the defenders in a certain area, the attackers and the defenders in the backcourt are positioned as shown in the diagram above. The center defender guards the central area, watching for the opponent's long-distance passes over the backcourt. A more rigorous full-movement method is shown in (Diagram 13). In the backcourt, the center defender is adjusted to stand at the center line to guard. She must watch the movement of the ball and roam to the left and right. The other two defenders guard the attackers in the backcourt. If the center forward believes that the attackers in the frontcourt are unable to prevent the opponent's defenders from passing the ball over the backcourt, the center defender should immediately retreat to guard her original position.</p>
<p>So, how should one respond when throwing the ball inbounds? This is not difficult. If the ball is thrown inbounds in the east zone, the defender closest to that area should move forward to the sideline to guard. The other two defenders should hold their positions. After the thrower has thrown the ball into the court, the defender must immediately retreat to guard her original position. The movement method is as shown in the initial diagram.</p>
<p>If the opponent's attackers are throwing the ball inbounds under the basket, the defenders should switch to a man-to-man defense until the ball has been passed out of the keyhole circle, after which the defenders should quickly return to the original zone defense. Therefore, the defenders must often discuss how to deal with the attackers to form close coordination.</p>
<p>If the defenders gain possession of the ball, they naturally switch from defense to offense. In this case, the zone defense is abandoned. The defenders should try to pass the ball to each other along the sidelines, making sure to pass the ball to the attackers in the frontcourt. Diagrams 11, 12, and 13 show how the defenders keep the ball in their hands and the defenders' passing routes.</p>
<p>The ultimate conclusion is that a moving zone defense relies on the intelligence of the defenders, precise positioning, close cooperation, and agile movement to be effective. In terms of player selection, the best and tallest defenders should take on the important position of center defender. The most important skill is the ability to move quickly.</p>
<p>The zone defense does not produce results after just one day of practice. It also depends on the players' habits and personalities. This must be done quickly. If the team finds it effective, they may continue to use it.</p>

<h3>Ye Guanxiong Defeats Xiao Xu; A Good Tennis Match in Hong Kong This Year</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong, 23rd Dispatch] The first public grass tennis singles semi-final of the year was completed on the 22nd in front of a full crowd. Xiao Xu narrowly lost in straight sets (3-6, 6-8, 5-7) to Ye Guanxiong. However, I must admit that his performance was his best ever. Facing a younger opponent who was slightly superior in skill, he should have lost, but in his defeat, he served ten aces and broke Ye’s "set point" six times. Although only three sets were played, the match lasted one hour and twenty-five minutes, which was more intense than the usual five-set match. One can imagine how exciting it was at the time. After this performance, I am confident that Ye Guanxiong will once again win this year’s singles championship.</p>
<p>Xu Runpei knew that a formidable opponent was in front of him and that old habits die hard. His skills tend to improve as the match progresses. As expected, Ye Guanxiong won the first game after getting the first serve. After reaching a tie, Ye won the game. In the second game, Xiao Xu took advantage of his serve to win four points in a row, taking a clean victory. Then, Ye took a 3-1 lead, followed by Xiao Xu closing the gap to 2-3. In the end, after 17 minutes, Ye Guanxiong won the first set 6-3. Xiao Xu won the second, fifth, and eighth games. This set was dominated by Ye, who served three aces. Xiao Xu made a double fault in the fourth game.</p>
<p>Second set</p>
<p>In the second set, Xiao Xu served first, and after two ties, he lost to Ye. But at this point, Xiao Xu's level gradually showed, and he quickly won two consecutive games, taking the lead for the first time at 2-1. However, Ye chased back to a 2-2 tie and was never able to take the lead again. He trailed 3-3 and then 3-5. The most wonderful part was the ninth game, in which Ye made two successful kill shots, but Xiao Xu took it step by step, not only retaking the lead after a tie but also serving an ace for the second time after the second tie, regaining a 4-5 situation. In the tenth game, Ye had a 40-15 advantage, and everyone thought Xiao Xu would lose 4-6, but Xiao Xu suddenly saved two set points in a row and then saved another set point after the second tie, finally reaching a 5-5 tie amidst thunderous applause. In the thirteenth game, Xiao Xu served two aces, but his strength was gradually failing, and he was defeated by Ye, who took the lead at 7-6. In the fourteenth game, Ye suddenly played aggressively, using both short and long shots, and gained a clean victory, winning the second set again 8-6. This set lasted 43 minutes, which is equivalent to the time of two ordinary sets. Xiao Xu had three aces, and Ye had no aces.</p>
<p>Third set</p>
<p>In the third set, Xiao Xu initially seemed to be lacking in strength, losing the first game cleanly. He only won one point in the second game and took back two points in the third game, losing three games in a row. But from the fourth game onwards, Xiao Xu suddenly recovered and often made excellent shots, winning four games in a row and taking the lead for the second time at 4-3. In these four games, even Ye Guanxiong, as strong as he was, could only take back four points. Ye even submitted a blank sheet in the seventh game, which shows how powerful Xiao Xu was at that time. Unfortunately, good times don't last long. After being chased back to a 4-4 tie by Ye, Xiao Xu could only win one more game, taking the lead for the third time at 5-4, before collapsing completely and quickly losing three games, allowing Ye to win 7-5. Xiao Xu's overall situation collapsed, and this set took 24 minutes to complete at 5:55 PM. In this set, Xiao Xu "received aces" seven times and had "double faults" twice. Ye had "aces" four times. Ye never made a single "unforced error" in the whole match, which shows that Ye's skills have improved even further.</p>
<p>If calculated by points, Ye scored 29 points and Xu scored 20 points in the first set. In the second set, Ye scored 60 points and Xu scored 50 points. The closest was the third set, with Ye scoring 34 points and Xu scoring 30 points. The total for the whole match was 123 points for Ye and just 100 points for Xu, which is a magnificent spectacle.</p>

<h3>"Pearl of Malaya": Wong Peng Soon's Glorious Battle History</h3>
<p>[Singapore Dispatch] Being able to win the world badminton individual championship is certainly great, but giving up all possibilities of winning this laurel and contributing the most to Malaya to enable Malaya to win the prestigious Thomas Cup is even more commendable. The former is the American badminton prodigy Freeman, and the latter is Malaya’s Wong Peng Soon.</p>
<p>Wong Peng Soon played in eight matches in the Thomas Cup semi-finals and finals representing the Malayan team, winning seven and losing one.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Wong Peng Soon would never conserve his energy for the sake of others' honors, preparing to defeat America's Freeman in the All-England Badminton Singles and win the All-England Singles Championship, which symbolizes the world men's badminton singles title. Recalling the semi-finals between Malaya and America in Scotland, Wong Peng Soon took the lead and exhausted all his abilities to defeat America's second-ranked player Varges. Wong Peng Soon's victory was of great importance in establishing the Malayan badminton team's victory. Otherwise, the situation would have been difficult to predict. Recalling the Malaya-Denmark final, Wong Peng Soon again fulfilled his greatest responsibility, defeating Denmark's champion Scalopp, who dominated Europe, and smoothly enabling Malaya to ascend to the throne of the world's badminton kingdom. I remember when Wong Peng Soon defeated Mr. Scalopp in the Malaya-Denmark final in Preston, the 2,000 spectators in the audience stood up spontaneously and applauded enthusiastically for the exhausted Wong Peng Soon. Looking at the entire process of the Thomas Cup, no athlete received the same praise as Wong Peng Soon. Wong Peng Soon is the unshakable rock in the Malayan badminton team. Before this rock-like pillar, the American and Danish badminton teams have all bowed down to him one after another.</p>
<p>Indeed, anyone in the world who loves badminton agrees that Wong Peng Soon's efforts for Malaya to win the Thomas Cup are more significant than if he had given up this effort to win the world badminton singles title. Now, let us briefly introduce Wong Peng Soon's history in badminton. Wong Peng Soon is a Penang Chinese, hailed as the "Pearl of Malaya." In his youth, he studied at English schools in Penang. Among sports, he first became involved with baseball, but he also played football and swam, and participated in Boy Scout activities.</p>
<p>It was not until he was fifteen that he started playing badminton, joining the Penang Chio Yang Badminton Club. Initially, Wong Peng Soon seemed to have no particular interest in badminton and no special characteristics. There was even a time when he was demoted to a lower group due to declining performance.</p>
<p>1937 was Wong Peng Soon's "golden year" of today's fame. In this year, Wong left the Chio Yang Badminton Club and joined the prestigious Linstead Badminton Club in Penang. In this year, Wong Peng Soon began to show his abilities in Penang. In the Penang Open Badminton Championships held in the same year, Wong Peng Soon passed one level after another, only to be eliminated in the semi-finals.</p>
<p>The following year (1938), Wong Peng Soon seemed to change his strategy, giving up competing for the Penang singles championship and partnering with another player, Chen Genfeng, in doubles. In the doubles arena, Wong Peng Soon indeed fulfilled his wish. In the All Badminton Open Championships, Wong Peng Soon and Chen Genfeng partnered to win three consecutive doubles championships and also won the All-Malaya doubles championship once.</p>
<p>Hard work</p>
<p>Just like many famous people who have achieved ultimate success in their careers, Wong Peng Soon reaps today's harvest only after plowing. Wong Peng Soon has put in a lot of effort in badminton and has indeed practiced hard for several years. Wong Peng Soon has spent at least half an hour practicing various basic postures of hitting and intercepting under the guidance of four badminton coaches.</p>
<p>As an athlete, Wong Peng Soon strictly abides by physiological hygiene in terms of health maintenance. He needs to have adequate sleep before the game, and in the days before the sport, he avoids stimulating foods, even the coffee foods generally preferred by Malayans, which he strictly avoids. His reason is: "If our stomach is on fire, we will definitely not be able to play well."</p>
<p>Technically, Wong Peng Soon has not yet reached perfection. He does not have lightning-fast hitting techniques. His main weapons are dealing with high balls, occasional light drops in front of the net, preparedness, and agile steps. In addition, Wong Peng Soon has another feature, that is, his eyesight is sharp, and he can detect the opponent's weaknesses in tense games. Wong Peng Soon uses this specialty to make Denmark's Scalopp useless. When he fought Scalopp in the Malaya-Denmark final, he changed his offensive route quickly after detecting Scalopp's weaknesses. From attacking Scalopp's backhand to pressing his forehand. In addition, in terms of sportsmanship, Wong Peng Soon has a calm and persevering spirit of combat. In Malaya, Wong Peng Soon used this spirit to defeat Wong Bingsoon. Wong Peng Soon's sportsmanship was again proven in the two games in Scotland and Preston. Many people believed that Wong Peng Soon might have exhausted himself and fallen to the ground in each of the games against Freeman (USA), Mantiez (USA), Phillips Bay (Denmark), and Scalopp, but the opposite was true. Wong Peng Soon not only made Freeman (USA) enter a situation where he had to fight hard to win, but also successively defeated Mantiez, Phillips Bay, and Scalopp in situations where his strength was reduced. In scenes where his strength was gradually exhausted, Wong Peng Soon relied entirely on his confidence to fight. Wong Peng Soon's performance in the Malayan Open over the years is outstanding in Malayan badminton history.</p>
<p>1938: Penang Grade B singles champion, Grade B mixed doubles champion, Penang Open men's doubles champion. First represented Penang to participate in the Malayan Inter-City Games. In the same year, he also won the Penang Open singles and doubles championships. Malayan mixed doubles champion.</p>

<h3>Blood's Hypnosis</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>After a great war, there must be a year of famine. Historically, every dynasty feared war, and even more so, the plagues and famines that followed. In China, this historical lesson should be etched in the minds of our generation. However, based on the many facts before our eyes, the bright red blood left on our land for decades has not only failed to awaken everyone to the vigilance of transformation into jade, but on the contrary, the absolute majority of people have fallen into madness in the bloodshed. Right and wrong, grievances, all depend on bloodshed. Before the greatest plagues and famines fall upon us, we have already used blood as mutual sacrifices. The blood shed by the previous generation has instead become a hypnotic for our generation. Is this truly a tragedy of the times?</p>
<p>The ten days of Yangzhou and the three massacres of Jiading are racial hatreds. The "mopping-up" and "city cleansing" by a branch of the "China Expeditionary Army" only demonstrated the barbarity inflicted upon us by another nation. They were irresistible and unavoidable. But recently, during the Xiangxi civil unrest, why did Yuanling suffer the fate of nine out of ten houses being empty? For "the people" to "rebel," there must be hidden pains and sufferings. However, the government belongs to us, and we can accuse and appeal. And if Xiangxi feels pain, how can Yuanling be an exception? Being in the same province, "the people's" interests are the same. Why must the minority who "rebel" subject the majority to the ax?</p>
<p>The discovery of a "boxed corpse" at the North Station was followed by a "bagged corpse" on Xietu Road in less than two weeks. In between, we can see the murderer's techniques have significantly improved. The dismemberment of the corpse has progressed from eight pieces to thirty-two segments. Whether this case involves a love affair, money, or revenge, why must the murderer display the cruelty of human nature to such an extent? Is it inspired by the times? Or does it indicate the extinction of spirituality? It truly makes one unable to bear thinking about it.</p>
<p>The Western heroes of the uncivilized American West also relied on blood to avenge grievances. But they dealt with enemies with only a bullet, a fist, or a kick. Even if Native Americans wanted to eliminate an outsider, it was limited to a guillotine or a rope. "Slaughtering a village" and "dismembering" would probably seem superfluous to them. But in China, it's not like that. It is still flourishing. As a child, listening to elders talk about the past deeds of Zhang Xianzhong and Li Chuang already made one's hair stand on end and filled one with lingering fear. Unexpectedly, such events have reappeared before our eyes. Would you believe that history is progressing?</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw someone reading a newspaper in a restaurant. Perhaps the dismembered corpse case triggered a reaction in his conscience. He said to another companion: "This murderer is too ruthless! Look..." Unexpectedly, this companion replied coldly: "Brother, you are truly making a fuss over nothing. This is how it is these days. How many people die on the battlefield every day?" At this time and place, it proves that human compassion and self-awareness have been diluted clean by interest-bearing banknotes.</p>
<p>After a great war, there must be a year of famine. Blood is ultimately not the most auspicious thing. We should be terrified by the lessons of blood. We oppose being subjected to the hypnosis of blood.</p>
<h3>This Precedent</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuozhi</p>
<p>I heard that the price of set meals will be based on the price of rice, divided into three levels: 2.5 *sheng*, 2 *sheng*, and 1.3 *sheng*. Because I have to leave the company and eat set meals at nearby restaurants every day except Sunday, rain or shine, all year round, I was particularly surprised to hear this news.</p>
<p>Of course, restaurant owners are very shrewd. Even if a vegetable dish is mixed with a dozen shreds of meat, they will definitely classify it as "Grade A" set meal without mercy. This is secondary. The wonderful thing is that the price of rice may increase at any time, especially when the market report is announced at noon. Then, the story of suddenly increasing the price halfway through the meal, resulting in insufficient money in the pocket to pay the bill, will really come true.</p>
<p>In fact, using rice as a standard is not the most reliable. Because a set meal only includes two small bowls of white rice. In addition, there is a pot of vegetables and a bowl of "Pacific soup." The soup is best based on the market price of soy sauce, let alone. This dish should obviously be based on meat, such as divided into three levels: one *jin* of meat, eight *liang* of meat, four *liang* of meat, etc. Calculated in this way, it becomes complicated, and it seems that a "set meal index" that is adjusted daily must be compiled.</p>
<p>After all, people who eat set meals are not the majority, not comparable to household rice, so no matter how it is calculated, it is fine. It's just that once this precedent is set, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not trigger imitation, such as hairdressing, laundry, trams, buses, etc., can also rise up and demand to be calculated based on the rice price of the day. Then the Gold Yuan Certificate, which is the only legal currency, will be greatly impacted once again.</p>
<p>Precedents cannot be easily set; because once a precedent is set, it is difficult to take it back.</p>

<h3>Casual Talk</h3>
<p>— Cang Yi</p>
<p>Mangoes, which are produced in Malaysia, the Philippines, India, and other places, have a long history of four thousand years. Residents of the tropics love to eat this kind of thing. Mangoes produced in Brazil, South America, can be as large as twenty-five feet in circumference and seventy feet high, with fruits weighing up to five *jin*.</p>

<h3>Han Tombs in Shaoxing</h3>
<p>— Guan Zhou</p>
<p>It was reported the other day that a Han tomb was discovered in Changzhou, and residents flocked to see it, causing a sensation. But this is commonplace for residents in the southeastern mountains of Shaoxing, and they are not surprised at all.</p>
<p>As early as March of the 25th year of the Republic of China, Han tombs were discovered in Shaoxing. The author wrote an article "Han Tombs of Shaoxing" in this newspaper in the 29th year of the Republic of China, recounting the matter. There are many small mountains in the southeastern region of Shaoxing, such as Nanchi, Pingshui, Shangzao, etc., and there are many Han tombs, with no less than two or three thousand unearthed successively, of varying sizes. Small tombs are shaped like large trucks, and burial objects are located at the front of the truck. Villagers are especially careful when excavating this part to avoid breaking porcelain and other objects with hoes. Large tombs have two or three chambers (the one discovered in Changzhou is probably a large tomb), and the chambers are mostly silted up with mud, which makes excavation quite labor-intensive.</p>
<p>After August 13th, the trend of digging ancient tombs became very popular. Villagers called it "panning for ancient tombs," and every tomb was bound to yield something. So antique dealers in Shanghai often sent people to be stationed in the countryside to buy unearthed objects at low prices. However, in the eyes of the villagers, it was still profitable, and they regarded it as a way to make money, so they used it as a side business during the slack season. Later, the county government issued a notice prohibiting it, and violators would be detained. So this work of stealing and digging was held at night. The author once saw them joyfully panning for gold in the ancient tombs at night.</p>
<p>Unearthed antiques include pottery, bronze ware, and iron ware, but there are not many jade objects. Fortunately, they are cheap, and I also bought a lot, which are still preserved today. Pottery such as basins (with protruding zodiac images on the edges), flower pots, water basins, and human figures have different shapes from the current pottery. Bronze ware is the most valuable, especially bronze mirrors, which are most liked by antique dealers. Because they have been buried in the soil for many years, their color has turned black, like black gold. The large ones are four or five inches in diameter, and there are also zodiac signs on the back. (This object is also preserved in the museum on Museum Road in this city).</p>
<p>The tomb bricks are extremely large and heavy, and occasionally there are words on the edges, but there are not many. Those without words are worthless, and those with words are worth a little, such as "Jiaping third year" on one side and "made by so-and-so" on the other. Others such as Phoenix first year, Yellow Dragon first year, Chiwu, Taikang, Yonghe, etc. I checked the chronological table of major events in past dynasties, and they are mostly the reign names of emperors in the Three Kingdoms period and before and after the Three Kingdoms period. (For example, a Phoenix first year brick I own, which I checked is the reign name of Sun Quan). No skeletons have ever been found in the tomb, let alone coffins. Probably because over the years, the people and the wood have rotted away.</p>
<p>Why are the most Han and Jin ancient tombs found in Shaoxing? It is said that because Kuaiji was prosperous in culture and relics during the Three Kingdoms period, literati and refined scholars such as Wang Xizhi moved to Yue to live, so Yang Shie has the saying "Osmanthus blossoms for the first time on the Shanyin road, and the Wang and Xie families are full of Jin and Wu's elegance."</p>
<h3>Such as Protecting National Elementary Schools (Oil Painting)</h3>

<p>("Education first," "nation-building first," slogans are very nice to hear, but what we see are just two dilapidated houses, a crooked flagpole, and twenty or thirty pale and skinny pitiful students.)</p>
<h3>Eisenhower and the "Chongqing" Battleship</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>The "Chongqing" is finished. Such an ending is really regrettable. Now, recalling its glorious achievements in World War II is really unbearable!</p>
<p>Many people are tracing its heroic battles with Italian warships, saying that it once had the nickname "Silver Light Ghost," and that it later served as the British king's yacht... But they do not know that the Supreme Commanders of the United Nations once took the lead on this light cruiser, braving the enemy's artillery fire, showing unparalleled composure and courage.</p>
<p>On June 6, 1943, just as the Sicilian landings were about to begin, the crew and sailors of the "Chongqing" were suddenly nervous, because several distinguished guests suddenly came to the ship, and this warship was obviously going to be assigned an important task. What task? No one knew.</p>
<p>The two most important of these distinguished guests were: Allied Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower (then only a four-star general), and then Allied Naval Commander Admiral Kirk.</p>
<p>At five o'clock in the dawn on June 7, Captain Agnew was ordered to broadcast to the entire ship, saying, "The air and sea forces are about to attack the Pantelleria military port in the southern end of Sicily. Four cruisers and eight destroyers will participate in this battle. This ship will go to observe the battle." Admiral Kirk roared: "We will not observe the battle. I will take responsibility!"</p>
<p>He immediately issued several orders to his aides. The "Zhendan" immediately changed all the preparations for "observing the battle" and prepared to "participate in the battle."</p>
<p>At 10:30 a.m., it arrived at Liudi Pan Port. The "Zhendan" accelerated its speed, leading all the participating warships, taking the lead, but the artillery fire on the shore was unusually silent. The "Zhendan" returned to the ship and advanced towards the coast in a curved direction, but the other side did not fire. In the blink of an eye, a large number of British dive bombers appeared, raining down bombs on the coastal defense positions. When the smoke rose, the "Zhendan" ship shuddered, and nine cannons fired in unison. At the same time, the ship moved forward slowly, cooperating with other warships, and arrived at the front of the targets of each ship's attack. The sound of artillery continued, and the "Zhendan's" cannon hit the breakwater along the coast, and then fired two hundred yards to the left, shattering the Pantelleria shipyard.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes after the shelling, the destroyers advanced rapidly to a place two thousand yards from the shore. The artillery fire of the coastal defense forces also became active, and shells fell on the sea surface three hundred yards from the starboard side of the "Zhendan."</p>
<p>There was another burst of heavy artillery fire on the shore, and General Eisenhower suddenly felt a huge shock on the ship, and thought that this time he had been hit. But when he calmed down, he knew that it was the "Zhendan" firing another salvo.</p>
<p>Eisenhower calculated on the ship that if he fought like this, plus five days of air raids, the morale of the Pantelleria garrison would probably be unbearable, so he decided: A general attack on Pantelleria at noon on June 11.</p>
<p>At noon, the "Zhendan" ship returned in complete victory, without any casualties. The only loss was that Admiral Kirk's medal on his chest was shaken off and fell into the sea.</p>
<p>However, on June 11, the "Zhendan" ship did not participate in the general attack, because at noon that day, Admiral Kirk received a telegram. When he gave this telegram to Eisenhower, Eisenhower smiled. The text of the telegram was: "Pantelleria Port has surrendered."</p>
