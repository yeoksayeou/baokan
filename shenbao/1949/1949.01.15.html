<h3 id="c1">毛澤東正式發表聲明　提出和談八項條件　政府方面正詳加研究中 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十四日廣播：中國共產黨廣播電臺十四日正式發表中共中央委員會主席毛澤東一月十二日簽署之時局聲明，第一次提出和平談判條件八項。此一聲明全文共長一千五百餘字，其八項條件爲：（一）懲辦戰犯，（二）廢除現有憲法，（三）廢除現有法統，（四）依據民主原則，改編一切政府軍隊，（五）沒收官僚資本，（六）改革土地制度，（七）廢除「賣國」條約，（八）召開沒有「反動份子」參加的政治協商會議，成立民主聯合政府，接收國民黨政府及地方政府的一切權力。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十四日廣播：據中國共產黨電臺十四日廣播稱：中共領袖毛澤東今日以中共中央委員會主席名義，發表時局聲明，首先攻擊政府及美國，謂應負內戰之全責。該聲明首稱：「自一九四六年七月，南京國民黨反動政府，在美國帝國主義奢的帮助之下，違背人民意志，撕毀停戰協定和政協會議的決議，發動全國規模的內戰以來，業已兩年有半。在這兩年半戰爭中，南京國民然政府，違背民意，召集僞國民大會，頒布僞憲法，選舉僞總統，頒布所謂動員戡亂的僞法令，並且出賣國家利益給美國，勾引美國的海軍空軍，佔據中國的領海領空，簽訂大批的賣國條約，勾引美國軍事顧問團參加內戰，自美國得到飛機·大砲·步槍·砲彈以及一切軍用物資，用來屠殺人民，壓迫人民。南京政府在賣國的內政外交基礎上，指揮其數百萬軍隊，對人民解放軍大舉進攻，東北，華北，華中等地人民，無一不受到國軍的蹂躪，延安，張家口，長春，四平……等地的人民，都曾被國軍搶掠之殘殺，他們壓迫各地各界的廣大人民，出錢出糧，充作所謂戡亂之用。國民黨政府並不斷壓迫各民主黨派，及靑年學生的反內戰，反饑餓的正義運動，同時又濫發法幣，使廣大人民臨到破產的地步。所有財富都歸於官僚資本中，陷人民於水深火熟中·國民黨政府決不能逃避發動內戰的完全責任。相反的，中國共產黨自日本投降以後，盡一切努力，要求避免內戰，一九四五年十月，與國民黨進行和談，一九四六年一月簽訂停戰協定，在政協會議上，與國民黨簽訂了共同協定，中共並不斷爲這些協定努力，可惜，這些協定都不被國民黨政府所軍視，竟發動國內戰爭，在這樣情形下，中共不得不爲國家的利益，人民的利益而起來奮鬥，便領導了解放軍，抵抗四百三十萬的國民黨軍隊的進攻，使自己轉弱爲强，收復了一切失地，並佔領了鄭州，徐州……諸大城市，解放軍克服了無比的困難，壯大了自己，現在解放軍無論在數量上，士氣上，裝備上，都比國民黨反動軍隊强，解放軍有充分的理由，充分的把握，可以在不很久的時間以內，完全消滅國民黨殘餘的勢力。只要人民解放軍再作幾次重大攻勢，便可使國民黨殘餘勢力土崩瓦解，歸於消滅。現在國民黨已至不能維持下去的地步了，但是爲了要得到喘息，以便捲士重來，蔣介石總統便在一月一號提出可以和共產黨進行和平談判的建議。中共認爲這建議是虛偽的，因爲建議竟然還要保持偽憲法，僞法統，保障反動軍隊。中共認爲這不是和談條件，這是繼續戰爭的條件。十幾天來，人民雖然渴望和平，但不贊成國民黨所提的虛偽的和平。中共中央在此情形下，發表聲明：中共雖然可以在短期內消滅國民黨殘餘勢力，但爲了迅速結束戰爭，减輕人民痛苦，中共願意和南京反動政府及其他地方政府，軍事集團，在八大條件（見另條）下進行和平談判。中共認爲，這些條件反映全國人民的公意，如南京政府中人們眞要和平而不是騙局，不虛偽號召，便應放棄其虛偽的條件，實現中共所提的八個條件。希望全國人民民主黨派，起來爲爭取民主的和平。此外，請人民解放軍全體戰鬥員在意：在民主之和平條件未被南京政府實現以前，你們絕不應稍稍鬆懈你們的戰鬥努力！中共中央委會主席毛澤東，一九四九年一月十二日」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕中共電台十四日廣播毛澤東對時局之聲明，業經傳抵首都，惟截至十四日夜，政界人士尚未及獲見聲明全文，故未作正面之評論，惟就該聲明之要點觀察，共方旣謂仍可與政府方面談判，似和平之門並未關閉。惟同時亦有另一觀感，係就共方所提八條件之第一條懲辦戰犯及第八條召開政協，而拒絕所謂反動份子參觀之，顯令人懷疑其是否具有和談誠意也，刻政府及各有關方面正就中共廣播內容詳加研究中。</p>
<h3 id="c2">招待武漢各界茶會　白崇禧槪述時局　勉勵華中軍民備戰謀和 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社漢口十四日電〕華中剿匪總司令白崇禧十四日在政委會大禮堂邀請武漢各機關團體首長，留鄂立監委及士紳等舉行茶會，到百五十餘人，首由白氏就目前局勢提出概略報告，旋由孔庚·余拯·徐會之·夏光宇。艾毓英等發表意見，五時餘散會。白氏在茶會席上致詞如次：</p>
<p>各位先生，黨政軍各界首長，近月以來，崇禧因息氣管炎，身體不適，至今尚未全愈，致未能與各位見面談話，近來時局正醖　和平，大家最關心的，便是時局問題，尤其當此大局轉捩時期，謠言蜂起，引起一般人的惶惑不安，實足動搖精神與意志，或則以爲和平卽將實現，可以歸馬放牛，過分樂觀，表現意志鬆懈。相反的，則消極悲觀，似乎大難臨頭，陷於失望境地，這兩種心理都欠確，因此今天特邀請各界茶會，藉此機會，就當前局勢一作一概略報告。</p>
<p>自抗戰勝利後，中央政府一本和平建設之目標，以求實現民主憲政，建設三民主義的新中國，因此，才有政治協商，由各黨各派共同制定和平建設綱領，期循政治途徑，解決國共紛爭，共同建設富强康樂的中華民國，孰意共信未立，政治協商爲期一年，並無成效，政府迫不得已，不能不採取軍事措施，爲期已有三年，而國家統一和平迄未實現民衆痛苦日益加深。近來各地民意機關爲　求國家安定建設，軍民獲得休養生息，先後自動呼籲和平，主張雙方停戰，聽侯和平會議解決。總統於元旦文告中，復已昭示倡導和平，保全國家元氣，解除人民痛苦，現民衆渴望和平，政府願實現和平，民意與政府朝野上下已趨一致，和平之門業已重開，究竟和平能否實現，其主要關鍵，卽望雙方尊重民意，開誠協商，但至今中共尚未正式明確表示，且對平·津·淮北國軍仍猛烈進攻，對鄂北之襄樊，現正再度進犯，似此情形與舉國民衆希望之和平尚賴各方共盡最大努力，我們必須認淸時局的嚴重性，更須深切了解和平切不可倖致，應確認可戰始可和能戰始能和，應備戰以謀和，勿求和而忘戰，仍應各守崗位，各盡職責，提高警覺，不稍懈怠，無諭時局如何演變，希望我華中軍民上下一心，團結奮鬥，來挽救五千年歷史上未有之艱危，爭取眞正和平的實現。，</p>

<h3 id="c19">從聖地問題說起 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>戰後最感棘手的巴勒斯坦問題，經由聯合國機構處理，已近整整的兩個年頭了。這個問題好像是一束亂麻，愈理愈亂，不僅沒有解開任何一個「死結」，反而使「死結」愈結愈緊，難怪大科學家愛因斯坦要責備聯合國之無能。在去年十一月底，猶阿雙方停戰，聖地恢復和平的希望義濃，但一轉瞬間，忽又發生意外的波折。阿刺伯聯盟內部意見紛歧，外約但要求合併聖地的東部，而埃及叙利亞等國則聯合反對，因此尼基夫的戰火死灰復燃；英國內閣乃決定準備採取軍事行動，兩千英軍即在阿卡巴登岸，以備萬一，同時地中海艦隊也有出動封鎖以色列海岸的傳說。於是中東局勢又趨於緊張！</p>
<p>聖地問題的再起，不僅在英國幾乎引起內閣的軒然大波，貝文外相受人指摘，幾次要掛冠而去；而且在國際間，也幾乎引起英美之間的磨擦。據成功湖畔的聯合國人士的分析，都認爲英美對聖地問題的意見紛歧，或將發展爲英美兩國在中東奪取政治地位的競爭。英國希望外約但能獲得校多的利益，故竭力爲聖地問題覓獲一種有利於外約但的和平解決辦法；而美國則贊成立即停戰，可使埃及取得更多的收穫。所以，在這種國際背境之下，聖地問題更趨錯綜複雜，中東局勢也就更顯示出它的嚴重性了。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦在第一次大戰之後，是自舊國際聯盟移交英國代管的；但在問題的本身，始終沒有解決。迨第二次大戰之後，始由英國於一九四七年四月向聯合國大會提出，並要求下次大會對於巴勒斯坦之未來政府提出建議。首屆聯大便設置一巴勒斯坦問題特別委員會，由十一國代表組成，對聖地問題作初步研究，並向常會隨時提出報告。同年十一月，聯合國第二次大會以三分之二的大多數，通過巴勒斯坦問題特別委員會的建議，主張將巴勒斯坦劃分爲阿刺伯與猶太兩國，在經濟上互相聯繫，並中張聖地耶路撒泠城國際化，由聯合國直接管轄。</p>
<p>這種聖地實行分治的計劃，在理論上本無可厚非的地方；但在實踐上却大成問題。阿刺伯各國首先表示拒絕此種建議；同時，英國對於未獲雙方同意的計劃，也不願負其實施的責任。所以這個問題依舊沒有解決。巴勒斯坦特別委員會乃於一九四八年二月間向安全理事會報告，要求聯合國迅速行動，協助實施此項議案，以免聖地流血。安理會即要求聯大舉行特別會議，商討聖地局勢，結果加派調解專員一人，由瑞典貝納特伯爵担任，親至聖地調解猶阿之間的爭議。但是巴勒斯坦的委任統治至五月十五日卽告終了，猶太人便宜佈以色列國的成立，阿刺伯聯軍由此衝入聖地，於是聖地的戰火爆發。此後雖經安理會迭次呼籲停戰，調解專員的奔走呼號，甚至以身殉職，但是談談打打，打打談談，一直到去年十一月底方透露出一綫和平的曙光，不幸又因意外的波折而歸於幻滅，實在是聖地的不幸，也是全世界的不幸！</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦問題的遷延不決，雖由於猶太人與阿刺伯人的積不相容所致，但觀其發展的經過，不難看出英美對於聖地問題的陷於優局，終難辭其責任。英國雖會宣佈聖地的委任統治已告終了，但仍不忘情於中東，戀戀不捨其在中東旣得的政治地位。而美國對於聖地問題，也始終沒有「堅定不移」的立塲，一忽兒同情猶太人的「復國運動」，一忽兒又怕得罪阿刺伯各國而失去她們的好感，因此出爾反爾，徬徨岐路。在這兩種勢力的矛盾之下，聖地問題自然只有陷於僵局而無法打開了。</p>
<p>此一問題，日來似獲轉機，我們希望英美外交家能放大眼光，應以中東和平爲重，迅速揚棄利己的强權政治，而立即採取外交行動，共謀中東和平的百年大計。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十四日廣播：參院外委會一致通過艾契遜爲國務卿之任命案。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十三日電〕已被任命爲美國國務卿之艾契遜，今日在參院外委會中稱，渠之外交政策與杜發門總統之政策，不致有何重大出入，而渠亦非對蘇妥協者。按艾契遜之出任國務卿，必需參院外委會通過。外委會今日並未公開質詢其所持之外交政策爲何，其原因一則此事與美國利益與安全有關，再則會悉美外交政策將由總統自行釐定。外委會今日請又氏按其過去之經歷，對美國對蘇政策作一全面性之檢討。艾氏並明白表示美國外交政策應由總統決定，總統已明白表示渠無改變外交政策之意。關於其在國務院之經騐，艾氏稱，余自過去服務之經騐，獲悉美國外交政策需要穩健及保持一貫性。渠稱有人認爲余爲對蘇有利者，實則此與余在整個政治生活中所遵奉之原則大相逕庭，余決盡一切可能使國務院不致有企圖顛覆政府之輩滲人。前國務卿史退丁納斯力主參院應通過艾氏之任命案，渠並盛譽艾氏為一聰明睿智之士，必能以全國之榮譽與安全爲其工作之目標。參院外委會主席康納利預料，外委會及參院可望通過艾氏之任命案。</p>

<p>昨日下午一時許，有六十三軍官兵六百餘人，由軍部辦公廳主任鍾偉率領由京來滬，轉搭四十一次滬杭車赴杭，該軍搜索連士兵忽與警備部駐站之特務連士兵發生糾紛，該士兵卽返隊糾集數十士兵，持手溜彈衝至特務連士兵宿舍尋　，其中一人將手溜彈機鈕拉出，擬向頭二等票房口擲下，時北站正值各次車集中待開之時，大廳內排隊等待售票之旅客達數千人。該士兵正擬拋擲手溜彈時，適其少校官長聞訊趕到，奮勇上前將手溜彈奪下，時手溜彈業已冒烟，卽將爆發，該少校在此千鈞一髮之時，輕將手溜彈按放於旅客較少之地，但聞轟然巨聲，數工旅客紛紛奔逃，秩序大亂。出事後統一稽查所黄所長立電報告稽查處長何龍慶，何氏親赴車站彈壓，時肇事士兵業已逃散，何處長當責令該軍領隊鍾偉負貴懲兇。至手溜彈爆炸時，當時有旅客兵工署軍械保養實騐工廠職員葛德民及行李伕兩人，被炸輕傷，原於下午一時十分駛杭之四十一次車，亦延遲至四時一刻始行離滬，六十三軍官兵則搭該次車赴杭云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市一月份之戶口配米，原規定每證十五市斤配價計六十三元，重點配售價格爲四十二元。惟十二日美經合分署美援運用會宣佈，此後計口配糧之價格決改採新辦法，卽每隔兩週或旬日調整一次，十三日復經吳市長說明，可能卽自本月起隨時實施。各區市民聞訊後，連日紛紛趕往配售米店擠購，誰料竟遭多數米店以「配米售完」之理由拒絕出售。記奢昨午後分赴各區巡視，發現每一配售米店門前至少有二三十人以上之擠購行列，但其中有十分之七巳懸出「售完」木牌，羣衆猶竚侯不去。據民食調配處表示：本市一月份各配售米店之配米，業巳撥出五分之三以上，卽去年應補配米亦全救撥完，目前每日仍繼續撥出二萬五千担至三萬担左右，以本市二千家配售店計，每家每日至少可供應配米十担以上，論理各店不致遽行售完，且該處在各區均駐有督導專員，相信當不致有任何弊端云。惟聞該處對各配售店出售配米後，巳撥出之部份將來均准予照舊價報銷，因此，目前若干米店聲稱之「配米售完」，顯係飾詞藏匿，觀望新價發表，以圖牟利無疑。同時兩日來市上謠傳配米新價卽將於日內調整，並謂將增加若干倍云云，致更增市民心理上之不安。根據大多數市民意見，渠等認爲負責調配民食當局，此次在配米尚未全部撥完，本月份配售工作未告結束之前，卽公佈配價隨時調整消息，殊爲失策，其結果將徒增無限紛擾。目前各米店所稱「配米售完」是否確係事實？各區督導員是否克盡監督之責？本月份配米是否可儘日內全部趕撥竣事？在新配價未公佈前之配售如何使其改善或復常？一般市民均盼當局澈查公佈，以釋羣疑。</p>
<p>配糧計算價格　中美研討方式</p>
<p>〔中央社訊〕都市配糧價格隨時調整之決定，顯已引起廣泛之注意，惟記者昨自多方面探悉，今後售價究將根據何種標準，予以調整，迄今尚未獲得一致之意見。有關各方於上月迭次商討後，曾擬規定以每月月終五天之市價平均數爲調整之基準，惟其後市價波動漸大，此法遂不足取。美經合分署美援運用委會，糧購會，市府，最近卽將開會研討，計算方式卽可商得最後決定。</p>

<h3 id="c128">加強心防　胡家鳳一席談 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南昌十日訊〕胡家鳳氏以江西文人身份出主贛政，是近數十年來江西政治，披上一件「文人主政」的新衣，一般關心江西政情的人們，對此新政，犒得怎樣，多予重視。記者居贛有年，深覺胡氏今日在江西是以書生本色—奉公守法，來替桑梓服務，他確是本着「實幹」的精神，對自己的老鄉幹了些工作。</p>
<p>記者昨訪謁贛主席胡家鳳氏暢談贛政時，兼論戡亂軍事與心防建設，胡氏深感今日和談的成就，須看國共雙方的誠意興遠見。</p>
<p>他說：「蔣總統元旦文告，昭示吾人，政府係以至誠，企求和平，充分表現有誠意，有遠見，而今日中國問題的解決，須中雙方互諒互讓，不能全憑一方之「單相思」而能求得眞正的和平」。</p>
<p>失敗主義　影響嚴重</p>
<p>胡氏於論及戡亂軍事問題時，以沉重的神態，表明渠對目前普遍深入於一些人民心坎的「失敗主義」與「兩可熊度」，他覺得今日對共產黨作戰，吾人的心防，已被突破，若不及時挽回，將陷入無法收拾的境地。此種現象，必然影嚮整個戡亂軍事的進展，甚至無法支持戡亂戰爭的持續。</p>
<p>渠對記者詳細分析「失敗主義」者的心理說：他們看到今日戡亂軍事的「吃敗仗」，以爲係前方軍隊作戰不力，或指揮不當，認爲大局演變到今天，已是無法挽回</p>
<p>兩可態度　毒素作用</p>
<p>「兩司態度」的人們，是有意無意，中了共產黨宣傳的毒紫，認爲國民黨主政，是爲老百姓工作，而共產黨來了，亦是一樣爲老百姓工作，甚至對貧窮的人們奢望更大，可以「翻身」，淸算的對象，是豪門，與老百姓無關。</p>
<p>現在，有許多人中了這樣的毒素而不覺，並且還道聽途說，以訛傳訛，不知不覺替共產黨做了宣傳員，共產黨份子，就是在這種毒素中更用欺騙詭計，故意渲染，將戰爭的罪惡，加在國民黨份上，使人民與政府脫節，深深的隔着一條鴻溝，這是一種最可怕的社會現象。</p>
<p>警惕奮鬥　糾正錯誤胡氏更强調：「我們要警惕過去的錯誤，加强心防建設，使每個中國老百姓，都能在戡建大蠢下，千萬人民一條心，認淸今日戡亂戰爭乃是反侵略，求自由。」　因爲共產黨在中國的倡亂，乃有其國際背景，有它的目標與主義，反之，我們現在要明暸，我們是爲了國家民族的生存，以至世界和平而應戰，所以我們今日的戡亂，乃爲反侵略戰，旣不是內戰，更不是爲保護特權階級而戰。</p>
<p>胡氏更深論共產黨統治下的人民，是無自由，無平等，他舉出蘇聯以及中國被共黨控制的地區的事實爲證，認爲共產黨是黨高於一切，一切屬於黨，祗要少數的共黨主持者認爲是利益，那末，老百姓是絕對無條件的遵守，所以共產黨主政，是集權的獨裁，沒有人民的自由。</p>
<p>爭示自由　達成平等</p>
<p>總理昭示吾人，中國的國民革命，是求中國的自由平等，所以我們爲了國家民族的生存要求自由，爲了自己的生存，亦要求自由，我們所企求的自由，是眞自由，而非假自由。</p>
<p>胡氏又談到共產黨的革命，是以暴力奪取政權，以「土革」，「翻身」，……來作號召，但是國民黨的革命，是以溫和的手段，達成革命的目的—民生主義。　所以國民黨是最適合中國國情的一個政黨，三民主義，更是以解決民生爲最後目的的革命主義</p>
<p>胡氏末謂：「喚醒『失敗主義」者與「兩可熊度」的人們，快速加强心防建設，完成戡建大業」。</p>

<p>〔本報福州十二日航訊〕沿海各省的省會中，以福州最爲落後，自京滬一帶開始疏散後，福州却被一般人目爲一塊安樂的土地，此間物價較低，交通尚稱便利，氣候亦較溫和，雖然是嚴冬的季節，只要是晴天，亦和暖如春。</p>
<p>自從疏散的人蜂湧來榕後，房荒更趨嚴重了，租房子非常困難，買房子也不容易，一幢木頭房子，討價要二十條金子。福州電力不足，沒有自來水，也談不上衛生設備，比較像樣一點的房子却少得可憐，但是互公小民等，只要在福州有親友的，多半都來了，要員如顧祝同·杭立武·范漢傑·林蔚等的眷屬均已抵榕，由京遷榕的機關有空軍第四供應分處及海軍一部份，人員器材均陸續專輪來榕。</p>
<p>疏散期中的福州機塲，頓顯熟鬧非常，十日僅專機卽達廿六架，十一日亦達十四架，惟福州機塲狹小，損壞程度已漸不堪使用，空軍總部決定擴修，將原有二二六畝面積擴充爲七九八畝，修築水泥跑道，停機棚，停機地，（Hardstanding）營舍等，但因徵用附近水田過多，鄉民大起恐慌，有鄉婦黄林氏者，因僅有數畝田地被征，厭世自縊。又衣黄依俤因此神經失常，終日至機塲叫罵，鄉民現正積極請求補助土地被征辦法，惟此刻尚無具體結果。</p>
<p>福州義亭機塲，近日過境飛機起落頻繁，惟塲地狹小，設備簡陋，跑道粗石散亂，對起飛降落均感不宜，當局有鑒及目前福州機塲之重要，已運送大枇水泥及工程人員，預計月內卽可開工，改修水泥跑道，並擬將跑道擴充爲一千八百公尺，將來巨型機均可起落無阻矣。</p>
<p>本地人素較保守，又因語言特殊，城市鄉村憑添許多異鄉來客，趣事横生，惟傷患官兵在榕人數亦多，遍佈市內鄉郊，引起本地人無限憂懼。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Mao Zedong Officially Issues Statement Proposing Eight Conditions for Peace Talks; Government Side Is Studying Them in Detail <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 14th (Broadcasting): The Chinese Communist Party Radio Station officially released today the "Statement on the Current Situation" signed by Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on January 12, proposing for the first time eight conditions for peace negotiations. The full text of this statement is more than 1,500 words long, and the eight conditions are: (1) Punish war criminals; (2) Abolish the existing constitution; (3) Abolish the existing legal system; (4) Reorganize all government troops based on democratic principles; (5) Confiscate bureaucratic capital; (6) Reform the land system; (7) Abolish "traitorous" treaties; (8) Convene a political consultative conference without the participation of "reactionaries" to establish a democratic coalition government to take over all powers of the Kuomintang government and local governments.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 14th (Broadcasting): According to a broadcast by the Chinese Communist Party Radio Station on the 14th, CCP leader Mao Zedong issued a statement on the current situation today in the name of Chairman of the Central Committee of the CCP, first attacking the government and the United States, saying that they should bear full responsibility for the civil war. The statement began by saying: "Since July 1946, the reactionary Kuomintang government in Nanjing, with the extravagant help of American imperialism, has violated the will of the people, torn up the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and launched a nationwide civil war, which has been going on for two and a half years. During these two and a half years of war, the Nanjing Kuomintang government, against the will of the people, convened a pseudo-National Assembly, promulgated a pseudo-constitution, elected a pseudo-president, and promulgated so-called decrees for the suppression of disturbances. It also sold out national interests to the United States, colluding with the US navy and air force to occupy China's territorial waters and airspace, and signed a large number of traitorous treaties. It also colluded with the US military advisory group to participate in the civil war, obtaining aircraft, cannons, rifles, shells, and all military supplies from the United States to slaughter and oppress the people. Based on a traitorous domestic and foreign policy, the Nanjing government commanded its millions of troops to launch a large-scale offensive against the People's Liberation Army. The people of Northeast, North, and Central China were all subjected to the ravages of the National Army. The people of Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, Changchun, Siping... and other places were all plundered and massacred by the National Army. They oppressed the broad masses of people from all walks of life in various places, demanding money and food to be used for the so-called suppression of disturbances. The Kuomintang government also constantly suppressed the just movements of various democratic parties and young students against the civil war and against hunger, and at the same time, it issued legal tender indiscriminately, leading the broad masses of the people to the brink of bankruptcy. All wealth was concentrated in the hands of bureaucratic capital, plunging the people into dire straits. The Kuomintang government cannot escape full responsibility for launching the civil war. On the contrary, since the Japanese surrender, the Chinese Communist Party has made every effort to avoid civil war. In October 1945, it conducted peace talks with the Kuomintang, and in January 1946, it signed a truce agreement. At the Political Consultative Conference, it signed a joint agreement with the Kuomintang. The CCP has also constantly worked for these agreements. Unfortunately, these agreements were all disregarded by the Kuomintang government, which launched a domestic war. Under such circumstances, the CCP had no choice but to rise up for the interests of the country and the interests of the people, and led the People's Liberation Army to resist the offensive of 4.3 million Kuomintang troops, turning itself from weak to strong, recovering all lost territories, and occupying major cities such as Zhengzhou and Xuzhou... The People's Liberation Army overcame unparalleled difficulties and strengthened itself. Now the People's Liberation Army is stronger than the reactionary Kuomintang army in terms of numbers, morale, and equipment. The People's Liberation Army has sufficient reason and full confidence that it can completely eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang in a short period of time. As long as the People's Liberation Army launches a few more major offensives, it can cause the remaining forces of the Kuomintang to collapse and be eliminated. Now the Kuomintang has reached the point where it cannot sustain itself, but in order to gain a respite so that it can regroup, President Chiang Kai-shek proposed on January 1 that he could conduct peace negotiations with the Communist Party. The CCP believes that this proposal is hypocritical because the proposal still insists on maintaining the pseudo-constitution, the pseudo-legal system, and protecting the reactionary army. The CCP believes that these are not conditions for peace talks, but conditions for continuing the war. For more than ten days, although the people have longed for peace, they do not approve of the hypocritical peace proposed by the Kuomintang. Under these circumstances, the Central Committee of the CCP issued a statement: Although the CCP can eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang in a short period of time, in order to quickly end the war and reduce the suffering of the people, the CCP is willing to conduct peace negotiations with the reactionary government in Nanjing and other local governments and military groups under eight major conditions (see separate item). The CCP believes that these conditions reflect the public opinion of the people of the whole country. If the people in the Nanjing government sincerely want peace and not a deception, and do not make hypocritical calls, they should abandon their hypocritical conditions and implement the eight conditions proposed by the CCP. It is hoped that the democratic parties of the whole country will rise up to strive for democratic peace. In addition, please all combatants of the People's Liberation Army pay attention: Before the conditions for democratic peace are realized by the Nanjing government, you must never slacken your combat efforts! Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the CCP, January 12, 1949."</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Nanjing, 14th: The CCP radio's broadcast of Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation has been transmitted to the capital. However, as of the night of the 14th, political figures had not yet been able to see the full text of the statement, so they did not make any positive comments. However, judging from the main points of the statement, since the Communist side said that it could still negotiate with the government side, it seems that the door to peace has not been closed. However, there is also another feeling, which is that regarding the first condition of the eight conditions proposed by the Communist side, which is to punish war criminals, and the eighth condition, which is to convene a political consultative conference and reject the so-called reactionary elements from participating, it is obviously doubtful whether it has the sincerity of peace talks. The government and all relevant parties are currently studying the content of the CCP broadcast in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Reception for All Circles in Wuhan; Bai Chongxi Briefly Describes the Current Situation; Encourages Military and Civilians in Central China to Prepare for War and Seek Peace <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 14th] Bai Chongxi, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in Central China, invited the heads of various agencies and groups in Wuhan, supervisory committee members residing in Hubei, and gentry to a tea party in the auditorium of the Political Committee on the 14th. More than 150 people attended. First, Bai made a brief report on the current situation, and then Kong Geng, Yu Zheng, Xu Kuizhi, Xia Guangyu, Ai Yuying, and others expressed their opinions. The meeting adjourned at around 5 o'clock. Bai's remarks at the tea party were as follows:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, leaders of the party, government, and military circles, in recent months, Chongxi has been suffering from bronchitis and has not fully recovered, so I have not been able to meet and talk with you. Recently, the current situation is brewing peace, and the issue that everyone is most concerned about is the current situation, especially during this major turning point in the overall situation, rumors are rife, causing widespread bewilderment and anxiety, which is enough to shake morale and will. Some people think that peace is about to be realized, and they can release their horses and let the cattle graze, being overly optimistic and showing slackness in their will. Conversely, some people are pessimistic and seem to be in dire straits, falling into despair. Both of these mentalities are not accurate. Therefore, I have specially invited you to this tea party today, taking this opportunity to make a brief report on the current situation.</p>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the Central Government has adhered to the goal of peaceful construction in order to realize democratic constitutionalism and build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, there was political consultation, and all parties and factions jointly formulated a program for peaceful construction, hoping to resolve the disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party through political means and jointly build a prosperous and happy Republic of China. Unexpectedly, mutual trust was not established, and the political consultation lasted for a year without any results. The government was forced to take military measures, which have been going on for three years, but national unity and peace have not yet been achieved, and the suffering of the people has been increasing. Recently, local public opinion organs, in order to seek national stability and construction, and for the military and civilians to recuperate, have spontaneously called for peace and advocated a ceasefire between the two sides, pending resolution by a peace conference. In his New Year's Day message, the President also proclaimed the advocacy of peace, preserving the nation's vitality and relieving the people's suffering. Now that the people long for peace, and the government is willing to realize peace, public opinion and the government, both at the top and at the bottom, have reached a consensus, and the door to peace has been reopened. Whether peace can be realized depends on the main key, which is that both sides respect public opinion and conduct open and honest consultations. However, the CCP has not yet officially and clearly expressed its position, and it is still launching fierce offensives against the National Army in Pingjin and Huaibei. Xiangfan in northern Hubei is now being attacked again. In such a situation, peace, which is hoped for by the people of the whole country, still relies on all parties to make the greatest efforts. We must recognize the seriousness of the current situation and deeply understand that peace cannot be achieved by chance. We should recognize that we can only have peace if we can fight, and we can only have peace if we are prepared to fight. We should prepare for war to seek peace, and not forget war while seeking peace. We should still stick to our posts, fulfill our duties, and be highly vigilant without any slackness. No matter how the current situation evolves, I hope that the military and civilians of Central China will be united in their hearts and work hard together to save us from the unprecedented crisis in the 5,000-year history and strive for the realization of true peace."</p>
<h3 id="e3">Zhang Qun Reports on His Trip to Hubei and Hunan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Nanjing, 14th: Kuomintang legislators and supervisors, as well as national representatives, held a current affairs symposium at the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 14th. Chairman Sun Ke attended, along with Yu Youren, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Ju Zheng, Wu Zhongxin, Zhang Lisheng, Hong Lanyou, and dozens of others. First, Zheng Yanfen, Secretary-General of the Central Standing Committee, reported, saying that there were many rumors from the outside world recently, especially misunderstandings about Hunan and Hubei. He specially invited Zhang Yuejun, who had just returned to Nanjing from Wuhan, to attend the meeting to report, so as to help everyone understand. Then, Zhang gave a detailed report on his trip to Hunan and Hubei. Zhang first read Bai Chongxi's telegrams to the President at the end of last year and the beginning of this month. According to the content of the two telegrams, each of which was several hundred words long, the first was to explain the current war situation, and the second was to ask the central government to make a clear decision on peace or war so that it could await orders and obey. There was no suggestion from Bai as rumored by the outside world. In his report, Zhang specially pointed out the inaccuracies in the Associated Press report, especially the so-called "ultimatum" was inappropriate. Zhang also reported that the opinion of Chairman Cheng Qian obtained during his trip to Hunan Province was: "The central government and local governments should have consistent opinions and unite sincerely." After Zhang finished his report, the attendees spoke separately, including Zhang Daofan, Duan Jianmin, and more than a dozen others. They had some inquiries, but there were no concrete opinions. Then, some people raised the importance of consistent unity, and after many people expressed their support, the meeting ended successfully. Shao Lizi also attended the meeting on the 14th, but did not express his opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Legislators and Supervisors Concerned About Peace Exchange Views at Separate Meetings in Nanjing <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Nanjing, 14th: Legislators in Nanjing held another discussion meeting at 3 p.m. on the 14th to exchange views on the peace issue. More than 100 legislators attended, and Zhang Jingyu was elected as the chairman. First, Huang Shaogu gave a comprehensive report on the reactions from all parties since the President's New Year's Day message and the development of the situation. Then, a wide-ranging discussion began, and the legislators spoke enthusiastically. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m. Although there were still no concrete resolutions on the 14th, it was very different from the previous discussion meeting, in that no one openly opposed peace anymore. Only some legislators explained that the President's New Year's Day message was to clarify public opinion's misunderstandings about peace and eliminate the atmosphere of defeatism, and did not mean abandoning the policy of suppressing the rebellion. Another group of legislators, a larger number, pointed out that the President's New Year's Day message clearly stated that if the CCP was sincere, the government was willing to negotiate peace with it. If it was said that it had no sincerity to negotiate peace before the CCP made a formal response, and then to make an ambiguous interpretation of the President's message, it would be tantamount to saying that the President also had no sincerity. Therefore, the government's peace policy was not in doubt. Moreover, in fact, peace was what the people of the whole country longed for and needed. The Legislative Yuan and the government were inseparable. Today, what should be done was to conform to the situation, represent the people, and assist the government in seeking the ultimate realization of peace. Some legislators also put forward concrete opinions on promoting peace talks. Some advocated that the government should issue a ceasefire order, some advocated that the government should send officials to the CCP area to negotiate peace, some advocated re-electing national representatives, amending the constitution, and implementing the constitution for the second time, and some advocated using international assistance to achieve fair peace. However, as it was a discussion meeting, all opinions were regarded as personal opinions and were not considered by the assembly to make a resolution.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Zhenjiang, 14th: Su Sheng's legislator Niu Jianchu, based on Article 69 of the Constitution, sent a letter to the Legislative Yuan requesting it to send a letter to solicit the consent of one-fourth of the legislators to convene a temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan in the near future to jointly discuss the major plan for peace.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Nanjing, 14th: In order to promote peace talks, the supervisors sent representatives to visit Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, and Shao Lizi on the 13th. They also invited Zhang, Shao, and the other three to lunch at the International Friendship Club at noon on the 14th, and asked the three to report on the peace issue and exchange views. The three all reported one after another. Then, Supervisors Tang Honglie, Sun Yulin, and others also spoke and exchanged many views. The meeting adjourned at around 3 p.m. It was heard that during the meeting on the 14th, the path to seek peace and the key to not achieving peace were discussed in detail, and there were many gains. After the three left the meeting, the supervisors decided to convene a temporary secret meeting on the morning of the 15th to further discuss the results of the meeting on the 14th in order to decide on concrete and feasible measures.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Peiping, 14th: When Fu Zuoyi hosted a banquet for academic celebrities such as He Siyuan, Zhu Guangqian, and Yang Zhensheng on the 13th, he expressed his attitude towards the current situation, saying: After the President's New Year's Day message was released, he hoped that peace could be realized as soon as possible. However, in North China, the troops under his command were being beaten, so he had to fight back in some places. At present, people in Peiping and Tianjin are calling for peace. As long as the other side does not fight, he will not fight hard, and he said that he neither seeks war nor submits. Although Peiping and Tianjin are besieged, he is fully responsible and can ensure that there is no worry. This was the first time that Chuan Shi had publicly clarified his attitude towards the current situation after the founding of Peiping.</p>

Lin Biao's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 12th Columns, as well as the Artillery Column, are besieging Tianjin. Although they have suffered repeated disastrous defeats, they do not seem to have given up their attempt to besiege the city. Our army's morale is high, the defenses are strong, and communication is swift. Each time the bandits launch a fierce attack, they only suffer heavy casualties and reap the consequences of their own evil deeds. At 3:00 PM yesterday, the sound of artillery fire resumed, breaking the momentary silence. Lin Biao's 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Columns again employed wave tactics, releasing smoke screens and attacking fiercely towards Daxiyingmen, Xiaoxiyingmen, and Beixinzhuang. Our defending troops under Lin Wei fiercely counterattacked, and our iron birds also flew in to assist. The land, air, infantry, and artillery closely coordinated. The artillery fiercely attacked their rear waves, and the infantry brought their machine gun firepower into full play, severely striking their front waves. Added to the immense threat from our air force, the bandits were unable to succeed despite five fierce assaults, and by 8:30 PM, they abandoned thousands of corpses and retreated in disarray.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced: Nie Rongzhen's bandits on the outskirts of Beiping, in order to coordinate with Lin Biao's bandits, launched the first phase of their offensive, continuously harassing the areas outside Guang'anmen, Deshengmen, Andingmen, and Dongzhimen with small groups.

<h3 id="e19">Starting with the Holy Land Problem <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The most intractable problem after the war, the Palestine problem, has been handled by the United Nations for almost two full years. This problem is like a tangled mess; the more you try to unravel it, the more tangled it becomes. Not only has no "dead knot" been untied, but the "dead knots" have become tighter and tighter. No wonder the great scientist Einstein would blame the United Nations for its incompetence. At the end of November last year, there was a strong hope for a truce between the Jews and Arabs, and the restoration of peace in the Holy Land. But in the blink of an eye, an unexpected twist occurred. Differences of opinion arose within the Arab League. Jordan demanded the annexation of the eastern part of the Holy Land, while Egypt, Syria, and other countries jointly opposed it. As a result, the flames of war in the Negev rekindled. The British Cabinet then decided to prepare for military action. Two thousand British troops landed in Aqaba in case of emergency, and there were also rumors that the Mediterranean fleet would be dispatched to blockade the Israeli coast. As a result, the situation in the Middle East became tense again!</p>
<p>The resurgence of the Holy Land problem not only caused a great uproar in the British Cabinet, with Foreign Secretary Bevin being criticized and threatening to resign several times, but also almost caused friction between Britain and the United States internationally. According to analysts from the United Nations at Lake Success, it is believed that the divergence of opinion between Britain and the United States on the Holy Land problem may develop into a competition between the two countries for political position in the Middle East. Britain hopes that Jordan can obtain greater benefits, so it strives to find a peaceful solution to the Holy Land problem that is favorable to Jordan, while the United States supports an immediate truce, which would allow Egypt to gain more. Therefore, under this international backdrop, the Holy Land problem has become even more complex, and the situation in the Middle East has become even more serious.</p>
<p>Palestine was transferred by the old League of Nations to British trusteeship after the First World War, but the problem itself was never resolved. After the Second World War, Britain submitted it to the United Nations General Assembly in April 1947 and requested the next General Assembly to make recommendations on the future government of Palestine. The first General Assembly established a Special Committee on Palestine, composed of representatives from eleven countries, to conduct preliminary research on the Holy Land problem and submit reports to the regular session at any time. In November of the same year, the Second General Assembly of the United Nations passed the recommendation of the Special Committee on Palestine by a two-thirds majority, advocating the division of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, economically interconnected, and internationalizing the Holy City of Jerusalem, under the direct jurisdiction of the United Nations.</p>
<p>This plan to implement partition in the Holy Land is theoretically unobjectionable, but it is problematic in practice. The Arab countries were the first to reject this recommendation, and Britain was unwilling to assume responsibility for implementing a plan that had not been agreed upon by both sides. So the problem remained unresolved. The Special Committee on Palestine reported to the Security Council in February 1948, requesting the United Nations to take swift action to assist in the implementation of this proposal in order to prevent bloodshed in the Holy Land. The Security Council then requested the General Assembly to hold a special session to discuss the situation in the Holy Land, resulting in the appointment of a mediator, Count Bernadotte of Sweden, to personally mediate the dispute between the Jews and Arabs in the Holy Land. However, the British Mandate over Palestine ended on May 15, and the Jews opportunistically declared the establishment of the State of Israel, and the Arab Allied Forces then rushed into the Holy Land, thus the flames of war in the Holy Land broke out. Since then, although the Security Council has repeatedly called for a truce, and the mediator has run around and appealed, even sacrificing his life, the situation has been one of talking and fighting, and fighting and talking. It was not until the end of November last year that a ray of hope for peace was revealed, but unfortunately, it was ruined by an unexpected twist. This is really unfortunate for the Holy Land, and it is also unfortunate for the whole world!</p>
<p>The protracted nature of the Palestine problem is due to the inherent incompatibility between Jews and Arabs, but looking at the course of its development, it is not difficult to see that Britain and the United States cannot shirk their responsibility for the Holy Land problem being trapped in a stalemate. Although Britain has announced that the mandate over the Holy Land has ended, it still cannot forget the Middle East and is reluctant to give up its vested political position in the Middle East. The United States has also never had a "firm and unwavering" stance on the Holy Land problem. One moment it sympathizes with the Jewish "restoration movement," and the next moment it is afraid of offending the Arab countries and losing their goodwill. Therefore, it goes back and forth, wandering on a fork in the road. Under the contradiction of these two forces, the Holy Land problem can only be trapped in a stalemate and cannot be opened.</p>
<p>This problem seems to have taken a turn for the better in recent days. We hope that British and American diplomats can broaden their vision and should focus on peace in the Middle East, quickly abandon the self-serving power politics, and immediately take diplomatic action to jointly seek a century-long plan for peace in the Middle East.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The case of literary writer Luo Binji betraying the country has been concluded by the Special Criminal Court of the Capital, and the sentence was pronounced yesterday, sentencing him to two years and six months of imprisonment. Luo has been detained in Changchun since his arrest on March 11, 1943, for a total of one year and ten months and three days. After the verdict, he will be able to be released after serving another eight months of imprisonment. Luo is currently detained in the Tiger Bridge Prison in this city. Another accomplice, Meng Shirong, was sentenced to one year and ten months of imprisonment, which has already been served and he has been released. The facts are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Luo Binji, also known as Zhang Junpu, was friendly with Zhou Jingwen. Because the standing committee members of the Democratic League were persuaded by Zhou during the political consultations, Luo had agreed to be nominated as a National Representative by the Democratic League. After the victory, he was introduced to Chen Jianzhong by Zhou, and they agreed to go from Shanghai to Tianjin, then to Changchun. He carried a draft of Zhou Jingwen's "Letter to Armed Comrades in the Northeast and Letter to Compatriots in the Northeast" and agreed to represent the so-called Preparatory Committee of the Northeast People's Autonomous Committee. On March 8, 1947, he signed an agreement with Chen Cang (Chen Jianzhong), representative of the so-called Northeast Youth Association, and Li Kaizhou (Kong Zhiming), representative of the Northeast People's Patriotic Aid Association, advocating the establishment of a local joint government for the autonomous region of the Northeast, planning to seize territory and organize local political power in areas of the Northeast not yet recovered by the National Army, naming it the "Temporary Northeast People's Autonomous Committee," with the Central Executive Committee as the highest authority, and establishing the Northeast People's Self-Defense Army Headquarters. Meng Shirong served as a shock team member in the Northeast in 1942, was injured and unemployed, and met Chen Jianzhong several times. He mistakenly recognized him as a member of the Ministry of National Defense and, understanding his conspiracy plan, also did not withdraw, but followed along and echoed. On March 11, 1947, he set off from Changchun by car, first to Nongan, then to Harbin, when he was discovered by the Northeast Security Command and captured en route. The prosecutor investigated and prosecuted him. The presiding judge believed that the defendants illegally called for local autonomy, violating the National Constitution, and committing the crime of internal rebellion. Therefore, he ruled in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Washington, 14th Broadcast: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved Acheson's nomination as Secretary of State.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th Dispatch] Acheson, who has been nominated as the US Secretary of State, stated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that his foreign policy would not deviate significantly from President Truman's policies, and that he is not an appeaser of the Soviet Union. Acheson's appointment as Secretary of State requires approval from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Foreign Relations Committee did not publicly question his foreign policy stance today, partly because it is related to US interests and security, and also because the US foreign policy will be determined by the President himself. The Foreign Relations Committee today asked Acheson, based on his past experience, to conduct a comprehensive review of US policy towards the Soviet Union. Acheson clearly stated that US foreign policy should be decided by the President, and the President has made it clear that he has no intention of changing foreign policy. Regarding his experience in the State Department, Acheson said, "From my past experience, I have learned that US foreign policy needs to be stable and consistent." He said that some people believe he favors the Soviet Union, but this is contrary to the principles he has adhered to throughout his political life. He is determined to do everything possible to prevent those who seek to subvert the government from infiltrating the State Department. Former Secretary of State Stettinius strongly advocated that the Senate should approve Acheson's nomination, and praised Acheson as an intelligent and wise man who will surely make the honor and security of the nation the goal of his work. Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expects that the Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate will approve Acheson's nomination.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th Dispatch] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee questioned Acheson today about his views after taking office as Secretary of State. Acheson assured that he would continue to implement the "non-appeasement" policy towards the Soviet Union after taking office as Secretary of State, and said that he would see to the purging of pro-communist elements within the State Department. Senator Vandenberg asked Acheson to clearly state his "basic attitude" towards the Soviet Union. Acheson replied, "The decision on foreign policy rests with the President. The President has declared in the clearest terms that he does not intend to make any changes." Acheson's remarks reinforce the general impression that Truman himself will be the primary figure in the future decisions of US foreign policy, and that Acheson, as Secretary of State, will serve as an advisor and executor, not a policy planner.</p>

The company is using its safety stock of coal to make up for the shortage. If this continues, the company's coal reserves will be exhausted in two months, and power generation will be reduced again.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Additional Balancing Fee for Deposits and Exchanges - Minister of Finance Explains to Assembly - Aims to Avoid Profiteering from Arbitrage - Genuine Compelling Reasons <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Assembly previously resolved at its eighth meeting of the first session to suggest that the Ministry of Finance improve the method of depositing and exchanging gold and silver and stabilize prices. Yesterday, a reply telegram was received from Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance, explaining the gold and silver deposit and exchange policy in detail. The original telegram stated: "To Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Deputy Speaker Xu Jijing of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly, greetings. I have received and noted your telegram. I am grateful for your Assembly's concern about the deposit and exchange of gold and silver and the stabilization of prices. As for your instructions to the Central Bank to sell a large amount of materials to suppress prices, we have already complied. As for the gold deposit and exchange method, it is intended to consolidate the currency and contract the currency in circulation. At the beginning of the program, there was no limit to the amount of deposit and exchange. Later, due to large-scale arbitrage and manipulation by major players, the gold that was exchanged fell into the hands of a few, and ordinary people lost the opportunity for equal savings. The government accepted the suggestion and set a limit of one tael per person for deposit and exchange. Not long after the implementation, because the deposit and exchange price and the market price were vastly different, depositors could obtain huge profits in a single transaction and rushed to purchase, making it impossible to maintain order. In order to reduce deposit and exchange congestion, implement the original purpose of contracting the currency in circulation, and prevent depositors from obtaining excessive profits, a decision was made to add a balancing fee. The internal value of the Gold Yuan is dependent on the deposit and exchange of the Gold Yuan, while the external value is dependent on the price of foreign exchange trading. In order to encourage exports and attract overseas remittances, the government has adopted a linked system for import and export trade, using foreign exchange transfer certificates to make foreign exchange prices suitable for natural levels. At the same time, in order to absorb overseas remittances, the price of overseas remittances should not be too low. Therefore, a huge difference arose between the foreign exchange price and the amount of Gold Yuan paid for the deposit and exchange of gold and silver, causing the internal and external values of the Gold Yuan to lose their equilibrium. Therefore, we had to adjust it. All these measures are in fact a need to weigh the pros and cons and adapt to the facts, and there are compelling reasons. Your Assembly represents public opinion, and you lead public discourse. I hope you will explain it well so that everyone can understand and empathize. I am very grateful. Xu Kan."</p>

The soldiers of the search company of the army suddenly had a dispute with the special service company soldiers stationed at the station by the Garrison Command. The soldiers returned to the team and gathered dozens of soldiers, carrying grenades to the dormitory of the special service company soldiers to seek revenge. One of them pulled the trigger of the grenade and intended to throw it at the entrance of the first- and second-class ticket offices. At that time, Beizhan was the time when various trains were concentrated for departure, and there were thousands of passengers lining up to wait for tickets in the hall. Just as the soldier was about to throw the grenade, his major officer rushed to the scene after hearing the news and bravely stepped forward to snatch the grenade. The grenade was already smoking and about to explode. At this critical moment, the major gently placed the grenade in a place with fewer passengers. There was a loud explosion, and several workers and passengers fled in panic, causing great chaos. After the incident, Chief Huang of the Unified Inspection Office immediately reported by telegram to Director He Longqing of the Inspection Office, who personally went to the station to suppress the situation.

<p>[Our Newspaper] The original regulations for the population-rationed rice for January in this city stipulated that each certificate would be allocated 15 市斤 catties at a price of 63 yuan, and the priority-rationed price was 42 yuan. However, on the 12th, the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration 美經合分署美援運用會 announced that the price of population-rationed grain would be adjusted every two weeks or ten days according to a new method, and Mayor Wu explained on the 13th that it might be implemented at any time starting this month. After hearing the news, citizens in various districts rushed to the rice shops to buy rice, but were rejected by most rice shops on the grounds that "rationed rice is sold out." This reporter visited various districts in the afternoon yesterday and found that there were at least twenty or thirty people lining up in front of each rationed rice shop, but about seven out of ten had already hung out "sold out" signs, and the crowd was still waiting. According to the Civil Food Allocation Office, more than three-fifths of the rationed rice for each rationed rice shop in this city for January has been allocated, and all of the rice that should have been rationed last year has also been allocated. Currently, 25,000 to 30,000 piculs continue to be allocated every day. With 2,000 rationed rice shops in this city, each shop should be able to supply at least 10 piculs of rationed rice per day. In theory, the shops should not be sold out so quickly, and the office has supervisory commissioners stationed in each district, so it is believed that there should not be any malfeasance. However, it is heard that the office will allow each rationed shop to report the portion of the rationed rice that has been allocated at the old price in the future. Therefore, the current claim of "rationed rice sold out" by some rice shops is obviously a disguise to hide the rice and wait for the announcement of the new price in order to seek profits. At the same time, rumors have been circulating in the market for the past two days that the new price of rationed rice will be adjusted within days, and it is said that it will increase several times, which has further increased the psychological anxiety of citizens. According to the opinions of the majority of citizens, they believe that the authorities responsible for allocating civil food were ill-advised to announce the news that the price would be adjusted at any time before all the rationed rice was allocated and before the rationing work for this month was completed. The result will only add to the endless turmoil. Is it true that the "rationed rice is sold out" claimed by the rice shops is true? Are the supervisory commissioners in each district fulfilling their supervisory responsibilities? Can the allocation of rationed rice for this month be completed as soon as possible? How can the rationing be improved or restored before the new price is announced? The general public hopes that the authorities will thoroughly investigate and announce the results to dispel public doubts.</p>
<p>Pricing Calculation for Rationed Grain - Sino-American Discussion of Methods</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] The decision to adjust the price of urban rationed grain at any time has obviously attracted widespread attention, but reporters have learned from various sources that the exact standards to which the sales price will be adjusted has yet to be agreed upon. After repeated discussions by relevant parties last month, it was proposed to stipulate that the average market price for the last five days of each month would be the basis for adjustment, but since then, market price fluctuations have increased, and this method is no longer feasible. The U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration 美經合分署美援運用委會, the Grain Purchase Association, and the Municipal Government will hold a meeting soon to discuss and reach a final decision on the calculation method.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Stock Exchange has been temporarily closed since the currency reform last autumn, and it has not been restored for several months. The brokers' association of the exchange has sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting permission to resume business immediately. Yesterday, they also sent representatives to submit a petition to the city council. They also suggested that at this time when the city urgently needs funds for local defense, after the stock exchange market is restored, a special defense donation could be levied on securities transfers, in order to fulfill the purpose of taking money from the people and using it for the local area. After the city council sent staff to meet with the representatives, they agreed to forward the petition to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and the municipal government for processing and response.</p>

<p>According to the person in charge of the Gold Shops Association, the issue of the industry's resumption of business has already been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for instructions by the Gold Control Bureau, and they are currently waiting for the Ministry of Finance's approval.

However, a small number of gold shops have resumed the sale of savings gold in order to maintain their livelihoods, and the Gold Shops Association finds it difficult to restrict them. As for various rumors, such as gold shops listing prices for ornaments, they are all false rumors, because the price of gold ornaments can only be calculated and listed after the official resumption of business.</p>

<p>The rice market turned weak yesterday, and transactions became quiet. Although the arrival of goods was small yesterday, the sales were even slower, because the underground interest rates were still high, and the rice shops had limited appetite and did not accept much. The prices in the Southern Market were similar to the previous day when it opened in the morning, but the Central Market gradually showed weakness.

<p>Wheat Flour: Initially fell and then rose, resulting in a slight increase compared to the previous day. The opening trend was very weak because the underground interest rates were still high, and the owners were very willing to sell. The old trucks opened below 500 yuan, at 495 yuan.

<p>[Our Newspaper] According to tea industry insiders, the varieties of red and green tea are rare due to both production and inventory shortages. High-quality teas are even harder to find, so although there is a supply currently, the body is not as exquisite as in the past. However, tea households also regard them as treasures and are reluctant to part with them, so the trend is unmatched. Prices have not shown significant progress due to the disparity in the quality of the goods compared to the past, but they are apparently flat but covertly firm, and the bottom is quite solid. Transactions are still narrow as buyers hesitate.</p>

<p>The sugar market was inactive yesterday, and the trend was weak. Most commodities fell more than rose, and people's confidence could not be boosted, so prices turned down in the afternoon.

The demand for head money has also been more relaxed, while the source of supply has improved. Market dismantling interest rates vary depending on the needs, with the highest still reaching 70 yuan for daily dismantling, but generally 60 yuan, and as low as 50 yuan for supply. Cash funds are still very tight, and premiums are still high.</p>
<p>The money market showed slight easing near noon, and the supply of orders was also strong, but market dismantling rates still held steady. Financial experts agree that this is a hidden danger for the future of commodity prices.</p>

After the National Bank came out to maintain it, it stabilized slightly, selling at 181 yuan, resulting in a drop of 16 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>

Heavenly Bridge No. 120 opened in the morning at 80,000 yuan. The trend in the middle was stable, and the asking price rose and fell slightly. The afternoon closed at 82,000 yuan, still flat with the previous day.</p>
<p>Due to the low market conditions for foreign exchange certificates, foreign companies were unwilling to absorb the export of raw silk, and the asking price was stagnant. Transactions were quite slow. Superior grade single lot spot goods were still called for 90,000 yuan in the morning. After calling, the buying appetite declined, and the market situation was bleak. People were unable to boost their spirits, and the market closed at 87,000 yuan, falling slightly by 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The silk market fluctuated yesterday, and the trend was tortuous. Prices fluctuated high and low. The goals of buyers and sellers were different, and selling and buying were still strong.

<p>The yarn market continued to be weak yesterday, because most items outside the circle tended to decline, and the lunar New Year was approaching, and the buying appetite of customers seemed to be thin. Moreover, the underground interest rates in the market were high, and the multi-party was forced to come out due to the pressure of high interest rates, so the momentum to rise was weakened. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 78,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan, and the noon closing price fell back to 77,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan lower than before. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell by 3,000 yuan, and 32-count Blue Phoenix also fell slightly by 3,000 yuan.

One-day interest rate arbitrage was 2,500 yuan. 20-count Double Horse rose slightly by 500 yuan, and Jin Cheng and other majorities stayed at the original prices. The 16-count presented a situation where honor and disgrace were mutually visible. All 10-count tended to move downstream.</p>

<p>The cotton cloth market trend was still high when it first opened, but the money market on the market was still tight, and there were few buyers, so the market was unable to rise. The result was finally smaller than before. The extraburial asking price for the leading fine cloth remained around 2,000 yuan. Loose-packed trumpet boy fine cloth was made at 1,750 yuan, and the original packing stepped down from 1,850 yuan to a result of 1,825 yuan.

<h3 id="e126">Shen Bao Sponsors the Second (Summer of 1948) Free Tuberculosis Prevention X-Ray Examination <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>In June and July of last year (1948), this newspaper jointly organized the second free tuberculosis prevention X-ray examination with the city's Lung Disease Center Clinic and 15 hospitals, including Guangci, Sino-American, Gongji, Municipal Second, Third, Fourth, Zhongshan, Hongren, Renji, Pingmin, Nanyang, Sino-Western, Chinese, and Hongqiao. A total of 2,139 readers applied for the examination before and after. Afterwards, the Lung Disease Center Clinic was entrusted with statistical work. After the experts of the clinic carefully studied, the following results were obtained:</p>
<p>(1) Among the 2,139 people who were examined, a total of 1,783 people (more than 83%) were completely healthy, 356 people (less than 17%) had tuberculosis, and 60 people had other conditions.</p>
<p>(2) According to the gender distribution, 313 men had lung disease, and 1,598 men did not have lung disease; 43 women had lung disease, and 185 women did not have lung disease.</p>
<p>(3) According to the occupation distribution, businessmen had the most cases of lung disease, followed by students, and farmers had the fewest cases.</p>
<p>(4) According to the age distribution, the 15-25 age group had the most patients, followed by the 25-30 age group, and the over 55 age group had the fewest patients.</p>
<p>Looking at the above figures, we can learn that men have more cases of lung disease than women, businessmen and students have more cases than farmers, and young people have more cases than old people.</p>
<p>At the same time, because only more than 1,000 people participated in the examination, accounting for one in 250 of the city's population, and because the occupations, ages, and genders of the examinees were mixed, the results obtained could not be accurate, but they are sufficient for medical reference.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Strengthening Mental Defenses: A Discussion with Hu Jiafeng <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanchang, 10th] Hu Jiafeng's governance of Jiangxi as a Jiangxi intellectual is a new cloak of "intellectual governance" on Jiangxi politics in recent decades. People who generally care about Jiangxi's political situation pay more attention to how this new policy will turn out. This reporter has been in Jiangxi for many years and deeply feels that Mr. Hu is serving his hometown with a scholar's character - public service and law-abiding. He is indeed working for his fellow villagers in the spirit of "doing practical work."</p>
<p>When this reporter interviewed Jiangxi Chairman Hu Jiafeng yesterday to talk about Jiangxi politics, he also discussed the suppression of the rebellion and the construction of mental defenses. Mr. Hu deeply felt that the success of today's peace talks depends on the sincerity and vision of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>He said: "President Chiang's New Year's Day message shows us that the government is seeking peace with the utmost sincerity, fully demonstrating its sincerity and vision. The solution to China's problems today requires mutual understanding and concession between the two sides. True peace cannot be achieved solely by one side's 'unrequited love'."</p>
<p>Defeatism Has a Serious Impact</p>
<p>When discussing the issue of suppressing the rebellion, Mr. Hu solemnly stated that he was concerned about the "defeatism" and "ambiguous attitude" that are currently widespread and deeply rooted in the hearts of some people. He felt that in today's war against the Communist Party, our mental defenses have been broken through, and if we do not recover in time, we will fall into an unmanageable situation. This phenomenon will inevitably affect the progress of the entire suppression of the rebellion, and may even be unable to support the continuation of the war to suppress the rebellion.</p>
<p>He gave a detailed analysis of the psychology of "defeatists" to this reporter, saying: They saw the "defeats" of today's suppression of the rebellion, and thought that it was due to the poor fighting of the front-line troops, or improper command. They believed that the overall situation had evolved to today and could not be reversed.</p>
<p>Ambiguous Attitude Is Poisonous</p>
<p>People with an "ambiguous attitude" are intentionally or unintentionally poisoned by Communist propaganda, believing that the Kuomintang's governance is for the benefit of the people, and that the Communist Party will also work for the benefit of the people when it comes, and even have greater expectations for the poor, who can "turn over" and the targets of the liquidation are the wealthy, which has nothing to do with the people.</p>
<p>Now, many people are unaware of being poisoned by such toxins, and they also spread rumors and pass them on, unknowingly acting as propagandists for the Communist Party. Communist Party members use deception and tricks in this kind of toxin to deliberately render the sins of war on the Kuomintang, disconnecting the people from the government, and creating a deep gap, which is the most terrible social phenomenon.</p>
<p>Be Vigilant and Strive to Correct Mistakes</p>
<p>Mr. Hu emphasized: "We must be vigilant about the mistakes of the past, strengthen the construction of mental defenses, so that every Chinese people can be united in the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, and recognize that today's war to suppress the rebellion is against aggression and for freedom." Because the Communist Party's rebellion in China has its international background, its goals, and its doctrines. On the other hand, we must now understand that we are fighting for the survival of the nation and the country, and even for world peace. Therefore, our suppression of the rebellion today is a war against aggression. It is neither a civil war nor a war to protect the privileged class.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu further discussed that the people under the rule of the Communist Party have no freedom and no equality. He cited the facts in the Soviet Union and the areas in China controlled by the Communist Party as evidence, believing that the Communist Party is higher than everything, and everything belongs to the Party. As long as the minority of Communist Party leaders think it is in their interest, then the people must unconditionally obey. Therefore, the Communist Party's governance is a centralized dictatorship, with no freedom for the people.</p>
<p>Strive for Freedom and Achieve Equality</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen showed us that the Chinese national revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China. Therefore, we demand freedom for the survival of the nation and the country, and we also demand freedom for our own survival. The freedom we seek is true freedom, not false freedom.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu also talked about the Communist Party's revolution is to seize power by violence, and to use "land reform," "turning over," etc. as slogans, but the Kuomintang's revolution is to achieve the goal of the revolution - people's livelihood - by peaceful means. Therefore, the Kuomintang is the most suitable political party for China's national conditions, and the Three People's Principles are a revolutionary doctrine that aims to solve people's livelihood as its ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu concluded: "Wake up the 'defeatists' and those with an 'ambiguous attitude,' quickly strengthen the construction of mental defenses, and complete the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the country."</p>

<h3 id="e131">The Pulsation of Rong City <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zheng Shizhu for this Newspaper</p>
<p>[Airmail Dispatch from Fuzhou, This Newspaper, 12th] Among the provincial capitals of the coastal provinces, Fuzhou is the most backward. Since the evacuation began from the Beijing and Shanghai area, Fuzhou has been regarded by the general public as a land of ease and comfort. Prices here are lower, transportation is still relatively convenient, and the climate is also relatively mild. Although it is the season of severe winter, as long as it is a sunny day, it is as warm as spring.</p>
<p>Since the evacuees flocked to Rong, the housing shortage has become even more severe. Renting a house is very difficult, and buying a house is not easy either. A wooden house is priced at twenty taels of gold. Fuzhou has insufficient electricity, no running water, and no sanitary facilities to speak of. The relatively decent houses are pitifully few, but most of the petty officials and common people, as long as they have relatives and friends in Fuzhou, have come here. Important figures such as the families of Gu Zhutong, Hang Liwu, Fan Hanjie, and Lin Wei have all arrived in Rong. The agencies relocated from Beijing to Rong include the Air Force Fourth Supply Sub-Bureau and a portion of the Navy. Personnel and equipment are continuously arriving in Rong via special ships.</p>
<p>The Fuzhou Airport during the evacuation period has suddenly become extremely busy. On the 10th alone, 26 special planes arrived, and on the 11th, 14 planes arrived. However, the Fuzhou Airport is small, and the extent of damage has gradually become unusable. The Air Force Headquarters has decided to expand it, expanding the original 226 mu of area to 798 mu, building cement runways, hangars, hardstanding, barracks, etc. However, due to the excessive requisition of nearby paddy fields, villagers are greatly alarmed. A village woman named Huang Lin committed suicide out of despair because only a few mu of her farmland were requisitioned. Also, Yi Huang, because of this, became mentally disturbed, and cursed at the airport all day long. The villagers are now actively requesting subsidies for the requisitioned land, but there are no concrete results at this moment.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Yiting Airport has seen frequent takeoffs and landings of planes passing through in recent days. However, the airfield is small, the facilities are rudimentary, and the runway is scattered with rough stones, which is unsuitable for both takeoff and landing. The authorities, recognizing the current importance of Fuzhou Airport, have transported a large batch of cement and construction personnel, and it is expected that construction will begin within the month to rebuild the cement runway, and it is planned to expand the runway to 1,800 meters, so that giant aircraft can take off and land without hindrance in the future.</p>
<p>The locals are inherently more conservative, and because of the unique language, the city and countryside are adding many out-of-town visitors, resulting in many amusing incidents. However, there are also many wounded and sick soldiers in Rong, scattered throughout the city and countryside, causing the locals to be infinitely worried and fearful.</p>
