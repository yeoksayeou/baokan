<h3>和談成敗一髮千鈞　南京空氣緊張沉重　政府密切研討中共要求</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中共電台北平十七日消息：今日為和平談判的第十七天，四月一日至十二日，中共代表團與南京代表團，經過頻繁的接觸和交換意見，擬訂了國內和平協定草案。十三日雙方代表團在故宮舉行正式會議，中共代表團說明了中共的立塲和協定草案的理由，南京代表團對協定草案表示了自己的立塲和意見。十五日雙方舉行第二次正式會議，中共代表團將協定最後修正案交付南京代表團，協定全文為八條廿四款，不但採納了南京代表團方面的意見，各民主黨派的領袖人物亦從旁積極提供了意見。中共代表團於十五日的雙方會議上宣佈，談判以四月二十日為限期，南京代表團是否願意於協定上簽字，須於四月二十日以前表示態度，四月二十日為簽字日期。十六日上午十一時，南京代表團派遣黃紹竑代表及屈武顧問飛南京，向南京政府請示，現正等候南京的答覆。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕中共所提政治上成立聯合機構及軍事上立卽渡江之兩項要求，頃經證實，係中共所提八條廿四款中最重要部份。在談全部條款提出研討時，若干問題均可商酌，互有讓步，惟以上兩點成為困難之焦點，尤以限期短促，更增困難。其所指聊合機構，聞係定名為管制委員會，由雙方推派代表組成，全權替代現政府。至渡江之要求，則希望及早實現，以實行改編軍隊，「保障和談」。八項條件之第一條，原為懲辦戰犯，經會商後，業已放棄原議，不再堅持，但說明戰犯責任誰屬，蔣總統必須出國，以及原列戰犯之某某等人士，均不得參加未來之聯合政府。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕李代總統將不致接受中共所提八條廿四款中之組織聯合機構，及共軍渡江之兩項要求。記者於十七日訪問接近李代總統之某人士時，已獲得此項暗示。該人士承認目前最大困難，厥為上述兩點，渠於强調「政府絕不投降」後宣稱：「共軍絕不能渡江，如共軍渡江，一切均不能談了。」</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕據悉黃紹竑由平携回之和平協定草案八條廿四款，現正由政府比密研究中。李代總統·何院長·張羣。白崇禧·閻錫山·吳忠信·徐永昌等，十六十七兩日，密切接觸，商討對案。聞在滬之吳鐵城，已應李代總統之請，携和平協定草案赴溪口，向蔣總統請示，以便作最後決定。中共要求於四月廿日簽字，政府方面之對案，將儘可能於廿日前決定後，仍交黃紹竑携往北平，由政府代表團繼續與中共折衝。</p>
<h3>政府對策决定後　黃紹竑即携返平　第三方面人士赴平交通無問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕黃紹竑返平期，將有延遲。渠將在京等待政府對於中共所提和平協定草案之決定。黃氏在平期間，以每日集會，或與各方人士接觸，均至午夜後二時或四時始畢，辛勞過度，血壓陡高，十六日返京後，因各項報吿均係書面文件，黃僅略事說明，卽由李代總統及何院長等會同研究。黃紹竑則擬於日內充份休息，十七日上午除往賀于右任壽辰外，僅至何應欽官邸晤談後，卽返傅厚崗休息。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕中共邀約第三方面人士張瀾等赴平事，政府方面已允予交通上之便利，凡接受中共之邀請，而欲前往者，政府卽為供給飛機前往。頃悉中共邀請之意見，係由政府代表團轉來，業經政府轉吿張等，中共除去指定邀約之人負，並表示如赴平便機座次有餘額，凡願去者，均可前往。此次邀請之人士，除張瀾，羅隆基，葉篤義，史良，楊衛玉，冷　等外，尙有郭則沈，羅涵先，王艮仲等。</p>
<h3>北平舞塲茶　每杯人民劵百元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃晤及前日自平返滬之中央航空公司五一五號機上人員，承談北平近况，茲略誌於后：</p>
<p>渠等抵平後，住於六國飯店，費用由中共代付，飲食甚佳，中餐西餐任擇，鷄鴨魚肉不缺，行動亦甚自由。</p>
<p>中共高級首長所穿服裝極為平常，甚且近乎襤褸。渠等所見如葉劍英，自外表視之，絕對不會想到他是一位將軍。</p>
<p>北平至濟南與鄭州，現已有空中交通，平濟間有C46型機飛行，平鄭間有C47型機飛行。</p>
<p>北平市面安定而蕭條，一般商店均生意淸淡，街頭行人大都衣衫樸實，女子多着布衣，雖然如此，高貴奢侈之物品，祗要有錢還是可以買到。</p>
<p>舞塲照常營業，茶錢每杯人民券一百元，某君在內消磨三小時，給舞女人民票三百元。</p>
<p>金圓券與人民券之比率，最近為一百二十對一，袁大頭每元合人民券二百三十元。</p>
<h3>白崇禧之外甥　隨黃紹竑來京</h3>
<p>海競强被俘釋出送歸</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕隨同黃紹竑十六日專機來京者，尙有白祟禧之外甥海競强，海為某師師長，前與共軍作戰時被俘，頃經釋出送返。海氏在機塲時因堅不吐露姓名，曾被目為神秘客。</p>

<h3>港黃金走私入穗</h3>
<p>粵漢車上緝獲千兩</p>
<p>〔中央社香港十七日電〕工商晚報今載稱：據海關方面消息，黃金由香港走私入穗，極形猖獗，十六日一日間，粵海關在粵漢車上緝獲一千兩私金，破空前紀錄。聞某港商在穗之聯號，被緝去四百兩之多。據悉：由每道私運者，數量尤多，估計在二萬兩以上。港金銀貿易市塲，頃以廿七對廿四票決，停止今明兩日黃金買賣，待向財政司請示改善條例，再行決定營業方針，一般預料黃金市塲將移向澳門云。</p>
<h3>穗扣留運桂銀元　綏靖署已允放行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕廣州綏署扣運銀元，十七日經何院長電穗商洽結果，已告解決，此項銀元係中央銀行運至廣州轉運至桂林柳州等地發軍餉者，　綏署已允放行。</p>
<h3>于右任七一華誕　李代總統昨晨親往祝賀　晚在寓邸以桂元饗記者</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕十七日為于院長右任七十晋一壽辰，寗夏路二號于院長寓邸，十七日自晨至晚，賀客盈門。晨間于氏衣長袍馬褂，含笑接待客人。李代總統於晨十時親往祝壽，于氏握手時，連稱「不敢當不敢當！」狀至謙抑。何應欽·張羣·黃紹竑·閻錫山·白崇禧·童冠腎·翁文灝·徐永昌·劉攻芸·李璜·杭立武·端木傑·張知本·孫越崎·黃少谷·陳克文及立監委等數百人，均往祝賀。于氏午應各友好在馬祥與之壽宴，下午往遊陵園，漫步於梅花山，觀賞櫻花，樂也融融。晚復在寓邸備有桂元饗往賀之新聞記者。于氏笑語記者：「我每年都是想躱避，結果都避不了，把我的手都握腫了，今年還好，手算是沒有腫。」</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕于右任赴平期已一再延展，十七日並表示在黃紹竑返京所携回之方案尙待政府研究，故一二日內不致啟程。</p>
<h3>江北戰局明弛暗緊　共軍調動至忙從事新部署　高橋頭堡國軍昨復棄守</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕江北戰局明弛暗緊，陳毅陳賡兩部連日調動至忙，似在積極從事新的部署，凖備發動新的攻勢。又，龍潭對岸大河口東溝鎭一帶，近開到共軍萬餘，划子口及南岸國軍兵力因亦加强。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕屬於陳毅部之共軍第十六軍三個團，約八千餘，於十六日傍晚起，突自三江營頭橋鎭一帶向高橋國軍橋頭堡進犯，同時復集中重砲七門，向南岸大港龍山一帶轟擊，藉以遮斷高橋國軍後路阻滯南岸國軍增援，經該橋頭堡守軍闕漢騫部一個團奮勇阻擊後，至十七日黎明前，終以衆寡懸殊，乃在海軍艦艇掩護下主動撤至南岸。至此，由國軍收復僅四日之高橋橋頭堡曁老洲，復全部棄守。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江十七日電〕鎭江大港對江戰事又起，自十六日夜十時許，共軍以兩個團兵力猛烈圍攻四方橋守軍防地，至十七日下午戰事未停。又，東北對江三江營新洲高橋一帶復遭共軍廿六軍及廿三軍二團以上兵力進攻，十六晚九時起，以大砲開始轟擊，守軍奮勇抵禦，砲火異常熾烈，高橋陣地曾往返爭奪多次，激戰至十七日晚守軍已主動撤移，該地復陷共軍手中，現三江營及新洲兩地至發電時止，戰事仍在持續中，六圩十二圩瓜洲等地平靜</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江十七日電〕十七日拂曉四時許，共軍在老洲對南岸發砲多響，有三枚砲彈落於江南龜山頭爆炸，損失不詳。</p>
<p>〔本報蕪湖十七日電〕安慶城東郊農業學校棋盤山一帶，十六·十七日仍僅有稀疏砲戰，貴池西北對江之棕陽及安慶城西之山口，望江以南之華陽等，俱到有共軍大量船隻，似有凖備於和談破裂後隨時渡江模樣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山十六日電〕北平中共電台今日廣播稱：現駐北平之第四野戰軍已啟程南下，會同集中長江北岸之其他野戰軍準備渡江，完成全中國之最後解放工作。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十七日電〕長江沿岸戰事今日仍吿停滯，正等待和談之最後結果，僅安慶附近有砲戰，共軍在該區集中大批船隻，以供將來渡江之用。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕某高級軍事將領十七日論及共軍渡江要求時稱：共軍希望和平渡江，亦係鑒於武力渡江之不可恃。據渠根據實際數字估計，共軍如繼續作戰，最多能支持三個月，而國軍至少可支持六個月，其理由為共方亦感覺經濟上之困難而械彈補給尤為短缺，該高級將領認為萬一共軍從事武力渡江，亦非輕而易舉，國軍經數月之休息整頓，實力已漸恢復，目前國軍一個軍足可應付共軍兩個軍。渠認為長江天險猶可固守，但須指揮統一，尤其江南一切物力財力人力必須集中使用，則共軍武力渡江之迷夢勢難實現。</p>
<h3>幷郊繼續劇戰　共軍未獲寸進</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕軍息：共軍聶榮臻徐向前兩部，十六日夜起續向太原城郊進擊。共軍以兩日來傷亡甚重，今以城東傘兒樹·瓜地溝·楊家堡·親賢鎭等國軍陣地續遭共軍步兵二百餘來犯，皆經擊退外，餘皆改以砲為主，故城區居民死傷頗多，十七日午，陣地無變化。又，太原城西機塲，今雖亦遭共軍重砲轟擊，惟飛機仍勉可降落。</p>
<h3>李代總統咨立院　張承槱任審計長</h3>
<p>立院定期行使同意權</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕李代總統提名張承　充任審計部審計長，已依法咨請立院予以同意，立院定廿四日上午九時舉行第二次臨時會議，行使同意權。茲誌李代總統咨文如次：「查審計部審計長林雲陔，因病出缺返須遴員補充，以專責成，茲有張承　一員，行年六五，籍隸鄂省，留美華盛頓大學政治經濟系畢業，學行醇篤，器識宏深，辛亥致力革命，卓著功勛，嗣任審計部審計廳長，常務次長，及蘇，浙，湘，鄂審計處處長等職，逾二十年，績效尤彰，以之充任審計長，允稱適當，爰依憲法第一百零四條之規定，提請貴院同意，以憑任命為荷，此咨立法院，代總統李宗仁」。</p>
<h3>穩定財政金融　硏擬治本方案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕據財政權威方面息：穩定財政金融之治本方案，財政要員巳在着手研擬，日來甚囂塵上之實行銀本位，發行銀元券說，當局亦曾詳加考慮，並曾與專家研討，惟任何本位制度之實行，均必須有充分之凖備，並須政府握有充分之實力，同時尤須與其他條件配合始可着手。日前財長劉攻云列席立院報吿時，亦曾提及銀本位制度，劉氏認為以目前之支出計算，每月需銀幣一億二千萬元，故實行時尙有困難。</p>
<h3>麥卡倫指斥艾契遜　反對援助亞洲　顯係對蘇示弱　美援華款逾廿億說決非事實</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕民主黨參議員麥卡倫今日指斥國務院反對關於援助亞洲阻遏共產主義狂瀾之任何建議「顯對蘇聯示弱」，麥氏為十五億元援華新法案之發起人。先是共和黨議員勃里奇對於國務卿艾契遜之態度極表憤慨，要求國會澈查國務卿之對華政策，麥氏遂有上項聲明。據稱「當此國務院步共產宣傳路綫後塵而認中共領袖毛澤東並非眞正工產黨員之時，吾人必須有所作為。艾契遜昨日復函旣欠準確，又誤入歧途。所謂勝利以來美國全部援華經費已逾二十億元，決非事實。依照凖確統計，已執行之軍事援助總額共僅一億一千萬元，連同未執行者在內，亦僅二億三千五百萬元。其中去年四月一億二千五百萬元軍事援華法案規定裝出之物資遲至十月間始克首批啟運，以致未能及時援助中國政府抵抗共軍大規模攻勢，迭成目前局勢之後果。國務院一面全力援歐抵抗共產主義，一面强烈反對援助亞洲阻遏共產主義狂瀾之任何建議，此舉殊難理解。本人建議援助中國政府非欲為中國效勞，而係基於為美國自身利益計，對於亞洲共產主義有採取積極行動之迫切需要。如果共產主義統治全中國，必將進一步統治全亞洲。日本若不能取得中國市塲與糧食，美國由於無法供給日本八千五百萬人民以糧食與工業產物之市塲，勢將被迫放棄其在日本之地位。美國一旦退出日本，日人非餓斃卽入共產主義懷抱，舍此以外別無他途可循。共產主義統治日本後，第二步卽統治菲律賓。美國如果繼續抽手旁觀，定必喪失其世界和平曁民主之領袖地位，且其復興西歐抵抗共產主義之麗大努力亦將歸於徒然」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕國務卿艾契遜致參院外委會主席之信，十六日招致主張援華者之激烈抨擊，但觀察家相信，除非若干民主黨負與共和黨聯合，則將不致使國會採取立卽行動。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕國務院新聞處長麥克特莫十六日對民主黨參議員麥卡倫之聲明不願發表意見，備稱就余所知，國務院內無人曾言毛澤東並非眞正共產黨員。</p>

<h3>中交兩行的裁倂問題</h3>
<p>去歲立法院第一期會中，王力航委員等會提出收購中·交·農三銀行的商股問題，當時因時值動亂，不便多所更張，並沒有採納這部份的意見。不料時逾半載，王氏等舊事重提，並發表改組中央·中國兩行，裁撤交·農·信·郵·合等行局庫的主張。此外，原提案內，除對於改組後的中央銀行和中國銀行保留舊各稱外，其餘均須重起爐灶，與裁併無異。際此大局不安，金融動盪的局面下，上列各行局庫的體制，應否即有所變更，殊領吾人注意。</p>
<p>王力航原提案的着眼點，首在國家銀行官商股董監事由少數人所包辦，這一部份董監事的金融權力，超駕國家權力之上，因而禍國殃民。其次，王氏等以爲當前金融曲混亂和經濟的衰敝，其咎全在於國家銀行，而國家銀行的幕後策動者，又是那些把持南股的豪門巨富，所以須收回國家銀行的商股。最後王氏等更指出當前國家銀行在各稱上有八個之多，機構龐大，人員衆多，因之業務重複，虛耗公帑，故有裁併的必要。壬氏的各項論點，原不無針對時弊的地方，但在基本上却大有問題。</p>
<p>從我國國家銀行發展的歷史過程看，顯然的，中交兩行自成一體。它們在民國十七年前，同是實際掌握國家銀行任務的銀行，在一般人民印象中較爲深刻。中交兩行的歷史，都在四十年以上，中國銀行的前身，即是遜清的戶部銀行及大清銀行。交通銀行則自始至今，並未改變名稱。中央銀行未成立前，兩行是代理國庫及享有發行權的銀行，實握着當時我國金融的命脈。猶憶在北伐初期，金融情形異常混亂的局面中，它們一方面領導着商業銀行，與外商銀行競爭，一方面發行鈔券，維持信用，安定金融，從而安定社會人心，對於北伐的成功，貢獻甚多。及至十七年中央銀行成立之初，因央行信用未著，擠兌風潮，瀰漫全國，它們又協同支持中央銀行，渡過難關。至於迭次廢兩改元，改革法幣，發行債券，管理外匯等措施，平心而論，倘使沒有兩行的幫助，恐怕未必能如理想的順利，再說抗戰初期的統一發行，亦是由於兩行的探明大義，對於抗戰的實力確實增加不少。還並不是我們存心辯護，論大下事者總應有一些公道。</p>
<p>近年來所謂豪門的罪惡，固已人畫能言，但亦惟其如此。幾使人人可以拿豪門這頂帽子加諸所厭惡的人了。在此，所要論究的，國家行局的董監事是否盡爲豪門呢？按法，中交兩行的董監事，向例官股由政府指派，商股亦須經政府認可　才能產生，假使這些董監事果眞因中交兩行而成爲豪門的話，則其罪咎應在於過去行政措施的不當，何况董監事中亦未必盡爲豪門？此外，就客觀情勢而論，抗戰以後，中交兩行代庫權的取消，軍政機關存款及外匯的移交。一切特權。早已喪失殆盡，加之存放利率及頭寸運用等，在在受財政當局嚴厲的管制，而財政部則予取予求，中央銀行則發鈔漫無限制，禍國殃民的　結，固在此而不在彼。再說，中交兩行的成立，並非今日始，而所謂豪門的產生，則爲近數年間事，何以過去兩行沒有產生出豪門，而現在遽已變質？况且中交兩行在民國十七年以前股本的比例爲官二商八，那時大部實力都握在商股們的手裏，　反没有豪門，而現在實力大部操在政府的手裏，難道倒有豪門的產生，那不是奇蹟嗎？所以，若由王氏等提案的邏輯來推論，則今日果眞要打倒豪門，無寗使中央銀行而外，其他國家銀行的官股　應該全部退出，才能避免豪門涉足，杜絕擾亂金融的罪　，進而爲眞正的國民資本。</p>
<p>退一步說，身爲中交兩行商股的股東，這幾年來，他們非但没有沾着銀行的利益，而且因爲頻年戰禍，及政府一再剝削兩行的權益，使得他們的應得利益，也損失不小…例如中交兩行官商股的成份，民初原爲官二商八，廿四年中行才改爲官商各半，交行改爲官六商四，卅一二年兩行增資時，又因抗戰關係，商股股東散處各方不及同時辦理、共結果僅有官股的增加，因之中行官股增爲百分之六〇强，商股减爲百分之三三；交行官股增爲百分之八六，商股减爲百分之一三。再則歷次官股增加的股本，實際並没有付出現金，只不過是拿些公債等的頭寸來抵充，絕非商股當年所繳的銀元可比。現在公债的眞實價值如何，眞是天曉得…十年「八一九」幣制改革時，兩行的外匯頭寸，均已全數繳存央行，歷年代理政府所辦軍政免費匯款，及低利的國策貨款等的貢獻，也可以說是對原有商股的無窮的剝削。基於這許多因素，所以國家銀行的收益，就變成了相對的减少。我人看了近年以來中交兩行所發付的股息，遠不如其他投資的利潤，即可證明這種情形的不虛。商股股東所以要忍受這許多年來投資的損失，無非在希望承平以後，中交兩行能有復興的一天，今乃有不顧銀行從前資產，而酌給代價，强令商股取還股本的怪論，豈不令政府的信用掃地？長此鼓煽，必使人民視與政府合作一切事業爲畏途，於政府究有何益？</p>
<p>其實國家資本與豪門資本本來是截然不同的。國家資本是掌握在政府手中的一種資本，政府可以負責決定其投資事業一切的方針，反之，豪門資本是私人的產物，一切利害全憑他們自己去操縱。今日的中交兩行，名稱上雖有商股的存在，但因董監事由於政府的指派，故實際大權，仍是操諸在政府的手中，欲求中交兩行的人事健全，只要一紙命令，便可辦到，何必勞師動眾來改組裁併呢，况且中交兩行過去信用良好，在國外均設有分支機構，對於吸牧僑匯及辦理工商業進出口的擔保等，無疑的要便利不少，如一且改組爲純粹的國營銀行，依國際通例，其國外分支機構必難立足，尤非智者所當取。再，關於銀行本身的制度，世界趨勢，已均趨向於專業化，英·美·法等國不必論，即社會主義的蘇聯，亦何嘗能够例外？所以王氏等所提將各專業化的國家行局庫又回頭來改爲兼業化的主張，在理論方面，顯已不合當前的趨勢。</p>
<p>總之，在此動亂時期，除去不合法。不合理的機構以外，絕不宜多所變更，尤其是不顧客觀，祇憑主觀的變革，變爲亂之源，愈變愈亂，是必然的現象。金融界何嘗不是如此？就當前我國的金融情形而論，應求樹立國家信用，發揮現有機構的效能，取消一切易使資金逃避的硬性管制法令，從而爭取民心，吸牧僑資，以增加國富、反之，如若捨本逐末，未必能有多大的效果。以目前國庫的空虛，財政的支絀，政費及一切開支都不敷，何來餘力來收購各國家銀行的商股？若以增加發行作爲收購的資本，豈不又加深人民的痛苦？因此，我們認爲在當前改粗或裁併國家行局庫的措施，是毫無裨益於實際的。爲今之計，政府唯有趕快利用中交兩行的歷史與信譽，去創造金融史上嶄新的一頁，那才是安定金融的坦途。</p>

<h3>禮砲隆隆教堂鐘聲齊鳴　愛爾蘭共和國誕生　數百萬人民狂歡慶祝達旦　奧凱利總統接掌政權今晨舉行閱兵</h3>
<p>〔路透社杜白林十八日電〕昨日午夜杜白林奧康奈爾橋的廿一響禮砲，各教堂齊鳴的鐘聲，及全國數百萬人民的歡呼，點綴了愛爾蘭獨立共和國的誕生。杜白林城內各地數十座強力探照燈，發出白色電光，在天空交織成美麗的花紋。愛爾蘭的大部份人民，昨夜幾均未睡，以慶祝愛爾蘭之脫離了英共和聯邦。倫敦的愛爾蘭人也在午夜參加國內同胞的狂歡。自午夜起，愛爾蘭總統奧凱利開始接掌英王喬治六世對於愛爾蘭的一切職權，自彼時起，在英國及參加英軍的愛爾蘭人，技術上成爲「外國人」，不過根據先前的諒解，這一個問題尚待他日確定。今日早晨愛爾蘭的三色國旗，已高懸在政府大廈之上，及一九一六年二千名愛爾蘭共和志願軍起義之處。郵政局前掛着四面銅牌，代表愛爾蘭的四省，包括「已失去的」北愛爾蘭烏爾斯特省在內。奧凱利總統早晨閱兵後，下午在孔雀公園官邸招待外交團，晚間則在杜白林別墅舉行盛大跳舞會。愛爾蘭色彩極濃厚的紐約，亦在大西洋的彼岸慶祝愛爾蘭共和國的獨立。愛爾蘭血統的紐約市長奧杜維發表演說，促英人退出北愛爾蘭以完成愛爾蘭的統一。英國已以寬大的態度，接受了愛爾蘭的完全脫離英共和國聯邦。杜白林的英國高級專員公署已於午夜起撤銷，代以大使館，不過北愛爾蘭不許有任何慶祝儀式的舉行，當局並嚴密戒備防止意外。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕此間伊朗大使館發言人稱，蘇聯對於伊朗或對美軍事團之駐在伊朗如有任何不滿，應根據聯合國憲章，向聯合國申訴。伊朗政府認爲一九二一年蘇伊條約內，准許蘇聯軍隊在某種情形下開入伊朗之規定，已被聯合國憲章內處理對於和平及安全威脅的規定所代替。按一九二一年蘇伊條約之第六條，曾規定如第三者欲利用伊朗土地作爲對蘇作戰基地，以威脅蘇聯邊界，而伊朗政府經蘇聯促其注意並行動後，仍不能制止此等對於蘇聯的威脅時，蘇聯有權派軍開入伊朗。自聯合國憲章產生以後，已有聯合國機構處理一切對於和平及安全的威脅，該第六條之規定，自不能繼續適用云。按伊大使館之發表聲明，係在傳稱蘇伊政府就美軍事團駐在伊朗及伊朗反對蘇聯對伊頻施壓力事，業已數度交換照會之後。惟伊使館發言人同時亦聲明，伊大使館方面並未接獲關於蘇伊間互遞照會之報告，至於大使館發言人之談話，亦僅就該問題之一般性釋明伊朗政府之立塲而已。</p>

<h3>漲風吹向菜塲　豬牛肉每斤六萬　時鮮貨銀元開價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日天雨，漲風又吹向小菜塲，各項葷素小菜，無不瘋狂上漲，一二日間普遍漲起一倍至二倍。豬牛肉每斤已抬高至六萬元，時鮮貨大明蝦，竟有以袁頭銀元開價者，每對索值三角，按買賣時袁大頭行市折付金圓券，昨晨每對喊五萬四千元。而各路銀牛，近爲搜購主婦手中積蓄之袁大頭計，頗多於清早滲入各小菜塲持鈔收購，故小菜塲之袁大頭行市隨詢即得。僅當令之小黃魚，價尚平定，每斤自四千元至六千元不等。青魚桂魚之類，每兩即在千元以上，已成富家之奢侈品。鷄鴨蛋則視大小，每隻有四千元至六千元等數檔價格。素菜漲勢尤凶，起碼之小塘菜每斤竟索二千元，竹筍六千元，毛筍四千元，黃菉豆芽發芽豆及鹹菜等，每斤約需四五千元。</p>
<p>又昨爲外國清明，基督教徒中上階級之家，習俗咸喜以巧克力糖製之清明蛋相饋贈，該蛋價格之昂，更屬驚人。普通如一枚鷄蛋大小者需五萬元，稍大者每顆有索價至卅萬元者。</p>
<h3>指數計薪制度難堪再用　市總工會要求變更辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金圓券驚人速度貶值，物價瘋狂上漲聲中，月中市府所發表之生活指數已成爲時代之諷刺。依指數計薪之全市百餘萬薪水階級，已再不堪低工資高物價之雙重煎逼，市總工會對此種情形連日曾一再秘密商討。茲悉：總工會代表於本月十五日市府生活費指數編製審議會中，即曾提出，要求成立一小組委員會研究今後計算工資標準。現行「平均指數」計薪制度實已不能再繼續使用，否則將召致嚴重後果，並限此小組於五天內（二十日以前）召開會議，擬具今後發薪標準具體方案，提交市政會議通過後，在本月卅日以前公布施行。當時編審會中資方及政府代表咸認爲，編審會之職權僅限於生活費指數編製之審議，無權商討此一提案，乃決議將此案授權統計長褚一飛向市府陳代市長提出要求變更計薪制度。昨據市總工會負責人語本報記者：謂本市工界對本月上期指數之科學性及準確性，絕對信任，各業工會對指數反應亦極良好，惟此項平均指數計薪制度實已不能再繼續維持，舉例言之，本月十五日本市米價已七十五萬元一石，五十元底薪之工人，其薪水照一萬五千一百四十倍指數計算，所得僅七十五萬七千元，僅够買米一石，而五十元金圓在去年八月十九日改革幣制時，至少可買米二石半，平均指數計薪制度已爲時代淘汰，由此已可見一斑。並謂：市總工會之提議，五天內或尚不及提出商討，但相信在本月底以前必有解決辦法云。</p>
<h3>社局改進商民公共利益　擬訂管理各業市塲規則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局爲加強市塲管理，改善交易方式，增進商民之公共利益起見，曾擬訂「上海市社會局管理各業市塲規則草案」，此項草案業已呈送市政府核准後施行。昨據社局王處長稱：各市塲負責人聞訊後，業已前來接洽登記手續，至該案內容大致如次：（一）市塲以隸屬於各該業同業公會，或由有關同業公會共同管轄爲原則，定名爲「上海市○○業市塲」，前項市塲名稱，如有特殊情形必須酌予變更者，應專案呈請社局核定。（二）市塲非經該管公會會員大會或理事會之通過及本局之許可，不得籌設。（三）市塲經許可籌設後，該管公會應即召開理事會，推選市塲籌備委員，擬訂市塲管理委員會組織章程，市塲管理委員會辦事細則及市塲營業規則草案，呈請社局核准施行。（四）市塲管理委員由該管公會會員大會，或理事會，或參加市塲之代表人大會推選，如係有關各業聯合籌設者，由有關各業公會比例推選。（五）市塲應俟領得社局頒發之市塲登記證後，始得定期開業。（六）凡經中央或社局核准登記幷已加入同業公會之公司行號工廠，均得推派代表人一至三人，參加市塲交易。（七）凡申請參加市塲之代表人，應向市塲管理委員會請領市塲證，無證不得入塲。（八）市塲所需經費，由市塲管理委員會造具預算，議定籌措辦法，提請該管公會理事會或有關公會理事長，常務理事，聯席會議通過後實施呈報社局備案。（九）市塲會計人員應由該管公會或有關公會同意選派。（十）市塲如有經紀人居間交易者，其身份及佣金之標準，應於市塲營業規則內詳爲規定，凡經呈准，不得變更。（十一）市塲交易以本業範圍內之現貨爲限，如有以棧單先行交易之必要時，應於成交後一個月內提貨，並不得以棧單輾轉交易。（十二）市塲交易如有違犯法令及團體規約者，由市塲管理委員會層報社局核辦。（十三）市塲交易如發生糾紛時，由市塲管理委員會調處，必要時得另組調解委員會處理之，前項調解委員會組織章程及調解規則，由市塲管理委員會另行擬訂，呈請社局核准施行。（十四）社局得視需要分派人員，常駐各市塲指導監督其交易。（十五）市塲交易價格及供銷情形，應按日或按週呈報社局備查。（十六）社局爲加強聯繫起見，得分知本市轄境內由中央直接管理之市塲，將組織及業務情形函報社局備查。（十七）本規則施行前業經社局核准或自行設立之市塲，應於一個月內補具各項章則，向社局請領市塲登記證，逾期不領者，撤銷其核准之原案，並停止其交易。</p>

<h3>佘山管領九峯　是春遊好去處　黃昏最美天暗雲低晚風絲絲</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕佘山，這一個距上海衹有一小時半行程的春遊去處，對大部份市民想來是不太陌生的。四月春深，山脚下經常停滿了各式來自市區內的汽車，許多人在這裏打發了他的週末和假日。</p>
<p>依照鑑賞風景的觀點來看，佘山之能成爲春遊勝境，並不完全在具備一座教堂以及名震三省的天文台，而是它本身隱居諸峯之長，峻拔地領導着環繞在它週圍的那許多辰山，羅山，薛山，天馬山，小箕山，鳳凰山，雄踞着太湖濱東區域所謂「九峯」的中央。在山嶺，極目遠眺，雲嵐迷離中，峯巒相屬，靜靜地偎依着一片江南大平原。間或遠處有一渠如帶，掩映三五農家，旁邊是菜花似錦。這景色，確實足够使人低徊無已的。</p>
<p>佘山九峯評　　就沿海各地的山色來評　佘山九峯；它稍遜於南京　山的瑰偉，略輸於武康莫干的秀逸，蘇州靈岩天平的山頭較它多一點點綴，北平香山的大環境較它幽邃嫻雅，而像台灣日月潭等山地有車道直通峯際，則它又似乎缺少一點近代化的外貌。但僅這已經够使埋首錙銖的都市兒女們悅目賞心了，朝發夕返，浮生半日，幾小時的留連，至少可以把利慾塵囂沖淡一下的。</p>
<p>佘山最美的境界是在黃昏時分，天暗雲低，叢莾中透出絲絲晚風，西方一抹紅霞，輝映着沉寂的原野；這時偶然走過一位神父，黑袍子裏面裹着瘦長的身影，挾着一本書，靜靜地，在晚禱鐘聲中拾級登山。看過王摩詰「細雨騎　過劍門」的人，對這份詩意一定可以體會得到的。</p>
<p>毫無市儈氣息　也許是湖山幸事吧，直到目前爲止，佘山九峯區域還沒有像西湖那樣，受市儈們的垂青。名勝地帶毫無濃重的商業氣息確實是可喜的，不用說廣告路牌咖啡館了，佘山之麓連一個像樣的冷飲攤都沒有。爬山的人口喝了，牽牛的村婦便上來兜售荸薺，這對於帶着大批金圓來遊春的都市兒女們當然是個諷刺。也正因爲如此，每年春秋兩季佘山遊客中，平均總是外僑較多。他們的遊山方式異常爽朗，一下車，脫了上衣，便成羣地向那沒有石級的山腰爬，到達峯巔，朝天空揚一揚手，連最年老的人也感到自己變得年青了。</p>
<p>佘山九峯中有幾座山是以產石聞名的，江南海塘每年的修建工程，龍華機塲過去的翻造，市區內各馬路的彈街石片，全部石塊都是由這幾座山頭採運的。上海佘山的公路有兩條，青滬路和松滬路，前者的路面較後者理想，而且被譽爲蘇省優級縣道。其經常在養路整修工作就是依賴這九峯山石，就地取材，因此能保持路面的完整。</p>
<p>山頂教堂歷盡滄桑</p>
<p>矗立在佘山上的天主教大教堂，也可以說是一座歷盡興亡的建築了。教堂頂端有一尊距浦江水平數千呎的耶穌銅像，在十字架上垂首俯視，幾十年來，他曾經看到北伐軍整隊經過山麓去攻佔上海，他也曾看到日本兵在對山砲轟國軍陣地，現在他又看到了許多地方團隊正在山脚下操練。湖山依舊，悠悠的白雲好像總是在爲時間的紀錄作證，但人事滄桑，我們這一代的悲哀恐怕在耶穌眼中也已瞧够了吧！</p>

<h3>燃料進口絡繹不絕　煤萬八千餘噸先後運滬　麵粉易煤共方免予徴稅</h3>

<h3>黃浦江中撈獲女屍一具</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕水上警分局於昨日下午六時，在黃浦公園前浦江中，撈獲女屍一具，年約卅餘歲，燙髪，外穿咖啡呢大衣，內着淡黃絨綫衫，花夾旗袍，白洋布短衫褲，褲外罩紅絨綫短褲，下穿長統襪，高統套鞋，惟衣袋中一無長物，該屍當晚暫送同仁輔元堂南碼頭救生局，待今晨報地檢處檢驗。</p>

<h3>市長盃·殊死戰　二次延長時間　康隊力克培爾　餘勝健樂四七比三五　女子組黎隊贏力隊五球</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市長盃籃球賽，昨晚女子組黎隊勝力隊，廿四比十四。男子組兩塲，康隊於第二次延長時期方以四四比四一勝培爾，上半時十一比十四，培爾領前三分。比賽殺搏緊張，殊所罕見。培爾五次犯規，「畢業」六個，和那八次「暫停」，都創着新紀錄。第三塲仁餘勝健樂，四七比卅五，上半時廿九比十五。昨夕雖雨打風吹，球迷依然熱烈捧塲。</p>
<p>·黎隊勝力隊·</p>
<p>黎隊對力隊之女子組賽，爲昨晚第一塲，黎隊蔡明霞及錢氏姊妹連獲五分，姚思濂亦殊精采，第一節使力隊吃『鴨蛋』，也可以說昨晚力隊失敗的主要原因。第二節黎隊陳玉琴代姚，朱翠棣代幽屏，力隊翁霞雲范玉英一罰一擲共三分，將剛才那隻『鴨蛋』原璧奉趙，蓋黎隊本節亦空無所得，觀眾不覺哄堂大笑。第三節黎隊復凶，力隊的一再更調，並未見效，成十四比五。</p>
<p>第四節力隊自姚文達替出梁妙珍後，她們一連數球，使黎隊諸將有『莫名其妙』的表情，這一次採用男子規則，事前沒有充份宣傳和準備，故各隊很多不能『應付裕如』，幾個幼小的球員，她們自己在說『吃勿消』，結果黎隊以廿四比十四勝。</p>

<h3>The Success or Failure of Peace Talks Hangs by a Thread. A Tense and Heavy Atmosphere in Nanjing. The Government Closely Studies the CCP's Demands</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to the CCP's radio station in Beiping on the 17th, today is the 17th day of the peace talks. From April 1st to 12th, the CCP delegation and the Nanjing delegation, after frequent contact and exchange of opinions, drafted a domestic peace agreement. On the 13th, the two delegations held a formal meeting in the Forbidden City. The CCP delegation explained the CCP's position and the reasons for the draft agreement. The Nanjing delegation expressed its own position and opinions on the draft agreement. On the 15th, the two sides held a second formal meeting. The CCP delegation delivered the final revised version of the agreement to the Nanjing delegation. The full text of the agreement consists of eight articles and twenty-four clauses, which not only adopted the opinions of the Nanjing delegation, but also actively provided opinions from the leading figures of various democratic parties. At the meeting between the two sides on the 15th, the CCP delegation announced that the deadline for the negotiations was April 20th. Whether the Nanjing delegation is willing to sign the agreement must be indicated before April 20th. April 20th is the signing date. At 11:00 a.m. on the 16th, the Nanjing delegation sent representative Huang Shaohong and advisor Qu Wu to fly to Nanjing to ask the Nanjing government for instructions. The reply from Nanjing is now being awaited.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] It has been confirmed that the two demands made by the CCP, namely the establishment of a joint organization in politics and the immediate crossing of the Yangtze River in military affairs, are the most important parts of the eight articles and twenty-four clauses proposed by the CCP. When discussing all the clauses, some issues can be negotiated and compromises can be made on both sides, but the above two points have become the focus of difficulty, especially the short time limit, which adds to the difficulty. It is said that the joint organization referred to is named the Control Committee, which is composed of representatives from both sides and has the full power to replace the current government. As for the request to cross the Yangtze River, it is hoped that it will be realized as soon as possible to implement the reorganization of the army and "ensure peace talks." The first article of the eight conditions was originally to punish war criminals. After consultation, the original proposal has been abandoned and is no longer insisted, but it is explained who is responsible for the war crimes, that President Chiang must go abroad, and that certain people listed as war criminals must not participate in the future joint government.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Acting President Li will not accept the two demands proposed by the CCP in the eight articles and twenty-four clauses, namely the organization of a joint organization and the crossing of the Yangtze River by the Communist army. This reporter obtained this hint when interviewing someone close to Acting President Li on the 17th. The person admitted that the biggest difficulty at present is the above two points. After emphasizing that "the government will never surrender," he declared: "The Communist army must not cross the Yangtze River. If the Communist army crosses the Yangtze River, nothing can be discussed."</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] It is reported that the draft peace agreement of eight articles and twenty-four clauses brought back by Huang Shaohong from Beiping is now being secretly studied by the government. Acting President Li, Premier He, Zhang Qun, Bai Chongxi, Yan Xishan, Wu Zhongxin, Xu Yongchang, etc., have been in close contact for the 16th and 17th, discussing countermeasures. It is reported that Wu Tiecheng, who is in Shanghai, has gone to Xikou at the invitation of Acting President Li to ask President Chiang for instructions on the draft peace agreement in order to make a final decision. The CCP requires signing on April 20th. The government's countermeasure will be decided as soon as possible before the 20th, and then Huang Shaohong will be sent to Beiping to continue negotiations with the CCP by the government delegation.</p>
<h3>After the Government's Countermeasures are Determined, Huang Shaohong will Immediately Return to Beiping. There is No Problem with the Third Party's Transportation to Beiping.</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Huang Shaohong's return to Beiping will be delayed. He will wait in Nanjing for the government's decision on the draft peace agreement proposed by the CCP. During Huang's stay in Beiping, he held meetings every day or had contact with people from all walks of life, which did not end until 2:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. He was overworked and his blood pressure rose sharply. After returning to Nanjing on the 16th, because all the reports were written documents, Huang only gave a brief explanation, and then Acting President Li and Premier He studied them together. Huang Shaohong plans to have a full rest in the next few days. On the morning of the 17th, in addition to attending Yu Youren's birthday celebration, he only went to He Yingqin's official residence for a meeting and then returned to Fuhougang for rest.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Regarding the CCP's invitation to third-party figures such as Zhang Lan to go to Beiping, the government has agreed to provide transportation convenience. The government will provide airplanes for those who accept the CCP's invitation and want to go. It is reported that the CCP's invitation was forwarded by the government delegation, and the government has informed Zhang et al. that in addition to the people designated by the CCP, it also stated that if there are remaining seats on the plane to Beiping, anyone who wants to go can go. In addition to Zhang Lan, Luo Longji, Ye Duyi, Shi Liang, Yang Weiyu, Leng, etc., there are also Guo Zeshen, Luo Hanxian, and Wang Genzhong.</p>
<h3>The Price of a Cup of Tea in a Beiping Dance Hall is 100 People's Currency</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] This reporter recently met with the personnel on the China National Aviation Corporation's aircraft No. 515 who returned to Shanghai from Beiping the day before yesterday. I would like to briefly describe the recent situation in Beiping:</p>
<p>After they arrived in Beiping, they stayed at the Six Nations Hotel, and the expenses were paid by the CCP. The food was very good, and they could choose between Chinese and Western food, and there was no shortage of chicken, duck, fish, and meat. Their movements were also very free.</p>
<p>The clothing of the CCP's senior leaders is very ordinary, and even close to tattered. What they saw, such as Ye Jianying, from the outside, you would never think that he is a general.</p>
<p>There is now air traffic between Beiping and Jinan and Zhengzhou. There are C46 aircraft flying between Beiping and Jinan, and C47 aircraft flying between Beiping and Zhengzhou.</p>
<p>The Beiping market is stable but depressed. Most shops have sluggish business. Most of the people on the street are dressed plainly, and women mostly wear cloth clothes. However, luxury goods can still be bought as long as you have money.</p>
<p>Dance halls are still open, and the price of tea is 100 people's currency per cup. A gentleman spent three hours inside and gave the dancer 300 people's currency.</p>
<p>The exchange rate between gold yuan and people's currency has recently been 120 to 1. One silver dollar is equivalent to 230 people's currency.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi's Nephew Accompanied Huang Shaohong to Nanjing.</h3>
<p>Hai Jingqiang was Released after Being Captured and Sent Back.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Accompanying Huang Shaohong on the special plane to Nanjing on the 16th was Hai Jingqiang, Bai Chongxi's nephew. Hai was the commander of a certain division. He was captured while fighting with the Communist army and was recently released and sent back. Hai was considered a mysterious guest at the airport because he refused to reveal his name.</p>
<h3>The Xinxiang Post Office Sends a Representative to Contact the Communist Side to Open Postal Services.</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Xinxiang on the 16th] The local post office sent inspector Wang Zhicheng and a postman on the 14th, carrying the post office's official letter and a small amount of mail, to Xiaoji Town to discuss technical issues of postal communication between the Kuomintang and Communist areas with the Communist side. The post office hopes that the Communist side will assist in opening a postal route between Xinxiang and Xiaoji. If the Communist side agrees, the Anyang Post Office also plans to contact the Communist side to discuss postal services.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Gold from Hong Kong to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>A Thousand Taels Seized on the Yuehan Train</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 17th] The Industrial and Commercial Evening News today reported that, according to customs sources, the smuggling of gold from Hong Kong to Guangzhou is extremely rampant. On the 16th alone, the Yuehai Customs seized one thousand taels of smuggled gold on the Yuehan train, breaking the previous record. It is said that a certain Hong Kong merchant's branch in Guangzhou was seized with more than 400 taels. It is reported that the number of smugglers is even greater, estimated to be more than 20,000 taels. The Hong Kong gold and silver trading market recently decided by a vote of 27 to 24 to suspend gold trading for today and tomorrow, pending a request to the Financial Secretary to improve the regulations before deciding on the business policy. It is generally expected that the gold market will move to Macau.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Detains Silver Dollars Transported to Guangxi. The Pacification Headquarters Has Agreed to Release Them.</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] The Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters' detention of silver dollars was resolved on the 17th after Premier He telegraphed Guangzhou to discuss the matter. These silver dollars were transported by the Central Bank to Guangzhou for transshipment to Guilin, Liuzhou, and other places to pay military salaries. After learning of the detention, the Guangxi Provincial Assembly and people's organizations expressed great indignation and are said to be making serious representations. The Pacification Headquarters has agreed to release them.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren's 71st Birthday. Acting President Li Personally Went to Congratulate Him Yesterday Morning. In the Evening, He Treated Reporters with Guilin Yuan in His Residence.</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] The 17th was the 71st birthday of President Yu Youren. President Yu's residence at No. 2 Ningxia Road was filled with guests from morning to night on the 17th. In the morning, Mr. Yu was dressed in a long gown and mandarin jacket, and greeted guests with a smile. Acting President Li personally went to congratulate him at 10:00 a.m. When Mr. Yu shook hands, he repeatedly said, "I dare not, I dare not!" His demeanor was extremely modest. He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Huang Shaohong, Yan Xishan, Bai Chongxi, Tong Guanshen, Weng Wenhao, Xu Yongchang, Liu Gongyun, Li Huang, Hang Liwu, Duanmu Jie, Zhang Zhiben, Sun Yueqi, Huang Shaogu, Chen Kewen, and hundreds of members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan all went to congratulate him. Mr. Yu attended a birthday banquet with friends at Ma Xiang at noon, and in the afternoon, he visited the Mausoleum and strolled on Meihua Mountain to admire the cherry blossoms. He was very happy. In the evening, he prepared Guilin Yuan in his residence to entertain news reporters who came to congratulate him. Mr. Yu said to reporters with a smile: "I want to avoid it every year, but I can't avoid it. My hands are swollen from shaking hands. This year is better, my hands are not swollen."</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Yu Youren's trip to Beiping has been postponed again and again. He stated on the 17th that the plan brought back by Huang Shaohong still needs to be studied by the government, so he will not leave in a day or two.</p>
<h3>The Battle Situation North of the Yangtze River is Apparently Relaxed but Secretly Tense. The Communist Army is Busy with New Deployments. The National Army Abandoned the Gaoqiao Stronghold Again Yesterday.</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] The battle situation north of the Yangtze River is apparently relaxed but secretly tense. Chen Yi and Chen Geng's troops have been busy with deployments in recent days, and seem to be actively engaged in new deployments to prepare for a new offensive. In addition, more than 10,000 Communist troops have recently arrived in the Dahekou Donggou Town area across from Longtan, and the National Army's forces in Huazikou and the south bank have also been strengthened.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Three regiments of the 16th Army of the Communist Army belonging to Chen Yi's troops, about 8,000 people, suddenly advanced towards the National Army's Gaoqiao bridgehead from the Sanjiangying Touqiao Town area starting in the evening of the 16th. At the same time, they concentrated seven heavy artillery pieces to bombard the Dagang Longshan area on the south bank, in order to cut off the National Army's retreat from Gaoqiao and block the National Army's reinforcements from the south bank. After a regiment of the garrison force of the bridgehead, under the command of Que Hanqian, fought bravely to resist, by dawn on the 17th, due to the disparity in numbers, they took the initiative to withdraw to the south bank under the cover of naval vessels. At this point, the Gaoqiao bridgehead and Laozhou, which had been recovered by the National Army for only four days, were completely abandoned again.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang on the 17th] The battle across the river from Dagang, Zhenjiang, has started again. Since about 10:00 p.m. on the 16th, the Communist army has launched a fierce attack on the defense area of the Sifangqiao garrison with two regiments. The fighting had not stopped by the afternoon of the 17th. In addition, the Sanjiangying Xinzhou Gaoqiao area in the northeast across the river was attacked again by the 26th Army and the 23rd Army of the Communist Army with more than two regiments. Starting at 9:00 p.m. on the 16th, they began to bombard with artillery. The garrison fought bravely to resist, and the artillery fire was extremely fierce. The Gaoqiao position was fought back and forth many times. In the fierce battle until the evening of the 17th, the garrison had taken the initiative to withdraw, and the area fell into the hands of the Communist army again. At the time of reporting, the fighting was still continuing in Sanjiangying and Xinzhou, while Liuyi, Shierwei, and Guazhou were calm.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang on the 17th] At about 4:00 a.m. on the 17th, the Communist army fired many shells at the south bank from Laozhou. Three shells landed and exploded on Guishan Mountain on the south bank, with unknown losses.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Wuhu on the 17th] On the 16th and 17th, there were only sparse artillery battles in the Qipan Mountain area of the Agricultural School in the eastern suburbs of Anqing. A large number of Communist army ships were seen in Zongyang across the river in the northwest of Guichi and Shankou in the west of Anqing, and Huayang in the south of Wangjiang, as if they were preparing to cross the river at any time after the peace talks broke down.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 16th] The CCP radio station in Beiping broadcasted today that the Fourth Field Army stationed in Beiping has set off south to join other field armies concentrated on the north bank of the Yangtze River to prepare to cross the river and complete the final liberation of all of China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] The fighting along the Yangtze River remained at a standstill today, awaiting the final result of the peace talks. There was only artillery fire near Anqing, where the Communist army concentrated a large number of ships for future use in crossing the river.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] A senior military general stated on the 17th, when discussing the Communist army's request to cross the river, that the Communist army hoped to cross the river peacefully because they also realized the unreliability of crossing the river by force. According to his estimates based on actual figures, the Communist army can support it for a maximum of three months if they continue to fight, while the National Army can support it for at least six months. The reason is that the Communist side also feels economic difficulties and is particularly short of ammunition supplies. The senior general believes that it is not easy for the Communist army to cross the river by force. After several months of rest and reorganization, the strength of the National Army has gradually recovered. At present, one army of the National Army is enough to deal with two armies of the Communist Army. He believes that the Yangtze River's natural barrier can still be defended, but the command must be unified, especially all the material, financial, and human resources in the south of the Yangtze River must be used in a concentrated manner, then the Communist army's dream of crossing the river by force will be difficult to realize.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Continue in the Suburbs of Taiyuan. The Communist Army Has Not Made an Inch of Progress.</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Military News: The Communist army's troops under Nie Rongzhen and Xu Xiangqian continued to attack the suburbs of Taiyuan from the night of the 16th. Because the Communist army has suffered heavy casualties in the past two days, today the National Army's positions in Sanershu, Guadigou, Yangjiabao, and Qinxiantown in the east of the city continued to be attacked by more than 200 Communist infantrymen, all of whom were repelled. The rest were mainly artillery fire, so many residents in the urban area were killed and injured. At noon on the 17th, there was no change in the position. In addition, the airport west of Taiyuan City was also bombarded by heavy artillery fire by the Communist army today, but the planes can still barely land.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li Consults the Legislative Yuan on the Appointment of Zhang Chengyu as Auditor-General.</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan Will Exercise the Right of Consent at a Regular Meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Acting President Li's nomination of Zhang Chengyu to fill the position of Auditor-General of the Audit Department has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for consent in accordance with the law. The Legislative Yuan will hold its second extraordinary meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th to exercise the right of consent. The text of Acting President Li's letter is as follows: "The position of Auditor-General of the Audit Department, Lin Yungaai, is vacant due to illness and needs to be filled by a replacement to take responsibility. There is now one person, Zhang Chengyu, age 65, from Hubei Province, a graduate of the Department of Political Economy of Washington University in the United States. He has a pure character and profound knowledge. He devoted himself to the revolution in 1911 and made outstanding contributions. He then served as the Director of the Audit Office, Permanent Deputy Minister, and Director of the Audit Offices of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Hubei for more than 20 years, with outstanding performance. It is appropriate to appoint him as Auditor-General. In accordance with the provisions of Article 104 of the Constitution, I hereby submit this to your esteemed Yuan for consent in order to appoint him. This is hereby submitted to the Legislative Yuan, Acting President Li Zongren."</p>
<h3>Studying Fundamental Solutions to Stabilize Finance</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] According to financial authority sources: Financial officials have already begun to study fundamental solutions to stabilize finance. The authorities have also considered and discussed with experts the rampant rumors of implementing the silver standard and issuing silver dollar notes. However, the implementation of any standard system must have sufficient preparation, and the government must have sufficient strength. At the same time, it must be started in coordination with other conditions. When Finance Minister Liu Gongyun attended the Legislative Yuan to report the other day, he also mentioned the silver standard system. Mr. Liu believes that the current expenditure requires 120 million silver coins per month, so there are still difficulties in implementing it.</p>
<h3>Senator McCarran Accuses Acheson of Opposing Aid to Asia. Apparently Showing Weakness to the Soviet Union. The Claim that US Aid to China Exceeds 2 Billion is Definitely Not True.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Democratic Senator McCarran today accused the State Department of opposing any proposals regarding aid to Asia to stem the tide of communism, "apparently showing weakness to the Soviet Union." Mr. McCarran is the initiator of the new $1.5 billion aid to China bill. Earlier, Republican Senator Bridges expressed extreme anger at Secretary of State Acheson's attitude and demanded that Congress thoroughly investigate the Secretary of State's China policy. Mr. McCarran then made the above statement. It is said that "at this time when the State Department is following in the footsteps of communist propaganda and recognizing that the CCP leader Mao Zedong is not a true communist, we must do something. Secretary Acheson's reply yesterday was both inaccurate and misleading. The so-called total US aid to China since victory has exceeded $2 billion is definitely not true. According to accurate statistics, the total amount of military aid that has been implemented is only $110 million, including those that have not been implemented, it is only $235 million. Among them, the materials stipulated in last year's April $125 million military aid to China bill did not start to be shipped until October, so that the Chinese government could not be assisted in time to resist the large-scale offensive of the Communist army, which resulted in the current situation. The State Department is making every effort to aid Europe to resist communism, while strongly opposing any proposals to aid Asia to stem the tide of communism, which is difficult to understand. My proposal to aid the Chinese government is not to serve China, but based on the interests of the United States itself, there is an urgent need to take active action against communism in Asia. If communism dominates all of China, it will further dominate all of Asia. If Japan cannot obtain the Chinese market and food, the United States will be forced to abandon its position in Japan because it cannot supply the 85 million people of Japan with food and industrial products. Once the United States withdraws from Japan, the Japanese people will either starve to death or embrace communism, there is no other way. After communism dominates Japan, the second step is to dominate the Philippines. If the United States continues to stand by, it will definitely lose its leadership position in world peace and democracy, and its great efforts to revive Western Europe to resist communism will be in vain."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] Secretary of State Acheson's letter to the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 16th drew fierce criticism from those who advocated aid to China, but observers believe that unless some Democrats join forces with the Republicans, Congress will not take immediate action.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] State Department Press Officer McDermott declined to comment on Democratic Senator McCarran's statement on the 16th, stating that to the best of his knowledge, no one in the State Department had ever said that Mao Zedong was not a true communist.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Problem of Merging the Central and Communications Banks</h3>
<p>During the first session of the Legislative Yuan last year, Member Wang Lihang and others proposed the issue of acquiring the commercial shares of the Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks. At that time, due to the turbulent times, it was inconvenient to make many changes, and this part of the opinion was not adopted. Unexpectedly, after more than half a year, Wang and others brought up the old matter again and proposed reorganizing the Central and China Banks and abolishing the Communications, Farmers, Trust, Postal, and Cooperative Banks and Treasuries. In addition, in the original proposal, except for retaining the old names of the reorganized Central Bank and Bank of China, all the others had to start anew, which was no different from merging. In the current situation of great instability and financial turmoil, whether the system of the above-mentioned banks and treasuries should be changed immediately deserves our attention.</p>
<p>The focus of Wang Lihang's original proposal was first that the state-owned and commercial shareholders, directors, and supervisors of state banks were monopolized by a small number of people, and the financial power of these directors and supervisors exceeded the power of the state, thus harming the country and the people. Secondly, Wang and others believed that the current financial chaos and economic decline were entirely the fault of the state banks, and the behind-the-scenes instigators of the state banks were those wealthy tycoons who controlled the commercial shares, so the commercial shares of the state banks must be recovered. Finally, Wang and others pointed out that there are currently as many as eight state banks in name, with large institutions and numerous personnel, resulting in overlapping business and wasting public funds, so there is a need for merging. Wang's various arguments were not without pointing out the shortcomings of the time, but there were fundamental problems in the basics.</p>
<p>Looking at the historical development process of state banks in our country, it is clear that the Central and Communications Banks have become one. Before the 17th year of the Republic of China, they were the banks that actually grasped the task of the state bank, and their impression in the minds of the general public was deeper. The history of the Central and Communications Banks is more than 40 years. The predecessor of the Bank of China was the Ministry of Household Bank and the Bank of Great Qing of the late Qing Dynasty. The Bank of Communications has not changed its name from beginning to end. Before the establishment of the Central Bank, the two banks were agents of the national treasury and enjoyed the right of issuance, actually holding the lifeline of our country's finance at that time. It is still remembered that in the early days of the Northern Expedition, in the extremely chaotic financial situation, they led commercial banks to compete with foreign banks on the one hand, and issued banknotes to maintain credit and stabilize finance on the other hand, thereby stabilizing people's hearts in society, and contributed greatly to the success of the Northern Expedition. When the Central Bank was first established in the 17th year, due to the lack of credit of the Central Bank, the tide of bank runs swept the country, and they also supported the Central Bank to overcome the difficulties. As for the repeated abolishment of the tael and the reform of the yuan, the reform of the legal currency, the issuance of bonds, and the management of foreign exchange, to be fair, if there were no help from the two banks, I am afraid it would not have been as smooth as ideal. Furthermore, the unified issuance in the early days of the War of Resistance was also due to the clear understanding of the great righteousness of the two banks, which indeed increased the strength of the War of Resistance. It is not that we are deliberately defending, but those who discuss great things should have some fairness.</p>
<p>In recent years, the so-called crimes of wealthy families have already been portrayed by everyone, but it is precisely because of this that almost everyone can put the hat of wealthy families on those they hate. Here, what we want to discuss is whether all the directors and supervisors of the national banks and bureaus are wealthy families? According to the law, the directors and supervisors of the Central and Communications Banks have always been appointed by the government for state-owned shares, and commercial shares must also be approved by the government before they can be produced. If these directors and supervisors have indeed become wealthy families because of the Central and Communications Banks, then their guilt should lie in the improper administrative measures in the past. Moreover, not all directors and supervisors are necessarily wealthy families. In addition, from an objective point of view, after the War of Resistance, the cancellation of the agency rights of the Central and Communications Banks, the transfer of deposits and foreign exchange of military and political organs, and all privileges have long been lost. In addition, the deposit and loan interest rates and the use of head positions are all subject to strict control by the financial authorities, while the Ministry of Finance takes what it wants, and the Central Bank issues banknotes without restrictions. The result of harming the country and the people lies here and not there. Furthermore, the establishment of the Central and Communications Banks did not begin today, and the so-called emergence of wealthy families is a matter of recent years. Why did the two banks not produce wealthy families in the past, but now they have suddenly deteriorated? Moreover, before the 17th year of the Republic of China, the proportion of capital of the Central and Communications Banks was two official shares and eight commercial shares. At that time, most of the strength was in the hands of the commercial shareholders, but there were no wealthy families. Now that most of the strength is in the hands of the government, is it a miracle that wealthy families have emerged? Therefore, if we deduce from the logic of Wang and others' proposal, then if we really want to overthrow wealthy families today, all the state-owned shares of other state banks, except for the Central Bank, should withdraw to avoid the involvement of wealthy families and eliminate the crime of disrupting finance, and thus become true national capital.</p>
<p>To go a step further, as shareholders of the Central and Communications Banks, they have not only not benefited from the banks in the past few years, but also suffered considerable losses in their due interests due to the frequent wars and the government's repeated exploitation of the rights and interests of the two banks. For example, the composition of state-owned and commercial shares of the Central and Communications Banks was originally two official shares and eight commercial shares in the early years of the Republic of China. In the 24th year, the Bank of China was changed to half state-owned and half commercial, and the Bank of Communications was changed to six official shares and four commercial shares. When the two banks increased their capital in the 31st year, due to the War of Resistance, the commercial shareholders were scattered in various places and could not handle it at the same time. As a result, only the state-owned shares increased. As a result, the state-owned shares of the Bank of China increased to more than 60%, and the commercial shares decreased to 33%; the state-owned shares of the Bank of Communications increased to 86%, and the commercial shares decreased to 13%. Furthermore, the capital of each increase in state-owned shares did not actually pay cash, but only used some public debt and other head positions to offset it, which is by no means comparable to the silver dollars paid by the commercial shares in those years. What is the true value of public debt now? God knows... During the currency reform of August 19th in the tenth year, the foreign exchange head positions of the two banks were all deposited in the Central Bank, and the contributions of handling military and political free remittances and low-interest national policy loans for the government over the years can also be said to be the infinite exploitation of the original commercial shares. Based on these many factors, the income of state banks has become relatively reduced. We have seen that the dividends paid by the Central and Communications Banks in recent years are far less than the profits of other investments, which can prove that this situation is true. The reason why commercial shareholders have endured the losses of investment for so many years is nothing more than hoping that the Central and Communications Banks can have a day of revival after peace. Now there is a strange argument that disregards the previous assets of the bank and酌give a price, forcibly ordering the commercial shares to take back the capital, which will not only sweep away the credit of the government? Such long-term agitation will inevitably make the people regard all businesses that cooperate with the government as a fear, what benefit is there to the government?</p>
<p>In fact, state capital and wealthy family capital are inherently different. State capital is a kind of capital controlled by the government, and the government can be responsible for deciding all the policies of its investment business. On the contrary, wealthy family capital is a private product, and all interests depend on their own manipulation. Today, although there are commercial shares in the name of the Central and Communications Banks, because the directors and supervisors are appointed by the government, the actual power is still controlled by the government. If you want to improve the personnel of the Central and Communications Banks, you can do it with just one order. Why bother to reorganize and merge? Moreover, the Central and Communications Banks have good credit in the past and have branches abroad, which will undoubtedly be more convenient for absorbing overseas Chinese remittances and handling industrial and commercial import and export guarantees. If they are reorganized into purely state-owned banks, according to international practice, their foreign branches will hardly be able to stand, which is not what wise people should take. Furthermore, regarding the system of the bank itself, the world trend has all tended towards specialization. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France need not be mentioned, but even the socialist Soviet Union can never be an exception? Therefore, the proposal of Wang and others to turn the specialized national banks and treasuries back into general-purpose banks is theoretically inconsistent with the current trend.</p>
<p>In short, in this turbulent period, except for illegal and unreasonable institutions, it is absolutely not appropriate to make many changes, especially changes that disregard objectivity and rely solely on subjectivity. Changes become the source of chaos, and the more they change, the more chaotic they become. Isn't the financial world the same? Judging from the current financial situation in our country, we should seek to establish national credit, give full play to the effectiveness of existing institutions, abolish all rigid control laws that easily cause capital to escape, thereby win the hearts of the people, absorb overseas Chinese capital, and increase national wealth. On the contrary, if we abandon the fundamentals and pursue the trivial, we may not be able to achieve much effect. With the current emptiness of the national treasury, the financial deficit, and the insufficiency of political expenses and all expenses, where can there be the remaining power to acquire the commercial shares of various national banks? If we use increased issuance as the capital for acquisition, will it not deepen the suffering of the people? Therefore, we believe that the current measures to roughly change or merge the national banks and treasuries are of no benefit to reality. The only way for the government to do now is to quickly use the history and reputation of the Central and Communications Banks to create a brand new page in financial history, which is the smooth path to stabilizing finance.</p>

<h3>Lu Han reports on the bandit situation in Yunnan, believing that it can be cleared within three months.</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Kunming, 16th] Amidst the rumors of the expansion of banditry in Yunnan, the provincial security authorities held a tea party for the press at noon on the 16th, presided over by Chairman Lu Han himself. Lu said: The banditry in Yunnan is not as rampant as rumored. The main reason for the riots in various places is actually the turbulent political situation and the uneasiness of the people. Speculators incited the riots from the middle, and the weapons possessed by the local bullies in various counties are far superior to the local teams. Therefore, they often use their superior conditions to make things difficult for the local leaders. Over time, their power expands, making it even more difficult to suppress the bandits. They echoed each other and colluded with each other, making it difficult to encircle and suppress them. In fact, the main force of the scattered bandits does not exceed the strength of a battalion of the national army. Heavy troops have been dispatched to the south and west to increase defense. The 26th Army is also cooperating in the suppression. After the security teams are transferred back for reorganization and training, they can reinforce various places. The scattered bandits who fled are not worth mentioning. Lu told the reporters in a firm tone that he believed that the banditry in Yunnan could be cleared within three months.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Dublin, 18th Dispatch] Twenty-one gun salutes from O'Connell Bridge in Dublin at midnight yesterday, the simultaneous ringing of church bells, and the cheers of millions of people across the country marked the birth of the independent Republic of Ireland. Dozens of powerful searchlights in Dublin cast white beams of light that wove intricate patterns in the sky. Most of the Irish people stayed awake last night to celebrate Ireland's departure from the British Commonwealth. The Irish in London also joined in the celebrations of their compatriots at midnight. Starting at midnight, Irish President O'Kelly began to assume all the powers over Ireland previously held by King George VI of England. From that time on, Irish people in Britain and those serving in the British armed forces technically became "foreigners," although according to prior understandings, this issue will be determined at a later date. This morning, the Irish tricolor was raised high above the government buildings and at the site of the 1916 uprising by two thousand Irish Republican volunteers. Four bronze plaques hung in front of the Post Office, representing the four provinces of Ireland, including the "lost" province of Ulster in Northern Ireland. After reviewing the troops this morning, President O'Kelly hosted the diplomatic corps at his official residence in Phoenix Park in the afternoon, and held a grand ball at Dublin Castle in the evening. New York, a city with a strong Irish identity, also celebrated the independence of the Republic of Ireland across the Atlantic. New York Mayor O'Dwyer, of Irish descent, gave a speech urging the British to withdraw from Northern Ireland to complete the unification of Ireland. Britain has accepted Ireland's complete departure from the British Commonwealth with magnanimity. The British High Commissioner's Office in Dublin was closed at midnight and replaced by an embassy. However, no celebrations were permitted in Northern Ireland, and the authorities were on high alert to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 17th Dispatch] On the eve of the birth of the Republic of Ireland, Indian Prime Minister Nehru sent a congratulatory telegram to Irish Prime Minister Costello. Indian High Commissioner to Britain, Menon, will also serve as minister to Ireland, but Menon will remain in London.</p>
<h3>Iran-Soviet Relations Increasingly Tense; Soviet Union Closes Consulate in Azerbaijan Province; Iranian Ambassador to the US Explains Soviet-Iranian Treaty</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 17th Broadcast: Deriran News: Soviet Consul General in Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan Province, Krakhnik, has closed his consulate and led all staff back to the Soviet Union. At the same time, Soviet consulate staff in Makou, Astara, and Rezaiyeh in Azerbaijan Province have also returned to the Soviet Union with Krakhnik.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th Dispatch] A spokesman for the Iranian Embassy here said that if the Soviet Union has any dissatisfaction with Iran or the presence of a US military mission in Iran, it should appeal to the United Nations under the UN Charter. The Iranian government believes that Article VI of the 1921 Soviet-Iranian Treaty, which allows Soviet troops to enter Iran under certain circumstances, has been superseded by the UN Charter's provisions for dealing with threats to peace and security. Article VI of the 1921 Soviet-Iranian Treaty stipulated that if a third party intended to use Iranian territory as a base for operations against the Soviet Union, threatening the Soviet border, and the Iranian government, after being urged by the Soviet Union to pay attention and take action, was still unable to prevent such a threat to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union had the right to send troops into Iran. Since the creation of the UN Charter, a UN organization has been in place to deal with all threats to peace and security, and the provisions of Article VI are no longer applicable. The statement by the Iranian Embassy was made after reports that the Soviet and Iranian governments had exchanged notes several times regarding the presence of a US military mission in Iran and Iran's opposition to frequent Soviet pressure on Iran. However, the Iranian Embassy spokesman also stated that the Iranian Embassy had not received any reports on the exchange of notes between the Soviet Union and Iran, and that the spokesman's remarks were only a general clarification of the Iranian government's position on the issue.</p>

<h3>Disagreement Among Three Powers on West German Constitution Issue is Inaccurate</h3>

<h3>Trial Run of Direct Beijing-Guangzhou Train Commences; First Train Passes Through South Shanghai; Fare Increases and Currency Shortage Affect Ridership</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After several setbacks and numerous false starts, the direct Beijing-Guangzhou train service, with the determination of the Ministry of Transportation, finally commenced its trial run yesterday. The train departed Nanjing at 10:00 AM and arrived at the North Station in this city on time at 4:45 PM. Before departure, Minister of Transportation Duanmu Jie personally presided over the departure ceremony. Deputy Director Li of the Ministry of Transportation's Intermodal Transportation Department, Section Chief Kang, Deputy Director Shen Entao of the two railway bureaus, and Deputy Director Liu Shizhong of the Transportation Department arrived in Shanghai with the train. The train stopped in Shanghai for three hours and thirty minutes and continued its journey at 8:15 PM. Because the national railway adjusted fares yesterday, the originally set fares could not be applied. The Ministry of Transportation temporarily changed them. A sleeper ticket from Beijing to Guangzhou costs a whopping 7.4 million (currency), and a sleeper ticket from Shanghai to Guangzhou also requires 6.654 million (currency). Moreover, yesterday was also Sunday, and cash was required to purchase tickets, so some registered passengers had to abandon their plans to travel south because they could not gather so much cash on short notice. Ridership was extremely poor yesterday. Half of the third-class tickets were sold, about 30-40% of the second-class tickets, and very few first-class tickets. However, tickets presold the day before were not subject to additional charges. The new fares are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai to Jinhua: First Class 666,000 (currency), Second Class 444,000 (currency). Quzhou: First Class 701,000 (currency), Second Class 534,000 (currency), Third Class 267,000 (currency). Shangrao: First Class 1,002,000 (currency), Second Class 668,000 (currency), Third Class 334,000 (currency). Nanchang: First Class 1,322,000 (currency), Second Class 948,000 (currency), Third Class 474,000 (currency). Zhangshu: First Class 1,572,000 (currency), Second Class 1,048,000 (currency), Third Class 524,000 (currency). Pingxiang: First Class 1,926,000 (currency), Second Class 1,288,000 (currency), Third Class 642,000 (currency).

Liling: First Class 1,977,000 (currency), Second Class 1,318,000 (currency), Third Class 659,000 (currency). Hengyang: First Class 2,343,000 (currency), Second Class 1,562,000 (currency), Third Class 781,000 (currency).

<h3>Rising Winds Blow Through Vegetable Markets: Pork and Beef at 60,000 per Jin, Seasonal Goods Priced in Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday's rain saw the rising winds blow through the small vegetable markets again. All kinds of meat and vegetable dishes saw crazy price increases, generally doubling or tripling within a day or two. Pork and beef have already been raised to 60,000 yuan per jin. Seasonal goods, such as large prawns, are even being priced in Yuan Shikai silver dollars, valued at 3 jiao per pair. The price is converted to Gold Yuan Certificates based on the market price of Yuan Shikai silver dollars at the time of purchase, which was 54,000 yuan per pair yesterday morning. Furthermore, numerous "silver bulls" (speculators) have recently infiltrated the vegetable markets early in the morning, holding cash to buy Yuan Shikai silver dollars from housewives' savings. Therefore, the market price of Yuan Shikai silver dollars in the vegetable markets can be readily ascertained with a simple inquiry. Only the seasonal small yellow croaker fish remains relatively stable in price, ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 yuan per jin. Fish like bluefish and mandarin fish are priced at over 1,000 yuan per liang, making them luxury items for wealthy families. Chicken and duck eggs are priced in several tiers, ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 yuan per egg depending on size. The price increases for vegetables are even more severe, with even the most basic small pond vegetables costing 2,000 yuan per jin, bamboo shoots at 6,000 yuan, hairy bamboo shoots at 4,000 yuan, and mung bean sprouts, sprouted beans, and pickled vegetables costing around 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per jin.</p>
<p>Moreover, yesterday was Foreign Qingming (All Souls' Day), and upper-class Christian families traditionally enjoy gifting Qingming eggs made of chocolate, the prices of which are even more astonishing. An ordinary egg-sized one costs 50,000 yuan, while slightly larger ones are priced as high as 300,000 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Index-Based Wage System No Longer Viable: Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Demands Change of Method</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The alarming rate of devaluation of the Gold Yuan Certificate and the rampant rise in prices have made the cost of living index released by the municipal government mid-month an irony of the times. The city's more than one million wage earners who are paid according to the index can no longer bear the double burden of low wages and high prices. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has been secretly discussing this situation repeatedly in recent days. It is learned that the representatives of the Federation of Trade Unions raised the issue at the Municipal Government's Cost of Living Index Compilation Review Committee on the 15th of this month, requesting the establishment of a small committee to study future wage calculation standards. The current "average index" wage system can no longer be used, otherwise, it will lead to serious consequences. They also limited the small committee to convene a meeting within five days (before the 20th) to draft a concrete plan for future salary standards and submit it to the Municipal Affairs Conference for approval and implementation before the 30th of this month. At that time, the capital and government representatives on the Compilation and Review Committee believed that the authority of the Compilation and Review Committee was limited to the review of the compilation of the cost of living index and had no right to discuss this proposal. It was decided to authorize the Chief Statistician, Chu Yifei, to submit a request to the Acting Mayor of the Municipal Government to change the wage system. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions told our reporter: The city's industrial circles absolutely trust the scientific nature and accuracy of the index for the first half of this month, and the response of various industry trade unions to the index is also very good. However, this average index wage system can no longer be maintained. For example, on the 15th of this month, the price of rice in the city was 750,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). A worker with a base salary of 50 yuan, whose salary is calculated according to an index of 15,140 times, would only receive 757,000 yuan, which is only enough to buy one shi of rice. When the currency reform was carried out on August 19 last year, 50 Gold Yuan could buy at least 2.5 shi of rice. The average index wage system has been eliminated by the times, as can be seen from this. He also said that the proposal of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions may not be discussed within five days, but he believes that a solution will be found before the end of this month.</p>

<h3>Sheshan Commands the Nine Peaks: An Excellent Place for Spring Outings, Most Beautiful at Dusk with Dark Skies, Low Clouds, and a Gentle Evening Breeze</h3>
<p>[Our Special Report] Sheshan, a spring outing destination only one and a half hours away from Shanghai, is probably not unfamiliar to most citizens. In the depths of April, the foot of the mountain is often filled with various cars from the city, and many people spend their weekends and holidays here.</p>
<p>From the perspective of appreciating scenery, Sheshan's ability to become a spring outing resort is not entirely due to having a church and an observatory that is famous in three provinces, but rather because it is the leader of the peaks, towering over the many surrounding mountains such as Chenshan, Luoshan, Xueshan, Tianmashan, Xiaojishan, and Fenghuangshan, dominating the center of the so-called "Nine Peaks" in the eastern area of ​​Taihu Lake. From the mountain ridge, looking into the distance, the peaks are connected in the misty clouds, quietly nestled against a large plain in Jiangnan. Occasionally, a canal is seen in the distance like a belt, reflecting three or five farmhouses, next to which are rapeseed flowers like brocade. This scenery is indeed enough to make people linger.</p>
<p>Evaluating the Nine Peaks of Sheshan: Evaluating the mountain scenery along the coast, the Nine Peaks of Sheshan are slightly inferior to the magnificence of Nanjing's mountains, slightly less elegant than the beauty of Wukang Mogan, the peaks of Lingyan and Tianping in Suzhou have a little more embellishment, the overall environment of Xiangshan in Beiping is more secluded and elegant, and like the mountainous areas of Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan, which have roads leading directly to the peaks, it seems to lack a bit of modern appearance. But this is already enough to please the urban children who are buried in trivial matters. Leaving in the morning and returning in the evening, half a day of fleeting life, a few hours of lingering, can at least dilute the dust of profit and desire.</p>
<p>The most beautiful realm of Sheshan is at dusk, with dark skies, low clouds, and a gentle evening breeze blowing through the thickets. A touch of red glow in the west reflects the silent wilderness. At this time, a priest occasionally walks by, his slender figure wrapped in a black robe, carrying a book, quietly climbing the mountain in the evening prayer bells. Those who have seen Wang Wei's "Riding through Jianmen in Fine Rain" will surely be able to appreciate this poetry.</p>
<p>Without a Hint of Vulgarity: Perhaps it is the good fortune of the lakes and mountains, but until now, the Sheshan Nine Peaks area has not been favored by vulgar merchants like the West Lake. It is indeed gratifying that there is no strong commercial atmosphere in the scenic area. Not to mention advertising signs and cafes, there is not even a decent cold drink stall at the foot of Sheshan. When the climbers are thirsty, the village women leading the oxen come up to sell water chestnuts, which is of course an irony for the urban children who come to enjoy the spring with a lot of Gold Yuan. It is precisely because of this that foreign tourists always account for more of the visitors to Sheshan in the spring and autumn seasons. Their way of traveling is exceptionally cheerful. As soon as they get off the car, they take off their shirts and climb the hillside without stone steps in groups. When they reach the top of the peak, they raise their hands towards the sky, and even the oldest people feel that they have become younger.</p>
<p>Several mountains in the Sheshan Nine Peaks are known for their production of stone. The annual construction projects of the Jiangnan seawall, the past renovation of Longhua Airport, and the cobblestone pavements of various roads in the city are all made of stone quarried from these mountains. There are two highways to Sheshan in Shanghai, Qinghu Road and Songhu Road. The road surface of the former is more ideal than the latter and is praised as a high-quality county road in Jiangsu Province. Its regular road maintenance work relies on the Sheshan stones, using local materials, so it can maintain the integrity of the road surface.</p>
<p>The Church on the Top of the Mountain Has Experienced the Vicissitudes of Life</p>
<p>The Catholic Church standing on Sheshan can also be said to be a building that has experienced the vicissitudes of life. At the top of the church is a bronze statue of Jesus, thousands of feet above the Pujiang River, looking down with his head bowed on the cross. For decades, he has seen the Northern Expeditionary Army marching through the foothills to capture Shanghai, and he has also seen Japanese soldiers shelling the national army positions on the opposite mountain. Now he has seen many local teams training at the foot of the mountain. The lakes and mountains remain the same, and the leisurely white clouds seem to always be testifying to the record of time, but the vicissitudes of life and the sadness of our generation are probably enough for Jesus to see!</p>

<h3>Fuel Imports Arrive in Endless Stream: Over 18,000 Tons of Coal Shipped to Shanghai One After Another, Flour-for-Coal Barter Exempted from Taxation by Communist Side</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Although the source of fuel in the city has not been seen to be strong, imports are arriving in an endless stream. The Tangshan Wheel of the China Shipping Company arrived in Shanghai last Saturday from Qinhuangdao, carrying 6,800 tons of coal and 432 pieces of mail, and berthed at the Kaiping Wharf for unloading. The Dasheng Wheel of the Continental Company, carrying 3,800 tons of coal for the power company from Qinhuangdao, and the Fushen Wheel of the Fushen Company, carrying 2,700 tons of coal from Keelung, are both scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. The Russian ship Smolenay, carrying over 5,000 tons of coal from Vladivostok, was expected to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but it had not been seen to arrive by the evening. It is expected to arrive in port this morning, and it is scheduled to berth at Pier No. 1 of the Four Mines Joint Office (formerly the Mitsui Warehouse). In addition, the Panama Wheel Punis, managed by Texaco, carrying over 14,870 tons of diesel from the Persian Gulf, which was also purchased by the power company, was scheduled to arrive in port yesterday. Due to the bad weather, it did not arrive yesterday, and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning. Previously, it was rumored that the Communist Party would levy import taxes on flour-for-coal barter. After the Wheel Association's best efforts to negotiate for exemption, it is said that after several discussions, the Communist Party has understood, and the number of transport ships has also increased from eight to fifteen. The above issues will be implemented as soon as the official document arrives. Nanqiang, Yongxing, and other ships are waiting for the solution before loading flour and continuing to sail to Qinhuangdao for coal barter. According to news from the shipping industry, in the future, in addition to flour-for-coal barter, it is also planned to use timber-for-coal barter, and negotiations are currently underway.</p>

<h3>Mayor's Cup: Fight to the Death, Double Overtime, Kang Team Edges Bell, Yu Win over Jingle 47-35, Women's Team Li Beats Force Team by Five Goals</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the Mayor's Cup basketball game, the women's team Li defeated the Force team last night, 24-14.

<p>·Team Li Wins over Team Force·</p>
<p>The women's team match between team Li and team Force was the first match last night. Li team's Cai Mingxia and the Qian sisters scored five points in a row, and Yao Silian was also very brilliant. In the first quarter, the Force team 'laid an egg,' which can be said to be the main reason for the Force team's failure last night. In the second quarter, Li team's Chen Yuqin replaced Yao, and Zhu Chui Di replaced You Ping. Force team's Weng Xiayun and Fan Yuying scored three points with one free throw and one throw, returning the egg that was laid earlier, because the Li team also did not score in this quarter, and the audience burst into laughter. In the third quarter, Li team became fierce again. Force team's repeated changes did not work, resulting in 14-5.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, after Force team's Yao Wenda replaced Liang Miaozhen, they scored several goals in a row, causing the Li team to have a 'puzzled' expression. This time, the men's rules were adopted, and there was no sufficient publicity and preparation beforehand, so many teams could not 'cope with ease.' Several young players said themselves 'can't handle it.' In the end, team Li won by 24-14.</p>
