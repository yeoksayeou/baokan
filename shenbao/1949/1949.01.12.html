<h3>監察院會通過宣言　呼籲立卽停戰謀和　推居正等策劃具體步驟</h3>
<p>〔本報雨京十一日電〕監察院全體委員於十一日晨第卅四次院會中，討論通過呼籲和平宣言，其中除說明戰爭所加於人民之痛苦，呼籲為國家，為人民，更為後代子孫着想，立卽停戰謀和外，並稱，眞正的勝利，應着想如何得民心，如何實現全國人民所一致盼望之和平，希望共黨領袖以人民為重，和平如能實現，則大家應卸却自身的權利與地位，以謝國人，卽監委亦願及時退讓賢能。十一日晨院會中討論時，各委員均力持客觀態度，以求文字上對國共雙方均無輕重之嫌。十一日院會由于院長親自主持，於熱烈詳盡之討論後，愼重通過。旋續討論唐鴻烈等臨時提案一件，提出該院對促進和談之具體行動數項意見，經討論後，認為已有和平宣言，在先所擬辦法，推定委員先加研究後，再予決定，其意見如次：（一）電請總統，孫院長及毛澤東卽日停止軍事行動，并從速指派專員，負責策劃和平商談之具體步驟及代表和談，迅作有效有力之進行。（二）由院以在京全體監委名義，邀請張治中，張羣，邵力子，吳忠信等商討有關和平問題。（三）推派代表三至五人，分訪美·英·法·蘇四國駐華大使，純以民意代表身份，說明和平願望，請轉達各該國政府，並就近從事斡旋。（四）推定委員五至七人，搜集有關資料及研究有關和平諸問題，以便隨時提供有關方面採擇，並經常與指派和談專負保持接觸，以期有所促進與折衝，該會推定研究之委員，為居正，王向辰，金越光，孫玉琳，唐鴻烈，劉平江，張萬眞，任秉鈞，祁大鵬，陳瑀山，並由居正召集。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕立法院留京委員座談時局，十日下午開會後，頃又定十四日下午三時繼續舉行。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十一日電〕立法委員多人，正討論草擬一項可為雙方接受的和平計劃，以推動目前的和平運動。</p>
<h3>監委宣方全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕監察院全體監委十一日集會，修正通過呼籲和平宣言，全文如次：　全國國民一致期待的和平，自將總統本年元旦文告發表後，業已露出曙光，然而事勢演變到今天，仍在和戰不決的階段徘徊，令人萬分懸念，我監察委員同人，受國民之付託，在此緊要關頭，自不能不將利害得失與爭取和平的要義，坦白誠懇，正告於國人之前。</p>
<p>八年抗日戰爭，國家元氣損傷已極，勝利後，又復兵連禍結，尸橫遍野，而輾轉溝壑者，更不可以數計，此種生命犧牲的慘雷，實為我中華民族無可補償的損失，同時，在經濟方面，則田園荒蕪，農村破產，交通斷絕，工商萎縮，一切生產力量，均陷停　崩潰之境，長此以往，直將使中華民族及其後代子孫的生活憑藉，根本毀減，這種戰爭的惡果，我們都是親身經歷，思之痛心，全國人民，實在不能再行忍受，也無法繼續忍受，因此，我們要迫切呼籲，請為國家，為人民，更為後代的子孫着想，立卽放棄戰爭，就地停戰，謀取和平。</p>
<p>國父中山先生手創之三民主義，實為我國家之立國原則，此早為全國國民公認，并為政協時代　黨派予以共同承認者，惟是主我之實行，必須以和平為基礎，絕非循戰爭途徑所得解決，何况戰爭是禍患的根苗，不僅不能解決國家社會的各種問題，反使各種問題增加其嚴重性，試看今日政府各項措施，處處棘手，民生疾苦，日益加深，而共黨佔據區內，亦復民窮力盡，十室九空，都不能解決人民的問題，且軍事的勝利縱然可以奪得一城一地，而戰亂的惡果，却徒增人民的痛苦，喪失廣大的民心，所以眞正的勝利，應當着想如何得民心，如何實現全國人民所一致殷切盼望的和平，憑藉武力，是不能達到目的的。</p>
<p>蔣總統的文告裏，明白表示一切以國是為前提，不計個人的進退，這種坦白的態度，實在令人欽佩，但是和平的實現，絕不能將其全部責任歸之於某一方或是某一人，因此，我們希望政府中的首長們，必須一致效法蔣總統謙冲為國的精神，故棄成見，努力和平，同時，我們也要求共黨的領袖們，應有同樣的襟懷，以人民為重，停戰言和，一旦和平實現，我們更主張大家都卸却已身的權利與地位，以謝國人。</p>
<p>我監察委員同人，恭司風憲，深愧才德菲薄，無補時艱，倘和平能早期實現，亦亟願隨諸公之後，退認賢能。</p>
<p>廿世紀是人民的世紀，人民才是國家的主人，國家的政事，應該由人民來決定，我們人民再不應忍受少數人的壓迫，做他們的奴隸，更不應受好戰人們的驅使，跟他們僅砲灰，政府旣已為民請命，表示停戰言和，共黨如以民生為重，已無理由再事戰爭，我們要求生活，不容許有貪官貪吏的剝奪，我們要求自由與生存，不容許再有恐怖的威脅與殘酷的戰爭，在這和平呼聲充滿宇內的時候，我們一方面要呼籲和平，一方面我們要加强團結。充實自身的力量，來爭取和平，保陣和平。</p>

<h3>空軍掩護上主動突圍杜部抵有利地區　苦守青龍集月餘實已達成任務</h3>
<p>〔本報滁縣十一日電〕杜聿明部已正式向靑龍集西北地區突園，該部邱·李兩兵團暨孫兵團一部合約十二個軍，自去年十二月三日主動撤離徐州後，沿途排除共匪抵抗，至六日，國軍進至永城東靑龍集·睢溪口及趙家集中間地區，復遭優勢之匪屢屢包圍，激戰至一月五日，陳劉諸匪部節節增援，其番號經發現者達十二個縱隊，合約卅餘萬人，除於該地區四週挖掘深寬各數丈之壕塹五道，藉阻國軍機械化部隊活動外，並集中各式砲數千門，向直徑不足十五公里之國軍陣地密集轟擎，且於每次轟擊後，並繼以人海戰術，向國軍肉搏衝鋒，故戰事之烈，洵為戡亂軍興以來所未有。守軍雖有空運接濟，終以地凍天寒，援軍路遙，衆寡懸殊，彈糧不濟諸因素，乃不得不於空軍掩護下主動向永城以北靑龍集西北地區正式突圍，至發電時，國軍已轉至某有利地區。按杜部苦守靑龍集附近地區凡月餘，斃傷匪軍計達念餘萬，軍方一大認為已完滿達成任務，並獲最大代價與最高戰果。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕杜聿明率部於激戰五日後，在十日黎明前分三股，以三個方向脫離陳官莊戰塲攻擊前進。據悉：邱淸泉所部精銳輕裝部隊皆在其中，而李彌所部則大多於五日激戰中犧牲殆盡，此部突圍部隊，今後數日行動，較黃維兵團南行突圍之歷程將更為艱苦，蓋官兵心志雖屬堅忍，而體力則因自十一月廿九日自徐州南下所經四十四天野戰生活而顯疲憊。據悉，以車輪戰法見長之匪劉伯承所部二個縱隊，已由津浦鐵路固鎭據點西移北上，在蒙城一帶預佈狙擊棧，故杜聿明部目下雖有數萬攻擊行進，能否安全到達預定地點，殊難逆料。今日空軍各型戰鬥機在杜聿明部途程上空掩護其行動，不斷攻擎阻撓杜部之匪軍，英再之三大隊第十七中隊隊長座機且被匪擊壞，跳傘未張，墜地犧牲</p>
<p>〔本報滁縣十一日電〕杜聿明部雖已突圍，但宿蚌前綫滄，澥諸河閒十日。十一日依然平靜無大戰，津浦南段張八嶺北小王營附近，十日夜竄到土共三百餘，破壞路軌四，枕木廿餘，經國軍護路部隊兜擊後，十一日拂曉前匪乃西竄，十一日晨八時卽由搶修隊修復通車。</p>
<p>〔本報明光十一日電〕津浦南段兩旁散匪經交警配合國軍進勦肅淸，列車行駛安全。</p>
<h3>民治黨電毛澤東　呼籲速停戰言和</h3>

<h3>國際調處事無新發展　我政府靜待答覆　四強使節亦候本國指示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕關於國際調處我國內爭，以促成和平一節，十一日無新發展，我政府正待蘇·美·英·法四國對吳兼外長八日所提出之備忘錄之答覆。四國使節方面，亦在靜候其本國政府之指示。外交界人士對此事均持極端緘默態度，不作任何評論或推測。　〔合衆社南京十一日電〕據可靠方面十一日確認，四强中尙無一答覆中國籲請調停的要求，有資格之觀察家預料，美·英·法之答覆對政府將屬有利，但蘇聯則大有問題，據指出，如無蘇聯的協助，與共產黨的接觸幾乎絕不可能，至於中國是否請求美·英。法三國運用渠等之外交影響，敦促蘇聯參加斡旋，則尙無所知。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十一日電〕倫敦泰晤士報外交訪員訊，中國政府呼籲英·美·法·蘇四强調解國共間之糾紛，以便促成和平一事，現已受到各國同情之考慮。惟此間外交界對此項呼籲之直接反響，認為除非現似屬不可能參加之蘇聯參加調解，則外國調解亦似無勸誘在軍事上佔勝利之中共與國民政府舉行談判之可能。此間外交界由於想及過去馬歇爾之經騐，對於外國調解員是否有資格覓取一項能作為雙方談判之基礎，殊為懷疑。</p>

<h3>當前的物價</h3>
<p>在兌金政策一誤再誤下，上海物價均飛漲至空前高峯，尤其米紗油煤價格上漲的猛烈，沉重的抑壓住每一個人。財政主管和央行當局，為撲滅此項漲風，十一日採取了緊急的措施，一面將黃金平衡費掛低五百元，一面復拋出大量物資，因之昨天的物價，略轉回跌至一成至二三成不等。這祗是物價瘋狂漲風中的一種頓挫，并非自然的下跌，未來情勢仍是可憂的。</p>
<p>上海物價的上漲，已經不是驚人的新聞了，它已成為社會經濟必然的現象。不過每次物價的上漲，除了戰爭與通貨膨脹兩項主要導因以外，其他因素并不相同，也不全同，而這些因素又往往招致漲勢最為瘋狂。近日物價迭創高峯，以民生日用品的漲風最猛烈，而非各類物品的普遍上漲，自然其他各類物品亦互受上漲的影響而升騰了。根據本月十一日上期生活指數第三次調查，距第二次調查時，物價又已升起三四成，與前兩次調查時相扯結果，當為上期指數之一倍，如米已漲百分之一百二十，油已漲百分之一百三十，紗已漲百分之一百，煤已漲百分之二百，水電已漲至倍半，僅房租與其他物品之漲勢，尙在一倍以下。這說明上海此次物價漲風，獲得利得的祗是少數人，而多數警良苦難的人，仍煎受沉重的生活高壓，過着饑饉。恐怖。混亂的日子。</p>
<p>此次物價飛漲的因素，歸納言之，大約有四個：第一，是當局處理兌金政策的錯誤，尤其在黃金加收平衡費後，刺激了物價的上漲。黃金加收平衡費，幾乎同黑市看齊，而投機者仍不斷吞進，於是新的黑市又出現，這對於物價的刺激極其重大；第二，是通貨膨脹與財政赤字閒循環式的擴大，無情的刺激了物價。政府現在唯一的財政武器，是發行通貨，要之通貨膨脹則物價高漲，物價高漲則財政赤字愈益龐大，財政赤字愈益龐大則需發行通貨之數字愈大，如此循循不已，當直接促使物價上漲的幅度加闊，使物價上漲的趨勢益不可收拾，這是年來物價飛漲的根本原因，最近這種趨勢更加猛烈；第三，因團貨之普遍，刺激了物價。當人民在經騐中體味到金圓券購買力不斷的降低，就產生了「重物輕幣」的心理，於是一有現鈔在手就立刻用以購買貨物，其中大部固是米煤油紗等生活必需品，但藉此以保存自已財產價値也不少，結果遂使市塲物資愈益缺少，同時一有鈔在手立刻用以購買物資的習慣，復使金圓券流通速度大大增加了，目前物價一日數漲而不跌，即是金圓券流通速度太大太速之故；第四，是戰局政局的動盪不安，內地若干米煤來源發生匱乏之象，這都是加深物價變亂汎濫的原因。</p>
<p>基於上述四項因素造成的物價飛漲現象，其發展的趨勢，當是十分嚴重的事。撲滅此種惡性的漲風，或者說根絕此項漲風，唯一是實現國內的和平，事實上也唯有和平纔能拯救人間的災難，這是澄淸目前社會經濟問題的根本途徑。消極的捨本的辦法，像央行目前所採取的措施，如黃金平衡費掛低，或大量抽緊銀根，或有計劃的拋出物資，都可能壓迫物價回疲，但不可能完全下跌，它祗是表現物價暫時的伸縮罷了。因此，我們對於目前大漲小回中的物價前途，並不表示樂觀。</p>
<h3>行政院正積極籌劃　六都市儲三月糧　京滬所儲存尙不到半數</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕據糧新社訊：政院正積極籌劃京。滬·平·津·靑島·廣州·六大都市儲糧三月計劃，平津因運輸困難，難望實現，其他四都市，將由糧食緊急儲購會及當地市府各負祖預定數額之半數，購儲所需款項將由央行貸付，據可靠方面消息：上海儲糧三月共需一百七十餘萬担，南京共需三十六萬六千担，截至目前止，南京已儲存一十四萬担，上海已儲存四十一萬四千祖，離預定目標尙不到半數責任誰屬尙待查明</p>

<h3>如組織美空軍志願隊　陳納德願意領導　認中國目前戰爭內戰</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本埠訊〕抗戰時著名之「飛虎隊」領袖陳納德將軍，今日重行申明願意領導美國志願隊為中國政府作戰，並表示此舉仍可有效，惟該隊須有適當之組織及供應，並與中國空軍協同動作。組織新志願隊之議，早於數星期前提出，美國第十四航空隊舊部若干，自願重來中國，並建議由陳氏領導。此事雖曾引起贊成與反對，惟華盛頓官方迄無表示。據陳氏與記者談話稱，蔣總統未請渠組織新志願隊。渠雖曾以第十四航空隊舊部志願投效事通知總統，迄未得覆。渠認為中國現在之戰爭，並非內戰，乃共產主義反對一切非共產之戰。凡反對共產主義之中國人，多數將歡迎美國新志願隊；其傾向共產主義者則將加以反對，惟渠知多數中國人皆為反對共產主義者。一部份觀察家批評中國空軍並不作戰，或並不熱心作戰，此言渠不以為然；中國空軍曾受與敵空軍交戰之訓練，而未受援助地面工作或攻擊地而目標之訓練，但其成績亦頗良好。陳氏不願預言共軍　佔領全中國民航空運隊之命運將如何，但稱，渠不希望在共產黨控制下之中國繼續活動。</p>

<h3>當局拋售物資抽緊銀根　物價昨普遍回挫　國行通知各行局緊縮匯款業務</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市昨日起銀根轉緊，拆息上升，日拆最高做每十元一百元，普通亦達每十元七十元之譜。行莊迫於頭寸，甚少拆出，故市間週轉困難。現鈔籌碼，更感枯竭。商品市塲因銀根抽緊，各物均見回挫。國行爲减少游資集中起見，除已通知各國家行局緊縮匯款業務外，並收回紗糖結款一億二千萬元，日內並將抽緊銀根，以暹灌風。此外金管局及警察局昨晨分別派員至各市塲，監視抬價行動。</p>
<p>中國銀行昨日公佈全國各地區匯款限額如次：（一）限匯百元者：遵義。安順。都勻。開遠。下關。五處。（二）限匯五百元者：宜昌。渭南。南鄭。三原。及粵省各通匯分支機構。（三）限匯一千元者：丹陽。揚州。安慶。溫州四處。　又訊：日來銀根轉緊物價普遍頓挫。據金管局負責人稱：上海始終爲一般投機市塲，致物價有暴漲暴跌之現象，此次物價瘋狂飛升，毫無理由，一遇政府有特別措施，市場卽行突變。連日因當局抽緊銀根，不健全之投機心理，卽吿擊破，今後正當商人，決不可隨波逐流，捲入漩渦。　又據另悉：日來因銀根壓緊，暗息急升，有高至一元上下者。工商業已受極大威脅，中央銀行貼放會所舉辦之生產貸款，因金融市塲轉變，將從寬審核，俾各廠商能渡過難關，維持生產。</p>
<p>物價昨日晨起以連日漲風瀰漫，各方咸感缺單，昨日銀根緊俏異常，暗息自七十元躍升一百元光景，而現鈔籌碼因外流吿湧，而各業需要見殷，故恐慌益甚。行莊退票情形，以各方頭寸緊俏之故，有顯著增加。物資市塲昨日上午市况展開猛烈跌風，午後以外埠匯款續有到滬，供求趨於平衡，拆借略見鬆弛。塲外做價，亦見回上。央行昨日存兌黃金平衡費掛低五百元，爲六千五百元，另加存兌費用爲八千五百元，暗盤金鈔亦軟。下午黃金黑市交易，因頭寸隔日交割，市况逐步盤旋上游，與前日行市相較，實屬大漲小挫。此外紗布市况均吿下挫，捲烟日用品及西藥均跌二三成，證券市况昨起開做隔日交割，市呈疲態。永紗曾低一萬六千五百元，後回上一萬九千元。台灣糖業因台匯再縮，塲外六百元，尙有吸納云。</p>
<h3>中信局呢絨紗布　今日起大量拋售</h3>
<p>據中央信託局消息，該局之代理出售政府物資委負會，爲配合當局抽緊銀根政策，決自今日起，繼續拋售大量呢絨紗布，以求達到安定市塲之目的。聞該會擁有可供拋售之物資，爲數甚鉅，此次準備拋售之呢絨紗布，其價値卽在一億元以上云。</p>
<h3>中紡大量拋售　紗布市況昨均下挫</h3>
<p>中紡昨大量售布，以配合政府措施，抽緊銀根。昨日共開出布十種，售出二二六三〇疋，零布六九〇〇磅，計金圓三七，一九八，七〇〇元。其核價爲龍頭布B十二磅細布一七〇〇元，四君子元嗶嘰一六〇〇元，B六〇〇〇，四〇碼，一〇磅坯布一八五〇元，副牌二九六，二分之一碼，嗶嘰坯一二〇〇元。B三〇磅直貢呢坯一三〇〇元，美畫岡一〇一九印花嗶嘰一八五〇元，二等品印花嗶嘰一七五〇元，跳鯉元光斜一二三〇元，跳鯉灰光斜一二二〇元，虹光精元紗直貢緞一七〇〇元。又代美援花紗會售紗四二支雙股藍鳳一七件，每件七六三〇〇元，共計金圓一二九七一〇〇元。又代中行售出二十支金雙回四三〇〇〇元，共售七二件，共計金圓三〇九六〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>紗市以銀根遍吿趨緊，圈外亦受阻力，人心渙散，空頭活躍，多頭拉抬無力，斬售不已，各紗一致下游。四二支藍鳳晨初以同業吐售現貨殊多，且客帮亦有拋出，賣氣驟盛，由六七〇〇〇元之低檔開出，嗣以多單者逢低仍有收吸，近午賣風漸止，價乃見八〇〇〇〇元高峯。午收爲七八五〇〇元，較前挫三五〇〇元。四〇支藍鳳跌三〇〇〇元，三二支銀月亦小三〇〇〇元，以六三〇〇〇元結束。二一支雙馬現貨自四三〇〇〇元喊至五一〇〇〇元爲最高。收市微回至四九〇〇〇元，終降一〇〇〇元。廠單則疲五五〇〇元。套利一天期初做四〇〇〇元，最高五〇〇〇元，最後做四五〇〇元。二〇支各檔僅小一〇〇〇元至二〇〇〇元，一六支以下各級均退入四〇〇〇元關內。</p>
<p>棉布一致狂瀉，乃傳當局繼續拋售物資，以收緊頭寸，故市上銀根普遍緊斂，圈外物品亦均迫跌，客帮因匯款未能及時到達，致將餘額拋售者不少，同業了結亦多，染廠甚鮮進出，市勢直綫挫降。龍頭細布由一九〇〇元步退至一八一〇元。收市再挫至一七〇〇元。實際成交不多。喇叭童細布自晨初一七七〇元高檔行情做開後，迄於收市，尙無人買進，但售出亦鮮。五福細布仍乏貨供應，四君子元嗶嘰開市一七七〇元，旋一路喊出至一六〇〇元站定，較前跌三八〇元。四君子元直貢軋降三四〇元，以一七四〇元結束。餘布廠盤雖見開小，但較前僅低二〇〇元左右。因燃料顏料等無不飛跳。</p>
<h3>金管局發動　第三次檢查</h3>
<p>本市各行莊，金管局曾於上月作兩度之檢查。其目的在求明瞭游資之動向，及存放業務情形。本週再作第三次之檢查，正進行中。據悉：此次係以各行莊有無弊端，及是否有違反銀行法之規定爲目的。下週可結束，一經查出，卽予嚴懲。</p>
<h3>行莊申請動用資金　昨日共核定四十件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於行莊申請動用繳存增資現金一節，本市金管局已與中央銀行洽妥，定每星期二五二日由該局根據部核行莊動用　加資本金辦法，會同國行業務局及稽核處將行莊申請書逐一提出審核。昨日曾舉行首次審核會議，共提出申請書案件四十九件，除因手續不合退還九件外，計核定四十件，准予動用增資現金約二百萬元。</p>
<h3>銀根緊俏產報抵　米麵油糧全部回跌</h3>
<p>米市轉見回跌，因銀根緊悄，貨主紛紛求脫。又以無錫價格報疲，人心更虛，早市最爲疲軟，曾見下降二三百元。旋因下降過鉅，米店逢低納取，乃吿回升百元，結果仍降一百五十至二百元，惟收市殊覺疲軟。白粳收市一千三百元，較上日低一百五十元。早稻降二百元，收市爲一千二百五十元，白元陰元各挫二百。北市各米普跌一百五十元，昨日到貨南北二市塲共計九一二七石</p>
<p>麵粉</p>

<p>雜糧</p>
<p>全部都小，因上日收市卽已下疲。昨日銀根仍緊，米價又降，乃繼續下落。惟黃豆收市因油價降少而吿稍昻，乍豆仍無開出，車豆八百三十元，較上日降一百五十元。苞米價高思危，貨主頻售，疾降二百五十至三百元。紅糧亦降二百多元，菉豆降二百元，揀靑小百餘元。芝蔴普小三百元，生仁廣帮不取，下降最厲，猛挫千元。</p>

<h3>茶價繼續上翔</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，雖在同業銀根帶緊，塲外各物猛瀉中，而貨方仍因公用事業已吿陡增，複製成本步砌不已。加以茶存薄如春冰，故態度益萌扳守，喊價繼續翱翔，是以趨勢迭吐秀氣，行情仍如脫韁野馬，再度向前疾晋。惟買戶依然染指不多，致交易成僅寥寥做開。</p>
<h3>外匯證回跌僑匯掛牌不變</h3>
<p>中央銀行昨日又委中國銀行大量拋售外匯移轉證，致市價泻跌頗勁，昨價最高一八五元，最低一六〇元，收盤時因進口商需求稍回上至一六八元進，一六九元出，較前日跌一六元。又僑匯牌價不變，仍爲一百七十元。</p>

<h3>流自已的汗　自己的飯　寗夏扶植農村復興　平均分配土地使耕者有其田　合理運用資金調農村經濟</h3>
<p>〔本報寗夏八日航訊〕寗夏居黃河的上游，其南北中各部，川原平衍，阡陌相連，溝渠縱橫，土地肥沃，所以稻麥咸宜種植，物產曩稱豐富。不過地區遼闊，人烟稀少，以致滿目荒蕪，地利未盡，深爲可惜！該省早在廿二年，卽籌設省墾植總局，策劃勢務，開全國勢政之先河；廿五年成立省地政局，以一年半的時間完成川原士地淸丈工作；抗戰開始後，當局卽以增加糧食生產爲中心工作，始終保持着全國最低糧價的耙錄，在勢務推廣方面，從廿六年到最近，共放出勢田達五十萬畝，成果不謂不豐，但據當局卅五年的統計：全省可耕的荒地在二百卅萬畝以上，而耕地不滿十畝的農戶占全農戶百分之四五·七一，不足再畝的占百分之三三·三三，可謂現有百分之七十九的農戶，都無耕地不足，勞力剩餘。（據統計密夏平均每戶人口大約七人，每人最低耕作面積以五畝計，則應爲卅五畝，始足以維持一戶之最低生活）此種現象之發生，固因遜淸以還，田制日坯，人民取巧，官吏夤緣，遂致地多隱匿，賦稅差徭不均，荒蕪逃亡，日形嚴重。廿二年以後，政治入軌，民生稍定，但因拋棄耕地過多，生產面積减少的現象，迄今仍然存在。至於土地的利用，更屬粗放，人民懶惰成性，耕作少有改進，雖有黃河的水利，尙未能達到利用的目的。</p>
<p>合法貸款法</p>
<p>凡在本省的軍政各機關，及經營存放業務的金融機構，都不得以低息把公款或資金貸放給商人，使其高利轉放，榨取農民的血汗，應由省銀行訂定辦法，仿照合作貸款辦法，一切的資金都透過合作社，貸放給承受土地從事耕作的農戶，違犯的機關如被吿發，卽呈報罰辦；商人及公敎人員有私自重利盤剝農民的，尤須從重處罰。</p>
<p>當局的呼籲</p>
<p>寗夏人口雖少，若都能以己之生活而勞作，絕不致挨餓受凍，只有不勞而獲，游墮浪蕩或染有不良嗜好的人，才是社會上的寄生蟲。省府規定人民的達到服勞役的年齡後，均應自動參加各種生產工作，沾染不良嗜好或無業游民，應立使悛改，否則鄕保甲長可隨時送交縣府管押訓誠，或編制成勞動隊，參加公耕。政府又規定每一農民，務使分養牛或騾馬至少一頭，以加强耕作能力。此項牲畜，不能視爲財產，自由變賣或作抵押品。此外，並獎勵人民承領牧塲，滋養牲畜，私人的牛馬可由政府統籌配用，但按市價償付價款。各農村間如因勞力缺乏，士地荒蕪時，政府卽組織公營農塲，利用機器或軍勢來耕種。</p>
<p>對晨民作過這樣的呼籲；生產事業，是養人的根本，如要人人有飯吃，先得人人有工作。所謂「滴目己的汗，吃自已的飯」。土地分配平均，資金運用合理，農民致力工作，則農村經濟，沒有不復興的。</p>
<p>耕者有其田</p>
<p>如今，當局因鑒於軍事的基礎，仍當求之於政治，故改善人民生活，安定社會秩序，爲首要之岡。換言之，卽必須實行平均地權，以解決土地問題，使耕者有其田；節制資本，能够善於運用資金，使農村經濟趨於活潑；倡導勤儉勞動，增加生產，以勞敎民富。其目的在以和平互助的精神求整個社會的繫榮，化除階級鬥爭，消除貧富不均，使人人有工作，有飯吃，然後匪不戡而自滅，富强康樂之新中國，可望及早實現</p>
<p>實施新方案</p>
<p>夏省政府爲實現上項的願望，最近頒佈實施土地改革扶植農村工作方案，對土地，資金，勞力的分配，運用，發揮等等，都有週詳的規定。更爲有效而澈底的執行這個方案，還訓練出一批工作人員，組成扶農工作隊，正分別到各縣去做詳盡的土地，人口，勞力，農村經濟現况的調查統計工作；同時各縣。鄉，也個別成立了扶植農村工作委員會，共問促進此一願望的實現</p>
<p>關於這個工作方案的基本精神，已如上述，現在再就各別的要點，報導一些出來：</p>
<p>農田新估計</p>
<p>據寗省府最近的估計，全省可耕的生熟地，不下六萬畝，近且擬沿賀蘭山闢一大渠道，將來還可增闢荒地三百萬畝，沿牛頭山闢一大渠道，可增田五十萬畝，如果再利用科學耕作，增加勞力資本，使土地每年兩收，無異全省有近三千萬畝的農田，用以分配全省七十萬人民，決無不敷。但省府鑒於計口授田，弊多於利，乃規定以戶爲單位，每戶一至五口規定四十畝，五至十口八十畝，十口以上的每多一口增田四畝，這樣，旣不破壞固有的社會機構，且可獎勵人口。農村的發展。現有土地的超額部份，除在方案公佈以後，可由佃農，租戶，僱農優先向地主承領外，如無人承受者，有耕作能力的退伍士兵及軍人家屬有第二優先權。承領土地的繳價，係以米麥爲標準，由承受人分十五年攤還，（但願一次繳淸或自願縮短期限的聽使）地價分三等，甲等的最高額二市石一斗，乙等的一市石五斗，丙等的一市石零五升；每年所繳地價，最高額不得超過一市斗四升。</p>
<p>取得的土地</p>
<p>超額土地的附着物如房屋。樹木等，可以附帶征收或承買，但硬性的規定着：依這方案取得的土地，必須自耕，不得出租，未經呈准的，更不得任意放棄，分割或轉移。</p>
<p>農田如有地段零碎，不合耕作經濟使用的，由政府擴展成集體農場，以耕作繼械代替勞力。至於分配剩餘的土地（公地包括在內），除保留一部份留待需要土地的農戶繼續請領外，統劃作公營農塲，發動地方勞役公耕，或交由軍隊屯勢。</p>
<p>資金的運用</p>
<p>在資金運用方面，着重於取締高利貸及活潑農村經濟，使資本善爲運用於農村生產事業，以充裕民生。這一目的的達成，首在改善借貸雙方關係，政府對投資農村的貸款，負担保證責任，並提高利息至銀幣二分至二分五厘。私人借款，訂立契約時均須註明「按年計息」，如按月計息及複利借貸等，卽認爲是重利盤剝，政府絕對的嚴格禁止。祖保方面除當地保甲長保證或以儂產物担保外，不准預以米麥約定低價，違者從重罰辦。</p>
<p>農貸的機構</p>
<p>這方案上還規定着：今後辦理農貸的機構，要與地政機關，合作組織，在業務上切取聯繫，重新計劃，對於承受耕地的農民，因取得土地或購買牛具的需用，應集中貸放，手續力求簡便，數量足够使用，務使和土地改革政策配合，不准借給不依照本方案承受土地的其他農民；而且這種農貸，戡亂軍人家屬有優先權，並由政府担保。此外，勿論公私貸款，均不准以農業生產上必需的土地，耕牛，騾馬，農具，等抵押或拍賣，償付欠債。</p>
<h3>金潮尾聲　馬鴻越俎代意</h3>
<p>— 本報特記者　彭霖</p>
<p>〔本報寗夏四日航訊〕寗夏存兌黃金風潮，經軍法處追查結果，有下落者一百三十一兩一錢四分五厘，其存兌人爲中央銀行經理程家鵬及其卷屬，職員等十三人存兌十四兩五錢零四厘，交通銀行職員王錫齡等六人存兌二十兩零四分四厘，農民銀行　理牛蔭周及其職員。眷　等八人存兌六兩九錢七分六厘，通商銀行職員韓洪元及其同事，眷屬等十一人存兌十一兩八錢六分五厘，餘客籍商民二十六人共存兌六十三兩四錢二分五厘，軍政界職員馬君如等九人共存兌十四兩三錢三分一厘，其他李子昌等八人，雖確有其人，但堅稱並未前往存兌；此外四十四名，或係化名，或無住址，已無法查對，故其餘黃金五十八兩餘，已為擁有勢力資財者化名暗購，眞上本省人民及一般低給公敎人員，未能存兌分　。</p>
<p>據馬主席鴻逵自己透露：當首批黃金運抵寗夏時，央行經理程家鵬曾轉託庶務處長趙旭東向馬氏探詢：願否購此黃金？當經馬氏嚴詞拒絕。待黃金未公開存兌，卽吿盡罄時，人民怨聲載道，全省輿論譁然，始有命令軍法處澈查黃金存兌戶姓之措施。　本案至此已近尾聲，馬主席鴻逵曾爲此佈吿各界，說明查辦之苦衷，全爲愛民心切，並無「越俎代庖」之意。其佈吿中有云：「本主席若澈底查究，全案必能大白……但環顧大局，華北風雲緊急，淮上血戰方酣，該行（按：指央行寗分行）又不隸屬於本府，此事又無關乎大局，實不願以一隅之細故，上煩總統之宸衷，然社會惡勢力之龐大，財務人員之自私，於此可見一斑。本主席爲此不公平之事，辦法想盡，力量用完，無如世風不古，人心陷溺，貪財岡利者多，急公好義者少，雖欲主張公道，辨別是非，其奈爲惡勢力所阻，致全案未辦澈底，實惠朱及人民，本主席自覺德薄能鮮，馭衆無方，上無以對中樞之付託之重，下無以慰父老期望之殷，午夜自思，寢饋難安！惟職責已盡，意思表明，各界父老，當能見諒。」</p>

<h3>新年話杭州　建設文化城問題再提出</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州九日訊〕一九四九年的新年，劇作家熊佛西，離塑家劉開渠和上海市立實騐戲劇學校敎負邱要三位先生聯袂到杭州來，劉先生一見我的面就說：「我同情你在申報上連續不斷地爲建設杭州文化城而努力的主張！」他在戰前是國立西湖藝專的敎授，已經與杭州久違了二十年，他說：「杭州實在是理想的文化城，杭州除了走向文化城的建設外，可說別無他途。」</p>
<p>連記者在內，我們曾和作家孫福熙先生交換意見，他很平就同情我的主張。我們又去找畫家倪貽德先生，同往淨慈守。虎跑。玉皇山。龍井寺。龍井村等地遊玩，凡到一個地方，都浮泛起建設文化城方面應有的具體設計。</p>
<p>廣大的文化活動　玉皇山不致孤立</p>
<p>我們覺得這許多名勝古蹟，雖然像玉皇山那樣經過人工不斷的整理，但它對整個社會的貢獻究還是微小的，它不過是向有錢有閒者賣弄風精，而沒有眞正的現實的偉大價値，因爲它沒有受過文化的洗煉。因此，我們覺得它近於庸俗，甚至還不如龍井寺和龍井村那樣的包含着淳樸原始的情調。貽德先生說：玉皇山如果變爲藝術專校，也是不合式的，因爲新的寫實主義是要接近人民，接近現實的，我說：話還得說過來，如果有許多交通車可以廉價送人民到玉皇山，而在人民獲得適當休息的時候，而玉皇山上有廣大的文化活動，則玉皇山也不會太「孤立」的。在我們的傾談中，可說對上下，古今，中外都加以一一的討論，從皮加索的畫談到中國幾位近代的畫家，從意大利。法蘭西的建築，談到中國杭州風景區內的建築。舉凡音樂。戲劇等等無听不談。</p>
<p>開門歡迎文化人質量上擴展機構</p>
<p>我們曾談到一般的文藝工作者們，往往爲環境所限制，而不能開拓環境，戰勝環境，因此影響他們的作品，影響他們的前途。所以我們對於杭州，不能僅在現實上認爲滿足，不能僅以在現實中加以建設爲滿足，而應該有一個較遠大較光明的理想。</p>
<p>當然，杭州要建設爲文化城，首先應該要容留文化人在這塊土地上耕耘操作。首先要杭州本身敞開着大門歡迎他們，從而在質與量兩方面擴展，並提高文化機構，使他們有工可做，有事可求，才能發揮他們的才具。</p>
<p>藝展基礎當擴大　藝術館萬應設立</p>
<p>照目前講：國立西湖藝術專科學校應該擴展他的基礎，現在的藝專，儘多的是繪畫，加以極少的雕塑，自不能稱為完備的藝術專門學校，當必使西湖藝專內設美術·音樂·雕塑·戲劇·舞踴。建築等系，則藝專成了專門研究各種藝術上的理論體系與生活實踐的中心機構。</p>
<p>除了藝專外，另外最好設立一所藝術館，藝術館址，如能新建最佳，否則也可商得英士街的敎育會同意，把敎育會租來加以改造。這藝術館是藝術活動的中心，可以此爲基點，展開各項藝術活動，與研究學問的藝術專校兩相配合，取得密切的連繫，循着各個季節，努力各項運動。</p>
<p>倘能擴展藝專的基礎以及增設了藝術館，則已能容納較多量的文化人士，從而可以使杭州文化城獲得了雛型的胚胎。當然，這裏還需要關於純文藝的雜誌，優良而專門傳播文化種子的報紙，以及各種有關文化事業的刋物。</p>
<p>當局對美化杭州應擬定統盤計劃</p>
<p>杭州市政府當須採納文化人士的意見，來美化杭州的都會，同時，在市上的建築，在何處以建築何種型式的房屋爲宜，如在臨湖應建中式而有古色古香型，在住宅區則可建西式，在商業區則可建高大的洋樓等等，都要預先規劃一定的格式，與統盤的計劃。在何處植何種林木，如沿湖應多種垂柳，山間多種果木等等，也都要有適當的佈置。</p>
<p>有人以爲，在這戰亂頻仍的時代，還談什麼藝術文化？殊不知唯有藝術文化始能消弭戰爭，使人民普遍獲得藝術文化的滋養，始能生活得積極，向上，而且進步。惟其今日戰亂頻仍，所以我們更當迫切呼籲作文化城的建設</p>
<p>我們嘗聽陳公洽主席謂將設立文化館，　意果好，惟文化包括範圍甚廣：所以希望能將文化館改爲藝術館，而急切地予以實現。我們曾和任顯羣市長閒談，他也同情枕州建設爲文化城，惟同情猶嫌不足，應將今後建設以文化建設爲中心，並希望能有具體的計劃而促其一一實現。</p>
<p>倪貽德先生吿記者：「關於你所作建設杭州爲文化城的主張，我同情你，而且支持你，西湖藝術研究所的成立，可說是事實上的聲援！」</p>
<p>我們數人相約：今後我們的所作所爲，當必爲實踐建設杭州這個文化城的理想而努力！</p>
<h3>夷族觀光後新</h3>
<p>〔本報雅安一月六日航訊〕西康的夷族觀光團，自從到京滬等地觀光歸來後，各個團員對夷務已經是發生了極優良的影響：（一）各團員在歸家以後，把這次出行的經過與觀感與乎元首各院部首長所賜給他們的照片，畫片，武器連同在上海所灌製的留聲片這類東西，分別向他們的親友，並深入大凉山的夷巢裏去宣傳，闡揚政府德意，備述人類進化的情形，這些夷胞深受感動，思想也因之轉變，領心向化了。最近由團員羅大英。羅鎭江。羅本呷。果雞馬達等率領窪里。巴哲。瓜別。普雄等地，從來莫有到過西昌的夷人首領羅洪長等數十人，紛紛的自動到西昌去，表示絕對擁護政府，安定邊區。（二）夷胞認漢夷是一家，已經莫有彼此的區分，他們並覺悟要想把夷胞進步的話，應該從文化敎育方面着手，他們在西昌組織一個夷族文化協會分會。推孫仿。王濟民爲正副個長，廣大夷區現在已掀起興學的熱潮。各地夷人的首領，最近　集在西昌，要求政府指導協助他們開辦邊民敎育，業已決定劃夷區的巴哲。普雄。北山。寗東這四個地方爲敎育區一共籌備設立邊民小學十八所，推定專人負責籌辦，定於明春開學，現所有的校舍已經修築完成了。他們又請政府發展交通，自己願意出力修築，使夷胞的文化經濟發達起來，造成一個繁榮的區城。</p>

<h3>宜與野山茶</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員　朱向高</p>
<p>本報通訊員</p>
<p>〔本報宜興九日訊〕宜興本來說不上是個產茶區，遠在陶器茶壺行銷海內外以後，植茶事遂逐漸爲人注意，成了主要副業之一。淸光緒年間，產大紅袍一種，為茶中奪色，皇室專人來宜採辦御用，那時始名噪一時，引起一般民間種植的興趣，由此產量激增，一躍而爲江蘇省有名的產茶區，控制了大江南北的大量市塲，但是流傳迄今，非但沒有發達，而且日見沒落。探本求源，這實在不僅是部份農村間的問題，推測過去，也未始不是中國茶業在外匯市塲上被印度。錫蘭。諸茶淘汰的癥結所在，如何力圖振興，實爲當前的嚴重問題。</p>
<p>產茶地區份佈</p>
<p>茶戶只能利用質壞較佳的山地種植，因此可以利用的山地很少，山農也大都被限制於有限的平山，故正式產茶的地區僅張渚，湖汶，及南郊的百合塲，共一百餘畝左右，每年可分別在三，五，七諸月採爲雨前，明前，春紅，三種。待三茶過後大部茶戶卽預備紥草過冬了，但是還有少數貧戶，仍有在年內摘第四次茶者，該茶卽名爲過冬靑，不過所採下的旣粗糙不堪，來春生長也須受重大損害，沒有辦法過冬的茶戶，頗多這樣飲鴆止喝，他們的採摘，都墨守陳法，順着樹枝的茶葉，向外一勒，以致多是粗糙的茶梗，再加上有時售價幷不高於成本的反常現象，在在都是質地未見改良的桎梏，造成現在的一蹶不振，如今僅行銷在京滬及大江以北，乃因質地不加改良，粗製濫造，已從高貴的客廳裏，被眨入了冷宮之目下僅充旅社，浴室，茶館的牛飲吧了，且日在被浙皖產茶所淘汰，據戰前統計每年銷出有卅萬担左右，如今蘇北一片火海，出口大受打擊，又不能在滬杭一爭長短，自己又不求進步，怎能叫他不沒落，但可喜的是如今已獲得了轉機的曙光，像給人發現了有希望的處女地一樣。</p>
<p>茶樹出息稀少</p>
<p>在七個偶然的場合裏樵人在深山裏，發見了幾株如火如荼的茶花，採了煎着一嗜，有特殊滋味，茶戶認爲奇蹟，爲本縣茶業開闢了一條新途徑。關於這種品質，迄無專家的考究，大家只得混稱爲「野山茶」，顧名思義是被埋藏在深山荒嶺之間，是要有耐心的人去發掘的。由於數量的稀少，雖然已有了出世近百年的歷史，然市上仍未多見，爲一般人所享用，未被推廣開去，像是未被發掘的寳藏，大概是土壤天然投合植茶的性質野山茶的超然新異，是沒有其他原因可供研究，記者去訪問一家擁有十餘畝山地的富有茶戶，偕同了上山去參觀他的茶園，在並不過高的平山上，一片平陽，高矮參差的茶樹，靑葱翠鬱，一望無隙煞爲壯觀，有的在樹行間，甚至劃出整塊土地種植山芋，黃豆因爲茶樹出息少，不得不向植種些其他雜糧以資補助，裏面難得有幾株，是他從遠處移植過來的野山茶樹，樣子顯得格外瘦小，承他很珍視地摘了少許，卽在他家裏煮了吃，確屬名不虛傳味與色，香俱會愈久則愈醇厚，與祁門，龍井相較，猶如隸顏之書法別成一家，雖經沸水四次，仍碧然鮮綠，決非市上出售品所可比擬於萬一。</p>
<p>毛尖佔鼇頭</p>
<p>野山中尤以毛尖爲最佳，雖經工焙烤後，葉上仍留有一層細毛，以「野山毛尖」爲個中翹楚卽憑此以別眞僞如今雖已爲一般茶戶移養，然旣以產量稀少，人工昂貴，終未爲京滬市塲注意及投資經營，唯恐移養後，會得不償失，故迄今仍未見抬頭一般茶戶，旣未能謀改良土質及產量，又無移植興趣，每年僅在深秋，有大茶戶去覓採一次，按茶業公會統計，今年山間僅運出十數担，均爲城內識貨鄕紳茶客搜集珍藏殆盡，備着自己慢慢滋味，市上雖然有極少量的出售，什九膺品，騙騙外行吧了</p>
<p>爲茶葉增彩</p>
<p>最近乃有幾家大茶行的企業巨商，憧憬着以前茶產的全盛，發起組織宜興茶葉產銷合作社，中心工作，除了改良增產外擬大量移植野山茶研究土壤的培製，技術方式雖然不能與海外茶市一放異彩，然據記者觀察，決爲浙。皖。諸茶勁敵，他們已於元旦開始實施這個計劃，他們甘願忍痛下昂貴成本的開墾，竭力避免中間商的剝削，號召大茶戶爲基本社負，指導全縣所有茶農改良品種，竭力墾植大宗野山茶，計劃於第一年度增產萬祖，家茶五十萬担，自產自銷，開闢新市塲，從沒落裏重新步上繁榮之道。</p>

<h3>Declaration Passed by the Control Yuan: Calling for an Immediate Ceasefire and Peace Negotiations; Promoting Ju Zheng and Others to Plan Concrete Steps</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Yujing (Nanjing), 11th] The entire body of members of the Control Yuan, in the 34th Yuan meeting on the morning of the 11th, discussed and passed a declaration calling for peace. Besides explaining the suffering imposed on the people by the war, calling for the sake of the country, the people, and future generations to immediately cease fire and seek peace, it also stated that the true victory should consider how to win the hearts of the people and how to realize the peace that the people of the whole country unanimously hope for. It hoped that the leaders of the Communist Party would prioritize the people. If peace can be realized, then everyone should relinquish their own rights and positions to thank the people. Even the Control Yuan members are willing to step aside for virtuous and capable people in a timely manner. During the discussion at the Yuan meeting on the morning of the 11th, all members maintained an objective attitude, seeking to avoid any bias in the wording towards either the Kuomintang or the Communist Party. The Yuan meeting on the 11th was presided over by the Yuan President himself and was carefully passed after thorough and enthusiastic discussion. Subsequently, a temporary proposal from Tang Honglie and others was discussed, proposing several opinions on concrete actions to promote peace talks. After discussion, it was considered that a declaration of peace already existed. As for the proposed measures, it was decided to assign members to study them first and then make a decision. The opinions are as follows: (1) Telegraph the President, President Sun, and Mao Zedong to immediately cease military actions and promptly appoint commissioners to be responsible for planning concrete steps for peace negotiations and to appoint representatives for peace talks, making effective and forceful progress swiftly. (2) The Yuan, in the name of all Control Yuan members in Nanjing, invites Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, Wu Zhongxin, etc., to discuss issues related to peace. (3) Appoint three to five representatives to visit the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to China, purely as representatives of public opinion, to explain the desire for peace, request that they convey this to their respective governments, and engage in mediation nearby. (4) Appoint five to seven members to collect relevant materials and study issues related to peace, in order to provide relevant parties with options at any time, and to maintain regular contact with the specially appointed peace negotiators, in order to promote and mediate. The members appointed to conduct the research were Ju Zheng, Wang Xiangchen, Jin Yueguang, Sun Yulin, Tang Honglie, Liu Pingjiang, Zhang Wanzhen, Ren Bingjun, Qi Dapeng, and Chen Yushan, and Ju Zheng was appointed to convene the group.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Members of the Legislative Yuan remaining in Nanjing held a forum on the current situation. After a meeting in the afternoon of the 10th, they decided to continue the meeting at 3:00 PM on the 14th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] Many legislators are discussing drafting a peace plan acceptable to both sides to promote the current peace movement.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Control Yuan's Declaration</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The entire body of Control Yuan members convened on the 11th and revised and passed a declaration calling for peace. The full text is as follows: The peace that the people of the whole country unanimously expect has already shown a glimmer of hope since the President's New Year's Day message this year. However, as the situation has evolved to this day, it is still wavering in a stage of indecision between peace and war, which is extremely worrying. We, the members of the Control Yuan, entrusted by the people, cannot but frankly and sincerely inform the people of the country of the advantages, disadvantages, and the essence of striving for peace at this critical juncture.</p>
<p>The eight-year War of Resistance against Japan has severely damaged the country's vitality. After victory, wars and disasters have resumed, with corpses lying across the fields, and those rolling in ravines are even more numerous. This kind of tragic sacrifice of lives is an irreparable loss for our Chinese nation. At the same time, in the economic aspect, fields are barren, rural areas are bankrupt, transportation is cut off, and industry and commerce are萎缩, all production forces are in a state of standstill and collapse. If this continues, it will fundamentally destroy the livelihood of the Chinese nation and its future generations. We have personally experienced the evil consequences of this war and are heartbroken by it. The people of the whole country really cannot endure it any longer, nor can they continue to endure it. Therefore, we urgently call on you to abandon war, cease fire on the spot, and seek peace for the sake of the country, the people, and future generations.</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People, created by Sun Yat-sen, are the founding principles of our country. This has long been recognized by the people of the whole country and jointly recognized by parties during the Political Consultative Conference era. However, the implementation of these principles must be based on peace and can never be resolved through war. Moreover, war is the root of disaster, not only can it not solve the various problems of the country and society, but it also increases the severity of various problems. Just look at the various measures of the government today, which are棘手 everywhere, and the suffering of the people is deepening day by day. In the Communist-occupied areas, the people are also exhausted and impoverished. None of them can solve the problems of the people. Moreover, even if military victory can seize a city or a place, the evil consequences of war only increase the suffering of the people and lose the hearts of the people. Therefore, the real victory should consider how to win the hearts of the people and how to realize the peace that the people of the whole country unanimously and earnestly hope for. Relying on force cannot achieve the goal.</p>
<p>President Chiang's message clearly stated that everything is based on the interests of the country, regardless of personal advancement or retreat. This frank attitude is truly admirable. However, the realization of peace cannot place all the responsibility on one party or one person. Therefore, we hope that the leaders in the government must all emulate President Chiang's spirit of humility and dedication to the country, abandon prejudices, and strive for peace. At the same time, we also ask the leaders of the Communist Party to have the same broad-mindedness, prioritize the people, cease fire and make peace. Once peace is realized, we further advocate that everyone relinquish their own rights and positions to thank the people.</p>
<p>We, the members of the Control Yuan, respectfully oversee the laws and regulations, and deeply regret that our talents and virtues are meager and cannot help overcome the difficulties of the times. If peace can be realized at an early date, we are also eager to follow in the footsteps of all gentlemen and retire and recommend virtuous and capable people.</p>
<p>The 20th century is the century of the people, and the people are the masters of the country. The political affairs of the country should be decided by the people. We, the people, should no longer endure the oppression of a few people and be their slaves, nor should we be driven by warmongers and be their cannon fodder. Since the government has spoken out for the people and expressed its willingness to cease fire and make peace, if the Communist Party values the people's livelihood, there is no reason to wage war again. We demand life and do not allow the exploitation of corrupt officials and corrupt bureaucrats. We demand freedom and survival and do not allow the threats of terror and cruel wars to exist again. At this time when the call for peace fills the universe, we must call for peace on the one hand and strengthen unity and strengthen our own strength on the other hand to strive for peace and protect peace.</p>

<h3>The Air Force Covers the Du Department's Active Breakout and Arrives in a Favorable Area; The More Than One Month of Hard Defense of Qinglongji Has Actually Achieved the Mission</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chuxian, 11th] The Du Yuming Department has officially突园 to the northwest area of Qinglongji. The Qiu and Li Corps and part of the Sun Corps, about 12 armies, took the initiative to withdraw from Xuzhou on December 3 last year. Along the way, they eliminated the resistance of the Communist bandits. On the 6th, the National Army advanced to the central area between Qinglongji in the east of Yongcheng, Suixikou, and Zhao Jiaji. They were repeatedly surrounded by superior bandits. By January 5, the Chen and Liu bandit部 had gradually增援. The numbers of the units found reached 12 columns, about 300,000 people. In addition to digging five deep and wide trenches of several丈 around the area to prevent the activities of the National Army's mechanized部队, they also concentrated thousands of various types of cannons and densely擎the National Army position with a diameter of less than 15 kilometers. After each bombardment, they followed up with human sea tactics and launched a 肉搏衝鋒 on the National Army. Therefore, the fierceness of the battle was unprecedented since the Xing of the National Army. Although the defending army had air transport supplies, it had to take the initiative to break out formally to the northwest area of Qinglongji north of Yongcheng under the cover of the Air Force due to factors such as the frozen ground, cold weather, long distance for reinforcements, disparity in strength, and insufficient ammunition and grain. By the time of the telegram, the National Army had turned to a certain favorable area. According to the investigation, the Du Department had guarded the area near Qinglongji for more than a month, killing and wounding about 200,000 bandits. The military generally believed that it had successfully completed the mission and obtained the greatest 代价 and the highest results.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] After five days of fierce battle, Du Yuming led his troops to launch an attack and advance from the Chen Guanzhuang battlefield in three directions before dawn on the 10th. It is learned that the elite light infantry of the Qiu Qingquan 部隊 were all among them, while most of the Li Mi 部隊 sacrificed in the fierce battle on the 5th. The actions of this breakout部队 in the next few days will be even more difficult than the process of the Huang Wei Corps' southward breakout. Although the官兵心志 is坚忍, their physical strength is exhausted due to 44 days of野战 life since going south from Xuzhou on November 29. It is learned that two columns of the Liu Bocheng 部隊, who are good at the car wheel warfare method, have moved west and north from the Gu town stronghold of the Jinpu Railway and预佈狙击栈 in the Mengcheng area. Therefore, although the Du Yuming 部 has tens of thousands of attack moves at present, it is difficult to predict whether it can safely reach the intended location. Today, various types of fighter jets of the Air Force covered the actions of the Du Yuming 部隊 in the sky over the途程, continuously攻击擎 the bandit army hindering the Du 部隊. The captain's plane of the 17th squadron of the Yingzai's Third Brigade was also damaged by the bandits, and the parachute failed to open, and he sacrificed his life when he fell to the ground.</p>

<h3>No New Developments in International Mediation; Our Government Awaits Reply; Envoys of Four Powers Also Await Instructions from Their Home Countries</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Regarding the international mediation of our domestic disputes to promote peace, there were no new developments on the 11th. Our government is awaiting the reply from the four countries, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, to the memorandum submitted by Foreign Minister兼 (concurrently) Wu on the 8th. The envoys of the four countries are also waiting for instructions from their respective governments. Figures in diplomatic circles are maintaining extreme silence on this matter, offering no comments or speculations. [United Press, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] According to reliable sources confirmed on the 11th, none of the four powers has yet responded to China's request for mediation. Qualified observers predict that the responses from the United States, the United Kingdom, and France will be favorable to the government, but the Soviet Union is a major question. It is pointed out that without the assistance of the Soviet Union, contact with the Communists is almost impossible. It is still unknown whether China has requested the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to use their diplomatic influence to urge the Soviet Union to participate in the mediation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th Dispatch] The diplomatic correspondent of the London Times reports that the Chinese government's call for the four powers, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, to mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists to promote peace is now being considered sympathetically by various countries. However, the immediate reaction in diplomatic circles here is that unless the Soviet Union, which seems unlikely to participate, joins the mediation, foreign mediation seems unlikely to persuade the Communists, who are militarily dominant, to hold negotiations with the National Government. Considering Marshall's past experience, diplomatic circles here are highly skeptical whether foreign mediators are qualified to find a basis for negotiations between the two sides.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Current Prices</h3>
<p>Under the repeated mistakes of the gold exchange policy, Shanghai prices have soared to unprecedented peaks, especially the sharp rise in the prices of rice, yarn, oil, and coal, which heavily oppresses everyone. In order to curb this rising trend, the financial authorities and the central bank authorities took emergency measures on the 11th, on the one hand, lowering the gold equalization fee by 500 yuan, and on the other hand, throwing out a large amount of materials, so yesterday's prices slightly turned back to fall, ranging from 10% to 20-30%. This is just a setback in the mad price surge, not a natural decline, and the future situation is still worrying.</p>
<p>The rise in Shanghai prices is no longer surprising news, it has become an inevitable phenomenon of the social economy. However, in addition to the two main causes of war and inflation, other factors are not the same for each price increase, nor are they completely the same, and these factors often lead to the most frantic rise. Recently, prices have repeatedly hit peaks, with the rise in daily necessities being the most violent, rather than a general rise in all kinds of goods. Naturally, other kinds of goods are also affected by the rise and soar. According to the third survey of the cost of living index in this month's previous issue on the 11th, prices have risen by another 30-40% since the second survey. Comparing the results with the previous two surveys, it should be one times the previous issue's index. For example, rice has risen by 120%, oil has risen by 130%, yarn has risen by 100%, coal has risen by 200%, and water and electricity have risen to one and a half times. Only the rise in rent and other items is still less than one times. This shows that in this price surge in Shanghai, only a few people have gained profits, while the majority of honest and hardworking people are still suffering from the heavy high pressure of life, living a life of famine, terror, and chaos.</p>
<p>In summary, there are about four factors causing this soaring price rise: First, it is the authorities' mishandling of the gold exchange policy, especially after the gold equalization fee was added, which stimulated the rise in prices. The gold equalization fee is almost the same as the black market, and speculators continue to swallow it, so a new black market has emerged, which has a significant impact on prices; Second, the circular expansion of inflation and fiscal deficits has ruthlessly stimulated prices. The government's only financial weapon now is the issuance of currency. In short, inflation leads to high prices, high prices lead to an increasingly large fiscal deficit, and an increasingly large fiscal deficit requires the issuance of a larger number of currency. This continues in a cycle, which will directly promote a wider range of price increases and make the upward trend of prices more uncontrollable. This is the fundamental reason for the soaring prices in recent years, and this trend has become more intense recently; Third, the prevalence of hoarding stimulates prices. When people experience that the purchasing power of gold yuan coupons is constantly decreasing, they develop a mentality of "valuing goods more than currency," so as soon as they have cash in hand, they immediately use it to buy goods. Most of them are indeed daily necessities such as rice, coal, oil, and yarn, but there are also many who use this to preserve the value of their property. As a result, there is an increasing shortage of goods in the market. At the same time, the habit of immediately using cash to buy goods as soon as it is in hand has greatly increased the circulation speed of gold yuan coupons. The current price increase of several times a day without falling is due to the excessive and rapid circulation speed of gold yuan coupons; Fourth, the turbulent and unstable war situation and political situation have led to a shortage of some rice and coal sources in the interior, which are all reasons for deepening the chaos and flooding of price changes.</p>
<p>Based on the above four factors that cause the soaring price phenomenon, the development trend will be a very serious matter. To curb this vicious surge, or to eradicate this surge, the only way is to achieve domestic peace. In fact, only peace can save human suffering. This is the fundamental way to clarify the current socio-economic problems. Passive and superficial methods, such as the measures currently taken by the central bank, such as lowering the gold equalization fee, or drastically tightening credit, or throwing out materials in a planned way, may depress prices to rebound, but it is impossible to completely fall. It only shows a temporary expansion and contraction of prices. Therefore, we are not optimistic about the future of prices, which are currently in a state of large increases and small declines.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Is Actively Planning to Store Three Months' Worth of Grain in Six Major Cities; The Storage in Nanjing and Shanghai Is Still Less Than Half</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] According to the Grain News Agency: The Executive Yuan is actively planning a plan to store three months' worth of grain in six major cities: Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Guangzhou. Due to transportation difficulties, it is difficult to achieve in Peiping and Tianjin. In the other four cities, the Emergency Grain Storage and Purchase Committee and the local municipal governments will each be responsible for half of the predetermined amount. The funds required for purchase and storage will be lent by the central bank. According to reliable sources, Shanghai needs to store more than 1.7 million dan of grain for three months, and Nanjing needs to store 366,000 dan.

<h3>Distribution of Civilian Food in Qingdao; Inferior Quality and Adulteration Discovered; Whose Responsibility It Is Remains to Be Investigated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 11th Dispatch] In the distribution of civilian food in Qingdao, a large batch of inferior and adulterated products was discovered. The flour was like fried rice flour and was inedible, causing an uproar in the city. It was found that the ECA allocated 9,000 tons of wheat to Qingdao and signed contracts with Shuangfu and Qilu companies to grind it into finished products, which were then controlled by the ECA and allocated to the Civil Affairs Association for distribution. Reports say that the fraudulent flour was produced by Qilu Company, which apparently mixed in a large amount of yuan wheat and water. The person in charge of the Civil Affairs Association said that the association's responsibility was only in distribution and had no right to inspect. The person in charge of Qilu Company's flour mill claimed that it was caused by a machine malfunction, but since the ECA had already inspected it, there should be no problem. This matter will obviously threaten the credibility of the ECA. Hawkins, the 28-year-old person in charge of the ECA here, will also find it thorny. Whose responsibility it is remains to be investigated.</p>

<h3>Chennault Is Willing to Lead If a Volunteer American Air Force Is Organized; Believes That China's Current War Is a Civil War</h3>
<p>[United Press, Local Dispatch] General Chennault, the famous leader of the "Flying Tigers" during the War of Resistance, reiterated today his willingness to lead an American volunteer team to fight for the Chinese government, and said that this move could still be effective, but the team must have proper organization and supply, and cooperate with the Chinese Air Force. The proposal to organize a new volunteer team was made several weeks ago. Some former members of the US 14th Air Force volunteered to return to China and suggested that Chen lead them. Although this matter has aroused support and opposition, Washington officials have not expressed any opinion. According to Chen's conversation with reporters, President Chiang has not asked him to organize a new volunteer team. Although he had notified the President of the willingness of former members of the 14th Air Force to serve, he has not received a reply. He believes that the current war in China is not a civil war, but a war between communism and everything that is not communist. The majority of Chinese who oppose communism will welcome a new American volunteer team; those who are inclined to communism will oppose it, but he knows that most Chinese are opposed to communism. Some observers criticize that the Chinese Air Force does not fight, or is not enthusiastic about fighting. He does not agree with this. The Chinese Air Force has been trained to fight enemy air forces, but has not been trained to assist ground operations or attack ground targets, but its performance is also quite good. Chen is unwilling to predict what the fate of the China National Aviation Corporation, which has occupied the entire mainland, will be, but he said that he does not hope to continue operating in China under the control of the Communist Party.</p>

<h3>Nanjing Memorial Meeting for Cai Yuanpei's Birthday; Hu Shi Speaks on the History of the Annotation of the Waterways Classic</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Today is the 82nd anniversary of the birth of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, the former president of Peking University and the founder of Academia Sinica. The Nanjing Peking University Alumni Association and colleagues from Academia Sinica held a memorial meeting at 10:00 am at No. 1 Jiming Temple. Zhu Jiahua, the chairman, said briefly that Mr. Cai was not only the founder of the new culture, but also the pioneer of new political thought. His spirit of loving truth, safeguarding freedom, promoting democracy, and promoting science will always be a model for the world. Those who participated in the grand event today included Wang Chonghui, Wang Shijie, Shen Shiyuan, Di Ying, Li Shuhua, Fu Sinian, Chen Xueping, Yang Zhongjian, Hang Liwu, and others, totaling more than 300 people. Then, Hu Shi gave a lecture on "A Brief History of the Annotation of the Waterways Classic in the Past Four Hundred Years." The main points of Hu's speech are as follows: The original text of the Waterways Classic is only a few thousand words, and it was drafted around the Eastern Han Dynasty and completed in the Three Kingdoms period, with a total of 137 entries, of which 123 are still extant. During the Northern Wei Dynasty, Li Daoyuan wrote the Annotation of the Waterways Classic. He personally traveled to all the waterways in the north, so he was able to collect detailed information. For the waterways in the south, he fully utilized the books published in the south at that time as reference. The book was completed with 345,000 words, becoming a great work. During the Song Dynasty, two editions were circulated in Chengdu, Sichuan, but there were many omissions and errors, and the classic and the annotation were mixed together, making it difficult for researchers to start. The Huang's edition in the Ming Dynasty not only had some collations, but also had missing pages. Even only half of Li Daoyuan's original preface remained. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Maobu of the imperial family re-engraved it in the 43rd year of Wanli, correcting many errors. During the Qing Dynasty, when compiling the Comprehensive Geography of the Qing Dynasty, Gu Zuyu and Huang Yi used scientific tools such as maps and scientific methods to make the study of the Annotation of the Waterways Classic enter a new stage. Speaking of the history of the annotation of the Waterways Classic in the past four hundred years, Hu especially praised the great contributions of Dai Dongyuan and Quan Zuwang, saying that they actually came to the same conclusion by different routes and there was no mutual plagiarism at all. Duan Yucai, Wang Guowei, and Meng Sen, etc., had lengthy written lawsuits for this, which was emotional and could not be done with a calm and objective attitude. Finally, Hu reported on the process of annotating the Waterways Classic. He had been working on it for five years since 1943, and it is now coming to an end. Recently, Peking University held its 50th anniversary celebration and exhibited more than 70 versions of the Waterways Classic, including the most precious Yongle Encyclopedia edition.</p>

<h3>Ministry of National Defense Promulgates "Measures for Establishing Conscription Teams and Military Service Mutual Aid Groups During the Suppression of Rebellion Period"</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Ministry of National Defense, in order to meet the military needs of suppressing the rebellion, previously drafted and promulgated the Essentials of Conscription During the Rebellion Period. Now, in order to protect the livelihoods of the families of soldiers who have gone to war, and to cooperate with local people's self-defense training, so as to strengthen county-level conscription work, the Ministry has separately formulated and promulgated "Measures for Establishing Conscription Teams and Military Service Mutual Aid Groups in Each County (City) During the Suppression of Rebellion Period." These measures will be implemented uniformly across the country on January 13th. These measures are the most basic of the basic work of military service. The full text is recorded as follows: (A) General Principles</p>
<p>1.  These measures are formulated in accordance with Article 7, Page 9 of the Supplementary Measures to the Regulations on the Organization and Training of People's Self-Defense Teams, and Articles 3, 6, and 17 of the Essentials of Conscription During the Suppression of Rebellion Period.</p>
<p>2.  In order to strengthen county-level conscription work and maintain the livelihoods of the families of soldiers who have gone to war, each county (city) should immediately establish conscription teams and military service mutual aid groups in order to balance rights and obligations. (B) Organization and Management of Conscription Teams 3. Conscription teams in each township (town/district) should be organized from able-bodied men aged 20 to 25 who pass the physical examination. The organization should be done once every year at the beginning of the year. The following year, new men who have reached the age of 20 should be added, and those who have reached the age of 26 should be removed. 4. Conscription teams, in preparation for conscription, should be organized at the beginning of each year in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Essentials of Conscription During the Rebellion Period, according to the principle of the number of family members in each team member's household, pre-dividing them into two types: priority team members and reserve team members. After the priority team members are conscripted, reserve team members will be selected to fill the vacancies. The priority team members must always maintain a number equal to 1% of the total population of the common township (town/district). When conscripted into the army, reserve team members must be immediately selected to fill the quota. If the reserve team members cannot meet the quota after selection according to regulations, the age limit may be extended. The age limit for such extension shall be determined by the provinces (cities) after obtaining approval through an order. The selection and replacement of the aforementioned priority team members shall be carried out in accordance with Article 10 of these Measures, proposed by the third subgroup of each Jia, and convened by the Bao chief to convene the subgroups of each Jia under their jurisdiction, jointly reviewing and selecting them. 5. Each township (town/district) should organize one conscription team, with each Bao forming one detachment, and each detachment forming several groups. Each group should be formed on average with one priority team member and several reserve team members. Jias without priority team members should be combined with neighboring Jias.</p>
<p>Each team and detachment shall have one team leader and one deputy team leader, concurrently held by the township (town/district) Bao chief and the township (town/district) Bao deputy team leader. The group leader shall be publicly elected from among the reserve team members. The team leaders and deputy team leaders at all levels shall be appointed by the county (city) People's Self-Defense Headquarters and reported to the county (city) government for record. After the conscription teams are organized, the township (town/district) shall, taking the Bao as the unit, announce them according to group and the order of priority team members and reserve team members. 6. The team leaders and deputy team leaders at all levels of the conscription team shall be responsible for investigating, organizing, controlling, training, encouraging, and supervising the conscription team members. Once a conscription order is received from the county (city), they shall immediately select and conscript according to the prescribed number from the priority team members in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Essentials of Conscription, and if required, concentrate and escort them to the county (city) conscription office. 7. The priority team members of the conscription team should be prepared for conscription at any time and should not leave the township (town/district) without authorization. The reserve team members of the group shall be the legally responsible guarantors. If reserve team members leave the township (town/district) for any reason, they must report to and obtain approval from the Bao chief to which they belong, and obtain a written guarantee from two or more reserve team members of the same group, and submit it to the township (town/district) office for the issuance of an exit permit. Any priority team member who leaves the township without authorization, and any reserve team member who leaves the township without reporting for approval, shall be dealt with in accordance with Article 8 of the Statute for Punishing Offenses Against Military Service. Before the unauthorized priority team members who left the territory are arrested and brought to justice, one person from the reserve team members of the group shall be selected to make up for the vacancy. If counties (cities) (townships) (towns/districts) find any conscription team members entering the territory without an exit permit, they may be required to serve in the military and be allowed to fill the quota.</p>
<p>8. Each township (town/district) conscription team should create three copies of the roster, one for its own safekeeping, and the other two submitted to the county (city) government to which it belongs for approval. One copy will be kept by the county (city) government, and one copy will be handed over to the People's Self-Defense Headquarters for safekeeping and use. In addition to the above-mentioned listing, priority team members must also create a register of men of age for active duty in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Conscription Processing Rules. Reserve team members are exempt from creating the register. 9. If local financial resources permit, priority team members may be concentrated for training in the township (town/district) first. If this is not possible, they should be trained regularly without interrupting production. Reserve team members only need to be registered and controlled, and do not need to be trained.

<h3>Representatives of Various Countries Intend to Request the Security Council to Order Dutch Troops to Withdraw to Their Original Defense Lines; The United States Does Not Give Up Supporting the Netherlands' Position; The Dutch Side Admits That the Captured Indonesian Leaders Have Not Regained Their Freedom</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] Countries opposed to colonialism pressed the United States on the 11th to support their motion to have the United Nations order Dutch troops to withdraw from the territory they have occupied in the Indonesian Republic. Australia, the Philippines, and India believe that only decisive action by the United States can force the Netherlands to back down and resolve the Dutch-Indonesian dispute peacefully. The Security Council convened an afternoon meeting to resume debate on the Indonesian issue, but U.S. officials declined to say whether they would take steps against the Netherlands. However, they revealed that U.S. Representative Jessup spent much of the 10th in Washington with U.S. Representative to the United Nations Commission for Good Offices Cochran, who had been recalled to the country. It is understood that Cochran believes that the Dutch military's Christmas Blitz has overturned the United Nations' peace efforts and is expected to support strong U.S. action to force Dutch troops to withdraw from the territory they have occupied in the past 20 days.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 11th] It is reported that U.S. Representative to the United Nations Jessup received instructions from the State Department on the 10th not to propose any strong measures against the Dutch military action in Indonesia.</p>

<p>[United Press, Batavia, 11th] Under pressure from the United Nations Commission for Good Offices, the Netherlands admitted on the 11th that it had not moved the captured Indonesian leaders to Bangka Island as previously announced.

The truth only came to light after the Commission for Good Offices formally requested to visit the captured Indonesian leaders.</p>

He said that U.S. lend-lease ordnance has been used by the Netherlands as weapons to reconquer the Indonesian people, which is a far cry from the Atlantic Charter and the "We respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live" proclaimed in the Tehran Declaration. Hurley said that he himself and former British Foreign Secretary Eden drafted the Tehran Declaration.

<h3>Various Agencies Decide to Publicly Announce that Grain Ration Prices Will Be Adjusted at Any Time; The Purpose Is to Prevent Famine and Ensure Rice Revenue for Continued Operations</h3>
<p>The American Economic Cooperation Administration's U.S. Aid Utilization Committee recently announced a new method for setting the prices of rationed grain. According to this method, the prices of rationed rice and flour in major cities may be adjusted within the month. The procedure is to review the rationed rice price every two days or every two weeks. If the difference with the open market price is too large, a new price must be set. The above method was decided after a long period of discussion by the agencies involved. Participants in the meeting included the Economic Coordination Committee of the Executive Yuan, the Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee, the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee of the Executive Yuan, and the American Economic Cooperation Administration, which has long advocated the adoption of this new method. The implementation of the above-mentioned new method aims to ensure rice revenue for continued food purchases and maintenance of the rationing system. If the prices cannot be adjusted at any time, the government subsidies will increase, and it will not be able to continue purchasing food domestically or abroad to maintain the rationing system. The result will be food shortages in the cities. Under the current rationing plan, the Chinese government is responsible for purchasing 60% of the food required for rationing, and the remaining amount is supplied by the American Economic Cooperation Administration. In the future, the adjustment of food prices in each rationed city must be decided after careful consultation and deliberation by the Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee, the Economic Coordination Committee of the Executive Yuan, the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, and the Economic Cooperation Administration. This decision must also be fully reviewed and discussed with representatives of the People's Congress of each city, as well as the local food department, the U.S. Aid Committee, and the Economic Cooperation Administration. The actual reasons for implementing the new pricing method are summarized as follows: (1) If the ration price is too low, the urban people will enjoy undue benefits compared to the general people who have to pay the open market price. (2) If the ration price is very low, farmers will not be willing to sell rice to the city. This situation may cause food shortages, as happened in some rationed cities last fall.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned new method has already been implemented in other rationed cities such as Guangzhou, Qingdao, and Shantou.</p>
<h3>November Priority Rice Certificates: Deadline for Submitting Rosters for Cancellation</h3>

The funds were expected to be allocated within the week. As for the coal briquettes, the Adjustment Committee had repeatedly requested the Ministry to allocate funds.</p>
<h3>Possible Reduction of Public Utility Burden</h3>

<h3>Western Films May Disappear Again: Employees of Eight Foreign Film Companies Go on Strike Over Treatment</h3>
<p>[Our Report] All Chinese employees of eight foreign film companies in the city recently began a full-scale strike because their demands to the management for adjustments to their treatment have not been met. The Shanghai Film Industry Workers Union also invited reporters to Kang Fan for this purpose. Song Weimin, the executive director of the Union, and Fang Zemin, the representative of the Chinese employees of the foreign film companies, reported on the process, stating that the current treatment of Chinese employees by foreign film companies is extremely unreasonable. The salaries of foreign employees are calculated in US dollars, and each person can receive more than 50,000 yuan per month, while Chinese employees are paid in Gold Yuan, and their income is only one-sixtieth of that of foreign employees. Therefore, in November of last year, they jointly submitted four requests to the management: (1) Increase salaries by 100%. (2) Restore the monthly rice subsidy for each person. (3) The dismissal of Chinese employees must be handled in accordance with Chinese laws. (4) If the company intends to relocate, it should pay severance pay. After this request was submitted, the management never paid any attention to it. Subsequently, the Social Affairs Bureau stepped in to mediate, but the management requested to handle it themselves. Then, representatives of both labor and management negotiated once, and the management only agreed to increase the salaries of Chinese employees by 40%, while the labor side insisted on the original conditions, resulting in a stalemate. The Film Industry Workers Union stated that if the strike by Chinese employees of foreign film companies cannot be resolved reasonably in the near future, it may lead to two consequences: (1) New Western films that are expected to be released will not be able to be shown in the city in the short term. (2) All projection technicians belonging to the Workers Union will support their position and demand that all cinemas withdraw Western films currently being shown and replace them with domestic films.</p>

<h3>New Director of Statistics: Chu Fei Takes Office, Advocates Self-Compilation of Indices for Various Industries to Meet Travel and Emotional Needs, and Publishes "Creed" and "Goals" in Writing</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Chu Yifei, the new director of the Municipal Statistics Office, officially assumed office at 10:30 AM yesterday without holding an inauguration ceremony.

Chu also believes that in order to adapt to environmental needs, the compilation of welfare indices by various industries should be promoted. Because the percentage of wages in the production cost of various industries varies, if indices can be compiled according to the actual living needs of workers in various industries and salaries can be adjusted at any time according to the price increase of various products, it will be more reasonable for both labor and management.

<p>It is also reported that the Donghua Football Club has not participated in the league since last season because player Han Nibo assaulted referee Jiang Yincong, and the Football Committee punished Han with an indefinite suspension from the game. The football field has been quite deserted. This matter has been understood, and Han Nibo has written a letter to the Football Committee admitting his mistake and requesting the lifting of the ban. This matter will also be discussed at today's meeting and should be approved. In this way, the obstacle for Donghua to participate in football club competitions has been removed. Donghua players will have no problem participating in the inter-port trials and the future Mayor's Cup competition. The Shanghai football scene will be a new situation.</p>
<h3>### Division II Basketball League: Adopts World Games Competition Method</h3>
<p>The fourth Shanghai Basketball League is about to begin. A total of 24 qualified teams will participate in Division II, divided into four sections. The calculation method will largely refer to the basketball competition of the 14th World Games. The calculation method drafted by the Basketball Committee is summarized and published as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The 24 teams are divided into four sections of equal strength, with six teams in each section. Each section will first hold a single round-robin competition.</p>

<p>(3) After the single round-robin competition is completed, the ranking of each team will be determined by the total number of points.</p>
<p>(4) If the scores of the teams are equal, the total number of points scored (i.e., the total number of balls scored) between the teams with equal scores will be subtracted from the total number of points lost (i.e., the total number of balls lost), and then the ranking will be determined.</p>
<p>(5) The first and second place teams in each section (a total of eight teams) will hold an A-group knockout competition to produce the overall ranking from first to eighth place.

<h3>Authorities Sell Off Materials and Tighten Credit: Prices Fell Across the Board Yesterday; National Bank Notifies All Branches to Tighten Remittance Business</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Credit tightened in Shanghai yesterday, and the interest rate for overnight loans rose. The highest overnight rate was 100 yuan per 10 yuan, and the ordinary rate also reached 70 yuan per 10 yuan. Due to tight funds, banks rarely lent out, making it difficult for the market to circulate funds. Cash funds are even more scarce. Due to the tightening of credit, prices of various commodities in the market fell across the board. In order to reduce the concentration of floating capital, in addition to notifying all national banks to tighten remittance business, the National Bank has also recovered 120 million yuan of settlement funds for yarn and sugar, and will tighten credit in the near future to curb the wind. In addition, the Gold Management Bureau and the Police Bureau sent personnel to various markets yesterday morning to monitor price gouging.</p>
<p>The Bank of China yesterday announced the remittance limits for various regions across the country as follows: (1) Limited to 100 yuan: Zunyi, Anshun, Duyun, Kaiyuan, Xiaguan. (2) Limited to 500 yuan: Yichang, Weinan, Nanzheng, Sanyuan, and various remittance branches in Guangdong Province. (3) Limited to 1,000 yuan: Danyang, Yangzhou, Anqing, Wenzhou. Also reported: Credit tightened and prices generally declined in recent days. According to the负责人 of the Gold Management Bureau, Shanghai has always been a speculative market, resulting in rapid price increases and decreases. This time, the skyrocketing prices were unreasonable. As soon as the government took special measures, the market changed suddenly. From now on, legitimate businessmen must not follow the trend and get caught up in the whirlpool. It is also learned that due to the tightening of credit in recent days, the black market interest rate has risen sharply, as high as one yuan. Industry and commerce have been greatly threatened. The production loans organized by the Central Bank's discount loan meeting will be reviewed more leniently due to changes in the financial market, so that various manufacturers can overcome difficulties and maintain production.</p>
<p>Since prices have been rising for days, all parties felt a lack of orders. Yesterday, credit was unusually tight, and the black market interest rate jumped from 70 yuan to 100 yuan. Cash funds were scarce due to outflow, and the needs of various industries were high, so the panic was even greater. The situation of bounced checks from banks has increased significantly due to the tight funds of all parties. The commodity market experienced a sharp drop in prices yesterday morning. In the afternoon, remittances from other ports continued to arrive in Shanghai, and supply and demand tended to balance. Lending slightly eased, and off-exchange prices also rebounded. Yesterday, the Central Bank lowered the price of gold for spot exchange by 500 yuan to 6,500 yuan, with an additional 8,500 yuan for spot exchange fees. The black market price of gold notes also softened. In the afternoon, the black market trading of gold gradually revolved upstream due to the spot settlement the next day. Compared with the market on the previous day, it was a large rise with a small setback. In addition, the prices of yarn and cloth fell across the board. Cigarettes, daily necessities, and Western medicines all fell by 20-30%. The securities market started spot settlement the next day yesterday, and the market showed a sluggish state. Yong yarn once fell to 16,500 yuan, and then rebounded to 19,000 yuan. Taiwan sugar continued to decline due to the further reduction of the Taiwan exchange rate. The off-exchange rate was 600 yuan, and there was still absorption.</p>
<h3>### Central Trust Bureau to Sell Large Quantities of Woolen Fabrics and Yarn Today</h3>
<p>According to sources from the Central Trust Bureau, the agency selling government materials, responsible to the government's Material Committee, has decided to continue selling large quantities of woolen fabrics and yarn starting today to cooperate with the authorities' policy of tightening credit in order to achieve the goal of stabilizing the market. It is said that the committee has a large number of materials available for sale, and the value of the woolen fabrics and yarn prepared for sale this time is more than 100 million yuan.</p>
<h3>### China Textile Mass Sales: Yesterday's Yarn and Cloth Market Declined</h3>
<p>China Textile sold a large amount of cloth yesterday to cooperate with the government's measures to tighten credit. Yesterday, a total of 10 types of cloth were offered for sale, selling 22,630 bolts of cloth and 6,900 pounds of remnant cloth, totaling 37,198,700 yuan. The assessed prices were: Dragon Head Cloth B 12-pound fine cloth 1,700 yuan, Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge 1,600 yuan, B 6000, 40 yards, 10-pound gray cloth 1,850 yuan, Deputy Brand 296, 1/2 yard, Serge gray 1,200 yuan, B 30-pound Zhigong呢 gray 1,300 yuan, US Painting Gang 1019 printed serge 1,850 yuan, Second-grade printed serge 1,750 yuan, Jumping Carp Yuan Guang Twill 1,230 yuan, Jumping Carp Gray Guang Twill 1,220 yuan, Rainbow Guang Jing Yuan yarn Zhigong satin 1,700 yuan. In addition, 17 pieces of 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix yarn were sold on behalf of the US Aid Cotton Yarn Association, each piece for 76,300 yuan, totaling 12,971,000 yuan. In addition, 72 pieces of 20-count Jin Shuang Hui were sold on behalf of the Bank of China for 43,000 yuan, totaling 3,096,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The yarn market was generally tightening, and the outside market was also blocked. People were disoriented, short sellers were active, long sellers were unable to pull up prices, and sales were continuous. All yarns went downstream. At the beginning of the morning, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was sold by colleagues, and customers also sold out. The selling pressure was fierce, opening at a low of 67,000 yuan. Later, there were still buyers absorbing at low prices, and the price reached a high of 80,000 yuan. The noon closing price was 78,500 yuan, a drop of 3,500 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell by 3,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon also fell by a small 3,000 yuan, ending at 63,000 yuan.

One-day arbitrage started at 4,000 yuan, peaked at 5,000 yuan, and finally closed at 4,500 yuan. Each grade of 20-count only fell by 1,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan, and each grade below 16-count fell within 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth fell across the board. It was rumored that the authorities continued to sell off materials to tighten funds, so credit in the market was generally tightened, and goods outside the market were also forced to fall. Many customers sold off their remaining balances because remittances could not arrive in time, and many colleagues closed out. Dye factories rarely entered or exited, and the market fell in a straight line. Dragon Head fine cloth fell from 1,900 yuan to 1,810 yuan. The closing price fell again to 1,700 yuan. Actual transactions were not many. Trumpet Boy fine cloth opened at a high of 1,770 yuan in the morning, but no one bought it until the closing price, but there were also few sales. Five Fortune fine cloth still lacked supply. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge opened at 1,770 yuan and then fell all the way to 1,600 yuan, a drop of 380 yuan from the previous day. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong fell by 340 yuan, ending at 1,740 yuan. Although the remaining cloth factory prices opened small, they were only about 200 yuan lower than before because the prices of fuel, pigments, etc. were all skyrocketing.</p>
<h3>### Gold Management Bureau Launches Third Inspection</h3>
<p>The Gold Management Bureau conducted two inspections of various banks in the city last month. The purpose was to understand the movement of floating capital and the situation of deposit and lending business. A third inspection is being carried out this week. It is understood that the purpose of this inspection is to find out whether there are any malpractices in the various banks and whether they have violated the provisions of the Banking Law. It can be completed next week. Once discovered, severe punishment will be given.</p>
<h3>### Yesterday, a Total of Forty Applications from Banks for Use of Funds Were Approved</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the application from banks to use the cash deposited for increased capital, the Municipal Gold Management Bureau has reached an agreement with the Central Bank that the bureau will submit the bank application forms one by one for review every Tuesday and Friday, according to the method for banks to use the increased capital. The first review meeting was held yesterday, and a total of 49 application forms were submitted. In addition to 9 cases that were returned due to non-compliance with procedures, 40 cases were approved, allowing the use of approximately 2 million yuan of increased capital cash.</p>
<h3>### Tight Credit and Product Reports: Rice, Flour, and Oil Prices All Fell</h3>
<p>The rice market turned down because credit was tight and owners were eager to sell. In addition, prices in Wuxi were reported to be sluggish, and people's hearts were even more empty. The early market was the most sluggish, and prices fell by 200-300 yuan. Subsequently, the rice shops absorbed at low prices, and then rebounded by 100 yuan, resulting in a drop of 150-200 yuan. However, the closing price was very sluggish. The closing price of white glutinous rice was 1,300 yuan, which was 150 yuan lower than the previous day. Early rice fell by 200 yuan, with a closing price of 1,250 yuan. White yuan and yin yuan each fell by 200 yuan. The prices of rice in the northern market generally fell by 150 yuan.

Large bags of bran fell by 34-35 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>All were small, because the closing price on the previous day was already down. Yesterday, credit was still tight, and rice prices also fell, so they continued to fall. However, the closing price of soybeans was slightly higher because the price of oil fell less. Broad beans did not open. Car beans were 830 yuan, which was 150 yuan lower than the previous day. The price of corn was high and thought to be dangerous, so owners frequently sold, falling rapidly by 250-300 yuan. Red grains also fell by more than 200 yuan, green beans fell by 200 yuan, and selected green fell by more than 100 yuan. Sesame seeds generally fell by 300 yuan.

Bean cake first fell and then slightly rose, a drop of 20-30 yuan.</p>
<h3>### Tea Prices Continue to Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market, although the credit of colleagues was tight and various goods outside the market plummeted, the goods party still increased sharply due to the steep increase in public utilities and the continuous stepping of the replication cost. In addition, the tea stock was as thin as spring ice, so the attitude became more defensive, and the asking price continued to soar, so the trend showed a special show, and the market was still like a runaway wild horse, advancing rapidly again. However, there were still not many buyers, so only a few transactions were made.</p>
<h3>### Foreign Exchange Certificates Fell Back and Overseas Remittances Remained Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank again entrusted the Bank of China to sell a large number of foreign exchange transfer certificates, causing the market price to fall sharply.

<h3>### Chamber of Commerce Telephonically Urges Yuan Ministry to Promulgate Supplementary Methods for Capital Conversion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, urging the prompt approval and announcement of the methods for changing the registration of the gold yuan conversion of the capital amount of profit-making enterprises. The original telegram stated: The esteemed Nanjing Executive Yuan Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Since the promulgation of the revised methods for issuing gold yuan coupons, the original methods for changing the registration of the gold yuan conversion of the capital amount of profit-making enterprises have become inapplicable. The esteemed Yuan (Ministry), for the sake of expedience, has drafted 11 supplementary articles. Our association was kindly shown a draft by the esteemed Secretary Deng of the Commercial Department of the esteemed Yuan (Ministry), and after briefly expressing our views, we presented them to the esteemed Yuan (Ministry) for adoption. However, the applications for changing the registration are all related to the supplementary methods. If the supplementary methods are delayed by one day, the preparations for industrial and commercial capital change registration will also have no basis, and they can only wait quietly. The determination of the rights and obligations of shareholders is inevitably at a loss, and the calculation of the future registration deadline is also affected. The current 37th year is the time for industrial and commercial final accounts, which is an appropriate opportunity for capital conversion and property valuation. We respectfully request the esteemed Yuan (Ministry) to promptly approve and announce the implementation, which is truly for the public benefit.</p>

<h3>Sweating Your Own Sweat, Eating Your Own Rice: Ningxia Supports Rural Revitalization by Equally Distributing Land So Tillers Own Their Fields and Rationally Utilizing Funds to Adjust the Rural Economy</h3>
<p>[Our Ningxia Dispatch, Eighth Day] Ningxia is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Its northern, southern, and central areas consist of plains and flatlands with interconnected fields and crisscrossing canals. The land is fertile, making it suitable for planting rice and wheat, and its products were once known to be abundant. However, the region is vast, and the population is sparse, resulting in extensive barrenness and underutilization of land resources, which is deeply regrettable! As early as the 22nd year (of the Republic), the province established the Provincial Land Reclamation Bureau to plan land affairs, pioneering land administration in the country. In the 25th year, the Provincial Land Administration Bureau was established, completing the surveying and measuring of land in the plains and flatlands in a year and a half. After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the authorities focused on increasing grain production and maintained the lowest grain prices in the country. In terms of land affairs promotion, from the 26th year to the present, a total of 500,000 mu of land has been released, with considerable results. However, according to the authorities' statistics for the 35th year, there are more than 2.3 million mu of cultivable wasteland in the province, and farm households with less than 10 mu of cultivated land account for 45.71% of all farm households. Those with less than 3 mu account for 33.33%. It can be said that 79% of existing farm households do not have enough cultivated land, resulting in a surplus of labor. (According to statistics, the average household in Ningxia has about seven people, and the minimum cultivated area per person is estimated at five mu, so it should be 35 mu to maintain the minimum livelihood of a household.) The occurrence of this phenomenon is due to the deterioration of the land system since the late Qing Dynasty, with people seeking loopholes and officials engaging in corruption, leading to the concealment of land, uneven tax burdens, and increasingly serious abandonment and desertion. After the 22nd year, when politics were on track and people's lives were slightly stabilized, the phenomenon of excessive abandonment of cultivated land and reduced production area still exists today. As for the utilization of land, it is even more extensive. People are lazy by nature, and cultivation has seen little improvement. Although there is water conservancy from the Yellow River, it has not yet achieved the purpose of utilization.</p>
<p>Legal Lending Method</p>
<p>All military, political, and financial institutions engaged in deposit and lending business in the province are prohibited from lending public funds or capital to merchants at low interest rates, allowing them to re-lend at high interest rates and exploit the blood and sweat of farmers. The Provincial Bank should formulate measures, modeled after cooperative lending methods, to lend all funds to farm households engaged in cultivation through cooperatives. Violating institutions will be reported and punished. Merchants and public educators who privately engage in usury and exploit farmers will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Appeal from the Authorities</p>
<p>Although Ningxia has a small population, if everyone works for their own livelihood, no one will starve or freeze. Only those who seek gain without labor, are idle and dissolute, or have bad habits are social parasites. The provincial government stipulates that after reaching the age of compulsory labor service, people should automatically participate in various production activities. Those with bad habits or unemployed vagrants should be made to reform. Otherwise, village chiefs can send them to the county government for custody and sincere training or organize them into labor teams to participate in public cultivation. The government also stipulates that every farmer must raise at least one head of cattle or mule to strengthen their cultivation ability. These livestock cannot be regarded as property and freely sold or mortgaged. In addition, the government encourages people to contract pastures to raise livestock. Private cattle and horses can be distributed and used by the government in a unified manner, but payment will be made at market prices. If there is a shortage of labor or land abandonment in rural areas, the government will organize public farms and use machinery or military power to cultivate.</p>
<p>The authorities have made the following appeal to the farmers: Production is the foundation of supporting people. If everyone is to have food, everyone must first have work. As the saying goes, "Sweat your own sweat and eat your own rice." With equal land distribution, rational use of funds, and farmers' dedication to work, the rural economy cannot but be revitalized.</p>
<p>Tillers Own Their Fields</p>
<p>Now, the authorities, considering that the foundation of military affairs should still be sought in politics, regard improving people's lives and stabilizing social order as the primary goals. In other words, it is necessary to implement equal land rights to solve the land problem and enable tillers to own their fields; to regulate capital and be able to use funds well to revitalize the rural economy; and to advocate diligence and thrift, increase production, and enrich the people through labor education. The aim is to seek the prosperity of the entire society in a spirit of peace and mutual assistance, eliminate class struggle, eliminate inequality between rich and poor, so that everyone has work and food, and then the bandits will be quelled and eliminated on their own. A new China of prosperity, strength, health, and happiness can be expected to be realized soon.</p>
<p>Implementing New Plans</p>
<p>In order to realize the above aspirations, the Ningxia Provincial Government has recently promulgated and implemented a land reform plan to support rural work, with detailed regulations on the distribution, utilization, and development of land, funds, and labor. To effectively and thoroughly implement this plan, a group of workers has been trained to form rural support work teams, which are going to various counties to conduct detailed surveys and statistics on land, population, labor, and the current status of the rural economy. At the same time, rural work committees have been established in each county and township to jointly promote the realization of this aspiration.</p>
<p>The basic spirit of this work plan has been described above. Now, let's report on some of the individual key points:</p>
<p>New Estimates of Farmland</p>
<p>According to the latest estimates of the Ningxia Provincial Government, there are no less than 600,000 mu of cultivable raw and ripe land in the province. It is also planned to build a large canal along the Helan Mountains in the near future, which will increase the amount of wasteland by 3 million mu. Building a large canal along the Niutou Mountains can increase the amount of farmland by 500,000 mu. If scientific cultivation is used to increase labor and capital, making the land yield two harvests per year, it will be equivalent to having nearly 30 million mu of farmland in the province, which will be sufficient to distribute to the province's 700,000 people. However, the provincial government believes that there are more disadvantages than advantages to distributing land according to the number of people, so it stipulates that each household will be the unit, with 40 mu for one to five people, 80 mu for five to ten people, and an additional 4 mu for each additional person above ten. In this way, the existing social structure will not be destroyed, and population growth can be encouraged. The excess part of the existing land can be contracted by tenant farmers, renters, and hired laborers, who have priority to contract from landlords after the plan is announced. If no one contracts, demobilized soldiers and military families with cultivation ability have the second priority. The payment for the contracted land is based on rice and wheat as the standard, and the contractors will pay it off in fifteen years (but those who wish to pay it off in one lump sum or voluntarily shorten the period are allowed). Land prices are divided into three grades: the highest price for Grade A is two shi and one dou of the market, one shi and five dou for Grade B, and one shi and five sheng for Grade C; the highest amount of land price paid each year shall not exceed one shi and four sheng.</p>
<p>Land Acquired</p>
<p>Attachments to the excess land, such as houses and trees, can be levied or purchased incidentally. However, it is rigidly stipulated that the land acquired under this plan must be self-cultivated and not rented out. Without approval, it must not be arbitrarily abandoned, divided, or transferred.</p>
<p>If farmland has fragmented plots that are not suitable for economical cultivation, the government will expand them into collective farms to replace labor with mechanized cultivation. As for the remaining land to be distributed (including public land), in addition to retaining a portion for farmers who need land to continue to apply for, it will all be designated as public farms, mobilizing local labor for public cultivation or handing it over to the military for land reclamation.</p>
<p>Use of Funds</p>
<p>In terms of the use of funds, the focus is on cracking down on usury and revitalizing the rural economy, so that capital can be well used in rural production to enrich people's lives. To achieve this goal, the first step is to improve the relationship between lenders and borrowers. The government will bear the guarantee responsibility for loans to rural investment and increase the interest rate to 2% to 2.5% in silver coins. When private loans are contracted, it must be noted that "interest is calculated annually." If interest is calculated monthly or compound interest is charged, it will be considered usury, which the government will absolutely strictly prohibit. Village heads will guarantee loans or use agricultural products as collateral, but it is not allowed to agree on low prices for rice and wheat in advance. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Agricultural Lending Institutions</p>
<p>The plan also stipulates that in the future, agricultural lending institutions should closely connect with land administration agencies and cooperative organizations in their business and re-plan. For farmers who contract cultivated land, loans should be concentrated for the needs of acquiring land or purchasing cattle and tools. The procedures should be simplified as much as possible, and the amount should be sufficient for use, so that it is in line with the land reform policy. Loans are not allowed to be given to other farmers who do not contract land in accordance with this plan; moreover, the families of soldiers fighting in the suppression of bandits have priority for such agricultural loans, and the government guarantees them. In addition, regardless of public or private loans, it is not allowed to mortgage or sell land, cattle, mules, agricultural tools, etc., which are necessary for agricultural production, to pay off debts.</p>
<h3>End of the Gold Rush: Ma Hongkui Oversteps His Authority</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Peng Lin</p>
<p>[Our Ningxia Dispatch, Fourth Day] The Ningxia gold deposit and exchange craze has been investigated by the military law office. A total of 131 taels, 1 mace, 4 fen, and 5 li of gold have been found. The depositors are Cheng Jiapeng, manager of the Central Bank, and his family members and staff, totaling thirteen people, who deposited 14 taels, 5 qian, and 4 li. Wang Xiling and six other staff members of the Bank of Communications deposited 20 taels, 4 fen, and 4 li. Niu Yinzhou, manager of the Farmers Bank, and his staff and family members, totaling eight people, deposited 6 taels, 9 qian, 7 fen, and 6 li. Han Hongyuan and eleven other staff members and family members of the Commercial Bank deposited 11 taels, 8 qian, 6 fen, and 5 li. Twenty-six merchants from other provinces deposited a total of 63 taels, 4 qian, and 2 fen, and 5 li. Nine officials from the military and political circles, such as Ma Junru, deposited a total of 14 taels, 3 qian, 3 fen, and 1 li. Although there are indeed eight people such as Li Zichang, they firmly claimed that they did not deposit or exchange. In addition, forty-four people are either using aliases or have no address, so they cannot be traced. Therefore, the remaining 58 taels of gold have been secretly purchased by those with power and wealth using aliases. The people of this province and general low-paid public educators were unable to deposit and exchange their shares.</p>
<p>According to Ma Hongkui himself, when the first batch of gold arrived in Ningxia, Cheng Jiapeng, the manager of the Central Bank, asked Zhao Xudong, the chief of the General Affairs Department, to inquire with Ma about whether he was willing to purchase the gold. Ma sternly refused. When the gold was not publicly deposited and exchanged and was exhausted, the people were full of resentment, and public opinion in the province was in an uproar. Measures were then taken to order the military law office to thoroughly investigate the surnames of the gold depositors. The case is now nearing its end. Chairman Ma Hongkui issued a public notice to all sectors, explaining the difficulties of the investigation and that it was all out of concern for the people and that he had no intention of "overstepping his authority." His public notice stated: "If this chairman thoroughly investigates, the whole case will definitely be clarified... But looking at the overall situation, the situation in North China is urgent, and the bloody battle on the Huai River is in full swing. This bank (referring to the Ningxia branch of the Central Bank) is not affiliated with this government, and this matter is not related to the overall situation. I really do not want to bother the President with a small matter in a corner. However, the enormity of the evil forces in society and the selfishness of financial personnel can be seen from this. This chairman has exhausted all methods and used all his strength for this unfair matter, but unfortunately, the world is not what it used to be, and people's hearts are sinking. There are many who are greedy for money and profit, and few who are eager for public service and justice. Although I want to uphold justice and distinguish right from wrong, I am obstructed by evil forces, which has led to the failure to thoroughly investigate the whole case and the failure to benefit the people. This chairman feels that his virtue is thin and his ability is weak, and he is unable to control the public. He is unable to live up to the heavy trust of the central government, and he is unable to comfort the eager expectations of the elders. When I think about it at midnight, I cannot sleep peacefully! However, I have fulfilled my responsibilities and made my intentions clear, and the elders of all sectors should be able to understand."</p>

<h3>New Year's Talk on Hangzhou: The Issue of Building a Cultural City Re-raised</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, Ninth Day] In the New Year of 1949, playwright Xiong Fuxi, sculptor Liu Kaiqu and Qiu Yao, a teacher at the Shanghai Municipal Experimental Drama School, came to Hangzhou together. Mr. Liu said as soon as he saw me, "I sympathize with your continuous efforts in the Shen Bao to build a cultural city in Hangzhou!" He was a professor at the National West Lake Art College before the war and has been away from Hangzhou for twenty years. He said, "Hangzhou is indeed an ideal cultural city. There is no other way for Hangzhou except to build a cultural city."</p>
<p>Including the reporter, we exchanged opinions with writer Sun Fuxi, who flatly sympathized with my proposition. We also went to find painter Ni Yide, and went to Jingci Temple, Tiger Spring, Jade Emperor Mountain, Longjing Temple, and Longjing Village to play. Every time we went to a place, concrete designs that should be present in the construction of a cultural city floated up.</p>
<p>Extensive Cultural Activities—Jade Emperor Mountain Will Not Be Isolated</p>
<p>We feel that although many scenic spots and historical sites, such as Jade Emperor Mountain, have undergone constant artificial reorganization, their contribution to the entire society is still small. It is nothing more than flaunting the style of the elite to the wealthy and leisurely, without real, realistic, and great value, because it has not been refined by culture. Therefore, we feel that it is close to vulgarity, and even not as good as the simple and original sentiments contained in Longjing Temple and Longjing Village. Mr. Yide said: It is also inappropriate for Jade Emperor Mountain to become an art college, because the new realism is to be close to the people and close to reality. I said: The words still have to be said over and over again. If there are many shuttle buses that can cheaply send people to Jade Emperor Mountain, and when the people get adequate rest, and there are extensive cultural activities on Jade Emperor Mountain, then Jade Emperor Mountain will not be too "isolated." In our conversation, it can be said that we discussed everything from top to bottom, past and present, China and foreign countries. From Picasso's paintings to several modern Chinese painters, from the architecture of Italy and France to the architecture in China's Hangzhou scenic area. Everything about music, drama, etc. was discussed.</p>
<p>Open the Door to Welcome Cultural People—Expand Institutions in Quality and Quantity</p>
<p>We have talked about the fact that general literary and artistic workers are often limited by the environment and cannot develop the environment and overcome the environment, which affects their works and their future. Therefore, we cannot only be satisfied with the reality of Hangzhou, and we cannot only build it in reality, but we should have a more distant and brighter ideal.</p>
<p>Of course, if Hangzhou is to be built into a cultural city, it should first allow cultural people to cultivate and operate on this land. First of all, Hangzhou itself should open its doors to welcome them, thereby expanding and improving cultural institutions in terms of both quality and quantity, so that they have work to do and things to ask for, so as to give full play to their talents.</p>
<p>Expand the Foundation of the Art Exhibition—Art Museum Should Be Established</p>
<p>As it stands now, the National West Lake Art College should expand its foundation. The current art college is mostly painting, with very little sculpture added. It cannot be called a complete art college. It is necessary to make the West Lake Art College have departments of fine arts, music, sculpture, drama, dance, and architecture, so that the art college becomes a central institution that specializes in studying the theoretical systems and life practices of various arts.</p>
<p>In addition to the art college, it is best to establish an art museum. If a new art museum can be built, it would be best; otherwise, it can be discussed with the Education Association on Yingshi Street to rent the Education Association and transform it. This art museum is the center of artistic activities. It can be used as a base to launch various artistic activities and cooperate closely with the art college for academic research, and strive to carry out various activities according to each season.</p>
<p>If the foundation of the art college can be expanded and an art museum can be added, it will be able to accommodate a larger number of cultural people, thereby enabling Hangzhou Cultural City to obtain the embryo of a prototype. Of course, this also requires magazines for pure literature and art, newspapers that are excellent and specialized in spreading cultural seeds, and various publications related to cultural undertakings.</p>
<p>The Authorities Should Formulate an Overall Plan for Beautifying Hangzhou</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Government must adopt the opinions of cultural people to beautify the metropolis of Hangzhou. At the same time, the construction of buildings in the city, where to build what type of houses is appropriate, such as building Chinese-style and antique-style houses near the lake, building Western-style houses in residential areas, and building tall Western-style buildings in commercial areas, etc., should all be pre-planned with a certain format and an overall plan. The planting of what kind of trees in what places, such as planting willows along the lake and planting fruit trees in the mountains, etc., should also have appropriate arrangements.</p>
<p>Some people think that in this era of frequent wars, what is there to talk about art and culture? Everyone knows that only art and culture can eliminate war and make people universally nourished by art and culture, so that they can live actively, upward, and progressively. Precisely because there are frequent wars today, we should more urgently call for the construction of a cultural city.</p>
<p>We once heard Chairman Chen Gongqia say that he would set up a cultural center, which is a good idea. However, culture includes a very wide range: Therefore, I hope that the cultural center can be changed to an art museum and urgently realized. We had a chat with Mayor Ren Xianqun, and he also sympathized with the construction of Hangzhou as a cultural city. However, sympathy is not enough. He should focus on cultural construction in future construction and hope to have a concrete plan and promote its realization one by one.</p>
<p>Mr. Ni Yide told reporters: "Regarding your proposition to build Hangzhou as a cultural city, I sympathize with you and support you. The establishment of the West Lake Art Research Institute can be said to be a de facto voice of support!"</p>
<p>Several of us have agreed: In the future, our actions will surely strive to realize the ideal of building Hangzhou as this cultural city!</p>
<h3>New After Viewing of Yi Ethnic Group</h3>
<p>[Our Ya'an Dispatch, January 6] Since the Yi ethnic group's sightseeing tour of Nanjing, Shanghai and other places returned, all the members of the group have had an extremely good impact on Yi affairs: (1) After returning home, each member of the group publicized the process and feelings of this trip, as well as the photos, paintings, and weapons given to them by the heads of state, departments, and ministries, along with the recorded phonograph records from Shanghai, to their relatives and friends, and went deep into the Yi nests in the Greater Liang Mountains to promote and explain the government's intentions, and describe the progress of human evolution. These Yi people were deeply moved and their thinking changed as a result, and their hearts turned towards civilization. Recently, Luo Daying, Luo Zhenjiang, Luo Benjia, Guoji Mada and other members of the group led dozens of Yi chieftains such as Luo Hongchang from Woli, Bazhe, Guabie, Puxiong and other places who had never been to Xichang before, and they all went to Xichang automatically to express their absolute support for the government and stabilize the border areas. (2) The Yi people recognize that the Han and Yi are one family, and there is no longer any distinction between them. They also realize that if they want to make the Yi people progress, they should start with culture and education. They organized a branch of the Yi Ethnic Cultural Association in Xichang. Sun Fang and Wang Jimin were elected as the heads and deputy heads. A craze for setting up schools has now been set off in the vast Yi area. The chieftains of the Yi people in various places recently gathered in Xichang and asked the government to guide and assist them in running border people's education. It has been decided to divide the four places of Bazhe, Puxiong, Beishan, and Ningdong in the Yi area into education areas to prepare for the establishment of a total of eighteen border people's primary schools, and to appoint special personnel to be responsible for the preparation. They are scheduled to open in the coming spring, and all existing school buildings have been built. They also asked the government to develop transportation and were willing to contribute to the construction, so that the culture and economy of the Yi people would develop and create a prosperous area.</p>

<h3>A New Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains: Chengwudu Highway Now Open</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 7th] A visitor from Wudu said: Construction on the Chengwudu Highway began in March of last year, employing over three hundred civilian laborers daily. After more than nine months, the entire route is now fully open and unobstructed. The most difficult engineering feat was the Hongjiwan section near Wudu. This area, originally named "Hongtuwan" (Red Earth Bay), has historically been a dangerous cliffside path. The number of people who disappeared while traveling through this area is countless, making it a perilous route for travelers. During the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty), the path was renovated and renamed "Hongjiwan," with an inscription carved in stone alongside the road, signifying a blessing for safe passage. However, the natural hazards remained. During the surveying of the Chengwudu Highway last year, it was widely believed that the project was too difficult to complete. However, Ding, the commissioner in the eighth district of Gansu province and concurrently the director of the engineering bureau, was determined to overcome nature with the spirit of "moving mountains." A portion of the cliff, approximately two hundred thousand cubic meters, was cut away from the mountain peak. The road was finally completed. The Hongjiwan, historically regarded as a treacherous area, has been transformed into a safe and smooth thoroughfare.</p>

<h3>Silk Market Initially Weak, Then Stabilized</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for human silk was unusually tight, with businesses facing difficulties in cash flow. Shadow interest rates soared as high as one thousand yuan for overnight loans, with rates ranging from one hundred and thirty yuan, leaving many overleveraged. Sales flooded the market, leading to sluggish conditions. The 120 Guangtian Bridge new goods opened at a low price of 73,000 yuan in the morning. There was strong selling pressure, and buyers were hesitant. In a matter of moments, the asking price dropped by another three thousand yuan, causing the market to weaken further. After a long period of consolidation, the tight credit conditions eased, and shadow interest rates dropped by thirty to fifty yuan. Buying interest returned to the market, and short covering occurred from yesterday's positions. External speculative funds also exerted pressure, leading to a shift from fear to stability. The market recovered by two thousand yuan at closing, with arbitrage pushing it up by seven thousand yuan. In the afternoon, external factors stabilized slightly, boosting confidence and improving market sentiment. Asking prices rose again. Guangtian Bridge was quoted at 84,000 yuan and 85,000 yuan for forward dates, and Dongyang was quoted at 85,000 yuan and 86,000 yuan, representing an increase of 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The market price of raw silk foreign exchange transfer certificates continued to decline slightly, and human silk and satin also weakened. Businesses similarly faced tight credit conditions, with a lack of orders. Many traders were still struggling to sell after the opening, but ultimately succumbed to the pressure of high interest rates, causing the market to soften. Billion-grade separate-handled spot goods opened at 84,000 yuan and 85,000 yuan in the morning, but the overall trend was weak. Negative external factors led to aggressive selling in the market, causing prices to fall by four to five thousand yuan. In the afternoon, human silk recovered, credit conditions eased, and the market stabilized slightly, with asking prices rising by two thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the satin market was hampered by tight credit, resulting in sluggish trading. Businesses were fearful, and external factors declined across the board. Local buyers were inactive, while speculative traders rushed to sell, weakening the market. Meiya opened at 43,500 yuan, but the trend continued downward, nearing the 40,000 yuan mark. The market then stagnated, with trading coming to a standstill. Near the close, buying interest stirred slightly, leading to a slight recovery, ultimately closing at 41,500 yuan. Asking prices rose again by one thousand yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Market Remains Strong Throughout the Process</h3>
<p>The tung oil market opened yesterday with tight credit conditions in the market, leading to a general decline in prices of goods outside the circle. Additionally, tung oil prices had been rising excessively in recent days, leading traders to become wary of high prices and gradually seek to sell, causing the market to weaken and decline sharply. The market closed with a consensus drop of one hundred to three hundred yuan. However, green oil continued to be absorbed by paint shops in this area, and exports also rebounded, resulting in particularly strong demand throughout the supply chain, giving it a leading position.</p>
<h3>Should Promote Wild Mountain Tea</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhu Xianggao</p>
<p>Our Correspondent</p>
<p>[Yixing Dispatch, 9th] Yixing was never considered a tea-producing area, but after the sales of pottery teapots at home and abroad, tea planting gradually drew attention and became a major side business. During the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, a variety called "Da Hong Pao" (Big Red Robe) was produced, which was the most prized tea. Imperial officials came to Yixing to purchase tea specifically for the emperor. That's when Yixing gained fame and sparked interest in planting tea among the general public. As a result, production surged, and Yixing became a famous tea-producing area in Jiangsu Province, controlling a large share of the market in both northern and southern China. However, instead of developing, it has been declining. To investigate the root cause, this is not just a problem within some rural areas. Looking back, it may also be the reason why Chinese tea was eliminated from the foreign exchange market by teas from India, Ceylon, and other countries. How to revitalize the industry is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>Distribution of Tea Producing Areas</p>
<p>Tea farmers can only utilize mountainous areas with relatively poor soil for planting, so the available mountainous land is scarce. Mountain farmers are mostly restricted to limited flat mountains. Therefore, the formal tea-producing areas are only Zhangzhu, Huwen, and the Baihechang in the southern suburbs, totaling around 100 mu. Every year, the tea can be picked in March, May, and July, respectively, as "Yuqian" (before the rain), "Mingqian" (before the Qingming Festival), and "Chunhong" (spring red) teas. After the three teas are harvested, most tea farmers prepare to bind grass for the winter. However, some poor households still pick a fourth tea during the year, which is called "Guodongqing" (overwintering green). However, the picked tea is rough and the growth in the coming spring will be significantly damaged. Many tea farmers who cannot afford to overwinter resort to this self-destructive method. Their picking methods are outdated and follow the branches, resulting in mostly rough tea stalks. Additionally, the selling price is sometimes lower than the cost of production, which hinders quality improvement. This has led to the current decline. Nowadays, Yixing tea is only sold in Beijing, Shanghai, and north of the Yangtze River because its quality has not been improved, resulting in shoddy products. It has been demoted from the prestigious living room to a cheap beverage in hotels, bathrooms, and teahouses, and is being eliminated by tea from Zhejiang and Anhui. According to pre-war statistics, about 300,000 dan were sold annually. Today, North Jiangsu is a war zone, exports have been severely hit, and it cannot compete with Shanghai and Hangzhou. Without seeking progress, how can it avoid decline? However, the good news is that a ray of hope has emerged, like a promising virgin land has been discovered.</p>
<p>Sparse Production of Tea Trees</p>
<p>On seven random occasions, woodcutters discovered a few vibrant camellia plants in the deep mountains. They picked the flowers, brewed them, and found that they had a unique taste. Tea farmers considered it a miracle and opened up a new path for the county's tea industry. There has been no expert study on this quality, and everyone simply calls it "Wild Mountain Tea." As the name suggests, it is buried between deep mountains and wilderness, and it requires patient people to discover it. Due to its scarcity, although it has been around for nearly a hundred years, it is still rarely seen in the market and enjoyed by the general public. It has not been promoted, like an undiscovered treasure. Perhaps it is because the soil naturally suits the nature of tea planting. The extraordinary novelty of wild mountain tea has no other explanation for study. The reporter visited a wealthy tea farmer who owned more than ten mu of mountainous land and went with him to visit his tea plantation. On a not-so-high flat mountain, a piece of flat land was filled with tea trees of varying heights, lush and green, with no gaps in sight. Some of them even cultivated whole plots of land between the rows of trees, planting taro and soybeans because the production of tea trees was low, and they had no choice but to plant other miscellaneous grains to supplement their income. There were hardly any wild mountain tea trees that he transplanted from afar. They looked particularly small, and he carefully picked a small amount of tea for us to brew and drink at his house. It was indeed well-deserved. The taste, color, and aroma became more mellow over time. Compared with Qimen and Longjing teas, it was like the calligraphy of Li and Yan, forming its own style. Even after four infusions of boiling water, it was still green and fresh, which was by no means comparable to the products sold in the market.</p>
<p>Maojian (Downy Tip) Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Among wild mountain teas, Maojian is the best. Even after careful roasting, a layer of fine hair remains on the leaves. "Wild Mountain Maojian" is the best of the best, and is distinguished by this feature. Although it has been transplanted by ordinary tea farmers, it has not attracted the attention and investment of the Beijing and Shanghai markets due to its scarce production and high labor costs. There is concern that transplantation would be unprofitable. Therefore, it has not yet gained recognition. Ordinary tea farmers have failed to improve the soil quality and production, and they have no interest in transplanting. Every year, in late autumn, large tea farmers go to seek and collect tea once. According to the Tea Industry Association, only a few dan have been shipped out of the mountains this year, and all have been collected and treasured by local gentry tea drinkers who know the goods in the city, preparing to savor them slowly. Although there is a very small amount of tea for sale in the market, most of it is imitation, deceiving laymen.</p>
<p>Adding Color to Tea</p>
<p>Recently, several major tea merchants, yearning for the heyday of tea production in the past, initiated the organization of the Yixing Tea Production and Marketing Cooperative. In addition to improving production, the central work is to transplant wild mountain tea in large quantities and study soil cultivation techniques. Although the technical methods cannot compete with the tea market abroad, according to the reporter's observation, it will definitely be a strong competitor to teas from Zhejiang and Anhui. They have already begun to implement this plan on New Year's Day. They are willing to bear the painful and expensive costs of reclamation, strive to avoid exploitation by middlemen, call on major tea farmers to be the basic cooperative members, guide all tea farmers in the county to improve varieties, and strive to cultivate large quantities of wild mountain tea. The plan is to increase production by ten thousand ancestors of family tea and five hundred thousand dan in the first year, sell it themselves, open up new markets, and step from decline back to prosperity.</p>
