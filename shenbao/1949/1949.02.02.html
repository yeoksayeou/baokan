<p>〔本報浦鎭一日電〕津浦南段國軍主力仍固守滁河南岸，北岸東葛。西葛方面亦仍由前衛部隊胡長淸部駐守，原駐烏衣之共軍江淮獨立旅，昨自動北撤，刻烏衣鎭已成眞空狀態。又，國軍楊幹才部已調京外圍某地休整待命。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江一日鴛〕據官方消息：儀徵城迄未失守，縣長左治人仍率所屬保警團隊協同國軍及海軍艦艇艱苦堅守縣城待援，雖曆七賽夜，官兵士氣極旺。左縣長幷電告省方：「決堅守儀徵非奉命令誓不輕棄守土之責」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕江南國軍已按預定計劃完成新部署，京各機關疏散工作亦大致完成，故原為軍運及疏散公敎人員所需大量車皮多已歸還建制，京滬路行車秩序因此已漸復常態。此間雖地近戰區，但以衛戍總部之繼續嚴格執行戒嚴令，情况仍安謐如恒。李代總統為加强首都治安，一日上午十時並召集軍憲連長以上警局所長以上官佐，在國防部訓話，張耀明·張鎭·黃珍吾·趙霞等均出席。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京一日電〕李代總統直屬廣西部隊一日代蔣總統之中央部隊，接防浦口浦鎭區。廣西軍第十三兵團，並由張淦將軍統領，業於卅一日開始開入浦口浦鎭區，替代李延年將軍之第六兵團，第六兵團共計有第廿八·五十九·九十六軍三軍，現被奉命駐長江南岸。第十三兵團共計三軍，約六萬人，但迄今抵防綫者約二三萬人。此次調動被認為表示率代總統有在任何情形下保衛南京之決心。前傳張淦並同時內定為首都衛戍司令。據國軍軍界人士稱，共軍似已放棄直接進攻浦口—浦鎭及南京之計劃。在於浦鎭以北之共軍二縱隊已開始北退，大約向東赴運河區。一般認為共軍此舉更可證實所傳共軍初步企圖，擬在儀徵或鎮江附近地段渡江之說，該處江面較狹，且有數處小渚。據鎭江來人談，政府軍沿江完成部署，準備對付共軍之渡江，砲隊已在江岸附近。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口一日電〕鄂西·鄂北·鄂東情勢平穩，流竄荊門當陽附近之土共已被國軍驅散，刻鄂境尚無大接觸。又，國軍勁旅開抵信陽增援。刻正在該城以北明港以南戒備中。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口一日電〕交通界息：平漢路信（陽）漢（口）間班車仍續行駛，電訊亦照常通達，粵漢路南下旅客略增，秩序尚稱良好，京漢航運無阻，招商局明日可能有一商輪離漢駛京，惟民生公司船隻多已暫停東下，參加西上航運，刻漢宜間小輪來往均頗便利。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕李代總統日前來滬邀請此間社會名流顏惠慶·章士劍·冷禦秋·陳光甫·江庸等五人，以私人資格，前往北平與中共方面代表接洽和談事宜後，昨日此事尚無重大發展，故行期亦未定。惟顏惠慶於昨日下午五時，柬邀章·冷·陳·江四人，在其寓邸茶叙，約一小時始散。記者前往訪問顏氏時，渠等正共進炒麵。</p>
<p>顏氏談話</p>
<p>旋顏氏出見記者，以祥和之口脗稱：「目前並無新聞，外間對我們種種的傳說，並非事實。今天五人會面，因為過去很少接觸，借此機會聚聚，並無特殊問題討論，一切仍須等待南京命令。至目前為止，我們一切都無準備，例如走時須要飛機，也得南京準備。以我個人而言，活了七十三歲，還未乘過飛機，而平素向患心臟病，平時總住在樓下，怕爬樓梯氣喘，所以是否適於坐飛機，大成問題。但想到平生受了國家許多優惠，這次是為國家社會和人民而奔走，就是抱病在身，也是義不容辭的，大不了我請了醫生跟我走。」</p>
<p>關於與中共接洽和談之計劃，顏氏稱：「目前對此也談不到，不知南京要我們幾時走，到北平究竟和中共方面那幾位接洽也不得而知。此去也不敢說有權代表那一方面，或有權請中共指派代表，地點和時間，進行全面和談。但至少此行數人，都是社會上稍有地位的人士，說出去的話，也許多少有人要聽一些，所以決定以私人的資格，向中共說明人民對和平的希望，同時將儘量訴說目前人民所受的痛苦。」顏氏最後結語稱：「目前和談之門已開，但願此行能使此門開得更大此。」</p>
<p>章氏談話</p>
<p>又據章士釗表示：五人此行，純屬私人對和平試探性質，對整個和談大計，當有待政府代表邵力子。張治中·黃紹竑·鍾天心等全權接洽。</p>
<p>又外傳五人中，以冷禦秋對和談表示最為積極。惟據冷氏昨語記者：此次純係李代總統推定，渠本人是否將前往北平，刻尚未作量後決定，故對和談意見，無從談起。</p>

<p>〔本報南京一日電〕內蒙德王一日下午一時半乘軍機離京飛陝轉蘭，隨行者有蒙籍人士及卷屬十餘人。德王應蔣總統之邀，來京近月，與京中各方多有接觸，然殊少發表政見。記者一日在機塲曾詢渠對蒙古出路的看法，渠率直答謂「自決」。此一最後草地蒙胞愛戴之老人，其民族意識終不因其個人家庭之遭難而稍受影響。據悉，德王將以西北為基地，繼續其拯救蒙胞之工作。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據水利部長鎭天心（按鍾為政府推派與中共接洽和談五代表之一）昨日談稱：政府和談代表邵力子·張治中·黃紹竑等，將來可能在滬啓程，前往指定地點，與中共代表洽商和談。惟此事仍須視上海各界名流顏惠慶等五人之行結果如何，方有端倪。行政院自決定遷穗後，下次政務會議，卽將在穗召開。渠本人亦定一二日內飛穗。又據中央社訊：鍾天心一日吿記者：政府和談代表團秘書部門人員現均集中上海，對未來和談之準備工作，諸如過去政協各項資料之搜集整理，政府歷年來簽訂國際條約之蒐集等，均已積極進行，代表團原擬隨帶電台，惟如和談地點設在北平，電台自無需隨往。總之，代表團內部各項事務大致已摒擋就緒，現僅等待中共之答復矣。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕外傳邵力子日前來滬後曾擬就和談方案一說，昨日業經此間權威人士否認。</p>

<p>〔中央社蘭州一日電〕西北軍政長官張治中將軍今下午抵蘭後接見記者，答覆詢問，茲誌如下：（一）問：共黨堅持懲治戰犯，和平是否已經絕望？答：沒有，現在還說不上「絕望」的話。（二）問：西北前途如何？是否可能局部和談？答：西北是中國的西北，我是中央政府所派的和談代表我願為全面和平而努力。（三）問：長官對於和平觀感如何？答：全國人民要和平，政府也要和平，是政府和人民的意志已完全一致，卽在中共方面似亦不能說不要和平，不過在兩黨二十多年鬥爭之下，一且講和，自然免不了爭執與波折，但政府為表示爭取眞正和平的誠意，一切應該先求其在我，不過要鎭靜些，從容等待着。（四）問：長官對國際情勢怎樣看法？答：國際局勢已趨向協調，從國際協調的趨勢來看，中國前途也可樂觀的。（五）西北軍政局面有變動否？答：沒有。（六）問：新疆目前情况如何？答：新疆和平統一民主團結局面正在不斷的進展中。</p>

<h3 id="c8">甘介侯談　和平有望 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕李代總統私人代表甘介侯敎授，一日對往訪之記者談稱：和平是可能的，蓋自中共提出和談之八條件後，刻政府方面亦同意根據此八條件，進行和談。而李代總統之私人代表，曾在北平與中共方面迭有非正式之接觸，經過亦頗圓滿，故根據此種跡象觀之，和平確屬有望。甘氏並稱：目前政府對和平之努力，殊為熱誠，故亦希望中共同表熱誠。渠不明中共何以能不熟誠，蓋過去之二十餘年間，中共亦一向高喊需要和平。</p>
<p>至此有記者問，和談期間，設中共實行渡江，是否對和平為不熱誠之表示，甘氏答曰：然。惟渠旋卽引出某軍事觀察家對渡江之看法，認為照目前情勢，共軍在二個月內，將無法完成渡江。因黃河以南長江以北地區之共軍，經長時期及多次之戰爭後，實力並不堅强。林彪之軍隊，則因華北方面傳作義將軍仍握有廿萬人馬，一時無法南下，卽使南下，渡江仍須有三四週之準備，以便調集大批軍火舟車强渡，而渡江主力，至少須卅萬人馬，惟江南國軍人數及配備均有相當數量，果能堅守，中共實不易渡江。渠旋舉一歷史明證，略謂，五十年前，孫傳芳率領數倍之人馬，過江侵襲南京，而是時李代總統僅以一軍之兵力，致孫軍於死命，以今例昔，如江南守軍立志堅守，歷史不難重演。</p>
<p>關於遷都問題，甘氏認為無論和平是否有望，政府不得不採取應變之措施，故政府決定遷往廣州。惟渠個人看法，認為此時政府遷都，仍慷太早，渠並保證李代總統決不離京，且可能永留南京。其他政府各部會首長，此後視職務需要，當需來往京。滬。穗間。故卽使政院遷穗，而李代總統仍留南京，依總統為政府之代表而言，當亦可謂政府仍在南京。</p>
<h3 id="c9">并垣週邊共軍　又將發動攻勢　軍事負責人指出種種跡象 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社社太原一日電〕幷垣週邊共軍可能在週內發數第七次攻勢。此為此間軍事負責人今對記者宜稱者。該負實人指出共軍可能發動攻勢之種種跡象稱：共軍自上年十二月初第六次攻勢慘敗後，卽將濟南俘獲士兵及普中各縣民兵調集幷垣周圍，撥補其死傷殆盡之殘部，經一閱月來整訓，刻已竣事，且其攻擊工事業經構築完成，各區共軍日來有顯著增加，且調動及運輸頻繁，並向各縣徵集大批祖架梯材，且放還若干俘虜官兵，佈置內應，發動謠言攻勢，再證之共軍屢以砲擊試探，其發動攻勢之徵候益趨顯明。渠繼稱，共軍雖利用當前和談形勢，對太原發動猛烈攻勢，以助其政治陰謀，但敢斷言吾人有必勝把握，共軍來犯必遭較前六次更慘重之失敗。</p>
<h3 id="c10">平聯合機構成立　共軍保安隊續開入城內 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平一日電〕北平聯合辦事處今日正式成立，一般人均關切談機構今後之動態。主任委員葉劍英及其他三代表聞已入城，正待視事。各公團忙於籌備慶祝，報紙已改稱共軍為「人民解放軍」，以前之國軍則稱為「國民黨匪軍」。能俄文者已在門口張貼招生布吿，開辦俄文專修班·華北日報登有出售「俄文新文法」廣吿。電訊檢查已經取消，將來是否恢復，未可逆料。傳作義之剿匪總司令部已解散，若干報紙已開始稱傅先生。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平一日電〕今日又有共軍保安隊五千名開入城內，今日為年初四，商店尚未開市，新年氣象仍濃，紫禁城與東交民巷機塲等均已歸共方接管，政府軍源源出城，學生繼續遊行與集會歡迎共軍。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平一日電〕截至今日午後五時為止，此間共軍當局尚未規定人民銀行鈔票對金圓券之兌換率，黑市價格為一對十三。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平一日電〕共軍昨日入城後，卽接收河北省政府及其他黨政機關，如中央通訊社北平分社，北平廣播電台，國民黨主辦之華北日報等，天主教主辦之「益世報」則已自動停刊。傅作義司令部人員已裁减至僅剩十分之一，辦公處搬至西部日本人所築之新北平區，聞傅氏本人亦在該處。共軍昨日入城未生事端。一入城卽在各機關門外站崗，北平聯合辦事處設東交民巷前日本大使館，共方代表亦下榻該處。街頭時見共軍成羣結隊歌唱，好奇羣衆圍觀歡呼·共軍與政府軍甚為親睦，在聯合辦事處前站崗之共軍與前政府軍並無惡感，雙方招呼前均互相行敬禮。薄暮時，學生一批在街頭游行，手執歡迎共軍旗幟，並抬着毛澤東朱德之巨幅肖像，所喊口號中有「打倒不平等條約」。據可靠方面稱，入城共軍人數計兩個縱隊約二萬人。北平警備司令部之指揮權已移交共軍，同時共軍軍官在傳作義司令部與前政府軍軍官會晤。共軍之入城突如其來，故一般人尤其是學生均感驚訝·外國記者數人，擬拍攝共軍入城照片，但被共軍方面政治工作人員阻止。獄裝政府軍仍在多處交叉路口站崗，遮斷交通，讓共軍隊伍通過。政府公務員一批分乘卡車數輛，奉派至西直門歡迎共軍，並呼「人民軍萬歲」等口號，但一部份似稍露窘態。政府方面某影片公司得共軍許可拍攝共軍入城影片·另有卡車一輛載共方宣傳人員，隨時拍照。共軍偶有全副軍裝的女兵，更受大注意。</p>

<p>亞洲大局在動盪中，而美國速東政策愈益舉棋不定了。際此動盪不定之會，美政府派遣了陸軍部長羅雅爾將軍和魏德邁將軍赴日訪問麥克阿瑟元帥。據東京消息說：羅雅爾一行約於二月一日抵達東京，麥帥正準備熱烈歡迎，並將與之討論日本情形。據華盛頓消息說；羅雅爾一行訪日的任務，顯然由於共產黨在中國節節前進，美國的亞洲戰略局勢受了重大影響，將由彼等與麥帥共同檢討之。根據上述報道和一般形勢來說，美國政府方面，至少是陸軍部方面，深感亞洲的野火已經燃近眉睫，美國實有重新檢討或另行建立新政策之必要。羅雅爾魏德邁為美陸軍部要員，杜魯門總統的亞洲戰略計劃人，他們此次訪日，當是一樁值得重視的事。</p>
<p>美國的對外政策，一向就有重歐輕亞的傾向。這一種輕重的偏差，在戰後的馬歇爾計劃實施的時期中，表現非常露骨，並且事實上已經造成若干的錯誤！馬歇爾計劃的重歐輕亞，二年來的事實說明並未能拯救歐洲，更未能復興歐洲，相反的，却失了亞洲，坐視亞洲的共產主義從無根之地生長起來，蔓延開來，中國北部的形勢和北韓的擴張，以及最近日本總選舉中共產黨的相當勝利，都說明美國以往的遠東政策有了顯著的失敗，美國整個亞洲戰略形勢也因而受了很大的改變和影響。國務院最近人事的調整，對於美國對亞政策固然並無修改，但是陸軍部的焦灼情緒，僉認整個亞洲戰略局勢實有重新檢討的必要，雖然這種檢討已感為時過遲，但如果眞能迎頭趕上，依然是有補於未來世界大局的。</p>
<p>今後美國的對亞政策，祇有三條路可循：（一）是靜觀共產黨在中國的繼續前進，甚且不惜撤退南韓，以確保日本，稽極扶植日本；（二）是對蘇協調，重新決定戰略上的讓步，輿蘇聯維持亞洲的新均勢；（三）是有條件的扶助中國政府，加强對華的援助，以遏阻共產主義的發展。美國陸軍部要員的意見，比較偏重第三點，而麥帥的意見則或將趨向第一點，據聞最近麥帥向美政府提供建議書一件，即是支持第一點意見的。實則只是確保日本而放棄了中國，退出了中國，必不能挽回亞洲之危運，此點魏德邁將軍知之甚明。此次羅雅爾魏德邁兩將軍的訪日，除了重新檢討亞洲局勢及日本情形以外，可能協商一項共同的意見，以為今後美國對亞政策的準繩，而此項共同意見，必首與中國大局有關。所以說羅麥等這次的晤談，其決定與結果，關係遠東局勢是很重大的，特別是與今後中國局勢的發展，有着很大決定性的。</p>
<p>扶植日本，似乎是美國旣定的政策，而扶植日本的心理因素，多半是輕視中國現局勢，其對於整個亞洲政策是無補的。麥克阿瑟元帥執行此一政策，他固然要堅持此一政策，但他過去也說，倘中國局勢更趨惡化，顯然將使美國在日本的地位為之削弱，所以屢屢主張積極援華。加以魏德邁將軍為中國之友人，熟習中國情勢，渠與羅爾雅將軍似乎正欲與麥帥謀取一種協調妥協，即如何在不妨礙扶植日本的旣定政策下，從速加强對華的援助，藉以遏阻共產主義在中國乃至在亞洲的節節前進。如果此一決定獲得結果，今後亞洲局勢可能逐漸改觀，至少現在猶豫不定的態度將不復存在，無論如何，對於中國現局警的演變，是有利益的。</p>
<p>同時，美國新國會對外經合委員會主席麥克倫氏聲稱：美國在亞洲採取反共立塲一如在歐洲之所為，這是時候了。他並且明白主張，建議貸款十五億援華，包括軍事援助與經濟援助。從這裏，也可看出美國對於中國大局發展的焦灼心理。我們早就說過，中國政府以前之抵抗共產主義，乃為中國而同時為世界，美國不能採取「觀望」政策或「退出」政策的。中國政府也該明白：向中共求和應有限度的，和則可而降則不可。因為舉中國全國而屈降於共產主義之下，決不是中國人民所甘心的。惟其如此，我們於羅雅爾魏德邁兩將軍之訪問東亞，十分重視；在亞洲大局動盪中，十分重視美國對亞政策的轉變，尤其是對中國政策的轉變。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅一日電〕美國對於史達林新的和平表示，墊須從長計議，始行作答。今日聞有一種意見正在考慮中，其內容卽為利用此一和會，將蘇聯戰後與西方國家之交涉史，作一總檢討，然後重新要求莫斯科破題兒提供實據，證明此次行動確係出於誠意。白宮新聞秘書羅斯吿記者稱，杜魯門總統仍維持其以前發表之聲明，卽隨時準備在華盛頓候晤史達林，目前則暫無意見發表。另據此間官員私下談稱，美國現有一新國會，國務卿艾契遜亦係新人，杜魯門總統新任期適肇始，在此全新面目之下，史達林有此新姿態，自當特別小心，闡明美政府對蘇熊度，以免觸犯國會及其他方面之和平情緒。亦有人懷疑史達林適於此時有此表示，其作用仍在宣傳，非欲探測美國對於東西雙方棄嫌修好之態度者。</p>

<p>綠有二七五次疏散專車載運總統府人員南撤，列車係由頭等車二輛，二等車二輛，鐵蓬車二輛，混合組成，當由南京總站開行時，曾與總統府洽妥，該列車中之頭二等車四輛，不能過軌南駛，抵滬後必須掉換三等車廂。前日下午該列車抵本市北點後，路局卽請掉換三等車廂，與總統府人員接洽，當時含糊答應，但請路局將此車妥加保藏，以免遭其他單位佔用。路局以為此問題已吿解決，不料至昨晨十時許，突來一百餘人，由一朱秘書率領，包圍調度所與配車所，堅欲將頭二等車原車過軌，路局以頭二等車絕對不能過軌南駛，一言不合，立卽發生衝突，配車所主任陸星明首當其衝，被毆受傷，調度所玻璃，電話，調度板均被損毀。後經軍運辦公處，路局運務處等各單位聞訊趕到勸解，始吿解決。總統府人員允照原議將頭二等車掉換三等，該列車亦已於昨晚離滬南駛。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕「太平」「建元」兩輸互撞慘劇發生後，上海方面被難乘客家屬組成之善後會積極辦理登記事宜，截至昨晚止，前往登記者已達八百餘人。同時一部份家屬代表於昨午援赴市府謁見吳市長，請求當局卽督促兩公司辦理善後。另部份家屬代表則隨「海川」輪赴口外勘察，該輪於昨下午一時抵達杭州灣東，北緯卅一·三二度，東經一二二·二八度，距滬約七十浬之半洋山島，當卽在附近進行搜索。各代表並乘金萬隆機帆船，由船主胡志隆引導登島尋覓，惟風平浪靜，迄晚仍毫無所見。該輪將留駐海上，今日繼續搜索，冀對太平及建元兩輪沉沒之地點，先加以正確測定。</p>
<p>關於兩輪之失事地點，據江海關海務科公吿，謂建元沉沒於白節山及半洋山之間，太平則沉沒於白節山燈塔之東南方約四浬半附近。至招商局方面於兩輪出事後翌日，曾應益祥·中聯兩公司之請，派出民三〇五號輪一艘，赴舟山羣島一帶搜索，據其事後返滬提出之報吿稱：「廿八日下午八時抵大戢山因天黑無法工作，乃決定停泊，廿九日晨五時啓航抵白節門，七時餘卽嗚汽笛，無動靜，嗣改航佛蘭克林礁，沿途每隔五分鐘作信號一次，其時風平浪靜，且適值退潮時期，僅見燃油飄浮水面。後遙見白節門中有小舢舨，乃折回探問，據該舢舨上漁夫謂：渠等曾於廿七日晚間，在陸上見一輸船沉於白節門水道中，當時有救生舢舨放下，小孩女人之啼哭聲音，亦可聞及，並見燈光甚亮，時受退潮影響，各舢舨無法搶至白節門登陸處等云。繼又出航巴來島，下三星燈山，佛蘭克林礁等各島間，為尋人及浮物起見，除隨時注視外，並施放氣笛，惟仍一無動靜。在白節門外二三浬之距離及佛蘭克林礁附近，有船用燃油浮於水面，間或可見　酒瓶箱。嗣在回程潮水吿漲，白節門水道亦可見油跡·當往返各處航行視察時，曾見海關有景星艇在半洋山與白節山之間下錨互通消息結果，得悉渠等亦為探測沉船位置。至上午十時，所有應航視察範團內均已工作完畢，回航返滬途中，在大戢山附近曾遙見一艙口板浮於水面。」該報吿中測定之沉船位置與海關公吿者稍異，惟根據其巡航經過觀察，沉船可能係在白節山及半洋山附近，此一問題現正由有關各方詳細研訂中。</p>

<p>陳布雷死後二三事  鈞摩　　〔本報南京一日快訊〕陳布雷氏於去年十一月十三日在南京逝世以後，遺體已於十二月十日卜葬於杭州九溪十八澗徐村以北，梵村茶亭勞的小山上。那裏省山面江，風景靜　。杭州太是陳氏生前數度舊遊之地，除了故鄉慈谿而外，杭州也許是他平生最喜愛的地方。他早年求學於杭州，中年又曾担任浙省敎育廳長頗久，因為愛杭州山水的淸新秀麗，所以與友人合購了六畝山地，就是今日卜葬的所在。當時意思，原想在年老力衰時擺脫政務，退居林下，在這裏蓋幾間簡單的平房，讀書作文，以度餘年。想不到國家如此多難，這個希望始終未能得償，但當初買的這幾畝地，作為住家確實並不十分合適，因為與市區相距過遠，交通殊不方便，但作為　地，則無論是內行的堪與家或是普通的過路客，都感覺這是一塊好地方。因為它高亢爽朗，背後山嶺起伏，而前面一望無際，錢江如帶，蜿蜓脚下，氣勢的確是雄偉中帶有嫵媚。墳墓工程，經治喪委員會工務股加緊建造，已經大體竣事，只餘墓碑墓表等尚未鐫刻。墓碑將由錢太希作書，依照陳氏生前的淡泊志願，只刻「陳布雷先生之墓」，而不列任何官衛之名。專表則由陳芷町撰作，不日卽將完成。從此，這一代精神上的完人，就長眠於此，使湖山勝蹟中，又多了一重供人憶念憑弔的所在。　　陳氏遺族，現在正整理陳氏的日記，文稿，　札，遺墨等，準備絡續付梓。已經出版的，有陳氏生前所自撰的「回憶錄」。這是一本編年體的自傳，自出生至五十歲（民國二十八年）時止。至於五十歲後至死前的十年，因為尚未寫入回情録，只好有待日記來作為補充了。這本回憶錄，其中所記有其家庭各事，求學經過，獻身新聞事業和其後從政的種種記叙，其中有許多事情是外間所從未知道的，這對於研究現代史的人，當然不失為一種重要文獻，而研究陳氏的性格為人，這也是最直接可靠的資料。書由廿世紀出版社發行，全部用影寫版精印，以求保存眞蹟。　　「回憶錄」後，日記和文稿亦已整理有緒，書札則因為　輯不易，短期內尚難出版。陳氏每天記日記，多少年來從未間斷。他因有嚴電的失眠症，每夜非服安眠藥不能入睡，而每晚所服的藥量，亦都記之於日記之中。所以這些日記裏，有政治潮汐的起伏，有事業人生的了悟，有身邊瑣事的記叙，一俟整理有成，卽可付刊，至於交稿，北伐軍掃蕩南北之際，「畏壘」的文字眞可謂婦孺皆知，一文之出，萬人傳誦。他在天鐸報，商報，時事新報等所寫的評論，都已剪貼成册。陣氏生前，曾利用餘暇，把這些文章自已選輯過一遍，現在將以他所自已選出的一些文章彙輯出版。如此，他的文字，將與他的為人一樣，在世間水垂不朽了，　　香港一部分新聞界人士，為了紀念這位新聞界的老鬥士，並謀發展華南和南洋的新聞事業，培養國外新聞人材，特發起在香港創設「布公新聞學院」，芷在積極籌備中，不日卽將招生開學。陳氏故鄉慈谿中學的校舍，是去年由陳氏發起募款籌建的，也已經在元旦落成。　　陳氏死後，總統曾明令褒揚，說他「履道之貞，謀國之忠，持躬之敬，臨財之康，足為人倫坊表。」但在新聞界，是感覺失去了一位和藹可親，誨人不倦的長者，在人民，則是喪失了一位眞肯自已含辛茹苦，而為人民夙夜憂勸的公僕。他的事蹟，宣付國史館。國史陳布雷傳，已由鄞縣名古文家沙孟海（文若）氏撰擬，其內容茲照錄如下：　　陳布雷，原名訓恩，字彥及，浙江慈谿人，陳氏昆弟用文學顯名，從兄　懷，工詩古文，終浙江臨時參議會議長，自有傳。布雷年十四，應府試，知府喻兆蕃特賞異之，拔置第一。明年，補縣學生，尋畢業浙江高等學堂，為文初師同縣楊敏曾馮卉，繼泛覽中西名法家言，獨擅政論，淸宣統三年，與吳興戴傳緊以少年掌天鐸報論評，名聲動一時。武昌倡義，上海諸報猶未敢公言　命，布雷首撰談鄂十篇張之。民國十年，為商報總主筆。當國民黨改組，國民革命軍北伐前後，商報非黨辦，發於正義，造論料彈北洋諸帥，響應國民革命，正江左之視聽，筆墨廓淸之功，幾與兵戎埒。最後為時事新報總主筆。日本寇濟南，布雷立揭膺懲暴日之義，旣而曰：國未統一，對外宣戰可乎？乃更其辭，勉國人忍辱負重，完成統一。後政府密頒宣傳方鍼，與布雷議悉合。今總統蔣公北伐次南昌，卽要布雷入國民黨，浙江底定，以為省政府秘書長，轉國民黨中央執行委員會書記長，兩任浙江敎育廳長，一任敎育部常務次長，政務次長，兼中央宣傳部副部長。二十三年，始參蔣公幕府，為南昌行蒙設計委員會主任委員，改侍從室第二處主任。日本圖我亟，我政府陽與周旋，陰備戰甚力。布霄作「敵乎友乎」一首，明中國必不可屈服，日本不可不計東亞之安危，使日本彷徨無主之國論有所警惕，假他人姓名刊布之，日本報章競譯載焉。諸謀侵我者見而色沮，頗疑是文由我政府授意云。抗戰軍興，蔣公身總黨政軍電任，而久典樞要，得其專信，終始若一，相與以有成者，世推布雷第一人。布雷亦兢兢自怵厲，不伐功，不言祿，凡所關白，必本諸公忠，獻可去否，不擇小已利害為趨舍，蔣公數欲廣侍從室職黨，曰：某事某事，君兼辦之，布雷輒尼其議，曰：有主者，內外大吏有利病不能自請，必密與疏陳，不外聞，其有積不相能者，恒居間為調適，不入吿，出入公門，淵默少成否，似粥粥無所為，及其臨大節，抗言爭辯，曾不肯轉分寸，蔣公倚之若左右手，歲時會同，及有大興革，諸凡吿語友邦責讓敵國戒勵羣吏曉諭兵民之文移，無綫電傳播之講說，大氐出布雷手，蓋其文章論議，表　於外者，世所共見，至於運策帷幄，幹翼大計，成其事不居其名，則非外人所得而知也。布雷官侍從室最久，二十八年，兼國防最高委員會副秘書長。三十四年八月，日本降，九月，罷侍從室，專任國防會事，後遷國民政府委員，憲政行，改總統府國策顧問，代理中央政治委員會秘書長，體故贏，善病，敏於感物，而迅於見幾，旣委質入仕，無時不以民物國族為心，身處機近，所更非一，見吏習之日　，國常之就弛，銳欲起而頓之，自以幕職，非當路，雅不欲越人之權，則隱為彌縫匡救之計，去甚去泰，默運而潛移之，其濡忍之志，有非恒人所能堪者，。旣自知力之將素，卽幽思愁苦，忽忽無以紓解。三十七年十一月，家人以事之上海，布雷獨留京，從容作書上蔣公及與家人朋好訣，凡十二通，置枕上，已，吞安眠藥過量自盡，翌日日隅中，侍者遲之朱起，　戶入，始覺有變，就撫之，大氣旣絕矣，年五十九，其上蔣公書曰：今春以來，目覩耳聞，飽受刺激，入夏秋後，病象日增，神經極度衰弱，實已不堪勉强支持，值此黨國最艱危之時期，自騐近來身心，已無絲亳可以效侖之能力，與其偷生尸位，使公誤計，以為尚有一可供驅使之部下，因而貽誤公務，何如坦白承認自身已無能為役，而結束其亳無價值之一生。又曰：布雷此意，早動於數年之前，最近亦起於七八月之間，常誦餅之罄兮惟　之恥之句，抑抑不可終日。韓愈有言，中朝大官老於事，詎知感激徒拚婀，年迫裘暮，無補危時，自問良知，實覺戰時不應無感激輕生之士，而此身又非自效危難之身，長日回皇，慚惶無地，昔者公聞葉舉詆毀總理之言，而置箸不食，今我所聞所見於一般老百姓之中毒素宣傳以散播關於公之謠言誣衊者不知凡幾。回憶三十二年，公卽命注意敵人之反宣傳，四五年來，布雷實毫未盡力以挽回此惡毒之宣傳，卽此一端，已萬萬無可自恕自全之理，我心純潔質直，除忠於我公外，亳無其他私念，今乃以無塊自容之悔疚，出於此無可諒恕之結局，實出於心理狂鬱之萬不得已，敢再為公陳之。布雷之死，迹殊於靈均，而志絜行廉，泥而不滓，其傷心似之。蔣公聞訊自臨視，撫尸大慟，比殮殯，凡再詣奠，藵卹有加禮焉。遺著有畏壘室文存，回憶録。回憶録者，其自次年譜也。某軍事觀察家告記者　共軍能插翅渡江嗎　　〔本報鎭江卅日訊〕據此間某有力軍事觀察家語記者構：長江天塹，共軍渡江短期內絕不可能，京滬綫當可安謐如恒，希望人心安定，萬勿庸人自擾。繼稱：中國自古以來的戰爭史上，黃河長江都是兵家可以扼守的天險，而况政府有堅强的海軍和空軍，封鎖浩浩長江而有餘，反之，共軍旣無兵艦船隻又無飛機，插翅也難飛渡。　　渠又稱：假定共軍要大規模偷渡長江，又假定五十人乘一隻大民船，則至少要一千隻民船，而現在揚子江沿岸早經封鎖，那裏來這許多船？退一萬步說：卽就有一千隻船載大批共軍南渡，老天「西北風」帮忙，一夜飄過江，京滬一帶也有重軍砲兵嚴密防守，海空巡弋監視，共產黨又怎　冒這樣大的險來渡江送死嗎？所以我認為京滬可以篤定，江南可以萬無一失。一年來之英國經濟  本耿　　〔本報倫敦廿日航訊〕根據往年情形，英國政府大約在每年三月閒總要出版一本關於經濟情形的白皮書，一方面是檢討過去一年的情形，他方面也說明未來一年的計劃。那大約是觀察英國經濟現狀之最好的參考資料之一。目下此項白皮書尚未出版，若干經濟上之統計數字，亦未公布，本文所說明的，一方固然根據一般所能知遭者，但主要都是以英國財相克里浦斯（Siz　Stafford　Corippo）之最近談話為依據。　　全面平衡　尙未達到　　對外貿易是英國今日經濟問題的主體所在，去年十二月出口之臨時數字為一億四千五百七十萬英鎊，較之同年十一月减少一百四十萬英鎊，但十一月份之「工作日」較十二月多一天。如以每日平均出口量計算，則十二月份較十一月份多百分之三。十二月進出口之有形貿易，其逆差（卽入超）為二千六百五十萬英鎊，較之十一月减少二百二十萬英鎊，並且是一九四七年正月以來每月入超數之最低者。全年之出口及再出口之總數目，如以每月統計為基礎，其總數為十大億四千八百萬英鎊，入口為二十億又八千萬英鎊。如以上下兩個半年比較，則上半年之逆差為二億五千一百萬英鎊，而下半年則僅為一億八千一百萬英鎊。如就數量方面與以往者比較，一九四七年英國之出口量高於一九三八年者百分之九，一九四八年上半年之出口率，高於一九三八年者為百分之三十，到了下半年，則增高為百分之四十二。如以進出口貨之價値比較，一九三八年，出口價值約爲進口都百分之六十四，一九四七年約爲百分之七十二，一九四八年則爲百分之八十五至九十。很明顯的，　外貿易是在逐漸進步中。但是英國今日的目的，似乎是要做到所謂「全面平衡」（Overall　Bolance），這個「全面平衡」的意義，據解釋是一個國家的消費將不多於它所生產者。這種「平衡」必須出口足以支付進口，而英國今日則尚未能達到。　　不寧唯是，英國不但需要推動出口，幷且還需要向特定的國家出口，這些國家自然是包括英國進口貨之來源國家。最重要者為美國及加拿大，其次為阿根廷比利時與瑞士，都是所謂「硬幣」國家。但是自一九四七年年中以來，只有對加拿大的出口有所進步，而對比利時及瑞士兩國的出口，近數月來，且略有下降。這些國家，多半都沒有禁止進口，而在這些國家中，市塲之競爭甚為劇烈。英國對付這些國家的方法，除了向之出口之外，另一方法是原來向之購買者，現在改向其他非美元國家購買。一九四八年的入口，大約較之一九三八年的入口，在量的方面，减少了約五分之一。在這减少的數量中，食糧酒·及烟草，由原來佔入口總數百分之四十七减少到百分之四十一。反之，原料則由原來佔入口總數百分之二十七增加到百分之三十三。　　工人數字　略見增加　　想减少進口，推廣出口，必須增加生產。所有工業生產的指數，在去年十月間，高於一九四六年每月平均數者百分之二十七。「工作人口」之數字，則比較穩定，十月底之所有民事　工為一千九百二十萬人。換言之，工作人口受人口絕對數之限制，因此，在工作人口沒有多大變動之下，欲求增加生產，必須增加每一工人之個別生產量。去年有些重要工業的工人數字，略有增加。例如紡織工業增加了三萬五千人，但仍較預計中為少。煤鑛工人，預計增加三萬一一千人，但實際只增加六千人，幷且都是外國人。英國人雖然也有加入者，但其數目與離開者相似，這些表示增加人數之不易。　　各業生產　個別情形　　去年各業生產之個別情形，約略如下：車輛之生產情形甚好，客車在一九四八年中，如以首十一個月之生產量為準，則一年將有三十三萬五千輛，卽高於一九四七年者百分之十七，商用軍輛為十七萬輛，高於一九四七年者百分之十。船隻之完成者，一九四七年為九十五萬浄噸，一九四八年則超過一百二十萬浄噸。煤之出口目標，亦已達到，但出產量未能如預期者，是以動用庫存的煤一百五十萬噸至二百萬噸間。情報案兇犯　張際明解錫　　〔本報無錫一日電〕情殺案兇犯張際明，已在滬就擒，昨晚押解抵錫。　　〔又電〕城內田基浜十二號昨夜發生連刧五家鉅案，損失頗鉅，據悉：暴徒均身穿黃服。袖珍新聞　　桂林　　〔本報訊〕國立廣西大學校長陳劍翛貪污嫌案，業經該校各敎授等指控其四大罪狀：（一）侵吞汽油，以少報多‘（二）油桶舞弊。（三）偽造圖記發賣校車票。（四）浮報柴火，報銷時以少報多。兩廣監察行署桂林辦事處，現已將該校上年十一·十二兩月帳簿與出納記帳簿抽查，案情眞相不日可大白。　　吳興　　〔本報訊〕蘇北阜寗難民二百六十多人，携老扶幼，由鎭江來湖，至本縣西門向當局救濟，當由鎭公所給資，向鄰縣而去。嘉興縮影  本報記者陳劍雄　　嘉興—在這兵荒馬亂的時代中，它沒有被捲入烽火的漩渦裏，表面上看來，確是戰亂裏的一個樂園。但表面的繁榮，仍掩飾不了內在的空虛，它經過八年的浩刦，如今仍不能掙脫戰爭的間接影響。　　經濟的動盪，使公敎的待遇無一定標準，所領得的薪給，確使他們無法生活，因此小敎首先發動請願，當地各報亦為文呼籲，終於在參會九次大會上通過，解了生活鑒迫的重圍。　　參議負諸公對小敎的生活，確很關心，可是因為太關心而鬧出了一件笑話。當九次大會決定推派代表，向縣長要求在一週內淸發小敎的八至十一月份薪給尾數，果然縣長滿口答應，飭主管科漏夜趕造名册，通知各校具領，豈知每一敎員最多的尾薪僅十餘元，從鄉村到縣城往返的川資，却耗去了二三十元，若干鄉鎭因離縣較遠不及趕返，膳宿也發生了問題，大家弄得哭笑不得。　　公敎待遇之苦，却不如公敎的文化人之苦。當物價最高峯的時候，以一月薪給購買黑市「白錫包」香烟一包，尚感不敷。雖後經編輯記者聯誼會邀請各報負責人要求增加，較之公敎低於二倍之多。此後是否可能調整，希望還太渺茫。　　嘉興的治安工作，確實做到了確保安全的地步。近幾月來，不但盜刦案件沒有發生一件，連偷竊的小案子也很少發現。</p>

<p>[Our Puzhen Dispatch, 1st] The main force of the National Army on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway remains firmly defending the south bank of the Chuhe River. The Dongge and Xige areas on the north bank are also still garrisoned by the forward units of Hu Changqing's command. The Jianghuai Independent Brigade of the Communist army, originally stationed in Wuyi Town, withdrew northward voluntarily yesterday, and Wuyi Town has now become a vacuum. Furthermore, the National Army's Yang Gancai's unit has been transferred to a certain area outside of Nanjing for rest and reorganization, awaiting orders.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 1st] According to official sources: Yizheng city has not yet fallen. County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren is still leading his subordinate police teams, working with the National Army and naval vessels, to tenaciously defend the county seat while awaiting reinforcements. Although seven days and nights have passed, the morale of the officers and soldiers is extremely high. County Magistrate Zuo also telegraphed the provincial government: "I am determined to defend Yizheng and will never lightly abandon my responsibility for defending the territory without orders."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Army in Jiangnan has completed its new deployment according to the pre-determined plan. The evacuation work of various agencies in Nanjing has also been largely completed. Therefore, the large number of train cars originally needed for military transport and the evacuation of public employees and teachers have mostly been returned to the establishment. The traffic order on the Jinghu Railway has thus gradually returned to normal. Although this area is close to the war zone, the situation remains peaceful and stable as usual, due to the strict enforcement of martial law by the Garrison Headquarters. In order to strengthen the security of the capital, Acting President Li also convened officers above the rank of company commander in the military police and police chiefs above the rank of police station chief at the Ministry of National Defense at 10:00 AM on the 1st for a speech. Zhang Yaoming, Zhang Zhen, Huang Zhenwu, Zhao Xia and others were all present.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The Guangxi troops directly under Acting President Li replaced President Chiang's central troops on the 1st in taking over the defense of the Pukou and Puzhen areas. The 13th Army Corps of the Guangxi Army, commanded by General Zhang Gan, began to enter the Pukou and Puzhen areas on the 31st to replace the 6th Army Corps of General Li Yannian. The 6th Army Corps, consisting of the 28th, 59th, and 96th Armies, has now been ordered to be stationed on the south bank of the Yangtze River. The 13th Army Corps consists of three armies, approximately 60,000 men, but so far only about 20,000 to 30,000 men have arrived at the defense line. This transfer is seen as indicating Acting President Li's determination to defend Nanjing under any circumstances. It was previously rumored that Zhang Gan would also be simultaneously appointed as the Capital Garrison Commander. According to military sources in the National Army, the Communist army seems to have abandoned its plan to directly attack Pukou-Puzhen and Nanjing. The 2nd Column of the Communist army north of Puzhen has begun to retreat northward, heading eastward towards the Grand Canal area. It is generally believed that this move by the Communist army further confirms the rumored initial attempt of the Communist army to cross the Yangtze River in the area near Yizheng or Zhenjiang, where the river is narrower and there are several small islands. According to people from Zhenjiang, the government forces have completed their deployment along the river to prepare for the Communist army's crossing, and artillery units are near the riverbank.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 1st] The situation in western Hubei, northern Hubei, and eastern Hubei is stable. Local bandits who had infiltrated near Jingmen and Dangyang have been dispersed by the National Army. There are currently no major engagements in Hubei. Furthermore, elite troops of the National Army have arrived in Xinyang as reinforcements and are currently on alert north of the city and south of Minggang.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 1st] Sources in the transportation sector: The bus service between Xinyang and Hankou on the Pinghan Railway continues to operate, and telecommunications are also functioning as usual. The number of passengers traveling south on the Yuehan Railway has slightly increased, and the order is still considered good. Navigation on the Jinghan waterways is unimpeded. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company may have a merchant ship leaving Hankou for Nanjing tomorrow. However, most of the ships of the Minsheng Company have temporarily suspended their eastward voyages and are participating in westward shipping. Currently, the small ferries between Hankou and Yichang are quite convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Yan Huiqing and Four Other Representatives' Trip to Beiping Is Not Yet Scheduled; Exchanged Opinions at Yan's Residence Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Acting President Li recently came to Shanghai to invite five prominent figures in the Shanghai community – Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Leng Yuqiu, Chen Guangfu, and Jiang Yong – in their private capacities, to go to Beiping to contact representatives from the Communist side for peace talks. Yesterday, there was no major development in this matter, so the departure date has not been set. However, Yan Huiqing invited Zhang, Leng, Chen, and Jiang to his residence yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM for tea, which lasted about an hour before dispersing. When the reporter went to visit Mr. Yan, they were having fried noodles together.</p>
<p>Yan's Remarks</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mr. Yan came out to meet the reporter and said in a peaceful tone: "There is no news at the moment. The various rumors about us are not true. The five of us met today because we have had little contact in the past. We took this opportunity to gather and there were no specific issues discussed. Everything still needs to wait for orders from Nanjing. As of now, we have no preparations, for example, an airplane is needed for the trip, which Nanjing has to prepare. Personally, I am 73 years old and have never been on a plane. I also suffer from heart disease and usually live downstairs because I'm afraid of climbing stairs and getting out of breath. So whether I am suitable for flying is a big question. But thinking that I have received many benefits from the country in my life, and this time I am running for the country, society and the people, I am obliged to do so even if I am ill. At most, I will ask a doctor to go with me."</p>
<p>Regarding the plan to contact the Communist Party for peace talks, Mr. Yan said: "There is nothing to talk about this at the moment. I don't know when Nanjing wants us to leave, and I don't know which representatives from the Communist Party we will be contacting in Beiping. I dare not say that this trip has the authority to represent either side, or has the authority to ask the Communist Party to appoint representatives, and the location and time to conduct comprehensive peace talks. But at least several people on this trip are people with some status in society. What we say may be listened to by some people. Therefore, we decided to explain to the Communist Party the people's hope for peace in a private capacity, and at the same time, we will try our best to tell the current sufferings of the people." Mr. Yan concluded: "The door to peace talks has been opened, and I hope this trip will make this door open wider."</p>
<p>Zhang's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Zhang Shizhao, this trip by the five people is purely a private exploration of peace. The overall plan for peace talks will have to wait for government representatives Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, Zhong Tianxin and others to fully negotiate.</p>
<p>It is also rumored that Leng Yuqiu is the most active in expressing his opinion on peace talks among the five people. However, according to Leng's statement to reporters yesterday: This matter was purely decided by Acting President Li. He has not yet made a final decision as to whether he will go to Beiping, so there is no way to talk about his views on peace talks.</p>

<h3 id="e4">De Wang Flew to Shaanxi and Then to Lanzhou <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] De Wang of Inner Mongolia left Nanjing by military plane at 1:30 PM on the 1st, flying to Shaanxi and then to Lanzhou, accompanied by more than a dozen Mongolian people and their families. De Wang came to Nanjing at the invitation of President Chiang nearly a month ago and had contact with various parties in Nanjing, but rarely expressed political opinions. When the reporter asked him at the airport on the 1st about his views on the future of Mongolia, he replied frankly, "Self-determination." This elderly man, loved by the last grassland Mongolians, did not have his national consciousness slightly affected by the suffering of his individual family.

<h3 id="e6">Government's Peace Talk Delegation Ready to Depart; Nanjing People's Peace Delegation Flew to Beiping Yesterday <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] According to Minister of Water Conservancy Zhong Tianxin (note: Zhong is one of the five representatives appointed by the government to contact the Communist Party for peace talks) yesterday: The government's peace talk representatives, Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, etc., may depart from Shanghai in the future and go to the designated location to negotiate peace talks with the Communist Party representatives. However, this matter still depends on the outcome of the trip of Shanghai's prominent figures, Yan Huiqing and others. After the Executive Yuan decided to move to Guangzhou, the next political affairs meeting will be held in Guangzhou. He himself is also scheduled to fly to Guangzhou in the next day or two. According to a report from the Central News Agency: Zhong Tianxin told reporters on the 1st: The personnel of the government's peace talk delegation's secretariat are now concentrated in Shanghai, actively carrying out preparations for future peace talks, such as collecting and sorting out various materials from past political consultations, and collecting international treaties signed by the government over the years. The delegation originally planned to bring a radio station, but if the peace talks are held in Beiping, the radio station will naturally not need to be taken along. In short, all internal affairs of the delegation have been largely prepared, and now they are only waiting for the Communist Party's reply.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The rumor that Shao Lizi drafted a peace talk plan after arriving in Shanghai a few days ago was denied by authoritative sources here yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The weather in the capital was bad on the 1st, and the cloud cover was especially low in the afternoon. Shao Lizi's return to Nanjing was unsuccessful, and he is still stranded in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The Nanjing People's Peace Delegation representatives, Qiu Zhizhong, Wu Yuhou, Deng Jiyu, Song Guoshu, Zeng Zisheng, Wu Zhesheng, Guo Yude, Xia Yuanzhi and other eight people, and a group of news reporters, left Nanjing at 11:30 AM on the 1st by China Airlines special plane via Qingdao for Beiping. They will stay in Beiping for a week to meet with Communist Party members and cultural and educational circles in Beiping to discuss ways to seek comprehensive peace. The delegation is carrying a People's Peace Program to convey the people's fervent hopes and opinions on peace in the rear, and will bring back the Communist Party's opinions when they return.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Lanzhou Dispatch, 1st] Northwest Military and Political Director General Zhang Zhizhong met with reporters this afternoon after arriving in Lanzhou and answered questions as follows: (1) Question: The Communist Party insists on punishing war criminals. Is peace already hopeless? Answer: No, it is not yet possible to say "hopeless." (2) Question: What is the future of the Northwest? Is local peace possible? Answer: The Northwest is the Northwest of China. I am the peace talk representative sent by the central government. I am willing to work hard for comprehensive peace. (3) Question: What are your views on peace? Answer: The people of the whole country want peace, and the government also wants peace. The government and the people's will is completely consistent. Even the Communist Party seems to not want peace. However, after more than 20 years of struggle between the two parties, there will inevitably be disputes and twists and turns when talking about peace. However, in order to show the sincerity of striving for genuine peace, the government should first seek to do its part. However, we must be calm and wait patiently. (4) Question: What do you think of the international situation? Answer: The international situation is trending towards coordination. Judging from the trend of international coordination, the future of China is also optimistic. (5) Is there any change in the military and political situation in the Northwest? Answer: No. (6) Question: What is the current situation in Xinjiang? Answer: The situation of peaceful unification and democracy in Xinjiang is constantly progressing.</p>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 1st] With the return of "Peace General" Zhang Zhizhong to Lanzhou, the military and political leaders of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia have all gathered in Lanzhou. It is generally believed that the meetings in the past few days will determine the fate of war and peace in the Northwest.</p>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 1st] Zhang Zhizhong hosted a banquet for Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui, and local leaders, as well as more than 100 representatives from the Lanzhou Supervisory Committee and public opinion organizations on the evening of the 1st.</p>
<p>[Our Xining Dispatch, 1st] De Genjia Ruo (a respectful title for Tibetan headmen) representative Guan Jia Cai Shi Duo and other seven people from Xikang arrived here and paid a visit to the authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Gan Jihou Talks About Hope for Peace <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Professor Gan Jihou, Acting President Li's personal representative, told reporters who visited him on the 1st: Peace is possible, because after the Communist Party put forward the eight conditions for peace talks, the government has also agreed to conduct peace talks based on these eight conditions. Acting President Li's personal representatives have had several informal contacts with the Communist Party in Beiping, and the process has been quite satisfactory. Therefore, based on these signs, peace is indeed hopeful. Mr. Gan also said: At present, the government's efforts for peace are very sincere, so it also hopes that the Communist Party will also be sincere. He does not understand why the Communist Party cannot be sincere, because the Communist Party has always called for peace for more than 20 years in the past.</p>
<p>At this point, a reporter asked, during the peace talks, if the Communist Party implements the crossing of the Yangtze River, would it be a sign of insincerity towards peace? Mr. Gan replied: Yes. However, he then quoted a certain military observer's view on crossing the river, believing that according to the current situation, the Communist army will not be able to complete the crossing of the river within two months. The strength of the Communist army in the area south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River is not strong after a long period of and multiple wars. Because General Fu Zuoyi still holds 200,000 troops in the North China area, Lin Biao's army cannot go south for a while. Even if they go south, it will still take three or four weeks of preparation to gather a large number of arms, boats, and vehicles for a forced crossing. The main force for crossing the river must be at least 300,000 troops. However, the number and equipment of the National Army in Jiangnan are considerable. If they can defend firmly, it will not be easy for the Communist Party to cross the river. He then cited a historical proof, roughly stating that 50 years ago, Sun Chuanfang led several times as many troops to cross the river and invade Nanjing, but at that time, Acting President Li only used one army to kill Sun's army. Using the past as an example for the present, if the defending troops in Jiangnan are determined to defend firmly, history may not be difficult to repeat.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of moving the capital, Mr. Gan believes that regardless of whether peace is hopeful, the government has to take contingency measures, so the government decided to move to Guangzhou. However, in his personal opinion, he believes that it is too early for the government to move the capital at this time. He also guarantees that Acting President Li will not leave Nanjing and may stay in Nanjing forever. Other heads of government ministries and commissions will need to travel between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in the future depending on the needs of their positions. Therefore, even if the Executive Yuan moves to Guangzhou, and Acting President Li still stays in Nanjing, according to the president being the representative of the government, it can also be said that the government is still in Nanjing.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Taiyuan Dispatch, 1st] The Communist army around Taiyuan may launch its seventh offensive within the week. This was stated by military officials here to reporters today. The officials pointed out various signs that the Communist army may launch an offensive, stating: After the Communist army's disastrous defeat in the sixth offensive in early December of last year, they immediately transferred the soldiers captured in Jinan and the militiamen from various counties in central Shanxi to the vicinity of Taiyuan to replenish their depleted troops, and after a month of reorganization, they have now completed their work. Furthermore, their offensive engineering work has been completed, the Communist army in various areas has increased significantly in recent days, and there is frequent mobilization and transportation. They have also collected a large number of ancestral frames and ladder materials from various counties, and released some captured officers and soldiers to arrange internal responses and launch rumor offensives. Furthermore, the Communist army has repeatedly used artillery fire to test the waters, and the signs of their launching an offensive are becoming increasingly obvious. He continued, although the Communist army is using the current peace talk situation to launch a fierce offensive against Taiyuan to assist in their political conspiracy, we dare to assert that we have the confidence to win, and the Communist army's invasion will suffer a more severe defeat than the previous six times.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Establishment of Joint Organizations in Beiping; Communist Security Teams Continue to Enter the City <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 1st] The Beiping Joint Office was officially established today, and people are generally concerned about the future movements of the organization. Chairman Ye Jianying and the other three representatives are reported to have entered the city and are waiting to take office. Various public groups are busy preparing for celebrations, and newspapers have changed the name of the Communist army to "People's Liberation Army," while the former National Army is called the "Kuomintang Bandit Army." Those who know Russian have posted notices at the door to recruit students, opening a Russian language training class. The Huabei Daily published an advertisement for the sale of "New Russian Grammar." Censorship of telegrams has been lifted, and it is impossible to predict whether it will be restored in the future. It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi's Bandit Suppression Headquarters has been disbanded, and some newspapers have begun to call him Mr. Fu.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 1st] Another 5,000 Communist security team members entered the city today. Today is the fourth day of the New Year, and shops have not yet opened. The New Year atmosphere is still strong. The Forbidden City, Dongjiaominxiang, the airport, and other places have been taken over by the Communist side. Government troops are leaving the city in a steady stream, and students continue to parade and rally to welcome the Communist army.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 1st] As of 5:00 PM today, the Communist authorities here have not yet stipulated the exchange rate between People's Bank banknotes and gold yuan coupons. The black market price is one to thirteen.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 1st] After entering the city yesterday, the Communist army took over the Hebei Provincial Government and other party and government agencies, such as the Beiping branch of the Central News Agency, the Beiping Radio Station, and the Kuomintang-sponsored Huabei Daily. The Catholic-sponsored Yishi Daily has voluntarily ceased publication. The personnel of Fu Zuoyi's headquarters have been reduced to only one-tenth of the original number, and the office has moved to the new Beiping area built by the Japanese in the west. It is rumored that Mr. Fu himself is also there. The Communist army did not cause any trouble after entering the city yesterday. As soon as they entered the city, they stood guard outside the gates of various agencies. The Beiping Joint Office is located in the former Japanese Embassy in Dongjiaominxiang, and the Communist representatives are also staying there. Communist soldiers are seen singing in groups on the streets, and curious crowds are watching and cheering. The Communist army and the government army are very friendly. The Communist soldiers and the former government soldiers who are standing guard in front of the Joint Office have no ill will towards each other, and both sides salute each other before greeting each other. At dusk, a group of students paraded in the streets, holding flags welcoming the Communist army, and carrying huge portraits of Mao Zedong and Zhu De. The slogans they shouted included "Down with unequal treaties." According to reliable sources, the number of Communist soldiers entering the city is about two columns, about 20,000 people. The command of the Beiping Garrison Command has been transferred to the Communist army, and Communist officers are meeting with former government army officers at Fu Zuoyi's headquarters. The Communist army's entry into the city was sudden, so the general public, especially the students, were surprised. Several foreign reporters tried to take pictures of the Communist army entering the city, but were stopped by the political workers of the Communist army. Government troops in prison uniforms were still standing guard at many intersections, blocking traffic to allow the Communist army troops to pass. A group of government officials took several trucks and were sent to Xizhimen to welcome the Communist army, shouting slogans such as "Long live the People's Army," but some seemed a little embarrassed. A certain film company of the government obtained permission from the Communist army to film the Communist army entering the city. Another truck was carrying Communist propaganda personnel, taking pictures at any time. Occasionally, female soldiers in full military uniform in the Communist army attracted even more attention.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 1st] A large truck of the Communist Propaganda Team drove slowly along the street on the morning of the 1st, followed by a band. Propaganda personnel distributed leaflets to the people. The trucks often stopped at intersections, and men and women in blue and white clothes got out of the car and danced for more than ten minutes to entertain the crowd.</p>
<p>Communist political cadres have rapidly taken over Kuomintang propaganda agencies, including radio stations and the former Kuomintang newspaper Huabei Daily. The newspaper will resume publication on the 2nd, renamed People's Daily. All other newspapers continue to publish as usual, but most of their news is now very pro-Communist.</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 1st] The legislators, supervisors, and national representatives remaining in Guangzhou have recently launched the "Guangdong Great Unity" movement.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, telegraphed Sun Ke, President of the Executive Yuan, currently in Shanghai, stating: "President Sun Zhesheng, with highest respect: Recently, the government dispatched personnel to Guangzhou as a contingency measure. However, during these peace talks, it seems appropriate for important leaders to gather in the capital to jointly plan for the benefit of the peace talks. Respectfully offering our opinion, hoping for your wise decision and a reply. Yu Youren, Tong Guanxian, early dawn."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Legislative Yuan President Tong returned to Nanjing on the 31st evening aboard Acting President Li's special plane. He was extremely busy throughout the 1st. In the morning, he went to the Yuan to handle official business, and then successively contacted more than 30 committee members remaining in Nanjing, conveying the opinions of the committee members staying in Shanghai regarding the current situation. In the afternoon, he visited Control Yuan President Yu for a long discussion. It is said that they exchanged opinions on the relocation of the two Yuans to the south. It is understood that quite a few Legislative Yuan members still reside in Nanjing and Shanghai, with most of the Kuomintang members in Shanghai. They unanimously believe that Nanjing should maintain its status as a political center to enhance people's confidence in peace and stabilize social order near the war zones. Judging from various signs, the Legislative and Control Yuans may take unified action, but it is not yet certain whether they will make any statements in the short term. Both Presidents Tong and Yu still have several days of delay in Nanjing, and the Secretaries-General of the two Yuans are also busily traveling between Nanjing and Shanghai, running errands to smooth things out. It is difficult to predict whether the third session of the Legislative Yuan will soon resume in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Sun Ke, Hong Lanyou, and others jointly took a flight back to Nanjing yesterday morning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] According to sources from relevant parties, with the Executive Yuan relocating its office to Guangzhou, President Sun and Deputy Secretary-General Ni Jiongsheng will remain in Nanjing to supervise the remaining personnel of various ministries and commissions and handle affairs in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] Most of the important military and political organs of the capital have been evacuated. Only six transport planes remain at the airport in the city, and less than twelve fighter planes remain at another airport. Half a month ago, there were as many as 250. The navy has only two small warships stationed between Pukou and Nanjing. As for the army, various units are successively passing through Nanjing to the south. The city is filled with wounded soldiers and other scattered troops. The police are still on duty as usual, but it seems that most police teams are also being transferred out. A small number of personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs continue to work, with most having relocated south last week. Public utilities and postal services are operating as usual.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 1st] The Executive Yuan is scheduled to begin operations in Guangzhou on the 5th. More staff members arrived in Guangzhou today. Most senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and various embassies have arrived in Guangzhou.

According to Jiang, the date of the President's arrival in Guangzhou is not yet determined, but officials from various departments and bureaus under the Office will come to Guangzhou within days. Also, government personnel are flocking to Guangzhou, with the most being staff members of the Kuomintang headquarters, including Ma Chaojun, Chen Qingyun, Gu Zhengding, and Xiao Tongzi.

<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st] A spokesman for the Guangdong Provincial Government recently met with a Central News Agency reporter, stating that the February 1st Hong Kong newspapers, based on an Associated Press Guangzhou dispatch of January 31st, carried Chairman Xue's remarks, the content of which did not match the facts: (1) He did not announce the independent status of the four provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Fujian, (2) He did not mention not welcoming the Nanjing government to relocate to Guangzhou, and is in fact welcoming Executive Yuan President Sun Ke to come to Guangzhou to lead.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Wedemeyer's Visit to Japan and the Asian Situation <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The overall situation in Asia is in turmoil, and the United States' Far East policy is becoming increasingly indecisive. At this time of turbulence and uncertainty, the US government has dispatched Secretary of the Army Royal and General Wedemeyer to Japan to visit General MacArthur. According to Tokyo news, Royal and his party are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo around February 1st, and MacArthur is preparing a warm welcome and will discuss the situation in Japan with them. According to Washington news, the mission of Royal and his party to Japan is clearly due to the fact that the Communist Party is advancing steadily in China, and the United States' Asian strategic situation has been greatly affected, and they will jointly review it with MacArthur. Based on the above reports and the general situation, the United States government, at least the Army Department, deeply feels that the wildfire in Asia has reached their eyebrows, and the United States must re-examine or establish a new policy. Royal and Wedemeyer are key members of the US Army Department and planners of President Truman's Asian strategy. Their visit to Japan is a matter worthy of attention.</p>
<p>American foreign policy has always had a tendency to prioritize Europe over Asia. This imbalance was very blatant during the implementation of the Marshall Plan after the war, and has in fact caused some mistakes! The facts of the past two years have shown that the Marshall Plan's emphasis on Europe and neglect of Asia has not saved Europe, let alone revived Europe. On the contrary, it has lost Asia, and watched communism in Asia grow from its roots and spread. The situation in northern China and the expansion of North Korea, as well as the considerable victory of the Communist Party in the recent general election in Japan, all show that the United States' past Far East policy has been a significant failure, and the entire Asian strategic situation of the United States has been greatly changed and affected. The recent personnel adjustments in the State Department have not modified the US policy toward Asia, but the anxiety of the Army Department indicates that the entire Asian strategic situation needs to be re-examined. Although this review is considered to be overdue, if it can truly catch up, it will still be beneficial to the future world situation.</p>
<p>In the future, the US policy toward Asia has only three paths to follow: (1) to sit and watch the continued advance of the Communist Party in China, and even be willing to withdraw from South Korea in order to secure Japan and vigorously support Japan; (2) to coordinate with the Soviet Union, re-determine strategic concessions, and maintain a new balance of power in Asia with the Soviet Union; (3) to conditionally support the Chinese government, strengthen aid to China, and contain the development of communism. The opinions of key members of the US Army Department are more inclined to the third point, while MacArthur's opinions may tend towards the first point. It is reported that MacArthur recently submitted a recommendation to the US government, which supports the first point of view. In fact, simply securing Japan and abandoning China, withdrawing from China, will not save Asia from its crisis. General Wedemeyer knows this very well. The visit of Generals Royal and Wedemeyer to Japan this time, in addition to re-examining the Asian situation and the situation in Japan, may be to negotiate a common opinion as a guideline for the future US policy toward Asia, and this common opinion must first be related to the overall situation in China. Therefore, it is said that this meeting between Royal, MacArthur, and others, its decision and outcome, is very important to the Far East situation, especially to the development of the Chinese situation in the future.</p>
<p>Supporting Japan seems to be an established policy of the United States, and the psychological factor of supporting Japan is mostly to underestimate the current situation in China, which is of no help to the overall Asian policy. General MacArthur implements this policy, and he certainly wants to insist on this policy, but he also said in the past that if the situation in China deteriorates further, it will obviously weaken the position of the United States in Japan, so he has repeatedly advocated actively aiding China. In addition, General Wedemeyer is a friend of China and is familiar with the Chinese situation. He and General Royal seem to be seeking a kind of coordination and compromise with MacArthur, that is, how to quickly strengthen aid to China without hindering the established policy of supporting Japan, in order to contain the continued advance of communism in China and even in Asia. If this decision is achieved, the Asian situation may gradually change in the future, at least the current hesitant attitude will no longer exist. In any case, it is beneficial to the evolution of the current Chinese crisis.</p>
<p>At the same time, Congressman McClen, chairman of the Foreign Economic Cooperation Committee of the new US Congress, stated: It is time for the United States to adopt an anti-communist stance in Asia as it has done in Europe. He also clearly advocated recommending a loan of $1.5 billion to aid China, including military and economic assistance. From this, we can also see the anxious mentality of the United States towards the development of the overall situation in China. We have long said that the Chinese government's previous resistance to communism was for China and at the same time for the world. The United States cannot adopt a "wait-and-see" policy or a "withdrawal" policy. The Chinese government should also understand that seeking peace with the CCP should be limited. Peace is acceptable, but surrender is not. Because it is definitely not the will of the Chinese people to surrender the entire country to communism. Because of this, we attach great importance to the visit of Generals Royal and Wedemeyer to East Asia; in the turbulent situation in Asia, we attach great importance to the change in the US policy toward Asia, especially the change in the policy toward China.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 1st] Yan Jiagan, Director of the Taiwan Provincial Finance Department, reported on the financial situation at a press conference held by the Provincial Information Office today, stating that the estimated income and expenditure of the province for this year are both more than 158.8 billion yuan. Due to the suggestions of the Provincial Assembly to increase the amount, it is still being sorted out by various units. The province's finances have always been based on the principle of balance, and it will never be compensated by issuing currency. As of the end of the year, the amount issued by the Bank of Taiwan totaled 180 billion yuan, and it will inevitably increase in the future, but it is all for production needs. At the end of his speech, Yan expressed his outlook on the economy of the province, saying that with the high increase in agricultural production and the gradual increase in industrial production, the economic future is extremely optimistic. However, the current problem lies in how to actively develop the market, which still requires improvements in production methods, skills, and costs.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 1st] A qualified person here told the reporter: All sectors in the local area are eagerly hoping that Qin Dechun can come to Qingdao soon, so that he can make positive contributions to the current situation. Local people once made efforts for peace, but now they have encountered resistance and are becoming disappointed. Military sources said that the total number of Communist troops in Jiaodong is no more than 45,000. Liu Anqi once said that peace should be peace led by the central government. Family members in the Garrison Headquarters began to evacuate south today. The Jingxing ship was requisitioned and will leave Qingdao in two days. There is no change in the National Army. There were rumors of retreat on the 31st, which has been proven to be inaccurate. Except for the rapid increase in prices following Shanghai, the situation is generally stable.

<p>[United Press Reporter Gao Erya, Qingdao, 1st] Qingdao, long an isolated island in a red sea, is gradually becoming the center of a war of nerves. The Communist army occasionally fires shells near the airport. On the 31st evening, some howitzer shells fell within one mile of the airport area. The airport is currently used by the US Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, commercial airlines, and the Chinese Air Force. The vast majority of the headquarters of the Pacific Fleet may withdraw as soon as possible. It is reported that orders have been issued to load all Marine Corps equipment in Qingdao onto ships. The strength of the National Army stationed around Qingdao is said to be at least four armies, about 60,000 people, but very few troops are seen in the city.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Nanjing Renbao Newspaper Seized Yesterday, Spokesman of Garrison Command Issues Statement <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Nanjing Renbao newspaper here was ordered to be seized by the Capital Garrison Headquarters on the evening of the 1st. The acting editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Wang Shoushan, and the editor of the fourth edition, Li Ji, have been taken into custody. It is said that the publisher of the newspaper, Zhang Youjing, is now in Hangzhou. The Capital Garrison Headquarters decided to hold a reception for the press here at 10:30 a.m. on the 2nd to explain the process of seizing the newspaper.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Tang Enbo, Commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, issued a handwritten order to Zhang Yaoming, Commander of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, on the 1st, stating that "the Nanjing Renbao newspaper is spreading rumors and causing trouble, hindering public security, and should be investigated immediately and dealt with severely according to the law."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The spokesman of the Capital Garrison Headquarters said: "The Headquarters believes that the Nanjing Renbao newspaper in this city is intentionally alienating important military and political officials. Although the Headquarters has repeatedly warned it, the newspaper not only did not accept it, but intensified its efforts. On the 1st, it published a news item without any basis stating that the Capital Police Department 'Director Huang fled and was caught by his subordinates at the airport,' which was intended to provoke police officers to oppose their superiors, thereby inciting unrest and disturbing social order. It wantonly slanders senior public security officials. Although the Headquarters cherishes public opinion, it can hardly sit idly by. Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo has issued a handwritten order to the Headquarters to seize the newspaper and arrest the rumour-mongers for strict punishment. I hope the press will share the difficulties of the times. Please be cautious about publishing any unfounded news that may affect people's hearts and hinder public security."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Nanjing Renbao newspaper here was seized by the Capital Garrison Headquarters for publishing the following news. The original text of the news is as follows:</p>
<p>"Amidst the rumours that some heads of agencies in this city are embezzling funds and fleeing, Huang Zhenwu, Director of the Capital Police Department, who is maintaining local public security, also embezzled a large amount of money yesterday (31st) morning, intending to flee before everyone else. However, he was caught by his subordinates at Minggugong Airport and sent to the Garrison Headquarters for legal action because the matter was not kept secret. This is indeed another scandal amidst the evacuation. The details are recorded below: At around 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, a large truck full of luggage was stalled in the middle of the road in front of the Jindou Furniture Store in Yanling Lane in this city. The military and police came forward to inquire due to their duties. It was only then that they learned that the luggage and other items in the truck belonged to Director Huang and were intended to be transported to Fuzhou. The driver also showed a traffic permit from the police department and spoke strongly, in an arrogant manner. The police on duty were unwilling to endure his arrogance and brought him to the police station and asked Director Huang if the driver's words were true. Unexpectedly, Huang hesitated and said that the luggage belonged to Zhou Jingren, Director of the Supervision Department of the department, and sent a trusted inspector to the station to deliberately tear up the traffic permit. He was also quite annoyed that the driver had easily revealed the Director's secret, and rewarded him with a slap in the face and released him. Although Huang disguised it in this way, his intention to flee has been widely noticed by the police, because the 10,000 yuan evacuation fee that each police officer in the city should receive is still in Huang's hands and not a penny has been issued, which is related to their livelihood, so it is no wonder that there are many doubts. Zhou Jingren, Director of the Supervision Department, was especially indignant at Huang's act of covering up and pretending that the luggage was his, so he secretly monitored Huang's whereabouts. At around 8:00 a.m. in the morning, when Huang arrived at Minggugong Airport to flee and had not yet boarded the plane, he was caught by Zhou and reported to the Garrison Headquarters, which detained him for legal action."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] At around 12:00 noon on the 1st, the Nanjing Renbao newspaper (the original site of Minsheng Daily) on Zhongzheng Road in this city was attacked by more than 20 people wearing blue-gray coats and black Zhongshan suits, who smashed all the light bulbs, telephones, door and window glass, furniture, and sundries inside. The bedroom of Cheng Shewo, President of Shijie Daily, was also affected, but no one was injured.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Across Regions, Commodity Prices Soar; Crackdown on Price Gouging in Wuhan Leads to Improvement <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 1st] Before the Zhenjiang market has even opened its "red board" [for the new year], commodity prices have suddenly soared. Superior quality rice is being quoted at 4,500 yuan, medium quality at 4,000 yuan. Five Rams brand cigarettes and other goods have tripled in price since before the Spring Festival. Yuan silver dollars are at 980 yuan each. The sound of bargaining in the streets is constant, and trading is extremely brisk.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 1st] Here in Hankou, unscrupulous individuals are spreading rumors, causing unrest in the market. Black market silver dollars even rose to 1,400 yuan. Taking advantage of this, merchants are raising prices, with all kinds of goods undergoing sharp increases. However, after the security authorities strictly prohibited the spread of rumors and cracked down on price gouging, the market situation has begun to improve, and black market prices for gold and silver are gradually declining.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 1st] The Nanchang market, just after the Spring Festival, only hears of rising prices. Today's prices are generally 30% to 100% higher than on New Year's Eve. Gold and yarn have not yet opened for trading. Silver dollars are being quoted at a high of 750 yuan, rice at 4,000 yuan, and cigarette prices are up 80% across the board. A full-sized newspaper costs 700 yuan per month, and a quarto-sized one costs 560 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 1st] As Wuhan intensifies its evacuation, the Yuehan Railway is extremely congested, and rumors abound. The rise in the price of silver dollars has become even more severe after the new year, with quotations above 1,000 yuan. All shops are conducting transactions in silver dollars, and in the evening, they are closing and refusing to accept gold yuan, leaving people in a state of anxiety and unease.</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 1st] During the Spring Festival in Chengdu, commodity prices skyrocketed. Rice, cloth, yarn, cigarettes, and all kinds of goods saw a "red" opening [a bullish start to trading]. Unscrupulous merchants are also creating a "nickel rush," with nickel coins being marked up tenfold. The prices of daily necessities and general commodities have increased tenfold. Rice is 4,000 yuan per "shi" [unit of dry volume], and black market gold has surpassed the 50,000 mark.</p>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 1st] After the Spring Festival, commodity prices in Lanzhou are steadily increasing. Silver coins have reached 700 yuan apiece. The power plant has indefinitely suspended electricity supply. At night, apart from a few streetlights and government buildings, the entire city is plunged into darkness. Newspapers have suspended publication for another three days. Government employees and ordinary citizens are distraught amidst the rumors.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Stalin Shows a New Attitude of Peace; US Hopes for Factual Demonstrations; Lie Suggests UN Headquarters as Meeting Place for US and Soviet Leaders <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 31st] President Truman today met with Secretary of State Acheson to discuss the questions raised by American reporters to Stalin, lasting for forty minutes. No statement was released by the White House after the meeting.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 31st] The United States needs to consider Stalin's new peace overtures carefully before responding. Today, it was heard that an idea is under consideration, the content of which is to use this peace meeting to conduct a comprehensive review of the history of Soviet postwar negotiations with Western countries, and then re-request Moscow to provide concrete evidence proving that this action is indeed out of sincerity. White House Press Secretary Ross told reporters that President Truman still maintains his previously published statement, that he is ready to meet with Stalin in Washington at any time, but has no opinion to express at present. It was also heard from officials here in private that the United States now has a new Congress, Secretary of State Acheson is also a new face, and President Truman's new term has just begun. Under this completely new situation, Stalin has this new posture, and we should be especially careful to clarify the US government's attitude towards the Soviet Union, so as not to offend Congress and other aspects of peaceful sentiment. Some people also suspect that Stalin's indication at this time is still for propaganda purposes, and not to explore the US attitude towards the abandonment of suspicion and reconciliation between the East and West.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 31st] UN Secretary-General Lie said today that if President Truman and Premier Stalin are willing to meet, he intends to provide the United Nations' facilities in the United States or Europe for the two politicians to use as a meeting place.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 31st] Various circles of the United Nations are discussing today the possibility of Secretary-General Lie's suggestion to Truman and Stalin to use Lake Success as a meeting place, or at least the United Nations will sincerely exert its efforts to facilitate this meeting. Some observers point out that Stalin may have fewer objections to Lake Success as a meeting place than to going to Washington, because the UN headquarters is in an international position, which is easier to guarantee security. Lie has so far refused to express any opinion on his own will, but it is understood that Lie will discuss this matter with experts and diplomats in the next few days, and study how he should take advantage of this special opportunity if Stalin's answer can be taken at face value. Some observers in the United Nations believe that Lie can now invoke the Mexican proposal unanimously passed at the UN General Assembly in Paris before, which called on the great powers to redouble their efforts to resolve their differences, so as to lay the foundation for lasting peace.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 1st] US Secretary of the Army Royal and his party arrived here from Alaska this afternoon. MacArthur and other senior generals welcomed them at the airport. Royal went to the US Embassy after getting off the plane.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st, United Press] State Department officials said: Secretary of the Army Royal's mission to Japan has nothing to do with the victory of the Japanese Communist Party in the Japanese elections. Observers believe that although Royal does not intend to go to China on this trip, some generals of the US Military Advisory Group to China, who recently withdrew from China to Japan, will explain the situation in China to Royal and Wedemeyer.</p>

<p>MacArthur Vigorously Opposed This Plan</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chicago, 1st] The Daily News' Washington special dispatch yesterday strongly stated that Secretary of the Army Royal's trip to Japan was to force MacArthur to agree to a plan to deprive other countries related to the Pacific of their right to speak on the occupation of Japan. Royal advocated establishing Japan as an anti-Soviet base in the Pacific, stopping the American-style reforms, and restoring Japan to its pre-war state. If this plan is implemented, MacArthur will be relieved of his title as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Far East and will only serve as Commander of the US Forces in the Far East. From then on, the instructions given to MacArthur by the US government will not need to be discussed by the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission. It is heard that MacArthur strongly opposed this plan, and the two sides may have a showdown.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Copenhagen, 1st] The attitude of the three Scandinavian countries towards the North Atlantic Alliance can be decided within ten days. Norway is in favor of joining Western countries, or may take action first. Sweden will probably adhere to its traditional policy of neutrality, and Denmark's attitude is between the two. Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange reported to the Parliament today on the failure of the Scandinavian defense negotiations. The Foreign Minister's report launched a debate on the Labor government's defense policy. The Labor Party National Committee unanimously approved the government's policy last night. The Danish Parliament will also launch a debate on foreign policy next week. The Farmers' Party and the Conservative Party in the Parliament are in favor of joining the West. The Norwegian foreign policy debate may affect Denmark's attitude, and Denmark is also somewhat dependent on Sweden's attitude.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Washington, 1st Broadcasting: State Department Spokesman McDermott stated that the United States hopes to soon meet with Norway and other countries and consult with them on whether they are willing to join the proposed North Atlantic Treaty.</p>

According to the hotel, it has always been a gathering place for Red Army officers on vacation. Since the Soviet army withdrew from Czechoslovakia, prominent Soviet figures often reside in it. Vyshinsky himself often rests there for several days when he passes through the Czech Republic on his way back home from London or Paris, and sometimes he brings his wife and daughter with him.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 31st] A Polish government spokesman today denied rumors that Deputy Prime Minister Chaiwadiki or Prime Minister's Secretary-General Yuan Erman had gone to other countries to attend meetings with Vyshinsky or other Soviet leaders.

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st, United Press] President Truman announced today the de jure recognition of Israel and its neighboring country, Transjordan. This action, which the two countries have been looking forward to for a long time, was realized immediately after Israel officially announced the results of its first election. The United Kingdom and several Western European countries have already recognized Israel de facto or temporarily last week. Truman's simultaneous recognition of Israel and Transjordan may be to reduce the dissatisfaction of Arab countries. Due to the strategic oil reserves in the Near East, the United States was forced to take a middle course in the dispute between Israel and its neighboring countries at one point in the past. Israel and Arab countries want to reach a permanent agreement to stop the bloodshed and war in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations. The full recognition of Israel by the United States can also be expected to increase Israel's chances of joining the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 31st] Israeli Prime Minister Gurion made his first broadcast speech after the general election tonight, saying that Israel's foreign policy will be based on maintaining friendly relations with the United States and the Soviet Union. The Jewish-Arab alliance is dedicated to supporting the United Nations and promoting world peace.

<p>[Our Newspaper News] The issue of tuition fees for private primary and secondary schools in the city was previously discussed by Director Li of the Education Bureau before the Lunar New Year, who gathered the principals of each school to agree on the tuition fees of the previous semester converted into food rice as the standard.

<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Professors' Associations of National Jiaotong University and Fudan University jointly sent a telegram to the government a few days ago, calling for improved treatment and the issuance of three months of contingency expenses and food storage fees. The telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>Acting President Li, President Sun of the Executive Yuan, and Acting Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education: We are teaching in Shanghai and living a poor life. Recently, we have seen that current commodity prices have risen more than a hundred times since the price limit of August 19, while our treatment is only 15 times the base salary. If converted according to today's silver coin market price, the highest treatment among us is only 45 yuan per month. Therefore, income and expenditure cannot be balanced, and life is on the verge of desperation. Moreover, the school authorities' regular expenses have also reached the end of their rope, and the government will move to Guangzhou on February 5. Although Deputy Minister Tian of the Ministry of Education has promised to allocate contingency expenses for universities in Shanghai within the month, there is still no news so far. We specially send this telegram to you, in addition to appealing for a reasonable improvement in our treatment, we also request the issuance of three months of contingency expenses and three months of food storage fees, all based on the price index at the time of payment. Please advance the above items from the National Bank, guaranteed by the government, to alleviate the accumulated difficulties and ensure life. We earnestly appeal, and we hope you will listen to us.

<p>Green Train No. 275, a special evacuation train, carried personnel from the Presidential Palace southward. The train consisted of two first-class cars, two second-class cars, and two covered freight cars, all mixed together. When it departed from Nanjing Central Station, it was agreed with the Presidential Palace that the four first- and second-class cars on the train could not travel south on the rails and would have to be replaced with third-class cars upon arrival in Shanghai. The Railway Bureau requested the replacement of the third-class cars after the train arrived at the northern station of this city the afternoon before yesterday, and contacted the Presidential Palace personnel. At that time, they gave a vague promise, but requested that the Railway Bureau keep the cars properly protected to prevent them from being occupied by other units. The Railway Bureau thought that this issue had been resolved, but unexpectedly, at around 10:00 AM yesterday, more than one hundred people, led by a Secretary Zhu, surrounded the dispatching office and the car assignment office, insisting on having the original first- and second-class cars travel south on the rails.

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The first phase of the Risen Sun Building flood prevention project, from the intersection of Xizang Road and Fengyang Road to the intersection of Ningbo Road and Guizhou Road, with a total length of 222 meters of newly built ditches, was completed in its entirety in late last month after day and night work. The Flood Prevention Committee then convened a joint meeting of the engineering and finance groups the other day, chaired by Zhao Zukang, the director of the Public Works Bureau, to discuss how to proceed. Although the municipal government has allocated special funds for the second phase of the project, from the intersection of Ningbo Road and Guizhou Road to the intersection of Tianjin Road and Zhejiang Road, in order to avoid rising labor costs, the Public Works Bureau should allocate long-term workers and a portion of regularly maintained materials. It can be carried out within days, and efforts should be made to complete it within three months.</p>
<p>Due to the sharp price fluctuations during the first phase of the project, the funds were insufficient by more than 150,000 yuan.

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] After the tragic collision between the "Taiping" and "Jianyuan" ships, the Relief Committee, composed of family members of the victims from the Shanghai side, is actively handling registration matters. As of last night, the number of people who have registered has reached more than 800. At the same time, a portion of the family representatives went to the Municipal Government at noon yesterday to meet with Mayor Wu, requesting that the authorities urge the two companies to handle the aftermath. Another portion of the family representatives went to inspect the waters off the coast on the "Haichuan" ship. The ship arrived at 1:00 PM yesterday at Hangzhou Bay East, 31.32 degrees north latitude, 122.28 degrees east longitude, about 70 nautical miles from Shanghai's Half-Yangshan Island, and immediately began searching nearby. The representatives also boarded the Jin Wanlong motorized sailboat, led by the shipowner Hu Zhilong, to search the island, but the sea was calm and there was still nothing to be found by night. The ship will remain at sea to continue the search today, hoping to accurately determine the location where the Taiping and Jianyuan ships sank first.</p>
<p>Regarding the location of the two ships' accident, according to a public announcement from the Jianghai Customs Maritime Affairs Department, the Jianyuan sank between Baijie Mountain and Half-Yangshan Mountain, while the Taiping sank about 4.5 nautical miles southeast of the Baijie Mountain Lighthouse. As for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the day after the two ships' accident, at the request of Yixiang and Zhonglian companies, it dispatched the Min 305 ship to search the Zhoushan Islands area. According to its report submitted after returning to Shanghai: "Arrived at Daji Mountain at 8:00 PM on the 28th. Due to the darkness, it was impossible to work, so it was decided to anchor. Departed at 5:00 AM on the 29th and arrived at Baijiemen. At around 7:00 AM, the steam whistle was sounded, but there was no movement. Later, the course was changed to Franklin Reef, and a signal was made every five minutes along the way. At that time, the wind was calm and the sea was smooth, and it was just during low tide. Only fuel oil floating on the surface was seen. Later, a small sampan was seen in Baijiemen, so it turned back to inquire. According to the fishermen on the sampan: They had seen a ship sinking in the Baijiemen channel on the evening of the 27th while on land. At that time, lifeboats were lowered, and the crying of children and women could be heard. The lights were very bright, but they were affected by the receding tide, and the sampans could not rush to the landing place in Baijiemen, etc. Then, it sailed to Ba Lai Island, the lower part of the Sanxing Lighthouse Mountain, and Franklin Reef and other islands. In order to find people and floating objects, in addition to paying attention at all times, air whistles were also released, but there was still nothing. Within a distance of two or three nautical miles outside Baijiemen and near Franklin Reef, ship fuel oil was floating on the surface, and occasionally alcohol bottles and boxes could be seen. Later, on the return journey, the tide was rising, and oil stains could also be seen in the Baijiemen channel. When inspecting the navigation in various places, we saw a Jingxing boat from the customs anchoring between Half-Yangshan Mountain and Baijie Mountain, exchanging information. As a result, we learned that they were also exploring the location of the sunken ship. By 10:00 AM, all the areas that should have been inspected had been completed. On the way back to Shanghai, a hatch board was seen floating on the surface near Daji Mountain." The location of the sunken ship measured in the report is slightly different from that announced by the Customs, but based on its patrol and observations, the sunken ship may be near Baijie Mountain and Half-Yangshan Mountain. This issue is currently being carefully studied by all parties involved.</p>

<p>American President Lines Is Considering</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to news from the San Francisco headquarters received by American President Lines, the company's president, George Killion, revealed at a recent special meeting with reporters that the company is considering the possibility of managing the American Ship Monterey Steamship. The ship may join the Pacific route. The Monterey is an excellent passenger ship that sails between the South Pacific and Australia. If the company can use the ship to serve the densely populated areas of the Far East, it will be refitted to increase the number of third-class cabins to facilitate business. However, the estimated cost of the refit is approximately US$10 million to US$12 million. American President Lines currently has two new ships, the President Wilson and the President Cleveland, and two new-style passenger ships converted from military transport ships, the General Gordon and the General Meigs, sailing the Pacific route. If the Monterey joins the fleet, the lineup of ships will be even stronger.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhang Yiping, a 25-year-old dancer from Ningbo, rented a residence at No. 18 Yue Shun Li, Yunnan Road. Zhang met businessman Yang Yihe at the Dahua Ballroom in 1947 while working as a dance partner, and they soon cohabited at No. 6 Qunyu Fang, Guangdong Road. The matter was discovered by Yang's legal wife, Shen Jingzhi, who found the place and found them both there. She quarreled with her husband Yang Yihe on the spot. As a result, a statement was written and handed to Shen for safekeeping, stating that he had broken off the relationship with Zhang. In fact, the relationship was still going strong. They then moved to No. 18 Yuren Li, Yunnan Road, to cohabit. It was not until October of the following year that Shen found out again and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Bureau, who arrested the two. At that time, Shen did not want her husband to be subject to criminal punishment and only ordered Zhang to write a statement as a break in the relationship. Unexpectedly, on January 28 of this year, Shen learned that they were still cohabiting and went to the address. A mutual fight broke out, and both suffered minor injuries. The police were called and taken to the Lao Zha Precinct together. The two injured women were sent to Hongren Hospital for treatment.

<p>The Shanghai Police basketball team, formerly known as the Morning Friends, riding the momentum of their victory over Enkas in the Group A league, overcame another obstacle last night, defeating the U.S. Marine Corps Marines with a score of 60 to 49. The Shanghai Police led the entire way, playing with ease and achieving a smooth victory. Despite the American team's height advantage, it was to no avail. The halftime score was 25 to 17, with the Shanghai Police leading by four baskets. It seems the Shanghai Police will have a brilliant record in this year's league. Last night also featured two Group B matches: (1) Group C Beryl defeated the Fat Team, 46 to 43; (2) Group D Shantou team came from behind to defeat Pu Shui, 37 to 26. The game reports are as follows:</p>
<p>Fat Team Unable to Endure</p>
<p>Group B C Beryl and the Fat Team were the first to clash. Beryl's young players entered the court and immediately gained the upper hand, leading 10 to 4. The Fat Team, all veterans of the arena, pressed closely, closing the score gap. At the end of the first half, Beryl led by only one point, the score being 19 to 18. After switching sides, the two teams fought fiercely, with numerous fouls and tense play. The Fat Team relied on Dong Yangfeng's shooting to briefly take a 31 to 30 lead, but it was a fleeting moment, and they ultimately succumbed. In the end, Beryl narrowly defeated the Fat Team 46 to 43.</p>
<p>Pu Shui Crumbles</p>
<p>Following that, Group B C Shantou team and Pu Shui faced off. After the initial contact, Pu Shui appeared very active, with Sun Weixi's shooting being quite accurate, quickly leading 6 to 0. Shantou called a timeout, but changing players was ineffective, and they lost another point. Subsequently, Shantou changed their strategy, playing a steady offense and careful defense, gradually closing the gap, initially tying at 9 each, and then taking the lead for the first time at 11 to 10. Pu Shui was unwilling to concede and responded, ending the first half tied at 15, with no clear winner. At the start of the second half, Shantou reversed their lackluster performance from the first half, with Chen Mingyi, Luo Shaoqiong, and others scoring frequently, taking a 24 to 15 lead and maintaining it throughout. Pu Shui tried to catch up but could not, the difference remaining around five or six points. By the end of the match, Shantou defeated Pu Shui 37 to 26.</p>
<p>Shanghai Police Take the Lead</p>
<p>Finally, in the Group A match, the Shanghai Police faced the Marines. As the two teams began to clash, He Zeng scored on a free throw, opening the scoring for the Shanghai Police. Goffins reached in with his long arms, and Rong Sheng responded. The Shanghai Police led throughout, and the Marines called a timeout at 7 to 4. Reese made a free throw, and He Zeng scored again. After 10 to 7, Bo Wen and He Zeng transported the ball and scored under the basket. The foreign team called another timeout, with the score at 14 to 7, a difference of half. The foreign team conferred closely and used high passes, which the Shanghai Police found difficult to intercept, allowing the foreign team to score four points. However, the police team quickly improved, with Bo Wen, Qi Xia, Jiu Quan, and Yong Biao all scoring successfully, but the Marines suffered more losses than gains. At the end of the first half, the Shanghai Police led 25 to 17, with a four-basket advantage.</p>
<p>American Military Defeated</p>
<p>After the break, Jin Gui and Rong Sheng of the Shanghai Police replaced Wang Bo Wen and Fu Qi Xia, while Reese of the Marines was replaced by Lyme Shan. The Shanghai Police performed exceptionally well. Jin Gui dismounted and exerted his power, and O'Ungate immediately responded. The Shanghai Police called a timeout, but could not blunt their momentum. O'Ungate scored twice, and Jockson committed a foul, allowing He Zeng to score a free throw. Reese scored, and the police team called a timeout. Reese scored again, and Rong Sheng and Yong Ke scored three points with a shot and a free throw, making it 31 to 25. After that, both sides scored, forming a seesaw battle. The Shanghai Police appeared active again, and the score went from 54 to 48. Shi Jiuquan and Yong Biao made three out of three shots, making it 60 to 48. As time expired, the Marines lost to the Shanghai Police.</p>

<p>Two or Three Things After Chen Bulei's Death  Jun Mo</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Nanjing Fast News, 1st] After Mr. Chen Bulei passed away in Nanjing on November 13th of last year, his remains were buried on December 10th north of Xu Village, Jiuxi Shiba Jian in Hangzhou, on a small mountain in Fan Village Tea Pavilion Lao. The location faces the mountains and overlooks the river, with quiet scenery. Hangzhou was a place that Mr. Chen often visited during his lifetime. Besides his hometown of Cixi, Hangzhou may have been his favorite place. He studied in Hangzhou in his early years and later served as the Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education for quite some time. Because he loved the fresh and beautiful scenery of Hangzhou, he and his friends jointly purchased six acres of mountain land, which is where he is buried today. At the time, he originally intended to retire from political affairs when he was old and weak, and live in the mountains, building a few simple bungalows to read and write, to spend his remaining years. Unexpectedly, the country is in such difficulty, and this hope has never been fulfilled. However, the few acres of land he bought were not very suitable as a residence, because it was too far from the city and transportation was very inconvenient, but as a burial site, whether it is an expert Feng Shui master or an ordinary passerby, they all feel that this is a good place. Because it is high and refreshing, with undulating mountains behind it, and an endless view in front, the Qiantang River is like a belt, winding at its feet, and the atmosphere is indeed majestic with a touch of charm. The construction of the tomb has been accelerated by the engineering division of the funeral committee, and it has been largely completed, leaving only the tombstone and epitaph to be engraved. The tombstone will be inscribed by Qian Taixi, in accordance with Mr. Chen's lifelong ambition of indifference, with only "The Tomb of Mr. Chen Bulei" inscribed, without listing any official titles. The epitaph will be written by Chen Zhiting, and will be completed soon. From then on, this perfect person in spirit will be buried here, adding another place to the scenic spots of the lake and mountains for people to remember and mourn.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's family is now organizing Mr. Chen's diaries, manuscripts, letters, calligraphy, etc., preparing to publish them in succession. The "Memoirs" written by Mr. Chen himself during his lifetime has already been published. This is a chronological autobiography, from his birth to the age of fifty (1939). As for the ten years from the age of fifty to his death, because it has not been written into the memoirs, it can only be supplemented by the diary. This memoir records various matters of his family, his study experience, his dedication to the news industry, and his subsequent entry into politics. Many things in it have never been known to the outside world. For those who study modern history, it is certainly an important document. For those who study Mr. Chen's character and personality, this is also the most direct and reliable information. The book is published by the Twentieth Century Publishing House, and all are exquisitely printed in photogravure to preserve the original handwriting.</p>
<p>After the "Memoirs", the diaries and manuscripts have also been organized, but the letters are difficult to collect and will be difficult to publish in the short term. Mr. Chen kept a diary every day, without interruption for many years. Because he had severe insomnia, he could not fall asleep every night without taking sleeping pills, and the amount of medicine he took every night was also recorded in his diary. Therefore, these diaries contain the ups and downs of political tides, the understanding of career and life, and the narration of trivial matters around him. Once sorted out, they can be published. As for the submission of manuscripts, during the Northern Expedition's sweep of the north and south, the text of "Weilei" can be said to be known to women and children. Once an article was published, it was recited by tens of thousands of people. The commentaries he wrote in Tianduo Daily, Shangbao, and Shishi Xinbao have all been cut and pasted into albums. During his lifetime, Mr. Chen used his spare time to select these articles himself. Now he will compile and publish some of the articles he selected himself. In this way, his words will be as immortal as his personality in the world.</p>
<p>Some people in the Hong Kong press, in order to commemorate this veteran fighter in the press, and to develop the news industry in South China and Southeast Asia, and to cultivate foreign news talents, have launched the establishment of the "Bugong News Academy" in Hong Kong, which is actively preparing and will soon be enrolling students. The school building of Cixi Middle School in Mr. Chen's hometown was initiated and raised by Mr. Chen last year, and it was also completed on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>After Mr. Chen's death, the President issued a commendation order, saying that he "adheres to the principles of Tao, is loyal to the country, respects himself, and is conscientious in handling finances, and is a role model for human ethics." However, the press feels that they have lost a kind, amiable, and tireless elder, and the people have lost a public servant who is willing to endure hardships for the people day and night. His deeds are to be submitted to the National History Museum. The Biography of Chen Bulei in the National History has been drafted by Sha Menghai (Wenruo), a famous ancient writer from Yin County. The content is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chen Bulei, originally named Xunen, courtesy name Yanji, was from Cixi, Zhejiang. The Chen brothers were famous for their literature. His elder brother Huai was good at poetry and classical prose, and eventually became the Speaker of the Zhejiang Provisional Senate. He has his own biography. Bulei was fourteen years old when he took the government examination. The governor Yu Zhaofan specially appreciated him and placed him first. The following year, he was admitted to the county school. Soon, he graduated from Zhejiang Higher School. His writing initially followed Yang Minzeng and Feng Hui from the same county, and then he extensively read the works of famous Chinese and Western jurists. He was especially good at political commentary. In the third year of the Qing Xuantong reign, he and Dai Chuan, from Wuxing, were young men in charge of the commentary of the Tianduo Daily, and their reputation was sensational for a time. When Wuchang launched the uprising, Shanghai newspapers still did not dare to publicly advocate revolution. Bulei was the first to write ten articles about Hubei to promote it. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, he was the chief editor of the Shangbao. When the Kuomintang was reorganized and the National Revolutionary Army launched the Northern Expedition, the Shangbao was not run by the party. It spoke out for justice, creating theories to attack the Northern Warlords in response to the National Revolution. The power of its pen was almost as great as that of the military. Later, he became the chief editor of the Shishi Xinbao. When Japan invaded Jinan, Bulei immediately revealed the meaning of punishing the violent Japanese. Then he said: Is it appropriate to declare war on foreign countries before the country is unified? So he changed his words, urging the people of the country to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens to complete the unification. Later, the government secretly issued propaganda policies, which were in complete agreement with Bulei's suggestions. When President Chiang Kai-shek of today went to Nanchang for the Northern Expedition, he immediately asked Bulei to join the Kuomintang. After Zhejiang was settled, he was appointed as the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, then as the Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, and served two terms as the Director of the Zhejiang Department of Education, one term as the Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education, and Vice Minister of Political Affairs, and concurrently as the Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. In 1934, he began to participate in Chiang Kai-shek's government, serving as the Chairman of the Design Committee of the Nanchang Headquarters, and later as the Director of the Second Department of the Adjutant's Office. Japan was plotting against us urgently, and our government was superficially dealing with them while secretly preparing for war. Bulei wrote a poem "Enemy or Friend," clarifying that China must not succumb, and Japan must consider the security of East Asia, so that the public opinion in Japan, which was hesitant and without a master, would be vigilant. He published it under a pseudonym, and Japanese newspapers competed to translate and publish it. Those who plotted to invade us were dismayed to see it, and suspected that the article was authorized by our government. During the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek personally took charge of the party, government, and military, and had been in a pivotal position for a long time. He gained his exclusive trust, and they were always consistent. Bulei was regarded as the number one person to work with and achieve success. Bulei was also cautious and self-aware, not boasting about his achievements, not talking about his salary, and all his reports were based on public loyalty. He offered what was possible and rejected what was not, and did not choose what was beneficial to himself. Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly wanted to expand the duties of the Adjutant's Office, saying: "So-and-so, you can also handle it." Bulei always refused, saying: "There is already someone in charge." Internal and external high-ranking officials had difficulties that they could not ask for themselves. He must secretly and earnestly report them without letting them be heard outside. Those who had accumulated disagreements, he always mediated between them, without making accusations. He entered and exited the government offices silently and rarely spoke negatively, seemingly doing nothing, but when he faced major issues, he argued and debated firmly, never willing to compromise. Chiang Kai-shek relied on him like his right and left hands. During annual meetings and major reforms, all the documents informing friendly countries, rebuking enemy countries, admonishing officials, and informing soldiers and civilians, as well as the speeches broadcasted on wireless, were mostly written by Bulei. His articles and arguments, which were expressed outwardly, were commonly seen by the world, but as for his planning in the tent, assisting in major plans, and achieving his goals without claiming his name, it was not something that outsiders could know. Bulei served in the Adjutant's Office for the longest time. In 1939, he also served as the Deputy Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council. In August 1945, Japan surrendered. In September, he resigned from the Adjutant's Office and devoted himself to the affairs of the National Defense Council. Later, he was transferred to the National Government Committee. After the implementation of constitutional government, he changed to the National Policy Advisor of the Presidential Palace, and served as the Acting Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee. He was physically weak, often ill, sensitive to things, and quick to see opportunities. Once he was committed to serving in office, he always had the people, things, country, and nation in his heart. Being in a close position, he experienced many changes. Seeing that the habits of officials were becoming increasingly lax and the norms of the country were becoming lax, he was determined to rectify them. He believed that as a staff member, he was not in a responsible position, and he did not want to overstep the authority of others. So he secretly made plans to make up for and remedy the situation, removing what was too much and what was too extreme, silently operating and gradually changing things. His perseverance was something that ordinary people could not bear. Since he knew that his strength was about to fail, he was deeply thoughtful, sad, and unable to relieve himself. In November 1948, his family went to Shanghai for business, and Bulei stayed in Nanjing alone. He calmly wrote twelve letters to Chiang Kai-shek and to his family and friends, placing them on his pillow. Then, he swallowed an excessive amount of sleeping pills and committed suicide. The next day, at noon, the servant was late to call him to wake up. He pushed open the door and entered, and realized that something was wrong. He touched him, and his breath was already gone. He was fifty-nine years old. His letter to Chiang Kai-shek said: "Since this spring, I have been stimulated by what I have seen and heard. After summer and autumn, my illness has increased day by day, and my nerves are extremely weak. I am really unable to support myself reluctantly. At this most difficult time for the party and the country, I have verified that my body and mind have no ability to serve. Rather than stealing life and occupying a position, causing you to miscalculate, thinking that there is still a subordinate who can be driven, and thus delaying official duties, it is better to frankly admit that I am incapable and end my worthless life." He also said: "Bulei's intention arose several years ago, and recently it arose between July and August. I often recite the phrase 'The cake is exhausted, and only the shame remains,' and I am depressed all day long. Han Yu said, 'The senior officials of the central government are old in their affairs, how can they know that gratitude is in vain?' As the years pass, I cannot help in times of danger. I ask myself with a clear conscience, and I really feel that there should be no grateful and lightly alive people in wartime, and this body is not one that can serve in times of danger. The days are long and I am ashamed and have nowhere to go. In the past, when you heard Ye Ju slander the words of the Premier, you put down your chopsticks and did not eat. Now, what I have heard and seen among the general people is countless rumors and slanders spread by poisonous propaganda about you. Recalling thirty-two years ago, you ordered me to pay attention to the enemy's counter-propaganda. For the past four or five years, Bulei has not made any effort to reverse this malicious propaganda. This is just one end, and there is absolutely no reason for me to forgive and protect myself. My heart is pure and upright, and I have no other selfish thoughts except loyalty to you. Now, I am filled with regret that I cannot forgive myself, and I have come to this unforgivable ending. It is out of psychological depression and is a last resort. I dare to tell you again." Bulei's death was different from that of Qu Yuan, but his will was pure and his actions were honest, pure and unblemished. Chiang Kai-shek heard the news and came to see him in person, weeping loudly over the body. He attended the funeral and memorial service several times, and provided generous compensation. His posthumous works include Weilei Chamber's Literary Collection and Memoirs. The Memoirs is his self-written chronicle of his life.</p>
<p>A certain military observer told reporters: Can the Communist Army grow wings to cross the Yangtze River?</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Zhenjiang 30th] According to a well-informed military observer here, the Yangtze River is a natural barrier, and it is absolutely impossible for the Communist army to cross the river in the short term. The Shanghai-Nanjing line should be as peaceful as ever. I hope people's hearts will be stable and don't disturb themselves. He continued: In the history of Chinese warfare since ancient times, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River have been natural barriers that military strategists can defend, and besides, the government has a strong navy and air force, which is more than enough to blockade the vast Yangtze River. On the other hand, the Communist army has no warships or planes, and it is difficult to fly across the river even with wings.</p>
<p>He also said: Assuming that the Communist army wants to cross the Yangtze River on a large scale, and assuming that fifty people ride on a large civilian boat, then at least a thousand civilian boats are needed, and now the Yangtze River coast has long been blockaded. Where do so many boats come from? Taking a step back: Even if there are a thousand boats carrying a large number of Communist troops south, and the "northwest wind" helps, blowing across the river overnight, the Shanghai-Nanjing area is also heavily guarded by troops and artillery, and the sea and air are patrolling and monitoring. How would the Communist Party dare to take such a big risk to cross the river and die? So I think Shanghai-Nanjing can be settled, and Jiangnan can be foolproof.</p>
<p>British Economy in the Past Year  Ben Geng</p>
<p>[Our newspaper London 20th Dispatch] According to past practice, the British government usually publishes a white paper on the economic situation in March every year, on the one hand to review the situation of the past year, and on the other hand to explain the plans for the coming year. That is probably one of the best reference materials for observing the current state of the British economy. At present, this white paper has not yet been published, and some economic statistics have not yet been announced. The explanation in this article is based on what can be generally known, but it is mainly based on the recent talks of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps.</p>
<p>Overall Balance Not Yet Achieved</p>
<p>Foreign trade is the main body of Britain's current economic problems. The provisional figure for exports in December last year was 145.7 million pounds, a decrease of 1.4 million pounds compared with November of the same year, but November had one more "working day" than December. If calculated by the average daily export volume, December was 3% higher than November. The deficit (i.e., import surplus) of visible trade in December was 26.5 million pounds, a decrease of 2.2 million pounds compared with November, and the lowest monthly import surplus since January 1947. The total number of exports and re-exports for the whole year, based on monthly statistics, was 10.48 billion pounds, and imports were 2.08 billion pounds. Comparing the upper and lower halves of the year, the deficit in the first half of the year was 251 million pounds, while the deficit in the second half of the year was only 181 million pounds. Comparing the quantity with the past, the export volume of the United Kingdom in 1947 was 9% higher than that in 1938. The export rate in the first half of 1948 was 30% higher than that in 1938, and it increased to 42% in the second half of the year. Comparing the value of imports and exports, in 1938, the value of exports was about 64% of the value of imports, in 1947 it was about 72%, and in 1948 it was 85% to 90%. It is obvious that foreign trade is gradually improving. But Britain's current goal seems to be to achieve the so-called "Overall Balance." The meaning of this "Overall Balance" is explained as that a country's consumption will not be more than what it produces. This kind of "balance" must be that exports are sufficient to pay for imports, and Britain has not yet been able to achieve this today.</p>
<p>Not only that, Britain not only needs to promote exports, but also needs to export to specific countries. These countries naturally include the countries of origin of British imports. The most important are the United States and Canada, followed by Argentina, Belgium, and Switzerland, all of which are so-called "hard currency" countries. But since the middle of 1947, only exports to Canada have improved, while exports to Belgium and Switzerland have declined slightly in recent months. Most of these countries have not banned imports, and the competition in these countries is very fierce. The method for Britain to deal with these countries, in addition to exporting to them, is to originally purchase from them, but now change to purchasing from other non-dollar countries. In 1948, imports were about one-fifth less than imports in 1938 in terms of quantity. In this reduced quantity, food, alcohol, and tobacco decreased from 47% of the total imports to 41%. On the contrary, raw materials increased from 27% of the total imports to 33%.</p>
<p>Worker Numbers Slightly Increased</p>
<p>To reduce imports and promote exports, it is necessary to increase production. The index of all industrial production in October last year was 27% higher than the monthly average in 1946. The number of "working population" is relatively stable, with 19.2 million people working in civil affairs at the end of October. In other words, the working population is limited by the absolute number of the population. Therefore, with no major changes in the working population, to increase production, it is necessary to increase the individual output of each worker. Last year, the number of workers in some important industries increased slightly. For example, the textile industry increased by 35,000 people, but it was still less than expected. It was expected that coal miners would increase by 31,000 people, but in reality only 6,000 people increased, and they were all foreigners. Although some British people also joined, the number was similar to those who left, which indicates that it is not easy to increase the number of people.</p>
<p>Individual Situations of Production in Various Industries</p>
<p>The individual situations of production in various industries last year were roughly as follows: The production of vehicles was very good. Based on the production volume of passenger cars in the first eleven months of 1948, there will be 335,000 vehicles in a year, which is 17% higher than in 1947. Commercial military vehicles were 170,000 vehicles, which is 10% higher than in 1947. The ships completed were 950,000 net tons in 1947, and exceeded 1.2 million net tons in 1948. The export target of coal has also been achieved, but the output has not reached the expected level, so between 1.5 million tons and 2 million tons of coal from inventory were used.</p>
<p>Intelligence Case Murderer Zhang Jimin Escorted to Xishi</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Wuxi 1st Dispatch] Zhang Jimin, the murderer in the love murder case, has been captured in Shanghai and was escorted to Xishi last night.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] A major case of robbery of five families occurred in Tianji浜 No. 12 in the city last night, and the losses were quite large. It is reported that the thugs were all wearing yellow clothes.</p>
<p>Brief News</p>
<p>Guilin</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Dispatch] The corruption case of Chen Jianxiao, the president of National Guangxi University, has been accused by the professors of the school of four major crimes: (1) Embezzling gasoline, reporting less and more; (2) Oil drum malpractice; (3) Forging seals to sell school bus tickets; (4) Inflating firewood, reporting less and more when reimbursing. The Guilin Office of the Guangdong-Guangxi Supervisory Office has now checked the school's account books and cashier's account books for November and December of last year, and the truth of the case will be revealed soon.</p>
<p>Wuxing</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Dispatch] More than 260 refugees from Funing, Subei, bringing their old and supporting their young, came to Huzhou from Zhenjiang. They asked the local authorities for relief at Ximen in this county. The town office provided them with funds and they went to neighboring counties.</p>
<p>A Snapshot of Jiaxing  Our reporter Chen Jianxiong</p>
<p>Jiaxing - In this era of war and chaos, it has not been involved in the vortex of war. On the surface, it is indeed a paradise in the war. But the surface prosperity still cannot conceal the internal emptiness. After eight years of catastrophe, it is still unable to break free from the indirect impact of the war.</p>
<p>The economic turmoil has made the treatment of public teachers without a certain standard. The salaries they receive really make it impossible for them to live. Therefore, the primary school teachers first launched a petition, and the local newspapers also wrote articles to appeal. Finally, it was passed at the ninth conference, relieving the siege of life and distress.</p>
<p>The councilors are very concerned about the lives of the primary school teachers, but because they are too concerned, they made a joke. When the ninth conference decided to send representatives to the county magistrate to request that the balance of the salaries for primary school teachers from August to November be paid in full within a week, the county magistrate agreed and ordered the relevant department to rush to make the roster overnight and notify the schools to claim it. Who knew that the maximum balance salary for each teacher was only ten yuan, but the round-trip travel expenses from the countryside to the county town cost twenty or thirty yuan. Some townships were too far from the county to rush back, and there were also problems with food and accommodation, which made everyone laugh and cry.</p>
<p>The suffering of public teachers is not as much as the suffering of public teachers who are cultural people. When prices were at their peak, it was not enough to buy a pack of black market "white tin-wrapped" cigarettes with a month's salary. Although the editors and reporters association later invited the heads of various newspapers to request an increase, it was two times lower than that of public teachers. It is still too hopeless whether it is possible to adjust it in the future.</p>
<p>The public security work in Jiaxing has indeed achieved a level of ensuring safety. In recent months, not only has there not been a single case of theft, but even small cases of theft have been rarely discovered.</p>
