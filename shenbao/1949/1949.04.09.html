<h3>總統官邸深夜會商　和談屆臨重要階段　政府拒絕限期移交軍權</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕和談屆臨重要階段。今後數日，將決定和平是否能趨實現，抑雙方仍將以兵戎相見。樂觀人士雖於若乾困難事實中，覓得其樂觀之根據，但和談所遭遇之難關，顯為不可否認者。某權威人士八日晚對記者指出：（一）共軍要求於和談期間，卽行渡江；（二）李代總統致電毛澤東氏，重申謀和決心；（三）何應欽忽忽由穗返京；（四）白崇禧應召由漢來京；（五）由本平來京之三代表，在京之活動等跡象，均應予以重視，據稱：政府代表在平興中共代表初步洽談，卽發覺雙方之間頗有影響。另一緻結為八項條件中之第一項懲辦戰犯問題，中共堅持八條件原則不變，僅允放寬尺度，政府則認為應為人民打算，只須着重今後問題，不必過事追究過去責任。李代總統於此和談重要階段逕電毛澤東氏，坦率陳述和談困難焦點所在，願以一身承當，目的卽在先求對此項問題之協議與諒解，俾和談能順利進行。至渡江改編軍隊及未來之政府問題，李代總統電中所述遵孫總理遺囑國共合作，並與各民主人士共同負責，努力建國，其意蓋在如和談成功，各方人士合組聯合政府，則軍隊問題卽可迎刃而解。何應欽飛穗主要目的，為聽取黨內人士對和談之意見，留穗兩日，卽匆匆返京，白崇禧亦於同日應李代總統之召，由漢來京，顯示八日晚京中將有重大決定。此項決定，亦與北平來京之三代表而須於九日或十日返平一事有密切關係，該人士預料整個和談局勢，將於二三日內有決定性發展。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕據悉：在北平進行之和談正式會議，八日尚未開始，政府代表團八日晚集何應欽，閻錫山，白崇禧，吳忠信，童冠賢會商和談問題，迄九日晨一時許始散。</p>
<p>代總統致毛澤東電</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕李代總統於七日夜十一時致電毛澤東，原文如次：「張長官文白兄轉潤之先生有道，自宗仁主政以來，排除萬難，決心謀和，悱惻之忱，諒貴黨各位民主人士所共亮登。今屆和談伊始，政府代表既已遵邀蒞平，協談問題亦已採納貫方所提八條為基礎，宗仁凜於戰禍之慘酷，蒼生之憔悴，更監於人類歷史演成之錯語，因以慮及和談困難之焦點，願秉已飢已溺之懷，更作進一步之表示，凡所謂之歷史錯誤，足以妨礙和平，如所謂戰犯也者，縱有湯各民主人士共負努力建設新中國之使命，況復世界風雲日益詭譎，國共合作，尤為迫切，如彼此同守此義，其他問題，便可迎刃而解，宗仁何求，今日所冀，惟化干戈為玉帛，登斯民於袵席，耿耿此心，有如白水，特電佈悃，諸希亮豋，弟李宗仁卯（四月）陽（七日）印。」</p>
<h3>訪晤南來神秘客　與本報記者長談一時半</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八電〕五日由劉仲容陪同來京之三位人士，對和談問題之重要性，已於三日來之發展中獲得證實。此三人士在京行動極為神秘，官方人士對此諱莫如深，目前可以透露者，為該三人士係代表三個不同之立場，其中一人為李濟琛代表李民欣氏，另一人據稱自身身份甚高，有其個人之地位，係以個人身份從事和平運動，與李民欣及其他一人並無任何關係，此三氏在京被目為政治空氣中之神秘人物，但彼此除曾在代總統七日晚之宴會中同席外，並無聚會，惟在記者三日苦追之中所獲之得成果，已瞭然於彼等之政治環境，故其神秘在記者心中除不便代為宣布其姓名外，已成為重要之政治性矣。八日深夜要求在某一並非官衙邸之屋宇中訪晤三人士中之一不願宣布姓名之某氏，達一小時又半之談話，使記者能獲悉三人士在和談中之努力與成就，某氏身份甚高，曾為林森·李濟琛·顧祝同等之師友，有一貫之和平主張，渠於北平「局部和平」後赴平，此次南來係「代表其個人」，為救人民求和平而來。某氏一再表示渠與同來人士元關。據稱：渠在專機內與其他人士未交一言，下機後乘迎接之汽車離開機場，中餘卽音獨下車，在夫子願小店吃麵及理髪，並未為人注意。某氏着藍布長袍，中等身材，年齡在五十左右，雙目炯然，執杖而行，精神極佳，當渠於八日深夜返其寓邸發現記者時，頗現驚詫之神情。渠對記者所詢實際問題起，均避不作答，並綜合一小時半之談話，可以為讀者告者，乃某氏來京為和平奔走之意見中，包括代總統對毛澤東通電之意義，此為三日來之成就，但並非其目的。彼等將繼績努力達成和平目的。某氏並稱：如不達目的不至於十一日前返平，詢以此種目的是否可以達成，某氏稱，將視大家努力。在某氏之談話中，顯示和談這困難甚大，但同時顯示和平並未絕望。渠於五日抵京後，會於六日晚應李代總統邀，長談二小時，七日復應李代總統邀宴，與其他二人士同席。此外，渠與在京要員，亦接見甚頻，顧祝同八日午會設宴招待</p>
<h3>共軍旬內渡江說　觀察家認不可能</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕近二三日來，由於京中盛傳共黨已向政府提出最後通牒，一般人士以為共軍在十日之內或將渡江進軍南下，顯已引起京滬及其他政府地區之緊張反應，而原定週六返京之行政院長何應欽，亦特提前於今日由穗返京，此點似更說明政府必須在短促時限內，對共方所提之要求，作一重大決定。就事實而論，自三月廿四日共軍揭開安慶攻略戰以來，東起儀徵，西迄漢口，共軍之攻略國事江北橋頭堡行動，卽已開始執行；除共軍之安慶攻勢遭政府軍隊之遏阻而受頓挫外，其在安慶以東之長江北岸地區，經兩週來時日之排演，共軍業已吞吃了棕楊，劉家渡，土橋，儀徵等四處軍略據點。目下除安慶以西，僅華陽鎮橋頭堡一地已被共軍吞吃，其餘據點均仍無恙，而安慶以東者僅有蕪湖對岸之二壩，裕溪鎮，當塗對岸之西梁山，南京對岸之兩浦地區，鎮江北岸之瓜州以及揚中北岸之口岸鎮，江陰北岸之六圩港七處橋頭堡，迄今在國軍手中。據軍方觀察：卽使有外間所傳說之共黨通牒榮已送交政府，而共軍之實際事行動，如在全綫渡江前，僅欲拿下上述七處橋頭堡，亦需如同過去化二週時間，方能予以攻佔。此則尚屬衹論安慶以東者而言。再就九江對岸，小池口以西，直至漢口之共軍而論，雖曾一度進抵距漢不及九十華里之黃陂車站，但旋卽北退於距漢口卅英里半徑之外圍地帶。所以，從軍事形勢觀察，除非國軍內部發生突變，可以使得共軍渡江很易得手之外，否則，決沒有理由，可以預定共軍在十日內渡江能成事實，中共電台日來雖一再強調共軍將向江南進攻，而其實際作用，實政治性重於軍事性。今日湯總部蔡名永副參謀長，為實地查勘陣勢，特於下午親駕飛機前往鎮江以東之長江下游的和尚洲上空從事空中視察，判明外間謠傳共軍駕木排操小舟將由該處大舉渡江之說，完全不確。再者，根據軍方所得情報，亦早已提供了共軍在江北岸結集船隻兵馬，乃為事實。其中尤以在皖江北岸集湖以南集聚的木船，為數約在一萬隻左右，人馬約在十萬以上。此種情形，則確係特別令人警惕者。據專家判斷所得，此種軍事形勢，以及國軍方而零星的小叛變，如板橋嘉與等事件，自不免使得和談的國軍方面，心理上受到若干波動，但倘若和談雙方決心談得下去，此種表面上的形勢，亦不過乃鴻門宴上的舞劍插曲而已。</p>
<h3>毛澤東同意在和談期間　停止攻擊政府宣傳攻勢　已通知政工人員不播剌激詞句</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕據接近李代總統人士八日透露：毛澤東應政府和談代表團之請，已同意在和談期間停止「宣傳進攻」，並經令飭政工人員於廣播中避免攻擊政府及政府人員之剌激詞句，毛氏此項諾言，已由張治中於七日深夜電告李代總統。早在政府代表抵平之初，與共方人士接觸時，政府代表卽提及此事。毛氏當時曾表示批評政府之尖刻字句，係政工人員所為，與中共當局談和無涉。惟為避免過份剌激，故毛氏有此決定。該人士並稱：中共此項諾言，是否實現，吾人可於後新華社廣播獲得事實之證明。</p>
<h3>蘇北緊張儀徵失陷　隔岸砲聲鎮江清晰可聞　江浦國軍克高麗店共軍攻勢受挫</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江八日電〕蘇北孤城儀徵，七日夜八時許在共軍猛烈砲火攻擊下，終於一時棄守。緣共軍砲位設於城北胥浦橋，重砲五門，於八時正開始向城內及泗源溝江面發砲達一百餘發，五時許，縣府中彈起火，南門外大碼頭數處亦起大火。斯時共軍一千餘人，卽攻入西門，北門外守軍聞訊卽達回城內增援，亦已不及阻擋。旋發生慘烈巷戰，左治人縣長督率保安團隊衝出包圍圈，退守南門（距離泗源溝四華里），不料共軍一部由西門攻入後，卽分兵進駐城東南沙漫洲守軍陣地，控制泗源溝江面，左縣長卽突出南門，沿泗源溝公路搜索共軍，行至儀泗橋，中途卽與共軍發生遭遇戰，經激戰後，左縣長下落不明。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江八日電〕共軍攻陷儀徵，八日拂曉，卽對三汷河。施家橋。十二圩一帶動攻勢，隆隆砲聲，此間整日清晰可聞，室內玻窗均為搖撼震動。揚（州）六（合）線戰事今已南移至施家橋南五里之朱家旗桿與老四圩附近，國軍陣地無恙，現南岸國軍正星夜渡江向六圩。瓜洲。十二圩等地增援。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江八日電〕儀徵泗業洲位於十二圩與高資中間，四面環水，為一孤島型態勢，現該縣保安第二團團長樊希轅正率部嚴陣以待，惟糧彈兩缺，昨已急電省方從速接濟。又，十二圩情勢趨緊。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江八日電〕省府丁主度，駐鎮第四軍王軍長，省保安楊副司令，八日下午二時乘惠安砲艇赴瓜洲。十二圩一帶佈署江防，并指示機宜，五時返鎮。</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州八日電〕蘇北局勢驟緊，蘇省府日內聞將自鎮遷蘇辦公。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江八日電〕此間當局今宣佈江北岸軍情緊張，鎮瓜綫通航自卽晶暫停。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京八日電〕鎮江來電：軍界人士謂進攻儀徵之共軍，携有一〇五公厘口徑砲至少十一尊，足以切斷長江交通，其大砲射程甚至可達南岸鎮江南京間之鐵路綫。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕軍聞社訊：江浦國軍於七日上午一舉收復高麗店，共軍吳化三十五軍攻勢受挫，稍向後退。</p>

<h3>漢外圍壓力日重　國軍集中兵力搆成堅強陣地　安慶上空發現共軍飛機投彈</h3>
<p>〔本報孝感八日電〕全長一一二四公里之平漢鐵路，國軍現緊握迫近終點之七十三公里，兵力業已迅速集中於漢口北東西三面，搆成堅強之弧形陣地，此一態勢已說明國軍具有確保大武漢之信心，局勢雖已臨嚴重階段，但孝感以南心尚不過分慌張。</p>
<p>〔本報孝感八日電〕軍息：平漢綫孝感以北當面鐵路西兩側共軍對漢口外圍之壓力目見加重，昨晚十時後，共軍第十縱隊廿九旅兩個團，一度越過蕭家港，績向南竄，旋經國軍莫師某部奮勇擊退，孝感附近居民會隱聞砲聲聲，據悉：平漢當面共軍主力一部約一萬人，已到達廣水迄花園之綫鐵路西側，安陸應城間共軍江漢縱隊一部正向東移動，孝感西鄉居民業已逃避一空。</p>

<h3>何院長返抵首都　離穗前曾致訓勗勉僚屬　刻苦從公加強行政效率</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕行政院長何應欽八日下午三時半乘自強號專機自穗飛返京，內長李漢魂等同來，政院秘書黃少谷，副院長賈景德，經長孫越崎，國防部長徐永昌，及端木傑等均至機場迎接，記者曾詢何代以在穗舉行之中常會情形，以及黨內擬為對和談問題籌組之指導委會則已付討論，結果如何不悉，何氏旋卽邀黃少谷同車而去。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州八日電〕何院長八日晨八時十五分接見在穗國代，彼等提出意見：（一）請改善公教人員待遇，（二）安置裁併人員，（三）選賢用能，何氏已允予考慮。九時氏假迎賓館茶會招待在穗立監委及國民黨中委，文泛交換意見，至十時十分在政院辦公處召集司長以上人員訓話，略謂：國家當此困難之際，力勉各員必須忍耐，刻苦從公，加強行政效率。今後政院政務重心在京，事務在穗，唯極力使其不失聯絡，至裁併人員自有適當處理辦法。何氏訓話畢為十時四十分，卽驅車赴天河機場，仍乘自強號專機於十一時離穗飛返京，李漢魂，王俊等同行。</p>
<h3>中常會曾檢討　政府外交政策　一貫方針絕對不應有何變動　政俯將組和平指導會</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州七日電〕（遲到）七日中政會後隨卽舉行一人一次中常會，首由何應欽院長報告軍事，其中包括共軍進攻平漢路南段及安慶，儀微等地情形，並報告政府代表到平後數日經過情況及財政金融情形，後由外次葉公超報告國際情勢，一般對共軍進攻情形常重視，會中熱烈討論，大致認為舉行和談後，雙方應卽停戰，免使人民再受戰禍，一般希望共黨能接納政府停戰議，以表示對和談誠意。同時，對政府外交政策亦有慎重檢討，咸認自抗戰以來，在國際上與一切民主國家合作，參加聯合國機構，共同努力世界和平，此一貫外交方針甚洽當，絕對不應何變動，故中政會對傳秉常長外交雖予追認，但絕非政府改變外交方針。該會議後，紛論及最近中共廣播主張團結國人，凖備參加蘇聯集團作戰一點，認此乃完全違反國人愛好和平意志。最後各委員對和談問題交換意見，直至下午六時散會。至詳細內容未能獲悉，惟聞大體將以共軍是否願意停戰及是否仍欲渡江為和談成功之關鍵，並聞政府將根據此項原則，並組和平指導委員會，以便和平代表請示時，隨時指示機宜。</p>

<h3>社論　財金改革案之修正</h3>
<p>財政金融改革案的修正案，巳經送到立法院去完成立法程序；我們讀完了上項修正的改革案之後，對於新任財政部長劉攻芸氏的財金政策，大體上巳獲得了一個輪廓。</p>
<p>財金政策的內容，仍是沿襲着徐可亭氏財金改革新方案的老路，但其中亦有顯著的差異，即在於下列各點：（一）國庫不再貼補交通及公用事業（二）創立「稅元」單位制，每稅元合市制黃金一分，以金圓券換購：（三）籌辦財產稅；（四）酌辦生產貸款。（五）舉辦生活指數存軟或其他保値存款。現在我們再根據這幾點分別加以檢討。</p>
<p>政府補貼政策實行得最為廣泛而有效的，要推戰時的英國，當時英國物資缺乏，不得不極力增加生產，和爭購進口物資，而因爭產和爭購所支付的額外費用，又不應攤在賈價以內，致為低級收入者所不能負擔，因之即實行補貼制度。至於我國，目前交通公用事業補貼的情形，就不能與英國相提並論了，按我國補貼的範圍，計有郵電，鐵道，飛機，輪船，公路客車，公共汽車，電話，電車，電力，煤氣，輪渡，自來水等，以上享用的階級，雖有一部份是眞正收入少，負擔重的人民，（尤其是公敎人員）但如飛機，煤氣，電報，電話，以及鐵道，輪船等的頭二等客票，大都是中產階級以上的人所享用，今日如果還要拿一般生活困苦平民的血汗，來補貼他們的享用，當然問心有愧的！所以我們很同意取消補貼制度，而應達到各單位的自給自足。不過交通公用事業各主管在酌定收費標準的時候，最好加重頭等享受的負擔，而津貼低等享受的平民，俾使大多數人民能有享用交通公用事業的機會。</p>
<p>其次，談到一稅元」問題，這是一個新的體制，規定每一單位等於黃金一分，專作納稅之用，這和一關元」繳進口稅，有異曲同工之妙，而關係人民的生的生活，更為鉅大。因為進口貨物並非一般平民所能享受的，其用「關元」計算繳納，對於人民生活的影響，究屬尙小，而一切稅捐若完全用「稅元」來繳納的話，那恐怕就非中等以下人民所能負擔得了的了！這一措施的產生，工商界固然還有轉嫁的餘地，但是每月拿進金圓券的薪水階級和升斗小民們，如何忍受得了？國家的捐稅，固然要求到「確實」的程度，但如　不到人民負擔的能力，則無吳「殺鷄取蛋」，其結果仍是造成更多人的貧窮，和社會秩序的紛擾，絕不是妥當的辦法·况且嚷到今天的財產稅，還在「籌」辦之中，我們甚望當局能趕悏拿出魄力來，本著有錢出錢的公平原則，不要讓那許多豪富們「逃避」納稅的義務，而負擔全落在平民的身上。</p>
<p>再次，關於舉辦生活指數存款或其他保値存款一點，我們認為前者在目前絕非良好的機宜，人民過去對於黃金儲蓄强迫扣獻四成的刺激，至現在記憶猶新，戰前存款及公債的償還辦法，到現在也還沒有獲得公平合理的解決，若這許多前提不能打消的話，恐怕人民決不　輕易入彀的；再說到「生活指數」四個字，在人民　印象中，也許並不良好，目前專為公敎人員編裂的生活指數，純操在政府的掌握裏，己是人所共知，即是各地職工的生活指數，何嘗不為？計算的技術問題，常常發生工潮？所以在這種環境之下，要談到辦理生活指數存款問題，絕對不易得到人民的支持。至於後者，亦即目前各方盛傳的銀元存款，我們對於銀元存款雖不敢寄予多大的奢望，但顯然比前者要具體得多，因為（一）銀元在民間的印象極為深刻普徧，而且各地的交易巳不乏用銀元作為籌碼。（二）銀元單位，與戰前每一元之購買力相似，收付極為靈使。（三）銀元有公開之市塲及價格，絕非如物價指數之抽象，（四）蘭州·昆明·長沙各地銀行已普徧的施行銀元存放款業務，福州·湖南各省市的政費收支，亦有用銀元為單位的。目前政府如能適應濫用流，為時勢而轉變的話，則辦理銀元存款，顯然有助於當前　經濟政策，不過所顧慮的，即是目前多數銀行家為自身利益的打算，而顯出畏縮之態。</p>
<p>最後，我們對於酌辦生產貸款的意見，巳在上月三十一日本報的社論，貢獻了八項原則，希望當局能仔細的加以考慮，我們不希望這次的生產貸款僅為了敷衍少數工業資本家的要求，也不希望一具文」式的貸款條文，我們希望在辦理貸款之後，即能眞正幫助正當的生產事業，那麼才可以收到增加物資，平抑物價的效果，而充分達到貸款的精神。</p>
<p>綜上所論，我們以為當前的財金政策，應該有個具體的打算，決不可頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，而政策尤須側重在實際的精神方面，俾能獲得最大的效能。在政府財金政策失盡人心，失盡信用的今日，當局似宜從速辦理銀元存款，以作為恢復信用，收拾人心的張本，從而奠定財政金融的新基礎。</p>

<p>〔本報南京八日電〕立法院第三會期第十二次會議，八日晨九時半舉行，童冠賢主席，報吿事項：政院咨請審議行政院主計處組織法草案，決定交法制委會，財金委會聯席審查。政院咨請審議修正內政部組織法草案，決定交內政及地方自治委會，法制委會聯席審查，並請勞工，地政，社會，衛生四委會各推委員一人參加。政院咨為擬具財政金融改革案修正草案。請查照審議案，決定交財政金融委會審查。討論事項：首討論簡化省級行政機構之審查報吿，各委員紛紛發言，意見不一，最後決定交內政及地方自治委會及法制委會重付審查，於一週內提出院會討論。王定聲等所提郵政法與國營事業管理法矛盾，提議修正郵政法案，決議照程序委會意見，交交通委會，法制委會聯席審查。旋討論王力航所提為現時國家行局庫會機構龐大，業務重複，糜費浩繁，組織極不合理，影響國計民生金融物價最為重大，特擬具改革國家金融機構辦法，澈底改組行局庫，樹立合法之銀行制度，根絕豪門買辦之把持，挽救經濟崩潰之危機，以解救饑寒交迫之人民案，該案原文甚長，宣讀時間過久，時已近午，決定午後繼續討論，十二時散會。</p>
<p>下午三時半續會，合併討論王力航所提改組國家行庫局案及武誓彭等所提改革銀行制度，以謀國計民生之發展案，辯論甚久，決仍分案交財政金融委會及法制委會聯席審查，束雲章等所提捩請裁撤輸出入管理委員會，以資簡化，而節公帑案，各委員發言時，幾成同意裁撤意見，當經決定交付經濟資源委會，財政金融委會及法制委會聯席審查，至六時散會。</p>
<h3>有關金融提案　激烈辯論情形</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕王力航所提改革國家金融機構，澈底改組國家行局庫案及武誓彭所提改革銀行制度案，八日下午立院大會中提出討論，引起一塲激烈爭辯，原提案人及大部立委對於國家行局庫多年來之弊端及操縱金融等現象，多表不滿，咸主應予澈底改革。仲肇湘根據事實及理論，認為國家各行局有其存在價値，提出相反意見，引起會塲中一塲激辯。討論時，首由提案人王力航，武誓彭分別說明提案理由及意見，主張應卽於限期內討論完成，不可再事拖延。王·武說明畢，卽由梁棟首先發言，謂國家行局之罪惡，乃為人所共知：（一）國家行局之支出，不受國家預算之限制；（二）國家行局之人事，不受銓敍部之銓敍；（三）國家行局之帳目表，並未送交審計部·主計；（四）國家行局之機構，並不屬於財部，而其所作所為，則多為囤積居奇，操縱金融，一切皆由皇親國戚及大戶所把持，如不撤底改革，則國家·政府·人民均無希望。仲肇湘認為，金融機構之令人不滿，乃人同此心，惟足以影饗金融者，其因素有四：（一）金融政策；（二）金融制度；（三）人事與管理；（四）外在的因素。吾人檢討金融機構時，應根據四因素進行，不可僅以一項因素槪括其餘。王委負將金融機構之腐化均歸之於制度，實太忽略其他因素，今日世界金融之趨勢，均趨向於專業化，蘇聯亦實行銀行專業化制度，故對於王委員所提兼業化之主張，實巳與今日之趨勢不合，主張審查此案時應根據上述之基本看法，而王案中主張取消商業銀行，無異否認工商業之存在，而囤積等現象亦多由於外在因素，不可因噎廢食。仲肇湘發言甫畢，王力航卽再度起立發言，大呼我們要拿出立委的身份，不能代表資本家說話，並認為仲委員所言四點，實際上只是一點，卽金融制度問題，請問我們的國家行局是一種什麼制度。苗啟平繼王後發言，渠激動高呼：我們的血已經讓國家行局吸光了，如再不澈底改革，一切都將無救，劉全忠對王案表示贊成，但主張應有部分修正。至此，童院長當卽起立，主將此案交付審查，話猶未畢，王力航卽怒指童院長謂：「主席，我要向你提出嚴重警吿，每次討論此案時，你都說交付審查，難道是你同銀行界有往來嗎」？饅後，張靜馬提議，兩案分別交付審查，當經無異議通過。</p>

<h3>西德三佔領區逐步合併　美英法簽訂協定　西德政府六十日內成立　准參加馬歇爾援區計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕英美法三國外長貝文·艾契遜·許曼，在此數度討西德問題後，已於今日簽訂三國關於西德之正式協定。其內容已於卽日在倫敦·華盛頓·巴黎·柏林四地同時公布。要點有如下述：</p>
<p>（一）西德英美兩合併區與法國區在管制上之充籌，以及逐步解除西德三佔領區間之界綫。（二）在今後兩個月內設立西德國。（三）西德三佔領軍間軍事責任的趨於一致。（四）繼績英美空運接濟柏林之制度，必要時並得使用法區之空運站。（五）西德三區間及對外貿易之統籌。（六）認西德為大西洋公約之一份子。</p>
<p>此一協定為趨向實現西德國的一重大進展，其對荷比盧三國之重要意義，已由英美法三國聯合知照荷比盧。國務院發言人特別指出該約成立迅速之特點，認為若在普通情形之下，該協定之談判必須經相當時日，約須在五月下旬始有簽字可能。其得以迅速須利成立之原因，當在大西洋公約之成立及國際局勢之急遽惡化。英方人士亦承認協定之迅速成立，顯示大西洋公約對國際關係所具之重要作用，今後歐洲發展期將視大西洋公約為其鎖錀，而三區就西德所訂之協定亦無疑的將為西方國家間建起締結其他協定的先驅。</p>

<h3>市商會電請財政部　放寬票據抵用禁令</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會昨電財政部，請放寬標據不得當日抵用禁令，電云：南京財政部鈞鹽，據本市魚商業同業公會函稱，查近日來本市金融當局突宣布禁止票據當日抵用，而高利貸又創空前紀錄，各業市場均陷停頓狀態，金融情形極度混亂，各業影響所及，痛苦不堪。本會據各會員行，紛紛來會訴苦，卽經召開臨時理監事緊要會議，僉以情勢惡劣，如不迅謀補救之方，則本市工商業，均有全部閉門之虞，決議函請商會，迅籌對策，以解商困等語。由該公會轉函到會，同時其他各業以上述情形，來會伸訴者亦復絡繹不絕。查邇來現鈔奇缺，中央銀行對於商業行荘之提用存款，衹能供給現鈔百分之十二，定額本票百分之八，商業行荘，卽以此數發給客戶，是工商業與行荘有往來者，縱使有十足之頭寸，存於行荘，亦衹能取得其所需要十分之二。工商在此情形之下，以自已之確實頭寸，開發票據，作為支付工具，確有其迫切需要，今乃突於嚴重情勢之下，澈底執行其當日不得抵用禁令，無異扼工商業之咽喉，置之死地。當時局緊張，工商業閉門待盡之時，更與上年頒布票據不得當日抵用之際，夷險不同，張馳逈別，政貴因時，詎能墨守令甲，不為工商業稍留餘地。應請鈞部令知上海金融管理局，對於商業行荘之票據抵用，留有彈性之自由，不為極端之禁止，應由各行荘斟酌客戶情形，自行審慎辦理，對於退票除規定之二十七項理由外，更應防制其巧立名目，任意輕退。同時對於發票客戶，予以嚴格制裁，庶足維持票據信用，而工商業仍得資以週轉。又近年以來，游資分散，商業行荘以資力薄弱，不能供給工商業之需要，中央銀行亦未能盡其銀行之銀行責任，以致工商業有所需求，每一元之貸款，利息最高之時，動在行荘拆息兩三倍以上，飲酖並非自甘，勢實出於無奈，必須由鈞部切商中央銀行，能盡其銀行之銀行責任，供給商業行荘以充沛資金，庶行荘拆息，可以逐漸回抑，而市場利息，亦不致大肆猖獗。為解除工商業疾苦起見，謹貫其一得之愚，仰祈鈞部監核，採納施行。上海市商會叩卯庚。</p>

<h3>金雞湖沉屍案　撲朔迷離·翻雲覆雨　真相判明·四犯處死</h3>
<p>— 楊繡口</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州五日訊〕本年一月一日晚上，此間葑門外金雞湖發生了一件殺人趙貨的大血案。一漁船被劫，船上男女四人，都被強盜勒斃後，沉屍湖中。事後，刑警隊多方偵緝，捕獲主犯孫福樓等四人，經嚴訊後，各犯都供認不諱，當局凖備以極刑時，不料忽有名張拾子者，投地院自首，謂真正主犯並非孫福樓等，實在是做刑警眼綫的王兆民·李同發二人，致使全案推翻，但開庭提審時，張拾子郤又悔前供，如此翻雲覆雨，撲朔迷離，一時轟動三吳。本月一日開末一庭時，旁聽席上座無隙地，都想一睹這殺人兇犯之面目。現把本案前後詳情探誌於後：</p>
<p>住居葑門外漁商張新生·王阿二·祝伯青·姚錫明·朱福生·甄連生等六人，平日以合夥經營魚蝦為生，經常往來於蘇漢一帶，元旦日在葑門外街朝天朝十七號仁昌行內，購得鮮魚廿餘斤，蝦二百八十斤，價值一萬餘金圓，裝成四籐包，倔得李金南之木船裝載，並由股東張新生·王阿二·二人負責押運去蘇州火車站，轉赴上海脫售。船主由其妻妹徐林妹幫同搖船。該船下行六時許開出，惟船至第二天仍未見歸來，船主李金南之母，遂前往仁昌魚行問訊，亦不知消息，於是各處找尋，直至一月三日沿金雞湖找至蔣巷河附近，才發現元且搖出之船，船上僅遺留帽子三頂，女鞋一雙，而船主李南·徐林妹及漁商張新生·王阿二四人，已不知去向，情知不妙，卽返漁行報告，該行卽雇員赴金雞湖察看，據附近居民稱：二日間曾有漁船捕魚時發覺巨重物件，以為大魚，遂將鉤分別鉤起，原來人屍四其，船戶見狀大驚，不敢聲張，唯恐殃及自身，仍將屍體擲沉水中。事為漁商股東祝伯青等得悉，四日卽雇船打撈一天，一無所獲，五日再僱船多艘，以滾鉤打撈，至下午二時許，始在湖中撈起屍體二具，認清為漁商押船之張新生及王阿二，兩屍面部浮之張新生及王阿二，兩屍面部浮腫青紫，並有用手抓破之傷痕，全身被麻繩綑綁，頸部亦用麻繩勒緊，其狀慘不忍睹，顯係勒死後沉屍滅跡。七日繼績打撈，李金南·徐林妹兩屍亦撈獲。此二屍比前兩屍更慘，兩被被綑綁在一起。該案發生後，八日幹警探得綫索，帶同眼綫王兆民·李同發下鄉在唯亭正儀捕穫山東客籍案內重犯孫金香（叩梅）·孫小媚·吳金祥等三人，尚有餘黨在車坊·角直等處，刑警再出發前往偵捕，至九日又捕獲起意生犯孫福樓，尚有餘黨，唐連生·孫行桃二人在逃未弋獲。該四犯狡滑異常，堅不吐露真情，旋由蘇更生隊長設法命幹警將孫叩梅帶往後園空地，喝令側臥地上，再用破舊棉衣蓋上，偽裝死狀，並向地開放二槍，嗣後再將孫小梅·吳金祥等帶入，稱倒地之孫犯已奉令槍決等語，三犯見狀後，全身抖動不止，乃對全案行兇，直認不諱，供出因孫等搶刦時，巧遇張新生等多是認識的，因此意圖滅口，刑警隊據供後，卽將帶同案犯下鄉吊取原臓皮袍等物，至此全案已水落石出。警局吳局長對該四兇犯罪大惡極，決處極刑，並擬呈報第一綏靖區司令部核准後，予以槍決，以快人心。</p>
<p>詎該案至二月十八日，竟發生重大變故，緣該案四犯之妻孫楊氏·孫戴氏等特聯名具呈縣參議會及警局法院等機關呼冤，稱孫福樓等被人誣告，蒙冤入獄，該案主犯卽孫密告人王兆民·李同發兩人，因有私仇，故移花接木，借此報復，凡孫等被捕後，王兆民曾夥同自稱刑警人員王老二，李同發連續將孫戴氏·孫楊氏等姦宿等語，一方面請求法院將孫等提審。同日忽有另一船戶張拾子者，投地檢處自首，謂刑警隊所獲之孫福樓等四犯，實為冤枉，真正的兇犯確係王兆民，李同發及另有不知姓名者，三人因那天張拾子給他們捉去搖船的。經潘檢察官訊問後，暫行收押，因與前案恰巧相反，卽電請刑警隊將王·李二人帶案偵查。據李同發稱：「我平日與孫小梅感情素好，去年陰暦一月初六，曾向孫借金圓劵四百元，孫稱手頭無款，至初七，孫小梅卽將四百元借我，至十一日將款還孫時，孫說該款可不必還了，最近銷去了一批鮮蝦，手中甚為寬裕，其時我問孫一向只捕魚，不捉蝦，何故此次有蝦出售。他便告訴我，在金雞湖河中開了一批生意，故知此案實為孫所幹。」此案此乃告奇峯突起，一波三折，令人感到撲朔迷離，是非莫辨，雖數度偵查，真相亦殊難剖明。</p>
<p>三月七日本案又開庭繼績偵查，竟獲到了重大發展，緣當檢察官單獨審訊張拾子時，張在供詞愚，進牢後，孫楊氏等對他的賣命錢一點也不付給他，他才生漸悔意，吐露直相，至此，這案情迷離的大血案。才真正的大白了</p>
<p>法院方面卽分三方面進行，孫福樓等六人（二人在逃）。以盜匪罪提起公訴外，王兆民·李同發被孫唐氏控告強迫輪姦妨害風化部份另行繼績偵查，張拾子誣告部份亦依法提起公訴。經三月三十一日及四月一日二庭審訊後，　因罪證確實，已宣告終結。終四月四日宣判：「孫扣梅，孫小媚，吳金祥，孫福樓共同強刦，故意殺人。各自死刑，　奪終身。」</p>

<h3>春風緣透姑蘇城內外　郊區若干勝地尚有寸步荊棘之感</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者楊文育</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州五日訊〕抄一段描繪姑蘇勝蹟的陳套：「蘇州為春秋吳都，扼三江之衝，當五湖之匯，山川韶秀，人物清華，吳王城畔，級柳成畦，齊女門前，清波拍岸，翠袖三千樓上下，姑蘇自古多佳麗，泊楓橋夜半鐘聲，登虎邱聽生公佛法，步靈嚴響展之廊，探鄧尉香雪之梅，東西洞庭，挺秀吳越，俱足動遐思而豁　，他若滄浪亭，獅子林，留元，怡園等，則名苑佳稱。」短短一百餘字，却一網打盡了蘇州的風物勝蹟，然而這些惑人香艷的字眼，除掉僅能憧憬外，你再也不能在今天的蘇州覓到，但蘇州之所以還能在春秋佳節，引吸着如雲仕女，在我看也不過是因為有了些草·木·山·水，似乎還可以給久住都市的人到這裏來享受些清新而已！</p>
<p>戰爭情勢的急轉直下，使一向寗靜的江南天堂也嗅到了火藥味，於是前一陣的逃難熱，像傳染病一樣到處蔓延，飛機·輪船·火車軋不開交，當然，蘇州唯一足以維繫海上仕女的「清新」，也就無人有這樣閒情逸緻來領受了。記得去年此時的京滬綫上，人像浪潮一樣的向蘇州湧來，奇裝異服，柳腰絳唇的海派女子，幾乎有使古老的蘇州社會，掀起革命一般地瘋狂和刺激，流綫型的汽車，駛在這裏僅有的幾條大街上，蘇州像是做了他們手裏鈔票的俘虜，一種刺目的氣燄！</p>
<p>來蘇州的旅客，免不了要光顧這裏的幾爿店家：采芝齊的瓜子糖果，馬詠齊的醬雞醬鴨，松鶴樓吃頓飯，朱鴻興嚐碗麵，像是學校裏的「必修課程」，因此這些店家多少年來一直把這一段買賣作為一年營業中的旺季，實物的銷路，固無正確的統計，但其中聽說朱鴻興麵司同齡人小賬之多，向為蘇州所有吃食館子之冠，可是今年此日的情形，却和往年大相逕庭了，有着特徵似的海派士女，已很少發現在街頭，館子門口的汽囝陣，也消失了昔日雄姿，偶而有些人做做點綴，與其說逗人注目，母寗是蘇州一般商家的悲哀，倒是一班鄉間富農老婦掛着黃布，背了香袋，到處都是，她們上杭州，去常州天寗寺，無錫崇安寺，或者平望篤脰湖，路過蘇州，少不得玄妙觀裏要觀光一番，用鈔只要「殺脫幾隻頭」（銀洋），誰都及不上她們這樣逍遙自在！</p>
<p>近幾百年來，蘇州的梵宮運宇，增加無數，林園宅第，更不可勝計，最初這些林園，都是風流名士，鄉紳遺老們置以自娛的私產，但近年來都加以開放，任人參觀，可惜的是只有人看，沒有人管，更以頻年兵荒馬亂，於是荒蕪的也有，零落的也有，欣賞成了憑弔，蘇州人的懶散性格，在這些地方充分表現了。如果說荒蕪也是一種美，那麼就可以去看看留。滄浪亭，朽木數棟，敗球不堪，怡園的設計精巧，但現在已作了河南大學的校舍，比較起來，還是獅子林的奇趣砌築，因為沒有什麼破壞，還值得一看，春到人間，裏面點綴了些嫩綠彩色，倒亦顯得調和，這幾天的晴朗，給林子裏塞滿了踏青者羣。</p>
<p>實在說，蘇州的好地方，全在郊外，然而很多地方已令人有寸步荊棘之吧，鄧尉探梅本該列入遊程之首，但梅樹為日本人毀去了一半，現在附近玄墓山上設立了臨時中學，穹窿山上不久會駐過邱清泉的幹訓班，青山依舊，風物大殊，再加上地濱太湖，治安是個大問題，本來往返蘇州與光福間的汽車，一天有好幾班，現在只減剩了一班，交通既不方便，遊人也裹足不前，固然化得起鈔票雇小汽車的人有的是，可是攬勝形同探險，就不免要考慮一下了。朋友告訴我，只要局勢平靖，在楊梅紅，枇杷黃的季節，光福，鄧尉是不妨去趟的。城西二十五里的靈巖山，乘汽車經木凟去，只要半小時就可到達，人力車雖也可以往返，但代價要三個袁大頭。前些時，有一批坐了馬車遊木凟的，回來竟碰到了路刦，損失了不少錢財。噲炙人口的木凟石家飯店，聽說營業比往年差得多。至於天平山，還在靈巖之西，僅管它有白雲泉，蓮花洞以及飛來峯頭陀崖等崢嶸奇石，足供遊客登臨，但去靈巖的人已大非昔比，去天平就無疑更差一籌了。</p>
<p>蘇東坡說過：「至蘇州不遊虎邱為欠事」。「地利」使虎邱成為今日遊蘇士女必然光顧的地方，馬車夫在觀前兜生意，虎邱兩個字，喊得最響亮。離城近不論什麼車子多可利用，而且古蹟特別多，給嚮導的人背誦起來，會滔滔不絕，像唐伯虎三笑因緣的起訖；唐代養鶴澗白公堤的廢址；虎邱塔，生公台，點頭石等六朝古物；遠至周，秦遺蹟之劍池，試劍石等，不一而足，歷代帝王，也曾屢屢臨幸。總之虎邱不曾給你厭倦，何況從經濟方便打算，是相當值得的。清明佳節，踏青的人，在虎邱道上肩磨踵接，會擠得你頭昏腦脹，據說年年有此盛況，同時這天幾十輛救火車到虎邱翠　山荘祭掃公墓，就湊得更形熱鬧了，攤販　集，形成了個大商場，數不清的呌化子叮着遊客一步不肯放鬆，賣花女操着吳儂軟語，像牛皮糖一樣纏着你……有着如趕廟集的情趣。</p>

<h3>南潯無聲的鄉村</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州五日訊〕南潯新詩人徐遲會在他的一篇文章裏說：「南潯是一個無聲的鄉村。無聲與寂寞是不可忍耐的。」南潯，在她從前的歷史，是異常輝煌而與盛的，她在遜清之時起，為了包運官鹽發了財，更在各地辦事與當賺了錢，蠶絲又著名於國際，拿回了很多的外匪，她簡直成了財富甲天下的第一個富鎮，大財主有「四角，八牛，七十二條焦黃狗」之稱，其以財產在百萬銀幣以上者，只落得稱為「一狗」，而狗也有七十二條之多。</p>
<p>劉龐張顧</p>
<p>所謂四象，卽是「劉，龐，張，顧」四姓，當年在南潯除了大家競造巨室門牆之外，也競造私人的花園，如劉家造了小運荘，亭，臺，樓，閣，花卉雜陳。龐家就造了宜園，比小運荘規模更大，張家鹽於龐家有了宜園，於是造比龐家再要大的花園，為了題名，也頗費心思，後來想到「適宜」兩字，「適」在「宜」字之上，因名「適園」。顧家於是也造起別具匠心的庭園，劉家鹽於自已的小運荘不免遜色，於是擴告了「南園」。南潯的私人花園，在勾心鬥角之下，有六個之多。</p>
<p>這許多有錢的人家，除了在都市，競造房屋出租，以消化他膨脹着的財富，所以上海著名靜安寺路傍的橫馬路同孚路兩旁房屋，卽為劉家獨力所造，四馬路著名的會樂里，也為劉家獨力營建</p>
<p>看蠶繅絲</p>
<p>南潯本地，出魚，羊，雞，鴨都是大宗的產品。蠶絲有著名的輯里絲，所謂「輯里」就是有個「漾」，水流經七個「漾」，則自然水質甚清，比處所出之絲，脈圓質靱，拿一根絲吊住一個銅錢，可以達五尺多長，談到南潯蠶絲，遠在清同治年間，就有人看蠶繅士絲，洪楊以後，吳與李松筠來南潯携桑秧，蠶種赴日本掉取寬永銅鈿與海帶菜，一九二〇年時，美國特組觀光團到南潯來觀光，這時所有蠶絲都由法去美，後來法國絲襪盛行，每打最高價值在一千五百美金，絲襪織造須絲體勻淨，南潯普遍多為土絲，市場逐漸為日本絲所奪，日本最好的「白尾蠶」種，卽由南潯而去，惜現在南潯失傳了。在南潯絲盛銷外洋的時代，梅恒裕出品的梅牌蠶絲，馳譽國際之間，輯里絲每担要值關銀九百五十兩，也曾到九百九十兩，不過這一時期甚短，不久就跌下來的。盛銷時出口有三萬數千包，美國絲市場假定有十分，而中國要佔七分，到後來跌到八分之一，而每包僅值法幣三百六十元，時在民國二十六年前，南潯售絲爭取外匯外，並且因生種而頗多發財者，因為遠銷，盈利殊多。（未完）</p>

<h3>黃金市價一路上升　國行以二二五萬之價無限制拋售　飾金波動激烈銀樓午後暫停掛牌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市場，交易漸復正常，收解一律以當日本票及申請書。上午開盤平定，為一八九萬，微降至一八八萬六千。中途因頭寸松濫，利多頻傳，一路升達一九〇萬〇一千，再度漲停。瀕午央行又擬大量拋金，但以中·中·交·農四行之本票或現鈔為限，致同業無法接受。午後買賣擯持，交易又陷停頓。上午成交十餘大條，較上日又漲二成場外交易旺盛，波動劇烈，因渡江傳說紛紜，人心忐忑不定。各幫氣淩霄，晨開一九〇萬，一九五萬，一度退至一八八萬，一九三萬，一路直升至二五〇萬，二五五萬午收。午後因央行以二二五萬之價格，無限制拋售，暗中猛出一二千條，漲勢稍　，開盤二四〇萬，二四五萬，步小到二二一萬，二二四萬，收盤微升至二二八萬，二三一萬，較上日軋漲三八萬。隔日加息兩十六萬，喊高到二四四萬，二四七萬。</p>
<p>〔中聯社訊〕黃金市場自四日央行拋金後，迄昨日為止，尚未趨於正軌，緣因一般金號深懼央行再施毒手，故均不願再場內交易，而將易之重心轉移場外，以致市場陷於停頓。場外交易活躍，影響一般物價至钜。昨據有關方面透露，央行以場外交易日趨猖獗，有亂金融，故於金業市場，可能加以相當之改組，務使黃金市場之交易，趨於正軌。聞此項辦法，不日內當可正式公佈。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀樓飾金，因金價波動劇烈，上午變動三次之多，十時掛一八五萬，二〇五萬，十一時升至一九五萬，二一五萬，迄中午又高至二〇五萬，二二五萬。午後因市面混亂，門銷旺盛，進少出多，供求失調，一律暫停掛牌營業。較上日再漲四三萬，飾銀亦升至二萬，二萬五，亦加四千。</p>
<h3>銀元大跳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元套匯，因外埠銀元價低，交易不多，但較之金圓套匯，則尚合算。　幫套出，匯費直過。漢口套出九八元，升水二元。平津套出美金匯款，每百元一元。銀元套匯，因兩地價格參差，亦有以銀元交匯，而對方取美金者，比率為二元對一。此種套匯方式，雖為保持幣值，別開生面之方法，惟做開仍屬零星。又萬縣銀元套匯，匯水以九六七五折交匯。</p>
<p>馬路交易，升降倐忽。晨間尚平，大頭喊三萬四，三萬六，十時光景因金價猛漲，去化活絡，急起直追，瀕午一路穿出四關，高至四萬四千五，四萬五千五。午後交易混亂，一度即達四萬九，五萬一。傍晚浮多有了，稍低至四萬四，四萬六，小頭喊三萬七，三萬九。龍鷹洋喊三萬，三萬二。本票交易，大頭一度高至五萬一，五萬三。午後隔日喊低至四萬七，四萬九，較上日勁跳一萬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日美鈔場外交易仍稀，腳地比黃金硬紮，大額交易沉寂，大多零星進出。晨開三萬九，四萬一，低至三萬八，四萬，午收高至五萬三，五萬五，午後開盤五萬二，五萬四，降至四萬九，五萬一收盤。較上日軋高九百，隔日加息三千五，喊至五萬二千五，五萬四千五。</p>
<h3>場外喊價一片混亂　米市場昨無做開　麵粉食油漲勢不可收拾</h3>
<p>米市因限價之故，產地及業外各物猛漲，貨主不能按限價交易，故市場交易無形停頓。郊區米價因產地價高，及金鈔面物俱漲，喊價猛升，幾呈混亂。白粳薄稻喊二十二萬及十一萬，早稻二十一萬及二十萬〇五千，各狂漲二成以上。</p>
<p>食油　價格狂漲，因銀根松，各物漲，而油價更以來貨斷，存底枯，貨主居奇，漲勢更厲。豆油收市一百三十六萬，生菜油一百十七萬，各漲二成半至三成。吉桶生油一百三十五萬，各貨均漲二成半至三成。豆餅有客幫去路，暴加四成。</p>
<p>麵粉　追蹤黃金，市勢激挺三成，開市後，以用用事業暴漲，圈外奔騰，且米價未開，場外喊價驚人，市場銀根又松，各方買氣濃厚，貨主板高甚力。開市各牌粉逐步上揚，老車一度高做八萬七，收市聞央行有拋，回做八萬五千五百元，兵船後市做八萬三千五百元，　皮叩七關，後市喊價續昂。</p>
<p>雜糧　全而奔騰，黃豆以油餅激升，猛晉四成，車豆升達廿二萬，冬豆後市高廿三萬元，生仁漲十餘萬，揚州提莊破五十大關，苞米紅糧普挺三成，芝麻交易不多。</p>
<h3>棉紗一致挺升　布疋高檔疾晉</h3>
<p>昨日紗市飛黃騰達，初開尚平，嗣以受黃金猛刺激，人心驚惶，執有者一致扳高，同業竭力搜羅，市價狂跳不已，結果各紗激挺二成至四成不等。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳由一一五〇萬元暴升至一四〇〇萬元結局，較前晉三五〇萬元，四〇支藍鳳衝破大關，創一三〇〇萬元新高，三二支銀月初開七五〇萬元，最後叩九〇〇萬元大關，軋漲二一〇萬元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨始做五八五萬元，最高達七六〇萬元，午收七四〇萬元，終挺二二五萬元。二〇支各檔均漲三成之譜，其他各紗無不創空前未有之新高價。午後因黃金回跌，人心轉虛，場外二一支雙馬七〇〇萬元有人售出</p>
<p>棉布續形堅秀，市上銀根松動，本街及客幫納胃轉旺，買氣又告展開，市勢頓見俏俐，臨收各布猛向高檔疾晉。</p>
<p>晨初龍頭細布做二十三萬八千元，甫升至二十五萬二千元，近午復退至二十五萬二千元，近午復退至二十二萬八千元，迄收因業外各物波動，人心振奮，同業猛吸，價乃創二十五萬元新高，較隔日後市漲一萬元。</p>
<p>四君子嗶嘰由二十二萬七千五百元挺至二十三萬八千元為最高，繼後曾低見二十二萬〇五百元，午收為二十三萬六千元，終漲五千元。一九〇高檔士林穿出大關，見五十四萬三千元新高峰，後市再見猛跳，三時許龍頭細布竟叩三十一萬，四君子嗶嘰二十九萬五千元。</p>
<h3>華股盤升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股市勢，前市初軟後堅，後市續告盤升。初聞場外黃金飛升，業內遊資外流，大戶不斷吐售，逢高力壓，市況屢見顧僕，旋因行局钜量差出，銀根走勢松濫，暗息暴退，枱面人心稍振，新買踵接，臨收突轉好而。永紗晨開二〇元〇五角，銀行幫逢低力進，市勢拉高，升至廿二元七角，場外對敲幫運續拋售，又低徊於二一元左右，一路疲樓盤旋，高峰無力站住。瀕午黃金升至頂峰，人心懼遭壓制，了金進股，金幫遊資移流，多頭翻轉軋空，枱面買氣驟旺，市勢飛升，高至二四元五角收盤。</p>

<p>後市因前市臨收購俏，人心仍佳。更因星五下午交易，可延至下週一交割，引起買風，開後永紗續見盤高。中間一度軟弱，臨收仍屹立二五八角收市。他股除美亞微軟外，均一致續升。全日成交四一億六千五百八十五萬股。</p>

<h3>市場散步</h3>
<p>— 看臺客</p>
<p>消息寒熱病　市面又瘋狂</p>
<p>昨起，市面又開始瘋狂，臨晚略後退，似有顧忌模樣。但潛勢頗緊；當與大局有關。</p>
<p>聽有關大局的消息，頭腦應該十分冷靜。松松緊緊還有的是，所以市場上跑跑的人，應該拿定主意。</p>
<p>現在，只要為了下面二個原因，已經不是做短線的時期。主意拿定，做垂線便能心安理得，並且可以賺錢不吃力了。</p>
<p>做長線應該注意的第一點：便是利息重。昨天多數橫跳二三成，一面是扯補週初風潮中的呆息；另一面是預料月中前當有一段趨緊時期。為了出貨調頭寸發工資的各業資方，哄哄高，才能脫貨放息一週也。這是近月來的慣例，我們已經指出過幾次。現在又是這個時候了。</p>
<p>做長線，應該注意的第二點：便是保產更比保幣值為重要。笨重的掉換輕巧的，輕巧的掉換精巧的，精巧的掉換靈便活瓏的，所以在全面瘋狂中，眼睛還是要看得清，認得准，盲目跟屁蟲，最後會穿著濕布衫的。</p>
<p>如果看短線，那末月中前調頭寸，以便發薪資，此事一樣比大局，值得留心。</p>
<p>過去幾個發資前的市面動態，為了愈近發薪期，銀根愈緊，利息愈高；而物價則反落後。所以一般資方，多數在發薪前一週間，先把貨物陸續力趁高拋售；調放拆息。如此做法，照理頭寸供源多，拆息會下遊，但事實為什麼卻又相反呢？因為多數人在出貨調頭寸，所以物價軟，因為物價軟，欲出又止的人們感覺需款之亟了。這樣的市場矛盾，便形成了發薪前一週內的特殊走勢了。</p>
<p>發薪前一週，出貨調頭寸，果然是資方應有的準備；對於一般職工階級，也有很大影響。因為發薪前物價平疲，那末開出的生活費指數壓低些，各方面的印象也就比較好些。換句話說，資方的負擔也就輕些。唯其如此，資方既有調頭寸必要而拋售，無形中又都有這種階級意識起著作用。三則，發薪前一週售貨，即有一週利息可收。利上滾利，加倍的希望雖非常有，但七八分的希望，不是沒有把握的。所以更何樂而不為了。</p>
<p>為了這些關系，看短線，就要看到這種骨子裏。那末，昨天的瘋狂，潛勢的堅強，在短線上的曲折，依然存在著。</p>
<p>譬如以股市為例，多頭公司雖然還未結束，所以　型紥足。但把利息加算加算，肉段並不很厚。發薪調頭寸，股市最方便，多頭不很厚。發薪調頭寸，股市最方便，多頭公司看短看長，決不會看掉自已的賬面。</p>
<p>順便提一提金鈔銀元罷，看大勢，金市可能發生央行措策上的薪變動。銀元這兩天的暴跳，和括血生意很有關係。美鈔的落後，為了實銷不如銀元，靈便不如銀元，這筆賬，一時還不致算得確定。可是便宜了央行。請大家注意注意外匯移轉證的變動罷</p>
<p>長線好過短線　發薪斬割週期</p>

<h3>海青表演出眾　滬警小勝兩球</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽甲一組已入尾聲，昨晚滬警對海青一場，賽前一般人預料，滬警頗能輕易應付，安知結果海青演出殊佳，出手亦極快，滬警在最後五分鐘時尚落後五分，海青未施凝結戰術，方幸以五十一比四十七獲勝。上半時廿四比廿一。海青昨晚由麥令斯第三聯隊出場，王伯文因考試未參戰。甲二D汕隊卅八比廿八勝晨友。</p>
<p>甲一組海青（麥令斯第三聯隊）對滬警，後者五人為王蓉生·何金貴·史久全·孫摩西·傅其俠五人，海青為華基·萊姆山·海克司·凱雄·萊若華·開場海青連獲三分，有一鳴驚人之勢，何金貴同樣還報，成各三平手。萊若華再中，蓉生久全得手，方以六比五超出，萊姆山一球復顛倒局面，從此滬警節節進攻，番將頻頻失利，且接連七次罰球未中，但右鋒華基跑快射准，與萊姆山左右呼應，又使滬警大擔心事，上半時滬警廿四比廿一微佔優勢。</p>
<p>滬警下半時摩西調久全，金貴調何增，接戰之下，海青出手極快，一會兒追成廿四·廿六·廿八，三次平手，久全再易摩西，歐納斯華基各一球，卅二比廿八滬警吃驚叫停。此後海青依然上風，惟相差常祇一分，形勢緊張之至，華基連中三元，又成四十四比卅九，當時還有五分鐘，海青以勝負無關大局，仍頻頻浪擲，逐予滬警可乘之機。旋由何增·久全·永標連罰帶擲，追成四五比四四，尚少一分。金貴復代久全，永標中籃，超出一分。華基二罰皆中又再領前。何增得罰球機會，屏息靜氣，扳成各四十七。何梁臨去秋波，把握機會，再添二球，滬警遂倖以五十一比四十七獲最後勝利。</p>

<p>（甲）前鋒向籃底兌款駢的時候。</p>
<p>（乙）守衛者離開獲分之區域沿著邊線傳球至中線之前鋒，為著要避免在中段場子傳球出去，故宜利用站在邊線之守衛將球傳出，較為穩當。</p>
<p>（丙）增加速度和身體的轉動，突然改變步伐轉身，由速步利用體重向前，縮著短步，藉膝部微灣而停止。</p>
<p>（丁）在奔跑時應能急卽改變為快或緩之步伐與方向，致於停止，發動，轉身，假動作或假動作轉身向別一個方向竄進等動作必須練習到純熟。（按：上項就是奔路的藝術，必須要勤練，才能達到身體靈活，左右逢源之境地。）</p>
<p>C　搶奪空中球。</p>
<p>（一）奪籃板彈回球。</p>
<p>（甲）當進攻者投籃，在球離手投向籃圈之後，守衛者應卽作搶奪籃板彈回球之準備。</p>
<p>（乙）對方在擲罰球時，位置在罰球區域邊線之球員在擲罰球者之球出手後應迅卽踏進重要區域籃圈之下搶奪籃板彈回之球，致進攻者之前鋒則須審慎從事，很容易因踏進重要區域內逾三秒鐘而犯規，這個搶奪籃板彈回球之責任可由擲罰球者來負責，他仍可站在罰球界附近來搶奪籃板彈回之球或接著同隊在籃下之球員之傳遞而再度投籃。</p>
<p>（丙）球員倘若是不精於搶奪籃扳彈回球則須注意採用下列三項方法：</p>
<p>（一）將指尖將球推到站在離籃較遠之同隊隊員。</p>
<p>（二）躍高用雙手將球推到邊線處來控持著。</p>
<p>（三）任前鋒的可以躍高用指尖將球推進籃圈之內。</p>
<p>（丁）球員須練習跳躍，須符合時間來搶奪籃扳彈回球，這是必須練習之課程，而許多女子隊對此點卻不加以注意。</p>
<p>按：球為馬搶奪到和控制著籃下球是可以增強攻勢和穩固守勢，人高腳長當然是可佔盡便宜，倘若是不精於位置之移動，人雖長亦無能為力，往往反受制於矮子，致奪取籃扳彈回之球，不宜進入籃底過深，否則彈回之球會從頭上掠過而搶不到手，若離籃太遠，則進攻者，可以搶先一著，再度投籃，最要著是看清楚皮球回彈之方向，位置約離籃七八尺左右。（未完·C）</p>

<h3>從茶館說起</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>在去年冬天，每壺淸茶漲到金圓券五元的時候，我為了手頭拮据，已經將十年來每天下午上茶館的習慣革除了。</p>
<p>在我們常熟，上茶館又簡直是上中下三階級生活上不可或免的一件事兒。上焉者商討要公，中焉者隨意聊天，或下棋終日，下焉者接洽買賣；以及跟人衝突之後，邀人評理（名日喫講茶），都在茶館裏面。</p>
<p>常熟茶館之多，僅次於蘇州。其中十分之一二兼開書塲。它的性質和格局却各各不同；像公園裏邊的「栗里」「環翠小築」（環翠這個名稱是續　海花作者燕谷老人起的，借用老殘姨太太的名字），面城臨水，高雅得很。在夏天，濃蔭如畫，淸茶一杯，也稱得人生一樂。「石梅」的四家茶館，（枕石軒，望山軒，挹辛廬，新梅嶺），都已有上百年的歷史。詩人楊旡恙先生在「石梅竹枝詞」上說得好：「枕石望山爭坐位，檀香橄欖雨前茶」。當年的盛况，還可從此參透一二。這兒是一般以收租為活的有閒階級的大本營。他們每天早晚兩茶，風雨無阻，從不誤卯，比上辦公廳還認眞。——不過去年田租粒米無收，淸茶三天一漲，兩天一加，現在是要金圓券三百元一壺了，因此茶客也在一天一天的减少。堂倌閒坐着嘆氣，時時在追念着過去的黃金時代。著名的「石梅燒餅」也一天一天的澆薄縮小，味道也變得淡了。從這兒，可以反映出有閒階級（或是小資產階級）是一天一天在沒落了。</p>
<p>南門外的「得意樓」和「長樂」，却依然茶客滿坑滿谷，那是沾了商人們以及「凖商人」們的光。他們為了打聽行情，或是買進賣出，「丟帽子」，「掮皮箱」，都非得上茶館不行，三百塊錢一壼淸茶，他們是毫不在乎，點心更是喫得滿桌。「商人畢竟是有辦法」，到處聽人家在講這句話。現實是無法反抗的，在亂世年頭，更談不上什麼風雅，「吃茶」的人畢竟是多於「品茶」的人，以後恐怕尺有「牛飲」的人了。</p>
<p>風雅的結局只是寒酸，「牛飲」的人才能領會到生活的眞諦。——我這篇小文　是有些迷戀過去，也未免有些寒酸相。但這也是無可奈何的事。</p>
<h3>火葬記</h3>
<p>— 以是</p>
<p>最近參加了一次朋友的火葬典禮，儀式簡單而隆重，誠是値得提倡的。</p>
<p>有上海，火葬似乎較內地普遍一些，—可是也說不上普遍，只是多些而已。我友生前極主火葬，故死後大殮畢，卽送靜安公墓。靜安公墓是本市唯一有火葬設備的地方。典禮開始，卽將屍身放在如小床大小的一個鐵架上，將鐵架推入爐中。爐以耐火磚砌成，闊約三四尺，高約五六尺，有頂，有烟囱。鐵架推入，恰像個烘麵包的麵包夾。鐵架推入後，將爐門關閉，然後以火點着充滿爐中的煤氣，立卽熊熊燃燒，先着衣服，再及體膚，其狀可在爐門的一個小孔中望見。其後管理者卽不許家屬親友逗留，以免見而不忍也。</p>
<p>此時，葬禮已完畢，親友也就散去。約二小時後，屍身已全化為骨灰，由殯儀館收集後，置於大理石的，金屬的，或本材製的灰盒中，其盒小巧美觀，卽交與家屬收領。</p>
<p>據管理者云：此設備在戰前僅供洋人及在滬居住達三年以上的華人基督徒用；及日寇據滬，乃供日人用。至抗戰勝利，由我衛生當局接收，且在極力提倡之下，現巳有應接不暇之勢。</p>
<p>參加了這次火葬典禮，深以為這也許是解決殯葬的最好辦法，簡單而不失隆重，達到省力，省錢，省時的地步。（一切手續均由殯儀館代辦，所費遠較棺葬少多。）且灰盒同樣可買穴而藏，或隨家携帶，同樣可祭祀紀念，我覺得確是値得提倡的。</p>
<h3>買希望</h3>
<p>— 閒君</p>
<p>馮緩替孟嘗君到薛地去收租，結果替他拿錢買了個「義氣」回來。現在則有買「希望」的，可稱古今媲美。什麼呌買希望呢？喏，就是現在當局發行，爭購一空的救濟獎券。化了五百元金圓券，就可有獨得三千萬金圓的希望，而且還能博得一個做善舉的美名，於是無怪人人趨之若驚了。</p>
<p>我有一個朋友，吿訴我一個趣聞。他說：有一位朋友，　得潦到不堪，袋裏只有幾張當票和一張人家送他的救濟獎券。他幾次三番想自殺，而結果終於因為有獨得三千萬元的希望，而沒有勇氣去自殺。</p>
<p>我說，假使就近年來當局種種措施上說，發行救濟獎券，到也可以算是德政之一呢，——因為救了人家性命，沒有使他立刻自殺。</p>
<h3>智慧之屑</h3>

<p>上本著名心理學家黑田亮，曾研究過男女作夢的次數。據他說：男子十天內平均作夢二。七次，女子三·五次。</p>
<h3>美國的連環圖畫</h3>
<p>— 娑宇</p>
<p>在我國的大城市裏，連環圖畫已成為一種普遍的「兒童讀物」；但在一般窮鄕僻壤，則還不大容易見到。但在美國，情形就不同了。美國的連環岡畫眞是個出版界的奇蹟，每月平均竟有六千萬册的銷路。</p>
<p>美國的連環圖晝，內容當然也和我國的不同。他們把火箭·死光砲代替了劍光法寳，把蠻人野獸代替了妖魔精怪。其內容，大都充滿了謀殺和瘋在的虛待，這些對於兒童當然是有害無益的</p>
<p>美國敎育界，對於這種連環圖畫是一致反對的。他們搜集了許多因連環圖畫而引起的犯罪案件。一個十七歲的少年蓄意刺傷了一個十三歲的同伴，他說：「我並不看很多連環圖晝，——一星期大約只看十本。我歡喜看關於犯罪的連環晝，在裏面，他們時常把女孩子用刀刺死。」另一個十七歲的靑年殺了人，還留下一張字條，上面署着「魔鬼」兩字。三個十六歲的少年，共同殺了一個十四歲的男孩子，「為了報仇」。一個十四歲的少年用槍打死了一個警察。一個十三歲的男孩拿了手槍到店舖裏去搶錢。另一個十二歲的孩子殺死了他的妹妹；還有個十三歲的男孩謀殺了他的同伴，因此被判二十二年的徒刑。上面這些驚人罪案的主角，據他們自已說，都是喜歡看連環圖畫的。</p>
<p>在學校裏，連環圖晝引起了驚人的暴行。一個十六歲的孩子被同學用碎玻璃瓶打得遍體鱗傷，就祗兩眼附近的傷處，也有六處需要用針縫起來。在一所小學裏，年紀大的學生時常虐待並恐嚇年紀小的，把他們的錢，錶和目來水筆搶去。當敎師問他們是誰搶了他們的東西時，他們不肯說，為了「不願自己的眼睛被挖出來」。在一所平民學校裏，經常有兩個警察巡邏着，阻止各種暴行。某校的數學敎員每當考試，必須請一個警察來帮他「監考。」</p>
<p>在美國，祇有百分之二十五的家長對連環圖晝不表反對，其餘百分之七十五都竭力主張取締。他們都認為連環圖畫不但使兒童失去了看良好讀物的機會，並且也使兒童的頭腦中了慢性的毒。兒童們自己也注意到了這一點。在芝加哥一所小學裏，學生們日動把他們所有的連環岡畫書一起燒了，並且還一同到附近的書店文具店去，對那裏的老闆說：他們以後決不再買連環圖畫了。最近又有好幾所學校，也在發起這個「拒看」的運動。</p>
<h3>週末消遣</h3>
<p>— 余忘我</p>
<h3>飯店中</h3>
<p>— 若虛</p>
<p>這是一件我所親見的眞的事實。</p>
<p>我在一家小公司中服務。因為辦公處離家太遠，所以總在附近的一家飯店中吃中飯。那家飯店，說大不大，說小不小，却是優劣飯菜，一應俱全；因此三敎九流的人物，都有光臨；雖不能說車水馬龍，却還算得上營業鼎盛。就在這些三敎九流的人物中，有一個引起了我很大的注意。這位先生，長衫一襲，呢帽一頂，公事皮包，胸前還扣着一隻圓形徽章，走起路來四平八穩地頗帶些文氣，無疑的那是個不知什麼機關裏的一位小公務員。</p>
<p>大約不到半年前吧，我第一次見他踏進這家飯店，凑巧就坐在我的對面。他開了一客飯，另外添些小菜，沽些酒，邊酌邊食，悠閒地望望門外，眞是自得其樂。當然我是個窮小子，只能吃些鹽豆瓣，醬油蘿匐之類的東西，看見了這樣的一位豪客，不由得不肅然起敬，一方面又有些魏涎欲滴。怎奈囊中缺乏子兒，只得嚥口唾沫，貪　地望望他的豐盛的菜肴，狠狠地猛嚼醫油蘿蔔，大口地吞下飯去，甚至把舌頭都嚼痛了。於是我把一切都歸罪於那位豪客，我匆匆呑完飯憤憤然白了他一眼，然後帶着不平的樣子付帳出去。</p>
<p>可怪他好像有意要吃癟我似的，時常是不先不後的和我一塊兒到，坐在左近。於是上面的那一套，便變成了我的例行功課：每天我白他一眼，付了帳，帶着負傷的舌頭出去。……</p>
<p>就在一個月以前，我心目中的那位豪客，漸漸變了，他顯得不豪了，他的菜由豐盛的變成較劣的；再由較劣的，變成簡不直了添菜。接着他的客飯也由高等降到中等，而經濟客飯。他的臉不再悠閒地朝門外看了。每天，他匆匆地進來，伏在桌上，扒完那幾口紅米飯，再匆匆地出去。偶然抬起頭望望我，眼光裏好似帶些窘態，就急忙低頭吃飯。雖然，在這時，他所吃的依舊要比我好一些，我吃的根本還不能躋於客飯的寳座。</p>
<p>但是一星期以前，他終於也由這寳座上跌下來了。他開始不吃客飯，而改吃六個饅頭，再漸漸地由六個變成四個。他根本不再望我，每天只匆匆地進來，匆匆地出去……</p>
<p>有一天，大概是那好心的堂倌，對他那種每况愈下的樣子，也有些覺察，或竟有些可憐他吧，對他善意的說道：</p>
<p>「老客，我看你還是改用淸飯吧。四個饅頭倒要一千多，還沒有淸飯飽，飯只要八百，還奉送一碟子菜。」</p>
<p>我放下了筷，抬頭望望那豪客，——他現在不豪了，他的嘴脣抖抖地想說些什麼話，他的臉紅了，一股難堪的神氣。但是接着他不說什麼，一陣苦笑，掠過他的面龐。他　下了頭，輕輕地說一聲：「謝謝你，就替我弄一客淸飯吧。」於是他的飯開上來了；二碗紅米飯，一碟子醬油蘿葡跟我的一模一樣，是最劣的一種。我望望放在各人面前的三片醬汕蘿匐，下意識地笑了。</p>
<p>就在這天以後，我照例去吃中飯。但是這一次，我覺得顯著的異樣，對面的豪客不見了。他不再來了。是堂倌傷害了他的自尊心呢？還是他連淸飯的資格都沒有了呢？</p>
<p>角落裏，一架破舊的留聲機在放一張古老而褪色的歌曲唱片：「何日君再來」。我不禁替那位每况愈下的小公務員叫起寃來，雖然他曾屢次的使我嚼痛舌頭。我於是更憤憤然地猛嚼起醬油蘿蔔來。</p>

<h3>Presidential Residence Late-Night Meeting: Peace Talks Approaching Critical Stage; Government Refuses to Transfer Military Power Within a Deadline</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Peace talks are approaching a critical stage. The next few days will determine whether peace can be achieved or whether the two sides will continue to engage in military conflict. Although optimists have found a basis for their optimism in some difficult facts, the obstacles encountered in the peace talks are undeniably significant. A certain authoritative person pointed out to reporters on the evening of the 8th: (1) The Communist army is demanding to cross the Yangtze River during the peace talks; (2) Acting President Li sent a telegram to Mao Zedong, reiterating his determination to seek peace; (3) He Yingqin hurriedly returned to Nanjing from Guangzhou; (4) Bai Chongxi was summoned to Beijing from Wuhan; (5) The activities in Beijing of the three representatives from Beiping should all be given attention. It is said that government representatives found considerable differences between the two sides in their initial talks with the CCP representatives in Beiping. Another point of contention is the issue of punishing war criminals, the first of the eight conditions. The CCP insists on adhering to the eight conditions in principle, only willing to relax the scale. The government believes that it should consider the people and only focus on future issues, without overly pursuing past responsibilities. At this critical stage of the peace talks, Acting President Li telegraphed Mao Zedong directly, frankly stating the difficulties and focal points of the peace talks, and was willing to bear the responsibility himself, with the aim of first seeking agreement and understanding on this issue so that the peace talks could proceed smoothly. As for the issues of crossing the river, reorganizing the army, and the future government, Acting President Li stated in his telegram that he would follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will to cooperate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and jointly assume responsibility with all democratic figures to build the nation. The intention is that if the peace talks are successful, people from all sides will form a coalition government, and the military issue can be easily resolved. The main purpose of He Yingqin's flight to Guangzhou was to listen to the opinions of party members on the peace talks. After staying in Guangzhou for two days, he hurriedly returned to Beijing. Bai Chongxi also came to Beijing from Wuhan on the same day at the summons of Acting President Li, indicating that there would be a major decision in Beijing on the evening of the 8th. This decision is also closely related to the fact that the three representatives from Beiping must return to Beiping on the 9th or 10th. The person predicted that the entire situation of the peace talks would have a decisive development within two or three days.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] It is reported that the formal meeting of the peace talks in Beiping had not yet started on the 8th. On the evening of the 8th, the government delegation, including He Yingqin, Yan Xishan, Bai Chongxi, Wu Zhongxin, and Tong Guanxian, gathered to discuss the peace talks, and dispersed at about 1 a.m. on the 9th.</p>
<p>Acting President's Telegram to Mao Zedong</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Acting President Li telegraphed Mao Zedong at 11 p.m. on the 7th. The original text is as follows: "Director Zhang Wenbai to Mr. Runzhi: Since Zongren took office, he has overcome all difficulties and is determined to seek peace. His sincere intentions are well known to all of your party's democratic figures. Now that the peace talks have begun, the government representatives have come to Beiping as invited, and the issues for discussion have adopted the eight articles proposed by Guanfang as the basis. Zongren is mindful of the cruelty of war, the suffering of the people, and the mistakes made in the history of mankind. Therefore, considering the focal points of the difficulties in the peace talks, I am willing to act with a compassionate heart and make further statements. All so-called historical mistakes that hinder peace, such as the so-called war criminals, even if [they] have committed egregious crimes, I am willing to be responsible for them all. My sincere intention is to invite all of your party's democratic figures to jointly shoulder the mission of building a new China. Moreover, as the international situation becomes increasingly complex, cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is even more urgent. If we both uphold this principle, other issues can be easily resolved. What does Zongren seek? What I hope for today is to turn swords into plowshares and to let the people live in peace. My sincere heart is as clear as white water. I am sending this telegram to express my sincerity, hoping for your understanding. Brother Li Zongren, 7th day of the 4th month (April) [seal]."</p>
<h3>Interview with Mysterious Guest from the South: Lengthy Conversation with Our Reporter for One and a Half Hours</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The importance of the three individuals who arrived in Beijing on the 5th, accompanied by Liu Zhongrong, to the issue of peace talks has been confirmed by the developments of the past three days. The actions of these three individuals in Beijing are extremely mysterious, and government officials are very secretive about it. What can currently be revealed is that these three individuals represent three different positions. One of them is Mr. Li Minxin, representing Li Jishen. Another is said to have a very high status and his own personal position, engaging in the peace movement in a personal capacity, with no relationship to Li Minxin and the other individual. These three individuals are seen as mysterious figures in the political atmosphere in Beijing. However, apart from attending the dinner hosted by the Acting President on the evening of the 7th, they have not had any meetings. However, the achievements obtained by the reporter after three days of persistent pursuit have made it clear about their political environment. Therefore, their mystery, apart from the reporter being unable to announce their names on their behalf, has become an important political characteristic. Late on the 8th, the reporter requested to interview one of the three individuals who did not wish to announce his name in a house that was not a government residence. A conversation lasting one and a half hours allowed the reporter to learn about the efforts and achievements of the three individuals in the peace talks. This person has a very high status and was a teacher and friend of Lin Sen, Li Jishen, and Gu Zhutong. He has a consistent advocacy for peace. After the "local peace" in Beiping, he went to Beiping. This time, his coming south is "representing his personal [views]" to seek peace for the people. This person repeatedly stated that he has no connection with the other individuals who came with him. It is said that he did not exchange a word with the other individuals on the special plane. After getting off the plane, he took a car that came to pick him up and left the airport. The other two individuals got out of the car by themselves and ate noodles and got a haircut in a small shop in Fuzimiao, without being noticed. This person was wearing a blue cloth robe, of medium height, around fifty years old, with bright eyes, walking with a cane, and in excellent spirits. When he discovered the reporter at his residence late on the 8th, he showed a surprised expression. He avoided answering the actual questions asked by the reporter. Summarizing the hour and a half of conversation, what can be told to the readers is that this person's opinions on coming to Beijing to work for peace include the significance of the Acting President's telegram to Mao Zedong. This is the achievement of the past three days, but it is not their goal. They will continue to work to achieve the goal of peace. This person also said that if the goal is not achieved, they will not return to Beiping before the 11th. When asked whether this goal can be achieved, this person said that it will depend on everyone's efforts. In this person's conversation, it was shown that the difficulties of the peace talks are very great, but at the same time, it shows that peace is not hopeless. After arriving in Beijing on the 5th, he attended a long conversation with Acting President Li for two hours on the evening of the 6th. On the 7th, he attended a banquet hosted by Acting President Li again, sitting with the other two individuals. In addition, he has also met with important officials in Beijing very frequently. Gu Zhutong hosted a banquet to entertain them on the afternoon of the 8th.</p>
<h3>Observer Believes Communist Army Crossing the Yangtze Within Ten Days is Impossible</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] In the past two or three days, due to widespread rumors in Beijing that the Communist Party has issued an ultimatum to the government, the general public believes that the Communist army may cross the Yangtze River and advance southward within ten days, which has obviously caused a tense reaction in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other government-controlled areas. Moreover, Premier He Yingqin, who was originally scheduled to return to Beijing on Saturday, has specially returned to Beijing from Guangzhou today, which seems to further illustrate that the government must make a major decision on the demands made by the Communist side within a short period of time. As a matter of fact, since the Communist army launched the Anqing offensive on March 24, the Communist army's actions to capture the bridgeheads north of the Yangtze River, from Yizheng in the east to Hankou in the west, have already begun. Except for the Communist army's Anqing offensive being frustrated by the government forces and suffering a setback, in the area north of the Yangtze River east of Anqing, after two weeks of rehearsals, the Communist army has already swallowed four military strategic points: Zongyang, Liujiadu, Tuqiao, and Yizheng. At present, except for Huayangzhen west of Anqing, only one bridgehead has been swallowed by the Communist army. The remaining strongholds are still intact. Those east of Anqing include Erba and Yuxizhen on the opposite side of Wuhu, Xiliangshan on the opposite side of Dangtu, Liangpu area on the opposite side of Nanjing, Guazhou on the north bank of Zhenjiang, and Kou'anzhen on the north bank of Yangzhou, Liuxigang on the north bank of Jiangyin, a total of seven bridgeheads, which are still in the hands of the National Army. According to military observations, even if the rumored Communist ultimatum has been delivered to the government, and the Communist army's actual actions, if they only want to take down the above-mentioned seven bridgeheads before crossing the river in full force, it will still take two weeks, as in the past, to capture them. This only refers to the situation east of Anqing. Furthermore, regarding the Communist army from the opposite side of Jiujiang, Xiaochikou in the west, to Hankou, although they once advanced to Huangpi Station, less than ninety li from Hankou, they were immediately pushed back to the area 30 miles outside Hankou. Therefore, from the perspective of the military situation, unless there is a sudden change within the National Army, which would make it easy for the Communist army to cross the river, there is no reason to predict that the Communist army crossing the river within ten days can become a reality. Although the CCP radio station has repeatedly emphasized in recent days that the Communist army will attack south of the Yangtze River, its actual effect is more political than military. Today, Cai Mingyong, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, personally flew to the air above Heshangzhou in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River east of Zhenjiang in the afternoon to conduct an aerial inspection of the situation, clarifying that the rumors that the Communist army was using wooden rafts and small boats to cross the river in large numbers from there were completely inaccurate. Furthermore, according to the information obtained by the military, it has long been provided that the Communist army has gathered ships and troops on the north bank of the Yangtze River, which is a fact. Among them, the number of wooden boats gathered south of the Ji Lake on the north bank of the Wan River is about 10,000, with about 100,000 troops. This situation is indeed particularly alarming. According to expert judgment, this military situation, as well as sporadic small rebellions on the side of the National Army, such as the Banqiao Jia Yu incident, cannot but cause some psychological fluctuations on the National Army side of the peace talks. However, if both sides of the peace talks are determined to continue talking, this superficial situation is just an interlude of the sword dance at the Hongmen banquet.</p>
<h3>Mao Zedong Agrees to Stop Attacking Government Propaganda Offensive During Peace Talks; Has Notified Political Workers Not to Broadcast Provocative Words</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] According to sources close to Acting President Li on the 8th, Mao Zedong, at the request of the government peace talk delegation, has agreed to stop the "propaganda offensive" during the peace talks, and has ordered political workers to avoid attacking the government and government personnel in their broadcasts. This promise by Mao has been telegraphed to Acting President Li by Zhang Zhizhong on the evening of the 7th. As early as when the government representatives arrived in Beiping and contacted the Communist side, the government representatives mentioned this matter. Mao stated at the time that the sharp words criticizing the government were made by political workers and had nothing to do with the CCP authorities' talks on peace. However, in order to avoid excessive stimulation, Mao made this decision. The person also said that whether the CCP's promise has been fulfilled, we can obtain factual proof from later Xinhua News Agency broadcasts.</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu Tense, Yizheng Falls; Artillery Fire Across the River Clearly Heard in Zhenjiang; National Army in Jiangpu Recaptures Gaolidian, Communist Army's Offensive Thwarted</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] Yizheng, an isolated city in northern Jiangsu, finally abandoned its defense at about 8 p.m. on the 7th under heavy artillery fire from the Communist army. The Communist army's artillery positions were set up at Xupu Bridge north of the city, with five heavy artillery pieces. They began firing more than 100 shells into the city and the Jiangmian River in Siyuangou at 8 p.m. At about 5 p.m., the county government caught fire after being hit by a shell, and several places at the large pier outside the south gate also caught fire. At this time, more than 1,000 Communist troops immediately attacked the west gate. The defending troops outside the north gate heard the news and reached the city to reinforce, but it was too late to stop them. A fierce street battle then broke out. County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren led the security forces out of the encirclement and retreated to the south gate (four li from Siyuangou). Unexpectedly, a part of the Communist army attacked from the west gate and then divided its forces to garrison the positions of the defending troops on the Shamanzhou southeast of the city, controlling the Jiangmian River in Siyuangou. County Magistrate Zuo then broke out of the south gate and searched for the Communist army along the Siyuangou Highway. While travelling to the Yisi Bridge, he encountered the Communist army midway and a battle broke out. County Magistrate Zuo's whereabouts are unknown after the fierce battle.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] After the Communist army captured Yizheng, they launched an offensive against the Sancha River, Shijiaqiao, and Twelve Fort areas at dawn on the 8th. The rumbling of artillery fire could be clearly heard here all day long, and the glass windows in the room were shaking. The battle line on the Yangzhou-Liuhe line has now moved south to the vicinity of Zhujia Qigan and Lao Sifu, five miles south of Shijiaqiao. The National Army's positions are intact. The National Army on the south bank is now crossing the Yangtze River at night to reinforce Liuxu, Guazhou, and Twelve Fort.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] The Yisiyuezhou in Yizheng is located between Twelve Fort and Gaozi, surrounded by water on all sides, forming an isolated island. At present, Fan Xiyuan, the head of the Second Regiment of the County Security Force, is leading his troops to stand by, but there is a shortage of food and ammunition.

<h3>Central Standing Committee Reviewed Government's Diplomatic Policy; Consistent Policy Should Absolutely Not Have Any Changes; Government Will Form Peace Guidance Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 7th] (Delayed) After the Central Political Committee meeting on the 7th, a one-person-at-a-time Central Standing Committee meeting was held immediately. First, Premier He Yingqin reported on military affairs, including the Communist army's attack on the southern section of the Pinghan Road and the situation in Anqing and Yizheng. He also reported on the situation of the government representatives after arriving in Beiping for several days and the financial situation. Then, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao reported on the international situation. In general, the Communist army's offensive was given importance. There was a heated discussion at the meeting, which generally believed that after the peace talks, both sides should immediately cease fire to avoid the people suffering from war again. It was generally hoped that the Communist Party could accept the government's ceasefire proposal to show sincerity in the peace talks. At the same time, the government's diplomatic policy was also carefully reviewed, and it was generally believed that since the War of Resistance Against Japan, cooperation with all democratic countries in the international community, participation in the United Nations organization, and joint efforts for world peace have been very appropriate. This consistent diplomatic policy should absolutely not have any changes. Therefore, although the Central Political Committee gave post-recognition to the foreign minister of Chuan Bingchang, it was by no means the government changing its diplomatic policy. After the meeting, there was much discussion about the recent CCP broadcasts advocating uniting the people of the country and preparing to participate in the Soviet Union's group operations, which was considered a complete violation of the people's desire for peace. Finally, the members exchanged opinions on the peace talks issue until the meeting adjourned at 6 p.m. The detailed content could not be learned, but it was heard that the key to the success of the peace talks would be whether the Communist army was willing to cease fire and whether it still wanted to cross the Yangtze River. It was also heard that the government would form a peace guidance committee based on this principle, so that the peace representatives could consult at any time for instructions.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Revisions to the Financial and Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>The revised version of the financial and economic reform plan has been sent to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. After reading the revised reform plan, we have generally gained an outline of the financial and economic policies of the new Minister of Finance, Liu Gongyun.</p>
<p>The content of the financial and economic policies still follows the old path of Xu Keting's new financial and economic reform plan, but there are also significant differences, namely in the following points: (1) The national treasury will no longer subsidize transportation and public utilities; (2) Establish a "tax unit" system, with each tax unit equivalent to one fen of gold in the market system, to be purchased with gold yuan notes; (3) Prepare for property tax; (4) Appropriately handle production loans; (5) Implement cost-of-living index deposits or other value-guaranteed deposits. Now we will examine each of these points separately.</p>
<p>The government subsidy policy was implemented most widely and effectively in wartime Britain. At that time, Britain lacked resources and had to make every effort to increase production and compete for imported materials. The extra costs paid for competing for production and purchase should not be included in the Jia price, making it unaffordable for those with low incomes. Therefore, a subsidy system was implemented. As for our country, the current situation of subsidizing transportation and public utilities cannot be compared with that of Britain. According to the scope of subsidies in our country, there are postal and telecommunications, railways, airplanes, ships, highway passenger cars, buses, telephones, trams, electricity, gas, ferries, tap water, etc. Although some of the classes enjoying these services are truly people with low incomes and heavy burdens (especially public school teachers), airplanes, gas, telegrams, telephones, and first and second class tickets for railways and ships are mostly enjoyed by people in the middle class and above. If we still want to use the blood and sweat of ordinary people living in poverty to subsidize their enjoyment, of course we will feel guilty! Therefore, we strongly agree with abolishing the subsidy system and achieving self-sufficiency for each unit. However, when the departments in charge of transportation and public utilities are setting fee standards, it is best to increase the burden on first-class enjoyment and subsidize ordinary people with low-level enjoyment, so that the majority of people can have the opportunity to enjoy transportation and public utilities.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about the "tax unit" issue. This is a new system that stipulates that each unit is equivalent to one fen of gold and is used exclusively for paying taxes. This has the same effect as using "customs yuan" to pay import taxes, but it has a greater impact on the lives of the people. Because imported goods are not enjoyed by ordinary people, the impact on people's lives from calculating and paying with "customs yuan" is still small. However, if all taxes are paid entirely with "tax units," then it may not be affordable for people below the middle class! Although the business community still has room to pass on the cost, how can the salary class and ordinary people who receive gold yuan notes every month endure it? Of course, national taxes should be "accurate," but if they do not consider the ability of the people to bear them, then there is no difference from "killing the chicken to get the eggs." The result will still be to create more poverty and social unrest, which is definitely not an appropriate solution. Moreover, the property tax is still in the "preparation" stage. We strongly hope that the authorities can quickly show their courage and adhere to the fair principle of "those with money should contribute money," and not let the many wealthy people "evade" their tax obligations, leaving the burden entirely on the ordinary people.</p>
<p>Again, regarding the implementation of cost-of-living index deposits or other value-guaranteed deposits, we believe that the former is definitely not a good opportunity at present. People still vividly remember the stimulus of forcibly deducting 40% of their gold savings in the past, and fair and reasonable solutions for the repayment methods of pre-war deposits and public bonds have not yet been obtained. If these many prerequisites cannot be eliminated, I am afraid that people will definitely not easily take the bait. Furthermore, the words "cost of living index" may not have a good impression on the people. The cost of living index currently compiled specifically for public school teachers is entirely under the control of the government, which is already well known. And isn't the cost of living index for workers in various places also subject to technical calculation problems, often leading to labor unrest? Therefore, in this environment, it is absolutely not easy to get the support of the people when it comes to handling cost-of-living index deposits. As for the latter, which is the widely rumored silver dollar deposit, although we dare not place too much extravagant hope on silver dollar deposits, it is clearly much more concrete than the former, because (1) the impression of silver dollars among the people is extremely profound and widespread, and transactions in various places already use silver dollars as a bargaining chip; (2) the silver dollar unit is similar to the purchasing power of each yuan before the war, and receipts and payments are extremely flexible; (3) silver dollars have a public market and price, which is definitely not as abstract as the price index; (4) banks in Lanzhou, Kunming, and Changsha have widely implemented silver dollar deposit and loan businesses, and the government expenses of Fuzhou and Hunan provinces and cities also use silver dollars as the unit. If the government can adapt to the abuse of liquidity at present and change with the times, then handling silver dollar deposits will obviously help the current economic policy. However, what is worrying is that most bankers are showing a timid attitude for the sake of their own interests.</p>
<p>Finally, we contributed eight principles to the opinion on the appropriate handling of production loans in the editorial of this newspaper on the 31st of last month, hoping that the authorities can carefully consider them. We do not hope that this production loan is only to perfunctorily meet the requirements of a few industrial capitalists, nor do we hope for a "mere formality" loan clause. We hope that after handling the loan, it can truly help legitimate production businesses, so that it can achieve the effect of increasing materials and stabilizing prices, and fully achieve the spirit of the loan.</p>
<p>In summary, we believe that the current financial and economic policies should have a concrete plan, and it is absolutely impossible to treat the head when it hurts and the feet when they hurt. The policy must especially focus on the practical spirit, so as to obtain the greatest effectiveness. In today's situation where the government's financial and economic policies have lost the hearts of the people and lost credibility, the authorities should promptly handle silver dollar deposits as a basis for restoring credibility and winning back the hearts of the people, thereby laying a new foundation for finance.</p>
<h3>Report on Simplifying Provincial Administrative Institutions; Legislative Yuan Decides to Remand for Review; Fierce Debate Arises on Reforms to the Banking System and Other Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th] The twelfth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 am on the 8th, presided over by Tong Guanxian. Reporting items: The Executive Yuan consulted on the draft of the Organizational Law of the Executive Yuan's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, which was decided to be jointly reviewed by the Legislative Committee and the Financial and Economic Committee. The Executive Yuan consulted on the draft revision of the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Interior, which was decided to be jointly reviewed by the Interior and Local Autonomy Committee and the Legislative Committee, and each of the Labor, Land Administration, Social Affairs, and Health Committees was requested to recommend one member to participate. The Executive Yuan consulted on the proposed draft revision of the Financial and Economic Reform Plan. A request for investigation and review was made, and it was decided to be reviewed by the Financial and Economic Committee. Matters for discussion: First, the review report on simplifying provincial administrative institutions was discussed. Various legislators spoke one after another, and opinions differed. Finally, it was decided to remand the matter to the Interior and Local Autonomy Committee and the Legislative Committee for review, and to submit it to the Yuan meeting for discussion within one week. Wang Dingsheng and others proposed that the Postal Law and the Law on the Management of State-Owned Enterprises were contradictory, and proposed revising the Postal Law. It was resolved to follow the opinion of the Procedural Committee and jointly review it by the Transportation Committee and the Legislative Committee. Then, the proposal by Wang Lihang was discussed, stating that the current national administrative bureaus and treasury agencies are large, their operations are redundant, their expenses are huge, their organizations are extremely unreasonable, and they have the most significant impact on the national economy, people's livelihood, finance, and prices. A method for reforming national financial institutions, thoroughly reorganizing the administrative bureaus and treasury agencies, establishing a legal banking system, eradicating the control of powerful families and compradors, saving the crisis of economic collapse, and rescuing the starving and freezing people was specially proposed. The original text of the proposal was very long, and the reading time was too long. It was already close to noon, and it was decided to continue the discussion in the afternoon. The meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 3:30 pm, and the proposal by Wang Lihang to reorganize national administrative treasury agencies and the proposal by Wu Shipeng and others to reform the banking system in order to promote the development of the national economy and people's livelihood were discussed together. After a long debate, it was decided to submit the cases separately to the Financial and Economic Committee and the Legislative Committee for joint review. The proposal by Shu Yunchang and others to strongly request the abolition of the Import and Export Management Committee in order to simplify the administration and save public funds was presented. When the legislators spoke, they almost all agreed to abolish it. It was decided to submit it to the Economic Resources Committee, the Financial and Economic Committee, and the Legislative Committee for joint review. The meeting adjourned at 6 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Intense Debate on Financial Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th] Wang Lihang's proposal to reform national financial institutions and thoroughly reorganize national administrative treasury agencies and Wu Shipeng's proposal to reform the banking system were submitted for discussion at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 8th, causing a fierce debate. The original proposers and most legislators expressed dissatisfaction with the malpractices and financial manipulations of national administrative treasury agencies over the years, and all advocated that they should be thoroughly reformed. Zhong Zhaoxiang, based on facts and theories, believed that the various national administrative bureaus had their value of existence, and put forward the opposite opinion, causing a fierce debate in the meeting. During the discussion, the proposers Wang Lihang and Wu Shipeng first explained the reasons and opinions for the proposal, arguing that it should be discussed and completed within a limited time and should not be delayed any further. After Wang and Wu finished their explanations, Liang Dong first spoke, saying that the crimes of the national administrative bureaus were well known: (1) the expenditures of the national administrative bureaus were not subject to the national budget; (2) the personnel of the national administrative bureaus were not subject to the personnel selection of the Ministry of Personnel; (3) the accounts of the national administrative bureaus were not submitted to the Audit Department; (4) the institutions of the national administrative bureaus did not belong to the Ministry of Finance, and their actions were mostly to hoard and speculate, manipulate finance, and everything was controlled by imperial relatives and wealthy households. If they were not thoroughly reformed, then the country, the government, and the people would have no hope. Zhong Zhaoxiang believed that the dissatisfaction with financial institutions was universally felt, but there were four factors that could affect finance: (1) financial policy; (2) financial system; (3) personnel and management; (4) external factors. When we examine financial institutions, we should proceed according to the four factors, and should not generalize the rest with only one factor. Legislator Wang blamed the corruption of financial institutions all on the system, which actually overlooked other factors. The current trend of world finance is toward specialization. The Soviet Union also implements a specialized banking system. Therefore, Legislator Wang's proposal for diversification is actually inconsistent with today's trend. He argued that the above-mentioned basic views should be based on when reviewing this case, and the claim in the Wang proposal to abolish commercial banks is tantamount to denying the existence of industry and commerce, and hoarding and other phenomena are also mostly due to external factors and should not be abandoned because of choking. As soon as Zhong Zhaoxiang finished speaking, Wang Lihang stood up again and shouted, "We must show the identity of the legislators and not speak for the capitalists," and believed that the four points mentioned by Legislator Zhong were actually only one point, namely the financial system problem, and asked, "What kind of system are our national administrative bureaus?" Miao Qiping spoke after Wang, and he excitedly shouted: "Our blood has been sucked dry by the national administrative bureaus. If we don't thoroughly reform, everything will be hopeless." Liu Quanzhong expressed his support for Wang's proposal, but argued that there should be some amendments. At this point, President Tong immediately stood up and proposed to submit the case for review. Before he finished speaking, Wang Lihang angrily pointed at President Tong and said: "Chairman, I want to give you a serious warning. Every time we discuss this case, you say submit it for review. Could it be that you have dealings with the banking sector?" Afterwards, Zhang Jingma proposed that the two cases be submitted for review separately, which was passed without objection.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Procedure Committee Decides on the Next Meeting Agenda</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th] The Legislative Yuan Procedure Committee met at 6 pm on the 8th and decided on the agenda for the next general meeting.

<h3>Plan for North-South Navigation and Exchange of Goods; Executive Yuan Holds Review Meeting; Representatives from Shanghai Shipping and Business Circles Invited to Attend; The Entire Case Will Be Submitted to the Weekly Government Affairs Meeting for Discussion</h3>

Eleven representatives from the Shanghai shipping and business circles were also invited to attend, reporting on their views on navigation and exchange of goods. Wei Wenhun first spoke, reporting on the technical problems of navigation and requesting the passage of the North-South navigation plan. At the same time, he requested the restoration of passenger transport, hoping that the government would help the shipping industry restore the opening of the Beiyang Line, so as to prevent the Hong Kong shipping industry from seizing the navigation benefits of Beiyang. Wei also estimated that the Beiyang Line would need about 50,000 tons of ships, requiring thirty ships of 1,000 to 3,000 tons. He hoped that the government would approve the commencement of navigation immediately, and allow representatives from business circles to quickly go north. Representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and industry also emphasized that if North-South navigation could not be opened soon, Shanghai's industry and commerce would be affected. Then, the various shipping representatives left, and Deputy Premier Jia continued to preside over the meeting and conduct the review. The meeting adjourned at around 6 pm. The entire plan has been reviewed, and the management methods for navigation have also been decided to be simplified as much as possible so as not to disturb the people, and it is scheduled to be submitted for discussion at the government affairs meeting next week.</p>

<h3>Gradual Merger of the Three Occupation Zones in West Germany; the US, UK, and France Sign an Agreement; the West German Government to be Established Within Sixty Days; Approved to Participate in the Marshall Plan Assistance Zone</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] After several discussions on the West German issue, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, Bevin, Acheson, and Schuman, signed the formal agreement of the three countries on West Germany today. The content has been announced simultaneously today in London, Washington, Paris, and Berlin. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The full planning of the administration of the merger zone of the United Kingdom and the United States and the French zone in West Germany, as well as the gradual removal of the boundaries between the three occupation zones in West Germany. (2) The establishment of a West German country within the next two months. (3) The trend towards consistency in military responsibilities among the three occupying forces in West Germany. (4) The continuation of the British and American airlift system to supply Berlin, and the use of air stations in the French zone if necessary. (5) The overall planning of trade among the three zones of West Germany and with foreign countries. (6) Recognizing West Germany as a member of the Atlantic Pact.</p>
<p>This agreement is a major step towards the realization of West Germany. The important significance of this agreement to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg has been jointly notified by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The State Department spokesman specifically pointed out the characteristic of the rapid establishment of the agreement, and believed that under normal circumstances, the negotiation of the agreement must take a considerable amount of time, and it is likely to be signed in late May. The reason why it was able to be established quickly is due to the establishment of the Atlantic Pact and the rapid deterioration of the international situation. British officials also acknowledged that the rapid establishment of the agreement shows the important role of the Atlantic Pact in international relations. In the future, the development of Europe will regard the Atlantic Pact as its key, and the agreement reached by the three zones on West Germany will undoubtedly be a pioneer in building other agreements among Western countries.</p>

(2) Establish a semi-federal national government before the autumn. (3) Allow German representatives to participate in the Marshall Plan Committee. (4) France has the right to participate in the meeting of senior officials of member states. (5) France has the right to veto all major decisions.</p>

The most popular candidates for the successor are Wedemeyer and Clark, but both Wedemeyer and Clark have stated that they are unwilling to take up this war.</p>

<h3>Britain Clarifies its Attitude Towards Italian Territories, Advocating Individual Handling, Hoping that Cyrenaica Will Be Trusteeshiped by Britain</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] The issue of dealing with former Italian colonies is still at a standstill after the UN Political Committee listened to conflicting proposals presented by the British and French representatives. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko has not yet presented the Soviet Union's views.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 7th] British Minister of State and Chief Representative to the UN McNeil stated in the Political Committee today when discussing the former colonies that Britain favors individual handling of the former colonies. Therefore, it is not easy to have a general method that can be applied to all former Italian colonies. As far as Libya is concerned, the Four-Power Investigation Committee found that the political intentions of the residents of the area differ from place to place. Therefore, these lands must be handled individually, but this does not deny the appropriateness of the entire Libya area still being unified in the end. As far as Cyrenaica is concerned, if the United Nations agency hands the area over to British governance, Britain will faithfully fulfill its trusteeship responsibilities, and Britain will recognize Senussi as the head of the country as much as possible. Regarding Tripolitania, Britain has not yet been able to put forward practical suggestions, but Britain is also unwilling to be the governing authority of the area for a long time. McNeil continued to mention Italian Somaliland, advocating that the area be handed over to Italian governance under the trusteeship of the United Nations. Regarding Italian Eritrea, Britain advocates that it be ceded to Abyssinia to fulfill the legitimate and reasonable demands of the country.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 7th] The UN Comprehensive Committee decided today to add the case of Cardinal Mindszenty of Hungary and the trial of priests in Bulgaria to the UN agenda. Eleven countries voted in favor, the Soviet Union and Poland voted against, and Iran abstained.

Chinese representative Gu Weijun also said that the case has aroused worldwide concern and should be discussed by the UN. Malik pointed out that adding the two cases to the UN agenda is a violation of the Charter, and the UN agency will inevitably become a place for defamation, which will result in the reputation of the UN being tarnished. The priests of Mindszenty and Bulgaria are not only criminals in the country, but also instigators of a new world war. The people of the world should thank Hungary and Bulgaria for bringing them to justice.

The industry hopes that essential dyes will be allowed to be imported freely, exports of cloth will be encouraged, and industrial loans will be relaxed.</p>
<p>Towel Blankets</p>
<p>Industry representatives stated that the raw materials for their industry are yarn, dyes, chemicals, and fuel. Finished products cannot be sold in the China market, and the selling price in Southeast Asia is lower than the cost, so they deeply feel the lack of sales channels. Most raw materials rely on imports, and they are unable to settle foreign exchange due to the surge in the US dollar, making it impossible to transfer certificates. The industry hopes to expand the scope of industrial loans, simplify procedures, and use machine factory buildings as collateral.</p>
<p>Handkerchiefs</p>
<p>Industry representatives stated that the main raw material is cotton yarn, requiring 3,500 pieces of cotton yarn every five months. The recent difficulties faced by the industry are sluggish sales, shortage of funds, and high interest rates. The main sales market for handkerchiefs is the Nanyang Islands, where current selling prices are lower than the cost. The industry hopes that the government will purchase and export according to the cost, and requests government loans.</p>
<p>Underwear</p>
<p>Industry representatives stated that the raw materials for their industry are caustic soda, bleaching powder, sulfuric acid, and dyes. They need fine yarn of 60 counts or higher, which can only be manufactured by the Fang Jian and Shenxin No. 9 factories in China, which is far from sufficient. Imports from foreign countries are not allowed, so they feel very difficult. Secondly, there is also a great shortage of coal. The industry needs 1,000 pieces of fine yarn and 650 tons of coal per month.</p>
<p>Camel Wool</p>
<p>Industry representatives stated that the raw materials for their industry are wool and cotton yarn, with a monthly requirement of 300,000 pounds of wool and 250,000 pounds of cotton yarn. The difficulties they face are limited stock, shortage of funds, heavy pressure from high interest rates, and sharp rise in foreign exchange rates. They hope that the government will launch industrial loan to save the crisis.</p>
<p>Spinning Yarn</p>
<p>Industry representatives stated that the raw material is cotton yarn. If fully operational, they can produce 3,067 pieces. Currently, due to the lack of sales channels in other areas and the lack of goods for manufacturing in the local processing plants, 70% of the factories are in a state of semi-shutdown. They request the authorities to increase the allocation quantity and loans.</p>
<p>Handmade Cotton Weaving</p>
<p>Industry representatives stated that the raw materials are cotton yarn and dyes. Currently, 70% of the factories are in a state of semi-shutdown. The industry hopes for national material exchange and large-scale industrial loans.</p>
<p>Today, a symposium on the supply and demand of raw materials for the chemical industry group will continue to be held. Those invited to attend will include the Dye Industry Association, household chemical product industry, chemical raw material industry, match industry, glass industry, and paper industry.</p>

<h3>市商會電請財政部　放寬票據抵用禁令</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the ban on using bills for offsetting on the same day be relaxed. The telegram stated: To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, according to a letter from the Fish Business Association of this city, it has been found that the financial authorities in this city recently suddenly announced a ban on using bills for offsetting on the same day, and usury has reached unprecedented levels, causing all industries and markets to stagnate and the financial situation to be extremely chaotic, causing unbearable suffering to all industries. The association, based on complaints from its member firms, convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors, who believed that the situation was dire and that if no remedial measures were taken quickly, the city's industry and commerce would face the risk of closing down completely. It was decided to write to the Chamber of Commerce to promptly develop countermeasures to alleviate commercial difficulties. At the same time, other industries have also come to the association to complain about the above situation. It has been found that cash is extremely scarce recently. The Central Bank can only provide commercial firms with 12% of their deposit withdrawals in cash and 8% in fixed-amount banknotes. Commercial firms then issue these amounts to their customers. That is, those in industry and commerce who have dealings with firms, even if they have sufficient funds deposited in the firms, can only obtain 20% of what they need. Under these circumstances, industry and commerce urgently need to issue bills based on their actual funds as a means of payment. Now, in this severe situation, thoroughly implementing the ban on not using them for offsetting on the same day is tantamount to strangling the throat of industry and commerce and putting them to death. The current tense situation, when industry and commerce are closing their doors and waiting for exhaustion, is different from the situation when the ban on using bills for offsetting on the same day was promulgated last year. Government should act according to the times, and how can we adhere to the old decree and not leave some leeway for industry and commerce? It is requested that the Ministry instruct the Shanghai Financial Administration to allow flexibility in the use of bills for offsetting by commercial firms, not to impose an extreme prohibition, and to allow each firm to carefully handle the matter based on the circumstances of its customers. In addition to the 27 reasons stipulated for dishonoring bills, it is also necessary to prevent them from creating excuses and dishonoring bills arbitrarily. At the same time, strict sanctions should be imposed on customers who issue bills to maintain bill credit, so that industry and commerce can still have access to turnover. In recent years, floating capital has been dispersed, and commercial firms have been unable to meet the needs of industry and commerce due to their weak capital. The Central Bank has also failed to fulfill its responsibility as a bank's bank, so that when industry and commerce have needs, the interest on each yuan of loan is at the highest level, two or three times higher than the interbank lending rate. Drinking poison is not voluntary, but is forced by the situation. The Ministry must negotiate with the Central Bank to fulfill its responsibility as a bank's bank and provide commercial firms with sufficient funds so that interbank lending rates can gradually fall back and market interest rates will not become rampant. In order to alleviate the suffering of industry and commerce, we humbly offer our humble opinions and respectfully request the Ministry to examine and adopt them. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce kowtows.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Lü Huifei, who impersonated economic police officers, searched for gold transactions, and kidnapped people for ransom, was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights by the District Court yesterday. The defendant had been unemployed for a long time and had no way to make a living. At about 6:00 PM in December last year, he impersonated an economic police officer and went to Fang Zijin Gold and Silver Shop on Henan Road to search for gold transactions. The staff in the shop did not investigate carefully and treated him with great courtesy. Lü immediately pulled out a gun and threatened them, forcing them to hand over four gold bars. The manager of the shop, Zheng Yuxiang, opened the silver box, and Lü knew that there were no gold bars in the shop. He then kidnapped the shop assistant Jin Chuxiang and left, instructing the shop to quickly find a way to borrow gold for ransom. After leaving the shop, he forced Jin Chuxiang to contact the shop by phone in the area of Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, and Henan Road, and then agreed to use six taels of gold for ransom, agreeing to deliver it at the entrance of the Great World.

They first took control of the entrance of the lane and were about to carry out door-to-door looting when they were discovered by patrolling police officers. They immediately rushed to the Tianshengqiao Police Station of the Zhabei Branch to report, and patrol officer Wang Jie led four police officers to surround and arrest them. Unexpectedly, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest as soon as they arrived. Because it was late at night and there were no street lights in the area, they were outnumbered.

<h3>三毛畫展花絮追記　監委感動願意宣傳　教授之女無錢出力</h3>
<p>The "San Mao's Life in Paintings" exhibition, sponsored by the China Welfare Fund, had an unexpectedly crowded opening day on Children's Day, and the order was somewhat chaotic. The staff at the venue were all sweating profusely.</p>
<p>Several paintings were squeezed down, causing the author of San Mao, Zhang Leping, to jump up and down in a panic.</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, Wang Xiaolai arrived and held up the Yibao watercolor painting, but was imprisoned in the crowd by the audience.</p>
<p>The famous drama actress Ms. Yin Qing sympathized with San Mao and volunteered to do the voice-over at the venue. Her Beijing accent was pleasant and moving.</p>
<p>The voice-over was fruitful. Two young brothers, eight or nine years old, automatically joined the "San Mao Paradise Association" to become friends of "San Mao".</p>
<p>It was difficult for reporters from various newspapers to move around in the crowd. The photographers were afraid of squeezing their cameras and raised their hands high, looking for lenses, like strongmen performing weightlifting.</p>
<p>On the second day of the art exhibition, although there were many viewers, the order had improved. Zhang Leping sat down leisurely, with a faint smile on his face.</p>
<p>One of the viewers, Hu Dalin, adopted four "San Mao". He had four sons, and each son helped one "San Mao". It is hoped that he will have a few more sons so that he can become an honorary member.</p>
<p>Greedy to watch San Mao, forgot his son</p>
<p>San Mao's paintings are indeed fascinating. One gentleman forgot his son while watching them.</p>
<p>Ms. Yin Qing reported to the audience, please claim the lost children, the effect was particularly good, someone came to claim them within seconds, and the poor San Mao present looked extremely envious.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhou Dengmanwen automatically joined the San Mao Paradise Association as a friend of "San Mao", buying two volumes of San Mao's Wanderings on the spot with one silver dollar, and declaring that she would recruit members for the association.</p>
<p>The third day of the art exhibition had more viewers than the second day.</p>
<p>Someone picked up a small coat and handed it to the information desk. Ms. Yin Qing mistakenly thought it was donated to the association and immediately wrote a receipt.</p>
<p>One viewer brought a large package of old clothes to the venue to donate to the poor San Mao.</p>
<p>The loudspeaker reported that the Shen Bao news column had received a message of donation from reader Mr. Gao Cide, which moved the audience.</p>
<p>Bank colleagues, joint membership</p>
<p>On the fourth day of the art exhibition, twelve colleagues from a certain bank jointly assisted three San Mao every month, becoming three ordinary members together.</p>
<p>After viewing, Supervisory Committee member Liu Pingjiang was moved and purchased a copy of San Mao's Wanderings for resale for 10,000 yuan, and was willing to promote the San Mao Paradise Association and solicit members.</p>
<p>A friend Wang sent a package of pencils and exercise books to be a friend of San Mao.</p>
<p>The daughter of a professor from Jiaotong University came to the venue to volunteer to help. She said that her father was a poor professor, and she had no strength to donate money, but was willing to contribute her labor, and her eyes were red. It was truly touching.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang, the manager of a certain company, lingered in front of the charity paintings for a long time, unwilling to leave. As a result, he ordered them for 5 million yuan, got the painting he loved, and saved the suffering San Mao.</p>
<p>The fifth day of the art exhibition was still a great success. The first San Mao sympathizer was a foreign lady, Ms. Kai, from Jardine Matheson, who spent one million yuan to order a charity painting and was willing to help solicit members. There have been four people who have ordered the painting before and after.</p>
<p>Far from the target, hoping to join hands in charity</p>
<p>Students from Jiangwan Middle School donated a sum of money collectively after visiting the venue.</p>
<p>It is reported that more than 200 people have joined the San Mao Paradise Association as San Mao members in recent days, and about 200 San Mao have been adopted. The association's target is to rescue 500 "San Mao" before the end of this month, and the current results are still far from the target. Judging from the grand occasion of the art exhibition in the past five days, Zhang Leping's San Mao can get such widespread sympathy, and it is believed that tens of thousands of suffering San Mao in Shanghai will surely get more widespread sympathy. The China Welfare Fund has established the San Mao Paradise Association for these suffering San Mao and is publicly soliciting members. The monthly membership fee for ordinary members is equivalent to three silver dollars in gold yuan notes, which can rescue one San Mao. If you can rescue five or more San Mao every month, you are an honorary member. If you can donate materials and money in irregular amounts at any time, you are a "San Mao" friend. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will actively participate and join hands in charity. The address of the San Mao Paradise Association is No. 9806-7, Central Lin Sen Road.</p>
<h3>皇後戲院觀劇糾紛　憲兵機警未肇禍端</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At the Queen's Theater on Xizang Road at about 2:15 PM yesterday, five soldiers wanted to enter the theater to watch a play. The theater explained that the reception for soldiers was in the morning, the time had passed, and it was already full, so they could not be entertained and asked for forgiveness, but to no avail. They reported to the military police stationed in the theater, and squad leader Zhang Zicheng advised them gently. Unexpectedly, one of the soldiers took off two hand grenades and put them in his military pants pockets. After a while, he took out one and was about to throw it. Fortunately, squad leader Zhang was alert and immediately stepped forward and hugged him around the waist, preventing the disaster. At that time, the military police fired five shots into the air to deter the mob and arrested four people on the spot, including Huang Junjie (the one who intended to throw the grenade, 20 years old, from Sichuan), Wei Deqing (19 years old, from Sichuan), Chen Ruifu (24 years old, from Sichuan), and Zhu Yunfei (18 years old, from Sichuan). Another person escaped. The above four people were taken to the Penglai Road Military Police Team in Nanshi for interrogation and then sent to the Garrison Command for punishment.</p>

<h3>The Jinji Lake Drowning Case: Confusing and Unpredictable, The Truth is Revealed, Four Criminals Executed</h3>
<p>— Yang Xiu Kou</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Report, 5th] On the evening of January 1st of this year, a bloody murder and robbery occurred at Jinji Lake outside the Fengmen Gate here. A fishing boat was robbed, and the four men and women on board were strangled to death by the robbers and their bodies dumped into the lake. Afterward, the criminal police team conducted extensive investigations and arrested the main culprit, Sun Fulou, and three others. After a thorough interrogation, all the criminals confessed. Just as the authorities were preparing to impose the death penalty, a man named Zhang Shizi surrendered to the District Court, claiming that the real culprits were not Sun Fulou and others, but rather Wang Zhaomin and Li Tongfa, who were informants for the criminal police. This led to the overturning of the entire case. However, during the court hearing, Zhang Shizi recanted his previous confession, creating a confusing and unpredictable situation that shocked the entire Wu region. During the final court session on the 1st of this month, the audience was packed, all eager to see the faces of these murderers. The details of the case from beginning to end are recorded below:</p>
<p>Six people, Zhang Xinsheng, Wang A'er, Zhu Boqing, Yao Ximing, Zhu Fusheng, and Zhen Liansheng, who resided outside the Fengmen Gate and made a living by jointly operating a fish and shrimp business, frequently traveled between Suzhou and Hankou. On New Year's Day, they purchased over 20 catties of fresh fish and 280 catties of shrimp, worth over 10,000 gold yuan, from Renchang Firm at No. 17 Chaotian Road outside the Fengmen Gate. They packed the goods into four rattan baskets and had Li Jinnan's wooden boat load them. Shareholders Zhang Xinsheng and Wang A'er were responsible for escorting the goods to Suzhou Railway Station for transshipment to Shanghai for sale. The boat owner, assisted by his wife's younger sister, Xu Linmei, rowed the boat. The boat departed around 6 PM, but it did not return the next day. The mother of the boat owner, Li Jinnan, went to Renchang Fish Firm to inquire, but they also had no news. So, she searched everywhere until January 3rd, when she found the boat, which had set out on New Year's Day, near Jiangxiang River along Jinji Lake. Only three hats and a pair of women's shoes were left on board. The whereabouts of the boat owner Li Nannan, Xu Linmei, and the fish merchants Zhang Xinsheng and Wang A'er were unknown. Sensing something was amiss, she returned to the fish firm to report. The firm immediately hired employees to inspect Jinji Lake. According to nearby residents, fishermen had discovered a heavy object while fishing two days prior. Thinking it was a large fish, they hooked it up, only to find four human corpses. The boatmen were shocked and dared not speak out for fear of getting involved. They threw the bodies back into the water. When the shareholders of the fish business, Zhu Boqing, and others learned of this, they hired boats to search for a day on the 4th, but found nothing. On the 5th, they hired more boats and used grappling hooks. Around 2 PM, they finally pulled up two corpses in the lake, identifying them as Zhang Xinsheng and Wang A'er, the fish merchants who had been escorting the goods. The faces of the two corpses were swollen and purple, with scratches from hands. Their entire bodies were bound with hemp ropes, and their necks were also tightly strangled with hemp ropes. The sight was gruesome, indicating that they had been strangled to death and their bodies dumped to cover up the crime. On the 7th, the search continued, and the bodies of Li Jinnan and Xu Linmei were also recovered. These two corpses were in even worse condition than the previous two, being bound together. After the incident, on the 8th, detectives obtained leads and, accompanied by informants Wang Zhaomin and Li Tongfa, went to the countryside and arrested the main suspects Sun Jinxing (Kou Mei), Sun Xiaomei, and Wu Jinxiang, all migrants from Shandong, in Weiting Zhengyi. There were still accomplices in Chefang and Jiaozhi. The criminal police set out again to investigate and arrest, and on the 9th, they arrested Sun Fulou, who had initiated the crime. There were still accomplices, Tang Liansheng and Sun Xingtao, who had not been apprehended. The four criminals were extremely cunning and refused to reveal the truth. So, Team Leader Su Gengsheng devised a plan, ordering the criminal police to take Sun Koumei to the vacant lot in the back garden, order him to lie face down on the ground, cover him with old cotton clothes to fake his death, and fire two shots into the ground. Afterward, Sun Xiaomei and Wu Jinxiang were brought in and told that the Sun had been executed on orders. Upon seeing this, the three criminals trembled all over and confessed to the entire crime, admitting that during the robbery, Sun and others recognized Zhang Xinsheng and others, so they intended to silence them. Based on the confession, the criminal police immediately took the criminals to the countryside to retrieve the original items, such as leather robes. At this point, the entire case was brought to light. Police Chief Wu believed that the four criminals had committed heinous crimes and decided to impose the death penalty, intending to report to the First Pacification Zone Headquarters for approval before executing them by firing squad to appease public outrage.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on February 18th, a major change occurred in the case. The wives of the four criminals, Sun Yangshi and Sun Daishi, jointly submitted petitions to the County Council, the Police Department, the Court, and other agencies, appealing for justice, claiming that Sun Fulou and others had been falsely accused and wrongly imprisoned. The main culprits in the case were the informants Wang Zhaomin and Li Tongfa, who had private feuds and were using this as revenge by falsely implicating them. They claimed that after Sun and others were arrested, Wang Zhaomin, along with Wang Laoer, who claimed to be a criminal police officer, and Li Tongfa had repeatedly raped Sun Daishi, Sun Yangshi, and others. They requested that the court interrogate Sun and others. On the same day, another boatman, Zhang Shizi, surrendered to the District Prosecutor's Office, claiming that the four criminals arrested by the criminal police team were innocent and that the real criminals were indeed Wang Zhaomin, Li Tongfa, and three other unnamed people. Because Zhang Shizi was taken by them to row the boat that day. After questioning by Prosecutor Pan, he was temporarily detained. Because it was exactly the opposite of the previous case, he immediately telegraphed the criminal police team to bring Wang and Li to investigate the case. According to Li Tongfa: "I have always had a good relationship with Sun Xiaomei. In the first month of the lunar calendar last year, I borrowed 400 gold yuan from Sun. Sun said he didn't have any money on hand. On the seventh day of the month, Sun Xiaomei borrowed me 400 yuan. On the eleventh day, when I returned the money to Sun, Sun said that the money didn't need to be repaid. Recently, a batch of fresh shrimp was sold, and I had plenty of money in hand. At that time, I asked Sun why he always only caught fish, not shrimp, so why did he have shrimp to sell this time? He told me that he had opened a business in Jinji Lake, so I knew that Sun had done this case." This case was like a sudden rise of a strange peak, with twists and turns, making people feel confused and unpredictable, and it was difficult to distinguish right from wrong. Although there were several investigations, it was difficult to reveal the truth.</p>
<p>On March 7, the case was reopened for investigation, and there was a major development. When the prosecutor interrogated Zhang Shizi alone, Zhang said in his confession that after entering prison, Sun Yangshi and others did not pay him a penny for his life, so he gradually regretted it and revealed the truth. At this point, the confusing murder case was truly revealed.</p>
<p>The court immediately proceeded in three directions. Sun Fulou and six others (two are still at large) were prosecuted for robbery. Wang Zhaomin and Li Tongfa were prosecuted separately for the part of the case where they were accused of forced gang rape and disturbing public morals by Sun Tangshi. Zhang Shizi's false accusation was also prosecuted according to law. After two court hearings on March 31 and April 1, the case was declared closed due to conclusive evidence. On April 4, the verdict was announced: "Sun Koumei, Sun Xiaomei, Wu Jinxiang, and Sun Fulou jointly committed robbery and intentional homicide. Each is sentenced to death, with deprivation of civil rights for life."</p>

After interrogation by Chen Honglu, the county magistrate and military judge, they were sentenced to death. The sentence was approved by the Provincial Garrison Headquarters. At 10 AM on the morning of the 7th, the two bandits were escorted to the open space at Beichengzha Bridge and executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>The Spring Breeze Permeates Inside and Outside Suzhou City, Some Scenic Spots in the Suburbs Still Feel Like Walking on Thorns</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Yang Wenyu</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Report, 5th] Let's copy a cliché that describes Suzhou's scenic spots: "Suzhou is the capital of Wu during the Spring and Autumn Period, controlling the thoroughfare of three rivers and located at the confluence of five lakes. The mountains and rivers are beautiful, and the people are elegant and refined. Beside the city of King Wu, willows form embankments. In front of Qi Nu's gate, clear waves lap the shore. Thousands of beauties in green sleeves are up and down the buildings. Suzhou has always been full of beauties. Anchor at Maple Bridge to hear the midnight bell, climb Tiger Hill to listen to Master Sheng's Buddhist teachings, walk through the corridors of Lingyan Temple, and explore the fragrant snow plum blossoms of Dengwei. The eastern and western Dongting Islands are beautiful in Wu and Yue, enough to evoke distant thoughts and broaden the mind. Other famous gardens such as Canglang Pavilion, Lion Grove Garden, Liuyuan, and Yiyuan are all excellent." In just over a hundred words, it covers all of Suzhou's scenic spots and customs. However, these enticing and glamorous words can only be imagined, and you can no longer find them in today's Suzhou. But the reason why Suzhou can still attract countless ladies during the Spring and Autumn Festival, in my opinion, is simply because it has some grass, trees, mountains, and water, which seems to allow people who have lived in the city for a long time to come here to enjoy some freshness!</p>
<p>The rapid change in the war situation has made the once peaceful paradise of Jiangnan also smell the gunpowder. Therefore, the previous wave of fleeing, like an infectious disease, spread everywhere. Airplanes, ships, and trains were packed, and of course, Suzhou's only "freshness" that could maintain the seaside ladies was no longer something people had the leisure to enjoy. I remember at this time last year, people poured into Suzhou from the Beijing-Shanghai line like a tidal wave. The strangely dressed, willow-waisted, and crimson-lipped Shanghai-style women almost caused a revolution in the ancient Suzhou society, both crazy and stimulating. Streamlined cars drove on the few streets here, and Suzhou seemed to be a prisoner of the banknotes in their hands, a dazzling arrogance!</p>
<p>Travelers to Suzhou inevitably patronize a few shops here: Caizhiqi's melon seeds and candies, Ma Yongqi's soy sauce chicken and soy sauce duck, have a meal at Songhelou, and taste a bowl of noodles at Zhu Hongxing, as if it were a "compulsory course" in school. Therefore, for many years, these shops have regarded this business as the peak season of their annual operations. The sales of goods have no accurate statistics, but it is said that Zhu Hongxing Noodle Company has more small accounts than all the food restaurants in Suzhou. However, the situation today is very different from previous years. The Shanghai-style ladies with characteristic features are rarely found on the streets, and the car formation at the entrance of the restaurant has also disappeared from its former magnificence. Occasionally, some people do some embellishments, and rather than being eye-catching, it is more of a sorrow for the general businesses in Suzhou. On the other hand, a group of wealthy rural old women, wearing yellow cloth and carrying sachets, are everywhere. They go to Hangzhou, Changzhou Tianning Temple, Wuxi Chong'an Temple, or Pingwang Du Dui Lake. When they pass by Suzhou, they must visit Xuanmiao Temple. They only need to "kill a few heads" (silver dollars), and no one can be as carefree as them!</p>
<p>In recent centuries, countless temples and palaces have been added in Suzhou, and the number of gardens and residences is even more uncountable. Initially, these gardens were private properties set up by romantic scholars and local gentry for their own enjoyment. However, in recent years, they have all been opened for public viewing. Unfortunately, there are only people watching, but no one managing them. Moreover, due to frequent years of war and chaos, some are desolate, and some are dilapidated. Appreciation has become a lament. The lazy character of Suzhou people is fully expressed in these places. If desolation is also a kind of beauty, then you can go and see Liuyuan and Canglang Pavilion, with a few rotten wooden buildings and dilapidated balls. The design of Yiyuan is exquisite, but it has now been used as the campus of Henan University. In comparison, the strange architecture of Lion Grove Garden is still worth seeing because there is not much destruction. The sunny weather these days has filled the forest with groups of people going on spring outings.</p>
<p>In fact, the best places in Suzhou are all in the suburbs. However, many places already give people the feeling of walking on thorns. Exploring the plum blossoms of Dengwei should have been at the top of the itinerary, but half of the plum trees were destroyed by the Japanese. Now, a temporary middle school has been established on the nearby Xuanmu Mountain, and the cadre training class of Qiu Qingquan will soon be stationed on Qionglong Mountain. The green mountains remain the same, but the scenery is very different. In addition, since it is near Taihu Lake, public security is a major problem. Originally, there were several buses a day between Suzhou and Guangfu, but now there is only one left. Since transportation is inconvenient, tourists are also hesitant to go. Of course, there are plenty of people who can afford to hire a car, but it is necessary to consider whether the sightseeing is like an adventure. A friend told me that as long as the situation is calm, Guangfu and Dengwei are worth a trip in the season when yangmei are red and loquats are yellow. Lingyan Mountain, 25 miles west of the city, can be reached by car via Mudu in just half an hour. Although rickshaws can also go back and forth, the cost is three silver dollars. Some time ago, a group of people who took a horse-drawn carriage to visit Mudu encountered a robbery on the way back and lost a lot of money. It is said that the business of the popular Shijia Restaurant in Mudu is much worse than in previous years. As for Tianping Mountain, which is still west of Lingyan, although it has White Cloud Spring, Lotus Cave, and the towering strange rocks of the Tou Tuo Cliff on Feilai Peak for tourists to climb, the number of people going to Lingyan is much less than before, and it is undoubtedly worse to go to Tianping.</p>
<p>Su Dongpo said: "It is a shortcoming not to visit Tiger Hill when visiting Suzhou." "Geographical advantage" makes Tiger Hill a place that Suzhou women must visit today. Rickshaw drivers solicit business in front of the temple, and the words "Tiger Hill" are shouted the loudest. It is close to the city, and any car can be used. Moreover, there are many historical sites, and the guides can recite endlessly, such as the beginning and end of Tang Bohu's Three Smiles affair; the ruins of Bai Gongdi in the Tang Dynasty where cranes were raised; the ancient relics of the Six Dynasties such as Tiger Hill Pagoda, Sheng Gongtai, and Nodding Stone; and even the ruins of the Zhou and Qin dynasties such as Sword Pond and Sword Testing Stone, etc. Emperors of past dynasties have also visited it many times. In short, Tiger Hill never gives you boredom. Moreover, from an economic and convenient point of view, it is quite worthwhile. During the Qingming Festival, people going on spring outings are shoulder-to-shoulder on Tiger Hill Road, and it will crowd you dizzy. It is said that this grand occasion occurs every year. At the same time, dozens of fire engines go to Cuihuashanzhuang in Tiger Hill to sweep the public cemetery, which makes it even more lively. Vendors gather, forming a large market. Countless beggars follow tourists and refuse to let go. Flower girls use the soft language of Wu to pester you like toffee... There is a fun like attending a temple fair.</p>

<h3>The Silent Countryside of Nanxun</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou, May 5th by This Newspaper] Nanxun, a new poet, Xu Chi, once said in one of his articles: "Nanxun is a silent countryside. Silence and loneliness are unbearable." In its former history, Nanxun was extraordinarily glorious and prosperous. Starting from the late Qing Dynasty, it made a fortune by transporting official salt, and further earned money by running businesses in various places. Its silk was also famous internationally, bringing back a lot of foreign exchange. It simply became the richest town in the world. The big tycoons were known as "four elephants, eight oxen, and seventy-two scorched yellow dogs." Those whose assets were above one million silver dollars were only referred to as "one dog," and there were as many as seventy-two dogs.</p>
<p>Liu, Pang, Zhang, and Gu</p>
<p>The so-called "four elephants" refer to the four surnames: "Liu, Pang, Zhang, and Gu." In those years, in Nanxun, in addition to competing to build grand mansions, they also competed to build private gardens. For example, the Liu family built Xiaoyun Villa, with pavilions, terraces, towers, and various flowers. The Pang family then built Yi Garden, which was even larger than Xiaoyun Villa. The Zhang family, envious of the Pang family's Yi Garden, then built an even larger garden than the Pang family's. They put a lot of thought into naming it, and later came up with the two characters "Shi Yi" (Suitable Yi), with "Shi" above "Yi," hence the name "Shi Garden." The Gu family then also built a unique garden. The Liu family felt that their own Xiaoyun Villa was inferior, so they expanded it into "Nan Garden." There were as many as six private gardens in Nanxun due to this competition.</p>
<p>These many wealthy families, in addition to building houses for rent in the city to digest their swelling wealth, so the houses on both sides of Hengma Road and Tongfu Road near the famous Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai were built solely by the Liu family, and the famous Huile Lane on Fourth Road was also built solely by the Liu family.</p>
<p>Watching Silkworms and Reeling Silk</p>
<p>Nanxun itself produces fish, sheep, chickens, and ducks in large quantities. The silk includes the famous Jili silk. The so-called "Jili" refers to a "Yang" (whirlpool). When water flows through seven "Yang," the water quality is naturally very clear. The silk produced there has round fibers and is tough. A single strand of silk can hold a copper coin and reach more than five feet in length. Speaking of Nanxun silk, as early as the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, people were watching silkworms and reeling silk. After the Taiping Rebellion, Wu and Li Songjun came to Nanxun, bringing mulberry seedlings and silkworm eggs to Japan to exchange for Kanei copper coins and kelp. In 1920, the United States specially organized a tourist group to visit Nanxun. At this time, all the silk was shipped to America via France. Later, French silk stockings became popular, with each dozen costing as much as 1,500 US dollars. The silk used for weaving stockings had to be uniform and clean. Nanxun mostly produced local silk, and the market was gradually taken over by Japanese silk. The best Japanese "White Tail Silkworm" breed came from Nanxun. Unfortunately, it is now lost in Nanxun. In the era when Nanxun silk was sold extensively overseas, the Mei brand silk produced by Mei Hengyu was famous internationally. Each dan (unit of weight) of Jili silk was worth 950 customs taels of silver, and even reached 990 taels, but this period was very short, and soon the price fell. During the peak sales period, exports amounted to tens of thousands of packages. Assuming the US silk market had ten shares, China occupied seven shares. Later, it fell to one-eighth, and each package was worth only 360 French francs, which was before 1937. Besides earning foreign exchange by selling silk, many people also made fortunes from producing silkworm eggs because the long-distance sales yielded substantial profits. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Primary School Students Escort Lost Dog Home; Decline Reward and Donate to Charity</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>My little dog was lost last night. I searched everywhere this morning without success. Feeling exhausted, I planned to rest at the Shanghai Grand Theatre. When I passed the Yiyuan Hotel, I saw three Chinese students leading the dog. I immediately went up to inquire. They said, "The dog was taken away by a beggar with a rope last night. We rescued the dog and found your address at the information office and planned to bring it to you." I was touched by their enthusiasm and wanted to thank them immediately, but they refused. Therefore, I am presenting 100,000 gold yuan to the Sanmao Children's Welfare Foundation (founded by Madame Sun and Mr. Zhang Leping). Please forward it on my behalf and publish this letter to express my highest gratitude to these three students.</p>

<h3>The Price of Gold Rises All the Way; The National Bank Sells Unrestrictedly at a Price of 2.25 Million; Jewelry Gold Fluctuates Violently, Silver Shops Suspend Quotations in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market gradually returned to normal, and settlements were made with current day banknotes and application forms. The opening in the morning was stable, at 1.89 million, slightly decreasing to 1.886 million. Midway, due to loose funds and frequent positive news, it rose all the way to 1.9001 million, reaching the upper limit again. Around noon, the Central Bank planned to sell a large amount of gold again, but only accepted banknotes or cash from the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank, which caused the industry to be unable to accept it. Trading stalled in the afternoon, and transactions came to a standstill again. More than ten large bars were traded in the morning, which was 20% higher than the previous day. Over-the-counter trading was brisk, and fluctuations were violent. Due to various rumors about crossing the river, people were uneasy. Various gangs had high morale, opening at 1.9 million, 1.95 million, once retreating to 1.88 million, 1.93 million, and then rising straight to 2.5 million, 2.55 million at the noon close. In the afternoon, the Central Bank sold without restrictions at a price of 2.25 million, secretly releasing 1,000 to 2,000 bars, and the upward trend slowed slightly. Opening at 2.4 million, 2.45 million, gradually declining to 2.21 million, 2.24 million, and closing slightly higher at 2.28 million, 2.31 million, an increase of 380,000 compared to the previous day. The overnight interest rate was increased by 260,000, and shouted as high as 2.44 million, 2.47 million.</p>
<p>[Report from the China News Agency] The gold market has not yet returned to normal since the Central Bank sold gold on the 4th. The reason is that gold shops are deeply afraid of the Central Bank's further malicious actions, so they are unwilling to trade in the market and have shifted the focus of transactions to over-the-counter, causing the market to come to a standstill. Active over-the-counter trading has had a significant impact on general prices. According to relevant sources, the Central Bank believes that over-the-counter trading is becoming rampant, disrupting the financial system, so it may carry out a considerable reorganization of the gold market to ensure that gold market transactions return to normal. It is said that this measure will be officially announced soon.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the price of gold jewelry in silver shops fluctuated violently, changing three times in the morning. At 10 o'clock, it was quoted at 1.85 million, 2.05 million; at 11 o'clock, it rose to 1.95 million, 2.15 million; and by noon, it was as high as 2.05 million, 2.25 million. In the afternoon, due to the chaotic market and brisk sales, there were few imports and many exports, and the supply and demand were out of balance, so all shops temporarily suspended quoting prices for business. It rose by 430,000 compared to the previous day, and silver jewelry also rose to 20,000, 25,000, an increase of 4,000.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Plunge</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday's silver dollar arbitrage had few transactions due to the low price of silver dollars in other ports, but it was still more cost-effective than gold yuan arbitrage. The gang sold out, and the remittance fee was directly over. Hankou sold out at 98 yuan, a premium of 2 yuan. Tianjin sold out US dollar remittances, at 1 yuan per 100 yuan. Due to price differences between the two places, silver dollar arbitrage was also done by exchanging silver dollars, with the other party taking US dollars, at a ratio of 2 yuan to 1. Although this arbitrage method is an innovative way to maintain the value of the currency, it is still done sporadically. Also, the remittance rate for silver dollar arbitrage in Wanxian was 96.75%.</p>
<p>Street trading fluctuated suddenly. It was still stable in the morning, with "big heads" (referring to a type of silver dollar) quoted at 34,000, 36,000. Around 10 o'clock, due to the sharp rise in gold prices and active demand, it quickly caught up and broke through four levels, reaching as high as 44,500, 45,500 near noon. Trading was chaotic in the afternoon, once reaching 49,000, 51,000. By evening, there were more floating profits, slightly lower at 44,000, 46,000. "Small heads" (another type of silver dollar) were quoted at 37,000, 39,000. Dragon and Eagle coins were quoted at 30,000, 32,000. For banknote trading, "big heads" once reached as high as 51,000, 53,000. In the afternoon, the overnight price was shouted down to 47,000, 49,000, a significant jump of 10,000 compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, over-the-counter trading of US dollars was still rare, with a more solid base than gold. Large transactions were quiet, and mostly small amounts were bought and sold. The morning opening was at 39,000, 41,000, falling to 38,000, 40,000. The noon close was high at 53,000, 55,000. The afternoon opening was at 52,000, 54,000, falling to 49,000, 51,000 at the close. It was 900 higher than the previous day. The overnight interest rate was 3,500, shouted at 52,500, 54,500.</p>
<h3>Chaotic Over-the-Counter Bidding; No Rice Market Trading Yesterday; Flour and Cooking Oil Prices Soar Uncontrollably</h3>
<p>Due to price limits in the rice market, prices in producing areas and other industries soared, and merchants could not trade at the price limits, so market trading was effectively suspended. Suburban rice prices rose sharply and chaotically due to high prices in producing areas and rising prices of gold, banknotes, and other goods. White japonica and thin japonica were quoted at 220,000 and 110,000 respectively, and early rice at 210,000 and 200,500, all soaring by more than 20%.</p>
<p>Cooking oil prices soared, due to loose credit, rising prices of all goods, and oil prices were even more affected by the lack of imported goods and low inventories, and merchants were hoarding goods, so the rise was even more severe. Soybean oil closed at 1.36 million, and rapeseed oil at 1.17 million, each rising by 25% to 30%. Jibucket rapeseed oil was 1.35 million, and all goods rose by 25% to 30%. Soybean cake had a customer base and increased sharply by 40%.</p>
<p>Flour followed gold, and the market trend rose sharply by 30%. After the opening, the demand from the booming utility industry surged, and over-the-counter bidding was alarming. The money market was loose, and buying interest was strong, so merchants were very strong in raising prices. The prices of various brands of flour gradually increased after the opening. Laoche (Old Car) brand once reached a high of 87,000, and closed at 85,500 yuan after hearing that the Central Bank was selling. Binship (Warship) closed at 83,500 yuan, and the outer skin knocked on the seventh level, and the over-the-counter price continued to rise.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains rose across the board. Soybeans rose sharply by 40% due to the surge in oil cake. Cart soybeans rose to 220,000, and winter soybeans were shouted as high as 230,000 in the over-the-counter market. Raw peanuts rose by more than 100,000, and Yangzhou Tizhuang broke the 500,000 mark. Corn and sorghum generally rose by 30%, and there were few sesame transactions.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Rises Consistently; Cloth Advances Rapidly at High Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was flying high. The initial opening was still stable, but later, stimulated by the sharp rise in gold prices, people were panicked, and holders raised prices unanimously. The industry tried their best to collect goods, and market prices jumped wildly. As a result, various yarns rose sharply by 20% to 40%.</p>
<p>42-count Lanfeng brand skyrocketed from 11.5 million to 14 million, an increase of 3.5 million, and 40-count Lanfeng broke through the 13 million mark, reaching a new high. 32-count Yinyue (Silver Moon) initially opened at 7.5 million, and finally knocked on the 9 million mark, a rise of 2.1 million.</p>
<p>21-count Shuangma (Double Horse) spot goods initially traded at 5.85 million, reaching a high of 7.6 million, and closed at 7.4 million at noon, a rise of 2.25 million. Prices for 20-count of each grade all rose by 30%, and other yarns all reached unprecedented new highs. In the afternoon, due to the decline in gold prices, people became more cautious, and 21-count Shuangma was sold for 7 million over-the-counter.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market continued to be firm and elegant. The money market was loose, and purchases from the market and customers increased, and buying interest was renewed. The market trend suddenly became brisk, and prices of various cloths advanced rapidly towards high prices near the close.</p>
<p>In the morning, Longtou (Dragon Head) fine cloth traded at 238,000 yuan, rising to 252,000 yuan, and near noon it fell back to 228,000 yuan. By the close, due to fluctuations in various over-the-counter goods and people's spirits being boosted, the industry absorbed aggressively, and prices reached a new high of 250,000 yuan, an increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day's over-the-counter market.</p>
<p>Sijunzi (Four Gentlemen) serge rose from 227,500 yuan to a high of 238,000 yuan. Later, it fell to 220,500 yuan, and closed at 236,000 yuan at noon, an increase of 5,000 yuan. 190 high-end shilin broke through the 543,000 yuan mark, reaching a new peak. Later, there was another sharp jump in the over-the-counter market. Around 3 o'clock, Longtou fine cloth even knocked on 310,000 yuan, and Sijunzi serge was 295,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Rise</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Chinese stock market initially softened and then strengthened in the morning, and continued to rise in the afternoon. Initially, it was rumored that over-the-counter gold was soaring, funds flowed out from the industry, and large investors continued to sell and suppress the market whenever prices were high, and the market situation repeatedly showed weakness. However, due to the large amount of money from banks and the easing of credit, the implicit interest rate dropped sharply, and the surface sentiment was slightly boosted. New buying followed, and the market turned abruptly better near the close. Yongsha opened in the morning at 20.05 yuan, and banks vigorously entered when prices were low, pulling up the market trend, rising to 22.7 yuan. Over-the-counter counterparty gangs continued to sell, and it fluctuated around 21 yuan, hovering weakly. It was unable to stand firm at the peak. Near noon, gold prices rose to the peak, and people feared being suppressed, selling gold and buying stocks, and gold gang funds moved in. The bulls turned around and short squeezed, and the surface buying interest suddenly became strong, and the market trend soared, closing as high as 24.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The trend of small and medium-sized stocks initially softened and then strengthened, and all rose sharply at noon. Xinho initially opened at 4.8 yuan, rising to 5.5 yuan. Xinguang initially opened at 1.6 yuan, rising to 1.75 yuan. Jingfu rose from 0.76 yuan to 0.845 yuan. Qinhe rose from 0.85 yuan to 1.05 yuan. Meiya initially opened at 4.9 yuan and rose to 6 yuan at noon. Jinglun initially opened at 5.5 yuan, falling to 4.7 yuan, the limit down. Near the close, various stocks rose, breaking through the limit again, and finally closed at 5 yuan.</p>
<p>The over-the-counter market sentiment remained good in the afternoon due to the brisk purchases near the close in the morning. Moreover, because trading on Friday afternoon can be extended to Monday of next week, it triggered a buying spree, and Yongsha continued to rise after opening. It was once weak in the middle, but still stood firm near the close, closing at 25.8 yuan. Except for Meiya, which was slightly soft, other stocks all continued to rise. The total turnover for the day was 4.16585 billion shares.</p>
<p>Gold bonds Yesterday, gold prices soared and sentiment was brisk. The market buying interest was relatively strong, and it rose again at noon. The morning opening was bid at 800,000 and offered at 840,000, but no transaction was heard. As gold prices continued to rise, rising to 950,000, it closed at 970,000 at noon, an increase of 110,000 yuan. The afternoon opened at 930,000, but due to the small return in gold prices, sentiment turned stagnant, shouting low at 900,000, and then rising to 950,000 at the close.</p>
<p>The trend of foreign stocks continued to rise as the silver shops eased up. It rose sharply again at noon. Yisha traded at 62,000 yuan, 64,000 yuan, up another 15,000 yuan. Yinglian was 67,000 yuan, 70,000 yuan, also up 15,000 yuan. Yipi was 11,000 yuan, 12,000 yuan, up 12,000 yuan. Huidifeng was bid at 210,000 yuan, and Yazhou was offered at 6,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll</h3>
<p>— A Spectator</p>
<p>News Fever; The Market Goes Crazy Again</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, the market went crazy again, retreating slightly near the evening, as if hesitant. But the underlying trend is quite tight; it must be related to the overall situation.</p>
<p>When listening to news about the overall situation, one should be very calm. There will be ups and downs, so people running around in the market should make up their minds.</p>
<p>Now, because of the following two reasons, it is no longer a time to do short-term trading. Once you make up your mind, doing long-term trading can be done with peace of mind and can make money effortlessly.</p>
<p>The first point to pay attention to when doing long-term trading is high interest rates. Yesterday, most prices fluctuated by 20-30%, partly to compensate for the interest arrears from the early-week trend; the other part is anticipating a tightening period before mid-month. Various industries that need to ship goods to free up money to pay wages need to raise prices to unload goods and release interest for a week. This has been the usual practice in recent months, and we have pointed it out several times. Now is that time again.</p>
<p>The second point to pay attention to when doing long-term trading is that preserving assets is more important than preserving currency value. Swap heavy items for light ones, light ones for exquisite ones, and exquisite ones for flexible and lively ones. So, in the midst of all the craziness, you still have to see clearly and recognize accurately. Those who blindly follow will end up wearing wet clothes.</p>
<p>If you are looking at short-term trading, then the mid-month funds transfer to pay salaries is more important than the overall situation.</p>
<p>In the past few market dynamics before salary payments, the closer it got to the salary payment period, the tighter the credit and the higher the interest rate; while prices fell behind. Therefore, most employers sold goods consecutively at high prices to release interest one week before the salary payment; and transferred the interest on the loan. In this way, in principle, there should be more funds and the cost of borrowing lower, but why is the opposite true? Because most people are releasing goods for the transfer, so the prices are soft, and because prices are soft, people who want to release goods but are hesitant feel the urgency of needing funds. This market contradiction forms the special trend in the week before salary payment.</p>
<p>Releasing goods and transferring funds one week before salary payment is indeed the employer's preparation; it also has a great impact on the general working class. Because prices are stable before salary payment, the declared cost of living index is lowered, and the impressions of all parties are better. In other words, the employer's burden is lighter. Only in this way, employers not only need to transfer funds and sell, but also have this class consciousness playing a role in the background. Thirdly, selling goods one week before salary payment means that one week of interest can be collected. Although the hope of rolling interest on interest is very strong, the hope of 7% or 8% is not without certainty. So why not do it?</p>
<p>Because of these relationships, when looking at short-term trading, you have to see this in the bones. So, yesterday's craziness and the underlying firmness still exist in the short-term twists and turns.</p>
<p>For example, taking the stock market as an example, although the bull companies have not yet ended, the model is very stable. But when you calculate the interest, the meat is not very thick. Salary transfers and the stock market are the most convenient, and the bull market is not very thick. Salary transfers and the stock market are the most convenient. Bull companies looking at the short term and the long term will never look at their own books.</p>
<p>By the way, let me mention gold, banknotes, and silver dollars. Looking at the big picture, there may be new changes in the Central Bank's measures in the gold market. The sharp jump in silver dollars these two days has a lot to do with the business of scraping blood. The lag in US dollars is because the actual sales are not as good as silver dollars, and the flexibility is not as good as silver dollars. This account will not be calculated for the time being. But it is cheaper for the Central Bank. Please pay attention to the changes in the foreign exchange transfer certificate.</p>
<p>Long-Term is Better Than Short-Term; Salary Payment Cycle</p>

<h3>Haiqing Performs Excellently; Shanghai Police Wins by Two Goals</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Jia 1st group of the basketball league is coming to an end. Before the Shanghai Police vs. Haiqing match last night, it was generally expected that the Shanghai Police would be able to handle it easily. However, the result was that Haiqing performed exceptionally well and made very quick shots. The Shanghai Police were still behind by five points in the last five minutes. Haiqing did not use a freeze tactic, so they were fortunate to win 51-47. The score in the first half was 24-21. Haiqing played with the 3rd team of McKinnis last night. Wang Bowen did not participate due to exams. Jia 2D Shandan team won Chengyou 38-28.</p>
<p>In the Jia 1st group Haiqing (McKinnis 3rd team) vs. Shanghai Police, the latter's five players were Wang Rongsheng, He Jingui, Shi Jiuquan, Sun Moses, and Fu Qixia. Haiqing's were Hua Ji, Laimushan, Haikesi, Kaixiong, and Lai Ruohua. Haiqing scored three points in a row at the start, showing a shocking momentum. He Jingui also returned the favor, tying the score at 3-3. Lai Ruohua scored again, and Rongsheng and Jiuquan scored, exceeding 6-5. Laimushan's goal reversed the situation again. From then on, the Shanghai Police attacked continuously, and the foreign generals frequently failed. Moreover, they missed seven consecutive free throws. However, the right wing Hua Ji ran fast and shot accurately, echoing Laimushan on the left and right, which made the Shanghai Police very worried. The Shanghai Police had a slight advantage in the first half 24-21.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Shanghai Police changed Moses for Jiuquan, and Jingui for He Zeng. Under the fierce attack, Haiqing shot extremely quickly, and in a while, they chased the score to 24, 26, and 28, tying the score three times. Jiuquan was changed for Moses again, and Ounas and Hua Ji each scored one goal. The Shanghai Police was shocked by 32-28 and called a timeout. After that, Haiqing still had the upper hand, but the difference was often only one point, and the situation was extremely tense. Hua Ji scored three consecutive goals, reaching 44-39. At that time, there were still five minutes left. Haiqing felt that the victory or defeat was not important to the overall situation, and still wasted frequently, giving the Shanghai Police a chance to take advantage of. Then, He Zeng, Jiuquan, and Yong Biao made free throws and scored, chasing to 45-44, one point short. Jingui replaced Jiuquan again, and Yong Biao scored a basket, exceeding by one point. Hua Ji made two free throws and took the lead again. He Zeng got a free throw opportunity, held his breath and calmly made it, tying the score at 47 each. He Liang took the opportunity to score two more goals, and the Shanghai Police was lucky to win the final victory 51-47.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle; Ends in 2-2 Draw</h3>
<p>The "Local Snake" Zhongyi and the "Mud Dragon" Longtou held a Democratic Cup match in Nanshi yesterday. Because both sides had great ambitions, the competition was very intense. Zhongyi held a 2-0 lead in the first half, but the game ended in a 2-2 draw.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes into the game, Zhang Jiliang passed from the right, and Jiang Kun scored with a header, giving Longtou the first goal. However, five minutes later, Zhongyi's Chen Longquan passed to an open spot, and Yu Zhenyue caught up and scored, tying the game. About ten minutes later, Lu Fangkui scored, also thanks to Chen Longquan's assist, putting Zhongyi ahead 2-1. Afterwards, the game became a stalemate, and the first half ended soon after.</p>
<p>After switching sides, Longtou replaced goalkeeper Gao Weichen with Yan Chengkuan, and Jiang Kun was replaced by Wang Burong. Both teams were eager to win, inevitably leading to some rough play. Fortunately, the referee's strict penalties kept the peace. In the final thirteen minutes of the intense battle, Wang Burong took a corner kick, and his placement was excellent. Zhang Jiliang waited in front of the goal and scored with one touch, tying the game at 2-2. Although there were many highlights afterwards, both defenses were tight, and the score remained unchanged.</p>

<h3>Mini World Games</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lausanne, Switzerland, 7th] The International Olympic Committee will meet in Rome this month to discuss the issue of mini-World Games. They will be held separately in Asia and Central America in 1950, and the Pan American Games will be held in 1951.</p>
<h3>Women's Basketball Tactics</h3>
<p>— Translated by Qi Gong</p>
<p>(A) When the forward moves towards the basket to receive the ball.</p>
<p>(B) The defender passes the ball along the sideline to the forward in the designated area before leaving the area and reaching the mid-line. To avoid passing the ball in the middle of the court, it is more secure to use the defender standing on the sideline to pass the ball.</p>
<p>(C) Increase speed and body rotation, suddenly change pace and turn around. Move forward quickly using body weight, shortening steps, and stopping by slightly bending the knees.</p>
<p>(D) While running, be able to quickly change pace and direction, stop, start, turn around, fake moves, or fake turn around and dart in another direction. These actions must be practiced until proficient. (Note: The above is the art of running and must be practiced diligently to achieve physical agility and versatility.)</p>
<p>C. Rebounding</p>
<p>(1) Rebounding.</p>
<p>(A) When an offensive player shoots, after the ball leaves their hand and heads towards the basket, the defender should immediately prepare to rebound.</p>
<p>(B) When the opponent is taking a free throw, the player positioned on the sideline of the free throw area should immediately step into the key area under the basket after the free thrower releases the ball to rebound. The offensive forward must proceed cautiously, as it is easy to commit a foul by stepping into the key area for more than three seconds. The responsibility for rebounding can be assigned to the free thrower, who can still stand near the free throw line to rebound or receive a pass from a teammate under the basket to shoot again.</p>
<p>(C) If a player is not proficient in rebounding, they must pay attention to the following three methods:</p>
<p>(1) Use fingertips to push the ball to a teammate standing farther from the basket.</p>
<p>(2) Jump high and use both hands to push the ball to the sideline to maintain control.</p>
<p>(3) A forward can jump high and use fingertips to push the ball into the basket.</p>
<p>(D) Players must practice jumping and timing to rebound. This is a required course, but many women's teams do not pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Note: Gaining possession and controlling the ball under the basket can enhance the offense and solidify the defense. Being tall and having long legs naturally provides an advantage. However, if one is not skilled in positioning, height is useless and can even be a disadvantage. When rebounding, do not go too deep under the basket, otherwise the rebounded ball will fly over the head and be missed. If one is too far from the basket, the attacker can take the lead and shoot again. The most important thing is to clearly see the direction the ball is rebounding. The position should be about seven or eight feet from the basket. (To be continued. C)</p>

<h3>Starting from the Teahouse</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Last winter, when a pot of clear tea rose to five yuan in gold yuan notes, I gave up my ten-year habit of going to the teahouse every afternoon because of financial constraints.</p>
<p>In our Changshu, going to the teahouse is simply an indispensable part of life for the upper, middle, and lower classes. Those at the top discuss public affairs, those in the middle chat casually or play chess all day, and those at the bottom negotiate deals. Also, resolving conflicts after an argument (called "drinking tea to talk things out") all happen in teahouses.</p>
<p>The number of teahouses in Changshu is second only to Suzhou. About one or two tenths of them also operate as story-telling venues. However, their nature and structure are all different. Places like "Li Li" and "Huan Cui Small Abode" (the name Huan Cui was given by Yan Gu, the author of *Continued Sea Flowers*, borrowing the name of Old Can's concubine) inside the park face the city and overlook the water, making them very elegant. In the summer, the shade is picturesque, and a cup of clear tea is a pleasure in life. The four teahouses of "Shi Mei" (Zhen Shi Xuan, Wang Shan Xuan, Yi Xin Lu, Xin Mei Ling) all have hundreds of years of history. The poet Yang Wu-yang wrote well in his "Shi Mei Bamboo Branch Verse": "Zhen Shi Wang Shan compete for seats, sandalwood olives and pre-rain tea". The grandeur of those years can still be glimpsed from this. This is the main base for the idle class who live off rent. They have tea morning and evening every day, rain or shine, without fail, more seriously than going to the office. However, last year, no rice rent was collected, and clear tea increased in price every three days, and then every two days. Now it costs 300 gold yuan notes per pot, so the number of tea drinkers is decreasing day by day. The waiters sit idle and sigh, constantly reminiscing about the golden age of the past. The famous "Shi Mei Sesame Cake" is also getting thinner and smaller day by day, and the taste has become bland. From this, it can be reflected that the idle class (or the petty bourgeoisie) is declining day by day.</p>
<p>"De Yi Lou" and "Chang Le" outside the South Gate, however, are still packed with tea drinkers, thanks to the merchants and "quasi-merchants". In order to find out market prices, or buy and sell, "throw their hats" or "carry briefcases", they have to go to the teahouse. They don't care about 300 yuan per pot of clear tea, and they eat a table full of snacks. "Merchants always have a way," people are heard saying everywhere. Reality cannot be resisted. In chaotic times, there is no talk of elegance. The people who "drink tea" are after all more than the people who "savor tea," and later on, there will probably only be people who "guzzle" tea.</p>
<p>The ending of elegance is just poverty, and only those who "guzzle" can understand the true meaning of life. My little essay is a bit nostalgic for the past, and inevitably a bit poor. But this is also inevitable.</p>
<h3>A Cremation Record</h3>
<p>— Yishi</p>
<p>Recently, I attended a friend's cremation ceremony. The ceremony was simple and solemn, and it is worth promoting.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, cremation seems to be more common than in the interior—but it can't be said to be common, just more so. My friend strongly advocated cremation during his lifetime, so after his death and the completion of the funeral rites, he was sent to Jing'an Cemetery. Jing'an Cemetery is the only place in the city with cremation facilities. At the start of the ceremony, the body was placed on an iron frame about the size of a small bed and pushed into the furnace. The furnace is made of fire-resistant bricks, about three or four feet wide and five or six feet high, with a roof and a chimney. The iron frame is pushed in, just like a bread clip for baking bread. After the iron frame is pushed in, the furnace door is closed, and then the gas filling the furnace is ignited, immediately burning fiercely. First the clothes, then the skin, can be seen through a small hole in the furnace door. Afterwards, the manager does not allow family members and friends to stay, so as to avoid seeing it and being unbearable.</p>
<p>At this point, the funeral is over, and family and friends leave. After about two hours, the body has been completely reduced to ashes, which are collected by the funeral home and placed in a marble, metal, or wooden ash box. The box is small, beautiful, and is handed over to the family to collect.</p>
<p>According to the manager, this facility was only available to foreigners and Chinese Christians who had lived in Shanghai for more than three years before the war. When the Japanese occupied Shanghai, it was used by the Japanese. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was taken over by our health authorities, and with vigorous promotion, it is now in a state of being unable to meet the demand.</p>
<p>After attending this cremation ceremony, I deeply believe that this may be the best way to solve funeral problems. It is simple and does not lose its solemnity, achieving the goals of saving effort, money, and time. (All procedures are handled by the funeral home, and the cost is much less than burial.) The ash box can also be purchased in a burial plot or carried around, and it can be worshipped and commemorated. I think it is indeed worth promoting.</p>
<h3>Buying Hope</h3>
<p>— Xianjun</p>
<p>Feng Xuan went to Xue on behalf of Lord Mengchang to collect rent, but instead bought back "righteousness" with the money. Now there are those who buy "hope," which can be compared to ancient and modern times. What is called buying hope? Well, it is the relief lottery issued by the current authorities, which is being snapped up. By spending five hundred gold yuan notes, you can have the hope of winning thirty million gold yuan alone, and you can also gain a reputation for doing good deeds. Therefore, it is no wonder that everyone rushes to it in droves.</p>
<p>I have a friend who told me a funny story. He said that a friend of his was so destitute that he only had a few pawn tickets and a relief lottery ticket that someone had given him in his pocket. He wanted to commit suicide several times, but in the end, because of the hope of winning thirty million yuan alone, he did not have the courage to commit suicide.</p>
<p>I said that judging from the various measures taken by the authorities in recent years, issuing relief lotteries can also be regarded as one of the good policies—because it saved someone's life and prevented him from committing suicide immediately.</p>
<h3>Crumbs of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wei</p>
<p>During the recent war, scientists invented a piece of paper that could predict poison gas. It could be inserted into the tip of a gun, and when there was poison gas in the air, the paper would change color due to chemical action.</p>
<p>The number of electrons passing through a sixteen-candlepower carbon filament light bulb in one second would take three million people 16,700 years to count.</p>
<p>The famous psychologist Kuroda Ryo has studied the frequency of dreams in men and women. According to him, men dream an average of 2.7 times in ten days, and women 3.5 times.</p>
<h3>American Comic Books</h3>
<p>— Suo Yu</p>
<p>In the big cities of our country, comic books have become a common "children's reading material"; but in general poor rural areas, they are still not easy to see. But in the United States, the situation is different. American comic books are truly a miracle in the publishing industry, with an average monthly circulation of 60 million copies.</p>
<p>The content of American comic books is of course different from that of our country. They replace sword light magic treasures with rockets and death ray guns, and barbarians and beasts with demons and monsters. The content is mostly filled with murder and crazy lies, which are of course harmful and useless to children.</p>
<p>The American education community is unanimously opposed to these comic books. They have collected many criminal cases caused by comic books. A seventeen-year-old deliberately stabbed a thirteen-year-old companion, saying, "I don't read a lot of comic books—I only read about ten a week. I like to read comic books about crime, where they often stab girls to death with knives." Another seventeen-year-old youth killed someone and left a note with the words "Devil" signed on it. Three sixteen-year-olds jointly killed a fourteen-year-old boy "for revenge". A fourteen-year-old boy shot and killed a policeman. A thirteen-year-old boy took a handgun to a store to rob money. Another twelve-year-old child killed his sister; and a thirteen-year-old boy murdered his companion and was sentenced to twenty-two years in prison. According to their own accounts, the protagonists of these shocking crimes all liked to read comic books.</p>
<p>In schools, comic books have caused shocking violence. A sixteen-year-old child was beaten all over his body with a broken glass bottle by his classmates. There were six places near his eyes that needed to be stitched up. In a primary school, older students often abused and intimidated younger ones, robbing them of their money, watches, and fountain pens. When teachers asked them who had stolen their things, they refused to say, for fear of "having their eyes gouged out." In a civilian school, two police officers regularly patrol to prevent various acts of violence. The mathematics teacher at a certain school must ask a police officer to help him "proctor" during exams.</p>
<p>In the United States, only 25 percent of parents do not object to comic books; the remaining 75 percent strongly advocate banning them. They all believe that comic books not only deprive children of the opportunity to read good books, but also chronically poison children's minds. Children themselves have noticed this. At a primary school in Chicago, students took the initiative to burn all their comic books and went to nearby bookstores and stationery stores to tell the owners that they would never buy comic books again. Recently, several other schools have also launched this "refusal to read" movement.</p>
<h3>Weekend Entertainment</h3>
<p>— Yu Wangwo</p>
<h3>In the Restaurant</h3>
<p>— Ruoxu</p>
<p>This is a true story that I witnessed.</p>
<p>I work in a small company. Because the office is too far from home, I always eat lunch at a nearby restaurant. That restaurant, neither big nor small, has all kinds of food, both good and bad; therefore, people from all walks of life patronize it; although it cannot be said to be bustling, it is still quite prosperous. Among these people from all walks of life, there is one who has attracted my great attention. This gentleman, wearing a long gown and a felt hat, carrying a briefcase, and wearing a circular badge on his chest, walks steadily and carries a bit of literary air, undoubtedly a low-level civil servant in some agency.</p>
<p>About less than half a year ago, I first saw him step into this restaurant and happened to sit opposite me. He ordered a set meal, added some side dishes, and poured some wine. He sipped and ate, leisurely looking out the door, truly enjoying himself. Of course, I am a poor guy and can only eat things like salted broad beans and soy sauce radish. Seeing such a lavish customer, I couldn't help but feel respectful, and on the other hand, I was a little envious. But unfortunately, I lacked the money, so I could only swallow my saliva, greedily look at his lavish dishes, chew the soy sauce radish hard, and swallow the rice in big mouthfuls, even hurting my tongue. So I blamed everything on that lavish customer. I finished my meal quickly, gave him an angry glance, and then paid the bill and went out with resentment.</p>
<p>Strangely, he seemed to be intentionally trying to annoy me. He often arrived at the same time as me, neither early nor late, and sat nearby. So the above routine became my homework: every day I glared at him, paid the bill, and went out with an injured tongue.</p>
<p>But a month ago, the lavish customer in my mind gradually changed. He no longer seemed lavish. His dishes changed from lavish to inferior, and then from inferior to barely adding any dishes. Then his set meal also went down from high-end to mid-range, and then to economy. He no longer looked leisurely out the door. Every day, he hurried in, hunched over the table, finished his few mouthfuls of red rice, and hurried out again. Occasionally, he looked up at me, his eyes seeming to carry some embarrassment, and quickly bowed his head to eat. Although, at this time, what he ate was still better than what I ate, I still couldn't even qualify for the set meal club.</p>
<p>But a week ago, he finally fell from this club as well. He started not eating set meals, but instead eating six steamed buns, and then gradually changed from six to four. He no longer looked at me at all, and just hurried in and hurried out every day...</p>
<p>One day, perhaps the kind-hearted waiter had noticed his declining state, or perhaps he even pitied him, and said to him kindly:</p>
<p>"Old customer, I think you should switch to plain rice. Four steamed buns cost more than a thousand, and it's not as filling as plain rice. Rice only costs eight hundred, and it comes with a side dish."</p>
<p>I put down my chopsticks and looked up at that lavish customer—he wasn't lavish anymore. His lips trembled, wanting to say something, his face turned red, a look of embarrassment. But then he didn't say anything, a bitter smile flashed across his face. He lowered his head and said softly, "Thank you, just get me a plain rice meal." So his rice was served; two bowls of red rice, a plate of soy sauce radish, exactly the same as mine, the worst kind. I looked at the three slices of soy sauce radish placed in front of each of us and smiled subconsciously.</p>
<p>After that day, I went to eat lunch as usual. But this time, I felt a noticeable difference. The lavish customer across from me was gone. He didn't come anymore. Did the waiter hurt his self-esteem? Or did he not even have the money for plain rice anymore?</p>
<p>In the corner, an old gramophone was playing an old and faded song record: "When Will You Return?" I couldn't help but feel sorry for that declining low-level civil servant, even though he had repeatedly made my tongue hurt from chewing. So I chewed the soy sauce radish more furiously.</p>
<h3>"Adding Fuel to the Fire"</h3>
<p>— Suobei</p>
<p>After carefully analyzing the character "談" (talk), I deeply feel that it is not good. Because our Mr. Cangjie, when he created this character, put "fire on top of fire" to the right of the character "言" (speech).</p>
<p>Is it that Mr. Cangjie, like Liu Bowen, had considerable foresight?</p>
