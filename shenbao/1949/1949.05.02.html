<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬警備司令部發言人張泰祥，一日下午三時於招待記者會上分析最近軍事態勢，之處共軍於渡江以後，軍事進攻難似迅速，然已伏下一大危機，卽其補給綫隨時有被截斷之處，如遇挫折，其敗亦將如江河之一萬千里。張氏謂：軍事之勝敗，非決於一城一地之得失，而在於消滅對方之主力。國軍現爭取主動地位，主力仍然保持，作戰猶如賭博，「等」，「忍」，「狠」，爲其　訣。國軍之「等」「忍」截斷卽將過去，此後司機作「狠」之表現。就上海而論，張氏申訴若幹人希望共軍不來攻或共軍來攻時國軍不予抵抗，以免遭受損失，均屬可笑。共軍之口號中有「清算上海」之句，故其對上海必不可放鬆。而國軍在滬，則有竄死必守之決心，如共軍來攻，卽國軍發「狠」之時。張氏強調目前爲自由民主對暴力恐怖之戰爭，故相信自由民主必獲最後勝利。</p>

<p>〔聯合社舊金山卅日電〕北平新華電台卅日廣播人民解放軍司令部發言人之生命，要求英美法三國迅速由中國撤退軍隊，兵艦及軍用飛機，同時允許保護在華外僑從事正當職業，並願考慮與各國樹立外交關係，惟首先各國政府必須與國民政府斷絕關係。該項聲明大部份係直斥邱吉爾主張英國加派軍艦至中國海面，並駁斥艾德禮關於長江砲轟英軍艦事件之聲明。據該聲明稱，英艦砲火使共軍傷亡二百五十二人，英人在中國領土犯此巨大罪行，人民解放軍自可要求英政府承認其錯誤，道歉賠償。該項聲明於駁斥艾德禮之一部份聲明後續稱，人民解放軍在渡江或其他行動方面並不希望任何國家與以援助。相反的，人民解放軍要求英美法三國迅速自中國海陸空撤退其在長江黃浦江及中國其他地點之武裝軍隊，兵艦，軍用飛機及海軍陸戰隊，勿再援助中國人民之敵，從事內戰。直至目前爲止，中國人民革命軍事委員會及人民政府，尚未與任何外國政府樹立外交關係。中國人民革命軍事委員會及人民政府，願保護在華從事正當職業之一切外僑，並願考慮與各國樹立外交關係。惟此項關係之樹立，應基於平等，互惠及相互　熏彼此之獨立與領土權完整。第一各國不應援助國民黨反動派。中國人民革命軍事委員會及人民政府不願受任何國政府威嚇性之任何行動。各國政府如願考慮與中共政府樹立外交關係，則必須與國民黨殘餘勢力斷絕關係，並自中國撤退武裝軍隊。艾德禮稱，因中共過去並未與各國樹立外交關係，遂不願與外國政府之爾外交人員發生關係。此種說法毫無根據。美英及加拿大三國政府，過去曾協助國民黨反對共產黨，艾德禮殆忘之乎，贍送新近被炸沉之重巡洋艦重慶號者果爲何國，英國以巡洋艦贍國民黨政府，國民黨政府之飛機乃於駭　投效中共時將其炸沉·</p>
<h3>美國務院與使館　仍保持聯絡</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓卅日電〕國務院發書人麥克德模卅日稱，渠不知悉任何情事，足以支持司徒大使在南京被共軍軟　之謠傳。渠稱「各大時光人員皆寫彼等自身之安全而留居於使館內。共黨在吾人之使館外，斷續地派有衛士駐守。此等衛士撤退而又恢復者數次。司徒大使笨人雖未離使館，大使館職員三人卅日曾外出使館，而未受任何麻煩」。麥克德模表示，國務院仍與大使館保持聯絡，並未提及司使成使館任何職員被捕之事。</p>

<h3>西康之謎</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　周學端</p>
<p>紛爭，劉文輝坐困雅安，一籌莫展。西康漢夷難處，民情倔寶，蘊藏寓僥，資源無盡，是我國最有前途的天然寶庫，康局治亂，舉國矚目，在這裏，記者特地對康變內幕，作一客觀報導。</p>
<p>雅變真象　械鬥抗剷</p>
<p>西康變亂，蔓延雅甯兩屬，雅屬包括榮經·天全·廬山一帶，起因是械鬥與「抗剷」，甯亂是鄧（德亮）孫（仿）衝突，雅屬械鬥，又榮經與天全，「榮經事件」由該縣參會議長田偉，副議長陳伯昌兩旅，糞質不勻，權利衝突，雙方助員數萬爪牙，展開激烈戰鬥。「天全事件」是該地荀·周·舒·貢·四巨族，因爭奪地方權利進行大規模械鬥。兩大械鬥擴大，引起地方混亂，天榮一帶，半年來均在恐怖狀態。「抗剷」原因最複雜，規模最龐大，醞釀已數月，現有自稱「人民自衛軍」三萬餘人，由川康邊境袍哥·土匪及部份「懇社」人員組成。首領卽上次「雅屬事變」的李元寧·李現春·朱世正·陳志武·高榮聯等，聲勢浩大。劉文輝特由蓉趕返雅安坐鎮，叛軍由天全·蔗山·榮經三路進兵合團，戰事一度蔓延至雅安城南飛仙關，這是今日西康的心腹之患，戰亂迄今仍在持續。</p>
<p>變亂擴大　原因複雜</p>
<p>提起雅屬事件來由，源遠流長，從卅五年第一次雅變到今天，康境暗流醞釀，未嘗一日安定，癥結所至，　爲［抗剷］。本來鴉片烟在西康地瘠民貧，生產不足，劉文輝主康十餘年，過去軍　財賦，全無所出，純恃［公烟］彌補。狡黠之徒，利用作奸犯科，非法牟利，山區邊民，更以種烟糧食，向外換取各種物資，因而西康烟毒遍地，談到禁烟，真是根深蒂固，積重難返。同時雅屬實權全部掌握在劉文輝侄子劉元琮手裏，劉是有名的［三將軍］稟性粗鄙，貪婪無厭，軍隊專門包庇種運，與地方豪劣，爭權奪利，積不相能，上次雅屬事變，卽因此釀成打亂。變亂平息，在雅安舉行［善後檢討會］，地方人士卽要求劉文輝確有禁烟決心，但第一是包庇種運，都是強有力的實力份子，第二是執行禁令，難免濟私舞弊，於是由［抗剷］而發生［變亂］，當局不能用政治方式疏導，才變成今天帶有政治意味的［雅亂］。</p>
<p>甯屬變亂　鄧孫衝突</p>
<p>甯屬事變，卽靖邊司令鄧（德亮）孫（仿）之爭，這是一幕濃厚封建意識的邊去傳奇。鄧是前［康南王］鄧秀廷長子，孫是鄧秀廷老部屬；鄧秀廷是甯屬夷族怪傑，因為歷來傾向政府，頭腦清楚，思想進步，在夷族中具有絕大權威，政府在邊疆辦理夷務，無不借重他的力量［以夷治夷］。劉文華治康，委他做靖邊司令，張騫倫任西昌行轅主任，特與結爲兒女親家，部下擁有四五千年精銳夷兵。鄧秀廷死後，勢力劃分兩派，一派擁邊副司令孫仿爲首，一派擁戴鄧德亮繼位，實際力量操在鄧老太太手中。當時政府念鄧秀廷廿年安邊勞煩，部隊全部保留，交孫仿全權指揮，另由西昌警備司令賀國光保送鄧德亮到中央受訓，鄧母卽請委渠子繼鄧秀廷職，未獲允准。鄧華業返康，中央卽派爲靖邊副司令兼靖邊團長，但鄧母再堅決請求鄧應司令並全權統率部眾，中央爲維持威信，再度不准，並由西昌警備部迎孫來昌就任，鄧則拒受新命，於是雙方遂發生權利衝突。</p>
<p>樂西公路　血戰兼旬</p>
<p>鄧孫衝突裏面化，康省當局及地方人士，爲消弭兵機，奔走調解，但無效果。鄧德亮卽自行成立司令部，委派團長人員，另大隊長等若干，並調重兵集瀘沽，以小廟，禮州，義晨，松林爲防綫，鄧則在瀘沽自行就職，發佈文告，事態愈趨擴大。賀國光爲此特自渝返昌，召集甯屬各方首要舉行擴大會議，商討解決辦法，會中一致主張，爲維持地方秩序，維護國家紀綱，應以和平寬大爲息爭原則。中間又經賀國光張騫倫以公誼私情，派代表向雙方疏導勸解始終以利害懸殊，未獲協議，遂展開兵戎相見。鄧德亮所部，動員靖邊團三團，外漢軍鄧宇凱·鄧宇俊·鄧宇華·羅克清四部，人槍一千五百餘，夷兵長甲五角，羅木呷·竹　支等十餘部落，合共任槍五六千·孫仿所部，動員靖邊部五個大隊，夷兵那支打魚等十餘部，人數與鄧部相當，雙方沿樂西公路，血戰兼旬，迄今戰事仍在繼續演進。</p>
<p>西康－神秘西部，要解決這精神之區的神秘問題，在烽火遍天的今天，是難來求其澈底澄清的。</p>

<h3>社論　談疏散人口</h3>
<p>自從和談決裂，共軍陸續渡江，國軍撤離京·鎮·錫·蘇以後，上海一般市民即直覺到戰火已迫於眉睫；於是人心浮動，街頭巷尾，充滿了戰時景色，社會秩序，金融經濟，亦隨之波動而陷於混亂。這種現象，不但直接妨碍地方治安，而且影響人心。因此，我們覺得本市軍政府局最近的疏散人口與安定社會，是需要本市全體市民密切合作的一件緊急措施。</p>
<p>本市軍政當局自上月底起，即決定澈底疏散本市人口，規定外埠人口限制入境，本市無國民身份證的市民強行疏散，並隨時隨地舉行突擊檢查，且規定儘量利用水陸交通工具，嚴禁裝運傢具，便利市民疏散。按本市人口密度，近三年來，一直向着飽和點直綫上昇，據去年十　月全市戶口總清查結果，本市人口總數爲五·四四八·四六六人，失業人數常佔百分之三十以上，難民亦常有二三十萬人，經常需要救濟。最近四個月來，蘇北沿江各縣，以及京滬，滬杭沿線難民，紛紛湧入本市，人口激增，早已超過六百萬以上。而救濟工作又難開展，因此疏散人口，實爲迫切之需。</p>
<p>不過說到疏散人口，一副驚心怵目的流亡圖，便懸現在我們眼前，老弱轉乎溝壑，壯者流離四方，許多馴良的人民，難免都陷入於妻離子散，家破人亡的慘境。所謂「天地不仁，以萬物為蒭狗」。以往戰爭中流亡的經騐告訴我們疏散工作中最重要的是交通工具的調配，交通秩序的維持，在在必須有通盤計劃，而船票車票不但要根本撲滅黑市，並且應另訂優待辦法，便利市民購票。但恰當上海市人口清查疏散聯合執行處成立，疏散人口告市民書發表之日，火車飛機票價一律改以銀元計價，這無疑的是加給疏散人口以一種有力的阻撓。我們曉得本市經濟基礎雄厚的市民。早則在三數月前，遲則也在上星期內，已袁飛港·穗·台灣，今日被迫疏散的人，大都是無力逃難的升鬥細民，不然也就是外埠剛到上海，腳跟還沒有立定的難民，又有什麽門路去洽購機船車票？疏散出境又將如何生活？這些都是英明的軍政當局應該爲老百姓考慮的。</p>
<p>記得抗日期間，桂林失守前夕，緊急疏散，由柳州而宜山，河池，難民絡繹於途，毫無怨艾；中央更能及時派遣大員趕往都勻，獨山，金城江　帶施放急振，擔救難民，並招待文化界人士前往貴陽轉赴陪都。當時湯總司令部隊適逢命調往黔省前綫應援；而最近在滬就任警總政務委員之一的谷正綱，當日就曾以社會部長身份親臨前綫，出入槍林彈雨間招撫宜慰。很巧的，今日湯谷　氏都在本市，担任着保衛大上海的軍政任務，疏散人口工作在他們和市政當局支持之下·我們相信一定會駕輕車就熟路，頭頭是道。一定會護苦難中的老百姓災離難，難離身，一切災殃都可以化險為夷。但我們仍願提出幾點意見，以供當局參考。</p>
<p>第一，交通工具要儘量徵發應用，集中供應調配，加開疏散列車，調派疏散專輪，特別優待出境市民。先行取締銀元計價辦法，最好辦到大批免費輸送。</p>
<p>第二，旅途生活要設法維持，旅途安全要竭力保障。尤其船舶車輛之檢騐須嚴格執行。江亞太平失事慘劇的血淚猶在眼前，覆車等情亦時有所聞，流離失所的難民身世已夠淒涼，斷不能再遭遇到意外的驚險了。</p>
<p>第三，出境人口要統籌安頓，當局亟應指定疏散地區，商同該地首長暨地方人士妥善安頓入境人口。不要送出上海市就不管，讓他們去流落天涯；或者以鄰為壑，反而增加了那一地方的難民。</p>
<p>要之，在現行危迫的環境下，疏散人口固爲當務之急；但上海市民屢經戰亂，飽嘗痛苦，現在又到了戰火燒到門口的前夕，心情的沉重與慘痛，是不言可知的，軍政當局自應特別予以憫憐，千萬不可因疏散人口，再加深市民的痛苦！</p>
<h3>傑塞普向艾契逊报告　與蘇聯談判結果　下次會議英法均將參加</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約卅日電〕消息靈通人士近日稱，美代表傑賽普與聯外次馬利克本尾期兩度晤談，討論解除柏林封鎖條件，已獲進步，談判範圍卽將擴大，加入英代表賈徳幹與發代表夏凡爾。此種談判事實上將爲四國外長會議之初步。代表並將佈置四外長會議之程序與日期，蘇聯與英法似已同意外長會議應於五月下旬在巴黎開會，討論的過問題，日內不致有何新發展。賽普已赴華盛頓，向國務部長艾契遜當面報告與蘇聯代表談話結果。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎卅日電〕此間可靠方面謂，柏林封鎖解除後，四強會議可於五月十五日召開。法外交部接獲其駐聯合國代表旭凡爾之電話報告后，確信由柏林封鎖之解除不過數內之事。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林卅日電〕接近素軍政府之人士透露，蘇情報處長杜巴諾夫今日預示，　績已有十間月之柏林封鎖，將於七十二小時內解除。惟英軍方發言人則表示尚不知此事。局杜巴諾夫於今日下午告蘇區報紙主筆稱：與柏林西德間交通限制有關之主要問題，已由四強解決，解除封鎖的工作，可望在今後三天內開始，而外長會議不久亦可召開。</p>
<p>〔路透社社倫敦一日電〕倫敦官方對柏林所傳柏林封鎖不日卽可解除之說，持保留態度。此間相信西德英美法三軍事總督，於接獲關於美蘇間洽談柏林問題之報告後，尚在等待三國政府之新訓令。關於撤除封鎖的技術問題，尚待紐約或柏林繼續磋商。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約卅日電〕聯合國大會主席卽澳外長伊伐特今日發表談話，預料柏林封鎖可早日解除。據稱：現有種種理由相信柏林爭執可以結束，封鎖可及早解除。此事之解決，實爲聯合國機構所大快，因國際和平與正義，由此推進一步。柏林問題之解決，並非大國整個爭執解決之謂，但其他各項問題，已獲新接觸之端倪。不僅德國問題如此，遠東問題亦然。</p>
<h3>西德部署恢復博林陸運　正等待蘇方行動　蘇開放英區航運態度較前溫和</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林三十日電〕西德今夜已佈置恢復柏林陸運之最後計劃，希望莫斯科於五一勞動節發表解除柏林封鎖命令。據漢堡消息，西德鐵路準備一日內向柏林開出火車三十列，其中並有煤車二十列。</p>
<p>柏林蘇軍當局昨日以溫和態度答應英方兩項要求后，此間樂觀氣氛濃厚，認為蘇聯態度似已澈底轉變。蘇方允許不再干涉柏林英軍區之運河交通，並對英方憲兵三名在英蘇交界區被人民警察逮捕事，表示歉意。</p>
<p>〔合眾社柏林三十日電〕蘇·英雙方三十日同意在柏林西區運河內完全自由通航，此係蘇聯在去年六月開始封鎖柏林以後，東西國家間的第一次重要協議，蘇方運輸主任克拉許甯少將及英國駐德佔領軍柏林副司令貝森，在會議中同意向蘇·英雙方登記的船舶，均得在西區運河內自由航行該項談判係由克拉許甯發起，在蘇聯佔領軍總部舉行。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林三十日電〕昨在英區孟美機場被蘇方逮捕的英憲兵三名，經英方抗議後已於今日釋放。三憲兵係奉令前往調查蘇區警察侵入英區晨場强徵牲口之事件，蘇方以爲彼等已誤入蘇界。然據英發言人稱，彼等並未踏入蘇區界綫以內。</p>
<h3>杜立德主張　避免對蘇作戰　否則應及時投擲原子彈</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓一日電〕七年前第一次領導空襲東京的退伍空軍中將杜立德一日在此間喬治頓稱：美國必須從事避免對蘇作戰的努力，但如果侵略的跡象出現，則必須準備在第一個侵略跡象出現之時，投擲原子彈。渠稱：在最近的將來，如果美國保持強大，則對蘇戰爭可以避免，但永久的和平，則需要美國的軍事力量，國內及國外的教育及世界精神的復活，配合一起，始能達成</p>
<h3>英歡迎希士　參加歐洲會議</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦卅日電〕消息靈通人士稱：英國將歡迎希臘及土耳其參加歐洲會議。按此事將於五月三日在此間召開之會議尚將對各國代表在此間擬成之歐洲議會地位之草案，加以最後修正。</p>
<h3>荷控制印尼　僅城市與道路　白尼委會提出報告</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖三十日〕聯合國印尼委員會今日發表關於印尼軍事局勢之報告，其結論指出，在前印尼共和國所管轄的大部份區域內，荷軍祗控制將主要城市及道路，在東西爪哇一九四八年十二月十五日以前，卽爲荷軍控制的區域內，亦有印尼共和國軍之集中。爪哇蘇門答臘各地衝突時起，在過去兩個月中，衝突雖然多，但多爲小規模者，每次每方不過二百人左右，僅於共和軍進攻日惹之一次，印尼方面曾出動一千五百人。在印尼活動者除共和國正規軍外，尚有各種遊擊部隊。聯合國委員會認為除非獲得政治上通盤的解決，經濟難以復與，秩序難以恢復，人民的痛苦亦不能解除。</p>
<h3>解決荷印紛爭　美提新方案　主張印尼參加海牙會議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞三十日電〕荷蘭與印尼共和國領袖今日研究解決印荷爭執之新解決方案，該案係聯合國調解團美國代表柯樞蘭非正式提出，主張印尼共和國在日惹恢復前，印尼代表團主席羅姆應由其他共和國領袖授權聲明：（一）贊成停戰令；（二）堅主印尼政府應參加海牙圓桌會議。</p>
<h3>匈保虐待教士案　交有聯國家制止　聯合國大會通過決議</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社富勒興卅日電〕聯合國大會今夜通過特別政治委員會討論阴真諦主教及保國教士案之決議，規定邀請各個與匈保兩國簽訂和約之國家，按照和約中規定，共同採取行動，以制止兩國之破壞民主自由。贊成此議案者共三十四國，反對爲六個斯拉夫國家，壞權者有阿富汗，緬甸，印度，伊朗，巴基斯坦，沙特阿拉伯，敘利亞，委內瑞拉，及葉門九國。大會已決定將兩案至於下次會議之議程中。</p>
<h3>謀刺伊王嫌疑犯　二人判死刑　被捕三百人二百人已開釋</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社德黑蘭卅日電〕此問官方公佈稱：被控參加謀刺伊王之九人，今日已有二人被判死刑，且謂，其餘各人，皆被處半年監禁至無期徒刑不等。伊總理產依德今日在國會中謂，伊王遇刺後被捕之嫌疑三百人中，已有二百人開釋。</p>
<h3>美不擬邀請西班牙　參加大西洋公約　參院外委會下星期可予通過</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三十日電〕參議院外交委員會主席康納利今日稱，本會辯論北大西洋安全條約，將於下星期結束，屆時將一直予以通過。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓卅日電〕此間觀察家指稱：西班牙目前尚無加入大西洋公約之可能，因西班牙之參加，難望得美國參議院三分之二議員之贊成。杜魯門總統認為任何新條約須經參院三分之二議員通過始能成立，西班牙之加入大西洋公約，亦應通過此一手續。國務卿艾契遜在參院外交委員會中答范登堡之詢問時稱：渠奉總統之命聲明，任何新國參加大西洋公約，實際上卽等於美國與該國簽訂新約，因此根據憲法，總統希望在渠個人表示同意前，先請求參院之批准。被詢及何以葡萄牙得加入大西洋公約時，艾氏答曰，此乃該約簽字國之意見，邀葡參加爲各發起國一致的決議，彼等並未決定邀西班牙參加。據悉參眾兩院不乏主張邀西班牙加入大西洋公約之議員在，天主教人士對此事主張尤力。</p>
<h3>加下院批准　大西洋公約</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社滬太瓦卅日電〕加拿大下院今日以一百八十五票對零票一致批准大西洋公約，在表决前之簡短辯論中，加總理表示，希望同樣贊之公約，短期內能予簽字，包括蘇聯及在舊金山會議簽署聯合國憲軍之各國在內。</p>
<h3>華萊士抨擊　大西洋公約　要求美蘇計劃和平</h3>
<p>〔合眾社克利夫蘭一日電〕華萊士三十日晚指斥「范登堡冷戰」及「杜魯門主義」。並稱：他們支持的大西洋公約必敗。華萊士在此間音樂院中對聽眾稱：「和平之道，絕非大西洋公約」。渠稱，「大西洋公約將使歐洲淪為中國第二」。渠要求美蘇兩國建造真正強有力的聯合國，俾雙方能在恢復良知以後，開始計劃和平，而非戰爭。此爲華萊士進行要求拒絕大西洋公約的全國性旅行中的第三次主要演說。</p>
<h3>士不欲參加　大西洋公約　成立地中海公約暫不可能</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社安加拉卅日電〕土耳其總理古邦爾丹今日招待記者，發表該國外交政策之聲明稱：「土耳其從未亟欲參加大西洋公約，余認為目下成立地中海公約，猶不可能。若不參加足以加重吾人負担之公約，則於吾人之地位，反爲有利。」</p>
<h3>菲農民軍否認　暗殺奎松夫人</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺三十日電〕農民軍共產黨首領泰魯克，今日否認其部下曾計劃製殺奎松夫人。泰氏由其呂宋島秘密總部向馬尼刺各報發表聲明稱，吾人從未發出加害奎松夫人或其家屬之任何命令。現正從事調查，如發見有疏忽或破壞農民軍紀律之事，犯者將予嚴懲。同時政府軍仍在呂宋中部，繼續向主使此次慘案之農民軍司令維納斯進攻。</p>
<h3>緬政府委員向總統建議　暫展緩舉行普選　政府軍將在上緬甸開始總攻</h3>
<p>〔聯合社仰光卅日電〕權威方面今日消息，緬甸政府七八委員會，因內戰引起全國紛擾，已向總統建議展期舉行普選。按照緬甸憲法，總選舉應獨立後十八個月內卽本年七月四日左右舉行。另據政府公報發表，卽將在上緬甸對軍開始總共。政府軍自瓦城西南八十哩之梅蒂拉長驅而下，已佔領中緬甸西塘江加倫軍司令部所在地之東戈。其它距仰光一百五十哩，政府軍進怗時，城中幾已逃避一空。大部份加倫族人聞已往大古區參加對仰光之攻勢，到後路空處，爲政府軍所乘。</p>

<h3>火樹銀花說倫敦</h3>
<p>— 穎之</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦航訊〕在北大西洋盟約簽訂的前夕，黯淡了快十年的倫敦，重又大放光明，讓各色的火炬來點繼遺夜的倫敦，雖然，「花市燈如舊」其他的情況卻完全不同了。這原來舉世矚目的國際政治首都，已從唐甯街遷移到白宮。這原來操縱齊世界財富的經濟樞鈕，已經從倫敦的BANK區搬到了紐約的華爾街。昔日氣象萬千的英格蘭銀行，正像是一個賭急了的落魄王孫，腆顏地向他舊日的「伙計」借貸。</p>
<p>工黨爲了競選卽將來臨，要保持政權，就非取歡與它的選民不可。於是在二月下旬倫敦西南HAMMER　SMITH區選的前一天，就宣佈衣着不再配給。主婦們在購得大量桌布茶巾之餘，自然歡水思源，去投工黨的票，結果是工黨以一千六百十三票的多數取得勝利。接着是雞蛋不再配給（雖然筆者每星期還是只吃到不大不小的雞蛋三個，沒有多拿到一個額外的「混」蛋），牛奶可以自由購飲，糖果供應不再限制（但是肉類卻減少到一星期祗吃一次炒肉絲——英國的一本雜誌把肉類的減少歸咎於阿根廷的獨裁者貝隆夫人，該文說阿根廷總統的太太貝隆夫人，是該國的MADAME　POMADOVR。她去年訪英時，因爲白金漢宮沒有接她進宮參加華宴，於是她一怒而停止供給英國肉食）。一切令人感到二次大戰已經慢慢變成歷史上的陳跡，戰爭的創痛漸漸籠罩到人們的心頭。這以血和淚換來的光明，又能維持到多久？</p>
<p>筆者住在倫敦的北郊，昨晚急於要寄一封在捷克度假的友人一信，就乘地道車進城去投郵，順便在倫敦有了的中心洗去觀光一下這新的倫敦之光。在LEICESTER　SQUARE比之鱗次都是首輪的影院，門外都閃閃的在發光，誠然在五色的霓虹燈下阻街的女郎　得比前煥發得多。——明眸皓睞　是年輕了一些。再往前走就是著名的PICCADILY　　IRCUS。嘿！看夜景的人們擠得滿坑滿谷。有的還是扶老攜幼站在街頭對這闊別了的燈光瞪大了眼睛出神。年老的也許在回憶着過去大英帝國的　榮。年小的根本生於憂患出生以來沒有見過這些「城開不夜」的奇景。最令人矚目的是保維爾牛肉汁的廣告，設計成一個花筒，一陣「燄火」散放出無數五色的「火星」。再順熏親王道前進，許多櫥窗內都在發光，最考究的百貨店AUSTIN　REDE沒有裝霓虹燈卻把整個大廈洗浴在淡黃的燈光中。還有福特汽車公司的櫥窗，全用天藍的燈光在照射那些發亮的汽車（英國的汽車也從最保守的式樣改成流綫型了。據證目的迎合美國人的喜愛——一切都唯美國馬首是瞻，因爲他們有的是金元。英國所需要的是金元！）再向左轉　，便是牛津道，所有店鋪買的是女人的時裝。新奇的帽子，各色的手套還有NEW　LOOK的春裝，晚服。但是這些店家老闆們鈎心鬥角所要招徠顧客的卻是一些大腹賈，只有他們才能不經意的買上一輛汽車，上AUSTIN　REED去裝扮自己成一個典型的紳士，只有那些貴婦名媛才能夠上定製那些新春晚裝，歐義小　要她們的「紳士」去買一　新大衣或是一串珠項練！</p>
<h3>動盪閩局</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　濮得玠</p>
<p>萑苻遍地</p>
<p>〔本報福州廿八日杭州訊〕「治安」問題，在福建和在任何其他後方的省份一樣，是最棘手的問題。福州綏署主任兼主席朱紹良將軍到任後，首先就下決心整理治安工作，他而且承認：「這半年來，本省治安情形，因爲外來的影響繼續擴大，致使各地發生許多的紛擾。」這許多的紛擾表現為今日萑苻遍地的現象，閩局便由是愈動　。</p>
<p>匪，或者是「土共」，活躍在全省各地，從北河浙江交界的福鼎，西和江西交界的長江，南和廣東交界的永定，到內地的沙縣，永安，沿海的黃田，福清，甚至於就在省會福州週邊的林森縣，都時有耳聞。警保當局爲之忙疲不已，地方自衛國家隊則更是防不勝防。半年來省政的不上軌道，使這治安問題成了當今急務。零星小股撑了壯大的武力，草寇海賊竟多染上了政治色彩，這一問題驟然已不簡單。</p>
<p>閩粵邊區的劉永生股自然是最值得注意的，從喻英奇被任爲閩粵邊區剿匪總指揮這一措施來看，是不需要任何解說。劉股的主力大部在廣東省經活動，福建境內也有閩南，閩西兩個支隊，經當　　詔安·製背·本和·南靖·澄浦·永定·上杭·龍岩等縣的鄉鎮聞，劫憲械彈倉殺，伏擊隊　。局官方報告，閩南支隊李仲先部人搶共五百餘，閩西支隊江河沿部人搶二百餘，但去年清剿的戰果是：斃匪三八三名，傷匪三一九名，俘匪三〇六名，自新匪二五八名，繳獲長短槍四五〇支，手提機槍一挺；保安團的損失是陣亡兵十八名，負傷官一員兵二十二名，輕機槍二挺，步槍十餘支，而且是「現仍在搜剿中」。似乎這股匪是越剿越多，在本年二月二十二日永定縣的坎市還被劉股一部人搶三百餘眾攻入，刧去賦　七萬餘斤，散發貧民；直到最近四月八日另一部人搶七百餘又擾上杭縣的崟市，經保安團隊圍剿，不支逃粵。這股匪應該被稱為「土共」，因爲據官方報告，他們的繼製裏有政委，也有婦女隊，民聯團等等。</p>
<p>在閩北據傳有偏「閩浙贛邊區人民遊擊從隊」的目的，但其實上，股匪的活動是散漫的。東北隅福縣，霞浦等縣時常受浙南鄭州丹甫股匪的竄擾，三月底，甯德縣霍童鎮遭受攻掠，福建縣城且一度幾乎淪陷。政和縣和浙江境的慶元縣邊境，則是陳牯老股匪的淵藪。至於建甌，南平古田，是左體美股的天下，明溪·將樂·泰甯邊境，却有羅江波·陳香生股匪高唱「擁漿產黨」口號而殺人放火。這些股匪少者六七十，多者兩三百，並不　有政治意識，所以多做些　路越貨的勾當：一月間，南平金甌段公路橋樑被焚燒，爲了「匪氛仍　」，至今不會全部修復。三月中旬，閩江輪船公司的「青海號」汽艇在福州南平間的谷口附近被攜有輕機槍三挺的百餘距眾攔刧；四月六日公路總局第一運輸處的閩浙贛聯運班車在建甌古田間的玉山街附近囂巔鋪也遭匪攔刧；但羅陳股却在三月底被保安團擊潰了</p>
<p>閩西的長江在戰前剿共時期，原是一度屬於中共的所謂「瑞金人民蘇維埃政權」的，雖說抗戰期間作爲福建內地的重要城市把它的色彩沖淡了一點，但其社會的不　則是必然。現在活躍在閩西和腹心地區的股匪打多源自長江·連城等縣，永安·明溪·沙縣·大田都實際上是　們的自由天地。在省城很多有這一帶匪患消息的新聞，著名的劉　　去歲曾吃過一次大虧，今年也沒有　著活動，可是從來人嘴里，亦可知道局勢並不就是真正的平靖，「土共」正在腹地一帶膨脹，他們在甲鄉住一個時期，修養補充，宣傳抗徵，再到乙鄉去活動，向乙鄉借一批，除了歸還甲鄉所借外還可供他們在乙鄉使用的糧食，依此類推，最後在某個地方打開個田賦谷倉。可知遁山岳地區里正埋伏着將來的隱憂。</p>
<p>在濱海一帶，是近幾個月來匪　最多的地區，黃田·仙遊·福清·長樂，幾無淨土。尤其是黃田，三月上旬，漚江鎮公所，高妙鄉公所先後被匪攻刧，自衛隊全體被繳械；三月中旬，黃石，遊洋，笏田三鎮鄉的田糧賦谷運　被匪打開招呼成千萬的暴民搶刧。福廈公路行車安全毫無保障，平均每十天有一次客貨車被攔刧，　　仙兩縣抗征運動如火如荼，三月中旬楓亭鎮附近山頭處處烽火，政府的設施統統關在城圈自裏。朱兼主席從廈門北巡泉州以後，也認爲遍地區問題正是福州與廈門間的交通孔道必由之地。福清平化鄉的古倉在三月中旬運　被暴民搶刦兩次，三月二十一日武裝民眾百餘人號一度要攻略縣城，沿公路的漁溪鎮在二十八日失陷，警察全被繳械，古倉洗刦一空，匪徒們竟還殺掠一日夜之久才離去。長樂縣各鄉鎮公所，在三月中旬接二連三的被　　，匪徒們收繳槍械，搶攔倉庫，煽動抗征，成了一套公式。就連海上也是不安甯的，連江海外的東海島上在四月初　到大批海匪，肆擾漁民，與化　口南日島海面的海盜霓假日海關巡艇刦掠商船。</p>
<p>福州週遭是林森縣，論理應該是治安首義之區，但三月中旬，白沙·滬興等地鎮先後都有匪警，攻繳自衛隊的槍械。閩中的股匪在組織上似乎是散漫的，但在行動上却有一致的作法，就是前面所說的那套公式：收繳槍械，搶擄倉庫，竄動抗征、</p>
<p>朱兼主席早在三月十二日對省參會議報告施攻時就指出過：在各地發生的許多紛擾中，「最値得注意的，一是閩粵邊去股距劉永生等股，不斷向境內擾亂，使閩西南八九縣的安甯秩序均受威脅；一是閩北方面的散匪，死灰複燃，擄人搶糧，製刦車船事件，　有發生，這些雖都是局部的現象，却不應任它蔓延。」然而，不幸在最近一個月來，這些「局部的現象」竟已蔓延得使福建全省萑苻遍地了。</p>

<h3>貴陽府會之爭</h3>
<p>— 記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>記者僅就報導實立場，作客觀之綜述如次：</p>
<p>貴陽市參詳會</p>
<p>於三月二十七日起，召開第十二次大會，有幾位參議員因感觸特多，準備要好好的利用這次大會，對市政府來一個全面詢問，市府各首長在未開會前也好像是得了「情報」一樣，預備得相當周到。果然，開會不久，事件便接二連三的拼發出來了。事件起自二十八日上午張致祥市長出席議會作施政總報告後，議員先生們不斷的詢問，甚至有不少的難題，很可以使市長無法答復。好在張市長為人處世，向來和平，誠懇，所有的詢問和建議，他卻逐一的不厭其詳的答復，並且坦白表示，願意誠懇接受，這給議員先生們非常滿意，第一關算是撞過了。</p>
<p>當天下午，議場中拼發出第二次事件。議長陳虎先生宣佈：請新聞記者及來賓們退席，他們臨時變更議程要舉行檢討會，以各議員根據市民請願的線索親自出馬到失去之橋，龍洞堡兩車站，查得稅捐稽征處職員有違法舞弊的證據，市府民政科主管人員於辦理商業登記時利用職權，經一位姓徐的參議員在市府看見「天下報」的訂單，認為主辦人員有壓迫商民訂報，違法賣職嫌疑。這兩件事，都經議員先生們搜集證據，公開提成為檢舉案，認為該府稅捐稽征處長陳超華，民政科張劉先識貪污賣職，要送請張市長查辦，並同時備文向貴陽地方法院監察處，請求他們依法偵訊。</p>
<p>兩顆炸彈投燃之後，市府民政科經辦商業登記的職員鄧便於次日在貴州日報上發表「談話」，詞句之間，過於認真。同時他並向地方法院控告陳議長和徐參議員。這一「談話」對於市參議會不啻誤會之上再加誤會，當天下午全體參議員，一致決議，要請張市長幾日到會加以說明。</p>
<p>卅一日的上午大會，議員先生到得特別整齊，新聞記者和來賓也比那次大會來得多，真是一個熱鬧場面，大家都以為將有好戲上演。張市長準時到會，從容不迫的對於鄧　所發表的「談話」，應有其個人負責。兩樁檢舉案</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽十九日航訊〕　日政府與市參議會所鬧得「府會之爭」，已經三週了，在這平靜如水的山城裏，　　　，　的是泛起了一陣陣的漣漪，更進而由無形變為有形，山滑流快變成洪渺了，雙方大有不較量一番誓不甘休之勢。關於此事，真是見仁見智，各有看法不同，旣經參議會兩送市府請求查辦，並請地院檢查處偵訊，決定接受市參議會的意見辦理，將陳處長·劉科長·「先行停職，聽後法院偵訊」。不料一個充滿了火藥氣味的議場，竟因張市長的謙和誠懇，簡簡單單的幾句話即行煙消火滅，第二關又算是撞過了。</p>
<p>事件接着事件</p>
<p>問題連着問題，以為平靜無事了，殊知爭執更大。在市府方面，認為陳處長劉科長雖經市參議會檢舉為貪污賣職，並已函請地院偵訊，市府方面對於陳劉只能給以行政處分，把他們先行停職，聽後法院偵訊，也就算是最尊重民意機關的意思了。如果法院偵訊結果，陳劉果屬有罪，自當依法解職歸案，這是他們「做得受得」。要是法院偵訊結果，陳劉罪嫌不足，對於一個並不是「凡官必貪」的善良公務員，也應該依法保障讓他們回覆原職，免得許許多多努力自愛的公務員寒心。可是，市參議會方面的看法有些兩樣：他們認為貪污證據確鑿，毋可質疑。市長既允先行停職，兩人就應該即日離職，不得再在市府辦公，聽後法院偵訊，市府應該備文把他們送過去，何以久無消息，形成一個拖延局面，這使他們民意機關的面子太難為情。相反的，市府職員鄧恐高陳議長和徐參議員的事，到一天認真一天了，這更容易使他們發生懷疑。於是原本八天的會期，決定天天開會長期順延了。</p>
<p>議會長期延會之後，雙方便轉入「冷仗」階段，各自所發的新聞稿，好像都很有理由，這一來，害得二十多萬市民對於「府會之間」所起的紛爭，更是愈來愈莫名其妙。陳議長不得不晉見谷正倫主席，說明檢舉案是對事不對人，府會之間並無異見。他對於市府的總續措置，不能不加緊的注意，會經訪問過省府秘書長何朝宗，並且行文市府，探詢他執行情形如何。不久，市府的復文來了，可是在「停職」二字之後，拖上了一個「留任」的尾巴，這又使參議會認為張市長未免太開玩笑了，顯然是無誠意腹行前次在議會所發表的諾言。但市府方面的措置，純粹是依照「公務員任用法」以及「公務員態度條例」，他們說，在法院未實佈偵訊結果以前，必須依法保障罪證未定的會議員。這樣一個一撞，府會之間的</p>
<p>鴻溝愈來愈深而距離也就愈遠了。</p>
<p>四月十二日午後，市參議會公開招待全市士紳，各業理事長，新聞記者，率性源源本本的將搜集到的各項證據，甚至有關票據年月日分碼及刊職這項消息的報紙，一古腦兒向社會人士公開攤牌，一面準備無限期延會抗議，表示犒濫大家搞犒濫。據十二日陳議長在其辦公室內透露驚人消息，聞張市長現在準備以烏紗帽和他拼，意思要不是張市長丟烏紗，便是一會解散。陳議長說張市長如果真以烏紗帽和他拼，議會是無職務無官階的，並且各醫院均是無薪可支的，醫院們不幹也無啥希奇、真的這樣，所為一向和諧的「府會一家」變不得不宣告離婚了。</p>
<p>省政府看見政府與民意機關爭執起來，都各有一套理由，而且類似的事，並不只是見於貴陽市，為了適應需要，公佈了「劉分市縣府會權能」的消息，大意是依照貴州省政府政治</p>
<p>改革方案規定</p>
<p>指示如下要點：（一）縣市參議會之決案，如縣市政府認為不當時，應報請省府核示。（二）人民向縣市參議會請願時，縣市參議員依法無權處理。（三）縣市參議員在會場中對報告人之詢問，如已達侮辱程度時，應負法律責任。（四）縣市參議員開會期間為顧及事實及節省開支，改為六個月一次。（五）縣市參議會依法不得設置駐會委員。這一個單行法規定之後，大家都明白，府會鬧劇已經期了高潮，或許距離閉幕的時間不遠了。接著，雙方的</p>
<p>和談代表出馬，第三方面也出來以「杯酒言歡」的老法子幹旋，據悉，解決方案寂靜擬妥，要停職的陳劉兩人，一方面不再堅持定要「離職」，改為「暫行休息」，聽後法院偵訊。一方面不再堅持定要「留任」，改為就各該處科原有的資深科員中派人「代理」處科長職務，要是將來方圓真虛結果予以不氣所處分，當然依法復職，可是目前總要「暫行休息」，並且還要把所派的代理處科長職務的人，青島參議會去正式和參議員見面，說這是股權「面子」、實際上，這次「府會之爭」不過是表面文章，幕後似乎還大有新聞。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Hangzhou, 1st] According to information from the Hangzhou Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway: All trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway are operating normally and without obstruction on the 1st. The stations along the line remain as calm as before. However, there have been slight changes in train schedules, entirely due to the low number of passengers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from this City] Military Intelligence: (1) More than 3,000 bandits attacked Wujiang County City on the evening of the 30th. After a brief but fierce battle with our defending troops, we retreated to the second line of defense at Pingwang according to the pre-arranged plan. (2) Zhitang, east of Changshu, remains under our military control.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch from Hangzhou, 1st] The Communist army entered Zhejiang in two routes. One route advanced from Suzhou along the Sujia Road to Shengze on the outskirts of Jiaxing. Last night, a grand fire broke out in Shengze, and the Guojun retreated to the suburbs of Jiaxing City. The other route advanced south from Yixing along the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway, dividing its forces into two routes to capture Hangzhou. On the 30th, they attacked Pingyao from Wukang. The Pingyao-Shangbai line has been completely abandoned. That area is only 40 kilometers away from Hangzhou City. The other route attacked Tanglou from Deqing, surrounding Linping to cut off the Shanghai-Hangzhou line.</p>
<p>[Central Dispatch from this City] According to station information released by the military at 9:30 PM on the 1st: (1) Taicang is peaceful and secure, with a large number of Guojun troops stationed there, and morale is high.

(3) After our army proactively withdrew from Wujiang County City, a Communist army of about one regiment invaded the city this morning. (4) West of Kunshan, the 29th Army, due to being blocked by our elite troops, has retreated to the vicinity of Weiting, and morale is low.

<h3>Zhou Yan and Yu Jimin Are Stationed in Hangzhou; Order in the City Is Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>There are tasks. On the 29th, they withdrew from the urban area and are now being replaced by the 2nd and 3rd regiments of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Force. The Provincial Capital Supervisory Brigade withdrew to the south bank of the Qiantang River. Over a thousand police officers from various bureaus remained in the city to maintain public order. In addition, the Hangzhou Workers' Picket Team has been organized, with over one thousand six hundred members. They began patrolling the urban area on the evening of the 30th. Their main task is to ensure public utilities and equipment in major factories. Three thousand military officers from Hangzhou who are currently in their hometowns have joined the Provisional Relief Committee to serve as picket groups, presided over by Zhang Bawan, and jointly assist in maintaining Hangzhou's public order along with the Workers' Volunteer Fire Brigade and the People's Self-Defense Forces. Furthermore, the Provisional Relief Committee, deeply concerned that the closure of 19% of shops in the city would leave ordinary citizens with no place to buy daily necessities and easily lead to misunderstandings, dispatched personnel to various shops on the 1st to persuade them to open for business.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Hangzhou, 1st] After the Hangzhou City Defense Command withdrew, the security mission was reassigned to the 4th Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Force, and the 2nd Regiment came to Hangzhou to take over. The city's order is further stabilizing, and some stores have opened for business. Although the 1st was a regular Sunday holiday, Mayor Yu Jimin of this city and the chiefs of various bureaus were still at the office. Due to the recent tense situation, over twenty senior city government officials who had left their posts without permission were summarily dismissed by Mayor Yu on the 1st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Hangzhou, 1st] Hangzhou is actively preparing for emergencies. The Provisional Relief Committee held a meeting on the 30th. Since the city defense garrison had been withdrawn, it was decided that the security of the city would be maintained by a picket team organized by military officers who are currently in their hometowns, in coordination with the Volunteer Police Brigade, administrative police remaining in the city, the Fire Brigade, and various people's organizations. They also launched a fundraising campaign for emergency expenses, with each household contributing one silver dollar, and prepared 10,000 dan of grain for immediate needs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Hangzhou, 31st] Some members of the Hangzhou Municipal Government have relocated to Ningbo. Those remaining in Hangzhou continued to work as usual on the 30th. Mayor Yu Jimin stated that no matter how tense the situation, he would not leave Hangzhou until the very last minute. Furthermore, the Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal Government received a hand-written order from the Mayor on the 30th, stating that the issuance of National Identity Cards would be suspended immediately.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Flies from Guangzhou to Guilin; Guilin Pacification Headquarters Established Yesterday</h3>

<p>[Associated Press Dispatch from Guangzhou, 1st] It is reported that military leaders decided at a meeting here to step up assistance in defending Central China. This guarantee was made by Premier He Yingqin to Bai Chongxi, the military commander of Central China. Bai told reporters after the meeting that Hankou would be defended to the end. After Bai reported that Hunan and Hubei provinces were firmly supporting the Central Government as a rear guard in resisting the Communist invasion, Bai's Deputy Chief of Staff stated that Lin Biao's troops had about 100,000 men outside Hankou, confronting a larger force of government troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Guilin, 1st] The Guilin Pacification Headquarters held its inauguration ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 1st. All central and local government civilian appointees and military officers above the rank of lieutenant participated, with approximately one thousand attendees.

<h3>Air Force Pilot Zhang Escapes from Communist Area and Returns to Taiwan</h3>
<p>People in Communist Area Risk Their Lives to Protect Him</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch from Fuzhou, 1st] It is reported that Air Force 16th Squadron pilot Zhang was protected by people in the Communist area at the risk of their lives and safely returned to the free area and rejoined his unit in Taiwan. Zhang was forced to go to Jinan during a flight to Qingdao by a defector, and later forced to fly a hijacked Civil Aviation plane to Yang. Afterwards, Zhang refused to fly again, and citing the excuse of visiting relatives in his hometown in Ping, claimed illness and stayed there for two months. After fully understanding the hardship and lack of freedom in the lives of the people in Ping, Zhang firmly requested to return south to the Communist authorities. He was sent by train, saying that he could board a ship in Tianjin, but Zhang quickly realized that the Communist army had no good intentions, so he jumped off the train midway and escaped. He hid in the homes of local people for more than ten days, and was then helped by the people, who used silver dollars to buy him a travel permit and disguised him as someone going to Jinan to transfer to Qingdao. It is reported that the Communist army falsely named labor vehicles and assigned grain donations based on the number of pieces of furniture in each household, which the citizens could not afford. They dared to be angry but dared not speak. Even university professors were as timid as crickets. Zhang was deeply grateful for the courage of the people in the Communist area, who risked their lives to help the government Air Force escape despite the Communist army's strict control of the five-household guarantee system. It was no different from the stories of resistance during the Anti-Japanese War, which are happening today in the Communist area.</p>
<h3>Spokesman of the Shanghai-Wusong Garrison Command Analyzes the Military Situation; Communist Army Supply Lines May Be Cut Off at Any Time; Guojun Striving for Initiative</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] Zhang Taixiang, spokesman of the Shanghai-Wusong Garrison Command, analyzed the recent military situation at a press conference at 3:00 PM on the 1st. He pointed out that after crossing the river, the Communist army's military offensives are difficult to sustain rapidly, but a major crisis has been laid, that is, their supply lines may be cut off at any time. If they encounter setbacks, their defeat will also be like the Yangtz River's ten thousand li. Zhang said that the victory or defeat of a military operation is not determined by the gain or loss of a city or a place, but by annihilating the opponent's main force. The Guojun is currently striving for the initiative, and its main force is still maintained. Warfare is like gambling, with "waiting," "enduring," and "being ruthless" being the secrets. The Guojun's "waiting" and "enduring" will soon pass, and thereafter, it will seize the opportunity to "be ruthless." Regarding Shanghai, Zhang complained that some people hope that the Communist army will not attack or that the Guojun will not resist when the Communist army attacks, so as to avoid losses, which is ridiculous. The Communist army's slogan includes the phrase "liquidate Shanghai," so they will definitely not relax their grip on Shanghai. The Guojun in Shanghai is determined to defend the city to the death. If the Communist army comes to attack, it will be the time for the Guojun to "be ruthless." Zhang emphasized that the current war is a war of freedom and democracy against violence and terror, so he believes that freedom and democracy will ultimately prevail.</p>

<h3>Chinese Communists Demand That Britain, the United States, and France Withdraw Troops from China; and Claim to Be Willing to Consider Establishing Diplomatic Relations with Various Countries</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Dispatch from San Francisco, 30th] The Xinhua Radio Station in Beiping broadcast on the 30th the life of the spokesman of the People's Liberation Army Command, demanding that Britain, the United States, and France quickly withdraw their troops, warships, and military aircraft from China, while allowing the protection of foreign nationals engaged in legitimate professions in China, and willing to consider establishing diplomatic relations with various countries, provided that the governments of each country first sever relations with the National Government. Most of the statement directly rebuked Churchill's proposal that Britain send more warships to Chinese waters and refuted Attlee's statement regarding the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River. According to the statement, the British naval gunfire caused 252 casualties to the Communist army. The British committed such a great crime in Chinese territory that the People's Liberation Army can demand that the British government admit its mistake, apologize, and compensate. After refuting part of Attlee's statement, the statement continued, the People's Liberation Army does not hope that any country will provide assistance in crossing the river or other actions. On the contrary, the People's Liberation Army demands that Britain, the United States, and France quickly withdraw their armed forces, warships, military aircraft, and marines from the Yangtze River, the Huangpu River, and other locations in China by sea, land, and air, and no longer assist the enemies of the Chinese people in engaging in civil war. Up to now, the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government have not established diplomatic relations with any foreign government. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government are willing to protect all foreigners engaged in legitimate professions in China, and are willing to consider establishing diplomatic relations with various countries. However, the establishment of this relationship should be based on equality, reciprocity, and mutual respect for each other's independence and territorial integrity. First, all countries should not assist the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government do not want to be threatened by any action by any government. If the governments of various countries wish to consider establishing diplomatic relations with the Communist government, they must sever relations with the remaining forces of the Kuomintang and withdraw armed forces from China. Attlee said that because the Chinese Communists have not established diplomatic relations with various countries in the past, they are unwilling to have relations with foreign diplomats. This statement is unfounded. The governments of the United States, Britain, and Canada have assisted the Kuomintang against the Communists in the past. Has Attlee forgotten this? Who was it that recently supplied the recently sunk heavy cruiser Chongqing? Britain used a cruiser to subsidize the Kuomintang government, and when the Kuomintang government's plane was about to defect to the Chinese Communists, it bombed and sank it.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department and Embassy Maintain Contact</h3>

These guards have withdrawn and resumed several times. Although Ambassador Stuart has not left the embassy, three embassy officials left the embassy on the 30th without any trouble." McDermott said that the State Department is still in contact with the embassy and did not mention the arrest of any officials at the embassy.</p>

Personnel on the "Haven" refused to provide any information, and reporters were denied entry to the naval dock where the ship was berthed. Unconfirmed reports say that one of all the war victims on the ship has already died during the journey to Hong Kong. Besides, The "Haven" also carried one hundred and ten US citizens evacuated from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>US Congressional Committees to Meet This Week; Chennault to Testify, Report on Aid to China; Senate Debates China Policy, Hopes for Increased Support</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, April 30] Chennault, at the invitation of Senators Nolan and McClellan, will appear before the House and Senate Foreign Aid Oversight Committees and the Senate Armed Services Committee next week to present his views on American aid to China. Nolan said that Chennault will report to the Senate Armed Services Committee on the morning of the 3rd on the situation in China and its impact on US national defense.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, April 30] Hopes for a Senate debate on US China policy have been strengthened by two developments. One is the hint from Democratic Senator McClellan, and the other is the testimony of prominent China experts before two congressional committees this week. McClellan's hint is that he has not denied reports that some Democrats and Republicans are jointly pressing for an investigation into the government's China policy and forcing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to submit the McClellan Aid to China Bill to the Senate. Testimony on the current situation in China will be presented by Major General Chennault of the Flying Tigers to the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee. According to Senate Minority Leader Hurlburt and senior Republican Bridges of the Appropriations Committee, they met with President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson at the White House on the 28th to discuss the situation in China. The two Republicans said after the meeting that they had learned some previously unknown facts, but both called for a "comprehensive review" of China policy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Cleveland, April 30] Progressive Party leader Henry Wallace said on the 30th that the current situation in China "never needed to happen." Wallace said, "What is happening in China is an example of what could happen elsewhere. A proper agreement between Washington and Moscow could prevent military activity in China."</p>

<h3>The Mystery of Xikang</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>Disputes, Liu Wenhui trapped in Ya'an, at a loss. Xikang, where Han and Yi peoples coexist, is a difficult place, with stubborn and precious people, hidden fortunes, and inexhaustible resources, is our country's most promising natural treasure. The governance and chaos of Kang are attracting national attention. Here, the reporter provides an objective report on the inside story of the Kang unrest.</p>
<p>True Picture of the Ya'an Unrest: Armed Fights and Resistance to Suppression</p>
<p>The Xikang unrest has spread to the Ya'an and Ning districts. The Ya'an district includes the areas of Rongjing, Tianquan, and Lushan. The cause is armed fights and "resistance to suppression." The Ning unrest is the conflict between Deng (Deliang) and Sun (Fang). The Ya'an district armed fights involve Rongjing and Tianquan. The "Rongjing Incident" is due to uneven quality and conflicting powers between Tian Wei, the Speaker of the County Assembly, and Chen Bochang, the Deputy Speaker. The two sides mobilized tens of thousands of henchmen and engaged in fierce battles. The "Tianquan Incident" is a large-scale armed fight among the four major clans of Xun, Zhou, Shu, and Gong in the area due to competition for local power. The expansion of the two major armed fights has caused local chaos. The Tianquan and Rongjing areas have been in a state of terror for the past six months. The "resistance to suppression" is the most complex and largest in scale. It has been brewing for several months. Currently, there are over 30,000 people claiming to be the "People's Self-Defense Army," composed of members of the Gelaohui, bandits, and some "Kenshe" personnel from the Sichuan-Kang border. The leaders are Li Yuanning, Li Xianchun, Zhu Shizheng, Chen Zhiwu, Gao Ronglian, etc., who were involved in the previous "Ya'an District Incident," and their momentum is huge. Liu Wenhui rushed back to Ya'an from Chengdu to take charge. The rebel army advanced in three routes from Tianquan, Zheshan, and Rongjing to join forces. The war once spread to Feixian Pass, south of Ya'an City. This is the heart of Xikang's troubles today, and the war is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Expansion of the Unrest: Complex Reasons</p>
<p>The origins of the Ya'an District Incident are long and complex. From the first Ya'an unrest in 1946 to today, dark currents have been brewing in Kang, and there has never been a day of stability. The crux of the matter is "resistance to suppression." Originally, opium cultivation in Xikang was due to barren land and poverty. Liu Wenhui's governance of Kang for over a decade relied entirely on "public opium" to make up for the lack of military and financial resources. Cunning people took advantage of this to engage in wrongdoing and illegal profiteering. Mountainous border residents exchanged opium for food and various materials from outside, resulting in widespread opium addiction in Xikang. Talking about banning opium is truly deeply rooted and difficult to eradicate. At the same time, all real power in the Ya'an district was in the hands of Liu Wenhui's nephew, Liu Yuancong, who was a well-known "three generals" type: crude, greedy, and insatiable. The army specialized in protecting opium cultivation and trafficking, and competed with local tycoons for power and profit, leading to long-standing animosity. The last Ya'an District Incident was caused by this chaos. After the unrest was quelled, a "post-incident review meeting" was held in Ya'an, and local people demanded that Liu Wenhui be determined to ban opium, but first, protecting opium cultivation and trafficking meant protecting powerful figures, and second, enforcing the ban inevitably led to favoritism and corruption, leading to "resistance to suppression" and then "unrest." The authorities failed to use political means to guide the situation, turning it into the politically charged "Ya'an unrest" of today.</p>
<p>Ning District Unrest: Deng-Sun Conflict</p>
<p>The Ning District Incident is the conflict between Deng (Deliang), the commander of the Jingbian, and Sun (Fang). This is a border legend with a strong feudal consciousness. Deng is the eldest son of Deng Xiuting, the former "King of Southern Kang," and Sun is an old subordinate of Deng Xiuting. Deng Xiuting was an extraordinary figure among the Yi people of Ning. Because he had always leaned towards the government, had a clear mind, and was progressive in his thinking, he had great authority among the Yi people. The government relied heavily on his power to handle Yi affairs in the border area [using Yi to govern Yi]. When Liu Wenhua governed Kang, he appointed him as the Jingbian commander, and Zhang Qianlun, the director of the Xichang Xingyuan, forged a bond with him by marrying their children. His subordinates possessed four to five thousand elite Yi soldiers. After Deng Xiuting's death, his forces were divided into two factions: one faction, headed by Sun Fang, the deputy commander of the border, and the other faction, supporting Deng Deliang to succeed him. The actual power was in the hands of Deng's mother. At that time, the government, remembering Deng Xiuting's twenty years of hard work in securing the border, retained all of his troops and handed them over to Sun Fang for full command. In addition, He Guoguang, the commander of the Xichang Garrison, recommended Deng Deliang to the central government for training. Deng's mother requested that her son be appointed to succeed Deng Xiuting's position, but this was not approved. After Deng Huaye returned to Kang, the central government appointed him as the Jingbian deputy commander and Jingbian regiment commander, but Deng's mother again firmly requested that Deng be the commander and have full command of the troops. To maintain its authority, the central government again refused and welcomed Sun to Chang from the Xichang Garrison to take office. Deng refused to accept the new order, and the two sides had a conflict over power.</p>
<p>Lexi Highway: Bloody Battles for Over Ten Days</p>
<p>The conflict between Deng and Sun intensified. The Kang provincial authorities and local figures tried to mediate to eliminate the possibility of war, but to no avail. Deng Deliang set up his own command headquarters, appointed regimental commanders and other officers, and mobilized heavy troops to gather in Luguhu, with Xiaomiao, Lizhou, Yichen, and Songlin as defense lines. Deng took office in Luguhu on his own and issued proclamations, and the situation became increasingly escalated. He Guoguang returned to Chang from Chongqing for this purpose and convened an expanded meeting of key figures from all parties in Ning to discuss solutions. The meeting unanimously advocated that, in order to maintain local order and safeguard national discipline, the principle of peaceful and generous compromise should be adopted to end the conflict. He Guoguang and Zhang Qianlun again used public and private relations to send representatives to persuade both sides, but no agreement was reached due to the great disparity of interests, and they went to war. Deng Deliang's troops mobilized three regiments of the Jingbian, plus the Han troops of Deng Yukai, Deng Yujun, Deng Yuhua, and Luo Keqing, totaling over 1,500 men, and over ten tribes of Yi soldiers, including Changjia Wujiao, Luomu Ga, and Zhuzhi Qi, totaling 5,600 guns. Sun Fang's troops mobilized five battalions of the Jingbian, plus over ten tribes of Yi soldiers, including Nazhi Dayu, with numbers comparable to Deng's troops. The two sides engaged in bloody battles along the Lexi Highway for over ten days, and the war is still continuing.</p>
<p>Xikang - a mysterious West. Solving the mystery of this spiritual region, in today's era of widespread conflict, is difficult to thoroughly clarify.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Talking About Evacuating the Population</h3>
<p>Since the breakdown of peace talks and the successive crossing of the Yangtze River by the Communist army, and the withdrawal of the National army from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Suzhou, the general public in Shanghai has directly felt that the flames of war are imminent. As a result, people's hearts are agitated, the streets and alleys are filled with wartime scenes, and social order, finance, and the economy have also fluctuated and fallen into chaos. This phenomenon not only directly hinders local security but also affects people's hearts. Therefore, we feel that the recent evacuation of the population and stabilization of society by the municipal military government is an urgent measure that requires the close cooperation of all citizens of the city.</p>
<p>Since the end of last month, the municipal military and political authorities have decided to thoroughly evacuate the city's population, stipulating that the entry of people from other areas be restricted, and forcibly evacuating citizens without national identification cards. They are also conducting surprise inspections at any time and place, and stipulating that water and land transportation should be used as much as possible, and the transportation of furniture is strictly prohibited to facilitate the evacuation of citizens. According to the population density of the city, it has been rising in a straight line towards the saturation point for the past three years. According to the general census of the city's population in October last year, the total population of the city was 5,448,466, the number of unemployed often accounted for more than 30%, and there were often 200,000 to 300,000 refugees, who often needed relief. In the past four months, refugees from various counties along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, as well as along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, have poured into the city, and the population has surged, already exceeding six million. And relief work is difficult to carry out, so evacuating the population is a pressing need.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to evacuating the population, a shocking picture of exile appears before our eyes. The old and weak are left in ditches, and the strong are scattered in all directions. Many docile people inevitably fall into the tragic situation of wives and children being separated and families being destroyed. As the saying goes, "Heaven and earth are not benevolent, and treat all things as straw dogs." Past experiences of exile during wars tell us that the most important thing in evacuation work is the allocation of transportation and the maintenance of traffic order, all of which must have a comprehensive plan. Not only should the black market for boat tickets and train tickets be completely eliminated, but also preferential measures should be formulated to facilitate citizens' purchase of tickets. However, just as the Shanghai Municipal Population Census and Evacuation Joint Executive Office was established, and the notice to citizens on the evacuation of the population was published, the prices of train and plane tickets were all changed to silver dollar pricing, which undoubtedly adds a strong obstacle to the evacuation of the population. We know that citizens with a strong economic foundation in the city left for Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Taiwan as early as three months ago, and as late as last week. Today, those who are forced to evacuate are mostly petty people who are unable to escape, or refugees who have just arrived in Shanghai and have not yet gained a foothold. How can they have the means to purchase plane, ship, or train tickets? And how will they live after evacuating? These are all things that the wise military and political authorities should consider for the people.</p>
<p>I remember that during the Anti-Japanese War, before the fall of Guilin, there was an emergency evacuation, from Liuzhou to Yishan, Hechi, and refugees were endless on the road, without any complaints. The central government was able to send senior officials to Duyun, Dushan, Jinchengjiang, and other places in time to provide emergency relief, rescue refugees, and invite people from the cultural community to Guizhou to transfer to Chongqing. At that time, the troops of Commander-in-Chief Tang happened to be ordered to go to the front line of Guizhou to provide support; and Gu Zhenggang, who recently took office as the Political Affairs Commissioner of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, personally went to the front line in his capacity as Minister of Social Affairs that day, and comforted the people amidst the gunfire and bullets. Coincidentally, Tang and Gu are both in this city today, shouldering the military and political tasks of defending Greater Shanghai. With their support and the support of the municipal authorities, we believe that the evacuation work will definitely be easy and smooth, and everything will be well-organized. We will definitely protect the suffering people from disaster and danger, and all disasters can be turned into safety. But we still want to put forward a few suggestions for the authorities to consider.</p>
<p>First, transportation should be requisitioned and applied as much as possible, centrally supplied and allocated, evacuation trains should be added, evacuation ships should be dispatched, and outbound citizens should be given special treatment. The silver dollar pricing method should be abolished first, and it is best to provide large-scale free transportation.</p>
<p>Second, living conditions during the journey should be maintained, and safety during the journey should be guaranteed to the best of our ability. In particular, the inspection of ships and vehicles must be strictly enforced. The bloody tragedy of the Jiangya and Taiping shipwrecks is still fresh in our minds, and capsizing and other situations also occur from time to time. The lives of displaced refugees are already miserable enough, and they must not encounter unexpected dangers again.</p>
<p>Third, the outbound population should be planned and settled. The authorities should urgently designate evacuation areas, consult with the local leaders and local people to properly settle the incoming population. Don't send them out of Shanghai and then ignore them, letting them wander around the world; or use your neighbor as a ditch, which will only increase the number of refugees in that area.</p>
<p>In short, in the current dangerous environment, evacuating the population is indeed an urgent task; but the people of Shanghai have repeatedly experienced war and suffered greatly. Now that the flames of war have reached the doorstep, the weight and pain of their hearts is self-evident. The military and political authorities should especially show compassion and must not deepen the suffering of the people by evacuating the population!</p>
<h3>Jessup Reports to Acheson on Results of Talks with Soviet Union; England and France to Participate in Next Meeting</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, April 30] Well-informed sources recently stated that US representative Jessup and Deputy Foreign Minister Malik have met twice this week to discuss the conditions for lifting the Berlin blockade and have made progress. The scope of negotiations will soon be expanded to include British representative Cadogan and French representative Chauvel. This kind of negotiation will in fact be a preliminary step towards a four-country foreign ministers' meeting. The representatives will also arrange the procedures and date for the four foreign ministers' meeting. The Soviet Union, England, and France seem to have agreed that the foreign ministers' meeting should be held in Paris in late May. There will be no new developments in the discussion of the issue within days. Jessup has gone to Washington to report face-to-face to Secretary of State Acheson on the results of his talks with the Soviet representative.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, April 30] Reliable sources here said that after the Berlin blockade is lifted, a four-power meeting can be convened on May 15. The French Foreign Ministry, after receiving a phone report from its representative to the United Nations, Chauvel, is convinced that the lifting of the Berlin blockade is only a matter of days.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, April 30] People close to the Soviet military government revealed that the Soviet intelligence chief Tubanov predicted today that the Berlin blockade, which has lasted for ten months, will be lifted within 72 hours. However, a British military spokesman said that he was not aware of this. Tubanov told the editor of the Soviet district newspaper this afternoon that the main issues related to traffic restrictions between Berlin and West Germany have been resolved by the four powers, and the lifting of the blockade is expected to begin within the next three days, and a foreign ministers' meeting can be convened soon.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, May 1] London officials have taken a reserved attitude towards the news from Berlin that the Berlin blockade will be lifted soon. It is believed here that the three military governors of West Germany, England, the United States, and France are still waiting for new instructions from the three governments after receiving a report on the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Berlin issue. The technical issues regarding the removal of the blockade are still to be discussed further in New York or Berlin.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, April 30] The President of the United Nations General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, made a statement today, predicting that the Berlin blockade can be lifted soon. It is said that there are now various reasons to believe that the Berlin dispute can be ended and the blockade can be lifted as soon as possible. The resolution of this matter is a great delight to the United Nations organization because international peace and justice have been advanced one step. The resolution of the Berlin issue does not mean the resolution of the entire dispute between the great powers, but other issues have also gained new contact. This is not only the case with the German issue, but also with the Far East issue.</p>
<h3>West Germany Deploys to Restore Berlin Land Transportation; Waiting for Soviet Action; Soviet Attitude Towards Opening Shipping in the British Zone is More Moderate Than Before</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, April 30] West Germany has arranged the final plan for restoring Berlin's land transportation tonight, hoping that Moscow will issue an order to lift the Berlin blockade on May 1st Labor Day. According to news from Hamburg, West German railways are preparing to run 30 trains to Berlin in one day, including 20 coal trains.</p>
<p>Optimism here is strong after the Soviet authorities in Berlin responded favorably to two British requests yesterday, believing that the Soviet attitude seems to have completely changed. The Soviet side allowed that they will no longer interfere with canal traffic in the British sector of Berlin and apologized for the arrest of three British military police officers by the People's Police in the British-Soviet border area.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, April 30] The Soviet and British sides agreed on the 30th to completely free navigation in the canals in the western part of Berlin. This is the first important agreement between Eastern and Western countries since the Soviet Union began blockading Berlin last June. Soviet Transportation Director Major General Krashning and British Deputy Commander of the Berlin Occupying Forces Beson agreed at the meeting that ships registered with both the Soviet and British sides would be free to navigate in the canals in the western part of the city. The negotiations were initiated by Krashning and held at the headquarters of the Soviet occupying forces.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, April 30] The three British military police officers who were arrested by the Soviet side at the Memel Airport in the British sector yesterday have been released today after British protests. The three military police officers were ordered to investigate the incident of the Soviet police invading the British area and forcibly confiscating livestock, and the Soviet side believed that they had mistakenly entered the Soviet border. However, according to a British spokesman, they did not step into the Soviet border.</p>
<h3>Doolittle Advocates Avoiding War with the Soviet Union; Otherwise, Atomic Bombs Should Be Dropped in a Timely Manner</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, May 1] Retired Air Force Lieutenant General Doolittle, who led the first air raid on Tokyo seven years ago, said here in Georgetown on the 1st that the United States must make efforts to avoid war with the Soviet Union, but if signs of aggression appear, it must be prepared to drop atomic bombs at the first sign of aggression. He said that in the near future, war with the Soviet Union can be avoided if the United States remains strong, but permanent peace requires the combination of American military power, domestic and foreign education, and the revival of the world spirit.</p>
<h3>England Welcomes Greece to Participate in the European Conference</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, April 30] Well-informed sources said that Britain will welcome Greece and Turkey to participate in the European Conference. According to this, the conference, which will be convened here on May 3, will also make final revisions to the draft on the status of the European Parliament drafted by representatives of various countries here.</p>
<h3>The Netherlands Controls Only Cities and Roads in Indonesia; The Binnie Committee Submits a Report</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, April 30] The United Nations Indonesia Commission today released a report on the military situation in Indonesia, which concluded that in most of the areas administered by the former Indonesian Republic, the Dutch army only controlled the main cities and roads. In the areas of East Java that were controlled by the Dutch army before December 15, 1948, there was also a concentration of Indonesian Republican troops. Conflicts occurred from time to time in Java and Sumatra. Although there were many conflicts in the past two months, most of them were small-scale, with no more than two hundred people on each side each time. Only in the attack on Yogyakarta by the Republican army did the Indonesian side dispatch 1,500 people. In addition to the regular army of the Republic, there are also various guerrilla forces active in Indonesia. The United Nations Commission believes that unless a comprehensive political solution is reached, the economy cannot be restored, order cannot be restored, and the suffering of the people cannot be alleviated.</p>
<h3>To Resolve the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute, the United States Proposes a New Plan, Advocating that Indonesia Participate in the Hague Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, April 30] Dutch and Indonesian Republican leaders today studied a new solution to resolve the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. The case was informally proposed by American representative Kochran of the United Nations Mediation Team, advocating that before the Indonesian Republic is restored in Yogyakarta, Rom, the chairman of the Indonesian delegation, should be authorized by other Republican leaders to declare: (1) Approve the ceasefire order; (2) Firmly maintain that the Indonesian government should participate in the Hague Round Table Conference.</p>
<h3>Hungary and Bulgaria Abuse Clergy; Submitted to United Nations Countries to Stop; United Nations General Assembly Passes Resolution</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Flushing, April 30] The United Nations General Assembly tonight passed a resolution discussed by the Special Political Committee on the cases of Archbishop Stepinac and Bulgarian clergy, stipulating that all countries that have signed peace treaties with Hungary and Bulgaria are invited to take joint action in accordance with the provisions of the treaties to stop the destruction of democratic freedom by the two countries. Thirty-four countries voted in favor of this motion, six Slavic countries voted against, and nine countries, including Afghanistan, Burma, India, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen, abstained. The General Assembly has decided to place the two cases on the agenda of the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Suspects in Plot to Assassinate the King of Iran; Two Sentenced to Death; 200 of 300 Arrested Have Been Released</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, April 30] The official statement here stated that of the nine people accused of participating in the plot to assassinate the King of Iran, two have been sentenced to death today, and it is said that the rest have been sentenced to terms ranging from six months imprisonment to life imprisonment.

<h3>The United States Does Not Intend to Invite Spain to Participate in the Atlantic Treaty; The Senate Foreign Relations Committee May Pass It Next Week</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, April 30] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally said today that the committee will conclude the debate on the North Atlantic Security Treaty next week, and will pass it straight away.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, April 30] Observers here pointed out that Spain is currently unlikely to join the Atlantic Treaty, because the participation of Spain is unlikely to gain the support of two-thirds of the senators in the United States Senate. President Truman believes that any new treaty must be passed by two-thirds of the Senate before it can be established, and Spain's joining the Atlantic Treaty should also pass this procedure. Secretary of State Acheson said to Vandenberg during an inquiry in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he was instructed by the President to declare that any new country joining the Atlantic Treaty is actually equivalent to the United States signing a new treaty with that country, so according to the Constitution, the President hopes to request the approval of the Senate before he personally expresses his consent. When asked why Portugal was able to join the Atlantic Treaty, Acheson replied that this was the opinion of the signatory countries of the treaty, and inviting Portugal to participate was a unanimous decision of the founding countries, and they had not decided to invite Spain to participate. It is known that there are not a few senators in the House and Senate who advocate inviting Spain to join the Atlantic Treaty, and Catholics are particularly vocal about this.</p>
<h3>Lower House of Canada Approves Atlantic Pact</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 30th] The Canadian Lower House today unanimously approved the Atlantic Pact by a vote of 185 to 0. During a brief debate before the vote, the Canadian Prime Minister stated that he hoped the same convention would be signed in the short term, including the Soviet Union and all countries that signed the United Nations Charter at the San Francisco Conference.</p>
<h3>Wallace Criticizes Atlantic Pact, Demands US-Soviet Peace Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cleveland, 1st] Wallace denounced the "Vandenberg Cold War" and the "Truman Doctrine" on the evening of the 30th. He stated: The Atlantic Pact they support is doomed to fail. Wallace told the audience at the local music academy: "The path to peace is definitely not the Atlantic Pact." He said, "The Atlantic Pact will make Europe a second China." He called on the United States and the Soviet Union to build a truly strong United Nations so that both sides could begin planning for peace, not war, after regaining their conscience. This was Wallace's third major speech during his nationwide tour calling for the rejection of the Atlantic Pact.</p>
<h3>Turkey Reluctant to Join Atlantic Pact, Mediterranean Pact Formation Temporarily Impossible</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 30th] Turkish Prime Minister Gubanerdan stated while receiving reporters today, issuing a statement on his country's foreign policy: "Turkey has never been eager to join the Atlantic Pact. I believe that the establishment of a Mediterranean Pact is still impossible at present. If we do not participate in a convention that would increase our burden, it would be more beneficial to our position."</p>
<h3>Philippine Farmers' Army Denies Assassinating Mrs. Quezon</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 30th] Taruc, leader of the Farmers' Army Communist Party, denied today that his subordinates had planned to assassinate Mrs. Quezon. Taruc issued a statement to Manila newspapers from his secret headquarters on Luzon Island, stating, "We have never issued any order to harm Mrs. Quezon or her family. An investigation is currently underway, and if any negligence or violation of Farmers' Army discipline is found, the perpetrators will be severely punished." Meanwhile, government forces are still continuing their offensive in central Luzon against Farmers' Army Commander Venus, who instigated the tragedy.</p>
<h3>Burmese Government Committee Recommends to President to Temporarily Postpone General Election; Government Forces to Launch General Offensive in Upper Burma</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rangoon, 30th] Authoritative sources reported today that the Burmese Government's Commission of Seven-Eight, due to national unrest caused by the civil war, has recommended to the President to postpone the general election. According to the Burmese Constitution, the general election should be held within eighteen months of independence, i.e., around July 4 of this year. In other news, according to a government gazette announcement, a general offensive is about to be launched against the military in Upper Burma. Government forces drove straight down from Meiktila, eighty miles southwest of Mandalay, and have occupied Toungoo, where the Karen military headquarters of the Sittaung River in central Burma is located. When government forces advanced into another city 150 miles from Rangoon, the city was almost completely deserted. It is reported that most Karen people went to the Taikkyi area to participate in the offensive against Rangoon, leaving their rear exposed, which was taken advantage of by government forces.</p>
<h3>Moscow Commemorates May Day Labor Day, Grand Military Parade Held in Red Square</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 1st] Moscow commemorated May Day Labor Day today with a grand military parade before Marshal Stalin. Several military units concentrated in Red Square and were inspected by Vasilyevsky, Minister of Armed Forces, accompanied by Meretskov, Moscow Garrison Commander. Fighter planes and bombers, led by three new-style jet fighters, flew low over the two men. As the troops marched past Stalin, who stood on the reviewing stand, they raised their hands in salute. Surrounding him were Deputy Prime Ministers Molotov, Malenkov, and Marshal Bulganin, among others. As workers carrying portraits of the Stakhanovite movement, Soviet student heroes, and heroes of the Great Patriotic War marched before their leaders, following tanks, artillery, and mechanized cavalry regiments, tens of thousands of spectators shouted slogans of "Long live Stalin" and "Long live the Red Army and Communism," drowning out the sound of the military band. In his speech, Vasilyevsky denounced the aggressive political stance of the United States toward the Soviet Union and Eastern European democracies, calling on workers around the world to unite and defend peace. Similar military parades were also held in major Soviet cities such as Leningrad, Kyiv, and Sevastopol. In the aforementioned cities, thousands of enthusiastic spectators cheered for the Soviet Navy.</p>

<h3>Ingrid Bergman Rumored to Have Romance in Italy; Bergman's Husband Suddenly Flies from New York to Italy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 30th] Hollywood Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman's husband, Lindstrom, arrived here from New York by plane on the 30th. It is rumored here that Ingrid Bergman and famous Italian director Roberto Rossellini are having a romance. Lindstrom told reporters at the Rome airport: "I will go to a hotel in Rome." However, Lindstrom did not appear at the hotel. It is generally believed that Lindstrom may go directly to Naples to take a small boat to the island of Stromboli, where Ingrid and Roberto are filming.</p>
<h3>London Aglow with Lights and Flowers</h3>
<p>— Yingzhi</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from London] On the eve of the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, London, which has been dim for almost ten years, is once again brightly lit, allowing torches of various colors to illuminate the night. Although "the flower market is as brightly lit as before," other situations are completely different. This once world-renowned international political capital has moved from Downing Street to the White House. This economic hub that once controlled global wealth has moved from the Bank of London to Wall Street in New York. The once magnificent Bank of England is like a desperate royal descendant, shamelessly borrowing from its former "partners."</p>
<p>The Labor Party, in order to compete in the upcoming election and maintain its power, must please its voters. So, the day before the election in the Hammer Smith district of southwest London in late February, it announced that clothing was no longer rationed. Housewives, after buying a large number of tablecloths and tea towels, naturally thought of their roots and voted for the Labor Party, resulting in the Labor Party winning by a majority of 1,613 votes. Then, eggs were no longer rationed (although the author still only gets three eggs, not big or small, per week, and has not received an extra "mixed" egg), milk could be freely purchased, and the supply of sweets was no longer restricted (but the amount of meat was reduced to only eating shredded fried pork once a week - a British magazine attributed the reduction in meat to Argentine dictator Mrs. Perón, saying that the Argentine president's wife, Mrs. Perón, is the country's MADAME POMPADOUR. When she visited Britain last year, because Buckingham Palace did not invite her to a banquet, she angrily stopped supplying Britain with meat). Everything made people feel that World War II has slowly become a historical relic, and the trauma of war has gradually enveloped people's hearts. How long can this light, which was bought with blood and tears, last?</p>
<p>The author lives in the northern suburbs of London. Last night, eager to mail a letter to a friend vacationing in the Czech Republic, I took the subway into the city to mail the letter and took the opportunity to see the new London lights in the center of London. In Leicester Square, the cinemas are lined up next to each other, and the doors are shining brightly. Indeed, the streetwalkers under the colorful neon lights look much more radiant than before. - Their eyes are bright and their teeth are white, and they are younger. Further ahead is the famous Piccadilly Circus. Hey! The people watching the night view are packed to the rafters. Some are still supporting the old and carrying the young, standing on the street staring wide-eyed at the long-lost lights. The elderly may be recalling the glory of the British Empire in the past. The young have been born into hardship and have never seen these "city opening all night" wonders. The most eye-catching is the Bovril beef broth advertisement, designed as a kaleidoscope, with a burst of "fireworks" scattering countless colorful "sparks." Continuing along Regent Street, many shop windows are shining brightly. The most sophisticated department store, AUSTIN REED, did not install neon lights but bathed the entire building in soft yellow light. There is also the Ford Motor Company's window, which uses light blue lights to illuminate the shiny cars (British cars have also changed from the most conservative styles to streamlined ones. The purpose is to cater to the preferences of Americans - everything follows the lead of the United States, because they have money. What Britain needs is money!). Turning left again is Oxford Street, where all the shops sell women's fashion. Novel hats, colorful gloves, and the NEW LOOK spring clothes and evening dresses. But the shop owners are competing fiercely to attract customers who are rich merchants, and only they can casually buy a car, go to AUSTIN REED to dress themselves as a typical gentleman, and only those noble ladies can order those new spring evening dresses and ask their "gentlemen" to buy a new coat or a string of pearl necklaces!</p>
<h3>Turbulent Situation in Fujian</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Pu Dejie</p>
<p>Bandits Everywhere</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou and Hangzhou, 28th] The "security" problem, in Fujian and in any other rear province, is the most thorny issue. After General Zhu Shaoliang, director of the Fuzhou Pacification Headquarters and concurrently chairman of the province, took office, he first resolved to rectify the security work. He also admitted: "In the past six months, the security situation in this province has continued to expand due to external influences, causing many disturbances in various places." These many disturbances are manifested in the phenomenon of bandits everywhere today, and the situation in Fujian is becoming more turbulent.</p>
<p>Bandits, or "local communists," are active throughout the province, from Fuding, where northern Fujian borders Zhejiang, to Changting, where the west borders Jiangxi, to Yongding, where the south borders Guangdong, to Shaxian and Yongan in the interior, and Huangtian and Fuqing on the coast, and even Linsen County, which is located around the provincial capital of Fuzhou, reports are often heard. The police and security authorities are exhausted, and the local self-defense national teams are even more difficult to defend against. The failure of provincial administration to get on track in the past six months has made this security issue the most urgent task at present. Small groups of scattered bandits have become strong armed forces, and grass-roots bandits and pirates have become stained with political colors. This problem has suddenly become not simple.</p>
<p>The Liu Yongsheng gang in the Fujian-Guangdong border area is naturally the most noteworthy. The appointment of Yu Yingqi as the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in the Fujian-Guangdong border area does not require any explanation. The main force of the Liu gang is mostly active in Guangdong Province, and there are also two detachments in southern Fujian and western Fujian. They often attack townships in Zhangpu, Zhao'an, Yunxiao, Dongshan, Nanjing, Chengpu, Yongding, Shanghang, Longyan and other counties, robbing weapons and ammunition depots, and ambushing teams. According to official reports, the southern Fujian detachment, led by Li Zhongxian, has more than 500 men, and the western Fujian detachment, led by Jiang Heyan, has more than 200 men. However, the results of the bandit suppression last year were: 383 bandits killed, 319 bandits injured, 306 bandits captured, 258 bandits who turned themselves in, and 450 long and short guns and one submachine gun seized. The losses of the security regiment were: 18 soldiers killed in action, 1 officer and 22 soldiers wounded, 2 light machine guns, and more than 10 rifles. Moreover, they are "still in the process of searching and suppressing." It seems that the more this gang of bandits is suppressed, the more they increase. On February 22 of this year, more than 300 men from a part of the Liu gang attacked Kanshi Town in Yongding County, robbing more than 70,000 catties of taxes and distributing them to the poor. Until recently, on April 8, another group of more than 700 men disturbed Yanshi Town in Shanghang County, and fled to Guangdong after being besieged by the security team. This gang of bandits should be called "local communists," because according to official reports, their organization includes political commissars, women's teams, people's alliance groups, and so on.</p>
<p>In northern Fujian, it is rumored that there is an organization called "Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border Area People's Guerrilla Column," but in fact, the activities of the bandits are scattered. Fuding County and Xiapu County in the northeast corner are often harassed by the Zheng Zhou Danfu gang of bandits from southern Zhejiang. At the end of March, Huotong Town in Ningde County was attacked and plundered, and the county seat of Fujian was almost captured. The border between Zhenghe County and Qingyuan County in Zhejiang Province is the den of the Chen Gulao gang of bandits. As for Jian'ou, Nanping, and Gutian, they are the domain of the Zuo Timei gang, while the border between Mingxi, Jiangle, and Taining has the Luo Jiangbo and Chen Xiangsheng gangs singing the slogan "Supporting the Communist Party" and killing and setting fires. These gangs of bandits range from sixty or seventy to two or three hundred men, and do not necessarily have political awareness, so they often engage in highway robbery. In January, the Nanping Jin'ou section of the highway bridge was burned, and because of the "still lingering bandit atmosphere," it has not been fully repaired to this day. In mid-March, the "Qinghai" steamship of the Minjiang Shipping Company was intercepted by more than 100 bandits carrying three light machine guns near Gugou between Fuzhou and Nanping. On April 6, the Min-Zhe-Gan intermodal bus of the First Transportation Office of the Highway Administration was also robbed by bandits near Yushan Street between Jian'ou and Gutian. However, the Luo Chen gang was defeated by the security regiment at the end of March.</p>
<p>Changting in western Fujian was once part of the so-called "Ruijin People's Soviet Regime" of the Chinese Communist Party during the period of communist suppression before the war. Although its colors were diluted a bit as an important city in the interior of Fujian during the Anti-Japanese War, its social instability is inevitable. The gangs of bandits now active in western Fujian and the hinterland mostly originate from Changting, Liancheng, and other counties. Yongan, Mingxi, Shaxian, and Datian are actually their free territory. In the provincial capital, there are many news reports about bandit disasters in this area. The famous Liu gang suffered a great loss last year, and has not been very active this year. However, from the mouths of visitors, it can also be known that the situation is not truly peaceful. The "local communists" are expanding in the hinterland. They live in village A for a period of time, recuperate and replenish, promote resistance to taxation, and then go to village B to carry out activities, borrowing a batch of supplies from village B. In addition to returning what was borrowed from village A, they can also provide food for their use in village B. By analogy, they finally open a field tax granary somewhere. It can be seen that the mountain area is burying future hidden worries.</p>
<p>The coastal area has been the area with the most bandit disasters in recent months. Huangtian, Xianyou, Fuqing, and Changle are almost all impure lands. Especially Huangtian, in early March, the Oujiang Town Office and the Gaomiao Township Office were attacked and robbed by bandits one after another, and all the self-defense teams were disarmed. In mid-March, the transportation of field tax grains from Huangshi, Youyang, and Hutian towns and townships was opened by bandits, and tens of millions of rioters were robbed. The traffic safety on the Fuxia Highway is not guaranteed. On average, passenger and cargo vehicles are intercepted once every ten days. The anti-taxation movement in Xianyou and Putian counties is in full swing. In mid-March, beacon fires were everywhere on the mountains near Fengting Town, and all government facilities were locked in the city. After Zhu, who is also the chairman of the province, inspected Quanzhou from Xiamen, he also believed that the problem in the coastal area was precisely the necessary transportation route between Fuzhou and Xiamen. Gucang in Pinghua Township in Fuqing was robbed twice by rioters in mid-March. On March 21, more than 100 armed people once wanted to capture the county seat. Yuxi Town along the highway was lost on the 28th, and all the police were disarmed. Gucang was looted, and the bandits even killed and looted for a day and a night before leaving. The township offices in Changle County were attacked and robbed one after another in mid-March. The bandits collected guns, robbed warehouses, and incited resistance to taxation, which became a set formula. Even the sea is not peaceful. In early April, a large number of sea bandits arrived on Donghai Island off the coast of Lianjiang, wreaking havoc on fishermen, and the pirates on the sea near Nanri Island off the coast of Changle even robbed customs patrol boats and merchant ships.</p>
<p>Fuzhou is surrounded by Linsen County, which should be the area with the best security, but in mid-March, bandit alarms occurred successively in Baisha, Huxing, and other towns, attacking and seizing the guns of the self-defense team. The bandits in central Fujian seem to be scattered in organization, but they have a consistent approach in action, which is the set formula mentioned above: collecting guns, robbing warehouses, and inciting resistance to taxation.</p>
<p>As early as March 12, Zhu, who is also the chairman of the province, pointed out in his report to the Provincial Council that in the many disturbances that have occurred in various places, "the most noteworthy are the Liu Yongsheng and other gangs that are constantly disturbing the territory in the Fujian-Guangdong border area, threatening the peace and order of eight or nine counties in southwestern Fujian; and the scattered bandits in northern Fujian, who have rekindled their activities, looting people, robbing grain, and attacking cars and boats, have occurred from time to time. These are all local phenomena, but they should not be allowed to spread." However, unfortunately, in the past month, these "local phenomena" have spread to such an extent that bandits are everywhere in Fujian.</p>

<h3>Amidst the Drums of War, Singing and Dancing Everywhere; Entertainment Venues Are Crowded Again; Tourists Fill the Downtown Area</h3>
<p>[Our News] Although the flames of war are approaching the city, the general public, after the initial few days of tension and panic, have become numb. Except for financial chaos and soaring prices, the war atmosphere is not visible in this area. Entertainment venues such as cinemas and dance halls, which were once deserted, have been crowded again since the day before yesterday, fully reflecting the psychology of seeking stimulation and enjoyment at the end of the century. Yesterday was a regular holiday, and the downtown area was even more crowded with tourists, with singing and dancing everywhere. The leisure and prosperity made people wonder if a battle of life and death was taking place dozens of miles away. The general public's concern about the progress of the war is indeed no longer as worried as it was in the first few days. This fact is enough to prove that the public's enthusiasm for inquiring about war news has greatly diminished. The planes of various airlines flying south were unprecedentedly crowded at the beginning of last week. On average, one company had more than a dozen round-trip flights a day, which was not enough to meet the urgent needs of passengers. By the weekend, business had become sluggish. Those who could leave have left, and the five million citizens who remain in Shanghai are waiting for an unknowable future with numb hearts.</p>

<p>In the fourth table tennis league, Hualian faced off against Qinglian in Group A the night before last, with over 300 spectators in attendance. Hualian fought with great strength. Left-handed Zhang Zhihong fired the first shot, and Qinglian's Li Peiran relied on strategy to win back a game. After that, three veterans of Hualian, Li Zhen, Lu Wenliang, and Yang Zhixiong, showed their brilliance. Qinglian's main player, Liu Baotai, and others fought hard but to no avail, and eventually lost 1-4. The results of the two teams are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Hualian)  Score   (Qinglian)</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihong  2-1   Liang Menghui</p>
<p>Pan Rixi   1-2   Li Peiran</p>
<p>Li Zhen   2-0   Du Boru</p>
<p>Lu Wenliang  2-1   Liu Baotai</p>
<p>Yang Zhixiong  2-0   Tu Youci</p>
<p>The league has entered its fourth week of order from today. Tonight (2nd) from 7:00 PM, there will be one Group A game and three Group B games. In Group A, Qinglian will face off against Huamei again at the Postal Service ball room. Qinglian has lost all three games, and its morale has declined. Even if it puts all its strength into the fight today, it will definitely not be a match for Huamei. This battle will be a one-sided situation. The schedule for tonight is recorded below:</p>

<h3>The Dispute in Guiyang Prefecture</h3>
<p>— Reporter Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>As a reporter, I will only take a neutral stance to provide an objective summary as follows:</p>
<p>Guiyang City Council</p>
<p>Starting from March 27th, convened the twelfth general meeting. Several councilors, feeling particularly moved, prepared to make good use of this meeting to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the municipal government. Before the meeting, it seemed that the heads of the municipal government had also received "intelligence" and made thorough preparations. As expected, events erupted one after another shortly after the meeting began. The incident originated on the morning of the 28th after Mayor Zhang Zhixiang delivered a general report on his administration to the council. The councilors continuously questioned him, even raising many difficult issues that could have made it impossible for the mayor to answer. Fortunately, Mayor Zhang was consistently peaceful and sincere in his dealings with people. He answered all inquiries and suggestions patiently and in detail, and frankly expressed his willingness to accept them sincerely. This greatly satisfied the councilors, and they successfully navigated the first hurdle.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the same day, a second incident erupted in the council hall. Speaker Chen Hu announced: please ask the news reporters and guests to leave the room. They will be temporarily changing the agenda to hold a review meeting. Some councilors, based on the clues from citizens' petitions, had personally gone to the Lost Bridge and Longdongbao stations and found evidence of illegal malfeasance by officials of the Tax Bureau. When handling commercial registrations, the head of the Civil Affairs Section of the municipal government allegedly used his authority. A councilor surnamed Xu saw a subscription order for the "Tianxia Bao" in the municipal government and believed that the person in charge was suspected of forcing merchants and residents to subscribe to the newspaper and illegally selling his position. These two matters had been presented as accusations by the councilors after collecting evidence. They believed that Chen Chaohua, the director of the Tax Bureau, and Zhang Liu Xianzhi of the Civil Affairs Section, were guilty of corruption and selling positions, and should be sent to Mayor Zhang for investigation. At the same time, a document would be prepared to be sent to the Supervision Department of the Guiyang District Court, requesting them to conduct an investigation according to the law.</p>
<p>After the two bombshells were dropped, Deng, the official in charge of commercial registration in the Civil Affairs Section of the municipal government, published a "statement" in the Guizhou Daily the next day. The wording was overly serious. At the same time, he filed a lawsuit in the District Court against Speaker Chen and Councilor Xu. This "statement" added misunderstanding upon misunderstanding for the City Council. That afternoon, all the councilors unanimously decided to ask Mayor Zhang to come to the meeting in a few days to explain the matter.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 31st, the councilors arrived particularly neatly, and the number of news reporters and guests was also higher than at the previous meeting. It was a lively scene, and everyone thought that a good show was about to begin. Mayor Zhang arrived on time and calmly stated that Deng should be personally responsible for the "statement" he published. The two accusations</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Guiyang dispatch on the 19th] The "dispute between the government and the city council" that has been raging has lasted for three weeks. In this peaceful mountain city, it has stirred up ripples, which have further transformed from the intangible to the tangible, and the rapid flow of the mountain has turned into a vast flood. Both sides seem determined not to give up until they have fully contended with each other. Regarding this matter, opinions vary, and everyone has different perspectives. After the council had twice sent requests to the municipal government for investigation and to the District Court for questioning, it was decided to accept the opinions of the city council and "suspend Chen, Director, and Liu, Section Chief, pending investigation by the court." Unexpectedly, an assembly hall filled with gunpowder was extinguished with just a few words of humility and sincerity from Mayor Zhang. The second hurdle was also cleared.</p>
<p>Incident after incident</p>
<p>Problem after problem. Just when everyone thought there was peace and quiet, they knew that the dispute would be even greater. On the part of the municipal government, it was believed that although Chen and Liu had been accused of corruption and selling positions by the city council and had been asked to the District Court for questioning, the municipal government could only give Chen and Liu administrative sanctions by suspending them pending the court's investigation, which was considered the most respectful response to the public opinion organ. If the court's investigation revealed that Chen and Liu were indeed guilty, they should be dismissed and brought to justice according to the law, which they "could accept." If the court's investigation revealed that Chen and Liu were not guilty enough, then for a good civil servant who was not "every official is corrupt," they should also be protected according to the law and allowed to return to their original positions, so as not to discourage many civil servants who were striving to improve themselves. However, the city council had a different view: they believed that the evidence of corruption was conclusive and beyond doubt. Since the mayor had agreed to suspend them first, the two should resign immediately and not work in the municipal government while awaiting investigation by the court. The municipal government should prepare a document to send them over. Why was there no news for so long, forming a situation of delay? This made it too embarrassing for their public opinion organ. On the contrary, the matter of the municipal government official Deng suing Speaker Chen and Councilor Xu became more serious day by day, which made them even more suspicious. Therefore, the original eight-day session was extended indefinitely to meet every day.</p>
<p>After the council's long extension of the meeting, the two sides turned to a "cold war" phase. The news releases issued by each side seemed to be very reasonable. As a result, more than 200,000 citizens became increasingly confused about the dispute between the government and the council. Speaker Chen had to visit Chairman Gu Zhenglun to explain that the accusation was aimed at the matter and not at the person, and that there was no disagreement between the government and the council. He had to pay close attention to the municipal government's continued measures, and had visited He Chaozong, the secretary-general of the provincial government, and sent a letter to the municipal government to inquire about the progress of its implementation. Soon, the municipal government's reply came, but after the word "suspension," it added a "retention" tail, which made the council think that Mayor Zhang was joking too much, and that he was obviously insincere in fulfilling the promise he had made at the council meeting earlier. However, the municipal government's measures were purely in accordance with the "Civil Servant Appointment Law" and the "Civil Servant Attitude Regulations." They said that before the court announced the results of the investigation, it was necessary to protect councilors whose guilt was not yet determined according to the law. With such a collision, the gap between the government and the council became wider and wider, and the distance became farther and farther.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 12, the city council openly hosted gentlemen from all over the city, chairmen of various industries, and news reporters, frankly and completely presenting all the evidence collected, even the newspapers with news about the date, month, and code of relevant bills and publications, to the public, and prepared to indefinitely extend the meeting to protest, expressing that everyone was being messed with. According to Speaker Chen, who revealed shocking news in his office on the 12th, it was rumored that Mayor Zhang was now preparing to risk his official hat to fight him, meaning that either Mayor Zhang would lose his hat, or the council would be dissolved. Speaker Chen said that if Mayor Zhang really risked his official hat to fight him, the council had no position or rank, and the hospitals had no salary to pay, and it was not surprising that the hospitals would not do it. If this were the case, the "government and council as one family," which had always been harmonious, would have to declare divorce.</p>
<p>Seeing that the government and the public opinion organ were arguing, the provincial government had its own set of reasons, and similar things were not only seen in Guiyang City. In order to adapt to the needs, the provincial government announced the news of "Regulations on the Authority and Functions of County and City Governments and Councils," the general idea is in accordance with Guizhou Provincial Government's political</p>
<p>Reform Plan Provisions</p>
<p>The following points are instructed: (1) If the county and city government believes that the resolution of the county and city council is inappropriate, it should be reported to the provincial government for approval. (2) When the people petition the county and city council, the county and city councilors have no right to deal with it according to the law. (3) If the inquiry of the reporter by the county and city councilors in the meeting has reached the level of insult, they shall be liable for legal responsibility. (4) In order to take into account the facts and save expenses, the meeting period of the county and city councilors shall be changed to once every six months. (5) The county and city council shall not set up resident committees according to the law. After this single rule was stipulated, everyone understood that the farce of the government and the council had reached a climax, and the time for the curtain to fall might not be far away. Then, the</p>
<p>peace talk representatives from both sides came forward, and the third party also came out to mediate with the old method of "a toast to bury the hatchet." It is said that the solution has been quietly prepared. The two Chens and Lius who were to be suspended no longer insisted on "resigning," but changed to "taking a temporary rest" pending the court's investigation. On the one hand, they no longer insisted on "retaining their positions," but changed to appointing someone from the original senior staff of the department to "act as" the head of the department. If the results of the investigation in the future were indeed unsatisfactory, they would of course be reinstated according to the law, but for the time being, they would have to "take a temporary rest." Furthermore, the person appointed as the acting head of the department would have to meet the Qingdao council and the councilors to say that this was "giving face." In fact, this "dispute between the government and the council" was just a show on the surface, and there seemed to be a lot of news behind the scenes.</p>
<h3>Miniature News</h3>
<p>Qingpu</p>
<p>[Our report] The current traffic between Qingpu and Shanghai has been interrupted due to the closure of Hongqiao Airport. However, the vehicles transporting troops are still left in Shanghai. Qingpu only has two vehicles left. In order to maintain the livelihood of the staff, the company operates one vehicle a day, up to Wujiaxiang. The fare is one silver dollar. Passengers can go from Wujiaxiang to Qishi, and along the Caobao Highway through Caohe to Xujiahui, and enter the city. There are tricycles available. However, the military department's inspection in the middle is strict. Those who do not have a Shanghai ID card are not allowed to enter the city. Luggage should not be carried too much, otherwise it will be troublesome. Since Shanghai stipulated that residents must enter the city with an ID card, the state of fleeing in Qingpu has immediately disappeared, and the degree of panic among residents has gradually decreased. The market is said to be stable, but the price of rice has plummeted. Because wealthy families are afraid of mobs looting, they sell their stockpiled rice, so the price has fallen. There is a strange shortage of cash, and the exchange rate of silver dollars is being reduced, with no standard at all. Residents no longer have the mood to gamble, so gambling is rare, and the sound of cards is no longer heard. Elementary schools are still open as usual, but it is heard that some teachers in some schools do not go to school to avoid the disaster, leaving the students sitting idly.</p>
<p>Huangyan</p>
<p>[Our report] The whole street of Xiatangjiao, an important coastal commercial town in the southeast of Huangyan, went on strike on the 19th. The reason is that the prices of goods in various commercial stores have risen several times a day. After the goods are sold, they are purchased again, and the materials cannot offset each other, so they are closed and closed down.</p>
<p>Jinhua</p>
<p>[Our report] At 8:00 am on the 21st, the first steel beam of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, a car machine towed three tool cars to the Jinhua River Bridge, dismantled the original wooden truss beam to Ganzhou application, Jinhua River Bridge by hole modification copper beam.</p>
<p>Chongming</p>
<p>[Our report] Traffic between Shen and Chong is blocked, and people and houses are not allowed to enter or exit at will. Fortunately, it is surrounded by the sea on all sides, and only needs to be quiet as always, still maintaining the throne of "Shangri-La". Prices here have plummeted, with white rice at 250,000 yuan per dou and corn at 120,000 yuan per dou. However, the prices of imported goods have risen rapidly due to the interruption of the source. The 400,000 people on the island are unusually calm.</p>
<p>Jiading</p>
<p>[Our report] There is a strange shortage of cash here, and no one is interested in anything. However, people's hearts are stable, and all primary and secondary schools are open as usual. The transportation of rice out of the city is prohibited. The local area only needs to be good.</p>
