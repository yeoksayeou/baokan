<h3 id="c1">首都政治穿氣沉寂　李代總統昨夜返京　顏惠慶等展期明日飛平 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕首都九日竟日陰雨，氣候惡劣，原定九日自滬返京之李代總統，自穗返京之于童兩院長及自台返京之總統府秘書長翁文灝，立委程思遠等，均因為惡劣之氣候所阻，未能如期返京。九日京政治空氣沉寂與氣候同樣低沉，一般均切望滬和平代表團早日飛平，俾促成開始和談。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕李代總統九日晚十一時搭夜車返京，隨行者有黃雪邨等，黃紹竑仍留滬。代總統昨未離黃寓，惟接見往訪賓客極多，上午原定搭美齡號專憐返京，以京市氣候惡劣未果。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕總統府第二局長黃雪邨昨語記者稱：李代總統八日午出席幹部訓練班結業典禮訓話，其大意包括兩點：第一强調整飭軍風紀之重要，代總純對於軍風耙之廢弛，深感痛心，如不力求整飭，殊不能盡軍人保國衛民之天職。其次，代總統說明政府謀取和平之誠意，勗勉幹訓班學員共體時艱，克盡責任，頃開某某等報關於代總統訓話內容之記載，與事實頗多不符，如謂李代總統曾吿軍官稱：「吾人曾經不斷地談和，但共方在軍事上仍繼續攻擊吾人，吾人必須應付任何攻擊，以及李代總統曾「召開低級幹部會議」等項報道，均非事實。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕原定昨晨出發之上海和平代表團，在臨行前一剎那，因得平方通知，決改變原定計劃，延期至明日上午十時啓程。中共要求代表團延期赴平之理由，則未加說明。據甘介侯表示：前晚曾與北平方面聯絡，約定昨晨（九日）九至九時五十分問，再與平方通話一次，如一切無問題，代表團再起飛。但晟間北平電話遲至十時許始到，中共方面要求代表團延期至十一日上午十時由滬起飛赴平，屆時如氣候良好，可逕卽起飛，不必再與北平方面聯絡。按據龍華機塲之無棧電聯繫，昨晨靑島北平氣候良好，宜於飛行，故平方要求代表團延期北上，顯有其他原因。昨晨各和平代表於九時許卽照前晚之約定，集中於顏惠慶公館，靜待甘介侯氏通知後啓行，本市知名之士前往顏府送行者，亦不乏其人，至十時未得甘氏通知，均露焦慮之色，至十時二十分甘氏趕到，說明一切，並作會商後，決定延期至明日再談，惟代表之樂觀情緒，顯已遭受影響。</p>
<p>〔本報台北九日電〕翁文灝，程思遠九日午十一時半同機飛滬，浦薛鳳秘書長在機塲送行。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕程思遠氏日前應台省府陳主席電邀前往會晤，有所商談，茲已公畢，於九日下午四時乘飛機返抵滬。翁文灝同來。</p>

<h3 id="c9">鄧文儀招待記者　發表書面談話闡述和戰發展　謂國軍有把屋阻止共軍渡江 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國防部政工局長鄧文儀，昨日下午三時假軍之友社舉行記者招待會，發表「和平與戰爭的發展」書面談話，闡述「政府要和，中共要戰，北平局部和平成了騙局，及備戰以言和，能戰方能和」之旨，並答覆記者各項問題。據鄧氏判斷，共方如發動長江攻勢，至少尙需有兩個月以上之時間，蓋根據過去經驗，共軍於每次戰役以後，需要一個月時間之整補，但徐淮戰役中陳毅，劉伯承部隊損失慘重，傷亡達三分之二，觀於最近津浦南綫共軍若干部隊之北撤，必為調整補充無疑，而決非一個月以內所能完成，且雨季將臨，不利作戰，靑黃不接，軍理困難，故渠認為共軍進攻長江，至少在兩個月以後。鄧氏復聲稱，國軍有把握阻止共軍渡江。渠謂，少數共軍之偷渡，固難絕對避免，但此可立予殲滅，不致發生作用，若言大規模數十萬人之渡江，一則需要大量船隻，再則在國軍海陸空砲火集中射擊之下，必可粉碎其企圖。關於本市未來之命運，政府究擬放棄抑或作為戰塲，鄧氏拒予論述，蓋渠認為國軍可阻止共軍於長江以北。</p>
<p>鄧氏又稱：渠所發動「備戰以言和，能戰方能和」之談話，不致影響李代總統及顏惠慶等之和平努力，此項書面談話雖未呈經李代總統過目，但李代總統同意全面和平的原則。政府政策並未改變仍是謀求和平，但非北平式的局部和平，且相信不備戰無和可言。鄧氏透露何應欽氏可能去京出任某項要職，國軍並準備在江南淸鄉，以肅淸土共。又答覆記者詢問稱：南通國軍，係在一週前自動撤退。對李明揚在蘇北有所活動，是否代表政府一點，則稱無所聞。又謂：據半年以前之情報，東北共軍中有朝鮮人十四萬，日本人二萬，及某國人四萬云。（鄧氏書面談話全文刊第二版）</p>

<p>〔合衆社南京九日電〕合衆社記者九日就時事新報所傳國民黨將於三月廿九日在廣州召開中全會，以及蔣中正將以該黨總裁身份赴穗主持的消息，卽訊京中當局，但未獲證實，因此間並無對此事具有權威的官員存在，李代總統的私人顧問邱昌謂博士，或係對此事有所知悉者，渠對合衆社稱：截至目前為止，渠未聞有召開中全會的任何計劃，渠認此項消息之眞實性應屬可疑，但渠亦並未直率說明此事為不可能者。</p>
<p>此項消息雖然未經證實，但已引起京中許多人士的興趣，如中全會果然舉行，則顯將有兩種可能，（一）蔣中正將以總裁的身份，重行積極參與政治，（二）蔣氏可能再辭總裁職，要求中全會選舉新人，如此，渠將與政洽完全絕錄</p>
<p>有資格的觀察家稱：蔣氏的辭去國民黨總裁職務的可能性，遠較其重行續極參與政洽為大，據接近蔣氏的人士稱：此為蔣氏的本意，當蔣氏「引退」離京前數日，渠曾對彼等稱：渠已決定至少在以後五年中不問政治，按所謂以後五年，卽指其總統的整個六年任期而言。</p>
<p>此等觀察家稱：如蔣氏辭去國民黨總裁職務，則可能採取與其辭去總統職務的同樣方式，卽渠將暫時引退，而由中全會選舉代理總裁，至代理總裁的人選，大致亦將屬李宗仁。</p>

<p>史達林的「和平計劃」，旣未能打開美蘇間的僵局，國際間的一冷戰』，自然只有捲土重來了。我們檢討蘇聯的七項「和平計劃」，其中最重要的一項，乃在要求美國放棄大西洋安全公約；而西方各國的外交當局，則正在積極進行締結此項公約的工作，並未因史達林的和平新姿態而稍鬆弛。美國與英·法·荷·比·盧·加等七國談判公約的條款，至二月四日各項要點即達成協議，可望於三月初由各國外長簽署正式公佈；挪威·丹麥·冰島·葡萄牙·曁義大利，均將於該公約公佈前簽字參加。</p>
<p>大西洋公約的內容雖巳加重大的修正，即該公約規定全體會員國對於任何一會員國所遭受的攻擊，視為對全體會員國的攻擊，應立即對侵略國採取行動；但此項行動並不一定須以武力干涉，而可能是對侵略國或其軍隊採取外交的與經濟的制裁。此項條款的意義，不營已放賽以前規定各會員國須以軍事行動幫助友國之議，而各會員國是否參戰，可由各該國的議會自由抉擇。這個重大的修正，對於締約國的義務不作硬性規定，將使大西洋公約具有軍事同盟的作用大為减少。但是出蘇聯看來，不論大西洋公約的條款如何修改，對於蘇聯終是一大戚脅，因此不得不在外交上發動攻勢，企圖拉住北歐諸國，教她們不要參加這個大西洋公約，以减輕她直接所受的威脅。</p>
<p>蘇聯對於北歐諸或特別重視挪威的地位，故於二月五日正式向挪威建議，訂立挪蘇兩國互不侵犯條約，一則藉此以消除挪威關於蘇聯意向的一切懷疑；再則希望挪威勿加入大西洋公約，俾免西方盟國在共境內建立軍事基地。此在蘇聯照會中，說得非常明白，並率直指出西方盟國在挪戚境內建立軍事基地，「對於蘇聯最關重要，因為挪蘇兩國地域相鄰，具有共同防綫。」站在蘇聯方面的立塲，論挪蘇締結互不侵犯條約，以增强北歐的安全感，本來是題中應有之義；但是互不侵犯條約對於安全保證，究有多少作用，在國際信義蕩然無存的今日，使挪威朝野人士仍不能不有所懷疑。慶史事實是最好的教訓，蘇聯曾於一九三二年與芬蘭締結互不侵犯條約，但至一九三八年蘇聯即不顧此，神聖的條約，公然命令紅軍侵入芬蘭境內。又德國曾於九三九年興蘇聯訂立互不侵犯條約，但時隔未久，德軍却又移師東征攻入蘇聯境內了。略舉一二實例，即不難證明互不侵犯條約早已是一個宣吿破產的外交政策，今後自更少其價值了。</p>
<p>現在，挪威究竟參加大西洋公約抑或與蘇聯訂立互不侵犯條約，尙在舉棋不定之中，據挪京政界人士談稱，在原則上並不反對與蘇聯締結互不侵犯條約，祖以地理形勢而論，挪威是屬於大西洋方面的，一切還要等待外長蘭琪返國後決定，從其語氣看來，顯然也傾向大西洋公約。何况蘭琪外長對於參加大西洋公約早已明朗的表示，他在赴美之前，曾向挪威議會表示：（一）挪威若無外援，則永遠無力制止任何强國向其進攻，或予打擊者以還擊；（二）吾人需要輪入軍事設備，始能建立防禦工程。當他抵美之後，他又說此行目的，乃在詢問美國務院，如果挪威參加大西洋公約即可以得到怎樣的安全保證。假如他能獲得美國務院的切實保證，挪威決定參加大西洋公約，是沒有問題的。挪威旣走這條路，其他北歐諸國除了在鐵幕之內的芬蘭而外，瑞典和丹麥的參加大西洋公約，也是必然的趨勢了。</p>

<p>（一）政府要和：政府鑒於國內運年戰亂，民不聊生，自蔣總統於今年元旦發表文吿，提出五項代表全國民意的條款以來，在過去四十天中，曾不斷眞心誠意的要求和平，如行政院決議無條件停戰，指派代表進行和談，蔣總統的引退，李代總統為表示誠意與決心，決定很多促進和平的措施，並邀請人民代表前往北平與共黨初步洽談，致電毛澤東，促其早日派還代表，商定地點，實施和談·不過政府要和也有三項原則，卽是要平等的和平，全面的和平，有條件的和平，如果違背這些原則，和平便是假的，也是無法實現的。在軍事方面，政府不斷的撤退接近共軍防綫的部隊，北平方面的國軍早經停戰，並撤離北平，華東方面除長江北岸幾個橋頭堡外，國軍幾已完全退，這一連串的表示，任何人都可以看出政府是誠心誠意的在蔪求和平。</p>
<p>（二）中共要戰：中共元且前的廣播，要使「戰爭進行到底」。一月五日由新華社廣播，對於總統文吿極端反對，並加以無比的調侃和抨擊。一月十四日，毛澤東提出恢復和談的八項條件，申明之後，對其指戰員指示，對政府軍要「堅決澈底乾凈元全殲滅之。」二十一日。二十五日，復先後發表廣播，堅持先懲辦「戰犯」然後才能和談·至二十八·二十九兩日，又復發表冗長廣播，節外生枝，不但要先行逮捕所謂「國內戰犯」，而且要懲辦日本戰爭罪犯，作為和談的先決條件，其中不少地方，充滿盛氣凌人及潑婦駡街之姿態，如「淸一淸，算一算，鬥一鬥，爭一爭，」及「有權命令你們」等等，其好戰心情及無和平誠意，雖三尺童子亦不致為其騙過。本月七日，共方廣播表示拒絕政府代表赴平，並諷刺邵力子。甘介侯代表為和平販子為和平揗客。同時行動方面的表現，在政府軍隊撤退地區，共方卽節節進佔，處處攻擊，絕不使有絲毫空隙地區，以作雙方和談進程中之緩衝地帶。在我後方的謠言攻勢，政治攻勢，也變本加厲，無孔不入。凡此種種，都足證明共黨亳無和平誠意，且在積極部署更大規模的全面性的戰爭，企國進犯長江沿綫，尤其是京滬武漢地區，陷我江南億萬同胞於水深火熱的戰亂氣氛中而後快·</p>
<p>（三）北平局部和平成了騙局：中共為减少損失，以完成他統制中國的迷夢計，一月來不斷的在各地擺佈局部和平的騙局。最近從北平逃出的人，和各地報紙的報導，我們不難看出北平在局部和談協定公布後，一切都已陷於鐵幕的籠罩中，如共黨天天叫着的什麼民主，什麼自由，今天在北平各處所表現的，是到處捕人，到處搜查，毫不民主，毫不自由。就是局部與談時雙方所同意的條款，共黨也沒有一條是實行的，甚至連起碼的聯合辦事處，也沒有好好組成，而由共黨指派葉劍英為市長，主持一切市政，同時成立軍事管制委員會，動輒以「國特」「戰犯」名義，對成千成萬的人加以逮捕處置。對事前商定保障國軍安全的問題，現在共黨却把留平的國軍壓迫分向北平四郊，分駐若干地點，由共軍各個包眞，分派政委，逼走高級軍官，脅迫官兵改編，限制糧食水源，使廿萬國軍陷於求生不得求死不能的絕境，而且廣播說，己把我傳作義將軍以華北頭號戰犯名義，加以看管，使無絲壹百由。這種人民生活毫無自由，軍隊毫無保障的所謂局部和平，完全是陰險惡毒的騙局，也是一個嚴重的事實教訓，證明中共宣傳機關鼓吹的所謂進行局部和平，向北平看齊，是完全要不得，而且是不可能的。全國軍民受了一回欺騙，是不會再受騙的。</p>
<p>（四）備戰以言和，能戰方能和：在中共使戰爭進行到底，企圖進犯長江，置政府和談誠意於不顧的今日，政府除仍本和平的方針，力求和平之外，鑒於北平局部騙局之可怕，為求得平等的，全面的，有條件的眞正和平，政府唯有積極備戰，始能言和，亦唯有「能戰始能和」。目前我國軍將士，對此咸能深切認識，尤其是長江防守部隊，士氣極為旺盛，全體官兵莫不憤慨萬分，誓與中共決一死戰。加以長江天險，海陸空軍協同作戰，敵人絕不容易將其主力飛渡長江，沿岸的進攻退守，國軍業已取得主動，準備充分，不會同濟南·藩陽·長春·錦州·平津等地一樣，陷於孤立無援的苦境，共軍如欲强渡長江，必遭覆沒中流之慘敗。此外，大江以南各省市人民，有見於共黨對和平毫無誠意，尤其是局部和談驅同之可怖興可恥，已普遍激起憤怒，咸起組織自衛，協助國軍，支援前綫，如共黨仍不收歛其窮兵廳武之心，則我政府雖極力倡導和平，促進和平，希望全面和平早日實現，但全國軍民為了保障生命財產之安全與自由，幷不惜犧牲一切，與共黨周旋到底，直至共黨覺悟停戰，以至眞正和平實現而後已。</p>

<h3 id="c43">四強重開對奧和約談判　蘇支持南領士要求　美國堅決拒絕修改奧疆界 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦九日電〕美英法蘇四國外長代表今日在此問倫凱斯特大厦揭幕，對起草奧地利和約作第三次嘗試。蘇聯代表立卽提議由該會聰取南斯拉夫對於奧地利之領土要求，南斯拉夫一向要求奧國劃讓卡林西亞省大部份。此次外長代表會議將給予史達林總理說明其和平言論是否與行動相符之機會。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播：四强外次本日召開會議時，蘇聯支持南斯拉夫對奧提出領土要求。此項會議之佈置，原爲希望狄托與蘇聯及其他共產國際情報局國家間之爭執可以轉變形勢，但四國外次於休會九個月以後重行會談時，東西間之磨擦重又發生。會議開始後一小時內，似又回復去年五月六日閉會時之情勢。會議無結果而宣吿休會，卽最初之議程問題亦未解決。美代表李培爾抨擊蘇聯之建議稱，此時再提出南斯拉夫要求，毫無用處，因美國不擬再考慮改變奧國疆界。此外，蘇聯更建議將四强保證奧國彊界一點，訂入對奧和約中。李氏謂仍需要對奧有一般的保證，但願意捨棄奧國受威脅時應召集四强會談之條文。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦九日電〕當四强再度開始談判對奧和約之際，西方國家九日迫蘇聯表示有妥協精神。美英法蘇四國代表頃舉行秘密會議，圖克服三年來阻礙對奧和約之爭執。西方國家代表事先警吿稱，彼等並無新建議提出，但彼等安排讓蘇聯發表一般開塲白，表示蘇聯準備妥約與否。東西間在全世界拮抗方面均有爭執，但雙方面均承認最有危險性之糾紛，至於奧國與南斯拉夫之疆界問題。以前和約談判所以決裂者卽在於此。蘇聯曾堅持奧國應以七二八方哩土地割讓予南國，西方國家拒絕此議，四强遂於去年五月六日中斷締給和約之圖。在本日會議開始時，美代表李培爾稱，美國決不接受南斯拉夫之領土要求，除非蘇聯在此一問題上讓步，協議似亳無希望。但蘇聯諒將暫時堅持領土問題，作為討價還價之工具。在對奧和約草案中之十八點爭執，包括對奧國獨立之可能保證，處置流亡人民，次要軍事條款，以及奧國向蘇聯及南斯拉夫之賠償等等。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕杜魯門總統對目前國際局勢，較數月前更抱樂觀。此項希望並非基於任何特殊的最近發展，而大部份係由於馬歇爾計劃及歐洲鐵幕外的國家內漸進的成功。總統此項樂觀態度，係由其最接近的被諮詢的人士所表現，總統認為，沒有戰爭的日子，卽為和平的一天。據總統的機密顧問之一稱，渠認為時間的因素與美國有利，世界上沒有爆發戰爭的時期愈長，戰爭爆發的機會亦將愈少。</p>
<p>關於最近蘇聯壓迫挪威的一類事件，渠認為蘇聯係示意而非威脅，某消息靈通人士稱，「渠（指社魯門）從未因史達林「和平攻勢」而上當，渠在開始時卽已看出此顯然為一種宣傳攻勢，蘇聯人士從未對渠談及與史達林會談事。」</p>
<p>犠牲政治收穫避免世界戰爭</p>
<p>總統所發表的談話，從未有較其一再重申的「我所希望的一切，就是世界上的和平」更為誠懇。熟知總統多年的人士稱，渠將為避免世界戰爭而願意犧牲任何國內的政治收穫。總統在每日淸晟自政府情報官員處，獲悉最近的世界發展的極度秘密的摘要。杜魯門為極度的樂觀主義者，渠深知目前局勢的微妙，但渠認為曾獲得美國經濟援助的國家的人民均屬親美，渠並堅決認為聯合國必須成功。渠並認為世界大部份人民相信渠宣佈的「美國並無領土及帝國主義者的野心，而所希望的確係一切人類的自由平等及獨立」的聲明。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕鐵路工潮至前晚暫吿段落，客車於午夜恢復開出後，前日由京杭兩地來滬被阻於各站之客車，於昨日上午亦已陸續抵滬。同時有客車十三列離滬駛往京杭。及至下午二時，又起波折，龍頭房及工務處工人邀合運務處及北站職員全體停工赴管理局請願，於是兩綫交通於二時起再吿停頓。經多方調解，工潮於五時一刻平息，六時復工，應於今晨開出之各次車，於六時以後相繼駛出，今日起兩綫客車可望逐漸恢復正常。</p>
<p>昨日上午，一部份工人雖照常工作，然另一部份工人則集合於工人俱樂部，商討及計劃繼續爭取待遇事宜。及至下午二時，計劃成熟，大隊工人沿軌道至北站及北站大樓，邀合站上及大樓中員工全體停工，同赴管理局請願。一時聲勢甚壯，請願員工總數在一千人以上。王局長派警務處處長錢鶴皋，專員張雲鶴二人與工人羣衆接洽，工人提出新要求五項：（一）前日受傷工人王忠卿，由路局賠償醫藥費食米一百石。（二）保證以後不發生同樣事件。（三）保障工人安全。（四）調整房貼（現為每月五元）。（五）援去年底局方發給處長銀元五十元，科長二十元之例，員工亦應普發銀元。雙方正折衝磋商未決時，警備部開到大批士兵，羣衆立起鼓噪，認為當局採高壓手段，甚表不滿。幸經稽查處長何龍慶解釋，並保證此項兵士僅來維持秩序，不干涉其他事項，羣衆情緒始稍緩和。王局長並請何處長參加作調人，最後得協議四點：（一）今日先發食米每人二斗。（二）待遇問題，於明日（十一日）自動調整運價實行後，擬定具體計劃，於十四日公布。（三）房貼銀元等項併入待遇問題中一併解決。（四）王忠卿受傷，由局方負責醫治。醫務處錢處長並向王忠卿致慰問之意。員工認為滿意，欣然退去，立卽恢復工作，靜待十四日調整待遇辦法之公布。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The capital experienced a day of continuous rain on the 9th, with inclement weather.  Acting President Li, originally scheduled to return to Beijing from Shanghai on the 9th, as well as the two Yuan Presidents Yu and Tong returning from Guangzhou, and Presidential Secretary-General Weng Wenhao and legislator Cheng Siyuan returning from Taiwan, were all prevented from returning as scheduled due to the adverse weather conditions. The political atmosphere in Beijing on the 9th was as沉寂 and depressing as the weather.  Everyone earnestly hoped that the Shanghai peace delegation would fly to Beiping as soon as possible to facilitate the start of peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Acting President Li boarded a night train to return to Beijing at 11:00 PM on the 9th, accompanied by Huang Xuecun and others. Huang Shaohong remained in Shanghai. The Acting President did not leave the Huang residence yesterday, but received a large number of visiting guests. He was originally scheduled to return to Beijing on the "Meiling" special plane in the morning, but was unsuccessful due to the adverse weather conditions in Beijing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Huang Xuecun, Director of the Second Bureau of the Presidential Office, told reporters yesterday that Acting President Li attended the graduation ceremony of the cadre training class on the afternoon of the 8th and gave a speech, the main points of which included two aspects: First, he emphasized the importance of rectifying military discipline. The Acting President felt deeply saddened by the laxity of military discipline. If efforts are not made to rectify it, the military cannot fulfill its duty to protect the country and its people. Second, the Acting President explained the government's sincerity in seeking peace, urging the trainees of the cadre training class to share the difficulties and fulfill their responsibilities. The reports in certain newspapers regarding the content of the Acting President's speech contain many inaccuracies, such as the statement that Acting President Li told military officers: "We have been constantly seeking peace, but the Communist Party continues to attack us militarily. We must respond to any attacks," and that Acting President Li "convened a meeting of lower-level cadres," are all untrue.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai peace delegation, originally scheduled to depart yesterday morning, decided to change its original plan and postpone its departure to 10:00 AM tomorrow upon receiving a notice from Beiping at the last moment. The reason given by the CCP for requesting the delegation's postponement to Beiping was not explained. According to Gan Jiehou: He had contacted Beiping the night before, agreeing to speak to Beiping again between 9:00 AM and 9:50 AM yesterday (the 9th). If everything was in order, the delegation would then take off. However, the Beiping telephone call did not arrive until after 10:00 AM. The CCP side requested the delegation to postpone its departure from Shanghai to Beiping until 10:00 AM on the morning of the 11th. If the weather is good at that time, they can take off directly without contacting Beiping again. According to the wireless communication from Longhua Airport, the weather in Qingdao and Beiping was good for flying yesterday morning. Therefore, there must be other reasons why Beiping requested the delegation to postpone its trip north. Yesterday morning, all the peace delegates gathered at Yan Huiqing's residence around 9:00 AM as agreed the night before, waiting quietly for Gan Jiehou's notification before departing. Many well-known figures in the city also went to Yan's residence to see them off. When they did not receive Gan's notification by 10:00 AM, they all showed anxious expressions. Gan arrived at 10:20 AM, explained everything, and after consultation, it was decided to postpone the discussion until tomorrow. However, the delegates' optimistic mood was clearly affected.</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 9th] Weng Wenhao and Cheng Siyuan flew to Shanghai together at 11:30 AM on the 9th. Secretary-General Pu Xuefeng saw them off at the airport.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Cheng Siyuan was invited by Chairman Chen of the Taiwan Provincial Government to meet with him some days ago to discuss matters. Having completed his public duties, he returned to Shanghai by plane at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th. Weng Wenhao came with him.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Deng Wenyi Holds Press Conference, Issues Written Statement Elaborating on the Development of Peace and War, Saying the National Army is Confident of Preventing the Communist Army from Crossing the River <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, held a press conference at the Military Friends Society at 3:00 PM yesterday, issuing a written statement on "The Development of Peace and War," elaborating on the principles of "the government wants peace, the CCP wants war, the partial peace in Beiping is a deception, and preparing for war to seek peace, and being able to fight is the only way to achieve peace." He also answered various questions from reporters. According to Deng's judgment, it will take at least two months or more for the Communist Party to launch an offensive across the Yangtze River. Based on past experience, the Communist army needs a month to reorganize and replenish after each battle. However, the Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng troops suffered heavy losses in the Xuzhou-Huaihai Campaign, with casualties reaching two-thirds. Observing the recent northward withdrawal of some Communist troops on the Jinpu Southern Line, it is undoubtedly for adjustment and replenishment, which cannot be completed within a month. Moreover, the rainy season is approaching, which is unfavorable for combat, and there is a shortage of supplies, making military logistics difficult. Therefore, he believes that the Communist army's attack on the Yangtze River will be at least two months away. Deng also claimed that the National Army is confident of preventing the Communist army from crossing the river. He said that it is difficult to completely avoid a few Communist troops from crossing the river by stealth, but they can be annihilated immediately and will not have an impact. As for a large-scale crossing of the river by hundreds of thousands of people, it would require a large number of ships. Furthermore, under the concentrated fire of the National Army's naval, land, and air artillery, their attempt can be shattered. Regarding the future fate of the city, whether the government intends to abandon it or use it as a battlefield, Deng refused to discuss it, believing that the National Army can prevent the Communist army north of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Deng also said that his speech on "preparing for war to seek peace, and being able to fight is the only way to achieve peace" will not affect the peace efforts of Acting President Li and Yan Huiqing. Although this written statement has not been reviewed by Acting President Li, Acting President Li agrees with the principle of comprehensive peace. The government's policy has not changed and it is still seeking peace, but not the partial peace of the Beiping type, and it believes that there can be no peace without preparation for war. Deng revealed that He Yingqin may go to Beijing to assume a certain important position, and the National Army is preparing to carry out a "cleansing campaign" in Jiangnan to eliminate local communists. In response to reporters' inquiries, he said that the National Army in Nantong had automatically withdrawn a week ago. As to whether Li Mingyang's activities in northern Jiangsu represent the government, he said he had no knowledge of it. He also said that according to information from half a year ago, there were 140,000 Koreans, 20,000 Japanese, and 40,000 people of a certain country in the Northeast Communist Army.

<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] Military News: The Communist troops harassing the Dangyang and Jingmen areas in central Hubei have been forced to move north after reinforcements from the National Army blocked them in recent days. The periphery of Yichang and Shashi is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] The General剿匪 Headquarters announced: At the beginning of this month, the main force of the Communist Jianghan Column and the Tenth Column, along with approximately 20,000 local communists near Jingmen, launched an attack on Jingmen. In order to concentrate forces to strike the Communist troops, the National Army voluntarily abandoned Jingmen on the 5th.

<h3 id="e31">Report of a Plenary Session to be Held in Guangzhou on March 29th Not Confirmed in Beijing <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] A United Press reporter inquired with the authorities in Beijing on the 9th regarding the report in the Shibao Times that the Kuomintang will hold a plenary session in Guangzhou on March 29th, and that Chiang Kai-shek will go to Guangzhou in his capacity as the party's Director-General to preside over the session. However, it was not confirmed. Since there are no officials with authority on this matter in Beijing, Dr. Qiu Changwei, a private advisor to Acting President Li, may have been aware of the matter. He told United Press that, as of now, he has not heard of any plans to convene a plenary session. He believes that the truthfulness of this report is doubtful, but he did not directly say that it was impossible.</p>
<p>Although this report has not been confirmed, it has aroused the interest of many people in Beijing. If the plenary session is indeed held, then there will be two possibilities: (1) Chiang Kai-shek will actively participate in politics again in his capacity as Director-General, or (2) Chiang may resign as Director-General again, requesting the plenary session to elect a new person. In this case, he will be completely disconnected from political affairs.</p>
<p>Qualified observers say that the possibility of Chiang resigning as Director-General of the Kuomintang is far greater than his actively participating in politics again. According to people close to Chiang, this is Chiang's intention. A few days before Chiang "retired" from Beijing, he told them that he had decided not to be involved in politics for at least the next five years. The so-called next five years refers to his entire six-year term as president.</p>
<p>These observers say that if Chiang resigns as Director-General of the Kuomintang, he may take the same approach as when he resigned as president, that is, he will temporarily retire, and the plenary session will elect an Acting Director-General. As for the candidate for Acting Director-General, it will likely be Li Zongren.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Representatives of the Southern Baptist Convention stationed abroad are meeting here to discuss the impact of the spread of communism on church activities. According to Williams, former treasurer of the Convention stationed in China, told reporters today: "Foreign churches in China may have to temporarily withdraw from the areas occupied by the CCP, but will find ways to return in the future. Before the war, the Southern Baptist Convention had more than 200 staff members working in China. Currently, there are only more than 160 people. Staff in Shandong and Henan have been evacuated, and the fate of the church's property in those areas is uncertain. Church work is proceeding smoothly in East and South China."</p>

<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 9th] West Coast importers and exporters are preparing to trade with the Chinese Communist regime. This was revealed in a United Press survey of the opinions of merchants in this traditional "gateway to the East." If the CCP government decides to erect a "curtain" around the Chinese economy, the United States is likely to lose all or part of its approximately $400 million in trade with China, out of a total annual trade with the East of $1 billion. However, these importers and exporters, and other merchants, do not believe that the CCP plans to cut off trade with the United States. They point out that the CCP has recently adopted a "moderate" attitude towards foreigners in the North Chinese cities it has conquered.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Atlantic Treaty and Soviet-Norwegian Non-Aggression <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Stalin's "peace plan" having failed to break the deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union, a "cold war" in the international arena naturally only returned with renewed force. Reviewing the Soviet Union's seven "peace plans," the most important was the demand that the United States abandon the Atlantic Security Pact; while the diplomatic authorities of Western countries were actively working to conclude this pact, without relaxing their efforts due to Stalin's new peace posture. The United States and seven other countries, including the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Canada, reached an agreement on the key points of the treaty terms on February 4th, and it is expected that the foreign ministers of each country will sign and officially announce it in early March; Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Portugal, and Italy will all sign and join the pact before its announcement.</p>
<p>Although the content of the Atlantic Treaty has undergone significant revisions, stipulating that an attack on any member state will be regarded as an attack on all member states, requiring immediate action against the aggressor; this action does not necessarily require military intervention, but could be diplomatic or economic sanctions against the aggressor or its military. The significance of this provision is that the previous requirement for each member state to help friendly countries with military action has been abandoned, and whether each member state participates in the war can be freely decided by the country's parliament. This major revision, by not making the obligations of the contracting states mandatory, will greatly reduce the role of the Atlantic Treaty as a military alliance. However, from the Soviet Union's point of view, no matter how the terms of the Atlantic Treaty are revised, it is ultimately a major threat to the Soviet Union, and therefore it has to launch a diplomatic offensive, trying to hold back the Nordic countries, teaching them not to join this Atlantic Treaty, to reduce the direct threat it faces.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union attaches particular importance to Norway's position among the Nordic countries, and therefore formally proposed to Norway on February 5th the conclusion of a Soviet-Norwegian non-aggression treaty, partly to dispel all of Norway's doubts about the Soviet Union's intentions; and partly to hope that Norway would not join the Atlantic Treaty, so as to prevent Western allies from establishing military bases on its territory. This is stated very clearly in the Soviet note, which bluntly points out that the establishment of military bases by Western allies on Norwegian territory "is of utmost importance to the Soviet Union, because Norway and the Soviet Union are geographically adjacent and have a common defense line." From the Soviet Union's perspective, it is natural to discuss the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between Norway and the Soviet Union to enhance the sense of security in Northern Europe; however, in today's world where international credibility is non-existent, the Norwegians cannot help but have doubts about the extent to which a non-aggression treaty can guarantee security. Historical facts are the best lesson: the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression treaty with Finland in 1932, but by 1938 the Soviet Union disregarded this sacred treaty and openly ordered the Red Army to invade Finnish territory. Furthermore, Germany concluded a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in 1939, but not long after, German troops shifted eastward and attacked Soviet territory. A few examples are enough to prove that the non-aggression treaty has long been a bankrupt diplomatic policy, and its value will be even less in the future.</p>
<p>Currently, Norway is still undecided whether to join the Atlantic Treaty or conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. According to political figures in Oslo, they do not oppose concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in principle, but in terms of geographical location, Norway belongs to the Atlantic, and everything will have to wait until Foreign Minister Lange returns home to decide. Judging from his tone, he is clearly leaning towards the Atlantic Treaty. Moreover, Foreign Minister Lange has already made clear his stance on joining the Atlantic Treaty. Before going to the United States, he told the Norwegian Parliament: (1) If Norway does not have external support, it will never be able to stop any strong country from attacking it, or retaliate against the attacker; (2) We need to import military equipment in order to build defense works. After arriving in the United States, he also said that the purpose of his trip was to ask the U.S. State Department what kind of security guarantees Norway could get if it joined the Atlantic Treaty. If he can obtain a firm guarantee from the U.S. State Department, there is no question that Norway will decide to join the Atlantic Treaty. Once Norway takes this path, the participation of Sweden and Denmark in the Atlantic Treaty, apart from Finland which is within the Iron Curtain, is also an inevitable trend.</p>

Tao Kainan, the U.S. naval attaché here, and Sen Sheng, the director of the South China Office of the Administration, went to the airport to greet them. The purpose of Lai's trip was to say goodbye to President Sun, as Lai has been summoned to return to the United States before the 16th. President Sun will host a banquet for Lai on the 10th at noon, and Lai will visit Guangdong Chairman Xue Yue in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 9th] Lai Puhan, Director of the China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration, arrived here today to discuss aid to South China with Chinese and American officials. He is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 12th and then return to his country with his family on the 16th to report on his work.</p>
<p>[Our City News] A joint meeting of the Executive Yuan's U.S. Aid Utilization Committee and the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration is scheduled to be held in Guangzhou on the 10th. President Sun, Chairman of the U.S. Aid Committee, all committee members, and Secretary-General Shen Xirui have arrived in Guangzhou ahead of schedule.

<p>[United Press, Beiping, 9th] The Beiping Office of the China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration is currently in a dilemma. The office was originally scheduled to close on the 4th and evacuate all personnel who wished to leave Beiping by air, but Director Davis has so far been unable to contact the Communists, making it impossible to obtain permission for the plane to land. He only indirectly learned that the Communists would not allow planes from anti-communist areas to come to Beiping, except for planes carrying peace delegations. Although the office hopes to use the planes carrying drugs for Xiehe Hospital to evacuate personnel, this is almost impossible unless the Communists change their position. There are currently about 100,000 tons of flour in the office that have not been distributed, and the Communists do not seem to allow it to be moved. The vehicles parked in the office square have been strictly inspected by the Communist army. It is reported that all vehicles must be registered, and the office immediately sent personnel to run around, only to learn that this registration is limited to Chinese vehicles.

<h3 id="e60">The Development of Peace and War, Deng Wenyu Published the Full Text of His Written Statement <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Government Wants Peace: In view of the years of war in the country and the people's livelihood, since President Chiang issued a statement on New Year's Day this year and put forward five articles representing the national public opinion, in the past forty days, he has constantly and sincerely demanded peace, such as the Executive Yuan's resolution to unconditionally cease fire, appointing representatives to conduct peace talks, President Chiang's resignation, and Vice President Li's decision to take many measures to promote peace to show his sincerity and determination, and inviting people's representatives to go to Beiping to have preliminary talks with the Communist Party, and telegraphing Mao Zedong to urge him to send representatives back as soon as possible to discuss the location and implement peace talks. However, the government's desire for peace also has three principles, namely, equal peace, comprehensive peace, and conditional peace. If these principles are violated, peace will be false and impossible to achieve. In the military aspect, the government has continuously withdrawn troops close to the Communist army's defense line. The National Army in Beiping has long ceased fire and withdrawn from Beiping. In East China, except for a few bridgeheads on the north bank of the Yangtze River, the National Army has almost completely withdrawn. This series of expressions can be seen by anyone that the government is sincerely seeking peace.</p>
<p>(2) The CCP Wants War: The CCP's broadcasts before New Year's Day called for "carrying out the war to the end." On January 5, Xinhua News Agency broadcasted that it strongly opposed the President's statement and ridiculed and criticized it incomparably. On January 14, Mao Zedong put forward eight conditions for resuming peace talks, and after stating them, he instructed his commanders and soldiers to "resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate" the government army. On the 21st and 25th, he repeatedly issued broadcasts, insisting on punishing the "war criminals" before peace talks could be held. On the 28th and 29th, he issued lengthy broadcasts, adding unnecessary complications, not only demanding the arrest of the so-called "domestic war criminals" first, but also demanding the punishment of Japanese war criminals as a prerequisite for peace talks. Many places were full of arrogance and shrewish scolding, such as "clear it up, calculate it, fight it, fight for it," and "have the right to order you," etc. His warmongering mood and lack of sincerity for peace, even a three-foot-tall child would not be deceived by him. On the 7th of this month, the Communist Party broadcast that it refused the government representatives to go to Ping, and satirized Shao Lizi and Gan Jihou as peace peddlers and peace wanderers. At the same time, in terms of actions, the Communist Party immediately occupied every inch of the area where the government troops withdrew, attacking everywhere, and never allowing any gap area to be used as a buffer zone in the process of peace talks between the two sides. The rumor offensive and political offensive in our rear have also intensified and become pervasive. All of these are enough to prove that the Communist Party has no sincerity for peace and is actively deploying a larger-scale, comprehensive war, attempting to invade the Yangtze River coastline, especially the Beijing-Shanghai-Wuhan area, and plunging hundreds of millions of our compatriots in Jiangnan into the atmosphere of war and chaos.</p>
<p>(3) The Partial Peace in Beiping Has Become a Scam: In order to reduce losses and complete his dream of dominating China, the CCP has been arranging local peace scams in various places for the past month. From the people who recently escaped from Beiping and the reports of newspapers in various places, we can easily see that after the announcement of the local peace agreement in Beiping, everything has fallen into the shroud of the Iron Curtain. For example, what the Communist Party has been shouting about every day, such as democracy and freedom, what is being shown everywhere in Beiping today is arresting people everywhere, searching everywhere, without any democracy or freedom. Even the terms agreed upon by both sides during the partial talks, the Communist Party has not implemented any of them, and even the minimum joint office has not been properly formed. Instead, Ye Jianying was appointed as the mayor by the Communist Party to preside over all municipal affairs, and a military control committee was established, and thousands of people were arrested and dealt with in the name of "national special agents" and "war criminals." Regarding the issue of guaranteeing the safety of the National Army, which was agreed upon in advance, the Communist Party is now oppressing the National Army stationed in Ping, dividing them into several locations in the four suburbs of Beiping, and stationing them in various places, with the Communist Army individually responsible for the truth, assigning political commissars, forcing senior military officers to leave, coercing officers and soldiers to reorganize, and restricting food and water sources, making the 200,000 National Army trapped in a desperate situation where they cannot live or die. Moreover, it was broadcast that he had been referred to as General Yi and placed under guard in the name of the number one war criminal in North China, so that there was no one hundred percent guarantee. This so-called partial peace, where the people's lives have no freedom and the army has no guarantee, is a completely sinister and vicious scam, and a serious lesson of fact. It proves that the so-called promotion of partial peace and learning from Beiping, which is touted by the CCP's propaganda machine, is completely unacceptable and impossible. The military and civilians of the country have been deceived once and will not be deceived again.</p>
<p>(4) Preparing for War to Speak of Peace, Only by Being Able to Fight Can We Have Peace: Today, when the CCP is carrying out the war to the end and attempting to invade the Yangtze River, ignoring the government's sincerity in peace talks, in addition to adhering to the policy of peace and striving for peace, the government, in view of the terrible nature of the local scam in Beiping, in order to obtain a true peace that is equal, comprehensive, and conditional, the government can only actively prepare for war in order to speak of peace, and only by "being able to fight can we have peace." At present, the military officers and soldiers of our country are deeply aware of this, especially the Yangtze River defense troops. The morale is extremely high, and all officers and soldiers are indignant and vow to fight the CCP to the death. In addition, the Yangtze River is a natural barrier, and the army, navy, and air force cooperate in combat. It is extremely difficult for the enemy to fly across the Yangtze River with its main force. The National Army has taken the initiative in the offensive and defensive along the coast and is fully prepared. It will not fall into the same isolated and helpless situation as Jinan, Fanyang, Changchun, Jinzhou, Pingjin, and other places. If the Communist Army wants to force its way across the Yangtze River, it will suffer a tragic defeat in the middle of the river. In addition, the people in the provinces and cities south of the Yangtze River, seeing that the Communist Party has no sincerity for peace, especially the terrible and shameful nature of local peace talks, have generally aroused anger and have risen to organize self-defense, assist the National Army, and support the front line. If the Communist Party still does not restrain its heart of exhaustion and military force, then our government, while vigorously advocating peace and promoting peace, and hoping for the early realization of comprehensive peace, will not hesitate to sacrifice everything to protect the safety and freedom of life and property of the military and civilians of the country, and will deal with the Communist Party to the end, until the Communist Party realizes to cease fire and achieve true peace.</p>

<h3 id="e61">The Four Powers Reopen Negotiations on the Austrian State Treaty; Soviet Union Supports Yugoslavia's Territorial Demands; United States Firmly Rejects Modifying Austrian Borders <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[United Press London, 9th] The foreign ministers' representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union inaugurated their third attempt to draft the Austrian State Treaty today at Lancaster House in London. Soviet representative immediately proposed that the conference adopt Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Austria, which has consistently requested Austria to cede a large part of the province of Carinthia. This meeting of the foreign ministers' representatives will give Premier Stalin an opportunity to demonstrate whether his peaceful rhetoric aligns with his actions.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, 9th Broadcast: When the four powers' deputies met today, the Soviet Union supported Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Austria. The arrangement of this meeting was originally intended to allow the dispute between Tito and the Soviet Union and other Cominform countries to shift the situation, but when the four powers' deputies reconvened after a nine-month recess, friction between the East and West re-emerged. Within an hour of the meeting's commencement, it seemed to revert to the situation when it adjourned on May 6th of last year. The meeting adjourned without result, and even the initial agenda issue was not resolved. U.S. representative Reber criticized the Soviet Union's proposal, saying that it was useless to raise Yugoslavia's demands again, as the United States did not intend to consider changing Austria's borders again. In addition, the Soviet Union also suggested incorporating into the Austrian State Treaty the point that the four powers guarantee Austria's borders. Reber said that a general guarantee for Austria was still needed, but he was willing to abandon the clause that the four powers should convene a meeting when Austria was threatened.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 9th] As the four powers began negotiations on the Austrian State Treaty again, Western countries urged the Soviet Union on the 9th to show a spirit of compromise. The representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union recently held a closed-door meeting to overcome the disputes that have hindered the Austrian State Treaty for three years. Western representatives warned in advance that they had no new proposals to make, but they arranged for the Soviet Union to make a general opening statement, indicating whether the Soviet Union was prepared to compromise. There are disputes between the East and the West in all aspects of global contention, but both sides acknowledge that the most dangerous conflict concerns the border issue between Austria and Yugoslavia. The previous treaty negotiations broke down on this point. The Soviet Union had insisted that Austria should cede 728 square miles of land to Yugoslavia, but the Western countries rejected this proposal, and the four powers interrupted their efforts to conclude the treaty on May 6th of last year. At the beginning of today's meeting, U.S. representative Reber said that the United States would never accept Yugoslavia's territorial demands, and unless the Soviet Union gave way on this issue, an agreement seemed hopeless. However, the Soviet Union will probably insist on the territorial issue for the time being as a bargaining tool. The 18 points of contention in the draft Austrian State Treaty include possible guarantees for Austria's independence, the disposition of displaced persons, minor military clauses, and Austria's reparations to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Marshall Plan Achieves Significant Success; Truman Expresses Optimism; Believes the Factor of Time Favors the United States <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 9th] President Truman is more optimistic about the current international situation than he was a few months ago. This hope is not based on any particular recent developments, but mostly on the gradual success of the Marshall Plan and the countries outside the Iron Curtain in Europe. This optimistic attitude of the President is expressed by his closest advisors. The President believes that any day without war is a day of peace. According to one of the President's confidential advisors, he believes that the factor of time favors the United States, and the longer the world goes without war, the less likely war is to break out.</p>
<p>Regarding recent incidents such as the Soviet Union's oppression of Norway, he believes that the Soviet Union is signaling rather than threatening. A well-informed source said, "He (referring to Truman) was never fooled by Stalin's 'peace offensive.' He saw from the beginning that this was clearly a propaganda offensive. Soviet officials never spoke to him about meeting with Stalin."</p>
<p>Sacrificing Political Gains to Avoid World War</p>
<p>No statement made by the President has been more sincere than his repeated affirmation that "all I hope for is peace in the world." People who have known the President for many years say that he would be willing to sacrifice any domestic political gain to avoid a world war. The President receives a highly confidential summary of the latest world developments from government intelligence officials every morning. Truman is an extreme optimist. He is well aware of the delicacy of the current situation, but he believes that the people of the countries that have received U.S. economic aid are pro-American, and he firmly believes that the United Nations must succeed. He also believes that most people in the world believe his declaration that "the United States has no territorial or imperialistic ambitions, and what it hopes for is the freedom, equality, and independence of all mankind."</p>

Acheson said: The Hungarian people have no real freedom to speak of. Acheson also warned that the Hungarian government should bear full responsibility for this action. In addition to being submitted to the United Nations for handling, there are other ways to deal with this case, but Acheson declined to elaborate on the content of his so-called "other ways."</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Stockholm, 9th] Swedish Foreign Minister Undén told Parliament that the failure of the negotiations on the Scandinavian Defense Pact is an indication that the Swedish government is maintaining its consistent position of not participating in the Cold War. He mentioned that in 1948, he suggested to Norway and Denmark that they conclude a ten-year mutual assistance alliance, with the principle of maintaining collective neutrality, and its main purpose was also to keep the three countries out of war. He also said that the point of divergence between Sweden and Norway is that Norway wants to obtain the guarantee of Western powers.

According to the treaty, the Newfoundland base was leased by Canada to the United States during World War II for a period of ninety-nine years. Now that Newfoundland is about to merge with Canada to form a federal province, this leased base will involve the issue of Canadian sovereignty.</p>

<p>[United Press Lake Success, 8th] The Soviet Union on the 8th demanded that the Security Council condemn the Western network of regional defense pacts and schemes to increase armaments, and ordered the United States to publicly disclose its stockpile of atomic bombs within seven weeks. Soviet representative Malik proposed a proposal that was revived from a previous failed Soviet proposal, which called for an immediate one-third reduction in the armaments and military forces of the five powers of China, the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and the destruction of all atomic bombs, as the first important step in disarmament.</p>
<p>Western representatives quickly defended the Atlantic Pact, which Malik concentrated his attack on, and bluntly condemned the Soviet Union's new disarmament initiative. Malik argued that these regional pacts were "led by aggressors from certain powerful countries, whose purpose is to impose their aggressive policies on other countries, and for this purpose, they are increasing the production of weapons and establishing naval and air bases around the world, which are absolutely inconsistent with the true interests of the countries concerned." Malik charged that these "aggressors" are carrying out a new war. U.S. representative Austin replied that these regional defense pacts were fully in line with the principles of the United Nations and were for "peaceful purposes." He condemned the Soviet Union's proposal as "crude food." The Soviet Union's recent disarmament proposal was doomed to failure from the start. British representative Cadogan coldly stated that the Soviet Union's attempt to revive its failed plan was "a waste of time." At this point, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting until next Thursday.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Copenhagen, 9th] The Danish Foreign Minister told Parliament that the Danish government believes that concluding a Scandinavian defense alliance based on the principle of mutual assistance and considering whether it is possible to receive the necessary military equipment from Western countries, while not providing guarantees to other countries at the same time, is the best way to ensure the security of the three Nordic countries.

<h3 id="e74">Railway Strike Once Again Suffers Setbacks; Passenger Trains on Both Lines Can Resume Today; Four Points of Agreement Reached on New Demands Made by Employees; Method of Adjusting Benefits to be Announced on the 14th <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The railway strike came to a temporary end the night before last, and after passenger trains resumed running at midnight, passenger trains from Beijing and Hangzhou to Shanghai that were blocked at various stations the day before yesterday also arrived in Shanghai one after another yesterday morning. At the same time, thirteen passenger trains left Shanghai for Beijing and Hangzhou. By 2 p.m., another setback occurred. Workers from the locomotive depot and the engineering department invited the entire staff of the transportation department and the North Station to strike and petition the Bureau of Railways, so traffic on both lines was suspended again from 2 p.m. After much mediation, the strike was quelled at 5:15 p.m., and work resumed at 6 p.m. The trains scheduled to depart this morning successively departed after 6 p.m., and passenger trains on both lines are expected to gradually return to normal starting today.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, although some workers worked as usual, other workers gathered at the Workers' Club to discuss and plan to continue fighting for benefits. By 2 p.m., the plan had matured, and a large group of workers went along the tracks to the North Station and the North Station Building, inviting all the staff on the station and in the building to strike and petition the Bureau of Railways. For a time, the momentum was very strong, and the total number of petitioning employees was over 1,000. Director Wang sent Qian Hegao, director of the police department, and Zhang Yunhe, commissioner, to contact the crowd of workers. The workers made five new demands: (1) Wang Zhongqing, a worker who was injured the day before yesterday, should be compensated for medical expenses and 100 shi of rice by the Bureau of Railways. (2) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. (3) Ensure the safety of workers. (4) Adjust housing subsidies (currently 5 yuan per month).

Director of Education Li Ximou first reported on the discussions that had taken place in the past. Mayor Wu then explained that at this time, all municipal schools should give special consideration to social stability, and the fee standards should follow the past ratio between private and municipal school fees. The fees should be determined based on the fee standards resolved by private schools this semester, in proportion to their fees, which is a reasonable measure at present.</p>

<p>[Our Report] News from the Transportation Management Committee's Oil Allocation Committee: Recently, the imported quantity of diesel fuel has been reduced, and supply has repeatedly been out of sync. The fuel for various industries in December of last year and January of this year was allocated together in order to adapt to the actual situation and simplify procedures, which was originally not what was desired. Currently, among various industry users, there are a considerable number who have not purchased fuel from the designated oil company after receiving the fuel allocation notice, while users in urgent need feel there is no oil to buy, resulting in stagnant oil volume and unbalanced supply and demand, which is not fair. In order to regulate supply and demand, the committee will shorten the fuel purchase deadline. If the oil is not purchased from the oil company after the prescribed deadline, the original fuel allocation notice will be cancelled, so that this quota can be reassigned to other users awaiting allocation. However, if the oil company is unable to supply within the deadline, the oil company may indicate this on the back of the fuel allocation order, allowing for an extension.</p>

<p>[Our Report] It is reported that the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai is planning to move from the Construction Building on Jiangxi Road to the six-story building on Beijing Road that is currently occupied by the U.S. Navy Headquarters.

<p>Hundreds of family members of the passengers who died in the Jiangya shipwreck, which occurred more than two months ago, gathered yesterday, carrying coffins of the deceased to the China Merchants Bureau to demand compensation. Yesterday morning, some family members went to the China Merchants Bureau to negotiate, but the responsible parties of the bureau had already received the news and kept the gates tightly closed, refusing entry to the family members, which made the general family members very angry. In the afternoon, more and more people gathered, and four coffins of the deceased were carried to the bureau, with two placed at the Guangdong Road entrance and two at the Bund side entrance. The family members waited outside in the rain, their faces full of grief and anger, creating a tense situation that persisted into the evening. According to a representative of the family members, it has been two months since the Jiangya shipwreck, and the bureau has repeatedly evaded compensation. The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association's aftermath committee also has no concrete solutions. Many of the victims' families can no longer maintain their livelihoods, so they have formed their own compensation committee and are firmly demanding compensation.</p>

All passenger and freight transport operations have been obstructed. Therefore, if they continue to surround and cause trouble from the 10th, all passenger and freight transport lines of the bureau will be forced to suspend operations, and the families of the deceased passengers should be responsible for obstructing transportation. As for the issues of compensation and compensation prices, the bureau is unable to consider them before the responsibility for the Jiangya shipwreck has been determined. Furthermore, employees of the China Merchants Bureau, under police protection, broke through the encirclement at 6:30 PM last night. As the crowd's encirclement situation has not eased, it has been decided to close the office today.</p>

After the doctor performed surgery, it was still ineffective, so she called the office for help. Director Yu Wei arrived by car and performed surgery again. As a result, the mother suddenly collapsed and died of blood loss. Her husband, Xia Genfa, and his father reported the situation to the Songshan Road Police Sub-Bureau, accusing the doctor of manslaughter.

<h3 id="e106">Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association Requests That Transportation of Cotton Yarn to the South Not Be Restricted <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce telegraphed the US Aid Cotton Yarn Joint Management Office to resume the measures implemented by the former Yarn Management Committee to restrict the transportation of cotton yarn to the south. Although the amount of yarn restricted for transportation to the south was not stipulated, the Jianghai Customs has been implementing the above order since the fourth day. Currently, the transportation of cotton yarn to the south has been completely suspended. The Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association believes that with the current state of war and peace undecided, Shanghai is approaching the front lines, North China's transportation is completely cut off, and Yangtze River shipping has also been suspended, the only remaining sales channel for cotton yarn is the South China route. Even the cotton yarn needed by provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi must be transshipped through South China. According to South China's cotton yarn production, the amount is very small, and it has always relied on Shanghai's supply. Now that the need is even greater, the transportation of cotton yarn to the south should be encouraged to meet the needs. Now it is doing the opposite, actually implementing restrictions on the transportation of cotton yarn to the south, which is tantamount to hindering the source of cotton yarn in South China, forcing an imbalance between supply and demand, and creating market panic. Moreover, the dyeing and weaving industry in Shanghai is already facing difficulties in maintaining operations due to rising prices, increased expenses, and sluggish sales. If transportation to the south is restricted, factories will inevitably collapse immediately due to the interruption of sales. The livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers will be cut off, and the impact on social order is particularly concerning. Yesterday, separate telegrams were sent to Mayor Wu, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Shanghai Industrial Association, forwarding them to the Executive Yuan, urging them to promptly instruct the US Aid Cotton Yarn Joint Transport Office and Jianghai Customs to stop implementing restrictions on the transportation of cotton yarn to the south, restore free transportation, and maintain production.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Cotton Yarn Prices Decline <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Cotton yarn sales are mediocre, and there are still many who want to sell off their goods due to the tight money supply. Those in need of funds voluntarily sell off to reduce interest burdens. With supply exceeding demand in the market, prices are slightly soft, and the market is unable to support them, fluctuating downwards. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 360,000 yuan and was bid up to a high of 375,000 yuan, but because buyers were all hesitant to come forward, prices declined again, closing at a low of 350,000 yuan, down 40,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell by 45,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon fell from 315,000 yuan to close at 285,000 yuan, a drop of 35,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at 215,000 yuan, once being inflated to 245,000 yuan, but near the close, they fell again, closing at 220,000 yuan, down 25,000 yuan from the previous day. Factory orders were at 200,000 yuan, with arbitrage for one-day terms reaching a high of 13,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse dropped by 15,000 yuan, closing at 200,500 yuan. There were few transactions in remaining yarn, and prices were also depressed.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market turned weak, and prices followed suit. Because direct sales were sluggish and sentiment was weak, coupled with the tight money supply, buyers were very reluctant to buy, resulting in price relaxation and market depression. However, after positive news spread, sentiment recovered, and various cloths saw progress again. Longtou fine cloth was quoted at around 1,800 yuan at noon, but there were very few transactions. Laba Tong fine cloth opened at 7,100 yuan, down 450 yuan from the previous day. B-Longtou fine cloth initially opened at 6,700 yuan, reached a high of 6,900 yuan, but then retreated to close at 6,500 yuan, down 200 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji and Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Biji fell all the way from 7,900 yuan to a low of 7,400 yuan, and then recovered to 8,100 yuan near the close, finally closing at 8,000 yuan, down 200 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong initially opened at 7,750 yuan, fell to 7,300 yuan midway, recovered to 7,800 yuan at noon, but was still down 100 yuan from the previous day. Other cloths also saw slight declines.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Textile Construction Continues to Dump Inventory <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, China Textile Construction Company continued to dump yarn on behalf of the National Bank and other institutions. A total of 51 lots of 20-count yarn were offered. As a result, 123 households were approved for purchase, totaling 610 lots, worth 119,610,000 yuan. The selling price was calculated as 195,000 yuan for each lot of 20-count Grade A cotton yarn (Double Globe, Golden Rooster, Angel, Golden City, Pisces, Red Bell), and 200,000 yuan for each lot of Gan Gan Gan Li Ma.</p>
<p>In addition, the company sold yarn as usual yesterday, approving purchases for 79 households, totaling 144 lots, worth 44,690,000 yuan. The selling price for each lot of yarn was calculated as 167,000 yuan for 15-count Zhuan Nian, 175,000 yuan for 16-count Red Moon, 188,000 yuan for 21-count Fairy Peach Grade B, 250,000 yuan for 32-count Yang He, 480,000 yuan for 40-count TK Sunlight, 310,000 yuan for 40-count Red Jewel Light, 325,000 yuan for 40-count Three-Strand Red Jewel Light and 42-count Double-Strand Red Li Ma, 370,000 yuan for 42-count Double-Strand Mercerized Color Ball, 480,000 yuan for 60-count Palace Maid, and 1,000,000 yuan for 80-count Double-Strand TK Color Ball.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Tight Credit Situation Worsens <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The trend of tight credit in this city was even more apparent yesterday morning. The interest rates for all industries and markets rose uniformly, averaging around 70 yuan. Only the rice market had a lower price, around 60 yuan. The rubber and cloth markets, on the other hand, fluctuated, initially high and then low, averaging 60 to 65 yuan by noon. The silk market was exceptionally high, once reaching around 75 yuan. The National Bank's rediscount and daily interest rates remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Amidst the recent reports of tight credit in the city, there have been strong rumors in the market that various banks and bureaus are delaying payments for remittances to Shanghai from various regions. National Bank officials formally denied these rumors yesterday morning in response to reporters' inquiries. They stated: "These market rumors are completely unfounded. All national banks and bureaus handle remittance payments according to established procedures and there are no delays. The tightness of credit in the market is a natural consequence of the government's recent dumping of large quantities of goods." They also believed that this phenomenon might continue for several days.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Authorities Still Dumping Inventory Yesterday, Rice Prices Continue to Decline, White Indica and Thin Rice Close at 6,500 Yuan <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's off-site rice prices fell again. Due to tight credit, many cargo owners were eager to sell, but sales were slow. Although rice shops replenished their stocks, the quantities were small. With limited sales channels, prices fell. Prices initially dropped by about 200-300 yuan, and then fell further due to excess supply and sluggish demand. White indica and thin rice closed at 6,500 yuan, and early rice at 6,300 yuan, each falling by 500 yuan. The government dumped 5,000 dan of rice yesterday.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Prices initially fell and then rebounded. At the beginning of the market, due to tighter credit, dealers dumped large quantities of flour, causing panic. Old brand flour initially retreated to the 3,000 yuan level. During the middle of the market, it briefly traded at 2,850 yuan. Near the close, cargo owners were unwilling to sell and buyers became more enthusiastic, causing prices to rise slightly, with transactions at 2,900 yuan. Military Ship brand flour initially opened at 2,800 yuan, traded as low as 2,700 yuan in the middle of the market, and closed at 2,820 yuan. The prices of other miscellaneous brand flour fell below 3,000 yuan across the board.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Prices fell across the board. Velvet beans fell by 10%, opening at 4,500 yuan today. Boyangzi beans fell sharply by 1,000 yuan, trading at 5,000 yuan today. Raw peanuts were oversupplied and undersold, falling by 25%. Nanjing raw peanuts fell below the 10,000 yuan mark. Corn and Qingbang varieties saw weak demand, falling by over 10%. Huangdu corn closed at 2,500 yuan. Red sorghum followed the downward trend. Only picked Qing saw an upward trend.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Prices fell due to tight credit. External commodity prices were uniformly lower, and market sentiment was pessimistic. There were few buyers, while sellers continued to supply. Prices fell due to oversupply and weak demand. Soybean oil fell below 30,000 yuan, closing at 29,000 yuan, a drop of 4,500 yuan. Raw rapeseed oil closed at 24,000 yuan, a drop of 3,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e111">Small Silk Market <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The silk market yesterday continued to hover around the same levels, with prices initially falling slightly and then rising. Credit in the market tightened, with black market interest rates reaching as high as 75 yuan. Many floating orders were sold off, while silk weavers' demand was slack. The market initially weakened and then stabilized.</p>
<p>No. 120 Tianqiao initially opened at 290,000 yuan. Later, loose orders were released, and prices fell again, dropping as low as 275,000 yuan. In the middle of the day, credit tightened and then eased slightly. End users aggressively bought at lower prices, and the market quickly stabilized. It recovered to 300,000 yuan at noon. Next-day settlement traded at 325,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The raw silk market declined yesterday, with very weak sentiment. Initially, due to tight credit, black market interest rates rose, and long positions were sold off. Later, rumors circulated that the China Trust Bureau would dump inventory again, putting further pressure on the market. There were more sellers than buyers in the market, and prices fell at the close. Superior grade raw silk initially saw 340,000 yuan, once falling back to 20,000 yuan. After the low, rumors circulated that the exchange transfer certificate trend was slightly stronger, and the silk market weakened and then stabilized. Dealers held firm, and finally closed at 330,000 yuan at noon, a fall of 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The silk fabric market saw a slight rise. Although black market interest rates were high, there were still many long positions supporting the market. The market was unwilling to fall significantly, and saw a slight rise at the noon close. Mei Ya bed covers initially traded at 193,000 yuan, fluctuating slightly in the middle, rising and falling by around 5,000 yuan. By the noon close, due to weak closing performance, stocks were sold and purchases made, and buying interest became stronger. Market sentiment saw a slightly positive sign, and asking prices gradually rose back, finally closing at 194,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Tea Market Asking Prices Rise <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The red market in tea, which had been holding steady for many days, resumed a stalemate yesterday after opening on the 8th of this month. Although credit tightened, market interest rates rose, and downstream materials outside the circle were weak, dealers felt that tea stocks were almost exhausted, and insisted on holding onto their goods, believing that rare commodities were profitable. Asking prices continued to rise. As a result, even if buyers were willing, it was difficult to fulfill their wishes, and transactions were difficult to complete. Market sentiment remained quiet but gradually strengthened, and the foundation remained quite solid.</p>
