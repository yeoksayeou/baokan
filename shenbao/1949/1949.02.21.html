<h3>劉文輝鄭重聲明　康軍入川係謠傳</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿日電〕關於最近謠傳西康部隊移駐成都事，西康省主席劉文輝，頃於此間鄭重發表聲明如次：所謂西康部隊，卽陸軍廿四軍，乃國家部隊而非地方部隊，其駐防四川名山·卭　·暮津·雙流·成雅道上，迄今達十餘年，最近因到蓉接運軍物，有距蓉四十里原駐雙流部隊兩師開赴成都南門外武侯祠，原屬尋常，不值任何人注意之事，不料近被引為新聞資料，據昨（十九日）大公晚報載，新任漢口市長晏勳甫，於記者招待會上稱：「當此和談局面下，西南某省主席竟胆敢派兵進攻成都。」此一則離奇消息，如成都七十萬市民知之，必當視為無稽之神話，謠言本亂世之特產，造意者固別有用心，有意無意中為之作義務宣傳者以訛傳訛，更進一步將謠言引入神話境界，恐必為造意者夢想不到之成績也。</p>
<h3>夏威飛抵漢</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿日電〕皖主席兼某兵團司令夏威，十九晨自皖飛抵漢，謁華中當局，有所報告。適白總司令因公飛京，故倉卒未及多談。聞夏氏今晨曾訪李品仙，並定日內乘機返防。</p>
<h3>鍾天心由滬抵京　在港洽談經過未允透露　但稱於和談前途已增一些信心</h3>

<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕鍾天心自滬抵京後，當卽往訪居正，于右任，並定於廿一日訪晤童冠賢，白崇禧等。據鍾氏廿日晚語記者，渠此次離穗來京，一面係向李代總統報告此次赴港與中共華南代表洽談經過，一面係代表孫院長向李代總統請示關於政院若干部會首長辭職（如社會·交通·農林等部），應如何局部改組問題，抵滬始知李代總統已決定飛穗，抵京後，李代總統業已成行，現李代總統旣已在穗，則孫院長自可與代總統面談一切。記者詢以渠此次赴港之收穫及觀感如何，鍾氏稱：自港歸來以後，對於和談前途，已多增加一些信心，惟所談內容因受有約束，尙不能透露。所可言者，卽關於八項條件中共華南代表曾加以解釋，渠亦以私人身份就政府對八條之看法加以說明，曾提出一部份意見，請中共華南代表轉達，彼已允照轉。鍾氏並鄭重宣稱：外傳孫院長主戰之說，純係不明眞象，孫院長於政院遷穗辦公時，卽曾通電各省市政府，表示賡續謀促進全面和平。</p>
<h3>香港共黨負責人　否認與鍾氏接觸</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社香港十九日電〕據接近「統一陣綫」之方面强調稱，共黨與其盟碼對於和談，惟志在縮短內戰，惟決不放棄毛澤東於一月十四日提出八條之目標，而要求國民黨政府與其各團體之解散，共黨無論如何，必進達長江以南，剪除封建治權之殘餘，並在中國全部建立民主政府。又稱，近抵北平之京滬和平代表團，共黨當局僅視為該兩地之代表，而為當地人民發表意見，非代表國民黨政府作和談者。再，香港共黨負責人茲切實否認港。粵所傳孫科之代表鍾天心近曾至港與共黨代表接觸，以期開始和談之謠言。</p>
<h3>吳裕後等今赴港　會晤中共負責人</h3>

<p>〔本報蘭州廿日電〕張治中將軍廿日在文化界聯誼會上，解釋渠最近兩度向李代總統懇辭和談代表之原因，在一人挑不起兩副担子，所謂兩副担子者：一為京穗均電邀渠前往共商國是，一為致力於西北之安定進步而無法兼顧。渠曾徵詢與會人之意見，咸盼張氏應在和平確有獲取可能時，仍應為全面和平奔走，冀竟全功。</p>
<p>革新西北回漢團結</p>
<p>張氏繼就西北政治革新有所說明，並對行將崩潰之經濟局面，已商定通盤挽救辦法，經濟緊急應變方案之主旨，為求自力更生，唯在實施之際，因西北地瘠民貧，條件不足，仍需中央協助，日內卽將派員赴京洽商，至土地改革，徵收財產稅土地增值稅等，並非無辦法，遲不實行者，均以土豪劣紳從中作梗，一切民主政治措施固需通過地方民意機構，但今日人民代表是否完全代表民意，實值吾人反省。渠提出警告稱：民主時代潮流迫近了，一切違反時代潮流的必遭淘汰。張氏末指出西北特有之回漢問題，乃滿淸政府毒辣的政治陰謀，吾人應勿為錯誤的歷史所欺騙。基於三民主義之民族主義政策之正確指示，民族間應親愛一如手足，不應再有成見及猜疑，故吾人應將錯誤罪惡之回漢不同思想根本剷除，共將西北團結。安定和平。自由幸福。而奠定永久不拔之基礎。</p>
<p>馬鴻逵主　快刀斬蔴</p>
<p>繼由馬鴻逵將軍致詞，渠主張社會改革應以快刀斬亂蔴的手段行之，勿稍顧忌。關於漢回問題，渠以鄕長身份寄望與會之敎友多加注意與闡解，務勿重蹈歷史覆轍。</p>

<h3>經合署宣布取消禁令　美棉即恢復運華　賴樸翰明後日赴華盛頓</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿日電〕經合總署發言人稱：經合總署已取消棉花運華之禁令。十九日並已通知裝運棉花者恢復裝運，實際裝運將於下週內開始，自美國海口運至上海。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕一千五百萬元美棉，前因中國內戰停止運華，巳逾一星期，今日由經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼下令恢復運輸，於二三兩月內在上海交貨。據中國事務處長克利夫蘭稱，經合總署對上海供應情形認為滿意，可允恢復運輸。此項美棉共約一萬包，前以中國局勢不定，經合總署不願其有大量存貨堆積，故下令停運。內有一萬包禁運時巳在途中，擬令轉往日本，其餘亦均準備裝運·經合總署已向輪船公司保證，無論如何，決不令受損失，或須由總署自行收買，改運歐洲等處。數星期前，總署因大沽口駁船被國軍於作戰時沒收，亦曾停運小麥麵粉至華北。</p>
<p>〔中央社舊金山十九日電〕據經合總署中國分署署長賴樸翰稱：國會委員會將於三月一日左右開始在華盛頓討論經合總署今後之援華計劃。賴氏昨自上海抵此，將在家中盤桓數日，擬於廿二日或廿三日往華盛頓向霍夫曼報告並出席國會委增說明。賴氏在未向霍夫曼報告前，不願發表任何關於美國繼續援華之意見。此間各報今載中國共產黨攫取經合署在北平救濟麵粉之消息，霍華德系之舊金山新聞報，在赴論中支持前數日五十一員共和黨議員因鑒於中國共黨得勢，致函杜魯門總統，建議指派高級人員組織軍事，經濟及政治委會，重新檢討美對華政策。社論中稱，該函「具有建議性，而無黨派偏見」。社魯門總統應根據此項友好建議有所行動，並使公衆注視遠東情勢。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十九日電〕美國前國務部遠東司長霍倍克，今日在外交政策協會發表演說稱，美國能否不助中國，此為當前一大問題，雖其時聞已遲，惟南京政府尙在作戰，此為全亞洲惟一獨立自主之政府在抵抗共產黨前進。美國若切實決定放棄中國，聽其自然，則將立卽失去一百年來在中國及遠東之所獲。歐洲本身，若不能取得東亞資源，並與之通商，亦難完全恢復。共產黨在亞洲所得愈多，民主國家與克里姆林宮衝突達到熱戰階段之危險愈大，吾人在歐洲之所獲，亦將迅卽喪失，而成為蘇聯之資產。中國應有發展為一民主國家，並願繼續作為遠東自由堡壘之機會，此在中美兩國均極重要，目前至少尙有一延畏抵抗之機會，美國應在道義上及物質上盡量援助此抵抗。哥倫比亞大學敎授遠東問題專家裴孚之演說，其主張適得其反。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>看日本聯合內閣</h3>
<p>吉田内閣，爲日本戰後第七屆內閣，於本月十六日宣佈組成，誠如我們所料，這是戰後日本極保守右傾的獨裁內閣，無論人事上或政策上，均無新衆象可言。論人事，內閣連首相和大臣十八席，民主自由黨佔有十六席，民主黨僅得二席，點級於一黨政府以內。吉田首相兼任外務大臣，他的老友林　治留任厚生大臣，其他均爲政界一三流人物出任，不足重視。論政策，據吉田組閣首次聲明，係保證對共黨作戰，並集中日本全國力量，加速經濟復興。吉田又允諾實施美國當局指導日本復興的九項原則，並實行嚴格行政改革，保持財政穩定，减除一切非必要的支出。至內閣詳細的施政綱領，尙未制就，大約仍循前屆的方針，不可能有新奇的進步的表現。日本戰後的政治，始終停滯在舊形態的階段，由之可以得到說明了。</p>
<p>吉田內閣在內政上或經濟政策上可能成功麽？它對日本國內及遠東局勢，將發生如何的影響？實有分析說明之必要。先說反共，査共產黨在日本的勢力，本極脆弱，前屆衆院四六六席中，僅有四席爲共產黨員，此次總選結果，乃竟當選了三十五名，約佔九倍之多，如以全體選票數字計算，說明在全國選票三千二百萬中，該黨獲得了三百五十萬之多，換言之，平均每九個日本選民，即有一人投共產黨的票。日共勢力膨脹之不可輕侮，一方面是中共軍事發展刺激了日本人民，助長了日共及總選中的勝利，另方面由於過去幾屆内閣施政上的失敗，事事表現貪汚腐敗，泄泄杳沓，造成日共發展的機會。吉田內閣以反共爲職志，以其力量及麥帥支持的便利來說，吉田足可壓抑共黨的發展，殆無疑義。不過，吉田係以右傾的施政和保守的姿態來反共的，毫無民主進步徵象可言，彼是否能阻遏此一赤流，實値得慎重注意的。</p>
<p>再說經濟復興，這是今天日本軍國主義復活重要的課題。麥帥去歲指導日本實行的九項原則，其主要目的是引導舊日本之復興，所謂企業管理及產業合理化等的實則，恰使日本資產階層膨脹剝削力量，另一方面，則便日本勤勞階層的失業數字有日益龐大之危。像這樣帶有危險性的經濟政策，不但舊日本由之復活，完全違背了波茨坦宣言的原則，並且對於日共發展有獎勵作用，甚至有刺激舊日本侵略狂熱欲復活的作用。日本經濟學者一致僉認此項經濟復與，並無裨益日本經濟民主化的前途，它祗是把日本帶向另一新的戰爭，爲美國　　之前衛。吉田茂說：「本屆普選中的勝利，是日人願有目前的民主政治，健全保守主義，及人民欲有政治安全的明證」，如多數的日人像吉田所說的，則日人心理上需要一個舊日本的復活，以及不惜再度侵略戰爭以復活舊日本，將由此而得到充分的朋證了。</p>
<p>根據上述分析的事實看來，說明吉田日內閣之出現，乃日本右傾保守勢力又一次成功，它與共黨對立鬥爭的結果，必使日本政治底流的兩極化，不但不能避免，且有日益尖銳之勢。日共於吉田組閣成功之日，揚言將使吉田內閣夭折，大約將利用勞動攻勢，和經濟九項原則的缺點，設法在多方面瓦解吉田內閣，或使吉田的政策失敗，然後迫使日本人民向左轉。總之，日本政治上的風潮將一天比一天險惡，左右政黨有對立，右派政黨內部亦有分化，「吉田丸」航至何處觸礁，對於日本兩極化政治必將發生決定性的影響，是値得細心注意的。</p>
<h3>利用外國新聞機構　陰謀者散佈流言　某負責人發表談話予以指斥</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕昨日報載合衆社記者張國興南京十九日電謂：「暫時引退的蔣總統，仍在發佈命令，仍保有足够的總統權力，使渠能在未來的對共和談中施用否決權，同時渠正每日行使此等權力，俾洞開復職之門。」並謂：蔣總統經常對國防部及中央銀行總裁發出各種指示。該記者甚至謂：「蔣氏在引退中仍行使總統權力，似爲李宗仁的對共謀和以及推行激烈的政治改革的一重阻礙」。「反動分子在蔣氏的蔭護之下，在全國施展其影響及權力，以圖阻撓或破壞李宗仁的和平努力，並準備迎蔣氏復職」云云。中央社記者頃就張國興所發此項電訊，叩詢此間某負責人之意見，據稱：此顯然係陰謀分子利用外國新聞機構及濫用政府區域之新聞自由權利，故意散佈惡毒流言，企圖誣蔑蔣總統赤誠爲國之純潔與偉大，破壞其信譽，離間蔣總統及李代總統之感情，製造險惡政潮，而加深中國之危機。所幸此類陰謀分子之手法殊爲笨拙幼稚，明眼人一見卽知其用意所在，而決不致爲其所欺弄也。</p>

<h3>山東中共當局　頒布關科法規　由港開出船　隻多駛魯北海口</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社香港十九日電〕山東中共當局已頒布關稅法規，規定入口貨物之徵稅辨法，香港方面近接到該項法規多份，中國商界人士正秘密傳觀中。據消息靈通人士稱，入口貨物分爲三種，（一）進口時完全免稅者，如鋼。鐵。卡車。藥品等。（二）並非必需之貨物，則按其性質分別征稅。（三）禁止輸入之貨物，包括種類甚多之「奢侈品」，如香水。絲襪。尼龍絲襪等。據中國權威人士稱，天津區域亦將頒布類似之關稅法規。香港與共黨區域間之貿易，以往係取道北朝鮮，但過去數週來已直接與山東交易，原來向北朝鮮駛行之輪船多艘，近已改駛烟台或山東北部其他港口，香港現有船多艘亦將駛往山東，然官方許可證所開之目的地仍爲北朝鮮，因香港當局拒發給駛行共黨海港之許可證，山東方面關稅法之頒布，使此間中外商界人士深感興趣，此間商人對於恢復與華北之貿易關係均感不耐，甚至最重傳統之英國公司，亦正設法與共黨接觸，俾從事貿易。香港之貿易額在一九四八年中曾不斷增加，而目前已現下落之徵象，進口貨已自去年十二月之一億五千八百萬港幣跌至一月之一億五千九百萬港幣，香港之倉庫中充斥商貨，由於國民政府治下之中國日見解體及共黨佔領區域之封鎖，其出路日見狹獈，因此恢復對華北貿易可使香港商界獲得新生機，對於此種貿易之前途，意見紛紜，中外多數商人認爲，對華北之大規模貿易可以早日恢復，如此，美國將蒙不利，而香港與英國則日佔上風。然若干外國商人認爲，毛澤東最近聲明之貿易制度，應爲「解放」區與其他區域間貿易之基礎，故不易發展大規模之貿易關係，根據目前對北朝鮮及山東之方法，貨物係由香港之中國人士購入，並付款，並由特別租貨之船隻運往，同時，此間多數商界人士指陳，共黨曾有多次表示，對於恢復與外國之正常貿易關係甚感興，尤其見機器及重要工業品之供應，因華北對此種物品極爲需要，中國商業公司駐共區之代表多人，近曾返港購貨，渠等希望此爲中共區域與外界間恢復正常貿易之徵象。</p>
<h3>徐學禹談南北通航　要義在保護航權　目前麵粉換煤係「謹愼」之舉</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿日電〕招商局總經理徐學禹談南北洋通航問題稱：「通航之重要意義之一，在於保護我國内河航行權。渠認爲倘英商太古公司之湖南輪載運開灤煤赴香港之目的達到後，則不僅滬市所需之煤需用外匯轉向外國購買，且將造成外輪航行我國內河之先例」。渠同時指出香港用煤過去仰給於非洲，運費成本比較開灤煤爲高，說明英人急速派輪北駛，兼有貿易上之動機。徐學禹對於目前初期之南北洋通航，僅限於以麵粉換煤一事，認爲係「謹愼」之措施。記者詢以何時可以增加物資種類，及添辦客運？渠稱：一時恐難辦到，尙待繼續努力。徐氏係日前來台，廿日已返滬。渠與台省主席陳誠會談之結果，雙方同意由合灣銀行每月貸給招商局台灣分局台幣十億元，而由招商局每月自滬購買相當款額之麵粉，運台歸還。</p>

<h3>歐洲復興計劃　美國最大買賣</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十五日電〕基督敎科學箴言報，二月十二日以「美國最大之買賣」爲標題，發表社論稱：</p>
<p>正當國會開始討論馬歇爾計劃第二年的時候，適巧有一批可靠的美國觀察家正在重訪歐洲，並報吿一年前以來所能看到的各種變更。美國人也能從經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼向國會所提出的數字中看到這些變更。或則他們也能在自由的新聞記者所供給比較輕鬆的材料中看到。</p>
<p>他們能把經合總署對於一九四九年至一九五〇年財政年所請求的數目四十二億八千萬美元，和上年財政年的五十億五千五百萬美元，作一比較。或則他們從各個軍站和建築物上新近粉刷的踏步，和擦得雪亮的銅欄杆上，能想像到倫敦的景象。</p>
<p>他們能從如下的事實上得到鼓勵：卽經合總署各官員以爲明年歐洲能繼續有眞正的進步，而美國的援助則可减少。或則他們能注意到，美國的援助，在英國，法國，和義大利，已有何種意義。</p>
<p>正如經合署長霍夫曼在硏究美援第一年的效果以後所說的：「如果這個計劃帶給我們和平與安定——照我所相信的——那末它將成爲美國人民歷來所有的最大的買賣」。</p>
<p>正如新聞記者亞爾索普從倫敦寫來的話：「如果好消息被一般承認爲有標題的價値，那末倫敦所發生的情形，早就成爲美國各報的標題了。在去年，英國人民已完成了一個奇蹟。」</p>
<p>另一個記者說：「美援實際上已經使義大利站了起來。」關於這個計劃的成功，國會是無所置疑的。美國不祗需要以機器及原料去供應歐洲以改進他們的生活，尙須供給武器以保護這種改進。因此未來的問題更形複雜，這種需要的存在，當然應歸功於經濟計劃的成功。但這確實意味着美國與歐洲的努力應分爲生產措施與非生產防禦措施兩類。</p>
<p>可喜的是援歐的趨勢已使歐洲畫面起了一基本的變化最初馬歇爾計劃下的物資，大部份是糧食與農產品，是準備立卽消費之用，是爲了提高糧產所必要的農產品，但到去年秋季，至少二分之一的物資已是工業物資，歐洲獲得新的工業裝備，從事生產。收獲情况的良好，與工廠出品的增加，支持了這個計劃。</p>
<p>一九五二年馬歇爾計劃時期結束後，意料中的歐洲大量美元的虧細，將多少使這些進展爲之减色。同樣地，美國人看到歐洲各政府未能更進一步的相互合作，也不免感到失望。</p>
<p>但這些因素都不能成爲有力的反證，而令我們不再以全力進行這個計劃，這個計劃在其第一年的成就中，已經使我們得到很大的收獲。歐洲內部的貿易，將减輕歐洲依賴美元的程度，而歐洲在合作下所已獲得的進展，將促使他們更進一步的相互合作。</p>

<h3>美陸次屈拉普辭職照准　東京方面極感震驚　日人懷疑美國對日復興計劃將有變更　麥帥認為美有保護日義務</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京二十日電〕美陸軍部次長屈拉着之辭職，今引起日人極度不安，蓋日人認爲屈拉普乃「重建日本」政策主張最力者。此辭戰緊隨所傳陸軍部長羅雅爾主張重行審査美國在遠東之軍事位置（後來已否認）故日人對屈拉普之離去極表悲觀。彼等不能確言此對日本有何利害，但確信對日本絕對不利。雖然屈拉普之辭職久已向杜魯門總統提出。但正當爭論羅雅爾在東京記者招待會中所透露究爲何意時接受辭呈，使日人相信其中定有道理。彼等之不安，一部由於對美國全面經濟復興日本事，缺乏信心。不管美國對日軍事政策爲何，羅雅爾及其他任何高級美官員，皆未曾暗示經濟援助日本將予停止——若日人表示決心自助。此間觀察家相信：羅雅爾及屈拉普至少已見及日本在經濟方面之需要。但屈氏之辭職殊使日人震驚。屈拉普之工作直接與佔領區有關，故渠之離去發生誰爲其繼承人之問題，日人對此問題，現正急切等待答案。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕白宮今日宣布，陸軍部次長屈拉普將於本月廿八日辭職，辭呈已由社魯門總統批准。屈氏爲共和黨人，出身金融界，一九四七年十月起任陸次，對於日德兩國佔領政策，多所擘劃，日本調査報吿書，尤爲受人批評。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿日電〕根據此間一切跡象所示，麥克阿瑟元帥認爲美國現對日本人民有經濟上義務，並至少有保護日本不受侵略之暫時義務。麥帥不願來涉於「羅雅爾事件」之内，但渠在過去之談話明白顯出渠對於美國對日本責任問題之意見。麥帥旣負責在此督導，當然可信渠之意見在美國訂定對日政策方面有重要地位。麥帥曾屢次指日本為盟國之戰犯，實際上為美佔領軍之戰犯，並曾謂美國負有經濟上照顧此等罪犯之義務。渠至少有一次曾謂，佔領軍負有担任日本安全直至簽訂和約方止之責任。渠甚至復提起和約簽訂以後何人保護日本之問題。在答復其自己之問題時，麥帥曾一度暗示日本應用聯合國保障。此外，渠並曾暗示，駐於冲繩島之美空軍可負此任。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京二十日電〕佔領官員廿日表示意見稱，在陸次屈拉普辭職後，美對日政策並無一改變。盟軍總部經濟及科學組主任拉加特少將稱，現並無跡象表示有影響日本之任何改變。</p>
<h3>美對日政策分歧　工業水準與賠償問題意見分裂　遠東委會工作徬徨無主</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕據本社調査遠東委員會問題之結杲，顯示蘇聯代表之不時抨擊，對於遠委會功能之破壞性，並不如一般想像之甚。經本社詢問意見之遠委會人士表示，遠委會不能更迅速進行其工作之一項基本理由，乃因美迄今未能決定應准許日本得有何種工業水準之政策。彼等稱，在此一決定成立之前，賠償問題不能解決，因此遠委員亦不能明瞭其最後計劃應當如何。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表潘友新之要求及公開聲明，曾使不熟悉遠委會之人士認爲蘇聯之策略或在阻撓該委會之工作。但據本社所詢問之代表等稱，眞正問題所在，乃「美國何時可決定」。另據熟知美國困難所在之人士稱，此等困難由於對工業及賠償兩問題之兩項相反意見所致。一派認爲日本一切現有工業應留給日本，俾日本在經濟上能强盛而自給自足，另一派則認爲日本工業應拆除至最低程度，俾受日本侵略之犧牲者能獲得公正之賠償。遠委會諸代表對於潘友新不顧該委會會議之秘密性，而時常公開發表聲明一節，傳殊感困惱。代表等對潘氏所言内容，亦甚不同意。彼等感覺潘友新在利用遠委會作爲宣傳地。另據本社所訪問之代表等稱，蘇聯代表團在進行該委會工作之普通事務方面「十分合作」。據硏究最近發表之報吿所得，顯示遠委會每月至少宣佈一項蘇聯亦加贊同之政策決議，蘇聯對此等決議本可加以否決。</p>
<h3>史沫特萊　抱怨美軍當局</h3>
<p>名譽雖遭洗刷但無法補償</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十九日電〕名作家史沫特萊十九日感謝陸軍部「洗淸其名譽」。但稱，她對被控爲蘇聯間諜事，已遭受不可補償之損失。她的辯護律師代其發表敍述稱：「我對陸軍部洗淸我被控爲蘇間諜之名譽表示感激。但同時，我必須說明，撤回已不及之謊語，除金錢損失外，我已遭受不可補償的痛苦。我希望這種先汚辱後調査的政策可予結束，並設法制止官員對忠誠公民之誹謗，而彼等則隱藏在不能被控訴的法律之後。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十九日電〕麥帥官方發言人吿合衆社稱：麥帥總部對陸軍部在華盛頓承認發表戰前共黨在中國及日本之間諜案乃「失當」一節，將無「立刻」反應。麥帥之新開局長艾柯斯上校並未表示何時將有反應。渠於二月十一日舉行記者招待會時，曾吿外國記者稱，渠對陸軍部沙奇間諜案之報吿，負「完全責任」</p>
<h3>粵照會四強會議　要求准列席陳辭</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十九日電〕奧國駐倫敦公使館頃以其政府名義，向四織外長代表會議提出照會一件，宣布該會於廿四日聽取南斯拉夫外次貝勃勒陳述意見時，奧國代表亦將列席。照會中要求廿八日以後，奧國亦應有權與會陳述奧國意見。</p>
<h3>保被牧師　下週將受審</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紫菲亞廿日電〕保加利亞正敎之法師及回敎敎長，向新聞界發表聲明：在保國宗敎絕對自由，並痛斥十五名之新敎牧師所犯之美國罪。</p>
<p>〔合衆肚索菲亞十九日電〕保加利亞政府報紙報吿稱，將於下　寫叛騙間　及黑市交易等罪變　之基督敎牧師十五人之一業已招認。祖國陣綫報稱，福音教會牧師雅浦可夫，承認將情報供給英美情報人員。渠爲認爲乃「英美人及福音敎會簡之聯絡人。」</p>
<h3>明眞謗受審案　匈發表黑皮書</h3>
<p>指西方對該案加以誹謗</p>
<p>〔合衆社布達佩斯十九日電〕匈政府十九日否認曾檢査有關於最近審判明眞諦之各電訊。匈政府在發表樞機主敎叛國審判之「黑皮書」中作此項否認。序言中特指出西方世界對處理審問之「誹謗」。</p>
<h3>挪威工黨以壓倒多數　批准政府外交政策　維護安全應與西方家合作</h3>
<p>〔聯合社挪威京城十九日電〕挪威工黨今日終日舉行秘密會議，由外長蘭琪報吿與英美接洽北大西洋盟約情形，當夜以三百廿九票對三十五票通過漢議，核准工黨政府之外交政策。</p>
<p>挪威正式接受西方國家邀請參加北大西洋聯防條約，現祗餘一關，僅需議會通過蘭琪所擬外交方針，此事在下星期内可付表決，屆時全體議員一百五十人中，除共黨十一席外，均可投贊成票。蘇聯曾於三星期中兩次警吿挪威勿加入北大西洋聯盟，挪威對第二次照會尙未答覆，在答覆第一次照會中，會表示願意硏究區域同盟之可能性。蘇聯於第二次照會中，請挪威與之訂立互不侵犯條約，最近發展顯示挪威亦將拒絕此建議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社奧斯陸二十日電〕挪威工黨全國理事會通過決議案如下，「全國理事會認爲挪威關於國防問題，應經由與西方民主國家合作之手段解決安全問題，此次合作應根據於聯合國憲章，並在實際以及形式上純粹爲防衛性與和平意義之合作」。</p>
<h3>玻國破獲革命陰謀　總統下令全國戒嚴　革命運動領袖八人被捕</h3>
<p>〔合衆社玻璃維亞京城二十日電」漢德索總統在玻璃維國戒嚴。若干被指與該項陰謀有關之人仕業遭逮捕。玻政府並已正式對秘魯提出抗議，斥其允許玻璃維亞政治流亡者在其境内活動。漢德索指斥「在一九四六年七月被推翻的」極右派國家主義份子，正在國內外密謀推翻現政府。</p>
<p>〔聯合社玻璃維亞京城二十日電〕政府今日採取緊急措施，防止自秘魯與阿根廷兩國逐出之玻璃維亞人預定今晨實行之暴動。該項暴動主謀者乃前玻璃維亞官員二人，現在秘魯政府供職。擁護前總統維拉洛爾之民族革命運動領袖八人已於昨日就逮，其他要犯亦在搜捕中。</p>
<h3>北歐動向蘇表關切</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十九日電〕蘇聯「紅艦隊報」十九自稱：斯坎的那維亞國家對反對大西洋公約之抗議行動，顯然在高漲中。在拉入大西洋公約威脅下之斯坎的那維亞國家曾舉行數次關於防務及和平之會議。該報又稱，美帝國主義力促將捆威成爲攻擊蘇聯之前哨地，已遭遇挪威人民之不斷反對。</p>
<h3>工潮此仆彼起　義政局動盪</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬十九日電〕以往四十八小時中，義政局大起波動，其故一爲伊索拉台爾列里之工潮，一爲戰犯波格希斯親王之開釋，引起義人民許多方面之抗議。左翼各黨曾抨擊此次警察應付工潮之失當。繼而羅馬曾作總罷工數小時，北部數鎭亦有停工及聚衆遊行示威情事。反對黨現正利用新局勢，以圖推翻天主敎黨加斯貝利領導之聯合政府。</p>
<h3>埃及總理向美國呼籲　經濟援助擴至中東　駐埃英軍不撤斷難容忍</h3>
<p>〔合衆社開羅二十日電〕埃及總理哈第二十日在單獨提交合衆社的書面談話中，呼籲美國將馬歇　計劃擴晨至中東，俾協助阻遏共產主義而不致失之過晚‘此係哈第繼諾克拉西任總理以來首次對外國記者發表的談話。</p>
<p>哈第稱，雖然埃及在職時對盟國頗多貢獻，但她並未在馬歇爾計劃下獲得援助。渠稱，「埃及希望能獲得如英國給予土希及西歐的政治支持及物質援助」。我應當指出中東的共產主義危機，並不低於其他歐亞各部，而且在失之過晚之前，以類似西歐的經濟援助給予中東，則中東免於共產主義的危機時機始終存在」。哈第稱，埃美間關係良好，可是美國僅在支持猶太人對抗阿拉伯人中，顯示其對中東的政治興趣。渠稱，阿拉伯人爲「他們的國家的合法及和平爲懷的主人」。哈第稱，英埃關係「多少係冷淡及沉滯的」，此係由於「英國企圖在兩國互協新約中加於埃及的條件」的關係，渠稱，目前英軍留駐埃及係不可容忍之事，雖然英國在一九四六年宣佈其撤退一切駐軍的意向，但至今迄朱實現</p>
<h3>技術援助新計劃　可分三步驟進行　全部完成一需世紀</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕杜魯門總統開發經濟落後國家新計劃，龐大繁複之至。美與聯合國多數專家咸認爲總統僅能開其端倪，整個計劃之完成，至少須時三十年，甚至須要百餘年。該計劃並非僅是開辦工廠或倡導耕種新方法問題，而在將各國整個經濟及文化，推進一世紀或一世紀以上。計劃實施範國，包括拉丁美洲一大部份，亞洲。遠東。非洲與中東，總人口達十六億五千萬人。開頭幾年化費不多，第一步將徵募及訓練大批科學家，技術人員及專家，作爲幹事。第二步在帮助各國擬訂長期開發計劃。第三步開始投資，範圍極大，且前尙無具體計劃。落後國家最迫切需要爲糧食，但美與西歐高度農業生產技術，一時不能在各該區實現，故最好辦法，只有工業革新與農業改良相輔並進。不適於煉鋼之區域，不能建築鋼鐵廠，毌寗建築若干輕工業工廠，如布廠。鞋廠。家俱與日用品製造廠。此種工廠之成立，可以提高生活標準，並可使農人利用一年中大部份閑暇時間作工。亞洲產米區此種「隱藏的失業」，實是低生活標準之主要原因。</p>
<h3>印度與海邦　捕共黨數百人</h3>
<p>印錫竟黨領袖亦就逮</p>
<p>〔聯合社孟買十九日電〕印度警察今日在全國大舉搜捕共黨，以防止一百萬鐵路工人罷工。各以醖釀鐵路工潮被控。全國鐵路橋樑現均有警察駐守。此外，海德拉巴德邦亦有數百人被擁，該邦軍政府並禁止五人以上集會，及携帶兵械，懸掛共產黨旗，或列隊遊行。新德里方面，政府宣布已拘搏　克社會黨領袖泰拉辛，惟此事與檢舉共黨無關。泰氏偕同伴二人赴新德里參加宗敎性質會議，政府調其係政治結合，卽在軍站被捕。</p>
<h3>英裝備暹軍　防止共黨潛入</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十九日電〕外交部發言人今日稱，英政府已同意配備暹羅軍隊五連，充實國防，以防共黨自他國潛入。此種宣布恰在暹政府宣布全國戒嚴以防共黨潛入之後一日。英國駐東南亞特派員麥唐納上月訪暹時，卽認爲英暹有協力制止暹　與馬來邊界華人共黨活動之必要。</p>
<h3>蘇聯投票選舉　人民法庭法官</h3>

<h3>皮杜爾演說</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十九日電〕法人民共和黨全國委會今日辯論外交政策時，前外長皮杜爾發表演說稱，「由於吾人不克根據地理之疆界建立歡洲，吾人將根據自由之疆界建立歐洲。」皮氏又稱，法國會盡其全力避免世界陷於分裂，「大西洋公約之產生，乃由於莫斯科會議之失敗，及蘇聯決心拒絕馬歇爾計劃之故。目前之問題爲法國應與依其自由意志決心與吾人合作之國家共同建立歐洲。」</p>

<h3>莫須名君　嘉惠清寒　慨捐百萬金圓助學　呼籲各界繼起響應</h3>
<p>本報卅八年度春季「讀老助學金」勸募至今，已逾一月，原定目標五百石米，尙未募足半數，我們正爲許多淸寒學子焦慮，這幾天準備發給各校申請書，照募得之數，只能分配給一百五十名大中學生，等於原定目標三分之一弱。在數額上說：乃本報倡導助學十年來最低劣的紀錄，昨日本報記者偶與莫須名君談及此事，當蒙慨然允諾，立捐百萬金，運以前各方所捐，總算湊足二百五十石白米，他還想拋磚引玉，呼籲各方再捐二百五十石，併爲五百石，以完成本屆預定的目標。這位「莫須名」君，十年夾熱心助學，對新聞報及太報助學金，捐款不計其數，受惠的淸寒學子，何止千數。他向來不露眞姓，不求虛名，我們尊稱他為「助學老人」，真是名實相符，決非過譽。下面便是老人的親筆信：</p>
<p>「逕啓者，查貴報歷届舉辦清寒學生助學金，每屆均能超過預定目標，裨益學子，實非淺尠。昨日貴館社會服務科黃寄萍先生到舍間，與鄙人談及本屆助學金籌募目前，原定白米五百石，或金圓五百萬元，預計能助大中學淸寒學生四五百人，詎料至本日止（二月十九日）尙祗募得金圓一百五十萬元之譜，意欲圖人向名方接洽籌募，以期達至預定目標之願望等云。鄙人對於淸寒學生，深表同情，在此心餘力絀之環境下，勉强募到金圓一百萬元，明知杯水車薪，無濟於事，總算凑成貫報預定目標之半數，聊盡棉薄而已，所幸貴報辦理成績，有口皆碑，繼續向讀者呼籲，滬地不乏樂善同情人士，一致伸出援助之手，莫說尙缺原定目標之半數，不難達到，也就超過預定目標，亦屬可能，清寒學生幸甚，社會幸甚，鄙人莫須名啓，二月廿日。</p>

<h3>蘇省主席談基本敎育　掃除文盲建設新江蘇　正全力推行決以上海為示範縣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江于蘇省政府目前正以全力推行基本敎育，并決定以上海爲示範縣，本報駐鎭江記者對此問題，特赴省廬訪晤丁治磐主席，侃侃談一小時餘。他闢頭就說，我是個軍人出身，今日中國之亂，就是缺乏了基本敎育，據最高敎育當局的統計，全中國民衆還有百分之八十以上的文肓存在，他們都停留在愚昧無知的半原始生活狀態中，這許多民衆，一方面中於「無知」，翁於爲人利用，在不知不覺之中，造成了今日社會間的一切矛盾，一方面也由於「無能」配合政府建設的重任，以致延長了建國的過程，依本人看法，要建設社會，消滅亂源，必需從實施最低限度的基本敎育着手，才能衝破這一些壁壘的障礙。</p>
<p>要從根改造</p>
<p>丁氏織稱：江蘇敎育文化，過去素稱發達，一切敎育上的設施，常常會影響到全國的敎育，現在國難尙未解除，本人到任後，爲了實現新江蘇的理想，一定要從脚跟上加以改造，必先從「人」敎育起，了是治本方針。丁氏說到這裏，說了一段故事給記者聽，他說：河北的定縣和山東的鄒平，因爲這兩處地方，在地方自治史上留下了不可磨滅的光榮事跡，定縣是應用「三種方式」，試騐「四大敎育」，完成「六大建設」。鄒平是以「鄕學」，「村學」的敎育活動，爲推進鄕村建設的中心。他們都是以敎育爲起點，逐漸的培養人民「管敎養衛」的能力，後來收効非常驚人。</p>
<p>精神及做法</p>
<p>基本敎育的精神及做法如何呢？丁氏很詳細的吿訴記者，第一：可以提高民衆素質，奠定國民文化基礎，因爲國民文化是一個國家强弱的測量器，尤其在科學發達的現在，文化水準的提高，實爲當務之急。我們在基本敎育示範縣及示範區内，決定加緊實施義務敎育，及補習敎育，以期肅淸文盲。第二：可以促進地方自治，建立國民政治基礎。基層政治關係極爲重要，民衆有了組織，才能發揮力量。同時保甲長最接近民衆，是否能忠實的推行政令，實實在在關係國家前途。我們在基本敎育示範縣區内一定要做到培養幹部，協助組訓民衆，并助成警勤區制的圓滑推動。第三：勵行生產建設，鞏固國民經濟基礎。民富而後國富，這是　撲不破的原理。目前我們國度裏農村破產，民生凋斂，皆是生產能　落後的結果。我們在基本敎育示範縣區內，要配合生產計劃，以灌輸科學知識爲手段，使民衆能以科學方法，從事增產，進而提高人民生活技能。</p>
<p>最後丁氏以很輕鬆的口吻說了兩句：希望他的基本敎育主張，不但能實行於江蘇全省的每個角落，更希望漸漸的做到全國的示範。</p>

<h3>輸管委會鼓勵　輸日售現貿易</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中日貿易，去年經政府決定局部開放，准許商人參加，惟在和約未簽訂以前，暫以易貨爲原則，自去年七月迄今，易貨成績尙屬可觀。貿易數字，輒經輸出入管理委員會披露，現該會認爲輸日售現貿易可增加我國外匯收入，亟應予以鼓勵，經與財政部關務署及工商部各機關一再磋商，茲探悉其辦法決定如后：</p>
<p>（一）凡商人擬輸日貨物售現者，應先將售貨合同，送經駐日盟軍總部核准。</p>
<p>（二）商人輸出貨物時，應塡具出口結匯證明書，附同日方所開之信用狀，照章向指定銀行結售外匯，並由指定銀行簽證。</p>

<h3>本週出口貨品　限價無大變動</h3>

<p>棉籽油（桶裝）每長噸四〇〇美元</p>
<p>靑泊（桶裝）每長噸一八〇英鎊</p>

<p>花生餅　每長噸五〇美元</p>

<p>檜木帽　（第一至第三品質）　每打三·五〇美元</p>
<p>檜木帽　（第二至第四品質）　每打　二·七五美元</p>
<h3>呢絨成本砌增</h3>
<p>全滬呢絨廠商，最近大感苦悶，其主要原因爲原料昂缺，定到不易。電力及煤價高漲，生活指數續高，成本與日俱增。製造過程拖長，由毛條上紡車起至整理成品止，卽設備完全之紡織廠，亦須三五個月，至普通廠家，委托他人代紡代整理者，更須延長，資金常憾轉週不靈，若借高利貸解急，猶如飲鴆止渴。此外以環境關係，銷路賡續减遜，市價常多低於成本云。</p>
<h3>木材成本不夠</h3>
<p>木材行市，農歷開年後迄今，雖步做步高，但以成本而論，市價均未及頂點。如洋松國外定價，每呎須一角五分半，依一千六百元結匯證計算，卽需二百四十八元。外加從價海關稅與利潤等項，至少成本在三百五十元以上。現市塲開價，最高喊一百六十至七十元，然求頭寸者，一百卅元亦有斬售，大致則爲一百四十至五十元。又杉木產地價須卅五元，加七八折匯水及運駁等外費，最少須六十元一尺。而市塲僅做五十元，均屬不敷成本，此實爲實銷問題所致云。</p>
<h3>巡視海南鐵鑛</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　梁智</p>
<p>〔太報海南島十四日訊〕作爲開發海南島鑛山寶藏唯一機構，規模宏大的資源委會海南島鐵鑛局，亦設於楡林港。該局自勝利後，經二年餘之籌備，至去年五月始正式成立。該局田獨鐵鑛組織與各種業務情形如下：（一）組織：共職員九十七員，（內工程人員四十六人）工友一千四百二十一人，（內技工三百六十六人），設礦長副鑛長各一，下設工務，採礦，裝運，管理，會計，材料等六組，醫院一所（二）田獨鑛山；有東西兩鑛體，鑛藏量計四，八〇〇，〇〇〇噸，經日本採取二，六〇〇，〇〇〇噸。該鑛局自成立迄今，開採約二五，〇〇〇噸，現有埋藏量一，九五〇，〇〇〇噸。（三）鑛質：以赤鐵鑛爲主，碌鐵鑛副之，平均成份約在百之六四，其他有害成份，如硫鑛銅等，含量極微，爲我國最優者。（四）採鑛方法：（A）衝裝機，每隔三公尺衝一眼孔，眼孔深九公尺起，至二十公尺，每眼可炸鑛量約三千公噸。（B）鑛室爆炸。（C）風鑽採取：計現有B74型風鑽機及B39型風鑽機。（五）採鑛紀錄：據過去用衝裝機及鑛室爆炸法，每工可採20-6萬噸，每噸耗炸藥0-18，如用風鑽機採，則每工僅能採　五噸，耗炸藥爲0-35磅。（六）處理礦砂程序：礦山之每一層面，用人工裝車送到各層面直井口，再送至地下總運輸道，帶運機一萬噸，鑛倉裝鑛卡，（每次可裝十五卡需時二十公分），由鑛卡載運經十一·八公里之鐵道，安遊鑛倉帶運機裝船。（每一小時能裝鑛四百噸至七百噸）。海南鐵鑛局，旅云年　英商　　公司答　合約，售價每噸美金七元，由去年二月起，由招商局承運至年終，共運出鑛砂二十九萬三千零八十三噸點三五，第一批合約二十五萬噸，已於卅七年一月中旬裝完，繼續簽訂合約，至筆者執筆止，已運出四萬六千六百零一點八公噸。目前此間鐵鑛局員工，非常緊張，爲一華南工鑛事業保持了一綫生機。際此東北工鑛事業幾令部停頓，今後海南鐵鑛局，地位更佔着顯著的重要，該鐵鑛正强調瓊島鋼鐵新都」，我們希望海南鐵礦局，將積極發展，達成開發資源，建設瓊崖的目的</p>
<p>此外，瓊西之石碌鐵礦，亦爲海南鐵礦局所主辦。惟聞此地礦藏較田獨尤爲豐富，惟因治安關係，至今無法復工開採。又昌江之東方水電工程，亦非常宏偉，是瓊島唯一賓藏，過去爲海南電廠接辦。去年八月間，因電廠經費困難，奉令結束，交由鐵礦局保管。如治安無法轉佳，石碌鐵礦無法開採，則東方水電廠，只是名符其實的保管而已，要電化全瓊，則距理想尙有十萬八千里之遙矣。</p>

<p>靑自　扎穩打，向前進迫，小羅將球帶上前綫，及時塞中，高致文衝出，形成空門，劉體寅竟然拉射出界，坐失良機。至十一分鐘，伏乃堂足踝受傷下野，張仁義入內瓜代，至廿一分鐘，小羅再舉義旗，傳向左方，金祿生切入，高致文撲出，金將球挑過高致文頭頂，顧以撒竄上，從容命中，一比〇先斬一關。此後薜沛然小羅疊有發射，均未建樹，精武中塲控制得法，但難過孟義良之堅强防綫。在稀有之攻勢中，吳敬仁傳向左方，方級秋近門拉射出界，上半時結束前，黃立甫在禁區犯手球，金錄生主罰十二碼，射中橫木彈出，上半時靑白淨勝一球。</p>

<h3>磐隊勝滬警　七比一</h3>
<p>市長杯足球賽第一週另一塲，磐隊對滬警在中正公　舉行，磐隊以七比一大勝，晉入第二週。</p>
<h3>籃球聯賽　同室操戈　兩個快速部隊火併　仁餘力戰壓倒滬警</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四屆籃球聯賽，已入緊張階段，昨晚甲組滬警（卽晨友）對仁餘一戰，無異操戈同室，雙方各擁上好手，動作快速，四十分鐘火併結果，仁餘竟以四三比卅六壓倒滬警，上半時二十比十四，仁餘諸將攻守咸宜，平均發展，徐仲已尤屬生動，論功行賞，常居首席，滬警頗有慌張姿態，但仁餘罰球，失去機會不少。另塲女子組黎隊勝星華，四十比卅七，男子友誼賽東華勝紅騎，四七比卅九。各塲戰况如次：</p>
<p>黎隊勝星華　王珊撐殘局</p>
<p>女組黎隊星華一戰，第一節黎隊前鋒無孔不入，錢幽屛的背上，印着星華守將的辰膏，血紅的兩片，在那淡黃色的球衣上，更顯出鮮艷觸目。本節黎隊小將們，以十八比十三佔得優勢。第二節星華曾經努力加鞭超出，但不久黎隊收復失地，卒以廿四比廿三贏半隻球。</p>
<p>星華就是雪白化身，從前確是一個很好的球隊，老是給滬上女籃球盟主綠隊以威脅，無奈近來頗少集體練習，摸不住球。第三節卅四比廿七，還是委屈。末節星華王珊苦苦掙持殘局，投籃穩定，四十比卅五尙存一分半鐘，黎隊見勢不佳，遂用慢性消耗戰元塲，結果四十比卅七，星華痛恨，黎隊在歡。</p>
<p>友誼賽東華退紅騎</p>
<p>友誼賽東華對紅騎，雙方動作都很快速，上半時紅騎廿三，東華十八。上半時戰局動盪，迭相上下，東華投射，更有面面俱到之勢，紅騎勇則勇矣，漏洞太多，最後一分鐘，韓龍海五次犯規，祗存四人，終塲爲四七比卅九，紅騎受挫。</p>
<p>本是同根生　仁餘破滬警</p>
<p>滬警（晨友）上堪爲：王蓉生。傳其俠。史久全·何增·王伯文。對仁餘蔡金典·李　和·徐仲已。沈鵬舉。王槐庭。他們是弟兄們同室室操戈。四分鐘來去奔波，雙方各掛二分，從此仁餘　和金典紛至沓來，十分鐘時，保持一面倒七比二之局面。蔡復增一球，這一球怪極，蓉生雄標，粉刷太平，前者四次罰球，悉予虛擲，難能可貴，但仁餘阿蔡仲已接連中籃，十八比八，滬警僅賴罰球得分。自何金貴。　雄標代替了金典伯文後，並沒有什麼起色，上半時二十比十四，仁餘多六分。</p>
<p>下半時，兩軍主將伯文仲已起初大家送進兩球，伯文罰入，阿梁跟進，廿四比廿一，漸呈接近。金典換槐庭出，文彝替鵬舉，滬警金貴一球入籃，蓉生邊陲亦中，廿五比廿四超出。國政伯文新運各顯特技，廿六廿八兩度平平，何增代其俠，鵬舉代文彝，新運二次罰球全中，又以二分領前。仲已調國政，槐庭代金典，彼方金貴亦二次罰球，不容卅平手，槐庭未罰入，觀衆方惋惜。好在徐仲已補一球，新運打成卅四比卅，雙方動作愈戰愈火氣，陣錢屢動，仁餘有多次罰球沒有用心，新運的衝刺，連擲帶罰，卅七比卅一。還有四分鐘，金貴中。蓉生偸，尙差二分，肇和報復一球，多四分。最後二分鐘，金典入代肇和，金貴添滬警一分，仁餘仲已又破籃，鵬舉最後一功收塲，四三比卅六，滬警（晨友）初次敗陣。</p>

<h3>海外僑胞　醖釀　救國　運動</h3>
<p>本報記者</p>
<p>〔本報海牙十二日抗訊〕近來旅居東南亞。歐洲。美洲的愛國華僑，　於　國抗日勝利後因内亂關係，致五張之一的國際地位，大形减色，甚至爲蘇聯英美等國所奚落，考其原因，皆由於我國内戰亂不已，故人口日减國力日　，然歸底究根，乃係陷於別國「以華制輩」弱我中國之奸計與陰謀；因此認爲有亟謀超脫自拔之必要，以免長此爲人愚弄，直至國亡種滅而猶不自知。爲挽救中華之危亡，解除同胞之痛苦，維護旣得五强之一的國際地位，現正醞釀組織「全球愛國華僑救國大同盟，喚起海外各地所有僑胞，同心同力，一致奮起，呼籲和平，共救祖國。</p>
<p>茲將醞釀中之「全球愛國華僑救國大同盟」宣言（題爲「華僑與祖國）與其織組辦法探得如后：</p>
<p>中華民國</p>
<p>是我們大家的祖國，因此凡是僑居國外的中華民國國民都簡稱爲「華僑」。</p>
<p>中華民國是由國民革命所造成的，而國民革命則係國父孫中山先生所創導華僑所贊助和協成的；所以孫中山先生是中國之父，華僑是革命之母。</p>
<p>我們可以說：沒有國民革命，就不能推翻當時北方異族滿淸的統治，也不能建立現在我們大家所共有的中華民國。</p>
<p>同時，如果不是國民革命，我們也不能打倒帝國主義，掃除軍閥，收回租界，抗敗日本，取消不平等條約並使中國成爲五强之一。</p>
<p>近四十年來，每逢國民革命進展一步，我們國家的地位就增高一層，我們國內外同胞的面子也就更好看一點，大家的心情也就更愉快一點。</p>
<p>我們應問：國民革命爲什麼有這樣大的力量。能收這樣大的效果。</p>
<p>這就是因爲國父說：「國民革命的目的，是在謀中華民國國民的福利」，一求中國之目由平等」，進而實現世界大同</p>
<p>國民革命的精神，寄托於國父所創的三民主義：</p>
<p>（一）以民族主義，「驅除權虜，恢復中華」，推翻征服中國的外族統治，把中國的主權，收回到中國人的手裏，中國的領土，應完全爲中國人所有，同時主張國內各民族地位，一律平等，對於任何弱小被壓迫的民族國家，均予同情，助其解放復興。</p>
<p>（二）以民權主義敎導中國人民如何集會，如何選舉，如何罷免，如何創制，如何複決，然後制定憲法，使全國國民，彼此平等，都有自由皆可參政。</p>
<p>（三）以民生主義來平均地權，節制資本，增加衣食生產，建設房屋交通使中國富强康樂。</p>
<p>三民主義因爲是國父孫中山先生所創的主義，所以最適宜於中國，也最爲中國人民所歡迎，不但華僑贊助它，國内的同胞也多擁護它，因此，國民革命的運動，能發展得很快，有很大的成就。</p>
<p>中國抗敗日本之後，成爲世界五强之一，回憶勝利之時，國內的同胞和海外的華僑是何等的興奮與愉快，對於祖國的前途，莫不抱有無限的希望。</p>
<p>可是三年以後的中國，五强之一的國際地位祗是徒有其名，不但蘇聯早已看不起我們，就是別國現在也不把我們常做大國，這是什麽緣故呢？</p>
<p>有的人說，這是由於中國共產黨叛亂所致，有的人則說，這是由於政府無能之故。</p>
<p>但是據我們華僑看來，一切的一切，還是因爲戰後雙方上了別國「以華制華」，不戰而弱中國的大當，使我們自相殘殺，而它們坐收漁利。</p>
<p>中國同胞，彼此厮殺，殺得人口减少，國力衰弱，當然失却戰終時良好的彭彭聲譽。</p>
<p>戰後別國都埋頭建設，力圓復興，我們中國</p>
<p>抗日八年原已較任何國家爲艱苦，却還要繼之以戰亂，這不是太想不通了嗎？</p>
<p>假如近三年來國内沒有戰亂，各方能一致將所有的精壯同胞組成的軍隊，分別開赴東南西北，充實邊防，同時利用戰後剩餘資源建設凖備去收復新奮應復而未復的中國領土，中國卽可成爲名符其實的五强之一，而蘇聯與英美，也不致如今日之奚落中國了。</p>
<p>往者不可諫，來者猶可追，爲挽救祖國的危困，爲解救同胞的痛苦，爲維護旣得五强之一的國際地位，我們海外華僑應亟大聲呼籲：</p>
<p>（一）從速並卽日停止中國同胞間自相殘殺的內戰，及早超脫並竭力避免別國「以華制華」弱我中國的任何陰謀圈套。</p>
<p>（三）繼續國父救國遺志，貫澈三民主義，完成國民革命，實現以中國人之主義，治理中國事的理想，不受任何外族直接或間接的支配。</p>
<p>（三）國民革命的目的，旣在求祖國之自由平等，謀全體同胞的福利，而國民革命的就，已創立了中華民國，使中圍　爲五强之一，因此凡是直接依賴別國力量長大或是間接受別國統治的政府，都是反國民革命的政府，我們相信，國内外的同胞，必誓死予以反對。</p>
<p>華僑爲國民革命之母，對於中華民國的興亡强弱，人人有着切身的利害關係，決不能漢然無視。我們對於中華民國眞正典强的前提，認爲必須做到上述三點，否則就是自趨沒落滅亡，或甘爲別人的附庸屬國，這才是中華民族致命的傷心事，無比的大　辱。</p>
<p>海外愛國的僑胞們，讓我們大家一致聯絡起來，形成一個全球愛國華僑救國大同盟，繼着國父之後拯救危亡的祖國和我們的同胞。茲錄該大同盟組織辦法（草案）如次：</p>
<p>救國綱要</p>
<p>（一）呼籲國共雙方卽日停止中國同胞間自相殘殺的戰亂，及早超脫並竭力避免任何一國「以華制華」，弱我中國的陰謀圈套。（二）繼續國父救國遺志，貫澈三民主義完成國民革命，實現以中國人之主義，治理中國事的理慈，不受任何外族　　　問變的支配。（三）國民革命的目的，旣在求中國之自由平等謀全體同胞的福利，而　民革命的成就，曾推翻滿淸，建立民國，掃除軍閥，打倒帝國主義，收回租界，抗敗日本，取消以往不平等條約，使中國成爲五强之一，因此，凡是直接依賴別國力量長大的，或是間接受制於別國的政府，都是反國民革命的政府，自爲我國內外同胞誓死所反對。</p>
<p>組織情形</p>
<p>（一）定名：全球愛國華僑救國大同盟。</p>
<p>（二）系統：大同明之下，於各大洲及華僑人數較多之國家，設救國總會，總會之下，爲支會，支會之下爲分會，或小組，小組或分會由會員三人以上組成之。</p>
<p>（三）會員；凡希望中華民國自主富强的愛國華僑贊同本大同盟救國鋼要的，在同一地區或同一城市有三人以上時，卽可依照國父民權初步規定，自動成立救國小組或救國分會。（必要時可秘密進行）</p>
<p>（四）一國之內，數個城市的救國分會，可互相聯絡，合組救國支會。</p>
<p>（五）集數個之救國支會，得組織救國總會。</p>
<p>（六）救國總會，由各國或各地支會遇出代表會商組成之，不得已時得藉通訊方法商定組成之。</p>
<p>（七）本大同盟志在救國並使中華民族較現時更爲興强進步，故其範圍，不限於一地一國或一洲，遍及全球。</p>
<p>爲便於聯絡呼應，彼此協助起見，擬設</p>

<h3>長江的吞吐舌——崇明</h3>
<p>— 秋陽</p>
<p>〔崇明十穴日訊〕如果說長江是中國的出納口，那麽崇明就是長江的吞吐舌。這個小島的歷史雖不很久，但它在地理上的位置頗爲重要，它可以說是中國的大門，可惜無險可恃，是一塊冲積平原，但是如果中國有張大的海軍，這裏還不失爲一個良港。</p>
<p>無崇不成台</p>
<p>崇明全縣人口，據官方統計，約四十六萬。出產以米，豆及棉花爲大宗，但食糧尙不敷二三個月之用，究竟如何，因無確實統計，無法推斷。由於糧食不足，此地居民大多向外發展，也許是地理上靠近上海的關係，所以他們的職業大都集中於航海。電訊和紡織。招商局每一條船都有着崇明的水手，「無崇不成台」，可見崇明人在這方面的發展了。</p>
<p>堡鎭最繁榮</p>
<p>崇明島東西長約一百八十餘里，南北最闊三十餘里，島上無山，但每隔三里有一條小河，商業以堡鎭最爲繁榮，其次爲橋鎭，崇明城裏的商業非常冷落蕭條，除了幾家米店和老虎灶外，幾乎看不到一家像樣的商店，因爲氣候的關係，這裏的住宅和商店多爲平房，最高者不過四層。</p>
<p>文化水準低</p>
<p>値得懷疑的是：這裏的交通本很便利，但文化事業，則頗爲落後，報紙有三家，都是小型的八開新聞紙，編排印刷都似乎够不上水準。圖書館所藏書籍，多爲過了時的東西，和行政院新聞局的宣傳品，沒有書店，也沒有派報社，在這裏要想看一份想要看的報紙和雜誌都非常困難，一份上海報，報販索價奇昂，甚至較滬價高出一倍以上。</p>
<p>「小國寡民」</p>
<p>但是，這裏的文化水凖，似乎比大陸並無遜色，這裏中學有十餘所，一般的說民衆的知識水凖並不算低，這裏民間大都有藏書風氣。民風淳樸，和他們接觸，有的只是眞誠，沒有絲毫做作，住在這裏好備回到一小國寡民」的社會，眞不知今世何世，大有世外桃源的味道，雖然這裏是兩種勢力鬥爭最尖端。</p>
<p>古稀的聖賢</p>
<p>到過崇明的人，大槪都會曉得這裏有兩位「聖賢」，爲着好奇，我會一訪聖賢之家，他們的家靠近城西，竹籬深處，隱現着數間瓦屋，「門雖設而常關」，兩位老先生都是七十開外的人物，他們都經常在外，過去的行徑雖有不同，但現在他們都「一個蒲團一盞燈」，以養天年。他們一個住在蘇州放生池，一個住在崇明鄕間。李覺吾先生從前是一個軍人，在北洋軍閥時代當過營長，齊魯之戰曾建奇勛，但也正因如此，他好像做了一個黃梁夢，眼看到許多親愛的弟兄在衝殺中消失，人家的弟兄也一個個倒下，這時他覺悟了，爲什麽自已的同胞要如此互相殘殺，從這時起，他就脫離軍隊，重證善果，更名「一覺」，號「覺吾」，從他的名字，我們不難看出李老先生思想的轉變，這一轉變是李老先生人格道德的分水嶺，也是李老先生被譽爲聖賢之一的一大原因。</p>
<p>革命的先進</p>
<p>蔡申甫先生是革命先進，早歲留日，追隨中山先生，從事秘密活動，在腐化無能的淸廷專制勢力範圍下，常常召開秘密會議，訓練黨員，對革命貢獻很大。性情耿介，有古義俠風。抗戰時，日本佔領崇明縣城，蔡老先生卽住鄉間別墅，在日軍離開崇明以前，迄未入城，其愛國有如此者。先生性倜儻，不事家人生產，某歲購彩票，中獎得巨資，但旋卽散盡。據說其夫人僅得八元，公爾忘私，於此可見。先生雖年逾古稀，但情神　鑠，常步行數十里不倦。兩位先生現在都茹素念佛，他們對人生似乎都看透了，然而也是因爲他們對人生問題得不到眞實的解答。</p>
<p>自吹衝鋒號</p>
<p>李先生二公子於抗戰時在歸德陣亡，據說李公子這時是一個營長，該營號兵陣亡，李公子自吹衝鋒號，因以殉國，其英勇精神也很値得欽佩！</p>
<p>長江的水滾滾地向茫無邊際的海濱流去，崇明境淳樸的人們也在不息的時間長流中恬靜地屹立着。祝福崇明島永恒地能像這樣過着寗靜和諧的生活。</p>
<h3>蔣總統在奉　服觀平劇</h3>
<p>全體觀衆起立致敬</p>
<p>〔本報奉化十八日訊〕本月十七日晚，溪口武嶺學校大禮堂公演平劇，節目有「打城隍」，「春香閙學」，「春秋配」，「定軍山」。八時正，蔣總統驅車至。當入塲時，全體觀衆千餘人起立致敬，蔣總統以愉快的精神，脫帽頻頻點頭，並速聲說「好…」。至演畢，觀衆仍如前羣起肅立，俟蔣總統步出塲外後，始魚貫而散。</p>
<h3>龍山縣議長　田和中慘案　洗雪沉寃　弱婦女報仇　人槍數百進行激戰</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙廿日電〕龍山縣參會議長兼縣黨部書記長田和中，去年被自衛分隊長向天壽慘殺一案，經半載餘，兇手雖經拘押，迄未懲辨。田有女名光楣，攻讀長沙湖大，痛父慘死，沉寃未雪，於寒假返里，邀集田姓族人槍數百，爲父報仇。頃據龍山來人談，械鬥已有半月，仍激烈進行中。</p>
<h3>杭州閘口　汲水站　機械灌溉　受益農地面積　可達十萬市畝</h3>
<p>〔中央社十九日訊〕善後事業委員會機械農墾管理處，於去年十一月曾與湖南及江西省府合作，分別舉辦洞庭湖及鄱陽湖機械排水工程，總計受益面積達二十六萬畝。現該處爲充分運用已有之抽水機起見，本年一月又與浙江省府簽訂合約，舉辦杭州閘口汲水站機械灌溉工程，按該汲水機站，原設於杭州閘口大通橋外之錢塘江北岸分第一第二兩站，同以汲取錢塘江退潮時之淡水，經杭市中河（長一一，五公里）後，注入上塘河（長四六，七公里）及筧橋河，（長一四，七公里），以灌溉杭市，杭縣及海寗等市縣，沿河十萬餘畝農田之用。在抗戰期中，二汲水站同遭摧毀，致上塘，筧橋等河，水源斷絕，稍有旱象，沿河農民，卽有乏水之虞。民廿三年及卅六年秋季，浙省吿旱，農田被災，卽以此區最爲嚴重。爲减除旱災計，上述汲水站亟應恢復以利濯溉。現擬進行之汲水站機械灌溉工程改兩站爲一站，以符經濟原則。該項工程計劃分爲二部：（一）機械部份——由農墾處提供十一吋螺漿式抽水機九套，（連同克來斯霄（Cbrysler）型六十匹馬力柴油引擎及必需附件），全部運用時，預計每分鐘，可汲水四萬五千加侖。（二）土木部份擬擬在第一汲水站原址附近，建造房屋一座面積一六八〇平房呎，下設鋼筋混凝土之蓄水池，與堤外之引水管溝通，水池以上設20Y20呎鋼筋混凝大井洞十口，頂部蓋板，架設抽水機九架。餘下一井，供工人上下檢査之用，內設扶梯及閘門，汲水站與內河之間，另挖出小溝以連接之。以上各項工程，估計共需美金四六·〇〇〇元，折合稻穀一八·四〇〇市石。其中機械設備，需稻穀一〇·七六〇市石，出水設備，爲稻穀四，四〇〇市石，廠房需稻穀一，六四〇市石，預備費需稻穀一，六〇〇市石。此項經費，由沿河有關市縣組設上塘河水利參事會負責，向受益田畝征收工程收益費，八年歸償。抽水機及引擎，在辦理灌溉工程一年後，設法轉移於受益之農民團體，耀續使用。該項灌溉工程，定本年三月底前完成，俾可不誤農時，完工以後，卽移交上塘河水利參事會接收，負責管理使用與保養，預計汲水站汲水之水量，可供上塘河及筧橋河兩岸十萬市畝農田灌溉之需，自後卽可無旱災之處，稻作生產，卽可穩定，且以時灌溉，尙有增產效果。茲以每年每畝平均增產五市斗計，每年可增產五萬市石，約合全部工程費之三倍，平時尙可利用該站之動力設備，作晨產加工之用。此外，對杭市城河排除穢水之問題，亦可連帶解決，對都市衛生，裨益非淺。</p>

<p>〔本報成都十七日航訊〕連朝春雨，乍暖還寒，十四日傍晚，蓉郊鳳凰山飛機塲，臨時冠蓋雲集，歡迎新任渝綏署主任張羣。這位西南時局中心人物，甫下飛機的第一感觸，卽是面對如此衆多的熱切期待面孔；的確，大局在轉變，西南成爲國家安定重心，張氏此番重綰疆政，任務愈艱鉅，桑梓對他的期望愈增高。爲了答報地方盛情，他破例地在兩次公開集會上，發表受命後首次對西南問題的談話。</p>
<p>精誠團結準備應變</p>
<p>當前西南情勢，張氏認爲「根本不是處常而在應變，應變之方，首要西南五省市精誠團結，惟有團結，始有力量，才足以自保。」渠詳述自訓政結束，卽以在野之身，週訪西南華北一帶，並赴日本一行，頗想致力亞細亞經濟集團組織工作。但「時局遞變，國事艱危，中央授予綏靖西南使命，雖慄於任務艱鉅，惟本敬恭桑梓之義，不能不毅然受命，返川與地方人士共渡艱苦，共謀自救救國。」並引歐陽修是江西人，未葬故鄉以招物議。「今天西南是國家最後堡壘，惟有團結合作，方可以談建國復興，至於和戰大計，當然決於中央，地方決不容有另外打算，實無「自主」之理，祗有「自力」「自給」，才是安定西南，復興國家唯一良策。」</p>
<p>坦白認錯　澈底改革</p>
<p>今日國勢，嚴重困危，釀成危機原因，張氏認爲「不能單說軍事失敗，而略去政治經濟原因；例如共產黨的成就，並不是共產主義本身健全，或是共產黨特別有能力的問題，而是國父的三民主義，尤其是民生主義到今天尙未實行的關係。」「如果我們老早實行民生主義的平均地權與節制資本，局勢何至於此！」要救國家，渠以爲：「我們應該坦白承認錯誤，澈底除舊佈新，作全面的澈底的革新。」渠過去主川，揭　「在建設中求安定，在安定中求進步」兩句口號；「今天是非常時期，決不能爲求暫時安定，以致於遷就事實，聯絡感情，敷衍人事，這種擱「平」政策現在已行不通，當前唯一的需要是「澈底」，澈底的變，澈底覺悟，澈底反省，澈底改革！」</p>
<p>自我清算　發揮民力</p>
<p>至於怎樣革新？張氏提出警覺性的口號：「我們要自己淸算自己，不要等待人家來淸算我們，而淸算不僅對財富一方面說，我們要淸算我們的思想，力量以及一切生活習慣」全面改革辦法，張氏認爲：「改革之道，千頭萬緒，推動中心力量，厥惟團結人民，要使西南各省市人民與政府密切合作，政府根據人民意思施政，表現民意，運用民力」。對政治經濟軍事方面，渠以爲：「財政幣制，地方仰給中央，絕對不能獨立。以西南爲例，如四川收回中央我收，尙可以平衡財政收支，但康滇黔渝卽做不到，故經濟的改革，應斟酌環境，硏究計劃作通盤性打算。政治與軍事，兩者息息相關，改革之道，當不外發揮民力，增加生產，澄淸吏治，組訓地方」。</p>
<p>綜計張學留蓉三日，發表公開談話兩次，從他的談話裏，看出他對安定西南的堅定信念，這也是西南人當前切要的希望。</p>

<h3>黃旭初　千里歸來　談時局</h3>
<p>〔本報桂林十四日航訊〕正當和平空氣高漲廣西謠言偏多的時候，省府主席黃旭初悄然飛漢，晉京轉穗，作了一次環繞江南半壁的行程，此行任務，自屬非常。</p>
<p>本月三日，黃氏應華中白總司令邀離桂，至十二日返抵省垣，一路風塵僕僕，下機後，卽驅車回省府主持省務會議，會後不久，自總司令卽通話詢問穗行結果，直到晚上，才能接見記者。這是他幾年來最忙碌的一遭。渠對此行所見所聞，甚感愉快。他說：京都人心安定，已無過去混亂情形，李代總統奔走和平，乃遵循蔣總統文吿昭示而努力進行者，人民需要和平，政府需要和平，共黨也需要和平，人人企求和平，和平前途是很樂觀的。但是和平並不是空談，更不需要局部和平，說到這裏，他引北平爲鑑，本市某大學某敎授女公子，在平某大學念書，在共軍將入北平時，曾來信這樣說：「我們的光明自由日子快到了。」共軍入城以後，却來信說：寫信給她的時候不可談及政治問題，可見局部和平並不是眞正的和平。</p>
<p>他又說：局勢嚴重，大家必須國結不懈，才能和得了。徐蚌會戰，共軍傷亡慘重，以後北撤，實係圖謀整補，本省應付時勢，本年工作重心與去年無異，「加强組訓，確保治安」，仍爲第一課題，所以他宣佈：戒嚴令雖解除，而妨碍洽安之行動仍在禁止之列。</p>
<p>最後他闢謠說：「外間很多謠言，說廣西獨立，廣東要來打廣西，本人（指黃氏）此次抵穗會見奧省薛主席，主客相歡，並無異言，本省一切措施，完全聽命於中央。」他駁斥謠言純係無稽之談。黃氏此行在行政上有何收穫，現在不得而知，而在澄淸謠言方面，確已得到了意外的效果</p>

<h3>Acting President Li Visits Guangzhou for Inspection, Addresses Ministry Personnel Before Departing for Guilin, to Return to Nanjing Soon for Important Meetings, Inviting Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Others to Participate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Acting President Li departed Nanjing at 9:00 AM on the 20th aboard the special plane "Sino-American," for his first southern tour after taking office. Gan Jiehou, Cheng Siyuan, Qiu Changwei, Huang Xuecun, Li Yuqing, and others accompanied him. Vice Minister Ye Gongchao and Deputy Chief Zhang Shouhsien also flew to Guangzhou on the same plane. News of Acting President Li's flight to Guangzhou was known to very few beforehand; only Huang Shaohong and a few others went to the airport to see him off. In addition to inspections in Guangzhou, the Acting President will also urge President Sun and the heads of various executive Yuan departments to return to Nanjing. He will also hold talks with legislators in Guangzhou and is expected to return to Nanjing in one or two days.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 20th] Acting President Li arrived at Tianhe Airport at 12:55 PM on the 20th, having flown from Nanjing aboard the special plane "Sino-American." Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Chen Jitang, Yu Hanmou, Zhang Fakui, Xue Yue, Ouyang Ju, Zheng Yanfen, the heads of various central ministries and departments, officials from Guangdong and Guangzhou, US Consul General Newton, US Minister Clark, and over fifty others personally went to the airport to welcome him. Acting President Li was dressed in a dark velvet suit with subtle white stripes, looking energetic and smiling warmly. Upon disembarking, he first shook hands with President Sun, repeatedly saying, "I've kept you waiting for two hours." The welcomers immediately greeted him with enthusiastic drumming. When Acting President Li shook hands with Mr. Chen Jitang, he showed particular warmth. He then inspected the honor guard amidst the melodious military music and posed for a photo with President Sun, Yu Hanmou, and Mayor Ouyang, before boarding vehicle number "〇〇一八九二," accompanied by President Sun and others, to rest at Chairman Xue's official residence.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 20th] In the afternoon of the 20th, Acting President Li received General Zhang Fakui, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and Deng Guang, concurrently Director of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, at the headquarters. At 5:00 PM, he attended a banquet hosted by President Sun. It was decided that he would attend an expanded memorial week ceremony on the morning of the 21st, and give instructions to the heads of various ministries. Afterwards, he would visit the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs at Huanghuagang. He would attend a luncheon hosted by Chairman Xue, and it was decided that he would fly from Guangzhou to Guilin on the afternoon of the 21st, then transfer via Changsha and Wuhan for inspections before returning to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] It is learned that Acting President Li will soon convene a meeting of military and political leaders in Nanjing, which is closely related to the current overall situation. As of the 20th, it is known that Acting President Li is personally going to Guangzhou to invite President Sun Ke and important leaders from the Executive Yuan to return to Nanjing. He has also telegraphed Zhang Qun in Chongqing, hoping he will come to Nanjing immediately to discuss important matters together. The "Zhuiyun" special plane, which took Xishan back to Jin on the 20th, flew directly to Lanzhou after arriving in Bing, reportedly to pick up Zhang Zhizhong to come to Nanjing. Unless there are other changes, Acting President Li, Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and others are all expected to arrive in Nanjing separately within two or three days, so that they can quickly confer with He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, and others waiting in Nanjing. It is also learned that the important meeting to be convened by Acting President Li will not change his consistent policy of peace. However, in order to promote overall peace, the government must be united internally. The meeting will address possible disagreements and unify opinions from all sides to achieve a comprehensive solution.</p>
<h3>Delivers Speech at Airport, Hoping Compatriots Assist in Achieving Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 20th] Acting President Li delivered a speech at the airport, saying: "Guangdong is the birthplace of the Chinese National Revolution and has made great contributions to the revolution. I have been away from Guangdong for many years, and I am very pleased to be able to meet with the elders and old friends of Guangdong on this inspection tour. Guangdong has suffered from years of war, famine, and poverty, and the people have suffered deeply. Although the central government has provided relief, it is only a drop in the bucket and has not been able to alleviate the people's suffering. This is something I deeply regret. Unfortunately, after eight years of war against Japan, China has been followed by three years of civil war, and the suffering of the people has reached an unbearable level. Ending the war and seeking peace is the unanimous desire of the nation. Therefore, from the day I took office, I have acted with the utmost sincerity to achieve overall peace. Now that the people of the whole country unanimously advocate eliminating the scourge of war, continuing the war is against the will of the people. Therefore, I am not only willing to make the greatest efforts for peace, but also have unlimited confidence in the inevitable realization of peace. I also believe that in today's situation where compatriots across the country are trapped in dire straits, any party must accept the peace demands of the majority of the people, otherwise, popular resentment will accumulate and lead to failure. I sincerely hope that compatriots across the country will rise up together for their own happiness, assist the government, and achieve the realization of peace. The urgent need for political reform in China today, and the need to eliminate corruption, are the urgent tasks of the government and necessary measures to alleviate the suffering of the people and improve administrative efficiency. I have already made a sincere statement in a broadcast address to military and government personnel across the country a few days ago. The government will resolutely work in this direction in the future, in order to live up to the earnest expectations of compatriots across the country. I will leave Guangdong in a few days and return to Nanjing after inspecting various places. I sincerely hope that compatriots in Guangdong will submit their opinions on promoting peace and reforming politics at any time. I and my colleagues in the government will certainly be happy to accept them."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th] Wu Tiecheng, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, changed his plans to fly north due to Acting President Li's visit to Guangzhou on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Air Transport of Grain to Taiyuan to be Strengthened, Yan Xishan's Special Plane Returns to Bing, He Yingqin Returns to Nanjing for Long Talks with Bai Chongxi</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Director Yan Xishan came to Nanjing to discuss the overall situation and the air transport of grain to Taiyuan. After staying in Nanjing for five days, he departed Nanjing at 11:30 AM on the 20th aboard the special plane "Zhuiyun" to return to Bing. Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief Guo Chan, and ten fellow legislators and supervisors from Shanxi province went to the airport to see him off. Before leaving Nanjing, Yan visited Bai Chongxi, Tong Guanxian, Tang Enbo, and others. Mr. Chuan Jingbo, advisor to US Ambassador Stuart, also visited Yan at the Capital Hotel on the morning of the 20th before his departure for a discussion lasting several tens of minutes. Before departing, Yan told reporters at the airport that the discussions with Acting President Li and other leaders on the air transport of grain to Taiyuan had yielded satisfactory results, and that the air transport of grain to Taiyuan would be strengthened in the future. Qingdao is an important base for transporting grain to Taiyuan, and grain will continue to be shipped from Qingdao in the future.</p>
<p>[Local News] General He Yingqin arrived in Shanghai at 6:00 PM on the 19th aboard the special plane "Ziqiang" from Nanjing. Jiang Dingwen and Peng Zhaoxian came with him. On the morning of the 20th, He went to the National Defense Medical College to check on the previous surgery wound and returned to Nanjing on the same plane at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] He Yingqin flew to Shanghai on the special plane "Ziqiang" on the 19th and flew back to Nanjing on the same plane at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th. He's wife and Liu Fei accompanied him. Bai Chongxi, Huang Shaohong, Leng Xin, and others went to the airport to welcome him.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Bai Chongxi did not go out on the morning of the 20th after arriving in Nanjing. Yan Xishan, Gu Zhutong, Xu Kan, Liu Gongyun, Qin Dechun, and others visited him. In the afternoon, he went to the airport to welcome He Yingqin. At 7:00 PM, he attended a banquet hosted by representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party stationed in Nanjing, and at 8:00 PM, he visited He Yingqin, who had returned to Nanjing from Shanghai that afternoon, for a long talk. Bai will stay in Nanjing for a few days and leave for his post after Acting President Li returns to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Liu Wenhui Issues Solemn Statement, Rumors of Kang Troops Entering Sichuan are False</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] Regarding the recent rumors that Xikang troops were moving to Chengdu, Liu Wenhui, Chairman of Xikang Province, recently issued a solemn statement here, as follows: "The so-called Xikang troops, namely the 24th Army of the Army, are national troops and not local troops. They have been stationed in Sichuan's Mingshan, Qiong Lai, Mujiang, Shuangliu, and the Chengdu-Ya'an Road for more than ten years. Recently, due to picking up military supplies in Chengdu, two divisions of the Shuangliu troops, originally stationed 40 miles from Chengdu, were deployed to Wuhou Temple outside the South Gate of Chengdu, which was ordinary and not worthy of anyone's attention. Unexpectedly, it has recently been cited as news material. According to yesterday's (19th) Dagong Evening News, the newly appointed Mayor of Hankou, Yan Xunfu, said at a press conference: 'Amidst the current peace talks, the chairman of a certain province in the southwest dared to send troops to attack Chengdu.' This bizarre news, if known to the 700,000 citizens of Chengdu, would surely be regarded as a baseless myth. Rumors are a special product of turbulent times. The creators have ulterior motives, and those who unintentionally promote them spread falsehoods, further introducing the rumors into the realm of mythology, which may be an achievement that the creators never dreamed of."</p>
<h3>Xia Wei Flies to Hankou</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 20th] Anhui Chairman and Commander of a certain Army Corps Xia Wei, flew from Anhui to Hankou on the morning of the 19th to report to the Central China authorities. Because Commander-in-Chief Bai flew to Nanjing on official business, they did not have much time to talk. It is heard that Xia visited Li Pinsian this morning and is scheduled to fly back to his post within the day.</p>
<h3>Zhong Tianxin Arrives in Nanjing from Shanghai, Declines to Disclose Details of Talks in Hong Kong, But Says Confidence in Peace Talks Prospects has Increased</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Zhong Tianxin, Minister of Water Resources and government peace talk representative, who flew to Shanghai from Guangzhou on the 19th, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the 20th aboard the Ziqiang plane. Zuo Gong, Deputy Secretary-General of the government delegation, came to Nanjing on the same plane. Zhong was ordered by President Sun to report to Acting President Li on the talks with CCP personnel in Hong Kong. Because Acting President Li had already left Nanjing for Guangzhou on the morning of the 20th, Zhong will wait in Nanjing to meet him. The date of his return to Guangzhou is undetermined.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] After arriving in Nanjing from Shanghai, Zhong Tianxin immediately visited Ju Zheng and Yu Youren, and is scheduled to meet with Tong Guanxian, Bai Chongxi, and others on the 21st. According to Zhong's statement to reporters on the evening of the 20th, his visit to Nanjing from Guangzhou was partly to report to Acting President Li on the negotiations with CCP representatives in South China during this trip to Hong Kong. It was also on behalf of President Sun to ask Acting President Li for instructions on the partial reorganization of several ministries of the Executive Yuan (such as the Ministries of Social Affairs, Communications, Agriculture, and Forestry) due to the resignations of the heads. Upon arrival in Shanghai, he learned that Acting President Li had decided to fly to Guangzhou. Now that Acting President Li is already in Guangzhou, President Sun can discuss everything with the Acting President in person. When asked about the gains and observations of his trip to Hong Kong, Zhong said: "Since returning from Hong Kong, I have gained some confidence in the prospects for peace talks. However, due to restrictions, I cannot disclose the content of the talks. What I can say is that the CCP representatives in South China explained the eight conditions, and I, in my personal capacity, explained the government's view on the eight articles. I raised some opinions and asked the CCP representatives in South China to relay them, which they agreed to do." Zhong also solemnly declared: "The rumors that President Sun advocates war are purely misunderstandings. When the Executive Yuan moved to Guangzhou, President Sun telegraphed the provincial and municipal governments, expressing his intention to continue promoting overall peace."</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Communist Party Official Denies Contact with Zhong</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 19th] Sources close to the "United Front" emphasize that the Communist Party and its allies aim to shorten the civil war through peace talks, but will never abandon Mao Zedong's goal of eight conditions proposed on January 14, and demand the dissolution of the Kuomintang government and its various organizations. The Communist Party will, in any case, advance south of the Yangtze River, eliminate the remnants of feudal rule, and establish a democratic government throughout China. It also stated that the Beijing-Shanghai peace delegation that recently arrived in Peiping is only regarded by the Communist authorities as representatives of the two places, expressing the opinions of the local people, and not as negotiators representing the Kuomintang government. Furthermore, a Hong Kong Communist Party official strictly denies the rumors circulating in Hong Kong and Guangzhou that Zhong Tianxin, representative of Sun Ke, recently went to Hong Kong to contact Communist Party representatives in an attempt to start peace talks.</p>
<h3>Wu Yuhou and Others to Go to Hong Kong Today to Meet with CCP Officials</h3>
<p>Yesterday Met with Acting President Li and Others in Guangzhou</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, Daily] Wu Yuhou and others from the People's Peace Delegation met with Acting President Li and President Sun at 3:00 PM on the 20th. Wu and the other two are scheduled to fly to Hong Kong at 10:00 AM on the 21st to meet with the CCP's South China officials to discuss concrete ways to promote peace.</p>
<h3>Gan Provincial Assembly Appeals for Unity</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 20th] The Gansu Provincial Assembly recently telegraphed the Presidential Palace, Executive Yuan, and Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, appealing for sincere unity to jointly plan the country's affairs. The Gansu Provincial Peace Promotion Association is also preparing to be established.</p>
<h3>Twice Declining Peace Talks Representative, Zhang Zhizhong Explains Reasons, One Person Cannot Carry Two Burdens</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 20th] At a gathering of cultural figures on the 20th, General Zhang Zhizhong explained why he had recently twice declined Acting President Li's invitation to be a peace talks representative. One person cannot carry two burdens. The so-called two burdens are: one is that both Nanjing and Guangzhou have telegraphed him to go and discuss national affairs, and the other is that he is dedicated to the stability and progress of the Northwest and cannot take care of both. He sought the opinions of the attendees, who hoped that Zhang should still strive for overall peace when peace is indeed possible, in order to achieve complete success.</p>
<p>Reform Northwest, Unite Hui and Han</p>
<p>Zhang continued to explain the political reform of the Northwest. Regarding the collapsing economic situation, he had already agreed on comprehensive remedial measures. The main purpose of the emergency economic plan is to seek self-reliance, but in the course of implementation, due to the barren land and poor people in the Northwest, the conditions are insufficient, and the central government still needs to assist. Personnel will be sent to Nanjing in the coming days to discuss the matter. As for land reform, property tax collection, and land value-added tax, it is not that there is no way, but the reason for the delay in implementation is that local bullies and gentry are obstructing it. All democratic political measures need to be passed by local public opinion institutions, but today's people's representatives are not completely representative of public opinion, which is something we should reflect on. He warned: "The tide of the democratic era is approaching, and everything that violates the trend of the era will be eliminated." Zhang pointed out the unique Hui-Han problem in the Northwest, which is a vicious political conspiracy of the Qing government. We should not be deceived by the mistakes of history. Based on the correct instructions of the Three Principles of the People's nationalism policy, ethnic groups should love each other like brothers and sisters and should no longer have prejudices and suspicions. Therefore, we should fundamentally eliminate the erroneous and sinful Hui-Han differences in thought and unite the Northwest, stabilize peace, and create freedom and happiness to lay a permanent and unshakable foundation.</p>
<p>Ma Hongkui Advocates Quick Action</p>
<p>General Ma Hongkui then gave a speech. He advocated that social reform should be carried out with the means of quickly cutting through tangled hemp, without any scruples. Regarding the Han-Hui issue, he, in his capacity as township chief, hoped that the attending religious figures would pay more attention to and explain it, and must not repeat the mistakes of history.</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Assembly Standing Committee Cables, Requesting Confiscation of Tycoon Capital</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 20th] The Standing Committee of the Hubei Provincial Assembly recently decided to respond to the proposal of the Yunnan Provincial Assembly and telegraphed Acting President Li, requesting the confiscation of tycoon capital, starting with the Kong and Song families.</p>
<h3>National Army Decides to Hold on to Qingdao, Plan to Abandon is Cancelled</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Shandong legislator declared today that the government's original plan to abandon Qingdao has now been cancelled, and approximately 60,000 National Army troops will continue to be stationed there. Qin Dechun, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government and Mayor of Qingdao, will personally go to Qingdao to command the defense.</p>
<h3>Using Central Bank's Stock of Gold and Silver to Curb Inflation, New Economic Plan Approved by Acting President Li</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 20th] It was revealed here on the 20th that Acting President Li has approved the new economic measures drafted by Finance Minister Xu Kan. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance denied that gold yuan coins would be minted, but admitted that the new economic measures include: (1) Free trading of gold, silver, and foreign currency, (2) Reducing the amount of gold yuan notes issued, (3) Free circulation of silver coins, (4) The Central Bank's stock of metals will be used entirely to curb inflation, (5) Issuing short-term US dollar bonds.</p>
<p>[Local News] Liu Gongyun, Governor of the Central Bank, recently went to Nanjing from Shanghai with Finance Minister Xu Kan and Budget Director Pang Songzhou to meet with Acting President Li, presented and requested instructions on economic reform measures. Liu has completed his official business in Nanjing and returned to Shanghai by plane at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th.</p>
<h3>ECA Announces Lifting of Ban, US Cotton to Resume Shipping to China, Lapham to go to Washington in the Next Day or Two</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] An ECA spokesman said: "The ECA has lifted the ban on shipping cotton to China." Shippers were notified on the 19th to resume shipping, and actual shipping will begin within the next week, shipping from US seaports to Shanghai.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The US$15 million of American cotton, which had been halted for over a week due to the Chinese Civil War, was ordered to resume shipping today by ECA Director Hoffman and is scheduled to be delivered in Shanghai in February and March. According to Cleveland, the Director of the China Affairs Office, the ECA is satisfied with the supply situation in Shanghai and can allow the resumption of transport. This US cotton totals about 10,000 bales. In the past, due to the unstable situation in China, the ECA did not want to have a large amount of inventory piled up, so it ordered the suspension of transport. 10,000 bales were already en route when the ban was imposed and were planned to be diverted to Japan. The ECA has assured shipping companies that it will not allow them to suffer losses under any circumstances, or the ECA will buy them back and transport them to Europe and other places. Several weeks ago, the ECA also stopped shipping wheat flour to North China because a barge at Dagukou was confiscated by the National Army during the battle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 19th] According to ECA China Division Director Lapham: "The Congressional Committee will begin discussing the ECA's future aid plan for China in Washington around March 1." Lapham arrived here yesterday from Shanghai and will stay at home for a few days. He plans to go to Washington on the 22nd or 23rd to report to Hoffman and attend the Congressional Committee to explain. Lapham is unwilling to express any opinion on the continued US aid to China before reporting to Hoffman. Local newspapers today published news of the Chinese Communist Party seizing the ECA's relief flour in Peiping. Howard's San Francisco News, in its editorial, supports the 51 Republican members of Congress who wrote to President Truman a few days ago, citing the rise of the Chinese Communist Party, and suggested that a senior officer organize a military, economic, and political committee to re-examine US policy toward China. The editorial said that the letter "is suggestive and without partisan bias." President Truman should act on this friendly suggestion and bring public attention to the situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] Former US State Department Far East Director Hobbick said in a speech at the Foreign Policy Association today: "Whether the United States can help China or not is a major question at present. Although it is late, the Nanjing government is still fighting. This is the only independent and autonomous government in all of Asia resisting the Communist advance. If the United States firmly decides to abandon China and let it run its course, it will immediately lose what it has gained in China and the Far East in the past 100 years. Europe itself will also be difficult to fully recover if it cannot obtain East Asian resources and trade with it. The more the Communist Party gains in Asia, the greater the danger of a hot war between democratic countries and the Kremlin. What we have gained in Europe will also be quickly lost and become Soviet assets. China should have the opportunity to develop into a democratic country and continue to serve as a free fortress in the Far East, which is extremely important to both China and the United States. At least there is still a chance to delay the resistance, and the United States should provide as much moral and material assistance as possible to this resistance." Columbia University professor and Far East expert Pei Fu's speech advocated the opposite.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Resumption Imminent, Urging Committee Members from Various Places to Come to Nanjing Quickly to Attend, May Travel by Plane or Train Free of Charge with Notification and Badges</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] With the resumption of the Legislative Yuan imminent in Nanjing, the Secretariat has been actively preparing for the resumption in recent days. Although the 20th was a Sunday, the Secretariat still worked as usual and officially issued a notice on the 20th, which was forwarded by the provincial and municipal governments to inform legislators in various places and urge them to come to Nanjing quickly to register before the meeting. Regarding the means of transportation for legislators to come to Nanjing, the Legislative Yuan has reached agreements with China and Central Aviation Companies and various railway bureaus. Legislators can travel free of charge by plane or train with a meeting notice and badge. The ticket fee will be paid by the Legislative Yuan Secretariat in Nanjing. In places without planes or trains, the provincial and municipal governments are requested to facilitate transportation on the spot. In addition, the staff of the deliberation, document, and accounting groups of the Legislative Yuan Secretariat who have arrived in Guangzhou will also transfer some of them back to Nanjing to work.</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 20th] Regarding the location of the resumption of the Legislative Yuan, the legislators staying in Hunan recently decided to hold it in Guangzhou and have appointed Li Zongli to go to Guangzhou first to make contact. According to Mo Xuanyuan, the reasons why the Hunan legislators advocate for Guangzhou are: (1) Nanjing is close to the front line, which affects the mood of the legislators. (2) It is convenient to travel to Guangzhou. The date when Mo and others will depart depends on when the Legislative Yuan determines the resumption date. CCP Broadcasts Peiping Takeover Situation</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Looking at Japan's Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Yoshida Cabinet, the seventh cabinet in Japan after the war, was announced on the 16th of this month. As we expected, it is an extremely conservative and right-leaning dictatorial cabinet in postwar Japan. Whether in terms of personnel or policy, there is nothing new to see. In terms of personnel, the Democratic Liberal Party occupies sixteen of the eighteen seats in the cabinet, including the prime minister and ministers, making it practically a one-party government. Prime Minister Yoshida also serves as Foreign Minister, his old friend Oasa Tadao remains as Minister of Health and Welfare, and the others are third-rate figures in the political world, not worth paying attention to. In terms of policy, according to Yoshida's first statement upon forming the cabinet, it is to guarantee fighting against the Communist Party and to concentrate the national strength of Japan to accelerate economic recovery. Yoshida also promised to implement the nine principles of the US authorities' guidance for Japan's recovery, and to implement strict administrative reforms to maintain financial stability and reduce all unnecessary expenditures. As for the detailed policy program of the cabinet, it has not yet been formulated, and it will probably still follow the direction of the previous cabinet, and it is impossible to have novel and progressive performance. Japan's postwar politics have always been stagnant in the old form, which can be explained by this.</p>
<p>Can the Yoshida cabinet succeed in domestic affairs or economic policy? What impact will it have on the domestic and Far Eastern situation in Japan? There is a need for analysis and explanation. First, let's talk about anti-communism. The strength of the Communist Party in Japan is originally very weak. In the previous House of Representatives, out of 466 seats, only four were Communist Party members. The result of this general election was that 35 were elected, about nine times as many. If we calculate based on the total number of votes, out of 32 million votes nationwide, the party received more than 3.5 million votes. In other words, on average, one out of every nine Japanese voters voted for the Communist Party. The expansion of the Japanese Communist Party's power cannot be taken lightly. On the one hand, the military development of the Chinese Communist Party stimulated the Japanese people and contributed to the victory of the Japanese Communist Party and the general election. On the other hand, due to the failures of the past few cabinets in implementing policies, everything showed corruption and incompetence, creating opportunities for the development of the Japanese Communist Party. The Yoshida cabinet, with anti-communism as its duty, and with its strength and the convenience of MacArthur's support, can suppress the development of the Communist Party, which is undoubtedly certain. However, Yoshida is anti-communist with right-leaning policies and a conservative posture, without any signs of democratic progress. Whether he can stop this red tide is worth serious attention.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about economic recovery, which is an important issue for the revival of Japanese militarism today. The nine principles implemented by MacArthur last year to guide Japan are mainly aimed at guiding the recovery of old Japan. The so-called enterprise management and industrial rationalization, in fact, make the Japanese capitalist class expand its exploitation power. On the other hand, it poses the danger of an increasing number of unemployed in the Japanese working class. Such a dangerous economic policy not only revives old Japan, completely violating the principles of the Potsdam Declaration, but also has a rewarding effect on the development of the Japanese Communist Party, and even stimulates the revival of the old Japanese aggressive mania. Japanese economists unanimously agree that this economic recovery is not beneficial to the future of Japan's economic democratization, it only leads Japan to another new war, as a vanguard for the United States. Yoshida Shigeru said, "The victory in this general election is evidence that the Japanese people want the current democratic politics, sound conservatism, and the people want political security." If the majority of Japanese people think as Yoshida said, then the Japanese people psychologically need a revival of old Japan, and will not hesitate to engage in another war of aggression to revive old Japan, which will be fully demonstrated by this.</p>
<p>Based on the facts analyzed above, it shows that the emergence of the Yoshida cabinet is another success for the right-leaning conservative forces in Japan. The result of its confrontation and struggle with the Communist Party will inevitably make the polarization of Japan's political undercurrent not only unavoidable, but also increasingly acute. On the day of Yoshida's successful cabinet formation, the Japanese Communist Party declared that it would cause the Yoshida cabinet to die prematurely. It will probably use labor offensives and the shortcomings of the nine economic principles to try to disintegrate the Yoshida cabinet in many ways, or make Yoshida's policies fail, and then force the Japanese people to turn to the left. In short, the political tide in Japan will become more dangerous day by day, with confrontation between left and right parties, and division within the right-wing parties. Where the "Yoshida Maru" will run aground will have a decisive impact on Japan's polarized politics, which is worth paying close attention to.</p>
<h3>Using Foreign News Agencies: Conspirators Spreading Rumors; A Certain Person in Charge Issues a Statement Denouncing Them</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday's newspaper reported that United Press reporter Zhang Guoxing's Nanjing dispatch on the 19th stated: "President Chiang, who has temporarily retired, is still issuing orders and still retains enough presidential power to exercise a veto in future peace talks with the Communists. At the same time, he is exercising these powers daily to open the door for his reinstatement." It also stated that "President Chiang frequently issues various instructions to the Minister of National Defense and the President of the Central Bank." The reporter even stated: "Chiang's exercise of presidential power during his retirement seems to be an obstacle to Li Zongren's peace negotiations with the Communists and the implementation of radical political reforms." "Reactionaries, under Chiang's protection, are exerting their influence and power throughout the country to hinder or sabotage Li Zongren's peace efforts and prepare for Chiang's reinstatement," and so on. A Central News Agency reporter recently inquired about the opinions of a certain person in charge here regarding this telegram from Zhang Guoxing. According to him, "This is obviously a conspiracy by conspirators to use foreign news agencies and abuse the freedom of the press in government areas to deliberately spread vicious rumors, attempting to slander President Chiang's sincerity, purity, and greatness for the country, destroy his credibility, sow discord between President Chiang and Acting President Li, create a dangerous political turmoil, and deepen China's crisis. Fortunately, the methods of these conspirators are clumsy and naive, and anyone with discernment will know their intentions at a glance and will never be deceived by them."</p>

<h3>Linzhuang Village in Wuxi Robbed</h3>

<h3>The Shandong Communist Authorities Issue Customs Regulations; Ships Departing from Hong Kong Mostly Sail to Ports in Northern Shandong</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 19th] The Shandong Communist authorities have issued customs regulations stipulating the method of levying taxes on imported goods. Hong Kong has recently received many copies of these regulations, and Chinese business people are secretly circulating them. According to well-informed sources, imported goods are divided into three categories: (1) those that are completely tax-exempt upon import, such as steel, iron, trucks, and medicines; (2) those that are not essential goods, which are taxed according to their nature; and (3) goods that are prohibited from import, including many types of "luxury goods," such as perfume, stockings, and nylon stockings. According to Chinese authorities, similar customs regulations will also be issued in the Tianjin area. Trade between Hong Kong and the Communist areas previously took place via North Korea, but in the past few weeks, it has been directly trading with Shandong. Many of the ships that originally sailed to North Korea have recently changed their course to Yantai or other ports in northern Shandong. Many ships in Hong Kong will also sail to Shandong, but the destination stated on the official permits is still North Korea, because the Hong Kong authorities refuse to issue permits to sail to Communist ports. The promulgation of the Shandong customs law has deeply interested Chinese and foreign business people here. Merchants here are impatient to restore trade relations with North China. Even the most traditional British companies are trying to contact the Communists to engage in trade. Hong Kong's trade volume increased continuously in 1948, but now there are signs of decline. Imports have fallen from HK$158 million in December of last year to HK$159 million in January. Hong Kong's warehouses are full of goods. Due to the disintegration of China under the Nationalist government and the blockade of Communist-occupied areas, its outlets are becoming increasingly narrow. Therefore, restoring trade with North China can give the Hong Kong business community a new lease of life. There are varying opinions on the future of this trade. Most Chinese and foreign merchants believe that large-scale trade with North China can be restored soon. If so, the United States will be at a disadvantage, while Hong Kong and the United Kingdom will gain an advantage. However, some foreign merchants believe that Mao Zedong's recently declared trade system should be the basis for trade between the "liberated" areas and other areas, so it is not easy to develop large-scale trade relations. According to the current method for North Korea and Shandong, the goods are purchased and paid for by Chinese people in Hong Kong, and transported by specially chartered ships. At the same time, most business people here point out that the Communist Party has expressed many times that it is very interested in restoring normal trade relations with foreign countries, especially in the supply of machinery and important industrial products, because North China is in great need of these items. Many representatives of Chinese commercial companies stationed in Communist areas have recently returned to Hong Kong to purchase goods. They hope that this is a sign of the restoration of normal trade between the Communist areas and the outside world.</p>
<h3>Xu Xueyu Discusses North-South Navigation: The Main Point is to Protect Navigation Rights; The Current Exchange of Flour for Coal is a "Cautious" Move</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Xu Xueyu, general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, said on the issue of North-South navigation: "One of the important meanings of navigation lies in protecting China's inland river navigation rights. He believes that if the British company Taikoo's Hunan ship succeeds in transporting Kailuan coal to Hong Kong, then not only will Shanghai's required coal need to be purchased from foreign countries using foreign exchange, but it will also create a precedent for foreign ships to navigate China's inland rivers." He also pointed out that Hong Kong's coal consumption in the past relied on Africa, and the transportation cost was higher than Kailuan coal, indicating that the British's rapid dispatch of ships to the north also had a trade motive. Xu Xueyu believes that the current initial North-South navigation, limited to the exchange of flour for coal, is a "cautious" measure. When asked by reporters when the types of materials could be increased and passenger transportation could be added, he said: "It may be difficult to do so for the time being, and further efforts are needed." Xu came to Taiwan a few days ago and returned to Shanghai on the 20th. As a result of his talks with Chen Cheng, chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government, both parties agreed that the Bank of Taiwan would lend the Taiwan branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company NT$1 billion per month, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would purchase flour of the corresponding amount from Shanghai each month and transport it to Taiwan for repayment.</p>

<h3>European Recovery Program: America's Biggest Bargain</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington 15th Dispatch] The Christian Science Monitor published an editorial on February 12th entitled "America's Biggest Bargain," stating:</p>
<p>As Congress begins discussing the second year of the Marshall Plan, a group of reliable American observers are revisiting Europe and reporting on the changes they have seen since a year ago. Americans can also see these changes in the figures submitted to Congress by ECA Administrator Hoffman. Or they can see it in the more casual material supplied by free journalists.</p>
<p>They can compare the $4.28 billion requested by the ECA for the 1949-1950 fiscal year with the $5.055 billion for the previous fiscal year. Or they can imagine the scene in London from the newly painted steps and polished brass railings of various military stations and buildings.</p>
<p>They can take encouragement from the fact that ECA officials believe that Europe can continue to make real progress next year and that US aid can be reduced. Or they can note what US aid has meant in Britain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>As ECA Administrator Hoffman said after studying the effects of the first year of US aid: "If this plan brings us peace and stability - as I believe it will - then it will be the biggest bargain the American people have ever made."</p>
<p>As journalist Alsop wrote from London: "If good news were generally recognized as having headline value, then what has happened in London would have been the headline of American newspapers long ago. In the past year, the British people have accomplished a miracle."</p>
<p>Another reporter said: "US aid has actually brought Italy back to its feet." There is no doubt in Congress about the success of this plan. America not only needs to supply Europe with machinery and raw materials to improve their lives but also needs to supply weapons to protect this improvement. Therefore, the future problem is more complicated. The existence of this need is certainly due to the success of the economic plan. But this certainly means that American and European efforts should be divided into production measures and non-productive defense measures.</p>
<p>It is gratifying that the trend of aid to Europe has brought about a fundamental change in the European picture. Initially, most of the materials under the Marshall Plan were food and agricultural products, intended for immediate consumption, and agricultural products necessary to increase grain production. But by the autumn of last year, at least half of the materials were industrial materials, and Europe acquired new industrial equipment for production. Good harvests and increased factory output supported this plan.</p>
<p>After the end of the Marshall Plan period in 1952, the expected large-scale deficit of European dollars will somewhat diminish these advances. Similarly, Americans cannot help but feel disappointed that European governments have failed to cooperate more extensively with each other.</p>
<p>But these factors cannot become strong counter-evidence that would prevent us from carrying out this plan with all our strength. In its first year of achievement, this plan has brought us great gains. Trade within Europe will reduce Europe's dependence on the dollar, and the progress they have already made under cooperation will encourage them to cooperate further with each other.</p>

<h3>US Under Secretary of the Army Draper's Resignation Approved, Extreme Shock in Tokyo, Japanese Suspect Changes to the US Recovery Plan for Japan, MacArthur Believes the US Has an Obligation to Protect Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 20th Dispatch] The resignation of US Under Secretary of the Army Draper has caused great unease among the Japanese, who believe that Draper is the strongest advocate of the "rebuilding Japan" policy. This resignation follows closely on the heels of reports that Secretary of the Army Royal advocated a re-examination of the US military position in the Far East (later denied), so the Japanese are extremely pessimistic about Draper's departure. They cannot say for sure what advantages or disadvantages this has for Japan, but they are certain that it is absolutely unfavorable to Japan. Although Draper's resignation had been submitted to President Truman long ago, the acceptance of his resignation just as the debate over what Royal revealed at the Tokyo press conference was underway made the Japanese believe that there must be a reason behind it. Their unease stems in part from a lack of confidence in the US's overall economic recovery of Japan. Regardless of the US's military policy toward Japan, Royal and any other senior US officials have never hinted that economic aid to Japan would be stopped - if the Japanese expressed their determination to help themselves. Observers here believe that Royal and Draper have at least seen the economic needs of Japan. But Draper's resignation is particularly shocking to the Japanese. Draper's work is directly related to the occupied territories, so his departure raises the question of who will succeed him, and the Japanese are now eagerly awaiting the answer to this question.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington 19th Dispatch] The White House announced today that Under Secretary of the Army Draper will resign on the 28th of this month, and the resignation has been approved by President Truman. Draper, a Republican from the financial world, has served as Under Secretary since October 1947. He has made many plans for the occupation policies of both Japan and Germany, and his report on Japan in particular has been criticized.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 20th Dispatch] According to all indications here, General MacArthur believes that the United States now has an economic obligation to the people of Japan and at least a temporary obligation to protect Japan from aggression. MacArthur is unwilling to get involved in the "Royal Affair," but his past statements clearly show his views on the issue of US responsibility for Japan. Since MacArthur is responsible for supervising here, it is naturally believed that his opinions have an important place in the US's formulation of its policy toward Japan. MacArthur has repeatedly referred to Japan as the Allied war criminal, actually the war criminal of the US occupation forces, and has said that the United States has an obligation to take care of these criminals economically. He has said at least once that the occupation forces are responsible for ensuring Japan's security until a peace treaty is signed. He even raised the question of who would protect Japan after the signing of the peace treaty. In answering his own question, MacArthur once suggested that Japan should be guaranteed by the United Nations. In addition, he also implied that the US Air Force stationed on Okinawa could assume this responsibility.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 20th Dispatch] Occupation officials expressed their views on the 20th that US policy toward Japan will not change after Under Secretary of the Army Draper's resignation. Major General LaGart, Director of the Economic and Scientific Section of the Allied Headquarters, said that there are no signs of any changes affecting Japan.</p>
<h3>Disagreements in US Policy Toward Japan: Conflicting Opinions on Industrial Level and Reparations, the Work of the Far Eastern Commission is Hesitant and Unsure</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 20th Dispatch] According to the results of the investigation by this agency on the issue of the Far Eastern Commission, the Soviet representatives' frequent attacks are not as destructive to the function of the Far Eastern Commission as is generally imagined. People on the Far Eastern Commission who were consulted by this agency said that one of the fundamental reasons why the Far Eastern Commission cannot proceed more quickly with its work is that the US has not yet decided on a policy of what kind of industrial level should be allowed for Japan. They said that before this decision is made, the issue of reparations cannot be resolved, so the Far Eastern Commission cannot understand what its final plan should be like.</p>
<p>Soviet representative Pan Youxin's demands and public statements have led people unfamiliar with the Far Eastern Commission to believe that the Soviet strategy may be to obstruct the work of the commission. But according to the representatives consulted by this agency, the real problem is "when can the United States decide." According to people familiar with the US's difficulties, these difficulties are due to two conflicting opinions on the two issues of industry and reparations. One faction believes that all of Japan's existing industry should be left to Japan so that Japan can be economically strong and self-sufficient, while the other faction believes that Japan's industry should be dismantled to the lowest level so that the victims of Japanese aggression can receive just compensation. The representatives of the Far Eastern Commission are particularly troubled by Pan Youxin's disregard for the confidentiality of the commission's meetings and his frequent public statements. The representatives also strongly disagree with the content of Pan's statements. They feel that Pan Youxin is using the Far Eastern Commission as a propaganda ground. According to the representatives interviewed by this agency, the Soviet delegation is "very cooperative" in conducting the ordinary affairs of the commission. According to a study of recently published reports, the Far Eastern Commission announces at least one policy resolution each month that the Soviet Union also endorses, which the Soviet Union could have vetoed.</p>
<h3>Agnes Smedley Complains About the US Military Authorities</h3>
<p>Her Reputation Has Been Cleared, But It Cannot Compensate</p>
<p>[United Press New York 19th Dispatch] Writer Agnes Smedley thanked the Army Department on the 19th for "clearing her name" but said that she has suffered irreparable losses from being accused of being a Soviet spy. Her defense lawyer issued a statement on her behalf stating: "I express my gratitude to the Army Department for clearing my name from being accused of being a Soviet spy. But at the same time, I must state that the withdrawal of lies that have already gone too far, in addition to financial losses, I have suffered irreparable pain. I hope that this policy of humiliation before investigation can be ended, and that a way can be found to prevent officials from defaming loyal citizens, while they hide behind laws that cannot be sued."</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 19th Dispatch] MacArthur's official spokesperson told the United Press that MacArthur Headquarters will have "no immediate" response to the Army Department's admission in Washington that the publication of the pre-war communist spy case between China and Japan was "inappropriate." Colonel Ecker, MacArthur's new information bureau chief, did not indicate when there would be a response. He told foreign reporters at a press conference on February 11 that he was "fully responsible" for the Army Department's Sorge spy case report.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Cables the Four-Power Conference Requesting Permission to Attend and Present Arguments</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London 19th Dispatch] The Austrian Embassy in London recently submitted a note to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference on behalf of its government, announcing that when the conference hears the statement of Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Bebler on the 24th, the Austrian representative will also attend.

<h3>Bulgarian Pastors to Be Tried Next Week</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Sofia 20th Dispatch] Bulgarian Orthodox priests and Muslim imams issued a statement to the press stating that there is absolute religious freedom in Bulgaria and denouncing the crimes committed by fifteen Protestant pastors on behalf of the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press Sofia 19th Dispatch] A Bulgarian government newspaper reported that one of the fifteen Christian pastors who will be tried for treason, espionage, and black market transactions has confessed. The Fatherland Front reported that Evangelical Church pastor Yakovkov admitted to providing information to British and American intelligence personnel.

<h3>Hungary Publishes a Black Book on the Mindszenty Trial</h3>
<p>Accusing the West of Defaming the Case</p>
<p>[United Press Budapest 19th Dispatch] The Hungarian government on the 19th denied inspecting any telegrams related to the recent trial of Mindszenty.

<h3>Norwegian Labor Party Approves Government's Foreign Policy by an Overwhelming Majority, Maintaining Security Should Be Done in Cooperation With Western Countries</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Norwegian Capital 19th Dispatch] The Norwegian Labor Party held a closed-door meeting all day today, where Foreign Minister Lange reported on the negotiations with Britain and the United States on the North Atlantic Treaty. That night, a motion was passed by 329 votes to 35, approving the Labor Party government's foreign policy.</p>
<p>Norway has formally accepted the invitation from Western countries to participate in the North Atlantic Defense Treaty. There is now only one hurdle left, which is for the parliament to pass the foreign policy drafted by Lange. This matter can be voted on within the next week. At that time, all 150 members of parliament, except for the 11 communist seats, can vote in favor. The Soviet Union has warned Norway twice in three weeks not to join the North Atlantic Alliance. Norway has not yet responded to the second note. In its response to the first note, it expressed its willingness to study the possibility of a regional alliance. Recent developments show that Norway will also reject this suggestion.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Oslo 20th Dispatch] The Norwegian Labor Party National Council passed the following resolution: "The National Council believes that Norway's security on defense issues should be resolved through cooperation with Western democratic countries. This cooperation should be based on the United Nations Charter and should be purely defensive and peaceful in both practice and form."</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Conspiracy Cracked in Bolivia, President Orders National Martial Law, Leaders of the Revolutionary Movement Arrested</h3>
<p>[United Press Bolivian Capital 20th Dispatch] President Handoso has declared martial law in Bolivia. Several people suspected of being involved in the conspiracy have been arrested. The Bolivian government has also formally protested to Peru, accusing it of allowing Bolivian political exiles to operate within its borders. Handoso denounced "the extreme right-wing nationalists who were overthrown in July 1946" for plotting to overthrow the current government at home and abroad.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Bolivian Capital 20th Dispatch] The government took emergency measures today to prevent a riot scheduled for this morning by Bolivians expelled from Peru and Argentina. The ringleaders of the riot were two former Bolivian officials who are now employed by the Peruvian government. Eight leaders of the National Revolutionary Movement, who support former President Villarroel, were arrested yesterday, and other major offenders are also being hunted down.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Expresses Concern Over Nordic Trends</h3>
<p>[United Press Moscow 19th Dispatch] The Soviet "Red Fleet Newspaper" claimed on the 19th that the protest movement in Scandinavian countries against the Atlantic Pact is clearly on the rise.

The newspaper also said that US imperialism's efforts to force Norway to become an outpost for attacking the Soviet Union have been constantly opposed by the Norwegian people.</p>
<h3>Strikes Break Out One After Another, Political Situation in Italy is Unstable</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Rome 19th Dispatch] The political situation in Italy has fluctuated greatly in the past 48 hours, one reason being the strike in Isola del Liri, and another being the release of war criminal Prince Borghese, which has aroused protests from many sectors of the Italian people. The left-wing parties have criticized the police's improper handling of the strike. Subsequently, Rome staged a general strike for several hours, and several towns in the north also experienced work stoppages and demonstrations. The opposition parties are now using the new situation to try to overthrow the coalition government led by Catholic Party leader Gasperi.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Prime Minister Appeals to the United States to Expand Economic Aid to the Middle East, It Is Intolerable That British Troops Remain in Egypt</h3>
<p>[United Press Cairo 20th Dispatch] In a written statement submitted exclusively to the United Press on the 20th, Egyptian Prime Minister Hadi appealed to the United States to expand the Marshall Plan to the Middle East to help deter communism before it is too late. This is the first statement made by Hadi to a foreign journalist since succeeding Nokrashy as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Hadi said that although Egypt made many contributions to the Allies during the war, it did not receive aid under the Marshall Plan. He said, "Egypt hopes to receive the same political support and material assistance from Britain as Britain gives to Turkey, Greece, and Western Europe." I should point out that the communist crisis in the Middle East is no less serious than in other parts of Europe and Asia, and that there is always an opportunity to prevent the Middle East from the crisis of communism by providing similar economic assistance to the Middle East as to Western Europe before it is too late." Hadi said that relations between Egypt and the United States are good, but that the United States only shows its political interest in the Middle East by supporting Jews against Arabs. He said that Arabs are "the legitimate and peaceful masters of their countries." Hadi said that Anglo-Egyptian relations are "somewhat cold and stagnant" because of "the conditions that Britain is trying to impose on Egypt in the new treaty of mutual cooperation between the two countries." He said that the current British troops remaining in Egypt is intolerable, although Britain announced its intention to withdraw all troops in 1946, it has not yet been realized.</p>
<h3>New Technical Assistance Plan Can Be Implemented in Three Steps, Full Completion Requires a Century</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington 19th Dispatch] President Truman's new plan to develop economically backward countries is huge and complex. Most experts in the US and the United Nations believe that the President can only start the process, and the completion of the entire plan will take at least 30 years, or even more than 100 years. The plan is not just about opening factories or promoting new farming methods, but about advancing the entire economy and culture of each country by a century or more. The scope of the plan includes a large part of Latin America, Asia, the Far East, Africa, and the Middle East, with a total population of 1.65 billion people. The initial years will not cost much. The first step will be to recruit and train a large number of scientists, technicians, and experts as managers. The second step is to help countries formulate long-term development plans. The third step is to start investing, which is very large in scope, and there is no specific plan yet. The most urgent need for backward countries is food, but the highly agricultural production technology of the US and Western Europe cannot be realized in these areas for a while, so the best way is to promote industrial innovation and agricultural improvement at the same time. Areas that are not suitable for steelmaking cannot build steel plants, but rather build some light industrial factories, such as cloth factories, shoe factories, furniture factories, and daily necessities manufacturing plants. The establishment of such factories can improve living standards and allow farmers to work during most of their spare time during the year. This kind of "hidden unemployment" in rice-producing areas of Asia is the main reason for low living standards.</p>
<h3>Hundreds of Communists Arrested in India and Hyderabad, Indian Sikh Party Leader Also Arrested</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Bombay 19th Dispatch] Indian police today launched a massive roundup of communists across the country to prevent a strike by one million railway workers. They are all accused of plotting a railway strike. Police are now stationed on all railway bridges across the country. In addition, hundreds of people have been arrested in Hyderabad, and the state's military government has banned gatherings of more than five people, carrying weapons, displaying communist flags, or marching in processions. In New Delhi, the government announced that it had arrested Sikh Socialist Party leader Tarasing, but this has nothing to do with the prosecution of communists. Tarasing and two companions went to New Delhi to attend a religious conference. The government considered it a political gathering and arrested them at the railway station.</p>
<h3>Britain Equips Siamese Army to Prevent Communists From Infiltrating</h3>
<p>[Associated Press London 19th Dispatch] A Foreign Office spokesman said today that the British government has agreed to equip five companies of the Siamese army to strengthen national defense to prevent communists from infiltrating from other countries. This announcement comes one day after the Siamese government announced national martial law to prevent communists from infiltrating.

<h3>Bevin Calls for European Unity to Work Together to Ensure Long-Term Peace, Hopes for Early Establishment of European Parliament</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in a speech in Bristol tonight, "If Western nations and other peace-loving countries can unite now, achieve complete understanding, and harmonize their defense efforts, there will be no war for centuries." Bevin made the speech at the 15th anniversary of the "Transport and General Workers' Union," of which he had been the secretary-general for many years. Bevin continued, "If we can achieve this cooperation, instead of attending meetings and listening to the abuse we have had to listen to in the past, we can sit down and govern." Referring to the recent information received by the British Foreign Office regarding concentration camps in Eastern Europe, Bevin said that these concentration camps were as bad as Hitler's concentration camps, and it was heartbreaking that people who went in were never seen again. The British people only want any country to have the political system it desires, but we cannot be forced to do so. Any measure that hinders the freedom of human thought is a disaster for the advancement of mankind. Referring to the Atlantic Charter, Bevin said, "Our purpose is not war, we do not want to attack anyone, but we also do not want to be attacked, this is our policy. We will never become aggressors, and the United States has never been willing to take on such a heavy responsibility. I hope that the countries participating in the Charter can unite and contribute to the well-being of others." Bevin hopes that the European Parliament can be established in the coming months, "The era of the balance of power is over, and unity between countries must replace it."</p>
<h3>Bidault's Speech</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] Former Foreign Minister Bidault stated during the National Committee debate on foreign policy of the French Popular Republican Party today, "Since we cannot build Europe based on geographical boundaries, we will build Europe based on the boundaries of freedom." Bidault also said that France will do its utmost to prevent the world from being divided, "The Atlantic Charter was created due to the failure of the Moscow Conference and the Soviet Union's determination to reject the Marshall Plan. The current problem is that France should build Europe together with countries that are determined to cooperate with us according to their free will."</p>

<h3>Postal and Telecommunications Rates Adjusted from Today, Increased by Four and Five Times Respectively, Railway Bureau Has Not Received Order to Adjust Freight Rates</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Ministry of Transportation has decided to use a formula to adjust postal, telecommunications, and railway rates together, automatically adjusting them three times a month on the 1st, 11th, and 21st. Detailed calculation methods have been published on page two of yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the Shanghai Postal Administration and Telecommunications Bureau received an urgent telegram from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday afternoon, deciding to implement it from today. Postal rates will increase fourfold, including the original fivefold. Telegram and long-distance telephone fees will increase fivefold, including the original sixfold. However, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau had not received a formal order by late evening. Moreover, the bureau had newly adjusted passenger and freight rates on the 12th of this month, and the calculation of freight rates is also more complicated, so new freight rates will not be implemented today. The new postal and telecommunications rates are recorded as follows: (1) Postal rates: Ordinary letter 15 yuan, postcard (single) 7.5 yuan, express mail 45 yuan, postcard (double) 15 yuan, single registered mail 65 yuan, double registered mail 245 yuan, airmail (ordinary) 60 yuan, airmail (express) 135 yuan, airmail (registered) 110 yuan.

<h3>402 Yangtze River Navigation Markers Replaced, Lightships Lack Equipment, Lighted Buoys Rescued</h3>
<p>In order to ensure navigation safety, China's shipping industry is actively strengthening its equipment. In addition to strictly inspecting the quality of ships and limiting overloading, it is hoped that the competent authorities will provide more assistance in the installation of lighthouses and navigation marks, so that we can work together to quickly achieve success. We have specifically inquired about the actual situation of navigation markers in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River from the person in charge of the Maritime Affairs Section of the Customs General Administration, and recorded it as follows: It is reported that the navigation markers were ordered to be reinstalled after the war. By the end of the previous year, as many as 402 had been replaced, and 113 lighted piles had been restored. Electric lights are being gradually converted to replace the original kerosene lamps. Before the war, there were 51 lightships, but only 18 can be re-established now. This number is far from sufficient due to financial difficulties, which makes it impossible to add more. However, in order to do our best to remedy the shortage of lightships, 32 lighted buoys have been installed. However, these buoys are easily damaged by collision with wood rafts and other ships, so it is difficult to be satisfactory, and there are not many suitable transport ships for the buoys. It is found that there were originally eight Yangtze River lighthouse transport ships with special structures. Now only three remain. The first ship is 20 years old, the second is 22 years old, and the third is 28 years old. After the victory, four more ships were added to undertake transportation and inspection tasks. Among them, two were warships formerly used by the U.S. Navy, and the other two were small steamers. The former are not suitable for practical use when the Yangtze River is shallow due to their excessive draft, and the latter are too small and only suitable for light tasks. In addition to the problems of incomplete equipment and insufficient funds, the most serious shortcoming is the lack of adequately trained personnel to engage in the management of river affairs and the planning of improvements. Before the war, the average number of specialists on shore and on ships was 15. They were able to effectively control this 1,500-mile-long waterway in terms of administrative supervision and technology. These 15 people were indeed overworked and understaffed. The reason why the navigation marks in the Yangtze River were able to be maintained was due to the fact that the experience level of each of these members was very high. There are currently 14 clerks, six of whom are drivers and are still in training.</p>
<h3>Nine Disturbance Injured Soldiers Scheduled for Trial Today</h3>

In addition to ordering the military discipline enforcement and picket teams to investigate and arrest them at any time, a notice was specially issued yesterday, stating that if citizens encounter such situations, they can immediately report to the public security military police authorities, or to the joint military police and gendarmerie investigation and handling office on Beijing East Road, and personnel will be dispatched to arrest them.</p>
<h3>Methods for Conscripting Laborers for Construction Projects, Participating Councilors Suggest Improvements</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Recently, the construction of city defense projects in the suburbs of this city has been frequent. The local garrison's method of conscripting civilian laborers by ordering district and village chiefs to do so is not good. The district and village chiefs of each district feel unable to cope. Zhang Xueqian, a city councilor from Longhua District, wrote to Mayor Wu, Commander Chen, and General Commander Tang of the Beijing-Shanghai District yesterday, suggesting improving the method of conscripting civilian laborers. He believes that civilian laborers should be given time to rest and eat, the work site should not be too far from their homes, all tools should be supplied by the competent authorities, and meal money should be appropriately subsidized to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Urges Reporting of Losses Incurred by Schools During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has instructed schools and social education institutions at all levels to quickly fill out and report the disaster loss situation form for consolidation and transfer.

<h3>CCP Radio Station Quotes Ding Ling's Old Manuscript to Vigorously Criticize Shanghai Comprador Culture</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] San Francisco, 110th Broadcast: The CCP radio station in northern Shaanxi today used the topic "Talking to Young Friends About Old Influences" and quoted the manuscript of the speech "Old Influences" by the famous CCP female writer Ding Ling in Harbin. It called on Chinese youth to deny the feudal culture of the modern era and oppose old concepts such as "loyalty to the emperor," "filial piety," and "chastity," believing that this kind of thinking is "most undesirable" and should be eradicated. It also said that the Chinese people today are facing a new era of people's liberation and should reject personal heroism. In addition, it also discussed the vacillation and duplicity of the petty bourgeoisie. The radio station also criticized Shanghai culture as "comprador culture" and called for a thorough purge of it. It also vigorously criticized the enjoyment of luxury American goods and nylon stockings. It also said that "American movies sound like having malaria," making it unbearable to listen to.</p>
<h3>An Anonymous Gentleman Generously Donates to Help the Poor and Needy, Generously Donates One Million Gold Yuan to Help Students, Calls on All Sectors to Follow Suit</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's "Reading and Helping Students Fund" for the spring of the 38th year has been fundraising for more than a month. The original goal of 500 dan of rice has not yet been half-raised. We are worried about many poor and needy students. We are preparing to issue application forms to various schools these days. According to the amount raised, only 150 college and high school students can be allocated, which is less than one-third of the original goal. In terms of the amount, it is the lowest record in the ten years that our newspaper has advocated helping students. Yesterday, our newspaper reporter happened to talk about this matter with an anonymous gentleman, and he generously agreed to donate one million gold yuan. Adding it to the donations from all parties in the past, it is enough to raise 250 dan of rice. He also wants to throw a brick to attract jade and call on all parties to donate another 250 dan to make it 500 dan and complete the planned goal for this year. This "anonymous" gentleman has been enthusiastic about helping students for ten years, and has donated countless amounts to the News and Ta Kung Pao student aid funds. More than a thousand poor and needy students have benefited. He has never revealed his real name or sought false fame. We respectfully call him the "Old Man Who Helps Students," which is truly a name that matches the reality and is by no means an exaggeration. The following is the old man's handwritten letter:</p>
<p>"To the editor, I have learned that your newspaper has held student aid funds for poor and needy students in the past, and each year it has been able to exceed the planned goal, which has benefited students greatly. Yesterday, Mr. Huang Jiping of the social service department of your newspaper came to my house and talked to me about the current situation of fundraising for this year's student aid fund. The original plan was 500 dan of rice, or 5 million gold yuan, and it was expected that 400-500 poor and needy college and high school students could be helped. Unexpectedly, as of today (February 19th), only 1.5 million gold yuan has been raised. It is intended to contact famous parties for fundraising in order to achieve the goal of reaching the planned goal, etc. I express my deep sympathy for poor and needy students. In this environment of limited ability, I barely managed to raise 1 million gold yuan. I know that it is a drop in the bucket and will not help much, but it is enough to make up half of the planned goal of your newspaper. Fortunately, your newspaper's performance is well-known. Continue to appeal to readers. There is no shortage of kind and sympathetic people in Shanghai who will reach out to help. Not to mention that it is still half of the original goal, it is not difficult to achieve, and it is possible to exceed the planned goal. The poor and needy students are fortunate, the society is fortunate. Anonymous respectfully, February 20th.</p>

<h3>Just Released from Prison, Steals Again, Pharmacy Employee Suspended from Duty, Steals After Failing to Borrow Money</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] At about 11:00 am on the 14th, Yuan Zhi, an employee of the Lida Pharmacy at No. 100 Qunnan Middle Road, reported to the Laoza Police Precinct that he discovered that his house had been pried open and entered at 5:00 am on the same day, and 619 bottles of various Western medicines were stolen, estimated to be worth 380,000 gold yuan, and requested an investigation. Section Chief Zhang Kuidong ordered officers Tang Zhiliang, Li Minsheng, Police Chief Liu Zongtong, Miao Dejin, and Xu Guizhu to go to investigate. It was then learned that a former employee, Huang Min, also known as Yaozhong, had been suspended from duty for misconduct. In December of last year, he had colluded with Zhao Guanfu to rob Western medicines in the Sato Hospital at No. 35 Guangyu Lane, Lintong Road. He was subsequently arrested and sentenced by the Yangshupu Precinct and had just been released recently. He had gone to the pharmacy to ask for a loan but failed. As a result of the investigation, Huang Min was suspected of being heavily involved. Therefore, at 3:00 pm, he was arrested. He initially tried to deny it, but after repeated and exhaustive questioning, Huang finally admitted to the theft. But he was unusually cunning, saying that the stolen goods had been handed over to Liu Dechang, who was gone without a trace, and often hid in the Ningxing or Far East Hotels. After being escorted to the above-mentioned two hotels for investigation, no one was found. All the information provided was fabricated. After speculation, it was decided that the major case was not committed by one person alone, and that his accomplice Zhao Guanfu had a criminal record in the past. It was certain that he had joined in the theft this time. It was also learned that Zhao lived in Chenjiaqiao No. 6, Pudong, and that Zhao had an older sister, Zhao Jinfeng, who lived at No. 10 Sanduo Lane, Jiaozhou Road. They went to the address and found part of the stolen goods. Zhao's second sister lived in the Shenxin No. 9 Factory workshop. The original handlers went to the Shenxin workshop again and found another part of the factory goods, and arrested the suspects who were harboring the stolen goods together to the bureau for strict questioning. Later, they confessed that Zhao Guanfu was acting at No. 6 Chenjiaqiao, Pudong. The Criminal Police Chief Liu Zongtong and Officer Xu Guizhu were sent to arrest the criminals and bring them to the bureau. They confessed that they had committed the theft together without denial.

<h3>Tenants of Donghua Building Appeal Against Eviction</h3>
<p>There are more than 40 households living in the Donghua Building (formerly known as Luo Chung Court) at No. 462 Zhejiang Middle Road in this city, from the second to the fifth floor. They have all been renting from Donghua Enterprise Company for many years (of which the five-story area was built by the tenants themselves, turning the platform into houses). Last year, Zhang Zhongquan of Junyi Company came forward, in the capacity of the main landlord, to file a lawsuit against Yonghua Company (the original tenant before Donghua Company) to recover the houses. Because Yonghua Company did not appear in court, Zhang Zhongquan won the lawsuit by default. Afterwards, he filed lawsuits against the tenants in batches, requesting a court order for eviction. The tenants were all defeated in succession, except for the three families of Lian Company on the third floor, who won the retrial in the High Court. Other floors are also in the process of filing appeals and are awaiting hearing. Recently, Zhang Zhongquan applied to the court for enforcement of the eviction in order to re-let them at a higher price. After the tenants requested to renew their leases, Zhang also proposed harsh conditions. The tenants, who are mostly proletarians, are inevitably overwhelmed. They are deeply worried that they will have no place to live in the future and are anxiously awaiting.

<h3>Deserters Knocked on the Door at Midnight; Volunteer Police Awakened in Surprise; Shot and Injured Two</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Lu Ronggen, a volunteer police officer living in a certain number in Aijia Alley in the jurisdiction of the Pudong Sisheng Police Sub-Bureau, is a farmer by profession. At about 2 a.m. yesterday morning, he suddenly heard someone knocking on the door in his sleep. The knocking persisted for a long time and was in a northern accent. Lu knew they were not good people, so he put on his clothes, got up, and held a service pistol. He sneaked out from the back door and saw three people knocking on the door, all in military uniforms and holding guns. Lu, in order to take the initiative, immediately drew his gun and fired several shots, hitting two of them, one wounded in the left arm and one wounded in the left leg. The remaining one, seeing his companions injured and falling to the ground, took the opportunity to escape and disappeared without a trace. After receiving the report, the Sisheng Police Sub-Bureau ordered a large number of police officers to come and search, but found nothing. They had no choice but to take the two wounded men to the sub-bureau for questioning. According to Xu Zhenlin, 41 years old, and Yu Baoqing, 40 years old, both from northern Zhejiang, they frankly admitted to being deserters, but categorically denied any attempt to rob. They also stated that the escaped companion was named Yang Hanqing, etc. The sub-bureau believed that the soldiers knocking on the door at midnight was a serious suspicion. At about 6 a.m., the two wounded soldiers were sent to the police hospital for treatment, and an investigation was underway.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Discusses Basic Education: Eliminating Illiteracy and Building a New Jiangsu; Making Full Efforts to Promote and Decides to Use Shanghai as a Demonstration County</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The Jiangsu Provincial Government is currently making full efforts to promote basic education and has decided to use Shanghai as a demonstration county. Regarding this issue, our Zhenjiang reporter made a special trip to the Provincial Office to interview Chairman Ding Zhipan, who spoke eloquently for more than an hour. He began by saying, "I am a soldier by profession. The chaos in China today is due to a lack of basic education. According to statistics from the highest education authorities, more than 80% of the Chinese people are still illiterate. They are all stuck in a semi-primitive state of ignorance. These many people, on the one hand, are prone to being taken advantage of due to 'ignorance', unknowingly creating all the contradictions in today's society. On the other hand, they are also 'unable' to cooperate with the government's construction responsibilities, thus prolonging the process of national construction. In my opinion, to build society and eliminate the source of chaos, it is necessary to start with the implementation of the minimum level of basic education in order to break through these barriers."</p>
<p>To Transform from the Root</p>
<p>Ding said that Jiangsu's education and culture have always been known for their development in the past, and all educational facilities often affect the education of the whole country. Now that the national crisis has not yet been resolved, after taking office, in order to realize the ideal of a new Jiangsu, we must transform it from the ground up, starting with the education of "people", which is a fundamental policy. At this point, Ding told a story to the reporter, saying: "Ding County in Hebei and Zouping in Shandong, because these two places have left indelible glorious deeds in the history of local autonomy. Ding County used the 'three methods' to test the 'four educations' and complete the 'six constructions'. Zouping used the educational activities of 'xiangxue' and 'cunxue' as the center of promoting rural construction. They all started with education and gradually cultivated the people's ability to 'manage, educate, raise, and defend', and later the results were very amazing."</p>
<p>Spirit and Practices</p>
<p>What are the spirit and practices of basic education? Ding told reporters in great detail: "First, it can improve the quality of the people and lay the foundation for national culture, because national culture is a measure of the strength of a country, especially in today's era of scientific development, the improvement of cultural level is an urgent task. In the basic education demonstration counties and demonstration areas, we have decided to step up the implementation of compulsory education and remedial education in order to eliminate illiteracy. Second, it can promote local autonomy and establish a national political foundation. Grassroots politics are extremely important. Only when the people are organized can they exert their strength. At the same time, the baojia chiefs are closest to the people, and whether they can faithfully implement government orders is truly related to the future of the country. In the basic education demonstration counties and districts, we must cultivate cadres, assist in organizing and training the people, and assist in the smooth promotion of the police district system. Third, vigorously promote production and construction to consolidate the national economic foundation. National wealth comes from the wealth of the people. This is an unbreakable principle. At present, the bankruptcy of rural areas and the decline of people's livelihoods in our country are all the result of backward production capacity. In the basic education demonstration counties and districts, we must cooperate with production plans and use the dissemination of scientific knowledge as a means to enable the people to engage in production increase by scientific methods, thereby improving the people's living skills."</p>
<p>Finally, Ding said in a very relaxed tone: "I hope that his basic education proposition can not only be implemented in every corner of Jiangsu Province, but also gradually become a national demonstration."</p>

<h3>Import and Export Management Committee Encourages Sales to Japan for Cash</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The Sino-Japanese trade, which was partially opened by the government last year, allows merchants to participate. However, before the peace treaty is signed, it is temporarily based on barter. Since July of last year, the results of barter have been considerable. Trade figures have been disclosed by the Import and Export Management Committee. The committee now believes that sales to Japan for cash can increase my country's foreign exchange income and should be encouraged. After repeated consultations with the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the method has been determined as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Any merchant who intends to sell goods to Japan for cash should first submit the sales contract to the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan for approval.</p>
<p>(2) When the merchant exports goods, he shall fill out an export settlement certificate, attach a letter of credit issued by the Japanese side, and sell foreign exchange to the designated bank in accordance with the regulations, and the designated bank shall certify it.</p>
<p>(3) When the merchant applies for export in Shanghai, he shall prepare a letter together with the export settlement certificate certified by the designated bank mentioned above and the sales contract approved by the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan, and submit it to the First Group of the Shanghai Office of the Import and Export Management Committee for verification and signature, and then take it to the customs for inspection and release. When applying for export at other ports, the above-mentioned certificates and contracts shall be submitted to the office of the association in the area where it is located.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding trade from Japan to China, before the new method of trade with Japan is approved and implemented by the government, except for those specially approved for barter, it is still temporarily prohibited.</p>
<h3>No Major Changes in Export Commodity Price Limits This Week</h3>
<p>[Reported by the Import and Export Management Committee] According to the Import and Export Management Committee, the price limits for export commodities this week (February 21 to 26) will not change, except for oilseed cakes, which will be slightly reduced. Also, starting this week, the item of hinoki cypress hats has been added to the list of price-limited commodities. The lowest export prices of the adjusted and added commodities are as follows:</p>
<p>Tea oil (in barrels) US$0.19 per pound</p>
<p>Cottonseed oil (bulk) US$380 per long ton</p>
<p>Cottonseed oil (in barrels) US$400 per long ton</p>
<p>Green oil (in barrels) £180 per long ton</p>
<p>Cottonseed cake US$45 per long ton</p>
<p>Soybean cake US$45 per long ton</p>
<p>Peanut cake US$50 per long ton</p>
<p>Sesame cake US$50 per long ton</p>
<p>Rapeseed cake US$35 per long ton</p>
<p>Hinoki cypress hats (super to second quality) US$4.25 per dozen</p>
<p>Hinoki cypress hats (first to third quality) US$3.50 per dozen</p>
<p>Hinoki cypress hats (second to fourth quality) US$2.75 per dozen</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Costs Increase</h3>
<p>Recently, woolen fabric manufacturers in Shanghai have been feeling depressed, mainly because raw materials are expensive and difficult to obtain. Electricity and coal prices are soaring, and the cost of living continues to rise, increasing costs day by day. The manufacturing process is prolonged. From the time the wool strips are put on the spinning wheel to the time the finished product is sorted, even a textile factory with complete equipment requires three to five months. Ordinary manufacturers who entrust others to spin and sort for them need to extend the time further, and funds are often slow to turn around. Borrowing high-interest loans to solve the problem is like drinking poison to quench thirst. In addition, due to environmental factors, sales continue to decline, and market prices are often lower than costs.</p>
<h3>Timber Costs Are Not Enough</h3>
<p>Although the timber market has been rising steadily since the lunar new year, market prices have not reached their peak in terms of cost. For example, the overseas price of foreign pine is 15.5 cents per foot, which requires 248 yuan based on an exchange rate of 1,600 yuan. Adding ad valorem customs duties and profits, the cost is at least 350 yuan or more. The current market price is 160 to 170 yuan at the highest, but those seeking cash are selling for 130 yuan, and the general price is 140 to 150 yuan. In addition, the price of fir wood at the place of origin is 35 yuan, plus 70 to 80 percent exchange losses and transportation and transfer fees, the cost is at least 60 yuan per foot. The market price is only 50 yuan, which is not enough to cover the costs. This is really due to the problem of actual sales.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Hainan Iron Mine</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liang Zhi</p>
<p>[Tai Newspaper, Hainan Island, 14th Dispatch] As the sole institution for developing mineral resources on Hainan Island, the Resource Commission's Hainan Island Iron Mine Bureau, a large-scale operation, is also located in Yulin Port. After more than two years of preparation following the victory, the bureau was officially established in May of last year. The organizational structure and various business operations of the bureau's Tiandu Iron Mine are as follows: (1) Organization: A total of 97 staff members (including 46 engineering personnel), and 1,421 workers (including 366 technicians). It has one mine director and one deputy mine director, under whom are six groups: engineering, mining, transportation, management, accounting, and materials, as well as one hospital. (2) Tiandu Mine: It has two ore bodies, east and west, with a total ore reserve of 4,800,000 tons, of which 2,600,000 tons have been extracted by the Japanese. Since its establishment, the bureau has mined approximately 25,000 tons, and the current remaining reserves are 1,950,000 tons. (3) Ore Quality: Primarily hematite, with minor limonite. The average composition is about 64%, and other harmful components such as sulfur and copper are minimal, making it the best in our country. (4) Mining Methods: (A) Churn drills: A hole is drilled every three meters, with depths ranging from nine to twenty meters. Each hole can blast approximately 3,000 metric tons of ore. (B) Room and pillar blasting. (C) Pneumatic drilling: Currently, there are B74 and B39 pneumatic drills. (5) Mining Records: According to past records using churn drills and room and pillar blasting methods, each worker could extract 20-60,000 tons, with a consumption of 0-18 of explosives per ton. If pneumatic drills are used, each worker can only extract 5 tons, with an explosives consumption of 0-35 pounds. (6) Ore Processing Procedures: On each level of the mine, ore is manually loaded onto cars and transported to the vertical shaft openings on each level, then sent to the underground main transportation tunnel, using a 10,000-ton belt conveyor to load the ore cars (each loading 15 cars takes 20 minutes). The ore cars are then transported along an 11.8-kilometer railway to the Anyou ore storage belt conveyor for loading onto ships (capable of loading 400 to 700 tons of ore per hour). The Hainan Iron Mine Bureau previously had an annual contract with a British trading company, selling the ore at a price of seven US dollars per ton. Since February of last year, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been responsible for transporting the ore until the end of the year, with a total of 293,083.35 tons transported. The first batch of the contract, 250,000 tons, was completed in mid-January of the 37th year [of the Republic]. The contract was continuously renewed, and as of the time of this writing, 46,601.8 metric tons have been transported. Currently, the staff of the Iron Mine Bureau here are very diligent, maintaining a lifeline for the industrial and mining enterprises of South China. At a time when the industrial and mining enterprises of the Northeast are almost at a standstill, the position of the Hainan Iron Mine Bureau is even more significant. The Iron Mine is emphasizing the "new steel capital of Qiong Island." We hope that the Hainan Iron Mine Bureau will actively develop and achieve the goals of developing resources and building Qiongya [Hainan].</p>
<p>In addition, the Shilu Iron Mine in western Hainan is also managed by the Hainan Iron Mine Bureau. However, it is said that the mineral deposits here are even richer than those of Tiandu, but due to security concerns, resumption of work and mining have not yet been possible. Furthermore, the Dongfang Hydroelectric Project in Changjiang is also very grand and is the only treasure on Qiong Island, previously managed by the Hainan Power Plant. In August of last year, due to financial difficulties at the power plant, it was ordered to close and was handed over to the Iron Mine Bureau for safekeeping. If security cannot be improved and the Shilu Iron Mine cannot be mined, then the Dongfang Hydroelectric Plant is merely fulfilling its nominal role of safekeeping, and the electrification of the entire Qiong Island is still a long way off.</p>

<h3>Qunli Displays Power: Defeats Zhenru Ten to One</h3>
<p>In the first week of the Mayor's Cup football tournament, Qunli vs. Zhenru took place at 10:00 AM yesterday at Yi Park, with only a few spectators. Qunli displayed its power, winning decisively by a score of ten to one. The first half ended with a score of two to zero, and Zhenru completely collapsed in the second half.</p>
<p>Zhenru took the offensive first, and the two sides were deadlocked. In the thirty-eighth minute, Wang Lianhai fouled in the penalty area, and Chen Longquan scored the penalty kick.

<h3>Basketball League: Internal Strife, Two Fast Teams Clash, Renyu Fights Hard to Overcome Hujing</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The fourth Basketball League has entered a tense stage. Last night's Group A match between Hujing (formerly Chenyou) and Renyu was nothing short of internal strife. Both sides possessed good players and played at a fast pace. After forty minutes of intense competition, Renyu surprisingly overwhelmed Hujing by a score of 43 to 36. The first half ended with a score of 20 to 14. Renyu's players were adept at both offense and defense, with balanced development. Xu Zhongyi was particularly lively. If merits were to be rewarded, he would always be in first place. Hujing appeared flustered, but Renyu missed many opportunities with free throws. In another match, the women's team Li defeated Xinghua, 40 to 37. In a friendly match for men, Donghua defeated Hongqi, 47 to 39. The battle situations in each match are as follows:</p>
<p>Li Team Defeats Xinghua, Wang Shan Supports the Remnants</p>
<p>In the women's match between the Li team and Xinghua, the Li team's forwards were unstoppable in the first quarter. Qian Youping's back was imprinted with the Xinghua defenders' plasters, two patches of blood red, which were even more vivid and eye-catching on the light yellow jersey. In this quarter, the Li team's young players gained an advantage with a score of 18 to 13. In the second quarter, Xinghua tried to catch up and surpass, but soon the Li team recovered and eventually won by half a point with a score of 24 to 23.</p>
<p>Xinghua is the embodiment of whiteness, and was indeed a very good team in the past, always posing a threat to the Green team, the leader of the Shanghai women's basketball league. Unfortunately, they have had little collective practice recently and have lost their touch. In the third quarter, the score was 34 to 27, still in their disadvantage. In the last quarter, Xinghua's Wang Shan struggled to support the remnants, with stable shooting. With forty to thirty-five, there was still one and a half minutes left. The Li team saw that the situation was not good and used a slow, attrition-based strategy. As a result, the score was forty to thirty-seven. Xinghua was upset, and the Li team cheered.</p>
<p>Friendly Match, Donghua Defeats Hongqi</p>
<p>In the friendly match between Donghua and Hongqi, both sides moved very quickly. In the first half, Hongqi had 23 points, and Donghua had 18. The battle situation in the first half was turbulent, with scores fluctuating. Donghua's shooting was even more comprehensive. Hongqi was brave but had too many loopholes. In the last minute, Han Longhai committed his fifth foul and had only four players left. The final score was 47 to 39, and Hongqi was defeated.</p>
<p>Originally from the Same Root: Renyu Breaks Hujing</p>
<p>Hujing (Chenyou)'s players are: Wang Rongsheng, Chuan Qixia, Shi Jiuquan, He Zeng, Wang Bowen. Renyu's players are: Cai Jindian, Li He, Xu Zhongyi, Shen Pengju, Wang Huaiting. They are brothers fighting each other. In the first four minutes, both sides scored two points each. From then on, Renyu's He and Jindian scored one after another. At ten minutes, they maintained a one-sided situation of seven to two. Cai Fuzeng scored a goal, which was extremely strange. Rongsheng and Xiong Biao painted a picture of peace, but the former wasted all four free throws. Commendable, but Renyu's A Cai and Zhongyi scored consecutive baskets, 18 to 8. Hujing only relied on free throws to score. Since He Jingui and Xiong Biao replaced Jindian and Bowen, there was no improvement. The first half ended with Renyu leading by six points, 20 to 14.</p>
<p>In the second half, the main players of both teams, Bowen and Zhongyi, each scored two goals at the beginning. Bowen made a free throw, and A Liang followed up, making it 24 to 21, gradually getting closer. Jindian was replaced by Huaiting, and Wenyi replaced Pengju. Hujing's Jingui scored a basket, and Rongsheng also scored from the periphery, taking the lead 25 to 24. Guo Zheng, Bowen, and Xin Yun each displayed their special skills, and the score was tied twice at 26 and 28. He Zeng replaced Qixia, Pengju replaced Wenyi, Xin Yun scored two free throws, leading by two points again. Zhongyi adjusted Guo Zheng, and Huaiting replaced Jindian. The other side, Jingui, also scored two free throws, not allowing the score to remain tied at 30. Huaiting missed a free throw, which the audience regretted. Fortunately, Xu Zhongyi made up for it with a goal, Xin Yun made it 34 to 30. The actions of both sides became increasingly heated, and the formations were frequently changed. Renyu had many free throws that they didn't take advantage of. Xin Yun's sprint, with throws and fouls, made it 37 to 31. There were still four minutes left, Jingui scored. Rongsheng stole, still two points behind. Zhaohe retaliated with a goal, four points ahead. In the last two minutes, Jindian replaced Zhaohe, Jingui added a point for Hujing, Renyu's Zhongyi broke through again, and Pengju's last contribution ended the game, 43 to 36. Hujing (Chenyou) lost for the first time.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Brew a National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>Reporter of This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Hague, 12th Dispatch] Recently, patriotic overseas Chinese residing in Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas, lamenting that China's international status as one of the five major powers has greatly diminished due to internal strife after the victory against Japan, even to the point of being ridiculed by countries such as the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, attribute the cause to the incessant civil wars in our country, which have led to a decline in population and national strength. Ultimately, they trace the root cause to falling into the "using Chinese to control Chinese" deceit and conspiracy of other countries to weaken China; therefore, they believe that it is urgently necessary to seek transcendence and extricate ourselves, lest we continue to be fooled by others until the country is destroyed and the race is extinct without even realizing it. In order to save China from danger and destruction, relieve the suffering of compatriots, and safeguard the acquired international status as one of the five major powers, they are now brewing the organization of a "Global Patriotic Overseas Chinese National Salvation Grand Alliance" to awaken all overseas Chinese around the world, to unite and rise up together, to call for peace, and to jointly save the motherland.</p>
<p>The declaration of the "Global Patriotic Overseas Chinese National Salvation Grand Alliance" (entitled "Overseas Chinese and the Motherland") and its organizational measures, which are currently being brewed, are as follows:</p>
<p>The Republic of China</p>
<p>Is the motherland of us all, therefore all citizens of the Republic of China residing abroad are simply referred to as "overseas Chinese."</p>
<p>The Republic of China was created by the National Revolution, and the National Revolution was initiated, supported, and assisted by the overseas Chinese led by the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen; therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen is the Father of China, and the overseas Chinese are the Mother of the Revolution.</p>
<p>We can say that without the National Revolution, we could not have overthrown the rule of the Manchu Qing, a foreign race from the north at that time, nor could we have established the Republic of China that we all share now.</p>
<p>At the same time, if it were not for the National Revolution, we would not have been able to defeat imperialism, eliminate warlords, recover concessions, resist Japan, abolish unequal treaties, and make China one of the five major powers.</p>
<p>In the past forty years, every time the National Revolution progressed a step, our country's status rose a level, our compatriots at home and abroad looked better, and everyone's mood was more pleasant.</p>
<p>We should ask: Why does the National Revolution have such great power and achieve such great results?</p>
<p>This is because the Father of the Nation said: "The purpose of the National Revolution is to seek the welfare of the citizens of the Republic of China," to seek freedom and equality for China, and to realize the ideal of world harmony.</p>
<p>The spirit of the National Revolution is entrusted to the Three Principles of the People created by the Father of the Nation:</p>
<p>(1) Using nationalism to "expel the Tartars and restore China," overthrowing the rule of foreign races that conquered China, returning China's sovereignty to the hands of the Chinese people, and the territory of China should be wholly owned by the Chinese people. At the same time, it advocates that all ethnic groups in the country should be equal in status, and sympathizes with any weak and oppressed ethnic countries and helps them liberate and revive.</p>
<p>(2) Using the principle of democracy to teach the Chinese people how to assemble, how to elect, how to impeach, how to initiate, and how to hold referendums, and then formulate a constitution so that all citizens of the country are equal to each other, have freedom, and can participate in politics.</p>
<p>(3) Using the principle of people's livelihood to equalize land ownership, regulate capital, increase food and clothing production, and build houses and transportation to make China rich, strong, prosperous, and happy.</p>
<p>Because the Three Principles of the People were created by the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, they are most suitable for China and are most welcomed by the Chinese people. Not only do the overseas Chinese support them, but also many compatriots in the country support them. Therefore, the movement of the National Revolution can develop very quickly and achieve great success.</p>
<p>After China defeated Japan, it became one of the five major powers in the world. Recalling the time of victory, how excited and happy were the compatriots at home and the overseas Chinese, and all harbored infinite hope for the future of the motherland.</p>
<p>But three years later, China's international status as one of the five major powers is only in name. Not only has the Soviet Union already looked down on us, but other countries now do not treat us as a major power. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Some people say that this is due to the rebellion of the Chinese Communist Party, while others say that this is due to the incompetence of the government.</p>
<p>But from the perspective of us overseas Chinese, everything is still because both sides fell for the "using Chinese to control Chinese" strategy of other countries after the war, weakening China without a fight, causing us to kill each other, while they reaped the benefits.</p>
<p>Chinese compatriots are killing each other, reducing the population and weakening national strength, of course losing the good reputation they had at the end of the war.</p>
<p>After the war, other countries buried themselves in construction and tried to revive, but our China, which had already been more arduous than any other country in the eight years of resisting Japan, still had to continue with wars. Isn't this too incomprehensible?</p>
<p>If there had been no wars in the country in the past three years, and all parties could have unanimously formed armies composed of all the strong compatriots, and sent them to the east, south, west, and north to strengthen border defenses, and at the same time used the remaining resources after the war to build and prepare to recover the newly struggled for and should have been recovered Chinese territories, China could have become a truly worthy one of the five major powers, and the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States would not have ridiculed China as they do today.</p>
<p>What is past cannot be remedied, but what is to come can still be pursued. In order to save the motherland from danger, to relieve the suffering of compatriots, and to safeguard the acquired international status as one of the five major powers, we overseas Chinese should urgently and loudly call for:</p>
<p>(1) Immediately and promptly stop the civil war of Chinese compatriots killing each other, and extricate ourselves as soon as possible and strive to avoid any conspiracy or trap of other countries to "use Chinese to control Chinese" and weaken our China.</p>
<p>(2) Continue the Father of the Nation's legacy of saving the country, implement the Three Principles of the People, complete the National Revolution, and realize the ideal of governing China with the principles of the Chinese people, without being directly or indirectly controlled by any foreign race.</p>
<p>(3) Since the purpose of the National Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for the motherland and seek the welfare of all compatriots, and the National Revolution has created the Republic of China, making China one of the five major powers, therefore, any government that directly relies on the strength of other countries to grow or is indirectly controlled by other countries is a government that opposes the National Revolution. We believe that compatriots at home and abroad will resolutely oppose it to the death.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese are the mother of the National Revolution. Everyone has a personal stake in the rise and fall, strength and weakness of the Republic of China and must not ignore it. We believe that the true prerequisite for the Republic of China to be strong and prosperous is that the above three points must be achieved; otherwise, it is heading for decline and destruction, or willingly becoming another person's vassal state. This is the fatal heartache and unparalleled humiliation of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Patriotic overseas Chinese, let us all unite and form a Global Patriotic Overseas Chinese National Salvation Grand Alliance to save the endangered motherland and our compatriots, following in the footsteps of the Father of the Nation. The organizational measures (draft) of the Grand Alliance are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>National Salvation Guidelines</p>
<p>(1) Call on both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to immediately stop the wars of Chinese compatriots killing each other, and extricate ourselves as soon as possible and strive to avoid any conspiracy or trap of any country to "use Chinese to control Chinese" and weaken our China. (2) Continue the Father of the Nation's legacy of saving the country, implement the Three Principles of the People, complete the National Revolution, and realize the principle of governing China with the principles of the Chinese people, without being controlled by any foreign race. (3) Since the purpose of the National Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China and seek the welfare of all compatriots, and the achievements of the National Revolution have overthrown the Manchu Qing, established the Republic, eliminated warlords, defeated imperialism, recovered concessions, resisted Japan, abolished unequal treaties in the past, and made China one of the five major powers, therefore, any government that directly relies on the strength of other countries to grow or is indirectly controlled by other countries is a government that opposes the National Revolution and is opposed to the death by our compatriots at home and abroad.</p>

<h3>The Yangtze's Projecting Tongue - Chongming</h3>
<p>— Qiuyang</p>
<p>[Chongming, 10th Day of Autumn Sun] If the Yangtze River can be said to be China's treasury, then Chongming is its projecting tongue. Though this island's history is not long, its geographical position is quite important. It can be said to be China's front door. Unfortunately, it has no natural defenses, being an alluvial plain. But if China had a large navy, this could still be a good harbor.</p>
<p>Without Chong, No Stage</p>
<p>The entire population of Chongming County, according to official statistics, is approximately 460,000. The main products are rice, beans, and cotton, but the food supply is not sufficient for even two or three months. The exact figures are unknown due to lack of accurate statistics, so it is impossible to deduce the true situation. Due to the food shortage, most of the residents here seek opportunities elsewhere. Perhaps due to its geographical proximity to Shanghai, their occupations are mostly concentrated in navigation, telecommunications, and textiles. Every China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship has Chongming sailors; "Without Chong, No Stage," which shows the development of Chongming people in this area.</p>
<p>The Fort Towns Are the Most Prosperous</p>
<p>Chongming Island is about 180 *li* (approximately 60 miles) long from east to west, and the widest part from north to south is about 30 *li* (approximately 10 miles). There are no mountains on the island, but there is a small river every three *li* (approximately 1 mile). The most prosperous commerce is in the fort towns, followed by the bridge towns. The commerce in Chongming city is very desolate and bleak. Besides a few rice shops and hot water vendors, there are almost no decent stores to be seen. Because of the climate, the residences and shops here are mostly single-story buildings, with the highest being no more than four stories.</p>
<p>Low Cultural Level</p>
<p>What is questionable is that while transportation here is very convenient, cultural undertakings are quite backward. There are three newspapers, all small-sized octavo news sheets. The editing and printing all seem to fall short of standards. The books in the library are mostly outdated and propaganda from the Executive Yuan Information Bureau. There are no bookstores or newspaper distribution agencies. It is very difficult to read a newspaper or magazine you want to read here. A Shanghai newspaper costs an exorbitant price from vendors, even more than double the Shanghai price.</p>
<p>"Small Country with Few People"</p>
<p>However, the cultural level here does not seem to be inferior to that of the mainland. There are more than a dozen middle schools here. Generally speaking, the level of knowledge of the people is not considered low. The people here mostly have a custom of collecting books. The folk customs are simple and honest. When you come into contact with them, there is only sincerity, without any pretense. Living here is like returning to a "small country with few people" society. You really don't know what era it is, with a strong flavor of Shangri-La, even though this is the cutting edge of the struggle between two forces.</p>
<p>Ancient Sages in Their Seventies</p>
<p>Most people who have been to Chongming know that there are two "sages" here. Out of curiosity, I once visited the home of the sages. Their home is near the west of the city. Deep in the bamboo fence, several tile-roofed houses are faintly visible. "Although there is a door, it is always closed." The two old gentlemen are both over seventy years old. They are often away from home. Although their past actions were different, now they both "have a *pu tuan* cushion and a lamp," to nurture their remaining years. One lives in the Suzhou Release Pond, and the other lives in the Chongming countryside. Mr. Li Jue Wu was formerly a soldier who served as a battalion commander during the era of the Northern Warlords. He made outstanding contributions in the Qi-Lu War, but precisely because of this, he seemed to have a Huangliang dream (a dream of empty glory). He watched many of his beloved brothers disappear in the fierce fighting, and other people's brothers fell one by one. At this time, he realized why his compatriots were killing each other like this. From this time on, he left the army, re-verified good results, changed his name to "Yi Jue" (One Awakening), and styled himself "Jue Wu" (Awakening Myself). From his name, it is not difficult for us to see the transformation of Mr. Li's thinking. This transformation is the watershed of Mr. Li's personality and morality, and also a major reason why Mr. Li is hailed as one of the sages.</p>
<p>Advanced Revolutionary</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Shen Fu is an advanced revolutionary. In his early years, he studied in Japan, followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and engaged in secret activities. Under the corrupt and incompetent Qing court's autocratic power, he often held secret meetings, trained party members, and made great contributions to the revolution. He was upright and had the spirit of an ancient chivalrous hero. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the Japanese occupied Chongming County, Mr. Cai lived in a rural villa. He did not enter the city until the Japanese army left Chongming, showing his patriotism. The gentleman was unrestrained and did not engage in family production. One year, he bought lottery tickets and won a huge sum of money, but he soon scattered it all. It is said that his wife only received eight yuan. His public-mindedness and selflessness can be seen from this. Although the gentleman is over seventy years old, his spirit is still vigorous, and he often walks dozens of *li* without fatigue. The two gentlemen now both eat vegetarian food and chant Buddhist scriptures. They both seem to have seen through life, but it is also because they have not found true answers to life's questions.</p>
<p>Blowing the Charge Horn Himself</p>
<p>Mr. Li's second son was killed in action in Guide during the Anti-Japanese War. It is said that Mr. Li's son was a battalion commander at this time. When the battalion bugler was killed in action, Mr. Li blew the charge horn himself and died for his country. His heroic spirit is also very admirable!</p>
<p>The Yangtze River flows turbulently to the boundless coast, and the simple and honest people of Chongming also stand quietly in the endless flow of time. May Chongming Island be blessed to live such a peaceful and harmonious life forever.</p>
<h3>President Chiang Watches Peking Opera Performance in Fenghua</h3>
<p>Entire Audience Stands to Pay Respects</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Fenghua, this newspaper, 18th] On the evening of the 17th of this month, Peking opera was performed at the auditorium of Wuling School in Xikou. The program included "Beating the City God," "Chun Xiang Making a Scene in School," "Spring and Autumn Match," and "Mount Dingjun." At exactly 8:00 PM, President Chiang arrived by car. When he entered the venue, more than a thousand audience members stood up to pay their respects. President Chiang, in a cheerful spirit, took off his hat and nodded frequently, and said quickly, "Good..." When the performance ended, the audience still rose and stood in silence as before, and only dispersed in an orderly manner after President Chiang walked out of the venue.</p>
<h3>Massacre of Tian Hezhong, Speaker of the Longshan County Council, Injustice Cleared, Weak Women Avenge, Hundreds of People and Guns Engage in Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Changsha, this newspaper, 20th] Tian Hezhong, Speaker of the Longshan County Council and Chief Secretary of the County Party Department, was brutally murdered last year by Xiang Tianshou, Captain of the Self-Defense Detachment. More than half a year has passed, and although the murderer has been detained, he has not been punished. Tian had a daughter named Guangmei, who was studying at Hunan University in Changsha. Grieved by her father's tragic death and unavenged injustice, she returned to her hometown during the winter vacation and gathered hundreds of Tian clan members with guns to avenge her father. According to people from Longshan, the armed struggle has been going on for half a month and is still in full swing.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Zhakou Pumping Station, Mechanical Irrigation, Benefiting Farmland Area Up to 100,000 *Mu*</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, 19th] The Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Management Office of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, in cooperation with the Hunan and Jiangxi provincial governments, conducted mechanical drainage projects in Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake last November, benefiting a total area of 260,000 *mu*. Now, in order to make full use of the existing pumps, the office signed a contract with the Zhejiang provincial government again in January this year to conduct the Hangzhou Zhakou Pumping Station mechanical irrigation project. According to the plan, the pumping station was originally located on the north bank of the Qiantang River outside Datong Bridge in Zhakou, Hangzhou, divided into the first and second stations. Both stations draw fresh water from the Qiantang River at low tide, and then pass it through the Central River of Hangzhou (11.5 kilometers long), and then inject it into the Shangtang River (46.7 kilometers long) and the Jianqiao River (14.7 kilometers long), to irrigate more than 100,000 *mu* of farmland along the rivers in Hangzhou, Hang County, and Haining and other cities and counties. During the Anti-Japanese War, both pumping stations were destroyed, resulting in the disruption of the water sources of the Shangtang and Jianqiao rivers. Even a slight drought would put the farmers along the rivers at risk of water shortage. In the autumn of 1934 and 1947, Zhejiang Province reported droughts, and the farmland in this area was the most severely affected. In order to reduce the drought disaster, the above-mentioned pumping stations should be restored as soon as possible to facilitate irrigation. The mechanical irrigation project of the pumping station now under consideration will change the two stations into one, in line with the principle of economy. The project plan is divided into two parts: (1) Mechanical part - the Agricultural Reclamation Office will provide nine sets of 11-inch screw-type pumps (including Chrysler 60-horsepower diesel engines and necessary accessories). When fully operational, it is expected to pump 45,000 gallons of water per minute. (2) Civil engineering part - it is planned to build a house with an area of 1,680 square feet near the original site of the first pumping station, with a reinforced concrete reservoir underneath, connected to the water diversion ditch outside the dike. Above the reservoir, ten 20x20-foot reinforced concrete large well holes will be built, with cover plates on the top, and nine pumps will be installed. The remaining one well will be used for workers to go up and down for inspection, with ladders and gates inside. A small ditch will be dug between the pumping station and the inner river to connect them. The total cost of the above-mentioned projects is estimated to be US$46,000, equivalent to 18,400 *shi* (a unit of dry measure) of rice. Among them, the mechanical equipment requires 10,760 *shi* of rice, the water discharge equipment requires 4,400 *shi* of rice, the factory building requires 1,640 *shi* of rice, and the reserve fund requires 1,600 *shi* of rice. This fund will be borne by the Shangtang River Water Conservancy Council, which is established by the relevant cities and counties along the river, and will collect engineering benefit fees from the benefited farmland, to be repaid in eight years. The pumps and engines will be transferred to the benefiting farmers' organizations one year after the irrigation project is completed, so that they can continue to use them. The irrigation project is scheduled to be completed before the end of March this year, so as not to delay the agricultural season. After completion, it will be handed over to the Shangtang River Water Conservancy Council for acceptance, responsible for management, use, and maintenance. It is estimated that the water pumped by the pumping station can meet the irrigation needs of 100,000 *mu* of farmland on both sides of the Shangtang River and the Jianqiao River. From then on, there will be no drought disasters, and rice production will be stable. Moreover, with timely irrigation, there will be increased production. It is calculated that the average annual increase in production is 5 *shi* per *mu*, and the annual increase in production is 50,000 *shi*, which is about three times the total project cost. In peacetime, the power equipment of the station can also be used for agricultural product processing. In addition, the problem of discharging sewage from the Hangzhou city river can also be solved in conjunction, which will be of great benefit to urban sanitation.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Talks About the Southwest</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xueduan, reporter for this newspaper</p>
<p>[Airmail from Chengdu, this newspaper, 17th] Continuous spring rain, sometimes warm and sometimes cold. On the evening of the 14th, the Phoenix Mountain Airport in the suburbs of Chengdu was temporarily crowded with officials to welcome the newly appointed Director of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, Zhang Qun. The first feeling of this central figure in the Southwest situation after getting off the plane was facing so many eager and expectant faces. Indeed, the overall situation is changing, and the Southwest has become the center of national stability. Zhang's return to power in the border administration this time means that the task is more difficult, and his hometown's expectations for him are increasing. In order to repay the local hospitality, he exceptionally made his first speech on the Southwest issue after taking office at two public gatherings.</p>
<p>Sincere Unity, Prepare for Contingencies</p>
<p>Zhang believes that the current situation in the Southwest is "fundamentally not normal but requires contingency plans. The primary way to deal with contingencies is sincere unity among the five provinces and cities in the Southwest. Only with unity can there be strength, and only then will we be able to protect ourselves." He elaborated that since the end of the tutelage period, he has visited the Southwest and North China as a private citizen, and went to Japan for a trip, trying to devote himself to the organization of the Asia Economic Group. However, "the situation is changing, and the national affairs are difficult and dangerous. The central government has given me the mission of pacifying the Southwest. Although I am worried about the difficulty of the task, I cannot but accept the order resolutely and return to Sichuan to overcome hardships and seek self-help and national salvation with the local people, in the spirit of respecting and serving my hometown," and cited Ouyang Xiu as an example of a Jiangxi person who was not buried in his hometown to avoid criticism. "Today, the Southwest is the last bastion of the country. Only with unity and cooperation can we talk about nation-building and revitalization. As for the major plans for peace and war, of course, they are decided by the central government. The local government must not have other plans. There is no reason for 'autonomy,' only 'self-reliance' and 'self-sufficiency' are the only good policies to stabilize the Southwest and revitalize the country."</p>
<p>Frankly Admit Mistakes, Thoroughly Reform</p>
<p>Zhang believes that the current national situation is seriously difficult and dangerous. The reasons for the crisis are that "we cannot simply talk about military failures and ignore the political and economic reasons. For example, the achievements of the Communist Party are not due to the soundness of communism itself or the special ability of the Communist Party, but because Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, especially the Principle of People's Livelihood, have not yet been implemented today." "If we had implemented the equalization of land ownership and the regulation of capital of the Principle of People's Livelihood long ago, how could the situation have come to this!" To save the country, he believes that "we should frankly admit our mistakes, thoroughly eliminate the old and bring forth the new, and make a comprehensive and thorough renovation." In the past, when he was in charge of Sichuan, he put forward the slogans of "seeking stability in construction and seeking progress in stability." "Today is an extraordinary period. We must not seek temporary stability, so as to accommodate facts, connect emotions, and perfunctorily deal with personnel. This kind of 'flat' policy is no longer feasible. The only need at present is 'thoroughness,' thorough change, thorough awakening, thorough introspection, and thorough reform!"</p>
<p>Self-Liquidation, Develop People's Power</p>
<p>As for how to innovate? Zhang put forward an alarming slogan: "We must liquidate ourselves, not wait for others to liquidate us, and liquidation is not only about wealth, we must liquidate our thoughts, strength, and all living habits." Zhang believes that the way to reform comprehensively is that "the way to reform is complicated, and the central force to promote it is to unite the people. We must make the people of the Southwest provinces and cities cooperate closely with the government, and the government formulates policies based on the will of the people, expresses the will of the people, and uses the power of the people." In terms of politics, economy, and military affairs, he believes that "local finances depend on the central government and cannot be independent. Taking the Southwest as an example, if Sichuan recovers what the central government recovers, it can still balance financial revenues and expenditures, but Kang, Dian, Qian, and Yu cannot do it. Therefore, economic reforms should consider the environment, study plans, and make comprehensive plans. Politics and military affairs are closely related. The way to reform should be to develop the people's power, increase production, clarify officialdom, and organize local forces."</p>
<p>In summary, Zhang Xueli stayed in Chengdu for three days and made two public speeches. From his speech, we can see his firm belief in stabilizing the Southwest, which is also the current urgent hope of the people of the Southwest.</p>

<h3>Huang Xuchu Returns from Afar, Talks About the Situation</h3>
<p>[Airmail from Guilin, this newspaper, 14th] Just when the atmosphere of peace was rising and there were many rumors in Guangxi, Provincial Chairman Huang Xuchu quietly flew to Wuhan, went to the capital Beijing and then to Guangzhou, making a journey around the southern half of the country. The task of this trip was, of course, extraordinary.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, Huang left Guilin at the invitation of General Bai, Commander-in-Chief of Central China, and returned to the provincial capital on the 12th. He traveled all the way. After getting off the plane, he drove back to the provincial government to preside over the provincial affairs meeting. Not long after the meeting, the Commander-in-Chief telephoned to inquire about the results of the trip to Guangzhou. It was not until the evening that he could meet with reporters. This was the busiest time for him in recent years. He was very happy with what he saw and heard on this trip. He said: The people's hearts in the capital are stable, and there is no more chaos than in the past. Acting President Li is working hard for peace, following the declaration of President Chiang. The people need peace, the government needs peace, and the Communist Party also needs peace. Everyone is seeking peace, and the prospects for peace are very optimistic. But peace is not empty talk, nor does it need local peace. Speaking of this, he cited Beijing as an example. The daughter of a certain professor at a certain university in the city was studying at a certain university in Beijing. When the Communist army was about to enter Beijing, she wrote a letter saying: "Our bright and free days are coming soon." After the Communist army entered the city, she wrote a letter saying: When writing to her, political issues should not be mentioned. It can be seen that local peace is not true peace.</p>
<p>He also said: The situation is serious, and everyone must unite and persevere in order to make peace. In the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign, the Communist army suffered heavy casualties, and then retreated north in order to reorganize and replenish. The focus of this province's work this year is no different from last year, "strengthening organization and training, and ensuring public security" is still the first task. Therefore, he announced that although martial law has been lifted, actions that hinder security are still prohibited.</p>
<p>Finally, he dispelled the rumors, saying: "There are many rumors outside that Guangxi is independent, and Guangdong is going to fight Guangxi. I (referring to Huang) met with Chairman Xue of Guangdong Province in Guangzhou this time. The host and guests were happy, and there were no different words. All measures in this province are completely under the command of the central government." He refuted the rumors as purely unfounded.
