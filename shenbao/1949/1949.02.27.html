<p>〔合衆社南京廿六日電〕李代總統廿六日開始謀取政府的再團結及對共和平的努力。由於北平方面傳來的「鼓勵性」的消息，李代總統廿六日晨在其官邸召集高級政府官員，對政府在和平會議中應採的態度與提出的要求，初步交換意見。某官方人士稱：和平會議的開始，已在不遠，政府高級官員間的討論，當然必須集中在政府應採之態度及應提出之要求上。據悉：政府官員間首待協議者，將爲軍隊整編問題，俾向共方提出爲商談的基礎，國防部官員草擬之具體計劃，則係大致根據馬歇爾調解時之舊協定者。</p>

<p>〔聯合社南京廿六日電〕據官方宣布：立法院定廿八日在京開會。在京立委曾舉行非正式會議，表示不願與堅持在穗開會之立委公開破裂。一部分立委稱：立法院雖在南京開會，若形勢變化，不能繼續安全舉行時，則可移往他處。</p>

<p>湯恩伯對外記者談話</p>

<h3>平漢路隧道橋樑　國軍無破壞之意</h3>
<p>中共廣播所指係誤傳</p>
<p>〔本報信腸廿六日電〕曾經中共三次廣播之「國軍將破壞平漢路武勝關隧道（信陽以南距漢口一七三公里）及長台關淮河大橋（信陽以北距漢口三二九公里）」一說，茲據路方報吿，顯屬誤傳，事　週前會有國軍工兵一小隊，活動於淮河大橋試採防禦性措施，以備萬一，但旋卽離去。至武勝關隱則從未埋置炸藥，因目前無此必要，將來亦不致如此做也。</p>
<h3>孫院長主繼續裁軍　穩定物價關鍵在能否和平　中央地方均權必促其實現</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿六日電〕行政院長孫科，廿六日午十一時在中外記者招待會席上稱，財經改革新方案業經公布，惟有若干有關財政改善之重要問題，現尙在積極商討中。如：（一）軍事上之改革問題，原有國軍六三〇萬人，後减爲五〇〇萬人，最後又決定减至四二〇萬人，惟此數目照目前財政情形仍感不易負担，故裁減軍隊，節省軍費，爲當前急不容緩之事。現正在商討者，爲兵役改革問題，有人主張撤銷征兵制，改爲募兵制，但需詳細硏究，始能決定。（二）財經新方案僅爲治標方法，使物價能暫時穩定，但要治本，仍有許多問題，現正積極硏討，逐步實施改革。目前物價波動，通貨膨脹等能否遏止，則以能否和平爲關鍵，萬一和平絕望，則當然有更大之困難，惟目前雙方已表示有意談和。現邵力子等進行情形雖尙未接獲報吿，但以渠觀察，和平前途必甚樂觀。此次李總統南來，對上述各項重要問題，尤其進行和談方面，已有初步決定，孫氏並卽席表示，渠一二日內卽赴京，再度與各方詳細商討。</p>
<h3>立院如在京復會孫氏當出席報告</h3>
<p>至政院遷回南京問題，現尙未作決定，因和平尙未到相當時機也。氏最後對記者詢問答稱：（一）劉部長維熾被控貪汚事想係謠言，現在調查中。（二）劉不同請渠辭職之函，渠尙未見到，無從答覆。（三）立法院如確定在京復會，渠當出席報吿。（四）政院遷穗，係得李代總統同意，並非擅行。（五）吳裕後等赴平，純係出於彼等自動，政院確曾給與招待費，但彼等並不能代表政府及渠本人。（六）渠（孫氏）不主立院在京·穗兩地同時開會，渠認為果如此，乃一不幸事件。（七）如軍事上改革決定後，卽停止建軍，縱使和談決裂，在渠個人仍主張繼續裁軍，否則無以改善士兵待遇。</p>
<h3>改善公務員待遇希望自本月實施</h3>
<p>（八）公務員待遇，決按照當月各地生活指數發給，較前已改善許多，渠希望能在二月份起實施，但尙需財部核算後，始能決定。（九）對政治改革，渠認爲過去中央集權爲不智之舉，中央與地方事權應劃分，在憲法上亦有中央團地方均覆之規定，必須促其實現。除若干屬於中央範圍，如司法，國防等外，其他地方設施，應由民意之立法機構通過後，交地方政府執行，中央不應加以干涉，以實現民主政治。現財經改革新方案之公布，卽為開其首端，現由下糧食年度起，原來百分之卅繳付中央之田賦，已撥歸地方，此可使地方經費充裕，而從軍建設，並可减輕人民負擔。</p>

<h3>美產銀各州國會人士　注意我使用銀幣　國際貨幣基金會官員則不評論</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿五日電〕國際貨幣基金會官員，對於昨日宣布之我國財政與金融改革方案，在未獲正式通知之前，避免加以批評。我國政府旣再度鼓鑄與發行銀元，此間金融界一般猜測，中國請求美國予以白銀援助。基金會官員對於我國此次行動，表示相當驚奇，並預料卽可獲得我政府之正式通知。據悉：我政府對於此次改革，並未與基金會礎商，蓋此並非必需，代表美國產銀各州之國會人士，對於我國恢復白銀自由買賣與使用銀幣之舉，則加注意，曾提議以十五億貸予中國之參議負麥加蘭稱：中國所採使用白銀之措施，正適合其前次所提以五億至七億買賣白銀，穩定幣制之建議，然渠所提法案中，並未特別指明此點。產銀各州參衆兩院議員，願按可謂合法價格每英兩二角九分出售白銀，然美國財政部則以九角又半分之價格購買新出礦之白銀，市塲價格約爲七角。</p>
<h3>建設款尙未動用新的美援無接洽</h3>
<p>（十）中蘇商約原已簽訂，現仍有效，最近在新疆談判者，僅爲新省與蘇貿易問題，因兩年前伊寗等地發生問題，致使貿易停頓，現新省爲謀在平等互惠原則下恢復貿易，條件在磋商中。（十一）美國國會去年通過之二億七千五百萬美元中，規定有七千餘萬作爲建設之用，但此款現尙未動用，如何運用，亦未決定，使用時間，本定四月三日截止，但在原則上，屆時仍可延長，至新的美援，並無接洽。</p>
<h3>常州刼獄案</h3>
<p>〔太報武進廿六日電〕地院看守所在三牌樓匈城下，地稍荒僻，特建新監，昨晚九時半，突到便衣匪徒五人，爲首者用槍呼守崗潘國興，指定繳下佩槍，二匪監視，餘三匪則湧入所長黃維翰臥室，脅黃將手槍二支，長槍一支繳出，連同子彈廿餘發，金圓券三萬元，一併掠去，復將黃所長曁看守王慶迴，値夜吳恩澤等一併細綁，關閉於戒護室，剪斷電話綫，一面逼令主任看守郭覆夫，指明將監犯吳健（卅歲），黃明（卅歲），孫小海（廿七歲）三犯（均爲無錫指揮所以共同强劫公署獲案，判徒刑十五年重罪）　開足鐐，又貪汚犯判徒刑三年之前奔牛稅捐主任曹理靑，烟毒犯判刑七年之陳品章。葉才堂，（被判徒刑六年半），曁漢奸犯靳芳（被綏區判刑七年），以上七犯釋放後，卽帶同門崗潘國與，一併逸去。事後黃所長飛報憲兵隊，當出動軍警憲深夜出城，毫無所獲。據所內人稱：入內行事三匪，二匪原爲被釋監犯，一爲漢奸犯費國祥（吳興人），一月八日釋出，一爲倪德芳，（本邑湖塘橋人），去年十二月開釋，對監內極熟悉，故行動自如。事出後全城震驚，今晨派隊把守監所，黃所長及主任看守郭履夫，看守王慶迴發押澈究，城防部警局嚴緊査緝。丁兼綏靖司令適在常，對此極注視，並令嚴査破案。</p>
<h3>北平世界日晚報　被中共當局查封</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中共陜北電台廣播稱：立法委員成舍我所主辦之北平世界日報及世界晚報，已於廿五日由中共軍管會査封，査封理由爲「因爲這張報紙對人民解放事業抱仇視態度」。中共指成舍我爲「國民黨CC份子」，並謂此兩報「惡蹟昭彰」，按該報爲北平銷路最大之新聞紙。按：成氏於北平易手前，業已離平南來，刻正在滬。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿五日電〕北平被圍前原有日報廿餘家，「解放」時尙有十二家，現在祇剩新民報及人民日報兩家，人民日報係解放後成立，故原有報紙已僅餘新民一家。</p>
<p>〔又電〕電訊局宣布，卽日起記者發電均須付現，新聞證期滿之記者，僅許依照普通電報價目發電，普通電報較新聞電貴四倍，電訊局不允重行攷慮。</p>
<h3>蘇北共軍趕造大批木船　渡江準備益積極　泰縣靖江間公路已修通</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕江北共軍對渡江準備愈趨積極，僅揚州一地，據悉卽計劃建造木船二千艘，其中一部裝有汽車馬達或自柴油機碾米廠拆下之引擎，另自各地徵得木料二萬餘根，以應建造大量木船之用。又，泰縣至靖江間公路已修通，泰縣如皋間公路正搶修中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕龍潭對江六合東南方面土共千餘，廿二日向東溝及其附近竄擾，經大河口橋頭陣地國軍還擊後，共軍向六合城退去。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿六日電〕蘇省保安部今發表蘇北共軍動態稱：（一）共軍野戰部隊十六個縱隊，刻在蘇北各地積極整補。（二）共軍第一軍分區一·二·三·團及泰縣獨立團，於本月十六日竄刁家舖·大泗莊·塘灣一帶，積極搶修兩泰公路。（三）蘇北共軍似仍作渡江凖備，東台興化等縣米廠及各型柴油機全被征用，改裝民船，高郵。寶應湖附近集結帆船三百餘艘，在南通及天生港一帶亦積極造船。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿六日電〕據悉：蘇魯皖共軍近發動婦女趕做軍鞋三百萬雙運動，蘇北一地攤做一百萬雙，限期一個月完成。又，蘇北共軍近將通如一帶妓女二百餘名集中受訓，聞受訓完畢後，將派往江南一帶做地下工作。又，如　之公敎人員一千餘人，已送往東台受訓。</p>
<h3>北平蘇聯領館　悄然停止辦公　蘇領事及館員仍留平</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿六日電〕此間蘇聯領事館於一星期前悄然停止辦公，但領事鐵契文斯基與其他館員仍留平。蘇聯此舉理由不明，一般認爲蘇方欲表示其與中共並無關係。另一說爲蘇聯預料中共將在北平設立中國臨時政府，蘇聯倘不承認，蘇聯官員不宜留平，但此說絕不能證實。鐵契文斯基並未參加法領事白禮雅最近召開之領事團會議。本月廿二日華盛頓誕辰紀念舞會，鐵氏亦未露面，其他各領事則均參加。共方宣布換發汽車執照，但不規定外僑領照辦法，鐵氏在第一批停用汽車外國人之列。蘇聯領館門外之銅牌，係於一星期前除去，引起一般人疑惑，但蘇領事及領館其他人員不欲說明理由。旋蘇僑前往領館換領護照及接洽其他事務，始知已停止辦公。</p>
<p>〔又電〕各國領事館外形勢已見緩和，共軍衛兵許人自由進出，並不禁人携帶包裹，亦不强迫下車步行。</p>

<h3>人民的和平條件</h3>
<p>— 孟公亮</p>
<p>國共雙方素以代表人民相號召，且曾大聲疾呼的實行民主，在此次和平運動聲中，雙方都提出了條件。這些條件，可說是雙方的條件，或者說是代表人民的條件。但是人民心目中的和平條件，必非上述條件所能包括無遺。所以雙方除了自己提出的條件外，應該虛心接受人民提出的條件，作爲和平的最高原則，才是民主的表現。假若屛除人民合理的條件，一概不問，大家以爲惟我獨尊，要叫人民把他們所提出的條件，視同詔旨給音，金科玉律，那就太不民主了。</p>
<p>我是一個無拳無勇，無權無勢的，最平凡的中國人民，我願本乎良心，提出兩個自問必爲廣大人民贊成的條件，籲請全國人民批評討論，並予以贊成，同時，籲請雙方在朝在野從事和平運動的人們，將這兩個條件，列入「和談」範圍之內，作為人民的條件。</p>
<p>這兩個條件是：</p>
<p>（一）國內戰爭停止後，必須實施一個全國三十年建設計劃，即是六個連統的五年建設計劃：此一建設計劃，民生建設應佔百分之六十以上之成數。</p>
<p>（二）在實施全國三十年建設計劃期間，任何困難情形之下，不許發生內戰，更不許參加世界戰爭。</p>
<p>上述第一個條件，當然可以無條件博得全國的贊成，至於第一個條件，或許有人要問：「戰爭都是敵方逼出來的，我們爲自衛，難道也不許有戰爭」？我要正吿當道各方：中國人民，除有特殊地位者外，無不怨惡戰爭。不過因爲政權控制的能力有高低，民衆表達反戰的情緒也高低不同罷了。我一向處在民間，深知民衆痛恨戰爭，畏懼戰爭之情，隨時隨地，湧現出來，實在無法遏止。所以我勸諸公，切勿再以戰功自矜自喜，要多多的聽聽民衆的意見，體貼民衆的愈見。</p>
<p>一國的執政者，如要誠心避免戰爭，並不是絕對不能達到目的。例如：土耳其在第二次世界大戰，公開受英美的援助，又訂英法土協定，有非參戰不可之勢，但終於並未參戰。西班牙佛朗哥政權的成立，完全得力於德義，及至第二次世界大戰爆發，佛朗哥竟置身事外，速直佈羅陀也懶得收回。可見一個國家的執政者，祗要有誠心，有毅力，不受外力的引誘壓迫，確是可以避免戰爭的、以上二事，或者微末不足爲訓，請再翻一翻蘇聯的建國史。</p>
<p>一個政治力量的開創者，更不需要戰爭；因爲對外戰爭的震撼顚簸，可以影響政治的强固性，而毀壞了多年的艱難締造。蘇聯開國偉人列寗，於革命成功之後，不　織土的削割，和列强的包圍敵視，極力避免對外戰爭，致全力於整理內部，終於蘇聯建設的宏規懋績，輝煌照耀。蕭規不遠，深望我國起而效法，使失掉了淸未維新，民元革命，北伐完成，抗日勝利四大建設　　的中國，於內戰停止後，努力建設，叫老百姓忘掉近百年來政治改革所給與老百姓的痛苦，　潤些革命的幸福。</p>
<p>關於第二個條件，更可作一明確的詮釋，即是：倘若蘇美間起了戰爭，中國絕不參加任何一方面作戰，中國仍照預定的程序，進行三十年的建設。和平會議必須有人民代表參加，人民代表必須將此點鄭重表明，記入紀錄，使美蘇兩國，瞭然中國之志願，對於中國之建設，皆敢出以大胆的協助，至少；對於技術人員及機器原料，源源向中國運輸或物物交換，以加速中國的建設。若由中國的表明不參戰，而使蘇美緊張情緒，日漸綏和，消弭戰爭，實爲我人最大的希望，亦爲全世界人類最大的幸福。不幸美蘇出於一戰，中國當然繼續建設，而需要兩方機器物資，各作戰國則需要中國的原料及日用品，彼此交易，必定轉盛，或更有利於中國之建設。不過中國對外貿易，須以國家利益爲出發點，某方物物交換條件，較為有利，則某方交易自可獲優先成功。屆時標明此點，以免雙方疑有偏袒之處。</p>
<p>預料第三次大戰設果不幸而不能避免，勢將非常殘酷　　　。誰要將中國引入戰禍，難在百姓心目中，就是一個罪　。中國決定不參　，如有外力侵入中國，必須　定不參戰精　，運用　切可能的方法，將大事化小，使他不至釀成正式戰爭。許多人預測，下次世界大戰發　，當必最近中國邊境。中國政府，應先　　聲明，無論何國　　　侵入中國領土者，中國必以　　將之驅出境外，但　俟該侵入軍隊退出境外，中國即認爲「事件」業已結束。在驅逐入境軍隊前後，中國與該國並不斷絕國交或宣戰，藉以維持中國不參戰之態度。以上不過我個人的假設，但深信必爲全國人民所贊同。當第二次大戰之時，土耳其西班牙抱定不參戰態度，尙能維持中立，倘中國抱定不參戰主張，並將此項信念，昭吿世界，我們可以相信，作戰雙方必將尊重中國的意見，而不致侵犯中國之中立。</p>
<p>不參加世界大戰，爲中國人民之願望，亦係中華民族迫切之需要。西洋文化輸入中國將及百年，中國人希望帶來些幸福，並未達到目的，反受了一世紀的文明災害！請袞袞諸公，拿出謀國忠心來！將國家建設三十年，在三十年的建設時代內，切勿參加任何世界戰爭。這是對政權本身，中國人民，全世界人類，有百利而無一害的。</p>
<p>和平務須澈底，人民的和平條件放在第一！</p>

<h3>「中國的派爾」活躍在華中前綫</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員房滄浪</p>
<p>〔本報孝感十六日訊〕派爾是美國的一位道地的戰地記者，在二次世界大戰時，隨軍遠涉重洋，到東南亞戰地工作，他始而和美國兵活在一起，終於和美國兵在一次登陸戰時，殉職敵前。他死去已四年有餘，而我們還留在中國的內戰塲地，不死不活，想起來眞覺可羞而又可悲，所以當武漢同業集團向華中前綫跨步，我也很樂意的追隨這一羣「中國的派爾」，朝前一步，向那位永恒活在聯合國軍民心窩的派爾看齊。看看在這個時候這個塲合，有沒有「老百姓的軍隊」出現去聽聽那老百姓的心聲。</p>
<p>在飢餓綫上聽人民心聲</p>
<p>二月二十一日的早晨十點鐘，記者追隨武漢十四位同業，由洪口大智門，乘平漢鐵路特備的一節頭等臥車，欣然北上，時當大雪初齊，寒風砭骨，幸賴路局隨車照料的張平處長，劃總派同聯絡的隋參謀，陳專員，張股長，以及梁兵團聞訊派來聯絡的張秘書，照應格外，熱情洋溢，車廂中益覺溫暖。開車前，我們看看那些塞滿在二等車廂堆滿在那無蓬敝車的乘客，迎風瑟縮，咸表關切。後來詳詢張平處長，明瞭平漢路局的嚴重煤荒以後，又不禁爲這一班跑單幫的乘客，表示慶幸。可憐這一條橫貫中國大陸南北，長達一千二百公里的平漢鐵路，路長祇剩下三百零八公里，（由漢口至駐馬店）而因爲煤荒路短，開支大，收入少，待遇低，使車頭吃不飽黑飯，員工吃不飽白飯，變成了一條冰冷的飢餓綫，還要負起那艱巨的軍公運輸的重担子，這樣的工作精神，眞是難得，這應該歸功於夏光宇局長能以身作則。據車上負工談：最近該路所仰給的萍煤和楊梅山的煤，都不易運濟，所幸劃總方面對於該路的煤荒及秩序，很關心線减輕他們一點痛苦。</p>
<p>在飢餓綫上掙扎的人，最關心的是和平問題。我們聽到由漯河以北共區來的人說：那邊不許人民談和平，大家頗以爲異，都覺和平之神離開我們還很遙遠。其實，在這條飢餓綫上，雙方距離只差五十六公里，（駐馬店距漯河五十六公里，鄭州共區已通車至漯河。）如能停戰接軌，不需月餘時間，就不打而通，就可做出「放下屠刀，立地成和。」天大好事，寄語好戰的人們，上帝賜予你的智慧，父母遺給你的肉體，吃飯生出來的氣力，只應殺魔鬼，不可害生靈！</p>
<p>踏雪到橫店看軍民買賣</p>
<p>由漢口到黃陂縣屬的橫店，計卅公里，車行一小時卽達，這是我們訪問的第一目的地。我們下車後，踏着泥和雪，應邀參加該鎭各界歡迎茶會，傾聽民衆的心聲。我們從彭鄉長和商會林理事長的口中，以及在政工處所管部隊購買油肉定量證的上面，首先瞭解在這個地區裏軍民融洽之由來。這裏凡屬某兵國的部隊，每天採買油類肉類等物，必須先至政工處，依照實需領取購買證，然後再憑證至商店，照市價優待約打八折付現購物。這是兩相情願的一個避免軍民糾紛的開明做法。這裘的政工同人，顯然已揚棄了那不合時宜的賣膏藥作風，實心實地，在軍民之間，從事造橋工作，面他們成功的主要原因，是由於官兵對政工有較好的興趣，部隊有嚴整的紀律，整個大兵團，從司令部至連排，經濟都可公開，當官的不喫當兵的血，是張淦將軍手訂的鐵的紀律。違犯道一個信條，那就要跪到士兵面前當靶子打。</p>
<p>橫店是黃陂在平漢綫上第三大鎭，屬孝友鄉，轄十四個保，鎭上居民不足一千，鄉區人口多至五萬餘，米油是農產物的大宗，特產有牛羊皮，地雖已近江城，人還相當老實。我們一行，於下午三時離鎭乘車，轉往兵團司令部的所在地。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕陸軍部今夜宣布，美國在遠東方面駐軍，決定維持一年前十二萬七千人之數。阿拉斯加方面兵力則當增加一倍。日來外間謠傳陸軍當局有减少遠東駐軍說，陸軍參謀次長克林斯茲特招待記者，重申陸軍部長羅雅爾之聲明，謂美國擬堅守遠東防綫。記者問遠東方面美軍負有所謂「軍略的任務」，是否具有被攻時不惜一戰之意。克氏答稱，「日本如被攻，而美軍仍駐在其地，余可担保，美軍必定作職」。記者問十二萬七千兵力是否足够？克氏置之不答，僅稱，其答案須視許多因素而定。記者與克氏之問答，着重於陸軍部報吿書節略中遠東與歐陸兩方面戰鬥部隊多寡懸殊情形。遠東方面全部駐軍中，軍略部隊佔百分之八十八，歐洲方面僅佔百分之七十二，該節略稱，「戰爭結束之後，麥帥卽奉命担負軍略上保衛日本之任務。麥帥爲此乃維持一種軍略的機構，中備最大限度之戰鬥部隊。惟此重部隊現多用於保衛各地軍事機關職務，一旦有事，自可立卽調集担任軍略任務。德境美軍司令克　原無此種任務，迄至最近始有之。」據杜魯門總統預算規定美國武裝部隊員額不得超過六十六萬七千人，其中二十五萬八千人駐於國外，其數與一年前相爭，去年十一月則咸至二十三萬人。下屆財政年度國外駐軍分配情形如下：</p>
<p>遠東：預定十九萬人，去年十一月份十三萬人，一年前十二萬七千人。</p>
<p>阿拉斯加：預定一萬三千二百人，去年十一月份五千九百九十一人，一年前七千人。</p>
<p>太平洋（以夏威夷爲主）：預定七千人，去年十一月份八千二百七十四人，一年前九千人。</p>
<p>歐洲：預定九萬二千人，去年十一月份八萬五千七百卅四人，一年前九萬六千人。</p>
<p>特里雅斯特：預定五千人，去年十一月份四千八百九十八人，一年前五千人。</p>
<p>加利賓海：預定一萬四千人，去年十一月份一萬四千四百八十九人，一年前一萬四千人。</p>
<p>按照此項計劃，美軍在國內駐五個師，在國外駐五個師，其中遠東四師，歐洲一師，惟各師兵力並不完全足額。</p>

<p>當陸軍部參謀次長克林斯宣佈「如日本被攻，美軍必將作戰」後不久，羅雅爾卽在席問答之廣播中，表示上項觀點。羅雅爾稱：渠「完全同意」克林斯的聲明</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿六日電〕據此間外交觀察家廿六日稱：美國現較「羅雅爾爭論」開始前，保證在亞洲採取更堅强的立塲，同時，麥師在日本之地位，亦已加强。某外交人仕指出：在通去，由於華府與東京官員間的歧見，美國的對日政策，舉棋不定，但本日美國陸軍部參謀次長克林斯在華盛頓發出的聲明，已明確指出：如日本被攻，美軍將起而作戰。克林斯的聲明，已使此間許多担心一旦戰爭爆發，渠等將被棄於困境，並且因曾與美國佔領軍合作而遭受共產黨處罰的許多日本人仕，如釋重負。</p>

<h3>市長月薪美金六元　公教人員待遇菲薄熱望政府公佈改善</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕生活不斷高漲之下，薪水階級之生活已瀕絕境，公敎人員待遇與生活程度之脫節現象，乃旣成事實。擦此新經濟方案公佈，公敎人員待遇調整辦法尙未決定以前，記者會就本市市政府所屬官長及職工之本月份薪津，作一統計，結果得知吳市長月入一萬七千四百元，折合銀幣十一元零六角，按昨日市塲價格折算美金，爲六元另三角。此外各局長以底薪不同，酬給路有上下，平均月入一萬六千餘元，副局長平均月入一萬五千餘元，處長則得一萬元左右，而首級科負薪給，僅在五千元左右，其他下級職工待遇之菲薄，由此可見一斑矣。</p>
<p>按上列待遇數字，係底薪乘公敎人負生活指數所得，而底薪在六十元以上者，尙須按政府所公佈之辦法酌打折扣。吳市長之底新爲六百八士元，經打折扣後，僅合二百三十二元，乘以本月份發表之京滬區公敎人員生活指數七十五倍，計得一萬七千餘元。公敎人員除應得之薪津外，每月尙有實物配給，計煤球二祖，食米五斗，食油三斤，鹽二斤半，如不領實物者，可折合差額金，依當日市價計算之，約値二萬元左右。惟因配給時吿脫期，於實際無大補益。故屆此新經濟方案公佈，政府頒佈公敎人員待遇將重行調整之際，全滬公敎人員無不熱烈期待，俾生活得有合理之改善。</p>

<h3>President Chiang Has Completely Abandoned All Political and Military Affairs</h3>
<p>Tang Enbo's Interview with Foreign Reporters</p>
<p>[United Press, This City] General Tang Enbo believes that Chiang Kai-shek has completely abandoned China's military and political affairs. Tang told United Press reporters on the 26th that rumors that Chiang Kai-shek is still "commanding affairs" through daily contact with military and administrative officials are incorrect and unfounded. At the same time, General Tang pointed out that there may be some basis for believing that President Chiang has not completely retired in some respects, but Tang emphasized that this is not due to President Chiang's personal actions, but due to some of his subordinates. Some of President Chiang's subordinates may maintain contact with some parties in Nanjing to stay informed. Tang also said that President Chiang is like the manager of a large company who, after managing it for many years, completely abandons his business, but his subordinates still maintain contact with the business.</p>

<h3>After Crossing the River and Surrendering to the Communist Army, Zhang Qi's Unit Was Completely Disarmed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] It is reported that Zhang Qi's unit of a certain division of the National Army, which crossed the river and surrendered to the Communist Army, was recently transferred to the vicinity of Wuwei, where they were completely disarmed by the Communist Army, and their food supply was insufficient. The officers and soldiers complained endlessly and blamed each other.</p>
<h3>The National Army Has No Intention of Destroying the Tunnels and Bridges on the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>The CCP Radio Broadcast Is a Misrepresentation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 26th] The statement, broadcast three times by the CCP, that "the National Army will destroy the Wushengguan Tunnel (173 kilometers south of Xinyang to Hankou) and the Changtaiguan Huaihe River Bridge (329 kilometers north of Xinyang to Hankou) on the Pinghan Railway" is now reported by the railway authorities to be a misrepresentation. About a week ago, a small team of National Army engineers was active on the Huaihe River Bridge, trying to take defensive measures in case of emergency, but they left immediately. As for Wushengguan, no explosives have ever been planted there, because there is no need for it at present, and it will not be done in the future.</p>
<h3>President Sun Advocates Continuing Military Reduction; The Key to Stabilizing Prices Lies in Whether There Can Be Peace; The Balance of Power Between the Central and Local Governments Must Be Promoted to Realize It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, said at a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters at 11 AM on the 26th that the new financial and economic reform plan has been announced, but some important issues related to financial improvement are still under active discussion, such as: (1) The issue of military reform. The original National Army had 6.3 million people, which was later reduced to 5 million, and finally decided to reduce to 4.2 million. However, this number is still difficult to bear given the current financial situation. Therefore, reducing the army and saving military expenditure is an urgent matter. What is currently under discussion is the issue of military service reform. Some people advocate abolishing the conscription system and changing it to a voluntary system, but it needs to be studied in detail before a decision can be made. (2) The new financial and economic plan is only a temporary measure to stabilize prices, but to cure the root cause, there are still many problems that are being actively discussed and gradually implemented. Whether the current price fluctuations and inflation can be curbed depends on whether there can be peace. If peace is hopeless, there will naturally be greater difficulties. However, both sides have now expressed their intention to negotiate. Although no reports have been received on the progress of Shao Lizi and others, he believes that the prospects for peace must be very optimistic. On this trip south by President Li, preliminary decisions have been made on the above-mentioned important issues, especially on the issue of conducting peace talks. Sun also immediately stated that he would go to Nanjing in a day or two to discuss in detail with all parties again.</p>
<h3>If the Legislative Yuan Resumes in Nanjing, Sun Will Attend to Report</h3>
<p>As for the issue of the Executive Yuan moving back to Nanjing, no decision has been made yet, because peace has not yet reached a suitable time. In response to reporters' inquiries, he finally said: (1) The accusation against Minister Liu Weichi for corruption is a rumor and is currently under investigation. (2) He has not yet seen Liu's letter asking him to resign and cannot answer. (3) If it is determined that the Legislative Yuan will resume in Nanjing, he will attend to report. (4) The Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou was with the consent of Acting President Li and was not done without authorization. (5) Wu Yuhao and others went to Beiping purely out of their own initiative. The Executive Yuan did provide them with hospitality expenses, but they cannot represent the government or himself. (6) He (Sun) does not advocate that the Legislative Yuan hold meetings in both Nanjing and Guangzhou at the same time. He believes that if this is the case, it would be an unfortunate event. (7) If a decision is made on military reform, military construction will be stopped. Even if the peace talks break down, he personally still advocates continuing military reduction, otherwise there will be no way to improve the treatment of soldiers.</p>
<h3>Hope to Improve the Treatment of Civil Servants Starting This Month</h3>
<p>(8) The treatment of civil servants will be paid according to the cost of living index in various places in the current month, which is much better than before. He hopes to implement it starting in February, but it still needs to be approved by the Ministry of Finance before a decision can be made. (9) Regarding political reform, he believes that the past centralization of power was unwise. The powers of the central and local governments should be divided. The constitution also stipulates that the central and local governments should have balanced power, and it must be promoted to realize it. Except for certain areas that belong to the central government, such as justice and national defense, other local facilities should be implemented by the local government after being approved by the legislative body of public opinion. The central government should not interfere in order to realize democratic politics. The announcement of the new financial and economic reform plan is to start this trend. Starting from the next grain year, the 30% of the land tax originally paid to the central government has been allocated to the local government. This can make local funding abundant, and military construction can reduce the burden on the people.</p>

<h3>Congressional Figures from Silver-Producing States in the United States Are Paying Attention to Our Use of Silver Coins; Officials of the International Monetary Fund Are Not Commenting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] Officials of the International Monetary Fund are avoiding criticism of our country's fiscal and financial reform plan announced yesterday before receiving formal notification. Since our government has once again cast and issued silver dollars, financial circles here generally speculate that China is requesting silver assistance from the United States. IMF officials expressed considerable surprise at China's action and expect to receive formal notification from our government soon. It is reported that our government did not consult with the IMF on this reform, which is not necessary. Congressional figures representing silver-producing states in the United States are paying attention to our country's restoration of free trade in silver and the use of silver coins. Senator McCarran, who proposed lending $1.5 billion to China, said that China's adoption of silver measures is suitable for his previous proposal to buy and sell silver for $500 to $700 million to stabilize the currency system, but his proposed bill did not specifically specify this point. Senators and representatives from silver-producing states are willing to sell silver at a so-called legal price of 29 cents per ounce, but the US Treasury Department buys newly mined silver at a price of 90.5 cents, while the market price is about 70 cents.</p>
<h3>Construction Funds Have Not Been Used, No New US Aid Has Been Contacted</h3>
<p>(10) The Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty has already been signed and is still valid. The recent negotiations in Xinjiang are only about the trade between Xinjiang Province and the Soviet Union. Due to problems in Yining and other places two years ago, trade was suspended. Now Xinjiang Province is seeking to resume trade on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and the conditions are under negotiation. (11) Of the $275 million passed by the US Congress last year, more than $70 million is earmarked for construction, but this amount has not been used yet, and how to use it has not been decided. The deadline for use was originally set for April 3, but in principle, it can still be extended at that time. As for new US aid, no contact has been made.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Jailbreak Case</h3>
<p>[Taibao, Wujin, 26th] The detention center of the District Court is located under the Xiong City in Sanpailou, a slightly remote place. A new prison was specially built. At 9:30 last night, five plainclothes bandits suddenly arrived. The leader used a gun to call out to guard Pan Guoxing, ordering him to hand over his pistol. Two bandits monitored, while the other three bandits rushed into the bedroom of Warden Huang Weihan, forcing Huang to hand over two pistols and one rifle, along with more than 20 rounds of ammunition and 30,000 gold yuan notes, all of which were looted. They then tied Warden Huang and guards Wang Qinghui and Wu Enze, who were on night duty, and locked them in the security room, cut the telephone line, and forced Chief Guard Guo Fufu to point out the prisoners Wu Jian (30 years old), Huang Ming (30 years old), and Sun Xiaohai (27 years old) (all of whom were sentenced to 15 years in prison for jointly robbing the public office by the Wuxi Command). They opened their fetters and released Cao Liqing, the former Benniu tax director who was sentenced to three years in prison for corruption, Chen Pinzhang, a drug offender sentenced to seven years in prison, Ye Caitan (sentenced to six and a half years in prison), and Jin Fang, a traitor (sentenced to seven years by the Sui District). After releasing the above seven prisoners, they took guard Pan Guoxing with them and fled together. Afterwards, Warden Huang flew to report to the Military Police Corps, which dispatched military police and gendarmerie to leave the city late at night, but found nothing. According to people inside the prison, of the three bandits who entered the prison, two were former prisoners who had been released, one was the traitor Fei Guoxiang (from Wuxing), who was released on January 8, and the other was Ni Defang (from Hutangqiao in this county), who was released in December last year. They were extremely familiar with the prison, so their actions were smooth. After the incident, the whole city was shocked. This morning, a team was sent to guard the prison, and Warden Huang and Chief Guard Guo Fufu, and guard Wang Qinghui were arrested for thorough investigation. The city defense department and the police局 were tightly investigating the case. Ding, who is also the Commander of the Pacification, is paying close attention to this and ordered a strict investigation to solve the case.</p>
<h3>The Beiping World Daily Evening News Was Shut Down by the CCP Authorities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to a broadcast by the CCP Shaanbei Radio Station, the Beiping World Daily and World Evening News, organized by legislator Cheng Shewo, were shut down by the CCP Military Control Commission on the 25th. The reason for the shutdown was that "this newspaper harbored a hostile attitude towards the cause of people's liberation." The CCP referred to Cheng Shewo as a "KMT CC element" and said that the two newspapers had "obvious evil deeds." It is reported that the newspaper had the largest circulation in Beiping. Note: Cheng had already left Beiping and came south before Beiping changed hands and is currently in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 25th] Before Beiping was besieged, there were more than 20 daily newspapers. There were still 12 newspapers at the time of "liberation." Now there are only two newspapers left, Xinmin Daily and People's Daily. The People's Daily was established after the liberation, so the only original newspaper left is Xinmin Daily.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Telecommunications Bureau announced that starting today, reporters must pay cash for telegrams. Reporters whose press passes have expired are only allowed to send telegrams at ordinary telegram rates. Ordinary telegrams are four times more expensive than news telegrams. The Telecommunications Bureau does not allow reconsideration.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Is Rushing to Build a Large Number of Wooden Boats; Preparations for Crossing the River Are Becoming More Active; The Highway Between Taixian and Jingjiang Has Been Repaired</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Communist Army in Jiangbei is becoming increasingly active in preparing to cross the river. In Yangzhou alone, it is said that they plan to build 2,000 wooden boats, some of which are equipped with car motors or engines dismantled from diesel-powered rice mills. They have also requisitioned more than 20,000 pieces of wood from various places to build a large number of wooden boats. In addition, the highway between Taixian and Jingjiang has been repaired, and the highway between Taixian and Rugao is being rushed to repair.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] More than a thousand local bandits in the southeast of Longtan, Liuhuo, crossed the river and harassed Donggou and its vicinity on the 22nd. After the National Army on the Dahekou Bridgehead counterattacked, the Communist Army retreated to Liuhuo City.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 26th] The Jiangsu Provincial Security Department today announced the movements of the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu: (1) The sixteen columns of the Communist Army's field troops are actively reorganizing and replenishing in various parts of northern Jiangsu. (2) The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments of the 1st Military Sub-district of the Communist Army and the Taixian Independent Regiment infiltrated the area of Diaojiapu, Dasizhuang, and Tangwan on the 16th of this month, actively rushing to repair the Liangtai Highway. (3) The Communist Army in northern Jiangsu seems to be still preparing to cross the river. Rice mills and various types of diesel engines in counties such as Dongtai and Xinghua have all been requisitioned to convert civilian ships. More than 300 sailboats are gathered near Gaoyou and Baoying Lake. Shipbuilding is also being actively carried out in Nantong and Tiensheng Harbor.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 26th] It is reported that the Communist Army in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui has recently launched a campaign for women to rush to make 3 million pairs of military shoes. 1 million pairs are being made in northern Jiangsu alone, with a deadline of one month.

It is reported that after the training is completed, they will be sent to the Jiangnan area to do underground work. In addition, more than 1,000 public and educational personnel from Rugao have been sent to Dongtai for training.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Consulate in Beiping Quietly Stopped Working; The Soviet Consul and Staff Are Still in Beiping</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 26th] The Soviet Consulate here quietly stopped working a week ago, but Consul Tichvinsky and other staff are still in Beiping. The reason for the Soviet Union's move is unclear. It is generally believed that the Soviet side wants to show that it has no relationship with the CCP. Another theory is that the Soviet Union anticipates that the CCP will establish a temporary Chinese government in Beiping. If the Soviet Union does not recognize it, Soviet officials should not stay in Beiping, but this theory cannot be confirmed. Tichvinsky did not participate in the recent consular corps meeting convened by French Consul Ballereau. Tichvinsky also did not appear at the Washington's Birthday Memorial Dance on the 22nd of this month, but other consuls all participated.

<h3>The People's Peace Terms</h3>
<p>— Meng Gongliang</p>
<p>Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have always claimed to represent the people and have loudly proclaimed the implementation of democracy. In this wave of peace movements, both sides have put forward conditions. These conditions can be said to be the conditions of both parties, or the conditions representing the people. However, the peace terms in the minds of the people must not be fully encompassed by the above-mentioned conditions. Therefore, in addition to the conditions they have put forward, both parties should humbly accept the conditions put forward by the people as the highest principle of peace, which is a manifestation of democracy. If reasonable conditions of the people are ignored altogether, and everyone thinks they are the only one that matters, demanding the people to regard their proposed conditions as imperial edicts, golden rules and jade laws, then that is too undemocratic.</p>
<p>I am the most ordinary Chinese person, without power or courage, without rights or influence. I am willing, in good conscience, to put forward two conditions that I believe will be supported by the vast majority of the people. I urge the people of the whole country to criticize and discuss them and give them their support. At the same time, I urge those who are engaged in the peace movement, whether in power or out of power, to include these two conditions in the scope of "peace talks" as the people's conditions.</p>
<p>These two conditions are:</p>
<p>(1) After the cessation of domestic war, a national thirty-year construction plan must be implemented, that is, six consecutive five-year construction plans: in this construction plan, livelihood construction should account for more than 60% of the achievements.</p>
<p>(2) During the implementation of the national thirty-year construction plan, under any difficult circumstances, civil war must not occur, and participation in world wars is even more forbidden.</p>
<p>The first condition mentioned above can of course unconditionally win the support of the whole country. As for the first condition, some people may ask: "Aren't wars forced by the enemy? For self-defense, are we not allowed to have wars?" I want to solemnly tell all parties in power: Chinese people, except those with special status, all resent war. However, the ability to control political power varies, and the public's expression of anti-war sentiment also varies. I have always been among the people and deeply know that the public's hatred of war and fear of war emerge anytime and anywhere, and cannot be suppressed. Therefore, I advise you, gentlemen, not to be complacent about military achievements, but to listen more to the opinions of the people and be considerate of the people's wishes.</p>
<p>The rulers of a country, if they sincerely want to avoid war, are not absolutely unable to achieve their goal. For example, Turkey, in World War II, openly received aid from Britain and the United States, and also signed the Anglo-French-Turkish agreement, which made it seem inevitable to participate in the war, but in the end, it did not participate. The establishment of Franco's regime in Spain was entirely due to Germany and Italy, but when World War II broke out, Franco stayed out of the war and did not even bother to recover Gibraltar. It can be seen that as long as the rulers of a country have sincerity and perseverance, and are not seduced or oppressed by external forces, they can indeed avoid war. The above two examples may be insignificant and not worth learning from. Please turn over the history of the Soviet Union's nation-building.</p>
<p>The founder of a political force does not need war even more; because the shock and upheaval of foreign wars can affect the strength of politics and destroy years of hard work. Lenin, the great founder of the Soviet Union, after the success of the revolution, strongly avoided foreign wars despite territorial cuts and encirclement and hostility from the great powers, and devoted all his efforts to internal consolidation. Finally, the grand plans and magnificent achievements of the Soviet Union's construction shone brilliantly. The example is not far away, and I deeply hope that our country will rise up and follow suit, so that China, which has lost the four major construction opportunities of the late Qing Dynasty's reform, the Revolution of 1911, the completion of the Northern Expedition, and the victory in the Anti-Japanese War, can strive for construction after the cessation of civil war, and make the people forget the pain that political reforms have given them in the past century, and taste some of the happiness of the revolution.</p>
<p>Regarding the second condition, a clearer interpretation can be made, that is: if a war breaks out between the Soviet Union and the United States, China will never participate in the war on either side, and China will still proceed with the thirty-year construction program according to the planned procedure. People's representatives must participate in the peace conference, and the people's representatives must solemnly state this point and record it, so that the United States and the Soviet Union will understand China's aspirations and dare to provide bold assistance to China's construction, at least; continuously transport technical personnel, machinery, and raw materials to China or exchange goods to accelerate China's construction. If China's declaration of non-participation in the war gradually eases the tense emotions between the Soviet Union and the United States and eliminates war, it would be our greatest hope and the greatest happiness for all mankind. Unfortunately, if the United States and the Soviet Union engage in a war, China will of course continue construction, and both sides will need Chinese machinery, materials, and raw materials. Trade between the warring countries will definitely become more prosperous, which may be more beneficial to China's construction. However, China's foreign trade must be based on national interests. If one party's barter conditions are more favorable, then that party's transaction can be given priority. This point should be clearly stated at that time to avoid suspicion of partiality from both sides.</p>
<p>It is expected that if a third world war unfortunately cannot be avoided, it will be very cruel. Whoever brings China into the war will be a sinner in the eyes of the people. China has decided not to participate. If foreign forces invade China, it must adhere to the spirit of not participating in the war and use all possible methods to reduce the major events to minor ones, so that it does not lead to a formal war. Many people predict that the next world war will break out closest to the Chinese border. The Chinese government should first declare that no matter which country invades Chinese territory, China will definitely drive it out of the country, but after the invading army withdraws from the country, China will consider the "incident" to have ended. Before and after expelling the invading troops, China will not break off diplomatic relations or declare war on that country, so as to maintain China's attitude of not participating in the war. The above is just my personal assumption, but I firmly believe that it will be supported by the people of the whole country. During World War II, Turkey and Spain maintained their neutrality by adhering to their attitude of not participating in the war. If China adheres to the principle of not participating in the war and announces this belief to the world, we can believe that the warring parties will respect China's opinions and will not infringe upon China's neutrality.</p>
<p>Not participating in a world war is the wish of the Chinese people and the urgent need of the Chinese nation. Western culture has been introduced into China for nearly a century. The Chinese people hoped that it would bring some happiness, but this goal has not been achieved. Instead, they have suffered a century of civilized disasters! Please, gentlemen, show your loyalty to the country! Build the country for thirty years, and do not participate in any world war during the thirty-year construction period. This is beneficial to the regime itself, the Chinese people, and all of humanity, and there is no harm.</p>
<p>Peace must be thorough, and the people's peace conditions must be placed first!</p>

According to reliable sources, the semi-official representative of the CCP in Hong Kong has assured the British authorities that the CCP authorities do not intend to launch any public movements to demand a solution to the Hong Kong issue, nor do they intend to support any covert operations (such as strikes) to undermine this prosperous commercial port. The source also stated that although the Communist Party reserves full freedom of action at an appropriate time in the future, they hope that the Hong Kong issue will be resolved through diplomatic channels. This issue has attracted considerable attention from the Hong Kong and London British authorities, because the takeover of Hong Kong, although currently a theoretical issue, may become a de facto issue this year. Hong Kong, whether internally or externally, is vulnerable to attack and must rely on the support of the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>"China's Ernie Pyle" Active on the Central China Front Line</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Fang Canglang</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xiaogan, 16th] Ernie Pyle was a true American war correspondent. During World War II, he followed the army across the ocean to work in the Southeast Asian war zone. He initially lived with American soldiers and eventually died in action during a landing operation. He has been dead for more than four years, but we are still stuck in the Chinese civil war, neither dead nor alive. Thinking about it, I feel ashamed and pathetic. Therefore, when the Wuhan colleagues group stepped towards the Central China front line, I was happy to follow this group of "China's Ernie Pyles," taking a step forward to emulate Ernie Pyle, who lives eternally in the hearts of the UN soldiers and civilians. Let's see if there is a "people's army" appearing at this time and place to listen to the voices of the people.</p>
<p>Listening to the Voices of the People on the Hunger Line</p>
<p>At ten o'clock in the morning on February 21st, I followed fourteen colleagues from Wuhan, took a special first-class sleeping car on the Pinghan Railway from Hongkou Dazhimen, and happily headed north. It was early in the heavy snow season, and the cold wind was piercing. Fortunately, Chief Zhang Ping from the Railway Bureau, who was taking care of us on the train, Liaison Staff Sui, Commissioner Chen, Section Chief Zhang, and Secretary Zhang, who was sent by the Liang Corps upon hearing the news, provided extra care and warmth. The enthusiastic atmosphere made the train car feel even warmer. Before the train departed, we saw the passengers crammed into the second-class carriages and piled up on the open wagons, shivering in the wind, and expressed our concern. After inquiring with Chief Zhang Ping in detail, we learned about the serious coal shortage of the Pinghan Railway Bureau and could not help but express our sympathy for these passengers running their own businesses. It is pitiful that this Pinghan Railway, which runs north and south across the Chinese mainland for 1,200 kilometers, has only 308 kilometers left (from Hankou to Zhumadian). Due to the coal shortage, the line is short, expenses are high, and income is low, resulting in low salaries, so the locomotives cannot get enough black coal, and the employees cannot get enough white rice, turning it into a cold hunger line. Yet it still has to shoulder the arduous task of military and public transportation. This kind of work ethic is truly rare and should be attributed to Director Xia Guangyu's ability to lead by example. According to the workers on the train, it has been difficult to transport the Pingxiang coal and Yangmei Mountain coal that the railway relies on. Fortunately, the General Planning Office is very concerned about the railway's coal shortage and order, alleviating their pain a little.</p>
<p>People struggling on the hunger line are most concerned about the issue of peace. We heard people from the Communist-controlled areas north of Luohe say that people there are not allowed to talk about peace, which everyone found strange, feeling that the god of peace is still far away from us. In fact, on this hunger line, the distance between the two sides is only 56 kilometers (Zhumadian is 56 kilometers from Luohe, and the Communist-controlled area of Zhengzhou has opened to traffic to Luohe). If a ceasefire could be achieved and the tracks connected, it would not take more than a month to open the line without fighting, and it would be a great thing to "lay down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha on the spot." Tell the warmongers, the wisdom God gave you, the body your parents left you, and the strength you gained from eating, should only be used to kill demons, not to harm living beings!</p>
<p>Walking Through Snow to Hengdian to See Military-Civilian Trade</p>
<p>From Hankou to Hengdian, which belongs to Huangpi County, it is 30 kilometers, and the journey takes one hour. This is our first destination. After we got off the train, we stepped through mud and snow and were invited to attend a tea party held by people from all walks of life in the town to listen to the voices of the people. From the mouths of Township Head Peng and Chairman Lin of the Chamber of Commerce, as well as from the oil and meat rationing certificates purchased by the troops under the Political Work Department, we first understood the origins of the harmonious relationship between the military and civilians in this area. Here, whenever troops from a certain military corps purchase oil, meat, and other items, they must first go to the Political Work Department to obtain purchase certificates according to their actual needs, and then go to the stores with the certificates to purchase goods at preferential prices, about 20% off the market price. This is an enlightened approach that avoids military-civilian disputes. The political work colleagues here have obviously abandoned the outdated style of selling snake oil, and are wholeheartedly engaging in bridge-building work between the military and civilians. The main reason for their success is that officers and soldiers have a better interest in political work, the troops have strict discipline, and the economy of the entire corps, from the headquarters to the companies and platoons, can be made public. Officials do not exploit the soldiers, which is the iron discipline set by General Zhang Gan. Violating this creed means kneeling in front of the soldiers and being shot at as a target.</p>
<p>Hengdian is the third largest town on the Pinghan Line in Huangpi, belonging to Xiaoyou Township, and governs 14 Bao. There are less than 1,000 residents in the town, and the rural population is more than 50,000. Rice and oil are the main agricultural products, and the specialty is cattle and sheep hides. Although the place is close to the Jiangcheng city, the people are still quite honest. Our group left the town at 3 p.m. and took the train to the location of the Corps Headquarters.</p>

<h3>Army Vice Chief of Staff Solemnly Announces: U.S. Determined to Defend the Far East Defense Line; Decision to Maintain 127,000 Troops in the Far East; Troops in Alaska to Be Doubled</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] The Department of the Army announced tonight that the United States has decided to maintain the number of troops stationed in the Far East at 127,000, the same as a year ago. The number of troops in Alaska will be doubled. In response to recent rumors that the Army Department intends to reduce the number of troops stationed in the Far East, Army Vice Chief of Staff Collins hosted reporters and reiterated the statement of Secretary of the Army Royal, stating that the United States intends to defend the Far East defense line. When asked by reporters whether the U.S. military in the Far East is responsible for a so-called "strategic mission" and whether it means that it will not hesitate to fight if attacked, Collins replied, "If Japan is attacked and the U.S. military is still stationed there, I can guarantee that the U.S. military will do its duty." When asked by reporters whether 127,000 troops are sufficient, Collins did not answer directly, only saying that the answer depends on many factors. The reporters' questions to Collins focused on the discrepancy in the number of combat troops in the Far East and Europe in the summary of the Army Department's report. Strategic troops account for 88% of all troops stationed in the Far East, while only 72% in Europe. The summary stated, "After the end of the war, MacArthur was ordered to take on the strategic mission of defending Japan. For this reason, MacArthur maintained a strategic organization with the maximum number of combat troops. However, most of these troops are currently used to protect the duties of military institutions in various places and can be immediately mobilized to take on strategic missions in the event of an emergency. General Clark, commander of the U.S. military in Germany, did not have this mission until recently." According to President Truman's budget, the number of U.S. armed forces should not exceed 667,000, of which 258,000 are stationed abroad, which is the same as a year ago. Last November, the number reached 230,000. The distribution of overseas troops for the next fiscal year is as follows:</p>
<p>Far East: Projected 190,000, 130,000 in November last year, 127,000 a year ago.</p>
<p>Alaska: Projected 13,200, 5,991 in November last year, 7,000 a year ago.</p>
<p>Pacific (mainly Hawaii): Projected 7,000, 8,274 in November last year, 9,000 a year ago.</p>
<p>Europe: Projected 92,000, 85,734 in November last year, 96,000 a year ago.</p>
<p>Trieste: Projected 5,000, 4,898 in November last year, 5,000 a year ago.</p>
<p>Caribbean: Projected 14,000, 14,489 in November last year, 14,000 a year ago.</p>
<p>According to this plan, the U.S. military will station five divisions domestically and five divisions abroad, including four divisions in the Far East and one division in Europe, but the strength of each division is not fully staffed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] U.S. Army Vice Chief of Staff Collins said on the 25th that the United States will reduce the number of troops stationed in Korea and the Philippines. Alaska is the only area where the Army wants to increase troops.</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal Says: Soviet Union Unlikely to Attack Japan; He Believes Current Situation is More Relaxed Than a Year Ago</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] Secretary of the Army Royal said on the 26th that the U.S. military will rise up and fight if Japan is attacked. At the same time, he believes that the U.S. military will be able to resist the Soviet Union or any country and defend Japan. But he immediately said, "I don't think the Soviet Union will attack Japan. At the same time, I don't think war is imminent. On the contrary, the current world situation is more relaxed than a year ago."</p>
<p>Royal expressed the above views during a question-and-answer broadcast shortly after Army Vice Chief of Staff Collins announced that "the U.S. military will definitely fight if Japan is attacked." Royal said that he "completely agrees" with Collins' statement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] According to diplomatic observers here on the 26th, the United States has taken a stronger stance in Asia than before the "Royal Controversy," and MacArthur's position in Japan has also been strengthened. A diplomat pointed out that in the past, due to differences between officials in Washington and Tokyo, the United States' policy toward Japan was hesitant. However, the statement issued by U.S. Army Vice Chief of Staff Collins in Washington today has clearly pointed out that the U.S. military will rise up and fight if Japan is attacked. Collins' statement has relieved many Japanese people here who were worried that they would be abandoned in distress in the event of war and would be punished by the Communist Party for cooperating with the American occupation forces.</p>
<h3>Part of the U.S. Military Withdrawing from China Arrives in California</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Diego, California, 26th] Part of the U.S. Marines withdrawing from China has arrived here aboard the Navy transport ship Henrico. Commander Thomas of the U.S. Marine Corps in the Western Pacific and his subordinates were also on board. The Asian Command has announced its end, and its westernmost outpost is now Guam. Thomas declined to discuss the situation in China and the significance of the withdrawal of the troops.</p>

<h3>Finnish Cabinet Crisis</h3>
<p>Opposition Party Criticizes Closeness to Britain and the United States</p>
<p>[United Press, Helsinki, 25th] The Finnish cabinet is facing a crisis today. The opposition party leader warned that Finland is in increasing danger after Norway's closeness to the West, and the government should step down immediately to form a coalition government. Under this pressure, the minority party government of Prime Minister Fagerholm seems unlikely to hold on.</p>
<h3>India Convenes Five Commonwealth Nations to Discuss Military Aid to Burma; Evatt and British Overseas Trade Minister Both Attend</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London 26th Broadcast: An outsider said that the conference of nations scheduled to be convened by Nehru on the 28th will discuss whether the Commonwealth countries can assist in resolving the Burmese civil war. British officials revealed that the British government has provided economic assistance to the Burmese government, part of which is for the purchase of military supplies, but officials believe that given the current precarious situation in Burma, economic assistance alone is not enough to solve the problem. British officials believe that at the New Delhi conference, India and Pakistan may suggest taking more direct action.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 25th] The Indian government announced today that the five British Commonwealth countries—Britain, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Australia—will meet here next Monday to discuss the issue of whether to provide military aid in response to the Burmese civil war. It is also rumored that the issue of Burma rejoining the British Commonwealth will be discussed. Burma completely broke away from British rule and became independent a year ago.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 25th] The Indian government announced on the 25th that it has proposed convening a meeting of representatives from neighboring Commonwealth countries to consider the interests of Britain, India, and Pakistan arising from the recent developments in Burma. In addition to broader issues, the issue of Burmese rice exports may be discussed. Governments of various countries and the Burmese government have maintained close contact. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt and British Overseas Trade Minister Bottomley have come to New Delhi this week, so the Indian government has proposed "considering the Burmese situation."</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] Foreign Office officials said on the 25th that the New Delhi conference to discuss the Burmese issue is scheduled to be convened on February 28. This conference is a consequence of Burma's request for economic assistance to carry out its anti-communist movement. The official said that Burma made a request for assistance to Britain several weeks ago, and the British government immediately discussed the matter with other Commonwealth countries. As far as we know, this conference will only deal with economic matters. Diplomatic circles say that this New Delhi conference is unlikely to be the prelude to the establishment of an anti-communist agreement by the Commonwealth countries, but the Commonwealth countries are determined to drive communism out of Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>Fierce Fighting in the South of Mandalay</p>

<h3>Galicia Autonomous Province Proposal: Guangdong Expresses Firm Rejection; Yugoslavia Secretly Adds Room for Compromise</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London 26th Broadcast: Yugoslavia said today that it may be willing to abandon half of its territorial claims against Austria. The Southern government did not formally and in detail explain its position, but a booklet issued by the Southern Embassy in Britain today may imply the Southern country's attitude. The booklet suggests that the Trava River be the final border. When the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers meets next Monday, Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber will attend and present his arguments. Gruber has informally told representatives of Western countries that Austria cannot accept Yugoslavia's proposal for Galicia's autonomy.</p>
<h3>Italian Deputy Prime Minister Suddenly Resigns</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Rome, 26th] Italian Deputy Prime Minister Saragat resigned today. Saragat is a minority leader of the Italian Socialist Party. The main reason for his resignation is disagreement with the cabinet's foreign policy. Some members of the Socialist Party oppose the government's participation in any conventions that entail military obligations. After this incident, the Socialist Party's Steering Committee immediately held a meeting to discuss the matter. However, so far, it has not been possible to predict the impact of Saragat's resignation on internal affairs.</p>
<h3>France Takes Action to Arrest Communists</h3>
<p>Four Individuals Involved in Leaking Secrets Face More Serious Charges</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] Police raided the offices of communist newspapers on the 25th, and the government will prosecute the communist "elder" Cachet, possibly on charges of treason. Prime Minister Guy Mollet has begun a nationwide crackdown on the Communist Party after Thorez declared in Parliament that the French would not fight against Soviet troops invading France. The Ministry of Justice has asked Parliament to strip Cachet of his parliamentary privileges. He is a member of parliament and the host of the main French Communist newspaper "L'Humanité."</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 26th] Fifteen French communists were arrested yesterday and interrogated by local security forces. Four of them may be tried by military tribunals. These four are Yu Ying, the editor-in-chief of the communist weekly "Regards"; the reporter Freideland; Peng Yilao, the manager of another communist weekly "France d'Abord"; and Yona, an employee of the National Aviation Construction Association. According to police sources, the three news professionals have proven to have leaked information about national defense plans.

<h3>America is Very Comfortable, But Not the Most Touching Country</h3>
<p>Strong Answers Reporters' Questions After Trial</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 25th] Pro-Soviet American writer Strong, who was expelled from the Soviet Union for espionage, said on the 25th that he was apparently suspected by "minor Soviet officials" for asking questions as a journalist. He chatted casually with reporters in federal court for three-quarters of an hour after being tried before a jury investigating communist activities in the United States. He said that he had never been a spy for any country, and he enthusiastically maintained his American citizenship. When asked if he had ever sworn to renounce his American citizenship, he said, "I am very careful about my nationality. What I am most proud of is the American citizenship my parents gave me." He was accompanied by his lawyer Rogers. Rogers said that Mrs. Strong would give the jury "full cooperation." When asked if he was happy to return to the United States, Mrs. Strong replied, "I like to go anywhere I can sleep. I think America is the most comfortable country we have ever lived in, but not the most touching country. After a period of rest, maybe after a period of writing, I think I will go to a country where there is war." (Note: Strong has expressed his willingness to come to China.)</p>

<h3>Netherlands Advocates Convening Round Table Conference; Indonesia's Response is Not Enthusiastic; United Nations Spokesperson Calls it Irrelevant</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York Broadcast Batavia News: The Indonesian and United Nations sides did not respond enthusiastically to the news that the Netherlands intends to convene a round table conference to discuss the Indonesian issue. A United Nations spokesperson denounced the proposal as empty and irrelevant. Another senior United Nations official criticized the restoration of freedom to the Indonesian Republic leaders, saying that although the Dutch have decided to lift restrictions on the freedom of action of Indonesian leaders, they do not necessarily allow them to return to Yogyakarta or recognize them as government officials. The Indonesian Republic stated that the Dutch statement did not guarantee an independent and autonomous Indonesia in accordance with the United Nations plan. The spokesperson said that if the Republic leaders accept the invitation to participate in the round table conference, the result may be that they will be abandoned to the guerrillas who are currently engaged in combat.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 26th] The Dutch government issued a communique today stating that the Dutch government has decided to take the initiative to convene a round table conference in The Hague on March 12.

<h3>If Soviet Troops Enter Italian Territory, Italian Communists Are Willing to Fight Shoulder to Shoulder; Remarks of Italian Communist Leader Are One Step Further Than Those of French Communists</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 26th] Italian Communist leader Togliatti said today that if Soviet troops pursue aggressors in Italian territory, the Italian Communist Party will fight shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet army.

<h3>British Labour Party National Executive Committee Meeting; Drafts Outline of Future Government; Prepares for 1950 Election</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] Prime Minister Attlee and key cabinet members will hold a secret meeting over the weekend. They will decide in a country villa in southern England whether to seek national consent for a plan for comprehensive socialization or to adopt a "gradual" policy. All members of the Labour Party National Executive Committee will participate in the discussion. The weekend meeting, convened by Attlee, will draft the Labour Party's plan for the next five years for the future Labour Party Congress. This plan will form the basis of the Labour Party's platform in the next general election. A fierce struggle will inevitably occur at the meeting between proponents of nationalization, led by Minister of Public Health Bevan, and moderates, including Prime Minister Attlee and Deputy Prime Minister Morrison. According to current indications, the moderates in the cabinet will prevail. Proponents of comprehensive nationalization advocate that shipbuilding, the chemical industry, the insurance industry, sugar and other food production and distribution should all be nationalized. Moderates believe that they have already taken comprehensive nationalization measures, including railways, coal mines, electricity, medicine, and road transport, and are currently promoting a plan for steel nationalization. If this bill is passed by Congress, the Labour Party can declare to voters that they have fulfilled all the guarantees they made to voters in the 1945 election. If the Labour Party wins again, it will focus on consolidating these socialization efforts. They believe that the best winning strategy in the next election will be an attack on prices and a guarantee of improved services for children's well-being.</p>

<h3>Import Control System to be Maintained; Relaxed Import of Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange; Liu Weichi Discusses New Measures to be Implemented After Presidential Decree</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weichi, after arriving in Shanghai from Guangzhou a few days ago, convened a meeting of the standing directors of the China Textile Construction Corporation yesterday and met with visiting reporters. According to the discussion: The main task of this trip is to inspect the business situation of various units under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the improvement of the Import Control Commission. He will stay in Shanghai for about two or three days before proceeding to the capital on official business.</p>
<p>Regarding import control policies, Mr. Liu stated that since the announcement of the new financial and economic plan, various implementation details are being drafted. The key points of this import control policy improvement are: (1) opening up self-provided foreign exchange; (2) relaxing imports as much as possible, except for luxury goods, especially for production equipment, as long as the source of self-provided foreign exchange is legitimate, imports will be relaxed as much as possible; (3) providing the most reasonable official exchange rate for export foreign exchange in the future, in order to earn more foreign exchange for the country. The list of luxury or consumer goods that should be prohibited from import is currently being drafted. As for the quota import goods of the previous fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth quarters, they will continue to be processed according to the original regulations. In short, this reform will maintain the import control system, and the Import Control Commission will also remain. The new import control measures after the improvement will be implemented after the presidential decree is issued.</p>
<p>Regarding various reports in the newspapers, Mr. Liu stated yesterday that "they are all untrue." He said that he did not want to argue about this matter, because the Control Yuan is currently conducting an investigation of the entire case, and a conclusion will be reached soon. As for the armed personnel going to the newspaper office for questioning about this matter, he is currently directing the Textile Construction Corporation to thoroughly investigate. If it is indeed done by the personnel of the Textile Construction Corporation, and if there is any transgression, strict punishment will be imposed without leniency.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Compiles Index; Director Cao States Denial</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Social Affairs Bureau Director Cao Peizi yesterday solemnly denied the rumors that the compilation of the city's employee cost of living index will be handled by the Statistics Office of the Social Affairs Bureau in the future. Director Cao stated: The Statistics Office of the Municipal Government, due to insufficient personnel, transferred two or three people from the Statistics Office of the Social Affairs Bureau to assist in the work, and the techniques are being guided by the Statistics Office of the Municipal Government, rather than the Statistics Office of the Social Affairs Bureau being responsible for the compilation. The work of compiling the employee cost of living index will continue to be the responsibility of the Statistics Office of the Municipal Government as before.</p>
<h3>Silver Shops Set to Reopen on the 28th; Profit Margin Should be Reduced</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] After the announcement of the financial and economic reform plan allowing the free trading of gold and silver, representatives of the silver shop industry yesterday went to the Social Affairs Bureau with a petition to meet Director Cao Peizi, requesting to resume business on the 28th, and proposing to set the labor cost and legitimate profit of jewelry at 10%. After Director Cao consulted with Mayor Wu and contacted the Gold Control Bureau, he believed that there was no such thing as reopening or not for the silver shops, and agreed to the request. However, because no central government order has been received yet, if the central government makes any changes to the regulations on the sale and purchase of jewelry in the future, it should be followed. As for labor cost and legitimate profit, Director Cao hoped that it would be lower than 10%, and instructed the industry to review and submit a detailed report before proceeding.</p>

<p>After the announcement of the new economic plan, prices suddenly fluctuated greatly again. Commodities such as rice, sugar, gauze, and daily necessities have all risen sharply, and people's livelihoods have been increasingly threatened. However, under the high prices, the actual sales of various industries have greatly declined. Yesterday, reporters visited several large department stores and witnessed the tragic situation, which is rare in previous price surges. An executive of a department store said: Yesterday's total door sales were not even enough to purchase food for all the employees, which shows the decline in the purchasing power of the citizens. In addition, the actual sales of general manufacturers and wholesalers have not improved. At present, it is fortunate that the speculative transactions of general hoarding merchants are used to maintain the situation.</p>

<h3>Supervisory Committee Administration Holds Symposium; Preliminary Investigation of Relief Fund Case; Mayor Wu and Others Invited to Attend and Report</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] In order to conduct a preliminary investigation into the suspected embezzlement of relief funds by the Northeast Material Handling Committee, the Supervisory Committee Administration of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces held a symposium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., presided over by Deputy Dean Liu Zhe, and invited Wu Guozhen, Yang Zhuoan, Wu Huanzhang, and representatives of the Central Bank to attend and report separately. In addition to Wu Huanzhang sending a representative to the meeting to state the handling process, he also submitted a detailed written report. Wu Guozhen explained that the distribution of relief funds to refugees from the Northeast was not related to his duties. Because the masses gathered at the Central Bank at that time and the order could not be maintained, he had to expediently release the 31 million yuan in cotton yarn mortgages from the association for the sake of public security. In order to conduct further research, the Administration decided to continue to convene a review committee tomorrow to review various reports, and Wu Huanzhang will be invited to attend and explain again at that time. Yesterday, before the meeting of the Administration, refugees from the Northeast who remained in Shanghai rushed to inquire about the situation, and dispersed one after another from 9:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu's Reply Regarding Corruption of Foreign Personnel</h3>
<p>It was reported in the city's newspapers a few days ago that in a United Press dispatch from New York on the 23rd, Dr. Jiang Tingfu, China's representative to the United Nations, said when speaking to members of the Overseas Press Club that "when he was the Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), 90% of the 300 foreigners working for him were Americans, and they were more corrupt than the Chinese personnel." American personnel who are still working for the Custodial Committee of the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission were very surprised to read the report, and Colonel An Yanshi, the current Deputy Director of the Fishery Administration, who used to be the Deputy Executive Director of CRRRA, telegraphed to inquire whether Mr. Jiang had made such a statement. According to Mr. Jiang's reply, "The United Press report is inaccurate. I only said that among the 300 foreign personnel, there were also cases of corruption, and some cases were more serious than those of Chinese personnel."</p>

<h3>Order for Collection of Commodity Tax in Kind Not Yet Received; Bureau Says Still Handled According to the Old System</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] According to the new financial and economic plan, commodity tax will be collected in kind in the future. Yesterday, reporters inquired with a person in charge of the Municipal Commodity Tax Bureau about the preparations for the reform.

Before the formal order has been received, the tax will still be collected according to the old system. However, it is believed that when the implementation details are issued, they will be followed immediately. However, since the Ministry of Finance has moved to Guangzhou, it takes a lot of time for official documents to travel back and forth, so the formal order may still have to wait.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Monthly Salary is Six US Dollars; Low Salaries for Government Employees; Strong Hope for Government to Announce Improvement</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] With the continuous rise in the cost of living, the lives of salaried people are already on the verge of collapse. The gap between the salaries of government employees and the cost of living has become a reality. Before the measures for adjusting the salaries of government employees are decided after the announcement of this new economic plan, reporters made a statistics on the salaries of officials and employees of the Municipal Government for this month. The result showed that Mayor Wu's monthly income is 17,400 yuan, equivalent to 11 yuan and 6 cents in silver coins, which is equivalent to 6 US dollars and 3 cents according to yesterday's market price. In addition, the salaries of other bureau chiefs vary depending on their base salaries, with an average monthly income of more than 16,000 yuan, deputy bureau chiefs an average monthly income of more than 15,000 yuan, and division chiefs about 10,000 yuan. The meager salaries of lower-level employees are evident from this.</p>
<p>The above salary figures are the result of multiplying the base salary by the government employee cost of living index. Those with base salaries above 60 yuan must also be discounted according to the measures announced by the government. Mayor Wu's base salary is 680 yuan, which is only equivalent to 232 yuan after the discount. Multiplying by 75 times the Jinghu area government employee cost of living index announced this month, the result is more than 17,000 yuan. In addition to their due salaries, government employees also receive monthly in-kind allocations, including two coal balls, five dou of rice, three catties of cooking oil, and two and a half catties of salt. If they do not receive in-kind items, they can convert the difference into cash, calculated according to the market price of the day, which is worth about 20,000 yuan. However, due to delays in distribution, it is of little practical benefit. Therefore, as this new economic plan is announced and the government is about to readjust the salaries of government employees, all government employees in Shanghai are eagerly awaiting a reasonable improvement in their lives.</p>
<h3>Scholarship Fundraising Ends; Donation Figures Being Calculated</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] During the City Education Week, the Shanghai, Asia-America, and Victory Radio stations mobilized personnel from the city's entertainment industry to hold an on-air scholarship fundraising broadcast for two days, which ended at 2:00 a.m. this morning.

The Garrison Headquarters Radio Monitoring Section and the Telecommunications Bureau also notified the public and private radio stations accordingly. However, public radio stations such as United, Tiansheng, Shengli, Xinwen, Yuanzheng, Tiefeng, and Xinsu, as well as private radio stations such as Wanchang and Jindu, continued to broadcast their commercial programs as usual on the fundraising day, which greatly affected the scholarship fundraising work. The organizers expressed their regret over this. The detailed figures of the funds raised are still being collected and calculated, so they could not be known yesterday.</p>

<h3>Fire at Dongbinxing Road Destroys Six Houses</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A car repair shop at No. 950, Dongbinxing Road, North Shanghai, caught fire accidentally at around 10:45 yesterday morning. Because the interior was filled with rubber products and gasoline and engine oil, which are all flammable materials, once ignited, it immediately turned into a prairie fire. In addition to the destruction of the house at No. 950, it also affected six adjacent households at Nos. 952, 954, 956, 948, and 946, all of which were destroyed, resulting in heavy losses. The Fire Brigades of the first, second, and third sections of Zhabei rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which was extinguished after an hour and a half. The cause of the fire is being investigated by the police sub-bureau in charge.</p>
<h3>Tenants' General Federation Posts Slogans Opposing Landlords' Unauthorized Rent Increases; Draft Rent Standard Being Formulated by the Land Administration Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Tenants' General Federation posted slogans on the streets yesterday, publicizing opposition to landlords' unauthorized rent increases, opposing rent calculations based on physical gold, foreign currency, or cost of living index, and demanding that the Land Administration Bureau promptly announce rent standards. A reporter visited Shen Zhenjia, the acting director of the Land Administration Bureau yesterday. It is understood that the bureau is widely soliciting opinions from all parties and drafting reasonable standards, preparing to submit them to the municipal council next week, and then send them to the municipal council for discussion and approval before implementation. This draft rent standard will stipulate several calculation methods, which will be selected by the municipal council and the municipal council. As for the issue of calculating rent based on physical objects or gold, the Executive Yuan has already issued a ban. If rent is calculated in foreign currency, the new financial reform plan prohibits the circulation of foreign currency, which is also a violation of the law. However, in fact, this phenomenon is widespread. However, from a judicial point of view, the lease contract is agreed upon by both parties, and if there is no dispute, it is actually impossible to prohibit it. Regarding the issue of calculating rent based on the cost of living index, the base number is extremely difficult to reasonably determine, and the authorities are still studying and considering it.</p>
<h3>Regulations Committee of the Council Resolves to Request Strict Prohibition of Rent Calculation in Foreign Currency</h3>
<p>The Regulations Committee of the Municipal Council held its 36th meeting at the meeting hall at 3 p.m. yesterday, attended by councilors Yan Ersheng, Wang Zongying, etc., and Shen, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Sun, Director of the Police Bureau, and Chairman Ma Junshuo. The following important cases were resolved:</p>
<p>(1) The prohibition of calculating rent in foreign currency has already been resolved by this meeting and has been clearly stipulated in Article 6 of the Municipal Housing Lease Management Regulations. The Municipal Government should strictly implement it and send a letter to the Shanghai Local Court for strict handling. Resolution passed. (2) The Municipal Government was previously urged by the General Assembly to revise the maximum amount of rent in this city as soon as possible, but it has not yet been drafted. Should it be urged again? Resolution: A letter should be sent to the Municipal Government to promptly draft and complete it, and submit it to the meeting for review. (3) The Municipal Government's request to amend Article 3 of the Regulations on Penalties for Late Payment of Land Value Tax to increase the fine was approved. Resolution passed. (4) Single regulations implemented in this city that relate to the rights and obligations of the people should, in accordance with the law, be reviewed and approved by this council. The Municipal Government has not paid enough attention to this. How should it be handled? Resolution: A letter should be sent to the Municipal Government for strict implementation. (5) It is heard that the Municipal Police Bureau will increase the multiple of the fine for violating police regulations according to the cost of living index. Is there a legal basis for this? Resolution: A letter should be sent to the Municipal Government for inquiry.</p>

<h3>Tightening of Credit to Suppress Prices; Authorities Have Control Power; Separate Measures to Handle How to Price Gold and Silver; The Issue of Silver Dollar Exchanges by Banks and Firms Still Requires Detailed Study</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Finance Minister Xu Kan and President of the National Bank Liu Gongyun were originally scheduled to return to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, but due to weather unsuitable for flying, the return has been rescheduled for today and are expected to arrive at 4 p.m. The new financial plan will be implemented gradually starting tomorrow, after the two have consulted with the financial community. According to a person in charge of the National Bank: (1) The authorities have considerable control over tightening credit and suppressing prices. Whether it is materials or gold and silver, they can decide to sell large quantities at any time based on market conditions to suppress rising prices, so there is a sense of vigilance in the market, and speculators are somewhat intimidated. (2) The issues of how to control the buying and selling of gold and silver, and how to make the exchange rate between gold and silver dollars and Gold Yuan coupons reasonable, may be handled by other means. (3) The issues of how to handle foreign currencies and how to open up the method of importing foreign exchange will be implemented after consultation between the Import Management Committee, the National Bank, and the Finance Department. (4) The possibility of silver dollar deposits and exchanges by banks and firms still requires detailed study due to technical difficulties. There must be proper measures for the National Bank's silver dollars circulating among the people. (5) Whether the Gold Yuan coupons will continue to be issued in the future needs to be requested for instructions. Even if they continue to be issued, a principle of contraction will be adopted.</p>
<h3>Credit Shifts from Loose to Stable, with Dark Interest Rates Rising First and Then Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the trend of credit in this city shifted from loose to stable. The daily interest rate for interbank lending was priced between 45 yuan and 50 yuan in the morning. Near 10 a.m., credit turned slightly looser as price trends fluctuated, and the daily interest rate fell to between 35 yuan and 45 yuan. The average market interest rate for various industries was between 40 yuan and 50 yuan, with the food market priced lower, opening between 35 yuan and 40 yuan. The external interest rate in the securities market was 36 yuan to 40 yuan per day, and the National Bank's rediscount and daily interest rates remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Gold Bond Quotations Increased by 6,000 Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the National Bank's quoted price for short-term gold bonds was 114,500 yuan per tael. The city's various sales outlets sold a total of 97 taels of gold bond face value in the past two days. Since the start of sales on the 11th of this month, a total of 4,075 taels and 5 mace of gold bond face value have been sold as of yesterday.</p>
<h3>National Bank Has Not Sold Gold, Price Soars at Noon, Reaching a Maximum of 150,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Trading in the gold market was quieter yesterday compared to the previous days. It opened with various parties adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and the market was flat. Around 9:20, the price reached a minimum of 133,000 yuan to 135,000 yuan. Before 11:30 a.m., insiders were afraid that the National Bank would sell large quantities, so they hesitated to trade, and the gold shops were particularly deserted. However, by noon, there was still no news of the National Bank selling, and credit turned looser, and the exchange rate for settlement continued to rise, so the market rose sharply, closing at 140,500 yuan to 142,500 yuan at 12:30 p.m. There was no trading in the afternoon due to the weekend. However, because there were many intra-day positions to be settled among traders, there was more intra-day trading, and the price gradually rose to 148,000 yuan to 150,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Internal Exchange Rate Revised</h3>
<p>The internal exchange rate of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus and One Treasury will be revised from the 28th as follows: Changsha Hengyang 250 yuan each, Yuanling 300 yuan, Wuhan 300 yuan, Shashi Xuanyu 400 yuan each, Nanchang Jiujiang 200 yuan each, Jian 250 yuan, Changshu Jiangyin 50 yuan each, Jiaxing 30 yuan, Huzhou 40 yuan, Linhai Dinghai Daishan 100 yuan each, Shaoxing 40 yuan, Wenzhou Chongqing 300 yuan, Kunming 250 yuan.</p>
<h3>Northern and Cantonese Traders Inquire; Stock Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Due to financial and monetary reforms, and the prospect of implementation, concerns about credit tightening eased in people's minds yesterday. Northern and Cantonese traders all inquired, allowing the market to stabilize. Special stocks continued to stop at the limit by 11 o'clock, and Sinya and America also reached the limit one after another. Yongsheng Yarn stabilized around 3 yuan at around 11:30. Other stocks became more active, and Datong, Tongyi, Qinxing, Huafeng, Sino-French, Zhenqi, Xinhua, and Yongye all reached the limit in succession. Medium-level stocks were limited, with few available for sale. The initial price of Shanghai Cement was 90 cents. The high price of Yongsheng Yarn was 3.12 yuan, near closing. The low price was 2.73 yuan, in the morning. It rebounded by 38 cents compared to the previous day. Each stock rose by 2.7 cents to 17.70 yuan compared to the previous day. The total turnover was 4.15125 billion shares, including 137.5 million shares of Yongsheng Yarn, and 485 million shares of the growing and prosperous America.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Become More Popular</h3>
<p>The trend of foreign stocks is higher, because the rise of Chinese stocks is quite large, and credit was loose yesterday, so the rise was very strong. Yi Yarn traded at 6,000 yuan and 6,200 yuan, rising by more than 20% compared to the previous day. British Union traded at 6,700 yuan, Yi Beer traded at 1,000 yuan, Steel Company traded at 1,250 yuan, Asian Shipping traded at 600 yuan, and Wheelock was flat, trading at 1,600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market Stops Rising and Turns Down</h3>
<p>The cloth market stopped rising and turned down, because the sharp rise in recent days has been too severe, and people have become more cautious. After opening, all parties seemed to be thinking about activities, and they tried to pull it up, and the buying enthusiasm was revived. Near noon, news of selling air was transmitted to the market, and the market was unsupported and frustrated. Various cloths fluctuated at low levels, and the gains compared to the previous day were small. The leading fine cloth opened at 18,150 yuan, once soared to 18,800 yuan, and then fell back slightly near closing, finally settling at 18,100 yuan, down 1,700 yuan. The trumpet boy's fine cloth started at 17,100 yuan and closed at 16,900 yuan, down 1,400 yuan. B-leading fine cloth retreated sharply by 2,500 yuan. The four gentlemen's Yuan Biji opened at 17,100 yuan, once fell to 16,800 yuan, and then rebounded, finally closing at 17,000 yuan, down 1,700 yuan. Jinlian Miaowu Yuan Huaji also fell slightly by 1,700 yuan. The four gentlemen's Yuan Zhigong finally traded at 17,200 yuan, down 1,700 yuan compared to the previous day. The remaining colored cloths and printed cloths were hardly changed.</p>

<h3>The Allotment Limit for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Transported Southward in March: Agreement Reached Yesterday on Allocation Ratios: A Total of 11,500 Bales of Cotton Yarn and 907,000 Bolts of Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Transport Southward Allotment Review Committee held its second meeting at the Textile Construction Company yesterday at 3 PM. Chairman Song Lifeng presided. After discussions, the key points resolved were as follows: (1) The total production volume of cotton yarn for March was determined to be 115,000 bales. After deducting 28,750 bales to be submitted as US aid cotton yarn, 35,000 bales for the Textile Construction Company and privately-owned factories' own use, and 12,800 bales for export, there remains 38,450 bales. After deducting 26,950 bales for self-retention by the re-processing industry, the cotton yarn allotment limit available for southward transport in March should be 11,500 bales. The allocation of this limit is as follows: one-tenth for the Textile Construction Company, totaling 1,150 bales; four-tenths for privately-owned factories, totaling 4,600 bales; and five-tenths for yarn merchants, totaling 5,750 bales. (2) The total production volume of cotton cloth for March was determined to be 3,023,000 bolts. After deducting exports, military needs, and local re-processing, which together account for 70% of the total production volume, the remaining 30%, totaling 907,000 bolts, is the southward transport allotment limit for cotton cloth in March. The allocation of this limit is as follows: 40% for transport and sales merchants, totaling 362,800 bolts; 35% for the dyeing and weaving industry, totaling 317,500 bolts; 15% for privately-owned yarn factories, totaling 136,000 bolts; and 10% for the Textile Construction Company, totaling 90,700 bolts. (3) The southward transport ports are limited to Guangzhou, Shantou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Wuzhou. Taiwan is not included. (4) The various application forms for southward transport of cotton yarn and cloth, as well as the visa application forms, will be determined by the two commercial associations for cotton yarn and cloth after consultation, and then decided by the Joint Operations Office. (5) The above-mentioned resolutions will be implemented from March 1st. The allotment method for April will be discussed further.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Continues to Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn is trending firm. Because traditional tariffs will be slightly collected on books and documents, people's expectations are high, and holders are unwilling to sell, resulting in high asking prices. However, buyers are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach, so transactions are not seen as robust. As a result, the prices of various yarns continue to rise. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 770,000 yuan, once reaching a high of 825,000 yuan, before falling back to close at 800,000 yuan, up 60,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose 70,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon initially stood at 580,000 yuan, reaching a maximum of 610,000 yuan, and finally fell back to 590,000 yuan, ultimately rising 20,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods were bid up all the way from 475,000 yuan to close at 530,000 yuan. Factory orders rose 50,000 yuan, closing at 490,000 yuan. Trading on Monday opened at 520,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse initially opened at 440,000 yuan, closing at a high of 475,000 yuan at noon, a rise of 45,000 yuan. Other grades also generally rose by about 10%.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Weakens</h3>
<p>Tung oil, after several days of frenzied and rapid increases, suddenly turned soft on the market yesterday, with prices falling across the board by more than 5,000 yuan. The reason is that the positions of fellow traders showed a slight tightening, and the foreign exchange transfer certificate also fell sharply, causing people to suddenly lose momentum, and the process was difficult to sustain.</p>
<h3>Owners Take Advantage of High Prices to Sell: Rice Market Momentum Turns Back: Flour Rises, Coarse Grains Increase, Oil Market Stable</h3>
<p>The rice market is precarious at high prices, and prices are falling from their peaks. Because they had risen too much the previous day, owners took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the selling pressure was very strong. The market initially opened down 500-600 yuan, and at closing it was even weaker, finally falling 700-800 yuan. High-quality white japonica rice fell 800 yuan, opening at 13,800 yuan, medium-grade goods fell 1,000 yuan, and early rice fell 800 yuan. In the North Market, white japonica rice fell 600 yuan, closing at 14,000 yuan, and early indica rice fell 600-700 yuan. The total arrivals in the two markets were 8,104 piculs.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Initially opened steadily, and after a slight fluctuation, it rose because taxpayers actively participated. Soybean oil opened at 55,000 yuan, and slowly rose in the afternoon, reaching a maximum of 58,000 yuan. The closing price fell slightly to 57,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 54,000 yuan, each rising 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Jiangbei Jiton raw oil was 62,000 yuan, and old-barrel cooked rapeseed oil rose from 46,000 yuan to 48,000 yuan. Other oils generally rose by 3,000 yuan. Soybean cake was purchased by the Qingdao gang, rising 600-700 yuan. Changzi cake once reached 6,800 yuan, closing at 6,400 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour: Slightly increased. Initially, it once fell due to the decline of various items, but because credit was stable, the northern gang made considerable purchases. Although rice prices fell, people's confidence remained firm, and the market momentum finally rebounded. The warship initially fell 200 yuan, and at the close rebounded to 5,670 yuan. After the close, retail investors remained active, and owners raised prices, pushing the market higher again, finally trading at 5,750 yuan. Lao Che rose slightly by 100 yuan, and there was very little trading in the afternoon. Bran followed the rise, with large bags of Fuxin rising slightly by 250 yuan, closing at 4,600 yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains: Market momentum fluctuated upwards. At the beginning of the market, due to the decline in rice prices, the sales of soybeans were quite sluggish, and they fell slightly. Later, upon hearing of the rise in oil cake, they rebounded. The initial opening of Zha beans fell below the 10,000 yuan mark, but at the close rebounded to its original level. Holders of raw peanuts were unwilling to sell, and held on firmly, and there was no trading. The Qing gang actively purchased corn, and it rose again by more than 10%. Red sorghum sales were extremely sluggish, falling by about 10%.</p>
