<h3>張羣返京晉謁總統　聲明中央地方主張一致過長沙晤程潛圍爐歡談</h3>
<p>〔太報南京十日電〕應白祟禧電邀於八日專機飛漢之張羣，在漢晤白氏後，十日晨飛長沙，會見程潛主席，下午五時一刻仍乘自强號專機返抵京，當晚晋謁總統，報告此行經過，記者特迎候於機塲，張氏下機時，精神呈現愉快之狀，似能首先予記者以此行任務圓滿之表現。記者詢會見白·程兩氏後，是否有新的意見携回，張氏稱無。地方上之主張與中央之主張，乃係一致的。詢以鄂省參議會所號召之和平促進會情形如何，張氏答，業與鄂省參議會人士見面，知悉響應者已有兩省，詢其就渠所見該會是否可望召集成功，張氏稱，此乃彼等之自由。記者再詢以白氏是否可望於短期內來京一行，張氏稱，如有事，彼當可來。末記者再詢以目前和平調處事已進入邀請四國參加之途徑，是否有更進一步之成就，張氏稱，此事余僅見諸報端。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十日電〕張羣十日晨九時偕隨員周君亮等離漢飛湘，訪問程潛。白祟禧徐祖詒暨此間行政首長張篤倫，張軫，徐會之等均至機塲送行。張氏行前語記者稱；此次重遊舊地，至感愉快，所欲言者，已詳昨日書面談話，茲已無可奉告，所願電複一言者，卽全國上下之和平志願，確已完全一致，今後唯有循此目標，共同努力耳。又黃紹竑及自湘來漢迎接張氏之劉建緒均未飛湘，聞將在此小作勾留。張軫於送張羣之行後，再度謁白總司令，有所請示，旋於十一時許乘車赴信陽任所。據張氏在車站與本報記者談，華中平靜，岳軍（張羣）先生來漢後，一切謠言當可澈底澄淸。</p>
<p>〔本報長沙十日電〕政委張羣十日上午十時半飛抵長沙，下機後卽赴省府休息，與程潛圍爐歡談一小時，並召見各機關首長暨民意機關領袖，下午二時乘原機飛京，臨行接見記者，謂能戰始能和，關於外傳武漢方面之謠言，張氏鄭軍聲明完全不確，此種關言與報載總統赴台同樣無稽。本人此次與白總司令晤談，白氏與中央步驟完全一致，盼記者向滬方多所報道。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕日來京滬有一二報紙載稱，長沙綏署主任程潛將軍曾託國防部次長黃杰將軍於本月七日呈函總統，對時局有所建議，茲據黃將軍稱，上述傳說全非事實。</p>
<h3>在京立委談話會　對和平問題作廣泛討論</h3>
<p>〔本本報南京十日電〕一部在京立法委員，十日下午三時半舉行談話會，出席者約百餘人，公推王廣慶主席，若干委員首强調談話會之發言者祗能發表其個人意見，而不能作成任何決議，繼卽對和平問題作廣泛討論，發言者十九為東北籍，公開反對和平者僅有一人，餘多堅稱和平為人民利益所在，亦為國族命運所寄，立院為代表選民之委員組成，對和平所考慮者，唯係用何種方式，作何等努力，以爭取之而已。某委員聲言，如果為和平所需，渠願放棄在現今法統下所具有之立委身份。又一委員謂，政府在爭取和平之努力中，尙須作健全自身之工作。政治民主化，經濟社會化，軍隊國家化，皆所必需，外交政策亦須重行檢討。冬敎發言委員顯對和平抱極大期望，且認為期望之是否能成為事實，胥決定於忠國家愛八民者之努力程度。最後，某委員曾提議於本週內舉行擴大談話會，討論是否需要召開臨時會議，以對和平問題有正式表示，然未獲得結論，至五時許散何。</p>

<h3>鄧錫侯就職</h3>
<p>朱紹良闡述和戰要義</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十日電〕朱紹良十日在布達鄧錫侯就任新職儀式中，對和談曾有所闡述。渠强調要戰或和，端視軍人意志為轉移，北伐所以成功，因為參加人員一心一德，同生共死，有此精神，進可戰，退能和，若醉生夢死，則不要說和，卽跪在敵人面前也會遭淸算。朱認為鄧，楊，王等川宿將共同領導西南軍政，可使天府之國成為勝利堡壘。鄧致詞亦願力爭和平，以蘇民困。</p>

<h3>王世杰雷震在滬　並未視任和平聯絡員</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕王世杰及雷震來滬已數日，據雷震氏表示：外傳兩人來滬，乃担任上海和平聯絡員之責，並無此事。和平為人人所渴望，但在目前欲與中共談和，恐無可能。又外傳民盟恢復組織之說，據本人所知，民盟本身迄未提出此項請求。</p>
<h3>故都和平點滴</h3>
<p>〔木報北平九日電〕和平點滴：（一）日前康有為之女康同洹等曾呼籲保護故都文物，並函各國駐平領事協助，昨平美總領事柯樂柏已函覆，謂個人同情其計劃，惟為保持國際中立，未便干涉。（二）為了呼籲和平，要從一萬尺高空的飛機上跳傘自殺的瘋人孫少卿，頃又以所作「和平快」歌，投寄平市各報，該歌係倣「特別快車」，歌曲歌詞滑稽突梯。</p>

<h3>杜魯門未提出美對華新援助　國務院否認有攔阻援華計劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕杜魯門總統十一日在其預算咨文中，對美國新援華問題避免提及。杜魯門將此整個問題延宕至「日後」，顯然與外傳渠正在等候中國政府有何遭遇之說相合。國務院會否認有「擱住」援華之任何計劃，另一發言人强調稱：第八十屆議會所表決之兩項對華援助「每日」在進行中。該兩項援助一為一億二千五百萬元之軍事援助，二億七干五百萬元為經濟援助，二者大部份皆已動用，現在未予回覆之問題，乃為此兩項基金用罄後如何，杜魯門總統在其咨文中未透露此一問題，總統對西歐援助作特別請求後，渠稱，其他援助計劃之範圍及多少，在目前不能正確地預料，該計劃現包括對希，土，華及韓四國。一般認為杜魯門所用「現包括」之措辭乃伸後脚之機會，一官員稱：希。土兩國可獲新美援，一俟計劃草訂後，但渠拒絕對其他兩國之計劃加以猜測。</p>

<h3>救濟下一代的生命</h3>
<p>近日天氣嚴寒，上海市馬路上凍死屍體，日有數十具，甚或達百具以上，這是何等傷心慘目的事。據十日各報統計各慈響機關收殮凍屍數字，以九日一天的數字為準，計普善山莊收得童屍九十三具，成人屍五具；南市同仁轉元堂收得童屍三十四具，成人屍兩具；中區問仁輔元分堂收得童屍十具，成人屍一具。據普善山莊人員談稱：每天馬路收屍，小孩五六十具，成人四五具，為極普通之事。另據同仁輔元堂人員談稱。：該堂連日收屍已達三百具以上，最多之日，童屍達五十五具之多。這個統計數字說明了兩點：其一，上海市馬路上的凍屍，被發現收險的，每日達百具以上，而以童屍為最多；其二，氣候日轉寒冷，凍屍日益增加，而增加死亡率，則以童嬰棄屍為最多。</p>
<p>很顯然的，這是椿嚴重的社會問題，它說明人間世的悲劇，它說明亂世孤雛的命運歸於死亡。面對此情此景，政府當局和社會仁人志士，如不急救這一羣垂危中的孤雛，如不澈底辦理社會救濟，可痛的悲劇并不因氣候的轉暖而停止，人間世的悲慘，必是繼續發生而日益加深的。</p>
<p>要知道此項社會問題是怎樣發生的呢？根擄社會學和社會現象來說，此項社會間題發生在目前，至少有兩個原因。：第一是基於貧窮，第二是基於戰亂，如就兩者的相互關係而言，都市貧窮死亡原因的擴大，完全係基於戰亂。從社會歷史說，貧窮是造成戰亂的因，或者說，戰亂是造成貧窮的果。社會無貧窮，不會有戰亂；戰亂發生後，又無不影響社會的貧窮。從戰爭發展說，在一個戰亂的社會裏，無論前方與後方，生命的價値如草芥，男女老幼的生命，隨時拋置在鐵絲網，瓦礫廢壇，街頭路邊。所以說，戰爭不但摧毀了建設，毀滅了我們同代人的生命，而且埋葬了我們下一代的生命！最近上海有一張各叫「亂世孤雛」的影片，反映一羣孤兒在戰亂中的命運，他們遭受最殘酷的迫害，離開了父母和家庭，長久的被每辱與被損害，侵蝕了他們的童性，他們陰沉·低黯，他們恐懼·懷疑，最後他們失去了生命。很明顯的，這是人類下一代悲劇的寫照·上海市參議會在總統元旦文告之後，呼籲雙方停戰，其呼籲電文中，有「兩三年間，殺人盈哥，哀吾同胞，水深火熱，誰無父母？誰無兄弟？誰無夫婦？誰無兒女，壯者流亡四方，老關轉輾溝壑，人間地獄，觸目傷心」之句，更充分說明社會的貧窮，人間的離散，完全基於戰亂，完全根派於戰亂。</p>
<p>因此，為了急救現社會一羣垂危中的赤雛，為了澈底辦理社會救濟事業，在目前，首先要求國內的和平；有了國內的和平，纔有社會的和平；其次要求和平建設的環境下，釐定一個社會救濟制度，澈底實現社會保育保健，不僅要求保全同代人的生命，並且要求保育下代人的生命，至於目前上海街頭童屍拋棄之多，大部是貧窮人戶之棄嬰，而極少部份則為醫院中死去而無人收險的童嬰，這完全是社會貧窮所造成的現象。現在上海市當局正積極推行冬令救濟，而冬令救濟的目的，是救濟貧窮，援助貧窮人戶渡過嚴寒的冬季，因而我們希望上海市的救濟委員會及慈善機關，正視道一椿嚴重的社會問題，在同情，慈愛的兩大信念之下，迅速設法救濟這一羣垂危中的赤雛！要之，下一代的生命同一代人類的生命可貴。我們今天的職責，不僅為了要保全同一代生命，要求實現國內的和平，社會的和平，並且需要保全下一代子孫的生命，使他們的童性·心靈格外健壯，不饟西伯利亞的寒流夭折了他們！</p>
<h3>國民黨紀念週上　內政部長洪蘭友　首次施政報告　對吏治等八端分作簡要闡述</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕國民黨中央黨部今晨舉行紀念週，馬超俊主席，內政部長洪蘭友作就任後之首次施政報告。洪氏就吏治·地方自治·警政·警政·禮俗·營建，方域·禁政等八端分別作籍要報告。</p>

<p>關於地方自治，洪氏稱，欲推進地方自治，必先健全基層組織。今後對於基層組織應力求其健實，按照總理地方自治開始實行法，斟酌地方情彩督策實施。　談及警政時，洪氏謂警政為安定社會秩序一切建設之基本工作，本部警察總署所致力者為確立均權的警察制度。</p>
<p>洪氏復就戶政·禮俗·營建·方域·禁政諸端有所報告。</p>
<p>最後洪氏復就內政部工作動數陳渠個人之意見。其結語稱：中央宜儘量减少各級地方政府所受法令之束縛，使能盡其用，而各級地方政府則應尊重中央之政令，使能表裏貫澈，推行盡利。</p>

<h3>中共軍中高級參謀　多出身蘇聯軍校　共區兵工廠多由蘇聯指導設立蘇飛機專家屠凱葉夫撰文揭露</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦九日電〕數月前逃來英國之蘇聯嗜氣推進式飛機專家屠凱葉夫中校，於今晨星期快報上撰文一篇，　露蘇聯加强共產革命，使中國陷於共產統治，俾能專心圖謀歐洲之陰險計劃。據稱：中國之崩潰局面，下述兩極錯誤，實有以致之，一為西方國家對蘇聯攫取外蒙古之冷漠態度，外蒙久已為蘇聯在亞洲之主要兵工廠，此亦成中國崩潰之首要原因。一一因馬歇爾致力促成中國聯合政府之際，美國認中共為眞正「實地改革之自由份子」，其目的在推翻現有之政府。屠氏繼揭露中共軍中高級參謀職位，均由中，韓，蒙籍蘇維埃軍官充任，渠等最近多曾在蘇聯軍中服務，並在蘇聯各軍事學院中卒業，中國境內之蘇維埃區域中，頃皆設有武器工廠，其中大部分皆在謀聯指導下設立而成。據謂：自日本披降後，中共曾自蘇軍手中獲得大量日本武器，並獲大批蘇聯製造之武器，唯其商標，均易為外國所製。屠氏認為一九四五年中蘇條約之締結，乃蔣總統一生最愚昧之大錯。蘇聯於條約中，同意供給蔣總統以軍火，唯從未有蘇聯軍火送交蔣氏。又稱：外蒙古為中共力量之幕後來源，外蒙乃蘇聯在亞洲之保壘與兵工廠，大批蘇聯陸空軍駐守於外蒙，一如駐於蘇聯境內之任何地帶。屠氏稱：在克里姆林統治世界之藍圖中，歐洲為第一任務，亞洲為第二任務。德國崩潰後，史達林卽確信，於數年之內，渠將為歐洲大陸之主人。但因義大利，法國，德國共產黨運動之失敗，狄托之慶節，美國力量在馬歇爾計劃下之重返歐洲，使蘇聯西向之進展，暫告停頓。莫斯科政治局認為，在歐洲之鬥爭，較預期者遠為艱困，而在第二任務末了之前，如全力謀歐洲鬥爭之終結，不屬危險之舉。因此政治局決定轉移注意力，而成為亞洲第一。屠氏繼警告曰：如西方國家不能於東方制止史達林，則西方不可避免之攤牌，必將卽見來臨，其各種條件，對史達林亦日見有利。</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統向國會提出　承平時期龐大預算總額逾四百億軍費佔三之一　繼續經濟復興未包括在內</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕杜魯門總統今日向國會提出承平時代最龐大之預算，共達四百十八億五千八百萬元，其中半數用於進行對蘇冷戰，武裝西歐之經費尙不在內，年內將另案提出。新預算包括今年七月一日關始之十二個月費用，總額較一九四九年度增加十六億七千八百萬元，一九四九年度預算亦開平時紀錄。總統咨文中稱，武裝西歐之費用卽使不算在內，一九五〇年美國預算將虧蝕八億七千三百萬元，較一九四九年虧蝕之六億元為高，除非加稅挹注。今後之預算尙須擴大，以適應美國對全世界日益重大之責任及償大擴張之國防軍事設備·一九五〇年預算受國際與國防計劃支配，其情彩與職後歷屆預算相同，援外與國防兩項共達二百十億元。總統之新預算重心，包括：（一）國際事務與援外費用六十七億元，較一九四九年减少五億元。馬歇鐵計劃項下將減少一億元。對華之特別援助將自三億八千萬元减至四千九百萬元，但中國與韓國·希臘·土耳其分潤三億五千五百萬元之援助計劃、（二）國防費用約近一百四十三億元，佔全部預算三分之一，較一九四九年度增加二十五億地獄。其中配備軍隊尤其是空軍事研究·工業動員之經費蠶卅一億元，積儲軍略原料費五億三千萬元，普遍軍事訓練費用六億元、總統咨文中續稱，美國務須繼續以全力促成世界之和平與國內繁榮。美國過去對西歐之援助及各該國之互助，已在經濟復興與政治安定方面大獲進步、美國今日爲全世界自由之有力屏藩，美國爲維持本身實力計，必須準備有素，本預算中所提建軍計劃，乃承平時代最大之兵力。援外費用大部份用於復興西歐自由國家之經濟，西歐之復興乃世界其他各地保持獨立與自由之關鍵。吾人對歐洲復興之投資，必可在和平方面獲得多倍報酬。但在目前環境下，經濟力量不足以使自由人民獲得確切保陣，美國爰依照聯合國憲章，與西歐若干國家討論增進北大西洋區域安全之揹施。關於軍事援助西歐費用及對美國安全有重大關係若干國家之援助費用，一時尙難估計，當於日後另行提出之。要之，預算尙須擴大以慼付本計劃之需要，由此更足設明今後數年內國庫收入必須增加。今後美國之主要對外救濟活動，以救濟佔領區之德日為主。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦九日電〕海軍部今日宣布，英國現集中軍艦於中東，作為强硬抗議以色列軍擊落英機事之後盾。在地中海巡弋之航空母艦「凱旋」號與巡艦「福伯」號，已奉令調回馬爾太島，與其他軍艦會合，英艦兩艘並已啟椗開往塞浦魯斯島。陸戰隊一營亦在馬爾太候命待發，該島英海軍全體士兵今夜起不准請假登岸</p>
<p>〔法新開維電〕據此間觀察家認為如以色列對英方抗議不能予以滿意答覆則英方第一步措施，將為對以色列沿海實施封鎖。觀察家又指出巴勒斯坦事件將愈趨而愈成為西方與蘇聯問之尖銳衝突，因據渠等之意見，以色列曾獲得東歐國家之軍火接濟，同時蘇彝士區之英軍總部業已成為戰時體制。</p>

<h3>英猶雙方摩擦　英暫取旁觀</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕美國至少在目前對英猶閒之衝突，採取不千涉政策。國務部發言人稱，美國對英機五架被以色列擊落事，並無有所表示，蓋美國並未直接地捲入此事。但恐懼大規模戰爭，可能使中東淪入蘇聯手中，可能被迫使美官員對此一糾紛有所表示。卽使美國欲表示，亦將經由聯合國宣佈。</p>

<p>〔聯合社新德里九日電〕印度總理尼赫魯今日在國大黨常務委會宣稱，本月二十日在此舉行之亞洲各國會議，主要目的將證明各國對於印尼之切實同情。各國咸對荷蘭在印尼之行動深為　慨，外傳渠擬建立亞洲國家第三集團，以與其他兩集團相抗之說，決非事實。印度政府已向二十個國家發出請東，其中大多數可望應邀參加。截至目前為止，埃及，伊朗，澳洲，緬甸，錫蘭及阿富汗等國已提出覆文，接受邀請，巴基斯坦與菲律賓覆文亦在途中。</p>

<h3>原子鐘計準確　美科學家之新發明</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓九日電〕美國度量衡局頃已採用以原子衡量時間的革命性新方法。據稱，其準確程度，較諸以星體衡量時間尤為可靠。此項原子鐘係於星期四舉行之儀式中加以揭幕者。原子鐘係利用　分子內部區十雙動之自然周波數。由於原子活動不變之故，新時計與氣候。壓力·以及新舊無關。此種原子鐘較已往之任何一種時計為準確，而可使人類不必依賴依照地球自轉以衡量時間之舊方法。原子鐘之機件中，包括一內裝　氣高達卅呎之銅管，裝置於兩小間中。氬之原子震動由敏感之無綫電測量加以「觀察」，用以控制一振搖機，最後推動時針。發明比項原理者，為美國度量衡局測微組主任呂昻博士。</p>
<h3>十一年一循環　太陽黑點减少</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕海軍部天文台長克拉克稱，太陽黑點十一年一循環之嚴高峯已成過去，今後數年內黑點數目料將減少。最多一次係在一九四六年二月，當時電報與無綫電曾受强烈擾亂。氣象學家對太陽黑點影響地面氣滬問題，主張尙不一致，一部份認為在黑點增加期閒，紫外光綫隨之增加，足以改變地面大氣壓力，因而引起氣候變化。</p>
<h3>聖地爭案調人　彭契直羅德島</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約九日電〕聯合國調解員彭契及聯合國監視員主任里萊，今日下午同乘飛機赴羅德島，擬在該地領零埃猶休戰談判。瀕行前曾告新聞訪負，謂未來之談判可望安定大局而成立休戰，此一休戰將開啟和解之途徑而獲致政治問題如勘界等之解決·彭契對於英猶間最近所發生之不幸事件，在未接聖地監視員之報告以前，拒不發表任何意見，僅謂渠希望此事不於羅德島所將舉行之討論發生反饗。惟渠指出自停戰令發表後，任何方連英國在內，不應再有軍事活動。</p>
<h3>裕仁謁麥率　談話內容未透露</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十日電〕日皇裕仁今晨晋謁麥帥，作兩小時之會談，此為日投降後裕仁第七次之拜訪，談話內容並無公報發表。惟美日雙方人士認為在此次會談中，裕仁可能為中國事件之發展，與麥帥檢討日本及遠東局勢，因裕仁曾一度表示對於日警力薄弱，不足應付可能發生之禍亂表示關切。此間若干方面相信裕仁今晨之會商，可能涉及日本現芷面臨之共黨勢力日在增强中之一項問題。無論如何，甚至在目前冷戰之時，日本在抵抗共產主義所佔之地位，自　之觀點言，自仍居重要也。</p>

<h3>公用電話超額收費　可向公司檢舉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市公用事業漲價後，電話公司規定公用電話每次三元，然事實上市區各商店設有公用電話者，收費每次普遍均為五元，超過規定價格幾達一倍。至向私用電話各戶借打者，每次收價有高達十五元者。據電話公司營業部息：各處公用電話，照公司規章，不能超額收費。各界如列舉證據向公司檢舉，公司當設法取統。據悉：對裝設公用電話之各商店，電話公司並無津貼，故各商店之超額收費，顯係變相之目行收取津貼。</p>

<p>大同</p>
<p>校長胡敦復報告稱：該校太學期亦分為三期，每期學雜費卅三三元點三三，按生活指數計算，首期定十四日正式上課，每期學費分別結算，保有機動性，以便視情形分段結束。</p>

<p>方沛霖從影已有數十年歷史，以佈景設計馳名影壇，近年來由名佈景師轉任導演，作品多富美術氣息，為我國電影界唯一傑出之美術導演，因渠人綠極好，故在影壇中有「阿方哥」之稱。昨追悼會中其幼弟　亭，遺孤紹元，寬元，幸元，民元均掩淚參加。因方身後蕭條，電影界已推出四十七人合組治喪會，昨並決定辦法四項，為其籌劃子女敎育基金：（一）本月十五日下午一時起，由全體電影演員在天蟾舞台演出平劇。（二）本月廿日左右舉行一大規模歌唱會，由黎錦光，李君襄，黃貽鈞，陳歌辛會同電影界白光，白虹，周璇，襲秋霞，陳娟娟，張帆六人主持進仃·（三）勝利後方之作品八部，定期同時在太市八家戲院公映。（四）排演紀念性之話劇，由影劇界人士演出。此外方之子女五人，聞已由國强中學錢旭滄應允，供其在該校免費讀至初中畢業為止。</p>

<h3>南北市米價又激漲　到貸雖有一萬餘石　喊價仍加高四五成</h3>
<p>食米價格，昨日再度猛騰，因受無錫等產地漲風之波及，人心激盪，一致看高。開市喊價猛加五成，價格甚為混亂，正式做開約加四成。白粳最高喊一千五百五十元，後以一千四百五十成交。薄稻做價高達一千五百元，白元以一千八百元之高價成交，各漲約四百元。收市因價格過高，進戶觀望，貨主因銀根又緊，逢高脫手，價再下疲五十元。北市塲白粳，薄稻各開一千四百元，計漲四百元。昨日南市北市到貨共計一萬〇四百九十五石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>先漲後回，終見挺升。開市因米價之上漲，人心堅昂異常。老車及兵船開市均為五百六十元，後因銀根緊，貨主乘高售出，况業外物價漲後回跌，人心更虛，收市退進五百元內。老車粉收市四百九十五元，兵船以四百九十元收市，前者軋漲四十六元，後者挺五十元。紅蜂建成漲四十五至四十八元，雄牌粉均為先開，故上漲較多，收市無價。大包麩皮漲四十五元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>跟蹤米價狂漲，但後市轉降，結果軋漲仍多。黃豆開出甚少，乍豆未開，平湖豆先漲四百元，收市回低一百元。苞米初開狂加五百元，後卽告下降，終升三百餘元。紅糧亦狂漲五成。菉豆。元麥·揀靑一致騰升約四成左右。芝蔴漲五六百元，生仁猛挺八九百元，收市均見回降，而乏受主。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>猛漲狂落，上落幅度甚大，收市僅見略挺，初開因米價上漲，豆汕卽提升五六百元，最高時豆油叩五千元大關，後因銀根緊，業外價漲後回低，收市直瀉至四千三百元，較上週末略漲一百元。生菜汕一度至四千九百元，收市退至四千二百元，亦微升二百元。吉桶生汕初為五千元，收市退為四千七百元，計升二百元。豆餅先漲後跌，終軋升二三十元。長字餅收市三百六十元。</p>
<h3>銀要瀕午磚緊　現銷需求殷切</h3>
<p>市間銀根，昨日晨閒轉趨徵弛狀態，外埠匯款有到，頭寸供源轉旺，而國庫支出浩繁，業外週轉靈動，業內行莊單子頻鬆，外供亦多，市拆站四十元，合月息一元二角，最低廿五元，亦有供出。瀕午市塲銀根，以存兌價不動，黑市亦小，股票轉跌，各物收盤脚地呈軟，銀根走勢略緊。更以渝·滇，物價尙低，故資金有流出傾向，市拆升至月息一元八角至二元一角左右。</p>
<p>現鈔籌碼，昨日緊勢甚厲，業外需要，異常殷切，尤以航幫，力事搜求，五十元以上大票，貼水高達百分之八，較週六又見高增。</p>
<p>存款兌換金銀工作，各承辦行局昨日繼續進行。平衡費價格不動，計黃金每兩七千元，銀圓每元七十元，各行局所發申請書亦仍照舊，全市總額共一千二百張。各行門前之申請者，雖仍極踴躍，惟秩序較上週六顯已好轉。</p>
<p>財政部方面為明瞭木市各行局辦理存款兌換金銀之當際情况起見，昨日曾派遺大批稽核人員來滬，分赴各承辦行局巡視，並檢查一般帳册·</p>

<h3>寗波棉紗市塲　奉令暫行停止</h3>
<p>〔太報寗波十日電〕本埠棉紗市塲同業交易，頃因物價波動劇烈，為避免造成刺激物價因素，已奉令卽日起暫行停止。俟物價穩定後，重行開業。至塲外交易，當局亦將加緊取締。</p>
<h3>中信局出口結匯　去年三百萬美金</h3>
<p>中信局出口物資，去年度會竭力設法輸出換取大量外匯頭寸，據該局負責人稱：該局去年經辦之出口結匯，約計三百萬美金，此項數字全係扶持出口商而得者，代政府輸出之物資，尙不包括在內，出口物資中，以猪　桐汕最為多數，至木年度計劃，決加强是項業務，俾於平衡國際收支上有所裨益。</p>
<h3>桐油軋升</h3>
<p>桐汕昨市，開後卽因央行存兌黃金之牌價掛高，及圈外物價之倘升，故各方買氣雖仍式微，而人心極度昂挺，喊價繼續上揚，是以趨勢迭吐秀氣，價格方面，比上週軋升不少。</p>
<h3>棉紗市况盤旋　細布邁進疊見新高峰</h3>
<p>棉紗以市上暗息高昻，散戶不勝重息之負祖，了結甚衆，但大戶仍主樂觀，逢低尙有吸進，結果各紗呈盤旋局面。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳微小五〇〇元，以八二五〇〇元收市，三二支銀月最後做六二〇〇〇元，二一支雙馬現貨站住於五〇〇〇〇元上下，較假前略挫二〇〇〇元左右。</p>
<p>二〇支雙馬與金城天女等，俱在四六〇〇〇元成交，一六支天女終降五〇〇元，光明則仍站於四一〇〇〇元之原檔未動，奔騰僅低三〇〇元，以四〇七〇〇元結局，其他各紗均呈穩中帶軟之勢。</p>
<p>布市再露終鋩，塲內傳說仍屬利買，木客伸手甚繁，各布初開卽見新高，過程續向俏途邁進，近午舊多獲利有賣，以迄於收，大多仍回至開盤價結束。</p>
<p>龍頭細布以紡建久未開售，致市上籌碼頗緊，執有者認為奇貨可居，亂抬市價，故塲上交易無法展開，聞塲外喊二三五〇元尙乏人售出，喇叭童細布自二一三〇元步退至二〇六〇元，繼而復創」一二三〇元新高，午收為二二〇〇元，軋漲三九〇元。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰初開一九五〇元，最高達二一二〇元，收前曾喊小至一九一〇元，終為一九八〇元，較假前挺一五〇元。四君子元直貢終升二〇〇元，以二〇八〇元收市，一九〇高檔士林見四五〇〇元新高峯。</p>
<h3>絲綢平堅</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况先高後回，初因銀根有寬有緊，隔昨多頭板持，喊價未小，繼聞外匯移轉證市價回挫，業外紗布亦軟，人心轉低。一二〇號天橋早晨以九〇〇〇〇元開喊，喊後交易沉寂，走勢軟弱，浮多情虛急了，市勢略小，前市收盤八八五〇〇元了結，較上週六仍見軋升。後市趨勢　軟，人心閒數，各帮納胃慘淡，價再回小八〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>生絲外匯市價挫落，業外各物漲後均回，人心無以刺激，樂中銀根仍緊，絲織業納胃中飽，價級零担前市九二〇〇〇元收束，市勢轉入盤局，後市散戶了售不絕，各物普見疲軟，人心益虛，喊價續小二三千元。</p>
<p>細缎昨日先以高盤開做，中間買氣盛旺，市况扶遙直上，收市一致報漲。美亞被面晨開以四七〇〇〇元登塲後，業外游資湧入，買風激勵，喊價步升，高見五二〇〇〇元，嗣後　面逢高脫手，塲外物價報小，生絲人絲均回，脫意漸鬆，納胃頓减，市勢疲軟，前市五〇五〇〇元結束，後市一般物價大勢均疲，執戶仍多了售，喊價再小二三千元。</p>
<h3>投機集中活動　日用品狂漲</h3>
<p>日用品於客歲年終，市况極疲，由於時屆冬令，肥皂等日用品實銷銳减當時市面價格，與戰前黃金食糧等貨品之基價大致相仿。惟自新春以來，此項貨品為一般投機家所垂靑，在各方集中活動拉抬下，市價在升暴漲，挺秀之勢，頗足驚人。如按日前市塲報價，與黃金食米相較，所漲倍數，已越出一倍光景。據業內人士告稱，若干圈外客商鑒於前年冬季日用品趨勢，而有拋出紗布黃金，套購肥皂，進行投機之舉。昨日市塲漲風，雖經置續多日，尙為各方熱烈追逐之對象。固本漲起五成以上，市塲報價為二千二百五十元，實銷上此項價格，尙少斬售者。箭刀皂二千二百元，黃祥茂一千八百元，美麗火柴七千二百元，鳳鳳火柴七千元，南京四千二百元，寗波四千元</p>
<h3>茶市堅穩</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，執戶鑒於塲外各物之漲風，旣仍蔓延不息，加以公用事業陡增一倍半，而成木勢必加重，故態度益萌堅守，喊價一再猛晋，是以買戶雖仍趨前，卒因談判陷於相持，交易寥若晨星，過程則迭露鋒鋩，行情繼續躍升，脚地亦頗鞏固。</p>
<h3>小型工廠貸款　決定原則三項</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕央行貼放會於昨日上午十一時舉行第廿一次會議，出席劉攻芸徐寄廎李立俠趙棣華李叔明林崇墉等十餘人，由劉攻芸主席，除報告事項外，討論上週工礦貿易兩顧問委員會所審查通過之貸款案，共三十三件。計審定有關交通公用煤礦製監運鹽及酒精鋼鐵電化造紙等工業貸款案廿三件，鋁錠猪鬃桐油等出口物資貸款案三件，婉却七件。又本市小型工廠因缺乏原料及製成品質押，且以規模過小，難以商洽銀行承兌，故申請貸款幾不可能，此項因難，經各方向該會呼籲後，該會已於昨日提出作詳盡討論，並決定原則三項：（一）各類工業之小型工廠，仍繼續生產而週轉資金困難亟須申請貸款者，得由三家聯環担保，並由同業公會保證申請貸款。（二）各小型工廠申請貸款案，母須由行莊承轉，可將申請表送由各該業同業公會證明屬實後，轉請央行貼放會核辦。（三）央行貼放會組設小型工廠貸款審查委員會，聘請工業界人士參加，員責審查此類申請案件，經核准後，卽指定若千銀行辦理。</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Returns to Nanjing to Meet with the President, Declares Central and Local Views are Consistent, Meets with Cheng Qian in Changsha for Cordial Conversation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th] Zhang Qun, who flew to Wuhan on the 8th in response to Bai Chongxi's telegram invitation and met with Bai, flew to Changsha on the morning of the 10th to meet with Chairman Cheng Qian. At 5:15 PM, he returned to Nanjing on the Tze Chiang special plane and met with the President that evening to report on his trip. A reporter waited for him at the airport. Zhang appeared cheerful as he disembarked, seemingly signaling the successful completion of his mission. When asked if he had any new opinions after meeting with Bai and Cheng, Zhang replied in the negative, stating that the views of the local authorities and the central government were consistent. When asked about the situation of the Peace Promotion Association initiated by the Hubei Provincial Assembly, Zhang replied that he had met with members of the Hubei Provincial Assembly and learned that two provinces had responded. When asked if he thought the association could be successfully convened, Zhang said that it was their freedom. When asked if Bai Chongxi was expected to visit Nanjing in the near future, Zhang said that he would come if necessary. Finally, when asked if there had been further progress in the current peace negotiation process, which had entered the stage of inviting four countries to participate, Zhang said that he had only seen this in the newspapers.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Hankou, 10th] Zhang Qun, accompanied by his staff member Mr. Zhou Junliang, left Hankou at 9:00 AM on the 10th for Hunan to visit Cheng Qian. Bai Chongxi, Xu Zuyi, and local administrative heads such as Zhang Dulun, Zhang Zhen, and Xu Huizhi all went to the airport to see him off. Before his departure, Zhang told reporters that he was very pleased to revisit this old place. He said that what he wanted to say had been detailed in his written statement yesterday, and he had nothing further to add. He wished to telegraph a single word in response: that the nationwide desire for peace was completely unified, and that everyone should work together towards this goal in the future. Huang Shaohong and Liu Jianxu, who came from Hunan to Hankou to welcome Zhang, did not fly to Hunan; it is said that they will stay here for a short while. After seeing Zhang Qun off, Zhang Zhen visited Commander-in-Chief Bai again to ask for instructions, and then took a car to his post in Xinyang at around 11:00 AM. According to Zhang's conversation with our reporter at the station, Central China is calm, and all rumors should be thoroughly clarified after Mr. Yuejun (Zhang Qun) came to Hankou.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Changsha, 10th] Political Committee Member Zhang Qun arrived in Changsha at 10:30 AM on the 10th. After disembarking, he went to the Provincial Government to rest. He had a cordial conversation with Cheng Qian around a stove for an hour and summoned the heads of various agencies and leaders of public opinion organizations. At 2:00 PM, he flew back to Nanjing on the same plane. Before leaving, he met with reporters and said that only those who can fight can make peace. Regarding the rumors circulating from Wuhan, Zhang Zhengjun stated that they were completely untrue. Such rumors were as absurd as the report that the President had gone to Taiwan. He had met with Commander-in-Chief Bai on this trip, and Bai was in complete agreement with the central government's steps. He hoped that reporters would report more to Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing, Central News Agency, 10th] In recent days, some newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai have reported that General Cheng Qian, Director of the Changsha Pacification Headquarters, had entrusted Vice Minister of National Defense General Huang Jie to submit a letter to the President on the 7th of this month, making suggestions on the current situation. General Huang stated that the above rumors were completely untrue.</p>
<h3>Symposium of Legislators in Nanjing: Extensive Discussion on the Peace Issue</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 10th] Some legislators in Nanjing held a symposium at 3:30 PM on the 10th, attended by about 100 people. Wang Guangqing was elected chairman. Several legislators first emphasized that the speakers at the symposium could only express their personal opinions and could not make any resolutions. Then, they conducted an extensive discussion on the peace issue. Nineteen of the speakers were from the Northeast. Only one person openly opposed peace. The rest firmly stated that peace was in the interests of the people and the hope for the nation's destiny. The Legislative Yuan was composed of legislators representing voters, and their consideration of peace was only on what methods and efforts to use to strive for it. One legislator stated that if it was necessary for peace, he was willing to give up his identity as a legislator under the current legal system. Another legislator said that in the government's efforts to strive for peace, it must also work to improve itself. Political democratization, economic socialization, and nationalization of the military are all necessary, and foreign policy must also be re-examined. The speaking legislators expressed great hope for peace and believed that whether the hope could become a reality depended on the degree of effort of those who were loyal to the country and loved the people. Finally, one legislator proposed holding an enlarged symposium within the week to discuss whether it was necessary to convene a temporary meeting to formally express views on the peace issue, but no conclusion was reached, and the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>

He emphasized that whether to fight or make peace depends on the will of the military. The reason why the Northern Expedition was successful was because the participants were of one mind and shared life and death. With this spirit, they could advance to fight or retreat to make peace. If they were living in a drunken dream, not to mention peace, even kneeling before the enemy would be liquidated. Zhu believed that Deng, Yang, Wang, and other Sichuan veterans leading the military and political affairs of Southwest China could make the Land of Abundance a fortress of victory. Deng said in his speech that he was willing to strive for peace to alleviate the suffering of the people of Sichuan.</p>

<h3>Truman Did Not Propose New US Aid to China, State Department Denies Obstructing Aid to China Plan</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Washington, United Press, 11th] President Truman avoided mentioning the issue of new US aid to China in his budget message on the 11th. Truman postponed this whole issue to "later," which seems to coincide with the rumors that he is waiting to see what happens to the Chinese government. The State Department denied that there was any plan to "shelve" aid to China. Another spokesman emphasized that the two aid to China plans approved by the Eightieth Congress are "daily" in progress. The two aid plans are 125 million US dollars in military aid and 275 million US dollars in economic aid. Most of them have already been used. The question that has not been answered now is what will happen after these two funds are used up. President Truman did not reveal this issue in his message. After making a special request for aid to Western Europe, he said that the scope and amount of other aid plans cannot be accurately predicted at present. The plan currently includes the four countries of Greece, Turkey, China, and South Korea. It is generally believed that the wording "currently includes" used by Truman is a chance to take a step back. An official said that Greece and Turkey can get new US aid as soon as the plan is drafted, but he refused to speculate on the plans for the other two countries.</p>
<h3>Bao Erhan Formally Assumes Office Announces Ten Political Propositions for Governing Xinjiang, Establishing Peace, and Enhancing Friendship The Issue of Ghulja Is Still Facing Technical Difficulties</h3>

He pointed out that under the current circumstances, anyone who opposes Sino-Soviet friendship, national unity, democratic politics, or ethnic solidarity is undermining peace and will be regarded as reactionary and will not be tolerated. Finally, he put forward ten political propositions: (1) To establish permanent peace in the province of Xinjiang, (2) To enhance Sino-Soviet friendship, (3) To ensure that all ethnic groups in the province love each other sincerely and strengthen unity, (4) To eradicate corruption and implement clean governance, (5) To build up the agricultural and pastoral economy of the province and improve the people's lives, (6) To develop culture and education, (7) To build a prosperous and happy new Xinjiang, (8) Long live the unity of all ethnic groups in the province, (9) Long live the bright future of all the people of Xinjiang, (10) Long live the great Republic of China.</p>

Regarding the Ghulja issue, which concerns the people of the seven districts, he did not deny that there would be some technical difficulties in the future resolution process, but its development is surely optimistic. Bao also stated, "I am confident that under the direction of Director Zhang, I am 80% confident that I can smoothly resolve the troubling issues." When the reporter inquired about his specific solutions, he replied, "To seek permanent cooperation in the future, the Ghulja side must comply with the peace terms and governance program, and eliminate special phenomena. If the people of Ghulja still lack a cooperative attitude, even if they temporarily cooperate, it will inevitably lead to another split, which I do not wish to see happen."</p>

<h3>Saving the Lives of the Next Generation</h3>
<p>The weather has been severely cold recently, and dozens, or even more than a hundred, frozen corpses are found on the streets of Shanghai every day. This is such a heartbreaking and tragic event. According to statistics from various newspapers on the 10th, the number of frozen corpses collected by various charitable organizations, based on the figures for the 9th alone, is as follows: Pushen Villa collected 93 children's corpses and 5 adult corpses; Nan Shi Tongren Zhuanyuan Hall collected 34 children's corpses and 2 adult corpses; and the Central District Wenren Fuyuan Branch Hall collected 10 children's corpses and 1 adult corpse. According to Pushen Villa staff, it is very common to collect fifty or sixty children's corpses and four or five adult corpses from the streets every day. According to Tongren Fuyuan Hall staff, the hall has collected more than 300 corpses in recent days, with as many as 55 children's corpses on the busiest day. These statistics illustrate two points: first, more than 100 frozen corpses are found and collected on the streets of Shanghai every day, and the majority are children's corpses; second, as the weather turns colder, the number of frozen corpses is increasing daily, and the increase in mortality is mainly due to the abandonment of children and infants.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is a serious social problem that illustrates the tragedy of the human world and the fate of orphans in troubled times, leading to death. Facing this situation, if the government authorities and philanthropists do not urgently rescue this group of dying orphans, and do not thoroughly implement social relief, the painful tragedy will not stop because of the warming weather. The misery of the human world will inevitably continue to occur and deepen.</p>
<p>How do we know how this social problem arises? According to sociology and social phenomena, this social problem currently exists for at least two reasons: first, because of poverty, and second, because of war. Regarding the relationship between the two, the expansion of urban poverty and death is entirely based on war. From a social historical perspective, poverty is the cause of war, or rather, war is the result of poverty. If there is no poverty in society, there will be no war; after a war occurs, it will invariably affect poverty in society. From the perspective of war development, in a war-torn society, whether on the front lines or in the rear, the value of life is like grass; the lives of men, women, old, and young are readily thrown onto barbed wire, rubble ruins, streets, and roadsides. Therefore, war not only destroys construction and obliterates the lives of our contemporaries but also buries the lives of our next generation! Recently, there was a film in Shanghai called "Orphans in Troubled Times," reflecting the fate of a group of orphans in war. They suffer the most brutal persecution, are separated from their parents and families, and are constantly humiliated and harmed, eroding their childhood. They are gloomy, dim, fearful, and suspicious. Finally, they lose their lives. Clearly, this is a depiction of the tragedy of the next generation of humanity. After the President's New Year's Day message, the Shanghai Municipal Council called for a ceasefire between the two sides. In their appeal telegram, they said, "In the past two or three years, countless people have been killed, and our compatriots are suffering deeply. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have siblings? Who doesn't have spouses? Who doesn't have children? The strong are scattered in all directions, the old are wandering in ditches, and the human hell is heartbreaking." This fully illustrates that social poverty and human separation are entirely based on war, entirely rooted in war.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to urgently rescue this group of dying orphans in society and to thoroughly implement social relief, we must first demand peace within the country. Only with domestic peace can there be social peace. Secondly, in an environment of peaceful construction, we need to establish a social relief system to thoroughly implement social conservation and health care, not only to preserve the lives of our contemporaries but also to conserve the lives of the next generation. As for the large number of children's corpses abandoned on the streets of Shanghai, most are abandoned infants from poor families, and a very small portion are children who died in hospitals and were not collected. This is entirely a phenomenon caused by social poverty. Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Government is actively promoting winter relief, and the purpose of winter relief is to relieve poverty and help poor families get through the cold winter. Therefore, we hope that the Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee and charitable organizations will face this serious social problem squarely and quickly find ways to rescue this group of dying orphans under the dual beliefs of compassion and love! In short, the lives of the next generation are as precious as the lives of our contemporaries. Our responsibility today is not only to preserve the lives of our contemporaries and demand the realization of domestic peace and social peace, but also to preserve the lives of our future generations, making their childhood and souls especially strong, and not allowing the cold currents of Siberia to kill them!</p>
<h3>At the Kuomintang Memorial Week Interior Minister Hong Lanyou Delivers His First Policy Report Briefly Elaborating on Eight Aspects Such as Governance</h3>

At the same time, we hope that the country's entire personnel system can be effectively established, that the advancement of staff members is based entirely on examination, that promotions and demotions are based entirely on performance, and that salaries and grades are reasonable.</p>
<p>Regarding local autonomy, Hong stated that to promote local autonomy, it is necessary to improve grassroots organizations first. In the future, we should strive to strengthen the grassroots organizations, and supervise and implement them in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "Local Autonomy Begins Implementation Law," taking into account local conditions. Regarding police administration, Hong said that police administration is the basic work for stabilizing social order and all construction. The police department of the Ministry of Interior is committed to establishing a police system of balanced power.</p>
<p>Hong also reported on household administration, customs, construction, territory, and prohibition.</p>

<h3>Senior Staff Officers of the Chinese Communist Army Mostly Graduated from Soviet Military Academies Soviet Aircraft Expert Tukayev Reveals That Many of the Communist Areas' Ordnance Factories Were Established Under Soviet Guidance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 9th] Lieutenant Colonel Tukayev, a Soviet turbojet aircraft expert who fled to Britain a few months ago, wrote an article in this morning's Sunday Express, revealing that the Soviet Union is strengthening the communist revolution, plunging China into communist rule, in order to concentrate on its sinister plans for Europe. It is said that the collapse of China was due to the following two extreme mistakes: first, the Western countries' indifferent attitude towards the Soviet Union's seizure of Outer Mongolia, which has long been the Soviet Union's main ordnance factory in Asia. This is also the main reason for China's collapse. Second, when Marshall was working to promote the formation of a Chinese coalition government, the United States recognized the Chinese Communists as true "freedom fighters for on-the-spot reform," whose purpose was to overthrow the existing government. Tukayev continued to reveal that the senior staff positions in the Chinese Communist army are filled by Soviet officers of Chinese, Korean, and Mongolian descent. Most of them have recently served in the Soviet army and graduated from various Soviet military academies. In the Soviet areas in China, weapon factories have recently been established, most of which were established under Soviet guidance. It is said that after Japan surrendered, the Chinese Communists obtained a large number of Japanese weapons from the Soviet army, as well as a large number of Soviet-made weapons, but their trademarks were changed to those made in foreign countries. Tukayev believes that the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty in 1945 was the most foolish mistake of President Chiang's life. In the treaty, the Soviet Union agreed to supply President Chiang with military supplies, but no Soviet military supplies were ever delivered to Chiang. It is also said that Outer Mongolia is the backstage source of the Chinese Communist power. Outer Mongolia is the Soviet Union's fortress and ordnance factory in Asia. A large number of Soviet land and air forces are stationed in Outer Mongolia, just like in any area within the Soviet Union. Tukayev said that in the Kremlin's blueprint for ruling the world, Europe is the first task and Asia is the second task. After the collapse of Germany, Stalin was convinced that within a few years, he would be the master of the European continent. However, due to the failure of the communist movements in Italy, France, and Germany, Tito's betrayal, and the return of American power to Europe under the Marshall Plan, the Soviet Union's westward advance was temporarily halted. The Moscow Politburo believes that the struggle in Europe is far more difficult than expected, and it is not dangerous to fully seek the end of the struggle in Europe before the end of the second task. Therefore, the Politburo decided to shift its attention and become the first in Asia. Tukayev continued to warn: If the Western countries cannot stop Stalin in the East, then the inevitable showdown in the West will soon arrive, and various conditions will become increasingly favorable to Stalin.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance is Conducting a Thorough Investigation into the Central Bank's Staff's Gold Exchange</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Regarding the Central Bank staff's non-normal procedures for depositing and exchanging gold and silver, in addition to dispatching personnel to conduct a thorough investigation, the Ministry of Finance has also ordered the Central Bank to quickly report the amount of deposits and exchanges of staff members to the Ministry.

However, a certain branch of the Central Bank still handled deposits and exchanges for colleagues after the 6th, and the date on the application was filled in as the 5th.

<h3>President Truman Presents a Huge Peacetime Budget to Congress - Total Exceeds 40 Billion, Military Spending Accounts for One-Third - Continued Economic Recovery Not Included</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington dispatch, 9th] President Truman today submitted to Congress the largest peacetime budget, totaling 41.858 billion dollars, half of which will be used to conduct the Cold War against the Soviet Union, and the cost of arming Western Europe is not included, which will be submitted separately later this year. The new budget includes the expenses for the twelve months starting on July 1 this year, and the total amount increased by 1.678 billion dollars compared with fiscal year 1949. The budget for fiscal year 1949 also set a peacetime record. The President stated in his message that even without counting the cost of arming Western Europe, the US budget for 1950 will have a deficit of 873 million dollars, higher than the deficit of 600 million dollars in 1949, unless taxes are increased to fill the gap. Future budgets will need to be expanded to accommodate the increasingly important responsibilities of the United States to the world and to compensate for the greatly expanded national defense military equipment. The 1950 budget is dominated by international and national defense programs, and its nature is the same as the budgets of previous post-war years. Foreign aid and national defense together account for 21 billion dollars. The focus of the President's new budget includes: (1) International affairs and foreign aid expenses of 6.7 billion dollars, a decrease of 500 million dollars compared with 1949. The amount under the Marshall Plan will be reduced by 100 million dollars. Special aid to China will be reduced from 380 million dollars to 49 million dollars, but the aid plan of 355 million dollars will be shared by China, South Korea, Greece, and Turkey. (2) National defense expenses of nearly 14.3 billion dollars, accounting for one-third of the total budget, an increase of 2.5 billion dollars compared with 1949. Among them, the funds for equipping the army, especially the air force's research and industrial mobilization, are 3.1 billion dollars, the cost of stockpiling strategic military raw materials is 530 million dollars, and the cost of universal military training is 600 million dollars. The President continued in his message that the United States must continue to promote world peace and domestic prosperity with all its strength. The past US assistance to Western Europe and the mutual assistance of various countries have made great progress in economic recovery and political stability. The United States today is a powerful barrier to freedom in the world. In order to maintain its own strength, the United States must be well prepared. The military building plan proposed in this budget is the largest military force in peacetime. Most of the foreign aid expenses are used to revive the economies of free countries in Western Europe. The revival of Western Europe is the key to maintaining independence and freedom in other parts of the world. Our investment in the recovery of Europe will surely reap multiple rewards in terms of peace. However, in the current environment, economic power is not enough to provide a solid guarantee for free people. The United States, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, is discussing with some Western European countries the security measures to enhance the North Atlantic region. The cost of military assistance to Western Europe and assistance to some countries that have a significant relationship with US security are difficult to estimate for the time being, and will be submitted separately in the future. In short, the budget needs to be expanded to meet the needs of this plan, which further shows that national treasury revenue must be increased in the next few years. The main foreign relief activities of the United States in the future will be to relieve the occupied areas of Germany and Japan.</p>
<h3>Military and Political Authorities Discuss Middle East Situation - British Fleet Concentrates and Waits for Orders - Will Blockade the Israeli Coast If Necessary</h3>
<p>[Our report] New York 10th broadcast: Israel is preparing to file a formal complaint against Britain to the Security Council. At the same time, it is rumored that Britain is also preparing to file a counter-complaint against the new Jewish state.</p>
<p>[United Press London dispatch, 10th] As a powerful British fleet concentrates at a location only 48 hours away from Tel Aviv, Britain is considering sending naval, land, and air reinforcements to the eastern Mediterranean on the 10th. British Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin discussed the British-Israeli crisis caused by Israel's downing of five British aircraft. Afterwards, an emergency meeting of the Cabinet Defense Committee was convened at No. 10 Downing Street. In addition to the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force and the Chiefs of Staff of the three services attended.</p>
<p>A Navy Department spokesman said, when talking about naval operations in the Mediterranean, that the commander-in-chief in the area has the right to assemble ships, and reinforcements are in the hands of the higher authorities. Although Israel refuses to accept British protests, the British Foreign Office does not seem to mind.</p>
<p>[United Press London dispatch, 9th] The Navy Department announced today that Britain is now concentrating warships in the Middle East as a backing for a strong protest against the Israeli military's downing of British aircraft. The aircraft carrier "Triumph" and the cruiser "Frobisher," which were patrolling the Mediterranean, have been ordered to return to Malta to join other warships. Two British ships have already set sail for Cyprus. A marine battalion is also waiting for orders in Malta. All British naval soldiers on the island are not allowed to leave the island tonight.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Cairo dispatch] Observers here believe that if Israel fails to give a satisfactory reply to Britain's protest, Britain's first step will be to impose a blockade on the Israeli coast.

A State Department spokesman said that the United States has not expressed any opinion on the downing of five British aircraft by Israel, because the United States is not directly involved in the matter. However, the fear of a large-scale war, which may cause the Middle East to fall into the hands of the Soviet Union, may force US officials to express an opinion on this dispute. Even if the United States wants to express an opinion, it will be announced through the United Nations.</p>

<h3>US Senate to Propose Factory Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Guaranteeing Permanent Full Employment</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 9th United Press] The US Senate will propose a revolutionary factory construction plan tomorrow to guarantee a permanent "full employment" plan, initiated by Senators Sparkman and Murray, and known as the Full Employment Act of 1950. When President Truman presented the State of the Union address to Congress last week, he said that government loans should be used to expand production equipment. The current "Full Employment Act of 1950" will stipulate that the federal government raises funds to be used by various states, cities, and federal agencies for factory construction, and private enterprises can also apply for government loans to expand internal or add new equipment.</p>
<h3>Atomic Clock Counts Accurately - New Invention by US Scientists</h3>
<p>[US News Service Washington dispatch, 9th] The US Bureau of Standards has recently adopted a revolutionary new method of measuring time with atoms. It is said that its accuracy is more reliable than measuring time with celestial bodies. This atomic clock was unveiled at a ceremony held on Thursday. The atomic clock uses the natural frequency of the vibrations inside the cesium molecule. Because atomic activity is constant, the new clock is irrelevant to climate, pressure, and old or new. This atomic clock is more accurate than any previous clock, and can free human beings from relying on the old method of measuring time according to the earth's rotation. The components of the atomic clock include a copper tube filled with cesium gas up to 30 feet, installed in two small rooms. The atomic vibration of argon is "observed" by sensitive wireless measurement, which is used to control an oscillator, and finally drives the hands. The inventor of this principle is Dr. Lyon, director of the Microscopic Measurement Group of the US Bureau of Standards.</p>
<h3>Eleven-Year Cycle - Sunspots Decrease</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington dispatch, 9th] Naval Observatory Director Clark said that the peak of the sunspot's eleven-year cycle has passed, and the number of sunspots is expected to decrease in the next few years. The most was in February 1946, when telegrams and wireless radio were strongly disturbed. Meteorologists have different views on the impact of sunspots on ground-based meteorological phenomena. Some believe that during the period of increased sunspots, ultraviolet rays increase accordingly, which is enough to change the ground atmospheric pressure, thus causing climate change.</p>
<h3>Holy Land Dispute Mediator - Bunche to Rhode Island</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse New York dispatch, 9th] UN mediator Bunche and UN Supervisory Officer Riley took a plane to Rhode Island this afternoon to lead the Rhodes Island-Israel armistice negotiations. Before leaving, they told news reporters that the future negotiations are expected to stabilize the overall situation and establish an armistice. This armistice will open the way for reconciliation and lead to the resolution of political issues such as boundary demarcation. Bunche refused to express any opinion on the recent unfortunate events between Britain and Israel until he received the report from the Holy Land Supervisor. He only said that he hoped that this matter would not affect the discussions to be held in Rhode Island. However, he pointed out that since the ceasefire order was issued, no party, including Britain, should engage in military activities.</p>
<h3>Hirohito Meets MacArthur - Content of Talks Not Disclosed</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tokyo dispatch, 10th] Emperor Hirohito of Japan paid a visit to MacArthur this morning for a two-hour meeting. This is Hirohito's seventh visit since Japan surrendered. No communiqué was issued on the content of the talks. However, US and Japanese sources believe that during this meeting, Hirohito may have reviewed the situation in Japan and the Far East with MacArthur due to the development of the Chinese situation, because Hirohito once expressed concern about the weakness of the Japanese police force, which is not enough to cope with possible riots. Some sources here believe that Hirohito's consultations this morning may involve the issue of the communist forces currently facing Japan, which are increasing day by day. In any case, even in the current Cold War, Japan's position in resisting communism is still important from the perspective of the United States.</p>

<h3>Public Utilities Automatically Adjust Prices - Public Works Bureau Chief Says It is Impossible to Accept</h3>
<p>[Our report] The city's major public utility companies, affected by price increases and sharply increased costs, recently submitted a request to the Public Works Bureau, requesting permission to automatically adjust prices as needed. According to Director Zhao, the companies' losses are indeed a fact, and the above request is reasonable, but in order to take care of the lives of citizens, the municipal government can hardly accept the request. However, it can be adopted as a reference when considering new methods.</p>
<h3>Overcharging on Public Telephones - Can Report to the Company</h3>
<p>[Our report] After the price increase of public utilities in the city, the telephone company stipulates that public telephones cost three yuan each time. However, in fact, stores with public telephones in the urban area generally charge five yuan each time, exceeding the prescribed price by almost double. As for those who borrow private telephones from various households, the price charged each time is as high as fifteen yuan. According to the business department of the telephone company, public telephones in various places cannot be overcharged according to the company's regulations. If all sectors provide evidence to report to the company, the company will try to take unified measures. It is learned that the telephone company does not subsidize the stores that install public telephones, so the overcharging by the stores is obviously a disguised way of collecting subsidies themselves.</p>

(2) As for student rice, the Civil Affairs Association has not yet finished issuing the rice ration for December, and requested to reissue it. It is hoped that the monthly rice ration for each school will be issued to each school within the first five days of the current month in the future, and the ration price is also expected to be announced as soon as possible so that self-funded students can pay according to the fee. (3) The treatment of professors is now adjusted to be issued at 15 times. The Ministry of Education previously remitted six months at a time according to the November standard, but it is only equivalent to twice the new standard for January. It is requested that this amount be issued at one time. (4) Student public funds, school fees, and living allowances for faculty and staff are requested to be issued at three months at a time as an emergency fund. (5) Since the opening of price limits, public utilities expenses such as water, electricity, gas, and telephone have soared. It now costs about one million yuan per school per month, but the regular expenses allocated by the Ministry of Education are only ten thousand yuan, which is only 1%. It is requested to increase the regular expenses in the future, otherwise, please the government directly pay for the public utility expenses of each school. Undersecretary Tian said that he will do his best to seek solutions to the economic difficulties of various schools. The Ministry of Education has now negotiated with the Central Bank to increase the overdraft amount for each school.

<h3>Shanghai's Salivan on Nanjing Road: Closed Due to Annual Bonus Dispute</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Salivan Confectionery Company on Nanjing Road recently announced a sudden closure yesterday due to the unresolved annual bonus issue between labor and management.

<h3>Air Transport of Food to Tianjin and Beijing: Many Technical Difficulties Remain. US-Aided 9,000 Tons of Wheat Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>It is reported that the government, in view of the interrupted sea routes between Shanghai and Tianjin and Beijing, intends in principle to supply food to Tianjin and Beijing by air transport. However, there are many technical difficulties with this matter, and the high cost of freight is one of them. Therefore, a final decision has not yet been made. It is heard that the price of flour in Tianjin and Beijing is 1,200 yuan per bag, but the freight cost per bag is 2,500 yuan. To date, there are still more than 30,000 bags of flour, a shortfall from October, remaining in Shanghai for transshipment to Tianjin and Beijing. Only a portion of the flour supplied by the US Economic Cooperation Administration from November onwards has been transported. In addition, all food rations for Qingdao will be supplied by us from January onwards.</p>

<h3>Hankou Airport Under Repair: Air Mail Re-routed by Train</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to news from the Municipal Post Office, Hankou Airport has been under repair since December 22 of last year.

The Hankou Airport runway is expected to be repaired in about four weeks. Once Civil Aviation flights resume, airmail from Shanghai will return to normal.</p>
<h3>Presidents of Private Colleges and Universities Discuss Tuition Standards: Based on Rice or Index, Final Decision Pending</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The presidents of private colleges and universities in this city held a symposium at the Tsinghua Alumni Association yesterday afternoon, attended by more than 20 people. The meeting discussed the issue of tuition standards for the next semester. It was generally believed that calculating the next semester's fees based on the upper semester's standards multiplied by the cost of living index would be too different from calculating them based on rice as the standard, which would affect the livelihood of faculty and staff. Therefore, it is still planned to use three and a half to four and a half dan of rice as the standard, and the principle of collecting fees in one lump sum. Because most schools need to start school by mid-February, there is still a month to go, and there will be many changes in the situation and rice prices. Therefore, it was decided to hold another meeting on February 7 to discuss and make a final decision.</p>
<p>St. John's</p>
<p>Acting President Zhao Xiuhong reported at the meeting that the school had already started classes yesterday. The semester is divided into three terms. The first term ends on February 19. The tuition and miscellaneous fees for each term are calculated by multiplying the base amount of 32 yuan by the cost of living index. The first term is calculated at 18.3 times the index at the end of December, totaling 585 yuan. There are more than a thousand students in the entire school. Because the fee amount is not high, there are no longer as many cases of late payment or requests for free tuition as in the last semester.</p>
<p>Datong</p>
<p>Principal Hu Dunfu reported that the school's term is also divided into three terms, with tuition and miscellaneous fees of 33.33 yuan per term calculated according to the cost of living index. The first term is scheduled to officially start on the 14th. The tuition fees for each term are settled separately to maintain flexibility in order to end in stages depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Shanghai College</p>
<p>Secretary-General Sun Ruilin reported that the school is scheduled to start school on the 12th and classes on the 17th. It has not yet been decided whether the standard for tuition and miscellaneous fees will be calculated according to the cost of living index or rice. If calculated according to the index, the livelihood of faculty and staff cannot be maintained. Therefore, it is considering using four or four and a half dan of rice as the standard, which is pending final decision. Many parents of students have requested to pay in installments, but the school plans to collect the full amount in one lump sum in principle.</p>
<p>Soochow</p>
<p>President Yang Yongqing reported that the school's law school will start school on the 21st. Tuition and miscellaneous fees may also be paid in two installments, and the standard is being considered based on the cost of living index.</p>
<h3>Seven Representatives Appointed to Inquire About Scholarships</h3>
<p>For the matter of scholarships for poor students, the principals appointed Ou Yuanhuai, Wang Yukai, Zhao Xiuhong, Hu Dunfu, Yang Yongqing, Li Xinyang, and Liao Maoru to visit Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan tomorrow morning to inquire whether the government will still handle it uniformly this semester, or whether each school will handle it itself. If the government still handles it, please allocate the scholarship funds as soon as possible, so as not to have the same situation as last semester when the schools received the scholarship funds, the amount received was almost negligible.</p>

A sudden nightmare in Lingnan, the country is in difficulty, and the great plans to assist have not been fulfilled, I regret the material for the times."

Grieving over the separation of thousands of miles, suddenly hearing the bad news, your voice and face are gone, it is tragic, disaster struck after taking off from Hong Kong." Du Yuesheng wrote, "The bad news came at a time of crisis, the blue sky and the yellow spring extend this hatred, virtuous talent is biased and short-lived, the literary world regrets this person."

<h3>Poor Director Died for a Living: Film Stars and Fans Mourn Together</h3>
<p>The memorial service for Fang Peilin was held yesterday in the main hall of the Ningbo Native Association. Almost all film industry personnel, except those who remained in Hong Kong, attended. Because actresses Zhou Xuan, Bai Hong, Xi Qiuxia, Zhang Fan, Chen Juanjuan, Sha Li, Zhang Wan, Du [blank] Zhu, and Su Manyi were present, movie fans gathered upon hearing the news, and the main [hall] was extremely crowded. The conference was emceed by Yan Jun and presided over by Fei Mu. First, Zhou Xuan offered flowers on behalf of the attendees, and then Fei Mu requested that all the people who love film art present unanimously observe a moment of silence to express their grief, and they all rose in response. Subsequently, Fei Mu, Ren Jinping, Luo Xuelian, and Zhou Boxun delivered speeches respectively and reported on Fang's life. Fei emphasized that Fang's death was not due to fleeing, but for art and for life. The film industry should mourn the loss of a loyal worker, and the audience should sympathize with a poor artist who died tragically in the pursuit of life. Zhou Boxun had collaborated with Fang in his last work, the film "United Hearts," so his speech was particularly poignant. He said that in the years before and after the victory, many people in the film industry had died tragically, the reason for which was nothing more than "poverty" and "illness." Before the accident, Fang often rushed between Shanghai and Hong Kong for filming, busy for life. This time, unfortunately, he suffered a tragic accident. He called on the attendees not only to mourn the deceased but also to cherish the living so that everyone could contribute to the development of the Chinese film industry in their remaining years.</p>
<p>Four Methods Decided for Planning an Education Fund</p>
<p>Fang Peilin had been in the film industry for decades and was famous for his set design. In recent years, he has changed from a famous set designer to a director. His works are rich in artistic atmosphere and are the only outstanding art director in the Chinese film industry. Because of his excellent personality, he is known as "Brother Fang" in the film industry. At yesterday's memorial service, his younger brother [blank] Ting and his orphaned children Shaoyuan, Kuanyuan, Xingyuan, and Minyuan all attended with tears in their eyes. Because Fang's financial situation was poor after his death, the film industry launched a funeral committee of 47 people. Yesterday, four methods were also decided to plan an education fund for his children: (1) Starting at 1:00 pm on the 15th of this month, all film actors will perform Peking Opera at the Tianchan Stage. (2) A large-scale concert will be held around the 20th of this month, hosted by Li Jinguang, Li Junxiang, Huang Yijun, and Chen Gexin, together with film stars Bai Guang, Bai Hong, Zhou Xuan, Xi Qiuxia, Chen Juanjuan, and Zhang Fan. (3) Fang's eight works after the victory will be screened simultaneously in eight theaters in Taishi on a scheduled basis. (4) A commemorative drama will be rehearsed and performed by people from the film and theater industries. In addition, Fang's five children have reportedly been promised by Qian Xucang of Guoqiang Middle School to study at the school free of charge until they graduate from junior high school.</p>

Opening bids increased by as much as 50%, and prices were very chaotic. Actual transactions opened at around 40% higher. The highest bid for white rice was 1,550 yuan, and it was later traded at 1,450 yuan. Fine rice was priced as high as 1,500 yuan, and white rice was traded at a high price of 1,800 yuan, up about 400 yuan each. At the close, because prices were too high, buyers watched from the sidelines. Sellers, due to tighter credit, sold at high prices, and prices then fell by 50 yuan. In the North Shanghai market, white rice and fine rice both opened at 1,400 yuan, an increase of 400 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 10,495 stones arrived in the South and North Shanghai markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>First rose and then fell back, ultimately seeing an increase. At the opening, due to the rise in rice prices, people were unusually firm and bullish. Old Car and Military Ship both opened at 560 yuan. Later, due to tight credit, sellers sold at high prices. In addition, non-staple food prices fell back after rising, and people were even more uncertain. The closing price fell back within 500 yuan. Old Car flour closed at 495 yuan, and Military Ship closed at 490 yuan, the former rising 46 yuan, and the latter increasing 50 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng rose 45 to 48 yuan. The prices of Hero brand flour all opened higher, so the increase was greater. There was no closing price. Large bags of bran rose 45 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Followed the rapid rise in rice prices, but the market turned down later, resulting in a still significant increase overall. Very little yellow beans were offered. Edible beans did not open.

At the highest point, soybean oil hit the 5,000 yuan mark.

<h3>Tight Credit Situation in the Afternoon, Active Demand for Cash</h3>
<p>The interbank lending market in the city turned slightly easier yesterday morning. Remittances from other ports arrived, and the supply of funds increased. However, the national treasury spent a lot, non-staple food turnover was active, and transactions in the financial market were frequent. External supply was also abundant. The interbank lending rate was 40 yuan per month, equivalent to an interest rate of 1.2 yuan per month. The lowest rate was 25 yuan, also with some supply. In the afternoon, the money market was slightly tight, with the deposit and exchange rates remaining unchanged and the black market small. Stock prices turned down, and the closing prices of various commodities showed weakness. The trend of funds was slightly tight. Furthermore, since prices in Chongqing and Yunnan were still low, funds tended to flow out. The interbank lending rate rose to about 1.8 to 2.1 yuan per month.</p>
<p>The demand for cash was very tight yesterday, with non-financial institutions in dire need, especially shipping companies, which were aggressively seeking it. Large banknotes of 50 yuan or more had a discount of up to 8%, an even higher increase compared to Saturday.</p>
<p>The work of depositing and exchanging gold and silver continued yesterday at various handling banks and bureaus. The equalization fee remained unchanged, calculated at 7,000 yuan per tael of gold and 70 yuan per yuan of silver. The application forms issued by various banks and bureaus also remained the same. The total amount for the city was 1,200. Although the number of applicants in front of the banks was still very enthusiastic, the order was significantly better than last Saturday.</p>
<p>In order to understand the current situation of the deposit and exchange of gold and silver by various banks and bureaus in the market, the Ministry of Finance yesterday dispatched a large number of auditors to Shanghai to inspect various handling banks and bureaus and to check general accounts.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Increase Consistently</h3>

<h3>Ningbo Cotton Yarn Market Temporarily Suspended by Order</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ningbo, 10th] Trading among peers in the local cotton yarn market has recently been temporarily suspended by order due to drastic price fluctuations, in order to avoid causing factors that stimulate prices. The market will reopen after prices stabilize. The authorities will also step up efforts to ban off-market trading.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau's Export Settlement of Exchange, $3 Million US Dollars Last Year</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau's export materials have tried their best to export and exchange for a large amount of foreign exchange last year. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the bureau handled approximately US$3 million in export settlement last year. This figure was entirely obtained by supporting exporters, and does not include materials exported on behalf of the government. Among the exported materials, pig bristles and tung oil were the most numerous. The bureau is determined to strengthen this business in the current year's plan in order to benefit the balance of international payments.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tung oil market, after opening, was pushed higher because the exchange rate of the Central Bank's deposit of gold was increased and non-financial commodity prices were rising. Therefore, although the buying interest from all parties was still weak, the sentiment was extremely bullish and the quoted prices continued to rise. As a result, the trend showed repeated highlights, and prices increased significantly compared with last week.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Hovering, Fine Cloth Sees New Highs Again</h3>
<p>Due to the high underground interest rates in the cotton yarn market, retail investors could not bear the heavy burden of interest and closed out many positions. However, large investors remained optimistic and still bought on dips, resulting in a hovering situation for various yarns.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix was down slightly at 500 yuan, closing at 82,500 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon last traded at 62,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot prices stood at around 50,000 yuan, down slightly by about 2,000 yuan from before the break.</p>
<p>20-count Double Horse and Jincheng Tiannv, etc., were all traded at 46,000 yuan. 16-count Tiannv finally fell by 500 yuan. Guangming, however, remained unchanged at the original level of 41,000 yuan. Benteng was only down 300 yuan, ending at 40,700 yuan. Other yarns all showed a stable to soft trend.</p>
<p>The cloth market revealed its final sharpness again. The market was said to still be favorable for buying. Buyers were very active, and various cloths saw new highs as soon as they opened. The process continued to move towards a brisk path. Near noon, many old positions were sold for profit, and by the close, most still returned to the opening price.</p>
<p>Dragon Head fine cloth has not been sold by the spinning mill for a long time, resulting in tight spot prices in the market. Holders believe that the goods are scarce and artificially raise market prices. Therefore, market transactions cannot be carried out. It is heard that off-market bids of 2,350 yuan are still lacking sellers. Trumpet Boy fine cloth retreated from 2,130 yuan to 2,060 yuan, and then set a new high of 2,230 yuan. The afternoon close was 2,200 yuan, up 390 yuan.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen yuan twill opened at 1,950 yuan, reached a high of 2,120 yuan, and was once bid down to 1,910 yuan before the close, ultimately closing at 1,980 yuan, up 150 yuan from before the break. Four Gentlemen yuan straight tribute finally rose by 200 yuan, closing at 2,080 yuan. 190 high-end Shirting saw a new high of 4,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market started high and then fell back. Initially, due to the occasional easing and tightening of credit, long positions from the previous day were held, and bids did not fall. Later, it was heard that the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates had fallen, and non-financial textiles and cloth were also soft, and sentiment turned lower. No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 90,000 yuan in the morning. After the opening, transactions were quiet and the trend was weak. Many long positions were emotional and hurried, and the market was slightly lower. The morning session closed at 88,500 yuan, still up from last Saturday. The afternoon trend was soft, sentiment was idle, and demand from various banks was bleak. Prices fell back another 8,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The spot price of raw silk foreign exchange fell, and non-financial commodities all fell back after rising. Sentiment was not stimulated, credit in the music was still tight, and the silk weaving industry had saturated demand. Spot prices closed at 92,000 yuan. The market trend turned into consolidation. In the afternoon, retail investors continued to sell, and various commodities were generally weak. Sentiment was even more uncertain, and bids continued to fall by 2-3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, fine satin opened at a high level. In the middle, buying was strong and the market rose rapidly. The closing prices were all reported higher. Meiya bed covers opened in the morning at 47,000 yuan. Non-financial speculative funds poured in and buying intensified. Bids rose step by step, reaching a high of 52,000 yuan. Afterwards, there were high-level offloading, off-market commodity prices reported lower, raw silk and rayon all declined, the intention to offload gradually relaxed, and demand decreased sharply. The market trend was weak. The morning session closed at 50,500 yuan. In the afternoon, the general trend of commodity prices was weak. Holders still sold off and bids fell another 2-3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Speculative Activities Concentrated, Daily Necessities Soar</h3>
<p>At the end of last year, the market for daily necessities was extremely weak. Due to the winter season, the sales of daily necessities such as soap sharply decreased. At that time, the market price was roughly similar to the base price of pre-war gold and food. However, since the Lunar New Year, these commodities have been favored by general speculators. With the concentration of activities on all sides to pull up the prices, the market prices have risen sharply, and the trend of rising is quite alarming. Compared with the current market prices and the prices of gold and rice, the multiples that have risen have already exceeded one. According to people in the industry, some non-financial merchants, in view of the trend of daily necessities in the winter of the previous year, sold textiles and gold and bought soap for speculation. Although the rising trend in yesterday's market has continued for many days, it is still the object of enthusiastic pursuit by all parties. Guben increased by more than 50%, with a market price of 2,250 yuan. Few people in the actual sales are willing to cut prices below this level. Arrow knife soap was 2,200 yuan, Huang Xiangmao was 1,800 yuan, Beauty matches were 7,200 yuan, Phoenix matches were 7,000 yuan, Nanjing was 4,200 yuan, and Ningbo was 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, tea holders, in view of the rising trend of various commodities in the market that is still spreading and the sudden increase of 150% in public utilities, which is bound to increase costs, were more determined to hold on. Bids were raised sharply again and again. Therefore, although buyers still approached, negotiations fell into a stalemate and transactions were rare. The process revealed brilliance repeatedly, and prices continued to rise, and the foundation was also quite solid.</p>
<h3>Loan for Small Factories, Three Principles Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Discount Committee held its 21st meeting at 11:00 am yesterday. More than a dozen people, including Liu Gongyun, Xu Jiqing, Li Lixia, Zhao Dihua, Li Shuming, and Lin Chongyong, attended. Liu Gongyun chaired the meeting. In addition to reporting matters, the committee discussed the loan applications passed by the Industrial and Commercial Trade Advisory Committees last week, a total of 33 cases. The committee approved 23 industrial loan cases related to transportation, public utilities, coal mines, manufacturing, salt transportation and supervision, alcohol, steel, electrochemistry, and papermaking; 3 loan cases for export materials such as aluminum ingots, pig bristles, and tung oil; and rejected 7 cases. In addition, it is difficult for small factories in this city to apply for loans because they lack raw materials and quality pledges, and because of their small scale, it is difficult to negotiate bank acceptance. After various parties appealed to the committee, the committee submitted a detailed discussion yesterday and decided on three principles: (1) Small factories of various industries that continue to produce but have difficulty in working capital and urgently need to apply for loans can be jointly guaranteed by three companies and guaranteed by the industry association to apply for loans. (2) Small factories applying for loans do not need to be handled by banks; the application form can be sent to the relevant industry association for verification and then forwarded to the Central Bank's Discount Committee for review. (3) The Central Bank's Discount Committee will set up a small factory loan review committee, hire people from the industrial sector to participate, and be responsible for reviewing such applications. After approval, several banks will be designated to handle the loans.</p>
