<h3 id="c10">蘇維埃鐵幕在遠東　新疆省政的角逐是中蘇政治鬥爭　蘇聯侵略新疆方式雖異目標一貫 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>〔美國新開處紐約十一日電〕「美國之音」電台華語節目，由郭雲魁主講「蘇維埃鐵幕在遠東」，下為其所講之第五篇：</p>
<p>新疆哈蕯克叛變之用政治方式解決，是蘇聯對華兩頭蛇政策的難堪結果。中國政府因為在華北和華中共產黨問題弄得焦頭爛額，所以決定對新疆叛匪取退讓態度，請蘇聯駐迪化總領事出而調停，尋求妥恊，新疆的主席自盛世才免職以後，由吳忠信繼任，這時又由中央任命張治中接充，張為求能達成政治解決的目標，不惜對叛匪作一切可能的讓步，只求最後中國主權勉得保有。張治中在一九四七年迪化一次會議席上，曾宣稱「中央政府願以一切政權歸還新疆人民，但求國家傾土和主權得保無損」。</p>
<p>中國政府與伊犁叛匪兩方而經七個月之斡旋，討價還價，終於一九四六年一月，簽立協定，依據此項協定，叛軍承認中國的宗主權，及中央政府有權遣派軍隊，保障新疆邊境安全，防止外來侵略，中國政府方面，則給予叛軍方面以極大限度的自治權，包括編練六團官兵，維特地方治安，並有權選舉各行政區地方參議會之全體參議員，又得選出二十名新疆省府委員中之十五人。</p>
<p>據麥克連敎授在「今日新疆」一文內詳稱，中國政府能遵守約章規定，並在一九四六年底舉行自由選舉，當選代表，大多數為當地維族人士，已在省政府着手辦公，至於叛軍則並未能履行諾言，截到目前為止，中國政府軍隊並未能開入北疆三行政區，各該行政區仍在叛軍手中，受蘇聯控制。張治中亦曾作報告稱「依據議和協定，伊寗塔城和阿山三行政區可駐紥軍隊六團，但此等軍隊並未依恊約規定，交由政府加以改編」。</p>
<p>新疆的副主席阿合買提江，是曾受蘇聯訓練派在新疆活動的主要奸細，他和克浠莫夫·蕯拜爾都是左翼親蘇派或卽蘇聯編組的伊寗集團的主要人物，新疆另有右翼親華的伊士蘭集團，這集團由麥斯武德，布爾汗和前和　酋長阿明等領導，他們對蘇聯在所謂中亞土耳其「民族解放運動」中翼日俱增的勢力，非常震驚。</p>
<p>當一九四七年六月，新疆省主席張治中調任西北行政長官，而由中央任命原籍新疆出自地主和商人階級的多年中央委員麥斯武德接充新省主席的時候，伊寗集團故意表示不滿，起而反對，準備動作，依一九四七年十二月號「太平洋關係月刊」內關於「新疆的窮境」一文註釋中載稱，這個蘇聯所指導的伊寗集團，曾就麥斯武德的任命表示抗議，但以少數票反對無效，麥斯武德終於在一九四七年六月底正式就任新疆主席職務，但隨卽新疆政局，又開始動盪，到七月中旬，迪化西南的土魯番地方發生暴動，到八月二十六日，伊寗集團的頭目們自迪化撤退，到十月底，伊寗軍隊儼然又威脅迪化，正如麥克連敎授所指稱，這般叛徒又準備照一九四五年秋的企圖，依樣葫蘆，再作嘗試。</p>
<p>伊寗叛軍的蘇聯後台老板並不以此為滿足，麥克運敎授曾明白指出，在蘇聯所支持的極端份子橫施壓力之下，此等受蘇聯聳踴的當地所謂「民族主義者」，大半反華或反漢活動，有火烈的講演，集體的罷工和敵意的示威，張治中以新疆省主席身份曾於一九四七年五月出巡南疆，他的觀感曾在迪化召伊寗代表出席的一次會議上報告，後來由新疆日報在一九四七年八月十四日刊載，由大公報在一九四七年八月二十五日至三十日加以轉載，他曾宣稱「關於疏附的情形，我可以說，現在當地的空氣，對我們國家和國軍利益，很不友好，長此以往，我們為實現議和恊定和維護省政府威望的一切努力，都被破壞無餘，我希望此後疏附當局不再以一黨一派的利益為基準而根本忽略全國的利益，麥克連敎授並特別指稱，蘇聯各領館對伊寗叛變集團經常取精巧和現代化的宣傳技術，蘇聯所指揮的伊寗集團一直在動員很多小學敎師·醫生·技工·和在新疆的中下級社會人士，他們的宣傳特別看重新疆的維族和鄰近各蘇維埃社會主義共和國在「民族」和文化方面的關係。</p>
<p>張治中對代表蘇聯利益的新疆叛亂設法政治解決的主要手段是妥協態度，張氏曾自稱：「因副主席阿合買提江和省政府其他伊寗委員，僅形成少數，不能希望通過所提出的任何議案，所以我從不使用職權為他們的提案交付表決，我每遇與少數意見有不一致時，我向來是用談判和讓步的例證，實在多至不能枚舉，結果外界人士都誤認我不能阻止伊寗集團控制新疆的一切」，但張治中談話裏承認他對蘇聯所控制的伊寗集團使用妥恊態度的失敗。他說：「儘管我曾為求省政合作而作一切的讓步和努力，但新疆的情勢實在是由軍事的衝突過渡到政治的敵對，如是而論，政治解決的幻覺不得不轉化而為政治鬥爭的現實了。</p>
<p>新疆省政的角逐，乃是中國和蘇聯的政治鬥爭，麥克連敎授曾指明，如果沒有外界干涉，右翼親華的伊士蘭集團可能勝過左翼親蘇的所謂民族主義集團，但是新疆的未來是要看中國中央政府和蘇聯政府可能施於該省壓力總和的比較而定，麥克連敎授曾指稱伊寗集團，因有蘇聯支持，已經在新疆全省用人行政和例行省政方面有好大的勢力，這可拿張治中的演詞來證實，他說在一九四七年依和約條款舉行的各行政區專員選舉時，「省政府早將各項規則公佈週知，卽可迅圖實現，但阿合買提江副主席和其他伊寗省委皆建議緩辦，理由是他們明知如選舉在那時舉行，他們的集團無法控制此項選舉，再則如果他們所不喜歡的各區行政長官連選連任，他們也不能有任何表示，張治中還作類似的訴怨，說伊寗集團阻止他將新疆學院改為國立天山大學的建議，統一幣制的方案和延長現有鐵路到迪化的計劃，伊寗集團的這些伎倆顯然都在想將新疆和中國切斷，助長蘇聯在新疆的利益，準備再度將新疆拖到我國鐵幕之後。</p>
<p>新疆回亂的政治解決，至此全然失敗，在蘇聯卵翼下的所謂「東土耳其斯坦共和國」依然存在，而且正圖擴張，麥克連敎授報稱，伊寗的叛軍政府已建立特種行政體系，收稅，辦報紙和宣傳並訓練正規軍，張治中曾承認，如今早在一九四六年一月簽立議和恊定以後，伊寗·塔城·阿山三區「依然保持特殊地位，吾人深深感到倘此特殊情况曠時日久，其他各族之分崩離拆更有可能」，麥克連敎授亦强調此項危機，說道蘇聯在經濟上，地理上都比中國佔優勢，可以對新疆施用壓力，「除非新疆境內的反蘇力量能受外界支持，新疆似乎將再度受蘇聯控制」。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京十三日電〕日本對各盟國之賠償，根據美國之政策，卽將停止。日本迄今已付出之賠償品，僅值二千三百九十餘萬美元，與最寬大之約翰斯頓報告及溫和之史揣克報告等所建議者，相距甚遠。美方對日本賠償數目之歷次建議如下：一九四七年四月，陸海軍聯合委員會大致根據鮑萊報告建議之數字，為六億一千六百四十八萬美元。一九四八年二月，史揣克建議為四億一千二百零四萬美元。一九四八年四月，約翰斯頓報告建議為一億六千五百五十六萬一千八百五十美元。我駐日賠償代表團今晨發表聲明稱：僅日本政府所屬陸海軍兵工廠設備之一部份，曾被拆運充作賠償品，其他私人戰爭工業，則原封未動。</p>

<p>這幾天來，上海公私各級學校為了希望軍隊不駐學校，或避免將校舍充作傷兵醫院。校長們一齊向敎育局長請求，保衛敎育，保衛下一代。校長們平日常為師生們的米·油·柴·菜所困惱，衝不出一條光明之路，近又為校舍奔走，他們滿身大汗，滿懷憂急，到處託人情，說好話，希望保全學校，絃歌不輟，但仍不免吃閉門羹，碰釘子，他們用心良苦，我們實表無限同情。</p>
<p>過去因為社會組織不健全，老百姓眼光太近視，士兵智識不太高，學校責任未全盡，軍事與敎育脫節，軍隊與學校隔膜，走着「戰時重將，平時重相」的一條路，無形中造成「敎育最末」的陳舊觀念。甚且有人說，上海目前只要社會局以安內，警察局以攘外，其他各局似皆多餘。其實他們沒有想到，社會是整個的有機體，警察局社會局好比一個入的手足，敎育·衛生和財政等局，一如人的腦·胃和血脈，手足健全了，腦·胃·血脈病弱，手足豈能獨有力氣，何况手足行動，全恃腦的指揮，胄的營餐，血脈的流通。敎育猶諸乎們人的腦。是以蔣總裁抗戰時，再說：立國的要素有三，一曰敎育，二曰武力，三曰經濟。而敎育為武力和經濟的總樞紐。良以武力和經濟都須敎育而產生而滋養血完成其使命。無怪文明各國在槍林彈雨中，必須要上到最後一課，方肯罷休。</p>
<p>敎育行政當局往日對軍隊和學校，軍事和敎育，極少聯繫，極少關係，向無政策，向無計劃，即使有政策，有計劃，也多行不通，於是事到臨頭抱佛脚，頭痛醫頭，頭仍痛，脚痛醫脚，脚難愈。結果，往往一籌莫展，不了了之，表面上看來，受苦的是學校，吃虧的是學生；然而淸算起來，近點說，這筆賬還要寫在戰爭的勝敗記錄上。遠點說，民族國家受暗損。</p>
<p>孫子用兵，「全國為上，破國　之，全軍為上，破軍次之，……全伍為上，破伍次之」。對於軍伍尙捨不得攻破，對於民族命脈所繫的敎育，可以保全何苦不去保全。孫子兵法劈頭就說：「故經之以五事，校之計而索其情：一曰道，二曰天，三曰地，四曰將，五曰法。」他把「道」放在第一，他說，「道者，會民與上同意也，故可以與之死，可以與之生，而不畏危。」「道」不是空洞的東西，它代表政府和人民的關係，是爭取民衆的工具。孫子把戰爭分為四等，第一等戰爭是「伐謀」，第二等是「伐交，」第三等為「伐兵」，第四等為「攻城」，而以「伐謀」為策之最上。「伐謀」係攻心，即近代的政治戰，心理戰，亦即冷戰，倘運用得好，便可造成「無智名」，「無勇功」的勝利，這種不流血的戰爭是最經濟，但最緊要的是「道」，這個「道」字是取得民心的唯一武器，是獲得勝利的唯一資本。人民需要敎育，政府給他們敎育，此乃「知與之為取，政之實也。」這就可以「令民與上同意。」這就可以不戰而勝。至少在「伐兵」「攻城」時百戰百勝。</p>
<p>軍隊住城實有弊無利，會國藩練湘軍，在素質上立定一個簡單的標準，不要游卒滑弁，他在奏疏上說，只擇「鄉民壯健樸實者，練一人收一人之益，練一日，有一日之效。」與彭筱房。會香海書云：「無取浮華之輩，而求工作之類。」這表示鄉問農民，保存了固有的實和勇敢，未曾沾染浮華的習氣比較容易收效。</p>
<p>傷兵醫院現急應籌備就緒，但傷兵未到前，仍宜留有隙地，讓原來的機關保存固有的工作，不必全部佔據或作他用。據聞今需一萬只傷兵病床，預備的十所跳舞廳，約三千病床，其餘七千病床止在學校身上打念頭，其實大可不必。上海有的是娛樂塲和高樓大廈，何必一定要征用學校，使千萬學生失學！</p>
<p>要知今日上海市內學校，一校校舍，已作數校之用有的已作六七校之用了，它們借給郊外學校上課，又借給被疏散學校的師生作安身之處，復借放儀器圖書，還有走廊裏睡滿着難童，自己的學生分為上下午二部制敎課了，萬一再駐軍隊，或改作傷兵醫院，流離失所的豈止一二個學校問題，四散於社會，其影饗可知。我們竭誠希望軍事當局在道次戰爭中，還能保衛下－代！</p>
<h3 id="c22">濃霧中的人造閃電 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>—安全指導飛機降落</p>
<p>（廣州美國新聞處特譯）</p>
<p>光耀奪目的人造閃電，近來在美國的濃霧籠罩着的機塲中，指導飛機安全降落地面，一排大小如香烟盒的射光燈，曾在加州的阿卡達城附近的降落輔助姑，發射出閃電似的光芒，穿過濛霧極濃的空際，指導飛機向跑道上降落。不久的將來，它們就會帮助大批的定期班機降落在紐約的國際機塲。</p>
<p>這種新式的發光體，它本身就是一件重要的新聞。可是，它的發明的內幕，還有一個戲劇性的故事，這故事特別對於的實騐者更有戲劇性的情節。</p>
<p>在最近的戰爭期中，克利夫蘭（在俄亥俄州）的一位威士丁廠研究員班魯君，曾為美國海軍研究各種較好的新式探照燈，花去了他許多正常的工作時間。</p>
<p>當他的光帶實騐工作有了進展的時候，他便幻想着想過濃霧的射光問題。當他得空的時候，他便拿着紙筆和計算尺在工作着。結果，他想出了這問題的一些數學的答案。</p>
<p>後來班魯在一種特別的「超級光」中發現了他的閃電的光源，這種「超級光」是在大戰期間由威士丁廠的研究工程師所發明而為夜間空中攝影之用的。這燈有一個細長的石英管，充滿着氪氣，它是自然稀有氣體之一。</p>
<p>當一種高壓電的强電流從一個細小的人工閃電發動機經由這氣體而發出來的時候，這燈便發射出光耀奪目的閃光。它在每一平方英寸中有九百英燭光，比陽光强九倍。這燈確能發出一種閃光，歷時一秒之一百分之十七，或約等於自然閃電發射時間的十分之一。</p>
<p>班魯氏確信，氪氣燈的閃光能透過最濃的濛霧。他的其次問題便是要發現這種强有力的閃光對飛行員的眼睛可有什麼影饗。</p>
<p>他在他屋後的私家車房（能放兩部汽車的）裏解決了那個問題。他在那裏裝置有各種不同的閃光，並裝置各種光學測騐儀器和官感的紀錄設備。他為了要找尋實騐的對象，他邀請他的家人和許多朋友，且召集了許多鄰居的靑年人來參觀他的閃光，當地十來歲的兒童，放棄他們的遊戲前來參觀的不止一處，班魯便慢慢地增加閃光的强度，直至兒童的眼睛睜不開時為止。</p>
<p>當他以家庭的設備在他後院子裏的實騐室工作之時，他發現當眼睛適應了黑暗的時候—如航空員在晚上飛行—睛簾對於歷時較一秒之千分之一短的光度的任何變化，都不致發生影響。從家庭實騐室中的這些實騐裏，便產生山氪氣燈和氖氣燈的混合發光器，而為威士丁廠公司的新式射光器。</p>
<p>不久以前，美國空軍有一架C－45式的運輸機，在克利夫蘭附近的上空，其引擎發生了故障。駕駛員於以無綫電和該地機塲通話時，接到了一個驚人的消息說，該機接近地面的高度以三百英尺為限。可是，他決定設法降落。在三次企圖發現機塲的努力均告失敗之後，當航空站人員怖置着機塲的指示降落的設備及威士丁廠實騐的閃電之時，這駕駛員幾乎想轉向他往，冒險去找尋較好的氣侯。當駕駛員再事企圖降落之時，他已跟着指示降落設備的信號，面對着航空站而獲見六種光耀奪目的閃光了。當這架飛機載着七名空勤人員和卅二位旅客安全抵達地面時，駕駛員對地面觀察人員說，假如沒有班魯君的人造閃電，他是「無法降落」的了。</p>
<h3 id="c23">台灣省推行　三七五减租 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>〔台北訊〕陳誠來台灘做主席，雖然還不到六個月，但他治理這美麗寶島的藍圖方案，却是最遠大和最有理想的。他首先提出了「人民至上」和「民生第一」的鮮明旗幟，一切為着百姓，一切為着人民。同時，在他的智囊團裏，容納了不少熟悉和研究英國政治的專家，想把英國工黨政府的社會主義政策，隨着中間偏左的路綫，移植到這寶島來，好好的幹一下，澈底的實行民生主義，敎台灣六百五十萬人民富足樂業的生長起來。</p>
<p>於是台灣今年重大的工作，就是推行「三七五」减租運動，這也就是實行土地改革的初步工作。陳誠主席對於「三七五」减租的推行已抱着最大的決心，也是全省人民的公意，積極澈底去推行。四月份做的是準備工作，五月份進一步來講習，大量培養推行的幹部，使全省的每一個村落都能暸解「三七五」减租的要點：到六月份就要全部動員，分別訂立租約，全省有六千三百零二個村（里），那時候就要動員一萬五千人來推行這個偉大的工作，同時省的三七五减租督導委員會也隨着成立，給台灣踏上了樂觀的前途。</p>
<p>台灣全省六百五十萬人口中，佃農村就佔了二百六十萬人，過去地主徵收地租尙達百分之五十五至百分之七十五，佃農實在是負担太重受盡了剝削，得不到溫飽，台省府根據這個事實和針對目前的需要，擬好了一個辦法，用以彌補過了的缺憾，免除地主佃農雙方的糾紛，並力求地主和佃儂今後的合作。這個辦法說起來倒非常簡單：（一）依照行政院的規定，其地租租額不得超過正產物全年收穫總量千分之三百七十五，其約定租額超過千分之三百七十五，不及千分之三百七十五者依其約定；（二）出租人按法律規定，將其出租土地收回自耕時，每戶總面積加以限制；（三）减租後地主所繳田賦又其他捐稅亦照减；（四）去年未測的地租，也要依照「三七五」减租。</p>
<p>現在，台灣各縣市都在努力辦理這項工作，而且得到了農民羣的擁護，雖然無知地主方面，給了政府推行這偉大工作的阻力，但並不大，尤其是在南部的屏東，這一「三五七」减租的準備工作，做到最為完善良好。因為「三七五」减租工作，不單是對佃農有利，地主也得到了保障。台灣將順利完成這安定民生，繁榮社會的工作，現正向光明理想的大道邁進。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十二日電〕「紐約時報」今日稱，國務院遠期計劃局長李楠將在四國外長會議中，建議將四國佔領軍撤退，而集中於德國三港口。美軍集中於白萊門，英軍集中於漢堡，蘇軍集中於斯丹丁，法軍則駐於法國境內之斯特拉斯堡。此事已經此間權威人士證實。但若干報紙謂四國對此事已獲協議一點，則屬不確。美蘇兩方面對此建議，不願表示其態度。法國美大使館則謂，至今日正午為止，並未獲悉此消息。美國權威方面向本社記者強調稱，此計劃確實存在，但「僅為一計劃」，而法國之反應將被首先考慮。同一人士又謂，法國共黨對此建議之反應或利用，亦將預先考慮，但蘇聯若同意此舉，則共黨卽不致表示反對。此間認為傑塞普及國務院顧問波倫會對此事加以討論。</p>

<p>盟軍司令並未改變憲法之字句，但作六項保留，盟軍司令復向波恩制憲議會道賀其在困難環境下，圓滿完成此艱難任務。憲法旣經盟方批准，德人逐步舉行選舉，或許在七月中旬舉行，俾在國會兩院之外有一政府，設總統與總理各一人。盟軍司令對於憲法所作保留如下：（一）通知德人弗忘行政與立法兩項權力，均須受盟國佔領軍命令之限制。（二）聯邦政府從西德各邦徵用警察之權力，以得盟軍當局特別核准時為限。（三）不詳。（四）非待和約簽訂，不能實行改變西德邊境之特殊權力。（五）說明德國各邦給予聯邦政府之若干立法權，須經盟方愼密檢討。（六）審愼限制聯邦政府從各邦接掌權力，以求經濟平等之權。波恩制憲議會擬設一十八人「執行委員會」，執行政府工作，以待西德政府正式成立一節盟軍司令旣未加以批准，亦未否決。美軍總司令克萊稱，此項問題留待西德佔領區十一邦之行政長官辦理。</p>
<p>建都地點將重考慮</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社法蘭克十二日電〕消息靈通人士稱，各佔領軍首長主張將柏林加入西德聯邦共和國中，成為第十二個邦，且將請各地方議會主席負責處理今後之政務，至西德政府成立後為止。對於政府地點一項，各佔領軍長官亦認為不妥，要求各代表重行考慮其決議。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十二日電〕西德制憲議會代表今日在柏林美軍區內，向三十萬德人之會中演說，對德國東西兩區合併後，整個德國可能被「布爾希維克化」一點，表示憂懼，西德議會社會民主黨集團之領袖計密，將謂東區及柏林目下之情形，使惡勢力可自由進入西德。波恩制憲議會主席亞丹諾繼之演說稱，柏林已成為對東方之前哨，德國人民對將來不應過分樂觀，亦不應太悲觀。基督敎民主黨之愷撒宣稱，祖國之大部份今日仍籠罩於黑暗下，且謂，西德人民並未忘却蘇軍區中之同胞。柏林社會民主黨領袖諾曼最後演說謂，德人不願成為唯命是從者。彼對東德區中之社會統一黨猛烈抨擊稱，希特勒必曾在總統府中遺下某種政治方法，而被社會統一黨所利用。彼要求東方政治家退出柏林，「蓋彼等之行為，乃希特勒政權之作孽。」</p>

<p>〔合衆社柏林十二日電〕柏林英佔區內十二日有十一人，因分發向蘇方登記之報紙而被捕。據蘇方主持之ADM通訊社稱，彼等亦曾被毆，此為封鎖解除以來首次重要麻煩事件。ADM通訊社最先披露此事，西區警官予以證實，但否認被捕者曾受毆打。在柏林封鎖期際，蘇聯曾禁向盟方登記之刊物在蘇佔區內分發，盟方亦以同樣禁令加以報復。但自封鎖解除後，蘇方卽取消此令，美方繼之，但英法二方則未曾採取此項行動。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十二日電〕英下院今日以三百卅三票對六票之絕對多數，通過批准大西洋公約。反對者為共黨議員二人，獨立工黨議員二人，及左傾工黨議員二人，另有工黨議員六人自動棄權。貝文外相今日在下院揭開辯論時稱，彼相信下院，英國全國，及全世界愛好和平之人民，皆將接受大西洋公約，貝文謂，「聯合國雖已成立，對義及東歐各國之和約雖已簽訂，吾人今日仍面臨一東歐國家之集團，此集團為造成歐洲分裂之第一步故意行動。」述及柏林封鎖之解除，貝文謂，「封鎖將於今日解除，余深信大西洋公約各國之密切聯合，已使蘇聯再度考慮其對柏林所取之行動。蘇聯之政策為口中呼籲和平，且攻擊他人為煽動戰爭者，但同時則造成各國之不安。鑒于此種情形，吾人卽不得不認為一切被視為破壞目標而意志相同之人民應團結一致，並非企圖進攻而僅為防禦。蘇聯之極權方法，已使愛好和平之人民獲得更大諒解，團結更密。」述及大西洋公約時，貝文稱，政府若不採取措置以確保其防禦，卽為未盡其對國家對世界之責任。彼謂一部份人攻擊此公約為一侵略武器，但若在一九一四年及一九三九年卽成立此公約，則已往二次大戰皆可能避免。「余欲強調公約之眞正目的為防衛。吾人欲確保一九三〇至一九四一年間之情形，不致再度發生。」在結論時，貝文稱，「北大西洋公約為若干國家間進行集體防衛之措置，余深信吾人已採取進至和平一最偉大之步驟。吾人將為和平之保衛者及堅決反對侵略者，吾人將集合所有之物資，以提高全世界人羣之生活水凖。」貝文演說後，保守黨領袖邱吉爾起立稱，彼對外長之演說表示同意。繼謂，「余對外長並不將柏林封鎖之解除視為一重要之和平舉動，感覺欣慰」。邱氏謂，反對黨方面亦造成大西洋公約，且謂，「吾人對美國所担任之偉大任務，表示右旋，蓋美國為造成大西洋公約之最主要者」。邱氏繼稱，造成大西洋公約，白魯塞爾協定及歐洲議會之聯合力量，乃對和平安全最穩固之保障。述及西班牙問題時，邱吉爾謂，彼認為西班牙之未參加大西洋公約，乃西歐戰略上之一個缺口。且謂，彼對外相贊成與西班牙恢復外交關係一點，感覺欣慰，「目下余要求者，僅為此點，余認為與其採取「黑市」式之外交政策，不如明白派遣一大使」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十三日廣播：成功湖訊，聯大政委會以壓倒多數，否決關於解決義前殖民地三處之蘇聯方案。該方案主張准許里比亞及伊里特利亞於五年內獨立，索瑪里應於十年內獨立，同時該三處由聯合國託治委員會任命之行政官管理之，並指定若干區域為戰略區域，置於會管轄之下。本案因西方國家之竭力反對而遭否決。旋政委會復投票否決主張聯合集體託治之印度建議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十三日電〕聯合國政治委員會十三日淸晨完成其處置前義大利殖民地之辯論，將於上午十時半復會，表決將否以貝文與史福蕯之建議提交聯合國全體大會。五十九國政治委員會言論該問題者已歷五週，在該委會之主要建議，係由英國所提出及由西方國家支持，其中原則係上週杪英外相貝文及義外長斯福蕯在倫敦所協議者。此一計劃為蘇聯·亞洲·阿拉伯集團竭力反對。該計劃將以里比亞分予英法義三國，允於十年內獨立。將索瑪里蘭交還義大利，並將伊里特利亞分予阿比西尼亞及英埃蘇丹。</p>

<p>〔合衆社柏林十二日電〕柏林封鎖雖已解除，盟方當局及德人仍懷疑的注視俄人。空運仍在繼續，其意義為一種警吿，意謂西方國家對冷戰中可能新戰爭有所準備。封鎖解除後數小時，蘇聯發動頗有聲勢之宣傳運動，欲參加管制魯爾工業區。</p>
<p>據披露，英美決繼續空運，直至柏林貯有二十萬噸食物後，以防蘇聯有任何詭計。迄十二日正午之廿四小時中，盟方飛機共飛行一千零八次，運抵柏林之供應品共計九千零四十七噸。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十二日電〕卸任德境美軍司令克萊今日吿歡然慶祝封鎖解除之柏林市民稱，彼等已取得自由，應聯合蘇聯佔領之德國共同保衛彼等之自由。克萊係在柏林西區市議會特別會議中致詞道別，謂渠亦與德人同樣，切望德國統一。聽衆聞言，歡呼雷動。但克萊又警吿稱，「但決不能犧牲波恩新憲法所保證之自由以取得統一。」波恩憲法係西德政治領袖擬定，作為永久性西德政府之基礎，蘇佔領區之德人並未參加。克萊復稱，封鎖結束，其意義不僅在火車與卡車重又行駛而已，尚有更切之意義。柏林人民已取得自由之權，將為各地愛好自由之人所接受。英法軍司令均將同意我人一如諸君欲見德國統一，但統一之到來，決不可犧牲甫在波恩通過憲法所保證之自由。柏林市民之選取自由，準備接受犧牲以保自由者，與英美空運飛行員同為「封鎖中之眞正英雄。」</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕美國今日突然命令麥帥終止移交日本機械工具及其他工業設備與中，菲，荷，英四國，為恢復日本自給之新步驟。同時美代表麥考埃向十一國遠東委員會明白宣佈，美國將反對恢復賠償支付之任何提議，並能在委員會中運用否決權，以阻止此項之表決。</p>
<p>日本需要一切資源，以减少其對於美援之依賴性。日美兩國已不能繼續等待太平洋國家決定日能賠償多少，及應如何分配。自一九四七年四月麥帥開始預先交付日本賠償物品後，已將拆卸日本軍需工廠所得之機械工具約二萬件，移交中，菲，荷，英四國，日本並曾由其被扣之海外資產中交付鉅額賠償，據其他官方估計，不下三十餘億美元。蘇聯在紅軍佔領東北時所獲最多。各國對日要示賠償共達數百億，菲律賓要求佔總賠償額百分之十五，中國要求百分之四十，澳洲百分之二十八，英國百分之二十五，荷蘭，蘇聯及法國各百分之十二，印度百分之十二·五，紐西蘭百分之二，加拿大百分一一·五。美國原要求百分之二十九，後乃自願放棄，以之分配於其他國家，並曾一再努力，促令各國早日成立協議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十三日電〕麥帥今日對美國下令停止裝運日本賠償物資一事，不願立卽表示意見。此出人意外之舉動，雖博得日人歡迎，但已引起中菲兩國發言人之反對。據中國發言人稱，日本具有戰爭潛力之工業，至今尚未觸及。美國關於臨時賠償之行動，諒將使整個賠償問題明朗化，此點仍為盟國必須予以解決之主要問題之一。</p>

<p>〔聯合社成功湖十三日電〕菲律賓出席聯合國代表團長羅慕洛十二日宣稱，美國決定停止拆卸日本工廠作賠償品，不免使予吃驚。四星期前予會代表菲律賓政府向華盛頓遠東委員會發表聲明，請美國確定日本賠償政策，今對麥考埃將軍之聲明不免為之茫然，正在靜待政府訓令。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十三日電〕菲律賓駐日代表團長阿勃萊拉今日宣稱，美國停止日本繼續移交賠償物資之政策，不免似是而非。就予個人意見言，日本經濟將不勝空閒停工各廠之負擔，目前已因補助經濟之重累，及原料之奇缺，而搖搖欲倒。其空閒各廠，雖可供戰時被蹂躪國家之利用，但不能有助於日本經濟。</p>
<p>英並未同意取消日賠償</p>
<p>但對美決定未便有作為</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕美國已決定停止自日本取得賠償物資之消息傳抵此間後，倫敦方面，反應殊為冷淡。外交部發言人拒絕對此事發表意見。該項決議係由美國駐十一國遠東委員會代表麥考埃少校宣布。據云英國於事先曾接獲簡短的通知，貝文外相昨在下院答議員問時，曾聲明英國並未同意取消日本之賠償，惟此間人士同時亦指出，由於駐日佔領費之全由美國財政部負担，故英國亦未便堅持須由日本繼續給付賠償。英國政府在有關日本之事務中，其決定權與對德事務之決定不同，故美政府若最後決定取消日本之賠償，英國除接受此項決議外，殊未便有其他作為。觀察家並指出美國之廢止遠東委員會的賠償計劃，有兩點可能引起的後果：一為遠東諸盟邦之將不獲賠償；一為美國復興日本經濟的政策，可能忽略在安全上應注意的事項。</p>
<p>美聲明全文</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十二日電〕美國將不再運行發表指令之權利，以繼續核准搬出日本之配備充作賠償。遠東委會美代表麥考埃少將在本日國務院所發表之聲明中宣稱：日本之經濟局勢已發展至如此程度，茍欲使日本達到任何程度之復蘇，卽不能有更多之工業配備被搬走。麥考埃謂，此一事實以及美國雖不斷努力而猶未能解決賠償問題一點，已促使美國政府取消先前主張以初步賠償品移交予盟國之步驟。此間之官員承認，此項聲明之含義，卽為日本賠償之終止，並停止依照初步移交賠償品計劃再以機械器材交予中國，聯合王國，菲律賓與荷蘭。彼等表示有關此事之指令，不久卽將致送予東京盟軍統帥麥克阿瑟將軍。麥考埃說明使美國採取目前立塲之主要原因如下：「（甲）日本經濟之支絀，在最近之將來，甚少平衡之希望，最後如欲達到平衡將需要日本所支配之全部資源。（乙）搬運日本進步之賠償物資，此種負担對於穩定日本經濟及准其趨向自給自足之佔領目標，可能發生嚴重之影響。（丙）遠東委員會對於擬訂賠償分額表一事，雖經美國在過去三年迭次自動予以協助，但甚少或竟無完成協定之希望。旣無賠償分額表之協定，則遠東委員會目前關於賠償問題之一切政策決議，自無法執行。（丁）日本由於放棄其以前之海外資產，已付去不少賠償，並在提前移交之計劃下，亦已付去較少之賠償」。麥考埃又稱：鑒于此等結論，「美政府不得不取消一九四七年四月四日之臨時指令，而終止該指令所規定之提前移交計劃。同時美政府不得不撤其一九四七年十一月六日關於日本賠償分額之建議，並據此通知秘書長。最後，美政府乘此機會宣佈無意在其臨時指令之權限下，採取進一步之單邊行動，再向日本搬運賠償物資」。麥考埃稱：「吾人當前之問題，並非為限制日本之和平工業，而為復興此種工業，以供給日本最低限度之需要」。渠稱：為解決此項問題起見，美國建議「准許日本無限制發展其和平工業」。渠宣稱：此種發展包括利用「主要之戰爭設備」，此等設備早已除去「戰爭設備」之特性。關於此點渠續稱：「美國認為，所有設備，包括目前指定為賠償之用之「重要戰爭設備」，其能有助於日本復興者，應加以利用。此種設備乃日本和平經濟所必需。」但渠強調美國繼續支持一項原則，卽不應允許日本恢復其從事戰爭之力量。美國計劃立卽要求遠東委員會通過有關日本而與渠所闡明立塲一致之建議。關於政府目前對日本賠償問題之立場，官塲咸感美國已採取一切合理步驟，以獲致賠償問題之正式解決辦法，俾在日本造成一種為工業復興所必需之安定心理，在若干有關解決之提案　　中，彼等追述在一九四七年十一月，美國曾向遠東委會提出賠償百分比例表，臚舉對遠東委會所有十一國家之賠償額。中國與美國所得最大。但美國建議：茍其他國家接受該表，則美國幾願放棄其全部所得賠償額分與他國。此項建議因牽涉政治廚房因素，亦如其他建議同樣未被接受。</p>

<h3 id="c73">杭州撤守前後 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 綠州</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕五月一日淸晨四時許，杭州卽在睡眼惺忪中被密集的砲聲所驚醒，市民都懷着沉重的心情在探索砲聲的來源。黎明後，商店均未開門，街頭情况異常凄凉，官巷口一帶銀牛也寥寥無幾，大頭價一落千丈，金圓劵已無人要，零星交易均以銀元計價，大餅油條一付，有討價兩角者，惟米價甚廉，每担約四元左右。街頭行人幾乎絕跡，僅偶而巡邏之救火車風馳電掣而過，憾人心目。惟各報仍照常營業，爭出號外，銷路奇佳，一般人均抱着暴風雨必來之念頭，倒也置之坦然了。</p>
<p>二日傍晚，隆隆之砲聲已斷斷續續，至三日晨則完全逞寂沉狀態，空氣非常寗靜，宛如暴風雨已經過去，是日且天晴氣朗，市民均以一種莫明奇妙的心情探首街頭，相互交頭接耳，彼此探詢。筆者為明瞭眞象起見，特走訪駐於大佛寺附近陸軍病院內之七十七師新採組，然沿途中正路·湖濱·市政府一帶均已戒嚴，滿載物資之大卡車絡連而過，經筆者出示證件，煞費唇舌方允通過至市政府附近，一自衛隊臨時員警吿余，謂共軍已至離城四十里之羅店子，松木塲一帶交通已斷抵新採組後，屋內已搬運一空，僅少數兵士尚在整理剩餘物件。筆者向彼等探詢，均不得要領，僅言共軍尚在四五十里外。於是筆者再乘車至省府秘書處以及各有關機關探訪，彼等亦於二日晚奉命撤離，室內空空，情况淒淸，方知情形嚴重。</p>
<p>中午至滬最後班車開出，滿載軍人家眷，並搶運物件。多數逃難市民被阻站外，未能上車。自下午四時許，突聞轟然數響，後經筆者探訪，方悉浙省保安司令部及團隊已由杭州撤離向新陣地，五時許，與滬方電訊連絡中斷。六時許，街頭有「國民黨革新委員會」之佈吿貼出，佈吿市民安心營業，切勿自擾，協助共軍入城以及接收各機關及公用事業機構等語，出佈吿人為杭市治安大隊總隊長張天義，副隊長鄭玉明。且傳聞共軍先頭部隊四千餘人已至市政府，湖濱旅館一帶，市民秩序尚稱良好。至晚，突見松木塲方向紅光滿天，黑烟蔽空，且有稀疏槍聲，實際情况不明，惟一般市民又頓起恐慌，紛紛携箱籠而逃。筆者隨老母以大頭一圓之代價雇三輪車一架，往南星橋烏龍廟友人周君處暫避，車至水師前直街，倉橋直街，鳳山門外直街，南星期一帶，均為擁塞之市民及箱籠什物所阻。至周君家已深夜一時。聞三郎廟義渡碼頭有船可至海鹽，乃又伴老母至河畔，惟河畔難民紛紛搶先上船，妻離子散，號哭之聲，慘不忍聞，至四日淸晨四時許，始以七塊大頭及一錢重金戒一只之代價雇得雙帆漁船一隻，同船十四人分撰船費，船上有一破衫老人，交談之下，方悉彼乃杭州某中學校長，對此次共軍入城之一切，深感嘆息。</p>
<p>上船後，因終日奔波倦甚，入於昏睡狀態，於四日眩目之陽光中離開杭州。沿江逃難船隻，絡續不絕，碧波盪漾，遠山瀝瀝，懷着沉重的心情，離開了杭州，遙望雲天，不標感慨叢生。</p>
<h3 id="c74">天山蒙古王子婚禮 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— 龔覺民</p>
<p>春曲初奏</p>
<p>提起班郡王，游牧在天山南北的蒙古人，沒有一個不讚美他是英雄的，他是博斯騰湖西北岸和碩特部落的領袖，生來非常英武，據現在和碩縣副助長道爾吉——留蘇的一個進步的蒙古靑年——吿訴我，班郡王當年在焉耆曾親自率領一個蒙古兵團，打敗了和加尼牙子以後，又去打朶司令馬仲英，正把馬仲英打得落花流水喘息不定的時候，盛世才就以他慣用的「陰謀暴動」的罪名把班郡王押進了牢獄，班郡王自認為很忠實於當時的政府，做夢也沒想到會有橫禍飛來，無緣無故蒙受了這種不白之冤，不久就活活的氣死了。這次和天山蒙古王子結婚的新娘梨傑小姐就是班郡王的遺下的唯一愛女，班郡王娶有三個太太，第一與第二個太太沒有生育，梨傑是班郡王第三妻班勒琪生的，班勒琪在班郡王死後改嫁了，嫁給一個平凡的蒙民，她現在還只三十多歲；這樣梨傑無父無母，孤苦零丁的，被繼承班郡王的達瓦郡王撫養着，在博斯騰湖邊岸的草原上牧放着羊羣，像一個很平凡的牧女，渡着她生來是很聰明的，她會輕盈的蒙古歌舞，會彈蒙古古琴「脫克西窩特」，也在蒙古學校裏念過幾天書，本來她已經許配給和碩前警局陶副局長（蒙族）的少爺了。可是去年，滿漢王的兒子滿光強承襲父位稱恭漢王以後，他的生母鳥靜彬覺的兒子已長大成人，立業成家可以同時進行，這時候和碩特與和靖兩個部落的頭目就提起聯姻的事來。據說有一天在博斯騰湖邊岸的草原上，集合了很多個蒙古少女，讓恭漢王親自來揀擇，在少女叢中，不用說，梨傑自然變成恭漢王唯一的意中人了，因為梨傑不但很聰明，而且很美麗，再加上那嫵媚而又含情脈脈的雙眸，蛋形的面龐乍看來很像她的母親，身材不高不矮。莊靜，溫柔，豐盈的體態在在都流露着靑春少女的魅力，她生於二十三年十二月二十九日巳時，現在才十五歲，正是荳蔻年華的妙齡女郎，難怪恭漢王會對她一見鐘情了。經過這神話故事般的美麗的一天，才由兩部落頭上的正式說合，梨傑和靑年的蒙古王便在今年元月六號正式訂婚了。</p>
<p>湖濱吹起了一則柔情的春曲，從此梨傑再也不感到寂寞了，隨着春天的來臨，春風吹縐了一池澄靜的湖水，似乎更溫暖了梨傑的心，在婚期一天天逼近的飛逝底日子中，「給我姆娜」的進行曲子是越奏越昂揚越緊張了。</p>
<p>婚禮前夕</p>
<p>在婚期的前一天，新郎恭漢王騎着一匹很不平凡的焉耆名馬，往女家去迎接新娘。這匹馬的口齒和牽馬者的年齡都是經過推算的馬的鞍轡和全身也都妝扮的非常華美。據說在二十五日的黎明那時候和碩灘上蒙古包裏的人，一個個都已經喝得醉薰薰的，同時一個個也是悲戚戚的，在梨傑離和碩灘前的一剎那，全部落的男女大小都眞的掉淚了，梨傑的親戚則拖着她，不肯放她走，最後是被人硬拖上了花轎，轎由兩匹白馬扛抬着，這時迎親的三數百騎則簇擁着新娘，凱旋似的飛奔着，一路呼叫着，從和碩到和靖，總有百把公里，下午四點鐘就到了王府。先是在這天上午十一時一刻，恭漢王由數十騎簇擁呼呌歸來，恭漢王戴着禮帽穿着長袍馬褂，雖則是文質彬彬；並不像一個草原上的少年英雄，但當他一馬當先進入王府精神抖擻，喜溢眉宇的時候，這位天山蒙古王子，看起來仍可以說是少年英俊的。這天島靜彬，西木珍和鳥靜彬的女兒曼琳，以及所有平常燙最時髦的髮式與穿最時髦的旗袍的蒙古婦女們都回復了他們的本來面目，照蒙古婦女式的打扮起來。洞房蒙古包佈置好了，新娘進門後所走的路也都由喇嘛劃好了，靄靄祥瑞的雲彩上還鋪着紅色的布條，一切都已經準備就緒。鳥靜是應該卯時上轎未時下轎的，但是一直等到下午四時，新娘才來，那時和靖全城早已懸旗一天了。我與帆羣兄很倉促的跳上馬跑到街頭，從街的南端，一直到王府，人馬已經擠的水洩不通，除迎親送親的人馬外，有騎着馬看的，有爬在樹上看的，還有站在屋頂上看的，都爭看這和靖的空前熱鬧，確實熱鬧極了。陽光正和煦的照耀着，在一片歡騰的氣氛裏，走向王府的首批是軍樂隊，接着是執旛傘的儀仗隊，接着是念經的喇嘛隊，最後才是幾百人馬擁行着的花轎，馬上的人無論男女都醉得東倒西歪，而且在呼呌着，歌唱着，花轎前面是方丈大的紅布喜帳，隨在喜帳後面的是送親的，幾位女人與招呼抬轎的兩個「東干」馬伕，行列幾乎是塞滿了和靖縣的唯一的一條正街。這時適有多少個窮，在好幾處牽繩子來擋駕，討喜錢，於是鈔票亂飛，這樣的紛亂和喧吵，總經過有半點多鐘才到王府，我們早已把馬丢開了，擠在人叢中，他攝取精彩的鏡頭，我搜索動人的材料，擠到王府已經是擠得一塌糊塗。在行過了很多蒙古禮節之後，新娘才走到那個蒙古包里，仍被那幅紅帳子遮掩着，新娘却已經等候多時了。</p>
<p>給我姆娜</p>
<p>在廳堂的兩側，擺了兩頂大蒙古包右邊的一頂擺滿了喇嘛教的神像，是「紙我姆娜」行禮的地方，左邊一頂新房，陳設及裝飾極為華麗！裏面還擺有兩個鐵床，新娘坐在左邊的鐵床，仍被那幅紅色帳子遮掩着，上面供的是觀音像，中間擺的是「泡子」和數神宴客的酒餚，上香，叩頭，唱讚美詩，除了在行禮的時候，還勸酒之外「給我姆娜」的秩序與漢族舊式結婚的禮節是大同小異的，總之蒙古包裏面是擠滿了人，直到深夜那頂新房里還在鬧嚷着，這也許就是蒙古人的「鬧房」吧！</p>
<p>二十六號的上午梨傑見公婆，在蒙古包里她向公婆敬酒敬飯，再又敬酒，每敬酒一次，大家就得歌唱一次，男女兩家的主人，還互相來敬酒敬飯，敬酒敬飯之後，還向滿漢王鳥靜彬西木珍鄭重的囑託一番，最後女家是吿辭了，女方的男女主人一個個又因而掉淚，這項禮行到下午一時半，這天下午並舉行了剪帳禮，拿走了遮住新娘的那一幅紅色喜帳，在蒙古包里面，全是蒙古人，行的蒙古禮，說的蒙古話，我懂得什麼呢？只記得當時恭漢王吿訴我的一句蒙古話：這就是蒙古人的「給我姆娜」你們所說的「結婚」。</p>
<h3 id="c75">南斯拉夫一根盲腸 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 珍君譯</p>
<p>狄托和史達林之間的罅隙，現在變得更為顯著。在南斯拉夫國內，一個擁護蘇聯軍官的慘遭殺害，已是常見的事。狄托對於蘇聯採取抗拒的態度，他要淸除國內的蘇聯應聲蟲尋求制裁蘇聯扈從的方法，讓大家都不大關心史達林這個人。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫在蘇維埃制度下之缺點和汚蹟已被充分暴露，引起人民對於莫斯科冷戰攻勢的憎惡，這顯然是獨裁者之間一個迅捷和具有實力的最後試探。</p>
<p>史達林現在對於美國和西歐聯盟的爭辯已經漸趨冷淡，他的注意力已轉向另一方面，那是因為他急補綴蘇維埃大帝國中可能是最弱的一環。這個，就是位於蘇聯西南部脅下，邱吉爾稱為：「歐洲柔軟下腹地帶」的南斯拉夫。當蘇聯發覺這一環的忠心，確實是値得懷疑的時候，他們可以採取任何方式，指揮陸軍進襲，或者運用空軍的力量，將南斯拉夫整個的加以摧毀。</p>
<p>直到今日為止，史達林企圖攫取南斯拉夫。</p>
<p>進入蘇聯系統的努力，已經宣吿失敗，阻撓和譴責，還有經過一個多月的公開揭露秘密，但都歸於無效。有件近於奇蹟的事實在共產黨人的圈子裏發生，那就是在歐洲大陸上的共產黨卽使企圖發動一個公開的抨擊。</p>
<p>和狄托在國會共爭議席使得他在南斯拉夫無法立足，或者強制他發表謝罪聲明，或者分散他的支持的活動，但都失敗。</p>
<p>獨裁者之間的角逐已經開始，史達林顯然是不能忍容叛逆和挑戰的行動的。這對於蘇聯的實力是可打擊，而且這個不安的毒素，還可能蔓延到東歐集團中的其他部份，給予西歐各國一個可以利用的機會，攻擊蘇聯陣營內這個意外的弱點。但是史達林顯然也會保持二國間種族上的和諧關係，同時通過表決的方式，採取一致行動，對抗西歐。然後西歐各國將被逐出伯爾格來德，那時候史達林將很容易的掉過頭來，對付崛強的狄托。</p>
<p>這一點是很重要的，史達林的試探行動，是要認識他和狄托之間的對立關係，以及南斯拉夫今日的內部實際情形，到底是怎麼一個樣子。</p>
<p>所有爭辯中心，最後將歸結到這個問題上來，誰是南斯拉夫的主人——史達林還是狄托？這個問題從來不曾在蘇聯的其他衛星國家內發生，以至變得這麼的嚴重尖銳化，但在南斯拉夫，自從大戰結束以後，這個討厭的問題可就日益擴大起來，每一次爭辯的延續，都顯示出那是應該歸咎於史達林委員長要陷　狄托。</p>
<p>早在戰爭期間，狄托就已犯下一個嚴重的「過失」，他對於遠由莫斯科派來，協助他擬五年計劃的設計人員的勸吿和助力，表示得異常冷淡，不予理會。狄托的理想，不但要起草這個偉大的計劃，還得鼓起全國人民的熱誠，共同參加這一個建國運動。於是莫斯科方面警吿，認為狄托的計劃太小孩氣，綱目也不夠明晰</p>
<p>，這是個不足重視的計劃，最後莫斯科控訴狄托不曾建立一個勞工本位的社會，然而那又是必要的。要是由共產黨人出面執政，那他們是能致力完成的。一個農業社會是要在堅定不移的領導中，才能漸趨佳境。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫的農民，還和從前一樣的距離蘇維埃集體農塲制度還很遙遠，克里姆宮的訓令，是要狄托淸算土豪，將他們所有土地轉移為國家公有的田莊，強迫全體</p>
<p>農民互助合作共同耕耘。智識份子也得離開伯爾格來德，深入農村，然而他並不曾這樣的實行。相反的狄托曾經答應南斯拉夫伯農民——佔全國人口的百分之八十——，他們可以各別的自由耕種，同時採用操縱農作物價格的手段使得他們的生活，能較優於工業區的生活水準，狄托還冒險的答應南斯拉夫的農民，他們將有私畜的自由，這些措施，都曾呌史達林大為惱怒，而無法寬恕的。</p>
<p>共產黨在南斯拉夫並不曾生靈活運動的效能，這也許就是使得史達林不樂意的因素之一，狄托堅持黨的組織應該保持民主作風，讓黨的界綫不大分明，共產黨和非共產黨都得以密切聯繫，和諧相處。狄托願淸除黨外份子，也不曾將共產國黨高高的放在國家第一位，或者讓全國工友們的薪資都獲得最滿意的報酬。黨員反對狄托的這種蠻幹作風，蔑視他們對於國家和時代的「偉大貢獻」，這樣使得他們在莫斯科有地位的朋友也為之大吃一驚。（未完）</p>

<p>— 楊光節譯</p>
<p>統治西南的回民代表是靑海的馬步芳將軍。記者曾以一日時間驅車至蘭州西方一百五十英里的西寗，在他的西式住宅中拜訪過他。當我們進入了靑海境後，我們見到靑海正努力推行好些公共工作。各處都種滿了樹苗，（據說五年後，靑海要造林六十萬株），公路已經修築好了，灌漑計劃正在草擬，增產木材辦法已經實施，好些地方都設有公共診療所，各地也成立了義務學校，它辦理的成績比中國其他更好。</p>
<p>記者是在早上七點鐘會見馬步芳將軍的，稀疏的鬍鬚，持起來，比他實際上似乎高大得多。他極端憎恨共產主義。</p>
<p>事實上，馬步芳將軍所統率的回教軍隊是願意打仗，而且打得很好的。記者曾在西寗附見看過他們的操練，確實比中國其他軍隊嚴格得多。不過馬祇有十萬軍隊，由於防綫太長，從迪化一直佈防到陜西前綫，所以防禦力也並不很強。最近在蘭州舉行西南各省首長會議時，馬便要求從各省撥補兵源給他。馬的軍隊重兵器很少，他們的武器由於供應困難，也不劃一。他又沒有兵工廠。最近，陳納德將軍民航隊開闢了迪化航綫，才空運了五十噸美國援華軍事物資給他。</p>
<p>另一個回教徒的軍事領袖是寗夏省的馬鴻逵，由於他所統治的地區更接近了中共地區，所以他對抵抗中共的侵略，却沒有靑海這樣樂觀。</p>
<p>離開寗夏五百英里的地方是四川的重慶，中國戰時首都，市長楊森是一個著名的軍事家，他宣稱中國人民是害怕共產主義的。</p>
<p>四川老百姓方面，往往需要兩至三日從各鄕担運稻米到田糧處繳納，不但路上的食用要自己出，而且田賦處的職員常常以他們的稻米太劣為藉口而拒收，而所繳納的稻米呢，却又常常被投機者拿來在市塲出賣。當收獲時候米價跌，靑黃不接時候米價漲。</p>
<p>不論和談的情形如何，這裏的士兵却很多，不論你在何時何地，都會碰到穿制服的人，在蘭州，是沒有關卡的，所以士兵們代替來檢查你的行李。在靑海甘肅邊界，也是由他們來負責盤查。在成都，這裏很少有苦力來替旅客來搬行李的，也由士兵來接替了這門工作。漢中，西安，四川的公路上，軍運頻繁，由於昆明附近時有匪警，一部份軍隊正調往警戒保護。</p>

<p>(1) The enemy's 29th Army, comprising the 86th and 87th divisions, and a portion of the 8th Police Brigade, with over 20 artillery pieces, launched a multi-pronged attack on our forces at 1:00 AM on the 13th. Our troops lured them into the Shizilin, Yuepu, and Yangxing areas, immediately launching a forceful encirclement. Heavy fighting ensued until 12:00 PM, resulting in severe enemy casualties, with corpses strewn across the fields. It is estimated that over 200 enemy troops were annihilated in the Wangbang area of Yuepu, over 300 near Shizilin, and over 500 near Yangxing. In total, over 1,000 enemy troops were killed, over 2,000 wounded, and one enemy platoon leader and over 50 soldiers were captured.

After the defending forces conducted separate interceptions, the battle was quite intense. By noon on the 13th, having achieved our delaying mission, we proactively withdrew to the second line of defense. Currently, our fresh, elite troops are steadily deploying to the front lines. If the enemy continues to attack, they will certainly be encircled and annihilated.</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Soviet Iron Curtain in the Far East; The Competition for Xinjiang's Provincial Affairs Is a Political Struggle Between China and the Soviet Union; The Soviet Union's Methods of Aggression Against Xinjiang May Differ, but Its Goal Remains Consistent <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[United States New Opening Office, New York, 11th dispatch] The Chinese-language program of the "Voice of America" radio station featured Guo Yunkui speaking on "The Soviet Iron Curtain in the Far East." Below is the fifth installment of his speech:</p>
<p>The political solution to the Kazakh rebellion in Xinjiang is an embarrassing result of the Soviet Union's two-faced policy towards China. Because the Chinese government was preoccupied with the communist party problems in North China and Central China, it decided to take a conciliatory attitude towards the Xinjiang rebels, asking the Soviet Consul-General in Dihua to mediate and seek compromise. After Sheng Shicai was removed from his post as Chairman of Xinjiang, Wu Zhongxin succeeded him. Then, Zhang Zhizhong was appointed by the central government. In order to achieve the goal of a political solution, Zhang was willing to make all possible concessions to the rebels, only seeking to ensure that China's sovereignty was maintained. At a conference in Dihua in 1947, Zhang Zhizhong declared that "the central government is willing to return all political power to the people of Xinjiang, but only asks that the nation's territory and sovereignty be preserved intact."</p>
<p>After seven months of negotiations and haggling between the Chinese government and the Yili rebels, an agreement was finally signed in January 1946. According to this agreement, the rebel army recognized China's suzerainty and the central government's right to send troops to protect Xinjiang's border security and prevent foreign aggression. The Chinese government, on the other hand, granted the rebel army a very high degree of autonomy, including the right to organize six regiments of officers and soldiers to maintain local security, and the right to elect all councilors of local councils in each administrative region, and to elect 15 of the 20 members of the Xinjiang Provincial Government.</p>
<p>According to Professor McLean's detailed account in his article "Xinjiang Today," the Chinese government was able to abide by the provisions of the agreement and held free elections at the end of 1946. Most of the elected representatives were local Uyghurs who were already working in the provincial government. However, the rebel army failed to fulfill its promises. To date, the Chinese government's troops have not been able to enter the three administrative regions of northern Xinjiang, which are still in the hands of the rebels and controlled by the Soviet Union. Zhang Zhizhong also reported that "According to the agreement, six regiments of troops could be stationed in the three administrative regions of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan, but these troops were not reorganized by the government as stipulated in the agreement."</p>
<p>Ahemaitijiang, the Vice Chairman of Xinjiang, was a key agent who had been trained in the Soviet Union and sent to Xinjiang to engage in activities. He and Kesimofu and Saber were all key figures in the pro-Soviet left wing, or rather the Yining Group organized by the Soviet Union. Xinjiang also had a right-wing pro-China Islamic Group, led by Masud, Burhan, and former Heshuite chieftain Amin, who were deeply shocked by the growing influence of the Soviet Union in the so-called "national liberation movement" in Central Asian Turkey.</p>
<p>When Zhang Zhizhong, the Chairman of Xinjiang Province, was transferred to the post of Northwest Administrative Officer in June 1947, and Masud, a central committee member for many years who came from a landlord and merchant family in Xinjiang, was appointed by the central government as the new Provincial Chairman, the Yining Group deliberately expressed dissatisfaction, rose up in opposition, and prepared to take action. According to a note in the article "The Straits of Xinjiang" in the December 1947 issue of "Pacific Affairs," this Yining Group, guided by the Soviet Union, protested against Masud's appointment, but was defeated by a small margin. Masud finally officially took office as the Chairman of Xinjiang in late June 1947, but then the political situation in Xinjiang began to shake again. In mid-July, a riot broke out in Turpan, southwest of Dihua. By August 26, the leaders of the Yining Group had withdrawn from Dihua. By the end of October, the Yining army seemed to threaten Dihua again. As Professor McLean pointed out, these traitors were once again preparing to try again, just like the attempt in the autumn of 1945.</p>
<p>The Soviet bosses behind the Yining rebels were not satisfied with this. Professor McLean clearly pointed out that under the pressure of Soviet-backed extremists, these local so-called "nationalists" who were instigated by the Soviet Union engaged in mostly anti-Chinese or anti-Han activities, with fiery speeches, collective strikes, and hostile demonstrations. Zhang Zhizhong, in his capacity as the Chairman of Xinjiang Province, toured southern Xinjiang in May 1947. His impressions were reported at a conference in Dihua attended by representatives of Yining, and were later published by the Xinjiang Daily on August 14, 1947, and reprinted by the Dagong Daily from August 25 to 30, 1947. He declared, "Regarding the situation in Shufu, I can say that the local atmosphere is now very unfriendly to the interests of our country and our national army. If this continues, all our efforts to implement the agreement and maintain the prestige of the provincial government will be destroyed. I hope that the Shufu authorities will no longer ignore the interests of the whole country based on the interests of one party and one faction." Professor McLean also specifically pointed out that the Soviet consulates often used sophisticated and modern propaganda techniques to support the Yining rebel group. The Yining Group, directed by the Soviet Union, had been mobilizing many primary school teachers, doctors, technicians, and people from the middle and lower classes of society in Xinjiang. Their propaganda particularly emphasized the "ethnic" and cultural relations between the Uyghurs of Xinjiang and the neighboring Soviet Socialist Republics.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong's main means of politically resolving the Xinjiang rebellion, which represented Soviet interests, was a conciliatory attitude. Zhang said, "Because Vice Chairman Ahemaitijiang and other Yining members of the provincial government formed only a minority, I could not hope to pass any proposals they put forward. Therefore, I never used my power to put their proposals to a vote. Whenever I encountered disagreements with the minority opinion, I always used negotiations and concessions as examples, so many that I could not list them all. As a result, outsiders mistakenly believed that I could not prevent the Yining Group from controlling everything in Xinjiang." But Zhang Zhizhong admitted in his speech the failure of his conciliatory attitude towards the Soviet-controlled Yining Group. He said, "Despite all the concessions and efforts I have made to seek cooperation in provincial affairs, the situation in Xinjiang has really transitioned from military conflict to political antagonism. In this sense, the illusion of a political solution has to be transformed into the reality of a political struggle."</p>
<p>The competition for Xinjiang's provincial affairs is a political struggle between China and the Soviet Union. Professor McLean pointed out that if there was no external interference, the right-wing pro-China Islamic Group might have prevailed over the left-wing pro-Soviet so-called nationalist group. But the future of Xinjiang depended on the comparison of the total pressure that the Chinese central government and the Soviet government could exert on the province. Professor McLean pointed out that the Yining Group, with the support of the Soviet Union, already had great influence in Xinjiang in terms of personnel administration and routine provincial affairs. This can be confirmed by Zhang Zhizhong's speech, in which he said that at the election of commissioners of various administrative regions held in 1947 according to the terms of the agreement, "The provincial government had already announced all the rules so that it could be implemented quickly, but Vice Chairman Ahemaitijiang and other Yining provincial committee members suggested delaying the process, because they knew that if the election was held at that time, their group would not be able to control it, and they would not be able to express any opinion if the administrative chiefs of various regions they did not like were re-elected." Zhang Zhizhong also made similar complaints, saying that the Yining Group prevented him from turning Xinjiang College into the national Tianshan University, the unified currency system, and the plan to extend the existing railway to Dihua. The Yining Group's tricks were clearly intended to sever Xinjiang from China, promote Soviet interests in Xinjiang, and prepare to drag Xinjiang behind our country's iron curtain again.</p>
<p>The political solution to the Xinjiang rebellion has completely failed. The so-called "East Turkestan Republic" under the wing of the Soviet Union still exists and is trying to expand. Professor McLean reported that the Yining rebel government had established a special administrative system, collecting taxes, publishing newspapers and propaganda, and training regular troops. Zhang Zhizhong admitted that even as early as January 1946, after the signing of the agreement, the three regions of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan "still maintain a special status. We deeply feel that if this special situation lasts for a long time, the disintegration of other ethnic groups will be even more likely." Professor McLean also emphasized this crisis, saying that the Soviet Union has economic and geographical advantages over China and can exert pressure on Xinjiang. "Unless the anti-Soviet forces within Xinjiang can receive external support, Xinjiang seems likely to be controlled by the Soviet Union again."</p>
<p>I have clearly analyzed in previous broadcasts that the Soviet Union's goal of aggression in Xinjiang has always been consistent, but the methods of aggression have varied from time to time. For example, Sheng Shicai's rule, the Kazakh rebellion, and the one-sided political solution were all just aspects of the Soviet Union's policy of aggression.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Legislative Yuan Passes Important Resolution; Supports Government's Continued War Effort; Levies US$1 Billion from Song, Kong, Zhang, and Jiaao <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th dispatch] The Legislative Yuan continued its 19th meeting on the afternoon of the 13th, chaired by Luo Heng, with 196 members in attendance. The meeting passed a "Resolution Supporting the Government's Continued War Against the Chinese Communists for Undermining Peace," as well as a "Resolution to Establish a Committee to Investigate the Yuan's Affairs" and a temporary motion to "Levy US$1 Billion from Mr. Song Ziwen, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, and Mr. Zhang Jiaao." The selection of the members of the Yuan Affairs Investigation Committee was extensively discussed at the meeting. Finally, a resolution was passed to have the chairman nominate 15 people, who would be approved by the assembly. The assembly also passed a resolution to hold a closed-door seminar on the morning of the 14th before adjourning. The assembly also passed a resolution to hold a closed-door seminar on the morning of the 14th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th dispatch] The Legislative Yuan passed the "Resolution Supporting the Government's Continued War Against the Chinese Communists for Undermining Peace" at its 19th meeting on the 13th. This case was submitted to the assembly for approval after being reviewed by 13 members, including Xu Yuanquan. The original text of the resolution is recorded as follows: "Since the beginning of this year, the government has followed public opinion, advocated peace, and exercised the utmost sincerity in tolerance, hoping to achieve a fair, reasonable, comprehensive, and lasting peace. The Yuan previously held a meeting in Nanjing, where it resolved to unanimously support the government's peace-seeking policy and called on the Chinese Communists to cease hostilities. Unexpectedly, during the peace talks, the Chinese Communists put forward their so-called eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the "Domestic Peace Agreement," setting a deadline for acceptance, and then launched an offensive, crossed the Yangtze River, expanded the war, and massacred the people. The responsibility for undermining peace should be borne by the Chinese Communists. The facts are all there and are obvious to all the people. Based on past experience, the members of this Yuan deeply understand that the Chinese Communists' attempt is to subvert the country and enslave the people. To reiterate: (1) The war launched by the Chinese Communists is an international war of aggression, not a simple domestic war; (2) The Chinese Communists are fighting against all the freedom-loving people. This war is not a war between parties, but a war between good people and violence; (3) The Chinese Communists are seizing power by violence, and their purpose is to destroy democracy and implement totalitarian politics; (4) Under the control of the Chinese Communists, not only is the people's life and property not guaranteed, but families are broken up, ethics are disrupted, and the people have no possibility of living freely. Our people across the country, in order to fight for survival, for freedom, for human justice, to defend our homes, and to maintain national independence, should rise up in unison, support the government in strengthening the anti-communist front, and fight to the end until the Chinese Communists abandon their dream of conquering by force and achieve final victory."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th dispatch] During the 19th meeting on the afternoon of the 13th, the Legislative Yuan passed a temporary emergency motion by 49 members to levy US$1 billion from Mr. Song Ziwen, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, and Mr. Zhang Jiaao in order to save the crisis and quell the communist rebellion. The original text of the motion stated: "The Communist Party is ruining the country and undermining peace. The government has moved south, and the military situation is becoming increasingly urgent. Therefore, the national crisis is serious and has reached a stage that brooks no delay. All compatriots should contribute money and strength in order to jointly overcome the crisis. At this critical juncture, "taxation" and "waiting for aid" are not allowed by time. Therefore, it is proposed to levy a total of US$1 billion from Mr. Song Ziwen, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, and Mr. Zhang Jiaao, with half of it used for military expenses and half as a fund for reorganizing finance, in order to save the crisis and quell the communist rebellion. After the recovery of the national territory, the national treasury will repay the full amount. Is this appropriate? Please decide." When this temporary emergency motion was put forward, it was met with warm applause from all the members present, expressing their support, and was subsequently passed without objection.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 12th] The central agencies stationed in Xinjiang have been experiencing extreme difficulties in maintaining operations due to the recent interruption of supplies. They previously jointly borrowed money from the provincial government to overcome the current difficulties. The Xinjiang Provincial Government today passed a resolution in a meeting to temporarily loan money to maintain the central agencies. Institutions with their own income, such as the Telecommunications Bureau and the Postal Bureau, are allowed to borrow five yuan in currency per employee and one yuan and five jiao per worker. Institutions without their own income, such as the Diplomatic Office and the Supervisory Office, in addition to borrowing cash, are also allowed to borrow 55 jin of flour per person, starting from May. In addition, the gold yuan notes allocated by the central government for the salaries of the national army stationed in Xinjiang will be handed over to the Lanzhou Office of the Xinjiang Commercial Bank to purchase materials and transport them to Dihua.

<h3 id="e16">US Orders Stop to Dismantling of Japanese War Industries; Our Restitution Work Not Affected <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Reparations from Japan to the Allied countries are about to be stopped according to the policy of the United States. The reparations that Japan has paid so far are only worth more than 23.9 million US dollars, which is far from what was suggested by the most generous Johnston Report and the moderate Strack Report. The US side's previous suggestions on the amount of Japanese reparations are as follows: In April 1947, the Joint Army-Navy Committee roughly based on the figures suggested in the Pauley Report, which was 616,448,000 US dollars. In February 1948, Strack suggested 412,040,000 US dollars. In April 1948, the Johnston Report suggested 165,561,850 US dollars. Our Reparations Delegation to Japan issued a statement this morning stating that only a portion of the equipment of the army and navy arsenals belonging to the Japanese government has been dismantled and shipped as reparations, while other private war industries have remained untouched.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Since the news that the United States has decided to stop all reparations work in Japan was released, the stock market here has had a violent reaction this morning. The stocks of major Japanese military factories and heavy industries have all soared in unison.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] After the news that the US government ordered the cessation of dismantling Japanese war industries as reparations, Tokyo was filled with optimism. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida happily declared at a press conference this afternoon that Japan's international status has gradually improved, and the US decision to stop Japanese reparations is a clear proof of this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] If the US order to stop dismantling Japanese war industries as reparations becomes the final reparations policy of the Far Eastern Commission, then the work of Japan's reparations to the Allied countries will be declared over in early November of this year. There is no doubt that this US order will affect any decisions of the Far Eastern Commission on Japanese reparations. When the reporter asked Wu Bannong, the head of our Reparations Delegation to Japan, whether this decision by the United States would affect our country's restitution work in Japan, Wu replied: Reparations and restitution are two completely different things, so the restitution work should not be affected by this. Wu said: The restitution work is scheduled to end in March next year.</p>

<p>In the past few days, Shanghai's public and private schools at all levels, hoping that the military would not be stationed in the schools, or to avoid the school buildings being used as wounded soldier hospitals. The principals have jointly requested the Director of Education to protect education and protect the next generation. The principals are usually troubled by the rice, oil, firewood, and vegetables of the teachers and students, and cannot break through a bright path. Recently, they have been running around for the school buildings. They are sweating profusely, full of worry and anxiety, entrusting people with favors and saying good words everywhere, hoping to preserve the schools and keep the sound of strings uninterrupted, but they still inevitably encounter closed doors and are rebuffed. Their good intentions are truly worthy of our infinite sympathy.</p>
<p>In the past, because the social organization was not sound, the people's vision was too short-sighted, the soldiers' knowledge was not very high, the school's responsibilities were not fully fulfilled, the military and education were disconnected, the military and the schools were alienated, and they were following the path of "emphasizing generals in wartime and emphasizing ministers in peacetime", which invisibly created the outdated concept of "education is the least important". Some people even say that Shanghai currently only needs the Bureau of Social Affairs to stabilize the interior and the Police Bureau to resist foreign enemies, and other bureaus seem to be superfluous. In fact, they did not think that society is a whole organic body, and the Police Bureau and the Bureau of Social Affairs are like a person's hands and feet, and if the hands and feet are sound, but the brain, stomach, and blood vessels are weak, how can the hands and feet be strong alone, not to mention that the actions of the hands and feet all depend on the command of the brain, the nourishment of the stomach, and the circulation of the blood vessels. Education is like the brain of people. Therefore, President Chiang Kai-shek said during the War of Resistance against Japan: There are three elements of national construction: first, education, second, military force, and third, economy. And education is the general hub of military force and economy. Because both military force and economy must be produced and nourished by education to complete their missions. No wonder civilized countries must attend the last class in the midst of gunfire before they are willing to stop.</p>
<p>In the past, the educational administrative authorities had very little contact and very little relationship with the military and schools, military affairs and education, and had no policy and no plan. Even if there were policies and plans, they often did not work. As a result, they often embrace Buddha's feet when things come to a head, treat the head when it hurts, and the head still hurts, treat the feet when they hurt, and the feet are difficult to heal. In the end, they are often at a loss and end up doing nothing. On the surface, it seems that the schools are suffering and the students are suffering; however, when settling accounts, to put it mildly, this debt must also be written in the record of the victory or defeat of the war. To put it mildly, the nation-state suffers hidden losses.</p>
<p>Sun Tzu's Art of War says, "To subdue the enemy's army without fighting is the best of all." For the military unit, they are still reluctant to break it, for the education that is tied to the lifeblood of the nation, if it can be preserved, why not preserve it. Sun Tzu's Art of War begins by saying: "Therefore, measure it by five things, and calculate it to find out its situation: one is the Way, two is the Sky, three is the Earth, four is the General, and five is the Law." He puts the "Way" first, he says, "The Way is to make the people agree with the ruler, so that they can die with him, live with him, and not fear danger." The "Way" is not an empty thing, it represents the relationship between the government and the people, and it is a tool to win the masses. Sun Tzu divides war into four levels, the first level of war is "attacking the enemy's plans," the second level is "attacking the enemy's alliances," the third level is "attacking the enemy's army," and the fourth level is "attacking the enemy's cities," and he considers "attacking the enemy's plans" to be the best strategy. "Attacking the enemy's plans" is to attack the heart, that is, modern political warfare, psychological warfare, and cold war. If used well, it can create a victory of "no wisdom and no courage." This kind of bloodless war is the most economical, but the most important thing is the "Way." This word "Way" is the only weapon to win the hearts of the people and the only capital to win victory. The people need education, and the government gives them education. This is "knowing what to give and taking, the reality of politics." This can "make the people agree with the ruler." This can win without fighting. At least be victorious in every battle when "attacking the enemy's army" and "attacking the enemy's cities."</p>
<p>There are more disadvantages than advantages to the military living in the city. When Zeng Guofan trained the Xiang Army, he established a simple standard in terms of quality. Don't use wandering soldiers and slippery soldiers. He said in his memorial that only those who choose "villagers who are strong, simple, and honest, training one person will gain the benefit of one person, and training one day will have the effect of one day." To Peng Xiaofang, Zeng Xianghai wrote: "Do not take those who are flashy, but seek those who are of the working class." This means that farmers from rural areas, who have preserved their inherent honesty and courage, and have not been contaminated with flashy habits, are more likely to be effective.</p>
<p>Wounded soldier hospitals should be prepared as soon as possible, but before the wounded soldiers arrive, it is still advisable to leave space so that the original institutions can preserve their original work and do not have to occupy them all or use them for other purposes. It is said that 10,000 wounded soldier beds are needed now. The ten dance halls that have been prepared have about 3,000 beds, and the remaining 7,000 beds are only thinking about schools. In fact, there is no need to do this. Shanghai has plenty of entertainment venues and high-rise buildings. Why must we requisition schools and make millions of students drop out of school!</p>
<p>We must know that today, the schools in Shanghai have one school building used for several schools. Some have been used for six or seven schools. They lend classrooms to schools in the suburbs, and they also lend them to teachers and students of evacuated schools as a place to live. They also lend out instruments and books, and the corridors are full of refugee children. Their own students are divided into two sessions, morning and afternoon, to teach classes. If the military is stationed again, or it is converted into a wounded soldier hospital, the number of displaced schools is more than just one or two, and they are scattered throughout society. The impact is conceivable. We sincerely hope that the military authorities can still protect the next generation in the Taoist war!</p>
<h3 id="e22">Artificial Lightning in Dense Fog—Safely Guiding Airplanes to Land <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Specially Translated by the Guangzhou US Information Office)</p>
<p>Dazzling artificial lightning has recently been guiding airplanes to land safely in airports shrouded in dense fog in the United States. A row of light emitters, the size of cigarette boxes, near the Landing Aids Experimental Station in Arcata, California, emit lightning-like flashes that penetrate the extremely dense fog to guide airplanes to land on the runway. Soon, they will help large numbers of scheduled flights land at New York International Airport.</p>
<p>This new type of illuminant is important news in itself. However, there is a dramatic story behind its invention, which is particularly dramatic for the experimenter.</p>
<p>During the recent war, Ben Lahr, a Westinghouse researcher in Cleveland (in Ohio), spent much of his normal working time researching better new searchlights for the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>As his beam experiment work progressed, he fantasized about the problem of light penetration through dense fog. When he had time, he worked with paper, pen, and slide rule. As a result, he came up with some mathematical answers to the problem.</p>
<p>Later, Lahr discovered his lightning source in a special "super light," which was invented by Westinghouse research engineers during the war for nighttime aerial photography. The lamp has a slender quartz tube filled with krypton, one of the naturally rare gases.</p>
<p>When a strong current of high-voltage electricity is emitted through the gas from a small artificial lightning engine, the lamp emits a dazzling flash. It has 900 candlepower per square inch, nine times stronger than sunlight. The lamp can indeed emit a flash that lasts 17 one-hundredths of a second, or about one-tenth of the emission time of natural lightning.</p>
<p>Lahr was convinced that the krypton lamp's flash could penetrate the densest fog. His next problem was to find out what effect this powerful flash would have on pilots' eyes.</p>
<p>He solved that problem in his two-car garage behind his house. He installed various flashes there, as well as various optical testing instruments and sensory recording equipment. In order to find experimental subjects, he invited his family and many friends, and gathered many young people from the neighborhood to visit his flashes. Local teenagers gave up their games to visit. Lahr slowly increased the intensity of the flashes until the children's eyes could not be opened.</p>
<p>While working with home equipment in his backyard laboratory, he discovered that when the eyes adapt to darkness—such as aviators flying at night—the retina is not affected by any changes in luminosity lasting less than one-thousandth of a second. From these experiments in the home laboratory, a mixed illuminator of krypton lamps and neon lamps was produced, which is the new type of light emitter of the Westinghouse Corporation.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a U.S. Air Force C-45 transport aircraft experienced engine failure over Cleveland. When the pilot communicated with the local airport by radio, he received the shocking news that the aircraft's height near the ground was limited to 300 feet. However, he decided to try to land. After three attempts to find the airport failed, as the airport personnel deployed the airport's instrument landing equipment and Westinghouse's experimental lightning, the pilot almost turned around, risking finding better weather. When the pilot tried to land again, he followed the signals of the instrument landing equipment and saw six dazzling flashes of light facing the airport. When the plane carrying seven airmen and 32 passengers safely reached the ground, the pilot told ground observers that he "could not have landed" without Lahr's artificial lightning.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Taiwan Province Implements 37.5% Rent Reduction <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Taipei News] Although Chen Cheng has been in Taiwan as chairman for less than six months, his blueprint for governing this beautiful island is the most far-reaching and ideal. He first put forward the clear banner of "People First" and "People's Livelihood First", everything for the people, everything for the people. At the same time, in his think tank, he accommodated many experts who were familiar with and studied British politics, and wanted to transplant the socialist policies of the British Labor Party government to this treasure island along the center-left line, to do a good job, to thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and to teach the 6.5 million people of Taiwan to grow up rich and happy.</p>
<p>Therefore, this year's major work in Taiwan is to promote the "37.5%" rent reduction movement, which is the initial work of implementing land reform. Chairman Chen Cheng has the greatest determination to promote the "37.5%" rent reduction, which is also the public opinion of the people of the province, and actively and thoroughly promotes it. April was for preparatory work, and May further lectured and cultivated a large number of cadres for promotion, so that every village in the province could understand the main points of the "37.5%" rent reduction: by June, all will be mobilized to sign lease contracts separately. There are 6,302 villages (li) in the province, and 15,000 people will be mobilized to promote this great work. At the same time, the provincial 37.5% rent reduction supervision committee will also be established, giving Taiwan an optimistic future.</p>
<p>Of the 6.5 million people in Taiwan Province, tenant farmers account for 2.6 million. In the past, landlords charged rents of up to 55% to 75%, and tenant farmers were really overburdened and exploited, and could not get enough to eat. Based on this fact and in response to the current needs, the Taiwan Provincial Government has prepared a method to make up for the past shortcomings, eliminate disputes between landlords and tenant farmers, and strive for future cooperation between landlords and tenant farmers. This method is very simple: (1) According to the regulations of the Executive Yuan, the rent should not exceed 37.5% of the total annual harvest of the main products. If the agreed rent exceeds 37.5%, it should be based on the agreement if it is less than 37.5%; (2) When the lessor recovers the leased land for self-cultivation in accordance with the law, the total area per household is limited; (3) The land tax and other donations paid by the landlord after the rent reduction are also reduced accordingly; (4) The land rent that was not measured last year should also be reduced in accordance with the "37.5%" rent reduction.</p>
<p>Now, all counties and cities in Taiwan are working hard to handle this work, and they have been supported by the farmers. Although the ignorant landlords have given resistance to the government's promotion of this great work, it is not great, especially in Pingtung in the south, the preparatory work for this "357" rent reduction has been done the most perfectly and well. Because the "37.5%" rent reduction work is not only beneficial to tenant farmers, but also provides security for landlords. Taiwan will smoothly complete this work of stabilizing people's livelihood and prospering society, and is now moving towards the bright and ideal road.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Harmonizing Opinions on the German Question: Three Powers to Convene Meeting; Jessup and Bohlen Depart for Paris; Denying US Plan to Withdraw Occupation Troops from German Territory <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 13th (Broadcast): Paris reports that upon arriving in Paris, US Ambassador-at-Large Jessup stated that the rumor concerning the US proposal to withdraw occupation troops from Germany "is inaccurate and easily leads to misunderstanding."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] US Ambassador-at-Large Jessup and State Department German affairs expert Bohlen departed Washington by plane last night for Paris to hold a preparatory meeting with representatives from the UK and France prior to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. They were accompanied by two State Department German affairs experts.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th] "The New York Times" reported today that State Department Director of Long-Range Planning, Mr. Rynin, will propose at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference that the four countries' occupation troops be withdrawn and concentrated in three German ports. US troops would concentrate in Bremen, British troops in Hamburg, Soviet troops in Stettin, and French troops would be stationed in Strasbourg, within French territory. This matter has been confirmed by authoritative sources here. However, reports claiming that the four countries have already reached an agreement on this matter are inaccurate. Both the US and Soviet sides are unwilling to express their attitudes towards this proposal. The French Embassy in the US stated that as of noon today, they had not been informed of this news. US authoritative sources emphasized to our correspondent that this plan does indeed exist, but it is "merely a plan," and the reaction of France will be considered first. The same source also stated that the reaction or exploitation of this proposal by the French Communist Party will also be considered in advance, but if the Soviet Union agrees to this measure, the Communist Party will not likely express opposition. It is believed here that Jessup and State Department advisor Bohlen will discuss this matter.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] The French Foreign Ministry stated tonight that it had not been informed of the proposal to concentrate occupation troops in three German ports and withdraw French troops to Strasbourg.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] It is said that the Western three powers are studying the issue of withdrawing occupation troops from various countries in Germany to German ports. British official sources were greatly surprised upon hearing this. Sources said that this move may have been proposed by a certain official in the US State Department, but it was stated with great certainty that the UK had never received this notification.</p>
<h3 id="e25">US, UK, and France Approve New West German Constitution with Reservations; Political Affairs Temporarily Handled by Premiers of Eleven States <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, 12th] The Commanders-in-Chief of the US, UK, and French occupation forces today, in their capacity as military governors, approved the constitution passed by the Bonn Constitutional Assembly for the establishment of a West German government. It is generally believed that their taking this action within 24 hours of the lifting of the Berlin Blockade is a reaffirmation of the Allied determination to organize a West German government until a peace treaty is signed or until the Soviet side expresses its willingness to cooperate before a treaty is signed.</p>
<p>The Allied Commanders did not change the wording of the constitution, but made six reservations. The Allied Commanders also congratulated the Bonn Constitutional Assembly for completing this difficult task satisfactorily in difficult circumstances. Now that the constitution has been approved by the Allies, Germans will gradually hold elections, perhaps in mid-July, so that there will be a government outside of the two houses of parliament, with a president and a prime minister each. The Allied Commanders made the following reservations regarding the constitution: (1) To notify the Germans not to forget that both administrative and legislative powers are subject to the orders of the Allied occupation forces. (2) The federal government's power to requisition police from the West German states is limited to cases where special approval is obtained from the Allied authorities. (3) Not detailed. (4) The special power to change the borders of West Germany cannot be exercised until a peace treaty is signed. (5) To clarify that certain legislative powers granted by the German states to the federal government are subject to careful review by the Allies. (6) To cautiously limit the federal government's power to take over power from the states in order to achieve economic equality. The Allied Commanders neither approved nor rejected the Bonn Constitutional Assembly's plan to establish an eighteen-member "Executive Committee" to carry out government work pending the official establishment of the West German government. US Military Governor Clay said that this issue would be left to the administrative chiefs of the eleven states in the West German occupation zone.</p>
<p>The Location of the Capital Will Be Reconsidered</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 12th] Well-informed sources say that the heads of the occupation forces advocate adding Berlin to the Federal Republic of West Germany, making it the twelfth state, and will ask the chairmen of the local councils to be responsible for handling future political affairs until the West German government is established. Regarding the location of the government, the heads of the occupation forces also believe that it is inappropriate and require the representatives to reconsider their decision.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 12th] Representatives of the West German Constitutional Assembly spoke today at a gathering of 300,000 Germans in the American sector of Berlin, expressing concern that the entire Germany might be "Bolshevized" after the merger of the East and West zones of Germany. The leader of the Social Democratic Party group in the West German parliament, 計密, will say that the current situation in the East zone and Berlin allows evil forces to enter West Germany freely. Bonn Constitutional Assembly Chairman Adenauer continued by saying that Berlin has become an outpost against the East, and the German people should not be overly optimistic or too pessimistic about the future. Christian Democratic Party's Kaiser declared that the majority of the motherland is still shrouded in darkness today, and said that the West German people have not forgotten their compatriots in the Soviet zone. Berlin Social Democratic Party leader Norman finally said that Germans are unwilling to be obedient. He vehemently criticized the Socialist Unity Party in the East German zone, saying that Hitler must have left behind some political methods in the presidential palace, which were being used by the Socialist Unity Party. He demanded that Eastern politicians withdraw from Berlin, "because their behavior is a work of sin from Hitler's regime."</p>

<p>[United Press, Berlin, 12th] In the British sector of Berlin, eleven people were arrested on the 12th for distributing newspapers registered with the Soviet side. According to the Soviet-controlled ADN news agency, they were also beaten. This is the first major trouble since the lifting of the blockade. ADN news agency first disclosed this matter, and West zone police officers confirmed it but denied that those arrested had been beaten. During the Berlin Blockade, the Soviet Union banned the distribution of publications registered with the Allies in the Soviet zone, and the Allies retaliated with a similar ban. However, since the lifting of the blockade, the Soviet side has lifted this order, followed by the US, but the UK and France have not taken this action.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th] President Truman declared today while receiving reporters that the lifting of the Berlin Blockade is a welcome event in the world situation, and he is extremely satisfied with it. The President continued by saying that he absolutely supports Secretary of State Acheson's statement yesterday on the policy towards Spain. Regarding US domestic issues, Truman said that he still advocates completely and strictly abolishing the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, regardless of whether the labor unions are prepared to accept a slightly modified law. The President denied rumors that he had hinted at wanting to "purge" members of Congress within the Democratic Party who oppose his economic and social policies.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 12th] Since the lifting of the Berlin Blockade, up to this morning, a total of 1,500 trucks and other motor vehicles have arrived in Berlin from West Germany, while only about 150 vehicles have arrived in Berlin from East Germany. Items transported from West Germany to Berlin by truck included vegetables and chemical products. Today, many street vendors were selling new potatoes, which could be purchased without ration coupons. According to well-informed sources, the British military government intends to ask the Soviet Union to allow an increase in the number of trains traveling between Berlin and West Germany. Currently, there are 16 trains running daily, including 3 military trains. The only incident that has occurred since the trains have been running is that the German Economic Commission in the Soviet zone did not allow the first mail train to Hanover to reach the Soviet zone, and the West zone municipal government has protested. No cargo ships from the West zone have arrived in Berlin yet. 2,000 cargo ships carrying a total of 92,000 tons of goods are waiting in Hamburg, ready to set sail for Berlin.</p>

<h3 id="e33">British House of Commons Approves Atlantic Treaty by a Large Majority; Bevin Explains That the Treaty Is Purely Defensive <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] The British House of Commons today approved the Atlantic Treaty by an overwhelming majority of 333 votes to 6. The opponents were two Communist Party members, two Independent Labour Party members, and two left-leaning Labour Party members. Another six Labour Party members abstained voluntarily. Foreign Secretary Bevin, in opening the debate in the House of Commons today, said that he believed the House of Commons, the entire British nation, and all peace-loving people in the world would accept the Atlantic Treaty. Bevin said, "Although the United Nations has been established, and peace treaties with Italy and Eastern European countries have been signed, we are still facing a group of Eastern European countries today. This group is the first deliberate action to create a division in Europe." Referring to the lifting of the Berlin Blockade, Bevin said, "The blockade will be lifted today. I firmly believe that the close unity of the countries of the Atlantic Treaty has made the Soviet Union reconsider its actions towards Berlin. The Soviet Union's policy is to call for peace while accusing others of inciting war, but at the same time, it creates unease in various countries. In view of this situation, we have no choice but to believe that all people who share the same will and are seen as targets for destruction should unite, not to attempt to attack but only to defend. The Soviet Union's totalitarian methods have enabled peace-loving people to gain a greater understanding and unite more closely." Referring to the Atlantic Treaty, Bevin said that if the government did not take measures to ensure its defense, it would not be fulfilling its responsibility to the country and the world. He said that some people attacked this treaty as an aggressive weapon, but if this treaty had been established in 1914 and 1939, both past world wars could have been avoided. "I want to emphasize that the true purpose of the treaty is defense. We want to ensure that the situation between 1930 and 1941 does not happen again." In conclusion, Bevin said, "The North Atlantic Treaty is a measure for collective defense between several countries. I firmly believe that we have taken the greatest step towards peace. We will be defenders of peace and firmly oppose aggressors. We will gather all resources to raise the living standards of people around the world." After Bevin's speech, Conservative Party leader Churchill rose and said that he agreed with the Foreign Secretary's speech. He continued, "I am pleased that the Foreign Secretary does not regard the lifting of the Berlin Blockade as a major peace move." Churchill said that the opposition party also contributed to the Atlantic Treaty, and said, "We express our praise for the great task undertaken by the United States, as the United States is the main contributor to the creation of the Atlantic Treaty." Churchill continued by saying that the combined forces of the Atlantic Treaty, the Brussels Pact, and the European Parliament are the most solid guarantee for peace and security. Referring to the Spanish question, Churchill said that he believed that Spain's failure to participate in the Atlantic Treaty was a gap in Western European strategy. He said that he was pleased that the Foreign Secretary agreed to restore diplomatic relations with Spain. "At the moment, all I ask for is this point. I think it is better to send an ambassador openly than to adopt a 'black market' style of diplomacy."</p>

<h3 id="e36">Political Committee Debates Italian Colonies Issue; Soviet and Indian Proposals Rejected; Arab Countries Blame UK for Disregarding Indigenous Interests <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 13th (Broadcast): Lake Success reports that the UN Political Committee rejected the Soviet plan to resolve the three former Italian colonies by an overwhelming majority. The plan advocated granting Libya and Eritrea independence within five years, Somalia should be granted independence within ten years, and at the same time, the three places should be managed by administrators appointed by the UN Trusteeship Council, and certain areas should be designated as strategic areas and placed under the jurisdiction of the Assembly. The case was rejected due to the vigorous opposition of Western countries. Subsequently, the Political Committee also voted to reject the Indian proposal advocating joint collective trusteeship.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 13th] The United Nations Political Committee completed its debate on the disposition of the former Italian colonies early in the morning of the 13th, and will reconvene at 10:30 a.m. to vote on whether to submit the Bevin-Sforza proposal to the United Nations General Assembly. The 59-nation Political Committee has been debating the issue for five weeks. The main proposal in the committee is the one proposed by the UK and supported by Western countries, the principle of which was agreed upon in London at the end of last week by British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Italian Foreign Minister Sforza. This plan is strongly opposed by the Soviet, Asian, and Arab groups. The plan would divide Libya among the UK, France, and Italy, and allow it to become independent within ten years. It would return Somalia to Italy and divide Eritrea between Abyssinia and British-Egyptian Sudan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 13th] During last night's meeting of the Political Committee, representatives from the Philippines, Burma, Haiti, Poland, and the Soviet Union accused Bevin and Sforza of the agreement they reached on the disposition of the former Italian colonies, believing that this move was a "political conspiracy that did not respect the opinions of the indigenous people of the various colonies and disregarded the United Nations." The debate continued until 12:30 a.m., and will reconvene this morning to vote. Some people believe that this issue will continue to be debated in the General Assembly plenary session.</p>
<p>Arab Countries' Representatives Support Polish Proposal</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 13th] The United Nations Political Committee today passed Poland's proposal with 23 votes to 15 and 17 abstentions, asking the United Nations to reconsider the fate of the indigenous people in the former Italian colonies, especially the Bevin-Sforza plan. The plan was advocated for adoption by the Political Committee on Wednesday. Today, representatives from the Arab countries all voted in favor of Poland's motion. Countries such as China, France, and the UK voted against it. The United States, most Latin American countries, and Israel, which voted for the first time in the United Nations today, all abstained. Before submitting its motion, the Polish representative spoke out against negotiating prices outside the United Nations regardless of the interests of the indigenous people.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Although the Berlin Blockade Has Been Lifted, British and American Air Lifts Continue; Clay Encourages Germans to Strive for Freedom <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 12th] Although the Berlin Blockade has been lifted, Allied authorities and Germans are still watching the Russians with suspicion. The airlifts are still continuing, and their meaning is a warning that Western countries are prepared for a possible new war in the Cold War. Within hours of the lifting of the blockade, the Soviet Union launched a rather strong propaganda campaign to participate in the control of the Ruhr industrial zone.</p>
<p>It has been disclosed that the UK and the US have decided to continue the airlifts until Berlin has stored 200,000 tons of food, in order to prevent any Soviet trickery. In the 24 hours up to noon on the 12th, Allied aircraft flew a total of 1,008 sorties, delivering a total of 9,047 tons of supplies to Berlin.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 12th] Outgoing US Military Governor for Germany Clay told Berlin citizens today, who were joyfully celebrating the lifting of the blockade, that they had gained freedom and should unite with the German territory occupied by the Soviet Union to defend their freedom. Clay was giving a farewell speech at a special meeting of the Berlin West zone City Council, saying that he, like the Germans, eagerly hoped for the unification of Germany. The audience cheered thunderously upon hearing this. But Clay also warned, "But unification must never be achieved at the expense of the freedom guaranteed by the new Bonn Constitution." The Bonn Constitution was drafted by West German political leaders as the basis for a permanent West German government. The Germans in the Soviet occupation zone did not participate. Clay further said that the end of the blockade means more than just the fact that trains and trucks are running again. The people of Berlin have acquired the right to freedom, which will be accepted by freedom-loving people everywhere. The British and French military governors will all agree with us that, like you, we want to see a unified Germany, but the arrival of unification must never sacrifice the freedom guaranteed by the constitution that has just been passed in Bonn. The citizens of Berlin who chose freedom and are prepared to accept sacrifices to protect freedom, along with the pilots of the British and American airlifts, are the "true heroes of the blockade."</p>
<h3 id="e38">US Orders MacArthur to Cancel Japanese Reparations; China, Philippines, and Other Countries Unanimously Oppose; US and China May Use Veto Power in Far Eastern Commission <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 12th] The United States today abruptly ordered MacArthur to cease the transfer of Japanese machine tools and other industrial equipment to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as a new step toward restoring Japan's self-sufficiency. Simultaneously, US representative McCoy clearly announced to the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission that the United States would oppose any proposal to resume reparations payments and could use its veto power in the commission to block such a vote.</p>
<p>Japan needs all its resources to reduce its dependence on US aid. Japan and the US can no longer wait for Pacific nations to decide how much Japan can pay in reparations and how it should be distributed. Since MacArthur began pre-delivery of Japanese reparations goods in April 1947, approximately 20,000 machine tools dismantled from Japanese military factories have been transferred to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Japan has also paid substantial reparations from its seized overseas assets, estimated by other officials to be no less than $3 billion. The Soviet Union obtained the most when the Red Army occupied Northeast China. Various countries have demanded tens of billions in reparations from Japan. The Philippines demands 15% of the total reparations, China demands 40%, Australia 28%, the United Kingdom 25%, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, and France 12% each, India 12.5%, New Zealand 2%, and Canada 11.5%. The US originally requested 29% but voluntarily relinquished it to be distributed among other countries and repeatedly urged all countries to reach an agreement as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 13th] MacArthur today declined to immediately comment on the US order to halt the shipment of Japanese reparations materials. While this unexpected move was welcomed by the Japanese, it has aroused opposition from spokespersons in China and the Philippines. According to a Chinese spokesperson, Japanese industries with war potential have not yet been touched. The US action on provisional reparations will likely clarify the entire reparations issue, which remains one of the major problems that the Allied nations must resolve.</p>
<p>US Suddenly Halts Japanese Reparations; Romulo Expresses Surprise</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 13th] Carlos Romulo, head of the Philippine delegation to the United Nations, declared on the 12th that the US decision to halt the dismantling of Japanese factories for reparations was surprising. Four weeks ago, the Philippine government issued a statement to the Far Eastern Commission in Washington, requesting the US to determine Japan's reparations policy. He is now baffled by General McCoy's statement and is awaiting instructions from the government.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 13th] Emilo Abello, head of the Philippine mission to Japan, declared today that the US policy of halting Japan's continued transfer of reparations materials seemed paradoxical. In his personal opinion, the Japanese economy cannot bear the burden of idle factories. It is already teetering due to the heavy burden of economic subsidies and the scarcity of raw materials. While idle factories could be used by countries ravaged during the war, they cannot aid the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>UK Did Not Agree to Cancel Japanese Reparations</p>
<p>But Has No Means to Act Against US Decision</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] After news of the US decision to halt the acquisition of reparations materials from Japan reached London, the reaction here was quite cool. A Foreign Office spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. The decision was announced by US Major General McCoy, representative to the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission. It is said that the UK received brief notification beforehand. Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the UK had not agreed to cancel Japan's reparations. However, it was also pointed out that because the US Treasury bears the full cost of the occupation of Japan, the UK is not in a position to insist that Japan continue to pay reparations. In matters concerning Japan, the UK government's decision-making power differs from its decision-making power in matters concerning Germany. Therefore, if the US government ultimately decides to cancel Japan's reparations, the UK has no choice but to accept the decision. Observers also pointed out that the US abolition of the Far Eastern Commission's reparations plan could have two possible consequences: First, the Allied nations in the Far East will not receive reparations; second, the US policy of reviving the Japanese economy may neglect security considerations.</p>
<p>Full Text of US Statement</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 12th] The United States will no longer exercise the right to issue directives to continue authorizing the removal of equipment from Japan as reparations. US Major General McCoy, representative to the Far Eastern Commission, declared in a statement issued by the State Department today: "Japan's economic situation has developed to such an extent that if Japan is to achieve any degree of recovery, no more industrial equipment can be removed." McCoy said that this fact, coupled with the failure to resolve the reparations issue despite continuous US efforts, has prompted the US government to rescind its previous proposal to transfer preliminary reparations goods to the Allied nations. Officials here acknowledged that the implication of this statement is the termination of Japanese reparations and the cessation of the transfer of machinery and equipment to China, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and the Netherlands under the preliminary transfer of reparations goods plan. They indicated that directives concerning this matter will soon be sent to General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Tokyo. McCoy explained the main reasons for the US taking its current position as follows: "(A) Japan's economic deficit has little hope of being balanced in the near future, and achieving balance will ultimately require all the resources at Japan's disposal. (B) The burden of removing Japanese advanced reparations materials could have a serious impact on stabilizing the Japanese economy and allowing it to move toward the occupation goal of self-sufficiency. (C) Despite repeated US voluntary assistance in the past three years, the Far Eastern Commission has made little or no progress in drafting a schedule of reparations allocations. Without an agreement on a schedule of reparations allocations, all current policy decisions of the Far Eastern Commission on the issue of reparations cannot be implemented. (D) Japan has already paid considerable reparations by relinquishing its former overseas assets and has also paid smaller reparations under the pre-transfer plan." McCoy added: "In view of these conclusions, the US government has had to rescind the interim directive of April 4, 1947, and terminate the pre-transfer plan stipulated by that directive. At the same time, the US government has had to withdraw its proposal of November 6, 1947, regarding Japan's reparations allocations and notify the Secretary-General accordingly. Finally, the US government takes this opportunity to announce that it has no intention of taking further unilateral action under the authority of its interim directives to remove reparations materials from Japan." McCoy said: "Our current problem is not to restrict Japan's peaceful industries, but to revive those industries to supply Japan's minimum needs." He said that in order to solve this problem, the US recommends "allowing Japan to develop its peaceful industries without restriction." He declared that this development includes the use of "major war equipment," which has already been stripped of its "war equipment" characteristics. On this point, he continued: "The United States believes that all equipment, including the 'major war equipment' currently designated for reparations, that can contribute to Japan's recovery should be utilized. This equipment is essential to Japan's peaceful economy." However, he emphasized that the US continues to support the principle that Japan should not be allowed to restore its capacity to engage in war. The US plans to immediately request the Far Eastern Commission to pass recommendations concerning Japan that are consistent with the position he has explained. Regarding the government's current position on the issue of Japanese reparations, officials feel that the US has taken all reasonable steps to achieve a formal solution to the reparations issue, thereby creating in Japan a sense of stability necessary for industrial recovery. Among several related proposals for a solution, they recalled that in November 1947, the US submitted to the Far Eastern Commission a schedule of reparations percentages, listing the reparations amounts for all eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission. China and the United States were to receive the most. However, the US suggested that if other countries accepted the schedule, the US would be willing to relinquish its entire share of reparations to other countries. This suggestion, like other suggestions, was not accepted due to political factors.</p>

<p>In the 4th Table Tennis League, Lianxing played Bank of China (甲組聯星出戰中行) in the first division league the day before yesterday. Lianxing came on stage with five strong players, with a magnificent momentum and a state of easily defeating the Bank of China. Unexpectedly, the Bank of China had a strong fighting spirit and resisted bravely. Although the first and third groups were defeated, the main player Zhu Yongkang and the chopper Gao Zhonglin, each with an indomitable spirit, did not feel discouraged after losing the first game. They calmly responded to the battle, and sure enough, they turned the tide. They won two games in a row. The two successively defeated Lianxing's strong players Zhang Shanda and Chen Xingquan with a score of 2-1, winning back the second and fourth groups, making the Bank of China each tie at 2-2. The last group was the key to the survival of both sides. The Bank of China discovered that the strong player Wang Shaozeng was missing, so they had to send a reserve player Tu Guangrong to fight against Lianxing team leader Hu Yiping. Tu's skills were lower than Yiping's, so he was not an opponent of Yiping. He allowed the opponent to attack and was at a loss. In the end, he lost two games in a row. As a result, Lianxing won 3-2. Although the Bank of China lost this battle, the record was far better than before, and it can be said that they had done their best. The record of the two teams is explored as follows:</p>
<p>(Lianxing) Score (Bank of China)</p>
<p>Wu Zuojing</p>
<p>(21-14 21-19)</p>

<p>Today (14th), there will be one first division match and two second division matches. In the first division, Quanlv will play against Qinglian. The latter has lost four matches in a row, and the morale has declined. Quanlv has defeated the Youwu Post Office and the Kunzhong Army of Post Office B. Under its command, in addition to the veteran Wang Yishan, who is already an outdated figure, the rest, such as Dai Yixing, Zhang Juchen, and Lu Yongkang, are full of energy and resourceful in combat. Qinglian must be cautious and careful in this battle, otherwise, it may still be difficult to escape the fate of defeat.</p>
<p>In the second division, Dagong will play against the seeded Ling team. Dagong has won against two weak teams. Today, under the supervision of team leader Xu Junyuan, they will definitely go all out to compete with the Ling team. It is expected that a fierce battle between the two sides is inevitable. In addition, in the second division two, Nongji B will play against You 18. The former has lost five battles in a row, and the spirit is very good. This battle is still not an enemy of You 18.

<p>[Central News Agency] The Shanghai Municipal Public Utility Fee Calculation Method Review Committee was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Mayor Chen, as chairman, briefly stated: Due to the increase in oil and coal prices, the calculation index of various public utility companies in the city is high, and users feel overwhelmed. However, in this difficult period, it is hoped that both the company and users will consider the difficult times, cooperate sincerely, understand and make concessions, and overcome the difficulties together. Subsequently, the Public Utilities Bureau reported on the cost calculation process. Senators, company and industrial association representatives all made statements, and the discussion was very enthusiastic. The two resolutions and the principles of the revised public utility pricing method passed are recorded as follows: Two resolutions: (1) For users who pay according to the announced public utility index, the part exceeding 680,000 times will be refunded by the company to the user. (Deducted from subsequent payments.) (2) For those who pay according to 370,000 times or 30%, and those who have not paid, from May 14th to the date of the announcement of the price based on the newly revised formula, all will be calculated and paid at 680,000 times. (Paid within three days of the company's bill being delivered to the user.)</p>
<p>Principles for Revising Public Utility Pricing Methods</p>
<p>(1) Please have the Central Bank, the US Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch, the Shanghai Office of the Bituminous Coal Regulation Committee, and the Four Coal Mine Joint Operations Office adjust the prices of fuel coal and oil used by public utilities every half month thereafter. As for the prices currently set, they should also be reduced first. (2) Please have the Ministry of Finance exempt public utilities from import duties on fuel and equipment. (3) Please have the Central Bank continue to lend to public utilities at the rate of 600,000 US dollars in Gold Yuan per half month, and continue to lend according to the original method, for the turnover of various public utility companies. (4) In order to take into account the burden on the people and to maintain the survival of public utilities in the city, and to overcome the difficulties together, from now on, the pricing formulas for the four items of water, electricity, gas, and telephone should be re-determined according to the absolutely necessary expenses of various public utility companies, such as oil, coal, wages, taxes, and all miscellaneous expenses for maintaining business. Depreciation and profits will not be calculated for the time being. The Public Utilities Bureau will formulate a draft, which will be implemented after being approved by the Review Committee. (5) From the day after the implementation of the above pricing formula, the Public Utilities Bureau will calculate the amount of water, electricity, gas, and telephone charges based on the formula and the various market prices of the previous day, and announce them in the newspaper. In the future, the calculation and adjustment will be based on changes in the prices of various factors in the formula, and the principle will be to adjust it every half month for the time being. Users will pay within three days from the date the company's bill is delivered. (6) Factories that are willing to exchange oil or coal for water, electricity, and gas from the company may be allowed to do so. The Public Utilities Bureau will formulate the method and submit it to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation. (7) The oil or coal used by the company may be taken in advance and paid in installments, which will be handled by the Municipal Government in consultation with the competent authority. (8) All fares for public transportation will remain the same for the time being. The Public Utilities Bureau will formulate another pricing formula based on necessary expenses such as fuel and wages, but the principle will be to adjust it twice a month for the time being.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Land Administration Bureau is handling the land general registration business in six districts, namely Huangpu, Hunan, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Fahua, and Caohejing.

There is also no circumstantial evidence available to verify whether the property rights are true. Although staff have been sent to conduct on-site investigations, it is still difficult to make a definitive determination quickly. In order to facilitate handling, the procedures for handling these cases are set as follows: (1) Order the owner to first set up a boundary and declare the loss of the property certificate in the newspaper, and then apply for measurement. (2) Draw a public announcement map according to the measurement results and post it on the announcement office in front of the gate of the bureau, the Baojia (保甲) office where the land is located, and the location of the land. A fee may be charged for this public announcement map. (3) For registration cases where the draft map has already been signed and confirmed, the aforementioned public announcement procedures should still be completed. (4) The public announcement map will be publicly announced for one month. If no one raises any objections after the expiration of the public announcement period, the owner shall obtain guarantees from the four neighbors or reliable shopkeepers and submit them to the bureau for verification. Those who already have guarantees must re-check the guarantees. (5) For all the above procedures that have been completed, refer to the precedent of land grading and tax assessment without grain department records, pay 40% of the prescribed land price, and issue a certificate of title. (6) All owners who fail to follow the above procedures will be rejected, and a public announcement of ownerless land will be processed immediately.</p>

<p>National Bank Sales Were Slightly Softer Yesterday</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, in the gold market, because gold prices in other cities were high and far out of sync with the local market, various parties had strong buying interest, and there was a shortage of supply, resulting in chaotic asking prices.

The Central Bank quickly entrusted Dadecheng Gold Store to sell at a price of 2.9 billion yuan, pushing it down to 2.85 billion, releasing a total of 128 large bars. The rising trend slowed near noon and finally closed at 2.85 billion.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, because peers were rushing to pay the Central Bank's gold sales, they were not in the mood to trade. The Central Bank once again entrusted Dadecheng Gold Store to continue selling at a price of 2.8 billion, but no one accepted the offer, and nothing was sold, resulting in a further increase of 400 million compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Another report: US dollars stood out in off-market trading. Because it had been weak for a long time, it had an inverted spread with other cities.

In addition to the South China line, those coming and going from Suzhou and Wuxi were also absorbing it, and the sentiment was very firm. The trading was active, with the morning opening at 4.8 million and 5.3 million, rising to 5.3 million and 5.8 million. It closed at 5 million and 5.5 million at noon, and once hit 5.5 million and 6 million in the afternoon.

Vendors were reluctant to sell. 20-cent coins were asking as high as 150,000 and 200,000, 10-cent coins rose to 70,000 and 100,000, and 5-cent coins were also popular at 30,000 and 50,000, an increase of 10,000 to 20,000 compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Rice Market Initially Strong, Then Weak <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was initially strong, then weak. The morning opened with owners initially asking higher prices due to the continued scarcity of arriving goods. However, because of the imminent distribution of household rice, rice shops' actual sales were sluggish, and the market gradually turned downstream. High-quality white japonica rice barely held steady at 41 million yuan wholesale. Other medium and low-quality rice fell by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Thin indica rice fell slightly by 500,000 yuan, and the North City also saw a decline, with white japonica rice falling by 2 million yuan, retreating to 42 million yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains continued to rise, with soybeans rising by 10% to 20,000. Mung beans had active sales, also rising sharply by 10%. Raw peanuts opened at 4 million, and Linhuaiguan opened at 36 million. There were few transactions for rice in bags, and red sorghum did not open.</p>
<p>Flour continued to rise. Because the market price was far out of sync with the price of rice, suppliers were trying to catch up, and asking prices were extremely high. Inbound wholesalers were quite eager, and many stopped absorbing at the high prices, so the market was at a stalemate. Furthermore, with the surge in gold and banknotes, sentiment became even tighter, and market prices generally strengthened by 10%. Old-brand flour was priced at 11.5 million, and Bingchuan (military ship), Hongfeng (red bee), and Jiancheng (built city) were all priced at 10.5 million, and Dafa was priced at 11.1 million.</p>
<p>The price of edible oil continued to rise sharply. It was heard that prices of various external commodities were rising sharply, and those in charge were strongly raising prices. The market price jumped by 10 million. Factory-pressed bean oil opened at 140 million in the morning, once trading as high as 160 million, but individual investors sold at the high prices, falling back by 10 million. Dayou closed at 150 million in the afternoon. The price of raw oil rose even more sharply, with factory-produced raw oil rising to 160 million, and the price of raw rapeseed oil rose more moderately. Dayou closed at 125 million.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market yesterday saw weak sentiment and increased supply. The market initially stabilized and then softened. However, because external financial items were strengthening, prices were driven up, but in terms of gold conversion, it was apparently increasing but actually decreasing.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 98 million, and various groups sold off in succession. Local wholesalers reduced their buying interest, and the market softened, falling to 92.5 million at noon. 40-count and 31-count were initially high and then low. 21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 54 million, and there were many sellers, and the market was flat and soft. Later, there was a slight increase in buying interest, and the asking price rose slightly, closing near noon at 60 million. The trend for 20-count and below was mediocre.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Cotton Cloth Unchanged <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market continued to be unchanged. A large amount of cloth distributed to employees of China Textile Mills and other factories as salary compensation poured out, and the market continued to decline. Local peers still had weak sales and showed no interest in buying. Even though gold and banknotes were rising, sentiment remained weak.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth initially opened low at 16.8 million, and then fell back to 16 million, a decrease of 1 million compared to the previous day. Four Gentlemen poplin fell from 17.4 million to 16.4 million, a decrease of 1.2 million. Low-end cloth also proved unsustainable. Longtou B and Dashuanglong fine cloths each fell by another 600,000, and Fufu traded at 14.4 million, falling by 800,000. Longmen fine cloth closed at 13.6 million. The buying interest for Four Gentlemen Yuanfu silk was slightly active, initially trading at 26.4 million, closing at 26 million at noon, an increase of 800,000 compared to the previous day. The market for privately-owned factories remained flat and weak.</p>

A fierce quarrel broke out one night a few days ago, and then they went to bed. Fan's eldest son, Zhongyin, slept with his grandmother in the same bed. When he got up the next morning, he called for his grandmother, but she did not respond. Fan and others rushed to look and found that Zhang had hanged herself in the bed.

<h3 id="e74">Before and After the Fall of Hangzhou <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Green Continent</p>
<p>[Report from Our City] On the morning of May 1st, around 4:00 AM, Hangzhou was awakened from its slumber by intense artillery fire. Citizens explored the source of the artillery fire with heavy hearts. After dawn, the shops did not open, and the streets were desolate. There were very few silver brokers in the Guankou area, and the big head price plummeted. No one wanted the Gold Yuan, and scattered transactions were priced in silver dollars. A set of big cake and fried dough sticks was being bargained for at two jiao. However, the price of rice was very cheap, about four yuan per dan. There were almost no pedestrians on the street, only the occasional fire truck patrolling and speeding by, which was heartbreaking. However, all newspapers were still operating as usual, competing to publish extra editions, which sold exceptionally well. Generally, people embraced the idea that a storm was coming and accepted it calmly.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 2nd, the rumbling of artillery fire was intermittent. By the morning of the 3rd, it had completely turned into a silent state. The air was very quiet, as if the storm had already passed. The day was sunny and clear. Citizens probed their heads into the streets with a strange feeling, talking to each other and inquiring. In order to clarify the truth, the author specifically visited the New Gathering Group of the 77th Division in the Army Hospital near the Dafosi Temple. However, the Zhenglu, Hubin, and Municipal Government areas were under martial law, and large trucks loaded with materials passed by in succession. After the author showed his credentials, it took a lot of persuasion to get through to the vicinity of the Municipal Government. A temporary police officer of the Self-Defense Force told me that the Communist army had reached Luodianzi, forty li from the city, and traffic on the Songmu Pasture area had been cut off. After arriving at the New Gathering Group, the house had been emptied, with only a few soldiers still sorting out the remaining items. When I inquired with them, I got nothing, and they only said that the Communist army was still forty to fifty li away. So I took a car to the Provincial Government Secretariat and other relevant agencies, but they were also ordered to evacuate on the evening of the 2nd, and the rooms were empty and desolate, realizing the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>The last train to Shanghai left at noon, fully loaded with military families and rushed to transport items. Most of the refugees were blocked outside the station and unable to board the train. From about 4:00 PM, suddenly there were several loud explosions. After the author inquired, I found out that the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command and the team had withdrawn from Hangzhou to a new position. At about 5:00 PM, the communication with Shanghai was interrupted. At about 6:00 PM, a notice from the "Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang" was posted on the street, announcing that citizens should operate their businesses with peace of mind, not disturb themselves, and assist the Communist army in entering the city and taking over various agencies and public utility institutions, etc. The notice was issued by Zhang Tianyi, Chief Captain of the Hangzhou City Security Brigade, and Deputy Captain Zheng Yuming. It was also rumored that the Communist army's advance troops of more than 4,000 people had arrived at the Municipal Government and the Hubin Hotel area. The order among the citizens was still good. In the evening, suddenly saw red light filled the sky in the direction of the Songmu Pasture, and black smoke obscured the sky, and there were sparse gunshots. The actual situation was unclear, but the general citizens became panicked again, carrying boxes and cages to escape. I hired a tricycle with my old mother at the cost of one big head yuan to take temporary shelter at the home of my friend Zhou at Wulong Temple, South Xingqiao. The car was blocked by crowded citizens and boxes of belongings on Shuishi Street, Cangqiao Street, Fengshanmenwai Street, and South Xingqi. It was already 1:00 AM when we arrived at Zhou's house. I heard that there were ships at the Sanlang Temple Yidu Wharf that could go to Haiyan, so I accompanied my old mother to the riverbank. However, the refugees on the riverbank rushed to board the ship first, and the cries of wives being separated from their husbands and children were heartbreaking. It was not until about 4:00 AM on the 4th that I hired a double-masted fishing boat at the cost of seven big head yuan and one mace heavy gold ring. Fourteen people on the same boat shared the boat fare. There was an old man in tattered clothes on the boat. After talking, I found out that he was the principal of a certain middle school in Hangzhou, and he was deeply saddened by everything the Communist army did when they entered the city.</p>
<p>After boarding the boat, because I was very tired from running around all day, I fell into a drowsy state and left Hangzhou in the glaring sunlight of the 4th. The Jiangnan escape boats were incessant. The green waves were rippling, and the distant mountains were distinct. With a heavy heart, I left Hangzhou, looked into the clouds, and unbidden emotions arose.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Wedding of a Tianshan Mongol Prince <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Juemin</p>
<p>Spring Melody Begins</p>
<p>When mentioning Prince Ban, every Mongol nomad in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains praises him as a hero. He was the leader of the Heshuote tribe on the northwest bank of Bosten Lake. He was born exceptionally brave. According to Dorji, the deputy head of Heshuk County and a progressive Mongol youth who studied in the Soviet Union, Prince Ban personally led a Mongol legion in Yanqi, defeated He Jiani Yazi, and then fought against Commander Ma Zhongying. Just as Ma Zhongying was being utterly defeated and struggling, Sheng Shicai, using his usual charge of "conspiracy and riot," imprisoned Prince Ban. Prince Ban believed he was very loyal to the government at the time and never dreamed that misfortune would befall him. He suffered this injustice for no reason and soon died of anger. Miss Li Jie, who is marrying the Tianshan Mongol prince this time, is the only beloved daughter left by Prince Ban. Prince Ban had three wives. The first and second wives did not have any children. Li Jie was born to Prince Ban's third wife, Ban Leqi. After Prince Ban's death, Ban Leqi remarried to an ordinary Mongol commoner. She is now only in her thirties. Thus, Li Jie, orphaned and alone, was raised by Prince Dawa, who inherited Prince Ban's position, herding sheep on the grasslands along the shores of Bosten Lake, like a very ordinary shepherdess. She was born very intelligent, knows graceful Mongol songs and dances, can play the Mongol ancient instrument "Tuokexiwote," and also studied in Mongol schools for a few days. Originally, she was betrothed to the son of Deputy Director Tao (Mongol ethnicity) of the former Heshuk Police Bureau. However, last year, after Man Guangqi, the son of Prince Man Han, inherited his father's position and became Prince Gong Han, his birth mother, Niao Jingbin, felt that her son had grown up and could establish a career and family at the same time. At this time, the leaders of the Heshuote and Hejing tribes proposed a marriage alliance. It is said that one day on the grasslands along the shores of Bosten Lake, many Mongol girls were gathered for Prince Gong Han to choose from. Among the girls, needless to say, Li Jie naturally became Prince Gong Han's only favorite, because Li Jie was not only very intelligent but also very beautiful, and her charming and affectionate eyes, her egg-shaped face, at first glance, looked very much like her mother. Her height was neither tall nor short. Her dignified, gentle, and full figure revealed the charm of a young girl. She was born at 巳 hour on the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth month of the twenty-third year (of the Republic), and is only fifteen years old now, the perfect age of a young maiden, no wonder Prince Gong Han fell in love with her at first sight. After this fairytale-like beautiful day, the leaders of the two tribes formally proposed marriage, and Li Jie and the young Mongol prince officially became engaged on January 6th of this year.</p>
<p>A tender spring melody blew on the shore of the lake, and from then on, Li Jie no longer felt lonely. With the arrival of spring, the spring breeze rippled the clear lake water, seemingly warming Li Jie's heart even more. In the flying days as the wedding day approached, the marching melody of "Give Me Muna" became more and more vigorous and tense.</p>
<p>Eve of the Wedding</p>
<p>On the day before the wedding, the groom, Prince Gong Han, rode a very extraordinary Yanqi horse to the bride's house to greet the bride. The horse's age and the age of the horse handler were carefully calculated, and the horse's saddle and body were also decorated very luxuriously. It is said that at dawn on the 25th, everyone in the yurts on Heshuk Beach was already drunk and sad. At the moment before Li Jie left Heshuk Beach, all the men, women, and children of the entire tribe really shed tears. Li Jie's relatives dragged her, unwilling to let her go. Finally, she was forcibly dragged onto the bridal sedan chair, which was carried by two white horses. At this time, the three to several hundred horsemen welcoming the bride surrounded the bride and galloped triumphantly, shouting all the way. From Heshuk to Hejing, there were about a hundred kilometers. They arrived at the prince's mansion at four o'clock in the afternoon. Earlier that day, at eleven fifteen in the morning, Prince Gong Han returned, surrounded by dozens of horsemen shouting. Prince Gong Han wore a top hat, a long gown, and a mandarin jacket, appearing cultured and refined, and not like a young hero of the grasslands. But when he took the lead and entered the prince's mansion with high spirits and joy overflowing from his eyebrows, this Tianshan Mongol prince could still be said to be a handsome young man. On this day, Dao Jingbin, Xi Muzhen, and Niao Jingbin's daughter, Manlin, as well as all the Mongol women who usually had the most fashionable hairstyles and wore the most fashionable cheongsams, all reverted to their original appearance and dressed in the Mongol women's style. The bridal chamber yurt was decorated. The path that the bride would take after entering the door was also marked by lamas. Auspicious clouds were covered with red cloth strips. Everything was ready. Niao Jingbin was supposed to get on the sedan chair at 卯 hour and get off at 未 hour, but the bride did not arrive until four o'clock in the afternoon. By that time, the entire city of Hejing had been hanging flags for a day. My brother Fanqun and I hurriedly jumped on our horses and ran to the streets. From the southern end of the street all the way to the prince's mansion, the crowds were so dense that no water could pass through. In addition to the horsemen welcoming and sending the bride, there were those watching on horseback, those climbing trees to watch, and those standing on the rooftops to watch. Everyone was competing to see this unprecedented spectacle in Hejing. It was indeed extremely lively. The sun was shining warmly. In an atmosphere of jubilation, the first to walk towards the prince's mansion was the military band, followed by the ceremonial guard holding flags and umbrellas, then the team of lamas chanting scriptures, and finally the bridal sedan chair surrounded by hundreds of people and horses. The people on horseback, both men and women, were drunk and swaying, and shouting and singing. In front of the bridal sedan chair was a red cloth happy tent as large as a square zhang, followed by the women sending the bride and two "Donggan" horse grooms calling out to carry the sedan chair. The procession almost filled the only main street of Hejing County. At this time, many poor people were pulling ropes in several places to block the way and ask for lucky money. Thus, banknotes flew around. Such chaos and noise lasted for more than half an hour before they reached the prince's mansion. We had already abandoned our horses and squeezed into the crowd. He was taking exciting shots, and I was searching for touching materials. By the time we squeezed into the prince's mansion, it was a complete mess. After many Mongol ceremonies were performed, the bride finally walked into that yurt, still covered by the red curtain. The bride had been waiting for a long time.</p>
<p>Give Me Muna</p>
<p>On both sides of the hall, two large yurts were set up. The one on the right was filled with Lamaist statues and was the place to perform the "Zhi Wo Muna" ceremony. The one on the left was the bridal chamber, with extremely luxurious furnishings and decorations! There were also two iron beds inside. The bride sat on the iron bed on the left, still covered by the red curtain. Above was an image of Guanyin. In the middle were "paozi" and dishes for the god's banquet. Incense was offered, kowtows were performed, and hymns were sung. Except for offering wine during the ceremony, the order of "Give Me Muna" was largely the same as the old-fashioned wedding etiquette of the Han people. In short, the yurt was filled with people. Until late at night, that bridal chamber was still noisy. Perhaps this was the Mongol's "making a fuss in the bridal chamber"!</p>
<p>On the morning of the 26th, Li Jie met her parents-in-law. In the yurt, she offered wine and rice to her parents-in-law, and then offered wine again. Each time wine was offered, everyone had to sing once. The hosts of both the bride's and groom's families also offered wine and rice to each other. After offering wine and rice, they solemnly entrusted the bride to Prince Man Han, Niao Jingbin, and Xi Muzhen. Finally, the bride's family said goodbye, and one by one, the men and women of the bride's family shed tears again. This ceremony lasted until one thirty in the afternoon. That afternoon, a curtain-cutting ceremony was also held, and the red happy curtain covering the bride was taken away. Inside the yurt, everyone was Mongol, performing Mongol ceremonies and speaking Mongol words. What did I understand? I only remembered one Mongol sentence that Prince Gong Han told me at the time: This is the Mongol's "Give Me Muna," what you call "marriage."</p>

<p>— Translated by Zhen Jun</p>
<p>The rift between Tito and Stalin has now become even more pronounced. In Yugoslavia, the brutal killing of an officer who supports the Soviet Union is already a common occurrence. Tito is taking a resistant attitude towards the Soviet Union. He wants to eliminate the Soviet echoers in the country and seek ways to sanction the Soviet followers, so that everyone no longer cares about Stalin.</p>
<p>The shortcomings and stains of Yugoslavia under the Soviet system have been fully exposed, arousing the people's hatred for Moscow's Cold War offensive. This is obviously a swift and powerful final test between dictators.</p>
<p>Stalin is now becoming increasingly indifferent to the debates between the United States and the Western European alliance. His attention has turned to another aspect, because he is urgently patching up what may be the weakest link in the Soviet empire. This is Yugoslavia, located in the southwest underbelly of the Soviet Union, which Churchill called "the soft underbelly of Europe." When the Soviet Union finds that the loyalty of this link is indeed doubtful, they can take any means, direct the army to attack, or use the power of the air force to destroy Yugoslavia entirely.</p>
<p>Until today, Stalin's attempt to seize Yugoslavia</p>
<p>The effort to enter the Soviet system has been declared a failure. Obstruction and condemnation, as well as more than a month of public disclosure of secrets, have all been ineffective. Something close to a miracle has happened in the circle of communists, that is, the communist party on the European continent even attempts to launch an open attack.</p>
<p>And Tito's struggle for seats in the parliament has made him unable to gain a foothold in Yugoslavia, or forced him to issue an apology, or activities to disperse his support, have all failed.</p>
<p>The contest between dictators has already begun, and Stalin is obviously intolerant of rebellious and challenging actions. This is a blow to the strength of the Soviet Union, and this restless poison may also spread to other parts of the Eastern European bloc, giving Western European countries an opportunity to attack this unexpected weakness in the Soviet camp. However, Stalin will obviously maintain the racial harmony between the two countries, and at the same time take concerted action against Western Europe through voting. Then the Western European countries will be expelled from Belgrade, and then Stalin will easily turn around and deal with the rising Tito.</p>
<p>This is very important. Stalin's tentative action is to understand the opposing relationship between him and Tito, and what the actual internal situation of Yugoslavia today is like.</p>
<p>The center of all disputes will eventually come down to this question: Who is the master of Yugoslavia—Stalin or Tito? This question has never become so serious and acute in other satellite countries of the Soviet Union, but in Yugoslavia, since the end of the war, this annoying question has been growing, and each continuation of the dispute shows that it should be attributed to Chairman Stalin wanting to entrap Tito.</p>
<p>As early as during the war, Tito committed a serious "mistake." He showed an unusually cold and unresponsive attitude to the advice and assistance of the designers sent by Moscow to assist him in drafting the Five-Year Plan. Tito's ideal was not only to draft this great plan, but also to inspire the enthusiasm of the entire people to participate in this nation-building movement. So Moscow warned that Tito's plan was too childish and the outline was not clear enough.</p>
<p>This is an insignificant plan. Finally, Moscow accused Tito of not establishing a labor-based society, but that was necessary. If the communists come forward to govern, then they can dedicate themselves to completing it. An agricultural society can gradually improve only under firm leadership.</p>
<p>Yugoslav farmers are still as far away from the Soviet collective farm system as before. The Kremlin's order is for Tito to liquidate the local tyrants and transfer all their land to state-owned farms, forcing all</p>
<p>Farmers cooperate and cultivate together. Intellectuals also have to leave Belgrade and go deep into the countryside, but he did not implement it in this way. On the contrary, Tito promised the farmers of Yugoslavia—who account for 80% of the country's population—that they can cultivate freely and individually, and at the same time adopt the means of manipulating crop prices to make their lives better than the living standards of industrial areas. Tito also risked promising the farmers of Yugoslavia that they will have the freedom of private livestock. These measures have made Stalin very annoyed and cannot be forgiven.</p>
<p>The Communist Party in Yugoslavia does not have the effectiveness of a lively movement. This may be one of the factors that makes Stalin unhappy. Tito insists that the party organization should maintain a democratic style, so that the boundaries of the party are not clear, and communists and non-communists can have close contact and live in harmony. Tito is willing to eliminate non-party members, but he has never put the Communist Party above the country first, or allowed all workers in the country to receive the most satisfactory remuneration. Party members oppose Tito's reckless style, despising their "great contribution" to the country and the times, which also surprised their friends in Moscow. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The representative of the Hui people ruling the southwest is General Ma Bufang of Qinghai. The reporter once drove to Xining, 150 miles west of Lanzhou, and visited him in his Western-style residence. After we entered Qinghai, we saw that Qinghai was working hard to promote some public works. Saplings are planted everywhere (it is said that in five years, Qinghai will afforest 600,000 trees), highways have been built, irrigation plans are being drafted, measures to increase timber production have been implemented, public clinics have been set up in many places, and compulsory schools have also been established in various places, and its performance is better than other parts of China.</p>
<p>The reporter met General Ma Bufang at 7 o'clock in the morning. His sparse beard made him appear much taller than he actually was. He extremely hates communism.</p>
<p>In fact, the Hui Muslim army led by General Ma Bufang is willing to fight and fights well. The reporter once saw them training in Xining, which was indeed stricter than other Chinese troops. However, Ma only has 100,000 troops, and because the defense line is too long, stretching from Dihua to the front line of Shaanxi, the defense force is not very strong. Recently, during the Southwest Provincial Leaders Conference held in Lanzhou, Ma requested that troops be transferred from various provinces to supplement him. Ma's army has very few heavy weapons, and their weapons are not uniform due to supply difficulties. He also has no arsenal. Recently, General Chennault's civil aviation team opened the Dihua air route, and only then did they airlift 50 tons of US aid materials to him.</p>
<p>Another Muslim military leader is Ma Hongkui of Ningxia Province. Since the area he rules is closer to the Communist area, he is not as optimistic as Qinghai about resisting the Communist invasion.</p>
<p>500 miles away from Ningxia is Chongqing in Sichuan, the wartime capital of China. Mayor Yang Sen is a famous military strategist. He claims that the Chinese people are afraid of communism.</p>
<p>In Sichuan, the common people often need two to three days to carry rice from various villages to the Tielian office to pay their taxes. Not only do they have to pay for their own food on the road, but the staff of the Tielian office often refuse to accept their rice on the grounds that it is of poor quality. However, the rice that is paid is often taken by speculators and sold on the market. Rice prices fall during the harvest and rise when there is a shortage of food.</p>
<p>Regardless of the state of peace talks, there are many soldiers here. No matter when and where you are, you will encounter people in uniform. In Lanzhou, there are no checkpoints, so soldiers replace them to check your luggage. On the border between Qinghai and Gansu, they are also responsible for the inspection. In Chengdu, there are very few coolies to carry luggage for travelers, and soldiers have taken over this job. On the highways of Hanzhong, Xi'an, and Sichuan, military transportation is frequent. Since there are frequent bandit alerts near Kunming, a part of the army is being transferred to guard and protect it.</p>

<p>To the Editor: A wandering old man named Wu Dawen, 56 years old, from Dongshan, Dongting, was recently discovered in the alley of my residence. He came to Shanghai to visit his wife and daughter but failed, resulting in him wandering helplessly. He only knows that his son-in-law has a factory in Zhabei, and his wife is also living with their foster daughter, but he does not know his son-in-law's name or address. Moreover, he is suffering from illness and is in a very pitiful state. I am writing to you specifically, and I respectfully request that your column disclose this information immediately. If his family can be reunited because of this and avoid wandering to death, I will not forget the kindness of your column. If any reader knows the address of his wife and daughter, please notify the Shanghai Postal Staff Consumer Cooperative at No. 304 North Suzhou Road, Shanghai (telephone 40411). Sincerely, Reader Qu Zuxi, May 10th</p>
<h3 id="e80">Legal Q&amp;A <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi</p>
<p>[Question from Mr. Fu Daxing] A has no children, B has two sons, and C has four sons. When A was alive, he designated B's eldest son to be adopted. Later, because C's eldest son disputed the inheritance, he gave him six mu of private land. However, C's eldest son died unmarried, and A, seeing that C was poor, agreed to take it back after C's death. After C died, his second, third, and fourth sons also passed away one after another, leaving only the second and third daughters-in-law and two nieces. With the public discussion of relatives, the land was provided for the two daughters-in-law to maintain their livelihoods. Now C's third daughter-in-law intends to adopt a son from another family, and C's second daughter-in-law intends to take in a son-in-law. Please advise (1) After the deaths of C's second and third daughters-in-law, can A's heirs take back the land that was given, or can it be taken back without waiting for the deaths of the two daughters-in-law? (2) Is there a statute of limitations for this type of event?</p>
<p>[Answer] According to the situation described in your question, the six mu of land seems to be a gift, and no conditions for recovery were attached. Moreover, the inheritance has been going on for a long time, so I am afraid it cannot be recovered.</p>
<p>[Question from Mr. He Guoxiong] (1) After I got engaged to Miss Wang, a relationship has occurred. If she becomes pregnant in the future, and is known by the girl's family, If the family takes me to court, am I criminally liable in law? (2) If the girl's family wants to declare a cancellation of the engagement, but both parties are unwilling, is the cancellation legally valid?</p>
<p>[Answer] (1) Since you know that there is criminal liability under the law, you should marry Miss Wang as soon as possible. It is believed that Miss Wang's family will not refuse, as both parties are already engaged. If her family asks for a delay, Miss Wang can explain the situation tactfully, and it is believed that they will not insist. (2) The engagement is determined by the wishes of the parties involved. Moreover, under these circumstances, the girl's family is unlikely to insist on canceling the engagement.</p>
