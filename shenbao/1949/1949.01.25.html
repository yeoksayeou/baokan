<h3>國軍撤近最後防線　盼中共方面即停止進兵　迅速派遣代表商談和平</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕此間軍事觀察家廿四日鄭重指出，連日國軍在津南段及長江以北地區之撤退，係因政府主張和平，爲促成國共雙方迅速停戰言和起見，故不必要之據點，均一一將國軍撤退，俾减少無謂之損失，然政府方面係謀取和平，並非投降，此種避免無謂衝突之舉措，亦有其限度，長江爲國軍之最後防綫，爲保衛江南，國軍在江北必須保有若干據點，截至廿四日晚止，國軍已撤至接近最後防綫之地區，如共眾仍繼續進迫，則戰爭殆仍難免。自政院十九日決議建議停戰言和後，政府事實上已採取停戰之措施，且已派定代表，準備與共方和談，共方雖主張和談不必先定停戰條件，吾人現已盡最大之努力，促成和平，甚盼共軍卽日停止進兵，以目前國軍撤出之地區爲緩衝地帶，而迅派代表商談，則和平庶可立致矣。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕一週來國軍日在南撤，可能於舊曆除夕前完全完成守江不守淮之隔岸對峙局面。首都民間心情雖沉重，但無不渴望此一「過渡的苦痛期」及早渡過。</p>

<p>〔本報南通廿四日電〕南通縣府爲策安全，已於長江南岸劉海區設江南辦事處。又地方守備當局發動民夫修築城防。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿四日電〕據未證實消息，李代總統今日已調自崇禧部下五萬人來此，殆係避免國軍違反未來停戰協定或在共方堅持進攻時，作爲拱衛首都之用。</p>
<h3>津浦綫南段正面　兩軍隔滁河對峙　揚州固守·儀徴方面情況轉好</h3>
<p>〔本報浦鎭廿四日電〕國軍爲貫澈確保江南之旣定決策，在江北方面除若干橋頭堡外，餘仍按預定計劃繼續南撤，故連日來津浦南段正面及淮南路暨淮揚公路方面罕有大接觸，其中津浦路滁縣方面担任掩護担子站南撤。廿四日午該部與共軍第十二縱隊一部及江淮軍區獨立旅在鳥衣北五華里處發生遭遇戰，將其擊退後，卽轉進至東葛以南，與共軍隔滁河成對峙狀態。另共軍萬餘進入滁縣後，於廿四日下午二時經由梅家舖，腰舖向全椒前進，國軍胡長淸部已予有力阻擊，刻戰事仍在城外進行中。至六合方面，國軍已於廿三日午後自動放棄。揚州方面，廿四日下午二時半此間與該城通長途電話時，尚由國軍正規軍兩團，地方部隊一團固守，除已與土共數千發生接觸外，該方共軍兩個縱隊主力尚朱參加戰鬥。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕進入六合共軍，爲陳毅部第十二縱隊，陳毅部第十·十一·十二·三個縱隊，廿四日亦集於揚州東北，與我軍激戰，迄晚七時止，揚州仍在我軍手中，滁縣正面國軍今已南撤，退守滁河之南，和縣仍由地方保安團築爲江北橋頭堡，而未放棄。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿四日電〕國軍廿三日由揚州東十五里萬福橋轉移後，業將軌橋炸毀，儀徵方面廿四日經我援軍抵達後，情况轉好。</p>

<h3>孫夫人對和平　提供意見多項</h3>
<p>甘介侯今返京覆命</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕李代總統代表甘介侯氏，來滬與第三方面諸領袖交換時局意見，已獲初步結果。諸氏對代總統之和平努力，一致表示贊助，並願共同努力。對進行和平之方法，已提供多項意見，由甘氏轉達當局。至於諸氏之晋京日期，則將於邵力子·張治中兩政委作進一步洽商後，再行決定。甘氏以任務完畢，定今日訪問陳銘樞後，卽返京覆命。甘氏昨日午後曾訪問孫夫人，談話一小時以上，孫夫人兩週來患血壓過高，謝絕賓客，昨特破例接見甘氏，提供進行和平之意見多項，囑轉達政府。談話間並表示衷心主張和平，以解除人民之痛苦，希望國父之三民主義能眞正實現，如此方能保障永久和平。對於本代總統及其他人士之和平努力，深表同情。</p>
<h3>民盟滬負責人　發表時局見解</h3>
<p>民盟在滬負責人張瀾，羅隆基，黃炎培諸氏昨日亦與甘氏晤面，對時局亦提若干意見及做法，並發表聲明一則，說明渠等對時局之見解，其全文謂：與甘氏晤談後，「知道李德鄰先生準備以毛澤東先生所提出之八點作爲和談基礎，這樣看來，雙方見解相去不遠，我們希望有具體積極的步驟，展開和談。我們對李德鄰先生的和平努力，灤寄同情，今天中國人民，人人股切盼望和平，我們民盟以往曾繼續不斷的爲中國民主和平奮鬥，只要能促進中國的眞民主與眞和平，我們絕不敢逃避責任」。甘氏並曾訪晤張君勱氏，張氏對李代總統之文告表示滿意，並願贊助其和平努力，對時局之態度，則爲主張和平及希望民主制度之建立。至於在滬醫痔之何應欽將軍，本月廿七日可出院，原定休息兩週後返京，甘氏昨特代表李代總統前往訪候，敦促早日晋京，共商國是，何氏已允於在滬度過春節後，卽返京共商大計。</p>
<h3>總統靜居故里　安享天倫之樂　定隊夕備年夜飯與族人暢敍</h3>
<p>〔中央社溪口廿四日電〕蔣總統引退返里後，靜居蔣母墓廬，未接見任何賓客，日與蔣經國夫婦及孫兒等家人共聚天倫之樂，總統今晨曾在墓廬附近散步，瀏覽風景，狀甚愉悅，總統參加革命數十年，宵吁辛勞，從未返里度歲，此次引退返里靜居，適逢歲暮，特定除夕在豐鎬房舊第備年夜飯，藉與族人暢叙，當地父老暨蔣氏族人，亦以總統返里度歲難得，準備在春節期間演戲迎燈，以申迎迓之誠。</p>
<h3>李濟琛等聲明　無礙和談進行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自李濟琛，沈鈞儒等五十五人發表時局意見後，社會人士對和談前途，深抱悲觀，記者昨特以此事之意義，詢諸甘介侯氏，據稱：與各方面研究結果，均認爲此項宣言乃在蔣先生引退之前寫成，故內中只提到元且文告，而對其引退後之情形，隻字未提，故認爲此項宣言之發表，對和談之進行亳無妨碍。甘氏並認爲目前中共攻勢雖未中止，但一旦和談開始後，軍事行動實際上將停止。記者復詢以北平之停戰協定是否可能爲將來和平協定之縮影，甘氏認爲不致如此，因前者爲局部，後者爲全面，不能相提並論，中共之條件，不能超越其所提出之八點，政府亦將提出提案，而以八點爲談判基礎，亦非全盤接受之謂。</p>

<p>〔聯合社南京廿四日電〕政府要員廿四日宣稱，中共電合雖仍繼續抨擊南京政府，但預料共黨必能接受和談建議。另據未證實消息，中共已指定北平爲和談地點，並派周恩來爲共方首席代表</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>亞洲人民合作的開始</h3>
<p>亞洲十九國會議於二十日在新德里開幕後，已於廿三日圓滿閉幕。此次會期雖暫，但已完成其初步任務，對於亞洲各國的自救與互助，已獲有良好的開始。誠如亞洲會議發起人印度總理尼赫魯所謂，「此次亞洲會議實爲遠東人民合作之新時代的先驅。」</p>
<p>綜合此次亞洲會議所討論的主題，不外乎下列兩項：一爲印度總理尼赫魯所提出的檢討荷蘭侵略印尼後所引起之新局勢及應採取的對策；二爲菲律賓代表羅慕洛所提出的亞洲區域安全機構。大會討論四日，十九國代表紛紛發表意見，因爲立塲的一致與利害的相同，故未發生爭辯即商獲成議，爲任何國際會議所罕有的現象。</p>
<p>關於荷印衝突的死灰復燃，世界輿情雖一致譴責荷蘭對印尼的暴行，聯合國安全理事會也要求荷蘭立即停止軍事行動；但荷蘭當局始終不肯放棄其對於印尼所抱的「殖民地主義」，而仍欲在「反共」的煙幕下進行其帝國主義之政策，悍然不顧世界輿情的指摘及安理會的決議。如亞洲有關各國袖手旁觀而不採取「有效行動」，則荷印問題難望有澈底解決的一天。印度總理尼赫魯旣憤於荷蘭在印尼的橫行，同時又爲挽回東南亞洲的危機起見，特發起召開亞洲十九國會議，以自救互助的方式，輔助聯合國安全理事會解決此一問題。在尼赫魯最初的建議中，提出解決荷印爭議的二個步驟，初步的目的，在恢復印尼共和國在荷軍未進攻日惹以前之狀態，俾該國得以自由政府之地位，與荷蘭進行談判，第二步則爲根除他國在亞洲推行殖民主義，使世界各國咸知亞洲決不容忍他國干涉其自由。但在印尼代表看來，仍覺得尼赫魯的建議太迂緩，故要求亞洲各國對荷蘭實行有效的制裁，迫令荷蘭退出印尼。最後討論的結果，決定建議聯合國安全理事會要求荷蘭結束對印尼的統治，並斥責荷蘭對印尼之軍事行動，不啻公然破壞聯合國憲章暨危及東南亞洲以至整個世界之和平。</p>
<p>除了這個籠統的決議而外，並決定十項具體辦法：（一）荷蘭立即釋放印尼各政治領袖；（二）三月十五日以前恢復印尼共和國對爪哇蘇門答臘等區的管轄權；（三）恢復日惹爲印尼共和國之首都；（四）准許印尼人民在國內各地的自由行動；（五）荷蘭於三月十五日以前在外國監督之下完全退出佔領區：（六）撤消各種貿易限制，印尼人民得與世界各國自由往來；（七）印度尼西亞臨時政府應於三月十五日以前組威；（八）所有軍隊概歸臨時政府管轄，荷軍應在指定日期退出東印全境；（九）十一月一日以前完成召開制憲會議之工作；（十）明年一月一日將主權移交印尼政府。這十項辦法週密而完善，但願亞洲各國同心協力，一一促其實現；而且這十項辦法能否完全做到，也就是亞洲各國能否合作互助的一大考騐。</p>
<p>以言亞洲永久性的區域安全機構，在亞洲聯盟高唱入雲的今日，格外有其深刻的含義。此次亞洲會議雖未有具體的決議。僅同意要求與會各國政府研討在聯合國機構的範圍以組織亞洲國家區域安全機構之可能性；但亞洲人民的覺醒及其要求團結一致的願望，已在新德里會議中構成一大不可抗力的主流，使世界列强誰也不能漢視的。當菲國代表羅慕洛演說，言及「亞洲經過數世紀的束縛以後，刻正拋去其鍊案，而爭取其新的自由與權力，讓吾人共同努力，以助亞洲取得其在新世界中所應得的合理地位」時，曾獲得全塲熱烈鼓掌。這從新德里傳出的呼喚，實爲亞洲世紀來臨的先聲，值得列强的重視。更值得我們的珍重！</p>

<h3>疏散聲中話福州</h3>
<p>— 本報記者鄭時渚</p>
<p>〔本報福州廿一日航訊〕在疏散的初期，人們的注意力都集中在美麗的台灣島上，但到了這疏散的末期，成千成萬的人潮湧來了，這海角邊陲的省城，是以又驚又喜的心情來迎接他們。</p>
<p>海軍來了，空軍來了，衢州的綏靖公署撤消，而福州的綏靖公署却成立了。官員們的數目，往往不及他們的眷屬多，因此，空軍供應分處和地勤中隊，加上他們的眷屬，就來了四千人左右·在海軍服務的官兵，很多是福州人，他們眷屬返榕的，當不止此數。連同其他各地經各種關係，經各種公私交通工具疏散而來的，估計福州市內及近郊人口，在最近期內，至少增加四萬人以上。福州人口素稱三十萬人，已增加七份之一，其較明顯而易見的，這些增加的人口中，多非生產者，而消費之購買力，則比一般本地人爲强。福州於近半月中，海陸空運之頻繁，與規模之大，實爲前所未有，一日間竟有廿四架專機降落，一次竟有八十艘小型海輪進口。現各疏散機關仍陸續來榕，人口仍在激增中。</p>
<p>物價在最近半月中，捲起萬丈波瀾，食米於十六日曾一度喊價三千元，旬日間漲十二倍，尤見氣燄迫人。猪肉旬日問由每斤三十元直升九十六元，值此農曆年關，市民每相顧失色。此次漲風以食米爲領導，瞬息間駕於京滬之上，據云係受南流游資之衝激，尤以收購存米，爲主要之刺激。物價猛漲中，竟有類似搶購之情形發生，油市塲十室九空，油缸如洗，卽或稍有存蓄，亦不願大批出售，和平消息傳佈後，各貨雖有微跌，然人心仍多在觀望中。</p>

<h3>英報評新德里會議</h3>
<p>認爲荷在印尼謀設聯邦政府，實爲一明智之舉。各方對荷懷疑，將來終可消弭。</p>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿三日電〕英泰晤士報今日就新德里會議撰論評述稱：「十九國家代表在新德里舉行會議，考慮荷蘭在印尼行動時，尼赫魯於致開會辭中曾謹愼發言，謂會議之目的係加强安理會之腕力，而非成立一保護亞洲利益之敵對亞洲集團。參加會議之國家，西起埃及與伊索比亞，東至澳洲，紐西蘭，與菲列賓，如澳外長伊伐特所稱，彼等均有感於一種願望，卽安理會之命令，應爲印尼所遵行，而在東南亞之全境內，應由聯合國憲軍而非由較舊之種族統治思想，促成西方國家與亞洲人民間所展開之民族主義間之關係。「東半球衆國家之能不分文化與經濟之不同背景，共同力謀密切合作以支持聯合國憲章所闡明之理想，實足令人注意。性質迥別之英國五自治領——紐西蘭，澳大利，印度，巴基斯坦，與錫蘭——全數參加，無疑可加强會中信念——此種合作實係可能者。各種徵象已表明，目前印尼之危機，可能使整個東南改觀，蓋此危機可使亞洲人民相信種族連繫並不如理想之重要，而國際間合作之眞基礎。係秉行自由與公義之原則。「自新德里會議中多數國家，均認爲荷蘭在荷印之行動，爲近於對合法民族主義運動之武力壓迫後，荷蘭政府之在會中痛受攻擊，殆無足驚異。然而，安理會對荷蘭之指責，不應視爲全部賀同印尼共和國之暗示。共和國之觀點在新德里會議中已由甚多代表闡明無遺，然荷蘭方面，雖有充足理由，然由於無人辯護，似有失敗可能。荷蘭政府進攻印尼共和國之前，安理會已開始認識，印尼之民族主義並非一介於共和國願望與荷蘭「殖民主義」間之簡單問題。荷印有若干强有力之集團，雖承認共和國爲彼等同志，然不願承認其爲彼等之主人翁。荷政府計劃一印尼聯邦政府實爲明智之舉。在此計劃中，共和國可有其適當之地位，然不能超過此地位，不幸荷蘭進攻共和國之行動已使人深刻懷疑荷政府之用心，而此項懷疑須至新聯邦政府發生效力時始可消弭。」</p>

<h3>外匯移轉證限制轉讓後　整個貿易大受影響　進出口業電請部會迅予取消</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出口業同業公會爲外匯移轉證，價格低落，影響輸出事業，頃特致電財政部，工商部，輸管會，中央銀行，請求取消央行一七〇號公告。其原文如下：竊查我國國際貿易政策，政府一再標榜爲鼓勵輸出，擴大輸入，而外匯移轉證辦法，卽爲過去實施上項政策之具體表現。實施以來，頗收宏效。不意中央銀行突然發佈一七〇號通告，將外匯移轉證轉讓辦法嚴加限制，於是外匯移轉證價格日見下落，一蹶不振。循至全國各口岸之輸出，幾將全部陷於停頓，而走私逃匯等之不良狀態，又重見於今日。此項辦法，實於整個貿易國策背道而馳。輸出窒息之結果，則外匯收入减少，外匯收入减少，則輸入亦難增加。長此以往，何堪設想。爲補救計，應請立予取消中央銀行一七〇號通告。蓋是項通告，最明顯之後果，造成輸出减少，逃匯及走私增多。國家受嚴重之損失，而對我外銷商品之海外市塲，尤有重大之影響。若以桐油爲例，美國桐油公會，一再要求美國政府，謂中國桐油之成本，按照目前外匯移轉證價格，每磅應在美金四角左右，而在美國市璣之售價，僅有二角一分，足見中國桐油以跌價傾銷方式，侵害美國桐農利益，故美國方而將實施抵制傾銷條例，而課以每磅二角以上之輸入稅，亦正醞釀之中。其他如猪鬃等項，亦有同樣情形發生。歸源其故，卽由於外匯移轉證價格，與實際匯率相差過鉅，而引起逃匯走私之後果。又查國內輸出之貨物，均受香港轉輸出貨物之壓迫，香港貨價平均低於上海輸出貨價百分之三十，蓋卽中於逃匯走私之所致。國內正當輸出事業，反受嚴重之壓迫。且外匯移轉證轉讓辦法改變以後，並未促進輸入。從長期觀察，對輸入更爲不利。故此項限制轉讓辦法，無異殺鷄取卵，實爲不合理之措施。爲特電請鑒核，仰祈轉行中央銀行，迅將一七〇號公告予以撤消，輸出事業實利賴之。</p>
<h3>販戶售貨求現　米價略見下降　麵粉北帮納胃漸旺</h3>
<p>昨日米市略見下降，因販戶大都售貨以作結束，故出戶甚多，且南港產地價格尚低，貨主售意甚濃，價初市尚平，終以米店納胃有限，供多求少，價格下降。北市塲白粳退做一千六百八十元，下跌四十元。薄稻跌五十元，羊秈尚定，陰元低五十元。南市塲白粳·薄稻各跌二三十元，早稻到貨最多，價猛降百元。昨日二市塲到貨共計九千九百八十五石。</p>
<p>麵粉　價格上漲，米價雖跌，北帮納辦北運，故價格扶搖直上。老車初開叩七百元，後續高至七百卅五元收市，較上週六狂漲六十元。兵船粉以七百十元收市，漲五十五元·紅蜂·建成等一致出七百元外，均漲五十餘元。麩皮跟蹤挺升四十元。</p>
<p>雜糧　市塲本定昨日辦理結束手續，但因同業頭寸尚有多餘或缺少者，故仍有少數授受，因供多而下降。黃豆小百元，苞米降五十元，芝蔴·紅糧·茶豆均平定，生仁本街去化尚佳，價亦平平。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>同業仍集市辦理結束手續，但因頭寸關係，仍有少數交易，價格猛降。豆油收市六千四百元，跌九百元。吉桶生油因靑島價低，到貨有望，猛退至六千五百元，劇降一千四百五十元。生菜油五千二百元，降七百元。豆餅削二三十元，一致退進五百內。</p>
<h3>紗市供多求少</h3>
<p>紗市初堅後疲，銀根雖鬆，直銷仍無暢快，僅散戶略有收購，嗣後終因供應過多，市呈欲振乏力之勢，結果各紗平均下跌一成許。四二支藍鳳由八一〇〇〇元步退至七七〇〇〇元收市，終降四〇〇〇元。四〇又藍鳳挫六五〇〇元，三二支銀月初以週末六九〇〇〇元之原擋開出，中途各方均無買意，終以六一〇〇〇元結局，軋跌八〇〇〇元。二一支雙馬現貨自六〇〇〇〇元步退至五〇〇〇〇元爲是低，午收爲五二〇〇〇元，較週末低六〇〇〇元。廠單最後做四五〇〇〇元，亦小五〇〇〇元。套利一天期二五〇〇元。二〇支雙馬鬆落四〇〇〇元，金城及金鷄各跌六〇〇〇元，一六支與一〇支紗皆小三〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>棉布晨初開盤，以執貨者對於和平後之幣制有所顧慮，喊價猛烈抬高，中途外埠銷路淡泊，客帮進意甚懈，本街問津亦少，漲勢終告不支，市乃微步回降，最後以低擋結東，但較週末仍見軋高。龍頭細布初喊二五〇〇元，嗣以紗市報跌，人心轉虛，價乃迂迥下挫，午刻聞喊低至二四〇〇元左右，喇叭童細布由二一〇〇元步退至二〇五〇元爲最低，午收爲二〇七〇元，終升二二〇元。他若三桃與B龍頭細布等，俱各高一五〇元至二五〇元不等。四君子元嗶嘰初開走勢甚　，喊二二五〇尚乏人售出，收市轉疲，爲二二一〇元，較週末挺二四〇元。四君子元直貢漲二九〇元，以二四五〇元結局，餘布去化呆滯，價少變動。</p>
<h3>絲綢市況平疲</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况走勢盤旋，年關迫近，散戶了售不已，進方納胃甚淡，人心疲軟，市上銀根轉鬆，市場卽將休業，交割甚繁，各檔高開低收，結果前市無甚上落，後市趨勢略軟。一二〇號天橋晨開八〇〇〇〇元賣出，銀根見鬆，檯面欲起拉檯，行情似尚有盤堅狀態，後聞棉紗回跌，金鈔又小，執戶情虛急了，市况回瀉，前市七五〇〇〇元午收，後市金鈔繼小，各物均疲，人心益軟，喊價又小二千元。</p>
<p>生絲因人絲市况袞敗，人心無以刺激，年關迫近，洋行均多停止收買，塲上交易轉寂，市勢先盤後小，優級另担前市八五〇〇〇元結束，較上週六微升少許，午後人心極淡，無人問津，市况又見軟弱，喊八三〇〇〇元，八四〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>綢緞因金鈔紗布被壓，業外游資繼續侵軋，市上吸胃尚濃，美亞初以五五〇〇元喊做，走勢穩中帶健，買氣尚旺，喊價卽見再升，略好千元。惟因年關日近，金鈔紗布步步低游，人心稍堅卽軟，塲上了售不已，市勢瞬卽回平，前市五三〇〇〇元了結，與上週六徵見挺升。午後買意閒散，多頭續了，散空抵補，但因金價又小，納胃轉滯，市况頻軟，美亞喊五一五〇〇元有供。</p>
<h3>呢絨買賣稀少</h3>
<p>邇因環境與時令關係，呢絨交易節節减退，門市零剪及茶會上躉批生意，莫不均見寂寞，售價亦莫不受時局及季節關係，一律下游，暗盤較之明盤，尤形軟化，實地成交極少。昨章華花呢减沽一千四百元，一八三〇及一八三一嗶嘰九百五十元，五〇〇九爲七百五十元，雙貓嗶嘰一千元，鴻祥花呢一千三百元，凡立頂一千元，中紡海律司六百五十元</p>
<h3>今後燃煤定價　按台幣兌換率調整</h3>
<p>據船聯會息，該會頃接煤調會代電，以燃煤來源不暢，現僅有台煤能經常供應，故奉令以後煤價，依台幣兌換率調整云。又船聯會以所配燃煤，不數實需用量，曾於最近要求煤調會及中央銀行請在滬儲煤一萬噸，以備各輪公司補充差額，唯迄今尚未接獲煤調會及國行之答覆。</p>
<h3>桐油極少做開</h3>
<p>桐油昨市，足度白油與正牌西洪，公會牌價均仍維持四千元未更，餘如副牌西洪及靑油，同業喊價亦乏起仆，而查交易，則因歲暮在卽，賣買雙方格於舊俗，忙於結算一年來之賬目，是以絕鮮做開。</p>
<h3>茶市沉寂</h3>
<p>時屆農歲暮，本市工商各業大都依俗結算賬目，因此茶葉同業連日無意授受，過程更形岑靜，惟人心則異常穩俏，故市面堪稱堅化。並據業中人云：目前存茶至爲簿弱，貨主咸萌愛不釋手之念。</p>
<h3>內匯率再調整</h3>
<p>國家行局內匯率，昨日又有調整，以廣東區汕頭暨漢口湛江等地最高，每千匯率達二五〇元，其次爲四川區萬縣自流井等地，其餘各地則均未有變動。</p>

<h3>警察新邨款籃球賽　華聯揚威克滬警　胖隊力戰負於警機三分　義球拍賣獲得金圓七萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市警察局爲籌募警察新邨建築經費，昨晚假市體育館舉行籃球義賽，六時開始，愈局長叔平偕警局各官長蒞塲參觀，觀衆近千，頗爲然鬧。愈局長並贈參與四隊錦旗各一面，以誌紀念，警局樂隊伴奏，全塲精神，愈覺興奮。</p>
<p>七時舉行義球拍賣，首由丁君以五萬拍得，但不受球，再由董君以二萬拍去，兩人慷慨可風。首塲衆胖子力戰不敵，卅二比卅五敗於警機一球半。主力戰華聯保持威名，擊破是友化身之滬警雄師。兩隊相逢，一償宿願，頗爲球迷矚目，結果華聯三軍用命，表演良好，四九比卅七勝，上半時廿七比十七。比賽詳情如次：</p>
<p>首塲胖隊對機警，後者先行破籃，胖子發急，卽行罰中，警機機警，輕車熟道。五比一領前。十比六時，胖隊再度暫停，比賽重起，局勢漸緊凑，上半時「阿胖」叫屈，警機十八比十二前導　下半時胖隊風勢轉變，時以遠射獲分，曾一度僅差一球（十八比十六），無奈好境不常，漸又脫節，但胖隊夾袋中人物頗多，不時調動陣綫，以蘇喘息。該隊中以孫銘新爲「天字第一號」，重二百磅出頭，此公球藝亦不惡，右角揚擲，妙技穿楊，地板蓬蓬之聲，表示着五胖進攻的猛烈。一聲鐘饗，卅五比卅二，衆胖子僅輸三分。</p>

<h3>和談聲中的華南</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十七日電〕自從前年秋朱子文啣命主粵，有識人士，都會看出這廣大的華南，卽將成爲政府的政治，軍事，和經濟的重要基地，到現在，這問題便更有了明確的解答。的確，在漫天烽火中，戰爭的兇燄已逼近長江流城，祗有這邊遠的南國，却還說得上「安定」兩個字。然而，今後在她的肩膊上，所挑着那大後方的擔子，也就隨着時局的演進，而日益加重了。</p>
<p>避難南下的人流</p>
<p>在一個月以前，卽如浪潮般汹湧而來，使這寂靜的南國，添了不少熱鬧。雖然從未有人去統計過，究竟人口增加了多少，但現在無論任何一個角落，尤其在較高貴的公共塲所裏，委實到處都可聽到，那些「外江」朋友說普通話的腔調，使人幾乎以爲當局推行國語運動，竟有了這樣普遍的成績，而感到驚奇。這批南來的人士，剛踏進了廣州之門，自然都深自慶幸。但當他們住了下來，却自然就馬上會感到生活太高的威脅，因爲現在的廣州，恐怕已是全國物價最高的都市了。他們縱使帶來的是「條子」，但一根也不過祗換到幾張港幣，而這裏幾乎日常的一切開銷，都非港幣不行，這使他們不免會憧憬着：逃得了生命，也逃不了飢餓的恐怖，所以不少人乘興而來，却又有不少人敗興而返了。</p>
<p>但是，直到現在爲止，這一股股汹湧的人流還是有增無已。中央各機關的職員及眷屬，成了一列列龐大的隊伍，集體的浩浩蕩蕩的分由海陸空各路而來。自然，這批窮苦的公務員，立卽便可嘗到在「鹹龍」（粵人稱港幣名）生活下，是怎樣的味道了。而且人口越增多，港幣因需求者多，市價亦必增漲，而一切以港幣爲本位的物價，當更不知伊於胡底了。在這裏，也許有人會問：廣州是中國地方，爲什麼讓港幣這樣流通，而當局不加制止呢？這問題的確費解，然事實却就是如此。這大槪因爲法令上祇禁止外幣買賣，而沒有禁止人民持有，所以商塲上交易，雖然</p>
<p>一切以港幣交收</p>
<p>他可以說是「轉換持有」，而並非有買賣行爲，這使當局也莫奈他何吧。而且當局對於一般商塲上的貿易，似乎是主張讓他們自由發展，而不主張過於嚴厲的管制。廣州在現在，無論是日用必需，或非必需品的物資，的確不虞匱乏。不過，物價不斷高漲，却也够駭人。這在生產貧弱，供不應求的情况之下，自然是不能避免的事實。但這裏的政經政策，是不怕它高漲，祗怕它沒有，所以他能在京滬市塲最混亂的時候，廣東還總算能保持一個此較安定的同面，就是這個道理。</p>
<p>宋氏主粵年餘以來，爲人所公認最顯著的政績，就是對糧食最有辦法，這也就是他致力於物資調節的一個成果。但是，也有兩件他認爲最頭痛的事情，就是走私和治安兩個大難題。關於前者，目前也可說並不十分嚴重，近數月來，除了還有若干偷運糧食，鎢砂出口的私最以外，走私入口貨確實已經大减。這與中港緝私協定之後，雙方加强查緝，固然不無關係，但主要的恐怕還是因國內都市一般購買力低弱。洋貨來途雖多，而國內銷路飽滯，貨價自然低跌，使私梟大感不合算，而就寗願自動不幹吧了。所以這一問題，暫算吿一段落，但後者問迎，却已日形嚴重。自宋氏</p>
<p>接主穗綏署開始</p>
<p>對治安問題卽力謀加强，宋氏嗣曾起用了一班在抗戰時以善臉聞名的宿將成立了十個淸剿區，和兩個邊區的司令部。連同中央派駐粵海的海軍，和新訓練成功的一個國軍，這在兵力上說來，較前至少增加了三倍。但各區淸剿的成績，却並不如他的理想。據最近保安部向參議會的報吿：全省匪的總數有三萬二千人。縱使這數目是眞實，但較之上屆參議會所報吿的二萬九千人，證明匪並沒有因淸剿而减少，却反而祗有增多。而且就在去冬，還發生了幾個原本已投誠收編的部隊叛變：如東江有保安十一營的王國權部全營；海南島有保六團的兩個連；和最猖獗的在南路保十團陳一林部兩個營。這次還把宋氏的〔愛將」，第十淸剿區司令張君蒿（原爲稅警總團長，戰時任暫八師師長），和副司令鄧伯涵等誘騙擊斃。這誠然是給予宋氏一個莫大的打擊。</p>
<p>這問題在宋氏的認識上，是保安團隊待遇太簿，因不及國軍之一半。於是決定在不增民衆負担原則之下，將他們待遇盡量提高；最近並改發實物。目前粵省保安團隊待遇，實已較國軍爲優。同時宋氏更發現到：用兵衛民，實不如人民自衛來得有效。於是便又組織了相當龐大的人民自衛隊。</p>
<p>全省人民自衛隊</p>
<p>共已有五百個中隊，後備自衛隊則有三千餘個中隊。據統計：廣東有民槍至少在三十萬枝，如果能善爲運用，當然是一股相當强大的力量。所以他喊出了「決心保衛廣東」的口號；招集了各方面的人士，成立了地方自衛督導委會。並由曾在江北山東作戰有年的粵保安副司令黃國樑中將，擬就一個「粵省剿匪新方案」。裏面主要是利用民衆自衛力量，發動游擊計劃。宋氏在席上，曾再三表示願意虛心接納各方意見。關於這一點，却是可相信的。被認爲財政經濟專家的宋氏，大概也在這淸剿年餘當中，得到一些敎訓；知道用兵並不如他想像那麼容易。所以他曾力勸薛岳·張發奎等老將出山，自己寗願將軍權推位讓賢。</p>
<p>前些日子，各方盛傳華南五省（粵·湘·桂·贛·閩），將設立聯防機構，或謂成立五省剿總等傳說，這傳說的來因：可能係由於去冬桂閩兩省主席，及湘贛黔等省主席代表先後來穗訪晤宋氏所引起。這問題，不敢說他們完全沒有這種意思，但縱有五省聯繫之類的計劃，相信也是經濟方面較多，而軍事政治方面均甚少。因目前華南各省的首長，可能在其地方上都有着相當潛力。在目前形勢下，實不易找到一位將領，能够有</p>
<p>指揮五省的威望</p>
<p>與權力的。如屬經濟上合作的機構，如五省物資交換，交通運輸，以及穩定金融等合作，則當然有絕對的可能。因爲宋氏在華南能够眞正表現成績的，恐怕還在經濟建設方面吧。的確，宋氏蒞任而後，</p>
<p>經建的顯著進步</p>
<p>確為他的特色。如建築黃埔港；籌劃滃江水電工程；籌建燃煤狗牙洞支綫；增建糖廠及恢復廣州紙廠；積極發展交通，和興辦水利工程等，不但相當努力，而且有部份已有了具體的成效。如黃埔港工程吧，自從黃埔通廣州的公路，及碼頭，倉庫等完成之後，就在這次疏散，卽負起了很大的任務。曾經有過數百艘的大小船隻，靠泊黃埔碼頭；所有人或貨物，可以由公路很便利地運人廣州來了。而黃埔的第二期建設工程，還在積極開展着。至狗牙洞支綫，現在每日動員二萬五千工人，耗資金元廿億，將於本月底完成。究成後，那礦區估計有七千二百噸的燃煤，可以源源供應不竭。照廣東每日需煤的動力爲五百噸計算，則可供五十年至一百年。卽使北煤斷絕後，華南各省的燃煤也足够供應而有餘了。至於其餘的建設工程，現亦在積極的推進中。所以廣東如治安問題能够解決，則在經濟建設的光明路上，更能縮短了若干里程。</p>

<h3>黔省食鹽　問題嚴重</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽十二日航訊〕谷正倫主席於客歲除夕淸晨，奉總統電召專車赴渝飛京逾十日卽飛返抵筑，本報記者於其返筑後之第二日前往謁談，關於目前大局，渠因種種關係，雖所談甚少，但對於一千一百萬貴州人民所日夕焦灼，業已喧嚷閱月之食鹽問題，則道其顚末甚詳，並認爲此關係黔人生活不可一日或缺之食鹽問題，倘中樞有關當局不能早爲設法救濟，今後鹽荒影響所及，無論大局爲和爲戰，後方治安秩序，殊難逆睹。渠談稱：目前中央雖允設法，但以食鹽問題，動輒謂爲關係國家財政，兼以我國行政效率低能，此問題之澈底解決，不能不有頓於人民力量。據谷氏談稱：貴州食鹽</p>
<p>向賴川鹽供應抗戰勝利迄今，川康靈局隨時提價，黔人早已深表不滿，尤以自金圓券問世至去年十二月一日，時間不過三閱月，但鹽價卽已調整六次，高達五十三倍有奇。戰前升米斤鹽，人民無不樂道，目前食米價最高者每斗不過二十元，而黑市鹽價每斤已達二十五元，是斗米尙不能購得斤鹽，此尙指貴陽市而言，他如邊遠縣鄕，早已視食鹽爲「打牙祭」，除非婚喪慶吊或逢年過節，不敢妄想。食鹽旣爲人民生活「每天開門七件事」之一，如此奇漲，超過人民負擔力量，前途寗堪設想！</p>
<p>川康局公佈鹽賬以來，黔人對鑒局之不滿程度，更是火上加油，首先就是谷正倫本人在電話上和重慶綏署朱紹良主任大聲責斥川康局「旣不利國而又害人」，接着黔省各縣市政府與人民就一致主張</p>
<p>澈底清算鹽局鬧得不可開交。此一段期間，雖然鬧得不可開交，但鹽局因存底尙豐，人民尙可以黑市價購得鹽斤，迨到十二月底，川康鹽局突然奉電轉飭黔鹽局「暫緩放銷已稅朱出倉之官商鹽斤」於是筑市卅多藹人口，自十二月二十九日起，迄一月四日止，一週之內，遍市無一兩食鹽供應，黑市鹽每斤原先不過十一二元，此一週之內遂逐日騰漲，竟高達到二十四五元一斤，尙須「鑽門路」，才能購得。雖經省參會省政府多次急電呼籲，迅卽早日放銷，鹽局方面因中央課征鹽稅，改按從價征收，課征標準亦經第二期立法院會議通過，井鑒行銷貴州者徵百分之十，其成本每擔爲一三七元六角六分，核定每祖征收一四元，並自本年一月一日起實行。但貴陽自去年十二月一日起，井鹽每担核定價竟是五七八元七角八分，這超過立法院所通過爲一三七元六角六分是何等不情理。川康鹽局眼見得黔鹽問題不得解決，並非他們之福，而黔省決心開放粵，滇，淮等地食鹽，川鹽卽將在黔碰壁，倘不及早减價，亦屬作繭自縛。乃於一月四日放銷之後，重行決定「凡在十二月一日以前已配未領鹽斤，准照前定核價配銷辦法每担增八元四角鹽稅之後，照額繳銷」。所謂十二月一日以前核價配銷的鹽價，每担爲二三三元七角七分，鹽稅每担爲五元六角，但鹽局有個限制必須是「已配未領」，而且預繳有部份價款者纔爲有效。</p>
<p>目前川康鹽局</p>
<p>藉口鹽稅改制所規定的黔鹽價格是多少呢？規定每担爲七一六元一角四分，與黔人一閱月來所反對不已的十二月一日核價五七八元七角八分，又增加了將近兩百元，反對的結果如斯，叫黔人不設法開放粵·滇·淮鹽，如何生活得下去？谷芷倫在貴州盡量提倡種植美菸·菜籽·桐油·想藉此與廣東交換粵鹽，盡量發動在省外的立監委國大代表與供職中樞的黔籍要人和他本人配合，一致呼籲硬要中樞立飭川康鹽局核减鹽價。他認爲只要能使貴州人民由有鹽可吃，進而至於不吃貴鹽，那就是他作貴州省主席唯一可以安慰黔人之一大善舉了據谷氏語記者：黔鹽問題</p>
<p>鬧得如此其糟，原因是由於：（一）官商串通作弊，高抬價格，鹽商每請加價，有求必應。黔鹽運銷除鹽局自運自銷一部份外，餘均委託商人辦理，如鹽運商認爲成本不敷，可隨時向鹽局請求增加運價彌補，否則卽以停運相要挾，同時一面製造謠言，一面製造黑市，以遂其獲得增加運價，而又獲得黑市售鹽的雙重利潤。貴州現有的委托鹽運商計有〔中和」，「大業」，「利民」等十餘家，他們表面上只是運商，而暗中却擁有無數的銷售商作嘍囉，同時又與鹽局勾結。並且，他們本身就是豪門資本利用半官半商買空賣空的手腕，把黔人害得死去活來。如此鹽官·金融界·運銷商溝通成一系列，黔省食鹽問題當永遠不能獲得解決。（二）鹽局辦理不善，措施失當，運銷辦法落伍，不符實際。黔省每月需鹽十一萬担，以目前鹽價而論，每祖七一六元一角四分，每月共需七千八百餘萬元，全年共計約近八億金圓，如此龐大數字，私人資本，苗難勝任。黔省交通不便，由四川之自貢或　樂產塲運至貴州躉售地點，最迅速亦需四個月以上，此長時間之運轍墊本子金，負祖必巨，亦非普通商人所能爲力。</p>
<p>谷正倫及黔省有識之士對於解決食鹽問題的意見，認爲必需</p>
<p>實施下列辦法，方足以使一千一百萬黔人無貴食淡食之苦：（一）請中央將本省明令劃爲特銷區，所有鹽斤運銷，悉由國家辦理。（二）在國家未統籌辦理以前，鹽稅應改在產塲征收，由塲到岸之一段運輸由政府辦理，由岸到省之一段，准由人民自由運銷，並打破銷區制度，准人民自由購食滇淮·粵鹽·不受限制。（三）請由國家銀行低利貸款，以爲購鹽及運輸之資金。（四）採取推行數十年成效卓著之「丁寶楨宮保鹽法」大意，施行官運商銷，增設儲鹽據點，採用嚴密管制辦法。（五）本省所設之中央鹽務機構，省政府得請委派副首長參加以便調劑盈虛及管理官運商銷之一切業務。（六）電請中央嚴飭鹽局對於本省常平鹽斤運存足額，並於遇有鹽荒發生時，始行發售，平時不能與商鹽併銷。（七）請中央切實查懲勾結舞弊之鹽務官商，並公佈三十七年十二月以前已配未銷之鹽斤數字。（八）請中央體卹黔省不產食鹽，特准核减鹽價。</p>
<h3>無錫城內一兇殺案　經理太太慘死經過</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫廿二日訊〕江蘇省農民銀行無錫分行經理蔣敬齋，現住光復門內沙文井四號，本月二十日深夜十時餘，蔣與妻王素月，正臥床假寐之際，突有一陌生暴徒入內，自稱姓王，江陰人，當將其來意說明時，適有老傭出外取茶，暴徒恐其外出報警，卽抽出袖中手槍，向蔣射擊，因躱避得法，未被擊中，蔣妻王氏，擬上前勸阻，暴徒竟向其連開二槍，第二槍彈自太陽穴射入，未抵醫院卽行身死，暴徒見已肇禍，卽匆忙下樓逃逸，其時皇后戱院適値散塲，暴徒乃雜入人羣中逸去，出事後，城防指揮部立卽發出緊急警報，宣佈特別戒嚴，並派稽查隊員，趕赴出事地點，詳密偵查，終於翌日淸晨，將本案重大嫌疑犯石餘寶捕獲。</p>
<p>被害人　一頁滄桑</p>
<p>自此案發生後，因地處城內。與光復門警衛所近在咫尺，且將在戒嚴之時，竟發生此種離奇之兇殺案，故轟傳全城，據一般推測，本案內容複雜，定有別情，緣被害人王素月，現年廿八歲，原姓潘氏，係溧陽西門外人，家貧如法，當她三歲時，被乃母送給光復門外沿城脚妓女王姓爲養女，取名小金娣，（有一姊名大金娣亦爲養女）在九歲時，曾患過傷寒及外症，左足雖生壞，幸不致妨害走路風度，民國三十二年春，小金娣始逅邂上海綢業銀行職員蔣敬齋（五十餘歲）倆人一見傾心，不久卽行同居，金娣的名字便改爲「王素月」。蔣於勝利後。設法得省農民銀行錫分行經理，一帆順風。</p>
<p>嫁經理　投機出名</p>
<p>蔣王同居後，因王聰明異常，更得蔣之歡心，蔣共有妻妾三人，大的在上海，二的在蘇州，素月屈居第三，住在無錫，每日並伴着丈夫，到行辦公，侍奉左右，如遇物價波動時，她亦乘機做生意，因她能力强，手腕好，故不論米稻，麵粉，紗布，黃金等任何市塲，說起「蔣太太」，是無人不知。蔣之家庭，也由素月主持，卽以蔣家寢室言，全套粉紅傢具，其氣派之優美，無以復加，可見蔣姓家庭美滿之一斑。</p>
<p>窮妹夫　借錢肇禍</p>
<p>蔣有親　石餘賣，係前洲石家　人現居周山浜小菜塲十號，一度任職特工，故有白郞林手槍一校，現在該處提設米糧攤，生意平常，其妻岳氏，卽「大金娣」，與王爲義姊妹，二人在下嫁後，感情尙舊，且過往甚密，惟因二人所嫁之夫，貧富懸殊，一爲銀行經理，一則地痞小販，故石時至蔣處借錢，半月前，曾借得白米一石，金圓一千元，石以不敷所費，乃書就恐嚇信一封寄蔣，內稱：平日帮了你很多的忙，且協助你太太賺了許多錢，應該借些錢來，否則親自到你家算賬。詞多威脅，當時蔣未理會，自血案發生後，稽查隊認爲石有重大嫌疑，卽派員予以拘捕，對於正兇，不難根據此綫索而獲得也。</p>
<h3>蓉城一件近事　府會衝突尖銳</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　周學端</p>
<p>〔本報成都廿一日航訊〕舊曆年關，在內陸都市的成都，農節年意，遠比國曆新正濃厚，這幾天家家桃符換歲，鞭炮迎新，和平浪潮，點綴「昇平」景象。戰火雖然遼遠，但一般人關切和平，正不亞於接近戰區的同胞，十年亂　，民亦勞止，加以物價漲風，隨舊年以俱來，生活在重壓下，望治之心，倍增熱切。</p>
<p>在和平氣氛裏，不幸由於成都市政府與市參議會的不和，引起充滿火藥味的府會之爭。原來成都市長喬誠，在四川官塲中本屬「新貴」，市參議會則頗多社會「聞人」與「名流」，在參議員心目中，喬市長是少年倖進，夤緣高位，根本上卽有瞧不起的潛因。加以喬氏履任近年，措施頗多失當，對市政一籌莫展，尤其因市財政無法解決，致員工待遇與市政建設，最受一般詬病，衝突之因，由來已久。上次市參會大會，爲喬氏兼我捐處長涉及「貪汚」問題，參會一致通過，向省府檢舉喬氏六大罪證：（一）升髦法令，（二）違法征收國民身份證工本費，（三）違法收款，乘機牟利，（四）盜賣公糧，（五）違法征收兒童福利金。（六）舉措乘謬。除分函省府川康監委行署檢舉外，並由正副議長面謁王陵基主席，請予撤職查辦。但時逾數月，省府並未追究，而喬市長亦我行我素，抱定「笑罵由他笑罵，好官我自爲之」的黃老之術相對付，因之更激起全體參議員極良不滿。該會於日前召開十二次大會，除舉行開幕禮及通電擁護和平外，卽正式宣吿休會，以示與市長誓不兩立，非達到撤換喬氏目的決不復會。次日，市府高級職員，爲示抗議參會行動，亦自動集體辭職，形式演變，在喬市長認爲「私人意氣」，參議會認爲「議會尊嚴」，省府認爲「不合法理」，老百姓認爲「一塲笑劇」。到今天，變方僵持更趨尖銳。有人認爲府會衝突，可能引起四川政海波濟，發展如何，尙有待下回分解。</p>

<p>〔又訊〕記者頃往距屯三華里之東原故里（隆阜）訪晤在里養疴之皖省參會議長江彤侯，叩詢對於和平問題觀感，及安徽大江南北今後之動向。渠對此問籌思良久，徐徐答以「和難戰也難，但和平始能挽轉人民生機，故云戰不如和。」江氏爲皖南歙縣籍，曾因文名揚溢，才學精湛，被稱爲江南才子，與胡適之早年過往甚薦，而胡之故鄕績溪爲歙邑鄰縣。又皖南社會人士，認爲戰事不能再拖，近將有一具體意見共同公開表示。</p>

<h3>農業示範在浙江</h3>
<p>— 本報記者蔣風</p>
<p>〔本報金華廿二日訊〕在去年秋間，聯合國糧長農業組看中了浙江，計劃協同農林部和浙江省政府把浙江建設起一個農業示範省。於是浙江省農業推廣委員會就在這種需要之下成立，委員七人，另外在委員會之下成立一個督導處，作爲事業執行機構，經過許多專家們之研討，才在杭·嘉·湖·寗·紹·金等地區選定杭縣等二十五縣爲示範區，並以金華爲中心。步驟討論得很妥切，計劃也擬得很周密，後來却爲了經費發生問題，計劃也就大部分「吿吹」，不可鑼鼓敲響了，不得不做，於是把示範區减少，只留蕭山·海寧·餘杭·杭州三縣一市辦理。自九月初開始，各縣都在縣財政極度困難之情况下增籌經費，添設技術人負，散處在田間或鄕村實地工作。</p>
<p>四個月來，上列三縣一市的示範區，舉辦了下列工作：</p>
<p>（一）水稻保純。各縣歷年推廣純系稻種，漸呈雜劣，示範區成立之後，發動各縣市加强指導農民從事田間保純工作，實行去偽去劣，共計六三〇畝。經實施後，純度提高至百分之九十五以上，擬供下年特約繁殖原種之用。</p>
<p>（二）小麥推廣：小麥推廣工作係配合浙省糧食增產計劃進行，推廣面積一七四五〇畝。</p>
<p>（三）菸草改良：蕭山引種美菸佛光種五十畝，並籌設小型烤菸房，以資改良示範。</p>
<p>（四）黃蔴保純：海寗曾推廣印度蔴二萬五千畝，但因其種子頗有混雜，指導其推行種子保純二十畝。</p>
<p>（五）蔬菜病蟲防治：杭州市辦理蔬菜病蟲害防治，介紹使用噴霧器，指導施用魚藤粉，砒酸鉛，DDT等藥劑二三七斤，並劃定中心地點二一三畝爲洽蟲示範區，鄕人頗多倣效實行者。</p>
<p>（六）提倡改良羊舍：海寗農家普遍飼羊，爲重要農家副業，近就農家羊舍建築，略加改良，便於通風排泄，已在袁化鄕特約農家建造示範改良羊舍一座，以資提倡。</p>
<p>（七）提倡農田水利：輔導蕭山濬墾湘湖，現正作第一期築堤抽水工程。海寗農民團體購用抽水機五架，並發動義務勞動疎濬河港。</p>
<p>（八）舉辦農民講習班：爲利用農閑，灌輸實用技能，提高農民改進農事興趣起見，自十一月下旬起，各示範區舉辦各種農業生活講習班，爲期五天至七天，共計七處，參加靑年農民共二七四人。</p>
<p>農業示範區之試辦，在國內尙係首創，雖然短短四個月內，已能做了不少工作，但是成績之表現，尙不能令人滿意。</p>
<p>根據過去的經騐，檢討幾個月來推廣工作之得失，浙江省農業推廣委員會督導處特擬定五項原則，作爲今後工作之依據。</p>
<p>（一）業務設計應以農民整個生活爲對象，向多方面推進，以適合農民之興趣與需要，不僅限於技術上之改良。</p>
<p>（二）實施地區與對象必須集中，以農業推廣爲中心與起點，視當地環境，配合水利·地政·敎育·衛生·組訓及農貸等設施，以宏成效。</p>
<p>（三）農業推廣爲一種敎育性之服務工作旣非慈善事業，亦非例行公事，應少用由上而下之行政力量，多用敎導方法，啓發農民改進意識。</p>
<p>（四）農村建設應以農民爲主體，應培養農民自動之興趣與能力，以發揮農民之潛力，達成自力更生之目的。</p>
<p>（五）農業建設工作爲一切施政之基礎，基礎穩固後，則一經輔導改進，卽能在當地生根。農村領袖之培植與訓練，縣鄕自治團體之加强，均應特別注意。</p>
<p>千萬農民正等待着種植在浙江沃土上的這朶「農業推廣示範之花」，早些結出果實來。</p>

<h3>The National Army Withdraws Near the Final Defense Line, Hoping the Communist Side Will Immediately Cease Advancing and Quickly Send Representatives to Discuss Peace</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Military observers here on the 24th solemnly pointed out that the continuous withdrawal of the National Army in the Jinan section and areas north of the Yangtze River is because the government advocates peace and aims to promote a swift ceasefire and reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Therefore, unnecessary strongholds are being evacuated by the National Army one by one to reduce unnecessary losses. However, the government's intention is to seek peace, not surrender. Such measures to avoid unnecessary conflict also have their limits. The Yangtze River is the National Army's final defense line. To protect Jiangnan, the National Army must retain some strongholds north of the river. As of the evening of the 24th, the National Army had withdrawn to areas near the final defense line. If the communists continue to advance, war will likely be unavoidable. Since the Executive Yuan's resolution on the 19th to suggest a ceasefire and reconciliation, the government has, in fact, taken ceasefire measures and has already appointed representatives to prepare for peace talks with the Communist side. Although the Communist side insists that peace talks need not stipulate ceasefire conditions beforehand, we have now made the greatest effort to promote peace. It is hoped that the Communist army will immediately cease advancing and use the areas from which the National Army has withdrawn as a buffer zone, and quickly send representatives to negotiate. Then, peace can be achieved quickly.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] In the past week, the National Army has been withdrawing south daily, possibly completely realizing the situation of facing each other across the river, defending the Yangtze and not defending the Huai, before the Lunar New Year's Eve. Although the mood of the capital's residents is heavy, everyone hopes that this "period of transitional suffering" will pass as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] The Capital Garrison Headquarters, considering that the Communist army north of the Yangtze River is approaching the Yangtze River, has specially established a Shipping Control Office to control all types of ships along the river between Wuhu and Zhenjiang. Deng Yunyi has been appointed as the director, and the office will start working in Xiaguan today.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nantong, 24th Dispatch] To ensure safety, the Nantong County government has established a Jiangnan Office in the Liu Hai district on the south bank of the Yangtze River. In addition, the local garrison authorities have mobilized civilians to build city defenses.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] According to unconfirmed reports, Acting President Li has today transferred 50,000 men from Chongxi's command here, presumably to prevent the National Army from violating future ceasefire agreements or, in the event of a Communist offensive, to protect the capital.</p>
<h3>Southern Section of the Jinpu Railway Front: The Two Armies Face Each Other Across the Chu River; Yangzhou is Fortified, and the Situation in Yizheng is Improving</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Puzhen, 24th Dispatch] To implement the established policy of ensuring Jiangnan, the National Army, except for some bridgeheads in the north of the Yangtze River, continues to withdraw south according to the planned schedule. Therefore, there have been few major contacts on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway front, the Huainan Road, and the Huaiyang Highway in recent days. Among them, the Chu County area of ​​the Jinpu Railway is responsible for covering the retreat south from Danzi Station. At noon on the 24th, this unit encountered a part of the Communist 12th Column and the Jianghuai Military Region Independent Brigade five miles north of Niaoyi, repelled them, and then retreated to the south of Dongge, forming a confrontation with the Communist army across the Chu River. In addition, after more than 10,000 Communist troops entered Chu County, they advanced towards Quanjiao via Meijiapu and Yaopu at 2:00 PM on the 24th. The National Army Hu Changqing's troops have given a strong resistance, and the battle is still going on outside the city. As for Liuhe, the National Army voluntarily abandoned it on the afternoon of the 23rd. As for Yangzhou, when a long-distance call was made to the city at 2:30 PM on the 24th, it was still fortified by two regiments of the National Army's regular army and one regiment of local troops. In addition to contact with thousands of local communists, the main force of the two Communist columns has not yet participated in the battle.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] The Communist army that entered Liuhe was the 12th Column of Chen Yi's forces. Chen Yi's 10th, 11th, and 12th Columns also gathered northeast of Yangzhou on the 24th and engaged in fierce fighting with our army. Until 7:00 PM, Yangzhou was still in the hands of our army. The National Army on the Chu County front has now withdrawn south, retreating to the south of the Chu River. Hexian is still being built into a bridgehead north of the Yangtze River by the local security regiment and has not been abandoned.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 24th Dispatch] After the National Army transferred from Wanfu Bridge, fifteen miles east of Yangzhou, on the 23rd, the rail bridge was blown up. After our reinforcements arrived in Yizheng on the 24th, the situation improved.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Leaders of the China Democratic League Express Views on the Current Situation</h3>

<h3>The President Quietly Resides in His Hometown, Enjoying Family Happiness; He Plans to Prepare a New Year's Eve Dinner with His Clan on New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xikou, 24th Dispatch] After President Chiang retired and returned to his hometown, he quietly resided at the mausoleum of his mother, Mrs. Chiang, without receiving any guests. He spent his days with his family, including Chiang Ching-kuo and his wife, as well as grandchildren, enjoying family happiness. The President took a walk near the mausoleum this morning, enjoying the scenery and appearing very happy. The President has participated in the revolution for several decades, working tirelessly, and has never returned to his hometown for the New Year. This time, he retired and returned to his hometown for a quiet residence, coinciding with the end of the year. He specifically planned to prepare a New Year's Eve dinner at the old residence of Fenghao House, to enjoy a chat with his clan. The local elders and members of the Chiang clan also consider it rare for the President to return to his hometown for the New Year and are preparing to perform operas and welcome lights during the Spring Festival to express their sincere welcome.</p>
<h3>Li Jishen and Others' Statement Does Not Hinder Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Since Li Jishen, Shen Junru, and 53 others issued their opinions on the current situation, people in society have held pessimistic views on the prospects for peace talks. Yesterday, the reporter specifically inquired about the significance of this matter with Gan Jiehou. According to Gan, the results of research with various parties all believe that this declaration was written before Mr. Chiang's retirement, so it only mentioned the New Year's Day proclamation, and did not mention the situation after his retirement. Therefore, it is believed that the publication of this declaration does not hinder the progress of peace talks. Gan also believes that although the Communist offensive has not stopped, military actions will actually cease once peace talks begin. The reporter then asked whether the Peiping ceasefire agreement could be a microcosm of a future peace agreement. Gan believes that this is unlikely, because the former is local, and the latter is comprehensive, so they cannot be compared. The conditions of the Communists cannot exceed the eight points they have proposed, and the government will also put forward proposals, and the eight points are the basis for negotiations, which does not mean full acceptance.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Acting President Li held a tea party on the 24th to receive diplomatic envoys from various countries.

<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 24th, 6:55 PM Dispatch] After the Peiping peace agreement was signed, the issue of "war criminals" still attracted attention. According to an important official source, the war criminals issue will disappear after the state of war no longer exists.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 24th Dispatch] The National Army's withdrawal work was completed last night. According to the ceasefire agreement, only a part remains to guard warehouses or assist the police. There is currently a regiment of the Communist army in the city without flags. Its main task is to protect Communist officials. The handover is proceeding smoothly. The Communist representative of the Joint Office is temporarily represented by Xue Zizheng, Ye Jianying's chief of staff. The government representative is Fu Zuoyi. The Office has ordered that civilian aircraft be prohibited from entering or leaving, and several government air force planes are also under its jurisdiction. It is hoped that rail transport between Peiping and Tianjin will return to normal within days. Except that it is necessary to find ways to cross several bombed bridges along the way, it is not difficult for any traveler to travel directly from Peiping to Harbin. According to the Communist authorities, the section of the Ping Sui Railway from Peiping to Zhangjiakou has been repaired and is expected to open to traffic soon.

<h3>Acting President Li Telegraphed Yesterday, Inviting Gu Mengyu and Others to Visit Nanjing</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Minister of Water Conservancy Zhong Tianxin, having been appointed as a representative for peace talks, has had his request approved by the Executive Yuan to have the affairs of the Ministry of Water Conservancy delegated to Vice Minister Wang Peiren.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Officials here, from Acting President Li down, have apparently accepted the status of a defeated party in spirit and are willing to pay any price for peace short of unconditional surrender. Their greatest hope is to gain equal status with the Communist Party in a coalition government, but if a ceasefire agreement similar to that in Peiping is acceptable for the entire solution, it would not be surprising if the government's peace initiators agree to a minority party status in a coalition government. Many believe that this is very possible because the "honorable peace" advocated by President Sun Ke in the highest-level discussions has been transformed into "peace on the best possible terms."</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Government officials announced on the 24th that although the Communist telegrams continue to attack the Nanjing government, it is expected that the Communist Party will accept the peace proposal. According to unconfirmed reports, the CCP has designated Peiping as the site for peace talks and has appointed Zhou Enlai as the chief representative of the Communist side.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 24th, 7:30 PM Dispatch] The arrested CCP personnel who were previously concentrated in the Qingxun Team have now been released on bail.</p>

The original text stated: Recently, the People's Liberation Army and General Fu Zuoyi reached an agreement to achieve local peace. The people of the three parties in Peiping were liberated. It is heard that the release of political prisoners was listed as one of the terms of the agreement. However, it is found that most of those who are imprisoned for political cases are still groaning under iron bars and living inhuman lives. Speaking of this, how can we bear our grief?

<h3>The Beginning of Cooperation Among Asian Peoples</h3>
<p>The conference of nineteen Asian nations, which opened in New Delhi on the 20th, successfully concluded on the 23rd. Although the conference period was brief, it completed its initial task and achieved a good start for the self-help and mutual assistance of Asian countries. As Indian Prime Minister Nehru, the initiator of the Asian Conference, said, "This Asian Conference is indeed the forerunner of a new era of cooperation among the peoples of the Far East."</p>
<p>Summarizing the themes discussed at this Asian conference, they are nothing more than the following two: one is the new situation caused by the Dutch invasion of Indonesia and the countermeasures to be taken, as proposed by Indian Prime Minister Nehru; and the other is the Asian regional security mechanism proposed by Philippine representative Romulo. During the four days of the conference, representatives from the nineteen countries expressed their opinions one after another. Because of the consistency of their positions and the similarity of their interests, no disputes occurred, and agreements were reached through consultation, which is a rare phenomenon in any international conference.</p>
<p>Regarding the resurgence of the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, although world opinion has unanimously condemned the Dutch atrocities against Indonesia, and the United Nations Security Council has also demanded that the Netherlands immediately cease its military operations; however, the Dutch authorities have consistently refused to abandon their "colonialism" towards Indonesia, and still want to carry out their imperialist policies under the smoke screen of "anti-communism," blatantly ignoring the accusations of world opinion and the resolutions of the Security Council. If the relevant Asian countries stand idly by and do not take "effective action," it will be difficult to see a thorough resolution of the Dutch-Indonesian issue. Indian Prime Minister Nehru, angered by the Dutch tyranny in Indonesia, and also to save the crisis in Southeast Asia, specifically initiated the convening of a conference of nineteen Asian countries, in order to assist the United Nations Security Council in resolving this issue through self-help and mutual assistance. In Nehru's initial proposal, he put forward two steps to resolve the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. The initial goal was to restore the Republic of Indonesia to the state before the Dutch army attacked Yogyakarta, so that the country could negotiate with the Netherlands in the position of a free government. The second step was to eradicate colonialism by other countries in Asia, so that all countries in the world would know that Asia would never tolerate other countries interfering with its freedom. However, in the eyes of the Indonesian representatives, Nehru's proposal was still too slow, so they demanded that Asian countries impose effective sanctions on the Netherlands to force the Netherlands to withdraw from Indonesia. The final result of the discussion was a decision to recommend that the United Nations Security Council demand that the Netherlands end its rule over Indonesia, and to condemn the Dutch military actions against Indonesia as nothing less than a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and a threat to peace in Southeast Asia and the entire world.</p>
<p>In addition to this general resolution, ten specific measures were also decided: (1) The Netherlands should immediately release all Indonesian political leaders; (2) The Republic of Indonesia should restore its jurisdiction over Java, Sumatra, and other regions before March 15; (3) Yogyakarta should be restored as the capital of the Republic of Indonesia; (4) Indonesian people should be allowed freedom of movement throughout the country; (5) The Netherlands should completely withdraw from the occupied areas under foreign supervision before March 15; (6) All trade restrictions should be lifted, and Indonesian people should be allowed to freely interact with all countries in the world; (7) The Indonesian provisional government should be formed before March 15; (8) All troops should be under the jurisdiction of the provisional government, and the Dutch army should withdraw from the entire East Indies on a designated date; (9) The work of convening a constitutional assembly should be completed before November 1; (10) Sovereignty should be transferred to the Indonesian government on January 1 of next year. These ten measures are thorough and comprehensive, and it is hoped that Asian countries will work together to promote their realization one by one; moreover, whether these ten measures can be fully achieved is also a major test of whether Asian countries can cooperate and help each other.</p>
<p>In terms of a permanent regional security mechanism in Asia, the high-pitched advocacy of an Asian alliance today has its profound meaning. Although this Asian conference did not have a concrete resolution, it only agreed to request the governments of the participating countries to study the possibility of organizing a regional security mechanism for Asian countries within the framework of the United Nations; however, the awakening of the Asian people and their desire for unity have formed an irresistible mainstream in the New Delhi Conference, making it impossible for any world power to ignore. When Philippine representative Romulo spoke, mentioning that "after centuries of bondage, Asia is now casting off its chains and striving for its new freedom and power, let us work together to help Asia obtain the rightful place it deserves in the new world," he received warm applause from the entire audience. This call from New Delhi is indeed the harbinger of the arrival of the Asian century, worthy of the attention of the great powers. Even more worthy of our cherishing!</p>

<h3>Hoffman to Meet Acheson to Request Instructions on Aid to China; U.S. Government Action Hinges on Outcome of KMT-CCP Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman announced today that he will ask Secretary of State Acheson for instructions on future aid to China, likely this week. This move has been agreed to by Acheson. Unless the State Department formulates a new China policy, the Economic Cooperation Administration will not change its current $275 million aid to China plan. However, the U.S. government's actions largely depend on the outcome of the peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, with the following three possibilities: (1) If the KMT and the CCP divide the north and south, continue to aid the government-controlled areas. (2) Negotiate with the future Communist government or a government partially communist, but this move must be approved by the State Department. (3) Completely stop aid to China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] According to the general opinion here, China will be the most difficult problem for the new U.S. Secretary of State Acheson.

<h3>Talking about Fuzhou Amidst Evacuation</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zheng Shizhu</p>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch by Air Mail on the 21st] In the early stages of the evacuation, people's attention was focused on the beautiful island of Taiwan. But as the evacuation neared its end, tens of thousands of people surged in, and this provincial capital on the edge of the sea greeted them with a mixture of surprise and joy.</p>
<p>The Navy came, the Air Force came, the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters was abolished, but the Fuzhou Pacification Headquarters was established. The number of officials often did not match the number of their family members, so the Air Force Supply Division and the Ground Service Squadron, plus their families, amounted to about 4,000 people. Many of the officers and soldiers serving in the Navy were from Fuzhou, and the number of their families returning to Fuzhou was certainly more than that. Together with others evacuated from various places through various connections and by various public and private means of transportation, it is estimated that the population of Fuzhou City and its suburbs has increased by at least 40,000 in the recent period. Fuzhou's population is said to be 300,000, which has increased by one-seventh. More conspicuously, most of these additional people are non-producers, but their purchasing power is stronger than that of the average local. In the past half month, Fuzhou's sea, land, and air transportation has been more frequent and larger in scale than ever before, with as many as 24 special planes landing in one day and as many as 80 small naval vessels entering port at one time. At present, various evacuation agencies are still arriving in Fuzhou one after another, and the population is still increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>In the past half month, commodity prices have stirred up a huge storm. The price of rice once shouted to 3,000 yuan on the 16th, a 12-fold increase in ten days, which is particularly daunting. The price of pork rose from 30 yuan per catty to 96 yuan in ten days, and the citizens looked at each other in dismay as the Lunar New Year approached. This round of price increases was led by rice, which instantly surpassed Beijing and Shanghai. It is said that it was impacted by the influx of speculative capital from the south, especially the hoarding of rice, which was the main stimulus. Amidst the sharp rise in prices, there was even a situation similar to panic buying. Nine out of ten oil markets were empty, and the oil tanks were as clean as if they had been washed. Even if there were some reserves, they were unwilling to sell them in large quantities. After the news of peace spread, although the prices of various goods fell slightly, people were still mostly waiting and watching.</p>

MacArthur said: "I am deeply grateful for the gathering of my compatriots to celebrate my humble birthday, which shows the depth of friendship and love. At the same time, it also shows the determination of the American people to promote Americanism, which has been harmed by enemies at home and abroad, who have caused unrest and turmoil through misunderstanding and deception in order to undermine the traditional unity of the American people. Standing at an outpost far from the American coast, seeing that the Asian continent is being threatened by communism, I am given a lot of strength and courage by the trust and support of my compatriots. Although I cannot estimate the military strength, I dare to guarantee that this outpost of democracy and freedom will never succumb to the political or social pressure of communism or any other enslaving ideology, no matter how the situation on the neighboring continent changes."</p>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd Dispatch] Sources close to the US delegation said today that the resolution on the Dutch-Indonesian issue submitted by the Southeast Asian Conference to the United Nations Security Council has strengthened the Security Council's position in dealing with the issue. But a group of countries with great potential should take more severe action, and the resolution seems to be too moderate. It is expected that when the Security Council resumes its discussion of the Indonesian issue tomorrow, the delegations of several countries, encouraged by the Asian Conference, will submit amendments to the joint proposal of China, the United States, Norway, and Cuba. However, any tough amendment is unlikely to obtain the necessary majority.</p>

<h3>The Iranian Government Feels Uneasy About the Turbulent Situation in China: Believes it May Become "China's Second" in the Future</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 23rd Dispatch] The retreat of China's President Chiang has caused unease in government circles here, as communism is expanding day by day. It is unknown to what extent the countries on the continent can rely on US aid, and what attitude the United States will take if Iran is in the same situation as China. The semi-official newspaper "Tehran Daily" commented today on the possibility of the Communist Party directly threatening Iran, saying that government circles are now divided into two factions on the issue of US opposition to the expansion of communism. One faction believes that the US government is now shortening the anti-Soviet front, but is also preparing to defend the Middle East, which is most evident in the policies pursued by the United States in Turkey and Palestine. The other faction holds a skeptical attitude and is awaiting the return of the US Ambassador to Iran, Wiley, before deciding on its opinion. The newspaper also said that the development of the situation in China is the Soviet Union's most significant victory, and Iran may become "China's Second" in the future. Finally, it said that what distinguishes Iran from China is that all provinces of Iran are directly under the central government. The changes in China are sufficient to support the general trend of the Iranian government, namely, maintaining a good neighbor policy, promoting internal reforms, and trusting the United Nations organization.</p>
<h3>The French Government Announces De Facto Recognition of Israel; Britain, Australia, and New Zealand Will Also Recognize it One After Another</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 24th Broadcast: Paris News: After several consultations between the French government and Fischer, the chief representative of Israel in France, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a communique today formally announcing its decision to recognize the Israeli government de facto.

Britain is already discussing the recognition of Israel with Australia and New Zealand. Australia and New Zealand have indicated that they will follow suit once Britain recognizes Israel. At the same time, France may also follow Britain in recognizing Israel. Political circles suggest that Britain will likely announce it before the 25th, as this move will benefit the conservative elements in Israel.</p>

<h3>Acheson Begins Work: Is Personally Planning the North Atlantic Defense Treaty; It is Reported that Acheson Will Soon Consult with Various Countries</h3>
<p>[US Information Agency, Washington, 22nd Dispatch] Secretary of State Acheson began work early this morning at his desk. He acknowledged that this work would entail great responsibility. When the new Secretary of State was asked to make a statement in a newsreel, he said: "I have been instructed by the President, and I know that the task is arduous and the responsibility is heavy. I vow to fulfill these responsibilities with loyalty."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] Well-informed diplomatic sources predicted on the 23rd that the new Secretary of State Acheson will immediately take over as the US representative for the negotiation of the North Atlantic Security Alliance. Acheson has already received the documents of the plan from State Department officials and is expected to proceed with this matter first. The plan will unite the United States, Canada, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg into an alliance to prevent aggression - in fact, to protect Western Europe from aggression by the Soviet Union and its satellite countries. As drafted, the plan stipulates that signatory countries should consult promptly on the definition of aggression or the threat of war. The US Congress will retain the right to decide what action the United States should take. This provision reaffirms that the US Congress alone has the power to declare war, and is intended to alleviate the concerns of some senators and representatives who have vehemently opposed the treaty until this guarantee is given. The treaty will require the approval of the US Senate and may be submitted to the Senate on February 15. It is rumored that Acheson and other foreign ministers of the signatory countries will hold a meeting soon to sign the treaty. The meeting may be held in Bermuda.</p>

<h3>British Newspaper Comments on the New Delhi Conference: Believes That the Netherlands' Plan to Establish a Federal Government in Indonesia is a Wise Move. The Suspicions of All Parties Towards the Netherlands Will Eventually Be Eliminated.</h3>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 23rd Dispatch] The British Times wrote an evaluation on the New Delhi Conference today, stating: "When representatives of 19 countries met in New Delhi to consider the Dutch actions in Indonesia, Nehru made a cautious statement in his opening speech, saying that the purpose of the meeting was to strengthen the Security Council's strength, rather than to establish a hostile Asian group to protect Asian interests. The countries participating in the meeting, from Egypt and Ethiopia in the west to Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines in the east, as Australian Foreign Minister Evatt called it, all felt a desire to see the Security Council's orders obeyed by Indonesia, and throughout Southeast Asia, relations between Western countries and the nationalism that is unfolding among Asian people should be promoted by the United Nations Charter rather than by older ideas of racial dominance. "It is remarkable that the countries of the Eastern Hemisphere, regardless of their different cultural and economic backgrounds, can work together closely to support the ideals set forth in the United Nations Charter. The participation of all five British dominions of different natures—New Zealand, Australia, India, Pakistan, and Ceylon—undoubtedly strengthens the belief in the meeting that this kind of cooperation is possible. All indications have shown that the current crisis in Indonesia may change the entire Southeast Asia, as this crisis can make the Asian people believe that racial ties are not as important as ideals, and that the true foundation of international cooperation is the principle of freedom and justice." "Since the majority of countries at the New Delhi Conference considered the Netherlands' actions in the Dutch East Indies to be close to the use of force to suppress legitimate nationalist movements, it is hardly surprising that the Dutch government was severely attacked at the meeting. However, the Security Council's accusations against the Netherlands should not be regarded as a complete endorsement of the Indonesian Republic. The views of the Republic have been fully elucidated by many representatives at the New Delhi Conference, but the Dutch side, although there are sufficient reasons, seems to have failed due to the lack of defense. Before the Dutch government attacked the Indonesian Republic, the Security Council had begun to recognize that Indonesian nationalism was not a simple issue between the wishes of the Republic and Dutch "colonialism." There are several powerful groups in the Dutch East Indies who, while recognizing the Republic as their comrades, are unwilling to recognize it as their master. The Dutch government's plan for an Indonesian Federal Government is a wise move. In this plan, the Republic can have its appropriate place, but it cannot exceed this place. Unfortunately, the Dutch government's attack on the Republic has caused deep suspicion of the Dutch government's intentions, and this suspicion will not be dispelled until the new federal government takes effect."</p>

<h3>Arrests of Teachers and Students in the City; University Association Demands Release; Presidents of Thirteen Schools Scheduled to Visit Garrison Commander Today; Two Jiaotong University Professors Granted Bail Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai University and College Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Tsinghua Alumni Association. Those in attendance included Wang Zhizhuo from Jiaotong University, Zhang Yi from Fudan University, Ou Yuanhuai from Great China University, Zhu Guozhang from Shanghai Business College, Hu Wenyao from Shanghai Zhen旦 College, Ling Xianyin from Shanghai University, Zhao Xiuhong from St. John's University, Sheng Zhenwei from Soochow University, Chu Fengyi from Shanghai Law College, and Wang Yukai from Guangxia Commercial College, totaling over forty people. Zhang Yi presided over the meeting. There were three important proposals discussed during the meeting: (1) Eighteen students from various schools arrested last autumn are still being held in custody. It has been five months, and they have neither been prosecuted nor released. Recently, there have been incidents of illegal arrests of teachers and students from various schools. The arresting officers did not have warrants from the Special Criminal Court, which is a violation of personal freedom and detrimental to the dignity of academic institutions. In order to uphold justice and maintain the dignity of national law, in addition to sending letters to the Municipal Government, the Garrison Headquarters, and the Special Criminal Court, it was decided that the presidents of thirteen schools, including Jiaotong University, Fudan University, St. John's University, Great China University, Guanghua University, New China Law and Commerce College, Shanghai University, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Zhen旦 College, Shanghai Business College, Tongji University, Datong University, and China Industrial and Commercial College, would jointly visit Garrison Commander Chen Daqing this morning to demand the immediate release of teachers and students arrested in the past without legal procedures and the eighteen students currently in custody. Furthermore, they would demand that there be no arbitrary and illegal arrests of teachers and students in the future, but this proposal was not approved. (2) During the winter vacation, military troops were stationed at Guanghua University, Shanghai Law College, Municipal Industrial College, Teachers College, Physical Education College, and New China Law and Commerce College, which affected the opening of the next semester. It was decided that the school presidents would raise this issue during their visit to Garrison Commander Chen Daqing this morning and urge the withdrawal of the troops. (3) Over thirty Tsinghua University students who came to Shanghai have organized a Southward Student Association. Because their hope of returning to school and resuming their studies next semester is slim, they are requesting that major universities and colleges in Shanghai provide them with opportunities to audit classes. After discussion, the meeting decided that the University and College Association would send letters to all member schools, asking them to provide as much convenience as possible for students from Peiping and Tianjin to audit classes based on each school's situation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Weiji, the director of the Textile Department of Jiaotong University, and Professor Su Yanbin, who had been arrested, were granted bail yesterday afternoon by the school authorities in conjunction with the China Textile Corporation to the Garrison Headquarters. Another arrested student from the school, Yan Zushou, has also been released.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chen Siwei, an English professor at China Industrial and Commercial College, has been detained for several months, and despite repeated requests from the school for bail, he remains in custody.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Professors' Association Resolves to Lodge Protest with the Government</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jiaotong University Professors' Association held an expanded board meeting yesterday afternoon. Regarding the arrest of Professors Chen and Su from the school, despite their release on bail, they expressed deep indignation that such a violation of human rights occurred in this peaceful atmosphere and decided to lodge a protest with the government. In addition, regarding the contingency measures, it was decided to suggest that the school establish a university-wide contingency organization, consisting of representatives from six units: the school authorities, the Professors' Association, the Lecturers and Assistants Association, the Staff Advancement Association, the Student Self-Government Association, and the Labor-Police Association, with one to three representatives from each unit. The three months of contingency funds that the Ministry of Education previously promised to allocate to each school have not yet been issued, and they urged the school to expedite the allocation from the Ministry of Education. Regarding the relocation of the school, the Professors' Association had previously advocated against it, and the school authorities have not yet received an order to do so. Therefore, they will not consider external rumors. Regarding the request to adjust salaries, the Professors' Association had previously sent a telegram calling for action, but there has been no response to date. It was decided to suggest that the school contact other national universities and colleges in the city to vigorously fight for the adjustment of salaries in accordance with the methods previously drafted by the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>Tang Enbo Issues Statement to Reporters; Local Security Maintained as Usual; Those Disrupting Order and Transportation Will Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] General Tang Enbo, the Commander-in-Chief of the Jinghu-Hang Garrison, received reporters at the Garrison Headquarters at 10:00 AM yesterday and issued several important statements: (1) Since the peace talks began, opinions from all sides have been quite inconsistent. I absolutely support peace, but peace talks are a matter for the government. As a local official, I have the responsibility to maintain local order and security. While the Communist Party continues its advance and the peace talks have not yet succeeded, everything will continue as usual. (2) Anyone who disrupts local security or damages local order and transportation, regardless of who they are, will be severely punished according to military law. (3) I do not oppose the release of political prisoners and the opening of freedom of speech, but I believe that the timing of implementation must be studied. I advocate that the release of political prisoners and the opening of freedom of speech should wait until the Communist army stops its offensive or until the peace talks succeed and a ceasefire is achieved. If the Communist army continues its offensive and the peace talks are not effective, it will absolutely not be possible. Even if the central government orders implementation, I will consider it at that time.</p>
<h3>Answering Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>Tang also answered reporters' questions as follows: (1) Before peace is achieved, local garrison work and city defense works will continue as usual. (2) In his view, the Communist Party will not stop its offensive against Nanjing and Shanghai. (3) Tang's jurisdiction includes Jinghu-Hang and parts of Zhejiang and Anhui. He declined to disclose the strength of his troops. (4) The progress of the peace talks has some impact on the morale of the soldiers, but he believes it is not very serious, because "when the enemy is attacking us, we have no choice but to fight." (5) The treatment of soldiers in the Jinghu area has improved since this month, with an additional two catties of meat and two catties of oil issued each month. (6) He had not heard of foreign reports that parts of Bai Chongxi's troops in Central China and Hu Zongnan's troops in North China had been transferred to the Jinghu area. (7) According to what he knows, there are about a dozen columns of Communist troops on the Nanjing front. The Yangzhou area is not suitable for combat, and the defense there will focus on river defense.</p>
<h3>Inspects Troops and Returns to Nanjing That Evening</h3>
<p>Tang met with General Sun Liren yesterday morning, inspected the city's troops in the afternoon, and returned to Nanjing that evening. [Another Report] Chen Daqing, the Garrison Commander of Jinghu, added two points after Tang Enbo's reception of reporters: (1) The current stage is one of talk and war, and there is still a considerable distance to peace. Since the Communist Party continues the war, those who are soldiers should continue to prepare for war. (2) Regardless of talk, war, or peace, local order and security must be maintained.</p>

<h3>Banks Are Unwilling to Undertake Industrial Loans; Municipal Industrial Association Suggests Charging a Handling Fee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In recent months, usury has prevailed, affecting industrial loans. The banks that handle the loans believe that the interest rate on industrial loans is too low. Even if it is calculated according to the Central Bank's re-pledge method, the total monthly interest rate is only 60%. The interest is not as good as interbank lending, so most of them are unwilling to undertake the loans, and factories cannot obtain loans. The Municipal Industrial Association suggested that the Central Bank's discount committee allow the banks that undertake industrial loans to charge a handling fee in addition to the prescribed interest rate in order to compensate for the loss of interest, so as to encourage commercial banks to be willing to handle the loans and enable industrial loans to be universal.</p>

<h3>Yongbei Underwear Factory Electrocution Incident: Guangnan Water and Electricity Firm Manager and Others Indicted for Negligence; Broad Implications Postponed for Further Hearing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] On the night of the typhoon on August 8th of last year, the Yongbei Underwear Factory in Taizhou was struck by lightning, burning 54 workers to death. Following a report by the General Labor Union, the District Prosecutor's Office investigated and found that the Guangnan Water and Electricity Engineering Firm, which contracted the factory's electrical equipment, had failed to fulfill its duties, leading to the disaster. As a result, Guangnan's manager, Guo Zhicheng, and Guangnan's technician, Zhang Qifu, who was responsible for the installation, were indicted on charges of endangering public order. Judge Wu Xiangzu of the District Court held a preliminary hearing yesterday morning. The defendant Guo Zhicheng did not appear, but Zhang Qifu argued that the electrical engineering installed by Guangnan for the Yongbei factory had been approved by both the Public Utilities Bureau and the Works Bureau. He claimed that the installation of a lightning rod had not been requested by Yongbei at the time, so it was not installed, and he could not be held responsible after the fact. The plaintiff was represented by Shui Xiangyun, the former chairman of the Municipal General Labor Union, who provided three points: (1) The Yongbei factory was originally an old-fashioned pawnshop that had been slightly renovated and repainted, and the three stories had been converted into five stories, which was extremely unsafe. (2) The water and electricity engineering was approved by the Public Utilities Bureau, and they should also bear joint responsibility. He demanded a thorough investigation to ensure the safety of workers' lives. The court stated that the case was broad and would be postponed to July 7th for further hearing after investigating with relevant parties.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on the Transfer of Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates Greatly Affect Trade; Import and Export Industries Telegraph Ministries and Commissions to Quickly Cancel</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Import and Export Industry Association believes that the low price of foreign exchange transfer certificates is affecting export business. It recently telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Export Management Committee, and the Central Bank, requesting the cancellation of Central Bank Announcement No. 170. The original text is as follows: We note that our country's international trade policy has been repeatedly touted by the government as encouraging exports and expanding imports, and the foreign exchange transfer certificate method is a concrete manifestation of the implementation of the above policies in the past. Since its implementation, it has achieved significant results. Unexpectedly, the Central Bank suddenly issued Announcement No. 170, which strictly restricted the transfer of foreign exchange transfer certificates, and the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates has been declining day by day, and has been in a slump. As a result, exports from all ports in the country are almost completely at a standstill, and the bad state of smuggling and exchange evasion has reappeared today. This method is contrary to the entire national trade policy. The result of suffocating exports is that foreign exchange income decreases, and if foreign exchange income decreases, it is difficult to increase imports. If this continues, it is unimaginable. To remedy this, we should immediately cancel Central Bank Announcement No. 170. This announcement's most obvious consequence is to reduce exports and increase exchange evasion and smuggling. The country suffers serious losses, and it has a major impact on the overseas markets of our export commodities. Taking tung oil as an example, the American Tung Oil Association has repeatedly asked the US government to say that the cost of Chinese tung oil should be around four US cents per pound according to the current price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, while the selling price in the US market is only two cents and one point, which shows that Chinese tung oil is undermining the interests of American tung farmers by dumping at a discount. Therefore, the American side is about to implement anti-dumping regulations and impose an import tax of more than two cents per pound, which is also being brewed. Other items such as bristles have also experienced similar situations. The reason for this is that the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates differs greatly from the actual exchange rate, which leads to exchange evasion and smuggling. Furthermore, the domestic export goods are oppressed by the re-export of goods transferred through Hong Kong. The Hong Kong price is on average 30% lower than the Shanghai export price, which is due to the escape and smuggling. Legitimate export businesses in the country are suffering severe oppression. Moreover, the change in the transfer of foreign exchange transfer certificates has not promoted imports. From a long-term perspective, it is even more unfavorable to imports. Therefore, this restriction on the transfer method is tantamount to killing the chicken to get the eggs, and is a completely unreasonable measure. Therefore, we telegraph you especially to ask you to review and verify, and request you to forward it to the Central Bank, and quickly revoke Announcement No. 170. The export industry really depends on it.</p>
<h3>Vendors Sell for Cash, Rice Prices Slightly Decline, Flour from Northern Suppliers Gradually Gains Popularity</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw a slight decline, as vendors were mostly selling to finalize accounts, resulting in a large number of sellers. The price of rice in the southern port production area was still low, and the sellers were eager to sell. At the start of the market prices were stable, but because rice shops had limited space to store rice, there was more supply than demand and prices declined. In the Northern District market, white japonica rice retreated to 1,680 yuan, a drop of 40 yuan. Thin indica rice fell 50 yuan, while sheep indica rice was stable. Yin yuan was 50 yuan lower. In the Southern District market, white japonica and thin indica each fell 20 to 30 yuan. The arrival of early rice was at its highest, and prices plummeted by 100 yuan. Yesterday, the two markets received a total of 9,985 piculs.</p>
<p>Flour prices rose. Although rice prices fell, the northern suppliers shipped rice north, so prices soared. The initial asking price for Lao Che flour was 700 yuan, and later it rose to 735 yuan at closing, a huge increase of 60 yuan compared to last Saturday. Bingchuan flour closed at 710 yuan, up 55 yuan. Hong Feng, Jiancheng, etc. all offered over 700 yuan, up more than 50 yuan. Bran also rose 40 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: The market was originally scheduled to finalize procedures yesterday, but because some traders had surplus or insufficient funds, there were still a few transactions, causing prices to fall due to excess supply. Yellow soybeans were down by one hundred yuan, corn by fifty yuan, sesame, red sorghum, and tea beans were all stable, and the off-the-street sales of raw peanuts were still good, and prices were also stable.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Traders are still gathering at the market to finalize procedures, but due to funding issues, there are still a few transactions, and prices have fallen sharply. Soybean oil closed at 6,400 yuan, down 900 yuan. Jilong raw oil fell sharply to 6,500 yuan, a dramatic drop of 1,450 yuan, due to the low price in Qingdao and the expectation of shipments. Rapeseed oil was 5,200 yuan, down 700 yuan. Soybean cake was cut by 20-30 yuan, with prices consistently retreating below 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Supply Exceeds Demand</h3>
<p>The yarn market was strong at first but then fatigued. Although credit was loose, direct sales were still not smooth. Only scattered households made slight purchases, but eventually, due to excessive supply, the market showed a lack of momentum to rise. As a result, the average yarn price fell by about 10%. 42-count Blue Phoenix retreated from 81,000 yuan to close at 77,000 yuan, ultimately falling 4,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell 6,500 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at the previous weekend's original price of 69,000 yuan, but no one was interested in buying it midway, and it ended at 61,000 yuan, plummeting 8,000 yuan. 21-count Shuangma spot retreated from 60,000 yuan to as low as 50,000 yuan, and closed at 52,000 yuan in the afternoon, 6,000 yuan lower than the weekend. Factory orders last traded at 45,000 yuan, also less than 50,000 yuan. Arbitrage for one day was 2,500 yuan. 20-count Shuangma fell 4,000 yuan, while Jincheng and Jinji each fell 6,000 yuan. 16-count and 10-count yarn all fell slightly by 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: At the beginning of the morning's trading, those who held the goods were worried about the currency system after the peace, and the asking prices rose sharply. Midway, the sales to other areas were weak, the customers had little intention of buying, and the local demand was also low. The rising momentum eventually ran out of steam, and the market retreated slightly, closing at a lower price than the weekend, but still slightly higher. Dragon Head fine cloth initially asked for 2,500 yuan, but as the yarn market was reported to be falling, sentiment turned weak, and the price declined gradually. At midday, the lowest price was heard to be around 2,400 yuan. Trumpet fine cloth retreated from 2,100 yuan to a low of 2,050 yuan, and closed at 2,070 yuan in the afternoon, ultimately rising 220 yuan. Other items such as Three Peaches and B Dragon Head fine cloth, etc., each rose by 150 yuan to 250 yuan. The initial opening trend of Four Gentlemen's Yuan Biji was very high, asking for 2,250 yuan, but no one was selling. The closing became fatigued at 2,210 yuan, 240 yuan higher than the weekend. Four Gentlemen's Yuan Zhigong rose 290 yuan, ending at 2,450 yuan. The sales of other cloths were sluggish, and the price changed little.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Flat and Tired</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for rayon fluctuated. As the end of the year approached, scattered households sold continuously, while buyers were very indifferent. Sentiment was weak, credit in the market turned loose, and the market was about to close. Delivery was very complicated. Each stall opened high and closed low. As a result, there was not much fluctuation in the morning market, and the trend in the afternoon market was slightly softer. 120-count Tianqiao opened at 80,000 yuan and sold. Credit saw easing and the stall tried to pull the table up, it looked like there was still a firm plate in the market. Later the cotton market dropped and the gold notes dropped too and they were holding inventory as the situation turned anxious. The market conditions retreated. 75,000 yuan was the morning closing. In the afternoon, gold notes continued to decline, everything turned soft, and the sentiment became more weary, and the price was reduced by another 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw silk: Because the Rayon market was failing, sentiment was lacking to stimulate it. The year end was nearing, and foreign firms mostly stopped buying. Transactions on the stall turned lonely, and the market fell from plate. Excellent grade was 85,000 yuan to close in the first half, just a slight lift from last Saturday. In the afternoon the sentiment was very weak, and there were no takers. The market shouted 83,000 yuan, 84,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Because Gold notes and cloth were under pressure, investment money continued to be squeezed. There was a heavy appetite from the market. Beauty Asia was being advertised at 55,000 yuan with a healthy trend and the buyer was active and the asking price would go up a bit to a thousand. But because the end of the year draws near and as gold notes and cotton price went down, and people became hesitant and soft on the market, it was immediately leveling out. On the front half of the market it closed at 53,000 yuan, showing a lift. With some increased demand. On the after noon market sentiment was idle, and money was coming in and selling. However because the money was smaller, and appetite went slow, and the market became weak as Beauty Asia advertised at 51,500 yuan for offers.</p>
<h3>Little Activity in the Woolen Fabric Market</h3>
<p>Due to the environment and seasonal relationship, woolen fabric transactions have declined sharply. Both retail and wholesale business at tea parties are lonely, and selling prices are all affected by the situation and seasons and all moving down, the private plate is even softer than the plate on the floor, and the actual turnover is very small. Yesterday, Zhanghua woolen cloth was reduced by 1,400 yuan, 1830 and 1831 Biji were 950 yuan, 5009 was 750 yuan, Double Cat Biji was 1,000 yuan, Hongxiang woolen cloth was 1,300 yuan, Fanliding was 1,000 yuan, and Zhongfang Hailvsi was 650 yuan.</p>
<h3>Future Coal Pricing to be Adjusted According to the Exchange Rate of the Taiwan Dollar</h3>
<p>According to the Shipping Association, the Association recently received a telegram from the Coal Adjustment Committee stating that the source of coal is not smooth, and currently only Taiwanese coal can be regularly supplied. Therefore, it is ordered that future coal prices be adjusted according to the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar. In addition, the Shipping Association stated that the allocated coal is insufficient for actual use. It recently requested the Coal Adjustment Committee and the Central Bank to store 10,000 tons of coal in Shanghai to supplement the difference for each shipping company. However, it has not yet received a response from the Coal Adjustment Committee and the National Bank.</p>
<h3>Very Little Business in Tung Oil</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for tung oil, the official price for standard white oil and genuine Xihong, and guild brands all remained at 4,000 yuan without change. Other brands such as deputy brand Xihong and Qing oil, traders asking price has been rather quiet. Market transactions indicate very little business and trading due to year end. Both buyers and sellers adhered to traditional customs and were busy settling accounts for the year and made any business.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Quiet</h3>
<p>As the end of the agricultural year approaches, most industries in this city are settling accounts according to custom. Therefore, tea merchants have been uninterested in making transactions for days, and the process has become even quieter. However, sentiment is unusually stable, so the market can be described as firm. According to people in the industry, the current stock of tea is very low, and sellers are reluctant to part with it.</p>

<h3>Police New Village Fundraising Basketball Game:  Hua Lian Triumphs Over Shanghai Police, Fat Team Fights Valiantly but Loses to Police Mobile Unit by Three Points, Charity Auction of Balls Raises 70,000 Gold Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Police Department held a charity basketball game last night at the Municipal Gymnasium to raise construction funds for the Police New Village.  Commissioner Yu Shuping, along with other police officials, attended the event, which began at 6:00 PM and was watched by nearly a thousand spectators, creating a lively atmosphere. Commissioner Yu also presented each of the four participating teams with a banner to commemorate the occasion. The police band provided musical accompaniment, adding to the spirited and exciting atmosphere.</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM, a charity ball auction was held. Mr. Ding initially bid 50,000, but did not accept the ball. Mr. Dong then purchased it for 20,000, demonstrating admirable generosity. In the first game, the Fat Team fought valiantly but was defeated by the Police Mobile Unit by a score of 32-35, losing by only one and a half baskets. In the main event, Hua Lian maintained its reputation by defeating the mighty Shanghai Police team, which was a guise of Chen You. The encounter between the two teams fulfilled a long-held wish and attracted the attention of many fans. Ultimately, Hua Lian's entire team exerted their efforts and delivered an excellent performance, winning 49-37, with a score of 27-17 in the first half. Detailed match information is as follows:</p>
<p>First Game: Fat Team vs. Police Mobile Unit. The latter scored first, and the Fat Team became anxious, immediately scoring a free throw. The Police Mobile Unit was resourceful, experienced and skilled. They led 5-1. At 10-6, the Fat Team called another time-out, and the game resumed, becoming increasingly intense. In the first half, "Fatty" protested, and the Police Mobile Unit led 18-12. In the second half, the Fat Team's momentum shifted, and they scored points with long-range shots, once narrowing the gap to just one basket (18-16). Unfortunately, the good times did not last, and they gradually fell behind again. However, the Fat Team had many tricks up their sleeves, constantly adjusting their lineup to catch their breath. Sun Mingxin was the team's "Number One," weighing over 200 pounds. His basketball skills were also not bad, shooting accurately from the right corner. The sound of the ball bouncing indicated the Fat Team's fierce offense. The buzzer sounded, and the Police Mobile Unit won 35-32, the Fat Team losing by only three points.</p>

<p>Hua Lian Defeats Shanghai Police</p>
<p>In the main event, Hua Lian faced the Shanghai Police. Liu Fushan, Bao Songyuan, Chuan Jinsheng, Wu Chengzhang, and Li Zhenzhong were Hua Lian's five tigers. The Shanghai Police's five players were Chuan Qixia, He Zeng, Wang Bowen, Shi Jiuquan, and Wang Rongsheng. Shanghai Police's Wang Rongsheng made a free throw first, and Hua Lian's Ah Di Da Li scored five consecutive points. Shanghai Police's Wang Bowen scored two baskets, tying the score at 5-5. Chengzhang scored one point, taking the lead. Wang Rongsheng and Lao Bao both made free throws, tying the score again at 7-7. Songyuan scored twice under the basket, putting Hua Lian ahead 11-7, leading by four points. Fushan also went from static to dynamic, making it 15-9. Shanghai Police alternated He and Jin Gui with Zeng. At this point, Hua Lian had a good passing performance, making it 17-9. Zhang Liangxiong replaced Fu Jinsheng, and on the other side, Liang Yongbiao replaced Shi Jiuquan. Hua Lian's "Wu Bao" duo revealed their prowess, and the opponent's formation was disorganized. At 24-15, Shanghai Police's Sun Moses replaced Wang Bowen, and Hua Lian's Xiao Le replaced Fushan. The two teams engaged in three minutes of "blind flight," a chaotic back-and-forth battle. Hua Lian's momentum was strong, making the score 27-17 at halftime. Scorers: Hua Lian Wu 11 points, Bao 10, and Da Li and Fushan 2 points each.</p>
<p>After the break, Shanghai Police's Wang Rongsheng replaced Chuan Qixia, and Wang Bowen replaced He Zeng. Hua Lian's Han Ting brought out Liangxiong, probably not to play for the time being. Hua Lian showed a one-sided posture, and the Shanghai Police scored only one basket while they increased their score by eleven points. At 38-19, the red-clad team could not exert its power, and at 40-23, Jinsheng returned to the battlefield, and Jia Zhou left. Shanghai Police increased their score by seven points in an instant, as if there was still hope, but time was running out. At 44-34, Han Ting graduated, and Jinsheng entered. In the end, Hua Lian won 49-37.</p>

<h3>Basketball League Authorities Refuse Spectators Without Tickets</h3>
<p>The fourth Basketball League for Group A First Division, Group A Second Division, and the Women's Division opened on the 22nd of this month. Over two thousand spectators attended, with enthusiastic spirits. However, only over four hundred tickets were sold for the lower level, indicating a large number of attendees without tickets. Fearing that league revenues would not be balanced in the future, the organizers issued the following statement:</p>
<p>"This time, we bravely took on this difficult task, and all the construction is mostly for the sake of the competing players. The required funds cannot be raised, so we plan to use the revenue from ticket sales for the games to make up for this. What is taken from sports will be used for sports. From now on, we will have to politely refuse entry to those without tickets. Players should enter the game or watch with their player cards. We also hope that they will not accompany friends without tickets into the venue to avoid disputes with ticket inspectors. We hope that everyone will understand these unavoidable measures."</p>

<p>[United Press, Melbourne, Australia, 23rd] American sprint star McKinley, on tour in Australia, created a new 220-yard world record on a curved track today, clocking in at exactly 20 seconds.

<p>[United Press, Melbourne, Australia, 23rd] The Queen of the last World Games, the Dutchwoman Fanny Blankers-Koen, won three championships at the athletic meet here today. Her 100-yard time was 11.4 seconds, her 80-meter hurdles time was 11.7 seconds, and her high jump was 4 feet 11 inches.</p>
<h3>Act Three of the Basketball League: Shanghai Police Face N.K.A.S. Today; Two Group A Second Division Matches First, Starting at 5:30 PM</h3>
<p>The fourth Basketball League continues today, starting at 5:30 PM, with three acts at the Municipal Gymnasium. Tickets are 25 yuan for the upper level, 50 yuan for the lower level, and 80 yuan for reserved seating inside the venue. There are no women's matches today. All three matches are in the Group A division. The order and referees are as follows:</p>
<p>Hua Nan vs. He Zhong (A2 B) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Tie Lian vs. American Weather (A2 C) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Shanghai Police vs. N.K.A.S. (A1 Group) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>In the first match of Group A2 B, Hua Nan faces He Zhong. Hua Nan has a considerable history in Shanghai. This time, they are making a comeback, no different from Chun Mao, with veterans such as Liu Fuqiang, Li Xianzheng, and Deng Guozhang, and the addition of new forces Huang Tianlie and He Hanfu, making them even stronger. He Zhong is also a strong team in this group, with a lineup primarily from Zhongyi. They are sure to have a fierce battle with Hua Nan. Next is Group A2 C, Tie Lian vs. American Weather. The latter played against Donghua in a friendly match. Although they won first and then lost, their performance was not weak. They must be cautious when facing Tie Lian, otherwise, they may suffer a sneak attack.</p>
<h3>Football Committee Resolution: Spring Festival Charity Football Game: Hua Lian vs. Western Union Again, Held on the Third Day of the New Year at Yiyuan</h3>
<p>The Football Committee held a meeting the day before yesterday (22nd) to discuss matters such as the association's charity matches this season. The resolutions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) It was decided that the association's charity match this season will be held on January 31st (the third day of the Lunar New Year), inviting the Hua Lian and Western Union teams from the Winter Relief Match to compete again, with ticket revenue to be distributed to charitable organizations in the city. (2) It was decided that for the charity match on January 31st, ticket prices will be 50 yuan for general seating and 100 yuan for special seating.</p>
<p>Spring Festival Football Schedule Announced</p>
<p>This Saturday is Lunar New Year's Day. The Football Committee has arranged and announced the schedule for football matches during this Spring Festival. On Saturday (29th), New Year's Day, in the league, Jingwu will meet Qingbai in Group A at Yiyuan. On the weekend (30th), the Group A match will be Railway against Longtou, in addition to two Group C matches. Among them, the Public Communication vs. Longtou B match is the Group C3 divisional final. On Monday (31st), the third day of the New Year, the association's charity football match this season will still be contested by the Hua Lian and Western Union teams. The full schedule is listed below:</p>
<p>January 29th (Saturday)</p>

<p>Hua Lian vs. Western Union (Charity Match) 2:30 PM, Yiyuan</p>
<p>The last act is Group A, N.K.A.S. vs. Shanghai Police. The foreign team has always been powerful among the Western teams in the city and has often been a major concern for our Chinese teams. This year, in addition to the Kairoski brothers, Clebert Otto Chai Liao, and others, the giant main players Kaiji Miilov, Funik, and others are all mobilized, showing a great ambition to win the championship. The Shanghai Police is a guise of Chen You. They gathered for training in the Chen You Cup last season, so they were able to keep pace with Huili, and their hopes for the championship are high. Their strength and cooperation are well-known. He Zeng, Wang Bowen, Wang Rongsheng, Chuan Qixia, and others all possess superb skills. Facing the foreign team for the first time, they should be able to display everything. However, having fought Hua Lian in the charity game the night before, they may feel slightly fatigued, which is a concern.</p>

<h3>Huainan Under the Sound of Peace Talks</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou Seventeenth Telegram] Since Zhu Ziwen was ordered to preside over Guangdong in the autumn of the year before last, informed people have seen that this vast Huainan area will become an important base for the government's politics, military affairs, and economy. Now, this question has an even clearer answer. Indeed, amidst the flames of war, the ferocity of the conflict has approached the Yangtze River basin, and only this remote southern region can still be said to have "stability." However, the burden of the great rear area on its shoulders will increase with the evolution of the situation.</p>
<p>The Influx of Refugees Heading South</p>
<p>Arrived like a tidal wave a month ago, adding a lot of excitement to this quiet southern region. Although no one has ever counted how much the population has increased, now, in any corner, especially in more upscale public places, one can hear the accents of Mandarin spoken by those "out-of-province" friends, making people almost think that the government's promotion of the national language movement has achieved such widespread success, and feel amazed. These people who came south naturally felt fortunate when they first stepped into the gates of Guangzhou. But when they settled down, they immediately felt the threat of the high cost of living, because Guangzhou is probably the city with the highest prices in the country now. Even if they brought "IOUs," one note could only be exchanged for a few Hong Kong dollars, and almost all daily expenses here require Hong Kong dollars, which inevitably makes them imagine: they can escape death, but they cannot escape the terror of hunger. Therefore, many people came with excitement, but many returned in disappointment.</p>
<p>However, until now, this surge of people has continued to increase. Staff and families of various central government agencies have become a large column, collectively arriving in a mighty manner by sea, land, and air. Naturally, these poor civil servants will immediately taste what it is like to live under the "salty dragon" (Cantonese term for Hong Kong dollars). Moreover, as the population increases, the market price of Hong Kong dollars will inevitably increase due to high demand, and the price of everything based on Hong Kong dollars will be even more unpredictable. Here, some people may ask: Guangzhou is a Chinese territory, why is it allowing Hong Kong dollars to circulate so freely, and why doesn't the government stop it? This question is indeed perplexing, but the fact is just that. This is probably because the law only prohibits the trading of foreign currency, but does not prohibit people from holding it, so transactions in the market, although</p>
<p>Everything is settled in Hong Kong dollars</p>
<p>It can be said that it is "transfer of ownership" rather than a trading behavior, which leaves the authorities helpless. Moreover, the authorities seem to advocate letting general market trade develop freely, rather than excessively strict control. In Guangzhou now, there is indeed no shortage of resources, whether they are daily necessities or non-essential goods. However, the continuous rise in prices is also frightening enough. This is naturally an unavoidable fact in the situation of weak production and insufficient supply. But the political and economic policy here is not afraid of it rising, only afraid of not having it, so it can maintain a relatively stable facade in Guangdong when the markets in Beijing and Shanghai are most chaotic, which is the reason.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Song took charge of Guangdong for more than a year, the most obvious political achievement that people recognize is that he is most capable in dealing with food, which is also a result of his efforts in material regulation. However, there are also two things that he considers most troublesome, namely smuggling and public security. Regarding the former, it can be said that it is not very serious at present. In recent months, in addition to some smuggling of grain and tungsten ore exports, the smuggling of imported goods has indeed decreased significantly. This is certainly related to the strengthening of inspections by both parties after the Sino-Hong Kong anti-smuggling agreement, but the main reason is probably the generally weak purchasing power of domestic cities. Although there are many routes for foreign goods to come, the domestic sales are sluggish, and the price of goods naturally falls, making smugglers feel it is not worthwhile, and they would rather not do it on their own. Therefore, this problem is temporarily considered to have come to an end, but the latter problem has become increasingly serious. Since Mr. Song</p>
<p>Began to take charge of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters</p>
<p>He has been striving to strengthen the issue of public security. Mr. Song subsequently employed a group of veteran generals known for their good faces during the Anti-Japanese War to establish ten suppression zones and two border zone command headquarters. Together with the navy stationed in Guangdong by the Central Government and a newly trained national army, the military strength has at least tripled compared to before. However, the results of suppression in various zones were not as ideal as he had hoped. According to the recent report of the Security Department to the Senate: the total number of bandits in the province is 32,000. Even if this number is true, it proves that bandits have not decreased due to suppression, but have only increased compared to the 29,000 reported by the previous Senate. Moreover, in last winter, several units that had originally surrendered and been incorporated defected: such as the entire battalion of Wang Guoquan's 11th Security Battalion in Dongjiang; two companies of the 6th Security Regiment on Hainan Island; and the most rampant, two battalions of Chen Yilin's 10th Security Regiment on the South Road. This time, they also tricked and killed Mr. Song's "favorite general," Zhang Junhao, commander of the 10th Suppression Zone (formerly the head of the Tax Police Regiment, and commander of the Provisional 8th Division during the war), and deputy commander Deng Bohan. This was indeed a great blow to Mr. Song.</p>
<p>Mr. Song's understanding of this problem is that the treatment of security teams is too poor, less than half that of the national army. Therefore, he decided to increase their treatment as much as possible without increasing the burden on the people; recently, he has also changed to issuing in-kind benefits. At present, the treatment of security teams in Guangdong Province is actually better than that of the national army. At the same time, Mr. Song further realized that using soldiers to defend the people is not as effective as the people defending themselves. Therefore, he organized a fairly large people's self-defense force.</p>
<p>The Provincial People's Self-Defense Force</p>
<p>Already has a total of 500 companies, and the reserve self-defense force has more than 3,000 companies. According to statistics: Guangdong has at least 300,000 civilian guns. If they can be used well, it will of course be a considerable force. Therefore, he shouted out the slogan "Determine to Defend Guangdong"; gathered people from all walks of life, and established a local self-defense guidance committee. Deputy Commander Huang Guoliang, a lieutenant general of the Guangdong Security Forces who had years of experience in combat in Jiangbei Shandong, drafted a "New Plan for Suppressing Bandits in Guangdong Province." The main point is to use the self-defense forces of the people to launch a guerrilla plan. Mr. Song repeatedly expressed his willingness to humbly accept opinions from all parties at the meeting. This point is credible. Mr. Song, who is considered an expert in finance and economics, probably also learned some lessons during the suppression year and more; knowing that using soldiers is not as easy as he imagined. Therefore, he has strongly urged veterans like Xue Yue and Zhang Fakui to come out of retirement, and he is willing to cede military power to more capable people.</p>
<p>Some time ago, there were rumors that the five provinces of Huainan (Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian) would establish a joint defense organization, or that a general headquarters for suppressing bandits in the five provinces would be established. The source of this rumor may be due to the fact that the chairmen of Guangxi and Fujian provinces, and representatives of the chairmen of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guizhou provinces visited Mr. Song in Guangzhou one after another last winter. I dare not say that they completely had no such intention, but even if there is a plan for the connection of the five provinces, I believe it is more in the economic aspect, and very little in the military and political aspects. Because the leaders of various provinces in Huainan may have considerable potential in their local areas. Under the current situation, it is not easy to find a general who can have</p>
<p>The prestige to command the five provinces</p>
<p>and power. If it is an economic cooperation organization, such as the exchange of materials, transportation, and stabilization of finance among the five provinces, then of course there is an absolute possibility. Because what Mr. Song can truly show his achievements in Huainan is probably still in economic construction. Indeed, since Mr. Song took office,</p>
<p>Significant Progress in Economic Construction</p>
<p>has been his characteristic. Such as building Huangpu Port; planning the Wengjiang Hydropower Project; planning the construction of a coal-fired Dogtooth Cave branch line; increasing the construction of sugar factories and restoring the Guangzhou Paper Factory; actively developing transportation, and building water conservancy projects, etc., not only is he working hard, but some of them have already had concrete results. Take the Huangpu Port project as an example. Since the completion of the highway connecting Huangpu and Guangzhou, as well as the docks and warehouses, it has assumed a great responsibility in this evacuation. There have been hundreds of large and small ships berthed at Huangpu Wharf; all people or goods can be conveniently transported to Guangzhou by road. The second phase of construction of Huangpu is still actively being carried out. As for the Dogtooth Cave branch line, 25,000 workers are currently mobilized every day, spending 2 billion yuan, and it will be completed by the end of this month. After its completion, the mining area is estimated to have 7,200 tons of coal, which can be supplied continuously. According to the daily coal demand of Guangdong as 500 tons, it can supply for 50 to 100 years. Even after the supply of northern coal is cut off, the coal in Huainan provinces is sufficient and more than enough to supply. As for the remaining construction projects, they are also being actively promoted. Therefore, if the public security problem in Guangdong can be solved, it will shorten some milestones on the bright road of economic construction.</p>
<h3>Household Administration Work in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province: The Department of Civil Affairs Suggests Eight Key Points</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Twenty-second Telegram] The Department of Civil Affairs of Jiangsu Province regards household administration as the mother of all governance, and it is especially important now than usual. Recently, it specifically suggested eight key points for future work. Director Gu Xiping sent separate letters to the county magistrates to strictly comply with them: (1) Household administration personnel at all levels in the county should be established in full accordance with regulations, and should not be transferred to handle other businesses. (2) Those whose household administration equipment is not yet complete should follow the department's repeated telegrams, fully budget funds, spend all at once, seize the time, and expedite production to avoid the impact of price fluctuations. (3) Those household administration cadres at all levels who have been trained but have poor skills should be retrained, and those who have not been trained should be actively trained. Professional lectures can be adopted, and the time should not be less than two weeks, with special emphasis on practice. All training should be completed by the end of February. (4) Aquatic Baojia must be strictly managed. (5) Joint Bao Lian Zuo must be strengthened and implemented. (6) The age conversion of the household registration book must be completed uniformly before the end of March. (7) Household administration personnel at all levels in the county should conduct work reviews and learn from each other. The county government should convene household registration cadres from various townships and towns every month to hold a work review meeting once. Household registration cadres from various townships and towns should regularly convene Bao household registration clerks to hold review meetings, openly discuss the gains and losses of work, and pool wisdom to seek improvements. (8) The work of transcribing household registration books can make full use of woodcuts to save manpower and make them neat.</p>
<h3>The Salt Problem in Guizhou Province is Serious</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guiyang Twelfth Airmail] Chairman Gu Zhenglun took a special train to Chongqing and flew to Beijing early in the morning of New Year's Eve last year after receiving a telegram from the President. He flew back to Guiyang after more than ten days. Our reporter went to visit him on the second day after his return to Guiyang. Due to various reasons, he talked very little about the current situation, but he talked in detail about the beginning and end of the salt problem that 11 million Guizhou people have been anxious about day and night and has been noisy for a month, and believes that this salt problem, which is indispensable to the lives of the people of Guizhou, if the relevant authorities in the central government cannot find a way to provide relief as soon as possible, the impact of the salt shortage in the future, whether the overall situation is peace or war, and the public security order in the rear, will be difficult to predict. He said: Although the central government has agreed to find a way to provide relief, the salt problem is often said to be related to national finances, and coupled with the low administrative efficiency of our country, the thorough solution of this problem cannot but rely on the power of the people. According to Gu, Guizhou salt</p>
<p>Has relied on Sichuan salt supply. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau has increased prices at any time, and the people of Guizhou have long expressed their dissatisfaction. Especially from the introduction of the Gold Yuan to December 1 last year, the time was only three months, but the salt price has been adjusted six times, as high as more than 53 times. Before the war, the people were happy to talk about rice and salt per catty. At present, the highest price of rice per dou is only 20 yuan, while the black market price of salt per catty has reached 25 yuan, which means that a dou of rice cannot buy a catty of salt. This refers to Guiyang City. In remote counties and villages, salt has long been regarded as a "treat." Unless there are weddings, funerals, celebrations, or festivals, they dare not even think about it. Salt is one of the "seven things to open the door every day" in people's lives. Such a strange rise in price, exceeding the people's ability to bear it, is unthinkable in the future!</p>
<p>Since the Sichuan-Kang Bureau announced the salt account, the dissatisfaction of the people of Guizhou with the Bureau has become even more intense. First of all, Gu Zhenglun himself scolded the Sichuan-Kang Bureau loudly on the phone with Zhu Shaoliang, director of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, for "neither benefiting the country nor harming the people." Then, the county and municipal governments and the people of Guizhou Province unanimously advocated</p>
<p>Thoroughly liquidate the Salt Bureau, making a great deal of noise. During this period, although there was a great deal of noise, the people could still buy salt per catty at black market prices because the Salt Bureau had abundant reserves. By the end of December, the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau suddenly received a telegram ordering the Guizhou Salt Bureau to "temporarily postpone the sale of official and commercial salt per catty that has been taxed and shipped out of the warehouse." As a result, more than 300,000 people in Guiyang City, from December 29 to January 4, did not have an ounce of salt supply in the city for a week. The black market salt per catty originally cost only 11 or 12 yuan. During this week, it rose day by day, reaching as high as 24 or 25 yuan per catty, and it still required "connections" to buy it. Although the Provincial Senate and the Provincial Government repeatedly called for urgent telegrams to release sales as soon as possible, the Salt Bureau levied salt tax at the central government level and changed to ad valorem collection. The collection standard was also approved by the second session of the Legislative Yuan, and 10% was levied on those who sold in Guizhou. Its cost per dan was 137 yuan and 66 cents, and the assessment was 14 yuan per zu, and it was implemented from January 1 this year. However, since December 1 last year, the assessed price per dan of well salt in Guiyang has been 578 yuan and 78 cents. How unreasonable is this, exceeding the 137 yuan and 66 cents approved by the Legislative Yuan. The Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau saw that the Guizhou salt problem could not be solved, which was not their blessing, and Guizhou Province was determined to open up Guangdong, Yunnan, Huai and other places to salt. Sichuan salt will soon run into obstacles in Guizhou. If they do not reduce prices as soon as possible, they will also be making a cocoon and imprisoning themselves. Therefore, after the sales were released on January 4, it was decided again that "all salt catties that were allocated but not received before December 1 will be allowed to be distributed according to the previous pricing method after adding 8 yuan and 40 cents of salt tax per dan, and the amount will be paid." The so-called salt price allocated before December 1 was 233 yuan and 77 cents per dan, and the salt tax was 5 yuan and 60 cents per dan. However, the Salt Bureau has a restriction that it must be "allocated but not received," and only those who have prepaid part of the price are valid.</p>
<p>What is the current price of Guizhou salt stipulated by the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau</p>
<p>By claiming that the salt tax has been reformed? It stipulates that each dan is 716 yuan, 1 jiao and 4 fen, which is nearly 200 yuan more than the 578 yuan, 7 jiao and 8 fen, which the people of Guizhou have been opposing for a month since the assessed price of December 1. The result of the opposition is like this. How can the people of Guizhou live without finding a way to open up Guangdong, Yunnan and Huai salt? Gu Zhilun has been promoting the planting of American tobacco, rapeseed, and tung oil in Guizhou as much as possible, hoping to exchange them for Guangdong salt with Guangdong, and trying to mobilize the legislative and supervisory committee members and national representatives outside the province and the important officials of Guizhou origin who work in the central government to cooperate with him to jointly appeal to the central government to strictly order the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau to reduce the salt price. He believes that as long as the people of Guizhou can have salt to eat, and even not eat expensive salt, that is the only great good deed he can do as the chairman of Guizhou Province to comfort the people of Guizhou. According to Gu's words to the reporter: The Guizhou salt problem</p>
<p>Is so bad, because: (1) Government and merchants collude to cheat and raise prices. Salt merchants must respond to any request to increase prices. Except for a part of the salt sold by the Salt Bureau itself, the salt transportation and sales in Guizhou are entrusted to merchants. If the salt transporters believe that the cost is insufficient, they can request the Salt Bureau to increase the freight to compensate, otherwise they will threaten to stop transportation, while creating rumors and black markets to obtain double profits from increasing freight and selling salt on the black market. There are more than a dozen existing entrusted salt transporters in Guizhou, including [Zhonghe], [Daye], and [Limin]. On the surface, they are just transporters, but in the dark, they have countless salespersons as followers, and they also collude with the Salt Bureau. Moreover, they themselves are Hao's capital, using the means of semi-official and semi-commercial buying and selling to harm the people of Guizhou. If salt officials, financiers, and transporters communicate to form a series, the salt problem in Guizhou Province will never be solved. (2) The Salt Bureau is poorly managed, the measures are inappropriate, and the transportation and sales methods are outdated and do not conform to reality. Guizhou Province needs 110,000 dans of salt per month. At the current salt price, each zu is 716 yuan, 1 jiao and 4 fen, and the monthly cost is more than 78 million yuan. The annual total is nearly 800 million yuan in gold yuan. Such a huge number, private capital, Miao is difficult to take on. Transportation in Guizhou Province is inconvenient. It takes more than four months to transport it from Zigong or Yule production sites in Sichuan to the wholesale location in Guizhou. The capital of the long-term transportation is huge, and ordinary merchants cannot do it.</p>
<p>Gu Zhenglun and enlightened people in Guizhou believe that to solve the salt problem, it is necessary to</p>
<p>Implement the following methods to make the 11 million people of Guizhou have no suffering from expensive salt and light salt: (1) Please ask the central government to clearly designate this province as a special sales area, and all salt transportation and sales will be handled by the state. (2) Before the state unifies the handling, the salt tax should be collected at the production site, the government will handle the transportation from the site to the shore, and the people will be allowed to freely transport and sell from the shore to the province, and break the sales area system to allow the people to freely purchase and eat Yunnan and Huai salt without restrictions. (3) Please provide low-interest loans from the National Bank for the purchase and transportation of salt. (4) Adopt the "Ding Baozhen Gongbao Salt Law," which has been effective for decades, to implement official transportation and commercial sales, increase salt storage bases, and adopt strict management methods. (5) The provincial government may request the appointment of a deputy head to participate in the central salt affairs agencies set up in this province to adjust surpluses and deficiencies and manage all the businesses of official transportation and commercial sales. (6) Telegram the central government to strictly order the Salt Bureau to store the full amount of Changping salt in this province, and only sell it when there is a salt shortage. It cannot be sold together with commercial salt at ordinary times. (7) Please ask the central government to thoroughly investigate and punish the salt affairs officials and merchants who collude and commit fraud, and announce the numbers of salt cats that have been allocated but not sold before December 1948. (8) Please ask the central government to take into account that Guizhou Province does not produce salt and specially approve the reduction of salt prices.</p>
<h3>A Murder Case in Wuxi City: The Tragic Death of the Manager's Wife</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi Twenty-second Telegram] Jiang Jingzhai, the manager of the Wuxi branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, currently lives at No. 4 Shawenjing, Guangfu Gate. At more than 10:00 p.m. on the 20th of this month, Jiang and his wife, Wang Suyue, were lying in bed when suddenly a strange thug broke in, claiming to be surnamed Wang, a native of Jiangyin. When he explained his intention, an old servant happened to go out to get tea. The thug, fearing that he would go out to report to the police, immediately took out a pistol from his sleeve and shot at Jiang. Because he avoided it properly, he was not hit. Jiang's wife, Wang, tried to persuade him, but the thug fired two shots at her. The second bullet entered from the temple, and she died before reaching the hospital. Seeing that he had caused trouble, the thug hurriedly went downstairs and fled. At that time, the Queen's Theater was just dismissing the audience, and the thug mixed into the crowd and escaped. After the incident, the city defense command immediately issued an emergency alert, announced special martial law, and sent investigation team members to rush to the scene of the incident to conduct a detailed investigation. Finally, the major suspect in the case, Shi Yubao, was captured the next morning.</p>
<p>The Victim: A Page of Vicissitudes</p>
<p>Since the case occurred, because it is located in the city and is very close to the Guangfu Gate Guard, and such a bizarre murder case occurred during martial law, it has spread throughout the city. According to general speculation, the content of this case is complex and there must be other circumstances. The victim, Wang Suyue, is 28 years old, originally surnamed Pan, from outside the West Gate of Liyang. Her family was as poor as the law. When she was three years old, her mother sent her to the prostitute Wang outside Guangfu Gate as an adopted daughter, named Xiao Jindi (an elder sister named Da Jindi was also an adopted daughter). When she was nine years old, she suffered from typhoid fever and external symptoms. Although her left foot was bad, fortunately it did not hinder her walking style. In the spring of 1943, Xiao Jindi met Jiang Jingzhai (over 50 years old), an employee of the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank. The two fell in love at first sight and soon lived together. Jindi's name was changed to "Wang Suyue." After the victory, Jiang managed to become the manager of the Xif Branch of the Provincial Farmers Bank and had smooth sailing.</p>
<p>Married the Manager: Became Famous for Speculation</p>
<p>After Jiang and Wang lived together, Wang was unusually clever and gained Jiang's favor. Jiang had a total of three wives and concubines, the eldest was in Shanghai, the second was in Suzhou, and Suyue ranked third, living in Wuxi. She accompanied her husband to work in the bank every day, serving him on the left and right. When prices fluctuated, she also took the opportunity to do business. Because she was capable and had good skills, no matter what the market was, rice, flour, gauze, gold, etc., no one did not know about "Mrs. Jiang" when they talked about it. Jiang's family was also managed by Suyue. Even speaking of the bedroom of the Jiang family, the whole set of pink furniture was of unparalleled elegance, which shows one aspect of the happiness of the Jiang family.</p>
<p>Poor Brother-in-Law: Borrowing Money Caused Trouble</p>
<p>Jiang has a relative, Shi Yubao, who is from Shijia, Qianzhou, and currently lives at No. 10 Xiaocai Market, Zhoushanbang. He once worked as an agent, so he has a White Langlin pistol. Now he has a rice and grain stall there, and business is normal. His wife, Yue, is "Da Jindi," and Wang is a righteous sister. The two have a good relationship after marrying and often visit each other. However, because the husbands they married are very different in wealth, one is a bank manager and the other is a local rascal, Shi often borrowed money from Jiang. Half a month ago, he borrowed one stone of rice and 1,000 yuan in gold yuan. Shi wrote a threatening letter to Jiang because it was not enough for expenses, saying: I have helped you a lot and helped your wife earn a lot of money. You should borrow some money, otherwise I will personally settle the account at your home. The words were very threatening. Jiang ignored it at that time. After the bloody case occurred, the investigation team believed that Shi was a major suspect, so they sent people to arrest him. It is not difficult to obtain the real culprit based on this clue.</p>
<h3>A Recent Incident in Chengdu: Sharp Conflict Between the Municipal Government and the City Council</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chengdu Dispatch, 21st] As the lunar New Year approaches, the festive atmosphere in the inland city of Chengdu is much stronger than that of the Gregorian New Year. In recent days, families have been replacing peach wood charms to welcome the new year with firecrackers, and the wave of peace adds a touch of "prosperity." Although the war is far away, the general public's concern for peace is no less than that of compatriots closer to the war zone. After ten years of turmoil, the people are weary. Moreover, the price surge, which came with the old year, weighs heavily on people's lives, and their desire for governance is redoubled.</p>
<p>In this atmosphere of peace, unfortunately, discord between the Chengdu Municipal Government and the City Council has sparked a contentious dispute fraught with animosity. Originally, Chengdu Mayor Qiao Cheng belonged to the "nouveau riche" in the Sichuan officialdom, while the City Council had many social "celebrities" and "dignitaries." In the eyes of the councilors, Mayor Qiao was a young upstart who had climbed to a high position through connections, and there was a deep-seated reason to look down on him. In addition, Qiao's measures in recent years have been quite inappropriate, and he has been at a loss in municipal affairs. In particular, the inability to solve the city's finances has caused the most criticism regarding employee benefits and municipal construction. The cause of the conflict has been long-standing. At the last City Council general meeting, concerning the issue of Mayor Qiao concurrently serving as the director of the donation office involving "corruption," the council unanimously passed a resolution to report six major charges against Qiao to the provincial government: (1) extravagant decrees, (2) illegal collection of fees for national identity cards, (3) illegal collection of money for illicit gain, (4) stealing and selling public grain, (5) illegal collection of children's welfare funds, and (6) misguided measures. In addition to sending letters to the provincial government, the Sichuan-Kang Supervision Committee, and the administrative office to report the matter, the speaker and deputy speaker personally met with Chairman Wang Lingji to request his removal and investigation. However, several months have passed, and the provincial government has not investigated, and Mayor Qiao has continued to do things his own way, determined to deal with the situation with the Huang-Lao philosophy of "letting them laugh and scold as they please, I will be a good official myself." This has further aroused the extreme dissatisfaction of all councilors. The council convened its twelfth general meeting a few days ago, and in addition to holding an opening ceremony and issuing a telegram supporting peace, it formally announced its adjournment to show that it would never coexist with the mayor and would not reconvene until the goal of replacing Qiao was achieved. The next day, senior officials of the municipal government collectively resigned to protest the council's actions. The evolving situation is seen by Mayor Qiao as "personal spite," by the council as a matter of "parliamentary dignity," by the provincial government as "illegitimate," and by the common people as "a farce." Today, the stalemate has become even more acute. Some believe that the conflict between the government and the council may cause waves in the Sichuan political scene. How it will develop remains to be seen in the next installment.</p>
<p>Follow-up Report on the Case of Yu Chao, Assistant Manager of the Tunxi Branch of the Former Central Bank of China</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Tunxi Dispatch, 18th] Wang Gongchen, prosecutor of the Xiuning District Court, recently released the indictment of Yu Chao, the former assistant manager of the Tunxi Branch of the Bank of China, for embezzlement. The original text is nearly ten thousand words, detailing the investigation process of the case and the criminal charges, which have been submitted to the criminal court of the court for trial, along with a request to increase his sentence and impose a severe penalty. As for the accomplices involved in the case, due to the complexity of the content, further investigation is needed, and they will be handled separately.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The reporter recently visited Jiang Tonghou, speaker of the Anhui Provincial Council, who is recuperating in his hometown of Dongyuan (Longfu), three miles from Tunxi, to inquire about his views on the peace issue and the future trends in northern and southern Anhui. He pondered this question for a long time and slowly replied, "Peace is difficult, and war is also difficult, but only peace can restore the people's livelihood, so war is not as good as peace." Jiang is a native of She County in southern Anhui. He was once known as the "Jiangnan Talent" for his literary reputation and profound learning. He had a close relationship with Hu Shih in his early years, and Hu's hometown of Jixi is a neighboring county of She. In addition, people in southern Anhui believe that the war cannot be dragged on any longer, and they will soon jointly express a concrete opinion publicly.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Qu County Dispatch, 24th] Former Quxian County Magistrate Cheng Yunqi's corruption has been substantiated, and the court has been ordered to schedule a public trial.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Demonstration in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Jiang Feng</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinhua Dispatch, 22nd] In the autumn of last year, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization took a liking to Zhejiang and planned to work with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Zhejiang Provincial Government to build Zhejiang into an agricultural demonstration province. Thus, the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Extension Committee was established in response to this need. There are seven members of the committee, and a supervisory office was established under the committee as the implementing agency for the project. After deliberations by many experts, twenty-five counties, including Hang County, were selected as demonstration areas in the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Jinhua areas, with Jinhua as the center. The steps were discussed very thoroughly, and the plan was drawn up very carefully, but later, due to funding problems, the plan was largely "called off." However, since the drums and gongs had already been sounded, it had to be done, so the demonstration area was reduced, leaving only Xiaoshan, Haining, Yuhang, and Hangzhou for implementation. Since the beginning of September, each county has been raising funds and adding technical personnel under the extremely difficult circumstances of the county's finances, scattering them in the fields or rural areas to work on the ground.</p>
<p>In the past four months, the demonstration areas of the above-mentioned three counties and one city have carried out the following tasks:</p>
<p>(1) Rice Preservation. Over the years, the pure-line rice varieties promoted by each county have gradually become mixed and inferior. After the establishment of the demonstration area, efforts were made to encourage counties and cities to strengthen guidance to farmers in carrying out field preservation work, eliminating the false and inferior, totaling 630 mu. After implementation, the purity has been increased to over 95%, and it is planned to be used for special contract breeding of original seeds next year.</p>
<p>(2) Wheat Promotion: The wheat promotion work is carried out in conjunction with the Zhejiang Province Food Production Increase Plan, with a promotion area of 17,450 mu.</p>
<p>(3) Tobacco Improvement: Xiaoshan introduced 50 mu of American tobacco "Foguang" variety and plans to set up a small-scale tobacco curing house for improvement demonstration.</p>
<p>(4) Yellow Ramie Preservation: Haining once promoted 25,000 mu of Indian ramie, but because its seeds are quite mixed, guidance was provided for seed preservation on 20 mu.</p>
<p>(5) Vegetable Disease and Insect Control: Hangzhou City carried out vegetable disease and insect control, introducing the use of sprayers and guiding the application of 237 jin of derris powder, lead arsenate, DDT, and other agents. 213 mu was designated as an insect control demonstration area in the central location, and many villagers imitated and implemented it.</p>
<p>(6) Promoting Improved Sheepfolds: Sheep farming is a common and important sideline for farmers in Haining. The construction of farm sheepfolds has been slightly improved to facilitate ventilation and drainage. An improved demonstration sheepfold has been built on a contract farm in Yuanhua Township to promote it.</p>
<p>(7) Promoting Farmland Water Conservancy: Assisting Xiaoshan in dredging and reclaiming Xiang Lake, and the first phase of dike construction and water pumping is currently underway. Farmers' groups in Haining purchased five water pumps and launched voluntary labor to dredge river ports.</p>
<p>(8) Holding Farmer Training Classes: In order to utilize the agricultural slack season, impart practical skills, and increase farmers' interest in improving agricultural affairs, various agricultural life training classes have been held in each demonstration area since the end of November, lasting for five to seven days, totaling seven locations, with a total of 274 young farmers participating.</p>
<p>The pilot of the agricultural demonstration area is the first of its kind in China. Although much work has been done in just four months, the performance of the results is still not satisfactory.</p>
<p>Based on past experience, the supervisory office of the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Extension Committee has formulated five principles as the basis for future work, after reviewing the gains and losses of the extension work in recent months.</p>
<p>(1) Business design should target the entire life of farmers, promote in multiple directions, and suit the interests and needs of farmers, not just limited to technical improvements.</p>
<p>(2) The implementation area and objects must be concentrated, taking agricultural extension as the center and starting point, and coordinating with water conservancy, land administration, education, health, organization and training, and agricultural loans and other facilities, depending on the local environment, to achieve great results.</p>
<p>(3) Agricultural extension is a kind of educational service work, neither a charitable undertaking nor a routine matter. Administrative power from top to bottom should be used less, and more teaching methods should be used to inspire farmers' awareness of improvement.</p>
<p>(4) Rural construction should be based on farmers as the main body, and the interest and ability of farmers to automate should be cultivated to tap the potential of farmers and achieve the goal of self-reliance.</p>
<p>(5) Agricultural construction is the basis of all governance. After the foundation is stable, it can take root locally after being guided and improved. Special attention should be paid to the cultivation and training of rural leaders and the strengthening of county and township autonomous organizations.</p>
<p>Millions of farmers are waiting for this "flower of agricultural extension demonstration," planted on the fertile soil of Zhejiang, to bear fruit soon.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Wang Denggui, a farmer from Xiawu Township, Gaolan County, Gansu, accepted the will of a friend, which contained a method for inventing a kind of food. This food is similar to lotus root starch. If a person eats ten liang a day, they will not be hungry or thirsty, and it is sweet and palatable, moisturizing the lungs and opening the stomach, making it most suitable for travel. The raw materials are purely made from food, and the cost is extremely low, but the manufacturing method is complicated. Wang Denggui has submitted the manufacturing method and efficacy to Chairman Guo for review, requesting adoption and approval for public disclosure.</p>
