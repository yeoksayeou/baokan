<p>〔本報南京一日電〕京中大專十一單位學生數千人，於今日和平代表團離京赴平開始進行和談聲中，因舉行大規模遊行示威運動，致與軍官發生衝突，引起互毆，雙方受傷者不下一百六十餘人，五人重傷，生命垂危。事態嚴重，首都衛戌總部為防止擴大，業經採取緊急措施，於當晚十時起提早特別戒嚴，並下令自二日起如有任何收容總隊隊員主動前往任何學校，與學生發生任何衝突者，一律就地槍決。行政院長何應欽對於此一不幸事件，除表示無限遺憾外，將予調查，追究責任。據悉學生之欲舉行示威遊行，治安當局事先已接獲報告，故曾設法予以勸告，但未收效。迨至一日晨十時，十一單位大專學生三千人，在中大集合後，先到總統府請願，派代表十人，請謁李代總統，提出數項要求。包括要求全面公費，實行七項諾言，爭取真和平，反對假和平等，由秘長翁文灝代見，表示同情學生之要求，允予轉達，並將設法改善全體員生工友待遇，學生乃離總統府，遊行全市，以卡車數輛為宣傳車，沿途高呼口號「反飢餓，反迫害」，「反對美援」，「反對發行大鈔」，「反對徴兵徴糧」，「反對假和平」，並扮秧歌向民眾宣傳，至下午二時廿分仍返中大解散，各校學生分別結隊返校。當學生遊行時，曾在大中橋附近，因所喊口號過於刺激，並張貼標語，向軍官宣傳，與駐該地附近之軍官總隊（均為徐蚌會戰撤退歸來之軍官）數人發生糾紛，軍官撕去學生所貼標語，及至學生解散後，劇專學生約一百數十人結隊返校，行抵大中橋，與軍官士兵約三百餘人，發生衝突互毆，學生被抓去者達六十餘人，受傷者十餘人，一部學生逃至政大求援，政大學生集合數百人，前往救援，又與軍官隊相遇，復有十餘人受傷，其中二人重傷，（一名丁雍平，一為女生田文慧），中大學生據報，乃整隊赴總統府請願，（時已六時）要求懲兇賠償醫藥費等。在大中橋附近之軍官隊，亦聞訊當卽強佔劇專遊行之卡車數輛，駛往總統府，與中大學生，再度發生衝突。治安當局防繼續出事，提早於十時戒嚴，學生無法行動，故死傷人數，迄未查明，惟知傷者多已送醫院，聞有學生十人，尚無下落，本日參加遊行之學生，有政大·中大·金大·金女大·劇專·建國·法商學院·東方語專等十一個學校。約計學生五千餘人。</p>

<h3 id="c5">衛總發言人談衝突經過 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕首都衛戌總部發言人政工處長羅春波，一日晚九時在該部招待首都中外記者卅餘人，首由政院發言人鮑靜安報告，謂何院長對本日京市大專學生因遊行與軍官總隊第三大隊官兵衝突事，除表示甚為遺憾並予以重視外，已令有關當局查明責任作公平處理。旋由羅處長報告衝突經過，詳情如下：（一）羅首謂此次學生遊行，衛總昨日下午卽接得情報，曾勸阻本京所有十一個專科以上學校，不必舉行，嗣經請示總統府及政院，奉指示應予勸導，如不聽，則聽其遊行，但須沿途保護，並注意維持其秩序；（二）本部接奉指示後，卽令飭各警憲加緊維持治安，計自今晨九時起，由各校集合於四牌樓之大專學生，漸增至四五千人，十一時起，卽由劇專為前導，整隊出發　，首至總統府請願，繼卽循國府路，沿主要大路，至白下路，沿途散發傳單，張貼標語，高呼口號，並由各校組成之宣傳隊，向道旁羣眾舉行個別宣傳，但截至二時，該遊行行列解散止，秩序井然，迄未發生任何意外。（三）至二時許，初未料衛總突接南區警局報告，謂遊行中一部學生於解散後，至大光路大中橋，意欲向軍官總隊第三大隊官兵（按該隊皆係於作戰時被共軍俘虜後歸來官兵）進行宣傳，該隊拒不之納，學生乃於該隊門首，遍貼標語，同時並散發傳單，軍官隊隊員乃動手撕其傳單標語，因此遂由口角而致動武互毆，衛總得南區警局報告後，經派員彈壓調解，並將雙方受傷者各數十人送醫院療治後，事態本已平息，詎學生方面於毆鬥發生後，有一部分別回校求援，重新集合者達二千餘人，軍官總隊方面為不願示弱，亦有增援，於是彼此報復，互毆又復開始，情形更烈。本部爰又派員前往調解。此時學生方面因衝突擴大後，遂有主張更赴總統府請願者，而軍官總隊亦卽隨後尾追，致至國府路時，乃又發生毆鬥，當時情形紊亂，衛總隨往彈壓，官佐亦有二人受傷。至此，總司令始不得不令調特務團參加鎮壓，並嚴令軍官總隊隊員如再不聽，就地格殺不論，當時由衛總逮捕之軍官隊隊員共凡八人。至八時始將軍官隊隊員集合歸隊，傷者送院，事態至此始告平息。（四）受傷人數據衛總統計，在大光路大光新村軍官總隊部第一次受重傷者計學生六，輕傷者六十六，共七十二人，第二次受重傷者五，輕傷者廿四，共廿九人。軍官總隊方面第一次受輕傷者四十八人，重傷及第二次受傷五。以上總計學生受重傷者十一，輕者一〇一，共一一二人，軍官總隊四十人，雙方總數為一六〇人。（五）事發後，衛總已將受傷者分送鼓樓中央兩醫院，輕傷者於代為包紮換藥後，分別護送回校，故自始自終，除軍官隊隊員七人迄尚在本部拘押中外，（另一人嫌疑犯格桑卻培（藏籍）已開釋）衛總從未逮捕任何學生。（六）總之，此次學生與收容總隊隊員發生衝突，全係一偶發事件，事先軍官收容總隊旣未知學生欲來宣傳，學生亦未事先通知該隊欲往宣傳，致遂因雙方對事情看法不同，一時因感情激動而發生衝突，至本案將來如何處理，當予多方詳加調查後，請求上峯辦理之。羅處長於報告終了後，最後並由該部拘押之七名軍官隊員章成方李培根等報告衝突經過亦甚詳盡。</p>

<p>和談代表團一行，終於在這個西諺的扯謊日子（四月一日）裏，不扯謊的走了，趕到飛機塲送行的，除官塲人物而外，以民意代表，立法委員居多。</p>
<p>代表們到得最早也最受人注目的是老牌和平老人邵力子，他走到那裏，大家就包圍到那裏，一片笑聲，一陣擁擠，于右老為了找他，也走來走去。邵夫人要他不要走，他說：「有什麽關係，他們散步散步」，大家都鬨然大笑。</p>
<p>新聞記者包圍邵老，他是盡量的不停的走路，請他坐下來，他不肯，於是這個包圍圈就成了游擊隊，游來游去。有人說：「這是後輩包圍前輩」，因為邵老是老記者。</p>
<p>代表團出發人員的名單，總是秘而不宣，新聞記者到處採訪不得，只好求之於過鎊的名單，結果未卜先知，他們只用號碼代替，因此記者只好在體重上猜，如五十四公斤的，可能是章士釗，六十五公斤的可能是張治中等。</p>
<p>張羣一到機塲就向張治中問：「邵先生呢？邵先生呢」？等找到時，二張一邵連說：「我們有私話，有私話」，逃出記者的包圍圈，去開「三人小組會議」去了。</p>
<p>邵老是一臉笑迷迷而心思沉重的人，今天和張羣小談一回後握別時，邵老卻說一句：「我不會太悲觀的，你放心好了」。張羣再說出兩個字：「軍事」，邵老再度點首表示「知道了」。這份沉重，一直到張羣待飛機騰空而去以後，還低下着頭。</p>

<h3 id="c11">和談開始進行了 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>政府和談代表團一行六人，由「和平將軍」張治中氏率領，已於昨晨春光明媚之中，自京飛平，與中共代表團開始談判了。這次和談的進行，不僅是國共兩方的釋嫌修好，而且有關整個的國脈民命，尤其對於歷經戰禍的全國人民，不啻是黑暗中的一綫光明，售後全國人民能否脫離水火，而實現其幸福與愉快的生活，將視這次和談的結果如何而定。所以，全國人民，不論南北，不分男女，不問老幼，昨天莫不以迫切的心情，目送政府和談代表團的北飛，并殷懃祝望代表北上「只許成功，不許失敗」。我們站在人民的立場，乘此和談剛剛開始之際，提出幾點意見，以供國共雙方和談代表的參考。</p>
<p>第一，國共兩方的和談代表，必須站在人民的立場。我們對於「主權在民」或「人民世紀」之類的理論，雖不過分迷信，但相信人民的力量是偉大的，民意的歸趨是不可違抗的。任何政府如若脫離人民，不論其所擁有的武力如何強大，終有垮台的一天；任何政黨，不問其聲勢如何浩大，但若沒有民眾為基礎，一味迷信武力，戰爭到底，也是必歸於失敗的。這種歷史的教訓，史不絕書，不勝枚舉。此必為國共兩方的和談代表所諗知。記得民國十五六年國民黨北伐時，稱自己的軍隊為國民革命軍，今日中共也稱其軍隊為「人民解放軍」，「國民」與「人民」在字面上雖有差別，但其含義則一，如譯為英文，同為People。所以今日國共雙方進行和談，必須站在人民的立場。否則就要失去和談的意義。</p>
<p>第二，唯有在「人民的利益高於一切」的原則之下進行和談，和談始有光明的前途。國共兩方之間的悲歡離合，已有三十年的歷史，彼此之間的新仇舊恨擢髮難數，今日和談如仍不忘報復主義，堅持血的債要用血來償的話，則我們可以武斷地說，和談絕無前途可言。反之，雙方代表如能放棄小我的成見，而能從大處着眼，以人民的利益與國家的幸福為前提，則天下決沒有不可解除的仇恨，尤其是政黨與政黨之間的政爭，成功不能引以為榮，失敗也不必認為奇恥大辱。「成則為王，敗則為寇」的陳腐觀念，決不能容許它遺留於今日政黨政治的時代。我們特別要提醒雙方和談代表，國共雙方動輒以「為國為民」相標榜，人民早已聽夠了，誰真誰假，這次和談倒是一個絕好的試金石。今日全國人民在戰亂的煎熬之下，再也活不下去了，國家民族也已到了存亡絕續的開頭，局勢的嚴重甚於抗戰初期國共合作的時候，雙方如若還不能抱頭痛哭，釋嫌修好，團結一致，建設一個獨立·富強·康樂·自由的新中國，還說什麼「為國為民」！不論是那一方面必為人民所共棄。</p>
<p>第三，我們還要進一步指出，何謂人民立場？何謂人民利益？老實說，不論是政府區的老百姓，或是中共控制區的人民，他們的立場是一致的，他們的利益也是相同的，質言之，他們的立場就是和平，他們的得益就是和平。和平至上，和平第一，和平高於一切。我們希望政府代表此次北上和談，一方面要以江南人民生活於水深火熱之中的情形以及迫切渴望和平的心理，詳細告訴中共代表，使他們悄然大悟，此時言和最能得民心，但若不顧人民的死活，一意孤行，必為人民所共棄。此在另一方面政府代表猶應在和談之餘，隨時考察中共區人民的生活及其興情，使全國人民在地理上儘管有政府區與中共區之分，但在感情上仍是整個的，不可分離的，使這個民意有無上的權威，教國共任何一方面，都不能固執其一黨一已之私，而不得不順從民意而達成和談的任務。</p>
<p>政府代表離京時會發表書面談話，一則表示他們的心情如臨深淵，如履薄冰，深感此次和談為國脈民命所繫；另則又指出雙方如能在互信互諒互讓的精神下和談，并無不可克服的難題。這種不卑不亢的態度，實事求是的精神，實在值得我們的欽佩，必為全國人民所一致支援；同時我們但願中共代表也抱着這種「但問耕耘不問收穫」的精神，平心靜氣坐下來，與政府代表進行和談，雙方果能相見以誠，相忍為和，則和談的前途是光明的。即使在和談的行程之中，波折迭起，只要全國的人民能隨時發揮主人翁的力量，從旁督促，隻許成功不許失敗，將來的結果，必能使國共雙方釋嫌修好，必能使全國化戾氣為祥和，在中國的天際撥開戰亂煙霧而透射出和平的陽光來！</p>
<h3 id="c12">查獲私運現鈔　匿報數額朋分　青島警備部內人員　執法犯法貪污　劉安祺震怒警部同人俱深憤慨　參謀長免職督察長等已被扣押 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>〔本報青島一日電〕青島警備司令部返發生一貪污案，執法犯法，牽涉頗多，其中竟涉及警備部參謀長黃公魯等。綏區司令官兼警備司令劉安祺獲悉，大為震怒，將黃先行免職，改調綏區高參，遺缺由綏區副參謀長何繼厚接充。警備部督察室督察長張通，小港檢查站站長余敬臣扣押，交由警備部軍法室嚴密偵查，核報辦理。此案不惟各界流傳特議紛紜，綏區警部同人對此敗毀紀綱行為，亦俱深憤慨。</p>
<p>發生經過　偵查有眉目</p>
<p>警部軍法室自上月廿二日接得該案後，本軍法尊嚴之精神，連續偵訊。據軍法官黨志賢稱：渠五晝夜未得安眠，惟在偵查期間，對內對外均未便發表，刻已有具體眉目，犯罪嫌疑極為重大，或須組會審法庭，宣判之後當層呈批核。該案發生經過如下：上月十三日，警備部小港檢查站查獲某商由某地走私運來金圓劵三千八百萬，分裝若干麻袋，如按照綏區二月廿二日施行之限制現款入境辦法，僅準每人携帶十萬元，逾額一經查出，即解央行凍結，逐日限額提存，每日一萬元，（最近幣值變動，似未聞有所變動）如按走私關係深究，自必另有發現。詎知該項鉅款一經查獲，該檢查站長余敬臣與督察長張通等擅自發還二千萬元，扣留一千八百萬，呈報警部處理，由參謀長簽辦時，竟謊報為一百八十萬元，刪去一圈，以一千六百廿萬元分入私囊。此事發生後，道途紛傳，旋經人向劉安祺司令官密告，始告敗露。當扣押張通時，在其寓處搜出黃金廿五兩，美金一百五十元。據悉：張通等已在軍法室經過情形和盤託出，且頗多牽涉，另一消息稱：黃公魯僅有失職之嫌云云。目前趨勢，張通似有負主要罪責可能，惟眾信此一中校督察長不致有此獨當魄當魄力。據何繼厚參謀長稱：青島環境複雜，警備部工作至感重要，關於前任此案，渠不錶意見，惟依法辦理。軍法官黨志賢業已傳詢若干關係人，惟款主方面尚未傳及。</p>
<p>販煙土案　亦在偵訊中</p>
<p>另一消息稱：上月十三日本市辭鄉路六十九號海陽人宋紹斤，劉品三，余錫候等，經人密告設立字號，在共區走私，販運煙土等情，當晚經軍警憲加以搜查，張通亦為搜查人之一，據悉查獲可疑賬單及其他可疑賬單及其他可疑物件，渠等刻仍押警備部，全案尚未發表。據悉：此案亦在偵訊範圍以內。</p>

<p>〔聯合社莫斯科一日電〕蘇聯昨日以備忘錄分送發起北大西洋條約之英美法加比荷盧七國政府，斥此約為對蘇公開侵略，破壞五項國際協定。莫斯科各晨報均在封面登載備忘錄全文，但未有評論發表。備忘錄中之結論有以下三點：（一）北大西洋條約具有公開之侵略性質，且係針對蘇聯。（二）違反聯合國憲章。（三）破壞英蘇與法友好不侵犯條約，雅爾達協定及波茨坦協定。蘇聯不承認條約中所稱此約係嚴格防禦性及遵守聯合國原則，謂美英法三國之正式代表已切實指出此約係對蘇聯及東歐其他共產國家。參加各國皆在作軍事準備，如積存原子彈等，　非防禦性質。參加各國在華盛頓保存上次戰爭之英美聯合參謀部，在巴黎郊外之方丹白　設立西歐聯防機構，今又擬在新條約下設立一防務委員會。凡此均足增加不安與恐慌，激起戰爭歇斯的里亞。此約目的實為恐嚇不願服從英美集團命令之各國。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓一日廣播：美國務院發言人頃斷然否認蘇聯所稱北大西洋公約之目的在於進攻蘇聯之說。該發言人稱，蘇聯此項宣傳，用意徒欲造成紛亂。但美官方對蘇聯之指責並不感覺驚異。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓一日電〕蘇聯向北大西洋公約諸簽字國提出抗議後，此間卽時的反響，乃為此舉較一月廿九日蘇聯政府的外交政策聲明，並無重要的進步。蘇抗議書僅事譴責大西洋公約而未要求有所行動，顯示莫斯科將擬將此一抗議作為一種宣傳姿態，而並非一種外交上真正的抗議行動。</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦一日電〕英外部發言人就蘇聯照會抗議北大西洋公約事稱，史達林及列寗曾謂世界必分裂為二部，今蘇聯重唱此調，實屬遺憾。渠繼稱，英政府將及時正式答覆蘇聯照會。覆文大約將指出貝文外相上月十八日在下院所稱大西洋公約幷無秘密條款，凡無侵略目的或意向之國，毋須害怕此一公約。蘇聯今日似已預奠基礎，與西方完全斷絕關係以對抗大西洋公約。此點可能包括蘇聯退出聯合國，如蘇聯選擇此一激烈方法。</p>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎一日電〕法外部發言人一日稱，蘇聯照會指斥大西洋公約係旨在反蘇之聯盟，此點「毫無根據」。提及一九四四年法蘇協定時，該發言人強調該協定與大西洋公約幷無衝突之處。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓一日廣播：法外長許曼與艾契遜商談一小時半後談稱，「吾人曾就若干有關主要問題，包括德國問題在內，交換意見，雖因時間短促，不及詳談，但至少已獲得其梗概。余希望在余留美期間各項問題咸能獲致良好結果」。許氏謂，「關於義殖民地問題何時開始討論，尚不可知，但此事旣已列入聯大議程，無需余再行提出」。</p>

<p>〔合眾社華盛頓卅一日電〕美國務院條約司正在想一個兩全其美的辦法，避免邀請蘇駐美大使潘友新出席大西洋公約之簽署典禮。條約司的專家在這一週中，為了解決這事，費煞腦筋。像這種公約的簽署典禮，在禮節上應該邀請在美所有的外交使節，當然潘友新在內，通常另外一個辦法就是一個亦不邀請。但是國務院祇要邀請同情大西洋公約的外國使節，似乎有兩個辦法，或許潘氏不會前來，索性邀請所有外國使節，碰碰額角頭，或許潘氏拒絕出席典禮。（二）冒一下險，祇邀請美國所歡迎的外國使節，對蘇聯央譴。現在禮賓當局認為他們終已尋出一方法，因外傳願意參加此項典禮的外國使節已經暗示過，假如潘友新真的來了怎麽樣？那祇有天曉得。</p>

<p>〔路透社麻州波斯頓卅一日電〕邱吉爾今晚向麻州理工大學發表舉世矚目之演說，指中印兩國之被併入克林姆宮所控制的共產帝國以內，無疑的將對八億至九億人民，帶來無限的流血與痛苦。邱翁又說，美國若不掌握原子彈，則在若干時前，歐洲可能已經赤化，倫敦亦可能已受轟炸。邱翁指責克林姆宮中之十三巨頭，壓制數萬萬的人民，企圖統治全世界。今日的歐洲已被籠罩在恐懼的陰影之下。</p>
<p>邱翁並大聲疾呼：我們必須同時顧及亞洲及歐洲，在歐洲的地位，幸賴柏林空運而得以保持，但在亞洲方面，中國之屈服於共產黨進攻及陰謀之下，實為二次世界大戰中盟國獲勝以來最劣的慘劇。</p>
<p>較希魔更狡滑</p>
<p>基督文化，今已面臨較希特勒更狡滑更強大的勢力，英語民族之團結，乃目前唯一自救之道。在克林姆宮之後，有派在每一國之使者為其第五縱隊，有世界最大的陸軍，為實行較沙皇或德帝更甚的帝國主義擴張政策的政府所掌握。但邱翁又曰：戰爭並非不可避免，渠不主張卽採暴力行動，希望與忍耐，尚不可卽行放棄，許多有益的方法已在發動之中。在共產主義威脅之下，自由國家已從事空前絕後的團結。邱翁力言我們對於蘇聯人民並無敵意，亦無意否認彼等合法的權利及安全，我們的目標及主義繼續不變，願意視世界各地的俄人為人類家庭中的弟兄，我們所要求於蘇聯者，祇為善意及公允的態度。但是，如神經戰已經發動，那麽我們務必養成我們堅強的神經，我們將團結一切思想及超人的科學，以保衛自由，此乃避免第三次世界戰爭最好的方法，亦為不受奴役及毀滅而渡過此一危機最確切的辦法。</p>
<p>聽眾一萬餘人</p>
<p>英國的戰時首相邱吉爾在波斯頓花園麻州理工大學的紀念會中發表演說，在塲聽眾一萬四千人，而英國三大廣播公司，亦以廣播機及傳真機將邱翁之演辭，傳至各地。他的聽眾，包括若干世界最著名的科學家在內，都聚精會神，咀嚼這一位當代第一位演說家的演辭。邱翁演說終了時的數焗，使人回憶及他在戰時著名的演說，他說：「讓我們奮勇前進履行我們的使命與責任，除了上帝以外，沒有任何畏懼。」邱翁演說中之其他要點如下：他說二十世紀特點之一，乃為更多的人已能分享前此少數人所特享的生活，我們各願將每一土地上的羣眾，均能豐衣足食，那麽祇有不斷的改進技術生產，及改良千百萬男女人民的教育，卽使在目前黑暗的時期，本人仍相信可以做到這一點。我們現在有近代科學的一切資源，如果仍不能避免世界的飢荒，應該歸咎於我們全體，而科學家尤應負責，科學家如不能做到這一點，則人類必將因享受不平均而起衝突。</p>
<p>避免三次大戰</p>
<p>邱翁並曰聯合國機構，已因蘇聯的敵視及共產主義與其他人類間的分裂而喪失效用，但我們不必沮喪，必須將一切超人的思想與科學力量團結起來以保衛自由，這是避免第三次世界戰爭的最好希望，亦為避免收復及毀滅的唯一辦法。蘇聯畏懼西方國家的友誼更在西方國家的敵視之上，因此蘇聯已採用驚人的政策，不允在他控制的區域內發展友好關係。邱翁認為二十世紀為一充滿風暴與變化的世紀。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中華基督教靑年會全國學生救濟委員會，上海學生救濟會，中華營養促進會及國際學生禮拜堂，福利委員會等團體代表多人，昨日下午四時，赴同濟及復旦兩校參觀學生伙食情形，並邀記者同往。緣學生救濟會最近接獲一羣國立大學公費學生去信，申述三月份公費共八千元，除米柴油鹽與必需開支外，其中菜金祇二千元，平均每天為六十四元，因之所吃祇能是「空了心的蘿葡」和「開了花的菜尖」毫無營養可言。一部份自費與半自費學生更連此數亦無力繳納，將被迫停膳。中華營養促進會為此曾就學生營養之恶劣情形加以分析，學生救濟會並就學生健康情形加以調查，結果發現患肺病者所佔之百分比甚高，此一嚴重現象，全由於營養不良而起。同濟學生現每日祇食二餐，採取分食制，所吃為紅米飯加少許無油水之靑菜。復旦學生則八人一桌，所吃亦為兩樣素菜。有錢之學生可添菜佐餐，無錢者祇能日以此無營養之飯菜下咽，且菜量有限，一碗飯後，菜肴無剩，遂單以紅米飯充飢。昨日參觀之代表目睹此種情形，一致認為亟須加以救濟改善，否則數年大學教育所造就者祇為許多營養不良患肺病之靑年。學生救濟會為此正研究擬為窮苦學生經常添菜佐餐，以補營養之不足。但該會因國外補助之經費有限，希望社會各界及政府均能顧及此一嚴重問題，予窮苦學生吃飽及適當之營養。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨天是一九四九年度的「愚人節」，各方面人士早就深懷戒心，唯恐受愚，但是存心愚人的消息，一日間仍舊出現了很多。最動人的是傳說貝祖貽自美電告，白銀貸款已經美政府核准五億盎斯，國行並且派定林崇墉卽赴華盛頓接洽運輸事宜了。這消息起初頗使市塲上興高采烈的一羣多頭感到愣然，不過經兩個頭腦比較淸醒的一指斥，交易依舊照老路進行，沒有發生絲毫影響，另外在中午時分，寫字間區有很多人奔相走告：李代總統已於淸晨下令停戰，毛澤東又在發腦充血舊症，還有宋子文突然遇刺殞命等等，據說這都是南京方面來的急電，千真萬確，但是結果呢，一打聽，還不是一笑置之。</p>
<p>愚人的消息並未就此終止，下午又有人說張學良被釋到滬了，下楊國際飯店，害得記者們跑到國際去釘住林經理問了好幾趟。有幾張晚報登出了市府交際科長劉班業小姐下午在華懋飯店訂婚，但是新聞中根本沒有她的「先生」的名字。還有說新聞處長朱虛白中了上期慈善獎券的頭獎，朱對人表示：「要是真的，那可多麽好！」還有個恶劣的，要算是范雪君了，某報說她前夜服毒殉情，已定昨午在中國殯儀館大殮，旁邊還刊出一張「遺像」。天曉得，范雪君昨天下午還在興冲冲地趕各書塲的塲子呢！</p>
<p>本報前天接到一位讀者投稿，其中說「靑年文學家孫約翰已在國際十四樓跳樓自殺」，信內還附了一幀孫的照片，樣子很英俊，這當然是條好新聞，但是經記者細細翻閱，破綻出現了，大概這位尋開心的朋友沒有留意，他的信內說孫自殺時間在卅一日下午五時許，而我們當日接信的色，還沒到四點鍾呐！</p>

<p>在這浙江的東北邊緣上，無疑地有着以不安著稱的太湖，形勢複雜的蘇浙皖邊區，瀕臨東海的國境綫，所以地位相當重要，浙江省政府把她劃為第一區。由於樹巒氏担任行政督察專員，於氏在這一地區担任專員，已經十年於茲，而浙省府也已西易主席了。在於氏的治理下，這一地區確很平靜，最近浙省東南西各地區都不十分安定，卽記者才別四月很平安的臨安，也有風聲鶴唳的景象，而獨東北的邊區，還是靜靜地，平安地沒有什麼動亂。記者此番再度搭着浙省公路聯營處為記者團特備的專車，去到吳興一帶，加以實地考察，深覺在長興這一蘇浙皖的邊境，僅一山之隔，便是共軍活動的區域，太湖浩翰，湖中的東山西山也為共軍時常出沒之所，而對這一邊有地區却始終還保持着平寗無事，如三十七年度吳興與嘉興兩縣發生的刦案九起，嘉善發生的四起，崇德發生的二起，海鹽發生三起，全年共二十七起，其他各縣，都沒有盜案發生，可謂差可滿意的平安地區。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市塲，晨開交易一度混亂，因央行五千一萬大鈔發行，各方人心興奮，喊高至九八萬五千漲停，有求無供，買賣擯持良久。迄十時光景，央行委託大德成金號以九八萬三千，猛出二六二九大條，軋進頭寸達二五八億四千餘萬，人心轉平，買氣緩和，交易頓告開朗，步小至九七萬九千。午收九八萬。</p>
<p>午後因傳白銀貸款成功，若干行莊有搖動之說，銀根緊俏，暗息昂達一元二角，人心虛軟，賣氣濃厚，銀行幫證券幫紛紛出籠，開盤九七萬五千，一路小至九五萬。臨收因銀樓幫稍有吸胃，回升至九六萬四千，較上日漲六萬九千。合息僅七角五分光景，同業劃賬價格，上午為九八萬一千，下午為九六萬二千五。</p>

<p>銀元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元套進，因連日價格狂漲，與外埠脫節甚遠，各幫消化轉趨廖落，更傳銀本位實行在卽，風險頗大，故承做者轉少，全日做開華南華西等地，僅五十萬左右。馬路交易因散戶去化活躍，市勢繼續上漲，大頭晨喊一萬七，一萬八，一度曾升至一萬七千五，一萬八千五。午後稍低至一萬七，一萬八，小頭喊一萬四，一萬五，龍鷹洋喊一萬一，一萬二，錢兌幫煙紙幫對敲交易頗堅，上午大頭當日支票，一度做高至二萬，二萬二，午後小至一萬九，二萬一。隔日加息二千，做高至二萬一，二萬三，較上日漲六千。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日全日銀根由鬆轉緊，晨開日拆每千元七十五元，後因國行拋金，抽緊銀根，迄午直升至九十元。午後傳有若干行莊不穩，銀根更緊，暗拆高至千元一百二十元，最後為日拆一百元左右。昨日國行共拋金二萬四千兩，抽住頭寸在二百億以上，為最近國行屢次拋售中規模最大之一次，金融性商品行情受此打擊，全日未有起色。昨日行局共差出一百六十五億，洋商銀行差出八億，大交換差進五十一億，小交換差進一百廿二億。</p>

<p>食米因大票發行，人心大受刺激，貨主狂抬價格，造成空前之劇漲，初開展一萬五千，後貨主再扳高，薄稻一度曾做十二萬五千元，收市自知狂漲過度，貨主吐售，疾退七八千，收市薄稻十一萬八千，仍較昨狂升二萬五千，有二成半多。北市塲白粳十一萬七千，特粳十二萬三千元，一致狂升二萬多元，二市到貨共計三八一三石。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>漲風重起，因發行大票，貨主狂扳價格，更受米價暴漲之影響，人心更堅俏非凡。豆油漲八萬，生菜油開市漲九萬，後回小三萬元，計升六萬。生油亦漲六萬元，豆餅獨因銷路不好，略漲二三千。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>漲勢變本加厲，緣因大鈔發行，刺激人心，且米價激升，晨開各牌粉一律越破四關，收市老車高達四萬四千五百元，兵船北幫納進仍力，市勢步步挺升，後市升達四萬二千五百元，較前再晋升二成。麩皮客銷極暢，跟升二成餘，大包做三萬六千五百元。</p>

<p>— 看台客</p>
<p>愚人節央行動腦筋　美貸銀原是尋開心</p>
<p>昨天是愚人節，循例可以騙人，不騙人不算摩登。所以笑話百出。</p>
<p>在袁頭大跳當口，中央銀行也大尋開心。該行新聞處向記者，公開發表談話，說華盛頓電訊，美國對華白銀貸款，已經談判成功。</p>
<p>這一消息，傳到市塲。人心一慌，袁頭首當其衝，一度下瀉。但不久就被識破，重見回騰，反動尤烈。</p>
<p>害人不淺的本票，昨天愈演愈醜。</p>
<p>四川路江西路一帶，銀元販子，手持一疊本票，大呼「阿要中央銀行本票，一萬作九千」。</p>
<p>記者因事經過這二條路，來兜賣央行本票的人，不下十多次。他們臨走時都說：「兜來兜去，嘸人要」。</p>
<p>據說：下週起，國家行局要獨佔本票發行權了。將不准商業行莊發行本票。</p>
<p>此說如果屬實，又替世界銀行法及票據法，重新改良過。但事實上，恐怕不確實。因為銀錢業發行本票，旨在代現。如不准行莊發本票，除非央行充分供給現鈔頭寸；並對每一客戶提現時，由央行加派警察保護運送。客戶大量提現時所以要行莊發本票，旨在避免運現時的危險也。如不准行莊發本票，行莊只好付現鈔。那末客戶運現的風險，應由央行負担。</p>
<p>銀根緊行莊動搖　大局中步步留心</p>
<p>銀根緊勢有增無減。</p>
<p>然則昨天行局卻差出一百多億之巨。可見市上吃口之大容量之廣了。</p>
<p>行莊動搖的消息，昨天更覺凶險，據說有廿多家，名號都歷歷可數，其中且有歷史悠久者也在內。</p>
<p>現鈔荒不解除，票據亂用之風不消除。行莊的危險，正方興未艾哩！因為客戶收到的票據，都要迅速付出，不必再解戶頭。因為解戶頭，不僅是費時費力，而且還要賠一天利息。</p>
<p>講到賠利息，賬要算在禁止票據當日抵現上。但也是行莊乘機利用，貪圖佔一天利息的便宜。所以又是自扳石頭壓自腳的把戲。</p>
<p>今天的消息，還不致能使市面變。但要切實當心啊！今後幾天的市面，隨時會有大風潮的可能。</p>
<p>但萬變變不壞金鈔銀元和米煤，別的都有風險；風險農飆的可能是股票。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華股市況，晨因商業行莊緊縮拆放，供況較滯。更聞央行將大量拋售金銀物資，人心頗多固慮，雖大額本票發行，塲外貼息開低等利多因素，終因暗息尚高，空方壓力仍重，市勢演成盤局。永紗晨開十二元，隔夜舊多頻吐，步挫至十一元三角，三角半，金紗幫不斷補吸，又升至十二元六角新高價。嗣後黃金壓小，銀根緊勢加重，各幫拋售齊起，午收又回挫至十一元九角。</p>
<p>中小型股晨開走勢尚穩，中間波動甚劇，臨收均告穩定。新光初開一元一二，一度哄高至一元二五，小見一元〇六分，近午仍以幕後強力拉抬，終見一元二角高盤收束。美亞初開三元八角，高見三元九角，劇跌至三元三角五分，午收為三元六五。景福景綸勤興信和開後一路軟弱，中間一度盤高，臨收仍又回軟，結果微見軋升。其餘各股漲跌互見。</p>
<p>後市央行拋金後，銀根走勢較前市趨緊。初開一度低徊，臨收前空抵補，買氣轉旺，永紗曾漲達停板收市。餘股多種漲停，雜牌股除新亞反跌三角二分外，其餘均升二成許。全日成交四八億二千一百四十萬股。</p>
<p>外股市勢昨日塲外走勢仍堅，晨開各股均趨俏俐，怡紗做三萬，三萬二，英聯三五〇〇〇元，三七〇〇〇元，升三〇〇〇元。業廣九五〇〇元，一〇〇〇〇元，升一〇〇〇元。亞洲做三三〇〇元，三四〇〇元，會德豐做十一萬，一一五〇〇〇元，升一〇〇〇〇元。餘股均秀。</p>

<p>昨日棉紗續見秀挺，業內銀根緊勢未已，客幫大多抱觀望態度，本街亦無大量做開，晨初各紗均現高檔，近午散多需單者紛圖脫手，最後價微告回落。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳始開竟高達七百十二萬元，迄收始迫入六百九十二萬元，結果較前挺五十二萬元。四〇支藍鳳漲起五十五萬元，三二支銀月軋升三十三萬元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨目三百四十八萬元開出後，甫俏至三百五十萬元，收前一度做小至三百四十一萬元，終為三百四十四萬元，好起二十萬元。二〇支雙馬最後做三百三十一萬元，終挺二十四萬元，一六支以下各級亦略見帶俏。</p>

<p>— 大禾</p>
<p>又是週末，足球迷要到逸園。上海的足球現在雖然分成三個壁壘，不過跑馬廳內洋鬼子的比賽，門口掛了閑人免進的招牌，漁卹無路問津，不必去說它。南市場上，週六週末是「例假」，所以，週末談足球，還是談談逸園之戰。</p>
<p>星期六的下午，逸園一時一刻開賽，幼級盃螢光與磐隊唱開鑼，這兩隊都是後起之精銳，年少力壯，長江裏的後浪也。</p>
<p>三時半鐘，中航對志超，這場比賽，頗有苗頣，談戰績中航在第一循</p>
<p>環中以一比〇奏捷，此番再逢，志超必謀雪恥。</p>
<p>不過，中航近來氣燄甚盛，市長盃賽裏　二比一淘汰青白，是三年來第一個擊破青白長勝銜的一隊，這個螢光，確是中航的無上光榮。雖然決賽中吃了敗仗，但是任何球迷都有「這是中航造的機會」的想頭，所以，志超雖然拼命有心，然而贏球卻是大成問題了。</p>
<p>志超以吳祺祥為全隊攻守之靈魂，但祺祥最近因事對踢球不感興趣，此番出場，惹人繫念。</p>
<p>中航的守力并不堅强，事實上，內裏祇有徐福生一度小鐵門，後衛綫上也僅得謝錫川撑市面，中衛綫更其力弱，金川瀚還可派用場，其餘兩人都不大靠得住。</p>
<p>志超之攻，問題在於如何叩射福生，福生的前面如果有謝錫川，金川瀚掩護，志超的前鋒并無廿碼處叩關的腳頭，中航可一穩如泰山的。</p>
<p>因此，志超之攻，應多用兩翼，右翼之攻，應沿邊直下，誘出謝錫川，然後塞入中路，最好方法當然是一腳遠傳左翼，然而腳頭造詣，恐怕無此可能。</p>
<p>右翼如果能够引小謝離開門前，當中便有突入的機會，左翼則宜切入衝射而不宜傳中，因為如果高傳，必難以過小謝的關頭了。</p>
<p>中航要攻破志超之關，第一要想辦法越過吳祺祥的一關，不過這一關相當難越。</p>
<p>精武曾經擊敗志超，所用的方法，足為中航借鏡。</p>
<p>那方法是：中鋒略為退後，然後揮兩翼切入，兩內鋒齊進，這個方法，對付善於掩護球門的中堅，特別有效，因為中鋒退後，如果中堅出來，那已經失了第三後衛的意義，兩翼有長驅直下的可能，如果中堅仍在內裏，那麼，兩內鋒可以互易位置的進攻法，使中堅以一對二難以看管。</p>
<p>中航在這場比賽中，應以徐祖國踢翼鋒，高秀清作退後式的中鋒，如能如此排陣，當可再勝志超也。</p>
<p>星期日，青白對龍頭，下午三時半舉行。</p>
<p>這場球應是大賽之一，劇戰可期。</p>
<p>青白在市長盃觸霉頭之後，紙老虎被人拆穿，阿福不出來率領三軍，使青白的陣容失去進攻的威力，對付北方之强的龍頭，未易言勝。</p>
<p>事實上，對付青白，第一着是釘牢小羅，小羅是根輸血管，也是一員射門者，上海目下各隊中，更沒有一個內鋒能够和小羅媲美，然而這是青白的强點，拆穿來也是弱點，衹是把小羅控制得住，青白的前鋒也就生路缺缺。</p>
<p>金祿生的竄射固然可畏，但如果沒有小羅覓隙開路，也是徒然的。</p>
<p>青白的右路攻勢并不强，看得牢左方，右方也不會出毛病。</p>
<p>贏青白的第二着是針對青白之守而作進攻之路。中路有孟義良，老孟門檻甚精，如果向這一點加壓力，必然事半而攻倍。三毛的一邊，守衛也異常穩固，不過薛沛然喜歡遠出助攻，够速度的內鋒如與左翼及時搭檔，也有過三毛之關的可能。左方是青白守衛較弱的一環，錢長榮不在狀態中，張仁義不是後衛長才，這兩人任何一個守關，都有機會可趁。</p>
<p>但青白之强點在中衛綫，薛沛然伏乃棠均會控制中場，龍頭必須在中場取得優勢，才可以有擊敗青白的能力，否則讓沛然帶球出來，小羅得以活動，龍頭後防便會變生肘腋了。</p>

<p>四屆籃球聯賽甲一組，轉戰迄今，已臨最後階段，尚餘五戰，至四月八日可全部結束，冠軍一席華聯蟬聯毫無問題，亞軍仁餘希望最濃，而今晚再逢滬警一仗，亦相當關係，賽前另有女子及甲二組各一場，於五時半開始，門票調整為樓黎队上一千五百元，樓下三千元，及場內對號五千元。秩序與裁判先錄如下：</p>

<p>女子組尚餘兩場，今日為黎隊與力隊狹路重遇，黎隊本屆崛起娘子軍中，鬥力彌强，今日當可再敗力隊奪獲亞軍，力隊勝利無望，殿軍一席非彼莫屬，然諸新將奮鬥精神不懈，殊值得嘉獎屆時必能頑抗到底。</p>
<p>甲二C部美氣象對健樂，為該部主力之戰，美氣象常勝不敗，健樂除敗於胖隊外，每戰俱捷，屆時如能一鼓而擒番兵，冠軍或有染指之望，惟美氣象主將泊透改投恩卡斯，實力依然可觀，健樂諸將宜謹慎應付，殫智竭慮，以爭取勝利。</p>
<p>甲一組仁餘對滬警，仁餘係最後一課，日前該隊甫大敗海青，充份發揮其威力，徐仲呂·吳新運·沈鵬舉·姚文彝等，各具絕技，且該隊戰績為九勝四負，亞軍呼聲最高，而今晚如擊潰滬警則將成鐵案，無法動搖其亞軍寶座矣。</p>
<p>滬警六勝五負，尚餘三場，雖無關宏旨，然與名次極有出進，今晚之戰倘獲勝利，亞軍尚具一綫希望，否則恐季軍亦將不保也，故全隊必出全力死拼，況滬警於首循中聲勢極盛，因遭仁餘之猛頭一擊而洩氣，此番寃家重逢，更圖一報宿仇，雙方勢均力敵，惡戰不免，六隊名單如下：</p>

<p>龍頭足球隊昨在南市民主盃賽中憑最後五分鐘之努力，以二比一力挫大夏，龍頭球藝與實力為眾所週知，可不　言。大夏為一新進之青年球隊，昨日表演之佳，殊可令人滿意。守門沈延冠身手不凡，後衛陳福來邵光銘堅如鐵閘，前衛亦甚堅固，且能造成前鋒之攻勢，尤其正前衛郁黎申及黃曾修之截球與傳球，極為出色，惜鋒綫中之兩翼較軟，中鋒龐美雄亦常遲疑錯失機會為美中不足耳，然無論如何，大夏為一基礎極好之球隊，如能晝量減少盤球，前途希望無窮。</p>
<p>上半時龍頭雖多攻勢，而大夏後衛及守門，均能一一化險為夷，劇戰三刻鐘，未開紀錄，互易陣地後競爭益烈，比賽之進行，亦更見精彩，相持約半小時，龍頭張吉良首開紀錄，但不久即被大夏龐美雄扳成各一平手，龍頭再接再厲，直至終場前三分鐘時，始由姜琨於亂軍中拉射破網，以二比一獲得最後勝利。雙方出場陣容如下：</p>

<p>— 王心景着　陳霖笙校　（四）</p>
<p>乒乓拍的選擇　乒乓拍是拍乒乓的頂要緊的用具，也是唯一的用具。所以乒乓拍的選擇是應該十分注意的。</p>
<p>我們小時候用的乒乓拍，在拍的中部，有着黃荳大小的圓洞，多的有二三十個，少的也有十幾個。排列的形式，是很不一律的。這種拍多半是用杉木做的，質輕而缺乏彈性。現在因為拍中的洞旣沒有意義，又不美觀，已在被淘汰之列。</p>
<p>過去一般人用的乒乓拍，大多是用夾板做成，因夾板是用幾塊薄板，依板的紋路交叉着膠成的，所以很少受氣候的影響。再好一點的乒乓拍是用桐樹或是柳桉做的。質較軟而彈性亦强。有的更用軟木做柄，拍時十分舒適。硬球用乒乓拍，用的一面，上有有刺的橡皮。拍的式樣很不一致，以前最盛行的拍是橢圓形，拍柄作扁平式的；現在比較用熱水袋式圓形柄的居多了。拍的大小，形式，及所用材料，都可各隨自由，乒乓規則上并不限的。</p>
<p>那一種比較便利，須看各人的喜歡，不過依我的意思，拍的質地須輕，彈性須强，過分大是沒有好處的。</p>
<p>霖笙按：本市乒乓競賽，自三十五年度起，一律采用硬球比賽以來，大都改用橡皮板打球了，木板亦久已淘汰，惟一般中小學生打球，因為經濟上的關係，故依舊還有用木板打球的。</p>
<p>（二）我國乒乓球的沿革</p>
<p>一件事業的成功，一定是不斷的發見缺點，逐漸改良，最後才能到比較完善的地步。</p>
<p>乒乓當然不能例外。</p>
<p>乒乓的發明是根據網球原理而成的。當時對於球的大小，輕重，色澤，軟硬……都沒有一定的標準。後來逐漸改良，才有一個標準。然因各人的所好不同，乒乓球又大別為軟球和硬球兩種。十年之前，我國和日本向來是盛行軟球的。因為現在的世界乒乓競賽早已采用的是硬球，近五六年來，我國乒乓界對於提倡硬球，雖亦不遺餘力。可惜傑出的人才太少，要想將來在乒乓的世界舞台上佔一席地，那末對於硬球的技術更非加以特別注意不可。</p>
<p>從前我國所用的乒乓球，完全仰給於外人，那時乒乓運動還不發達，球的銷路有限，損失不大。自民國十二年我國和日本訂約作國際性比賽以後，乒乓運動日見發達，乒乓球的銷路也漸漸加多。同時金錢的流出也一天天的增加。我們對於乒乓的發達，固然表示無限的欣慰。對於金錢的外溢，不得不力謀挽回。</p>
<p>民國十五年，中國乒乓公司為着挽回利權和提倡乒乓運動起見，在努力悉心研製之下，出品了這一種標準的連環牌乒乓球。當然，要提倡乒乓運動，就要自己能製造乒乓用品，否則，提倡乒乓運動，就無異是替外國人推廣銷路，乒乓愈發達，金錢的外流必定愈多，記得中國乒乓研究會裏有一條標語：「拍乒乓，用外國球，有益身體，有損國家。」仔細想想，的確不錯。所以現在中國乒乓公司的成功，對於中國乒乓界有着極大的貢獻。依照乒乓規則的規定，硬球的重量，周圓是：</p>
<p>（甲）重量：二·四〇公分至二·五三公分；</p>
<p>（乙）周圓：三·七九公分（一寸半）。</p>

<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>最近，我去聰了一次公開的演講，很覺得感動。</p>
<p>那位主講的人一開始魷發一個問題：「你們的親戚朋友中，在最近的幾年裏，因爲直接或間接受到戰爭損害而死亡的，請舉手。」的確有人舉手了，可是偌大的一個講堂中，只有十多隻手。</p>
<p>接着，他發出了第二個問題：「你們的親戚朋友中，在最近的數年裏，因爲受到肺癆侵襲而死亡的，請舉手。」這一次，差不多百分之五十以上的手舉了起來。</p>
<p>這一次的講題就是「防癆」，短短的幾十分鐘，可以說聽者動容。我得到最深的印象是一個舉着不少手的塲面，因爲它使我聯想到另外一個同樣的塲面，那是在戰時的德國宣傳片中看到的：無數的法國民衆羣集在一個廣塲中，高呼「希特勒萬歲！」</p>
<p>我雖然很懷疑，可是銀幕上的確這樣顯現着。</p>
<p>終於在無意中看雜誌，我得到了答案。那是在德軍攻佔了一個法國大城以後，他們就召集了當地民衆，一個軍官在麥克風中發問：「請不懂德語的人舉起手來。」</p>
<p>全部的手舉了起來，區影機一一攝入鏡頭。同樣是一個偉大的舉手塲面，却也有這些分別，世界上的事，可見得眞難以判別呀！</p>
<h3 id="c103">異地殊俗 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>

<p>巴黎有一些房東，在租契土訂明，允許每一個房客每月可舉行一次大吵大鬧的宴會。在這一次宴會中，無論什麼遊戲，甚至拳擊。都可以舉行，到第二天早晨八點鐘爲止。別的房客對此不得干涉。不過在舉行集會以前一一天該房客應具書面通知房東，讓房東可以有充分的時間來警吿其他房客，於該晚作暫時遷出或其他的舉備。</p>
<p>在瑞典，主婦們舉行盛宴時，往往把安排好的席次製成一張表格，貼在入門處，俾使那些記憶較差的賓客，雖在介紹後遺忘了其他客人的姓名，而仍能「按圖索驥」，毫不失禮地酬酢其間。</p>

<p>我國人慣說「力大如牛」，法國人愛說「力大如驢」，英美人則喜歡說「力大如熊」。事實上，熊的氣力確比牛，驢都大到十幾倍。據說，熊若舉掌一擊，牛驢的頭顱可被擊成稀爛。</p>
<p>北美洲的阿拉斯加，阿利松拉，和佛羅利達等處森林中，是熊的活躍地帶，它們的毛色多半是黑的，有少數則是肉桂色，咖啡色，或淺棕色，不管是什麼顏色，北美居民一律稱之爲」黑熊」。</p>
<p>黑熊的體重可達四百磅，高三呎；牠能像人一樣的筆直站起，這時，牠的身高是六呎。在短距離內，牠每小時可行三十哩。說起他的氣力，獸類中除了象外，可說無有敵手，牠能拉動三百磅重齣木頭，拔起二十呎高的橡樹，有一次，佛羅利達有一黑熊，用前足抓起一隻一百五十磅重的猪，蹤行了近一哩路，及至農人成羣追來，方才捨棄了獵獲物。</p>
<p>黑熊什麼都吃：水菓，樹根，昆虫，魚類，以及牠所能提到的任何動物。尤喜吃齣，是蜂蜜和螞蟻，電話綫常遭到牠的破壞，因爲牠誤以爲電話綫的「嗡嗡「聲是蜜蜂發出來的，所以常攀爬上電綫杆，抓下電綫。說起黑熊的爬樹本領，那是牠自幼訓練出來的特技。一隻離開娘胎還不到三月的幼熊，魷喜歡爬上不高的小樹，直到樹枝受重垂下時，方才跳下地來。黑熊捕食螞蟻的法子也頗聰明，牠掘出蟻巢，將前足伸出，讓發怒的螞蟻爬滿一足後，就立刻舐食個精光。</p>
<p>每年十一月至次年四月，是黑熊的「冬眠」期。在這時侯，牠們蟄伏在石穴或大樹洞中，不食不動，心臟跳動和呼吸速度，都變得特別緩慢。雌熊就在這段時期中生產，每胎可產熊嬰二三隻，每隻體重不到一磅，瞎眼無毛，冬眠一月後，才能出洞玩要。「冬眠」期是黑熊的休息期，但也是牠的厄運期，因爲獵人們常利用道時候去捕捉，牠們只好俯首魷擒。</p>
<p>美國國家公園中，蓄養着好多隻黑熊，牠們都很馴服。據說，牠們最愛拍照，當遊客舉起照相機時，牠們便會擺出最優美，最威武的姿勢，讓遊客攝進鏡頭。</p>

<p>— 范瘦梧</p>
<p>値此亂離之世，最容易引起人對歷史陳蹟的思念。初春寒夜，一燈熒熒，於是偶然想起了明末抗戰英雄黃淳耀及其所寫以「野人」爲題的三首詩來。</p>
<p>淳耀，字蘊生，明嘉定人，崇禎癸未進士（癸未即崇禎十六年，是年李自成攻陷北京，帝自經），其時流寇披猖，朝中政治腐化，天下飢荒，民怨沸騰。淳耀目擊心傷，辭歸故里，編練民團，號召鄉梓民衆，作保國保鄉的準備。無奈大勢已去，隻手難扶大廈之傾，於是，他只得以哀時感事的胸懷，寄諸於詩歌。傳誦千秋的「野人」詩，就是這種情緒下的產物。詩云：</p>
<p>野人歎息王師勞，秦賊楚賊如蝟毛，攻城掠野官吏死，大江以北民嗷嗷。昨聞死賊刦財賦，分與官軍作賄賂，亂斫民頭掛高樹，黎明視賊賊已去。</p>
<p>野人嘆息年歲惡，池中掘井井底涸，飛蝗引子來蔽天，枉自傾家事田作。朝庭加派時時有，哭訴官司但搖手，歸逢吏胥狹路邊，軟裘快馬行索錢。</p>
<p>野人歎息朝無人，朝中明黨如魚鱗，十官召對九官默，匍匐苟且容一身。廟堂何人理陰陽，頻年日食四海荒，吾欲上書問朝士，却恐人訶妄男子。</p>
<p>原詩見「明詩別裁」選集，沈德潛在詩後按云：「朝野大勢如是，雖欲不亡，其可得乎」？歷史是一】面無情的鏡子，詩中的話在三百年後的今日，仍値得我們警惕。</p>

<h3 id="c107">談吃人 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>在太古時代，照例是要人吃人的。春秋左氏傳上還提到「食肉寢皮」的話，或許是左邱明的浮誇吧？不過歷史上記載吃人的事，的確頗多。麻叔謀吃人，連小孩子也會知道。一班忠臣孝子，親手殺掉仇人之後，照例是要生食其肉。大家不但不說他們野蠻，更稱讀他們的忠孝呢？據說，現在還有些野蠻民族，吃掉他們的爺娘，總算盡孝。總之，不管吃掉仇人，或是吃掉爺娘，吃人總是盡孝之一怯，無怪魯迅要說整個的歷史，只是「吃人」兩個大字，但是這位提倡憎恨的文學家，只知道吃人是惡意，我却知道吃人也有存着善意的。吃人是可惡，有時却也可嘉。</p>
<p>吃人的方式多矣，最妙不過的，是「鷄助編」上有這樣一段的記載：</p>
<p>「唐初賊朱粲以人爲糧，謂啖醉人如食糟豚。……而自（）宋）靖康丙午歲，金狄亂華，，……盜賊官兵以至居民，更互相食人，肉之價賤於犬豕……老瘦男子謂之「燒把火」，婦人少艾者名爲「不羨羊」，小兒呼爲「和骨爛」，又通目爲「兩腳羊」。……」</p>
<p>以上云云，大家且不要說他們殘酷，他們是根據經傳的。左傳上不是說過的麼？「譬如禽獸，臣食其肉而寢處其皮矣！」他們吃的不是人，原來是禽獸啊！</p>
<p>人肉我沒有吃過，因爲我不是忠臣孝子，又不是野蠻人。但是有一個退伍軍官曾吿訴我說，他是吃過人的心肝的。據說，味通跟豬肝差不多；最初他不知道吃的是人肉，所以津津有味，事後知道，他却吐了，人家還駡他膽子太小，人肉不配他吃。我遇到他的當兒，正是他潦倒不堪的時侯，他之所以一世不得意，或許是爲了吃不慣人肉吧？</p>
<p>自古以來，孝順子女，刲股以療親疾，這是吃人肉方式的演變，也算得國粹。</p>
<p>吃人！吃人！花樣繁多，動機不一，有的人吃人，有的人甘心被人吃。「韓非子」上的俠士互以自己的肉請客，更算得豪舉</p>
<p>他日有暇，更當以「吃人」爲題，做一驚洋洋數萬言的者據文字，現在魷此帶住吧。</p>

It seems that there are no insurmountable problems. We will carefully adhere to the government's wishes and conduct negotiations with the CCP with the greatest sincerity, hoping to reach an agreement so that true and lasting peace can be realized at an early date, to comfort the ardent hopes of compatriots across the country. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life who love peace will give us guidance, supervision, and support at any time."</p>
<h3 id="e3">College Students in the Capital March and Petition; Clash with Military Officers Corps; No Fewer Than 160 People Injured on Both Sides, Five Critically Injured; Government Authorities Strictly Prevent Escalation of the Situation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 1st] Thousands of students from eleven colleges in the capital held a large-scale march and demonstration movement today, amidst the start of peace talks by the peace delegation leaving Beijing for Beiping, resulting in a clash with military officers and causing mutual beatings. No fewer than 160 people were injured on both sides, and five were seriously injured and in critical condition. The situation is serious, and the Capital Garrison Headquarters has taken emergency measures to prevent escalation. From 10:00 PM tonight, a special curfew will be imposed early, and orders have been issued that from the 2nd, if any officers corps members take the initiative to go to any school and have any conflict with students, they will be shot on the spot. President of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin, in addition to expressing unlimited regret for this unfortunate incident, will investigate and hold those responsible accountable. It is reported that the security authorities had received reports in advance about the students' desire to hold a demonstration and march, so they tried to persuade them, but to no avail. By 10:00 AM on the 1st, 3,000 students from eleven colleges had gathered at Zhongda University, and then went to the Presidential Palace to petition, sending ten representatives to request an audience with Acting President Li, presenting several requests, including demanding full public funding, implementing the seven promises, striving for true peace, and opposing false peace. Secretary-General Weng Wenhao met with them on behalf of the President, expressing sympathy for the students' demands, promising to convey them, and saying that he would find ways to improve the treatment of all staff and workers. The students then left the Presidential Palace and marched through the city, using several trucks as propaganda vehicles, shouting slogans such as "Oppose hunger, oppose persecution," "Oppose American aid," "Oppose the issuance of large bills," "Oppose conscription," and "Oppose false peace," and performing Yangko dances to promote their cause to the public. They returned to Zhongda University to disband at 2:20 PM, and students from each school returned to their schools in separate groups. When the students were marching, near Dazhong Bridge, because the slogans they shouted were too stimulating, and they posted slogans to promote their cause to the military officers, a dispute occurred with several members of the military officers corps stationed nearby (all of whom were officers who had retreated from the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign). The military officers tore down the slogans posted by the students, and after the students disbanded, about 100 students from the Drama School returned to their school in a group, arriving at Dazhong Bridge, and a conflict and mutual beating occurred with about 300 military officers and soldiers. More than 60 students were arrested, and more than 10 were injured. Some students fled to NCCU for help, and hundreds of NCCU students gathered and went to rescue them, and they encountered the military officers corps again, and more than 10 people were injured again, including two seriously injured (one named Ding Yongping, and one a female student named Tian Wenhui). Zhongda University students were reported to have organized a team to go to the Presidential Palace to petition (it was already 6:00 PM), demanding punishment of the perpetrators and compensation for medical expenses. The military officers corps near Dazhong Bridge also heard the news and immediately forcibly occupied several trucks used by the Drama School for their parade, driving to the Presidential Palace, and a conflict occurred again with Zhongda University students. The security authorities, to prevent further incidents, imposed a curfew early at 10:00 PM, and the students were unable to move, so the number of casualties has not yet been ascertained, but it is known that most of the injured have been sent to the hospital, and it is rumored that 10 students are still missing. The students participating in the march today included 11 schools, including NCCU, Zhongda University, Jinling University, Ginling Women's University, the Drama School, Jianguo, the Law and Business School, and the Oriental Language School. Approximately 5,000 students.</p>
<p>Among the students injured in the conflict, those admitted to Gulou Hospital include 29 from NCCU, 21 from Zhongda University, 16 from Jianguo, and 1 from the Joint Logistics Headquarters. Five students, including Ding Yongping, Wu Deyi, Fang Bingxiang, Zuo Shijie, and Cheng Luze, were seriously injured and in critical condition. The number of deaths on both sides is still under investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Garrison Headquarters Spokesperson Talks About the Course of the Conflict <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 1st] Luo Chunbo, Director of the Political Work Department and spokesperson for the Capital Garrison Headquarters, received more than 30 Chinese and foreign reporters at the Headquarters at 9:00 PM on the 1st. First, Bao Jing'an, spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, reported that President He expressed great regret and attached great importance to the conflict between college students in the capital and the officers and soldiers of the Third Battalion of the military officers corps and had ordered the relevant authorities to investigate the responsibility and deal with it fairly. Director Luo then reported the course of the conflict in detail as follows: (1) Luo first said that the Garrison Headquarters received intelligence about the students' march yesterday afternoon and had advised all 11 colleges and universities in the capital not to hold it. After requesting instructions from the Presidential Palace and the Executive Yuan, instructions were received to persuade them, and if they did not listen, to allow them to march, but to protect them along the way and pay attention to maintaining order; (2) After receiving the instructions, the Headquarters ordered the police to step up their efforts to maintain public order. From 9:00 AM this morning, college students from various schools gathered at Sipailou, gradually increasing to 4,000 to 5,000 people. At 11:00 AM, led by the Drama School, the team set off, first to the Presidential Palace to petition, then along Guofu Road, along the main roads, to Baixia Road, distributing leaflets, posting slogans, shouting slogans, and the propaganda teams formed by various schools carried out individual propaganda to the crowds on the roadside, but until the parade disbanded at 2:00 PM, the order was orderly, and no accidents occurred; (3) Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM, the Garrison Headquarters suddenly received a report from the South District Police Department that some students who had marched had gone to Daguang Road and Dazhong Bridge after disbanding, intending to carry out propaganda to the officers and soldiers of the Third Battalion of the military officers corps (according to the report, all the officers and soldiers of the battalion were officers and soldiers who had been captured by the Communist army during the war and later returned). The team refused to accept them, and the students posted slogans all over the team's gate and distributed leaflets at the same time. The members of the military officers corps then tore up the leaflets and slogans, so they went from verbal arguments to fighting. After the Garrison Headquarters received the report from the South District Police Department, it sent personnel to suppress and mediate, and sent dozens of injured people from both sides to the hospital for treatment, and the situation had calmed down. Unexpectedly, after the fighting occurred, some students went back to their schools to ask for help, and the number of people who reassembled reached more than 2,000. The military officers corps also increased their support in order not to show weakness, so retaliation began again, and the situation became more intense. The Headquarters then sent personnel to mediate again. At this time, after the conflict expanded, the students advocated going to the Presidential Palace to petition, and the military officers corps immediately followed, resulting in fighting again on Guofu Road. The situation was chaotic at the time, and officers of the Garrison Headquarters were also injured while suppressing the situation. At this point, the Commander-in-Chief had no choice but to order the special task force to participate in the suppression and strictly ordered the members of the military officers corps that if they did not listen again, they would be killed on the spot regardless. The Garrison Headquarters arrested a total of eight members of the military officers corps at that time. At 8:00 PM, the members of the military officers corps were gathered and returned to their teams, and the injured were sent to the hospital. The situation calmed down at this point; (4) According to the Garrison Headquarters' statistics, the first time there were six students seriously injured and 66 lightly injured, a total of 72 people, at the Daguang New Village headquarters of the military officers corps on Daguang Road. The second time there were five seriously injured and 24 lightly injured, a total of 29 people. On the military officers corps side, there were 48 lightly injured in the first time, and five seriously injured and in the second time. In total, there were 11 students seriously injured, 101 lightly injured, a total of 112 people, and 40 members of the military officers corps. The total number of people on both sides was 160; (5) After the incident, the Garrison Headquarters has sent the injured to Gulou Central Hospital. After bandaging and changing the medicine for those with minor injuries, they were escorted back to their schools. Therefore, from beginning to end, except for the seven members of the military officers corps who are still detained at the Headquarters (another suspect, Gesang Quepei (Tibetan)), the Garrison Headquarters has never arrested any students; (6) In short, the conflict between the students and the officers corps was a purely accidental event. The military officers corps did not know in advance that the students wanted to carry out propaganda, and the students did not notify the team in advance that they wanted to carry out propaganda, which led to the conflict due to differences in the way both sides viewed things and temporary emotional agitation. The Department will conduct a thorough investigation of this case in many aspects and request the higher authorities to handle it. At the end of Director Luo's report, the seven members of the military officers corps detained by the Department, including Zhang Chengfang and Li Peigen, also reported the course of the conflict in great detail.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] According to a national army officer who escaped from a Communist army POW camp on the 1st, General Du Yuming has died of a hunger strike. The officer asked the reporter not to disclose his name. He said: After General Du Yuming was captured, he tried to commit suicide by knocking his head against a stone, but failed. Later, the Communist army escorted General Du to Xuzhou and paraded him through the streets. After that, Du refused to eat a single grain of rice in the Communist army prisoner-of-war camp and died of a hunger strike. General Wang Yaowu, the former chairman of Shandong Province, has been detained in a prisoner-of-war camp eighty miles east of Jinan. In addition, there are seven other national army general-level officers who are also imprisoned in the prisoner-of-war camp. The seven general-level officers have to do hard labor for half a day every day in the camp, sawing wood and grinding rice or wheat, and the rest of the time they read communist books.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Smiling Faces, Heavy Hearts: Scenes of the Peace Delegation Leaving Nanjing; Many Relatives and Friends Entrust Them to Carry US Dollars and Silver Dollars <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The peace delegation finally left on this day of Western proverbs' lies (April 1st), not lying. In addition to officials, the most people who came to the airport to see them off were people's representatives and members of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>The earliest and most eye-catching of the delegation members was the veteran peace elder Shao Lizi. Wherever he went, people surrounded him, with laughter and crowding. Elder Yu Youren walked back and forth to find him. Mrs. Shao wanted him not to walk, but he said, "What does it matter? Let them take a walk," and everyone burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Newspaper reporters surrounded Elder Shao, and he tried to keep walking non-stop. When asked to sit down, he refused. So this encirclement became a guerrilla team, swimming back and forth. Some people said, "This is the younger generation surrounding the older generation," because Elder Shao is a veteran reporter.</p>
<p>The list of people leaving with the delegation was always kept secret, and newspaper reporters were unable to interview them everywhere, so they had to seek it from the list of people weighing in. As a result, they predicted the future, only using numbers instead, so reporters had to guess based on weight, such as 54 kilograms, which might be Zhang Shizhao, 65 kilograms, which might be Zhang Zhizhong, etc.</p>
<p>As soon as Zhang Qun arrived at the airport, he asked Zhang Zhizhong, "Where is Mr. Shao? Where is Mr. Shao?" When they found him, the two Zhangs and one Shao said in succession, "We have private words, we have private words," escaping the reporters' encirclement to open a "three-person meeting."</p>
<p>Elder Shao is a man with a smiling face and a heavy heart. After talking with Zhang Qun for a while today, when shaking hands to say goodbye, Elder Shao said, "I won't be too pessimistic, don't worry." Zhang Qun said two more words, "Military," and Elder Shao nodded again to indicate that he "knew." This heaviness lasted until Zhang Qun lowered his head after the plane took off.</p>
<p>Many relatives and friends asked the delegation to carry US dollars and silver dollars. Legislative Yuan member Wu Zhaoxu temporarily wrapped ten silver dollars in a small piece of torn newspaper and handed them to Li Junlong to give to Mrs. Wu. Li Lishi said, "Truly a standard husband."</p>
<p>It is said that Mrs. Zhang Zhizhong treats her husband with ancient etiquette and is rarely seen in public. Today, she also carried a glass handbag to the airport to see him off, which attracted much attention.</p>
<p>Before Elder Shao boarded the plane, he shook hands with his wife to say goodbye. Because of the crowded people, they were separated, and Elder Shao shouted loudly, "Goodbye!" His wife said, "I can't even hold your hand," as if she couldn't help but feel sad.</p>
<p>When the door of the special plane was already closed, He Yingqin still stood there with a focused expression. Someone asked He what he thought, and he said, "I hope they succeed!" The plane finally took off, and the huge roar and wind caused by the engines also passed, leaving behind a piece of calm.</p>

<p>[Our Hankou Office, 1st] The flames of war have approached Xinyang, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. This morning at around 8:00 AM, residents of Beiguan heard a rumbling of artillery fire, which lasted for about a quarter of an hour. Zhu Qiping, deputy commander of the Fifth Pacification District, who was ordered to return to Xinyang from Hankou to direct the battle, arrived in Xinyang this afternoon. Merchants and civilians inside and outside the city are fleeing south one after another. The Railway Bureau has added a passenger train to evacuate people, and the tragic scene of fleeing during the Spring Festival has reappeared at the station, from Datong Road to inside the city. At 10:00 PM on the 1st, telecommunications between Hankou and Xinyang were interrupted. It is reported that this is due to obstacles on the Beijing-Hankou line north of Huayuan. Also, Lin Biao's troops continued to move three divisions to the southwest of Wuyang yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 1st] Military news: At 2:20 PM this afternoon, hundreds of unidentified Communist troops were found near Yanghe, about ten li northeast of Xinyang, attacking the urban area.

<h3 id="e11">The Peace Talks Have Begun <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The government's peace negotiation delegation, a group of six led by "Peace General" Zhang Zhizhong, flew from Nanjing to Beiping yesterday morning amidst the bright spring sunshine to begin negotiations with the CCP delegation. The progress of these peace talks is not only about reconciliation and mending fences between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party but also concerns the entire nation's destiny and the people's livelihood. Especially for the people throughout the country who have suffered from war, it is like a ray of light in the darkness. Whether the people nationwide can escape from the abyss of suffering and realize a happy and joyful life will depend on the outcome of these peace talks. Therefore, all the people in the country, whether in the north or south, male or female, old or young, watched the government's peace delegation fly north yesterday with urgent anticipation, and earnestly wished the delegation success on their mission, with "only success allowed, no failure permitted." Standing on the people's side, as these peace talks are just beginning, we would like to offer a few points for the reference of the Kuomintang and Communist Party peace talk representatives.</p>
<p>First, the peace talk representatives of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must stand on the side of the people. Although we are not excessively superstitious about theories such as "sovereignty rests with the people" or the "people's century," we believe that the power of the people is great, and the trend of public opinion cannot be defied. Any government that is detached from the people, no matter how strong its military force may be, will eventually collapse. Any political party, no matter how great its momentum, if it does not have the people as its foundation and blindly believes in military force, will inevitably fail in the end if it carries the war through to the end. Such historical lessons are countless and cannot be enumerated. This must be known to the peace talk representatives of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. It is remembered that when the Kuomintang launched the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China, they called their army the National Revolutionary Army. Today, the CCP also calls its army the "People's Liberation Army." Although there is a difference between "national" and "people" in the wording, their meaning is the same. When translated into English, both are "People." Therefore, today, when the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are conducting peace talks, they must stand on the side of the people. Otherwise, the peace talks will lose their meaning.</p>
<p>Second, only by conducting peace talks under the principle of "the people's interests above all else" can the peace talks have a bright future. The joys and sorrows, separations and reunions, between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have a history of thirty years. The new and old grievances between them are innumerable. If today's peace talks still do not forget revenge and insist that blood debts must be repaid with blood, then we can assert that the peace talks have no future at all. Conversely, if the representatives of both sides can abandon their petty prejudices and focus on the bigger picture, taking the interests of the people and the happiness of the country as a prerequisite, then there is absolutely no hatred in the world that cannot be resolved. In particular, in the political struggles between political parties, success should not be taken as glory, and failure need not be considered a great shame. The outdated notion of "become king if successful, become a bandit if defeated" must not be allowed to remain in today's era of party politics. We would like to remind the peace talk representatives of both sides that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party often tout themselves as "serving the country and the people." The people have already heard enough. Who is genuine and who is fake? These peace talks are an excellent touchstone. Today, the people throughout the country are suffering from the torment of war and can no longer survive. The nation and the people have reached the beginning of survival and extinction. The severity of the situation is greater than when the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cooperated in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. If the two sides still cannot embrace and cry together, resolve their grievances and make peace, unite as one, and build an independent, prosperous, healthy, and free new China, what are they talking about "serving the country and the people"! Whichever side it is, it will be abandoned by the people.</p>
<p>Third, we must further point out, what is the people's position? What are the people's interests? Frankly speaking, whether it is the common people in the government-controlled area or the people in the Communist-controlled area, their positions are consistent, and their interests are the same. In other words, their position is peace, and their benefit is peace. Peace is supreme, peace is first, peace is above all else. We hope that the government representatives will tell the CCP representatives in detail about the situation of the people in Jiangnan living in dire straits and their urgent desire for peace, so that they can realize that making peace at this time can best win the hearts of the people. However, if they disregard the life and death of the people and act willfully, they will be abandoned by the people. On the other hand, the government representatives should also take the opportunity during the peace talks to investigate the lives and feelings of the people in the CCP-controlled area, so that although the people throughout the country are geographically divided into government-controlled areas and CCP-controlled areas, they are still a whole in terms of emotion and cannot be separated. Let this public opinion have supreme authority, so that neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party can stubbornly adhere to its own party's or individual's private interests, and will have to obey the will of the people and achieve the task of peace talks.</p>
<p>When the government representatives left Nanjing, they issued a written statement, expressing their feeling of being in a deep abyss and walking on thin ice, deeply feeling that these peace talks are related to the nation's destiny and the people's livelihood. They also pointed out that if both sides can conduct peace talks in a spirit of mutual trust, mutual understanding, and mutual concession, there are no insurmountable difficulties. This attitude of being neither humble nor arrogant and being pragmatic is indeed worthy of our admiration and will be unanimously supported by the people throughout the country. At the same time, we only hope that the CCP representatives will also embrace this spirit of "just ask for cultivation, don't ask for harvest," sit down calmly and calmly, and conduct peace talks with the government representatives. If the two sides can treat each other with sincerity and forbear each other for the sake of peace, then the future of the peace talks is bright. Even if there are twists and turns in the process of the peace talks, as long as the people throughout the country can exert the power of being the masters of their own affairs at any time, supervise from the sidelines, and only allow success and not allow failure, the future result will surely enable the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resolve their grievances and make peace, and will surely enable the whole country to turn hostility into peace and harmony, dispel the smoke of war in the Chinese sky, and radiate the sunshine of peace!</p>
<h3 id="e12">Investigation of Smuggling of Cash Currency - Concealment of Amount Shared - Qingdao Garrison Headquarters Internal Personnel - Law Enforcement Violating the Law in Corruption - Liu Anqi Furious, All Colleagues in the Garrison Headquarters Deeply Indignant - Chief of Staff Dismissed, Chief Inspector Etc. Have Been Detained <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch on the 1st] A corruption case has occurred at the Qingdao Garrison Headquarters, where law enforcement violated the law, involving quite a few people, including Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters Huang Gonglu. Upon learning of this, Sui District Commander and Garrison Commander Liu Anqi was greatly angered and first dismissed Huang from his post and transferred him to a high-level staff position in the Sui District, with the vacancy filled by He Jihou, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Sui District. Zhang Tong, Chief Inspector of the Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters, and Yu Jingchen, Station Chief of the Xiaogang Inspection Station, were detained and handed over to the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters for strict investigation and reporting for handling. This case has not only been widely circulated and discussed in various circles, but also all colleagues in the Sui District Garrison Headquarters are deeply indignant at this behavior that destroys discipline.</p>
<p>The Course of Events - The Investigation Has Clues</p>
<p>Since receiving the case on the 22nd of last month, the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters has been conducting continuous interrogations in the spirit of military law. According to Military Law Officer Dang Zhixian, he has not been able to sleep peacefully for five days and nights. However, during the investigation, it was not convenient to make any announcements internally or externally. There are now concrete clues, and the criminal suspicion is extremely serious. It may be necessary to form a joint trial court, and after the verdict, it will be submitted for approval. The course of events of the case is as follows: On the 13th of last month, the Xiaogang Inspection Station of the Garrison Headquarters discovered that a certain merchant was smuggling 38 million Gold Yuan Certificates from a certain place, packed in several sacks. According to the Measures for Restricting the Entry of Cash Currency implemented by the Sui District on February 22, only 100,000 yuan were allowed to be carried per person. Once the excess amount was discovered, it would be handed over to the Central Bank for freezing, and a daily limit of 10,000 yuan would be withdrawn each day (it seems that there has been no change recently due to changes in currency values). If the relationship of smuggling is investigated in depth, there will naturally be other discoveries. However, after the huge sum of money was discovered, the station chief of the inspection station, Yu Jingchen, and the chief inspector, Zhang Tong, etc., arbitrarily returned 20 million yuan, detained 18 million yuan, and reported it to the Garrison Headquarters for handling. When the Chief of Staff signed the document, he falsely reported it as 1.8 million yuan, deleting a zero, and putting 16.2 million yuan into their own pockets. After this incident occurred, rumors spread on the road. After someone secretly reported it to Commander Liu Anqi, it was finally exposed. When Zhang Tong was detained, 25 taels of gold and 150 US dollars were found in his residence. It is reported that Zhang Tong, etc., have confessed the situation in the Military Law Office in detail, and it involves quite a few people. Another news said: Huang Gonglu only has the suspicion of dereliction of duty, etc. At present, the trend is that Zhang Tong seems to be mainly responsible, but people believe that this lieutenant colonel chief inspector does not have the courage to take sole responsibility. According to Chief of Staff He Jihou, the environment in Qingdao is complicated, and the work of the Garrison Headquarters is extremely important. He has no comment on the case of the previous Chief of Staff, but it will be handled according to law. Military Law Officer Dang Zhixian has already summoned several related persons, but the owner of the money has not yet been summoned.</p>
<p>The Opium Trafficking Case Is Also Under Investigation</p>
<p>Another news said: On the 13th of last month, Song Shaojin, Liu Pinsan, Yu Xihou, etc., who were from Haiyang City at No. 69 Cixiang Road in this city, were secretly reported to have established a firm and smuggled and trafficked opium from the Communist area. That night, the military police宪 conducted a search, and Zhang Tong was also one of the searchers. It is reported that suspicious bills and other suspicious objects were found. They are still detained at the Garrison Headquarters, and the whole case has not yet been announced. It is reported that this case is also within the scope of the investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e13">The Fuel Shortage in Qingdao Is Serious - The Consumption of the Garrison Troops Is Astonishing - Worth 1,000 Taels of Gold Per Month - The Trees in the Suburbs Have Been Almost Cut Down, Gradually Extending into the Urban Area <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch on the 31st] Military information: The Qingdao garrison troops regularly maintain tens of thousands of people. The fuel shortage is becoming increasingly serious. The trees in the suburbs have been almost completely cut down. Recently, the phenomenon of armed tree cutting has gradually extended into the urban area. It is estimated that if calculated in terms of coal, it would cost 1,000 taels of gold per month to ensure an adequate supply. At present, the source of coal is difficult, and the famous Qingdao is feeling the threat of becoming a barren mountain. In addition to borrowing 1,200 tons of coal from China Textile and the power plant to meet urgent needs, Mayor Qin Decun also summoned representatives from the power plant, China Textile, and the shipping industry on the 31st to discuss the issue of exchanging materials for coal between Qingdao and Tianjin. This suggestion was originally telegraphed by the three parties to the Tianjin Industrial Association and received a reply expressing agreement in principle. At yesterday's meeting of the municipal government, it was decided to send two representatives to Tianjin and to establish a special agency to handle the matter, but no specific decisions were made on the selection of representatives and the organizational methods of the agency. Another meeting will be convened tomorrow, and the ratio issue will be discussed in detail so that the two representatives can discuss it with Tianjin merchants.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch on the 1st] Xu Yiguan, director of the Qingdao Power Plant, returned to Qingdao after completing negotiations on purchasing Taiwanese coal in Shanghai. According to him, he has reached an agreement with the United Office of the Four Mines in Taiwan to purchase 10,000 tons of coal per month in cash. The first batch is expected to arrive in Qingdao on the 6th of this month.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 1st] The land reform plan for the Seventh Administrative District of Western Fujian has been approved by the Provincial Government and has been granted a first-phase subsidy of US$8,000 by the China Rural Reconstruction Commission, which has been signed and paid in Xiamen.

(5) Intelligence personnel who expose their identities and have unclear intentions will be arrested.</p>

However, the issuance of bonds was originally intended to have the rich contribute money so that the province's industrial and mining industries would not collapse, rural side occupations would gradually develop, and people's livelihoods would gradually stabilize. It is not a good way to save the social crisis by our own efforts. The students have failed to understand this intention and do not agree with it. The provincial government has decided to adopt the students' opinions and stop the issuance. He also said: As long as it is good for Gansu Province, the provincial government has no prejudices. Guo added at the end: If there is any fault in the political measures, it is my sole fault. If I am to bear any responsibility, I am personally willing to bear it.

<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 1st] Yin Liyan in Wugang, calling himself the "Southwest Commander-in-Chief of the People's Revolutionary Army," has been calling for war and recently sent underground personnel to Changsha to distribute various absurd propaganda materials. The names on the documents were "Meng Gong, President of the New China Party, and Yin Chongyi, Vice President and Commander-in-Chief of the New China Revolutionary Army" (Note: Yin Chongyi is Yin Liyan, and it is not known who the President Meng Gong is).

<p>[This City News] According to an announcement by the ECA, approximately 187,000 bales of raw cotton from the ECA are scheduled to be shipped to China within April, May, and June. This raw cotton includes the 5,000 bales currently being unloaded in Shanghai, the 87,000 bales already en route or about to be shipped from the United States to China, and the 95,000 bales recently approved for purchase by the ECA headquarters in Washington.</p>
<p>[This City News] From a legal point of view, the ECA ended at midnight yesterday. However, the Chinese and foreign staff of the ECA cannot be dismissed immediately before receiving notice. Therefore, all work will continue as usual. Salaries for the next two weeks have been prepared in advance, but if the parliament cannot allocate funds by April 20, the staff will inevitably have to "work on an empty stomach." According to senior officials, if the financial difficulties are such that the funds cannot be allocated, they will also use legal procedures to use the stored rice and flour for funding. As far as the promotion of aid-to-China plans is concerned, even if the parliament delays passing the bill, there will be no impact, as the appropriations for food and oil have been approved for use until June, and the same is true for raw cotton. Of the total economic aid of 275 million yuan, there is still 54 million yuan left. The American parliament is now planning to extend the life of the ECA until the end of this year or February next year, but the use of funds is limited to this. It is not yet known whether this proposal will be successfully passed, but it can be said with certainty that even if the bill is not passed, the ECA has sufficient funds to handle the closing work in an orderly manner.</p>

<h3 id="e30">The Soviet Union Sends Separate Notes to Seven Western Nations Protesting the North Atlantic Treaty, Denouncing it as a Violation of International Agreements and Manifestly Aggressive; The U.S., Britain, and France Believe the Soviet Accusations are Utterly Groundless <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Moscow, 1st] Yesterday, the Soviet Union sent memoranda to the governments of the seven nations that initiated the North Atlantic Treaty—Britain, the United States, France, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg—denouncing the treaty as open aggression against the Soviet Union and a violation of five international agreements. All Moscow morning newspapers published the full text of the memorandum on their front pages, but without commentary. The memorandum concludes with the following three points: (1) The North Atlantic Treaty is openly aggressive in nature and is directed against the Soviet Union. (2) It violates the United Nations Charter. (3) It undermines the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet treaties of friendship and non-aggression, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Agreement. The Soviet Union does not accept the treaty's claim that it is strictly defensive and complies with UN principles, stating that official representatives of the U.S., Britain, and France have clearly indicated that the treaty is aimed at the Soviet Union and other communist countries in Eastern Europe. The participating countries are all engaged in military preparations, such as stockpiling atomic bombs, which are not defensive in nature. The participating countries have maintained the Anglo-American Combined Chiefs of Staff from the last war in Washington, established the Western European Union defense organization in Fontainebleau outside Paris, and now plan to establish a defense committee under the new treaty. All of this only increases anxiety and panic, and stirs up war hysteria. The real purpose of the treaty is to intimidate countries that are unwilling to obey the orders of the Anglo-American bloc.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 1st (Broadcast): A spokesman for the U.S. State Department has flatly denied the Soviet claim that the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty is to attack the Soviet Union. The spokesman said that the Soviet propaganda is intended solely to create confusion. However, U.S. officials do not feel surprised by the Soviet accusations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] Following the Soviet Union's protest to the signatory nations of the North Atlantic Treaty, the immediate reaction here is that this move represents no significant progress over the Soviet government's foreign policy statement of January 29. The Soviet protest merely condemns the Atlantic Treaty without demanding any action, indicating that Moscow intends to use this protest as a propaganda ploy, rather than a genuine diplomatic protest.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 1st] A British Foreign Office spokesman, regarding the Soviet Union's note protesting the North Atlantic Treaty, said that it is regrettable that the Soviet Union is repeating Stalin and Lenin's assertion that the world must be divided into two parts. He continued that the British government will formally respond to the Soviet note in due course. The reply will likely point out, as Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons last month, that the Atlantic Treaty contains no secret clauses and that any country without aggressive aims or intentions need not fear this treaty. The Soviet Union today appears to have laid the foundation for completely severing relations with the West in order to oppose the Atlantic Treaty. This could include the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the United Nations, should the Soviet Union choose this drastic measure.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 1st] A French Foreign Office spokesman stated on the 1st that the Soviet note accusing the Atlantic Treaty of being an anti-Soviet alliance is "completely unfounded." Referring to the Franco-Soviet Agreement of 1944, the spokesman emphasized that the agreement does not conflict with the Atlantic Treaty.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Following British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Acheson and Schuman Confer, Exchanging Views on Issues Such as West Germany <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 1st (Broadcast): French Foreign Minister Schuman, after a one-and-a-half-hour discussion with Acheson, stated, "We exchanged views on several key issues, including the German question. Although the time was short and we were unable to discuss them in detail, we at least gained an outline. I hope that all issues can achieve good results during my stay in the United States." Schuman said, "It is not yet known when discussions on the issue of Italian colonies will begin, but since this matter has already been placed on the UN General Assembly's agenda, there is no need for me to raise it again."</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 31st] Secretary of State Acheson held a secret two-hour meeting with British Foreign Secretary Bevin today. A brief statement was issued after the meeting, stating that the Secretary of State and Mr. Bevin discussed several European issues of mutual concern, particularly a comprehensive review of the West German issue, and exchanged views on the situation in Greece, but no decisions were made. It is reported that the two believe that the West German issue can be resolved at the upcoming meeting of the foreign ministers of the U.S., Britain, and France next week.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The foreign ministers of Portugal, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland arrived here last night. The State Department announced today that the foreign ministers of twelve countries will participate in the signing of the Atlantic Treaty on April 4. The twelve countries are Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and the United States. Portuguese Foreign Minister Mateus stated that Portugal will take into account the interests of the Iberian Bloc in every step of implementing the Atlantic Treaty. (Portugal and Spain concluded the Iberian Bloc agreement in 1943, stipulating that the two countries should consult with each other on major events.) The foreign ministers of France and the Netherlands are scheduled to hold individual talks with Acheson today. The Great Hall of the State Department is being actively decorated in preparation for the treaty signing ceremony on the 4th. Although President Truman will attend only as a guest, he will be present to deliver a speech.</p>
<h3 id="e32">A Diplomatic Dilemma in the Treaty Signing Ceremony: Should the Soviet Ambassador Be Invited to Attend? <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 31st] The Treaty Division of the U.S. State Department is trying to find a win-win solution to avoid inviting the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S., Pan Youxin, to the signing ceremony of the Atlantic Treaty. Experts in the Treaty Division have been racking their brains all week to resolve this matter. For a treaty signing ceremony like this, all diplomatic envoys in the U.S. should be invited as a matter of etiquette, including Pan Youxin. Another common approach is not to invite anyone. However, the State Department only wants to invite foreign envoys who are sympathetic to the Atlantic Treaty, which seems to have two solutions: Perhaps Pan Youxin will not come; or simply invite all foreign envoys and risk a confrontation, or perhaps Pan Youxin will refuse to attend the ceremony. (2) Take a risk and only invite foreign envoys welcomed by the United States, risking condemnation from the Soviet Union. The protocol authorities now believe they have finally found a solution, as it is rumored that foreign envoys willing to participate in the ceremony have hinted, what if Pan Youxin really comes? Only heaven knows.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Internal Division in Bulgaria: Rumors of Deputy Prime Minister Under House Arrest <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 1st] Despite denials from Bulgarian officials, rumors of a major split among Bulgarian Communist leaders continued to circulate on the 1st. The Yugoslav official news agency "Tanjug" reported that 100 Bulgarian Communists had been arrested in Bulgaria on charges of espionage. A Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman dismissed the report as "absurd and unfounded," but Western diplomats claim to have reliable information that a split is underway within the Bulgarian Communist Party. The split is reportedly between Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov and Deputy Prime Minister Kostov. Dimitrov is a key member of the Comintern, while Kostov, once considered Dimitrov's most likely successor, is a domestic Communist who may oppose taking orders from Moscow. Western sources here say that Kostov is now under house arrest, which is consistent with what "Tanjug" reported.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Bangkok, 31st] At a meeting of the Comprehensive Group of the Economic Commission for the Far East and Asia today, Chinese representative Li Zhuomin spoke out against Japan becoming a major industrial nation in Asia again. It is said that most Asian countries have recognized that Japan is developing into a new war machine. Japan's lack of U.S. dollars is a direct result of Japan's launching of war. Earlier, Major General Cushing, representative of MacArthur's headquarters, stated that those controlling Japanese organizations felt that Japan's future trading methods must change in order to export machinery and production equipment. In the next five years, Japan can export goods worth 200 million yuan annually.</p>
<p>MacArthur's headquarters encouraged barter trade agreements in order to obtain supplies of raw materials and food. Indian representative Yadaka stated that some Asian countries fear Japan's development. Soviet representative Nencheina stated that the group had no right to discuss any aspect of the Japanese economy, and that economic issues should be discussed by the Far Eastern Commission or other controlling organizations. Also, at a meeting of the Industrial Group, French representative Mao Helie listed the dangers of allowing Japan to manufacture steel, and the Chinese representative supported the French position.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Churchill Delivers Speech in Boston, Calling on the World to Defend Freedom, Condemning the Soviet Union's Attempt to Dominate the World; Concerned About the Situation in China, Calling it a Tragedy Since Victory <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Boston, Massachusetts, 31st] Churchill delivered a world-renowned speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tonight, stating that the incorporation of China and India into the Communist empire controlled by the Kremlin would undoubtedly bring endless bloodshed and suffering to 800 to 900 million people. Churchill also said that if the United States did not possess the atomic bomb, Europe might have already been communized some time ago, and London might have already been bombed. Churchill accused the thirteen giants in the Kremlin of suppressing hundreds of millions of people and attempting to dominate the world. Today, Europe is shrouded in the shadow of fear.</p>
<p>Churchill also loudly appealed: We must take care of both Asia and Europe at the same time. In Europe, the situation is fortunately maintained thanks to the Berlin Airlift, but in Asia, China's submission to Communist attacks and conspiracies is the worst tragedy of the Allied victory in World War II.</p>
<p>More Cunning Than Hitler</p>
<p>Christian culture is now facing a more cunning and powerful force than Hitler, and the unity of the English-speaking nations is currently the only way to save ourselves. Behind the Kremlin, there are envoys stationed in every country as its fifth column, and there is the world's largest army, controlled by a government that is implementing a policy of imperialist expansion even worse than the Tsars or the German emperors. But Churchill also said: War is not inevitable. He does not advocate taking violent action immediately, and hope and patience should not be abandoned immediately. Many beneficial methods are already being launched. Under the threat of communism, free countries have engaged in unprecedented unity. Churchill strongly stated that we have no animosity towards the Soviet people, nor do we intend to deny their legitimate rights and security. Our goals and principles remain unchanged, and we are willing to view Russians around the world as brothers in the human family. What we ask of the Soviet Union is only goodwill and fairness. However, if a war of nerves has already begun, then we must develop our strong nerves. We will unite all thoughts and superhuman science to defend freedom. This is the best way to avoid a third world war, and it is also the surest way to survive this crisis without enslavement and destruction.</p>
<p>More Than 10,000 Audience Members</p>
<p>British wartime Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology memorial event in Boston Garden. There were 14,000 audience members in the venue, and the three major British broadcasting companies also used radio and fax machines to transmit Churchill's speech to various places. His audience, including some of the world's most famous scientists, were all intently absorbing the speech of this premier contemporary speaker. The numbers at the end of Churchill's speech reminded people of his famous speeches during the war. He said, "Let us bravely move forward and fulfill our mission and responsibility, fearing nothing except God." Other key points in Churchill's speech are as follows: He said that one of the characteristics of the twentieth century is that more people have been able to share the lives previously enjoyed by a few. We all wish that the masses in every land can have adequate food and clothing, then only continuous improvement of technology production and improvement of the education of hundreds of millions of men and women can achieve this, even in the current dark period, I still believe this can be done. We now have all the resources of modern science. If we still cannot avoid world famine, it should be blamed on all of us, and scientists in particular should be responsible. If scientists cannot do this, then humanity will inevitably conflict due to unequal enjoyment.</p>
<p>Avoiding a Third World War</p>
<p>Churchill also said that the United Nations organization has lost its effectiveness due to Soviet hostility and the division between communism and the rest of humanity, but we must not be discouraged, we must unite all superhuman thoughts and scientific forces to defend freedom. This is the best hope for avoiding a third world war, and it is also the only way to avoid recovery and destruction. The Soviet Union fears the friendship of Western countries more than the hostility of Western countries, so the Soviet Union has adopted a shocking policy of not allowing friendly relations to develop in the areas it controls. Churchill believes that the twentieth century is a century full of storms and changes.</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Rice prices have been soaring continuously in recent days. Yesterday, white japonica rice rose to 117,000 yuan per dan, and the retail price of rice has broken through the 120,000 yuan mark. Due to the skyrocketing rice prices, the common people are all complaining endlessly. The city government authorities are paying close attention to this matter. Yesterday afternoon, City Secretary-General Chen Liang convened responsible persons from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Civil Food Allocation Office, the Grain Emergency Procurement and Storage Committee, the Rice Industry Association, the North and South Rice Markets, and other agencies and organizations to hold an emergency meeting. There was a thorough discussion of the reasons for the skyrocketing rice prices and ways to suppress them. Two solutions were decided upon: (1) Strictly prohibit off-market transactions in the rice market that arbitrarily raise prices. (2) Find ways to dredge grain sources so that the supply of rice in the city is not in short supply. Starting today, the Social Affairs Bureau will send senior officials to the North and South Rice Markets to supervise and stop illegal merchants from bidding prices outside the market. According to responsible persons in the rice market, the reasons for the skyrocketing rice prices are: (1) The release of 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan banknotes. (2) The publication of the index, causing prices to generally rise by about 20%. (3) Prices in the producing areas have risen, and the source of supply is not smooth. It is said that these three factors have stimulated this crazy surge in rice prices.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Shanghai Central Government Employee Representatives Petition Finance Minister Liu for Salary <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The March salaries for public education employees in the Beijing-Shanghai area have been approved by the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference on March 29th, at 2,700 times the base salary, which is only 80% of the Shanghai employee cost of living index for the second half of March, which is 3,402 times the base salary. It is still unknown when they will be able to receive it, and the price of silver dollars has doubled in three days, while other prices have also risen sharply. Some public education employees in this city only received 75 times the base salary in March, and they are all in dire straits and unable to make ends meet. The Shanghai Central Government Agencies Employee Friendship Association specially sent representatives yesterday to visit Finance Minister Liu with a petition, requesting that the supplementary amount for March be paid first, and that the advance amount for April be paid before April 5th. Also, if there is a shortage of cash when salaries are paid, please issue newly minted silver dollars. The result of the request was that the remedial measures for adjusting the salaries of central government agencies announced by the Ministry of Finance on March 9th have not been approved by the Executive Yuan, and the procedures for allocating funds still need to be discussed. Moreover, the required banknotes also need to be planned. It was agreed that a remedial plan would be studied immediately and allocated immediately to appease the public. Today, the representatives may continue to request the National Treasury authorities to quickly issue emergency relief.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the successive occurrence of the boxed corpse case and the dismembered corpse case in this city, the Garrison Headquarters attaches great importance to these tragic cases, which have greatly affected public security and morale. In addition to instructing the relevant public security agencies to investigate strictly, it has also convened a meeting of the Railway Bureau Police Department, the Police Bureau, the Station Inspection Office, and the Inspection Brigade to conduct extensive discussions on the two cases and decide on the following steps: (1) Request the two Railway Bureaus and the Police Bureau to continue to disclose the process of discovering the corpses or the methods of identifying the corpses, and issue documents to remote areas along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, in the hope of obtaining the names of the deceased. (2) The two Railway Bureaus and the Police Bureau will again publicly offer high rewards for solving the cases, in the hope of discovering clues. (3) Investigate the names of criminals recently released from prison through various channels. (4) Order the land, sea, and air inspection stations to strengthen inspections to prevent similar cases from happening again. (5) Instruct the units responsible for solving the cases to send reports on the progress of the cases to the headquarters for reference at any time. It is also learned that the Police Bureau's Detective Section has also formed a special detective team to conduct investigations into the dismembered corpse case in conjunction with relevant parties. Some progress has been made in the two cases, and strict investigations are continuing.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Student Relief Association and Other Organizations Visit University Dining Halls: Red Rice and a Few Vegetables, Poor Nutrition Leads to More Lung Disease <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Representatives from the National Student Relief Committee of the Chinese Christian YMCA, the Shanghai Student Relief Association, the Chinese Nutrition Promotion Association, and the Welfare Committee of the International Student Chapel, among other organizations, visited the student dining halls of Tongji and Fudan Universities at 4:00 PM yesterday and invited reporters to accompany them. The reason for this was that the Student Relief Association recently received a letter from a group of national university government-sponsored students, stating that the government subsidies for March totaled 8,000 yuan, of which only 2,000 yuan was for vegetables, after deducting expenses for rice, firewood, oil, salt, and other necessities. This averaged 64 yuan per day, so they could only eat "hollowed-out radishes" and "flowering vegetable tips," with no nutrition at all. Some self-funded and partially self-funded students were even unable to pay this amount and would be forced to stop eating at the dining halls. The Chinese Nutrition Promotion Association analyzed the poor nutrition situation of the students, and the Student Relief Association investigated the students' health. The results showed that the percentage of students with lung disease was very high. This serious phenomenon was entirely due to malnutrition. Tongji students now eat only two meals a day, taking a separate meal system. What they eat is red rice plus a few oil-free vegetables. Fudan students eat at tables of eight, and what they eat is also two vegetarian dishes. Students with money can add dishes to their meals, but those without money can only swallow this unnutritious rice and vegetables every day, and the amount of vegetables is limited. After a bowl of rice, there are no vegetables left, so they simply fill their stomachs with red rice. The representatives who visited yesterday witnessed this situation and unanimously agreed that it was necessary to provide relief and improvement, otherwise, the result of several years of university education would only be many malnourished young people with lung disease. The Student Relief Association is currently studying how to regularly add dishes to the meals of poor students to supplement their nutrition. However, because the funds subsidized by foreign countries are limited, it is hoped that all sectors of society and the government will pay attention to this serious problem and provide poor students with sufficient and adequate nutrition.</p>

<p>About 300 students from North China and Northeast China who have fled to Shanghai are currently living in the Caohejing Refugee Camp. Life there is quite inconvenient. They have established the Northeast and North China Shanghai Student Association. Yesterday, they sent seven representatives to Beijing by night train to request instructions from the Ministry of Education on the issue of schools for temporary study and to urge Minister Hang to actively plan for the establishment of a Southeast United University to accommodate them. The students living in the refugee camp are mostly sharing one cotton quilt provided by the refugee camp between two people, and the clothes they brought have almost all been sold. It is hoped that the education authorities and people from all walks of life will cooperate to solve the most urgent problems of clothing, food, and housing for them.</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Annual Embellishment: Many "April Fool's" Lies, Countless Strange News, Seeking Pleasure by Any Means <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the "April Fool's Day" of 1949, and people from all walks of life had long been wary, fearing being fooled. However, news intended to fool people still appeared a lot during the day. The most moving was the rumor that Bei Zuyi telegraphed from the United States that the US government had approved a silver loan of 500 million ounces, and that the National Bank had designated Lin Chongyong to go to Washington to negotiate transportation matters. This news initially made a group of bulls in the market very excited, but after two more sober-minded people pointed it out, the transaction continued as before, without any impact. In addition, at noon, many people in the office area were running around spreading the word: Acting President Li had ordered a ceasefire in the early morning, Mao Zedong had another relapse of cerebral congestion, and Song Ziwen was suddenly assassinated and died, etc. It is said that these were all urgent telegrams from Nanjing, absolutely true, but in the end, after an inquiry, it was just laughed off.</p>
<p>The April Fool's Day news did not end there. In the afternoon, someone said that Zhang Xueliang had been released to Shanghai and was staying at the Cathay Hotel, causing reporters to run to the Cathay Hotel and ask Manager Lin several times. Some evening newspapers published that Miss Liu Banye, head of the Municipal Government's Protocol Section, was engaged at the Hua Mao Hotel in the afternoon, but the news did not mention the name of her "husband" at all. There was also a rumor that Zhu Xubai, head of the News Office, won the first prize in the last charity lottery. Zhu told people: "If it's true, that would be great!" There was also a bad one, which was Fan Xuejun. A newspaper said that she committed suicide by poisoning the night before and was scheduled to be cremated at the Chinese Funeral Home yesterday afternoon, and also published a "portrait." Heaven knows, Fan Xuejun was still excitedly rushing to the various book venues yesterday afternoon!</p>
<p>The newspaper received a submission from a reader the day before yesterday, which said that "young writer Sun Yuehan has committed suicide by jumping off the 14th floor of the International Hotel." The letter also included a photo of Sun, who looked very handsome. This was of course good news, but after the reporter carefully reviewed it, a flaw appeared. Perhaps this friend seeking pleasure did not notice that his letter said that Sun's suicide time was around 5:00 PM on the 31st, but the time we received the letter on that day was not yet 4:00!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Soong Ching-ling's China Welfare Fund invited the press yesterday to visit the three children's welfare stations and the children's theater troupe established by the fund.</p>
<p>Children's drama work is still in its infancy in our country. The children's theater troupe of the fund has been established for two years and is a theater troupe for children and belonging to children. It has performed two plays, "The Watch" and "The Little Circus," at the Lanxin Theater, and often performs for free in poor areas. Statistics show that there have been 100,000 little audience members. Currently, there are 34 members, aged ten to eighteen, all of whom are poor children recruited through open examinations. The courses are divided into two classes, A and B. Each class is set for one year. Classes are held for six hours a day. In addition to the main subjects of music, dance, and drama, subjects such as Chinese, general knowledge, and arithmetic are also taught. Students in Class B are responsible for their own meals. After completing the basic course for one year, they will be promoted to Class A and can enjoy government-funded treatment, with the theater troupe bearing the living expenses. In one year, they must learn to teach others (be a little teacher), sing, make scenery, write articles, make costumes, dance, manage lighting, and act. Recently, the theater troupe created a puppet show, "Happy Days," which is deeply educational and has been very successful. It is currently planning to adapt and perform "The Adventures of Sanmao." These days, because Children's Day is approaching, elementary schools, people's schools, poor children's homes, reformatories, and other institutions have been contacting the troupe to perform song and dance dramas. From March 30th to April 6th, the troupe has scheduled programs and will be running around east and west every day, performing a total of fourteen shows. In the future, it is also preparing to perform a free matinee performance at the Municipal Drama School every other Sunday.</p>
<p>The China Welfare Fund Currently Has Three Major Tasks</p>
<p>In addition to the "Sanmao Paradise Movement" currently underway, the current work of the China Welfare Fund roughly consists of three parts: (1) Education work, divided into literacy classes and libraries. There are already one hundred literacy classes with more than 2,500 students. The library collects various children's books, and more than 1,000 children go to read every week. The children's library at the First Children's Welfare Station is the second largest in the city. (2) Health and nutrition work: Each children's welfare station now has a clinic to treat children's diseases and provide vaccinations. In addition, more than 1,200 poor infants under twelve months of age can receive three pounds of milk powder per month, and cod liver oil is often distributed. (3) Material distribution: When the fund's welfare stations receive donations from abroad or materials allocated domestically, they are distributed to the poor in need. The distributed materials include old clothes, cloth, and sweep-floor rice. In addition, there is a work-for-relief program, teaching the older girls in the literacy classes to sew clothes for other children. The most important work of each children's welfare station is to make home visits to nearby poor areas and assist in solving various difficult problems such as education and medical care. Currently, a mother's meeting is held every week to implement health and nutrition county education work for mothers.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, many public education employees and students from Peiping and Tientsin have come to Shanghai via Qingdao and Pukou. The Garrison Command has reached an agreement with the Qingdao public security authorities, and Qingdao is responsible for reviewing identities and imposing restrictions. Those who meet one of the following conditions may be allowed to go south: (1) Those who are oppressed by life, (2) Those who voluntarily do not want to stay in the north, (3) Government public education employees who are willing to return to the south. When the above-mentioned personnel arrive in Shanghai, the public security agencies in this city will still conduct inspections.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, a spokesman for the Songhu Garrison Command said: Recently, a small number of students from colleges and universities in this city, such as Fudan and Jiaotong Universities, often take advantage of opportunities to make various excuses and engage in transgressions. For example: (1) Under the pretext of improving treatment, they launch "eat-everything movements," "grievance meetings," and "struggle for survival meetings." (2) They use various gatherings to perform Communist Yangko dances to expand anti-government propaganda. (3) They sing songs welcoming the "Liberation Army" to cross the river. (4) They post slogans insulting the government. (5) They use spring outings to preach to officers and soldiers, undermining military morale. (6) During student union elections, they use the names of Communist army leaders as campaign slogans, such as "Fudan's Mao Zedong." The spokesman said: Although peace talks are about to officially begin, the Communist Party is actively conducting military operations, and it is even more important to maintain public security in the Songhu area. The headquarters will strictly suppress assemblies, petitions, marches, and propaganda that violate the martial law in accordance with the law. If the students do not accept persuasion and insist on going their own way, ignoring right and wrong, the headquarters is willing to find a way to send them to the Communist area for observation and comparison.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At Chen Guoqing's home at No. 434 Qimei Road in Pudong at about 2:20 AM yesterday, four robbers suddenly arrived, claiming to be military police searching the house. They knocked on the door and entered, revealing firearms. They robbed a lot of gold jewelry and clothing. Before leaving, because the victim Chen Guoqing attempted to resist, they drew their guns and fired two shots, hitting his chest and arms. They took the opportunity to escape. Neighbors heard the noise and came to take Chen to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for treatment, where his life is in danger.</p>
<p>At No. 63, Lane 601, Taixing Road, at about 7:55 PM the night before last, two robbers suddenly arrived. One robber held a gun to intimidate the victim and robbed three gold rings and a pair of earrings before escaping.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A young man in a suit suddenly came to the Datong Leather Shoe Store at No. 369 Tibet Road Central a few days ago and selected a pair of men's leather shoes, a pair of women's leather shoes, and a women's leather bag. He ordered the shop assistant Ma Guohong to take them to Room 204, Yiyilou, Nanjing Road. He paid with a cross-city check from a certain bank on Yunnan Road. Ma went to the bank to cash the check but was rejected. He returned to the original place, but the young man had disappeared without a trace. Knowing that he had been cheated, he reported the situation to the Laozha Police Sub-bureau for investigation. Unexpectedly, the next day, a customer came to the Lidu Department Store at No. 51 Nanjing West Road and selected a shirt, a tie, a wool sweater, and two vests, worth a total of 257,000 yuan. He instructed the clerk to deliver them to Room 204, East Asia Hotel, and then gave a check from the Asia-West Bank. When the check was cashed, it was rejected as before. The guest could not be found, and he was gone as before. The Laozha Police Sub-bureau considered that the circumstances of the two cases were the same and ordered police officers to investigate in all directions. Sure enough, at about 8:00 PM yesterday, they received a tip that a gangster was committing fraud at No. 3, Yong'anli, Jiangning Road. They ordered officers to rush to the scene and arrest him. According to his confession, his name is Han Wenlong, 22 years old, from Ningbo, and he lives at No. 14, Deshengli, Guohuo Road, Nanshi. Because he had been unemployed for a long time, he was forced to resort to this strategy for a living.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Public Education Personnel Material Supply Committee held a routine meeting yesterday, chaired by Zeng Gangfu, Chief Secretary of the Supply Committee. The following matters were resolved: (1) The policy of material distribution to public education personnel has been newly decided by the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference, but no formal order has arrived, and it is not convenient to handle it without authorization. The issuance of all April material purchase certificates will be temporarily postponed (the key rice distribution certificates will still be issued as usual, issuing them on the 4th to central and Jiangsu provincial agencies stationed in Shanghai, and on the 5th to municipal agencies). As to whether the purchase certificates will be reissued, and if they are replaced with cash, how municipal public education employees will receive them, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (2) The Executive Yuan has decided to replace the undistributed cooking oil and coal for January, February, and March of this year with cash. Please ask the Executive Yuan to issue the cash as soon as possible, and please calculate the cash amount based on the market price at the time of issuance. In the future, the calculation of various cash amounts should also be based on the market price at the time of issuance. As for the undistributed cooking oil for December of last year, please still distribute the actual goods. (3) How to handle the summer clothing distribution for this year, please ask the Executive Yuan for approval. (4) The rice cash and oil-coal difference cash for April will also be temporarily postponed due to the postponement of the issuance of material purchase certificates. (5) The deadline for exchanging the March material purchase certificate for rice is extended to the 7th of this month. The deadline for exchanging rice cash is also the 7th. In addition, Chief Secretary Zeng of the committee will go to Beijing in the middle of next week to ask the Executive Yuan for instructions on various distribution-related issues.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Japanese "Scalper" Found at Hangzhou Station, Passengers Deceived and Report to the Police, Arrested. Claims to Have Served as Lieutenant Medical Officer, Escorted to Shanghai to Consider Handling Method <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Due to the increasing number of tourists on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines in recent days, the number of passengers is gradually becoming crowded, and "scalpers" have emerged. The Railway Bureau Police Department has dispatched a large number of police officers to strictly investigate and prohibit them at major stations. A person dressed in a railway worker's uniform who claimed to be Wang Yougui recently appeared in Hangzhou, specializing in buying train tickets for passengers. As a result, he defrauded 16,000 yuan in ticket money and absconded elsewhere. The deceived passengers reported to the railway police. The police section immediately dispatched plainclothes police to investigate and finally arrested the criminal. After questioning, it was discovered that he was actually Japanese, fluent in Nanjing dialect. According to his confession, his name is Maruyama Taiji. In March of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), he came to our country with the "Dispatch Army" and was stationed in Hankou. His rank was lieutenant medical officer. After the Japanese army surrendered, he left the troops and hid in the countryside of Nanjing, setting up a clinic to treat villagers. Because the Communist Party later disturbed the area, he was forced to close down and faced financial difficulties. In March of this year, he borrowed a railway worker's uniform from his friend Ye Minfu at No. 9 Baixia Road, Nanjing, and took a train to Hangzhou to find work. After arriving in Hangzhou, he was penniless and was forced to resort to this strategy. The criminal was transferred from Hangzhou to Shanghai yesterday and is temporarily detained in the Railway Bureau's directly affiliated police station detention center. Because Maruyama Taiji has the status of an enemy prisoner, the railway police authorities are currently considering how to handle the case.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Circus Owner's Inheritance Lawsuit After Death <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Sun Fuyou, the owner of a circus, married a Russian woman named Gari while performing abroad in his early years. He then returned to China with her. Gari naturalized and changed her name to Luo Zhangqi. Later, Sun died in Shanghai in the spring of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945). Luo intended to donate a Western-style house and its site at No. 31, Model District, Jiangwan Road, to Sun Yilian, the granddaughter of her deceased husband's other wife. She invited witness Yu Shanchang to apply for a donation registration with the Municipal Land Administration Bureau. Before it was completed, Sun Huiping, Sun's third wife, and her son, Sun Baoshi, and others returned after the war, believing that the house and land were Sun's inheritance and should be inherited by his son. They also applied for a change of registration with the Land Administration Bureau. Luo alleged that the title deeds for the houses and land were all in Luo's name, and that Sun and others were obviously applying for a change of registration with forged documents. She filed a criminal lawsuit with the District Court. The court had advised both parties to reconcile but to no avail. It was opened for trial again yesterday. According to Luo, the property was purchased with her private savings, and she is now willing to donate it to Sun Yilian, Sun's granddaughter. At that time, the registration procedures had not been completed, and Sun Huiping and others returned and falsely claimed that they were willing to urge the completion of the procedures. She</p>
<p>obtained her private seal, counterfeited Sun Yilian's seal, and obtained Luo's identity information, colluding with original witness Yu Shanchang to invite Wang Jinzhen as a witness, forging a donation certificate stating that Luo had changed the donation of the aforementioned property to Sun Baoshi. She claimed a change of registration with the Land Administration Bureau. After it was discovered, she filed a complaint and now only wishes for a judgment ordering the return of the property to Sun Yilian. Defendant Sun Huiping stated: She and Sun Fuyou were married at the Anle Restaurant in Nanjing in September of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933) and had five children. Sun Baoshi is her eldest son. The property was purchased by her and her husband from the Shanghai Trust Company in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). Luo Zhangqi's name is actually</p>
<p>her husband's alias. She gave the title deeds to Luo for safekeeping. Luo then took possession of them as her own. Because she was performing in a circus abroad, and after hearing of her husband's death, she rushed back to Shanghai in March of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), due to obstructed roads at the time. Luo had already registered the property in the name of Sun Yilian with the Land Administration Bureau. She raised an objection. At that time, Luo and Sun both agreed to change the registration to Sun Baoshi's name and signed a document. Unexpectedly, they suddenly reneged and also accused witnesses Yu Shanchang and Wang Jinzhen, to prevent fair statements, which is obviously a false accusation. She requests a clear judgment. The court held that the two sides held different views and could not agree, and decided to authenticate the handwriting as the basis for the judgment. It was announced that the trial would be rescheduled and both parties were advised that since they belonged to the same family, they should keep in mind the psychology that taking a loss is a benefit and not be too excessive.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Yihua, who assaulted his father, Li Guozhi, was sentenced to four years of imprisonment by the District Court yesterday. It is reported that his father, Li Guozhi, runs the Tiancheng Teahouse on Jiaozhou Road. Although Yihua is an adult, he does not pursue an honest living and repeatedly demanded that his father entrust him with managing the Tiancheng business, so that he could spend extravagantly. His father refused. On the third of last month, he again used this as an excuse to propose severing the father-son relationship, demanding that his father hand over ten gold bars. When this was also not granted, Yihua gathered a group of hooligans to the shop and severely beat Guozhi, causing injuries. His younger brother, Yiyun, who tried to dissuade him, was also severely beaten. Guozhi then endured the pain and reported the incident to the police, who arrested and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The sentence was pronounced as above.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Workers at the Central Aviation Corporation at Longhua Airport received their paychecks yesterday. The total amount of wages was approximately hundreds of millions of yuan. The company authorities, citing the recent cash shortage, issued crossed promissory notes to all workers. When the payments were made yesterday evening, the workers refused to accept them, arguing that using promissory notes would result in a discount and that crossed promissory notes had to be sent to the bank for clearing. They added that most of them do not have bank accounts. They expressed strong dissatisfaction with the company's measure and gathered at the airport to demand that they be paid in cash. Senior officials from the company's aviation group tried their best to persuade them, but the issue remained unresolved late into the night.</p>

<h3 id="e77">The Northeastern Edge of Zhejiang (Part 1) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 1st] The northeastern edge of Zhejiang Province includes ten counties: Wuxing, Changxing, Deqing, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Haiyan, Haining, Chongde, and Tongxiang. Within this area originate the East and West Tai Creeks, which originate from East and West Tianmu Mountains respectively. They flow through Wuxing, merge, and flow towards the two outlets of Daqian and Xiaomei, emptying into Tai Lake. There are also two canals: one is the Grand Canal, which runs from Wujiang in Jiangsu, south through Jiaxing to Hangzhou; the other is the Dongtang Canal, which runs from Wujiang to Wuxing. The branches of these canals connect in all directions, and the entire area has diverging ports and rivers. With its clear mountains, beautiful waters, and fertile land, it is a prosperous region of Jiangnan. It borders the East China Sea to the east, with a coastline extending westward from Haining and eastward through Haiyan to Quan Gongting in Pinghu, bordering Jinshanwei in Jinshan, Jiangsu. It was from this area that the Japanese enemies landed in 1937. It borders Tai Lake to the north, facing Wuxi in Jiangsu across the lake. The coastline extends westward from Fuziling in Changxing, bordering Yixing, and eastward to Hulu in Wuxing, bordering Wujiang in Jiangsu, with Daqian and Xiaomei in Wuxing being the largest gaps along the coast. The Taiping rebels landed here in the past and captured Wuxing. To the northwest lies the border region of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, starting from Fuziling in Changxing, passing through Xuanjiaoling and Xiangwangling, bordering Yixing in Jiangsu, and then from Baixianling, passing through Qingniuling, to Jiepai, bordering Guangde in Anhui. Further west are Anji and Xiaofeng. In October 1943, the Communist army entered the Baixian Coal Mountain and Cotton Hangkeng area from Yixing.</p>
<p>The Peaceful First District</p>
<p>On this northeastern edge of Zhejiang, there is undoubtedly the notoriously unstable Tai Lake, the complex border region of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the national border line bordering the East China Sea, so its position is quite important. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has designated it as the First District. Mr. Shuluan is the Administrative Inspector Commissioner, and Mr. Yu has been serving as the Commissioner in this area for ten years. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has also changed chairmen. Under Mr. Yu's administration, this area is indeed very peaceful. Recently, the southeastern and western regions of Zhejiang Province have been rather unstable. Even Lin'an, which this reporter left in April in a state of peace, has signs of unease. Only the northeastern border region remains quiet and peaceful, without any disturbances. This reporter once again took a special bus provided by the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Joint Operating Office for the press corps to the Wuxing area for on-the-spot investigation. I deeply feel that in Changxing, this border between Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, separated by only a mountain, is the area where the Communist army is active. Vast Tai Lake, and Dongshan and Xishan Islands within it, are also places where the Communist army frequently appears. However, this area has always maintained peace and tranquility. For example, in 1948, there were nine robbery cases in Wuxing and Jiaxing counties, four in Jiashan, two in Chongde, and three in Haiyan, totaling 27 cases for the year. No theft cases occurred in other counties, which can be considered a satisfactory state of peace.</p>

<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Based on a tip, the Third Stationed Detachment of the Railway Police Section arrested more than ten habitual thieves in Room 21 of the Weiying Hotel at Qianwanli Bridge on the morning of the 31st. They were escorted to the City Defense Department for interrogation.</p>
<p>Wujin</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the large-scale search at Houting Bridge on the border between Wujin and Danyang, the work of the First Joint Defense Zone of the Provincial Security Office continued, targeting the Anjiashe district along the Yangtze River in northern Wujin. At 3:00 AM on the 29th, Commander Zhang Da personally led the security police team, along with the chief of staff, the chief of the police局, and the head of the security regiment, departing from the city. By 5:30 AM, before dawn, the police and soldiers had reached the designated area. They suddenly and unexpectedly imposed a curfew, conducting searches village by village. They first captured accomplice Mei Jinfu in Meijia Village, Baishen Township. They arrested Principal Wu Xueli and others at the Dabatou National Elementary School in Xinqiao Township, and confiscated various propaganda materials in the school. In other villages, they arrested more than ten suspects, including Chen Zhenxin, Wan Xihai, Ding Huaqing, Yao Zailiang, Xu Lifang, Zhu Dalong, Wang Jinsheng, Zang Weisheng, Xu Fuda, and Song Fugen. At 2:00 PM, a mass meeting of the people was convened in Xiaoxinqiao for the township chiefs and residents of Anjia District, with over a thousand participants. Commander Zhang personally presided over the meeting, delivering a speech in public and announcing Mei Jinfu's crimes. He was then executed on the spot, and the remaining prisoners were taken to the city for interrogation. Spring has arrived in Jiangnan, but the chill has not completely dissipated. Everywhere, the small peach blossoms are reddening, swaying in the spring light. This sweeping rectification by the First Joint Defense Zone is undoubtedly a harsh awakening.</p>

Zhu Yunjiang and Yang Jincai were arrested in Dongjia, and they were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The remaining bandits fled upon hearing the news.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Central Bank issued 50,000-yuan fixed-amount promissory notes, it issued two more types of large bills yesterday, 5,000-yuan and 10,000-yuan, and also issued a 100,000-yuan promissory note to meet the salary needs of various circles. The withdrawal limit for banks and businesses was also increased again yesterday to 30% of the deposit balance, of which 60% was paid in cash and 40% was paid in promissory notes. After this relaxation, the authorities of the National Bank hope to slightly suppress the tight cash situation. According to a relevant official from the Business Bureau of the bank, the National Bank has now increased the withdrawal limit for banks and businesses to the highest amount. As a bank for banks, the National Bank is doing its best to solve the difficulties of banks. However, some banks, in addition to withdrawing their own limit of cash, also issue notes to their customers and bring them to the National Bank for cashing. The National Bank could have ignored this and instructed them to negotiate directly with the issuing bank, but in consideration of the situation, it still tries its best to cope with it. It is believed that the cash shortage phenomenon can be improved after recent remedial measures.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market was chaotic at the opening, because the Central Bank issued 5,000- and 10,000-yuan bills, and people were excited, shouting as high as 985,000, the price limit, with no supply to meet demand. Buying and selling were rejected for a long time. Until around 10:00 AM, the Central Bank entrusted Dadecheng Gold Shop to sell 2,629 large taels at 983,000, squeezing in 25.84 billion yuan, and people's hearts turned peaceful and buying was relieved. The transaction was opened up, falling slightly to 979,000. The noon closing was 980,000.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, due to the rumor of the success of the silver loan, some banks and businesses were said to be shaky, and money was tight, with secret interest rates reaching 1 yuan and 2 jiao, and people were soft, and selling was strong. Bank-related and securities-related parties came out one after another, opening at 975,000 and falling to 950,000. Near the close, because silver shops had some appetite, it rebounded to 964,000, an increase of 69,000 from the previous day. The combined interest was only 7 jiao and 5 fen, and the interbank clearing price was 981,000 in the morning and 962,500 in the afternoon.</p>

The digestion of each gang has become sluggish, and there are rumors that the silver standard will be implemented soon, and the risk is quite large, so fewer people are willing to do it. All day long, only about 500,000 transactions were opened in South China and West China. Due to the active spending of retail investors, the market continued to rise on the road. The big heads shouted 17,000, 18,000 in the morning, and once rose to 17,500, 18,500. In the afternoon, it was slightly lower to 17,000, 18,000. The small heads shouted 14,000, 15,000.

Soybean oil rose by 80,000, and rapeseed oil opened at 90,000, but then fell back by 30,000, for a total increase of 60,000. Raw oil also rose by 60,000. Only soybean cake rose slightly by 2,000 to 3,000 due to poor sales.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The rising trend has become even more intense. The issuance of large bills has stimulated people's hearts, and the price of rice has soared. The morning opening prices of all brands of flour broke through four levels. The closing price of old car flour was as high as 44,500 yuan. The warship Northern Gang納進 was still strong, and the market was rising step by step. The later market rose to 42,500 yuan, an increase of 20%. Bran sales were extremely smooth, and the price rose by more than 20%, with large packages selling for 36,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The market situation was mixed. At the beginning of the market, all items rose together, and soybeans broke through the ten-thousand mark. Car beans once shouted as high as 110,000. In the later market, money was tight, and oil cake turned weak and fell back to 16,000, guarding the ten-thousand mark, which was still about 20% higher than before. Raw kernels and corn had very sluggish sales, and the market hovered. Mung beans rose by 20%, and red sorghum叩五關.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tung oil market saw the resurgence of price increases. However, due to the weakness of domestic and foreign sales areas and the tight positions of colleagues, the magnitude has not expanded, and it has risen by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan compared with before.</p>

<h3 id="e88">New Tea Priced in Rice <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to tea industry insiders: New tea from Zhejiang province is about to enter the market. Our city's businesses have already dispatched personnel to the production areas to investigate the new tea situation. We have just learned that this year, due to unfavorable weather, the harvest and production are inferior to previous years. However, tea farmers, feeling the alarming rise in commodity prices and the repeated depreciation of currency, are mostly considering pricing the tea in terms of rice. Generally, they are unwilling to sell 100 catties of new tea for less than about 10 shi (石， a unit of dry measure, approximately 100 liters) of white rice. If this measure becomes a reality, tea prices will undoubtedly skyrocket. However, whether actual sales will be smooth is difficult to predict, especially for export tea such as "Tun Green," where prices are currently inverted compared to foreign tea prices. Looking ahead, there is deep concern.</p>
<p>Yesterday, amidst various stimulating news, the tea market in our city was filled with empty shouts without any standard for the goods. The upward trend was difficult to restrain, and the ground was quite solid, but unfortunately, buying interest was very weak, and transactions were extremely narrow.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Illegal Issuance of Bank Drafts by Commercial Banks: The Financial Supervisory Bureau Dispatches Investigators <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Commercial bank drafts in our city are again flooding the market. To prevent abuses, the Financial Supervisory Bureau has dispatched investigators in batches. Bank drafts were originally issued in response to customer requests, and the face value is usually not fixed. The amount, date, and signature on the draft should be written in ink at the time of issuance. Since the autumn of last year, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that all banks must deposit an amount equal to the outstanding balance of bank drafts issued each day into the Central Bank at the end of the business day, and must not over-issue them. Recently, a few banks have violated these regulations, arbitrarily issuing drafts, either not at the request of customers, or pre-printing fixed-amount drafts with seals, or failing to deposit sufficient funds into the Central Bank to cover the outstanding balance of drafts issued that day. All of these are illegal. It is reported that the authorities are investigating and prosecuting these cases and have reiterated previous orders, instructing the Shanghai Banking, Money Exchange, and Trust Trade Association to quickly relay the instructions to all banks and trust companies for compliance. Any further violations will be severely punished upon verification. As for the fixed-amount bank drafts recently issued by the Central Bank to adjust the circulation of banknotes according to actual needs, they are regarded as legal tender. No other bank or money exchange is allowed to imitate their issuance.</p>

<p>— Platform Spectator</p>
<p>Central Bank Uses Brains on April Fool's Day: The American Loan Bank Was Just a Joke</p>
<p>Yesterday was April Fool's Day. According to custom, it's okay to fool people; not fooling people isn't modern. So, jokes abounded.</p>
<p>Amidst the wild fluctuations of the silver dollar ("Yuan Tou", a nickname for silver dollars), the Central Bank also had some fun. The bank's press office publicly announced to reporters that the Washington Telegraph reported that the American silver loan to China had been successfully negotiated.</p>
<p>This news spread to the market. People panicked, and the silver dollar took the brunt, falling sharply at one point. But it was soon seen through, and it rebounded strongly, with an even more intense reaction.</p>
<p>The harmful bank drafts became uglier yesterday.</p>
<p>On Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road, silver dollar dealers were holding stacks of bank drafts, shouting, "Want Central Bank drafts? 10,000 for 9,000!"</p>
<p>The reporter passed these two roads on business and was approached by people peddling Central Bank drafts more than ten times. They all said as they left, "No one wants them after hawking them around."</p>
<p>It is said that starting next week, national banks will have the exclusive right to issue bank drafts and will no longer allow commercial banks to issue them.</p>
<p>If this is true, the World Bank Law and the Negotiable Instruments Law will have been re-amended. But in reality, it is probably not true. Because the purpose of banks issuing drafts is to substitute for cash. If banks are not allowed to issue drafts, unless the Central Bank fully supplies cash funds and provides police protection for every customer withdrawing cash. The reason why customers request banks to issue drafts when withdrawing large amounts is to avoid the risks of transporting cash. If banks are not allowed to issue drafts, banks will have to pay in cash. Then, the customer's risk of transporting cash should be borne by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Tight Credit Causes Banks to Waver: Be Cautious in This Big Picture</p>
<p>The tight credit situation is increasing.</p>
<p>However, banks still had a massive difference of more than 10 billion yesterday. This shows the large capacity and broad scope of the market's appetite.</p>
<p>News of banks wavering was even more alarming yesterday. It is said that there are more than 20 banks, all with clearly identifiable names, including some with long histories.</p>
<p>Unless the cash shortage is resolved and the abuse of negotiable instruments is eliminated, the danger to banks is just beginning! Because customers want to quickly pay out the negotiable instruments they receive, without having to deposit them. Because depositing them is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but also incurs a day's interest.</p>
<p>Speaking of losing interest, the blame should be placed on the ban on cashing negotiable instruments on the same day. But it is also the banks taking the opportunity to exploit the situation and greedily profiting from one day's interest. So, it's another case of shooting oneself in the foot.</p>
<p>Today's news is not enough to change the market. But be very careful! The market may have major upheaval in the coming days.</p>
<p>But among all the changes, gold, cash, silver dollars, rice, and coal will not be bad; everything else is risky. The most likely risk is stocks.</p>
<p>Yesterday and today are good opportunities for the stock market to emerge.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Short Sellers Eagerly Cover: Chinese Stocks Become Lively at Close <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the Chinese stock market, the morning was sluggish due to the tightening of interbank lending by commercial banks. News that the Central Bank would massively sell gold, silver, and materials caused much concern. Although factors such as the issuance of large-denomination bank drafts and the lower interbank lending rate outside the market were positive, the market sentiment remained in a state of consolidation due to high implicit interest rates and heavy pressure from short sellers. Yung Spinning opened at 12 yuan. Old positions sold off frequently, falling to 11.30 yuan and 11.35 yuan. Gold Yarn traders continuously bought up, pushing the price back up to a new high of 12.60 yuan. Later, as gold prices declined and the credit crunch intensified, various traders started selling, and the price fell back to 11.90 yuan by the afternoon close.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks opened steadily in the morning, with significant fluctuations in between. They all stabilized at the close. New Light initially opened at 1.12 yuan, briefly surging to 1.25 yuan. After briefly seeing 1.06 yuan, it was strongly supported by behind-the-scenes buying near noon, finally closing high at 1.20 yuan. Mei Ya initially opened at 3.80 yuan, reaching a high of 3.90 yuan, before plunging to 3.35 yuan, and closing at 3.65 yuan in the afternoon. Jingfu, Jinglun, Qinxing, and Xinyi opened weakly and remained weak throughout the day. They briefly rose in the middle of the day but softened again at the close, resulting in a slight squeeze upwards. The remaining stocks showed mixed gains and losses.</p>
<p>After the Central Bank sold gold in the afternoon, the credit situation became tighter than in the morning. Opening prices initially declined, but short covering before the close boosted buying interest, and Yung Spinning rose to the daily limit at closing. Most other stocks rose to the daily limit. Except for New Asia, which fell by 0.32 yuan, most miscellaneous stocks rose by about 20%. The total transaction volume for the day was 4.8214 billion shares.</p>
<p>The over-the-counter foreign stock market was still strong yesterday. Opening prices for all stocks were brisk in the morning. Yi Spinning traded at 30,000 yuan and 32,000 yuan. British Union traded at 35,000 yuan and 37,000 yuan, up 3,000 yuan. Ye Guang traded at 9,500 yuan and 10,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan. Asia traded at 3,300 yuan and 3,400 yuan. Wheelock traded at 110,000 yuan and 115,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. The remaining stocks were also favorable.</p>
<p>Gold Bonds opened in the morning with bids at 550,000 yuan, rising all the way to 650,000 yuan, closing at 590,000 yuan in the afternoon, but there were no transactions. There were no transactions in the afternoon market.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Yarn Prices Slightly Recover at Close: Cotton Cloth Initially Firm, then Declines <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton yarn continued to be strong. The tight credit situation in the industry persisted, and most buyers remained in a wait-and-see attitude. There was no large-scale trading on the street. All yarns initially showed high prices in the morning. Near noon, many sellers who needed cash tried to dispose of their holdings, and prices slightly declined at the close.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened as high as 7.12 million yuan, but eventually closed at 6.92 million yuan, still up 520,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose 550,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon squeezed up 330,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot opened at 3.48 million yuan, briefly rising to 3.50 million yuan, before briefly falling to 3.41 million yuan before the close, and finally settling at 3.44 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse finally traded at 3.31 million yuan, up 240,000 yuan. Grades of 16-count and below also showed slight gains.</p>
<p>The cloth market rose sharply and then fell quickly. Initially, it carried over the over-the-counter gains from the previous day, and everyone was bullish. Buyers absorbed eagerly, but upon hearing news of gold price declines near the close, holders became psychologically fearful and rushed to sell, causing the market to turn sharply downward. As a result, it still saw gains compared to the afternoon close of the previous day.</p>
<p>Dragon Head Fine Cloth initially opened at 162,000 yuan, briefly reaching 163,000 yuan, and then falling from that high, finally trading at 145,000 yuan, a squeeze upwards of 14,000 yuan. Five Blessings Fine Cloth rose 11,000 yuan, ending at 124,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji opened at 145,000 yuan in the morning. As many sellers took advantage of the high prices, the price gradually declined, and the afternoon close was 128,000 yuan, a final increase of 13,500 yuan. Because dyes and fuels are soaring in price, top-grade Shilin cloth and other colored cloths were raised to as high as 338,000 yuan yesterday.</p>

<p>— Da He</p>
<p>It's the weekend again, and football fans are going to the Racecourse. Although Shanghai's football scene is now divided into three camps, the foreigner's matches inside the Racecourse have a "No Loitering" sign, making it impossible for ordinary people to enter. In the South Market, Saturdays and Sundays are "holidays." So, when talking about football on the weekend, let's talk about the battles at the Racecourse.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, the match at the Racecourse starts at 1:01 PM. The Youth Cup will feature the Firefly team against the Rock team. These two teams are rising elites, young and strong, like the new waves in the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, Zhonghang will play against Zhichao. This match has potential. Looking at the records, Zhonghang won the first round 1-0. Zhichao will definitely seek revenge this time.</p>
<p>However, Zhonghang has been in high spirits recently. In the Mayor's Cup, they eliminated Qingbai 2-1, the first team to break Qingbai's long-standing winning streak in three years. This is truly the ultimate glory for Zhonghang. Although they lost in the final, any fan has the thought that "this is a chance created by Zhonghang." Therefore, although Zhichao is determined and has the will, winning the game is a big problem.</p>
<p>Zhichao relies on Wu Qixiang as the soul of the team's offense and defense, but Qixiang has recently lost interest in playing football due to some issues. His appearance in this match is a matter of concern.</p>
<p>Zhonghang's defense is not strong. In fact, inside, there is only Xu Fusheng as a reliable goalkeeper. The defense line also only has Xie Xichuan holding it together. The center defense line is even weaker. Jin Chuanhan can still be used, but the other two are not very reliable.</p>
<p>Zhichao's offense, the problem is how to breach Fusheng. If Fusheng is protected by Xie Xichuan and Jin Chuanhan, Zhichao's forwards will not have the ability to shoot from 20 yards away. Zhonghang can be as stable as Mount Tai.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhichao's attack should use both wings more. The right wing's attack should go straight down the side, luring out Xie Xichuan, and then passing into the center. The best method is of course a long pass to the left wing, but they probably don't have the skills to do so.</p>
<p>If the right wing can draw Little Xie away from the goal, there will be an opportunity to break through in the center. The left wing should cut in and shoot rather than cross, because if the cross is high, it will be difficult to get past Little Xie.</p>
<p>If Zhonghang wants to break through Zhichao's defense, the first thing is to find a way to get past Wu Qixiang, but that is quite difficult.</p>
<p>Jingwu once defeated Zhichao, and the methods they used are worth Zhonghang borrowing.</p>
<p>That method is: the center forward retreats slightly, then the wings cut in, and the two inside forwards advance together. This method is especially effective against central defenders who are good at protecting the goal. Because if the center forward retreats, if the central defender comes out, then the meaning of the third defender is lost, and the wings have the possibility of driving straight down. If the central defender is still inside, then the two inside forwards can use the attack method of interchanging positions, making it difficult for the central defender to guard them one against two.</p>
<p>In this match, Zhonghang should have Xu Zuguo play winger and Gao Xiuqing play a retreating center forward. If they can arrange the lineup this way, they can beat Zhichao again.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Qingbai will play against Longtou at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>This game should be one of the major matches, and a fierce battle is expected.</p>
<p>After Qingbai had bad luck in the Mayor's Cup, the paper tiger was exposed. Ah Fu did not come out to lead the troops, causing Qingbai's lineup to lose its attacking power. It will not be easy to win against the strong Longtou from the north.</p>
<p>In fact, to deal with Qingbai, the first thing is to pin down Little Luo. Little Luo is the root of the blood vessels and also a shooter. Among the teams in Shanghai, there is no inside forward who can compare with Little Luo. However, this is Qingbai's strength, and exposing it is also a weakness. If Little Luo is controlled, Qingbai's forwards will have little chance.</p>
<p>Jin Lusheng's darting shots are certainly formidable, but if Little Luo doesn't find gaps to open the way, it's also futile.</p>
<p>Qingbai's right-wing offense is not strong. If you keep a close eye on the left, the right will not have problems.</p>
<p>The second thing to win against Qingbai is to attack the weak points of Qingbai's defense. There is Meng Yiliang in the center. Old Meng is very skilled at guarding the goal. If you put pressure on this point, it will definitely be more effective. Sanmao's side is also extremely stable in defense. However, Xue Peiran likes to go out and assist the attack. If a fast enough inside forward partners with the left wing in time, there is also a possibility of getting past Sanmao. The left side is the weaker link in Qingbai's defense. Qian Changrong is not in good form, and Zhang Renyi is not a talented defender. There is an opportunity to take advantage of either of these two guarding the goal.</p>
<p>But Qingbai's strength is in the center defense line. Xue Peiran and Fu Naitang will both control the midfield. Longtou must gain an advantage in the midfield in order to have the ability to defeat Qingbai. Otherwise, if Peiran is allowed to bring the ball out and Little Luo can be active, Longtou's defense will be exposed.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Renyu's Last Lesson: Tonight's Battle Against the Shanghai Police. Women's Match: Li Team vs. Li Team <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The four-session basketball league's Group A1 has reached its final stage. There are five more games to be played and will be all over on April 8. The Hualian team winning the championship again is no problem. Renyu has the highest hopes of winning the second place, and the match against the Shanghai Police tonight is also quite important. Before the main event, there will be a Women's match and a Group A2 match, starting at 5:30 PM. Ticket prices have been adjusted to 1,500 yuan for the upper deck, 3,000 yuan for the lower deck, and 5,000 yuan for reserved seats. The order and referees are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Li Team - Li Team (Women's Group) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Referees: Wang Yiqiao, Zhu Mingxing</p>
<p>Mei Qixiang - Jianle (Group A2 C) 6:15 PM Referees: Wen Zongyuan, Huang Cunrui</p>
<p>Renyu - Shanghai Police (Group A1) 7:15 PM</p>
<p>Referees: Wu Zibin, Liu Hesheng</p>
<p>There are two Women's games left. Today is the re-encounter of the Li team and the Li team. The Li team has risen in this session. The women's team is getting stronger in every fight. Today, it should be able to defeat the Li team again and win the second place. The Li team has no hope of victory, and the fourth place is non-other than theirs. However, the tireless fighting spirit of the new players is worthy of commendation and they will definitely resist to the end.</p>
<p>Group A2 C, Mei Qixiang vs. Jianle, is the main battle of this group. Mei Qixiang has always won. Jianle has won every game except for losing to the Fat team. If they can defeat the Western forces in one go, they may have a chance to win the championship. However, Mei Qixiang's main player, Bo Tou, has transferred to Enkas, and their strength is still considerable. The Jianle players should be cautious and use all their wisdom to strive for victory.</p>
<p>Group A1 Renyu vs. Shanghai Police, Renyu is their last lesson. The team recently defeated Haiqing greatly, fully demonstrating their power. Xu Zhonglv, Wu Xinyun, Shen Pengju, Yao Weny, and others all have unique skills, and the team's record is nine wins and four losses, making them the highest contender for second place. If they defeat the Shanghai Police tonight, it will become an unshakeable fact and their second-place finish cannot be shaken.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Police have six wins and five losses, with three games left. Although they are not significant, they are very relevant to their ranking. If they win tonight's battle, they still have a glimmer of hope for second place, otherwise, they may not even be able to keep the third place. Therefore, the whole team must go all out and fight to the death. Moreover, the Shanghai Police had a strong momentum in the first round, but they were discouraged by Renyu's fierce attack. This time, they are seeking revenge, and the two sides are evenly matched, and a fierce battle is inevitable. The names of the six teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Li Team) Qian Chuping, Qian Youping, Zeng Zhaoqing, Zhu Cuidi, Niu Yunjuan, Yao Silian, Xu Huiru, Chen Wenyan, Cai Mingxia, Chen Yuling, Guo Yipei, Xu Muben, Jin Lili.</p>
<p>(Li Team) Weng Xiayun, Wang Jiahua, Liang Miaoling, Yao Wenda, Liang Miaozhen, Fan Yuying, Chen Shanbao, Liu Danzai, Zhang Shanfu, Zhou Younan.</p>
<p>(Mei Qixiang) Pu Bo, Lai Fudan, Mankao, Ke Linsi, Lao Xu, Kai Pu, Shi Gailai.</p>
<p>(Jianle) Chen Yong'an, Zhang Xianlun, Zhou Jun, Wang Minzhi, Yan Shilu, Chen Zuoliang, Yu Kun, Wang Zhengqing, Xuan Tong, Tian Binggang.</p>
<p>(Renyu) Chen Wei Yuan, Wu Xin Yun, Yao Wen Yi, Zhuang Yi Rong, Shen Peng Ju, Li Zhao He, Wang Huai Ting, Cai Jin Dian, Sun Guo Zheng, Xu Zhong Yi, Yan Bin.</p>
<p>(Shanghai Police) He Jingui, He Zeng, Wang Bowen, Sun Moses, Fu Qixia, Liang Rongbiao, Wang Rongsheng, Shi Wenquan, Chen Shensi.</p>

<h3 id="e98">World Table Tennis Room Opens: Exhibition Matches Full of Excitement <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The World Table Tennis Room held its opening ceremony at the fourth floor of the Great World at 3:00 PM yesterday and invited famous male and female players in the city to participate in the exhibition to add to the excitement. More than 600 spectators were present, making it a grand occasion for a time. The ceremony began with Chen Linsheng unveiling the opening and Wang Yi giving a speech. The exhibition then began, with a total of five groups playing. The battles were full of excitement, winning thunderous applause from the audience. In the first group, up-and-coming young player Wang Chuanyao faced Sun Meiying, the runner-up in the women's singles at the National Games. He was weaker and lost to her by a score of one to two. In the second group, chopper Gu Hehua defeated Qi Wenyuan in straight sets. In the third group, ball freak Zhu Qingji defeated Dong Wenshao, a strong player from Nanjing, with short blocks. In the fourth group, all-around player Liu Zaoshi had a fierce battle with popper Zhuang Kunrong. Zaoshi was agile, while Kunle was fat and tired of running. Liu won by a score of one to two. In the last group, Shanghai women's champion Cai Xiuyu faced veteran Chen Linsheng. The battle was quite intense. Cai swung her paddle and attacked fiercely, with extremely accurate angles. Old Chen always defended and did not exert his full strength. As a result, Cai won by a score of two to one.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Longtou Barely Defeats Daxia: Score Two to One. Both Sides Perform Excellently <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Longtou football team relied on their efforts in the last five minutes to narrowly defeat Daxia two to one in the Democratic Cup yesterday. Longtou's skills and strength are well known, and need no introduction. Daxia is a newly promoted youth team, and their performance yesterday was very satisfying. Goalkeeper Shen Yanguan was extraordinary, and defenders Chen Fulai and Shao Guangming were as solid as iron gates. The midfielders were also very solid and able to create attacking opportunities for the forwards. In particular, the intercepting and passing skills of the central midfielders Yu Lishen and Huang Zengxi were outstanding. However, the two wings of the forward line were relatively weak, and center forward Pang Meixiong often hesitated and missed opportunities, which was a shortcoming. However, in any case, Daxia is a team with a very good foundation. If they can reduce their dribbling, they have limitless potential.</p>
<p>In the first half, although Longtou had many attacks, Daxia's defenders and goalkeeper were able to defuse the danger one by one. After a fierce battle of three quarters of an hour, no goals were scored. After switching sides, the competition became even more intense, and the game became even more exciting. After about half an hour of stalemate, Zhang Jiliang of Longtou scored the first goal, but soon Pang Meixiong of Daxia equalized to one goal each. Longtou continued their efforts, and until three minutes before the end of the game, Jiang Kun finally shot the ball into the net in the chaos, winning the final victory by two to one. The starting lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Longtou</p>
<p>Yan Chengkuan</p>
<p>Li Chengxian Yao Qingsheng</p>
<p>Wu Kaimin Wang Baoshan Shi Da Fa</p>

<h3 id="e100">Football League Second Round: China Aviation vs. Zhi Chao - A Rematch Today <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The second round of the Division A Football League features China Aviation against Zhi Chao. The match is scheduled for 3:30 PM today at the Recreation Ground. Prior to that, at 1:15 PM, there will be a Junior Cup semi-final match between the Pan team and the Fluorescent team, vying for a spot in the final. Ticket prices have been adjusted to two tiers: $2,000 and $3,500, and will be available for sale at the Recreation Ground entrance starting at 12:30 PM. It is reported that ten teams participated in the Junior Cup. In the semi-finals, the leading Dragon Head team defeated Li Ma with a score of four to one, securing their place in the final. Furthermore, the match between the Pan team and the Fluorescent team has been postponed repeatedly and is now scheduled to take place this afternoon. Both teams possess considerable strength, leaving the outcome uncertain.</p>
<p>In the Division A League match between China Aviation and Zhi Chao, the referee will be Ni Xiaoben, with Chen Daohong and Zhang Zhiren as linesmen. In the first round, China Aviation narrowly won with a score of one to zero. Moreover, in the Mayor's Cup, although the team did not ultimately win the championship, they did defeat Qingbai Jindar in the semi-final stage, which is quite commendable. The lineup for today's match has been finalized. Xie Xichuan has been repositioned as a midfielder, with Yang Baoluo filling his previous position. The central defense line, in addition to Jin Jiabiao and Jin Chuanhan, will be strengthened by the addition of Xie, making it even more formidable. The forward line will be led by Gao Xiuqing, supported by a group of energetic young players such as Yin Qingbing, Xu Zuguo, Li Shunsheng, and Quan Simin, promising a strong offensive showing.</p>
<p>The Zhi Chao team, a newcomer this season, has had a mediocre record in the League A. However, they also eliminated the Dragon Head team in the Mayor's Cup, creating considerable momentum. Under the leadership of veteran Wu Qixiang, their ball skills are remarkably impressive, and they are sure to pose a threat to China Aviation today. However, avenging their previous defeat will likely be a difficult task. The order and list of players are as follows:</p>
<p>China Aviation</p>
<p>Xu Fusheng</p>
<p>Yang Baoluo, Fang Shansui</p>
<p>Xie Xichuan, Jin Chuanhan, Jin Jiabiao, Shang Huajun</p>
<p>Wang Guoguang, Xu Zuguo, Gao Xiuqing, Yin Qingbing, Li Shunsheng, Zheng Simin</p>
<p>Zhi Chao</p>
<p>Gan Huizhong, Zhang Delong, Sheng Peter</p>
<p>Hua Shoujiang, Lu Yide, Le Dequan</p>
<p>Wang Keren, Lü Qitang, Wu Qixiang, Zhu Chengjiu, Yu Qiaxing</p>

<h3 id="e101">Ping Pong Knowledge <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Wang Xin Jing, Edited by Chen Linsheng (4)</p>
<p>Choosing a Ping Pong Paddle: The ping pong paddle is the most important tool for playing ping pong, and the only tool. Therefore, the selection of a ping pong paddle should be given careful consideration.</p>
<p>The ping pong paddles we used as children had small, round holes about the size of yellow beans in the middle, ranging from as many as twenty or thirty to as few as a dozen. The arrangement of these holes was very inconsistent. These paddles were mostly made of cedar wood, which is lightweight but lacks elasticity. Nowadays, because the holes in the paddle are both meaningless and unsightly, they are being phased out.</p>
<p>In the past, most ping pong paddles were made of plywood because plywood is made by gluing together several thin layers of wood with the grain running in different directions, so it is less affected by the weather. Better quality ping pong paddles are made of paulownia or Philippine mahogany. These woods are softer and more elastic. Some even use cork for the handle, making the paddle very comfortable to hold. Ping pong paddles for hard balls have a rubber surface with studs on one side. The styles of paddles vary greatly. The most popular paddle in the past was oval-shaped with a flat handle; nowadays, round handles resembling hot water bottles are more common. The size, shape, and materials used for the paddle are all up to personal preference and are not restricted by ping pong rules.</p>
<p>Which type is more convenient depends on personal preference, but in my opinion, the paddle should be lightweight and elastic, and being excessively large is not beneficial.</p>
<p>Linsheng's note: Since the introduction of hard ball competitions in this city from the 35th year of the Republic, most players have switched to using rubber paddles. Wooden paddles have also been largely phased out. However, due to economic reasons, wooden paddles are still used by many primary and secondary school students.</p>
<p>(2) The History of Ping Pong in China</p>
<p>The success of any endeavor depends on continuously identifying shortcomings, gradually improving, and ultimately achieving a more perfect state.</p>
<p>Ping pong is no exception.</p>
<p>Ping pong was invented based on the principles of tennis. At the time, there were no fixed standards for the size, weight, color, or hardness of the ball. These were gradually improved until a standard was established. However, due to individual preferences, ping pong balls were broadly divided into soft balls and hard balls. Ten years ago, soft balls were popular in both China and Japan. Because international ping pong competitions now use hard balls, the Chinese ping pong community has been making great efforts to promote hard balls in the past five or six years. Unfortunately, there are too few outstanding talents. If we want to occupy a place on the world ping pong stage in the future, we must pay special attention to hard ball techniques.</p>
<p>In the past, China relied entirely on foreign countries for its ping pong balls. At that time, ping pong was not yet well-developed, and the sales of balls were limited, resulting in little loss. After China and Japan signed an agreement for international competitions in the 12th year of the Republic, ping pong became increasingly popular, and the sales of ping pong balls gradually increased. At the same time, the outflow of money also increased day by day. We are undoubtedly very pleased with the development of ping pong, but we must strive to reverse the outflow of money.</p>
<p>In the 15th year of the Republic, the China Ping Pong Company, with the aim of recovering rights and promoting ping pong, diligently researched and developed the Lianhuan brand of standard ping pong balls. Of course, to promote ping pong, we must be able to manufacture our own ping pong equipment; otherwise, promoting ping pong is tantamount to promoting sales for foreigners. The more ping pong develops, the more money will flow out. I remember a slogan in the China Ping Pong Research Association: "Play ping pong with foreign balls, good for the body, bad for the country." Upon careful consideration, this is indeed true. Therefore, the success of the China Ping Pong Company is a great contribution to the Chinese ping pong community. According to ping pong rules, the weight and circumference of a hard ball are:</p>
<p>(A) Weight: 2.40 cm to 2.53 cm;</p>
<p>(B) Circumference: 3.79 cm (1.5 inches).</p>

<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Recently, I attended a public lecture that moved me deeply.</p>
<p>The speaker started by asking a question: "Among your relatives and friends, who has died in recent years due to direct or indirect harm from the war? Please raise your hand." Indeed, some people raised their hands, but in such a large lecture hall, there were only a dozen or so hands.</p>
<p>Then, he asked the second question: "Among your relatives and friends, who has died in recent years due to tuberculosis? Please raise your hand." This time, almost 50% or more of the hands went up.</p>
<p>The topic of this lecture was "Tuberculosis Prevention." In just a few tens of minutes, it can be said that the audience was moved. The deepest impression I got was the scene of many hands raised, because it reminded me of another similar scene, which I saw in a German propaganda film during the war: countless French people gathered in a square, shouting "Heil Hitler!"</p>
<p>Although I was very skeptical, that's exactly what was shown on the screen.</p>
<p>Finally, I inadvertently found the answer in a magazine. It was after the German army occupied a large French city that they gathered the local people. An officer asked through a microphone: "Please raise your hand if you don't understand German."</p>
<p>All the hands went up, and the camera captured every single one. It was also a great scene of raising hands, but there were these differences. It can be seen that things in the world are really difficult to judge!</p>

<p>Some landlords in Paris stipulate in their leases that each tenant is allowed to hold one loud and boisterous party per month. At this party, any game, even boxing, is allowed until eight o'clock the next morning. Other tenants must not interfere. However, one day before holding the gathering, the tenant must give written notice to the landlord so that the landlord has enough time to warn other tenants to temporarily move out or make other preparations for the evening.</p>
<p>In Sweden, when housewives host grand banquets, they often make a table of the arranged seating and paste it at the entrance so that guests with poor memories can "follow the map" without being impolite to others, even if they have forgotten other guests' names after introductions.</p>
<p>When the King of Siam punished his courtiers, he often gave them a white elephant. Because Siam is known as the "Land of the White Elephant," the white elephant is regarded as sacred and inviolable. The cost of supporting it often bankrupts the courtier.</p>
<p>If Egyptian women are over forty years old, they wear a black traditional costume, and the entire head, except for a pair of eyes, is completely wrapped in a black veil.</p>

<p>— Translated by Li</p>
<p>When God created women, he did not create them from the skull of men, nor from the bones of their feet, but from their ribs. Therefore, today women are neither the masters of men nor their slaves, but have become "the ones closest to their hearts."</p>
<h3 id="e105">Black Bears of North America <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>We Chinese often say "as strong as an ox," the French like to say "as strong as a donkey," while the British and Americans prefer to say "as strong as a bear." In fact, the strength of a bear is indeed ten times greater than that of oxen and donkeys. It is said that if a bear strikes with its paw, the heads of oxen and donkeys can be smashed to pieces.</p>
<p>The forests of Alaska, Allison La, and Florida in North America are active areas for bears. Their fur is mostly black, with a few being cinnamon, coffee, or light brown. Regardless of the color, North American residents call them "black bears."</p>
<p>Black bears can weigh up to four hundred pounds and stand three feet tall. They can stand upright like humans, at which time their height is six feet. In short distances, they can travel thirty miles per hour. Speaking of their strength, they can be said to be unmatched among animals except for elephants. They can pull three hundred pounds of wood and uproot twenty-foot-tall oak trees. Once, a black bear in Florida grabbed a one hundred and fifty-pound pig with its forefoot and ran nearly a mile before abandoning its prey when farmers chased after it in groups.</p>
<p>Black bears eat everything: fruits, roots, insects, fish, and any animal they can catch. They especially like to eat honey and ants. Telephone lines are often damaged by them because they mistake the "buzzing" sound of the telephone lines for bees, so they often climb up telephone poles and tear down the wires. Speaking of the black bear's ability to climb trees, it is a skill they have trained since childhood. A cub less than three months old likes to climb low trees, and only jumps to the ground when the branch droops under its weight. Black bears are also quite clever at catching ants. They dig out ant nests, extend their forefoot, and let angry ants crawl all over it before licking it clean.</p>
<p>Every year from November to April, is the "hibernation" period for black bears. During this time, they hibernate in rock caves or large tree holes, without eating or moving, and their heart rate and breathing become particularly slow. Female bears give birth during this period, producing two or three cubs per litter, each weighing less than one pound, blind and hairless, and only able to leave the cave to play after a month of hibernation. "Hibernation" is a resting period for black bears, but it is also a period of misfortune for them, because hunters often use this time to catch them, and they have no choice but to submit.</p>
<p>Many black bears are kept in American national parks, and they are very tame. It is said that they love to have their picture taken. When tourists raise their cameras, they will pose in the most beautiful and majestic poses, allowing tourists to capture them in the lens.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Epic Poetry of the Late Ming Dynasty <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Shouwu</p>
<p>In this chaotic world, it is easiest to evoke people's thoughts of historical relics. On a cold spring night, under the flickering light of a lamp, I happened to think of Huang Chunyao, a heroic warrior of the late Ming Dynasty, and the three poems he wrote on the theme of "Wild Man."</p>
<p>Chunyao, styled Yunsheng, was from Jiading in the Ming Dynasty. He was a Jinshi graduate in the Guiwei year of Chongzhen (Guiwei is the sixteenth year of Chongzhen, when Li Zicheng captured Beijing and the emperor hanged himself). At that time, the bandits were rampant, the politics of the court were corrupt, there was famine in the world, and the people were filled with resentment. Chunyao was heartbroken by what he saw, resigned and returned to his hometown, organized a local militia, and called on the people of his hometown to prepare to protect the country and their villages. Unfortunately, the general trend was gone, and it was impossible to prop up the crumbling building with one hand. Therefore, he could only express his sorrow for the times and his feelings in poetry. The "Wild Man" poems, which have been passed down for thousands of years, are the product of this kind of emotion. The poems say:</p>
<p>The wild man sighs at the hardship of the royal army, the Qin bandits and Chu bandits are like hedgehog hairs, they attack cities and plunder the countryside, officials die, and the people north of the Yangtze River wail. Yesterday I heard that dead thieves robbed wealth and distributed it to the officers as bribes, chopped off the heads of the people and hung them on tall trees, and when dawn came, the thieves were gone.</p>
<p>The wild man sighs at the bad year, digging wells in the ponds, and the bottom of the wells are dry, locusts lead their young to cover the sky, and it is useless to squander one's family's wealth on farming. The court adds levies from time to time, and complaining to the officials only earns a shake of the head, meeting the clerks on a narrow road, soft fur coats, fast horses, demanding money.</p>
<p>The wild man sighs that there is no one in the court, and the Ming Party in the court is like fish scales, ten officials are summoned, and nine remain silent, crawling and barely accommodating themselves. Who in the court manages yin and yang, frequent solar eclipses in recent years have devastated the four seas, I want to write a letter to ask the courtiers, but I am afraid that people will rebuke me as a foolish man.</p>
<p>The original poems can be found in the "Ming Poetry Collection," selected by Shen Deqian, who commented after the poems: "The general situation of the court and the countryside is such that even if one wants not to perish, how can it be possible?" History is a ruthless mirror, and the words in the poems are still worthy of our vigilance three hundred years later.</p>

<h3 id="e107">On Cannibalism <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>In ancient times, it was customary for people to eat people. The Spring and Autumn Annals of Zuo even mentioned the phrase "eat flesh and sleep on skin," which may have been an exaggeration by Zuo Qiuming? However, there are indeed many historical records of cannibalism. Even children know about Ma Shumou eating people. After a group of loyal ministers and filial sons personally killed their enemies, they would routinely eat their flesh raw. Not only would people not say they were barbaric, but they would praise their loyalty and filial piety? It is said that even now, some savage tribes eat their parents as a sign of filial piety. In short, whether eating enemies or eating parents, eating people is always considered a form of filial piety, no wonder Lu Xun said that the entire history is just two big words: "cannibalism," but this literary advocate of hatred only knew that cannibalism was malicious, but I know that cannibalism also has good intentions. Cannibalism is detestable, but sometimes it can also be commendable.</p>
<p>There are many ways to eat people, but the most wonderful is the following record in the "Chicken Rib Compilation":</p>
<p>"In the early Tang Dynasty, the bandit Zhu Can used people as food, saying that eating drunk people was like eating pickled pork. ... And since the year of Bingwu in the Jingkang era (of the Song Dynasty), when the Jin barbarians invaded China, ... bandits, soldiers, and even residents ate each other, and the price of meat was cheaper than dogs and pigs ... old and thin men were called "burning fire," young and beautiful women were called "enviable sheep," and children were called "rotting with bones," and they were all commonly called "two-legged sheep." ..."</p>
<p>Please don't say they are cruel, they are based on scripture. Didn't the Zuo Zhuan say? "It's like birds and beasts, the ministers eat their flesh and sleep on their skin!" They are not eating people, they are eating birds and beasts!</p>
<p>I have never eaten human flesh, because I am not a loyal minister or filial son, nor am I a savage. But a retired military officer once told me that he had eaten human heart and liver. It is said that the taste is similar to pig liver; at first, he didn't know he was eating human flesh, so he ate it with relish, but after he found out, he vomited, and people scolded him for being too timid, saying that he was not worthy to eat human flesh. When I met him, he was in dire straits, and perhaps his lack of success in life was because he couldn't get used to eating human flesh?</p>
<p>Since ancient times, filial sons and daughters have cut flesh from their thighs to cure their parents' illnesses, which is an evolution of the way of eating human flesh and can be considered a national essence.</p>
<p>Cannibalism! Cannibalism! There are many patterns, and the motives are different. Some people eat people, and some people are willing to be eaten. The knights in "Han Feizi" even treat guests with their own flesh, which is even more of a heroic act.</p>
<p>Someday, when I have time, I will write a detailed article on the topic of "cannibalism," but for now, let's leave it at that.</p>
