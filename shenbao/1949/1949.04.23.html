<h3>蔣總裁由溪口抵杭　李何等昨往謁當日回京　商定加強聯繫堅決作戰　何應欽長國防部兼陸海空軍總司令</h3>
<p>〔本報寗波廿二日電〕蔣總裁廿二日晨九時由溪口抵甬，旋填櫟社機塲乘美齡號專機飛杭。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿二日電〕蔣總裁廿二日午十一時左右由溪口飛抵杭州筧橋機塲。代總統李宗仁及何應欽·白崇禧·張羣·程潛·吳忠信·徐永昌·顧祝同·湯恩伯並蘇·浙·皖各省主席等均於事前抵筧橋迎候，各要員到後均未入城。現筧橋與杭市區沿路已戒嚴，又浙主席周　廿一日晚召開緊急會議，決定成立杭州城防指揮所，廿二日起杭市緊急戒嚴，白天憲警加崗，入晚提早戒嚴一小時。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕中委張道藩廿一日晨由滬低京，代表廣州中執會分謁在京各元老，轉述中執會意見，　請黨內團結一致，擁護李代總統，主持今後作戰事宜事畢，廿二日返滬。</p>
<p>〔本報福州廿二日電〕確息：蔣總裁將於短期內蒞厦。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕行政院秘書處新聞處廿二日發表公報稱：政府為爭取全面和平，使人民獲得休養生息之機會，派遣代表團前往北平，與共黨商談停止戰事，恢復和平之辦法，經兩局有餘之折衝，迄未能達到協議，最後共黨竟提出所謂「國內和平協定」，並限期答覆，全文八條廿四款，完全為征服者對被征服者受降之處置，其目的在施用武力，以消滅國家軍隊，造成恐怖，以摧毁人民自由與社會安全秩序，一面更發動全面攻擊，強行渡江，至此，共黨毫無謀和之誠意，而甘心破壞和平，擴大戰亂，與國家人民為敵，已大白於天下，本日（廿二日）蔣總裁自溪口到杭州，李代總統及何院長由京飛杭晤見，對當前時局及政府今後之政策鄭重商討，當經一致決定四事如下：（一）關於共黨問題，政府今後惟有堅決作戰，為人民自由與國家獨立奮鬥到底。（二）在政治方面聯合全國民主自由人士，共同奮鬥。（三）在軍事方面由何院長兼國防部長，統一陸海空軍之指揮。（四）採取緊急有效步驟，以加強中國國民黨之團結及黨與政府之聯繫。</p>

<h3>白崇禧返抵漢口</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕張羣廿二日飛杭前，在機塲語記者，目前時局確極嚴重，本人決卽返川。談及赴溪口經過時，張氏稱：蔣先生決以全力支持政府。又白崇禧赴杭後，當日飛返漢。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿二日電〕白長官崇禧偕楊受瓊，於廿二日先後四時半乘飛機返低漢。</p>
<h3>首都六小時內　官員撤退一空　政府再促各使節遷穗</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕中共下令總攻擊後，首都情勢已益趨緊張嚴重，除李代總統·何院長赴杭已歸來外，其他要員多已相率離京，廿二日上午起載送立委赴穗·赴桂·赴台之專機，卽紛紛起飛，下午並有飛機多架載送政府要員離京，政府之緊急疏散工作，正加速進行，並可於一二日內完成。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿二日電〕在廿二日晨十時以後六小時內，所有官員幾將撤退一空，南京機塲上之飛機，裝載高級官員之家屬及行李，不斷起飛離京赴滬·杭·穗及其他華南城市。除李代總統及何院長外，桂系重要官員包括內長李漢魂將軍在內，乘機飛杭。李宗仁夫人及其他廣西官員之家屬則飛赴桂林，其他部長非飛滬卽飛穗，祗敎長杭立武仍留京，聞渠將在緊急時，乘美大使館飛機離京。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿二日電〕此間居民廿二日並無驚慌之象，有好奇之羣衆，晨間且聚集江邊，觀江北之砲戰。此間商業進行如常，若干商店因生意淸淡閉門，電影院照常開映，街頭銀元叮噹之聲不絕於耳，黃牛依然活躍。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司昨派飛機十五架，中央航空公司昨派飛機八架，飛京協助政府各部門緊急疏散事宜。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿二日電〕政府於一月間因首都受共軍威脅，自二月五日起遷穗辦公，並經照會各國駐華使館，請隨同遷移，當時各使館代表先後來穗，惟大部份使節及其館員均仍留京，茲因共軍重新發動攻勢，南京已成戰區，政府為策謀各國使節及其館員之安全計，特於廿二日再度通知各使館，促請儘速全部遷穗，並電我駐外各使館分別向當地政府作同樣表示。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿二日電〕此間各國外交使團廿二日接獲中國外交部之通知，勸吿彼等撤往廣州。據自可靠方面探悉：各國外交使團已決定留在南京。一般僉信此項決議乃於廿二日晨各外交使團所召開之秘密會議中所決定者。在數天前各大西洋締約國家曾舉行秘密會議，幷決定雖在共軍攻佔危機中，仍留駐此間。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕政府各院部會前經決定遷穗辦公，南京方面政院各部會設聯合辦事處，以資聯繫，惟近以中共擴大戰亂，渡江南犯，政府決將該辦事處撤銷，全部遷穗辦公。</p>
<h3>鮑靜安抵滬談　戰局雖相當沉重　尚不如想像危急</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院新聞處長鮑靜安昨午後自京抵滬。據謂：首都情形尚佳，戰局雖相當沉重，尚不如想像之危急，荻港及江陰方面情勢雖有變化，但政府仍有守江決心。南京各院部之撤退，並非遷都之謂，因根據二月五日之決定，今後政府卽在廣州辦公，而在原則上，政府自不便留在火綫上。鮑氏證實李代總統及何院長日內均將來滬，何院長且將在滬滯留數日，指示一切。整個總統府不致遷滬辦公，但總統府內若干要員，將於日內來滬。</p>
<h3>閻錫山來滬　幷城仍固守中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕太原綏署主任閻錫山廿二日下午三時乘民航機自京飛滬。閻氏在機塲語記者，太原打得很好，廿二日晨曾殲匪一萬餘人，本人到滬後，仍繼續以電話指揮太原軍事。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中共電台昨夜十時十分廣播消息：太原國軍仍與共軍繼續苦戰，外傳業已淪陷之說不確。進攻太原之共軍正副司令徐向前，周士棣及政委羅瑞卿，仍利用新華電台轉向太原續播「吿太原城內全體市民書」，勸卽放下武器，停止抵抗，可證明太原城垣至今仍在國軍苦守中。據中共方面自稱：此次進攻太原之部隊，係混合東北·華北及西北三大野戰部隊而成，攻勢至為熾烈。據謂城郊四週之據點，雖有被突破之處，但城區仍在國軍固守中。</p>
<h3>立監兩院長抵滬　于右任談時局心情沉重　到滬立委今舉行談話會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕立法院長童冠賢，監察院長于右任，財長劉攻芸及翁文灝等一行，昨日午後五時由京乘專機抵滬。于氏晚間曾接見記者，談及時局，心情頗為沉重。渠表示在滬稍留數日，卽行赴穗。于氏承認國是之和平解決已吿絕望，將來戰局之演變，因渠非軍人，難作解答。至於未來之外交關係，本為和談中之一環，截至目前為止，表面上尚看不出對政府有利之處，今日新任外長尚在歸國途中，葉次長經常在穗，渠接觸甚少，故對此不能有詳盡剖析。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕立委近日抵滬者，已達二百餘人，葉溯中，劉贊周，李鈺，楊一峯，謝澄宇等卅三委員，特聯合發起於廿三日下午三時在同孚路一八四號新生活俱樂部，舉行談話會，交換對時局意見，並商談南行問題。</p>
<p>〔又電〕監察院副院長劉哲，率監委六十餘人，曁職員十餘人，乘專機三架，於廿二日下午飛抵上海，其餘留京監委均將陸續來滬。監院已派員來滬洽訂機船坐位，俾分赴台·穗兩地。</p>
<h3>立院定五月初　在穗繼續開會</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿二日電〕京立委廿餘人廿二日抵穗，副院長劉健羣同來。據稱：立院大會將於五月初在穗繼續舉行大會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕政委朱家驊及立委等一行，廿二日上午乘專機飛穗。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿二日電〕留穗立委廿二日晨舉行座談會，出席委員八十餘人，公推徐源泉主席，首由李棟宣請對時局聲明及致慰勞前綫將士等電文，續卽開始討論，均經修正通過。幷通過組織「立法院在穗復會籌備委員會」，並推徐源泉等廿一人為籌委會幹事，積極進行復會籌備工作。</p>
<h3>豫鄂共軍積極調動</h3>
<p>〔本報橫店廿二日電〕軍息：豫南鄂東鄂中共軍仍在積極調動，增防武漢外圍國軍大部已到達指定陣地。據軍方發言人談：不管對方壓力如何強大，國軍不致輕易放棄武漢外圍之重要據點（包括黃陂孝感）。又記者今晨驅車至孝感附近國軍陣地視察時，見鐵路傍某師士兵於挖掘戰壕，工餘正協助農民在麥田菜地間刈草，華中前綫士氣與民心逈異往日，渠等於獲悉共軍發動總攻之消息後，希望顯已變為怒火。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿二日電〕長江中游江防趨緊，海軍巡洋艦兩艘，昨夜自某地駛往九江附近巡邏。又，鄂水上警察局頃又奉令將停泊江北堰船隻一律集中江南，同時漢口江邊之躉船亦須移泊武昌</p>
<h3>美駐日當局準備　派機船人力來華　美使館促京美僑撤退</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿二日電〕今日此間得悉，美國駐日本遠東方面軍事官員現凖備依照華府命令，採取任何行動，以保護在華美僑。可靠人士稱，「如果必要」，美方將從日本派飛機，船隻及人力馳往中國，保護美方利益，惟據愼重指出，此舉目今不致採行，然此間美軍領袖將隨時凖備給予必要之援助。</p>
<p>此間美方及盟方官員現正密切注視中國方面激變之大局，多數有資格觀察家均信為時不久，麥帥總部管轄之區域，將成為世界此一部份鐵幕外面僅剩之重要收訊站。</p>
<p>同時，許多日人感覺中共之大膽行動，（指砲擊長江英艦），日本共產黨將以行動響應，日共現在日本國會擁有空前強大之實力，且因亞洲赤色浪潮之澎湃而聲勢益成。如果中共進行完全統制中國，則美國在日韓及琉球羣島之前哨站，將更形重要，蓋中共控制全中國，將使共產黨到達美國在太平洋之外圍防綫邊緣。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿二日電〕美國大使館廿二日通吿南京全體美僑，立刻利用商營交通工具離京，除非彼等「迫不得已必須留此應付任何緊急局面」。大使館復警吿稱，該館不克予以緊急之保護或於緊急時從事撤僑，因原駐南京之美海軍艦隻已調赴上海，而海軍陸戰隊衛兵已减至僅足暫時保護內部安全。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕國務院發言人廿一日聲稱，該院迄未接得任何美僑在長江一帶或中國其他地點戰事中受傷之報吿。據最近統計，在華美僑計四〇二三人，政府官員現正密切注視一切可能獲得之報吿。</p>
<h3>湘面臨重要關頭　省府連日開會議　綏署頒佈臨時戒嚴令</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙廿二日電〕大局急轉，湘南面臨，和點關頭，程潛一再宣佈「避戰應變」，惟若干將領如李默庵，黃杰等，與程氏意並不一致，地方人士從事「和平」運動，正積極展開。廿一日晚省府曾有重要會談，惟無結果，廿二日繼續會商，內容仍未透露。</p>
<p>〔本報長沙廿二日電〕長沙綏署廿二日下午三時頒臨時戒嚴令，宵禁自廿二日起實行。</p>
<p>〔本報長沙廿二日電〕程潛前請湘省參議長唐伯球赴東安，敦勸唐氏日內來長，與程主席共商應變之策，必要時唐氏將出山謀湖南安定。</p>

<h3>蘇省府保安部　分移蘇州松江</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕自十二圩於廿日夜不守，瓜洲六圩放棄後，共軍對鎭江之威脅愈見增加，蘇省府及省保安司令部為此特已下令分移蘇州松江兩地辦公。</p>
<h3>總統府政院大厦　在穗郊建築完成</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿二日電〕位於穗市東郊之總統府，行政院大厦，均已建築完成，預計下月卽可遷入辦公。</p>
<h3>戰火延及大江南岸　共軍自江陰渡江向南竄犯　浦口六圩瓜洲國軍均撤離</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫廿二日電〕二十一夜，共軍在澄西利港等處自江北偷渡南來，聞澄東雙山沚蕭山等處情况不明，澄縣長魏惜言已於廿二日下午二時離澄來錫赴滬，縣府高級職員均在錫。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕據確息：江陰要塞司令戴戎光，率所部約兩個團兵力，業於廿一日夜正式投共，同時並以所有要塞砲口瞞凖停泊江中之海軍兵艦四艘，使不能攻擊，由北岸靖江沿江南渡之共軍，因此於廿一日夜卽有共軍三千餘人，於此種情勢下順利渡過長江。據廿二日晚六時消息，南竄之共軍已分成若干股，其中一股已迫近武進無錫間鐵路以北廿華里處，國軍正兜擊中。按戴氏叛變，主要原因係本身貧污，經人控吿有據，因而投共。</p>
<p>〔本報武進廿二日電〕昨夜武進北面一夜砲聲隆隆，武澄交界處桃花港口有大批共軍偷渡，被當地駐軍發覺，當予猛烈射擊，大部船隻均遭擊沉，一部約二千餘人，趁黑夜竄來南岸，分向圩塘，史墅，潢土等屬竄擾，土共亦會合接引，廿二日晨，武北一帶情形頗緊，經國軍緊急出動馳往圍剿，迄午後分別在潘墅等地俘獲二百餘，餘均遭殲滅，國軍略有損傷，現正繼續搜索中，城區秩序如常。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕浦口國軍已於廿三日黎明前全部主動撤至南岸。又，浦口東划子口，廿三日晨一時許，共軍五百餘搭船企圖強渡至下關，已被擊退。又，下關中山碼頭招商局附近已在共軍機槍射程內，國軍正還擊中。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿二日電〕又據悉：廿一日午前盛傳揚中已情况不明，和尚洲則於昨夜被共軍佔領。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕鎭江對岸之六圩橋頭堡，經三晝夜力戰後，國軍王作華部以任務達成，乃於廿二日晨十時主動撤至南岸。又，六圩以西之瓜洲橋頭堡，亦於同日晨十一時放棄，至此，浦口以東除划子口外，所有北岸橋頭堡已全部入共軍之手。</p>
<p>南京至江陰間略圖</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕鎭江以北江中世葉洲仍由國軍固守中，廿一·廿二日夜，北岸共軍第卅四軍雖不斷砲擊，企圖登陸，俱經擊退。</p>
<h3>麥帥注視我局勢　認作戰最後結果對美十分重要</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿二日電〕廿二日獲悉，麥克亞瑟元帥正密切注視中國情勢，並認為重新作戰之最後結果，對美國十分重要。麥帥認為中國問題之程度，値得美官員在擬定全球性政策時加以考慮。據悉：麥帥認為許多美國人太注重歐洲，而忽視此間同樣爆炸性之局勢，可靠方面稱，麥帥堅信，（一）中國對於美國之戰略上重要性甚大，（二）當加以正確考慮時，可想到中國對未來之美國生活方式之安定及進步有貢獻時，對美國頗有裨益。（三）美國不應否認其與中國之久長友好關係</p>

<h3>皖中渡江共軍　陷大通靑陽口　國軍加派勁旅完成袋形陣地</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕皖中長江南岸東起三山，西至銅陵，共軍所建立之南岸橋頭陣地，廿一日夜起已擴展至大通鎭以西，其陣面寬約計百六十華里，大通鎭亦已淪陷。據悉：連日來北岸共軍，利用黑夜渡至江南者已達三個軍，約七萬人，新華社廣播中所謂卅萬人，顯係　大之詞。該股共軍據今午獲悉，已竄陷靑陽口，一股且經由南陵涇縣間竄至宣城以西廿餘公里地區，國軍已加派勁旅，並完成袋形陣地，期一鼓而殲滅之。</p>

<h3>如何抑制糧價的上海</h3>
<p>最近幾十天來，物價天天在漲，幾乎漫無止境。金融當局　傾全力抽緊銀根，以抑平物價的漲風；便除了金融性的商品例如金，銀，外幣，股票等有時回跌而外，糧價的上漲卻從未小回，以上週情形而論，南市場白粳上漲二倍一成強，北市場上漲二部三成，老車麺粉上漲，亦逾二倍。本星期來，又因時局動蕩，和談幻滅，戰火再起，使糧價更大漲特漲，尤其是食米，幾陷於混亂狀態，昨日社會局規定白粳每石不得超過二百萬元，但米商因成本不够，不肯以貨物應市，場內乃陷於停頓狀態，門市竟達三百二十萬元之鉅。這數升斗小民怎不感受「白色恐怖」的威脅！民以食為天，民食問題是一切的根本，如果聽其自然上漲，不加抑制，則其後果將不堪設想。我們希望市政當局曁治安機關趕快拿出辦法來，澈底解決這個最感棘手的民食問題。</p>
<p>我們研究最近食糧價格狂漲的原因，有下列幾項：（一）產地價高，成本高過限價，如無錫·周浦等地米價每石已到二百萬元，兼之買氣很濃，貨主都存觀望的心理，因此交易難以做開。（二）共方悍然下令總攻，企圖強行渡江，戰火已自長江北岸漸移江南，因此人心浮動，爭儲米糧，無形中使得米糧的需要量大為增加，價格也隨之昂貴。（三）以前本市的食米，係向無錫·蕪湖·四川·湖南及本市附近各地採購的，但目前長江航運中斷，川·湘等地的食米，無法運滬；蕪湖的米源—巢湖流域各縣易手後，根本無法再供應本市。同時，京滬沿綫大軍雲集，無錫一帶食米的供應，自然不能如以前那樣的充裕。又本市近郊所產的食米，究竟有限，何況近來本市的駐軍驟形增加，食糧的負担亦愈形加重。（四）一般物價，都在作競賽式的上漲，糧食是必需品，所以糧價不甘落後，加之目前是青黃不接的春耕時期，到處缺乏米糧，乃形成糧價的突然上漲。</p>
<p>就上列的種種遏止因素而言，可說絕大部份是受時局人心的影響，現在要遏止糧價的上漲，第一步只有先從安定人心着手。安定人心的方法，應先將當局「儲糧三月計劃」中的儲糧，放出一部份來暫時應急，兼而平抑市價。其次，再放寬戶口配米的限度，使能適合每人每月的實際需要，只要按月工作方法供應無匱，則米價自可穩定。再次，對於疏導食糧的來源，亦很重要。在國內運輸不暢，軍糧孔亟的今天，最好能直接設法向暹邏，安南等地去採購，以作未雨綢繆之計。前天本市雖有美援米十二萬石運抵，但也只能作為短期內的供應，現在正值春荒開始，來日情形，更要艱困，故希望當局從速繼續「儲糧運動」。此外，目前當局對於食運動，亦很重要，如搭吃雜糧。或多食粥·餅等。以本市六百萬人之多，「聚沙成塔」，其能節省的食糧，一定不在少數。至於取締糧商的暴利，或限制購買的數量等，對於糧價雖不無影響，但究非治本之道。</p>
<p>我國向為「以農立國」的國家，「民以食為天」，是我國千古相傳的格語，可見歷來秉政者對於食糧問題的重視。本來人民對食糧的需求，是不可一日或缺的，因而食糧對於民生的影響，顯較任何商品更為重大。何況糧食價格的成本（人工），為了壓平物價，也不得不先行抑制糧價不合理的暴漲。唯有如此，才能安定社會的秩序。否則，當局如若聽任糧價的自然發展，勢將影響治安，而且最易動搖人心。軍事當局今日將宣佈本市入戰時狀態，對於如何抑平物價，自應採取切實易行的緊急措置。</p>
<h3>共軍砲擊英艦事件　英仍持謹慎態度　聯邦會議引為重要問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿一日專電〕此間各報日晚刊之頭條新聞，仍為英艦在長江被擊事件，但一致皆持謹慎態度，迄目前止，政府之態度及政府所採之行動，僅限於援助被難之「紫水晶」艦。外務部發言人今在記者招待會中，於記者詢及此事時拒不置評，經再三勉強，發言人始稱：英艦在中國內河航行，并無條約上之權利，但已得中國政府同意，致記者所詢英艦應知其已在戰區內是否會於事先通知共黨指揮官之問題，發言人則稱不知，但渠亦謂，英艦自去年十月以後，即經常往來於該區，共堂當然知為英艦。關於當地報紙所載北平英領館已奉論向中共當局提出抗議之消息，該發言人亦拒不證實。同時海軍部今日中午發表聲明稱：倫敦號及黑天鵝號兵艦，因敵方砲火太大，無法靠近「紫水晶」艦。但聲明內亦謂：「謹言慎行正試圖各種方法與「紫水晶」號「倫敦」號及「黑天鵝」號三艦之間之敵方部隊取得連絡，以求確保順利通過。」同一聲明內并稱：「貝爾法斯特號及君士坦士號兩艦，現亦向上海開駛，蓋該區內需要其担負任務」。但此聲明與海軍部之次一聲明相矛盾，後一聲明稱：「貝爾法斯特尚未自香港啟椗」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿一日電〕共軍砲火射擊長江中之英艦四艘，致有四十三人斃命，五十二人受傷之消息，使倫敦極為震動。外交部今日未能證實來自中國之消息，謂駐華大使施諦文，已令天津英領事對於此種「嚴重事件」向中共當局提出抗議，此間外交觀察家認為此種抗議無異在事實上承認毛澤東政府，而英國在目前對於中共不擬作此種承認，此為英國官方人士認為和江事件殊難就地解決之原因之一。</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦廿一日電〕共軍砲擊長江上游英艦事件，已為在此間召開之英聯邦總理會議引為重要問題。據與東南亞洲事務直接有關方面稱：彼等想信共軍乃故意地攻擊長江下游之英艦，其理由有二：（一）促使所有外國軍艦自長江撤退；（二）使亞洲人民獲得共產黨有足够排斥西方國家之力量。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕據接近白宮之人士談稱：杜魯門總統今日與國防當局會談時，英艦「受共軍砲火」射擊之長江事件為談話主題之一。</p>
<p>〔合眾社東京廿二日電〕英佔領軍發言人廿二日談稱：該軍在日境內之航空隊已隨時準備，如該軍接獲援救在揚子江內遭共方砲火轟擊之英軍艦之命令。該發言人強調稱：該軍迄未接獲訓令。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕此間英國有關當局對昨日某外國通訊社報導：「攻擊馬來亞叛軍之英國皇家空軍火箭戰門機，已升火待發，以對砲擊長江英艦之共軍採取可能之行動」消息，予以否認。據稱：此項報導完全不確。</p>
<h3>共軍所用之大砲　係得自日關東軍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿二日電〕此間消息靈通方面今日宣稱：共軍用以轟擊英艦之大砲，殆係得自日本關東軍。關東軍之一〇五米厘口徑大砲，備有穿甲彈及射坦克車彈，與擊中英艦者相同，其最高射程可達二萬碼。穿甲彈之重量不詳，但知其發射速度為每秒鐘二千五百呎。共軍於蘇軍擊潰關東軍後進入東北，取得其大宗彈藥配備，就此間所知，美國從未以此項軍火供給國軍。</p>
<h3>英報指共方攻擊　為「明顯的侵路」</h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦廿一日電〕保守黨之每日郵報廿一日稱：中共對長江英艦之攻擊為「明顯的侵略」。首頁社論稱：「被殺之人乃謀殺之受害者。英國必須報復并要求懲罰」。郵報稱：「中國人如何敢攻擊吾人之戰艦？」此種行動即使在數年前，亦為不可思議者，為求答案，讓吾人看新嘉坡。一九四二年新嘉坡。陷落之回聲，仍在世界殷殷作響，其影響仍為人所感到。懦弱且不欲招待其權利之國家，在此世界中有受尊敬。吾人已數次說過，強權仍為可靠之物。</p>
<h3>聯合國休息室中　談論英艦被擊事</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖廿一日電〕成功湖聯合國休息室中，今日以英艦在長江受砲擊，及中共軍復取攻勢為主要之談話資料。聯合國各界甚至英人各界表示意見，英國甚少機會將共軍砲擊案在安理會中或海牙國際法院提出，正如　日科學海峽安置水雷，厥後損及英艦案。砲擊事雖發生在南京政府所統治之區域內，但南京政府所統治之區域內，但南京政府不能負責，故接近英代表團之各界皆認為英政府將首先查明責任誰屬，如果明確係共軍開砲轟擊，則英政府似將向中共當局提出措詞嚴厲之抗議。（請參閱第四版）</p>

<p>〔本報蘭州廿二日電〕據悉：新疆物價最近慘跌，係受中蘇貿易行將開放傳說影響，迪化黃金老秤每兩五十銀元，青蛙斜布每疋僅售五銀元，南疆喀叶等地糧價尤低，每百斤僅售銀幣五角。</p>

<h3>美參議員諾蘭提議　設國會聯合委會　調查美遠東政策　杜魯門對我局勢不發表意見</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕共和黨參議員諾蘭廿一日在參院提議設立國會聯合委員會，調查美國之遠東政策。委員會由參眾兩院各派代表五人組成之，調查美國之遠東政策。委員會由參眾兩院各派代表五人組成之，調查經費以五十萬元為限。據稱：「此舉目的在使美國人民獲悉真相，并在可能範圍內糾正錯誤，以免失之太晚。甚至吾人會議之此刻，共軍正渡越長江而開入非共產區域」。諾蘭指責國務卿最近致函參院外交委員會主席康納利反對十五億援華計劃，實為背棄非共產中國。據稱：此種聲明等於拆中國國民政府之檯腳。猶憶第二次世界大戰前，美國曾以煤油與廢鐵售給日本，結果反受日本攻擊，可見國務院之外交政策，并非毫無錯誤。整個中國倘淪於共黨之手，緬甸與法屬越南乃至印度均將淪於鐵幕之後。整個亞洲大陸一旦受共軍控制，則日本極難保持自由，彼時美國若不放棄日本，唯有使日本永久在軍事與經濟上依賴美國。中國時局黯淡，余亦承認，但其黯淡程度并不較第二次大戰初期英軍受挫於鄧扣克時為甚，彼時美國倘採取敗北主義者態度，英國殆已不能支持，整個歐洲此刻殆已淪於納粹鐵蹄下矣。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿一日電〕最近成立之中國緊急委員會主席麥奇，廿一日指斥國務院發表之美國對華軍事援助數目。渠與副國務卿魏伯會談後告新聞記者稱，中國政府只開出收到美援一億〇五千四百萬元之收據。按艾契遜廿日曾稱，自勝利後之平車對華軍事為十億元。麥奇稱，「吾人相信美國有大量之單發步槍及輕配備，不適用於歐洲，此可能改變中國之局勢。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕杜魯門總統廿一日對中國局勢不願發表意見，惟據總統之新聞秘書羅斯　稱，中國內戰之發展情勢，國務院方面隨時報告總統，羅氏并稱，「外國方面各種發展，杜氏經常接有報告，惟截至現在為止，對於中國局勢并未接有特別報告」。</p>
<h3>美對華政策慘敗</h3>
<p>霍華　系報紙社評稱</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿二日廣播：霍華德系報紙社評指美國務院對華政策為「慘痛的失敗」。該社評稱：杜魯門政府對華政策倘無所隱秘，則應虛心接納參議員　蘭德要求國會全面檢討美國對華政策之提案。吾人亟應竭其所能，以挽救此危局。該社評又稱：美國對歐洲採取公開之兩黨政策，而有關亞洲問題之決策則諱莫如深，惟恐國會及民眾得悉其底蘊，此乃極權國家之作風，非美國應有之態度。</p>

<h3>艾契遜出席參席院外委會　說明美軍援計劃　需需款十四億五千萬美元　包括援助希土經費在內</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿一日電〕國務卿艾契遜今日以十四億五千萬美元軍事援外法案提交參院外委會。此十四億五千萬元數字，約佔美國軍國援助之總數，包括一九五〇財政年度對希土兩國之軍事援助。據艾氏告該委會稱，對於北大西洋協定簽字國家之軍事援將為十一億二千萬元，其中包括器材與剩餘物資之移交及自美運出之原料。其餘三億二千萬元將交付希土兩國。據外委會主席康納利宣佈，外委會將於廿八日開始討論北大西洋協定，總統在此項討論結束時，將正式提出軍事援助法案，在此以前，該委會對軍援案將暫不予以討論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕據參院外委會主席康納利稱，援助大西洋簽約國以外之希臘與土耳其等國經費，總額為三億二千萬元。菲律賓大約亦可獲得少數贈款。軍事援助計劃倘獲通過，將與美國之外交政策不能分離。外委會定下星期四討論北大西洋條約全文，該約須經參院三分之二多數通過，始能生效。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿一日電〕確定的跡象廿一日透露，美政府在本屆國會中，不擬要求對華軍事援助。此事之透露，因國務卿艾契遜向參院外委會提出對大西洋公約國軍事援助十一億三千萬元及希土軍事援助三億二千萬元之要求。此方案稱之謂「一九五〇年之全面軍事援助方案」。政府宣佈經合總署之要求時曾稱，援助希土及中國之方案將於以後提交國會。二十一日之宣佈雖顯然已無對華軍事援助，但額外之重建設援助，可能於以後提出。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿二日電〕共和黨領袖等廿二日認為關於協助武裝歐洲及其他自由國以對抗共黨侵略之十四億五千萬美元計劃，給與國會之內情迄未充份。參院共和黨領袖灌萊稱，國務卿艾契遜所給予國會者僅另一數字而已。渠主張對建議中之軍火援助計劃「完全決裂」。共和黨政策策劃入塔虎脫稱，國會之要求非單靠費用估計所能予以滿足，渠稱，在國會處理大西洋公約核准事宜以膠，必須先知軍火計劃之一切細節。</p>
<h3>英聯邦會舉行首次會議　尼赫魯出席報告　曾提出英印新關係解決方案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿二日廣播：據悉：關於印度成為獨立共和國後如何與聯邦保持聯係之問題，印度所擬解決方案包括下列數點：（一）刪除聯邦稱號前之「英國」字樣；（二）聯邦組織應富有伸縮性，以便容納共和國家；（三）聯邦機構改變以後，應廢除「自治領」之稱呼；（四）共和國不以英王為最高權威，但承認其第一公民之特殊地位；共和國得尊重有關聯邦事務之決議，但以不妨礙其國內或國外主權為原則。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿二日電〕英共和聯邦總理今日開始第一次全體會議，以開始覓取使印度繼續與英共和聯邦保持聯係之新公式。英·澳·紐·南菲·加拿大·印度·巴勒斯坦，及錫蘭等之領袖政治家，將在一星期內，處理足以使未來聯邦關係完全改觀的新問題。</p>
<p>各與會代表於今晨十一時即驅車抵達唐寗街十號相邸，出席第一次圓桌會議，在開會前一小時，艾德禮首相在內閣召集主要閣員舉行會議。此次共和聯邦總理會議，係屬秘密會議，首先由文德禮致歡迎辭，旋即請印度尼赫魯總理報告印度對於共和聯邦關係的意見，蓋其他總理均願先聆取印度之意見，然後始提出本身的意見，會議結果，將於閉幕後以公報宣佈之。出席此次會議者計有：英國艾德禮首相，克里浦斯財相，貝文外相，莫理遜副首相，加拿大外長皮爾森，駐倫敦高級專員及駐法大使，澳總理齊夫萊，駐倫敦高級專員及駐巴黎大使，紐西蘭總理費萊綏及駐倫敦高級專員，印度總理尼赫魯及駐倫敦高級專員梅農，巴勒斯坦總理艾里千及外長薩弗魚魯拉，錫蘭總理西那那亞克及駐倫敦高級專員南非總理馬朗。</p>
<h3>艾德禮與尼赫魯　密談一時半　英印關係各總理意見參差</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕艾德禮首相昨今兩日已曾與各總理個別會談，今日曾單獨與印度尼赫魯總理密談九十分鍾。各總理下榻處之旅邸亦特別為此裝置特別電話綫。本屆會議主要目的在覓取某种公式使印度與英共和聯邦之繼續合作不致損及其未來的獨立共和國地位。可能的公式已有數個，但印度及與會其他諸國均未具有成見，英王在共和聯邦中之地位，亦將為主要議題之一，若干國認為英王為共和聯邦諸國間不能或缺的聯係，但亦有若干國則認以英王為基礎的聯係，今日已非彼等所能接受，如何調和比兩派意見，為此次會議主要任務之一。今晨艾德禮首相在官邸舉行園遊會，招待各總理，午刻各總理入白金漢宮應英王英后之宴，本屆會議預定繼續約一週左右。</p>
<h3>艾德禮與邱吉爾將密商國防事務　邱吉爾下草擬一備忘錄</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿二日電〕政府與反對黨間對於國防事務之秘密會商，預期將於下月中舉行，反對党領袖邱吉爾刻正在草擬一項備忘錄，以便提交首相，其中將　陳渠本人及同僚對於英國在現狀下與日後可能趨向中武裝防衛上各种需求之意見。會談時，艾　禮大約將階國防大臣亞歷山大與陸海空軍三大臣一同出席。陪伴邱吉爾兩者或為艾登，史丹萊與薩里斯白萊勛爵。按此事三月三日即在下院中提及，當時首相在答辯中稱，邱吉爾尚未與渠約定會談日期，但渠準備在任何時間延見邱氏云。翌日，邱氏接受邀請，但會談因邱氏有美國之行而告延擱。</p>
<h3>羅雅爾辭職獲准　美陡昇繼任人選物色中　勃魯斯調任美駐法大使</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿一日電〕杜魯門總統已接受陸長羅雅爾及美國駐法大使卡佛萊之辭呈。</p>
<p>總統今日告新聞記者稱，過去一年曾任經合總署法國分署長之勃魯斯將繼任卡佛萊之缺，但羅雅爾之繼任人選則尚未確定。</p>
<p>或部在國防組織中是否將有其他更動，總統答稱，渠并不預料即將有任何重大之更動。</p>
<p>卡佛萊將返歸美國另有任用。渠自一九一一年以來向在外交界服務，自一九四四以來向任駐法大使。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕消息靈通方面相信現任助理陸長格雷將升任陸長。格氏為北卡羅里那州數種報紙之主人。接羅氏之擬辭職傳已數月，據白宮所發表來往之函件，示明羅氏於一月初即請辭職，二月杪前復申引請。四月一日羅氏再函總統謝絕挽留，四月廿一日總統始接受其請。羅氏卸任後將復操律業。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿一日電〕據羅雅士稱，渠與杜魯門總統間并無公開之衝突，但渠對總統之取消軍隊中種族歧視政策一事，始終不能融洽。最近羅氏與新任國防部長約翰遜在意見上之衝突則益見明顯。</p>
<h3>防西德計劃擱淺　美英法進行協商</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿一日電〕此間外交界人士稱，美國務院已與英法外交部開始討論於西德領袖氣絕接受英美法設立西德政府之計劃時所擬採取的步驟。三強可能向西德領袖再度發出管告，以防免設立西德政府計劃之完全擱淺。三強係於昨日德國社會民主黨領袖許馬　拒絕盟國對西德憲法之限制後開始。</p>
<h3>英國工黨秉政期間　英決不參加戰爭　工黨議員在和平大會席上致辭</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿一日電〕英國工黨議員齊呈亞克斯今日向世界和平大會致辭稱：在英國工黨地秉政期間，英國決不致參加戰爭，渠不信英國之任何政府得在今後數年內驅人民進入戰爭。</p>
<h3>蘇作家法捷也夫　抨擊大西洋公約　指美在世界建軍事基地環</h3>
<p>蘇聯首席代表名作家法捷也夫向大會致辭，謂渠不以為戰爭即將爆發，但由於西方國家的軍備競爭，戰爭已有成為事實的可能。他又說原子彈不能被視為防守的武器，它的作用在毀滅城市及手無寸鐵的平民。法氏又曰：大西洋公約顯然在將世界分裂成兩個對立的集團，此等軍事性集團形成之日，即為戰爭已進入了準備的階段，試打開世界地圖一看便知，美國已在世界各地建立軍事環，而形成對於世界和平的威脅。</p>
<h3>愛倫堡演說蘇珍惜和平　和平之聲不能加以遏止</h3>
<p>另一作家愛倫堡又在記者招待會上稱：蘇聯最喜者莫若與美國握手，以資和平共存。世界人民的和平呼聲絕不能加以遏止，我們曾以重大代價獲得和平，自當加意珍惜之。</p>
<h3>破壞和約問題　匈羅提覆牒　未能使美滿意</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿一日電〕本月初美政府曾以照會一件送至羅馬尼亞，指斥該國違反和約中有關人權之條款。美政府頃已收到一項「完全不能令人滿意」之覆文，國務院稱，匈牙利對類似照會所提出之覆文，美國亦已收到，此項覆文亦同樣未能令人滿意。美國現正等候第三巴爾干國家前德國之衛星國保加利亞之覆文。在保國提出覆文後，美政府將與其他和約國簽署國家商討更進一步之行動。美英致該三國政府之照會中，列舉破壞和約事實，并指責各該國家處心積慮，進行各項直接違反和約之措施。照會要求採取補救行動，并將此種行動通知美英。照會復稱，苟答覆認為此係一純粹內政問題，則美英將不予接受。蘇聯（和約三重要簽署國之一）既未與美英採一致行動，則苟非其他簽署國之努力失敗，否則將不致與蘇政府磋商此事。</p>
<h3>緬英申區叛軍高懸白旗請降</h3>

<h3>處置舊義屬殖民地問題　美蘇代表發生激辯　美始終反對交由聯合國託管　蘇責美英企圖利用作為基地</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖廿一日電〕聯大政委會今日辯論前義屬殖民地問題時，美蘇代表之間發生爭辯。美代表杜爾斯宣稱，美國「認為不能將非洲土地交與企圖證明共產形式之社會為唯一形式之國家」。杜氏係答覆蘇聯外次葛羅米柯之指責，即英美阻撓蘇聯所提前義屬非洲殖民地交聯合國直接託管之方案。</p>
<p>杜氏強調蘇聯亦將參加聯合國之託管，因此詢問將非洲居民之命運交與一個分裂之聯合國是否公平。杜氏指責對於義殖民地不能獲致協議，蘇聯應負責任。渠稱，一九四五年倫敦會議陷於僵局，即因蘇聯要求託治的黎波里坦尼亞「而蘇軍并未參加里比亞之解放」。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿一日電〕聯大政委會今日繼續討論義殖民地問題。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯嚴辭譴責英美之企圖分裂前義大利殖民地，交英·美·義·阿比西尼亞等國瓜分。渠謂在英國治理下之義殖民地每況愈下，英美在外長會議中力阻就義殖民地問題獲致協議，蓋英美欲利用此等土地，遂其目私的軍事戰略目的。渠謂美代表杜勒斯之言論，不啻代表美參謀部而發。英國在其治理之義殖民地內，榨取有價值之物資，置居民教育於不顯。英國統治殖民地之態度，祗須試觀印度之言論即可知一般。葛氏謂蘇聯就義殖民地提出之建議，完全基於當地居民之利益。</p>
<h3>澳對日深具戒心　新戰爭爆發後日必重披武裝　又將再來一套大東亞共榮圈</h3>
<p>〔路透社墨爾缽廿一日電〕澳洲移民部長卡威爾，今日向皇家帝國協會發表演說稱：第三次世界大戰發生時，美國或將利用英國及日本作為「航空母艦」，果爾則日本必將重披武裝，其工業亦將重建。澳洲的問題，將為誰將再度進行，解除日本武裝的任務，日本將迅速成為澳洲的勁敵，并將無疑的再來一套大東亞共榮計劃。卡氏又曰：澳洲應付另一戰爭的準備至少需十年至多需廿五年，澳洲需要有二千五百萬的人口，以發展及保持澳洲，故澳洲必須在至多廿五年內獲得如許人口。</p>
<h3>美國的戰略</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>美國又遭逢了一個困難，它對世界各國答應得太多，而事實上能夠做到的太少。美國答應了保衛全西地球，答應把物資送給別人，答應了保障別人軍事安全，現在卻不能不把這些諾言打折扣了。負責「打折扣」的人是戰時歐洲盟軍總司令艾森豪威爾將軍。他所擔任的名義，是美國國防部長的特別顧問，在聯合參謀本部舉行會議時，他擔任主席。</p>
<p>遠東局勢變化到了目前階段，美國顯已決定暫時不再向亞洲送出大量的金錢和軍隊。日本的麥帥現在已經知道，美國不預備再在日本增強軍力。「冷戰」正與第二次大戰一樣，主要的戰場是歐洲。一且「冷戰」成為「熱戰」，主要的戰場仍舊還是在歐洲的。</p>
<p>在歐洲，斯坎的那維亞國家和義大利雖然都很重要，但是在目前的估計中，卻居於次要地位。美國已經決定儘先在能夠得到最大效果的地區化錢。</p>
<p>美軍已決定置重點於大西洋，而暫時放鬆太平洋。海軍已宣佈太平洋區的十一個海軍飛機站停止活動。中國已被擱置，日本也不再依軍事觀點來加以重建。美軍在太平洋地區的主要防禦基地，今後將是沖繩島和菲律賓。</p>
<p>馬歇爾援歐計劃決定仍照以前的規模繼續執行，目的是要使這些國家在一九五二年時能夠完全自給自足，美國對西德將繼續援助，使它能夠漸漸地和歐洲其他非共產主義的國家的地位相仿。但是即使就這些計劃而論，美國在海外的負擔已經不輕。所以杜魯門總統就請求艾森豪威爾將軍協助，要擬具一個基本國防戰略。</p>
<p>美國和其它歐洲國家的國防，主要的目標當然是要阻遏蘇聯的威脅。據艾帥的看法，如果對蘇作戰，決定性的戰場是歐洲。目前，西方國家在歐洲的兵力約十五個師，其中祗有七個師能夠作戰，而蘇聯在東德一地，擁有的兵力就達五十至六十個師，而且在幾個星期之內，還可以再增加一百個師作戰。據美國軍事家的估計，雙方的兵力既如此懸殊，蘇軍實在可以在一個相當短的攻勢之後，一直打到直布羅陀。所以，他們認為，西歐國家必須建立強大的武力，才能談到安全。</p>
<p>在建立這些武力之前，先決問題是：應該建立怎樣的一種軍隊？艾帥就是來協助政府解答這些問題的。</p>
<p>當然，軍事家的看法各各不同。有人主張用原子彈，他們說，對蘇作戰應借重空戰，美軍可以使用長距離飛機，從美國一直買到蘇聯的城市和工業區去投原子彈。空軍專家說，美國新式的超級轟炸機能夠習得極高極快，足使蘇軍束手無策。但反對方面卻說，即使美國有了大量的這種新式飛機，可是轟炸員在高空投原子彈時能否命中，卻頗有問題。而且，在轟炸莫斯科和列寗格勒的時候，也許炸死的不單單是蘇聯人民，而且還有被蘇軍捉去當人質的法國人或者別的西歐國家的軍民，而且，如果蘇軍突然動手的話，也許現在駐德的美軍都會變成了這種人質，變成原子彈的犧牲者。</p>
<p>有人主張用轟炸來切斷蘇軍後方的交通綫，使前綫蘇軍孤立。可是，要切斷一千二百哩的交通綫，卻是一件相當困難的任務。軍略家認為事實上不易辦到，何況蘇方也有戰鬥機防衛呢？</p>
<p>麥克阿瑟將軍主張歐亞應視為同行重要。他以為可以把日本作為根據地，進攻西伯利亞的東部。但華府的見解卻是，美軍應集中於歐洲，而在遠東取守勢。</p>
<p>海軍主張儘量運用航空母艦，使飛機在母艦起飛，到蘇聯去投原子彈。航空母艦運用靈活，蘇軍不易防範。但主要戰場既在西歐，則航空母艦的運用袛能處於輔佐地位。</p>
<p>以上這許多見解都在縝密研究之中，在最後採取的計劃中，可能都包括一點。</p>
<p>但是，現在最主要的努力，卻是要在西歐建立一個地面部隊。新軍的配備將特別重視如何應付蘇軍著名的重坦克和大砲。專家們說，新軍應配有自動發射的反坦克槍，輔以強有力的空軍。這些配備中有許多已可在美軍剩餘物資中得到，美軍參謀部已着手整理，準備送到歐洲去。據目前的估計，第一年送到歐洲的軍火約值十二億美元左右。這些武器的大部將送至法比兩國，因為，如果蘇軍突然動手，這兩國的處境最危險。</p>
<p>軍略家正在考慮許多困擾的問題。譬如說，蘇軍如果進攻，西歐的軍隊究竟肯打到怎樣一個程度，目前就很難說。此外，如果蘇聯認為戰爭終屬不可避免，來一個先發制人，把西歐全部佔領，那麼美國送到西歐去的軍事配備就有全盤落入蘇軍之手的危險，那時美國祗好重新製造起軍火來了。</p>
<p>但是熟悉蘇聯情形的美國文官們卻認為這種危險的可能性極小。他們說，蘇聯儘管在高聲反對北大西洋公約，可是它決不會採取太極端的行動，以致挑起第三次世界大戰。（譯自「美國新聞及世界報告」原題為「如果冷戰成為熱戰，美國能夠保衛些什麼？」）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市立小學教職員聯誼會，昨日下午三時，在五區二中心召開代表大會，商討要求改善待遇問題，首由晉京請願之代表報告經過情形，政府除表示同情外，七成萬餘衛無所得。會中乃討論進行步驟，有主張總請假以行動促起政府注意，有人提議實行餓教，亦有人提議向學生家長收取補助金以維持生活。商討至六時，最後經表決於今日全體總請假一天。</p>
<p>記者昨為此事往訪教育局當局，據稱：市府陳秘書長對市立小學教職員之生活困苦，素極關懷，故在市庫萬分拮据之時，本市公務人員均未發薪，陳秘書長特向中曲銀行借款，儘先發給市小學教職員，可見其愛護教育之苦心，值此時局動蕩之日，陳秘書長對於一部份市小教職員將發動總請假之舉，至為震怒，陳秘書長并堅決表示，如市小教職員生活上有困苦之處，儘可前來陳述，當設法解決，惟總請假之舉，決不許可發生，如一校總請假，則解散一校，全市市小總請假，則解散全市市小，亦在所不惜，希在此局勢不安之時，勿輕舉妄動，共同維護地方秩序云云。</p>

<h3>舉發米店舞弊經過饒有趣味　十三歲姑娘有智慧　過眼不忘覓來物證　張經理卒被訊明起訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕崇明人張秉圭，係本市重慶中路六十號天福米店經理，以承辦戶口米有貪污舞弊情事，經該區市民章子聘，章雪雲控告，由地檢處偵查起訴，茲在地院由郭祖幹推事首次開審，旋以尚需調閱賬冊，諭知改期，該區市民多人因平日購買戶口米，屢遭該店藉口米已售罄，或以過期等語拒絕，損失頗多，故均趕來旁聽，一時庭上殊赤擁擠。據查該案舉發經過，頗饒趣味，現經記者探誌如下：去年十月二日清晨七時許，天福米店將承辦同年九月份戶口米所剩餘之三石七斗，滲入自購之秈米五石內，售與新聞路陸中和米店，當米由後門裝運時，為當地居民發覺，乃予留阻，當時驚動巡警前來干涉，該店一面與警員理論，一面篛隙即將米運走，圖滅罪證，恰　於是時有人電告盧家灣分局，警局聞訊飭人前往查詢，是時居民已散，僅一十三齡小姑娘章雪雲自願所親覩，警局人員當邀章父女往局作證，不意中途此一小姑娘忽不別而去，警員等以其父在初不置意，以為伊胆小不敢往局，迨後不久警局忽接伊來電稱：天福米店運走之米，已經由伊拘獲，囑速往運局，以作物證。緣伊年少智多，以平日往校上學，途經新閘路，曾見有米店陸中和，腦際留有印象，是晨因見天福運米蔴袋係陸中和牌號，頓憶前事，且知報警茍無物證，不能構成罪狀，故即雇三輪車趕往新閘路，因其時尚早，陸中和因未開門，而天福運米塌車運送遲緩，亦尚未到達，故一俟運到，即由伊指認，經警運局作證，由該分局巡官調得配米一杯，核與售給陸中和之米相似，至此張對私售戶口米事乃自白不諱。但張於交保回店後，次日復以同法將混合米四石運售於振興館飯店，章聞悉益痛憤，乃投地檢處申告，當派法警前往查辦，張以無可隱瞞，亦供認四石中有五斗係戶口米，唯具狀辯稱：此項戶口米係以他米掉來，銷售并不違法，地處向民調會查詢，得其覆函稱：本處配給各糧食配售店之戶口米，槪須憑證發給，并無準許另外銷售之辦法，地處據此，以張犯罪證據已極明確，不容狡賴，乃予提起公訴。</p>

<h3>公用事業計價　市府重訂辦法　水電煤氣電話收費　將按物價每日調整　公共交通票價每五天調整一次　參會公用小組今日再開會決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市府為維護本市各公用事業公司，經重訂公用事業計價辦法，（一）對於抄表部份之水電煤氣電話四項，仍用原基數，改按中央銀行發表之每日物價指數，予以調整，用戶一律照付費日指數計算收費，倘願預付者，公司應予接受，可不受預付期內價格調整之影響，惟以預付一個月用量為限。（二）對於公共交通事業，部份參照上列辦法，暫定每五天調整一次。惟交通事業與水電煤氣電話有根本不同之點，即標價愈高，乘客愈減，其收入仍不能抵付開支，故惟一補救辦法，祇有請中央銀行對於公共交通事業之貸款，就原額予以增加，以足敷各公司所需一個月之動力費（包括油煤電力等項）及薪工開支為準，并須於每月一日貨出，由各公司於月底一次本息清償。并於昨日下午四時，在市府會議室舉行緊急會議，同秘書長陳良主席，出席市參議會潘議長，公用局長張仁滔，參議員姜豪，江浩然，陳培德，瞿　，葉風虎，及本市各公用事業公司負責人辛普生，派洛克等三十餘人。</p>
<p>幣值貶落加速　公司虧耗愈甚</p>
<p>首同陳秘書長闡述開會意義稱：公用事業價格每半月調整二次，而物價則一日數漲，公司業務勢將無以為繼，必須謀妥善挽救辦法，否則一旦水電中斷，社會秩序勢將大亂，生產亦將停頓，是則不得不預謀解決辦法。繼由張局長報告市府所護議之重訂計價辦法，及各公司之經濟困難情形略稱：本市公用事業計價收費辦法，依照參議會所決定按生活指數倍數調整後，以幣值貶落日益加速，物價匯率一月數跳，致各公司三月份收入，僅佔支出之百分之三十三至五十六左右，足見各公司收支虧耗實已達萬分嚴重之程度。英同電車公司派洛克曾函公用局表示該公司以虧蝕過鉅，僅能維持至五月十五日為止，十億元，惟每日平均僅能收入一億元，至五日僅能收入十四億元之數，除請求央行予以放寬貸款尺度，以資維持外，殆無他途可循。</p>
<p>嚴重負担之下　實覺難以應付</p>
<p>嗣由潘議長致詞略稱：政府頒佈之新財政金融改革方案中，調整稅收按關元及物價指數徵收，而工人亦已要求按銀元發薪，公司方面在此兩重負担下，實萬難應付。市民之享受公用事業者，理應有合理負担，以維持各公司業務，否則一旦水電中斷，等於帮助共堂摧毀上海，故重訂計價辦法實屬刻不容緩。</p>
<p>末由參議員姜豪，瞿鋮，葉風虎等相繼發表意見，一致認為維護公用事業固屬重要，而市民生活亦須顧及，因市民之收入為金元券，而支出已以銀元為校準，如公用事業價格逐月調整後，市民實不勝負担，故認為政府應以最大力量支持公用事業，予以放寬貸款尺度，取恢復貼補政策云云。會議結果，決定於今日下午三時，再出參議會公用小組委員會加以決定後提參議會大會通過後實施之，并請央行及各公用事業公司高級負責人出席以備說明。</p>
<h3>滬西番禺路家庭慘變　生母因妬懷恨　逼令親女服毒</h3>

<p>有北平婦人費愛絲，卅七歲，畢業於國立中央高級護士職業學校，在平時曾充某醫院護士，與王精喜者結偶，育一女名青雲，今已雙十年華，初費將女託由其母撫養，伊則與王同居，嗣兩人因感情不洽，協議離異，費旋來滬，經人介紹，再嫁與本市中央印紙廠醫務主任浙江人沈人杰，育二子一女。去年六月，費將其女青雲自平接歸同居，沈見女婀娜多姿，常與接近，致為費所猜疑，不時將女毆辱。最近，費有妹名克拉瑞者，自臺灣偕　女傭姜堅貞來滬，寄宿其家，常見乃姊將女毆辱，勸女暫離，原定於即日由費妹送往青島幼妹處。昨晨九時，費妹外出購買船票之前，深恐發生意外，囑女傭姜賢隨時留意，不圖九時半後，費愛絲竟起毒心，召其女人家，將門緊閉，出黑色藥水一杯，囑女飲服，再取白色藥水一杯，又囑女服下，女哀求乞免，費母不允，方掙扎間，為女傭姜賢貞所聞，從窗隙窺悉底蘊，急報法曹警局，由股長石介人飭股員朱允章，幹員李宗蘭，陳憲忠等馳往，費女已昏迷不省，急將其飛送紅十字會第一醫院救治，并將其母拘留，廉得其情，現正由該局繼續偵查中。</p>
<h3>巡佐警員受賄案　更審僅一人到庭</h3>

<h3>安慶去來</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>偹戰謀和　吳中堅</p>
<p>彭澤是座山城水鄕的小縣城，晉時</p>
<p>五柳先生</p>
<p>曾主縣令，所以現在還有五柳鄕，五柳堂，諸種紀念陶淵明的古蹟。假若不是這次安慶之戰，外地人士，恐怕很少有機會進入此城，因為它雖臨江濱，來往滬漢的輪船，都不在此停泊，就是汽車在這兒亦不是幹綫的站口，不過航行經過彭澤的人們，為了獨峙有江心的小孤山，倒被人引為勝蹟，所以名震一時的五柳先生故里—彭澤卻被人忘懷。</p>
<p>這兒最近因為戰時關係，原有的居民，大多遷徙，剩下來的升斗小民，全城亦不到三千人。僅有的一家菜館，為了應付過往軍人的飲食，頗形熱鬧，但是，初來的人們，在這兒想找家飯店，搭個小舖，有如登天，因為全城沒一家旅社飯店，接住客人，老總們在這兒唯一的辦法，是和老百姓打成一片，沒辦法。記者這回來去彭澤，就為了住宿問題，苦苦地與菜館老閻商酌，纔得有一楊之命，一床破爛而寄生着蝨子的爛棉絮，租用一夜，要的是五角光洋，或是一百五十個銅元（俗稱銅鈔）。—一塊光洋可換銅元三百枚，金圓券在這兒是種多餘的貨幣。</p>
<p>小孤山，又名小姑山，在彭澤下游約八華里的江心，地境屬皖省望江，記者這次於安慶歸來。</p>
<p>道經彭澤時，因駐軍師長張勳亭與參謀長董子良氏堅留一日，曾於十五日偕董參長登小孤山巔，以嘗夙願，正是我們用望遠鏡探視江北遠景，忽於山麓三華里的劉家排，上花園等地，發現有共軍警戒部隊，當由山上守軍布營的一個排長肩着「六〇」砲，擺在「小姑」的梳妝亭旁，轟的一砲，二砲，…打過江去，迄無情況，稍等一時，前方的便衣報告，在劉家排等地，確有共軍五百餘人，隱藏在莊子裏，企圖西去。</p>
<p>彭澤，國防部劃定為民眾組訓的示範縣，目前在彭澤的民眾組訓工作，因逼近前綫，軍差供應，人民生活艱困而不安，一切的組訓，都不能按照預定計劃進行，何況現在的彭澤，由於軍事，政治的管轄指揮系統的複雜—政治原屬第十六綏靖區，軍事，現屬第四兵團，交通運輸，屬第八綏靖區，縣長頭上的上司，除了這三個軍事機關，還有它的直屬上司，—省政府，專員公署與全省保安司令部。</p>
<p>另外的一個嚴重問題，或許這亦不完全是彭澤的問題，就是，</p>
<p>駐軍副食費的差額籌補，以一個窮困到絕境的彭澤，要供應一個師的副食差額，與主食撥借，實在是負担不起，何況，除此以外，還要許許多多公私難免的供應。</p>
<p>大渡口，是到安慶去的「跳板」，在平時這兒不過是一個渡河的小集鎮，現在卻成為一所繁華的小街子，有旅館，菜館和西裝先生等等，他們有的來自後方，有的從前綫歸來，汽車司機是這兒最驕傲的一個，從彭澤來，非它不可，到後方去，更非此君莫屬。一條「黃魚」拖到彭澤，要四塊光洋，頂少亦得二塊。</p>
<p>這兒的物價較彭澤高一倍，一間小房子，一宿索價一塊光洋，一菜一湯的客飯，是五角，若是在下午五時以前，不能順利地到達安慶去，稍晚就連住的一宿，亦大成問題。</p>
<p>九日外民傅大渡口被</p>
<p>共軍飛機一度實行轟炸，記者這次特別的訪問幾位在這兒工作的朋友，他們承認那天在大渡口真的落了一枚炸彈，傷十二人，但無死亡，至於飛機的標識，因係高空飛行，無法判別，據當日前方報告，在安慶東郊棋盤山，有六架飛機編隊飛行，在前綫配合守軍作戰，適有口口師副團長口口偕安慶城內新民等報記者三人在棋盤山視察陣地，忽中一飛機炸彈受傷，同行三人，亦受微傷，不一會大渡口亦傳中彈，事後經向南京查詢，乃悉係亦機在一架飛機的彈夾發生故障，而被投下，所以，外傳共軍飛機轟炸大渡口的一個謎，由此揭穿！據守軍師長吳中堅談，安慶前綫，迄未發現有共軍飛機配合作戰情事。</p>
<p>共軍七次總攻下的安慶，國軍陣地，穩如泰山，是奇蹟，這是軍愛民，民擁軍的成就。所謂「奇蹟」，是守軍以</p>
<p>劣勢兵力戰勝了五倍以上兵力的共軍，將安慶下面共軍等十一軍和一個獨立師與基幹團，獨立旅打垮，而且獲得二十與一的傷亡比率，國軍反佔了優勝，這種「奇蹟」的獲得，當然由於軍民協調，與陸海空配合作戰。</p>
<p>安慶城內馬路上的地攤，反映着人民的戰爭生活，他們在砲火喧天下，仍然安靜在過他們的日子。</p>
<p>懷寗（即安慶）縣長錢鎮東原係縣參會議長，他接事的前夕，尚不知有這末一回事。在三月廿三日晚，省府撤退，前任縣長曾某受不起戰爭的威脅，連人帶印，跑到大渡口，正是一個混亂緊張的局面，由副縣長胡夢松代表交印，所以錢縣長胆敢肩負起這個責任責任，真可算</p>
<p>見危受命他說：安慶人在今日還能說不幹嗎？</p>
<p>國立「安大」，因為校址在城東郊逼近戰場，已形停頓，全校員生八百餘人，大部份離開安慶，現仍滯留在城內者，尚有二百餘人，他們的生活，書，固然讀不成，一日兩頓飯亦許馬上成問題，因為楊亮功校長，早已去京，在此驟變下，有何辦法，能够使他在遠遠的南京，拯出這批深陷在砲火的員生，所以，教職員組成一個校務維持會，學生組成應變會，他們為了生活，亦在街頭擺地攤，將各人僅有的幾本爛書破裳，擺在專員公園前面的曠地上，任人選擇，這是教育界的不幸，亦是給當地政府的一個諷刺。</p>
<p>城內中等以上學校有的他遷，有的仍在上課，小學亦有一部份在上課，難能可貴。</p>
<p>受人敬佩的是城內幾家報社，雖然在苦戰廿餘日的砲火下，現在尚有晚報，新民報，新民鐸報三家，繼續出版，因為每晚在八時以後街上戒嚴，不準通行，所以他們改出午報，編輯部除電務部份，仍按時抄收廣播外，經編兩部的人員，都是每日上午開始工作，不斷將前方戰報，萬民關懷的和談消息與國家大事，照常使安慶前綫的軍民，得到正確的報導，他們的出版，對於鼓勵士氣，安定民心，收到相當的成效。可惜每家報紙的發行範圍，僅能限於在城內及大渡口一個小小的圈子裏，三家的總發行，亦不過千份左右，過去九江的型報，在安慶，望江，宿松，太湖，…是一個大的銷場，現在亦因為戰爭隔斷了，記者這回到安慶去，型報發行人胡時覺兄，特託携帶當日報紙一百份，分贈城內守軍與皖民，以表慰問之意。</p>
<p>安慶城內現有人口，據縣府調查，尚有七萬，較諸此次守備戰未發動前，約減少二萬到三萬，但是，加上一個師與配屬部隊的守軍，外縣滯留的難民，城內人口總數，比較三月廿三日以前，或許不會減少得太多。但是，目前的問題，就是這幾萬人每日生活所必需的糧食與油類的供給，電廠每晚的放電，不但未減少，反而增加，因為城郊守軍陣地上，能够有一部份，得到電光的普照，它除供應城內用戶外，環城新裝的路燈，每晚通宵高照，但是，電廠的燃料供應，卻成了問題，最近曾由守軍商錯招商局的一批存油，以供所需。</p>
<p>記者，這回到安慶，來回一週的旅途生活，雖然遭遇到許多困難，但是，看到安慶的守軍英勇的作戰與城內人民生活的安定，深深的給了記者以一個堅強的信念。</p>

<h3>奉化雜綴</h3>
<p>— 本報記者通訊員　李鴻聲</p>
<p>〔本報奉化廿一日訊〕本縣舊行政區域，係寗波府屬六邑之一，居民語言，均為寗波語而稍變音，與毗鄰寗海邊境的鄕鎮居民，其言語則近臺屬音。但民性剛直，生活儉僕，旁山者採樵，濱海者漁鹽，而鮮長袖善舞之大賈。婚喪禮節，尚遵古制，記鬼神，信佛道，在民間仍多流行，一般人民習性剛直，均能勤勞工作，對地方公益事業，尚稱踴躍熱心。日食三餐為常，惟農家夏秋二季，別增一餐點心，縣之西南人民，以食雜糧玨蜀黍與麥為多，住以瓦屋為主，一般係一戶一間，平民黎明即起，既昏便息，大部尚無惡嗜。賭風不弱於他縣，現當局正嚴加禁緝。</p>
<p>婚喪</p>
<p>近年來，因遭受戰亂之餘，大家庭形式日漸減少，而小家庭的女子，均須負擔家政，因女子教育不甚發達，而服務社會亦屬鮮見。交際慣例，均藉婚嫁壽誕喪葬而行之者為多，平時則惟季節饋增，人民對宗教以信仰佛教為最多，耶穌教次之，迷信行動的迎神賽會等，現憶絕無僅有而寺廟僧道之水陸道場打七打醮拜梁皇等，雖尚未絕跡，於鄕間亦日趨式微了。公共娛樂場所，有縣立中正圖書館，民眾教育館，中山公園，中正公園，及公共體育場等。人民婚嫁以家庭貧富為轉移以達門當戶對，富者較早，貧者較遲，通常男子二十歲而婚娶，女子十八歲而出嫁，童養媳與典妻陋習，已日見減少。惟近因經濟衰落，及謀生關係，逐漸有晚婚趨向。婚嫁儀式，中等以上人家，頗事繁奢，粧奩以農厚為尚。挽媒妁說合有「下定」「過書」等舊禮節，城鎮或遵新式，目今因物價高漲，婚儀簡化者日眾。喪葬儀式，亦頗繁縟，有「發訃」「大殮」，「公奠」，「出殯」等程序，棺木富者亦頗為講究，且往往擇地造墳，經年累月而葬。貧者則以薄棺尚有難色，浮厝尚不多見。</p>
<p>教育</p>
<p>本縣自廿九年起奉令推行國民教育，遵照省教育廳核定數額，將原有的區立小學十八所，改為鄕鎮中心學校，并將各保成績較優的初級小學一〇一所，改為保國民學校，推行伊始，雖未臻完善，經逐步改進，規模已具，迨至縣城淪陷，多被摧毀，乃至三十一年起地方秩序稍可安定，當局即竭力加以整頓，先將停辦各校重圖恢復，并盡量充裕其學額，未設學校的鄕（鎮）保，盡量使其新設，一面推進陷區設置教育中心機構，負責聯絡教育界同志，剷除奴化教育，各校校務及設施，均遵照部省頒各項標準及法規加強視導工作，提高教師待遇，充裕鄕（鎮）保國民學校經費，督促各級國民學校實施民教工作，自抗戰勝利縣治光復以後，經當局積極整理以來，現在初等教育計有中心國民學校及保國民學校二八五折中等教育有武嶺學校縣立中學縣立簡易師範學校及私立忠義初級中學四所，社會教育有縣立中正圖書館民眾教育館及公共體育場等等。</p>
<p>經濟</p>
<p>本縣為一農業縣份，多數人民以農為業，所有農作物，除稻麥蔬菜外，即為縣南的甘潤·萬竹·鎮亭三鄕出產之竹木柴炭及進化鄕的水蜜桃等，運銷滬甬各地，頗負盛名·海產中以梧山鄕桐照棲鳳地臨象山港的黃魚鯊魚饅鮝等數量亦頗可觀，每年當自陰曆三月廿五·六大部漁民下海捕魚，至六月下旬回洋，漁業收益甚鉅，人民賴以維持生計。現因物價飛漲，以致入不敷出，經濟頗感枯竭。</p>

<h3>宜興教育新談</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員朱向高</p>
<p>〔本報宜興廿日訊〕每個在宜興留過足跡的異鄕人，對宜興的一般文化與準都一致公認較其他省縣發達，提高文化與智識的原動力，便是教育普及的原故，蘇省洪教廳長便曾對記者說過「全國教育江蘇第一，江蘇教育，宜興第一」的豪語，這確是他憑了教育理論及視察各縣教育事業後所得的結論，他辦教育的方針乃決定了以掃除文盲，普及教育為入手，并擬具失去基教示範區以計劃以促使文化進步，確為的見，最近周景玉縣長作就任後第一次赴各區鄕鎮民間巡視歸來，見了記者第一句便說宜興教育辦得較任何事業有成績，誠為名不虛傳，記者為明瞭真相，特訊問了本縣教育當局，調查辦理教育一般槪況，深覺本縣教育的裏子仍實陷於艱難困苦的深淵，唯得仰賴執行教育人員能識大體，乃由堅忍努力之後所得之成就，曷以撰成是文，藉供各地教育人士借鏡。</p>
<p>說實話，宜興教育的成績，喻諸京·滬·杭諸大都市，仍差之甚遠，唯在一般省且以而言，則確有高人一等之處，按宜興總面積二百六十萬畝的區域，學生總數即有五五六七九人，平均每在一方畝的地面上，即擁有學生四十七人弱，約佔總人口千分之八十八強，假使我們除了婦孺老年及職業人員計算，即有百分之八十的人口是在受教育的學生，內小學部門有四八二〇六人，平均學齡約自六歲至十五歲，中學部門有學生七四七三人，平均約自十三歲至七鬥賋左右，總計學校有五四〇所，每一大的鄕鎮有二所至三所中學，刻全縣計十七所，小學計五二三所，每聚居十數人家的小村子內即有保校一所，大的鄕鎮最多能擁有六所中心民校之多，設備雖未能盡合人意，然按大體說來，質量均能平均發展，即使列入世界文明諸國，也不失為一個教育很普及的縣份。</p>
<p>本縣國民教育師資水準，歷來頗高，迨自抗戰八年之中，管理乏人，以致非常紊亂，迄自復員，縣教育局即以整飭師資列為中心工作，在民國三十六年，委托縣立中學兼辦一年制簡易師範科，調訓現有教師，嚴格甄別執教是否合格，強近重加訓練，全部教師均由教局考試及格，統籌分發，一年內即完成此項工作，被被淘汰教師竟有一半以上，當即感到師資異常缺乏，於上年秋間開始單獨設立縣立簡易師範，以專門造就師資，現除校長湯維周外計教員九人，內分一年制一班，四年制二班，現有學生一六一人，乃以該校主持人均富教育經驗，辦理頗見成效，每期畢業生均中教育局統籌分發，據蔣文杰局長估計兩年以後本縣師資可調整完成，逐漸步上水準以上。</p>
<p>現有中學教師計四五〇人，小教一六四一人，低級中女性尤佔到十分之四左右，平均待遇自七石至八斗白米，待遇高者僅高級中學內小數的技術專門教員，五分之三的教師，仍被困頓于生活絕境之中，唯一原因，便為且縣費竭蹶，被列簾教費僅敷五百人之名額，與實際須用相距至巨，唯以地方人仕視祖先遺留下來的禮義文化，視之甚重，每個居民稍多的村子裏，便有大戶捐獻，興學的盛舉，輸出數目愈大的人，則他的子弟得有免費的優待，故名義雖由教局管制，什九都仰給于地方捐獻的校產支持，鄕　的名義無形消滅，并造成現在的欣欣向榮儘管不是過份寫意的職業愈是受地方重視，例如簡師第一期招收名額僅九十名而報名應考的竟有一千二百名以上，他明知將要掙扎不上生活的邊緣，但是他識大體，認清時代，任何艱苦的情形下，仍見他們咬緊牙齒，決不因特質沒有合諸理想而對自己的職責有所疏忽或灰心，輕易決不肯有請願，罷都的情事發生，再加上學風的淳厚，即使是出身微寒的農家子弟，也極知道專心讀書，尊敬師長，外面都市中「學潮」儘管鬧得震天價響，卻并沒有感染及本縣分毫，復興後社會教育一片動蕩不安而本縣學界卻一直是在平隱狀態下弦歌不輟，是他縣不可多見的現象。</p>
<p>這裏我們再談到蘇教廳一再昭告的推行基本教育未範區，按精密統計本縣文盲仍佔有全縣總人口百分之五十二弱，故該項方案之設置，更有積極推動之必要，縣教育局自擬就工作大綱及實施辦法呈示核準後，在本月一日起即行實現，唯因即須龐大經費，又須很多人力，故只能就義與，和橋兩鎮先行試辦示範區，在一定期間完成後，逐漸設法展開，再擇定第二適當地區以原有人員繼續執行。</p>
<p>辦理地方事業成功，教育第一，不久的學生，就是現在國家社會的治理人，我們還能輕視教育嗎！</p>

<h3>黔鹽緊急運銷方案</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉夢痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽四月十六日航訊〕食鹽在貴州，就民生日用品來說，任何那一件都沒有它寳貴。谷正倫主席從去年十一月起，為了它日夕操心，盡一切力量來謀澈底解決，川康鹽務管理局局長鈕建霞，最近特地由自流井應邀來黔，趁省參議會舉行一屆七次大會的機會，由省府，鹽局，民意機關共同研討，以期能够獲得一個切實有效的解決辦法。</p>
<p>紐局長初到貴陽的時候，曾企圖把他所携帶的「黔省食鹽運銷改進方案」十條作為討論藍本，那方案，他把各級鹽務機關的責任推得乾乾凈凈，并且還留下許多讓運銷商與鹽局人員可能有共同勾結舞弊營私的漏洞，在省參議會舉行的第一次鹽務座談會上，鈕局長成了一千一百萬貴州人吃不到食鹽的出氣對象，當天的局面，真使他難堪。</p>
<p>接着，一連舉行了四五次座談會，終於綜合各方意見，由省參會鹽務議會執筆，另行擬訂了「黔鹽臨時急運銷方案提要」十三條，并獲全體參議員在大會中一致通過，送請省政府實施，今後鹽局方面倘能認真推行，省府和民意機關，切實監督，則貴州一千一百萬人民當不致有貴食淡食之虞。</p>
<p>方案內容嚴密規定：（一）黔省食鹽所需數額為十四萬三千市担，這是以全省人口每人每月食鹽一市斤加上常平鹽數額所決定的，計川鹽十一萬市担，粵鹽三萬市担，滇鹽三千市担打破舊有的不合符實況的銷案制度，讓黔省東南西北的人民都能就近獲得食鹽的運銷方便。（二）川鹽由場至岸口一段，由川康鹽局全權負責運濟，粵滇鹽仍照向例，準由散商自由購運回黔供銷，避免黔西南及東南各縣非貴食川鹽不可的弊端。（三）川鹽運達岸口，任何商人均可申請購運入黔境內，自行銷售，至所征稅率，仍照百分之十從從征稅計繳，使過去少數運銷商與鹽局勾通壟斷製造黑市的毛病為之剔除。（四）為使岸價合理，及黔民明瞭實際起見，貴州省政府與貴州省參議會，應會同派員赴岸核價。（五）為免運道艱困之各岸無鹽濟銷及鼓勵商人購運計，川康鹽局盡量洽商國家銀行予以輕息貸款，以資扶持，因為黔東北烏江流域各縣灘高水急，運輸艱困，恐怕運商不樂意冒險犯難，那一帶人民可能貴食淡食，所以特別鼓勵運銷。（六）卅七年度舊運商已抵岸口之鹽。及由場至岸途中之鹽，仍由鹽商負責內運至各據點，繳稅後自由行銷，以免脫節。如運商無力內運，準在岸口成在途，由川康局按核價售與黔省散商。運商應將按口放銷與計價差數，提收歸公，倘須在尚途售鹽養運，并得報準後在途自售。（七）奮運商已運抵內岸據點之鹽，自本辦法實行後，準各商繳清稅款，自由行銷。（八）本辦法實行後，原定憑證購鹽及限銷辦法，同時取銷。（九）黔省應鹽務機關，此後應在岸口運鹽，及加強常平鹽存量為中心工作。（十）黔省各縣運銷商人，所購鹽縣，以免鹽荒。（十一）各據點常平鹽，除鹽務機關所在地之公教人員學校團體及軍隊食鹽，按每人每月食鹽一斤，開具員工名冊，就食售給外，平時不予發售，如遇缺鹽，始得發售，但仍以委託零銷為限，其售價并按重量成本核定。（十二）本方案至遲於卅八年六月底，應即廢止，但如辦理確有成效，經鹽務機關及貴州省政府商定同意後，可予延長。（十三）卅八年一至三月應配鹽額，應即於短期內，趕運到達指定地點。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日美鈔場外，初次垮臺，開始回風，因銀根緊勢逼人，業內一片缺單，各方紛紛出籠，有供無求，一路下游，晨開五三萬，五六萬，低至四一萬，四四萬，午後四三萬，四六萬。午後隔日交易沉寂，當日頭寸，散戶僅喊四十萬，有殺出，較上日狂落十五萬。</p>
<h3>銀元回小</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元套匯，做開不多，故以當地銀元折合金圓結價，各方有十餘萬成交。馬路交易初平繼落，晨開大頭仍喊四五萬，四八萬，瀕午因外埠南京·杭州·有大量倒流入滬，更以銀根猛緊，金價疲落，供多求少，幾成一片賣出聲，午後大頭跌進四關，小至三九萬，四三萬。小頭低至二九萬，三三萬，鷹龍洋亦降至二三萬，二六萬。本票交易，大頭僅喊四五萬，四八萬，一致較上日回小四萬。</p>
<h3>銀根緊俏異常</h3>
<p>昨晨本市銀根，因受昨日央行大量拋金影響，走勢緊俐異常，各業日拆利息，晨起在四〇〇元做開，十時許，各業市場一片報跌聲傳出後，走勢稍平，退至三五〇元左右，各業市場利息，平均亦在三〇〇至四〇〇元間做開，證交場外貼息，因到處一片賣出聲，故僅開一一五元一二五元，國行電貼一利息，昨起提高至六三元三角三分，日拆利息提高至五一元二角。</p>
<h3>外股漲勢稍</h3>
<p>外股市勢於華股不振，況銀根緊無比，漲勢已見稍　。昨日各股起盤頭，怡紗四十七萬進，四十九萬元出。較上日軋小一萬元·英聯五十六萬元進，五十九萬元出，較上日微升一萬元·怡啤八萬五千元進，九萬五千元出，較上日軋跌五千元·銅業公司，八萬五千元進，九萬元出，中國紙版十萬元進，十一萬元出，均與上日軋平·亞洲下挫五千元，做五萬元進，五萬五千元出，業廣及會德豐昨日均無成交。</p>
<h3>黃金公債</h3>
<p>前市初做五八〇萬元，即升至六〇〇萬元，如是盤旋二次，自見六〇〇元，又落至五七〇元，最後為六〇〇元，比上日升廿四元。</p>
<p>後市初做五八〇萬元，一見六〇〇萬元，最後為五五〇萬元，比千降五〇萬元，比上日微落二十六萬元。</p>
<h3>棉紗盤旋退縮　布市展開跌風</h3>
<p>棉紗問跌，良以時局動蕩，各方皆具戒心，昨日市勢先倘終疲，中途上落達二成。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳初以一四五〇〇萬高檔開出，嗣以新買觀望不前，去化不暢，價乃步降至一二〇〇〇萬結束，軋跌五〇〇萬。</p>
<p>三二支銀月由一一〇〇〇萬疾退至九〇〇〇萬站定，終挫三〇〇萬。</p>
<p>一二支雙馬現貨自八八〇〇萬開出後，即一路猛降至七一〇〇萬，最後略回上至七二〇〇萬，較前小四〇〇萬。二〇支各檔一致迫入七〇〇〇萬關內，一六支反露秀色，光明與天女各挺一五〇萬至二〇〇萬，餘紗俱見疲憊。</p>
<p>布市因時局緊張，兼以銀根奇緊，人心咸告虛軟，客帮無意染指，同業了結殊繁，各布展開跌風。</p>
<p>龍頭細布初開二七四萬，一度微倘至二七門萬，近午傳黃金慘瀉至二〇〇〇〇萬，且市折高做四十元，市乃急轉直下，終以二三五萬午收，較隔日晚收猛挫六十二萬。但收後斬售未已，市面仍見做小。</p>
<p>四君子嗶嘰初以二六萬開出，自高見二七五萬後，終以勢難力敵，乃退至二三二萬結局，軋跌六十四萬，收後再低至二二八萬，後市執戶成本關係，初開即見喊高，龍頭細布及君子嗶嘰，各在三〇〇萬關口做開，最後又告軟化，晚收鬆落至二七八萬上下。</p>
<h3>生絲昨未做開　人絲綢貨質仍漲</h3>
<p>生絲昨晨開優級另担喊價一三〇〇〇萬元，惟因戰氣囂張，人心虛怯，散戶觀望，雖有吸胃，但祇喊一一五〇〇萬元，致未成交，迄午仍無交易。</p>
<p>人絲昨晨開天橋即期為六四〇〇萬元，未有成交，旋即以六〇〇〇萬元做開，良以人心忐忑，脫貨求現者多，致市勢步趨下游，午收以五七五〇萬元收市，今票交易開為七八〇〇萬元，最高至八一〇〇萬元，俄而圈內外銀根奇緊，價又回小至七九〇〇萬元，較前市升八百萬元。</p>
<p>綢緞昨華強被面，初開即漲停，至三三六九六〇〇〇元收市，收後場外交易，由四八〇〇萬元喊出，旋以四五〇〇萬元成交，最後低至四三五〇萬元，較前午軋升二百五十萬元。</p>
<h3>捲煙市況欲振乏力　皂燭火柴步趨俏途</h3>
<p>捲煙昨日市面趨勢欲振乏力，市拆高昂，千元拆至少三百元，浮多不堪負担，市面实销呆滞，市上售多於供，走势退削。</p>
<p>皂烟火柴因係市面日常必需品，故各方吸纳畅旺，昨日狂涨四成以上，计白锡包二八〇，〇〇〇元，三砲台二二五，〇〇〇元，十支大英二八五，〇〇〇元，二十支大英一一五，〇〇〇元，十支老刀二六〇，〇〇〇元，大美麗一六五，〇〇〇元，金鼠八〇，〇〇〇元，銀行一二七，〇〇〇元，雙斧五八，〇〇〇元，白蘭地一一三，〇〇〇元，大克來斯一〇八，〇〇〇元，標準五二，〇〇〇元，聽裝茄力克四六萬，三五牌三門鎖，克來文二八萬，黃金架二四萬，水手二五萬，固本皂三四〇萬，剪刀皂三一〇萬，黃祥茂二四〇萬，美麗火柴一五〇〇萬，鳳凰火柴一四〇〇萬。</p>
<h3>茶市趨勢尚定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃紡茶業某鉅子，據告：幣值如此貶落，產區茶農，為不使虧蝕起見，早已按黃金，銀元，寳物等，相互交換，而迄最近，本市同業授受，相率仿效，是以折合金圓，茶價日見新高，造成不可遏止之勢。</p>
<p>昨市則在金融性各物，迂廻低落中，茶市趨勢初尚穩定，迨後終呈不支，跟隨而下，惟買戶依然長高，同時銀根空前緊俏，遂仍躑躅不前，交易欲振無力。</p>
<p>又稱：我國主要出口貨之茶葉，自勝利迄今，初因外匯關係，兼受錫關，爪哇，日本等茶，廉價兌銷之影響，已瀕千鈞一髪之際，而目前復又時局動蕩，及種種關係，不啻將茶葉推入漩渦，前途殊多渺茫。</p>
<h3>銀根緊暗息高　華股初疲後平</h3>
<p>由於和平談判已告破裂，中共方面下令全面攻擊，華股數日之漲風高潮，昨日已告一段落。況央行今日有巨額款項差進，故市間銀根奇緊，暗息高昂異常，日拆每千元三四百元左右，業中人心多方顧忌，買意毫無，浮空乘面出手，一路高　，故各股除臺糖始終站立漲停板外，其他各熱鬧，皆較上日軋小</p>
<p>記紗開高盤一八五元，浮多乘面居高湧出，市勢乃見下退，新賣不願落後，亦見一致賣出，故開後市勢幾為賣風籠罩，幸「巨戶」十三號出手扳持，市勢稍見平穩，惟仍現搖欲墜之態，故未幾仍見下退，散戶均抱觀望，未敢輕易下手，行情愈見下瀉，市勢最低曾見一百六十元，臨收稍回至一百六十五元收盤。美亞市勢徬徨異常，市呈先堅後疲之勢，開盤四元五角，最低三元五角五分，收盤亦僅三元八角，餘股除商務印書館等有限數股外，市勢均呈恍惚。</p>
<p>後市市況銀根空前奇緊，暗息激漲，昨日午後交易以有二天高息，故多見漲停。永紗創二〇九元新價，統益景倫美亞新亞信誼火柴土泥國貨商務臺糖均登漲限，但申請交易部份，浮多壓於銀根，及不堪重息負荷，終續回售，一時了賣者多，永紗首告勁跌，低落至一三九元，臨收聞暗息略降，稍形扳穩，結果申請永紗美亞景福與其下午交易價格，乃至一漲一跌之錯綜，蓋全以二天日息而有參差也。各股比諸上日一致續升四角至三十五元，全日共做廿六億一一六五萬股。</p>
<h3>市塲散步</h3>
<p>— 看臺客</p>
<p>市場亦入戰時狀態　一窩風改向差別漲</p>
<p>軍事當局昨宣佈，本市已入戰時狀態；并宣佈八項緊急條例，受軍事管制。有關投機囤積及擾亂金融物價者，亦將予以軍法嚴治。</p>
<p>昨天市面經過，全部好轉，恢復平穩狀態，這是一大成就。唯一的遺憾，米市例外繼續狂漲，大行情都已漲出三百萬，門售價更可以想像。</p>
<p>米是民生必需品，本市民食的食米來源，三分之二雖權操政府之手，但際此軍事高於一切，軍穩比民糧，自是更為重要。因此，民食股憂，有待於積極向產區獻儲才行。否則，糧價獨漲，打破物價平衡時，有關物價上的一切努力，又要都屬無效了。</p>
<p>物價經犯漲後轉跌，軍事局勢的發展，對於一般物資的影響，將大有差別。吾人過去一再提及，譬如：笨重的會失　，輕便的會更俏。</p>
<p>昨天貨價全面平疲，而米價例外獨漲。是不是已屬新走勢的開展？沿難判明。但是可以斷言的：過去一窩風的走勢，遲早會被差別走勢替代的。</p>
<p>時間因素，對於新走勢的降臨與否，有其決定作用的。市場中人，一時在驚惶失措中，暫時汕港葉鮮判別與預測能力，亦未可知的。</p>
<p>吾人際此局勢中，最担心的，是廠商的前途。</p>
<p>作戰與工商精制維持，暫時尚可不談，目前應該關心的，倒是物價轉疲，甚展開若干物資的傾跌，足使關各業廠商生存的。</p>
<p>據昨傳，本市已有若干廠商，已經做歇。由此引起債務糾紛，失業糾紛，問題都很嚴重的。</p>
<p>薪資問題，必須有合理解決，并已邀軍政各當局的認識，依一般傾向，都在要求發銀元，或退而求其次，要求用銀元計薪</p>
<p>邇來發銀元券呼聲極高，如果工資發銀元云云，就是發與銀元券，那是很不妥當的。因為如此一來，不是保障職工生計，雙有玩弄職工之嫌，尤其在此時此地，是萬萬試不得的。</p>
<p>至於銀元計薪，關鍵在指數正確性者一，在發薪後物價之穩定者二，都很難逆覩的。</p>
<p>前天午後央行拋黃金一千多條，昨天上午銀很頗緊，據聞央行再加一鞭，所以緊勢延續至午後。</p>
<p>信用膨脹的結果，多數人謂為銀根易緊的主因。其實問題在信用膨脹，更在物價意外突變。昨物價平疲，資金周轉就發生困難，銀根告緊了。</p>
<p>當前，一切關鍵，都在大局如何發展。</p>
<p>最近數天內，可能有軍事徵發等行為，給予市場以深刻影響。</p>
<p>大市場物價狂漲，自是害人，但大市場停漲，而零售價續漲，停漲即能做到，只使工商界更苦，民生更糟。</p>
<p>市價一覽</p>

<p>足球聯賽甲組第二循環志超對帬力之戰，定於今日下午三時半在逸園角逐，門票普通一萬五千，特別三萬元，午后二時起在逸園大門發售。裁判張樂，巡邊員陸順德陳道宏。</p>
<p>按兩隊初循相逢各獲兩球，未分勝負，帬力在本賽中過去成績，雖未見如何，但麾下如姚季華，陳龍泉，林紹鈞，趙永芳等均屬沙塲憤戰，且全隊精神殊佳，戰鬥不懈，昨由該帬領隊潘時傑公佈陣容，決以全部精銳登塲，與志超一決雌雄，志超在吳祺祥熏陶下，頗多進境，近復挅練甚勤，屆時兩軍相逢，必有一塲劇戰，陣容誌后：</p>

<p>本市震旦大學法學院聯誼會為籌募基金，定於今日下午三時半特邀本市足球勁旅青白及葡商兩隊在該校球塲舉行義賣，由彭廉石院長開球，青白係海上盟主，素負盛名，葡商隊亦為足球界之人佼佼者，聞葡商為增強陣容，已向白鷹及西青二隊商借猛將，以圖與青白一決雌雄，屆時驍勇馳騁，兎起鶻落，必有一番血戰。又愁該賽門票大多由各同學之家長認購，本不擬公開出售，惟為　海上球迷計，特將部分門票於當日上午九時起在該校門房發售，每張計價三萬元，如逢天雨改星期日舉行，（地點重慶南路二八〇號震旦大學）茲錄兩隊陣容如下：</p>

<h3>揭開本季棒球幔幕　熊貓今日戰美水兵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕縱橫滬壖多年之壘球盟主熊貓隊，將於今日下午三時，在跑馬廳與美海軍狄振弋艦選手，作表演賽，正式挑開本市壘球季節幔幕。</p>
<p>熊貓在「熊貓之交」梁扶初領導下，為謀在本年壘球季中保持過去令名，早已開始練習。陣容方面，除新起捕手曹克家去臺，由老將王慶瑞出替外，陣容並無變動。投手仍為出球有無窮變化之名手李啓騰。梁門三傑分任三壘，游擊，及左翼。</p>
<p>狄振弋隊在週末四五次練習賽中，脾腉美軍其他各路雄師。進攻時擊球重遠，遠非滬上其他各隊所可比擬。</p>
<p>權衡兩隊實力，熊貓堅於守，美軍銳於攻，但華將合作有年，在梁扶初策劃下，進攻時亦能以刁讚短擊，攻人之短。勝利希望，當較濃厚。</p>
<p>總之，今午之戰，精彩定必紛呈，將為能進入跑馬廳之球迷之無上眼福。熊貓陣容如下：</p>
<p>投手：李啓騰　捕手：王慶瑞</p>
<p>一壘：梅英俊　二壘：溫天華</p>
<p>三壘：梁友文　游擊：梁友聲</p>
<p>左翼：梁友義　中堅：鐘保羅</p>
<p>右翼：廬兆森，蔡定中，巴舜，鄭德耀。</p>
<h3>港澳穗乒乓賽　決定七月會戰</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕澳門遠征星洲乒乓健兒一行十二人，出發前應港總會主席伍球添之邀參加仁人酒家五樓歡送會；並商討港·穗·澳三角埠際乒乓球賽的事情。</p>
<p>澳遠征健兒，在星預定比賽七塲，秩序亦經星總會編訂：首戰對抗星洲亞軍精武隊，次戰星洲冠軍隊，第三仗出擊北馬聯隊；此外，星洲聯隊，馬來亞選手隊，及馬來亞海陸空軍聯隊亦將相繼出師對抗，最後還有在怡保的一塲比賽。</p>
<p>關於三角埠際比賽，除港·澳主幹鐘榮光·伍球添·周振邦·賴端甫·陳公善·羅文輝·梁棠等外，廣州亦派有代表謝應鐘出席討論。</p>
<p>卽席議決辦理埠際賽各項程序如下：（一）組織港·穗·澳埠際乒乓賽委員會，辦理有關埠際賽的一切事宜。（二）每埠派代表三人擔任委員，每次會議由主方派出一人當任主席。（三）埠際賽每年巡迴在各地舉行一次（卽共三次），主塲次序拈籌分別先後。（四）男子埠際賽規定每隊正選代表七名，後備三名；女子比賽規定正選三名，後備兩名。（五）男子賽共七塲，每塲採三盤二勝制，勝者得一分，以先獲四分者作勝算。女子比賽三塲，先獲二分，作為勝論。球例依照世界乒乓規例執行，每盤廿一分計算。（六）比賽用球係採硬球為原則。（七）各隊旅費及食宿均由客隊自備，所有收入門券統歸主隊所得，該費係用以興建球室基金之需，不得移作別用。（八）各埠球員規定必須居留三個月以上方有被選資格。（九）第一屆埠際賽獎品由澳商何賢捐贈純銀盃乙座，由得勝次數最多的一隊獲獎；如遇得勝次數相同時，則以塲數得分判別；再遇分數相同時，則應以盤數為判別。（十）本年度的埠際賽由七月開始，至翌年六月底止。</p>
<p>埠際賽辦法擬定後，跟着拈籌編訂第一次比賽在澳門舉行，第二次在香港，第三次在廣州。首次比賽日期須待澳征星隊歸來後繼決定。港方以埠際賽揭幕期不遠，已決定由賽務部周振邦，鐘作庸負責從速舉辦全港公開男女單打比賽，作為遴選埠際打賭準備。</p>
<h3>印足球征港成畫餅　爪哇擬邀南華比賽</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕前傳南華會去函印度接洽邀請印度足球隊來港比賽。昨據確息：南華已接印方函覆，表示因種種關係，不能派隊前來遠東比賽；同時也沒有請南華往印度比賽的表示。</p>
<p>現據另一方面的情報說：爪哇方面正擬邀請南華前往那裏比賽，但能否成事，還要等待最後的決定。</p>
<h3>九九田徑明日練習</h3>
<p>本市九九田徑隊，定明日（廿四）上午八時仍在中正公園舉行第三次總練習，全體隊員將準時出席。</p>
<h3>仁餘麥令兩強　爭奪分部首席　市長盃籃球賽秩序有更動</h3>
<p>四屆市長盃籃球賽，為提早結束，因將秩序予以調動，俾資緊湊，而利結束。男女分部首席，至廿六日均可產生，廿八日起舉行甲女組四強單循環賽，預期五月上旬，兩組錦標及落選錦標，可全部解決。又原定廿四日六時半健樂對警機之落選賽，因警機棄權一次取樂資格，故健樂不勞而晉級。</p>

<p>民立——雅隊（女初）五時卅分</p>
<p>友隊——培爾（落選）六時一刻</p>

<p>首塲女子初賽，民立對雅隊，後者於日前友賽中首度漏臉，以卅二對廿四擊潰力隊，旗開得勝，戰將朱敏·孫鳳竹·朱家珍·江澤綸·錢夢月輩，俱屬此中能手，表演出眾，民立乃校隊翹楚，亦具相當戰力，但逢名將畢集之雅隊，誠恐兇多吉少。</p>
<p>第二塲男子落選賽，友隊對培爾，友隊擁有王徵君夏智昂陳孝發張明仁四騎士，極具威力，培爾多大學健將，胥年青力壯之輩，相逢當有鏖戰。</p>
<p>末幕男子複賽，仁餘對麥令斯，爭取分部首席，勝者得晉入四強單循環賽，事關錦標前途，雙方均將戮力以赴。仁餘乃本屆聯賽亞軍，沈鵬舉孫國政姚文彝吳新運王槐庭李肇和，俱沙塲久戰，而徐仲已近況彌佳，荘逸榮重作馮婦，聲勢益盛，麥令斯番兵個個身強力壯，日前對大公之友賽中，不但表演出色，並予大公絕大威脅，今晚與仁餘可稱旗鼓相當，工力悉敵。今晚六路人馬錄下：</p>

<p>本市中青年會，西青，海青，美童公學，俄僑體育會，聖約翰六團體主辦中西田徑運動會，定五月十四日在美童公學舉行，中青邀請本市田徑名將參加角逐，主辦當局為聯絡友誼檢討實力，如天氣良好今日下午二時先行友誼賽，項目因時間關係，略有刪減，茲錄項目及中青邀請運動員名單如下：（項目）百公尺，二百公尺，四百公尺，八百公尺，一千六百公尺，跳高，跳遠，三級跳，十六磅鉛球，（名單）王松濤，陳劍華，周元雄，張守智，藍焜陽，徐德懋，吳滋恩，張之青，蔡振道，黃桂蘭，陳世誼，吳世儉，陶聯芳，柯炳炎，陳良琛，郭亨耀，陸鶴聲，殷雲瑞，安然，楊保羅。</p>
<h3>今晚乒乓甲組賽　霸主精武戰青聯　前晚華美以五對零全勝綢白</h3>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽，今晚（廿三日）七時起續有甲組一幕及乙組三塲，甲組改在慈淑大樓三樓精分球室舉行，由精武對壘青聯，精武為上屆錦標，實力雄厚，堅強無比，全運會乒乓冠軍王友信仍在麾下，他如全材宿將歐陽維，及二度壓倒第一流好手傳其芳之張孚瑋，球藝優越，燴靈人口，對於本屆錦標仍具最大把握。青聯為相差一級之隊伍，實非其敵，今晚相逢，恐有全軍覆沒之慮，惟端賴隊長劉保泰一人，如能於名單中避重就輕，再以不餒之戰鬥精神，或可於僥倖機會中打破鴨蛋紀錄。</p>
<p>乙組三塲無關重要，星光信誼綢紅三隊實力較強一籌，當可順利晉級，茲探錄今晚各塲秩序及甲組兩隊名單如下：</p>
<p>精武——青聯（甲組）七時正精分</p>
<p>星光——明星（乙三）八時半精總</p>
<p>信誼——滬警（乙二）七時正信誼</p>
<p>綢紅——金門（乙三）七時正綢業</p>
<p>（精武）張孚瑋（隊長），歐陽維，楊開運，王友信，李龍標，陳曾亮，高鴻興，水涵高。</p>
<p>（青聯）劉保泰（隊長），汪宗澤，曹泰昌，黎沛然，梁蔓輝，杜伯儒，沈倫璋，屠幼慈。</p>
<p>前晚甲組華美與綢白交綏，於綢業公所大禮堂，到觀眾四百餘人，情況熱烈，聯賽總幹事陳霖笙亦到塲協助擔任裁判，綢白自知不敵華美之饒勇，但仍精神抖擻，以觀摩之心緒應戰，女將孫梅英且出打頭陣，帬眾為之鼓掌助威，終以力弱不支，為華美李宗沛所挫。其餘四組，綢白接連敗陣，惟老將孔漢臣，抽擊甚穩，竟予華美削手王九慶威脅不少，九慶卒於長削中，以二對一取勝，華美主將薛緒初未出全力，小將薛偉初，首上大陣，極見努力，前途大有希望。尤以身經百戰之陸漢俊，寶刀不老，風頭最健，對手新人，趙振遠技差一着，無法招架而退，結果華美以五對〇大勝綢白。乙組六塲中乙二部聯合劇戰公交，宿將朱建章果出陣助戰，不幸以一對二為公交主將盛日昇所敗，但結果聯合以三對二力克公交，可謂因禍得福。乙三部經緯小將則遭遇農機之痛擊，隊長邙培鈞失常，可勝不勝，竟致影響大局，結果農機以四對一擊敗經緯。茲探錄甲組兩隊戰績及乙組各塲結果如下：</p>
<p>（華美）　比數　（綢白）</p>
<p>李宗沛　廿一——十七　廿一——十八　孫梅英</p>
<p>薛緒初　廿一——十六　廿一——十八　楊昌熙</p>
<p>王九慶　廿一——十六　十七——廿一　廿一——十一　孔漢臣</p>
<p>陸漢俊　廿一——六　廿一——九　趙振遠</p>
<p>薛偉初　廿一——十六　廿一——十一　劉振秋</p>
<p>乙組結果</p>

<h3>美大學籃球冠軍隊　兩名指導怪傑</h3>
<p>— 戚公·上</p>
<p>美國的肯脫基Kentucky　大學等于隊和聖路斯St　Lowis大學籃球隊是優秀的球隊，前者由著名的阿杜爾夫洛甫Adolph　Rupp擔任教導，後者是著名的歇克蓋　Ed　Hickey指導。肯脫基隊是一九四五年全美邀請賽的冠軍隊，這球隊中沒有巨人，而是表顯著一個迅速，有力，射籃準確的勁旅。聖路斯是一九四九年季以四二比四〇克肯脫基而　組奧侖Sugak　Bowl錦標，這隊球隊五位都是巨人，是依賴巨人球員，該兩隊球隊固然是熟練和各球員之間個別技巧優良，及指導者教練有方和指導得法才得收獲豐功偉績，以下就是這兩位名指導的理論，特編撰起來，以供籃球指導者和後起者作為參考資料。</p>
<p>阿杜爾夫洛甫</p>
<p>他是肯脫基大學的教授，除一九四六年至四七年外，服務該大學已有十六年，他所指導的籃球隊共賽二百八十三塲，而僅曾失敗六十四塲，直到現在他仍在檢討着這六十四塲失敗之癥結所在，又曾在五年餘的時期中，該隊連續在四十五塲重要比賽中獲勝。</p>
<p>肯脫基之運動員在聯賽協會規章內所準許可獲得每運動員可得到住宿的房間，免學費，書籍，洗衣服，及每月給十圓津貼之優待，致阿氏在每年有代他的籃球員分配十五名運動員免費學額之權。</p>
<p>阿氏可算是全美國籃球指導獲得最高薪俸的教授，年俸為八千五百元。</p>
<p>在一九三〇年開始，他已創訂一種新戰法之打法，在當時肯脫基及南部各學校之球隊都側重「緩攻法」的戰術，這稱為「伊爾連挪斯制」，而阿氏獨創新風格，他宣佈要創立一項「迅攻法」的戰術。</p>
<p>當阿氏決定指導新戰術之後，該校的「週刋」體育欄之編者曾著論謂阿氏之嘗試未知能否成功，抱着懷疑之態度，蓋該隊對於「緩攻法」經已熟練，一旦改弦易轍，深恐難得以臂使隊在南部錦標決賽時，在最後四十秒鐘以廿九比廿七之成績被瑪里侖隊所敗。</p>
<p>該體育欄編者聆到敗訊，含淚執筆來撰評文，認為各健兒已各盡其智能，為母校出力，雖敗猶榮，這是該隊採用新戰術後，尚未得到百份之百成功，縱不幸而失去奪標之機會，但在戰術上已有顯著之進步和驚人之演出。</p>
<p>阿杜爾夫洛甫年四十六歲，於一九三七年患脊骨癱瘓癥，曾有一個時期左手運用欠靈活，須要用右手伸向左方的褲袋裏取物，經名醫許勃靈董施用手術後，漸告復原，但仍須戴上一具銅和皮造的圍腰，坐在椅子上來指導球隊，現在已經全愈了。</p>
<p>阿氏精於指導球隊運用裹檔煙幕之進攻技巧，該球隊運用純熟之陣式，隊員之移動，有默契之合作，其機巧絕非其他球隊可及。</p>
<p>在防禦方面，阿氏早已捨棄區域防禦制而主張採用人釘人之防禦制，據他的理論謂：對方在施用陣式來取攻勢時而守者採用被動的區域防禦制，處處在於被動之地位，往往被人捷足先登，進攻者控球在手，作條左條右之迅扭準繩之傳遞，迫使守衛移動，被牽制一合一離，一取一散，都是被動的，等到守衛者的區域有空隙的時間，進攻者就從那個空隙處竄進去建功，這樣被動的防守方式是難得獲勝的。</p>
<p>阿氏教授一項「高級籃球技巧」的課程，這項課程最適宜於將來要擔任指導職務的人們去選讀。</p>

<h3>我的健忘</h3>
<p>— 愛揚</p>
<p>我常常喜歡把鈔票尤其是新的大鈔夾在書裏當書簽。可是要用起來，往往要把架上的書，一本一本的翻尋殆啟遍，才會發現不久以前的「庫藏」。醫生說我非停止抽烟，停止寫稿，并服補藥，增加睡眠不行。否則，「這健忘症的後果不堪設想」云云。當時聽了，為之毛骨悚然，連忙把手裏還有的大半支香烟熄滅。但過後不久，我再三「用力」回憶醫生教導我的保養之道時，却一點也記不起了。原來又犯了健忘症！</p>
<p>燈下，友人互相談物價，感嘆過大頭漲到四十萬之後，甲忽然問上個月的今天大頭賣多少？四五個人竭力回憶，却沒有一個人「憶」得出來。甲又問三天前的米介是多少？有的說二百萬，有的說二百五十萬，查一查報紙，也沒有一個回答對的。談話旋由金圓而到法幣，我問道：法幣的最高面額是多少？各人睜目咧口，不知道所對。大家都奇怪地說：怎麼我們的記憶都這樣壞了？</p>
<p>至此，本人心中大為高興，——頗有點幸災樂禍的樣子，原來犯健忘症的，固不獨我一個也。</p>
<p>誰使大家健忘呢？</p>
<p>丙說：都是那部印鈔機作怪。</p>
<p>但，印鈔機好象也是患健忘症的，不到一年以前，法幣由千而萬，而十萬·百萬·千萬……終于頹然崩潰。而今天金圓也由千而萬·而五萬·十萬……，且其速度之快，有如「駕輕就熟」者然。印鈔機祇一味求出貨迅速，已忘了法幣崩潰的往事了。</p>
<p>我想：橫堅大家都患了健忘症，猶如大家都留西式頭發一樣，有什麼值得稀奇呢？至少，我健忘了，不致於記起昨天的物價，甚至還忘了此刻的物價，糊糊塗塗地，用不到像他人之戰慄於「又漲了幾倍了！」這豈不是天大之福嗎？</p>
<h3>犬之智</h3>
<p>— 桑</p>
<p>偶然談起狗的聰明，有一個說了一個故事：某家曾有過一只非常聰敏的獵狗。一夜家裏忽然失火了，火勢非常猛烈，大家都為不及搶出一點東西，甚至臥室裏還有一個孩子，也沒有救出來。這時，那只獵狗衝進屋子，不久就把孩子啣出來了。主人歡喜得流出淚來。但是，忽然那只狗又衝進了火焰，大家正覺得驚訝，為之擔心的當兒，它却又竄出來了。火焰已經灼傷了它的皮毛，嘴裏却啣着——那張火險保險單！</p>
<h3>淮陰的麺食</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>江北的淮陰縣，在民前稱為清江浦。當津浦。平漢兩路未修築，海運未暢通前，其地為南北的交通孔道，北上南下的旅客，皆在此處換船換車。又駐有河警·漕警兩行政機關，河工人員飲食之奢侈，是名聞天下的。自黃河北徙，漕米改為海運，鐵路輪船漸興，清江浦在清季已漸漸衰落。然淮菜，淮點，至今仍負重名。民初余在非園（甘翰臣之花園）飲酒，一次曾吃到朱疆邨老人家淮廚所製之燙麺餃，皮薄紹鮮，與揚點比較，又別有一種風味。北平有一種手車售燙麺餃者，車板上有蒸籠，熱氣騰騰，一聲吆喝，不但平民圍而食之，大宅門亦有僕人持器而購之者。此為故都小食之一，余極嗜之。去年有一小報載梅博士喜吃燙麺餃，特自北平請來廚子專製此點，不知淮餃尤勝於北平所製也。</p>
<p>民廿年長江一帶大水，其時胡樸安任江蘇民政廳廳長，以余曾助馮煦辦過義賑，請余查江都·高郵·寶應·淮城·淮陰·泗陽六縣之災。余與內政部所派之袁委員同往。在七月的大熱天，余等查災到淮陰的一「河下」鎮，鎮上有一「文樓」茶館，售湯包極有名，余等往嚐之。其製與鎭揚之湯包不同，鎭揚者小而此特大，一籠上桌，開蓋，內有十餘枚，夥計用指提其頂部，高達二三寸，置於每人面前之五寸碟內，湯包平伏，幾占全碟，咬破其一角而徐吸之，滷多而鮮美異常，不善食者，其湯將濺滿衣袖。當時有縣政府某君領導余等往吃此名點者，言「吃淮陰湯包有一故事，極可發笑。內地人熱天吃早茶，或下午，大都赤膊而食，一外來客人初吃此物，一口咬破，遺憾的是包內滷濺及鄰座一食客之背，油汁淋漓，夥計擬以手巾揩之，食客囑其暫緩，夥計問故，此人言：「他還未吃了哩！」以此指湯包之滷多。足見淮陰此名點之特點，不同亽鎭揚之尋常小湯包也。</p>
<h3>栓得住麼？</h3>
<p>— 東生</p>
<h3>人體內的外物</h3>
<p>— 祝枕江</p>
<p>偶在申報自由談內見到記法國某地有一犯人，因想自殺而吞下開罐刀兩把，拆成十段的火鉗一把，四吋長的釘子五只，此外還有螺旋釘以及酒瓶的碎玻璃片苦干，結果竟被救未死。</p>
<p>關於這種例子，在醫學方面屢見不鮮。凡是這一類東西，都呌作「外物」，或稱「異物」。最常見的，是誤嚥假齒，以及吞入鈕扣金戒等等。在加拿大溫伯呢地方，有位華僑，當進餐時誤將刀叉和食物一同吞下，但開腹時，却祇見刀而不見叉，引為奇談。</p>
<p>我在倫敦醫史博物館中，見到一只放雞蛋的杯子（約七八公分高），是由一位六十歲的老人在三十五年前吞下了以後，覺得迴盲部有閉塞現象，而開腹挖出的。又見由一位十歲女孩胃中開出誤吞的物件極多，（一吋和半吋長的釘子，各約一二百只，此外尚有別針，羽毛等零星物件），結果也是治愈的。在該館中陳列的外物，尚有剪刀，玻璃片，寒暑表，虫類，刀子，銅元，眼鏡，錶等，琳瑯滿目，指不勝屈。</p>
<p>吞下外物件數特多的例子，據伊斯曼契氏說，有一精神病人，他共吞下五公分長的尖銳玻璃片一五七塊，黃銅別針一二〇只，銹鐵針一五〇只，　針三只，鐵片大小一五片，黃銅，靴扣，幕鈎等種種。但是是經過八個月後，都由肛門中排泄而出。</p>
<p>中國以前凡採參及管金庫的人，往往交人參和黃金珠寶等由肛門藏入直腸內帶出。這當然也得算是異物的一種。</p>
<p>當外科醫生行開腹術的時候，如不將刀剪，鑷子，布片等特別加以注意，往往有誤縫在腹內的危險。</p>
<p>凡有外物入消化系後，決不可服用瀉藥，以防腸胃穿孔，致轉腹膜炎。如用飯團馬鈴薯等吞入，較為妥當。最好的方法，當然是行X光檢查照射確定部位後，施行開腹術。然而我也曾遇到過一件怪事，有一病人吞嚥金戒後，在X光綫下所見的確無誤，而於開腹時，則腸胃中并無此物，原來他曾經大便過一次，早把戒指排泄出了。</p>
<h3>斯文掃地</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>據二十日本報載：「臺北某省立中學教員，因迫於生活辭職，改任美駐臺領事館工役，負責抹窗掃地，月支美金拆合臺幣數百萬元。」</p>
<p>教員以待遇不夠，甘愿做一個苦力，操着賤役，真符合了一句俗諺，呌做：「斯文掃地」！</p>
<p>經過了多少年的寒窗苦讀，為人導師，但所得的待遇，却微薄得不能養家活口。而一旦實行「斯文掃地」後，反能生活無優，這時代真是「斯文掃地」的年頭，真是還有何說？</p>
<h3>食品大觀園</h3>
<p>— 景欣</p>
<p>吃東西，不祇是塞飽肚子就算了，還要講口味好不好。由於各地特產的不同，飲食的口味也有差別，每一地方，每一民族，食物都有一種特殊的風味。在幾個大都市中，五方雜處，就可以嚐到各地方特殊風味的佳餚；但在一家菜館中，決不能吃到各處不同地方的滋味。</p>
<p>在紐約，有一家「翠石飯店」，它蒐集各民族食物的箐華，做成各種不同口味的菜餚供客。紐約的人口有四百萬，其中半數父母是外國人，或是生長在外國的；這許多的主顯，使翠石飯店做得極好的買賣。</p>
<p>當你踏進翠石飯店，坐定之後，待者就送上一份菜單。你看到那菜單，定要吃驚，那是厚厚的一本書，字印的密密地；假使你事先沒有準備，不知點那一種菜好，就是翻翻也得要不少時候了。在那本「菜單」裏，有二萬五千種以上的菜名，有法國式的拿破侖煎餅，義大利的蜂油通心粉，德國式的牛排，西班牙的生菜，挪威的海鮮……以及印度菜，土耳其菜，日本菜，應有盡有。中國菜是世界聞名，當然少不了的，菜單內也列着芙蓉蛋和什燴。這兩樣菜可代表中國菜麼？那是除了中國人自己之外，無法判斷了。</p>
<p>翠石飯店的布置，除了一座可容五千食客的大餐廳外，還有許多房間。房間的布置，不僅各不相同，還顯示出各地的景趣。有的是熱帶的情調，壁上畫着茂盛的棕櫚，椰林，顏色也配得炎夏的樣子，那是吃熱帶地區菜餚的。也有裝成寒帶的風景，人造的冰，棉花做的雪，增加了寒冷的氣息，那是吃北方菜的地方。主顧們不但吃到了特殊的小菜，且如處身異域，更增添了不少進餐的情趣。</p>
<p>翠石飯店的的食客，雖都能說英語，但為使地方氣味更加親切些，待者們儘可能地不講英語，而講當地的話。所以待者們都加以特殊訓練，能講許多不同的語言，最多的，能說四十餘種不同方言。旁人看來，他們都是語言學專家呢。</p>
<p>燒各地不同的菜餚，必須要當地的廚司，小菜的口味才不會走樣。所以翠石飯店的一百多名廚司，包括七十幾種不同籍貫，其中有個，還是該地廚司中的名手呢。若干廚司，分為一組，專管那一地區的小菜。所以菜單上的雖多，每個廚司所燒的，不過幾種。</p>
<p>魚，肉，蔬，果以及調味品等原料，除了普通的外，也都向當地去采辦。翠石飯店有很大的儲藏庫，叟藏着天南地北的各種物產。凡是吃的東西，幾乎那裏都可以找到。翠石飯店，真是集世界食品的大成了。</p>

<p>[Report from our Ningbo Correspondent on the 22nd] President Chiang arrived in Ningbo from Xikou at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. He then proceeded to the Lishe Airport and flew to Hangzhou on the Meiling Special Plane.</p>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] President Chiang arrived at Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport by plane from Xikou at around 11:00 AM on the 22nd. Acting President Li Zongren, He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Qun, Cheng Qian, Wu Zhongxin, Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Tang Enbo, and the chairmen of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces had all arrived at Jianqiao in advance to greet him. None of the dignitaries entered the city after arriving. Martial law has been declared along the road from Jianqiao to the Hangzhou city area. Furthermore, Zhejiang Chairman Zhou convened an emergency meeting on the evening of the 21st and decided to establish the Hangzhou City Defense Headquarters. Emergency martial law was declared in Hangzhou on the 22nd. The police force has been increased during the day and martial law will be implemented one hour earlier in the evening.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Acting President Li, Premier He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, and Bai Chongxi, four important officials, took the Chuiyun Special Plane from Nanjing to Hangzhou at 10:45 AM on the 22nd for important consultations with President Chiang. Gan Jihou, Cheng Siyuan, and many others accompanied them. Acting President Li and Premier He stayed in Hangzhou for four hours and then flew back to Nanjing from Hangzhou by special plane at 5:30 PM in the afternoon. Cheng Siyuan returned with them.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Central Committee member Zhang Daofan arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 21st. Representing the Guangzhou Central Executive Committee, he paid respects to the elders in Nanjing and conveyed the Central Executive Committee's hope for unity within the party to support Acting President Li and preside over future war efforts. After completing his mission, he returned to Shanghai on the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Report from our Fuzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] Confirmed information: President Chiang will visit Xiamen in the near future.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] The Information Office of the Executive Yuan issued a public statement on the 22nd stating that: In order to strive for overall peace and provide the people with an opportunity to recuperate, the government dispatched a delegation to Beiping to negotiate a cessation of hostilities and a restoration of peace with the Communist Party. After more than two rounds of negotiations, no agreement was reached. In the end, the Communist Party put forward a so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" with a deadline for response. The entire document, consisting of eight articles and twenty-four clauses, was entirely the disposition of a conqueror towards the conquered. Its purpose was to use force to eliminate the national army, create terror to destroy the people's freedom and social order, and at the same time launch a full-scale attack and forcibly cross the Yangtze River. At this point, it has become clear to the world that the Communist Party has no sincerity in seeking peace and is willing to destroy peace, expand the war, and become the enemy of the nation and the people. Today (the 22nd), President Chiang arrived in Hangzhou from Xikou, and Acting President Li and Premier He flew from Nanjing to Hangzhou to meet with him. They solemnly discussed the current situation and the government's future policies, and unanimously decided on the following four points: (1) Regarding the Communist Party issue, the government will resolutely fight to the end for the people's freedom and national independence. (2) In the political arena, unite with all democratic and freedom-loving people in the country to fight together. (3) In the military field, Premier He will concurrently serve as the Minister of National Defense, unifying the command of the army, navy, and air force. (4) Take emergency and effective measures to strengthen the unity of the Chinese Nationalist Party and the connection between the Party and the government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The President issued the following orders on the 22nd: (1) Xu Yongchang, the Minister of National Defense, is to be appointed exclusively as the President of the Army University. (2) He Yingqin is specially appointed as the Minister of National Defense concurrently. (3) The Minister of National Defense commands the national army, navy, and air force. (4) The Chief of Staff is to be changed to the Chief of Staff for the Minister of National Defense. The current organizational law of the Ministry of National Defense will be amended separately.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Returns to Hankou</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Before flying to Hangzhou on the 22nd, Zhang Qun told reporters at the airport that the current situation was indeed extremely serious and that he had decided to return to Sichuan immediately. When discussing his trip to Xikou, Zhang stated: Mr. Chiang has decided to fully support the government. After Bai Chongxi went to Hangzhou, he flew back to Hankou on the same day.</p>
<p>[Report from our Hankou Correspondent on the 22nd] Director Bai Chongxi, accompanied by Yang Shouqiong, returned to Hankou by plane at 4:30 PM on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Capital Evacuated of Officials Within Six Hours, Government Urges Envoys to Move to Guangzhou Again</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] After the Chinese Communist Party issued the order for a general offensive, the situation in the capital became increasingly tense and serious. In addition to Acting President Li and Premier He returning from Hangzhou, other important officials have left Nanjing one after another. Starting on the morning of the 22nd, special planes carrying legislators to Guangzhou, Guilin, and Taiwan took off one after another. In the afternoon, several planes carrying government officials left Nanjing. The government's emergency evacuation work is accelerating and is expected to be completed within one or two days.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 22nd] Within six hours after 10:00 AM on the 22nd, almost all officials had been evacuated. Airplanes at Nanjing Airport, loaded with the families and luggage of high-ranking officials, constantly took off from Nanjing to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and other southern Chinese cities. In addition to Acting President Li and Premier He, important officials from the Guangxi clique, including Interior Minister General Li Hanhun, flew to Hangzhou. Li Zongren's wife and the families of other Guangxi officials flew to Guilin. Other ministers flew to either Shanghai or Guangzhou. Only Education Minister Hang Liwu remained in Nanjing. It is rumored that he will leave Nanjing on an American Embassy plane in an emergency.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Residents here did not show any signs of panic on the 22nd. A curious crowd even gathered on the riverside in the morning to watch the artillery battles north of the river. Business here is proceeding as usual. Some shops were closed due to slow business. Movie theaters remained open. The sound of silver dollars jingling on the streets could still be heard, and scalpers were still active.</p>
<p>[Our Report] China National Aviation Corporation dispatched fifteen planes yesterday, and Central Air Transport Corporation dispatched eight planes yesterday, to Nanjing to assist government departments with emergency evacuation matters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] In January, the government moved its offices to Guangzhou from February 5th due to the threat to the capital from the Communist army. It also notified the embassies of various countries in China, requesting them to move with them. Representatives of various embassies came to Guangzhou at that time, but most of the envoys and their staff remained in Nanjing. Now that the Communist army has relaunched its offensive and Nanjing has become a war zone, the government, in order to ensure the safety of envoys from various countries and their staff, specifically notified the embassies again on the 22nd, urging them to move to Guangzhou as soon as possible, and telegraphed our embassies abroad to make the same representations to local governments.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Foreign diplomatic missions here received a notice from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 22nd, advising them to evacuate to Guangzhou. According to reliable sources, it has been learned that foreign diplomatic missions have decided to remain in Nanjing. It is generally believed that this decision was made at a secret meeting held by various diplomatic missions on the morning of the 22nd. A few days ago, major Atlantic Treaty nations held a secret meeting and decided to remain here even in the midst of the crisis of Communist occupation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The government's various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions had previously decided to move their offices to Guangzhou. A joint office was established by the various Ministries and Commissions of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing to maintain liaison. However, recently, due to the Chinese Communist Party expanding the war and invading south across the river, the government has decided to abolish this office and move all offices to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Bao Jing'an Arrives in Shanghai and Says, Although the War Situation is Quite Serious, It Is Not as Critical as Imagined</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Bao Jing'an, Director of the Information Office of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday afternoon. It is said that the situation in the capital is still good. Although the war situation is quite serious, it is not as critical as imagined. Although the situation in Digang and Jiangyin has changed, the government is still determined to defend the river. The evacuation of various Yuan and Ministries from Nanjing does not mean a change of capital. According to the decision of February 5th, the government will conduct business in Guangzhou from now on. In principle, the government should not remain on the front lines. Bao confirmed that Acting President Li and Premier He will come to Shanghai in the coming days. Premier He will stay in Shanghai for several days to give instructions. The entire Presidential Office will not move to Shanghai, but some important officials within the Presidential Office will come to Shanghai in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Arrives in Shanghai, Taiyuan Still Firmly Held</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, flew from Nanjing to Shanghai by civil aviation plane at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. Yan told reporters at the airport that Taiyuan was fighting well and that more than 10,000 bandits had been annihilated on the morning of the 22nd. After arriving in Shanghai, he would continue to direct Taiyuan's military affairs by telephone.</p>
<p>[Our Report] According to a broadcast by the Chinese Communist Party radio station at 10:10 PM last night, the National Army in Taiyuan is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army. The rumor that it has already fallen is not accurate. Xu Xiangqian and Zhou Shidi, the commander and deputy commander of the Communist army attacking Taiyuan, and Political Commissar Luo Ruiqing, are still using the Xinhua Radio Station to continue broadcasting the "Letter to All Citizens in Taiyuan City," urging them to lay down their weapons and stop resisting. This proves that the walls of Taiyuan City are still being firmly defended by the National Army. According to the Chinese Communist Party, the troops attacking Taiyuan this time are composed of a mixture of the three major field armies of Northeast, North China, and Northwest, and the offensive is extremely fierce. It is said that although there are breaches in the strongholds around the suburbs of the city, the urban area is still being firmly defended by the National Army.</p>
<h3>Presidents of the Legislative and Control Yuans Arrive in Shanghai, Yu Youren Speaks with a Heavy Heart About the Current Situation, Legislators in Shanghai to Hold Discussion Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, Finance Minister Liu Gongyun, and Weng Wenhao arrived in Shanghai by special plane from Nanjing at 5:00 PM yesterday. Yu met with reporters in the evening and spoke with a heavy heart about the current situation. He said that he would stay in Shanghai for a few days before going to Guangzhou. Yu admitted that a peaceful resolution to the national crisis was hopeless. As for the future evolution of the war situation, he was not a military man and could not give an answer. As for future diplomatic relations, this was originally a part of the peace talks. As of now, on the surface, he does not see anything that is beneficial to the government. The newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs is still on his way home, and Vice Minister Ye is often in Guangzhou, and he has little contact with him, so he cannot give a detailed analysis of this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] More than two hundred legislators have arrived in Shanghai recently. Ye Suzhong, Liu Zanzhou, Li Yu, Yang Yifeng, Xie Chengyu and other thirty-three members have jointly launched a discussion meeting at 3:00 PM on the 23rd at the New Life Club at 184 Tongfu Road to exchange opinions on the current situation and discuss the issue of going south.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Liu Zhe, Vice President of the Control Yuan, led more than sixty members of the Control Yuan and more than ten staff members to Shanghai by three special planes on the afternoon of the 22nd. The remaining members of the Control Yuan in Nanjing will come to Shanghai successively. The Control Yuan has sent personnel to Shanghai to negotiate for plane and ship seats to go to Taiwan and Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Scheduled to Continue Meeting in Guangzhou in Early May</h3>
<p>[Report from our Guangzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] More than twenty legislators from Nanjing arrived in Guangzhou on the 22nd, including Vice President Liu Jianqun. It is said that the Legislative Yuan's general meeting will continue to be held in Guangzhou in early May.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Zhu Jiahao, a member of the Political Council, and a group of legislators flew to Guangzhou by special plane on the morning of the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] Legislators in Guangzhou held a symposium on the morning of the 22nd, attended by more than eighty members. Xu Yuanquan was elected as the chairman. First, Li Dong announced the statement on the current situation and telegrams to express condolences to the officers and soldiers on the front lines, and then discussions began, all of which were amended and passed. It was also agreed to establish a "Preparatory Committee for the Resumption of the Legislative Yuan in Guangzhou," and Xu Yuanquan and other twenty-one people were elected as executive members of the preparatory committee to actively carry out the preparatory work for the resumption of the meeting.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Actively Moving in Henan and Hubei</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hengdian Correspondent on the 22nd] Military Information: Communist troops in southern Henan and eastern Hubei are still actively moving, and most of the National Army defending the outer perimeter of Wuhan has arrived at their designated positions. According to a military spokesman, no matter how strong the opponent's pressure is, the National Army will not easily abandon the important strongholds around Wuhan (including Huangpi and Xiaogan). Furthermore, when the reporter drove to the National Army positions near Xiaogan this morning for inspection, he saw soldiers of a certain division digging trenches beside the railway. During breaks from work, they were helping farmers cut grass in the wheat fields and vegetable plots. The morale of the Huaizhong front line and the people's hearts were vastly different from the past. After learning of the news of the Communist army's general offensive, their hope had obviously turned into anger.</p>
<p>[Report from our Hankou Correspondent on the 22nd] River defenses in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River are tightening. Two naval cruisers sailed from a certain place to patrol near Jiujiang last night. Furthermore, the Hubei River Police Department has recently been ordered to concentrate all boats moored north of the Yangtze River to the south bank, and the pontoons on the Hankou riverside must also be moved to Wuchang.</p>
<h3>US Authorities in Japan Prepare to Send Planes, Ships, and Manpower to China, US Embassy Urges American Nationals in Nanjing to Evacuate</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd] It was learned here today that U.S. military officials in the Far East Command in Japan are now preparing to take any action, in accordance with orders from Washington, to protect American citizens in China. Reliable sources said that "if necessary," the U.S. will dispatch planes, ships, and manpower from Japan to China to protect U.S. interests. However, it was carefully pointed out that this action is not expected to be taken at the moment, but U.S. military leaders here will be ready to provide the necessary assistance at any time.</p>
<p>U.S. and Allied officials here are now closely watching the rapidly changing situation in China. Most qualified observers believe that it will not be long before the area under MacArthur's command becomes the only remaining important listening post outside the Iron Curtain in this part of the world.</p>
<p>At the same time, many Japanese feel that the Chinese Communist Party's bold actions (referring to the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River) will be echoed by actions from the Japanese Communist Party. The Japanese Communist Party now has unprecedented strength in the Japanese Diet and is gaining momentum due to the surge of the red tide in Asia. If the Chinese Communist Party achieves complete control of China, the U.S. outposts in Japan, Korea, and the Ryukyu Islands will become even more important, as the Chinese Communist Party's control of all of China will bring the Communist Party to the edge of the U.S. outer defense line in the Pacific.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] The U.S. Embassy notified all American nationals in Nanjing on the 22nd to immediately use commercial transportation to leave Nanjing unless they are "forced to remain here to deal with any emergency situation." The embassy further warned that it cannot provide emergency protection or engage in evacuating Americans in an emergency, as the U.S. naval ships originally stationed in Nanjing have been transferred to Shanghai, and the Marine Corps guard has been reduced to only enough to temporarily protect internal security.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] A State Department spokesman said on the 21st that the department had not received any reports of Americans injured in the fighting along the Yangtze River or elsewhere in China. According to recent statistics, there are 4,023 American nationals in China, and government officials are closely monitoring all possible reports.</p>

<p>[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] According to confirmed information, Dai Rongguang, the commander of the Jiangyin Fortress, led his troops of about two regiments and formally defected to the Communist Party on the night of the 21st. At the same time, he secretly aimed all the fortress guns at four naval warships anchored in the river, preventing them from attacking. As a result, more than 3,000 Communist troops from the Communist Party who crossed the Yangtze River along the south of the river from Jingjiang on the north bank smoothly crossed the Yangtze River on the night of the 21st under this situation. According to news at 6:00 PM on the 22nd, the Communist troops fleeing south have been divided into several groups, one of which has approached within 20 miles north of the railway between Wujin and Wuxi. The National Army is encircling and attacking them. According to reports, the main reason for Dai's defection was his corruption, which had been credibly accused, so he defected to the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Report from our Wujin Correspondent on the 22nd] Last night, there was a loud boom of artillery fire north of Wujin all night long. A large number of Communist troops secretly crossed the river at Taohuagangkou on the border between Wujin and Cheng County. They were discovered by the local garrison and subjected to fierce gunfire. Most of the ships were sunk, and a group of about 2,000 people took advantage of the darkness to flee to the south bank and flee to Xutang, Shishu, Huangtu and other places. Local Communist forces also joined in the reception. On the morning of the 22nd, the situation in the north of Wujin was quite tense. After the National Army urgently dispatched troops to encircle and suppress them, about 200 people were captured separately in Panshu and other places in the afternoon, and the rest were wiped out. The National Army suffered slight damage. The search is continuing, and order in the city is as usual.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Tonight, artillery fire in Nanjing has continued all night long, and clear machine gun fire can be heard intermittently, but the citizens remain calm as usual. Puzhen on the north bank was automatically abandoned after midnight.</p>

Furthermore, at about 1:00 AM on the morning of the 23rd, more than 500 Communist troops from Huaizikou, east of Pukou, attempted to forcibly cross the river to Xiaguan by boat, but were repelled. Furthermore, the Zhaoshangju near the Sun Yat-sen Wharf in Xiaguan is already within the range of Communist machine gun fire, and the National Army is retaliating.</p>
<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang Correspondent on the 22nd] It is also learned that it was widely rumored on the morning of the 21st that the situation in Yangzhong was unclear, and Heshangzhou was occupied by the Communist army last night.</p>

Furthermore, the Guazhou bridgehead west of Six Mile Reach was also abandoned at 11:00 AM on the same morning. Thus, except for Huaizikou, all the bridgeheads on the north bank east of Pukou have fallen into the hands of the Communist army.</p>
<p>Sketch Map from Nanjing to Jiangyin</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Shiyezhou in the Yangtze River north of Zhenjiang is still being firmly defended by the National Army. On the nights of the 21st and 22nd, the 34th Army of the Communist army on the north bank continued to bombard and attempt to land, but were all repelled.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Pays Attention to Our Situation, Believes That the Final Outcome of the War Is Very Important to the US</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd] It was learned on the 22nd that General MacArthur is closely watching the situation in China and believes that the final outcome of the resumption of the war is very important to the United States. MacArthur believes that the extent of the China problem deserves consideration by U.S. officials when formulating global policies. It is said that MacArthur believes that many Americans pay too much attention to Europe and ignore the equally explosive situation here. Reliable sources say that MacArthur firmly believes that (1) China is of great strategic importance to the United States, (2) When properly considered, it can be thought that China contributes to the stability and progress of the future American way of life and is very beneficial to the United States. (3) The United States should not deny its long-standing friendly relationship with China</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Suzhou Impose Earlier Curfews, Long-Distance Buses Partially Resume on Suzhou-Yu Lines</h3>

<p>[Report from our Wuxi Correspondent on the 22nd] Due to the serious situation, an earlier curfew was imposed here starting on the evening of the 22nd, and traffic was cut off at 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>[Report from our Wuxi Correspondent on the 22nd] The county government, under orders, requisitioned fifteen large buses from Wuxi, Xicheng, Xihu, and Jiangnan companies to drive to Changzhou for concentration. Furthermore, the Xicheng long-distance bus only goes as far as Qingyang, and the Xicheng direct bus has been suspended and is only for military use.</p>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] The city defense department was ordered by the First Pacification Zone to advance the curfew time in this city to 10:00 PM starting on the 23rd. Stores and theaters will also close one hour earlier. Furthermore, the 296th garrison division has been transferred to another location, and the city defense duties have been changed to be directly under a certain unit of the Provincial Security Command. According to Commander Li, who spoke to reporters, at this time of military urgency, any gangster who takes the opportunity to spread rumors and disrupt public order will be killed without mercy.</p>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] Long-distance buses from Suzhou to Changshu, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other places partially resumed service on the 22nd, but the number of trips will depend on the number of buses. Small cars on each line are running as usual.</p>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] In order to rush to build bunkers and strongholds, the First Pacification Zone urgently telegraphed the county government on the 21st to requisition 5,400 laborers and 98 male and female workers. After receiving the order, the county government has convened a meeting of township chiefs to quickly gather them.</p>
<p>[Report from our Wuxi Correspondent on the 22nd] A fire broke out outside the north gate of Jiangyin on the evening of the 22nd. The artillery fire from the north could also be heard in the northern suburbs of Wuxi. The area between Wuxi and Cheng County has entered a state of war, and commercial telegrams between Wuxi and Cheng County are also unavailable.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Crossing the Yangtze in Central Anhui Capture Datong and Qingyangkou, National Army Dispatches Strong Troops to Complete Bag-Shaped Position</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] The south bank bridgehead position established by the Communist army in central Anhui on the south bank of the Yangtze River, from Sanshan in the east to Tongling in the west, has expanded to the west of Datongzhen since the night of the 21st, and its front is about 160 miles wide. Datongzhen has also fallen. It is reported that in recent days, as many as three armies, about 70,000 people, have crossed over to the south bank at night. The so-called 300,000 people in the Xinhua News Agency broadcast is obviously an exaggeration. According to what was learned this afternoon, the Communist troops have penetrated Qingyangkou, and a group has penetrated to an area more than 20 kilometers west of Xuancheng between Nanling and Jing County. The National Army has dispatched strong troops and completed a bag-shaped position, hoping to eliminate them in one fell swoop.</p>

<h3>How to Suppress Grain Prices in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In recent decades, commodity prices have been rising daily, seemingly without end. Financial authorities are exerting all their efforts to tighten credit in order to suppress the rising tide of prices. However, apart from financial commodities such as gold, silver, foreign currency, and stocks sometimes falling back, the rise in grain prices has never slightly receded. Taking last week's situation as an example, the price of white japonica rice in the South Market rose by more than 2.1 times, in the North Market by 2.3 times, and the price of Lao Che Noodles flour also rose by more than 2 times. This week, due to the turbulent situation and the breakdown of peace talks, the resumption of war has caused grain prices to rise even more sharply, especially rice, which is close to a state of chaos. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau stipulated that the price of white japonica rice should not exceed two million yuan per picul, but rice merchants were unwilling to sell their goods on the market because the cost was not enough, and the market was at a standstill, with retail prices reaching as high as three million two hundred thousand yuan. How can these ordinary people not feel the threat of "white terror"! People depend on food as their heaven, and the people's food problem is the root of everything. If we allow it to rise naturally without restraint, the consequences will be unimaginable. We hope that the municipal authorities and security organs will quickly come up with a solution to thoroughly resolve this most difficult food problem.</p>
<p>We have studied the reasons for the recent surge in food prices, which include the following: (1) High prices in production areas, with costs exceeding the price limit. For example, rice prices in Wuxi and Zhoupu have reached two million yuan per picul, and the demand is very strong, so owners are waiting to see what happens, making transactions difficult to initiate. (2) The Communist side has brazenly ordered a general offensive, attempting to forcibly cross the Yangtze River. The war has gradually shifted from the north bank of the Yangtze River to the south, causing public unrest and a rush to store rice and grain, which has invisibly greatly increased the demand for rice and grain, and prices have also risen accordingly. (3) In the past, the city's rice was purchased from Wuxi, Wuhu, Sichuan, Hunan, and various places near the city. However, at present, the Yangtze River shipping is interrupted, and rice from Sichuan and Hunan cannot be transported to Shanghai; after the rice source in Wuhu—the counties in the Chaohu Lake basin—changed hands, it is fundamentally impossible to supply the city any longer. At the same time, a large army is gathering along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, and the supply of rice in the Wuxi area naturally cannot be as abundant as before. Moreover, the amount of rice produced in the suburbs of this city is limited after all, and what's more, the garrison in this city has suddenly increased recently, and the burden of food has become heavier. (4) General commodity prices are rising in a competitive manner, and grain is a necessity, so grain prices are unwilling to fall behind. In addition, the current period is the spring plowing season when the old and new crops are not yet connected, and there is a lack of rice and grain everywhere, which has led to a sudden rise in grain prices.</p>
<p>Judging from the above-mentioned inhibitory factors, it can be said that the vast majority are affected by the situation and people's minds. Now, to curb the rise in grain prices, the first step is only to start with stabilizing people's minds. To stabilize people's minds, some of the stored grain in the authorities' "Three-Month Grain Storage Plan" should be released to temporarily meet the urgent need and stabilize market prices. Secondly, the limit for household rice allocation should be relaxed to meet the actual needs of each person per month. As long as the supply is guaranteed monthly, rice prices can be stabilized. Thirdly, it is also important to dredge the source of food. In today's situation of sluggish domestic transportation and the urgent need for military food, it is best to directly find ways to purchase from Siam, Annam, and other places as a precaution. Although 120,000 piculs of U.S. aid rice arrived in the city the day before yesterday, it can only be used as a short-term supply. Now is the beginning of the spring famine, and the situation in the future will be even more difficult. Therefore, we hope that the authorities will quickly continue the "Grain Storage Movement". In addition, the current authorities' food conservation movement is also very important, such as eating mixed grains or eating more porridge and cakes. With as many as six million people in this city, "accumulating sand into a tower," the amount of food that can be saved must be considerable. As for cracking down on grain merchants' profiteering or restricting the quantity of purchases, although it has some impact on grain prices, it is not a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Our country has always been a country that "establishes the nation on agriculture," and "people depend on food as their heaven" is a time-honored saying in our country, which shows the importance that rulers have always attached to the food problem. Originally, people's demand for food is indispensable for a single day, so the impact of food on people's livelihood is significantly greater than that of any other commodity. What's more, in order to suppress commodity prices, the cost of food prices (labor) has to first curb the unreasonable surge in grain prices. Only in this way can we stabilize social order. Otherwise, if the authorities allow the natural development of grain prices, it will affect public security and easily shake people's minds. The military authorities will announce today that the city has entered a state of war, and they should take practical and easy-to-implement emergency measures on how to suppress commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Shelling of British Warships: Britain Still Maintains a Cautious Attitude; Commonwealth Conference Considers it an Important Issue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st dispatch] The headline news in the evening editions of the local newspapers is still the incident of the British warships being attacked on the Yangtze River, but they all maintain a cautious attitude. Up to now, the government's attitude and the actions it has taken are limited to assisting the "Amethyst," a stricken vessel. At a press conference today, when reporters asked the Foreign Office spokesman about this matter, he declined to comment. After repeated prodding, the spokesman finally said: British warships do not have treaty rights to navigate on Chinese inland rivers, but they have obtained the consent of the Chinese government. When reporters asked whether the Communist Party commanders should have been notified in advance that British warships should know that they were already in the war zone, the spokesman said he did not know, but he also said that British warships have frequently traveled in the area since October last year, and the Communist Party must know that they are British warships. Regarding the news published in local newspapers that the British Consulate in Beiping has protested to the Communist authorities on the matter, the spokesman also refused to confirm it. At the same time, the Navy Department issued a statement at noon today stating that the HMS London and the HMS Black Swan could not approach the "Amethyst" due to heavy enemy fire. However, the statement also said: "Discreet measures are being taken to establish contact with enemy forces between the "Amethyst," the "London," and the "Black Swan" in order to ensure a smooth passage." The same statement also said: "The HMS Belfast and the HMS Constance are also sailing to Shanghai because they are needed to perform tasks in the area." However, this statement contradicts the Navy Department's next statement, which said: "The Belfast has not yet left Hong Kong."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st dispatch] The news that Communist artillery fire struck four British warships in the Yangtze River, killing 43 people and injuring 52, has shocked London. The Foreign Office was unable to confirm the news from China today, saying that Ambassador to China Steven had ordered the British Consul in Tianjin to protest to the Communist authorities about this "serious incident." Local diplomatic observers believe that this protest is tantamount to de facto recognition of the Mao Zedong government, and the United Kingdom does not intend to grant such recognition to the Communist Party at present, which is one of the reasons why British officials believe that the Yangtze River incident is difficult to resolve on the spot.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st dispatch] The incident of the Communist army shelling British warships on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been regarded as an important issue at the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference being held here. According to sources directly related to Southeast Asian affairs, they believe that the Communist army deliberately attacked British warships in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River for two reasons: (1) to force all foreign warships to withdraw from the Yangtze River; (2) to make the Asian people realize that the Communist Party has sufficient power to repel Western countries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st dispatch] According to sources close to the White House, President Truman's meeting with defense officials today focused on the Yangtze River incident of British warships being "shelled by the Communist army."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd dispatch] A British occupation army spokesman said on the 22nd that the army's air force in Japan is ready at any time, should the army receive an order to rescue British warships attacked by Communist artillery fire in the Yangtze River. The spokesman emphasized that the army has not yet received instructions.</p>
<p>[This city dispatch] Local British authorities denied yesterday's report by a foreign news agency that "Royal Air Force rocket combat aircraft attacking Malayan rebels have been put on standby to take possible action against the Communist army that shelled British warships on the Yangtze River." It is claimed that this report is completely inaccurate.</p>
<h3>The Artillery Used by the Communist Army Was Obtained from the Japanese Kwantung Army</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd dispatch] Well-informed sources here announced today that the artillery used by the Communist army to shell British warships was mostly obtained from the Japanese Kwantung Army. The Kwantung Army's 105mm caliber artillery is equipped with armor-piercing shells and tank-killing shells, which are the same as those that hit British warships. Its maximum range can reach 20,000 yards. The weight of the armor-piercing shell is unknown, but it is known that its firing speed is 2,500 feet per second. The Communist army entered the Northeast after the Soviet army defeated the Kwantung Army and obtained a large amount of ammunition and equipment. As far as is known here, the United States has never supplied the National Army with this military hardware.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Point Out that the Communist Side's Attack is a "Blatant Act of Aggression"</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st dispatch] The Conservative Party's Daily Mail said on the 21st that the Communist Party's attack on British warships on the Yangtze River was a "blatant act of aggression." The front-page editorial said: "Those killed are victims of murder. Britain must retaliate and demand punishment." The Mail asked: "How dare the Chinese attack our warships?" This kind of action would have been inconceivable even a few years ago. To find the answer, let us look at Singapore. The echoes of the fall of Singapore in 1942 still reverberate around the world, and its impact is still felt. A country that is weak and unwilling to exercise its rights is not respected in this world. We have said many times that might is still a reliable thing.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze Incident is Discussed in the United Nations Lounge</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 21st dispatch] In the United Nations lounge at Lake Success today, the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River and the resumption of the Communist army's offensive were the main topics of conversation. People from all walks of life in the United Nations, including the British, expressed the opinion that Britain has little chance of bringing the Communist army's shelling case to the Security Council or the International Court of Justice in The Hague, just like the incident where Japan laid mines in the Straits of Science, which later damaged British warships. Although the shelling occurred in the area ruled by the Nanjing government, the Nanjing government cannot be held responsible. Therefore, people close to the British delegation believe that the British government will first find out who is responsible. If it is clear that the Communist army opened fire, the British government seems to be going to lodge a strongly worded protest to the Communist authorities. (Please refer to page 4)</p>
<h3>A New Experiment in Reforming Chinese Characters: Zhang Zhongchuan Creates "Zhong Characters"</h3>
<p>Illiterate People Can Learn 4,000 Characters in Three Months</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Lanzhou, 22nd dispatch] The "Zhong Characters" invented by Anhui scholar Zhang Zhongchuan, after more than 20 years of research, have been completed, and he has written a book entitled "Suggestions for Zhong Characters," about 50,000 words, which will be submitted to the government for research, adoption, and promotion. "Zhong Characters" are a new experiment in the reform of Chinese characters, similar to Latinization, but with convenient, fixed, significant, and artistic conditions, so they are easy to read, easy to write, and easy to remember. They are more advanced than Latinized Mandarin and phonetic symbols. People who do not know a single character can learn 4,000 characters in three months by reading "Zhong Characters," which is extremely effective in eliminating illiteracy.</p>
<h3>Chennault Flew to America is Incorrect</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 21st dispatch] It was rumored that Chennault was flying from China to Washington, but it has been found that this is incorrect. Pan American Airlines is still investigating this news.</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Commodity Prices Plummet: Affected by Rumors of the Imminent Opening of Sino-Soviet Trade; Newly Minted Silver Coins Will Be Available on May 1</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Lanzhou, 22nd dispatch] It is reported that commodity prices in Xinjiang have recently plummeted, affected by rumors of the imminent opening of Sino-Soviet trade. Old-style gold scales in Dihua are 50 silver yuan per tael, and green frog cloth is only 5 silver yuan per bolt. Grain prices in southern Xinjiang, such as Kashi and Yarkand, are even lower, only 5 jiao in silver coins per 100 catties.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Lanzhou, 22nd dispatch] It is reported that Xinjiang's minting of silver coins is proceeding as planned, and they are expected to be available on May 1. After the new silver coins are circulated, in addition to issuing silver coin subsidiary currency at the same time, gold yuan and new provincial currency will still be used as usual.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Nolan Proposes Setting up a Joint Congressional Committee to Investigate U.S. Far East Policy; Truman Does Not Comment on the Situation in China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st dispatch] Republican Senator Nolan proposed in the Senate on the 21st to establish a joint congressional committee to investigate the United States' Far East policy. The committee will be composed of five representatives from each of the Senate and the House of Representatives to investigate the United States' Far East policy. The committee will be composed of five representatives from each of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The investigation funds are limited to 500,000 yuan. It is claimed: "The purpose of this move is to allow the American people to learn the truth and correct mistakes to the extent possible, so as not to be too late. Even at this moment of our meeting, the Communist army is crossing the Yangtze River and entering non-communist areas." Nolan accused the Secretary of State of recently writing to Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, opposing the 1.5 billion aid to China plan, which is a betrayal of non-communist China. It is claimed: "This kind of statement is tantamount to dismantling the stage for the Chinese National Government." It is also remembered that before World War II, the United States sold kerosene and scrap iron to Japan, and as a result, it was attacked by Japan, which shows that the State Department's foreign policy is not without errors. If the entire China falls into the hands of the Communist Party, Burma and French Vietnam, and even India, will fall behind the Iron Curtain. Once the entire Asian continent is controlled by the Communist army, it will be extremely difficult for Japan to maintain its freedom. If the United States does not abandon Japan at that time, it will only have to make Japan permanently dependent on the United States militarily and economically. The situation in China is bleak, I also admit, but its bleakness is not as bad as when the British army was defeated in Dunkirk in the early days of World War II. If the United States had adopted a defeatist attitude at that time, Britain would have been unable to support it, and the entire Europe would have fallen under the Nazi iron hooves at this moment.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st dispatch] McKee, Chairman of the newly established China Emergency Committee, denounced the State Department's publication of the amount of U.S. military aid to China on the 21st. After meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Webb, he told reporters that the Chinese government had only issued receipts for 105,400,000 yuan in U.S. aid. According to Acheson's statement on the 20th, U.S. military aid to China after the victory was 1 billion yuan. McKee said, "We believe that the United States has a large number of single-shot rifles and light equipment that are not suitable for Europe, which may change the situation in China."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st dispatch] President Truman was unwilling to comment on the situation in China on the 21st. However, according to the President's press secretary, Ross, the State Department is constantly reporting to the President on the developments in the Chinese civil war. Ross also said, "The President regularly receives reports on various developments in foreign countries, but as of now, he has not received any special reports on the situation in China."</p>
<h3>The U.S. Policy Towards China is a Dismal Failure</h3>
<p>Howard Newspaper Editorial Claims</p>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] New York, 22nd broadcast: An editorial in the Howard newspaper chain said that the State Department's policy towards China was a "dismal failure." The editorial said: If the Truman administration's policy towards China has nothing to hide, then it should humbly accept Senator Lander's proposal to demand that Congress conduct a comprehensive review of U.S. policy towards China. We should do everything we can to save this crisis. The editorial also said: The United States adopts an open bipartisan policy towards Europe, while decision-making on Asian issues is kept secret for fear that Congress and the public will learn the details, which is the style of totalitarian countries, not the attitude that the United States should have.</p>
<h3>Western Hunan's Yuanling Tensions Rise Again; Chen Quzhen Sends a Letter to Cheng Qian Expressing His Unwillingness to Come Out of Retirement; He Offers Three Opinions on Handling the Western Hunan Issue</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Changsha, 22nd dispatch] The situation in the Yixianpu area northwest of Yuanling is unknown because the telegrams between Yuan and Wu (Su) have been destroyed by bandits. In addition, the rebel troops attacking Yuan have drilled into Xiaojiashan, Xiangjiacun, and the Baitiantou area three miles away from Yuan North. It has been discovered that there are about 2,000 bandits from the Wang Yuanhua, Li Lanchu, and Xiang Kewu factions, and Yuanling is becoming tense again. The National Army is transferring powerful troops from Changde to block and suppress them.</p>

<h3>Acheson Attends Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Explains US Military Aid Plan; Requires $1.45 Billion in Funds; Includes Expenses for Aid to Greece and Turkey</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 21st] Secretary of State Acheson submitted a $1.45 billion military aid bill to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today. This figure of $1.45 billion accounts for approximately the total amount of US military aid, including military aid to Greece and Turkey for the 1950 fiscal year. According to Acheson's statement to the committee, military aid to the signatory nations of the North Atlantic Treaty will amount to $1.12 billion, including the transfer of equipment and surplus materials and the shipment of raw materials from the United States. The remaining $320 million will be allocated to Greece and Turkey. According to Senator Connally, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the committee will begin discussing the North Atlantic Treaty on the 28th. The President will formally present the military aid bill at the conclusion of this discussion. Before this, the committee will temporarily refrain from discussing the military aid bill.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] According to Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the total amount of funds for aid to Greece and Turkey, countries outside the Atlantic signatory nations, is $320 million. The Philippines may also receive a small amount of grants. If the military aid plan is passed, it will be inseparable from US foreign policy. The Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to discuss the full text of the North Atlantic Treaty next Thursday. The treaty must be passed by a two-thirds majority in the Senate to take effect.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Definite indications revealed on the 21st that the US government does not intend to request military aid to China in this session of Congress. This revelation came as Secretary of State Acheson submitted a request to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for $1.13 billion in military aid to the North Atlantic Treaty nations and $320 million in military aid to Greece and Turkey. This plan is called the "Comprehensive Military Aid Program for 1950." When announcing the request of the Economic Cooperation Administration, the government stated that the aid programs for Greece, Turkey, and China would be submitted to Congress later. Although the announcement on the 21st apparently excluded military aid to China, additional reconstruction aid may be proposed later.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Republican leaders and others believed on the 22nd that the information given to Congress regarding the $1.45 billion plan to assist in arming Europe and other free nations against Communist aggression was not yet sufficient. Senator Taft, the Republican leader in the Senate, stated that Secretary of State Acheson had only given Congress another figure. He advocated a "complete break" with the proposed military aid plan. Taft, a Republican policy planner, stated that Congress's requirements cannot be satisfied solely by cost estimates. He stated that before Congress handles the approval of the Atlantic Treaty, it must first know all the details of the military aid plan.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The British Commonwealth Prime Ministers began their first plenary meeting today to begin searching for a new formula to allow India to continue to maintain relations with the British Commonwealth. Leaders and politicians from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, India, Palestine, and Ceylon will deal within a week with new issues that could completely change the future Commonwealth relationship.</p>
<p>The representatives of the countries concerned drove to No. 10 Downing Street this morning to attend the first round table meeting. One hour before the meeting, Prime Minister Attlee convened a meeting of key cabinet members. This meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers is a closed door meeting. First, Mandeville delivered a welcome speech, then invited Indian Prime Minister Nehru to report on India's views on Commonwealth relations.

<h3>Attlee and Nehru Hold Secret Talks for One and a Half Hours; Differing Opinions Among Prime Ministers on British-Indian Relations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Prime Minister Attlee has held individual talks with various Prime Ministers in the past two days, and today he held a separate secret talk with Indian Prime Minister Nehru for 90 minutes. Special telephone lines have also been installed at the hotels where the various Prime Ministers are staying. The main purpose of this meeting is to find a formula that will allow India to continue to cooperate with the British Commonwealth without compromising its future independent republic status. Several possible formulas have been proposed, but India and other participating countries do not have preconceived notions. The status of the British monarch in the Commonwealth will also be a major issue. Some countries believe that the British monarch is an indispensable link between the Commonwealth countries, but others believe that the link based on the British monarch is no longer acceptable to them. How to reconcile these two opinions is one of the main tasks of this meeting. This morning, Prime Minister Attlee held a garden party at his official residence to entertain the Prime Ministers, and at noon the Prime Ministers entered Buckingham Palace to attend a banquet hosted by the British King and Queen. This meeting is scheduled to continue for about a week.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] Well-informed sources believe that the current Assistant Secretary of the Army Gray will be promoted to Secretary of the Army. Gray owns several newspapers in North Carolina. Rumors of Royal's impending resignation have been circulating for months.

On April 1, Royal sent another letter to the President declining his retention, and on April 21, the President accepted his request. Royal will return to practicing law after leaving office.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] According to Royal, there was no public conflict between him and President Truman, but he has never been able to reconcile with the President's policy of eliminating racial discrimination in the military.

<h3>Soviet Writer Fadeyev Criticizes the Atlantic Treaty; Accuses the US of Building a Military Base Ring Around the World</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union's chief representative, the famous writer Fadeyev, addressed the conference, saying that he did not believe that war was imminent, but that war had become a possibility due to the arms race of Western countries. He also said that the atomic bomb cannot be regarded as a defensive weapon, its role is to destroy cities and unarmed civilians. Fadeyev also said: The Atlantic Treaty is obviously dividing the world into two opposing blocs. The day these military blocs are formed is the day that war has entered the preparatory stage. Just open a world map and you will know that the United States has built military rings all over the world, forming a threat to world peace.</p>
<h3>Ehrenburg's Speech: The Soviet Union Cherishes Peace; The Voice of Peace Cannot Be Suppressed</h3>

<h3>Violation of Treaty Issues; Hungary and Romania Reply; Fails to Satisfy the US</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 21st] Earlier this month, the US government sent a note to Romania, accusing the country of violating the provisions of the treaty concerning human rights. The US government has now received a "completely unsatisfactory" reply. The State Department said that the US has also received Hungary's reply to a similar note, and this reply is also equally unsatisfactory. The United States is now awaiting a reply from Bulgaria, the third Balkan country and former German satellite state. After Bulgaria submits its reply, the US government will consult with other signatories to the treaty for further action. The notes from the US and Britain to the governments of the three countries listed facts of violations of the treaty and accused the countries of deliberately taking various measures that directly violated the treaty. The notes requested that remedial action be taken and that the US and Britain be notified of such action. The notes also stated that the US and Britain would not accept a reply that this was purely an internal matter. Since the Soviet Union (one of the three important signatories to the treaty) has not taken consistent action with the US and Britain, it will not consult with the Soviet government on this matter unless the efforts of other signatories fail.</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Disposing of Former Italian Colonies; US and Soviet Representatives Engage in Heated Debate; The US Consistently Opposes Handing Over to UN Trusteeship; The Soviet Union Accuses the US and Britain of Attempting to Use Them as Bases</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 21st] During today's debate on the issue of former Italian colonies at the UN Political Committee, a dispute arose between the US and Soviet representatives. US Representative Dulles declared that the United States "believes that African land cannot be handed over to countries attempting to prove that the communist form of society is the only form." Dulles was responding to the accusations of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko that Britain and the United States were obstructing the Soviet Union's proposal to hand over former Italian African colonies to the direct trusteeship of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Dulles emphasized that the Soviet Union would also participate in the United Nations' trusteeship, and therefore asked whether it was fair to hand over the fate of African residents to a divided United Nations. Dulles accused the Soviet Union of being responsible for the inability to reach an agreement on Italian colonies. He stated that the 1945 London Conference reached a stalemate because the Soviet Union demanded trusteeship of Tripolitania "when Soviet troops did not participate in the liberation of Libya."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 21st] The UN Political Committee continued its discussion on the Italian colonies issue today. Soviet Representative Gromyko strongly condemned the attempts of Britain and the United States to divide the former Italian colonies and hand them over to Britain, the United States, Italy, and Abyssinia for partition. He said that the Italian colonies under British rule were deteriorating and that Britain and the United States were obstructing an agreement on the Italian colonies issue at the Foreign Ministers' Conference because Britain and the United States wanted to use these lands to achieve their selfish military strategic goals. He said that the remarks of US Representative Dulles represented the US General Staff. Britain is extracting valuable materials in the Italian colonies under its rule and neglecting the education of the residents. The attitude of British rule in the colonies can be seen in general by observing the remarks of India. Gromyko said that the Soviet Union's proposals on Italian colonies were entirely based on the interests of the local residents.</p>
<h3>Australia Deeply Wary of Japan; Japan Will Re-Arm After a New War Breaks Out; Will Come Up With Another Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Melbourne, 21st] Australian Immigration Minister Calwell said in a speech to the Royal Imperial Association today: When the Third World War breaks out, the United States may use Britain and Japan as "aircraft carriers". As a result, Japan will re-arm and its industry will be rebuilt. The issue for Australia will be who will again carry out the task of disarming Japan. Japan will quickly become Australia's rival, and will undoubtedly come up with another Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Plan. Calwell also said: Australia needs at least ten years and at most 25 years to prepare for another war. Australia needs a population of 25 million to develop and maintain Australia, so Australia must obtain such a population within at most 25 years.</p>
<h3>America's Strategy</h3>
<p>— Translated by this Newspaper's Editorial Department</p>
<p>America has encountered another difficulty. It has promised too much to the nations of the world, while in reality being able to do too little. America promised to defend the entire Western Hemisphere, promised to send supplies to others, and promised to guarantee the military security of others. Now, it cannot help but discount these promises. The person responsible for "discounting" is General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in wartime Europe. His official title is Special Advisor to the U.S. Secretary of Defense, and he serves as chairman when the Joint Chiefs of Staff hold meetings.</p>
<p>With the Far Eastern situation changing to its current stage, the United States has apparently decided to temporarily cease sending large amounts of money and troops to Asia. General MacArthur in Japan now knows that the United States is not prepared to further strengthen its military forces in Japan. Just like the Second World War, the main battlefield of the "Cold War" is Europe. If the "Cold War" turns into a "Hot War," the main battlefield will still be in Europe.</p>
<p>In Europe, although the Scandinavian countries and Italy are important, they are considered secondary in the current assessment. The United States has decided to prioritize spending money in areas where it can achieve the greatest effect.</p>
<p>The U.S. military has decided to focus on the Atlantic and temporarily relax its grip on the Pacific. The Navy has announced the closure of eleven naval air stations in the Pacific region. China has been shelved, and Japan is no longer being reconstructed from a military standpoint. The main U.S. defense bases in the Pacific region will now be Okinawa and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The Marshall Plan for European recovery has been decided to continue on its previous scale, with the aim of making these countries completely self-sufficient by 1952. The United States will continue to aid West Germany, so that it can gradually achieve a status similar to that of other non-communist countries in Europe. However, even with these plans, the burden of the United States overseas is already considerable. Therefore, President Truman has requested General Eisenhower's assistance to formulate a basic national defense strategy.</p>
<p>The main goal of the defense of the United States and other European countries is, of course, to deter the Soviet threat. According to Eisenhower, if a war is fought against the Soviet Union, the decisive battlefield will be Europe. Currently, the Western countries have about fifteen divisions in Europe, of which only seven are capable of combat, while the Soviet Union has as many as fifty to sixty divisions in East Germany alone, and can add another hundred divisions to the fighting within a few weeks. According to the estimates of American military experts, given such a disparity in forces, the Soviet army could indeed reach Gibraltar after a relatively short offensive. Therefore, they believe that Western European countries must build strong military forces in order to talk about security.</p>
<p>Before building these military forces, the primary question is: What kind of army should be built? Eisenhower is here to help the government answer these questions.</p>
<p>Of course, military experts have different opinions. Some advocate using atomic bombs. They say that in a war against the Soviet Union, air warfare should be relied upon. The U.S. military can use long-range aircraft to fly directly from the United States to Soviet cities and industrial areas to drop atomic bombs. Air Force experts say that the new American super bombers can fly extremely high and extremely fast, making the Soviet army helpless. However, opponents say that even if the United States has a large number of these new aircraft, there is still the question of whether the bombardiers can hit their targets when dropping atomic bombs at high altitude. Moreover, when bombing Moscow and Leningrad, perhaps it is not only Soviet people who will be killed, but also French people or other Western European civilians who have been captured by the Soviet army as hostages. Moreover, if the Soviet army launches a sudden attack, perhaps the U.S. troops currently stationed in Germany will become these hostages and become victims of atomic bombs.</p>
<p>Some advocate using bombing to cut off the Soviet army's rear lines of communication, isolating the front-line Soviet troops. However, cutting off 1,200 miles of communication lines is a rather difficult task. Military strategists believe that it is not easy to do in practice, especially since the Soviet side also has fighter planes for defense.</p>
<p>General MacArthur believes that Europe and Asia should be considered equally important. He believes that Japan can be used as a base to attack eastern Siberia. However, Washington's view is that the U.S. military should concentrate on Europe and take a defensive stance in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Navy advocates making full use of aircraft carriers, so that planes can take off from the carriers and fly to the Soviet Union to drop atomic bombs. Aircraft carriers are flexible to use and difficult for the Soviet army to defend against. However, since the main battlefield is in Western Europe, the use of aircraft carriers can only be in a supporting role.</p>
<p>All of these opinions are being carefully studied, and the final plan adopted may include a little of each.</p>
<p>However, the main effort now is to build a ground force in Western Europe. The new army's equipment will particularly emphasize how to deal with the Soviet army's famous heavy tanks and artillery. Experts say that the new army should be equipped with automatic-firing anti-tank guns, supplemented by a strong air force. Much of this equipment can be obtained from U.S. military surplus. The U.S. General Staff has begun to sort it out, preparing to send it to Europe. According to current estimates, military equipment worth about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars will be sent to Europe in the first year. Most of these weapons will be sent to France and Belgium, because if the Soviet army launches a sudden attack, these two countries will be in the most dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Military strategists are considering many troublesome issues. For example, it is difficult to say to what extent the Western European armies will be willing to fight if the Soviet army invades. In addition, if the Soviet Union believes that war is inevitable and launches a preemptive strike to occupy all of Western Europe, then the military equipment that the United States sends to Western Europe will run the risk of falling entirely into the hands of the Soviet army. At that time, the United States will have to start manufacturing military equipment again.</p>
<p>However, American civil officials familiar with the situation in the Soviet Union believe that the possibility of this danger is extremely small. They say that although the Soviet Union is loudly opposing the North Atlantic Treaty, it will not take too extreme actions that would provoke a third world war.

<p>[United Press Dispatch] The British 10,000-ton cruiser "London" sailed to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River yesterday to rescue the stranded British warship "Amethyst" and was heavily shelled by the Communist army, turning back to Shanghai. A United Press reporter visited the ship today and saw two shell hits on the ship's hull, one on the starboard side and one on the second front turret. There were small shell marks on the chimney. The entire crew was extremely calm, but seemed very tired. Commander Cassalle refused to announce the number of casualties and the names of the dead and wounded, but according to the US Navy authorities who helped rescue the wounded, 23 wounded soldiers were sent to the hospital (British sources say 20 were injured). According to an officer on the ship, the "London" was fortunate to turn back yesterday. If it had continued to move forward, it would have been suicide. The Communist army seemed to have artillery batteries every two or three feet along the coast. Also, the "Black Swan" also turned back with the "London" yesterday and docked next to the "London." There were shell marks on the port side, and one of the oil depots had been penetrated, but fortunately it did not catch fire.</p>
<p>Our Pilot Killed by Gunfire</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch] When the British cruiser London was shelled by the Communist army on the 21st, a Chinese pilot was hit by shrapnel and died instantly. There were eighteen holes in the port side of the London's hull, and five holes in the starboard side. The largest hole was nearly thirty inches in diameter.</p>
<p>Number of Casualties on British Ships</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch] British naval authorities announced last night that 42 sailors had been confirmed dead as a result of the Communist army's shelling of British ships in recent days. The "London" had 15 dead, the "Consort" had 10 dead, and the "Amethyst" had 17 dead. More than 35 soldiers were injured, including 20 on the "London," 5 on the "Black Swan," 10 on the "Consort," and the number of injured on the "Amethyst" is still unknown.</p>

<h3>The Process of Exposing Rice Shop Fraud is Very Interesting, A Thirteen-Year-Old Girl Has Wisdom, Unforgettable at First Sight, Finds Material Evidence, Manager Zhang is Finally Interrogated and Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Zhang Binggui, a native of Chongming, is the manager of Tianfu Rice Shop at No. 60 Chongqing Middle Road in the city. He was accused of corruption and fraud in handling household rice by Zhang Zipin and Zhang Xueyun, citizens of the district. The case was investigated and prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office and the first trial was held in the District Court by Judge Guo Zugan. The hearing was adjourned, as it was deemed necessary to review the account books. Many citizens of the district came to listen, as they had repeatedly been refused when purchasing household rice from the shop, on the grounds that the rice had been sold out or was out of date, resulting in considerable losses. According to the investigation, the process of exposing the case was very interesting. The details are as follows, as investigated by the reporter: On the morning of October 2nd last year, at around 7:00 AM, Tianfu Rice Shop mixed the remaining three stones and seven dou of household rice from September of the same year into five stones of self-purchased indica rice and sold it to Lüzhonghe Rice Shop on Xinwen Road. When the rice was being loaded and transported through the back door, it was discovered by local residents, who stopped it. The incident alarmed the police who came to interfere. The shop argued with the police officers while taking advantage of the gaps to transport the rice away in an attempt to destroy the evidence. At that time, someone called the Lujiawan Sub-bureau. Upon hearing the news, the police bureau ordered someone to investigate. By this time, the residents had dispersed, and only a thirteen-year-old girl, Zhang Xueyun, volunteered to testify about what she had personally witnessed. The police officers invited Zhang and her father to the bureau to testify. Unexpectedly, the little girl suddenly left without saying goodbye. The police officers did not pay attention to it at first, thinking that she was timid and afraid to go to the bureau. However, not long after, the police bureau suddenly received a call from her, saying that she had seized the rice transported by Tianfu Rice Shop and asked them to go to the bureau to transport it as evidence. Because she was young and intelligent, she had seen Lüzhonghe Rice Shop when passing Xinzhala Road on her way to school on weekdays, and the impression remained in her mind. That morning, when she saw that the rice sacks transported by Tianfu had the Lüzhonghe brand, she suddenly remembered the previous matter and knew that if there was no material evidence when reporting to the police, the crime could not be established. Therefore, she hired a tricycle to rush to Xinzhala Road. Because it was still early, Lüzhonghe had not yet opened, and the collapse of the Tianfu Rice Shop transport vehicle was slow, so it had not yet arrived. Therefore, as soon as it arrived, she identified it. After the police transported it to the bureau as evidence, the patrol officer from the sub-bureau obtained a cup of rice for matching, which was similar to the rice sold to Lüzhonghe. At this point, Zhang confessed to selling household rice privately. However, after Zhang was released on bail and returned to the shop, he transported four stones of mixed rice to Zhenxingguan Hotel using the same method the next day. Zhang heard this and was even more indignant, so he reported to the District Prosecutor's Office. The District Prosecutor's Office sent a judicial police officer to investigate and handle the matter. Zhang, unable to hide anything, also confessed that five dou of the four stones were household rice. However, he submitted a statement arguing that the household rice was swapped with other rice and that the sale was not illegal. The District Prosecutor's Office inquired with the People's Mediation Committee and received a reply stating that the household rice allocated to each grain distribution store by the office must be issued with a certificate, and there is no way to allow separate sales. Based on this, the District Prosecutor's Office believed that the evidence of Zhang's crime was extremely clear and could not be denied, so he was prosecuted.</p>

<h3>Public Utility Pricing, Municipal Government Revises Measures, Water, Electricity, Gas, and Telephone Charges Will Be Adjusted Daily According to Prices, Public Transportation Fares Will Be Adjusted Every Five Days, The Council's Public Utilities Group Will Hold Another Meeting Today to Decide</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to protect the public utility companies in the city, the Municipal Government has revised the public utility pricing measures. (1) For the four items of water, electricity, gas, and telephone, the original base number is still used, and the daily price index published by the Central Bank is used for adjustment. Users will uniformly calculate and pay according to the index on the payment date. If they are willing to prepay, the company should accept it and will not be affected by price adjustments during the prepayment period, but it is limited to one month's usage. (2) For public transportation businesses, part of the measures will refer to the above methods, and adjustments will be made every five days on a trial basis. However, transportation businesses are fundamentally different from water, electricity, gas, and telephone in that the higher the price, the fewer the passengers, and the income still cannot cover the expenses. Therefore, the only remedy is to request the Central Bank to increase the loan for public transportation businesses on the original amount to meet the companies' needs for one month's power costs (including oil, coal, electricity, etc.) and salary expenses, and it must be repaid by each company in full on the last day of each month. Furthermore, at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, an emergency meeting was held in the Municipal Government Conference Room, co-chaired by Secretary-General Chen Liang, attended by City Council Speaker Pan, Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhang Rentao, Councilors Jiang Hao, Jiang Haoran, Chen Peide, Qu Cheng, Ye Fenghu, and the heads of various public utility companies in the city, Simpson, Pollock, and others, totaling more than 30 people.</p>
<p>Currency Depreciation Accelerates, Company Losses Increase</p>
<p>First, Secretary-General Chen elaborated on the significance of the meeting, stating that public utility prices are adjusted twice a month, while prices rise several times a day, and the company's business will inevitably be unsustainable. We must seek proper rescue methods, otherwise, once water and electricity are cut off, social order will be disrupted, and production will be halted, so we must plan a solution in advance. Then, Director Zhang reported on the Municipal Government's proposed revision of pricing measures and the economic difficulties of various companies, stating that the public utility pricing and charging measures in the city are adjusted according to the multiple of the cost of living index determined by the City Council. However, due to the accelerating depreciation of the currency and the monthly jumps in prices and exchange rates, the March revenue of each company accounted for only about 33% to 56% of the expenditure, which shows that the revenue and expenditure losses of each company have reached an extremely serious level. The British Tramway Company Pollock once sent a letter to the Public Utilities Bureau stating that the company's losses were too great and could only be maintained until May 15. 100 million yuan, but the daily average income is only 100 million yuan, and on the 5th, it can only earn 1.4 billion yuan. In addition to requesting the Central Bank to relax the loan scale to maintain it, there is no other way to follow.</p>
<p>Under the Serious Burden, It is Really Difficult to Cope</p>
<p>Then, Speaker Pan delivered a speech stating that in the new fiscal and financial reform plan promulgated by the government, tax revenue is adjusted according to customs yuan and price index, and workers have also requested to be paid in silver dollars. It is really difficult for the company to cope under these two burdens. The citizens' enjoyment of public utilities should have a reasonable burden to maintain the business of each company, otherwise, once water and electricity are cut off, it is equivalent to helping the Communists destroy Shanghai, so revising the pricing measures is indeed urgent.</p>
<p>Finally, Councilors Jiang Hao, Qu Cheng, Ye Fenghu, and others successively expressed their opinions, unanimously agreeing that maintaining public utilities is important, but the lives of citizens must also be taken into account, because citizens' income is in gold yuan coupons, and their expenses have been calibrated in silver dollars. If public utility prices are adjusted monthly, citizens will really not be able to bear it, so they believe that the government should support public utilities with its greatest strength and relax the loan scale, and restore the subsidy policy. The meeting decided to hold a meeting of the City Council's Public Utilities Subcommittee at 3:00 PM today to make a decision and submit it to the City Council for approval and implementation, and to invite senior officials from the Central Bank and various public utility companies to attend for explanation.</p>
<h3>A Tragic Change in a Family on Fanyu Road, West Shanghai, A Biological Mother Forces Her Own Daughter to Take Poison Out of Jealousy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a tragic case of a biological mother forcing her own daughter out of jealousy occurred at No. 15, Lane 209, Fanyu Road, West Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fei Aisi, a 37-year-old woman from Beiping, graduated from the National Central Senior Nurse Vocational School. She worked as a nurse in a hospital in Beiping and married Wang Jingxi, with whom she had a daughter named Qingyun, who is now twenty years old. At first, Fei entrusted her daughter to her mother to raise, while she lived with Wang. Later, the two divorced due to emotional disagreements. Fei then came to Shanghai and remarried Shen Renjie, a native of Zhejiang and the director of medical affairs at the Central Printing Paper Factory in the city, through introductions, and they had two sons and one daughter. In June last year, Fei brought her daughter Qingyun back from Beiping to live with her. Shen saw that the girl was graceful and often approached her, which aroused Fei's suspicion, and she often beat and humiliated her daughter. Recently, Fei had a younger sister named Clara, who came to Shanghai from Taiwan with her maid Jiang Jianzhen and stayed at her home. She often saw her sister beating and humiliating her daughter and advised her to leave temporarily. It was originally scheduled to be sent to her younger sister in Qingdao by Fei's sister on the same day. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, before Fei's sister went out to buy boat tickets, she was afraid that an accident would happen and asked the maid Jiang Xian to pay attention at all times. Unexpectedly, after 9:30, Fei Aisi became vicious and summoned her daughter, tightly closing the door. She took out a cup of black liquid medicine and told her daughter to drink it, and then took out a cup of white liquid medicine and told her daughter to drink it again. The daughter begged for mercy, but Fei's mother refused. While struggling, the maid Jiang Xianzhen heard it, peeked through the crack in the window, and learned the truth. She urgently reported to the Facao Police Station, and Section Chief Shi Jieren ordered Section Members Zhu Yunzhang, Cadre Li Zonglan, Chen Xianzhong, and others to rush to the scene. Fei's daughter was already in a coma. They quickly flew her to the First Hospital of the Red Cross for treatment and detained her mother. After learning the facts, the bureau is continuing its investigation.</p>
<h3>Bribery Case of Patrol Sergeant and Police Officer, Only One Person Appeared in Court for Retrial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Hongkou Sub-bureau Patrol Sergeant Yan Xuehui, while on duty on November 1 last year, accepted a bribe because someone was transporting dirty goods and distributed the bribe to police officers Lou Rui, You Fengchi, Ling Yunxiao, Wei Ping, etc. by 10 yuan, 20 yuan, etc. The next day, Lou and You reported the information to the sub-bureau chief and sent the 30 gold yuan given by Yan for review and handling. As a result, Yan Ling and Wei were investigated. In the District Court's judgment on December 6, Yan was sentenced to five years in prison, and the cases of Ling and Wei were not accepted. Yan refused to accept the judgment and applied for retrial. After Yan and Ling were released on bail, they fled. The High Court then sent the case back to the District Court for retrial. It is said that Yan and Ming both refused to appear in court. Wei responded to questioning several times. Judge Ye Guiling retried the case in the District Court yesterday, and it is said that Wei's case will be sentenced to more than seven years in prison according to law. After the defense lawyer repeatedly requested, Judge Ye approved the postponement of the sentencing to the 26th to find more powerful rebuttal evidence, hoping to reduce Wei's culpability.</p>
<h3>Two Cases of Gambling Bust in Pudong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Recently, gambling has been rampant in the Pudong area, with US dollars, silver dollars, and white rice used as bets. It is rumored that they are colluding with a certain agency. A complaint was made to the Municipal Police Headquarters. Chief Mao paid great attention, and Inspector Xu Guang of the First Inspectorate District also heard about it. He disguised himself as an inspector yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM and led inspectors Li Hua and Li Guangwu and two squads of police officers dispatched by Chief Han of the Security Police Brigade. At Huayuanshi Bridge, they arrested 19 gamblers, including Zhu Zhenwen and Ding Guoming. They seized one dragon gate gambling device, ten dice, 49 chips, and three ledgers of gambling money. They also arrested eight gamblers, including Song Jinke and You Guixian, at Yangjiadu, as well as gambling money, mahjong tiles, chips, etc. All the gamblers and gambling equipment were handed over to the Yangjing Sub-bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>News from Anqing</h3>
<p>— Our reporter, Liu Zao</p>
<p>Preparedness for War and Seeking Peace: Wu Zhongjian</p>
<p>Pengze is a small county town of mountains and waters. During the Jin Dynasty,</p>
<p>Mr. Five Willows</p>
<p>once served as the county magistrate. Therefore, there are still Five Willows Township, Five Willows Hall, and various historical sites commemorating Tao Yuanming. If not for this Anqing battle, outsiders would probably have few opportunities to enter this city. Although it is located on the riverside, the ships traveling between Shanghai and Hankou do not stop here, and even cars do not use it as a main line stop. However, those who travel through Pengze are attracted by the solitary Xiaogu Mountain in the heart of the river, considering it a scenic spot. Thus, the once-famous hometown of Mr. Five Willows, Pengze, is forgotten.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the war, most of the original residents have moved away. The remaining common people number less than 3,000 in the entire city. The only restaurant is quite busy catering to the soldiers passing through. However, for newcomers, finding a hotel or renting a small shop here is like climbing to the sky because there are no hotels or inns in the whole city to accommodate guests. The only option for the commanders here is to mingle with the common people. I, as a reporter, had to painstakingly negotiate with Lao Yan, the restaurant owner, for accommodation during my trip to Pengze. Only then did I manage to secure a space, renting a dilapidated bed with lice-infested cotton wadding for one night, costing five jiao in silver dollars or one hundred and fifty copper coins (commonly known as copper notes). — One silver dollar can be exchanged for three hundred copper coins; gold yuan coupons are redundant currency here.</p>
<p>Xiaogu Mountain, also known as Xiaogu Hill, is located approximately eight li downstream from Pengze in the heart of the river, within the territory of Wangjiang, Anhui Province. I, as a reporter, returned from Anqing this time.</p>
<p>While passing through Pengze, due to the insistence of the garrison division commander Zhang Xunting and Chief of Staff Dong Ziliang to stay for a day, I ascended Xiaogu Mountain with Chief of Staff Dong on the 15th to fulfill a long-held wish. Just as we were using binoculars to view the distant scenery north of the river, we suddenly discovered Communist troops' guard units in Liu Family Row, Shanghuayuan, and other places three li from the mountain's base. Immediately, a platoon leader of the mountain garrison, carrying a "60" mortar, placed it next to the "Xiaogu" dressing pavilion and fired one shot, two shots... across the river. There was no response. After waiting a while, the plainclothes scouts reported that there were indeed over five hundred Communist troops hiding in the villages in Liu Family Row and other places, attempting to move westward.</p>
<p>Pengze is designated by the Ministry of National Defense as a model county for civilian training. Currently, the civilian training work in Pengze is not proceeding according to plan due to its proximity to the front line, the military's need for supplies, and the people's difficult and uneasy lives. Moreover, the current Pengze has a complex system of military and political jurisdiction. Politically, it originally belonged to the 16th Pacification Zone; militarily, it now belongs to the 4th Army Corps; transportation belongs to the 8th Pacification Zone. The county magistrate's superiors include these three military organs, as well as his direct superiors—the provincial government, the commissioner's office, and the provincial security headquarters.</p>
<p>Another serious problem, which may not be entirely unique to Pengze, is</p>
<p>the supplementary funding for the garrison's non-staple food expenses. For a Pengze that is impoverished to the point of destitution, supplying a division's non-staple food deficit and borrowing staple food is truly unaffordable. Moreover, in addition to this, there are many unavoidable public and private supplies.</p>
<p>D渡口 (D渡口) is the "stepping stone" to Anqing. In normal times, it is just a small river crossing town, but now it has become a bustling little street with hotels, restaurants, and Western-style tailors, etc. Some come from the rear, others return from the front. Car drivers are the most proud here; coming from Pengze, it is indispensable; going to the rear, it is indispensable. A "yellow croaker" fish costs four silver dollars in Pengze, at least two.</p>
<p>The prices here are twice as high as in Pengze. A small room costs one silver dollar per night, and a meal with one dish and one soup costs five jiao. If one cannot reach Anqing smoothly before 5 PM, even finding a place to stay for the night becomes a big problem.</p>
<p>Nine days ago, people at D渡口 were</p>
<p>bombed once by Communist aircraft. I, as a reporter, specially interviewed several friends working here. They admitted that a bomb really fell at D渡口 that day, injuring twelve people, but causing no deaths. As for the markings of the aircraft, they could not be identified because they were flying at high altitude. According to the front-line report on that day, there were six aircraft in formation flying over Qipanshan in the eastern suburbs of Anqing, cooperating with the defending troops in the front line. It happened that Deputy Regiment Commander of 口口 Division and three reporters from Anqing's Xinmin and other newspapers were inspecting the positions on Qipanshan when they were hit by an aircraft bomb and injured. The three companions were also slightly injured. After a while, news of a bombing at D渡口 also came. After inquiries to Nanjing, it was learned that the bombing was due to a malfunction in the bomb rack of one of the aircraft, causing the bomb to be dropped. Therefore, the mystery of the widespread rumor of Communist aircraft bombing D渡口 was solved! According to the defending division commander Wu Zhongjian, no Communist aircraft have been found cooperating in combat on the Anqing front.</p>
<p>Anqing under seven general offensives by the Communist army, the National Army's position, as stable as Mount Tai, is a miracle. This is the achievement of the military loving the people and the people supporting the military. The so-called "miracle" is that the defending troops defeated a Communist army with more than five times their strength with</p>
<p>inferior forces, defeating the Communist army's 11th Army and an independent division, as well as a cadre regiment and an independent brigade, and achieving a casualty ratio of 20 to 1. The National Army had the advantage. The achievement of this "miracle" is, of course, due to military-civilian coordination and combined operations of the army, navy, and air force.</p>
<p>The street stalls in Anqing city reflect the people's war life. They still quietly live their lives under the noise of artillery fire.</p>
<p>Qian Zhendong, the magistrate of Huaining (i.e., Anqing) County, was originally the speaker of the county council. On the eve of taking office, he did not know there was such a thing. On the evening of March 23, the provincial government withdrew, and the former county magistrate, Zeng, could not withstand the threat of war. He ran to D渡口 with his people and seals. It was a chaotic and tense situation, and Deputy County Magistrate Hu Mengsong handed over the seals on his behalf. Therefore, County Magistrate Qian dared to shoulder this responsibility. It can be considered</p>
<p>accepting a mission in a time of crisis. He said: Can the people of Anqing say no today?</p>
<p>National "Anhui University," because the campus is located in the eastern suburbs of the city near the battlefield, has been suspended. Most of the more than 800 faculty and students have left Anqing. There are still more than 200 people stranded in the city. For them, studying is certainly impossible, and even two meals a day may soon become a problem, because President Yang Lianggong has long gone to Beijing. In this sudden change, what can be done to rescue this group of faculty and students who are deeply trapped in the artillery fire from distant Nanjing? Therefore, the faculty and staff formed a school affairs maintenance committee, and the students formed an emergency response committee. For the sake of livelihood, they also set up street stalls, placing their only few tattered books and torn clothes on the open space in front of the Commissioner's Park, letting people choose. This is the misfortune of the education sector and a satire on the local government.</p>
<p>Some of the secondary and higher schools in the city have relocated, while others are still holding classes. Some primary schools are also holding classes, which is commendable.</p>
<p>What is admirable is the several newspaper offices in the city. Although under the artillery fire of more than 20 days of bitter fighting, there are still three newspapers, Evening News, Xinmin News, and Xinmin Duo News, continuing to publish. Because the streets are under curfew after 8 PM every night, and passage is not allowed, they have changed to publishing noon newspapers. Except for the telecommunications department, which still copies broadcasts on time, the personnel of the compilation and editing departments start work every morning, constantly providing the troops and civilians on the Anqing front line with accurate reports on the front-line battles, the peace talks that everyone cares about, and national events. Their publication has had considerable success in encouraging morale and stabilizing public sentiment. Unfortunately, the distribution range of each newspaper is limited to the small circle of the city and D渡口. The total distribution of the three newspapers is only about 1,000 copies. In the past, Jiujiang's Xingbao Newspaper had a large market in Anqing, Wangjiang, Susong, Taihu, etc. Now, it is also cut off due to the war. When I, as a reporter, went to Anqing this time, Hu Shijue, the publisher of Xingbao Newspaper, specially entrusted me to bring 100 copies of the newspaper to distribute to the defending troops and the people of Anhui in the city to express his condolences.</p>
<p>According to the county government's investigation, there are currently 70,000 people in Anqing City, a decrease of about 20,000 to 30,000 compared to before the start of this defensive battle. However, with the addition of a division and attached troops, as well as refugees stranded from other counties, the total population of the city may not have decreased too much compared to before March 23. However, the current problem is the supply of grain and oil necessary for the daily life of these tens of thousands of people. The power plant's power supply every night has not only not decreased but has increased because a portion of the defense positions in the suburbs of the city can be illuminated by electricity. In addition to supplying domestic users, the newly installed street lights around the city are lit all night. However, the fuel supply for the power plant has become a problem. Recently, the defending troops negotiated with the China Merchants Bureau for a batch of stored oil to meet the needs.</p>
<p>Although I, as a reporter, encountered many difficulties during the week-long journey to and from Anqing, seeing the heroic fighting of the defending troops in Anqing and the stability of the lives of the people in the city gave me a deep and firm belief.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from Fenghua</h3>
<p>— Our reporter correspondent Li Hongsheng</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Fenghua 21st dispatch] This county, formerly an administrative region, is one of the six counties belonging to Ningbo Prefecture. The residents' language is the Ningbo dialect with slight variations in pronunciation. The language of the residents in the neighboring towns of Ninghai County is similar to the Taiwan dialect. However, the people are honest and upright, and their lives are frugal and simple. Those living near the mountains gather firewood, while those living near the sea engage in fishing and salt production. There are few great merchants who are adept at maneuvering. Wedding and funeral etiquette still follow ancient traditions. Belief in ghosts and gods, and faith in Buddhism and Taoism are still prevalent among the people. The general populace is honest and hardworking, and they are enthusiastic about local public welfare undertakings. Eating three meals a day is common. However, farmers in the southwest of the county eat mostly coarse grains such as sorghum and wheat. They live mainly in tiled houses, usually one household per room. Commoners rise at dawn and rest at dusk. Most do not have bad habits. Gambling is no less prevalent than in other counties, and the authorities are currently strictly cracking down on it.</p>
<p>Weddings and Funerals</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the aftermath of the war, large family forms have gradually decreased, and women in small families must shoulder the burden of household management. Because women's education is not very developed, their service to society is also rare. Social customs are mostly carried out through weddings, birthdays, and funerals. Usually, only seasonal gifts are exchanged. The people mostly believe in Buddhism, followed by Christianity. Superstitious activities such as welcoming gods and holding temple fairs are now extremely rare. However, Buddhist and Taoist water and land rituals, chanting sutras for seven days and nights, and worshiping the Liang Emperor, although not completely extinct, are gradually declining in rural areas. Public entertainment venues include the County-run Zhongzheng Library, the People's Education Hall, Zhongshan Park, Zhongzheng Park, and the public sports field. People's marriages are based on the family's wealth to achieve a match in social status. The wealthy marry earlier, and the poor marry later. Usually, men marry at the age of twenty, and women marry at the age of eighteen. The bad habits of child brides and selling wives have gradually decreased. However, due to the economic downturn and livelihood concerns, there is a gradual trend of late marriage. Wedding ceremonies for families of middle and upper classes are quite extravagant, with dowries being the most important. There are old rituals such as "betrothal" and "exchanging letters" through matchmakers. Towns and cities follow new styles. Nowadays, due to high prices, simplified wedding ceremonies are becoming more common. Funeral ceremonies are also quite elaborate, with procedures such as "issuing announcements," "encoffining," "public mourning," and "funeral procession." The wealthy are also very particular about coffins, and they often choose a site to build a tomb, burying the deceased after many years. The poor have difficulty even affording a thin coffin, and temporary burials are not uncommon.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>This county has been ordered to implement national education since the 29th year. According to the number approved by the Provincial Department of Education, the original eighteen district-run primary schools were changed to township central schools, and one hundred and one primary schools with better performance in each bao were changed to bao national schools. Although it was not perfect at the beginning of the implementation, it has been gradually improved, and the scale has been established. When the county seat fell, most of them were destroyed. Since the 31st year, when the local order was slightly stabilized, the authorities have tried their best to rectify it. First, the schools that were closed were reopened, and the number of students was increased as much as possible. The townships (towns) and baos where schools were not established were established as much as possible. On the one hand, the establishment of educational central institutions in the occupied areas was promoted, and comrades in the education sector were responsible for contacting, eliminating the enslaving education. The school affairs and facilities of each school were strengthened under the guidance of various standards and regulations issued by the Ministry and Province, the treatment of teachers was improved, the funds of the township (town) and Bao National Schools were enriched, and the implementation of civil education work in the National Schools at all levels was supervised. Since the county was liberated after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, after the active reorganization by the authorities, there are now 285 elementary education schools, including Central National Schools and Bao National Schools. There are four secondary education schools: Wuling School, County Middle School, County Simple Normal School, and Private Zhongyi Junior High School. There are public education schools such as the County Zhongzheng Library, the People's Education Hall, and the Public Sports Field.</p>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>This county is an agricultural county, and most people are engaged in agriculture. All crops, in addition to rice, wheat, and vegetables, are bamboo, wood, firewood, and charcoal produced in the three townships of Ganrun, Wanzhu, and Zhenting in the south of the county, and water honey peaches produced in the Jinhua township, which are transported and sold to Shanghai, Ningbo and other places, and enjoy a high reputation. Among the marine products, the number of yellow croakers, sharks, and mantis shrimps in Wutongshan Township, Tongzhao, and Qifeng, which are located near the Xiangshan Port, is also quite considerable. Every year, most fishermen go to sea to fish from the 25th and 6th of the third lunar month to the end of June, and the fishing income is very large, and the people rely on it to maintain their livelihoods. Nowadays, due to soaring prices, income cannot make ends meet, and the economy is quite exhausted.</p>

<h3>Daylight Robbery in the Southern District</h3>
<p>The Guards at Guanqiao Watch Without Saving</p>
<p>Editor: Please disclose this letter. I am a partner in a store in Fengxian Town, Pudong. On April 16, I transported eight small packages of cotton yarn from Shanghai back to Feng on behalf of the store. When I was loading the boat at the Guanqiao Wharf in the Southern District, a group of hooligans (about seven or eight people) cut open the grass bags with foreign knives and robbed the yarn. I and the rickshaw puller were both knocked to the ground. After the event, it was found that four packages were robbed. At that time, the Fourth Guardhouse of the Penglai Branch was set up there, but several policemen turned a blind eye and condoned the hooligans and robbery. Afterwards, I asked them to track them down, but they replied: "Cannot investigate!" Then I went to the Penglai Branch to report, but the gatekeeper refused to accept it! He only said that you should report to the policemen in the guardhouse and ask him to investigate! Sir, you think that under the clear sky, things were robbed, and the police didn't care. Now, I hope that your newspaper will publish it so that others can be careful to prevent the same thing from happening. I am extremely grateful. Shen Xingguo, Qi Xian Town, Zhongyi Township, Erbao, Shiwujia, Liuhu, Fengxian, who was robbed, pays his respects</p>

<h3>New Discussion on Education in Yixing</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhu Xianggao of This Newspaper</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Yixing 20th Dispatch] Every outsider who has left footprints in Yixing generally agrees that the culture and standards in Yixing are more developed compared to other provinces and counties. The driving force behind the improvement of culture and knowledge is the popularization of education. Director Hong of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department once told reporters with pride, "Jiangsu is number one in education nationwide, and Yixing is number one in education in Jiangsu." This was indeed the conclusion he reached based on educational theory and his inspection of educational undertakings in various counties. His approach to education was to start with eliminating illiteracy and popularizing education, and he also planned to create a demonstration area for basic education to promote cultural progress, which was indeed insightful. Recently, County Magistrate Zhou Jingyu, after his first inspection of the rural areas and towns since taking office, told reporters the first thing he said was that Yixing's education is more successful than any other undertaking, which is truly well-deserved. To understand the truth, the reporter inquired with the local education authorities about the general situation of education in the county and deeply felt that the core of education in the county is still trapped in a difficult and arduous abyss. However, it is only through the understanding of the overall situation and the perseverance and efforts of the education personnel that achievements have been made. Therefore, this article is written to serve as a reference for education professionals in various regions.</p>
<p>To be honest, the achievements of education in Yixing are still far behind those of major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. However, compared to general provinces and counties, it is indeed superior. According to the area of 2.6 million mu in Yixing, the total number of students is 55,679. On average, every mu of land has slightly less than 47 students, accounting for slightly more than 8.8% of the total population. If we exclude women, children, the elderly, and professionals, then about 80% of the population are students receiving education. The primary school sector has 48,206 students, with an average age of about six to fifteen years old. The secondary school sector has 7,473 students, with an average age of about thirteen to seventeen years old. There are a total of 540 schools. Each large town has two to three secondary schools, with a total of seventeen in the county. There are 523 primary schools, with a community school in every small village of a dozen or so households. The larger towns can have up to six central elementary schools. Although the equipment is not entirely satisfactory, the quality and quantity are generally well-developed. Even if it is included among the civilized countries of the world, it is still a county with very popular education.</p>
<p>The quality of national education teachers in this county has always been quite high. However, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the management was lacking, resulting in great chaos. Since the restoration, the County Education Bureau has made the rectification of teachers a central task. In 1947, it entrusted the county-run middle school to concurrently run a one-year simplified normal class to train existing teachers, strictly screen whether teachers were qualified, and strengthen training for those who were nearly qualified. All teachers were examined and passed by the Education Bureau and assigned in a unified manner. This work was completed within one year, and more than half of the teachers were eliminated. Immediately felt that there was an abnormal shortage of teachers. In the autumn of last year, the county-run simplified normal school was established independently to specialize in the training of teachers. Currently, in addition to Principal Tang Weizhou, there are nine teachers, divided into one one-year class and two four-year classes, with 161 students. The principals of the school have rich educational experience, and the management is quite effective. Each term of graduates is assigned by the Education Bureau in a unified manner. According to Director Jiang Wenjie's estimation, the teacher force in this county can be adjusted and completed in two years, gradually reaching above the standard level.</p>
<p>There are currently 450 middle school teachers and 1,641 primary school teachers, with women accounting for about 40% of the lower-level middle school teachers. The average salary is from seven shi to eight dou of white rice. Only a small number of technical and specialized teachers in senior high schools have high salaries. Three-fifths of the teachers are still trapped in a state of living in absolute poverty. The only reason is that the county's finances are exhausted, and the education expenses only cover the quota for 500 people, which is far from the actual needs. However, the local people attach great importance to the etiquette and culture left by their ancestors. In every village with slightly more residents, wealthy households donate to promote education. The more they donate, the more free preferential treatment their children receive. Therefore, although nominally managed by the Education Bureau, most of the school properties are supported by local donations. The nominal township schools have disappeared, creating the current thriving scene. Despite the fact that it is not an overly ideal occupation, it is valued by the local people. For example, the first phase of the simplified normal school only enrolled 90 students, but more than 1,200 people applied for the exam. They know that they will struggle on the edge of life, but they understand the overall situation, recognize the times, and in any difficult situation, they still grit their teeth and never neglect or be discouraged by their duties due to the fact that their qualities do not meet their ideals. They are never willing to petition or strike. In addition, the academic atmosphere is pure and simple. Even children from poor farming families know how to concentrate on their studies and respect their teachers. Although "student movements" in outside cities are making a lot of noise, they have not infected this county at all. After the restoration, social education was turbulent, but the academic circles in this county have been in a state of peaceful singing. This is a rare phenomenon in other counties.</p>
<p>Here we will talk about the promotion of basic education demonstration areas repeatedly announced by the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department. According to precise statistics, the illiteracy rate in this county still accounts for slightly less than 52% of the total population. Therefore, the establishment of this program is even more necessary to actively promote. After the County Education Bureau drafted the work outline and implementation measures and submitted them for approval, they were implemented on the first of this month. However, because it requires huge expenses and a lot of manpower, it can only be carried out in the two towns of Yixing and Heqiao to pilot the demonstration area. After completion within a certain period, efforts will be gradually made to expand, and then a second suitable area will be selected for the original personnel to continue to implement.</p>
<p>The success of local undertakings, education first. The students of today are the administrators of the country and society in the future. Can we still underestimate education!</p>

<h3>Emergency Transportation and Sales Plan for Guizhou Salt</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liu Mengchi of This Newspaper</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Guiyang April 16th Airmail] Salt in Guizhou, in terms of people's daily necessities, nothing is more precious than it. Chairman Gu Zheng Lun, since November last year, has been worrying about it day and night, and doing everything possible to seek a thorough solution. Niu Jianxia, ​​Director of the Sichuan-Kang Salt Affairs Administration, was recently specially invited from Zigong to Guizhou. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the first session of the seventh meeting of the Provincial Council, the provincial government, the Salt Bureau, and public opinion organs jointly discussed it, in order to be able to obtain a practical and effective solution.</p>
<p>When Director Niu first arrived in Guiyang, he attempted to use the ten articles of his "Plan for Improving the Transportation and Sales of Salt in Guizhou Province" as a blueprint for discussion. In that plan, he pushed the responsibilities of the salt affairs organs at all levels cleanly, and also left many loopholes that could allow distributors and Salt Bureau personnel to collude and engage in corruption and personal gain. At the first salt affairs symposium held by the Provincial Council, Director Niu became the target of venting anger for the 11 million people of Guizhou who could not eat salt. The situation that day was truly embarrassing for him.</p>
<p>Subsequently, four or five symposiums were held in a row, and finally, after synthesizing opinions from all parties, the Salt Affairs Committee of the Provincial Council drafted another "Summary of Temporary Emergency Transportation and Sales Plan for Guizhou Salt" in thirteen articles, and was unanimously approved by all councilors at the conference, and sent to the provincial government for implementation. In the future, if the Salt Bureau can earnestly promote it, and the provincial government and public opinion organs can effectively supervise, then the 11 million people of Guizhou will not have to worry about expensive or bland salt.</p>
<p>The content of the plan is strictly stipulated: (1) The amount of salt required for Guizhou Province is 143,000 market dans. This is determined based on the province's population of one market catty of salt per person per month plus the amount of Changping salt. It is estimated that Sichuan salt is 110,000 market dans, Guangdong salt is 30,000 market dans, and Yunnan salt is 3,000 market dans, breaking the old sales system that does not conform to the actual situation, so that people in the southeast, northwest, and north of Guizhou Province can obtain the convenience of salt transportation and sales nearby. (2) The section from the Sichuan salt field to the riverbank is fully responsible for the transportation and relief by the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau. Guangdong and Yunnan salt will still be handled according to the usual practice, allowing individual merchants to freely purchase and transport back to Guizhou for sales, avoiding the disadvantages of the counties in southwestern and southeastern Guizhou having to eat expensive Sichuan salt. (3) Any merchant can apply to purchase and transport Sichuan salt to Guizhou for sales when it reaches the riverbank. The tax rate will still be calculated at 10% from the levy, so as to eliminate the problem of collusion and monopoly of the Salt Bureau by a small number of distributors in the past to create a black market. (4) In order to make the bank price reasonable and let the people of Guizhou understand the actual situation, the Guizhou Provincial Government and the Guizhou Provincial Council should jointly send personnel to the bank to verify the price. (5) In order to avoid the lack of salt sales in each bank due to difficult transportation routes and to encourage merchants to purchase and transport salt, the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau will try its best to negotiate with the national bank to provide low-interest loans to support them, because the rivers in the Wujiang River basin in northeastern Guizhou are high and the water is rapid, and transportation is difficult. I am afraid that transporters will not be happy to take risks, and people in that area may eat expensive and bland salt, so transportation and sales are especially encouraged. (6) Old transporters in 1948 who have already arrived at the bank with salt. And the salt from the field to the bank is still the responsibility of the salt merchants to transport it to the various strongholds, pay taxes and sell it freely, so as to avoid disconnection. If the transporter is unable to transport it inland, it shall be sold to scattered merchants in Guizhou Province at the bank or en route by the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau at the checked price. Transporters should hand over the difference between the bank sale price and the checked price to the public. If salt needs to be sold en route to support transportation, it must be reported and approved for self-sale en route. (7) After the implementation of this method, the salt that the transporters have already transported to the inner bank strongholds will be allowed to be sold freely by each merchant after paying the tax. (8) After the implementation of this method, the original method of purchasing salt with certificates and limited sales will be abolished at the same time. (9) From now on, the Guizhou Provincial Salt Affairs Agency should focus on transporting salt at the bank and strengthening the storage of Changping salt. (10) Salt merchants in each county of Guizhou Province should purchase salt in the county to avoid salt shortages. (11) The Changping salt at each stronghold, except for the salt for civil servants, teachers, schools, groups, and troops in the location of the salt affairs agency, will be issued and sold according to one catty of salt per person per month, and staff rosters will be opened. It will not be issued or sold at ordinary times. If there is a shortage of salt, it will be issued, but it will still be limited to commissioned retail sales, and its price will be determined based on weight cost. (12) This plan should be abolished no later than the end of June 1949, but if the handling is indeed effective, it may be extended after negotiation and agreement between the salt affairs agency and the Guizhou Provincial Government. (13) The salt quota that should be allocated from January to March 1949 should be transported to the designated location in a short period of time as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Food and Social Affairs Bureau's Price Limit Is Not Enough To Cover The Cost. The Rice Market Is At A Standstill. Off-Site Prices Are Rising Madly. White Rice Is Selling For Three Million.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Food and Social Affairs Bureau limited the price to no more than two million, but because the prices of various items outside the circle have risen far more than the price of rice, and the production price remains firm, the price limit is not enough to cover the cost, so trading cannot be opened.</p>
<p>Off-site prices rose sharply by 40% in the early market. Late rice spot reached as high as three million at one point. Later, the market finally fell back to 2.7 million at the close due to tight monetary conditions.

<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the price limit imposed by the Food and Social Affairs Bureau that the price should not exceed yesterday's closing price, the market transaction was also at a standstill.

Soybean cake also rose, with Changzi cake trading at 800,000.</p>

<p>Grains</p>
<p>The market is still firm. Unborn peanuts are not popular and have fallen by 10%. Soybeans continue to rise due to oil cakes. Stocks are becoming increasingly scarce.

<h3>The Banking Sector Is Experiencing Unprecedentedly Tight Monetary Conditions. Off-Site Gold Prices Are Plunging.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] Yesterday, the gold market experienced a sharp decline. Because the Central Bank suddenly released 1,700 large bars on the previous day, the monetary conditions in the industry were unprecedentedly tight, giving the general speculators a head-on blow. The secret interest rate was as high as 500 yuan, and the highest was even 600 yuan. At 11:15, the gold shops still had more than 200 billion yuan to pay for the Central Bank's gold sale and could not settle it. After the agent repeatedly requested the Central Bank to dredge it, it was changed to applying for a letter to resolve it in the afternoon. Off-site spot trading opened at 26 million, 27 million, and fell sharply to 22 million, 23 million in a sale. The Central Bank continued to entrust Dadecheng and Zhaofengchang to sell in large quantities at 22 million. Because no one accepted it, only 26 large bars were sold. At noon, because the position was still tight, all parties' turnover suddenly failed, and they cut their losses painfully. The low price was once seen at 20 million, 21 million, and finally closed at 21 million, 22 million.</p>
<p>Afternoon next-day trading was not conducted due to the high risk. Until about 6 pm, the missing orders of some small firms were common, and the position could not be made up. The last cash delivery of the day was only 19 million, and some were also sold, already shedding 200,000, a sharp drop of more than 8 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Yesterday's off-site futures trading was slightly declining because there were large players behind the scenes supporting the market. The morning opened at 30 million, 31 million. Although the situation was tense and benefited the gold market in the middle, the position was extremely tight, and many floating positions were sold. The noon closed down all the way to 27.5 million, 28 million.</p>
<p>Afternoon intraday trading opened at 27.8 million, 28.3 million, and fell to 25.2 million, 25.7 million at the close, with no difference from the previous day's results.

The road trading was initially flat and then fell. In the morning, the big head still called 450,000, 480,000.

The market interest rate of various industries also opened at an average of between 300 and 400 yuan. The interest rate outside the stock exchange was only 115 yuan and 125 yuan because there was a sale everywhere. The interest rate on the National Bank's telegraphic transfer has been increased to 63 yuan, 33 cents from yesterday, and the daily interest rate has been increased to 51 yuan, 20 cents.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Increase Slightly</h3>
<p>The foreign stock market is not as prosperous as the Chinese stock market, and the monetary conditions are extremely tight, and the increase has been slightly seen. Yesterday, the opening price of each stock, Yisha entered at 470,000 and exited at 490,000 yuan. A decrease of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Lingering Decline, Cloth Market Unfurls Price Drops</h3>
<p>With cotton yarn prices falling, and given the turbulent times, all parties are wary. Yesterday's market started weak and ended fatigued, with fluctuations reaching 20% midway.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened high at 14,500,000, but new buyers remained hesitant, and sales were sluggish. The price gradually declined to close at 12,000,000, a sharp drop of 5,000,000.</p>
<p>32-count Silver Moon quickly retreated from 11,000,000 to settle at 9,000,000, ultimately falling by 3,000,000.</p>
<p>12-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 8,800,000 and then plummeted to 7,100,000, before slightly recovering to 7,200,000 at the close, a decrease of 4,000,000 from the previous day. 20-count yarns uniformly fell below the 7,000,000 mark, while 16-count yarns showed some strength, with Brightness and Tiannv each rising by 1,500,000 to 2,000,000. Other yarns all weakened.</p>
<p>Due to the tense situation and the severe credit crunch, the cloth market was filled with anxiety. Buyers showed no interest, and many businesses settled their accounts, leading to widespread price declines in various cloths.</p>
<p>Dragon Head Fine Cloth initially opened at 2,740,000, briefly rising slightly to 2,700,000, but around noon, news of a gold crash to 2,000,000 circulated, coupled with high commissions of forty yuan. The market then plunged, closing at 2,350,000, a sharp drop of 620,000 from the previous evening's close. However, selling continued after the close, with the market still showing weakness.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Serge initially opened at 260,000. After reaching a high of 2,750,000, it ultimately retreated to 2,320,000, a sharp drop of 640,000, due to overwhelming pressure. After the close, it fell further to 2,280,000. Due to cost considerations, initial bids for both Dragon Head Fine Cloth and Four Gentlemen Serge were opened high around the 3,000,000 mark, but they eventually softened, with the evening close falling to around 2,780,000.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Did Not Open Yesterday, Artificial Silk and Silk Goods Still Rise in Quality</h3>
<p>The asking price for superior grade raw silk yesterday morning was 13,000,000, but due to the rampant war atmosphere and nervous sentiment, retail investors remained cautious. Despite some interest, bids were only at 11,500,000, resulting in no transactions. There were still no trades by noon.</p>
<p>Artificial silk yesterday morning opened at 6,400,000 for Tianqiao immediate delivery, but no trades occurred. It then opened at 6,000,000, but due to widespread anxiety and a desire to liquidate holdings for cash, the market trended downward. The noon close was at 5,750,000. Today's forward transactions opened at 7,800,000, reaching a high of 8,100,000, but a severe credit crunch both inside and outside the circle pushed the price back down slightly to 7,900,000, an increase of 800,000 from the previous market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Huaqiang silk fabrics initially rose to the limit at the open, closing at 33,696,000. After the close, off-market trading was quoted at 4,800,000, then traded at 4,500,000, and finally fell to 4,350,000, an increase of 250,000 from the previous noon.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Lacks Momentum, Soap, Candles, and Matches Trend Upward</h3>
<p>The cigarette market trend yesterday lacked momentum. Commissions were high, with at least 300 yuan per thousand, making it difficult to bear. Actual sales were sluggish, with supply exceeding demand, leading to a downward trend.</p>
<p>Soap, candles, and matches are daily necessities, so demand was strong, leading to a sharp increase of over 40% yesterday. Prices were: White Tin Package 280,000 yuan, Three Cannons 225,000 yuan, Ten-Piece British 285,000 yuan, Twenty-Piece British 115,000 yuan, Ten-Piece Old Knife 260,000 yuan, Big Beautiful 165,000 yuan, Golden Mouse 80,000 yuan, Bank 127,000 yuan, Double Axe 58,000 yuan, Brandy 113,000 yuan, Big Claes 108,000 yuan, Standard 52,000 yuan, Canned Cagliostro 460,000 yuan, Three Five Brand Three Door Lock, Craven 280,000 yuan, Golden Frame 240,000 yuan, Sailor 250,000 yuan, Solid Soap 3,400,000 yuan, Scissors Soap 3,100,000 yuan, Huang Xiangmao 2,400,000 yuan, Beautiful Matches 15,000,000 yuan, Phoenix Matches 14,000,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Trend Still Stable</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a certain tea magnate interviewed by our reporter: With the currency devaluing so rapidly, tea farmers in the producing areas, to avoid losses, have long been exchanging tea for gold, silver dollars, and valuables. Recently, businesses in this city have been following suit, leading to a new high in tea prices when converted to gold yuan, creating an unstoppable trend.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market, amid the fluctuating decline of various financial assets, saw the tea market initially remain stable, but it eventually succumbed to pressure and followed the downward trend. However, buyer demand remained high, and the unprecedented credit crunch prevented progress, leaving transactions without momentum.</p>
<p>It was also mentioned that since the victory, tea, a major export of China, has been on the brink of crisis due to exchange rate issues and the impact of discounted sales of tea from Ceylon, Java, and Japan. The current turbulent situation and various other factors are pushing tea into a whirlpool, making the future very uncertain.</p>
<h3>Credit Tight, High Black Market Interest, Chinese Stocks Initially Weak, Then Flat</h3>
<p>As peace talks have broken down and the Communist Party has ordered a full-scale attack, the recent bullish trend in Chinese stocks came to an end yesterday. With a large amount of funds flowing in and out of the Central Bank today, credit was extremely tight and black market interest rates were unusually high, around 300-400 yuan per thousand per day. Businesses were wary, with little buying interest. Speculators sold short, causing prices to fall. Consequently, except for Taiwan Sugar, which remained at the limit, other active stocks fell compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Record yarn opened high at 185 yuan, and short sellers rushed to sell at high prices, causing the market to decline. New sellers, not wanting to be left behind, also sold, resulting in a market dominated by selling pressure after the open. Fortunately, "big player" No. 13 intervened to support the market, stabilizing it somewhat, but it still appeared fragile and soon declined again. Retail investors remained cautious, not daring to act rashly, causing prices to fall further. The market reached a low of 160 yuan, before slightly recovering to close at 165 yuan. The American-Asian market was unusually volatile, with a trend of initially strong then weak. It opened at 4.5 yuan, reached a low of 3.55 yuan, and closed at only 3.8 yuan. Apart from a limited number of stocks such as Commercial Press, most stocks showed weakness.</p>
<p>The market outlook is for unprecedentedly tight credit and soaring black market interest rates. Yesterday afternoon's transactions saw two-day high interest rates, leading to many limit-up moves. Yong Yarn set a new price of 209 yuan. Tongyi, Jinglun, American-Asian, New Asia, Xinyi, Matches, Earth &amp; Mud, National Goods, Commercial, and Taiwan Sugar all reached their limit. However, in the application trading section, shorts were pressured by the credit crunch and the burden of high interest, and they continued to sell. For a time, there were many sellers, with Yong Yarn leading the decline, falling to 139 yuan. Near the close, news of a slight decrease in black market interest rates led to some stabilization. As a result, the application trading prices for Yong Yarn, American-Asian, and Jingfu fluctuated, entirely due to the varying two-day interest rates. Stocks continued to rise by 4 jiao to 35 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total transaction volume of 2.61165 billion shares.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll</h3>
<p>— A Spectator</p>
<p>The Market Enters Wartime State, The Rush Turns to Differential Increases</p>
<p>The military authorities announced yesterday that the city has entered a wartime state and declared eight emergency regulations, subject to military control. Speculation, hoarding, and those who disrupt financial stability and prices will be severely punished by military law.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market improved overall and returned to a stable state, which is a major achievement. The only regret is that the rice market continued to rise wildly, with large transactions reaching 3 million and retail prices even higher than imagined.</p>
<p>Rice is a necessity for people's livelihood. Although the government controls two-thirds of the city's rice supply, the military is above all else during wartime, and military stability is more important than people's food. Therefore, public concern about food can only be addressed by actively collecting reserves from the producing areas. Otherwise, the price of rice rising alone will disrupt the price balance, rendering all efforts to control prices ineffective.</p>
<p>After prices went from rising to falling, the development of the military situation will have a significantly different impact on general goods. As we have repeatedly mentioned in the past, for example, heavy items will be sold off, while light and convenient items will become more popular.</p>
<p>Yesterday, commodity prices were generally weak, except for rice, which rose alone. Is this the beginning of a new trend? It is difficult to judge. However, it can be asserted that the indiscriminate trend of the past will sooner or later be replaced by a differential trend.</p>
<p>The factor of time has a decisive effect on whether a new trend arrives. People in the market are temporarily unable to distinguish and predict in the midst of panic.</p>
<p>We are most concerned about the future of manufacturers in this situation.</p>
<p>Maintaining combat operations and industrial production can be discussed later. What should be of concern now is the weakening of prices, even the potential for a collapse in the prices of some goods, which could threaten the survival of manufacturers.</p>
<p>According to rumors yesterday, some manufacturers in the city have already closed down. This has led to debt disputes and unemployment disputes, which are very serious problems.</p>
<p>The wage problem must be resolved reasonably and recognized by the military and political authorities. The general tendency is to demand the issuance of silver dollars, or, as a second choice, to require wages to be paid in silver dollars.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been strong calls for the issuance of silver dollar certificates. If wages are paid in silver dollars, meaning that they are paid in silver dollar certificates, that would be very inappropriate. Because this would not protect the livelihoods of workers, but would be seen as making fun of them, especially at this time and place, which is absolutely not to be tried.</p>
<p>As for paying wages in silver dollars, the key is 1) the accuracy of the index and 2) the stability of prices after wages are paid, both of which are difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The Central Bank sold more than 1,000 taels of gold the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning, silver was very tight. It is said that the Central Bank added fuel to the fire, so the tight situation continued into the afternoon.</p>
<p>The result of credit expansion is considered by most to be the main reason for the tight credit. In fact, the problem lies not only in credit expansion, but also in the unexpected and sudden changes in prices. Yesterday, when prices were flat and weak, capital turnover became difficult and credit tightened.</p>
<p>Currently, everything hinges on how the overall situation develops.</p>
<p>In the next few days, there may be military conscription and other actions, which will have a profound impact on the market.</p>
<p>Wildly rising prices in the market are certainly harmful, but if the market stops rising while retail prices continue to rise, stopping the rise will only make industry and commerce more miserable and worsen people's livelihoods.</p>

There will definitely be a fierce battle with skillful play.

<h3>Unveiling the Baseball Season, Pandas Play American Sailors Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Panda team, the softball champion that has dominated Shanghai for many years, will play an exhibition game against the players from the US Navy's DeHaven destroyer at the Racecourse at 3:00 PM this afternoon, officially kicking off the city's softball season.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Liang Fuchu, the "Panda Ambassador," the Panda team has already started practicing to maintain its past reputation in this year's softball season. In terms of the lineup, except for the newly recruited catcher Cao Kejia, who has gone to Taiwan and is replaced by veteran Wang Qingrui, there are no changes to the lineup. The pitcher is still the famous Li Qiteng, known for his infinitely varied pitches. The three Liang brothers will play third base, shortstop, and left field.</p>
<p>The DeHaven team has defeated other American military teams in weekend practice games four or five times. Their batting is strong and far-reaching, unmatched by other teams in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Weighing the strength of the two teams, the Pandas are strong on defense, while the Americans are strong on offense. However, the Chinese players have been working together for years, and under Liang Fuchu's planning, they can also use clever bunts and short hits to attack the opponent's weaknesses. The chances of victory are higher.</p>
<p>In short, today's game will be exciting and will be a great spectacle for the fans who can enter the Racecourse. The Panda lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Pitcher: Li Qiteng, Catcher: Wang Qingrui</p>
<p>First Base: Mei Yingjun, Second Base: Wen Tianhua</p>
<p>Third Base: Liang Youwen, Shortstop: Liang Yousheng</p>
<p>Left Field: Liang Youyi, Center Field: Zhong Baoluo</p>
<p>Right Field: Lu Zhaosen, Cai Dingzhong, Ba Shun, Zheng Deyao</p>
<h3>Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou Table Tennis Tournament, Decided to Fight in July</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Aviation News] Before setting off to Singapore, the Macau table tennis team of twelve were invited by Mr. Wu Qutiam, Chairman of the Hong Kong General Association, to attend a farewell party on the fifth floor of the Renren Restaurant, and to discuss the triangular inter-city table tennis tournament between Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Macau.</p>
<p>The Macau team is scheduled to play seven matches in Singapore. The order has been arranged by the Singapore General Association: the first match against the Singapore runner-up Jingwu team, the second against the Singapore champion team, and the third against the Northern Malaysia team. In addition, the Singapore United Team, the Malaya National Team, and the Malaya Armed Forces Team will also compete against them, and finally there will be a match in Ipoh.</p>
<p>Regarding the triangular inter-city tournament, in addition to Zhong Rongguang, Wu Qutiam, Zhou Zhenbang, Lai Duanfu, Chen Gongshan, Luo Wenhua, and Liang Tang, who are the backbone of Hong Kong and Macau, Guangzhou also sent representative Xie Yingzhong to attend the discussions.</p>
<p>The following procedures for organizing the inter-city tournament were decided on the spot: (1) Organize a Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Macau Inter-City Table Tennis Tournament Committee to handle all matters related to the inter-city tournament. (2) Each city will send three representatives to serve as committee members. At each meeting, the host city will send one person to serve as the chairman. (3) The inter-city tournament will be held in each city once a year on a rotational basis (i.e., a total of three times). The order of the host cities will be determined by drawing lots. (4) For the men's inter-city tournament, each team will have seven regular players and three substitutes. For the women's tournament, each team will have three regular players and two substitutes. (5) There will be a total of seven matches in the men's tournament, with each match adopting a best-of-three-games format. The winner of each game will score one point, and the first team to reach four points will be considered the winner. There will be three matches in the women's tournament, with the first team to score two points considered the winner. The rules of the game will be in accordance with the world table tennis regulations, with each game scored to 21 points. (6) The game ball will be a hard ball in principle. (7) Each visiting team will bear its own travel and accommodation expenses. All ticket revenue will belong to the host team and will be used for the construction of a gymnasium fund and may not be used for other purposes. (8) Players from each city must have resided in the city for more than three months to be eligible for selection. (9) The prize for the first inter-city tournament will be a sterling silver cup donated by Macau businessman He Xian, which will be awarded to the team with the most wins. If the number of wins is the same, the winner will be determined by the total score; if the scores are still the same, the winner will be determined by the total number of games won. (10) This year's inter-city tournament will run from July to the end of June next year.</p>
<p>After the rules for the inter-city tournament were determined, lots were drawn to determine that the first tournament will be held in Macau, the second in Hong Kong, and the third in Guangzhou. The date of the first tournament will be decided after the Macau team returns from Singapore. With the opening of the inter-city tournament not far away, Hong Kong has decided to have the Competition Department, Zhou Zhenbang and Zhong Zuoyong, be responsible for quickly organizing an all-Hong Kong open men's and women's singles competition to prepare for the selection of inter-city players.</p>
<h3>Indian Football Team's Visit to Hong Kong a Pipe Dream, Java Plans to Invite South China to Play</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Aviation News] It was previously reported that the South China Athletic Association had written to India to invite an Indian football team to Hong Kong for a match. According to reliable sources, South China has received a reply from India stating that due to various reasons, they cannot send a team to the Far East for a match, nor did they express any interest in inviting South China to India for a match.</p>
<p>According to another source, Java is planning to invite South China to play there, but whether this will happen remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>99 Athletics Team to Practice Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The city's 99 Athletics Team is scheduled to hold its third general practice session at Chung Cheng Park tomorrow (24th) at 8:00 AM. All team members are expected to attend on time.</p>

It is expected that the championships and consolation championships for both groups can be resolved in early May. In addition, the consolation match between Jianle and Police Machinery, originally scheduled for 6:30 PM on the 24th, has been forfeited by Police Machinery, so Jianle advances without effort.</p>

<p>The first match is a girls' junior match between Minli and Ya Team. The latter made their debut in a friendly match the other day, defeating the Power Team 32-24, winning their first victory. Players such as Zhu Min, Sun Fengzhu, Zhu Jiazhen, Jiang Zhelun, and Qian Mengyue are all skilled players and performed outstandingly. Minli is a leading school team and also has considerable strength, but facing the Ya Team, which has gathered famous players, they are likely to have a difficult time.</p>
<p>The second match is a men's consolation match between Friends and Pei Er. Friends has the four knights of Wang Zhengjun, Xia Zhiongzhang, Chen Xiaofa, and Zhang Mingren, who are very powerful. Pei Er has many university athletes who are all young and strong. There will be a fierce battle when they meet.</p>
<p>The final match is a men's semi-final between Ren Yu and McLins, competing for the division leadership. The winner will advance to the top four single round-robin tournament, which is related to the future of the championship, so both sides will put in their best efforts. Ren Yu is the runner-up in this year's league, with Shen Pengju, Sun Guozheng, Yao Wenyu, Wu Xinyun, Wang Huaiting, and Li Zhaohe all having fought on the field for a long time, and Xu Zhongyi's recent form is getting better and better. Zhuang Yirong is making a comeback, and the team's momentum is growing stronger. McLins' foreign soldiers are all strong and sturdy. In a friendly match against Dagong the other day, they not only performed well, but also posed a great threat to Dagong. Tonight's match with Ren Yu can be called evenly matched. The lineups for tonight's six teams are listed below:</p>

<h3>Chinese and Western Six Groups, Track and Field Meet</h3>

<p>The Chinese YMCA, Western YMCA, Haiqing, McTyeire School, Russian Emigrant Sports Association, and St. John's six groups are hosting a Chinese and Western track and field meet, scheduled for May 14 at McTyeire School.

<h3>Tonight's Class A Table Tennis Match: Reigning Champion Jingwu vs. Qinglian; Last Night Huamei Swept Choubai with a Score of 5-0</h3>
<p>In the fourth annual table tennis league, tonight (the 23rd), starting at 7:00 PM, there will be one Class A match and three Class B matches. The Class A match will be moved to the Jingfen Table Tennis Room on the third floor of Cishu Building, featuring Jingwu against Qinglian. Jingwu is the reigning champion with formidable strength and unparalleled resilience. All-China Games table tennis champion Wang Youxin is still under their banner, along with veteran all-rounder Ouyang Wei, and Zhang Fuwei, who has twice defeated first-rate players like Chuan Qifang. Their skills are superior and captivating, giving them the greatest confidence in winning this year's championship. Qinglian is a level below and hardly their equal. In tonight's encounter, there is concern they will be completely defeated. Their only hope lies with team captain Liu Baotai, who, if able to avoid head-on clashes in the roster and maintain an indomitable fighting spirit, might break the duck egg record through a lucky opportunity.</p>
<p>The three Class B matches are of less importance. Xingguang, Xinyi, and Chouhong are slightly stronger and should advance smoothly. The order of matches and the rosters of the two Class A teams are listed below:</p>
<p>Jingwu vs. Qinglian (Class A) 7:00 PM Jingfen</p>
<p>Xingguang vs. Mingxing (Class B Group 3) 8:30 PM Jingzong</p>
<p>Xinyi vs. Hujing (Class B Group 2) 7:00 PM Xinyi</p>
<p>Chouhong vs. Jinmen (Class B Group 3) 7:00 PM Chouye</p>
<p>(Jingwu) Zhang Fuwei (Captain), Ouyang Wei, Yang Kaiyun, Wang Youxin, Li Longbiao, Chen Zengliang, Gao Hongxing, Shui Hangao.</p>
<p>(Qinglian) Liu Baotai (Captain), Wang Zongze, Cao Taichang, Li Peiran, Liang Manhui, Du Boru, Shen Lunzhang, Tu Youci.</p>
<p>The Class A match between Huamei and Choubai the night before was held at the auditorium of the Chouye Guild Hall, drawing over 400 spectators. The atmosphere was lively. Chen Linsheng, the general director of the league, also attended to assist as a referee. Choubai, knowing they could not defeat the brave Huamei, still faced the match with high spirits and a mindset of observation. Female player Sun Meiying even took the lead, receiving applause and cheers from the crowd. However, ultimately, she was unable to withstand the pressure and was defeated by Huamei's Li Zongpei. In the remaining four matches, Choubai suffered consecutive defeats. Veteran Kong Hanchen, however, with his stable smashes, posed a significant threat to Huamei's chopper Wang Jiuqing. Jiuqing eventually prevailed after a long chopping battle, winning 2-1. Huamei's main player Xue Xuchu did not exert his full strength. Young player Xue Weichu, making his debut in a major match, showed great effort and promising potential. In particular, Lu Hanjun, seasoned from countless battles, remained sharp and in top form. His opponent, newcomer Zhao Zhenyuan, lacked the skill to resist and had to retreat. As a result, Huamei decisively defeated Choubai with a score of 5-0. In the six Class B matches, the intense battle between the United team of Group 2 and the Public Transport team saw veteran Zhu Jianzhang unexpectedly defeated 2-1 by Public Transport's main player Sheng Risheng. However, United ultimately defeated Public Transport 3-2, which can be considered a blessing in disguise. In Group 3, the Jingwei youngsters suffered a painful defeat against Nongji. Team captain Mang Peijun underperformed, failing to secure a win that was within reach, which ultimately affected the overall situation. As a result, Nongji defeated Jingwei 4-1. The results of the Class A matches and the results of the Class B matches are listed below:</p>
<p>(Huamei) Score (Choubai)</p>
<p>Li Zongpei 21-17 21-18 Sun Meiying</p>

<h3>Two Eccentric Guides of the American University Basketball Champion Team</h3>
<p>— Qi Gong Shang</p>
<p>The Kentucky University team and the St. Lowis University basketball team are excellent teams in the United States. The former is coached by the famous Adolph Rupp, and the latter is guided by the famous Ed Hickey. The Kentucky team was the champion of the 1945 National Invitation Tournament. This team does not have giants, but it shows a rapid, powerful, and accurate shooting force. St. Louis defeated Kentucky 42-40 in the 1949 season to win the Sugak Bowl championship. This team is made up of five giants and relies on giant players. Both teams are skilled, and the individual skills between the players are excellent, and the instructors are well-coached and guided to achieve great success. The following are the theories of these two famous guides, specially compiled for basketball instructors and newcomers to use as reference materials.</p>
<p>Adolph Rupp</p>
<p>He is a professor at Kentucky University. Except for 1946-1947, he has served at the university for 16 years. The basketball team he has guided has played a total of 283 games, and only lost 64 games. Until now, he is still reviewing the key to these 64 failures. In a period of more than five years, the team has won 45 consecutive important games.</p>
<p>Kentucky's athletes are allowed to receive accommodation, tuition exemption, books, laundry, and a monthly allowance of 10 yuan per athlete under the League Association regulations, so Mr. A has the right to allocate 15 free places for athletes to his basketball players every year.</p>
<p>Mr. A can be regarded as the professor with the highest salary for basketball guidance in the United States, with an annual salary of 8,500 yuan.</p>
<p>In 1930, he created a new tactic. At that time, teams in Kentucky and other southern schools focused on the "slow attack method", which was called the "Illinois system". Mr. A created a new style and announced that he wanted to create a "fast attack method" tactic.</p>
<p>When Mr. A decided to guide the new tactics, the editor of the school's "Weekly" sports column wrote that Mr. A's attempt may not be successful, holding a doubtful attitude, because the team was already proficient in the "slow attack method". Once the team changed its course, it was feared that it would be difficult to control the team. In the Southern Championship finals, the team was defeated by the Maryland team with a score of 29-27 in the last 40 seconds.</p>
<p>After hearing the news of the defeat, the editor of the sports column wrote a commentary with tears in his eyes, believing that the athletes had done their best to contribute to the alma mater. Although they were defeated, they were still glorious. This was because the team had not achieved 100% success after adopting the new tactics. Even if they unfortunately lost the opportunity to win the championship, they had made significant progress and amazing performances in tactics.</p>
<p>Adolph Rupp is 46 years old. In 1937, he suffered from spinal paralysis. For a period of time, the use of his left hand was not flexible. He had to use his right hand to reach into the left pocket of his pants to get things. After a famous doctor, Herbert Lingdong, performed surgery, he gradually recovered, but he still had to wear a copper and leather girdle and sit on a chair to guide the team. Now he has fully recovered.</p>
<p>Mr. A is proficient in guiding the team to use the screen attack technique. The team uses a pure and skilled formation. The players' movements are tacitly cooperative. Their skills are beyond the reach of other teams.</p>
<p>In terms of defense, Mr. A has long abandoned the zone defense system and advocated the use of man-to-man defense. According to his theory, when the opponent uses a formation to attack, and the defender adopts a passive zone defense system, he is always in a passive position and is often preempted. The attacker controls the ball and makes quick and accurate passes left and right, forcing the defender to move, being restrained and separated. All are passive. When there is a gap in the defender's area, the attacker will rush in from that gap to make a contribution. This passive defense method is difficult to win.</p>
<p>Mr. A teaches a course on "Advanced Basketball Skills", which is most suitable for people who will be serving as instructors in the future to choose.</p>

<h3>My Forgetfulness</h3>
<p>— Ai Yang</p>
<p>I often like to clip banknotes, especially new large banknotes, in books as bookmarks. But when I need to use them, I often have to search through the books on the shelf, one by one, before I can find the "treasury" from not long ago. The doctor said that I must stop smoking, stop writing, take tonics, and get more sleep. Otherwise, "the consequences of this forgetfulness are unimaginable," and so on. At the time, I was terrified when I heard this, and quickly extinguished the remaining half of the cigarette in my hand. But soon after, when I repeatedly "tried hard" to recall the doctor's advice on how to take care of myself, I couldn't remember anything at all. I had another case of forgetfulness!</p>
<p>Under the lamp, friends were discussing prices and lamenting that the big head had risen to 400,000. Suddenly, A asked how much the big head sold for on this day last month? Four or five people tried their best to recall, but no one could "recall" it. A then asked what the rice price was three days ago? Some said 2 million, some said 2.5 million. Checking the newspaper, no one answered correctly. The conversation then moved from Gold Yuan to Legal Tender. I asked: What was the highest denomination of Legal Tender? Everyone opened their eyes and mouths, not knowing the answer. Everyone said strangely: Why is our memory so bad?</p>
<p>At this point, I was very happy in my heart—a little bit of gloating. It turns out that I am not the only one suffering from forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Who makes everyone forgetful?</p>
<p>C said: It's all the fault of that printing press.</p>
<p>However, the printing press seems to be suffering from forgetfulness as well. Less than a year ago, the Legal Tender went from thousands to ten thousands, to hundreds of thousands, millions, ten millions… and finally collapsed. And today, the Gold Yuan is also going from thousands to ten thousands, to fifty thousands, to one hundred thousands…, and the speed is as fast as if it is "familiar with the road." The printing press is only focused on shipping quickly and has forgotten the past events of the collapse of the Legal Tender.</p>
<p>I thought: Anyway, everyone is suffering from forgetfulness, just like everyone is keeping Western-style hair, what's so strange about it? At least, I am forgetful, so I don't remember yesterday's prices, and I even forget the current prices. In a daze, I don't have to shudder at "it's gone up several times again!" Isn't this a great blessing?</p>
<h3>The Wisdom of Dogs</h3>
<p>— Sang</p>
<p>Someone accidentally brought up the cleverness of dogs, and one person told a story: A family once had a very clever hunting dog. One night, there was a sudden fire in the house. The fire was very fierce, and everyone was unable to save anything, even the child in the bedroom. At this time, the hunting dog rushed into the house and soon brought the child out. The owner was so happy that he shed tears. But suddenly, the dog rushed into the flames again. Everyone was surprised and worried about it, but it rushed out again. The flames had burned its fur, but it was holding the fire insurance policy in its mouth!</p>
<h3>Huaiyin's Noodles</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Huaiyin County in Jiangbei was called Qingjiangpu before the Republic of China. Before the Tianjin-Pukou and Pinghan Railways were built and maritime transport was unblocked, the area was a transportation hub for north-south traffic. Travelers going north and south all changed boats and cars here. There were also two administrative agencies, the River Police and the Grain Transport Police. The extravagance of the river workers' diet was famous throughout the world. Since the Yellow River moved north and the grain transport was changed to maritime transport, and railways and steamships gradually rose, Qingjiangpu gradually declined in the late Qing Dynasty. However, Huai cuisine and Huai snacks still enjoy a high reputation to this day. In the early Republic of China, when I was drinking in Feiyuan (Gan Hanshen's garden), I once ate hot noodle dumplings made by the old Zhu Jiangcun's Huai chef. The skin was thin and the filling was fresh. Compared with Yang snacks, it had a different flavor. In Beiping, there is a kind of handcart that sells hot noodle dumplings. There is a steamer on the cart, steaming with hot air. With a shout, not only ordinary people surround it to eat, but also servants of large mansions hold utensils to buy it. This is one of the snacks of the old capital, and I am very fond of it. Last year, a small newspaper reported that Dr. Mei liked to eat hot noodle dumplings and specially hired a chef from Beiping to make this snack. I don't know that Huai dumplings are even better than those made in Beiping.</p>
<p>In the 20th year of the Republic of China, there was a great flood in the Yangtze River area. At that time, Hu Pu'an was the Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department. Because I had helped Feng Xu with disaster relief, he asked me to investigate the disasters in the six counties of Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Huaicheng, Huaiyin, and Siyang. I went with Commissioner Yuan, who was sent by the Ministry of Interior. In the hot weather of July, we investigated the disaster to the "Hexia" town in Huaiyin. There was a teahouse called "Wenlou" in the town, which was very famous for selling soup dumplings. We went to taste them. The way they were made was different from those in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. Those in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou were small, but these were especially large. A cage was placed on the table, and when the lid was opened, there were more than a dozen. The waiter used his fingers to lift the top of each one, reaching two or three inches high, and placed it on a five-inch plate in front of each person. The soup dumpling flattened out, almost occupying the entire plate. We bit a corner of it and slowly sipped it. The broth was abundant and exceptionally delicious. Those who were not good at eating it would splash the broth all over their sleeves. At that time, a certain gentleman from the county government led us to eat this famous snack, saying, "There is a story about eating Huaiyin soup dumplings, which is very funny. People in the inland areas eat morning tea or afternoon tea in hot weather, mostly shirtless. A foreigner who was eating this for the first time bit a hole in it, and unfortunately the broth splashed on the back of a diner next to him, the oil dripping. The waiter intended to wipe it with a towel, but the diner told him to wait a moment. The waiter asked why, and the person said, "He hasn't eaten it yet!" This shows the characteristics of this famous snack in Huaiyin, which is different from the ordinary small soup dumplings in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou.</p>
<h3>Can You Hold It?</h3>

<h3>Foreign Objects in the Human Body</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenjiang</p>
<p>I happened to see in Shenbao's Free Talk a report about a prisoner in a certain place in France who, in order to commit suicide, swallowed two can openers, a pair of fire tongs that had been broken into ten pieces, five four-inch-long nails, as well as spiral nails and broken pieces of glass from wine bottles. As a result, he was rescued and did not die.</p>
<p>Regarding this kind of example, it is often seen in medicine. All these kinds of things are called "foreign objects" or "foreign bodies." The most common is accidentally swallowing dentures, as well as swallowing buttons, gold rings, etc. In Winnipeg, Canada, there was a Chinese overseas Chinese who accidentally swallowed a knife and fork with his food while eating. However, when the abdomen was opened, only the knife was seen and the fork was not, which was considered a strange story.</p>
<p>In the London Museum of Medical History, I saw an egg cup (about seven or eight centimeters high), which was swallowed by a sixty-year-old man thirty-five years ago. He felt a blockage in the ileocecal region and had his abdomen opened to remove it. I also saw that a ten-year-old girl had many accidentally swallowed objects removed from her stomach after it was opened (about one or two hundred nails, each one inch and half an inch long, as well as safety pins, feathers, and other scattered objects). As a result, she was also cured. The foreign objects on display in the museum also included scissors, pieces of glass, thermometers, insects, knives, copper coins, glasses, watches, etc., a dazzling array that could not be counted.</p>
<p>Regarding examples of swallowing a particularly large number of foreign objects, according to Eastman Cheesy, there was a mental patient who swallowed a total of 157 sharp pieces of glass, each five centimeters long, 120 brass safety pins, 150 rusty iron needles, three needles, 15 pieces of iron of varying sizes, brass, boot buckles, curtain hooks, etc. However, after eight months, they were all excreted through the anus.</p>
<p>In the past, anyone in China who collected ginseng or managed a treasury often handed ginseng and gold jewelry to others and hid them in the rectum through the anus and brought them out. This can certainly be regarded as a type of foreign object.</p>
<p>When surgeons perform abdominal surgery, if they do not pay special attention to knives, scissors, tweezers, gauze, etc., there is often a risk of accidentally sewing them into the abdomen.</p>
<p>If foreign objects enter the digestive system, laxatives must not be taken to prevent perforation of the stomach and intestines, leading to peritonitis. It is more appropriate to swallow them with rice balls or potatoes. The best method, of course, is to perform an X-ray examination to determine the location and then perform abdominal surgery. However, I have also encountered a strange thing. After a patient swallowed a gold ring, it was confirmed without error on X-ray, but when the abdomen was opened, there was no such thing in the stomach and intestines. It turned out that he had had a bowel movement once and had already excreted the ring.</p>
<h3>Loss of Decency</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>According to a report in this newspaper on the 20th: "A teacher from a provincial high school in Taipei resigned due to financial pressures and became a worker in the US Consulate in Taiwan, responsible for wiping windows and sweeping floors, with a monthly salary of several million Taiwan dollars converted from US dollars."</p>
<p>The teacher was willing to become a coolie, doing menial work, because the salary was not enough, which really fits a common saying, called "loss of decency"!</p>
<p>After years of hard study and teaching others, the treatment he received was so meager that he could not support his family. But once he practiced "loss of decency", he could live without worry. This era is truly the year of "loss of decency". What else is there to say?</p>
<h3>Food Grand View Garden</h3>
<p>— Jing Xin</p>
<p>Eating is not just about filling your stomach, but also about whether the taste is good or not. Due to the different local specialties, there are also differences in the taste of food. Every place, every nation, has a special flavor of food. In several large cities, where people from all directions gather, you can taste the special delicacies of various places; but in a restaurant, you cannot eat the flavors of different places.</p>
<p>In New York, there is a "Cui Shi Hotel" that collects the essence of food from various ethnic groups and makes dishes of various flavors for guests. New York has a population of four million, half of whom have parents who are foreigners or grew up abroad. These many main displays allow the Cui Shi Hotel to do very good business.</p>
<p>When you step into the Cui Shi Hotel and sit down, the waiter will send you a menu. You will be surprised when you see the menu. It is a thick book with densely printed words; if you are not prepared in advance and don't know which dish to order, it will take a lot of time just to flip through it. In that "menu", there are more than 25,000 kinds of dishes, including French-style Napoleon pancakes, Italian beeswax spaghetti, German-style steaks, Spanish lettuce, Norwegian seafood... as well as Indian cuisine, Turkish cuisine, Japanese cuisine, everything. Chinese cuisine is world-renowned, of course, it is indispensable. The menu also lists egg foo young and chop suey. Can these two dishes represent Chinese cuisine? That is impossible to judge except by the Chinese themselves.</p>
<p>The layout of the Cui Shi Hotel, in addition to a large restaurant that can accommodate 5,000 diners, also has many rooms. The layout of the rooms is not only different, but also shows the scenery of various places. Some have a tropical atmosphere, with lush palms and coconut groves painted on the walls, and the colors are matched to look like summer. That is where you eat tropical dishes. Some are decorated as cold landscapes, with artificial ice and cotton-made snow, adding to the cold atmosphere. That is where you eat northern dishes. Guests not only eat special side dishes, but also feel as if they are in a foreign country, which adds a lot of fun to the meal.</p>
<p>Although the diners at the Cui Shi Hotel can all speak English, in order to make the local atmosphere more intimate, the waiters try their best not to speak English, but to speak the local language. Therefore, the waiters are specially trained to speak many different languages. The most can speak more than 40 different dialects. To others, they are all linguistic experts.</p>
<p>To cook different dishes from various places, you must have local chefs so that the taste of the side dishes will not change. Therefore, the Cui Shi Hotel's more than 100 chefs include more than 70 different nationalities. Some of them are masters among the chefs in that area. Several chefs are divided into a group and are responsible for the side dishes of that area. Therefore, although there are many dishes on the menu, each chef only cooks a few kinds.</p>
<p>Raw materials such as fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, and seasonings, in addition to the ordinary ones, are also purchased from the local area. The Cui Shi Hotel has a large storage room that hides various products from all over the world. Almost everything that can be eaten can be found there. The Cui Shi Hotel is truly a collection of the world's food.</p>
