<h3>中共廣播對和平意見　談判地點將在北平　共方代表人選則未宣布</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕此間政界人士廿五日晚獲悉中共發言人對和談問題之談話後，認爲和平前途頗有可爲，該發言人雖對政府仍有批評，但並無拒絕與政府談判之表示。李代總統廿二日文吿中曾稱：「至於中共方面所提八條件，政府願卽開始商談」。中共發言人亦稱，願在一月十四日毛澤東對時局聲明基礎之上，與政府談判和平解決的問題，足證雙方之距離並非過遠。該人士並指出，兩黨證明中共發言人之談話，已表示可與政府進行談判，其一爲暗示談判地點將在北平，此點殆卽對政院決議之答覆。另一爲拒絕接待彭昭賢爲和談代表，此點暗示中共對邵·張·黃·鍾四代表並無拒絕之意，惟可遺憾者，中共方面尙未迅速明白宣布其代表團人選及明示指定北平爲和談地點，故政府代表團未便迅卽前往北平，準備談判也。惟另一部份人士則對中共之反應略感悲觀，因彼等認爲如雙方果眞「相忍爲國」，在政府已一再以行動表示謀和之決心後，卽不當再以宣傳口吻漫肆批評，而應立卽以現政府爲對象，迅速促成和談，停止作戰，出人民於水火，惟彼等認爲，中共之反應並未提及李代總統文吿及廿一日頒布之諸項措施，如中共於了解政府之新措施後，相信其態度當有所改變。</p>
<p>〔合衆社本埠訊〕中共電台廿五日晚暗示共方同意在北平開始和平談判，但此未能鼓舞政府之和平擁護人士。此乃共方答覆政府要求談判地址中第一次提及北平與和談之關係。同時，共方對毛澤東聲明之第一點戰爭罪犯名單一節非但不可能妥協，而將予增加，此將使政府之和平努力成泡形。</p>
<p>政府和談代表邵力子稱：渠尙無時間可仔細研究中共廿五日晚廣播，不能予以評述，一切全盤之決議，須由政府決定。又稱：「但是，渠略窺中共文吿後，渠仍希望中共將早日宣布開始和談之確定地址及時間」。</p>
<p>「渠認爲共產黨應多注重輕减人民之疾苦，少在戰爭罪犯上計較」。</p>
<p>據悉：若行政院決定中共廿五日之聲明乃毛澤東之不能改變其意見之眞正表示，邵力子認爲渠除辭職外，無他途可循。又悉：邵氏希望政府將不致立卽中斷其和平努力，繼續從事覓可取能仍未關閉之若干路徑。</p>
<h3>中共發言人談話　陜北新華電台廣播全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕政府和談代表派定後，共產黨宣傳機關新華社廿五日廣播中共發言人對此事之反應，中央社記者當以其內容就詢某觀察家意見，據稱：依據中共發言人之表示，中共對全面和平問題，依然缺乏誠意，且意圖延宕和談之進行，茲將新華社廣播全文披露，以待全國人民之研討與公斷：</p>
<p>「新華社陝北廿五日電，據南京國民黨反動政府的中央通訊社廿二日報道，這個反動政府的行政院，已於廿二日推翻了它自己在十九日所作若不先行停戰便不願意進行談判的那個荒謬決議，而重新決定派遣五個代表，向中國共產黨進行談判，這五個代表是邵力子·張治中·黃紹竑·彭昭賢·鍾天心。中共發言人稱：我們願意在一月十四日毛澤東主席對時局聲明的基礎之上，和南京反動政府談判和平解決的問題，南京反動政府應負發動反革命內戰的全部責任，全國人民對於這個政府，早已完全喪失信任，這個政府早已沒有代表中國人民的資格，有資格代表中國人民的政府，只能是由卽將召開的沒有反動分子參加的新的政治協商會議所產生的民主聯合政府。因此，我們允許南京反動政府派出代表和我們進行談判，不是承認這個政府還有代表中國人民的資格，而是因爲這個政府手裏還有一部分反動的殘餘軍事力量，如果這個政府感於自己已經完全喪失人民的信任，感於它手裏的殘餘反動軍事力量已經無法抵抗强大的人民解放軍，而願意接受中共的八個和平條件的話，那麽用談判的方法去解決問題，使人民少受痛苦，當然是比較好的和有利於人民解放事業的。最近，北平問題的和平解決，就是一個實例，但是南京反動政府是否願意接受中共所提出的反映全國人民公意的八個條件，現在誰也不知道。現在所知道的，就是在南京反動政府方面放出了許多虛偽的裝腔作勢的和平空氣，企岡欺騙人民，以達其保存反動勢力，獲得喘息機會，然後捲土重來，撲滅革命力量之目的，全國人民應有淸醒的頭腦，決不可被那些僞善的空談所迷惑。談判的地點，要待北平完全解放後，才能確定，大約將在北平。彭昭賢是主戰最力的國民黨CC派的主要幹部之一，人們認爲是一個戰爭罪犯，中共方面不能接待這樣的代表。關於戰爭罪犯名單問題，中共發言人稱，我們尙未發表全部戰爭罪犯名單，去年十二月二十五日新華社發表的，僅僅是第一批名單，發動內戰殘殺人民的國民黨反動派中的主要負責人員，決不止四十三個」。</p>
<h3>總統巡視舊第　今族人父老</h3>
<p>〔中央社溪口廿五日電〕蔣總統今日未外出遊覽，下午三時許，始驅車至豐鎬房舊第及附近巡視一週，蔣經國挈次男愛民隨來，四時許卽返墓廬，又，蔣總統定廿六日晚在舊第設席，招待族人曁鎭上父老。</p>
<h3>李代總統向四監委表示　和平「盡其在我」　只要多作努力總可實現</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕監委谷鳳翔·任秉鈞·何濬周·王向辰廿五日下午三時晋謁李代總統，除就監院對當前時局之意見有所陳述外，並與代總統商談有關和談進行之各項問題。據悉：李代總統曾表示，政府頃正靜候中共之反應，俟地點決定後，政府首批代表卽可前往進行和談之初步協商，至將來和談廣泛展開以後，政府所派代表自不足應付繁重工作，故勢將再選派人民代表相繼前往。代總統對和平之信心，係採取「盡其在我」之態度。代總統認爲，只要我們多作努力，和平總可實現。四監委訪問歸來後表示，代總統對當前局勢之分析尙感滿意。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕立委尹述賢·陳博生·范予遂等，頃正擬就有關和談之根本基礎數項，將送請政府所派和談代表團採用，該項建議約列以次數點：（一）保陣人民自由權。（二）保障國家獨立，領土完整。（三）加强對美·蘇關係，避免轉入世界戰渦。（四）融合三民主義與新民主主義爲建國理論基礎，該項建議書可望於廿六日送出。</p>
<h3>黃紹竑即來京</h3>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據行政院新聞局上海辦事處息：新聞局局長沈昌煥，業已向孫院長呈請辭職，並聞辭意甚堅。</p>
<h3>李品仙飛京</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿五日電〕華中剿總副總司令李品仙廿四日午離漢飛京，聞李氏此行將代表白總司令向中樞有所商請，至外傳白氏已晋京說實卽李氏行蹤之訛傳。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕京滬杭警備總司令湯恩伯，廿五日晨自滬返抵京，並卽於上午晋謁李代總統，報吿長江防務，並有所請示。</p>
<h3>楊受源返并</h3>
<p>行前曾與李代總統長談</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕代表閻錫山駐京之太原綏署副主任楊愛源，廿五日上午九時乘機返幷。楊氏返幷前曾於廿四日晚晋謁李代總統，長談一小時許。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原廿五日電〕楊愛源於去歲十月中旬幷垣保衛戰激烈進行之際晋京，茲以公畢，廿五日下午專機由京飛返抵幷。據楊氏語記者，中央對晋省最缺乏之食糧等，決予大量源源接濟。</p>
<h3>豫鄂間情勢趨緊　共軍續舞陽方城移動　劉伯承部窺陜圖積極</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿五日電〕豫南鄂北情勢略現緊張，劉伯承，陳賡兩部共軍一股，續向舞陽方城及南陽一帶移動，國軍嚴守監視態度，迄今尙無大接觸。</p>
<p>〔本報信陽廿五日電〕軍息：回竄豫南共軍，經判明計有前屬劉伯承部之四。六兩縱隊，及新近整補之陳賡部四·九兩縱隊，廿一日劉部六縱隊一旅已竄抵桐柏山區。（二）據軍方負責人吿記者，共軍對豫南加重壓力，其企圖顯在威脅武漢，但豫南軍民決本白總司令言和不忘備戰之旨，堅定防禦崗位，以盡保境安民重責，豫張軫主席今因公赴漢。</p>
<p>〔本報西安廿五日電〕共軍劉伯承部窺陝積極，其六十一·廿二兩旅，廿二日自鄂西北陷縣河舖，先頭已抵保豐，有竄陝南安康企圖。</p>
<h3>國軍主動撤至最後方綫　共軍再南侵決迎擊　國防部發言人已發出警告</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕國防部發言人廿五日稱：自行政院決議無條件停戰後，國軍卽於十九日晚自動撤離蚌埠，共軍繼續南侵，國軍爲遵從政府進行和談決議，避免人民塗炭，復於廿三日撤離滁縣，廿四日晚撤離揚州，退守長江北岸地區。國軍官兵咸望共軍亦能罷戰休兵，解人民於倒懸。長江防務經半年餘之部署，已極鞏固，我强大海陸空軍憑藉長江天險，實有堅守把握，猶憶民國十六年八月寗漢分立時，總統亦曾下野，孫傳芳以十餘萬大軍渡江南犯，龍潭一役，竟全軍被我國民革命軍殲滅，當時我僅有部隊一·七兩軍及兩艘小艦，現國軍有十數軍完整之部隊，加以空軍配合作戰，共軍如仍違背人民和平意志，繼續南犯，國軍當予迎頭痛擊，共軍定難逃歷史覆轍，其主力必將被殲滅於長江沿綫。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿五日電〕國防部長徐永昌警吿政府稱：南京在五日內將能聽到共軍之槍砲聲，李代總統已自安徽等臨近省份調來援軍若干師，以拱衛首都。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕津浦南段國軍爲促成雙方迅速言和停戰，於將主力主動的撤至最後防棧的滁河南岸後，頃已完成最周密部署。該河位於花旗營車站以北，距浦口達卅餘華里，距下關在四十華里以上，卽使共軍中射程最遠之十五點六公分重砲，亦無法轟及下關，遑論南京城內。故某軍事觀察家特爲此囑記者轉吿京市本報讀者，固無須祀人憂天，自亂步驟。至合山，全椒兩縣城，因不在國軍應守最後防綫以內，已於廿二日，廿四日兩晚自動撤守。</p>
<p>〔本報浦鎭廿五日電〕津浦路正面，據廿五日晚所得報吿，僅有共軍陳毅部新一及十二兩個縱隊，在淮河北岸六·，九·十三等三個縱隊，尙在整補中，迄無南下跡象可尋。至劉伯承部主力，早經蒙城向華中行進，陳毅部主力則在蘇北。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿五日電〕外國軍艦現有兩艘泊於江中，一艘爲英艦「黑天鵝」號，另一艘爲美驅逐運輸艦。據英美大使館稱，該兩艦係「準備應付必要用途」</p>

<p>〔本報鎭江廿五日電〕確悉：一　之隔之古城揚州駐軍，已於廿四夜十時撤守，十一時許共軍一部份由北郊突入城內，並未遭遇任何抵抗。廿五日黎明，揚州軍政機關最後一批人員，安全由六圩乘普濟輪南來，現輪渡仍加班開至六圩，裝載未及登輪之旅客及難民，特於廿六日裝完後，鎭圩交通卽宣吿中斷，江都縣府已在鎭設臨時辦公處，專員公署·蘇西師管區等機關亦遷鎭。據廿五晚由六圩來人談，共軍進入揚城後，已責令商會組織商團，維持秩序，揚州十三個城門，現僅開放一福運門，共軍對城內民衆並未檢查。又，共軍一連，已進至揚州六圩間之施家橋公路（離六圩江岸十五華里），現海軍江防砲艇正急切注視行動中。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭汪廿五日電〕儀徵方面二十五日晨情况不明，電報電話中斷，縣長左治人正堅苦率部應戰，十二圩·瓜州仍在駐軍手中。</p>
<p>〔本報江陰廿五日電〕黃田港廿五日下午三時已全面封鎖，靖江各機關人員已疏散，澄地安靜，惟聞江北槍砲聲時斷時續。</p>

<h3>日本普選揭曉</h3>
<p>本月二十三日舉行之日本衆議院議員普選，全部結果已經揭曉了。在四六六名議員名額中，民主自由黨佔二六三席，民主黨佔七十席，社會黨佔四九席，共產黨佔三五席，協同載佔一四席，勞農黨佔七席，社會革新黨佔五席，其他較小政黨無黨派合得二四席。無疑義的，民自黨已在此次普選中，獲得絕對的優勢，依照日本憲法規定，第一黨有組閣的權力，是以至二月十五日開會後，吉田茂必將蟬聯，已成定局了。</p>
<p>前屆議會議員，產生於一九四六年四月，解散於去年十二月下旬。在此將及三年中，衆院各黨派所佔勢力的分野，說明日本政治的變化。當議會組織之先，社會黨曾以一四三席而躍居第一黨的地位，後因內部分化，祗剩一一〇席左右而退爲第二黨，此次社會黨一落千丈，僅當選四九席，計喪失六十二席。當時會以一三〇各屈居第二黨的自由黨，後因實力增加改名爲民主自由黨，在議會增加至一五〇席，而躍居爲第一黨了。此次民自黨在普選中獲勝，計增一一三席，佔全部隊員之半數。其他黨派，除共產黨外，皆因悲歡離合，發生了幾席的變化。原屬民主黨的幣原派，投奔了民自黨，後因蘆田均一度被捕而聲名狼籍，多數民主黨議員，改隸了民自黨，如非犬養健出而繼承民主黨的領導，民主黨甚有全部瓦解可能。民主黨最初在議會佔有九十席，此次競選多賴吉田茂的支持，保持了七十席，僥倖獲得第二黨的地位。協同黨原在議會佔有二九席，此次普選獲得一四席，幾乎潰不成軍，大約該黨半數以上的保守派，均投奔民自黨的陣營。</p>
<p>綜觀此次普選結果，說明日本政治正在急遽的雙化中，而這一種的變化，一方面說明保守勢力的抬頭，在日本取得絕對壓倒的優勢；另方面說明左翼力量的極端走向共產主義化，共產黨在此次普選中的猛晋，即爲此一事實的明證。在今天的日本政治中，代表保守勢力陣營的，當推吉田茂領導的民自黨，他是日本的極右派，不僅反共產反民主，並且主張崇信天皇和恢復軍國主義體制的。民自黨此次的競選勝利，是由於麥帥政策的鼓勵，及社會民主兩黨因多次貪汚案失去了選民的信仰，於是大多的選票，都被民自黨吸引而去了，這也說明今天日本的人民，其「忠君愛國」的心理，恢復舊形態的觀念，並無絲亳的改變，而且是愈益迷信保守勢力了。在另一事實中，共產黨原在議會佔有四席，毫無發言力量，且其羣衆基礎脆弱，一切勞工勞農的活動，概在社會黨左派的掌握。此次普選結果，社會黨領袖片山哲不僅落選，甚至左派加藤勘十，墅溝勝等亦均落選，大約工農的選票，都已投奔了共產黨，所以共產黨能從四席一躍爲三五席，較前約增九倍。另一左翼政黨即勞農黨，係與共產黨同一陣綫的，此次亦得七席，兩黨合計爲四二席，將來在新議會中，可能結成左翼聯合陣綫，而爲政府的唯一反對黨。民主黨的未來動向，可能趨向民自黨，社會黨必在中間兩難的情况下，爲左右所厭棄，祗有日愈衰落之一途了。總之，此次日本普選的勝利，屬於民自黨與共產黨，一邊是極右的勝利，一邊是極左的勝利，而兩者的對立性與不可妥協性，祗有日益加深發展的。日本政治的現狀是如此，未來的趨勢亦復如此。</p>

<h3>英商電車工人　堅持借薪半月　當決不考局定予慮　各路車午後始出廠行駛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕法商電事工潮事告解決，英商電車又因借薪問題引起風波·昨日上午英商各路有軌無軌電車未有出廠，經靜安寺警察分局勸導後，於下午一時半開出，但各路電車均實行發售「平價票」，不鑰遠近，一律三元，至晚復提平進廠·該廠六十九號開車邵昌元昨晨去靜安寺重廠接班時，因工潮而致氣急昏厥不治身死。工人方面指係因聞借薪半月不遂，以致氣急身死云。</p>
<p>社會局趙副局長認爲工人罷工怠工行動，係少數人從中滋事毫無理由，除儘量盡勸導責任外，對工人所提借薪半月之要求，已請示吳市長，決定不予考慮。罷工怠工期間工資，絕對不給。如工人仍不復工，湯總司令已有指示，決定將該案移由軍事機關處理。</p>
<p>據趙副局長談稱：「本市各公用事業資方經濟情形現均不佳，此次職工年獎係由市府設法向中央銀行接洽貸款三千六百萬元後，各公司方始於二十·廿一兩日發出。公用事業職工年獎係按一月份指數計算，已較其他各業優越，但職工又提出要求按年常舊規於舊曆年底借薪半月，公司無錢支付，法商電車職工卽於二十四日發生罷工情形，湯總司令吳市長陳司令聞訊均頗震怒，經與中央農工部陸副部長會同召集六大公司事業代表，於二十四日下午經五小時半之商討，決定一月份下半月薪提前於舊曆年前發出，此外並預支七天半薪金，仍由市府接洽，由中央銀行貸款予各公司發給，當時各工會代表對此均已滿意。詎英商電車一部份工人聞訊後，竟指工會代表得資方賄賂二十八墓元後故允將借薪半月之要求降爲七天半，於是羣情憤慨，發生罷工情形，六十九號開車邵昌元因反對罷工，欲開車出廠，被人圍阻，當塲氣急昏厥，送醫院救治無效身死。工人遂除要求借薪半月外，並要求從優撫恤邵昌元，現除借薪半月要求不予考慮外，邵昌元爲同情工會代表而死，自當從優撫恤」。</p>

<h3>外匯移轉證買賣交易　國行不欲取消限制　但可負責維持一定價格</h3>
<p>關於進出口業要求取消央行一七〇號　函一節，據央行當局表示，此次限制移轉證之交易，其旨在防止非經營進出口業務之人，從中混入，操縱移轉證價格，故有是項限制。此種限制，依理必須存在，惟爲維護移轉證一定價格，以達協助出口自由，中行對於外匯移轉證，自然須負起調節限制之作用。</p>
<h3>銀根走勢雖鬆　現鈔仍見缺乏</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根，走勢續鬆，市間頭寸供源旺盛，需單亦冗，週轉頻繁。市塲暗息，在日拆四十元至五十元間，近午卅五元，亦有供出。但如現鈔交拆，均做五十元。業內行莊，日來供出短期頭寸不絕，聞最近星期存款，又大吃香。</p>
<p>據金融界訊：最近一週來，外埠匯款到滬者，數在十億元左右。工貸發放，數在三億元，而國庫支撥，數在六億元左右。故本市銀根鬆弛異常。</p>
<p>中央銀行昨起雖已發行百元新券一種，但市間現鈔匱象，並未全退，本票仍見流行，貼水在百分之四左右。又悉：現鈔缺乏原因頗多，其較顯著者，厥爲農曆年關，返鄕旅客，均須携帶相當數目。又接濟外埠家用，而在郵局投寄報値郵件（按每信可附五百元）者，週來頗爲擁擠云。</p>

<h3>CCP Broadcast on Peace Proposals: Negotiation Location to Be in Beiping, CCP Representative Candidates Yet to Be Announced</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Political circles here learned on the evening of the 25th of the CCP spokesperson's comments on the peace talks issue, believing that the prospects for peace are quite promising. Although the spokesperson still had criticisms of the government, there was no indication of refusing to negotiate with the government. Acting President Li stated in his proclamation on the 22nd: "As for the eight conditions proposed by the CCP, the government is willing to begin discussions immediately." The CCP spokesperson also stated that they are willing to negotiate with the government on resolving the issue of peace on the basis of Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation on January 14th, which proves that the distance between the two sides is not too far. These individuals also pointed out that the two parties prove that the CCP spokesperson's remarks have indicated that negotiations can be conducted with the government. One is that it implies that the negotiation location will be in Beiping, which is almost a response to the Executive Yuan's resolution. The other is that they refused to receive Peng Zhaoxian as a peace talk representative, which implies that the CCP has no objection to the four representatives Shao, Zhang, Huang, and Zhong. However, regrettably, the CCP has not yet quickly and clearly announced the candidates for its delegation and explicitly designated Beiping as the negotiation location, so the government delegation cannot quickly go to Beiping to prepare for negotiations. However, another group of people felt slightly pessimistic about the CCP's response, because they believe that if both sides truly "bear with each other for the sake of the country," after the government has repeatedly expressed its determination to seek peace through actions, it should no longer criticize in a propaganda tone but should immediately take the current government as the target, quickly promote peace talks, stop the war, and rescue the people from suffering. However, they believe that the CCP's response did not mention Acting President Li's proclamation and the various measures announced on the 21st. If the CCP understands the government's new measures, it is believed that its attitude will change.</p>
<p>[United Press, This Location] The CCP radio station hinted on the evening of the 25th that the CCP agreed to start peace talks in Beiping, but this did not encourage government peace advocates. This is the first time the CCP has mentioned the relationship between Beiping and peace talks in response to the government's request for a negotiation location. At the same time, the CCP stated that not only is the first point of Mao Zedong's statement, the list of war criminals, impossible to compromise, but it will also be increased, which will make the government's peace efforts futile.</p>
<p>Government peace talk representative Shao Lizi stated: He has no time to carefully study the CCP broadcast on the evening of the 25th and cannot comment on it. All overall decisions must be made by the government. He also said: "However, after glimpsing the CCP document, he still hopes that the CCP will announce the confirmed location and time for the start of peace talks as soon as possible."</p>
<p>"He believes that the Communist Party should pay more attention to reducing the suffering of the people and less focus on calculating war criminals."</p>
<p>It is reported that if the Executive Yuan decides that the CCP's statement on the 25th is a true expression of Mao Zedong's inability to change his mind, Shao Lizi believes that he has no choice but to resign. It is also reported that Shao hopes that the government will not immediately interrupt its peace efforts and continue to seek any viable paths that have not yet been closed.</p>
<h3>CCP Spokesperson's Remarks: Full Text Broadcast by Xinhua Radio Station in Northern Shaanxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] After the government peace talk representatives were appointed, the CCP propaganda organ Xinhua News Agency broadcast on the 25th the CCP spokesperson's response to this matter. The Central News Agency reporter consulted an observer for their opinion on the content. According to the CCP spokesperson's statement, the CCP still lacks sincerity regarding the issue of comprehensive peace and intends to delay the progress of peace talks. The full text of the Xinhua News Agency broadcast is disclosed for discussion and judgment by the people of the whole country:</p>
<p>"Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: According to a report by the Central News Agency of the reactionary Nationalist government in Nanjing on the 22nd, the Executive Yuan of this reactionary government overturned on the 22nd its own absurd decision made on the 19th that it was unwilling to conduct negotiations without first ceasing fire, and re-decided to send five representatives to conduct negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party. These five representatives are Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, Peng Zhaoxian, and Zhong Tianxin. The CCP spokesperson stated: We are willing to negotiate with the reactionary government in Nanjing on the basis of Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation on January 14th to resolve the issue of peace. The reactionary government in Nanjing should bear full responsibility for launching the counter-revolutionary civil war. The people of the whole country have long completely lost trust in this government. This government is no longer qualified to represent the Chinese people. The only government qualified to represent the Chinese people is the democratic coalition government produced by the new political consultative conference to be convened without the participation of reactionary elements. Therefore, our permission for the reactionary government in Nanjing to send representatives to negotiate with us is not an acknowledgment that this government is still qualified to represent the Chinese people, but because this government still has some reactionary residual military power in its hands. If this government feels that it has completely lost the trust of the people and that its residual reactionary military power is no longer able to resist the powerful People's Liberation Army, and is willing to accept the eight peace conditions proposed by the CCP, then it is of course better and more beneficial to the cause of the people's liberation to resolve the problem through negotiation and reduce the suffering of the people. Recently, the peaceful resolution of the Beiping issue is an example. However, no one knows whether the reactionary government in Nanjing is willing to accept the eight conditions proposed by the CCP that reflect the public opinion of the people of the whole country. What is known now is that the reactionary government in Nanjing has released a lot of hypocritical and pretentious peace talk to deceive the people in order to achieve its goal of preserving reactionary forces, gaining a respite, and then making a comeback to extinguish the revolutionary forces. The people of the whole country should have a clear head and must not be confused by those hypocritical empty talks. The location of the negotiations will be determined only after Beiping is completely liberated, and it will probably be in Beiping. Peng Zhaoxian is one of the main cadres of the Kuomintang CC faction who is most supportive of war. People consider him a war criminal, and the CCP cannot receive such a representative. Regarding the issue of the list of war criminals, the CCP spokesperson stated that we have not yet published the full list of war criminals. What Xinhua News Agency published on December 25 last year was only the first batch of names. The main responsible persons in the Kuomintang reactionaries who launched the civil war and brutally murdered the people are definitely not limited to 43 people."</p>
<h3>President Inspects Old Residence: Meets with Clansmen and Elders</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xikou, 25th] President Chiang did not go out for sightseeing today. Around 3:00 PM, he drove to the Fenghao House old residence and inspected the surrounding area for a week. Chiang Ching-kuo brought his second son, Aimin, with him. They returned to the tomb hut around 4:00 PM. In addition, President Chiang has scheduled a banquet at the old residence on the evening of the 26th to entertain clansmen and elders in the town.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li Expresses to Four Supervisory Committee Members: Peace "Depends Entirely on Ourselves": It Can Be Achieved as Long as More Efforts Are Made</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang, Ren Bingjun, He Junzhou, and Wang Xiangchen paid a visit to Acting President Li at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 25th. In addition to presenting the Supervisory Yuan's views on the current situation, they also discussed various issues related to the peace talks with the Acting President. It is reported that Acting President Li stated that the government is currently waiting for the CCP's response. After the location is determined, the government's first batch of representatives can go to conduct preliminary consultations on the peace talks. After the peace talks are widely launched in the future, the representatives sent by the government will naturally be insufficient to cope with the heavy workload, so people's representatives will be selected and sent one after another. The Acting President's confidence in peace is based on the attitude of "depending entirely on ourselves." The Acting President believes that as long as we make more efforts, peace can always be achieved. The four Supervisory Committee members stated after returning from their visit that they were satisfied with the Acting President's analysis of the current situation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Legislators Yin Shuxian, Chen Bosheng, Fan Yushui, and others are currently planning to submit several fundamental principles related to peace talks to the government-appointed peace talk delegation for adoption. The recommendations are listed as follows: (1) Protect the people's freedom. (2) Guarantee national independence and territorial integrity. (3) Strengthen relations with the United States and the Soviet Union and avoid being drawn into a world war. (4) Integrate the Three Principles of the People and New Democracy as the theoretical foundation for national construction. The recommendations are expected to be sent out on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaohong to Arrive in Nanjing Soon</h3>
<p>Peng Zhaoxian Resigns as Peace Talk Representative</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Huang Shaohong, one of the representatives appointed to the government peace talk delegation, arrived in Hankou from Hong Kong on the 25th and will come to Nanjing today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Peng Zhaoxian, one of the five government peace talk representatives, visited Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong yesterday and asked them to request his resignation from President Sun on his behalf.</p>
<h3>Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau: Shen Changhuan Resigns</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] According to the Shanghai office of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau: Shen Changhuan, Director of the Information Bureau, has submitted his resignation to President Sun, and it is said that his intention to resign is firm.</p>
<h3>Li Pinxian Flies to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 25th] Li Pinxian, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Central China剿匪總司令部 (Bandit Suppression Headquarters), left Hankou by plane on the afternoon of the 24th to fly to Nanjing. It is reported that Li will represent Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi to consult with the central government. The rumors that Bai has already gone to Nanjing are actually a misinterpretation of Li's whereabouts.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 25th and immediately paid a visit to Acting President Li in the morning to report on the defense of the Yangtze River and make some requests.</p>

<h3>Tensions Increase Between Henan and Hubei: Communist Army Continues to Move in Wuyang and Fangcheng: Liu Bocheng's Troops Actively Plotting to Invade Shaanxi</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 25th] The situation in southern Henan and northern Hubei is slightly tense. A contingent of the Communist army under Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng continues to move towards Wuyang, Fangcheng, and Nanyang. The National Army is closely monitoring the situation, and there has been no major contact so far.</p>
<p>[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 25th] Military sources: It has been determined that the Communist army that fled back to southern Henan includes the 4th and 6th Columns, formerly under Liu Bocheng, and the 4th and 9th Columns under Chen Geng, which have recently been reorganized. A brigade of Liu's 6th Column has already fled to the Tongbai Mountains on the 21st. (2) According to a person in charge of the military, the Communist army's increased pressure on southern Henan is clearly aimed at threatening Wuhan. However, the soldiers and civilians in southern Henan are determined to uphold Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi's message of preparing for war while seeking peace, and firmly defend their positions to fulfill their important responsibility of protecting the territory and the people. Chairman Zhang Zhen of Henan Province went to Hankou today for official business.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 25th] Liu Bocheng's Communist army is actively plotting to invade Shaanxi. Its 61st and 22nd Brigades captured Hexipu, a county in northwestern Hubei, on the 22nd. The vanguard has reached Baofeng and intends to invade Ankang in southern Shaanxi.</p>
<h3>National Army Actively Withdraws to the Last Defense Line: Will Counterattack if the Communist Army Invades Further South: Spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense Issues Warning</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense stated on the 25th: Since the Executive Yuan resolved to unconditionally cease fire, the National Army automatically withdrew from Bengbu on the evening of the 19th. The Communist army continued to invade southwards. In order to comply with the government's decision to conduct peace talks and avoid further suffering for the people, the National Army withdrew from Chuxian on the 23rd and from Yangzhou on the evening of the 24th, and retreated to the north bank of the Yangtze River. The officers and soldiers of the National Army hope that the Communist army will also cease fighting and give the people a respite. The defense of the Yangtze River has been extremely consolidated after more than half a year of deployment. Our powerful navy, army, and air force, relying on the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, are confident of holding it firmly. It is still remembered that when the Ninghan split occurred in August of the 16th year of the Republic of China, the President also stepped down, and Sun Chuanfang invaded south with an army of more than 100,000. In the Battle of Longtan, the entire army was annihilated by our National Revolutionary Army. At that time, we only had the 1st and 7th armies and two small ships. Now the National Army has more than a dozen complete armies, with the cooperation of the air force. If the Communist army still violates the people's will for peace and continues to invade south, the National Army will give them a head-on blow. The Communist army will not escape the historical precedent, and its main force will be annihilated along the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang warned the government that Nanjing will be able to hear the sounds of Communist army guns and artillery within five days. Acting President Li has transferred several divisions of reinforcements from neighboring provinces such as Anhui to defend the capital.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] In order to promote a quick ceasefire and peace talks between the two sides, the National Army in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway actively withdrew its main force to the south bank of the Chu River, the last defense line, and has now completed the most thorough deployment. The river is located north of the Huaqiying Railway Station, more than 30 li from Pukou and more than 40 li from Xiaguan. Even the Communist army's longest-range 15.6 cm heavy artillery cannot reach Xiaguan, let alone the city of Nanjing. Therefore, a military observer specially asked this reporter to tell the readers of this newspaper in Nanjing that there is no need to worry unnecessarily and disrupt our plans. As for the cities of Heshan and Quanjiao, since they are not within the last defense line that the National Army should defend, they were automatically evacuated on the evenings of the 22nd and 24th.</p>
<p>[Our Puzhen Dispatch, 25th] On the Jinpu Railway front, according to reports obtained on the evening of the 25th, only the New 1st and 12th Columns of Chen Yi's Communist army are on the north bank of the Huai River. The 6th, 9th, and 13th Columns are still being reorganized and there is no sign of them heading south. As for the main force of Liu Bocheng's army, they have long marched towards Central China via Mengcheng, while the main force of Chen Yi's army is in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] There are currently two foreign warships docked in the river, one is the British warship "Black Swan" and the other is an American destroyer transport ship. According to the British and American embassies, the two ships are "prepared for necessary purposes."</p>

<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 25th] Confirmed: The garrison in the ancient city of Yangzhou, separated by one water, evacuated on the night of the 24th at 10:00 PM. Around 11:00 PM, a portion of the Communist army suddenly entered the city from the northern suburbs without encountering any resistance. At dawn on the 25th, the last group of personnel from the Yangzhou military and political organs safely arrived in the south by the Pujie wheel from Liuyi. Currently, the ferry is still operating overtime to Liuyi to load passengers and refugees who have not yet boarded the ship. It is expected to be fully loaded on the 26th, and then traffic in Zhenwei will be announced to be interrupted. The Jiangdu County government has set up a temporary office in Zhen, and organs such as the Commissioner's Office and the Suxi Division 管區 (Administrative District) have also moved to Zhen. According to people who came from Liuyi on the evening of the 25th, after the Communist army entered the city of Yangzhou, they ordered the Chamber of Commerce to organize merchant groups to maintain order. Currently, only one Fuyun Gate is open among the thirteen city gates of Yangzhou. The Communist army did not inspect the residents in the city. In addition, a company of the Communist army has advanced to the Shi Jiaqiao Highway between Yangzhou and Liuyi (15 li from the Liuyi river bank). Currently, the navy's river defense gunboats are closely monitoring their actions.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 25th] The situation in Yizheng was unclear on the morning of the 25th. Telegrams and telephones were cut off. County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren is resolutely leading his troops to fight. Shierwei and Guazhou are still in the hands of the garrison.</p>

<h3>Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong in Frequent Contact in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Judging from various signs, the consultation on the prelude to the peace talks in Shanghai is still in the initial stage of exploring opinions. The realization of figures from the third party going to Nanjing to jointly discuss national affairs still requires continued efforts. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, and Gan Jiehou, a representative of Acting President Li, held a meeting at Qian Xinzhi's residence on Yuyuan Road. Gan gave a detailed report on the negotiations he had conducted in Shanghai in the past two days. Subsequently, Mo Dehui also rushed to the meeting. They reviewed the Northeast issue and the release of Zhang Xueliang. As for whether Mo will serve as a peace talk representative, a decision will be made after further consideration. After the initial meeting, Shao and Zhang, accompanied by Qian Xinzhi, visited Du Yuesheng to inquire about the views of the city's business community on the peace talks. Around 11:00 AM, the two drove to the Hongqiao Sanitarium to visit Zhang Lan and Luo Longji, persons in charge of the China Democratic League in Shanghai. Before the two arrived, Huang Yanpei had already arrived at the hospital around 9:00 AM and had a secret talk with Zhang and Luo for more than an hour. However, Huang did not participate in the meeting between the government representatives and Zhang and Luo. During the meeting, it was heard that the Democratic League's attitude was very calm. They expressed great concern about the members of the League who were arrested in various places, and also expressed their views on the temporary non-revocation of martial law. The meeting ended at 1:00 PM. In the afternoon, Shao and Zhang originally planned to visit Madam Sun Yat-sen to exchange views on the current situation, but because Madam Sun's blood pressure was too high and she felt slightly unwell, the date of the meeting was not determined. The two will visit again after receiving a phone call from Madam Sun. In addition, the two met with Zhang Junmai to discuss matters.</p>
<p>Shao Lizi told reporters that he might return to Nanjing on the 26th.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japanese General Election Results Announced</h3>
<p>The results of the Japanese House of Representatives general election held on the 23rd of this month have been fully revealed. Of the 466 seats, the Democratic Liberal Party won 263 seats, the Democratic Party 70 seats, the Socialist Party 49 seats, the Communist Party 35 seats, the Cooperative Party 14 seats, the Labour-Farmer Party 7 seats, the Social Reform Party 5 seats, and other smaller parties and independents a combined 24 seats. Undoubtedly, the Democratic Liberal Party has gained an absolute advantage in this general election. According to the Japanese Constitution, the leading party has the right to form a cabinet. Therefore, after the meeting on February 15th, Shigeru Yoshida will certainly continue in his role, which has become a certainty.</p>
<p>The previous session of parliament was formed in April 1946 and dissolved in late December last year. In these nearly three years, the distribution of power among the various parties in the House has illustrated the changes in Japanese politics. At the beginning of the parliamentary organization, the Socialist Party, with 143 seats, once rose to become the leading party. Later, due to internal divisions, it was reduced to about 110 seats and relegated to the second largest party. This time, the Socialist Party suffered a drastic decline, winning only 49 seats, a loss of 62 seats. At that time, the Liberal Party, which had 130 seats and ranked second, later changed its name to the Democratic Liberal Party due to increased strength, increasing its seats in parliament to 150 and becoming the leading party. This time, the Democratic Liberal Party won the general election, increasing by 113 seats, accounting for half of all members. All other parties, except the Communist Party, have experienced changes of a few seats due to joys and sorrows, unions and separations. The Kijuro Shidehara faction, originally of the Democratic Party, defected to the Democratic Liberal Party. Later, because Hitoshi Ashida was once arrested and his reputation tarnished, the majority of Democratic Party members transferred their allegiance to the Democratic Liberal Party. If Ken Inukai had not come forward to inherit the leadership of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party might have completely disintegrated. The Democratic Party initially held 90 seats in parliament. This time, it relied heavily on the support of Shigeru Yoshida in the election, retaining 70 seats and narrowly gaining the position of the second largest party. The Cooperative Party originally held 29 seats in parliament. This time, it won 14 seats in the general election, almost collapsing. About half of the party's conservative members defected to the Democratic Liberal Party camp.</p>
<p>Overall, the results of this general election show that Japanese politics are undergoing rapid polarization. This change, on the one hand, shows the rise of conservative forces, gaining an absolute overwhelming advantage in Japan. On the other hand, it shows the extreme left-wing forces moving towards communism. The Communist Party's rapid advancement in this general election is clear evidence of this fact. In today's Japanese politics, the Democratic Liberal Party led by Shigeru Yoshida represents the conservative force camp. He is the extreme right wing in Japan, not only anti-communist and anti-democratic, but also advocates believing in the Emperor and restoring the militarist system. The Democratic Liberal Party's victory in this election was due to the encouragement of MacArthur's policies, and the Social Democratic parties lost the faith of voters due to multiple corruption cases. Thus, most of the votes were attracted to the Democratic Liberal Party. This also shows that the Japanese people's psychology of "loyalty to the emperor and love of the country," and the concept of restoring the old order, have not changed in the slightest, and are increasingly superstitious about conservative forces. In another fact, the Communist Party originally held four seats in parliament, had no voice, and its mass base was weak. All labor and farmer activities were generally in the hands of the left wing of the Socialist Party. As a result of this general election, Socialist Party leader Tetsu Katayama not only lost the election, but even leftists such as Kanji Kato and Masaru Betchaku also lost. It is estimated that the votes of workers and farmers have gone to the Communist Party, so the Communist Party was able to jump from four seats to 35 seats, an increase of about nine times. Another left-wing party, the Labor-Farmer Party, which is on the same front as the Communist Party, also won seven seats this time. The two parties together have 42 seats. In the new parliament, they may form a left-wing united front and become the government's only opposition party. The future direction of the Democratic Party may tend towards the Democratic Liberal Party. The Socialist Party will inevitably be disgusted by both the left and right in a difficult situation in the middle, and will only follow the path of increasing decline. In short, the victory of this Japanese general election belongs to the Democratic Liberal Party and the Communist Party. One side is the victory of the extreme right, and the other side is the victory of the extreme left, and the opposition and irreconcilability between the two will only deepen and develop. The current situation in Japanese politics is like this, and the future trend will be the same.</p>

<p>According to reliable information: The joint office will include four representatives from the Communist Party and three representatives from the Nationalists. It has not yet been determined whether Fu Zuoyi will participate in the joint office, as Fu himself hopes to retire.</p>
<p>A senior person said: Due to the ceasefire in Beiping, the Communist Party's theory of war criminals has also been cancelled. Local officials are not in danger of being arrested. Whether this matter is true is still unknown, but many key figures are eager to leave Beiping and fly to Qingdao. Senior police officers have already resigned and fled. The director of the Central News Agency's Beiping branch has also left and flown to Qingdao.</p>

It is now winter vacation, and students are divided into small groups of four, enthusiastically studying various issues of life and learning. Professors often hold meetings.

<h3>Nanjing City Council Sends Telegram to Mao Zedong, Requesting an Immediate Ceasefire and Sending Personnel for Peace Talks; Suisui Provincial Council Sends Separate Telegrams to Both Sides to Promote Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Nanjing City Council held its tenth provisional meeting at 3:00 PM on the 25th to discuss the peace and reform plan, and to appeal to the government and the Chinese Communist Party to cease fire and make peace.

The original telegram roughly stated: Mr. Mao Zedong of Yan'an and transferred to the gentlemen of the Chinese Communist Party: The civil war has been going on for three years, and the people cannot bear their lives. The whole country is eagerly hoping for peace and cessation of war. President Chiang proposed it earlier and retreated later. Acting President Li followed up by sending a peace representative, implementing all kinds of auspicious measures, and consulting with people from the third party. The government's sincerity in seeking peace has been seen by China and foreign countries alike. You should take into consideration the overall situation and respect public opinion, immediately order a ceasefire, and send personnel to begin peace talks. As for the eight conditions proposed, they are not difficult to negotiate and resolve. Today, the government authorities have the sincerity to seek peace, and the people only seek to preserve the national and people's lives, and have no likes or dislikes. In short, the only thing today is for both sides to immediately cease fire, so as to bring about an atmosphere of peace and open the door to peace. Everything else can be sought in negotiations to achieve a reasonable solution. Mr. Mao and others have advocated fighting for the liberation of the people. Today, the people of the whole country are eager to seek peace. If they can win the realization of their propositions by not fighting for the people, wouldn't that be benevolence? Wouldn't it be benevolence and wisdom to win the realization of their propositions by not fighting for the people? The merits and demerits of a thousand years, and the misfortunes and blessings of the people, are decided by the thoughts of Mr. Mao and others. We hope that you will carefully consider this matter.</p>

<h3>Acting President Li Reiterates Determination to Strive for Peace; Speech at the Kuomintang Central Commemoration Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Kuomintang Central Headquarters held an expanded commemoration week on the morning of the 24th. Chairman Yu Youren and Acting President Li attended and gave speeches. First, he said that the compatriots of the whole country are currently in a state of extreme suffering, and as a soldier serving the government, he has failed to fulfill his due responsibilities and is deeply ashamed. He then recounted the arduous struggle of the Chinese Kuomintang for national independence and people's freedom over the past decades, and analyzed the reasons for today's failure. Acting President Li said in a firm tone, "Our revolutionary goal is to strive for peace. After the victory of the War of Resistance, everyone thought that they could enjoy peace from then on and rebuild the dilapidated homes. Unfortunately, the war broke out again. Wherever the flames of war passed, the people were trapped in hunger and cold, in deep water and scorching fire. This kind of suffering is no less than what was suffered during the eight years of the War of Resistance. Now the people of the whole country unanimously hope to stop the armed struggle and call for peace. The purpose of the revolution is to maintain and promote the interests of the country and the people. The propositions and actions of the revolutionary party should also be based on the will of the people. Therefore, the government has now decided to use the highest sincerity and the greatest effort to promote the realization of peace. This kind of painstaking effort should be understood by all comrades of our party and compatriots of the whole country." Then, Acting President Li repeatedly expounded the reason why force cannot be relied on, and cited examples from ancient and modern China and foreign countries. In history, far away like Qin Shi Huang and Napoleon, and recently like the warlord forces occupying various parts of China before the Northern Expedition, and Germany and Japan before World War II, all failed because they were superstitious about force. Therefore, the ancients have the saying that "those who are good at war are subject to severe punishment." This kind of bloody lesson in history can serve as a warning. Finally, he said: "After President Chiang retired, I had no choice but to reluctantly accept the heavy responsibility due to the urging and encouragement of the Director-General and all comrades. I was born into a poor peasant family and am an extremely ordinary person. I feel deeply apprehensive about this heavy burden. In the future, I can only act in good conscience, do my best, and be open and honest with the compatriots of the whole country to overcome the current difficulties and achieve the realization of true peace. I especially hope that all comrades of our party and all seniors will give me guidance at any time, so that we can overcome the difficulties together." Car derailment injured many passengers.</p>

<h3>British Tram Workers Insist on Borrowing Half a Month's Salary; The Social Bureau Decides Not to Consider It; All Tram Lines Start Running from the Factory in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The strike of French tram workers has been resolved, and the British tram company has also caused a dispute due to the issue of borrowing salary. Yesterday morning, trams on all British lines, both tram and trolley bus, did not leave the factory. After persuasion from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, they were dispatched at 1:30 pm, but all tram lines implemented the sale of "low-price tickets," regardless of distance, all at three yuan. They returned to the factory in the evening. Shao Changyuan, the driver of the 69th tram line, fainted and died of shortness of breath yesterday morning when he went to the Jing'an Temple Reprocessing Plant to take over his shift due to the labor strike. Workers pointed out that he died of shortness of breath because he heard that the request to borrow half a month's salary was not granted.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Zhao of the Social Affairs Bureau believes that the workers' strike and slowdown actions are caused by a few people stirring up trouble and are without any reason. In addition to doing his best to persuade, he has asked Mayor Wu for instructions on the workers' request to borrow half a month's salary, and it has been decided not to consider it. Wages will absolutely not be paid during the strike or slowdown period. If the workers still do not return to work, Commander Tang has instructed that the case be transferred to the military authorities for handling.</p>
<p>According to Deputy Director Zhao, "The financial situation of all public utilities in this city is currently not good. This year's employee bonus was issued by the municipal government after trying to negotiate a loan of 36 million yuan from the Central Bank. The employee bonus for public utilities is calculated according to the January index, which is already superior to other industries, but the employees have requested to borrow half a month's salary at the end of the lunar year according to the old practice. The company has no money to pay, and the employees of the French tram company went on strike on the 24th. Commander Tang, Mayor Wu, and Commander Chen were all very angry when they heard the news. After consulting with Deputy Minister Lu of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Industry, they convened representatives of the six major companies on the afternoon of the 24th for five and a half hours of discussion. It was decided that half of January's salary would be paid in advance before the lunar New Year. In addition, seven and a half days' salary will be pre-paid, which will still be negotiated by the municipal government, and the Central Bank will loan it to the companies for distribution. At that time, all the union representatives were satisfied with this. Unexpectedly, after hearing the news, some workers of the British tram company pointed out that the union representatives were bribed 28 tombs yuan by the capitalists and deliberately agreed to reduce the request to borrow half a month's salary to seven and a half days. As a result, the public was indignant and a strike occurred. Shao Changyuan, the driver of the 69th tram line, opposed the strike and wanted to drive the tram out of the factory. He was surrounded and stopped, fainted on the spot, and died after being sent to the hospital for treatment. The workers then requested, in addition to borrowing half a month's salary, and asked for preferential treatment for Shao Changyuan. Now, in addition to the request to borrow half a month's salary not being considered, Shao Changyuan died out of sympathy for the union representatives and should be given preferential treatment."</p>

Before the Communist Party stops military action, the martial law order must continue to be implemented. Chen then told the reporter: Strikes are absolutely prohibited during martial law.

<h3>The Silver, Money, and Trust Industries Telegraphed to Congratulate Acting President Li; Suggesting that the National Bank of China has no need to move to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silver, Money, and Trust Association telegraphed Acting President Li in Nanjing to congratulate him. The original text is as follows: To Acting President Li in Nanjing: Since the civil war, the country has been in turmoil. Your Excellency resolutely assumed the position of Acting President, wanting to start with compassion and kindness, and with the people. I respectfully read "Your Excellency's Proclamation," which states that all past laws and actions that hinder the people's freedom and are inconsistent with democratic principles will be promptly repealed or suspended. This is indeed the first good sign that our country is turning from adversity to prosperity. The national conflict originated from the Ning faction split in 1927, and went through six cruel wars in Jiangxi. A united front was established due to the common resistance against Japan. After the victory, with the people hoping for the success of the Political Consultative Conference and jointly planning construction, the civil war suddenly broke out again, which has lasted for two and a half years. Suspicion has deepened and become more intense, resentment has accumulated and become more fierce, and the psychological distance between the two sides has become farther and farther. Therefore, seeking peace today is by no means something that can be achieved in one step. I respectfully ask Your Excellency to persevere with perseverance, follow with patience, and do everything with sincerity, then even gold and stone can be opened. Comrades in the financial sector should put safety first. In terms of finance, safety should be the first priority. There were rumors that the Central Bank of China in Shanghai would soon be evacuated, and people were quite panic-stricken. The Central Bank is the bank of banks, and the turnover and operation of all our banks and companies depend on the Central Bank. In the unlikely event of evacuation, the financial sector will lose its leadership, and the impact can be imagined. Fortunately, on the 22nd of this month, President Liu Gongyun replied to reporters that the rumor that the Central Bank was moving to Guangzhou was unfounded. The industry was slightly relieved. Now that the government is actively seeking peace, not only is there no need for the Central Bank to move, but the fact that it does not move can be used as an expression of sincerity in seeking peace. Is there anything wrong with my humble opinion? I beg Your Excellency's judgment. Chairman Li Ge of the Shanghai Banking Association, Chairman Shen Rixin of the Silver and Money Commercial Association, Chairman Qi Zhi of the Trust Commercial Association and all members respectfully offer this.</p>

<h3>Busy Military Transportation on Two Railways, Unprecedented Train Chaos, Rumors of Passenger Service Interruption Untrue</h3>
<p>[Taibao News] Due to busy military transport on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways in recent days, tracks are congested, and passenger trains are experiencing extreme difficulties. Furthermore, with the end of the year approaching, the number of travelers returning home has suddenly increased, further disrupting order at stations and on passenger trains. Extra trains often fail to comply with the railway bureau's scheduling and frequently try to run ahead, making it impossible for passenger trains to depart. The most delayed trains have been delayed for over ten hours, and the number of accumulated passengers is increasing. The overcrowding in the train cars has reached an alarming level. There are several incidents daily of passengers climbing on top of trains and falling to their deaths. Veteran workers who have worked at the railway bureau for decades say they have never seen such chaotic conditions. Yesterday, rumors in the city that passenger service on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway had been interrupted or that passenger trains only ran as far as Zhenjiang were unfounded. A reporter inquired with the railway bureau about the situation on the Beijing-Shanghai line at 10:00 PM last night. According to reports, Zhenjiang, Danyang, and Nanjing are all safe and normal, and the railway is unobstructed. Only the military trains are congested, preventing passenger trains from departing on time.</p>
<h3>Chaotic Situation at Beijing Station Worsens</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The overcrowding and chaos on passenger trains on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway have worsened in recent days, becoming even more severe on the 25th. The train schedule has lost all semblance of normalcy. The overnight train from Shanghai to Beijing on the 24th was delayed until the morning of the 25th, arriving in Beijing around 3:00 PM. The express train to Xiaguan Station, which was supposed to arrive in Beijing at 12:30 PM, was also delayed by five hours. Other trains were delayed by several hours as well. On the 25th, only the Qiantang train departed from Beijing in the morning. The station was chaotic, and the luggage of passengers piled up like mountains on the platform. When boarding, people rushed and pushed, and the overcrowding was even worse than during the previous evacuation. It was common for passengers to have tickets but be unable to board. Whenever a train stopped at the station, it was immediately filled with people of all kinds. The front and top of the train were packed with people, and even the driver's cab was occupied by passengers, preventing the driver from performing his duties. According to railway bureau officials on the 25th, the normal operation of all trains will be difficult to restore unless the order of boarding is improved.</p>

As of yesterday, the association had received over 4,000 applications from various factories, with 3,000 having been reviewed. Based on their nature, they are divided into two categories: Category A includes machinery, manufacturing, copper and iron smelting, chemical raw materials, casting, and over ten other industries. Category B includes small industries such as household chemicals and handmade dyeing and weaving. Category A has a term of 90 days with a monthly interest rate of 1.5%, while Category B has a term of 60 days with a monthly interest rate of 2.4%. Most applicants are expected to be approved, with amounts ranging from 20,000 to 100,000 yuan. Only a small number of applicants who have not legally registered with the industrial and commercial social departments or whose number of workers is unknown have not been approved. Those who have only joined commercial guilds are also not eligible for industrial loans. If a factory has joined two guilds due to the similarity of its nature and has applied repeatedly, it will be classified according to its nature and one application will be removed. Factories that have been approved for industrial loans will receive a notification letter from the association within days and are expected to receive their loans in full within the Lunar New Year for working capital. The banks designated to provide these loans currently include the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, Central Trust of China, Postal Savings Bank, Cooperative Bank, and the Municipal Bank, totaling seven.</p>

<h3>Suspects Arrested in Murder Case of Quartermaster at Third Supply Station of the Logistics Headquarters Two Years Ago</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the autumn of 1946, Pan Muhua (23 years old, from Fujian, in charge of catering matters), a lieutenant quartermaster at the Third Supply Station of the Logistics Headquarters at 1062 Kunming Road, discovered that Qiu Hengxin (24 years old, from Fujian), a sergeant quartermaster, was suspected of corruption.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate Trading: The National Bank Does Not Wish to Cancel Restrictions, But Can Be Responsible for Maintaining a Certain Price</h3>
<p>Regarding the import and export industries' request to cancel Central Bank Order No. 170, Central Bank authorities stated that the purpose of restricting the trading of transfer certificates is to prevent those not engaged in import and export businesses from intermingling and manipulating transfer certificate prices, hence the restriction. This type of restriction must exist in principle. However, to maintain a certain price for transfer certificates to assist free exports, the Central Bank must naturally take responsibility for regulating and restricting foreign exchange transfer certificates.</p>
<h3>Although Money Market Trends Are Relaxing, Cash Is Still Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the city's money market continued to ease, with abundant funds in the market and sluggish demand, resulting in frequent turnover. The underground interest rate in the market ranged from 40 to 50 yuan per diem, with 35 yuan near noon, and some funds were even offered. However, cash settlement was done at 50 yuan. Industry firms have been continuously supplying short-term funds in recent days, and it is said that recent weekly deposits have been very popular.</p>
<p>According to financial circles, remittances from other cities to Shanghai have amounted to about 1 billion yuan in the past week. Industrial loans issued amounted to 300 million yuan, and treasury disbursements amounted to about 600 million yuan. Therefore, the money market in this city is unusually relaxed.</p>
<p>Although the Central Bank has started issuing a new type of 100-yuan note since yesterday, the shortage of cash in the market has not completely subsided, and banker's drafts are still popular, with a discount of about 4%. Furthermore, it is understood that there are many reasons for the lack of cash, the most obvious of which is the Lunar New Year, when returning travelers must carry considerable amounts of money. In addition, the number of people sending money to support families in other cities and posting insured mail at post offices (each letter can be attached with 500 yuan) has been quite crowded in recent weeks.</p>
<h3>The 23rd Discount and Loan Meeting Passed 25 Loan Cases</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The National Bank's Discount and Loan Committee held its 23rd member meeting at 4 p.m. on the 24th, chaired by Liu Gongyun. The meeting discussed 27 cases reviewed by the Industrial, Mining, Trade, and Agricultural Advisory Committees last week, and two temporary proposals. Excluding three cases that were declined or postponed, a total of 23 loan cases for transportation, public utilities, and industrial and mining enterprises were approved. In the agricultural field, two loan plans submitted by the China Farmers Bank for Qingdao refugee resettlement and grain storage collateral loans were approved. In addition, in order to assist export businesses in obtaining foreign exchange, the committee approved that export businesses in need of working capital could be assisted by means of foreign exchange swaps. Because this method is suitable for manufacturers in port cities, it cannot fully provide foreign letters of credit to exporters in the interior, and it is difficult to handle. It was further stipulated that exporters in the interior who are unable to handle foreign exchange swaps may be assisted on the condition that the bank guarantees foreign exchange settlement (except in cases of force majeure).</p>
<h3>Quiet Tea Market</h3>
<p>Tea merchants have little intention to trade, resulting in a dormant state of trading. Only a few occasional deals are done, mainly to settle accounts, and the trend is calm and uneventful. It is understood that merchants have adjusted their financial positions, and are now waiting to pass the end of the year and then wait for the opening of the new year's trading.</p>
<h3>Continued Softness in the Silk Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market continued to be weak, with a strong atmosphere of peace talks. Merchants were heavily short covering, and the market was unable to recover.</p>
<p>The No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 75,000 yuan, and rumors of rising gold prices slightly boosted confidence. Buying intentions were active in the market, and bids rose to 78,000 yuan. However, due to the approaching end of the year, the market will soon be closed, and those holding goods faced a great risk of interest. Retail investors still mostly closed positions, and the price of muslin fell at the end. Gold prices also fell slightly, and all parties lost interest, and the market generally entered a weak state, with bids gradually falling to 72,500 yuan at closing. The atmosphere in the afternoon was dull, gold prices continued to fall, selling pressure remained strong, and buyers were still cautious. Tianqiao sold at 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw silk: Due to the small increase in the foreign exchange transfer rate, merchants frequently covered their shorts, and the intention to sell increased. Neither export nor domestic sales moved. As the end of the year approached, large firms remained on the sidelines. Trading turned to scattered transactions. The premium grade opened at 85,000 yuan, and the market slightly improved after the improvement of the gold price, and the merchants holding goods wanted to stabilize the market, and the market slightly improved. Later, it was heard that various goods had fallen again, and the foreign exchange transfer certificate continued to soften. No one was interested in the market, and the bulls closed their positions again, and the price softened again. The front market closed at 83,000 yuan at noon, and the confidence in the back market continued to weaken, and the gold notes continued to fall, and the premium grade was sold at 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The silk market has been relatively stable for days, but yesterday the selling trend turned stronger, and the market continued to decline. Initially, the opening of gold notes and muslin was still strong, and confidence was initially fluctuating. The Mei Ya was called at 50,000 yuan. Later, off-market prices fell all the way, and the atmosphere of peace talks enveloped the market. Confidence was low, and the market was unanimously bearish, and retail investors closed their positions one after another, and the market softened again. After softening, buying re-emerged, and the market rose again, reaching 51,500 yuan. Finally, the money market tightened slightly, and the gold notes returned again, and confidence turned weak, and finally closed at 50,000 yuan. The front market fell slightly, and the back market was called at 48,000 yuan, and it was weak again.</p>
<h3>Buyers and Sellers On the Sidelines, Cotton Yarn Weak and Hovering, Many Traders Selling, Cloth Market Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to weaken, and the industry's money supply remained loose. However, due to the Lunar New Year, both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and trading in the market was quiet. Various yarns opened low, and once showed a rally midway. At the close, traders sold a lot, and the trend finally softened.</p>
<p>42s Blue Phoenix fell from 76,000 yuan to close at 73,000 yuan, a final drop of 4,000 yuan. 40s were mostly stable, and 32s Silver Moon opened at 61,000 yuan from the previous day's original price, and finally retreated to within 60,000 yuan, at 59,000 yuan, down 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21s Double Horse spot price rose from 50,000 yuan to a maximum of 53,000 yuan, and the closing price at noon was 48,500 yuan, a drop of 3,500 yuan compared to the previous day. Factory orders were down slightly by 1,000 yuan, and one-day arbitrage was 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>20s Double Horse fell slightly by 1,000 yuan, ending at 43,000 yuan, and the remaining yarns were hovering in a weak range.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth sales were mediocre, and many traders were still selling off their goods. The reason was that off-market prices of various items were sluggish, and manufacturers needed funds to pass the end of the year. Therefore, although the money supply was loose, the general sentiment was still weak.</p>
<p>The off-market price of Longtou fine cloth was 2,350 yuan. Laba Tong fine cloth fell all the way from 2,030 yuan to close at 1,980 yuan, down 90 yuan. B Longtou fine cloth opened high at 2,100 yuan and once fell to 2,000 yuan, with the noon closing at 2,050 yuan, up 20 yuan alone. In addition, Qingdao fine cloths uniformly declined.</p>
<p>Sijunzi Yuan Biji rose from 1,950 yuan to 2,190 yuan, and finally fell back to 2,090 yuan, a final drop of 120 yuan. Medium-grade Biji such as Jinlian Miaowu and Leifengta fell by 100 yuan to 150 yuan, and Sijunzi Yuan Zhigong fell slightly by 30 yuan, closing at 2,420 yuan.</p>
<p>Zhongfang sold 9,870 pieces of cloth yesterday, and another 9,200 pounds of cloth, totaling 21,193,100 gold yuan. Sijunzi Biji 1,080 yuan, Sijunzi bleached cloth 2,250 yuan, Sijunzi printed Biji 2,000 yuan, second-grade printed factory yarn 1,550 yuan, second-grade printed cloth 1,400 yuan, Hongguang Biyuan yarn buying price 1,950 yuan, Tiao Yuan Guangpin 1,380 yuan, Mei Hu Gray Guangxie 1,250 yuan, Sanmeitu 1,107, 1,110, 1,113 flower bleached cloth 1,800 yuan, Laba Tong 12-pound fine cloth 1,900 yuan, Special B 12-pound fine cloth 1,700 yuan, Deputy brand Biji blank 1,450 yuan.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Close Down in Order</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th), the miscellaneous grains, soybean cake, and foreign paper markets began to close. Rice, sugar, dried seafood, and northern and southern goods markets will close from the 26th. All other markets will close from the 27th. All will start trading on February 2nd.</p>
<p>Sugar Rises</p>
<p>The sugar market will close today. Yesterday was the last session, and most of the industry's money was settled. Underground interest rates fell in the market, and those with ample funds mostly made up for their positions. Buying was still strong in the market, and prices rose all the way.</p>
<p>No. 45 White Refined closed at 4,400 yuan, up 450 yuan. Coarse sand, Xing Bai, Chi Hai, Chi Mian, He Chi, Diao Qing, the native factory, and ice, etc., all rose by about 20%.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Meandering and Soft</h3>
<p>Tung oil trading has lacked luster recently because both buyers and sellers are hesitant due to the imminent Lunar New Year. Its trend is softer than before. In view of the fact that off-market prices of various items have mostly declined, confidence is also difficult to boost, and it has turned weak. Until the close, Sufficient White Oil and Zhengpai Xihong, with prices set by the guild, were uniformly down by 100 yuan, to 3,900 yuan. Other items such as Deputy Brand Xihong and Qingyou followed the market and fell back.</p>
<p>Lumber Sluggish</p>
<p>In recent days, fir wood has risen due to rising prices in Fuzhou. Yangsong Liuan had been weak for a long time due to poor actual sales. In recent days, buyers have slightly absorbed it when prices were low.</p>
<h3>Confidence Weak and Sales Stagnant: Rice Continues to Decline, Wheat Flour, Oil, and Soybean Cake All Reported Losses</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last trading day of the rice market before the Lunar New Year. Prices declined because the environment caused confidence to be weak, rice shop sales were stagnant, and dealers' interest was low. Township vendors settled and sold, resulting in abundant supply, and prices fell. The opening price in the morning was intended to be raised due to the high price reported in Wuxi on the previous day, but there was no outlet. The opening price was similar to the previous day, but the price fell by 50 to 100 yuan due to the high supply and low demand. The North City market was said to have fallen by 120 yuan in the early morning, Bo Dao fell by 100 yuan, Bai Geng fell by 80 yuan, and the best early rice had fallen below 1,500 yuan. The South City market generally fell by 50 to 60 yuan. Yesterday's arrivals decreased, totaling 4,302 stones.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour: Prices declined because they had risen on the previous day when all grains had fallen. Those seeking to sell at high prices emerged. Yesterday, the North Gang did not move, and outlets became stagnant. Various brands of flour uniformly fell back to within 700 yuan. Lao Che flour closed at 695 yuan, down 40 yuan. Bingshun also fell back to between 100 yuan, closing at 670 yuan. Other flours uniformly fell by more than 40 yuan. Bran 470 yuan, a sharp drop of 50 yuan. Yesterday was the last market day for flour before the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: The miscellaneous grains market has been closed since yesterday, but some traders still came to the market, about one-tenth of the usual number. There were a few off-market trades. Pinghu beans were 1,000 yuan, Shaoxing corn 550 yuan, and the market was stable.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Prices rose at the close yesterday morning. Jitung raw oil was 7,200 yuan, up 700 yuan. Soybean oil rose back to 6,700 yuan, and rapeseed oil was 5,550 yuan, up slightly by 300 yuan. There were no other transactions.</p>
