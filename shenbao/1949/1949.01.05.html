<h3 id="c1">國民黨中執監委談話會　討論總統和平文告　由張羣張治中說明經過 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕總統文吿發表後，各方反應甚多，茲者，國民黨在京中央執·監委於四日下午四時舉行談話會，對總統文吿所呼籲和平之主旨，予以討論，各抒意見，以提出達到和平目的之谷種途徑。該會由馬超俊主席，出席在京中執·監委數十人，首由張羣·張治中分別報吿此次總統文吿發表前後，各方和平空氣之來源及其經過，並說明自東北戰事開始以來以迄於今，政府中對和戰態度之分野及其發展。兩氏報吿畢，卽由黃少谷，徐永昌分別報吿總統文吿發表後，在政治及軍事兩方之反應情形。繼卽由張道藩·谷正綱·陳逸雲·宋述樵·邵華·劉文島，任卓宣·曹俊等多人分別發言，有人認為文吿中總統所表示之進退問題不能同意，關於此點，會中討論至為激烈，張道藩·谷正綱曾聲嘶力竭，參加辯論，惟並未獲得結論，向被目為和平老人之邵力子氏，四日亦與會，惟未發言，並在其座次打瞌睡，會議至六時許始散。會中所有意見，則交黃少谷·張道藩·谷正綱·鍾天心等整理後，提中常會討論，俟獲有結論，再呈總裁核示。又四日會議絕對保持秘密，與會者相約不得發表談話，故外間所知甚少。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕國民黨中政會四日晨開會，孫科主席，曾對和平問題提出報吿。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京四日電〕截至目前為止，關於總統元旦文吿呼籲和平一點，共產黨方面尙無反響。此間多數觀察家僉信，共黨如果長此緘默，對於大局甚為重要·共方答復或將要求國軍放下武器，停止戰爭，謠傳其在京·滬兩地已派駐代表，但等待反響者則認此係一相情願之辭。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京四日電〕官方等待共產黨對蔣總統之和平文吿的反響，四日已進入第四天，但共黨則仍保持「預徵性」的緘默。</p>
<p>蔣總統與政府官員間之進一步會議，三日及四日均未舉行，渠等或將保留進一步之行動，以靜待共黨態度的澄淸。同時，官方人士及非官方人士間，均在傳布一種感覺，卽共產黨大致將拒絕將總統的建議。若干人曾預測三日晚的共產黨廣播中，或將包括毛澤東之官方答覆，但事實上廣播中僅重申新華社之社論，强調作戰到底，直至國民黨放下武器為止的決心。據未經官方證實之消息，政府正邀請現在北平之前民主同盟領袖張東蓀·張申府·梁秋水及在重慶之梁漱溟等，來京參加和平討論。</p>
<p>〔本報北平四日電〕昨此間某報載京電，傳張東蓀日內將應邀離平飛京，斡旋和平。此間各報記者昨紛出動訪張，皆未得見，據其公子張宗柄稱，其父並未應邀，最近亦無南飛意。</p>
<h3 id="c2">邀請四國調解說　須待共方反響如何而定　司使謂總統文告為重開和談先聲 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京四日電〕據接近官方聲稱：中國政府擬邀請美，英，法，蘇四國從中調解，俾與共黨恢復和談，但此舉須在共方反饗不利或顯然拒絕蔣總統元旦文吿之和平呼籲以後行之。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京四日電〕政府方面之「和平將軍」張治中及「和平老人」部力子稱，外國調解為必須，而當予歡迎者。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕張治中將軍三日晚假介壽堂宴請首都文化新聞界，張氏於席間致詞中，極力避免談及有關當前大局之政治性問題。邵力子氏被請發言，强調和平非不可能之事，渠並希望和平能獲成功。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕總統元旦文吿發表後，美大使司徒雷登，曾於與記者個別談話時表示，渠對總統此次文吿之觀感至為良好，渠以堅決自信之口吻語記者稱：「余絕不欲公開發表任何談話，惟余相信，總統之文吿，無疑將為重開和平談判之先聲，並信日內共黨方面必有相當之反響」。司使一再鄭重表示，與記者之談話，僅係私人性質者，繼稱，「中國人民久經戰爭，亟待休養生息，目前最主要者，殆為經濟復興」。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓二日電〕國務院新聞聯絡官麥克德謨評論中國間題時，對於報紙所稱中國內閣閣員一人曾請南京美大使館出面調解中國之內戰一節，加以否認。麥克德謨稱：「南京方面並未提出正式請求，而余亦不知有何非正式之請求」。</p>
<h3 id="c3">決定性之和平 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>可能尙須經過戰役</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平四日電〕據華北一般人意見，蔣總統元旦文吿，已將國共間全部問題置於政治基礎上，而非軍事基礎上，但或尙須經過數次戰役，亦有可能。決定性之和平，雖非幾個月後不能獲得，惟華北人民已看到戰事結束有期，因而大為欣慰。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京四日電〕消息靈通人士稱：國單飛機在中共陣地上空散發傳單，要求共方停止戰爭，實行和談，此舉係國軍和平攻勢之一部份。</p>
<h3 id="c4">青美陸戰隊　撤退說不確 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕美駐西大平洋海軍司令白吉爾四日晚自靑島來電稱否認駐華美軍撤退之說據此種謠言係因美海軍租賃山東大學校舍契約滿期而起。先是美海軍當局曾與中國敎育部磋商交還該大學校舍，俾供敎育用途，茲悉由此發生撤退誤傳，白氏已訓令中止談判。</p>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕此間美國官方今日稱：靑島美海軍陸戰隊撤退說不確，想係美軍所僱用之普通工作人員撤退之誤，美軍亦無意交還青島山東大學內營房。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕國務院今夜對於靑島美海軍陸戰隊三千名撤退說，表示驚異，惟西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾有權出此，故此事亦非完全不可能。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島四日電〕美海軍陸戰隊二百五十人調往關島，昨晨離靑。</p>
<h3 id="c5">美軍事顧問團　陸續自華撤退 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>

<p>〔聯合社廣州四日電〕美國海軍顧問團駐穗人員已於今日下午整束行裝，其司令洛克伍特已乘海軍飛機赴滬。此事早經預料，並不影饗其駐滬機關之地位。</p>
<h3 id="c6">中美正式承認韓國　兩國駐韓代表團將怍為大使館　李承晚總統特表示謝意 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>

<p>〔中央社漢城四日電〕李承晚總統今宣稱：中國之承認大韓民國政府，全係基於友愛精神與四千年來互衛之一貫傳統，彼並深望藉兩國間長久維持信義，實亦卽遠東和平之屛障，因而兩國定必互蒙其利。又韓國外交部長高昌一，於經由韓駐華外交代表鄭桓範致吳外長鐵城之謝電中謂：謹代表韓國人民對中國政府之所採行動深致謝忱。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓一日電〕白宮一日宣佈：美國承認朝鮮共和國政府。預料美國駐韓特別代表團，在朝鮮政府同意之下，不久將升格為大使館。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢城三日合衆電〕李承晚總統頃謂：美國之承認大韓民國已使懷疑朝鮮人民是否具有自治能力，為一獨立自主民族之陰影，消欽無餘，吾人甚感欣慰，且深表感激。</p>

<p>〔合眾社記者季昂北平四日電〕對於北平而言，共產黨已犯了心理上一個大失策。他們不明白傅作義將軍受人民擁戴的程度，而對他展開人身攻擊，並且把他名列「戰犯」名單，以致引起一般的反感和疑忌。這失策的最新例子。記者得自一名「叫化」之口——但用僕役的口吻，可以這樣說：「他不是普通的叫化」。記者請這位長身玉立中年長袍的「叫化」入內，淸茶一杯，談談往事。他原來是鄕下啓蒙敎員，三天前才來北平。他吿訴我，三星期前共產黨光臨他的鄕村，共軍紀律行為還好，政工人負就來找我，說他可以繼續執敎，因為過去他常常批評共產黨，這倒有些受寵若驚。政工人員幾次三番到他的學校裏鼓吹共產黨好，國民黨不好，然而一天，他們在操塲牆上貼出「打倒傅作義就有和平」的標語（記者看到過這標語），高潮發生了，因為村裘人都崇拜傅宜生將軍，而他部下一支防軍駐在村裏時紀律很好，所以村人的反響很不好。好多人找敎師談話，對這一點表示驚駭。第二天，他被政工人員喊去，說他在家裏舉行「反共反人民」談話。審了幾小時，他被送回家，關照不准走，以後還要問。但乘夜間，他和幾個同村人一同逃進北平了。他說，在共黨攻擊傅作義前，他倒打算過下去，因為共黨不究過往，他倒很想和他們打交道哩！（請參閱第二版「和平在前綫的反映」一文）</p>

<h3 id="c19">社論　讓主人來講話！ <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>新年休假的三天中，國家大局有重大的發展，和平之門，已由總統的元且文告而開啟，自南至北，自東徂西，中國人民仿佛都露了笑容。</p>
<p>然而，同時中國共產黨的廣播電台，依然在痛責政府的和平呼籲，說是「中國反動派和美國侵略者在共同策動和平陰謀」，即英法政府也在「支持美帝國主義此項政策」，因而堅決主張「革命不能在中途放棄」，必須作戰到底。我們老百姓聽了，自不免覺得光明的前途又浮着一層暗影。</p>
<p>上海市參議會代表全上海六百萬市民，首先於二日分電政府和中共雙方，呼籲立即停戰，開始商談；各界自救救國聯合會也繼起主張，並勸雙方代表在滬會談；華北各省市的參議會和國大代表，川鄂兩省參議會，都有同樣迫切的呼籲。我們相信其他各省市的人民，亦必會風起雲湧，喊出要求停戰的呼聲來的。這是和平的略光，也是真正人民講話的開始！</p>
<p>總統文告說：「只望和平果能實現，則個人進退出處絕不縈懷，而一唯國民公意是從」，他的坦白，他的真誠，中外輿論一致認為毫無疑義。今後和戰關鍵，亦即人民為禍為福的關鍵，確如上海市參議會通電所說，實繫於中共諸君一念之間。我們以為今天應該是國家主人向共黨痛切講話的時候了。</p>
<p>八年抗戰而後，中國理應在光天化日的和平空氣下努力建設起來，但是不幸得很，三年以來，整個中國，硝烟炮火，愁雲暗霧，依然籠罩在低氣壓下！我們老百姓大難臨頭，人人恐懼毀滅，人人要求生存，在此迫切時候，怎能不大聲呼號，發出宏亮的心底共鳴？老百姓是國家的主人，政府是為老百姓服務，使老百姓享福的。故不論民選執政也罷，或用他種方法獲得政權也罷，必須從工作上拿出盡善盡美的辦法來，確實符合老百姓的需要，實現眼前福利，如此方能得到全民的擁護。任何政黨，如只以空洞的宣傳高調，欺騙人民，實施上却以武力為奪取政權的工具，勞師動衆，殺人盈野，給人民以無窮苦難，那是我們所絕端反對的。</p>
<p>老實說，中國共產黨號稱「解放」人民，用意則在奪取政權。但無論「解放」也好，奪取也好，總也不能不承認人民是國家的主人。那麼在兵連禍結之下，冰天雪地之時，以「人海」為戰術，以百姓為芻狗，這樣殘忍的屠殺，當不為主人所願見。試看：血海屍山，赤地焦土！誰無父母？誰無子女？生離死別，啼饑號寒，傷心慘目，誠不忍言！我們相信中共諸君固具良知，愛好和平，誰不如我？總統既已竭誠倡導和平，中共又何必作戰到底以重苦中國的老百姓呢？</p>
<p>孟子說：「天作孽，猶可違；自作孽，不可活！」我們試問：現在和平之門已啟，主人爲什麽還要袖手旁觀，讓那少數人孤行己意，來毀滅我們的國家？</p>
<p>以前政治協商的功敗垂成，就是由於國家的真正主人沒有參與，沒有講話，沒有公斷，更沒有用出制止用兵的實力。目前果欲實現和平，雙方應尊重主人的講話，只有主人可以決定一切，可以公斷是非。</p>
<p>大西洋憲章，是近世最重要的文獻，也是人類光榮之所寄託。它是許多國家的偉大政治領袖所宣佈的，也是億萬斯年後世人類所應繼續遵守的。大西洋憲章明明白白昭示我們：無論何人均有權決定他們自己的生活方式以及他們政府所應採取的適合政體。總統的文告指出，和議只要無害於國家的獨立完整，有助於人民的休養生息，憲法不違反，軍隊有保障，人民能維持其自由的生活方式與目前最低生活水準，則個人更無他求。我們以為這確已打開了和平之門。如中共亦有誠意，雙方應各立刻下令切實停戰，並由人民代表和國際公正人士實地　證：同時在中華民國領土以內，從速擇定最適宜的一處，（例如上海），由政府與中共雙方派遣負責商談的代表，在全國人民代表與國際人士公正觀察之下，至誠相見，妥議一個解決一切糾紛的辦法，一切以人民的意志為意志，其爭執不決的各點，最後取決於人民代表的公斷，從此永息兵戎，從事於生產建設，使老百姓都能安居樂業。如再不然，我們還可以訴請世界和平的機構－聯合國－仲裁糾紛，這也是合理的和平解決辦法。</p>
<p>我們想：印度與巴基斯坦可以息爭，猶太與阿拉伯可以停戰，我們中國人民爲什麽不能制止國內的戰爭？只有中國人民綫能挽救多難的中國！我們的命運必須要自己決定，自己挽救！我們要主戰的政黨速速放棄武力！同時，我們要改造，要革新！舊的，不合理的，我們需要制裁改革：新的，合理的，我們願意接受體騐。極權的專制的奴隸生活，我們要拒絕；民主的自由的現代生活，我們要珍貴。誰還不肯給人民以和平的，就是人民的公敵！</p>

<p>〔合衆社記者季昂北平四日電〕國共雙方的下級士兵，對和平的關懷，似乎並不亞於高級官員。記者四日冒寒出北平城關，赴前綫與國軍問談，並進入共軍區域，與共軍撩天。</p>
<p>記者在寒風凜冽中，與一年青之國軍士兵談話，渠手指雪凍的田野的彼岸的共軍防綫稱：「共黨說他們希望和平，蔣總統則宣示政府希望和平，如雙方均有誠意，他們應該迅即達成協議，因為再拖一年，中國老百姓就完了。」他接着稱：「但是共黨是否真有誠意呢？據農夫告訴我們，共軍在村邊牆頭上張貼的標語中寫着：「打倒傳作義，然後才有和平。」但任何人都知道傅將軍是好人，也是好將領，傅將軍已在老百姓中獲得比一切國軍領袖更大的希望，如果共黨要在打倒這樣一個好人後談和平，他們的誠意又怎樣呢？記者逾過雪凍的田野，進入共軍防綫，首先遇到的是兩位蹲在路邊晒太陽的共軍，皮軍帽上的耳套套住雙耳，輕機槍架在膝邊，他們看我走近，並未站起，只喝問「往那裏去？」記者告以「我是外國新聞記者，特地出來找各位撩天的。」他們即將記者帶往路邊的農家，在那裏，七位共軍正在圍着龜火取煖。</p>
<p>其中有一人即問記者：「和平來了嗎？」</p>
<p>他們請記者在板凳上坐下，記者即詢以他們所聽到的和平消息如何，他們說，不過是聽到南京在討論這個問題而已。</p>
<p>記者問：「和平可能嗎？」</p>
<p>幾個人回答：「我們不曉得。」共中有一人稱：「我很希望和平，因為我已作戰七年，我很想回家。」</p>
<p>另一人問我北平是否有電影院。他說，他希望和平能立即到來，因為他希望能看一看電影，直到現在，他還僅僅聽到電影這兩個字而已。</p>
<p>其他一位較老的共軍，可能是軍官，問記者美國對成立包括共產黨的聯合政府的態度，記者答以不知，並詢以蘇聯對中國成立聯合政府的態度，一位共軍憤怒地答稱：「中國政府是中國的事情，而不是蘇聯的」。</p>
<p>當記者辭出時，他們舉禮為別。當記者返抵國軍防綫而走向城關時，一位國軍官員對記者報以微笑。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕蔣總統一日上午十一時主持三十八年元旦團拜典禮後，曾致簡短訓詞，略謂：回想過去三十七年的革命歷史，總理在世時，領導我們黨員作四十年艱苦奮鬥的精神，吾人覺得非常慚愧，同時更覺得非常感奮，今天我發表了一篇元旦文告，說明目前革命大業遭受一時的頓挫，為減輕人民的痛苦，倡導和平的意義，申明和平建國是政府始終一貫的政策，並列舉三年來政府為蔪求和平與共黨委曲求全的事實，要使大家知道本人今天提出和平主張，並非是政府沒有繼續作戰的力量，正因為我們還有很大的戰鬥實力，所以綫能倡導和平，否則無無戰鬥實力，何能再言和平。常言道，不能戰就不能和，亦就是說能戰綫能和，這就是我今天倡導和平的原因。要知道政府今天在軍事政治經濟無論那一方面的力量，都要超過共黨幾倍乃至幾十倍，自從東北作戰以來，陸軍方面雖然遭遇了許多挫折，但是在數量上和質量上，迄今仍居優勢，尤其是空軍和海軍更非共黨戰力所能較量，此外就政治和經濟的基礎來說，亦非共黨所能比擬，現在所遺憾的，是我們政府裏面一部份人員受了共黨惡宣傳，因之心理動搖，幾乎失了信心，因為他們在精神上受了共黨的威脅，所以只看見敵人的力量，而就看不見自己還有比敵人超過幾十倍的大力量存在，大家都知道我們國民革命在廣東最初東征的時候，不過兩個團的兵力，而終於統一全國，後來更能獲得抗戰最後的勝利，我們政府今天有如此堅固的基礎和雄厚的力量，如能恢復當年革命精神，那還有什麽能匪亂不能剿平，因之我們今天倡導和平，並非避戰求和，乃是可戰可和，任由共黨選擇，如共黨真有和平的誠意，政府自願貫澈政治解決的和平政策，以減輕人民的痛苦，保存國家的元氣，這是我今天文告最重要之點，就是「為民請命」，大家必須深切了解的。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕行政院孫院長於元旦晚假中央電台廣播全文如下：「一元復始，萬象更新」，苦難的戰亂的民國卅七年度已經過去，而民國三十八年的元旦已經光臨了，當此新年開始的時候，全國人民當然都人同此心，心同此理的在祈禱和平安定的幸福，總統亦於今天發表文告，宣示致力和平的決心，表示政府希望和平的誠意，我相信這不單是全中國人民的福音，也是全世界友邦人士所最高與聽到的消息。</p>
<p>回憶三年前，當抗戰勝利的初期，由於人民需要休養生息，由於國家需要積極建設，由於各黨派對國家和人民的需要尚有共同認識，我們曾經集合各方代表和社會賢達於一堂，舉行過政治協商會議，經過三星期的努力，更多謝杜魯門總統的特使馬歇爾先生的善意調協，我們也曾經商定了一個和平建國綱領和解決各種爭端的具體方案，假如當時我們能將各種方案及時實行，試問今日的中國應該是如何的繁榮，今天的中國人民應該是如何的幸福呵！可惜當時各方既未能完全放棄小我的利害，全國人民也未能用最大的努力去促進這個和平運動的成功，遂致戰禍復發，生靈塗炭，三年來不但人民生命財產的損失無可計算，就是國家於八年抗戰後所僅存的一綫生機，也幾乎摧殘殆盡了。</p>
<p>今天我們的元首蔣總統已重新昭告為國家謀取和平的決心了，並且表示祗要和平能夠實現，他個人的進退出處絕不縈懷，而一惟國民的公意，總統這個表示，多麼的光明磊落，這真是國家前途的一個新希望，也是全國人民的一個新生機，我個人為國家謀取和平的努力，向不敢後人，現在又適於此時担當行政院長的重任，自必本愛好和平的素志，以最大的努力求和平的實現，但和平絕非靠少數人的力量所能完成，必須大家共同努力才能達到此共同的目的，所以我希望：</p>
<p>第一</p>
<p>前綫的國軍將士必須以最勇敢最堅強的意志固守崗位，絕不可一聞政府宣布和平的意旨而自亂步驟，最近徐蚌會戰，太原會戰，平津會戰，賴前方將士的忠勇犧牲，已將戰局轉危為安，舉國欽仰，今當政府力謀和平的時候，尤須賴前方將士以最大最後的努力，來做和平成功的保障。</p>
<p>第二</p>
<p>和平為雙方之事，必須雙方均有誠意，有決心來求和平，然後和平才能實現，今日政府切望和平的意旨，已明告天下，至盼全國人民亦深切認識和平為自身生死關頭的大事，羣起而為有組織的努力，使共產黨方面亦因洞悉民意的向背，以國家和人民的利益為重，即日停止軍事行動，在保障國家獨立完整，維護人民自由的前提下，共謀和平統一民主憲政的澈底實現，以解除人民當前水深火熱的痛苦。</p>
<p>親愛的同胞，你們在八年抗戰當中，對國家的貢獻以及為民族所受的犧牲，已達到最高最大的限度，然而在八年抗戰以後，仍須天天忍受征兵徵糧和物價波動的痛苦，即政府同人更覺得痛如切膚，政府現正在考慮於最近期間澈底改革征兵徵糧的辦法，務使廣大農村的人民，得以減除痛苦，對於物價問題，也正在尋求最有效的穩定方法，希望使人民的生活能夠得到比較安定的保障，總之凡可以減輕人民痛苦，增進人民福利的事情，我們政府必當悉心以赴，期使政府與人民在精神和事實方面，能打成一片，合力衝破當前的難關，共同創造光明燦爛繁榮幸福的前途。</p>

<p>「一年之計在於春」，吾人應檢討過去錯誤之所在，以及何以遭遇種種挫折與失敗之原因，力謀改正，尤應領導農村，使廣大之人力·物力·為戰鬥之用。孫氏最後稱：總統元旦發表文告，對內對外宣佈，用兵乃非得已，並表示政府極願恢復和平，倘共黨能覺悟，同時表示願意和平的態度，則和平非不可能之事。京滬方面乃至中外輿論界，對於總統文告，已有深刻印象，簽認政府已打開和平之門，現在就看共黨之態度如何，及其是否能明白政府對於和平之意願，而尋求和平解決之方法。</p>

<p>〔合眾社倫敦三日電〕美英法三國三日請蘇聯說明現仍扣留德戰俘多少，及何以不遵照盟國間正式協議於去年年底午夜前盡行釋放。據宣佈，西方盟國由彼等駐蘇大使館代表分別照會莫斯科之蘇聯外交部，提化此項要求。照會內容將至五日方可公佈。但悉，該照會曾提及業經公佈之消息，謂蘇聯現仍扣留之德人幾達一百萬人之多，此外，尙有多人恐未計及在內。傳蘇聯幷仍在西伯利亞扣留日戰俘數十萬人。按四强曾於一九四七年四廿三日，在莫斯科之外長會議席上，同意於一九四七年十二月卅一日午夜釋放所有德戰俘，蘇聯當時承認扣留八九〇·五三二德人，法國扣留六四一·四八三人，英國扣留四三五·二九五人，美國扣留一六·一〇三人。但戰後大謎之一，卽為在蘇聯失蹤之三百萬德人之下落如何。在簽訂莫斯科協議後，西方盟國除仍拘禁戰犯及其他普通罪犯外，業已釋放一切戰俘。因此，法外部發言人否認蘇聯所稱，謂法國現仍拘禁四十萬德人之說。</p>

<h3 id="c99">動亂天堂 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 林報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州一日訊〕在天堂的杭州，作為戰時景色的點綴而　得最特出的，恐怕要以車站的現象為第一了。車站上，混亂擁擠，大有已經兵荒馬亂的情况，而車站方面，把一切責任推在戰時的身上，以致無票搭車，車廂擠成沙丁魚式，車次無定等等，不一而足。脫班三四十分鐘是視為最平常的，否則讓你等上三四小時，也不算希奇。</p>
<p>自從徐蚌會戰，局勢緊張以來，記者曾在這滬杭綫上來回了好多次，也有很多朋友，常常來去滬杭之間，他們都奇怪着為什麽火東脫班竟成了例行公事。據車站上人說：最大的原因是杭州無空餘的軌道，軍車，疏散車，往往佔據了所有的路軌，無法調配進出的車輛，所以中滬開出的赴杭車，在臨平，筧橋，良山門停靠等候空出軌道再開入城站。這個理由，表面上甚為充分，然而細細想來，也有不甚合理的地方。如果疏散車抵城站，可以停在離過城站的地方，如果軍車抵城站，可與部隊長商量，機動的　活的迅速開出，而况浙省政府已費了九牛二虎之力，為兩路浙贛路設計，赴滬的以艮山門為起點，赴贛的以南星橋為起點，而今如此的作法，對於良山門，南星橋的起點，可說只收到極微的效果。再况軍車不多，疏散車也並不佔據太大的數字。</p>
<p>交通混　亂旅客喫苦</p>
<p>廬山管理局長王作民從南京來，對記者疑問為什麽鐵路交亂？武漢日通會如此混報董事長王亞明從上海搭車來，他一直等到六點多鐘才到城站，記者於去年底卅日由滬來杭，在艮山門等候交車（客車），達一小時卅分之久，那在站上候車去滬的旅客，矗立在風雨之中，衣衫盡濕，包裹箱籠都浸在汚泥水裏，而車站上竟無一人吿訴旅客何時可到車，讓他們在患難還沒有來臨頭的時候，已遭逢到患難的痛苦。</p>
<p>一切困難，總可以人力克復的，兩路應該為千萬旅客而努力。　關於浙贛路，南星橋車站，當然也不能如理想的有秩序，然而我們顧念到他是在　路藍縷艱難困苦中甫經完成的，終於寄予了同情的期望</p>
<p>疏運專車　經常開行</p>
<p>據說浙贛路疏運首都各機關集體回鄕眷屬，從十二月十一日到廿五日共運出二萬六千三百九十八人，最多這一天有一千多人，最少這一天有一百多人·疏運機關有總統府，行政，立法，司法，考試，監察等院，國防，地政，工商，交通，社會，農林，衛生，財政等部，聯勤總部，工兵，步兵，砲兵學校，中央黨部，高等法院，郵政匯業儲金局，電信總局，中央社等，所付票價為照十二月六日以前票價計算，卽為現行票價的六分之一，關於列車的配備，十二月十一日至十二月廿一日由該路備車床五列，經常開行三一一·三一三次疏運眷屬專車，由杭接運自京來回鄕眷屬至衡陽。十二月廿二日起，為免回鄕眷屬在杭換車，為二五五·一〇一次京衡，京株直達專車，由京滬路備車床十列，浙贛路五列，津浦路二列，共十七列。關於換票辦法：由各單位派代表一人，以集體換票為原則，依照京發換票證和所乘車，分別換給二等和三等客票。由此觀之，顯見今天鐵路上的車次無定時，是人為的原因多於自然的原因。</p>
<p>我們誠懇的期望，鐵路上能運用一切智慧能力，迅速恢復秩序，免去旅行者不必要的痛苦。</p>
<p>拍賣行家　源源開辦</p>
<p>在杭州，另一戰事景色的鏡頭，就是拍賣行的林立。勝利以來，杭州一直沒有拍賣行。杭州拍賣行的歷史，可以說是今日始。自從一家拍賣行開出後，便有很多家拍賣行繼之而起。這些拍賣行的成立，其原因當是本地很多人想疏散出去，於是把不必要的東西拍賣掉，有的路過杭州，盤費感到拮据，也有把東西拍賣掉的，還有的是住在這天堂裏的人，他們感到生活的艱難，於是把一些東西拍賣掉。比較起來，從杭州疏散出去的人到底還是少數，在杭州停留或過路的却佔着多數。而最大多數的人們，當莫過於在杭州感到生活的難以維持。這多多少少的原因，這多多少少的東西，都含着一頁頁傷心的史實。　此外，流亡學生走了，來了躑躅在街頭的難民，白天裏，他們操着生硬的語言，沿街求乞，入夜，踡縮在屋簷下，苦度這難挨的寒冬。</p>

<p>〔本報蘭州一日航訊〕寒假在邇，蘭市各級學校都舉行期考，其中有市立蘭園實騐小學三個小女生，魯小珍·耿建華·王淑琴，她們都只有十二·三歲。她們在期考（廿八日）的前夕，相偕出走，她們的父母和學校知道這事後，罵上報吿警察局，分頭追查。卅日在西郊十里店居民謝義存處，得知有三個女學生，手提，包往西走去，警局卽派員搭汽車追趕，直到距市區廿九公里的安寗堡才趕上。問她們為什麽逃走！到那裏去？她們說是因為怕考試不及格，打算到酒泉上學去。驚局人員遂把她們帶回，分別交由家長妥為管敎。這事雖小，却為我們的敎育家提出了一個不小的問題。</p>

<h3 id="c103">浙東的桐油 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者蔣風</p>
<p>〔本報金華一日訊〕桐油為我國四大輸出品之一，在它的黃金時代，曾榮領過中國出口總額的第一位，在國外佔有廣大而穩固的市塲。我國桐油產區分佈至為廣泛，，遍及川，湘，桂，浙，鄂，黔，陜，皖，贛，豫，閩，粤，康，滇，甘，蘇等十六省。浙江桐油產量，在全國各產油省份中占第四位，年產五十萬市担左右。浙江桐油產區多在俗稱浙東的舊金，衢，嚴，處，台，溫等屬各縣。</p>
<p>在抗戰以前，浙省提倡植桐頗為努力，年產量逐年增加。當時</p>
<p>每擔最高價約為二十五元左右，約合米六百市斤左右，因此，農民對於種植桐樹極感興趣，而種植面積也擴展得非常迅速。當時浙省農政當局極注意桐樹的推廣，早在民國二十四年，浙省農林管理委員會成立，卽在衢縣設立十里荒山墾殖辦事處，與江山四郊，嵊縣鹿台山等地，同時墾殖油桐，用作提倡示範，成效頗著。</p>
<p>及至抗戰後期，烽火遍及太平洋，桐油外銷絕望，價格一落千丈，每担桐油僅合米一百五十斤左右。加上戰時糧食缺乏，糧價高漲，農民多剷桐，改種糧食作物，桐油產量大為减色，僅及戰前四分之一左右。</p>
<p>勝利以後，曾經名聞國際市塲之「浙油」，仍少起色。雖然，在復員之初，一般農民認為</p>
<p>桐油的好景卽將重臨，也有重植桐樹的，但是桐油價格一直停滯不起，農民植桐之興趣又復漸趨消沉，「浙油」之前途隨之而日趨黯淡。推究原因，除油價與其他商品比較下落外，尙有原因：（一）戰時曾陷敵手之桐區，遭受砍伐，損失慘重，恢復不易。（二）國內戰亂連年，桐樹生長較他種作物遲緩，農民種植興趣消沉。（三）油桐之病虫害猖獗。（四）桐農製油均用土法，油質不純，外銷不易。（五）桐農油商均感資金不足，無法作大規模生產及運銷。</p>
<p>在不久以前，記者曾經訪問過浙東幾個主要的產桐縣分如蘭谿，淳安，衢縣，江山，建德等地。這些產品，都未能恢復</p>
<p>戰前的舊觀產量亦欲興乏力。農民多以陳舊的生產方法，最劣質的土地，古老的工具，完成油桐的種植及桐油的生產。</p>
<p>浙東一帶，通常在霜降之後，農民開始將桐子挑運往臨近的榨油作坊，以少量的桐子換取桐油或油餅，有時亦直接折價售與作坊或其他小油商。</p>
<p>榨油作坊多規模甚小，應用木榨榨油，木榨的構造極其簡單，產量有限。作坊收進另星小量之桐子，集有成數，卽經過</p>
<p>下列五步驟而成為「毛油」。</p>
<p>（一）淸子：作坊收進之桐子，多夾有灰土及其他雜物常用手工揀選，或利用風力揚簸，除去灰土雜物。</p>
<p>（二）烘子：作坊多以磚塊砌成坑灶，上覆竹簾，烘乾桐子，桐子疊置於竹簾上約五寸許，下以文火烘烤，並須時時翻動，以免桐子烘焦。坑灶之大小與數目，視作坊之大小而定。但每一坑灶，多以一工人照料，火勢大小，翻動次數，烘烤時間，全憑工人之經騐決定之。通常烘烤一天半至二天，烘畢，再經篩理手續，以去其碎焦皮殼。</p>
<p>（三）碾碎：將烘乾之桐子傾入一圓形石糟，每次二担至三担，以牛一條　眼拖上一大石輪碾碎之。若少量桐子，亦有傾石臼以人力春碎。</p>
<p>（四）蒸製；將碾碎之桐子放入蒸鍋上　黨十分鐘，使之柔化而易於黏着成塊。再以鐵圈四只，疊放製餅板上，相連成筒形，筒底筒裏，滿舖紥束之稻草，並露一端於圈外，將蒸製後之桐子粉，傾倒於稻草之上，製餅工人遂立於熱粉上，以足踏壓，並將靈於鐵圈周圍之稻草用足踩入，使之緊包於餅上。</p>
<p>（五）榨油：入榨時，將餅上兩旁之鐵圈取下，然後將餅樹置於榨膛內，每次十枚至十五枚，再以人力持撞槓將水　打入榨腔，橫擠油餅，使之緊壓徐徐出油。</p>
<p>作坊將製榨成的桐油，分頭裝入油簍，運往蘭谿·衢州·溫州等集散轉口地，再由油商運銷滬上。</p>
<p>一般地看，浙東一勢種植之桐樹，多為二年桐，且天然的條件，如氣候。土壤。均適於植桐，所產桐油，色淡質優，只要戡亂平定，外銷暢通，「浙油」仍將獨步於國際市塲，是可以預料的</p>

<p>〔本報貴陽〕日航訊〕黔省當局為發展本省鍍業起見，現正計劃着手探尋地下資源，藉為促進經濟建設，開發賓藏先聲。據黔省地質調查所稱：本省地下資源蘊藏極富，抗戰期間，經先後發現者，有修文縣之鋁鑛，質量之佳，為全國冠。水城觀音山之鐵　，其儲量之多，西南各省無出其右。其他各種有價値之鑛產，則不勝枚舉。惟以限於人力·財力，一時無法開發，殊足令人遺憾。至於該所最近之調查測勘工作，亦以經濟關係，尙未全面展開，年來僅就若干處女地帶從事局部勘測，今後計劃，預計將於今年完成全省地質鐵產之初步有系統之調在工作，而以本省東南區為主要對象。據該所最近所發現者，計在榕江·黎平·錦屛·三都·劍河·從江等六縣境內，有金·鐵·鋅·銻·汞·煤·硝石·陶土·磁黃鐵等鑛，蘊藏甚豐。所佔面積極廣，其中最値得注意者，卽榕江之銻，從江之石棉與磁鐵鑛，尤極珍貴。且該區與廣西接壤之處，其火成岩與變質岩之分佈甚廣，可能含有「原子能」之鑛物。該所頃訂本年分上下兩期，前往詳為勘測，預計於三四月內完成從江·榕江·三都縣境之調查工作，下期在九十月間勘測黎平·劍河等地，全部勘測經費，經已預算為金圓五萬九千二百元，擬在本省建設專款項下撥支，以便早日從事。</p>
<h3 id="c106">喫下去的請吐出來　存兌技術欠周密　甯夏掀起黃金潮　嗎鴻逵規老百姓叫寃 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　平良</p>
<p>〔本報寗夏一日航訊〕寗夏中央銀行辦理黃金存兌，因為交通不便，黃金須自蘭州轉運來寗，所以自十二月九日才開始，較規定開始日期晚了十三天。首批運到的黃金，據該行公佈：，有一百九十餘兩，可是由於手續的不週詳，運到不數日間，存金便全部吿罄，一般老百姓都沒有兌上。於是央行存兌黃金引起輿論界的懷疑，羣情憤怒，大喊不平，掀起了一塲黃金潮。</p>
<p>馬主席鴻逵獲悉後，曾發表過一次沉痛的談話，他說：「自從發行金圓券以來，不少愛國之士，拿出黃金白銀兌換金圓券，作熱烈的擁護，無如國運不佳，數日後黑市隨之驟來，物價上漲，社會金融，愈形不安·總統自東北回京，深以人民兌出金銀所受之損失為憾，抱「取之於民，用之於民」之意，准許人民存兌金銀，舉國聞訊，對金圓券之信心因之大增。本省中央銀行此次運到黃金一百九十餘兩，按手續講，應當先在報端公吿，並公佈存兌詳細辦法。按情理講，應當由當初以黃金白銀交換金圓券的人優先存兌。但不料這次黃金一到，他們密而不宣，行裏的人先兌，然後敷衍一下，再由金融界存兌，最後牌子悄悄藏起來，等到老百姓知道了去問，說黃金兌完了。這是什麼話？總統為人民設想之經濟政策，反給了銀行人員分贓的優先權，天下還有比這不平的事嗎？言之令人遺憾！我（馬氏自稱）因見老百姓竟無一人能以存兌，派人去央行打聽，究竟誰兌走了？而銀行說，非總行命令，任何人不能看帳，似此則外人懷疑銀行有弊之說，不為無因」。</p>
<p>馬主席繼續對銀行辦事的顢預，予以抨擊，他說：「國家金融波動如此，人民對金圓券的信心之不堅又如彼，而負穩定金融責任的銀行，反而唯利是圖，實在不成話！同時使人不懂的：地方機關接到中央機關的兌款通知，總是十來八天取不上，一問央行說沒有來，試問地方機關的通知能接到，而央行的通知接不到，原因在那裏？而且每每都是錯後，難道竟無一　次錯前？再者，地方機關兌往京，滬的款，收款機關總是說過十來八天才能取出，這實在令人不明眞象。有人說銀行把兌款給人家遲付，在那裏吃日息，我（馬氏自稱）從前還不大相信，就現在看來，原來一言難盡！」</p>
<p>最後，馬主席感慨萬端的說；「總統為國為民，勞心勞力，而命令一下，執行機關，中間辦事人員，層層折扣，命令完全變質，這不僅是黃金存兌獨有的現象。言念及此，眞不禁為老百姓叫寃！」</p>
<p>接着有關方面向央行查詢的結果，央行拿出的出兌黃金登記單，單上所列的存兌戶名，地址，經查對多無其人，以致一般人認定央行有揑名舞弊的嫌疑。不過失行經理程家鵬對記者另有一種說法，他說：「原奉總行命令，自十一月廿六日開始存兌黃金，但當時黃金未到，暫時辦理登記手續，存兌之戶把款交到後，給一　條，等黃金運到時憑條取金。廿六日將存兌黃金公吿牌掛出，但整日無人問津，本行惟恐總行認為延期朱辦，並為倡導起見，本人（程家鵬自稱）和營業系長馮之梧每人各存兌五錢。至存兌手續方面，總行根本未詳細，訂個標準，究竟何人該兌，或規定何種登記手續。故在開兌時，甚為混亂，任何人來均可存兌。我們為愼重起見，又自行規定一種登記單，令各存兌戶自已塡寫，也沒有取保，但現在事後考查，所登記的姓名，住址，多為揑造，這實在是本行當時無法防制，而且根本沒有考慮到的一點。</p>
<p>事已至此，據程經理表示：「吃下肚的，請吐出來！」本市各銀行同業所存兌的四十六兩黃金，已全部退回，暫存央行。其他各有根底的存戶，如有命令，也可以追回，不過無着落的名單，現在正儘量在查究。</p>
<p>當局為澈底根究出揑名存兌者，到底是何許人，以息衆怒起見，特令派軍法處加緊查究，現在還未到水落石出的階段，不過已有人透露出綫索，不久一定會把這謎底揭曉的。</p>

<p>食米昨開紅盤交易，價格反見略挫，因天氣晴朗，到貨甚旺，產地價格在休市期中略疲，故貨主喊價亦低，初開下降四五十元，中市米店納胃轉暢，價略轉昂，但收市仍較去年降三四十元，南市白粳六百三十元，計降三十元，早稻挫二十五元，陰白元銷路尙活，略低十元。北市塲白粳開六百三十元，降二十五元，早薄稻羊秈各降二十餘元，昨日到貨南北市共計有一萬九千三百八十四石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>猛漲甚力，貨主以在休市期中，三天拆息甚多，咸扳高價格，加之本街店存甚少，上市添補頗多，漲勢遂熾，老車開市三百十五元，直綫升至三百三十七元收市，較去年狂漲六十五元。兵船粉散戶納胃濃厚，收市為三百三十五元，狂升七十二元，紅蜂通成及雜牌粉一致出三百外，大包麩皮漲近四十元。</p>

<p>漲勢猛烈，初開貨主卽以休市三天之利息加上甚鉅，故扳價甚力，後更因本街納胃頗强，漲勢益猛，豆油開市二千六百元，最高至二千九百元，收市為二千八百元，較去年收市漲七百元，達三成餘。生菜油最高二千七百元，收市二千六百元，亦漲七百元。吉桶生油以二千九百元收市。豆餅跟隨上升四十元光景。</p>

<h3 id="c108">去年出口結匯　達一倍七千萬美元 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>據輸管會息，上海一埠，去年全年各月結匯金額如次：一月份九·三九八·〇〇〇美元，二月份八·六八七·〇〇〇美元，三月份九·二三〇·〇〇〇美元，四月份八·〇一八·〇〇〇美元，五月份一二·五九三·〇〇〇美元，六月份一五·〇一一·〇〇〇美元，七月份一四·九三三·〇〇〇美元，八月份一七·二〇五·〇〇〇美元，九月份一七二二四·〇〇〇美元，十月份一四·八九二·〇〇〇美元，十一月份二〇·〇二九·〇〇〇美元，十二月份初步統計為二四·九九〇·〇〇〇美元，合計一七三·二一〇·〇〇〇美元。其中以四月份為最低，十二月份為最高。就全年觀察，六月份起，出口結匯情形，開始好轉。因此時結匯證明書已實行，出口有利之故。惟十月份又見下降，因此時改幣以後，國內出口物資價漲，金元對外匯率遂見偏高，故出口結匯萎縮。至十一·十二兩月，因外匯移轉證之實行，出口大受刺激，其結匯金額均在二千萬美元以上，打破以往之紀錄。一般預料，若今年和平實現，運輸暢通，上海出口情形更可樂觀云。</p>

<p>據市工業會技術委員會發表，本市搪瓷工廠十八家，共有工人二〇九〇一人。開工搪瓷窰三十五座，製粉窰十三座，迥轉窰四座，其中以華豐，益豐規模最大，各有開工搪瓷窰五座，惟華豐設備較新。次為義生廠，有開工窰三座，中華，久新，鑄豐，泰豐，錦隆，金星，新華，順風等廠各有開工窰二座。再次為緯大，民豐，中國廣大，華業，華成，立興，鴻福等廠，各有開工　一座。立興去年成立，鴻福本年初開工，中國廣大廠現正合併九豐廠之設備，將來產量可多一倍。各廠每月產量，如以面忿痰盂，各種盤，鍋，碗，杯等，折合而盆計算，約五十萬至六十萬只。磁牌七萬方尺。每月需用28至3030號鐵皮六二〇噸，智利硝四十五噸，純碱五十五噸，硼砂一百三十噸，石英粉，長石粉，螢石粉，冰晶粉等四百噸，柴油七百三十噸，其中百分之七十以上為進口原料，最近因上海市面購買力薄弱，華北及長江一帶，貨運不暢，南洋各地因外匯率較「八·一九」基價提高不及八倍，而成本已高漲十倍以上，外銷幾不可能，致各廠銷貨大感困難，不得不减低廠盤，最近批發價格為「八·一九」基價之十倍，而工資原料已漲至十五倍以上云。</p>

<p>空校訪滬五戰一負四勝，元旦擊潰華聯一役，戰績尤為輝煌，該隊代力，殊堪驚人。昨賽詳情如次：</p>
<p>東華勝氣象</p>
<p>東華祗五人，另時請傅金聲客串，氣象亦祗五人，堅持到底。氣象柯令斯先中兩罰球，傅金聲籃下投中，對方羅西歐又來一球，陳祥龍戰成四平，韓龍海柯令斯再成六平，東華方出頭一分。俄復落成，東華諸將，跌撲滾翻，兩軍此起彼落，保持均勢，十三比十二，東華領前，洋兵暫停·第一節十四比十三，氣象在前。</p>
<p>第二節柯令斯羅西歡二人不絕進攻，東華不敵，亦呼暫停，上半時廿五比廿，「氣象萬千」。</p>
<p>下半時李垚易出韓龍海，傅金聲活躍，漸見頭緒，李以二罰球，造成廿七平手，幼良命中，超越二分，從此否極泰來，有直上靑雲之勢，第三節四十比卅三，東華歡喜。</p>
<p>末節東華搶球殊凶，氣象小孩子柯令斯，奮不顧身，混戰結果，東華以四八比四五勝三分。</p>

<p>空校勝西青</p>
<p>第二塲空校改戰西靑，以廖學文，朱聲漪，游健行，袁世銑，孫煥庭五將先出塲。西靑接戰之下，卽行投中，不久成四比一，廖學文短兵相接，摸索一球，勢仍不敵，六比五，西靑重行佈置，空校仍未上路，投籃慌張，失之交臂，廖屢擲方中，殊見吃力。對方小黃毛鮑愛可動作敏捷，輕易獲分，空校苦苦撑持，以十一比十超前，聲勢乃盛，爭奪遂起，上半時十五分難兄難弟。</p>
<p>下半時廖先中，却利以二分追出，聲漪替出復明，羣呼空校加汕，煥庭不負衆望，連中二球，局勢改變。世漪學文俱發威，成廿七比廿二，格里朋五次犯規，色勃令基代戰，飛將軍頓以卅五比廿五前導十分。西靑陣脚大觀，攻勢難過，不滿五分鐘，已抵四五比廿七，洋人膛目，不知所措，空校終以五一比卅二大勝。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕冬令賑災足球慈善賽，於三日下午二時半，華聯與西聯兩隊在逸園球塲舉行，觀衆善士在萬人以上，盛極一時。門票收入，門售共計十八萬數千元。吳市長親臨行開球禮，京滬鐵路王副局長兆槐主持拍賣義球，市警察局軍樂隊到塲奏樂助興，上海電合專綫廣播戰况，球塲情緒相當熱烈。角逐結果，西聯以三比二小勝華聯，上半時西聯以一比零佔先。兩隊出塲陣容如下：</p>
<p>西聯</p>
<p>薛的谷夫　許而茲　卡洛列區　格里菲司　鐵伏尼　A奧列維拉　潘萊　勃格尼　格里納司　勞勃司托夫下　蓋比上　　柯拉上　　托士下　　萊上</p>

<p>拍賣議球</p>
<p>休息時間，由王副局長兆槐主持拍賣義球，自金圓券一百元起，經熱烈競爭，結果終由「老球迷」程伯庵以五萬元最高價拍得。程伯庵再皮捐出，重行拍賣，最後由一董姓以無名氏名義出五萬元買得，救濟難民，熟忱可風。</p>
<p>華聨之敗</p>
<p>天寒地凍，此一塲本季精彩慈善賽，實在精彩不多。華聯始終未見默契，尤以右翼林典羲之過弱，失去機會甚多，球每到此卽止。高秀淸矮小，右翼實力大為削弱。左翼則金祿生得球不多，小羅最為傑出，幾次衝刺，煞是厲害。中衛高保正最實力。西聯後衛中衛甚佳，右翼潘萊尤可愛。華聨之失，第一示十二碼，下半時第二球中柱彈入，皆非力所能救，第三球則因中衞太出，後衛反救不及。下半時華聯反攻猛烈，環逼不能中，知大勢去矣。</p>
<p>十二碼球</p>
<p>比賽於二時卅五分開始，栽判員何守衡，巡邊員陳吉群，惠勃。吳市長徐步入塲，與中西兩隊球員分別握手後，卽撥動皮球，揭開大戰。西聯獲得吳市長的配給球，正待進犯，為華聯追蹤趕上，但右翼林典羲過於軟弱，屢屢喪失良機。九分鐘時，西聯前鋒蓋比受傷離塲，適「小黃毛」勞勃司托夫趕到，替補入塲，攻勢驟增。至廿九分鐘時，嚴士鑫阻礙小黃毛進攻，在禁區內闖禍，彼判十二碼，由格里納司主罰中的，上半時西聯遂以一對零佔先。</p>
<p>一球受挫</p>
<p>易地再戰，重行登塲，華聯以陳勤上陣，調出林典羲，西聯山托士進塲調出A奧列維拉。西聯撥球進犯，混戰十分鐘，山托得士勞勃司托夫的傳中，近門力射，中門柱彈入，二對零。華聯反攻，未及一分鐘，瞿永福不負使命，以美妙姿態，扳回一球。但戰至廿五分鐘時，勞勃司托夫盤過吳麒祥，近門力射，徐福生接而復失，滾入洞裏，三比一，西聯又奪一城。至卅一分鐘時，高秀淸得陳勤派司，連人帶球竄進網窠。直至時間告終，西聯以三對二小勝華聯。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Talks by Central Executive and Supervisory Committee Members of the Kuomintang on the President's Peace Message: Explanation of the Process by Zhang Qun and Zhang Zhizhong <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] Following the publication of the President's message, there have been numerous reactions from various quarters. Today, the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members of the Kuomintang in Nanjing held a discussion meeting at 4:00 PM to deliberate on the main theme of peace advocated in the President's message and to express their opinions, aiming to propose various ways to achieve the goal of peace. The meeting was chaired by Ma Chaojun, with dozens of Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members in Nanjing attending. First, Zhang Qun and Zhang Zhizhong reported separately on the sources and process of the atmosphere of peace before and after the publication of the President's message. They also explained the divisions within the government on the attitude towards peace and war since the beginning of the Northeast conflict and its development. After their reports, Huang Shaogu and Xu Yongchang reported separately on the reactions in the political and military spheres after the publication of the President's message. Subsequently, Zhang Daofan, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Yiyun, Song Shuqiao, Shao Hua, Liu Wendao, Ren Zhuoxuan, Cao Jun, and others spoke separately. Some expressed disagreement with the President's expression of the issue of advance and retreat in the message. The discussion on this point was extremely intense, with Zhang Daofan and Gu Zhenggang arguing vehemently. However, no conclusion was reached. Shao Lizi, who has long been regarded as an advocate of peace, also attended the meeting on the 4th but did not speak and was seen dozing off in his seat. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. All opinions expressed at the meeting were handed over to Huang Shaogu, Zhang Daofan, Gu Zhenggang, Zhong Tianxin, and others for compilation before being submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion. Once a conclusion is reached, it will be presented to the Director-General for review. Furthermore, the meeting on the 4th was kept strictly confidential, and attendees agreed not to make any public statements. Therefore, very little is known to the outside world.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The Kuomintang Central Political Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 4th, chaired by Sun Ke, who presented a report on the peace issue.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 4th] As of now, there has been no response from the Communist Party regarding the President's New Year's Day message calling for peace. Most observers here believe that if the Communist Party remains silent for a prolonged period, it will be very significant for the overall situation. It is rumored that the Communist Party's response may demand that the National Army lay down their arms and cease hostilities, and that they have dispatched representatives to Nanjing and Shanghai. However, those awaiting a response believe this is wishful thinking.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing, 4th] The official wait for the Communist Party's response to President Chiang's peace message entered its fourth day on the 4th, but the Communist Party remained "presumptively" silent.</p>
<p>Further meetings between President Chiang and government officials were not held on the 3rd and 4th. They may reserve further action to await clarification of the Communist Party's attitude. At the same time, there is a widespread feeling among official and non-official circles that the Communist Party will likely reject the President's proposals. Some had predicted that the Communist Party broadcast on the evening of the 3rd would include Mao Zedong's official response, but in fact, the broadcast only reiterated the Xinhua News Agency's editorial, emphasizing the determination to fight to the end until the Kuomintang lays down its arms. According to unconfirmed reports, the government is inviting Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Shenfu, Liang Qiushui, former leaders of the Democratic League now in Beiping, and Liang Shuming in Chongqing, to Nanjing to participate in peace discussions.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th] Yesterday, a local newspaper reported that Zhang Dongsun would be invited to leave Beiping for Nanjing soon to mediate peace. Reporters from various newspapers here went out to interview Zhang yesterday, but were unable to see him. According to his son, Zhang Zongbing, his father has not been invited and has no intention of flying south recently.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Possibility of Inviting Four Nations to Mediate Depends on the Communist Party's Response: U.S. Ambassador Says the President's Message is a Prelude to Reopening Peace Talks <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 4th] According to sources close to the government, the Chinese government intends to invite the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to mediate in order to resume peace talks with the Communist Party, but this will only be done after the Communist Party's response is unfavorable or clearly rejects President Chiang's New Year's Day message calling for peace.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing, 4th] Zhang Zhizhong, the government's "Peace General," and Shao Lizi, the "Peace Elder," said that foreign mediation is necessary and should be welcomed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 3rd] General Zhang Zhizhong hosted a banquet for cultural and press circles in the capital at Jieshou Hall on the evening of the 3rd. In his speech at the banquet, Zhang tried his best to avoid discussing political issues related to the current situation. Shao Lizi was invited to speak and emphasized that peace is not impossible, and he hoped that peace would be achieved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 3rd] After the publication of the President's New Year's Day message, U.S. Ambassador Stuart expressed in private conversations with reporters that he had a very good impression of the President's message. He confidently told reporters: "I absolutely do not want to make any public statements, but I believe that the President's message will undoubtedly be a prelude to reopening peace negotiations, and I believe that there will be a corresponding response from the Communist Party within days." The Ambassador repeatedly emphasized that his conversation with reporters was of a private nature and went on to say, "The Chinese people have been through war for a long time and urgently need to rest and recuperate. The most important thing at present is economic recovery."</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 2nd] When commenting on the China issue, State Department Press Officer McDermott denied the newspaper reports that a member of the Chinese cabinet had asked the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing to mediate in the Chinese civil war. McDermott said: "No formal request has been made by Nanjing, and I am not aware of any informal request."</p>
<h3 id="e3">Decisive Peace <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>May Still Require Battles</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 4th] According to general opinion in North China, President Chiang's New Year's Day message has placed all issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on a political rather than a military basis, but it may still require several battles. Decisive peace may not be achieved for several months, but the people of North China are greatly relieved to see that the end of the war is in sight.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 4th] According to well-informed sources, Nationalist aircraft are dropping leaflets over Communist positions, urging the Communist Party to stop the war and implement peace talks. This is part of the National Army's peace offensive.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Qingdao U.S. Marines: Report of Withdrawal Untrue <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Our City] U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Badger telegraphed from Qingdao on the evening of the 4th, denying the report of the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China. According to him, this rumor originated from the expiration of the U.S. Navy's lease of Shandong University's school buildings. Previously, the U.S. Navy authorities had consulted with the Chinese Ministry of Education on returning the university's school buildings for educational purposes. It is now understood that this led to the mistaken report of withdrawal. Badger has ordered the suspension of negotiations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Our City] U.S. officials here stated today that the report of the withdrawal of U.S. Marines from Qingdao is untrue. It is thought to be a misunderstanding of the withdrawal of ordinary workers employed by the U.S. military. The U.S. military has no intention of returning the barracks within Shandong University in Qingdao.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 3rd] The State Department expressed surprise tonight at the report of the withdrawal of 3,000 U.S. Marines from Qingdao, but as Pacific Fleet Commander Badger has the authority to issue such an order, it is not entirely impossible.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Office, 4th] 250 U.S. Marines were transferred to Guam and left Qingdao yesterday morning.</p>
<h3 id="e5">U.S. Military Advisory Group: Gradual Withdrawal from China <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 3rd] The U.S. Military Advisory Group in China is gradually withdrawing from China. From November 13th to December 1st, 1,101 family members have been withdrawn, and officers are also being withdrawn gradually. Currently, there are fewer than 200 officers stationed in Nanjing. As of December 20th, 6,000 tons of equipment have been withdrawn, and 15,000 tons are waiting to be transported.</p>
<p>[United Press Guangzhou, 4th] The personnel of the U.S. Naval Advisory Group stationed in Guangzhou packed their luggage this afternoon, and their commander, Lockwood, flew to Shanghai by naval aircraft. This was expected and does not affect the status of their agency in Shanghai.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 3rd] A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated on the 3rd that the Chinese government has formally recognized the government of the Republic of Korea since January 1st of this year and is preparing to convert our representative delegation in Korea into an embassy in Korea.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Seoul, 4th] Xu Shaochang, our acting diplomatic representative in Korea, informed Korean President Syngman Rhee at 2:30 PM today that the Chinese government has formally recognized the Republic of Korea since January 1st of this year and is preparing to establish an embassy in Korea to replace the former diplomatic representative office. During his meeting with Xu Shaochang and Stuart at his official residence, Syngman Rhee specially thanked the representative for China's action.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Seoul, 4th] President Syngman Rhee declared today that China's recognition of the Republic of Korea is entirely based on the spirit of friendship and the consistent tradition of mutual defense for four thousand years. He also hopes that the long-term maintenance of trust between the two countries will indeed be a barrier to peace in the Far East, and therefore both countries will definitely benefit from it.

<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters reported that the number of bandit troops outside Beiping has increased to seven columns, four of which have been transferred from Xinbao'an, Zhangtan, and other places under Nie Rongzhen and Shao. According to intelligence obtained by the military, the bandits seem to be preparing to attack the city. The highest military authorities in North China have made the necessary deployments.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Office, 4th] The main force of Lin Biao's bandit troops is gathering around Tianjin, with frequent and erratic movements. Yesterday, there was a sense of an impending storm, but today the signs of a major battle have become ambiguous again. The authorities are paying close attention to their next move.

<h3 id="e17">The Communist Party's Saying "Overthrow Fu Zuoyi" Has Aroused Antipathy and Distrust Among the People of North China <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press Reporter Jion, Beiping, 4th] As far as Beiping is concerned, the Communist Party has made a major psychological blunder. They do not understand the extent to which General Fu Zuoyi is supported by the people, and their personal attacks on him and listing him on the "war criminal" list have aroused general antipathy and distrust. The latest example of this blunder: A reporter learned from the mouth of a "beggar" - but in the tone of a servant, it could be said: "He is not an ordinary beggar." The reporter invited this tall, middle-aged man in a long robe "beggar" inside, offered him a cup of tea, and talked about the past. He was originally a village school teacher who had just come to Beiping three days ago. He told me that three weeks ago, the Communist Party visited his village. The Communist troops behaved well, and a political worker took the initiative to find him and said that he could continue teaching because he had often criticized the Communist Party in the past. This was somewhat flattered. The political workers repeatedly came to his school to promote the good of the Communist Party and the bad of the Kuomintang. However, one day, they posted a slogan on the wall of the playground: "Overthrow Fu Zuoyi and there will be peace" (the reporter saw this slogan). The climax came because the villagers all admired General Fu Yisheng, and the garrison under his command had very good discipline when stationed in the village, so the villagers' reaction was very bad. Many people talked to the teacher and expressed shock at this point. The next day, he was called by the political workers, who said that he was holding "anti-communist and anti-people" talks at home. After being interrogated for several hours, he was sent home, told not to leave, and would be questioned later. But at night, he and several villagers escaped into Beiping together. He said that before the Communist Party attacked Fu Zuoyi, he had planned to go on because the Communist Party did not investigate the past, and he wanted to deal with them!

Speakers were enthusiastic, and all agreed that the door to peace talks had been reopened by the government's declaration. The key to realizing peace in the future lies in how to make the Communist Party sincerely accept the peace talks. It was decided to organize the Hubei Province Peace Promotion Association, and Li Shucheng, Yu Yuzhi, Ai Yuying, and others were appointed as preparatory committee members. In addition, telegrams were sent to various provinces and cities requesting them to send representatives of the people to Hubei to organize a nationwide peace promotion organization in order to find ways to overcome all difficulties in realizing peace.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 4th] The Hubei Provincial Assembly telegraphed Mao Zedong again today, requesting him to immediately cease fire and resume peace talks.

The entire country is eagerly anticipating and earnestly hoping that you will carefully consider and make a decisive decision, regard the trend of popular sentiment, and determine the grand plan for peace. First, strictly order all armies on the front lines to cease offensive operations, remain stationed in their respective areas, and obey orders for resolution.

<p>[Our Hankou Office, 4th] The Hubei Provincial Assembly passed the following measures to promote peace on the 3rd: (1) Telegraph Mao Zedong again, requesting him to immediately cease fire and reopen peace talks.

It stated in brief: China's eight years of war have exhausted the people's blood and sweat, and three years of internal strife have nearly exhausted the country's vitality. Being descendants of the Yellow Emperor, is it necessary to hasten ruin? It is especially hoped that the gentlemen of the Communist Party will observe the trend of popular sentiment, understand the unreliability of military force, abandon prejudices, and show sincerity to each other. Immediately cease the war and resolve all issues peacefully. The timing is urgent and fleeting. The gentlemen of the Communist Party will either be great figures of the Chinese nation forever or be the sinners of the Chinese nation forever. The principle is clear; the choice is yours.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The liaison association of national representatives from twenty-nine northern provinces and cities and various professional groups telegraphed the Communist Party authorities Mao Zedong et al. on the 4th, stressing the importance of the nation's lifeline and the people's livelihood, hoping to quickly adopt the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference and jointly discuss concrete measures for peace.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Editorial: Let the Master Speak! <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>During the three-day New Year's holiday, there was a major development in the overall national situation. The door to peace has been opened by the President's New Year's Day Message. From south to north, from east to west, the Chinese people seem to be smiling.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, the Chinese Communist Party's radio station is still vehemently criticizing the government's call for peace, saying that it is "a common conspiracy of the Chinese reactionaries and American aggressors" and that the British and French governments are also "supporting this policy of American imperialism." Therefore, they firmly advocate that "the revolution cannot be abandoned halfway" and must be fought to the end. We common people cannot help but feel that a layer of shadow is floating over the bright future.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Assembly, representing the six million citizens of Shanghai, took the lead on the 2nd in telegraphing both the government and the Communist Party, calling for an immediate ceasefire and the start of negotiations. The All-Circles Self-Salvation and National Salvation Joint Association followed suit with its own proposals, and advised both sides to hold talks in Shanghai. Assemblies and National Assembly representatives from provinces and cities in North China, and the assemblies of Sichuan and Hubei provinces, have all issued similarly urgent appeals. We believe that the people of other provinces and cities will also rise up like a storm and shout out demands for a ceasefire. This is a glimmer of peace, and it is also the beginning of the real people speaking!</p>
<p>The President's Message said, "If peace can be realized, I will not be concerned about my personal advance or retreat, and I will only follow the will of the people." His frankness and sincerity are unanimously considered by domestic and foreign public opinion to be beyond doubt. The key to war or peace in the future, which is also the key to the people's fortune or misfortune, is indeed, as the Shanghai Municipal Assembly telegram said, truly dependent on a single thought of the gentlemen of the Communist Party. We believe that today is the time for the masters of the country to speak earnestly to the Communist Party.</p>
<p>After eight years of war, China should have been able to strive for construction in the peaceful atmosphere of broad daylight. But unfortunately, for the past three years, the entire China has been shrouded in gunpowder smoke, cannon fire, and clouds of sorrow and darkness, still under a low-pressure system! We common people are facing a great disaster, everyone is afraid of destruction, everyone is asking for survival. At this urgent time, how can we not cry out loudly and emit a resounding echo from the bottom of our hearts? The common people are the masters of the country, and the government is to serve the common people and make them happy. Therefore, regardless of whether the ruling party is elected by the people or obtains power through other methods, it must come up with the best possible measures in its work to truly meet the needs of the common people and realize immediate benefits. Only in this way can it gain the support of the entire population. Any political party that only deceives the people with empty propaganda and high-sounding rhetoric, but in practice uses force as a tool to seize power, exhausting the people and mobilizing troops, killing people and filling the fields, and giving the people endless suffering, is what we resolutely oppose.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the Chinese Communist Party claims to "liberate" the people, but its intention is to seize power. But whether it is "liberation" or seizure, it cannot but admit that the people are the masters of the country. Then, under the circumstances of continuous wars and frozen snowy weather, using "human waves" as tactics and treating the common people as straw dogs, such cruel massacres cannot be what the masters want to see. Look: seas of blood and mountains of corpses, scorched earth! Who does not have parents? Who does not have children? Partings of life and death, crying from hunger and cold, heartbreaking and tragic sights, we cannot bear to speak of! We believe that the gentlemen of the Communist Party certainly possess a conscience and love peace. Who does not want to be like us? Since the President has already sincerely advocated peace, why must the Communist Party fight to the end and inflict more suffering on the Chinese people?</p>
<p>Mencius said, "Calamities sent by Heaven may be avoided; but when we bring on calamities ourselves, it is impossible to live." We ask: Now that the door to peace has been opened, why should the masters stand idly by and let a few people act willfully and destroy our country?</p>
<p>The failure of the previous Political Consultative Conference was because the real masters of the country did not participate, did not speak, did not make a public judgment, and did not use their power to stop the use of force. If we want to realize peace now, both sides should respect the speech of the masters. Only the masters can decide everything and can make a public judgment on right and wrong.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Charter is the most important document of modern times and the foundation of human glory. It was proclaimed by the great political leaders of many countries, and it should be followed by billions of people in the future. The Atlantic Charter clearly proclaims to us that everyone has the right to determine their own way of life and the appropriate form of government they should adopt. The President's Message points out that as long as the peace negotiations do not harm the independence and integrity of the country, help the people recuperate and rest, do not violate the Constitution, guarantee the army, and allow the people to maintain their free way of life and current minimum standard of living, then he has no other demands. We believe that this has indeed opened the door to peace. If the Communist Party is also sincere, both sides should immediately issue orders to truly cease fire and have people's representatives and impartial international personnel conduct on-site inspections. At the same time, within the territory of the Republic of China, the most suitable place should be quickly selected (such as Shanghai), and representatives responsible for negotiations should be sent by both the government and the Communist Party. Under the fair observation of national people's representatives and international personnel, they should meet each other with sincerity and properly discuss a way to resolve all disputes. Everything should be based on the will of the people, and the points of contention that cannot be resolved should be ultimately decided by the public judgment of the people's representatives. From then on, we will cease warfare forever and engage in production and construction, so that the common people can live and work in peace and contentment. If that is still not possible, we can also appeal to the world peace organization - the United Nations - to arbitrate the disputes. This is also a reasonable way to resolve them peacefully.</p>
<p>We think: India and Pakistan can cease disputes, Jews and Arabs can cease fire, why can't we Chinese people stop the domestic war? Only the Chinese people can save the troubled China! Our fate must be decided by ourselves and saved by ourselves! We want the political parties that advocate war to quickly abandon the use of force! At the same time, we want to transform and innovate! The old and unreasonable things, we need to sanction and reform; the new and reasonable things, we are willing to accept and experience. We want to reject the totalitarian, autocratic, and enslaved life; we want to cherish the democratic, free, and modern life. Anyone who is unwilling to give peace to the people is the enemy of the people!</p>

<p>[Our Suzhou Office, 4th] Not long after the Jiangya incident, a major shipwreck tragedy occurred near Luhu Township, under the jurisdiction of Wujiang County, last night. Due to the cold weather and cold water, more than one hundred passengers tragically drowned. It is reported that the Shenhu route passenger ferry of the D昌轮船局 (Dachang Steamboat Bureau) under the Pujiang Inland River Shipping Company sailed from Huzhou to Shanghai yesterday morning. When it arrived at Luhu Township, it was nearly 10 p.m. After passengers got on and off, it had been sailing for only a few minutes when the ship suddenly tilted and sank. Passengers woke up in shock from their sleep, but because it was dark and they could not distinguish directions, and because the ship sank too quickly, they did not have time to escape. As a result, of the more than two hundred people, only fifty-odd were rescued, and the rest were buried in the water. Afterwards, the steamboat bureau tried to keep the incident secret and prevent it from leaking out. The Wujiang County Government, upon receiving the report, has ordered a thorough investigation of the incident and is actively handling the aftermath. According to the rescued passengers, when the ship left Huzhou, in addition to being fully loaded with passengers, it was also loaded with more than ten pieces of local silk and more than forty 名 of rice. At Nanxun, another forty 石 of rice were added. Moreover, there were no winds or waves that night, and the waterway was not dangerous. Therefore, the cause of the shipwreck was actually overloading.</p>

First, he said: We are spending the New Year in the midst of artillery fire, and it is precisely in the midst of the military, political, and civilian unity in defending Taiyuan and repeatedly thwarting the invading bandits that we are spending the New Year. In the three months of the defense battle, relying on our heroic officers and soldiers, pressing forward without hesitation, and severely annihilating the invading bandits, as well as the efforts of our people to destroy their homes to relieve the country's difficulties and support the front lines, we gave the enemy the greatest blow, achieved brilliant results, and laid the foundation for the victory of the Taiyuan defense battle. Then reveal the overall goals of the entire effort: (1) In the overall efforts of the military, political, and civilian sectors, we must continue to consolidate and expand the battle city, thoroughly implement the action program of the battle city, establish a battle system that combines life, production, and battle, and realize the four equalities of right and wrong, labor, life, and sacrifice, in order to lay the foundation for the success of the revival. (2) In the military, we must implement a streamlined army and complete a strong army that is sure to defend and sure to attack, using a blazing sea of fire to eliminate the Communist bandits' cruel "human waves." (3) In politics, everything must be for battle, and everything must support the front lines. Finally, he said, the Third Year of Revival is our most difficult year, and it is also the year to strive for victory. All our military and civilians must be determined to make the greatest effort, dedicate all our strength, repel the enemy's encirclement, and recover the entire province in one fell swoop.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Reflection of Peace on the Front Line: National Army Soldiers Doubt the Sincerity of the Communists; A Communist Soldier Says He Misses Home <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Correspondent, Ji Ang, Beiping, 4th] The concern for peace among the lower-ranking soldiers of both the Nationalists and Communists seems to be no less than that of the high-ranking officials. On the 4th, the reporter braved the cold to go to the front line outside Beiping City to talk with the National Army and entered the Communist area to chat with the Communist soldiers.</p>
<p>The reporter talked with a young National Army soldier in the freezing wind. The soldier pointed to the Communist defense line across the snow-covered fields and said: "The Communists say they want peace, and President Chiang has declared that the government wants peace. If both sides are sincere, they should reach an agreement immediately, because if it drags on for another year, the Chinese people will be finished." He then said: "But are the Communists really sincere? According to the farmers, the slogans posted by the Communists on the walls of the villages say: 'Down with Fu Zuoyi, and then there will be peace.' But everyone knows that General Fu is a good man and a good general. General Fu has gained more hope among the people than any other National Army leader. If the Communists want to talk about peace after overthrowing such a good man, what is their sincerity?" The reporter crossed the snow-covered fields and entered the Communist defense line. The first people he met were two Communist soldiers squatting by the roadside, basking in the sun. The earflaps of their leather caps covered their ears, and their light machine guns were placed on their laps. They did not stand up when they saw the reporter approaching, but only shouted, "Where are you going?" The reporter told them, "I am a foreign news reporter, and I came here to chat with you." They then took the reporter to a farmhouse by the roadside, where seven Communist soldiers were huddled around a fire to keep warm.</p>
<p>One of them asked the reporter: "Has peace come?"</p>
<p>They invited the reporter to sit on a bench, and the reporter asked them what they had heard about the peace talks. They said they had only heard that Nanjing was discussing the issue.</p>
<p>The reporter asked: "Is peace possible?"</p>
<p>Several people replied: "We don't know." One of them said: "I really hope for peace, because I have been fighting for seven years, and I really want to go home."</p>
<p>Another person asked me if there were any movie theaters in Beiping. He said that he hoped peace could come immediately, because he wanted to see a movie. Until now, he had only heard the word "movie."</p>
<p>Another older Communist soldier, possibly an officer, asked the reporter about the United States' attitude towards the establishment of a coalition government including the Communist Party. The reporter replied that he did not know and asked about the Soviet Union's attitude towards the establishment of a coalition government in China. One Communist soldier angrily replied: "The Chinese government is a matter for China, not for the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>When the reporter left, they saluted him. When the reporter returned to the National Army defense line and walked towards the city gate, a National Army officer smiled at the reporter.</p>
<h3 id="e42">President Chiang's New Year's Day Address Explains the Meaning of Advocating Peace; Sun Ke's New Year's Day Broadcast Says Peace Requires Everyone's Efforts <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] President Chiang presided over the New Year's Day group worship ceremony on the morning of the 1st at 11:00 AM and delivered a brief speech, which stated: Recalling the revolutionary history of the past 37 years, we feel very ashamed and even more inspired by the spirit of our leader, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who led our party members in 40 years of arduous struggle when he was alive. Today, I have issued a New Year's Day message explaining the significance of advocating peace in order to alleviate the suffering of the people in the face of the temporary setbacks suffered by the current revolutionary cause, and clarifying that peace and nation-building is the consistent policy of the government. I have also listed the facts that the government has compromised and sought peace with the Communist Party over the past three years to let everyone know that my proposal for peace today is not because the government does not have the strength to continue fighting. It is precisely because we still have great combat power that we can advocate peace. Otherwise, without combat power, how can we talk about peace again? As the saying goes, you cannot have peace without being able to fight, which means that you can have peace only if you can fight. This is the reason why I am advocating peace today. We must know that the government's strength in military, political, and economic aspects is several times or even dozens of times greater than that of the Communist Party. Although the army has encountered many setbacks since the battles in the Northeast, it still has the advantage in terms of both quantity and quality. In particular, the air force and navy are beyond the ability of the Communist Party to compete. In addition, the foundation of politics and economy is also beyond the reach of the Communist Party. What is regrettable now is that some people in our government have been affected by the Communist Party's evil propaganda, and their minds have been shaken, almost losing confidence. Because they are spiritually threatened by the Communist Party, they only see the enemy's strength and do not see that they still have dozens of times more power than the enemy. Everyone knows that when our National Revolution first started in Guangdong, it only had two regiments of troops, but it finally unified the country and was later able to win the final victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Our government today has such a solid foundation and strong power. If we can restore the revolutionary spirit of that time, then what kind of bandit rebellion cannot be quelled? Therefore, our advocacy of peace today is not to avoid war and seek peace, but to be able to fight and to be able to have peace, leaving it to the Communist Party to choose. If the Communist Party is truly sincere in seeking peace, the government is willing to implement a peaceful policy of political resolution to alleviate the suffering of the people and preserve the vitality of the country. This is the most important point of my message today, which is "to plead for the people," and everyone must deeply understand it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Executive Yuan President Sun broadcast the following full text on New Year's Day evening at the Central Broadcasting Station: "A new year begins, and everything is renewed." The difficult, war-torn year of the Republic of China 37 has passed, and the New Year's Day of the Republic of China 38 has arrived. At the beginning of this new year, all the people of the country naturally share the same heart and the same reason in praying for peace, stability, and happiness. The President also issued a message today, declaring his determination to strive for peace and expressing the government's sincerity in seeking peace. I believe that this is not only good news for the entire Chinese people, but also the most desirable news for friends from all over the world to hear.</p>
<p>Recalling three years ago, at the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, because the people needed to recuperate, because the country needed to actively build, and because the various parties had a common understanding of the needs of the country and the people, we once gathered representatives from all parties and social elites together to hold a Political Consultative Conference. After three weeks of efforts, and thanks to the good offices of President Truman's special envoy, Mr. Marshall, we also agreed on a program for peaceful nation-building and concrete plans to resolve various disputes. If we had been able to implement the various plans in a timely manner at that time, I ask you, how prosperous should China be today, and how happy should the Chinese people be today! Unfortunately, the various parties failed to completely abandon their petty interests at that time, and the people of the whole country also failed to make their best efforts to promote the success of this peace movement, which led to the recurrence of war and the devastation of life. In the past three years, not only has the loss of people's lives and property been incalculable, but even the glimmer of hope that the country had after eight years of resistance against Japan has almost been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Today, our head of state, President Chiang, has once again announced his determination to seek peace for the country and has stated that as long as peace can be achieved, his personal advancement and retreat will not be of concern, but will only be in accordance with the public opinion of the people. President Chiang's statement is so open and aboveboard. This is truly a new hope for the future of the country and a new opportunity for the people of the whole country. I personally have never dared to lag behind in my efforts to seek peace for the country. Now, at this time, I have assumed the important responsibility of the President of the Executive Yuan. I will surely uphold my long-standing aspirations for peace and make the greatest efforts to achieve peace. However, peace cannot be achieved by the efforts of a few people alone. It must be achieved by the joint efforts of everyone in order to achieve this common goal. Therefore, I hope:</p>
<p>First,</p>
<p>The soldiers of the National Army on the front line must hold their positions with the bravest and strongest will. They must not be disturbed by the government's announcement of its intention for peace. Recently, the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, the Taiyuan Campaign, and the Pingjin Campaign have turned the tide of the war thanks to the loyalty and sacrifice of the officers and soldiers on the front line. The whole country admires them. Now, when the government is striving for peace, it must rely on the officers and soldiers on the front line to make the greatest and final efforts to guarantee the success of peace.</p>
<p>Second,</p>
<p>Peace is a matter for both sides. Peace can only be achieved if both sides have the sincerity and determination to seek peace. Today, the government's intention to seek peace has been clearly stated to the world. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will also deeply recognize that peace is a major issue concerning their own survival and will rise up to make organized efforts so that the Communist Party will also understand the trend of public opinion and take the interests of the country and the people as the most important thing, immediately stop military actions, and, on the premise of safeguarding the country's independence and integrity and maintaining the people's freedom, jointly seek the thorough realization of peaceful unification and democratic constitutionalism to relieve the people of their current suffering.</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, your contributions to the country and the sacrifices you have made for the nation during the eight years of resistance against Japan have reached the highest and greatest limits. However, after eight years of resistance against Japan, you still have to endure the pain of conscription, requisitioning of grain, and price fluctuations every day. The government also feels this pain as if it were cutting our own flesh. The government is now considering thoroughly reforming the methods of conscription and requisitioning of grain in the near future to reduce the suffering of the people in the vast rural areas. It is also seeking the most effective methods to stabilize prices, hoping to provide the people with a more stable guarantee of life. In short, the government will spare no effort to do everything that can alleviate the suffering of the people and increase the welfare of the people, so that the government and the people can unite in spirit and in fact, work together to overcome the current difficulties, and jointly create a bright, prosperous, and happy future.</p>
<h3 id="e43">CPC Party Headquarters Commemoration Week, President Sun Attends and Reports <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held the first commemoration week of the 38th year on the morning of the 3rd. President Chiang presided over the meeting, and President Sun attended and reported. Sun said: He was appointed by the President to be responsible for the Executive Yuan without any preparation, but he could not refuse. He has been at the Executive Yuan for two weeks, and everything is in the process of organization and planning. Therefore, there are no concrete decisions on the policies of the Executive Yuan in the future, so he cannot report on the policy guidelines. Sun continued: The 38th year has now begun.</p>
<p>"The plan for the year lies in the spring." We should review where our past mistakes lie and why we have encountered all kinds of setbacks and failures, and strive to correct them. In particular, we should lead the rural areas so that the vast human and material resources can be used for combat. Sun concluded: The President issued a message on New Year's Day, announcing internally and externally that the use of force was a last resort and expressing the government's willingness to restore peace. If the Communist Party can realize this and also express its willingness to seek peace, then peace is not impossible. The political circles in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the media at home and abroad, have been deeply impressed by the President's message, acknowledging that the government has opened the door to peace. Now it depends on the Communist Party's attitude and whether it can understand the government's desire for peace and seek a peaceful solution.</p>

<h3 id="e44">New Leaders of the U.S. Congress Clearly State that They Will Maintain a Bipartisan Foreign Policy; Truman Scheduled to Deliver State of the Union Address Today <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 3rd] Two leaders of the U.S. Congress stated today that they support continuing to maintain a bipartisan foreign policy. At the first meeting of the new House of Representatives today, Democratic Representative Rayburn, who was elected Speaker of the House, urged the continued implementation of bipartisan diplomacy. He delivered a brief speech stating, "You will inevitably disagree on many domestic issues, but on all international issues, I hope there will be greater consistency." Democratic Senator Connally, who will serve as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared that he will work to promote a bipartisan foreign policy. This policy is the one that he and Vandenberg worked together to implement. Connally said, "In this time of global turbulence, we must have an American foreign policy, not a Republican or Democratic foreign policy." He assured that the committee he leads will first pay attention to the new recovery plan for Western Europe and military assistance to Western Europe. He believes that the most important thing at present is to continue the European Recovery Program for another fifteen months.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] President Truman will submit a plan to Congress on the 4th for high taxes and huge expenditures. This plan relies heavily on Speaker of the House Rayburn to promote its implementation in the tradition of Roosevelt. When Truman's annual Federal State of the Union address is read to a joint session of Congress, it will outline the general outline of the plan. Rayburn has been given great power and will work to ensure that the bill is approved by the House. In 1910, Speaker Cannon's power was too great, and he was almost dictatorial. The House amended the House Rules to strip him of most of his power. Truman's address recommends focusing on four major domestic issues: taxation, labor legislation, economic regulation, and human rights legislation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] The 81st U.S. Congress, under Democratic control, opened here at noon today. President Truman will attend Congress on Wednesday to present the Federal State of the Union Address, and on Friday, he will present a special address on economic issues. On Monday of next week, he will present the budget address for this year. Around January 20, the President will present his fourth address. According to informed sources, this address will be a detailed outline of foreign policy and will state the United States' support for the Atlantic Treaty. Even if the President does not present the full text of the draft treaty, he will present the outline of the treaty. In the address, the President may request a budget of $43 billion, which is the largest budget in peacetime. Informed sources said that the President will make the following requests: (1) increase taxes; (2) authorize the control and distribution of various scarce raw materials; (3) increase the minimum wage from 40 cents per hour to 75 cents per hour; (4) increase social security pensions by 50%; (5) extend export controls that expire on June 30. Political figures believe that the result of the new Congress will have a major impact on the world, especially on the progress of the Cold War between the East and West blocs.</p>
<h3 id="e45">President Truman Gains the Upper Hand for the First Time; House Rules of Procedure Revised; Powers of the Rules Committee Greatly Reduced; Rayburn and McKellar Elected as Speakers of the House and Senate <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] Democratic leader Rayburn was elected Speaker of the House with a majority of 255 votes at the beginning of the new Congress today, succeeding former Speaker Martin. Democratic Senator McKellar defeated Republican Speaker candidate Vandenberg by a vote of 50 to 40 and was elected Speaker of the Senate.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The new U.S. Congress opened today, and the government urged the House to adopt new rules of procedure to facilitate the passage of government bills. The new rules were immediately passed by a voice vote of 275 to 142, and the opposition of the Republicans and some Democratic members was ineffective. Members of Congress believe that this test is a test of President Truman's expanded power over Congress since the election in November last year. In the past, the Rules Committee had considerable power to shelve bills, not submitting them to the House for a vote, and had the right to decide which bills should be discussed by the House. In the future, if the Rules Committee does not submit a bill passed by the Legislative Committee to the House for discussion within 21 days, the chairman of the Legislative Committee can directly submit it to the House, and with the consent of the majority of representatives, the House can discuss it. Republican members said that recognizing the chairman of the Legislative Committee's power would allow Speaker of the House Rayburn to manipulate the agenda of the General Assembly. Both houses of Congress then announced a recess until the 5th, when President Truman will personally attend and deliver an address.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Senator Lucas has been elected as the Democratic leader of the Senate. Lucas will take office on January 20. The original Democratic leader of the Senate, Barkley, will take office as Vice President on that day and, in accordance with the U.S. Constitution, will assume the position of Chairman of the Senate. Lucas will also serve as Chairman of the Senate Democratic Conference and Chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee. Representative McCormack succeeds Rayburn as Democratic leader of the House.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] Republican senators today elected Cain of Wyoming as the party's leader in the Senate. Hay, who is a representative of the forward-looking members of the Republican Party, defeated William Nolan, another candidate representing the liberal members of the Republican Party. Republican senators also elected Taft as the candidate for Chairman of the Executive Committee of the party.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd, Associated Press] Patton, Chairman of the National Farmers' Association of the United States, suggested that Graham, former U.S. representative on the United Nations Indonesian Mediation Committee, succeed Forrestal as Secretary of Defense. Patton severely criticized Forrestal's report on military unification issued last week. He pointed out that Forrestal requested the enactment of legislation to enable military institutions to decide on war on their own without the approval of Congress.

<p>[United Press, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 2nd] The Dutch representative to the United Nations, Mr. van Roijen, flew to the United States today to attend the Security Council. Mr. van Roijen expects the Security Council to first discuss the Indonesian issue when it reconvenes on January 6th.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 3rd] The chief Indonesian representative to the United Nations, Mr. Palar, declared upon arriving in New York from Paris today: The Indonesian dispute is not merely a dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands, but also a dispute between the Netherlands and the Security Council. Mr. Palar expressed disappointment with the outcome of the recent Security Council meeting in Paris to discuss the Indonesian situation, stating that he will re-submit the case at the New York meeting, hoping to obtain a solution. He added that this case is like a political football, kicked around by the great powers. The chief Dutch representative to the Security Council, namely the Dutch Ambassador to Canada, Mr. van Roijen, also arrived in New York after Mr. Palar. Mr. van Roijen called the remarks of the Indonesian representative laughable, comparing the leaders of the Indonesian Republic to the leaders of Prussia in the past, who ruled the country by force and military action.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] According to authoritative sources, the United States' position on the Indonesian issue remains unchanged. In response to much speculation in the newspapers regarding the recent measures taken by the Security Council in Paris, this official statement is made to provide clarification. Authoritative sources here stated that the United States has not changed its position. This statement is of an informal nature, as the Indonesian issue is still on the Security Council's agenda, and the Council is scheduled to reconvene in the United States in January. The United States' position was clarified by Mr. Jessup in the Security Council on December 22nd. Mr. Jessup stated: "The United States government cannot determine whether the Netherlands has consistently or intentionally undermined the possibility of reopening negotiations under the mediation committee."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] According to reliable sources, the Japanese government plans to revise its five-year economic stabilization plan, hoping that by 1953, annual exports can reach US$2 billion, an increase of over US$500 million compared to the original target. This new economic stabilization plan will focus on export trade rather than the recovery of domestic industry, as Japan urgently needs foreign exchange, especially US dollars.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Officials announced that 75 of the Japanese zaibatsu industrial and commercial companies listed as subject to restrictions have been released. These 75 companies, which were under government supervision since the Japanese surrender due to their connections with the zaibatsu, can now resume their free and independent operations, just like other private enterprises.</p>

<p>[United Press, Batavia, 4th] Well-informed sources said today that Dutch forces will issue a ceasefire order as soon as they occupy the last major city in Sumatra, Pangkalan Brandan. Meanwhile, the Dutch representative today informed the United Nations Mediation Committee that a ceasefire order had been issued in Java on the 2nd, and they welcome the United Nations observer group to inspect the Dutch-occupied areas on the ground.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 3rd] Dutch forces today have almost completely occupied all major Indonesian cities in Sumatra.

According to a Dutch military communique, since the start of police action on December 19th, we have suffered a total of 66 deaths and 172 injuries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 3rd] The Dutch representative today sent a letter to the United Nations Mediation Committee and the consular corps, stating that all possible facilities will be provided to the supervisory personnel for this peace agreement to investigate the truth of the situation since December 12th of last year. The letter also included the full text of the ceasefire order issued by the Dutch authorities, but did not mention the Security Council's order to release the Prime Minister of the Republic, Sukarno, and other leaders of the Republic. A spokesperson for the Mediation Committee said that the committee is discussing with the consular corps how to dispatch military supervisory personnel to the newly occupied areas of the Netherlands within days.

<p>[Associated Press, Amsterdam, 4th] Dutch Prime Minister Drees flew to Batavia by special KLM flight on the morning of the 4th. The route he took was not disclosed. Before his departure, Drees told reporters that the Netherlands' Indonesian policy has two major goals: "One is to organize a fully transitional government that can represent all of Indonesia, and the other is to organize the United States of Indonesia, to which we will later transfer sovereignty. Therefore, elections must be held in Indonesia to decide on certain points." He also said that the initial intention of this trip was to "discuss the local political situation." He added that the Dutch government has always sought to reach an agreement with Indonesia through personal contact.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 4th] India today permitted a KLM aircraft carrying Dutch Prime Minister Drees to land in India en route to Indonesia. According to a government spokesman, Pakistan will also grant the same permission to the Dutch request, but it is unknown when Drees will depart.

<p>[United Press, Rangoon, 4th] A government spokesman said today that the Burmese government has not approved sending troops to Indonesia to assist in the fight against Dutch forces. The situation in Burma also does not allow a large amount of military supplies to be placed in private hands. Although former Prime Minister Ba Maw advocated sending troops, Burma needs to eliminate domestic lawlessness, and the existing military supplies are insufficient and still need to be purchased from abroad for the defense forces. Regarding the Indonesian issue, the actions Burma should take can be decided by the Asian Fourteen Nations Conference initiated by India.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 3rd] U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith told reporters after meeting with President Truman today that he had requested to be relieved of his duties in Moscow, but the President did not take any action on this request and hoped to discuss this matter with Smith again in the future. Smith reiterated his desire to be relieved of his duties in Moscow so that he could reside in his own country, as he has been away from his country for seven years, four years serving in the military and three years serving as U.S. Ambassador to Moscow. When reporters asked about the possibility of a split in the Soviet Politburo, Smith replied, "As far as we know, there has never been a split in the Politburo. It is possible to have various differing opinions before a policy decision is made, but there has never been a split in opinion after that." When asked to comment on President Truman's statement that some Soviet leaders are eager to establish friendly relations with the United States, Smith replied that he guessed that there are people in the Soviet Union who favor taking a more moderate path, but it is difficult to determine who these people are.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] The Supreme Court today, by a vote of six to one, refused to hear the appeal filed by five Japanese war criminals sentenced to imprisonment, and upheld the court's decision on December 10th of last year, that the Supreme Court has no authority to interfere with the decision made by the Tokyo International Military Tribunal.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida predicted on the 4th that his Liberal Democratic Party would win a major victory in the general election on the 23rd and occupy a majority of the 466 seats in the House of Representatives. The party only had 150 seats in the recently dissolved parliament. To win a majority, 234 members of the party must be elected.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] As cabinet members rush to electoral districts to prepare for the January 23rd general election, only staff members are left to hold the fort in the Japanese cabinet. Prime Minister Yoshida left Tokyo by car on the morning of the 4th to begin a long speaking tour in western Japan for the Liberal Democratic Party. Yoshida estimates that the party will occupy more than 200 of the 466 seats in the new House of Representatives. (The Liberal Democratic Party occupied about 150 seats in the dissolved old House of Representatives.) The chairman of the Socialist Party, former Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama, also left Tokyo for a speaking tour in northern Honshu. As the Socialist Party has not responded to MacArthur's order prohibiting strikes by civil servants, which has caused some labor groups to become estranged, the party will have to make every effort to increase its seats in the new House of Representatives (in the old House of Representatives, the Socialist Party occupied about 100 seats). As of the evening of the 3rd, a total of 1,343 people have registered to participate in the election, of which 842 are new faces participating in the election for the first time, indicating that all parties hope to inject "new blood." Although the old House of Representatives was notorious for corruption cases, 423 former members of the House of Representatives continue to participate in the election.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 3rd] Responsible sources said today that the United States has notified Israel that if Jewish forces invade neighboring Arab countries, they will lose U.S. diplomatic recognition. This special action came after the British government issued a warning.</p>
<p>According to British sources, Britain has military alliance relations with Arab countries and may be drawn into the Middle East war. The U.S. Embassy declined to comment on this. British Ambassador to the United States Franks was scheduled to meet with President Truman today, but the meeting was cancelled. The White House did not provide any explanation for this, nor did it schedule another meeting. Previously, Franks met with U.S. Acting Secretary of State Lovett last Friday, asking the U.S. government to use its influence to prevent Jewish forces from crossing the border, otherwise Britain, due to its military alliance relations, may be forced to assist its Arab allies. The United States immediately sent a note to the Israeli government, condemning the Jewish forces for crossing the border and invading neighboring countries. The Israeli government replied to the U.S. State Department's warning today, but its contents have not been announced. It is reported that Britain is quite shocked by the appearance of Israeli forces near the Palestinian-Egyptian border, which is only 120 miles from the Suez Canal. Britain will not allow any invading troops to approach the Suez Canal, and has mutual assistance obligations to Egypt and Outer Jordan and Iraq. If this treaty is invoked, Britain must take action.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 3rd] The United States, Britain, and France asked the Soviet Union on the 3rd to explain how many German prisoners of war are still being detained and why they have not been released by midnight at the end of last year in accordance with the formal agreement between the Allies. It was announced that the Western Allies submitted this request separately to the Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow through their embassies in the Soviet Union. The contents of the note will not be released until the 5th. However, it is learned that the note mentioned the publicly available information that the Soviet Union is still detaining nearly one million Germans, and there are many more who may not have been counted. It is also rumored that the Soviet Union is still detaining hundreds of thousands of Japanese prisoners of war in Siberia. The four powers agreed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow on April 23, 1947, to release all German prisoners of war by midnight on December 31, 1947. The Soviet Union at that time admitted to detaining 890,532 Germans, France detained 641,483, Britain detained 435,295, and the United States detained 16,103. But one of the great mysteries after the war is what happened to the three million Germans who disappeared in the Soviet Union. After the Moscow agreement was signed, the Western Allies have released all prisoners of war except for war criminals and other ordinary criminals. Therefore, a spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry denied the Soviet claim that France is still detaining 400,000 Germans.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 4th] TASS scoffed at the claim by Britain and the United States on the 4th that the Soviet Union is still detaining many German prisoners of war. The agency said that the absolute majority of Soviet-German prisoners of war have been repatriated to Germany, and denounced Britain and the United States for detaining a large number of prisoners of war under the pretext that they voluntarily stayed in the two countries and were freely employed. TASS also denied that the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow last year made a positive decision on the repatriation issue, and claimed that the Foreign Ministers' Conference transferred this proposal to the Allied Control Council for Germany. The agency said that Britain and France vetoed this proposal in the Allied Control Council. TASS also stated that although the "absolute majority" of German prisoners of war have been repatriated, "the repatriation of the remaining prisoners of war is being carried out in accordance with the plan adopted by the Soviet government and will be completed in 1949." TASS further accused that "Hitler had exiled 50,000 Soviet citizens to Germany during the war, who were detained by Britain and France after the war and are currently being held in concentration camps in the British, American, and French occupied zones of Germany."</p>

<h3 id="e65">Closing Ceremony of the Senate General Assembly Today; Lively Discussion on the Competition of Gold and Silver; Resolution to Request Continued Operation at the Original Price Without Restrictions <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Our News] The eighth general assembly of the Municipal Senate held its fourth meeting at the Senate Hall on Tanggu Road at 3:30 pm yesterday. Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, and 137 senators attended, and Mayor Wu and more than 20 directors of municipal bureaus attended as observers. After the Secretariat completed its report, Speaker Pan presided over the discussion of proposals on finance, civil affairs, police affairs, public works, social affairs, health, regulations, and other aspects. The meeting adjourned at about 7:00 pm. The general assembly was originally scheduled to close yesterday, but because of the heated discussion on the issue of gold exchange in the social affairs proposals, senators spoke enthusiastically and opinions differed greatly, lasting for quite a long time, causing the discussion of proposals to not be completed as scheduled. At about 6:00 pm, the assembly unanimously passed a resolution to extend the general assembly for one day. Today, the assembly will continue to discuss temporary proposals and hold the closing ceremony.</p>
<p>The following is a record of the discussion and resolutions of various proposals yesterday: In the social affairs proposals, the issue of gold exchange aroused heated discussion. More than ten people, including Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhou Lianze, Wang Yansong, Zhou Xuexiang, Jiang Haoran, Shui Xiangyun, Tong Xingbai, Zhang Zhihan, and Zhang Yiqu, spoke successively. Finally, because the five proposals in the social affairs section were of the same nature, it was decided to discuss them together. The reasons for each case are as follows: (1) Recently, commodity prices in this city have soared, which has greatly affected the lives of citizens. The Senate should immediately write to the municipal government authorities to promptly devise a way to strictly curb it to ensure people's livelihood. (2) The method of gold and silver exchange has been changed repeatedly, which has fluctuated finance and stimulated commodity prices. The government should immediately telegraph the central government to handle it solemnly, and do not change it easily, resulting in the loss of currency trust. (3) It is proposed to ask the central government to change the method of gold exchange, and mint and issue gold yuan to circulate in the market to strengthen currency trust and stabilize commodity prices. (4) It is proposed to suggest that the authorities allow workers to deposit and exchange gold and silver to avoid partiality. (5) In order to ensure the stability of currency value, stabilize commodity prices, and completely eliminate the black market for gold and panic buying, the Senate should urgently telegraph the Ministry of Finance to earnestly implement unrestricted gold exchange to benefit people's livelihood. As a result of the combined discussion of the above five cases, the following resolutions were made: The Senate telegraphed the central government to continue to implement the policy of unrestricted exchange of gold and silver at the original price, and asked the government to sell a large amount of materials to strengthen currency trust.</p>

<h3 id="e74">The Sanbei Mingxing Vessel to Sail to Ningbo for the First Time Tomorrow, Carrying Four Coffins of Yu Qiaqing and Others <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai-Ningbo route has the highest number of passengers. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company originally had the Jiangjing and Jiangya vessels, which sailed daily between Shanghai and Ningbo, except on Sundays. Since the Jiangya vessel accident, the company had no vessels to dispatch, so the Jiangjing vessel sailed alone, once every other day. Although the Ping An Company's Dahua vessel and the Taichangxiang Jiangsu vessel have been converted to sail the Shanghai-Ningbo route on a dedicated schedule, they do not carry many passengers, so passengers still cannot be fully transported. The Sanbei Shipping Company originally had the Ningxing vessel dedicated to sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo before the war, but it was unable to resume sailing after the victory due to a lack of ships. Recently, seeing the crowded passengers on the route, it is planned to transfer the Mingxing vessel to the Shanghai-Ningbo route. The vessel is the company's most excellent passenger vessel, originally sailing the Shanghai-Hankou route, with a gross tonnage of 2,300 tons, capable of loading 1,600 tons, and carrying 2,000 passengers. It is scheduled to sail to Ningbo for the first time tomorrow. However, it will not carry passengers for the first time, but will only transport two coffins of the late General Manager Yu Qiaqing and his wife and one coffin of the Teng family, as well as one coffin declared by the Xin Gong Customs Broker, for a total of four coffins. After the coffins of Yu Qiao Lao and his wife arrive in Ningbo, they will be transported by special train to Sanbei Longshan for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Various Organizations Issue Telegrams, Supporting the President's Advocacy of Peace, Calling on the CCP to Lay Down Their Weapons as Soon as Possible <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the President's New Year's Day proclamation, the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, the General Association, the Municipal Industrial Association, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Women's Association, the Kuomintang Municipal Party Department, the Democratic Socialist Party Municipal Party Department, and the Youth Party Municipal Party Department have all responded and issued telegrams, calling on the people of the country to support President Chiang's advocacy of peace. The original telegram is as follows: "All provincial and municipal senates, organizations, newspapers, news agencies, and the people of the country, as a whole: Since the War of Resistance against Japan and the suppression of the rebellion, wars have been continuous for eleven years. The turmoil of war has caused suffering to the people. Our President Chiang Kai-shek, in order to protect the national lifeline and cherish the lives of the people, deeply hopes that the war will not be prolonged, so he issued a proclamation on New Year's Day, advocating peace, which is kind and sincere. The gate of peace has been opened, and the opportunity to turn misfortune into good fortune has arrived. Whether the overall situation in the future is war or peace, and whether the people suffer or prosper, all depends on the CCP's thoughts. If the CCP can feel the President's sincerity and value the lives of the people over political views, then reopening peace talks, discussing national affairs together, turning swords into plowshares, eliminating hostility, and turning into auspiciousness is as easy as turning one's hand. If they still stubbornly adhere to their prejudices and insist on rebellion, then the responsibility for the war in the future will be entirely on the CCP. It will not only fail to live up to the President's sincerity in advocating peace and our people's desire for peace, but it will also be criticized by friendly nations around the world who love peace and become a sinner of all ages and a public enemy of the people of the country. It is hoped that all our compatriots will rise up to support the President's great call and call on the CCP to wake up as soon as possible, lay down their weapons, and immediately make peace talks. Then the country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. Shanghai Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, General Association, Municipal Industrial Association, Municipal Education Association, Municipal Women's Association, Kuomintang Municipal Party Department, Democratic Socialist Party Municipal Party Department, Youth Party Municipal Party Department (Zi) (Jiang) together."</p>
<p>According to another report, before the above organizations issued the telegram, the Municipal Senate first telegraphed on that day, calling for peace. The Senate passed three telegrams on the evening of the 2nd during the New Year's dinner, one to the President and the central government, one to the Chinese Communist Party, and one to all provinces and cities, calling on the Communist Party to agree to a ceasefire and listen to both sides sending representatives to have an open and honest discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Shanghai Legislative Councilors' Association Held a Symposium Yesterday, Exchanging Views on the Situation and Agreeing to Resume Peace Talks <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Legislative Councilors' Association held a symposium last night to exchange views on the situation. More than a dozen people attended, chaired by Fei Xia. President Tong Guanxian also took time to attend, but left midway due to business before the end of the meeting. It is learned that the legislative councilors who participated in the talks unanimously agreed to resume peace talks and expressed their deep admiration for the head of state's sincerity in seeking domestic peace without regard to personal interests. However, at the same time, they believe that it is difficult to resume peace talks at this time and that "peace is more difficult than war" in terms of the actual situation. Regarding the way of conducting peace, the legislative councilors spoke very enthusiastically, and their opinions can be roughly divided into three categories: In view of the long-term hatred between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the past, direct consultation is obviously difficult. In order to achieve the success of peace talks, people from all walks of life outside the two parties should form a third party to mediate. Today, not only does the government have the sincerity of peace, but there is no lack of people inside the Communist Party who advocate peace. At the same time, the people under the rule of both sides are eager for peace, so if the power of the people can be actively exerted today, although the process of peace will be difficult, it will eventually be successful. Today's international situation also urgently needs peace, and China's civil war is a hindrance to international coordination. Relevant countries also hope that our country's internal disputes can turn swords into plowshares. Therefore, in the process of striving for peace, international forces should also be used. According to a legislative councilor who attended the meeting, the talks were entirely for the purpose of exchanging views. Similar meetings will continue to be held, and once a conclusion is reached, there may be specific opinions made public to the society.</p>

<p>Report from this newspaper. Blacksmith Xia Fa and Zhou Xijiu stole 84 meters of electrical wire and five large and small lead weights from the Shanghai Electric Bureau's wires mounted on telephone poles on Dalin Road, Lin Yin Road on the afternoon of September 8th of last year. That same day they sold the stolen goods for twenty one dollar per piece. An argument broke out between them due to uneven distribution of the stolen goods. Xia held a grudge. On the 14th of the same month, he pried open the door of Zhou's room and took a small knife from the table, intending to kill Zhou, but Zhou discovered him, and his finger was slightly injured. In the 35th year of the Republic, Xia secretly manufactured a handgun in Changzhou, intending to kill his uncle, but his teacher learned of this and informed Xia's father, who melted the gun. Xia then became angry at the teacher's son, Zhang, and conspired to murder him. He invited Zhou to lure Huanzhang to a deserted area of Zhutoubang, where Xia used two prepared ropes to strangle him to death. The police combined the two cases and sent them to the District Court for handling. The District Court yesterday sentenced Xia Fa to life imprisonment for murder and nine months in prison for theft.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] A tragic car accident occurred on the Shanghai-Wuxi highway on the [blank]th, resulting in more than ten deaths and injuries. The car, a No. 03 transportation vehicle from the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, was borrowed by Bao Xiaopeng, the director of the Second Garage of the Public Bus Company. Bao, who was newly married, took advantage of the holiday to return to his hometown in Taicang to hold a wedding banquet. The car was borrowed by Bao to pick up and drop off relatives and friends. In addition to Bao himself, the car also contained his bride Xu Xianzhao, Bao's sister Xiangyun, Gu Zhenbai and his wife, the chief secretary of the Public Utilities Bureau, Li Jiyin, a staff member of the secretariat, as well as Bao's Jiaotong University classmate Feng Xianyao, and about forty others. The car was driven by Jiang Chunhua, a worker from the Tiantong Road Engineering Factory, and the coppersmith Wei Wenjie accompanied the car for repairs. After the car departed from Tiantong Road at 9 AM, it arrived at a wooden bridge half a kilometer away from Gelong Town at around 10:50 AM. The bridge deck broke, causing the car to overturn into the river. When nearby villagers heard the sound and rushed to the scene, they managed to break the car windows that were exposed above the water and rescue some passengers.

<h3 id="e99">Chaotic Paradise <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of this Newspaper</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Hangzhou on the 1st] In Hangzhou, the city of paradise, the most distinctive wartime scene is probably the railway station. The station is chaotic and crowded, giving the impression of a city already devastated by war. The station authorities blame everything on the war, resulting in passengers boarding without tickets, carriages packed like sardines, and uncertain train schedules. Delays of 30 to 40 minutes are considered normal, and waiting three to four hours is not uncommon.</p>
<p>Since the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign and the tense situation, this reporter has traveled back and forth on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line many times, and many friends also frequently travel between Shanghai and Hangzhou. They are all puzzled as to why train delays have become routine. According to people at the station, the biggest reason is that Hangzhou has no spare tracks. Military trains and evacuation trains often occupy all the tracks, making it impossible to coordinate the entry and exit of vehicles. Therefore, trains from Shanghai to Hangzhou stop at Linping, Jianqiao, and Liangshanmen to wait for the tracks to clear before entering the city station. This reason seems sufficient on the surface, but upon closer inspection, it is also somewhat unreasonable. If evacuation trains arrive at the city station, they can stop near the city station. If military trains arrive at the city station, they can be discussed with the commanders to be moved quickly. Moreover, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has spent a great deal of effort designing the Zhegan Railway for both routes, with Gengshanmen as the starting point for those going to Shanghai and Nanxingqiao as the starting point for those going to Jiangxi. Now, such a practice has had minimal effect on the starting points of Liangshanmen and Nanxingqiao. Furthermore, there are not many military trains, and evacuation trains do not occupy too much space.</p>
<p>Traffic Chaos and Suffering for Passengers</p>
<p>Wang Zuomin, the director of the Lushan Administration, came from Nanjing and asked this reporter why the railway traffic was so chaotic. Wang Yaming, the chairman of the Wuhan Daily News, took the train from Shanghai and did not arrive at the city station until after 6 o'clock. This reporter came to Hangzhou from Shanghai on the 30th of last year and waited for an hour and a half for a train at Gengshanmen. The passengers waiting for the train to Shanghai at the station stood in the wind and rain, their clothes soaked, and their packages and luggage immersed in the muddy water. Yet, no one at the station told the passengers when the train would arrive, leaving them to suffer even before disaster struck.</p>
<p>All difficulties can be overcome with human effort. Both lines should strive for the sake of millions of passengers. The Nanxingqiao Station on the Zhegan Railway is naturally not as orderly as desired, but we must remember that it was completed under difficult and arduous circumstances, and we ultimately express our sympathy and hope.</p>
<p>Special Evacuation Trains Run Regularly</p>
<p>It is said that the Zhegan Railway transported 26,398 family members of various central government agencies from the capital back to their hometowns from December 11th to December 25th. The most on one day was over a thousand, and the least on one day was over a hundred. The agencies evacuated included the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Examination Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Land Administration, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Finance, the United Logistics Headquarters, the Engineer School, the Infantry School, the Artillery School, the Central Party Headquarters, the High Court, the Postal Remittance and Savings Bureau, the Telecommunications Administration, the Central News Agency, and others. The fares paid were calculated according to the fares before December 6th, which was one-sixth of the current fares. Regarding the allocation of trains, from December 11th to December 21st, the railway prepared five trains, and special trains 311, 312, and 313 were regularly run to transport the family members of the evacuated agencies to Hengyang from Hangzhou. From December 22nd, in order to avoid the need for family members returning to their hometowns to transfer trains in Hangzhou, through trains 255 and 101 from Beijing to Hengyang and Beijing to Zhuzhou were operated, with ten trains prepared by the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, five by the Zhegan Railway, and two by the Jinpu Railway, for a total of seventeen trains. Regarding the ticket exchange method: each unit sent one representative to exchange tickets collectively, and exchanged second-class and third-class tickets separately according to the Beijing-issued ticket exchange certificates and the trains they were taking. From this, it is clear that the uncertain train schedules today are due more to human reasons than natural reasons.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that the railway can use all its wisdom and ability to quickly restore order and avoid unnecessary suffering for travelers.</p>
<p>Auction Houses Opening One After Another</p>
<p>Another scene of wartime in Hangzhou is the proliferation of auction houses. Since the victory, Hangzhou has not had an auction house. The history of auction houses in Hangzhou can be said to begin today. Since one auction house opened, many more have followed. The reason for the establishment of these auction houses is that many people in the area want to evacuate, so they auction off unnecessary items. Some people passing through Hangzhou feel strapped for cash, so they also auction off their belongings. Others are people living in this paradise who find life difficult, so they auction off some of their possessions. Compared to that, the number of people evacuating from Hangzhou is still in the minority, while those staying or passing through Hangzhou make up the majority. The largest number of people, however, are those in Hangzhou who find it difficult to make a living. These various reasons, these various items, all contain pages of sad history. In addition, the refugee students have left, and there are refugees wandering the streets. During the day, they beg along the streets in broken languages. At night, they huddle under the eaves, enduring the harsh winter.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper in Lanzhou on the 1st] With the winter vacation approaching, schools at all levels in Lanzhou are holding final exams. Among them, three young girls from the Municipal Lanyuan Experimental Elementary School, Lu Xiaozhen, Geng Jianhua, and Wang Shuqin, are only twelve or thirteen years old. On the eve of the final exams (the 28th), they ran away together. Their parents and the school reported the matter to the police station and began searching separately. On the 30th, a resident named Xie Yicun in Shilitian, a western suburb, reported that three female students were seen carrying bags and heading west. The police station immediately dispatched personnel by car to pursue them, catching up with them in Anning Fort, 29 kilometers from the city. When asked why they ran away and where they were going, they said it was because they were afraid of failing the exams and planned to go to school in Jiuquan. The police officers then took them back and handed them over to their parents for proper discipline. This matter, though small, raises a significant issue for our educators.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Tung Oil in Eastern Zhejiang <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Reporter Jiang Feng of This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Jinhua on the 1st] Tung oil is one of China's four major exports. In its golden age, it topped China's total exports and occupied a large and stable market abroad. Tung oil production areas in China are widely distributed, covering sixteen provinces, including Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Fujian, Guangdong, Kang, Yunnan, Gansu, and Jiangsu. Zhejiang's tung oil production ranks fourth among the country's oil-producing provinces, with an annual output of about 500,000 piculs. Zhejiang's tung oil production areas are mostly in the counties commonly known as eastern Zhejiang, including the old Jin, Qu, Yan, Chu, Tai, and Wen counties.</p>
<p>Before the Anti-Japanese War, Zhejiang Province actively promoted tung tree planting, and annual output increased year by year. At that time, the highest price per picul was about 25 yuan, equivalent to about 600 catties of rice. Therefore, farmers were very interested in planting tung trees, and the planting area expanded very rapidly. At that time, the agricultural administration authorities in Zhejiang Province paid close attention to the promotion of tung trees. As early as the 24th year of the Republic of China, the Zhejiang Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Management Committee was established and set up an office for wasteland reclamation in Shili, Qu County. The office cultivated tung trees simultaneously in the suburbs of Jiangshan, the Lutaishan area of Sheng County, and other places as a promotion demonstration, with remarkable results.</p>
<p>During the later stages of the Anti-Japanese War, when the flames of war spread to the Pacific, the export of tung oil was hopeless, and the price plummeted, with each picul of tung oil only equivalent to about 150 catties of rice. Coupled with the wartime shortage of food and the high price of grain, farmers mostly cleared tung trees and switched to planting grain crops, greatly reducing tung oil production to about a quarter of pre-war levels.</p>
<p>After the victory, "Zhe Oil," which was once famous in the international market, showed little improvement. Although, in the early days of recovery, the general farmers believed that the good times for tung oil were about to return, and some replanted tung trees, the price of tung oil remained stagnant, and the farmers' interest in planting tung trees gradually waned again, and the future of "Zhe Oil" became increasingly bleak. The reasons for this, in addition to the fact that the price of tung oil fell compared to other commodities, also include: (1) Tung oil areas that had fallen into enemy hands during the war suffered severe logging and losses, making recovery difficult. (2) Domestic warfare continued for years, and tung trees grew more slowly than other crops, reducing farmers' interest in planting. (3) Diseases and insect pests of tung trees were rampant. (4) Tung farmers all used indigenous methods to make oil, resulting in impure oil quality and making it difficult to export. (5) Both tung farmers and oil merchants felt that they lacked funds and could not carry out large-scale production and sales.</p>
<p>Not long ago, this reporter visited several major tung oil-producing counties in eastern Zhejiang, such as Lanxi, Chun'an, Qu County, Jiangshan, and Jiande. These products have not been able to restore their pre-war glory, and production is also struggling to recover. Farmers mostly use outdated production methods, the lowest quality land, and ancient tools to complete the planting of tung trees and the production of tung oil.</p>
<p>In the eastern Zhejiang area, usually after the Frost's Descent, farmers begin to transport tung seeds to nearby oil pressing workshops, exchanging a small amount of tung seeds for tung oil or oil cake. Sometimes they also directly sell them to workshops or other small oil merchants at a discount.</p>
<p>Oil pressing workshops are mostly small in scale, using wooden presses for oil extraction, with simple structures and limited production. The workshops collect small amounts of tung seeds, accumulating enough to process, and then go through the following five steps to become "crude oil."</p>
<p>(1) Cleaning the Seeds: The tung seeds received by the workshops often contain dirt and other debris. Manual sorting is often used, or wind power is used to winnow away the dirt and debris.</p>
<p>(2) Drying the Seeds: Workshops mostly use brick-built pits as stoves, covering them with bamboo curtains to dry the tung seeds. The tung seeds are stacked on the bamboo curtains to a height of about five inches, and roasted over a slow fire, with constant turning to prevent the seeds from burning. The size and number of pits depend on the size of the workshop. However, each pit is mostly tended by one worker, and the size of the fire, the number of turns, and the roasting time are all determined by the worker's experience. Usually, it takes one and a half to two days to roast. After roasting, the seeds are sifted to remove broken and burnt husks.</p>
<p>(3) Crushing: The dried tung seeds are poured into a circular stone trough, two to three piculs at a time, and crushed by a large stone wheel pulled by an ox. If the amount of tung seeds is small, they may also be crushed by hand in a stone mortar.</p>
<p>(4) Steaming: The crushed tung seeds are placed in a steamer for ten minutes to soften them and make them easier to stick together to form a cake. Then, four iron rings are stacked on a cake board to form a cylindrical shape. The bottom and inside of the cylinder are covered with bundles of straw, with one end exposed outside the ring. The steamed tung seed powder is poured onto the straw, and the cake maker stands on the hot powder, using his feet to press it down, and using his feet to tread the straw around the iron ring to tightly wrap it around the cake.</p>
<p>(5) Oil Extraction: When entering the press, the iron rings on both sides of the cake are removed, and then the cake trees are placed in the press chamber, ten to fifteen at a time. Then, manpower is used to hold the ram and inject water into the press cavity, squeezing the oil cake horizontally to compress it tightly and slowly release the oil.</p>
<p>The workshops place the pressed tung oil separately into oil baskets and transport it to distribution and transshipment centers such as Lanxi, Quzhou, and Wenzhou, where merchants transport it to Shanghai for sale.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the tung trees planted in the eastern Zhejiang area are mostly two-year tung trees, and the natural conditions, such as climate and soil, are suitable for tung planting. The tung oil produced is light in color and of excellent quality. As long as the rebellion is quelled and foreign sales are smooth, it is foreseeable that "Zhe Oil" will continue to dominate the international market.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Guizhou Provincial Geological Survey Institute to Conduct Mineral Deposit Survey in Two Phases, Focusing on the Southeastern Region <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Guiyang] [Daily Aviation News] In order to develop the province's mining industry, the Guizhou Provincial authorities are now planning to start exploring underground resources to promote economic construction and pioneer the discovery of hidden resources. According to the Guizhou Provincial Geological Survey Institute, the province is extremely rich in underground resources. During the Anti-Japanese War, the aluminum mine in Xiuwen County was discovered, with the best quality in the country. The iron ore in Guanyin Mountain, Shuicheng, has the largest reserves, unmatched by other provinces in the southwest. There are countless other valuable mineral products. However, it is regrettable that they cannot be developed at once due to limited manpower and financial resources. As for the institute's recent survey and exploration work, it has not been fully launched due to economic constraints. In recent years, it has only conducted partial surveys of some virgin areas. The future plan is to complete a preliminary and systematic survey of the province's geological and mineral resources this year, focusing on the southeastern region of the province. According to the institute's recent discoveries, there are gold, iron, zinc, antimony, mercury, coal, saltpeter, clay, pyrite, and other minerals in the six counties of Rongjiang, Liping, Jinping, Sandu, Jianhe, and Congjiang, with abundant reserves and a very wide area. Among them, the most noteworthy are antimony in Rongjiang, asbestos and magnetite in Congjiang, which are extremely precious. Moreover, the area bordering Guangxi has a wide distribution of igneous and metamorphic rocks, which may contain "atomic energy" minerals. The institute has recently scheduled to conduct detailed surveys in two phases this year, and it is expected to complete the survey work in Congjiang, Rongjiang, and Sandu counties within March and April. The lower phase will survey Liping, Jianhe, and other places in September and October. The total survey cost has been budgeted at 59,200 gold yuan, which will be allocated from the province's construction special funds to start work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Spit Out What You Swallowed, the Technology of Deposit and Exchange is Not Thorough, A Gold Rush is Sweeping Across Ningxia, Ma Hongkui is Making the People Suffer <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Ping Liang</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Ningxia on the 1st] The Central Bank of Ningxia handles the deposit and exchange of gold. Because transportation is inconvenient, gold must be transferred from Lanzhou to Ningxia, so it only started on December 9th, 13 days later than the scheduled start date. According to the bank's announcement, the first batch of gold delivered was over 190 taels. However, due to incomplete procedures, the gold was completely exhausted within a few days of arrival, and the general public could not exchange it. As a result, the Central Bank's deposit and exchange of gold aroused suspicion in public opinion. The crowd was angry, shouted injustice, and set off a gold rush.</p>
<p>After Chairman Ma Hongkui learned about it, he made a painful statement, saying: "Since the issuance of the gold yuan, many patriots have taken out gold and silver to exchange for gold yuan, giving it warm support. Unfortunately, the country's fortune is not good. After a few days, the black market came suddenly, prices rose, and the social finance became more and more insecure. When the President returned to Beijing from the Northeast, he deeply regretted the losses suffered by the people who exchanged gold and silver. Embracing the idea of 'taking from the people and using for the people,' he allowed the people to deposit and exchange gold and silver. When the country heard the news, confidence in the gold yuan greatly increased. The Central Bank of our province has shipped more than 190 taels of gold this time. According to the procedures, it should have been announced in the newspaper first, and detailed deposit and exchange methods should be published. According to the situation, people who initially exchanged gold and silver for gold yuan should have priority in deposit and exchange. Unexpectedly, as soon as the gold arrived, they secretly kept it secret, the people in the bank exchanged it first, then they perfunctorily did it, and then the financial community exchanged it, and finally the sign was quietly hidden. When the people found out and asked, they said the gold was exchanged. What is this? The President's economic policy for the people was given priority to the bank staff to distribute the spoils. Is there anything more unfair in the world than this? It is regrettable! I (Ma referred to himself) saw that no one could deposit and exchange, so I sent someone to the Central Bank to inquire who had exchanged it? The bank said that no one could see the account without the order of the head office, and it seemed that outsiders suspected that the bank had malpractices, and it was not without reason."</p>
<p>Chairman Ma continued to criticize the bank's bureaucratic work, saying: "The country's financial fluctuations are like this, and the people's confidence in the gold yuan is not strong. However, the bank, which is responsible for stabilizing finance, is profiteering. It's really outrageous! At the same time, it is incomprehensible that local agencies always can't get the remittance notice from the central agencies for eight or ten days. When asked, the Central Bank says that they have not received it. May I ask if the notice from the local agencies can be received, but the notice from the Central Bank cannot be received. What is the reason? And every time it's late, is there no one time it's early? Furthermore, the receiving agencies always say that the money remitted by local agencies to Beijing and Shanghai can only be withdrawn after eight or ten days, which is really incomprehensible. Some people say that the bank delays the payment of the remittance to people to earn daily interest. I (Ma refers to himself) didn't believe it very much before, but now it seems that it is difficult to say!"</p>
<p>Finally, Chairman Ma said with great emotion: "The President is working hard for the country and the people, but as soon as the order is issued, the implementing agencies, the middle-level staff, give discounts at every level, and the order is completely changed. This is not just a phenomenon unique to the deposit and exchange of gold. Thinking of this, I can't help but complain for the people!"</p>
<p>Then, as a result of inquiries from relevant parties to the Central Bank, the Central Bank produced a registration form for the exchange of gold, on which the names and addresses of the depositors were checked and found to be mostly non-existent, so that the general public identified that the Central Bank had the suspicion of making up names for fraud. However, Manager Cheng Jiapeng of the bank had another explanation for the reporter. He said: "According to the original order of the head office, the deposit and exchange of gold started on November 26, but at that time the gold had not arrived, so we temporarily handled the registration procedures. After the depositors paid the money, they were given a slip, and they could take the gold when the gold was shipped. On the 26th, the announcement sign for the deposit and exchange of gold was posted, but no one asked about it all day. This bank was afraid that the head office would think that the postponement was Zhu Ban, and in order to promote it, I (Cheng Jiapeng referred to himself) and Feng Zhiwu, the chief of the business department, each deposited and exchanged five qian. As for the deposit and exchange procedures, the head office did not give detailed and standard, such as who should exchange, or what kind of registration procedures should be stipulated. Therefore, it was very chaotic when it was opened, and anyone could deposit and exchange. In order to be cautious, we also stipulated a kind of registration form, so that each depositor could fill it out by himself, and there was no guarantee. However, after the fact, the registered names and addresses were mostly fabricated. This was really a point that this bank could not prevent at that time, and it did not consider it at all.</p>
<p>At this point, Manager Cheng said: "Please spit out what you swallowed!" The 46 taels of gold deposited and exchanged by the banks in the city have all been returned and temporarily stored in the Central Bank. If there is an order, other depositors with a basis can also be recovered, but the list of unclaimed names is now being investigated as much as possible.</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly investigate who are the people who fabricated names for deposit and exchange, and to quell public anger, the authorities specially ordered the military law office to step up the investigation. Now it has not yet reached the stage where the truth is revealed, but someone has revealed clues, and the mystery will definitely be revealed soon.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Abundant Arrivals from All Sides, Rice Market Weakened, Flour Soared, Grain and Oil Prices Rose <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The rice market opened red yesterday, but the price declined slightly, because the weather was sunny and the arrival of goods was very strong. The price of rice in the production area was slightly lower during the holiday, so the price quoted by the cargo owner was also low. The initial opening decreased by 40 to 50 yuan. The rice shops in the central city turned smoothly, and the price slightly increased, but the closing price was still 30 to 40 yuan lower than last year. The white japonica rice in the south city was 630 yuan, a decrease of 30 yuan. Early rice fell by 25 yuan, and the sales of light white yuan were still active, slightly lower by 10 yuan. The white japonica rice in the north city opened at 630 yuan, a decrease of 25 yuan, and early thin rice and Yangxian rice each fell by more than 20 yuan. A total of 19,384 shi arrived in the north and south cities yesterday.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Soared very vigorously. Cargo owners said that the interest rate for three days during the holiday was very high, and they all raised prices. In addition, there was very little stock in the store, and there was a lot of replenishment on the market, so the rise was fierce. The old car opened at 315 yuan, and rose straight to 337 yuan at the close, a surge of 65 yuan compared with last year. The retail sales of the warship flour were strong, and the closing price was 335 yuan, a surge of 72 yuan. The red bee, Tongcheng, and miscellaneous brand flours all went out of 300, and the large bag of bran rose by nearly 40 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Rose very greatly. Due to the patronage of the customers, the sales were very smooth, and the prices rose in unison. The initial opening of soybeans was relatively flat, but after the customers were involved, they finally saw a price increase of 100 yuan. The northern gang strongly absorbed corn, and the rise was very fierce. Chongming corn was 630 yuan, a surge of about 40%. The opening of red grain was not much, and the price rose by 70 yuan. Mung beans also rose sharply, and the flour mills were active, rising by about 50 to 60 yuan. Sesame rose by 130 to 140 yuan, and peanuts were taken by the Guanggang, rising by 200 to 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The rise was fierce. At the initial opening, the cargo owners added a lot of interest for the three days of the holiday, so they raised prices very vigorously. Later, due to the strong sales in the street, the rise became more and more fierce. Soybean oil opened at 2,600 yuan, the highest was 2,900 yuan, and the closing price was 2,800 yuan, a rise of 700 yuan compared with last year, reaching more than 30%. Raw vegetable oil was as high as 2,700 yuan, and closed at 2,600 yuan, also a rise of 700 yuan. Jitou Sheng oil closed at 2,900 yuan. Soybean cake followed the rise of about 40 yuan.</p>
<p>Imported Rice Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Merchants Bureau's Hai Xuan Wheel brought 6,147 tons of imported rice from Yangon and Bangkok, arriving in Shanghai yesterday and berthing at Zhongzhan for unloading. The rice from Yangon was more than 3,900 tons, which was US aid, and the rice from Bangkok was more than 2,100 tons, which was purchased by the China Trust Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Last Year's Export Settlement Reached 170 Million US Dollars <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>According to the Export Control Commission, the amount of foreign exchange settlement in Shanghai last year was as follows: January, 9,398,000 US dollars; February, 8,687,000 US dollars; March, 9,230,000 US dollars; April, 8,018,000 US dollars; May, 12,593,000 US dollars; June, 15,011,000 US dollars; July, 14,933,000 US dollars; August, 17,205,000 US dollars; September, 17,224,000 US dollars; October, 14,892,000 US dollars; November, 20,029,000 US dollars; and December, preliminary statistics of 24,990,000 US dollars, totaling 173,210,000 US dollars. Among them, April was the lowest and December was the highest. Looking at the whole year, the situation of export settlement began to improve from June, because the export settlement certificate has been implemented, which is beneficial to exports. However, it declined again in October, because after the currency change, the price of domestic export materials rose, and the exchange rate of gold yuan against foreign exchange became too high, so export settlement shrank. In November and December, due to the implementation of the Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate, exports were greatly stimulated, and the amount of foreign exchange settlement was more than 20 million US dollars, breaking the previous record. It is generally expected that if peace is realized this year and transportation is smooth, the export situation in Shanghai will be more optimistic.</p>

<p>According to the Silver and Money Association, the implementation measures for silver and money firms to pay deposit guarantee reserves have been approved by the Ministry of Finance, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The reserve that should be paid for the ordinary deposits and savings deposits received by firms and villages should be uniformly renamed "guarantee reserve" in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Law.</p>
<p>(2) The ratio of deposit guarantee reserves for commercial banks and savings banks in various places is temporarily set at 15% for current deposits and 10% for time deposits.</p>
<p>(3) The ratio of deposit guarantee reserves for industrial banks should be verified after adjusting business in accordance with the law and determining the nature. At present, they will be temporarily paid according to the above standards of commercial banks.</p>
<p>(4) The ratio of deposit guarantee reserves paid by provincial, county, and municipal banks shall be temporarily handled in accordance with the provisions of industrial banks in the Banking Law, and the ratio shall be temporarily set at 12% for current deposits and 8% for time deposits.</p>
<p>(5) Silver and money firms pay deposit guarantee reserves in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Law to offset them with public debt treasury bonds. Various banks in various places may be allocated public debt treasury bonds to offset the payment, and the amount is not limited. As for the valuation of bonds, national currency bonds shall be calculated at 70% of the face value. Foreign currency bonds shall be calculated at 50% of the publicly announced foreign exchange market price on the date of payment or adjustment.</p>
<p>(6) The adjustment of guarantee reserves shall still be done once a month as usual. The guarantee reserve for previous savings deposits was adjusted once every three months and should be changed to once a month.</p>

<p>The opening price of woolen fabrics in the market yesterday was mostly the same as the closing price of last year. Except for overcoats, the prices of all other woolen fabrics remained high. Double cat Biji was quoted at 600 yuan, China Textile at 525 yuan, mixed-color tweed at 650 yuan to 850 yuan, piece-dyed tweed at 450 yuan to 600 yuan, riding breeches Tweeds at 600 yuan to 850 yuan, long-pile velvet at 700 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and navy blue at 425 yuan. The sales in the market were sluggish, and the transaction turned silent. It is said that the average price of each commodity soared by two and a half times in the week from the 22nd to the 28th of last month, and the public's purchasing power has been greatly weakened.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Survey of the Enamel Industry by the Municipal Industrial Technology Association <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Industrial Association Technical Committee, there are 18 enamel factories in the city, with a total of 2,091 workers. There are 35 enamel kilns in operation, 13 powder kilns, and 4 rotary kilns. Among them, Huafeng and Yifeng are the largest, each with 5 enamel kilns in operation, but Huafeng's equipment is newer. The next is Yisheng Factory, with 3 kilns in operation, and Zhonghua, Jiuxin, Zhufeng, Taifeng, Jinlong, Jinxing, Xinhua, and Shunfeng Factories each have 2 kilns in operation. The next are Weida, Minfeng, China Guangda, Huaye, Huacheng, Lixing, and Hongfu Factories, each with one kiln in operation. Lixing was established last year, and Hongfu started operation at the beginning of this year. China Guangda Factory is currently merging the equipment of Jiufeng Factory, and its production will double in the future. The monthly output of each factory, if calculated in terms of enamel washbasins, spittoons, various plates, pots, bowls, cups, etc., is about 500,000 to 600,000 pieces. Enamel plates are 70,000 square feet. The monthly requirement is 620 tons of 28 to 3030 iron sheets, 45 tons of Chilean nitrate, 55 tons of soda ash, 130 tons of borax, 400 tons of quartz powder, feldspar powder, fluorite powder, and cryolite powder, 730 tons of diesel oil, of which more than 70% are imported raw materials. Recently, due to the weak purchasing power in Shanghai, poor freight transport in North China and the Yangtze River, and the fact that the foreign exchange rate in various parts of Southeast Asia is less than eight times higher than the "8.19" base price, while the cost has risen more than ten times, making it almost impossible to sell abroad. Therefore, all factories have difficulty selling goods and have to reduce factory stocks. The recent wholesale price is ten times the "8.19" base price, while wages and raw materials have risen to more than fifteen times.</p>

<p>According to the Central Trust Bureau, the total amount of debt owed by the bureau on behalf of the country for barter trade with Japan has reached 8 million US dollars. The origin of this debt is not due to poor management or unequal exchange. After the victory, the machinery and equipment needed by our country were all ordered through a single order from the Allied Command and delivered on schedule. During this period, most of the materials in our country that had value and could be exchanged for more foreign exchange were transported to other countries, and there were very few exports to Japan. Even if there were exports, most of them were materials that could not be exchanged for foreign exchange in other countries. Therefore, the result was inevitable debt. However, this kind of debt can be repaid immediately.</p>

In the first game, Tung Wah turned defeat into victory with a score of 48 to 45, defeating the US Army. At halftime, Tung Wah had 20 points and the Weather Team had 25. In the second game, originally it was supposed to be Jianqiao Air Force Academy against Macklin's team, but Macklin's team was called away on short notice and unable to participate, so the West Youth team took their place. This team was a mix-and-match group, with General Keliberte commanding everything. The first half ended in a 15-15 tie. The Air Force Academy gradually got into their stride in the second half, taking off in a big way and winning with a score of 51 to 32.</p>
<p>The Air Force Academy's visit to Shanghai resulted in four wins and one loss. The victory over Hua Lian on New Year's Day was particularly glorious, and the team's strength was truly astonishing. The details of yesterday's games are as follows:</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Winter Relief football charity match between China United and West United was held at Yiyuan Stadium on the afternoon of the 3rd at 2:30 PM. There were more than ten thousand spectators and philanthropists, making it a grand occasion. The ticket revenue from ticket sales totaled over 188,000 yuan. Mayor Wu attended the opening ceremony and kicked off the game. Deputy Director Wang Zhaohuai of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau presided over the auction of the charity ball. The Shanghai Electric Combination provided live broadcast of the match, and the atmosphere at the stadium was quite enthusiastic. As a result of the competition, West United narrowly defeated China United 3-2. West United led 1-0 in the first half. The lineups of the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>West United</p>
<p>Xuede Guofu, Xu Erzizi, Karolier District, Griffis, Tievoni, A. Oliveira, Panlai, Borgni, Gelinasi, Roberts Stoff down, Gebi up, Kola up, Toshi down, Lai up</p>
<p>China United</p>
<p>Xu Fusheng, Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang, Xue Peiran, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Jin Lusheng, Luo Shoufu, Qu Yongfu, Gao Xiuqing, Chen Le down, Lin Dianyi up</p>
<p>Auction of Charity Ball</p>
<p>During the break, Deputy Director Wang Zhaohuai presided over the auction of the charity ball, starting from 100 gold yuan. After fierce competition, the "old fan" Cheng Bo'an finally won the bid with the highest price of 50,000 yuan. Cheng Bo'an then donated it again, and it was re-auctioned. Finally, a Mr. Dong bought it for 50,000 yuan in the name of an anonymous person, to relieve the refugees. His sincerity is admirable.</p>
<p>China United's Defeat</p>
<p>It was freezing cold. This charity match, which was supposed to be a highlight of the season, was not very exciting. China United never showed good teamwork. Especially the weakness of right winger Lin Dianyi, lost many opportunities, and the ball stopped every time it reached him. Gao Xiuqing was short, and the strength of the right wing was greatly weakened. The left wing, Jin Lusheng, did not get the ball much. Xiao Luo was the most outstanding, and his several sprints were very impressive. Center back Gao Baozheng was the strongest. The West United's fullbacks and center backs were very good, and the right winger Panlai was especially likeable. China United's loss was due to the penalty kick in the first place. The second goal in the second half bounced off the post and went in, which could not be helped. The third goal was because the center back was too far forward, and the fullbacks could not save it. In the second half, China United launched a fierce counterattack, but could not score. They knew the game was over.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick</p>
<p>The game started at 2:35 PM. The referee was He Shouheng, and the linesmen were Chen Jiqun and Hui Bo. Mayor Wu entered the stadium and shook hands with the players of the Chinese and Western teams respectively, and then kicked the ball, kicking off the battle. West United got the ball from Mayor Wu and was about to attack, but China United caught up. However, the right winger Lin Dianyi was too weak and repeatedly lost good opportunities. At nine minutes, West United forward Gebi was injured and left the field. Just then, "Little Blondie" Roberts Stoff arrived and substituted, increasing the attack. At 29 minutes, Yan Shixin prevented Little Blondie from attacking and caused trouble in the penalty area. He was sentenced to a penalty kick, which was successfully taken by Gelinasi. West United then took a 1-0 lead in the first half.</p>
<p>One Goal Defeated</p>
<p>Changing sides and fighting again, China United sent Chen Qin into the field, replacing Lin Dianyi. West United, Shan Toshi entered the field replacing A. Oliveira. West United passed the ball for offense. After ten minutes of melee, Santo received a cross from Roberts Stoff and shot close to the goal, hitting the goal post and bouncing in, 2-0. China United counterattacked, and in less than a minute, Qu Yongfu lived up to expectations and pulled back a goal with a beautiful pose. However, at 25 minutes, Roberts Stoff dribbled past Wu Qixiang and shot close to the goal. Xu Fusheng caught the ball and lost it again, rolling into the net, 3-1, West United won another city. At 31 minutes, Gao Xiuqing received a pass from Chen Qin and rushed into the net with the ball. Until the end of the time, West United narrowly defeated China United 3-2.</p>

<p>Zhang Sheng asks: My late father had three brothers, who had already separated their residences, but the ancestral property has not yet been distributed. When they separated, they made three written agreements, each holding one. Later, my father passed away in 1934. At that time, I was young, and the agreement was kept by my older sister. In 1935, my older sister went abroad due to some matters, which caused the agreement to be lost. I also joined the Air Force in 1936. Later, I moved west with the army, and only returned to Shanghai last year. In the past fifteen years, I have not returned to my hometown due to studying in Shanghai and serving with the army. Now I intend to return to my hometown to propose the distribution of property. I do not know what procedures should be followed. If my family raises objections, how should I deal with it? If this property has been sold by my family, what procedures should be followed to recover it? Is there any legal basis for the above situations? Please give a detailed answer.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan Answers] Since the written agreement at the time of separation has been lost, you should first inquire with your uncles and investigate whether the property rights have been transferred to the local county government or land administration agency before claiming the analysis and suing procedures.</p>
