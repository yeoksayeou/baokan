<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕國民黨中政會十七日晨舉行例會，對和平問題詳予討論，經三小時之研究，並未獲得決定性之結論，決將本日會中所提各項意見整理後，于廿日再舉行臨時中政會予以討論，作最後之決定。本日會議由孫科主持，兼外長吳鐵城國防部長徐永昌先後分別報告外交。軍事。繼由孫科就和平問題提請討論，旋由中宣部長黃少谷報告毛澤東之時局聲明，並詳述中共八條和談條件，各委員當卽紛紛發言，就此廣泛交換意見，經歸納爲下列數端：（一）中共旣有此類似答覆之聲明，自有和談之希望，吾人希望中共能以事實表現，卽首先停戰，然後開始和談。（二）一部份人士主張，進一步促港和談之迅速實現，雙方立即推派代表，作初步洽商，俾使此業已打開之和平之門，得獲進一步之行動。關于推派代表一點，有人堅主即推請張治中飛延安共區洽談，有人主張雙方先推定代表，再研究協商之步驟及地點，對此點發言者較多。（三）反對和平運動之展開，此點意見乃基於毛澤東之聲明顯無誠意，和平無法進行。今日國民黨內人士意見，均能充分表現，彼等對廿日之會議，希望蔣兼總裁能親自主持，俾迅速有所決定。今日之會議，張治中·張羣·邵力子·吳鐵城等均出席。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕民社黨領袖張君勱，十七日竟日分與各方接觸，晚八時復應總統召宴，由張羣陪同前往黃埔路官邸餐後曾作詳談，張氏當就該黨對當前時局之意見提出向總統申述，並與總統共硏當前應行之途徑與步驟。茲悉：孫科所提之建議中，特別指出希望總統就其個人之進退出處能作進一步之指示，其次為憲法問題，在憲法上若干不合理或有問題之條文，予以修改刪除，使其能為完滿之憲法，再次為保障人民生存基本權利。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十七日電〕蔣總統聞已決定對中共之媾和條件草擬對案。此種決定化學昨夜在總弘官邸各要人非正式宴會中決定，但可靠人士稱：數日內不致有何舉行。宴會席上談到共方苛刻之和平條件時，蔣氏沉默，面有不愉之色。張君勱與左舜生堅持必須加以答復，以示政府謀和誠意。蔣氏及其他人士加以默認，並擬先行試探各黨及人民之意見。</p>

<h3 id="c3">雷震對和談觀感　必須先做到雙方停戰不可忽略應有的準備 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社甫京十七日電〕中央社記者，頃以中共所提和平條件暨一般人所謂和平之門已開等問題，特徵詢前政治協商會議秘書長雷震觀感。雷氏稱：和平是大家所期待的，本人尤其希望和平。惟照十四日中共首領聲明的八項條件看來，我個人却不敢輕易相信中共已具有和平誠意。也許有人認爲這八項條件只是「雙方從事和平談判的基礎」，其間不無可以斟酌損益之處。我們姑捨此不談，但另有更重要的一點，大家應該確認，卽和談的先決條件，必須有一個適於和談的實際環境和氣氛，具體的說，必須先做到雙方停戰。就這一點，目前的事實擺得很明顯，一方面政府的軍事行動，自總統文告發表以後，各處都以應戰的姿態採取守勢，、另方面共軍則到處進行劇烈的進攻，平津方面爲尤著，在這種局勢下，和談如何談起。回憶卅五年一月，召開政治協商會議時，曾以雙方停戰爲先決條件之一，尤以中共方面特別强調，必須無條件停戰，始能開會，但當時僅局部衝突，與今日大規模之戰爭，實不能相比。本人躬與其事，記憶尤新，現在中共的作法是一方面提出荒謬的所謂和平條件，同時在其廣播中肆意誣蔑，幷在其末段中，指示其指揮官和戰鬥員，繼續戰鬥，直至政府接受，幷實現其所謂和平條件爲止。在這種情形下，如果我們認爲和平之門已因中共的反應而打開，不是自欺，卽是幻想。雷氏最後稱：和平是政府所希求的，但我們必須得到對方有和平誠意的保證，無條件立卽現地停戰，同時我們自己也要不亂步驟，團結一致，始有談和的可能，如果僅在中共這個反應之下，積極去求和，恐怕只是走向投降之路而己。因此，我們不要終日專注意談和，而忽略自己應有的準備，因爲我們必須具有談和的力量，始能談和，所謂能戰始能和也。</p>

<p>〔本報長沙十七日電〕湘省府十七日晨九時舉行擴大月會，程主席報告：（一）認共黨八條件故意强人所難，以遂其不願和平之目的，今日問題不是大家願和不和，而是共黨不願和，希望大家鎮定心志，判斷是非，去取決和平的途徑。（二）要一心一德，發揮各人力量，不要想入非非，卽使和平成功，也受人支配。（三）金融波動，大家都苦，但此係整僩時局如此，大家要刻苦耐勞，「窮且益堅」，以渡過難關。最後程氏對共黨廣播渠係戰犯之一，認此不會使渠屈服，渠一定要使湖南三千萬人民得着安定後，才算盡了職守，而放棄責任。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕平東城居民今晨三時許多為轟然巨響二聲所震醒，黎明後探悉係何思源寓　二彈，何氏之二小姐徵妹（十六歲）被炸死，其法籍夫人何宜文及大小姐亦中碎片輕傷。記者上午赴錫拉胡同九號何寓訪問時，何氏已送妻女赴協和醫院，僅二小姐徵妹之屍體尚覆被停於會客應床上。據何寓工役稱，今晨三時零四分，何夫人臥室着彈，二小姐獨睡一床，當被炸死，睡於另一床之何夫人及大小姐亦被震仆地，面部身上受輕傷，旋緊鄭之何氏臥室亦著彈。記者視察時，見何臥房頂炸穿一六七尺直徑之大洞，室內傢具衣物被磚瓦塵土所壓，凌亂不堪，院內玻璃亦被震碎。</p>

<p>〔太報南京十七日電〕權威人士十七日語記者，政府關於國際調處謀求和平之努力，現已告一段落，然在國內局勢演變一成定局時，或可有新發展。該人士稱，渠不知蘇·美·英·法是否已對我國之備忘錄提出正式覆文，亦不知四國是否有必要提出正式覆文，拒絕參與調處之邀請。渠所能言者，卽週來政府外交活動接觸之結果，已獲得四國使節之初步口頭答覆，各國對我國備忘錄及我國局勢加以考慮後，均認在目前尚少參與調處之機會。另據記者獲悉，吳兼外長十七日晨於國民黨中政會議席上，對有關和平之外交活動，未作報告，僅稱，留待以後再說。又官方仍拒絕證實或否認四國已對我政府備忘錄提出正式覆文之傳說。</p>

<p>〔中央社北平十七日電〕華北人民和平促進會，十六日爲呼籲和平，特分電蔣總統及毛澤東，痛陳所見，要求雙方停戰，早日協商和平。茲誌原電如次：　南京蔣總統鈞鑒，延安毛澤東先生勛鑒：我中華民族苦於戰禍者久矣。溯自民國肇造，內戰無一日或停，蘆溝難發，抗戰亘八年始息，在此悠長之歲月中，人民塗炭，國土支離，慘苦情形，曠古未有。當抗戰勝利之始，方慶人民得以蘇息，和平得以實現；不料政治協商中途破裂，軍事調處未竟全功，遂至戰火蔓延，漸及全國，慘禍所至，老弱轉乎溝壑，少壯死於砲火，廬舍爲墟，田園荒蕪，此種慘况，凡身受目睹者莫不痛心疾首，深惡痛絕，想亦爲公等所洞鑒。竊以不論戡亂或解放，其最終目的均在救民於水火，然兵戎所及，爭城以戰，殺入盈城，爭地以戰，殺人盈野，若長此不已，則人民之遭遇將如水益深，如火益熱，等於窮兵黷武，殘民以逞矣。夫政黨之不論在朝在野者，因思想信仰之不同，而發生政爭，各國都有，但不能以武力爲政爭之工具，否則救民者反而害民，建國者反而禍國，其結果必將爲人民所共棄。我蔣總統洞鑒幾先，發佈文告，已大開和平之門，毛先生鑒於大義當前，亦已表示和平誠意况國共雙方均以民主爲號召，不論其思想信仰若何，民之所好者好之，民之所恶劣者惡之，爲政爭成功之要諦，亦卽民主政治之眞義。方今人民苦于戰禍，所好者為和平，所惡者為戰爭，而所謂和平者在轉念之間即可實現，所謂戰爭者在互讓之中即可避免。我蔣總統即已決心實現和平，甚且不以個人之進退縈懷，此光明磊落之胸襟，當爲國人所共諒，亦爲國人所期待；毛先生卽以民主主義爲號召，對全國人民所期待之和平，亦必犧牲自我之見地，而樂於接受，民心向背，只在轉念之间，千秋功罪，唯在和戰之擇。我華北各界人民，願於此痛陳所見，以待國共雙方採擇，並盼各有更進一步之表示，先行下令停戰，俾得早日協商和平，解民倒县，則國家幸甚，人民辛甚。</p>

<p>〔本市訊〕經合分署訊，華盛頓經合總署頃宣佈：由於華北主要口岸大估口目前不復能供卸貨之用，該署正進行調整麵粉及小麥之運華程序，根據此項新程序，所有待運之麵粉，將暫時停止裝載，而在來華途中之船隻，亦將改變目的地。經合署經常按月供應配售用之麵粉三萬六千噸，其中二萬八千噸或全部之四分之三，係運往平津兩市，但自去年十二月廿四日後，軍事行動阻止經合署之美援小麥及麵粉運往華北城市，該署乃將此項麵粉改運迤南之各港口，所有改道食糧，儘量運往靑島，達四萬噸之多，以致該地倉儲充塞，無法再容，其餘原擬運往華北之食糧乃改運上海，故兩地之食糧存儲數，已遠超正常情形，因此經合總署認爲適合目前之消費量起見，有調整運輸程序之必要。</p>

<h3 id="c19">平心靜氣論和談 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>自中共毛澤東氏廣播了和談基礎八條件以後，朝野人士，議論紛紜。昨晚消息：國民黨中政會昨天討論，雖有若干辯難，但除「懲辦戰犯」一條引起全體反對外，其餘認爲尚可討論。即此，可見國民黨的中樞當局並沒有什麼張脈僨興的憤氣。我們自然更不希望一綫曙光重歸黯淡，深願平心靜氣，再爲雙方一論和談重開之必要。</p>
<p>第一，雙方必須認議眞要和平者是人民，尤其是平民大衆。故雙方當局心目中，果眞有所謂「人民」在，就當拋棄「我」見，設身處地爲人民着想。在幾年的戰亂中，成千成萬死傷的是人民，傾家蕩產的是人民，流離失所飢寒交迫的是人民。人民何辜，遭此荼毒？雙方果眞尚有天良，此時應該暫且一切不談，先行同時下令停戰；這纔是毛澤東氏所謂「迅速結束戰爭，减輕人民痛苦」的切要辦法。任何條件，等到停了戰，好好的談，開誠布公的談。這樣，才是有大慈大悲的菩薩心腸，才是有爲國爲民的英雄氣概。須知相打的兩人，必先大家停了手，然後可以交談，這是常識！字林西報昨天社評，以爲任何方面若堅持自己主張，則難逃日後歷史家的惡評，不知雙方是否有偉大人物能把握此一機會；我們亦有同感。把握此一和平機會的方鈇，首先在於立即停戰。假使中共一面晚願意「迅速結束戰爭」，一面加緊進攻，好像要以戰勝者的姿態，實行毛澤東氏所謂「對於反動派必須堅決澈底乾凈全部地殲滅之」的計劃，那麼是否有和平誠意，不能令人無疑了。</p>
<p>第二，再就條件而論，我們以爲都該是停戰以後的事。條件內容，雙方所已揭布者，五項原則與八點基礎，互有出入，原無足怪。所可怪者却有了一個「懲辦戰犯」的新鮮名詞。中國人向來講「中道」的，不偏不倚，最是可貴。故中國歷史上，就是改朝換代，全勝的一方也沒有這樣「懲辦戰犯」的苛刻辦鈇，而况中共今天究竟還未必握有一個全勝之局。並且，講到戰犯，無非要課以戰爭責任之意，那麼道幾年破壤政協，重見干戈的實際責任，究竟由那方擔負，只能憑人民來公斷，決非中共所可完全加之於政府者，而人民則但求戰事速了，並不要再事苛求戰爭的責任。尤可笑的是：中共一方面將政府負責人全都視爲「戰犯」，一方間又說願與「反動政府」談和，天下事之矛盾滑稽，當亦無過於此。試問：在「懲辦戰犯」的基礎條件之下，現政府中誰還有資格和中共談判呢？</p>
<p>第三，變方所提的其他條件，我們以爲最好此時都不堅持，讓停戰以後大家作平心靜氣的商討，而取決於人民的公意。憲鈇雖是國民大會所制定，究竟並不是一成不變的東西，果有更好意見，何坊從長計議，加以修改？法統最要緊的當是國體與政制，國體斷不可改，政制則未始不可以因時制宜。整編軍隊，在戰後是當然的工作，而最主要的還是任何軍隊的絕對國家化。至於沒收官僚資本，和改革土地制度，如作爲口號標語，絕對漂亮，此種論調在國民黨中也早已高唱入雲，則今後只須明定界限，釐訂辦法，遂一實施，當無多大阻礙。所謂「賣國條約」，如果確有其事，當然應予廢除，特不知中蘇友好同盟條約，割棄外蒙，斷送了東北許多權益，中共是否也主張廢除？召集政協會議組成民主聯合政府，本爲以前政協的原議，不過沒有「反動份子」參加的附帶條件究作何解，不能不問。倘指現政府負責人都是「戰犯」，「反動份子」，都不准參加，則不知政治協商究係和誰協商了。而最令吾人抱憾者，就是總統文告中所說「人民能够維持其自由生活方式與目前最低生活水準」這一點，最合人民的期望，恰恰爲毛澤東氏所澳視而並無一字一句的提及。我們以爲人民在停戰以後，將來所最注意的，倒並不是紙上的憲法，官吏的名單，而是人民自己怎樣生活，有否自由·雙方果眞爲國爲民，應都貫注全神於此。</p>
<p>最後，我們要苦勸作戰的雙方：戰爭太殘酷了！人民太痛苦了！國民黨數十年來的革命，原是爲救人民；共產黨也說要解放人民。現在人民已經環請雙方停戰議和了，雙方得罷休來且罷休！「放下屠刀，立地成佛！」請雙方當局閉目一思：有多少同胞的生命，正待決於諸公一念之中？佛教有所謂六度的鈇門，布施居其首，忍辱任其難。布施之極，有以生命爲布施者；忍辱之極，有被割截肢體而安然忍辱者。何以故？爲救衆生故？總統元且文告，謂只望和平果能實現，其他絕不縈懷，此已近於以名位爲布施的精神；而歷受中共「頭號戰犯」的侮辱，恬然不以爲忤，仍願研討其條件，則尤爲富於一忍辱」的精神。菩薩心腸，當之無愧。甚願中共領袖，亦能破除我執，毅然停戰，则和談立可開始，中國大局也就能豁然開朗了。中共究竟眞爲人民與否，願即以事實表現之！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨提名立委王者賓，曁劉雲閣二人，因有販賣雅片嫌疑，經地檢處偵查後，已於昨日提起公訴，茲探錄起訴書原文於後：</p>
<p>「三十七年七月十八日，上海江海關派員在龍華機塲檢查由平來滬一〇三號中航機旅客時，發覺被告王者賓携帶夾底皮箱兩只，內藏鴉片，計毛重十公斤半，被獲之際，該被告指該皮箱兩隻，爲正在機塲候接之劉雲閣所有，嗣由江海關將王·劉二名，連同雅片併交警察局解送本院刑庭，移請偵查到處。關於</p>
<p>王者賓</p>
<p>部份：王在警局供稱。皮箱兩隻，內藏雅片，爲其所携帶，經嚴訓後續稱：有素識之友人徐松九有一批烟土囑託帶滬交給劉雲閣，該雅片係裝在夾底皮箱兩隻內，爲避免檢查易於發現起見，故將衣服分裝兩箱上層以爲掩蔽，不料飛機抵滬，卽被破獲等語。迨本院刑庭及本處先後偵查時，被告意圖翻供，揑稱不知箱裏裝有雅片，第查該皮箱爲被告所携帶，底層裝有烟土，重達十公斤半，爲量並非不多，且其上層，置放衣服，又爲被告所不否認，顯有明知烟土在內，以衣掩蔽之故意，已難任憑飾詞狡賴，况徐松九有無其人，是否囑託携帶，亦乏佐證，該皮箱兩隻內藏雅片，爲被告所有，實無可疑。關於</p>
<p>劉雲閣</p>
<p>部份：查被告雖否認皮箱爲其所有，但於被告王者賓抵滬之時，卽赴機塲候接，無非意圖幫同趨避檢查，得達販賣目的，且又與王者賓同在北平久居一處，對於如何計劃販賣雅片，不無與王者賓犯意聯絡，及行爲分担之罪嫌，自非空言狡辯所能脫卸刑責。總上所述，被告等核其所爲，應犯禁烟禁毒治罪條例第五條第一項，刑法第廿八條之罪，惟查犯罪時間係在舊禁烟禁毒治罪條例施行期內，按刑法第二條第一項但書規定，應依同法第二百五十七條第一項論處，合依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條第一項，刑事訴訟法二百三十條第一項，提起公訴。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Kuomintang Central Political Committee Held Meeting Yesterday: Extensive Exchange of Views on Peace; Decided to Hold Another Provisional Meeting on the 20th for Final Decision; Sun Ke Proposed Amendments to Constitutional Articles <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Kuomintang Central Political Committee held a regular meeting on the morning of the 17th to discuss the peace issue in detail. After three hours of study, no decisive conclusion was reached. It was decided to organize the various opinions raised at today's meeting and hold another provisional Central Political Committee meeting on the 20th to discuss and make a final decision. Today's meeting was chaired by Sun Ke. Foreign Minister Wu Tiecheng and Defense Minister Xu Yongchang successively reported on diplomatic and military affairs. Sun Ke then raised the peace issue for discussion. Subsequently, Huang Shaogu, Minister of Propaganda, reported on Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation and elaborated on the eight peace negotiation conditions of the Chinese Communist Party. The committee members immediately spoke one after another, exchanging views extensively. The following points were summarized: (1) Since the CCP has made a statement similar to a reply, there is hope for peace talks. We hope that the CCP can demonstrate this with facts, that is, first cease fire and then begin peace talks. (2) Some people advocate further promoting the rapid realization of peace talks in Hong Kong, with both sides immediately sending representatives to conduct preliminary consultations, so that this already opened door to peace can obtain further action. Regarding the dispatch of representatives, some insisted that Zhang Zhizhong be immediately invited to fly to Yan'an Communist area for talks, while others advocated that the two sides first determine the representatives, and then study the steps and location of the consultation. More people spoke on this point. (3) Oppose the development of the peace movement. This view is based on the lack of sincerity in Mao Zedong's statement, making peace impossible. The opinions of Kuomintang figures today can fully express their hope that Chairman Chiang can personally chair the meeting on the 20th, so that a decision can be made quickly. Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng and others attended today's meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The President Convened a Banquet for Zhang Junmai to Discuss Current Courses of Action and Steps; Zhang Zhizhong Arranged to Meet with the Vice President <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, was in contact with various parties throughout the 17th. At 8 PM, he responded to the President's invitation for a banquet, accompanied by Zhang Qun to the official residence on Huangpu Road. After the meal, they had a detailed discussion. Zhang stated the party's views on the current situation to the President and jointly studied the current courses of action and steps. It is understood that Sun Ke's suggestions specifically pointed out the hope that the President could provide further instructions on his personal advancement and retreat. Secondly, regarding the constitutional issue, some unreasonable or problematic articles in the constitution should be amended or deleted to make it a complete constitution. Thirdly, to guarantee the basic rights of the people to survival.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] It is heard that President Chiang has decided to draft a counter-proposal to the CCP's peace terms. This decision was made at an informal banquet of key figures at the presidential residence last night, but reliable sources say that nothing will happen in the next few days. When the harsh peace conditions of the Communist side were mentioned at the banquet, Chiang remained silent, looking displeased. Zhang Junmai and Zuo Shunsheng insisted that a reply must be made to show the government's sincerity in seeking peace. Chiang and others silently agreed and planned to first probe the opinions of various parties and the people.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Premier Sun Ke invited key cabinet members and related personnel for dinner at the Premier's official residence No. 1 at 6 PM on the 17th, and continued to solicit opinions on the peace issue. It is heard that Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu and others attended, and the meeting dispersed at around 9 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, etc. have been working hard for peace all day. They are consulting with each other at any time. Zhang invited Vice President Li Zongren to lunch at his official residence on the 17th and had a meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Lei Zhen's Views on Peace Talks: We Must First Achieve a Ceasefire Between the Two Sides, and We Cannot Ignore the Necessary Preparations <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] A Central News Agency reporter recently asked Lei Zhen, former Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, for his views on the peace conditions proposed by the CCP and the so-called opening of the door to peace by the general public. Lei said: Peace is what everyone expects, and I especially hope for peace. However, looking at the eight conditions stated by the CCP leader on the 14th, I personally dare not easily believe that the CCP has peace sincerity. Some people may think that these eight conditions are only the "basis for peace negotiations between the two sides," and there is room for consideration and adjustment. Let's put this aside for now, but there is another more important point that everyone should confirm, that is, the prerequisite for peace talks must be a practical environment and atmosphere suitable for peace talks. Specifically, we must first achieve a ceasefire between the two sides. On this point, the current facts are very clear. On the one hand, the government's military actions, since the President's proclamation, have adopted a defensive posture everywhere in response to the war. On the other hand, the Communist army is conducting fierce offensives everywhere, especially in the Pingjin area. Under this situation, how can peace talks be possible? Recalling January 1946, when the Political Consultative Conference was convened, a ceasefire between the two sides was one of the prerequisites, especially emphasized by the CCP, that the meeting could only be held if there was an unconditional ceasefire. However, at that time, there were only local conflicts, which cannot be compared with today's large-scale war. I was personally involved in the matter, and I still remember it vividly. Now the CCP's approach is to put forward absurd so-called peace conditions on the one hand, and wantonly slander in its broadcasts, and instruct its commanders and combatants to continue fighting until the government accepts and implements its so-called peace conditions in the final stage. In this situation, if we think that the door to peace has been opened due to the CCP's response, it is either deceiving ourselves or fantasizing. Lei finally said: Peace is what the government seeks, but we must obtain the assurance that the other party has peace sincerity, an unconditional and immediate on-site ceasefire. At the same time, we ourselves must not mess up our steps and unite, so that there is a possibility of peace talks. If we only actively seek peace under the CCP's response, I am afraid that we are only moving towards the road of surrender. Therefore, we should not focus on peace talks all day long and ignore our own necessary preparations, because we must have the power to negotiate peace before we can negotiate peace, that is, we can only negotiate peace if we can fight.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Peace Promotion Association Was Established and Held a Standing Committee Meeting; Decided to Telegraph President Chiang and Mao Zedong <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Chinese Peace Promotion Association, initiated and organized by university professors and the National Policy Research Association, has been officially established and held a standing committee meeting to study the peace program and reform of political and economic principles advocated by the National Policy Research Association in its two telegrams of the 3rd and 13th. It was decided to use the two telegrams as a blueprint and combine them into a peace negotiation program for mediating the disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and to send a telegram in the name of the Chinese Peace Promotion Association to President Chiang and Mao Zedong for consideration. It is reported that the National Policy Research Association's proposals in the two telegrams have been approved by government officials such as Zhang Qun, but the proposed committee system of the coalition government has obviously suspended the constitution and the five-yuan system has come to an end, so these two points still need to be considered.</p>

<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 17th] The Xiang Provincial Government held an enlarged monthly meeting at 9 AM on the 17th. Chairman Cheng reported: (1) It is recognized that the eight conditions of the Communist Party are deliberately demanding and difficult to achieve, in order to fulfill their unwillingness to make peace. Today's problem is not whether everyone is willing to make peace, but that the Communist Party is unwilling to make peace. I hope everyone will calm their minds, judge right from wrong, and decide on the path to peace. (2) We must be of one heart and one mind, and give full play to everyone's strength. Don't fantasize. Even if peace is achieved, we will be controlled by others. (3) Financial fluctuations make everyone suffer, but this is the case in the entire current situation. Everyone must be hardworking and patient, "poor but strong," to overcome the difficulties. Finally, Cheng said that the Communist Party broadcast that he was one of the war criminals, believing that this would not make him succumb. He must ensure that the 30 million people of Hunan are stable before he has fulfilled his duties and relinquished his responsibilities.</p>

He's second daughter, Zhengmei (16 years old), was bombed to death, and his French wife, He Yiwen, and eldest daughter were also slightly injured by shrapnel. When reporters visited He's residence at No. 9 Xilahutong this morning, He had sent his wife and daughters to Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Only the body of the second daughter, Zhengmei, was still covered on the bed in the reception room. According to the workers at He's residence, He's wife's bedroom was hit by a bullet at 3:04 AM this morning, and the second daughter, who was sleeping alone in one bed, was bombed to death. He's wife and eldest daughter, who were sleeping in another bed, were also knocked to the ground by the shock and suffered minor injuries on their faces and bodies. Then, He's bedroom next door was also hit by a bullet. When the reporter inspected, he saw a large hole with a diameter of six or seven feet blasted through the roof of He's bedroom. The furniture, clothes and other items in the room were pressed by bricks, tiles and dust, in a mess, and the glass in the courtyard was also shattered by the shock.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th, 12 PM] He Siyuan, who was working for peace, was bombed in his residence this morning. He has taken his family to Peking Union Medical College Hospital. His second son was also slightly injured this morning while rescuing his mother and sister. He was originally scheduled to leave the city for negotiations today, but because of his injuries, he was unable to act and is recuperating in the hospital. He told those around him: Everyone should still be enthusiastic about the peace and promote its realization.</p>

<h3 id="e8">International Mediation Comes to an End: All Four Countries Believe There Is Currently Little Opportunity to Participate in Mediation <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Ta Kung Pao, Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] An authoritative source told reporters on the 17th that the government's efforts to seek peace through international mediation have now come to an end, but there may be new developments when the evolution of the domestic situation becomes a foregone conclusion. The source said that he did not know whether the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France had submitted formal replies to China's memorandum, nor did he know whether the four countries needed to submit formal replies, rejecting the invitation to participate in mediation. What he could say was that as a result of the government's diplomatic activities over the past week, it had obtained preliminary verbal replies from the ambassadors of the four countries. After considering China's memorandum and the situation in China, all countries believed that there was currently little opportunity to participate in mediation. According to another report obtained by reporters, Foreign Minister Wu did not report on diplomatic activities related to peace at the Kuomintang Central Political Committee meeting on the morning of the 17th, only saying that he would wait until later. Officials still refused to confirm or deny the rumors that the four countries had submitted formal replies to the Chinese government's memorandum.</p>
<h3 id="e9">The Youth Party Issued a Written Statement: Urging the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to Cease Fire and Make Peace; Do Not Repeat the Mistakes of Believing in Unification by Force <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our City News] The Standing Committee of the Chinese Youth Party held a meeting on the 17th and decided to submit the party's opinions on the current situation to Propaganda Minister Wang Shizeng for a written statement as follows:</p>
<p>The Tai Party deeply knows that the realization of peace is the common and urgent wish of the people of the whole country. President Chiang issued a proclamation advocating peace on New Year's Day, and CCP Chairman Mao Zedong issued a statement responding to peace on the 14th. This is a clear expression that the highest authorities of both sides have accepted the people's desire for peace. There are many conditions for achieving true peace, but this party believes that the rapid and effective prerequisite for achieving peace is that both sides individually restrain the troops under their command and immediately cease fire on the spot. All peace conditions should be jointly agreed upon by responsible personnel dispatched by both sides and a third party after the ceasefire. This party has always believed that only democratic peace can achieve national unity and progress, that relying solely on force is not enough, and advocates the nationalization of the military and the democratization of politics. The main reason for the breakdown of the Political Consultative Conference in 1946 cannot but be said to be due to the fact that both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party believed that their military strength was sufficient to suppress the other. Now that times have changed, we firmly hope that the Kuomintang will have this realization, and at the same time, we especially hope that the Communist Party will have this realization, resolutely cease fire and make peace, and never repeat the mistakes of believing in unification by force in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e10">The Atmosphere of Peace Permeates the Ancient Capital: The Representatives of the Promotion Association Failed to Leave the City Yesterday; Tanggu Has Lost Its Strategic Value, and the National Army Withdrew by Warships <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] The North China People's Peace Promotion Association originally recommended He Siyuan, He Haiqiu, Liang Qiushui and others to leave Xizhimen on the morning of the 17th to negotiate peace with the Communist side. However, because He Siyuan was injured and Liang Qiushui was old and weak and did not attend, they failed to make the trip. So at 10 AM, they held another meeting in the Senate and decided on three things: (1) Please ask both sides to stop fighting from now on to protect the safety of the cultural capital; (2) Please ask Commander-in-Chief Fu to provide convenience for entering and leaving the city; (3) Send representatives to contact the Communist side to provide convenience after leaving the city. Another meeting was held in the afternoon, but the content is still unknown.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] The Pingming Daily here reported: "The peace movement in Beiping has made significant progress in the past three days, and the next three days are the key to the Beiping peace movement. According to relevant sources, peace negotiations are in progress. It is heard that Nanjing has hinted that the Northern authorities can decide on the issue of peace and war in Beiping on their own."</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] The four suburbs of the ancient city are silent today. The attacking and defending sides have been using broadcasting equipment to attack the heart for days, and the atmosphere of peace permeates.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 17th] The CCP radio station here broadcast on the 17th that the "Beiping People's Government" was established on New Year's Day and appointed Ye Jianying as mayor and Xu Bing as deputy mayor. It is reported that the two have taken office on the 17th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th] A person in charge of the City Senate made a statement on the 17th, saying: Recently, the Communist army has been firing cold artillery shells into the city of Ping from time to time. More than a hundred shells have fallen, causing many casualties and damage to people and houses. The people of Ping City are extremely angry about this. The people of Ping City are now doing their best to protect the cultural relics of Beiping and are calling for peace. Since the Communist army is using the lifting of the people's suffering as a slogan, it should respect the people's opinions, cease fire and make peace. At a minimum, it should avoid all direct losses to the people as much as possible. The Kuomintang and the Communist army have not officially fought, and the Communist army's sudden attack on innocent citizens is only a cruel act and increases the people's resentment. It is a meaningless act. The citizens of Tai City are now gathering to discuss countermeasures and investigate the damage, and plan to protest this inhumane action to the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] After the end of the Tianjin war, Tanggu has lost its strategic value. It is heard that the National Army in the area has withdrawn by warship.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 17th] The CCP radio station in northern Shaanxi broadcast on the 17th that Tanggu had fallen. The broadcast said that the Tanggu defenders withdrew after the fall of Tianjin. Before that, the CCP radio station broadcast that it had captured General Chen Changjie, commander of the Tianjin Garrison, Liu Yunhan, commander of the 86th Army, and Lin Weichou, commander of the 62nd Army.</p>
<h3 id="e11">The North China Peace Promotion Association Sends Telegrams to President Chiang and Zedong: Demanding a Ceasefire Between the Two Sides, Negotiating Peace as Soon as Possible, The Choice Between Peace and War Lies in the Merits and Sins of a Thousand Autumns <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th] The North China People's Peace Promotion Association sent telegrams to President Chiang and Mao Zedong on the 16th to appeal for peace, express its views, demand a ceasefire between the two sides, and negotiate peace as soon as possible. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Nanjing, President Chiang, Honorable Mao Zedong, Yan'an: Our Chinese nation has suffered from the scourge of war for a long time. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the civil war has not stopped for a single day. The Lugouqiao Incident triggered an eight-year war of resistance before it ended. During this long period of time, the people have been devastated, the country has been fragmented, and the tragic situation is unprecedented. At the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance, we celebrated that the people could rest and that peace could be realized. Unexpectedly, the political consultations broke down halfway, and the military mediation failed to achieve complete success. As a result, the flames of war spread and gradually reached the whole country. Wherever the tragedy occurred, the old and weak turned to ditches, the young and strong died in artillery fire, houses became ruins, and fields were barren. All those who have personally experienced and witnessed this tragic situation are heartbroken, deeply hated, and resentful. I think it is also well understood by you. I believe that whether it is suppressing the rebellion or liberating, the ultimate goal is to save the people from fire and water. However, wherever the war goes, they fight for cities, killing people to fill the city, fighting for land, killing people to fill the wilderness. If this continues, the people's experience will be like water getting deeper and deeper, like fire getting hotter and hotter. It is tantamount to exhausting the military and abusing the people. The political parties, whether in power or in opposition, have political disputes due to different ideologies and beliefs. This happens in all countries, but they cannot use force as a tool for political disputes. Otherwise, those who save the people will harm the people, and those who build the country will harm the country. The result will be abandoned by the people. Our President Chiang insightfully took the lead and issued a proclamation, which has greatly opened the door to peace. Mr. Mao, in view of the overall situation, has also expressed his sincerity for peace. Moreover, both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are calling for democracy. No matter what their ideologies and beliefs are, they should like what the people like and hate what the people hate. This is the key to the success of political disputes and the true meaning of democratic politics. Today, the people are suffering from the scourge of war. What they like is peace, and what they hate is war. The so-called peace can be realized in a moment, and the so-called war can be avoided in mutual concession. Our President Chiang has decided to realize peace, and even does not care about his personal advancement and retreat. This open and upright mind should be understood by the people of the country and is expected by the people of the country. Mr. Mao is calling for democracy, and he must sacrifice his own views and be happy to accept the peace that the people of the whole country expect. The hearts of the people are only separated by a thought, and the merits and sins of a thousand autumns lie only in the choice between peace and war. We, the people of all circles in North China, are willing to express our views here, waiting for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to adopt them, and hope that each will have a more progressive expression, first order a ceasefire, so that peace can be negotiated as soon as possible, and the people can be relieved from their troubles. Then the country will be fortunate, and the people will be relieved.</p>

Female legislator Chen Yiyun advocated that peace talks should take into account their own position. Zhang Huiwen believed that in addition to the conditions of the Communist Party, there were other matters that should be paid attention to. In addition, Wu Shaoshu and Wang Lihang believed that in the process of striving for peace, the government should avoid measures that would hinder peace, such as closing newspapers and arresting political prisoners. Li Yongmao advocated demanding that the Communist Party express its views on individual freedom and national independence. During the discussion, the legislators were enthusiastic and spoke enthusiastically. Although their views differed, the talks were conducted in a harmonious atmosphere from beginning to end and dispersed at 9 PM.</p>

<p>[Our Chuxian Dispatch, 17th] The National Army on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway is implementing a planned strategic withdrawal in response to the current situation. Starting on the morning of the 17th, it has automatically abandoned Bengbu, Fengyang, and Linhuai Pass north of Mingguang, and took the initiative to withdraw the garrisons of Wuhe and Huaiyuan to the south of the Huai River two days ago. The nine-hole iron bridge across the Huai River north of Bengbu was also completely destroyed. As of the evening of the 17th, Mingguang was still guarded by a certain regiment of the National Army. The Jinpu Railway south of Mingguang was still unobstructed. The foreign telegrams that the Communist bandits had entered Bengbu on the afternoon of the 16th are obviously premature. In addition, Li Yannian, the commander of a certain army group originally stationed in Bengbu, left Bengbu on the morning of the 17th and arrived in Chu on the afternoon of the same day to confer with Commander Yang Gancai on the current military affairs.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The regular troops of the National Army in Bengbu have taken the initiative and safely transferred to Mingguang and other favorable areas starting on the morning of the 17th. Only a part of the plainclothes team is currently controlling the city of Bengbu. The railway between Zha and Bengbu Mingguang has also been dismantled by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Zhou Longguang, Commander of the Jinpu Railway Protection Command, Gan Yanqing, Deputy Commander, and Xu Yunsheng, Chief of Staff, led their troops to withdraw from here at 10 AM on the morning of the 17th to go to Beijing and await orders. In addition, the Chuzhou Command Post of the Capital Garrison Command was also ordered to withdraw to Beijing on the 18th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] Military sources here said today that the government had concentrated 150,000 troops along the Huai River, which is about 300 miles long. The Communist army on the north bank of the Huai River currently has no large-scale deployment, only small groups that have sneaked into the south bank are advancing into the vacuum area of the National Army's 6th Army's withdrawal. It is heard that the main force of the Communist army in central China has begun to prepare for a general offensive in northern Jiangsu. Liu Bocheng's troops are moving towards Mengcheng, 50 miles northwest of Bengbu, while Chen Yi's troops are heading straight for Hongze Lake, 80 miles northeast. However, after the 6th Army moved south, it greatly strengthened the National Army's defense line from Shanghai in the east to Wuhu in the west.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Washington Economic Cooperation Administration Announces Temporary Suspension of Flour Shipments to China; Qingdao ECA Branch Does Not Consider Withdrawal <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[This City News] According to news from the ECA Branch, the Washington Economic Cooperation Administration recently announced that due to the major North China port of Dagukou no longer being able to accommodate unloading, the Administration is adjusting its flour and wheat shipment procedures to China. Under this new procedure, all flour awaiting shipment will be temporarily suspended from loading, and ships en route to China will also change their destination. The ECA regularly supplies 36,000 tons of flour per month for rationing, of which 28,000 tons, or three-quarters of the total, are shipped to Tianjin and Beijing. However, since December 24th of last year, military operations have prevented the ECA's American-aided wheat and flour from being transported to North China cities. The Administration has therefore diverted this flour to ports further south, with as much as 40,000 tons being diverted to Qingdao, resulting in the city's warehouses being filled to capacity. The remaining food supplies originally intended for North China have been diverted to Shanghai. As a result, the food reserves in both locations far exceed normal levels. Therefore, the ECA believes that it is necessary to adjust transportation procedures in order to suit current consumption levels.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao, 17th dispatch] Personnel from the Tianjin ECA Branch are still in Tianjin, with a large quantity of food and supplies stored there. Whether the Communist side will continue to allow the ECA to continue its rationing system, or whether it will take over the materials, is, according to people from the American Aid Utilization Association, "a test of the Communist side's relationship with American aid." Furthermore, under any circumstances, the Qingdao ECA Branch is not considering withdrawing, and a large quantity of materials is currently being loaded and unloaded.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th dispatch] Congressman Bloom stated on the 16th that at least a portion of China can still be saved from falling to the Communists, but President Chiang must step down. Bloom will assume the chairmanship of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 18th, and his attitude will play an important role in deciding the future of American aid to China.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Discussing Peace Talks Calmly <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Since Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party broadcasted the eight conditions for peace talks, there have been diverse opinions among people from all walks of life. According to news last night, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee discussed the matter yesterday. Although there were some debates, except for the clause on "punishing war criminals," which was opposed by all, the rest were considered open for discussion. From this, it can be seen that the central authorities of the Kuomintang do not have any overwhelming outrage. Naturally, we do not want the glimmer of hope to fade again, and we sincerely hope that both sides will calmly discuss the necessity of reopening peace talks.</p>
<p>First, both sides must recognize that it is the people, especially the common people, who truly want peace. Therefore, if both sides' authorities truly have the so-called "people" in mind, they should abandon their own views and put themselves in the people's shoes. In the years of war, it is the people who have died and been injured by the thousands, it is the people who have been bankrupted, and it is the people who have been displaced, hungry, and cold. What crime have the people committed to suffer such misery? If both sides still have a conscience, they should temporarily put everything else aside at this time and simultaneously order a ceasefire. This is the key to Mao Zedong's so-called "rapidly ending the war and reducing the suffering of the people." Any conditions can be discussed properly and openly after the ceasefire. This is the way to have the compassionate heart of a Bodhisattva and the heroic spirit of serving the country and the people. It must be understood that two people fighting must first stop fighting before they can talk. This is common sense! The North-China Daily News editorial yesterday believed that any party that insists on its own views will find it difficult to escape the bad reviews of historians in the future, and wondered if either side has great figures who can seize this opportunity. We feel the same way. The key to seizing this opportunity for peace lies in an immediate ceasefire. If the Chinese Communist Party is unwilling to "quickly end the war" on the one hand, and intensifies its offensive on the other, seemingly wanting to implement Mao Zedong's so-called plan to "resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the reactionaries" in the posture of a victor, then whether there is sincerity for peace cannot but be doubted.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the conditions, we believe that they should all be matters for after the ceasefire. The contents of the conditions already revealed by both sides, the five principles and the eight points, have differences, which is not surprising. What is strange is the introduction of a new term, "punishing war criminals." The Chinese have always valued "moderation," which is the most precious thing. Therefore, in Chinese history, even in dynastic changes, the victorious side has never imposed such harsh measures as "punishing war criminals," let alone that the Chinese Communist Party may not necessarily have a complete victory today. Moreover, speaking of war criminals, it is nothing more than imposing the responsibility for the war. Then, who should bear the actual responsibility for breaking the Political Consultative Conference and resuming the conflict several years ago? Only the people can judge impartially, and it is by no means something that the Chinese Communist Party can completely impose on the government. The people only want the war to end quickly and do not want to demand responsibility for the war any further. What is even more ridiculous is that while the Chinese Communist Party regards all those responsible in the government as "war criminals," they also say that they are willing to negotiate peace with the "reactionary government." Nothing in the world is more contradictory and absurd than this. May I ask: under the basic condition of "punishing war criminals," who in the current government is qualified to negotiate with the Chinese Communist Party?</p>
<p>Third, we believe that it is best not to insist on the other conditions proposed by both sides at this time, but to allow everyone to have a calm discussion after the ceasefire and to be decided by the public opinion of the people. Although the constitution was formulated by the National Assembly, it is not something that cannot be changed. If there are better opinions, why not discuss them at length and revise them? The most important thing about the legal system is the form of government and the political system. The form of government must not be changed, but the political system may be adapted to the times. Reorganizing the army is a natural task after the war, and the most important thing is the absolute nationalization of any army. As for confiscating bureaucratic capital and reforming the land system, they are absolutely beautiful as slogans and slogans. Such arguments have long been loudly proclaimed in the Kuomintang, so in the future, it is only necessary to clearly define the boundaries, formulate methods, and implement them one by one, and there should not be much obstacle. As for the so-called "treasonous treaties," if they do exist, they should of course be abolished, but I don't know whether the Chinese Communist Party also advocates abolishing the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, which ceded Outer Mongolia and ruined many interests in the Northeast? Convening a Political Consultative Conference to form a democratic coalition government was originally the original proposal of the previous Political Consultative Conference, but the appended condition that "reactionary elements" are not allowed to participate cannot but be questioned. If it is said that the people in charge of the current government are all "war criminals" and "reactionary elements" and are not allowed to participate, then I don't know who the political consultation will be with. What we regret the most is that the point in the President's message that "the people can maintain their free way of life and the current minimum standard of living" is the most in line with the people's expectations, but it is precisely what Mao Zedong ignored and did not mention in a single word. We believe that what the people will pay the most attention to after the ceasefire is not the constitution on paper or the list of officials, but how the people themselves live and whether they have freedom. If both sides are truly for the country and the people, they should devote all their attention to this.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to earnestly persuade the warring parties: the war is too cruel! The people are too miserable! The Kuomintang's decades of revolution was originally to save the people; the Communist Party also said it wanted to liberate the people. Now the people have already pleaded with both sides to cease fire and negotiate peace. Both sides should stop and let it go! "Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot!" Please both sides' authorities close your eyes and think: how many compatriots' lives are waiting to be decided by your one thought? Buddhism has the so-called six perfections, with charity at the head and forbearance being the most difficult. The extreme of charity is to give life as charity; the extreme of forbearance is to endure dismemberment and quietly endure. Why? For the sake of saving all beings? President Yuan also said in his message that he only hopes that peace can be realized, and he will not worry about anything else. This is close to the spirit of giving up fame and position as charity; and having been subjected to the insult of being the "number one war criminal" by the Chinese Communist Party, he is still willing to study its conditions, which is especially rich in the spirit of "forbearance." He deserves to be called a Bodhisattva heart. I sincerely hope that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party can also break through their ego and resolutely cease fire, so that peace talks can begin immediately, and the overall situation in China will be clear and bright. Whether the Chinese Communist Party is truly for the people or not, please show it with facts!</p>

It could have been rejected, but at that time, Qingdao was suffering from a severe famine and it was urgent to ration the flour immediately.

<p>[United Press, London, 16th dispatch] Reliable sources say that when the Western European Union foreign ministers begin their meeting in London on the 25th of this month, cooperation within the colonies will be discussed. France, as a country other than the United Kingdom, has been actively invited to participate in the development of the Far East. Burma, Siam, and the Netherlands will undoubtedly be contacted immediately. At the same time, former colonial officials, including former Hong Kong Governor Sassoon, are compiling a memorandum to strengthen the importance of "maintaining the integrity of the Western European Union's overseas territories," as the effectiveness of the Western European Union depends on this. The memorandum points out that the signatory countries of the Western European Union should collectively control their world colonies and affiliated territories. Excluding the British Dominions (some of which also have affiliated territories), the territories controlled by the Western European Union countries total more than nine million square miles, with a population of more than 300 million. These territories include those in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, the Mediterranean, and the Caribbean Sea. It is said that colonial and diplomatic officials will encourage maintaining the integrity of these territories within the Western European Union. The suggestions also include Portugal. According to unofficial British sources, a delegation will be sent to Lisbon in May to discuss this possibility.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Kremlin Implements Plan to Tighten Control Over Satellite States and Develops Czechoslovakia as a Strategic Base <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 17th] U.S. officials reported on the 17th that the Soviet Union is launching a campaign to place Eastern European countries completely under its control. American experts believe that the Soviet Union is intensifying the Sovietization of satellite states because it fears that other countries behind the Iron Curtain will follow Yugoslavia's example and defect from the Kremlin. It is said that the effect of the Soviet officials' plan has already reduced the living standards in Eastern Europe, and its ultimate goal is to make the living standards in Eastern Europe lower than those in the Soviet Union, and then incorporate several satellite states into the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Well-informed sources said that official information received here indirectly shows that the Soviet Union has recently begun a larger operation to tighten its control over satellite states. The Soviet Union is carrying out the plan in the following ways: (1) Requiring immediate possession of certain major industries and sources of raw materials. This will probably be done by continuing to seize former German assets as compensation or war booty. (2) Organizing joint ventures with satellite states and sharing the interests of the companies with the satellite states. The interests enjoyed by the Soviet Union in these joint ventures include tax exemptions and the Soviet government's control over raw materials, priority rights, mining rights, and production increase rights, and profits and dividends are sent to the Soviet Union in the form of goods. (3) Concluding trade agreements with satellite states, which will strengthen the Soviet Union's supply of raw materials in exchange for manufactured goods. (4) Destroying the independent political and economic power of labor through trade unions controlled by the Communist Party, and absorbing the Socialist Party by the Communist Party. (5) Intensifying the review of Communist Party membership.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 17th] The "New York Times" today quoted Hette Lich, an advisor to former Czech President Beneš, as saying that the Soviet Union is turning the Czech Republic and Poland into the "Ruhr of Eastern Europe." Stalin wants to develop the Czech Republic as a major source of Soviet economic recovery and military supplies, as well as a strategic base for attacking the West and defending itself. He believes that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe will be a new type of "commercial colonialism."</p>

<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 17th] General MacArthur is closely watching the developments before the 23rd general election, as the election will show whether Japan intends to preserve democracy or be swept into the torrent of Asian communism. Reliable sources said that MacArthur is extremely concerned about the outcome of the election, because the Communist Party obviously has the potential to win many seats in the lower house, because the prime minister and half of his cabinet members will be produced by the lower house. MacArthur and his headquarters officials are extremely anxious about the fact that Japanese citizens are not interested in the general election, because the Japanese Communist Party is well-organized, has sufficient financial resources, and is under the command of those trained in Moscow, so this situation is extremely beneficial to the Japanese Communist Party.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 17th] Filipinos are eager to understand their position in the U.S.'s far-reaching Pacific defense plan. Whether the policy needs to be changed as a result of the Communist Party's victory in China. Philippine President Quirino believes that the answer to this question is of great importance to the future of the Philippines. Quirino publicly stated that he will go to Washington to discuss with President Truman, and the Pacific military strategy issue will be the biggest topic. The U.S. military strategy in the Philippines follows the decision at the end of 1946. Due to the insistence of the Philippines, all U.S. bases in the metropolitan area must be abandoned. This condition must be fulfilled by March of this year. The strength of the U.S. garrison has been gradually reduced in the past. By the end of September 1949, the 29,000 Filipino troops in the U.S. military will be completely disbanded, and the last batch of U.S. troops stationed in the Philippines will also depart. The U.S. 13th Air Force Command moved out last December, leaving only the Pursuit Aircraft Command. The U.S. Navy has a repair factory in Subic Bay and a naval air base at Sangley Point in Manila Bay.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 17th] Two senior Dutch officials flew to Bangka Island this morning to immediately release the six ministers and officials of the Indonesian Republic who were detained. The Dutch authorities were quite surprised that the Indonesian officials were still punished when the United Nations Mediation Committee visited Bangka Island on the 15th. It is reported that the Dutch personnel who delayed the detention will be dismissed.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Municipal Government recently announced: The price of rationed rice in this city has been temporarily adjusted according to the market price ratio after being decided by the central government, and the news has been published. It is now decided that the price of rationed rice this month is 140 yuan per dou (12 jin of whole rice and 3 jin of broken rice), and the price of key rationed rice is 95 yuan per dou. Rationing will continue at the above prices from the 20th. In order to facilitate the accounting of rice stores, rationing will be suspended on the 18th and 19th. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] The relevant authorities in this city are making active preparations for the government's call for public and private organizations to store grain for three months. According to reporters, in addition to the fact that the rationed grain in this city has been completely raised this month, the U.S. aid grain stored by the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration is still sufficient for one month, and the grain purchased by the Emergency Grain Storage Committee entrusted by the China Farmers Bank and other institutions and grain merchants has arrived in Zhu and totaled 540,000 shi, which is also sufficient for one month. Therefore, the supply problem of rationed grain in this city within three months has been largely resolved, and the period of grain shortage that will come in a blink of an eye will hardly pose any threat to this city. However, relevant parties believe that the complete control of rationed grain is of great benefit to the food problem of the people of this city. However, rationed grain cannot solve the needs of all food for the people. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the people of this city will do their best to purchase and store the amount needed within three months, so as to reduce concerns about future life.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Wang Zhibin and Liu Yunge, two legislators nominated by the People's Socialist Party, were suspected of selling opium. After investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office, they were publicly prosecuted yesterday. The original indictment is recorded below:</p>
<p>"On July 18, 1948, personnel dispatched by the Shanghai Jianghai Customs inspected passengers on China National Aviation Corporation flight number 103 from Peiping to Shanghai at Longhua Airport. They discovered that the defendant Wang Zhibin was carrying two suitcases with false bottoms, containing opium weighing approximately 10.5 kilograms. When apprehended, the defendant stated that the two suitcases belonged to Liu Yunge, who was waiting at the airport to receive him. Subsequently, Jianghai Customs handed over Wang and Liu, along with the opium, to the Police Department to be transferred to the Criminal Division of this Court for investigation. Regarding</p>
<p>Wang Zhibin</p>
<p>Wang stated at the police station that the two suitcases containing opium were carried by him. After strict interrogation, he continued that a friend he had known for a long time, Xu Songjiu, entrusted him to take a batch of raw opium to Shanghai and hand it over to Liu Yunge. The opium was packed in two suitcases with false bottoms. To avoid easy detection during inspection, the clothes were divided and placed on the upper layer of the two suitcases as camouflage. Unexpectedly, the plane was discovered as soon as it arrived in Shanghai, and so on. When the Criminal Division of this Court and this office investigated successively, the defendant intended to retract his confession, falsely claiming that he did not know that the suitcases contained opium. However, the investigation revealed that the suitcases were carried by the defendant, and the bottom layer contained raw opium, weighing up to 10.5 kilograms, which was not a small amount. Moreover, the upper layer contained clothes, which the defendant also did not deny. It is clear that he knowingly concealed the opium with clothing, which is difficult to accept with deceptive excuses. Furthermore, whether Xu Songjiu exists and whether he entrusted the transportation also lacks evidence. There is no doubt that the opium in the two suitcases belongs to the defendant. Regarding</p>
<p>Liu Yunge</p>
<p>Although the defendant denied that the suitcases belonged to him, he went to the airport to meet Wang Zhibin when the defendant arrived in Shanghai, intending to help avoid inspection and achieve the purpose of selling. Moreover, he and Wang Zhibin lived together in Peiping for a long time. He cannot escape criminal responsibility for colluding with Wang Zhibin in planning to sell opium and sharing the actions of the crime by empty sophistry. In summary, the defendants' actions constitute the crimes stipulated in Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for Punishing Opium and Drug Prohibition and Article 28 of the Criminal Law. However, considering that the time of the crime was within the period of implementation of the old Regulations for Punishing Opium and Drug Prohibition, according to the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, it should be punished in accordance with Article 257, Paragraph 1 of the same law, and a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."</p>

<p>Recently, prices have soared, and the problem of making a living has become increasingly difficult. With the start of the spring term of the 38th year approaching in the blink of an eye, the seriousness of the problem of young people dropping out of school is to be expected. In view of this, this newspaper has decided to continue the "Reader Scholarship" campaign and will begin fundraising from today. The number of scholarships for this term is planned to be 100 university students and 300 high school students. Assuming that each university student is subsidized with 2,400 yuan and each middle school student is subsidized with an average of 1,800 yuan, the total budget should be around one million yuan. At the same time, in order to maintain the value of the currency and prevent it from depreciating, the donations received will be entrusted to rice merchants to purchase and store white rice at market prices. When distributing the funds, the actual goods will be calculated to ensure that the students receiving assistance receive practical benefits. As the saying goes, "The greatest joy is in doing good deeds," and providing assistance to young people who have dropped out of school is the most meaningful of good deeds. This newspaper sincerely appeals to enthusiastic people from all walks of life to donate generously so that this campaign can achieve its expected goal as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e87">United Association of All Circles for Self-Salvation and National Salvation Telegraphed to Council to Respond to Appeal for Peace; Please Forward to All National Organizations to Quickly Send Representatives to Shanghai to Discuss Major Plans Together <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The United Association of All Circles for Self-Salvation and National Salvation in Shanghai telegraphed the Municipal Council on behalf of yesterday and requested that the telegram be forwarded to the Municipal Councils of all provinces and cities and national people's organizations. In addition to responding to the association's suggestion to convene a national peace promotion meeting in Shanghai on February 10, it is hoped that all organizations will quickly send representatives to Shanghai to jointly study a reasonable compromise plan based on the five principles indicated in the President's New Year's Day message and the eight conditions proposed by the Chinese Communist Party. The original telegram is as follows: "To the Municipal Councils of all provinces and cities and the National People's Organizations: Since the President's New Year's Day message calling for peace and the people's livelihood, all the people who are suffering from war and displacement are celebrating with their hands raised and rejoicing at the dawn, so that they can avoid the destruction of their mountains and rivers and expect the stability of life. Everyone is watching the discussions and the psychology is the same. Your council, which likes what the people like, telegraphed the municipal councils of all provinces and cities and national people's organizations to come to Shanghai on February 10 to discuss peace together before the central government has any response. This is truly the common hope of the people and a suggestion to protect the national pulse and the lives of the people. Now, the Chinese Communist Party has already broadcasted Mr. Mao Zedong's response to the New Year's Day message, also ending the war and reducing the suffering of the people, and hoping for true peace. Therefore, your council's urging of all parties to come to Shanghai at that time to discuss national affairs should not be delayed. Although the eight conditions proposed by the Chinese Communist Party do not fully comply with the principles of ending the war and reducing the suffering of the people, both sides in the struggle may have angry words, which is also common. Moreover, the Chinese Communist Party's broadcast pointed out that the government's criticism of relying solely on force was a mistake and would not laugh at its previous failures and still follow its old path. This is to be expected of those who have learned their lesson and are willing to endure for the sake of the country. Therefore, we telegraphed your council to re-telegraph the municipal councils of all provinces and cities and national people's organizations to send representatives to Shanghai quickly, so that they can study the five principles and eight conditions together, discuss a reasonable compromise plan, and persuade them with love for the country and the people, so that the true peace of allowing for stopping the dispute may not be obtained from this. The Shanghai United Association of All Circles for Self-Salvation and National Salvation."</p>
<p>The Council Re-Telegraphed Urgently to Discuss the Compromise of Peace</p>
<p>After the Municipal Council of this city initiated the convening of the National Peace Promotion Conference in Shanghai on February 10, up to today, the following have responded one after another: the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Jiangsu Provincial Council, the Shanxi Provincial Council, the Shandong Provincial Provisional Council, the Zhejiang Provincial Council, the Shandong Provincial Federation of Commerce, the Wuxing Branch of the Zhejiang Rural Culture Promotion Association, the Chongqing Municipal Council, the Hankou Municipal Council, the Hunan Provincial Council, the National Federation of Physicians' Associations, and the Nanjing Municipal Council, a total of twelve units. All organizations have agreed to send representatives to Shanghai to attend the conference and discuss major plans together. The Municipal Council recently stated that although the eight conditions proposed by the Chinese Communist Party Mao Zedong's broadcast as the basis for peace talks were still far from the five principles of the President's New Year's Day message, it could be seen that the door to peace talks had not yet been closed and the opportunity could not be missed. Yesterday, it telegraphed again to the Municipal Councils of all provinces and cities and national professional organizations, urging them to first show the names of the representatives and to send them to Shanghai before February 10, so that the conference could be held in a timely manner to study a reasonable compromise plan based on the five principles and eight conditions from the people's standpoint and to persuade them with love for the country and the people, so as to promote the realization of true peace. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To the National Municipal Councils of All Provinces and Cities and the United Federations of National Professional Organizations: The President issued a New Year's message advocating peace, and this association has requested you to jointly appeal with a winter telegram, and then suggested with a Qi telegram to convene a national peace promotion meeting in Shanghai on February 10 this year. Respectfully request the speaker and deputy speaker of the Municipal Councils of each province and city or their designated responsible representatives, the chairman of each national professional organization or mutually elected executive directors, to quickly send them to come and discuss how to promote peace as in the case. In recent days, the majority of provinces and cities have telegraphed their approval one after another and have agreed to send representatives to attend. According to reports, Mr. Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party has broadcasted and proposed eight conditions as the basis for peace talks. Although it is still far from the five principles of the President's New Year's message, it cannot be said that it is not also intended to end the war and reduce the suffering of the people. All of our people should expect each other to endure for the sake of the country. It is said that the door to peace talks has not been closed, and the opportunity cannot be missed. Therefore, we will telegraphed again, and we still hope that you will refer to the suggestions in the previous telegram, first show the names of the representatives, and send them to Shanghai before February 10, so that the meeting can be held in a timely manner to study a reasonable compromise plan based on the five principles and eight conditions from the people's standpoint and to persuade them with love for the country and the people, so that the true peace of allowing for stopping the dispute may not be obtained from this. The Shanghai Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jilao, Zi, Xiao, Seal."</p>
<p>The Banking Industry's Professional Association Telegraphed</p>
<p>The Joint Federation of Bank and Commercial Associations of the Republic of China also issued a telegram calling for peace as follows:</p>
<p>"President Nan Yijiang, Mr. Mao Zedong of Yan'an, and all national organizations and newspaper offices: (Omitted) This association is the hub of the national financial system. Since the War of Resistance, it has made up for deficiencies and looked forward to seeing the prosperity of peaceful nation-building after difficult management. Unexpectedly, the wounds have not yet healed, and the walls have risen again. Wherever the mutiny has passed, it has destroyed the foundation of the bank's thin trees for fifty years. Those who can barely survive are also swaying in the wind and rain and cannot see tomorrow. For whom is it sacrificed and what is its meaning? The pain is profound, and I cannot understand it after much thought. It is painful to say. I have been stuck in my throat for three years and have to shed tears and say it. I humbly ask all the people of the country to look forward to it. I only hope that you will be wise."</p>

<p>Rice prices rose again yesterday due to high prices in the production areas, increased transportation costs, and the suspension of gold and silver deposits and exchanges, causing widespread panic. Sellers raised prices, initially quoting 200 yuan higher. Thin rice was once quoted at 1,700 yuan. Later, due to sluggish sales at rice shops, prices in the central market slightly declined. White japonica rice opened at 1,600 yuan, up 180 yuan from last week; thin rice at 1,650 yuan, and early rice at 1,600 yuan, each up 180 yuan.

The total arrivals in the two markets yesterday were 3,153 shi.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Due to the rise in rice prices and a general increase in the prices of various outside goods, the market sentiment was strong. Small investors were actively purchasing, causing prices to soar. Various brands of flour uniformly exceeded 600 yuan. Old brand flour opened and closed at 620 yuan, a sharp increase of 70 yuan, or 15%. The highest price reached 635 yuan. Navy brand flour closed at 608 yuan, while Red Bee and Jiancheng brands each closed at 600 yuan, all up 75-76 yuan. Large bags of iron sheet flour rose by 56 yuan, with Fuxin large bags closing at 446 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Started strong, then weakened. Soybean prices initially rose across the board due to the easing of credit and the rise in rice prices. Hankou car soybeans briefly crossed the 1,000 yuan mark, with Sangyuan also opening at 1,000 yuan. However, the market weakened later, falling back by 80 yuan due to the decline in various other commodities outside the market. Corn prices were initially chaotic, with Hengjiang and Huangdu briefly hitting the 900 yuan mark. It closed slightly lower by 50 yuan, ending at 850 yuan.

Later, news of price declines in outside goods caused widespread unease, and buyers hesitated, leading to a decline in prices. Soybean oil closed at 5,200 yuan, up 430 yuan from last Saturday.

Superior grade spot opened at 92,000 yuan, already up about 10,000 yuan from last Saturday. However, news of a decline in gold prices caused sentiment to weaken. Furthermore, with tight credit conditions and high interest rates, more sellers emerged, and the market declined to 90,000 yuan by noon. In the afternoon, the market for outside goods was quiet, and quotations did not improve, increasing selling interest. Quotations fell another 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Satin: The market was tight when trading opened yesterday. Buyers were eager, and quotations moved towards a high peak. The American-Asian brand bedspread opened at a high price of 53,000 yuan, causing the market to immediately reach its daily price limit. Prices continued to rise outside the market, reaching as high as 54,500 yuan. Later, news of a sharp rise and fall in the black market for foreign exchange, combined with the weakening of the yarn market, caused sentiment to soften. Buying interest dissipated, and the market declined as both buyers and sellers closed out their positions. It closed at 53,700 yuan, still a significant increase.</p>
<h3 id="e100">India to Open Silk Imports in February This Year <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>According to information obtained by the China Silk Corporation, India is the largest overseas market for Chinese silk fabrics. However, India's restrictions on silk imports in recent years have significantly affected China's silk exports. According to recent confirmed reports: India will open silk imports in March of this year. The China Silk Corporation has dispatched personnel to oversee the matter. It is reported that after the continued opening of silk imports this year, China's silk sales in India could reach over 100,000 bolts. It is said that the cost of domestic silk is quite high. According to current calculations, the foreign exchange certificate must be sold at 250 yuan to be profitable.</p>

<p>According to information obtained by the silk industry, during the enemy occupation period, the production equipment for silk in the areas along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was almost entirely destroyed by the enemy. After liberation, continuous efforts were made to reorganize and replenish the industry, resulting in significant improvements. It is estimated that the silk production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year will reach approximately 2.5 million dan. If the situation is stable, it could reach 3.5 to 4 million dan next year, reaching the pre-war levels.</p>
<h3 id="e102">China Textile Corporation Sells in Large Quantities; Cotton Yarn Lacks Strength; Cotton Cloth Excites Market Sentiment; Supply and Demand Balanced <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Yesterday, due to the initial suspension of gold and silver exchange, the China Textile Construction Corporation continued to sell yarn in large quantities on behalf of the National Bank and the American Aid Association. A total of 2,500 bales of various yarn counts were offered in six batches. As a result, purchase requests were made for 1,290 bales, which were all allocated. Among them, due to the Gong Sheng Factory's failure to repay the bobbins owed to the Textile Construction Corporation, 10 bales were not allocated. Therefore, the actual sales were 1,280 bales, recovering a total of 65,837,500 yuan. The names, quantities, and unit prices of the sold yarn counts are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>20-count Golden Rooster: 467 bales, 44,500 yuan per bale. 20-count Fairy Peach: 118 bales, 45,000 yuan per bale. 32-count Immediately: 135 bales, 59,000 yuan per bale. 42-count Double-Strand Red and Blue Phoenix: 188 bales, 74,500 yuan per bale. 42-count Double-Strand Immediately: 35 bales, 74,500 yuan per bale. 20-count Double Globe: 347 bales, 45,000 yuan per bale.</p>
<p>Also, the Textile Construction Corporation sold yarn again yesterday, as usual, selling a total of 68 bales, equivalent to 149 bales of 20-count yarn, recovering a total of 4,397,000 yuan. The approved prices for each yarn count were: 15-count Harvest and 16-count Red Moon, both at 39,000 yuan, 32-count Yanghe at 58,000 yuan, 40-count Red Treasure Light at 67,000 yuan, and 42-count Double-Strand Red Immediately at 72,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market showed a circling trend, with narrow fluctuations. Trading in the market was not active because direct sales in various regions were extremely sluggish, and local sales were also weak. As a result, the performance of each yarn was mixed.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix retreated from 79,000 yuan to close at 75,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan from the weekend. 40-count Blue Phoenix also rose by 1,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon saw a larger increase of 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot opened at 57,000 yuan and closed at 54,000 yuan, ultimately rising by 2,000 yuan. Factory orders, however, were higher by 3,000 yuan, ending at 47,000 yuan. One-day arbitrage traded at 2,500 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was priced well at 5,000 yuan. Yarn counts below one were slightly lower.</p>
<p>The cloth market rose sharply. Market sentiment was stimulated by the suspension of gold and silver exchange, leading to a universally bullish outlook. There were many buyers, but many sellers were also forced to sell at high prices to meet their funding needs, resulting in a balanced supply and demand in the market.</p>
<p>The general asking price for Longtou fine cloth outside the market was around 2,300 yuan, up about 400-500 yuan from the weekend. Five Happiness fine cloth traded at 2,270 yuan, Trumpet Electric fine cloth at 2,100 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge was quoted from 2,000 to a high of 2,170 yuan. Due to the fact that there were sellers towards close, it closed at 2,040 yuan, a sharp increase of 360 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Serge rose by 350 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong was at 2,220 yuan, ultimately up 420 yuan. The rest of the market saw gains across the board. However, with sluggish sales to customers, it is feared that the bullish momentum may not last.</p>

<p>Seeking Lost Child Chen Xingming</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor-in-Chief of the Shen Bao: Greetings. My third son, Xingming, unfortunately went missing on the morning of January 13th at 8:00 AM on Douxing Road. We have searched with gongs and offered rewards, but to this day, there is no news. Xingming's pet name is Gou Dan. He is six years old, speaks Sichuan dialect, wears a sesame-colored cotton coat, a black woolen student cap, and black rubber galoshes. He has a yellow apricot-colored satin tag with the character "Tai" hanging in front of his chest. (The vehicle and boat ticket has Chen Jianxun's name on it). Jianxun has been working at the Army University for over ten years. This trip to Shanghai is to move with the school to Guangzhou and cannot stay here for long. I earnestly request that you publish this in various newspapers. Jianxun is willing to offer a reward of 2,000 gold yuan. If he can be found after Jianxun leaves for Guangzhou, please send him to Mr. Zeng Zhongwu at the Guangzhao Guildhall, 5th Floor, 40 Ningbo Road to be taken care of. Respectfully, Chen Jianxun, January 15th.</p>
