<h3>軍校同學非常委會　告各軍校同學書</h3>
<p>〔中央社本報訊〕中央各軍事學校同學成立之「非常委員會」，昨（二日）舉行會議，對有關重要會務及行動綱領，作具體研討，並通過發佈「告各軍校同學書」，茲探誌原文如後：</p>
<p>革命的同學同志們：</p>
<p>今日何日，乃偉大而艱鉅的國民革命事業遭受中國共產匪黨不斷的要擊與破壞，已經到了非常嚴重的關頭，撒無量熱血，所奮鬥得來的勝利果實，在共產國際的擴展政治與侵略政策下祭養，並嗾使中共匪黨暴力集團絕滅人性，出賣祖國，蹂躪人權，斷送國脈民命，使五千年的文化歷史，瀕於毀滅，且已使國家民族與人民大眾陷入危亡的絕境，與最黑暗的時期，共產匪黨在中國廿餘年來暴動鬥爭殺人放火的罪惡，已屬人盡皆知，無待列舉，只看中共非黨於抗戰勝利後，幫助赤色帝國主義拆遷日本在我東北五十餘年來壓榨中國人民與辦的價值廿餘億美元以上的各種工礦設備。最近匪首毛澤東爲效忠其外國主子，復喊吶和平，反對大西洋公約，公然發表聲明，實稱第三次世界大戰一旦發生，當與蘇聯並肩作戰，以上這些事實，已充分表現中國匪黨甘心爲赤色帝國主義者的第五縱隊，來屠殺我同胞，摧毀我國脈，破壞我民族獨立自主之精神和劫奪我人民之自由與權力。不惜把中國整個的領土關入鐵幕，變成第三次世界大戰的戰場，更不惜把全中國愛好和平的良善人民變成共產國際的砲灰，他這種毒辣的心腸，陰狠的手法，實可謂前無古人，後無來者。</p>
<p>鐵一般的事實證明，中國共產匪黨暴力集團猙獰的真面目，在於</p>
<p>（一）以附庸鐵幕爲解放，任意出賣國家之領土主權，充分表現其反民族主義的行爲；</p>
<p>（二）以脅迫奴役爲翻身，任意摧殘人民的自由權利，充分表現其反民權主義的行爲；</p>
<p>（三）以劫掠侵奪爲清算，任意破壞人民的生命財產，充分表現其反民生主義的行爲。</p>
<p>但這個保利集團的匪魁毛澤東，本其「成則爲王，敗則爲寇」的心理與「流氓地痞革命先鋒」的故智，及裏脅農民武裝暴動的作法，替赤色帝國主義者爲虎作倀，在落後的中國公然抬頭，切肆設其所謂「新民主主義的反帝反封建反官僚資本的行爲」，以爲其虛偽欺騙宣傳的護符，切冀藉此演示其禍國賣國殃民虐民的罪惡，這個元惡大煞，如不殲除，真可謂「國亡種滅禍不旋踵」的訓示，踏着先烈的血跡，追隨全國志士仁人之後，與全國同胞，全體袍澤一致奮鬥，以求三民主義民有，民治，民享的崇高理想的實現。二十餘年來，我同學同志前仆後繼，成仁赴義，以鮮血寫就之可歌可泣的光榮歷史，其積累的成就，已造成之國家統一獨立民主進步的新機運，乃因外則有較暴日尤爲兇狠的共產國際赤色帝國主義者，利用世界大戰後窮困紛擾的局勢，實行擴張侵略的陰謀，幷嗾使資助中共匪黨，破壞國家的獨立統一民主進步的機運，以遂其赤化中國，赤化亞洲的野心，內則有一部對革命主義信仰不騫，腐敗落伍，投機取巧，食生怕死的敗類，不知愛護此得來不易之國家獨立統一民主進步的機運，或則腐蝕革命的陣容，或則與匪黨互相呼應，如是共產匪黨暴力集團，得以乘間伺隙恣雎暴戾，而使革命事葉遭受空前未有的挫敗。</p>
<p>就國內外局勢精密審查，佷願然地可以看出，供共產國際赤色帝國主義驅使的中共匪黨暴力集團造孽的結果，只能給中國人民以戰爭，不能給中國人民以和平只能給中國人民以極權的奴役，不能給中國人民以自由的權利，只能給中國人民以破壞，不能給中國人民以建設，這就是說中共給中國人民以禍亂，不能給中國人民以安甯，只能給中國人民以專制，不能給中國人民以民主，只能給中國人民以窮困，不能給中國人民以衣食，共產匪黨暴力集團的一切胡作亂爲，卽絕滅人性，自然與人生的一切正當而合理的需要，完全背道而馳，此其結果，必致淪國家民族於萬刦不服的境地！</p>
<p>更就革命的現階段的形勢來看，很　然地，中國今日只有兩條路可走：一條路是躥共產匪黨暴力集團出賣國家的領土主權，摧殘人民的自由權利，侵害人民的生命財產，使國家與人民長期陷入作附庸，受奴役與被掠奪的境地，另一條路是三民主義的革命戰士與全國上下爲保衛國家的領土主權，維護人民的自由權利與保障人民的生命財產，堅決從事反侵略，反極權，反掠奪的戰鬥，使國家的獨立生存，與人民的自由生活得以確保，同時，自然也只有兩條道路可走，一條道路是面對失敗的局勢，悲觀失望，灰心喪志，性懦畏縮，食安苟活，甘心拋棄崇高的革命理想與光榮的革命歷史，背離艱苦卓絕的革命領袖，不顧軍人報國為民的天職，甚至覥顏屈膝，投降敵人，將命運交付敵人去支配，任令共產匪黨將國家與人民長期陷入作附庸，受奴役，被掠奪的境地，另一條路是面對着失敗的教訓，嚴格檢討，切實考正，堅韌不拔，勇往直前，愈挫愈奮，再接再厲，確認反侵略，反極權，反掠奪之革命戰爭，必能獲得最後的勝利，在任何艱苦情況下，都能保持革命戰士的人格，以鋼鐵般的意志，大無畏的精神，爲爭取國家的獨立生存與人民的自由生活，與共產匪黨暴力集團週旋到底，戰鬥到底。很　然地，後一條道路是走向光榮與勝利。</p>
<p>同學同志們，在這一個最關緊要的時機，再不容許我們猶疑徘徊了，勇敢地，堅決地，站在三民主義的革命旗幟下，和千千萬萬同生死共患難的戰友們永遠緊密地團結在一起，爲反侵略，反極權，反掠奪而戰，最後的勝利終必屬於我們。</p>
<p>毫無疑問的，我們要走向光榮而勝利的道路，必須檢討過去的缺陷，提高革命的警覺，整　革命的陣容。我們相信每個人乃至每個革命戰士都有若干缺點，必先運用嚴密的組織，隨時自我批評，自我檢討，徹底反省，拿出最大的勇氣，承認錯誤，拿出最大的決心，改正錯誤，必須能夠戰勝自己，然後可以戰勝敵人。</p>
<p>今天，我們須要檢討革命戰士自己的思想，生活，行爲和作風，不容腐敗，不能落伍，尤須要檢討革命隊伍的精神，風氣與紀律，不容渙散，不容頹喪，更不容敗壞，讓已經腐敗落伍無法救要的份子，從革命的陣容中渡出去，讓投機取巧食生怕死的份子，在失敗主義的前面，被共產匪黨活埋掉。只要我們與士兵同甘苦，共安危，動則向謀，危則相救，勝不爭功，敗不諉過，只要我們能愛護人民，保護人民，駐則不驚，行則不擾，全軍士氣必可立張，全國人心必可丕振，過去失敗的恥辱必可洗刷。同時，退役在鄉的同學們，亦應認清當前嚴重的局勢，切實檢討，不悲觀失望，不怨天尤人，不走投無路，只要我們一息尚存，此志不懈，付起三民主義革命戰士應負的責任，對於破壞我們整軍復負計劃的共產匪黨作堅決殊死的　爭，只要我們肯盡力組訓人民，從事自衛，動員人力物力，支持前綫，我們過去沖鋒陷陣所得來的光榮革命歷史，決非跳樑的共產匪黨所能毀滅的。</p>
<p>革命的同學同志們！大家要提高革命的警覺，對共產匪黨肆無忌憚地提出八條廿四款形同招降書的無理要求，悍然拒絕人民與政府期求和平的願望，匪魁毛澤東並下令總攻，瘋狂渡江，且妄稱要［澈底乾淨全部殲滅國民革命軍］的陰狠企圖，要澈底認清。對潛伏在我們陣營裏動搖我們的心志，腐蝕我們的力量，和一切悲觀失望妥協投降的明或暗的在內的敵人，更要澈底的了解。對自身的種種缺失，和腐敗墮落的生活方式因循敷衍的工作方式，不相救援的戰鬥方式，尤要加以澈底的改變與糾正。認清病源所在，對準這些革命的障礙，集中堅強無比的力量，加以大舉的清掃。</p>
<p>其次，我們認為過去軍事的失敗故由於軍事本身有其失敗的缺點，但由於黨政方面不健全不進步的影響，所造成的失敗因素，較之軍事本身的缺點尤爲繁多，且非簡短的篇幅所能具述。我們大家今天有一個共同的宏願，誓以赤忱和熱血協助黨的改造，貫澈過去一切不能貫澈的政令，符合最大多數人民的最大利益的政策，得以確切推行和實施，務使我們所領導的　眾，都能切實的過着組織的生活，力求黨政的密切配合，力求政治的設施成爲黨的政策的真正表現，我們要針對這一個需要，照着這一個　的，勇往直進，促望實現與成功。</p>
<p>基於以上的認識，我們覺得我全體革命的同學同志，無論役與備役，在軍興的家鄉，實有從新組織，從新團結的必要。恢復黃埔革命的組織，發揚黃埔革命的精神，來加強革命戰鬥的力量，是我們大家今天唯一的責任，也是我們鄭重給共產黨要［澈底乾淨全部殲滅國軍］的　言一個明確而果決的答覆。革命的同學同志們！我們現在由各地來到上海的同學，以無限沉痛的心情，遙望國父的陵寐，並默念橫遭戰火的同胞，於匪首毛澤東破壞和平，下令總攻，瘋狂渡江，進逼上海的今天，在上海正式成立了中央軍事學校同學會非常委員會的組織，來團結全體革命同學，東院全體革命同學，繼續爲剿滅反革命的共產匪黨暴力集團而奮鬥到底。我們絕本總理和平奮鬥救中國的精神，誓以至誠，　其在我，來迎接共產匪黨暴力集團新的挑戰，並粉碎共產國際赤色帝國主義的赤化中國，赤化亞洲的陰謀。</p>
<p>革命的同學同志們！組織起來，團結起來，澈底消滅投機悲觀的失敗主義者，同時澈底消滅革命最後的敵人共產黨匪黨暴力集團，忠奸順逆是異常清楚的，侵略極權必然失敗，，真理正義必然勝利，是非常明白的。最後我們一致高呼：發揚黃埔精神！消滅漢奸匪黨！完成後期革命！建設中華民國！三民主義萬歲！中華民族萬歲！</p>
<h3>閻錫山在中央紀念週　報告晉作戰經過　檢討錯誤所在及個人對時局意見</h3>

<h3>空軍可阻共軍推進</h3>
<p>陳納德嘗試重振飛虎隊</p>
<p>〔聯合社香港二日電〕飛虎將陳納德現已返國，日內卽將向國會陳述援華意見，嘗試重振飛虎隊，協助中國政府作戰。惟渠返國前曾向廣州商界人士稱，渠相信中國政府倘或適當援助，仍有希望。一個空軍倘受執行轟炸與陸地掃射之特種訓練，可以制止共軍推進，使政府軍從容整編，及組織華南新防務。陳氏暗示政府一日保有西北雨西南基地，如蘭州與重慶等，則其飛虎隊一且重振，必可有效地對付共軍。</p>

<h3>兪長官署月會　張羣檢討局勢　稱決努力安定西南　強調政治革新精神</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶二日電〕張羣自就職後，二日首次主持長官公署月會，報告共黨八條廿四款不僅是要過長江的條件，實是要在全國各地成立軍事管制機構，卽川省泯江，沱江，粵珠江，滇瀾澹江，台省基隆，高雄都不能免，故目前瞻正義與抗日作戰無本質上的分別，同爲反侵略戰爭，今如再不拼命，共黨就要我們的命。惟檢討局勢，應反省及清算自己，大家要承認過去失敗的責任。和談期間，備戰謀和，彌戰求和，理論紛紜，莫衷一是，刻共黨　露真面目，渠絕對遵從四月二十二日蔣總裁·李代總統·何院長等在杭會上決議國策，努力安定西南。渠復強調政治革新精神，應力求簡單，迅速，確實三點，盼加強團結自衛自給力量，並稱美故羅斯福總統曾言，當我們知道處在何種環境中，我們就知道如何做。末面令取消星期日例假。</p>

<h3>長江中被俘八艦　經空軍炸沉六艘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：拱衛首都保衛長江的海軍江防艦隊，除永嘉等四艦於四月廿四日夜間以快速穿過江陰砲火封鎖，立卽將其疏駛於南京及采石一帶江面，傍岸淹泊，但終逃不過空軍之搜索，自四月底起，空軍出動之轟炸機隊，予以轟炸，據悉，截至五月二日止，共炸毀八艦之中六艘，餘二艘亦已受創，預計日內可全部殲滅。</p>
<p>革命的同學同志們！大家要提高革命的警覺，對共產匪黨肆無忌憚地提出八條廿四款形同招降書的無理要求，悍然拒絕人民與政府期求和平的願望，匪魁首毛澤東並下令總攻，瘋狂渡江，且妄稱要「徹底乾淨全部殲滅國民革命軍」的陰狠企圖，要徹底認清。對潛伏在我們陣營裏動搖我們的心志，腐蝕我們的力量，和一切悲觀失望妥協投降的或明或暗的內在的敵人，更要徹底了解。對自身的種種缺失，如腐敗墮落的生活方式，因循敷衍的工作方式，不相救援的戰鬥方式，尤要加以徹底的改變與糾正。認清病源所在，對準這些革命的障碍，集中堅強無比的力量，加以大舉的清掃。</p>
<p>其次，我們認爲過去軍事的失敗固由於軍事本身有其失敗的缺點，但由於黨政方面不健全不進步的影響，所造成的失敗因素，較之軍事本身的缺點尤爲繁多，且非簡短篇幅所能具述。我們大家今天有一個共同的宏願，誓以赤忱和熱血協助黨的改造，清除黨的腐惡份子，維護黨的領導權威，嚴密黨的組織，整飭黨的紀律。幷誓以赤忱和熱血擁護政府，實行政治的改革，貫徹過去一切不能貫徹的政令，符合最大多數人民的最大利益的政策，得以確切推行和實施，務使我們所領導的群衆，都能切實的過着組織的生活，力求黨政的密切配合，力求政治的設施成爲黨的政策的眞正表現，我們要針對這一個需要，照着這一個鵠的，勇往　進，促望實現與成功。</p>
<p>基於以上的認識，我們覺得我全體革命的同學同志，無論現役與備役，在軍與在鄉，實有從新組織，從新團結的必要。恢復黃埔革命的組織，發揚黃埔革命的精神，來加強革命戰鬥的力量，是我們大家今天唯一的責任，也是我們鄭重給共產黨要「徹底乾淨全部殲滅國軍」的　言一個明確而果決的答復。革命的同學同志們！我們現在由各地來到上海的同學，以無限沉痛的心情，遙望國父的陵　，並默念橫遭戰禍的同胞，於匪首毛澤東破壞和平，下令總攻，瘋狂渡江，進逼上海的今天在上海正式成立了中央各軍事學校同學會非常委員會，我們決心以同學會非常委員會的組織，來團結全體革命同學，動員全體革命同學，繼續爲剿滅反革命的共產匪黨暴力集團而奮鬥到底。我們決本總理和平奮鬥救中國的精神，誓以至誠，盡其在我，來迎接共產匪黨暴力集團新的挑戰，並粉碎共產國際赤色帝國主義的赤化中國，赤化亞洲的陰謀。</p>
<p>革命的同學同志們！組織起來，團結起來，徹底消滅投機悲觀的失敗主義者，同時徹底消滅革命最後的敵人共產黨匪黨暴力集團，忠奸順逆是異常清楚的，侵略極權必然失敗，眞理正義必然勝利，是非常明白的。最後我們一致高呼：發揚黃埔精神！消滅漢奸賊黨！完成後期革命！建設中華民國！三民主義萬歲！中華民族萬歲！</p>

<h3>社論　印度的新地位</h3>
<p>英國政府在倫敦召開的帝國聯邦總理會議閉幕後，即將於上月廿七日發表公報稱：「印度政府已通知各聯邦政府，全國人民希望印度在行將實施的新憲法下能成為一獨立自主的共和國，但仍願在聯邦之內，繼續爲聯邦的一份子；且願接受英王爲聯邦的首長」。從此，印度的法理地位，即可完全確定，印度不復有英國政府任命的總督，且不復以英國的樞密院爲其高司法機關，而將爲一獨立自主的共和國，盡在名義上承認鷹王爲其首長而已。印度新地位的確立，不能不說是印度總理尼赫魯努力的結果，國民大會黨對於此次會議圓滿結束，咸表滿意，尤其對於印度獲得新的法理地位，更加表示熱烈歡迎。英印關係的合理調整，實爲亞洲安定的一個重要因素，我們站在鄰國的地位，對於鄰國將成爲獨立自主的共和國，自應表示無限的欣慰。</p>
<p>這次會議的主題，英國召開此次會議的動機，也就是要確定印度的法理地位，是否仍在不列顛聯邦的範圍之內。所以，在此次聯邦會議開幕的前夕，印度人民固然非常關切自己祖國的命運，就是英國朝野對於未來的英印關係，也莫不予以重視。例如自由黨的「新聞紀事報」盼望應印雙方仍作有效的合作，對於防止共產勢力在亞洲造成份裂局勢所必要的。保守黨的「每日電闻報」也說，如果印度認爲必須退出聯邦，則此事對於英印雙方均屬不利。英國輿論界重視印度，亦可想見。</p>
<p>在印度方面，尼赫魯總理曾於赴英之前，向印度議會提出兩項建議：（一）承認印度人民具有雙當國籍，即同時爲印度共和國及英帝國的公民；（二）印度獨立以後與帝國繼續保持聯聚。同時，國民大會黨也會舉行秘密會議，討論印度在英帝國會議中爭取獨立的問題。據說，國大黨也有兩種不同的意見。一是主張印度——完全脫離英帝國的羈絆，成爲獨立的共和國；另一則主張印度即使實施印度共和國的新憲法，仍應參加英帝國，尼赫魯便持這個意見。</p>
<p>印度爲亞洲的大國，也是具有悠久歷史和文化的古國。印度的歷史光怪陸離，無奇不有，實爲一部舊時代的歷史；新歷史的開始，則起自一九四七年八月十五日起。就印度歷時約可分爲三段：自亞利安人移民印度產生婆羅門教，至公元三二〇年笈多王朝開始的七百年，是由原始游牧到封建皇權及教權建立時期；至公元一五二六年接巴達立據蒙古朝以後二百數十年，是封建蒙古王朝侵入印度開始封建割據時期；一七五七年普希拉戰克萊武，奠定東印度公司獨霸勢力以後，直到一九四七年，是英帝國侵略統治印度時期。在舊印度的世紀中，印度人民遭受的是壓迫，分割，剝削：雖然舊印度歷史文化的發揚，產生了許多宗教家思想家和哲學家；但他們並未能拯救印度人民。在舊印度真能爲人民奮鬥。解除英帝國束縛的革命家政治家，要算甘地，尼赫魯師徒二人。甘地的一生，爲結束舊印度而奮鬥，他赤裸裸而來，赤裸裸而去，一生光明磊落。尼赫魯的一生，也爲創立新印度而奮鬥，一九四七年八月十五日後的印度，就是在尼赫魯領導下的半獨立半自由的新印度。</p>
<p>新印度的誕生已一年半，在地位上，它只是形式上的獨立，並未獲得真正的獨立；更由於印回的分治，巴基斯坦的崛起，把整個印度分裂成兩塊，印度聯邦與巴基斯坦在英帝國「分而治之」的作用下，依然得不到自己的獨立，充其量也不過能說英帝國二百年來的通知告一段落而已。但在政治上，軍事上，尤其是在經濟上，依然受到牽絆和束縛。說到國內，尼赫魯領導下的新印度，一年半以來確乎有了若干成就，除了經濟恐慌，人民貧弱諸現象，未能予以克服外，他如新印度領土上的確定與擴張，以及新印度國際地位的提高，和他兩次召集亞洲會議的成功，無疑的，象徵新印度已成為亞洲大陸的大國了。</p>
<p>不過，這個大國迄今還有兩種苦悶：一是印度人民都希望印度能獲得真正的完全獨立。在經濟上也要不受英鎊的支配；對於後來居上的美圓勢力，尤爲恐懼，他們深慮舊的奴役尚未結果；而新的奴役又枷鎖在頭上。這是一種苦悶。其次，尼赫魯對亞洲的雄才大略，處處表現具有領導亞洲的野心，可是印度自身尚無完全獨立自由，阻撓了他雄壯的抱負。尼赫魯的思想是一種改良主義的思想，妥協性很濃厚，他躍登權位以後，處處有力不從心之感。但印度人民普遍要求獨立，連國大黨內部也有許多人要求新憲法的印度共和國，能實際成爲獨立自由的國家，尼赫魯此行的結果，仍難滿足一般印度人民的願望。</p>
<p>英帝國聯邦總理會議的召開，是大西洋公約締造後的一件大事。尼赫魯近對每日郵報記者說：如果世界大戰爆發，印度未必參戰。這表示印度對於國際戰爭的厭惡；但印度如不能獲得真正的獨立自由，則印度仍是不能避免戰爭。現在，會議已經結束，印度仍在聯邦範圍之內，尼赫魯將如何履行其諾言呢：英人稱道此次會議的圓滿結束，歸功於英相艾德禮個人的勝利，實含有深刻的意義；換句話說，英相的勝利，就是尼赫魯的失敗；印度人民對於這次會議的結果，終不免表示失望吧」？</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約二日電〕蘇聯解除柏林封鎖之日期或將於本星期內規定。美蘇代表日內再度會談時，可能成立解除封鎖協議，并訂定四外長會議日期。會期大約在月底或下月初，地點大約在巴黎。</p>

<h3>盟軍對日嚴厲軍事管制　已變爲友誼指導　麥帥在新日本誕生記念日宣布</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京二日電〕麥帥今日於日本新憲法公布二週年紀念發表聲明稱，盟國在波茨坦會議所揭　之目的，其要點多未完成，日本亦能忠勤履行其義務。盟軍所以至今未撤，並非日本之過，乃由於其無力控制外界之情形。盟軍佔領已由嚴厲之軍事管制，變為保戶勢力之友誼指導。此過渡時期將隨日本担負自治責任之能力而繼續迅速進展。惟日人應嚴防不信人類智慧，妨書個人尊嚴，及嚴制個人自由之槪念侵變。此爲新日本誕生之二週紀念，須知人類目的，未有較保衛憲法賦予之權力最大者，日本於此當可確保其安靜，而有秩序之進步。</p>
<h3>耶城南猶軍　完成軍事行動</h3>

<h3>羅維特請美參院外委會　批准大西洋公約　挪威冰島參加並并遭受壓力</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓二日廣播：前任副國務卿羅維特在參院外委會中稱：挪威冰島等小國加入北大西洋公約，均係出於自動請求，否認大國曾對其施用壓力。渠指出該約對於美國安全與世界和平絕對需要，　請外委會批准該約。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓二日電〕前任國務卿羅維特本日將出席參院外交委員會，發表其關於北大西洋條約之意見。此次將未公開聽取意見之第四日。第一次開始係在上星期三，當時由國務卿艾契遜作證，聽取意見之時期，預料將達數星期之久。在此時期內，該委員會將聽取對該防禦公約支持者及反對者雙方之意見。一般預料：陸軍參謀長勃拉特萊將軍，前任陸長伯德遜及其他人等均將在本週內發表意見，贊成此項公約，同時發表反對之證言者將包括華萊士在內。當被邀出席者均已發表其意見之後，外交委員會將舉行秘密會議並草擬一項報告。於是該條約將提交參院全會加以辯論，並採取最後之行動。該條約必須在參院內獲得三分之二多數之通過，然後方對美國發生約束之效力。勃拉特萊將軍將被請發表如何以軍事援助補充該公約之方法，在上週聽取意見之時，國務卿艾契遜及國防部長約翰遜均曾評論建議中之軍火援助計劃。北大西洋公約以及建議中之對締約國家之軍事援助方案，在委會討論中雖有關聯，但此二者，仍需個別之立法行動。北大西洋公約，僅需參院之批准。軍事援助方案，尚待正式提交國會，此一方案尚需參眾兩院採取行動，並撥發款項。目前委會正就批准大西洋公約事聽取意見，此外並將聽取軍事援助方案。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕全世界各地之工會領袖及工人，於今日一齊慶祝五一勞動節，柏林西區，曾因警察之阻止工人，赴東區參加慶祝會，而發生衝突。東區各國，均舉行遊行閱兵等盛大儀式。史達林元帥循例在紅場，檢閱軍隊及工人一百萬人生大行列之遊行，渠在列甯墓頂，站立數小時之久，精神健旺，笑容可掬，天空有最新式之蘇聯飛機翱翔表現內有噴射推進飛機三架。柏林西區之事件，起因於美當局之祗許反共系總工會在美區內遊行，有一部份工人，擬通過美區往蘇區參加示威，彼警察用棍棒驅逐，受傷者數人。在柏林蘇區之自由廣場內，集會之工人達數萬人。荷蘭阿姆斯徳丹，有四萬五千人舉行五一節慶祝大會，該會係由荷蘭共產黨所主持。羅馬尼亞京城舉行三十萬人之大示威，旗幟及口號中最引人注意的是辭句卽爲和平二字。奧斯陸挪威黨及共黨聯合舉行空前大遊行，未有不幸事件發生，共黨人員所携旗幟，多針對杜魯門邱吉爾及大西洋公約。貝爾格萊特工農婦孺等十萬人，遊行經過狄托元帥之前，行列經七小時始行畢。狄托穿白色元帥禮服，站於司令台上，台上懸巨大紅星標誌及巨幅史達林，列甯，馬克斯安格爾諸氏肖像。巴黎今日竟畢乎轉常的寂靜，由於大部份工人均於是日休息一天。</p>
<h3>美裁撤中太平洋　空軍司令部</h3>
<p>驅逐與轟炸機全部他調</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕太平洋中部之空防，下月起將完全依賴海軍航空隊及海軍陸戰隊航空隊。空軍部近日宣布，太平洋空軍司令部將於六月一日起裁撤，該司令部兩年來逐漸縮小範圍，至今僅剩少數運輸對與驅逐機一隊約七十五架。此種剩餘部隊撤回本國後，空軍在中太平洋卽不留一架驅逐機與轟炸機。今後最近之重大基地爲關島，其他部隊則以日本，沖繼與菲律賓爲基地。同時，海軍中心亦自太平洋轉移，歐洲居士正使大西洋戰略具有新價值。海軍戰士在太平洋駐有兵艦數百艘，目前已減至九十六艘，海岸兵站亦隨之減少。現有艦隊計爲航空母艦五艘（二七，〇〇〇順愛塞克斯級兩艘，一四，五〇〇順輕航空母艦三艘），中太平洋空防卽全靠此五艘航空母艦上之驅逐機及轟炸機隊。五艦共載飛機約三百架，由海軍航空隊與海軍陸戰隊航空隊司令部指揮。除航空母艦外，太平洋艦隊尚有巡洋艦六艘，驅逐艦與驅逐保衛艦五十三艘及潛水艇三十二艘。太平洋行空軍司令部飛徹後，該區空軍運輸部，將併入海空軍混合組織之「軍事空運勤務部。」</p>
<h3>解散德工業　成就與倫比</h3>
<p>克萊答覆調查國指實</p>
<p>〔聯合社德國弗朗克福一日電〕德境美國軍事總督克萊，今日向陸軍部提出報告書，答覆調查國關於德境美當局未解散德國大工商業組織之指責。克萊稱，解散德國大工商業，成就大無與倫比。吾人曾發出解散大工業組織之通告一千一百餘起。德國之高度集中金融制度已被摧毀，代以分化之制度，與美國之聯邦準備制度相似，其各分行之活動範圍亦受限制。</p>
<h3>美解散德工業　進行極遲緩</h3>
<p>因與軍政府計劃相左</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓二日電〕據美陸長羅雅爾十年十二月所委任之調查委員會最後報告：美國在德國解散工業同盟之計劃，確爲一種健全之政策，但其結果則殊爲落後。此一甫經發表之報告，提出十二項建議，以改善解散工業同盟之計劃。該報告稱：此項計劃落後之原因如下：（一）德國境內之蘇聯當局採取不合作之態度；（二）英國對於整個計劃缺乏熱誠；（三）美當局優先考慮促進德國之經濟復興而忽視其工業之分化。調查委員會之報告，爲說明上述三項建議起見，追述該委員會與美軍總督克萊將軍，對於構成區　活動之兩大工廠應如何處置一點，彼此各抱不同意見。其中一廠爲亭斯契爾火車頭工廠，專為政府所有之鐵路系製造機頭。克萊將軍，感覺運輸機陷於停頓之狀態，故採取審慎之態度，歷史化分行動，以便維持亭斯契爾公司之生產。同樣的，克萊特軍認爲德國唯一之鋼珠製造廠，對於恢復德國之經濟一事，至爲重要。該三人委員會之報告，現正由陸軍部助理部長伏希斯在研究中。該委員會之委員三人聯邦貿易局長福開森（主席）紐約市律師伊塞克斯及芝加哥資方顧問基亞奈。該三人集團去年十二月在德國曾以數星期之時間從事於研究。伏希斯對此項報告作初步之研究後，卽指出一點，此卽委員會在任務乃在研究德國工業非集中化以及德國同業同盟解散之計劃，而克萊將軍則須使同業同盟解散之計劃必須與德國經濟復興之迫切需要相配合，此項工作固甚困難者。</p>
<h3>愛爾蘭前總理　盼難背愛統一　希望英結束愛分裂狀態</h3>

<p>艾德禮強調共黨四大自由</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕艾德禮首相暨其他工黨領袖，今日在五一節之演說中，已約略透露一九五〇年共黨之競選計劃。艾德禮在諾維樞之政治集會中致辭，強調共黨以四大自由爲其信條，卽言論及思想自由，選擇政府之自由，個人免受強者壓迫的自由及個人免受少數人經濟專暴壓迫的自由，今日的自由懸念已非舊時個人主義者所主張的自由，由個人任意爭取主宰權，祗有在有組織的社會中，使盲目的經濟勢力，受到爲公眾利益的控制，始能有真正的自由。艾德禮並強調英人在社會保險制度下所受的利益。並曰：此項制度已引起美國樞大的興趣，杜魯門總統亦擬發起類似的計劃。</p>

<h3>戴高樂借題發揮　猛烈抨擊法政府之對德政策　呼籲共同建立另一政權</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎一日電〕戴高樂將軍今日向「法國人民集團」作五一節　眾大會演說稱：「共黨正在建立歷史上最大之帝國」，彼攻擊法國政府散佈可恥之樂觀空氣，且對法國人民使用可羅芳麻醉劑。並謂目前之政府乃「一隊中庸份子」。且猛烈抨擊法政府之對德政策爲「傾向成立第四個德意志共和國，且屈服於英美之對德政策，而放棄法國之傳統政策，此傳統政策，爲將德國各邦與魯爾區併入真正之歐洲聯邦中」。戴氏呼籲人民集團會員協助其改換此使人不滿之法國政權，且與其共同建立另一政權，實行大多數人支持之意見。述及國防問題時，戴高樂謂，法國應建立一適當之國防部隊，足以在防衛歐洲之工作上担任有效之任務。戴氏繼宣稱：大西洋公約對法國在受攻擊時可獲之實際軍事援助，仍頗含糊。且抨擊盟國之戰略，將英國作爲歐洲防衛之主要壁　，而非法國。彼又攻擊法國現政府謂：「目下之政府隨波逐流」。戴高樂在結束時謂：「吾人需要再度確立全國之統一，而尤需先恢復國家之威權，此乃人民集團之唯一目標」。</p>
<h3>從艾契遜看美國外交</h3>
<p>— 哈許作</p>
<p>譯自「基督教科學箴言報」</p>
<p>現在美國的外交政策將移轉其重點與方向，究竟按何種方法，到底何種程度？由於杜魯門總統的接受他的兩位國務院最高官員馬歇爾與羅維特的辭職，並任命艾契遜與魏勃繼任，成了一連串事件的頂點，全世界每一國的首部與外交機關大槪都在沉思這個問題。但是要不是有下列這些別的事情，國務院人事的更動，並不能是問題如此突出與如此迫切要求了解。</p>
<p>在總統嚴選期間，杜魯門的言論一似他確信他日後有辦法與蘇聯獲致一個合理地滿意的和平。隨總統競選專事充任演詞擬稿人的專欄作家弗蘭克林，在十一月廿九日預言政府政策講完擺脫他所稱「貝爾納斯——馬希爾——福萊斯特」計劃。這篇專欄文章曾被總統所否認。可是在十二月二十七日，杜魯門又宣佈他的意見說，與蘇聯之間的和平有可能，他決定以他以後四年的任期來設法覓致。他又補充他的看法說，克林姆內部黨意見有分歧，它有些領袖要和平。</p>
<p>一月初高潮出現。富蘭克林又在一種　著的公眾讀物上，寫了一篇專欄，這次是在「生活」雜誌。可是杜魯門又一度否認富蘭克林的估計，卽杜魯門已一反過去，將使美國外交政策向蘇友善這方面一個激烈的轉變。但十分可靠而消息靈通的專欄作家李普曼，他認為富蘭克林的說法不值得重視，並說，美國的經濟並不依循克林姆外交政策所依據的殺條或理論的方針，不過他獲有證據證實杜魯門所說克林姆內部有分歧的說法，他作了下述的觀察：</p>
<p>「在我看來，總統的直覺認爲對整個衝突（西方與蘇聯之間的衝突）應作重新估計·檢討·與再考慮的努力，外交上的僵局應以積極措施設法打破，正好說明歐洲的情勢與西方社會的遠景」。</p>
<p>此後就發生了馬歇爾國務卿的辭職，與艾契遜受命繼任的事情，這些事情的意義是什麽？據我看來，福蘭克林不但把意義看簡單了，而且又過分誇張了。首先，艾契遜曾在馬歇爾手下當過副國務卿，而且與他合作的最稱和洽。其次，艾契遜是杜魯門主義與馬歇爾計劃提出建議的主動者。因此，由馬歇爾改變艾契遜這一人事更動，並不能就意味政治的激烈變動。艾契遜的政績已可作爲前奏，掩盜下列任何有力假定，卽他可能「對蘇和緩」或有「綏靖」的傾向。將美國軍事設備與顧問送到希臘，協助攻打共產主義，並發動成為對莫斯科的詛咒的馬歇爾計劃的人，決不能希望共推翻上述這些行動中所包含的全部方針。</p>
<p>在我看來，重點與意義存在於比較更複雜的微妙之處。自然，改變尚在未定之天，但是我願意說，改變並非來自一種業已改變的情緒上的感覺，或任何一反過去的希望，而正像李普曼的看法，係來自下列事實，卽影響外交政策的基本局勢在變動中，因此政策應爲適應這種變化而調整。福蘭克林認爲「貝爾納斯——馬歇爾——福萊斯特政策」是壞東西，因此現在該放棄了。我所得到的消息是杜魯門與艾契遜已獲致同意，並共同參與擬定爲時局所引致的政策。這政策代表一種在這個戰後復蘇的時期，保護西方社會的必要策略，也代表着美國外交藉以獲得時機，以重建其對付共產主義與蘇維埃擴張這一戰後勢力的應付力。因此，如果政策有變更的話，變更並非過去是錯的這種了解的結果，而是一種估計的結果。這估計認爲政策多半爲達成其重建西方應付力的目的，而時機也已接近，卽新的應付力可能用以推動蘇聯朝向減輕強權鬥爭的新的合理態度。</p>
<p>我還認爲馬歇爾體力，能夠繼任他國務部的職務，這同一變更也可能發生的，換句話說，這種情形並非是一種政策的變化，而是貝爾納斯——馬歇爾時期政策和邏輯的發展。哪是期政策決非僅僅以「對蘇強硬」爲目的，而只是爲達到西方力量加強到足與蘇聯獲取一個對西方安全而有利的解決手段。</p>
<p>但是在所有這些促成變化的事項中，有若干附帶的因素。按馬歇爾國務卿是美國大戰時期最解除與最有勢力的軍事人物，而羅維特是由陸軍部轉任副國務卿的。艾契遜是個非軍籍的律師。繼羅維特的魏勃曾任預算局主任，這以前是一位協助國會議員的非軍籍的律師。其次，魏勃在當預算局主任時，曾於杜魯門堅持軍事預算一百五十億數字而反對爲軍部所力爭的二百卅億元時的作用不小。</p>
<p>因此今後國務與國防兩部間的界綫於外交的影響勢將減少，艾契遜與魏勃兩人的獲得委任，都由於在他們任官期間對於白宮權威的小心順從，在貝爾納斯主持的國務部，貝氏最後與杜魯門的關係漸趨緊張。其時艾契遜是副國務卿，他對於貝爾納斯負責，甚爲恭順，但也力求免於任何越過杜魯門的指責。</p>
<p>因此，這事情另一種含義，是白宮對外交政策將更多直接的控制了。在馬歇爾主持國務部期間，杜魯門曾將外交政策的事情，完全託付于馬歇爾，而現在他是在高級職位上，佈置一些順從他的意見而可望作他自己主張的執行者的人了。</p>
<p>杜魯門今後還有四年任期，並無急急忙忙之必要，他具有從容施政的時間。他相信現在的時機是在設法減輕強權的鬥爭，自然他是會利用這種時機的。至於採用什麽方法那是問題，當然杜魯門不會比艾契遜更主張「綏靖」的。</p>

<h3>房建捐營業稅　財局調整施行　市府公敎薪津明後發放</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市房捐市政建設捐，捐率調整辦法，前經市府提出市參議會審查後，除「分等加成」辦法取消外，餘均照案通過，並已於五月一日起開征。記者特走訪財政局錢局長，承告此次房建捐之調整，乃因幣値貶低過劇，原有捐額微小，不但不夠征收費用，且納稅人亦無同額鈔劵可以繳納，社會輿論與市民來函，均譏笑備至。財政局職責所在，原應從早辦理，祇因稅收調整，必須經過市參議會之通過，數月休會期間，經濟情况完全改變，勢已不能再延，故由市府促請提早開會，俾能從速通施行。至原定「分等加成」辦法，原係减輕一般市民之負担，而使有產者及生活享受愈高者，愈能多納稅捐，茲旣經民意機關撤消，自應遵照辦理。其餘調整要點，約為（一）自夏季起，改為按月征收。（二）以卅七年秋季捐額作為今後房建捐之納稅基數。（三）以開征前月最後期之職工指數（卽計薪指數）乘算，卽為應納捐額。（四）本年春季房建捐，卽照四月份月底指數乘算，與四月份併收。</p>
<p>再者，本市營業稅之調整，亦經審議委員會於上星期六日下午開會商討，當經議決（一）自本年夏季起，營業稅亦改為按月征收。（二）以卅七年秋季捐額，作為今後營業稅之納稅基數。（三）照開征前月最後一日之物價指數乘算基數，卽為應納稅額。（四）限送達日起五日內照繳，逾限一日，卽照最近期生活指數調整其原稅額征收，並加收百分之五罰鍰。照此類推，與「複息」計算方式同。房建捐之處罰辦法，亦同此辦理。</p>
<p>地價稅調整辦法，亦經參議會修正通過，實施日期，另由地政局決定。至市府原提之「汽油銷售捐征收辦法」，則已保留。</p>
<p>最近物價高昂，公敎人員生活清苦，關於公敎指數，中央昨已發表為十萬倍，本市公敎待遇何時發放，當為市府所屬最關心之問題，茲亦經探悉，是項經費，連同補發四月份及預發五月份估計，共需陸千億餘元，財政局正竭力籌措中，大約明後日卽可照發云。</p>

<p>又該公司昨循例開紗，開出四十支日光一種，開價九億二千萬元，僅一戶報價請購，惟報價低於開價，結果並未成交。</p>
<h3>社局門前長蛇陣　兼營銀元商店　登記者極踴躍　首批許可證八日前辦完</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀元買賣自經警備部嚴格規定須先領許可證後始能營業，日來各商店兼營銀元買賣者，前往社會局登記，至為踴躍·昨日社局門前排成一字長蛇陣，每份申請書五萬元，第一批三千份申請書昨日下午業已發完，商人塡報送局後，隨卽核發許可證，每天可發出許可證六百份，星期日照常辦公，預計本月八日前可以辦完，自九日起卽會同軍警嚴格檢查，無照營業者予以取締。第二批五千份申請書繼之開始登記分發，辦法略有更動，每份改收登記費二十五萬元，原需貼照片兩張者予以取消，僅憑各該商店之商業登記證卽可申請，有舖面而無商業登記證者，須由業已登記之商店代出證明書，證明該舖面具有五十銀元以上之資本金，如發現黃牛假冒商店名義前往申請者，查出後予以嚴懲。至攤販或個人在馬路旁買賣銀元者，則須向警察局申請，社會局不予處理。</p>
<h3>銀元供源見旺　馬路喊價步低</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元市况，因當局公佈嚴令買賣銀元，必需辦理登記，領有執照，否則查出，除銀元沒收外，並取消身份證，驅逐出境，一般商號，咸具戒心。馬路銀牛，亦不敢明目張胆，大聲呌喊，買氣轉淡。因央行公佈，四百萬對一，廠方多折發銀元，以致供過於求，袁大頭，上午在一片賣出聲中，曾小至三〇〇萬，三五〇萬。瀕午稍升至三三〇萬，三六〇萬，三七〇萬，大多只出勿進，脚地頗虛。本票交易，大頭曾小至四〇〇萬，四五〇萬，最後喊五〇〇萬，六〇〇萬。</p>
<h3>華股場內漲停　塲外喊價微軟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股市况，塲內昨日各　　開均告漲停，迄午無賣出，全日未有成交。塲內永紗　開六七〇元登限後，其他各股亦均以停板價開出。計新光二三元二角，景福一二元五角，勤興一四元五角，美亞一四元三角，其餘各股均升二成。塲外暗盤加碼走勢先堅後軟，　金銀回跌，人心趨軟。永紗塲外讓售喊價初喊合二七，二九元，繼卽小至二五元，二七元。新光美亞等照碼加一成半有求，但執戶仍多不放。後市塲內仍照限度依然未見開板，亦無成交。惟因銀根趨勢轉緊，人心稍疲，各股喊價微較前市回降。</p>
<p>金債漲停</p>
<p>黃金公債　開一三一三萬三千元買進，卽登限度，直至午收仍無賣出，全日亦僅喊價，未有成交，午後仍照漲限收市。</p>
<h3>連日上漲過猛　金市昨已回瀉</h3>
<p>較上週最高價軋降七八成</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市况，已成軟化，較上週未之最高峯，軋降七八成左右，因連日上漲過猛，與銀元脫節甚遠，居高思危，各方紛紛出籠，出金進鈔者，頗不乏人，塲外現貨，開盤三億五，四億，一路瀉至二億三，二億八，頻午稍升至三億一，三億四。午後買賣均稀，交易清淡，曾高至三億五，三億八，最後以三億二，三億七收盤。</p>
<p>美鈔塲外跌勢尚緩，因盛傳北方美鈔三對一，人心安定，散戶去化活絡，晨開七五〇萬，八〇〇萬，曾小至五〇〇萬，五五〇萬，午收六三〇萬，六八〇萬。午後升至七〇〇萬，七五〇萬，最後以六八〇萬，七三〇萬收盤。較上日軋跌七〇萬。馬路大頭掉美鈔，做高至七元八角，八元三角。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀樓節金掛牌仍未恢復，大部銀樓均已暫停營業，整日未見開門。錢兌業亦無買賣，馬路交易稍有做開，喊價為二億五進，三億出。</p>
<p>證交大樓金銀交換比例，升降倐忽，大頭初做三八，四一，一路小至三五，三八，午後再低至三四，三七收盤。</p>
<p>馬路鎳幣交易頗為旺盛，聞青島方面，一元鎳幣，可合一塊大頭，單帮搜求甚力，廿分鎳幣喊十二萬，十五萬。十分喊六萬，八萬。五分喊三萬，五萬。</p>
<h3>食米稍見上升</h3>
<p>麵粉去化特旺趨勢堅挺</p>
<p>米市略見挺升，到貨稀少，人心尚定，故出戶較少，北市塲白粳折合銀元五元六角，略漲一角，以四百萬折合為二千二百四十萬元，較上週六漲一千萬元，薄稻五元五角。南市塲白粳五元，薄稻五元二角，與上週六彷彿，早稻升一角，以四百萬折合金圓券，計白粳二千萬，薄稻二千〇八十萬，早稻一千九百二十萬。</p>
<p>食油價格先平後升，因本街實銷尚活，紛向市上補取，市勢俏俐，豆油現鈔價五千四至五千七百萬元，生菜油四千二百至四千六百五十萬元，生油四千五百萬至五千一百萬，折合銀元，豆油十八元，生菜油十五元五角，生油十六元，各漲一元五角至二元。豆餅仍未開。</p>
<p>百物回跌聲中，麵粉獨見堅挺，良以鈔荒解決，銀元交易旺盛，市勢欣欣向榮，老車初開四百廿萬，中途本街去化特暢，一度竄出五百萬，後市貨主逢高有吐，回做四百五十萬，兵船　開三百六十萬，中市高做四百廿萬，臨收以三百九十萬成交，較上週六挺升二成。麩皮大包福新三百六十萬，折合銀洋一元二角。</p>
<h3>棉布塲內依然停頓　場外喊價盤挫</h3>
<p>棉布塲內仍無做開，各方人心穩定，國外物價由堅趨疲，塲外喊價物物交換者，自四元二角盤旋降至三元九角許，最後四君子　嘰及龍頭細布，大致每疋同以二千萬金圓券有授受，塲內始終無成交，民營廠盤　續調整，高檔士林挺升至五五〇〇萬，大明府綢三千元，再各軋升一成之譜</p>
<h3>棉紗去銷轉弱</h3>
<p>棉紗昨日交易清稀，人心沉寂，　國外物價均軟，廠方亦頻有開售，去銷轉滯，廿一支　馬現貨喊做七三〇〇〇萬，棧單六六〇〇〇萬，較上週六挫落二千萬，四十二支藍鳳退至一一四〇〇〇萬，亦小八四〇〇萬，據開以上價格，均係隨金價之升落折合</p>

<p>今日續有乙組三塲交綏</p>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽，前晚甲組綢白對壘郵務，臨時改在郵務球室舉行，郵務嚴陣以待，聲勢甚壯，綢白健兒陸續從精總球室趕來參戰，精神良佳。兩軍接觸之下，郵務小將王傳耀初生之犢不畏虎，以直落二擊敗綢白隊長楊昌熙，次組楊昌嘉又遭郵務抽手姜春山之毒手，綢白連失兩關，軍情緊急，第三組郵務主將劉造時出戰綢白孔漢臣，造時為全材好手，曾被選滬聯隊代表，孔雖為老將，已屬落伍人物，　料造時必勝無疑，焉知孔老將氣不稍餒，沉着抗戰，抽球異常穩健，擊來得心應手，似得神助，造時亞運臨頭，竟告不支，以零對二敗陣。繼之綢白翁叔恒亦乘機猛攻，極見出色，郵務胖將莊坤榮力進不退，兩人劇鬥三局，分數至為接近，莊以未能鎭靜，終告失利。綢白賴孔翁之意外成功，扳成各二平手，末組決戰綢白否極泰來，谷生輝亡命反攻，一路領先，郵務老將王惠章屢失可勝之機會，久戰之下，長力不濟，谷遂以二對零　捷，結果綢白起死回生，以三對二反敗為勝，可謂險矣。今日（三日）續有乙組三塲角逐，茲探錄兩隊戰績及今日秩序如下：</p>

<h3>察蒙巡禮</h3>
<p>〔西北通訊〕察蒙地方的南部是察哈爾部共有入旗一處（正藍·正白，廂黃，廂白，明安，商都太　寺左右旗及多倫喇嘛印務處）人口只有三萬一千三百一十九人·在北部的是錫林郭勒盟，錫蒙原來只擁有十旗，（東，西蘇尼特，東，西阿巴，東，阿巴哈那爾，東，西浩齊特，東，西烏球穆沁）至民國十年原來任在外蒙的布里亞特民族，因為外蒙受蘇聯的煽動而「革命」了，於是這一　寫信佛敎的布里亞特人就由外蒙流浪到錫盟的庫倫貝爾，至民國十八年始遷到西浩齊特和東巴的交界處。迄至民國十九年班禪至察，為布里亞特向中央請准為旗，所以現在的錫林郭勒盟共有十一旗。人口總數五萬四千二百八十六人。</p>
<p>塞外察蒙地勢平坦，清溪綠野形成一片天然地大草原，在這廣闊的草原上，孕育著無數生命，大隊的牛羣，羊羣，馬羣和駝羣，在草原上奔馳追逐，牧童躺在草原上撫弄他手中的皮鞭，牧馬者騎在馬背上揚鞭疾馳，繞著馬羣巡視，倦時，也躺在草原上休息，哼著女孩子們習唱的「等郞來」情歌，一幅大自然的美麗畫面，只有在塞外的草原上才能欣賞得到，也惟有在塞外的草原上才能描繪出這自然的畫面。</p>
<p>蒙民居住並無城市，較大部落亦不多見，通常不過四五戶十餘戶而已，每村相距數里至數十里不等，錫蒙各旗有少數王公喇嘛及有產階級，其住屋為磚木建築，其他人民均住活動之蒙古包，隨水草而遷徙，每隔數日或十數日卽需遷移。飲食以乳茶牛羊肉類及米麵雜糧為主，尤其以乳茶為每日不可缺乏的飲料，乳茶的製法是以磚茶煮煎，茶中摻牛乳或　，味夾甜鹹，飲之如沁泉，再用牛羊乳製成黃油奶豆腐等，雜以妙米用乳茶冲飲，每日飲兩三次不等，並用牛馬乳造酒，作待客及日常飲料，煮飯或冬日取暖均用牛糞或羊馬駝糞，間或取用柳條及乾枯木料，不過主要的燃料還是以牛糞為主。</p>
<p>衣着方面，夏季以棉布製衣，貴族用綢緞。袖長而身闊，冬季用羊皮及各種獸皮製衣，在色彩上，喇嘛多用紅黃兩色，其他各級人士着灰藍青等色，在腰間均紮有各色的綢布腰帶，在腰帶左右兩側挿入旱煙袋，鼻煙壺，餐刀，燧石，項帶，佛像，足登香皮或布製之靴，婦女則好用金銀所製頭帶，四周鑲以珊瑚，珍珠，綴以瓔珞垂向左右兩方，以為裝飾，此種頭帶價値甚昂，構造式樣各旗不同，未出閣閨女只帶耳環，不帶其他飾物。</p>
<p>蒙胞結婚年齡，男女均在十八歲左右，卽舉行婚禮新婦年齡通常小於新郞二三歲，婚姻之成立，不必男女同意，槪依父母之命媒妁之言，由男方請出媒人向女方妥商聘禮，雙方承認以後，男方餽贈女家少許衣物，而女家陪送嫁粧頭飾衣物甚巨，婚期前夕，由雙方各請男女親友，聚集宴會，並請出男家一人為領袖，負責指導婚禮，次日，新郞背弓帶箭，裝束如騎士，有伴郞二人作陪（一兄一弟）及來賓多人，各騎駿馬至女家，屆時，由女家親友排列門前迎接來賓，互行啓安禮，　至室內，再互換鼻烟壺（禮節之一種）請安及敬酒禮，各種禮節進行後始入席就坐，酒過三巡，新郞伴郞及來賓至室內禮佛，再至新娘屋中舉行合巹禮，桌上放著整羊一盤，由新郞新娘將羊腿之一部筋骨拉斷後，卽出外乘馬，圍繞所設之香爐行三匝後再請新郞進屋入席，席終卽同原來親友伴郞等馳回家宅，再由女家親友將新娘送至男家（騎馬，乘轎，坐車均可）由請來之義父，領新夫婦叩拜天地灶君，新娘在拜罷天地灶君後，卽重新梳頭改飾婦裝出拜翁姑，禮佛拜像，再拜親友，三日後女家親友携帶禮品看望新娘，一週內新夫婦返娘家認親。</p>
<p>至於離婚極其簡便，無任何形式及手續，如雙方因意見不合實難同居時，只需一方提出離婚理由，經夫婦同意，隨時可向女家說明理由，着其將女兒領回，或由男方派人送去，如此卽宣告離婚，假如已育有子女，多數留於夫家，如係乳兒不能離母時，經男方商給婦方養育物資，如牛馬等，將來此孩長大，多有男歸父女歸母之習慣。</p>

<h3>台州漁產之一：松門白鯗</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員　李聽波</p>
<p>〔本報溫嶺廿八日訊〕松門是台州漁產市塲之一，松門的白鯗，亦是台州特產的之一種，馳名遐邇，和金華火腿相媲美，因為在松門一帶所產的黃魚，肥鮮味美，所以白鯗亦能負盛名，又因醃製得法，色澤香味，均較他處所產的白鯗為佳，但產量額每年漸漸减落，在戰前的產量，每年有五六萬斤，運銷為杭州·上海·南京·天津·漢口·福州·及兩廣·魯·豫·湘·川等地，年來因漁業的衰疲，漁民捕魚守舊，器具簡陋，又加物價不斷的飛漲，漁民生活困苦，無法整理和修茸，添造，所以產量亦大見减低，每年僅祇三四萬斤。</p>
<p>製鯗方法漁民在潮汛時期，捕得新鮮黃魚後，卽在漁船上，或在鄰近小島上，劈成鯗胚，劈法用小利刃，將黃魚，自頭部直剖至距魚尾的四寸處，然後將魚背略灣曲，取出腹內臓腑，分開再略加壓平，繼用多量鹽斤，一個一個的醃製，經過一兩天後，取出洗淨，放在稻草上，任烈日陽光照射猛晒，如天不下雨，可以不必收回，任受夜露水，滋味更鮮，經晒四五天之後，卽可裝篰，運銷為各地。</p>
<p>白鯗特點因為馳名遐邇的松門白鯗，當然和他處所產的白鯗不同，是有特點的，所謂白鯗，並非完全白色，白鯗的特點，是胸鰭全部，合併向後，密貼於腹部，尾鰭亦不分歧，全身細鱗，顏色有光澤，除腹部胸鰭，尾鰭，略呈黃金色外，其餘均呈灰白色，仔細去看那黃金色發出微微的光亮，滋味鮮美，膾炙人口，當煮豆腐羹時，放幾片白鯗肉，則滋味更鮮，而各地所產和染色假冒，鱗片決不發光，滋味，色澤，各別，胸鰭和尾鰭，也都不同。</p>
<p>貯藏簡單貯藏方法，頗為簡單，（一）挖去魚眼，因為白鯗的霉爛，均起於魚眼，而及全身，將好好一個魚鯗，全部發紅，而至滋味全失，（二）晒乾貯藏前，應將充分晒乾，晒時須將無鱗的腹面，向太陽晒，（三）貯藏的地方，應少通室氣，最宜為乾燥，因為魚鯗中，含鹽分甚多，如果放在溫度高的地方，極易發生潮濕變色，而至霉爛，最好將魚鯗貯藏在穀倉，或麥樞中，是不會壞的，因為乾燥的穀，和麥，都能吸收濕氣，故雖有高的溫度，也不致受影響會變壞的。</p>
<p>出產時期白鯗出產時期，整年都有，其品質最佳良，首推是伏鯗，「秋伏是一個節候在農曆七月初至月半前後」，而伏鯗，又有初伏，二伏·三伏·之分，品質以三伏為最佳，三伏時候，黃魚能吃到松門沿海的水，故特別肥嫩，滋味特別鮮美，所製的白鯗也就特別的出名，因為這時候，天氣乾燥，陽光猛烈，使白鯗容易晒乾，所以晒製白鯗，還要靠天氣的。</p>
<h3>青滬輸運價調整</h3>
<p>〔中央社青島二日電〕青市輪船業公會一日起調整客貨運費，新價如次：青滬綫客票特等十八元一，頭等十二元二，貨運每噸九元五，機帆船每噸八元五，青島至福州，基隆綫，客票特等卅六元七，頭等廿四元四，貨運每噸十一元七。</p>
<p>〔中央社青島二日電〕此問綏區通令各航運機關，宜保持常態，不得藉故撤離，各綫航運雖在萬難中，亦必須繼續維持，所有空運狀况，亦應按以前之規定，隨時具報。</p>
<h3>崇明魚汛　漁船滿載</h3>
<p>〔本報崇明廿八日訊〕本年魚汛，只有堡鎭港施翹河開放。頭汛駛赴黃海中撈捕黃花魚的漁船，已陸續歸來。近月戰局激變，人家都躭心着海面的秩序，初不料反比過去平靖。據說海盜不能在黃海立足，已轉進到別處去了，漁船上帶的一大筆「太平錢」居然完璧歸趙。可是幣値狂跌，雖未送給海盜，却已打了一個很大的折扣，漁夫們跑上岸來問問貨價，嚇得目瞪口呆</p>
<p>每年魚汛，向有兩次。去年頭汛方過，突來春雷，漁夫們說春雷一響，黃花魚潛入深海，無法撈捕，因此去年二汛，空船而回。這許多漏綱之魚，優哉遊哉，多活了一年。今年頭汛，魚　格外豐富，加以漁船站洋時風平水緩，容易下綱，所以各綱船都滿載而歸。</p>
<p>崇明人愛吃黃花魚，吃法非常講究，把魚洗淨曬乾，醃入甜糟，久藏不壞，甜香而鮮美，一聞其味，垂涎欲滴，所以漁船一到，大家小戶都得買上幾十斤幾百斤不等。過去啓東人也雇了小船到崇明來批回去賣，港邊人山人海，擠得水洩不通。可是今年魚汛，情形大變，不但啓東人絕跡，卽本地人也因銀根奇緊，而望魚興嘆。漁戶們幾經商討，只好實行物物交換，一籌魚（約二十多斤），兌十四支紗三絞，或花衣三斤，這樣一來，總算打開了僵局。</p>
<p>頭汛黃花魚兌完後，廿八九號便可開始去黃海趕二汛了。</p>

<h3>The Emergency Committee of Military Academy Alumni Issues a Letter to All Military Academy Alumni</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this newspaper dispatch] The "Emergency Committee" established by alumni of central military schools held a meeting yesterday (May 2nd). It conducted specific discussions on important committee affairs and action guidelines, and passed and issued a "Letter to All Military Academy Alumni." The full text is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Revolutionary comrades:</p>
<p>What day is this? The great and arduous national revolutionary cause has been constantly attacked and undermined by the Chinese Communist bandit party, and it has reached an extremely serious juncture. The fruits of victory, won with countless sacrifices of blood, are being sacrificed under the expansionist politics and aggressive policies of the Communist International. It incites the Chinese Communist bandit party's violent group to extinguish humanity, betray the motherland, trample on human rights, and ruin the nation and people. It has brought the 5,000 years of cultural history to the brink of destruction, and has plunged the nation, the people, and the masses into a dangerous and dark period. The crimes of the Communist bandit party in China over the past 20 years, including uprisings, struggles, murder, and arson, are well known and need not be listed. Just look at how the Chinese Communist Party helped the Red imperialists dismantle various industrial and mining equipment in the Northeast that had been squeezed out of the Chinese people over the past 50 years, with a value of over 2 billion US dollars, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Recently, the bandit leader Mao Zedong, in order to show loyalty to his foreign masters, shouted for peace and opposed the Atlantic Pact, openly declaring that once the Third World War breaks out, he will fight side by side with the Soviet Union. All of the above facts fully demonstrate that the Chinese bandit party is willing to be the fifth column of the Red imperialists, to massacre our compatriots, destroy our national roots, undermine the spirit of national independence and autonomy, and rob our people of their freedom and rights. It does not hesitate to lock the entire territory of China behind the Iron Curtain, turning it into the battlefield of the Third World War, and does not hesitate to turn all the peace-loving and good people of China into cannon fodder for the Communist International. His vicious heart and insidious methods can be said to be unprecedented and unparalleled.</p>
<p>Ironclad facts prove the hideous true face of the Chinese Communist bandit party violent group:</p>
<p>(1) Taking affiliation with the Iron Curtain as liberation, arbitrarily selling out the nation's territorial sovereignty, fully demonstrating its anti-nationalist behavior;</p>
<p>(2) Taking coercion and enslavement as emancipation, arbitrarily destroying the people's freedom and rights, fully demonstrating its anti-civil rights behavior;</p>
<p>(3) Taking looting and encroachment as liquidation, arbitrarily destroying the people's lives and property, fully demonstrating its anti-people's livelihood behavior.</p>
<p>However, Mao Zedong, the chieftain of this violent group, based on his psychology of "becoming a king if successful, a bandit if defeated" and the old trick of "hooligan ruffians as vanguards of the revolution," as well as the method of coercing peasants to launch armed riots, worked as an accomplice for the Red imperialists. In backward China, he openly raised his head and wantonly set up his so-called "new democratic anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capital behavior" as a talisman for his false and deceptive propaganda, hoping to use this to cover up his crimes of harming the country, selling out the nation, and oppressing the people. If this arch-villain is not eliminated, the instruction that "the nation will perish and the race will be destroyed in short order" will come true. Treading on the blood of the martyrs, following in the footsteps of patriots and people of goodwill across the country, we will fight together with our compatriots and fellow soldiers to realize the lofty ideals of the Three Principles of the People: government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Over the past 20 years, our alumni and comrades have fallen one after another, achieving righteousness and rushing to death, writing a glorious and moving history with their blood. The accumulated achievements have created new opportunities for national unity, independence, democracy, and progress. However, because of the Communist International Red imperialists, who are more ferocious than the Japanese aggressors, using the situation of poverty and turmoil after the world war to implement a conspiracy of expansion and aggression, and inciting and funding the Chinese Communist bandit party to undermine the country's opportunities for independence, unity, democracy, and progress, in order to achieve their ambition of communizing China and communizing Asia, internally, there is a group of dregs who lack faith in revolutionary doctrines, are corrupt and backward, opportunistic, and afraid of death, who do not know how to cherish this hard-won opportunity for national independence, unity, democracy, and progress, or who corrode the revolutionary ranks, or who echo the bandit party. As such, the Communist bandit party violent group was able to take advantage of opportunities to act arrogantly and violently, causing the revolutionary cause to suffer unprecedented setbacks.</p>
<p>After a close examination of the domestic and international situation, it can be clearly seen that the result of the evil deeds of the Chinese Communist bandit party violent group, driven by the Communist International Red imperialists, can only give the Chinese people war, not peace; can only give the Chinese people totalitarian enslavement, not the rights of freedom; can only give the Chinese people destruction, not construction. That is to say, the Chinese Communist Party can only bring chaos to the Chinese people, not peace; can only bring autocracy to the Chinese people, not democracy; can only bring poverty to the Chinese people, not food and clothing. All the reckless actions of the Communist bandit party violent group, which extinguish humanity, naturally run completely counter to all the just and reasonable needs of life. The result of this will inevitably lead the nation and the people into an irrecoverable abyss!</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of the current stage of the revolution, it is very clear that China today only has two paths to take: one path is to allow the Communist bandit party violent group to sell out the nation's territorial sovereignty, destroy the people's freedom and rights, and infringe upon the people's lives and property, causing the nation and the people to be trapped in a state of being vassals, enslaved, and plundered for a long time; the other path is for the revolutionary soldiers of the Three Principles of the People and the people throughout the country to resolutely engage in the struggle against aggression, against totalitarianism, and against plunder in order to defend the nation's territorial sovereignty, safeguard the people's freedom and rights, and protect the people's lives and property, so that the nation's independent survival and the people's free life can be ensured. At the same time, naturally, there are only two paths to take: one path is to face the situation of failure, be pessimistic and disappointed, lose heart, be cowardly and timid, live in ease and苟安, willingly abandon lofty revolutionary ideals and glorious revolutionary history, abandon the arduous and outstanding revolutionary leaders, disregard the military's duty to serve the country and the people, and even shamelessly surrender to the enemy, handing over their fate to the enemy to control, allowing the Communist bandit party to trap the nation and the people in a state of being vassals, enslaved, and plundered for a long time; the other path is to face the lessons of failure, conduct strict reviews, make practical corrections, be tenacious and unyielding, move forward bravely, become more courageous after each setback, and reaffirm that the revolutionary war against aggression, against totalitarianism, and against plunder will inevitably achieve final victory. Under any difficult circumstances, we must maintain the character of revolutionary soldiers, and with an iron will and a fearless spirit, fight to the end with the Communist bandit party violent group in order to win the nation's independent survival and the people's free life. It is very clear that the latter path leads to glory and victory.</p>
<p>Comrades, at this most critical moment, we can no longer hesitate or waver. Bravely and resolutely stand under the revolutionary banner of the Three Principles of the People, and forever unite closely with the millions of comrades who share life and death and share weal and woe, and fight for anti-aggression, anti-totalitarianism, and anti-plunder. The final victory will surely belong to us.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, to embark on the path of glory and victory, we must examine the shortcomings of the past, raise revolutionary vigilance, and reorganize the revolutionary ranks. We believe that everyone, even every revolutionary soldier, has some shortcomings. We must first use strict organization, self-criticism at any time, self-examination, and thorough reflection, muster the greatest courage to admit mistakes, and muster the greatest determination to correct mistakes. We must be able to defeat ourselves before we can defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>Today, we need to examine the thoughts, lives, behaviors, and styles of revolutionary soldiers themselves, not allowing corruption or falling behind. In particular, we need to examine the spirit, atmosphere, and discipline of the revolutionary ranks, not allowing them to be scattered, demoralized, or even corrupted. Let the elements that have become corrupt, fallen behind, and cannot be saved be eliminated from the revolutionary ranks. Let the opportunistic elements who fear death be buried alive by the Communist bandit party in front of defeatism. As long as we share weal and woe and share safety and danger with the soldiers, plan together in action, rescue each other in times of danger, do not compete for credit in victory, and do not shirk responsibility in defeat, as long as we can love the people, protect the people, not startle them when stationed, and not disturb them when marching, the morale of the entire army can surely be raised, and the hearts of the people throughout the country can surely be uplifted. The shame of past failures can surely be washed away. At the same time, retired alumni in their hometowns should also recognize the current serious situation, conduct practical reviews, not be pessimistic or disappointed, not blame heaven and earth, and not see no way out. As long as we have a breath left, our will will not slacken. We will shoulder the responsibilities that revolutionary soldiers of the Three Principles of the People should bear and wage a resolute and desperate struggle against the Communist bandit party that is undermining our military reorganization and recovery plan. As long as we are willing to do our best to organize and train the people, engage in self-defense, mobilize manpower and material resources, and support the front lines, the glorious revolutionary history that we have won in past charges will never be destroyed by the jumping clown Communist bandit party.</p>
<p>Revolutionary comrades! Everyone must raise revolutionary vigilance, thoroughly recognize the unreasonable demands of the Communist bandit party, which have recklessly put forward eight articles and twenty-four clauses in the form of a surrender document, and have brazenly rejected the people's and the government's desire for peace. The bandit leader Mao Zedong has also ordered a general offensive, frantically crossing the Yangtze River, and even vainly claimed to "thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the National Revolutionary Army." We must thoroughly understand the hidden enemies who are lurking in our ranks, shaking our will, corroding our strength, and all the pessimistic, disappointed, compromising, and surrendering enemies, both overt and covert. We must thoroughly understand our own shortcomings, the corrupt and degenerate lifestyles, the perfunctory working methods, and the unsupportive fighting methods. We must thoroughly change and correct all of these. Recognize the source of the disease, aim at these obstacles to the revolution, and concentrate unparalleled strength to carry out a major sweep.</p>
<p>Secondly, we believe that the past military failures were caused by the inherent shortcomings of the military itself, but the failure factors caused by the unhealthy and unimproved influence of the party and government were even more numerous than the shortcomings of the military itself, and cannot be fully described in a short space. We all have a common grand aspiration today: to pledge our sincerity and enthusiasm to assist in the transformation of the party, to implement all the past political orders that could not be implemented, to ensure that policies that meet the greatest interests of the greatest number of people are effectively promoted and implemented, to ensure that the masses we lead can truly live organized lives, to strive for close cooperation between the party and the government, and to strive to make political facilities a true manifestation of the party's policies. We must target this need, follow this goal, move forward bravely, and promote its realization and success.</p>
<p>Based on the above understanding, we feel that all our revolutionary comrades, whether in active service or reserve service, in the hometown where the military is rising, there is a need to reorganize and unite anew. To restore the organization of the Whampoa Revolution and carry forward the spirit of the Whampoa Revolution to strengthen the strength of the revolutionary struggle is our only responsibility today. It is also our solemn and decisive answer to the Communist Party's threat to "thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the National Army." Revolutionary comrades! We, the alumni from various places who have come to Shanghai, with infinite grief, look remotely at the tomb of the Father of the Nation, and silently mourn our compatriots who have been subjected to the ravages of war. Today, when the bandit leader Mao Zedong has undermined peace, ordered a general offensive, frantically crossed the Yangtze River, and pressed on Shanghai, the organization of the Emergency Committee of the Central Military Academy Alumni Association has been formally established in Shanghai to unite all revolutionary alumni and continue to fight to the end to eliminate the counter-revolutionary Communist bandit party violent group. We will never abandon the spirit of Premier's peace and struggle to save China, and we vow to be sincere and sincere to do our best to meet the new challenges of the Communist bandit party violent group, and to crush the conspiracy of the Communist International Red imperialists to communize China and communize Asia.</p>
<p>Revolutionary comrades! Organize, unite, thoroughly eliminate the opportunistic and pessimistic defeatists, and at the same time thoroughly eliminate the ultimate enemy of the revolution, the Communist bandit party violent group. Loyalty and treachery are exceptionally clear. Aggression and totalitarianism will inevitably fail, and truth and justice will inevitably triumph. This is very clear. Finally, we unanimously shout: Carry forward the spirit of Whampoa! Eliminate the traitorous bandits! Complete the later revolution! Build the Republic of China!

<h3>The Air Force Can Hinder the Communist Advance</h3>
<p>Chennault Attempts to Revive the Flying Tigers</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 2nd dispatch] General Chennault of the Flying Tigers has now returned to the United States. He will soon present his opinions on aid to China to Congress and attempt to revive the Flying Tigers to assist the Chinese government in its operations. Before returning to the United States, he told business people in Guangzhou that he believes that the Chinese government still has hope if it receives appropriate assistance. An air force that is specially trained to carry out bombing and ground strafing can stop the communist advance and allow the government forces to reorganize at their leisure and organize new defenses in South China. Chen suggested that if the government retains its bases in the Northwest and Southwest, such as Lanzhou and Chongqing, his Flying Tigers, once revived, can effectively deal with the communist forces.</p>
<h3>Warplanes Concentrated in Shanghai; Continuous Daily Strikes; Fruitful Results</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch] Since April 23, airplanes have been taking off and landing in Shanghai day and night. It is reported that the main military fighter planes have been concentrated in Shanghai, and they continue to fight the communist forces with strong forces.

<h3>Commissioner Yu's Office Monthly Meeting; Zhang Qun Reviews the Situation; States Determination to Strive for Stability in the Southwest; Emphasizes the Spirit of Political Innovation</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd dispatch] Zhang Qun presided over the first monthly meeting of the Commissioner's Office on the 2nd since taking office. He reported that the Communist Party's eight articles and twenty-four clauses are not only conditions for crossing the Yangtze River, but also for establishing military control institutions throughout the country. The Minjiang and Tuojiang Rivers in Sichuan Province, the Pearl River in Guangdong Province, the Lancangjiang River in Yunnan Province, the Tanshui River in Taiwan Province, and Keelung and Kaohsiung in Taiwan Province will all not be spared. Therefore, the current war for justice and the War of Resistance Against Japan are not essentially different. Both are wars against aggression. If we do not fight desperately now, the Communist Party will take our lives. However, in reviewing the situation, we should reflect on and liquidate ourselves. Everyone must acknowledge responsibility for the failures of the past. During the peace talks, there was much debate about preparing for war while seeking peace and seeking peace through war. Now that the Communist Party has revealed its true face, he will absolutely follow the national policy decision made by President Chiang, Acting President Li, and Premier He at the meeting in Hangzhou on April 22 and strive to stabilize the Southwest. He also emphasized the spirit of political innovation, stressing the three points of simplicity, speed, and certainty, hoping to strengthen the forces of unity, self-defense, and self-sufficiency. He also said that US President Roosevelt once said, "When we know what environment we are in, we know what to do." Finally, he ordered the cancellation of Sunday holidays.</p>

<h3>The Control Yuan Holds Its First Council Meeting Today After Moving to Guangzhou</h3>

<h3>Eight Captured Warships in the Yangtze River: Six Sunk by Air Force Bombing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It is reported that the naval Yangtze River Defense Fleet, which guards the capital and defends the Yangtze River, with the exception of the Yongjia and four other warships that quickly passed through the Jiangyin artillery blockade on the night of April 24th and were immediately diverted to the Nanjing and Caishi areas of the river, anchoring along the shore, ultimately could not escape the search of the Air Force. Since the end of April, the Air Force dispatched bomber squadrons to bomb them. It is reported that as of May 2nd, six of the eight warships have been destroyed, and the remaining two have also been damaged. It is expected that they can all be annihilated within days.</p>
<p>Revolutionary students and comrades! Everyone must heighten their revolutionary vigilance and thoroughly recognize the communist bandits' brazenly putting forward eight articles and twenty-four clauses, which resemble a letter of surrender with unreasonable demands, and stubbornly rejecting the people's and the government's desire for peace. We must completely recognize the sinister attempt of the bandit chieftain Mao Zedong, who has ordered a general offensive and frantically crossed the Yangtze River, and even presumptuously claimed to "thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the National Revolutionary Army." We must thoroughly understand the internal enemies, whether overt or covert, lurking in our camp who shake our will, corrode our strength, and those who are pessimistic, disappointed, and compromise and surrender. We must thoroughly change and correct our own shortcomings, such as a corrupt and degenerate lifestyle, a perfunctory work style, and a combat style that does not offer mutual support. Identify the source of the disease, aim at these obstacles to the revolution, and concentrate unparalleled strong forces to sweep them away on a large scale.</p>
<p>Secondly, we believe that the military failures of the past were due to the shortcomings of the military itself, but the failure factors caused by the unhealthy and unprogressive influence of the party and government are more numerous than the shortcomings of the military itself, and cannot be fully described in a short space. Today, we all have a common ambition to assist in the transformation of the party with sincerity and enthusiasm, eliminate corrupt elements in the party, maintain the authority of the party's leadership, tighten the party's organization, and rectify the party's discipline. We also pledge to support the government with sincerity and enthusiasm, implement political reforms, and implement all the political orders that could not be implemented in the past, so that policies that conform to the greatest interests of the vast majority of the people can be effectively promoted and implemented, ensuring that the masses we lead can truly live an organized life. Strive for close cooperation between the party and the government, and strive to make political facilities a true expression of the party's policies. We must aim at this need, follow this goal, and move forward courageously, hoping for realization and success.</p>
<p>Based on the above understanding, we feel that all of our revolutionary students and comrades, whether active or reserve, in the military or in the countryside, really have the necessity to reorganize and reunite. Restoring the organization of the Whampoa Revolution and promoting the spirit of the Whampoa Revolution to strengthen the revolutionary combat power is our only responsibility today, and it is also a clear and decisive answer to the brazen statement of the Communist Party that they want to "thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the National Army." Revolutionary students and comrades! Today, our classmates from all over the country have come to Shanghai. With infinite sorrow, we look to the mausoleum of the Founding Father of the Nation and silently remember our compatriots who have suffered from the ravages of war. Today, when the bandit leader Mao Zedong has destroyed peace, ordered a general offensive, frantically crossed the Yangtze River, and is pressing Shanghai, we have officially established the Extraordinary Committee of the Alumni Association of the Central Military Academies in Shanghai. We are determined to use the organization of the Extraordinary Committee of the Alumni Association to unite all revolutionary students and mobilize all revolutionary students to continue to fight to the end to eliminate the counter-revolutionary communist bandit violent group. We uphold the spirit of Premier Sun's peaceful struggle to save China, and pledge our utmost sincerity to meet the new challenges of the communist bandit violent group and to shatter the conspiracy of the Communist International and Red Imperialism to communize China and communize Asia.</p>
<p>Revolutionary students and comrades! Organize, unite, and completely eliminate the opportunistic, pessimistic defeatists. At the same time, completely eliminate the ultimate enemy of the revolution, the Communist bandit violent group. Loyalty and treachery, obedience and rebellion are exceptionally clear. Aggression and totalitarianism will inevitably fail, and truth and justice will inevitably triumph. This is very clear. Finally, we unanimously shout: Promote the spirit of Whampoa! Eliminate the traitorous bandits! Complete the later revolution! Build the Republic of China! Long live the Three Principles of the People! Long live the Chinese nation!</p>

<h3>Li Lisan Calls on Workers to Oppose American Imperialism: Anti-British and American Parade on May Day in Beiping</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 2nd] The Beiping Communist Radio Station broadcast on the 1st the Labor Day speech of Li Lisan, "Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Labor," calling on Chinese workers to oppose the "aggressive forces led by American imperialism." The radio station only reported Li's speech and did not broadcast the full text of the speech. The radio station had broadcast the full text of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China praising the capture of Nanjing and Taiyuan, but the statement only mentioned imperialism once and did not mention the United States at all. This possible moderation of anti-American propaganda came one day after a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party issued a statement yesterday stating that the Chinese Communist Party would consider establishing diplomatic relations with various countries under certain conditions.</p>
<p>In his speech, Li advised workers on the following four points: First, assist the Communist army in completing the revolution; second, quickly restore and develop production; third, establish and consolidate trade unions throughout the country; fourth, for the sake of China's independence, freedom, and peace, workers must stand side by side with the world's peaceful democratic forces and oppose the aggressive forces led by American imperialism.</p>

According to a spokesman for the Association, after the Portuguese nationals in Shanghai held a meeting on Sunday to discuss evacuation matters, more than 300 people had registered with the Association expressing their willingness to evacuate. However, due to the fact that various exit procedures require a considerable amount of time, the first evacuation ship, the Dutch ship "Chidatan," will not be able to evacuate all the registered Portuguese nationals when it sets sail from Shanghai on May 6th. A spokesman for the Portuguese Association also said that after the "Chidatan," the Portuguese merchant ship "Huazhong" (transliteration) may be chartered to evacuate Portuguese nationals from Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Editorial: India's New Status</h3>
<p>The British government will issue a public announcement on the 27th of last month, after the conclusion of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference held in London, stating: "The Indian government has notified the Commonwealth governments that the people of the whole country hope that India will become an independent and autonomous republic under the new constitution that is about to be implemented, but they are still willing to continue to be a member of the Commonwealth; and are willing to accept the British King as the head of the Commonwealth." From then on, the legal status of India can be completely determined. India no longer has a governor appointed by the British government, and no longer has the Privy Council of the United Kingdom as its highest judicial organ, but will be an independent and autonomous republic, only nominally recognizing the King as its head. The establishment of India's new status must be said to be the result of the efforts of Indian Prime Minister Nehru. The National Congress Party expressed satisfaction with the successful conclusion of this conference, and especially expressed a warm welcome to India's acquisition of a new legal status. The rational adjustment of British-Indian relations is an important factor for stability in Asia. Standing in the position of a neighboring country, we should express infinite joy for our neighboring country to become an independent and autonomous republic.</p>
<p>The theme of this conference, the motive of the British government in convening this conference, was to determine whether India's legal status was still within the scope of the British Commonwealth. Therefore, on the eve of the opening of this Commonwealth conference, the Indian people were very concerned about the fate of their own country, and the British government and the public were also paying attention to the future British-Indian relations. For example, the Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" hoped that the two sides, India and the United Kingdom, would still cooperate effectively, which is necessary to prevent the Communist forces from creating a fragmented situation in Asia. The Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" also said that if India believes that it must withdraw from the Commonwealth, it would be unfavorable to both the United Kingdom and India. The British media's attention to India can also be imagined.</p>
<p>On the Indian side, Prime Minister Nehru had made two suggestions to the Indian Parliament before going to the United Kingdom: (1) Recognize that the Indian people have dual nationality, that is, they are citizens of both the Indian Republic and the British Empire; (2) Continue to maintain political ties with the Empire after India's independence. At the same time, the National Congress Party also held a secret meeting to discuss the issue of India striving for independence at the British Empire Conference. It is said that there are also two different opinions in the National Congress Party. One is to advocate that India completely break away from the shackles of the British Empire and become an independent republic; the other is to advocate that India should still participate in the British Empire even if it implements the new constitution of the Indian Republic. Nehru holds this opinion.</p>
<p>India is a large country in Asia and also an ancient country with a long history and culture. India's history is bizarre and has everything. It is really a history of the old era. The beginning of the new history started on August 15, 1947. The history of India can be roughly divided into three stages: from the Aryan immigration to India and the emergence of Brahmanism to the beginning of the Gupta dynasty in 320 AD, a period of 700 years, which is a period from primitive nomads to the establishment of feudal imperial and religious power; to the 200 years after Babur established the Mughal dynasty in 1526, which is the period when the feudal Mughal dynasty invaded India and began feudal separatism; from 1757 when Clive won the Battle of Plassey, laying the foundation for the East India Company's dominant power, until 1947, it was the period when the British Empire invaded and ruled India. In the old century of India, the Indian people suffered oppression, division, and exploitation. Although the promotion of the historical culture of old India produced many religious scholars, thinkers, and philosophers, they failed to save the Indian people. In the old India, only revolutionaries and politicians who could fight for the people and lift the shackles of the British Empire were Gandhi and Nehru, the master and apprentice. Gandhi's life was spent fighting to end the old India. He came naked and left naked, and his life was upright. Nehru's life was also spent fighting to create a new India. The India after August 15, 1947, was a semi-independent and semi-free new India under Nehru's leadership.</p>
<p>The new India has been born for a year and a half. In terms of status, it is only independent in form and has not gained true independence. Furthermore, due to the partition of India and Pakistan and the rise of Pakistan, the entire India has been split into two parts. Under the role of the British Empire's "divide and rule," India and Pakistan still cannot achieve their own independence. At most, it can only be said that the British Empire's 200 years of notification has come to an end. However, it is still subject to constraints and shackles politically, militarily, and especially economically. Speaking of the domestic situation, the new India under Nehru's leadership has indeed made some achievements in the past year and a half. Apart from economic panic and the people's poverty, which have not been overcome, his achievements such as the determination and expansion of the territory of the new India, the improvement of the new India's international status, and the success of his two convocations of Asian conferences undoubtedly symbolize that the new India has become a major country in the Asian continent.</p>
<p>However, this big country still has two kinds of depression: One is that the Indian people all hope that India can achieve true and complete independence. Economically, it should not be dominated by the pound. It is especially afraid of the rising power of the US dollar. They deeply worry that the old slavery has not yet ended, and the new slavery is locked on their heads. This is a kind of depression. Secondly, Nehru's great talent for Asia shows his ambition to lead Asia everywhere, but India itself is not completely independent and free, which hinders his magnificent ambition. Nehru's thinking is a kind of reformist thinking, and his compromise is very strong. After he ascended to power, he felt powerless everywhere. However, the Indian people generally demand independence, and many people within the National Congress Party also demand that the new constitution of the Indian Republic can actually become an independent and free country. The results of Nehru's trip are still difficult to satisfy the wishes of the general Indian people.</p>
<p>The convening of the British Empire Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference is a major event after the establishment of the Atlantic Treaty. Nehru recently said to a reporter from the Daily Mail: If a world war breaks out, India may not participate in the war. This shows India's aversion to international wars; but if India cannot achieve true independence and freedom, then India still cannot avoid war. Now that the conference has ended, and India is still within the Commonwealth, how will Nehru fulfill his promise? The British praised the successful conclusion of this conference as the victory of British Prime Minister Attlee, which actually contains a profound meaning; in other words, the victory of the British Prime Minister is the failure of Nehru; the Indian people will inevitably express disappointment with the results of this conference.</p>
<h3>East-West Negotiations on the Berlin Issue May Reach an Agreement This Week: The U.S., Britain, and France Exchange Views and May Meet with Malik Today; Rumor Has It That the Four Great Powers Will Meet in France</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] New York 2nd Broadcast: The U.S. spokesperson to the United Nations recently announced: U.S. Ambassador Jessup will meet with British representative Federgan and French representative Schauffel at the U.S. headquarters at the United Nations at 3:00 PM today to discuss the lifting of the Berlin issue and the convening of a four-power foreign ministers' conference. Jessup has been negotiating with Soviet representative Malik on the German issue for a total of seven times. After meeting with Acheson and others this morning, Jessup left Washington for New York. It is expected that Jessup will meet with Malik again soon (possibly on the 3rd), and British and French representatives may participate in the meeting for the first time.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] French Foreign Minister Schumann stated at a press conference this morning: It is not possible to determine the date of the Western power foreign ministers' conference within this week. He expressed optimism about the possibility of convening this plenary session. He also revealed that the proposal to convene this meeting in Paris was not proposed by France itself. He said: Neither France nor the United States can allow this endless negotiation between the East and West. When asked whether the Soviet Union and anti-British and French countries would participate in the negotiations, he said that he did not know about it. When asked whether the negotiations would be based on the East and West or the four powers, Schumann said that it would be very reasonable in the initial stage of the negotiations. When reporters asked whether Britain was making various preparations to delay the four-power conference, Schumann said that the United Kingdom and France have always maintained a consistent attitude in responding so far. However, there are currently slight differences of opinion between the two countries, but there are no fundamental differences. Schumann concluded that convening a meeting of several people is precisely to find a middle ground.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 2nd] The date for the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin blockade may be set within this week. When the U.S. and Soviet representatives meet again in the next few days, an agreement to lift the blockade may be reached, and the date for the four foreign ministers' conference may be set. The conference period will be around the end of the month or the beginning of next month, and the location will probably be in Paris.</p>

<h3>Korean Commission Completes Inspection of South Korea</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 1st] Several members of the United Nations Korean Commission and personnel from the Commission's Secretariat recently inspected South Korea and have now completed their itinerary for April. According to reports received here at UN headquarters, the inspecting party included the Commission Chairman, representatives from China, Australia, France, and India, personnel from the Korean Transfer and U.S. Liaison Committee, and government officials. The report stated that in the places visited by the Commission representatives (some of which were areas where disturbances occurred last October), they were welcomed by officials and civilians alike, with large crowds gathering in the streets to wave flags and pay their respects. It is noted that the Korean Commission was established by the UNGA in December 1947 to continue the work of the Temporary Commission. The Temporary Commission had supervised the general election in South Korea. The Republic of Korea was established as a result of that election. The UN-supervised election only took place in South Korea, as UN agencies were consistently denied entry into the Soviet-controlled area of North Korea. The new Commission is composed of Australia, China, El Salvador, France, India, the Philippines, and Syria. Its mission is to assist in implementing UN resolutions and promoting the unification and independence of Korea.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Between Netherlands and Indonesia to Resume Within the Week</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 2nd] It is expected that the delegations from the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia may resume negotiations early this week under the auspices of the UN Commission for Indonesia. According to reports received here at UN headquarters, the Indonesian Commission is awaiting a formal request to convene a meeting. In the past week, the leaders of the two delegations have held informal talks in an effort to restore the Indonesian Republican government in Yogyakarta. Participants in these discussions include the head of the Dutch delegation, Van Royen, and the Prime Minister of the Indonesian Republican government, Hatta. The Dutch have agreed to restore the Republican government in Yogyakarta, on the condition that guerrilla warfare ceases and that the Republic agrees to hold a round table conference in The Hague to discuss the Indonesian issue. The Indonesian side stated that it could not make any decisions regarding the Dutch proposals until the Indonesian government is restored and functioning.</p>
<h3>Allied Powers' Strict Military Control Over Japan Has Transformed Into Friendly Guidance; MacArthur Announces on the Anniversary of the New Japan's Birth</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] MacArthur stated today in a statement commemorating the second anniversary of the promulgation of the new Japanese Constitution that the objectives outlined at the Potsdam Conference, many of which have not been completed, have been diligently fulfilled by Japan. The reason why the Allied forces have not yet withdrawn is not due to Japan's fault, but due to its inability to control external circumstances. The Allied occupation has transformed from strict military control into friendly guidance by a protective power. This transitional period will continue to progress rapidly as Japan assumes the responsibility of self-governance. However, the Japanese people should strictly guard against the infiltration of concepts that distrust human wisdom, hinder individual dignity, and severely restrict individual freedom. This is the second anniversary of the birth of the New Japan. It must be understood that there is no greater human purpose than to defend the rights granted by the Constitution. Japan can thereby ensure its peaceful and orderly progress.</p>
<h3>Jewish Forces in Southern Jerusalem Complete Military Operations</h3>
<p>Bishop Ordered Villagers to Resist</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 2nd] All military operations south of Jerusalem have now been completed. Although no official statement has been issued here or in Jerusalem regarding this matter, it is reported that conflicts occurred when Israeli forces, acting in accordance with the agreement between Israel and Transjordan, advanced to occupy villages near Haifa and Jerusalem. According to well-informed sources, with the exception of only one village that was occupied peacefully, all the villagers and guerrillas silently continued to resist under the orders of the Archbishop of Jerusalem. Therefore, Israel launched an attack, completing the operation within two hours, and then withdrew. Jerusalem was under strict guard for two and a half hours due to an accident and the explosion of several shells.</p>
<h3>Lovett Asks U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Approve the Atlantic Pact; Norway and Iceland Participate and are Subjected to Pressure</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Washington, 2nd, broadcast: Former Undersecretary of State Lovett stated to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that small countries such as Norway and Iceland joined the North Atlantic Pact voluntarily, denying that major powers had exerted pressure on them. He pointed out that the pact is absolutely necessary for the security of the United States and world peace, and requested the Foreign Relations Committee to approve the pact.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Former Secretary of State Lovett will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today to express his views on the North Atlantic Treaty. This will be the fourth day of hearings, which will not be open to the public. The first session began last Wednesday, when Secretary of State Acheson testified. The hearings are expected to last for several weeks. During this time, the committee will hear the views of both supporters and opponents of the defense pact. It is generally expected that Army Chief of Staff General Bradley, former Secretary of the Army Patterson, and others will express their support for the pact this week, while those presenting opposing testimony will include Wallace. After all those invited have expressed their views, the Foreign Relations Committee will hold a closed session and draft a report. The treaty will then be submitted to the full Senate for debate and final action. The treaty must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the Senate before it becomes binding on the United States. General Bradley will be asked to express how military assistance can supplement the pact. During last week's hearings, Secretary of State Acheson and Secretary of Defense Johnson both commented on the proposed arms assistance program. Although the North Atlantic Treaty and the proposed military assistance program for the contracting states are related in the committee's discussions, these two will still require separate legislative actions. The North Atlantic Treaty only requires Senate approval. The military assistance program still needs to be formally submitted to Congress, and this program will require action by both the House and the Senate, as well as the allocation of funds. Currently, the committee is hearing opinions on the approval of the Atlantic Pact, and will also hear about the military assistance program.</p>

<h3>European Countries Hold Grand Ceremonies for May Day Labor Day; Stalin Personally Inspects Troops and Workers' Processions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 1st] Today, on May Day Labor Day, President Stalin, along with members of the Soviet Communist Party Politburo and the Central Committee, stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum in the brilliant sunlight for an hour-long military parade to celebrate the holiday. Above the square, Stalin's son, Major General Vasily Stalin, led an air force performance to demonstrate the progress of Soviet jet aircraft capabilities. U.S. Embassy Air Force Attaché Lieutenant Colonel Rendell commented, "The Soviet Air Force's skills have made considerable progress." U.S. Embassy Army Attaché Major General O'Donnell commented, "The grandeur of the military parade has never been seen before."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Union leaders and workers around the world celebrated May Day Labor Day today. In West Berlin, clashes occurred because police prevented workers from going to East Berlin to participate in the celebrations. In the Eastern Bloc countries, grand ceremonies such as parades and military reviews were held. Marshal Stalin, as usual, reviewed the parade of troops and a grand procession of one million workers in Red Square. He stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum for several hours, looking energetic and smiling. The latest Soviet aircraft, including three jet-propelled aircraft, soared through the sky in a performance. The incident in West Berlin was caused by the U.S. authorities only allowing the anti-communist General Confederation of Trade Unions to march within the U.S. sector. A group of workers attempted to pass through the U.S. sector to participate in the demonstration in the Soviet sector. They were driven away by police with batons, and several people were injured. Tens of thousands of workers gathered in Freedom Square in the Soviet sector of Berlin. In Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 45,000 people held a May Day celebration, which was hosted by the Dutch Communist Party. A large demonstration of 300,000 people was held in the Romanian capital, with the phrase "peace" being the most prominent in the banners and slogans. The Norwegian Labor Party and Communist Party jointly held an unprecedented march in Oslo, with no unfortunate incidents occurring. The banners carried by Communist Party members were mostly directed at Truman, Churchill, and the Atlantic Pact. In Belgrade, 100,000 workers, farmers, women, and children marched past Marshal Tito. The procession lasted for seven hours. Tito wore a white marshal's uniform and stood on the command platform, which was decorated with a huge red star symbol and large portraits of Stalin, Lenin, Marx, and Engels. Paris was unusually quiet today, as most workers took the day off.</p>
<h3>U.S. Decommissions Central Pacific Air Force Command</h3>
<p>All Fighters and Bombers Transferred Elsewhere</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] From next month, air defense in the Central Pacific will rely entirely on naval aviation and Marine Corps aviation. The Air Force Department recently announced that the Pacific Air Force Command will be decommissioned on June 1st. The command has gradually reduced its scope over the past two years, and now only has a small number of transport detachments and one fighter squadron of about 75 aircraft. After these remaining troops are withdrawn to the United States, the Air Force will not leave a single fighter or bomber in the Central Pacific. In the future, the nearest major base will be Guam, and other units will be based in Japan, Okinawa, and the Philippines. At the same time, the naval center is also shifting from the Pacific, and the European situation is giving the Atlantic strategy new value. The Navy used to station hundreds of warships in the Pacific, but this has now been reduced to 96 ships, and coastal stations have also been reduced accordingly. The current fleet includes five aircraft carriers (two 27,000-ton Essex-class carriers and three 14,500-ton light aircraft carriers). Air defense in the Central Pacific will rely entirely on the fighter and bomber squadrons on these five aircraft carriers. The five ships carry a total of approximately 300 aircraft, commanded by the Naval Aviation and Marine Corps Aviation Commands. In addition to the aircraft carriers, the Pacific Fleet also has six cruisers, 53 destroyers and destroyer escorts, and 32 submarines. After the Pacific Air Force Command is disbanded, the air transport unit in the area will be incorporated into the mixed air-sea organization of the "Military Air Transport Service."</p>
<h3>Disbanding German Industry Has Achieved Incomparable Success, According to Clay's Response to Investigator</h3>
<p>Clay Responds to Investigation into Allegations Regarding Country's Actual Situation</p>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, Germany, 1st] U.S. Military Governor of Germany Clay submitted a report to the War Department today in response to allegations from investigating countries that U.S. authorities in Germany had not disbanded large German industrial and commercial organizations. Clay said that disbanding large German industry has achieved unparalleled success. We have issued more than 1,100 notices of dissolution of large industrial organizations. Germany's highly centralized financial system has been destroyed and replaced by a decentralized system similar to the Federal Reserve System in the United States, and the scope of activities of its branches is also restricted.</p>
<h3>U.S. Dismantling of German Industry Proceeding Extremely Slowly</h3>
<p>Due to Conflict with Military Government Plans</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] According to the final report of the investigative committee appointed by U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal in December 1940, the U.S. plan to dismantle industrial alliances in Germany is indeed a sound policy, but the results have been very slow. This recently released report makes twelve recommendations to improve the plan to dismantle industrial alliances. The report states that the reasons for the plan's slow progress are as follows: (1) The Soviet authorities in Germany are not cooperating; (2) The United Kingdom lacks enthusiasm for the overall plan; (3) U.S. authorities are prioritizing the promotion of Germany's economic recovery and neglecting the fragmentation of its industry. In order to explain the above three recommendations, the investigative committee's report recounts the different opinions between the committee and U.S. Military Governor General Clay regarding how to deal with the two major factories that constitute the district's activities. One of the factories is the Ting Schiel Locomotive Factory, which specializes in manufacturing locomotives for the government-owned railway system. General Clay, feeling that transportation was at a standstill, took a cautious approach and historically implemented the dismantling action in order to maintain the production of the Ting Schiel Company. Similarly, General Clay believed that Germany's only steel ball manufacturing plant was essential for restoring Germany's economy. The report of the three-person committee is currently being studied by Assistant Secretary of the Army Fuchs. The members of the committee are Federal Trade Commissioner Ferguson (Chairman), New York City lawyer Essex, and Chicago employer advisor Kiana. The three-person group spent several weeks in Germany last December conducting research. After making a preliminary study of the report, Fuchs pointed out that the committee's task was to study the plan for the decentralization of German industry and the dissolution of German trade associations, while General Clay had to ensure that the plan for the dissolution of trade associations must be coordinated with the urgent need for German economic recovery, which was a very difficult task.</p>
<h3>Former Irish Prime Minister Hopes Northern Ireland Will Not Turn Its Back on Unification; Hopes Britain Will End the Divided State of Ireland</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Former Irish Prime Minister Éamon de Valera addressed a meeting of the "Irish Anti-Partition League" here today, revealing that the British Prime Minister had expressed to him his hope that the division of Northern and Southern Ireland could be ended. De Valera said that if the British government truly had this intention, why didn't it publicly announce its good intentions?

<h3>Truman Reduces U.S. Air Force Bases</h3>
<p>Air Force Chief of Staff Expresses Regret</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Indianapolis, 1st] U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg stated in an address at the American Legion convention on the night of the 1st that the reduction in the number of U.S. Air Force bases from 59 to 48 in President Truman's 1950 budget proposal, in order to save expenses, was most regrettable. Vandenberg said that due to this reduction, the United States could only avoid defeat and protect itself if a war were to break out. He also said that of these 48 bases, 14 would need to accommodate 36 Super Bombers.</p>
<h3>British Labour Leader Reveals Election Plans</h3>
<p>Attlee Emphasizes the Four Freedoms of the Communist Party</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Prime Minister Attlee and other Labour leaders have roughly revealed the Communist Party's election plans for 1950 in their May Day speeches today. Attlee, in an address at a political gathering in Norwich, emphasized that the Communist Party's creed is based on four freedoms: freedom of speech and thought, freedom to choose the government, freedom of the individual from oppression by the strong, and freedom of the individual from economic tyranny by the few. Today's concept of freedom is no longer the freedom advocated by old-fashioned individualists, where individuals arbitrarily fight for dominance. True freedom can only exist in an organized society, where blind economic forces are controlled in the public interest. Attlee also emphasized the benefits that the British people receive under the social insurance system, and said that this system has aroused great interest in the United States, and President Truman also intends to launch a similar plan.</p>
<h3>American Obstetrics Professor Invents Pregnancy Test Method</h3>
<p>Proof Can Be Obtained in Minutes</p>
<p>[United Press, Chicago, 2nd] Li Quixson, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Medical School here, has invented a simple pregnancy test method that is completely accurate and reliable and can be proven in a doctor's office in just a few minutes. This test method is based on the reaction of a simplified chemical reagent to the urine of pregnant women. According to Li's report at a joint meeting of obstetrics and gynecology societies in Chicago and St. Louis Canlans, he has used this method to test more than 1,000 women in five years, and it can accurately detect pregnancy even at an early stage. This method eliminates the need for laboratory animals and is four times faster than the simplest method currently in use. Results can be obtained half an hour after obtaining the urine sample.</p>

<h3>Records Replace Church Bells; Mass Becomes More Solemn</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bayeux, France, 3rd] The poor village of Ritole, near here, is unable to afford new church bells, so a gramophone with an amplifier has been installed in the church bell tower.

<h3>De Gaulle Takes the Opportunity to Launch a Fierce Attack on the French Government's Policy Towards Germany; Calls for the Joint Establishment of Another Regime</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st] General de Gaulle stated in a May Day public rally to the "Rally of the French People" today that "the Communist Party is building the largest empire in history." He attacked the French government for spreading a shameful atmosphere of optimism and using chloroform anesthesia on the French people, and said that the current government is "a team of mediocrities." He also fiercely criticized the French government's policy towards Germany as "tending towards the establishment of a fourth German republic, and succumbing to the British and American policy towards Germany, abandoning France's traditional policy, which is to incorporate the German states and the Ruhr region into a true European Federation." De Gaulle called on members of the People's Group to help him change this unsatisfactory French regime, and to jointly establish another regime with him to implement the opinions supported by the majority. Speaking of national defense issues, De Gaulle said that France should establish an appropriate national defense force capable of playing an effective role in the work of defending Europe. De Gaulle continued to declare that the Atlantic Pact is still quite vague regarding the actual military assistance that France can obtain when attacked. He also criticized the Allied strategy of making Britain the main bulwark of European defense, rather than France. He also attacked the current French government, saying: "The current government is drifting with the tide." De Gaulle concluded by saying: "We need to re-establish national unity, and especially need to first restore national authority, which is the sole goal of the People's Group."</p>
<h3>From Acheson's Perspective on American Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— By Hash</p>
<p>Translated from "The Christian Science Monitor"</p>
<p>Now, American foreign policy will shift its focus and direction. By what method, and to what extent? President Truman's acceptance of the resignations of his two top State Department officials, Marshall and Lovett, and the appointment of Acheson and Webb as successors, has become the culmination of a series of events. The heads of state and diplomatic agencies of every country in the world are probably contemplating this issue. However, if it were not for the following events, the personnel changes in the State Department would not have been so prominent and so urgently in need of understanding.</p>
<p>During the presidential election, Truman's remarks suggested that he was confident that he would eventually be able to achieve a reasonably satisfactory peace with the Soviet Union. Columnist Franklin, who served as a speechwriter for the presidential campaign, predicted on November 29 that the government's policy would get rid of what he called the "Byrnes-Marshall-Forrestal" plan. This column was denied by the President. However, on December 27, Truman announced his opinion that peace with the Soviet Union was possible, and he decided to use his next four years in office to seek it. He added his view that there were divisions within the Kremlin, and that some of its leaders wanted peace.</p>
<p>The climax came in early January. Franklin wrote another column in a popular publication, this time in "Life" magazine. But Truman once again denied Franklin's assessment, namely that Truman had reversed course and would make a radical shift in American foreign policy towards being friendly to the Soviets. However, the highly reliable and well-informed columnist Lippmann, who believed that Franklin's claim was not worth taking seriously and said that the American economy did not follow the same murderous or theoretical direction that Kremlin foreign policy followed, but who had evidence to confirm Truman's claim that there were divisions within the Kremlin, made the following observation:</p>
<p>"In my view, the President's intuition that the entire conflict (between the West and the Soviet Union) should be re-evaluated, reviewed, and reconsidered, and that the diplomatic deadlock should be broken by active measures, perfectly explains the situation in Europe and the prospects for Western society."</p>
<p>Then came the resignation of Secretary of State Marshall and the appointment of Acheson as his successor. What is the significance of these events? In my opinion, Franklin not only oversimplified the significance, but also exaggerated it. First, Acheson had served as Undersecretary of State under Marshall and had cooperated with him most harmoniously. Second, Acheson was the initiator of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. Therefore, the personnel change from Marshall to Acheson does not necessarily imply a radical political change. Acheson's track record can serve as a prelude, masking any strong assumption that he might be "soft on the Soviets" or have a tendency towards "appeasement." A person who sent American military equipment and advisors to Greece to help fight communism, and who launched the Marshall Plan, which became anathema to Moscow, cannot be expected to overturn the entire policy contained in these actions.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the emphasis and significance lie in more complex nuances. Naturally, changes are still uncertain, but I would say that the change does not come from a sense of altered sentiment or any reversal of hope, but, as Lippmann sees it, from the fact that the underlying situation affecting foreign policy is changing, and therefore policy should be adjusted to adapt to this change. Franklin believes that the "Byrnes-Marshall-Forrestal policy" was a bad thing and should therefore be abandoned now. My understanding is that Truman and Acheson have reached an agreement and are jointly participating in the formulation of a policy dictated by the times. This policy represents a necessary strategy to protect Western society during this post-war recovery period, and also represents the opportunity for American diplomacy to rebuild its ability to cope with the post-war forces of communism and Soviet expansion. Therefore, if there is a change in policy, the change is not the result of an understanding that the past was wrong, but the result of an assessment. This assessment recognizes that policy has mostly achieved its goal of rebuilding the West's ability to cope, and that the time is approaching when the new ability to cope can be used to push the Soviet Union towards a new and rational attitude of reducing the power struggle.</p>
<p>I also believe that Marshall's physical strength could have continued his position as Secretary of State, this same change could have also occurred. In other words, this situation is not a change of policy, but a development of the policy and logic of the Byrnes-Marshall era. That policy was by no means merely aimed at being "tough on the Soviets," but simply at strengthening Western power to the point where it could reach a solution with the Soviet Union that was favorable to Western security.</p>
<p>But among all these factors contributing to change, there are some incidental factors. Secretary of State Marshall was the most respected and influential military figure in America during the war, and Lovett was transferred from the War Department to become Undersecretary of State. Acheson is a non-military lawyer. Webb, who succeeded Lovett, had previously been the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, and before that, a non-military lawyer who assisted members of Congress. Second, Webb played a significant role when he was Director of the Budget, when Truman insisted on a military budget of 15 billion, opposing the 23 billion advocated by the military.</p>
<p>Therefore, the influence of the boundary between the State Department and the Department of Defense on diplomacy will be reduced in the future. The appointment of Acheson and Webb is due to their careful compliance with the authority of the White House during their terms of office. In the State Department under Byrnes, Byrnes' relationship with Truman eventually became strained. At that time, Acheson was Undersecretary of State, and he was very respectful to Byrnes, but he also tried to avoid any accusations of going over Truman's head.</p>
<p>Therefore, another meaning of this matter is that the White House will have more direct control over foreign policy. During Marshall's tenure as Secretary of State, Truman had completely entrusted foreign policy matters to Marshall, and now he is placing people in senior positions who are compliant with his opinions and can be expected to carry out his own proposals.</p>
<p>Truman has four more years in office and does not need to rush. He has time to implement his policies at his leisure. He believes that now is the time to try to reduce the power struggle, and naturally he will take advantage of this opportunity. As for what method to adopt, that is the question. Of course, Truman will not be more in favor of "appeasement" than Acheson.</p>

<h3>Property Construction Donation Business Tax: Finance Bureau Adjusts Implementation; City Government Salary to be Issued Tomorrow or the Day After</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The adjustment of the donation rate for the city's property donation and municipal construction donation was submitted by the municipal government to the Municipal Council for review. Except for the cancellation of the "graded progressive" method, the rest were approved as proposed and have been levied since May 1. Our reporter visited Director Qian of the Finance Bureau, who said that the adjustment of the property construction donation was due to the excessive depreciation of the currency, and the original donation amount was small, which was not enough to cover the collection costs. Moreover, taxpayers did not have the same amount of banknotes to pay, which was ridiculed by public opinion and citizens' letters. The Finance Bureau's duty was to handle it early, but because the tax adjustment had to be approved by the Municipal Council, the economic situation completely changed during the months of recess, and it could no longer be delayed. Therefore, the municipal government urged an early meeting so that it could be implemented as soon as possible. As for the original "graded progressive" method, it was originally intended to reduce the burden on ordinary citizens and enable those with property and higher living standards to pay more taxes. Since it has been revoked by the public opinion organs, it should be followed. The remaining key points of the adjustment are approximately: (1) Starting from the summer season, it will be changed to monthly collection. (2) The donation amount in the autumn of the 37th year will be used as the tax base for property construction donations in the future. (3) The job index (i.e., salary index) of the last period of the month before the levy will be multiplied to be the donation amount payable. (4) The spring property construction donation for this year will be multiplied by the index at the end of April and collected together with April.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the adjustment of the city's business tax was also discussed at a meeting of the Review Committee on Saturday afternoon of last week, and it was decided that (1) starting from the summer of this year, the business tax will also be changed to monthly collection. (2) The donation amount in the autumn of the 37th year will be used as the tax base for business tax in the future. (3) The base will be multiplied by the price index on the last day of the month before the levy to be the amount of tax payable. (4) It must be paid within five days from the date of delivery. If it is overdue for one day, the original tax amount will be adjusted and collected according to the latest living index, and a penalty of 5% will be added. This is calculated in the same way as "compound interest." The punishment method for property construction donations is also handled in the same way.</p>
<p>The adjustment method for land value tax has also been amended and passed by the Municipal Council, and the implementation date will be determined separately by the Land Administration Bureau. The "Gasoline Sales Donation Collection Method" originally proposed by the municipal government has been retained.</p>
<p>Recently, prices have been high and public educators have a hard life. Regarding the public education index, the central government announced yesterday that it is 100,000 times. When will the public education salary be issued in this city, which is the most concerned issue of the municipal government?

<h3>Yang Chuo'an Unable to Bear Leaving for the South, Resigns as Deputy Minister of Finance to Stay in Shanghai to Raise Food; Amount Transported to Shanghai Can Supply Three Months</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The food problem of Shanghai's six million citizens has been safely overcome over the years through the supply of household rice by the Emergency Food Procurement and Storage Association and the US Economic Cooperation Administration, which has not been interrupted. At this time of year when the old harvest is running out and the new harvest is not yet ready, and due to the situation, the source is on the verge of being cut off, the extreme seriousness of the city's food problem is beyond words. If a large amount of food is not purchased and stored at this time, I am afraid that there will be a shortage of food soon. Mr. Yang Chuo'an, the director of the Food Storage Association, in view of this, has been running around to find ways to not only request the allocation of foreign exchange from the Central Bank to purchase more than 20,000 tons of foreign rice (approximately 300,000 piculs), but also to agree with the US Economic Cooperation Administration to continue transporting the previously scheduled American rice to Shanghai without transferring it elsewhere. It is estimated that the food storage association, the US Economic Cooperation Administration, and the Shanghai Free Market have about 160,000 tons of grain in stock (approximately 2.2 million piculs), including the amount that can be purchased and transported to Shanghai successively before the end of June, which can supply Shanghai's citizens with food for three months. It is also heard that Mr. Yang has resigned from his position as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance in order to focus on planning the food supply for the citizens of Shanghai. The telegram stated that "the Shanghai food situation is serious and I cannot bear to leave for the south."</p>

<h3>All Factories of China Textile Continue to Work as Usual: Production Efficiency Has Declined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to a person in charge of China Textile Construction Company, the factories affiliated to the company still operate five days and six nights a week despite the current difficult environment. However, due to the issue of treatment and salary payment, the work mood of the employees has been reduced, so the production efficiency has been significantly reduced. Some factories have also refused to let yarn and cloth leave the factory.</p>
<p>The company also opened yarn as usual yesterday, opening a kind of 40-count Sunlight, with an opening price of 920 million yuan. Only one household quoted for purchase, but the quotation was lower than the opening price, and the result was no transaction.</p>
<h3>Long Queue in Front of the Social Bureau: Concurrent Operation of Silver Dollar Stores: Registration is Very Enthusiastic: The First Batch of Permits to be Completed Before the 8th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the Garrison Department strictly stipulated that a permit must be obtained before selling silver dollars, the stores in the city that concurrently operate silver dollar sales have been very enthusiastic about registering with the Social Bureau. Yesterday, a long queue formed in front of the Social Bureau. Each application form costs 50,000 yuan. The first batch of 3,000 application forms was issued yesterday afternoon. After the merchants filled out the forms and sent them to the bureau, the permits were issued immediately. 600 permits can be issued every day. The bureau will be open as usual on Sundays. It is expected that it will be completed before the 8th of this month. Stricter inspections will be conducted by the military police starting from the 9th, and those who operate without a license will be banned. The second batch of 5,000 application forms will then be registered and distributed. The method has been slightly changed, and each form has been changed to a registration fee of 250,000 yuan. The requirement to affix two photos has been cancelled, and only the business registration certificate of each store is required to apply. Stores with a shop but without a business registration certificate must have a certificate issued by a store that has already registered, proving that the shop has a capital of more than 50 silver dollars. If scalpers are found to be impersonating stores to apply, they will be severely punished after being found out. Stall vendors or individuals who sell silver dollars on the roadside must apply to the police station, and the Social Bureau will not handle it.</p>
<h3>Source of Silver Dollars Seems Strong: Street Hype Lower</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday's silver dollar market situation, because the authorities announced a strict order to buy and sell silver dollars, must register and obtain a license, otherwise, if found out, in addition to the confiscation of silver dollars, the identity card will be cancelled and deported. General firms are wary. Street silver scalpers also did not dare to shout loudly and openly, and buying interest turned light. Because the Central Bank announced that 4 million is equivalent to one, the factories mostly issued silver dollars, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Yuan Datou, in the morning, amid a sell-off, fell to a minimum of 3 million, 3.5 million. Near noon, it rose slightly to 3.3 million, 3.6 million, 3.7 million, mostly only selling and not buying, and the foothold was quite weak. In promissory note transactions, Datou fell to a minimum of 4 million, 4.5 million, and finally shouted 5 million, 6 million.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Rise to Limit Up, Off-Exchange Bids for Weaker</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the Chinese stock market, all stocks opened at the limit up yesterday, with no selling until noon, and no transactions for the entire day.

Off-exchange offers for Yongsha initially asked for 27 to 29 yuan, but then decreased to 25 to 27 yuan. Xinguang, Meiya, and others saw demand at 15% above the listed price, but many holders were still unwilling to sell. The market remained at the limit without breaking through, and no transactions occurred. However, due to the tightening of credit and slightly weary investor sentiment, bids for various stocks were slightly lower than in the previous session.</p>
<p>Gold Bonds Rise to Limit</p>
<p>Gold public bonds opened at 13.133 million yuan for buying, immediately reaching the limit. There was no selling until the noon close. Throughout the day, only bids were made, with no transactions. The afternoon closed at the limit.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Plunges Yesterday After Days of Excessive Gains</h3>
<p>Plunge of seventy to eighty percent compared with last week's highest price</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the gold market softened, plunging by about 70% to 80% compared with last week's peak. Due to days of excessive gains and a significant disconnect from the silver dollar, there was risk aversion, and various parties rushed to exit, with many exchanging gold for banknotes. Off-exchange spot prices opened at 350 million to 400 million, then plummeted to 230 million to 280 million, before slightly rising to 310 million to 340 million at noon. Afternoon trading was sparse, and transactions were thin, having reached as high as 350 million to 380 million, before closing at 320 million to 370 million.</p>
<p>The decline in the off-exchange U.S. dollar was relatively slow, as rumors circulated that the U.S. dollar in the north was trading at three to one, which calmed investor sentiment. Small investors actively exchanged currency. The morning opening was 7.5 million to 8 million, briefly falling to 5 million to 5.5 million, before closing at 6.3 million to 6.8 million at noon. In the afternoon, it rose to 7 million to 7.5 million, eventually closing at 6.8 million to 7.3 million, down 700,000 from the previous day.

<h3>Rice Prices Show Slight Increase</h3>
<p>Flour Sales Particularly Strong, Trend Firm</p>
<p>The rice market showed a slight increase. Arrivals were scarce, and investor sentiment remained stable, so there were fewer sellers. In the North City market, top-grade white rice was equivalent to 5.6 silver yuan, a slight increase of 0.1 yuan. Converted at a rate of 4 million, it was 22.4 million yuan, an increase of 10 million yuan compared with last Saturday. Thin rice was 5.5 yuan. In the South City market, top-grade white rice was 5 yuan, and thin rice was 5.2 yuan, similar to last Saturday. Early rice increased by 0.1 yuan. Converted at a rate of 4 million in gold yuan notes, top-grade white rice was 20 million, thin rice was 20.8 million, and early rice was 19.2 million.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices were initially stable, then increased. Because actual sales in the main streets were still active, many were replenishing their stocks from the market, making the market brisk. The current cash price for soybean oil was 54 million to 57 million yuan, rapeseed oil was 42 million to 46.5 million yuan, and raw oil was 45 million to 51 million yuan. Converted to silver dollars, soybean oil was 18 yuan, rapeseed oil was 15.5 yuan, and raw oil was 16 yuan, each up by 1.5 to 2 yuan. Soybean cake remained unopened.</p>
<p>Amidst the decline of various commodities, flour alone showed firmness. As the currency shortage was resolved and silver dollar transactions were active, the market was flourishing. Old-brand flour initially opened at 4.2 million, but sales in the main streets were particularly strong, once surging to 5 million. Later, holders took profits at high prices, falling back to 4.5 million. Bingchuan flour opened at 3.6 million, and traded as high as 4.2 million in the central market, before closing at 3.9 million, an increase of 20% compared with last Saturday. Large bags of Fuxin bran were 3.6 million, equivalent to 1.2 silver yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Market Still Stagnant, Off-Exchange Bids Plummet</h3>

Ultimately, high-quality fabrics such as "Four Gentlemen" gabardine and "Dragon Head" fine cloth were generally traded at 20 million gold yuan notes per bolt. The market consistently saw no transactions. Private mills continued to adjust prices. High-end Shilin increased to 55 million, and Daming silk pongee was 3,000 yuan, both increasing by around 10%.</p>

<h3>Tense Table Tennis Match: Choubai Team Wins Against Postal Service After Hard Battle</h3>
<p>Three More B-Group Matches Today</p>
<p>In the fourth Table Tennis League, Choubai played against the Postal Service in the A-group the night before last. The venue was temporarily changed to the Postal Service's table tennis room. The Postal Service was well-prepared and had a strong presence. Choubai players rushed to the venue from the Jingzong table tennis room one after another, in good spirits. In the first match, Postal Service's young player Wang Chuanyao, unafraid of the young, defeated Choubai captain Yang Changxi in two straight games. In the second match, Yang Changjia was also defeated by Postal Service's Jiang Chunshan. Choubai lost two matches in a row, creating an emergency situation. In the third match, Postal Service's main player Liu Zaoshi faced Choubai's Kong Hanchen. Zaoshi was a well-rounded player and had been selected as a representative of the Shanghai team. Although Kong was an older player who was considered past his prime, it was expected that Zaoshi would win without a doubt. However, Kong, undeterred, fought tenaciously, drawing the ball exceptionally steadily and hitting with ease, as if divinely aided. Zaoshi, facing the Asian Games, was unable to withstand the pressure and lost in two straight games. Subsequently, Choubai's Weng Shuheng seized the opportunity to attack fiercely, playing exceptionally well. Postal Service's Zhuang Kunrong, a hefty player, advanced relentlessly. The two engaged in a fierce three-game battle, with very close scores. Zhuang failed to remain calm and ultimately lost. Relying on the unexpected success of Kong and Weng, Choubai tied the score at two each. In the final match, Choubai turned the tables. Gu Shenghui launched a desperate counterattack, leading all the way. Postal Service's veteran Wang Huizhang repeatedly missed opportunities to win. After a long battle, his endurance failed, and Gu won 2-0. As a result, Choubai miraculously revived, winning 3-2 in a narrow escape. Today (May 3), three more B-group matches will be held. The records of the two teams and today's schedule are listed below:</p>

<h3>Inspecting Mongolia</h3>
<p>[Northwest News] The southern part of Chahar-Mongolia is jointly managed by the Chahar tribes, with one banner each (the Right Blue, Right White, Bordered Yellow, Bordered White, Ming'an, Shangdu, and the Right and Left Banners of Tai Temple) and the Doron Lama Printing Office. The population is only 31,319. To the north lies the Xilingol League. Originally, the Xilingol Mongols only had ten banners (East and West Sunid, East and West Abaga, East and West Abagahunar, East and West Harchin, East and West Ujimqin). In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the Buryat people, who had been serving in Outer Mongolia, were incited by the Soviet Union to "revolt." As a result, these Buddhist Buryats fled from Outer Mongolia to Kulunber in Xilingol League. It was not until the eighteenth year of the Republic of China that they moved to the border area between West Harchin and East Abaga. By the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Panchen Lama arrived in Chahar and petitioned the central government on behalf of the Buryats to establish a banner. Therefore, the current Xilingol League has a total of eleven banners, with a total population of 54,286.</p>
<p>The terrain of Chahar-Mongolia is flat, with clear streams and green fields forming a vast natural grassland. On this vast grassland, countless lives are nurtured. Large herds of cattle, sheep, horses, and camels gallop and chase each other across the grassland. A shepherd boy lies on the grassland, playing with the whip in his hand. A horseman rides on horseback, galloping around the herds, watching over them. When tired, they also lie on the grassland to rest, humming love songs like "Waiting for My Love" that the girls practice singing. A beautiful picture of nature that can only be appreciated on the grasslands of the frontier, and only on the grasslands of the frontier can this natural scene be depicted.</p>
<p>The Mongols do not live in cities, and larger tribes are rarely seen. Usually, there are only four or five or a dozen households. Each village is separated by several or dozens of miles. In the Xilingol League, a small number of princes, lamas, and property owners live in brick and wood buildings. Other people live in mobile yurts, migrating with the availability of water and grass, and needing to move every few days or ten days. Their diet consists mainly of milk tea, beef, mutton, and miscellaneous grains of rice and flour, especially milk tea, which is an indispensable beverage every day. Milk tea is made by boiling brick tea and adding milk or ghee. It has a sweet and salty taste and is as refreshing as a spring. Butter and cheese curds are made from cow and sheep milk, mixed with fried rice, and drunk with milk tea two or three times a day. Wine is also made from cow and horse milk, which is used to entertain guests and as a daily beverage. Cow dung, sheep dung, or camel dung is used for cooking or heating in winter, occasionally with willow branches and dry wood, but the main fuel is still cow dung.</p>
<p>In terms of clothing, cotton cloth is used for clothing in summer, and silk for the nobility. The sleeves are long and the body is wide. In winter, sheepskin and various animal skins are used for clothing. In terms of color, lamas mostly use red and yellow, while other people of all levels wear gray, blue, and green. They all wear colorful silk belts around their waists, with pipes, snuff bottles, knives, flints, necklaces, and Buddha statues inserted on both sides of the belt. They wear leather or cloth boots. Women like to wear gold and silver headbands, inlaid with coral and pearls, adorned with tassels hanging on both sides for decoration. These headbands are very expensive, and the construction style is different in each banner. Unmarried girls only wear earrings and no other ornaments.</p>
<p>The marriage age of Mongol compatriots is around eighteen for both men and women. The wedding ceremony is usually held with the bride being two or three years younger than the groom. The establishment of marriage does not require the consent of the man and woman. It is generally based on the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers. The man asks a matchmaker to negotiate the betrothal gifts with the woman's family. After both parties agree, the man gives the woman's family a small amount of clothing, and the woman's family provides a large dowry of headwear and clothing. On the eve of the wedding, both parties invite male and female relatives and friends to gather for a banquet, and invite a man from the man's family to be the leader, responsible for guiding the wedding. The next day, the groom carries a bow and arrow, dressed as a knight, accompanied by two groomsmen (one older brother and one younger brother) and many guests, all riding fine horses to the woman's house. At that time, relatives and friends of the woman's family line up in front of the door to welcome the guests, exchange greetings, and enter the room, then exchange snuff bottles (a type of etiquette), greetings, and toasting rituals. After various rituals are carried out, they are seated. After three rounds of wine, the groom, groomsmen, and guests go to the room to worship the Buddha, and then to the bride's room to hold the nuptial ceremony. A whole sheep is placed on the table. The groom and bride break a bone of the sheep's leg, and then go outside to ride horses, circling the incense burner three times before inviting the groom back into the house to be seated. After the banquet is over, they return home with the original relatives, friends, and groomsmen. Then the woman's relatives and friends send the bride to the man's house (riding horses, sedan chairs, or cars are all acceptable). The invited godfather leads the new couple to kowtow to heaven, earth, and the kitchen god. After the bride kowtows to heaven, earth, and the kitchen god, she re-combs her hair, changes into women's clothes, and bows to her in-laws, worships the Buddha statue, and then bows to relatives and friends. Three days later, the woman's relatives and friends bring gifts to visit the bride, and within a week, the new couple returns to the bride's home to meet the relatives.</p>
<p>Divorce is extremely simple, without any formalities or procedures. If the two parties disagree and it is difficult to live together, either party only needs to state the reason for the divorce. With the consent of the couple, the reason can be explained to the woman's family at any time, and they are asked to take their daughter back, or the man sends someone to send her back. In this way, the divorce is announced. If there are children, most of them stay with the husband's family. If it is an infant who cannot be separated from the mother, the man negotiates and provides the woman with supplies for raising the child, such as cattle and horses. In the future, when the child grows up, there is a habit of the son returning to the father and the daughter returning to the mother.</p>
<h3>An Embarrassing Incident with the Guizhou Provincial Supervisor of Education: The Commissioner of Education Apologizes with a Letter</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 30th via Airmail] The Guizhou Provincial High School, the Second High School, the High School of Agriculture, and the teachers' associations of eight other schools recently requested that the provincial government quickly issue salaries for March and April at 1,500 times each, and requested that public grain and travel expenses be issued to meet urgent needs. Initially, no agreement was reached, resulting in a strike of nearly ten days. Among them, there was an interesting episode: when the faculty and staff of Guiyang Provincial High School were holding a meeting at the school preparing to propose a motion to the faculty and staff association, Supervisor He happened to arrive at the school. This official mistakenly thought that "representatives of various schools were secretly gathering at Guiyang High School to incite a strike," so he turned around and ran back to the Department of Education to report this important intelligence to his superiors. Commissioner Chuan Qixue, who has been excessively nervous recently due to the continuous strikes and demonstrations by college and middle school students, was like a startled bird and naturally believed the report to be true. He immediately went to the conference room of Guiyang High School and, without catching his breath, rudely roared at the faculty and staff who were meeting, without distinguishing between right and wrong. After he calmed down, Principal Liu Xunyu and the faculty and staff of the school felt unfairly wronged and retorted, asking Commissioner Chuan to open his eyes wide and see who in the room was a faculty or staff member of the other seven schools besides the faculty and staff of Guiyang High School. As a result of the counterattack, the principal took the lead and the entire staff resigned. The Commissioner knew that the incident was caused by ["erroneous intelligence"] and ["his own impatience"], so he immediately wrote a personal letter of apology the next day and sent the head of the secondary education section to apologize, saying that ["the recent stomach ailment has made emotions inconsistent and I deeply apologize to all the faculty and staff"]. It is reported that after the letter was formally read aloud by the principal to all the faculty, staff, and students, it was considered to be of great significance and was decided to be handed over to the literature class for filing and investigation as a historical document of the school. This is exactly the same as when he personally signed a guarantee a week later, in front of 5,000 students from the eight provincial high schools who were demonstrating and petitioning, standing in front of the provincial government and refusing to disperse, guaranteeing that all schools would resume classes regularly and permanently.</p>
<h3>Fenghua Declares Martial Law</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fenghua, 27th] The County Self-Defense Headquarters recently issued a notice announcing a special curfew every night from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>On the 26th, a group of bandits suddenly broke into the Song'ao Township Office. The township head was shot and wounded, and all the guns in the township office were taken away.</p>
<p>The handover ceremony between the new and old County Heads of this county, Fan Kuishu and Zhou Lingjun, was held on the morning of the 29th.</p>
<p>Liu Fugui, the warehouse manager of the County Land and Grain Office in Shangtian, lent all the levied grain to others for profit, so that those from various agencies and schools who went to collect it in recent days were all turned away empty-handed. Zhang Xianjun of the police station (now detained in the court detention center) had previously forged grain tickets, and now the same thing has happened again, so all the issued grain tickets have been rejected.</p>
<h3>A Specialty of Taizhou Fisheries: Songmen White Fish</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Correspondent, Li Tingbo</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wenling, 28th] Songmen is one of the fishing markets in Taizhou. Songmen's white fish is also one of Taizhou's specialties, famous far and wide, and comparable to Jinhua ham. Because the yellow croaker produced in the Songmen area is fat, fresh, and delicious, the white fish can also enjoy a great reputation. Also, because it is pickled properly, the color and aroma are better than white fish produced elsewhere. However, the production volume has been gradually decreasing every year. Before the war, the annual output was 50,000 to 60,000 catties, which were sold to Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Hankou, Fuzhou, and Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, and Sichuan. In recent years, due to the decline of the fishing industry, fishermen's fishing is old-fashioned, the equipment is simple, and prices continue to skyrocket, fishermen's lives are difficult, and they cannot organize, repair, or add equipment, so the output has also decreased significantly, with only 30,000 to 40,000 catties per year.</p>
<p>The method of making white fish is that fishermen catch fresh yellow croaker during the tidal season and immediately split it into white fish embryos on the fishing boat or on a nearby small island. The splitting method uses a small sharp blade to split the yellow croaker from the head straight to four inches from the tail. Then bend the back of the fish slightly, take out the internal organs, separate it, and slightly flatten it. Then use a large amount of salt to pickle them one by one. After one or two days, take them out, wash them, and place them on straw to be exposed to the scorching sun. If it doesn't rain, you don't have to take it back, and let it be exposed to the night dew, which makes it taste even fresher. After drying for four or five days, it can be packed and sold to various places.</p>
<p>The characteristics of white fish are that because the famous Songmen white fish is different from the white fish produced elsewhere, it has its own characteristics. The so-called white fish is not completely white. The characteristic of white fish is that all the pectoral fins are combined and closely attached to the abdomen, and the caudal fin is not forked. The whole body has fine scales, the color is shiny, except for the abdomen, pectoral fins, and caudal fin, which are slightly golden, the rest is grayish-white. If you look closely, the golden color emits a faint glow, and the taste is fresh and delicious, and it is popular with everyone. When cooking tofu soup, adding a few slices of white fish meat will make the taste even fresher, while those produced elsewhere and dyed imitations, the scales will never glow, and the taste and color are different, and the pectoral fins and caudal fins are also different.</p>
<p>The storage method is simple. The storage method is quite simple: (1) Remove the fish eyes, because the mold of white fish always starts from the fish eyes and reaches the whole body, turning a good fish all red, and the taste is completely lost. (2) Dry thoroughly before storing. The boneless abdomen should be exposed to the sun when drying. (3) The storage place should have little ventilation and should be dry. Because white fish contains a lot of salt, it is easy to get damp and change color and mold if placed in a place with high temperature. It is best to store the fish in a granary or wheat storage, which will not spoil it, because dry grains and wheat can absorb moisture, so even if there is a high temperature, it will not be affected and will not spoil.</p>
<p>The production season of white fish is all year round, and the best quality is the Fu Fish, "Qiu Fu is a solar term around the seventh lunar month to mid-month," and Fu Fish is divided into Chu Fu, Er Fu, and San Fu, with San Fu being the best quality. During San Fu, the yellow croaker can eat the water along the coast of Songmen, so it is particularly fat and tender, and the taste is particularly fresh. The made white fish is particularly famous, because at this time, the weather is dry and the sun is strong, making it easy to dry the white fish, so drying the white fish also depends on the weather.</p>
<h3>Qingdao-Shanghai Transportation Price Adjustment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 2nd] The Qingdao Shipping Association adjusted passenger and freight rates from the 1st. The new prices are as follows: Qingdao-Shanghai line, first class passenger ticket 18.1 yuan, first class 12.2 yuan, freight 9.5 yuan per ton, motorized sailing ship 8.5 yuan per ton, Qingdao to Fuzhou, Keelung line, first class passenger ticket 36.7 yuan, first class 24.4 yuan, freight 11.7 yuan per ton.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 2nd] This asked the Sui District to order all shipping agencies to maintain normalcy and not to withdraw on any pretext. All route shipping must continue to be maintained even in the midst of great difficulties. All air transport conditions should also be reported at any time in accordance with previous regulations.</p>
<h3>Chongming Fishing Season: Fishing Boats Fully Loaded</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongming, 28th] This year's fishing season, only Baozhen Port and Shi Qiao River are open. The fishing boats that sailed to the Yellow Sea to catch yellow croaker in the first fishing season have returned one after another. In recent months, the war situation has changed drastically, and people are worried about the order on the sea, but unexpectedly it is more peaceful than in the past. It is said that pirates cannot gain a foothold in the Yellow Sea and have moved to other places. The large sum of "peace money" carried by the fishing boats was actually returned intact. However, the currency value has plummeted. Although it was not given to the pirates, it has already been discounted greatly. The fishermen ran ashore to ask about the price of the goods and were stunned.</p>
<p>Every year there are two fishing seasons. Last year, just after the first fishing season, a spring thunder suddenly came. The fishermen said that when spring thunder sounds, the yellow croaker dives into the deep sea and cannot be caught. Therefore, the second fishing season last year returned empty-handed. These many missed fish have lived an extra year. This year's first fishing season is particularly abundant, and the wind and waves were calm when the fishing boats were at sea, making it easy to cast nets, so all the boats returned fully loaded.</p>
<p>Chongming people love to eat yellow croaker, and the way of eating is very particular. The fish is washed, dried, and pickled in sweet distiller's grains. It can be stored for a long time without spoiling. It is sweet, fragrant, and delicious. Just smelling the taste makes your mouth water, so every family has to buy dozens or hundreds of catties when the fishing boats arrive. In the past, Qidong people also hired small boats to Chongming to wholesale and sell them back, and the harbor was crowded with people. However, the situation has changed greatly this year. Not only have the Qidong people disappeared, but even the local people are sighing at the fish due to the extreme shortage of funds. After several discussions, the fishermen had to implement barter. One pile of fish (about 20 catties) was exchanged for fourteen skeins of 3-ply yarn, or three catties of flowered cloth. In this way, the stalemate was finally broken.</p>
<p>After the first season's yellow croaker is exchanged, the second season can be caught in the Yellow Sea starting from the 28th or 29th.</p>
