<p>〔中央社靑島四日電〕南京人民和平代表團代表吳裕後，四日晨以私人關係與共方葉劍英通話達半小時，得悉北平籌備歡迎不及，且機塲電訊設備尙未修復，四日無法降落。</p>

<p>劉氏又稱：「余不信靑島在二星期中將有任何重大變化，此間一切謠傳，均不足置信。」渠同意靑島市參議會議長李代芳所稱目前國共雙方均無在靑島作戰而毀減該市的理由，劉氏稱；渠本人及渠所統率的軍隊，仍接受南京政府的命令。又稱：渠並未從事或計劃仿傚北平的傅作議，而締結地方協定，終止戰事，將該市轉交共方之手。渠且已奉令在共軍進攻時保衛靑島，但在未被攻擊前，渠認為並無使靑島捲入內戰屠殺的理由。</p>
<p>劉氏復稱：關於美國西太平洋艦隊總部的遷離靑島，卽為共軍進攻靑島的信號之說，不足置信。劉氏估計：在靑島西·北·東三面佈成二十英哩至四十英哩的弧形圈的共軍，約三十萬人，其中二十萬為正規部隊，十萬為民兵·渠拒絕透露靑島國軍的總數，但據可靠方面估計，目前約在七萬左右。</p>
<p>劉氏並指斥國軍正計劃逐步自海上撤出靑島的謠傳為無稽。按該項消息稱：國重將在二月十五日前完全撤出，以待共軍和平接收，該日為美國西太平洋艦隊總部撤離後的第二日或第三日。按白吉爾中將宣佈，渠之總部預定在以後十日至十二日之間，乘厄爾多利多號旗艦離此。</p>
<h3>豫南共軍大部北撤　國軍會合團隊收復匯潢川　浦口浦鎭秩序全復常態</h3>
<p>〔本報信陽四日電〕軍息：豫南共軍自二日起，大部經中遂平北撤，動向未明，現駐馬店確山周圍卅華里內已無匪蹤。另息：豫南國軍四日會合團隊，一舉收復平漢東側之潢川，九區專署及潢川縣政府已隨軍返縣城辦公。又，犯光山土共，五日亦回竄經扶，固始。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口四日電〕此間盛傳許昌·鄭州共軍已相繼開始北撤，但據剿總發言人稱，此說迄未證實。另據平漢路息：許昌共軍確有向北移動模樣。</p>
<p>〔本報浦鎭四日電〕津浦路南段以共軍主力遠在嘉山以北，且自春節以來，國共兩軍始終在烏衣附近成膠狀態，故兩（浦鎭浦口）地區秩序已全復常態，過去居民之逃往江南者現什九皆已歸來，各安生業。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕據悉：六合城內現駐有土共江淮軍區東南支隊六百餘，六合以南瓜埠鎭駐三百餘，六合東南濱江之大河口附近駐七百餘，連日正向民間强征所謂担柴及公糧。又揚州方面國共兩軍仍在城南三叉河及施家橋之綫對峙，揚州駐有中共縣長顧維衡所部土共四百餘。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江四日電〕揚州六合綫無戰事，國共雙方仍在施家橋對峙中。口岸，三江營，瓜洲，十二圩，儀微仍在國軍手中。此間自三日恢復鎮瓜，鎭圩，鎭泗班輪後，連日渡江往北者較南來者為多，江邊擁擠現象較前稍好，鎭江城防業由第四軍王作華部接防。又悉：南通情况不明，此間電信局已無法與該地取得聯絡。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京四日電〕親政府方面四日稱：共軍對南京之壓力現暫時放鬆，國軍已重佔南通。共軍撤離威脅長江北岸一帶國軍橋頭堡壘之陣地，外籍觀察家認係在作「進攻前之大整編」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京四日電〕南京區域今日並無軍事活動，政府軍顯然繼續避免與共軍接觸。共軍方面之大部份行動均為局部性質，因陳毅部隊主力又在江北休止，從事整編。整個國防部似已離開南京，軍事活動完全在京滬杭警備總司令湯恩伯手中。聞周至柔等日內亦將赴華南。</p>
<p>首都兩浦間交通正常　下　站行車秩序恢復</p>
<p>〔中央社東京四日電〕記者今晨曾赴長江對岸之橋頭堡浦口·浦鎭間巡視，輪渡上往返之旅客，除軍人外，多係小販，且由甫北渡者，尤多遄赴江北探視故居之難民。兩浦之間安靖如常，通行無阻，士兵加强工事，為唯一之戰時景象。鄕民仍悠然家居，度其新春麗日。記者旋折返下關，更往京滬車站一視，行車秩序已吿恢復，上下行各次列車準時可以開達，舊歷年前因疏散而形成之擁擠情况，以及滿站台之箱籠什物，均已無存，惟往來旅客仍以單帮客為多，手携背肩五洋雜貨或猪油鷄子之類，但彼輩已非年前之豪華，僅購乘三等客票，以節成本，故頭二等車已不若以前之擁塞。下關與城內因江南首都兩路公共汽車之復駛，亦吿暢通，故南京除人口稍形减少外，一般情形均屬正常。</p>

<h3>趕快抑平物價！</h3>
<p>新春開市以來，上海的物價，又像一匹說疆的野馬，狂奔亂跳，幾乎無法抑制。這次物價的漲風，雖由金融性的商品如黃金·美鈔·銀元黑市的領導而展開，但漲勢最暴倍數最多的，却是民生日常用品。尤其是食米一項，漲得太驚人了！春節前，，食米售價不過一千五百元左右，但至前日，米市塲漲至六關，鬥市零售均在六千元之上，食米在短短的五六天內，竟漲起了四倍多，教一般升斗小民以及薪水階級怎不聞訊色變呢？中央以及市政當局不論為體念民生的艱苦着想，或為確保地方治安打算，對於米價的狂漲，實在不容袖手旁觀了！</p>
<p>最可恥的，政府大員只被和平之聲冲昏了頭腦，求燒的求饒，搬遷的搬遷，却把眼前分內應該快做的大事倒遺忘了。物價如此狂漲，當局似還無動於中。以往中樞為了物價問題，往往還手忙脚亂一陣，而目前則手脚並不為物價而動，却只忙在搬塲疏散，好像千千萬萬老百姓的生活不比他們的生命重要。忽而嚷着拋售物資，忽而又不拋了，我們眞不懂肉食之徒幹些什麼！</p>
<p>據報載。。吳市長對於米價狂漲頗為震怒，曾命令米業負責人將南北米市塲成交的食米全部取銷，並嚴格規定市塲白粳價格每石不得超過四千五百元，門售每斗不得超過四百八十元：同時又限制市民憑身份證購米，一次以五升為限。吳市長採取這種緊急措置，未可厚非，但辦法能否收效，仍是一個嚴重問題。昨日米市塲仍未開市，各米店又陷於半停頓狀態，這個嚴重的民食問題依舊沒有獲得解決，使社會各階層的人民英不感受這「白米恐怖」的威脅·</p>
<p>我們以純學理的眼光來分析這次物價暴漲的原因，不外乎下列三項：第一是因爲時局動盪不定。南北交通旣已阻隔不通，經濟區域也就不免割裂。北方的金圓券一舉而入於中共之手，透過了商人，排山倒海而南來，頓使上海市塲為游資所泛濫。首都為了政府要遷移廣州，各部會的人員，聚集上海，準備南下，在南京的游資也隨着流至上海。廣東湖南兩省又提出發行地方貨幣的建議，使素來重物輕幣的上海人，對於金圓券的信用，更要大打折扣了。再以上海本身而論，和乎？戰乎？誰也不敢輕下斷語，益使人心浮動，反映到金融市塲，有如火上加油，更使物價漲風，一發而不可抑制。</p>
<p>第二是金圓券發行額的激增。在去年八月間實行改革幣制之初，全國朝野奐不期望幣制改革之後，勿再濫發貨幣，千萬不可使三百萬對一的金圓券，於若干時日之後，又變成了被改革的法幣，故一致主張要加强金圓劵發行準備委員會的職責，將金圓參的發行額及其準備，按月公開發表，以昭大信·但沒有幾個月，該會就變為名存實亡，痲終正寢。薇至目前為止，金無劵究已候行了多少，離也不知道這個殯數。但憑常議判斷，目下金圓劵發行的累積總額，着實可觀。別的不說，單以春節前後的軍政費用的大量膨脹而論，也就為數不少了。同時，金圓券的流通區域又逐漸縮小，平津巳不流通，乃紛紛南流，首當其面的上海，便成為游資的逃避所。如此，物價怎能不暴漲？</p>
<p>第三是政府對於洶湧而來的游資竟未採取任何對策。當局對於春節後的物價，也早已料及其必漲，且揚言於新春開市之日，決以拋售物資的辦法來抽緊銀根，使物價不致狂漲。起初各業也無不戒懼，紅盤開出並不太高。但至近午，各業未見政府有拋售物資的事實表現出來，因此物價便一哄而上，造成這次空前未有的漲風·</p>
<p>由上所述，第一個因素大局動盪不安，造成這次物價的狂漲，因非當局所能挽回；但是當局擁有大批物資，說拋不拋，聽任游資在上海泛濫，使物價一日數漲，在我們人民看來，不論負責當局如何解釋，終難辭其咎的。我們要奉吿當局，物價如若再漲下去，人民太苦了，再也活不下去；除非政府不要收拾人心，否則就應該趕快以全力來抑平物價。不然的話，這樣泄沓無能的政府，不要說備戰守江將受絕大影響，就是靦顏求和，也未必為對方所重視，其結果非拖垮自己不止！</p>

<h3>蘇聯授意德報披露　和平建議七條件　柏林問題爲東西鬥爭關鍵</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕美官員四日拒絕蘇聯最近授意的七點「和平計劃」，並坦白宣稱，在蘇聯未解除柏林封鎖之前，會戰仍將繼續。最近的和平建議係由蘇聯控制的柏林報紙提出，該報列舉其認為對解決東西爭議最主要的七項條件</p>
<p>此七項條件為：（一）撤退美國在希臘駐軍，（二）撤退美國在韓國駐軍，（三）接受蘇聯的裁軍計劃，（四）放棄北大西洋安全公約，（五）延遲建立西德國計劃，（六）改變西方國家在柏林的政策，（七）變更西方國家對魯爾的計劃。美外交官員稱，此等建議「荒謬而愚蠢」，他們指出蘇聯實「無意執行任何行動」。官員稱，整個東西鬥爭的關鍵在於柏林。除非蘇聯放棄以武力迫使美·英·法退出柏林的企圖，解決一切問題的誠意談判實無從開始。因為蘇聯正賴藉其柏林封鎖，企圖突破目前的西方警戒綫，控制全德國，並在事實上控制全部西歐。官方並宣稱，無論如何西方國家不將放棄柏林</p>

<h3>晨友杯重決賽　回力三分受挫　晨友勝第一仗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕晨友杯籃球賽甲組冠軍重決，回力對晨友，三賽兩勝，第一戰昨晚七時半假市體育館舉行。回力以三分敗北，結果六十五比六十二分。晨友一路領先，上半時三十七比二十一分。回力上半時失分太多，下半時雖十分努力，卒難超越。視最後五分鐘之表演，回力殊有回生之望，卒無法挽救，頗為觀衆惋惜。體育館昨晚相當熱鬧，觀衆五千人以上。回力昨以王永芳曾永吉最為努力，惜全隊似現慌張失常，投籃機會甚多，殊欠把握，尤以三十次之罰球，僅中十二分。晨友傳球之快速與合作之純熟，實為回力所不及，籃下球晨友亦居主動地位，回力多賴遠射得分，上半時曾一度追成十比九惜斯時不能超越，遂屈居人下，以至於終。晨友首戰友利，且看第二仗。</p>

<h3>明日將召開理事會議　證交復業爲期不遠　人事問題可於會議席上決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據確息：醞釀多時之本市證券交易所復業問題，一二日內卽可有端倪，財工兩部負責人士，業已口頭通知證交當局，行政院上月廿六日第四十一次會議所通過之上海證券交易所復業辦法十一條，巳正式頒送該所，預計今日當可寄到。設復業辦法如期寄到，該所卽將於明日召開常務理事會議，以便根據復業辦法之條文，完成一切必要之復業凖備，確定復業日期。同時，對該所之人事問題，將作一最後之決定。</p>
<p>該所復業後，其上市之證券，按規定有：（一）政府債券，（二）國營事業股票，（三）民營公司股票三種。除第一二兩種證券之上市，由財工兩部另以命令定之外，原已上市之民營公司股票卅一種，雖多未呈准變更登記，惟新規定對該項股票上市之買賣，認為係轉讓之預約，故證交復業後，當卽可繼續上市買賣。惟根據規定，該項股票，，仍須於證交復業之日起，於三個月內，完成變更登記程序。</p>
<p>又訊：該所之人事問題，除原任總經理王志莘業已辭職照准外，原任主任秘書華文煜辭呈亦經王志莘批准。原任協理楊蔭溥向理事會請辭未准，刻仍堅辭中。新任總經理顧善昌，則迄未接事，正候明日常務理事會席上作一最後之決定。至該所同人，除三分之一早巳接受資遣外，刻尙留一百餘人，聞復業後將暫維緊縮，不添新人云。</p>
<h3>僑滙牌價取消</h3>
<p>僑匯牌價，中央銀行，已於昨日宣吿取消。五日起僑胞匯款，概憑移轉證市價折付金圓券。關於僑匯牌價取消一事，據中央銀行當局表示，取消原因，係以僑匯牌價，低於外匯證價格，業巳失其意義，特予廢止。</p>
<p>外匯移轉證券，四日市再升，晨開六〇〇元，交易趨濃，午收高至七〇〇元，較三日漲高二〇○元。</p>
<h3>外埠匯款湧到　銀根鬆勢延續</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根鬆勢，依然延續。中央銀行，仍少物資拋售，而各方因物價連日疾升過甚，買戶咸抱觀望，需單寥落，暗息在日拆卅元至卅五元間徘徊。行莊多單如毛，紛紛挫拆客戶，故市塲週轉，極見靈動。又訊：現鈔籌碼仍裕，且流通者均多為五十元券，百元券則仍有人搜求，聞貼水微有做開，僅為每百一元。</p>
<p>據金融界人士稱，連日外埠頭寸，或以匯票，或以現鈔運抵本市者，日達三四十億無之譜。中央銀行新春以來，交換均見差出，原因卽在於此。又訊：銀錢業存款總額，昨日估計，已在五十億元上下，數額雖較過去有增，但與物價比較，則實較前為减。</p>
<h3>食油禁止出口　暫以一月爲期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於食油及其原料暫停由滬出口一事，業由江海關於二日公吿在案。茲該關昨又補行公吿，該項暫停出口辦法，應自本年二月二日起，以一個月為期。</p>
<h3>銀樓要求復業　正在商訂辦法</h3>
<p>據財部發言人稱：銀樓業要求復業呈文，經金管局轉至財部後，現經會同工商部擬定較具體辦法，一俟提請政務會議通過，當可公佈施行。黃金短期公債之發行已無問題，現正等待基金監理委員會之成立，一俟該委會宣吿成立，卽可定期發行。</p>
<h3>成本高於限價　米市塲交易停頓　當局昨按限價拋米五千右</h3>
<p>米市交易，昨日南北二市塲均無開出，因當局限價每石（一五〇斤）不得超過四千五百元連佣，但貨主因產地價高，及百物昂貴，成本高於限價，故無人售出，南北二市塲均無做開，市陷入停頓狀態，市塲報價亦停。又當局於昨日臨收市，在南北二市塲各拋米二千五百石，按限價共拋五千石，但因手續下及，未卽分配予米店。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>漲風未戢，老車喊價突破三千大關，經市塲某負責人力勸同業切勿高抬，初市升至二千七百五十元後，卽未見成交，兵船疾升六百元，臨收亦以二千七百五十元做開，紅蜂成交不多，建成未開出，其他各牌粉一律勁升三成左右。麩皮漲勢持續，福新大包一度突破二千關，臨收略見回小以千九百三十元成交。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>奔胱朱已，生仁以油價猛升，油廠納進不遣餘力，人心堅昂，市勢扶搖直上，各貨普升七成餘，齊越萬元大關。黃豆貨奇缺，執戶扳抬，乍豆再漲二成，苞米先疲後堅，較前微升二百元，芝蔴貨主扳持不放，未見做開。紅糧菉豆齊漲，揀靑急叩五千關。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>昨市漲勢稍緩，終仍見略升，開市甚遲，價甚緊俏，收市因業外價平，故亦轉疲。豆油先做三萬三千，收市三萬一千，軋升二千元，吉桶生油三萬八千元，浄生油亦三萬八千元，漲四千元，生菜油二萬六千，計挺二千。淸油及熟菜油初堅後平，與昨彷彿，豆餅漲四五百元。</p>
<h3>棉紗繼續猛漲　布市由堅趨軟</h3>
<p>棉紗昨市况繼續猛漲，初開美援會仍將掛牌拋售，人心略有顧忌，開盤時市勢尙平，嗣後未見拋售，檯面又起哄抬，細紗又漲三萬元，粗紗亦漲二五〇〇〇元</p>
<p>四十二藍鳳晨開初喊三三〇〇〇〇賣出，喊後走勢軟弱，本街帮觀望不前，執戶情虛，頻有了售，市勢卽軟，喊價低至二七。二八萬元，低後實銷又動，納胃轉健，市氣再轉鋒俏，午收三二萬，軋升三萬元。</p>
<p>二十一支雙馬，晨開二十萬賣出，人心似尙平疲，價卽回小萬元，嗣因拋紗人員未日蒞塲，胆氣稍壯，塲上納冐又起，喊高至二二萬元，高後浮多有了，市勢稍平，迄午以二十萬元了結，升二五〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>棉布昨賡續昻挺，市勢堅後稍露軟意，廣帮以海關卽將執行限制棉布南運禁令，淮意轉懈，同業則出現淮期，套賣頗多，散戶以喊價已高，買風淡消，故臨收微見虛卻。</p>
<p>四君子嗶嘰以六八〇〇元開盤，開後仍一路上揚，至十時許一度升至七九〇〇元，嗣瞬卽回小在七四〇〇元邊，徘徊良久，終以七一〇〇元午收，較上日再漲六〇〇元，金蓮妙舞嗶嘰，自七五百元盤降至七二〇〇元，跳鯉元灰光料，均以四五〇〇元收巿。</p>
<p>龍頭細布曾出八千元大關，旋退至七五〇〇元，龍頭B細布起伏亦劇，自六四〇〇元上挺至七一〇〇元，卒為六六〇〇元，漲一千一百元。中檔細布如喇叭童，五福B大雙龍等，均出六千元關外，成交尙繁。</p>
<p>桐油上揚</p>
<p>桐油昨市晨開卽吿翔翔，且漲風之猛烈，有若脫韁野馬，緣因同業頭寸泛濫，並以結匯移轉證繼續踊躍，人心激挺，市上一片買聲，絡繹不絕，市面急遽進展，交易亦頗精采。</p>
<p>更正昨日本版「外晚證猛升」一條後，誤將第一版「外記者看中國」消息中第五段以下文字拚入，致前後不符，合亟更正</p>
<h3>紗布南運問題　工商部長認爲不宜嚴格限制</h3>
<p>關於限制紗布南運一事，民營紗廠紛紛反對。當局以此舉流弊至多，亦愼重考慮，短期內將不致實行。記者昨以此事叩詢工商部長劉維熾氏，據稱，經濟措施之目的，理應兼顧全國共同一致之利益，不宜作一時一地之打算，任何割裂行為，均將造成損害全國經濟利益之後果。股鑒不遠，母待贅述。故在理論上講，紗布不特應准南運，尤需鼓勵運銷全國。且紗布南運向為國家外匯收入之大宗，而華南各省人民衣着需要，亦向賴上海供給。復以目前紗布南運之動機，多為保存資財之安全，際此時局動盪，亦屬無可厚非。故本人認為紗布南運，在目前情况下，不宜作無條件之限制，而應在不影響本市需要量之範圍內，儘可能加以開放，以利經濟交流，促進繁榮，此亦本市紡織工業為維持生存所迫切希望者。據悉本市紡織工業前晚復推派代表多人謁見劉氏，籲請開放外銷，劉氏對紡織業之苦衷，表示願予誠意考慮。</p>

<h3>杭城春節後　「文化城」建議　進行熱烈討論</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州三日訊〕春節以後，因着首都各機關的疏散。杭州——江南安靜的地區也顯得紛紛然了。軍隊的不斷過境與駐紮，營地不敷，徵用民房，城站一帶的民居多多少少被徽用了。湖濱一帶，住慣舒服房舍的人，在無可奈何下，也只得讓他們的房屋，讓陌生的軍人居住。</p>
<p>滬杭車</p>
<p>絕對沒有定時，一位朋友自上海來，高興的對記者說：「我很幸運，總算走了十小時」。有一天，滬杭各站的站務人員都躱開了，原因為了什麼？也不容記者加以贅述。交通如此，更有何話可說？因此，滬上報紙來杭州隔一天是最迅速的事，否則起碼隔上兩天，人心安得不慌亂？</p>
<p>素稱恬靜逸適的天堂人民，面對着眼前的現實，也不免感覺有些沉重起來。最足表現的，就是物價的波動，飾金黑市到金圓五萬元以上，袁大頭也要千元以上，米衝破了三關，捲烟更是上漲了三倍，百物隨着奔騰，三四倍不止。商店鑑於亂，鑑於漲，無辦法之下，只有趁這農曆新年，多休息幾天。今天應該是農曆的年初六，「接過財神」後兩日了，然而店家沒有意思開門的很多，市面上感到一抹蕭條的景色。</p>
<p>小轎車</p>
<p>突然增多了，而　是最漂亮的流綫裏的，卡車，吉普車，一律增加。凡是「〇〇」號的汽車，交通警察都只得另眼相看，因為車主們往往將首都比杭州，不諳杭州的交通規則，什麼單行道全不在話下，要走便得走，橫衝，直撞，簡直不像樣兒。</p>
<p>大旅社</p>
<p>信滿了帶着「京」氣的豪客們，一擲萬金的大有人在，他們雖然是疏散，但比安住在杭州的人們要闊得多。不過，還有一些人，受着命令疏散的人，却够可憐了，躑躅在街頭，買一個大餅也要躊躇一番，提挈着妻兒老小，前途茫茫，正不知何時為止。因此，只要天氣不下雨，馬路上總是塞滿着人，他們雖然是閒逛，但心情是拉緊的，惶惶然不可終日。他們住的地方是擠無可擠，吃的東西是簡無可簡，空下來，除了逛馬路簡直無事可為。疲勞與煩悶充溢在每一個人的臉龐上。</p>
<p>酒菜館</p>
<p>也有幸與不幸之別，有的接着好主顧，數千萬金一擲卽是，有的接着窮朋友，分文無着也有的。不過，在交通機構附近的往往是接待了後者，而在名勝區附近的往往接待了前者。接待後者的店家，怨聲載道，接待前者的店家，笑逐顏開。</p>
<p>在過路的人擁塞在杭州的時候，衛生也成了當前很嚴重的問題，隨地便溺，臭氣四溢，都已是司空見慣。</p>
<p>在慌慌亂亂的情况下，居然還有一羣</p>
<p>書　子</p>
<p>在討論建設杭州爲文化的都城。那是本報杭州辦事處的第六次文藝晚會席上提出的課題，各個大學的敎授，藝術家，文化界，新聞記者，幾同聲一致的要求杭州建設為文化城，雖然現在是兵荒馬亂，但為了杭州的百年大計，為了杭州的將來命運，他們都有同一的看法，同一的要求。</p>
<p>杭市參議會，為了配合着他們所提出的「不設防城市」，於是也有建杭州為文化城的提出。在他們的檢討會上，曾經邀請主張建設杭州最力的張其　敎授和記者兩人出席演講。我們在分析杭州市的自然環境與歷史傳統以及今後的趣向以後，他們也就決定了今後杭州的建設應以文化為中心。</p>
<p>配合着這個建設杭州為</p>
<p>文化城</p>
<p>的召喚，很多劇團都在杭州演出話劇，最近中國劇薩社演出了「欽差大臣」，接着便是靑年軍劇藝社的「釵頭鳳」，接着又是戲劇節各劇團的戲劇展覽，接着又是春秋旅行劇團的「沉淵」，接着接着……文化活動是多起來了，我們儘需要各種不同門類文化活動的配合，不論是「文化城」的理想何時實現，但我們旣已確定了方向，總該不斷地向這個方向努力。</p>
<h3>濟南一聯中　在長安開課</h3>
<p>〔本報長安鎭三日訊〕長安鎭國立濟南一聯中，收容着兩千多個山東逃出來的流亡學生，分住在該鎭連元絲廠及長安絲廠內。這批流亡學生中，有不少還只是十三四歲的小孩子，他們衣單被薄，飽嚐了流浪的苦味，幸賴政府及地方多方協助，才使他們免除凍餒之憂。舊曆年長安絲廠並捐贈白米三石，叫學生們打牙祭，前時絲廠曾捐給學生兩千五百雙襪子，足證學生們和地方人士感情極融洽。目前該校正積極籌備上課，敎職負已聘到了一百多位，並已存糧一月，二月初旬正式上課。</p>
<h3>鎭江捕銀元販子　鬧市叮噹聲絕響</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江四日訊〕地方當局對於銀元販早有取締，無如執行忽張忽弛，春節前後，鎭市此種「職業者」更多，甚至敎師亦有臨時幹此生涯的，閙市一片叮噹之聲，年初二「袁大頭」高至九百八十元，初四下跌，昨天（二月二日）又漲至一千一百五，各業紅盤雖未開出，暗市莫不根據「袁大頭」挺升，治安當局三日又開始捕追「銀元阪子」，午後各馬路閙市，叮噹盈耳之銀元聲，已吿絕響。</p>

<h3>The Two Peace Delegations from Nanjing and Shanghai Will Fly to Beiping Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 4th] The Nanjing People's Peace Delegation was still unable to depart on the 4th. A representative of the delegation told reporters: This morning, we spoke with Ye Jianying in Beiping, who informed us of the following points: (1) The plane will take off at 2:00 PM on the 6th to come to Beiping. (2) We will communicate by telephone at 9:00 AM that morning. (3) Reporters need not come, as all news agencies here have reporters. (4) The plane will land at Nanyuan Airport. According to sources from the China National Aviation Corporation here, CNAC has designated Yin Huaxi, not Ao Shipeng, as the person in charge in Beiping. The Beiping telephone said that the company's telegram was already sealed and cannot be contacted. If this difficulty cannot be resolved, it is impossible to risk flying. It has now been reported to the head office for instructions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 4th] Wu Yu-hou, a representative of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, spoke with the Communist Party's Ye Jianying on the morning of the 4th for half an hour through private channels. He learned that Beiping was not prepared to welcome them in time, and the airport's communication equipment had not yet been repaired, making it impossible to land on the 4th.</p>
<p>[City News] China National Aviation Corporation has decided to send a special plane to Qingdao on the 6th to carry the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation to Beiping.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Jiang Yong, and others from the Peace Delegation are scheduled to fly to Beiping from Shanghai on the 6th. Gan Jiehou, the personal representative of Acting President Li, and Shao Lizi have also decided to go. Mr. Gan returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 4th and immediately went to see Acting President Li to report. Around 11:00 AM, he visited Shao Lizi again to discuss matters concerning going to Beiping, and returned to Shanghai by plane at 12:30 PM. According to sources close to Acting President Li, Yan, Zhang, and others' visit to Beiping has received a response from Beiping on a personal level. In addition to meeting with Ye Jianying and others, they will also travel to other regions based on developments in Beiping to meet with Communist Party leader Mao Zedong and others, convey the government's sincerity in seeking peace, and knock on the door of peace.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Shao Lizi said on the evening of the 4th that he agreed to go to Beiping with Yan and others, but this trip does not represent the government and is only in the capacity of a personal representative. He is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 6th to wait for the plane to go together.</p>
<p>Shanghai Delegation Members Can Be Fully Decided Today</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The members of the Shanghai Peace Delegation need to be rearranged due to environmental and personal intentions. In addition to Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong, who have decided to fly to Beiping to conduct peace explorations, Leng Yuqiu is unable to spare time due to the upcoming session of the Provincial Assembly. Another representative, Chen Guangfu, a financial magnate in the city, also recently expressed no intention of going north. According to sources close to Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen has devoted his life to the financial industry and has always lacked interest in politics. Therefore, when Acting President Li came to Shanghai to personally invite him, he politely declined. As for the consultations in recent days, although Mr. Chen attended by invitation, it was only for the nature of friendly exchanges of opinions. Due to the changes in the members of the Peace Delegation, the date of departure for the north must be delayed by a day or two to look for new candidates in Shanghai. Gan Jiehou flew to Nanjing at 7:20 AM yesterday morning to see Acting President Li for instructions, and then flew back to Shanghai at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to contact all parties again regarding the members of the delegation. He had not returned to the hotel late at night. It is heard that the government is quite interested in inviting Liu Hongsheng to serve as a representative to fill the vacancy of Chen Guangfu. It is expected that the new candidates can be fully decided today. In addition to the five representatives, Shao Lizi will go to Beiping on the same plane to strive to directly negotiate with the Communist Party representatives and explore the true attitude of the Communist Party. It is uncertain whether Mr. Gan Jiehou will accompany him because he still has tasks in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Cheng Siyuan Arrives in Taipei to Represent Acting President Li in Visiting Chen Cheng, Seeking Opinions on the Current Situation, and Explaining Zhang Xueliang's Motives</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 4th] Legislator Cheng Siyuan arrived in Taipei by B-25 military plane at around 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. This trip was on behalf of Acting President Li and at the invitation of Chairman Chen to visit Taiwan. Mr. Cheng met with reporters at the Hubei Reception Center and said: This trip was under the instructions of Acting President Li, requesting him to seek Chairman Chen's opinions on the current situation and the reform of politics and economy. Acting President Li believes that at this time of crisis, it is imperative for the central government and local governments to unite as one. Regarding the Zhang Xueliang issue, Mr. Cheng said: In addition to the central government's release order, Acting President Li has a private telegram to Chairman Chen, and this time he will explain to Mr. Chen the motives and causes of this move by the central government. Regarding the peace issue, the central government is making its utmost efforts. Huang Qihan was sent to Beiping with a letter, but no progress has been made so far. Acting President Li is also trying to establish contact with Li Jishen, but personnel were sent to visit him, but he was nowhere to be found. At the moment, the central government's policy is to seek peace, but if peace cannot be achieved, it will never surrender, hoping that national public opinion can exert its strength to urge the Communist Party to eliminate prejudices. Mr. Cheng finally mentioned the US attitude, saying that Yu Bin met with President Truman in the United States and telegraphed Mr. Wu, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan, with Mr. Truman's opinion. Mr. Truman believes that the United States must support China's peace, but if peace is not attainable, the government still has the vast land south of the Yangtze River, and the United States will continue to assist the government until peace is achieved. Mr. Cheng will stay in Taiwan for about three to five days, and will meet with Chairman Chen tonight. It is also learned that Mr. Cheng also carries private letters to Weng Wenhao and Sun Lianzhong, hoping that the two will return to Nanjing as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Economic Cooperation Administration Decides to Stop Relief Work in Communist Areas</h3>
<p>Larkin Inspects Keelung Port Wharf</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] According to authoritative sources, the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) has been carrying out activities in the Communist-controlled areas of China in the past. Now the US has decided to stop economic relief for civilians in Communist areas. It is said that the ECA and the State Department recently jointly drafted a plan to continue to provide relief to the National Government areas that have recently been ravaged by the Communist Party, but senior US government officials have flatly rejected this proposal. ECA officials had expected the CCP to "cooperate" with the ECA to implement the civilian relief plan, but the US government, upon learning that the CCP had seized flour, cotton, and other economic cooperation materials in Tianjin, felt compelled to abandon this plan. If Beijing, Shanghai, and other places are also controlled by the Communist Party, the relief plans in those places will also be cancelled. In addition, Congress had originally planned to hear opinions on aid to China this month, but it has now decided to postpone it pending further developments in our country's political and military situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 4th] Larkin and his party arrived in Taiwan on the 3rd for inspection. On the 4th, they visited the Taipei Railway Factory and then went to Keelung to visit the wharf, shipyard, and fertilizer plant. In the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by Yan Jiagan and You Mijian. They took a fast train to Taichung at night to visit the Sun Moon Lake Power Plant. The China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration has decided to add an office in Taipei. More than 25 foreign technicians from its industrial construction team will come to Taiwan from Shanghai. They have already arrived in Taiwan to conduct inspections. Chieschel, the American planning engineer of the Taiwan Railway, has been very busy in recent days. It is said that his investigation report can be completed before March 1st. The US$1.5 million in US aid allocated to the Taiwan Railway Bureau will be allocated after Chieschel's investigation report is sent to the US Economic Cooperation Administration for approval.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Between Beijing and Nanjing Still Open</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] It is learned that the telegraph and telephone communication circuits between the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau and the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau are still open.</p>
<h3>Liu Anqi Talks to Foreign Reporters: Qingdao National Army Will Not Withdraw; No Local Agreements Ever Planned</h3>
<p>[Gourlay, China Branch Director, United Press, Qingdao, 4th] General Liu Anqi, the last commander in North China who can command the National Army that has not surrendered or been surrounded, told United Press on the 4th that the Communist Army will not immediately attack Qingdao. However, he also warned that once the Communist leaders give the order, the 300,000 Communist troops around Qingdao may launch a general offensive.</p>
<p>Liu also said: "I don't believe there will be any major changes in Qingdao in two weeks. All the rumors here are not credible." He agreed with Li Daifang, Chairman of the Qingdao Municipal Council, that neither the Nationalists nor the Communists currently have any reason to fight in Qingdao and destroy the city. Liu said that he and the troops under his command still accept orders from the Nanjing government. He also said that he has not engaged in or planned to emulate Fu Zuoyi of Beiping and conclude local agreements to end the war and hand over the city to the Communists. He has also been ordered to defend Qingdao in the event of a Communist attack, but he believes that there is no reason to involve Qingdao in the civil war massacre before it is attacked.</p>
<p>Liu also said that the claim that the US Western Pacific Fleet headquarters' departure from Qingdao would be a signal for the Communist Army to attack Qingdao is not credible. Liu estimates that the Communist Army, which is deployed in an arc of 20 to 40 miles on the west, north, and east sides of Qingdao, has about 300,000 troops, of which 200,000 are regular troops and 100,000 are militia. He declined to disclose the total number of National Army troops in Qingdao, but reliable sources estimate that it is currently around 70,000.</p>
<p>Liu also denounced the rumors that the National Army is planning to gradually withdraw from Qingdao by sea as groundless. According to the news, the country will completely withdraw before February 15, pending the peaceful takeover by the Communist Army. That day is the second or third day after the US Western Pacific Fleet headquarters leaves here. It is reported that Lieutenant General Badger announced that his headquarters is scheduled to leave here on the flagship USS Eldorado in the next ten to twelve days.</p>
<h3>Major Communist Forces in Southern Henan Retreat Northward; Nationalist Troops and Local Forces Recapture Huangkouchuan; Order Fully Restored in Pukou and Puzhen</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xinyang, 4th] Military news: Communist forces in southern Henan began a major retreat north through Suiping on the 2nd. Their movements are unclear. Currently, there is no trace of bandits within 30 li of Zhumadian and Queshan. Another report: Nationalist troops in southern Henan, together with local forces, recaptured Huangchuan, east of the Ping-Han Railway, on the 4th. The Ninth District Commissioner's Office and the Huangchuan County Government have returned to the county seat with the troops to resume work. Additionally, local communists who attacked Guangshan also fled back through Fu and Gushi on the 5th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 4th] It is widely rumored here that Communist forces in Xuchang and Zhengzhou have successively begun retreating north. However, according to the spokesman of the剿匪 General Headquarters, this has not yet been confirmed. Another report from the Ping-Han Railway: Communist forces in Xuchang do indeed appear to be moving northward.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Puzhen, 4th] With the main Communist forces far north of Jiashan and the Nationalist and Communist forces in a stalemate near Wuyi since the Spring Festival, order has been fully restored in both the Puzhen and Pukou areas. The majority of residents who fled to the south of the Yangtze River in the past have now returned, and are living and working in peace.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 4th] It is reported that there are currently over 600 local Communist troops from the Southeast Detachment of the Jianghuai Military Region stationed inside Liuhe City, over 300 stationed in Guabu Town south of Liuhe, and over 700 stationed near Dahekou on the Yangtze River southeast of Liuhe. They have been forcibly requisitioning so-called "firewood" and public grain from the people in recent days. Furthermore, on the Yangzhou front, Nationalist and Communist forces are still facing each other on the line of Sancha River and Shijia Bridge south of the city. There are over 400 local Communist troops stationed in Yangzhou under the command of Communist county magistrate Gu Weiheng.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 4th] There is no fighting on the Yangzhou-Liuhe line. Nationalist and Communist forces remain in a standoff in Shijia Bridge. The ports of Kouan, Sanjiangying, Guazhou, Shierxu, and Yiwei are still in Nationalist hands. Since the resumption of regular Zhenjiang-Guazhou, Zhenjiang-Shierxu, and Zhenjiang-Sizhou ferry services on the 3rd, there have been more people crossing the river to the north than coming south in recent days. The congestion at the riverside has eased slightly compared to before. The defense of Zhenjiang City has been taken over by the Fourth Army under Wang Zuohua. It is also learned that the situation in Nantong is unclear. The telegraph office here has been unable to contact the area.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 4th] Pro-government sources stated on the 4th that the Communist pressure on Nanjing has temporarily eased. Nationalist troops have reoccupied Nantong. Foreign observers believe that the Communist withdrawal from positions threatening Nationalist bridgehead fortresses along the north bank of the Yangtze River is a "major reorganization before an offensive."</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] There was no military activity in the Nanjing area today. Government forces apparently continue to avoid contact with Communist forces. Most Communist activity is of a local nature, as the main force of Chen Yi's troops is resting and reorganizing north of the river. The entire Ministry of National Defense appears to have left Nanjing, with military activity completely in the hands of Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison. It is rumored that Zhou Zhirou and others will also go to South China within days.</p>
<p>Normal Transportation Between the Capital and Liangpu; Driving Order Restored at Xia-Guan Station</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] This morning, a reporter visited Pukou and Puzhen, bridgeheads across the Yangtze River. In addition to soldiers, most of the passengers on the ferries were peddlers, and those who had just crossed north were mostly refugees hurrying to visit their old homes north of the river. Tranquility reigned between the two ports, with passage unimpeded. The only sign of wartime was the soldiers strengthening fortifications. Villagers still lived in their homes in a leisurely manner, enjoying the beautiful spring days. The reporter then returned to Xiaguan and visited the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Station. Traffic order has been restored, and all trains to and from the station arrive and depart on time. The congestion caused by the evacuation before the Lunar New Year, as well as the boxes and baggage that filled the platforms, have disappeared. However, most of the passengers are still single peddlers, carrying and shouldering foreign goods or goods such as lard and chicken eggs. However, they are no longer as extravagant as they were before the New Year, only buying third-class tickets to save costs, so the first and second-class carriages are not as crowded as before. Xiaguan and the city are also smoothly connected by the resumed bus service on the two public bus routes between the southern capital and the city. Therefore, except for a slight decrease in population, the general situation in Nanjing is normal.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Hurry to Suppress Prices!</h3>
<p>Since the reopening of the market after the New Year holiday, prices in Shanghai have been like a wild horse that has thrown off its reins, galloping and jumping wildly, almost impossible to control. Although this round of price increases was led by financial commodities such as gold, US dollars, and silver dollars on the black market, the most violent increases, with the highest multiples, were in daily necessities for the people's livelihood. Especially the price of rice, which has risen too shockingly! Before the Spring Festival, the selling price of rice was only around 1,500 yuan, but by the day before yesterday, the rice market had risen to six levels, with retail prices in the market all above 6,000 yuan. The price of rice rose more than four times in just five or six days, how could the general public and salaried class not turn pale at the news? Whether out of concern for the hardships of the people's livelihood or to ensure local security, the central and municipal authorities cannot stand idly by in the face of the soaring rice prices!</p>
<p>Most shamefully, government officials are only being overwhelmed by the voices of peace, begging to burn, begging for mercy, and relocating, but they have forgotten the major things that should be done quickly right in front of them. Prices are rising so wildly, but the authorities seem to be unmoved. In the past, the central government would often be busy and flustered over the issue of prices, but at present, their hands and feet are not moving for the sake of prices, but are only busy with moving and evacuating, as if the lives of millions of ordinary people are not as important as their own lives. One moment they are clamoring to sell goods, and the next moment they are not selling them. We really don't understand what these meat-eaters are doing!</p>
<p>According to reports, Mayor Wu was quite angered by the soaring rice prices and ordered the rice industry officials to cancel all rice transactions in the northern and southern rice markets and strictly stipulated that the price of white glutinous rice in the market should not exceed 4,500 yuan per dan, and the price of each dou sold at the door should not exceed 480 yuan. At the same time, citizens were restricted from buying rice with their identity cards, limited to five sheng at a time. It is understandable that Mayor Wu took such emergency measures, but whether the measures can be effective is still a serious question. Yesterday, the rice market was still not open, and rice shops were in a state of semi-paralysis. This serious problem of people's food has still not been resolved, making people from all walks of life feel the threat of this "white rice terror."</p>
<p>We analyze the causes of this round of soaring prices from a purely academic point of view, which are nothing more than the following three factors: First, the situation is turbulent and unstable. With the north-south transportation already blocked, the economic zones are inevitably divided. The gold yuan notes in the north fell into the hands of the Communists at once, and through the merchants, they came southward like a landslide, instantly flooding the Shanghai market with hot money. With the capital preparing to move the government to Guangzhou, personnel from various ministries and commissions gathered in Shanghai, preparing to go south, and the hot money in Nanjing also flowed to Shanghai. Guangdong and Hunan provinces have also proposed issuing local currencies, further reducing the credit of the gold yuan in the eyes of the Shanghai people, who have always valued things over currency. Furthermore, considering Shanghai itself, peace? War? No one dares to make a definitive judgment, which makes people even more restless. Reflected in the financial market, it is like adding fuel to the fire, making the price increases unstoppable.</p>
<p>Second, the amount of gold yuan notes issued has increased sharply. At the beginning of the currency system reform implemented in August last year, the whole country, both government and people, hoped that after the currency system reform, there would be no more indiscriminate issuance of currency, and that the gold yuan notes, which were worth 3 million to one, would not become the reformed legal tender after a certain period of time. Therefore, they unanimously advocated strengthening the responsibilities of the Gold Yuan Note Issuance Preparation Committee and publishing the amount of gold yuan notes issued and their preparation on a monthly basis to show great trust. However, after only a few months, the committee became a mere formality and eventually died of 麻痲 (a kind of disease). Up to now, no one knows exactly how many gold yuan notes have been issued. But judging by common sense, the accumulated total amount of gold yuan notes issued at present is considerable. Apart from other things, the large increase in military and government expenses around the Spring Festival alone is quite large. At the same time, the area in which the gold yuan notes circulate is gradually shrinking. Tianjin is no longer circulating, and they are flowing south one after another. Shanghai, which is the first to bear the brunt, has become a refuge for hot money. In this way, how can prices not skyrocket?</p>
<p>Third, the government has not taken any countermeasures against the surging hot money. The authorities had already anticipated that prices would inevitably rise after the Spring Festival, and even declared that on the day the market reopened after the New Year, they would use the method of selling goods to tighten the money supply so that prices would not rise wildly. At first, all industries were apprehensive, and the opening price was not too high. However, by noon, the industries did not see the government take any practical action to sell goods, so prices rose in a frenzy, creating this unprecedented surge.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the first factor, the turbulent and unstable situation, caused this round of soaring prices, which is not something that the authorities can reverse. However, the authorities have a large number of goods, saying they will sell them but not selling them, allowing hot money to flood Shanghai, causing prices to rise several times a day. In the eyes of our people, no matter how the responsible authorities explain it, they are ultimately responsible. We want to tell the authorities that if prices continue to rise, the people will suffer too much and will no longer be able to survive. Unless the government does not want to win back the hearts of the people, it should quickly use all its strength to suppress prices. Otherwise, such a lax and incompetent government, not to mention that it will be greatly affected in preparing for war and defending the Yangtze River, even if it is begging for peace with a shamefaced face, it may not be valued by the other party, and the result will be more than dragging itself down!</p>

<h3>The United States Is Unwilling To Negotiate With The Soviet Union Outside of UN Institutions. Truman Agrees With Acheson's Position. Stalin Would Be Welcomed If He Could Visit Washington.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] President Truman told reporters today that Secretary of State Acheson thoroughly explained the government's attitude yesterday regarding Soviet Premier Stalin's informal invitation to meet behind the Iron Curtain, namely, that the United States is unwilling to discuss matters concerning other countries with the Soviet Union alone.</p>
<p>When asked whether the government would be willing to hold any negotiations with other countries outside of UN institutions, the President bluntly replied "No." However, the President took the opportunity to reiterate that Premier Stalin would be very welcome if he decided to visit Washington. I will ask my wife to prepare the best room in the Blair House (the President's temporary residence while the White House is being renovated) to treat him well. I invited Mr. Stalin to visit Washington during the Potsdam Conference. If Mr. Stalin is still interested in visiting, I will always be ready to learn from him.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] After meeting with President Truman today, US Chief Representative to the United Nations, Austin, told the press that the Soviet Union should prove its desire for peace with actions rather than words. The best measure of this desire is the attitude shown by the Soviet bloc in the Security Council.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] Diplomatic sources said today that the second phase of the Cold War debate between Washington and Moscow will be launched by the Kremlin. The Soviet counterattack may take two paths: first, a renewed attack on the US for rejecting Premier Stalin's peace proposals, accusing it of deliberately wanting war; second, following the path indicated by President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson, proposing to resolve one or more outstanding issues.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 3rd, United Press] Britain has expressed great admiration for the US position against a private meeting between Stalin and Truman. Other Western European countries have also dispelled their fears about US-Soviet talks. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the British government "completely agrees" with US Secretary of State Acheson's opposition to the Stalin-Truman meeting. The policies of London and Washington clearly demonstrate that Britain and the US will continue to work together in the Cold War.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 4th] Soviet newspapers today published President Truman's speech yesterday, all under the headline "Truman Rejects Peace Talks."</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Instructs German Newspaper To Disclose Seven Conditions For Peace Proposal. Berlin Problem Is Key to East-West Struggle.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] US officials on the 4th rejected the Soviet Union's recently instructed seven-point "peace plan" and frankly declared that the conflict will continue until the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade. The recent peace proposal was put forward by a Soviet-controlled Berlin newspaper, which listed what it considered to be the seven most important conditions for resolving East-West disputes.</p>
<p>The seven conditions are: (1) withdrawal of US troops stationed in Greece; (2) withdrawal of US troops stationed in South Korea; (3) acceptance of the Soviet disarmament plan; (4) abandonment of the North Atlantic Security Treaty; (5) postponement of the plan to establish West Germany; (6) changing Western countries' policies in Berlin; (7) changing Western countries' plans for the Ruhr. US diplomats called these proposals "absurd and foolish," pointing out that the Soviet Union has "no intention of taking any action." Officials said the key to the entire East-West struggle lies in Berlin. Unless the Soviet Union abandons its attempt to force the US, Britain, and France out of Berlin by force, sincere negotiations to resolve all problems cannot begin. Because the Soviet Union is relying on its Berlin blockade to attempt to break through the current Western defenses, control all of Germany, and effectively control all of Western Europe. Officials also declared that under no circumstances will Western countries abandon Berlin.</p>

<h3>Rice Store Closure Enrages Mayor, Orders Reopening Today For Supply. Four Measures Agreed Upon To Maintain Order.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] To suppress the rice price, Mayor Wu announced an emergency measure the day before yesterday allowing citizens to purchase rice with purchase permits. However, to his surprise, all rice stores in the city closed yesterday, refusing to sell rice, and it was reported that black market rice was selling for as high as 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Upon hearing this, Mayor Wu was extremely angry. He specially summoned rice merchant representatives such as Qu Zhenhua to the VIP room of the City Hall for a discussion at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. Reporters heard Mayor Wu's thunderous voice from outside the door. The rice merchant representatives explained that the reason for the closure was fear of citizens搶購 (qiang gou, rush-buying/panic-buying). If the authorities did not have proper measures to protect them, accidents would be unavoidable. Therefore, they requested that the city government send police to maintain order, and all rice stores would immediately supply rice for sale. Mayor Wu approved the above request. Four supplementary measures were agreed upon yesterday: (1) District-based rice purchase: citizens must purchase rice from rice stores in their own district. (2) Rush-buying is prohibited. (3) Anyone who disturbs the order will be immediately arrested and sent to the Garrison Headquarters for military trial. (4) Citizens must present their own citizen ID when purchasing rice, and they are only allowed to purchase on behalf of their own family members.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu told reporters when he met with them yesterday afternoon that the use of the No. 5 purchase permit will have to wait for another day or two, because the rice allocated by the Food Department has not yet arrived. Wu also ordered all rice stores in the city to open for business today. If there is any [unclear] matter, the city government will order the police bureau to send personnel to sell on their behalf. All proceeds will be used as a special self-defense donation.</p>

<p>The tuition standard proposed by the principals of municipal middle schools is 1.5 shi for senior high schools and 1.2 shi for junior high schools, including the teachers' advanced training fund.

<h3>One Wave Subsides, Another Rises: Plainclothes Soldiers Assault Ticket Sellers; French Tram Company Suspends Operations Again</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The French Tram Company had suspended operations once the day before yesterday due to protests over soldiers assaulting company employees. After persuasion by the authorities, service had just returned to normal yesterday morning.

A plainclothes soldier boarded, and the ticket seller on the tram, No. 911, asked him to purchase a ticket. A verbal dispute arose, and the plainclothes soldier, identifying himself as Wang Yongsheng, a member of the Subei Mobile Corps, immediately pulled out a pistol and used the handle to strike the ticket seller, No. 911, on the left arm. The driver saw the commotion in the tram and immediately stopped the vehicle. Subsequently, trams on various lines also gradually stopped, causing traffic congestion. Drivers and ticket sellers rushed over to inquire, and upon learning that another incident involving soldiers using violence had occurred, they were outraged and insisted that the security authorities fulfill their promises by punishing the offending soldiers on the spot.

Therefore, after 6:00 PM, no trams could be seen on Linsen Middle Road, and pedicab drivers took the opportunity to raise prices, causing residents of the western district to complain incessantly.</p>

<h3>Pedicab Driver Robbed; Police and Robber Scuffle; Bullets Wound Two People</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Near the Gongwu Restaurant on Zhongzheng Middle Road, at around 9:00 PM last night, a pedicab driver named Zhu Zhoufu (39 years old, from Jiangbei) was carrying a passenger in a black woolen suit towards the Carlton Theater. Before long, the passenger suddenly ordered Zhu to go to Yuanmingyuan Road, then to a lane on Jinling Road near Xikou Road, and asked him to stop, saying that he would go inside to get the fare. Zhu followed behind him, and upon reaching a certain number, the passenger pulled out a pistol and threatened Zhu. As a result, a gold ring from Zhu's hand and 800 yuan in gold yuan were robbed. Zhu shouted for help, and the robber fled to the entrance of the Jimei Hotel on Xikou Road. Officers No. 4000 and No. 3758 from the Huangpu Precinct happened to hear the alarm and arrived. The robber, to gain the upper hand, immediately opened fire to resist arrest. The two officers also drew their guns and returned fire. The two sides fought, exchanging more than ten shots. When the robber fired, he fell to the ground at one point. Seeing this, the two officers rushed forward, intending to capture him alive, but unfortunately, there were too many pedestrians there, and the robber was able to escape into the crowd. Afterwards, it was discovered that two people, a man and a woman, had been wounded by stray bullets. They were taken to Renji Hospital by police car for treatment. It is reported that the man, Chen Zhongfan, 30 years old, from Nanjing, residing at No. 43 Houjiabang Road in the city, sustained a graze wound to his right foot. The woman was a young woman from Jiangbei named Zhang Baoshi (25 years old, who had just arrived in Shanghai from her hometown and was temporarily staying with relatives at the Xinminghua Barber Shop on Glan Road in Dapu). She was shot in the lower right abdomen, with the bullet entering from the front and exiting from the back, and her life is in critical condition. The two officers apprehended a suspect at the scene and took him to the station for questioning. He identified himself as Chen Xianfu, 21 years old, a Chinese medicine doctor. The precinct is currently dispatching officers to search for the fugitive.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Basketball League: Hualian vs. McLain's</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Air Force School Team Withdraws from League</p>
<p>The Fourth Basketball League continues tonight with two Group A matches and one women's match at the Municipal Gymnasium. The main match is Hualian vs. McLain's. There has been a slight change in the schedule. The Hangzhou Air Force Officer School basketball team recently sent a letter to the Basketball Committee stating that due to recent academic busyness and transportation inconvenience, they will be unable to attend and regrettably withdraw from the league. The Basketball Association immediately convened a committee to resolve the issue. A week ago, the US Navy's Pfeiffer requested to join, and it was decided that the US Navy would fill the Officer School's vacancy. In today's three matches, Pfeiffer will play in the Officer School vs. Renyu match. Ticket prices have been adjusted to 50 yuan upstairs, 100 yuan downstairs, and 200 yuan for reserved seats in the arena. Lu Zijun of Siwei will maintain order. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>Morning Friends Cup Decisive Re-Match: Huili Defeated by Three Points; Morning Friends Wins First Game</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The decisive rematch for the Group A championship of the Morning Friends Cup basketball tournament, between Huili and Morning Friends (best of three), was held at the Municipal Gymnasium at 7:30 PM last night. Huili lost by three points, with a final score of 65-62. Morning Friends led throughout the game, with a score of 37-21 in the first half. Huili lost too many points in the first half, and although they tried very hard in the second half, they were unable to surpass them. Looking at the performance in the last five minutes, Huili had a chance to come back, but they were ultimately unable to salvage the situation, much to the regret of the audience. The gymnasium was quite lively last night, with over 5,000 spectators. Wang Yongfang and Zeng Yongji were the most active for Huili yesterday, but the whole team seemed flustered and out of sorts. They had many opportunities to shoot, but they lacked accuracy. In particular, they only made twelve out of thirty free throws. Morning Friends' fast passing and pure cooperation were beyond Huili's reach. Morning Friends also took the initiative under the basket. Huili relied on long-range shots to score. In the first half, they once narrowed the gap to 10-9, but unfortunately, they could not surpass them at that time, and they remained behind for the rest of the game. Morning Friends won the first game, so let's see the second game.</p>

<h3>Scholarship Donations Set New Record; Anonymous Donor Generously Donates 100,000; Hoping Readers Will Continue Their Efforts</h3>
<p>Since January 18th, we have made numerous appeals in the newspaper, hoping that enthusiastic readers will actively donate scholarships to encourage and support students. After the Lunar New Year, for many days in a row, we did not receive any significant donations. Seeing that the winter vacation was about to end, and countless students were still eagerly waiting, we could no longer bear to think about it! Yesterday, we received a generous donation of 100,000 yuan from an anonymous donor, 5,000 yuan from a donor who did not want to be named, 3,000 yuan from colleagues at the Bank of China, and 2,020 yuan from Mr. Zhang. These donations have greatly advanced our fundraising efforts, and the future of countless poor young people has begun to show a glimmer of dawn. Finally, we hope that readers from all walks of life can give us even stronger support and encouragement.</p>

<h3>Board Meeting to be Held Tomorrow, Stock Exchange Reopening Not Far Off, Personnel Issues to be Decided at the Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to reliable sources, the reopening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which has been in preparation for a long time, will be imminent within one or two days. The responsible officials of the Ministries of Finance and Industry have verbally notified the stock exchange authorities that the eleven articles of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Reopening Measures, passed at the 41st meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 26th of last month, have been formally sent to the exchange and are expected to arrive today. If the reopening measures arrive as scheduled, the exchange will convene a standing board meeting tomorrow to complete all necessary preparations for reopening in accordance with the provisions of the reopening measures and to determine the reopening date. At the same time, a final decision will be made on the personnel issues of the exchange.</p>
<p>After the exchange reopens, the securities to be listed, according to regulations, are: (1) government bonds, (2) state-owned enterprise stocks, and (3) private company stocks. In addition to the listing of the first two types of securities, which will be determined by separate orders from the Ministries of Finance and Industry, the 31 types of private company stocks that were originally listed, although many have not been approved for registration changes, the new regulations consider the listing and trading of these stocks as a preliminary agreement for transfer. Therefore, after the stock exchange reopens, they can immediately continue to be listed and traded. However, according to regulations, these stocks must still complete the registration change procedures within three months from the date of the exchange's reopening.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that with regard to the personnel issues of the exchange, in addition to the resignation of the original General Manager Wang Zhixin being approved, the resignation of the original Chief Secretary Hua Wenyu has also been approved by Wang Zhixin. The original Assistant Manager Yang Yinpu has requested to resign from the board of directors, but has not been approved and is still firmly resigning. The newly appointed General Manager Gu Shanchang has not yet taken office and is waiting for a final decision at the standing board meeting tomorrow. As for the employees of the exchange, in addition to one-third who have already accepted severance pay, there are still more than 100 people remaining. It is said that after the reopening, the exchange will temporarily maintain austerity and will not add new personnel.</p>
<h3>Overseas Remittance Exchange Rate Abolished</h3>
<p>The overseas remittance exchange rate has been officially abolished by the Central Bank yesterday. Starting from the 5th, overseas Chinese remittances will be converted into Gold Yuan at the market price of transfer certificates. Regarding the abolition of the overseas remittance exchange rate, the Central Bank authorities stated that the reason for the abolition is that the overseas remittance exchange rate is lower than the price of foreign exchange certificates, which has already lost its significance, and is therefore abolished.</p>
<p>The price of foreign exchange transfer certificates rose again on the 4th, opening at 600 yuan in the morning. Trading became more active, and the price closed as high as 700 yuan at noon, an increase of 200 yuan compared to the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Inflow of Funds from Other Cities Continues, Easing of Credit Continues</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the easing of credit in Shanghai continued. The Central Bank still sold few materials, and because prices have risen too sharply in recent days, buyers were generally cautious, and demand was scarce. The overnight interest rate hovered between 30 and 35 yuan. Banks and firms had more funds than they could use, and they actively reduced the interest rates for their customers, so the market turnover was very fluid. Furthermore, it is reported that cash funds are still abundant, and most of the circulating currency is in 50 yuan denominations, while 100 yuan denominations are still being sought after. It is said that the discount rate has slightly increased, only to 101 yuan per 100.</p>
<p>According to financial figures, the amount of funds arriving in Shanghai from other cities, either in the form of drafts or cash, has reached 3 to 4 billion yuan per day in recent days. The reason why the Central Bank's exchanges have shown a deficit since the Lunar New Year lies in this. Furthermore, it is reported that the total amount of deposits in the banking industry yesterday was estimated to be around 5 billion yuan. Although the amount has increased compared to the past, it is actually less than before compared to prices.</p>
<h3>Ban on Export of Edible Oil, Temporarily for One Month</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The matter of temporarily suspending the export of edible oil and its raw materials from Shanghai has already been announced by the Jianghai Customs on the 2nd. The Customs yesterday issued a supplementary announcement that the temporary suspension of exports will be effective for one month from February 2 of this year.</p>
<h3>Silver Shops Request Reopening, Methods Being Negotiated</h3>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance, the petition from silver shops requesting to reopen has been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance by the Bureau of Gold Control. The Ministry is currently working with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to formulate more specific measures. Once these measures are submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, they will be announced and implemented. There are no problems with the issuance of short-term gold bonds. The issuance is currently awaiting the establishment of the Fund Management Committee. Once the committee announces its establishment, the issuance can be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Costs Higher Than Price Ceiling, Rice Market Trading Stalled, Authorities Threw Rice at Price Ceiling Yesterday at 5,000 Right</h3>
<p>Rice market trading did not open in either the North or South markets yesterday. Because the authorities set a price ceiling of no more than 4,500 yuan per stone (150 catties) including commission, but merchants had high production costs and rising commodity prices, costs were higher than the price ceiling, so no one sold, and the North and South markets did not open. The market has come to a standstill, and market quotations have also stopped. The authorities threw 2,500 stones of rice in each of the North and South markets near the close of the market yesterday, throwing a total of 5,000 stones at the price ceiling, but because the procedures were not completed, the rice was not immediately distributed to rice shops.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The rising trend has not stopped. Lao Che (old brand) is shouting a price breaking the 3,000 yuan mark. Someone responsible in the market strongly urged colleagues not to raise the price so high. After the initial market rose to 2,750 yuan, no transactions were seen. Bing Chuan (military ship) rose sharply by 600 yuan and also opened at 2,750 yuan at the close. There were not many Red Bee transactions. Jiancheng (built city) did not open, and the prices of all other brands of flour rose sharply by about 30%. The rising trend of wheat bran continued. Fuxin Big Bag once broke the 2,000 yuan mark, and at the close, it slightly pulled back to 1,930 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Ben Gang Zhu Yi, as oil prices soared, oil factories have been sparing no effort to take in raw peanuts. People's hearts are firm and expensive, and the market has risen sharply. The prices of all goods have generally increased by more than 70%, all exceeding the 10,000 yuan mark. Yellow beans are extremely scarce. The grain merchants are pushing the price up. Zha beans have risen by another 20%. Corn was weak at first and then firm, rising slightly by 200 yuan compared to the previous day. Sesame merchants are holding on and not letting go. There were no transactions. Red sorghum and mung beans rose sharply, and picked Qing (grade) is urgently approaching the 5,000 mark.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The rising trend in yesterday's market slowed slightly, but still saw a slight increase in the end. The market opened very late, and prices were very tight. The market turned weak at the close because external prices were flat. Soybean oil was first traded at 33,000, and closed at 31,000, rising by 2,000 yuan. Jitong raw oil was 38,000 yuan, and pure raw oil was also 38,000 yuan, rising by 4,000 yuan. Raw vegetable oil was 26,000, rising by 2,000. Qing oil and cooked vegetable oil were firm at first and then flat, similar to yesterday. Soybean cakes rose by 400-500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Continues to Rise Sharply, Cloth Market Turns Weak from Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market continued to rise sharply yesterday. At the initial opening, the US Aid Council was still going to list and sell, and people were slightly worried. The market was still flat at the opening. Later, no sales were seen, and the price was pushed up again. Fine yarn rose by another 30,000 yuan, and coarse yarn also rose by 25,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The 42-count Blue Phoenix opened in the morning initially shouted 330,000 to sell. After the shouting, the trend was weak. Local street merchants watched and did not move forward. Merchants felt weak and frequently sold. The market turned weak and the asking price dropped to 270,000-280,000 yuan. After the low price, actual sales moved again, and the market improved. The market rebounded and closed at 320,000 at noon, rising 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The 21-count Shuangma (Double Horse) opened in the morning and sold for 200,000 yuan. People seemed to be still flat and weak, and the price fell back by 10,000 yuan. Later, because the yarn sellers did not come to the market, confidence grew slightly, and the market rebounded. The asking price rose to 220,000 yuan. After the high price, there were many floats and sales, and the market was slightly flat. At noon, it ended at 200,000 yuan, rising 25,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth continued to rise yesterday. The market was firm at first and then showed a slight weakness. Guangbang (Guangdong merchants) were hesitant because the Customs was about to implement a ban on the transport of cotton cloth to the south. Colleagues showed hesitancy, and there was a lot of selling on account. Retail investors felt that the asking price was already high, and the buying mood faded. Therefore, the market slightly weakened at the close.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Biji opened at 6,800 yuan. After opening, it continued to rise all the way. At around 10 o'clock, it once rose to 7,900 yuan. Later, it instantly fell back to around 7,400 yuan, hovering for a long time, and finally closed at 7,100 yuan at noon, rising another 600 yuan from the previous day. Jinlian Miaowu Biji fell from 7,500 yuan to 7,200 yuan. Tiaoli Yuanhui Guangliao closed at 4,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth once exceeded the 8,000 yuan mark, then retreated to 7,500 yuan. Longtou B fine cloth also fluctuated dramatically, rising from 6,400 yuan to 7,100 yuan, and finally closed at 6,600 yuan, rising by 1,100 yuan. Mid-range fine cloths such as Laba Tong, Wufu B Da Shuanglong, etc., all exceeded the 6,000 yuan mark, and transactions were still frequent.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Rises</p>
<p>The Tung oil market opened sharply in the morning yesterday, and the rising trend was as fierce as a wild horse off the leash. The reason was that the positions of colleagues were flooded, and the settlement transfer certificates continued to be active. People's hearts were strongly supported, and there was a continuous stream of buying in the market. The market developed rapidly, and transactions were also very exciting.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's version, after the "Foreign Late Certificate Rises Sharply" item, the text from the fifth paragraph onwards in the front-page "Foreign Reporters Look at China" news was mistakenly included, resulting in inconsistencies. We urgently correct this.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Transport to the South, Minister of Industry and Commerce Believes Strict Restrictions Are Inappropriate</h3>
<p>Private yarn mills have opposed the restriction on the transport of yarn and cloth to the south. The authorities believe that this measure has many drawbacks and are carefully considering it, and it is unlikely to be implemented in the short term. Yesterday, the reporter asked Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weizhi about this matter. According to him, the purpose of economic measures should be to take into account the common and consistent interests of the whole country. It is not appropriate to make plans for one time and one place. Any division will cause damage to the economic interests of the whole country. The lessons of the past are not far away, and there is no need to repeat them. Therefore, in theory, the transport of yarn and cloth to the south should not only be permitted, but also encouraged to be sold throughout the country. Furthermore, the transport of yarn and cloth to the south has always been a major source of national foreign exchange income, and the clothing needs of the people in the southern provinces have always relied on Shanghai for supply. Moreover, the motive for the current transport of yarn and cloth to the south is mostly to preserve the safety of assets. At a time when the situation is turbulent, this is also understandable. Therefore, I believe that the transport of yarn and cloth to the south should not be restricted unconditionally under the current circumstances, but should be opened up as much as possible within the scope that does not affect the needs of the city, in order to facilitate economic exchanges and promote prosperity. This is also what the textile industry in the city urgently hopes to maintain its survival. It is reported that the textile industry in the city again sent many representatives to see Liu the night before last, urging him to open up exports. Liu expressed his willingness to sincerely consider the difficulties of the textile industry.</p>

<h3>After the Spring Festival in Hangzhou, the "City of Culture" Proposal is Undergoing Lively Discussion</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Report, 3rd] After the Spring Festival, due to the evacuation of various agencies from the capital, Hangzhou - a quiet area in Jiangnan - has also become bustling. The continuous passage and stationing of troops, with insufficient campgrounds, requisitioning of civilian houses, and the residences in the city station area have been requisitioned to varying degrees. People accustomed to comfortable houses in the Hubin area have no choice but to let their houses be inhabited by unfamiliar soldiers.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou train</p>
<p>is absolutely not on time. A friend who came from Shanghai happily said to the reporter: "I am very lucky, I finally walked for ten hours." One day, the station staff at the Shanghai-Hangzhou stations all hid, the reason for what? The reporter is not allowed to elaborate. What else can be said when the traffic is like this? Therefore, it is the fastest thing for Shanghai newspapers to come to Hangzhou every other day, otherwise it will take at least two days, how can people not be panicked?</p>
<p>The people of the paradise, known for their tranquility and ease, can't help but feel a little heavy when facing the reality in front of them. The most obvious is the fluctuation of prices. The black market price of gold ornaments is more than 50,000 Gold Yuan, and Yuan Datou (silver dollars) also costs more than 1,000 yuan. Rice has broken through the three-thousand mark, and cigarettes have tripled in price. Everything else is soaring, more than three or four times. In view of the chaos and the price increases, the shops have no choice but to take advantage of this Lunar New Year to rest for a few more days. Today should be the sixth day of the Lunar New Year, two days after "receiving the God of Wealth", but many shops have no intention of opening, and the market feels a sense of depression.</p>
<p>Small cars</p>
<p>have suddenly increased, and the most beautiful are the streamlined ones. Trucks and jeeps have all increased. Traffic police have to look at cars with "〇〇" numbers differently, because the owners often compare the capital to Hangzhou, and are not familiar with the traffic rules of Hangzhou. No matter what a one-way street is, they have to walk if they want to, rushing and hitting, it's simply outrageous.</p>
<p>Large hotels</p>
<p>are full of big spenders with a "capital" atmosphere. There are many who spend ten thousand gold at a time. Although they are evacuated, they are much wider than the people who live in Hangzhou. However, there are also some people, those who are evacuated by order, who are quite pitiful. They wander the streets, and they have to hesitate to buy a big cake. They carry their wives, children, and old people with them, and the future is vast. They don't know when it will end. Therefore, as long as the weather does not rain, the streets are always crowded with people. Although they are strolling around, their moods are tight, and they are uneasy all day long. The places where they live are extremely crowded, the things they eat are extremely simple, and when they are free, they have nothing to do except stroll around the streets. Fatigue and boredom fill everyone's faces.</p>
<p>Restaurants</p>
<p>also have their luck and misfortune. Some receive good customers, who spend tens of millions of gold at a time. Some receive poor friends, and some don't have a penny. However, those near transportation facilities often receive the latter, while those near scenic spots often receive the former. The shops that receive the latter complain a lot, and the shops that receive the former smile.</p>
<p>With the influx of passers-by in Hangzhou, sanitation has also become a very serious problem. Urinating everywhere and the stench are already commonplace.</p>
<p>In a panic-stricken situation, there is actually a group of</p>
<p>scholars</p>
<p>discussing building Hangzhou into a cultural capital. That was the topic raised at the sixth literary and art evening party of the Hangzhou office of this newspaper. Professors, artists, cultural figures, and news reporters from various universities unanimously requested that Hangzhou be built into a cultural city. Although it is now a time of war and chaos, for the sake of Hangzhou's century-long plan and for the future fate of Hangzhou, they all have the same view and the same request.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Council, in order to cooperate with their proposed "undefended city", also proposed building Hangzhou into a cultural city. At their review meeting, they invited Professor Zhang Qi, who advocated building Hangzhou, and the reporter to give speeches. After we analyzed Hangzhou's natural environment, historical traditions, and future trends, they decided that Hangzhou's construction should focus on culture in the future.</p>
<p>Cooperating with this construction of Hangzhou as a</p>
<p>City of Culture</p>
<p>a lot of theater troupes are performing dramas in Hangzhou. Recently, the Chinese Drama Sar Society performed "The Government Inspector," followed by the Youth Military Drama Art Society's "Chai Tou Feng," followed by the drama exhibition of various theater troupes at the Drama Festival, followed by the Chunqiu Travel Drama Troupe's "Shen Yuan," and so on and so forth... Cultural activities are increasing. We need the cooperation of various different categories of cultural activities. No matter when the ideal of a "City of Culture" is realized, but since we have determined the direction, we should constantly work towards this direction.</p>
<h3>Jinan No. 1 Joint Middle School Opens Classes in Chang'an</h3>
<p>[Our Chang'an Town Report, 3rd] Chang'an Town National Jinan No. 1 Joint Middle School, accommodating more than 2,000 Shandong refugee students, lives in the Lian Yuan Silk Factory and Chang'an Silk Factory in the town. Among these refugee students, there are many children who are only thirteen or fourteen years old. They are thinly clothed and have suffered the bitterness of wandering. Fortunately, the government and local authorities have provided assistance in various ways, so that they are spared the worry of freezing and starvation. During the Lunar New Year, the Chang'an Silk Factory also donated three stones of white rice to allow the students to have a good meal. Previously, the silk factory donated 2,500 pairs of socks to the students, which proves that the students and local people have a very harmonious relationship. At present, the school is actively preparing for classes, and more than 100 faculty members have been hired. It has also stored food for one month, and classes will officially begin in early February.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Arrests Silver Dollar Dealers, The Clanging Sound in the Downtown Area Disappears</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Report, 4th] The local authorities have long banned silver dollar dealers, but the enforcement has been inconsistent. Before and after the Spring Festival, there were more "professionals" in the Zhenjiang market. Even teachers temporarily engaged in this career. The downtown area was full of clanging sounds. On the second day of the New Year, Yuan Datou rose to 980 yuan. It fell on the fourth day, and yesterday (February 2) it rose again to 1,150. Although the red disk of various industries has not opened, the black market is based on the rising of Yuan Datou. The public security authorities started arresting "silver dollar dealers" again on the 3rd. In the afternoon, the clanging sounds of silver dollars that filled the streets and downtown areas have disappeared.</p>
<h3>Pocket News</h3>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>[Our Report] Zhu Wenan, a returning township councilor (formerly the township head), and Chen Amai, his wife's younger brother, were suddenly shot and killed by thugs on the night of January 31. Because assassination cases have been repeatedly seen in the southern townships, the county council has strictly limited the solving of the case. The local prosecutor's office has sent personnel to the countryside to examine the body to help arrest the murderer and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>[Our Report] For the sake of strengthening defense, the Joint Defense Headquarters of Su, Kun, and Wu counties will start to set up a direct telephone line between the three counties from today.</p>
<p>Jurong</p>
<p>[Our Report] The transportation vehicles on all roads in this county: (1) The vehicles of the Provincial Highway Bureau have stopped running on the Zhen (Jiang) Ju (Rong) line. (2) The Jiangnan Automobile Company has declared closure due to excessive losses. (3) The Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has moved, which has caused the entire external transportation of Jurong to fall into a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, as the war has approached the Yangtze River, the trend of fleeing has become more intense, especially among important people traveling to Wuxi. The large and small cars on the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) National Highway are full of travelers, fleeing to Shanghai one after another, causing people to panic. Ma Xiyuan, the president of the Wuxi Local Court, left Wuxi quietly on the Lunar New Year's Eve, carrying valuable luggage in his own car, to go to Shanghai and then to Guangzhou. Officials are free to evacuate, making him the first person in Xishan to do so. It is learned that Ma's trip is purely to visit his beloved wife and there is no other reason. If the situation improves, he will return to his post.</p>
<p>Fengxian</p>
<p>[Our Report] This county has been ordered to rush to repair the Nantai Highway connecting to the Pudong Avenue, which is limited to be completed before the 10th of this month. The four townships of Nanqiao, etc., started mobilization and construction on the 2nd. The entire road is 15 kilometers long, with 7 bridges, all limited to a load of 7 tons or more. County Mayor Chen Xuan will go to Qixian Town on the morning of the 3rd to convene local villagers and the public to give propaganda and instructions to urge the timely completion of the roadbed and bridges to facilitate traffic.</p>
<p>Pinghu</p>
<p>[Our Report] Shen Yueshu, a partner in the Jusheng Oil Hotel outside the East Gate of the city, gambled with others during the Lunar New Year and lost a total of 25 stones of unmilled rice. After paying all the cash, he still owed about 10 stones. He first asked the manager, Hu Peiqing, for a loan, but was unsuccessful. He was then pressed by creditors such as Jin, and was overwhelmed with shame and resentment. He committed suicide with a rifle at around 12 o'clock on the night of the 1st. The bullet entered from the lower jaw and exited from the back of the head. Chen Shilin, the duty squad leader of the Hantang Town Office outside the West Gate, also committed suicide with a rifle by pulling the trigger with his foot at around 12 o'clock on the night of the 1st due to economic pressure.</p>
