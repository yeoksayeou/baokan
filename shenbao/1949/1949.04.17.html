<h3>中共提出兩項要求　組聯合機構與渡江　盼政府於二十日前答復</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕據悉：中共巳向政府表明類似北平式和平之要求，並盼政府於廿日前提出答覆。此項消息，係極具權威之某人士十六日晚所透露。據云：黃紹竑返京後，北平和談進行情形，及癥結所在，巳全部明瞭。中共所提要求，包括政治方面為即日組成聯合機構，以替代現政府。軍事方面，則為即日實現渡江，進行改編軍隊。政府對此項要求，巳感相當困擾，現正研擬對策。該人士稱：和談目前之主要癥結，厥為渡江問題，此在政府方面，實難輕予同意。政府方面所提「劃江分治」原則，目的為就地停戰，立即以普選方式，聽從人民公意，組成聯合政府，然後進行軍隊之整編，藉以避免改編軍隊前可能引起之一切不必要糾紛。如共方堅持渡江之要求，不論其為何種方式，政府均無法接受，和談前途之成敗，尚以此為重大關鍵。萬一此項問題不能順利解決，政府可能將和談經過詳情公布，以訴諸人民之公斷。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十六日廣播：香港訊：左傾報紙「遠東公報」，預料共軍大規模的渡江攻勢，將「兩星期內」開始，并謂其結果將無可逃避。</p>
<h3>黃紹竑昨返京報告　當局集議研討對策</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕和談正式會議開始後，中共即就八項條件之原則，提出細目廿四條款，作為實施八項條件之具體方案，其中包括整軍步驟，及聯合政府之組織等項。該方案曾經雙方代表團會商，並已由資紹竑於十六日携返京，政府即將就此方案予以研究，並提出對策，於兩三日內，再由黃氏携平，提出於會中討論，以期獲致協議。又和談正式會議，於十三日及十五日夜晚，分別舉行第一二兩次會議，即就該方案進行討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕李代總統十六日下午八時，在傅厚崗官邸，召集何應欽，張羣，白崇禧等，舉行會議，由黃紹竑報告北平和談情形，並加以研討。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕何應欽十六日曾在政務會議中，就和談問題，提出報告稱：和談業已在平展開，並正就中共所提出之方案，作縝密之研討。政府代表黃紹竑，原定十三日返京，而稽遲至今之因素，即在於俟該方案討論告一段落返京報告。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕政府和談代表黃紹竑及顧問屈武，巳於十六日下午二時半，自平乘專機抵京。抵機場相迎者，有代總統代表劉士毅，何應欽院長，及立院秘長陳克文，政委張羣等數十人。專機即係於十三日載送劉仲容·朱蘊山返平之央航XT五一五號機，十六日晨十時三刻自平起飛者。黃氏下機後，首先遭遇記者羣之包圍，但黃氏在輪番疲勞之詢問中，對和談之內容，仍未有一字之透露，及正面之答覆，僅連稱今天天氣很好，並附以不可推測之笑聲，此種包圍，達十餘分鐘之久，但竟在「天氣好」一語之外，無所收穫，旋黃氏衝出包圍圈後，即與往迎之政府官員握手寒暄，並於極短時間內，與屈武同車離去，又據記者所見，黃之西服口袋內，曾有重要函件露置袋口，黃氏當被包圍擁擠之中時，時以手相探，似極珍貴。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央航空公司第五一五號專機，接載政府和談代表黃紹竑返京，於昨晨十時五十分自平起飛，下午二時廿五分抵京，三時四十五分飛滬，五時十分抵龍華機場，載來郵件一批。該公司所派載送于右任飛平之第五三一號專機，昨仍停留於龍華，可能於明日飛京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕確息：第三方面人士張瀾·羅隆基等，有於最近期內赴平之可能，中共曾有意邀彼等前往共同襄助和談之進行，並巳由有關人士轉達意見中。又聞被邀人士大部在滬，除張·羅兩氏外，楊衛玉·冷遹·史良·葉篤義等，均在被邀之列。</p>
<h3>中共高唱城市政策　目前溫和手段乃適應現實　新民主主義並非終極目的</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕某權威人士十六日接見本報記者時，曾暢談中共當前政策，及毛澤東，周恩來之政見，茲擇其要者，略誌一二如次：中共當前政策，在其高唱城市政策之際，對於過去鬥爭手段，略有改善，尤以最近完成和平之北平城為最。平市民之生活，目前仍平靜一如往昔，但據周恩來表示，中共乃一革命政黨，不能中途止其革命，更不能隨意妥協，故目前溫和政策，實為適應現實環境，並深覺有以政治方式代替軍事方式之必要，以避免流血鬥爭。北平倡行之新民主主義經濟政策，實接近於三民主義之民主主義，所不同者，在於中共並非以新民主主義為其終極目的。反之，乃以新民主主義為其橋樑。某氏旋稱：當前中共能與政府進行和平商談，實即中共白鬥爭手段進而以政治方式達到革命目的之轉變實例。毛澤東曾談及土地改革問題，認為待研究之處甚多，辦理亦極困難。毛氏並特別指出江南之土地改革，至少在五年以後方可做到，而在此五年之內，如能做到減租減息，巳可告滿意。某氏並稱：外傳此次政府代表團在平，中共招待有傲慢之處，其實不然，除政府代表團到達時，毛·周等未往迎接外，招待亦極周到，在情感上說，凡熟朋友不分國共，仍講交情，但如為問題而爭執，則面紅耳赤，在所不措。</p>
<h3>代表團在平　生活忙碌辛勞</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕據悉：政府代表團一日抵平後，係下榻六國飯店，當晚中共代表團設宴招待，宴後舉行預備會議，商定和談進行方式，為先個別接見，廣泛交換意見，然後舉行正式會議，同時決定所有和談新聞雙方均不公布。二日起，開始個別接觸，前後達十一天之久。十三日晚八時，始開第一次正式會議。十四日雙方分別研討。十五日晚舉行第二次會議。政府代表團在平之活動，大致為上午與第三方面人士接觸，午後內部舉行會議，交換意見，晚間與中共代表談話或開會，極為忙碌辛勞。每晚由勤政殿歸來時，必在午夜以後，北平雖春光明媚，景物如畫，政府代表亦無暇往遊。中共招待甚週到，所有用費，均由中共方面負担。政府代表原携有銀幣三箱，擬自行發付一切用費，嗣以中共招待，故動用甚少。</p>
<h3>傅秉常離英返國</h3>
<p>行前與貝文晤談廿分鍾</p>
<p>〔路透社南安普登十六日電〕傅秉常今日搭英國海外航空公司飛船離此赴香港轉返本國，傅氏臨行又聲明，返國將先實地視察國內情形，再決定擔任外長與否，在此為傅氏送行者，有中國駐英法荷捷等國大使。</p>

<h3>政務會議通過要案　郵電鐵路今加價　郵電連底十五倍鐵路連底十倍</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕十六日政務會通過郵電鐵路加價，並決定十七日起實行，計郵電加價連底十五倍，平信由一百圓加至一千五百圓，尋常電每字二百元加至三千圓。鐵路連底十倍，客運每公里由四十圓增為四百圓，貨運每噸每里由六十五圓增為六百五十圓。在此次調整新價後，郵電鐵路事業機構之經費，可自負百分之七十五，政府補貼可因而減少，同時交通當局擬循此漸進達成自給自足之目的，惟四川·貴州兩省因物價較低，郵電費決減收百分之廿。此外，會中曾討論南北通匯及南北通航（航空）問題，決分交國防·交通·財政部研究。（新價數字見第四版）</p>

<h3>對和談前途的看法</h3>
<p>— 錢納水</p>
<p>一個二十幾年戰亂未息的國家，又遭遇八年多的外敵蹂躪，社會元氣凋喪極矣。全國人民滿望抗戰勝利將帶來和平幸福；而事與願違，接着竟是將近四年的新戰亂，烽火燒逼長江以北的半個中國。戰區人民固飽受砲火之災，破家喪生，慘不忍觀，而非戰區人民亦因供應頻繁，痛苦不堪，於是人同此心，心同此理，更莫不熱望戰事之立即結束，和平之立即實現。兩年前，我個人亦曾以最大熱情與信心，參加和平運動，但奔走呼號之聲，終為砲火的怒吼所制壓，這一運動遂以夭殤。目前新的和談正在進行，基於全國人民望治心切，這和談是應該有前途的，基於雙方各有其繼續作戰的困難，這和談也是應該有前途的。</p>
<p>國民政府繼續作戰的困難，無論軍事上，政治上，經濟上，都表現得很清楚，用不着一一指出來。共產黨方面呢？依我看來，軍事，政治，經濟的困難，實也不小。</p>
<p>共產黨的軍事困難何在？</p>
<p>先從渡江問題看。在徐蚌會戰結束後，南京曾一度陷於極度慌亂狀態，這是共產黨軍事渡江的最好機會。但當時共產黨雖打了大勝仗，却也遭受了大消耗，不經過一時期的整理補充，而即進行渡江之戰，是過於冒險的。幾個月的時間，使共軍從容調遣，佈置了渡江攻勢，也使政府軍加緊調遣佈置了扼江而守的防禦，於是形成目前軍事上的相持之局。</p>
<p>長江古有天塹之稱，拿現代的眼光看，所謂天塹也者，確是已經過去了。但是，這條長江對於擁有強大海空部隊的攻方，固然毫無天塹的價值，而對於既無海軍又無空軍的共產黨，天塹的價值却還沒有完全消失。共產黨既無海軍，便無法馳　如意於江面，既無空軍，便無法制壓政府兵糧的活動，亦無法掩護強渡的衝擊。共軍渡江的主要工具，惟有木船之類。行駛緩慢容量有限的木船之類，編成目標不大的小部隊，在守軍薄弱地方偷渡，容有成功之望，然必甚難立足於江岸，作為繼續渡江的接應，要有效的渡江，必須展開大規模的登陸戰，以奪取南岸的重要據點。大規模部隊暴露在毫無掩護的江面上，恰給守軍的岸上大砲及兵艦射擊與飛機投彈以交轟的明顯目標，其危險性可想而知。</p>
<p>渡江之戰所將遭遇之江面上的重大消耗是如此，而渡江之先奪取北岸重要橋頭堡，也並不是輕而易舉的事。大凡河流沿岸城市所在，必是渡口所在；城市愈大，渡口愈重要。共軍要大規模渡江，是不能不先攻奪北岸一二重要橋頭堡的，而浦口·安慶·漢口·荊沙等處，就是他所必要拿下的。可是這些據點，有的一面憑江，有的兩面環水，共軍的攻擊精神雖高，却究竟無法完成包圍，而逼向各該據點外圍愈近，愈入兩岸守軍及兵艦大砲射程。尤其像漢口及荊沙外圍的湖沼區，不利於攻方大規模兵團運動，空軍更易發見轟炸目標。北岸重要橋頭堡的攻守戰，共軍要達成佔領任務，恐亦不免遭受重大消耗。安慶圍攻亙二十餘日而不得逞，就是一例。</p>
<p>從荊沙到海口二千餘里的長江，守軍固需要大量兵力，攻軍却更需要大量兵力。共軍要進行渡江之戰，非運用百萬以上的兵力不可。這百萬以上的兵力，消耗於爭奪北岸橋頭堡及江面者，將可能達於數十萬。而且從令渡江成功，也不一定就是擊破了政府軍的主力，傳檄可定二十餘省市，往後還有長時期的戰爭。江南多雨，道途泥濘，幾個月的雨季，也可使共軍的行進感受相當困難。</p>
<p>共產黨在幾個月內，攻佔了那樣多的重要城市，軍事發展之迅速，實在驚人。但軍事佔領之　，必須繼之以政治的消化，而消化之費時，將遠甚於軍事佔領。現在共產黨所真正要努力的事情，應尚不是新的軍事成就，而是消化既得的地盤。不過　令地盤的消化已有成績，而政治上仍有一個困難和國民政府相同，就是「參軍」「獻糧」之不一定為人民所心願。國民政府的「徵兵」「徴糧」，是要人民出錢出命，共產黨的「參軍」「獻糧」，也是要人民出錢出命。要人民出錢出命，他們內心總是不願意的。戰爭若繼續下去，便不能不繼續「參軍」「獻糧」，這也可成為中共潛伏的政治危機。何況北方各省，經過幾年的戰禍，人口死亡流離之外，不是甲來要徴，就是乙來要參，兵員的來源，也一定不旺盛了，有時將不能適應前綫補充之需要。</p>
<p>戰爭總是對經濟不利的。國民政府統治的二十餘省市，除最近二三省不靖外，可說大都是安定的。這些安定地方，經濟狀態巳是如此惡化，共產黨統治的區域，則大半曾罹戰禍，經濟衰落自必更甚。同時，中央銀行的庫內，還有黃金幾萬兩，外匯及銀圓各幾千萬元，而金融猶如此混亂，共產黨的人民銀行庫內，縱有金銀準備，亦必遠不及此數量。過去政治勢力限於農村，財政金融較易應付，今巳掌握幾個大城市，情形會兩樣，捉襟見肘之勢，殆將不可避免。繼續作戰下去，只有促進共區經濟的迅速崩潰。</p>
<p>如果雙方都瞭解自己的困難，必然知道「和為貴」所以，我認為和談是應該有前途的。問題就在八項條件如何解決？</p>
<p>我以為和的目的應是為國家求治。如果是為國家求治，則一切足以引起大亂的因素，應即消除。關於軍隊改編問題，稍一不慎，是可引起大亂來的。假若改編違反了平等原則，甚至某一方面受另一方面的　，便可能發生很大的騷動。這種騷動的發生，還可能影響到地方武裝。如此，和的結果，不僅不能為國家求治，反將增加人民的痛苦。那時的痛苦，必無數倍於將近四年來大家所身受者。最好的辦法，還是雙方軍隊同時各就驻地自行整编，分期完成，由共同組織之機構切實點驗。</p>
<p>其次，我以為和的目的，應是求兩黨相安。如果為求兩黨相安，則一切足以引起蓄恨的因素，應即消除。關於所謂「戰犯」問題，本來只是一句空話，然而却規定了戰爭責任片面的屬於國民黨。這自然不是公道的說法，也不是國民黨所願承受的。而且戰犯名詞的存在，將使若干人恐懼將來也蒙上同一罪名。我看共產黨不必堅持此一條件。</p>
<p>聯合政府也將是雙方爭執的重要問題之一。不少人士主張南北隔江分治，經過一時期後，再合而為一。他們認為共產黨的「新民主主義」與國民黨的三民主義，實頗相近，不過由於長期的戰爭，互信甚難驟立。分治以後，彼此在政治經濟上的設施，表現日益接近，互信亦即日益深厚，合而為一，必將成為自然趨勢。如果共聚一堂，而鈎心鬥角，互相排斥，常使政局動盪，影響社會安定，倒不如暫行分治，由於各種方面的相需相求，還可改善情感，趨向合作，反有利於人民。然而分治有無可能，和談雙方是否會因某些條件不能意見接近，轉而作此打算，我個人不欲懸揣。我只能說，假若別的條件談不妥，能先走這一條路，使人民免受戰禍，總比打仗好。</p>
<p>國際形勢，日見緊張，我們國內如能得到和平，對於世界的安定，將是一大幫助。假若戰爭仍然延續，說不定世界大火災，先從我們身上燒起來。（四月十二日上海）</p>

<h3>針對大西洋公約　東歐完成大聯盟　防德或其盟國侵略為目標</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十六日廣播：普拉格訊，蘇聯之東歐二盟國已完成大規模之「軍事協定網」，使東歐全部與蘇聯結合。捷克與匈牙利今午在布達佩斯簽訂軍事協定時，曾發表聲明，指責「西方帝國主義國家之締結北大西洋公約，其用意在復興法西斯蒂德國，並威脅世界和平」。捷匈協定係由捷克之柴薩波托基與匈總理杜比簽字。按蘇聯與東歐國家均巳分別締訂此類協定，東歐各國間亦互訂此種協定，捷匈協定為此類協定之第二十一種。從此以後，蘇·波·捷·匈·羅·保·南等國已均訂有雙邊協定，成一整體。如南斯拉夫之狄托能遵守其約言，則今後東方集團七國於任何一國認為已遭受德國或「直接或間接與德國聯合之國家」之「威脅」時，即將全體採取一致行動，以資抵禦。</p>
<p>〔合眾社布達佩斯十五日電〕共情局日報十五日指斥「美國資本主義者」，以阻撓「人民共和國」的任務交付狄托·匈共黨編輯李維埃在該報撰文稱，狄托及其集團「巳成為美國帝國主義者的部下，與貝文·勃魯姆·加斯貝利·明真諦及戴高樂的地位相同」。渠稱，「美國交付給狄托的現行任務，為阻撓人民民主國，特別是保加利亞·阿爾巴尼亞及匈牙利。狄托政權實際上是北大西洋公約的非正式的同路人」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社布達佩斯十六日電〕匈牙利與捷克今晨在此簽訂一項友好互助條約，此項條約實際上與東歐民主國家間早先所簽訂之一切條約相似，主要目的在防止德國之侵略。惟該約並回溯以往匈捷兩國之關係非常緊張，現必須由兩國政府努力，使之能改變為可互相依賴與友好。該約又宣佈兩國必須採取一切適當措施，阻止德國或德國之同盟國對兩國之進攻。如締約國一方與德國或其同盟國發生戰爭，則另一方必須以一切可供其使用之資源作軍事或他種援助。簽約國雙方皆不能與他國作反對對方之任何同盟或參加任何反對締約另一方之行動。簽約國雙方應履行與聯合國憲章相符合保持和平之行動。</p>
<h3>柯拉洛夫繼任保總理　羅副揆兩人免職　由鮑克夫人羅加補遺缺</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕索菲亞電台今日宣布，保加利亞外長柯拉洛夫，巳被任為保國部長會議主席（即內閣總理）。柯拉洛夫為保共黨領袖之一，在過去保國官方文件中，曾稱之為部長會議副主席（副總理），另一副總理柯斯托夫最近因「犯有重大的政治及反黨錯誤」巳被免職。美國務院發言人今日曾表示相信狄米特洛夫之赴蘇，意即渠已擺脫政府及黨務之謂，此舉同時亦可透露最近保副總理柯斯托夫及保國其他共黨份子被整肅之若干新背景。</p>
<p>按柯拉洛夫係於一九四五年十二月當選為保國全國議會主席，一九四六年九月接任保共和國臨時總統之職，是年十一月重選為保共和國主席團主席，旋即授命狄米特洛夫組織內閣。一九四七年十二月渠提名喬其埃夫為外長兼副總理，不久奈契夫氏繼任保全國議會主席。</p>
<p>〔合眾社布加勒斯特十六日電〕羅馬尼亞十六日撤換其三名副總理中之二人，以其中一職授於共黨巨頭鮑克夫人。曾在莫斯科受　之鮑夫人，本巳任外長，被人視為巴爾乾半島上最重要共黨員之一，現因此而在羅政府繼承系統中晉升一級。羅馬尼亞人民共和國主席團任命鮑克夫人繼農長薩伏勒斯柯而為第二副總理，並任命財長繼文化部長伏埃泰克而為第三副總理。</p>
<p>鮑克夫人於一九四四年隨蘇軍返羅以後，在指導羅國事務方面雖有勢力，但未曾加入政府，直至一九四七年十一月七日方被任為外長。數月以後國王密契爾即出亡國外，羅馬尼亞於是成為人民共和國，社會黨與共黨合併而成新工人黨。渠諒將在第二副總理新職中，保持外長一席。</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦十五日電〕史達林與狄托爭執所引起之內部危機，今日集中於布爾希維克老革命者狄米特洛夫之退出保加利亞政局。狄氏原係總理兼保共黨書記，此次赴蘇「返國休假」，實為蘇聯衛星國間爭執中近來數次行動中之最近一次。此等衛星國因受史達林與狄托間思想衝突之牽制而備感痛苦。東歐國家要員之再更動，動機何在，尚無證據可得，或許須在數週，甚至數月以後，方可知其用意何在。惟一般咸知史達林與狄托交惡起，保加利亞內部始終爭鬥不巳。保共殊難商談對付狄托之方針，因該黨內部有許多派系均在爭取個人權勢及觀念原則。柯斯托夫雖以溫和處理其國家的共產主義理論著聞，當時則曾領導攻擊贊成狄托之人民。自柯氏失寵於黨公佈後，狄氏即未公開有一言述及柯氏，此點或可供最近事態發展之綫索。</p>
<h3>史密斯談史達林　認為渠體格堅實似甚健康</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十六日電〕美國駐蘇前大使史密斯，十六日表示蘇聯史達林總理並不如報紙所傳時常患病。史密斯答覆電台訪員之問題稱：予認為史達林並未患有重病，渠之體格極堅實，渠現似甚健康，高家索人通常皆壽命極長。</p>
<h3>携有機密文件　貝文返抵英</h3>
<p>〔路透社南安普敦十五日電〕貝文外相今日乘「莫里泰尼亞」號郵船自美抵此時，巳有機密重要文件若干，密藏於鋼箱中，用專機自華盛頓載抵此間，待貝文抵英後立即啓親。惟以鋼箱鑰匙並未隨機携來，故由貝文召來船上工程師將鋼箱擊破取出文件。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南安普敦十五日電〕貝文外相今日抵此談稱，渠「仍堅信大西洋公約係保持戰後和平中所採取的最重大步驟」。渠繼稱，「但欲解決許多世界問題，則尚須相當時日」。</p>
<h3>美英法將澈底研討　西德國未來地位　四強協議機會仍不放棄</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕西德未來地位將為復活節假期中，英美法三國領袖在柏林及三國首都討論主題之一。三國外長一星期來，巳先後解決西德佔領法規，西德政府成立後，三區行政機構及拆卸西德工廠之三大棘手問題。惟此三大協定之發表，巳引起兩項其他問題。</p>
<p>第一，為德國基督民主同盟與社民黨就西德基本法律及憲法之爭執。可靠方面謂社民黨拒不遵照佔領國之意見修改西德憲草，尚不足以表示其最後態度。一般威信社民黨下週三在哥資堡開會時終必屈服於盟國壓力之下，而放棄該黨自行提出之憲草。惟此等發展，對於德國政黨他日與盟國間合作，終不免留有不愉快的痕跡。另一重大問題乃為因西德協定之宣布，而引起的蘇聯方面的態度與柏林的未來地位，連日盛傳蘇聯巳開始試探解除柏林封鎖及召開四強外長會議討論整個德國問題之可能性。英官方巳否認蘇聯政府曾向英國作此試探，惟蘇聯曾否向美法試探則尚不得而知。美駐德軍事總督克萊表示尚無跡象可證柏林之封鎖即可解除。惟艾契遜國務卿被詢及此事時，則僅作含糊答覆。西方國家之官方意見乃為西德政府之設立，西德三區之合併，以及其他改革並不妨礙最後與蘇聯獲致協定之可能性，但亦承認於西德政府接掌政權後，與蘇之協定成立必更困難，故西德政府成立前之數週，亦為獲致四強協定的最後機會，若不抓住此一機會則柏林問題仍將繼續存在。</p>
<h3>蘇為博取德人歡心　可能令波歸還德土　比暫緩接收德西疆割讓地</h3>
<p>〔合眾社柏林十六日電〕西方國家外交界接獲消息：蘇聯可能將命令波蘭以下西里西亞之一部份歸還德國。西方官員稱，此舉企圖重建蘇聯及共黨在德國失去之若干聲望。此項計劃如告實現，波蘭將以下西里西區工業區之一部份歸還德國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社白魯塞爾十五日電〕外交部今夜宣布，比利時暫緩接收西方佔領國最近規定割讓之德國邊疆土地。此項割地共五十二方哩，均在西德邊界。</p>
<h3>正式脫離英帝國統治　南愛宣布為共和國　北愛邊界嚴密戒備防止動亂</h3>
<p>〔聯合社杜白林十六日電〕南愛爾蘭今日正式成為自由共和國，此乃七百八十年來反對英帝國統治之最後一步。共和國成立儀式將在郵政總局大廈前舉行，卅三年前該處曾發生復活節革命流血慘劇，目的亦為爭取獨立。</p>
<p>〔路透社貝爾法斯特十五日電〕北愛爾蘭政府已下令於週末從事嚴密戒備，以防可能發生的動亂，對於愛爾蘭共和軍人員之進入北愛爾蘭，尤予特別注意。星期一政權移轉之日，愛爾蘭反對分裂同盟擬在南北愛爾蘭交界之處舉行要求愛爾蘭統一之示威，北愛當局屆時將加緊邊界一帶之巡邏。</p>
<h3>聯大開會期　尚需四星期　以色列入會九月始能實現</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十六日廣播：成功湖訊，關於以色列加入聯合國問題，可能延至九月中聯大舉行常會時始予通過。聯大決議將以色列申請入會一案提交政委會研討，其主要原因，係因多數代表顯欲迫使以色列對聖地國際化及阿拉伯難民問題表示讓步。聖地調解委員會對於此兩問題之報告，須延至九月開始能提出。阿剌伯代表諒必爭持以色列之入會不應等待該兩問題解決後始於通過。預料大會開會期間，至少尚須繼續四星期，除討論以色列入會問題外，並將討論前義殖民地處置問題，南非印僑待遇問題及西班牙弗朗哥政權問題。</p>

<h3>和平大會代表　法限制入境　法婦女協會表示反對</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十五日電〕法國婦女協會今日反對法政府對某數外國尤其為蘇聯與中國參加四月二十日在巴黎舉行之世界和平大會之代表，限制簽發入境護照。世界和平大會籌備委員會今日發表文告，謂法國婦女協會全國辦事處竭力反對法政府此舉，謂此種專斷計劃，證明法政府仇視蘇聯與人民民主國及中國之人民，法政府企圖阻止此若干國之人民表示　求和平之願望，故今巳請法政府准許此若干國之代表入法，其他法國左派組織亦反對法政府限制簽發各代表之入境護照。</p>
<h3>日眾院通過　二萬億元預算案　預料參院全會可予通過</h3>
<p>〔合眾社東京十六日電〕日眾院十六日未予任何修正而通過二萬億日元之預算案，如盟軍總部財政顧問道奇所勸告者。通過之票數為二三一對一一三票。參院定於十八日以此案交小組委員會審查，於十九日在參院全會中予以表決。參院之通過此案諒屬必然。議院通過此案後，將使日本有戰後之首次平衡預算案。</p>
<h3>伊朗備受蘇聯壓迫　擬向安理會申訴　蘇伊條約第六款不適用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十六日廣播：伊朗大使館頃否認一九二一年之伊蘇條約係被迫簽訂之說。伊使館稱，伊政府僅取消該約中之第六條，該案規定在某種情形下，蘇聯得派遣軍隊赴伊。伊使館稱，聯合國憲章第一〇五條已規定，為使聯合國機構實施其任務起見，各會員國應予該機構以各種必要之特權，故伊蘇條約之第六條已不適用。</p>
<p>〔合眾社德黑蘭十五日電〕今日此間悉，伊朗已通知蘇聯，聲明蘇方如不寬馳其對伊朗之壓力，則伊朗諒將向聯合國安理會申訴。可靠人士稱，伊朗已請今晨啓程前往莫斯科之蘇聯大使將此告知蘇政府。</p>

<h3>歐醫學社會化運動</h3>
<p>醫學費用高昂，已非常人所能負担，歐洲大部分國家，乃採取醫院醫生免費應診，一切費用由國家供給。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕醫生在歐洲最近二十年來已逐漸趨向社會化，公私衛生保險計劃甚為普遍，各地醫生參加有組織之社會服務者日益眾多。但言此種計劃規模之廣泛，除蘇聯外尚無一國能與英國抗衡。因在英國人人可獲免費治療。醫學社會化運動主要原因有三，即人民對於社會暨經濟安全之希望促使治療工作普及，五十年來醫學進步結果，儀器精密，費用高昂，巳非常人所能負担，且戰後歐洲缺乏醫生與藥品，許多國家分配欠周，尤其是農立國鄉區。</p>
<p>一部份衛生計劃係屬強迫性質，另一部份則限於特定薪水階級。許多國家遠在十九世紀中業即採取醫學社會化形式，其保護計劃或出自動。至於官方舉辦強迫性計劃，大體上乃戰後政治思想之產物，尤以東歐各國為然。一九四八年，英國實行全民衛生服務，先是一九一一年衛生保險法僅規定經費先是稅收。進益在一千六百八十美元以下者始得保險，預防疾病，約占全國人口一半。</p>
<p>據聯合社調查歐洲十五國結果，其醫學社會化概況如下：</p>
<p>挪威—凡進益在每年擲幣九千元以下之職工，依法均應參加疾病保險，人數占全國總人口百分之八十左右，保險費六分之一由資方代繳，其餘自行負担。進益較多者參加保險與否隨便。病人可自由請醫，診金在保險計劃項下動用，藥費自出。關於醫生診費，法規亦有規定，初診挪幣五元，復診與三診每次四元。專家診費十元。</p>
<p>瑞典—政府定於一九五〇年七月一日起實行強迫衛生保險法，經費由官方撥款或另徴特稅。國會現正審查一種統盤衛生計劃，規定全國醫生應受政府雇用，約十年為期，瑞典各地共計醫院六百五十一所，內僅十三所屬於民營。貧民就診全部免費，其餘病人局部免費。</p>
<p>丹麥—自一九三二年以來，十七歲以上人民必須保險，每年繳費丹幣七十五元，至其進益達到政府規定之限額為止。在此期間可自行選擇醫生，每年得更換一次，保險費用豁免，大多數醫院均歸中央或地方政府管理。</p>
<p>波蘭—一九四五年開始實行醫學社會化。醫生每日至少負責診治國營事業工人五小時，月薪波幣三萬元，向衛生部領取。公畢方可自由行醫。波蘭現有內外科醫生八千元，戰前多至一萬四五千人。全國人口總數約二千四百萬人。</p>
<p>捷克—自一九四八年七月後，全國人民百分之九十五參加衛生保險，免費治病。工人所徴保險金約占工資百分之三，店員則占百分之四至五，不足之數由國庫貼補，所有醫院均為國營。</p>
<p>匈牙利—手工業工人巳自一九二七年起強迫保險，醫藥費本人負担百分之一，资方負担百分十二。醫生薪給有限，但工作甚忙碌。政府現擬將強迫保險制度擴大至全體人民。</p>
<p>保加利亞—政府實行國營衛生計劃後，人民所受醫治服務巳較過去私人醫生大見改善。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞—自一九四九年一月一日以來，各工會會員一百五十萬人及其家屬約四百萬人可免費治病，但羅馬尼亞總人口百分之八十五為農民，農民尚未列入衛生保險法範圍之內。</p>
<p>德國—一八七九年俾斯麥首相提出社會保險法後，即舉辦強迫衛生保險，至一九四五年止，凡月薪三百馬克以下之工人均參加。西德各地大致推行此種計劃，但柏林一地略有改變，藥金豁免，出診每次五馬克。病人在一定時期可照X光，次數有限制。</p>
<p>蘇聯—醫學全部社會化，人民可自由就診，次數無限制，不問居家或入院。醫生薪金與醫院辦公費等均由國家供給，一九四八年總預算規定衛生經費在二百億盧布以上，依照官價約合美金四十億元。</p>
<p>法國—月薪一萬九千法郎以下者負担保險金百分之六，雇主代繳百分之四。優秀醫生可與醫院，分科主任享受同等藥醫，每晨在院應診，診費由院方依照病人進益訂定，徐時另接私人生意。</p>
<p>義大利—最重要之國營醫學組織由資方捐款，占每一工人月薪百分之五。工人並不繳費，但其本人與眷屬每年可入院治療一百八十天。院內醫生各管病人二千至四千名，無論治病與否，概由院方依照病人數目每名付薪二百七十至三百四十里爾，約合美金四角七分至六角。</p>
<p>西班牙—自一九四二年以來，依照衛生保險計劃，共約一千六百萬人得享免費治療優待，包括月薪西班牙幣一千元以下之職工及其眷屬在內，該項計劃係由勞工部主管。職工所繳保險金占月薪百分之六，資方亦同樣數目，餘為政府補助。</p>
<p>葡萄牙—國營或市營醫院依照病人進益豁免全部或一部份醫藥費用。大工廠均自聘醫生為工人免費治病。政府去年共付葡萄牙幣二千八百九十八萬八千元，以補各醫院經費之不足，合美金二百十七萬四千一百元。</p>
<p>比利時—尚無社會化計劃，但工人一百九十萬名依照社會安全法，辦理登記，參加預防疾病保險。治療費用悉歸自負，事後得斟酌情形發還一部份。</p>

<h3>潘公展建議··發行地方券</h3>
<p>席　潘公展諸氏會對解救目前經濟危機，請求中央准予發行地方劵。潘氏稱：人民對央行所發金圓劵已失信仰。如財部能核准若干商業行荘，存足準備金，發行地方劵，則信用當可較佳，惟關鍵則在央行是否能將發行欄分予商業行荘耳。嚴諤聲稱：關於發行地方劵，以前卽曾有專家，加以研究，非得中央支持無法實施，至準備金方面，央行於上次收兌金銀時，各行荘均已兌換殆盡，不妨以紗布等物資作準備，並由商業行荘共組聯合準備委員會，保管準備金，及管理發行。陳秘書長對上項建議，極表贊同，表示將於劉財長週一返滬後，召集地方政府及各法團負責人，對此次所携返之中央經濟決策，加以商討時，予以提出，並希望由參議會邀集各界領袖，共同研討此一問題。</p>

<h3>陳大慶招待記者　談經濟治安問題</h3>
<p>若干學校組織警衛隊應予取締··長江北岸各地身份證一律無效</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕淞滬警備司令陳大慶，於昨晨十時，在該部會議室招待記者，對本市經濟及治安問題發表談話如下：（一）日來本市經濟情形嚴重之至，物價一日數跳，市民生活，已瀕絕境，社會治安，大受影響。湯總司令與劉攻芸部長就經濟問題已交換意見多次，將俟劉部長返滬後，立卽召開緊急會議，商討制止物價狂漲辦法。對於米煤等主要物資，將積極疏通來源，投機取巧操縱壟斷等不法行為，將嚴予取締，尤其最近銀元狂漲，銀元販掀風作浪，刺激市面，其幕後且有人操縱，刻正嚴加偵查，將予全盤取締·（二）最近有若干學校學生自校外遊行等活動被禁制後，竟在校內從事非法活動，例如組織警衛隊，其中且有使用武器，構築工事者。此種行動固屬幼稚可笑，在法律上亦絕無根據，如彼等為安全而出此，則警備部負有保障治安之職責，需要時可派軍隊保護。故此種活動應由學校當局取締解散，否則將對學校加以封鎖或採取其他維持治安之措施。（三）本市人口複雜，一般調查統計不甚確實，致近月來發生命案盜案多起，不易破獲。茲決加以整頓，除居住市區之固定戶口請市府切實清查外，流動戶口將由京滬杭警備總部向中樞建議，所有舟車飛機旅客一律憑身份證購票，到達目的地後，亦一律憑身份證住宿旅館。長江北岸各地身份證今後一槪無效。（四）關於釋放政治犯問題，該部迄未接奉正式命令。陳氏認為一切仍當以和談進行如何而定，如和談成功，目毌須再加以扣留。在目前和談期間，此並非急需解決的問題</p>
<h3>陳大慶石覺兩氏··對調說已成過去</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕淞滬警備司令將仍由陳大慶繼續担任，陳氏與京滬杭警備總部副總司令石覺對調一節，已成過去。因當局鑒於本市情況複雜，擬將治安工作與軍事防務劃分。今後陳司令將專　負責社會治安方面。石覺氏將奉命担任浙滬地區軍事防務事宜。</p>

<h3>蘇北橋頭堡戰役　確保長江天塹</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　和香林</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江十四日訊〕烽火一陳緊一陣的燃燒到對江，素以天險見稱的長江，已經開始面臨到歷史性考騐，鎮江在這幾天，引得全國人們的非常懷念，因為它是京滬的屏障，其進退影響今日大局極烈，這裏從本月六日起至十日止，隔江的砲聲就隆隆不息，室內玻窗　物均為搖撼震動。</p>
<p>儀徵的命運</p>
<p>這一次蘇北共軍大舉發動攻勢，除在決意拿下江北僅有的一座孤城儀墩外，其意義有二：一方面做和談的先鋒，便於　價，一方面想打下渡江的跳板，直接來　　京滬的安全。在去年年底，揚州·秦縣·南通國軍相繼轉進之後，共軍就想順手不費力氣的奪下了儀徴，可是事實恰恰相反，在儀徵發動有五六次攻勢，不料終被一位打硬仗不屈服的年青縣長左治人嚇跑了，共軍就非常難過，當一度打到了城門口，向着守軍大喊：「你們揚州大城已經丟了，你們這些傻瓜還想死守這個破豬城嗎？」從這個時候起，大約是二月上旬，儀徵就陷入了一面　江，三面受敵的命運。後來共軍的攻勢雖然暫行停止，實際上，知道這一批地方土共是無法拿下儀徵的，於是在本月六日，突由　縣經六合調來第八兵團的廿六軍由張銘初率領三四千人馬，配備相當齊全，附大砲十五門，費了一夜的工夫，就一舉打下城西北的重要據點胥浦橋，（按胥浦橋離儀徵城有五六里，正當長江沙漫洲港口之北七里處，山巔起伏，河流縱橫，為威脅江防的據點。）一方面共軍的先頭部隊，卽竄到城北的據點　蜡廟，守軍縣保安團在眾寡縣殊下，奮戰不支，旋退守城北大門。</p>
<p>左治人突圍</p>
<p>在七日晚間的八時，共軍的攻勢猛烈了，胥浦橋的大砲，就很密集的向儀徵城內及泗源溝江面發砲達二百餘發。十一時許，縣府中彈起火，城內正在濃烟沖天，共軍一千餘人卽攻入西門，待北門外守軍趕赴城內增援，亦已不及阻擋，旋與共軍發生慘烈巷戰，殺聲震天。左治人縣長卽督率保安團隊衝出火綫綱，退守南門，（該門距離泗源溝江面四華里），不料共軍一部由西門攻入後，卽分兵進駐城東南沙漫洲守軍陣地，就一手控制了泗源溝江面上的砲艦，左縣長知事不妙，卽突出南門向泗源溝公路試行，行至中途儀泗橋二華里地方，該橋頭堡旋問口令，左縣長尚以該橋為保安隊駐守，該問口令者復稱：不對。左縣長在此旋卽被俘。聞現已由共軍押解揚州軍管會。</p>
<p>國軍在六圩</p>
<p>共軍攻陷儀徵後，氣燄囂張，入日拂曉，卽對鎮江當面之三　河，三江營，施家橋，六圩，十二圩一帶，發動猛烈攻勢。共軍在該地一帶發砲達三千餘發，三　河，三江營，施家橋，旋遭攻陷，但十二圩方面雖有進攻儀徵之張銘初部猛攻，經我海軍不斷砲擊，始予鎮壓後退，不敢再行蠢動。</p>
<p>六圩守軍橋頭堡陣地極為堅強，共軍自八日起至十日三天內，卽分由東·西·北·三面，成一弧形陣綫向六圩取包圍態勢。先頭部隊曾一度抵達離六圩四華里之陳家橋附近。在十日早晨那天，鎮江的人們都一致為六圩的得失担心，因為六圩正當鎮江對面，假如一旦棄守，就給予鎮江的影響很大。當晚幸虧守軍及海軍用密集砲火轟擊，共軍始向後退去。現在六圩情勢極穩，並有大批國軍增援，瓜州方面亦頗平靜。共軍滯留在瓜州以北的八里舖運堤那一邊，委實不易偷渡。</p>
<p>鎮揚交界的大橋鎮，新洲，位於江北東岸，是鎮江縣屬第一區，形勢相當險要，是共軍易於偷渡的好跳板。不料三江營方面共軍一部在七日夜那天配合土共大肆進攻，經地方團隊沉着應戰，至十日夜，共軍復大量增援四個團兵力以上猛攻，因寡懸殊，地方團隊乃主動撤移至大港。十三日拂曉，大港守軍經增援後反擊，一舉收復了高橋新洲，並俘獲共軍一千多人。各綫共軍，不得不被迫向北後撤。</p>
<p>渡江的迷夢</p>
<p>綜計這次江北橋頭堡之戰，可說是激烈而有價值的一戰。據非正式統計：此次共軍傷亡在兩萬人以上，損失相當可觀，給予了共軍渡江的迷夢以一個嚴重的教訓，據聞蘇北中共某政委曾在淮海戰役結束後，對國軍判斷：（一）撤守蘇北，全師固江是上策，（二）再添重兵出動空軍，全力掃蕩濱江地區是中策。（三）扼守現據點，不進不退，靜待共軍主力南來，對消兵力，以空間換時間是下策。但這次國軍固守江北橋頭堡之戰，却例外的爭取了先</p>
<p>據此間軍事當局稱：這次蘇北共軍發動攻勢，乃有計劃之行動，儀徵，泗源溝，三　河，施家橋等地雖被攻陷，但國軍有陸海空軍嚴密的配合和防範，故共軍渡江仍屬不可能之事，我們必須隨時提高警覺，防守長江天塹，確保和平堡壘。</p>

<h3>蘭工業面臨危機　發放貸款·解凍存儲銀圓</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州十日航訊〕蘭市工業面臨危機，無法渡過難關之小廠先後停閉者數十家。金融界人士前些時舉行過幾次座談會，醞釀組織工貸銀行團，專負工業貸款之責，並提出具體計劃，以五萬元銀幣貸與大小工廠，俾繼續生產，繁榮西北經濟。此外，尚有請求解決央行存儲銀元，先行貸予亟需救濟的民營工廠，但這些解救西北工業危機的良方，還盤旋在法令手續上，只聞樓梯響，不見人下來。</p>
<p>央行貼放委員會何時成立，遙遙無期，正式貸放，更離逆料。多少為這一連串美夢引誘得「飲鴆止渴」的小廠商，也不願再賠錢去維持生產，紛紛作倒廠的打算了。近來各同業工會會員，終日擠在工業會的小樓上，長吁短嘆，想不出用什麼法子來勸阻行將關門的小廠主再苦待一個時期，等待理想的果子成熟，然後重整旗鼓的幹下去。</p>
<p>蘭州全市的工廠中，除了省營的製革廠，化工廠，水泥廠，機器廠，電器廠，和民營的西北毛紡織廠，蘭州毛織廠，以及幾家大麵粉廠情形較好外，其餘二百廿六家小工廠，有三分之一準備在最近關門。最嚴重的，是八十二家磚瓦工廠，沒有一家維持經常生產，十八家肥皂工廠，卅家紡織工廠，九家製革廠，無不焦頭爛額，其餘九家小麵粉廠，卅九家印刷工廠，八家金屬治製廠，兩家火柴工廠，也處在風雨飄搖之中，岌岌乎不可終日。</p>
<p>工業會的某負責人告訴記者說「假如二百廿六家工廠有三分之一關了門，將有兩千多工人失業，姑不論失業工人的今後生活將如何解決，試想這一批人擁擠到街頭，會給社會一種多大的影響？」</p>
<p>「那末，」記者請教他：「工業會將有什麼策來挽救這個危機？」他報以無可奈何的苦笑。</p>
<h3>安西廳雨</h3>
<p>車子繞過赤金堡，又爬上甘新公路八三八公里處續進，雨越下越大了，但到玉門縣城方只下午二時許，臨時決定冒雨趕程，以極快的行車速度，通過二百多公里的戈壁灘。</p>
<p>在這一段路上，使我們意外的欣賞了戈壁上的雨景，途次除了安西縣屬的莫公灘是一片碧綠的草湖，在淺草上還開着一大片，一大片的淺紅·淡紫·粉白的野花，在歡欣的承受着雨點外，其餘的地帶，差不多完全是長着駱駝蓬的砂磧，這一帶公路的修建是極其省事的，只要測好方向，在戈壁上挖兩條水溝，兩溝之間舖上一些碎石，便可暢然行車，所以這一段路是萬分畢直的。後來雨下得更大了，路面低凹處積成一片片水塘，但車子還是能毫不猶豫的涉水而過。</p>
<p>路南的祁連山和路北的馬　山，漸行漸覺離開我們的視綫，影響綽綽的看不清楚；極目所見的地平綫是穹形的，只有眼前的公路伸到交差點後，幾乎與天相接</p>
<p>車過橋灣鎮，這裏有一條公路伸入馬　山的重鎮公婆泉，雖然客貨運毫無，但七區路局仍於每週行車一次，以資養護；在這裏還有一個人皮鼓的故事：據傳清康熙某次夜夢在沙漠，看到九棵樹和一座橋，橋下有老人告以地名橋灣鎮，並建議康熙在此地建築一座與北京城圈相彷大小的城堡，才與清朝有利。康熙醒來詔令各地查訪此鎮，後來查得安西有此地名，並且有九棵樹，恰如夢境所見，便詔其外甥陝甘總督查某在此地督造城堡，一如北京體制。查某見此地荒涼，不甚介意，隨便督造一座小城堡，敷衍了事，吞沒了許多公帑。後來經人告發，康熙大怒，降旨將查某剝皮蒙鼓，頭蓋骨等製作酒器祭皿，以儆貪污。公路不經過城堡，而且聽說人皮鼓和頭蓋骨現存安西民教館，所以車子並未停留。車上大家談起剝皮的刑罰，雖然太殘酷了，而康熙懲治貪污的　　，猶為民眾所津津樂道，可見人民在受過遜清幾百年殘暴的政治壓迫，也會編造出這一類洩悵的故事，來寓寫他們的情感的</p>
<p>再往前走便是布隆吉，從前是一個人烟稠密，商業鼎盛的大城市，據說有五六千居民，而現在已成一座荒城，城中大部份為沙漠所　　，成為狼羣出沒之區了</p>
<p>下午七時許，於大雨滂沱中行抵安西，安西是關外三縣的中心，除通蘭州有公路外，西北去星星峽，長驅北疆，西去敦煌，出玉門關，可通南疆，西南逾陽關，可　青海，為西域的重鎮。安西的「風」，終年不斷，冬春尤烈，飛沙走石，已屬平常·和吐魯番之「熱」，鎮西之「冷」，合稱關外三絕·有名的「古沙州」，卽在安西之西南，現在已漸被飛沙所埋葬了。</p>
<p>當晚借宿縣自衛隊部內，縣長告訴記者說：安西的面積有四萬三千多平方公里，漢唐時代居民達八萬人，後來逐漸的減少下去，民國十八年還有四萬人，但目前只剩下兩萬二千多人了。過去關外各縣不抽荘丁，都以馬代丁，自今年起，壯丁都須服役，而征丁的結果，是人口再銳減下去，少壯者逃亡他鄉，老弱如婦孺輾轉溝壑，原來的農田荒無了，還談什麼開墾呢？還談什麼移民呢？</p>
<p>地面的遼闊，交通的不便，每個鄉鎮和縣距離常有七·八十華里之遙，（最近的一個淵泉鎮離縣城是七十華里，最遠的一個柳溝鄉離縣城竟達二百六十華里）通常音信的傳遞靠騎馬或徒步，所以政令的推行，實在是牛步化。這兒土地磽　，雨水缺乏，連年的災　已使得民不聊生，再加上供應的不能　免，人民已常久的甘於沉默了！</p>
<p>談到其他光，熱和水的缺乏，人民和文化教育絕緣，九萬餘平方公里的　空地帶，流徒民族帶給關外民眾的煩惱……等等，已是各縣間一致的問題，在後面將一一的報導出來。</p>
<p>在　　的煤油燈下，聽浙浙瀝瀝的雨聲，一直到晨光　微重臨大地之時。</p>

<h3>江防戰急劇進行中　訪安慶前綫　（下）</h3>
<p>— 本所記者　劉藻</p>
<p>共軍有什麼行動，以至砲兵陣地守軍得到空軍的偵察報告，瞭如指掌，空軍掃射與轟炸，更使守軍的士氣旺盛，國軍以立體戰壓倒共軍的「人海戰術」，在立體砲火下，共軍的「人海戰術」是徒增自己的傷亡。</p>
<p>海軍是這次守備戰成功的一環，在它的砲火封鎖下，使城東西兩翼的共軍沒法接近城郊，並且掩護守軍勝利出擊，就是城北郊層層疊疊的小高地，共軍企圖以之逃避海軍的　擊，亦被它側射，遭到重大的傷亡。</p>
<p>第五海防區指揮官張家寶少校，在「永定艦」上與記者暢論安慶之戰，亦覺得是一幕海陸配合的成功戰，衹要守軍要求海軍的砲火在什麼地方射擊，海軍一定很順利的將攻擊重點指向要求方面猛射，但是海軍在「安慶之戰」中亦有百餘名戰士掛了彩。</p>
<p>海空配合作戰</p>
<p>海空軍這次在安慶守備戰中，與陸軍配合作戰，是最精彩的一仗。空軍的偵察，使共軍的行動始終不能逃脫國軍的控制，衹要</p>
<p>安慶的老百姓</p>
<p>市民在這兼旬以來的守備戰中，有力的　出了力，自十八歲至四十五歲的男子，一律參加國軍的戰陣，担任民夫，担架，醫療，看護，構築戰壕等工作，他們在砲火喧天的苦戰中，沒一個逃避，亦沒一個怨言。</p>
<p>城內人民生活的安定沉着，真出人意外，他們都有一個信心，安慶穩如泰山，所以他們毫無戰爭的恐懼心理。</p>
<p>這裏一隻皮鞋，衹要二塊袁頭，三隻皮底便鞋，反索價一枚銀洋。前幾天，因為守軍得到華中剿總的犒賞，市面銀洋陡增，市價被銀虫壓低，袁頭一枚亦衹要一萬三千金圓劵，昨日的行情每枚二萬八千。「老總」們拿到銀洋去街上掉換，被銀虫故意壓低，他們亦從無怨言。市民對守軍紀律的嚴明，表示了一致的讚美。</p>
<p>軍民的美滿合作下，今日安慶守備戰表現了極度的成功。</p>

<h3>茶市交易式微</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者　晤茶業有力人士，據告：自金圓信譽喪失後，　匿多年之銀洋，復又活躍市上。查茶葉同業，外銷箱茶，已將外匯移轉證　值，而內銷茶除一部份以黃金喊售外，目下亦漸按銀元呌價，因此折成金圓，瞬息千變，新高峯層出不窮，較前大有面目全非之　，惟買氣趨縮，交易遂猶式微，純屬空喊居多。</p>
<p>桐油邁進</p>
<p>桐油昨市，自月中指數發表後，同業方面，大都忙於籌付職工薪金，因此無意授受，惟賣方呌價仍按黃金　值，足度每担三錢三分，青油每担四錢，正副各牌西洪，每桶三錢八分，比前雖乏　　，而以當日金價核算，則猶邁登高峯。至於中信局收購之足度桐油，收價續維原判。</p>
<h3>市塲散步</h3>
<p>— 看臺客</p>
<p>香港禁金　有何影響</p>
<p>前天起，央行掛牌用銀元收進黃金，第一天掛牌價為金一銀四十八元，第二天為一比五十元，昨為一比五十二元，大有一面高抬金價，一面壓低銀元的二重作用。</p>
<p>前天，我在本報上，已就高抬金價一事，加以分析，提醒讀者火燭小心，唯恐毛中有病。現在，我還可以補充幾點材料，與前次分析的結論，也相符的。</p>
<p>（一）香港正自前四日起，禁止居民買賣黃金，並不准人民持　，香港當局卽將強制收買。</p>
<p>過去，香港金市，常常刺激穗滬金價的外因之一，此舉消除了這個外來刺激。</p>
<p>（二）香港當局要強制收買民間存金，當然就要公佈一個收買的官價。這個官價，依港幣和美匯，及港幣和英鎊的聯鎖比價合算起來，加運費水脚，每兩不會超過二百港元多少的。但港地未禁市前的黃金市價，為每兩三二〇港元。所以，官價一公佈，對於國內金價，又不無影響。因為可能有若干港金，私運入內的。</p>
<p>雖則，港地商民，正要求港當局決定收買價時，應考慮到商民的利益。可惜問題不在港商利益，而在港幣及英鎊的匯率，都是國際貨幣基金會中的法定匯價，如果變更香港金價，無異港幣貶值及英鎊貶值，於是又要發生像過去南非高價　金一般的糾紛了。英方是否有意再和美國鬥一番？似乎未可預卜。</p>
<p>（三）上述是外來因素。還有一個內在的新因素，就是所謂「財金改革修正案」，已看台客經立院通過，不免又會來個下馬威，拉拉面子的。</p>
<p>今天，我再來談談所謂壓低銀元這一方面。所謂壓低銀元，不過是「倒袁運動」，使小頭帆船都和袁頭看齊面已。我已一再說過，現在要談談的，央行是否有一個腹稿，要把金銀比價，抬到什麼程度？我非肚子裏的蛔蟲，當然不能瞎說。然而，姑且把歷來的金銀比價變動情形，列舉統計於後，供大家參考參考：</p>

<h3>分析今日青鐵大戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本季足球賽，市長盃已屬鐵路隊，幼級盃爲磐隊奪得，乙組聯賽錦標，已成爲磐隊之囊中物，丙組冠軍是瑩光。甲組聯賽錦標是否仍得由青白會蟬聯，抑由市長盃冠軍鐵路隊去包辦雙料錦標，有決於今天最重要之一戰。今天比賽共有兩塲，秩序如下：</p>
<p>上午十時。志超對羣力。（甲聯賽）逸園。</p>
<p>下午三時對青白（甲聯賽）逸園。</p>
<p>上午之戰，兩隊於上次戰成平手，以近況言，志超小將近況彌佳，羣力在南市亦曾稱霸，實力相埒，爲爭取較優之席位，劇戰難免。</p>
<p>青白對鐵路之戰是關係錦標之爭，青白在聯賽中仍保持未敗榮譽，僅曾被精武所迫和，鐵路則衹負於青白一次，兩隊共賽十塲，而青白僅超出鐵路兩分。今天之戰，青白衹許贏與和，則可渡過難關，而得蟬聯錦標。鐵路若能勝青白，則兩隊同分，有待於再決。是戰不啻爲青白奪標之捷徑，亦爲鐵路問鼎錦標之最後一綫希望，雙方在週來都舉行總練習，設謀定計，蓄銳待時，勢必挾其全力以赴。兩隊最近之形勢如下：</p>
<p>隊名（已賽）（勝）（負）（和）總分</p>
<p>青白　十　九　〇　一　十九</p>
<p>鐵路　十　八　一　一　十七</p>
<p>青白之優點在於守，有孟·姜·薛·張·韓·伏等諸飛將把守要隘，休教敵騎渡陰山，要攻破青白之堅固堡壘，須靠兩翼有高速度，勢必事倍而功半，攻堅不克，以致師勞卒疲，在下半時師老而勢衰，固守不穩，徨論進攻，此不可不注意。眾譽「青白有脚」，與「鐵路有頭」者，乃言羅壽福之善射與祿生之善於切入敲關，小羅爲青白之輸血管，小羅能活動，則祿生與中鋒都虎虎可畏，小羅如果被　肘，則青白之攻勢必受頓挫，得失全繫於此，上陣時要看小羅之狀態如何，與看守小羅之鐵路前衛之狀態如何而定，竊以爲曹禮明當非小羅之對手，今天吳嘉邦與高保正勢必加重負担。</p>
<p>鐵路是一隊之演出，有默契之聯絡，前鋒有陸慶祥之頭攻與張傑之竄勢，蕭子文之開路，竊以爲應調蕭任左翼，得增高兩翼之速度，始足予青白以幾重之威脅，炳浩有路與經騐，惜速度之不及小蕭，是所謂進而不可　者，衝其虛也，小蕭能衝其虛而替張傑及小陸子製造機會，故有考慮整鋒綫之必要。青白未必敢抱必勝而輕敵之心情上陣，故鐵路諸將審慎應付，捨棄患得患失之心，亦有　面希望。陣勢如下：</p>
<p>青白</p>
<p>黃仕傑</p>
<p>韓長榮　張仁義　姜聞清</p>
<p>伏乃堂　孟義良　薛沛然</p>
<p>金祿生　羅濤福　劉隆　　顧爾撒　劉體寅</p>
<p>鐵路</p>
<p>廖雄</p>
<p>岳仁孝　吳嘉邦</p>
<p>陸炳生　高保正　曹禮明</p>
<p>吳炳浩　蕭子文　瞿錫根　張傑　陸慶祥　林興義</p>
<h3>市長盃籃球賽揭幕　女子組採用男子規則·冰隊出師勝幼隊　華聯取友隊戰來輕輕鬆鬆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市長盃籃球賽昨晚揭幕，女子組冰隊勝幼隊，廿三比十。此次採用男子規則，面目一新。第二塲因警機棄權，改由綠林與麥令斯作友誼賽，因十分鐘結果，五十一平手。第一次延長時間五十五平手。第二次再延長，五十六分仍未分勝負。因限於時間，即此完塲。第三塲華聯勝友隊，實力相差，打不出勁來，結果六十六比五十，上半時卅七比十八。觀眾二千人左右，對友誼賽激戰情形，最感興趣。</p>
<h3>女子打男子規則　體育史上一新頁</h3>
<p>冰隊對友隊，這是上海體育史上第一次女子正式採用男子規則比賽的第一塲球，也就是市長盃籃球的第一砲。球員表面精神似乎比較興奮些，她們一般的體力是否『勝任愉快』，那是另一問題。</p>
<p>比賽開始後六分鐘，冰隊才由孫經智首先擲中，諸震罰人，第一節三比〇了局。第二節經智再中，幼隊苦戰，符寶珍忙裏偷閒，掛上二分，戰志愈堅，冰隊孫經仁瞬息報復，上半時（十六分鐘）過去，冰隊七比二領前。</p>
<p>第三節還是冰隊的市面，據說該隊有『師生合作』，本節爲十五比四。幼隊幾個人雖小，但在末節內頗表演着活潑的姿態，反較對方大姊們爲得人同情和鼓勵。結果廿三比十，幼隊被淘汰。</p>

<h3>友誼賽勝過正戲　綠林麥令三平手</h3>
<p>麥令對警機，後者遠征無錫戰程未畢，不得意棄權，臨時由綠林隊應作友誼比賽。綠林最初五人爲樂嘉洲·葉雲山·陳正淼，林少華，王存忠。正淼雖開紀錄，麥令華基凱雄等驟以六比二領前，綠林小針急拼，迨嘉洲二罰球，八分平手，小樂繼復連中，十二比十超出。麥令歐納斯萊姆山等緊逼成十六比十四，局勢又變。雙方的投籃都很純熟，遂各不相讓，成拉鋸狀態，廿平後，綠林漸落後，廿五比廿陳國鎮代王存忠，上半時麥令廿　，綠林廿四。</p>
<p>下半時經天淼嘉洲的努力，成廿九平手，麥令再前，最接近的時候相差衹一球，綠林遠射獲分不少，葉雲山五次犯規後，綠林頗有調動，最後小樂一球，卒成五十一平手，不分勝負。</p>
<p>延長時期（五分鐘）凱雄籃下二球，嘉洲二度背籃中的，再成五十五分手。第二次延長，正淼先罰一分，麥令三次未罰中。華基罰平五十六分，始終難解難分。至此時已八點鐘，因尚有一塲，遂不再決雌雄。</p>
<h3>壓軸戲平平淡淡　實力相差不起勁</h3>
<p>華聯友隊爲昨晚第三塲，友聯係平平浦水兩隊之聯軍，傅金聲三秒鐘即獲一球，友聯王微君居然一連兩球，四比三領前。從此華聯不敢放鬆，福善震中松圓俄頃七分，不久二十比八，上半時卅七比十八。</p>
<p>下半時相成替大李，都不起勁，華聯採門戶開放主義，感情用事，友隊得有分庭相抗姿態。華聯樂嘉洲因打了綠林一塲，未出來。李漢庭已改隸康隊，故昨晚他們衹有六人，結果六十六比五十勝友隊。</p>

<h3>甲二組汕隊紅騎　決定星期一重賽</h3>
<p>市體育協會籃球委員會於昨日下午四時假市體育館舉行第五次委員會議，關於甲二組汕隊紅騎之賽後，汕隊於翌日提出抗議，要求保留比賽結果，俟初賽結束後再行重賽，昨經委員會決議如下：查汕隊抗議理由尚無不合，而紅騎復同意重賽，故定於十八日（星期一）下午七時舉行重賽，以昭公允。</p>
<h3>今晚男女三幕</h3>
<p>市長盃籃球今日續有男女組三塲淘汰賽，自下午五時半起在市體育館舉行，門票照舊，分五千，一萬，及對號二萬三種，秩序如次：</p>
<p>黎隊—力隊（女組）五時卅分</p>
<p>康隊—培爾（男組）六時一刻</p>
<p>仁餘—健樂（男組）七時一刻</p>
<h3>乙組乒乓聯賽　今日續有七塲</h3>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽，今日（十七日）自上午九時起共有乙組七塲角逐，均在慈淑三樓精分球室舉行，乙三部種子新星與星光兩隊均屬初次出馬，對方實力平庸，必操勝券。育才皆爲小將，球藝純熟，蛟龍恐難取勝。乙二部三塲，天翔絕非崇本敵手。優聯對帆聲，前者擁有後起之秀周穆南張季良劉國璋等，戰鬥力異常兇猛，後者雖有蔡森雄吳溶江等旅業健將，勢難挫優聯之鋒芒。聯青相逢星火，兩隊咸屬失敗之將，球藝伯仲，必有劇戰。乙一部永五有健將陳振安助陣，銳氣正盛，健新將不堪一擊。今晚原有甲一組一塲，由全綠出戰青聯，前者因主將張菊臣傷腰未愈，已徴得後者同意改期，並已報請主辦當局予以補賽。茲探錄今日各塲秩序如下：</p>
<p>冠生—新星（乙二）上午九時精分</p>
<p>金門—星光（乙三）十時卅分精分</p>
<p>蛟龍—育才（乙三）十二時正精分</p>
<p>天翔—崇本（乙二）一時卅分精分</p>
<p>優聯—帆聲（乙二）下午三時精分</p>
<p>聯青—星光（乙二）四時卅分精分</p>
<p>永五—健新（乙一）下午六時精分</p>
<p>前晚乙一部二蔴隊初次出軍，戰來異常驍勇，叔蘋僅賴錢維變奪得寶貴一分，打破鴨蛋紀錄，結果四對一二蔴奏捷。同部二華遭遇郵思之痛擊，無法招架，以零對五大敗。另乙二部種子招商兵精將強，每人各以直落輕取聯青，五將未見費力。又中農劇門信誼，過程殊烈，中農因首組陳志崑於緊張比數中失利於對方孫惠民之手，影響大局，結果信誼以三對二再挫勁敵，可謂險極。茲錄各塲結果如下：</p>
<p>二蔴勝叔蘋（乙一）四—一</p>
<p>郵思勝二華（乙一）五—〇</p>
<p>招商勝聯青（乙二）五—〇</p>
<p>信誼勝中農（乙二）三—二</p>
<h3>螢光金康今日友賽</h3>
<p>螢光足球隊應金康隊之邀，於今日下午四時借南市體育塲舉行友誼比賽，由臧文彬任裁判，至巡邊員則由雙方各派一人充之，不售門票開放參觀。</p>
<h3>民主盃足球秩序</h3>
<p>九洲—華光二十日星期三</p>
<p>龍頭—三星廿二日星期五</p>
<p>九洲—螢光廿四日星期日</p>
<h3>體育塲足球裁判　今日拍攝全體照</h3>
<p>南市體育塲足球裁判會定今日上午十時在該塲拍攝全體照片，希該會會員穿着制服法蘭絨西褲白府綢衫深色領帶到塲爲盼。</p>
<h3>幼級盃足球決賽　磐隊奪得錦標　一球之差壓倒龍頭乙</h3>
<p>幼級盃決賽於一時半舉行，由磐隊與龍頭乙對壘，裁判何春暉，巡邊張志仁陳吉祥。雙方攻奪不下，磐隊藉十二碼之機會，由司徒厚罰中，先建一功。未幾龍頭謝士英扳成和局。磐隊再接再厲，錢銘司徒厚各斬一關，上半時以三比一結束。易地再戰，龍頭反攻甚烈，由中鋒鵠中一球，成三比二，此後雙方雖然努力，但無建樹。終局磐隊以一球之差榮獲幼級盃。</p>
<h3>龍頭三中紅心　中航意外慘敗　賽情沉悶球迷興趣索然</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕龍頭與中航昨日下午作甲組足球聯賽於逸園，天氣雖好，球迷之興緻則大差，不足二千人。又因比賽之沉悶，水準之低落，及上半時完畢，抽籤而去者不計其數，球塲空氣之慘有如此。結果龍頭上半時中一球，下半時又來二隻，三中紅心，中航雖遠征凱旋歸來，現日竟抱得鴨蛋而去。龍頭踢來亦無往日之緊湊，中航更加一盤散沙，惟競爭則相當劇烈，龍頭隊長夏樹福久未漏臉，昨亦登塲，特別賣力，北方球迷，捧塲不止。</p>
<p>裁判蔣吟僧，雙方展開激戰，勢均力敵，難以進展。皮球衹在中塲盤旋，直至三十六分鐘，夏樹福迫近敵方門前，妙製「搶司」，陳勤突入建功，先陷一關，中航努力反攻，但往往及門而止，無法深入，上半時以一對零告終。休息過後，再展軍容，中航原陣未動，龍頭吳凱敏下野，王步榮入代龍頭，士氣奮發，操縱攻勢，陳勤得球塞入中路，夏樹福快馬加鞭，窮竄而上，一射落荒而去。未幾，金家標犯規，史大法主罰任意球，低傳中央，姜琨接上一射中，橫木彈出，陳勤捲土重來，底綫勾中，姜琨一頂，徐福生剛好接住。至四十分鐘，夏樹福又來「搶司」一次，陳勤伺隙而入，近門一撥，二對零又建一功。一瞬後，龍頭貪得無厭，張金根傳向門前，姜琨竄入一射，又中紅心，成三對零。夕陽西去，銀笛長鳴，中航以三球敗北。</p>

<h3>市長盃羣芳譜</h3>
<p>— 紅塵</p>
<p>江南春好，市長盃籃球例又鑼密鼓緊起來；這幾天，聯賽好戲剛下幕，壓軸大賽，正待上演，球塲風雲，不特是外弛內緊，抑且瞬息萬變：領隊們拉角忙。名角兒們依聯賽中演出爲市價，此刻不喊他一個「隔日頭寸」，那才是傻子。三年來的事實告訴我們，這一只錦標的得主，總是讓一個冷門球隊攫去，給球迷們留下一個玄異的印象，然後來送別籃球季的。所以，華聯可連抱四屆聯賽的銀盃，却不能一親這迷信者認爲奇數的市長盃。三一九八信號隊，哥倫布美艦，以及上屆冠軍大公，先後打破華聯一季連取二杯的美夢。要檢討市長盃男組的賽前大勢，歷史的教訓，我們是唯有求諸命運之神的。</p>
<p>唯其如此，我寗取市長盃籃球的女組一談。本屆的市長盃女組，於一度盛傳要採加拿大規則後，突然，在某次的籃球委員會議上，以五票對四票的緊張差數，通過了改打男子規則，配合這一個大轉變的是報名參加的隊伍，有九隊之多，打破了上海的女籃球史。粥粥羣雌，一反過去的忸怩態了。</p>
<p>或曰：老牌冠軍綠隊，一向隊員很少，此番打男子規則，既未大事羅致新人，而王維珍，吳愛蓮二後衛的一副福相，能否跑全塲，就是一個疑問。其實，規則是改了，這一屆的趨勢，依籃球邏輯推衡，綠隊還是先領銀杯後打球的局面。黃明媛，石宗蘭，朱錦芸，這三張綠隊的王牌，已够作爲穩取錦標的資本而有餘。問題還在一些新起的隊伍像幼隊，冰隊，鷹隊等，她們的原始動作，方從女規則中學會未久，再一經改打男子規則，真不知將打成那一副糟糕的模樣。難怪幾位裁判員，已在担心不幸而被派在女組中執法了。</p>
<p>改打男規則，最吃虧的是黎隊，在身材小，經騐缺二條件下，這幾日來的僅僅苦練，是無法收速成之效的。誰能有這一記手腕，來消除她們惶悚的心理，那才是辦法。譬如說：黎隊的中鋒姚思濂，在聯賽中得了很多分數，但她決不能勝任男規則中顧前濟後的中鋒位置。綠隊有黃明媛或朱錦芸，雅隊有王珊，黎隊中任何一人來當中鋒，都難免貽廖化之譏，錢楚屏雖是黎隊的大姊了，但一向只善攻球，任退須助守的中鋒，亦不相宜。</p>
<p>雅隊，就是聯賽中星華的原班人馬，再加上了朱敏及孫鳳竹，以星華在這次聯賽中的閒散，我恐綠隊及黎隊的平日練習，也要比她們的出塲時認真些。但，此番是發憤起來了，領隊，教練，管理，幹事，一應俱全。從雪白而滬英以至於今日的所謂民立系諸女將，也許是一種傳統上的習慣，練球一向是不及她隊重視的。由蕭瑛·王　玲·張秀麗而至近今的汪澤倫及錢夢月等，似乎都是一種天才上的收獲。但在雅隊旗幟之下，再加潮流的暗示，已幾度於清晨七時，在體育館練習，神射手錢夢月，射來準確依然，朱敏則一向打慣男規則的，而汪澤倫的進步，又是可跟蹤物價的。</p>
<p>所以，雅隊與黎隊，來日爭亞軍的一幕，決不會比聯賽中戰成和局的那仗稍遜些！在女打男規的市長盃中，將是一個拿出經騐的塲合，依雅隊諸球員的打球歷史，應該有一個勝過聯賽的成績產生。</p>
<p>綠·雅·黎三種子隊之後，看賽程表，約翰與鷹隊之遭遇，來爭取這第四種子隊，第一戰就要有一番劇鬥。鷹隊即是大專賽中的滬江，當初與約翰在決賽中的殺得難分難解，僅二月之隔，如今已是形勢大變，鷹隊少了王珊，約翰少了朱敏，顯然鷹球之吃虧較多。然而塞翁失馬，安知非福，乾脆鷹球第一塲即輸了，向落選錦標的圈裏跑，將來與力隊爭一爭落選錦標，倒反有意思些。</p>
<p>至於民立隊，去了錢夢月。汪澤倫及徐秀雲後，已失去了在中校賽稱雄時的實力。至於幼隊，也僅剛在南洋路諸女中前，茁了新苗，此刻與種子隊之間較，尚有一段不短的距離。</p>

<h3>說裁員</h3>
<p>— 愛楊</p>
<p>「裁員减政，緊縮機構」，似乎已經成為每個新官上任後例有的第一件新政。裁汰冗員，以節公帑，這聽來眞是一件了不起的偉大事業！</p>
<p>筆者頃接家鄉來信，說我們縣裏一年半以來換過三任縣長，緊縮過三次機構。自然，也裁過三次員。但有人把現在縣政府的人員數一數，不但不較一年半以前少一個，而且足足還多了九個職員。於是，我對裁員道一「偉政」起了懷疑。再三打聽，才知道裁負云云，就是去了一批舊的，換了一批新的；前門出去，後門進來·猶如中央銀行的條子，早出晚歸，結果還是等于原來。旣得拋售（裁員）之名，又可坐收其利。有人質裁員為今日莫大善政，其「善」其在斯乎？</p>
<p>旣裁了員，自然得發遣散費。少則一月，多則三月以上，以示主持裁員者之仁至義盡；在被裁者而說，不做工作，現拿幾個月的薪水，亦何樂而不為？眞是皆大歡喜的事情。假使一個善於活動的人，甲處被裁卽轉入乙處，乙處被裁又轉入丙處，月月換飯碗，月月被裁員，相信一定可以發一筆「裁員財」。—不過，這僅是「理想」而已，大多數的被裁者，往往都是愁眉苦臉，捨不得自己那隻破飯碗的。被裁者旣不願被裁，而政府却又得付給他不辦公時的薪水。要是索性不裁，則旣免招雇新人，又使舊人心定，豈不善哉！但，這也僅是「理想」而已。舊的不去，新的就安插不下來；錢橫豎是公家的，多化一些又何妨！</p>
<p>筆者目下旅住的城市中，有一個國家銀行，共有員工七十多人；內中副理有九人，襄理有十一人·他們每天的工作是畫到，談天。有一位副理向人說：我們這批眞是「冗員」，可是國家偏不裁了我們。否則，被裁可拿到遣散費幾十個月，我倒大可拿這筆錢去投機一下呢！這裏使人想起政府的算盤是很精明的，譬如說：預備了一百億元遣散費，可裁薪水低且屬于普通機關的員工二千人；以同樣的經費，却祗能裁國營事業機關的高級職員數十人。當然，旣是裁員，自以裁得多的為好，因為自己也就可以安插得多呀。嗚呼，如此裁員！</p>

<h3>最小的共和國</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>聖瑪力諾是世界上最小的共和國，位於鐵坦納斯山上，境內棋佈着中世紀的古塔和雉堞。它整個的張域，都為義大利的領土所包圍。它的全部面積，才不過三十八方哩，人口僅一萬五千人左右。不過，這個小國却已有一千六百年的歷史了。</p>
<p>相傳這個地方是基督信徒石匠瑪力諾所發現的。他於四世紀時，在這裏隱居休養。這塊山地，由一個信奉基督敎的地主獻贈給了他，他死後又傳給了他的信徒們，並且囑「任何外人不得干預」。</p>
<p>聖瑪力諾雖然竭力想與世無爭，但是，它的戰略地位太重要了，是北義大利交通綫的自然烏瞰台。因此，常被捲入戰渦。遠在拿破崙征伐義大利之役時，這個小國就受過戰爭的塗炭。</p>
<p>近在一九四三年，當第二次世界大戰之際，義大利投降後，納粹的裝甲車駛入了聖瑪力諾。差不多過了一年，英國部隊推進到這裏，將它解放，這個蕞爾小國亦毅然奮起，向德國宣戰。</p>
<p>就地理形勢來說，聖瑪力諾的國民，過的是上下奔波的生活。一出門，不是下山，便是上山。尖屋頂的中世紀山城中，一簇簇白色的農舍和敎堂，出現在山坡中，向多岩石的山巓伸延。</p>
<p>在山坡較高處，是首都聖瑪力諾市。這裏有的是厚重大門，狹隘的街道，和尖頂的石頭建築物。建築用的石頭，是聖瑪力諾國民生計的主要財富，並且有久遠的歷史。除了建築石以外，出口貨還有酒和牛。聖瑪力諾的財政不乞靈於鈔票，却依賴郵票。因為它的郵票變化多端，圖案精美，久為世界集郵所喜，每次發行新郵票，總能換取不少外匯。</p>
<p>聖瑪力諾的國政是由六十個議員所組成的國會所管理，他們都是公民投累還出來的。國會再指派兩個人為行政官，任期六個月，是世界元首中任期之最短者。</p>
<h3>吃飯規條</h3>
<p>— 王德雲</p>
<p>遠幾日來，米價飛漲，竟衝破五十萬大關，嚇煞一般升斗小民。這使我忽然想到，我們一向吃起飯來，總是隨隨便便的，但今後實不能再事馬虎了，吃飯必須訂下規條，庶不致誤。否則，「浪費」恐是在所不免的。</p>
<p>茲擬就飯規四條如下：</p>
<p>第一條：飯前須將褲帶略向上移，然後緊縛之。</p>
<p>說明：這樣胃部必受壓迫，飯量卽可大打折扣，旣能省飯，又能不覺腹中虛空，一舉兩得，有利無弊。</p>
<p>第二條：飯時須將身子倒懸，而後食之。</p>
<p>說明：倒掛吃飯，為避免狼吞虎嚥之上策。我們平時總是坐着吃，飯粒順着喉嚨直滑下去，不知不覺間，一「滑」就是幾碗，「損失」浩大，有背「節約」之道。</p>
<p>第三條：飯時不可運動牙齒，須整顆吞下。</p>
<p>說明：這樣可收耐飢之宏效</p>
<p>第四條：不可一口一口吃，該一粒粒的數着嚥下去。</p>
<p>說明：這樣慢條斯理的吃着，一頓飯可從早晨六時吃到夜裏八時，連中飯晚飯都可免去矣，豈不妙哉？</p>
<h3>好吾廬詩</h3>
<p>— 朱愛人</p>
<p>好吾廬詩鈔，常熟蔣鴻逵蔚靑氏著，凡古今體詩七十一首，所作不多而工。五古如戊戌歲權幕矅城，家中話別誌感云：「儒生天地中，造物有何忌，饑寒交相逼，俯仰無立地。潦倒構奇思，幻出依人計，妻孥知我心，悄言忽加議：少小不成名，老大空謀利，人壽無百年，骨肉何輕棄！低首黯銷魂，背面私吞淚；頑婢躱牆陰，感嘆亦欷歔！」情眞語實，白描能手，令人讀之，輒喚奈何。七律如茸城冬夜，偕會稽王秉卿，福州于一誠，湘鄕謝炳臣，金閭吳彥卿花間博飲云：「故拋鄉夢酒頻陳，今夕茸城度小春，紅友漸還眞面目，黃花微露瘦精神。樽前誰作淸平調，江上相逢冷落人，月影丰籠來夜雨，却敎醉袖洗香塵。」一觴一詠，寄感甚深，頸聯紅友面目，黃花精神，恰到好處，心乎愛之。又如燕園幽居雜云：「四面嵐光上畫楹，果然元九住蓬瀛，未貽租稅兒孫累，偏愛園林水石淸，天際樓臺寒有影，雲中鷄犬靜無聲，桃源久與人間隔，樵客休傳漢姓名！」水明沙凈，不染一塵，非有逸才，難能辦此。其餘佳句，如登金陵莫愁湖勝暮樓云：「山色湖光仍六代，英雄兒女各千秋。」幕中誌感云：「傲氣未除知己少，童年已過讀書難。」秋日同婁東陸孝廉心蘭夫子買醉北麓，野蔌山肴雜陳戯詠云：「香壓小槽三斗黍，嫩挑老圃數莖孩。」訪申江單黼卿於虞西甸橋隱舍云：「鷗掠沙痕穿荻過，雁拖山色傍湖飛。」破山寺云：「空潭黃葉亂，曲徑白雲深。」粵東卓鑑秋貳尹卸昭文椽，赴元和任，詩以送之云：「知音千里外，今夕一樽同。」淸明日遊崑山云：「禪心半逐香風醉，山色全經宿雨勻。」均淸麗可誦。</p>
<h3>銀圓的變遷</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>由於金圓劵的惡性膨脹，致使袁大頭身價日增，氣燄萬丈。袁世凱地下有知，當亦可含笑九泉了。</p>
<p>銀圓是舶來品，第一批來中國的是西班牙幣，最早的還在明代末年。其時數量不多，流通並不普遍。到淸朝乾嘉年間，和海外的貿易日盛，銀圓遂大量流入中國。最初祗流行於廣東，福建兩省，到道光年間，浙江，江蘇，安徽，直隸等省，也都流通。後來述內地各省也有，當時有馬錢，花邊錢，十字錢等名目。</p>
<p>繼西班牙銀圓之後，墨西哥銀圓也在咸豐年間流入中國，就是所謂鷹洋。此後三十年中，鷹洋大量流人，其勢已駕於西班牙銀圓之上。英國佔領香港，也曾鑄造銀圓，行使於香港和中國境內，因成色校低，，不大受人歡迎。後改在印度鑄造一種新幣，較香港鑄的好，方在中國流行較廣。日本銀圓也在光緒年間輸人中國，一八九七年改用金本位後，更將其廢而不用的銀圓，向中國輸出。此外安南銀圓，美國銀圓，也都在中國市塲露過臉。</p>
<p>中國自鑄銀圓，是光緒十六年的事。那時因為外國銀幣泛濫，經張之洞奏請，在廣東開　。張之洞之前，林則徐也曾奏請過，復因部議駁覆不准而罷。其時民間亦鑄造銀圓，道光中浙江省曾鑄一兩重的銀圓，咸豐中上海朱裕源也鑄過一兩重的銀幣。因和流通的銀圓價不一致，流行不廣。許多銀爐，銀舖也仿造銀幣，有廣板，建板，浙板，蘇板等名稱，但這些銀幣重量成色不好，不大受人歡迎。</p>
<p>光緒十六年鑄造的銀圓，重七錢三分，花紋為蟠龍，有滿漢文「光緒元賽」，及廣東省造等字樣。龍洋產生後，成績特佳，於是在湖北，江蘇，福建，直隸等省仿鑄流通。後因各省所鑄的銀圓，重量成色不一，流通很受影響，光緒廿七年，乃規定每枚應重七錢二分，令湖北，廣東兩省鑄造，以資劃一。光緒廿九年，天津成立戶部造幣總廠，劃一銀幣形式，就是現在「北洋省造」的那種。</p>
<p>民國成立後，三年頒佈銀幣條例，規定每圓重七錢二分，含純銀八九二三，那就是袁大頭了。南京和杭州迭幣廠成立後，更大量鑄造。民國八年，因市上供不應求，乃將成色减低為八八九五。現今袁大頭的價値，有幾處地方還有年份的分別，不是無因的。</p>
<p>雖然袁頭大量生產，但在軍閥割据的局面下，各省還是自己鑄造。東三省幣，川洋，滇幣，吉林幣，奉洋，名目繁多，形式不一。且成色大大减低，藉資謀利。現今川洋的價値，落在各種銀幣後面，也就是如此造成的。</p>
<p>國民政府成立，改鑄孫幣，孫小頭的成色和分量，原是和袁大頭一樣的；而今價値上要分高低，不知是否是因頭的大小之故。後來，又將銀幣的圖案，改為帆船。但不久法幣制度實施，銀圓遂被隱藏起來，直過了十多年，纔再露面。士別三日，括目相待，睽違十餘年的銀圓，已較昔日身價萬倍了。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Communists Propose Two Demands: Forming a Joint Organization and Crossing the Yangtze River, Hoping for a Government Response by the 20th</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] It is learned that the Chinese Communists have expressed demands to the government similar to those for peace in the Beiping style, and hope the government will respond before the 20th. This news was revealed by a highly authoritative source on the evening of the 16th. According to reports, after Huang Shaohong returned to Nanjing, he fully clarified the progress and crux of the Beiping peace talks. The demands raised by the Chinese Communists include, in the political aspect, the immediate formation of a joint organization to replace the current government. In the military aspect, they call for the immediate realization of crossing the Yangtze River and proceeding with the reorganization of the armed forces. The government feels considerably troubled by these demands and is currently studying countermeasures. The source stated that the main sticking point in the current peace talks is the issue of crossing the Yangtze River, which is difficult for the government to lightly agree to. The "rule by division along the river" principle proposed by the government aims to achieve a ceasefire on the spot and immediately listen to public opinion through universal suffrage to form a coalition government, and then carry out the reorganization of the army, in order to avoid all unnecessary disputes that may arise before the army is reorganized. If the Communist side insists on the demand to cross the Yangtze River, regardless of the method, the government cannot accept it, and the success or failure of the peace talks hinges on this major key. In the event that this issue cannot be resolved smoothly, the government may publish the details of the peace talks to appeal to the judgment of the people.</p>
<p>[Our News] New York, 16th Broadcast: Hong Kong News: The left-leaning newspaper "Far East Public Report" predicts that the large-scale crossing-the-Yangtze offensive by the Communist army will begin "within two weeks" and states that the result will be unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaohong Returned to Nanjing Yesterday to Report: Authorities Convene Meetings to Study Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] After the formal peace talks began, the Chinese Communists proposed 24 detailed clauses based on the eight principles as a concrete plan for implementing the eight conditions, including steps for military reorganization and the organization of a joint government. This plan has been discussed by delegations from both sides and was brought back to Nanjing by Zi Shaohong on the 16th. The government will study this plan and propose countermeasures. Within two or three days, Huang will take the countermeasures back to Beiping to be presented at the meeting for discussion in the hope of reaching an agreement. Furthermore, the formal peace talks held their first and second meetings on the evenings of the 13th and 15th respectively, to discuss the plan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] Acting President Li held a meeting at his official residence in Fuhougang at 8:00 PM on the 16th, summoning He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Bai Chongxi, and others. Huang Shaohong reported on the situation of the peace talks in Beiping, and the participants discussed it.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] He Yingqin reported at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 16th, stating: The peace talks have already begun in Beiping and are currently conducting in-depth research on the plan proposed by the Chinese Communists. Government representative Huang Shaohong was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 13th, but the reason for the delay was to await the end of the discussion of the plan before returning to Nanjing to report.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] Government peace talk representative Huang Shaohong and advisor Qu Wu arrived in Nanjing by special plane from Beiping at 2:30 PM on the 16th. Those who greeted them at the airport included Acting President representative Liu Shiyi, President of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan Chen Kewen, Political Affairs Committee member Zhang Qun, and dozens of others. The special plane was the same China Airlines XT-515 that carried Liu Zhongrong and Zhu Yunshan back to Beiping on the 13th, departing from Beiping at 10:43 AM on the 16th. After Huang got off the plane, he was immediately surrounded by a group of reporters. However, during the relentless and tiring questioning, Huang did not reveal a single word about the content of the peace talks, nor did he give a positive response, only repeatedly saying that the weather was very good today, and adding an inscrutable smile. This encirclement lasted for more than ten minutes, but yielded nothing beyond the phrase "good weather." Soon after Huang broke out of the encirclement, he shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with the government officials who had come to greet him and left in the same car with Qu Wu in a very short time. According to what reporters saw, Huang had important documents in his suit pocket, which were exposed at the mouth of the pocket. When Huang was surrounded and crowded, he often probed with his hand, as if they were extremely precious.</p>
<p>[Our News] China Airlines special plane No. 515, carrying government peace talk representative Huang Shaohong back to Nanjing, took off from Beiping at 10:50 AM yesterday, arrived in Nanjing at 2:25 PM, flew to Shanghai at 3:45 PM, and arrived at Longhua Airport at 5:10 PM, carrying a batch of mail. Special plane No. 531, which was sent by the company to carry Yu Youren to Beiping, was still stationed at Longhua yesterday and may fly to Nanjing tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] Confirmed news: Third-party figures Zhang Lan, Luo Longji, and others may go to Beiping in the near future. The Chinese Communists have intended to invite them to jointly assist in the peace talks, and the relevant persons have conveyed their opinions. It is also heard that most of the invited persons are in Shanghai, and in addition to Zhang and Luo, Yang Weiyu, Leng Yu, Shi Liang, Ye Duyi, and others are also on the list of invitees.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Communists Highly Tout Urban Policies: Current Moderate Means are to Adapt to Reality: New Democracy is Not the Ultimate Goal</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] When an authoritative person met with our newspaper reporter on the 16th, he spoke freely about the current policies of the Chinese Communists and the political views of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. Now, we will select the important points and briefly record one or two as follows: The current policy of the Chinese Communists, while highly touting urban policies, has slightly improved its past means of struggle, especially in the recently peacefully completed city of Beiping. The lives of the residents of Beiping are still as peaceful as ever, but according to Zhou Enlai, the Chinese Communist Party is a revolutionary political party and cannot stop its revolution halfway, nor can it compromise casually. Therefore, the current moderate policy is to adapt to the realistic environment, and they deeply feel the need to replace military methods with political methods to avoid bloody struggles. The New Democracy economic policy advocated in Beiping is close to the Democracy in the Three Principles of the People. The difference is that the Chinese Communists do not regard New Democracy as their ultimate goal. On the contrary, they regard New Democracy as their bridge. The person then stated: The current ability of the Chinese Communists to conduct peaceful negotiations with the government is an example of the transformation of the Chinese Communists from struggle methods to achieving revolutionary goals through political means. Mao Zedong has talked about the land reform issue, believing that there are many points that need to be studied and that it is extremely difficult to handle. Mao specifically pointed out that land reform in Jiangnan can only be achieved at least five years later, and within these five years, if it can be achieved by reducing rent and interest, it can be considered satisfactory. The person also stated: It is rumored that the government delegation in Beiping was treated arrogantly by the Chinese Communists, but this is not the case. Except for the fact that Mao, Zhou, and others did not go to greet the government delegation upon their arrival, the hospitality was very thoughtful. Emotionally speaking, old friends, regardless of whether they are Communists or Nationalists, still value friendship, but if they argue over issues, they will get red-faced and not stop.</p>
<h3>The Delegation in Beiping: Living a Busy and Arduous Life</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] It is learned that after the government delegation arrived in Beiping one day, they stayed at the Six Nations Hotel. That night, the Chinese Communist delegation hosted a banquet, and after the banquet, they held a preliminary meeting to discuss the way the peace talks would proceed, which was to first meet individually, exchange opinions widely, and then hold a formal meeting. At the same time, it was decided that neither side would publish any news about the peace talks. From the 2nd, individual contacts began, lasting for as long as eleven days. The first formal meeting did not begin until 8:00 PM on the 13th. The two sides conducted research separately on the 14th. The second meeting was held on the evening of the 15th. The activities of the government delegation in Beiping were generally to contact third-party figures in the morning, hold internal meetings in the afternoon to exchange views, and talk or meet with the Chinese Communist representatives in the evening, which was extremely busy and arduous. When they returned from the Qin Zhengdian (Hall of Diligent Governance) every night, it was always after midnight. Although Beiping has a beautiful spring scenery, the government representatives did not have time to visit. The Chinese Communists provided very thoughtful hospitality, and all expenses were borne by the Chinese Communist side. The government representatives originally brought three boxes of silver coins, intending to pay all the expenses themselves, but because of the hospitality of the Chinese Communists, they used very little.</p>
<h3>Fu Bingchang Leaves England to Return to China</h3>
<p>Met with Bevin for 20 Minutes Before Departure</p>
<p>[Reuters Southampton, 16th] Fu Bingchang left here today on a British Overseas Airways Corporation flying boat for Hong Kong and then returned to his country.

<h3>Political Affairs Meeting Passes Important Cases: Postal, Telecommunications and Railway Prices to Increase Today: Postal and Telecommunications Increase by 15 Times Overall, Railways Increase by 10 Times Overall</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] The Political Affairs Meeting on the 16th passed the increase in postal, telecommunications, and railway prices, and decided to implement it from the 17th. It is estimated that postal and telecommunications prices will increase by 15 times overall, with ordinary letters increasing from 100 yuan to 1,500 yuan, and ordinary telegrams increasing from 200 yuan per word to 3,000 yuan. Railway prices will increase by 10 times overall, with passenger transport increasing from 40 yuan per kilometer to 400 yuan, and freight transport increasing from 65 yuan per ton per kilometer to 650 yuan. After this adjustment to the new prices, the expenses of postal, telecommunications, and railway enterprises can be covered by 75%, and government subsidies can be reduced accordingly. At the same time, the transportation authorities intend to gradually achieve self-sufficiency. However, in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, where prices are lower, postal and telecommunications fees will be reduced by 20%. In addition, the meeting discussed the issue of north-south remittances and north-south navigation (aviation), and decided to hand it over to the Ministry of National Defense, Transportation, and Finance for research.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Resolves to Consult the Executive Yuan: To Draft a Fundamental Financial and Economic Plan: Readjusting the Salaries of Public Servants to be Reviewed Again: Li Yunliang Hopes the Authorities Will Quickly Organize Value-Preserving Deposits</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] The 15th meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 AM on the 16th, chaired by President Tong. First, the amended financial and economic reform plan proposed by the Executive Yuan was discussed and passed in accordance with the amended opinions of the review committee. A formal response was sent to the Executive Yuan. It was also passed that the amended plan is actually a stopgap measure, and it was resolved to consult the Executive Yuan to promptly draft a fundamental financial and economic plan and send it to the Legislative Yuan for review. Next, the Budget Committee and the Financial and Economic Committee Jin Shaoxian and others reported on the joint review of the proposal by Yang Yifeng and other members that the salaries of public servants across the country should be reasonably adjusted as soon as possible. It was resolved to be reviewed again and discussed at the next general meeting. Then, the report of the Legislative Committee on reviewing the Executive Yuan's request for reconsideration of the Audit Department's Organic Law and the Audit Office's Organizational Regulations was discussed. It was resolved to pass it in accordance with the previous resolution, that is, not to increase the number of personnel. The North-South Navigation Act proposed by Li Yunliang was also submitted for discussion and it was resolved to be reviewed again and submitted to the next meeting of the Legislative Yuan for discussion.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] Legislative Yuan member Li Yunliang told reporters on the 16th that organizing value-preserving deposits and value-preserving insurance is one of the characteristics of the amended financial and economic reform plan passed by the Legislative Yuan today. It is said that the adverse consequences of the disappearance of savings and the outflow of insurance caused by currency depreciation are economic ailments that urgently need to be treated at present. He hopes that the financial authorities will quickly organize value-preserving deposits to reduce the number of currency issued.</p>
<p>[Another Cable] Legislative Yuan member Li Yaolin and more than 100 others, regarding the Xu Wentian case, the letter of inquiry to President Tong Guanxian on the 15th, the one or two members who were referred to as having behaved improperly were Wu Hexuan and Huang Yuren. The reason was that when discussing the Xu Wentian arrest case at the evening meeting on the 15th, Wu and Huang did not examine the facts and blindly defended Xu, which aroused public outrage. After the meeting, most of the members specially jointly sent a letter to President Tong, asking him to correct the improper behavior of members Wu and Huang. The letter was personally read aloud by President Tong at the meeting on the morning of the 16th, and the meeting applauded unanimously. Wu and Huang also attended the meeting and listened silently, remaining silent throughout.</p>
<h3>I Purchased 600,000 Taels of Gold in the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] Confirmed news: In order to replenish the issuing reserves, the government recently purchased 600,000 taels of gold from the United States. The purchase has been negotiated by the Central Bank of China and the US Sinmei Bank, and a portion has been successively shipped to Shanghai. The purchase price of this gold is only 35 US dollars per tael. The 600,000 taels cost 20 million US dollars. However, the current domestic value of gold is 50 US dollars per tael. The 600,000 taels are worth 30 million US dollars, and the government has obtained a profit of 10 million US dollars. In addition to being used as a reserve for the issuance of gold yuan bills, a portion of this gold will be sold on the market to absorb the return of gold yuan bills and reduce issuance. At the same time as purchasing gold, the Central Bank of China also purchased a large number of silver dollars from Australia at a low price, which will also be used for sale to absorb floating capital.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army Attacks Taiyuan with 200,000 Troops: Fierce Battles Occur Universally Around the Suburbs</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] The offensive launched by the Communist army against Taiyuan City is becoming increasingly fierce. In addition to Xu Xiangqian's troops originally stationed outside the city, the attacking Communist army includes the 19th and 20th Corps of Nie Rongzhen's troops, as well as six independent divisions and an artillery division. Therefore, their total strength has exceeded 200,000 troops. The war was unveiled on the night of the 14th. The Communist army initially used various types of artillery to bombard the Nationalist army positions outside the city, followed by dense troop assaults. After the 200,000+ defending troops in the city fought hard, by the morning of the 16th, the Communist army had suffered more than 3,000 casualties, and the Nationalist army had suffered more than 1,200 casualties. The war is still continuing fiercely in the south of the city, about ten miles away, on the northwest side, about forty miles away, and on the east side of the city, at Xialing and San'ershu, about three miles away.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] The battle of Jingxing is intensifying. Director Yan Xishan made a long-distance telephone call from Nanjing at 8:00 AM on the 16th to instruct everything. According to news, Yan originally planned to return to Jingxing on the 15th, but because there are still important matters to be dealt with, he decided to postpone the trip.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] The airports outside the North, South, and East Gates of Taiyuan City could not be used from the 15th due to the proximity of the war.

However, the levy of local taxes by provinces, cities, and counties must be approved by the local people's representative bodies. When the administrative expenses of the central tax collection agencies in local areas exceed 20% of their total revenue, they should be entrusted to local tax collection agencies for handling.

Customs duties shall be paid by purchasing and surrendering Gold Yuan Certificates, which shall not circulate on the market. (5) The price of goods subject to commodity tax shall be based on the wholesale price in the market near the place of production, and the basis for calculating the price shall be specified. If the wholesale price of taxable goods increases or decreases by 25%, the competent tax collection agency shall report to the Ministry of Finance for verification. (6) In the case of profit-seeking enterprise income tax among direct taxes, adopt simultaneous installment methods as much as possible, estimate the tax amount based on the business conditions of various localities and industries, and urge payment to simplify the process. (7) Implement property tax so that the wealthy contribute.

When depositors need to use them, they may sell them to the Central Bank or its designated banks at any time according to the Central Bank's foreign exchange redemption price; (3) The Central Bank should maintain a reasonable market price for foreign exchange transfer certificates to encourage exports and overseas remittances; (4) The import of tobacco and petroleum products shall still maintain the quota allocation method for the time being. The import of grain, cotton, and fertilizers shall be handled by the government separately. For other goods allowed to be imported, merchants may report and transport them for import within the prescribed time limit after obtaining foreign exchange transfer certificates. The types of goods shall be specified and announced by the government from time to time; (5) For goods imported from abroad with self-provided foreign exchange that belong to the types allowed to be imported as stipulated in the preceding article, they may be reported directly to the customs for import.

<h3>Views on the Prospects of Peace Talks</h3>
<p>— Qian Nashui</p>
<p>A country that has been plagued by war for more than twenty years and has suffered more than eight years of devastation by foreign enemies has reached the point of extreme social exhaustion. The people of the whole country fully expected that the victory of the War of Resistance would bring peace and happiness; but contrary to their wishes, they were followed by nearly four years of new wars, with the flames of war burning close to half of China north of the Yangtze River. The people in the war zone have suffered greatly from the disaster of artillery fire, families have been destroyed, and lives have been lost, which is unbearable to witness. The people in the non-war zone have also suffered greatly due to frequent supplies. Therefore, everyone has the same heart and the same reason, and they all hope that the war will end immediately and peace will be realized immediately. Two years ago, I personally participated in the peace movement with the greatest enthusiasm and confidence, but the voice of running around and shouting was finally suppressed by the roar of artillery fire, and this movement died young. At present, new peace talks are underway. Based on the eagerness of the people of the whole country to be governed, these peace talks should have a future. Based on the fact that both sides have their own difficulties in continuing the war, these peace talks should also have a future.</p>
<p>The difficulties of the National Government in continuing the war are very clear in terms of military, political, and economic aspects, and there is no need to point them out one by one. What about the Communist Party? In my opinion, the military, political, and economic difficulties are actually not small.</p>
<p>What are the Communist Party's military difficulties?</p>
<p>First, let's look at the problem of crossing the river. After the end of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, Nanjing was once in a state of extreme panic. This was the best opportunity for the Communist Party to cross the river militarily. However, although the Communist Party won a great victory at that time, it also suffered a great consumption. It would be too risky to carry out the river crossing battle immediately without a period of reorganization and replenishment. Several months of time allowed the Communist army to calmly deploy and arrange the river crossing offensive, and also allowed the government army to step up the deployment and arrangement of defense to hold the river, thus forming the current military stalemate.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River has been known as a natural barrier since ancient times. From a modern perspective, the so-called natural barrier has indeed passed. However, this Yangtze River has no value as a natural barrier to the attacking side with strong naval and air forces, but the value of the natural barrier has not completely disappeared for the Communist Party, which has neither a navy nor an air force. Since the Communist Party has no navy, it cannot move freely on the river. Since it has no air force, it cannot suppress the government's troop supply activities, nor can it cover the impact of a forced crossing. The main tools for the Communist army to cross the river are only wooden boats and the like. It is possible to succeed in secretly crossing the river in small units with slow-moving and limited-capacity wooden boats in areas where the defending troops are weak, but it will be very difficult to gain a foothold on the river bank as a follow-up to continue crossing the river. To effectively cross the river, a large-scale landing operation must be launched to seize important strongholds on the south bank. Large-scale troops exposed on the unprotected river surface provide a clear target for the defending troops' shore-based artillery and warships to fire and aircraft to drop bombs, and the danger can be imagined.</p>
<p>The heavy losses that will be encountered on the river surface in the battle to cross the river are like this, and it is not easy to seize important bridgeheads on the north bank before crossing the river. Generally, the cities along the river are located where there are crossings; the larger the city, the more important the crossing. The Communist army cannot but first attack and seize one or two important bridgeheads on the north bank if it wants to cross the river on a large scale, and Pukou, Anqing, Hankou, and Jingzhou are what it must take. However, some of these strongholds face the river on one side, and some are surrounded by water on two sides. Although the Communist army's attacking spirit is high, it is still unable to complete the encirclement. The closer it gets to the outer periphery of each stronghold, the closer it gets to the range of the defending troops and warships' artillery on both sides of the river. Especially the lake and swamp areas outside Hankou and Jingzhou are not conducive to the large-scale troop movement of the attacking side, and the air force can easily find bombing targets. In the battle to attack and defend important bridgeheads on the north bank, the Communist army will inevitably suffer heavy losses if it wants to accomplish the task of occupying them. The siege of Anqing for more than twenty days without success is an example.</p>
<p>From Jingzhou to Haikou, more than two thousand miles of the Yangtze River, the defending troops need a large number of troops, but the attacking troops need even more troops. The Communist army must use more than one million troops to carry out the battle to cross the river. The millions of troops consumed in the struggle for the north bank bridgeheads and the river surface may reach hundreds of thousands. Moreover, even if the river crossing is successful, it does not necessarily mean that the main force of the government army has been defeated, and it is possible to pacify more than 20 provinces and cities by sending a message. There will be a long period of war in the future. There is a lot of rain in Jiangnan, and the roads are muddy. The rainy season of several months can also make the Communist army feel quite difficult to advance.</p>
<p>The Communist Party occupied so many important cities in a few months, and the rapid military development was really amazing. However, after the military occupation, it must be followed by political digestion, and the time it takes to digest will be much longer than the military occupation. Now, what the Communist Party really needs to work hard on is not new military achievements, but to digest the territory it has already acquired. However, even if the digestion of the territory has achieved results, there is still a difficulty in politics that is the same as the National Government, that is, "joining the army" and "contributing grain" are not necessarily what the people want. The National Government's "conscription" and "grain levy" require the people to give money and lives, and the Communist Party's "joining the army" and "contributing grain" also require the people to give money and lives. They are always unwilling to give money and lives. If the war continues, they cannot but continue to "join the army" and "contribute grain," which can also become a latent political crisis for the CCP. Moreover, after several years of war in the northern provinces, in addition to the deaths and displacements of the population, either A comes to levy or B comes to join the army. The source of soldiers must not be strong, and sometimes it will not be able to meet the needs of front-line replenishment.</p>
<p>War is always unfavorable to the economy. The more than 20 provinces and cities ruled by the National Government can be said to be stable, except for the recent unrest in two or three provinces. The economic situation in these stable areas is already so bad. The areas ruled by the Communist Party have mostly suffered from war, and the economic decline must be even worse. At the same time, the Central Bank's treasury still has tens of thousands of taels of gold and tens of millions of yuan in foreign exchange and silver dollars, but the financial situation is still so chaotic. Even if the Communist Party's People's Bank treasury has gold and silver reserves, it must be far less than this amount. In the past, the political influence was limited to the countryside, and finance was easier to deal with. Now that it has control of several large cities, the situation will be different, and the trend of being stretched will be unavoidable. Continuing the war will only promote the rapid collapse of the economy in the Communist area.</p>
<p>If both sides understand their own difficulties, they will inevitably know that "peace is precious." Therefore, I believe that the peace talks should have a future. The question is how to solve the eight conditions?</p>
<p>I think the purpose of peace should be to seek governance for the country. If it is to seek governance for the country, then all factors that may cause great chaos should be eliminated immediately. Regarding the issue of military reorganization, it is possible to cause great chaos if a little carelessness is not taken. If the reorganization violates the principle of equality, or even if one party is subject to the control of the other, it may cause a great disturbance. The occurrence of this disturbance may also affect the local armed forces. In this way, the result of peace will not only fail to seek governance for the country, but will increase the suffering of the people. The pain at that time will be countless times greater than what everyone has experienced in the past four years. The best way is for the troops of both sides to reorganize themselves in their respective locations at the same time, complete them in stages, and have a joint organization to actually count them.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think the purpose of peace should be to seek peace between the two parties. If it is to seek peace between the two parties, then all factors that may cause resentment should be eliminated immediately. The so-called "war criminals" issue was originally just empty talk, but it stipulated that the responsibility for the war unilaterally belonged to the Kuomintang. This is naturally not a fair statement, nor is it something the Kuomintang is willing to bear. Moreover, the existence of the term "war criminal" will make some people fear that they will be charged with the same crime in the future. I don't think the Communist Party needs to insist on this condition.</p>
<p>The coalition government will also be one of the important issues of contention between the two sides. Many people advocate dividing the north and south along the river, and then uniting them after a period of time. They believe that the Communist Party's "New Democracy" and the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People are quite similar, but due to the long-term war, mutual trust is difficult to establish suddenly. After the division, the political and economic facilities of each other show increasing closeness, and mutual trust is also increasingly deep. Uniting into one will inevitably become a natural trend. If they gather together and engage in intrigue and mutual exclusion, often making the political situation turbulent and affecting social stability, it is better to temporarily divide and govern. Due to the mutual needs and demands of various aspects, they can still improve their feelings and move towards cooperation, which is conducive to the people. However, whether division is possible, and whether the two sides of the peace talks will turn to this plan because some conditions cannot be agreed upon, I personally do not want to speculate. I can only say that if other conditions cannot be negotiated, being able to take this path first and save the people from the scourge of war is better than fighting.</p>
<p>The international situation is becoming increasingly tense. If we can achieve peace in our country, it will be a great help to the stability of the world. If the war continues, the great fire in the world may start burning from us first. (Shanghai, April 12)</p>
<h3>US Aid of 54 Million US Dollars Preliminary Agreement on Mobilization Plan Half for Purchasing Materials, Half for Agricultural and Industrial Construction</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] After the US Senate and House of Representatives approved the continued use of the remaining US aid of 54 million US dollars by our country, it is now awaiting approval by the House Appropriations Committee and the signature of President Truman before it can be mobilized. The mobilization plan has been preliminarily agreed upon by the US Aid Association and the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration. After Lapham returns to China, the two sides can make the final decision. In the agreed mobilization plan, half of the 54 million US dollars will be used to purchase materials, most of which will be used to purchase grain, cotton, and gasoline, and a small portion will be used to purchase coal. The other half will be used for rural reconstruction and industrial construction. After the grain purchased with this remaining US aid is transported to China, the grain rationing in the four major cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Shantou will be extended by at least two months. The grain rationing in the four cities was originally scheduled to end at the end of June, but now it can continue to be handled until at least the end of August. According to a certain authoritative person who told reporters on the 16th, the mobilization of this remaining US aid is expected to begin this month.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] Lapham, the director of the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, has set off from the US and returned to China. He has now arrived in San Francisco and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Forbids Price Increases for Taiwan Province's Highways and Railways</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch of the 16th] The Taiwan Provincial Highway and Railway Bureaus recently requested price increases. Chen Cheng rejected the request today, saying that he is planning to suppress other commodity prices, and state-owned enterprises should take the lead in setting an example.

<h3>Yarn Factories in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Other Places Feel a Daily Shortage of Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch of the 15th] According to the Department of Agriculture, yarn factories along the Chinese coast feel a daily shortage of raw materials. If they do not receive foreign cotton assistance, they will inevitably reduce work in the next five months. Due to the political and military division of China, domestic cotton cannot be transported to the textile centers of Qingdao and Shanghai in large quantities. As of the end of February, the cotton inventory in the coastal area was about 235,000 bales, which can meet the needs of one and a half months. In the second half of the harvest season, coastal yarn factories can continue to obtain about 672,000 bales, which is enough for four and a half months of consumption. In the future, if the yarn factories in Shanghai are forced to close down due to a shortage of raw materials or military instability, one million people will be directly unemployed, and indirect unemployed people are not included.</p>

According to a senior official of the Pacification Office who spoke to reporters, the rebel troops are a rabble. The last time they were lost was purely due to improper command. This time is far from the last time. The commander is General Du Ding, a famous general who defended Changde during the War of Resistance. He has rich combat experience and the rebel troops will never succeed. Also, according to the Pacification Office, Chen Quzhen's name is entirely borrowed by Wang Yuanhua, Cao Zhenya, and others to make a call.

<h3>Guizhou Province's Finances are Not Unified The Area Using Gold Yuan Certificates Only Accounts for One-Tenth Huang Xuchu Plans to Discuss Solutions with the Central Government</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] The financial problem in Guizhou Province has shown a significant lack of uniformity. Huang Xuchu, the chairman of Guizhou Province, discussed solutions with relevant parties when he was summoned to Beijing this time. Huang told reporters on the 16th that the area using Gold Yuan Certificates in Guizhou Province only accounts for one-tenth of the entire province, that is, only a few large cities. The remaining nine-tenths, except for a small part that generally uses silver dollars, are valued in grain, becoming a phenomenon of barter. Huang believes that this phenomenon is inconvenient for commerce and even daily life, but the province lacks proper methods. Although it is under study, no conclusion has been reached. This time he came to Beijing to discuss with the central government to seek a solution.</p>

<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 16th] The issuance of Hunan provincial bank subsidiary notes, originally scheduled for the 15th, has been temporarily postponed.

McDermott made this comment because a reporter asked him to pay attention to a newspaper columnist's claim that the United States would be forced to claim ownership of Taiwan or face the possibility of the island falling to the Chinese Communists. McDermott stated that China's recovery of Taiwan is the same as the Soviet Union's occupation of the Kuril Islands. The disposition of both regions will depend on the peace treaty with Japan.</p>

<h3>Yueyang Primary and Secondary School Students March, Clash with Passing Troops: More Than Twenty Injured, Some Seriously, Two Dead; Changsha University and Middle School Joint Association Petitions the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 16th] Yueyang primary and secondary school students held a memorial service for the April 1st Massacre on the 13th. Beforehand, Wang Jianbo, the special commissioner of the First District, had instructed them not to hold a march, fearing that there were too many troops stationed there and it would cause trouble. However, the middle school students at the meeting still decided to march, entering the urban area from Yueyang Tower. The order was good at the time when passing through Nan Zheng Street, Pioneer Road, and the railway side. Unexpectedly, a conflict suddenly broke out at Mei Creek Bridge with scattered passing troops stationed there. More than twenty students from Hubin, Senior Agricultural School, and Yue County United Middle School were injured, some seriously. Six were missing, and two were dead, including one teacher. Afterwards, due to the blockade of Yueyang's external mail and telegrams, it was only now that a Hunan University student came to Changsha to announce it. The provincial government has sent personnel to investigate thoroughly.</p>

Chairman Cheng stated that demands (1) and (3) would be fully granted, but point (2) still needed to be investigated, as Wang was still in Changsha on the 12th.</p>

<h3>In Response to the Atlantic Pact, Eastern Europe Completes a Grand Alliance Aimed at Preventing Aggression from Germany or Its Allies</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York Broadcast, 16th: Prague Dispatch: The two allied countries of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe have completed a large-scale "military agreement network," integrating all of Eastern Europe with the Soviet Union. When the Czech Republic and Hungary signed a military agreement in Budapest this afternoon, they issued a statement accusing "Western imperialist countries of concluding the North Atlantic Treaty, intending to revive fascist Germany and threaten world peace." The Czech-Hungarian agreement was signed by Czechoslovakia's Česlav Cipotek and Hungarian Prime Minister Dobi. According to reports, the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries have separately concluded such agreements, and Eastern European countries have also mutually concluded such agreements. The Czech-Hungarian agreement is the twenty-first of such agreements. From now on, the Soviet Union, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia have all concluded bilateral agreements, forming a whole. If Yugoslavia's Tito can abide by his promises, then in the future, if any of the seven countries in the Eastern bloc believe that they have been "threatened" by Germany or a "country directly or indirectly allied with Germany," they will all take unified action to resist it.</p>
<p>[United Press, Budapest, 15th] The Communist Youth Daily criticized "American capitalists" on the 15th for obstructing the task entrusted to Tito by the "People's Republic." Hungarian Communist Party editor Li Weiae wrote in the newspaper that Tito and his group "have become subordinates of American imperialists, in the same position as Bevin, Blum, Gasperi, Mintzenty, and de Gaulle." He stated, "The current task entrusted to Tito by the United States is to obstruct the people's democratic countries, especially Bulgaria, Albania, and Hungary. The Tito regime is actually an informal fellow traveler of the North Atlantic Treaty."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Budapest, 16th] Hungary and Czechoslovakia signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance here this morning. This treaty is practically similar to all the treaties signed earlier between the democratic countries of Eastern Europe. The main purpose is to prevent German aggression. However, the treaty also recalls that the relationship between Hungary and Czechoslovakia in the past was very tense, and now the two governments must work hard to change it into one of mutual reliance and friendship. The treaty also declares that the two countries must take all appropriate measures to prevent an attack on the two countries by Germany or its allies. If one of the contracting parties goes to war with Germany or its allies, the other party must provide military or other assistance with all the resources at its disposal. Neither contracting party may make any alliance against the other party or participate in any actions against the other contracting party with other countries. The contracting parties shall fulfill actions to maintain peace that are consistent with the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Kolarov Succeeds as Bulgarian Prime Minister; Two Romanian Deputy Prime Ministers Dismissed; Ms. Pauker and Loka Fill the Vacancies</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Sofia Radio announced today that Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kolarov has been appointed Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers (i.e., Prime Minister). Kolarov is one of the leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party. In past Bulgarian official documents, he has been referred to as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Deputy Prime Minister). Another Deputy Prime Minister, Kostov, was recently dismissed for "committing serious political and anti-party errors." A U.S. State Department spokesman said today that he believes Dimitrov's trip to the Soviet Union means that he has broken away from government and party affairs. This move may also reveal some new background to the recent purge of Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Kostov and other Bulgarian Communist Party members.</p>
<p>According to reports, Kolarov was elected Chairman of the Bulgarian National Assembly in December 1945. In September 1946, he took over as the temporary President of the Bulgarian Republic. In November of the same year, he was re-elected Chairman of the Bulgarian Republic Presidium and was immediately entrusted with forming a cabinet by Dimitrov. In December 1947, he nominated Georgiev as Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Soon after, Naichev succeeded him as Chairman of the Bulgarian National Assembly.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bucharest, 16th] Romania replaced two of its three deputy prime ministers on the 16th, awarding one of the positions to Communist Party giant Ms. Pauker. Ms. Pauker, who was trained in Moscow and has been regarded as one of the most important Communist Party members in the Balkans, has now been promoted one level in the Romanian government's line of succession. The Presidium of the Romanian People's Republic appointed Ms. Pauker to succeed Agriculture Minister Savulescu as Second Deputy Prime Minister, and appointed the Minister of Finance to succeed Culture Minister Voitec as Third Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Ms. Pauker has been influential in guiding Romanian affairs since returning to Romania with the Soviet army in 1944, but she did not join the government until she was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs on November 7, 1947. A few months later, King Michael fled the country, and Romania became a People's Republic. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party merged to form the New Workers' Party. She is expected to retain her position as Minister of Foreign Affairs in her new position as Second Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] The internal crisis caused by the Stalin-Tito dispute is today focused on the withdrawal of the old Bolshevik revolutionary Dimitrov from the Bulgarian political scene. Dimitrov was originally Prime Minister and Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party. This trip to the Soviet Union for a "return home vacation" is actually the most recent of several actions in the dispute between Soviet satellite countries. These satellite countries have been greatly troubled by the ideological conflict between Stalin and Tito. There is no evidence to be found as to the motives for the further changes of key figures in Eastern European countries, and perhaps it will not be known what their intentions are until weeks or even months later. However, it is generally known that infighting within Bulgaria has always been unceasing since the deterioration of relations between Stalin and Tito. The Bulgarian Communist Party has had great difficulty in discussing a policy to deal with Tito because there are many factions within the party vying for personal power and ideological principles. Kostov, although known for his moderate handling of his country's communist theories, once led the attack on people who supported Tito. Dimitrov has not publicly mentioned Kostov since Kostov's disgrace was announced by the party, which may provide a clue to recent developments.</p>
<h3>Smith Talks About Stalin, Believing That He Is Physically Robust and Seems to Be in Good Health</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 16th] Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith said on the 16th that Soviet Premier Stalin is not as frequently ill as the newspapers have reported. Smith replied to a radio interviewer's question, saying: I don't think Stalin is seriously ill. He is extremely physically robust and seems to be in good health now. People from the Caucasus usually have very long lives.</p>
<h3>Bevin Returns to England Carrying Confidential Documents</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Southampton, 15th] Foreign Minister Bevin arrived here from the United States today aboard the "Mauretania" liner, carrying several confidential and important documents hidden in steel boxes. They were transported by special plane from Washington to here and were to be opened by Bevin immediately after arriving in England. However, because the key to the steel box was not brought with the plane, Bevin summoned the ship's engineer to break the steel box and take out the documents.</p>
<p>[United Press, Southampton, 15th] Foreign Minister Bevin said today upon arriving here that he "still firmly believes that the Atlantic Pact is the most significant step taken in maintaining post-war peace." He continued, "But it will still take considerable time to resolve many world problems."</p>
<h3>The United States, Britain, and France Will Thoroughly Study the Future Status of West Germany; Opportunities for a Four-Power Agreement Are Still Not Abandoned</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The future status of West Germany will be one of the main topics discussed by the leaders of Britain, the United States, and France in Berlin and the capitals of the three countries during the Easter holidays. For a week, the three foreign ministers have successively resolved the three thorny issues of the West German occupation regulations, the establishment of the West German government, the administrative agencies of the three zones, and the dismantling of West German factories. However, the publication of these three agreements has raised two other issues.</p>
<p>First, the dispute between the German Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party over West Germany's basic laws and constitution. Reliable sources say that the Social Democratic Party's refusal to modify the West German draft constitution according to the occupying powers' opinions is not enough to show its final attitude. It is generally believed that the Social Democratic Party will eventually succumb to Allied pressure and abandon the draft constitution it proposed itself when it meets in Gozburg next Wednesday. However, these developments will inevitably leave unpleasant traces on future cooperation between German political parties and the Allied powers. Another major issue is the Soviet Union's attitude and the future status of Berlin caused by the announcement of the West German agreement. There have been widespread rumors in recent days that the Soviet Union has begun to explore the possibility of lifting the Berlin blockade and convening a four-power foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the entire German issue. British officials have denied that the Soviet government has made such overtures to Britain, but it is not yet known whether the Soviet Union has made overtures to the United States and France. U.S. Military Governor of Germany Clay said that there is no evidence to prove that the Berlin blockade can be lifted. However, when Secretary of State Acheson was asked about this matter, he only gave a vague answer. The official opinion of the Western countries is that the establishment of the West German government, the merger of the three zones of West Germany, and other reforms do not prevent the possibility of reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union in the end, but it is also admitted that it will be more difficult to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union after the West German government takes power. Therefore, the weeks before the West German government is established are also the last opportunity to reach a four-power agreement. If this opportunity is not seized, the Berlin problem will continue to exist.</p>
<h3>In Order to Win Over the German People, the Soviet Union May Order Poland to Return German Territory; Belgium Temporarily Suspends Receiving German Border Territory</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 16th] Western diplomatic circles have received news that the Soviet Union may order Poland to return part of Lower Silesia to Germany. Western officials said that this move attempts to rebuild some of the prestige lost by the Soviet Union and the Communist Party in Germany. If this plan is realized, Poland will return part of the industrial area of Lower Silesia to Germany.</p>
<p>[United Press, Brussels, 15th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced tonight that Belgium is temporarily suspending the reception of German borderland that the Western occupying countries recently stipulated should be ceded. This cession totals 52 square miles and is all on the West German border.</p>
<h3>Formally Breaks Away from British Imperial Rule: South Ireland Declares Itself a Republic; Northern Ireland's Border Is Heavily Guarded to Prevent Unrest</h3>
<p>[United Press, Dublin, 16th] South Ireland officially became a free republic today, the final step in 780 years of opposition to British imperial rule. The republic's founding ceremony will be held in front of the General Post Office building, where the Easter Revolution's bloody tragedy occurred 33 years ago, also with the aim of seeking independence.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Belfast, 15th] The Northern Ireland government has ordered strict security measures to be taken over the weekend to prevent possible unrest, paying particular attention to the entry of Irish Republican Army personnel into Northern Ireland. On Monday, the day of the transfer of power, the Irish Anti-Partition League plans to hold demonstrations demanding Irish unity at the border between Northern and Southern Ireland. The Northern Ireland authorities will intensify patrols along the border at that time.</p>
<h3>The UN General Assembly Meeting Still Requires Four Weeks; Israel's Admission to the UN Can Only Be Realized in September</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York Broadcast, 16th: Lake Success Dispatch: The issue of Israel's admission to the United Nations may be postponed until the regular session of the UN General Assembly in mid-September before it is approved. The UN General Assembly decided to submit Israel's application for membership to the Political Committee for discussion, mainly because most representatives obviously wanted to force Israel to make concessions on the internationalization of the Holy Land and the Arab refugee issue. The Holy Land Mediation Committee's report on these two issues will have to be delayed until September before it can be submitted. The Arab representatives will probably argue that Israel's admission to the UN should not wait until those two issues have been resolved before it is approved. It is expected that the meeting will continue for at least four more weeks. In addition to discussing the issue of Israel's admission to the UN, it will also discuss the issue of the disposal of former Italian colonies, the issue of the treatment of Indian residents in South Africa, and the issue of the Franco regime in Spain.</p>

<h3>Peace Conference Representatives: France Restricts Entry; The French Women's Association Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] The French Women's Association today opposed the French government's restriction on the issuance of entry passports to representatives of certain foreign countries, especially the Soviet Union and China, who will participate in the World Peace Congress to be held in Paris on April 20. The Preparatory Committee of the World Peace Congress issued a statement today, stating that the National Office of the French Women's Association is making every effort to oppose the French government's move, saying that this arbitrary plan proves that the French government is hostile to the Soviet Union and the people of the people's democratic countries and China. The French government is attempting to prevent the people of these countries from expressing their desire for peace, so it has now asked the French government to allow the representatives of these countries to enter France. Other French leftist organizations also oppose the French government's restriction on the issuance of entry passports to the representatives.</p>
<h3>The Japanese House of Representatives Passes the Two Trillion Yen Budget; It Is Expected That the Plenary Session of the Senate Will Approve It</h3>

The passage of the bill by the Senate is expected to be inevitable. After the bill is passed by the parliament, Japan will have its first balanced budget since the war.</p>
<h3>Iran, Under Soviet Pressure, Plans to Appeal to the Security Council; Article 6 of the Soviet-Iranian Treaty Is Not Applicable</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Washington Broadcast, 16th: The Iranian Embassy recently denied the claim that the 1921 Soviet-Iranian Treaty was signed under duress. The Iranian Embassy stated that the Iranian government only cancelled Article 6 of the treaty, which stipulates that the Soviet Union may send troops to Iran under certain circumstances. The Iranian Embassy stated that Article 105 of the UN Charter stipulates that for the purpose of enabling UN agencies to carry out their missions, member states should provide the agencies with various necessary privileges. Therefore, Article 6 of the Soviet-Iranian Treaty is no longer applicable.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 15th] It was learned here today that Iran has notified the Soviet Union, stating that if the Soviet Union does not ease its pressure on Iran, Iran will appeal to the UN Security Council. Reliable sources say that Iran has asked the Soviet ambassador, who left for Moscow this morning, to inform the Soviet government of this.</p>
<h3>The Communist Information Bureau Releases a List of "Aggressors"; President Truman Is at the Top of the List</h3>
<p>[United Press, Romanian Capital, 15th] The current issue of the Cominform bulletin lists many Western leaders as possible aggressors. Those at the top of the list are U.S. President Truman, Pope Pius XII, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, former British Prime Minister Churchill, Spanish Head of State Franco, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, French Foreign Minister Schuman, Italian Prime Minister Gasperi, and German Social Democratic Party President Schumacher.

<h3>Warren William Dies of Heart Disease</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hollywood, 16th] Veteran actor Warren William died of heart disease late yesterday, at the age of 63.</p>
<h3>European Socialization of Medicine Movement</h3>
<p>The cost of medical care is so high that it is beyond the means of ordinary people. Most European countries have adopted a system of free consultation at hospitals and doctors' offices, with all expenses covered by the state.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 16th] Doctors in Europe have been gradually trending towards socialization in the past twenty years. Public and private health insurance plans are very common, and an increasing number of doctors are participating in organized social services. However, in terms of the scale of such plans, no country except the Soviet Union can compete with the United Kingdom. In the UK, everyone can receive free treatment. There are three main reasons for the medical socialization movement: the people's hope for social and economic security promotes the universality of treatment; the advancement of medicine over the past fifty years has resulted in sophisticated equipment and high costs, which are beyond the means of ordinary people; and after the war, Europe lacked doctors and medicines, and the distribution was uneven in many countries, especially in rural agricultural countries.</p>
<p>Some health plans are compulsory, while others are limited to specific salaried classes. Many countries adopted forms of medical socialization as early as the mid-19th century, with their protection plans originating from labor unions. Compulsory plans organized by the government are largely the product of post-war political thought, especially in Eastern European countries. In 1948, the United Kingdom implemented a national health service. Initially, the 1911 National Insurance Act only stipulated that funding would come from tax revenue. Only those with an income of less than $1,680 were eligible for insurance, preventing diseases, accounting for about half of the national population.</p>
<p>According to a United Press survey of fifteen European countries, the general situation of medical socialization is as follows:</p>
<p>Norway—Employees with an income of less than 9,000 Norwegian kroner per year are required by law to participate in health insurance, accounting for about 80% of the total population. Employers pay one-sixth of the insurance premium on their behalf, and the rest is borne by the employee. Those with higher incomes can choose whether to participate in insurance. Patients are free to choose a doctor, and consultation fees are used under the insurance plan, with the cost of medicine paid out-of-pocket. Regulations also stipulate doctor's consultation fees: 5 Norwegian kroner for the initial consultation and 4 kroner for each follow-up visit. Specialist consultation fees are 10 kroner.</p>
<p>Sweden—The government is scheduled to implement a compulsory health insurance law from July 1, 1950, with funding from official appropriations or special taxes. The parliament is currently reviewing a comprehensive health plan that stipulates that all doctors in the country should be employed by the government for a period of about ten years. There are a total of 651 hospitals in Sweden, of which only 13 are privately owned. Medical treatment is completely free for the poor, and partially free for other patients.</p>
<p>Denmark—Since 1932, people over the age of 17 have been required to have insurance, paying 75 Danish kroner per year until their income reaches the government's prescribed limit. During this period, they can choose their own doctor and change it once a year. Insurance costs are waived. Most hospitals are managed by the central or local government.</p>
<p>Poland—Medical socialization began in 1945. Doctors are responsible for treating workers in state-owned enterprises for at least five hours a day, receiving a monthly salary of 30,000 Polish złoty from the Ministry of Health. They can practice privately after completing their public duties. Poland currently has 8,000 physicians and surgeons, compared to 14,500 before the war. The total population of the country is about 24 million.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia—Since July 1948, 95% of the national population has participated in health insurance and received free medical treatment. Workers pay about 3% of their wages for insurance, while shop assistants pay 4% to 5%. The deficit is subsidized by the national treasury, and all hospitals are state-owned.</p>
<p>Hungary—Handicraft workers have been required to have insurance since 1927, with the insured person paying 1% of medical expenses and the employer paying 12%. Doctors' salaries are limited, but they work very hard. The government is now planning to expand the compulsory insurance system to the entire population.</p>
<p>Bulgaria—Since the government implemented a state-run health plan, the medical services received by the people have greatly improved compared to the past private doctors.</p>
<p>Romania—Since January 1, 1949, 1.5 million members of various trade unions and their families, totaling about 4 million people, can receive free medical treatment, but 85% of Romania's total population are farmers, and farmers are not yet included in the scope of the health insurance law.</p>
<p>Germany—After Prime Minister Bismarck proposed the social insurance law in 1879, compulsory health insurance was implemented. Until 1945, all workers with a monthly salary of less than 300 marks participated. This plan is largely implemented throughout West Germany, but there have been slight changes in Berlin, with medicine costs waived and each outpatient visit costing 5 marks. Patients can receive X-rays for a limited number of times during a certain period.</p>
<p>Soviet Union—All medicine is socialized. People can freely seek medical treatment an unlimited number of times, whether at home or in the hospital. Doctors' salaries and hospital operating expenses are all provided by the state. The total budget for 1948 stipulated health expenditures of over 20 billion rubles, which, according to official prices, is about 4 billion US dollars.</p>
<p>France—Those with a monthly salary of less than 19,000 French francs pay 6% of the insurance premium, and the employer pays 4%. Excellent doctors can enjoy the same medical treatment as hospitals and department heads. They should attend to patients in the hospital every morning, and the consultation fee is determined by the hospital based on the patient's income. They can take on private business at other times.</p>
<p>Italy—The most important state-run medical organization is funded by employer donations, accounting for 5% of each worker's monthly salary. Workers do not pay, but they and their families can be hospitalized for 180 days each year. Doctors in the hospital each manage 2,000 to 4,000 patients. Whether they treat patients or not, the hospital pays each doctor 270 to 340 lire per patient, which is about 47 to 60 US cents, based on the number of patients.</p>
<p>Spain—Since 1942, about 16 million people have enjoyed free medical treatment benefits under the health insurance plan, including employees with a monthly salary of less than 1,000 Spanish pesetas and their families. The plan is managed by the Ministry of Labor. Employees pay 6% of their monthly salary for insurance, and the employer pays the same amount, with the rest being subsidized by the government.</p>
<p>Portugal—State-run or municipal hospitals waive all or part of medical expenses based on the patient's income. Large factories hire their own doctors to provide free medical treatment to workers. Last year, the government paid a total of 28,988,800 Portuguese escudos to supplement the insufficient funds of various hospitals, equivalent to 2,174,100 US dollars.</p>
<p>Belgium—There is no socialization plan yet, but 1.9 million workers are registered under the social security law to participate in disease prevention insurance. Treatment costs are borne by the individual, and a portion may be reimbursed afterward depending on the situation.</p>

<h3>Secretary-General Chen of the Municipal Government Holds a Talk Session; Decision on Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices Expected Tomorrow; Source of Rice and Fuel Guaranteed Without Worry</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Liang, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, invited responsible persons from various newspapers in the city to a discussion at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3 PM yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Pan Gongzhan and Cheng Cangbo. Secretary-General Chen first delivered a speech, stating: (1) The most important issue facing Shanghai today is the price problem. Regarding how to suppress and stabilize prices, I exchanged opinions with Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun on the evening of the 15th. Minister Liu went to Beijing on the evening of the 16th to discuss effective countermeasures with the Central Government regarding the current financial and monetary control measures. A concrete decision will be made after he returns to Shanghai tomorrow (the 18th). (2) Preparations are underway to stabilize rice prices through public funds, and the source of rice can be guaranteed without worry. Recently, the municipal authorities have reached a general agreement with the Economic Cooperation Administration, and have ordered 45,000 tons from overseas. On the domestic front, it is planned to purchase another 600,000 shi. From July onwards, the ECA will continue to supply rationed rice, and the issue of rice sources has been resolved. (3) Regarding fuel, the issue of flour exchange for coal should be resolved within half a month. Taiwan exports 70,000 tons of coal per month to supply South China and the Beijing-Shanghai area. Fuel should not become a problem. Imported coal purchased within two months will be exempt from taxes. (4) Regarding how to maintain industry and commerce, the municipal authorities have successively established a Factory Raw Material and Finished Product Purchasing and Sales Design Committee and a North-South Material Exchange Design Committee to solve the difficulties of industry and commerce, and have appointed the Industry Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as design committee members. This move will greatly help the smooth flow of materials in this city. (5) Regarding the student movement, the government has decided to take guidance and persuasion as the principle, adhering to the aim of caring for students and safeguarding education, and providing guidance day and night, and instructing the military and police to only maintain order and generally not retaliate. (6) The municipal finances and economy are tight. Due to currency depreciation, some taxes are not timely and the income is almost zero. The municipal government's income and expenditure are far apart, and it is determined to strive for gradual improvement. Subsequently, the responsible persons of various newspapers successively expressed their opinions, and the meeting adjourned at about 5 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan Suggests Issuing Local Currency</h3>
<p>At the meeting, Pan Gongzhan and others requested the Central Government to approve the issuance of local currency to alleviate the current economic crisis. Pan stated that the people have lost faith in the gold yuan issued by the Central Bank. If the Ministry of Finance can approve several commercial banks to issue local currency by depositing sufficient reserves, then credit can be better. However, the key lies in whether the Central Bank can allocate the issuance authority to commercial banks. Yan Esheng stated that experts had previously studied the issuance of local currency, which cannot be implemented without the support of the Central Government. As for reserves, the Central Bank has already exchanged all of them when it redeemed gold and silver last time. It may be possible to use materials such as gauze as reserves, and the commercial banks can jointly form a joint reserve committee to manage the reserves and manage the issuance. Secretary-General Chen expressed great approval of the above suggestions, stating that after Minister Liu returns to Shanghai on Monday, he will convene responsible persons from local governments and various legal entities to discuss the central government's economic decisions brought back this time, and will propose them, and hope that the Senate will invite leaders from all walks of life to jointly discuss this issue.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Freight Insurance Squad Established Yesterday; Highest Insurance Premium Charged is 4%</h3>
<p>The Property Insurance Department of the Central Trust Bureau started providing Yangtze River freight war risk insurance yesterday, which is denominated in foreign currency. However, this foreign currency insurance method is limited to export materials. However, because foreign currency is still prohibited from free trading, all are settled with foreign exchange transfer certificates. The rate for the payment of insurance premiums was announced by the department yesterday as follows: (1) The entire Yangtze River route, from Chongqing to Shanghai, charges 4% of the insured amount. (2) The upper reaches of the Yangtze River, from Chongqing to Wanxian, charge 0.5% of the insured amount. (3) The middle reaches of the Yangtze River, from Wanxian to Hankou, charge 2% of the insured amount. (4) The lower reaches of the Yangtze River, from Hankou to Shanghai, charge 4% of the insured amount. According to the person in charge of the department, in light of the recent ceasefire talks, cargo ships that were stranded near Jiujiang a few days ago will continue to arrive in Shanghai for export, most of which are tung oil, lard, and other materials. Therefore, it is said that there will be more people applying for war risk insurance recently.</p>
<h3>Air Freight Rates Adjusted Today; Increase of 470%</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Air freight rates will be adjusted from today, with the announced increase rate being 470%, adjusted from the original price of 1,048 gold yuan per passenger kilometer to 5,970 yuan. This adjustment is calculated based on the average increase rate in flight costs. Since the last adjustment on the 3rd of this month, aviation gasoline has increased from 16,510 yuan to 103,900 yuan per gallon, an increase of 528%. The US dollar exchange rate has increased from 18,500 yuan to 92,000 yuan, an increase of 497%. The cost of living index has increased from 3,402 times to 15,140 times, an increase of 345%.

<h3>Water and Land Public Transportation Ticket Prices Adjusted Today</h3>
<p>Various water and land public transportation companies in this city have experienced an excessive increase in prices recently, especially the prices of gasoline, coal, and foreign exchange, which are the main costs, have soared wildly. The ticket revenue is too far from the actual expenditure, and they are all on the verge of being unable to maintain operations. They have successively submitted requests to the competent authorities to re-adjust the new prices according to the mid-month index to alleviate the emergency. Yesterday, the Public Works Bureau invited representatives from the Senate to jointly review and confirm that this was indeed the case, and it was approved by the Municipal Government and implemented today (the 17th). After this adjustment, the public bus fares are 1,500, 2,300, 3,000, 3,500, and 4,000 yuan. Tram first class is 1,500, 2,100, 2,600, 3,200, and 3,600 yuan. Third class is 1,000, 1,400, 1,700, 2,100, and 2,400 yuan. Ferry is 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The soaring prices of gasoline, coal, and foreign exchange have greatly affected the expenditures of various public transportation companies. According to statistics from the Municipal Public Transportation Company, the average daily ticket revenue from April 1 to 15 was approximately 85 million yuan. Only the expenditure on gasoline alone, based on the total ticket revenue, requires a loss of more than 10%. According to statistics from British and French companies, the losses in March were as high as 3 billion yuan due to price increases. In addition, the number of passengers without tickets has increased sharply recently, accounting for more than 53% of all passengers. The various companies have successively submitted requests to the competent authorities to seek effective solutions to maintain their survival.</p>
<h3>Business Tax for Both Seasons Has Been Collected</h3>
<p>The simplified collection of business tax for various industries in this city for the winter of last year and the spring of this year, after the Municipal Business Tax Simplified Collection Review Committee referred to the actual situation of various industries to review and determine the tax base, and after the various district collection offices under the city actively collected the tax, has been fully collected. A very small number of those who have not paid beyond the deadline will be fined separately in accordance with the regulations on fines.</p>
<h3>Industry Association and Chamber of Commerce Write to the Central Bank to Quickly Order Coal Exchange Contracts</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Industrial Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce jointly wrote to the Central Bank yesterday, requesting that it quickly sign a contract with Kailuan Coal Mine for 50,000 tons of coal exchange to alleviate the city's severe coal shortage.</p>
<h3>Chen Daqing Hosts Reporters to Discuss Economic and Security Issues</h3>
<p>Security Forces Organized by Some Schools Should be Banned · ID Cards from Areas North of the Yangtze River are Invalid</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Songhu Garrison Commander Chen Daqing hosted reporters in the conference room of the headquarters at 10:00 AM yesterday, and made the following remarks on the city's economic and security issues: (1) The city's economic situation has been extremely serious recently. Prices have been jumping several times a day. The lives of citizens are on the verge of desperation, and social security has been greatly affected. Commander-in-Chief Tang and Minister Liu Gongyun have exchanged views on economic issues many times, and will immediately convene an emergency meeting to discuss ways to curb the runaway prices after Minister Liu returns to Shanghai. Positive efforts will be made to secure sources of key materials such as rice and coal, and illegal activities such as speculation, manipulation, and monopoly will be strictly prohibited. In particular, the recent surge in silver dollars and the speculators who are stirring up trouble in the market, and there are also people manipulating behind the scenes, are currently under strict investigation and will be completely banned. (2) Recently, some students from several schools have been engaged in illegal activities on campus after their off-campus parades and other activities were banned, such as organizing security forces, some of whom even use weapons and build fortifications. This kind of action is indeed childish and ridiculous, and has absolutely no legal basis. If they are doing this for safety, then the garrison command has the responsibility to protect public security, and can send troops to protect them if necessary. Therefore, this kind of activity should be banned and disbanded by the school authorities, otherwise the school will be blockaded or other measures will be taken to maintain public security. (3) The city's population is complex, and general surveys and statistics are not very accurate, resulting in many homicide and theft cases in recent months that are difficult to solve. A decision has been made to rectify this. In addition to the fixed households residing in the urban area being thoroughly investigated by the municipal government, for the floating population, the Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters will propose to the central government that all passengers on ships, vehicles, and airplanes must purchase tickets with their ID cards, and after arriving at their destinations, they must also stay in hotels with their ID cards. ID cards from all areas north of the Yangtze River will be invalid from now on. (4) Regarding the release of political prisoners, the department has not yet received a formal order. Chen believes that everything should still depend on how the peace talks progress. If the peace talks are successful, there is no need to detain them any longer. During the current peace talks, this is not an urgent issue to be resolved.</p>
<h3>The Rumor That Chen Daqing and Shi Jue Would be Swapped Has Become a Thing of the Past</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Daqing will continue to serve as the Songhu Garrison Commander, and the rumor that Chen would be swapped with Shi Jue, the deputy commander of the Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, has become a thing of the past. This is because the authorities, in view of the complex situation in this city, intend to divide public security work from military defense. In the future, Commander Chen will be solely responsible for social security. Shi Jue will be ordered to take charge of military defense in the Zhejiang-Shanghai area.</p>
<h3>Consultations Among Authorities; Decisive Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In recent days, the general prices in this city have once again risen wildly and in a straight line. Especially after the release of the mid-month cost of living index, almost every commodity has risen by 50% to 100% daily. The lives of ordinary citizens have been forced to the brink of survival. According to reliable sources: The city's security authorities have decided to consult with the financial authorities on emergency measures starting next week. It is said that these measures may be similar to the policies implemented during the currency reform last autumn, and their implementation will inevitably deal the most severe blow to various speculative markets, in order to wipe out this surging and unextinguished price inflation in one fell swoop. These decisive measures could have been implemented immediately, but because Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun has gone to Beijing, the outcome will be seen as soon as Liu returns to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Director of the National Bank's Business Bureau, Du Chongyong, to Resign Again</h3>

<h3>Haihang Ship Arrives in Shanghai from Shantou; Passengers Caught Smuggling Opium</h3>

<h3>Gold Control Bureau Divided into Six Groups for Inspection; Responsibility for Deducting Wages Paid in Cash</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Central Bank issued more than 30 billion yuan in cash to various banks and financial institutions on the 15th for distribution to factories to pay employees' wages. However, some factories did not receive the money on that day, and disputes arose among employees demanding payment, leading some to suspect that the banks and financial institutions were diverting these funds for speculation. Secretary-General Chen of the municipal government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate thoroughly. Yesterday, the Gold Control Bureau dispatched personnel in six groups to inspect various banks and financial institutions. The Police Bureau participated in four groups, and the Social Affairs Bureau participated in two groups. According to Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau: This inspection aims to clarify who is responsible for suppressing and diverting the funds. If the factory did not send someone to collect the money, the responsibility lies with the factory. If the factory sent someone to collect the money, but the bank or financial institution deliberately made it difficult to issue the money, the fault lies with the bank or financial institution. After a thorough investigation, the full situation will be announced.</p>
<h3>Cash for Wage Payments at Factories to be Collected by Labor Unions; Banks and Financial Institutions to Deposit Every Other Day; National Bank Issues Half of Cash</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the Central Bank improved the method of issuing cash in order to ensure that cash for wage payments reaches the hands of manufacturers directly. The method was changed to have the industrial unions contact the relevant banks and financial institutions, issue checks from the banks and financial institutions to the Central Bank, and then have the industrial unions endorse them before collecting the cash directly from the cashier's department of the National Bank. The total amount of cash collected by the industrial unions yesterday was 30 billion yuan out of the 70 billion yuan that was agreed upon. The order of the cash collection process was generally good. Occasionally, some factories did not go through the industrial unions to collect cash directly from the National Bank. The National Bank also accommodated and issued cash to them uniformly. However, according to the relevant authorities of the bank, it is hoped that manufacturers will still have the industrial unions collect the remaining 40 billion yuan in cash to be issued on Monday (i.e., tomorrow) in order to save time and procedures and to ensure that the allocated 70 billion yuan in cash can be issued on the 16th and 18th as scheduled. Furthermore, if the industrial unions' cash allocation for the 16th has not been received due to unclear procedures, it can be included in the 18th for collection.</p>
<p>In addition to issuing 30 billion yuan in cash to the industrial unions yesterday, the National Bank also issued 5% (i.e., half) of the cash to each bank and financial institution based on their bi-daily deposit balance to meet the needs of their clients. As for the various state-owned enterprises and institutions that directly interact with the National Bank, the National Bank still issued 30% of the cash based on their balance yesterday. For those without special needs, the bank will still provide appropriate leniency based on the actual situation.</p>
<h3>Financial Industry Issues Statement on the Issue of Issuing New Cash</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Responsible persons from the Banking, Money Exchange, and Trust Association, regarding the report that factories were paying wages and the National Bank was issuing cash that was being used by banks and financial institutions who were failing to keep their promises, resulting in manufacturers not receiving the money, issued a statement on the actual situation, stating: The issue of factories paying wages this period, due to the cash shortage, had been discussed in advance by the relevant agencies more than once. The banking and financial industry is in an intermediary position and naturally wants to consider the needs of manufacturers who are their clients. During the group meeting on the 13th, it was discussed that the checks for wage payments during this period should be endorsed by the industry unions to distinguish them from other clients, so that manufacturers could use them to collect cash. However, this point was not clearly stipulated during the meeting at the Central Bank the next day, and it was suggested that the wage payments during this period should be handled exclusively by designated banks, which would be clearer, but this was not adopted. The Central Bank authorities only stated that 90 billion yuan in cash would be issued within three days starting from the 15th, which is about 30 billion yuan per day. According to the industry's usual deposits in the Central Bank, it is roughly estimated to be around 100 billion yuan. Calculating 30 billion yuan per day, it is only slightly less than 30%, which is not much more than the usual amount of cash collected. Moreover, the deposits of each bank and financial institution in the Central Bank vary, and the clients of the banks and financial institutions are not limited to manufacturers, so they cannot refuse other clients' withdrawals. With procedures not yet finalized and handling inconsistent, how can there be a failure to keep promises? Taking the cash received on the 15th alone, it was only 20%. Excluding the 10% for fixed-amount promissory notes, the cash received by each bank and financial institution must be issued under such a severe cash shortage and cannot be retained. Moreover, the banks and financial institutions do not have the resources to hoard this cash, and the banks have long-standing relationships with manufacturers, knowing their urgent need for cash, so how can there be a reason to deliberately make things difficult for them? This kind of misunderstanding is not factual. Therefore, if the manufacturers who are clients of the banks and financial institutions have any questions, they can only investigate the facts. The allegation that banks and financial institutions are profiting from the cash premium is an illegal act and can only be reported to the Gold Control Bureau for legal action. The true situation is hereby clarified.</p>

<h3>Political Prisoners Held in Custody in Shanghai Prison; Release Changed to Today Due to Insufficient Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The political prisoners held in custody in Shanghai Prison have been notified to their families to proceed with bail. Yesterday, due to insufficient time to complete various procedures, the release was changed to start today. In addition to the appointment of Prosecutors Chen Shoutao and Wang Daoyi to be specifically responsible for handling bail, the District Court has also appointed Court Presidents Zhong Xianda and Zhu Yuhuang to jointly supervise the handling. Chen and the other four are scheduled to go to Shanghai Prison this morning to conduct individual reviews and talks with the political prisoners who will be released soon. Once the bail procedures for each prisoner are completed, they will be released. As for the political prisoners sentenced for the crime of rebellion under ordinary criminal law, it was originally planned to submit the case to the Supreme Court for interpretation before a decision was made. However, fearing that the exchange of letters and telegrams would take time, it is now planned that the two prosecutors and two court presidents in charge of the case will consult and make a decision directly. There are still some political prisoners being held in custody, but the prison did not disclose their exact number yesterday. The District Prosecutor's Office has not yet received a response regarding the political prisoners held in custody from other sources.</p>

<h3>Five First-Catch Yellow Croaker Fishing Boats Entered Port Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The spring fishing season in Wusong has arrived. It is learned that the first-catch yellow croaker fishing boats that entered port yesterday included [names illegible], Jin Changxing, Jin Fashun, and Zhang Jinshun. After completing the reporting procedures, they unloaded their cargo at around 1:00 PM for sale ashore. The fish shops Xie Xinggong, Jicheng, Junta, etc., were responsible for distribution and set the opening price. The wholesale price was agreed to be equivalent to seven dou of white rice per dan. Yesterday's rice price was 660,000 yuan, so calculated at seven dou, each dan was converted to 462,000 yuan in gold yuan notes. The retail price was 500,000 yuan per dan. The daily price in the future will still be based on the rise and fall of the rice market as the standard. The goods that arrived yesterday only met the needs of retail sales. Wholesale by inland Hakka merchants will have to wait for the arrival of large batches of goods. It is reported that due to the closure of the port of Fushan Hupu during this fishing season, the arrival of large numbers of fishing boats in Wusong will be more prosperous than in previous years. Fortress Commander Hu Kexian has ordered the deployment of posts to provide strict protection.</p>

<h3>Battle for the Bridgehead in Northern Jiangsu: Ensuring the Natural Barrier of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent, He Xianglin</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 14th] The flames of war are burning ever closer to the opposite bank of the river. The Yangtze River, known as a natural barrier, is now facing a historic test. Zhenjiang, in these few days, has drawn the keen attention of the people nationwide because it is the shield for Nanjing and Shanghai, and its advance or retreat will have a tremendous impact on the overall situation. From the 6th to the 10th of this month, the sounds of artillery fire across the river have been incessant, shaking the glass windows and objects in the houses.</p>
<p>The Fate of Yizheng</p>
<p>This time, the large-scale offensive launched by the communist forces in northern Jiangsu, in addition to being determined to take Yidun, the only isolated city in Jiangbei, has two meanings: on the one hand, to act as a pioneer for peace talks, to facilitate bargaining; on the other hand, to seize a springboard for crossing the river, directly threatening the safety of Nanjing and Shanghai. After the Nationalist troops successively retreated from Yangzhou, Qin County, and Nantong at the end of last year, the communist forces wanted to seize Yizheng effortlessly. However, the opposite happened. Five or six offensives were launched on Yizheng, but they were unexpectedly driven away by Zuo Zhiren, a young county magistrate who fought hard and refused to surrender. The communist forces were very distressed. Once, they reached the city gate and shouted to the defending soldiers: "Your big city of Yangzhou has been lost. Are you fools still trying to defend this broken pig city?" From that time on, around the beginning of February, Yizheng fell into a fate of being surrounded on three sides with the river on the remaining side. Later, although the communist forces' offensive temporarily stopped, in reality, they knew that this group of local communists could not take Yizheng. So, on the 6th of this month, the 26th Army of the Eighth Corps, led by Zhang Mingchu with three to four thousand men, was suddenly transferred from Lai'an County via Liuhe, equipped with considerable firepower, including fifteen cannons. They spent a night and took the important stronghold of Xupu Bridge in the northwest of the city in one fell swoop. (Note: Xupu Bridge is about five or six li away from Yizheng city, just to the north of the Simangzhou port on the Yangtze River, seven li away. The mountain peaks undulate and the rivers crisscross, making it a stronghold that threatens the river defense.) On the one hand, the vanguard of the communist forces immediately scurried to the stronghold of La Temple in the north of the city. The county security regiment of the defending army fought bravely under the disparity of strength and retreated to defend the north gate of the city.</p>
<p>Zuo Zhiren's Breakthrough</p>
<p>At 8 PM on the evening of the 7th, the communist forces' offensive intensified. The cannons at Xupu Bridge intensively fired more than 200 shells into Yizheng city and the Jiangmian River area of Siyuan River. At about 11 PM, the county government office was hit by a shell and caught fire. The city was filled with thick smoke, and more than 1,000 communist troops attacked the west gate. By the time the defending troops outside the north gate rushed into the city to reinforce, it was too late to stop them. They then engaged in fierce street fighting with the communist forces, with the sound of fighting shaking the sky. County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren immediately led the security team to break through the fire line and retreated to defend the south gate (the gate is four li away from the Jiangmian River area of Siyuan River). Unexpectedly, a part of the communist forces attacked from the west gate and then divided their troops to occupy the defense positions of the defending troops in the Simangzhou area in the southeast of the city, and thus controlled the gunboats on the Jiangmian River area of Siyuan River. County Magistrate Zuo knew that things were not good and immediately broke out of the south gate and tried to travel along the Siyuan River highway. When he reached a place two li away from the Yisi Bridge midway, the bridgehead asked for the password. County Magistrate Zuo still thought that the bridge was guarded by the security team. The person who asked for the password then said: "Wrong." County Magistrate Zuo was captured here. It is said that he has now been escorted to the Yangzhou Military Control Commission by the communist forces.</p>
<p>Nationalist Troops in Liuwei</p>
<p>After the communist forces captured Yizheng, they became arrogant and launched a fierce offensive on the areas of Sanmao River, Sanjiangying, Shijia Bridge, Liuwei, and Shierwei facing Zhenjiang at dawn on the next day. The communist forces fired more than 3,000 shells in this area. Sanmao River, Sanjiangying, and Shijia Bridge were successively captured, but although the Zhang Mingchu's troops who attacked Yizheng launched a fierce attack on Shierwei, they were suppressed and retreated after continuous shelling by our navy, and dared not act rashly again.</p>
<p>The bridgehead position of the defending troops in Liuwei is extremely strong. From the 8th to the 10th, the communist forces formed an arc-shaped battle line from the east, west, and north sides to encircle Liuwei. The vanguard once reached the vicinity of Chenjia Bridge, four li away from Liuwei. On the morning of the 10th, the people of Zhenjiang were all worried about the gain or loss of Liuwei because Liuwei is just opposite Zhenjiang. If it were abandoned, it would have a great impact on Zhenjiang. Fortunately, the defending troops and the navy used intensive artillery fire to bombard the communist forces, and the communist forces began to retreat. Now the situation in Liuwei is very stable, and a large number of Nationalist troops have been reinforced. The Guazhou area is also quite peaceful. The communist forces stranded on the Yun Causeway of Balipu north of Guazhou are really not easy to sneak across.</p>
<p>The Daqiao town and Xinzhou, located on the east bank of Jiangbei at the junction of Zhenjiang and Yangzhou, are the first district under the jurisdiction of Zhenjiang County. The situation is quite dangerous and is a good springboard for the communist forces to sneak across. Unexpectedly, a part of the communist forces in Sanjiangying coordinated with the local communists to launch a large-scale attack on the night of the 7th. After the local teams calmly responded, the communist forces reinforced with four regiments of troops or more to launch a fierce attack on the night of the 10th. Due to the disparity in strength, the local teams took the initiative to retreat to Dagang. At dawn on the 13th, the Dagang defending troops counterattacked after reinforcements and recovered Gaoqiao Xinzhou in one fell swoop, and captured more than 1,000 communist troops. The communist forces on all fronts had to retreat to the north.</p>
<p>The Delusion of Crossing the River</p>
<p>In summary, the battle for the bridgehead in northern Jiangsu can be said to be a fierce and valuable battle. According to unofficial statistics: the communist forces suffered more than 20,000 casualties this time, with considerable losses. It gave the communist forces' delusion of crossing the river a serious lesson. It is said that a certain political commissar of the CCP in northern Jiangsu made a judgment on the Nationalist troops after the end of the Huaihai Campaign: (1) retreating to defend northern Jiangsu and consolidating the river with the entire division is the best strategy; (2) adding more heavy troops and mobilizing the air force to completely sweep the Binjiang area is the middle strategy; (3) guarding the current strongholds, not advancing or retreating, and waiting for the main force of the communist forces to come south to offset the strength, and exchanging space for time is the worst strategy. However, this time, the Nationalist troops' battle to defend the Jiangbei bridgehead exceptionally strove for the first.</p>
<p>According to the military authorities here, this offensive by the communist forces in northern Jiangsu was a planned action. Although Yizheng, Siyuangou, Sanmaohe, Shijiaqiao and other places were captured, the Nationalist army has close coordination and prevention by the army, navy and air force, so it is still impossible for the communist army to cross the river. We must always be vigilant, defend the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, and ensure the fortress of peace.</p>
<h3>·Reward of 50,000 Silver Dollars· For the Capture of Jia Yibin</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Xing, 15th] After a part of the officers and soldiers of the Hebei Pre-Cadre Regiment mutinied, they were jointly suppressed by the security team of the First District and the Jiangsu Security Team. Most of them have voluntarily surrendered their weapons and sent back to their original posts. There are still more than 80 remnants led by Jia Yibin who fled back to the upper reaches. Chairman Zhou of Zhejiang Province has offered a reward of 50,000 silver dollars for the capture of Jia Yibin. The commissioner has ordered assistance in the arrest to bring him to justice in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Lanzhou Industry Faces Crisis: Issuing Loans · Freezing Silver Dollar Storage</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent, Song Lin</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Lanzhou, 10th] Lanzhou's industry is facing a crisis. Dozens of small factories that cannot overcome the difficulties have closed down one after another. Financial figures held several symposiums some time ago, brewing the organization of an industrial loan banking group, responsible for industrial loans, and put forward a specific plan to lend 50,000 silver coins to large and small factories to continue production and prosper the economy in the Northwest. In addition, there is also a request to resolve the silver dollars stored in the Central Bank and lend them to the private factories in need of relief first. However, these good prescriptions for resolving the Northwest industrial crisis are still hovering in legal procedures. We only hear the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but we don't see anyone coming down.</p>
<p>When the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee will be established is nowhere in sight, and formal lending is even more unpredictable. Many small manufacturers who were lured by this series of beautiful dreams to "drink poison to quench their thirst" are unwilling to lose money to maintain production, and are planning to close down their factories one after another. Recently, members of various trade unions have been crowding in the small building of the Industrial Association all day long, sighing and sighing, unable to think of any way to persuade the small factory owners who are about to close their doors to endure for a period of time, wait for the ideal fruit to mature, and then reorganize and continue to work.</p>
<p>Among the factories in Lanzhou, except for the provincial leather factory, chemical factory, cement factory, machine factory, electrical appliance factory, and the private Northwest Wool Textile Factory, Lanzhou Woolen Mill, and several large flour mills, the situation is better. The remaining 226 small factories, one-third of them are preparing to close down recently. The most serious are the 82 brick and tile factories, none of which maintain regular production. The 18 soap factories, 30 textile factories, and 9 tannery factories are all overwhelmed. The remaining 9 small flour mills, 39 printing factories, 8 metal processing factories, and 2 match factories are also in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>A person in charge of the Industrial Association told reporters: "If one-third of the 226 factories close down, more than 2,000 workers will be unemployed. Not to mention how the unemployed workers will solve their future lives, just imagine how much impact this group of people crowding on the streets will have on society?"</p>
<p>"Then," the reporter asked him, "what measures will the Industrial Association take to save this crisis?" He responded with a helpless bitter smile.</p>
<h3>Rain in Anxi County</h3>
<p>The car bypassed Chijinbao and continued to climb up the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway at the 838-kilometer mark. The rain was getting heavier and heavier, but it was only about 2 PM when we reached the county seat of Yumen. We decided to rush on in the rain and pass through more than 200 kilometers of the Gobi Desert at a very fast speed.</p>
<p>On this section of the road, we unexpectedly enjoyed the rain scene in the Gobi Desert. Except for the Mogongtan area in Anxi County, which is a green grass lake, with large patches of light red, light purple, and pink-white wildflowers blooming on the shallow grass, happily receiving the raindrops, the rest of the area is almost entirely sandy gravel covered with camel thorns. The construction of this section of the road is extremely easy. Just measure the direction, dig two ditches in the Gobi Desert, and pave some gravel between the two ditches, and you can drive smoothly. Therefore, this section of the road is extremely straight. Later, the rain became heavier and heavier, and the low-lying areas of the road surface accumulated into pools of water, but the car was still able to cross the water without hesitation.</p>
<p>The Qilian Mountains to the south of the road and the Mazong Mountains to the north of the road gradually disappeared from our sight, and the impact was vague and unclear. The horizon seen at the end of the eye is dome-shaped, and only the road in front of us extends to the intersection point and almost connects with the sky.</p>
<p>The car passed Qiaowan Town. There is a road here that extends to Gongpoquan, a major town in the Mazong Mountains. Although there is no passenger or freight transport, the Seventh District Road Administration still runs a car once a week for maintenance. There is also a story of a human skin drum here: According to legend, Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty once dreamed at night in the desert, saw nine trees and a bridge, and an old man under the bridge told him the place name of Qiaowan Town, and suggested that Kangxi build a castle here that was similar in size to the Beijing city circle, which would be beneficial to the Qing Dynasty. Kangxi woke up and ordered people to visit this town in various places. Later, it was found that Anxi had this place name, and there were nine trees, just as seen in the dream. He then ordered his nephew, the Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu, Cha, to supervise the construction of the castle here, just like the Beijing system. Cha saw that this place was desolate and did not care much, so he casually supervised the construction of a small castle to perfunctorily complete the task, embezzling a lot of public funds. Later, after being reported, Kangxi was furious and issued an edict to strip Cha of his skin and use it to make a drum, and use his skull and other things to make wine vessels and sacrificial utensils to warn against corruption. The highway does not pass through the castle, and it is said that the human skin drum and skull are now stored in the Anxi Folk Education Museum, so the car did not stop. Everyone in the car talked about the punishment of skinning. Although it was too cruel, Kangxi's determination to punish corruption was still talked about by the people. It can be seen that the people, after suffering hundreds of years of brutal political oppression from the Qing Dynasty, would also create this kind of story to vent their feelings.</p>
<p>Going further ahead is Bulongji. It used to be a densely populated and commercially prosperous big city. It is said that there were five or six thousand residents, but now it has become a deserted city. Most of the city has been engulfed by the desert and has become an area where wolves roam.</p>
<p>At about 7 PM, we arrived in Anxi in torrential rain. Anxi is the center of the three counties outside the pass. In addition to the highway to Lanzhou, it can go northwest to Xingxingxia, drive straight to northern Xinjiang, and go west to Dunhuang, out of Yumenguan, to southern Xinjiang, and southwest over Yangguan, to Qinghai, and is an important town in the Western Regions. The "wind" in Anxi is constant throughout the year, especially in winter and spring. Flying sand and rocks are commonplace. Together with the "heat" of Turpan and the "cold" of Zhenxi, they are called the three wonders outside the pass. The famous "ancient Shazhou" is in the southwest of Anxi, and is now gradually being buried by flying sand.</p>
<p>That night, we stayed overnight in the county self-defense team headquarters. The county magistrate told reporters: Anxi has an area of more than 43,000 square kilometers. In the Han and Tang dynasties, there were 80,000 residents, but it gradually decreased later. In 1929, there were still 40,000 people, but now there are only more than 22,000 people left. In the past, counties outside the pass did not conscript Zhuang Ding, but replaced them with horses. Since this year, Zhuang Ding must serve in the military. The result of the conscription is that the population has sharply decreased again, and the young and strong have fled to other places. The old, weak, and women and children have been displaced. The original farmland has been abandoned. What is there to talk about reclamation? What is there to talk about immigration?</p>
<p>The vastness of the land, the inconvenience of transportation, and the distance between each township and county are often 70 or 80 li. (The nearest Yuquan town is 70 li away from the county seat, and the farthest Liugou township is 260 li away from the county seat.) Usually, the transmission of information relies on riding horses or walking, so the implementation of government orders is really slow. The land here is barren and lacks rain. Years of disasters have made people miserable, and the inability to guarantee supplies has made people silent for a long time!</p>
<p>Talking about the lack of light, heat, and water, the people's alienation from cultural education, the 90,000 square kilometers of no man's land, and the troubles that nomadic peoples bring to the people outside the pass...etc., are all common problems among the counties, which will be reported one by one later.</p>
<p>Under the dim kerosene lamp, listening to the rustling rain, until the dawn once again returned to the earth.</p>

<p>A month and a half ago, a reader wrote to this newspaper asking if there were any charitable organizations in Shanghai that could apply for emergency medical aid. We gave a brief answer in the "Letter Box" based on what we knew. In the past week, among the letters we have received from readers asking about emergency medical aid, there have always been three or five letters a day. Some asked to publish the hospitals and their addresses where emergency medical aid can be applied for in detail to benefit the sick. We feel that this is a social welfare undertaking, and the poor citizens of this city should know that if they unfortunately suffer from an emergency illness, they can get timely treatment, so that they will not lose their lives due to lack of medical treatment; or they will delay the opportunity of treatment due to temporary lack of medical expenses, and finally sacrifice their lives. Therefore, we do not hesitate to use space to give a detailed introduction. At the same time, we hope that the enthusiastic and wealthy people in this city will donate more to jointly participate in this righteous cause. Because this emergency medical aid organization, although it has directors who are solely responsible for the basic economic responsibilities and regularly bear huge burdens, also accepts donations from enthusiastic people outside and citizens who have been helped.</p>

<h3>Drug Trafficking and Extortion, Impersonating Military Officers: Dai Qian's Accomplices Arrested</h3>
<p>Four Criminals Escorted to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Police Headquarters</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Wuxi, 15th] In recent days, more than a dozen soldiers of unknown identity have been found at the Suzhou, Wuxi, and Wujin stations on the Nanjing-Shanghai line. Some of them were wearing civilian clothes. After Zhang Jiacang, director of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Police First Unit, discovered that their actions were secretive, he secretly paid attention to them and learned that they were all Dai Qian's accomplices. They often took the sixth train on the Nanjing-Shanghai line and arrived in Wuxi from Shanghai at about 11 AM. After staying in the urban area or teahouse, they returned on the 71st Taihu Lake train that night. Director Zhang then launched a reconnaissance operation. When the Taihu Lake train arrived at the Wuxi station early the day before yesterday, he saw a person in civilian clothes in the group of soldiers carrying light bulb cigarettes and other items, and hurriedly left the station with a flustered look, and immediately arrested him. At the same time, three soldiers were also arrested and temporarily detained. According to the person in civilian clothes, his name is Cong Zhenhua, originally from Sixian County, Anhui Province, 56 years old, living at No. 46 Inguo Lane, Suzhou. A bag of poisonous powder, 16 large and small gold rings, and a small gold bar were found on him on the spot. One of the soldiers in military uniform, named Yao Mingshi, 46 years old, from Linjin, Shanxi Province, living at No. 22 Yangyu Lane, Suzhou, was found with a bag of drugs and a forged work permit and business card of Lieutenant Colonel Chief of Staff of Zhang Xijiu's 19th Army. It was published that he graduated from the fourth phase of the military academy and was crowned with the title of Major General. One person, Ma Zhenhai, from Yixian County, Shandong Province, 26 years old, living at No. 124 Northeast Street, Loumen, Suzhou, had a diary containing the words "Dai Wu lost wind" written in it. (Note: Dai Wu is an illegal soldier who specializes in extortion in Shanghai and was wanted and arrested by the Songhu Garrison Command.) One person, Wang Zhennan, 30 years old, from Yinxian County, Zhejiang Province, living at No. 97 Xueji Street, Suzhou, was found with a directory of Shanghai industries and a newsletter of Shanghai firms. In addition to ordering the strict arrest of the remaining accomplices to bring them to justice, the above-mentioned criminals will be presented to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Police Headquarters for verification.</p>

<h3>江防戰急劇進行中　訪安慶前綫　（下）</h3>
<p>The River Defense Battle Intensifies: A Visit to the Anqing Front Lines (Part Two)</p>
<p>— 本所記者　劉藻</p>
<p>— By Our Correspondent Liu Zao</p>
<p>With the air force's reconnaissance reports providing a clear understanding of the Communist army's movements to the artillery positions of the defending forces, and the air force's strafing and bombing further boosting the morale of the defending troops, the Nationalists are using a three-dimensional warfare approach to overwhelm the Communist "human wave tactics." Under this three-dimensional firepower, the Communist "human wave tactics" are merely increasing their own casualties.</p>
<p>The navy is a successful component of this defense campaign. Its naval gunfire blockade prevents the Communist forces on the east and west flanks of the city from approaching the suburbs, and it also shields the victorious counterattacks of the defending forces. Even the numerous small hills in the northern suburbs of the city, which the Communist army attempted to use to evade naval fire, were subjected to flanking fire, resulting in significant casualties.</p>
<p>Major Zhang Jiabao, commander of the Fifth Naval Defense District, engaged in a lively discussion with the reporter on the "Yongding" warship about the Battle of Anqing, also considering it a successful example of naval-land coordination. As long as the defending forces requested naval gunfire at specific locations, the navy was able to smoothly direct its attack to those points with intense fire. However, in the "Battle of Anqing," the navy also had over a hundred soldiers wounded.</p>
<p>Air and Sea Coordination in Combat</p>
<p>The air force and navy's coordinated combat with the army in this defense of Anqing was the most outstanding engagement. The air force's reconnaissance ensured that the Communist army's actions could not escape the National army's control. As long as</p>
<p>The People of Anqing</p>
<p>The citizens have contributed significantly to the defense campaign over the past ten days. All men aged eighteen to forty-five participated in the National army's battle lines, serving as laborers, stretcher-bearers, medical staff, nurses, and constructing trenches. They did not evade their duties or complain during the intense fighting amid the roar of artillery fire.</p>
<p>The stability and composure of the people's lives within the city is truly surprising. They all have faith that Anqing is as solid as Mount Tai, so they have no fear of war.</p>
<p>Here, a pair of leather shoes costs only two Yuan silver dollars, while three pairs of cloth-soled shoes are priced at one silver dollar. Several days ago, because the defending forces received rewards from the Huazhong Pacification Headquarters, the number of silver dollars in the market suddenly increased, and the market price was lowered by silver speculators. One Yuan silver dollar cost only 13,000 gold yuan notes. Yesterday's market price was 28,000 per dollar. When the "Generals" took silver dollars to the streets to exchange them, they were deliberately undervalued by silver speculators, but they never complained. The citizens expressed unanimous praise for the strict discipline of the defending troops.</p>
<p>With the beautiful cooperation between the military and the civilians, today's Anqing defense battle has demonstrated extreme success.</p>

<p>The bulls in the aftermarket were unwilling to sell off at the limit, and trading could not be opened. The brokers all had a good time.

<h3>茶市交易式微</h3>
<p>Tea Market Transactions Waning</p>
<p>[Report from our office] The reporter met with a powerful person in the tea industry, according to reports: since the loss of credibility of the Gold Yuan, silver dollars that have been hidden for many years have once again become active in the market. It has been found that tea companies have switched to calculating the value of foreign exchange transfer certificates for export box tea, and domestic tea is also gradually quoting prices in silver dollars, except for a portion that is sold in gold. Therefore, when converted into Gold Yuan, it changes rapidly and new peaks emerge endlessly, which is very different from the past. However, buying has contracted, and transactions have become less and less, and there is more empty calling.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Advances</p>
<p>The Tung Oil market yesterday, since the publication of the mid-month index, colleagues are mostly busy raising money for employee salaries, and therefore have no intention of accepting. However, the sellers' quotation is still according to gold value, 3 dimes 3 cents per tan for full weight, 4 dimes per tan for green oil, and 3 dimes 8 cents for each bucket of West Hong from various brands, although there is a lack of competition, when calculated at the gold price of the day, it is still advancing to new peaks. As for the full-weight Tung Oil purchased by the China Trust Bureau, the purchase price continues to maintain the original judgment.</p>
<h3>市塲散步</h3>
<p>Market Stroll</p>
<p>— 看臺客</p>
<p>— By a Spectator</p>
<p>What is the Impact of the Hong Kong Gold Ban?</p>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, the Central Bank has been listing silver dollars for receiving gold, the first day the listed price was one gold for forty-eight silver, the second day was one to fifty, yesterday it was one to fifty-two, with a dual effect of raising the gold price on one side and lowering the silver dollar on the other.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I analyzed the matter of raising the gold price in this newspaper and reminded readers to be careful of fire, fearing that there would be illness in the fur. Now, I can add a few more materials, which are also in line with the conclusions of the previous analysis.</p>
<p>(1) Hong Kong has been banning residents from buying and selling gold since the fourth, and people are not allowed to hold it. The Hong Kong authorities will forcibly buy it.</p>
<p>In the past, the Hong Kong gold market was often one of the external causes that stimulated gold prices in Shanghai and other places. This move eliminated this external stimulus.</p>
<p>(2) The Hong Kong authorities will forcibly buy up gold stored by the people, so they will naturally announce an official purchase price. This official price, calculated according to the linked ratio of the Hong Kong dollar to the US exchange and the Hong Kong dollar to the British pound, plus freight, will not exceed 200 Hong Kong dollars per tael much. However, the market price of gold in Hong Kong before the ban was 320 Hong Kong dollars per tael. Therefore, the announcement of the official price will not have no impact on the domestic gold price. Because there may be some Hong Kong gold smuggled into the country.</p>
<p>Although merchants and people in Hong Kong are asking the Hong Kong authorities to consider the interests of merchants and people when deciding on the purchase price. Unfortunately, the problem does not lie in the interests of Hong Kong merchants, but in the exchange rates of the Hong Kong dollar and the British pound, which are both legal exchange rates in the International Monetary Fund. If the Hong Kong gold price is changed, it is tantamount to devaluing the Hong Kong dollar and the British pound, and then there will be disputes like the high-priced gold in South Africa in the past. Is the British side intending to fight the United States again? It seems unpredictable.</p>
<p>(3) The above are external factors. There is also a new internal factor, that is, the so-called "Financial Reform Amendment," which has been passed by the Legislative Yuan, and it will inevitably be a show of strength to save face.</p>
<p>Today, I will talk about the so-called suppression of the silver dollar. The so-called suppression of the silver dollar is nothing more than the "Overthrow Yuan Movement," making the small head sailing ship and Yuan silver dollar look the same. I have said repeatedly that now I want to talk about whether the Central Bank has a draft to raise the gold and silver ratio to what extent? I am not a roundworm in my stomach, so of course I cannot talk nonsense. However, I will list the historical changes in the gold and silver ratio below for your reference:</p>

<h3>分析今日青鐵大戰</h3>
<p>Analyzing Today's Qing-Railroad Showdown</p>
<p>[Report from our office] This season's football competition, the Mayor's Cup already belongs to the Railroad team, the Youth Cup was won by the Pan team, the Group B League Championship has become the Pan team's bag, and the Group C Championship is Yingguang. Whether the Group A League Championship can still be won by the Qingbai Association, or be monopolized by the Mayor's Cup champion Railroad team with a double championship, depends on today's most important battle. There are two games today, and the order is as follows:</p>
<p>10:00 AM: Zhichao vs. Qunli (Group A League) Yiyuan</p>
<p>3:00 PM: Qingbai vs. Railroad (Group A League) Yiyuan</p>
<p>In the morning game, the two teams drew in the previous match. In terms of recent form, the Zhichao youngsters have been in good form, and Qunli has also dominated in the South City. Their strengths are comparable, and a fierce battle is inevitable to fight for a better position.</p>
<p>The Qingbai vs. Railroad match is related to the championship battle. Qingbai still maintains an undefeated honor in the league, having only drawn with Jingwu. Railroad has only lost to Qingbai once. The two teams have played a total of ten games, and Qingbai is only two points ahead of Railroad. In today's game, Qingbai only needs to win or draw to overcome the difficulties and win the championship. If Railroad can beat Qingbai, the two teams will have the same score and will have to be decided again. This battle is not only a shortcut for Qingbai to win the championship, but also the last hope for Railroad to win the championship. Both sides have held general practice this week, strategizing and waiting for the time to strike, and will inevitably go all out. The recent situation of the two teams is as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name (Played) (Won) (Lost) (Drew) Total Score</p>
<p>Qingbai 10 9 0 1 19</p>
<p>Railroad 10 8 1 1 17</p>
<p>Qingbai's advantage lies in defense. Meng, Jiang, Xue, Zhang, Han, Fu and other flying generals guard the key points, preventing enemy cavalry from crossing Yinsan Mountain. To break through Qingbai's solid fortress, it is necessary to rely on high speed on both wings, which will inevitably be twice the effort for half the result. Failure to attack will lead to tired soldiers and weakened morale in the second half. Solid defense will be unstable. It is necessary to pay attention to this. It is said that "Qingbai has feet" and "Railroad has a head," which means that Luo Shoufu is good at shooting and Lu Sheng is good at cutting in and knocking on the barrier. Xiao Luo is the blood vessel of Qingbai. If Xiao Luo can move, then Lu Sheng and center Du Hu are both formidable. If Xiao Luo is restrained, Qingbai's offensive will inevitably be frustrated. The gain or loss depends entirely on this. When playing, it depends on the state of Xiao Luo and the state of the Railroad forward who is guarding Xiao Luo. I believe that Cao Liming is not Xiao Luo's opponent. Today, Wu Jiabang and Gao Baozheng will inevitably increase their burden.</p>
<p>Railroad is a team performance, with tacit coordination. The forward has Lu Qingxiang's head attack and Zhang Jie's rushing momentum, and Xiao Ziwen's opening road. I believe that Xiao should be transferred to the left wing to increase the speed of both wings, which will be enough to give Qingbai several threats. Binghao has a way and experience, but unfortunately his speed is not as good as Xiao Xiao. This is what is called advancing but not being able to be, rushing to the void. Xiao Xiao can rush to the void and create opportunities for Zhang Jie and Xiao Lizi, so there is a need to consider reorganizing the front line. Qingbai may not dare to be sure of winning and underestimate the enemy, so the Railroad generals should deal with it carefully, abandon the heart of gain and loss, and there is also hope for success. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Qingbai</p>
<p>Huang Shijie</p>
<p>Han Changrong Zhang Renyi Jiang Wenqing</p>
<p>Fu Naitang Meng Yiliang Xue Peiran</p>
<p>Jin Lusheng Luo Taofu Liu Long Gu Ersa Liu Tiyin</p>
<p>Railroad</p>
<p>Liao Xiong</p>
<p>Yue Renxiao Wu Jiabang</p>
<p>Lu Bingsheng Gao Baozheng Cao Liming</p>
<p>Wu Binghao Xiao Ziwen Qu Xigen Zhang Jie Lu Qingxiang Lin Xingyi</p>

<p>Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament Opens; Women's Group Adopts Men's Rules; Bing Team Wins Over Youth Team; Hualian Easily Defeats Friend Team</p>
<p>[Report from our office] The Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament opened last night. The women's Bing team defeated the Youth team, 23 to 10. This time, the men's rules were adopted, with a completely new look. In the second game, because the Police Machinery team forfeited, the Green Forest team and the MacLean team had a friendly match. After ten minutes, the result was a 51-point tie. The first overtime resulted in a 55-point tie. The second overtime still failed to determine the winner with 56 points. Due to time constraints, the game ended here. In the third game, Hualian defeated the Friend team. The difference in strength made it impossible to play hard. The result was 66 to 50, with 37 to 18 in the first half. About 2,000 spectators were most interested in the fierce friendly match.</p>
<h3>Rules for Women's Matches Against Men: A New Page in Sports History</h3>
<p>The "Ice Team" versus the "Youth Team" marked Shanghai's first official women's basketball game using men's rules, kicking off the Mayor's Cup basketball tournament. The players appeared more excited on the surface, but whether their general physical condition could "handle it comfortably" was another question.</p>
<p>Six minutes into the game, Sun Jingzhi of the Ice Team scored first. Zhu Zhen followed with a free throw, ending the first quarter with a score of 3-0. In the second quarter, Jingzhi scored again. The Youth Team struggled, and Fu Baozhen seized an opportunity to score two points, strengthening their fighting spirit. Sun Jingren of the Ice Team quickly retaliated. As the first half (sixteen minutes) ended, the Ice Team led 7-2.</p>
<p>The Ice Team continued to dominate in the third quarter. It was said that the team had "teacher-student cooperation," resulting in a score of 15-4 in this quarter. Although the Youth Team players were small, they displayed lively energy in the final quarter, earning more sympathy and encouragement than their older opponents. The final score was 23-10, and the Youth Team was eliminated.</p>

<h3>Exhibition Match Surpasses Regular Game: Green Forest and Mai Ling Tie</h3>
<p>Mai Ling versus Police Machinery. The latter had not completed their away games in Wuxi and reluctantly withdrew. The Green Forest team stepped in for an exhibition match. The initial five players for Green Forest were Le Jiazhou, Ye Yunshan, Chen Zhengmiao, Lin Shaohua, and Wang Cunzhong. Although Zhengmiao opened the scoring, the Mai Ling team, led by Hua Jikai and Xiong, quickly took a 6-2 lead. Green Forest fought hard. When Jiazhou made two free throws, the score was tied at eight. Le continued to score, pulling ahead 12-10. Mai Ling, with Ounas, Laislem, and Shan, pressed hard, making it 16-14, changing the situation again. Both sides had skilled shooters, leading to a back-and-forth battle. After a 20-20 tie, Green Forest gradually fell behind. At 25-20, Chen Guozhen replaced Wang Cunzhong. At halftime, Mai Ling was at 26, and Green Forest was at 24.</p>
<p>In the second half, through the efforts of Tianmiao and Jiazhou, the score was tied at 29. Mai Ling pulled ahead again. At the closest point, the difference was only one point. Green Forest scored many points with long shots. After Ye Yunshan committed his fifth foul, Green Forest made several adjustments. Finally, Le scored a goal, resulting in a 51-51 tie. No winner was determined.</p>
<p>In overtime (five minutes), Kaixiong scored two goals under the basket, and Jiazhou scored twice with back-to-the-basket shots, resulting in another 55-55 tie. In the second overtime, Zhengmiao scored one free throw first, and Mai Ling missed three free throws. Hua Jikai tied the score at 56, making it impossible to break the tie. By this time, it was already 8 o'clock, and since there was another game, they decided not to determine the winner.</p>
<h3>Disappointing Final Match: Uneven Strength Leads to Lack of Excitement</h3>
<p>Hua Lian versus Friendship Team was the third game last night. The Friendship Team was a combined force from the Pingping and Pushui teams. Fu Jinsheng scored a goal within three seconds. Wang Weijun of the Friendship Team surprisingly scored two goals in a row, taking a 4-3 lead. From then on, Hua Lian did not dare to relax. Fu Shan and Zhenzhong, and Songyuan quickly scored seven points, and soon it was 20-8. At halftime, it was 37-18.</p>
<p>In the second half, Xiangcheng replaced Da Li, but both were uninspired. Hua Lian adopted an open-door policy, relying on emotion, allowing the Friendship Team to compete on equal footing. Le Jiazhou of Hua Lian did not play because he had played in the Green Forest game. Li Hanting had already transferred to the Kang Team, so they only had six players last night. As a result, Hua Lian defeated the Friendship Team 66-50.</p>
<p>Hua Lian  Field Goals Free Throws Fouls Points</p>
<p>Wu Chengzhang 1   0   0   2</p>

<h3>Group B Second Round: Shantou Team Red Cavalry, Rematch Scheduled for Monday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Sports Association Basketball Committee held its fifth committee meeting at the Municipal Gymnasium yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Regarding the game between Shantou Team and Red Cavalry in Group B Second Round, Shantou Team protested the next day, requesting to preserve the game result and reschedule the rematch after the preliminary round. The committee resolved the following yesterday: After investigation, the reasons for Shantou Team's protest are valid, and Red Cavalry agreed to the rematch. Therefore, the rematch is scheduled for 7:00 PM on the 18th (Monday) to ensure fairness.</p>
<h3>Three Matches Tonight for Men and Women</h3>
<p>The Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament continues today with three knockout matches for men and women, starting at 5:30 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium. Ticket prices remain the same, with three categories: 5,000, 10,000, and reserved seating for 20,000. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>Group B Table Tennis League: Seven Matches Today</h3>
<p>The Fourth Table Tennis League continues today (17th) with seven Group B matches starting at 9:00 AM at the Cishu Third Floor Jingfen Billiards Room. The Seeded New Star Team and Star Light Team of Division B3 are both making their debut. Their opponents are mediocre, so they are sure to win. The Yucai Team consists of young players with refined skills, so the Jiaolong Team will likely have difficulty winning. In Division B2, the Tianxiang Team is no match for the Chongben Team. In Youlian versus Fansheng, the former has rising stars such as Zhou Muman, Zhang Jiliang, and Liu Guozhang, making them fiercely competitive. Although the latter has veteran players like Cai Senxiong and Wu Rongjiang, it will be difficult to blunt Youlian's edge. Lianqing and Xinghuo are both teams that have suffered defeats. Their skill levels are similar, so there will be a tough battle. In Division B1, Yongwu has veteran player Chen Zhenan, giving them strong momentum, so the Jianxin Team will be overwhelmed. The original Group A1 match tonight between Quanlv and Qinglian has been rescheduled because Quanlv's main player, Zhang Juchen, has not recovered from a back injury. They have obtained the latter's consent to reschedule and have reported it to the organizers for a make-up match. The schedule for today's matches is as follows:</p>
<p>Guansheng - New Star (B2) 9:00 AM Jingfen</p>
<p>Jinmen - Star Light (B3) 10:30 AM Jingfen</p>
<p>Jiaolong - Yucai (B3) 12:00 PM Jingfen</p>
<p>Tianxiang - Chongben (B2) 1:30 PM Jingfen</p>
<p>Youlian - Fansheng (B2) 3:00 PM Jingfen</p>
<p>Lianqing - Xinghuo (B2) 4:30 PM Jingfen</p>
<p>Yongwu - Jianxin (B1) 6:00 PM Jingfen</p>
<p>The Second Ma Team of Group B1 made their debut the night before and fought very bravely. Shuping only relied on Qian Weibian to win a valuable point, breaking the duck egg record. As a result, the Second Ma Team won 4-1. In the same division, the Second Hua Team suffered a painful defeat by Yousi, unable to resist, and lost 0-5. In addition, the Seeded Zhaoshang Team in Division B2 had skilled soldiers and strong generals. Each player easily defeated Lianqing in straight sets, and the five generals did not show any effort. Also, the process of Zhongnong versus Xin Yi was particularly fierce. Zhongnong lost the first group due to Chen Zhikun's loss to Sun Huimin in a tense match, affecting the overall situation. As a result, Xin Yi defeated their strong opponent again 3-2, which can be said to be extremely dangerous. The results of each match are as follows:</p>
<p>Second Ma defeated Shuping (B1) 4-1</p>
<p>Yousi defeated Second Hua (B1) 5-0</p>
<p>Zhaoshang defeated Lianqing (B2) 5-0</p>
<p>Xin Yi defeated Zhongnong (B2) 3-2</p>

<h3>Youth Cup Football Final: Pan Team Wins Championship; One-Goal Difference Over Longtou B</h3>
<p>The Youth Cup Final was held at 1:30 PM between the Pan Team and Longtou B. The referee was He Chunhui, and the linesmen were Zhang Zhiren and Chen Jixiang. Neither side could score. The Pan Team took the lead when Situ Hou scored on a penalty kick. Shortly after, Xie Shiying of Longtou tied the game. The Pan Team continued to work hard, and Qian Ming and Situ Hou each scored a goal, ending the first half 3-1. After switching sides, Longtou launched a fierce counterattack, with the center forward scoring a goal, making it 3-2. After that, although both sides worked hard, they were unable to score. In the end, the Pan Team won the Youth Cup by a one-goal difference.</p>
<h3>Longtou Three Hearts Red, China Aviation Unexpectedly Crushed: Boring Match, Fans Disinterested</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Longtou and China Aviation played in the Group A Football League yesterday afternoon at Yiyuan. Although the weather was good, the enthusiasm of the fans was poor, with less than 2,000 people attending. Furthermore, due to the boredom and low quality of the match, countless fans left after the first half. The atmosphere at the stadium was bleak. As a result, Longtou scored one goal in the first half and two more in the second half, hitting the target three times. Although China Aviation returned triumphantly from their away games, they were crushed. Longtou did not play as tightly as usual, and China Aviation was even more disorganized. However, the competition was quite fierce. Longtou captain Xia Shufu, who had not shown his face for a long time, also appeared on the field yesterday and worked especially hard. Northern fans kept cheering.</p>
<p>Referee Jiang Yinseng, the two sides engaged in a fierce battle, evenly matched and difficult to advance. The ball only circulated in the midfield. Until the 36th minute, Xia Shufu approached the opponent's goal and skillfully created a "steal." Chen Qin broke through and scored, taking the lead. China Aviation tried hard to counterattack, but often stopped at the gate and could not penetrate. The first half ended with a score of 1-0. After the break, the two sides reorganized. China Aviation did not change its original lineup, while Longtou Wu Kaimin stepped down, and Wang Burong replaced him. Longtou's morale was high, controlling the offense. Chen Qin received the ball and stuffed it into the middle. Xia Shufu galloped forward and shot it wide. Not long after, Jin Jiabiao committed a foul. Shi Dafa took a free kick, passed it low to the center, and Jiang Kun shot it on the rebound, hitting the crossbar. Chen Qin made a comeback, hooked it in at the baseline, Jiang Kun headed it, and Xu Fusheng just caught it. In the 40th minute, Xia Shufu came up with another "steal." Chen Qin seized the opportunity to enter and pushed it near the goal, scoring another goal, 2-0. In a moment, Longtou became greedy. Zhang Jingen passed it to the front of the goal, Jiang Kun rushed in and shot, hitting the bullseye again, making it 3-0. As the sun set, the silver whistle blew long, and China Aviation lost 3-0.</p>

<h3>Portraits of the Mayor's Cup Beauties</h3>
<p>— Hongchen</p>
<p>Spring is beautiful in Jiangnan, and the Mayor's Cup basketball tournament is in full swing again. In recent days, the league's good shows have just ended, and the final competition is about to be staged. The situation on the court is not only tense on the outside but also changing rapidly. The team leaders are busy pulling angles. The famous players are using their performances in the league as their market price. If they don't demand a "next-day advance," they are fools. The facts of the past three years tell us that the winner of this trophy is always a dark horse, leaving the fans with a mysterious impression, and then bidding farewell to the basketball season. Therefore, Hua Lian can hold the league's silver cup for four consecutive seasons, but cannot kiss this Mayor's Cup, which believers consider an odd number. The 3198 Signal Team, the Columbus American Ship, and the defending champion Dagong have successively broken Hua Lian's dream of winning two cups in a season. To review the pre-match situation of the Mayor's Cup men's group, the lessons of history tell us that we can only turn to the gods of fate.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would rather talk about the Mayor's Cup women's group. After it was once rumored that the Mayor's Cup women's group would adopt Canadian rules, suddenly, at a certain basketball committee meeting, with a tense difference of five votes to four votes, it was passed to change to playing men's rules. What accompanied this major change was that as many as nine teams signed up, breaking the history of Shanghai women's basketball. The women are all stirred up, reversing the past shy state.</p>
<p>Someone said: The old champion Green Team has always had very few players. This time, playing men's rules, not only has it not greatly recruited new players, but also whether the two guards Wang Weizhen and Wu Ailian, with their blessed appearance, can run the whole court is a question. In fact, the rules have changed. The trend of this year, based on basketball logic, is that the Green Team is still in a situation of receiving the silver cup first and then playing the game. Huang Mingyuan, Shi Zonglan, and Zhu Jinyun, these three trump cards of the Green Team, are enough to serve as capital to secure the championship. The problem lies in some emerging teams such as the You Team, the Ice Team, and the Eagle Team. Their original movements have only recently been learned from women's rules, and if they change to playing men's rules, I really don't know what a terrible appearance they will play. No wonder several referees are already worried about being unfortunately assigned to enforce the law in the women's group.</p>
<p>The most disadvantaged by changing to men's rules is the Li Team. Under the conditions of small stature and lack of experience, the hard training in recent days cannot achieve quick results. Whoever has the trick to eliminate their anxiety is the way. For example: Yao Silian, the center of the Li Team, has scored a lot of points in the league, but she can never be competent for the center position that takes care of both the front and the back in men's rules. The Green Team has Huang Mingyuan or Zhu Jinyun, the Ya Team has Wang Shan, and anyone from the Li Team to be the center will inevitably be ridiculed for being Liao Hua. Although Qian Chuping is the older sister of the Li Team, she has always been good at attacking the ball and is not suitable for being a center who must assist in defense.</p>
<p>The Ya Team is the original team of Xinghua in the league, plus Zhu Min and Sun Fengzhu. Judging from Xinghua's idleness in this league, I am afraid that the Green Team and the Li Team are more serious in their daily practice than they are when they play. However, this time they are determined to rise up, with team leaders, coaches, managers, and staff all complete. From Xuebai and Hu Ying to the so-called Minli women generals of today, perhaps it is a traditional habit that practicing the ball has always been less important than other teams. From Xiao Ying, Wang Weiling, and Zhang Xiuli to the recent Wang Zelen and Qian Mengyue, it seems that they are all a harvest of genius. However, under the banner of the Ya Team, coupled with the hint of the trend, they have been practicing at the gymnasium several times at 7:00 in the morning. The sharpshooter Qian Mengyue still shoots accurately, Zhu Min has always been accustomed to playing men's rules, and Wang Zelen's progress is traceable to prices.</p>
<p>Therefore, the scene of the Ya Team and the Li Team fighting for the runner-up in the future will definitely not be slightly worse than the battle that ended in a draw in the league! In the Mayor's Cup, where women play men's rules, it will be an opportunity to show experience. According to the playing history of the Ya Team players, there should be a better result than the league.</p>
<p>After the three seeded teams of Green, Ya, and Li, looking at the schedule, the encounter between John and the Eagle Team to fight for the fourth seeded team will have a fierce battle in the first game. The Eagle Team is the Shanghai Jiang from the University Games. At the beginning, they fought inextricably with John in the final. Only two months apart, the situation has changed greatly. The Eagle Team lacks Wang Shan, and John lacks Zhu Min. Obviously, the Eagle Team is more at a disadvantage. However, a loss may turn out to be a blessing. The Eagle Team simply lost the first game and ran into the circle of the unseeded championship. It would be more interesting to compete with the Li Force Team for the unseeded championship in the future.</p>
<p>As for the Minli Team, after Qian Mengyue, Wang Zelen, and Xu Xiuyun left, it has lost the strength it had when it dominated the middle school competition. As for the You Team, it has only recently sprouted new seedlings in front of the Nanyang Road girls' middle schools. At this moment, there is still a considerable distance to compare with the seeded teams.</p>

<h3>On Layoffs</h3>
<p>— Ai Yang</p>
<p>"Layoffs and government reduction, tightening of institutions" seems to have become the first new policy that every new official has after taking office. Dismissing redundant staff to save public funds sounds like a great undertaking!</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from my hometown saying that our county has changed three county magistrates and tightened its institutions three times in the past year and a half. Naturally, it has also laid off staff three times. However, someone counted the number of personnel in the current county government and found that it was not only not one less than a year and a half ago, but it actually had nine more employees. So, I began to doubt the "great policy" of layoffs. After repeated inquiries, I learned that layoffs meant getting rid of some old people and replacing them with some new ones. Out the front door and in the back door. Like the Central Bank's slips, they go out early and return late, which is still equal to the original. You can get the name of selling (layoffs) and also reap the benefits. Some people praise layoffs as the greatest good policy today. Is its "goodness" in this?</p>
<p>Since employees are laid off, severance pay must naturally be paid. At least one month, at most three months or more, to show the benevolence of the person in charge of the layoffs. For the laid-off person, it is not a pleasure to not work and get several months' salary now? It is really a win-win situation. Suppose a person who is good at activities is laid off from Party A and immediately transfers to Party B, and laid off from Party B and transfers to Party C, changing jobs every month and being laid off every month. I believe they can definitely make a "layoff fortune." —However, this is just an "ideal." Most of those laid off are often frowning, reluctant to part with their broken rice bowls. Since the laid-off person does not want to be laid off, the government has to pay him salary when he is not working. If you simply don't lay off, you can avoid hiring new people and make the old people feel at ease. Wouldn't it be good! But, this is also just an "ideal." If the old doesn't go, the new cannot be placed. Anyway, the money belongs to the public, so what does it matter if you spend a little more!</p>
<p>In the city where I currently live, there is a national bank with more than 70 employees. Among them, there are nine deputy managers and eleven assistant managers. Their daily work is to clock in and chat. One deputy manager said to someone: We are really "redundant staff," but the country just doesn't lay us off. Otherwise, if I am laid off, I can get dozens of months of severance pay, and I can take this money to speculate! This reminds people that the government's calculations are very clever. For example, if 10 billion yuan is prepared for severance pay, 2,000 employees with low salaries and belonging to ordinary agencies can be laid off. With the same funds, only dozens of senior employees of state-owned enterprises can be laid off. Of course, since it is a layoff, it is best to lay off more, because you can arrange more yourself. Alas, such layoffs!</p>
<h3>Strange Animal Tales</h3>
<p>— Cang Yi</p>
<p>The elephant's love for a partner is very dedicated, as long as its lifespan. When they are separated, they often refuse food to show their sadness.</p>
<p>The common female sea urchin lays five million eggs a year—almost as many as the population of Shanghai. There is also a type of female sand dollar that lays 40 million eggs each time.</p>
<p>Darwin, based on long-term and precise investigations, calculated that earthworms in England and Wales excrete more than 32,000 tons of feces each year.</p>
<p>Japan produces a famous luminescent animal called the peach shrimp, which has many light-emitting organs in its body.</p>
<p>White mice rest ten times and are active ten times (one hour each time) in 24 hours, and sleep for four hours. They do this every day without any deviation.</p>
<p>The armored fish produced in the coastal areas of Taiwan and southern Japan often live in the water with their heads down and tails up in a vertical line. If humans turn their bodies upside down with their heads down, they can only maintain it for up to several tens of minutes.</p>
<h3>The Smallest Republic</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>San Marino is the smallest republic in the world, located on Mount Titano, with medieval towers and battlements scattered throughout. Its entire area is surrounded by Italian territory. Its entire area is only 38 square miles, and its population is only about 15,000 people. However, this small country has a history of 1,600 years.</p>
<p>According to legend, this place was discovered by the Christian stonemason Marino. He lived here in seclusion in the fourth century. This mountain area was donated to him by a Christian landlord, and after his death, it was passed on to his followers, with the instruction that "no outsiders should interfere."</p>
<p>Although San Marino has tried its best to avoid disputes with the world, its strategic location is too important, as it is a natural vantage point for the northern Italian transportation line. Therefore, it is often involved in wars. As early as during Napoleon's conquest of Italy, this small country suffered the devastation of war.</p>
<p>As recently as 1943, during World War II, after Italy surrendered, Nazi armored vehicles drove into San Marino. Almost a year later, British troops advanced here and liberated it. This small country also resolutely rose up and declared war on Germany.</p>
<p>In terms of geography, the people of San Marino live a life of running up and down. As soon as you go out, you are either going down the mountain or up the mountain. Clusters of white farmhouses and churches with pointed roofs in medieval mountain towns appear on the slopes, extending to the rocky mountain peaks.</p>
<p>The capital, San Marino City, is located higher on the hillside. Here there are thick gates, narrow streets, and pointed stone buildings. The stone used for construction is the main wealth of the people of San Marino, and it has a long history. In addition to building stone, the export goods also include wine and cattle. San Marino's finances do not rely on banknotes, but on stamps. Because its stamps are varied and have exquisite patterns, they have long been loved by stamp collectors around the world. Each time new stamps are issued, they can always earn a lot of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>San Marino's national affairs are managed by a parliament composed of 60 deputies, all of whom are elected by the citizens. The parliament then appoints two people as administrative officers for a term of six months, which is the shortest term among the world's heads of state.</p>
<h3>Rules for Eating</h3>
<p>— Wang Deyun</p>
<p>In recent days, the price of rice has soared, breaking through the 500,000 mark, scaring ordinary folks. This suddenly made me think that we have always been casual when it comes to eating, but from now on, we really can't be careless. We must set rules for eating to avoid mistakes. Otherwise, "waste" may be unavoidable.</p>
<p>I hereby propose the following four rules for eating:</p>
<p>First Rule: Before eating, you must move your belt slightly upwards and then tighten it.</p>
<p>Explanation: This will inevitably put pressure on the stomach, greatly reducing the amount of food you can eat. It can save food and prevent you from feeling hungry, killing two birds with one stone and having only advantages and no disadvantages.</p>
<p>Second Rule: You must hang upside down when eating.</p>
<p>Explanation: Eating upside down is the best way to avoid wolfing down your food. We usually eat sitting down, and the rice grains slide straight down our throats. Unknowingly, one "slide" can be several bowls, a huge "loss" that goes against the "thrifty" way.</p>
<p>Third Rule: You must not move your teeth when eating; you must swallow the whole grain.</p>
<p>Explanation: This can achieve the great effect of enduring hunger.</p>
<p>Fourth Rule: You must not eat one bite at a time; you must count and swallow the grains one by one.</p>
<p>Explanation: Eating slowly and deliberately like this, a meal can last from six in the morning to eight at night, and you can skip lunch and dinner altogether. Isn't that wonderful?</p>
<h3>Poems of My Good Cottage</h3>
<p>— Zhu Airen</p>
<p>"Poems of My Good Cottage," written by Jiang Hongkui Weiqing of Changshu, consists of seventy-one ancient and modern style poems. What he writes is not much, but it is well-crafted. The five-character ancient poems, such as "Feeling About Saying Goodbye at Home While Serving as Secretary in Yaocheng in the Year of Wuxu," express: "Scholars in the world, what do the creators forbid? Hunger and cold press together, looking up and down, there is no place to stand. Frustrated, I construct strange thoughts, conjuring up plans to rely on others. My wife and children know my heart and suddenly add a suggestion in whispers: When young, you did not become famous; when old, you only seek profit in vain. Human life is not a hundred years; why lightly abandon flesh and blood! I lowered my head, dejected and heartbroken, secretly swallowing tears behind my back. The naughty maid hides in the shadow of the wall, sighing and sobbing too!" The feelings are true and the words are real, a master of plain description, making people sigh helplessly when reading them. The seven-character律詩, such as "A Winter Night in Rongcheng, Drinking with Wang Bingqing of Kuaiji, Yu Yicheng of Fuzhou, Xie Bingchen of Xiangxiang, and Wu Yanqing of Jinlv Among Flowers," say: "Deliberately abandoning hometown dreams, wine is repeatedly presented; tonight, in Rongcheng, we spend a small spring. Red friends gradually return to their true colors; yellow flowers faintly reveal their slender spirits. Who is composing 'Qingping Tune' before the wine? We are cold and lonely people meeting on the river. The moon shadow is plump and enclosed, night rain is coming, yet it teaches drunken sleeves to wash off fragrant dust." With each cup and each poem, deep feelings are expressed. The couplet about the true colors of red friends and the slender spirits of yellow flowers is just right. My heart loves it. Another example is "Living in Seclusion in Yan Garden": "Surrounding the painted eaves are mountain lights on all sides; indeed, Yuan Jiu lived in Pengying. Not leaving tax burdens to children and grandchildren, I especially love the clear water and rocks of the garden. At the edge of the sky, the pavilions and towers have cold shadows; in the clouds, chickens and dogs are silent. Peach Blossom Spring has long been separated from the human world; woodcutters, do not spread the Han Dynasty name!" The water is clear and the sand is clean, untainted by a single speck of dust. It is difficult to accomplish this without exceptional talent. Other excellent lines include "Climbing Shengmu Tower on Mochou Lake in Jinling": "The mountain colors and lake light remain from the Six Dynasties; the heroes and heroines each have a thousand autumns." Feeling in the Camp: "The arrogance has not been removed; few know me. Childhood has passed; reading is difficult." On an autumn day, I got drunk with Lou Donglu Xiaolian Xinlan at the foot of the northern mountain, playfully composing poems about the mixed display of wild vegetables and mountain delicacies: "The fragrance suppresses three dou of millet from the small trough; tenderly picking a few stalks of vegetables from the old garden." Visiting Shan Fuqing of Shenjiang at his hidden residence in Yuxi Dianqiao: "Gulls skim the sand marks, passing through reeds; geese drag mountain colors, flying near the lake." At Poshansi Temple: "Empty pond with messy yellow leaves, winding path with deep white clouds." When Zhuo Jianqiu, the second governor of Guangdong, left Zhaowen to take up his post in Yuanhe, I wrote a poem to send him off: "A kindred spirit is thousands of miles away; tonight, we share a cup together." Traveling in Kunshan on Qingming Festival: "The Zen heart is half drunk with the fragrant breeze; the mountain colors are completely evened by the overnight rain." All are clear, beautiful, and worth reciting.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>— Binzhi</p>
<p>Due to the malignant inflation of the Gold Yuan Certificate, the value of Yuan Datou (Yuan Shikai silver dollar) has increased daily, reaching unprecedented heights. If Yuan Shikai knew in the afterlife, he would smile with satisfaction in his grave.</p>
<p>Silver dollars are imported goods. The first batch to come to China were Spanish coins, as early as the late Ming Dynasty. At that time, the quantity was small, and circulation was not widespread. By the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty, trade with overseas countries became increasingly prosperous, and silver dollars flowed into China in large quantities. At first, they only circulated in Guangdong and Fujian provinces, but by the Daoguang period, they were also circulating in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhili, and other provinces. Later, they were also found in inland provinces, with names such as horse coins, lace coins, and cross coins.</p>
<p>Following the Spanish silver dollar, the Mexican silver dollar also flowed into China during the Xianfeng period, which is the so-called "Eagle Dollar." In the thirty years that followed, Eagle Dollars flowed in large quantities, surpassing the Spanish silver dollar in influence. The British occupied Hong Kong and also minted silver dollars for use in Hong Kong and mainland China. Because the fineness was relatively low, they were not very popular. Later, they changed to minting a new coin in India, which was better than the ones minted in Hong Kong, and it became more widely circulated in China. Japanese silver dollars were also imported into China during the Guangxu period. After adopting the gold standard in 1897, Japan exported its discarded silver dollars to China. In addition, Annamese silver dollars and American silver dollars also appeared in the Chinese market.</p>
<p>China's own minting of silver dollars began in the sixteenth year of Guangxu. At that time, because foreign silver coins were rampant, Zhang Zhidong requested permission to open a mint in Guangdong. Before Zhang Zhidong, Lin Zexu had also requested permission, but it was rejected by the ministry. At that time, private individuals also minted silver dollars. During the Daoguang period, Zhejiang Province minted one-tael silver dollars, and Zhu Yuyuan in Shanghai also minted one-tael silver coins during the Xianfeng period. Because the price was inconsistent with the circulating silver dollars, circulation was not widespread. Many silver furnaces and silver shops also imitated silver coins, with names such as "Guang Board," "Jian Board," "Zhe Board," and "Su Board," but these silver coins were not well-received due to their poor weight and fineness.</p>
<p>The silver dollars minted in the sixteenth year of Guangxu weighed seven mace and three fen, with a coiled dragon pattern and the characters "Guangxu Yuan Bao" in both Manchu and Chinese, as well as "Made in Guangdong Province." After the Dragon Dollar was produced, its performance was excellent, so Hubei, Jiangsu, Fujian, Zhili, and other provinces imitated it and circulated it. Later, because the weight and fineness of the silver dollars minted in each province were inconsistent, circulation was greatly affected. In the twenty-seventh year of Guangxu, it was stipulated that each coin should weigh seven mace and two fen and that Hubei and Guangdong provinces should mint them to ensure uniformity. In the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu, the Ministry of Revenue Mint was established in Tianjin to standardize the form of silver coins, which is the "Beiyang Province Made" type of silver dollar we have today.</p>
<p>After the founding of the Republic of China, silver coin regulations were promulgated in the third year, stipulating that each coin should weigh seven mace and two fen and contain .8923 pure silver, which is the Yuan Datou. After the Nanjing and Hangzhou mints were established, they were minted in even greater quantities. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, due to supply falling short of demand in the market, the fineness was reduced to .8895. The current value of Yuan Datou varies in some places depending on the year of minting, and there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>Although Yuan Datou was produced in large quantities, each province still minted its own silver coins under the separatist rule of the warlords. There were many different types, such as the Three Eastern Provinces coin, Sichuan Ocean, Yunnan coin, Jilin coin, and Feng Ocean, with inconsistent forms. Moreover, the fineness was greatly reduced in order to seek profit. The current value of Sichuan Ocean is lower than that of other silver coins, and this is the reason.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the National Government, Sun Yat-sen coins were re-minted. The fineness and weight of Sun Xiaotou were originally the same as Yuan Datou, but now there is a difference in value. I wonder if it is because of the size of the head. Later, the design of the silver coins was changed to sailboats. However, the legal tender system was implemented soon after, and silver dollars were hidden away. It was not until more than ten years later that they reappeared. A scholar who has been away for three days must be looked at with new eyes. After being separated for more than ten years, the value of the silver dollar is now ten thousand times what it once was.</p>
