<h3>成渝鐵路積極修建</h3>
<p>在烽火連天的今日，我們欣聞一件建設的消息，成渝鐵路現正積極修築中，不可謂非空谷足音了。成渝鐵路自三十五年十月復工到現在，經過了許多波折，以及意想不到的阻碍，幾乎工程中途停輟。由於川省地方當局的奮鬥，和交通部的支持，該路工程得以繼續進行，前傳本年一月起該路即無工款之說，已經當局否認。近據確息，本年度國家總預算已根據該路三年通車計劃將所需國內外用款，一併列入預算開支，交部仍根據本預算繼續發款中，不僅該路工程未予停輟，且有提早完成的可能。此爲四川之幸運，並且爲西南交通劃一新紀元。我們欣聞這個和平建設的消息，實感無限愉快！</p>
<p>四川號稱「天府之國」，人口衆多，物產豐富，惟在四〇四千方公里面積內，缺乏一條鐵路聯繫，以致各項建設，均受影響，確爲一件憾事。四川人民爲了鐵路問題，在滿淸末年創開革命之先河，迭成辛亥的局面。鐵路在四川人民眼裏，是一切經濟文化的樞紐，並且是七千萬人口生存發展的神經；四川人民是盼求有一條鐵路的。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，國民政府在陪都重慶時，曾擬恢復成渝鐵路的興建，但因料款缺乏，遂至半途停頓。勝利復員後，蔣主席對四川人民臨別贈言，曾肯定的說，決意爲川省修建一條鐵路，並手諭交通部須於兩年內，完成成渝鐵路之修建，由國庫撥款二百六十億。當時全川人民聞之，莫不感到興奮。詎料三十五年一年間，撥款杳無消息，川省人民有失望之感。去年交通部始將成渝鐵路修建費列入預算，核定爲四百億，較三十五年之估計，已高出一百四十億。離然該路工程不斷進行，終以材料缺乏，路款不濟，工程幾陷停頓。川省建設廳當局在無可奈何中，曾與法國銀行團商量貸款，並獲相當成效。四川人民認識舉外債建設鐵路，可能損及國家權益，大多表示不贊助，他們渴求國家將該路修建工程費用列入預算，或請中央發還川省穀款內提一百萬擔抵充，以四川人民的錢糧爲四川修路。交通當局原則同意，惟決心毅力不够，致有許多波折和頓挫，該路橋樑隧道和土石方工程，迄今僅成功二分之一，距離通車的日程還是相當遼遠的。</p>
<p>按成渝鐵路，依三十五年十一月間之藍圖，全長由成都武侯祠起至重慶九龍坡止，共計五百二十餘公里。沿途所經，皆工　發達，農產原料豐富之區，對於四川建設上的幫助，自不待言。成渝路局爲了配合川省建設計劃，去年重新擬訂三年通車計劃，準倫積極趕修成功。第一年度（會計年度）即三十七年至三十八年六月，完竣由渝至永川的路面工程，俟今年田美購得鐵軌枕本運到重慶後，立即舖築到朱楊溪，年底可通車，第二年度（今年七月至三十九年六月）通東到內江。第三年度（三十九年七月至四十年六月）全綫通車。若購料外匯能迅速撥給，工程迅予核准，全綫通車，可提前至三十九年底，縮短半年的期限。最近該路工程積極進展，如中途不致再有阻礙，明年七月全綫通車，亦屬萬分可能</p>
<p>成渝鐵路在非常時期興建，意義是很重大的。該路修建成功對於建設上的幫助，固不待言，對於四川人民心理上，亦必發生極大的安慰與鼓舞。從抗戰戡亂的經過講，四川對於國家民族，曾有極大的貢獻。中國沒有四川，對日的抗戰不能堅持到八年之久；今天淮北戰塲捍衛長江大河的軍隊，多半又都是四川的健兒，足徵抗戰戡亂的十年中，沒有四川人民的忠誠合作，後方不能有那樣穩定。四川人民唯一的渴求是這條鐵路，他無奢求，國家不應辜負他們的。</p>
<p>現在成渝鐵路積極興建，通車有期，全國同胞與四川人民，竭願早日觀成，並在將來再以全力謀其發展，使該路血脈昇華到最高點！</p>

<h3>荷公然違反安理會決議　美代表來回指斥　要求荷早日成立印尼自由聯邦</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十一日電〕美國十一日譴責荷蘭「公然遠抗」聯合國命令，並要求荷蘭早日舉行選舉，成立「眞正自由」之印尼聯邦，並於最近數月內撤退東印度境內之一切荷軍，並立卽釋放印尼領袖。美代表傑塞普在安理會中指斥蘇聯旣不欲印尼境內之和平，又不欲印尼共和國之存在，僅欲「受命於莫斯科之共黨少數黨所控制之印度尼西亞」。</p>
<p>傑氏指出，蘇聯拒不支持在巴黎會議時之美國提案，以及共黨社評指荷蘭之警察行動爲「懲處」蘇卡諾總統與哈泰總理之壓制共黨去年在末里粉之叛變，均可爲明證。但傑塞普之最嚴厲抨擊，仍在於荷蘭，渠稱：「荷蘭當局拒不立卽停戰，並拒不釋放印尼領袖，其未曾遵照安理會之命令，非任何藉口所能掩飾。安理會中荷蘭代表不能使荷蘭政府推卸荷蘭被指爲已違犯聯合國憲章之控訴」。傑氏以美國在聯合國中對蘇聯以外任何國家所未曾引用之嚴厲措詞談稱，根據調解委會之報吿，證明荷蘭之各種活動，甚至在此次軍事攻勢之前，均旨在顚覆印尼共和國。渠繼稱，荷蘭政策不僅使「人民遭受不必要之病苦」，並旨在組織「共和國政府未曾參預之預先籌劃妥當之印尼政府」。傑塞普宣稱，將不容荷蘭以武力解決彼等與共和國之糾紛。反之，荷蘭必須開始割斷荷蘭與荷屬東印度間之聯繫。安理會十一日會議中以傑氏首先發言。本日休會後，定於十四日復會。本日尙有中蘇等代表發言。</p>

<h3>要求改善指數編製辦法　工會連日集會商討　數謁當局提供意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自上年年底物價展開漲風以來，迄今已將匝月，在此一月中，物價幾無日不漲，但去歲十二月份之生活指數僅十八倍三，本市百餘萬依生活指數計算薪津之產職業工人，羣起恐慌，職工團體紛紛向總工會要求修改現行指數編算方法，並研究對十八倍三過低指數之補救辦法。工會諸負責人連日集會商討，並數度晋謁市政首長，提供改善指數編製意見三點：（一）目前指數中房租一項，尙係去年七月間所調查，工界方面曾屢次要求每隔三個月調查一次，當局允每隔六個月調查一次，縱以六月為期，一月份指數中之房租亦應重新調查計算。（二）產職業工人之重點配給，除米外其他油·糖·煤球等項，早已名存實亡，指數中自不能再依配給價計算。本月份之重點配米證迄未發齊，故指數中所有食米，應一律按市價計算。（三）邇來物價直綫飛昇，每週調查二次物價，實嫌過少，應增加爲每週調查三次，本月份上期指數起卽予實施。</p>
<p>統計專家談話　分析脫節原因</p>
<p>記者昨日分訪對生活指數研究有素之民間統計專家數位，綜合彼等意見如下：（一）生活指數計薪辦法本身已不甚健全，尤在惡性通貨臌脹，幣値高速度貶落之今日，更不適用。因指數僅代表一時期與某一時期生活費用之比較數，在物價緩慢週期性上漲時用作計薪標凖尙可，而目前物價一日數漲，十天半月間往往已上昇數倍，此半個月中之平均數，自再不能與物價等量齊觀，用以計薪，當難以求得基期薪給之等値。若物價漲勢常此以往，指數計薪實有代以實物計薪之必需。（二）目前職工底薪係以去年八月十三日指數三六三萬倍計薪後折合金圓計算，此三六三萬倍之指數與當日之實際物價已相差百分之二十五，而現行指數中物價又係以「八一九」限價為基數，八·一三與八。一九之間六天中物價平均又上漲百分之六十，故限價開放後之指數較諸改革幣制前之指數計薪價値已不相同，在種種積因之下，指數興物價相距自亦日違矣。</p>
<h3>沙劉文停業糾紛　社局定今日處</h3>

<h3>醒糧價隨時調整　本月內不致實現</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕都市配糧售價隨時調整之辦法公佈後，今後戶口米價之波動，殆屬難免。惟據記者自有關方面獲悉：此項新辦法因技術上種種問題，在本月份內不致實施。該方面人士並吿記者；成本價格雖將為今後決定配糧售價之重要因素，惟中美雙方當不致採取一味追隨市價之措施，是則繼續由中美雙方貼補虧損，勢所難免。以過去情形而論，中美雙方貼補數額常達售價三分之二，由於中國政府負責籌劃全部配糧百分之六十，故政府貼補之數額尤大，如去年十月份，政府卽虧損達一億八千八百餘萬金圓，美方則為八千八百萬金圓。長此以往，自難維持，新辦法實行後，雙方之虧損卽可减少，收回糧款隨之增加，都市配糧制度之維持不輟，乃可獲得保證。</p>

<h3>空運國際難民爭執　遠洋航空公司讓步</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於空運國際難民所引起之六大航空公司與國際難民組織之爭執，外傳國際難民組織已表示願意接受各公司協助輸運難民之要求，茲悉並不確實，國際難民組織僅函復各公司稱租用遠洋航空公司飛機乃日內瓦總部所決定，其他並無表示。惟遠洋航空公司駐滬代表鑒於如此事形成僵局，對該公司極為不利，故已自動向六大航空公司表示願出讓一部份客位，雙方現在折衝中，尙未達具體協定。另一方面民航局已批准遠洋公司三架飛機起降，將載白俄百餘人至菲律濱及澳洲，故此次糾紛相信卽可解決。</p>

<h3>本年度市府總預算　參會小組整理竣事　歲入共列七億二千餘萬圓</h3>
<p>本市卅八年度歲出歲入總預算書，前經參議會第八次大會決議，照預決算委員會審查報吿書修正通過後，昨已由該小組整理竣事，卽將函送市府執行。據悉：修正通過之卅八年度總預算書，總歲入部份共列七二七。三〇七·一五八金圓，此項數字，較市府原編預算增列一三一·三一〇·〇〇〇金圓，其中計地價稅增列三千萬金圓，營業稅增列九千萬金圓，屠宰稅增列五百萬金國，違警罰金增列三十六萬金圓，警察行政規費增列四十五萬金圓，淸潔所營業收入增列五百五十萬金圖，並決定上項追加之歲入及將來因通貨膨脹稅收增加之數額，暨各項報酬金之增加金額與市府裁併駢枝機構，淘汰冗員之節餘，均移作調整員工待遇之準備金及增加事業經費之預備金。關於總歲出部份，審查報吿書中提出建議三點：（一）市府組織規程，應迅卽確定，在未確定前，應請市府不再成立新機構及不再增加員額，以節支出。（二）切實裁併駢技機構及裁汰冗員。（三）修建方面應採取重點政策，無論道路。橋樑。房屋。車輛。辦公用具，其可暫緩修建者，應卽從緩，至非修建不可者卽應澈底修造，以收一勞永逸之效，而免徒耗公帑。該報告書並鑑於未來市財政之困難情形，最後提出結論稱：「為未雨綢繆計，旣不能再闢新稅，以增市民負祖，則惟有節省支出，以期收支近乎平衡。」</p>
<p>切實裁併駢枝機構</p>
<p>該審查報吿書中建議市府切實裁併駢枝機構及裁汰冗員一節，對市府所屬各局均曾詳細提出意見如下：（一）警察行政部份，主張裁撤少年警察隊，飛行堡壘亦應與機動車大隊合併，並裁撤一部份人員，各分局流動派出所亦應裁撤，並取消經濟警察之名義，將原有任務歸還一般行政警察，所有員額分別充實各分局及保警隊，警察敎育館亦應裁併於警察學校管理之下。（二）敎育行政部份：國民敎育班，徒擁虛名，應將此項經費改作添設國民學校班級及增建國民學校校舍之用，巡迴施敎隊裁撤，以其經費充實國民敎育及中等敎育，此外如浦東鄕村敎育區，滬西民生敎育區，電化敎育隊，民衆識字運動委員會等組織，亦應一併裁撤，所節經費，分別緩急，另定用途。（三）工務行政部份：園塲管理處等若干疊牀架屋之機構均應裁撤。（四）公用行政部份：車輛登記所應改革，以其業務併於第四處，俾使業務與行政一元化。（五）衛生行政部份：性病防治所，牙病防治所等，實無另行設立之必要，均應裁撤，各市立醫院應請改為公立，設立董事會，院址房屋由市府免費租賃，仍賣成各醫院保持原有之免費病牀，本年度預算內所列之經費，應改為補助費。（六）社會行政部份：社局所辦之三公典，資金短絀，實效甚鮮，亦應停辦。至裁汰冗員方面，該報吿書中指出市府秘書處技工有一二〇人，應請淘弱留强，酌請裁减。工務局因經濟困難，材料缺乏，工程旣不能照預定計劃進行，修築道路人員，亦應整頓裁减。財政局營業稅實施簡化稽徵後，營業稅科及各稽徵處管理營業稅之人員，亦可酌减，以節公帑。</p>
<p>市參議會　發表聲明</p>
<p>又訊，本市參議會發言人，對於昨晚時事新報晚刋刋登該會審查卅八年度市總預算消息，發表聲明稱，本會第八次大會審查卅八年度市總預算，以原預算草案歲入門所列各項稅收預算，尙有未能盡臻合理之處，故經預決算委員會縝密審議，將若干稅收預計收入數酌量增列，旣未自動增闢新稅，亦未提高稅率，以增加人民負担。增列歲入預算目的，在使預算能盡量接近事實，兼以督促政府稅務人員，認眞達成執行預算之使命，此乃本會應有之任務，該報標題曰：「審查預算一怪例，代表上海人民的市參會，竟然通過增加歲入預算」，殊屬混淆觀聽。</p>
<h3>英商電車　一度怠工　工人拒絕開車出廠　待遇過低要求四點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英商電車公司所屬各綫有軌無軌電車，昨晨突然怠工，匯山路及赫德路兩廠外勤工人一律拒絕開車出廠。該公司產業工會理監事得訊，立卽前往勸導。羣衆情緒激昂，謂待遇過低不能生活，紛紛提出要求，綜合計為四項：（一）依照電話公司現行辦法，每人每天加發飯貼七角五分。（二）年賞於本月十四日先發每人三千元，照本月份生活指數計算，不足之數，俟指數發表後再補。（三）將每月十日，廿日，卅日發薪辦法，改為五日，十五日，廿五日發薪。（四）無軌電車司機照前規定每月加發執照費二元。當經工會理監事答允向資方提出交涉，工人始行復工。赫德路廠於十時廿分開出第一輛電車，匯山路廠於十一時開出第一輛，至中午各綫車輛已完全恢復正常。</p>
<p>下午，工會理監事赴社會局請求調解，未有結呆，今日將繼續前往請求。</p>

<h3>當局平抑物價漲風　決定拋售物資辦法</h3>
<p>當局為平抑物價漲風，決定組織小組委會，全力拋售物資。昨日下午四時中央銀行陝述曾美援會徐宗蔚經合署惠特舉行會議，幷經擬定拋售物資辦法五項如下：</p>
<p>（一）由經合署美援聯營會及央行組織之三人委員會負責處理拋售事宜，以經合署代表為主委。</p>
<p>（二）紡建公司承託執行拋售手續售得之款，由客戶直接繳入央行，及美援聯營小組內鎖帳戶。</p>
<p>（三）每日由紡建將市塲價在上午十一時至十二時報吿該會，然後由小組決定撤售數目。品量。在市塲掛牌。拋售方式在交易時間內得以各種不同支數之棉紗及商標不固定款數舉行，請購人塡註請購單，交於收單處。截止收單後，中紡建公司會同小組代表及市塲監理人在監視下啓箱。如夫超過數量，則當然照配。如超過時，則由該小組決定减少。其餘手續照紡建公司規定代理辦法辦理。</p>
<p>（四）拋售對象，以在紡建登記之紗商及各複製業為對象。</p>
<p>（五）此項辦法應卽通知紗業公會，幷請指派代表一人監視啓箱，幷在請購單上加舊戳記證明。</p>
<h3>中紡繼續大量拋售　紗布市况依然挺俏</h3>
<p>美援花紗布聯營處中央銀行暨中紡公司等昨日掛牌大量拋售棉紗計美援紗布聯營處委中紡公司掛牌拋售四十二支紅藍鳳紗一種，中央銀行委中紡公司掛牌開售廿一支金雙馬紗一種，又中紡公司本身開售六支副日光等棉紗十三種，各方大量供售，以吸收游資。</p>
<p>棉紗昨市重吿挺俏，因受金融性物品上升刺激，人心轉俏，買聲轉見濃厚，市價步趨堅昻。四二支藍鳳由八四〇〇〇元喊高至九〇〇〇〇元收市，較前漲起一一五〇〇元。四〇支藍鳳晋九〇〇〇元，三二支銀月開市七〇〇〇〇元，中途至七四〇〇〇元為最高，午收為七三〇〇〇元，終升一〇〇〇〇元。二一支雙馬現貨初以五一〇〇〇低檔開出，旋喊至六〇〇〇〇元尙有人買進，收前曾破六〇〇〇〇元關，至六〇五〇〇元新高價，最後復回小至五八五〇〇元，軋漲九五〇〇元。廠單隔日出做五七五〇〇元。二〇支雙馬自四六〇〇〇元步昂至五二〇〇〇元結束，較前挺八〇〇〇元。一六支光明與三明等俱在四〇〇〇〇元關外成交，其餘各紗皆見挺秀。</p>
<p>布市反動騰升，晨開卽呈俏俐。良以上日劇瀉後，乘低進取者頗衆，台灣帮與粵帮等亦有零星吸胃，本街染廠對坯布搜現甚殷，尤以龍頭與五福喇叭童等細布因籌碼枯竭，求多供少，走勢殊俏。其餘各級一致回漲二成左右。龍頭細布塲外初喊二〇〇〇元，午刻再高至二二〇〇元，中檔細布僅做開B龍頭及靑島貨如喜鶴等。至於市價亦軋高三〇〇元至四〇〇元不等，四君子元嗶嘰自一九二〇元喊至一九四〇元為最高，近午曾低見一八四〇元，收市復回好至一八三〇元，終漲二三〇元。聞收後一九二〇元尙有人問津。四君子元直貢較前升二一〇元，以一九五〇元結局，廠家開貨以印花嗶嘰軋高最鉅，比上日竟漲五〇〇元之譜。</p>
<h3>絲綢回升</h3>
<p>生絲優級市祖，初開為八八〇〇〇元，嗣因市塲喊高，買氣轉濃，價乃上揚。午收升為九二〇〇〇元，較昨升六七千元，輯里干經升為七〇〇〇〇元。餘乏問津。外銷洋行帮，因外匯證折合，與市價距離又大，故均觀望，前途又呈沉寂。</p>
<p>人絲天橋初開為八二，〇〇〇元，旋卽升至八八〇〇〇元，為卽期現貨。明票交易，為九四〇〇〇元。較昨市午收升一萬餘元。同業套利日拆九角至一元，斯尼亞西石為九二〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>綢緞：華强被面初開為四八，五〇〇元，最高至四九八〇〇元，午收稍回，為四九〇〇〇元。美亞被面升為四九五〇〇元，較昨午收升七千元左右。</p>
<h3>紡織呂輪出比例　聯營處要求增加</h3>
<p>為增加紡織品輸出，外銷聯營處決定向政院要求增加輸出比例，由各廠生產率之百分之廿增至百分之卅，政院可能加以核准。至目前外銷紡織品，係以印尼一帶為最多。</p>
<h3>出口結匯略减</h3>
<p>上週共二百四十餘萬美金</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會消息：本週（三日至八日）上海一埠出口貨物申請結匯金額，較上週略减。全部數字，折合美金二，四一七，五〇七·三一元，其中包括政府自行結匯（卽冰蛋紗布等）出口貨物美金四三七，六二一·三一元。商品種類共計十九種，其中以茶佔苜，計四八五，五六一·一二元，次為其他植物油，計三六〇，三九〇·五〇元。三為布匹，計二五七，一一〇·三三元。四為猪鬃，計二二九，〇八六·一三元。桐油佔第五位，計一九三，二〇〇·〇〇元。</p>
<h3>內率修正</h3>
<p>四行兩局一庫內匯率决於十三日修正如次：厦門三〇〇元，福州二五〇元，泉州三〇〇元，廣州二五〇元，汕頭三〇〇元，海口三〇〇元，湛江三〇〇元，柳州二〇〇元，桂林二〇〇元，梧州二〇〇元，南寗二〇〇元，長沙一五〇元，衡陽一八〇元，沅陵一八〇元，武漢二〇〇元，沙市二五〇元，宜昌二五〇元，南昌一〇〇元，九江一二〇元，吉安一五〇元，重慶二五〇元，成都三〇〇元，萬縣三〇〇元，自流井三〇〇元，蕪湖一〇〇元，安慶一〇〇元，昆明二〇〇元，天津二〇〇元，北平二〇〇元，靑島一〇〇元，其他各地不動。</p>
<h3>僑匯掛牌又升　外匯證價穩定</h3>
<p>昨日僑匯掛牌又升二十元，計爲一九〇元。外匯轉移證因央行拋售頗多，價仍穩定，收盤一八八元進，一八九元出。</p>
<h3>進口簽證尺度放寬</h3>
<p>每週平均二五〇萬美元</p>
<p>據輸管會息，自進出口連鎖制實施以來，因出口結匯價格隨時按照事實調整後，出口事業顯已較前好轉。輸管會方面爲澈底推行進出口連鉗制起見，對於進口簽證之審核尺皮，最近亦已再度放寬，目前每日簽發之輸入許可證，約在二十萬美元至四十萬美元之間，每週平均在二百五十萬美元左右。此項簽發之許可證中，除大部係屬於限額部份經提早簽發外，其屬於非限額部份者為數亦鉅。如出口情况能繼續好轉，則第九十兩季限額之放寬，可望獲致當局之同意云。</p>
<h3>國行利率掛牌更改</h3>
<p>國行昨日利率掛牌，重貼現日拆改為廿三元三角，合月息七角。拆款日拆改為十九元二角，合月息五角七分六。</p>
<h3>國行積極準備改善　外幣存單抵用辦法</h3>
<p>自備外匯特種外幣存單，自市商會提出建議改善抵用辦法以後，財部曾於十日在京邀集中央銀行，中信局，輸管會等有關機關會商。頃悉是項會議中，對於抵用辦法，決維持政院所核定之原則。對於發行技術，則力求簡捷。中信局中央銀行已在積極凖備，中信局趕辦通知書邊中央銀行，中央銀行卽製印外幣存單，抵用外匯部份預計下週卽可發出。</p>
<h3>銀根稍見寬鬆　米糧粉油又回漲</h3>
<p>昨日米市復吿挺升，因銀根稍鬆，業外物價回昻，人心亦同吿轉挺。加之到貨减少，晨開喊價卽提升約二百元。但以暗息仍高，納戶胃口不暢，是以雖漲而去化不活，乃吿回低五十元。南市塲白粳做一千四百四十五元，薄稻價初為一千五百元，收市一千四百五十元，早稻一千四百元，各較上日升一百五十元光景。白元漲一百五十，陰元加二百元。北市塲早薄稻及白粳各升一百五六十元，二市塲到貨共計六千一百四十三石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>轉漲，老車兵船又出五百元關外，由於米價及業外物價報升，銀根稍寬，市乃轉挺。老車粉開盤卽出五百元，為五百〇五元，後更步升至五百十五元收市，計升六十二元。兵船粉收市五百〇四元，挺六十六元。紅蜂，建成粉各軋升六十五元，雜牌粉漲六七十元。大包麩皮勁漲五十八元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>向榮，黃豆挺升百元，漢口乍豆多日未開，昨以九百元開出。揀靑漲一百五十元，收市回疲。苞米獨吿下跌，因靑島價疲，客帮不納，收市價跌五十元。紅糧內地銷路尙佳，漲起五十元。菉豆粉廠去化，挺升百元。元麥漲七八十元，芝蔴挺二百及二百五十元。生仁貨主亦扳挺二百至三百元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>挺升，由於黑市金價之轉昻，銀根稍寬，貨主扳高，豆油初開四千六百元，最高曾至四千九百元，收市為四千八百元，較上日挺升六百元。生菜油由四千四百元升至西千六百，收市為四千六百元，挺五百五十元。吉桶生油跨越五千元外，做五千三百元，漲五百元。小車蔴油價格最低，僅以三千九百元收市，漲四百元。豆餅實銷呆滯，多為散戶交易，價挺三四十元。長字餅收市三百六十元。</p>
<h3>茶市漲風難遏</h3>
<p>茶市自連日蒸蒸直上後，昨仍俏俐不餒，綠因市上頭寸雖未寬裕，而同業心思猶受圈外物價踴騰之培養。加以茶存涸枯及複製成本尙難抑低，故售意依然堅化，喊價再度翱翔，趨勢遂吿迭挺，綜觀此種情形，售價之漲風，暫時恐難挽回。至查交易，則因進方頗難順利所欲，做開猶屬狹隘。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕法輪曼杜號，昨晨離滬返法，有大批茶葉運去，計一萬四千五百餘箱，合二千四百噸，運往北菲喀薩帛倫加。另有絲頭二十四包，運往馬賽。</p>
<h3>桐油走勢俏利</h3>
<p>桐油昨市：開後卽因銀根轉鬆，各物報漲，又將人心誘入挺途，趨勢俏俐非凡。迨後頭寸復緊，同業大受威脅，過程漸吿回平，收市結果，多與隔日相仿，但底盤比前鞏固。</p>

<h3>新汕林力三星</h3>
<p>結果一比零</p>
<p>新仙林足球隊昨以一比零力挫三星，造成五勝一和之戰績，因天氣晴和，前往南市觀賽者近千人，三星開球先攻，在十分鐘內失去機會兩次，旋新仙林突吿勢盛，向三星壓迫，亦以無隙可乘，未能產生戰果。相持約二十分鐘，新仙林鋒綫挺進，球從右邊由費冠華勾中，被費春華搭住，幾番盤旋，傳送陸慶祥，陸再傳蕭子文，蕭拔起一脚，應聲入網，新仙林卽以一球佔優勢。休息後，易位再戰，新仙林攻勢仍盛，但三星防守嚴密，踢來未有錯池，下半時未有紀錄，結果仍爲一比零。雙方出塲陣綫如下：</p>

<p>編輯先生：時代的殘酷無情，把我有生廿餘年來淚不輕洒頭不輕低的個性，變爲一籌莫展，無能爲力的柔弱女子。記得在學校讀歷史聽故事時，我卽對所謂花木蘭，秦良玉，沈雲英等的奇女奇事，深深的印在心頭，一個鮮麗而光彩奪目的美夢，時常繚繞在我的腦際，以待着大好時機的到來。巧的很，當我十五歲那年，神聖的民族抗戰爆發了，我的美麗的好夢實現了，我脫去裙衫，改扮了男裝，在大風雨將要降臨故鄉鄭州的前夕，我拋却了溫暖的家庭，慈祥的父母，與一羣小小的伙伴踏上了征程，舉凡合兒莊之役，徐州大會戰以及長沙大火，我幾無役不與，每於驚濤駭浪中，馳騁沙塲，我恨未能手刃敵奴，然而我確盡到了中華兒女的本分。我足跡踏遍了魯，豫，湘，鄂，贛，桂，及四川而輾轉到了大西北，且仍從事抗敵後援工作，長達四年之久，餐風露宿，騎馬打槍，都充實了我這小小的人生，就在這時我的生活又有一個極大的轉變，就是我追求了另一個人生，而結婚，而生子，在我的七年廚房生活中，有我的快樂，也有我不少的煩苦，然而我相信我又能善盡我所謂「內助」的職責。然而因爲我們的負担奇重，所以七八年來始終在不堪溫飽的水平綫下掙扎，不幸辛酸的歲月，茫無涯際，悲慘的侖運，步步追逐着國家，也追逐着我們。今年夏季，故鄕淪陷，拖兒帶女，流亡江南，舉目無吿，且以素無積蓄，開始遭受着人間的磨難。在那三個月賦閒中，日食一餐者有之，三日不能舉火者有之，兒女啼饑之聲，震碎了我的心弦。在這時眞使我淚不輕洒的女子，也常於夜闌人靜中，以淚洗面，不能自已，所幸天無絕人之路，我們終在這茫茫大海中，找到一綫生機，這樣又使我們的流亡生活安定了幾月，那能想到兩淮一戰，首都動　，我們這僅有的飯碗，又被遺無情的暴風吹破了！（未完）</p>

<h3>常州縣政停擺　新縣長未到任</h3>
<p>〔本報武進十一日訊〕本邑縣長自駱東藩辭職赴京任市民政局長，新縣長吳之霖，經省府會議通過發表，已十餘日，吳氏何日來任，縣府迄無消息。縣府前任科秘返待交卸，連電省府促駕，亦無下文。省會訊：民廳亦未見該新縣長赴人事室報到，並不知渠之通訊處，曾以派令專送丁主席官邸轉，亦經退回。民廳人事室和省副官處正派員四處找尋中。現縣府地政局田糧處，主管均辭職邀准，各科室靜候移交，致縣政停擺。</p>
<p>擁塞了的浙贛路　本報記者　蔣風　〔本報金華八日訊〕橫貫浙贛湘三省的浙贛鐵路，終於在徐蚌戰起之前趕修好贛江便橋而全綫貫通了，這條東南的交通命脈又再一次担負起軍事上與疏運上雙重的責任。</p>
<p>最近一個多月以來，浙贛綫的行車密度，驟然增加了數倍。在先天不足的情况下，顯得有些擁塞的狀態。最初，成千成萬的流亡學生，自中原各個角落湧向京滬一帶，再循浙贛綫分送浙贛湘三省設校安頓，有一段時間，浙贛路爲疏運豫。魯。蘇。皖。四省的流亡學生，曾經停開三·四·五·六·七·八·四一·四二各次客貨列車，將全部車底撥運流亡學生，有時甚至連一·二次特快車上，也加掛了疏散學生的專車。足足一個月，才把二萬多流亡學生疏運工作吿一段落。</p>
<p>接着，徐蚌戰事吿緊，南京大小機關，忙着疏散眷屬，除部分循海空二綫南行外，大部分的卷屬，行李，一齊湧向浙贛綫，過軌去株州，再轉車去衡陽，桂林，廣州，香港，每天在浙贛綫上向西南馳行的全是疏散專車，通常客貨列車幾乎宣吿絕跡。</p>
<p>同時，隴海津浦淮南江南四條鐵路綫，也因戰事影響，忙着向西南疏散員工，家屬，物資，案卷，於是各鐵路自己的疏運專車，也一列地向浙贛鐵路過軌，轉向西南各地。</p>
<p>浙贛綫修復不久，本身車底極度缺乏，大部分車皮撥往疏散公務員眷屬，流亡學生及軍運，因此本綫的客貨運輸幾陷入攤瘓狀態。每天原有的客貨運，都擠塞在僅有而且偶然開行的幾次客貨列車上，往往會在起點站，等上三數天，而上不了車的。</p>
<p>因爲車行的陷入半停頓狀態，浙贛沿綫各城市的物價就呈現不平衡，造成了單帮客活躍的機會。各班列車上，都擁滿了「單帮客」。從西行的香烟。布疋。洋火。肥皂。棉织品等洋廣百貨，到北上的鷄。鴨。豬肉。冬筍。橘子等土產，五花八門，雜陳在車背，車頂上，或擁塞在車箱裏，這樣，更增加了浙贛綫七擁擠紊亂的程度。</p>
<p>就這樣，剛復原的浙贛路，因遭戰事的影響而車行密度驟然增加。但是，一切設備却還極度簡陋，比方有的小站因爲股道不够，有一列車爲某種特殊情况拋錨，往往使上下行列車全不得過往。又如金華站，已敷设有七股道，在通常浙贛路本身的行車密度論，已經足够應付了，但是，因爲疏散列車過軌停留在站的，常常塞滿每一股岔道，而使上行下行的列車扣在兩端的前方站，等等數小時，俟調空出股道，方可進站。</p>
<p>還有一個原因，使浙贛綫擁塞程度加深的，就是該路全綫行車動力，全賴遠在西端的萍煤供給東端的列車，要靠遠在千餘公里外的萍煤推動。因此，常常緩不濟急。例如：在金華站，有一天就有五次西行列車同時停留在站，等候東開的煤東之煤。據該路其車務負責人吿知記者：該路的運煤專車，有時常會被不明事理的軍人截扣，强制載運他種物品或軍運，因此，全綫各加煤站在煤的供應上受到了嚴重影響，牽累全綫行車癱瘓症的加深。</p>
<p>記者最近曾在浙贛綫東段來回跑了一趟，看看車箱內容之擁擠和秩序之混亂，眞有些像二十六年逃難的情景。日夜有千萬旅客和堆積如山的行李在等候列車，只要有車就擠，擠滿了就開，年靑力壯的，或者握有槍桿的就佔盡了便宜。車箱里，除擠滿了人之外，更多的是箱籠行李，鍋灶，飯具，桌椅，沙發，甚至於搖籃，馬桶……形形色色，狼藉擁塞。車門過道，全然阻塞，上得了車，就不一定下得了車，車窗的迭被打破，幾乎形成了上車下車者的方便之門。</p>
<p>據說，浙贛路當局化盡了心思在想法改善，使行車秩序恢復正常，希望這混亂擁塞的情况，短期內就能全部消除。</p>
<h3>清華園戰一晝夜　校內幸落砲彈</h3>
<p>〔天津十日航訊〕此次戰事發生，校園附近曾作戰一畫夜，惟校中未落砲彈，且因守衛森嚴，亦未遭受搶刦，現已成眞空地帶。上月廿日確曾有飛機一度飛往投彈共九枚，一枚落工字廳前小橋旁，一枚落西院北公路上，其餘七枚均落空地，幸未傷人，亦未中校舍。校中員工同學全體安全，至今並未再有飛機前往投彈。九日起，開始放寒假，存糧可敷三月之用，生活無問題。城鄉間郵電早斷，匯款亦不通。隔絕在城內之人數亦不少，計有敎職員及眷屬百餘家，同學二百餘人，統由敎職員聯絡會負責解決各項問題。</p>
<h3>嘉桐路客車　覆車戰禍　死二傷廿四</h3>
<p>〔本報嘉興十一日訊〕嘉桐路汽車一輛，於十日下午由嘉興赴桐鄕，突在中途覆車，旅客二人當塲斃命，受傷者廿四人，六人倖免於難。茲悉：傾覆之客車，爲一三〇〇號，原爲司機李幼海駕駛，因臨時生病，改由李四寳司機駕駛，當車行至七號洋橋（離禾城約七公里）時，該橋全部泥塡，數日來天寒地凍，泥面因受陽光而疏鬆，車抵橋面，前輪蹈入，車身傾側，一時駕駛者無法控制，致車身翻入離橋面八尺高之水田內，造成此一慘劇。</p>
<h3>香港的泡沫</h3>
<p>— 謝銘新</p>
<p>〔香港十一日航訊〕寒流襲來，上海天氣已冷到零度以下了，香港尙在四五十度左右，可是住在香港的人，却已感受到出奇的冷。</p>
<p>過去，香港尙不失爲一個政治重心，沈鈞儒。蔡廷鍇。章伯鈞等「民主人士」北上於前，最近李濟琛。茅盾。施復亮等於去年聖誕左右又相率離港，粵主席宋子文也不再來港度歲了。剩下來的人，祗有「吿假」的龍雲，和中共一些二三流的人物，因此今天的香港不再是一個中國外綠政治的中心了。</p>
<p>由於政治重心的轉移，香港居民對「和談」的可能性，不期而然的一致看淡。在香港也有一二個由一些無聊的政治棍徒組成的小黨（如中國獨立民主黨等），到處招搖，發宣言，印小册子，招待記者，準備對「新政協」作一項無聊的投資，如今這種投機買賣顯已落空了，這是政潮中的一個小泡沫。</p>
<p>台省易主了。前省主席魏道明夫人，鄭毓秀女士，搭盛京輸於九日抵港，携帶行李達百餘件。</p>
<p>由國內來港的人，雖說一天多似一天，可是商塲不景氣的現象，却正瀰漫全島，儘管街上行人擁擠不堪，可是店舖的營業却蕭條異常。做進出口行的商人，老是在歎苦經，物價一天貶似一天，售價不够訂貨成本的事，數見不鮮，原因是國內戰亂不已，市塲納胃日趨狹隘，訂貨多，銷貨滯，大家在怕年關（陰曆）的迫臨。本報特約記者</p>
<h3>肥城今昔</h3>
<p>— 三報特約記者　費超然</p>
<p>〔本報合肥七日訊〕勝利後省府翩然而來，合肥如枯木逢春，百花怒放，刧後破碎的古城，一躍爲皖省政治軍事的中心都會，人口驟然大量地增加。三年來，市面日漸繁榮百業日趨發達，可是一切物價，因消費太大，却隨之不斷高漲，最幸運的商人，什九都笑逐顏開，年年大發財源，茶館·酒樓·旅店·浴堂，日日都吿客滿，房荒也隨之日日嚴重，家家房主，奇貨自居，十字街西，府學。兩菜市塲。每晨擠滿了衣香鬢影，御駕親征，採購米草油鹽，魚肉蔬菜，家庭日用品的摩登太太，臉打腫了充胖子，高價滿不在乎。卅七年春，又開始建築新合肥，刻已完成大半，是够了小都市的條件。在此如火如荼的當兒，不料霹靂一聲，省府及各廳處，於三十七年十二月二十日，突然遷回了安慶，在「人才下鄕」聲中，疏散到六十四縣市各角落的公務員，及卷屬，如潮水一般，分途流出，合肥市面，頓然感到門前冷落車馬稀的况味。記者特就現狀呵凍，報導如左：</p>
<p>省府遷後　百業凋敝</p>
<p>合肥市面生意，據詳細調查：獨資經營者，只有十餘家，其餘都爲集腋成表的股東生意，批發較少，零售特多，唯一主顧，多爲消費者的公敎人員，及眷屬，於是公敎人員日以瘦，商工份子日以肥，自上年底，一般對象走了，零市生意，一落千丈，加之家家改建門面，剜肉醫疳，花了鉅大的建築費，時局動盪，又影響了金九銀十的茂盛生意，合肥各銀行，錢莊，同時又疏散停業，無法週轉，大量運銷，支出浩繁，收益有限，所以到現在，除資本雄厚的少數商號，稍有盈餘，其餘一賬算來，都有蝕本之虞，明春五洋生意，關門大吉者，恐不在少數，最近已倒閉遷移者，有軍服店，照相館，印刷店，理髮店數十家，市面發現一片不景氣，令人油然生今昔之感，就是十字街西，府學，兩菜市塲，外籍摩登太太們，芳蹤亦吿絕跡，米草油鹽，魚肉蔬菜，各日用品價，亦無法瘋狂上漲，轉爲升斗小民之福。</p>

In order to adapt to the current situation, the National Army has recently adjusted its deployment and has proactively abandoned the strongholds north of Lai'an, including Guchengzhen, Baoshanji, and Banta Ji, which were recovered in the sweeping operations east of the railway in the past ten days, as well as Hongxinpu northeast of Dingyuan and Outang and Jiejipu southeast of the railway, in order to concentrate forces to ensure the safety of traffic between Bengbu and Pukou. Therefore, transportation on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway remains smooth. All county towns on both sides of the railway, including Tianchang, Liuhe, Lai'an, Jiashan, Fengyang, Hexian, Quanjiao, Chuxian, and Dingyuan, are under the control of the National Army. According to a certain authoritative military observer, after Du's forces broke through, the twelve bandit columns originally used to encircle his forces, after a short period of reorganization and replenishment, may send a portion to join with a portion of Lin Biao's bandits to invade central China, while another portion will invade Bengbu, Hefei, and Gaoyou, Yangzhou, and other places in northern Jiangsu in three routes. However, the National Army has already anticipated the enemy's intentions and completed a thorough deployment.</p>
<p>[Our Chuxian Dispatch, 12th] It is reported that Liu Bocheng's bandit troops have suffered heavy losses and have been transferred to central China for rest and replenishment.

<h3>Gu Ambassador Appeals to the International Community for Assistance in Stopping the War; Otherwise, It Will Eventually Endanger World Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 11th] The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, appealed on the evening of the 11th for international assistance to stop the civil war in China. In a speech accepting the Hamilton Award from Columbia University, Gu stated: "The situation in China can be used as a test of cooperation among major powers." The Hamilton Award is given to alumni or faculty members who have excelled and achieved distinction in any aspect of human endeavor, and Gu is an alumnus of the university. He stated: "Unlike the Berlin problem, no major power has openly sided with one party in the Chinese civil war. They are all free to participate in efforts to mediate and stop the war as soon as possible. This war has been delayed for too long, and if it is not resolved by immediate agreement, it will eventually endanger world peace. The leaders of international communism are realists. When free nations increasingly have a consistent and firm determination to protect their freedom and their way of life, the communists may realize that their dreams of controlling the world have become ineffective and recognize that free nations have the right to coexist with communist regimes. If this is the case, diplomats will have a better and clearer chance of success through meetings or by finding ways to resolve the major disputes that are currently dividing the major powers. It can be reasonably assumed that neither side truly hopes for war or advocates resorting to force. If this assumption is correct, then the situation in China can be used as a touchstone for testing cooperation among major powers. China is the key to Asia. For the sake of maintaining world peace, all countries that sincerely advocate peace should do their utmost to assist the Chinese government in its efforts to resolve the Chinese war. The outcome of the Chinese conflict can determine the shape of things to come. If the CCP is not an instrument of international communism, but a true Chinese patriot, and loves the freedom and sovereignty of China as much as its compatriots, and if the CCP truly desires the happiness of the Chinese people, as they have always claimed, then the CCP cannot completely ignore peace proposals. If the CCP is truly like this, then they cannot shirk the full responsibility for the continuation of the war in China."</p>
<p>Gu also said that China is a "major battlefield in the world's fight against aggressive communism." He briefly listed the world's tense situations, saying that the Berlin crisis is just one of them, and Korea is another. "In addition to the Cold War, there are actual wars in China, Greece, and the Middle East." Gu continued: "Armed conflicts and military operations are taking place in several countries in Southeast Asia, especially in Malaya and Indonesia." He pointed out that the inherent causes of these disputes clearly show that international communism has the ambition to realize a world revolution and establish a communist world.</p>
<p>Before Gu Weijun called for a diplomatic solution to the Chinese civil war, Nanjing telecommunications said that the Chinese government had requested the assistance of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in possible peace talks between the KMT and the CCP.</p>
<h3>U.S. Announces Receipt of Documents from Us Regarding the War Situation</h3>
<p>Nanjing Officials Deny That Britain Has Replied</p>

The reporter then asked him whether the document was related to China's recent document on the</p>
<h3>Stories of Brave Air Force Pilots Taking Risks; Escaping the Jaws of Death with Shoe Heel Fake Stamps</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Air Force pilots supporting ground army combat have produced a series of stories of self-sacrifice and risk-taking.</p>
<p>(1) Ke Tengjiao, a pilot of Fujian origin from the Philippines, was forced to land in the bandit阵(zhèn) after his plane was shot down near Xuzhou and was captured and taken to the vicinity of Yanzhou. He calculated that it would take five days to reach the National Army area, so he secretly left two steamed buns under a stone by the river every day under the supervision of the bandits. After four days, he went to check, but all the buns were gone. He knew that the bandits were closely watching him. After a few days, he saved four more buns and escaped from the toilet hole while going to the toilet and fled south. He hid in graves during the day and ran south by observing the stars at night. After five days, he managed to reach the defense area with the support of four buns without disturbing any bandit-occupied villages.</p>
<p>(2) The son of the famous athlete Ma John, who was captured in the same area as the above-mentioned Ke Tengjiao. He was shot down and parachuted into the bandit army in northern Jiangsu and captured. He has now also escaped and returned.</p>
<p>(3) Li Lenian, a paratrooper who was captured in the Xi'an war zone, escaped danger with a piece of rubber from his shoe. He usually liked to engrave seals, so he used a small knife to engrave Peng Dehuai's name and rank on the rubber heel of his shoe, creating a fake mission certificate. He crossed the Huanglong Mountains and returned south. With this fake certificate, he also rescued an army regimental commander who had been captured. The transmission is related to inviting the United States and other countries to mediate the KMT-CCP war. Luo did not respond.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] Qualified officials denied on the 12th reports that Britain had already responded to the Chinese government's invitation to mediate the civil war.</p>
<h3>Government Agency Staff and Official Documents; Decide to Step up Evacuation</h3>
<p>Office Expenses Adjusted Starting This Month</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] It is learned that the government meeting on the morning of the 12th discussed the evacuation methods for government agencies and schools threatened by war.

Moreover, it was decided that office expenses for government agencies will be adjusted starting in January. Expenses for civilian agencies will be increased sevenfold compared to December, and expenses for military agencies will be increased fivefold compared to December. The decision was approved.</p>

<p>The Establishment of a Ceasefire Agreement Is Not Accurate</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 12th] The Tianjin City Council called for a ceasefire. Four representatives, including Ding Zuoshao, went to the Communist area again on the 11th. After meeting with their responsible person, they returned to Tianjin at 2:00 PM on the 12th. It is learned that the discussions have made progress. When Ding and others will go again depends on the discussions with all parties in Tianjin.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch] A dispatch from Tianjin said that the Tianjin garrison has rejected the three demands of the Communist side, but said that if the National Army is allowed to "withdraw to Tanggu with light weapons," they are willing to give up the city. About sixteen ships are now on the sea near Tanggu, waiting to carry 60,000 National Army troops to evacuate. It is reported that the three demands of the Communist side are: The National Army in the city must lay down their weapons, all weapons must be handed over to the Communist side, and the lives of the National Army that accept the above conditions will be guaranteed safe. The situation in Tianjin is still unclear. It is widely believed that under the people's hope for peace, the withdrawal of the National Army will eventually be unavoidable.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] A spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense said: The statement that a Tianjin ceasefire agreement has been reached is not accurate.</p>
<h3>Beiping Secondary Education Federation; Appeals to Save Beiping and Tianjin</h3>

<h3>Zhang Qun Officially Dispels Rumors in Nanjing; Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian's Attitudes Are Open and Upright, Completely Consistent with the Central Government's Current Policies</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chengdu, 12th] At the political affairs meeting on the morning of the 12th, Political Committee Member Zhang Qun reported on his recent trip to Central China. Zhang stated that various rumors circulating about Central China were proven absolutely untrue after his personal meetings with Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian. Their opinions are entirely consistent with those of the Central Government. Bai even stated "prepare for war to seek peace," which aligns with the President's intention to be capable of both war and peace. Furthermore, the matter of Zhang's re-visit to Wuhan has been decided to be temporarily postponed.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 12th] Zhang Qun formally denied the United Press Nanjing dispatch of the 11th, which alleged that he was conveying Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian's demands for President Chiang's resignation and transfer of all power. He stated that the matter was purely a rumor, completely unfounded. Bai and Cheng made no such demands.

Bai also stated that he would formally deny the claims in Wuhan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] On the morning of the 12th, an English newspaper in Shanghai published a dispatch from United Press Beijing correspondent Zhang Guo on the 11th, stating: "According to the most reliable sources, during Secretary-General Zhang Qun's visit to Wuhan and Changsha to visit Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi and Director Cheng Qian, Bai and Cheng presented the President with a written document akin to an ultimatum, requesting his immediate resignation, etc." A Central News Agency reporter specifically questioned Secretary-General Zhang Qun about this news. Zhang replied with great surprise, stating: "This is an unfounded rumor, clearly containing malicious attempts to sow discord between the President and senior generals, even shaking the morale of troops at the front and confusing public opinion." Secretary-General Zhang Qun further told the reporter: "During my visit to Wuhan and Changsha, I had extensive talks with Bai and Cheng. Their views on the current situation were very pure and far-sighted, loyal and patriotic, and highly admirable. Since the defeat in the Huaihai Campaign, the situation in Central China has naturally become tense. Although the military authorities are actively preparing for war and have made meticulous arrangements, the local people still feel uneasy. This kind of emotion is very common. Bai and Cheng are determined to adhere to the policy of only preparing for war to seek peace and not forgetting war while talking about peace. Furthermore, they strongly advocate that unity from top to bottom and throughout the country is essential for any solution, whether for peace or war. The attitudes of the two gentlemen are very open and upright, and there is no difference between them and the Central Government's current policies. This has already been proven by facts, without the need for further explanation."</p>

<h3>Actively Constructing the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway</h3>
<p>In today's war-torn times, we are pleased to hear news of construction: the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is currently under active construction. This is indeed a welcome sound in a desolate valley. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has experienced many twists and turns and unexpected obstacles since its reconstruction began in October 1946, almost leading to the cessation of the project midway. Thanks to the efforts of the local authorities in Sichuan Province and the support of the Ministry of Communications, the road construction was able to continue. Previous rumors that the road had no funds from January of this year have been denied by the authorities. According to recent reliable information, the national general budget for this year has incorporated the required domestic and foreign funds for the road's three-year completion plan into the budget expenditure. The Ministry of Communications is continuing to allocate funds based on this budget. Not only has the road construction not been halted, but it is also possible to complete it ahead of schedule. This is fortunate for Sichuan and marks a new era in the unified transportation of the Southwest. We are very pleased to hear this news of peaceful construction!</p>
<p>Sichuan is known as the "Land of Abundance," with a large population and abundant resources. However, within its 404,000 square kilometer area, the lack of a railway connection has affected various construction projects, which is indeed a regrettable matter. The people of Sichuan took the lead in starting the revolution in the late Qing Dynasty for the railway issue, leading to the Xinhai Revolution. In the eyes of the people of Sichuan, the railway is the hub of all economic and cultural activities and the nerve center for the survival and development of 70 million people. The people of Sichuan have been looking forward to having a railway.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, when the national government was in Chongqing, the wartime capital, it planned to resume the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, but it was suspended halfway due to a lack of materials and funds. After the victory and return to peace, Chairman Chiang, in his farewell message to the people of Sichuan, affirmed that he was determined to build a railway for Sichuan Province and instructed the Ministry of Communications to complete the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway within two years, with 26 billion yuan allocated from the national treasury. At that time, the people of Sichuan were excited when they heard this. Unexpectedly, in 1946, there was no news of the allocation of funds, and the people of Sichuan felt disappointed. Last year, the Ministry of Communications included the construction cost of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in the budget, which was approved to be 40 billion yuan, 14 billion yuan higher than the estimate in 1946. Despite the continuous progress of the road construction, the project almost came to a standstill due to the lack of materials and insufficient funds. The authorities of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Construction, in desperation, negotiated a loan with a French banking group and achieved considerable results. The people of Sichuan realized that raising foreign debt to build the railway might harm national interests and mostly expressed their disapproval. They yearned for the state to include the construction cost of the road in the budget or requested the central government to return 1 million dan of grain from Sichuan Province to offset the cost, using the money and grain of the people of Sichuan to build roads in Sichuan. The transportation authorities agreed in principle, but their determination and willpower were not enough, resulting in many twists and turns and setbacks. The road's bridge, tunnel, and earthwork projects have only been completed by half so far, and the completion date is still quite far away.</p>
<p>According to the blueprint of November 1946, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is 520 kilometers long, starting from Wuhou Temple in Chengdu and ending at Jiulongpo in Chongqing. The route passes through areas with developed industries and abundant agricultural raw materials, which will undoubtedly help Sichuan's construction. In order to cooperate with Sichuan's construction plan, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Bureau re-formulated a three-year completion plan last year, aiming to actively expedite the completion. In the first year (fiscal year), from 1948 to June 1949, the road surface engineering from Chongqing to Yongchuan will be completed. After the rails and sleepers purchased from the United States are shipped to Chongqing this year, they will be laid immediately to Zhuyangxi, and the road will be open to traffic by the end of the year. In the second year (from July this year to June 1950), the road will be open to Neijiang. In the third year (from July 1950 to June 1951), the entire line will be open to traffic. If the foreign exchange for purchasing materials can be allocated quickly and the project is quickly approved, the entire line can be opened to traffic by the end of 1950, shortening the time by half a year. Recently, the road construction has been progressing actively. If there are no more obstacles midway, it is entirely possible that the entire line will be open to traffic in July next year.</p>
<p>The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway during this extraordinary period is of great significance. The help of the road construction for construction is needless to say. For the psychology of the people of Sichuan, will inevitably have great comfort and encouragement. From the process of the anti-Japanese war, Sichuan has made great contributions to the country and the nation. Without Sichuan, China would not have been able to persist in the anti-Japanese war for eight years. Today, the troops defending the Yangtze River and the Yellow River on the Huaihai battlefield are mostly strong men from Sichuan, which shows that in the ten years of the anti-Japanese war, without the loyal cooperation of the people of Sichuan, the rear could not have been so stable. The only yearning of the people of Sichuan is this railway. They have no extravagant demands, and the country should not fail them.</p>
<p>Now that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is under active construction and its opening to traffic is imminent, all compatriots in the country and the people of Sichuan are eager to see it completed as soon as possible and will strive to develop it in the future, so that the railway's blood can be sublimated to the highest point!</p>

<h3>Adjustment of Salaries for Public School Teachers and Civil Servants: Abolition of Zonal Surcharges</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The salaries of central government civil and military officials and teachers were approved by the Executive Yuan at its 34th meeting on the 8th and will be adjusted starting this month. The payment standards for each zone have also been announced. The main difference between these new standards and the salary calculation methods of November and December last year is the abolition of the zonal surcharge method. Except for the different payment standard multipliers in each zone, the calculation method has not changed. Taking Nanchang in the third zone as an example, if a civil servant's base salary is 400 yuan, their actual income calculated using the new standard will be 1,770 yuan. The calculation method can be explained as follows: (1) The initial base is 60 yuan. (2) 20% of the 240 yuan from 61 yuan to 300 yuan. (3) 10% of the 100 yuan from 301 yuan to 400 yuan. The sum of these three items (1), (2), and (3) is then multiplied by the payment standard multiplier of 15 for Nanchang in the third zone, which is the 1,770 yuan to be received.</p>

The township (town/district) head serves concurrently as the group leader. (2) Bao Direct Group - Composed of solid and reliable families in the entire bao as group members, with the number selected being equal to the number of "jia" (a subunit of "bao") under their jurisdiction. The bao head serves concurrently as the group leader. (3) Each jia is divided into three subgroups, with each subgroup having at least three members. If there are fewer than three, it should be combined with a neighboring jia. First Subgroup - Composed of family members of soldiers serving in the military (excluding wealthy families). Second Subgroup - Composed of conscripted soldiers from the team. Third Subgroup - Composed of able-bodied men aged 18 to 45 from families without soldiers serving in the military, but wealthy families, regardless of whether they have soldiers serving in the military or able-bodied men, should be members of this subgroup, except for those already selected as members of the township, town, or district direct group. For each of the subgroups listed above, the members shall publicly elect one person to be the group leader.</p>
<p>11. The county (city) mutual aid groups for military service should use the jia as the practical unit and the bao as the implementing unit for mutual aid to the families of soldiers. The bao direct group should contribute as much manpower and resources as possible, bearing at least one-fifth of the total amount of mutual aid for the entire bao to subsidize impoverished families. The township (town/district) serves as the command unit and should contribute as much manpower and resources as possible from the township (town/district) direct group, bearing at least one-tenth of the total amount of mutual aid for the entire county (town/district) to subsidize impoverished bao. The county (city) serves as the planning and supervision unit and should utilize all possible preferential treatment funds to handle overall relief and preferential treatment. If there is a military service association, it should assist or be responsible for handling these matters.</p>
<p>12. The standards for mutual aid to the families of soldiers are as follows: (1) Families with ample means or the ability to support themselves independently are exempt from mutual aid. (2) Families with sufficient land to cultivate but lacking manpower should be provided with volunteer assistance for cultivation. (3) Families without land to cultivate and without the ability to engage in industry and commerce, or whose income from industry and commerce is insufficient to maintain their livelihood, should be provided with material relief. (4) Families with very little land should be provided with both volunteer cultivation and material relief. The minimum requirement for mutual aid to the families of soldiers is to maintain their food, clothing, and shelter to prevent them from freezing and starving. Generally, the standard is 150 labor days per year for each soldier serving in the military. Those in need of material relief should also be provided with the equivalent in labor wages or rice based on the local prevailing rates, but the amount should be adjusted based on their actual needs. Mutual aid for households in urban bao should be handled according to the above provisions. Mutual aid for the families of soldiers in fortified units should be handled according to Article 18 of the Conscription Regulations during the Suppression of Rebellion.</p>
<p>13. The implementation procedures for volunteer cultivation are as follows: (1) At the beginning of each year, the first subgroup of each jia under each bao should submit the number of labor days needed by each member requiring assistance. The bao head should convene all the group leaders and members of each jia to review and decide on the number of labor days. (2) After review and decision, the manpower and resources of the bao direct group and the third subgroup of each jia should be assessed to determine the amount of labor days each should bear. The necessary plowing cattle, cultivators, and laborers should be assigned accordingly. (3) The timing of the volunteer labor should be determined by the member receiving the assistance. The members providing assistance should not delay or refuse on any pretext. The bao head and all the group leaders and members of the jia should jointly supervise and execute the cultivation through a division of labor. (4) If the member providing assistance is unable to provide labor due to unavoidable circumstances or if the residence of the person providing assistance and the person receiving assistance are far apart, making travel inconvenient, they should pay the local prevailing wage for a hired laborer to be used for hiring labor.

<h3>Israeli and Egyptian Representatives Arrive on Rhodes Island; Armistice Negotiations Begin Today; Britain and the Jews Accept US Advice to Exercise Restraint</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 12th - A broadcast from Rhodes Island reports that the Egyptian delegation has arrived here, preparing to negotiate the Palestinian armistice with Israeli authorities. The negotiations are scheduled to begin on the 13th, and the Israeli delegation is expected to arrive on the afternoon of the 12th.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] United Nations mediator Ralph Bunche, along with military observer group leader Riley, flew to Rhodes Island yesterday to preside over the Israeli-Egyptian armistice negotiations. An Israeli government spokesman said that Israeli forces have completely withdrawn from Egyptian territory.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Washington, 12th - A broadcast reports that Acting Secretary of State Lovett stated that the United States has formally advised Britain, Israel, and Egypt to exercise as much restraint as possible in the Middle East, so as not to adversely affect the opportunity for Egyptian peace talks. Lovett said that this advice was issued before the Israeli forces shot down five British planes, and the same advice was subsequently issued again, because the US military deeply hopes that the Holy Land can see peace again.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th] The United Nations today shelved Israel's complaint against Britain in order to pave the way for negotiations on a Palestinian armistice treaty. United Nations officials intend to temporarily refrain from responding to Israel's formal request for an investigation into British activities in the Middle East. Negotiations in the Holy Land have entered a delicate stage, and due to pressure from the United States and the United Nations, Israel's attitude has slightly softened and there is no continued vigorous action.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 11th] The government issued a statement tonight stating that world peace has been seriously threatened by the situation in Palestine. The United Nations Security Council has lost its power of control, and Israel is likely to violate the armistice order again in places like Jerusalem, attacking Jordanian or Iraqi forces. The Security Council should re-establish its prestige before a final resolution is reached, without any delay. The British Foreign Office is currently refraining from commenting on Israel's complaint against Britain to the Security Council, only stating that the government intends to exercise utmost patience so as not to hinder the success of the armistice negotiations between Egypt and Israel.</p>

The British cabinet held its first full meeting since Christmas today, and Foreign Secretary Bevin reported on the situation in the Holy Land and other international issues. It is understood that Britain, the United States, France and other countries have all obtained evidence of Czech military supplies being airlifted to Israel, but today is the first time that other Eastern Bloc countries have been mentioned. When asked whether the Soviet Union had supplied Israel with military supplies, the Foreign Office spokesman replied that the countries supplying military supplies other than Czechoslovakia could not be disclosed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 12th] Foreign Secretary Bevin reported to the cabinet today on the Palestinian crisis and other international issues, including the proposed North Atlantic Treaty, the European Recovery Program, and the German question. On the Palestine issue, Bevin appears to be the target of much criticism. Some Labor Party members have criticized the handling of the Middle East crisis, and are also dissatisfied with the Foreign Office's formal review of the dispute. According to the Foreign Office, the latest developments are a serious threat to the peace and stability of the entire Middle East. Labor Party members were greatly displeased that Israel actually filed a complaint against Britain in the Security Council.</p>

<h3>We Advocate Taking Action on the Dutch-Indonesian Issue</h3>
<p>Chiang Ting-fu Speaks at the Security Council</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 11th] Dr. Chiang Ting-fu, the Chinese representative, made his first speech to the Security Council after returning from Paris, presenting three major requirements for a constructive solution to the Indonesian issue. He stated: At this stage, I do not intend to list the responsibilities of selling the Indonesian situation, but I would like to emphasize three major requirements for a constructive and concrete solution to this issue: (1) In order to implement the political principles of the Renville and Linggadjati agreements, the Indonesian people should be guaranteed genuine free and democratic elections; (2) Peace and order within Indonesia must be adequately guaranteed; (3) The Security Council should take more active measures in guaranteeing free and democratic elections and maintaining peace and order in the future.

<h3>The Netherlands Openly Violates Security Council Resolutions; US Representative Reprimands Back and Forth; Demands the Netherlands Establish a Free Indonesian Federation Soon</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 11th] The United States on the 11th condemned the Netherlands for "openly resisting" United Nations orders, and demanded that the Netherlands hold elections soon, establish a "genuinely free" Indonesian federation, and withdraw all Dutch troops in the East Indies within the recent months, and immediately release Indonesian leaders. US Representative Jessup reprimanded in the Security Council that the Soviet Union neither desires peace in Indonesia, nor the existence of the Republic of Indonesia, but only wants "an Indonesia controlled by a communist minority party instructed by Moscow."</p>
<p>Jessup pointed out that the Soviet Union's refusal to support the US proposal at the Paris conference, and the communist editorials pointing out that the Dutch police actions were a "punishment" for President Sukarno and Prime Minister Hatta's suppression of the communist rebellion in Madiun last year, all serve as clear evidence. But Jessup's most severe criticism was still directed at the Netherlands. He stated: "The Dutch authorities' refusal to immediately cease fire and their refusal to release Indonesian leaders, their failure to comply with the Security Council's orders, cannot be concealed by any excuses. The Dutch representative in the Security Council cannot absolve the Dutch government from the accusation that the Netherlands has violated the United Nations Charter." Jessup spoke with harsh words that the United States had never used against any country other than the Soviet Union in the United Nations, stating that according to the report of the Mediation Commission, it proves that the Netherlands' various activities, even before this military offensive, were aimed at subverting the Republic of Indonesia. He continued, stating that the Dutch policy not only caused "unnecessary suffering for the people," but also aimed at organizing "a pre-planned Indonesian government in which the Republican government did not participate." Jessup declared that the Netherlands will not be allowed to resolve its disputes with the Republic by force. On the contrary, the Netherlands must begin to sever the connection between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. Jessup was the first to speak at the Security Council meeting on the 11th. The meeting was adjourned today and is scheduled to resume on the 14th. Representatives from China, the Soviet Union, and other countries also spoke today.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Submits Request to Central Government to Adopt Improved Industrial Loan Recommendations</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a joint letter from twelve industrial trade associations, including machinery papermaking, leather manufacturing, and machinery cotton textile, stating that the government's current industrial loan methods have failed to avert the industrial loan crisis. They specifically proposed seven improved industrial loan recommendations, requesting that they be forwarded to the Executive Yuan and the Central Bank for prompt adoption. The Chamber believes that the seven improved industrial loan methods proposed are indeed necessary measures to rescue industry, and immediately sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Central Bank's Discount Committee, requesting their prompt adoption. The seven recommendations are as follows: (1) In addition to the stipulated finished products and raw materials, the scope of industrial loan collateral should be expanded to include factory buildings, land, machinery, and equipment, and commercial banks and firms should be allowed to re-mortgage or re-discount with the Central Bank. (2) The Central Bank's term for re-mortgaging industrial loans should be the same as the original term of the industrial loan from the forwarding bank or firm, without reduction, but may be limited to a maximum of three months per term, and each batch of industrial loan re-mortgages may be extended for one term. (3) If the Central Bank cannot extend a re-mortgaged industrial loan that has already been extended for one term, it may order the bank or firm to recover it, but the forwarding bank or firm shall not be liable for repayment. (4) The amount of each factory's industrial loan should be based on the total value of the three-month reserve of raw materials, supplies, and fuel required by the factory, and the total amount of wages and electricity expenses for one month, and should not be limited to 8% of the total deposits of the forwarding commercial bank or firm. (5) The targets of industrial loans should be reasonably broadened to include industries such as printing, box manufacturing, and tobacco factories. (6) Finished products produced by industrial loans that have been revived and reproduced should be allowed to be purchased by each factory on a monthly basis at cost price if sales are sluggish. (7) When factories in various industries require order loans, the actual needs should be carefully considered and loans should be granted for orders.</p>
<h3>Emergency Industrial Loans for Small Factories: Screening Committee to be Established Soon; Applications Can Be Accepted Starting Next Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The methods for small factories to request emergency industrial loans were previously drafted by the National Bank Discount Committee with three principles. Currently, detailed rules are being drafted and various forms are being rushed into print. According to Mr. Lin Chongyong, all preparatory work can be completed within this week, and applications can be accepted starting next week. The Loan Screening Committee will be established soon. In addition to the Discount Committee members, there will also be representatives from the industrial sector participating, responsible for reviewing loan applications. The nature of this loan will, in principle, adopt a credit loan system with a term of one month, without the need to mortgage machinery, finished products, or raw materials, to take into account the difficulties of small factories. The amount of the loan will be determined based on the number of workers actually engaged in production by each factory.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Transactions Still Stagnant; Empty House Transfer Fees Also Reduced</h3>

<h3>"It's the Fox Demon!" Everyone Looks at Each Other, Losing Color; Strange Fire at the Dazhong Bookstore, Police Bureau Investigates the Truth</h3>
<p>[Our News Report] At 8:15 PM last night, a pile of old Lingbao newspapers stored next to the escalator on the second floor of the Dazhong Bookstore at No. 230 Fuzhou Road suddenly caught fire.

As a result, more than a dozen employees residing in the store and neighbors discussed the matter, saying that it was caused by a fox demon, and they looked at each other in fear. However, according to personnel sent by the police bureau and fire department for investigation, the situation may be similar to the arson case that occurred at the Ye Shude Chinese Medicine Store on Xizang Nanlu last year. Therefore, last night, the police bureau summoned the store manager, Fan Jiangang, for investigation, and will summon all store employees today to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>The Mayor Has a Cold, Did Not Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu Guozhen was slightly ill with a cold and resting at his residence, and did not go to the city government office yesterday.

<h3>British Warship London to Depart; Cossack to Replace It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the British Information Office, the British cruiser London will leave Shanghai on January 17. In addition, the British destroyer squadron flagship Cossack has requested to sail to Shanghai for a visit. It is reported that the ship will replace the London and will be stationed here until February 3. Because the cost of building houses is expensive, materials are costly, and labor is also high, and it is difficult to collect funds, most of the housing construction projects that are underway have been suspended, so there are very few buyers of vacant land. It is reported that most of the buyers of vacant houses recently are clients from the north. It is also estimated that the transfer fees for general vacant houses have also decreased as real estate prices have fallen. However, since the Council decided to re-establish housing rental standards, transfer fees have slightly increased. The current value is about 70% or 80% of the normal market price before the currency reform.</p>
<h3>Deputy Manager of Qichang Bank Aided in Soliciting Bribes, Sentenced to Probation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wei Zhonghuai, the deputy manager of the Qichang Bank in the city, colluded with Xia Peide, an inspector of the Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau who is on the run, in a case of soliciting bribes from the impoverished. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang Yuanhou of the District Court concluded the trial and sentenced Wei Zhonghuai to one year and nine months in prison for assisting in requesting bribes in relation to official duties, with a three-year suspended sentence. In mid-July last year, the Financial Administration Bureau sent inspector Xia Peide to inspect the Qichang Bank's large loans for June and July and the reasons for overdue bill exchanges on July 12. After the inspection, Xia told Wei that there were many irregularities in the bank's accounts, and took the opportunity to request four gold bars as a reward to rewrite the inspection report. Wei negotiated this from the middle, but the bank's board of directors discovered it and reported it to the Financial Administration Bureau, which transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Unions Meet for Days to Discuss Demanding Improved Index Compilation Methods, Provide Advice to Authorities Several Times</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the price increases began at the end of last year, nearly a month has passed, and prices have risen almost daily during this month. However, the cost of living index for last December was only 18.3 times. Over one million industrial and vocational workers in the city whose salaries and wages are calculated based on the cost of living index have become alarmed. Labor unions have repeatedly requested the General Labor Union to revise the current method of calculating the index and to study remedies for the excessively low index of 18.3 times. Union leaders have met for days to discuss and have visited municipal leaders several times, providing three points of advice for improving index compilation: (1) The rent item in the current index is still based on the survey conducted in July last year. Labor unions have repeatedly requested a survey every three months, and the authorities agreed to a survey every six months. Even if six months is the period, the rent in the January index should be recalculated. (2) The priority rations of industrial and vocational workers, other than rice, such as oil, sugar, and coal briquettes, have long been nominal, and the index should no longer be calculated based on ration prices. The priority rice vouchers for this month have not yet been fully distributed, so all rice in the index should be calculated at market prices. (3) Prices have been rising sharply recently, and conducting price surveys twice a week is too infrequent. The frequency should be increased to three times a week, starting with the upper-period index for this month.</p>
<p>Remarks from Statistical Experts: Analyzing the Reasons for Disconnection</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter interviewed several private statistical experts with expertise in the cost of living index and summarized their opinions as follows: (1) The cost of living index salary calculation method itself is not very sound, especially in today's environment of vicious currency inflation and rapid currency depreciation, and it is even more unsuitable. Because the index only represents the comparison of living expenses between one period and another, it can still be used as a salary calculation standard when prices rise slowly and cyclically. However, prices are rising several times a day, and they often increase several times in ten days or half a month. The average number for this half month cannot be equated with prices, and it is difficult to obtain the equivalent value of the base salary when used for salary calculation. If the price increase trend continues, it is necessary to replace the index salary calculation with in-kind salary calculation. (2) The current base salary of workers is calculated by converting the index of 3.63 million times on August 13 last year into gold yuan. This index of 3.63 million times already differed by 25% from the actual prices on that day. Furthermore, the prices in the current index are based on the "August 19" limited price. The average price increase in the six days between August 13 and August 19 was another 60%. Therefore, the salary calculation value of the index after the liberalization of the limited price is different from the index before the currency reform. Under various accumulated factors, the distance between the index and prices will naturally become increasingly different.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Shutdown of Sandaliwan Resolved by Social Affairs Bureau Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the dispute over the shutdown of the Sandaliwan Restaurant on Nanjing Road due to the issue of year-end bonuses, the workers reported the situation to reporters yesterday, saying that they are demanding that the Social Affairs Bureau immediately order the employer to resume operations, that the employer bear the workers' losses during the shutdown, and that the year-end bonuses of two months be issued as usual. Yesterday afternoon, employer representative Zhang Zongyi also reported the situation of the dispute to the Social Affairs Bureau, claiming that the workers had implemented a large-scale treat due to the unresolved year-end bonus issue, changing from giving diners two pieces of ribs to six pieces, and from giving two pieces of bread to four pieces, causing the store to suffer losses to the point where it could not resume operations. After receiving the report, Shen Ding, director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, conducted persuasion and scheduled a meeting for the representatives of both labor and management to mediate at 10 AM today.</p>
<h3>Suspicion of Operating Over-the-Counter Securities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, police officers from the Economic Police Unit were ordered to go to various markets for surveillance. As a result, they discovered a suspect operating over-the-counter securities trading in Room 323 of the Securities Building. The person in charge of the room, Fan Jinkang (resident of No. 1693 Changzhi Road), was arrested on the spot. In addition to confiscating 600,000 shares of Yongshen stock, they also found US$25, one tael of gold, and a bundle of suspicious draft accounts on his person. After being taken to the police station, Fan was detained for interrogation due to the seriousness of the suspicion.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Will Be Adjusted at Any Time, But Will Not Be Implemented This Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] After the announcement of the method of adjusting urban ration grain prices at any time, fluctuations in household rice prices will be inevitable in the future. However, according to reporters from relevant departments, this new method will not be implemented this month due to various technical problems. The people from that department also told reporters that although cost prices will be an important factor in determining ration grain prices in the future, China and the United States will not adopt measures that simply follow market prices. It is inevitable that China and the United States will continue to subsidize losses. Judging from the past situation, the amount of subsidies from China and the United States often reached two-thirds of the selling price. Because the Chinese government is responsible for planning 60% of all rations, the amount of government subsidies is even greater. For example, in October last year, the government lost over 188.8 million gold yuan, while the United States lost 88 million gold yuan. If this continues, it will be difficult to maintain. After the new method is implemented, the losses of both parties can be reduced, and the recovery of grain payments will increase accordingly, ensuring the continued maintenance of the urban ration system.</p>
<h3>Standards for Tuition and Fees at Shanghai University and Soochow University Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Apart from St. John's, Datong, Shanghai University, and Soochow University, which started school early, the rest of the private universities and colleges in the city will have to start school in mid-February. The charging standards for St. John's and Datong have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the charging issues for Shanghai University and Soochow University have also been decided. Shanghai University started registration for the past two days and will start classes on the 17th. The tuition and fees standard is calculated based on 4.5 dan of rice. According to yesterday's report, the settlement is 1,250 yuan per dan, totaling 5,625 yuan, which is collected in one lump sum. Accommodation fees are charged according to the quality of the rooms, ranging from 6 dou to 1 shi of rice, and are also collected in one lump sum. Meal fees are collected for one month in advance, with each person paying 8 dou and 1 sheng. According to Sun Ruilin, Secretary-General of the university, this standard was determined after considering the burden on parents and the treatment of faculty and staff. The principle is to collect the fees in one lump sum. If parents have many children or civil servants cannot afford it, they can contact the Academic Affairs Office separately for installment payments.</p>
<p>Soochow University will register on the 17th, 18th, and 19th of this month, and classes will start on the 20th. This semester is divided into two terms, each lasting two months. Fee collection, registration procedures, and credit settlement are all handled in two terms. The first term's tuition and fees are based on a base amount of 48 yuan, calculated according to the cost of living index published on the 15th of this month.</p>

<h3>Dispute over Air Transportation of International Refugees; Far Eastern Airlines Concedes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the dispute between the six major airlines and the International Refugee Organization over the air transportation of international refugees, it was rumored that the International Refugee Organization had expressed its willingness to accept the companies' request to assist in transporting refugees. However, this is not true. The International Refugee Organization only replied to the companies that the lease of Far Eastern Airlines aircraft was decided by the Geneva headquarters and made no other statements. However, the Shanghai representative of Far Eastern Airlines, seeing that the matter had reached a stalemate, which was extremely detrimental to the company, has voluntarily offered to cede some passenger seats to the six major airlines. The two sides are currently negotiating, but have not reached a concrete agreement. On the other hand, the Civil Aviation Administration has approved the takeoff and landing of three aircraft from Far Eastern Airlines, which will carry over a hundred White Russians to the Philippines and Australia. Therefore, it is believed that this dispute can be resolved.</p>
<h3>Ward Chief Sentenced for Using Position to Defraud</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Shiyan, the ward chief of the seventh ward and the leader of the twenty-first jia in the Hongkou District of the city, was sentenced to one year and nine months in prison by the District Court yesterday for using his position to attempt to defraud. Peng Shurong, of the thirty-third household in the jia, moved in last year and registered his household. There were only two people, husband and wife. In order to facilitate the collection of rationed goods, he deposited a private seal with Chen and entrusted him to stamp on his behalf. Unexpectedly, Chen took the opportunity to falsely fill out Peng's registration application on September 9 last year, reporting his parents and siblings in addition to the household. After obtaining the ration cards, he kept all of them except for the two given to Peng. The police discovered this, and the case was transferred to the District Court for trial.</p>

In September 1936, Wang Chuxiong sent Jin Rongshou to Xiechang Auto Shop to investigate unpaid income tax. Xiechang had already closed down. Manager Fu Zhenfei was very worried when he heard that the bureau had sent someone to investigate, so he sold the house and paid a bribe of 80 million yuan to settle the matter. This money was divided up among the people listed above. In addition, Li Zumin also has adjustments.</p>

<h3>This Year's Municipal Government Budget Finalized by the Council Committee. Total Revenue Listed at Over 720 Million Yuan.</h3>
<p>The draft budget for the 38th year of the city, after being resolved by the eighth general meeting of the Municipal Council and amended and passed according to the review report of the Budget Committee, was finalized by the committee yesterday and will be sent to the Municipal Government for implementation. It is understood that the total revenue in the amended and passed general budget for the 38th year is listed as 727,307,158 gold yuan. This figure is an increase of 131,310,000 gold yuan compared to the original budget compiled by the Municipal Government, including an increase of 30 million gold yuan in land value tax, an increase of 90 million gold yuan in business tax, an increase of 5 million gold yuan in slaughter tax, an increase of 360,000 gold yuan in penalties for violations of police regulations, an increase of 450,000 gold yuan in police administrative fees, and an increase of 5.5 million gold yuan in revenue from cleaning services. It was also decided that the added revenue mentioned above, as well as any increases in tax revenue due to inflation, increases in various remuneration fees, and savings from the Municipal Government's consolidation of overlapping agencies and elimination of redundant personnel, should all be transferred to a reserve fund for adjusting employee salaries and increasing business expenses. Regarding the total expenditure, the review report made three recommendations: (1) The organizational regulations of the Municipal Government should be finalized as soon as possible. Before they are finalized, the Municipal Government should no longer establish new agencies or increase personnel to reduce expenditures. (2) Overlapping agencies should be effectively consolidated and redundant personnel eliminated. (3) In terms of construction, a focus policy should be adopted. Whether it be roads, bridges, houses, vehicles, or office equipment, projects that can be temporarily postponed should be delayed. Projects that must be carried out should be thoroughly constructed to achieve a permanent solution and avoid wasting public funds. In view of the difficult financial situation of the city in the future, the report concluded, "In order to prepare for a rainy day, since we cannot open up new taxes to increase the burden on citizens, we can only save on expenditures to achieve a near balance of revenue and expenditure."</p>
<p>Effectively Consolidate Overlapping Agencies</p>
<p>Regarding the recommendation in the review report to the Municipal Government to effectively consolidate overlapping agencies and eliminate redundant personnel, the report provided detailed opinions on the various bureaus under the Municipal Government as follows: (1) Police administration: It was proposed to abolish the Juvenile Police Team. The "Flying Fortress" (mobile patrol unit) should also be merged with the Motor Vehicle Brigade, and a portion of the personnel should be dismissed. The mobile police stations of the various sub-bureaus should also be abolished, and the name "Economic Police" should be eliminated. The original tasks should be returned to the general administrative police, and all personnel should be reassigned to strengthen the various sub-bureaus and the Security Police Brigade. The Police Education Hall should also be merged under the management of the Police School. (2) Educational administration: The National Education Classes exist in name only. The funds for these classes should be used to add classes to national schools and construct more national school buildings. The Mobile Education Team should be abolished, and its funds should be used to strengthen national education and secondary education. In addition, organizations such as the Pudong Rural Education Zone, the Huxi People's Livelihood Education Zone, the Electrified Education Team, and the People's Literacy Movement Committee should also be abolished. The saved funds should be reallocated for other urgent needs. (3) Public works administration: Several overlapping agencies, such as the Parks Management Office, should be abolished. (4) Public utilities administration: The Vehicle Registration Office should be reformed, and its functions should be merged into the Fourth Division to streamline operations and administration. (5) Health administration: There is no need to separately establish the Venereal Disease Prevention and Treatment Center and the Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Center. They should be abolished. All municipal hospitals should be converted to public hospitals and establish a board of directors. The Municipal Government should provide free rental of the hospital site and buildings, and each hospital should maintain its original free hospital beds. The funds listed in this year's budget should be converted to subsidies. (6) Social administration: The "Three Public Projects" (San Gong Dian) run by the Social Bureau are underfunded and have little practical effect, so they should also be discontinued. Regarding the elimination of redundant personnel, the report pointed out that the Secretariat of the Municipal Government has 120 technicians. It is recommended to eliminate the weak and retain the strong, and appropriately reduce the number. Due to economic difficulties and a lack of materials, the Public Works Bureau cannot proceed with the planned construction projects, so the road construction personnel should also be reorganized and reduced. After the simplification of business tax collection by the Finance Bureau, the personnel managing business tax in the Business Tax Section and the various collection offices can also be appropriately reduced to save public funds.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Issues a Statement</p>
<p>Furthermore, a spokesperson for the Municipal Council stated regarding the news published in last night's evening edition of the Shishi Xinbao (The China Times) regarding the council's review of the 38th annual Municipal Government budget, that the council's eighth general meeting reviewed the 38th annual Municipal Government budget and found that the tax revenue estimates listed in the revenue section of the original draft budget were not entirely reasonable. Therefore, after careful review by the Budget Committee, the estimated revenue figures for certain taxes were appropriately increased. The council neither automatically created new taxes nor increased tax rates to increase the burden on the people. The purpose of increasing the revenue budget was to make the budget as close to reality as possible and to urge government tax officials to conscientiously fulfill the mission of executing the budget. This is a task that the council should undertake. The newspaper's headline, "A Strange Case of Budget Review: The Municipal Council Representing the People of Shanghai Actually Passes an Increased Revenue Budget," is confusing.</p>
<h3>British Tramways Experience a Brief Work Stoppage: Workers Refuse to Drive Trams from the Depot Due to Low Wages, Demanding Four Points.</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The tramways and trolleybuses of all lines belonging to the British Tramways Company suddenly experienced a work stoppage yesterday morning. All field workers at the Huishan Road and Hede Road depots refused to drive trams from the depot. Upon hearing this news, the executive committee of the company's labor union immediately went to persuade them. The crowd was agitated, saying that they could not make a living with their low wages, and they put forward demands, which totaled four items: (1) In accordance with the current practice of the telephone company, each person should be given an additional meal allowance of 75 cents per day. (2) The annual bonus should be paid out on the 14th of this month, starting with 3,000 yuan per person. If this amount is insufficient based on the cost of living index for this month, the difference will be supplemented after the index is released. (3) The current salary payment schedule of the 10th, 20th, and 30th of each month should be changed to the 5th, 15th, and 25th of each month. (4) Trolleybus drivers should receive an additional license fee of 2 yuan per month as before. The union's executive committee agreed to negotiate with management, and the workers then resumed work. The first tram left the Hede Road depot at 10:20 AM, and the first tram left the Huishan Road depot at 11 AM. By noon, all lines had fully returned to normal.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the union's executive committee went to the Social Bureau to request mediation but no resolution was reached. They will continue to go there today.</p>
<h3>Five Public Utility Unions Discuss the Issue of Year-End Bonuses</h3>
<p>Also, the five major public utility unions of the city – electricity, telephone, gas, French water and electricity, and tap water – held a joint meeting yesterday morning to discuss the issue of year-end bonuses. They believe that the December index is too low to represent current prices and that the year-end bonus should be calculated based on the January index. The bonus should be paid out on the 14th of this month, starting with 30 times the base salary, with any adjustments to be made after the index is released.</p>

<h3>Authorities Decide on Methods to Sell Goods and Suppress Price Inflation</h3>
<p>The authorities have decided to organize a committee to sell goods and suppress price inflation with all their might. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, Shan Shuzeng of the Central Bank, Xu Zongwei of the US Aid Agency, and Whitt of the Economic Cooperation Administration held a meeting and drafted the following five measures for selling goods:</p>
<p>(1) A three-person committee organized by the Economic Cooperation Administration's US Aid Joint Operations Association and the Central Bank will be responsible for handling the sale. The representative of the Economic Cooperation Administration will be the chairman.</p>
<p>(2) The funds obtained from the sale, which will be entrusted to the China Textile Construction Corporation (CTCC) to carry out the sale procedures, will be paid directly by the customer into the locked account within the Central Bank and the US Aid Joint Operations Team.</p>
<p>(3) The CTCC will report the market price to the committee every day between 11 AM and 12 PM. The committee will then decide on the number of items to be sold, the quality, and the brands to be sold on the market. The method of selling will be various counts of cotton yarn and unfixed amounts of brands during trading hours. Purchasers will fill out purchase orders and submit them to the collection office. After the purchase orders are collected, the CTCC will open the boxes under the supervision of the committee representative and the market supervisor. If the number of requests does not exceed the quantity available, allocation will be made accordingly. If it is exceeded, the committee will decide on a reduction. The remaining procedures will be handled in accordance with the CTCC's agency regulations.</p>
<p>(4) The target of the sale will be yarn merchants and reproduction industries registered with the CTCC.</p>
<p>(5) These measures should be notified to the Yarn Trade Association immediately, and a representative should be appointed to supervise the opening of the boxes and add a seal to the purchase orders to certify them.</p>
<h3>CTCC Continues Large-Scale Sales, Yarn and Cloth Market Remains Buoyant</h3>

The US Aid Yarn and Cloth Joint Operations Office entrusted the CTCC to list and sell one type of 42-count Red Blue Phoenix yarn, the Central Bank entrusted the CTCC to list and sell one type of 21-count Golden Double Horse yarn, and the CTCC itself listed and sold thirteen types of cotton yarns, such as 6-count Secondary Sunlight yarn, in large quantities to absorb idle funds.</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market was strong again yesterday. Stimulated by the rise in financial commodities, market sentiment turned positive, and buying interest increased, leading to a firm and rising market price. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose from 84,000 yuan to 90,000 yuan at the close, an increase of 11,500 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix yarn reached 90,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon yarn opened at 70,000 yuan, reached a high of 74,000 yuan during the day, and closed at 73,000 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 10,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at a low of 51,000 yuan, then rose to 60,000 yuan with buyers still entering the market. Before closing, it broke the 60,000 yuan mark, reaching a new high of 60,500 yuan, but finally fell slightly back to 58,500 yuan, an increase of 9,500 yuan. Factory orders for the next day were at 57,500 yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn rose from 46,000 yuan to 52,000 yuan at the close, an increase of 8,000 yuan from the previous day. 16-count Brightness and Sanming yarns were both traded outside the 40,000 yuan mark. All other yarns also showed a rising trend.</p>
<p>The cloth market rebounded and rose sharply, opening briskly in the morning. After the sharp drop in good-quality products in recent days, many buyers took advantage of the low prices to enter the market. Taiwanese and Guangdong merchants also made scattered purchases. Dyeing factories on this street were actively searching for grey cloth, especially fine cloths such as Leading Brand, Wufu Loudspeaker, and Child Brand, which were in short supply due to depleted stocks. Other grades generally rebounded by about 20%. Leading Brand fine cloth was initially offered at 2,000 yuan outside the market, but rose to 2,200 yuan at noon. Mid-range fine cloths were mainly traded for brands such as Kai B Leading Brand and Qingdao Xihe. Market prices also rose by 300 to 400 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge rose from 1,920 yuan to a high of 1,940 yuan, but fell to a low of 1,840 yuan near noon. At the close, it recovered to 1,830 yuan, an increase of 230 yuan. It was said that there were still inquiries at 1,920 yuan after the close. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong rose by 210 yuan from the previous day, closing at 1,950 yuan. The most significant increase in factory shipments was for printed serge, which rose by 500 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Silk Recovers</h3>
<p>Superior-grade raw silk opened at 88,000 yuan. Afterwards, because the market price rose and buying interest increased, the price rose. The afternoon close rose to 92,000 yuan, an increase of 6,700 yuan from yesterday. Zhili Gan silk rose to 70,000 yuan. There were few other inquiries. Because of the foreign exchange discount, the distance between the foreign export trading houses and the market price was too great, so they were all waiting and watching, and the future remained bleak.</p>
<p>Artificial silk Tianqiao opened at 82,000 yuan, then immediately rose to 88,000 yuan for spot goods available immediately. Forward transactions were at 94,000 yuan, an increase of more than 10,000 yuan from yesterday's afternoon close. Intra-industry arbitrage was 90 cents to 1 yuan daily interest.

<h3>Joint Operations Office Requests Increase in the Proportion of Textile Exports</h3>
<p>In order to increase the export of textiles, the Foreign Trade Joint Operations Office decided to request the Executive Yuan to increase the export ratio from 20% to 30% of each factory's production rate. It is possible that the Executive Yuan will approve this. Currently, the largest proportion of exported textiles is to Indonesia.</p>
<h3>Export Exchange Settlement Decreases Slightly</h3>
<p>Totaling More Than 2.4 Million US Dollars Last Week</p>
<p>[Our Report] According to news from the Export Management Committee, the amount of foreign exchange settled for export goods in Shanghai this week (3rd to 8th) decreased slightly compared to last week.

There were a total of nineteen kinds of goods, among which tea accounted for the largest share, totaling 485,561.12 US dollars. The second was other vegetable oils, totaling 360,390.50 US dollars. The third was cloth, totaling 257,110.33 US dollars. The fourth was bristles, totaling 229,086.13 US dollars. Tung oil ranked fifth, totaling 193,200.00 US dollars.</p>

<h3>Overseas Remittance Quotes Rise Again, Foreign Exchange Certificate Prices Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's overseas remittance quotes rose again by 20 yuan, reaching 190 yuan. Because the Central Bank sold a considerable amount of foreign exchange transfer certificates, the price remained stable, closing at 188 yuan for buying and 189 yuan for selling.</p>
<h3>Import Licensing Standards Relaxed</h3>
<p>Averages 2.5 Million US Dollars per Week</p>
<p>According to the Export Management Committee, since the implementation of the import-export linkage system, the export business has significantly improved because the foreign exchange settlement prices are adjusted according to the facts at any time. In order to thoroughly promote the import-export linkage system, the Export Management Committee has recently relaxed the review standards for import licensing again. Currently, the import licenses issued daily are approximately between 200,000 and 400,000 US dollars, averaging about 2.5 million US dollars per week. Most of these issued licenses belong to the quota part which was issued earlier, but the number belonging to the non-quota part is also substantial. If the export situation can continue to improve, the relaxation of the quotas for the second quarter of the 90th year is expected to be approved by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Changes in Interest Rate Quotes of National Banks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the interest rate quotes of national banks were changed. The rediscount and daily discount were changed to 23 yuan and 30 cents, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 70 cents. The interbank lending daily discount was changed to 19 yuan and 20 cents, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 57.6 cents.</p>
<h3>National Banks Actively Prepare to Improve the Measures for Offsetting Special Foreign Currency Certificates</h3>

It is understood that the meeting decided to maintain the principles approved by the Executive Yuan regarding the offsetting measures. Regarding the issuance technology, efforts will be made to simplify it. The China Trust Bureau and the Central Bank are actively preparing. The China Trust Bureau is rushing to issue notifications to the Central Bank, and the Central Bank will immediately produce and print foreign currency certificates. The portion of foreign exchange to be offset is expected to be issued next week.</p>
<h3>Money Market Slightly Loosens, Rice, Flour, and Edible Oil Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market rebounded again, because the money market was slightly looser, off-site prices rebounded, and market sentiment also turned positive. In addition, the arrival of goods decreased, and opening bids rose by about 200 yuan. However, because the shadow interest rate was still high, the appetite of the grain merchants was not strong, so although the price rose, sales were not active, and the price fell back by 50 yuan. The South City market price for white japonica rice was 1,445 yuan, the price for thin japonica rice was initially 1,500 yuan, closing at 1,450 yuan, and the price for early rice was 1,400 yuan, each rising by about 150 yuan compared to the previous day. White yuan rice rose by 150 yuan, and Yin yuan rice rose by 200 yuan. In the North City market, early thin japonica rice and white japonica rice each rose by 150 to 160 yuan. The total arrival of goods in the two markets was 6,143 shi.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Turned up, Lao Che and Bingchuan flour were offered outside the 500-yuan mark again. Due to the rise in rice prices and off-site prices, and the slightly loosened money market, the market turned firm. Lao Che flour opened immediately at 500 yuan, reaching 505 yuan, and later rose further to 515 yuan at the close, an increase of 62 yuan. Bingchuan flour closed at 504 yuan, an increase of 66 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng flour each rose by 65 yuan, and miscellaneous brand flour rose by 60 to 70 yuan. Large bags of bran rose sharply by 58 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Xiangrong and soybeans rose by 100 yuan. Hankou Zhazou beans have not opened for many days, and opened at 900 yuan yesterday. Jianqing rose by 150 yuan, but returned to fatigue at the close. Corn fell uniquely, because the Qingdao price was fatigued and the out-of-town merchants did not accept it. The closing price fell by 50 yuan. Red sorghum still had good sales in the interior, rising by 50 yuan. Green bean flour factories reduced sales, rising by 100 yuan. Yuan wheat rose by 70 to 80 yuan, and sesame rose by 200 to 250 yuan. Raw peanut owners also raised the price by 200 to 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Rose. Due to the rise in black market gold prices and the slightly loosened money market, the owners raised the price. Soybean oil initially opened at 4,600 yuan, reached a high of 4,900 yuan, and closed at 4,800 yuan, an increase of 600 yuan from the previous day. Rapeseed oil rose from 4,400 yuan to 4,600 yuan, closing at 4,600 yuan, an increase of 550 yuan. Jibao rapeseed oil crossed the 5,000 yuan mark, reaching 5,300 yuan, an increase of 500 yuan. Small-scale sesame oil had the lowest price, closing at only 3,900 yuan, an increase of 400 yuan. Soybean cake sales were sluggish, mostly transactions by retail investors, and the price rose by 30 to 40 yuan. Changzi cake closed at 360 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market's Rising Trend Difficult to Curb</h3>
<p>Since the tea market has been rising steadily for days, yesterday it was still brisk and not discouraged. Although the market's position was not relaxed, the minds of the same industry were still nurtured by the surge in prices outside the circle. In addition, tea stocks were depleted and the cost of reproduction was still difficult to suppress, so sales intentions were still firm, and quotations soared again. As a result, the trend was reported to be repeatedly increased. Judging from this situation, the rising trend of selling prices may be difficult to reverse temporarily. As for checking transactions, because the entry was quite difficult to achieve, the business was still narrow.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The French ship Mandu left Shanghai yesterday morning to return to France, with a large batch of tea transported, totaling more than 14,500 boxes, equivalent to 2,400 tons, transported to Casablanca, North Africa. There were also 24 packages of silk waste transported to Marseille.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Trend Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Tung Oil Market: After opening, it turned brisk and extraordinary due to the relaxation of the money market, the reported rise in various items, and the induced entry of people's minds into the rising trend. After that, the position was tight again, and the same industry was greatly threatened. The process gradually returned to flat, and the closing result was mostly similar to the next day, but the base was more solid than before.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match Postponed to April; This Weekend's Shanghai Selection Trials Cancelled; Hannibal Applies for Early Reinstatement</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The annual Shanghai-Hong Kong interport football match, scheduled to be held in Shanghai this year with the Hong Kong team visiting, has been postponed. At the beginning of the season, the Shanghai Municipal Sports Association Football Committee sent a letter of invitation, which the Hong Kong side accepted and indicated their intention to fulfill. Last month, the Football Committee, believing the situation to be stable, telegraphed Hong Kong again to confirm their visit and simultaneously began preparations. Hong Kong delayed their response for a long time, until yesterday, when their reply finally arrived, requesting a postponement until April. The Football Committee held a special meeting yesterday afternoon, passing the Hong Kong side's request to extend the match to April and temporarily halting all preparatory work. The trials scheduled for this weekend have also been cancelled. Regarding Hannibal's application for reinstatement, expressing remorse for his actions, the Football Committee decided yesterday not to immediately approve it, only agreeing to restore his eligibility to play after August 31st. This is undoubtedly a considerable disappointment for the Tung Wah Football Club.</p>

<p>(3) The second round of the Group A matches will begin on January 22nd. Teams may apply to schedule friendly matches this weekend.</p>

Due to the clear weather, nearly a thousand spectators went to Nanshi to watch the match. Samsung kicked off and attacked first, losing two opportunities within ten minutes.

<h3>New Basketball Rules for This Year; Basketball Committee Announces Key Points</h3>

These new rules arrived by airmail a few days ago. Since this year's league is about to begin, the Municipal Basketball Committee will translate and publish the new rules. The key points of the new rules for this year (1948-49) that differ from the old rules are announced below for your attention.</p>
<p>(1) A player who commits a personal foul should raise their hand above their head when the referee announces the foul to help the scorer record the personal foul correctly. However, this is a suggestion and there is no penalty for not doing so.</p>
<p>(Old rules: No need to raise hand)</p>
<p>(2) A substitute player reports to the scorer and waits for the whistle. After the referee or inspector indicates with a hand signal, the substitute can directly enter the court without reporting to the referee or inspector.</p>
<p>(Old rules: Failure to report to the referee or inspector is a technical foul)</p>
<p>(3) In a 40-minute game, the clock should be stopped for every dead ball after 18 minutes in the second half (the last two minutes) and in the last two minutes of each overtime period.</p>
<p>(Old rules: Last three minutes)</p>
<p>(4) All jump balls must be held in the nearest restricted circle (i.e., the center circle with a radius of six and a half feet and the two large circles in the free-throw areas).</p>
<p>(Old rules: If players touching the restricted circle during a jump ball, the jump ball is held in the restricted circle. If a jump ball is near the sideline, it is held six feet away from the sideline. Jump balls in other locations are held nearby)</p>
<p>(5) After a jump ball is tapped, any one of the ten players can touch the ball first and pass it back to the backcourt.</p>
<p>(Old rules: Only the eight players other than the jumpers have this right)</p>
<p>(6) When the ball goes out of bounds, if it is simultaneously touched last by players from both teams or the officials have conflicting opinions, a jump ball should be held between the two relevant opponents in the nearest restricted circle.</p>
<p>(Old rules: Jump ball is held six feet from the sideline)</p>
<p>(7) If a designated free-throw shooter leaves the court due to injury or disqualifying foul, the free throw should be taken by their substitute. If the team has no substitute players, it can be taken by any of the remaining teammates on the court.</p>
<p>(Old rules: Did not specify that a teammate on the court could take the free throw)</p>
<p>(8) If a player is substituted out of the game during a dead ball, and the game has not yet restarted during the same dead ball time, the player can immediately be substituted back in without it being considered a technical foul.</p>
<p>(Old rules: This is a technical foul)</p>
<p>(9) Players may talk or discuss with the coach during a timeout.</p>
<p>(Old rules: This is considered coaching from outside the court and is a technical foul)</p>
<p>(10) When throwing the ball inbounds, if teammates on the court are standing close to the sideline in a row, the opposing team can request that the players of the two teams stand apart.</p>
<p>(Old rules: No such provision)</p>

<h3>Appealing Before Justice: A Distressed Woman Pleads for Assistance from Kind-Hearted Individuals; Willing to Do Any Work; Financial Assistance More Than Welcome</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: The cruelty and ruthlessness of the times have transformed my personality, which for over twenty years had never shed a tear or lowered its head easily, into a helpless and powerless weak woman. I remember when I was in school, listening to history stories, I was deeply impressed by the extraordinary deeds of so-called Hua Mulan, Qin Liangyu, Shen Yunying, and other remarkable women. A vivid and dazzling dream often lingered in my mind, waiting for the arrival of a great opportunity. Coincidentally, when I was fifteen years old, the sacred national war of resistance broke out, and my beautiful dream came true. I took off my skirt, disguised myself as a man, and on the eve of the great storm about to descend on my hometown of Zhengzhou, I abandoned my warm family, my kind parents, and set out on a journey with a group of young companions. I participated in almost every battle, including the Battle of He'erzhuang, the Battle of Xuzhou, and the Great Fire of Changsha, braving the dangers of the battlefield. I regret not being able to personally kill the enemy invaders, but I did my part as a Chinese daughter. My footsteps traversed Lu, Yu, Xiang, E, Gan, Gui, and Sichuan, and I ended up in the Great Northwest, still engaged in supporting the war of resistance, for as long as four years. Eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, riding horses and shooting guns, all enriched my small life. At this time, my life underwent another major transformation, which was that I pursued another life, and married, and had children. In my seven years of kitchen life, there was my happiness, and there were also many of my troubles, but I believed that I could also fulfill my so-called "domestic help" responsibilities. However, because our burden was extremely heavy, for seven or eight years we have been struggling below the level of barely making ends meet. Unfortunately, the bitter years are endless, and the tragic wheel of fate is pursuing the country, and also pursuing us. This summer, my hometown was occupied, and dragging my children with me, I fled to the south of the Yangtze River, with no one to turn to, and because I had no savings, I began to suffer the hardships of the world. In those three months of unemployment, there were times when we ate only one meal a day, and there were times when we could not light a fire for three days. The sound of my children crying from hunger shattered my heart. At this time, I, a woman who rarely shed tears, often washed my face with tears in the quiet of the night, unable to control myself. Fortunately, heaven never cuts off all hope, and we finally found a glimmer of life in this vast sea, which allowed us to stabilize our refugee life for a few months. Who would have thought that after the battle in Huaihai, and the capital being shaken, our only rice bowl was blown away by the ruthless storm! (To be continued)</p>

In these days, the people of Sichuan Province are maintaining a stable mood, expecting new developments in the situation. The Sichuan Provincial Assembly, in the midst of chilling winds and rain, reviewed and successfully concluded the "Sichuan People's Self-Defense Measures." These measures indicate that the people of Sichuan Province are taking the correct path, maintaining stability while waiting for change, and welcoming a glorious peace through self-defense preparations.</p>

<h3>Changzhou County Government Stalled, New County Chief Has Not Assumed Office</h3>
<p>[Report from Wujin, this newspaper, 11th] Since the former county chief of this county, Luo Dongfan, resigned to go to Beijing to serve as the Director of the Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs, the new county chief, Wu Zhilin, has been approved and announced by the provincial government meeting for more than ten days. The county government has not received any news about when Wu will arrive. The former section secretary of the county government returned to await handover and repeatedly telegraphed the provincial government to urge him to come, but there was no response. According to news from the provincial capital: the Department of Civil Affairs has not seen the new county chief report to the personnel office, and does not know his contact address. A special dispatch order was sent to Chairman Ding's official residence for transfer, but it was returned. The Personnel Office of the Department of Civil Affairs and the Provincial Adjutant's Office are sending personnel to search everywhere. Currently, the heads of the Land Administration Bureau and the Land Tax Office of the county government have resigned with permission, and all departments are waiting to be handed over, resulting in the stagnation of county administration.</p>
<p>The Congested Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway 本報記者 Jiang Feng [Report from Jinhua, this newspaper, 8th] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which runs through the three provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan, was finally completed before the start of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign with the repair of the Gan River pontoon bridge, and the entire line was opened. This lifeline of the southeast is once again shouldering the dual responsibility of military affairs and transportation.</p>
<p>In the past month or so, the traffic density on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line has suddenly increased several times. Under the condition of congenital deficiency, it appears to be somewhat congested. Initially, thousands upon thousands of refugee students poured from all corners of the Central Plains to the Shanghai-Nanjing area, and then followed the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line to be sent to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces to establish schools and settle down. For a period of time, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was used to transport refugees from the four provinces of Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui. Passenger and freight trains Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 41, and 42 were suspended, and all rolling stock was allocated to transport refugee students. Sometimes, even express trains Nos. 1 and 2 were attached with special trains to evacuate students. It took a full month to bring the evacuation of more than 20,000 refugee students to an end.</p>
<p>Following this, the Xuzhou-Bengbu war became urgent, and large and small agencies in Nanjing were busy evacuating their families. In addition to some who went south via the sea and air routes, most of the families and luggage poured into the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line. They transferred to Zhuzhou, and then transferred to Hengyang, Guilin, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. Every day, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line was full of special evacuation trains heading southwest, and ordinary passenger and freight trains almost disappeared.</p>
<p>At the same time, the four railway lines of Longhai, Jinpu, Huainan, and Jiangnan were also affected by the war and were busy evacuating employees, families, materials, and files to the southwest. As a result, the evacuation special trains of each railway also passed through the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway one after another, turning to various places in the southwest.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi line was repaired not long ago, and its own rolling stock was extremely lacking. Most of the carriages were allocated to evacuate government officials, families, refugee students, and military transport. Therefore, the passenger and freight transport of this line was almost paralyzed. The original daily passenger and freight transport was crowded on the few passenger and freight trains that were available and occasionally operated. Often, they would have to wait for three or four days at the starting station without being able to get on the train.</p>
<p>Because the train service was in a state of semi-paralysis, the prices of goods in the cities along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line became unbalanced, creating opportunities for individual peddlers to become active. All trains were crowded with "individual peddlers." From western-style and Guangzhou general merchandise such as cigarettes, cloth, matches, soap, and cotton fabrics heading west, to local products such as chicken, duck, pork, winter bamboo shoots, and oranges heading north, a wide variety of items were scattered on the backs, roofs, or crowded in the carriages. This further increased the congestion and chaos of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line.</p>
<p>In this way, the recently restored Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway suddenly increased in traffic density due to the impact of the war. However, all facilities are still extremely simple. For example, some small stations have insufficient tracks. If a train breaks down due to some special situation, the trains going up and down the line cannot pass. Another example is Jinhua Station, which has seven tracks, which is usually sufficient for the traffic density of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway itself. However, because the evacuation trains passing through the station are often parked and fill every track, the trains going up and down the line are detained at the front stations at both ends for several hours, waiting for the tracks to be cleared before they can enter the station.</p>
<p>Another reason that deepens the congestion of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line is that the driving force of the entire line relies entirely on Pingxiang coal in the far west to supply the trains in the east, which has to be driven by Pingxiang coal more than a thousand kilometers away. Therefore, it is often too slow to meet the urgent need. For example, at Jinhua Station, there were five westbound trains parked at the station at the same time one day, waiting for the coal from the east to arrive. According to the person in charge of train operations on the line, the reporter was told that the coal transport trains of the line are sometimes intercepted and detained by soldiers who do not understand the situation, forcing them to carry other items or military transport. Therefore, the coal supply at each coal loading station on the entire line has been seriously affected, which has deepened the paralysis of the entire line.</p>
<p>The reporter recently made a round trip on the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, and saw that the congestion in the carriages and the chaos in the order were really like the scene of fleeing from disaster in 1937. Day and night, tens of thousands of passengers and mountains of luggage are waiting for trains. As long as there is a train, they will squeeze onto it. The young and strong, or those who hold guns, take advantage. In addition to being crowded with people, the carriages are also full of boxes, luggage, stoves, cooking utensils, tables, chairs, sofas, and even cradles and toilets... All kinds of things are messy and crowded. The carriage doors and aisles are completely blocked. If you can get on the train, you may not be able to get off the train. The windows are broken repeatedly, almost forming a convenient door for those getting on and off the train.</p>
<p>It is said that the authorities of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have exhausted their efforts to think of ways to improve the situation and restore normal train operation. It is hoped that this chaotic and congested situation can be completely eliminated in the short term.</p>
<h3>Battle at Tsinghua Garden Lasted a Day and Night; Fortunate That Shells Landed in the School</h3>
<p>[Tianjin, 10th, airmail] During the recent battle, fighting occurred near the campus for a day and night. However, no shells landed in the school, and it was not subjected to looting due to strict defense. It is now a demilitarized zone. On the 20th of last month, a plane once flew over to drop a total of nine bombs. One landed next to a small bridge in front of the 工字 Hall, one landed on the northern road of the West Courtyard, and the remaining seven landed in open spaces. Fortunately, no one was injured, and no school buildings were hit. All employees and students in the school are safe, and there have been no more planes bombing since then. Winter vacation started on the 9th. The stored grain is enough for three months, and there is no problem with living. Postal and telecommunications between the city and the countryside have been interrupted for a long time, and remittances are also impossible. There are also a large number of people isolated in the city, including more than 100 families of teachers and staff, and more than 200 students. The Teachers and Staff Liaison Committee is responsible for solving various problems.</p>
<h3>Passenger Car on Jia-Tong Road Overturned in the Calamity of War: Two Dead, Twenty-Four Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from Jiaxing, this newspaper, 11th] A car on the Jiaxing-Tongxiang Road overturned in the middle of the road on the afternoon of the 10th. Two passengers died on the spot, twenty-four were injured, and six escaped unharmed. It is learned that the overturned passenger car was No. 1300, originally driven by driver Li Youhai. Due to a temporary illness, it was driven by driver Li Sibao. When the car was driving to Yangqiao No. 7 (about seven kilometers away from Hecheng), the bridge was completely filled with mud. The mud surface was loose due to sunlight during the cold weather in the past few days. When the car reached the bridge surface, the front wheels fell in, and the car body tilted. For a while, the driver could not control it, causing the car body to overturn into a paddy field eight feet high from the bridge surface, causing this tragedy.</p>
<h3>The Bubble of Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Xie Mingxin</p>
<p>[Hong Kong, 11th, airmail] A cold wave has struck, and the weather in Shanghai has dropped below zero degrees Celsius. Hong Kong is still around 40 to 50 degrees Celsius, but people living in Hong Kong have already felt surprisingly cold.</p>
<p>In the past, Hong Kong was still a political center. Shen Junru, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Bojun and other "democratic figures" went north earlier. Recently, Li Jishen, Mao Dun, Shi Fuliang and others left Hong Kong around Christmas last year. The only people left are Long Yun, who is on "leave," and some second- and third-rate figures from the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, today's Hong Kong is no longer a Chinese political center on the periphery.</p>
<p>Due to the shift of the political center, Hong Kong residents unanimously took a dim view of the possibility of "peace talks" without expecting to. There are also one or two small parties (such as the Chinese Independent Democratic Party, etc.) composed of some idle political swindlers in Hong Kong, who are flaunting themselves everywhere, issuing declarations, printing pamphlets, and receiving reporters, preparing to make a futile investment in the "New Political Consultative Conference." Now this kind of speculative business has obviously failed. This is a small bubble in the political tide.</p>
<p>Taiwan Province has changed hands. Ms. Zheng Yuxiu, wife of the former governor of the province, Wei Daoming, arrived in Hong Kong on the 9th on the Shengjing, carrying more than a hundred pieces of luggage.</p>
<p>Although more and more people are coming to Hong Kong from the mainland every day, the phenomenon of business depression is spreading throughout the island. Although the streets are crowded with people, the business of the shops is unusually bleak. Merchants engaged in import and export are always sighing bitterly. Prices are depreciating day by day, and it is not uncommon for the selling price to be insufficient to cover the cost of ordering. The reason is that the war in the mainland is endless, and the market is becoming increasingly narrow. There are many orders and slow sales. Everyone is afraid of the approaching Lunar New Year. Special correspondent of this newspaper</p>
<h3>Feicheng Past and Present</h3>
<p>— Special correspondent of Sanbao News 費超然 Fei Chaoran</p>
<p>[Report from Hefei, this newspaper, 7th] After the victory, the provincial government came here gracefully. Hefei was like a dead tree in spring, with a hundred flowers blooming. The ancient city, which had been broken after the robbery, leapt to become the central metropolis of Anhui Province's politics and military affairs, and the population suddenly increased dramatically. In the past three years, the market has become increasingly prosperous and all industries have become increasingly developed. However, all prices have continued to rise due to excessive consumption. The luckiest merchants all smiled and made a fortune year after year. Teahouses, restaurants, hotels, and bathhouses were full every day. The housing shortage also became increasingly serious every day. Every landlord regarded their house as a scarce commodity. Every morning, the area west of Shizi Street, the Fuxue, and the two vegetable markets were crowded with elegantly dressed, imposing modern ladies who were purchasing rice, grass, oil, salt, fish, meat, vegetables, and household items. They pretended to be rich and did not care about the high prices. In the spring of 1948, the construction of the new Hefei began again, and most of it has now been completed, which is enough for the conditions of a small city. In the midst of this heated activity, unexpectedly, the provincial government and various departments suddenly moved back to Anqing on December 20, 1948, amidst the sound of "talent going to the countryside." Government officials and their families, who were dispersed to the corners of 64 counties and cities, flowed out in various ways like a tide. The Hefei market suddenly felt the desolation of few visitors. The reporter specifically reports on the current situation as follows:</p>
<p>After the Provincial Government Moved, All Industries Declined</p>
<p>According to a detailed investigation of the Hefei market: there are only a dozen or so sole proprietorships, and the rest are shareholders' businesses that pool together small amounts of money. There are fewer wholesale businesses and more retail businesses. The only main customers are government employees and their families who are consumers. As a result, government employees became thinner day by day, while business and industrial elements became fatter day by day. Since the end of last year, the general clientele has left, and the retail business has plummeted. In addition, every family has renovated their facades, cutting flesh to cure carbuncles, spending huge construction costs. The turbulent situation has also affected the flourishing business of the "golden September and silver October." At the same time, Hefei's banks and money houses have also been evacuated and closed, making it impossible to turn around. Large-scale transportation and sales have high expenditures and limited income. Therefore, until now, except for a few merchants with strong capital, who have a slight surplus, all the others are at risk of losing money after calculating the accounts. It is feared that many of the businesses selling imported goods will close down next spring. Recently, dozens of military uniform stores, photo studios, printing shops, and barber shops have closed down and moved away. The market has found a bleak scene, which makes people feel the sense of the past and present. Even the foreign modern ladies who frequented the area west of Shizi Street, the Fuxue, and the two vegetable markets have disappeared without a trace. The prices of rice, grass, oil, salt, fish, meat, vegetables, and daily necessities cannot rise crazily, turning into a blessing for ordinary people.</p>
<p>A Half-Finished Beauty of New Architecture</p>
<p>The old and broken Feicheng after the robbery was transformed into a new city in the spring of 1948, thanks to the resolute decision of the former Director of Construction, Zhang Zongliang, who ordered the Municipal Engineering Bureau to divide the entire city into four phases and start construction in sections. The first phase was the section of Zhongzheng East Road (from Dongdajie to Shizijiekou), about three miles of business houses, each retreated one room to the north and south, and repaired into cement pedestrian streets. The facade was rebuilt in western style, and the original red foundation stone road in the street was rebuilt into a flat and wide road. After several months of construction, the project was completed after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The second phase was the section of Zhongzheng Middle Road (from Guloudajie to Fuxuejie) and Yingdian Middle Road (from Shizijie to Sipailou North Street). After the Mid-Autumn Festival, about four miles of intensive reconstruction projects were carried out as described above. About nine-tenths of the project has now been completed, and the road is still being paved. It is expected that it will be fully completed outside the Lunar New Year. At present, the city appearance of the east and middle sections of Hefei has been completely renewed, with the atmosphere of a small city. However, the third phase of the project, Zhongshan East, Middle, and West Roads (from Xiaodongmen to Dazhimen), and the fourth phase of Yingdian North Road (from Shizijie North to Beimenkou) are likely to be slowed down or stopped after the provincial capital moved, due to the large scale of the project and the difficulty in construction costs. Feicheng will become a city with a combination of new and old, as if it is a half-finished beauty.</p>
<p>People Gone, Buildings Empty; Arrogant Before, Respectful After</p>
<p>Landlords who regarded their houses as scarce commodities used to increase rents every one or two months, even abandoning the use of legal tender and gold yuan coupons, and changing the rent to three to five dou of rice per room. They even demanded prepayment of three months, five months, one year, or half a year. The conditions were harsh, forcing the government employees who were tenants to have no way to go, so they had to endure, borrow and pawn to pay the rent rice, so as not to be homeless. They formed a tenants' union several times to negotiate together, but it was ineffective. Now that people are gone, houses are empty everywhere, and the situation is very different. The landlords are particularly polite, changing their former hideous faces. In order to avoid stationing troops, they are asking people everywhere to introduce tenants, welcoming them to move in immediately. The rent is also generous, automatically reducing it by half, or not caring about it; some even do not want rent, and allow people to live for free, just so that others do not occupy it. The arrogance before and the respect after is to this extent!</p>

<h3>Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hunan Provinces Cooperate to Prohibit Opium: Measures for Neighboring Areas Have Been Drafted</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanchang, this newspaper, 8th, airmail] Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hunan provinces, in order to strengthen the suppression of opium in neighboring areas, have specially drafted a "Measures for the Joint Suppression of Opium in Neighboring Areas by the Seven Provinces." The Henan Provincial authorities issued an order on the 6th to the Administrative Commissioners' Offices of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 9th districts and 19 counties, including Yichun, to comply with the measures, which are as follows: (1) Regarding opium cases between a county belonging to Province A and a county belonging to Province B, the county belonging to Province B is authorized to suppress it, but the handling situation shall be reported to the county belonging to Province A for review. (2) In areas where the boundary line is unclear, before the demarcation is determined, the relevant county governments shall jointly be responsible for the suppression of opium, and shall handle it together at any time. If it is necessary to handle it urgently, they may conduct a separate search or arrest first, and report it to the neighboring province for review afterward. They shall not shirk responsibility or dispute with each other. (3) In areas where two or more provinces are adjacent and where the habit of stealing and planting opium seedlings has been formed, the county governments adjacent to the area shall jointly prevent and investigate and eradicate it, and any one county may automatically convene a meeting to discuss the handling. (4) If the opium control agencies in Province A discover that opium is being smuggled to a certain place in Province B, they shall immediately notify the opium control agency in that place in Province B by the fastest communication method to arrest it. If the time is tight and there is no time to notify, they may freely follow and pursue the opium and criminals. The opium and criminals shall be sent by the capturer to the county government under its jurisdiction for verification. (5) If Province A discovers that an opium criminal has fled to Province B, they shall immediately follow and pursue him regardless of the boundary, and notify the local government of the location to assist in the arrest. The local government of the location shall also take effective measures as soon as possible. The opium criminal shall be escorted to the county government under the jurisdiction of Province A for handling in accordance with the law. (6) If an opium criminal is hidden in a border area, and one party discovers it but the other party does not assist in the arrest, or if one party pursues an opium fugitive and the other party knows and assists in it, it shall be reported to the provincial government for punishment. (7) If opium criminals are hidden in a border area of two or more provinces, and they are not arrested and brought to justice but are discovered by others, the local officials in the border area shall be punished for ineffective suppression. (8) If there is a dispute or objection over the jurisdiction of opium and criminals arrested in cooperation in border areas, it shall be reported to the respective provincial governments for consultation and decision. (9) In border areas of two or more provinces, if a resident of Province A knows that a certain opium criminal or a certain Baojia chief in Province B is sheltering and hiding opium criminals, he shall be allowed to report it directly to the county government under the jurisdiction of Province B. (10) The county governments in the border areas of the seven provinces may, depending on the needs, negotiate with the relevant county governments under the jurisdiction of the neighboring provinces and report the detailed rules for cooperation based on these measures, and report them to the respective provincial governments for filing.
