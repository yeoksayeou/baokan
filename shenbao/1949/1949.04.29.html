<p>〔又電〕沿京滬路東進之共軍，進據蘇州後，潛伏於太湖之土共，乘機登陸騷擾，京杭國道綫上之長興·吳興兩縣地方政府及自衛團隊，均自動撤離，該兩縣之電訊亦先後中斷，吳興電話廿八日晨三時中斷，城內情況不明。</p>
<p>〔又電〕太湖土共千餘人，廿六日晚竄擾吳興，該縣地方政府及自衛團隊，廿八日晨三時由第一區行政督察專員施樹巒率領撤離縣城，退駐德清。又，莫干山地區土共相繼騷擾，廿八日下午五時武康縣城對外電訊一度中斷，杭州外圍國軍循京杭國道向武康吳興迎擊中。據軍方人士稱：國軍强大兵團已在京杭國道及杭嘉湖三角地區完成部署，待機殲敵，各地土共竄擾，小醜跳樑，不足為慮。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍方廿八日上午九時消息：（一）真義（卽正儀）鎮尚未發現匪情，崑山安定如常，惟商號多已打烊。（二）匪東南警衛團，通海獨立旅，南通警備團，共四千餘，於廿六日由白茆河口滸浦福山等地渡江後，卽集結於梅李附近地區，廿七日下午八時許，一部約一千餘人，與我軍在支塘隔河對峙中。</p>

<h3>美與英法商定　對華聯合政策　美駐華外交人員奉令留駐原地</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿七日電〕此間方面默認美國已與英·法兩國獲得對華之聯合政策，國務院權威人士廿七日稱，美國外交人員與中共今後在中共控制區中所有之關係，不應視為承認中共政府之初步。美國旣仍在北平，天津及南京繼續維持外交工作，則勢將與各地之中共當局發生關係，按照國際法，此種關係可能認為事實上承認此地方性之當局，官方對美政府正研究事實上承認中共政府之報道，則取極端緘默態度。彼等强調稱，唯有在中共正式成立政府後，始有考慮此事之可能。權威方面則指出美國在瀋陽，天津，北平之領事館，雖無任何工作，然皆未關閉。同時南京美大使住宅雖曾被共軍之侵入，但政府方面仍未考慮關閉大使館及領事館問題，故際此蔣介石氏宣佈將繼續作戰時，美國顯然擬在華實施「存在」政策。</p>

<h3>和談代表團未能南返　行政院宣布真相　負責人稱該團事實上已被扣留　五代表致何院長函發表</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿八日電〕自共黨破壞和談以來，各方對政府和談代表團何日南返，極為關切。記者為此就詢於行政院負責人士，得悉自本月廿一日毛澤東·朱德以頒發總攻擊令之方式破壞和談後，政府方面李代總統·何院長曾於廿二日致電北平和談代表團，告以卽派飛機往接，囑與共方接洽啓程日期，廿二日晚李代總統復與張治中氏通長途電話，告知次日派機前往，至專機自空中召回。廿四日政府又自滬派機飛平，何院長并託搭乘該機赴平之李明欣氏攜帶函件，分致張治中·邵力子諸氏，盼其立卽南返，該機於廿五日自平飛返時，攜回張治中等五代表親筆簽名之一函，告以共方對政府和談代表團應召南返一節，表示「堅決挽留·未肯同意」云云，似此情形，足證在平之政府和談代表事實上已被共黨扣留，故政院於廿七日院會時決定將和談代表團名義撤銷，今後共黨可能利用政府和談代表名義，作惡意宣傳，在各代表失卻自由之環境下，如有以彼等名義所發之言論，其必出諸假借，自無疑問，茲為說明此事真象，特將五代表親函發表於次：「敬之院長先生：李明欣先生帶來梗（廿三日）手示，敬悉，和談破裂以後，同人等正待命南返中，養（廿二日）晚間接奉德公電話，謂於翌日派機來平，當卽轉告各同仁，準備南行，并卽函告共方查照，旋由周恩來·林祖函·李立三諸人分別訪問同人等，堅相挽留，曾於養（廿二日），梗（廿三日）兩日兩電，并於梗（廿三日）晨向南京電話請示數處皆未得通，昨閱中央公司有機來平，復與共方洽商，申明必須南返理由，冀其同意，但周仍堅決挽留，未肯同意，如此祇有暫留靜待而已，尚盼亮察。再同人等此行未克達成任務，乃荷李代總統及先生函電相慰，殊深慚汗，并請為轉陳德公是禱，耑此奉覆，敬頌勛綏，張治中·邵力子·章士釗·李蒸·劉斐謹上，四月廿五日午前一時」。</p>

<h3>社論　革新政治　挽救危亡</h3>
<p>北平和談月餘不不幸終告破裂，陳兵江北的共軍，即強渡長江，戰事乃由長江北岸移到江南了。內戰的再起，不令使憧憬着和平的人民大為失望，而且使江南人民的心情益見沉重；再加以共軍總攻未及數日，國軍又因戰略關係，相繼放棄南京·鎮江·常州·無錫·蘇州等城，戰火步步東移，離開上海已不滿七十公里，軍事形勢的急轉直下，更使上海市民驚惶失措，大有惶惶然不可終日之勢。街頭巷尾，充滿了一片戰時景色，飛機場輪船碼頭塞滿了人頭，堆滿了行李，人人都想爭先恐後，高飛遠走，固不必說；就是上海四郊的居民，也是扶老携糼，掮筐提篋，紛紛移入市區，走向他們自以為安全的地方。不論他的理智如何清楚，不論他的意志如何堅強，面對當前優危震撼的動亂情況，終不免心驚肉跳，寢食不安，縱欲保持鎮靜而不可得，因此大家都以為大難當前，國家已到了最後關頭，但不知如何自救自處之道，以挽回國家的危亡。所以，在人民的心頭，充滿了焦急·懮慮·苦悶，和徬徨。</p>
<p>但在昨天看了蔣總裁發表的「告全國同胞書」之後，人們心頭的這種焦急·懮慮·苦悶和徬徨的心情，卻霍然消釋了。使全國人民都明瞭，目前的天際雖為陰霾所籠罩，蔣總裁也承認今日局勢的嚴重，甚至預言今後恐將益形惡化；但國家的前途是光明的，必有轉危為安的一天，和平的陽光必能衝散戰爭和陰霾大放光明，惟一個轉機能否來到，則要靠全國朝野的共同努力，尤其是要人民發揮力量挽救危亡。我們看了蔣總裁的文告，感喟萬千，真不知話從何說起；但站在人民的立場上說話，不得不希望政府切實遵守蔣總裁的指示，加倍努力，使這一艘破壞不堪的存盤能渡過驚濤駭浪，安然到過彼岸。</p>
<p>蔣總裁說：「今日只要我全國同胞一致奮起，擁護政府，督促政府，使政治有適時的改革，經濟有一定的方針，軍政幹部更能澈底覺悟，加強組織；只要我們接受失敗的教訓，使失敗成為陶冶和洗鍊，……深信我們國家轉危為安之機，即在今日」。這一段話雖對全國人民而說，實為針對政府而言。抗戰勝利四年以來，軍事節節失利，由東北而華北，由江北而江南，政府在每次軍事失敗之後，終是重申革新政治的決心，但每次的結果，終是使人民失望，開出來的支票終未能兌現，作風依舊。現在已到了最後關頭，軍事不容再度失敗，否則國家即陷於萬刦不復的境地；但是誰都知道，政治·軍事·與經濟，是三們一體的東西，絕不能加以分別，政府如仍不能痛下決心，澈底改革，使全國面目一新，則軍事仍難有轉弱為強的希望。失敗原不足懮，尤其是軍事上的勝負，在軍事家看來，更是常事，不必懮懼。誰都曉得，「失敗為成功之母」的格言；但是最可怕的，卻在「不知恥」和「不能接受失敗的教訓」。政府諸公對於總裁的指示，應特別警惕，多多反省。</p>
<p>總之，軍事的失敗不足懮，最可懮慮的，還是政治的不革新。舉一個歷史的例子吧，樂毅攻齊，連下七十餘城，祗留下莒和即墨兩城；可是田單　出，便恢復了齊國舊有的河山。以今視昔，亦猶昔之視今，我們不要悲觀，而要奮發有為，痛下決心，革新政治，終必能達到挽救危亡的任務。所以，今後國家能否轉危為安，亦將視今日　政府能否接受失敗的教訓澈底革新政治而定了。蔣總裁說：「過去的失敗，是我們政治的缺點，經濟的恐慌，和內部組織的鬆懈」所造成；這几句自我批評的警句，最值得在朝諸公深切反省的。時機迫切已到了最後關頭，全國朝野奮起區挽狂瀾，此其時矣。</p>
<h3>美蘇為解除柏林封鎖談判　已達最後決定階段　美要求蘇提出確實時間表　傑塞普與馬立克曾密談九十二分鍾</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕東西關於解除柏林封鎖之談判，今日已達最後決定階段，次一行動全在蘇聯。預料蘇聯即將答復美英法之問題，即蘇聯結束柏林封鎖之唯一條件，是否即為美英法同意舉行四外長會談。美英法已表示一旦柏林恢復正常，卽願出席會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿七日電〕美國已於今日請蘇聯提出正式聲明，說明蘇聯將於何時及在何種條件下，解除柏林封鎖。美駐聯合國代表傑塞普已於今晚向蘇外次兼駐聯合國代表馬立克提出此方面則謂其主要目的，在使柏林談判置入正式基礎，并以蘇聯意見登錄於在正式文件之上。照會內容，并就下列兩點，特別要求蘇聯說明，即解除柏林封鎖所將牽涉的範圍及解除封鎖的時間表。先是關係方面透露，美蘇代表鈄討論此一問題。美代表屆時將重申英美法三國對於解除封鎖及召開外長會議一事之立場。此間官方對此事均拘樂觀態度，認為柏林封鎖之解除及外長會之召開，可望在一至兩個月內實現。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿七日電〕美代表傑塞普與蘇聯外交次長葛羅米柯及馬立克今晨在上派克路蘇聯代表團辦事處三樓密談九十二分鍾。據悉，傑氏曾提出備忘錄，要求蘇聯切實說明解除柏林封鎖之條件。據美代表團發言人稱，傑氏所提出者，由外交意義言，并非一種照會，傑氏僅宣讀一種預擬文件，臨行并將此種文件留下，請蘇方亦以書面答復。傑氏係隻身乘車至蘇聯代表團辦事處，步入鐵門，即消息沓然，散會後亦獨自回至美國代表團辦事處。數分鍾後，葛羅米柯往成功湖出席聯合國大會委員會，對密談內容，守口如瓶。記者投刺問馬立克有無消息發表，答曰否，下次談判何時舉行亦在不可知之數。美方謂截至現在為止，談話僅屬非正式性質，下次談判日期可以電話臨時約定。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐約廿七日電〕美大全傑塞普與馬立克會晤以後，卽在紐約與英法官會商，然後遄返華府。先是傑塞普當日曾與美駐聯合國首席代表奥斯汀及代表團其他團員有所會商。馬立克與傑塞普談判之結局如何難尚未可知，但聯合國官員對於兩人在此間利用聯合國之便利一事，表示歡迎。聯合國秘書長賴依稱：「全世界均將歡迎此種努力打開柏林僵局之順利結局，與另一次外長會議之召開。余以為大多數人民對於兩大國家利用聯合國之途徑一事，亦將感覺欣慰，該兩國在一九四五年順利完成協定之努力，曾促成聯合國之成立」。</p>
<h3>美英法蘇四國代表　週內可能舉行會議　決定解除柏林封鎖及外長會日期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿八日廣播：成功湖訊：西方外交界人士預料美·英·法·蘇四國代表將於週內舉行會談，決定解除柏林封鎖及召開四強外長會談之日期。彼等預料外長會議可能於五月最後一星期在巴黎召開。</p>
<p>彼等證實蘇代表馬立克確曾向美代表傑塞普口頭保證：如果西方國家答應同時解除反封鎖，則蘇聯決可解除柏林封鎖，并同意定期召開四強外長會議。馬立克要求假以時日，以便得到維辛斯基之正式認可。馬立克到達弗勒興參加聯大全體會議，對柏林問題談判進展到若何程度之間話，避不作答，但詢以渠是否抱樂觀時，馬氏答稱：「我們蘇聯人一向是樂觀的」。</p>
<h3>美助理國務卿　晤葛羅米柯</h3>
<p>為柏林問題作非正式洽談</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕美助理國務卿魯思克今日自華盛頓飛紐約，往晤蘇聯首席外次出席聯大首席代表葛羅米柯，就柏林封鎖問題舉行非正式接洽。按美駐聯合國代表傑塞普與蘇駐聯合國代表馬立克已曾就此事交換意見，故魯思克與葛羅米柯之會晤乃兩國以更高級之水準進行接洽此事。</p>
<h3>美英法與蘇談判期間　莫斯科情緒極佳　四強關係將晋入新階段</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿七日電〕此間一般情緒今日感覺蘇聯與美英法三國關係即可改善臻一戰後新階段。雖無一人能預測，除解除柏林封鎖外，尚成成立何種解放辦法。惟消息靈通之外交家，均認為柏林封鎖之解除可能成為重大發展之初步。各方如能善為處理，此種新趨勢可能導致結束冷戰。西方國家對於蘇聯在冷戰中所採取之任何新行動，常抱懷疑態度，此次獨不然。美國某方面甚至謂「一種情勢在醞釀中，其氣味不惡。」西方觀察家均謂局勢微妙，新步驟應審慎，更須大加思索。</p>
<h3>德路局準備恢復　柏林客貨運</h3>
<p>解除封鎖已露跡象</p>
<p>〔路透社漢諾威廿七日電〕此間德國鐵路局長索爾多宣稱：路局方面已準備於柏林封鎖解除後，立即開始恢復對柏林之客貨運，將盡先恢復運煤車之行駛。又自柏林駛出之第一輛公共汽車已抵此間，據談當駛抵蘇區邊界時，蘇官員對旅客極為客氣，僅滯留半小時即繼續西駛。按前此自柏林來旅客須在邊界換車。</p>
<h3>西德聯邦共和國　各邦確立分權制</h3>
<p>〔路透社法蘭克福廿七日電〕據悉，將於今夏成立之西德聯邦共和國，其經濟平衡權將操諸中央政府之手，但各邦亦將有相當的行政獨立權，此項分權制度之確立，為社會民主黨在八個月之憲法起草工作中力爭之結果，該黨不顧美法之反對，卒獲克服基督民主黨之堅決反對而達到使德國聯邦共和國經濟權集中之目的。</p>
<h3>艾契遜促美參院　准許大西洋公約　柏林封鎖即解除該約依然需要</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿七日電〕國務卿艾契遜稱：荀柏林之封鎖獲得解除，北大西洋公約之需要依然存在。艾契遜本日就北大西洋公約在參院外交委會中作證，聲稱：蘇聯封鎖德國前首都之問題，乃歐洲重大問題中之一部份。對於美國若干人將美國之政策民蘇聯在歐洲之行動聯係于一起之傾向有所批評。渠指出此將使蘇聯始終保有主動，事實上美國不應受蘇俄之和平攻勢，神經戰或宣傳之影響。有以美國批準大西洋公約後，蘇聯可能採取何種反措置一點提出問題者，國務卿不願有所猜測。渠指出蘇聯反對大西洋公約之宣傳業已加強，抗議之照會亦已發出，渠謂渠料想同樣之行動將繼續進行。在答復其他問題時，艾契遜謂，魯爾區不擬予以恢復，俾作為公約簽字各國軍事供應品之泉源。渠謂德國之解除武裝與廢止軍備將繼續予以進行，此點其為明顯。</p>
<h3>柏林英軍區水閘　一度為蘇聯封鎖</h3>
<p>經英抗議業已解除</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿七日電〕英國軍政府發言人今日稱：蘇軍當局今日封鎖柏林英軍區水閘三處，不準未經蘇聯登記之船隻通過，旋經英方提出抗議後，解除封鎖。蘇聯此種挑釁行動，出於非正式談判解除柏林封鎖時，殊堪驚異。</p>
<h3>柏林開放有望　歐公債激漲</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿七日電〕柏林封鎖解除有望，歐洲公債今日在倫敦證券市場買氣大盛，德國公債搜求尤殷，七厘洋碱公債漲至六十一鎊，六厘半洋碱公債漲至五十五鎊，波蘭，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞與匈牙利公債漲起五先令至十先令不等。其他證券穩定。中國債券亦堅定，金融時報指數為一一五·〇。</p>
<h3>克拉克將繼任　美駐德司令</h3>
<p>克萊可能於一月內返國</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓廿八日廣播：軍界人士預料，克拉克將繼克萊為美駐德軍事總督。預料國防部長約翰遜不久將任命駐德新司令，故克萊可能於一個月內返國休養。克萊回國後或將退休，被提名繼任克萊職位之人尚有陸軍副參謀長魏德邁中將及克萊之副司令胡勃納中將。</p>
<h3>美三軍擬訂雷達偵察網</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社費城廿七日電〕此間今夜宣佈，美武裝部隊業已起草一項雷達偵察網，保衛美國大陸計劃，美國會已撥發必要經費，供實現此項計劃之用。美空軍交通處處長恩芬布朗德告新聞界稱：此項計劃係海陸空三軍合作草成。</p>
<h3>我要求聯大　採用中國語文</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿七日電〕我國駐聯合國代表團，今日促請聯合國大會規定中文為聯合國通用語文，其理由為不應歧視中文。</p>
<h3>英共和聯邦會議結束　各總理紛紛返國　印獨立後不擬効忠英王</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕自治領總理於出席共和聯邦會議畢，已於今日紛紛啟程返國。此次會議就印度與共和聯邦關係所獲致之協議，頗獲共和聯邦各地之好評。新德里來電謂：印度副總理巴泰爾於獲知共和聯邦會議之結果後，表示印國大黨及國會將立即加以批準。坎培拉來電謂，澳洲官方對印度共和國之繼續參加英共和聯邦亦有好評，惟對印度毋須向英王效忠一點尚有保留的意見。加拿大方面認此次新公式之獲得為艾德禮之條件。報紙評論并指出愛爾蘭完全脫離共和聯邦後，共和聯邦似已於瓦解，惟此次關於印度之決定，則可使共和聯邦的聯係得以保持其永久性。倫敦各報對此次新決議莫不表示歡欣，若干且認此例一開，或可誘導愛爾蘭與緬甸重新投入共和聯邦之懷抱，社會黨的開明政策已使英共和聯邦，至少將再存續一世紀之久。</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦廿八日電〕印度利用外交革命，今日決定成為獨立自主共和國，但仍為不列顛聯邦之一份子。印度今夜以宣佈之方式，即獲得脫離不列顛帝國之成果。據公報稱，印度同意繼續承認英王為聯邦獨立份子自由結合之象徵及聯邦之首長。惟公報中并不言及效忠於英王。印度或將於八月間通過新憲法而宣佈為共和國，屆時印度人民大約僅將效忠於印度共和國。政府發言人宣稱，英王將不復委任總督以管理印度，但將派高級專員一人駐印度為其代表。英印雙方協議，多因英總理艾德禮與印總理尼赫魯間之熱忱關係而獲得。</p>
<h3>三強承認敘政府</h3>
<p>〔路透社大馬色廿七日電〕英美法三國政府均已致電敘利亞柴姆上校領導之政府道賀，此舉即為三強之承認敘新政府。</p>
<h3>印巴等總理會晤艾德禮</h3>
<p>非正式商討緬甸問題</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕英共和聯邦諸總理今日在唐寗街十號晤艾德禮首相及貝文，非正式討論緬甸問題。今日在艾德禮首相官邸之會議中，印總理尼赫魯及巴基斯坦總理艾里干，殆已代緬總理泰金諾提出意見，此外并已提出尼氏等本人之意見，此外并已提出尼氏等本人之意見。可靠方面謂，泰金諾已乞尼赫魯等轉懇英國發表關於緬甸之明確聲明，以澄清當前英國對緬之態度。</p>
<h3>菲奎松夫人等　在紐省遇害</h3>
<p>死者共六人傷者十人</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺廿八日電〕菲律賓第一任總統奎松之夫人及女公子，今日在紐伐愛西加省本加旁約六十哩之叢山中遭農民軍製擊斃命，死者共六人，另有十人受傷。此間紅十字會接省長吉奥柯通知，傷者已趕送醫院，用血漿救治。除奎松夫人及其女公子外，遇害者尚有市長巴奈圖，及戰時游擊隊領袖奥古斯丁與奎森平二人。退職參謀長耶蘭杜尼及奎松夫人之第三婿蒲加米諾受傷。</p>
<p>〔又電〕季里諾總統在碧瑤聞悉奎松夫人罹難消息，立即下令出動大隊軍警，捉拿凶手。總統指出凶手為匪徒而非農民軍。</p>
<h3>四外長代表　續商對奥和約</h3>
<p>對德奥財產已獲協議</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕四強外長代表今日在此舉行第一五五次會議，討論奥國和約，在該約尚未獲致協議之十六條中，再就其中一條獲得協議。該條為禁止奥國今後再向德國索還德國併奥前攫取之奥國財產，四外長代表同意在德之奥私人財產，應交還奥人，并議定在今後之對德和約中，亦應規定禁止德國向奥索取奥國取自德國之財產。蘇代表薩魯平對此點持異議，認為德國向外國索取財產之問題，已在四強對德管制協定中規定，故不必再在對德和約中規定，美代表李勃則答以四強對德管制委員會早已停止活動，渠及英法代表均願此點能訂明在對德和約內。</p>
<h3>遠東英軍換防</h3>
<p>〔路透社利物浦廿七日電〕皇家海空軍約一千名暨家屬二百名，今日登輪往新加坡·哥倫坡·香港接防，挽回返國渡假或調回本國之海空軍人員。</p>
<h3>加倫叛軍三千人　攻達科車站　緬政府砲轟英申外圍</h3>
<p>〔合眾社仰光廿七日電〕政府今日宣佈，加倫叛黨估計約三千人，進侵仰光北七十哩之達科車站，其中五百人已被政府軍擊斃，政府出去裝甲部隊，戰事現仍進行中，結果如何，至今夜尚未可決。惟政府發言人表示，深信政府軍可固守貝戈并擊破加倫叛黨之前進，貝戈已在戒嚴中。觀察家認為緬甸整個戰事繫於達科之戰事。同時政府現傾其全力以圖擊破因英申外圍之加倫防綫，故用四時口徑大砲，飛機轟炸及美國製坦克車整日轟擊。聞叛黨一隊現已管理塞頓城。</p>

<h3>生活指數編審委會商定　計薪指數另行編製　採每期調查日二次最高物價平均數</h3>

<h3>國行決酌增　發薪津現鈔</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕月杪發薪之期，轉瞬卽屆。中央銀行為應付各界發薪所需之巨額現鈔，頃已決定仍按本月中旬發薪辦法，按當時九百億元之數，隨月底生活指數倍數酌加，備足現鈔，以應各工廠如期發薪。至於月中曾一度實行之黃金兌換袁頭銀洋辦法，如屆時現鈔不敷所需，而事實有此需要，當再考慮恢復辦理與否。</p>

<h3>Wu Xing and Changxing Voluntarily Withdraw, Triangular Area of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou Completes Deployment, Communist Army on Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway Moves East, Confrontation West of Zhengyi</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 28th] After the Nationalist army's retreat from Wu Xing, communication to Wu Kang, located along the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway, and Hangzhou City was cut off on the 28th. The situation in Wu Kang is unclear. There are reports of Communist guerrillas appearing in Mogan Mountain.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Order in Hangzhou City is currently relatively stable. The Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi roads are still passable, though extremely crowded with passengers. Schools are still in session as usual. The provincial government continues to move to Ningbo, and the Hangzhou Municipal Government is also evacuating dependents to Ningbo.</p>
<p>[Our Jiaxing Dispatch, 10:00 PM, 28th] The Wujiang County Government has withdrawn to Pingwang today, severing contact with Jiaxing. The Nationalist army is deploying defenses to impede the Communist army's advance. The Nationalist army in Changxing has withdrawn from the county seat, moving to more advantageous positions. Wu Xing County Government personnel withdrew to Deqing at 3:00 AM today and lost contact with Jiaxing in the afternoon. The situation in Wu Xing is unclear.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou Dispatch, 28th] (1) Military News: Communist guerrilla activities are harassing the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway. The Nationalist army has voluntarily withdrawn from Yixing, Changxing, and Wu Xing. (2) The Communist army that fled south from Wuxi, after joining forces in Yixing with Communist guerrillas fleeing east from Guangde, continues to advance south. The vanguard has reached Changxing. The Nationalist army has established a pocket-shaped defensive line on both sides of the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway to lure the Communist army deep in, awaiting an opportunity to annihilate them.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Communist army advancing eastward along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, after seizing Suzhou, caused the Communist guerrillas lurking in Taihu Lake to take the opportunity to land and harass the area. Local governments and self-defense forces in Changxing and Wu Xing counties along the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway have voluntarily withdrawn. Telecommunications in the two counties have also been cut off successively. Wu Xing's telephone service was cut off at 3:00 AM on the 28th; the situation within the city is unclear.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Over a thousand Communist guerrillas from Taihu Lake harassed Wu Xing on the night of the 26th. The county's local government and self-defense forces, led by Shi Shuluan, the First District Administrative Inspector, withdrew from the county seat at 3:00 AM on the morning of the 28th and retreated to Deqing. Furthermore, Communist guerrillas are successively harassing the Mogan Mountain area. At 5:00 PM on the 28th, telecommunications to and from Wu Kang County were temporarily cut off. Nationalist army units outside Hangzhou are moving along the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway to engage the Communist army in Wu Kang and Wu Xing. According to military sources, strong Nationalist army forces have completed deployments in the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway and Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou triangular area, awaiting an opportunity to annihilate the enemy. The Communist guerrillas harassing various locations are merely clowns jumping around and are not worth worrying about.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military news at 9:00 AM on the 28th: (1) No bandit activity has been discovered in Zhengyi (i.e., Zheng Yi) Town. Kunshan is stable as usual, but most businesses are closed.

<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] According to the Songhu Garrison Command's battle report at 9:00 PM on April 28th: (1) A regiment of the Communist 29th Army that invaded the vicinity of Suzhou infiltrated northwest of Wujiang from Mu Du at 11:30 AM on the 28th.

(2) A contingent of bandits entrenched in Suzhou, numbering approximately several thousand, fled east along the railway on the 28th, attempting a probing harassment towards the Weiting area.

<h3>The United States Agrees with Britain and France on a Joint Policy Towards China, US Diplomatic Personnel in China Ordered to Remain in Place</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] This side tacitly acknowledges that the United States has reached a joint policy towards China with Britain and France. An authoritative State Department official stated on the 27th that any future relations between US diplomatic personnel and the Chinese Communist Party in areas controlled by the CCP should not be viewed as a preliminary recognition of the CCP government. Since the United States is still maintaining diplomatic operations in Peiping, Tianjin, and Nanjing, it will inevitably have relations with the local CCP authorities. According to international law, such relations might be considered de facto recognition of these local authorities. Officials are extremely tight-lipped about reports that the US government is studying de facto recognition of the CCP government. They emphasize that only after the CCP formally establishes a government is it possible to consider the matter. Authoritative sources point out that the US consulates in Shenyang, Tianjin, and Peiping have not been closed, even though they are not doing any work. At the same time, even though the US ambassador's residence in Nanjing was invaded by the Communist army, the government has not considered closing the embassy or consulates. Therefore, at this time when Chiang Kai-shek has announced that he will continue fighting, the United States is clearly planning to implement a "presence" policy in China.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] A State Department spokesman announced on the 27th that all US diplomatic personnel in China have been ordered to remain in their current locations.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco broadcast on the 28th: The American ship (President Wilson), which may be the last to evacuate overseas Chinese, has left Shanghai for Japan. The US Navy has completely closed its coastal facilities. From now on, the route for foreigners to escape Shanghai will be greatly narrowed.</p>
<h3>Chennault Returns to the US Suddenly, American Press Expresses Surprise</h3>
<p>Rumored to be Invited Back by the State Department</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 28th] Several New York newspaper editorials on the morning of the 28th expressed surprise at General Chennault's return to the country. The newspapers doubted that Chen's visit was a personal vacation. They believed that Chen had been invited to the US to provide the State Department with his opinion on the situation in China. One newspaper believed that Chen's visit was related to the loss of Nanjing and expected that the State Department, which is considering revising its China policy, would listen to Chen's opinion with greater interest than before.</p>
<h3>Hearts of the People in Jiaxing Tense, Decision to Form a Joint Office</h3>
<p>[Our Jiaxing Dispatch, 10:00 PM, 28th] Due to the tense war situation, people from all walks of life in Jiaxing have organized a joint office to stabilize hearts and minds and maintain order. The personnel have been determined, with the selection of a director, a chief secretary, and a deputy chief secretary, under whom will be set up general affairs, liaison, and security sections. The city area is in good order today, but the people's hearts are quite tense. Nationalist army troops are passing through in an endless stream. Prices are rising. Yuan Datou (silver dollars) are 1.2 million, small heads are 850,000, coarse rice is 1 million per stone, white glutinous rice is 1.8 million, and white rice is 1.9 million. The military and civilians are cooperating well under the city defense headquarters. The city defense department notified shops not to close. The situation is still relatively peaceful.</p>
<h3>All Fronts in Central China Quiet, Bai Chongxi Inspects Guishan</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 28th] All fronts in Central China are quiet, and there have been no major engagements so far. Bai Chongxi, accompanied by many staff members, inspected the terrain of Guishan in Hanyang on the 28th and took a short detour to Guiyuan Temple.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Elders of Hubei Province, such as Zhang Nanxian, Li Shucheng, and Geng Bozhao, have been meeting in Wuchang for days, exchanging views widely. After the meeting, they visited Bai Chongxi twice for discussions.</p>
<h3>British Far East Fleet Commander Vian to Return to China, HMS Belfast to Serve as New Flagship</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 28th] Admiral Vian, Commander of the British Far East Fleet, is scheduled to fly back to his post in China on the 28th. Vian returned to England at the beginning of last week to attend a conference at the Greenwich Naval College, but after the British ship on the Yangtze River was bombed, Vian met with Naval Minister Fraser and decided to return to his post. At the same time, the Admiralty has dispatched the 8,000-ton cruiser HMS Jamaica from the Western Pacific to increase the strength of the Far East Fleet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 27th] The British 10,000-ton cruiser HMS Belfast sailed from here to Shanghai on the 27th to serve as the flagship of the British Far East Fleet. HMS Belfast will replace the British ship HMS London, which was damaged on the Yangtze River last week, and is scheduled to arrive in the Shanghai area on Thursday, anchoring near Woosung. US ships are currently anchored there. Vice Admiral Madden, Deputy Commander of the British Far East Fleet, will soon move his staff from HMS London to HMS Belfast. In addition, the British 8,000-ton cruiser HMS Jamaica was ordered three days ago to sail from its base in the West Indies to the Far East, which will increase the total number of British cruisers in the Far East to three.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Incident Strengthens Malayan Communist Activities</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] Lord Mancroft predicted on the 27th that the Communists in Malaya would increase their activities due to the Yangtze River incident. It is said that "the humiliating tragedy on the Yangtze increases the importance of the struggle in Malaya. If the Communists eliminate anti-communist resistance in China, they will inevitably reinforce the communist crowds among the Chinese in Malaya. Malaya is the only part of the British Commonwealth actively fighting communism, and moreover, Malaya is the only country in the world fighting communism and inflicting heavy blows. Britain must give Malaya all possible assistance."</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London broadcast on the 28th: The British government has announced that the British House of Commons will debate the entire situation in China next Thursday, including the Communist shelling of British ships.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Jiaodong (Shandong Peninsula) Actively Stirring</h3>
<p>Minor Engagements on the Outskirts of Qingdao</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao Dispatch, 28th] News from our reporter on the front lines of Jimo: After the breakdown of the peace talks, the Communist bandits in Jiaodong are trying to stir up trouble again. There have been small-scale engagements on the outskirts of Qingdao. Strong Nationalist army units have been dispatched to sweep the area in recent days. Yesterday afternoon, they encountered the reconnaissance battalion of the Communist 32nd Army in the Xiaoqiao Sunjiatun area north of Jimo. The Nationalist army annihilated the entire force, capturing over 20 alive and seizing over 50 rifles, 4 machine guns, and over 20 submachine guns. When the reporter saw the prisoners, he found many children.</p>

<h3>US Reaction to President Chiang's Proclamation Varies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] US officials and congressional leaders, in their reactions to President Chiang's proclamation on the 27th, stated that Chiang will devote himself to the struggle against the Communist Party. Supporters of Nationalist China believe that Chiang's proclamation is his courageous will to rally the people. Opponents believe that his proclamation is mere empty talk. Democratic Senator Humphrey said, "I hope what Chiang said about achieving victory within three years is correct. What he has announced is a noble purpose." Observers generally said that the proclamation did not state whether he would resume his actual leadership or simply express approval of Acting President Li and Premier He. Those familiar with the situation in China believe that Chiang announced his support for Li and He. Chinese sources said that the "three years" mentioned in the proclamation may be an expression and does not refer to three years. They explained that "three years" is the shortest time frame that Chinese people use in this kind of situation. Observers said that Chiang's proclamation is telling all those loyal to Chiang to also be loyal to Li and He. They expect that when the line of resistance is well laid out in southern China, Chiang can be expected to take over the leadership of the defense.</p>

<h3>"Mother of Guerrillas" Zhao Laotaitai Escapes Danger; Today Flies from Qingdao to Shanghai, then to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 28th] Zhao Hongwenguo, the elderly Mrs. Zhao, known as the "Mother of Guerrillas," recently escaped danger from Pingdu and arrived here. The women's community of Qingdao held a tea party this afternoon to welcome her. She is from Andong Yan County, now 69 years old. Her eldest son, Zhao Lianjun, was killed by the Japanese in the Northeast on the 28th. Her second son, Zhao Tong, was killed by the communists in the same year. Her third daughter, Zhao Lizhong, was also killed in Zanhuang County, Hebei. After the "September 18th" Incident, Mrs. Zhao helped her second son, Zhao Tong, organize volunteer troops in her hometown. Later, under Japanese pressure, she fled to Beiping. After the outbreak of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, she helped Zhao Tong organize guerrillas in the suburbs of Beiping, personally transporting ammunition and intelligence. The Japanese pursued her too closely, making it impossible to establish a foothold in Beiping. She moved to Jigong Mountain in Henan and organized a guerrilla force of more than forty people. After crossing the Yellow River northward, the number grew to more than two thousand. Later, the Japanese army concentrated all its forces to encircle and suppress them, and only nine people remained in the entire team. She then continued to organize guerrillas in Hankou and went north for the second time. The highest authorities, considering that Mrs. Zhao was too old to endure hardship, asked her to stay in the rear and carry out propaganda work until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. This time, she witnessed the actions of the communists in Beiping and was greatly disappointed. She then fled with her fourth son, Zhao Zhenzhong. She is scheduled to fly to Shanghai tomorrow and then transfer to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>The Peace Negotiation Delegation Failed to Return South; The Executive Yuan Announces the Truth; Person in Charge Says the Delegation Has Been Effectively Detained; Five Representatives' Letter to President He Is Published</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 28th] Since the Communist Party sabotaged the peace talks, all parties have been extremely concerned about when the government's peace negotiation delegation will return south. For this reason, the reporter inquired with responsible persons of the Executive Yuan and learned that after Mao Zedong and Zhu De sabotaged the peace talks on the 21st of this month by issuing a general offensive order, Acting President Li and President He of the government telegraphed the Beiping peace negotiation delegation on the 22nd, informing them that a plane would be sent to pick them up and instructing them to contact the Communist side to arrange a departure date. On the evening of the 22nd, Acting President Li also spoke to Mr. Zhang Zhizhong on a long-distance telephone, informing him that a plane would be sent the next day, until the special plane was recalled from the air. On the 24th, the government again sent a plane from Shanghai to Beiping. President He also entrusted Mr. Li Mingxin, who was taking the plane to Beiping, to carry letters addressed separately to Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, and others, hoping that they would return south immediately. When the plane flew back from Beiping on the 25th, it carried back a letter signed by five representatives, including Zhang Zhizhong, stating that the Communist side had expressed "resolute retention and unwillingness to agree" regarding the government's peace negotiation delegation being recalled to the south. In this situation, it is sufficient to prove that the government's peace negotiation representatives in Beiping have been effectively detained by the Communist Party. Therefore, the Executive Yuan decided at the Yuan meeting on the 27th to revoke the name of the peace negotiation delegation. In the future, the Communist Party may use the name of the government's peace negotiation representatives to carry out malicious propaganda. In an environment where the representatives have lost their freedom, any remarks issued in their name will undoubtedly be false. In order to explain the truth of the matter, the five representatives' personal letter is specially published below: "Respected President He: Mr. Li Mingxin brought your note (of the 23rd), which we have received with respect. After the breakdown of the peace talks, we were awaiting orders to return south. In the evening of the 22nd, we received a telephone call from De Gong (Li Zongren), stating that a plane would be sent to Beiping the next day. We immediately informed our colleagues and prepared to go south, and immediately sent a letter to the Communist side for their information. Subsequently, Zhou Enlai, Lin Zuhan, Li Lisan, and others visited us separately, resolutely urging us to stay. We telegraphed Nanjing twice on the 22nd and 23rd, and made telephone inquiries in the morning of the 23rd, but were unable to get through. Yesterday, we read that the Central Company had a plane coming to Beiping, and we again consulted with the Communist side, stating our reasons for needing to return south, hoping that they would agree. However, Zhou still resolutely urged us to stay and was unwilling to agree. In this situation, we can only stay temporarily and wait quietly, hoping for your understanding. Furthermore, we failed to complete our mission on this trip, but we are deeply ashamed and grateful for the letters and telegrams of comfort from Acting President Li and you, sir. Please also convey our sentiments to De Gong. With respectful greetings, Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Zhang Shizhao, Li Zheng, Liu Fei, respectfully. At one o'clock in the morning of April 25th."</p>

<h3>Editorial: Reforming Politics to Save the Nation from Peril</h3>
<p>The peace talks in Beiping, which lasted for more than a month, have unfortunately broken down, and the Communist army, which was stationed north of the Yangtze River, has forcibly crossed the river, and the war has moved from the north bank of the Yangtze River to the south. The resumption of civil war not only greatly disappoints the people who longed for peace, but also makes the people of the south feel even heavier; coupled with the fact that the Communist army's general offensive has lasted less than a few days, the National Army has successively abandoned cities such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou due to strategic reasons. The flames of war are gradually moving eastward, less than seventy kilometers away from Shanghai. The rapid turn for the worse in the military situation has made the citizens of Shanghai panic, and they are in a state of anxiety. The streets and alleys are filled with wartime scenes, the airport, the ship docks are crowded with people, piled high with luggage, everyone wants to be the first to fly away; not to mention the residents of the suburbs of Shanghai, who are also supporting the old and carrying the young, carrying baskets and suitcases, moving into the urban area, heading to what they think is a safe place. No matter how clear his reason is, no matter how strong his will is, in the face of the current situation of turmoil and shock, he cannot help but feel frightened and sleepless, and even if he wants to remain calm, he cannot. Therefore, everyone thinks that a great disaster is imminent, and the country has reached the final moment, but they do not know how to save themselves and save the country from peril. Therefore, the people's hearts are filled with anxiety, worry, distress, and bewilderment.</p>
<p>But after reading President Chiang's "Letter to the People of the Whole Country" yesterday, the people's feelings of anxiety, worry, distress, and bewilderment suddenly disappeared. It made the people of the whole country understand that although the sky is covered with haze, President Chiang also admits the seriousness of the current situation, and even predicts that the situation will worsen in the future; but the future of the country is bright, and there will be a day when the crisis turns into safety, and the sunshine of peace will surely dispel the war and haze and shine brightly. However, whether a turning point can come depends on the joint efforts of the entire nation, especially the people's efforts to save the nation from peril. After reading President Chiang's proclamation, we were filled with emotion, and we really didn't know where to start; but speaking from the people's standpoint, we couldn't help but hope that the government would earnestly abide by President Chiang's instructions, redouble its efforts, so that this battered ship could weather the storm and safely reach the other shore.</p>
<p>President Chiang said: "Today, as long as our compatriots across the country rise up together, support the government, urge the government, so that politics has timely reforms, the economy has a certain direction, and military and political cadres can thoroughly awaken and strengthen the organization; as long as we accept the lessons of failure, so that failure becomes a tempering and refining, ... I am deeply convinced that the opportunity for our country to turn from danger to safety is today." This passage, although said to the people of the whole country, is actually aimed at the government. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War four years ago, the military has suffered successive defeats, from the Northeast to North China, from north of the Yangtze River to the south. After each military defeat, the government always reiterated its determination to reform politics, but each time the result was always disappointing to the people, and the checks that were issued were never cashed, and the style remained the same. Now it has reached the final moment, and the military cannot afford to fail again, otherwise the country will fall into an irrecoverable situation; but everyone knows that politics, military affairs, and economy are three-in-one, and cannot be separated. If the government still cannot make a painful decision and thoroughly reform, so that the whole country has a new look, then it will still be difficult for the military to have hope of turning from weakness to strength. Failure is not worth worrying about, especially the victory or defeat in military affairs, in the eyes of military experts, it is commonplace, and there is no need to fear. Everyone knows the saying "Failure is the mother of success"; but the most terrible thing is "not knowing shame" and "not being able to accept the lessons of failure." Government officials should be particularly vigilant about the President's instructions and reflect on them a lot.</p>
<p>In short, military failure is not worth worrying about, the most worrying thing is still the lack of political reform. Let's take a historical example. Le Yi attacked Qi and captured more than seventy cities in a row, leaving only the two cities of Ju and Jimo; but when Tian Dan came out, he restored the old mountains and rivers of Qi. Comparing the past with the present is like comparing the present with the past. We should not be pessimistic, but should be active and enterprising, make a painful decision, and reform politics, and we will eventually be able to achieve the task of saving the nation from peril. Therefore, whether the country can turn from danger to safety in the future will also depend on whether the current government can accept the lessons of failure and thoroughly reform politics. President Chiang said: "The failures of the past were caused by our political shortcomings, economic panic, and the laxity of internal organization"; these self-critical maxims are most worthy of deep reflection by the officials in power. The time is urgent and has reached the final moment, and the entire nation should rise up and save the situation. This is the time.</p>
<h3>The United States and the Soviet Union Negotiate to Lift the Berlin Blockade, Reaching the Final Decision Stage; The United States Asks the Soviet Union to Submit a Definite Timetable; Jessup and Malik Held Secret Talks for Ninety-Two Minutes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Negotiations between the East and West on lifting the Berlin blockade reached the final decision stage today, and the next action is entirely up to the Soviet Union. It is expected that the Soviet Union will soon respond to the questions of the United States, Britain, and France, that is, whether the only condition for the Soviet Union to end the Berlin blockade is that the United States, Britain, and France agree to hold a meeting of the four foreign ministers. The United States, Britain, and France have indicated that they are willing to attend the meeting once Berlin returns to normal.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 27th] The United States has asked the Soviet Union today to issue a formal statement stating when and under what conditions the Soviet Union will lift the Berlin blockade. The US representative to the United Nations, Jessup, made this request to the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and representative to the United Nations, Malik, tonight, stating that its main purpose was to put the Berlin negotiations on a formal basis and to record the Soviet Union's views in formal documents. The note also specifically asked the Soviet Union to explain the scope of the lifting of the Berlin blockade and the timetable for lifting the blockade. Previously, sources revealed that the US and Soviet representatives were discussing this issue. The US representative will reiterate the positions of the United States, Britain, and France on lifting the blockade and convening a meeting of foreign ministers. Officials here are cautiously optimistic about this matter, believing that the lifting of the Berlin blockade and the convening of a meeting of foreign ministers are expected to be realized within one to two months.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] US Representative Jessup and Soviet Deputy Foreign Ministers Gromyko and Malik held secret talks for ninety-two minutes this morning on the third floor of the Soviet delegation office on Upper Pike Road. It is reported that Mr. Jessup presented a memorandum requesting the Soviet Union to clearly explain the conditions for lifting the Berlin blockade. According to a spokesman for the US delegation, what Mr. Jessup presented was not a note in diplomatic terms. Mr. Jessup only read a pre-prepared document, and left the document behind before leaving, asking the Soviet side to respond in writing. Mr. Jessup arrived at the Soviet delegation office alone by car, and entered through the iron gate, and there was no news. After the meeting, he returned to the US delegation office alone. A few minutes later, Gromyko went to Success Lake to attend a committee of the United Nations General Assembly, keeping silent about the content of the secret talks. When reporters asked Malik if there was any news to announce, he replied no, and when the next negotiation will be held is also unknown. The US side said that the talks are only informal in nature so far, and the date of the next negotiation can be arranged temporarily by telephone.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, New York, 27th] After meeting with Malik, Mr. Jessup immediately consulted with British and French officials in New York, and then returned to Washington. Previously, Mr. Jessup had consulted with the US Chief Representative to the United Nations, Austin, and other members of the delegation that day. It is still unknown what the outcome of the negotiations between Malik and Jessup will be, but United Nations officials welcomed the fact that the two sides used the United Nations' convenience here. United Nations Secretary-General Lai Yi said: "The whole world will welcome the smooth outcome of this effort to break the Berlin deadlock and the convening of another meeting of foreign ministers. I think most people will also feel gratified that the two major countries are using the path of the United Nations, and the efforts of the two countries to successfully complete the agreement in 1945 led to the establishment of the United Nations."</p>
<h3>Representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union May Hold a Meeting Within the Week to Determine the Date of Lifting the Berlin Blockade and Holding a Meeting of Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] New York, 28th, broadcast: Success Lake report: Western diplomats expect that representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will hold talks within the week to determine the date of lifting the Berlin blockade and convening a meeting of the four powers' foreign ministers. They expect the foreign ministers' meeting to be held in Paris in the last week of May.</p>
<p>They confirmed that the Soviet representative, Malik, had verbally assured the US representative, Jessup, that if the Western countries agreed to lift the counter-blockade at the same time, the Soviet Union would definitely lift the Berlin blockade and agree to convene a meeting of the four powers' foreign ministers on a regular basis. Malik asked for time to obtain formal approval from Vyshinsky. Malik arrived in Flushing to attend a plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, and avoided answering questions about the progress of the Berlin issue negotiations, but when asked if he was optimistic, Malik replied: "We Soviets have always been optimistic."</p>
<h3>US Assistant Secretary of State Meets with Gromyko for Informal Talks on the Berlin Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] US Assistant Secretary of State Rusk flew from Washington to New York today to meet with Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister and Chief Representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Gromyko, to hold informal talks on the Berlin blockade issue. Since the US Representative to the United Nations, Jessup, and the Soviet Representative to the United Nations, Malik, have already exchanged views on this matter, the meeting between Rusk and Gromyko is a contact between the two countries at a higher level on this matter.</p>
<h3>During Negotiations Between the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Mood in Moscow Is Excellent; Relations Between the Four Powers Will Enter a New Stage</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 27th] The general mood here today is that relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France can be improved and reach a new post-war stage. Although no one can predict what kind of liberation methods will be established in addition to lifting the Berlin blockade, well-informed diplomats believe that the lifting of the Berlin blockade may become the beginning of a major development. If all parties can handle it well, this new trend may lead to the end of the Cold War. Western countries are often skeptical of any new actions taken by the Soviet Union in the Cold War, but this time is an exception. Some aspects of the United States even said, "A situation is brewing, and its smell is not bad." Western observers say that the situation is delicate, and new steps should be taken cautiously and with more thought.</p>

<h3>The States of the Federal Republic of West Germany Establish a System of Separation of Powers</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 27th] It is reported that the economic balancing power of the Federal Republic of West Germany, which will be established this summer, will be in the hands of the central government, but the states will also have considerable administrative independence.

<h3>Acheson Urges the US Senate to Approve the Atlantic Treaty; The Treaty Is Still Needed Even If the Berlin Blockade Is Lifted</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 27th] Secretary of State Acheson said: Even if the Berlin blockade is lifted, the need for the North Atlantic Treaty still exists. Acheson testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the North Atlantic Treaty today, stating that the issue of the Soviet blockade of the former capital of Germany is one part of the major problems in Europe. He criticized the tendency of some people in the United States to link the policies of the United States and the actions of the Soviet Union in Europe. He pointed out that this would allow the Soviet Union to always maintain the initiative, and in fact the United States should not be affected by the Soviet Union's peace offensive, nerve warfare, or propaganda. When asked what countermeasures the Soviet Union might take after the United States approved the Atlantic Treaty, the Secretary of State was unwilling to speculate. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's propaganda against the Atlantic Treaty has been strengthened, and protests have been issued, and he said that he expects the same actions to continue. In response to other questions, Acheson said that the Ruhr area is not intended to be restored as a source of military supplies for the signatory countries to the treaty. He said that the disarmament and abolition of armaments in Germany will continue to be carried out, and this is obvious.</p>

<h3>British Commonwealth Conference Ends, Prime Ministers Return Home One After Another; India Does Not Intend to Pledge Allegiance to the British Monarch After Independence</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The Prime Ministers of the Dominions, after attending the Commonwealth Conference, departed for home one after another today. The agreement reached at this meeting on the relationship between India and the Commonwealth has been well received in various parts of the Commonwealth. A dispatch from New Delhi said that after learning of the results of the Commonwealth Conference, Indian Deputy Prime Minister Patel said that the Indian National Congress and the Parliament would approve it immediately. A dispatch from Canberra said that the Australian government also praised India's continued participation in the British Commonwealth, but reserved its opinion on the point that India does not have to pledge allegiance to the British monarch. Canadian sources believe that the acquisition of this new formula is Addlee's condition. Newspaper commentary also pointed out that after Ireland completely separated from the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth seemed to be disintegrating, but this decision on India can maintain the permanence of the Commonwealth's ties. The London newspapers all expressed joy at this new resolution, and some even believed that this precedent could induce Ireland and Burma to rejoin the embrace of the Commonwealth. The Social Party's enlightened policy has made the British Commonwealth last for at least another century.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] India used diplomatic revolution to decide today to become an independent and autonomous republic, but still be a part of the British Commonwealth.

India may adopt a new constitution in August and declare itself a republic, at which time the Indian people will probably only pledge allegiance to the Republic of India. A government spokesman declared that the British monarch would no longer appoint a governor-general to administer India, but would send a high commissioner to India as his representative. The Anglo-Indian agreement was mostly obtained due to the warm relationship between British Prime Minister Addlee and Indian Prime Minister Nehru.</p>

The four Foreign Minister representatives agreed that Austrian private property in Germany should be returned to the Austrians and stipulated that the future Treaty with Germany should also prohibit Germany from claiming from Austria property taken from Germany by Austria.

<h3>Living Index Compilation Review Committee Agrees to Compile Separate Salary Index; Adopts Average of Twice-Daily Highest Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Living Expense Index Compilation Review Committee held a meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Industry Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the Statistics Office, and the Social Affairs Bureau, a total of more than ten people, attended. During the meeting, all representatives agreed that the compilation of the living expense index was absolutely correct. However, due to the recent soaring prices, the gap between wages and prices has widened, and workers are finding it increasingly difficult to make a living. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the salary system and payment methods. After discussion between labor and management representatives, it was decided that the living index for each period would still be compiled and published according to the original method, and the original average index would continue to be published in order to conform to scientific principles. As for the salary standard, a separate "Salary Index" will be compiled, and the average of the two highest commodity prices on the survey day for each period will be used as the commodity price adopted by the "Salary Index", so that the wages converted by the salary index in the future can be closer to the commodity prices. As for how to determine the standard for the highest commodity survey day for each period, it is proposed to submit it to the Municipal Government Conference for decision.</p>

<h3>Chinese Stock Trading Becomes More Quiet; Bids All Reach Upper Price Limits</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Chinese stock market situation yesterday was such that, due to the emergence of large denomination banknotes, the money supply in the market eased, and the turnover of funds was relatively flexible. Moreover, as commodity prices outside the stock market have recently soared, confidence in the stock market has been revitalized. However, due to the overall situation, trading has become increasingly quiet, with total turnover for the day only reaching 33.5 million shares. The stocks that were actually traded included only thirteen types: Wing On Textile, China General Edison, Qin Hsing, New Kwong, King Fook, Mei Ah, Wing Fung, Wah Chi, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Wing On Company, National Products, Chapei Water &amp; Electricity, and Taiwan Sugar. The rest still had no bids.</p>
<p>Wing On Textile opened in the morning at $330, with bulls holding firm, and bids reached the upper price limit of $357. Outside the market, margin trading began, initially with a premium of $20 sought, then rising to $30, and $35. After Wing On Textile reached its limit, other stocks successively opened with bids, all reaching their upper price limits, and the market closed near noon without further trading.</p>
