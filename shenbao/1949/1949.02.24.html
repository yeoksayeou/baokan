<h3>行政院在穗舉行會議　通過財經改革方案　公教人中待遇三月份起再度調整　梧州列為對外貿易口岸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟改革新方案，昨經在廣州舉行之行政院政務會議中通過，內容尙未公布，但本市金融界盛傳：未來銀元一元將規定折合金圓券一千二百元，黃金一兩値銀圓一百元，美金一元折合銀圓二元。此項傳聞未能證實，但有關方面表示略有根據。又，國行總裁劉攻芸在穗公畢，將於日內赴港一行，與有力方面洽商，蓋新方案之實行，有賴各方合作也。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州廿三日電〕行政院廿三日上下午廣續在穗舉行第四十五次會議，孫院長主席，出席吳副院長及各部會首畏，通過重要議案如次：</p>
<p>討論事項：（一）政府爲解除當前財政經濟之困難，幷改善人民生活起見，經財政部徐部長，龐主計長與有關各機關會商，擬具財政經濟改革方案，經決議修正通過，呈請總統引用臨時條款，先行公布實施，再據以修芷有關法案，補充立法程序。（二）健全組織，整飭紀綱，首應調整機構，統一事權，庶幾效率提高，手續簡化，當經決議原則通過，先從行政院着手調整，合理裁併，由院長，副院長決定後，咨送立法院通過實施。（三）公敎人員待遇二月份雖普經調整，嗣以物價又漲，仍感不敷，廿三日經決議，三月份調整待遇，交由財政主計兩部，迅擬呈核。至中央遷移各機關員工伙食補助費，三月份仍照二月份數額，分別發給。此外，原有配給實物制度，政府遷穗後，應如何籌發，亦經決定由各主管機關會商，迅擬呈核。（四）財政部提議：梧州在戰前原係通商口岸，中外輪船均可自該口岸裝載貨物報運出口，或經外洋輪載貨物至該口岸，報運進口，惟戰後政府規定海外商運貿易口岸，該口岸未經列入，因此，梧州與港。澳之直接商運貿易，遂吿停止。梧州商民輸出土產，必須輾轉由粵海關報運輸出，而轍入洋貨亦須中粵海關報運進口後，轉運梧州，桂省商民鑒於該口岸貿易衰落，迭經請由該省參議會及省政府，轉請開放該口岸，衡諸目前態勢，已非往昔可比，爲適應當前需要，促進出口貿易，爭取外匯計，擬將梧州規定爲對外貿易開放口岸，使廣西土產能直接自梧州出口，港·澳外貨能直接自梧州進口，對全國經濟則均大有裨益，決議通過。</p>

<p>〔聯合社北平廿三日電〕據悉：顏息慶與邵力子昨赴石家莊「觀光」，同行者有華北人民政府官員數人，</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社香港廿三日電〕據此問來自華北之消息，否認最近外國通訊社方面所傳之消息，謂毛澤東已與邵力子會晤。又稱，如有此項會議舉行，其目的亦僅爲對毛澤東提供某項意見而已</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿三日電〕某高級官方人士，證實報載國共雙方在北平的初步接觸已獲有顯著進展的消息。然在另一方面，雖然李代總統曾親自赴穗，以圖彌補京穗間的裂痕，但其進展尙不足支持和談前途的開朗。又可靠方面稱，邵力子曾致電李宗仁，報吿渠在平與中共當局會談的詳情，確實的內容雖未透露，但據稱，報吿中以樂觀之語調稱，關於拉攏雙方距離的努力，已獲進屢</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社香港廿三日電〕吳裕後敎授宣布，渠將於廿四日晨返穗，不再與港方共黨及自由分十接觸，因渠等拒絕接見，渠與其同伴兩人接見記者時宣稱，李宗仁與孫科贊同渠等之和平運動，但未提及渠等究代表何種組織，港報指渠等係國民黨青年團之導師，而其同伴兩人則被月爲係前警官。</p>
<h3>西南軍檢會揭幕</h3>

<p>王寵惠卽前往辦公</p>
<p>〔本報廣州廿三日電〕據悉：司法院經決定設中山縣竹秀圓，王寵惠院長日內卽前往正式開始辦公。王氏對中共所提「戰犯」問題，認爲此屬創聞。氏又稱，全國廿四個特刑庭，經明令撤銷，未判決之政治犯，亦已完全釋放，至已判決者，俟李代總統批准後，卽可獲赦。</p>
<h3>立委昨開談話會　建議月內興行復會式　關於「集中討論」問題另行研究</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕到京立委廿三日下午三時曾舉行談話會，交換有關各項問題之意見，出席立委廿餘人，楊幼烔主席。由滬·杭兩地來京之黃正之·許蟠雲·程元斟等，先後報吿滬·杭兩地立委意見。董氏稱：在杭立委可能有卅人於廿西日來京，黃字人認爲，立院値此非常時期，集會應一改平時方式，實行集中討論，先就（一）和平問題，（二）是否需要移地開會問題，（三）新行政院之施政方針問題，（四）當前迫切需要改革之問題，如物價與公敎人員待遇等。許蟠雲同意共同氏主張，惟謂：當前重心應為（一）和平問題，（二）改革幣制問題，（三）整肅官常軍紀問題，渠並希望秘書處凖備資料，以備討論。會中當認爲關於集中討論問題，應另開談話會硏究。至復會日期，則一致同意向童院長提出建議，希望於月內舉行復會儀式，然後再定期開議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕立法院第三會期，於本月內在京復會，殆已不成問題。到京立委以憲法規定，立院應於二月集會，立院不應違憲。廿三日決定建議院長童冠賢，於月內決定日期，舉行復會儀式，而正式開議，則不妨延緩數日，以促團結。至在穗立委之不同意見，並無若何嚴重性。童院長廿二日曾與廣州通長途電話，獲知在穗立委並非完全反對在京開會，彼等主張不必匆促卽行議事，最好能緩數日，以待彼等獲得交通工具北上。立委報到，廿三日繼續進行中。廿三報到者，有王又席·許繙雲·羅霞天·程元斟·陸關廷·白建民·馬書城·黃正之等八人，多係來自滬·杭兩地，運前共達五十六人。據廿三日獲悉：在漢·桂立委已洽妥飛機，廿四日或廿五日均可抵京。滬·杭兩地立委則將自廿四日起逐日到達，預計月底以前到京。立委可到達五分之一以上的一五六人之法定人數。</p>
<h3>留穗立委請緩復會　童冠賢覆電解釋</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕留穗立委聯誼會致立法院院長童冠賢養（廿二日）電，對該院在京復會事，表示異見，意氏廿三日特電覆，說明原因，略謂：頃由中央社新聞拜讀留穗立委聯誼會致弟公開電一作，語重心長，略謂：日前通吿在京復會，係謹遵多數同仁意見，依據目前南京治安情形及憲法規定，始作決定。至於復會時間，按照目前交通狀况，同仁散在各地，通吿日期實已不容再緩，擬俟依法如期復會後，商請到會同仁關於重大議題稍緩時日，留待遠道同仁到京後共同討論。</p>
<h3>立委鄒志奪等　交換復會意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕留穗立委推派分赴各地之委員鄒志奮·陳紫楓·吳雲鵬·林棟·潘朝英·何佐治等六人，廿三日午自穗飛抵滬，並卽與留滬立委對復會地點問題交換意見，同時致電在京忙於籌備復會事宜之院長童冠賢，請尊重留穗立委意見，對復會地點進行投票決定之手續。又彼等抵滬後極爲忙碌，廿四日下午三時將於新生活俱樂部續與留滬立委討論立院復會問題。</p>
<h3>中共「建都」北平　以董必武為行政首腦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據北平中共電台廣搖稱：中共之「華北人民政府」已於本月廿日正式移入北平辦公，辦公應暫設西皮市街北平銀行公會舊址。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿三日電〕中共業已正式成立爲一個政府，幷以北平爲其首都，中共正在採取各種步驟，使這個滿淸的故都，文化和政治中心成爲中共所控制的華北的行政中心。正式的公佈已於廿三日發出，「政府」已自石家莊移到北平。但根據中共所發之吿示，此一移都行動，係於二月二十日起。該吿示並附有數條細則，主要署爲中共中委董必武將爲此間行政區之首畏。</p>
<p>至於此次中共移都將是否影響到上海和平代表團與中共領袖間進行和談之時間及其他部署，尙不能立卽獲悉。此間迄今業已設立之各行政部門，包括內政·敎育·財政·工商·農業·公共企業·交通·公共衛生部·公安·司法等部。（據聯合社電：則爲民政·敎育·財政·農務·工商·交通·衛生·司法及勞工等九部。此外並有華北財政經濟公司，華北水利局，華北人民法庭及華北人民銀行）。至此，中共政府已正式地自去年九月廿日在石家莊成立後移至北平。除開董必武將爲行政當局首腦外，其他中共高級領袖並未被提及，至少一時不會提及。至於毛澤東將担任何職及行止，亦未被明顯地指出。同時毫無疑義地，毛氏將繼續全權指導中共政策。該項吿示亦未提及此舉將是否影響上海和平代表團將赴石家莊與毛澤東會議之預定計劃。</p>
<p>此間各報經常以若千地位，刊載國共可能尋覓一共通點，藉以導使和平談判之基礎之事，廿三日各報對此事以極少的地位刊載之。今日各報着重於「新政府」對「對外」貿易熊度之計劃·邵力子顏惠慶及其他上海代表團業已飛赴石家莊會晤毛氏抑中共移都決議，業已使原來計劃延宕未見宣佈。</p>
<p>一般僉信中共將不久宣佈一計劃，卽外商及華商代表可准允來平，經營華北與中國其他各地及外國間之商業。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕據北平廿三日消息：北平軍管會十九日接管故宮博物院。</p>
<h3>孫內閣施政方針決定　主實行地方分權　立院集會時即提出報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕據甫目廣州歸來之某政委談，孫內閣之施政方針，已在穗由孫院長召集重要閣員數度商討，原則業已決定，立法院集會時，卽可提出報吿，該方針中除說明政府對和平之主張外，並特別强調內政革新之重要要點約有下列數項：（一）實行地方分權，加强地方權力，逐漸實現憲法上地方自治之理想。（二）改革幣制，整頓稅收，改善財政狀况。（三）整編軍隊，改善士兵待遇。（四）裁併不必要機構，减少開支，卽將於最近政務會議中提出討論。</p>
<h3>李代總統改今飛湘　對是否赴北平尚未加考慮　桂林歡迎會因雨停止舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報桂林廿三日電〕李代總統廿三日晨七時半召見省府秘書長以下人員多所訓勉，原定九時出席市民歡迎大會訓話，因雨停止，代總　抽閒返兩江鄕故居祭阻，父老携幼沐雨歡迎，留桂國代廿三日向代總統呈遞意見書，內容要點爲撤銷戡委會，修改憲法第一七四條，革新政治，穩定金融，改善公敎待遇。代總統定廿四日飛長沙。</p>
<p>〔中央社長沙廿三日電〕李代總統南巡　。桂席途，擬順道蒞湘巡視，此間簡訊，至感興奮，刻正籌備盛大歡迎。</p>
<p>黃雪邨局長代答記者問</p>
<p>〔中央社桂林廿三日電〕李代總統原定廿二日下午四時接見本市各報記者，嗣以事忙，改由總統府第二局長黃雪邨代爲接見，問答如次：</p>
<p>問，代總統此次南巡意義如何？</p>
<p>答，意在到各地巡視，在穗曾以書面談話說明。</p>
<p>問，和平前途如何？</p>
<p>答，和平爲全國人民一致之要求，當非一蹴可成，須加倍努力且須特別忍耐，始可實現，代總統對此極具信心，相信將來必可獲致成功。</p>
<p>問，人民和平代表團日來在平與共方接觸，有何收獲？</p>
<p>答，尙朱接到正確消息。</p>
<p>問，報載新華社廣播中共領袖毛澤東歡迎代總統赴平，代總統是否準備前往？</p>
<p>答，代總統對此事尙未加考慮。</p>
<p>問，共軍又在江北作新部署，有否渡江南犯企圖？</p>
<p>答，據毛澤東廣播，和平未實現前，軍事行動決不停止，由此看來，不能說其無南犯意圖，和平正在加緊進行，希望共軍渡江不致成爲事實。</p>
<p>問，政院在穗例會有何重要決議？</p>
<p>答，會討諭經濟改革問題，且決定一新方案，不日可公布。</p>
<p>問，該項方案內容可見吿否？</p>
<p>答，尙未至發表時期。最後黃氏並云，孫院長決於日內赴京。</p>
<h3>接見記者答覆詢問　爽郞愉快談話風生　張治中談和平前途　人人要和平一定會成功　北平去否現在還談不到</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕政府和談代表張治中將軍，於廿三日下午五時在沈舉人巷私邸接見往訪之各報記者，答復各項詢問，各報記者前往者達三十餘人，張氏之會客室中爲之坐無虛席，首都玫治空氣沉寂以來數十記者齊集一處者，月餘以來尙屬首次。張氏於五時正進入會客室，着長袍馬褂，狀至瀟洒。答復記者詢問，談笑風生，有時並作爽朗笑聲，空氣甚爲活潑愉快。答問歷一小時始畢，對於當前一般人所最囑目之（一）和談問題，（二）西北問題，（三）中蘇有關新疆之通商及經濟合作條約問題，均曾提出作答，最後並對行政院南遷問題，答問時亦會有所論及。</p>
<p>答復關於和談問題時，張氏仍持其一貫之樂觀看法。謂：我向來樂觀，對一切事我向來都是樂觀的。有記者詢以樂觀之理由？張氏笑謂：樂觀就是樂觀，理由可以不求甚解。旋卽加以解释：「這很明顯，現在不只是我們要和平，而是人民要和平，全世界也都要和平，共產黨難道不要和平嗎？大家都要和平，和平最後一定是會成功的。國共兩黨鬥爭了廿年，當然和談不會沒有波折，但最後還長樂觀的」。有記者問其何以請辭和談代表，請辭之原因是否因爲對和談悲觀時，張氏迅卽答日：「否！因爲一個人挑不起兩倘擔子，在西北時大家都不願意我離開西北，都不贊成我做和談代表，因爲我做了和談代表，西北的事就不能顧及了」。張氏對於墾辭代表之解釋稱：「但如中央一定要我做，我也沒有辦法，我希望中央可以不要我做」。答復其最近是否去北平問題時，張氏稱：「現在還談不到，也許等邵先生回來後才能定，邵先生去平前，在滬時曾有電報至閘州，說他已決計去平，「毀　得失在所不計』希望我能够來京；到北平後還沒有什麼消息回來」。有記者進一步追問：「假如李代總統請張先生現在去北平，你是否願意去」？張氏仍謂：「現在還談不到，假如，到那時候我再給你一個假如的答復」。張氏對於中共兩次廣播中，曾對渠有所批評，表示還是保持「一聲不響」。記者詢以對中共八項和平條件之看法時，張氏表示不願發表意見。有記者問以對戰犯問題看法如何？張氏含笑反問該記者曰：「你是不是戰犯」？言訖開堂。</p>
<p>西北經濟方案　呈請中央核示</p>
<p>關於西北問題，張氏於答問中首先聲明西北軍政會議僅係大家就大局及西北問題交換意見，外傳曾有何項決議及某人主戰，茶人反對和談之說，均完全不確，他們的意見很好，完全尊重中央和平之決策。關於西北之經濟問題，西北曾擬訂一種西北經濟應變方案，已携來呈請中央核示，方案中曾有由西北各省自鑄銀幣之擬議，以謀安定西北幣値，並謀西北經濟上之自力更生，但如中央不予核准，自然仍不能實行，此並非西北始作俑者，事實上有許多省份已在進行，西北各省目前商業上已以硬幣計算，金元券貶値，人民已不信任，硬幣之製迭實自有其必要也。</p>
<p>對於久懸未決之伊寗問題有記者亦曾向張氏詢及，張氏謂：去年八月，阿合買提江曾來一信，提出四點，本年二月中旬，曾有一信復阿合賣提江者提出五點，雙方均以事實為簽覆，只要事實做到，雙方自可逐漸靠攏，水到渠成。記者詢以新疆省政府改組，對伊寗問題有何影響？張氏謂只有好影響。」</p>
<p>中蘇新疆商約　雙方正商談中</p>
<p>談及中蘇有關新疆之通商及經濟合作條約時，張氏稱：現正由外交部新疆特派員劉澤榮率領之代表團，與蘇方商談中，將來尙須經中央政府批准，並將正式公佈，決無任何秘密之可言，並無特別意義。張氏特別聲明條約中並無領土主權的關係在內，亦無「專利權」之字樣。記者詢以蘇聯曾要求在新疆之開鑛權，確否？張氏稱：所要求者爲經濟合作，其性質都是很普通的，外報曾有若干推測之詞，實因不明商談內容及新疆的歷史事實所致，此非現在之問題，而是盛世才時代就有的，後來宋子文任行政院長時代，曾向蘇聯提出修正，現在蘇聯有一個建議，給我們作爲答覆，因而進行談判，談判進行還沒完成，將來目當將內容完全發表。</p>
<p>甚願南北奔走　謀洋重申間協調</p>
<p>最後，有一記者以近來京穗間對政院南遷似有不協調現象之看法爲問，張氏避免作答，惟稱：孫院長曾邀其赴穗，渠亦擬赴廣州一行，惟聞孫院長近有來京說，如孫院長來，當然卽可不再去穗。張氏表洋如果有必要，渠甚願意為京穗間之協調奔走。臨散會前，有一記者復詢以外傳孫院長辭職，李代總統卽擬請張氏組閣之說確否？張氏亦不作正面答覆而表示否認。歷一小時之答問，至此遂於笑聲中結束，張氏乃與各記者一一握手道別。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕張治中將軍抵京後，廿三日上午曾往訪顧祝同，午間再訪何應欽。又，今晨十時許，桂永淸曾往張氏窩邸訪晤，適張已外出，未獲晤見。</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州廿二日電〕據悉：張治中此次飛京，除出席卽將在京召開之重要會議外，將飛穗一行，渠之另一任務卽與中福商討有關西北軍政應變方案，俾獲得中櫃之同意與支持。西北軍政副畏官馬鴻賓，迪化市長屈武，廿二晶亦與張氏同機飛京</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州廿三日電〕青省財慶長台威榜等一行三人，廿三日抵蘭，商討西北經濟應變方案有關問題。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>當前的教授待遇問題</h3>
<p>草木萌動，萬卉迎春，天地大化並沒有因爲人間的苦難而乖悖了時序。正像我們的各級學校，並沒有因爲國內的戰亂影響，都已次第開學上課。這確是在這國事不和不戰的拖延期間一件令人稍可安慰的事。</p>
<p>宋代朱光庭就學於程明遠，過後對人家說：聽程夫子講學，如坐春風之中。孟子所謂「所以敎者五」，第一就「有如時雨之化者」。因此，春風化雨也就成了敎育效能的象徵。當前全國正一致蘄求和平，化暴戾爲祥和，在這春風駘蕩，春雨如霧如烟之中，各校學子依然能够弦歌不輟，享受到春風化雨的學校敎育，蘊育着下一代的光明。我們自然要爲靑年學子慶，更將爲國家民族前途慶。</p>
<p>可是事實的本身並不盡然樂觀，光明的側面就是陰影，春風中還不免帶着料峭的春寒，化雨夏也許還夾着冰雹。中小學敎育暫且不談，只就當前的高等敎育來看，無論學校設備，課業水準，不能與戰前相比；就是敎育環境與敎學情緒，也是每况愈下。尤其這半年來，先是瀋陽長春等校輾轉入關，嗣則華北豫魯各校播遷江南，事先中央敎育當局均無局密計劃，事後又無妥善安排。這些學校沒有一所不弄得支離破碎，無法上課；敎員學生也都顚沛流離，叫苦速天。</p>
<p>至於敎育經費原來完全遵照憲法規定，所佔國庫預算本屬有限，支配標準亦不合理，再受幣値貶落，物價騰漲的影響，自然更形拮据。政院南遷之後，旣未能按時發放，合理調整，而敎育主管長官，又是上門不見土地，使一般專科以上學校幾乎成了三不管。即以本月中旬本市國立專科以上學校敎授聯誼會代表晉京請發應變儲糧經費一事而言，僅勉獲一億元，由各校分配，杯水車薪，不言可喻。</p>
<p>再說一般大專以上的敎員薪給，本比照各級公務人員同等待造。據本月二十日本市國立院校敎授發表吿社會人士書中所言：「就跟前所得而論，以之買米，不足兩斗，用之買菜，每日還不够蔬菜斤半，終年所得不足以付眼前一月水電煤氣之需；連配米三斗，亦不易　一人之口。至於所謂學術研究補助費，敎授每月五十元，副敎授四十允，不够買一張當天的報紙。」像這種生活之下，還談得到什麽敎學情緒？又怎樣叫他們去爲國儲才？</p>
<p>雖說我國讀書人的積習是「君子固窮」，「正其誼不謀其利」，然而經過八年抗戰，三年內爭之餘，處於妻孥交　，啼飢號寒的家庭環攻之間，也逼得大學敎授們不得不斤於待遇之厚薄，慨嘆乎生活之逼人。意志薄弱者早已改行轉業，其不改行轉業者，也往往兼職兼薪，以謀挹注。不然亦必賴拍賣衣物藏書，或吿貨借債，維持其家庭開支。於此，我們還能有什麽理由可以責求春風化雨於今日的學府講堂之上，更有什麽希望於今日的學子來做未來社會的棟樑呢！</p>
<p>縱不談建國時期敎育第一，要之敎育乃立隨之本，爲政之要。大學敎員待遇問題，本市院校敎授連旺仍在商討進行，呼籲改善的消息每日報紙幾乎都有記載。此外如大專敎育水準的低落，學校設備的簡陋，更觸目皆是，不一而足。我們不知道陳代部畏看到了沒有？我們更擔心這種情况或將繼續不斷的發展與擴大，恐怕等不到共軍砲火的威脅，我們的大學敎育早已名存實亡，徒然剩了幾塊大專院校的空招脾了！</p>
<p>不能提高敎授待遇，充實學校設備，則無法安定敎學生活，振奮敎學情緒；不能安定敎學生活，振奮敎學情緒，則不但是整個高等敎育的失敗，也是國家最大的損失，民族永久的危機。今日當局如能勇於負責，及時補救，也還來得及。倘一味泄沓敷衍，頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，那就不啻甘願做國家民族的罪人了。</p>
<p>更有望於我全國敎授者，　食瓢飲，乃見我國學人卓絕之處。在此待遇行將調整之際，惟希一本學術尊嚴，敎不厭，誨不倦的精神，顧念莘莘學子向學之心，及無數家畏與社會之屬望；發揮我先聖先賢的大仁犬智大勇，竭人性之至誠，參天地之大化，鎮定以應變，堅忍而敎學，振奮硏究情緒，提高學術空氣，俾使瀰漫全國之風暴，都化作一片祥和的春光！</p>

<h3>籃球盟主六次出馬　華聯今晚戰恩卡斯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市籃球盟主華聯隊，在本國聯賽中橫掃羣雄，五戰五勝，繼續掌握錦標，當無問題。華聯在第一循環中，尙餘對恩卡斯及滬警兩戰，三月一日起開始第二循環。華聯造成淸一色之戰續，確有此把握。聯賽開賽迄今，已逾匝月，至二十七日，甲一組及女子組第一循環宣吿完畢，僅甲組有三塲展期，尙待補賽。華聯今晚與恩卡斯相逢，寃家對頭，過去每次遭逢，必有血戰，西靑番將，脆計多端，今晚威脅盟主之野心，自在意料之中。門券分六百三百一百五十元三種，市體育館下午四時起開始發售。比賽五時半起，共計三塲，秩序如下：</p>

<p>滬警對海靑，滬警卽晨友盃冠軍放友隊化身，太屆參加聯賽，四勝一負，目下形勢，僅次於華聯，今晚如能擊退番兵，則首循末塲對華聯一役，將益見重要。海青係由靑島來滬之美艦海軍出戰，前日已向　委會報到，與前番人馬大有調動，惟悉實力依然强勁，且來者不善，善者不來，滬警諸將應有所愼防。</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Holds Meeting in Guangzhou, Passes Financial Reform Plan, Readjusts Salaries for Government Employees and Teachers Again Starting in March, Wuzhou Designated as Foreign Trade Port</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] A new economic reform plan was passed yesterday during the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting held in Guangzhou. The details have not yet been announced, but it is widely rumored in financial circles in this city that in the future, one silver dollar will be equivalent to 1,200 gold yuan, one tael of gold will be worth 100 silver dollars, and one US dollar will be equivalent to two silver dollars. This rumor has not been confirmed, but relevant parties indicate that it has some basis. Furthermore, Liu Gongyun, President of the Central Bank, has completed his official business in Guangzhou and will be heading to Hong Kong in the coming days to negotiate with influential parties, as the implementation of the new plan relies on the cooperation of all parties.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou Dispatch, 23rd] The Executive Yuan continued to hold its 45th meeting in Guangzhou on the 23rd, both in the morning and afternoon. Premier Sun chaired the meeting, with Vice Premier Wu and heads of various ministries and commissions in attendance. The following important proposals were passed:</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion: (1) In order to alleviate current financial and economic difficulties and improve people's livelihoods, the Ministry of Finance, led by Minister Xu, and Chief Accountant Pang, in consultation with relevant agencies, drafted a financial and economic reform plan. It was resolved to be amended and passed, and submitted to the President to invoke temporary provisions, first announcing its implementation, and then amending relevant laws to supplement the legislative process. (2) To strengthen the organization and rectify discipline, the first step should be to adjust the structure and unify authority, so as to improve efficiency and simplify procedures. It was resolved in principle to first start with the Executive Yuan, making reasonable adjustments and mergers, and after the Premier and Vice Premier make a decision, it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval and implementation. (3) Although the salaries of government employees and teachers were generally adjusted in February, due to rising prices, they are still insufficient. On the 23rd, it was resolved to adjust salaries in March, and the Ministries of Finance and Budgeting were instructed to promptly draft and submit a proposal for approval. As for the food allowance for employees of central agencies that have relocated, the amount for March will remain the same as in February, and will be distributed separately. In addition, regarding the original system of providing rations in kind, how to raise and distribute them after the government's relocation to Guangzhou was also decided to be discussed by the relevant competent authorities, and a proposal will be promptly drafted and submitted for approval. (4) The Ministry of Finance proposed: Wuzhou was originally a trading port before the war, and Chinese and foreign ships could load goods from that port for export, or foreign ships could carry goods to that port for import. However, after the war, the government stipulated overseas commercial trade ports, and this port was not included. As a result, direct commercial trade between Wuzhou and Hong Kong and Macau ceased. Wuzhou merchants exporting local products must go through the Guangzhou Customs for export, and imported foreign goods must also go through the Guangzhou Customs for import before being transported to Wuzhou. The merchants of Guangxi Province, in view of the decline of trade in the port, have repeatedly requested the Provincial Council and the Provincial Government to forward a request to open the port. Considering the current situation, it is no longer comparable to the past. In order to meet current needs, promote export trade, and earn foreign exchange, it is proposed to designate Wuzhou as an open port for foreign trade, so that Guangxi local products can be directly exported from Wuzhou, and foreign goods from Hong Kong and Macau can be directly imported from Wuzhou, which will be of great benefit to the national economy. The resolution was passed.</p>

<h3>Yan Huiqing and Shao Lizi</h3>
<p>Rumored to Go to Shijiazhuang for "Sightseeing"</p>
<p>Wu Yu-hou and Others Leave Hong Kong Today to Return to Guangzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] San Francisco, 23rd (Broadcast): The Shaanxi Northern Communist Radio Station broadcast a message from Peiping stating that Lin Biao, Luo Ronghuan, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Jianying, Dong Biwu, Bo Yibo, and other Communist Party leaders in Peiping invited 386 democratic figures, including Zhang Xiruo, to a banquet at the Beijing Hotel at 3:00 PM on the 20th. Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, Zhang Shizhao, Jiang Yong, and others who came to Peiping for discussions in their personal capacity also attended the invitation. A film about democratic Northeast China was shown after the banquet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 23rd] It is learned that Yan Huiqing and Shao Lizi went to Shijiazhuang for "sightseeing" yesterday, accompanied by several officials from the North China People's Government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 23rd] According to sources from North China, the reports from foreign news agencies recently, stating that Mao Zedong had met with Shao Lizi, are denied. It is also claimed that if such a meeting were to be held, its purpose would only be to provide Mao Zedong with some advice.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] A high-ranking official confirmed the news reports that the initial contact between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in Peiping had made significant progress. However, on the other hand, although Acting President Li personally went to Guangzhou to try to bridge the gap between Nanjing and Guangzhou, the progress is not enough to support an optimistic outlook for peace talks. It is also reliably reported that Shao Lizi telegraphed Li Zongren, reporting the details of his talks with the Communist Party authorities in Peiping. Although the exact content was not revealed, it is said that the report used an optimistic tone, stating that efforts to narrow the distance between the two sides have made progress.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 23rd] Professor Wu Yuhou announced that he would return to Guangzhou on the morning of the 24th and would no longer contact the Communist Party and liberal factions in Hong Kong, as they refused to meet with him. When he and his two companions met with reporters, they claimed that Li Zongren and Sun Ke approved of their peace movement, but did not mention what organization they represented. Hong Kong newspapers indicated that they were mentors of the Kuomintang Youth League, and his two companions were considered to be former police officers.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Holds Discussion Meeting Yesterday, Suggests Holding a Resumption Ceremony Within the Month, The Issue of "Focused Discussion" Will Be Studied Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Legislative members who arrived in Nanjing held a discussion meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to exchange views on various issues. More than 20 legislative members attended, with Yang Youjiong presiding. Huang Zhengzhi, Xu Pan-yun, Cheng Yuanzhen, and others who came to Nanjing from Shanghai and Hangzhou reported on the opinions of the legislative members in Shanghai and Hangzhou. Mr. Dong stated that about 30 legislative members in Hangzhou may come to Nanjing on the 24th. Mr. Huang believes that during this extraordinary period, the meetings of the Legislative Yuan should change from the usual format and implement focused discussions, first focusing on (1) the peace issue, (2) whether it is necessary to move the meeting location, (3) the policy guidelines of the new Executive Yuan, and (4) the urgent need for reform issues, such as commodity prices and the salaries of government employees and teachers. Xu Pan-yun agreed with Mr. Dong's proposal, but said that the current focus should be on (1) the peace issue, (2) the issue of reforming the currency system, and (3) the issue of rectifying official corruption and military discipline. He also hoped that the Secretariat would prepare materials for discussion. During the meeting, it was agreed that a separate discussion meeting should be held to study the issue of focused discussion. As for the date of resumption, it was unanimously agreed to make a suggestion to President Tong Guangsheng, hoping that a resumption ceremony would be held within the month, and then the meeting would be scheduled to be held at a later date.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The third session of the Legislative Yuan will resume in Nanjing within this month, which is almost certain. Legislative members who have arrived in Nanjing believe that according to the Constitution, the Legislative Yuan should meet in February, and the Legislative Yuan should not violate the Constitution. On the 23rd, it was decided to suggest to President Tong Guanxian that a date be decided within the month to hold a resumption ceremony, and the official opening of the meeting could be postponed for a few days to promote unity. As for the different opinions of the legislative members in Guangzhou, there is nothing too serious. President Tong telephoned Guangzhou long distance on the 22nd and learned that the legislative members in Guangzhou were not completely opposed to holding the meeting in Nanjing. They argued that there was no need to rush to hold the meeting, and it would be best to postpone it for a few days to wait for them to obtain transportation to go north. Legislative members continued to register on the 23rd. Those who registered on the 23rd included Wang Youxi, Xu Fanyun, Luo Xiatian, Cheng Yuanzhen, Lu Guanting, Bai Jianmin, Ma Shucheng, Huang Zhengzhi, and others, mostly from Shanghai and Hangzhou. Before today, there were a total of 56 people. According to what was learned on the 23rd, the legislative members in Wuhan and Guilin have agreed on an aircraft and can arrive in Nanjing on the 24th or 25th. Legislative members in Shanghai and Hangzhou will arrive gradually from the 24th, and it is expected that they will arrive in Nanjing before the end of the month. Legislative members can reach the legal quorum of more than one-fifth, or 156 people.</p>
<h3>Legislative Members Staying in Guangzhou Request Postponement of Resumption, Tong Guanxian Replies by Telegram Explaining</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Liaison Association of Legislative Members Staying in Guangzhou sent a telegram to Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, on the 22nd, expressing dissenting views on the resumption of the Yuan in Nanjing. He replied with a special telegram on the 23rd, explaining the reasons, stating that: "I have just read the open telegram from the Liaison Association of Legislative Members Staying in Guangzhou in the Central News Agency news, and it is earnest and sincere, stating that the recent notice to resume the meeting in Nanjing was made in strict accordance with the opinions of the majority of colleagues and based on the current security situation in Nanjing and the provisions of the Constitution. As for the time of resumption, according to the current transportation situation, colleagues are scattered in various places, and the date of the notice can no longer be postponed. I plan to wait until the legal resumption is held as scheduled, and then discuss with the attending colleagues to postpone the discussion of major issues for a few days, waiting for colleagues from afar to arrive in Nanjing to discuss together."</p>
<h3>Legislative Members Zou Zhifen and Others Exchange Views on Resumption</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Zou Zhifen, Chen Zifeng, Wu Yunpeng, Lin Dong, Pan Chaoying, He Zuozhi, and six other legislative members dispatched by the legislative members staying in Guangzhou arrived in Shanghai by plane from Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 23rd, and immediately exchanged views with the legislative members staying in Shanghai on the issue of the meeting location. At the same time, they telegraphed President Tong Guanxian, who was busy preparing for the resumption in Nanjing, requesting that he respect the opinions of the legislative members staying in Guangzhou and conduct a vote to decide on the location of the meeting. Furthermore, they were extremely busy after arriving in Shanghai, and will continue to discuss the issue of the resumption of the Legislative Yuan with the legislative members staying in Shanghai at the New Life Club at 3:00 PM on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Communist Party "Establishes Capital" in Peiping, with Dong Biwu as the Head of Administration</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to Peiping Communist Radio, the Communist Party's "North China People's Government" formally moved into Peiping on the 20th of this month, and the office should be temporarily located at the old site of the Peiping Bankers' Association on Xipishi Street.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 23rd] The Communist Party has formally established a government and made Peiping its capital. The Communist Party is taking various steps to make this ancient capital of the Qing Dynasty, a cultural and political center, the administrative center of North China under the control of the Communist Party. The formal announcement was issued on the 23rd that the "government" had moved from Shijiazhuang to Peiping. But according to the announcement issued by the Chinese Communist Party, this move to the capital began on February 20. The announcement is accompanied by several detailed rules, mainly signed by Dong Biwu, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who will be the head of the administrative region here.</p>
<p>As for whether this move of the capital by the Communist Party will affect the time and other arrangements for the Shanghai Peace Delegation to hold peace talks with the leaders of the Communist Party, it is not yet known immediately. The administrative departments that have been established here to date include the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Education, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, Public Enterprises, Transportation, Public Health, Public Security, and Justice. (According to United Press, there are nine departments, namely Civil Affairs, Education, Finance, Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, Transportation, Health, Justice, and Labor. In addition, there are the North China Finance and Economy Company, the North China Water Conservancy Bureau, the North China People's Court, and the North China People's Bank.) So far, the Communist Party government has formally moved from Shijiazhuang, where it was established on September 20 last year, to Peiping. Apart from Dong Biwu being the head of the administrative authorities, other senior leaders of the Communist Party were not mentioned, at least not for the time being. As for what position and whereabouts Mao Zedong will hold, it was not clearly indicated. At the same time, there is no doubt that Mao will continue to fully guide the policies of the Communist Party. The announcement also did not mention whether this move will affect the scheduled plan for the Shanghai Peace Delegation to go to Shijiazhuang for a meeting with Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>The local newspapers often publish in a limited capacity that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party may seek a common ground to lead to a basis for peace talks. On the 23rd, the newspapers published very little information on this matter. Today, the newspapers focused on the "new government's" plans for "foreign" trade. Shao Lizi, Yan Huiqing, and other members of the Shanghai delegation have flown to Shijiazhuang to meet with Mao, or the Communist Party's decision to move the capital has delayed the original plan from being announced.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the Communist Party will soon announce a plan that foreign and Chinese merchants will be allowed to come to Peiping to engage in commerce between North China and other parts of China and foreign countries.</p>
<p>[Local News] According to news from Peiping on the 23rd, the Peiping Military Control Commission took over the Palace Museum on the 19th.</p>

(2) Reform the currency system, rectify tax revenues, and improve the financial situation. (3) Reorganize the army and improve the treatment of soldiers. (4) Cut unnecessary agencies and reduce expenditures, which will be submitted for discussion at the upcoming political affairs meeting.</p>

<p>A: I have not received the correct information.</p>

<p>A: According to Mao Zedong's broadcast, military action will not stop until peace is achieved. From this point of view, we cannot say that they have no intention of invading the south.

<h3>Reception of Reporters and Responses to Inquiries: A Spirited and Pleasant Conversation</h3>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Discusses the Future of Peace: Everyone Wants Peace, Success is Certain. Whether or Not to Go to Beiping is Still Undecided</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] General Zhang Zhizhong, the government's peace talk representative, received reporters from various newspapers at his private residence in Shenjuren Lane at 5:00 PM on the 23rd, answering various inquiries. More than thirty reporters attended, filling Zhang's reception room to capacity. It was the first time in over a month that so many reporters had gathered in one place since the political atmosphere in the capital became quiet. Zhang entered the reception room at 5:00 PM sharp, dressed in a traditional long gown and mandarin jacket, looking very elegant. He answered reporters' questions, conversing with spirit and often laughing heartily, creating a lively and pleasant atmosphere. The Q&amp;A session lasted an hour. He addressed issues of great concern to the general public: (1) the peace talks, (2) the Northwest issue, and (3) the Sino-Soviet treaty regarding trade and economic cooperation in Xinjiang. Finally, he also discussed the issue of the Executive Yuan's relocation to the South.</p>
<p>Answering questions about the peace talks, Zhang maintained his consistent optimistic view. He said: "I have always been optimistic, and I am optimistic about everything." A reporter asked for the reason for his optimism. Zhang laughed and said: "Optimism is optimism, and the reason doesn't need to be deeply understood." He then explained: "It is very clear that now it is not just us who want peace, but the people want peace, and the whole world wants peace. Doesn't the Communist Party want peace? Everyone wants peace, and peace will eventually be successful. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have fought for twenty years, so of course the peace talks will have twists and turns, but in the end, I am still optimistic." A reporter asked why he had resigned as a peace talk representative and whether the reason for his resignation was because he was pessimistic about the peace talks. Zhang quickly replied: "No! Because one person cannot carry two burdens. When I was in the Northwest, everyone did not want me to leave the Northwest and did not approve of me being a peace talk representative, because if I became a peace talk representative, I could not take care of the affairs of the Northwest." Zhang explained his resignation as a representative by saying: "But if the central government insists that I do it, I have no choice. I hope the central government will not ask me to do it." Answering the question of whether he would go to Beiping recently, Zhang said: "It's still too early to say. Perhaps it can only be decided after Mr. Shao returns. Before Mr. Shao went to Beiping, he sent a telegram from Shanghai to Lanzhou, saying that he had decided to go to Beiping, 'regardless of gains or losses', hoping that I could come to Beijing; there has been no news since he arrived in Beiping." A reporter further asked: "If Acting President Li asks Mr. Zhang to go to Beiping now, would you be willing to go?" Zhang still said: "It is still too early to say. If that happens, I will give you a hypothetical answer." Regarding the criticism he received in the two broadcasts by the Chinese Communist Party, Zhang said that he would remain "silent". When a reporter asked for his views on the CCP's eight peace conditions, Zhang said he did not want to express an opinion. When a reporter asked for his opinion on the issue of war criminals, Zhang smiled and asked the reporter: "Are you a war criminal?" Then he laughed.</p>
<h3>Northwestern Economic Plan Submitted to the Central Government for Approval</h3>
<p>Regarding the Northwest issue, Zhang first stated in his answer that the Northwest Military and Political Conference was only a platform for everyone to exchange views on the overall situation and the Northwest issue. The rumors that there were any resolutions and that someone advocated for war, and others opposed the peace talks, are completely untrue. Their opinions are very good and fully respect the central government's peaceful decision. Regarding the economic problems in the Northwest, the Northwest has drafted an emergency economic plan for the Northwest, which has been brought to the central government for approval. The plan included a proposal for each province in the Northwest to mint its own silver coins in order to stabilize the currency value in the Northwest and to seek self-reliance in the Northwest's economy. However, if the central government does not approve it, it will naturally not be implemented. This is not the Northwest's first attempt. In fact, many provinces are already doing it. Currently, commercial transactions in the Northwest provinces are already calculated in hard currency. The gold yuan has depreciated, and the people no longer trust it. The production of hard currency is indeed necessary.</p>
<p>Regarding the long-unresolved Yining issue, a reporter also asked Zhang. Zhang said: "Last August, Ahematijan sent a letter with four points. In mid-February of this year, a letter was sent in response to Ahematijan, proposing five points. Both sides responded with facts. As long as the facts are achieved, the two sides will gradually move closer, and success will come naturally." A reporter asked what impact the reorganization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government would have on the Yining issue. Zhang said that it would only have a "good impact."</p>
<h3>Sino-Soviet Xinjiang Commercial Treaty is Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>Speaking of the Sino-Soviet treaty on trade and economic cooperation in Xinjiang, Zhang said: "The delegation led by Liu Zerong, the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Xinjiang, is currently negotiating with the Soviet side. In the future, it must be approved by the central government and will be officially announced. There is absolutely no secret. " He also said that the treaty has no effect on territorial sovereignty, or the mention of "patent rights." A reporter asked whether the Soviet Union had requested mining rights in Xinjiang. Zhang replied that the request was for economic cooperation, the nature of which was very ordinary. Some speculative remarks in the foreign press were due to a lack of understanding of the content of the negotiations and the historical facts of Xinjiang. This is not a current issue, but something that existed during the Sheng Shicai era. Later, when Song Ziwen was the President of the Executive Yuan, he proposed revisions to the Soviet Union. Now the Soviet Union has a suggestion to give us as a response, so negotiations are underway. The negotiations are not yet complete, and the content will be fully released in the future.</p>
<h3>Very Willing to Travel Between North and South to Seek Coordination Between Nanjing and Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Finally, a reporter asked about the lack of coordination between Nanjing and Guangzhou regarding the relocation of the Executive Yuan to the South. Zhang avoided answering, but said: "President Sun invited him to Guangzhou, and he also planned to go to Guangzhou. However, he heard that President Sun would come to Nanjing soon. If President Sun comes, he will naturally no longer need to go to Guangzhou." Zhang said that if necessary, he was very willing to travel between Nanjing and Guangzhou to coordinate. Before the end of the meeting, a reporter asked again whether the rumors that President Sun had resigned and that Acting President Li was planning to invite Zhang to form a cabinet were true. Zhang also did not give a direct answer but denied it. The hour-long Q&amp;A session ended with laughter, and Zhang shook hands with each reporter to say goodbye.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] After General Zhang Zhizhong arrived in Nanjing, he visited Gu Zhutong on the morning of the 23rd and then visited He Yingqin at noon. Also, Gui Yongqing visited Zhang's residence this morning around 10:00 AM, but Zhang had already gone out and was unable to meet him.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Lanzhou, 22nd] It is reported that in addition to attending the important meetings that will be held in Nanjing, Zhang Zhizhong will also fly to Guangzhou to discuss with the central government the emergency plan for the Northwest military and political affairs, so as to obtain the central government's agreement and support. Ma Hongbin, the deputy commander of the Northwest Military and Political Affairs, and Qu Wu, the mayor of Dihua, also flew to Beijing on the same plane as Zhang on the 22nd.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Lanzhou, 23rd] Qinghai Province Finance Director Tai Weibang and his party of three arrived in Lanzhou on the 23rd to discuss issues related to the Northwest Economic Contingency Plan.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Current Problem of Professors' Salaries</h3>
<p>The grass and trees sprout, and all the flowers welcome the spring. The great transformations of nature have not been thwarted by human suffering. Just like our schools at all levels, which have all started classes in sequence without being affected by the domestic war. This is indeed something that can be slightly comforting during this period of drawn-out national unrest.</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, Zhu Guangting studied under Cheng Mingyuan. Afterwards, he told people: Listening to Master Cheng's lectures is like sitting in the spring breeze. Mencius said that "there are five ways to teach," the first being "to transform like timely rain." Therefore, the "spring breeze and timely rain" has become a symbol of educational effectiveness. Currently, the whole country is unanimously seeking peace, transforming violence into auspiciousness. In this gentle spring breeze and misty spring rain, students in various schools can still continue to study and enjoy school education that nurtures the next generation. We should naturally celebrate for the young students, and even more so for the future of the country and the nation.</p>
<p>However, the facts themselves are not entirely optimistic. The bright side has its shadows. The spring breeze inevitably carries a bit of the biting spring cold, and the summer rain may even be mixed with hail. Without discussing primary and secondary education for the time being, just looking at the current higher education, neither the school equipment nor the academic standards can compare with those before the war. The educational environment and teaching morale are also deteriorating. Especially in the past six months, first, schools in Shenyang and Changchun and other cities entered the customs in a roundabout way, and then schools in North China, Henan, and Shandong moved to the south of the Yangtze River. The central education authorities had no secret plans beforehand, and no proper arrangements afterwards. None of these schools have managed to avoid being fragmented and unable to hold classes. Teachers and students have also been displaced and complained bitterly.</p>
<p>As for education funding, it was originally allocated according to the Constitution, accounting for a limited portion of the national treasury budget. The allocation standards were also unreasonable. Affected by the depreciation of the currency and rising prices, it became even more strained. After the Executive Yuan moved south, it failed to issue funds on time and make reasonable adjustments. The chief education officer was nowhere to be found, making most vocational schools and above virtually ownerless. Take the recent visit to Beijing by representatives of the Nanjing National Vocational Schools and Above Professors' Association in the middle of this month to request emergency food relief funds. Only 100 million yuan was barely obtained, which was distributed among the schools. It is easy to imagine that it was a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the salaries of teachers in general colleges and universities are based on the same standards as civil servants at all levels. According to a letter to the public issued by professors of national colleges and universities in this city on the 20th of this month: "In terms of the current income, it is not enough to buy two dou of rice. If used to buy vegetables, it is not enough for half a catty of vegetables per day. The annual income is not enough to pay for the water, electricity, and gas bills for one month. Even with the allocation of three dou of rice, it is not enough for one person's mouth. As for the so-called academic research subsidy, professors receive 50 yuan per month, and associate professors receive 40 yuan, which is not enough to buy a newspaper for the day." Under such a life, how can we talk about teaching morale? And how can we ask them to cultivate talents for the country?</p>
<p>Although the ingrained habit of Chinese intellectuals is "a gentleman remains steadfast in poverty" and "upholds righteousness and does not seek profit," after eight years of resistance against Japan and three years of civil war, in the midst of a family with wives and children crying for hunger and cold, university professors are also forced to haggle over the thickness of their salaries and lament the oppression of life. Those with weak wills have long since changed careers. Those who do not change careers often take on multiple jobs and salaries to supplement their income. Otherwise, they must rely on selling clothes and books, or borrowing and taking out loans, to maintain their family expenses. In this case, what reason do we have to demand the "spring breeze and timely rain" in today's universities and lecture halls, and what hope can we have for today's students to become the pillars of future society?</p>
<p>Even without talking about "education first" during the nation-building period, education is the foundation of the country and the key to governance. The problem of university teachers' salaries, and the news that professors in universities and colleges in this city are still discussing and appealing for improvements, is recorded almost every day in the newspaper. In addition, the decline in the academic standards of higher education and the dilapidated school equipment are all eye-catching and endless. We don't know if Minister Chen has seen it? We are even more worried that this situation may continue to develop and expand. I am afraid that before the threat of the Communist army's artillery fire, our university education will have already become nominal and merely have empty signboards!</p>
<p>Without raising professors' salaries and improving school equipment, it will not be possible to stabilize teaching life and boost teaching morale. Without stabilizing teaching life and boosting teaching morale, it will not only be the failure of the entire higher education, but also the greatest loss to the country and the permanent crisis of the nation. If the authorities today can bravely take responsibility and remedy the situation in time, it is still not too late. If they simply prevaricate and treat the symptoms rather than the root cause, then it would be tantamount to being willing to be a sinner to the country and the nation.</p>
<p>We have even more hope for professors across the country that eating simple meals and drinking from a gourd exemplifies the extraordinary qualities of Chinese scholars. At this time when salaries are about to be adjusted, we only hope that they will uphold the dignity of scholarship, the spirit of teaching without fatigue and tireless instruction, taking into consideration the students' desire to learn, and the expectations of countless families and society; display the great benevolence, wisdom, and courage of our ancient sages and sages, exert the utmost sincerity of human nature, participate in the great transformations of heaven and earth, respond to changes with composure, and teach with perseverance, boost research morale, and improve the academic atmosphere, so that the storm that pervades the country can be transformed into a peaceful spring!</p>

<h3>John Leighton Stuart Speaks in San Francisco: America Should Pay Attention to the Situation in China</h3>
<h3>Father Mao Denounces "Wait-and-See Policy" in the Far East</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 22nd] John Leighton Stuart, Director of the China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration, returned to the country to report on his work. He said here on the 22nd: The Chinese will not become thorough Communists. The Chinese are hard-working and do not want to be restricted by other countries. Personally, the Chinese will never become Communists. At this time, so-called communism refers to a minority controlling the masses, like Moscow. But Americans should pay more attention to the situation in China. China is undergoing a great revolution, moving from feudalism to democracy. It is still a long way for China to catch up with the modern world.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Father Mao, a Chinese Catholic priest who recently arrived here from Nanjing, said on the 22nd: America's "wait-and-see policy" in the Far East is tantamount to a policy of "sitting idly by and waiting for China to die." He denounced the view, which is commonly held by Americans, that Mao Zedong may be China's Tito and lead the CCP to break away from Moscow's control, as a kind of "illusion." He also denounced the general concept, satirized as "the Chinese will be able to assimilate the Communist Party in the same way that they assimilated other invaders in the past," as a preposterous myth. Mao said: The Chinese people are now afraid that the United States will gradually recognize the government controlled by the Communist Party. He said: Policy statements from the United States could dispel this concern. He said: As of now, there are still fourteen provinces in China that are not under the control of the Communist Party.</p>

<h3>Lanzhou Silver Dollars Decide to Openly Trade</h3>

<p>[This Newspaper, Lanzhou, 23rd] Following the eastward flow of silver dollars, gold yuan coupons are also being transported to other places for profit. A few days ago, someone carried two large boxes of gold yuan coupons to Shaanxi. Although it was discovered at the time, there was no legal basis to stop it, so they had to let it go. According to those familiar with this matter: Because of the lack of chips in Xi'an, the discount has reached 200 yuan, and the Shaanxi exchange rate has also reached 150 yuan. If 10 million yuan in cash is transported to Shaanxi, a profit of 3.5 million yuan can be made. This is disrupting the financial market, and the consequences are unimaginable. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to cracking down on this.</p>

<h3>Today's Four Powers Conference on Austrian Treaty: Listening to the South's Vice Foreign Minister's Arguments; South's Political Attitude Expected to Be Revealed</h3>
<p>[French News Agency London 22nd Dispatch] At today's meeting of the four foreign ministers' representatives to discuss the Austrian treaty, disagreements arose again regarding Austria's assets in the south. Yugoslavia demands (1) reparations of 150 million yuan, (2) taking over Austrian assets worth 120 million yuan. The French representative believes that this demand is too high, so he requested that the South should be content with 120 million yuan and abandon the demand for reparations. The British and American representatives both supported the French proposal. The Soviet representative 魯平 again supported the South's demand. At the same time, Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber arrived here from Vienna tonight.

The newspaper predicted that Bebler will announce that the South government is prepared to abandon its demand for Austria to cede all territory in the Galician province. The South may only demand the cession of southern Galicia, where the inhabitants are all Slovenians, to make the area an independent province with a high degree of autonomy. Bebler may also demand that some slight modifications be made to several border areas between South Austria.</p>

<h3>US Watches Situation in Northern Europe: Soviet Union May Send Troops into Finnish Territory; Suspects of Soviet Espionage Arrested in Stockholm</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington 22nd Dispatch] With the tension in the Scandinavian Peninsula, US officials are closely watching the Soviet Union's relationship with Finland because any signs of Soviet action could upset the delicate balance on the flanks of the Cold War front. Some people eagerly hope that the Soviet Union will allow Finland to be natural in the current Scandinavian crisis, but no one dares to expect it to be certain.</p>
<p>The division of the peninsula is expected to be completed within the week, at which time Norway will formally announce its participation in the Atlantic Pact negotiations. Next, it will be Denmark's turn to decide its path. Denmark may lean towards the West, but with more reluctance than Norway. Finally, Sweden is in a semi-neutral isolated position west of the Cold War front. If the Soviet Union does not act, Finland may maintain a similar position to Sweden on the eastern side of the Cold War front. The Swedish Foreign Minister has repeatedly told the United States that once Sweden joins the Atlantic Treaty, the Soviet Union will immediately invoke the Soviet-Finnish Mutual Assistance Treaty and insist on sending troops into Finnish territory. The Soviet-Finnish treaty stipulates that the two governments should immediately consult each other in the event of aggression. Moscow has recently condemned the Atlantic Pact as an attempt by Western countries to invade the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Smith Denies Engaging in Black Market in Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Dismisses Mrs. Buka's Accusations as Absurd</p>
<p>[French News Agency Moscow 22nd Dispatch] Former US Embassy official in the Soviet Union, Mrs. Buka, has published a book entitled "The Truth About American Diplomats."

<h3>Open Rift Between Italian Communists and the Vatican; Provocation Towards the Holy See</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 22nd] Italian Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti, in an article in the communist publication "New Life Weekly" entitled "God and the Atlantic Pact," attacked Pope Pius XII, stating that the Pope, during a special mass on the 3rd of this month, protested the life sentence of Hungarian Archbishop József Mindszenty, believing that the sins of God's enemies should be eradicated. The Pope then declared his support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. All of this proves that the Pope wants to restore the "Holy Alliance" to deal with those liberated from capitalism and imperialism. The world should pay attention to this kind of imperialist behavior baptized with holy water. The Soviet Union needs peace, and the vast majority of people around the world also need peace. Warmongers feel increasingly without a foothold against this broad will and want to destroy atheism and eliminate those who hate God. According to the past policy of the Italian Communist Party, it avoided conflicts with the Holy See. This open rift is probably due to a policy change.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] French Communist Secretary-General Maurice Thorez declared today at the party's Central Committee that if Soviet troops were to occupy France, the French people would act in the same way as the people of Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia. "Enemies of the people" ask what action should be taken if Soviet troops occupy Paris, thinking that this question would embarrass me. In fact, the Soviet army will never launch an aggression, because, by definition, socialist countries never pursue aggressive policies. But if the French people, against their will, are forced to fight against the Soviet Union, and the Soviet army, to protect the people and socialism, has to pursue the enemy and enter French territory, then the French people will act no differently from the people of Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia.</p>

<h3>Kailan Coal Pier Welcomes with Firecrackers; Successful Navigation Between Nationalist and Communist Areas; "Great Shanghai" Vessel Returns to Shanghai, Carrying 4,800 Tons of Coal; Crew Did Not Disembark During One and a Half Day Stay in Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The "Great Shanghai" vessel, carrying five representatives from the Shanghai shipping industry and over 14,000 bags of flour to the Communist-controlled areas of North China, departed from Shanghai on the 12th of this month, arrived in Qinhuangdao on the 18th, loaded 4,800 tons of Kailan coal for the return voyage, and arrived back at the Kailan Coal pier in Yangshupu at 7 PM last night, completing the first commercial voyage between Nationalist and Communist areas. All 98 crew members, except for representatives Wei Wenhan and six others, including Captain Yu Huifang, who were specially permitted by the Chinese Communist side to disembark and go to Tianjin to discuss navigation matters, were prohibited from going ashore. Therefore, they only stayed in Qinhuangdao for 36 hours. Once the exchange and unloading of flour and coal were completed, they all returned to Shanghai on the original vessel. The vessel arrived at a position two nautical miles outside the Wusongkou at 4 PM yesterday. There, Director Xu Jinhuang of the Garrison Headquarters Water Police Inspection Office, together with Deputy Chief of Staff Zhou Chenglie of the Wusong Fortress Command, led more than 20 inspectors on a naval gunboat to board the vessel for inspection. After the inspection, the vessel sailed directly to the Kailan Coal pier. The Kailan Coal pier had not received goods for several months due to the impact of the war. All the workers, upon hearing that the "Great Shanghai" vessel brought news of navigation, set off firecrackers to welcome this first giant vessel to transport coal from North China to Shanghai this year. According to Acting Captain Huang Zhaofang of the vessel: The Chinese Communist side urgently needs food. Before a formal navigation agreement is reached, they agreed to exchange one ton of coal for three bags of flour. Therefore, after unloading this batch of coal, the vessel will continue to load flour and go to North China for exchange, following the "Tangshan" and "Nanchang" vessels. As for the actual situation in North China under Chinese Communist control, all the personnel on the vessel had no impression because they could not disembark under the supervision of armed soldiers at the pier. They only knew that Kailan Coal was still in operation and that the work efficiency of the dockworkers was the same as before.</p>
<p>Chinese Communist Personnel Boarded the Vessel for Inspection</p>
<p>During the vessel's one-and-a-half-day stay in Qinhuangdao, no warships or other vessels were seen at the pier. The atmosphere appeared particularly silent and tense. After the vessel docked, Chinese Communist political personnel boarded the vessel in batches to inspect each room, take roll calls, distribute newspapers and items, and individually inquire about the crew's views on the Chinese Communist Party. Some crew members complained that the food needed on the vessel was also delivered by Chinese Communist personnel, that their actions were excessively restricted, and requested that the "liberated" North China be introduced to the common people. The group of political personnel hesitated for a while and replied, "We are still in a period of military administration, so there may be many inconveniences. We can only express our apologies."</p>
<p>[Further News] The second vessel to head north, the Tangshan, is estimated to have also arrived in Qinhuangdao, but no telegram has been received.</p>
<h3>Postal Issues Resolved; Navigation Under Discussion</h3>
<p>Wei Wenhan and Others Report by Telegram</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] It is reported that Shanghai shipping industry representatives Wei Wenhan and Jiang Keni, who went north to negotiate navigation matters with the Communist side, recently sent a telegram from Peiping to the Shanghai Shipping Association and others, stating that they are currently staying at the Six Nations Hotel and are negotiating with the responsible authorities of the Communist side. The postal issue has been resolved. On the next northbound vessel, mail will be allowed to be transported with the vessel. They will return south immediately after the navigation issue is resolved.</p>

<h3>Students Displaced from Other Areas Request Relief for Days; Local Authorities Struggling to Cope</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Students displaced from other areas continue to arrive in Shanghai, and local authorities are struggling to cope. In addition to the more than 280 displaced students from Shandong Province temporarily residing at the Shandong Guild Hall, nearly 100 people were recently brought from Qingdao. Their meals are temporarily provided by the Municipal Relief Association, which sends a mobile porridge distribution truck to supply two meals a day. A few days ago, the truck drove to the Zhabei fire site to provide relief to the disaster victims, and the displaced students went without food for a day. The Municipal Relief Association's funding is tight, and it can only maintain the displaced students' meals for a short period of time. For days, they have repeatedly sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Education Bureau to petition, but local authorities have stated that they cannot be responsible for this long-term. The Ministry of Education has moved far away to Guangzhou. At this time when the staff of the Ministry of Education in Shanghai are experiencing financial difficulties and are at a loss, the disposal of displaced students has become a major problem for local authorities.</p>

Yesterday, Judge Qian Songsen of the District Court presided over the trial. The three defendants, poorly dressed and gaunt-faced, all claimed that they had found the money on the ground and were wrongly accused. The court then consulted the report of the victim Wan at the railway police station. The court immediately rose and delivered the verdict: the three defendants, acting in collusion, committed theft at the station: each sentenced to three months imprisonment.

<h3>Basketball Champion Six Times, Hualian, to Battle Encars Tonight</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Hualian team, the basketball champion of this city, has swept all opponents in the national league, winning all five games and continuing to hold the championship title, which is not in question. In the first round, Hualian has two remaining games against Encars and Shanghai Police. The second round will begin on March 1st. Hualian has created an all-Chinese lineup and is confident of this. The league has been in progress for over a month. The first round for Group A1 and the women's group ended on the 27th. Only three games in Group A have been postponed and need to be rescheduled. Hualian will face Encars tonight. They are old rivals, and every encounter is sure to be a bloody battle. The Western players of Qing have many tricks, and their ambition to threaten the champion tonight is to be expected. Tickets are available in three denominations: 600, 300, and 150 yuan. Sales will begin at the City Gymnasium at 4:00 PM. The competition will start at 5:30 PM, with a total of three games. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Hezhong vs. Jingji (Group A2B) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Shanghai Police vs. Haiqing (Group A1) 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Hualian vs. Encars (Group A1) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>In Group A1, Hualian is a perennial winner. After being defeated by Huili, Encars has lost three times, and its hope for the championship is slim. However, the team has a long history in Shanghai and understands the methods of fighting against Chinese teams. Therefore, it is still a concern for Hualian. Kairoski is gradually recovering to normal, Begni is in excellent condition, and the veteran cunning of Chilibo Tuofu Nik and Ge Peng Qi Gu Fu is still strong. They had a friendly match with Hualian during the Lunar New Year, resulting in a 37-41 defeat. Today is a good opportunity for revenge. Hualian is the only undefeated team in Group A1. Haiqing, Mailinges, Huili, Renyu, and Peifeier have all surrendered. Tonight, with the momentum of five consecutive victories, they should be able to pass this test and maintain their undefeated record. The strengths of the two sides are not much different. At that time, the dragon and tiger will fight fiercely, and wonderful performances will emerge one after another.</p>
<p>In Group A2B, Hezhong will face Jingji. The former has many old friends in the team, such as Li Jiazhi, Li Peidong, and Dong Shaotang, who have been in the arena for a long time. Jingji is a newly emerging force. In the Chengyou Cup, they achieved brilliant results. In the preliminary round of this group, they defeated Wuxi Post and Telecommunications Team. Tonight, when they meet Hezhong for the first time, there will be a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Shanghai Police will face Haiqing. Shanghai Police is the transformed version of the Chengyou Cup champion Fangyou Team. This is their first time participating in the league, with four wins and one loss. Currently, their situation is second only to Hualian. If they can defeat the foreign soldiers tonight, then the final game of the first round against Hualian will be even more important. Haiqing is a US Navy team from Qingdao. They have reported to the committee and have made major changes to their lineup compared to the previous team. However, it is said that their strength is still strong, and they are not here for a friendly visit. The generals of Shanghai Police should be careful.</p>
<p>[Hualian] Ren Xiangcheng, Li Zhenzhong, Wu Chengzhang, Le Jiazhou, Fu Jinsheng, Bao Songyuan, Liu Fushan, Li Hanting, Zhang Liangxiong.</p>
<p>[Encars] Chilibo Tuo, Kairoski, Ge Peng Qi Gu Fu, Ao Chai Liao, Fu Nik, Fu Ke, Begni, Sha Sijin.</p>

<h3>Hotel Industry Raises Base Room Rates, Social Bureau Sends Personnel for Strict Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The calculation method for adjusting room rates in the hotel industry in this city, as approved by the city government, is to multiply the pre-war room rate (each yuan converted to 2.2 gold yuan) by the cost of living index to arrive at the current room rate. For those who opened before the war, the room rate can be verified by the account books. Those who opened during or after the war should refer to the pre-war room rates of similar hotels, and the guild will verify the base room rate and report it to the Social Bureau for processing. Since the implementation, the Social Bureau has repeatedly received reports that some hotels in the industry have raised the rates to a great extent in an attempt to profit. It has sent personnel to conduct a strict investigation and severely punish them. The bureau also hopes that citizens will report any discoveries at any time.</p>
<h3>Poor Children's Work-Study Institute Raises Operating Expenses, Holds Radio Appeal for Basic Donors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute on Jiangwan Xinshi Road in this city held a special program on Jindou Radio yesterday to raise operating expenses and daily necessities.

The Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute was established in 1949. The entire institute covers an area of 15 mu, including a self-cultivated small farm of 4 mu. It currently has 75 orphans. It combines education, care, and skills training to help them serve the society in the future. However, due to limited economic conditions, life is extremely difficult. There are currently only 20 thatched houses, and there is no water or electricity. The institute hopes to replace the thatched houses with two-story tiled houses, increase the number of students admitted, and add various light industries to supplement expenses and benefit the students by learning skills on-site. Since City Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan took office as the chairman of the institute, he has been determined to realize the above-mentioned hopes. A few days ago, Chairman Zhang held a board meeting at the Daguan Society. Honorary Director Pan Gongzhan, Director Ding Fubao, and many executive directors attended the meeting. It was resolved that, in order to solve the economic problems of the institute, a search for basic donors would be conducted, with 500 units per month and 10 yuan as the base number, to be collected monthly based on the cost of living index, so as to achieve a permanent solution. In addition, the institute is still short of 20,000 yuan for the monthly food expenses for purchasing rice. Honorary Director Pan Gongzhan generously donated on the spot, so the institute has no worries about rice for this month.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Branches in Various Regions Offer Loans for Production Enterprises</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Because industrial and mining production enterprises in various regions have been deeply affected by price fluctuations, resulting in sluggish sales and a shortage of funds, the 27th Discount Committee meeting resolved to formulate "Precautions for Central Bank Branches in Various Regions to Handle Loans," totaling 11 articles. The main points of its content are as follows: (1) In order to handle loans, National Bank branches in various regions may organize a loan review committee, with the local branch manager serving as the convener, inviting impartial figures from the financial community to participate. (2) Loans under 250,000 gold yuan will be handled in accordance with the small factory loan program, releasing funds first and reporting later. The amount of the loan will be based on the number of workers. (3) Industries with high profits, such as cigarette, cigar, construction, cotton spinning, film production, soda, juice, and ice cream industries, will not be lent to. The household chemical industry will be limited to toothpaste, tooth powder, and soap. (4) Loans between 250,000 and 600,000 gold yuan may be handled in accordance with the same industry discount rules, underwritten by national banks, bureaus, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks, and may apply to the local national bank branch for relending. (5) Loans exceeding 600,000 yuan must be submitted to the discount committee for approval on a case-by-case basis. (6) Loan interest rates: The original term for Category A industries was 90 days, with a monthly interest rate of 1.5 jiao, reduced by 0.5 jiao for relending. The original loan term for Category B, C, and D industries and industries other than Category A was 60 days, with an original loan interest rate of 2.4 jiao, reduced by 0.4 jiao for relending.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Rebounds, Cotton Cloth Turns Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market rebounded. The morning opened with news that new economic measures were about to be announced. According to general speculation, their content would not have a significant impact on industry and commerce, so the general psychology changed. Moreover, the silver market was loose and flooded, and all parties had a strong appetite. The buying frenzy suddenly started, and all yarns soared.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 580,000 yuan to 650,000 yuan at closing, an increase of 80,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 35,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at 440,000 yuan, once reaching as high as 500,000 yuan, and finally staying at the 500,000 yuan mark, an increase of 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse appeared to open at a low of 360,000 yuan, reaching a high of 430,000 yuan midway, and slightly retreated to 415,000 yuan at noon closing, an increase of 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Next-day trading was at 425,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse rose by 55,000 yuan, ending at 370,000 yuan. Other yarns such as Tiannv and Jincheng also rose by about 15%. All grades below 16-count were firm.</p>
<p>The trend of cotton cloth showed slight progress. The silver market on the market turned loose, and the prices of items outside the circle rose, boosting people's confidence. Buyers had a slight interest in entering the market, but customer sales were still sluggish, so it was feared that the firm trend would not last.</p>
<p>Because Fangjian has still not started selling fine cloth recently, the chips on the market have become increasingly scarce, and trading has not been included in the right track. Although there were calls for opening outside the market, there were few transactions, presenting a situation of having a market but no goods. Yesterday, the initial call was 15,500 yuan, reaching as high as 16,000 yuan at noon, an increase of 800 yuan. Trumpet Boy fine cloth and B Fangjian fine cloth finally traded at 13,500 yuan each, an increase of about 600 yuan compared to the previous day. Other grades of fine cloth also showed a slight improvement.</p>
<p>Si Junzi Yuan Bi Ji opened at 13,100 yuan and then reached as high as 14,000 yuan. The noon closing was 13,900 yuan, a rise of 600 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Bi Ji also rose by 600 yuan. It was heard in the afternoon that black and red yarns had soared, and all cloths were firm again.</p>
<h3>China Textile Sells Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company put up a sign in the market again yesterday to sell yarn, selling a total of 941 pieces, worth 44,442,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The selling prices and purchase quotas for each type of yarn are as follows: 6-count Fu Riguang 54 pieces, price 120,000 yuan. 8-count Riguang 26 pieces, price 160,000 yuan. 21-count Xiantao second-class 50 pieces, price 320,000 yuan. 32-count Xihe 200 pieces, price 410,000 yuan. 32-count double-strand Xihe 92 pieces, price 500,000 yuan. 42-count double-strand 250 pieces, price 540,000 yuan. 42-count double-strand Lima 200 pieces, price 560,000 yuan. 42-count double-strand mercerized color ball 69 pieces, price 620,000 yuan.</p>

Selling prices: 16-count Hongyue 310,000 yuan, 32-count Riguang 450,000 yuan, 32-count double-strand Fengnian 560,000 yuan, 40-count Hong Shiguan 540,000 yuan, 40-count TK Riguang 720,000 yuan, 42-count double-strand Longmen 590,000 yuan, 60-count Gongnv 700,000 yuan, 80-count double-strand TK color ball 1,800,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Exchanged for Yarn: Labor Costs Severely Insufficient</h3>
<p>Various Parties Request Constant Adjustments</p>
<p>The 32nd Standing Committee Meeting of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association was held yesterday. During the meeting, the application of using American aid cotton to exchange for yarn labor costs for factories 2, 3, and 5 was discussed. Originally, it barely covered the costs, but now, due to volatile prices and a sharp increase in the cost of living, the actual labor costs are severely insufficient. Furthermore, the consolidated tax is adjusted every half month, and if no adjustments are made, the burden will be unbearable. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Sixth District Association requesting a remedy and reasonable adjustments at any time. The association is currently discussing detailed technical measures to be submitted to the authorities for review and implementation.</p>
<h3>Flourishing of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>A Total of Twenty-Two Varieties Opened</p>
<p>Two-Thirds Reached the Upper Limit</p>
<p>Reports indicate that the economic plan is not as severe as rumored, which does not hinder the stock market. Moreover, with the recovery of prices, stock prices are showing a boost. Furthermore, with abundant credit and a sharp drop in market interest rates, the stock market is flourishing even more. A total of twenty-two varieties opened. By noon, fourteen varieties had reached the upper limit, a general increase of up to twenty percent compared to the previous day. The overall stock market situation also showed some prosperity, with a total transaction volume reaching 2.766 billion shares. Among them, the state-owned Taiwan Sugar took the lead in hitting the limit, with demand far exceeding supply, accounting for 430 shares. Private stocks also saw increases. In the morning, Taiwan Sugar opened half a percent higher and rose to the limit in about ten minutes. Yung Shing Yarn also showed a sharp upward trend, with the morning price at 2.37 yuan, quickly surpassing 2.40 yuan and then consolidating slightly. Other stocks followed suit due to the strong support from banks. Chen's Lacquer and New Asia remained the leaders, continuing to rise to the limit. Around 11:30, New Rice, Jingfu Matches, Yong Gong, Hsin Yee, Da Tong, Sino-French, China Cement, Rong Feng, and Commercial Press all reached the limit. Yung Shing Yarn also reached the limit again due to fierce competition among peers. American Asia also briefly reached the limit. In the last half hour, all stocks maintained a firm upward trend, closing with a promising outlook.</p>
<h3>Loose Credit, Lower Interbank Lending Rates</h3>
<p>Gold Public Bond Prices Rise Again</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Certificates Break the 2,000 Barrier</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market credit remained loose. Various industries adopted a wait-and-see attitude due to the imminent announcement of the new economic plan, unsure of whether it would be beneficial or detrimental. The supply of funds was abundant, while demand was scarce, and the market interbank lending rate fluctuated between 40 and 50 yuan for overnight loans. Near noon, the market was flooded with excessive orders, and the phenomenon of forced lending was widespread.</p>
<p>After several days of tight cash, yesterday also saw a return to an ample situation. The amount of withdrawals from banks and financial institutions increased to over 10,000 yuan. The number of bank drafts decreased significantly, and the discount rate for large amounts in the market also decreased to about 0.02 yuan per yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign exchange transfer certificates rose sharply again, opening at 1,920 yuan. Importers continuously purchased them, and designated banks competed to absorb them. Furthermore, due to the high price of US dollars on the black market, credit in the industry was abundant. The price once rose as high as 2,150 yuan for buying and 2,250 yuan for selling. The closing price was 2,120 yuan for buying and 2,150 yuan for selling. Transactions by banks amounted to 550,000 US dollars, including 250,000 US dollars by several import and export companies such as Dah Lee International and Jian Hua, and 150,000 US dollars by commercial designated banks, totaling 950,000 US dollars.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the National Bank's quoted price for short-term gold public bonds was 89,000 yuan per tael, 3,500 yuan higher than the previous quote.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Export Exchange Settlement: Amount of Gold Decreases Compared to Previous Period</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Report) The Export Control Commission announced yesterday that the amount of foreign exchange settlement applied for Shanghai's export goods last week (from the 13th to the 19th) decreased significantly compared to the previous week. The total amount, converted to US dollars, was $2,727,818.75. This included $1,428,157.91 for government self-settlement (i.e., frozen eggs, gauze, ore, sugar, etc.). A total of eighteen types of commodities applied for foreign exchange settlement, with cotton yarn accounting for the largest share, totaling $819,010.70. The second largest was textiles, totaling $609,147.21. The third largest was pig bristles, totaling $243,238.67.</p>
<h3>Export Control Not Abolished</h3>
<p>Improvement Measures Under Consideration</p>
<p>Recently, various industrial and commercial circles in the city have suggested to the authorities that the Import and Export Control Commission be abolished. Yesterday, Xie Renzhao, the secretary of the commission, told reporters that due to the current lack of foreign exchange in China, it is absolutely impossible to open up free import and export trade. This is not unique to China; nine out of ten countries in the world are unable to open up free trade. Under the current circumstances, China will never abolish the export control system, and therefore the Export Control Commission will not be abolished either. Currently, the commission has drafted a new method to facilitate the business development of importers and exporters, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to be reviewed by relevant departments such as the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Many improvements have been made to the aspects of export control that importers and exporters were dissatisfied with in the past, and suggestions from the industrial and commercial sectors have also been adopted as much as possible to reduce the difficulties for importers and exporters.</p>
<h3>Reserve Ratio Unchanged, Interest Settlement Changed to Monthly</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the deposit reserve ratio, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance have decided not to change it after consultation. However, in the past, interest was settled once every six months, but now it has been changed to once a month. The interest rate remains at 0.12 yuan per month, which is a disguised increase.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Discussions on Ningzhou black tea, which had been put on hold some days ago, continued actively yesterday, but the sellers continued to raise prices due to weak inventory and the recovery of foreign exchange transfer certificates, with asking prices reaching around 80,000 yuan per dan. However, buyers were only offering around 70,000 yuan per dan, and transactions remained deadlocked. The market atmosphere was quite solid. The supply and demand of other varieties were also imbalanced, but sentiment remained strong, and the situation remained firm amidst quietness.</p>
<h3>Lumber Stabilized</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of fir has been firm in Fujian, and the Shanghai market price has reached 70 yuan yesterday. If calculated in foreign exchange, the cost of foreign pine is around 300 yuan. However, a large amount of privately sold goods (privately sold by a certain institution) have recently appeared on the market, causing the market price to plummet.</p>
<h3>Cargo Owners Eager to Sell, Rice Still Trending Down, Flour Stops Falling and Rises, Edible Oil Rises</h3>
<p>Although prices of various commodities rose yesterday, the rice market still saw a squeeze and fall. Because the drop on the previous day was not significant, the rice market had already closed when other prices surged yesterday. When the market opened, many cargo owners were eager to sell, and white rice once fell by 500-600 yuan. Later, hearing that the black market gold price rose, it rebounded slightly. As a result, white rice traded at 10,100 yuan, a small squeeze of 400 yuan. Bo Dao, early rice, and indica rice each fell by 300-400 yuan. The Beishi market saw a small decrease of 400 yuan for japonica and indica rice, with early rice entering the 10,000 yuan mark. The registered arrivals yesterday totaled 6,613 shi in both markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Stopped falling and rose. The initial market was relatively stable, but as credit loosened, various parties made slight additions. However, with the implementation of the new economic plan imminent, most buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude and dared not buy in large quantities. After the market closed, the Pudong gang bought in large quantities, and the Beibang also inquired. Sentiment turned bullish, and with the support of holders, the market rose sharply. The Bingchuan futures market rose to 4,480 yuan, and the old Che reached 4,800 yuan. Bran did not rise much. Fuxin's large package traded at 3,470 yuan today, and no transactions were seen after the market closed.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The market turned firm, especially with soybeans surging due to the sharp rise in oil cakes, factory stomachs were concentrated, and Che beans rose sharply by more than 20%. Linhuai Pass quickly knocked on the 10,000 yuan mark, and Hankou Che Huang shouted 9,500 yuan. Raw peanuts rose by 10%, and red sorghum, corn, and tea beans all rose across the board. Only sesame turned dull in the local market, and the market fell back by 1,000 yuan. Hankou white sesame traded at 14,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The market rose again. Due to loose credit and the rise in black market gold prices, it followed suit and rose. Soybean oil once surged past the 50,000 yuan mark, but fell back to 47,000 yuan at the close, a squeeze of 4,000 yuan. Vegetable oil also rose by 10%. Jiton's raw oil was 53,000 yuan, and Xiaoche sesame oil rose back to 47,000 yuan. Soybean cake also rose sharply, with Changzi cake at 4,800 yuan, a rise of more than 20%.</p>
