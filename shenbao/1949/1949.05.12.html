<p>〔本報福州十一日電〕九日中央社滬電軍方發表閩北楓嶺發生激戰，頃據此間當局表示該訊不確。按五日浙匪有越仙霞嶺南擾模樣，至八日在國軍嚴密監視下回竄，并未發生戰事。現閩境安謐無事，土共在強大國軍監視下亦鮮活動餘地。</p>

<h3>京「人民政府」成立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據南京來人談，京市人民政府正式宣告成立，市劉伯承，副市長柯慶施，張霖之。</p>
<h3>傅秉常在港演講　蘇聯近況</h3>
<p>〔聯合社香港十一日電〕報載中國駐蘇大使傅秉常十一日在香港大學校長會演講，報告蘇聯近況，據稱，蘇聯之宗教自由已在逐漸恢復中，蘇聯對宗教態度之轉變乃戰時蘇聯軍人家屬，為遠征軍祈禱安全之結果。蘇聯之離婚案件亦已較戰前減少，此乃實施新離婚法律之效騐。此項法律目的在安定家庭，因多數在外國服務之蘇聯人，容易鍾情於外國女人，而欲與其本國妻子離婚。</p>
<h3>中共區對外貿易　外商感失望</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十一日電〕紐約前鋒論壇報駐遠東記者史迪祿，自漢城撰寄一文，刋登於此間時事新報。內稱：中共在東北與華北所實施之對外貿易，已使中國倒退一百年，中共對於貿易及外匯所實施之嚴格與不合理管制，使甚多外國商人感覺失望，蓋彼等向期望中共能作公平之交易也。平津之大部外國商行，對於中共政權下之未來貿易，均表悲觀。中共對於外商貿易之干涉，極其官僚化與不合理，其手續較之中國政府更為繁瑣。對外貿易有百分之六十以上，均由華北貿易局壟斷，故普通商人已無活動之餘地。華北之大規模私人實業似開　煤礦等，刻均因勞工問題，共方對於管理及財務之橫加干預，其經營日增困難。在中共治下中外或蘇聯與英美商號之間，并無分別，然中共對於華北美商特別苛刻，其處境甚窘，華北英商銀行獲准繼續營業，而華北外國商業與貿易，雖有半數屬於美國，美國銀行則已停業。</p>
<h3>顧維鈞大使　與艾卿晤談</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十一日廣播：中國駐美大使與艾契遜晤談半小時後，對記者發表談話稱：渠曾要求艾氏考慮美國參加類似大西洋公約之太平洋區域條約，俾向民主主義之敵國明白表示美國對亞洲共產黨之進展，與其他地方同樣關切。</p>
<h3>港續增強防衛力量　飛機一今自星洲飛港　英政府官員認中共尚不致攻港</h3>
<p>〔路透社馬尼刺十日電〕此間正式宣佈：皇家空軍飛機一隊，計陸上飛機十五架，桑特蘭式水上飛機一架，將於十二日自新加坡抵此轉赴香港，作例有的練習飛行。</p>
<p>〔路透社香港十一日電〕可靠方面息：英陸軍部隊不久即將開始在香港對岸九龍三百五十方哩之區域內經常巡邏，原駐該處之英軍野戰砲聯隊及古加步兵營，亦將增強實力。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社坎白拉十日電〕澳政府方面日前稱，香港若受威脅而要求援助時，澳政府將立即予以注意，但同一方面謂，澳洲在此問題上不致采取主動，彼等指稱，齊夫萊首相曾謂，澳洲尚未自英國接獲任何增強香港之請求。</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦十日電〕消息靈通人士十日聲稱，中共軍隊雖漸接近香港，但英政府并不預料中共將對香港作任何大規模之攻擊。英方承認香港之主要危險，乃為「反叛分子」發動內部騷擾之可能性，故已採取警戒辦法，增援香港英駐軍。</p>
<p>某官員稱，「英軍六千名將續駐香港，并無問題，駐軍經增援後，可望保衛該殖民地以抗任何大規模之軍事攻擊，但我人并無預料香港將遭大規模軍事攻擊之理由，」該官員又稱，現在并無計劃撤退香港婦孺之問題，如一九四〇年日軍結集於香港邊境一帶時辦理之撤退工作然。</p>
<p>戰前駐中國英軍工兵隊長柯克上校，頃責難英內閣增援香港之決議，稱：香港駐軍共地六千人「絕對不足」，僅港島之周圍為二十五哩，香港對面租借地海岸綫則達一百哩，六千英軍中，每一士兵須保衛一千碼以上海岸綫，以防潛在力強大之共軍。</p>
<p>關於海軍觀點方面，據一度曾在中國服役之貝爾上校稱，保衛香港，以海軍為主，若無航空母艦，不能作有效之防衛，苟無空中協助，該殖民地必陷落，僅航空母艦能供給空中協助。而航空母艦若以地中海為根據地，則對香港并無多大用處。</p>
<h3>阻止中共推進　目前猶未為晚</h3>
<p>周以德在紐約談稱</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十一日電〕共和黨眾議員周以德十一夜在宗教集會中演說稱，美國嘗試阻止共產主義推進，時間猶未為晚。</p>

<p>〔本報漢口十一日電〕軍息：漢口外圍守軍今配合重砲，分路向蔡甸·張家灣·擊馬口等地出擊，甚為得手，刻正繼續推進中。又，連日我空軍飛往漢口以北之祁家灣，轟擊共軍，戰果甚佳。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十一日電〕武漢保衛戰進入第三日，自晨至晚，砲聲隆隆，清晰可聞，市民頗現慌張之色，全市商店多閉戶，街衢崗警密佈，行人頓形減少，蓋不知砲聲發自何方也。晚八時砲聲漸見稀疏。記者訪軍方某要員，據稱：漢口東北廿里以外有土共六千人活動，當經國軍迎擊，并以重砲助戰，共軍不支，已被迫北退二里許，刻國軍正繼續掃蕩中，請轉告市民，砲係發自國軍陣地，實無須自相驚擾云。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十一日電〕十一日為武漢保衛戰之第三日，魯道源司令官特令武漢外圍守軍向三道橋之匪出擊，并由空軍協助作戰，戰鬥至為慘烈。下午二時起，武漢市面可聞隆隆砲擊，路人爭相奔馳，商店紛紛關門，市況淒涼。記者特赴訪武漢守備司令部發言人黃聲遠，據稱：此次戰鬥係我軍主動出擊，砲聲即係我方所發，三道橋之匪已向漲口方面潰退，同時我軍另一部，由下集向李家崗許家灣之匪二千餘名攻擊，先後攻佔李家崗許家灣等地，計斃匪四百餘名，鹵獲機槍三挺，步槍八十餘支，我陣亡排長一員，士兵五十七名。漢陽方面十日晚，我軍向蔡甸班集附近掃蕩，匪已被迫後退，我軍正在尾追中。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口十日電〕武漢保衛戰今為第三日，北郊之諶家磯·聶江及及豐荷山均有砲戰，下午一時左右市內可聞清晰砲聲，惟一般市民尚稱鎮靜。</p>
<h3>廣州接獲可靠消息　傅作義已自殺　曾圖逃入國軍區未遂</h3>
<p>〔聯合社廣州十一日電〕今日據可靠消息：前華北軍事長官傅作義已於昨日自殺。傅氏嘗試逃入國軍區域未遂，被共方領袖逼迫出此。此乃傅氏與共軍司令部多月來糾紛之結果，共軍當局要求傅部軍隊併入共軍。</p>
<h3>英大使館留駐南京　倫敦輿論予指斥　「係將塵埃散於自己眼中」</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十日電〕「經濟學家」雜誌今日載文評論中國局勢　其標題為「曖昧之駐華大使館」。文中稱，「中共已在北平電台中重行要求英國軍艦對所作之　暴行動提出歉意，且賠償損失。但在此種有利條件下，即使中國雙方皆可能採取對英友善之外交政策，則吾人仍將慎重考慮。國際法使吾人不能急促在一個受各國承認之政府仍保有大部份國土時，即在外交上認可一叛黨。何況此兩方面并不同樣友善。一方面具有與西方各國維持合理友好關係之歷史，而另一方則已宣稱在任何因大西洋公約而發生之戰爭中，將為蘇聯之盟友。若犧牲一最不滿意之友人而以外交承認之利益賦於敵人，則實屬不智，且有人謂，英國大使之留居南京，乃欲與中共進行私人接觸，以獲得紫水晶號之釋放。但與雙方同時具有使節，并非對最重要問題之解決，此問題為：何一政府有權使用中國政府之外國資產？何一政府有權任命駐各國大使，及至聯合國代表，駐東京盟國管制委員會代表，或中國因東南亞各地領事？吾人必需將此權力加予雙方中之一方面。英國駐華大使若與中共當局會商，而同時則派遣一較低級之代表至廣州，無異將中共置於較國民政府更高之地位。若屬如此，則中共設要求另派駐英大使，或動用中國在英之英鎊存款時，英政府將取何種態度？美國方面之企圖召回其大使，即欲避免此左右為難之問題，誠如彼等在事前將軍艦撤出長江，而能避免英海軍所受之損失，美國之對華政策，為「等待至塵埃落地後」，英國之政策，則欲為將塵埃散於自己兩眼中。</p>
<h3>各校學生膳費　發放辦法改善</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十一日電〕教部發言人詹絜悟頃對記者發表關於各校學生膳費發放情形時稱：本部對各校學生膳費，凡經核准有案者，均由部遵照行政院核定辦法發給，其標準為每生每月食米二市斗三升，按照市價發款，副食費按基數十元乘生活指數，逐月調整，此項經費每月均先行墊發，例如五月份學生膳費，在本月初即照上月數先墊，以便各校預先購糧，不致受米價上漲之影響，如中途米價暴漲時，仍陸續增加墊款。自五月份起，主副食費擬一律改照關元計算，正與主計·財政兩部洽商中。詹氏又稱：本部希望各校主持人，對於學生膳食負責監督，領到部款後，即行購糧，準備全月之用，以免受物價波動影響。</p>
<h3>政院例會通過任免案　孫繼丁代長青市　財次夏晉熊準辭以姚書閣繼任</h3>

<h3>日軍三萬抵穗　全屬無稽之談</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十一日電〕據政府發言人鮑靜安宣稱：今日香港某報載稱，日軍三萬人到達廣州之說，完全為無稽之談。查廣州市民甚多，如有三萬日軍到達，早應傳遍全城，何以廣州各報均無此消息，廣州人民對此亦無所悉，政府對此大批軍隊，事實上無法將其全部掩蔽，足證此項消息之荒謬。</p>

<p>〔本報福州十一日電〕榕人為米荒已解除，上游米船連日湧到，每石已恢復半月前舊價金一錢二分五，低於市府一錢三之限價。然連日物價又因人心欠穩而大漲，十一日袁洋每個七百五十萬，各貨隨漲六成。</p>
<h3>港將採銀本位說　莫爾斯予以否認</h3>
<p>〔聯合社香港十一日電〕匯豐銀行經理莫爾斯十一日稱，上海某報載香港或將採取銀本位之說，純屬無稽之談。余亦曾聞白銀運往華南之謠言，但絕無白銀運來香港。</p>

<h3>西北行</h3>
<p>— 陳香梅</p>
<p>四月一日乘機離廣州，到西北去。</p>
<p>沿途經重慶，轉漢中，入蘭州。然後到寗夏。寗夏歸來再回蘭州飛青海都會西寗。全程數千里，為時一週。八日晚返羊城，燈火家家，已入暮暮時節。</p>
<p>這次的旅行很有趣，看了許多沒有看過的地方與人物。假如說南方是嬌柔的，那麼西北就是壯麗的。南方二八佳人唱「楊柳岸曉風殘月」。北方像魁梧大漢唱「大江東去」。</p>
<p>重慶：</p>
<p>嘉陵蜀道三千里，</p>
<p>處處寒山呌畫眉。</p>
<p>三月的山城，春已將盡。剛好是沒有霧的日子，從白市驛坐汽車入城，費了一個多鐘頭，沿路大山山嶺何祗千百，戰時的防空洞多半已用木柵封住，其中少數則住了人。</p>
<p>路過嘉陵江，嘉陵江水正是潮退的時候，水淺的很。看見江水，容易使人回憶戰時的重慶，那個時候，這個山城多麼熱鬧！如今則一切都沉寂了，像潮水退後的沙灘。</p>
<p>晚上住在勵志社，這是一所三層樓的洋房，很精緻，浴室的裝置要比廣州的好得多，雖然沒有熱水，可是冷水是不悉中斷的。不過電燈電力之差，可與廣州的「鬼火」媲美。</p>
<p>住過重慶的人，大概總沒有忘記重慶的老鼠。四川耗子可說是世無其匹的。晚上，老鼠大哥在房裏昂然闊步。好像無帥檢閱三軍，其他在房中來去自如，目中無人，也使你嘆為觀止。</p>
<p>重慶的人力車依然和以前的一樣破舊，或許可以說比以前更為破舊，重慶的天氣，還是那樣沉鬱，只有一樣，重慶不似昔年熱鬧了。</p>
<p>再見重慶使人懷念到抗戰的日子，好像比現在至少好過一點，照這樣說來，我們所等候，所期望的好日子，要在那一天纔來呢？</p>
<p>蘭州：</p>
<p>在重慶住了兩天，四月三日飛蘭州。</p>
<p>蘭州是甘肅的省會，甘肅省主席郭寄　即常駐此間。到了那兒我們得到郭主席夫婦的盛意招待，我們住在澄清關，我們留宿的房間是在戰時招待過蔣總統夫婦，華萊士（我們并不願與華萊士攪在一起，特此聲明）威爾基，馬歇爾，英大使史諦芬等人物的。建築非常現代化，園中亭台樓閣，應有盡存。屋後有樓，名曰望河樓，在那兒可以看見滾滾黃河，川流不息。即唐詩所謂「黃河遠上白云間，千里江陵萬仭山，羌笛何須怨楊柳，春風不度玉門關」。</p>
<p>甘肅省是入西北的大門，要入西北必定要經過甘肅，古時是兵家必守之地，如今隨着時局的進展，這兒的地位也日漸顯要。郭主席帶兵駐守此間，其任務是不言而喻的。</p>
<p>晚間郭主席招飲，飲的是葡萄酒，據說是蘭州的特產，其味香醇，也很易醉。席間有舞會，收音機所播送的全是美國音樂，幾不相信身在蘭州。</p>
<p>蘭州據說在夏天天氣很涼，是避暑的理想地方，而且沒有蚊蟲，那時葉綠花紅，又是各種瓜果上市的時候。郭主席說，夏天一定要請我們來過暑。</p>
<p>寗夏：</p>
<p>四日抵寗夏，也是到了道地的西北。</p>
<p>飛機沿着黃河而上，山川都是一片土黃，屋舍也漸稀少。我們知道我們已到了道地的西北。</p>
<p>寗夏省主席馬鴻逵夫婦親自到機場來迎接。我對馬主席夫婦久已聞名，他們的一言一笑，一舉一動真是恰如其人。馬主席現在正患着嚴重的糖尿症，體重日增，所以走起路來很不方便。馬夫人則患着初期的小兒麻痹症，也是步履維艱，我們要他們躬親來迎接，心中非常過意不去。</p>
<p>我們所住的房子是經過馬夫人扶病起牀來佈置的，一共費了三天三夜的工夫。在那兒有法國的沙發牀，有紐約的裝飾品，而使我訂為奇跡的是有冷熱自來水，有霓紅燈，馬夫人還為我們在臥房裏燃了薰香，養了紅梅，泡了北平的香片茶，垂了火爐，掛了繡簾。舒秘書伯炎一進房間就說：「這是皇宮」！是的，這是皇宮，且讓我們今霄做個皇帝夢。</p>
<p>馬主席於二十二年春率部至寗夏，至今已將二十年。蒞任之初，民窮財匱，閭闔不安。而經過他清丈地畝，整理金融，興舉做保甲，水利，植樹，與農民貸款等工作後，這貧乏的地區已漸有進展。而馬主席的軍隊對於殲匪工作更是不遺餘力。三十六年冬曾派隊馳解榆林之圍，大破彭德懷之主力。現在保衛大西北聲中，他的宗旨仍是一貫的。</p>
<p>為了使陳將軍明瞭西北的防衛，在我們抵寗夏的第二天，馬主席招了一萬多軍隊請陳將軍檢閱，其中包括騎兵，步兵，與砲兵。在那廣大的操場上黃塵滾滾，一萬多官兵作種種操練，蔚為壯觀。</p>
<p>賀蘭山凡在寗夏省，大家總沒有忘記岳飛的壯語，所謂「駕長　，踏破了賀蘭山厥；壯志飢餐胡虜肉，笑談渴飲匈奴血！」是也。</p>
<p>西北人都有打共產黨的決心，他們大都是回教徒，與共產主義誓不兩立。現在西北正在準備聯防，馬主席說他—有生一日即不許寗夏赤化，即是他死了，還有他的兒子，還有他的孫子，他們是要抵抗到底的。</p>
<p>青海：</p>
<p>行人刁斗風沙暗，公主琵琶幽怨多。野營萬里無城郭，雨雪紛紛連大漠。—李頎—</p>
<p>青海的風沙好大，青海的男兒好壯，青海的馬兒真好，青海的羊肉真香，還有那兒的姑娘也很漂亮。這是我們青海的印象。</p>
<p>從機場驅車到城裏，我的頭髮從黑變成灰白，因為沿途風沙撲面吹來，使人睜不開眼睛，路上的樹木也還未發青，未開花。隴上羊羣三五，馬匹無數，地闊天長，黃沙漠漠，一片西北的歲寒圖。</p>
<p>馬主席步芳不但是一位能幹的領導者，而且是一位摯誠的回教徒。他的唯一的兒子馬繼援現在正領導着四五萬大軍駐守在甘肅青海的交界處。去年平凉之役，大敗赤匪，聲譽大震。據說共黨看見他所領導的大刀隊即不戰而退。有許多美國記者曾去前綫訪問他，稱他的回教英雄。</p>
<p>馬主席治青海很有成績，軍政方面在地方上的表現即可以見到，而在教育方面則更有成就，我們曾參觀兩所學校，都非常滿意。西寗市內有一所幼稚園，學生在一千四百人以上。中學共有兩所，此外還有女子師範。晚間馬主席請我們出席學生的歡迎會，由學生們作各種表演。從學生們的表演中可以看到他們所受的教育與訓練是以保衛家鄉，保衛青海為主。節目裏有「四度玉門關」，「團結是力量」等，都是非常有意義的題材。</p>
<p>清真教徒吃的都是羊肉，有煮的，有烤的，有煮的。其中以烤的最為美味可口；米糧很少，多的是麵。蓮子和茶葉都是珍饈。若是那兒的人用蓮子羹來招待你的話那是最了不起的了。據說一盆蓮子等於一桌酒席，信不信由你。</p>
<p>值得一提的是青海省的治安，在那兒我看不到一個警察，城門也沒有警衛，人們出入自如，可是沒有強盜，也沒有共產黨，晚上也不用戒嚴。這種內心的安寗在今日的中國實不易找到。</p>
<p>青海的人很質樸，很老實。不過他們是能戰之士，他們是不怕死的。回教徒的婦女似乎沒有什麼地位，不過現在也比以前好多了。我看見許多臉兒紅紅的姑娘在路上走，她們以前隻好關在屋裡，如今算是開禁了。</p>
<p>西北所給我的印象是深刻的，雄偉的，明朗的。那兒的山川是宏壯的，那兒的人是刻苦的。黃河流域穿過了起伏不平的土地，不停息的流着，每年泛濫，為人民帶來了無盡的痛苦。啊，這是大地的嘆息！</p>
<p>然而西北也有不少寶藏，它等待着我們去開發。那兒有的是處女地，經過了幾許年月仍是靜靜地躺着，讓沙漠的暴風把她掩蓋，寂寂無聞。</p>
<p>西北地廣人稀，加以因為數十年來得不到中央的扶助，所以人民雖在不斷奮鬥仍然免不了窮困。如今西北的地位已日見重要，大好河山，我們應當如何珍惜纔是！</p>

<h3>社論　發行地方劵的原則</h3>
<p>金圓劵的發行，始終就沒有和財政隔離，睏此便注定了它悲慘的命運；并且還連帶的形成了今日經濟蕭條，金融紊亂，財政困難的局面。這種現象，影響於財金大計的，固屬不小；但貽害於地方民生的，更為深切。返來各地方政府以及民意機構，深感通貨膨脹的壓力，愈來愈重，為挽救金融經濟的危機起見，紛紛提議發行地方劵，且已有付諸實行的事實。中樞當局，雖然對這結舉動，表示不滿，但因由於金圓劵的本身不健全，故亦無法作行動上的制止。</p>
<p>在全國廣泛的地區內，除去了情形特殊的台灣和共軍的佔領區以外，差不多沒有一處沒有獨立的貨幣，如中央銀行將在華南發行銀元劵，雲南已發行半開爭元劵，福建，湖北，湖南，廣西，陝西，甘肅等省，已發行銀元輔幣劵，貴州亦在準備發行「省幣」，新疆，四川，西康等省并在醞釀發行銀元劵中，實際通用金圓劵　區域，可說只有上海一隅；因而通貨膨脹的損失，也不由上海少數人所負担了。上海雖一向為全國的富饒之區，但就財政負担的公平原則而言，這實在是異常欠妥的；何況在本市的一般階層中，公用事業有超特的「計價指數」，郵政電信有自訂的「郵電單位」，航空鐵路水運部都參照銀元收費，工商業出售貨物分別以金，鈔，銀元作價，江海關對進口貨以「關元」征稅，國稅局對工厰成品以「稅元」計收，它們都已聰明地避開了通貨膨脹的損失，試問這種損失的負担，究又落在誰的身上呢？</p>
<p>上海人民處在這樣惡劣的環境中，必須迅謀知處之道，才能抗拒通貨的暴力，維繫工商業的繁榮。上月月底，本市參議會議長潘公展及市商會代表嚴諤聲兩氏，在市府招待會席上，曾建議由本市商業行莊存足準備金，發行上海市地方劵，聞即席已獲得陳市長支持，但上項地方劵，遲至今日尚未有具體的辦法，亦未聞各方有何反響，實在使吾人異常沉悶，深盼有關各方，繼續努力，以求早日實現，而解民生於　　。</p>
<p>為了充分發揮地方劵的使用，事前不得不特別審慎將事，這裏吾人認為尤須遵守下列幾點原則：</p>
<p>第一，應認定地方劵之發行，係為純經濟的需要，不可受財政膨脹中軍事費用的壓力，而發行無度。</p>
<p>第二，須備足現金準備，以作人民隨時兌現之用，而奠定最基本的信用。</p>
<p>第三，發行機構要超然，切不可由中央銀行或市銀行主持發行事宜，最好交與本市較大的幾家商業行莊聯合發行，以免再受軍政費的牽制。</p>
<p>倘使地方劵能嚴看這幾項原則，實足準備，實足兌現，則發行的籌碼，不論是什麼紙幣，都可博得社會人士的信仰。至於技術方面的細節，如準備充足的輔幣，代理兌現行莊的手續，及與金圓的法定比率等，可留待發行的機構去商討。</p>
<p>上海發行地方劵是否仍可流通，此一問題，也是不可忽視的，目前有人以為如任令金圓劵仍在市面流通，不但人民生活水準要受到極大的影響，而且通貨的籌碼，反而格外的增多，形成通貨的更膨脹，這種顧慮，在理論上自有其存在的必要，不過就事實而論，本市發行地方幣，中央方面倘不持反對意見，則顯然本市對於通貨貶值損失的負担，已經獲得了減輕，縱然繼續受害，亦必較為輕微。再說上海的中央軍政機關林立，一切薪餉補給的費用，中央如不以金圓劵來支給，計將安出？故我們對於上項問題的折衷看法，不妨允許金圓劵和地方劵同時流通，但事實上經過了相當的時期以後，金圓劵自必隨着經濟上的自然趨勢，而遭到無情的淘汰。</p>
<h3>蘇州來客話風雨　區軍進城後第一步要慰勞品　工商業無生意勢將全部關門</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有客自蘇州來，對該地易手前後情形。述敘甚詳。</p>
<p>據謂：四月廿六日夜間，守軍主力已東撤，僅留少數殿後部隊於楓橋一帶。廿七日清晨，共軍於小接觸後，即進入盤門。是時，該地商店均閉門，但共軍於進入後，即挨戶敲開，囑照常開門營業，城區內於緊急期內，臨時組有商團防守，以免宵小趁火打刦，故秩序始終保持，商店及居民并未遭受損失。</p>
<p>不速客住民房</p>
<p>共軍開入蘇城者大部以急行軍穿過城區，出相門向蘇嘉路進發，餘者留守城內，普遍分散留居民房，凡住民之屋大人少者，均有此輩不速之客光臨，三五成羣，屋主敢怒而不敢言。</p>
<p>共軍入城後，即出佈告改蘇州為市，委派惠浴子·吳明為正副市長，并設立軍事管制委員會，以韋國清為主委。進城後第一步行動，為召集商會代表，要求慰勞品一批，內包括香煙三千條，襪三千打，米一萬担，大頭五千枚。并決定向地主借全年糧產四成。</p>
<p>接收者茫無知</p>
<p>此次江南國軍撤退，出共軍意料之外，故對一切接收工作，自認毫無準備。接收人員年事甚輕，普遍在二十左右，男女均有，知識水準大部為中學程度，對待接收機關之業務情形，茫然無知。金融機構之複雜，尤使渠等束手，據身與其事者估計，依現行速度辦理接收工作，起碼三個月能辦完。「人民銀行」蘇州分行經理首次召集行莊代表談話時，身穿士兵軍服，與會者均大吃一驚。</p>
<p>通貨之更換，事前亦無通盤計劃。</p>
<p>人民劵亦貶值</p>
<p>對金圓劵之收兌辦法，迄無規定。惟人民劵之幣值，亦在不斷跌落中，最初規定大頭一枚換人民劵四百元，但五天之後，黑市即高至七百四十元，百特亦隨之高漲，人民生活艱難。米價一度高至每担大頭九元，豬肉約每元三斤，蔬菜價格亦狂漲，小民都說「一蟹不如一蟹」。</p>
<p>以整個工商業而論，已入停頓狀態，商店雖勉強開門，但顧客寥若晨星，商界人士預測，情勢如不改觀，一兩月之內，根本將全部關門。一般平日以高利投機為專業之行莊，更屬面臨絕境，軍管會現正調查各行莊之股權情形，揚言如發現有官僚資本在內，定將予以充公。</p>
<p>私生活暫不管</p>
<p>對人民私生活之干涉，目前尚未開始，主要理由為政工人員尚未大批抵達，已到者人數太少，正房於其他接收工作，對管制工作，分明尚無暇及此。但軍管會確已向蘇北調用地方幹部一批，來蘇担任區長·鎮長等職，屆時人民之自由生活，可能告一段落。</p>

<h3>四強外長會議前夕　艾契遜闡明立塲　美出席代表團名單公布傑塞普波倫今日飛巴黎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十一日廣播：美國務卿艾契遜在記者招待會中稱，東西兩方是否能在四強外長會議中獲致協議，須親蘇聯是否願意支持西方國家，使德國併人和平的歐洲集團而定。艾氏又稱：美國政策在使德國統一，保證全體人民均享有基本民權。美國不擬接受不能保障此種基本權利之任何統一德國建議。艾氏盛讚西德領袖草擬德國聯邦憲法獲得團滿成績。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕「紐約時報」倫教記者報告稱，員文外相訪德歸來後，立即開始準備五月廿三日在巴黎舉行之區　外長會議。一般人士對於此次會議之收穫，尚有表示懷疑者。彼等認為除非蘇聯完全變更其在上屆外長會中所持之熊度，則巴黎會議難望有任何成就。就英美法三國言，彼等對於目標均持堅定熊度，彼等相信蘇聯之決定解除封鎖，僅為變更手段而非變更原則，其主要目標仍為將德國置入蘇聯勢力圈內。至目前為止，三強在巴黎會談中的目標已完全趨於一致，惟在會中所取手段或方策，尚待統一。此間觀察家相信，蘇聯在巴黎外長會中所取之政策，將以去年六月蘇聯與其衛星國在華沙所擬之德國計劃為基礎。該次會後發表之宣言，建議（一）完全解除德國武裝；（二）四強共管魯爾工業區；（三）四強就觀織各黨全德政府之事獲致協議；（四）與德締結和約，俾於和約簽字一年後撤退駐德佔領軍；（五）擬具使德給付賠償的措施。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十日電〕五月廿三日在巴黎開幕之外長會議，美國首席代表將由國務卿艾契遜担任，美無定所大使傑塞普將任交替代表。國務院今日公佈美代表國臨時人選如次：聯合國美代表杜爾斯將任代表團顧問，杜氏係共和黨外交問題專家之一。國務院德奧司長墨飛將任德國問題美國副代表，墨飛原係美駐德軍事長官古萊政治顧問。國務卿特別　辦白特爾及無定所大使特別幫辦岳斯特，將分任美主席代表及交替代表特別助理。國務院國際会議組长克契納將任代表團秘書長。代表團其他顾問計有國務院参議波倫，國務卿德奧事務幫辦皮姆，東歐司長賴哈特，德國政治事務組長特里維，德國經濟事務組組長賴因斯坦，德奧司職員哈萊遜，國務院德國問題法律顧問奧本哈墨。代表團新聞發佈將由國務院新聞連絡官麥克德　處理。傑塞普及波倫將於十二日赴巴黎，俾在外長會議揭幕前先作初步商談。艾契遜及其他代表則將於下過杪乘機赴法。</p>
<h3>柏林封鎖逾十閱月　陸上交通今開放　英區第一列車準備出發</h3>
<p>「聯合社柏林十一日電」柏林封鎖一度幾乎釀成東西職爭，今夜將和平結束。柏林時問午夜零時一分，通西德之陸路交通將重行開放。此乃蘇聯封鎖柏林之第三百二十七日，亦為英美空運以打破封鎖之第三百二十日。</p>
<p>蘇聯之封鎖與西方之反封鎖雖成尾聲，但蘇聯與西方盟國對德國問題之爭執仿將繼續，第二爭執階段將在五月廿三日巴黎四外長會議中展開。</p>
<p>〔聯合社法籣克福十一日是〕柏林封鎖解除徒第一列車中之五節，今日清晨自此間開往柏林，預定午後可到英軍區邊界里爾姆斯特，接上英軍列車。此一英軍列車預定明晨開過界綫，中途如無阻碍，明晨六時牛（柏林時間）可到柏林。車上載英美區交通處長殷格利斯等英美官員及新聞記者等約一百人。</p>
<p>三色國旗迎風招展</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十日電〕西柏林市長路特今日命紅黑兩色加金條西德國旗，遍懸柏林市內·電車·與公共汽車，開往西德漢諾威·漢堡與法籣克福等城之公共汽車亦將懸掛此種旗幟。柏林封鎖解除第一日，將有運煤火車十列及載運新鮮　薯與消費品之火車六列開入柏林。以後每日接濟柏林十二萬噸，與空運最高數量相同。</p>
<p>西區商店紛紛削碼</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林十日電〕柏林人民　信賡續十閱月的封鎖，可望順利解除，一切技衛上的歧見，均不難在封鎖解除前獲得解決。今日西區出售衣料及奢侈品之商店，已紛紛削碼十分之一以上。蘇區經濟委會，預料今後可自西德獲得大量輸入，故已宣布撇銷若干種衣料·瓷器·腳踏車胎·傢具等的定量配給。美督克萊表示，東西貿易恢復後，蘇聯將不致直接蒙受馬歇爾援助的利益，貿易概以物物交換為原則，故東歐或可間接獲得若干美援物資。</p>
<h3>西柏林將宣布　市政新計劃</h3>
<p>拒與東區當局妥協</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林十日電〕西柏林市議會主席索爾今日聲稱，柏林封鎖解除以後，西柏林市當局仍將拒絕與東柏林當局討論任何題目，不然即將業於承認「此一非法機構」。除非東柏林市議會無條件辭職，柏林泱不能重趨統一。索氏又稱，西柏林市議會於十二日上午九時開會時，英督羅勃森·美督克萊·法副督諾亞萊亦將列席，屆時將由市長路特宣布封鎖解除後的市政計劃。</p>
<h3>向德人民話別　克萊語重心長</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十一日電〕德境美軍總督克萊即將退休返國，今日向德境美英合併區經委會話別，據稱，美國希望德國統一，抵要各佔區同樣保嶂波恩憲法所包括之自由。德人應致力三大工作：（一）認識盲由（二）立志永不放棄自由；（三）適當運用自由。克萊此種言論，典德境英軍總督羅勃森，前此之聲明相一致，羅氏曾謂西方國家決不在巴黎外長會議中，出賣基本民主的權利。</p>
<h3>西德新憲法　可獲盟國批准</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏秣十日電〕據英軍政府發言人宣布，三強總督將於十二日下午在法蘭克福開會，以便批准西德憲法。盟國官員相信三督將於十二日或十三日在法蘭克福簽准該憲法。</p>
<h3>西德決建都波恩　貝多芬誕生地風景幽美</h3>
<p>〔路透社西德波恩城十日電〕西德制憲議會業於下日晚，以　三票之多數，通過以萊茵河岸風景出勝之波恩城為德國聯邦共和國之首都。表決時贊成定法鬧克福為首都者廿九票，兩共黨議員均棄權。按波恩為大音樂家貝多芬之故鄉，為著名的大學城及學術中心。一九四四年大轟炸時，大學及圖書館泰半被毀，貝多芬之故居及貝多芬博物院幸告無恙。</p>
<p>〔合眾祇波恩十日電〕制憲議會又以卅六對廿八票通過西德政權選舉法案二讀。該案規定凡曾為納粹黨員者，不得當選為國會議員或共和國總統。又規定下院議員為四百人，內半數以大多數之基礎選出，其餘半數依照比例派出。</p>
<h3>東西經濟制度儘可並存　三強有合作可能　莫斯科電台用英語廣播</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十日電〕莫斯科電台報告員瓦維洛夫今日用英語廣播稱，美蘇兩國經濟制度之合作，既蜀司能而且需要。此種廣播在四外長會議恢複前兩星期發表，尤引人重視。瓦氏稱，「反希特勒同盟蘇美英三大國巳向世界各國昭示不同之經濟制度，曾在二次世界大戰期問合作極有成績。兩種不同之經濟制度既能在職時合作，在和平時代自必更能合作。為維持持入和平計，此種合作匪特可能，且屬需要。」</p>
<h3>奧和約談判　延會至下月再開</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕廣續三閱月之四強外長代表奧國和約會議，己於今日在此宣告延會。開會雖已三月，對於和約中之各基本問題，仍未獲得解決。僵局打破的唯一希望，今僅在於巴黎外長會議後，得使蘇聯與西方國家的關係趨於好轉。和約討論始於一九四七年七月，其後屬延屢開，至三月前開始本屆會識，終因東西關係暗礁重重，仍未有重大結果。玆約下屆會議已決定至遲於六月廿五日舉行。巴黎外長會議是否將討論奧國問題，現尚不知，英國則認奧國問題亦不妨在巴黎會議中一談，惟須先由各外長處理德國間題。故料除非德國間題獲得解決，奧國和約中之諸棘手問題，尚難有解決之望。</p>
<h3>法內閣核准大西洋公約</h3>
<p>附保留條件批准兩德憲法</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十一日廣播：巴黎訊，法內閣無條件批准大西洋公約及建議中之歐洲議會。內關於舉行三小時會義後，發表公報稱：該兩案即將　呈歐禮和總統批准，然後提交國民議會以待辯論。此外內閣復批准西德憲法，附有若干保留。</p>
<h3>潘迪特夫人　訪晤艾契遜</h3>
<p>商治呈遞國書問題</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十日電〕新任印度駐美大使潘迪特夫人，今日與國務卿艾契遜作簡短談話，討論呈　國書問題後，即招待記者稱：印度目下並不懼怕中共軍隊侵入之可能。大使繼謂，印度在一九五○年時，其食物即足以自給，糧食問題，目下仍為最迫切之問題，但伊對將來具有信心。</p>
<h3>西德國基本法律　保障人權防止再侵略　呼召全國統一奠定和平基礎</h3>
<p>〔聯合社波恩十日電〕德意志聯邦新憲法一百四十六條，在世界各國憲法史上獨樹一幟。其最有憲義之條文，規定禁止侵略戰，而以國家主權移屬將來之歐洲聯邦，尤屬創舉。其人權一章承認「人的尊嚴不可侵略……」。一切郵電檢查，新聞檢查，書報雜誌檢查概在禁止之列。新憲法一面使德人遵守國際公法，一面給以更大之自由，此種自由即在新特勒之前，德人亦未享受過。</p>
<p>任何野心家「以武力或企圖以武力」變更憲法，或篡奪國家元首之職權而自成為獨裁者，須受終身監禁之處分。德國政界領袖譽此憲法為「舉世最前進之憲章」。</p>
<p>其次，憲法條文一再呼召全國統一，聲明西德國僅屬暫時性質，足見其並不歡正式使東西兩部永久分裂。其序文稱，「德國人民深知其對於上帝對放人類之責任，決心保特其民族及政治之統一，在歐洲聯邦中以平等地位貢獻於世界和平，茲本其制憲職權，制定此德意志聯邦共和國之基本大法，俾為過渡時期之政治生活賦以新秩序。太議會之所為，且係代表其他德國人民（指東德），他們的參加並未加以拒絕。德意志全體人民現須以自由自決，完成德國之自由及統一」。憲法規定疆域一條亦用「暫時」字樣。</p>
<p>彼恩憲法為著重和平起見，未規定編練陸軍或宣戰權，並聲明任何德人不得「違反其良心」，被徵服兵役。其禁止侵略戰或準備侵賂戰一條稱：「任何行為凡擾亂或意圖擾亂各國和平關係者，尤其是準備侵略戰者，實屬違反憲法，應受懲處」。德國安全須賴國際集體保護，其主權規定移屬「國際機構」如歐洲聯邦之類。為維議和平計，德國聯邦得參加「互助的集體安全組織」。</p>
<p>關於人權一章，新憲法規定：（一）各人在法律之前，一列平等。（二）出版自由及以無綫電與電影報導自由應受保障，不得檢查。（三）全體德國人民，無須事前通知或獲得許可，得從事和平無武裝之集會。（四）住宅不可侵犯。（五）任何人不得因性別，血統，種族，文字，信仰或政治思想而受歧視或取得特權」。（六）「各邦職權係人民所賦予，應由人民以立法，行政及司法機關執行之。」。</p>
<p>憲法聲明人民可「自由組成」各種政黨，惟亦奠定禁止共產黨或任何軍國主義派活動之張本，規定各政黨必須根據「民主原則」如企圖危害「自由民主基本秩序」者，或危害聯邦存在者，均屬違反憲法。</p>
<h3>英聯邦會議各項決議　將交印議會通過　尼赫魯在新德里對全國廣播</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里十日電〕印度總理尼赫魯今夜在此向印度全國廣播，對印英間宿仇之解決表示滿意，調：「印度與英國間之衝突能以友善之方式解決，實為一良好之預兆」。總理謂：「余在倫敦出席聊邦總理會購後，於三日前抵此，今向各位報告此會議中所獲歷史性之決定，此項決定，將交予印度議會通過，且將經全印大會黨理事會討論。余與其他各位上月內在倫敦所完成之工作，將由此兩個偉大機構作最後評定」。</p>
<p>印對外政策與各國友好</p>
<p>尼氏認為絕大多數人民皆歡迎此決議，彼謂：「余已屢次宣佈，吾人之對外政策為努力求和平。且與一切國家獲得友好關係，而避免加入政治集團，此仍為吾人政策之準繩，吾人於頗久前，即發誓完成印度之完全獨立，此點今已完成，但印度與聯邦中其他各邦聯合並不因此喪失其獨立，蓋此項聯合，完全自由，絕無任何義務也。吾人需知，聯邦並無超然國家之意義，吾人已同意將英王視為此自由聯合之象徵首長，但英王對聯邦之地位並無任何職權，英王在印度憲法中，並無任何地位，故吾人不必向其效忠，余在作此決議時，當然顧及印度之利益，蓋此為余之第一個責任，但余一向認為最大之責任，為全世界之福利，此為聖雄甘地所予吾人之教訓。聖雄亦教導吾人在維持印度自由及尊嚴之原則下，追求和平之道，且與其他各國友善，世界今日充滿戰鬥，大災已在醞釀中，人類心中之仇恨恐懼與猜疑，已膜蔽彼等之視覺，因此吾人對任何足以減少世界摩擦之行動無不表示歡迎。</p>
<p>印度將成為東西間橋樑</p>
<p>余深知聯邦之若干部份中有不少使吾人極不滿之情形，為吾人昔日獨鬥之目標，但對於此種情形，吾人將以獨立自主國家之地位處理之，不能將不相關之事，混為一談。印度將努力成為作戰雙方問之橋樑，協助維持今日及今後最亟需之物，即世界之和平，余之同意倫敦協議，即因深信印度可因此更能推行其鼓勵和平自由，減少仇恨摩擦之政策，吾人不應在此世界緊急關頭耗廢時間於空言辯論，應集中力量於今日最迫切之工作，使印度能成一偉大強盛之國家，在亞洲及全世界盡其利人之責任。</p>
<h3>挪陸軍演習</h3>
<p>〔路透社奧斯陸十日電〕挪威陸軍官今日起在挪威東南部，舉行戰爭以來最大規模的演習，由陸軍總司令孟斯丹將軍主持。參加者參謀部暨各地高級軍官六十人，包括各聯隊司令在內。演習目標在研究防務條件，及東南區以及奧斯陸週圍的備戰狀態。</p>
<h3>美參院領袖主張　對西班牙復交</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十日電〕參院外委會主席康納利，今日放參院討論西班牙問題時，表示渠覺並無理由，何以不應使美國派遣大使一名駐在瑪德里。渠亦認國務院係受外國之壓力，而不能完全承認弗朗哥政權。康氏強調渠認美國一方面與蘇聯維持外交關係，一方面則拒絕與西班牙保持外交關係，殊覺欠缺理由。須知美國之派大使駐在他國，係為代表美國而非代表其他外國政府。共和黨參講員勃魯斯特亦認美國不派大使駐瑪德里，係受英法壓力所致。民主黨參議員麥卡倫認為西班牙亦應被列入大西洋公約，因為「一切信仰上帝愛好目由」的民主國家，均願意西班牙參加反共陣綫。</p>
<h3>愛要求交還北部　抗議英阻碍統一</h3>
<p>〔路透社白林十日電〕愛爾蘭國會今日一致通過柯斯合洛總理動議之決議案，要求英國結束北愛爾蘭「目前的佔領狀態」。該案對英政府之向下院提出愛爾蘭法案，其中保證北愛的現狀，表示憤怒的抗議。指其目的在批准並廣續愛爾蘭的分裂。該案要求英政府「結束北愛六郡的佔領狀態，使愛爾蘭的統一得以恢復，兩國間長久的糾紛為之解決。反對黨領袖前總理凡勒拉亦對柯斯台洛之動議表示支持。</p>

<h3>吉田籲請世界　改變對日看法</h3>
<p>〔合眾社東京十一日電〕吉田首相十一日籲請世界緩和對日觀念，並要求給予日機會，俾日本「在和平世界中公平競爭」而自給自足。吉田在東京記者協會向外籍記者演說時，提出此一戲劇性呼籲。渠要求現在渠領導下之新日本受不同角度之判斷，勿以對於昔在軍閥控制下侵略性日本之角度加以判斷。吉田對麥克阿瑟元帥頗加讚頌，調麥帥「在促使吾人走向復興之路方面，有無限貢獻。」</p>
<h3>蘇兵侵入伊朗　發生槍擊事件</h3>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭十一日電〕裏海岸阿斯泰拉港傳來未證實的報告稱，上週末蘇聯哨兵侵入伊朗國界，兩國哨兵曾開槍亙射，結果有伊兵一名失踪，數名受傷。蘇兵先越界侵入伊期，向伊朗邊防哨站發槍，伊防軍在土著協助下發槍還擊。蘇兵旋退入蘇界，但次日又增援再度侵入伊界。該報告並曰德黑蘭方面對此事極易重視，現兩國政府正在調查及研究。</p>
<h3>新聞公約草案　聯大社委會通過</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十日電〕聯大社會委員會今夜通過全世界第一次國際新聞傳　與更正權之草約。表決票數為廿七對四票，另十二票棄權。蘇聯，烏克蘭，白俄羅斯與南斯拉夫均投反對票。蘇代表柯諾夫指草約「完全為報業鑿斷家謀利，並不保護小國」。草約須交由聯大全體會議通過，全文廿三章，外加序言一章，某要旨在保障訪員採訪新聞及新聞發往國外時不受歧視。關於更正權一項，當事國政府担保接受他國政府要求，向原來之報紙或通訊社發出更正，但或該報或通訊社不受發布更正之法理約束。又規定和平時代取消新聞檢查，僅有關國防之消息例外。</p>
<h3>彭契為黑人呼籲　請美人公平處置</h3>
<p>渠出任聯合國託管組主任</p>
<p>〔合眾祇紐約十日電〕退休中之巴勒斯坦調解員彭契博士，出任聯合國託管組主任，渠警告稱：美國黑人問題「　較巴動斯坦問題更複離與扼腕。」彭氏於九日晚應美國聯合國協會之歡宴，曾演說稱：「余身為美人及黑人，不得不提醒美國同胞，吾人凡具有正義及公平處置者，均應致力於吾人國內一項問題之解決，如果吾人自己偉大國家欲完全躬行聯合國所有會員國所神聖保證之憲章原則。此項問題或較巴勒斯坦問題更為複雜與扼腕。」</p>
<h3>英蘇貿易協定　談判將告結束</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十日電〕消息靈通人士稱，英蘇雙方會商之短期貿易協定，不久即將給束，但此事尚未獲官方證實。同一人士謂，英商會會長哈洛威爾遜將於六月初應蘇政府之邀前往莫斯科，與蘇方會商貿易協定。但商會方面人土對此事拒絕加以證實，僅謂：「被等對威爾遜目加拿大返此從之計劃並無所知。」</p>
<h3>東德人民議會　將辦理選舉</h3>
<p>〔英國新開處倫數十一日電〕德境蘇佔區與柏林蘇佔區將於本月十五十六兩日，舉行新人民議會選舉。該人民議會將審查及通過「德國民主共和國」憲法草案，該草案係由人民理事會所擬訂，並於三月十九日經該會通過。該憲法中並無防止一黨專政之　制與平衡制度，已為非共產之德國報紙嚴加指責。人民誶會及人民理事會之整個組織，表面上雖代表各黨各派及全體德國人民，然全為蘇區共黨分子及其黨羽所操縱，並朱為多數人民所擁護。去年　夏季節，該組織會擬舉行全民投票，當時美軍佔區未准人民簽名，英佔區中雖　准許，然支持者寥寥。</p>
<h3>俟中東局勢安定　英即廢軍火禁令</h3>

<h3>聯大特別政治委會決議　展緩討論荷印問題　擱至秋季大會時再行提出商討</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十日電〕聯大特別政治委員會今日決定以印荷爭執問題擱至秋季大會討論。表決票數為四十二對六，僅蘇聯集團投反對票，另六國棄權。提議者為印度與澳洲，理由為印荷已在巴達維亞成立協定，聯大於此際加以辯論，有損無益。先是蘇聯代表馬立克曾與委員會主席即菲代表羅慕洛發生舌戰。馬氏稱，關於印荷新協定，印尼代表並無所知，印澳之提議完全聽信荷蘭一面之辭，巴達維亞之談判乃囚犯與獄官之談判。政治委員會理應准許印尼代表巴拉爾陳述意見。羅氏答稱：蘇聯之提議碍難接受，印澳提案賓際乃延期討論之提案，依照聯大規定，此類提案乃手續間題必須優先討諭。且印尼代表巴拉爾此際不欲發言。馬氏稱，此點證明該代表之被剝奪發言權，因印尼共和國領袖在逃亡於邦加島。吾人不得不承認凡此均為荷蘭政府之計謀。羅氏勸馬氏發言勿越出本題，馬氏反議稱；「主席欲禁止余發言，余當照辦。」羅氏答稱：「貴代表有權發言，只要不越手續問題　閣，勿觸及印荷爭執之實質問題。「印度代表希伐勞稱：印度無意取悅任何外國，討論印尼問題之東南亞洲十九國會議即為印度召開，吾人並不要求取消此項問題，僅要求延至秋季大會討論。巴基斯坦代表柴夫魯拉稱：巴基斯坦將擁護印澳提案。</p>

<h3>甲組乒乓球聯賽　聯星今晚戰中行</h3>
<p>前賽綢白綢紅各演傑作</p>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽，今日（十二日）續有甲組一場，乙組三場，甲組由聯星對中行，聯星為上屆季軍，本屆操練殊勸，具有奪標雄心，麾下如胡一萍，吳祚昌，張善達，馮浩等健將，聲譽雖次於精武華美兩強，但各人球藝，攻守兼長，較任何隊為平均，中行遇此一支勁旅，自難取勝，若能全力上陣，不折不撓，必可使對方不敢生輕敵之心。</p>
<p>乙組三塲均攸關前程，將各有緊張鏡頭演出，乙一部郵思及乙二部聯合，前者六勝一負，後老四戰四勝，今分與勁敵海光及祟本較量，恐將遭過危運，另乙一部凌霞對凌隊，前者為上屆丙組亞軍，但已為「黑馬」善保所挫，後者乃談部種子，惜乎已遭新軍紅白毒手，兩隊各敗一次，此役咸不能再失，勝者尚有一綫生機，敗者希望斷絕，一塲惡鬥，自屬不免，茲探錄今日秩序如下：</p>
<p>聯星—中行（甲組）六時精分</p>
<p>海光—郵思（乙一）七時郵思</p>
<p>崇本—聯合（乙二）七時聯合</p>
<p>淩雲—淩隊（乙一）六時國貨</p>
<p>前日甲組中行出戰綢白於後者球室，中行人馬不齋，焉得不敗，王紹曾，朱國楨兩將力抗綢白楊昌熙昌嘉昆仲，戰況異常劇烈，最後力竭木支，連失兩關。第三組中行竺永康以直落二戰勝孔漢臣奪回一城，四五兩組中行以預備員出陣，遂非綢白所敵，先後敗退，結果綢白以四對一擊潰中行。乙組各場中，以乙三部種子新星演出失常，健將高尚志　運高照，以一對二失利，斷送勝利之果，綢紅得此意外收穫精神百倍，新人吳蠶鵬福至心靈，以直落二氣走對方李葆炎，結果綢紅以三對二告捷，新屋再受創傷，已失入選希望，殊屬可惜。茲探錄兩塲職績及前賽結果如下：</p>

<h3>許聞天叛國案共犯　陳惕盧等五人槍決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市警局昨午四時在閘北宋公園路刑場槍決通敵叛國犯陳惕盧，張達生，方志晨，朱大同，五文宗等五人，由常熟警分局副分局長李雅龍担任監刑官。按此五犯均屬於許聞天等所組織之「孫文主義革命同盟」中重要人物，專事煽動國軍叛變，企圖策應共軍渡江工作。若過去禾預幹團賈亦斌率隊出走，九十七師王昌彥部，江陰要塞司令戴戎光部，駐荻港之八十八軍等部之叛變，均係受該機構之煽動。此五人中多係國民黨黨員，當局以渠等　竊美名，組織非法團體，出賣黨國，危害民族生存，甘心投共，罪大惡極，乃呈準湯總司令判處死刑。據警局發表：</p>
<p>陳惕盧</p>
<p>年五十歲，不蘇淮陰人，南京文風書局，曾歷任貴州省黨部執行委員主任委員，山東省黨部執委，中央組織部戰地黨務處處長，浙江省府委員，蘇浙兩小訓練團教育長。於上年十一月間與高宗禹·許聞天·劉不同·諶小岺等發起組織「孫文主義革命同盟」，并任該偽總盟常委兼組織部長，復兼上海支盟負責人。「孫盟」組織綱領即由其主稿，并曾參加李濟琛之偽「國民黨革新委員會」，曾主使嚴一民策反我警備總部高參陳祖敏，（陳深明大義為所動），委派張達生過江與匪方聯絡，企圖分化政府實力，策應共匪渡江，叛黨禍國，誣蔑領袖，已於其偵訊筆錄及其自白書中供述不諱。</p>
<p>張達生</p>
<p>又名志仁，四十一歲，江蘇蕭縣人，中國文化服務社江蘇分社社長，曾任魯·蘇·豫邊區總部第十八縱隊副司令。上年冬由陳惕盧關係加入「孫盟」，担任該盟委員兼江蘇支盟書記，并曾奉陳惕盧之命，去蘇北淮陰與匪方聯絡，由所獲該支盟卅八年二月廿八日政治報告決議案—當前的政治形勢和我們的策略路綫—內容觀察，該犯誣蔑領袖，攻擊本黨，響應共匪，顛覆政府之陰謀，暴露無遺。并均在其口供筆錄自白書中承認不諱。</p>
<p>方志農</p>
<p>年卅五歲，安徽縣人，南京安徽中學教員。本年二月初由許聞天介紹加入「孫盟」，担任總盟秘書，供認參與「孫盟」叛黨禍國行為不諱。</p>
<p>朱大同</p>
<p>又名公陶，年四十二歲，江蘇蕭縣人，曾任蕭縣縣長，現任下蜀車站開源煤礦公司職員。本年二月底由張達生介紹加入「孫盟」蘇省支盟。據供曾出席該支盟無錫鎮江兩次會議，担任兵運不諱。經核對由馬涉文處搜獲之「開立」「公陶」兩人具名。致匪揚州市長桂樹人函件筆跡，即出自該犯手筆。勾結共匪，圖謀不軌係屬無疑。</p>

<h3>銀牛改業單帮　携銀元赴外埠拋出　帶豬肉等來滬銷售</h3>

<h3>台灣的金融業</h3>
<p>〔台北三日航訊〕台灣金融業最初僅有買辦性質的媽振館，日本統治台灣的當年（一八九五）日本中立銀行在台設立分行，可說是台灣最早的銀行，後該行與日本三十四銀行合併改稱爲卅四銀行，民國廿二年又與山口鴻地兩銀行合併，改稱三和銀行。這尙是純粹的日本銀行，一八九九年在台灣具有「中央銀行」任務的台灣銀行籌備設立，此後更有專辦儲備的台灣儲蓄銀行，地方性質的彰化銀行，商業性質的商工銀行，及勸業銀行，負有侵略使命的華南銀行，及合作性質的產業金庫等相繼設立。光復後，經政府改組合併，遂成現有的各銀行，其狀况如下：</p>
<p>台灣銀行</p>
<p>該行是台灣金融的中樞，光復後係接受日本三和銀行，舊台灣銀行，舊台灣儲蓄銀行，合併改組而成，於民國卅五年正式開業，資本總額爲台幣六千萬元，由國庫撥給，除經營一般銀行業務外，特准在規定數額內發行台幣，倂受政府之委託，辦理公債之募集，付息及還本事項，代理各級公庫以及政府其他委託事項，且得受中央，中國，交通，農民四銀行之委託代辦各項業務。　　該行總行設於台北，省內外分支機構達念七萬，業務分存款，放款匯兌，發行，信託，儲蓄等，截至卅七年年底止該行存款總額已達三〇〇，八〇八，三四二千圓，較該行三十五年存款已增加至七，二一九千圓同時期放款總額爲三四五，一六七，一八七千圓，大都皆用之於農工礦生產事業，及肥料水利放款，匯兌業務中省外匯兌係該行特權之一，但目前爲避避內地物價影響台灣，凡省外匯入之匯款已暫時停止，軍工匯款，須要省政府之核定台幣對金圓劵之匯率之調整爲台灣對內地各省物價之「防疫堤」，過去確曾有不少功效，但目前已逐漸失去效用，兩月之內匯率雖由三七〇三，調整到一六三，可是台灣物價本身仍是狂漲不已，根據物價指數的比較，「八一九」時期上海的物價三十六年底上漲了四十三倍，而同時台北物價僅上漲一倍半還不到，但到去年年底，上海物價較三十六年底上漲了一百廿倍，可是台北物價也上漲了十二倍多，可見台灣幣匯率的調整，已逐漸失其效用了，台幣發行額由光復至三十五年年底，僅爲五，三三〇，五九三千圓，至卅六年年底已至一四，八一九，九一二千圓，到卅七年底則已增至八九，〇八五，七二五千圓，其中本票發行尙不在內。現在當局在竭力收縮通貨，並加緊增產，以免台幣發生惡性通貨膨脹的惡果。</p>
<p>台灣土地銀行</p>
<p>台省光復之初，政府爲適應實際需要，並實現銀行專業化起見，乃於卅五年設立該行，並接收日本勸業銀行所有在台北，台南，台中，高雄，新竹等五地分行，分別改組就原地設立分行，資本總額爲台幣六千萬元由國庫一次撥給，總行設於台北，該行主要任務一爲調劑土地金融，使土地資本金化，俾固定之土地房屋可以獲得必需之流動資金，以期土地均能充分利用，尤其側重農村方面，以協助政府推行土地政策。一爲發展農林事業，以農貸或投資方式，直接輔助農林漁牧生產事業之發展。</p>
<p>台灣工商銀行</p>
<p>該行在日治時代，原名爲台灣商工銀行光復後監理改組爲台灣工銀行，資本額增爲台幣一千六百萬圓，分爲三十二萬股，官商合辦，由政府認股一八萬零六百零一股，馀爲民股，該行業務除極力吸收游資，並對中小工商業供給資金，同時並舉辦農業資金之貸放，故對地方商業，扶助甚多，該行總行設台北，省內共有分支行處廿七處。</p>
<p>維也納大學近訊</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國去年分批前赴維也納留學之各科學生，分別在維也納大學等處攻讀，頃據維也納大學工學院院長致函奧國駐華使館，謂：凡申請批准參與一九四八年七月卅一日冬季註册之十八生，近因出入境之種種困難，故允予延期至一九四九年三月一日（春季）或一九四九年冬季十月一日註册，除此之外，該校尙有可供廿五位華籍學生攻讀之學位，但無獎學金。</p>
<h3>大凉山恩仇記（下）</h3>
<p>「欲将先父靖邊武力據為己有」，這是孫仿的整個罪名，當此皇皇檄文散遍鄕野，且公然貼於西昌街頭之時，孫仿爲了自衛，當鄧德亮的一營由康定入援之時，在拖朗被孫仿吃掉，鄧德亮遂向西昌進軍，命長呼五角在寗東進攻羅木呷，瓦渣支在紅毛進攻那之打魚，以爲聲援，被攻的兩個夷人領袖，均是夷族觀光團團員，同時鄧德亮攻入沙場，抄擄了孫部官佐的家屬住宅，於是西昌情勢陡變，人心惶惑，謠言四起，瀘沽與西昌之電訊中斷，四荒蠻夷紛紛趁火打刧，賀國光乃於上月底匆匆自渝迨返西昌鎭懾，臨行前一日對記者說：「夷人做起戰來，非常野蠻，燒殺擄掠，無所不爲，我想盡力用和平手段來解決這個問題」。</p>
<p>賀國光回去已半月了，大凉山下未傳出一絲和平的信息，大槪是「鎭懾」不住，賀氏一怒商得劉文輝之同意，調劉部一三六師加入，用以對付鄧德亮，地方人士見勢不佳，一再提出請賀氏俯念鄧秀廷老司令治夷的勳績，寬恕遺孤，四月二日賀氏答應以三天爲鄧德亮幡然悔悟的機會。</p>
<p>西康旅渝同鄕代電</p>
<p>然而迄今三日，結果如何，音訊杳然，西康旅渝同鄕會最先是電請賀國光將軍務必以和平手段解決這個問題，前天忽又代電呈請綏署將劉文輝撤職查辦，事情的演變眞是微妙已極，原電如下：</p>
<p>「西南長官公署鈞鑒：寗屬孫鄧之爭，本會以憫惜桑梓，曾電賀綏靖司令懇祈和平解決，以免地方糜爛，爲今息爭之計，似宜劃分孫鄧職責，共維地方治安以固後方，至於天蘆榮寳民變，據一般可信傳說：係康劉部屬子姪輩弁髦法令，一若過去榮經事件之重演，在一般士紳則對劉氏毒化西康深爲不滿，在人民則挺而走險，轉相聲應，釀成巨變。如欲毖後懲前，擬請將劉文輝撤職查辦，另簡公正大員，主持康政，以靖邊圉，安定後方。本會同仁念故里之昆季，懷仙人之廬墓，平心陳述，決無恩怨，謹電鑒察，西康省旅渝同鄕會（三十八）卯眞印」。</p>
<p>西康旅渝同鄕會負責人，這幾天經常出入於西南政務委員會秘書長張篤倫之門，希望張氏能够有助於寗屬地區的和平因爲張篤倫曾任西昌行轅主任，同時是鄧秀廷將軍的「親家」，（張墮機而死之子，娶鄧女爲媳）。半月前有人曾見張篤倫致函劉文輝，懇其退兵，當是希望一三六師勿對其親家母相逼，照今天「倒劉」之聲又起，看來危機四伏，局勢似乎越來越嚴重了。</p>
<p>抗建懇社搗毀</p>
<p>目前抗建懇社在雷馬屏邊區奪取「春烟」，引起漢夷之爭，夷人已將抗建懇社搗毀，墾民住宅被焚成墟，抗建懇社總經理呂鎭華被困於大河，夷民續向屏山縣進進逼，另一方面滇省東北部又已爲匪軍朱家豐輩控制，設若寗屬靖邊司令部內部紛爭不得合理解決，鎭夷的兵力反而成爲引導夷人倡亂的導火綫，稍一不愼，川康滇黔四省邊區整個變爲漢夷之爭，未開化的野夷乘機而出掠，這十幾萬野蠻夷民所造成的騷動，又在這塊「偏師頻覆沒，上將屢專征」的地區，縱或諸葛亮再世，恐亦非一二年功夫所能平定的了。</p>
<p>寫稿至此，傳來喜訊賀國光已有覆電致此間西康旅渝同鄕會，表示決以和平方式，解決這次紛爭，外戰內戰期久，始終未遭直接損害的西南同胞，無不殷望這幕活的是「大凉山恩仇記」是以喜訊收尾。</p>
<h3>烽火連天·狼烟匝地　天涯何處覓桃源　香港剳記</h3>
<p>〔香港三日訊〕烽火連天，狼烟匝地，只要是一個還有點生之慾望的人，誰不想找一個世外桃源，作一次「避秦」的好夢，不幸陶淵明已經死了千多年，人們雖然嚮往着一「桃源」，但那裏找到這麼一位「領港」呢？</p>
<p>倘若你覺得這塊地方眞適合你今天的身份，倘若你對於這裏的一切感覺滿意，那末你眞應該驕傲我們的祖宗有先見之明，一百年前就把這地方送給了大英帝國，替他的子孫留下了一個「桃源」。</p>
<p>但是，倘若你的血統中還有點中國人的血統，又倘若你也並不曾得了健忘症。把你的血統也忘記了，你來到這塊外國人統治的中國土地上，那你應該知道，你是一個僑民，那一切好的，美的，有如桃源一樣給了你幸福的，正是那些高鼻子，黃頭髮的外國人，有那麼一天，他甚麼時候高興就甚麼時候收還你這份你以為是好的美的幸福。</p>
<p>那麼你也許又有點覺得惘然了。</p>
<p>大槪你的運道很好，你到香港的那一天正是一個夜晚。</p>
<p>在海的盡頭，你看到好像懸在空中的密如繁星的萬盞明燈，燈光照射的綠色的海峽中，恍着，一如萬條金蛇，奔騰向你的脚下，迎接你這位遠來的貴客。</p>
<p>有甚麼比這樣的風色更美麗的呢，你歡呼了，你幻想着那岸上更美麗，更可愛的景色了。也許，你的那些親戚，或者你的愛人，正等着你去熱烈地擁抱。</p>
<p>你讀過相對論嗎？你的好運道後面，跟來的却是壞運道了。</p>
<p>船上的管理員向你的同行者，——全體旅客宣佈了：「今天不能登陸」！</p>
<p>「爲甚麼？」</p>
<p>「殖民地防疫處還沒有來檢查！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽不來？」</p>
<p>「過了辦公時間，下班了！」</p>
<p>「上海發了檢疫證，還要查甚麼？旣不信任上海，上海又發甚麼檢疫證？」你有點抱怨。</p>
<p>「這是英國的規定，我不知道！」管理員在執行「英國的法律」，也許，他也意味着自己已是一個「英國人」了，自然你是不會相信的，因爲他的鼻子不高，頭髮也不黄，特別是那對鼠眼，幾乎把他那點「英國人」的「派頭」也冲淡了。</p>
<p>那高聳入雲的洋樓，那平坦清潔的柏油馬路，那往來如梭而頗有秩序的過海渡輪，那絡繹不絕毫無在上海擁擠之象的雙層電車，那一招手卽來，漂亮，華麗，比私家車有過無不及的營業「巴士」，那華麗，平穩，價廉物美的「巴士」，以及那些雍容有緻帶些英國「尖頭鰻」風度的高等華人，這一切，將不是久居於上海，經歷了各種紛亂，紏　，窒息，恐怖的情形者所能想象。</p>
<p>然而，那也僅僅是香港的一面，你看到另一面嗎？也正如國內一樣，那華麗的高樓，那平坦的馬路，不是累積了千千萬萬苦人兒的血汗的嗎？一百八十萬人口中，有幾多人住了洋房？有幾多人住着比浦東那些草棚還簡陋的「木屋」？有幾多人連住一間木屋的資格也沒有？前幾天，有六個暴徒在最熱鬧的市中心區搶刧了一家錢兌店，槍傷事主三人，香港政府的懸賞緝拿暴徒賞格，一天之中變了三次，從一千加到五千，從五千加到一萬。但這也僅僅爲了事情發生於鬧市而已，在比較僻靜的地方那一天沒有這樣刧案呢？如果你去訪問一個略爲有點「辦法」的朋友，看門人從一個不到五寸見方的小洞裏接過你的名片，半天，半天，才打開門來，請你進去。那你就會意味到這塊桃源樂土上，人們是怎樣在過着戰戰競競的生活，怎樣隨時隨地謹防着「不速之客」的入門。</p>
<p>你初到香港，當然會有點遊興，你不到香港存去吃點海鮮嗎？不知名的穿着各色各樣花紋衣服的魚，三四斤重的龍蝦，跟小臉盆差不多大的海蟹，還有，新鮮的鮑魚，新鮮的干貝，數不盡，識不完的海鮮，等着你去揀擇。你不到香港山頂去俯瞰一下港九全景嗎？英國海軍上將的旗艦，從山上望下去，跟你府上的小擺設有什麽不同？然而你得當心，巴士也罷，登山攬車也罷，他隨地可能碰到暴徒的光顧，使你乘興而去敗興而回。朋友，你會覺得這塊海外桃源，有時也會「寸步難行」的吧？</p>
<p>天涯何處覓桃源，你到香港四十八小時，也許會如此長嘆了。</p>
<h3>江南農村一瞥</h3>
<p>春花不好·秋收難期</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕去年限價開放的時候，適當秋收以後，米價陡高，許多米商拼命地向農村間以稍高的價格收購米糧，農胞近視於這目前金圓劵的誘惑，於是紛紛脫售，及至脫售以後，米價還是不斷的高漲，他們的米已經卽將賣完了，懊悔也已來不及了。現在農村中新的東派西攤的款項太多，而都以米作爲標凖的，農民們在無奈中反以高價購進米糧來償還這些應派應攤的款項。我曾問過一位杭州的大糧商，我說農村中到底現在存米還有多少？他說恐怕沒有什麽了。他的理由是在去年限價以後，農民見米價看好紛紛脫售，改兌金子，現在農村中需米，都以金子兌掉換取米糧。由於這位糧商的證明，我們至少可知道農村中實在沒有什麽存米</p>
<p>春花不好，秋收難期，農村中存米不多，我們如何來應付今年的難關。也卽是今年的空前饑荒！</p>
<h3>聯合國之鶯</h3>
<p>— 嚆矢</p>
<p>聯合國大會上最使出席代表們感到方便的，莫過於會場裏設置的「譯意風」了。假使沒有它，不知道要使這爲世界人類謀幸福的偉大的機構，將遭到多少時間上的損失，使這幾十個國家間增加多少精神上的隔閡，本來兩個民族或國家間，言語一不通，根本就無從談到互相瞭解，甚至於因此引起不必要的誤會，但在這裏，聯合國的科學家們，却輕易的爲我們解決了這個重要問題。</p>
<p>首先要解決的是語言問題，雖然全世界有成千種不同的語言，但普通應用在外交上的不過幾種，所以也無需盡量適應各地的方言。聯合會議席上起初用的僅有中·法·英·蘇·西班牙五種語言，其後由於設備的改進，又顧慮到歐洲幾個小國代表們發言的方便，除上面五種之外，又添了德·義兩種，這樣就差不多够用了。</p>
<p>它的設備，大致也可以分作兩個時期，最初僅僅能把上面說的五種語言譯成英語，再由揚聲器或聽筒傳達給各位代表，但來自世界各地的代表，英語的程度並不見得都好，自然很容易引起誤會，所以這種方式不久就廢棄不用了。</p>
<p>代之而起的是至今還在用着的別開生面的新型機件；在會場裏任何一位代表談話，這聲音立時會被設置在會場裏的「麥克風」收進去，再用綫路傳到會場邊一排玻璃臺子裏坐着的譯員小姐們的耳朶裏去，她們工作的效率委實驚人，她們每個人必須能懂七個國家的語言，同時毫不猶豫地流利地翻譯出來，演講者的演辭是連續不斷的，她們翻譯的詞句也是不斷的。非但如此，而且她們每個人都有幾分演講的天才，能把每個代表演詞的中心意識和語氣表現得非常恰切。每個參加過聯合國會議的人對這番本領無不佩服得五體投地。</p>
<p>這七個譯員的聲音分別傳進七隻麥克風裏再傳進七具放大器，最後變成電波，用七種不同的波長，從天棚上繞着的一個銅綫上放射出來。</p>
<p>收訊機更簡單，比我們普通用的照相機還要小些，裏面裝着全副的收訊設備和電池，附着一根帶子，這就是天綫，不需要連接在什麽地方，代表們儘可以拿着它一面走一面聽。上面還有隻旋鈕，無論那一國代表起來演講，聽的人只需把它的指針旋到自己能聽的懂的語言上就足夠了。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律釋疑　退田時未立筆據　轉租耕地迭起糾紛</h3>
<p>（姜屏藩律師主答）</p>
<p>黃仲毅君問：某甲有祖遺田七畝，民廿六年間因乏人耕種，且尙欠租二熟未還，故將該田退還田主。奈該田主一時糊塗，不命其出立退田票，隨卽委託某乙續種。一年後，乙因該田不良，不願再種。田主乃另委丙某耕種，出有種田票。丙自廿八年期租種迄今已有十一年之久。最近甲忽對丙提出田面權，並迫使停種。請問：</p>
<p>（一）丙與甲，於田面上，是否尙有關係？（二）因退租及欠租關係，甲是否尙有田面權？（三）退租時，未立筆據是否有效？（四）現在甲問丙收還田面，丙應如何處置？（五）歷時十一年之久，甲並無意思表示，於初租種時亦無片言，今丙能否率直拒絕之？（六）迫使停種，有無理由可以聲駁？</p>
<p>「答案」（一）（二）丙向田主租地耕種，旣有田票，並已耕種達十一年之久，當已取得租地權利。甲與田主，旣已退租，自無何種權利可言，不能以田主未將田票收回主張權利。（三）退租時，不必立筆據，有十一年甲未耕種之事實，可以證明。（四）甲向丙收還田面，丙可憑藉田主所出田票，以資對抗加以拒絕。（五）丙可直率拒絕甲之請求。（六）如果甲迫使停種，可控以妨害自由罪。</p>

<h3>Minor Skirmishes on the Kunshan-Taicang Front, Confused Fighting in the Suburbs of Jiashan, Fierce Fighting South of Chong'an in Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] According to a military communique released at 9:30 PM on May 11th:</p>
<p>(1) On the Kunshan-Taicang front, there have only been sporadic battles in recent days, with our troops achieving considerable gains. In the area west of the Kunshan railway, small groups of bandits harassed us at noon on the 11th, but were repelled by our champion troops. Our troops, remaining behind enemy lines, are gradually growing and becoming more active with the assistance of local civilians, posing a significant threat to the enemy's rear.</p>
<p>(2) The bandits advancing towards Jiashan are still engaged in confused fighting with our troops in the suburbs. Another force of over two thousand is circling around to attack Fengjing Town, and we have dispatched troops to suppress them.</p>
<p>(3) Transportation on the Songjiang-Jinshan route is smooth, and the market is peaceful. The troops stationed there and the residents all share a determination to fight the bandits to the end. If the bandits dare to invade, they will surely suffer a crushing defeat.</p>
<p>(4) A portion of the bandits and local communists from Haiyan, numbering about 400, attempted to attack Mojia Village this morning. Our defending troops launched a head-on attack, killing or wounding over 50 bandits and capturing 5. The rest fled in disarray.</p>
<p>(5) About 500 to 600 local communists were discovered in the area 3-4 li south of Shangyu on the morning of the 11th. A certain unit of our army has dispatched troops to search and suppress them.</p>
<p>(6) A certain main force of the bandits, together with a battalion of artillery, fled south towards Chong'an (located at the border of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, within Fujian territory) last night. A certain unit of our army bravely engaged them, inflicting fierce and continuous attacks, killing or wounding over 400 bandits. The bandits then continued their fierce attack using superior artillery fire, resulting in intense fighting. Currently, our defending troops are strongly resisting in the area east and west of Xing'an, firmly holding their original positions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military news at 11:00 AM on May 11th:</p>
<p>(1) A certain main force of bandits harassing Jiaxing, under cover of artillery fire last night, launched a fierce attack on the northwestern suburbs of Jiashan. Our defending troops calmly responded to the attack, and the bandits' repeated attempts to charge were repelled. The battle was extremely fierce, continuing until dawn. Due to the destruction of communications lines, contact has been lost.</p>
<p>(2) Over 2,000 bandits infiltrated from Yingtan towards the Jinxi-Nancheng area yesterday morning (May 10th). A certain unit of our army is currently intercepting them.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, May 11th Dispatch] The Central News Agency's Shanghai dispatch on the 9th reported fierce fighting in Fengling, northern Fujian. However, according to local authorities here, that report is inaccurate. It is reported that on the 5th, Zhejiang bandits appeared to be heading south across the Xianxia Ridge, but under the close surveillance of the national army, they fled back on the 8th, and no fighting occurred. The situation in Fujian is currently peaceful, and local communists have little room for activity under the surveillance of the powerful national army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, May 11th Dispatch] Military News: (1) Communist activities have been detected at the Jiaoqiao bridge between Zhangshu and Linchuan. (2) In the Echang area, bandit activities have been detected in the Xujiabu and Liujiadu areas. The national army is closely monitoring the situation.

<h3>Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command Issues Seven Important Orders for Military Requisition and Establishes Military Discipline Investigation Teams to Inspect Various Locations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] In view of the recent frequency of military requisitions and the potential for disorder in inspection procedures, the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command, in order to rectify</p>
<p>discipline and maintain order in the region, has issued the following seven orders:</p>
<p>(1) The requisition of vehicles and ships shall be handled uniformly by the Shanghai Transportation Command. No units or agencies may requisition them without authorization.</p>
<p>(2) The requisition of housing shall be handled uniformly by the Adjutant's Office of this Command. No agencies or units may forcibly occupy them without authorization.</p>
<p>(3) When requisitioning civilian labor, each unit shall make an accurate estimate and report it to the headquarters of the military (independent division) to which it belongs for approval. The Political Warfare Department shall then notify the local administrative authorities to handle it impartially. It is strictly forbidden to allocate quotas directly to townships and villages or to force employment, and it is absolutely forbidden to allocate funds from the people.</p>
<p>(4) When requisitioning military supplies (such as steel, wood, etc.), if each unit truly needs them, it shall list the use and variety in detail and report it to this Command for approval. It is absolutely forbidden to demand or seal them off without authorization.</p>
<p>(5) The removal of barbed wire fences shall be handled by the military division headquarters with a letter of request and a receipt shall be provided. No units may dismantle and use them arbitrarily.</p>
<p>(6) Requisitioning from foreigners and Taoist properties is prohibited. In special circumstances, this Command may handle them according to legal procedures. No units may occupy or damage them without authorization.</p>
<p>(7) All water, land, and air sentry inspectors shall treat inbound and outbound personnel with courtesy, and the procedures shall be simple and expeditious. They shall not deliberately create difficulties or extort money.</p>
<p>It is understood that, in addition to issuing these orders to all subordinate units and relevant agencies for strict compliance, the Garrison Command will also publicize them to the public, effective immediately. At the same time, the Command has organized military discipline investigation teams to inspect various locations at any time. Those found to be in violation of the above orders will be punished severely according to the law.</p>
<h3>After a Crushing Defeat of the Communist Army in Jiaodong, Qingdao's Outskirts Return to Calm</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, May 11th Dispatch] The communist field army in Jiaodong suffered a crushing defeat and has been largely annihilated, with no capacity to attack again. Currently, the remnants of the bandits are retreating into Pingdu County to reorganize. The outskirts of Qingdao have returned to their former state of tranquility.</p>
<h3>"People's Government" Established in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to someone from Nanjing, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government has been formally announced. The mayor is Liu Bocheng, and the deputy mayors are Ke Qingshi and Zhang Linzhi.</p>
<h3>Fu Bingchang Lectures in Hong Kong on the Recent Situation in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, May 11th Dispatch] According to reports, Fu Bingchang, the Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union, gave a lecture at the University of Hong Kong on the 11th, reporting on the recent situation in the Soviet Union. He claimed that religious freedom in the Soviet Union is gradually being restored. The change in the Soviet Union's attitude towards religion is the result of Soviet military families praying for the safety of their expeditionary forces during the war. Divorce cases in the Soviet Union have also decreased compared to before the war, which is the effect of implementing new divorce laws. The purpose of these laws is to stabilize families, as many Soviets serving abroad are easily attracted to foreign women and want to divorce their wives back home.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants Disappointed in Trade with the Communist Areas</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, May 11th Dispatch] Steel, a Far East correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune, wrote an article from Seoul, which was published in the Jiji Shinpo here. The article stated: The foreign trade implemented by the Chinese Communists in Northeast and North China has set China back a hundred years. The strict and unreasonable control of trade and foreign exchange by the Chinese Communists has disappointed many foreign merchants, as they had expected the Chinese Communists to conduct fair trade. Most foreign trading firms in Tianjin and Beijing are pessimistic about future trade under the Chinese Communist regime. The Chinese Communists' interference in foreign trade is extremely bureaucratic and unreasonable, and the procedures are even more cumbersome than those of the Chinese government. Over 60% of foreign trade is monopolized by the North China Trade Bureau, so there is no room for activity for ordinary merchants. Large-scale private industries in North China, such as coal mines, are currently facing increasing operational difficulties due to labor problems and the Communist side's arbitrary interference in management and finance. Under Communist rule, there is no distinction between Chinese and foreign or Soviet and Anglo-American firms. However, the Chinese Communists are particularly harsh on American firms in North China, and their situation is very difficult. British banks in North China have been allowed to continue operating, but although half of foreign commerce and trade in North China belongs to the United States, American banks have been closed.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Weijun Meets with Acheson</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Washington, May 11th Broadcast: After meeting with Acheson for half an hour, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States told reporters: He had requested that Acheson consider the United States joining a Pacific regional treaty similar to the Atlantic Pact, in order to clearly demonstrate to the enemies of democracy that the United States is as concerned about the progress of communism in Asia as it is elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Continues to Strengthen its Defense Forces; Planes Fly to Hong Kong from Singapore Today; British Government Officials Believe the Chinese Communists Are Unlikely to Attack Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Manila, May 10th Dispatch] It has been officially announced here: A Royal Air Force squadron, consisting of fifteen land-based aircraft and one Sunderland flying boat, will arrive here on the 12th from Singapore, en route to Hong Kong for routine practice flights.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, May 11th Dispatch] Reliable sources report: British army units will soon begin regular patrols in the 350-square-mile area of Kowloon, opposite Hong Kong Island. The British Field Artillery Regiment and the Gurkha Infantry Battalion stationed there will also be reinforced.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Canberra, May 10th Dispatch] The Australian government recently stated that if Hong Kong were threatened and requested assistance, the Australian government would immediately give it attention. However, the same source said that Australia would not take the initiative on this issue. They pointed out that Prime Minister Chifley had said that Australia had not yet received any requests from Britain to reinforce Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, May 10th Dispatch] Well-informed sources claimed on the 10th that although the Chinese Communist troops are gradually approaching Hong Kong, the British government does not expect the Chinese Communists to launch any large-scale attack on Hong Kong. The British side acknowledges that the main danger to Hong Kong is the possibility of internal disturbances launched by "rebels," so precautionary measures have been taken to reinforce the British garrison in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>An official said, "There is no question that 6,000 British troops will continue to be stationed in Hong Kong. With reinforcements, the garrison is expected to defend the colony against any large-scale military attack, but we have no reason to expect Hong Kong to suffer a large-scale military attack." The official also said that there is currently no plan to evacuate women and children from Hong Kong, as was done when the Japanese army massed on the Hong Kong border in 1940.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirk, the former commander of the British Army Engineer Corps stationed in China before the war, recently criticized the British Cabinet's decision to reinforce Hong Kong, saying that a garrison of 6,000 in Hong Kong is "absolutely insufficient." The perimeter of Hong Kong Island alone is 25 miles, and the coastline of the leased territory opposite Hong Kong Island is 100 miles. Among the 6,000 British troops, each soldier must defend more than 1,000 yards of coastline against a potentially powerful communist army.</p>
<p>Regarding the naval perspective, Colonel Bell, who once served in China, said that the defense of Hong Kong is primarily a naval matter. Without aircraft carriers, effective defense is impossible. Without air support, the colony is bound to fall. Only aircraft carriers can provide air support. And if aircraft carriers are based in the Mediterranean, they will be of little use to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>It Is Not Too Late to Prevent the Chinese Communist Advance</h3>
<p>Zhou Yide Said in New York</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, May 11th Dispatch] Republican Congressman Zhou Yide said in a speech at a religious gathering on the night of the 11th that it is not too late for the United States to try to stop the advance of communism.</p>
<h3>The Garrison Troops Outside Hankou Launch an Attack, and Local Communists 20 Li Northeast of the City Are Repelled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, May 11th Dispatch] Military News: The garrison troops outside Hankou, in coordination with heavy artillery, launched attacks on Caidian, Zhangjiawan, Jimakou and other places, and were very successful. They are currently continuing their advance. Furthermore, in recent days, our Air Force has flown to Qijiawan, north of Hankou, to bomb the Communist troops, with excellent results.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, May 11th Dispatch] The Wuhan defense battle has entered its third day. From morning to night, the sound of artillery is loud and clear, and the citizens are quite panicked. Most of the shops in the city are closed, the streets are heavily guarded by police, and the number of pedestrians has decreased sharply, as no one knows where the sound of artillery is coming from. The sound of artillery gradually subsided at 8:00 PM. The reporter visited a senior military official, who said: There are 6,000 local Communists active more than 20 li northeast of Hankou. They were engaged by the national army, with the assistance of heavy artillery. The Communist army was unable to withstand the attack and was forced to retreat more than 2 li to the north. The national army is currently continuing its mop-up operation. Please tell the citizens that the artillery fire is coming from the national army's position and that there is no need to panic.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, May 11th Dispatch] May 11th was the third day of the Wuhan defense battle. Commander Lu Daoyuan specially ordered the Wuhan outer garrison to attack the bandits at Sandaoqiao, with the assistance of the Air Force. The battle was extremely fierce. From 2:00 PM onwards, the sound of artillery fire could be heard in Wuhan, and passersby rushed to flee. Shops closed one after another, and the city was in a desolate state. The reporter made a special trip to visit Huang Shengyuan, a spokesman for the Wuhan Garrison Command, who said: This battle was an active attack by our army, and the sound of artillery fire was fired by our side. The bandits at Sandaoqiao have collapsed towards Zhangkou. At the same time, another unit of our army attacked more than 2,000 bandits from Xiaji to Lijia岗 and Xujiawan, successively capturing Lijia岗 and Xujiawan and other places, killing more than 400 bandits, seizing 3 machine guns and more than 80 rifles. We lost a platoon leader and 57 soldiers. On the night of the 10th, our army conducted a mop-up operation near Cai Dian Banji in Hanyang, and the bandits have been forced to retreat. Our army is chasing after them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, May 10th Dispatch] Today is the third day of the Wuhan defense battle. There was artillery fire in Chenjiaji, Niejiang, and Fenghuo Mountain in the northern suburbs. The sound of artillery fire could be heard clearly in the city around 1:00 PM, but the general public remained calm.</p>
<h3>Reliable Sources in Guangzhou Report That Fu Zuoyi Has Committed Suicide After Attempting to Flee to National Army Area Without Success</h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, May 11th Dispatch] According to reliable sources today: Former North China military leader Fu Zuoyi committed suicide yesterday. Mr. Fu attempted to flee to the National Army area without success, and was forced to do so by Communist leaders. This is the result of months of disputes between Mr. Fu and the Communist military headquarters. The Communist authorities demanded that the troops of Mr. Fu be incorporated into the Communist army.</p>
<h3>The British Embassy Remains in Nanjing, and London's Public Opinion Criticizes "Throwing Dust Into Their Own Eyes"</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, May 10th Dispatch] "The Economist" magazine today published an article commenting on the situation in China, with the title "The Ambiguous Embassy in China." The article stated, "The Chinese Communists have re-demanded over the Beijing radio that British warships apologize for their violent actions and compensate for the losses. But under these favorable conditions, even if both sides in China may adopt a friendly diplomatic policy towards Britain, we will still consider it carefully. International law makes it impossible for us to quickly recognize a rebel party diplomatically while a government recognized by all countries still retains a large part of the country. Moreover, these two sides are not equally friendly. One side has a history of maintaining reasonable friendly relations with Western countries, while the other side has declared that it will be an ally of the Soviet Union in any war caused by the Atlantic Pact. It would be unwise to sacrifice a most dissatisfied friend and bestow the benefits of diplomatic recognition on the enemy. And some say that the British ambassador's stay in Nanjing is to conduct private contact with the Chinese Communists to obtain the release of the Amethyst. But having envoys with both sides at the same time does not solve the most important problem: which government has the right to use the foreign assets of the Chinese government? Which government has the right to appoint ambassadors to various countries, as well as representatives to the United Nations, representatives to the Allied Control Council in Tokyo, or Chinese consuls in various parts of Southeast Asia? We must add this power to one of the two parties. If the British ambassador to China consults with the Chinese Communist authorities, while at the same time sending a lower-level representative to Guangzhou, it is tantamount to placing the Chinese Communists in a higher position than the National Government. If this is the case, what attitude will the British government take when the Chinese Communists demand to send another ambassador to Britain, or use China's pound deposits in Britain? The American side's attempt to recall its ambassador is to avoid this dilemma. Just as they were able to avoid the losses suffered by the British Navy by withdrawing warships from the Yangtze River in advance, the American policy towards China is to 'wait until the dust settles,' while the British policy is to throw dust into their own eyes.</p>
<h3>Improvement of the Method of Issuing Meal Allowances for Students in Various Schools</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, May 11th Dispatch] Zhan Jiewu, spokesman for the Ministry of Education, recently told reporters about the situation of issuing meal allowances for students in various schools, saying: For students' meal allowances in various schools, all those approved on file are issued by the Ministry in accordance with the methods approved by the Executive Yuan. The standard is 2.3 dou of rice per student per month, and the payment is made according to the market price. The non-staple food cost is adjusted monthly according to the base number of 10 yuan multiplied by the cost of living index. This fund is advanced every month. For example, the student meal allowance for May will be advanced at the beginning of this month according to the number for last month, so that the schools can purchase grain in advance and will not be affected by the increase in rice prices. If the price of rice rises sharply in the middle of the month, additional advances will still be added successively. From May onwards, it is planned to uniformly change the staple and non-staple food costs to be calculated in customs gold units. This is being discussed with the Ministry of Budget and Finance. Zhan also said: The Ministry hopes that the principals of various schools will be responsible for supervising the students' meals, and after receiving the Ministry's payment, they will purchase grain for the entire month to avoid being affected by price fluctuations.</p>

<h3>The Arrival of 30,000 Japanese Troops in Guangzhou Is Pure Fabrication</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, May 11th Dispatch] Government spokesman Bao Jingan claimed: Today, a certain newspaper in Hong Kong reported that 30,000 Japanese troops had arrived in Guangzhou, which is completely fabricated. There are many citizens in Guangzhou. If 30,000 Japanese troops had arrived, it should have spread throughout the city. Why is it that no Guangzhou newspapers have this news, and the people of Guangzhou are not aware of this? The government, in fact, cannot completely hide such a large number of troops. This proves the absurdity of this news.</p>
<h3>Long Wenzhi Died in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Collapsed and Died on the Way to Visit Friends</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, May 11th Dispatch] Legislative Yuan member Long Wenzhi arrived in Guangzhou from Chongqing at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the 10th. After registering with the Legislative Yuan with fellow Legislative Yuan members Yin Jingfu and Chen Jianfu, he left the hotel by rickshaw to visit friends, collapsed on the way, and died. The Legislative Yuan, considering that Mr. Long was the chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Party Headquarters, invited members of the Central Organization Department and the Secretariat to consult on the aftermath on the morning of the 11th. It was decided to appoint Zheng Yanfen, Chen Kewen, Gu Zhengding, and Cheng Tianfang as members of the funeral committee, and to inform Mayor Yang Sen to notify Mr. Long's family to fly to Guangzhou as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Rice Shortage in Fuzhou Has Been Resolved</h3>

The price per stone has returned to the old price of one qian and two fen and five li half a month ago, lower than the city government's limit price of one qian and three fen. However, commodity prices have risen sharply in recent days due to the instability of people's minds. On the 11th, each Yuan Yang coin was worth 7.5 million, and the prices of various goods rose by 60%.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong to Adopt Silver Standard? Morse Denies It</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, May 11th Dispatch] Morse, manager of HSBC, said on the 11th that the claim in a certain Shanghai newspaper that Hong Kong might adopt the silver standard is pure fabrication. He also heard rumors of silver being shipped to South China, but no silver has come to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, May 11th Dispatch] The Ministry of Education recently sent telegrams to national universities and colleges in Guangdong, Guangzhou, Jiangxi, Fujian and other regions, stating that due to the recent instability of the situation, teaching in various universities and colleges should be intensified, and the end of the semester may be advanced as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Holds Gold Savings, Provincial Government Promulgates Measures to Stabilize Finance, Except for Bank of Taiwan, Issuance of Promissory Notes Is Prohibited</h3>

The conversion rate of silver dollars to gold shall be determined by the aforementioned representatives.</p>
<h3>Northwest Journey</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiangmei</p>
<p>On April 1st, I took a plane from Guangzhou to the Northwest.</p>
<p>Along the way, I passed through Chongqing, then Hanzhong, and entered Lanzhou. Then I went to Ningxia. After returning from Ningxia, I flew back to Lanzhou and then to Xining, Qinghai. The whole journey was thousands of miles, lasting a week. On the evening of the 8th, I returned to Guangzhou, where every household was lit with lights, already in the twilight hours.</p>
<p>This trip was very interesting, and I saw many places and people I had never seen before. If the South is delicate, then the Northwest is magnificent. The graceful women of the South sing "Willows on the bank, a fading moon in the dawn breeze." The North is like a towering man singing "The great river flows eastward."</p>
<p>Chongqing:</p>
<p>Three thousand miles of the Jialing Shu Road,</p>
<p>Everywhere cold mountains, the thrush cries.</p>
<p>In the mountain city of March, spring is almost over. It happened to be a day without fog. It took more than an hour to drive into the city from Baishiyi. Along the way, there were thousands of mountains and ridges. Most of the air-raid shelters from the war years have been sealed off with wooden fences, and a few of them are inhabited.</p>
<p>Passing the Jialing River, the water was very shallow as it was low tide. Seeing the river, it's easy to recall Chongqing during the war. How lively this mountain city was at that time! Now everything is silent, like the beach after the tide has receded.</p>
<p>In the evening, I stayed at the Lizhi Society, a delicate three-story Western-style building. The bathroom facilities were much better than in Guangzhou, although there was no hot water, the cold water was continuous. However, the poor electricity was comparable to the "ghost lights" of Guangzhou.</p>
<p>People who have lived in Chongqing probably never forget the rats of Chongqing. Sichuan rats can be said to be unmatched in the world. At night, the rat leader strutted around the room, as if he was inspecting the troops without a commander. Others came and went freely in the room, with no one in their eyes, which also made you marvel.</p>
<p>The rickshaws in Chongqing are still as dilapidated as before, perhaps even more so. The weather in Chongqing is still as gloomy as ever. The only difference is that Chongqing is not as lively as it used to be.</p>
<p>Seeing Chongqing again makes me miss the days of the War of Resistance. It seems to have been at least a little better than now. If that's the case, when will the good days we are waiting for and hoping for come?</p>
<p>Lanzhou:</p>
<p>After staying in Chongqing for two days, I flew to Lanzhou on April 3rd.</p>
<p>Lanzhou is the capital of Gansu Province, and the Chairman of Gansu Province, Guo Jiqi, is stationed here. When we arrived, we were warmly received by Chairman Guo and his wife. We stayed at Chengqingguan, in a room where President Chiang and his wife, Wallace (we don't want to be associated with Wallace, we hereby declare), Willkie, Marshall, and British Ambassador Stephen had stayed during the war. The architecture is very modern, and the garden has pavilions and towers. Behind the house is a building called Wanghe Tower, from which you can see the rolling Yellow River, flowing continuously. As the Tang poem says, "The Yellow River rises far beyond the white clouds, a thousand miles of Jiangling, ten thousand fathoms of mountains. Why should the Qiang flute complain about the willows? The spring breeze does not reach the Jade Gate Pass."</p>
<p>Gansu Province is the gateway to the Northwest. To enter the Northwest, you must pass through Gansu. In ancient times, it was a strategic location for military strategists. Now, with the progress of the times, its position is becoming increasingly important. Chairman Guo stationed troops here, and his mission is self-evident.</p>
<p>In the evening, Chairman Guo hosted a banquet, serving wine that is said to be a specialty of Lanzhou. It is fragrant and mellow, and easy to get drunk. There was a dance party, and all the music broadcast on the radio was American. It was hard to believe that I was in Lanzhou.</p>
<p>It is said that the weather in Lanzhou is very cool in summer, making it an ideal place to escape the heat. Moreover, there are no mosquitoes. At that time, the leaves are green and the flowers are red, and various fruits are on the market. Chairman Guo said that he must invite us to spend the summer there.</p>
<p>Ningxia:</p>
<p>On the 4th, I arrived in Ningxia, which is also the authentic Northwest.</p>
<p>The plane flew along the Yellow River, and the mountains and rivers were all earthy yellow, and the houses gradually became sparse. We knew we had reached the authentic Northwest.</p>
<p>The Chairman of Ningxia Province, Ma Hongkui, and his wife personally came to the airport to greet us. I had long heard of Chairman Ma and his wife. Their every word, every smile, and every action were truly like their reputation. Chairman Ma is currently suffering from severe diabetes and his weight is increasing, so walking is very inconvenient. Madame Ma is suffering from early-stage polio, and her steps are also difficult. We felt very sorry that we made them come to greet us in person.</p>
<p>The house we stayed in was arranged by Madame Ma, who got out of bed despite her illness and spent three days and three nights. There were French sofa beds, New York decorations, and what I considered a miracle was that there was hot and cold running water and neon lights. Madame Ma also burned incense, raised red plums, brewed fragrant tea from Beiping, hung a brazier, and hung embroidered curtains in our bedroom. Secretary Shu Boyan said as soon as he entered the room: "This is a palace!" Yes, this is a palace, let us have an emperor's dream tonight.</p>
<p>Chairman Ma led his troops to Ningxia in the spring of the 22nd year (of the Republic) and it has been almost twenty years. At the beginning of his tenure, the people were poor, the treasury was empty, and the villages were uneasy. But after he cleared the land, reorganized finance, promoted the Baojia system, water conservancy, tree planting, and loans to farmers, this poor area has gradually made progress. Chairman Ma's army has also spared no effort in suppressing bandits. In the winter of the 36th year, he sent troops to relieve the siege of Yulin, defeating Peng Dehuai's main force. Now, in the midst of the voices of defending the Northwest, his aim remains consistent.</p>
<p>In order to make General Chen understand the defense of the Northwest, on the second day after our arrival in Ningxia, Chairman Ma summoned more than 10,000 troops for General Chen to review, including cavalry, infantry, and artillery. On that vast parade ground, yellow dust billowed, and more than 10,000 officers and soldiers performed various exercises, which was a magnificent sight.</p>
<p>Helan Mountain. Everyone in Ningxia Province never forgets Yue Fei's heroic words, "Driving a long chariot, trampling on the Que of Helan Mountain; with the ambition to eat the flesh of the barbarians when hungry, laughing and talking and drinking the blood of the Xiongnu when thirsty!"</p>
<p>The people of the Northwest are all determined to fight the communists. Most of them are Muslims and are irreconcilable with communism. The Northwest is now preparing for joint defense. Chairman Ma said that as long as he is alive, he will not allow Ningxia to become communist. Even if he dies, there are his sons and grandsons, and they will resist to the end.</p>
<p>Qinghai:</p>
<p>The traveler's sentinel drum is dark in the wind and sand, and the princess's pipa is full of melancholy. Camping for thousands of miles without city walls, rain and snow fall one after another, connecting the vast desert. — Li Qi —</p>
<p>The wind and sand in Qinghai are so strong, the men of Qinghai are so strong, the horses of Qinghai are so good, the mutton of Qinghai is so fragrant, and the girls there are also very beautiful. This is our impression of Qinghai.</p>
<p>Driving from the airport to the city, my hair turned from black to gray because the wind and sand blew in my face along the way, making it difficult to open my eyes. The trees on the plateau have not yet turned green or blossomed. Three or five sheep graze on the ridges, countless horses, the land is vast and the sky is long, the yellow desert is desolate, a picture of the severe winter in the Northwest.</p>
<p>Chairman Ma Bufang is not only a capable leader, but also a sincere Muslim. His only son, Ma Jiyuan, is now leading 40,000 to 50,000 troops stationed at the junction of Gansu and Qinghai. Last year, he defeated the Red Bandits in the Pingliang battle, and his reputation was greatly enhanced. It is said that the communists retreat without a fight when they see the broadsword team he leads. Many American reporters have visited him on the front line, calling him a Muslim hero.</p>
<p>Chairman Ma has achieved great results in governing Qinghai. His performance in the military and political aspects can be seen locally, and even more achievements have been made in education. We visited two schools and were very satisfied with both. There is a kindergarten in Xining City with more than 1,400 students. There are two middle schools and a women's normal school. In the evening, Chairman Ma invited us to attend a welcome meeting for the students, where the students gave various performances. From the students' performances, we can see that the education and training they receive is mainly to protect their homeland and Qinghai. The programs include "Four Degrees of Yumen Pass" and "Unity is Strength," which are all very meaningful themes.</p>
<p>Muslims eat only mutton, boiled, roasted, or stewed. Among them, roasted mutton is the most delicious. Rice is scarce, and there is more flour. Lotus seeds and tea are both delicacies. If the people there treat you with lotus seed soup, that is the most remarkable thing. It is said that a bowl of lotus seeds is equal to a table of wine and dishes, believe it or not.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning the public security in Qinghai Province. There, I did not see a single policeman, and there were no guards at the city gates. People came and went freely, but there were no bandits or communists, and there was no curfew at night. This inner peace is not easy to find in China today.</p>
<p>The people of Qinghai are very simple and honest. However, they are capable warriors and they are not afraid of death. Muslim women do not seem to have much status, but it is much better than before. I saw many girls with red faces walking on the road. They used to be confined to their homes, but now they are allowed to go out.</p>
<p>The impression the Northwest gave me was deep, majestic, and bright. The mountains and rivers there are grand, and the people there are hardworking. The Yellow River flows through the undulating land, flowing non-stop, flooding every year, bringing endless pain to the people. Ah, this is the sigh of the earth!</p>
<p>However, the Northwest also has many treasures, waiting for us to develop. There are virgin lands, which have been lying quietly for many years, allowing the desert storm to cover them, unheard of.</p>
<p>The Northwest is vast and sparsely populated. In addition, because it has not received assistance from the central government for decades, the people are still inevitably poor despite their continuous efforts. Now the position of the Northwest is becoming increasingly important. What a great land, how should we cherish it!</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Principles of Issuing Local Currency</h3>
<p>The issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificate has never been separated from finance, which destined it to a tragic fate; and it has also led to today's economic recession, financial disorder, and fiscal difficulties. This phenomenon has a significant impact on financial planning, but it is even more profound in harming local people's livelihood. In recent times, local governments and public opinion institutions have felt the pressure of inflation, which is becoming heavier and heavier. In order to save the financial and economic crisis, they have proposed the issuance of local currency and have already put it into practice. Although the central authorities have expressed dissatisfaction with this move, they are unable to take action to stop it due to the unsoundness of the Gold Yuan Certificate itself.</p>
<p>In a wide range of areas across the country, except for Taiwan, which has special circumstances, and the areas occupied by the Communist army, there is almost no place without its own independent currency. For example, the Central Bank will issue silver dollar certificates in South China, Yunnan has issued semi-open silver dollar certificates, and Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces have issued silver dollar subsidiary currency certificates. Guizhou is also preparing to issue "provincial currency". Xinjiang, Sichuan, and Xikang provinces are also brewing to issue silver dollar certificates. The area where the Gold Yuan Certificate is actually used can be said to be only Shanghai. Therefore, the loss of inflation is also borne by a small number of people in Shanghai. Although Shanghai has always been a rich area in the country, from the perspective of the principle of fairness in fiscal burden, this is really inappropriate. What's more, among the general classes in this city, public utilities have a unique "pricing index", postal and telecommunications have self-defined "postal and telecommunications units", aviation, railways, and waterways all charge fees based on silver dollars, the Customs charges import goods with "Customs Yuan", and the National Taxation Bureau calculates the finished products of factories with "Tax Yuan". They have all cleverly avoided the loss of inflation. May I ask who bears this loss?</p>
<p>The people of Shanghai are in such a bad environment and must quickly find a way out in order to resist the violence of currency and maintain the prosperity of industry and commerce. At the end of last month, Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Yan Esheng, representative of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, suggested at the municipal government's reception that commercial banks in the city should deposit reserves and issue Shanghai local currency. It was reported that Mayor Chen immediately supported the proposal. However, the above-mentioned local currency has not yet had a concrete plan to this day, and there has been no response from all parties, which really makes us extremely depressed. We deeply hope that all parties concerned will continue to work hard to realize it as soon as possible, and save the people from suffering.</p>
<p>In order to give full play to the use of local currency, it is necessary to be particularly cautious beforehand. Here, we believe that the following principles must be observed:</p>
<p>First, it should be recognized that the issuance of local currency is for purely economic needs and should not be subject to the pressure of military expenditures in fiscal expansion, and the issuance should not be excessive.</p>
<p>Second, sufficient cash reserves must be prepared for the people to redeem at any time, and to lay the most basic credit.</p>
<p>Third, the issuing institution must be independent. It must not be presided over by the Central Bank or the Municipal Bank. It is best to entrust the joint issuance of several larger commercial banks in the city to avoid being constrained by military and political expenses.</p>
<p>If the local currency can strictly observe these principles, and the preparation is sufficient and the redemption is sufficient, then the chips issued, no matter what paper money, can win the trust of the society. As for the technical details, such as preparing sufficient subsidiary coins, the procedures for the acting redemption bank, and the legal ratio with the Gold Yuan, etc., can be left to the issuing institution to discuss.</p>
<p>Whether the local currency issued in Shanghai can still circulate is a question that cannot be ignored. At present, some people believe that if the Gold Yuan Certificate is still allowed to circulate in the market, not only will the people's living standards be greatly affected, but also the currency chips will be extraordinarily increased, forming a greater expansion of currency. This concern has its necessity in theory, but in terms of facts, if the central government does not object to the issuance of local currency in this city, then it is clear that the burden of loss due to currency depreciation in this city has been reduced. Even if it continues to be harmed, it must be relatively mild. Furthermore, there are many central military and political agencies in Shanghai, and where will all the salaries and supplies come from if the central government does not provide them with Gold Yuan Certificates? Therefore, our compromise view on the above question is that we may allow the Gold Yuan Certificate and local currency to circulate at the same time, but in fact, after a considerable period of time, the Gold Yuan Certificate will inevitably be ruthlessly eliminated with the natural trend of the economy.</p>
<h3>Visitors from Suzhou Talk About the Wind and Rain; The First Step After the District Army Entered the City Was to Ask for Comfort Items; Industry and Commerce Have No Business and Will All Close Down</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A visitor came from Suzhou, detailing the situation before and after the city changed hands.</p>
<p>It is said that on the night of April 26th, the main force of the defending army had withdrawn eastward, leaving only a few rearguard troops in the Fengqiao area. On the morning of the 27th, after a small contact, the Communist army entered Panmen. At that time, all the shops in the area were closed. However, after entering, the Communist army knocked on each door, instructing them to open for business as usual. During the emergency period, a business group was temporarily formed in the urban area to defend against petty thefts, so order was maintained throughout, and shops and residents did not suffer losses.</p>
<p>Uninvited Guests Live in People's Homes</p>
<p>Most of the Communist army that entered Suzhou City marched quickly through the urban area and headed towards Sujia Road via Xiangmen. The rest stayed in the city, generally dispersed and stayed in people's homes. Those who lived in houses with large houses and few people were visited by these uninvited guests, in groups of three or five, and the homeowners dared to be angry but dared not speak out.</p>
<p>After the Communist army entered the city, they issued a notice changing Suzhou to a city, appointing Hui Yuzi and Wu Ming as mayor and deputy mayor, and establishing a Military Control Commission, with Wei Guoqing as the chairman. The first step after entering the city was to summon representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and request a batch of comfort items, including 3,000 packs of cigarettes, 3,000 dozen socks, 10,000 dans of rice, and 5,000 silver dollars. It was also decided to borrow 40% of the annual grain production from the landlords.</p>
<p>Receivers Are Ignorant</p>
<p>This time, the retreat of the Nationalist army in Jiangnan was beyond the expectations of the Communist army, so they admitted that they were completely unprepared for all the reception work. The receivers were very young, generally around 20 years old, both men and women. Most of them had a middle school education, and they were ignorant of the business situation of the receiving agencies. The complexity of financial institutions made them even more helpless. According to those who were involved, it was estimated that it would take at least three months to complete the reception work at the current speed. When the manager of the Suzhou branch of the "People's Bank" first summoned representatives of the banks to talk, he was wearing a soldier's uniform, which surprised everyone present.</p>
<p>There was also no overall plan for the currency exchange beforehand.</p>
<p>People's Currency Also Devalued</p>
<p>There are no regulations on the redemption of Gold Yuan Certificates. However, the value of the People's Currency is also constantly falling. Initially, it was stipulated that one silver dollar could be exchanged for 400 yuan of People's Currency, but after five days, the black market rose to 740 yuan. The price of gold also rose accordingly, and people's lives were difficult. The price of rice once rose to nine silver dollars per dan, pork was about three catties per yuan, and vegetable prices also soared. The people said, "Each crab is worse than the last."</p>
<p>As far as industry and commerce as a whole are concerned, they have entered a state of stagnation. Although shops reluctantly open, customers are few and far between. Business people predict that if the situation does not change, they will all close down within a month or two. The banks that specialize in high-interest speculation on weekdays are even facing desperation. The Military Control Commission is currently investigating the equity situation of various banks, threatening that if it is found that there is bureaucratic capital involved, it will be confiscated.</p>
<p>Private Life Temporarily Left Alone</p>
<p>Interference in people's private lives has not yet begun. The main reason is that political workers have not yet arrived in large numbers, and the number of those who have arrived is too small. They are busy with other reception work, and they clearly have no time to manage this. However, the Military Control Commission has indeed transferred a batch of local cadres from northern Jiangsu to Suzhou to serve as district chiefs and town chiefs. At that time, people's free lives may come to an end.</p>

<h3>Eve of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference: Acheson Clarifies Stance; List of US Delegation Announced; Jessup and Bohlen Fly to Paris Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Washington, November 11 Broadcast: US Secretary of State Acheson stated at a press conference that whether the East and West can reach an agreement at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference depends on whether the Soviet Union is willing to support the Western countries in integrating Germany into a peaceful European group. Acheson also stated: US policy is to unify Germany and ensure that all people enjoy basic civil rights. The United States does not intend to accept any proposal for a unified Germany that cannot guarantee these basic rights. Acheson praised the West German leaders for drafting the German federal constitution with satisfactory results.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, October 10] A London reporter for the "New York Times" reported that after the Soviet Foreign Minister's visit to Germany, he immediately began preparing for the district foreign ministers conference to be held in Paris on May 23. Some people still express doubts about the results of this conference. They believe that unless the Soviet Union completely changes its attitude held at the previous foreign ministers' conference, the Paris conference cannot be expected to achieve any success. As far as the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France are concerned, they all hold a firm attitude towards their goals. They believe that the Soviet Union's decision to lift the blockade is only a change of means and not a change of principle. Its main goal is still to place Germany within the Soviet sphere of influence. So far, the goals of the three powers in the Paris talks have been completely unified, but the means or strategies to be adopted at the meeting remain to be unified. Observers here believe that the Soviet Union's policy at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference will be based on the German plan drafted by the Soviet Union and its satellite countries in Warsaw last June. The declaration issued after the meeting suggested (1) completely disarming Germany; (2) four-power co-management of the Ruhr industrial area; (3) four-power agreement on the organization of an all-German government of various parties; (4) concluding a peace treaty with Germany so that the occupying forces stationed in Germany will withdraw one year after the signing of the peace treaty; (5) formulating measures to make Germany pay compensation.</p>
<p>[US News Service, Washington, October 10] At the Foreign Ministers Conference to be opened in Paris on May 23, the chief representative of the United States will be Secretary of State Acheson, and US Ambassador at Large Jessup will serve as alternate representative. The State Department today announced the temporary list of US representatives as follows: US Representative to the United Nations Dulles will serve as an advisor to the delegation. Dulles is one of the Republican Party's experts on foreign affairs. Murphy, Director of the German and Austrian Affairs Office of the State Department, will serve as the US Deputy Representative on German Affairs. Murphy was originally the political advisor to General Clay, the US military governor in Germany. Special Assistant to the Secretary of State Bartel and Special Assistant to the Ambassador at Large Yust will serve as special assistants to the US Chairman Representative and Alternate Representative respectively. Ketchina, Director of the International Conferences Group of the State Department, will serve as Secretary-General of the delegation. Other advisors to the delegation include State Department Counselor Bohlen, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for German and Austrian Affairs Pim, Director of the Eastern European Affairs Office Reinhardt, Head of the German Political Affairs Group Trivy, Head of the German Economic Affairs Group Reinstein, Officer of the German and Austrian Affairs Office Halleson, and State Department Legal Advisor on German Affairs Oppenheimer. Press releases for the delegation will be handled by State Department Press Liaison Officer McDermott. Jessup and Bohlen will travel to Paris on the 12th to conduct preliminary discussions before the opening of the Foreign Ministers Conference. Acheson and other representatives will fly to France at the end of next month.</p>
<h3>The Berlin Blockade Exceeds Ten Months: Land Traffic Opens Today; First Train in the British Sector Prepares to Depart</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, November 11] The Berlin blockade, which once almost led to a dispute between the East and West, will end peacefully tonight. At one minute past midnight Berlin time, land traffic to West Germany will be reopened. This is the three hundred and twenty-seventh day of the Soviet blockade of Berlin, and the three hundred and twentieth day of the Anglo-American airlift to break the blockade.</p>
<p>Although the Soviet blockade and the Western counter-blockade are coming to an end, the dispute between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies over the German issue will continue. The second stage of the dispute will begin at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris on May 23.</p>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, November 11] Five cars of the first train after the lifting of the Berlin blockade departed from here this morning and are scheduled to arrive at Lier Munster on the border of the British military zone this afternoon to connect with the British military train. The British military train is scheduled to cross the border line tomorrow morning. If there are no obstacles on the way, it will arrive in Berlin at 6:30 am (Berlin time) tomorrow morning. The train will carry British and American officials such as Inglis, the director of the British and American zone traffic office, and about 100 journalists.</p>
<p>Tricolor National Flags Flutter in the Wind</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, October 10] West Berlin Mayor Luther today ordered the West German flag with red and black colors and gold bars to be hung all over Berlin. Trams and buses will also hang this flag. Buses to Hanover, Hamburg, and Frankfurt in West Germany will also hang this flag. On the first day of the lifting of the Berlin blockade, there will be ten coal trains and six trains carrying fresh potatoes and consumer goods entering Berlin. In the future, 120,000 tons will be supplied to Berlin every day, which is the same as the highest amount of airlift.</p>
<p>Shops in the Western District Are Discounting</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, October 10] The people of Berlin believe that the ten-month blockade can be lifted smoothly, and all technical differences can be resolved before the lifting of the blockade. Today, shops in the Western District selling clothing and luxury goods have discounted more than one-tenth of their prices. The Economic Commission of the Soviet Zone expects to be able to obtain a large amount of imports from West Germany in the future, so it has announced the cancellation of quantitative rationing of certain types of clothing, porcelain, bicycle tires, and furniture. The American Governor Clay stated that after the resumption of East-West trade, the Soviet Union will not directly benefit from Marshall Aid. Trade will be based on barter in principle, so Eastern Europe may indirectly obtain some American aid materials.</p>
<h3>West Berlin to Announce New Municipal Plan</h3>
<p>Refuses to Compromise with Eastern District Authorities</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 10th] West Berlin City Council Chairman Suhr declared today that after the Berlin blockade is lifted, the West Berlin municipal authorities will still refuse to discuss any topics with the East Berlin authorities, otherwise it will be tantamount to acknowledging "this illegal organization." Unless the East Berlin City Council resigns unconditionally, Berlin will not be able to return to unification. Suhr also stated that when the West Berlin City Council meets at 9:00 AM on the 12th, British Inspector-General Robertson, Deputy Minister McCloy, and Deputy Minister Noailles will also be present. At that time, Mayor Reuter will announce the municipal plan after the lifting of the blockade.</p>
<h3>Bidding Farewell to the German People, McCloy Speaks Earnestly</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 11th] U.S. Military Governor for Germany McCloy is about to retire and return to his country. Today, he bid farewell to the Economic Commission of the U.S.-British merged zone in Germany. It is said that the United States hopes for German unification, and it is essential that each occupying zone equally protects the freedoms included in the Bonn Constitution. Germans should dedicate themselves to three major tasks: (1) Understanding freedom; (2) Resolving never to abandon freedom; (3) Using freedom appropriately. McCloy's remarks are consistent with the previous statement of British Military Governor for Germany Robertson, who stated that Western countries will never sell out fundamental democratic rights in the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<h3>West German New Constitution Likely to be Approved by Allied Nations</h3>
<p>[Reuters Bonn, 10th] According to an announcement by a British military government spokesman, the three-power governors will meet in Frankfurt on the afternoon of the 12th to approve the West German constitution.

<h3>West Germany Decides to Establish Capital in Bonn; Beethoven's Birthplace Has Beautiful Scenery</h3>
<p>[Reuters Bonn, West Germany, 10th] The West German Constitutional Assembly passed a resolution late yesterday by a majority of 203 votes to make Bonn, a city on the Rhine River renowned for its scenery, the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany. During the voting, 29 votes favored making Frankfurt the capital, and both Communist Party members abstained. Bonn is the hometown of the great musician Beethoven and is a famous university town and academic center. During the massive bombing in 1944, most of the university and library were destroyed, but Beethoven's former residence and the Beethoven Museum were fortunately undamaged.</p>
<p>[United Press Bonn, 10th] The Constitutional Assembly also passed the second reading of the West German regime election bill by a vote of 36 to 28. The bill stipulates that anyone who has been a member of the Nazi Party may not be elected as a member of parliament or president of the republic. It also stipulates that the lower house of parliament will have 400 members, half of whom will be elected based on a majority, and the remaining half will be appointed proportionally.</p>
<h3>East-West Economic Systems Can Coexist; Three Powers Have Potential for Cooperation; Moscow Radio Broadcasts in English</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 10th] Moscow Radio reporter Vavilov broadcast in English today, stating that cooperation between the economic systems of the United States and the Soviet Union is both possible and necessary. This broadcast, made two weeks before the resumption of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, is particularly noteworthy. Vavilov stated, "The three major powers of the anti-Hitler alliance, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, have already shown the world that different economic systems can cooperate very successfully during World War II. Since two different economic systems can cooperate during wartime, they can certainly cooperate even better in peacetime. To maintain lasting peace, this cooperation is not only possible but also necessary."</p>
<h3>Austrian Peace Treaty Negotiations Postponed to Next Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 11th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' representatives' meeting on the Austrian peace treaty, which has continued for three months, was adjourned today. Although the meeting has been going on for three months, no solution has yet been reached on the basic issues in the peace treaty. The only hope for breaking the deadlock now lies in the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries after the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. Discussions on the peace treaty began in July 1947, and have been repeatedly postponed and reopened. The current meeting, which began three months ago, has ultimately failed to produce significant results due to the numerous obstacles in East-West relations. It is now agreed that the next meeting will be held no later than June 25th. It is not yet known whether the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference will discuss the Austrian issue. Britain believes that the Austrian issue may also be discussed at the Paris Conference, but the foreign ministers must first deal with the German issue. Therefore, it is expected that unless the German issue is resolved, the thorny problems in the Austrian peace treaty will be difficult to resolve.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Approves Atlantic Treaty</h3>
<p>Approves the Two German Constitutions with Reservations</p>
<p>[Our News] London, 11th Broadcast: Paris dispatch, the French cabinet unconditionally approved the Atlantic Treaty and the proposed European Parliament. After a three-hour meeting, a communique was issued stating that the two proposals will be submitted to President Auriol for approval, and then submitted to the National Assembly for debate. In addition, the cabinet approved the West German constitution, with some reservations.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Pandit Visits Acheson</h3>
<p>Discusses the Presentation of Credentials</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 10th] The newly appointed Indian Ambassador to the United States, Mrs. Pandit, had a brief conversation with Secretary of State Acheson today to discuss the issue of presenting her credentials. Afterwards, she told reporters that India is not currently afraid of the possibility of Chinese Communist troops invading. The ambassador continued, stating that India will be self-sufficient in food in 1950. The food problem is still the most pressing issue, but she has confidence in the future.</p>
<h3>West German Basic Law Guarantees Human Rights, Prevents Re-Aggression; Calls for National Unity, Establishes Foundation for Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press Bonn, 10th] Article 146 of the new constitution of the German Federation stands out in the history of constitutions of various countries. The most constitutional provision stipulates the prohibition of aggressive wars and the transfer of national sovereignty to the future European Federation, which is a pioneering move. The chapter on human rights recognizes that "human dignity is inviolable..." All postal and telecommunications inspections, press censorship, and inspections of books, newspapers, and magazines are prohibited. The new constitution not only requires Germans to abide by international law but also gives them greater freedom, a freedom that Germans had not even enjoyed before Hitler.</p>
<p>Any ambitious person who changes the constitution "by force or attempts to change it by force" or usurps the functions of the head of state and becomes a dictator is subject to life imprisonment. German political leaders praised this constitution as "the most progressive charter in the world."</p>
<p>Secondly, the constitutional provisions repeatedly call for national unification, stating that West Germany is only temporary in nature, which shows that it does not want to formally make the east and west parts permanently divided. The preamble states, "The German people, deeply aware of their responsibility to God and to mankind, are determined to preserve their national and political unity, to contribute to world peace in a position of equality in the European Federation, and, on the basis of their constitutional powers, to enact this Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, thereby giving a new order to political life during the transition period. The Parliament is acting on behalf of the other German people (referring to East Germany), whose participation has not been rejected. All the German people must now complete the freedom and unity of Germany through free self-determination." The article on the territory stipulated in the constitution also uses the word "temporary."</p>
<p>The Bonn Constitution, for the sake of emphasizing peace, does not stipulate the establishment of an army or the right to declare war, and declares that no German may be drafted "against his conscience." The article prohibiting aggressive wars or preparing for aggressive wars states: "Any act that disturbs or intends to disturb peaceful relations among countries, especially preparing for aggressive wars, is unconstitutional and should be punished." German security must rely on international collective protection, and its sovereign provisions stipulate that it is transferred to "international institutions" such as the European Federation. In order to maintain peace, the German Federation may participate in "mutual collective security organizations."</p>
<p>Regarding the chapter on human rights, the new constitution stipulates: (1) All people are equal before the law. (2) Freedom of publication and freedom of reporting by radio and film shall be guaranteed and shall not be censored. (3) All German people may engage in peaceful and unarmed gatherings without prior notice or permission. (4) Homes are inviolable. (5) No one shall be discriminated against or privileged because of gender, origin, race, language, belief, or political opinion. (6) "The powers of the states are conferred by the people and shall be exercised by the people through legislative, administrative, and judicial organs."</p>
<p>The constitution declares that people can "freely form" various political parties, but it also lays the foundation for prohibiting the activities of the Communist Party or any militarist faction, stipulating that political parties must be based on "democratic principles" and that those who attempt to endanger the "free democratic basic order" or endanger the existence of the Federation are in violation of the constitution.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Commonwealth Conference Will Be Submitted to the Indian Parliament for Approval; Nehru Addresses the Nation in New Delhi</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse New Delhi, 10th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru broadcast to the nation tonight, expressing satisfaction with the resolution of the long-standing feud between India and Britain, stating: "The fact that the conflict between India and Britain can be resolved in a friendly manner is a good omen." The Prime Minister stated: "I arrived here three days ago after attending the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London. Today, I am reporting to you on the historic decisions made at this conference. These decisions will be submitted to the Indian Parliament for approval and will be discussed by the All India Congress Committee Council. The work that I and others completed in London last month will be finally evaluated by these two great institutions."</p>
<p>India's Foreign Policy is Friendly to All Countries</p>
<p>Nehru believes that the vast majority of people welcome this resolution. He said: "I have repeatedly declared that our foreign policy is to strive for peace and to have friendly relations with all countries, and to avoid joining political blocs. This is still the guiding principle of our policy. We swore a long time ago to complete India's complete independence. This point has now been completed, but India's union with other states in the Commonwealth does not therefore lose its independence, because this union is completely free and there are absolutely no obligations. We need to know that the Commonwealth does not have the meaning of a super-national country. We have agreed to regard the King of England as the symbolic head of this free union, but the King of England does not have any authority over the position of the Commonwealth. The King of England does not have any position in the Indian Constitution, so we do not have to be loyal to him. When I made this decision, I certainly considered the interests of India, because this is my first responsibility, but I have always believed that the greatest responsibility is the welfare of the whole world. This is the lesson that Mahatma Gandhi gave us. Mahatma also taught us to pursue the path of peace and to be friendly with other countries while maintaining India's freedom and dignity. The world today is full of battles, and a great disaster is brewing. The hatred, fear, and suspicion in the hearts of mankind have blinded their vision. Therefore, we welcome any action that can reduce friction in the world.</p>
<p>India Will Become a Bridge Between East and West</p>
<p>I know very well that there are many situations in some parts of the Commonwealth that make us very dissatisfied, which were the goals of our past solo struggle, but we will deal with these situations as an independent and sovereign country and cannot confuse unrelated matters. India will strive to become a bridge between the warring parties, helping to maintain what is most urgently needed today and in the future, which is world peace. My agreement to the London Agreement is because I firmly believe that India can therefore better promote its policy of encouraging peace and freedom and reducing hatred and friction. We should not waste time on empty debates at this critical juncture in the world, and we should focus our efforts on the most urgent task today, enabling India to become a great and strong country, fulfilling its responsibility to benefit people in Asia and around the world.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Army Exercises</h3>
<p>[Reuters Oslo, 10th] Norwegian army officers today began the largest-scale exercises since the war in southeastern Norway, presided over by Army Commander General Munthe-Kaas.

The goal of the exercises is to study defense conditions and the state of readiness in the southeastern region and around Oslo.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Leader Advocates for Restoration of Relations with Spain</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 10th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally, during the Senate's discussion of the Spanish issue today, stated that he felt there was no reason why the United States should not send an ambassador to Madrid. He also believed that the State Department was under pressure from foreign countries and could not fully recognize the Franco regime. Connally emphasized that he believed it was unreasonable for the United States to maintain diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union while refusing to maintain diplomatic relations with Spain. It should be noted that the U.S. sends ambassadors to other countries to represent the United States, not other foreign governments. Republican Senator Brewster also believed that the U.S. did not send an ambassador to Madrid due to pressure from Britain and France. Democratic Senator McCarran believes that Spain should also be included in the Atlantic Treaty, because all democratic countries that "believe in God and love freedom" are willing for Spain to participate in the anti-communist front.</p>
<h3>Ireland Demands Return of the North; Protests British Obstruction of Unification</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 10th] The Irish Parliament today unanimously passed a resolution moved by Prime Minister Costello, demanding that Britain end the "current occupation" of Northern Ireland.

The resolution called on the British government to "end the occupation of the six counties of Northern Ireland, so that the unification of Ireland can be restored and the long-standing dispute between the two countries can be resolved." Opposition leader and former Prime Minister de Valera also expressed support for Costello's motion.</p>

<p>[United Press Tokyo, 11th] Prime Minister Yoshida on the 11th urged the world to ease its view of Japan and asked to give Japan a chance to "compete fairly in the peaceful world" and become self-sufficient. Yoshida made this dramatic appeal while speaking to foreign reporters at the Tokyo Reporters Association. He asked that the new Japan under his leadership be judged from a different perspective, not from the perspective of the aggressive Japan under the control of the former warlords. Yoshida praised General MacArthur, saying that MacArthur "has made unlimited contributions in leading us on the road to recovery."</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Invade Iran; Shooting Incident Occurs</h3>
<p>[Reuters Tehran, 11th] Unconfirmed reports from the Caspian Sea port of Astara say that over the weekend, Soviet sentries invaded the Iranian border, and the sentries of the two countries exchanged gunfire.

The report also stated that Tehran attached great importance to this matter, and the two governments are now investigating and studying it.</p>
<h3>Draft News Convention Passed by UN Social Committee</h3>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 10th] The UN Social Committee tonight passed the world's first draft convention on international news transmission and the right to correction. The vote was 27 to 4, with 12 abstentions. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, and Yugoslavia all voted against it. Soviet representative Konov said the draft convention "completely benefits newspaper tycoons and does not protect small countries." The draft convention must be passed by the UN General Assembly. The full text has 23 chapters, plus a preamble chapter. The main purpose is to guarantee that reporters are not discriminated against when they gather news and send news abroad. Regarding the right to correction, the government of the country concerned guarantees to accept the request of the government of another country to issue a correction to the original newspaper or news agency, but the newspaper or news agency is not legally bound to publish the correction. It also stipulates that news censorship should be abolished in peacetime, except for news related to national defense.</p>
<h3>Bunche Appeals for Blacks; Asks Americans for Fair Treatment</h3>
<p>He Takes Office as Director of the UN Trusteeship Council</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 10th] Retired Palestine mediator Dr. Bunche, who took office as Director of the UN Trusteeship Council, warned that the American black problem is "more complicated and regrettable than the Palestine problem." Bunche gave a speech at a banquet hosted by the American United Nations Association on the evening of the 9th, stating: "As an American and a black person, I must remind my fellow Americans that all of us who have justice and fairness should devote ourselves to solving a problem in our own country, if we want our own great country to fully implement the Charter principles that all member states of the United Nations have solemnly guaranteed. This problem may be more complicated and regrettable than the Palestine problem."</p>
<h3>British-Soviet Trade Agreement Negotiations Nearing Completion</h3>

<h3>East German People's Congress to Hold Elections</h3>
<p>[British News Agency London, 11th] Elections for the new People's Congress will be held in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin on the 15th and 16th of this month. The People's Congress will review and pass the draft constitution of the "German Democratic Republic," which was drafted by the People's Council and passed by the Council on March 19. The constitution does not have checks and balances to prevent one-party dictatorship and has been severely criticized by non-communist German newspapers. The entire organization of the People's Congress and the People's Council, although ostensibly representing all parties and factions and the entire German people, is entirely manipulated by Soviet-zone communists and their followers and is not supported by the majority of the people. Last summer, the organization planned to hold a referendum. At that time, the U.S.-occupied zone did not allow people to sign, and although it was allowed in the British-occupied zone, there were very few supporters.</p>
<h3>Britain Will Lift Arms Embargo When the Situation in the Middle East Stabilizes</h3>

<h3>Eastern European Countries are Promoting Agricultural Collectivization Plans</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 11th] Official reports from Eastern Europe recently stated that private land assets behind the Iron Curtain will be completely abolished by the end of 1955. The new Bulgarian Five-Year Plan, which arrived in London in the original text, reveals that 60% of Bulgarian farmers will be incorporated into "cooperative labor farms" (collective farms) in 1953. In the final stage of collectivization, class struggle in the village will undoubtedly intensify, and complete collectivization may still take two years to complete.</p>
<h3>Commonwealth Assistance to Burma; British and Burmese to Issue Statement</h3>

<h3>Qing Palace Conspiracy, A Play That is Popular in England</h3>

The London Times and Daily Telegraph have both given high praise to the literary quality and character portrayal of the play "Son of Heaven," which is currently being performed at the New Lindsey Theatre.</p>
<h3>UN Special Political Committee Decides to Postpone Discussion of Dutch-Indonesian Issue; Postponed to Autumn General Assembly for Further Discussion</h3>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 10th] The UN Special Political Committee today decided to postpone the Dutch-Indonesian dispute to the Autumn General Assembly for discussion. The vote was 42 to 6, with only the Soviet bloc voting against it, and 6 countries abstaining. The proposers were India and Australia, who reasoned that Indonesia and the Netherlands had reached an agreement in Batavia, and that it would be more harmful than beneficial for the UN General Assembly to debate it at this time. Previously, Soviet representative Malik had a verbal battle with the chairman of the committee, Philippine representative Romulo. Malik stated that the Indonesian representative knew nothing about the new Dutch-Indonesian agreement, and that India and Australia's proposal completely trusted the Dutch side. The negotiations in Batavia were negotiations between prisoners and prison guards. The Political Committee should allow the Indonesian representative, Palar, to state his opinions. Romulo replied that the Soviet proposal was difficult to accept, and that the Indian-Australian proposal was in fact a proposal to postpone the discussion, and that according to the UN General Assembly's regulations, this type of proposal was a procedural issue that must be discussed first. Furthermore, the Indonesian representative, Palar, does not wish to speak at this time. Malik stated that this proves that the representative was deprived of his right to speak, because the leaders of the Indonesian Republic are in exile on Bangka Island. We must admit that all this is a conspiracy of the Dutch government. Romulo advised Malik not to go beyond the topic, and Malik countered: "The chairman wants to prevent me from speaking, I will do so." Romulo replied: "Your representative has the right to speak, as long as you do not exceed the procedural issues, and do not touch the substance of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. "Indian representative Shiva Rao stated that India does not intend to please any foreign country, and that the Southeast Asian 19-country conference to discuss the Indonesian issue was convened by India. We do not ask to cancel this issue, we only ask that it be postponed to the Autumn General Assembly for discussion. Pakistani representative Zafrulla stated that Pakistan will support the Indian-Australian proposal.</p>

Nie Guangyu of Chongde opened the scoring with a free throw, followed by three consecutive shots by Xu Xingeng, taking the lead 6-3. Subsequently, a seesaw battle ensued. At 14-9, Pang team was forced to call a timeout. Indeed, Zhang Shaoxiang and Huang Yang successively broke through the basket, closing the gap to 13-14. However, Yuan Qing and Xu Xingeng of Chongde applied frequent pressure, and Zhu Neng eventually caught up. At 24-17, Pang team called another timeout, but it did not improve the situation.

<h3>Division One Table Tennis League: Lianxing vs. Bank of China Tonight</h3>
<p>Previous Matches Featured Outstanding Performances by Chou Bai and Chou Hong</p>
<p>The fourth Table Tennis League continues today (the 12th) with one Division One match and three Division Two matches. In Division One, Lianxing will face Bank of China. Lianxing was last year's third-place finisher and has trained diligently this year, harboring strong ambitions to win the championship. They have strong players such as Hu Yiping, Wu Zuochang, Zhang Shanda, and Feng Hao. Although their reputation is second to the two powerhouses Jingwu and Huamei, their players have well-rounded skills in both offense and defense, making them more balanced than any other team. Bank of China will find it difficult to win against such a strong team. If they can put forth their best effort and persevere, they will surely make their opponents think twice about underestimating them.</p>
<p>All three Division Two matches are crucial for their future, and each will feature intense moments. In Division Two Group One, You Si, with six wins and one loss, and in Division Two Group Two, Lianhe, with four wins and no losses, will face formidable opponents Haiguang and Chongben, respectively. They may face dangerous situations. In another match in Division Two Group One, Lingxia will face Ling Team. The former was last year's Division Three runner-up, but they have already been defeated by the "dark horse" Shanbao. The latter is a seeded team from the talk department, but unfortunately, they have already been defeated by the new team Hongbai. Both teams have lost once, and they cannot afford to lose this match. The winner will still have a chance, while the loser will have no hope. A fierce battle is inevitable. The schedule for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Lianxing vs. Bank of China (Division One) 6 PM</p>
<p>Haiguang vs. You Si (Division Two Group One) 7 PM</p>
<p>Chongben vs. Lianhe (Division Two Group Two) 7 PM</p>
<p>Lingyun vs. Ling Team (Division Two Group One) 6 PM</p>
<p>The previous day, Bank of China played against Chou Bai in the latter's table tennis room. Bank of China's lineup was incomplete, so it was inevitable that they would lose. Wang Shaozeng and Zhu Guozhen fought hard against Yang Changxi and Chang Jiakun of Chou Bai, and the battle was extremely intense. In the end, they were exhausted and lost two matches in a row. In the third match, Zhu Yongkang of Bank of China defeated Kong Hanchen in straight sets to win back one match. In the fourth and fifth matches, Bank of China sent out reserve players, so they were no match for Chou Bai and lost successively. As a result, Chou Bai defeated Bank of China 4-1. Among the Division Two matches, the seeded team of Division Three, Xin Xing, performed abnormally. Jian Jiang Gao Shangzhi was out of luck and lost 1-2, forfeiting the victory. Chou Hong benefited from this unexpected gain and was in high spirits. Newcomer Wu Canpeng was inspired and defeated Li Baoyan in straight sets. As a result, Xin Wu suffered another blow and has lost hope of being selected, which is a pity. The results of the two matches and the previous matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Results of the Two Matches</p>

<h3>Accomplices in Xu Wentian Treason Case: Chen Tilu and Five Others Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Police Department executed five people by firing squad at the Song Park Road execution grounds in Zhabei yesterday at 4 PM. The five were convicted of treason and collaborating with the enemy. The executed were Chen Tilu, Zhang Dasheng, Fang Zhichen, Zhu Datong, and Wang Wenzong. Li Yalong, the deputy director of the Changshu Police Sub-bureau, served as the execution supervisor. These five criminals were all important figures in the "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance" organized by Xu Wentian and others. They specialized in inciting mutiny among the National Army, attempting to coordinate with the Communist Army's crossing of the Yangtze River. The mutinies of Jia Yibin's unit from the past He Yu Gan Tuan, Wang Changyan's unit of the 97th Division, Dai Rongguang's unit, the commander of the Jiangyin Fortress, and the 88th Army stationed in Digang were all incited by this organization. Many of these five people were members of the Kuomintang. The authorities believed that they stole a good name, organized illegal groups, sold out the Party and the country, endangered the survival of the nation, and willingly surrendered to the Communists. Their crimes were heinous, so they were presented to Commander-in-Chief Tang for a death sentence, which was approved. According to the police department's announcement:</p>
<p>Chen Tilu</p>
<p>Age 50, from Huaiyin, Jiangsu. He was the director of the Nanjing Wenfeng Bookstore and served as the executive committee member and director of the Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters, the executive committee member of the Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters, the director of the Battlefield Party Affairs Office of the Central Organization Department, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the dean of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Two-District Training Corps. In November of last year, he initiated the organization of the "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance" with Gao Zongyu, Xu Wentian, Liu Butong, and Chen Xiaoling. He served as a standing committee member and organization minister of the pseudo-General Alliance, and also as the person in charge of the Shanghai Branch Alliance. He was the primary drafter of the "Sun Alliance" organizational outline. He also participated in Li Jishen's pseudo-"Kuomintang Reform Committee." He instigated Yan Yimin to defect from our Garrison Headquarters' senior advisor Chen Zumin (Chen understood righteousness and was not moved). He assigned Zhang Dasheng to cross the river to contact the Communists, attempting to divide the government's strength and coordinate with the Communist bandits' crossing of the river, betraying the Party and harming the country, and slandering the leader. He confessed these facts in his interrogation records and his confession.</p>
<p>Zhang Dasheng</p>
<p>Also known as Zhi Ren, 41 years old, from Xiaoxian, Jiangsu. He was the president of the Jiangsu branch of the China Cultural Service Agency and served as the deputy commander of the 18th Column of the Lu-Su-Yu Border Region Headquarters. In the winter of last year, he joined the "Sun Alliance" through Chen Tilu's connection and served as a committee member and secretary of the Jiangsu Branch Alliance. He was also ordered by Chen Tilu to go to Huaiyin, northern Jiangsu, to contact the Communists. From the contents of the Jiangsu Branch Alliance's February 28, 1939, political report resolution—the current political situation and our strategic line—it can be observed that the criminal slandered the leader, attacked our Party, responded to the Communist bandits, and conspired to subvert the government. He admitted these facts in his interrogation records and his confession.</p>
<p>Fang Zhinong</p>
<p>Age 35, from Anhui County, Anhui. He was a teacher at Nanjing Anhui Middle School. In early February of this year, he joined the "Sun Alliance" through Xu Wentian's introduction and served as the secretary of the General Alliance. He confessed to participating in the "Sun Alliance's" acts of betraying the Party and harming the country.</p>
<p>Zhu Datong</p>
<p>Also known as Gong Tao, age 42, from Xiaoxian, Jiangsu. He served as the magistrate of Xiaoxian and is currently an employee of the Kaiyuan Coal Mine Company at Xiashu Station. In late February of this year, he joined the "Sun Alliance" Jiangsu Provincial Branch Alliance through Zhang Dasheng's introduction. According to his confession, he attended two meetings of the branch alliance in Wuxi and Zhenjiang and admitted to being involved in military operations. After verifying the handwriting of the letter from "Kaili" and "Gong Tao" addressed to Gui Shuren, the mayor of Communist Yangzhou, which was seized from Ma Shewen, it was confirmed to be written by the criminal. There is no doubt that he colluded with the Communist bandits and plotted wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Wang Wenzong</p>
<p>Age 29, from Wujin, Jiangsu. He was a clerk at the Jiangsu Provincial Training Corps. He joined the "Sun Alliance" Jiangsu Provincial Branch Alliance through Song Changhuang's introduction and was responsible for clerical work. The booklet of the branch alliance's February 28, 1939, political report resolution was written by him. Reviewing the criminal's diary, his thoughts were radical, and he willingly participated in acts of harming the country.</p>
<p>[Another report] It is reported that after the authorities cracked down on the "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance," a treasonous and enemy-collaborating organization formed by Legislative Yuan members Xu Wentian and Liu Butong, Xu and others used their status as members of the Legislative Yuan to obtain bail in Nanjing. When the Communist army crossed the Yangtze River and occupied Nanjing, Xu, Liu, and others openly came forward to help with the takeover of government agencies.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Industrial Association, and the General Labor Union yesterday morning to discuss the technical issues of paying salaries after converting wages to silver dollars.

The Social Affairs Bureau is studying the opinions put forward by both sides. The matter was submitted to the Garrison Department's Political Affairs Meeting for discussion last night and will be announced today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened various public utility agencies and informed them that the salary payment method announced by the Garrison Department must not be changed. The treatment of public utility employees was previously better than that of other factories and shops. It is hoped that they will be mindful of the difficult times and strive to maintain a consistent pace. They should still strictly follow the salary payment methods implemented during this emergency period.</p>

<h3>Head of Household Registration Raised the Price of Registration Forms: Leader Sentenced to Seven Years</h3>

<h3>Silver Bulls Change Business to Carrying Goods, Carrying Silver Dollars to Other Regions to Sell, and Bringing Pork and Other Goods to Shanghai to Sell</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Since the authorities clearly stipulated that the price of silver dollars in various districts of this city should be uniformly limited to 4 million Gold Yuan, the "yellow bulls" who generally engaged in silver dollar transactions have found it unprofitable in Shanghai. In addition to a small number who have changed their business to "street vending," the rest have transformed into carrying goods, going to Songjiang, Qingpu, and other places to sell silver dollars. Currently, in Songjiang, each silver dollar can be sold for 6.4 million yuan, and in Qingpu, each silver dollar can be sold for 4.8 million yuan. The discounted price of silver dollars in Kunshan, Lujiabang, Jiading, Taicang, and other places is also higher than in Shanghai, regardless of the type. After selling their silver dollars, they buy low-priced pork, eggs, white rice, etc. locally and bring them to Shanghai for sale. Then, they carry cigarettes, soap, and other daily necessities from Shanghai back to various places for sale, engaging in trade back and forth and making huge profits. Under these circumstances, the inventory of silver dollars and daily necessities in this city has flowed to other regions in recent weeks, and the reverse flow of cash from other regions to Shanghai has also been considerable.</p>

Additionally, Mayor Chen is scheduled to convene relevant parties at the Municipal Government this afternoon to discuss the use of U.S. aid materials and other issues.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Trading Stagnant</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn trading was very sluggish yesterday. Although there were calls for prices on the floor, there were very few transactions. Only a few popular goods saw sporadic trading. Customers, due to shipping difficulties and speculative risks, remained passive observers. The local market had an oversupply, and transaction prices were still slightly lower by 10 to 20 million yuan per bale compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>According to market sources, cotton yarn trading is unlikely to flourish in the short term. Most factories in the copying industry have shut down, speculative transactions are almost non-existent, and major players have gone to South China. Only a few small players are still trading.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Market Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market was weak, and merchants' sentiments were low. Although there was some bolstering by floor traders, it briefly prospered, and quoted prices were very close to the previous day's highest prices. However, due to ample supply from various sources taking advantage of the high prices, combined with generally weak prices outside the customs area, prices softened again at the close.</p>
<p>Dragon Head Fine Cloth opened low at 17,400,000, reaching a maximum of 18,600,000 mid-session, a drop of 400,000 compared to the previous day. Four Gentlemen Serge opened 1,000,000 lower at 18,000,000, then rose to 19,200,000, closing at 18,400,000 at noon, a decrease of 600,000. Five Blessings Fine Cloth was traded at 14,600,000, down 1,400,000. Trumpet Child Fine Cloth was traded at 14,800,000, down 1,600,000. Yanghe Fine Cloth factory prices generally fell by about 10%, and trading remained sparse.</p>
<p>Cotton Stable</p>
<p>The cotton market was stable, and trading was slightly more active. Zhoupu seed cotton was quoted at 10,000,000. Hankou fine velvet was used in the exchange of 6,600,000 for every 100 market pounds. Jingfu fine velvet was exchanged for 12 pounds per 100 market pounds, Shenhu fine cloth was exchanged at 5.8 bolts, Hankou fine velvet was exchanged at 625 pounds for 20 count Earth Yarn, Jingyang was exchanged at 820 pounds for 42 count Water Moon Yarn, and other transactions were not idle.</p>
<h3>Various Sectors' Anti-Communist National Salvation Committee Launches "Frontline First, Soldiers First" Campaign</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The Shanghai All Circles Anti-Communist Bandit Suppression National Salvation Committee convened various groups and units at 4:00 PM yesterday. In addition to discussing the holding of a public rally at Central Park at 9:00 AM on the 15th, they also passed an outline for launching the "Frontline First, Soldiers First" campaign to enthusiastically encourage morale. The original text of the outline is recorded below:</p>
<p>(A) Slogans: (1) Everything for the frontline. (2) Everything for combat. (3) Everything for the soldiers. (4) Give the soldiers the best food to eat. (5) Give the soldiers the best things to use. (6) Give the soldiers the best entertainment to enjoy.</p>
<p>(B) Measures: (1) Establish a Heroes' Hall to host meritorious generals and soldiers from the front, providing free meals, haircuts, bathing, theater viewings, etc. (2) Raise funds to comfort frontline soldiers with meat, fish, and other non-staple foods. (3) Raise funds to comfort frontline soldiers with towels, cigarettes, socks, and other daily necessities. (4) Items stored in the Materials Supply Bureau should be allocated to comfort frontline soldiers. (5) Collect medical supplies and recruit medical personnel to serve on the front lines. (6) Improve the staple food for officers and soldiers, ensuring that the rice quality is not too poor. (7) Send photos and stories of combat heroes to various newspapers to show respect and promote their achievements.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Rice trading was temporarily suspended in the South Market yesterday due to the presence of troops. The North Market continued trading as usual. Rice shops, due to the South Market's closure, increased their purchases in the North Market, leading to active sales and rising prices. White japonica, thin paddy rice, and indica rice were all traded at a high of 37,000,000 yuan, up 4,000,000 yuan each. Medium-grade early rice was at 34,000,000 yuan, with only 196 dan of registered arrivals.</p>
<p>The markets for miscellaneous grains and edible oils were temporarily suspended yesterday. However, retail stores still had to purchase from the market, so they eagerly awaited the resumption of trading.</p>
<p>The flour market rebounded yesterday. Bingship morning open at 7,500,000, good clearing in Central Market, Market price rising slowly, and later broke through eight barriers, closing at noon at 82,000,000, Old Car 84,000,000, Red Sound, Jiancheng, Dafa, Peacock, slightly traded, bran still not opening.</p>
<p>Trading was suspended in both edible oil and miscellaneous grain markets yesterday, but roadside transactions were still active. Factory soybean oil closed at 110,000,000 at noon, and raw vegetable oil at 90,000,000, generally higher than the previous day. Cooked vegetable oil and raw oil rose more slowly. Raw sesame oil rose sharply, and soybeans also rose sharply, with Sangyuan beans and winter beans both closing at 14,000,000.</p>
<h3>Industrial Association Cables Authorities to Purchase Finished Products and Provide Loans to Solve Mid-Month Salary Payment Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In response to the current industrial crisis in the city, the Municipal Industrial Association has cabled the Municipal Government, Central Bank, and other agencies to request the purchase of finished products and the provision of loans to resolve the issue of paying salaries in the middle of the month. They also requested permission to lay off some workers to extend the livelihood of the remaining workers in the city. The original telegram stated briefly: Since transportation from North China has been cut off, the Yangtze River has been obstructed, and recently, train services between Nanjing and Shanghai, and Shanghai and Hangzhou have been reduced again. Although sea routes are available, the reduced number of ships makes transportation difficult. As a result, the export of finished industrial products from the city has come to a standstill. In this extraordinary period, factories in various industries cannot stop production nor lay off workers. To maintain social stability and the livelihood of workers, they must make every effort to find solutions. However, funds are exhausted, and they have reached a desperate situation. Taking the salary payment at the end of last month as an example, due to a lack of funds, various factories were forced to pay wages in the form of their own products. Recently, street vendors are crowded, and all kinds of goods are gathered, because these workers are selling their products to make a living. The tragic situation is imaginable. In the blink of an eye, it is again time to pay wages in the middle of the month. According to the temporary measures for calculating employee salaries promulgated, with 600,000 employees in the city, half a month's salary requires approximately 3,000,000 silver dollars, equivalent to 12 trillion gold yuan, a huge sum. The daily funds of various banks in the Central Bank and their joint reserve deposits have never reached this figure. Moreover, in this time of industrial decline, how can they raise such funds? This is the reality and not an excuse. If the government does not provide assistance, the consequences will be dire. The Association, in its duty, dares not remain silent, lest it add to the offense. Therefore, it earnestly presents the current real situation of industry and cables to request that the government, considering the unprecedented crisis faced by industry and the survival of hundreds of thousands of workers, provide strong assistance. It requests that the Central Bank, based on the number of workers in each factory, calculate the required amount of wages, regardless of the type of factory, purchase their finished products, and allow them to be exchanged for silver dollars. For those without finished products (such as the machine industry), loans should be provided based on the number of workers to solve the problem of paying wages in the first half of the month, to maintain the minimum livelihood of workers and protect the endangered industry from collapse. Furthermore, factories are in an extraordinary period and are unlikely to be able to sustain themselves for long. As the countryside is in need of labor during the busy farming season, it is proposed to allow the dismissal of some workers so that they can return to their hometowns to engage in agriculture, which can reduce the burden on various factories, reduce the city's food consumption, and extend the livelihood of the remaining workers. However, convenience and security should be provided for the transportation and along the way of dismissed workers.</p>
<h3>Six Districts Cotton Textile Association Requests National Bank Loan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recently, due to the disconnection between production and sales and the stagnation of business, the selling prices of various yarn factories in the city are lower than the costs, and the payment of wages cannot be delayed, making their situation extremely difficult. The Cotton Textile Association of the Six Districts convened a meeting of representatives from various member factories in the city yesterday and decided on the spot that all directors and supervisors and representatives from various factories would immediately take a letter to the Central Bank requesting an emergency industrial loan of 800 million yuan, with the production equipment of each factory as collateral, to provide relief. There are currently 1.6 million yarn spindles in private yarn factories in the city (including converted looms). If each 10,000 spindles requires 100 billion yuan in monthly wages, the total requirement would be 16 trillion yuan. If the Central Bank approves a loan of 800 million yuan, the remaining half, 800 million yuan, would still need to be raised by the factories themselves to overcome the difficulties and continue production.</p>
<h3>Nantong Sojourners Association in Shanghai to Hold Directors and Supervisors Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The Nantong Sojourners Association in Shanghai recently elected Ma Junshuo and Cai Guohua as Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively, to be stationed at the association and take responsibility. They also decided to re-register members, issue new membership cards, and assist the municipal authorities in handling the evacuation of fellow villagers. Fellow villagers who have temporarily come to Shanghai and have not yet obtained a National Identity Card for the city, or those who have come to Shanghai and have no one to rely on, can go to the association at No. 149 Wujin Road to register. Furthermore, the association's affairs are being actively developed, and the cooperation and service of fellow villagers in Shanghai are urgently needed. A joint meeting of directors and supervisors was scheduled to be held at the association at 3:00 PM today. Additionally, a portion of the association's premises is occupied by military officers' dependents. The Garrison Headquarters has been telegraphed to urge them to move out.</p>

<h3>Taiwan's Financial Industry</h3>
<p>[Taipei 3rd Dispatch] The earliest financial institutions in Taiwan were "Ma Zhen Halls," which were essentially comprador agencies. In the year that Japan took control of Taiwan (1895), the Neutral Bank of Japan established a branch in Taiwan, which can be considered the earliest bank in Taiwan. Later, this bank merged with the Thirty-Fourth Bank of Japan and was renamed the Thirty-Fourth Bank. In 1933, it merged with the Yamaguchi and Hong Kong Land Banks and was renamed the Sanwa Bank. These were purely Japanese banks. In 1899, the Bank of Taiwan, which had the role of a "central bank" in Taiwan, was established. Subsequently, the Taiwan Savings Bank, specializing in savings, the Changhua Bank, with a local focus, the Commercial and Industrial Bank, with a commercial focus, the Industrial Bank of Japan, responsible for agricultural development, and the South China Bank, with an aggressive mission, and the cooperative-oriented Industrial and Financial Association were established one after another. After the Restoration, the government reorganized and merged these banks to form the existing banks, as follows:</p>
<p>Bank of Taiwan</p>
<p>This bank is the central hub of Taiwan's finance. After the Restoration, it was reorganized by merging the Sanwa Bank of Japan, the old Bank of Taiwan, and the old Taiwan Savings Bank. It officially opened in 1946 with a total capital of NT$60 million, allocated by the national treasury. In addition to conducting general banking business, it was specially authorized to issue NT$ within a specified amount and was entrusted by the government to handle the issuance, interest payment, and redemption of government bonds, to act as an agent for public treasuries at all levels and other matters entrusted by the government, and to act as an agent for various businesses entrusted by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank. The bank's head office is located in Taipei, with 77 branches and agencies inside and outside the province. Its businesses include deposits, loans, remittances, issuance, trusts, and savings. As of the end of 1948, the bank's total deposits reached NT$300,808,342,000, an increase of NT$7,219,000 compared to the bank's deposits in 1946. During the same period, total loans were NT$345,167,187,000, mostly used for agricultural, industrial, and mining production, as well as fertilizer and water conservancy loans. The bank has the exclusive right to handle remittances outside the province, but currently, to avoid the impact of mainland prices on Taiwan, all remittances from outside the province have been temporarily suspended. Military and industrial remittances require the approval of the provincial government. The adjustment of the exchange rate between NT$ and gold yuan has been a "disease prevention dam" for Taiwan's prices against those in mainland provinces. In the past, it has been quite effective, but now it has gradually lost its effectiveness. Although the exchange rate has been adjusted from 3,703 to 163 within two months, Taiwan's prices are still rising wildly. According to a comparison of price indices, during the "August 19" period in Shanghai in 1947, prices rose 43 times, while prices in Taipei rose only 1.5 times. However, by the end of last year, prices in Shanghai had risen 120 times compared to the end of 1947, while prices in Taipei had also risen more than 12 times. It can be seen that the adjustment of the exchange rate of the Taiwan currency has gradually lost its effectiveness. The amount of Taiwan currency issued was only NT$5,330,593,000 from the Restoration to the end of 1946, but it had reached NT$14,819,912,000 by the end of 1947, and had increased to NT$89,085,725,000 by the end of 1948, not including the issuance of banknotes. The authorities are now working hard to contract the currency supply and step up production to avoid the disastrous consequences of hyperinflation in the Taiwan currency.</p>
<p>Taiwan Land Bank</p>
<p>At the beginning of Taiwan's Restoration, the government, in order to meet actual needs and realize banking specialization, established the bank in 1946 and took over all branches of the Industrial Bank of Japan in Taipei, Tainan, Taichung, Kaohsiung, and Hsinchu, reorganizing them into branches in their original locations. The total capital was NT$60 million, allocated by the national treasury at once. The head office is located in Taipei. The main tasks of the bank are to regulate land finance, capitalize land capital, so that fixed land and housing can obtain the necessary working capital, so that land can be fully utilized, especially focusing on rural areas to assist the government in implementing land policies; and to develop agriculture and forestry by directly assisting the development of agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry production projects through agricultural loans or investments.</p>
<p>Taiwan Industrial and Commercial Bank</p>
<p>The bank was originally named the Taiwan Commercial and Industrial Bank during the Japanese occupation period. After the Restoration, it was reorganized and renamed the Taiwan Industrial and Commercial Bank, and the capital was increased to NT$16 million, divided into 320,000 shares. It was jointly operated by the government and private individuals. The government subscribed to 180,601 shares, and the rest were private shares. In addition to vigorously absorbing floating capital, the bank also provides funds to small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises and also provides agricultural funds, so it has provided much support to local businesses. The bank's head office is located in Taipei, with a total of 27 branches and offices in the province.</p>
<p>Recent News from the University of Vienna</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Chinese students from various departments who went to Vienna to study last year in batches are studying at the University of Vienna and elsewhere. Recently, the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Vienna sent a letter to the Austrian Embassy in China, stating that the 18 students who applied for and were approved to participate in the winter registration on July 31, 1948, have been granted an extension to register on March 1, 1949 (spring) or October 1, 1949 (winter) due to various difficulties in entering and leaving the country. In addition, the school has degrees available for 25 more Chinese students, but there are no scholarships available.</p>
<h3>An Account of Grudges and Gratitude in the Greater Liang Mountains (Part II)</h3>
<p>"Intending to take his late father's pacification troops by force," this was Sun Fang's entire crime. When this decree was spread throughout the countryside and openly posted on the streets of Xichang, Sun Fang, in order to defend himself, when Deng Deliang's battalion entered to reinforce from Kangding, was wiped out by Sun Fang in Tuolang. Deng Deliang then marched on Xichang, ordering Chang Huwujiao to attack Luomuqie in Ningdong and Wazhaji to attack Nazhidayu in Hongmao to provide support. The two Yi leaders who were attacked were both members of the Yi ethnic sightseeing tour group. At the same time, Deng Deliang attacked Shachang, looting the family members and residences of Sun's officers. As a result, the situation in Xichang changed sharply, people were panicked, rumors spread, communications between Lugu and Xichang were cut off, and wild Yi people took advantage of the situation to loot. He Guoguang then hurriedly returned to Xichang from Chongqing at the end of last month to suppress the situation. The day before his departure, he told reporters, "The Yi people are very barbaric when they fight, burning, killing, and looting, doing everything. I want to try my best to resolve this issue peacefully."</p>
<p>He Guoguang has been back for half a month, but not a single piece of peaceful news has been heard from the Greater Liang Mountains. Presumably, he cannot "suppress" the situation. He, in anger, consulted with Liu Wenhui and obtained his consent to add the 136th Division of Liu's forces to deal with Deng Deliang. Local people, seeing that the situation was not good, repeatedly asked He to consider the achievements of the late Commander Deng Xiuting in governing the Yi people and to forgive the orphans. On April 2, He agreed to give Deng Deliang three days to repent.</p>
<p>Telegraph from Fellow Villagers of Xikang in Chongqing</p>
<p>However, to date, three days have passed, and what is the result? There is no news. The Xikang Fellow Villagers Association in Chongqing initially telegraphed General He Guoguang, urging him to resolve the issue peacefully to avoid devastation of the region. The day before yesterday, it suddenly telegraphed again, requesting the pacification office to dismiss and investigate Liu Wenhui. The evolution of the matter is truly extremely subtle. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>"To the Southwest Chief Executive's Office: Regarding the Sun-Deng dispute in Ning, this association, with pity for our homeland, telegraphed Pacification Commander He, earnestly requesting a peaceful resolution to avoid local devastation. To end the dispute, it seems appropriate to delineate the responsibilities of Sun and Deng, and jointly maintain local security to strengthen the rear. As for the Tianlu Rongbao civil unrest, according to generally credible rumors, it is the result of Kang Liu's subordinates and children disregarding the law, much like the Rongjing incident of the past. Generally, gentry are deeply dissatisfied with Liu's poisoning of Xikang, while the people are taking the risk and echoing each other, leading to a major change. To prevent future occurrences, it is proposed to dismiss and investigate Liu Wenhui and appoint an impartial official to preside over Kang's administration to pacify the frontier and stabilize the rear. The colleagues of this association remember the brethren of their hometown and cherish the tombs of their ancestors. We express our views impartially and without any grievances. We respectfully telegraph for your consideration. Xikang Province Fellow Villagers Association in Chongqing (38) Mao Zhen Yin."</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Xikang Fellow Villagers Association in Chongqing has been frequently visiting the door of Zhang Dulun, Secretary-General of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, hoping that Zhang can help with the peace in the Ning region because Zhang Dulun once served as the Director of the Xichang Pacification Headquarters and is also the "in-law" of General Deng Xiuting (Zhang's son, who died in a plane crash, married Deng's daughter). Half a month ago, someone saw Zhang Dulun writing to Liu Wenhui, begging him to withdraw his troops, presumably hoping that the 136th Division would not put too much pressure on his mother-in-law. With the rising voice of "Down with Liu" today, it seems that the crisis is lurking everywhere, and the situation seems to be getting more and more serious.</p>
<p>The Destruction of the Anti-Japanese Construction Reclamation Society</p>
<p>Currently, the Anti-Japanese Construction Reclamation Society in the Leima Pingbian area seized "Chunyan," causing a dispute between the Han and Yi people. The Yi people have destroyed the Anti-Japanese Construction Reclamation Society, and the residences of the reclaimers have been burned to ruins. Lv Zhenhua, the general manager of the Anti-Japanese Construction Reclamation Society, is trapped in Dahe. The Yi people continue to advance towards Pingshan County. On the other hand, the northeastern part of Yunnan Province has been controlled by the bandit army of Zhu Jiafeng and his ilk. If the internal disputes in the Ningjing Border Pacification Headquarters cannot be resolved reasonably, the forces suppressing the Yi people will instead become a fuse for inciting the Yi people to rebel. With the slightest carelessness, the entire border area of Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces may turn into a Han-Yi conflict. Uncivilized wild Yi people will take the opportunity to loot. The disturbance caused by these tens of thousands of savage Yi people, in this area where "defeated troops are frequently defeated, and generals are often sent on expeditions," even if Zhuge Liang were resurrected, it would not be possible to pacify it in one or two years.</p>
<p>As the manuscript was being written, good news came. He Guoguang has replied to the Xikang Fellow Villagers Association in Chongqing, stating that he is determined to resolve this dispute peacefully. The compatriots in the southwest, who have not been directly damaged by the long-term external and internal wars, are all earnestly hoping that this living "Account of Grudges and Gratitude in the Greater Liang Mountains" will end with good news.</p>
<h3>Fires of War and Smoke-Filled Lands: Where to Find Paradise? A Hong Kong Diary</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong, 3rd] Fires of war rage, and smoke fills the land. Anyone with a desire for life, wouldn't they want to find a paradise, to dream of "escaping the Qin"? Unfortunately, Tao Yuanming has been dead for over a thousand years. People yearn for a "Peach Blossom Spring," but where can they find such a "guide"?</p>
<p>If you feel that this place truly suits your current status, if you feel satisfied with everything here, then you should be proud that our ancestors had the foresight to give this place to the British Empire a hundred years ago, leaving a "paradise" for their descendants.</p>
<p>However, if you still have some Chinese blood in your veins, and if you haven't developed amnesia and forgotten your heritage, then when you come to this Chinese land ruled by foreigners, you should know that you are an expatriate. All the good and beautiful things, the paradise-like happiness given to you, are from those foreigners with high noses and yellow hair. One day, whenever they please, they can take back this thing you think is good, beautiful, and happy.</p>
<p>Then you might feel a bit lost again.</p>
<p>Perhaps you're very lucky, and the day you arrive in Hong Kong is a night.</p>
<p>At the end of the sea, you see myriads of lights, as dense as stars, seemingly suspended in the air. The lights illuminate the green strait, shimmering like ten thousand golden snakes, rushing towards your feet, welcoming you, the distinguished guest from afar.</p>
<p>What could be more beautiful than such a scene? You cheer, you imagine even more beautiful and lovely scenes on the shore. Perhaps your relatives, or your loved one, are waiting for you to embrace them warmly.</p>
<p>Have you read about relativity? Good luck is often followed by bad luck.</p>
<p>The ship's officer announced to your fellow travelers – all the passengers: "We cannot disembark today!"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"The colonial quarantine office hasn't come for inspection yet!"</p>
<p>"Why haven't they come?"</p>
<p>"It's past office hours, they're off work!"</p>
<p>"Shanghai issued a quarantine certificate, what else needs to be checked? If you don't trust Shanghai, why did Shanghai issue a certificate?" You complain a bit.</p>
<p>"These are British regulations, I don't know!" The officer is enforcing "British law," perhaps implying that he is already a "Britisher." Of course, you wouldn't believe it, because his nose isn't high, his hair isn't yellow, and especially those rat-like eyes almost dilute that bit of "British" air.</p>
<p>The towering foreign buildings, the flat, clean asphalt roads, the orderly cross-harbor ferries shuttling back and forth, the double-decker trams without the congestion of Shanghai, the readily available, beautiful, and luxurious "buses" that are even better than private cars, the magnificent, stable, and affordable "buses," and the elegant senior Chinese figures with a touch of British "eel-like" demeanor – all of this is unimaginable for those who have long lived in Shanghai and experienced all kinds of chaos, entanglements, suffocation, and terror.</p>
<p>However, that is only one side of Hong Kong. Have you seen the other side? Just like in the mainland, aren't those magnificent buildings and flat roads built upon the blood and sweat of millions of laborers? Out of 1.8 million people, how many live in Western-style houses? How many live in "wooden houses" that are even more rudimentary than those shacks in Pudong? How many don't even qualify to live in a wooden house? A few days ago, six thugs robbed a money exchange shop in the busiest downtown area, shooting and injuring three people. The Hong Kong government's reward for capturing the thugs changed three times in one day, from one thousand to five thousand, and from five thousand to ten thousand. But this is only because the incident occurred in the bustling city center. How many such robberies happen in more remote areas every day? If you visit a friend who has a bit of "influence," the doorman takes your business card from a small hole less than five inches square. After a long wait, only then does he open the door and invite you in. Then you will realize how people in this paradise live a cautious life, always being vigilant against the entry of "uninvited guests."</p>
<p>When you first arrive in Hong Kong, you will naturally have some desire to travel. Won't you come to Hong Kong to eat some seafood? Fish of unknown species wearing various colorful patterns, lobsters weighing three or four pounds, crabs almost as big as small washbasins, and fresh abalone, fresh scallops, countless and unrecognizable seafood, waiting for you to choose. Won't you go to Victoria Peak in Hong Kong to overlook the entire view of Hong Kong and Kowloon? The flagship of the British admiral, viewed from the mountain, is no different from the small ornaments in your home. However, you must be careful, whether it's a bus or a mountain cable car, it may encounter the patronage of thugs, causing you to return disappointed after going there in high spirits. Friends, you will feel that this overseas paradise is sometimes "difficult to move even an inch," right?</p>
<p>Where can you find a paradise in this world? After being in Hong Kong for forty-eight hours, you may sigh like this.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Rural Areas of Jiangnan</h3>
<p>Bad Spring Blossoms, Difficult Autumn Harvests</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] When price controls were lifted last year, after the appropriate autumn harvest, rice prices soared. Many rice merchants desperately purchased rice from rural areas at slightly higher prices. Farmers, shortsighted and lured by the current Gold Yuan Certificates, sold their rice one after another. By the time they had sold it, rice prices continued to rise, and their rice was almost completely gone. It was too late for regret. Currently, there are too many various taxes and levies imposed in the countryside, all standardized against the price of rice. Farmers, helpless, have to buy rice at high prices to pay off these levies and assessments. I once asked a large rice merchant in Hangzhou how much rice was left in the countryside. He said there was probably very little. His reason was that after price controls were lifted last year, farmers, seeing the good rice prices, sold their rice one after another and exchanged it for gold. Now, when the countryside needs rice, they exchange gold for rice. Based on this merchant's testimony, we can at least know that there is really very little rice left in the countryside.</p>
<p>With bad spring blossoms and difficult autumn harvests, and little rice left in the countryside, how will we cope with this year's crisis? Which is this year's unprecedented famine!</p>
<h3>Nightingale of the United Nations</h3>
<p>— Heralding</p>
<p>What makes the United Nations General Assembly most convenient for the attending representatives is the "translation breeze" set up in the venue. Without it, I don't know how much time the great organization devoted to the well-being of mankind would lose, and how much spiritual separation would be increased between these dozens of countries. Originally, if two nations or countries did not speak the same language, there was no way to talk about mutual understanding, and even unnecessary misunderstandings could arise as a result. But here, the scientists of the United Nations easily solved this important problem for us.</p>
<p>The first problem to be solved is the language problem. Although there are thousands of different languages in the world, only a few are commonly used in diplomacy, so there is no need to adapt to dialects from all over the world. Initially, only five languages were used in the United Nations meetings: Chinese, French, English, Soviet, and Spanish. Later, due to improvements in equipment and considering the convenience of the representatives of several small European countries, German and Italian were added in addition to the above five, which was almost sufficient.</p>
<p>Its equipment can be roughly divided into two periods. Initially, it could only translate the above five languages into English, and then transmit them to the representatives through loudspeakers or earphones. However, the English proficiency of representatives from all over the world was not necessarily good, so it was naturally easy to cause misunderstandings, so this method was soon abandoned.</p>
<p>Replaced by a novel new type of machine that is still in use today; whenever any representative speaks in the venue, the sound will be immediately picked up by the "microphone" installed in the venue, and then transmitted through a line to the ears of the translators sitting in a row of glass booths on the side of the venue. The efficiency of their work is truly amazing. Each of them must be able to understand the languages of seven countries and translate them fluently without hesitation. The speaker's speech is continuous, and their translated words are also continuous. Not only that, but each of them has some talent for speaking, and can express the central consciousness and tone of each representative's speech very appropriately. Everyone who has participated in the United Nations conference admires this skill immensely.</p>
<p>The voices of these seven interpreters are transmitted into seven microphones, then into seven amplifiers, and finally turned into radio waves, radiating from a copper wire around the ceiling using seven different wavelengths.</p>
<p>The receiver is even simpler, smaller than our ordinary camera, equipped with full receiving equipment and batteries, attached with a strap, which is the antenna, and does not need to be connected to anything. Representatives can hold it and listen while walking around. There is also a knob on it. No matter which country's representative stands up to speak, the listener only needs to turn its pointer to the language they can understand.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation Disputes Arise from Land Returns Without Written Records</h3>
<p>(Answered by Lawyer Jiang Pingfan)</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Zhongyi asks: Mr. A has seven mu of ancestral land. In 1937, due to a lack of people to cultivate it and owing two piculs of rent, he returned the land to the landlord. However, the landlord was momentarily confused and did not have him issue a land return receipt, and then immediately entrusted Mr. B to continue cultivating it. A year later, B no longer wanted to cultivate the land because it was not good. The landlord then entrusted Mr. C to cultivate it and issued a cultivation ticket. C has been cultivating and renting since 1939 for eleven years. Recently, A suddenly claimed land surface rights from C and forced him to stop cultivating. Please ask:</p>
<p>(1) Do C and A still have a relationship on the land surface? (2) Due to the return of rent and owed rent, does A still have land surface rights? (3) Is it valid not to have a written record at the time of the rent return? (4) Now that A is asking C to return the land surface, how should C deal with it? (5) After eleven years, A has not expressed any intention, and there were no words at the time of the initial rental. Can C directly reject it? (6) Is there any reason to refute the forced cessation of cultivation?</p>
<p>"Answer" (1) (2) C has been renting the land from the landlord and cultivating it for eleven years with a land ticket, so he should have obtained the right to rent the land. A and the landlord have already returned the rent, so there are no rights to speak of, and cannot claim rights on the grounds that the landlord did not take back the land ticket. (3) It is not necessary to have a written record at the time of the rent return. The fact that A has not cultivated for eleven years can prove it. (4) When A asks C to return the land surface, C can use the land ticket issued by the landlord to resist and reject it. (5) C can directly reject A's request. (6) If A forces the cessation of cultivation, he can be accused of hindering freedom.</p>
<h3>Clarification of School Enrollment Issues</h3>
<p>Education Bureau answers Mr. Jin Yongjian</p>
<p>Regarding whether there are any remedial measures for the enrollment of graduates from unapproved secondary schools. After investigation, Mr. Wang's graduating school was only approved to open and was not formally registered. All schools that are approved to open but have not completed registration procedures are still unregistered schools. The student's enrollment has not been reported to this bureau for record, so there is no record to verify. If Mr. Wang was admitted to the university based on equivalent qualifications, then there should be no problem with the university enrollment. If he was only admitted to the university with a certificate, there is no other way except to (1) participate in the screening and (2) wait for the college to complete registration before applying for retroactive recognition of the qualifications of graduates before registration.</p>
<h3>Customs Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>[Brief] (1) This column is published once a week, answered by the Jianghai Customs. (2) This column is limited to customs department issues that are related to the public. (3) Indicate Shenbao publication in the letter. (4) Mark "Customs Q&amp;A" on the envelope and send it to the Jianghai Customs, or forward it through this newspaper's social service column.</p>
<p>Mr. Gan Tijun asks: A used motorized bicycle, the tax payment certificate at the time of import cannot be found. Now I want to transport it to Guangzhou, can it be exempted from tax?</p>
<p>Answer: If you have a license issued by the Public Utilities Bureau, and the owner guarantees that it is indeed for personal use, it can be approved for tax-free re-export after verification by this customs.</p>
<p>Mr. Deng Qihan asks: Can passengers bring one or two pieces of clothing for personal use into the country from abroad without paying tax?</p>
<p>Answer: All new items brought in by passengers should be taxed.</p>
<p>Ms. Cheng Huifen asks: Is carrying traveler's checks abroad considered the same as foreign currency and subject to regulations?</p>
<p>Answer: There are no restrictions on carrying traveler's checks or other foreign currency checks abroad.</p>
