<h3>和平前途趨於黯淡　政府努力仍未鬆弛　張治中將先返迪化一行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕不絕如縷之和談希望，廿六日又因中共廣播所謂揭露「南京政府假和平陰謀」，而趨於黯淡，然政府對和平之努力，並未鬆弛。廿六日午前政院通過之請中共及早指定地點，推派代表開始談判之聲明，晚間仍照常發出，希望中共方面不再堅持己見，而以减少人民痛苦爲重，惟此間首要對中共連續兩日態度愈趨愈厲，要求愈來愈苛之廣播，顯已對和談前途發生憂慮。廿六日之廣播雖出以觀察家之方式，然若謂此種表示非中共要員之決定及授意，殊難令人相信，且其中指摘政府機關及資財之南遷，而加以揣想之解釋，以及要求扣留所謂重要戰犯，無異又於和談開始之前增加先決條件，亦似為中共當避側面透露其再進一步之企圖，如此將使和談之開始益趨困難，全國人民亦必感覺失望。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕政府發言人稱：政府爲提早結束戰爭，以减輕人民痛苦，一月以來，已作種種措施與步驟，本月廿二日更正式派定和談代表，日來祗待中共方面指派代表，約定地點，以便進行商談。惟據新華社陝北廿五日廣播中共發言人談話，一面雖聲明願與政府商談和平解決，一面則肆意侮謾，語多乘戾，且謂：「談判地點要待北平完全解放後，才能確定」。試問中共方面如不卽時指派代表，約定地點，又不停止軍事行動，而竟諉諸所謂北平完全解放以後，豈非拖延時間，延長戰禍。須知全國人民希望消弭戰禍，已屬迫不及待，政府爲表示絕大之誠意，仍盼中共認淸今日之事應以解救人民爲前提，從速指派代表，進行商談，使和平得以早日實現。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕政府和談代表邵力子·張治中兩氏曁李代總統私人代表甘介侯，爲奔走和平，徵詢各黨派人士之意見，曾先後赴滬，分別與各方會晤，頃已任務吿成，於卄六日分乘機·車返抵京。邵·張兩氏於上午九時半飛抵京後，卽赴總統府向李代總統報吿滬行經過，並交換關於廿五日晚中共廣播之態度，旋政務會議移於總統府舉行，並請邵力子等出席，報吿在滬與各方洽晤之經過詳情，當經會中提出討論，各委員相繼發言，對廿五日中共之廣播亦有所研討，旋決定應針對該項廣播發表聲明，說明政府態度，盼中共能及早提出和談時間地點與代表，早日促成和談，其餘各項細節，則交和談代表團集會商討。下午四時孫科院長在其政院一號官邸邀集和談代表邵力子·張治中·鍾天心及其他政委等舉行首次代表團會議，討論該團出發之問題及準備事宜，聞該團行期已爲中共連日之廣播所阻止，顯不能在一二日內成行，惟謀和甚切之內閣，對準備工作，則並未因而消極。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕正在首都奔走和平之政委張治中，因新省要公待辦，定一二日內抽暇飛迪化一行，處理有關新省外交事務，三數日卽返京，對和談之進行，將不致有所影響。另悉：新省府自改組後，在新省地方性之對蘇外交，頗多開展。</p>
<h3>陜北中共電台　昨晚冗長廣播　某外籍觀察家認和談已棘手</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕昨日（廿六）下午六時陝北中共電台有冗長之廣播，其要點略誚：『中國第二名「戰犯」美國傀儡李宗仁及南京其他偽裝主和的人們，現在在口頭上聲明承認中國共產黨提出的八項條件，但這聲明是眞的嗎？邵力子。張治中正在放布對於八項條件的荒謬曲解。邵·張關於「懲辦戰犯」的表示，以爲蔣已引退，政府刻正等待共方表明對於戰犯名單上其他四十二名戰犯的意圖。他們這些似和平的陰謀家以爲將旣離京，就算是「懲辦戰犯」，其實這不過是放縱「戰犯」罷了。現在南京李宗仁政府及其合作者有一個方法證明他們有無和平誠意，這就是把蔣介石，宋子文，谷正綱，陳誠，何應欽，顧祝同，劉峙，湯恩伯，張羣，王世杰，朱家驊，劉健羣，吳國楨，潘公展，蔣經國，張君勵，左舜生，戴傳賢，鄭介民，葉秀峯等一大批首要「戰犯」，立卽加以扣留，並將國外戰犯緝拿歸案。陝北觀察家更認爲「僞代總統」李宗仁和「僞行政院長」孫科本人，都是車要戰犯，張治中·邵力子也都是擁護蔣做「僞總統」的可愛的人物，想要靠弄花樣是徒然的。只有他們實在執行八項條件中的第一條的第一步，卽將戰犯加以扣留，交給人民政府審判，他們才有將功贖罪的可能」。記者就上項廣播，徵詢有權威之某外國觀察家的意見。據答：若照此推測，中共顯已得寸進尺，企圖壓迫李代總統及孫院長作無條件的投降，甚至連最熱心奔走和平的「和平老人」邵力子和「和平將軍」張治中亦在侮辱之列，實在不可想像。吾人旁觀者原以爲政府確已盡力表示其尋求和平之高度誠意，李代總統及白總司令崇禧先後表示願就中共之八項條件開始商談，並先推派代表，只候中共答復卽可啓程。詎料中共專就「戰犯」一點大做文章，又將毛澤東廣播所謂以八條爲和談基礎者擱在一邊，使李代總統大感棘手。此一外國觀察家並謂，今天中共尙未正式控制政府，而目竟已如此，他日聯合政府組成，當更可想見。大槪中共今日已自視爲完全戰勝者，欲以「受降」之姿態，出現於南京李代總統之前，而受降以後則更繼之以審判戰犯，彷彿中國政府今日之審判岡村寗次一般。故事實上，今日中國大局已非和不和的問題，而爲李代總統之國民政府降不降的問題。</p>
<h3>對國內和平問題朱家驊發表意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕中央研究院院長朱家驊氏，頃對和平問題發表意見稱：和平自爲人人所蘄求，但和平的眞諦，乃繫於雙方相互尊重，相忍相讓，而不是一方投降他方之謂，這樣纔能消除仇恨，而免除循環報復，然後方得長治久安，不然勉强茍安一時，亦必遺禍將來，第恐國家社會和民族前途，乃至人類，均將不堪設想。近來毛澤東的聲明，和李濟琛等五十五人對時局的意見，都把這次的問題，看做國內的事，這樣應該一切都易解決，可惜他們所說的種種，性質上竟是國際戰爭中最苛刻的條件，這頗令人費解。因爲如此，則國家民族的獨立和自主，人權和民主生活方式的保障，以及文化思想，學術的自由，均不知從何談起，於此可見問題的嚴重，前途困難尙多，更有待於我人的積極努力，以期眞正的和平得以實現，方可吿無愧於後代。</p>
<h3>彭昭賢談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕彭昭賢氏昨對外傳渠堅辭和談代表事，發表談話稱：「此誠一滑稽之事，和平爲全國人民所迫切要求者，余亦深願爲此而努力，此次政府任命本人爲和談代表之一，事前雖未獲悉，發表後己未嘗發表言辭，連日報載一再辭職之消息，不知從何而來。今見報載新華社廣播後，本人對代表一席，則應加以考慮，爲促進和談順利進行起見，已請邵·張兩代表轉請政府，另覓適當人選，至有謂本人係代表某系派參加之說，尤屬無稽，因平日對派系問題，向不感興趣。」</p>
<h3>教授和策會人士　擬飛平相機進行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕京各大學敎授所組成之和平策進會人士，爲奔走和平，擬卽飛平，相機進行。該會孫裕復等廿六日訪政府和談代表鍾天心，請政府能予交通工具上之便利，以便成行，聞接洽結果甚爲圓滿。</p>
<h3>川康渝聯合應變　傳人事將予調整</h3>
<p>〔本報成都廿六日電〕川康渝聯合應變，王陵基今訪劉文輝，作具體商討，並歡迎張羣蒞蓉，否則兩氏卽赴渝候張，商川康大計。此間盛傳劉氏將調任川主席王氏調長渝市，楊森專治軍事，賀國光任康省主席說。</p>
<h3>江蘇省政府　決定遷蘇州</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿六日電〕蘇省府爲積極應變，已決定全部遷蘇州，並疏散百分之七十公務員赴蘇，留百分卅駐鎭辦公，各廳處局定廿七日起開始啓程。聞丁主席爲鎭壓省會人心，暫不赴蘇。</p>
<h3>李代總統　分電軍政首長　勉各安職守　並希陳述意見俾供採擇</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕李代總統廿六日分電各軍政長官，各省主席，各特別市長，各綏靖主任，各綏區司令官云：「總統蔣公爲體念國家之艱危，顧恤人民之痛苦，決然引退，以促和平早日實現，宗仁依據憲法第四十九條之規定，執行總統職權，業於一月廿二日到府視事，現値時局嚴重，尙望各地軍政首長各安職守，同心一德，戮力共赴，卓見所及，並希隨時陳述意見，俾供採擇，爲盼，李宗仁一月廿六日機印」。</p>
<h3>國軍固守滁河南岸　共軍侵入儀徴圖試探渡江登陸未逞　李延年司令官坐鎭浦鎭</h3>
<p>〔本報涌鎭廿六日電〕迄廿六日晚十一時止，津浦南段國軍迄仍固守滁河南岸，北岸東西葛且尙有國軍前衛部隊，李延年兵團司令迄仍在浦鎭坐鎭，外傳共軍已進駐浦鎭絕對不確。</p>
<p>〔本報浦鎭廿六日電〕自國軍於滁河南岸完成周密部署，並構成長江北岸最堅强的橋頭堡，藉以拱衛首都門戶後，南京下關曁兩浦一帶人心已趨安定。廿六日烏衣方面共軍江淮獨立旅雖向滁河北岸西葛國軍前進陣地繼續來擾，但俱經楊幹才軍全部擊退。</p>
<p>〔本報浦鎭廿六日電〕共軍二千餘，於廿五日午後侵入儀徵後，當夜嘗以約五六十人之小股，利用民船，經由城東南之禮祀洲，企圖在高資附近江面作試探性登陸，經南岸國軍發現後，已予掃數驅逐。現儀徵西南要點大河口尙在國軍某營固守中。</p>
<p>〔本報常熟廿六日電〕此間沿江防務，經調派大軍駐守後，固若金湯，十二圩港一帶公路已漏夜搶修工竣，福山·滸浦等港，三十噸以下之船隻陸續向指定地點疏散，其餘仍停泊原處待命。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿六日電〕此間長江沿岸今日甚少軍事活動，京浦間輪渡忙碌，往來乘客擁擠如常。步兵一批排列江邊，等待北上。共軍聞已包圍浦鎭，但未遮斷長江航運。今日抵京之漢口輪船，沿途亦無意外。首都局勢雖仍緊張，秩序尙佳。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿六日電〕政府要負今日吿聯合社記者稱，和談如果失敗，政府將放棄長江流域而堅守南面之新防棧，繼續作戰。萬一共方要求之和平代價太高，京滬兩地殆將不戰而降。該項新防綫業已準備就緒，自杭州附近海港西南沿錢塘江至南昌，再從南昌向西北以迄武昌。過去數日間已有大批國軍奉命南調，國防部亦將在二十八日前全部撤退，僅餘警備司令部繼續留京。爲預防和談失敗計，國軍最後新戰略將劃分全國爲三大集團，東南集團歸李宗仁統率，西南集團由白崇禧管理，西北集團包括馬鴻逵與馬步芳部，悉屬胡宗南指揮。至於台灣則將併入東南集團。但此間軍事觀察家僉認政府利用現有軍隊恐難堅守新防綫數個月之久，因政府在徐州一役已喪失大部份配備精良之國軍，目前除白崇禧與廣州方面少數部隊外，多係毫無作戰經騐之新兵。</p>
<p>六迂前綫巡視</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿六日電〕記者廿六日晨與輪渡辦事處主任孫奇峯，乘專艇往六圩前綫巡視，目睹駐軍正在午餐，精神極佳。晨間七時許，最前綫施家橋雙方曾發生斥堠戰，惟互發一二槍即吿停止，該地僅有共軍便衣隊三五人留守。現六圩·瓜洲·十二圩一帶沿江岸地區實施封鎖，駐軍已建有堅强之橋頭堡甚多，正嚴陣以待。鎭圩間因軍運需要，輪渡仍不規則開行，六圩方面經常泊有四條輪船，六條拖船，升火待發，以備軍用·江北揚州·高郵·泰縣·泰興·淮陰·淮安等地難民仍絡續南來，經長途跋涉，面容極爲憔悴。又，海軍砲艇之惠安·聯珠兩艦，除日夜巡弋江面外，夜間更不斷在沿江北岸，以探海燈照射，下午三時，空軍機兩架，並沿揚圩公路低飛甚久。此間預料共軍一時尙無南進企圖，人心鎭定。</p>
<p>京滬行車無虞</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕自江北六合·儀徵·揚州等地國軍相繼撤守後，外間各界對京滬路今後行車安全頗爲關注。記者爲此特訪某軍事觀察家，據吿，國軍對江北沿江若干要點之所以繼續撤退，一方固爲藉此節省兵力，以加强長江南岸之防務力量，一方亦所以表示政府對和談之誠意與決心，至江北沿江若干要點之放棄，其中尤其是儀徵，該處江面雖狹，如共軍以重砲向江南射擊，雖可能予鐵路行車若干威脅，藉以確壞交通綫，然其影響至微，過去抗戰期間，隴海路西段潼關附近，固無時不在黃河北岸風陵渡日軍炮火有效射程內，以描準準確如日本胞兵，我人固未聞有若干火車被化轟燬也。</p>
<h3>通如間商電中斷　傳如國軍撤守</h3>
<p>〔本報南通廿六日電〕此間與如皋之商電連絡中斷，盛傳國軍業已撤守，但軍方未證實。又靖江電訊亦斷。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕江陰對江之靖江，廿四日夜起已被共軍千餘包圍，迄廿五日黃昏，雖仍由國軍固守，但情勢顯已極端嚴重。</p>
<h3>蕪湖城防指揮部　勸市民遷安全區</h3>
<p>〔本報蕪湖廿六日電〕蕪湖城防指揮部為蕪湖將面臨戰爭，勸吿市民遷居安全地區，以避無謂犧牲。戒嚴令依然繼續執行，待共軍軍事行動停止後始恢復解嚴。</p>
<h3>張學良準備下山　惟釋放命令現仍未到台　楊森對釋楊虎城事報綏署辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報台北廿六日電〕中央釋放張學良命令現仍未到，莫德惠亦未抵此，惟張氏已悉此項消息，正作下山準備，預料本週內可先來台北。此二年內張氏居新竹縣之井上溫泉，除不能離山外，餘均極自由，起居亦安適，健康情形甚佳。　〔中央社本市訊〕莫德惠稱：渠將於二三日內赴合灣，訪問張學良氏，交換對時局之意見。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿六日電〕此間東北同鄕電張學良慰問。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿六日電〕楊森今奉釋放楊虎城電，渠卽轉報綏署處置，截下午四時止，記者仍無法與楊虎城晤面。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿六日電〕于右任今與楊森通長途電話，探詢楊虎城情况。另據空軍司令晏玉琮下午五時吿記者，尙未接總部派機載楊虎城飛京電示。又市府秘書長李寰今曾持京電赴綏署，與廖楷陶秘書長商談良久。</p>

<h3>社論　從開展世界落後區域說起</h3>
<p>美國對於開發世界落後區域，杜魯門總統刻正在起草一項「果敢的新計劃」，將以十億美元貸與世界落後各國，與其自訂的開發資源計劃，相輔而行，這個新計劃的內容如何，目前尚不可知；但據聯合社華盛頓廿二日電稱，美國官員談稱：此項新計劃，需要美國政府，國際銀行，美國私人資本暨受助各國四方面的協力進行；其性質與馬歇爾的援外計劃，截然不同，貸與各國的美元，將來必須歸還。同時，英國外相貝文，對於美國杜魯門總統開發世界落後區域的新計劃，首先表示熱烈贊成，他說：「我們歡迎杜魯門總統的保證，謂美國將以其所有的富源與技術來保衛西方文化」。又說：「對共產主義的答覆，乃在獲致良好的生活水準，得享快樂，與西方世界配合。」</p>
<p>杜魯門總統對於此項新計劃的真正意向，目前雖然還不能完全明瞭，但是杜魯門總統將揚棄「馬歇爾計劃」而改採純經濟性的新計劃，是可以斷言的。準此而論，美蘇兩國間所從事的「冷戰」，今後或可望漸趨於和緩；眼前雖無跡象足資微信，而且事實恰巧正相反，蘇聯為集中其東歐衛星國的資源和力量起見，已替東歐鐵幕內的六國，擬定了一個蘇聯式的「馬歇爾計劃」，將設立「東歐經濟及互助委員會」，俾與美國所發動的歐洲復興計劃，爭一日之短長。但在我們看來，兩種不同的經濟制度，儘量作經濟上的競爭，終比較「冷戰」好很多，至少沒有火藥氣味。</p>
<p>最近國際上有兩件大事，是值得我們特別重視的，一為英波貿易協定於本月十四日在華沙簽字成立，規定兩國的貿易總額，達兩億六千萬英鎊之多，為期達五年之久；波蘭以雞蛋，滷肉·木材供給英國，而英國則以羊毛，橡膠，石油及工業設備輸入波蘭。英波兩國關係由此好轉，將為顯而易見的事實。這個協定不僅促進兩國的貿易，而且也扭轉了兩國的經濟關係。聞英國已解凍了波蘭政府的在英存款五億英鎊，波蘭政府也已承認了戰前她對英國所有的債務。此事更足以說明歐洲的不可分性，儘管波蘭在赤色鐵幕之內，儘管「冷戰」愈演愈烈，但仍不能阻隔了英國與波蘭的往來貿易。其次是南國的對外貿易，對美輸出逐漸增加，而與東歐各國的商務關係，漸趨疏淡。自去年十二月南國總理狄托決定與西方通商之後，南國已以其銅，鉛，銻以及水銀等非含鐵金屬輸往美國，總值達三，六七六，〇〇〇美元之鉅，今後自當有增無減。而南蘇兩國一九四九年貿易協定的數額，却僅及去年貿易總額的八分之一；同時，南國對波蘭的貿易，也在逐漸減少之中。所以，蘇聯也沒有把南國列入東歐經濟及互助委員會之內。這一事實，更足以說明，人類經濟關係的發展是自然的，決非任何政治勢力所能阻隔。</p>
<p>公平的互助性的經濟援助，不論站在那一個立場，必為世界各國所一致歡迎。所以，我們可以假定，杜魯門總統對於開發落後區域擬訂的新計劃，如果完全是一種公平的互助性的經濟援助，而不帶有別種作用和企圖，則其必能促成世界普遍性的繁榮，使大多數人民均能享受物資的幸福，而在美國本身而論，更加沒有發生經濟恐慌之虞了。貝文外相說，「良好的生活水準是對共產主義最好的答覆」，即使美國仍堅持反對共產主義，仍要阻制共產勢力的向外發展，這也是走向和平繁榮的康莊大道。我們希望杜魯門總統的和平努力，能向着這個和平繁榮的大路邁進。</p>
<h3>故都局勢無進展　小隊共軍初次出現街頭　綏遠自昨日起宣布停戰</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕（一）聯合辦事處機構人員傅作義已決定派郭仲正·周北峯·秦豐川三人參加。（二）離代總統代表劉仲華，擬經由傅作義鄧賓珊之媒介，與共方人士作非正式接觸，正接洽中。（三）綏遠問題雙方僅同意暫時休戰，共方盼倣北平辦法，傅氏則主張留待與全面和平合併解決，故尚無具體決定。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕平局勢無進展，國軍出城時仍有枝節，尚待繼續疏解。共軍今日仍未入城，聯合機構亦未成立，惟該機構國軍方面代表已定郭宗汾，周北峯，秦鳳川。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕綏遠戰事已告結束，雙方廿六日起宣布停戰，其他軍政接交問題正商洽中。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿六日電〕今日城內大街今有小隊共軍初次公開出現，沿途人民與政府士兵對之甚為注目，彼等旅赴商店購物，並以人民票付款。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿六日電〕此間廿六日預測將有大規模軍事調動，顯然此為全部佔領北平步驟之信號。武裝整齊之兵士三百人，在青天白日滿地紅大旗前導下，沿城中主街行經記者寓所。三百人中竟無人帽上綴有青天白日章，按此為國共兩軍之唯一區別。記者出迎衆士兵，並詢以何往，彼等僅微笑示答。兩旁觀衆及記者均以為彼等係共軍，然某高級官員在電話中否認共軍已入城。中國報界稱：葉劍英將任市長兼北平軍事委員會主席，林彪已被任為平津區總司令，聶榮臻則為平津警備司令。葉劍英將為北平聯合市府之主角。</p>
<p>聯合政權之遲遲未見成立，傳係國軍未依指定時間撤往城外之故。事實上，一切重武器，軍火及其他供應品傳已集中待移交，街道中所見士兵僅携有輕武器。結束華北國軍據點之籌備工作之進行如火如荼。傳閻錫山已傳駐平代表邀第三方面出為魯仲連。事實上，數月來不斷聞閻氏已與中共接觸談和，自平飛綏遠之傅作義代表聞已完成歸綏·包頭·大同及其他孤立傳部據點之和平措施。現旅平山西法學院長廿五日致電閻氏，痛斥渠反動及行同暴君。電文內容由平市各報照登。平市報紙日益左傾，以邀中共之歡心，故大字刊登中共電台攻擊南京政局之全文。冀主席楚溪春證實李濟琛一二日內可來平。石家莊之新政協亦排日有新聞報導。</p>

<h3>北平停戰後　金鈔銀元　交易活躍　價格兔起鶻落</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿六日電〕共方貨幣雖已在北平城外自由流通，但城內尚未見面。本月廿二日停戰以來，市內美鈔，金條與銀元交易熱鬧，價格上落甚巨，金條與銀元之交易較美鈔更為活躍。茲將連日美鈔，銀元與黃金價格漲落開列如下（單位金圓券）：</p>
<p>美鈔（每元）</p>
<p>最高價　最低價</p>
<p>廿二日　三五〇　二五〇</p>
<p>廿三日　二四〇　一七〇</p>
<p>廿四日　二五〇　二〇〇</p>
<p>廿五日　三一五　二七〇</p>
<p>銀元（每元）</p>
<p>最高價　最低價</p>
<p>廿二日　四〇〇　三五〇</p>
<p>廿三日　三〇〇　二〇〇</p>
<p>廿四日　四〇〇　二六〇</p>
<p>廿五日　三六〇　三四〇</p>
<p>黃金（每兩）</p>
<p>最高價　最低價</p>
<p>廿二日　二五五〇〇　二二五〇〇</p>
<p>廿三日　一四五〇〇　一二〇〇〇</p>
<p>廿四日　一七五〇〇　一四五〇〇</p>
<p>廿五日　二四五〇〇　二一〇〇〇</p>
<p>黃金與美元之比價，廿二日，廿三日均為每兩六十五美元，廿四日最高七十二元，最低七十元，廿五日最高七十五元，最低六十八元。</p>
<p>金圓券對金銀之價格，兔起鶻落，由於謠言揣測未來共幣對金圓券之兌換所致。共幣種類甚多，價值不一。據來平旅客稱，共方規定金圓券八元換人民銀行券一元，人民銀行券八十元換銀元一元，果爾，則銀元一元即值金圓券六百四十元。此種兌換率大約亦為臨時性質。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕平物價連日猛升，今日麵粉一六〇〇元一袋，豬肉三八〇元一斤，黃金二四五〇〇元，銀元五二〇元。</p>

<p>〔本報漢口廿六日電〕此間謠諑紛起，黑市金銀與日用百貨今仍競相猛漲，銀元已叩三百大關，柴米油布等物價一律較昨漲一倍左右。又，漢口央行自滬運到黃金八百兩，月前所發存兌申請書，今已開始照兌。</p>

<h3>平津所存美援物資　經合署仍擬配售　醫藥品一批由滬運抵平</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕經濟合作總署中國司令長克里扶蘭今日宣稱：總署正在結算北平與天津兩地現存美援物資數量，將運貨帳目與駐華分署最近報告作一比較。駐華分署最近報告謂平津兩地尚有美援小麥，麵粉及紗布值約四百萬元，此數似乎太高。總署仍擬對中國人民繼續辦理配給，至少以用罄在華物資為度。但將來措施牽涉政治方面，當由國務院決定。繼續配給乃依照已定政策，至於中共控制區運用美援物資將受最嚴格限制，必須說明此種物資來自美國，且分署得派員視察其運用情形。自共軍佔領北平後，總署迄未接到駐平代表台維斯報告，或因該地陷落時發生混亂所致，駐天津代表艾維則幾乎每日來電報告。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿六日電〕經合總署駐華分署今日包中航專機一架滿載醫藥品，自上海經青島抵此，將交由中國醫師分發予各醫院。該機係由美籍機師駕駛，上無中航標誌。運來之醫藥品大部份為配尼西林與硫化藥品。</p>

<h3>美駐滬總領葛柏德發表演說　駁斥中共反美論調</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處上海二十六日訊〕美國駐滬總領事葛柏德，在美國大學俱樂部發表演說，全文如次：</p>
<p>最近報紙上時常刊載的一位中國政治領袖，他於一月十四日曾發表聲明，你們都已讀過了嗎？現在讓我把裏面摘要奉告諸位：</p>
<p>「自一九四六年七月，南京國民黨反動政府，在美國帝國主義者的幫助之下，違背人民意旨，撕毀停戰協定，發動全國規模的反革命內戰以來，業已兩年有半；在這兩年半戰爭中，南京國民黨政府違背民意，出賣國家利益給美國，勾引美國的海軍空軍，佔據中國的領海領空，簽訂大批的賣國條約，勾引美國軍事顧問團參加內戰，自美國得到飛機，大砲，步槍，砲彈以及一切軍用物資，用來屠殺人民。」</p>
<p>在這時候，那位政治領袖停止攻擊美國帝國主義，也許是因為他已經是講得透不過氣來，雖然後來他又特別指出廢除賣國條約是和談的條件之一。</p>
<p>鑒於過去兩年半中美國政府在中國所做的一切，這一聲明，的確是一個很嚴厲的控訴，而且它儘是陝北電台所講的一部份而已。中國的愛國人仕以及這裏的美國良善公民，當然要知道美國政府到底有沒有這種萬惡的行為？這裏是一個大學的集會，而正因為學術自由是大學具應備的信念，所以諸位更要知道其中的真相。現在讓我們看一看以往的記錄：</p>
<p>民意在那裏？怎會知道的？</p>
<p>我所指的這位貴領袖，似乎是缺少事實而長於肆意抨擊。就前者而言，我們也許可以補充一點。</p>
<p>在我所引述的短短摘要中，該項聲明兩次提及「民意」兩字，這必定是對中國民意而言，但是我很懷疑它怎樣會知道他們的意思是什麽？在美國，我們很容易知道民意是什麽－而我並不是指民意測騐而言。舉一個例子，我們知道美國人民要推杜魯門做總統。</p>
<p>我們知道獲得勞工支持的不是華萊士而是杜魯門。一般人認為：華爾街銀行家是反對杜魯門當選的，而這輩銀行家是陝北電台最喜歡加以斥責的。因此，我們可以相當確定：當杜魯門先生的政府贊助對中國國民政府加以援助時，這是美國人民的意思，而不是華爾街銀行家要這樣做。但是就我所引述的著名政治領袖而言，他是否具有同樣的方法去探悉中國的民意呢？中共有沒有在他們的控制區內舉行自由選舉呢？任何一個共特政權，它是否曾舉行自由選舉呢？抑或是在任何國家內經由自由選舉而執政呢？捷克·匈牙利以及十數其他民族，也許都願意對此提出證明。在他們沒有指斥美國違反中國民意之前，請中共在自由選舉中自中國人民那裏獲取委任。</p>
<p>中國國家主義美國小心尊重</p>
<p>聲明內又提到中國國家主權完全出賣給美國政府的話。在缺乏更特別指出的罪名之時，這個罪名有一點像「你可曾停止毆打你的老婆」的舊笑話。（譯者按：美國有一個流行的笑話：一個律師向被告曰：「你已停止毆打你的太太了嗎」？這個問題問得非常巧妙，因為無論被告的答覆是：「已經停止」或是「還沒有」，他已經承認曾經打過他的太太了。簡言之，葛氏認為中共的控訴過於空洞，令人無法置答。）但也許這不過是以後各種罪狀的引言。雖然如此，讓我說：美國是小心尊重中國的主權的，美國不願請求中國政府或任何其他政府出賣國家的權利。我們並不想在中國對中國人或任何其他人民，取得任何特權的地位。</p>
<p>次一個項目比較具體一點：說國民政府「向美國政府借得外債數十億美元」。可是奇怪的是：自一九四六年七月以來，美國從未借過一塊錢給中國政府；反之，我們對於建議中的進出口銀行五億美元的放款，也拒絕繼續。甚至共黨的宣傳也說我們自對日勝利日以來的對華援助，只有四億美元，這本身是一個很膨脹的數字，其中大半是不要償還的。關於我們的援助協定，我馬上就要講起。</p>
<p>誰侵犯主權？請看大連旅順</p>
<p>在詳單中次一個項目是：「它促使美政府的海軍和空軍佔領中國的領土和領海，並侵犯中國的領空主權。」共黨難道已忘了這些軍隊的來到中國，是幫助中國從日軍手中解放它的領土嗎？他們（共黨）難道以為這些軍隊將留駐在中國，較之公認的中國當局所願意他們留駐的時期更長麼？而且，我們願意聽聽中共對於有一個外國佔領大連一事，採取何種立場？還有，他們難道也承認目前旅順的地位嗎？我們雖同意中共關於帝國主義罪惡的說法，但我們感覺他們草就應該注意到上面所講的那些情形。其實在那方面的外國軍隊却似乎將永遠駐在中國的土地上。（下接第四版）</p>

<h3>美對華政策不變　並維持美兩黨外交政策　艾契遜在首次記者會中宣布</h3>

<h3>中日印最近三木事件　將影響西方政策　使世界對兩大勢力</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕亞洲發生之三大事件，卽中國和平談判之　　，日本之普選，及新德里之亞洲會議，使舉世目光集中東亞，同時足以澄淸西半球人民應取之立塲，俾在彼等所遭通之國家主義與共產主義兩大勢力之間，有所抉擇。中國方面國民黨在軍事上失敗後，對於局勢日見無法控制，其和平要求事實上已遭勝利之共黨拒絕，共黨顯然僅願與國民黨政治獨占時期之反對分子或在國民政府失敗前卽已分離之分子商談。共黨與「民主同盟」問正在進行中之聯合，日益顯然，將在中國建立類似東歐「人民民主」政府之政權，此種政機在觀念上與事實上均由共黨控制。此項前瞻，將在中國與西方國家今後之關係中構成長期之問題及同樣複雜之現實問題。所謂長期之問題，爲中國之人民民主政府對於州莫斯科之後台，是否將如外蒙古或羅馬尼亞等之絕對忠誠，抑如南斯拉夫之趨向國家主義，當前之問題涉及此次中國新革命在國際會議中行將產生之後果。中國在此等會議中爲名列第五之「强國」，尤以安理會與東京之明國管制委員會中爲然。此間有資格之觀察家相信，在盟國管制委員會中此項問題尤其尖銳，其中由共黨控制之中國，若經常採取支持蘇聯觀點之行動，可使麥克阿瑟將軍之計劃大受打擊。日本選舉之結果具有兩種因素，可能使兩個對日戰勝國家卽美蘇問之裂痕，益見增加。其一爲中間政黨之慘敗，與極右派保守政黨之勝利，極右派政黨無疑認爲美國係對抗蘇聯勢力十最佳保障，其二爲共黨之成功。按共黨在中國之勝利，對於此項結果當有貢獻。由於此次選舉而成立之新政府，將益使日本成爲遠東抵抗共黨及蘇聯勢力之堡壘，因美國顯然將使中國及朝鮮聽天由命也。另外一個基礎不同之抵抗中心（代表國家主義「第三種勢力」其中並無共黨參加）似以印度爲中心，現正在形成之中。印度自獲得獨立後，卽顯然切望採取中庸之立塲，並成爲亞洲强國集團之中心，由印度發起之新德里會議，以採取中庸立塲見稱，該會主旨在將精神上之支持，給予印尼非共黨之國家主義。越南共產黨之越盟與中亞細亞之蘇聯各共和國均未被邀請，與會之國家着重使彼等之決議符合聯合國憲章之原則，並避免使彼等之討論具有「反對西方國家陰謀」之景象，因此亞洲國家主義與共產主義間之分野，日益明顯，共產主義曾企圖利用此項國家主義而爲其本身牟利，此間消息靈通人士，認爲對於上項事實之認識，可日益影響西方國家在亞洲所採之政策。</p>
<h3>羅雅爾明日赴日　行前特晉謁杜魯門總統　抵日後將先與麥帥會唔</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕陸軍部長羅雅爾廿五日伴同參謀長勃萊特雷將軍謁杜魯門總統商談。事後羅氏吿記者稱，渠與總統討論渠之赴日視察事。渠稱，此次赴日將電短期的，與最近赴德國者相似。渠稱，渠將與麥克阿瑟將軍討論軍政府及經濟事件。</p>
<p>問及渠對日本普選有何感想，答稱，渠知麥帥甚感滿意，整個言之，渠認爲普選結果甚爲有利，因政府將有大多數黨支持也。羅氏稱，渠將於廿八日起程，路經阿拉斯加，由阿拉斯加去東京，冲繩島，關島及夏威夷，於二月十五日返回華府，渠稱，與麥帥之會晤，將談及有「相互利益之各事」。渠不願多加透露。羅部長當自白宮走出時，僅作簡短評述，問及對駐東京記者是否將有何新指令，渠稱，毫無所知。</p>
<h3>赴日本旅客　須繳出外幣</h3>
<p>離日者不准携日元出境</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿六日電〕麥帥今日命日政府修正關於旅客携帶外幣出入日本條例。新命令規定來日旅客應繳出外幣，持有美鈔者依一對二七〇比率兌換日元，或逕將外幣存入外商銀行。外幣與美鈔倘不兌換亦不存儲，則當由日本銀行代爲保管，俟旅客出境時發還，支票與匯兌不在此限，除非爲日本人携入老，出境旅客得携帶來日時所有外幣及麥帥總部听核准之美鈔，但不得地帶日元出境。</p>

<h3>以色列普選初步揭曉　古利翁業已佔先　共黨在議席中不致超五席</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社台拉維夫廿六日電〕以色列舉行普選後，陸軍所投之票雖則須至廿八日始能檢點淸楚，而最後結果始能發表，然今晨投票結果，以色列總理古利翁領導下之馬伯然獲得甚大之勝利，已可判明，古利翁在以色列全國皆佔優勢，各反對黨恐難希望獲得甚多之票數。特別感到失望者，係以色列之共黨人士，渠等恐將不能在以色列一百廿名國會議負中當選四五席以上，右翼之齊魯特黨，亦難達到渠等預定之目標，現被禁於監獄中待判之史特恩團重要候選人葉林，恐係該團能入國會之唯一代表。</p>

<h3>日本駐華派遣軍總司令　岡村寧次宣判無罪　退庭後增請晉謁庭長致謝遭拒絕　還押監獄俟報中樞核定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前日本駐華派遣軍總司令岡村寗次大將被訴戰犯一案，業於昨日經國防部軍事法庭提岡村再審後宣判無罪。判決書主文：「岡村寗次無罪」，其理由稱「按戰爭罪犯之成立，係以在作戰期間，肆施屠殺强姦搶劫等暴行，或違反國際公約計劃陰謀發動，或支持侵略戰爭爲要件，並非一經參加作戰，卽應認爲戰犯，此觀於國際公法及我國戰爭罪犯審判條例第二第三各條之規定，至爲明顯。本案被吿於民國三十三年十一月二十六日，受日軍統帥之命，充任中國派遣軍總司令官，所有長沙徐州各大會戰日軍之暴行，以及酒井隆在港粵·松井石根谷壽夫等在南京之大屠殺，均係發生於被吿任期之前，原與被吿無涉。（酒井隆谷壽夫業經本庭判處死刑，先後執行在案。）且當時盟軍已在歐州諾曼第及太平洋塞班島先後登陸，軸心旣形瓦解，日軍陷於孤立，故自被吿受侖之日，以迄日本投降時止，閱時八月，所有散駐我國各地之日軍，多因鬥志消沉，鮮有進展，迨日本政府正式宣吿投降，該被吿乃息戈就範，率百萬大軍，聽侖納降。跡其所爲，旣無上述之屠殺强姦搶劫，或計劃陰謀發動或支持侵略戰爭等罪行，自不能僅因其身份係敵軍總司令官，遽以戰罪相繩。至在被吿任期內，雖駐紮江西蓮化，湖南邵陽，浙江永嘉等縣日軍，尙有零星暴行發生，然此應由行爲人及各該轄區之直接監督長官落合甚九郞，菱田元四郞等負責，該落合甚九郞等業經本庭判處罪刑，奉准執行有案。此項散處各地之偶發事件，旣不能證明被吿有犯意之聯絡，自亦不能使負共犯之責。綜上論述，被吿旣無觸犯戰規，或其他違反國際公法之行爲，依法應予論知無罪，以期平允。」</p>
<p>岡村寗次於聆判退庭後，請求謁見石美瑜庭長以表謝意，石庭長不予接見，但囑翻譯官轉知：「如罪證確鑿，當判處死刑，現旣無罪證，自應依法宣吿無罪，故不必言謝。</p>
<p>石庭長旋吿記者稱：「本案之審判絕無政治作用，本庭純粹根據法律宣判，願負一切責任。至於對或不對，唯待國內及國際人士公評」。</p>
<p>按岡村蜜次於去年八月二十三日經首次公審後，因軍事法庭尙須向漢口方面調查證據，又因岡村患肺疾，故遷延已久。昨上午十時再審，下午四時宣判。除庭長石美瑜外，會審法官有陸起，林健鵬，葉在增，張體坤等四人。再審時檢察官並無新證據提出，岡村亦未再作申辯。辯護律師江一平楊鵬遲到，僅由錢隆生略爲辯護；（一）湖南浙江等地日軍暴行應由直接監督長官負責。（二）岡村於投降後辦理移交有功。至十時三十五分由庭長論吿辯論終結。下午四時宣判後，軍庭並發表印刷品包括判決主文及理由之判決要旨。岡村面色紅潤，己無病容。宣判後仍還押戰犯監獄，本案尙須呈報中樞最高當局核定。</p>
<h3>伊東忠夫長監　櫻庭子郎無罪</h3>
<p>〔太報訊〕軍事法庭昨另宣判罪犯案兩起：（一）前日本陸軍大尉法務官伊東忠夫共同殺害俘虜，處無期徒刑。伊東忠夫爲前日本台灣軍司令部裁判所法務官。民國三十三年冬有我浦東忠義救國軍隊員李世榮等二十四人搭帆船赴寗波受訓，途遇暴風，飄抵合灣大安港，被敵發覺俘獲，解送軍司令部，將其中二十人判處死刑。伊東忠夫爲主審者之一。（二）前日本第二十軍八十二旅旅團長櫻庭子郞，宣吿無罪。櫻庭子郞被控縱容部屬在湖南株州屠殺商民，經調查未獲證據。</p>
<h3>戰犯案件全部審畢　軍庭二月底結束</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕軍事法庭所有戰犯案件，現已全部審畢，該庭決於二月底結束。據發表統計：受理戰犯案共二千二百餘件，判處死刑者一四五件，判處有期或無期徒刑者四百餘件，其餘無罪遣送。判刑罪犯現仍押於江灣戰犯監獄，如局勢惡化，可能解送台灣執行。</p>
<h3>首都公務員多批　抵滬待航輪南下</h3>
<p>南京公務負及其眷屬已有多批乘火車抵滬候輪南下。據招商局息：截至目下止，向該局接洽急需船隻者有行政院，交通部及財政部等各重要部會，其目的地爲福州及廣州，唯均係個別向該局要求撥配船隻，並無統一性負責辦理疏散之機構，致使招商局對船隻之調配應付爲難，該局希望政院派員來滬，協辦統一性之疏運工作。</p>

<h3>美駐滬總領葛柏德表演說　駁斥中共反美論調</h3>
<p>（上接二版）驟明中其次責難美機侵犯中國領空主權一事。美國政府任何一架飛機在中國的飛行沒有不是獲得合法當局的明確同意的。我們的飛機在英國領土上空飛行，和外國飛機在美國領土上空飛行，都是同樣的情形，而從來沒有人感覺，這些飛機是侵犯英國或美國的生權。我們在中國任何地方旣未請求，也未獲得任何特別的航空權利。但我們却願意知道中共對於另一强國對中國所加的協定，如何看法，根據這個協定，甚至中國政府對於美大使館飛機建議飛往迪化一事，也無法予以同意。</p>
<p>所謂賣國條件　何所見而云然</p>
<p>詳單中又講到「國民政府和夫國政府所訂立的許多賣國條約」，並要求予以廢除。我們最近和中國所訂的兩項條約是在一九四三年和一九四六年所訂的。在第一項條約中，我們放棄我們的治外法權和通商口岸的租界權利。</p>
<p>假如中國共產黨認爲這是賣國的條約而設法予以廢棄，那麽我要明白向他們表明我們決計拒絕收回我們的治外法權和港口租借地—表們深喜這種對中國主權的侵犯已經結束了。</p>
<p>我們最近的另一個條約，就是一九四六年簽訂而僅於去年十一月卅日生效的通商條約，業已替代了依然存在的一切不平等條約。這個條約的目的，乃在以一個條約來代替它們。這個條約應該承認中國在與外國簽訂協定之時應該可以要求平等的待遇。這是中國政府所曾談判過的第一個平等商約。我不能說是否這位出衆的領袖認爲這個條約是一個不平等條約——他沒有確切說明那幾個條約是他所反對以及這些條約中的那幾條是他視爲例外的。但是假如這的確是指這個條約的話，那麼他和我的朋友高爾德意見完全一致，認爲這是不公平的。諸君應該記得高氏曾在「大美晚報」的整個背面對這儸條約力予反對。或許我應該要求非美活動調查委會來調查一下這兩位壯士之間奇怪的聯繫。但是，我們在美國可以聽到雙方面的反對意見，因此，我們在大體上可以感覺到我們已經達到了一種相當公平的中間立塲。</p>
<p>剩餘物資協定用以抵付欠賑</p>
<p>在戰後期間，我們且會和中國簽訂若干有關執行事務的協定。其中之一，卽爲一九四六年的剩餘物資協定。根據這個協定，我們同意將價値約在五億美元以上的剩餘物資（應該特別指明一點，乃是：槍砲，彈藥，軍用飛機和其他作戰用品，是明白規定，不包括在內的）。以及其他若干東西移交給中國，至於上述其他若干東西，主要係用以抵付吾國軍事人員在中國時所負欠的帳目的。我們沒有要求中國付出吾國軍事人員在華時的費用，而我們却曾要求我們的其他盟邦付出吾國軍事人員駐在它們領土之上時的費用，作爲吾國租借援助的一部份抵償。中國共產黨是不是爲了這一點而發出怨言？這的確是我們最近和中國所訂任何協定中具有不平等性質的最明顯實例。在剩餘物質協定之下，中國政府同意以中國通貨二〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元另置一旁，俾使其對於中國經濟不致成爲一種負担—藉以成立一個敎育基金。或許這是美國文化侵略的一個驚人例子，因爲這筆金錢是必須完全用在中國的。但是甚至中國共產黨也不能批評吾國敎會方面多年來在中國抱着高貴的意向和關切的愛護之心電敎育而用去的許多金錢。但是在共產黨的觀念中，貿易的思想竟是違禁的東西，這一點是相當可悲的</p>
<p>我並不以爲這個聲明中可能指一九四六年的空運協定爲一個賣國條約，這在文字上是完全互惠的，一方都准許另一方運用三條國際航綫，事實上，這個協定已經大大改善中國的國際交通。</p>
<p>或許共產黨在指我們的援助協定是賣國條約。這裏就是共產黨宣傳眞正盡力非難美帝國主義的地方—它說我國的援助計劃完全是一個陷阱，其目的：（一）在奴役中國的工人，以及（二）在處置我們的剩餘物品，藉使我們資本主義經濟搖搖欲墜的機構可以再維持一些時候，所遺憾者，中國共產黨對於這些思想也沒有加以發揮。大致他們已經發覺在沒有言論自由的地方，他們母需證明他們的論點。無論如何他們沒有說明我們爲什麼不應該幫助中國政府。須知這個政府是爲其他一切政府承認爲中國唯一合法當局的，包括蘇聯在內。</p>
<p>簽訂協定目的造福中國人民</p>
<p>關於我們的援助計劃的事實是非常簡單的。我們已經簽訂協定，希望藉此能保證援助可眞正造福於中國人民，曾經堅持美援應附帶政治條件的少數美國頑固份子，在聽見下列傳聞後，無疑的會愧極而泣，而自認錯怪了國務院，這種傳聞，就是（如果我們相信共黨的宣傳的話）我們已經在大衆的不知不覺中，從國民政府獲得重要的政治上的特權。我對於這種想法，亦須加以料正。我們在作各種援助時，從未想到政治上的問題。援華計劃結束後，中國政府並沒有任何對美國的永久的義務。中美旣有傳統的友誼，我們在援助時，除了希望援助能有效的遝用以外，並不堅持要更多的報酬。我們的援華協定的目的，是在帮助中國的勞工。這些協定以糧食供給工人與他的家庭，以燃料及棉花供給工廠，使能繼續開工，並以衣着供給工人。今天，在上海有價値數百萬元的物資，美國將這些物資贈送中國人民，並未想到要物質的補償。只要這種援助能有利於中國人民，美國人卽認爲滿意。美國人民決不會乘着中國的災難的機會攫取對華的自私利益　也許在這一方面，中國共產黨會答覆一個問題。中共是歡迎美國的援助呢？還是別一國的援助？前者正無代價地將價値千百萬美元的物資運進中國，後者則將東北的一切能够移動的東西都拿去，其數量並不太少。這種援助叫中國損失了二十億的幾器與其他物資。</p>
<p>共黨的宣傳物，對於經合署長霍夫曼有關美援供給共黨區域的談話，肆加嘲笑，我已經看到這些宣傳物，其中對於霍夫受所說的話：如果綴合署官員能監督美援，並能自由發佈有關美援的新聞，則美援可繼續一點，備加指斥。本人最後担任的工作，係在東南歐某共產國家，在那裏，聯總的援助被共黨政權用來酬報忠實於共黨的人和處罰不信共黨的人。政府宣傳同聲讚揚政府取得援助的功績，但同時朝夕痛罵百分之九十援助來源的美英兩國。是否由於這一點，中共就認爲接受霍夫曼的條件乃有損於中國的主權。</p>
<p>我們的援助計劃，並且包括一個農村建設協定。我不知道共產黨是否將認爲這又是另一個帝國主義計劃，以謀阻碍中國農作物的滋長以及將美國農業機械出售給中國農民。但是，我的確知道這不是我們的意思，我們想做的乃是要帮助中國農民儘量利用他極有限的田畝。假使共產黨認爲這個協定是賣國性質的，那麽讓他們盡量加以發揮好了。</p>
<p>大量產物運華　不需物質利益</p>
<p>總之，假如共產黨的宣傳能够說明我們以吾國大量產物給予中國，究竟希望什麼物質利益，這將是很有助益的。沒有一個國家靠這種方法致富的。假使共產一黨的宣傳能够說明我們怎樣可以把食物，燃料，和原料給予中國工人而又能藉此而推進我們的帝國主義企圖，這將是同樣有助益的·須知中國工　是用這些原料來工作，而我們對於所提供的援助，並未附以任何永久性的牽制。再者，我們可以問問用什麼辦法把這些條約廢棄？一九四三年的條約，爲了明顯的理由，並無廢棄的規定包括在內·一九四六年的條約在五年之內不能予以廢棄。我們不能想像中國共產黨願意像希特勒成爲公認破壞條約者。條約僅得根據其本身的規定或對方的同意，始得予以廢棄。</p>
<p>中國土地特權喪於中蘇協定</p>
<p>我們旣然在談不平等條約，那末，假使我們能够聽到中國共產黨對一九四五年的中蘇條約準備作怎樣的處置？這將是很有助益的。的確，這是不平等條約和著例——據我所一知，這是當前中國還參與其間的惟一具有不平等性質的重要條件——因爲這中間把中國土地上的特權擬給予一個外國。當美國人民聽列中國共產黨非難賣國條約的時候，假如他們要求廢棄一九四五年中蘇條約的話，美國人大致會相信他們非難的誠意。奇怪的事實，乃是美國爲了建議這個條約，似乎比把這個十九世紀傳統帝國主義性質的條約硬加予中國的國家，在中國受到更多的批評·至於美國先前所以擬議這個條約，乃是爲了恐怕史惡劣的事情會發生的原故。（下接五版）</p>

<h3>本年國庫收支事項　暫參照舊科目處理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行國庫局頃通函各分行處，以准財政部國庫署函，略以國庫卅七年度業已終了，卅八年度亦經開始，關於三八年度中央政府總預算，尙未編列完成法案，是以本年度國庫會計應用科目，無法編送，爲顧及年度開始後，處理困難起見，所有已發生之卅八年度國庫收支事項，仍請參照國庫出納會計制度，及卅七年下半年度國庫會計應用科目權爲處理。如卅八年度應用科目有所變更時，再行查明，分別冲正。</p>
<h3>今年台糖外銷　將較去年加倍</h3>
<p>據台糖公司悉，該公司在台灣所有各廠卅七年至卅八年期之壓榨工作，已經部份開始。其總生產量，可達預計目標四十萬公噸。爲爭取外匯及供應國內消費起見，預定本年內之運售計劃，爲（一）本省五萬噸，（二）國內二〇萬噸，（三）日本一〇萬噸，（四）南洋五萬噸。又悉該公司卅六年至卅七年度之運銷情形，爲（一）本省爲三萬噸，（二）國內約十二萬噸，（三）日本約四萬五千噸，（四）南洋約二萬五千噸云。</p>
<h3>中行僑匯收入增加</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國銀行國外部經收南洋各地及美洲等地之僑匯數額，最近又見增加。過去每日經收額約折合美金三萬元左右，兩週來僑匯收入轉好，每日可收七八萬美元左右。最近數日則增加至每日十萬元左右。據悉：最近僑匯收入增加，其重要原因爲：（一）中央銀行僑匯掛牌隨時按實際情形調整，故與黑市牌價相距不遠。（二）僑匯經由黑市匯至國內各地，帶有冒險性。如牌價與黑市相隔不遠，僑胞則大都希望經由國家銀行匯至各地。</p>
<h3>呢羢虛盈實虧</h3>
<p>巡　呢羢大批發戶，棋盤街及長樂茶會上呢羢掮客跑街輩，集市奔跑者，减少許多。蓋多返鄕渡歲，又因銷路落令，賣買雙方都謀收束，靜待下月初五六日再做生意。查三十七年度呢羢業各商號，大多數決算後，皆虛盈實虧。按照賬册金圓券折算，俱可盈餘，如照堆金存貨計算，碼份减缺，均欲虧本云。</p>

<p>頃據台灣歸客談，目前台省五大特產，香蕉，柑柚，茶葉，鳳梨，帽蓆，（一）香蕉：主要產地台中，高雄，台南，當局以訂定香蕉復興五年計劃（按一九四〇年輸出最高紀錄三千八百卅一萬五千一百六十三圓十七錢輸往日本美國等地）（二）柑柚：島內各地市塲觸目皆是，以台南州文旦最著，中北部之柑，南部之　，台北州之柑，每年以九月中旬至翌年三四月間，產量最旺，（三）鳳梨，波羅特產最著者加工製造具有四十年之歷史，農林部近有五年計劃鳳梨罐頭，可年達二百萬箱，種類分外國種，本土種，本土種更分紅皮種黃皮，鳥皮等因果實較小，不適於罐裝，外國種質量較新嘉坡，夏威夷無遜色，暢銷歐陸，（四）帽蓆：爲台島副業之大宗，藝術精妙，幾爲台省婦人之專業，此種女工有數十萬人，年內可生產三千餘萬件，（五）茶葉：按一九四三年茶樹栽種面積四萬七百九十三甲，戰後政府積極整頓，以爭取國際市塲，茶產分卅餘種，內紅茶爲全部發酵茶，在世界茶市頗多佳評，烏龍茶半發酵茶，香氣最烈，包種茶次之，目前或銷國內福州，汕頭廈門，天津等處，國外市塲南洋羣島，英國土耳其，俄國等處·</p>

<p>一二〇號天橋七四〇〇〇元登塲後，聞金價平穩，業外各物走勢盤旋，人心無所榮辱，但因歲暮日迫，檯面已不再扳持，執戶咸欲脫手，喊價微小，迨至收市，跌至七〇〇〇〇元了結，又軋小五〇〇〇元，午後行情仍未好轉，金價回堅貨價仍小，走勢續痰，天橋喊六七〇〇〇元，六八〇〇〇元賣出，又較前市縮短。</p>

<p>〔本報台北廿日航訊〕陳誠主席接事到現在，巳逾旬日，他打破了宦海中傳統的積習，人事問題靜如止水，僅加派了秘書，參議，專員三人，這一種同而雖未可必其持久，但聰了他對新聞記者關於人事方面的談話，說完全聽命於人民意志，人民認為需要這個人，必使蟬聯，人民認為不需要這個人，也決不徇情姑息！言中之意，當係在說明今後有所更迭，純粹以能力操守為抉擇，措飼雖似寬容，實則非常嚴正，較之一般官吏，不問賢愚，大事改弦更張的作風，自不可同日而語。合灣的同胞對他這一種賢明的舉措，是傾致着無限欽敬的，尤其是素知他操守淸廉，自奉儉樸，私德上的修養非常人所可及，更是人人崇仰，現於辭色。照陳氏得台胞擁戴的程度看起來，我們可以預測到他在台灣的成就，正朱可限量。</p>
<p>陳氏就職後的一星期中，與各界接觸頻繁，除接踵往訪的賓客和新聞肥者外，更屢次集體招待了黨政軍首長以及省市參議員，國大代表，立監委曁中央委員，在這許多集會中，他一再提出「人民至上，民生第一」的口號，並表示驟膺重寄，對台灣的瞭解不深，若千問題不及研究癓結，對今後興革，尙不能具體報吿。</p>
<p>光復三年以來物價指數狂增</p>
<p>就台灣現狀而觀，在表面上沒有內地戰亂不息的殘破，沒有內地哀鴻遍野的慘酷，物價波動的幅度，也沒有內地那麼劇烈。誰不認為這一個蕞爾海島，是世外桃源，人間福地？然而，台灣的同胞以及久處台灣的人民，他們決沒有這種看法，記者用不着多舉例子，卽以生活一層來講，光復三年餘來，零售物價指數，增加到壹百壹拾萬肆仟柴百壹拾捌倍，而其中因台匯調整，已獲無形抵補的倍數尙不編列在內·簡單一點來說，我們放棄指數的科學統計方法，眼前一般物價，除食米以外，舉凡日用必需品，上漲的幅度雖不大，然而折合金圓，也莫不較京滬昻貴六成至一倍，其中尤以衣着為最。台灣同胞生活日趨艱難，可想而知，假使沒有糧食政策和台幣政策表裏為用，我們相信今日合灣表面上的安定，早已不復存在。但是糧食政策和台幣政策，就能長此維護這種安定嗎？</p>
<p>治標權宜辦法不足以言治本</p>
<p>事實上，治標的權宜辦法，絕不可看做澈底的治本之道。記者試分析其中的理由如下：糧食政策的成效，不外乎兩點：第一是使政府把握着大量實物，其次則卽因了這許多實物而發揮它抑制糧價於某一個程度，不能再高的作用。這一種政策同然是意善法美，毫無瑕疵，任何人都應該承認它對民生上的裨益，然而，我們知道民生問題決不是單純的糧食問題，因此，台灣糧食政策的成功，僅僅在民生問題中獲得了一部份的帮助，並不就是整個的解決。我們回顧事實，今日台灣米價，每台斤雖超過台幣一千元，較上海約便宜三分之一，姑不論台灣與上海有產區和非產區的分別，也不必研究這一個價格的是否合理，我們終算耳目所及，還沒有人為食米而惶惶不安，因為政府的實物正不斷地在辦理着戶口配給，公敎特種配給，非耕農的人民都靠了這種供應不需憂慮。但是耕農的情形如何呢，每台斤超過一千元的米價，已經是前所未有，駭人聽聞的價格了，而以之與其他生活必需品，如布疋等類相較，記者卽使不列舉它的差額，祗要參照了前面所說，莫不比上海昻貴六成至一倍的話，我們可以想見以低於上海的糧食換貴於上海的其他日用品，其懸殊的程度，將如何之鉅了。台灣農戶總數達三十二萬三千一百二十一戶，其中所謂大戶僅三千四百零一戶；大戶的收益，最少者期產一萬一千一百公斤，雖有田賦·公學糧·隨賦收購及四成餘糧收購的負担，但每年兩期收穫，還有九千四百一十八公斤的净餘，生活當然絕無問題，但全省農戶中，大戶不過佔百分之一强，大多數非大戶的耕農，其胼手胝足流血流汗所得，當然更微乎其微，用以應付五花八門的生活支出，其艱難又可想而知。至於公敎人員及廣大的貧民，口糧雖然無處，而薪給微薄，更是捉襟見肘，非惟談不到什麼仰事俯蓄，連瞻義妻兒也多力有不逮者。因此，我們覺得合灣的糧食政策固然應該始終貫澈，但假使要依賴糧食政策侈言民生安定，實是斷章取義之談。</p>
<p>推行輔助政策必需品總配給</p>
<p>進一步來說：政府要想使糧食政策獲得全省同胞的一致擁護，似乎必須推行一種平行的輔助政策，質言之，就是生活必需品的全面總配給。凡水準生活以內的需甩品，都予計口計量普遍平價配售，這是一件偉舉，而在陳誠主席「人民至上，民生第一」的口號下，也是省政當前必要的課題。我們無可諱言，滬件偉舉在實施之前，一定有許多技術上的困難，譬如說戶籍啦，資金啦，虧耗啦，經辦人員啦，都需要費一番籌揹。但是記者認為這些困難應該可以排除，第一，戶籍問題台灣已辦有極好的基礎，祗要稍加整理，自能臻於正確，幷且可以號召人民自動糾正以往的錯誤。第二，資金問題台灣銀行有發行權，因配售而需要的鈔票，幷不能算是膨脹通貨。第三，虧耗問題，合灣有這麽多的公營企業，都是本省同胞被壓榨五十一年的血汗結晶，過去因人事上的浪費，盈利微細，今後應該加强管理，以盈利的一部份來撥補配售虧耗，何况本省農礦產物豐富，大多由政府掌握統籌運銷於國內外，如果經營得法，盈利必多，也可以一部份撥虧耗。第四，經辦人員問題，尤為輕而易舉，本省的物資調節委員會機構龐大，人員衆多，過去數月，僅辦過若千次不定期的定量配售，其他業務頗多為外界詬病，認為與民爭利，雖然不可必其為如此，但這一機構假使眞有存在價値，則使之辦理全面配售，實在最為適宜。</p>
<p>在陳辭修先生施政大計中，也有今後物資要謀合理分配的一句話，所謂全面配給，不過說得比較具體一點而已，也惟有俟這具體的辦法實施後，本省的糧食政策纔能貫澈完成。</p>
<p>台幣政策精華在於機動調整</p>
<p>其次，要分析到台幣政策，台幣政策的精華不外乎在機動調整，它的成效就是减弱了合灣物價波動的幅度，而並不是澈底消弭波動。嚴格點說。儘管合匯調整到如何高度，台灣物價終仍然遠超內地，可見物價問題是整個的供求問題，依賴幣値提高絕不是根本辦法，何况合幣提高，也有它不可避免的損害，卽對出口事業發生了嚴重的影響。過去數月中，不乏實例，當合幣恢復機動調整之初，接連兩次急遽的提高，金圓價値自一八三五元劇降至一千元，再降至六百元，那時候本省出口事業，幾乎面臨破產的危機，這是台匯對本省工商業的威脅。我們再研究合匯對合灣銀行的業務影響如何，記者敢判斷它在純銀行業務的觀點上，也是有害無益。大家必然還記得，當台匯恢復機動調整後不久，合灣銀行卽宣佈了停兌省外匯款的辦法，並將正當商業匯款也限制於最低的數額。這一個辦法雖說是針對着防制省外游資湧集刺激台灣物價而實施，但是根據經濟學理，任何一個地方的建設和開發，祇有歡迎外來游資導使正軌。因此，合灣旣急需建設開發，假使純粹因了防制刺激物價而停兌省外匯款，豈非捨本逐末，因噎廢食之舉？因此，裏面必有不得已的苦衷，所謂不得已的苦衷，簡括言之，不外乎恐怕掌握的金圓頭寸太多，台匯調整一次，就要遭遇一次虧損，台匯不斷調整，這一種虧損也將不斷增加，終有使台灣銀行不勝負荷的一天。同時，商人套匯，也必然愈演愈烈，台幣的膨脹，尤其難以預計。我們根據上述兩點已成的事實，可以明瞭台幣的調整，對本省民生上的帮助雖不能一筆抹煞，要亦並非可資依賴的久安之計</p>
<p>台幣政策成功能首先全面配給</p>
<p>那末如何使台幣政策成為有百利而無一弊呢？姑且先針對前述的兩種現象，記者認為在物價方面，也有靠實施生活物品全面總配給相輔而行的必要。人民生活所需不必仰給商販，商販縱然任意岡牟過份的利潤，也無人受此剝削。至於非生活所需的奢侈品，與廣大人民的生活需要沒有關繫，一部份資產階級負担高物價，乃為了豪華的享受，自屬力所能及，政府可不必顧問。其次，將台匯與物價的關係冲淡之後，卽不需要劇烈調整，在台灣銀行固可以避免虧損，而省外匯兌也可恢復辦理，讓游資到台灣來，政府想一種吸收的辦法，導使進入正當投資的途徑，我們相信台灣的建設和開發，纔有事半功倍的指望。</p>
<p>無論就任何一方而講，在陳誠主席「人民至上，民生第一」的大前提下，實行生活物品全面總配給，其重要性和必要性實在超過一般經濟建設的措施之上。民生不解決，我們要想談經濟建設，無非綠木求魚，雖然卽使實行了生活物品的全面配給，也不見得就能解決整個民生問題，但至少每一個人水準生活的需要可以獲得褲益。同時，政府再號召人民共同為經濟建設努力，動員增產，以提高生活水準，定能使全省響應，樂於效命。</p>

<h3>美駐滬總領葛柏德發表演說　駁斥中共反美論調</h3>
<p>美國軍官在華何嘗協助作戰</p>
<p>〔上接第四版〕我們似乎已離開我們所討論的那篇聲明頗遠了，所以讓我們再講回來罷。次一個說法是說美國軍事顧問團參加中國的內戰。這種說法，根據什麽證據，倒是很有興趣知道的。共黨可曾俘獲在濟南·錦州·瀋陽·徐州或天津協助國民軍作戰的美國軍官嗎？事實是，共黨知道美國軍事顧問團並未參加內戰，他們所奉的命令是絕對禁止參加中國內戰的。美國在中國並不需要權力，也不要沒有權力的責任。顧問團派到中國來，是在調解破裂之前，目的在於執行一種長期的計劃，這個計劃將使另一個侵略者，在重蹈日本覆轍之前，再想一想。它來到中國，獲得共黨的完全同意，它的意向是共黨的軍隊應包括在它的訓練計劃中，（這個意向因內戰重新爆發而受阻）。當然，共黨一定知道：如果國民軍由炎軍顧問團指揮，那末，他們（國民軍）的軍事作戰行動，決不會如此惡劣。</p>
<p>所有美國配備決非用於內戰</p>
<p>我們次一步討論到我們供給興中國國民軍的飛機，坦克車和大砲的事情。這裏的事實是：國民軍所有的美國配備大半是在一九四六年七月以前所供給的。這是美國運來協助中國粉碎日本的侵略和防止侵略的重演，而不是想用在內戰中的。中共不應忘懷：僅在四年之前美國和國民黨及中共都以反抗軸心為共同的目標，正如我們反對共產主義的，切不可忘懷中共在抗日戰爭中的不少英勇事蹟或他們對我們共同目標的服務。</p>
<p>我們旣已在一九四六年七月之前，把美國軍火重新配備大批國民軍，我們當然不能拒絕和我們合作的國民政府向我們購買這些軍器所需要的子彈。當對方的黨派更加奴顏婢膝追隨一個外國的黨陣綫之時，我們當也不願拒絕該政府購買子彈。我們曾於一九〇〇年聲明反對任何外國帝國主義控制中國，以後我們向來遵循這一個同樣的政策。我們相信：這不但為了我們自己的利益，同時也是為了中國的利益，我們繼續這樣的想法。那時候，我們並不是為了屠殺中國人民供給這些武器的，這些武器，是為了保衛他們的自由，抵抗日本或其他要控制中國的外國，保持本身的獨立之用的。我們不希望中國像歐洲許多其他古國一樣，違反人民的意志，沉淪在外國的暴政之下。</p>
<p>本人所引用的聲明的全部均暗示國民黨是美國的扈從，國民黨當局是我們的傀儡與走狗。假若有人這樣想，我勸他一讀史迪威將軍的作品，他說明我們的軍事長官，在中國戰區受人忽視的程度。他也可以看看上海的國民黨的官方宣傳，此種宣傳批評美國遠甚於蘇聯。</p>
<p>中共是否盲目　追隨莫都命令</p>
<p>在這一方面，我有一個問題要問共產黨。</p>
<p>一九四八年六月共產黨情報局發佈了一項公報，譴責狄托與南斯拉夫政府的其他領袖。你會說南斯拉失遠得很，同中國有什麽關係呢？在那項公報內，情報局說明狄托的罪狀在於拒絕盲目的服從莫斯科政治局的命令，在於他堅持自己有解釋馬克斯與列寗的權利，在於他堅特保障南國的利益，在於他與非共黨份子聯合組成全國解放陣綫，治理南國·因此種種，他被稱為托派叛徒。</p>
<p>中共已公開並毫無保留的寶同這個公報。</p>
<p>我的問題是中共是否盲目的追隨莫斯科的命令？如果我們從他們對於這個公報的贊同與其他許多證據來推論，他們是聽命於莫斯科的，則共黨也不能認為我們說錯。美國不相信中國人民願意受外國命令的統治。基於傳統的友誼，美國已從供給援助以防止這種事情的發生。如果我們沒有提供更多的援助，這主要是由於我們懷凝援助是否能有效運用，而不是由於我們缺乏援助的熱誠。我們並不要吿訴中國政府應當怎樣處理它的事務，從而侵害中國的主權。那些指責美帝國主義控制中國的人不妨解釋他們自己是否也接受另一個外國的指示。</p>

<h3>The Prospect of Peace Grows Dim, Government Efforts Remain Unabated, General Zhang Zhizhong Will First Return to Dihua</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The faint hope of peace talks dimmed again on the 26th due to the CCP's broadcast alleging the exposure of "the Nanjing government's sham peace conspiracy." However, the government's efforts towards peace have not slackened. The statement passed by the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 26th, urging the CCP to designate a location and send representatives for negotiations as soon as possible, was still issued as planned in the evening, hoping that the CCP would no longer insist on its own views and prioritize reducing the suffering of the people. However, leading figures here are increasingly concerned about the increasingly harsh attitude of the CCP in its broadcasts over the past two days and its increasingly demanding requests, which have clearly raised concerns about the future of peace talks. Although the broadcast on the 26th was presented in the manner of an observer, it is hard to believe that such expressions were not decided upon and authorized by key CCP figures. Moreover, the accusations against the government agencies and assets moving south, along with speculative interpretations, and the demand to detain so-called important war criminals, are tantamount to adding preconditions before the start of peace talks. It also seems to be a veiled attempt by the CCP to reveal its further intentions. This will make the start of peace talks even more difficult, and the people of the whole country will inevitably feel disappointed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] A government spokesman stated: In order to end the war as soon as possible and alleviate the suffering of the people, the government has taken various measures and steps since January. On the 22nd of this month, it formally appointed peace talk representatives and has been waiting for the CCP to appoint representatives and agree on a location to conduct negotiations. However, according to the CCP spokesman's remarks broadcast by Xinhua News Agency in northern Shaanxi on the 25th, while claiming to be willing to negotiate a peaceful solution with the government, they wantonly insulted and spoke in a harsh manner, and said: "The location of the negotiations will only be determined after the complete liberation of Beiping." May I ask, if the CCP does not immediately appoint representatives and agree on a location, and does not stop military actions, but instead attributes it to the so-called complete liberation of Beiping, is this not delaying time and prolonging the war? It must be known that the people of the whole country are impatiently hoping to eliminate the scourge of war. In order to show the greatest sincerity, the government still hopes that the CCP will recognize that the premise of today's affairs should be to save the people, and promptly appoint representatives to conduct negotiations so that peace can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Government peace talk representatives Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong, as well as Li Acting President's personal representative Gan Jiehou, traveled to Shanghai to solicit opinions from various party figures for the sake of peace. They have now completed their mission and returned to Nanjing by plane and train on the 26th. After Shao and Zhang arrived in Nanjing by plane at 9:30 am, they immediately went to the Presidential Palace to report to Acting President Li on the Shanghai trip and exchange views on the attitude of the CCP's broadcast on the evening of the 25th. The Executive Yuan meeting was then moved to the Presidential Palace, and Shao Lizi and others were invited to attend to report in detail on the negotiations with various parties in Shanghai. The meeting then discussed the matter, and the members spoke successively, also discussing the CCP's broadcast on the 25th. It was then decided to issue a statement in response to the broadcast, explaining the government's attitude, hoping that the CCP could promptly propose the time, location, and representatives for the peace talks, and promote the peace talks as soon as possible. The remaining details were then handed over to the peace talk delegation for discussion at a meeting. In the afternoon at 4 pm, President Sun Ke convened the first delegation meeting at his Executive Yuan No. 1 official residence, inviting peace talk representatives Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhong Tianxin, and other political committee members to discuss the delegation's departure and preparations. It is said that the delegation's departure has been hindered by the CCP's continuous broadcasts in recent days and will obviously not be able to depart in a day or two. However, the cabinet, which is very keen on seeking peace, has not been passive in its preparations.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Political Committee member Zhang Zhizhong, who is currently working for peace in the capital, is scheduled to fly to Dihua for a trip in a day or two due to urgent official business in Xinjiang Province, to handle relevant foreign affairs in Xinjiang Province. He will return to Nanjing in a few days, which will not affect the progress of the peace talks. It is also learned that since the reorganization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, it has made considerable progress in diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in Xinjiang.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi CCP Radio Station Broadcasts Lengthy Message Last Night, A Foreign Observer Believes Peace Talks Have Become Difficult</h3>
<p>[This City News] Yesterday (26th) at 6 pm, the Shaanxi CCP radio station broadcast a lengthy message, the main points of which roughly criticized: "The second 'war criminal' of China, the American puppet Li Zongren, and other people in Nanjing who are pretending to be peacemakers are now verbally declaring their acceptance of the eight conditions proposed by the Chinese Communist Party, but is this declaration genuine? Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong are spreading absurd distortions of the eight conditions. Shao and Zhang's statement regarding the 'punishment of war criminals' assumes that Jiang has retired and that the government is now waiting for the Communist Party to state its intentions regarding the other forty-two war criminals on the list. These peace-like conspirators believe that Jiang's departure from Nanjing is tantamount to 'punishing war criminals,' but in reality, this is nothing more than condoning 'war criminals.' Now, the Nanjing Li Zongren government and its collaborators have one way to prove their sincerity for peace, and that is to immediately detain a large group of key 'war criminals,' including Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Tzu-wen, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Cheng, He Yingqin, Gu Zhutong, Liu Zhi, Tang Enbo, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Jianqun, Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Chiang Ching-kuo, Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, Dai Chuanxian, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Xiufeng, and bring the war criminals abroad to justice. Observers in northern Shaanxi further believe that 'Pseudo Acting President' Li Zongren and 'Pseudo Premier' Sun Ke themselves are key war criminals, and Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi are also lovable figures who support Jiang as 'Pseudo President.' Trying to play tricks is futile. Only if they actually implement the first step of the first of the eight conditions, that is, detain the war criminals and hand them over to the People's Government for trial, will they have the possibility of redeeming their sins." Regarding the above broadcast, the reporter consulted an authoritative foreign observer. According to the answer: If this is the case, the CCP has obviously become more aggressive, attempting to force Acting President Li and Premier Sun to surrender unconditionally. Even Shao Lizi, the "peace elder," and Zhang Zhizhong, the "peace general," who are most enthusiastic about seeking peace, are being insulted, which is truly unimaginable. We outsiders originally thought that the government had indeed made every effort to show its high sincerity in seeking peace. Acting President Li and Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi have successively expressed their willingness to start negotiations based on the CCP's eight conditions and have first dispatched representatives, waiting for the CCP to reply before departing. Unexpectedly, the CCP is making a big fuss about the "war criminals" point and is putting aside Mao Zedong's broadcast that the eight conditions are the basis for peace talks, making Acting President Li feel very difficult. This foreign observer also said that the CCP has not yet formally controlled the government today, but its gaze is already so high. When the coalition government is formed in the future, it will be even more conceivable. Perhaps the CCP today already sees itself as a complete victor and wants to appear before Acting President Li of Nanjing in the posture of "accepting surrender," and after accepting surrender, it will then proceed to try the war criminals, just like the Chinese government's trial of Neiji Okamura today. In fact, the overall situation in China today is no longer a question of whether to make peace or not, but a question of whether Acting President Li's National Government will surrender or not.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiahua Expresses Views on the Domestic Peace Issue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Zhu Jiahua, President of the Academia Sinica, recently expressed his views on the peace issue, saying: Peace is something that everyone desires, but the true meaning of peace lies in mutual respect and mutual tolerance between the two sides, and not in one side surrendering to the other. Only in this way can hatred be eliminated and cyclical retaliation avoided, and then can there be long-term stability. Otherwise, a forced temporary peace will inevitably leave future troubles, and I am afraid that the country, society, and the future of the nation, and even mankind, will be unimaginable. Recently, Mao Zedong's statement and the opinions of Li Jishen and 55 others on the current situation all regard this issue as a domestic matter, which should make everything easier to resolve. Unfortunately, what they say is, in nature, the most harsh conditions in an international war, which is quite puzzling. Because of this, the independence and autonomy of the country and nation, the protection of human rights and democratic way of life, and the freedom of cultural thought and academia are all unknown. From this, we can see the seriousness of the problem and the many difficulties ahead, and it is up to us to make active efforts to ensure that true peace can be realized, so that we can be guiltless to future generations.</p>
<h3>Peng Zhaoxian Talks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] Peng Zhaoxian yesterday commented on the rumors that he had firmly declined to be a peace talk representative, saying: "This is truly a ridiculous matter. Peace is what the people of the whole country urgently demand, and I am also deeply willing to work for it. Although I was not informed in advance about the government's appointment of me as one of the peace talk representatives, I have never made any statements after the announcement. The news of repeated resignations in the newspapers these days is unknown from where it comes. Now that I have seen the New China News Agency's broadcast in the newspaper, I should consider my position as a representative. In order to promote the smooth progress of the peace talks, I have asked representatives Shao and Zhang to request the government to find other suitable candidates. As for the saying that I am representing a certain faction to participate, it is even more absurd, because I have never been interested in factional issues."</p>
<h3>Professors and People from the Peace Strategy Council Plan to Fly to Beiping to Act Accordingly</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] People from the Peace Strategy Council, composed of professors from various universities in Nanjing, plan to fly to Beiping immediately to seek peace and act accordingly. Sun Yufu and others from the council visited government peace talk representative Zhong Tianxin on the 26th to request the government's facilitation of transportation in order to make the trip. It is said that the results of the contact were very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Sichuan, Kang, and Yu Jointly Respond to Changes, Rumors of Personnel Adjustments</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 26th] Wang Lingji visited Liu Wenhui today to discuss specific plans for the joint response to changes in Sichuan, Kang, and Yu, and welcomed Zhang Qun to Chengdu. Otherwise, the two men will go to Chongqing to wait for Zhang to discuss the major plans for Sichuan and Kang. It is widely rumored here that Liu will be transferred to the position of chairman of Sichuan, Wang will be transferred to the position of mayor of Chongqing, Yang Sen will specialize in military affairs, and He Guoguang will serve as chairman of Kang Province.</p>

<h3>Acting President Li Sends Telegrams to Military and Political Leaders, Encouraging Them to Stay in Their Posts and Hoping They Will State Their Opinions for Selection</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Acting President Li sent telegrams to military and political leaders, provincial chairmen, special mayors, pacification directors, and pacification zone commanders on the 26th, saying: "President Chiang Kai-shek, in consideration of the country's difficulties and the people's suffering, resolutely retired to promote the early realization of peace. Zongren, in accordance with Article 49 of the Constitution, assumed the powers of the President and took office on January 22nd. At this time of serious situation, I hope that the military and political leaders of all regions will stay in their posts, work together with one heart and one mind, and work hard together. Your outstanding insights are also hoped to be stated at any time for selection. Li Zongren, January 26th, official seal."</p>
<h3>The National Army Firmly Defends the South Bank of the Chuhe River, Communist Troops Invade Yizheng, Attempt to Test the Waters for Crossing the River and Landing, Unsuccessful, Commander Li Yannian Sits in Puzhen</h3>
<p>[Our Yongzhen Dispatch, 26th] As of 11 pm on the 26th, the National Army in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway is still firmly defending the south bank of the Chuhe River. There are still National Army vanguard troops in the east and west of Geqie on the north bank. Army Corps Commander Li Yannian is still sitting in Puzhen. The rumor that the Communist troops have already entered Puzhen is absolutely incorrect.</p>
<p>[Our Puzhen Dispatch, 26th] Since the National Army completed meticulous deployments on the south bank of the Chuhe River and formed the strongest bridgehead on the north bank of the Yangtze River, thereby protecting the gateway to the capital, the people's hearts in the area of Nanjing's Xiaguan and the two Pus have become more stable. On the 26th, the Communist Jianghuai Independent Brigade in the Wuyi area continued to harass the forward positions of the National Army in Xige, north of the Chuhe River, but they were all repelled by Yang Gancai's entire army.</p>
<p>[Our Puzhen Dispatch, 26th] More than 2,000 Communist troops invaded Yizheng on the afternoon of the 25th. That night, they tried to use small groups of about 50 to 60 people to use civilian ships to attempt a probing landing on the Yangtze River near Gaozi via Lisi Island in the southeast of the city. After being discovered by the National Army on the south bank, they were all driven away. Currently, the key point of Dahekou in the southwest of Yizheng is still being defended by a certain battalion of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Changshu Dispatch, 26th] After the deployment of large armies to defend the river here, the coastal defense is impenetrable. The highway in the Shierxu Port area has been hastily repaired overnight. Ships under 30 tons in ports such as Fushan and Hupu have been successively evacuated to designated locations, while the rest remain moored in their original locations awaiting orders.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] There has been very little military activity along the Yangtze River here today. The ferries between Nanjing and Pukou are busy, and passengers are crowded as usual. A batch of infantry is lined up along the river, waiting to go north. It is said that the Communist troops have surrounded Puzhen, but have not cut off Yangtze River shipping. The Hankou ship that arrived in Nanjing today also had no accidents along the way. Although the situation in the capital is still tense, the order is still good.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] A senior government official told the United Press reporter today that if the peace talks fail, the government will abandon the Yangtze River basin and defend the new defense line in the south to continue the war. If the price of peace demanded by the Communist Party is too high, Nanjing and Shanghai will probably surrender without a fight. The new defense line has been prepared and runs southwest along the Qiantang River from the seaport near Hangzhou to Nanchang, and then northwest from Nanchang to Wuchang. In the past few days, a large number of National Army troops have been ordered to transfer south, and the Ministry of National Defense will also withdraw completely by the 28th, leaving only the garrison command to continue to stay in Nanjing. In order to prevent the failure of the peace talks, the National Army's final new strategy will divide the country into three major groups: the Southeast Group under the command of Li Zongren, the Southwest Group under the management of Bai Chongxi, and the Northwest Group, including the troops of Ma Hongkui and Ma Bufang, all under the command of Hu Zongnan. As for Taiwan, it will be incorporated into the Southeast Group. However, military observers here generally believe that it will be difficult for the government to defend the new defense line for several months with the existing troops, because the government lost most of the well-equipped National Army in the Battle of Xuzhou. At present, apart from a small number of troops from Bai Chongxi and Guangzhou, most of them are new recruits with no combat experience.</p>
<p>Six Bends to Inspect the Front Line</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 26th] The reporter inspected the front line of Liubian with Sun Qifeng, director of the ferry office, on a special boat on the morning of the 26th and saw the garrison troops having lunch with excellent morale. At about 7 am in the morning, a skirmish occurred between the two sides at the forefront of Shijiaqiao, but it stopped after one or two shots were fired. Only three to five Communist plainclothes teams remained stationed there. Currently, the coastal areas along the Yangtze River in Liubian, Guazhou, and Shierxu are under lockdown. The garrison has built many strong bridgeheads and is waiting in full battle array. Due to military transport needs, ferries between Zhenjiang and Xu are still running irregularly. There are often four ferries and six tugboats parked in Liubian, with fires lit and ready to depart for military use. Refugees from Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Taixian, Taixing, Huaiyin, and Huai'an, north of the Yangtze River, are still coming south in succession, looking extremely haggard after a long journey. In addition, the naval gunboats Huian and Lianzhu patrol the river day and night, and at night, they constantly illuminate the north bank of the river with searchlights. At 3 pm, two air force planes flew low along the Yangxu Highway for a long time. It is expected here that the Communist troops have no intention of advancing south for the time being, and people's hearts are calm.</p>
<p>Traffic between Nanjing and Shanghai is Safe</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Since the National Army successively withdrew from Liuhe, Yizheng, Yangzhou, and other places north of the Yangtze River, all sectors of the outside world are quite concerned about the safety of traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway in the future. The reporter specially visited a military observer for this purpose. According to reports, the reason why the National Army continues to withdraw from certain key points along the Yangtze River north of the Yangtze River is, on the one hand, to save troops and strengthen the defense forces on the south bank of the Yangtze River, and on the other hand, to show the government's sincerity and determination for peace talks. As for the abandonment of certain key points along the Yangtze River north of the Yangtze River, especially Yizheng, although the river surface there is narrow, if the Communist troops use heavy artillery to fire at the south of the Yangtze River, it may pose some threats to railway traffic and damage the transportation line. However, the impact is minimal. During the Anti-Japanese War, the area near Tongguan in the western section of the Longhai Railway was always within the effective range of Japanese artillery fire from Fenglingdu on the north bank of the Yellow River. Even with the accurate aiming of Japanese soldiers, we have not heard of any trains being bombed and destroyed.</p>
<h3>Commercial Telegrams between Tong and Ru Interrupted, Rumors that National Army Withdraws from Rugao</h3>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Jingjiang, across the river from Jiangyin, has been surrounded by more than 1,000 Communist troops since the night of the 24th. As of dusk on the 25th, although it is still being defended by the National Army, the situation is obviously extremely serious.</p>
<h3>Wuhu City Defense Headquarters Advises Citizens to Move to Safe Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 26th] The Wuhu City Defense Headquarters, facing the imminent war in Wuhu, advises citizens to move to safe areas to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Martial law continues to be enforced and will only be lifted after the Communist military actions cease.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Prepares to Leave the Mountain, But the Release Order Has Not Yet Arrived in Taiwan, Yang Sen Reports Yang Hucheng's Release to the Pacification Headquarters for Handling</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 26th] The central government's order to release Zhang Xueliang has not yet arrived. Mo Dehui has also not yet arrived here. However, Zhang has learned of this news and is preparing to leave the mountain. It is expected that he will first come to Taipei within this week. In the past two years, Zhang has lived in Inoue Onsen in Hsinchu County. Except that he cannot leave the mountain, everything else is extremely free, and his life is comfortable and his health is very good. [Central News Agency, This City News] Mo Dehui said: He will go to Taiwan in two or three days to visit Mr. Zhang Xueliang and exchange opinions on the current situation.</p>

<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 26th] Yu Youren spoke with Yang Sen on the long-distance phone today, inquiring about Yang Hucheng's situation. According to Air Force Commander Yan Yucong, he told reporters at 5 pm that he had not yet received a telegram from the headquarters assigning a plane to carry Yang Hucheng to Beijing. In addition, Li Huan, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, brought a telegram from Beijing to the Pacification Headquarters today and discussed it with Secretary-General Liao Kaitao for a long time.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Executive Yuan decided today to release political prisoners. The reporter specially asked the Executive Yuan whether those arrested for violating martial law would also be allowed to be released on bail. The person in charge replied: Releasing political prisoners and martial law are two different matters. Violating martial law cannot be called a political prisoner (none of the matters stipulated in martial law are political in nature). In martial law areas, the responsible authorities should still handle matters in accordance with martial law in order to maintain law and order.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said a practical plan had been drawn up to move embassy staff and equipment south as soon as possible. A full withdrawal from Beijing is unlikely in the short term. Other embassies are expected to take similar action. The attitude of the Soviet Embassy is currently unknown. Earlier, French Ambassador Meyrier, leader of the diplomatic corps, had notified the embassies of various countries that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would provide cars to Guangzhou.

<h3>Editorial: Starting with the Development of Backward Areas of the World</h3>
<p>President Truman of the United States is currently drafting a "bold new plan" for the development of backward areas of the world, which will lend 10 billion US dollars to backward countries of the world and complement his own resource development plan. The content of this new plan is currently unknown; however, according to a Washington dispatch from the United Press on the 22nd, US officials stated that this new plan requires the cooperation of four parties: the US government, international banks, US private capital, and recipient countries. Its nature is completely different from the Marshall Plan for foreign aid. The US dollars lent to various countries must be returned in the future. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin was the first to express his enthusiastic support for President Truman's new plan to develop backward areas of the world. He said: "We welcome President Truman's assurance that the United States will use all its resources and technology to defend Western civilization." He also said: "The answer to communism lies in achieving a good standard of living, enjoying happiness, and cooperating with the Western world."</p>
<p>Although President Truman's true intentions for this new plan are not yet fully understood, it can be asserted that President Truman will abandon the "Marshall Plan" and adopt a purely economic new plan. Based on this, the "Cold War" engaged in by the United States and the Soviet Union may be expected to gradually ease in the future; although there is no sign to be believed at present, and the fact is exactly the opposite, the Soviet Union, in order to concentrate the resources and strength of its Eastern European satellite countries, has formulated a Soviet-style "Marshall Plan" for the six countries within the Eastern European Iron Curtain, and will establish an "East European Economic and Mutual Assistance Committee" in order to compete with the European Recovery Program launched by the United States. But in our opinion, it is much better for two different economic systems to engage in economic competition as much as possible than a "Cold War", at least there is no smell of gunpowder.</p>
<p>Recently, there are two major international events that deserve our special attention. One is the signing of the British-Polish trade agreement in Warsaw on the 14th of this month, which stipulates that the total trade between the two countries will reach as much as 260 million pounds, with a period of up to five years; Poland supplies eggs, corned meat, and wood to the United Kingdom, while the United Kingdom imports wool, rubber, petroleum, and industrial equipment to Poland. It is obvious that the relationship between the United Kingdom and Poland will improve as a result. This agreement not only promotes trade between the two countries, but also reverses the economic relations between the two countries. It is heard that the United Kingdom has unfrozen 500 million pounds of the Polish government's deposits in the United Kingdom, and the Polish government has also recognized all its debts to the United Kingdom before the war. This matter is even more sufficient to illustrate the indivisibility of Europe. Despite the fact that Poland is within the red iron curtain, despite the intensification of the "Cold War", it still cannot prevent trade between the United Kingdom and Poland. The second is that South Korea's foreign trade is gradually increasing its exports to the United States, while its business relations with Eastern European countries are gradually becoming estranged. Since South Korean Prime Minister Tito decided to trade with the West in December last year, South Korea has exported non-ferrous metals such as copper, lead, antimony, and mercury to the United States, with a total value of 3,676,000 US dollars, which will inevitably increase in the future. However, the amount of the South Korean-Soviet Union 1949 trade agreement is only one-eighth of last year's total trade; at the same time, South Korea's trade with Poland is also gradually decreasing. Therefore, the Soviet Union has not included South Korea in the East European Economic and Mutual Assistance Committee. This fact is even more sufficient to illustrate that the development of human economic relations is natural and cannot be prevented by any political force.</p>
<p>Fair and mutually beneficial economic assistance will be universally welcomed by countries around the world, regardless of the position taken. Therefore, we can assume that if President Truman's new plan for the development of backward areas is entirely a fair and mutually beneficial economic assistance, without any other effects and intentions, it will surely promote universal prosperity in the world, so that the majority of people can enjoy material happiness, and in the United States itself, there is no danger of an economic panic. Foreign Secretary Bevin said, "A good standard of living is the best answer to communism." Even if the United States still insists on opposing communism and still wants to prevent the outward development of communist forces, this is also the road to peace and prosperity. We hope that President Truman's peaceful efforts can move towards this road of peace and prosperity.</p>
<h3>No Progress in the Situation in the Old Capital, Small Squads of Communist Troops Appear on the Streets for the First Time, Suiyuan Announced Ceasefire Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] (1) Fu Zuoyi has decided to send Guo Zhongzheng, Zhou Beifeng, and Qin Fengchuan to participate in the joint office organization. (2) Liu Zhonghua, representative of Acting President Li, intends to make informal contact with Communist Party personnel through the mediation of Fu Zuoyi and Deng Binshan, and is currently in contact. (3) The two sides have only agreed to a temporary truce on the Suiyuan issue. The Communist Party hopes to follow the Beiping method, while Fu advocates leaving it to be resolved in conjunction with comprehensive peace, so there is no concrete decision yet.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] There is no progress in the situation in Beiping. There are still trivial matters when the National Army leaves the city, which need to be further resolved. The Communist Army has not yet entered the city today, and the joint organization has not been established. However, the National Army representatives of the organization have been determined to be Guo Zongfen, Zhou Beifeng, and Qin Fengchuan.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] The war in Suiyuan has come to an end. Both sides announced a ceasefire starting on the 26th, and other military and political handover issues are being negotiated.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the United Press in Beiping, 26th] Small squads of Communist troops appeared publicly on the main streets of the city for the first time today. People and government soldiers along the way paid close attention to them. They traveled to stores to shop and paid with people's currency.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the United Press in Beiping, 26th] It is predicted here on the 26th that there will be a large-scale military deployment, which is obviously a signal for the step of completely occupying Beiping. Three hundred fully armed soldiers, led by the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, passed by the reporter's residence along the main street in the city. None of the 300 people had the Blue Sky and White Sun emblem on their hats. According to this, this is the only distinction between the National and Communist armies. The reporter greeted the soldiers and asked where they were going. They only smiled and did not answer. The audience and the reporter on both sides thought they were Communist troops, but a senior official denied on the phone that the Communist troops had entered the city. Chinese newspapers said that Ye Jianying will serve as the mayor and chairman of the Beiping Military Commission, Lin Biao has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Pingjin District, and Nie Rongzhen is the garrison commander of Pingjin. Ye Jianying will be the protagonist of the Beiping Joint Municipal Government.</p>
<p>The delay in the establishment of the joint regime is said to be due to the National Army's failure to withdraw from the city at the specified time. In fact, all heavy weapons, ammunition, and other supplies are said to have been concentrated for transfer, and the soldiers seen in the streets only carry light weapons. Preparations for ending the strongholds of the National Army in North China are in full swing. It is said that Yan Xishan has invited a representative stationed in Beiping to invite a third party to be Lu Zhonglian. In fact, it has been constantly heard for months that Yan has contacted the CCP to negotiate peace. Fu Zuoyi's representative flying from Beiping to Suiyuan is said to have completed the peaceful measures for Guisui, Baotou, Datong, and other isolated strongholds. The current president of the Shanxi Law Academy in Beiping sent a telegram to Yan on the 25th, denouncing him for being reactionary and acting like a tyrant. The content of the telegram was published by all newspapers in Beiping. Beiping newspapers are becoming increasingly left-leaning in order to win the favor of the CCP, so they published the full text of the CCP radio station's attack on the Nanjing political situation in large print. Ji Chairman Chu Xichun confirmed that Li Jishen can come to Beiping in one or two days. There is also news coverage of the new political consultative conference in Shijiazhuang.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Local Maintenance Association Established on the 31st</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou, 26th] Local people in Hangzhou, initiated by the Municipal Council, have contacted all walks of life and are actively preparing to form the Hangzhou Local Maintenance Association, which will be formally established on the 31st.</p>
<h3>After the Beiping Armistice, Gold, Banknotes, and Silver Dollars are Actively Traded, Prices Rise and Fall Rapidly</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the United Press in Beiping, 26th] Although the Communist currency has been circulating freely outside the city of Beiping, it has not yet appeared in the city. Since the armistice on the 22nd of this month, US dollars, gold bars, and silver dollars have been actively traded in the city, and prices have fluctuated greatly. The trading of gold bars and silver dollars is more active than that of US dollars. The price fluctuations of US dollars, silver dollars, and gold in recent days are listed below (unit: Gold Yuan Certificates):</p>
<p>US Dollars (per dollar)</p>
<p>Highest Price Lowest Price</p>
<p>22nd 350 250</p>
<p>23rd 240 170</p>
<p>24th 250 200</p>
<p>25th 315 270</p>
<p>Silver Dollars (per dollar)</p>
<p>Highest Price Lowest Price</p>
<p>22nd 400 350</p>
<p>23rd 300 200</p>
<p>24th 400 260</p>
<p>25th 360 340</p>
<p>Gold (per tael)</p>
<p>Highest Price Lowest Price</p>
<p>22nd 25500 22500</p>
<p>23rd 14500 12000</p>
<p>24th 17500 14500</p>
<p>25th 24500 21000</p>
<p>The exchange rate between gold and US dollars was 65 US dollars per tael on the 22nd and 23rd, a maximum of 72 yuan and a minimum of 70 yuan on the 24th, and a maximum of 75 yuan and a minimum of 68 yuan on the 25th.</p>
<p>The price of Gold Yuan Certificates against gold and silver rises and falls rapidly due to rumors and speculation about the future exchange rate of Communist currency against Gold Yuan Certificates. There are many types of Communist currency, with different values. According to travelers to Beiping, the Communist Party stipulates that 8 Gold Yuan Certificates can be exchanged for 1 People's Banknote, and 80 People's Banknotes can be exchanged for 1 silver dollar. If so, then 1 silver dollar is worth 640 Gold Yuan Certificates. This exchange rate is probably also temporary.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] Prices in Beiping have risen sharply in recent days. Today, a bag of flour costs 1600 yuan, a catty of pork costs 380 yuan, gold costs 24500 yuan, and silver dollars cost 520 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wuxi and Chengdu Commodity Prices Weak, Lanzhou Floating Funds Flood the Market</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Wuxi, 26th] The situation is turbulent, actual sales are weak, and commodity prices have fallen again. White rice costs 1302 yuan, wheat costs 1360 yuan, flour costs 570 yuan, soybean oil costs 5700 yuan, and cotton yarn costs 4550 yuan.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chengdu, 26th] The money market in Sichuan was tight during the Lunar New Year. With the opening of peace talks, commodity prices generally fell.

<h3>US Aid Materials Stored in Pingjin, Economic Cooperation Administration Still Plans to Allot and Sell, A Batch of Medicines Arrives in Beiping from Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the United Press in Washington, 25th] Economic Cooperation Administration China Commander Cleveland announced today that the General Administration is settling the amount of US aid materials existing in Beiping and Tianjin, and will compare the cargo accounts with the latest report from the China Branch. The recent report from the China Branch stated that there are US aid wheat, flour, and gauze worth about 4 million yuan in Pingjin, which seems too high. The General Administration still intends to continue rationing to the Chinese people, at least until the materials in China are used up. However, future measures involve political aspects, and the State Department will decide. Continuing rationing is in accordance with established policy. The use of US aid materials in the CCP-controlled area will be subject to the strictest restrictions, and it must be stated that such materials come from the United States, and the branch must send personnel to inspect their use. Since the Communist Army occupied Beiping, the General Administration has not received a report from the resident representative Davis in Ping, probably due to the chaos when the area fell. The representative in Tianjin, Avery, reports by telegram almost every day.</p>

<h3>US Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, Delivers Speech; Refutes Communist Anti-American Arguments</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Shanghai, 26th] The US Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, delivered a speech at the American University Club, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have often published statements by a certain Chinese political leader. Have you all read the one he made on January 14th? Now, let me share some excerpts with you:</p>
<p>"Since July 1946, the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government, with the help of American imperialists, has violated the will of the people, torn up the truce agreement, and launched a nationwide counter-revolutionary civil war, now for two and a half years. In these two and a half years of war, the Nanjing Kuomintang government has violated the will of the people, sold out national interests to the United States, colluded with the American navy and air force to occupy China's territorial waters and airspace, signed a large number of traitorous treaties, and enticed the American military advisory group to participate in the civil war, obtaining aircraft, artillery, rifles, ammunition, and all kinds of military supplies from the United States to massacre the people."</p>
<p>At this point, that political leader stopped attacking American imperialism, perhaps because he was out of breath, although he later specifically pointed out that the abolition of traitorous treaties was one of the conditions for peace talks.</p>
<p>In view of all that the US government has done in China in the past two and a half years, this statement is indeed a very severe accusation, and it is only part of what Radio Yan'an has been saying. Patriotic Chinese individuals and well-meaning American citizens here should certainly want to know whether the US government has actually committed such heinous acts. This is a university gathering, and precisely because academic freedom is a belief that universities should uphold, you all should want to know the truth. Now, let us look at the historical record:</p>
<p>Where is the People's Will? How do We Know It?</p>
<p>The distinguished leader I am referring to seems to be short on facts and long on reckless criticism. As for the former, we may be able to add a little something.</p>
<p>In the short excerpt I quoted, the statement mentions the "will of the people" twice, which must be referring to the will of the Chinese people, but I highly doubt how they know what they mean. In the United States, we can easily know what the will of the people is - and I am not referring to opinion polls. For example, we know that the American people wanted to elect Truman as president.</p>
<p>We know that it was Truman, not Wallace, who received the support of labor. It is generally believed that Wall Street bankers were opposed to Truman's election, and these bankers are the ones Radio Yan'an likes to denounce the most. Therefore, we can be quite certain that when Mr. Truman's government sponsored aid to the Chinese Nationalist government, this was the will of the American people, not what Wall Street bankers wanted. But as for the distinguished political leader I quoted, does he have the same means to ascertain the will of the Chinese people? Have the Communists held free elections in their controlled areas? Has any Communist regime ever held free elections? Or ruled in any country through free elections? The Czechs, Hungarians, and a dozen other nations may be willing to testify to this. Before they accuse the United States of violating the will of the Chinese people, let the Communists obtain a mandate from the Chinese people through free elections.</p>
<p>American Carefully Respects Chinese Nationalism</p>
<p>The statement also mentions that China's national sovereignty has been completely sold out to the US government. In the absence of more specific charges, this charge is a bit like the old joke, "Have you stopped beating your wife?" (Translator's note: There is a popular joke in the United States: A lawyer asks the defendant, "Have you stopped beating your wife?" This question is very cleverly phrased, because whether the defendant's answer is "I have stopped" or "I have not stopped," he has already admitted to having beaten his wife. In short, Cabot believes that the Communist accusations are too empty and impossible to answer.) But perhaps this is just an introduction to various crimes later. Nevertheless, let me say that the United States carefully respects China's sovereignty. The United States does not want to ask the Chinese government or any other government to sell out national rights. We do not want to obtain any privileged position in China for Chinese people or any other people.</p>
<p>The next item is a bit more specific: saying that the Nationalist government "borrowed billions of US dollars in foreign debt from the US government." But strangely enough, the United States has not lent a single dollar to the Chinese government since July 1946; on the contrary, we have refused to continue the proposed $500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank. Even Communist propaganda says that our aid to China since the Victory over Japan has only been $400 million, which itself is a very inflated figure, and most of it does not need to be repaid. I will talk about our aid agreement shortly.</p>
<p>Who is Infringing on Sovereignty? Look at Dalian and Lushun</p>
<p>The next item in the list is: "It has prompted the US government's navy and air force to occupy Chinese territory and territorial waters and infringe on China's airspace sovereignty." Have the Communists forgotten that these troops came to China to help China liberate its territory from the Japanese army? Do they (the Communists) think that these troops will remain in China longer than the recognized Chinese authorities want them to stay? Moreover, we would like to hear what position the Communists take on the fact that a foreign country occupies Dalian? Also, do they also acknowledge the current status of Lushun? Although we agree with the Communist Party's claim about the evils of imperialism, we feel that they should pay attention to the situations mentioned above. In fact, foreign troops in that area seem to be stationed on Chinese soil forever. (Continued on page 4)</p>

<h3>US Armed Services Committee Holds Secret Meeting; To Formulate New US Military Policy; Relations with the Soviet Union Will Be a Major Issue; Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes Appointment of Webb as Undersecretary of State</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] Secretary of Defense Forrestal will present a secret review of the world military situation to the House Armed Services Committee on the 6th, and analyze the administration's defense requests for the 1950 fiscal year. Armed Services Committee Chairman Vinson said that the meeting would be kept highly confidential, but would address the "general state of national defense." Vinson also warned his colleagues in advance that Forrestal and the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force's reports "will be kept under the highest security and must not be leaked." However, US-Soviet relations will undoubtedly be its theme.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 25th] The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee today unanimously passed Truman's appointment of former Budget Director Webb to succeed Lovett as Undersecretary of State. It is expected that the Senate will also pass this motion before the 27th. At the same time, the House Foreign Affairs Committee has not yet been formed due to waiting for the appointment of Republican members. At the same time, the House Armed Services Committee has decided to formulate US military policy with strong measures, so it will hold a secret meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] The US Munitions Board revealed on the 25th that the US stockpile of strategic military materials has increased sharply in recent months and is now almost ready. Board Director Cabant said that the stockpiled materials are currently valued at $1.446 billion. Some of them are post-war surplus stockpiles, and some are newly purchased after the war. The plan began in July 1946 to stockpile materials worth $3.693 billion. According to the current progress rate, this can be achieved around New Year's Day in 1953.</p>
<h3>US Policy Toward China Remains Unchanged; Will Maintain Bipartisan US Foreign Policy; Acheson Announces at First Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Washington, 26th Radio: US Secretary of State Acheson held his first reception for journalists. It is said that if the United States wants to maintain peace, it is best to clearly state in advance that anyone who threatens the security of our country with armed force will encounter overwhelming resistance. He supports the plan for the United States, Canada, and five Western European countries to sign the North Atlantic Collective Defense Treaty.</p>
<p>Acheson first assured that he would strive to maintain the bipartisan foreign policy of the United States and that all plans would be discussed and carried out with Republican leaders. Secondly, he said that the US policy toward China and Latin America will continue unchanged, and he particularly emphasized that there is no change in the current policy toward China. As for the US attitude toward the Communist regime there, he was unwilling to speculate. Third, Acheson strongly stated that the US policy toward Germany will not sacrifice other Western European countries. Fourth, he said that the Soviet Union's recent announcement of a plan to implement economic cooperation with six Eastern European satellite states is a natural response to the US aid plan to Europe and is not surprising. When a reporter asked what policy the United States would adopt toward China, Acheson replied: Truman, Marshall, and Lovett have repeatedly stated in recent weeks that the US policy toward China remains unchanged, and I can only reiterate this meaning at this moment. When a reporter asked other questions, Acheson said: If a Communist government is established in Nanjing, whether the United States will recognize it is something I cannot speculate on at this time. He also refused to answer whether the US embassy would continue to stay in Nanjing or move south to Guangzhou. Regarding the President's "bold new plan," Acheson said that the purpose of the plan is not to equip the entire world with modern facilities, but the US government is determined to do its best to assist culturally backward areas. As for specific plans for implementation, it is still too early at this time.</p>

<h3>The Philippines Plans to Convene a Southeast Asian Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Manila, 25th] Official sources recently stated that the Philippines may convene a regional conference here after the New Delhi Conference to discuss common interests. It is reported that this conference will be strictly limited to Southeast Asian countries because the fifteen-nation organization of the New Delhi Conference is too large and has conflicting interests.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Manila, 25th United Press] A spokesman for the Philippine Foreign Ministry said that the Philippine Envoy to China, Xie Boxiang, will return to his post in Nanjing at the end of January. Xie will first go to Shanghai and then to Nanjing. Xie visited President Quirino with the Philippine Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Neri, before leaving yesterday.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Tel Aviv, 26th] Although the Israeli representatives Hiron and Shatiel at the Rhodes Island truce talks sent a detailed report to Prime Minister Gurion and Foreign Minister Shertok today, saying that the talks have reached a stalemate, it is expected that the two representatives will return to Rhodes Island with new instructions at the end of the week.</p>

<h3>US Western States Hit by Cold Wave</h3>
<p>Snow Seals Pastures, Livestock Starve and Freeze</p>
<p>[United Press Chicago, 25th] The western United States has been hit by a cold wave for several days. Roads are covered with ice and snow. Pastures from western California to Dakota are sealed by snow. More than 100 million head of livestock and millions of sheep are starving and freezing. The US Air Force is dispatching large numbers of aircraft to airlift fodder and drop it for aid. The Air Force today also joined the Army in using road-opening vehicles, trucks, and infantry battalions to open snow-covered roads, on a scale rarely seen in history. In Washington, the Senate Relief Subcommittee has allocated $750,000 to promote rescue work, and the South Dakota State Assembly has also allocated $100,000 for relief expenses. The cold wave has not subsided today. In some parts of Wyoming and Montana, the temperature has dropped to more than forty degrees below zero Fahrenheit.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Have Formed a United Front to Prevent Soviet Expansion in the Middle East; Bevin Publicly Acknowledges in the British House of Commons</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 26th Radio: During a debate on foreign policy in the British House of Commons today, Foreign Secretary Bevin hinted that Britain and the United States have formed a united front to deal with the expansion of Soviet power in the Middle East. Bevin said that Britain and the United States have been able to cooperate frankly on security and economic policies in the Middle East. It is reported that Britain and the United States have recently been striving for consistency in their Middle East policies. This is the first time that British officials have stated that this effort has been successful. Bevin also expressed his willingness to accept President Truman's proposal to assist in the development of backward countries.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 26th Radio: Bevin announced that Britain has agreed to recognize the State of Israel de facto but will not be able to formally announce until after consulting with the Commonwealth. Bevin also said that the United States wants to recognize Transjordan. Bevin stressed that British recognition of Israel must come at the cost of Arab-Jewish peace.</p>
<h3>Egypt, India, and the Philippines Criticize the Four-Nation Proposal; Too Lenient Toward the Netherlands; Demand that the Security Council Take More Severe Action</h3>
<p>[United Press Success Lake, 25th] The United Nations Security Council postponed action again on handling the Dutch-Indonesian dispute on the 25th, as countries from the Asian Conference launched a proposal to strengthen the US and other resolution proposals. Egypt, India, and the Philippines criticized the four-nation proposal for being too lenient toward the Netherlands and demanded that the Security Council take more severe action in accordance with the guidelines of the 19-nation Asian Conference resolution.</p>
<p>United Nations observers expect that the resolute action of the countries of the Asian Conference will strengthen the proposals of the four countries, China, the United States, Norway, and Cuba. Egyptian representative Fauzi Bey accused the Security Council of being "too lenient" toward the Netherlands. It is rumored that Egypt may propose a stronger amendment when the Security Council reconvenes to debate the Indonesian issue on the 27th. But no matter how Egypt criticizes the current draft, no matter what fate any amendment encounters, it is generally believed that Egypt may eventually support the four-nation proposal to ensure the necessary majority of seven votes for passage. Ukraine's Tarasenko severely criticized the entire proposal and denounced it as a "surrender proposal." The US delegation still firmly believes that the case can be passed when it is finally put to a vote - or on the 27th. Ukraine is expected to vote against it, and France, the Soviet Union, and Argentina are expected to abstain. The proposal can be passed with just seven votes.</p>
<h3>Fifteen Hundred Jewish Refugees from Cyprus Arrive in Haifa</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Haifa, 26th] The first batch of 1,500 Jewish refugees from Cyprus arrived here today aboard the transport ship Fatrah.

Israeli military police lined up at the pier and played military music, and thousands of people standing on the pier sang the national anthem together to express their joy. The Israeli authorities have now made preparations to transport all 11,000 Jewish refugees still remaining on Cyprus back within two weeks.</p>
<h3>The Recent Three Major Events in China, Japan, and India Will Affect Western Policy and Cause the World to Face Two Major Forces</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 25th] The three major events that have occurred in Asia, namely, the termination of peace negotiations in China, the general election in Japan, and the Asian Conference in New Delhi, have focused the world's attention on East Asia and are sufficient to clarify the position that the people of the Western Hemisphere should take, so that they can choose between the two major forces of nationalism and communism that they face. In China, after the military failure of the Kuomintang, the situation has become increasingly uncontrollable. Its peace demands have in fact been rejected by the victorious Communist Party. The Communist Party is clearly only willing to negotiate with opponents of the Kuomintang's period of political monopoly or those who had separated before the failure of the National Government. The ongoing union between the Communist Party and the "Democratic League" is increasingly obvious and will establish a regime in China similar to the "people's democracy" governments in Eastern Europe. This kind of political machine is controlled by the Communist Party in both concept and fact. This prospect will constitute a long-term problem and equally complex practical problem in the future relationship between China and Western countries. The so-called long-term problem is whether the People's Democratic Government of China will be as absolutely loyal to Moscow behind the scenes as Outer Mongolia or Romania, or tend towards nationalism like Yugoslavia. The current problem involves the consequences that this new Chinese revolution will have in international conferences. China ranks fifth among the "strong countries" in these conferences, especially in the Security Council and the Allied Control Council in Tokyo. Qualified observers here believe that this issue is particularly acute in the Allied Control Council, where a Communist-controlled China, if it constantly takes actions supporting the Soviet viewpoint, could greatly undermine General MacArthur's plans. The results of the Japanese election have two factors that may further increase the rift between the two countries that defeated Japan, namely the United States and the Soviet Union. One is the disastrous defeat of the centrist parties and the victory of the extreme right-wing conservative parties. The extreme right-wing parties undoubtedly believe that the United States is the best guarantee against Soviet power. The second is the success of the Communist Party. The victory of the Communist Party in China has contributed to this outcome. The new government formed as a result of this election will further make Japan a fortress in the Far East resisting the Communist Party and Soviet forces because the United States will apparently leave China and Korea to their fate. Another resistance center with a different foundation (representing the nationalistic "third force," in which no Communist Party participates) seems to be forming, centered on India. Since gaining independence, India has clearly been eager to take a moderate position and become the center of a group of Asian powers. The New Delhi Conference initiated by India, which is known for taking a moderate position, aims to provide moral support to the non-Communist nationalism of Indonesia. The Viet Minh of the Communist Party of Vietnam and the Soviet republics of Central Asia were not invited. The participating countries emphasized that their resolutions should comply with the principles of the United Nations Charter and avoid making their discussions have the image of "opposition to Western countries' conspiracies." Therefore, the division between Asian nationalism and communism is becoming increasingly clear. Communism has attempted to use this nationalism to benefit itself. Well-informed sources here believe that the recognition of the above facts can increasingly affect the policies adopted by Western countries in Asia.</p>
<h3>Royall to Depart for Japan Tomorrow; Visits President Truman Before Leaving; Will Meet with MacArthur First After Arriving in Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] Secretary of the Army Royall accompanied Chief of Staff General Bradley to visit President Truman on the 25th to discuss matters. Afterwards, Royall told reporters that he and the President discussed his inspection trip to Japan. He said that this trip to Japan will be short-term, similar to the recent trip to Germany. He said that he will discuss military government and economic matters with General MacArthur.</p>
<p>When asked what he thought of the Japanese general election, he replied that he knew MacArthur was very satisfied. Overall, he believed that the results of the general election were very favorable because the government would have the support of a majority party. Royall said that he will depart on the 28th, passing through Alaska, and from Alaska to Tokyo, Okinawa, Guam, and Hawaii, and return to Washington on February 15th. He said that the meeting with MacArthur will discuss "all matters of mutual interest." He declined to reveal more. When Secretary Royall walked out of the White House, he only made a brief comment. When asked whether there would be any new instructions for reporters stationed in Tokyo, he said he had no knowledge of it.</p>
<h3>Travelers to Japan Must Surrender Foreign Currency</h3>
<p>Those Leaving Japan Are Not Allowed to Take Japanese Yen Out of the Country</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur today ordered the Japanese government to amend the regulations on travelers carrying foreign currency in and out of Japan. The new order stipulates that travelers to Japan should surrender foreign currency. Those holding US dollars should exchange them for Japanese yen at a rate of one to 270, or deposit the foreign currency directly into a foreign bank. If foreign currency and US dollars are not exchanged or deposited, they will be kept in custody by the Bank of Japan and returned to travelers when they leave the country. Checks and remittances are not subject to this restriction unless they are brought in by Japanese citizens. Travelers leaving the country may bring all the foreign currency they brought when they arrived and US dollars approved by MacArthur's headquarters, but they may not take Japanese yen out of the country.</p>
<h3>Emperor of Japan's Silver Wedding Anniversary: No Extravagance in the Palace</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 26th] Today marks the silver wedding anniversary of Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako. There is no extravagance in the Imperial Palace, and gifts are refused. Twenty-five years ago, Hirohito's marriage to Nagako was opposed by some ministers. One minister falsely claimed that Nagako was colorblind, which could affect their children, to thwart the aim of combating communism.</p>
<h3>Yoshida Plans to Form a Joint Cabinet of Conservative Factions</h3>
<p>To thwart the aim of combating communism</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 26th] Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida issued his second denunciation of the Communist Party this afternoon after the general election, expressing his desire to "crush the Communist Party." Yoshida made a lengthy statement at a press conference, openly inviting the Democratic Party to cooperate with him. He stated that although the Democratic Liberal Party held a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, he still hoped to form a coalition government of conservative parties. Yoshida visited Democratic Party President Takeru Inukai this morning. He stated that he would meet with Inukai once in early next month to continue discussing the formation of a coalition government. Only after efforts to form a coalition government fail will he form a single-party cabinet. He expressed that under a coalition government system, there is hope to thoroughly crush the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Fire at Nara Temple in Japan: Famous Murals Destroyed Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 26th] A fire broke out this morning at a Nara temple in Japan, a national treasure with a history of 1,300 years. The roof of the main hall was pierced, and twelve famous Buddhist murals painted on the walls were destroyed. The temple was built in 587 AD and has been renovated over the centuries. It is the oldest existing wooden building in the world.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Results of Israeli General Election Revealed: Ben-Gurion Already Leading; Communist Party Unlikely to Exceed Five Seats in Parliament</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tel Aviv, 26th] After the general election in Israel, although the votes cast by the army must be counted clearly by the 28th before the final results can be announced, the voting results this morning show that Mapai, led by Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, has achieved a great victory. It can be determined that Ben-Gurion has an advantage throughout Israel, and the opposition parties are unlikely to obtain many votes. Particularly disappointed are the Israeli communists, who fear that they will not be able to win more than four or five seats in the 120-member Israeli parliament. The right-wing Irgun party is also unlikely to achieve its predetermined goal. Yellin, an important candidate of the Stern Gang who is currently imprisoned awaiting judgment, is likely to be the only representative of the group to enter parliament.</p>
<h3>US Designates February 1st as National Freedom Day</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington, 25th] President Truman issued a proclamation today designating February 1st as National Freedom Day. The proclamation mentioned the goals of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly last December. The day commemorates President Lincoln's signing in 1865 of a joint congressional proposal: recommending an amendment to the Constitution to place the then-permitted system of slavery in the United States outside the protection of the law. The passage of this amendment was the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>

<h3>Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, Yasuji Okamura, Declared Not Guilty; After Leaving the Court, Request to Meet with the Presiding Judge to Express Gratitude Was Rejected; Returned to Prison to Await Central Approval</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The case of General Yasuji Okamura, former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, who was accused of being a war criminal, was retried by the Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense yesterday and declared not guilty. The main text of the judgment states: "Yasuji Okamura is not guilty." The reason given is: "According to the establishment of a war criminal, it is necessary to commit atrocities such as wanton slaughter, rape, and robbery during combat, or to violate international conventions by planning, conspiring, initiating, or supporting aggressive wars. It should not be assumed that anyone who participates in combat should be regarded as a war criminal. This is evident from the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of international law and our country's War Criminal Trial Regulations. In this case, the defendant was ordered by the Japanese military leaders to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Force on November 26, 1944. The atrocities committed by the Japanese army in the major battles of Changsha and Xuzhou, as well as the Nanjing Massacre by Takashi Sakai in Hong Kong and Guangdong, and Iwane Matsui and Hisao Tani in Nanjing, all occurred before the defendant's term of office and were not related to the defendant. (Takashi Sakai and Hisao Tani have been sentenced to death by this court and executed.) Moreover, at that time, the Allied forces had already landed in Normandy, Europe, and Saipan Island in the Pacific. The Axis powers had collapsed, and the Japanese army was isolated. Therefore, from the date the defendant took office until Japan's surrender, a period of eight months, most of the Japanese troops stationed in various parts of our country were demoralized and made little progress. When the Japanese government officially announced its surrender, the defendant ceased fighting, obeyed, and led a million troops to surrender. Based on his actions, he did not commit any of the above-mentioned crimes of slaughter, rape, robbery, or planning, conspiring, initiating, or supporting aggressive wars. Therefore, he cannot be judged as a war criminal merely because of his status as the commander-in-chief of the enemy army. Although sporadic atrocities occurred in the counties where the Japanese army was stationed during the defendant's term of office, such as Lanhua in Jiangxi, Shaoyang in Hunan, and Yongjia in Zhejiang, this responsibility should be borne by the perpetrators and the direct supervisors of each jurisdiction, such as Shinkuro Ochiai and Genjiro Hishida. Shinkuro Ochiai and others have been sentenced by this court and approved for execution. These occasional incidents scattered in various places cannot prove that the defendant had any connection with the intention to commit crimes, nor can they make him liable for the responsibility of a co-offender. In summary, the defendant did not violate war regulations or other acts that violate international law. According to the law, he should be declared not guilty in order to be fair."</p>
<p>After Yasuji Okamura left the court after hearing the verdict, he requested to meet with Presiding Judge Meiyu Shi to express his gratitude. Presiding Judge Shi did not grant the meeting but instructed the translator to convey: "If the evidence of the crime is conclusive, the death penalty should be imposed. Now that there is no evidence of the crime, a verdict of not guilty should be declared according to the law. Therefore, there is no need to express thanks."</p>
<p>Presiding Judge Shi then told reporters: "The trial of this case has absolutely no political implications. This court is purely based on the law to pronounce the verdict and is willing to bear all responsibilities. As for whether it is right or wrong, it is up to the public opinion of domestic and international人士 to judge."</p>
<p>According to reports, Yasuji Okamura underwent the first public trial on August 23 of last year. The Military Tribunal still needed to investigate evidence in Hankou, and Okamura suffered from lung disease, so the matter was delayed for a long time. The retrial was held at 10:00 AM yesterday, and the verdict was announced at 4:00 PM. In addition to Presiding Judge Meiyu Shi, the judges included Qi Lu, Jianpeng Lin, Zai Zeng Ye, and Tikun Zhang. The prosecutor did not present any new evidence during the retrial, and Okamura did not make any further defenses. Defense lawyers Yiping Jiang and Peng Yang were late, and Longsheng Qian briefly defended, arguing that (1) the Japanese army's atrocities in Hunan, Zhejiang, and other places should be the responsibility of the direct supervisors; and (2) Okamura was meritorious in handling the handover after the surrender. At 10:35 AM, the presiding judge concluded the arguments. After the verdict was announced at 4:00 PM, the military tribunal also issued printed materials including the main text of the judgment and the essentials of the judgment with reasons. Okamura's complexion was rosy, and he no longer appeared ill. After the verdict was announced, he was still detained in the war criminal prison. The case still needs to be submitted to the highest authorities in the central government for approval.</p>
<h3>Tadao Ito Given Life Sentence; Shiro Sakuraba Acquitted</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Military Tribunal yesterday separately announced two cases of criminals: (1) Tadao Ito, former Japanese Army Captain and Legal Officer, was sentenced to life imprisonment for jointly killing prisoners. Tadao Ito was a legal officer at the former Japanese Taiwan Army Headquarters Court. In the winter of 1944, twenty-four members of our Pudong Patriotic Salvation Army, including Shirong Li, took a sailboat to Ningbo for training. On the way, they encountered a storm and drifted to Daan Port in Taiwan, where they were discovered and captured by the enemy and sent to the Army Headquarters. Twenty of them were sentenced to death. Tadao Ito was one of the presiding judges. (2) Shiro Sakuraba, former Brigade Commander of the 82nd Brigade of the Japanese 20th Army, was declared not guilty. Shiro Sakuraba was accused of condoning his subordinates to massacre merchants and civilians in Zhuzhou, Hunan. An investigation found no evidence.</p>
<h3>All War Criminal Cases Have Been Tried; Military Tribunal to End at the End of February</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] All war criminal cases of the Military Tribunal have now been tried, and the court has decided to end at the end of February. According to published statistics, a total of more than 2,200 war criminal cases were accepted. 145 people were sentenced to death, more than 400 were sentenced to fixed-term or life imprisonment, and the rest were acquitted and repatriated. The sentenced criminals are still detained in the Jiangwan War Criminal Prison. If the situation deteriorates, they may be transferred to Taiwan for execution.</p>
<h3>Many Civil Servants from the Capital Arrive in Batches in Shanghai Awaiting Ships to Go South</h3>
<p>Many batches of civil servants and their families from Nanjing have arrived in Shanghai by train awaiting ships to go south. According to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, as of now, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Finance, and other important ministries and commissions have contacted the company requesting urgent ships. Their destinations are Fuzhou and Guangzhou. However, they are individually requesting the company to allocate ships, and there is no unified organization responsible for handling the evacuation, making it difficult for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to allocate ships. The company hopes that the Executive Yuan will send personnel to Shanghai to assist in the unified transportation work.</p>

<h3>US Consul General in Shanghai, Walter McConaughy, Delivers a Speech: Refuting the CCP's Anti-American Rhetoric</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 2) Briefly clarifying the accusation that US aircraft invaded China's airspace and sovereignty. No aircraft of the US government flew in China without the express consent of the legitimate authorities. Our planes fly over British territory and foreign planes fly over US territory in the same manner, and no one has ever felt that these planes are violating the sovereignty of Britain or the United States. We have neither requested nor obtained any special aviation rights anywhere in China. But we would like to know how the CCP views another strong country's agreement with China, according to which even the Chinese government cannot agree to the US Embassy's aircraft flying to Dihua.</p>
<p>What "Traitorous Conditions" Are You Referring To?</p>
<p>The detailed list also mentions "the many traitorous treaties signed by the National Government and the US government" and demands their abolition. The two most recent treaties we have signed with China were signed in 1943 and 1946. In the first treaty, we gave up our extraterritorial rights and the concession rights of the treaty ports.</p>
<p>If the Chinese Communist Party considers this a traitorous treaty and seeks to abolish it, then I want to make it clear to them that we are determined to refuse to reclaim our extraterritorial rights and port concessions—we are delighted that this infringement of Chinese sovereignty has ended.</p>
<p>Our other recent treaty, the Treaty of Commerce signed in 1946 and which only came into effect on November 30 last year, has replaced all existing unequal treaties. The purpose of this treaty is to replace them with one treaty. This treaty should recognize that China should be able to demand equal treatment when signing agreements with foreign countries. This is the first equal commercial treaty that the Chinese government has ever negotiated. I can't say whether this outstanding leader considers this treaty an unequal treaty - he didn't specify exactly which treaties he opposes and which articles in those treaties he considers exceptions. But if this does indeed refer to this treaty, then he is completely in agreement with my friend Gold, who believes that it is unfair. You should remember that Gold opposed this treaty with all his might on the entire back page of the "China Press." Perhaps I should ask the House Un-American Activities Committee to investigate the strange connection between these two warriors. However, in the United States, we can hear both sides of the opposition, so we can generally feel that we have reached a fairly fair middle ground.</p>
<p>Surplus Materials Agreement Used to Pay Off Debts</p>
<p>During the post-war period, we also signed several agreements with China regarding the implementation of affairs. One of them is the Surplus Materials Agreement of 1946. According to this agreement, we agreed to transfer surplus materials with a value of approximately 500 million US dollars (it should be specifically pointed out that guns, ammunition, military aircraft, and other combat supplies are clearly stipulated as not included), as well as some other things, to China. As for the above-mentioned other things, they are mainly used to offset the debts owed by our military personnel in China. We did not ask China to pay for the expenses of our military personnel in China, but we did ask our other allies to pay for the expenses of our military personnel stationed on their territories as part of the compensation for our lend-lease assistance. Is the Chinese Communist Party complaining about this? This is indeed the most obvious example of an unequal nature in any recent agreement we have signed with China. Under the Surplus Materials Agreement, the Chinese government agreed to set aside 20,000,000,000 yuan in Chinese currency to ensure that it would not become a burden on the Chinese economy—to establish an educational fund. Perhaps this is a shocking example of American cultural aggression, because this money must be used entirely in China. But even the Chinese Communist Party cannot criticize the many sums of money that our churches have spent on education in China for many years with noble intentions and caring love. But in the communist concept, the idea of trade is a forbidden thing, which is quite sad.</p>
<p>I don't think this statement might refer to the 1946 air transport agreement as a traitorous treaty, which is completely reciprocal in writing. Each party is allowed to operate three international routes. In fact, this agreement has greatly improved China's international transportation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Communist Party is referring to our aid agreement as a traitorous treaty. This is where the Communist Party's propaganda truly tries to denounce American imperialism—it says that our aid plan is completely a trap, the purpose of which is: (1) to enslave Chinese workers, and (2) to dispose of our surplus goods so that the tottering structure of our capitalist economy can be maintained for some time. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party has not elaborated on these ideas. Generally, they have discovered that in a place without freedom of speech, they do not need to prove their arguments. In any case, they have not explained why we should not help the Chinese government. It should be known that this government is recognized by all other governments as the sole legitimate authority in China, including the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Signing Agreements with the Aim of Benefiting the Chinese People</p>
<p>The facts regarding our aid plan are very simple. We have signed agreements, hoping to ensure that the aid can truly benefit the Chinese people. The few American die-hards who have insisted that American aid should be attached to political conditions will undoubtedly weep with shame and admit that they have wronged the State Department after hearing the following rumors, which are (if we believe the communist propaganda) that we have obtained important political privileges from the National Government without the public's knowledge. I must also correct this idea. We have never thought about political issues when providing various forms of aid. After the aid to China plan ends, the Chinese government does not have any permanent obligations to the United States. Since there is a traditional friendship between China and the United States, we do not insist on more rewards other than hoping that the aid can be used effectively. The purpose of our aid to China agreement is to help Chinese laborers. These agreements provide food to workers and their families, fuel and cotton to factories so that they can continue to operate, and clothing to workers. Today, there are materials worth millions of dollars in Shanghai. The United States is donating these materials to the Chinese people without thinking about material compensation. As long as this aid is beneficial to the Chinese people, the American people will be satisfied. The American people will never take the opportunity of China's disasters to seize selfish interests in China. Perhaps in this regard, the Chinese Communist Party will answer a question. Does the CCP welcome American aid or the aid of another country? The former is transporting materials worth millions of dollars into China without any cost, while the latter is taking everything that can be moved in the Northeast, and the quantity is not too small. This aid has cost China billions in machinery and other materials.</p>
<p>The communist propaganda materials ridiculed the Economic Cooperation Administration Director Paul Hoffman's remarks regarding American aid to communist areas. I have seen these propaganda materials, in which they ridiculed Hoffman's statement that if the ECA officials can supervise American aid and freely publish news about American aid, then American aid can continue a little. My last job was in a certain communist country in Southeast Europe, where the UN aid was used by the communist regime to reward those loyal to the communist party and punish those who did not believe in the communist party. Government propaganda praised the government's achievements in obtaining aid, but at the same time, it condemned the United States and the United Kingdom, which were the source of 90% of the aid, day and night. Is it because of this that the CCP believes that accepting Hoffman's conditions is detrimental to China's sovereignty?</p>
<p>Our aid plan also includes a rural construction agreement. I don't know if the communist party will consider this to be another imperialist plan to hinder the growth of Chinese crops and sell American agricultural machinery to Chinese farmers. But I do know that this is not what we mean. What we want to do is to help Chinese farmers make the most of their very limited fields. If the communist party considers this agreement to be of a traitorous nature, then let them elaborate on it as much as they like.</p>
<p>Transporting Large Quantities of Products to China Without Requiring Material Benefits</p>
<p>In short, it would be helpful if the communist propaganda could explain what material benefits we hope to gain by giving China a large amount of our products. No country has become rich in this way. It would be equally helpful if the communist propaganda could explain how we can give food, fuel, and raw materials to Chinese workers and at the same time promote our imperialist attempts. It should be known that Chinese workers use these raw materials to work, and we do not attach any permanent restrictions to the aid we provide. Furthermore, we can ask how these treaties can be abolished. The 1943 treaty does not include any provisions for abolition for obvious reasons. The 1946 treaty cannot be abolished within five years. We cannot imagine the Chinese Communist Party wanting to become a recognized treaty breaker like Hitler. Treaties can only be abolished in accordance with their own provisions or with the consent of the other party.</p>
<p>China's Land Privileges Were Lost in the Sino-Soviet Agreement</p>
<p>Since we are talking about unequal treaties, then it would be helpful if we could hear what the Chinese Communist Party intends to do with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945. Indeed, this is an unequal treaty and an example—as far as I know, this is the only important condition of an unequal nature that China is still involved in—because it gives privileges on Chinese land to a foreign country. When the American people hear the Chinese Communist Party denouncing traitorous treaties, the American people will generally believe in the sincerity of their denunciation if they demand the abolition of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945. The strange fact is that the United States seems to be more criticized in China for suggesting this treaty than the country that imposed this 19th-century traditional imperialist treaty on China. As for why the United States previously proposed this treaty, it was because it feared that something worse would happen. (Continued on page 5)</p>
<h3>Curfew Passes to Be Changed Starting February 1st</h3>
<p>A spokesperson for the Songhu Garrison Command told reporters yesterday that the curfew passes for the martial law period in the Songhu garrison area will be changed to new passes starting February 1st. The new passes are divided into three types: (1) passes held by personnel, light yellow for general purposes, and dark yellow for special purposes; (2) vehicle passes, blue for general purposes, and red for special purposes; and (3) ship passes, all of which are white.

<h3>Severance Pay for Huainan Railway Employees Resolved</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, more than 400 employees of the Huainan Railway Corporation, who had withdrawn from Huainan to Shanghai, went to the corporation's office on the second floor of the Jiangxi Road Construction Building to demand severance pay. At that time, the labor side demanded a minimum of five bolts of Dragon Head fine cloth and 2,000 gold yuan in cash per person, which was far from the conditions promised by the company. As a result, the situation was tense. The general manager of the company, Wenxun Cheng, telegraphed Director Yu of the police局 to send Section Chief Ling of the Huangpu Branch to mediate. The matter was satisfactorily resolved at 8:00 PM, with each employee receiving three bolts of Dragon Head fine cloth and 4,000 gold yuan.</p>

<h3>Shipping Association Organizes Distribution Agency, Plans to Operate Routes to Northern China, Decides to Send Representatives to Beiping to Negotiate with the Communist Side</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Due to the cessation of shipping to Northern China caused by the war, foreign shipping companies are seizing the opportunity to exploit the situation and plan to resume coastal trade with us. On January 21, a foreign ship of about 2,000 tons loaded cargo from Shidao to Hong Kong, and it is reported that two more ships will follow. The National Shipping Industry Association, in order to safeguard navigation rights and relieve the people's livelihood, has conducted multiple detailed discussions on restoring shipping to Northern China. They believe that foreign shipping companies should absolutely not be allowed to engage in our coastal trade, which would harm the interests of our entire nation. It was decided to plan and organize a unified distribution agency, designating ships to operate routes to Northern China. The association recently sent representatives to meet with Sun, the head of the Executive Yuan, to explain their views. Premier Sun expressed agreement in principle and approved the association to send representatives to negotiate with the Communist Party on the issue of navigation. The Shipping Association then requested Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong to convey the sincerity of the shipping industry to the Communist side. Shao and Zhang expressed their sympathy and agreed to support. Du Yuesheng, chairman of the Shipping Association, and Wei Wenhan, chairman of the Shanghai Association, telegraphed General Ye Jianying in Beiping yesterday, forwarding it to Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, stating the importance of safeguarding navigation rights and restoring shipping to Northern China, which is crucial to national interests and the people's economic well-being, and said that they planned to send representatives to Beiping immediately to discuss navigation methods. The association also convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday to discuss the candidates for representatives and navigation plans. It was decided that the representatives of the shipping industry to Beiping would be Wei Wenhan, chairman of the Shanghai Association, Zhang Qingnan, manager of the Tianjin branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and one representative from the seamen's organization, for a total of three representatives. At the same time, Shen Qi, secretary-general of the Shanghai Association of the Shipping Association, will accompany them to handle various documents. Currently, once the plan is finalized, the representatives will fly to Beiping to negotiate. It is also reported that in order to prevent foreign ships from entering the Yangtze River, the Shipping Association will take the same measures as those used for opening navigation on the Northern China route if the situation changes.</p>
<h3>Public Organizations Continue to Respond, Peace Promotion Association to be Convened</h3>
<p>The National Peace Promotion Association, initiated by the Municipal Council and scheduled to be held in Shanghai on February 10, continued to receive telegrams from the Nanjing Council, the Gansu Provincial Council, and the National Federation of Grain Industry Associations, expressing their support and stating that they would send representatives to Shanghai to attend. As of now, 30 public organizations nationwide have expressed their support for this peace promotion movement. The Municipal Council is currently carefully studying the rules of procedure and actively carrying out other relevant preparatory matters. If there are no special changes in the situation, the conference can be convened as scheduled.</p>
<h3>British Tram Company, Labor Dispute Resolved, Traffic Returns to Normal</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The labor dispute at the British Tram Company was resolved yesterday. The issue of borrowing wages will still be handled according to the three points jointly agreed upon by the authorities and the representatives of the Great Public Utilities, namely, borrowing wages for seven and a half days. The remaining salary for the second half of this month will be temporarily issued before the end of the lunar year according to the index of the first half of the month, and the difference will be made up after the index of the second half of the month is released. This morning, trams on all routes from the Jing'an Temple depot left the depot as usual at 5:30 am. Due to misunderstandings, some workers at the Ti Lan Qiao depot did not start driving out of the depot until 8 am after the union representatives explained the situation. Trams on all routes have returned to normal.</p>
<h3>Barber Industry Labor Dispute, Two and a Half Heads Resolved, Facial Treatment Costs 500 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The barber industry labor dispute, which had been delayed for many days, has been resolved, and all large and small barber shops in the city resumed business yesterday. The industry went on strike on the 21st. During this time at the end of the year, citizens felt the pain of having nowhere to get a facial treatment. After the resumption of business yesterday, all shops were crowded with customers, but the prices doubled. A facial treatment at a first-class barber shop now costs 500 yuan, 250 to 300 yuan at a mid-range shop, and about 150 yuan at a third-class shop. The labor and management sides have agreed to resolve the issue of the year-end bonus with two and a half heads after the price increase within the year, and the issue of adjusting the profit split will be negotiated by the labor and management sides themselves.</p>

<p>Wang Zhennan, the chief judge of the court, and Xu Shixian, the chief prosecutor, have both submitted their resignations to the Department of Judicial Administration. The vacancies have been filled by trial judge Jiang Shanchu and prosecutor Mao Jihe, respectively.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Regarding the abolition of the Special Criminal Court, the Shanghai Special Criminal Court has not yet received instructions from Beijing and is still operating as usual. However, the court currently has no cases to hear, so senior officials such as the chief clerk have not been attending court.</p>
<h3>Another Student from Jiaotong University Arrested</h3>

<h3>Passengers on Two Lines Anxious to Return Home, Train Order Increasingly Chaotic, Impossible to Improve for the Time Being</h3>
<p>The train order on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines remains chaotic, and the number of passengers traveling back and forth has increased unabated. The luggage room is piled high with luggage. Luggage transported from Beijing to Shanghai could be claimed at the latest the next day, but now it takes more than three days to wait, and it is still impossible to claim it. The express train to Beijing departing from Shanghai yesterday morning did not depart until after 11:00 am. Most passengers who purchased reserved seats could not get the seats they were supposed to sit in. All vehicles were packed with passengers, and even the roof of the car was full of passengers. Although the railway bureau has repeatedly advised them not to take such risks, they are anxious to return home and pay no attention to it. According to people in charge of the railway bureau: It is really impossible to improve this kind of congestion in the short term.</p>
<h3>Reserved Seat Cars Canceled Starting at Midnight Tonight</h3>
<p>[Another Report] Due to the chaotic train order, trains have been generally delayed for several days, ranging from four hours to more than ten hours. The biggest reason for the delay is the frequent military transportation, but another main reason is the expulsion of passengers without tickets occupying reserved seat cars. Therefore, the railway bureau has resolutely decided to cancel all reserved seat cars starting at midnight today.</p>

Because he was abused by the shop owner on weekdays, he ran away some days ago, and his whereabouts are unknown. His family is very anxious and hopes that anyone who knows his whereabouts will notify Cao Zhigeng at 789 Fahua West Town, West Shanghai. It will be an act of great merit.</p>

To add some festive cheer for the end of the year, the city relief society has specially issued ten yuan per person to buy meat to eat.</p>

If the staff of each porridge kitchen is willing to work as usual, the porridge distribution will still be maintained.</p>

<h3>Winter Vacation Passes Quickly, Donations Not Much, Please Save on Extravagance, To Help Impoverished Students</h3>
<p>The "Reader Scholarship Fund" sponsored by this newspaper has been soliciting donations since January 18, and it has been ten days now, but the total amount of donations is only more than 19,000 yuan, which is a pitifully small amount compared to our expected goal. The short winter vacation will soon pass in the blink of an eye, and the general impoverished children are worrying about the huge tuition fees that will soon be due. As for what good times and festivals, they simply have no share in them.</p>
<p>Dear readers, can you bear to watch them struggling in the threat of dropping out of school and economic hardship without giving a helping hand? We hope that every father, every mother, and young readers who are children can save a little extravagance in the Lunar New Year to help the poor young people.</p>
<p>New Year's Eve dinner, lucky money, firecrackers, candy... everything is a source of "scholarship money". Thrift is originally a virtue, and it would be even better to donate the savings to others, which is a combination of two beauties.</p>

<h3>Clothing Relief for Needy Children Nationwide, ECA Grants Huge Sum, Entrusts Ministry of Social Affairs to Manufacture, Transport, Store and Distribute</h3>
<p>The ECA here announced that it is now allocating funds to assist the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund and the Ministry of Social Affairs in implementing a clothing assistance program, which covers 800,000 needy children and mothers in 17 provinces in China. Yesterday, the ECA and the US Aid Utilization Committee handed over 32 million gold yuan to the Ministry of Social Affairs.

In addition to the 32 million gold yuan already handed over, the remainder will be allocated in two installments. The United Nations Children's Emergency Relief Fund will provide 3,073 bales of American cotton and cotton for winter clothing.

The purpose of this assistance is to ensure that the Ministry of Social Affairs' debt to the Children's Fund can be repaid on time so that the association can continue to work in China according to the original plan.</p>
<h3>Gang of Thugs Gang Rape Woman, Four Criminals to be Sentenced Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the case of thugs Yao Qilin, Xu Deming, Jin Zitong, Jiang Genbao, etc. gang-raping a weak woman, A Zhen, after the indictment by the District Procuratorate, Judge Wu Ronglin of the District Court brought the defendants Kaichun to trial yesterday morning. Except for Yao Qilin's confession of raping Lu once, the others denied the crime. After the debate ended, it was decided to pronounce the verdict this afternoon. The victim, Lu A Zhen, arrived in Shanghai by car from Wuxi on the evening of December 1 last year. When she arrived at Xujiahui, martial law had already been declared. Lu urgently went to the Huimin Inn on Guangyuan Road to stay, but it was already full. Lu then begged the tea house servant Cao Wenbin to find a way, which was seen by Yao and others. Yao and others thought that she was slightly attractive and was alone, so they tricked Lu into the inn and forcibly gang-raped her. Later, the police station received a report and arrested Yao and others together, transferred them to the District Procuratorate for detention in heavy shackles, and prohibited them from seeing their families. They were then prosecuted for rape.</p>
<h3>Rapidly Declining Year, Chaotic Situation, Neighborhoods Inquiring About Silver Dollar Prices, Stations Crowded with Evacuees</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The rapidly declining year and the heavy situation have not yet seen the light. The mood of the citizens of this city to welcome the Lunar New Year as usual is significantly less enthusiastic than in the past. On this New Year's Eve, because both buyers and sellers in various markets are watching the development of the situation, there are no major transactions, so the price fluctuations, except for vegetables, fish, meat, etc., are not as severe as imagined. According to statistics from the industries that need the most New Year's goods and incense candles every year, sales this year are abnormally sluggish due to the significant decline in the purchasing power of citizens. Most middle-class families do not have any special decorations. Only the frequent inquiries about the price of silver dollars can be heard between neighborhoods, and it seems that everyone wants to find a way to purchase and store them. Docks and stations are crowded with people evacuating from various places to here. Most of them seem to be coming to Shanghai for the first time, or need money to continue south, so many peddlers who guide and buy and sell travelers' clothes have appeared near the stations and docks. Most citizens seem to lack active interest in all entertainment, but they are more excited about all kinds of vividly depicted rumors. At night, because the martial law order still exists, the long streets are desolate. Only the long sound of gongs and drums occasionally comes from afar, reminding people that they are still spending the remaining years here.</p>
<h3>Stopping Robbery of Cotton, Apprentice Stabbed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhou Defu, 17, an apprentice at Liu Ziji Transportation Company at No. 47 Ninghai West Road, Hunanese, followed a truck to the Bund to load a large batch of cotton at around 1:00 pm yesterday. When he was about to set off, he was robbed by some poor women and children. Zhou jumped off the truck to stop the robbery and was stabbed in his left foot by a thug with a sharp blade. The perpetrators fled in all directions. The nearby police officer sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment in his car.</p>
<h3>Using Lost Check, Department Store Defrauded</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At around 4:00 pm on the 25th, a uniformed policeman No. 233 came to the Jiujiu Department Store at No. 227 Yunnan Road and selected one men's and one women's cotton sweater and a pair of black leather gloves, totaling 1,150 gold yuan. The policeman then paid a check from Qiankang Bank for 1,500 silver dollars, and the store gave him 350 yuan in change and took the goods away. However, at 10:00 am yesterday, the store sent employee Jiang Shunyuan to the bank to cash the check and discovered that the check had been lost by the account holder Qin Deyuan and had already been reported to Qiankang Bank as lost. Jiang Shunyuan was then detained by the bank and sent to the Lao Zha Police Station. After the police officer in charge asked Jiang about the details, he summoned the uniformed policeman and the security police team No. 233 to the station, but none of them were the policemen who bought the goods. The police fear that he is a dismissed policeman or an impersonator. It is hoped that all merchants will pay attention.</p>

<h3>Person Falls from Roof, Coincidentally</h3>

The store clerk reported it to the police sub-bureau in charge, and they sent an ambulance to the police hospital for treatment. The man claimed that his name was Wang Jingyao, he was from Henan, and he had escaped to Shanghai while retreating in Bengbu. Yesterday, he was discovered by his companion, climbed onto the roof in desperation, and accidentally fell down. Also, at around 9:00 pm last night, the same thing happened on the roof of a resident's house near the Xieqiao Bridge on Lujiabang Road in Nanshi. At that time, the resident immediately shouted "robber". The man, feeling guilty, lost his footing and fell from the roof. An ambulance was called and sent to the police hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he was unconscious, so his name is still unknown.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Cleaners from Soliciting Petty Gratuities</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Health Bureau has stipulated that the salaries of cleaners and the monthly fees for night soil carriers in the city are fixed, and all personnel must not solicit in violation of the regulations. They have been ordered to comply. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, it is feared that there may still be a small number of cases of greed and solicitation, so a public notice is issued to strictly order all relevant workers in the city to strictly abide by this.</p>

<h3>Gauze Market Trading Light, Closed for Six Days Starting Today, Market Opens on February 2nd</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn trend is stable, and there are very few transactions in the market. Most parties are handling the settlement procedures. The fluctuations of various yarns are narrow, and the results show a situation of mutual glory and disgrace.</p>
<p>42s Blue Phoenix opened at 74,500 yuan, then shouted up to 77,000 yuan midway, and finally loosened back to 74,000 yuan at the close, up 1,000 yuan from the previous day. 40s Blue Phoenix still stood firm at the previous day's original price of 70,500 yuan unchanged. 32s Silver Moon rose from 56,000 yuan to a maximum of 63,000 yuan, and closed at noon at 60,000 yuan, a slight increase of 1,000 yuan. 21s Double Horse spot opened at a low of 48,000 yuan, rose to 52,000 yuan at one point, and closed back to 50,000 yuan, a final increase of 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>20s Double Horse squeezed well by 1,000 yuan and closed at 44,000 yuan. Others such as Jincheng and Jinji also increased by 1,000 yuan each. The grades below 16s showed softening. The market will be closed for the Spring Festival holiday starting today and will resume trading as usual on February 2nd.</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, opening two grades, namely 32s double-strand Fengnian, priced at 70,000 yuan, and 80s double-strand TK Color Ball, priced at 223,000 yuan. As a result, only three households were approved to purchase, and five pieces were approved to purchase, with a value of 503,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market is tired and unable to rise. The atmosphere of selling was particularly strong yesterday morning. Many colleagues are settling accounts, and only Hankou helped slightly. The street shops also added some at low prices. There were more sellers than buyers in the market, and trading turned sluggish. The market was sluggish, and prices were fluctuating and falling.</p>
<p>Dragon Head fine cloth stepped down from 2,300 yuan to 2,250 yuan at the end. Five Fortune fine cloth was 2,000 yuan, and loose pieces were traded at 1,800 yuan. Trumpet Boy fine cloth opened at 1,930 yuan and closed at 1,820 yuan, down 160 yuan. In addition, B Dragon Head and Three Peach fine cloth also fell. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge opened at 2,000 yuan at the beginning, and once rose to 2,040 yuan, but before closing, there were more floating orders than actual transactions, and the momentum was unsustainable, and finally closed at 1,890 yuan, squeezed down 200 yuan. Jinlian Miaowu and Leifeng Pagoda Yuan Serge both hovered in the soft range. The market is scheduled to be closed starting today and issued a notice saying: "This market will be closed for six days for the Spring Festival holiday from the 27th of this year and will resume trading as usual on February 2 (the fifth day of the first lunar month)."</p>
<h3>Last Year's Exported Gauze</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It is reported that China Textile Construction Corporation's exports of gauze throughout the 37th year amounted to approximately 20,000 bales of yarn and 1.7 million bolts of cloth. Adding the amount of gauze exported by private factories, the total for the year is estimated to have earned back 40 million US dollars in foreign exchange.

<h3>This Year's National Treasury Revenue and Expenditure Matters Will Temporarily Be Handled with Reference to Old Subject Categories</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank recently sent a circular to all its branches, stating that it had approved a letter from the National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance, indicating that the 37th fiscal year of the National Treasury has ended, and the 38th fiscal year has begun. However, the central government's general budget for the 38th year has not yet been finalized into law. Therefore, the subject categories to be used for national treasury accounting this year cannot be compiled and sent. In order to avoid difficulties in handling matters after the start of the year, all revenue and expenditure matters of the National Treasury for the 38th year that have already occurred should still be handled with reference to the National Treasury Disbursement Accounting System and the subject categories for national treasury accounting for the second half of the 37th year. If there are any changes to the subject categories for the 38th year, they will be investigated and corrected separately.</p>
<h3>This Year's Taiwan Sugar Exports Will Be More Than Double Last Year's</h3>
<p>According to Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the crushing operations of all its factories in Taiwan for the 37th to 38th year period have partially begun. The total production is expected to reach the target of 400,000 metric tons. In order to earn foreign exchange and supply domestic consumption, the planned transportation and sales for this year are: (1) 50,000 tons for Taiwan Province, (2) 200,000 tons for domestic use, (3) 100,000 tons for Japan, and (4) 50,000 tons for Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the corporation's transportation and sales situation for the 36th to 37th year period was: (1) 30,000 tons for Taiwan Province, (2) approximately 120,000 tons for domestic use, (3) approximately 45,000 tons for Japan, and (4) approximately 25,000 tons for Southeast Asia.</p>
<h3>Overseas Remittance Income of the Bank of China Increases</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The amount of overseas remittances received by the Overseas Department of the Bank of China from various parts of Southeast Asia and the Americas has recently increased again. In the past, the daily receipt amount was about 30,000 US dollars. In the past two weeks, overseas remittance income has improved, and about 70,000 to 80,000 US dollars can be received daily. In recent days, it has increased to about 100,000 US dollars per day. It is reported that the important reasons for the recent increase in overseas remittance income are: (1) The Central Bank's overseas remittance rates are adjusted at any time according to the actual situation, so the difference from the black market rate is not far. (2) Remitting overseas remittances to various parts of the country through the black market is risky. If the exchange rate is not far from the black market, overseas Chinese mostly hope to remit to various places through the national bank.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics: Nominal Profits, Actual Losses</h3>
<p>Woolen fabric wholesalers, brokers in Qipan Street and Changle Teahouse, and market runners have decreased significantly. Most have returned to their hometowns for the New Year. Also, due to sluggish sales, both buyers and sellers are seeking to close their positions and wait quietly until the fifth or sixth day of the first lunar month to do business again. An investigation reveals that most woolen fabric businesses suffered nominal profits but actual losses after final settlement for the 37th year. According to the Gold Yuan conversions in the account books, there appear to be profits. However, when calculated based on the stockpiled goods, reduced quantity, and diminished weight, all are facing losses.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Province's Five Major Specialties See Increased Production</h3>
<p>According to returning visitors from Taiwan, the current five major specialties of Taiwan Province, bananas, citrus, tea, pineapples, and hats/mats, are as follows: (1) Bananas: The main producing areas are Taichung, Kaohsiung, and Tainan. The authorities have formulated a five-year banana revitalization plan. (According to the highest export record in 1940, 38,315,163 yuan and 17 cents were exported to Japan, the United States, and other places.) (2) Citrus: They are visible everywhere in the markets of the island. The Wentan pomelos of Tainan Prefecture are the most famous. The tangerines of the central and northern regions and the of the southern region, as well as the tangerines of Taipei Prefecture, have the highest production volume from mid-September to March or April of the following year each year. (3) Pineapples: Pineapple is the most famous specialty of Taiwan, with a history of processing and manufacturing for 40 years. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry recently has a five-year plan for canned pineapples, which can reach 2 million cases per year. The types are divided into foreign species and native species. The native species are further divided into red-skinned, yellow-skinned, and bird-skinned varieties. Because the fruits are smaller, they are not suitable for canning. The quality of foreign species is not inferior to that of Singapore and Hawaii and sells well in Europe. (4) Hats and Mats: They are a major side business on the island, with exquisite artistry and almost the exclusive profession of women in Taiwan Province. There are hundreds of thousands of these female workers, and they can produce more than 30 million pieces per year. (5) Tea: According to the planting area of tea trees in 1943, there were 40,793 hectares. After the war, the government actively reorganized to compete for the international market. Tea production is divided into more than 30 types. Black tea is fully fermented tea and has received many good reviews in the world tea market. Oolong tea is semi-fermented tea and has the strongest aroma. Pouchong tea is second. Currently, they are sold domestically in Fuzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Tianjin, and other places, and in foreign markets such as the Nanyang Islands, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and Russia.</p>

<h3>Silk Prices Fall Again</h3>
<p>The market situation of rayon yesterday continued to be weak. Most major dealers have stopped trading, and retail investors are still selling more. The market sentiment is weak, and the closing price of Nawi Lingxing was further squeezed.</p>
<p>After the No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 74,000 yuan, it was heard that the price of gold was stable, and the trend of other commodities outside the industry was hovering. People's hearts were indifferent to gains and losses, but because the end of the year was approaching, the surface was no longer supportive. Dealers wanted to sell, and the asking price was small. By the close of the market, it had fallen to 70,000 yuan, squeezing another 5,000 yuan. The afternoon market did not improve. The gold price rebounded strongly, but the price of goods was still low, and the trend continued to be sluggish. Tianqiao offered 67,000 yuan and 68,000 yuan for sale, which was shorter than the previous market.</p>
<p>The transaction of raw silk has come to an end, and there will be no good prospects this year. The market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates is still hovering between 170 yuan and 180 yuan, and people's hearts are mediocre. It was initially heard that the price of gold was stable. At the opening, superior zero-load offered 80,000 yuan for sale. Intermediate buyers cut prices, and the sellers could not hold on. The market situation continued to be weak, and it fell to 75,000 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, there was a supply of 72,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The market for silk fabrics is depressed, and the price trends of a range of goods are weak. The sentiment in the industry is mixed, and the market situation is first stable and then falling. Meiya quilt opened in the morning and offered 49,000 yuan, but there was no transaction for a while. Finally, the intention to sell gradually increased, and the market situation turned into a weak gear, once falling to 45,000 yuan. Near noon, because the money market was loose, the long orders were unwilling to lend at a low interest rate, and they turned to buying goods. The buying atmosphere in the market was slightly strong, and the decline stood firm. Finally, it closed at 46,500 yuan, and the closing price was squeezed again. The after-market offered 44,000 yuan, but there was no improvement.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Trade with the Netherlands</h3>
<p>Import Surplus of More Than Five Million Dutch Guilders</p>
<p>According to the Export Management Committee: China's trade with the Netherlands has been developing since the victory. It has improved especially in the second half of last year. According to the Dutch announcement, the trade statistics for January to September of last year are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) China imported 23.7 million Dutch guilders worth of goods from the Netherlands. (2) The Netherlands exported 28.83 million Dutch guilders worth of goods to China. The Netherlands had a trade surplus, while China had a trade deficit. In general, the trade volume between the two sides was very low in June. The three regions from which the Netherlands imported the most goods from China were the Dutch East Indies, with cotton textiles being the most important. What China imported from the Netherlands was mostly rubber, coconut oil, and Western medicine.</p>

<h3>"Reader Relief Fund" Calls for Donations, 29th Application Begins Today</h3>
<p>Our newspaper-sponsored "Reader Relief Fund," the 28th batch of aid grants for seven individuals, including Wang Huangshi, was completed yesterday. The 29th application begins today. The procedure involves preparing an application detailing the living conditions, certified by the local Bao chief or Jia chief with their official seals, and finding a guarantor from a shop, then mailing it via registered mail to the Social Service Department of the Shen Bao office on Hankou Road for review. Those verified as genuine by our staff will receive an appropriate amount of assistance, which, though small, expresses the sympathy of humanity.</p>
<p>Recently, prices have soared, and the amount of aid disbursed has also increased monthly, threatening the depletion of the original fund. However, the number of applicants continues to rise daily, and our staff regrets that this assistance cannot benefit all those in distress.</p>
<p>As the Lunar New Year is approaching, more expenses are typically incurred according to custom. We hope that enthusiastic readers will economize their expenditures and donate the savings as aid. This would not only benefit suffering compatriots but also delight our staff.</p>
<p>Lost Statement: Our reader, Zhu Junqing, lost his identity card, number 108752, from Lane 5, Jia 5, Bao 22, Luwan District. Due to financial difficulties, he is unable to publish an advertisement and hereby applies for its cancellation.</p>

<h3>Review of Two Major Policies in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Wu Shouren</p>
<p>[Taipei Airmail dispatch from Our Paper on the 20th] Chairman Chen Cheng has been in office for more than ten days. He has broken the traditional habits of the officialdom. The personnel issue has been as still as water. He has only added three staff members: a secretary, an advisor, and a commissioner. This kind of… though its persistence cannot be guaranteed, judging from his conversations with news reporters regarding personnel matters, he said he would completely obey the people's will. If the people think someone is needed, he will surely allow them to stay in their position. If the people think someone is not needed, he will never tolerate or show favoritism! The implication is that any future changes will be purely based on ability and integrity. While the wording seems tolerant, it is actually very strict. Compared to the practices of general officials, who, regardless of talent or foolishness, drastically change things, these two approaches are not the same. The compatriots in Taiwan have limitless respect for this wise action of his, especially since they know he is incorruptible and thrifty, and his private ethics are beyond what ordinary people can achieve. The extent of the Taiwanese people’s support for Chen suggests that his achievements in Taiwan are truly limitless.</p>
<p>In the week after taking office, Chen had frequent contact with various sectors. In addition to the guests and news reporters visiting him, he also repeatedly hosted group receptions for heads of the party, government, and military, as well as provincial and municipal councilors, National Assembly representatives, legislative and supervisory committee members, and central committee members. In these gatherings, he repeatedly put forward the slogan "People First, Livelihood First" and said that he had just taken on this important responsibility, that he does not deeply understand Taiwan, that several problems had not been researched, and that he could not yet provide a concrete report on future reforms.</p>
<p>Price Index Has Increased Wildly Since Restoration Three Years Ago</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation in Taiwan, on the surface, it does not have the devastation of the endless wars in the mainland, nor the misery of the countless refugees. The fluctuation of prices is not as drastic as in the mainland either. Who would not consider this small island a utopia, a paradise on earth? However, the compatriots in Taiwan and the people who have lived in Taiwan for a long time do not have this view. The reporter does not need to give many examples. Just taking the aspect of life, in the three years since the restoration, the retail price index has increased by 1,114,718 times, and this does not include the multiples that have been implicitly compensated for by the adjustment of the Taiwan exchange rate. To put it simply, abandoning the scientific statistical method of the index, the current general prices, with the exception of rice, are more expensive than those in Shanghai and Beijing by 60% to 100% for all daily necessities. Clothing is especially expensive. It is conceivable that the lives of Taiwanese compatriots are becoming increasingly difficult. If it were not for the food policy and the Taiwan dollar policy working together, we believe that the superficial stability in Taiwan today would no longer exist. But can the food policy and the Taiwan dollar policy maintain this stability for the long term?</p>
<p>Palliative Expedients Are Not Enough to Talk About Fundamental Cures</p>
<p>In fact, palliative expedients should never be regarded as thorough fundamental solutions. The reporter will try to analyze the reasons below: The effectiveness of the food policy is nothing more than two points: First, it enables the government to control a large amount of material goods; second, it is precisely because of these material goods that it can play a role in suppressing the price of grain to a certain extent, preventing it from rising higher. This kind of policy is of course well-intentioned and perfect, without flaws. Everyone should recognize its benefits to people's livelihoods. However, we know that the issue of people's livelihoods is by no means a simple food issue. Therefore, the success of Taiwan's food policy has only obtained a part of the help in the issue of people's livelihoods, and it is not the entire solution. Looking back at the facts, although the current rice price in Taiwan exceeds 1,000 Taiwan dollars per catty, it is about one-third cheaper than in Shanghai. Regardless of the difference between Taiwan and Shanghai in terms of producing and non-producing areas, and without studying whether this price is reasonable, we can still see that no one is panicking because of rice, because the government's material goods are constantly carrying out household rations, and public and special rations. The people who are not farmers do not need to worry about this supply. But what about the situation of the farmers? The price of rice exceeding 1,000 Taiwan dollars per catty is already an unprecedented and appalling price. Compared with other daily necessities, such as cloth, even if the reporter does not list its difference, as long as we refer to what was said before, it is 60% to 100% more expensive than Shanghai. We can imagine how large the disparity will be when exchanging food lower than Shanghai's for other daily necessities that are more expensive than Shanghai's. The total number of farm households in Taiwan is 323,121, of which only 3,401 are so-called large households. The income of large households is at least 11,100 kilograms per harvest. Although there is the burden of field tax, public school grain, surtax collection, and collection of more than 40% of the surplus grain, they still have a net surplus of 9,418 kilograms for each of the two annual harvests, so their lives are of course without problems. However, large households only account for slightly more than 1% of the farm households in the province. The income of most non-large households, who work hard and sweat blood, is of course even more minimal. It can be imagined how difficult it is to cope with the various living expenses. As for the public education personnel and the vast poor, although there is no problem with food, the salaries are meager, which puts them in a difficult situation. Not only is it impossible to support their parents and raise their children, but even taking care of their wives and children is often beyond their ability. Therefore, we feel that although Taiwan's food policy should be consistently implemented, if we rely on the food policy to boast about the stability of people's livelihoods, it is a matter of quoting out of context.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if the government wants the food policy to be unanimously supported by compatriots throughout the province, it seems that it must implement a parallel supporting policy. In other words, it is a comprehensive rationing of essential supplies for life. All necessary items within the standard of living should be rationed in terms of quantity and sold at universally flat prices. This is a great undertaking, and under Chairman Chen Cheng's slogan of "People First, Livelihood First," it is also a necessary task for the provincial government. We cannot deny that before the implementation of this great undertaking, there will certainly be many technical difficulties, such as household registration, funds, losses, and staff, all of which require a lot of preparation. However, the reporter believes that these difficulties should be overcome. First, Taiwan already has a very good foundation for household registration. As long as it is slightly reorganized, it can be made accurate, and people can be called upon to automatically correct past mistakes. Second, Taiwan banks have the right to issue funds. The banknotes needed for rationing cannot be considered an expansion of currency. Third, Taiwan has so many public enterprises, all of which are the result of 51 years of exploitation of compatriots in the province. In the past, due to waste in personnel, profits were minimal. In the future, management should be strengthened, and a portion of the profits should be used to offset rationing losses. Moreover, the province is rich in agricultural and mineral products, most of which are controlled by the government for unified transportation and sales at home and abroad. If managed properly, profits will be high, and a portion can also be used to offset losses. Fourth, the issue of staff is even easier. The Material Adjustment Committee in the province has a large organization and many personnel. In the past few months, it has only conducted several irregular quantitative rations, and other businesses have been criticized by the outside world, believing that it is competing with the people for profits. Although it is not necessary to say that it is so, if this agency really has value, it is most appropriate to have it handle the comprehensive rationing.</p>
<p>In Mr. Chen Cixiu's policy plan, there is also a sentence that the distribution of materials should be reasonable in the future. The so-called comprehensive rationing is just a more concrete way of saying it. Only after this concrete method is implemented can the province's food policy be thoroughly completed.</p>
<p>The Essence of Taiwan Dollar Policy Lies in Dynamic Adjustment</p>
<p>Secondly, to analyze the Taiwan dollar policy, the essence of the Taiwan dollar policy lies in dynamic adjustment. Its effectiveness is to reduce the magnitude of price fluctuations in Taiwan, but not to completely eliminate fluctuations. Strictly speaking, no matter how high the exchange rate of Taiwan dollars is adjusted, Taiwan prices are still far higher than those in the mainland. It can be seen that the price issue is a whole issue of supply and demand. Relying on raising the value of the currency is not a fundamental solution. Moreover, raising the value of Taiwan dollars also has its inevitable harms, which is that it has a serious impact on export businesses. There have been many examples in the past few months. When the Taiwan dollar resumed dynamic adjustment, the value of the gold yuan fell sharply from 1835 yuan to 1000 yuan, and then to 600 yuan. At that time, the province's export businesses almost faced the crisis of bankruptcy. This is the threat of the Taiwan exchange rate to the province's industry and commerce. Let's study how the Taiwan exchange rate affects the business of Taiwan banks. The reporter dares to judge that from the perspective of pure banking business, it is also harmful and useless. Everyone must still remember that not long after the Taiwan exchange rate resumed dynamic adjustment, Taiwan banks announced the method of suspending the exchange of remittances outside the province, and also limited the amount of legitimate commercial remittances to the lowest amount. Although this method is said to be implemented to prevent the influx of speculative funds from outside the province to stimulate Taiwan prices, according to economic theory, the construction and development of any place only welcomes foreign speculative funds to lead to the right track. Therefore, Taiwan is in urgent need of construction and development. If it is purely to prevent stimulating prices and suspend the exchange of remittances outside the province, is it not an act of abandoning the essentials and grasping the trivial, choking on food because of a fear of choking? Therefore, there must be unavoidable difficulties inside. The so-called unavoidable difficulties, to put it simply, are nothing more than the fear that there are too many gold yuan balances in hand. Every time the Taiwan exchange rate is adjusted, it will encounter a loss. The Taiwan exchange rate is constantly adjusted, and this kind of loss will continue to increase, eventually making Taiwan banks unable to bear it. At the same time, merchants' arbitrage will inevitably intensify, and the expansion of the Taiwan dollar is especially difficult to predict. Based on the above two established facts, we can understand that although the adjustment of the Taiwan dollar cannot completely erase the help to the people's livelihoods of the province, it is not a long-term plan that can be relied on.</p>
<p>The Success of the Taiwan Dollar Policy Requires Comprehensive Rationing First</p>
<p>So how can the Taiwan dollar policy be made to have all the benefits and no disadvantages? For the time being, focusing on the two phenomena mentioned above, the reporter believes that in terms of prices, it is also necessary to rely on the implementation of the comprehensive rationing of living items to complement each other. People's daily needs do not have to rely on merchants. Even if merchants arbitrarily seek excessive profits, no one will be subjected to this exploitation. As for luxury goods that are not needed for life, which have nothing to do with the living needs of the vast majority of people, a portion of the bourgeoisie bears high prices for luxurious enjoyment, which is within their capacity, and the government does not need to intervene. Secondly, after diluting the relationship between the Taiwan exchange rate and prices, there is no need for drastic adjustments. Taiwan banks can avoid losses, and exchange with provinces outside Taiwan can also be resumed, allowing speculative funds to come to Taiwan. The government wants a way to absorb them, leading them into legitimate investment paths. We believe that the construction and development of Taiwan will have the hope of achieving twice the results with half the effort.</p>
<p>From any perspective, under Chairman Chen Cheng's major premise of "People First, Livelihood First," the importance and necessity of implementing comprehensive rationing of living items really exceeds the measures of general economic construction. If people's livelihoods are not resolved, if we want to talk about economic construction, it is nothing more than looking for fish in trees. Even if comprehensive rationing of living items is implemented, it does not mean that the entire issue of people's livelihoods can be resolved, but at least the needs of each person's standard of living can be guaranteed. At the same time, the government will call on the people to work together for economic construction, mobilize to increase production, and improve the standard of living, which will surely make the entire province respond and be happy to serve.</p>

<h3>U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, Gives a Speech Refuting the Chinese Communist Party's Anti-American Arguments</h3>
<p>When Have U.S. Military Officers Ever Assisted in Combat in China?</p>
<p>[Continued from Page 4] We seem to have strayed quite far from the statement we were discussing, so let's get back to it. The next statement is that the U.S. Military Advisory Group participated in China's civil war. It would be interesting to know what evidence this statement is based on. Has the Communist Party ever captured any U.S. military officers assisting National Army operations in Jinan, Jinzhou, Shenyang, Xuzhou, or Tianjin? The fact is that the Communist Party knows that the U.S. Military Advisory Group did not participate in the civil war. Their orders absolutely forbade participation in China's civil war. The U.S. does not need power in China, nor does it want responsibility without power. The Advisory Group was sent to China before the mediation broke down, with the aim of implementing a long-term plan that would make another aggressor think twice before repeating Japan's mistake. It came to China with the full agreement of the Communist Party, and its intention was that the Communist Party's troops should be included in its training program (this intention was thwarted by the renewed outbreak of the civil war). Of course, the Communist Party must know that if the National Army was commanded by the U.S. Military Advisory Group, then their (National Army's) military operations would not have been so bad.</p>
<p>All U.S. Equipment Was Definitely Not Used for the Civil War</p>
<p>Next, we will discuss the matter of the aircraft, tanks, and artillery that we supplied to the Chinese National Army. The fact here is that most of the U.S. equipment owned by the National Army was supplied before July 1946. This was brought in by the U.S. to help China crush Japanese aggression and prevent the recurrence of aggression, not to be used in the civil war. The CCP should not forget that just four years ago, the U.S., the Kuomintang, and the CCP all had a common goal of resisting the Axis powers. Just as we oppose communism, we must not forget the CCP's many heroic deeds in the war of resistance against Japan or their service to our common goal.</p>
<p>Since we had re-equipped a large number of National Army troops with U.S. military equipment before July 1946, we certainly could not refuse to sell bullets to the National Government, which was cooperating with us, for these military equipment. When the opposing party is more obsequious in following a foreign party line, we also do not want to refuse the government to buy bullets. We declared our opposition to any foreign imperialist control of China in 1900, and we have always followed this same policy since then. We believe that this is not only in our own interest but also in China's interest, and we continue to think so. At that time, we were not supplying these weapons to slaughter the Chinese people. These weapons were for defending their freedom, resisting Japan or other foreigners who wanted to control China, and maintaining their own independence. We do not want China to sink under foreign tyranny against the will of the people, like many other ancient countries in Europe.</p>
<p>The entire statement I quoted implies that the Kuomintang is the U.S.'s follower, and that the Kuomintang authorities are our puppets and running dogs. If anyone thinks so, I urge them to read General Stilwell's works, which explain the extent to which our military officers were ignored in the China Theater. They can also look at the Kuomintang's official propaganda in Shanghai, which criticizes the U.S. far more than the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Is the CCP Blindly Following Moscow's Orders?</p>
<p>In this regard, I have a question to ask the Communist Party.</p>
<p>In June 1948, the Communist Party Information Bureau issued a communiqué condemning Tito and other leaders of the Yugoslav government. You might say that Yugoslavia is far away, so what does it have to do with China? In that communiqué, the Information Bureau explained that Tito's crime was in refusing to blindly obey the orders of the Moscow Politburo, in insisting that he had the right to interpret Marx and Lenin, in insisting on safeguarding the interests of Yugoslavia, and in uniting with non-Communist elements to form a national liberation front to govern Yugoslavia. For these reasons, he was called a Trotskyist traitor.</p>
<p>The CCP has openly and unreservedly agreed with this communiqué.</p>
<p>My question is, is the CCP blindly following Moscow's orders? If we infer from their approval of this communiqué and many other pieces of evidence that they are obeying Moscow's orders, then the Communist Party cannot think that we are wrong. The U.S. does not believe that the Chinese people are willing to be ruled by foreign orders. Based on traditional friendship, the U.S. has provided assistance to prevent this from happening. If we have not provided more assistance, it is mainly because we suspect whether the assistance can be used effectively, rather than because we lack the enthusiasm for assistance. We do not want to tell the Chinese government how to handle its affairs, thereby infringing on China's sovereignty. Those who accuse U.S. imperialism of controlling China may as well explain whether they themselves also accept instructions from another foreign country.</p>

<h3>The Xia Shu Murder-for-Money Case Has Not Been Tried for Half a Month</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Jurong, This Newspaper, 24th] The Local Court of this county was officially announced to be established by the Jiangsu High Court on November 23 of last year. Song Yufeng was appointed as the acting president of the court, and Mr. Song did not arrive in the county to assume his new role until December 24. However, the Chief Prosecutor's position has remained vacant, with no announcement from the Jiangsu High Court, resulting in the freezing of all civil and criminal cases, with no trial date in sight. In particular, the murder-for-money case in Xia Shu has been delayed for half a month, with no one sent to the scene for investigation. In Zhu Jiabian Village, Seventh Bao, Xia Shu Town, there lived the wife of Zhu Liantang. On the night of the 8th of this month, she was suddenly attacked by a murderer for money and died. Town Mayor Wang Xiaoxuan, along with the military judge of the military force, went to the scene and verified that the deceased's brains were splattered, confirming that she had been killed by a murderer before death. The next (9th) day, the deceased's son discovered a woman leaving the village with a package. After investigation, it was found to be the deceased's belongings. When questioned, she confessed that the murderers were Song Yizhi and three others. They were arrested at their respective addresses, and multiple pieces of murder weapons and stolen goods were seized and handed over to the county for handling. However, the Local Court has not been fully established, so the trial has not yet begun.</p>
