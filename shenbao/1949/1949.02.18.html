<h3>徐堪晉京作最後請示　新經濟方案將公佈　金銀自由賣買增強幣信</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財長徐堪昨仍在滬處理要公，新經濟方案實施前之微詢意見工作，已吿一段落。徐氏於昨夜至遲今晨晋京，謁李代總統，就此事作最後之諸示。據接近徐氏者表示：新方案之存在，已無問題，而金·銀之自由公開賣買，確有助於增强幣信，至少在短期間內如此。昨日午後本市之金融市塲，顯已感受此項新方案之影響，金融性商品於午後二十分鐘之內，因某項確息之傳到，在跌二成左右。至於辦法何日正式宣布，外界推測甚多。按徐氏晋京後，尙須赴穗將新方案提出於十九日政務會議通過。最可能之發表時間，當爲下週初。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十七日電〕據確息：當局對財經政策改革，已事在必行，將運用全力穩定幣値，吸收游責，以謀星建金圓信用，藉以打擊各地進行之地方改革幣制計劃。至改革新方案內容，俟徐部長返穗，卽可公布。財部發言人並否認將發行銀幣說，據稱：目前並無任何跡象，足以證明可能採用銀幣。又，此間工商界以輸管制度過嚴，連日向政院·財部，工商部等請求撤銷，頃據工商部負責人稱，該部已與財部會商切實改善辦法。另悉：新政策實施後，過去出口結匯及外匯移轉等辦法，將全部撤銷。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十七日電〕粵省參會駐委會曾通過歐裔明等提議，請穗綏署根據從前辦法，限制金圓券入境，幷禁止港幣流通，以安定金融，平抑物價一案。經參會以代電致綏署，請予執行。綏署現以旅客携帶金圓券入粵，箕攜帶數量自應照案執行。又：港幣流滿買賣亦已嚴令穗金管局及粵海關嚴厲執行禁止。</p>
<h3>滬銀錢業所提要求　擬定解決辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀·錢·信託三業公會，週前向財長徐堪所提之要求八點，聞國行及金管局已依據實際情形，擬定解決辦法，一經財部核定後，卽可付之實行。銀錢業所提之要求，重點如下：（一）本票餘額免送國行，而由行莊自行負責。（二）每日交換餘額，移轉聯合凖備車。以上兩點，當局認爲原則上無問題，但技術上値得硏究，在國行朱南遷前，不致實行，目前擬不予考慮。（三）申報之外匯資產，請發還外股部份。此點因環境關係，暫無實行可能。（四）存款凖備金中，美金公債之作價。原則上當局已同意修改，改變原定一比二十之匯率，新比率俟商討後再決定。（五）關於存款凖備金之利息，已由一角二分提髙至一角五分。（六）行莊存放款利率，公會可按市塲情形，隨時予以調整。（七）行莊增資後之驗資手續，現已加緊辦理，本月內可吿完竣。（八）行莊增資現金部份之動用，已依照原定辦法，分批動用。</p>
<h3>政府向美提出　三年援華計劃　六億貸款傳已獲同意</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十七日電〕據可靠方面透露，美國援華借款六億美元，已獲美方同意，一說雙方已簽訂合同，但官方尙未予以證實</p>
<p>〔聯合社廣州十七日電〕行政院長孫科昨向本社記者表示，不信蔣總統將東山再起。記者間孫氏是否以爲蔣氏將再積極領導政府，孫氏鄭重答曰：「否，蔣氏意欲長期退休」。孫氏在城南新造官邸接見記者，政府南遷後，孫氏招待外記者尙係初次。孫氏否認與李代總統意見分裂，據稱：南遷內閣與李代總統行動元全一致。預料留京其他主要行政機關將隨內閣遷粵，李代總統亦將來粵一行，但確切日期未定，總統辦公廳人員與一部份檔案業已運到此間。李代總統之準備來粵，足證內閣遷穗並非內閣單獨決定，而爲整個政府與李代總統磋商取得同意後出此。立法院會議不應在上海或南京，而應在廣州舉行，在粵開會可担保不受共黨干涉。台灣方面立法委負約一百二十名，已表示願與西南各省立法委員一百名在廣州開會，粵籍立委約六十名，主張在穗開會表決應在何處開會，此種提議具有民主作風。孫氏對於監察院昨在南京復會，並不重視，僅稱：全體會議將於三月間舉行。孫氏强調廣州宜爲首都時，微笑稱：「一且南京太熱，卽不堪居住時，余以爲各國大使亦將前來廣州」。孫氏談及對共和談問題稱：內閣尙未澈底討論或決定和談條件，上海和平代表團赴平後，尙無下文。余絕對相信李代總統決不接受形同投降之任何和平條件。中共反對聯合國機構調處，不知理由何在，惟國共雙方直接談判如能達到公正光榮的和平，亦屬佳事。孫氏否認其辭職之謠傳，認爲係上海一部份記者之揣測，實則絕無其事。孫氏透露，政府曾向經濟合作總署提出兩項計劃，要求於本年四月三日現行援華方案滿期後，繼續援助。此乃前行政院長翁文灝於去年十二月經濟合作總署署長雀夫曼來華時所提出，其中一項要求撥款八千萬美元，作爲四月三日後至六月底上財政年度結束時之臨時墊款。另一項要求美國實行三年援華計劃，自一九四九年七月起至一九五二年六月止，經費總額爲三十億元，性質與援歐計劃相似。經濟總署援華建設計劃七千萬元，原已停撥，但台灣與華南鐵路方面之建築經費將恢復撥發，駐華分署署長賴樸翰最近訪粵時，余已當面提出此議。余並要求經合署撥款三百五十萬元，完成黄埔港工程，內閣昨晨開會，撥出同樣數目經費，以改良該港，使容納一萬噸輪船，全部工程可於一年內完成。</p>
<h3>艾契遜談話</h3>
<p>晤顧大使時曾討論　中美重大利益事宜</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十六日電〕美國務卿艾契遜，十六日於招待記者會中，拒絕透露昨日彼與顧維鈞大使會談之詳情。艾氏於會上朱提及中國之時局，而於記者發問時，勉强答日：彼與顧大使會晤時，曾討論對中·美兩國均有重大利益之事宜，然未作任何決定。</p>
<h3>立院會期地點　尚待最後決定</h3>
<p>童冠　改今由滬返京</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕立院復會之日期及地點問題，現正待童院長自滬返京後作正式決定，童氏原擬於十六日夜車返京，因京滬路工人罷工未果，現已改定於十八日返京。十七日晚立院秘書長陳克文曾以長途電話與童院長聯絡，惟因童院長適外出未曾歸來，僅與其秘書通話，故對於立院復會日期，地點等，十七日尙未能決定。陳克文返京後，曾晋謁李代總統報吿。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北十七日電〕旅台立·監委對立·監兩院決議在京開會一節，目前尙無反應，在台立委一百卅餘人所組成之聯誼會，尙未收到該院在京開會之正式通知，彼等將於日內再度集會，商討此事。若干立委表示：京·滬兩地立委共有百餘人，合穗兩地共一百八十餘人，彼等將服從多數之決議，惟因種種關係，旅台立委勢須於三月初旬以後始能赴京。旅台監委共有廿餘人，十七日舉行座談會，對監院集會地點，曾經討論，惟未作結論。</p>

<p>〔本報鎭江十七日電〕駐鎭之海軍第二艦隊司令林邀，昨乘惠安號旗艦赴江北岸之三江營視察，迄今日仍留該地佈署防務。</p>
<p>〔本報江陰十七日電〕第一綏靖部以澄黄田港赴鎖後，江南物資匱乏，在不妨碍軍事原則下，特電縣府，准由地方機關組經理委員會，縣長爲主任，進出貨物酌收綏靖費，港口加强檢査，北岸商人過江應指定住處，監視行動，所需物資開單由商會代辦，俟組織完善，卽可開放。</p>
<h3>江北共軍躍躍欲試　口岸以北開到二萬餘人　並在各湖興建大批木船</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江十七日電〕據空軍偵察報吿，口岸以北十餘華里處之刁家舖，昨開到共軍一部約兩萬餘人，番號及企圖均不詳。</p>
<p>〔本報浦口十七日電〕共軍近在洪澤·高郵·寳應·邵伯等湖興建木船，益爲積極，十五日據空軍偵察，已有木船三百餘艘，分由寳應·髙郵等湖南駛。另南通天生港·蘆涇港·任港一帶共軍亦在發動木匠，修建大量八漿木船。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕土共江髙·西山等獨立團曁揚州顧維衡部共千餘，十六日夜向揚州以南國軍橋頭堡前進陣地施家橋方面竄犯，經國軍王作華部堵擊兩小時，共軍於傷亡二百餘名後不支北退。又，靖江城十五日突由黄橋方面開到共軍長江縱隊四千餘，江陰對岸八圩國軍橋頭陣地已予戒備。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕江北共軍長江縱隊，頃在南通以下狼山軍山一帶沿江地段，積極興築江防工事，同時並將天生港·蘆涇港·任港等碼頭設備澈底破壞，所以防阻登陸。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江十七日電〕共軍新六團興化獨立團兩部共約二千餘人，昨晚十時向六圩以北之施家橋國軍陣地進犯，經駐軍迎擊，砲戰竟夜，迄今日拂曉，共軍已後退，木日鎭江南面自儀徵迄口岸一綫無何接觸，國軍仍加强戒備中，空軍亦不斷飛臨長江北岸偵察。</p>
<p>〔本報江陰十六日電〕靖江共軍獨立團等，一度在八圩港十圩橋等處與國軍發生前哨戰，未幾仍向北退去。聞共軍入靖江城時，若干機關人員曾遭逮捕。</p>
<p>〔本報浦口十七日電〕和縣方面士共一百餘，十六日午夜向烏江國軍橋頭陣地一度來擾，經李延年兵團所部還擊後，十七日拂曉前，共軍卽循原路退去。至津浦正面東西葛方面，十六日·十七日仍平靜無戰事。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十七日電〕在長江北岸像展開了雙翼的巨鷺似地列開陣地的共軍，迄未對國軍尙在北岸的橋頭堡施展壓力。據此間軍事方面十七日稱：此項事實卽可指出共軍並無在最近將來强渡長江的企圖。此等人士認爲共軍的渡江攻勢將採集中攻擊的方式，地點最可能在蕪湖，因共軍可能在此處建立直下杭州的攻擊綫，以截斷京滬地區國軍的後路。渠等稱：共軍的一貫戰略，不以攻佔城市爲主要目標，而係在戰塲上，殱滅國軍主力，如共軍從正面直攻京滬而未截斷後路，則國軍在必要時將能南撤。另一方面，共軍壓方的减輕，或可認爲共方瞭解渡江必須議牲大量人力，而和談則可能避免此項犧牲，如和談成功，則共方可不費一兵一卒，渡過長江。</p>
<p>軍事方面稱：林彪所部共軍的自平津區南下，目前尙無跡象，但在最後的渡江攻勢必須開始時，則林彪部的南下殊屬可能。至陳毅部之共軍，目前正結集在淮安·天長·滁縣·巢縣等地整補中。</p>

<p>〔聯合社南京十七日電〕此間海軍人士今日稱，海軍巡邏艇一艘在長江進戈，司令官瞥見北岸有人叫賣鲜肉，意欲一換口味，遂命駛近北岸，當被共軍利用小販誘使政府海軍解除武裝，並將該艇焚毀。</p>

<p>〔聯合社北平十七日電〕北平市長葉劍英，昨日再度訪問上海和平代表團顏惠慶等人，與之作長談，詳情未悉。衆信，類氏等現正設法勸使共方緩和其對戰犯問題之態度。</p>
<p>〔合衆社舊金山十七日電〕中共電台十七日廣播稱：過去一月中之各項發展，顯示李代總統於上月廿二日所宣布之和平措置毫無價値，因李氏之命令現幷未爲人遵行。廣播稱：自李氏宣布政府有意「排除一切和平之障碍」後，渠宣布之若干措置，已爲行政院所取消。該廣播指釋放張學良及楊虎城之命令爲「滑稽劇」，蓋命令未曾遵行，李氏私人代表赴台後，亦未能加以執行。廣播指斥李宗仁「僅足欺騙指民，而蔣介石在幕後拉綫」。廣播指京滬警備總司令湯恩伯為「戰犯」，並抨擊某維持治安及禁止罷工之措價。</p>

<p>〔本報廣州十七日電〕行政院副院長吳鐵城語本報記者，渠將於十八日自穗飛京，謁李副總統，有所商討，至孫院長何時返京，渠稱尙未有決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕日來甚為慶上之孫科院長辭職謠言，十七日總統府第二局工黃雪邨接見記者時，再度體明其不確。據黄氏談：李代總統於日前尙有電致孫氏慰問其血壓髙之病况，請其善自調攝，一俟血壓稍平，卽請來京。十七日滬並傅李代總統對孫氏辭戰已予批准之說，完全無稽。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕行政院副秘書長倪烱聲十七日午告記者稱：政院留京聯合辦事處，可於數日內正式成立，各部會駐京負責人日內來京。倪氏並稱：各部曾駐京人員皆爲髙級人負，政務自可切實推進，該處職權已有規定：（一）來文，來電須就地解決應付，並可逕行處理者，卽由倪副秘書長處理。（二）其須就地解決應付，惟有關經費或事由較重大者，卽電穗請示。（三）無須就地解決應付者，一律原件包封寄穗處理。至外傳倪副秘書畏曾電請孫院長對各部曾駐京人選應特別愼重一節，據悉並無其事。</p>

<h3>維持交通安定社會！</h3>
<p>京滬杭地處大江之南，交通棄稱便利，迄至目前與戰區尙有一江相隔，而近兩月來交通情形已陷於混亂狀態，且有江河日下之勢。影響所及，上海市區公共交通工具，亦常因故停駛。尤其是最近半個月中更變本加厲，交通秩序之混亂，已達極度。本月一日，先是法商電車一度停駛，兩路行車調度所横遭搗毀。二日法商電汽車寫蔡間被毀。三日法商電汽車司機售票與軍人衝突，罷工抗議。八日兩路路工包圍管理局要求改善待遇，各班列車完全停駛。同日市公共汽車員工因待遇問題實行怠工。九日兩路工潮重起波折，兩路車輛再吿停駛。十五十六兩日兩路工　擴大，六千路工集體請願，京滬滬杭兩綫車輛竟日停頓。而同日市區公共汽車員工又爲要求應變費未遂，全體停工。此外例如請願團體阻礙交通，或旅客搶擠車輛，跌傷摔死之類，更是數見不鮮，眞有叫人寸步難行之歎。</p>
<p>像這類情形，若發生於敵軍兵臨城下之日，固猶可說；若發生於交通梗塞之偏僻地區，亦不足爲奇。但以此時此地，共軍頓兵長江以北，並無波江跡象，而江防固若金湯，大江以南，安若磐石，人民固然不必爭先恐後搶奪交通工具，管制機構也應該鎭定調度，維持秩序。縱有軍事需要，亦當按照順序，加開班車。至於交通機構，一般員工待遇，雖然菲薄，但亦不致並普通公敎人員而不如，即因物價暴漲，無法維持生計，亦應合法申請，調整改善。這些本是員工與主管者直接交涉洽商的問題，亦即交通機構內部之事務。但主管當局旣不能防範於未然，尤不能善爲處理，息事弭爭於事發之際，終使工潮一再拖延擴大。員工更不知顧全大局，動輒以怠工，罷工，請願，包圍相要挾。竟使車輛行駛一日數斷，公共交通陷於停頓。而尤可異者，禁止罷工及集中要挾，早有煌煌布吿，而竟視同廢紙。像這樣支離混亂，叫囂吵鬧，還成什麽體統，還像什麽社會！乃同時平津消息傳來，以北平爲中心的鐵路交通，似反在逐漸恢復之中，不問共黨如何處理這些問題，而其行政效率之超過於我們的政府，恐即在政府中人或亦不能否認。</p>
<p>兩路風潮昨日雖已大致解決，而社會動盪因素依然存在，此類風潮仍有此伏彼起之勢。再看我們國家已瀕臨到風雨飄搖，岌岌不可終日的險境，但也是千載一時起死回生的關頭。中央政府正竭誠謀取和平，盡力革新政治。全國機關團體員工人民之宜如何共體時艱，協力同心，渡過當前難關，一致朝向革新政治和改善經濟的前途邁進。尤其是維持公共交通，安定社會秩序，更是人人有責。</p>
<p>社會風氣之良窳，原是繫於人心之振靡。倘若整個社會都充滿了横暴，自私，爭奪，無賴，以致於叫囂，鬥毆，破壞，到處只見一片混亂，而當局者又都只會貪汚而辦事無能，那麽，人類的禮貌，義氣，廉介，和羞恥，究竟到什麽地方去了。而國家設官分職，地方要宜吿戒嚴，又爲的是什麼？至於國家意識，社會觀念，那更無從談起！</p>
<p>我們熱烈地期待着李代總統整肅官常軍紀，達成革新政治之目標；更希望革新政治不要忘記改善經濟，穩定幣値，抑平物價，進而改善公敎員工以及一般薪給待遇。尤其是維持公共交通，安定社會秩序，更是刻不容緩之事。於此，更願全國同胞三復管子的四維之言，配合政治革新，經濟改善，而共同來轉移社會風氣二。</p>
<h3>共黨未停止軍事行動　各地有堆星戰事　國防部發表一週戰局</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕國防部頃發表一十日至十六日一週戰局如次：</p>
<p>週來政府繼續誠意謀和，但共黨迄未停止其軍事行動，茲將各地零星戰况概述如后：長江方面，江北共軍陳毅部，自十三日起（農曆元元宵後一日）全綫向南移動，刻在高郵·天長·明光·巢縣·合肥等地集結，現蚱埠淮陰以北地區無共軍主力，兩浦地區情况尙無大變化。烏衣附近有少數共軍出沒其間。陳毅所部第六。第七兩縱隊，刻在合肥附近整補。巢縣·和縣一帶，連日共軍亦有增加，活動較前積極，附近所有船隻·馬乾·燃料·食糧·壯丁均被徵掠一空，該方面共軍似正積極補充新兵，收集糧食，作渡江準備。至於采石附近少數土共，已被國軍肅淸。長江下游，國軍某部曾於十日起向南通天生港連續施行反擊，予共軍以相當損傷，刻以任務達成，已安返原防。議徵情勢轉穩，共軍後撤十五里，該地秩序刻已恢復正常。江陰要塞一帶，我陸海軍防範嚴密，外傳曾有小股共軍偸渡，絕對不確。</p>
<p>華中方面，漢瑛綫上陳賡所部共軍，仍在唐河一帶，無大變化。信陽，確山，駐馬店四週，尙無共軍活動。一部共軍於週前迂迥南下。李先念統率之第十縱隊，江漢縱隊及新一旅等部，竄陷荆門後，曾竄至十里舖，團林舖附近，旋國軍於十六日上午十時收復荆門，原據荆門共軍向東逃竄，我軍爲確保宜昌，沙市外圍之安全，正分路向熊口東南直露河一帶之共軍李人林部出擊。此外，我安陸，應城，江陵各地國軍，亦向週邊展開淸剿行動，以阻遏共軍的局部攻勢，藉保長江上游的安全。其他太原及陜北方面，本週無電要戰事。政府謀取全面和平，已盡了最大努力，今後能否和平停戰，已臨共黨對和平有無誠意的最後考驗時期。</p>

<p>〔本報漢口十七日電〕粵漢路員工發生內訌，部份員工組織護路運動，主張挽留杜鎭遠局長，要求交部收回袁夢鴻接長該路成命，並指社局長被迫請辭，係少數人所鼓動。但另一部份員工，則認杜氏因循貽誤，造成路政國敗結果，主張杜氏不應變棧。</p>

<h3>自波羅的海以迄地中海　構築大規模防空綱　美準備供英大批飛行堡壘</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十七日電〕西歐聯盟各國現正設立大規模之雷達防空　，北自波羅的海起，南迄地中海止。此事可於英政府昨日發表之國防白皮書見之。據稱，英國已將地面雷達配備供給法·比·荷·盧四國，以使完成統一之防空網。另據官方消息，卽將設立雷達防空總部，自德境英軍佔領區波羅的海要港呂伯克至法國地中海洽岸各防空站，均歸其指揮，德境英佔區雷達防空站亦將併入該一防空網之內。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫數十六日電〕西歐聯盟正加緊構築雷達圍牆，以防衛任何意外空襲。英政府白皮書暗示電子「東牆」正在建築中。英方消息稱，隱蔽之雷達站，將沿五國邊界設立，並非常緊密，以組成一不可見之網，足以探聽較少之火箭及敵機。如發現任何可疑的空中動作，總部卽令各站追隨此形跡可疑飛機，同時並令戰鬥機及髙射砲凖備作戰。此種制度可使在戰時曾予德機重大打擊之防空綱加倍　有效。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十七日電〕「每日電訊」報今日載稱，英美政府現正談判美國B廿九型之空中堡壘一百五十架交與英空軍。又稱，此卽英國十五日公佈之國防白皮書上未提及新轟炸機之原因。</p>
<h3>大西洋公約談判進行中　美重申政策與目標　政府國會見解並無鑿枘</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕國務卿艾契遜今日堅決聲明美國對北大西洋公約態度未變。至於美國在該約中將担負何種確切義務，艾氏未加說明，僅稱尙在談判中。</p>
<p>艾氏並一再提及美國對於該約之目標及政策稱，關於此一方面，國務院與參院兩黨一致外交政策領導者康納利范登堡之間，見解並無鑒柄，吾人正循明白規定之政策與各關係國進行談判。此種政策最近曾由杜魯門總統於就職演說中揭示，當初則曾見之於參衆兩院去年六月之決議案。卽所謂范登堡決議，「在原則上美國根據憲法程序參與區域及其他集體措置，惟此等措置必須以繼續不斷之有效自助與互助爲基礎，並與美國之安全有關者」。該決議又謂，此等措置應按照聯合國憲章之目的原則與條款，供自衛之用。</p>
<p>有效期二十年</p>
<p>至於該約時效之久暫關係，各國亦尙未獲得同意，仍在一併討論中。歐洲各國大致主張以五十年爲期，國務院則認爲不得超過二十年，惟在期滿時得續訂。</p>
<p>安全保障條款</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕參院外委會主席康納利對於北大西洋安全條約中之保障條款，主張規定如下：「簽字國之一如遭遇武裝攻擊時，其他關係國爲行使聯合國憲章第五十一條所承認之集體自衛權起見，得個別或會同採取必要辦法，以維護北大西洋區之安全。」國務院對於此種條文之措辭是否滿意，尙未確定。艾契遜最近曾謂，「吾人會同關係各國維護和平之最大貢獻，要在預先切實聲明任何國武裝攻擊我國安全者，必以壓倒之力迎擊之。」</p>
<h3>土耳其主張締結　地中海聯盟</h3>
<p>與大西洋公約相連緊</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十七召廣播：巴黎訊，土耳其外長沙達克頃稱，大西洋公約因參加各國囿於地域觀念，故土耳其不能參加，但爲確保歐洲和平起見，大西洋公約以外，地中海各國亟應組成「集團」。沙氏係來巴黎參加歐洲經濟合作會議者。</p>

<h3>國行昨日仍未拋紗　今後將採機動政策</h3>
<p>連日國行停止在市塲拋紗，引起紗布連續上竄。各方對此，極爲關切。昨日仍未見有紗拋出，記者以此見詢，國行某髙級負責人稱，今後對在市塲拋紗一節，業已決定不復逐日拋出，而將採取機動政策云。</p>
<p>又訊，國行停拋紗布，係暫時情形，一二日內卽可恢復。因國行鑒於金價上漲更甚，已大量改拋黄金，此在收縮通貨方面言，實較拋售紗布有效云，</p>
<h3>紗市跌多漲少</h3>
<p>棉紗暴漲暴落，過程起伏甚鉅。晨開各方買氣激昂，漲力驟盛。近午漲勢突吿不支，各紗急轉直瀉，結果呈漲少跌多之勢。四二支藍鳳初爲七十一萬元，較前髙九萬元，最後慘跌至五十九萬元收市，反跌三萬元。三二支銀月微挫一萬五千元，以四十五萬元結局。二一支雙馬現出，自三十八萬五千元一致信至四十萬元大關，午收回小至三十四萬元，終降二萬元，隔日出爲三十五萬五千元。二〇支雙馬仍站住上日三十三萬之原檔未動。他若金鷄與天女等，則榮辱互見，一六支光明退入三十萬元關內，爲二十九萬五千元，軋小一萬元。其他一〇支紗等，亦吿軟化。</p>
<h3>棉布又見新價</h3>
<p>布市晨開塲內利多消息頻傳，人心極度振奮，一般執戶咸不思出，本客則相偕搜購，檯面帮亦趁勢拉提，各布乃欣欣向榮，俱呈空前新價。龍頭細布塲內大致喊一萬六千元左右，但以籌碼奇緊，無貨供應，呈有市無貨之勢。喇叭童細布由一萬四千四百元開出，曾低見一萬三千七百元後，又吿回堅，終以一萬三千九百元收市，較前髙一千九百元。B龍頭細布初開一萬四千一百元，一度曾喊小至一萬三千元，午後復升至一萬三千七百元，終挺一千七百元。四君子元嗶嘰終以一萬四千四百元開出，最低曾喊過一萬三千七百元，收前又漲達一萬四千五百五十元，終爲一萬四千三百五十元，軋升一千七百元。四君子元直貢亦挺一千七百元，以一萬三千九百元結束，午後趨勢略鬆，聞四君子元嗶嘰塲外喊一萬三千元。</p>
<h3>銀根走勢平穩</h3>

<p>又訊：昨日市銀行代理市庫，亦有近億元撥付，大致爲地方機關本月員工薪津及經費云。</p>
<p>昨日市問銀根，走勢趨向平穩。緣外埠匯款有到，業內行莊單子呈裕，外供較多，然若干貨帮間因週轉關係，仍有捉襟見肘之象。市塲拆息，髙做日拆九十元，低則七十元，亦有供出，大致站八十元模樣。</p>
<p>現鈔籌碼，速日因工商發薪，不敷應付，本票仍見流行，貼水最髙昂至百分之六或七。</p>

<h3>銀樓復業問題</h3>
<p>金管局迄未接奉指示</p>

<h3>四礦聯營處　煤價又漲</h3>
<p>據四礦聯營處悉，該處配煤價，昨再度調整，因受外匯移轉證以及台灣運輸價格一再提髙之影響。本國烟煤每噸增至三萬零二百十一元，較前上漲二千二百十一元。外國白煤升爲四萬六千一百八十四元，較前漲上五千七百十八元。白煤納子及小子均爲三萬八千元，較前上漲達六千元。白煤塊漲一萬三千元，爲五萬八千元。白煤屑漲七千元，爲三萬二千元。以上價格，均係浦東碼頭交貨。浦西麥根路煤棧交貨，則每噸需另加三千七百元云。</p>
<h3>絲綢市況恍惚</h3>
<p>生絲優級另担，昨初開爲五八〇〇〇〇元，嗣因人心恍惚，觀望者多，價乃回小至五四〇〇〇〇元，旋以利多消息紛傳，價再回升至六〇〇〇〇〇元，至午收時復又回小至五六〇〇〇〇元，較前午收市升六萬元左右，與前晚收市比，反跌萬元許。</p>

<h3>貨主扳持甚力　食米高峯挺進　南市場白粳曾做萬五百元</h3>
<p>米市挺升未已，昨日再向髙峯挺進，因黑市金價仍髙，人心跟踪看漲，貨主扳價甚力，南市塲上漲較北市爲多。白粳開市一萬〇二三百，一度做一萬〇五百元，收市略見回軟，爲一萬〇三百元，升八百元。薄稻一萬〇四百，早稻秈米等普遍漲七八百元。北市因上日價格過髙，致銷路呆滯，略漲百元，白粳一萬〇一百元，二市塲登記到貨，共計六千七百四十九石。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>開市再挺，收市轉疲，終與上日相仿，晨開人心堅昻如故，各油普漲三千元，豆油初做五萬一千，後市因暗息高昻，納戶稀少，業外價低，價步退至四萬九千元，與上日價疋平。生菜油收市四萬四千元，吉桶生油五萬二千元，熟菜油等一致上漲後回。豆餅收市市價與上日相平。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>漲勢持續，開市後以金鈔續挺，市塲銀根轉鬆，進戶納胃濃厚，兵船老車普挺三百元以上，中市業外各物轉疲，曾一度下跌，後以客帮紛紛納取，執戶乘機扳抬，收市復見回挺，兵船臨收回站四千五百二十元髙峯，老車升做四千七百三十元。後市喊價達四千八百元。麩皮客帮納進頗力，激升成餘，阜豐大包高做三千五百二十元，建成小包臨收二千一百八十元。</p>
<p>食糧</p>
<p>漲風仍熾，黄豆到貨銳减，乍豆在貨主扳持下，車豆未見做開，昨略有成交，價站八千五百元髙峯，車豆疾升成半，生仁芝蔴油廠吸取不遺餘力，市勢續挺一成以上。苞米紅糧齊破四千關，菉豆客帮問津，破萬元大關。</p>

<h3>制革工業危殆</h3>
<p>原料飛漲成本增髙</p>
<p>本市製革工業，遭遇嚴重危機，（一）原來製革需要之生牛皮，全來自徐蚌一帶，現來源幾吿斷絕，致原料飛漲，成品價格反低于成本。（二）製革過程，極爲複雜，恒需數月，週轉不良，物價一日數變，困難萬分。（三）牛皮又爲出口貨之一，來源缺乏之際，再加出口，本市供不應求，有失正常調劑。現該業正請求工商業部禁止牛皮出口中。又本市皮革廠共計三七〇家，其中屬于手工製革者，佔十分之八。機製及半機製佔十分之一，每月產量計機製底皮五三萬磅，綠皮二〇萬磅，手工底皮十八萬磅，面子皮七八萬磅，其他如摩薩哥皮司偉皮及沙廠皮帶，牛皮箱皮等，皆出產頗豐，每月所需乾牛皮爲一四〇萬磅。</p>
<h3>茶市做開不多</h3>
<p>連日漲風洶湧之茶市，昨買戶仍搜求殷切，而貨方居奇扳售，趨勢依然不餒。惟交易則因供求失調，遂猶寥寥做開。茲悉：本市元隆。春記。同泰祥。等茶行，鑒於蘇錫各地茶銷蟬聯，故目前均擬展開新春攻勢，對於各項花色，企圖侵襲云。</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽　回力師殘將疲　再遭滬警擊敗　洋兵會師恩卡斯勝麥令斯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕這幾天回力同晨友（化身滬警）老是作對頭，昨晚四屆籃球聯賽中，滬警又戰回力，滬警人材濟濟，回力後備軍缺乏，最後七分鐘，僅留四人作戰，師殘將疲，困苦萬分，結果六八比六一敗於滬警，上半時卅四比廿五，相差九分。</p>
<p>比賽中精采果屬不少，千餘球迷，有目共賞，但對方因過份注意了比賽的勝負，遂在緊強的局面中，時常想運用那犯規的小按巧，未免美中不足。另有甲二組一塲，無名卅七比卅五勝華南，上午時十八比十五，甲一組恩卡斯四七比卅三勝麥令，上半時廿五比十六。</p>
<h3>戰情記</h3>
<p>寃家狹路，回力晨友又相逢聯賽中，連戰兩天，雙方的精神，都堪欽佩。回力王永芳張浦，田福海，曹志吉，魏啓崑，滬警史久全，王伯文，王蓉生，梁雄標，何金貴。比賽開始，祗聽得『九號拉人！』曹志吉兩隻　球落空，曹再罰得一分，王伯文還報顏色，田福海籃下托入，志吉劉郎重來，五比二回力成風。伯文金貴啓崑，表演投籃，滬警八比七超出。何增替梁雄標，傳其俠代蓉生，十一比七回力暫停。不久回力徐叔沅換出曹志吉，福海加油，還相差一隻球。這裏是回力抬頭的機會，無奈他們沒有把握住，十九比十五蓉生代金貴。裁判員在『滬警』『晨友』隨便喊，原來他們是換湯不換藥，廿五比十八回力曹徐復位，張浦很能利用時間空間，不幸後來抽筋，未能終塲，啓崑上去就命中，甚爲球迷歡迎，上半時卅四比廿五，滬警跑在前面。</p>
<p>休息再殺，啓崑永芳立添五分，卅五比卅，滬警再停，何增替雄標，蓉生福海都是好手，卅八比卅六久全易摩西出，回力魏啓崑在打『强心針』，可是他們不能看牢，又被蓉生何增乘虛而入，分數又吿脫節。四九比四五志吉五次犯規離塲，再沒有後備軍，僅存永芳叔沅福海啓崑四個人打對方五個，最後的命運，已經判定，觀衆惟有寄以無限的同情和惋惜。七分鐘寡不敵衆的局面過去，滬警六八比六一勝回力。</p>

<p>〔本報特譯紐約訊〕麥迪遜廣塲花園中，正鷙烈的舉行室內運動會，燈光燦爛，音樂齊嗚，依次奏着　蘭·瑞典·美國三國國歌。一英里賽立刻就要開始，荷蘭的史列克　期，瑞典的貝格遜，都是世運會中的名將，這二曲國歌就是向他們致敬的。「華那曼克」英里賽從來沒有外人得勝過，今年美國英里名將社茲退休後，美國長距離繼起無人，此次參加伴賽的，祗有惠司康辛大學帶眼鏡的二十一歲靑年蓋爾曼。幾個星期之前，他曾經在麥迪遜試跑，創造了四分六秒一的驚人成績，僅差杜茲的室內紀錄十分之八秒。如果這紀錄沒有差，許多人都說他曾有叫人驚駭的創作。搶聲響後，蓋爾曼穿着紅馬甲一馬當先，在半英里的時候，話筒裏報吿着，他的成績是二分二秒。第二名是史列古司，緊追於後，貝格遜因爲牙痛，滿嘴含着配尼西林，精神不振，顯然落得很後不跑了。四分之三英里的路程時，荷蘭人已衝到了前面，時間已去三分〇八秒，蓋爾曼自忖，這成績他很自信在最後一衝可獲得勝利，他極有打破四分五秒三的把握。在最後三十四碼的直徑跑道上，果然見他脫穎而出，像短跑的衝來，以五碼的距離，壓倒史利克惠斯，成績四分九秒五。蓋氏說，今夜有點失常，沒有好成績。樂隊還沒有奏完，比利時國歡連着起來，世運五千米冠軍比名駱列夫，果然獲二英里賽冠軍，紀錄是八分五十六秒一，爲夫人拉愛斯之後的最佳成績。</p>

<h3>南遷聲中話南國</h3>
<p>— 思銘</p>
<p>三個月來的羊城，大非昔比，在這時局動　，政府南遷聲中，這裏冠蓋雲集，雖然只有短短的三個月，却已有顯著的差別了。</p>
<p>各地公務員和疏散來的「難民」，使這一個都市的人口，驟然劇增，於是幾條熱閙的馬路，老是擠得水洩不通，晚上各商店的霓虹燈，爭奇鬥妍，招攬顧客，在夜市蕭條的上海，也許是望塵莫及吧。這裏沒有宵禁，城開不夜，因為人口劇增，市面突形繁榮，原有的發電量更感供不應求，因此採取分區輪流停電辦法，然而，晚上却還是燈火煇熄，茶樓酒肆，戲院歌座，莫不利市三倍，濃粧　抹的女侍，笑靨　迎。</p>
<p>車少人多</p>
<p>「03」「04」的闊佬們，在滿舖沙塵的柏油路上，風馳電掣，再加上廣州的「16」，還不算少的汽車，點報着這都市的繁華面。市府刻正預備禁領新車牌照，以維交通，這裏沒有電車，只有些破舊不堪和設計簡陋的「長途車」，車少人多，因此像沙甸魚般拚命的擠，分全票和眾警票，事實上軍警們是老實不客氣，坐的「霸王車」，而一般市民却購的軍警票，只有少數的小姐太太們，旣不能為「軍警」，也不似「公敎」，只好破鈔了。你購票也好，不購票也好，只要昂昻首，抿抿嘴，售票的就不敢多問，也許這就是久經欺凌所養成的奴性吧。</p>
<p>不知有家</p>
<p>前些日子，記者因事去黃埔一次，踏上了車，却滿是些制服階級，照例是坐車不售票，沽票的嘰咕了幾聲，觸怒了他們的肝火，於是破口大駡，「他媽的，打了幾年的仗，流血流汗，落得家散人亡，隻身一個，只知有國不知有家，却連坐車也遭人白眼，是國家窮，不是我們不肯買票啊。」這一席話，聞之心酸。</p>
<p>黃埔一瞥黃埔，這一個南方大港，廣州的吐納地，戰後更顯示其重要性了。以前往來的船隻，可以直駛市區，經年的戰亂，珠江水淺了，於是外洋的旅客和貨物，只能在黃埔下卸，再以駁艇或汽車駛入市區，在這裏，陸軍的搖籃，北伐的發源地，黃埔軍官學校矗立着，時閒是無情的，雖然它的精神是永存不朽，但是它的驅壳—校址，却破舊了。最近南遷聲中，軍校復址，這泥濘的小集，熈熈攘攘，又別是一片天地。</p>
<p>生活高壓隨着孫院長的生活高壓蒞穗，市民的心情格外的沉重了，是不是府院分裂？會不會和談失敗？於是金元券貶值再貶值，物價狂漲又狂漲，造成空前的波動和混亂，一日數跳，老百姓就喘息在這高壓的生活鞭　之下，這裏就近香港，港幣就成了寵兒，金舖和賣「香烟」的攤販，如過江之鯽，專營這公開而又為當局禁止的外幣買賣。一切物價，多改用基數制，其實基數也者，就是變相的港幣底數，而跟着黑市喊價加上倍數兌拆金券，比較上海半月一次的生活指數，要機動得多，因此不再是一日數跳，而是時刻波動，連市政捐稅也將實行基數制了挺而走險華南的匪盜，素稱强悍，郊區治安，固無保障，接連幾次的廣九刦車，聞者色變，卽市區內之明搶暗竊，亦成尋常事件。僻靜的街巷，人夜後，行人多具戒心，物價無限制的上漲，失業人口衆多，無怪這年頭許多人挺而走險了。</p>
<p>吃的閒情這裏食館之多花色新奇，使你垂涎，值得一提的到是這裏有上海食不到的異味·狗肉·貓肉·蛇肉等，因為地近港澳，洋貨充斥，尤以閙區的攤販，糖果餅乾，繼頭食品，花花綠綠，五光十色，資本之大，是你所想像不到。茶樓一日三市，總是人頭擠擠，一個上海來的朋友問我，為什麽廣東人這樣的空閒？這是不是兩粵人的習性？我無以應對。</p>
<p>南國婦女如果一個時代的都市應該有些時髦的仕女點綴一下的話，那麽廣州是落伍了，旅穗三月，幾乎很少看到裝束入時的小姐。記得有人這樣的批評過，法國女人的韻，德國女人的健，美國女人的俏，英國女人的穩，日本女人的柔，而上海小姐却兼而有之，這句話雖未免有過份渲染的色彩，但畢竟也見得為人仰慕之深，我並不否認「南國佳人」這一句話，滬裏儘多着漂亮的姑娘，但是，如果以都市的眼光去衡度，她們的服飾是不够入時，然而，換一種心情去看的話，也許這正是我國人的淳樸吧。</p>
<h3>金華火腿　徐圖復興　力謀發展</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　蔣風</p>
<p>〔本報金華十四日訊〕提起金華，每一個人都會聯想起火腿來，的確，與雲南宣威齊名的金華火腿，香味之佳，遠非其他火腿所可比。　金華火腿，不僅金華一地有腿出產，凡金華舊府屬的東陽·蘭谿·浦江·義烏·永康·武義·湯溪等縣，均有火腿出產，統稱之為「金華火腿」。金華火腿之所以能名馳中外，製造得法，固為一原因，但金華猪隻品種異於尋常，實為其主要因素。金華猪種，皮薄骨細，四肢短小，皮下脂肪較少，而肌肉特別發達，肉纖維細嫩，體重不大，普通生長十個月，約重一百三十市斤左右，外形特點為背狹長，腰彎嘴尖，頸長，四肢細短，毛色頭尾多黑色，而四足及腰部為白色。</p>
<p>飼猪方法</p>
<p>金屬一般農家，多以飼猪為副業。飼養方法與一般相似，但食料較佳，通常母錯生產後第一日　以糯米粥，繼之豆漿，使其乳量充沛，迨小猪能食飼料，就飼以米飯，米湯或小麥粥，以後逐漸與以一成大麥·四成豆麥粉粥，至八九週後就可斷乳，單獨飼養。斷乳之後，飼於猪舍，廐內墊稻草麥桿，並隨時注意更換，以保持淸潔，乾燥。通常食料為人食餘之渣滓，洗米漿，野菜，和以大麥粉。到屠宰前二月，卽給與較佳美之食料，使之肥育，如飼以大麥粥，胡蘿蔔粥等，間亦混以豆腐糟·酒糟。在生長期內，禁止其出欄漫跑，並留心其衛生。</p>
<p>火腿的鹹製方法，普通一般人認為醃腿係用窰缸，每缸又須設置狗腿一隻，全缸火腿方能香味俱佳，其實此種方法僅僅是農家少量鹹製時為之，大規模之製腿並不如此。</p>
<p>腿屋腿床</p>
<p>現在，先談醃屋之選擇，與腿床之構造：建造腿屋之先决條件，厥為有光綫而不過分乾燥，且不甚通風之處，其他如防止蠅鼠之侵入，亦為重要條件，故多選擇於地潮之樓下屋，並揀樓柵方整之屋為之。樓橺上置排釘，以備掛腿之用。</p>
<p>腿床之構造，以木為之，一端之兩足略高，以適於鹽水之流出，架長八尺許，寬三尺許，上舖仰覆相間之半剖毛竹管，削除其節，使之光滑，腿床置醃屋內，視其規模大小，放置若干具。</p>
<p>再談選腿之標準，以重量言，戰前每擇二十左右之腿，近年來受購買力低落之影響，大隻火腿銷路不暢，故均選擇十斤至十二經左右之鮮腿。以質量言，擇白毛白趾，瘦肉厚肥肉層薄，肢細小，皮薄而健壯者為上選。</p>
<p>醃製過程</p>
<p>選腿工作完畢後，卽開始醃製，今分述其過程於後：</p>
<p>（一）整腿：用刀修削腿肉，使之外觀美好，去鮮腿上之油脂膜，擦去腿淤血。</p>
<p>（二）椒鹽：在腿心撒鹽一指厚，其他各處可略薄，皮面亦擦鹽少數，以後在翻腿時，每次均須撒鹽，惟量可稍减，至末次亦有不撒鹽者。據估計：一斤鮮腿，約需鹽一兩至一兩半。</p>
<p>（三）　腿；首次撒鹽之後，卽開始疊腿工作，先將腿仰置於腿床中，待排滿一層後，腿上架竹　二根，此蔑應架於尾脊骨上，依此法可疊緊十層，技術優良者可疊至十五層。</p>
<p>（四）糊腿：　腿後三日，卽行首次翻腿，先將腿逐隻　於空床上，撒鹽若干，將腿翻置空床上，與疊腿同法，通常翻腿三次，約每隔四日行之，惟依俗例，一遇實雨，卽須　腿，以防腐爛。在正常狀態下，自首次撒鹽至末次翻腿，需時十二至十五日，以後再疊置半月，卽可行洗腿工作。</p>
<p>（五）洗腿：將腿浸人水中七八小時，令其腐質及鹽分逐漸溶化，然後淨潔之。</p>
<p>（六）製腿：以雙手捺壓腿後之二旁，候外形呈飽滿狀始止，繼以鎚擊膝蓋，又將腿爪挿入橙孔內，此孔預先繫好，使爪尖呈曲形，嗣以刀刮去外皮汚油，然後印上商標。</p>
<p>（七）晒腿：俟商標印就，卽將腿仰晒蔑墊上，俟稍乾，在腿爪繫以繩索，懸上木架曝晒，晒至腿皮發紅，透油為止。</p>
<p>（八）修腿：在出售之先，尙須修腿一次，使呈平整光滑。</p>
<p>金腿稱類</p>
<p>製成後之火腿，約可分為下列種類：</p>
<p>（一）雪舫：小雪至大雪期間所醃者，品質化良，為火腿中之上品</p>
<p>（二）直冬：隆冬時所醃者，又名「眞冬」。</p>
<p>（三）醬腿：在末次撒鹽時，外敷豆醬一層，至洗腿時刷去，外觀雖遜，但味香却較一般過之，此種產量不多，且多用作自食。</p>
<p>（四）月腿：常以前腿削去肢骨，而外形如一團月，故名。</p>
<p>（五）竹葉燻腿：將鮮腿懸於灶頭，經烟薰月餘而成。多不撒鹽，味甘而淡。</p>
<p>（六）深山野味：野猪腿製成，經部常留黑毛以為表識，味鮮異。</p>
<p>（七）戌腿：以狗腿製成，味亦甚美，多為繁用。</p>
<p>（八）風肉：以前麗醃製，而不削成團月形者，肉較厚，味較遜。</p>
<p>製腿，為舊金華府屬各縣農村之副業。近數十年來，因求過於供，已　向集中製造，成為作坊形態。再一作坊聘用一技師，每年可　製火腿千餘隻。若除技師外，加雇一助力，則可製醃三千隻左右。技師薪給至為優厚，每月薪給食米五·六担，亦有高至千斤以上者。普通中層以上之農家，亦仍多以副業方式生產之，每年冬季　腿若干隻，而由農民繼承祖法親手醃製，不另覆人操作。</p>
<p>所產總量</p>
<p>在殲前，金展各縣火腿之總產量，約在八十萬隻以上，其中以東陽產量為最多，估計年產量約達三十萬隻。其次為蘭谿，年產量二十萬隻，義烏金華居三，年產量各約十五萬隻上下。永康·浦江，各約三四萬隻。武義湯溪合計亦年產萬隻以上。各縣年產量不一，全視市塲供需情形而定。上項火腿，除部分腿商逕運滬杭轉銷外，其餘多在金華集散。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，受原料·資力，銷路種種原因，金華火腿之生產，一度銳退至幾無出產。尤其當三十一年，浙贛事變之後，產區全部淪陷於日人之手，敵人常四出擄掠，幾民不願養猪，原料成了問題，加以產業無保障，外銷絕望，因此金華火腿幾乎絕跡。</p>
<p>去年產量</p>
<p>勝利以後，火腿生產原可望迅速恢復，惟以金屬各縣陷敵三年，農村元氣未復，火腿產臺仍無起色，僅及戰前三分之一。去年似漸趨復甦，有欣欣向榮之象，但與戰前相較，仍遠落其後。據熟識內情者言：去年產量，仍以東陽居首，約在十五萬隻左右。金華　登次位，亦僅十萬隻上下。蘭谿義烏各約六七萬隻，永康三萬隻，浦江·武義約二萬隻，約數亦僅四十餘萬隻，合戰前二分之一强。</p>
<p>復興道路</p>
<p>金華火腿，雖已徐圖復興，重振旗鼓，但以農村經濟衰竭，腿業資金枯竭，產量仍無法回復戰前之水準，似乎欲興乏力。惟火腿突為浙東珍貴特產之一，應有其發展之前途。記者在報導之餘，潔感金萬腿業之亟待振興，期望政府，宜注意下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）在金華設立猪種繁殖塲，繁殖優良之猪種，以增加原料之來源。</p>
<p>（二）獎勵農民普遍養猪。</p>
<p>（三）樹立商品檢騐制度，劃一產區之品質，以爭取海外市塲，以裕農村經濟。</p>
<p>（四）指導農民改等火腿產製技術。</p>

<h3>湘桂黔鐵路動力庫　合山煤礦面臨難關</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　梁雨山</p>
<p>〔本報桂林十四日航訊〕由於局勢的影響，綰轂西南的湘桂黔鐵路的任務一天加重一天了，而亟需解決的問題也更加迫切。今日鐵道的動力問題，顯然比什麽都緊要，目前該路行車用煤，月需一萬三千噸以上，來源以合山，祁陽，大蒲等地為主，而煤質除合山一地所產尙可用外其餘產品甚劣，含砂土半數，過去黔桂鐵路行軍非用合山煤不能爬六甲以上的高坡。</p>
<p>合山煤礦在桂省遷江縣境內，有合山，河里兩礦塲，而河里所產品質不純，不能作機器燃料。合山礦塲棵掘十餘年，已有枯竭之勢，由日產一百三十噸降至日產七十餘噸。去年五月，合山煤礦公司在離原礦塲東八里的牛攔發現東礦煤田，藏量約五十餘萬公噸，以日產煤百五十噸計，卽可開採十年。這新動力被發現後，礦方卽動工開採，但因財力有限，採礦工程僅開了平巷八道，每日出煤不過三十噸，距原定計劃相差尙遠，而產品產出後，輸運問題亦與之俱來，要煤斤能源源運出，必須在今年雨季前築成五公里長的輕便鐵路支綫，僅僅這一項工程，就够使礦方為難。三十五磅軌五公里的輕便鐵道，有十餘萬土石方，大小涵洞二十多個，除材料外，單工資一項，卽需米二百餘萬斤。輕軌能如期築成的話，礦塲鐵路將近二千名的產運員工，也天天要吃飯，在此生產極度困難，煤價追不上物價的時候，要應付偌大的塲面，實在不是易事。目前，礦方正面臨此重重難關，興築便道的費用無法籌借，煤礦生產因此窒息，湘桂黔鐵路的動力燃料也將因之阻斷，現礦方正在大聲疾呼，籲请政府協助。</p>
<p>桂林省市政圏　一場風波</p>
<p>〔本報桂林十一一日訊〕平靜已久的省市政圈最近　起了小風波，日前桂林市參議會，與市銀行，警察局閙意見，在團結擊中不能不說是一件憾事。本月七日，市參會開一屆十二次常會，前二一日是聽取市府施政報告，十日邀請市銀行與警察局出席大會備諮詢，當時兩單拉均拒絕蒞會，引起全體參議員不滿，推派議長議員共六人，聯名控到省府及省保部，同時延會聽命。</p>
<p>警察局的見解狠單純，而且事後態度緩和，所提理由是：警局係屬省級機關，向無出席縣市會議報吿之先例，對於市治安如有諮詢必要，請隨時來函詢問，最後表示願候省府及省保部核示。</p>
<p>市銀行態度强硬，與參會各走極端，提出狠多拒絕到會的理由，說市銀行是官商合辦之特種股份有限公司，一切行務之進行，依章經一理向股東會或董事會負責，參會欲查詢該行業務需過行洽談，該行經理陳壽筠更堅決表示絕對不接納參會意見，甚至上級機關指示，他說：「市長是市行董事長·議長是常務監察，銀行代理市庫及其他業務議畏可直接到行查詢，並不是對參會歧視，而是無出席報吿之必要」。他最後重又申說，如果參會一定要和他為難，最多不過一走了事。參會方面目前仍繼續延會，此一僵局看來尙待黃主席為之解決。</p>

<h3>Xu Kan Goes to the Capital for Final Instructions; New Economic Plan to be Announced; Free Trade of Gold and Silver to Enhance Currency Credibility</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Finance Minister Xu Kan was still in Shanghai yesterday dealing with important matters. The work of seeking minor opinions before the implementation of the new economic plan has come to an end. Mr. Xu went to the capital last night or at the latest this morning to meet with Acting President Li and provide final instructions on the matter. According to sources close to Mr. Xu, the existence of the new plan is no longer a question, and the free and open trading of gold and silver will indeed help enhance currency credibility, at least in the short term. Yesterday afternoon, the city's financial market clearly felt the impact of this new plan. Financial commodities fell by about 20% within 20 minutes in the afternoon due to the transmission of certain confirmed information. As for when the measures will be officially announced, there is much speculation from the outside world. According to the plan, Mr. Xu must also go to Guangzhou to submit the new plan to the Political Affairs Conference on the 19th for approval. The most likely time for the announcement should be early next week.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou Dispatch, 17th] According to reliable sources, the authorities are determined to reform financial and economic policies, will use all their strength to stabilize currency values, and absorb idle capital in order to establish gold yuan credit, thereby cracking down on local currency system reform plans being carried out in various places. As for the content of the new reform plan, it will be announced as soon as Minister Xu returns to Guangzhou. The Ministry of Finance spokesperson also denied the rumor that silver coins would be issued, saying that there are currently no signs to prove that silver coins may be adopted. In addition, the business community here has requested the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to abolish the overly strict export control system for several days. Recently, the person in charge of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that the Ministry has consulted with the Ministry of Finance to effectively improve the measures. It is also learned that after the new policy is implemented, all past measures such as export foreign exchange settlement and foreign exchange transfer will be abolished.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou Dispatch, 17th] The Guangdong Provincial Assembly Standing Committee once passed a proposal by Ou Yi-ming and others, requesting the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters to restrict the entry of gold yuan notes into Guangdong and prohibit the circulation of Hong Kong dollars in order to stabilize finance and stabilize prices, based on previous methods. The Assembly sent a telegram to the Pacification Headquarters, requesting its execution. The Pacification Headquarters currently believes that the number of gold yuan notes carried by passengers into Guangdong should be executed in accordance with the proposal. In addition, the Guangzhou Financial Management Bureau and the Guangdong Customs have been strictly ordered to strictly enforce the ban on the free flow and sale of Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<h3>Proposed Solutions to the Requirements of the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The eight requirements submitted by the Silver, Money, and Trust Industry Association to Finance Minister Xu Kan the week before last, it is heard that the National Bank and the Financial Management Bureau have formulated solutions based on the actual situation, and they can be implemented immediately after being approved by the Ministry of Finance. The key points of the requirements put forward by the silver and money industry are as follows: (1) The balance of cashier's checks should be exempt from being sent to the National Bank, and the banks should be responsible for them themselves. (2) The daily exchange balance should be transferred to the joint reserve car. The authorities believe that there is no problem in principle with the above two points, but they are worthy of research technically. They will not be implemented before Zhu Nanchang of the National Bank leaves, and are not currently considered. (3) Please return the foreign exchange portion of the declared foreign exchange assets. Due to environmental reasons, there is no possibility of implementation for the time being. (4) The valuation of US dollar public bonds in the deposit reserve. In principle, the authorities have agreed to modify it, changing the original exchange rate of 20 to 1. The new ratio will be determined after discussion. (5) Regarding the interest on deposit reserves, it has been increased from 12% to 15%. (6) The association can adjust the interest rates on bank deposits and loans at any time according to market conditions. (7) The capital verification procedures after the bank's capital increase are currently being expedited and can be completed this month. (8) The use of the cash portion of the bank's capital increase has been carried out in batches in accordance with the original plan.</p>
<h3>The Government Proposes a Three-Year Aid-to-China Plan to the United States; Rumor Says $600 Million Loan Has Been Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou Dispatch, 17th] According to reliable sources, the US$600 million loan to China from the United States has been approved by the US, and it is said that both parties have signed a contract, but officials have not confirmed it.</p>
<p>[United Press Guangzhou Dispatch, 17th] Executive Yuan President Sun Ke told a reporter from this agency yesterday that he does not believe that President Chiang will make a comeback. When the reporter asked whether Mr. Sun thought that Mr. Chiang would actively lead the government again, Mr. Sun solemnly replied: "No, Mr. Chiang intends to retire for a long time." Mr. Sun met with reporters at his new official residence in Chengnan. It was the first time Mr. Sun had hosted foreign reporters since the government moved south. Mr. Sun denied that he had disagreements with Acting President Li, saying that the actions of the cabinet moving south were completely consistent with Acting President Li. It is expected that other major administrative agencies remaining in Beijing will move to Guangdong with the cabinet, and Acting President Li will also visit Guangdong, but the exact date has not been determined. The personnel of the President's Office and a portion of the files have already been transported here. Acting President Li's preparation to come to Guangdong proves that the cabinet's move to Guangzhou was not a decision made solely by the cabinet, but was made after the entire government consulted with Acting President Li and obtained his consent. Meetings of the Legislative Yuan should not be held in Shanghai or Nanjing, but should be held in Guangzhou. Holding meetings in Guangdong can guarantee that they will not be interfered with by the Communist Party. About 120 members of the Legislative Yuan from Taiwan have expressed their willingness to hold meetings in Guangzhou with 100 members of the Legislative Yuan from the southwestern provinces. About 60 members of the Legislative Yuan from Guangdong advocate holding a vote in Guangzhou to decide where to hold meetings. This proposal has a democratic style. Mr. Sun did not pay attention to the fact that the Control Yuan resumed its meeting in Nanjing yesterday, saying only that a plenary meeting will be held in March. Mr. Sun emphasized that Guangzhou is suitable as the capital, smiling and saying, "Once Nanjing becomes too hot and uninhabitable, I believe ambassadors from various countries will also come to Guangzhou." When talking about the issue of peace talks, Mr. Sun said that the cabinet has not thoroughly discussed or decided on the terms of peace talks, and there has been no news since the Shanghai peace delegation went to Beiping. I absolutely believe that Acting President Li will never accept any peace terms that are tantamount to surrender. The Chinese Communist Party opposes mediation by United Nations agencies. I don’t know the reason, but it is also a good thing if direct negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can achieve a fair and honorable peace. Mr. Sun denied rumors that he had resigned, believing that they were speculation by some reporters in Shanghai, but in fact there was no such thing. Mr. Sun revealed that the government had submitted two plans to the Economic Cooperation Administration, requesting continued assistance after the current aid-to-China plan expires on April 3 this year. This was proposed by former Executive Yuan President Weng Wenhao when ECA Director Paul G. Hoffman came to China in December last year. One of them requested an allocation of US$80 million as a temporary advance payment from April 3 to the end of the fiscal year in late June. The other requested the United States to implement a three-year aid-to-China plan, from July 1949 to June 1952, with a total cost of 3 billion yuan, similar in nature to the aid-to-Europe plan. The Economic Cooperation Administration's US$70 million aid-to-China construction plan had been suspended, but the construction funds for the railways in Taiwan and South China will be restored. I recently raised this issue in person when ECA branch director Lapham visited Guangdong. I also requested the ECA to allocate US$3.5 million to complete the Huangpu Port project. The cabinet allocated the same amount of funds at the meeting yesterday morning to improve the port so that it can accommodate 10,000-ton ships. The entire project can be completed within one year.</p>

In addition, 4,000 Communist troops from the Yangtze River Column suddenly arrived in Jingjiang City from Huangqiao on the 15th.

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Yangtze River Column of the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu is currently actively building Jiang defense works in the section along the river from Nantong to Langshan Junshan. At the same time, the port facilities of Tiangshenggang, Lujinggang, and Rengang have been completely destroyed in order to prevent landings.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Dispatch, 17th] Two units of the Communist Army's New Sixth Regiment and the Xinghua Independent Regiment, totaling about 2,000 people, attacked the Shijiaqiao National Army position north of Liuyu at 10:00 last night.

The National Army is still strengthening its alert, and the Air Force is constantly flying over the north bank of the Yangtze River for reconnaissance.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiangyin Dispatch, 16th] The Jingjiang Communist Army Independent Regiment and others once engaged in outpost battles with the National Army at Bazhougang and Shizhouqiao, but soon retreated north.

As for the Jinpu Front East-West Ge area, it was still quiet and there were no battles on the 16th and 17th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Communist Army, which is lined up on the north bank of the Yangtze River like giant herons with outstretched wings, has not yet exerted pressure on the National Army's bridgehead still on the north bank. According to military sources here on the 17th, this fact indicates that the Communist Army has no intention of forcibly crossing the Yangtze River in the near future. These people believe that the Communist Army's crossing offensive will take the form of a concentrated attack, most likely in Wuhu, because the Communist Army may establish an attack line straight to Hangzhou here to cut off the retreat of the National Army in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. They said: The Communist Army's consistent strategy is not to capture cities as the main goal, but to annihilate the main force of the National Army on the battlefield. If the Communist Army directly attacks Nanjing and Shanghai from the front without cutting off the retreat, the National Army will be able to retreat south when necessary. On the other hand, the reduction of the Communist Army's pressure may be considered as the Communist Party's understanding that crossing the river will require a large sacrifice of manpower, and peace talks may avoid this sacrifice. If the peace talks are successful, the Communist Party can cross the Yangtze River without spending a single soldier.</p>
<p>Military sources said that there are currently no signs of the Communist Army under Lin Biao moving south from the Pingjin area, but when the final crossing offensive must begin, it is very possible for Lin Biao's troops to move south. As for the Communist Army under Chen Yi, it is currently gathering in Huaian, Tianchang, Chuxian, Chaoxian and other places for reorganization.</p>

<p>[Associated Press San Francisco Dispatch, 17th] The CCP radio station broadcast on the 17th that the various developments in the past month show that the peace measures announced by Acting President Li on the 22nd of last month were of no value because Mr. Li's orders are not being followed. The broadcast said that since Mr. Li announced that the government intended to "eliminate all obstacles to peace," some of the measures he announced have been cancelled by the Executive Yuan. The broadcast referred to the order to release Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng as a "farce," as the order was not followed, and Mr. Li's personal representative was unable to carry it out after going to Taiwan.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Maintain Traffic and Stabilize Society!</h3>
<p>Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou are located south of the Yangtze River, where transportation has always been convenient. Until now, they are still separated from the war zone by the Yangtze River. However, the transportation situation has fallen into chaos in the past two months and is trending downward. As a result, public transportation in Shanghai is often suspended due to various reasons. Especially in the past two weeks, the situation has worsened, and the chaos in traffic order has reached an extreme. On the first day of this month, the French tram once stopped running, and the dispatching offices of two tram lines were destroyed. On the second day, the French tram's workshop was destroyed. On the third day, French tram drivers and ticket sellers clashed with soldiers, resulting in a strike to protest. On the eighth day, workers of the two tram lines surrounded the management bureau to demand better treatment, and all trains were completely suspended. On the same day, public bus employees went on a slowdown due to wage issues. On the ninth day, the labor unrest on the two tram lines resurfaced, and the vehicles on both lines were suspended again. On the 15th and 16th, the labor unrest on the two tram lines expanded, with 6,000 workers collectively petitioning, and the vehicles on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines were suspended all day. On the same day, public bus employees in the city went on strike again because their request for emergency funds was not met. In addition, incidents such as petitioning groups obstructing traffic, or passengers rushing and squeezing onto vehicles, resulting in falls, injuries, and deaths, are common occurrences, truly making people lament the difficulty of moving even a step.</p>
<p>Such a situation would be understandable if it occurred on the day when enemy troops were at the city walls. It would also not be surprising if it occurred in a remote area with traffic congestion. But at this time and place, with the communist army stationed north of the Yangtze River and showing no signs of crossing it, and with the river defenses as solid as a rock, south of the Yangtze River is as stable as a mountain. The people certainly do not need to rush and seize transportation, and the regulatory agencies should calmly dispatch and maintain order. Even if there is a military need, extra trains should be added in sequence. As for the general employees of transportation agencies, although their treatment is meager, it should not be worse than that of ordinary public school teachers and government employees. Even if skyrocketing prices make it impossible to make a living, they should legally apply for adjustments and improvements. These are problems that should be directly negotiated between employees and supervisors, and are internal affairs of the transportation agencies. However, the responsible authorities could not prevent problems from occurring, nor could they properly handle and resolve disputes when they did occur, ultimately causing the labor unrest to drag on and expand repeatedly. The employees, on the other hand, did not consider the overall situation and resorted to slowdowns, strikes, petitions, and encirclements as means of coercion. This resulted in vehicles being suspended several times a day, and public transportation coming to a standstill. What is even more strange is that there are clear announcements prohibiting strikes and concentrated coercion, but they are treated as waste paper. Such disarray and chaos, such shouting and clamoring, what kind of system is this, what kind of society is this! At the same time, news is coming from Tianjin that railway transportation centered on Beiping seems to be gradually recovering. Regardless of how the Communist Party handles these issues, its administrative efficiency exceeds that of our government, which even people in the government cannot deny.</p>
<p>Although the unrest on the two tram lines was largely resolved yesterday, the factors of social unrest still exist, and such unrest is likely to continue to arise here and there. Looking at our country, which is on the verge of storms and turmoil, on the brink of collapse, it is also at a critical juncture for revival. The central government is sincerely seeking peace and striving to reform politics. All agencies, organizations, employees, and people throughout the country should share the burden, work together, overcome the current difficulties, and move forward towards the future of reforming politics and improving the economy. In particular, maintaining public transportation and stabilizing social order is the responsibility of everyone.</p>
<p>The quality of social atmosphere is originally tied to the morale of the people. If the entire society is filled with violence, selfishness, contention, and rascality, resulting in shouting, fighting, and destruction, and all that is seen everywhere is chaos, and the authorities are only greedy and incompetent, then where have the human virtues of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame gone? And what is the point of the state establishing official positions and assigning duties, and the local authorities issuing proclamations of martial law? As for national consciousness and social concepts, there is even less to talk about!</p>
<p>We fervently hope that Acting President Li will rectify official misconduct and military discipline, and achieve the goal of reforming politics. We also hope that reforming politics will not forget to improve the economy, stabilize currency value, curb price increases, and improve the salaries and benefits of public school teachers, government employees, and general wage earners. In particular, maintaining public transportation and stabilizing social order are matters of utmost urgency. In this regard, we also hope that all compatriots throughout the country will repeatedly reflect on Guanzi's words on the four pillars of the state, and cooperate with political reform and economic improvement to jointly transform the social atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Has Not Stopped Military Actions; Scattered Battles in Various Regions; Ministry of National Defense Announces Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th Dispatch] The Ministry of National Defense recently announced the weekly war situation from the 10th to the 16th as follows:</p>
<p>In the past week, the government has continued to sincerely seek peace, but the Communist Party has not stopped its military actions. Here is a summary of the scattered battles in various regions: On the Yangtze River front, the Communist forces of Chen Yi's unit north of the Yangtze River have been moving south along the entire line since the 13th (the day after the Lantern Festival). They are currently gathering in Gaoyou, Tianchang, Mingguang, Chaoxian, Hefei, and other places. There are currently no main Communist forces in the area north of Bengbu and Huaiyin, and the situation in the Liangpu area has not changed significantly. A small number of Communist troops are appearing near Wuyi. The 6th and 7th Columns of Chen Yi's unit are currently being reorganized and replenished near Hefei. In the areas of Chaoxian and Hexian, the number of Communist troops has also been increasing in recent days, and their activities are more active than before. All ships, horses, fuel, food, and young men in the vicinity have been requisitioned. It appears that the Communist forces in that area are actively replenishing new recruits and collecting food, preparing to cross the river. As for the small number of local Communists near Caishi, they have been cleared by the National Army. In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, a unit of the National Army launched a continuous counterattack against Tianshengang, Nantong, starting on the 10th, inflicting considerable damage on the Communist forces. Now that the mission has been accomplished, they have safely returned to their original defenses. The situation in the requisition has stabilized, and the Communist forces have withdrawn 15 li. Order in the area has returned to normal. Around the Jiangyin Fortress, our army and navy are strictly defending. Rumors that small groups of Communist troops had secretly crossed the river are absolutely untrue.</p>
<p>In Central China, the Communist forces of Chen Geng's unit on the Han-Ying Line are still in the Tanghe area, without major changes. There is no Communist activity around Xinyang, Queshan, and Zhumadian. A unit of Communist forces circled southwards the week before. The 10th Column, Jianghan Column, and New 1st Brigade, commanded by Li Xiannian, infiltrated Jingmen after invading it, and then infiltrated near Shilipu and Tuanlinpu. The National Army recovered Jingmen at 10:00 AM on the 16th. The Communist troops originally based in Jingmen fled eastward. In order to ensure the safety of the periphery of Yichang and Shashi, our army is dividing its forces to attack Li Renlin's unit of Communist troops in the area southeast of Xionggou and Zheluhe. In addition, the National Army in Anlu, Yingcheng, Jiangling, and other places is also launching clearing operations in the surrounding areas to block the Communist forces' local offensives and protect the safety of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. In other areas, there were no major battles in Taiyuan and northern Shaanxi this week. The government has made its utmost efforts to seek overall peace. Whether or not a peaceful ceasefire can be achieved now faces the final test of whether the Communist Party is sincere about peace.</p>
<h3>NT Dollar Exchange Rate Changed to 18</h3>

<h3>Many County Magistrates in Ganzhou Corrupt; Almost 80 Percent</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang, 17th Dispatch] According to statistics from the Department of Civil Affairs, corruption cases among county magistrates in Ganzhou account for almost 80 percent. Since January of this year, 64 out of 83 county magistrates have been accused of corruption.

The High Court has telegraphed the Ministry for instructions regarding the request for release of the traitor Zhou Guanhong.</p>
<h3>Xie Nanguang Speaks on the Current Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>Believes It Is Extremely Easy to Restore Armaments</p>
<p>[Our Taipei, 17th Dispatch] Xie Nanguang, a member of our delegation to Japan, was invited by the Information Office today to speak to the press about the current situation in Japan. Xie said: The Allied Forces have controlled Japan for more than three years, and the armaments of the army, navy, and air force seem to have been dismantled on the surface. In fact, however, various military facilities have only been expanded. Taking the air force airfield as an example, Tokyo now has an airfield that can accommodate 500 B-17 Flying Fortresses. The crackdown on financial cliques is also incomplete. Therefore, it is extremely easy for Japan to restore its armaments. To prevent its aggression from rekindling, our country must insist on veto power when signing the peace treaty. Xie also mentioned that the Allied Forces' control has succeeded in two areas: first, the Emperor's system exists in name only; second, land reform has been quite effective.</p>

<h3>Some Huainan Coal Mine Workers Transferred to Jiangxi for Work</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang, 17th Dispatch] After the Huainan Coal Mine fell under the control of the Communist Party, the supply of Jiangnan coal has become increasingly difficult. The mine's remaining 150,000 tons of coal and all equipment have not been evacuated. It is now planned to transfer some of the miners, about 150 people, to Leping to participate in the Jiangnan Coal Mine work. Production will be increased through competition, and the highest daily output may reach 200 tons in the future. Mining expert Wang Dezi has arrived in the province and will go to Leping to plan increased production. Also, due to the Lunar New Year, many miners in the Jiangxi Coal Mine have returned to their hometowns, and production has generally decreased, with a current daily output of 100 tons. The coal used along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway mostly relies on Pingxiang coal supply, which is also feeling inadequate. In the future, if the Zhangshu Muqiao cannot run, the use of ferries will make the coal supply problem in Jiangxi more serious. The Provincial Department of Construction has decided to strengthen the production of the Tianhe and Beicheng Mines to cope with the industrial coal use in Jiangxi.</p>

<h3>One Week Visit to Southern Henan: People South of Zhumadian Can Freely Discuss Peace Issues</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xinyang, 16th of the Month] The reporter's summary of the situation on various fronts in southern Henan over the past week is as follows: (1) The seven columns of the Communist army—the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 9th, 10th, and 11th—that remain stranded on both sides of the Shahe River in southern Henan and on the northern, eastern, and western sides of Zhumadian are still actively replenishing their forces. In Luohe, 56 kilometers from Zhumadian, there are also over 10,000 newly organized troops from the Nationalist 10th Army. The Communist 1st and 3rd Columns on the eastern side of the Pinghan Railway are encircling the two divisions of Huang Wei's army corps, which were forced to surrender during the Xubeng Campaign but have not yet handed over their weapons, with a watchful attitude, slowly attempting to absorb them. It seems difficult for them to withdraw and advance southward in the short term. As for the two columns that have already advanced to the southwestern area of Wuyang, reconnaissance reports from aircraft indicate that a portion of them had crossed the Tang River on the 15th and fled toward Wuxiangfan, seemingly to coordinate with Communist forces operating on the periphery of Shayi. (2) Zhengyang has turned from danger to safety. Although the 7th Regiment of the 4th Security Brigade, which guards the south gate of the city, has suffered casualties, the 1st Security Brigade and the Communist White Horse and Black Horse Cavalry Regiments suffered very little loss in the 48-hour battle of attack and defense. This shows that the morale of the National Army on the front lines has improved compared to before. Furthermore, in Minggang, 90 li from Zhengyang, the entire town came out to welcome the reporter group on the 15th. Among the welcoming crowd at the station, there were even elders with long beards reaching their chests standing solemnly on the platform, setting off firecrackers to express their welcome. The reporters were deeply ashamed, as the 5th Bao of the town had over ten villages destroyed and over 300 civilians killed or injured by unruly local militias at the beginning of the first month of the lunar calendar. They had grievances but no one to tell. Now that Zhang Tu's army corps, which claims to be the army of the common people, has arrived, they can pour out their grievances to the Shanghai-Hankou reporters about the excellent results of military-civilian cooperation, which is very gratifying. (3) According to merchants from the north: the people south of Zhumadian can freely discuss the issue of peace negotiations, but the opposite is true north of Luohe.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xiaogan, 16th of the Month] After a 600-li visit to the war zone in southern Henan with colleagues from Wuhan, our reporter returned to Xiaogan from Xinyang at 4:00 PM on the 16th to meet with the military and political authorities of the 6th Security District and plans to travel to Changjiangbu, the economic heart of central China, and Yingcheng, the outpost of Wuhan, within the next few days to interview the local military and civilians.</p>

<h3>Building a Large-Scale Air Defense Network from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean: The US Prepares to Supply Britain with a Large Number of Flying Fortresses</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th of the Month] The countries of the Western European Union are currently establishing a large-scale radar air defense network, from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south. This can be seen in the British government's defense white paper released yesterday. It is said that Britain has provided ground radar equipment to France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to complete a unified air defense network. According to official sources, a radar air defense headquarters will soon be established, under whose command will be all air defense stations from Lübeck, a Baltic port in the British-occupied zone of Germany, to the French Mediterranean coast. The radar air defense stations in the British-occupied zone of Germany will also be incorporated into this air defense network.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 16th of the Month] The Western European Union is stepping up the construction of a radar wall to defend against any unexpected air raids. The British government's white paper hints that an electronic "Eastern Wall" is being built. British sources say that concealed radar stations will be set up along the borders of the five countries and very closely spaced to form an invisible net capable of detecting even small rockets and enemy aircraft. If any suspicious aerial activity is detected, headquarters will immediately order each station to track the suspicious aircraft while simultaneously ordering fighters and anti-aircraft guns to prepare for combat. This system can double the effectiveness of the air defense network that inflicted heavy damage on German aircraft during the war.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th of the Month] The "Daily Telegraph" reported today that the British and American governments are currently negotiating the transfer of 150 American B-29 Flying Fortresses to the Royal Air Force.

<h3>Atlantic Pact Negotiations Underway: The US Reiterates Policies and Objectives: No Disagreement Between Government and Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th of the Month] Secretary of State Acheson firmly stated today that the US attitude toward the North Atlantic Pact has not changed. Acheson did not specify what specific obligations the US will undertake in the pact, only stating that it is still under negotiation.</p>
<p>Acheson repeatedly mentioned the US objectives and policies for the pact, saying that on this point, there is no disagreement between the State Department and Senators Connally and Vandenberg, the bipartisan foreign policy leaders in the Senate. We are conducting negotiations with the relevant countries in accordance with a clearly defined policy. This policy was recently revealed by President Truman in his inaugural address and was initially seen in the resolutions passed by both houses of Congress last June. This is the so-called Vandenberg Resolution, "In principle, the United States, in accordance with constitutional procedures, participates in regional and other collective measures, provided that such measures are based on continuous and effective self-help and mutual assistance and are related to the security of the United States." The resolution also stated that these measures should be in accordance with the purposes, principles, and provisions of the United Nations Charter for self-defense.</p>
<p>Validity Period of 20 Years</p>
<p>As for the duration of the pact, the countries have not yet reached an agreement and are still discussing it together. European countries generally advocate a term of fifty years, while the State Department believes that it should not exceed twenty years, but can be renewed upon expiration.</p>
<p>Security Guarantee Clause</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th of the Month] Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, advocated that the security guarantee clause in the North Atlantic Security Treaty should be stipulated as follows: "If one of the signatory countries encounters an armed attack, the other relevant countries, in order to exercise the right of collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, may individually or jointly take necessary measures to maintain the security of the North Atlantic region." It has not yet been determined whether the State Department is satisfied with the wording of this provision. Acheson recently said, "Our greatest contribution, together with the relevant countries, to maintaining peace is to declare in advance that any country that launches an armed attack on our security will be met with overwhelming force."</p>

The organization's Director-General, Canadian representative Chisholm, refused to accept the three countries' withdrawal requests and is willing to go to Moscow to answer the Soviet Union's accusations. He also said that the health organization's work plan for 1950 will definitely satisfy the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Americans Raise Funds to Aid Chinese Students</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 17th of the Month] Many residents of Mount Vernon have formed a committee to raise funds to provide housing for about 2,500 Chinese students here. This move was initiated by Mrs. Struthers, Chairman of the China Relief Association of the city. She said that she intends to plan welfare for Chinese students who have been affected by the Chinese civil war and have almost no money.</p>
<h3>Despite Opposition from Three Countries, the Soviet Union Insists on Reparation Demands from Austria, In Behind-the-Scenes Talks, Yugoslavia Expresses Concessions to Austria</h3>
<p>[Report] London, Broadcast on the 17th: Despite opposition from Western countries, the Soviet Union has renewed its demand for $150 million in reparations from Austria. Soviet representative Tsarapkin insisted at the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Representative Meeting that the reparations must be paid in US dollars, rejecting the US suggestion to pay part of the reparations in goods. At the same time, according to behind-the-scenes talks, Yugoslavia is prepared to reduce its demands for land and reparations from Austria. In the past few days, US representative Reber has held behind-the-scenes talks with Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Bebler and Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber, and it is rumored that he has obtained concessions from Bebler. It is said that Bebler stated that if the Slavic minorities in Austria can be protected, he can make significant reductions in land demands. It is said that Gruber suddenly flew back to Vienna on the 16th to consult with his government on how to respond to Austria's possible concessions to Yugoslavia.</p>
<h3>Royall Did Announce in Tokyo That the US Was Considering Withdrawing from Japan, He Doubted Japan's Value in a War Against the Soviet Union, Royall Denied It Again in Washington</h3>
<p>[United Press Reporter Kristoff, Tokyo, 17th of the Month] Secretary of the Army Royall's straightforward denial that he had told American reporters here that the United States would withdraw US troops stationed in Japan in a war against the Soviet Union, and his statement that he had never authorized the release of this information without disclosing his name, are inconsistent with his talk to twelve American reporters at the American Embassy here on February 6. The reporter is one of these twelve people, and although there is no record of the entire meeting at hand, the key points extracted by the reporter and other reporters confirm that the information we released is not incorrect. Regarding the possible withdrawal from Japan, Royall said: "The headquarters is now reconsidering Japan's military value. I have deep doubts about Japan's value in a war against the Soviet Union. I think it may be better to withdraw from Japan before the war starts, but no decision has been made yet. Any announcement regarding this suggestion is not yet ripe. This matter may be announced in January or mid-February, but I cannot be sure. I am not sure whether we can retain Japan. Similarly, while we possess the Ryukyu and the Philippines, I am not sure whether it is worthwhile to retain Japan. The Ryukyu and the Philippines are safer than Japan. In these two places, we can conduct strategic air attacks without having to bear the responsibility of feeding Japan's 80 million people." Regarding this important issue, the reporter compared his own notes with those of Chicago Daily News reporter Peachy and International News Service Far East Manager Hentermann, and the results were completely identical. Royall said that any form of strict telegram and decisive battle bound by Asia will be won in Europe. He said: "But if we are driven out of Western Europe, it will take fifteen to thirty years to return to Western Europe, but even if we lose Alaska and the Aleutians, there is still an easier way to attack the United States. At the same time, the US air bases in Western Europe, Britain, or even Iceland can achieve strategic goals far better than Alaska or the Far East." Royall said that he doubted whether a war would break out in the Far East or whether the Soviet Union would invade Japan and bear the responsibility of supporting Japan's 80 million people. He also said: "In my opinion, we have no obligation to Japan. The impression of the war is still fresh in our minds. I don't think we have any moral or other obligation to protect the Japanese people." Then Royall told the reporters that he thought it might be better to withdraw from Japan before the war broke out. Royall mentioned at least twice that the US Army was reviewing the entire US situation in the Pacific. He said that China controlled by the Chinese Communists is not a special military asset to the Soviet Union, or a threat to the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th of the Month] Secretary of the Army Royall, following a statement by Secretary of State Acheson today, again bluntly denied at a press conference that he had said that if the Soviet Union invaded Japan, the US military would abandon the area. Royall said, "What I said was the opposite, that the United States does not intend to change the strength of US troops stationed in Japan and is prepared to deal with any aggression." The reporter then asked about various issues reported in Tokyo, and Royall replied, "Although I met with many reporters on the 6th, I did not discuss the strategy of the US military in Japan." When asked if anyone else present at the time had made the statement, Royall said: "As far as I remember, no one said that if a war broke out, the United States would withdraw from Japan." When asked whether Deputy Chief of Staff Wedemeyer, who accompanied him to Japan, or officials from MacArthur's headquarters were present, Royall replied: "No."</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 16th of the Month] US Secretary of the Army Royall admitted on the 16th that the "senior US official" who held discussions with newspaper reporters in Tokyo was Royall himself.</p>

<h3>Public Bus Strike in the City Ends: Three Employees Executed by Firing Squad, Another Six Drivers and Ticket Sellers Sentenced to Imprisonment, Full Service Expected to Resume Today</h3>
<p>[Report] The Garrison Command executed three employees of the Public Transportation Bus Company of the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM: Zhong Quanzhou, a worker in the maintenance yard; Gu Bokang, driver of car number 944; and Wang Yuan, driver of car number 381. According to the Garrison Command's announcement: the three men "took the lead in gathering the masses on February 16 of this year, making unreasonable demands on the company for 6 shi of rice for contingency expenses and 1 shi of rice for meal subsidies, and inciting all employees to strike. At the same time, they incited the French-owned tram to stop running, and all roads of transportation were suddenly cut off, disrupting order and endangering public safety to the utmost extent. They have been arrested and interrogated about the previous situation. During this period of martial law, Gu Bokang and others dared to coerce the public and disrupt security. The headquarters had no choice but to enforce the law and sentenced them to death."</p>
<p>Gu Bokang was 39 years old, from Zhuji, Xinjiang; Zhong Quanzhou was 30 years old, from Zhenhai, Zhejiang; and Wang Yuan was 31 years old, from Zhenhai, Zhejiang. The three were arrested and sent to the Garrison Command at 3:00 AM yesterday morning. After being tried by the Military Law Department in the morning, they were presented to Commander Chen for approval and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM, the three were taken from the detention center. The executioner told them that they were ordered to be executed. Gu Bokang burst into tears upon hearing this. Zhong Quanzhou and Wang Yuan were both terrified. The three still hoped that the company authorities would rescue them, but the judge told them that it was impossible. Then, they jointly wrote a will, mainly asking the company to prove their usual actions and previous acceptance of orders to mediate for the company. Finally, after each was injected with anesthesia and drank sorghum liquor, they were escorted onto a prison car and rushed to the execution ground, where they were killed by several shots.</p>
<p>Those who were arrested at the same time as Gu Bokang and others included drivers and ticket sellers Wang Qiuping, Zhu Fusheng, Shen Pengjie, Yu Qinxue, Xu Kuijun, and Wang Changming. Because their circumstances were lighter, they have been sentenced to imprisonment.</p>
<p>[Additional News] Zhao, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the public transportation company's employee strike has come to an end. As of yesterday afternoon, more than 2,000 of the company's drivers and ticket sellers had registered with the company to return to work, accounting for 80% of the total number. It is said that the remaining 20% are either those who had already requested leave for personal or medical reasons. It was announced that starting at 4:30 PM yesterday, some buses on lines 3 and 10 had already started running. Director Zhao told reporters with a firm tone that full service can be restored starting tomorrow (i.e., today). The company authorities are currently conducting a review of the qualifications of the employees who have registered to return to work by the Reinstatement Employee Qualification Review Committee and will try to retain all of them unless they have committed serious misconduct in the past.</p>
<h3>Frequent Labor Strikes in This City: Mr. Chen Daqing Speaks, Expressing Four Hopes to All Parties; Disruptive Elements Will Be Strictly Controlled</h3>
<p>Recently, labor strikes have been occurring frequently in this city, greatly affecting transportation, production, and social order. Mr. Chen Daqing, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, issued the following statement on this matter:</p>
<p>Recently, labor strikes have been occurring frequently in this city. For example, the workers of the French Tramway Company, the Transportation Company's public buses, and the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways have successively gone on strike. The impact of these strikes is sufficient to cause production to cease, transportation to be interrupted, and society to become uneasy. We should clearly recognize that public utilities such as transportation and state-owned enterprises belong to the state, and their sovereignty belongs to the people. No one can arbitrarily control or obstruct them for any reason. As for private enterprises, factories, and companies, although they are privately owned, their purpose is to serve the people and benefit society. They cannot be arbitrarily monopolized or destroyed for any reason. If someone deliberately incites labor disputes, they are a criminal against society and a public enemy of the people. Based on the above reasons, I would like to express several hopes and requests to all relevant parties: (1) Labor unions in all industries should earnestly guide and train workers to understand that their mission is to serve society and the people, and that they cannot arbitrarily strike and cause social unrest. (2) Capitalists should understand that they exist because of society and should also seek to coexist with society. They should automatically make reasonable adjustments to workers' wages so that they can work with peace of mind. (3) Workers in all industries should recognize the environment and their responsibilities, and strive to work hard. Any demands should only be resolved reasonably and in a reasonable manner. They must not be exploited by others, act emotionally, endanger society, or sacrifice themselves. (4) All schemers and selfish elements who attempt to use workers and youth as tools for factional and political struggles, not hesitating to sacrifice others to satisfy their personal desires, their despicable, insidious, and unscrupulous behavior will ultimately be despised by the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>It is my duty to ensure the safety of all the people in the city. I will adopt all effective methods to strictly punish the few elements who disrupt public order.</p>

<h3>National Bank Suspended Yarn Sales Yesterday: Will Adopt Flexible Policy in the Future</h3>
<p>The National Bank's suspension of yarn sales in the market for several consecutive days has led to a continuous surge in yarn and cloth prices. This has raised concerns among all parties. No yarn was sold yesterday. When asked about this, a senior official from the National Bank stated that the bank has decided not to sell yarn in the market on a daily basis anymore, but will adopt a flexible policy.</p>
<p>In other news, the National Bank's suspension of yarn and cloth sales is temporary and may be restored within a day or two. Because the National Bank believes that the price of gold is rising even more sharply, it has significantly increased gold sales. In terms of tightening the money supply, this is actually more effective than selling yarn and cloth.</p>
<h3>More Yarn Prices Fell Than Rose</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market experienced drastic price fluctuations. At the morning opening, buying interest was strong, and upward momentum surged. However, near noon, the upward momentum suddenly stalled, and various yarns quickly reversed direction, resulting in more prices falling than rising. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn initially traded at 710,000 yuan, 90,000 yuan higher than before, but ultimately plunged to 590,000 yuan at the close, a drop of 30,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon yarn declined slightly by 15,000 yuan, ending at 450,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse yarn appeared, consistently breaking through the 385,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan level.

Other yarns, such as Golden Rooster and Heavenly Maiden, experienced mixed fortunes. 16-count Bright yarn fell below the 300,000 yuan mark, trading at 295,000 yuan, a decline of 10,000 yuan. Other 10-count yarns also softened.</p>
<h3>New Prices Seen in Cotton Cloth Market</h3>
<p>At the cloth market opening this morning, numerous favorable news reports circulated, greatly boosting morale. Most holders were reluctant to sell, while buyers searched to purchase. Market speculators took advantage of the situation to drive up prices, resulting in an unprecedented rise in prices for all types of cloth. Dragon Head Fine Cloth was generally quoted at around 16,000 yuan, but due to extremely tight supply, no goods were available, resulting in a situation where there was a market but no goods. Trumpet Boy Fine Cloth opened at 14,400 yuan, briefly fell to 13,700 yuan, and then rebounded, ultimately closing at 13,900 yuan, 1,900 yuan higher than before.

<p>The money market in the city yesterday trended towards stability. The arrival of remittances from other cities provided ample funds for businesses, resulting in more supply than demand. However, some businesses still faced tight liquidity due to turnover issues. The overnight lending rate ranged from a high of 90 yuan to a low of 70 yuan, with some supply available, generally hovering around 80 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to salary disbursements by industrial and commercial enterprises, cash supply was insufficient to meet demand, and promissory notes remained popular, with discount rates as high as 6% or 7%.</p>

<h3>Leather Industry in Peril</h3>
<p>Raw Material Prices Soaring, Production Costs Increasing</p>
<p>The leather industry in this city is facing a serious crisis: (1) The raw cowhide required for leather production originally came entirely from the Xuzhou-Bengbu area. Now, the source has almost been cut off, causing raw material prices to soar, while the prices of finished products are lower than the cost. (2) The leather production process is extremely complex, constantly requiring several months, poor turnover, and prices change several times a day, making it extremely difficult. (3) Cowhide is also one of the export commodities. When the source is lacking, plus exports, the supply in this city cannot meet the demand, resulting in abnormal adjustments. The industry is currently requesting the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to prohibit the export of cowhide. There are a total of 370 leather factories in this city, of which those engaged in manual leather production account for eight-tenths. Machine-made and semi-machine-made account for one-tenth. The monthly output is estimated at 530,000 pounds of machine-made sole leather, 200,000 pounds of green leather, 180,000 pounds of handmade sole leather, 780,000 pounds of face leather, and other types such as Moroccan leather, Swift leather, and sand factory belts, cowhide suitcase leather, etc., are also produced in considerable quantities, with a monthly requirement of 1.4 million pounds of dry cowhide.</p>

It is learned that tea shops in this city such as Yuan Long, Chun Ji, and Tong Taixiang, given that tea sales in Suzhou and Wuxi are continuing, are planning to launch a new spring offensive, attempting to encroach on various types and varieties of tea.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Initially Firm, Then Soft</h3>
<p>In yesterday's tung oil market, the market was initially supported by abundant funds and a bullish close the night before, with sellers pushing prices up all the way. Then, news that the authorities were selling off large quantities of goods caused all goods outside the circle to falter, and tung oil followed suit.

<h3>New York Mile Race: American, Dutch, and Swedish Triad Compete for Victory; Gagliano's Astonishing Performance</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from New York for This Newspaper] In Madison Square Garden, an intense indoor sports meet is underway. The lights are dazzling, and music is playing, with the national anthems of the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States played in succession. The mile race is about to begin. The Dutchman Sleekuis and the Swede Bengtsson are both famous athletes in the world games. These two national anthems are a tribute to them. The "Wanamaker" mile race has never been won by a foreigner. This year, after the retirement of American mile champion Shutts, no one has emerged to take his place in long-distance running. The only American competitor is the bespectacled 21-year-old young man Gagliano from the University of Wisconsin. Several weeks ago, he had a trial run in Madison and achieved an astonishing time of four minutes and six and one-tenth seconds, only eight-tenths of a second behind Dues's indoor record. If this record holds, many say he has the potential for a shocking creation. After the starting gun, Gagliano, wearing a red jersey, took the lead. At the half-mile mark, the announcer reported his time as two minutes and two seconds. Second place was Sleekuis, closely following. Bengtsson, suffering from a toothache and with his mouth full of penicillin, was dispirited and obviously far behind, giving up the race. At the three-quarter-mile mark, the Dutchman had surged ahead, with a time of three minutes and eight seconds. Gagliano thought to himself that he was confident he could win the final sprint, and he was very sure he could break four minutes and five and three-tenths seconds. On the final 34-yard straight track, he indeed emerged, sprinting like a short-distance runner, and defeated Sleekuis by five yards, with a time of four minutes and nine and five-tenths seconds. Gagliano said that he was a bit out of form tonight and didn't achieve a good result. Before the band had finished playing, the cheers of the Belgians resounded. Biel Van Rief, the world champion in the 5,000 meters, indeed won the two-mile race, with a record of eight minutes and fifty-six and one-tenth seconds, the best result after his wife Rief.</p>

<h3>Talking About the South in the Midst of the Southern Relocation</h3>
<p>—Si Ming</p>
<p>The city of Guangzhou in the past three months is vastly different from what it used to be. Amidst this turbulent situation and the talk of the government relocating to the south, officials are gathering here. Although it has only been a short three months, there have already been significant changes.</p>
<p>The surge in civil servants from various regions and "refugees" seeking evacuation has caused a sudden increase in the city's population. As a result, several bustling streets are constantly packed, and the neon lights of various shops at night compete in their splendor to attract customers. This is something that the Shanghai night market, which is in decline, can only dream of. There is no curfew here, and the city is open all night. Due to the population surge, the market has suddenly become prosperous, and the original power supply is no longer sufficient. Therefore, a system of rotational power outages in different areas has been implemented. However, even at night, the lights are still shining brightly, and teahouses, restaurants, theaters, and opera houses are all thriving, making threefold profits. The heavily made-up female servers greet customers with smiles.</p>
<p>Few Cars, Many People</p>
<p>The wealthy individuals with "03" and "04" license plates speed along the asphalt roads covered in dust, along with Guangzhou's "16" license plates. The number of cars, though not small, points to the city's prosperity. The municipal government is preparing to ban the issuance of new car licenses to maintain traffic flow. There are no trams here, only some dilapidated and poorly designed "long-distance buses." With few cars and many people, everyone struggles to squeeze in like sardines. There are full-fare tickets and "military-police" tickets. In reality, the military and police officers are brazenly riding "霸王車" (unpaid), while ordinary citizens are purchasing "military-police" tickets. Only a few young ladies and wives are neither "military-police" nor "public educators" and have no choice but to pay full fare. Whether you buy a ticket or not, as long as you hold your head high and purse your lips, the ticket seller won't dare to ask too many questions. Perhaps this is the servility developed from long-term oppression.</p>
<p>Knowing Only the Country</p>
<p>A few days ago, I went to Huangpu for some business. When I boarded the bus, it was full of people in uniform. As usual, they were riding without tickets. The ticket seller grumbled a few times, which angered them. They started to shout, "Damn it, we've been fighting for years, shedding blood and sweat, and ended up with our families scattered and people dead. We only know the country and don't know our homes. Yet, even riding the bus is frowned upon. It's because the country is poor, not because we don't want to buy tickets!" Hearing this, my heart ached.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Huangpu</p>
<p>Huangpu, a major southern port and the gateway to Guangzhou, has become even more important after the war. In the past, ships could sail directly into the city, but after years of war, the Pearl River has become shallower. Now, foreign passengers and goods can only be unloaded in Huangpu and then transported to the city by barges or cars. Here, the cradle of the army and the birthplace of the Northern Expedition, the Huangpu Military Academy stands tall. Time is merciless. Although its spirit is immortal, its shell – the school site – is dilapidated. Recently, amidst the talks of relocating the military academy to the south, this muddy little gathering place is bustling and bustling, creating a whole new world.</p>
<p>High-Pressure Living</p>
<p>With Premier Sun's high-pressure living style coming to Guangzhou, the mood of the citizens is particularly heavy. Is there a split between the government and the parliament? Will the peace talks fail? As a result, the Gold Yuan Note depreciates again and again, and prices soar again and again, creating unprecedented volatility and chaos. The common people are gasping for breath under this high-pressure whip. Since Guangzhou is close to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong dollar has become a favorite. Gold shops and "cigarette" vendors are as numerous as carps crossing the river, specializing in the open but forbidden trade of foreign currency. Most prices have been changed to a base point system. In fact, the base point is a disguised Hong Kong dollar base, which is multiplied by the black market exchange rate to convert it into Gold Yuan Notes. This is much more flexible than Shanghai's bi-monthly cost-of-living index. Therefore, it is no longer a daily jump but fluctuates every moment. Even municipal donations and taxes will implement a base point system.</p>
<p>Taking Risks</p>
<p>The bandits in South China have always been known for their ferocity. Security in the suburbs is not guaranteed. The successive hijackings on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway have turned people pale. Even open robberies and petty thefts in the city have become commonplace. After dark, pedestrians in quiet streets and alleys are mostly wary. With the unrestricted rise in prices and a large number of unemployed people, it is no wonder that many people are taking risks these days.</p>
<p>Leisurely Eating</p>
<p>The abundance and novelty of the restaurants here will make your mouth water. It is worth mentioning that there are unique flavors here that you can't find in Shanghai: dog meat, cat meat, snake meat, etc. Because Guangzhou is close to Hong Kong and Macau, there is an abundance of foreign goods, especially the vendors in the bustling areas. The candies, biscuits, and snacks are colorful and varied. The scale of capital is beyond your imagination. Teahouses are busy three times a day and are always crowded with people. A friend from Shanghai asked me, why are the Cantonese so free? Is this a habit of the two Cantonese regions? I had no answer.</p>
<p>Southern Women</p>
<p>If a modern city should be adorned with fashionable women, then Guangzhou is lagging behind. In my three months in Guangzhou, I have rarely seen stylishly dressed ladies. I remember someone saying that French women have charm, German women have health, American women have cuteness, British women have stability, and Japanese women have gentleness, while Shanghai ladies combine all of these qualities. Although this statement is exaggerated, it does show how much they are admired. I don't deny the phrase "Southern beauties." There are many beautiful girls in Shanghai, but from the perspective of a modern city, their clothing is not fashionable enough. However, if you look at it with a different mindset, perhaps this is the simplicity of our people.</p>
<h3>Jinhua Ham Strives for Revival and Seeks Development</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Jiang Feng</p>
<p>[Reported from Jinhua on the 14th by This Newspaper] When mentioning Jinhua, everyone will think of ham. Indeed, Jinhua ham, which is as famous as Xuanwei ham in Yunnan, has a better aroma than other hams. Jinhua ham is not only produced in Jinhua but also in Dongyang, Lanxi, Pujiang, Yiwu, Yongkang, Wuyi, Tangxi, and other counties belonging to the old Jinhua Prefecture, all of which are collectively called "Jinhua ham." The reason why Jinhua ham is famous at home and abroad is that the manufacturing method is appropriate, but the Jinhua pig breed is different from ordinary pigs, which is the main factor. Jinhua pigs have thin skin, thin bones, short limbs, less subcutaneous fat, particularly developed muscles, fine meat fibers, and are not very heavy. They usually grow for ten months and weigh about 130 catties. The characteristics of the shape is a narrow and long back, a curved waist, a pointed mouth, a long neck, and short limbs. The hair color is mostly black on the head and tail, and white on the four feet and waist.</p>
<p>Pig Feeding Methods</p>
<p>Most farmers in Jinhua take pig raising as a side business. The feeding method is similar to the general method, but the feed is better. Usually, the first day after the sow gives birth, feed it with glutinous rice porridge, followed by soy milk, to make its milk abundant. When the piglets can eat feed, feed them rice, rice soup, or wheat porridge, and then gradually give them a mixture of 10% barley and 40% bean and wheat flour porridge. After eight or nine weeks, they can be weaned and raised separately. After weaning, they are fed in the pigsty. The pigsty is padded with rice straw and wheat straw, and attention is paid to changing it at any time to keep it clean and dry. The usual feed is the leftovers from human food, rice washing water, wild vegetables, and barley flour. Two months before slaughter, better feed is given to fatten them, such as barley porridge, carrot porridge, etc., and sometimes mixed with tofu dregs and wine dregs. During the growing period, it is forbidden to let them run around in the pen, and attention is paid to their hygiene.</p>
<p>The salting method of ham is generally believed that the ham is pickled in a kiln vat, and a dog's leg must be placed in each vat for the whole vat of ham to have a good aroma. In fact, this method is only used by farmers for small-scale salting. Large-scale ham making is not like this.</p>
<p>Leg House and Leg Bed</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the selection of the pickling room and the structure of the leg bed: The prerequisite for building a leg house is to have light but not too dry and not very ventilated. Other important conditions include preventing the intrusion of flies and mice. Therefore, most choose the downstairs room where the ground is humid, and choose a room with neat and square attic bars. 排釘 (Rows of nails) are placed on the attic to prepare for hanging the legs.</p>
<p>The structure of the leg bed is made of wood. The two feet at one end are slightly higher to allow salt water to flow out. The frame is about eight feet long and about three feet wide. It is covered with alternately facing half-split bamboo tubes, with the joints removed to make it smooth. The leg bed is placed in the pickling room, and several pieces are placed according to its size.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the criteria for selecting legs. In terms of weight, before the war, legs of about 20 catties were selected. In recent years, due to the impact of low purchasing power, large hams are not selling well, so fresh legs of about 10 to 12 catties are selected. In terms of quality, white hair and white toes, thick lean meat and thin fat layer, small limbs, thin and strong skin are the best choice.</p>
<p>Pickling Process</p>
<p>After the leg selection is completed, pickling is started. Now, the process is described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) 整腿: Use a knife to trim the leg meat to make it look beautiful, remove the grease film on the fresh leg, and wipe off the leg congestion.</p>
<p>(2) 椒鹽: Sprinkle a finger's thickness of salt on the leg center, and other places can be slightly thinner. Also, wipe a small amount of salt on the skin surface. After that, salt must be sprinkled each time when flipping the leg, but the amount can be slightly reduced. Some do not sprinkle salt at the last time. It is estimated that about one or one and a half taels of salt is required for one catty of fresh legs.</p>
<p>(3) 疊腿: After the first salting, the leg stacking work is started. First, place the legs facing up in the leg bed. After one layer is full, place two bamboo 蔑 (strips) on the legs. These 蔑 (strips) should be placed on the tail ridge bone. In this way, ten layers can be stacked tightly. Those with excellent skills can stack up to fifteen layers.</p>
<p>(4) 糊腿: Three days after stacking the legs, the first leg flipping is done. First, place the legs one by one on an empty bed, sprinkle some salt, and flip the legs onto the empty bed, using the same method as stacking the legs. Usually, the legs are flipped three times, about every four days. However, according to custom, if it rains, the legs must be 　(cleaned), to prevent them from rotting. Under normal conditions, it takes 12 to 15 days from the first salting to the last flipping of the legs. After that, stack them for another half month, and the leg washing work can be done.</p>
<p>(5) 洗腿: Soak the legs in water for seven or eight hours to allow the rotten substances and salt to gradually dissolve, and then clean them.</p>
<p>(6) 製腿: Press the two sides of the leg with both hands until the shape is full, and then hammer the knee. Also, insert the leg claw into the orange hole, which is tied in advance, so that the claw tip is curved. Then, scrape off the greasy oil on the outer skin with a knife, and then print the trademark.</p>
<p>(7) 晒腿: After the trademark is printed, place the legs facing up on the 蔑 (strip) mat to dry. After they are slightly dry, tie the leg claws with ropes and hang them on wooden racks to sun-dry until the leg skin turns red and oil透 (permeates).</p>
<p>(8) 修腿: Before selling, the legs must be trimmed once to make them smooth and flat.</p>
<p>Types of Jinhua Ham</p>
<p>The finished ham can be divided into the following types:</p>
<p>(1) 雪舫: Those pickled from Minor Snow to Major Snow have good quality and are the best among hams.</p>
<p>(2) 直冬: Those pickled in the dead of winter are also called "眞冬."</p>
<p>(3) 醬腿: A layer of soybean paste is applied to the outside during the last salting. It is brushed off when washing the legs. Although the appearance is inferior, the taste is better than ordinary hams. This kind of product is not produced much and is mostly used for self-consumption.</p>
<p>(4) 月腿: Often the front leg is used, and the limb bones are cut off, and the shape is like a团月 (round moon), hence the name.</p>
<p>(5) 竹葉燻腿: Hang the fresh legs on the stove and smoke them for more than a month. Most are not salted, and the taste is sweet and light.</p>
<p>(6) 深山野味: Made with wild boar legs, black hair is often left as a sign, and the taste is fresh and different.</p>
<p>(7) 戌腿: Made with dog legs, the taste is also very good, and it is mostly used by 번 (??).</p>
<p>(8) 風肉: Pickled in the past, but not cut into a round moon shape, the meat is thicker, and the taste is inferior.</p>
<p>Leg making is a sideline for farmers in the old Jinhua Prefecture counties. In recent decades, due to the oversupply, it has gradually transitioned to centralized production, becoming a workshop form. Each workshop employs a technician who can make more than a thousand hams each year. If a helper is hired in addition to the technician, about three thousand hams can be pickled. Technicians are paid very well, with a monthly salary of 5.6 dan of rice, and some are as high as more than a thousand catties. Ordinary middle and upper-class farmers still produce it as a sideline. Each winter, they make several hams, and the farmers inherit the ancestral methods and pickle them by hand without hiring others to operate.</p>
<p>Total Production Volume</p>
<p>Before the war, the total output of ham in Jinhua counties was more than 800,000 pieces. Among them, Dongyang had the largest output, with an estimated annual output of about 300,000 pieces. Second is Lanxi, with an annual output of 200,000 pieces. Yiwu and Jinhua rank third, with an annual output of about 150,000 pieces each. Yongkang and Pujiang each have about 30,000 to 40,000 pieces. Wuyi and Tangxi also have a combined annual output of more than 10,000 pieces. The annual output of each county varies, depending entirely on market supply and demand. The above-mentioned hams, except for some that are directly transported to Shanghai and Hangzhou by leg merchants, are mostly collected and distributed in Jinhua.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, due to various reasons such as raw materials, capital, and sales channels, the production of Jinhua ham once declined sharply to almost no production. Especially after the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Incident in 1942, the entire production area fell into the hands of the Japanese. The enemy often looted everywhere, and few people were willing to raise pigs. Raw materials became a problem, and coupled with the lack of industrial security and the despair of foreign sales, Jinhua ham almost disappeared.</p>
<p>Last Year's Production Volume</p>
<p>After the victory, ham production was expected to recover quickly. However, since the counties of Jinhua had been in enemy hands for three years, the vitality of the rural areas had not recovered, and the production of ham was still sluggish, only reaching one-third of the pre-war level. Last year, it seemed to be gradually recovering, with signs of prosperity, but compared with before the war, it was still far behind. According to insiders, Dongyang still ranked first in production last year, with about 150,000 pieces. Jinhua 　登 ranked second, with only about 100,000 pieces. Lanxi and Yiwu each had about 60,000 to 70,000 pieces, Yongkang had 30,000 pieces, and Pujiang and Wuyi had about 20,000 pieces. The approximate number was only more than 400,000 pieces, which was slightly more than half of the pre-war level.</p>
<p>Road to Revival</p>
<p>Although Jinhua ham has gradually resumed its revival and regrouped, due to the depletion of the rural economy, the depletion of capital in the leg industry, and the inability to restore the pre-war level of production, it seems that it wants to rise but lacks strength. However, ham has suddenly become one of the precious specialties of eastern Zhejiang and should have a promising future. In addition to reporting, I sincerely feel that the Jinhua leg industry needs to be revitalized urgently, and I hope that the government should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Establish a pig breeding farm in Jinhua to breed excellent pig breeds to increase the source of raw materials.</p>
<p>(2) Encourage farmers to raise pigs universally.</p>
<p>(3) Establish a commodity inspection system and standardize the quality of production areas to compete for overseas markets and enrich the rural economy.</p>
<p>(4) Guide farmers to improve ham production technology.</p>

<h3>Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway Powerhouse: Heshan Coal Mine Faces Difficulties</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Liang Yushan</p>
<p>[Airmail Report from Guilin on the 14th by This Newspaper] Due to the impact of the situation, the task of the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway, which connects the southwest, is becoming more and more onerous, and the problems that need to be solved are becoming more and more urgent. Today, the power problem of the railway is obviously more important than anything else. At present, the railway needs more than 13,000 tons of coal per month, mainly from Heshan, Qiyang, Dapu, and other places. The quality of the coal is very poor except for that produced in Heshan, which contains half sand and soil. In the past, the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway could not climb the high slopes above Liujia without Heshan coal.</p>
<p>The Heshan Coal Mine is located in Qianjiang County, Guangxi Province, with the Heshan and Heli mines. The quality of Heli's products is not pure and cannot be used as machine fuel. The Heshan mine has been mined for more than ten years and is about to be exhausted, from a daily output of 130 tons to a daily output of 70 tons. In May last year, Heshan Coal Mining Company discovered the Dong Mine coalfield in Niulan, eight miles east of the original mine. The reserves are about 500,000 tons. At a daily output of 150 tons of coal, it can be mined for ten years. After this new power was discovered, the mine began construction, but due to limited financial resources, the mining project only opened eight level lanes, and the daily output of coal was only 30 tons, which was far from the original plan. After the products are produced, the transportation problem also follows. To transport the coal energy out continuously, a five-kilometer-long light railway branch line must be built before the rainy season this year. This project alone is enough to make the mine difficult. A five-kilometer light railway with 35-pound rails has more than 100,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, and more than 20 large and small culverts. In addition to materials, the wages alone require more than 2 million catties of rice. If the light rail can be built on schedule, the nearly 2,000 production and transportation workers at the mine railway will also have to eat every day. At a time when production is extremely difficult and coal prices cannot keep up with prices, it is really not easy to cope with such a large scene. At present, the mine is facing these many difficulties. The funds for building the convenience road cannot be borrowed, and the production of coal mines is therefore suffocated. The power fuel for the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway will also be blocked. The mine is now calling out loudly, requesting the government to assist.</p>
<p>A Storm in the Guilin Provincial and Municipal Circles</p>
<p>[Reported from Guilin on the 11th by This Newspaper] A small storm has recently arisen in the long-quiet provincial and municipal circles. Recently, the Guilin Municipal Council had opinions with the Municipal Bank and the Police Bureau, which has to be said to be a pity in the unity attack center. On the 7th of this month, the Municipal Council held the 12th session of the Standing Committee. The first two days were to listen to the Municipal Government's policy report, and on the 10th, the Municipal Bank and the Police Bureau were invited to attend the General Assembly for consultation. At that time, both units refused to attend, causing dissatisfaction among all the councilors, and six people, including the speaker and councilors, were sent to the provincial government and the provincial security department to file a joint complaint, while postponing the meeting to await orders.</p>
<p>The police bureau's view is simple, and the attitude is mitigated afterward. The reason given is that the police bureau is a provincial-level agency and has no precedent for attending county and city meetings to report. If it is necessary to consult on municipal security, please send a letter to inquire at any time. Finally, it was expressed that it was willing to wait for the approval of the provincial government and the provincial security department.</p>
<p>The Municipal Bank's attitude is tough, and it goes to extremes with the council, presenting many reasons for refusing to attend. It said that the Municipal Bank is a special limited company jointly run by the government and merchants. All business operations are carried out by a manager who is responsible to the shareholders' meeting or the board of directors in accordance with the regulations. If the council wants to inquire about the bank's business, it needs to talk to the bank. The manager of the bank, Chen Shouyun, firmly stated that he would never accept the council's opinions. Even if the superior agency instructed, he said: "The mayor is the chairman of the municipal bank and the speaker is the standing supervisor. The bank acts as the municipal treasury and other businesses. The council members can directly go to the bank to inquire. It is not discrimination against the council, but there is no need to attend the report." He finally reiterated that if the council insisted on making things difficult for him, he would at most leave. The council is still continuing to postpone the meeting, and this deadlock seems to be awaiting Chairman Huang to resolve it.</p>
