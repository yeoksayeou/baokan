<p>〔本報南京十日電〕中共當局已於十日下令，停止軍事進攻，此為李代總統於十日晚十時接獲北平方面之電報所說明者，聞此項命令係中共當局於十日發出，但抵達各前綫部隊之時間，將在一二日之後。預測戰事之延續，當可於短期內吿一段落。此為代表團抵平交換意見後之最大成就。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕中共所提和談基礎之八項條件，第一項戰犯問題，在和談正式開始前之個別接觸中，已獲得轉好之進展，中共已同意處理尺度可予放鬆，故戰犯問題顯已不成為問題之焦點矣。正式和談十日尙朱開始，但根據北平方面之報吿，目前最為重要者，厥為會前之交換意見，在此期間首先將八項條件逐條洽商討論，俟每一條均能獲有協議，然後舉行正式會議，而各項條件商得協議之結果，卽可於會議開始後簽訂和約‘照目前情形觀之，和談可能順利進展。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕和談中有關整軍問題，政府軍事要員續在商討中，十日下午四時李代總統及何院長在國防部召集徐永昌，顧祝同，白崇禧，胡宗南，林蔚，郭懺等十人舉行會議，商談兩小時許始散。</p>
<p>〔本報南十日電〕政府決選派大員赴平，協助和談事，十日尙未確定人選，續在徵詢中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕國民黨中常會通過設置之和談指導委員會，今後對和談之決策，將有重大影響。委負十一人，由李宗仁負責主持，除孫科在穗外，其餘于右任，居正，何應欽，童冠賢，張羣，吳忠信，朱家驊，徐永昌等均在京，吳鐵城十日下午由穗飛抵滬，將於十一日晨七時來京。實際上過去和談之進行，上述十一委員卽曾參議決策。中常會通過設置該會以後，卽將秉承中常會之指示，經常研究並處理和談中之一切問題，以資迅捷。據悉：該會並不一定經常舉行會議，遇有重要問題，卽由全體委員或一部份委員隨時會商，予以解決。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十日電〕政府人士九日晚澈夜研討毛澤東致李代總統的覆電後，對和平的希望現已加濃。某高級官方人士評述中共所作之讓步及毛澤東在覆電中的溫和的詞句稱：此可能為中共「最後改變初衷，決定使北平談判成功的奇蹟的第一步」。渠稱：中共放棄立卽渡江及政府必須在四月十二日前表明最後態度的要求，已使國共間的距離稍趨接近。渠稱：毛澤東的覆電中，有兩點殊具鼓勵性，其一，中共現已同意將渠等之要求限於八項條件的範圍以內，其二，中共對懲辦戰犯問題的死結，可能讓步。據悉：政府目前對「懲辦戰犯」一點的立塲，僅同意在和平解決後，禁止列名「戰犯人的人士參與聯合政府。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十日電〕在京國民黨立法委員十日晨九時在石婆婆巷舉行秘密座談會。商討黨務改革及時局問題，出席黃宇人·范予遂·甘家馨·黃統·邱昌渭·王啟江·白瑜·劉不同·武和軒等八十餘人，包華國主席，各委員熱烈發言，對和談及黨務改革與目前時局廣泛交換意見，當決定對目前時局發表一聯合宣言，表明：（一）絕對支持和談，（二）希望行政院確實作到對立法院負責，（三）打倒豪門，政治上取消包辦，（四）反對慕後操縱，並推定黃宇人·包華國·王孟鄰·甘家馨等負責起草。此外，復決定成立一聯合機構，推涂公遂·邱昌渭·張靜愚·鄒樹文·陳顧遠等起草組織規程，下次會時再提出討論。十日座談係由黃宇人·甘家馨·邱昌渭·黃統·范予遂等所發起，被邀請者多為見解大致相同之國民黨立委，過去已舉行會議兩次，十日係第三次集會，會中首由邱昌渭報吿和談情形，謂和談進行順利，戰犯問題可望緩和，共軍確不致於和談期間渡江，第三方面人士現在居間促成，中共希望政府人士到北平看看，相信前途當可樂觀，惟不管和談成敗，將來共軍究竟過江與否，則殊難斷言。繼由黃宇人報吿對黨務改革意見，各委員卽紛紛發言，痛陳過去黨務之錯誤，非有澈底改革，不足以挽救危局，迄十二時始散。</p>

<p>〔本報長沙十日電」湘主席程潛為澄淸輿論，息止謠言，十日特發表文長千餘字之書面談話，茲摘要如下：</p>
<p>「最近和談進行，除極少數份子外，相信大多數人必希望其順利成功，現在兩方軍隊及地方團隊總在二千萬以上，驅之於無意義的鬥爭，不獨不能生產，而且兩方都要消耗人力物力，如繼續打下去人種亦將滅亡，言念及此，稍具天良者莫不痛心，因此大家望和甚切，至我列名為戰犯之一，我不加辯白，願接受人民的公判，倘眞認我有戰犯罪行，雖碎屍萬段，亦所不辭。湖南是三千萬人民的湖南，我不承認少數人以主人自居，而能左右大多數人民的命運，更反對存心偏私，不顧大衆死活的人出賣湖南，我以至誠至正的決心，求使湖南免於戰禍，人民免於砲火，社會秩序安定，地方元氣保全，希望在此安危所繫的關頭，大家協力滿足此一要求：長沙為地方行政的神經中樞，要保持安定，不可自相驚擾，尤不可輕信謠言，一切投機取巧，自作聰明的言論，無補於實際。最後程氏警吿「不再標新立異自亂步驟，不再自掘墳墓徒苦人民」。</p>
<p>〔本報長沙十日電〕此間工商報載「頌（程潛）公願作傅作義」，又四月七日學生遊行亦高呼「要求與北平看齊」，怪論百出，人心浮動，程潛除發表書面談話外，並以工商報立言荒謬，己手令予以永久停刋處分。</p>

<p>〔本報昆明十日電〕滇省委楊文淸，前代表盧主席晋京謁李代總統，商談滇境有關諸問題，並街命赴港訪候龍前主席，已於十日午公畢返昆，據談，龍雲在港身體健康，外傳種種不足深信，龍氏暫時無意返滇。楊氏末語記者，此行頗圓滿，訂十一日謁盧主席報吿經過。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社香港十日電〕龍雲長子龍繩武稱：其父對李代總統邀請重任雲南主席一事，暫時尙無決定。其父接受李代總統之邀請，有三個先決條件：（一）雲南應採取一種穩定之通貨，（二）應有平衡之經濟，使雲南可以應付其本身之需要，而無須南京之援助。（三）建立雲南軍隊。龍繩武證實渠曾代表其父訪問南京，其父因健康不佳，不克親自前往。又稱：龍雲返滇一事，「可能極為複雜」，而其態度將繫於國民政府之立塲及雲南人民之輿論。消息靈通人士稱：龍雲在政治方面，向以謹愼著稱，故對於李代總統之邀請，遲疑不決。渠自然希望返回本省，但似將避免任何足以引起共黨猜疑之行動，此間共黨報紙迄今為止，尙未刋載任何敵視龍雲之消息，或係由於渠對蔣總統之敵視態度。同一人士相信，龍雲近曾拒絕訪問華北，然曾致函其舊友現在北平之國民黨革命委負會主席李濟琛，說明由於「健康不佳」，不能成行。此間消息靈通人士否認龍雲與現任雲南主席盧漢關係不佳之說，反之，盧漢之省政府中，留用龍雲昔日之友人甚多，盧氏並與龍雲經常保持接觸。此間某英國商人曾在昆明居留數年之久，最近返港談稱：此說似極不可靠，因龍雲與盧漢不僅為親戚，且同隸一旅，並為親密朋友。渠認為政府之行動，蓋由於雲南境內叛亂紛起。過去數週中叛軍曾佔領城鎭二十餘處，同時共黨在該省附近之軍隊，據傳已具有「師」之實力。龍雲若同意返滇，則其個人之號召力量，可能有助於使中國西南國民政府之後方，不致立卽崩潰，否則將封閉經由滇越鐵路之一切供應路綫。</p>
<h3 id="c18">烽火邊緣的武漢 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>〔本報漢口十日電〕戰爭逼近武漢，今天硬性的新聞已經不能襯托這沉重的情景，下面想以一點一滴的資料，描摩一些「烽火邊緣的武漢」。</p>
<p>大概是沉悶太久了吧，人們對於這個危疑的現實，好像沒有把它看成「暴風雨前夕」了，儘管有的是麻痺，有的是敏感，然而一般說來人心還是顯得分外的鎭靜。</p>
<p>平漢路正面防綫一再縮短，似乎還沒有人十分警惕，等到自南而北的兵馬跨過市街，踏往郊區，鑽進壕防堤壘，大家才瞪限迎送多少感到一些一車轔轔馬蕭蕭」的惡朱。</p>
<p>「走吧，武漢可能要糜爛呀！」一部分華貴自私的人和一部分憧憬安全的人都懷着這樣的心情，於是粵漢碼頭人羣擁擠，行李堆積如山，而登記滬漢班機的乘客也超過一千五百人，最引人注意的還是幾　紗廠老　的遠飛。</p>
<p>就在這　忙亂的當中，昨天下午二時，徐家棚碼頭的工人把搬運的炸彈弄掉了一顆，炸斃搬伕行人共七個，傷了十多個，幸而這裏不是旅客　集之地，還沒有釀成更大的慘</p>
<p>「走甚麼！走到那裏去？」儘管有少數人在慌忙，但多數人還是很沉着的，特別是剛剛開幕的武昌市參議會大會，正在從長檢討大局，耿伯釗先生說：「我們要喊和平，那個不和平就打倒那個！」他們自始至終，好像認為戰爭不會侵襲武漢，和平一定可可以共享。</p>
<p>看看公務機關的應變情形，也一樣有些微妙，省市兩政府固然已有應變凖備，而若干公營事業機構的態度郤有點參差不齊，第三區電信管理局已開始分組遷移長沙和南昌，而武漢電信局的員工郤正在採購食米，決心「堅守到底」！</p>
<p>市場呢，無論紗市布市乃至米市，都形成普遍的冷落，除了升斤尺寸的交易外，已經沒有大量的囤購，只是銀元大漲，公敎人員與職業工人都起了嚴重的恐慌。</p>
<p>最刺人心弦的，市面上發現了神密的傳單和警吿，治安當局已出動大批警員偵捕奸宄分子，加上過境駐軍移動頻繁，漢市勞軍運動正積極展開，而目黃陂撤來的電訊人員又擠在武漢電訊局門口，妻啼子號，扮演得分外緊張凄凉。</p>
<p>所有這一切，不是象徵戰禍無法避免嗎？但歌台戲院家家客滿，地下舞廳「篷拆」不休，又有誰能相信這裏已經面臨戰火邊緣呢？</p>

<h3 id="c20">外交攻勢能停止冷戰嗎？ <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>大西洋公約在華府簽字成立後，國際形勢急轉直下：一方面是東西兩方的「冷戰」益趨劇烈，蘇聯及其「鐵幕」以內的各國，莫不譴責大西洋公約將製造新的國際戰爭，並公然指斥美國為「戰爭販子」，這種反美宜傳戰可謂達於頂點；此在美國方面亦不甘示弱，則由杜魯門總統向世界各國警告，率直地說：「為謀人類福利與世界和平計，美將不惜再度使用原子彈」。另一方面是西歐各國的重整軍備益形具體化，西歐八國向美國作緊急呼籲，要求美國予以軍事的經濟的援助，美國當局已予以正面答覆，並謂軍事援助歐的計劃正在草擬中，全部所需美元當在十五億以上，這一切的一切，無一不足以顯示出國際局勢的嚴重，今日的世界走向戰爭之路，確實一天近似一天了，無論站在那一個角度去觀察這個趨向，總是人類的一大不幸。</p>
<p>我們觀察美國外交政策最近的動向，不難看出美國外交活動的心仍在西歐，並不因邱吉爾的警告（謂中國的崩潰是第二次大戰勝利後的一大悲劇）而有所轉移；而且美國務院早已擬好一連串的計劃。大西洋公約的簽字是美國外交攻勢的第一步，繼之而起的，還有許多計劃的步驟，據我們已經看至的，有下列兩項·第一是扶德政策的加緊推行，所謂西德協定也已在華府簽字成立，其要點有四：（一）統一英美佔領區與法國佔領區的管制，並逐漸取消英美法三國佔領區的疆界；（二）在今後的六十天內建立西德政府；（三）劃一英美法三國佔領軍的軍事任務；（四）承認西德亦為大西水瓶公約簽約國之一。第二是協助西歐各國重整軍備，英，法，比，荷，盧五國的國防部長在海牙開會，通過了一項防禦西歐的軍事計劃，並決定採取如何實現引項軍事計劃的方法；但是西歐各國重整軍備最困難之處，乃在各國的創痛尚未恢復，經濟的困難最感棘手，如果不能獲得美國的援助，則此項軍事計劃能否實現，也是一個極大的疑題，因此西歐各國乃向美國作緊急的呼籲，美國已有慷慨解襄的表示，全部經費尚在十五億美元以上。此外，第二年的援歐法案，即撥款五十八億美元，用以援助西歐各國復興經濟，也將完成立法程序，可望於日內成立了。</p>
<p>從美國對西歐各國的計劃看來，縝密而遠大；再賴其「無比」的資本——美元，當可望立於不敗之地，使東方不免有「本形見絀」之感。但是美國採取這一套的外交攻勢，在東西兩方的「冷戰」中，能否擊敗對方，迫令其要求停止「冷戰」，恐怕還是一個不能解答的問題。美國務卿艾契遜八日對合衆社記者談稱：「最近西方盟國的勇敢行動，已加強對蘇冷戰和平解決的機會，美國將竭誠支持英美法三國的決議，拒絕與蘇聯再度進行談判，直到蘇聞解除對柏林的封鎖為止」。由此可知，在艾契遜國務卿的心目中，滿以為美國只要能以強硬的手段對付蘇聯，就能迫令蘇聯就範，所以他對於美蘇冷戰的前途，抱着非常樂觀的態度，並堅持西方盟國一貫的立場，就是要以蘇聯先行解除柏林封鎖為重開談判的先決條件。在艾契遜本人而言，他抱着這種自信，或許另有其理由；但由於我們看來，由大西洋公約而西德協定，由馬歇爾計劃而援歐重整軍備，雖能說明美國對歐政策的積極，決以實力來填滿歐洲的軟弱真空地帶；但其後果，仍恐不能達成的迫令蘇聯就範要求停止冷戰的目的。甚至要招致相反的後果，使冷戰的發展恐將有增無減。不僅德國的永久分裂，不復有重歸統一的希望；而且西歐各國的重整軍備，也將使各國人民都深深感到「大炮先二牛油」的痛苦。</p>
<p>上述的分析，我們並沒有向興高采烈的西方盟國的外交家澆冷水的意向，更沒有反對西方盟國的任何潛意識，而是要西方盟國的政治外交家觀察大下大勢，必須從整個的世界權衡得失。今日冷戰的範圍，並不限於歐洲，西方盟國如只知在歐洲下工夫，以實力來填補「真空地帶」；而漢視了別處的「真空地帶」，即使在歐洲無往而不利，但仍不能獲得具有決定性的結果的。邱吉爾說：「權衡冷戰的得失，應以歐亞兩洲同時合計」。這名言，是最值得今日西方盟國政治外交家深切反省的。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓九日電〕起草該案小組會主席衆議員馬洪向撥款委會提出之報吿中，有由於世界局勢之險象環生，吾人除犧牲以外，別無他途可循等語。預算案中規定美國軍隊共有官兵四百七十四萬三千一百名，其中正規軍一百六十四萬四千二百人，國衛隊卅九萬九千五百人，有組織的後備部隊二百七十萬九千三百人。在正規軍中陸軍有六十七萬七千人，海軍佔五十二萬七千三百人，（內陸戰隊八萬五千七百名）空軍佔四十四萬人。預算案中並列有國家安全資源委員會經費三百七十萬元，及退伍軍人養老金支出一億八千九百萬元，研究及發展費五億三千萬元。預算中增加最多者為空軍部份購置新機及訓練新機機員之費用，計現款二億零九百萬元及預訂購買合同金額六億四千二百萬元。海軍部份的預算規定共有艦艇七百卅一艘，包括主力艦「密蘇里」號，重航空母艦八艘，護航用輕航空母艦十一艘，巡洋艦十八艘，驅逐艦及護航驅逐艦一百七十艘，潛艇八十艘，魚雷艦及巡邏艇九十九艘，兩棲艇八十四艘，輔佐船舶二百六十艘。又造價總額一億八千九百萬元之超級航空母艦「合衆國」號，其迭價中之四千三百萬元亦列入下年度預算內，海軍發言人告撥款委會，相信美海軍可在世界任何部份迅速行動，惟海長蘇利文則對海軍航空隊之僅能在下年添購新機八百四十三架，猶表不滿，渠特別指出某一外國現有潛艇二百五十艘以上。</p>
<p>戰爭目前不致爆發</p>
<p>撥款委會於辯論該案時，陸軍參謀長勃雷特萊吿該會稱，預料在至一九五〇年六月卅日為止之一年內，不致有戰爭發生，去年渠較今日更為耽心，但渠並未詳細加以釋明。陸軍副參長魏德邁稱，渠並不認為戰爭將立卽發生，但亦承認偶發的意外事件可能發生，其發展可能引至參戰。」空軍部長薛明頓表示可能的侵略者在一九五二年以前不致有原子彈，故戰爭目前尙不致爆發。空軍副參長克雷謂，蘇聯自德國原子科學家所獲得的知識，美國完全知道。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十日廣播，柏林訊：今日西德三國駐軍當局以上星期五公佈之新佔領法規，交與波恩議會，該法規並由美國之克萊·英國之羅柏遜·法國之柯寗三總督簽署。三國當局並聲明下列各點：西德政府有全部立法·行政·司法之權。（二）西方國家仍保留政府九個部門之管理權，此九個部門為。外交·解除武裝·魯爾區之管現·流亡人民之處理·盟國之安全·國外貿易·德俘·聯合國之經濟援助·敎育。</p>
<p>（三）德國違反佔領原則之各項立法，三國有否決權。（四）佔領軍當局深盼在上述九部門之外，無須再作其他干涉。（五）佔領國於接受本國訓令時，得於必要時採取若干措施，以維持德國之民主制度。（六）佔領國於遝用前條所述之權力前，將通知西德政府，並說明採取此項措施之理由。（七）西德政府無權廢止佔領法規。（八）一年之後，十八個月之內，佔領國將對佔領法規再作審核，並決定是否應予德政府以較大之權限。</p>
<p>予德自治機會具半和約性質</p>
<p>〔聯合社波恩十日電〕美英法三國所訂立之佔領法規，具有半和約性質，全文約七百字，一俟德國成立聯邦共和國卽可生效，其日期大約在七月一日左右。規約內容給與西德四千五百萬人民以自治機會。</p>
<p>根據三國協定西德重草憲法</p>
<p>〔路透社波恩九日電〕波恩議會鑒於前此所草之憲法未獲盟國批准，及因華盛頓協定而產生的新局勢，已草擬西德臨時性的憲法，俾得為德政府及議會開始工作之最低度法律基礎。制憲議會中之德社會民主黨領袖認為三强協定旣給予德國以獲得獨立政府及參加歐洲集團的機會，德國自不宜輕易放棄。盟國如堅持財政權應由聯邦諸邦個別掌握而不應集中聯邦當局，德國方面縱認為不合實際，亦祇得一試。惟社民黨亦聲明彼等之作此讓步，並非出於自願，實因由於盟國之干涉，乃使西德新憲不復能具民主憲法的性質，而僅成行政上的一種管理法則。</p>

<p>艾氏設，大西洋公約非為西方國家第一次的行動，先是巳有被歐洲各戰災國家熱烈歡迎的馬歇爾援助協定，東歐國家原擬參加該協定，然在略事躊躇之際，蘇聯卽予阻止。我們並不放棄團結世界的希望，但必須由共黨放棄他們迫使世界接受其主義，及迫使每一個人穿上列寗馬克斯主義的緊身衣之企圖，始能使世界趨於團結。我們相信人類精神應有自由，這是不列　社會主義的信條。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕梁北和興其妻陳月齊，均係加拿大華僑，於一九三三年七月二十九日，經人介紹在加溫高華埠結婚。同年九月梁返國後，在本市行醫，並於同年年底接陳返國同居。詎陳習於洋北，對祖　國生活，頗感不慣，數度要求其夫同行出國居住，梁未之許，感情由是破裂，陳乃數次要求離婚，以便單獨出國居住，梁多方勸阻，勉強在滬居住數年。至一九四〇年秋，太平洋戰事發生前夕，陳又要求其夫出國同居，經梁毅然拒絕，陳卽獨單購買船票退回，惟陳旋又購得日本皇後號輪票，不告而去，待梁獲悉時，已不及阻止。嗣後陳音訊查然，生死不明，經梁多方託友至加拿大尋訪，均無踪跡。梁乃於上月具狀地院，請求判令興陳離婚，頃經判決，准予離異。</p>

<p>市總工會常德路新廈，昨上午十時舉行奠基典禮。到該會全體常務理監，各業工會理事長。來賓到有農工部陸京士副部長，工務局趙祖　康局長，社會局曹沛滋局長（陸蘊初代）等計二百餘人。由周學湘主持報告，該會原在南市蓬萊路二六七號，因房屋簡陋，諸感不便，且本市為國際人舊集之都市，該會又為全市勞工代表，乃由上屆理事長水祥雲，本屆理事長周學湘及全體理監事之策劃，又蒙中央農工部陸副部長之支助，並號召全市工人一致響應，籌建工作乃得積極進行。卅六年十一月第三次會員代表大會決議，各業工友踴躍捐輸一日所得工資，於是基金始有着落。此款收集後卽全部購辦材料，再蒙上海市社會福利事業委員會撥贈勞工醫院剩餘材料，及吳市長撥助金圓二千萬元，頗資補助。並流動資金拆放生息，故建築工資之支付俾以保持原有幣值。最後又稱：該會所今之得以順利興建，實賴本市各界首長各工會負責人各業工友指導協助捐輸，五六兩屆全體理監事熱忱贊助，卒得與工建築。現已舉行奠基再經三數日，將觀厥成矣。常務監事葉翔舉報告籌建經過後，由陸副部長京士，趙局長祖康，曹局長沛滋（陸蘊初代）等相繼致詞。末由常務監事水祥雲致答詞，略謂：總工會發動建築新會所，已歷年餘。過去只聽樓梯響，不見人下樓。現在材料齊全了，基石奠定了，可以把一般人的懷疑，從此打消。這一建築不僅為全上海工人之家，且將促進全國各地工會這廈之興建。一個工會有了巍峨大廈，以後社會地位無形中可以提高，在國際觀瞻上亦可襯托出我國工運之進步，更可看得出工人團結的力量，在這方面可看得工人的精神來。照目前的估計，大禮堂的完成。材料還感不敷（約需四千石米），希望全市工友繼績努力，完成大禮堂的工程。一個和尚是四萬工人是有偉大的國量的，不像和尚那樣的四大皆空，只要大定一鼓作氣拿出力量來，目的是會達到的，大禮堂是會完成的。繼卽舉行奠基儀式，攝影後禮成散會。</p>
<h3 id="c66">生活指數和物價脫節的結癓所在　品類中包括不少冷門貨上漲比較和緩　每法月中分四次調查物價須平均計算 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕假使我說：「生活指數是十分科學的，十分凖確的」，一定有千千萬萬拿「生活指數」度日的薪水階級，一人個都會瞪着眼睛，不以為然的了！擺在眼前鐵一般的事實，全市一百卅萬薪水階級親身體騐到「生活指數」從來沒有追到過現實的物價。用這樣的指數來計薪是不是合理？當然不言而喻，然而其咎卻不在指數本身。</p>
<p>有人要問：生活指數既然是依據物價編製的，那末何以會與物價倍數脫節得那麼遠呢？這個問題得分二方面來回答。第一：生活指數根本就不是物部數，它包括着許多「冷門貨」，「冷門貨」上漲的速度極慢，指數上漲倍數受到通扯平均後，自不及一般物價倍數了。第二：生活指數雖然因為包括了許多上漲速率比較緩慢的「冷門貨」，然而與物價上漲倍數，究竟不會脫節得那樣遠，故其中癓結所在，自必別有緣由。此話怎講？我們受習慣上的影響，每提到「生活指數」四個字，會很自然地想到每月十五與月底，市政府發表的東西，實際上每月月中月底市府所發表的並不是真正的生活指數，而是半個月中的四個生活指數的平均數，因為每一次物價調查，就有一個生活指數產生，這個指數確是調查物價那一天與其「基期」生活費的比較數字，可是把半個月中的四個指數相加起來除四，產生出來的那個「平均指數」，這就難怪要和物價脫節了，所以說生活指數和物價脫節的原因，雖然不止一端，但是最大的癓結，就是在「平均指數上」。</p>
<p>物價愈漲差額愈大</p>
<p>法幣時代，我們常聽到「×月漲風」一句話，那時候物價是間歇性週期性的上漲，例如五月漲風過後，六月七月的物價就比較穩定，所以「平均指數」本差就不會太大。現在可不午了，你看那一天物價不在上漲，根據最近幾個月來物價上漲的軌跡，差不多每樣貨物每天上漲一成左右，且不管這是政府的財政政策，或是通貨惡性膨脹的必然結果，總之這樣有秩序的天在漲，使生活指數與平均指數的差額越來越大了。舉個簡單的例來說：本月四日的白粳每擔是十八萬元，比去年「八一九」高出九千倍，本月八日的白粳每石二十二萬，比「八一九」高出一萬一千倍，平均之後為一萬倍，假使二十元的底薪，（在去年八月十九日能買一石米），在本月四日給他九千倍，乘底薪可得薪水十八萬元，還是能買到一石米，本月九日給他一萬一千倍，乘底薪可得薪水二十二萬元，也能買到一石米，可是給他平均數的一萬倍來乘底薪那就衹有二十萬元了，二十萬元在本月九日已衹能買九斗米了。</p>
<p>編製指數計算公式</p>
<p>生活指數不應該是個謎，它是神聖的科學產品，沒有人可以操縱它，任何人都可以依着一定的公式自行編造計算。他的計算方式，就是把下列各項貨品數量的現行價格一一查出，相加起來，作為被除數，再以去年八月十九日限價時期的價格相加起來，作為除數，所得的商，便是你採用物價那天的生活指數了。現行指數是根據民國卅年公共租界工部局所舉辦的工人家計調查，計四類，五十四品而來：</p>

<p>發薪方式要求種種</p>
<p>至於薪水趕不上物價，其他原因也不少，如發薪的日期，也是一個比較嚴重問題，例如卅一日發表了指數，到下月四日才發薪，這四天中假定物價上漲四成，那末你領到的薪水，又被打了個六折。因此，總工會正式高喊週薪制，甚至要求天天發薪，也有主張實物計薪，或銀元計薪，花樣也就不一而足了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕龍頭參志超之甲組足球第二循環賽，龍頭在大風中，經過九十分鈡之苦戰，以二比一險勝志超。龍頭操縱全局，自始至終，採取攻勢，但不得其門而入，上半時完畢前五分鐘，鄭秉彝在禁區犯規，被罰十二碼球，錢元慶一射而中，龍頭竟先失一球。下半時龍頭在順風中繼績猛攻，苦無射門脚頭，志超全軍逆風退守，吳祺祥統率三軍，背門力戰，守門盛彼得忙得不亦樂乎。卒於三十分鐘內，攻入兩球，反敗為勝。第二球後衛乘風勢一脚，陳勤一撥竟吹入網內。春風況厲，陰寒欲雨，逸園觀衆寥落，不滿二千人，比賽呈混亂狀態，龍頭脚頭雖硬，踢出算數，接應聯絡俱差，否則早獲大勝。志超小將功夫不夠，吳祺祥獨木難支大廈也。</p>
<p>龍頭先攻，史大法一射出界，姜琨廿碼處對門力射，夏樹福一頭撞去，差之毫厘。志超反攻，徐國平十五碼處反身刁射，閻承寬接住。龍頭再度進襲，又為盛彼得接住。龍頭攻勢猛烈，但未能奏功。吳祺祥帶球遠出，關永常深入勾中，閻承寬躍起接球，被吳哲民撞倒，被判罰出。僵持四十分鐘，龍頭厄運來臨，鄭秉彝在禁區手觸皮球，錢元慶重罰十二碼，射中紅心，一對零先陷一城。五分鐘後上半時告終。</p>
<p>兩車再戰，龍頭諸將，誓復失地，拼命進攻。志超腹地，備受蹂躪。奈前鋒缺乏臨門一脚之工夫，屢次不久。頭龍殺得性起，中後衛開出助戰，鄭秉彝大脚吊向門前，球着地彈起，盛彼得躍起，球已入網。扳成和局。超銳氣消，王步榮得意再來，塞入中路，陳勤近門撥入，二對一後來居上，銀角長鳴，龍頭以二比一倖勝。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據上海電力公司統計，該公司近月來供應本市普通住戶燈熱用電數字如下：去年十一月份燈電一千零七十八萬餘度，熱電一百三十四萬餘度。十二月份燈電一千一百九十四萬餘度，熱電一百五十萬餘度。本年一月份燈電一千三百十五萬餘度，熱電一百六十五萬餘度。二月份燈電一千三百十五萬餘芳，熱電一百五十五萬餘度，三月份尚未結出，大約較二月份為多。此項數字顯示雖電費已接基數機動調整，但對於一般住戶並發生節約之效果，反之燈熱用電衹有增加。又該公司供應之工業用電去去十一月為三千八萬餘度，十二月份為四千三百萬餘度。本年一月份為四千六百萬餘度，二月份因有舊暦新年假期較多，為四千一百萬餘度，三月份五千餘萬度。顯示本市工業有電之需要月有增加，故一般人以為本市工業萎縮之說，似並不確實。又目前本市駐紥部隊甚多，使用燈熱電大都均不付款，電力公司此項損失約為全部收入百分之一云。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Acting President Li Receives Telegram: CCP Orders to Cease Offensive; Frontline Troops to Receive Orders Within One or Two Days; Stance on War Criminals Issue Also Relaxed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The CCP authorities have issued an order on the 10th to cease military offensives. This was clarified in a telegram Acting President Li received from Beiping at 10 p.m. on the 10th. It is reported that this order was issued by the CCP authorities on the 10th, but it will take one or two days to reach the various frontline troops. It is predicted that the continuation of the war can come to an end in the short term. This is the greatest achievement after the delegation's arrival in Beiping for the exchange of views.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Regarding the eight conditions for peace talks proposed by the CCP, the first condition, the issue of war criminals, has seen positive progress during individual contacts before the formal start of the peace talks. The CCP has agreed to relax the handling standards, so the issue of war criminals is no longer the focus of attention. Formal peace talks have not yet begun on the 10th, but according to reports from Beiping, the most important thing at present is the pre-meeting exchange of views. During this period, the eight conditions will be discussed one by one. After each condition has been agreed upon, a formal meeting will be held, and the results of the agreed-upon conditions can be signed into a peace treaty after the start of the meeting. Judging from the current situation, the peace talks may proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Regarding the issue of troop reorganization in the peace talks, government military officials are continuing discussions. At 4 p.m. on the 10th, Acting President Li and Premier He convened a meeting at the Ministry of National Defense with Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Bai Chongxi, Hu Zongnan, Lin Wei, Guo Chan, and others, totaling ten people, for about two hours.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The government's decision to send high-ranking officials to Beiping to assist in the peace talks has not yet been finalized as of the 10th and is still under consideration.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The Peace Talks Guidance Committee established by the KMT Central Standing Committee will have a significant impact on peace talk decisions in the future. The committee consists of eleven members, chaired by Li Zongren. Except for Sun Ke in Guangzhou, the remaining members, including Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, He Yingqin, Tong Guanxian, Zhang Qun, Wu Zhongxin, Zhu Jiahua, and Xu Yongchang, are all in Nanjing. Wu Tiecheng flew from Guangzhou to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 10th and will arrive in Nanjing at 7 a.m. on the 11th. In fact, the above-mentioned eleven committee members had already participated in the deliberation and decision-making of the peace talks in the past. After the Central Standing Committee approved the establishment of the committee, it will follow the instructions of the Central Standing Committee, regularly study and handle all issues in the peace talks, so as to expedite matters. It is reported that the committee does not necessarily hold regular meetings. When important issues arise, all or part of the committee members will consult with each other at any time to resolve them.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Government officials, after thoroughly discussing Mao Zedong's reply telegram to Acting President Li all night on the 9th, have intensified hopes for peace. A senior official commented on the concessions made by the CCP and the mild language in Mao Zedong's reply telegram, saying: This may be the CCP's "first step in a miracle of finally changing its original intention and deciding to make the Beiping negotiations a success." He said that the CCP's abandonment of the demand for an immediate crossing of the Yangtze River and the government's obligation to state its final position before April 12 has brought the KMT and the CCP somewhat closer. He said that there were two particularly encouraging points in Mao Zedong's reply telegram: first, the CCP has now agreed to limit its demands to the scope of the eight conditions; second, the CCP may concede on the deadlock over the issue of punishing war criminals. It is reported that the government's current position on the "punishment of war criminals" is only to agree to prohibit individuals listed as "war criminals" from participating in the coalition government after a peaceful resolution.</p>
<h3 id="e2">KMT Legislative Members in Nanjing to Issue Joint Declaration; Held Secret Symposium Yesterday to Discuss the Current Situation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] KMT legislative members in Nanjing held a secret symposium at 9 a.m. on the 10th at Shipo Lane to discuss party affairs reform and the current situation. More than 80 people attended, including Huang Yuren, Fan Yushui, Gan Jiaxin, Huang Tong, Qiu Changwei, Wang Qijiang, Bai Yu, Liu Butong, and Wu Hexuan. Chairman Bao Huaguo and other committee members spoke enthusiastically, exchanging opinions extensively on peace talks, party affairs reform, and the current situation. It was decided to issue a joint declaration on the current situation, stating: (1) absolute support for peace talks; (2) hope that the Executive Yuan will truly be accountable to the Legislative Yuan; (3) overthrow the powerful families, politically abolish monopoly; and (4) oppose behind-the-scenes manipulation. Huang Yuren, Bao Huaguo, Wang Menglin, and Gan Jiaxin were nominated to be responsible for drafting the declaration. In addition, it was decided to establish a joint organization, and Tu Gongshui, Qiu Changwei, Zhang Jingyu, Zou Shuwen, Chen Guyuan, and others were nominated to draft the organizational regulations, which will be submitted for discussion at the next meeting. The symposium on the 10th was initiated by Huang Yuren, Gan Jiaxin, Qiu Changwei, Huang Tong, and Fan Yushui. Those invited were mostly KMT legislators with similar views. Two meetings had been held in the past, and the 10th was the third gathering. At the meeting, Qiu Changwei first reported on the peace talks, saying that the peace talks were progressing smoothly, the issue of war criminals was expected to ease, and the Communist army would certainly not cross the Yangtze River during the peace talks. Third-party figures are now mediating, and the CCP hopes that government officials will visit Beiping. He believed that the future could be optimistic, but regardless of the success or failure of the peace talks, it was difficult to say whether the Communist army would eventually cross the river. Huang Yuren then reported on his views on party affairs reform. The committee members spoke one after another, lamenting the mistakes of party affairs in the past, saying that without thorough reform, it would be impossible to save the critical situation. The meeting adjourned at 12 noon.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, Sweden, 9th Dispatch] Fu Bingchang, Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union, who arrived here on the 9th from Moscow via Helsinki, reiterated here that although he is on his way back to the country, it has not yet been decided whether to serve as foreign minister. He said: "Nanjing has not formally asked me whether I would accept the post of foreign minister. I would like to study the domestic political situation before Yuno takes office as foreign minister."</p>
<h3 id="e4">Cheng Qian Issues Statement to Stop Absurd Rumors <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Gongshang Bao Permanently Suspended</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Bureau, 10th Dispatch] In order to clarify public opinion and stop rumors, Hunan Chairman Cheng Qian issued a written statement of more than a thousand words on the 10th. The summary is as follows:</p>
<p>"Recently, the peace talks are underway. Except for a very small number of people, I believe that most people must hope for its smooth success. At present, the total number of troops and local teams on both sides is more than 20 million. Driving them into meaningless struggles will not only fail to produce anything, but both sides will also consume manpower and resources. If the fighting continues, the human race will also be destroyed. Thinking of this, anyone with a little conscience will be heartbroken. Therefore, everyone hopes for peace very much. As for my being listed as one of the war criminals, I will not defend myself and am willing to accept the public trial of the people. If I am truly found to have committed war crimes, I will not hesitate to be torn to pieces. Hunan is the Hunan of 30 million people. I do not recognize that a small number of people can consider themselves masters and control the fate of the majority of the people, and I oppose those who are partial and selfish and disregard the lives of the public and sell out Hunan. With a sincere and upright determination, I seek to save Hunan from the scourge of war, the people from the fire of artillery, social order to be stabilized, and local vitality to be preserved. I hope that at this critical juncture, everyone will work together to satisfy this one requirement: Changsha is the nerve center of local administration. It is necessary to maintain stability, not to alarm each other, and especially not to believe rumors. All opportunistic and self-righteous remarks will not help the actual situation. Finally, Cheng warned "no more creating new ideas and disrupting the process, no more digging one's own grave and causing suffering to the people."</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The local Gongshang Bao published "Chairman Song (Cheng Qian) is willing to be Fu Zuoyi," and on April 7, students marched and shouted "Demand to be like Beiping," with all kinds of absurd arguments, causing unrest in people's hearts. In addition to issuing a written statement, Cheng Qian also ordered the Gongshang Bao to be permanently suspended for its absurd remarks.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Amidst Reports of CCP Ceasing Offensive, Artillery Battles Still Fierce North of Yangtze; Some Stray Shells Heard in Capital, Injuring People in Longtan; CCP Attempt to Cross Yangtze Southward Foiled in Anqing <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Several faint sounds of artillery fire were heard in the capital after dusk on the 10th, clearer in Xiaguan and the northern part of the city. This was the first time the capital had heard the sound of artillery fire since the war moved southward. However, the artillery fire was from the National Army, not the Communist Army. It is reported that around 7 li southwest of Jiangpu, a village was raided by a thousand Communist soldiers in the afternoon of the 10th, and a battle occurred with the defending troops. The National Army artillery north of the Yangtze River was ordered to fire in support around dusk, so the sound of artillery fire intermittently reached the south bank. The battle in that area continued until late at night, with no changes in the positions.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Military sources here claim that when the Communist army captured Dahekou, located on the opposite side of Longtan in the northwest direction, on the evening of the 8th, they fired artillery shells at the south bank. One shell landed in Longtan, which is about 8 li from Longtan Station, injuring nine people. Foreign wire reports that the shell landed at the station are inaccurate. Also, during this attack on Yiwei, 80% of the Communist artillerymen in Dahekou and Sanjiangying were Japanese.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Elite troops of the National Army continued to arrive at Shierxu on the 10th, stabilizing the situation. The Communist 16th Army's Zhang Juchu division, with more than 10,000 soldiers, is now attacking in an encircling posture, but the area remains safe. Also, a captured Communist soldier from the Yizheng battle said that the 25th Army of the Communist Army is still located in Longheji, west of Yangzhou and south of Yizheng. The 24th Army has recently arrived in the suburbs of Yangzhou, seemingly as a follow-up force for an active southward advance.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The Communist army attacking Liuxu continued to increase on the 10th and moved southward in an arc from the east, west, and north. On the morning of the 9th, the vanguard troops had reached the vicinity of Chenjiaqiao, 4 li from Liuxu. After reinforcements from the National Army arrived this morning, they continuously fired artillery at the area, and the Communist army retreated north to Chenjiaqiao. The defending troops moved into the bridge.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] According to the Military News Agency: (1) The Communist army that captured Dahekou continued to attack Huashikou at 10 p.m. on the 9th, and the defending troops are resisting. (2) Gaoqiao Town, south of Sanjiangying, across the river from Dagang, was captured by the Communist army at 6 p.m. on the 9th, and the National Army retreated to Jingkou Ferry. (3) Nengwo is still firmly defended by the National Army. (4) Fierce fighting took place in Longshaogang, southeast of the port, starting at 8 p.m. on the 9th. (5) A small part of the Liangshan position on the opposite bank of Wuhu was captured by the Communist army on the morning of the 10th, and the National Army is counterattacking. (6) The Communist army in Huayang, upstream of Anqing, began shelling the south bank on the evening of the 8th, which did not stop all night. On the morning of the 9th, the Communist army crossed the river southward by boat, and more than ten boats were sunk by the National Army, and the remaining boats were scattered. The Communist army shelled the south bank all day on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 10th Dispatch] The Communist army attacked the National Army's position at Longwokou north of the Yangtze River on the 9th, and the battle was fierce. By dawn on the 10th, the Communist army had charged several times, with corpses lying all over the field. They suffered more than 5,000 casualties but ultimately failed. The Communist army's offensive at Longshaogang once stalled on the 9th, but resumed its fierce attack on the position at night, and the offensive eased by the morning of the 10th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Military news: The battle in the areas of Liangshan Yuxikou and Erba on the opposite bank of Wuhu continued. The Communist army launched another fierce attack at 8 p.m. on the 9th, and a small part of the Xiliangshan position was captured by the morning of the 10th. The National Army is fighting bravely in a counterattack.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Officials today announced that the National Army has abandoned Hekou and Yaojiaji under the pressure of the Communist army's Lin Biao's forces and is withdrawing to Changxuanling, 36 miles north of Hankou. Another unit of the Communist army occupied Xishui, 55 miles east of Hankou. The National Army also abandoned Huangmei, 30 miles north of Jiujiang, and retreated towards Jiujiang. The National Army bridgehead on the opposite bank of Wuhu is currently under heavy attack by the Communist army.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Communist Army is Flowing Southward, Vowing to Liberate the Entire Country <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The CCP has not yet stopped its propaganda offensive. In yesterday's news broadcast on CCP radio, it continued to attack the government and admitted that the Northeast and North China Communist armies are marching south along railways, highways, roads, and waterways to "liberate" the area south of the Yangtze River. On the North China Plain, large armies are continuously flowing south, and recruitment campaigns are being expanded everywhere. The radio station also claimed that three field armies of the Communist army are in line with the CCP's eight peace conditions, realizing true peace and liberating Jiangnan. The Central Plains People's Liberation Army and the East China People's Liberation Army have now been reorganized into the Second and Third Field Armies, and most of them have gathered on the north bank of the Yangtze River. The Fourth Field Army, reorganized from the Northeast Liberation Army, is flowing south in a steady stream. According to the broadcast, the National Army deployed in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River numbers about 300,000, and about 200,000 are distributed in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The total number is less than all the National Army in the Huaihai Campaign, and their morale is said to be far inferior to that of the Communist Army. In order to liberate the entire China, all railways, highways, and country roads north of the Yangtze River are being repaired. From the Yalu River to the Yangtze River, food and laborers are flowing south with the Communist army. The river channels along the Yangtze River have also been dredged, and tens of thousands of ships are waiting, ready to cross the river. At the same time, the people south of the Yangtze River will also take action to welcome the Communist army. The first detachment of the CCP's southward work team, with 2,600 members in four brigades, held an opening ceremony in Zhongshan Park, Beiping on the 8th. Lin Biao and Luo Ronghuan attended and delivered speeches. Lin Biao said that the Communist army has won a decisive victory, and the future task is to realize true democratic peace in the whole of China in accordance with the CCP's eight conditions.</p>

The Communist army is actively transporting grain and ammunition between Huangzhai and Xihuangshui north of the city. Four artillery pieces towed by Communist army cars were found near Xihuangshui. The Jin-Chahar-Hebei Communist Army is also forcibly conscripting laborers in various counties. Currently, more than 2,000 people have been gathered in Mingli Wusu and other places in Yuci, and the Fen River Bridge is being reinforced in Xiaodian Jiajie south of the city. The National Army is closely monitoring the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Whether Long Yun Will Return to Yunnan is Undecided; His Son Says There are Three Prerequisites: Resolve Economic Issues, Establish Yunnan Army <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Yang Wenqing, a committee member of the Yunnan Provincial Committee, who was previously the representative of Chairman Lu to pay his respects to Acting President Li in Nanjing to discuss various issues related to the Yunnan territory and was ordered to visit former Chairman Long in Hong Kong, returned to Kunming at noon on the 10th after completing his mission. According to him, Long Yun is in good health in Hong Kong, and the various rumors are not credible. Long has no intention of returning to Yunnan for the time being. Yang told reporters that this trip was quite satisfactory, and he is scheduled to visit Chairman Lu on the 11th to report on the progress.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 10th Dispatch] Long Yun's eldest son, Long Shengwu, said that his father has not yet made a decision on Acting President Li's invitation to reassume the chairmanship of Yunnan. There are three prerequisites for his father to accept Acting President Li's invitation: (1) Yunnan should adopt a stable currency; (2) there should be a balanced economy so that Yunnan can meet its own needs without the need for Nanjing's assistance; and (3) a Yunnan army should be established. Long Shengwu confirmed that he had visited Nanjing on behalf of his father, who was unable to go in person due to poor health. He also said that Long Yun's return to Yunnan "may be extremely complicated," and his attitude will depend on the position of the National Government and the public opinion of the people of Yunnan. Well-informed sources said that Long Yun has always been known for his caution in politics, so he is hesitant about Acting President Li's invitation. He naturally hopes to return to his province, but he seems to avoid any action that could arouse the suspicion of the Communists. Communist newspapers here have not published any news hostile to Long Yun so far, perhaps because of his hostile attitude towards President Chiang. The same source believes that Long Yun recently declined a visit to North China but sent a letter to his old friend Li Jishen, chairman of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee now in Beiping, explaining that he could not make the trip due to "poor health." Well-informed sources here deny that Long Yun has a bad relationship with the current Chairman of Yunnan, Lu Han. On the contrary, Lu Han's provincial government retains many of Long Yun's former friends, and Lu often maintains contact with Long Yun. A British businessman here, who had lived in Kunming for several years, recently returned to Hong Kong and said that this statement seemed extremely unreliable, because Long Yun and Lu Han were not only relatives but also belonged to the same unit and were close friends. He believes that the government's actions are due to the frequent rebellions in Yunnan. In the past few weeks, the rebels have occupied more than 20 towns, and the Communist army near the province is rumored to have the strength of a "division." If Long Yun agrees to return to Yunnan, his personal appeal may help prevent the immediate collapse of the National Government's rear in southwest China; otherwise, it will close all supply lines via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Wuhan on the Edge of the Flames of War <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Bureau, 10th Dispatch] As war approaches Wuhan, the hard news today cannot highlight this heavy scene. Below, I would like to use a little bit of information to describe some of "Wuhan on the Edge of the Flames of War."</p>
<p>Perhaps it has been too dull for too long. People do not seem to regard this precarious reality as "the eve of the storm." Although some are numb and some are sensitive, generally speaking, people's hearts are still extraordinarily calm.</p>
<p>The frontal defense line of the Ping-Han Railway has been shortening repeatedly, and it seems that no one is very vigilant. When the soldiers and horses from the south to the north crossed the streets, stepped into the suburbs, and drilled into the trenches and embankments, everyone stared blankly, welcoming and sending them off, and somewhat felt the evil omen of "chariots rumbling and horses neighing."</p>
<p>"Let's go, Wuhan may be devastated!" Some wealthy and selfish people and some who yearn for safety all had this feeling in their hearts. As a result, the wharves of the Yuehan Railway were crowded with people, luggage piled up like mountains, and the number of passengers registering for the Shanghai-Hankou flight exceeded 1,500. The most eye-catching thing was the distant flight of several yarn factory owners.</p>
<p>Amidst this busy chaos, at 2 p.m. yesterday, workers at the Xujiapeng Wharf dropped a bomb they were carrying, killing a total of seven porters and pedestrians and injuring more than ten. Fortunately, this was not a gathering place for tourists and did not cause a greater tragedy.</p>
<p>"What are we running away from! Where are we going?" Although a few people are panicking, most people are still very calm. Especially the newly opened Wuhan Municipal Assembly, which is conducting a lengthy review of the overall situation. Mr. Geng Bozhao said, "We want to shout for peace. Whoever is not for peace, we will overthrow them!" From beginning to end, they seem to believe that the war will not invade Wuhan and that peace can certainly be shared.</p>
<p>Looking at the response of government agencies, it is also somewhat subtle. Although the provincial and municipal governments have made emergency preparations, the attitudes of some public institutions are somewhat uneven. The Third District Telecommunications Administration has begun to move to Changsha and Nanchang in groups, while the employees of the Wuhan Telecommunications Bureau are purchasing rice, determined to "stick to their posts to the end"!</p>
<p>As for the market, whether it is the yarn market, the cloth market, or even the rice market, there is a general sluggishness. In addition to small-scale transactions, there is no large-scale hoarding. Only the price of silver dollars has risen sharply, causing serious panic among public school teachers and workers.</p>
<p>Most heartbreakingly, mysterious leaflets and warnings have appeared on the market, and the security authorities have dispatched a large number of police officers to detect and arrest spies. In addition, the transit garrison troops are moving frequently, the Hankou military conscription campaign is being actively launched, and the telecommunications personnel who have been withdrawn from Huangpi are crowded at the gate of the Wuhan Telecommunications Bureau, with wives weeping and children crying, playing a particularly tense and tragic scene.</p>
<p>Doesn't all of this symbolize that the scourge of war is unavoidable? But every song stage and theater is full, and the underground dance halls are "booming" non-stop. Who can believe that this place is already facing the edge of the flames of war?</p>
<h3 id="e19">One of the Mysterious Guests from Peiping: Liu Ziheng Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Said to Be a Personal Trip, Planning to Stay One Day <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Ziheng, one of the mysterious guests from Peiping to the capital, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping yesterday morning. Mr. Liu appears to be in his forties, wearing an old black cotton robe and a gray felt hat, looking very much like a rural teacher from the mainland, and not at all like a political envoy traveling north and south. Mr. Liu stated that he would only stay in Shanghai for one day, and did not disclose his residence or friends he planned to visit, but repeatedly and solemnly declared, "This trip to Shanghai is entirely a personal action and does not represent any opinion from any party." Mr. Liu also claimed to be from Teng County, Shandong, and arrived in Peiping from a certain place after the liberation of North China.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Can Diplomatic Offensives Stop the Cold War? <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>After the signing of the Atlantic Treaty in Washington, D.C., the international situation took a sharp turn for the worse. On the one hand, the "Cold War" between the East and West became increasingly intense. The Soviet Union and the countries within its "Iron Curtain" all condemned the Atlantic Treaty as creating a new international war and openly denounced the United States as a "war monger." This anti-American propaganda war can be said to have reached its peak. On the American side, they were not to be outdone. President Truman warned the world that "for the sake of human welfare and world peace, the United States will not hesitate to use the atomic bomb again." On the other hand, the rearmament of Western European countries has become increasingly concrete. The eight Western European countries have made an urgent appeal to the United States, requesting military and economic assistance. The U.S. authorities have responded positively, saying that a plan for military assistance to Europe is being drafted, with a total requirement of more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. All of this is enough to show the seriousness of the international situation. The world today is indeed moving closer to the road to war, and no matter from which angle we observe this trend, it is a great misfortune for mankind.</p>
<p>Observing the recent trends in American foreign policy, it is not difficult to see that the focus of American diplomatic activity is still in Western Europe, and it has not shifted due to Churchill's warning (that the collapse of China is a great tragedy after the victory of World War II). Moreover, the U.S. State Department has already drafted a series of plans. The signing of the Atlantic Treaty is the first step in the American diplomatic offensive, followed by many planned steps. According to what we have already seen, there are the following two items: First, the intensified implementation of the pro-German policy. The so-called West German Agreement has also been signed in Washington, D.C., with four key points: (1) Unifying the administration of the British and American occupation zones with the French occupation zone, and gradually abolishing the boundaries of the three occupation zones; (2) Establishing a West German government within the next sixty days; (3) Standardizing the military missions of the British, American, and French occupation forces; (4) Recognizing West Germany as one of the signatories of the Atlantic Treaty. Second, assisting Western European countries in rearming. The defense ministers of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg met in The Hague and passed a military plan to defend Western Europe, and decided on how to implement this military plan. However, the greatest difficulty for Western European countries to rearm is that the wounds of the war have not yet healed, and the economic difficulties are the most troublesome. If they cannot obtain assistance from the United States, whether this military plan can be realized is also a very large question. Therefore, Western European countries have made an urgent appeal to the United States, which has expressed its willingness to provide generous assistance, with a total cost of more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. In addition, the second-year aid to Europe bill, which allocates 5.8 billion U.S. dollars to assist Western European countries in reviving their economies, will also complete the legislative process and is expected to be established within days.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the American plan for Western European countries, it is meticulous and far-sighted. Relying on its "unparalleled" capital—the U.S. dollar—it can be expected to stand in an invincible position, making the East feel a sense of "intrinsic inferiority." However, whether the United States can defeat its opponent in the "Cold War" between the East and West by adopting this set of diplomatic offensives and force it to demand the cessation of the "Cold War" is probably still an unanswerable question. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson told reporters from the Associated Press on the 8th: "The recent courageous actions of the Western Allies have strengthened the opportunity for a peaceful resolution of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The United States will wholeheartedly support the resolution of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and refuse to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union again until the Soviet Union lifts the blockade of Berlin." From this, it can be seen that Secretary of State Acheson believes that as long as the United States can deal with the Soviet Union with strong means, it can force the Soviet Union to submit. Therefore, he is very optimistic about the future of the U.S.-Soviet Cold War and insists on the consistent position of the Western Allies, which is to take the prior lifting of the Berlin blockade by the Soviet Union as a prerequisite for reopening negotiations. As far as Acheson himself is concerned, he may have his own reasons for holding this confidence; but as we see it, from the Atlantic Treaty to the West German Agreement, from the Marshall Plan to the aid to Europe and rearmament, although it can explain the active American policy toward Europe, it is determined to use strength to fill the weak vacuum in Europe; but the consequences may still not achieve the goal of forcing the Soviet Union to submit and demand the cessation of the Cold War. It may even lead to the opposite result, making the development of the Cold War more likely to increase rather than decrease. Not only will the permanent division of Germany not have the hope of reunification, but the rearmament of Western European countries will also make the people of all countries deeply feel the pain of "cannons before butter."</p>
<p>In the above analysis, we do not have the intention of pouring cold water on the elated diplomats of the Western Allies, and we do not have any subconscious opposition to the Western Allies. Rather, we want the political diplomats of the Western Allies to observe the general trend of the world and must weigh the gains and losses from the entire world. Today, the scope of the Cold War is not limited to Europe. If the Western Allies only know how to work hard in Europe to fill the "vacuum zone" with strength, and ignore the "vacuum zone" elsewhere, even if they are always successful in Europe, they still cannot obtain decisive results. Churchill said: "To weigh the gains and losses of the Cold War, both Europe and Asia should be considered together." This famous saying is most worthy of deep reflection by the political diplomats of the Western Allies today.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 10th] The first corps of the Harmony Pre-Cadre Corps was coerced into rebelling by the former commander, Jia Yibin.

Mr. Xu arrived in He on the afternoon of the 8th and came to Hangzhou on the 9th to discuss the recruitment method with the chairman of the bureau. According to Mr. Xu's report to this newspaper reporter, Jia Yibin was dismissed due to ideological problems and returned to incite rebellion out of resentment. The incident was originally scheduled to take place on the 16th, but it was leaked and he hurriedly coerced Commander Li and other troops to go with him. Only the first and second battalions of Jia's cadres and the second battalion were forced to go with him, totaling about 1,800 people. There was also infighting within the corps after the incident, and half of those who escaped back to He have been reorganized by Mr. Xu.

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] After the second year of the Aid to Europe Recovery Act was submitted to the House for discussion today, it has sparked a new movement to increase aid to China, led by Republican Senator Smith, who proposed cutting $500 million from the second phase of the Aid to Europe Act to restore aid to China. Smith said that the Soviet Union is conducting a frantic race to take over Asia without firing a shot. Then the Philippines will be like a sitting duck, and Japan and the Pacific Islands, and even our Alaska, will be in danger. I hope you will not think that this situation can be laughed off. The United States is willing to spend billions of dollars to deal with the threat of communism in Europe, but in China, it insists that the Kuomintang government should reorganize into a coalition government, accommodating the Communist Party in a favorable position to support communism. I now denounce the current policy of the State Department, which is to trade with the Communist Party when the opportunity arises, and is currently taking action to destroy the officials of the Republic of China. I really doubt whether we really want to stop communism. Once China collapses, all of Asia will turn red, and when the door is opened, the Soviet Union can control more than half of the world's population. The Soviet Union should be blocked in Europe, but we cannot risk the communization of Asia and the Pacific Islands. Smith suggested that the ECA's aid to Europe program could be cut by at least $500 million without any harm. Speaker Rayburn predicted that Smith's proposal or any similar proposal would not be submitted for discussion.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] In an atmosphere of overt anti-Soviet sentiment, the House Appropriations Committee passed a bill on the 9th to allocate 15.9091168 billion yuan to the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the fiscal year beginning July 1, setting a new post-war record, an increase of more than 5 billion over the amount previously requested by President Truman. The committee also overturned Truman's opinion and voted to allow the Air Force to form 70 squadrons.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 9th] Congressman Mahon, chairman of the subcommittee drafting the bill, said in a report to the Appropriations Committee that due to the dangerous world situation, we have no choice but to make sacrifices. The budget stipulates that the U.S. military has a total of 4,743,100 officers and soldiers, including 1,644,200 regular troops, 399,500 National Guard troops, and 2,709,300 organized reserve troops. Among the regular troops, the Army has 677,000 troops, the Navy has 527,300 troops (including 85,700 Marines), and the Air Force has 440,000 troops.

In addition, 43 million yuan of the 189 million yuan total cost of the super aircraft carrier "United States" is also included in the next year's budget. A Navy spokesman told the Appropriations Committee that he believes the U.S. Navy can act quickly anywhere in the world, but Navy Secretary Sullivan is still dissatisfied that the Navy Air Corps can only purchase 843 new aircraft in the next year. He specifically pointed out that a certain foreign country currently has more than 250 submarines.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 10th (Broadcast), Berlin: Today, the Allied military authorities of West Germany submitted the new occupation statute, which was announced last Friday, to the Bonn Assembly. The statute was signed by the three governors: Clay of the United States, Robertson of the United Kingdom, and Koenig of France. The three powers also declared the following points: (1) The West German government has full legislative, administrative, and judicial powers. (2) The Western powers retain administrative control over nine government departments: foreign affairs, disarmament, management of the Ruhr area, handling of refugees, Allied security, foreign trade, German prisoners of war, UN economic aid, and education.</p>
<p>(3) The three powers have veto power over any German legislation that violates the principles of occupation. (4) The occupation authorities deeply hope that no further intervention will be necessary outside of the aforementioned nine departments. (5) When receiving instructions from their respective countries, the occupying powers may take certain measures, when necessary, to maintain the democratic system in Germany. (6) Before exercising the powers mentioned in the previous article, the occupying powers will notify the West German government and explain the reasons for taking such measures. (7) The West German government has no power to abolish the occupation statute. (8) After one year, within eighteen months, the occupying powers will review the occupation statute again and decide whether to grant the German government greater authority.</p>
<p>Granting Germany Autonomous Opportunity Has Semi-Treaty Nature</p>
<p>[United Press Bonn 10th] The occupation statute established by the United States, Britain, and France has a semi-treaty nature. The full text is about 700 words. It will take effect as soon as Germany establishes a Federal Republic, which is expected around July 1st. The contents of the statute grant the 45 million people of West Germany an opportunity for autonomy.</p>
<p>West Germany Re-Drafts Constitution Based on Three-Power Agreement</p>
<p>[Reuters Bonn 9th] The Bonn Assembly, in view of the fact that the constitution previously drafted had not been approved by the Allied powers and the new situation arising from the Washington Agreement, has drafted a provisional constitution for West Germany to serve as the minimum legal basis for the German government and parliament to begin work. The leader of the German Social Democratic Party in the constitutional assembly believes that since the three-power agreement has given Germany the opportunity to obtain an independent government and participate in the European group, Germany should not easily give up. If the Allied powers insist that financial powers should be individually controlled by the federal states and not centralized in the federal authorities, Germany can only try it, even if it considers it impractical. However, the Social Democratic Party also stated that their concession was not voluntary but was due to the intervention of the Allied powers, which made the new West German constitution no longer a democratic constitution but merely a kind of administrative regulation.</p>

<h3 id="e44">British Prime Minister Attlee Points Out That Two Soviets Are Responsible for Dividing the World; Soviet Side Accuses Bevin of Pursuing Unfriendly Policy Toward the Soviet Union <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters London 10th] Prime Minister Attlee today delivered a blunt speech on Soviet communism at a Labor Party rally in Glasgow, accusing the Soviet Union of being responsible for dividing the world. He said that the Atlantic Pact is not aggressive but purely defensive. To attack the pact is motivated by evil intentions. The Soviet Union is like Germany before the war, thinking that the defensive combination of other countries is an encirclement of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Attlee said that the Atlantic Pact is not the first action of the Western countries. First, there was the Marshall Aid Agreement, which was warmly welcomed by the European countries that had suffered from the war. The Eastern European countries originally intended to participate in the agreement, but after a little hesitation, the Soviet Union immediately stopped them. We do not give up hope of uniting the world, but it must be done by the Communist Party abandoning its attempt to force the world to accept its doctrine and force everyone to wear the straitjacket of Lenin-Marxism before the world can move towards unity. We believe that the human spirit should be free, and this is the creed of British socialism.</p>
<p>[Reuters London 10th] Moscow Radio commentator Livonidov today asked British Foreign Secretary Bevin to cite a fact to prove that the Soviet Union had ever threatened Britain, France, the United States, or any participating country of the Atlantic Pact. Livonidov said that no one in our country believes that the general people of Britain are willing to end British friendship with the Soviet Union. Livonidov also pointed out that one of the main promises of the Labor Party during the election was to promise to strengthen and develop British-Soviet friendship. Bevin himself once said that the Labor Party would aim at close cooperation with the Soviet Union. Everyone knows that this promise has never been fulfilled.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The symposium on developing the city's industry and commerce and the exchange of materials between the north and south was held at the City Hall conference room at 9:00 AM yesterday. The meeting was originally presided over by Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison of Beijing and Shanghai. However, Tang went to Changzhou on official business and was replaced by Chen Liang, Secretary of the Municipal Government. Officials and representatives from various industries and businesses present included Cao Jingwei, Xu Jiyi, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Yan E'sheng, Shou Jingwei, Lu Jingshi, Hong Nianzhu, Tian Heqing, Cai Xintao, Hu Xiyuan, Ouyang Lun, Wan Molin, Pan Shihao, Shen Xirui, and others, more than 30 people in total. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Chen Liang reported on the purpose of the meeting and distributed written discussion outlines as follows: (A) Review of the current economic situation: (1) soaring prices, (2) excessively high interest rates, (3) insufficient reserves of food, fuel, and other daily necessities. (B) Cash shortage problem: (1) Cash shortage affects the lives of public employees, (2) affects the maintenance of social order, (the most worrying thing is labor-management disputes). (4) Issuing large bills and using promissory notes and checks have the same effect of stimulating prices. The latter two are even more stimulating. (5) Please ask the Central Bank to provide as much cash as possible (especially for government agencies, public enterprises, and factories). (C) Issue of exchange of materials between the north and south: (1) The necessity of exchange of materials, (2) The scope of exchange of materials. (Imported materials include food, fuel, daily necessities, and industrial raw materials; exported materials include those that do not affect military affairs or people's livelihoods). (3) Establish an institution to review the types and quantities of exchange materials. (4) Establish a joint operation institution for exchange of materials. (5) Under the current circumstances, the exchange of materials is directly negotiated by manufacturers and firms; the government can provide assistance.</p>
<p>Discussion Begins</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, Xu Jiyi, Pan Shihao, Wang Xiaolai, Xie Tiansha, Tian Hexiang, Luo Qinghua, and Ye Fukan expressed their opinions, analyzing the formation and gains and losses of the current economic situation in detail. Generally, they all believed that the exchange of materials between the north and south was indeed necessary, but the implementation method needed to be studied. Finally, Chairman Chen Liang summarized the results of the discussion, saying that the most pressing issues at the moment are food, fuel, and prices. The municipal government and relevant agencies discuss the food issue every day and believe that it will proceed as planned. The fuel issue has also been effectively resolved by the competent authorities in accordance with the established policy. The price issue will still be handled by the Economic Conference composed of sixteen agencies. In addition to the economic conference, there are also issues such as the cash shortage, the purchase of raw materials for factories, the production and sales of industrial products, and many specific issues related to the exchange of materials between the north and south. The final decision was</p>

<p>Last week, prices rose crazily, which greatly affected people's lives. Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun and officials from the National Bank held meetings in Shanghai to discuss countermeasures. It has been decided to expand the sale of gold and silver this week to tighten credit and suppress prices. According to sources, in addition to gold, the long-prepared sale of silver dollars will officially begin this week. Since the Central Mint resumed minting last month, it has minted more than 6.7 million new "boat dollars," which have been continuously transported to the National Bank's treasury. Except for two times when the Business Bureau distributed them to customers, most of them have not been touched. This week, the market price can be slightly stabilized.</p>
<p>Also, rumors that the Central Mint will stop minting boat dollars and switch to minting Yuan Datou dollars have been denied by the person in charge of the factory, who stated that it is absolutely not true.</p>

<p>At a stage where price increases are nearing madness, a steamed bun costs 500 yuan. Recently, the National Bank shipped back a large batch of five yuan gold yuan bills printed in the United States. The gold yuan bills were originally ordered in the United States during the price limit period in August last year. They were only shipped to port today and cannot be circulated on the market. The National Bank failed to complete the printing and issuance of the gold yuan bills in time, and by today, they have almost become waste, resulting in huge losses. The responsibility is being investigated.</p>

<p>Wu Shangzhi, the chief of the Suzhou River branch of the Municipal Water Police Bureau, was involved in corruption and dereliction of duty. He arbitrarily detained people without following legal procedures. He did not try to solve theft cases in the area, nor did he report them to his superiors. All these facts have been personally and thoroughly investigated and confirmed by Xu Guang, the chief of the First Supervisory District in charge. The relevant police officers have been detained. Wu Shangzhi, the police station chief, fled in fear of punishment on the afternoon of the 9th. The Supervisory District is currently compiling investigation materials and reporting them to Director Mao for review, and at the same time notifying all branches and stations to assist in the arrest.</p>
<h3 id="e53">New Method of Wage Payment by British Electric Tramway Company; Labor Union Hopes for Early Improvement <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The British Electric Tramway Company's delay in paying wages for too long has caused more serious disputes between labor and management. It is rumored that the disputes have been resolved, but this is not the case. On the contrary, they are brewing. For this reason, the reporter specifically visited the company's industrial union to find out the truth. According to Qiu Changjiang, the chairman of the union, since the drastic fluctuations in prices in the past ten days, five of the city's six major public utilities (French Electric, Power, Telephone, Gas, Water, and British Electric) have improved their wage payment methods to avoid huge losses to employees. However, the British Electric Tramway Company failed to accept the workers' requests and has not improved. The wages for the first half of this month were delayed for seven days, and as a result, 100,000 yuan in wages were affected by rising prices, leaving only 46,000 yuan. Therefore, the workers are very dissatisfied and hope that the company can understand the difficulties of the labor side and pay wages in the same way as the other five unions. Otherwise, they will resolutely strive for their rights through legal channels until they achieve their goals. Finally, Chairman Qiu earnestly stated that the entire workforce is currently in a state of indignation, and the labor union is trying to persuade them. However, it is better to resolve the matter as soon as possible. If it is delayed, it will inevitably lead to problems!</p>

Unexpectedly, it passed lightly through Yixian Road and turned into the intersection of West Tiyu Road, where it knocked down the 950 police officer Jie Lingbin (42 years old, from Shandong) from the Tiyu Road police station of the Xinshi Street police branch. Jie sustained injuries to his waist and abdomen, and his brain was concussed, barely breathing. Unfortunately, misfortunes never come singly. In a panic, the driver hurriedly moved the steering wheel, trying to escape. A new military truck led by the Jiangyin Fortress Command came head-on and was also hit by the car, damaging the front and internal mechanisms. The police officers from the police station arrived and detained the offending soldier, transferring him to the branch for investigation.

<p>[Report from our correspondent in Suzhou on the 10th] After the mystery of Shui Yao Chen's disappearance in the dismemberment case on Huji Road in Shanghai was revealed, the police suspected that another person named Guo was also a victim. Guo Guoliang, an employee of the Hangzhou Railways Bureau, had a son named Maofu, who worked as a clerk in the Suzhou Military Prison. He also disappeared before the dismemberment case occurred. However, his father came to Suzhou a few days ago and found his son, who returned to Hangzhou with him. The fact is that Guo took a leave of absence at the time, and the letter was delayed in arriving, causing a misunderstanding. This second mystery of disappearance has also been cleared up.</p>

<p>For a week, prices have been like a runaway horse, changing several times a day, which is not only related to the lives of citizens but also affects social order. In view of the above situation, the municipal government has decided to strengthen economic controls to stabilize prices and maintain people's livelihoods. With the consent of the relevant agencies, an Economic Council has been established to control prices. The outline for the organization and implementation of the Economic Council was drafted by the Social Affairs Bureau and will be submitted for discussion at the first meeting tomorrow, after which it can be implemented. Regarding the causes of the continuous price increases, Cao, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated that according to reports from the relevant departments, this crazy price surge was led by gold yuan and silver dollars and was purely manipulated by speculators. However, gold yuan and silver dollars are not within the scope of control of the Social Affairs Bureau, so he specially reported to Secretary-General Chen of the Municipal Government and obtained the consent of various agencies to establish the Economic Council. Rates will be set for rice, coal, and other important daily necessities to regulate them. The detailed methods will be drafted today and submitted for discussion at tomorrow's meeting.</p>
<p>According to relevant authorities, the continuous price increases are led by rampant off-exchange gold and foreign exchange transactions, and are purely manipulated by a few speculators. Close attention will be paid to the situation. At the same time, off-exchange trading telephone lines will be dismantled to reduce the possibility of price manipulation of coal, rice, oil, yarn, and cloth. It is reported that a few large players have been driving up prices in the off-exchange gold, US dollar, and securities speculation market, which affects the lives of citizens. The authorities have been paying close attention to the situation and will deal with it according to the law.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Gu Xingyao, 22 years old, from Haimen, is the younger cousin of Gu Xingtian, 40 years old, a store clerk at the Dongtaifeng Textile Machinery Trading Company's office on the fourth floor, number 40, of the China Industrial Bank Building at the intersection of Beijing Road and Huqiu Road. He was previously a small worker in the company. He was laid off due to corporate downsizing last winter and returned to his hometown. Last winter, he married Zhang Shuizhen, 20 years old, a fellow villager who worked as a female worker at the Datong Yarn Factory in Haimen. Not long after the marriage, due to unrest in the area, they came to Shanghai together on February 28th of the lunar calendar. They have been in Shanghai for more than two weeks and have been staying with relatives and friends every night because they have no money. The day before yesterday, Zhang was introduced by her cousin Xingtian to work as a maid at the home of an employee of Dongtaifeng. It was stated that she would go this morning. Since the original residence was inconvenient, the couple stayed at Xingtian's place the night before last (that is, in the office of Dongtaifeng Company). At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Xingtian went out on business, leaving only the two of them in the room. During a casual conversation, Zhang told Xingyao that life in Shanghai was becoming more expensive and that it would be better to return to their hometown. She expressed her unwillingness to work as a maid. Gu saw that his wife insisted on returning to their hometown, and his attempts to dissuade her were unsuccessful, leading to a quarrel. Xingyao suddenly became angry and murderous. He grabbed a blanket and threw Zhang to the ground, trying to strangle her. She resisted with all her might, but he did not succeed for a while. Xingyao suddenly saw a pair of small scissors on the table. He grabbed them and stabbed Zhang's face wildly, first blinding her by stabbing her eyes, and one eyeball flowed out. Then, he stabbed her face more than ten times. Zhang was injured and cried for help, grabbing her husband and refusing to let go. Xingyao then stabbed her throat, chest, abdomen, and other parts more than ten times, and Zhang died of her serious injuries. Seeing that he had caused a disaster, Xingyao fled in a panic to the gate downstairs. Yang Feizhang, the section member of the Huangpu Police Bureau, who was patrolling with police officers, saw that he was covered in blood and knew that something had happened, so he stopped him for questioning. The murderer's face was pale, and he was incoherent. At that time, his cousin also returned and learned that his cousin's wife had been stabbed to death. The police officers immediately went upstairs to inspect and found the deceased lying stiffly in a pool of blood, with a slight warmth in her chest. She was wearing a blue velvet cheongsam, a Shilin cloth jacket, gray striped trousers, and yellow leather shoes. Her feet were tied with ropes, and she had been stabbed more than thirty times. The police officers immediately telegraphed Chief Feng and Section Chief Liu to the scene for investigation and notified the photography section of the headquarters to send personnel to take photos for record. The body was then transported to the autopsy office. The murderer was taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, the deceased had thrown the scissors at him first during the conflict, so he killed her in anger. He also claimed that she had had an abortion once in her maiden's home, and this time she insisted on returning to her hometown because she was probably going to live with her lover again, so he killed her in anger.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Northeast Assets Inventory and Disposal Committee, formerly located within the customs, disbursed 60 million yuan in relief funds to refugees from the Northeast at the Huangpu Police Station in this city on February 7th. The funds were disbursed using special checks numbered 1 to 4,000 issued by the Central Bank, with face values of 10,000 and 20,000 yuan each. Unexpectedly, some of these checks were stolen. The committee has already issued a public statement and sent a special letter to the Central Bank for investigation.

Recently, Mr. Mo Dehui, in his own name, wrote to the District Court, requesting it to follow legal procedures, issue a public notice, and rule to void the rights associated with the stolen checks in order to protect the committee's interests.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Liang Beihe and his wife, Chen Yueqi, were both overseas Chinese from Canada. They married on July 29, 1933, in Vancouver, Canada, through an introduction. In September of the same year, Liang returned to China and practiced medicine in this city. At the end of the same year, he brought Chen back to China to live with him. However, Chen, accustomed to life in the West, felt very uncomfortable with life in her motherland. She repeatedly asked her husband to live abroad with her, but Liang refused. Their relationship deteriorated, and Chen repeatedly requested a divorce so that she could live abroad alone. Liang tried to dissuade her in every possible way, and she reluctantly lived in Shanghai for several years. In the autumn of 1940, on the eve of the outbreak of the Pacific War, Chen again asked her husband to live abroad with her. Liang resolutely refused, and Chen immediately bought a ship ticket and returned alone. However, Chen then purchased a ticket on the Japanese Empress ship and left without informing him. By the time Liang found out, it was too late to stop her. Afterwards, Chen's whereabouts were unknown, and her life or death was uncertain. Liang asked friends to search for her in Canada in every possible way, but without success. Last month, Liang filed a petition with the District Court, requesting a divorce from Chen. The court has now ruled to grant the divorce.</p>

Furthermore, as this city is an international metropolis and the union is a representative of all workers in the city, the previous chairman, Shui Xiangyun, the current chairman, Zhou Xuexiang, and all executive directors and supervisors planned to build a new building. They also received support from Deputy Minister Lu of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Labor and called on all workers in the city to respond unanimously. As a result, the fundraising work was carried out actively. At the Third Members' Representative Assembly in November of the 36th year, union members from all industries enthusiastically donated one day's wages, and the funds began to take shape. After collecting this money, all of it was used to purchase materials. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Social Welfare Commission donated the remaining materials from the Labor Hospital, and Mayor Wu allocated 20 million gold yuan, which provided considerable assistance. In addition, floating capital was used for lending and earning interest, so that the payment of construction wages could maintain the original currency value. Finally, it was stated that the smooth construction of the union's current building relied on the guidance, assistance, and donations of leaders from all sectors of the city, leaders of various labor unions, workers from various industries, and the enthusiastic support of all executive directors and supervisors of the fifth and sixth sessions, which ultimately led to its construction. The cornerstone has now been laid, and in a few days, we will see its completion. After Executive Supervisor Ye Xiangju reported on the fundraising process, Deputy Minister Lu Jingshi, Director Zhao Zukang, Director Cao Peizi (Lu Yun Dai), and others delivered speeches in succession. Finally, Executive Supervisor Shui Xiangyun gave a reply, stating briefly: The General Labor Union has been launching the construction of a new union building for more than a year. In the past, we only heard the sound of the stairs, but no one came downstairs. Now that the materials are complete and the cornerstone has been laid, the doubts of the general public can be dispelled from now on. This construction is not only a home for all workers in Shanghai, but will also promote the construction of buildings for labor unions throughout the country. With a magnificent building, the social status of a labor union can be improved invisibly, and it can also highlight the progress of China's labor movement in the international community, and further demonstrate the power of worker solidarity. In this regard, the spirit of the workers can be seen. According to the current estimates, the materials for the completion of the auditorium are still insufficient (approximately 4,000 shi of rice are needed). It is hoped that the workers of the city will continue to work hard to complete the construction of the auditorium. One monk is four, and 40,000 workers have great national strength. Unlike monks, who are empty of the four elements, as long as everyone takes a deep breath and exerts their strength, the goal will be achieved, and the auditorium will be completed. Following this, the cornerstone laying ceremony was held. After taking photos, the ceremony ended, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Reason for the Disconnect Between the Cost of Living Index and Commodity Prices; Many Unpopular Goods Included in the Categories; Price Surveys Conducted Four Times a Month Must Be Averaged <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special] If I were to say, "The cost of living index is very scientific and very accurate," countless salaried people who live according to the "cost of living index" would certainly stare at me with disbelief! The ironclad fact before our eyes is that the city's 1.3 million salaried people have personally experienced that the "cost of living index" has never kept up with the actual prices. Is it reasonable to calculate salaries using such an index? The answer is self-evident, but the blame does not lie with the index itself.</p>
<p>Some people may ask: Since the cost of living index is based on commodity prices, why is it so far out of sync with the price multiples? This question must be answered in two ways. First, the cost of living index is fundamentally not a price multiple. It includes many "unpopular goods." The rate of price increase for "unpopular goods" is extremely slow. After the index is averaged, it is naturally not as high as the price multiples of general goods. Second, although the cost of living index includes many "unpopular goods" with relatively slow rates of price increase, it should not be so far out of sync with the price multiples. Therefore, the key to the problem must lie elsewhere. What does this mean? We are influenced by habit, and every time we mention the four words "cost of living index," we naturally think of what the municipal government publishes on the 15th of the month and at the end of the month. In fact, what the municipal government publishes in the middle and at the end of each month is not the real cost of living index, but the average of the four cost of living indexes in half a month. This is because each time a price survey is conducted, a cost of living index is generated. This index is indeed the comparison number between the price survey on that day and the cost of living on its "base period." However, when the four indexes in half a month are added together and divided by four, the resulting "average index" is bound to be out of sync with commodity prices. Therefore, although there are more than one reason for the disconnect between the cost of living index and commodity prices, the biggest key lies in the "average index."</p>
<p>The Larger the Price Increase, the Greater the Difference</p>
<p>During the era of fiat currency, we often heard the phrase "price increase in [month]." At that time, commodity prices increased intermittently and cyclically. For example, after the price increase in May, commodity prices in June and July would be relatively stable, so the difference in the "average index" would not be too large. Now it's different. Look at how commodity prices are increasing every day. According to the trajectory of price increases in recent months, almost every commodity is increasing by about 10% every day. Regardless of whether this is the government's fiscal policy or the inevitable result of malignant inflation, in short, this orderly daily increase is making the difference between the cost of living index and the average index larger and larger. To give a simple example: on the 4th of this month, each dan of white polished rice cost 180,000 yuan, which is 9,000 times higher than on "August 19" of last year. On the 8th of this month, each shi of white polished rice cost 220,000 yuan, which is 11,000 times higher than on "August 19." The average is 10,000 times. Assuming that the base salary is 20 yuan (which could buy one shi of rice on August 19 of last year), if we give him 9,000 times on the 4th of this month, multiplying the base salary would give a salary of 180,000 yuan, which can still buy one shi of rice. If we give him 11,000 times on the 9th of this month, multiplying the base salary would give a salary of 220,000 yuan, which can also buy one shi of rice. However, if we give him the average of 10,000 times to multiply the base salary, then it would only be 200,000 yuan. On the 9th of this month, 200,000 yuan can only buy nine dou of rice.</p>
<p>Formula for Compiling the Index</p>
<p>The cost of living index should not be a mystery. It is a sacred scientific product. No one can manipulate it, and anyone can compile and calculate it themselves according to a certain formula. The calculation method is to find out the current prices of the following quantities of goods one by one, add them up, and use the sum as the dividend. Then, add up the prices during the price limit period of August 19 of last year and use the sum as the divisor. The quotient obtained is the cost of living index on the day you used the commodity prices. The current index is based on the worker's household survey conducted by the Public Concession of the Municipal Council in the 30th year of the Republic of China, which includes four categories and 54 items:</p>

<p>Various Demands for Salary Payment Methods</p>
<p>As for salaries not keeping up with commodity prices, there are many other reasons. For example, the date of salary payment is also a relatively serious issue. For example, if the index is published on the 31st, and the salary is not paid until the 4th of the following month, and commodity prices increase by 40% during these four days, then the salary you receive is discounted by 60%. Therefore, the General Labor Union formally calls for a weekly wage system, and even demands daily wage payments. There are also proposals for payment in kind or in silver yuan, so there are many different options.</p>

<p>Yu Shuping, the former director of the Municipal Police Bureau, recently responded to the objections raised by the Shanghai Lawyers Association regarding his practice of law after leaving office. He stated that he had applied to the District Court and the High Court for registration in accordance with the provisions of the Lawyers Law and had submitted the approved registration documents to the Lawyers Association to apply for membership and to be issued a membership card. The membership card number is 1581, and it was received before the 5th of this month. The legal procedures have been completed, and there seems to be no problem with practicing law. As for whether police officers should also recuse themselves, Article 13 of the Implementing Regulations of the Lawyers Law has clear provisions. The judicial officers referred to therein do not include police officers other than prosecutors. At the same time, there are many former colleagues from the police bureau who have practiced law after leaving their positions, and no problems have occurred. It is hoped that the executives of the Lawyers Association will provide guidance in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3 id="e70">A-League Football Game; Longtou Narrowly Defeats Zhichao <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the second round of the A-League football game between Longtou and Zhichao, Longtou narrowly defeated Zhichao by a score of 2-1 after a fierce battle of 90 minutes in strong winds. Longtou controlled the overall situation, adopting an offensive posture from beginning to end, but could not find a way to score. Five minutes before the end of the first half, Zheng Bingyi committed a foul in the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick. Qian Yuanqing scored with one shot, and Longtou actually conceded a goal first. In the second half, Longtou continued to attack fiercely in the tailwind, but struggled to find a shooting opportunity. Zhichao's entire army retreated to defend against the wind. Wu Qixiang led the three armies, fighting hard with their backs to the goal, and goalkeeper Sheng Peter was extremely busy. Finally, within 30 minutes, they scored two goals and turned defeat into victory. After the second goal, a defender kicked the ball with the wind, and Chen Qin deflected it into the net. The spring wind was strong, and it was cold and about to rain. The audience at Yiyuan was sparse, with fewer than 2,000 people. The game was chaotic. Although Longtou's kicking skills were solid, their coordination and communication were poor; otherwise, they would have won a major victory earlier. Zhichao's young players lacked skills, and Wu Qixiang could not support the building alone.</p>
<p>Longtou attacked first, and Shi Dafa shot out of bounds. Jiang Kun shot powerfully from 20 yards, and Xia Shufu headed the ball, missing by a hair. Zhichao counterattacked, and Xu Guoping backhanded a shot from 15 yards, which was caught by Yan Chengkuan. Longtou attacked again and was again caught by Sheng Peter. Longtou's offensive was fierce, but it failed to succeed. Wu Qixiang took the ball far out, and Guan Yongchang penetrated and hooked it. Yan Chengkuan jumped up to catch the ball and was knocked down by Wu Zhemin, who was penalized and sent off. Stalemated for 40 minutes, Longtou's misfortune came. Zheng Bingyi touched the ball with his hand in the penalty area, and Qian Yuanqing heavily penalized a penalty kick, shooting it into the bullseye. The score was one to zero, and Zhichao took the lead. Five minutes later, the first half ended.</p>
<p>The two teams fought again, and the Longtou generals vowed to recover the lost ground, attacking desperately. Zhichao's hinterland was severely ravaged. However, the forwards lacked the skill of finishing, failing repeatedly. Longtou killed so enthusiastically that the central defenders came out to assist in the battle. Zheng Bingyi kicked a long ball towards the goal, the ball landed and bounced, and Sheng Peter jumped up, but the ball had already entered the net. The score was tied. Zhichao's spirit waned, and Wang Burong took advantage of the situation again, plugging into the center. Chen Qin deflected it in close range, making it two to one, and Longtou took the lead. The silver horn sounded, and Longtou narrowly won by a score of 2-1.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to statistics from the Shanghai Power Company, the figures for the company's supply of electricity for lighting and heating to ordinary households in the city in recent months are as follows: In November of last year, lighting electricity was over 10.78 million degrees, and heating electricity was over 1.34 million degrees. In December, lighting electricity was over 11.94 million degrees, and heating electricity was over 1.50 million degrees. In January of this year, lighting electricity was over 13.15 million degrees, and heating electricity was over 1.65 million degrees. In February, lighting electricity was over 13.15 million degrees, and heating electricity was over 1.55 million degrees. March has not yet been finalized, but it is likely to be higher than February. These figures show that although electricity prices have been adjusted dynamically based on the base number, they have not had the effect of saving electricity for ordinary households. On the contrary, electricity consumption for lighting and heating has only increased. Furthermore, the industrial electricity supplied by the company was over 30.08 million degrees in November of last year and over 43 million degrees in December. In January of this year, it was over 46 million degrees. In February, due to more holidays during the Lunar New Year, it was over 41 million degrees. In March, it was over 50 million degrees. This shows that the need for electricity in the city's industry is increasing every month. Therefore, the saying that the city's industry is shrinking does not seem to be true. Furthermore, there are currently many troops stationed in the city, and most of them do not pay for the electricity they use for lighting and heating. The power company's loss from this is approximately 1% of its total revenue.</p>
<p>The Last Scene of Basketball League Group A1; Hualian Will Battle Enkas Tonight</p>

It is said that the team has won all four championships of the league. It is also learned that to increase interest before the game, a friendly match will be added, with the Basketball Committee facing off against the Basketball Referees Association. Ticket prices will be moderately increased to 2,500 yuan for the upper floor, 5,000 yuan for the lower floor, and 8,000 yuan for reserved seats inside the venue.
