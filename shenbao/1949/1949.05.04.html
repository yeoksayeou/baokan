<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓三日廣播：參眾兩院外援監督委員會主席麥卡倫告新聞記者稱：陳納德將軍曾在該委員會秘密會議中力主美國立卽給予中國國民政府以軍事及經濟援助以免中國內地淪於中共統治之下。渠估計此項援助需三億五千萬美元。陳氏稱：「吾人敬以用於柏林空運之同樣款項，援助中國政府，則中國內地可獲保全」。麥氏稱：除非美國幫助國民政府抵抗中共，東亞可能被新的「鐵幕」所籠罩。麥氏又稱：陳納德指出中國有七個省份決不向中共投降，而將「作戰到底」。陳氏謂蔣總裁爲國民政府治下全民一致追隨之人，自一九四五年以來，蔣氏之政府迄未自美國獲得軍事援助，至彼時所獲得之配備均已用罄或損壞。陳氏稱：「據餘所知，吾人所供給之配備流入中共掌握中者，寥寥無幾」。陳氏預料中共如在中國成功，將長驅直入越南，而向印度推進。陳氏並不主張派遣美軍至中國，但謂美國應派遣軍事代表團及政府代表前往中國，直接分配美國援助物資。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約三日電〕眾議院非美活動委員會共和黨議員聶克遜二日提議，由參眾兩院派遣委員會至中國調查，以決定美國對華政策。聶氏在美猶反共聯合會午餐席上宣稱，美國外交政策已不復能託付於決定雅爾達及德黑蘭協定之人，國務院應宣布對中國共產黨及共黨聯合政府不與援助，並放棄中國共產主義與他國不同之主張，須知全世界各國之共產主義，無不相同。</p>

<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕西太平洋美艦隊司令白吉爾之發言人三日返滬，據談美海軍照舊辦事。白吉爾之旗艦「埃爾杜拉多」號已駛返青島，上海區美海軍司令克勞福留駐長江口之旗艦「契爾頓」號上，艦上有美海軍陸戰隊一營，美海軍在長江尙泊有驅逐艦與登陸艦不久亦可開到。美海軍在青島駐有數艦，倘開足速率，一日內卽可駛抵長江。</p>

<p>〔合眾社華盛頓二日電〕共和黨眾議員周以德二日指責蘇聯在柏林作和平試探，僅欲在其接管亞洲大陸之際，改換美國之注意力。</p>
<p>周氏力言中國之戰爭，實爲希臘，土耳其，伊朗及其他各地爭鬥之關鍵所在，蘇方政策旨在使美國注意力集中歐洲，以便蘇方在亞洲前進。歐洲已遭焚如，必須賴富有資源各區之產品以生活，而蘇聯現正佔取有資源之各區，周氏復抨擊前國務卿馬歇爾爲「僅係一軍人」，並無外交背景，且誤認中國之共產黨可使之加入聯合政府，中國現雖處于苦境，然「日後我人需要中國，將較中國目今需要我人，更爲殷切」</p>
<p>周氏認爲蘇聯之主要擴張目標在亞洲，而蘇方首領已用詭計使美國之注意力與努力，大部份集於歐洲。杜魯門政府集中一切可能的權力於行政首長及小隊皇宮衛士，卽顧問之掌握，此種趨勢有在美國成立獨裁判度之虞。總統及其皇宮衛士定下政策，而要求國會在預留之點綫上簽署。</p>
<h3 id="c7">對「紫水晶號」事件　艾德禮再發聲明　英未考慮承認中共政權 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕艾德禮首相二日在下議院中答議員問時，再度就英艦「紫水晶號」事件發表聲明，艾氏表示遠東英海軍司令於中共砲擊「紫水晶號」後，如果愿意，可請英空軍協助掩護英艦溯長江上駛，但遠東英海軍司令並未採取此舉，艾氏謂，渠對該司令此項決定，表示贊成。艾氏又強調重申「紫水晶號」，係根據實施已有相當時日的慣例，執行和平使命，決無強行通過長江之問題。艾氏又解釋稱，距離長江最近之英空軍戰鬥機係在二千哩以外之馬來亞，全程需時卅六到四十小時，保守黨議員泰勒指出自紫水晶號成爲共軍砲火射擊目標後，整個局勢卽立卽變更，蓋此乃海盜行爲，然則用飛機掩護其他英艦上駛豈非必要，艾德禮答以當地司令認爲應當採取的手續乃爲儘可能迅速派艦上駛，以冀在和平的條件下，儘述救出英紫水晶號。</p>
<p>［路透社香港三日電〕此間海軍發言人聲稱，中國使者已通知被困長江中英艦紫水晶號之司令，由於長江一帶尙在戰爭狀態中，故該艦必須繼續泊在原地不許移動。該發言人所稱中國使者殆係中共之使者。渠並曰，在中國內戰雙方保護該艦得安全通過以前，英海軍不擬移動該艦，英海軍當局至目前爲止，尙未能與任何中共中央當局接觸，以接洽該艦之安全通過。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕英外交部發言人，評華盛頓郵報批評英國對中共政策之事稱，承認中共政權之問題，迄尙未曾發生，目前亦未在考慮中。</p>

<p>〔中央社廣州三日電〕中央文化運動委員會主任委員張道藩氏，頃發表「五四」運動的認識一文，茲節錄如次：</p>
<p>「五四運動是中國近代革命史上最有光輝的一頁，我們年年紀念「五四」，年年應有反省。</p>
<p>「五四」運動的遠因，是三民主義文化思潮所鼓動淘鑄的，清廷腐化之後，一般知識份子多感於國家民族的危機，奮發而起，爲自救運動，康有爲的公車上書，號召士大夫份子起而議政，其結果乃有維新。惟因當時運動的目標，走錯了君主立憲的歧路，而參加此一運動的份子，又僅爲士大夫之流，未曾普及於名階級的智識份子，故而此一運動，不久卽歸於失敗。總理因揭三民主義的大旗，以介國民革命，方向旣極端正確，復以黨人宣傳之深入，故能普及於各階層的人士，於是智識青年及思想界領導人物，咸能有革命的自覺，流波所及，遂演成光輝史乘的「五四」運動。故卽今而紀念「五四」，吾人不能不飲水思源，應爲三民主義而盡其最大的努力。</p>
<p>「五四」運動的本質，最初是由於軍事運動，倡導的人是曾國藩·左宗棠·李鴻章輩，其目的是造大砲，練海軍，設船帆等，此卽當時所謂洋務運動者。但軍事僅爲政治之一部門，政治旣未革新，故軍事亦無結果，而當時搜括的軍費，乃徒用之頤和園的奢豪。新軍事運動失敗之後，遂有康有爲·梁啟超等的新政治運動，欲以君主立憲的神符，挽救清廷的末運。但政治不能與民生脫離，亦不能與文化脫節，不革新文化而欲革新政治，那是徒勞無功的。所以總理批評以上兩個運動，都是不揣其本而齊其末的辦法，因而創爲三民主義新文化運動，期使政治革命與社會革命畢其功於一役。五四運動發生之後，總理即爲之正名，說·這是一　新文化運動·，只有這一新文化運動展開了，而後國民革命乃能加速度的發展。故即今而紀念五四，應知救亡圖存運動，實以新文化運動爲其根本。乃近年以來，共產黨徒另搬出一套新經濟運動的理論，此即所謂經濟史觀或難物史觀者。姑無論他們的行動，只表現生產的大破壞縱無經濟的新建設，這已是名實不符了。縱使目前共產黨徒有若干軍事上的僥倖，但其終結，亦必隨文化上之失敗而歸於毀滅。而所謂新經濟運動，亦必重蹈新軍事運動，新政治運動的覆轍。五四運動的口號，是科學和民主，在此科學和民主的兩面大話之下，造成整個學術和社會的新風氣，時至今日，科學和民主已遇着極大的危機，科學是反教條的，但共產黨則以馬列主義爲聖經，民主是反專制的，但共產黨徒則欲盡趨國民於專制的鐵幕之內，果眞共產黨徒能有一時的僥倖，則我們科學和民主運動，勢將倒退數十年，這眞是文化的大厄運。我們要紀念「五四」，必須重揭科學民主之大旗，與共產黨徒的教條主義和極權政體奮鬥到底。</p>
<p>最後，「五四」運動的直接導因，是外抗侵略，內除軍閥的。因爲智識青年所發的正義恐嚇，使北洋軍閥不能不改變其賣國的外交，此事史乘具在，毋須贅述。惟吾人不能不有所慨嘆的。就是時至今日，共產黨的新軍閥，正勾結新侵略主義，以奴役我民族和國家。在「五四」的當時，智識青年尙能不異犧牲，奔走呼號，與軍閥及侵略主義者相搏鬥，而時至今日，則對於此種新軍閥和新侵略主義者，盡其沉默，容忍，屈服之能事，其尤甚者，更震懾於暴力的淫威，支援於盧布的誘惑，從而對此新軍閥與侵略主義者，爲之作違心的宣傳，或甘心供其指示，竟淪爲第五縱隊的爪牙，而不知恥辱。現在正義的呼聲，已經消沉了，我們於紀念五四之餘，應當喚起五四運動的靈魂，重新拿出民族主義的大旗，向新軍閥的共產黨徒，和新侵略的共產主義，作徹底的反擊。智識青年們，這是我們一起奮鬥的時候了，我們的民族永不會奴役，國家決不會滅亡，最後的努力，一定獲得最後的勝利。</p>

<h3 id="c27">社論　上課第一！ <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>四方多難，終及上海，她已披上戰衣，準備萬一。看情形，上海聽到砲擊似還須隔相當時日；保衛大上海，當局已一再表示有決心，有把握。然而在這個局面下，民族命脈所繫的敎育，却成了極嚴重的問題，使我們不得不向政府·敎師·學生和社會，發出懇切的呼籲，請求大家尊重這神聖的事業。</p>
<p>新任市長陳良，出身敎師匠，深知敎育事業的重要，也親嘗過粉筆生涯的甘苦滋味，故在市庫空虛如洗的時候，別的薪餉緩發，獨敎育經費羅掘先給，他並大聲疾呼：「爲敎育而敎育」。博得全市人民喝彩。目前敎育衹要維持，敎師只在吃飽，這種起碼要求，業已極慘。前天市校代表晋謁市長·局長，提出六項要求：（一）發尊師米每人二石；（二）一次撥清本學期薪津；（三）發清所欠實物或照市價折算差金；（四）預給師範生和寄宿生食米及副食費；（五）準備郊區和蘇州河以北搬運費；（六）水電費照四九六四號訓令迅速抵付。這些事都近人情，都該解決的。至於疏散學校無家可歸的師生，以及集中管理學生，也宜予以合理的處理。</p>
<p>政府之於老師應盡職責：老師之於教育，也該守住崗位。當我們讀到法國杜德氏「最後一課」，敎師　精神是何等的偉大。上海局勢雖忽緊忽弛，人心惶惶；但敎師究是人羣領袖，把這顆心要寗靜下來，想想我們的下一代，照常上課，是天經地義的，授課是敎師的第二生命，絲毫不得躲避。我們　到今天的各種悖逆，敎育者總該想到於教化未行。「敎化行，則禮義興而風俗美」，敎師是執行敎化的人，假使沒有善盡敎化的責任，「化民成俗」，便成一句空話。假使滿肚子以黃金美鈔為第一，則一般人自將奉「老大」，「老二」爲上帝。管夷吾在特異篇所講的：「倉廩實則知禮節，衣食足則知榮辱」的一套話，乃指普通人而言，決非對人師而說。做人師者「謀道不謀食」。要像西漢大師董仲舒所說「正其誼，不謀其利，明其道，不計其功」。王船山夫子對衣食廉恥先後有所闡發：「衣食足而後廉恥興，財物阜而後禮義作，是執末以求其本也。……」像這樣已得而復失的敎師精神，我們必須要找尋回來。到校上課，是良心的責任，是兒童青年跑在敎師前所哀求的。</p>
<p>今日青年學生的心理，正像民十五國民革命時代。假使自治有方，本位努力，非特自己不致吃虧，即學校亦受益非淺；無奈血氣方剛的青年學生，目睹吏治的啙窳，民生　憔悴，乃忘了自身立塲，不知讀書是學生天職，動輒罷課，造成敎育界空前混亂的現象。長此以往，若不設法糾正，則第二代的前途，實堪憂慮，將來青年，成大事，立大業，豈可望之於不學無術之徒。聽從學生應敎師之言，服膺聖賢之敎，一生受用不盡。正義的老師總不會領你們到沒有佛的廟裏去燒香的。莘莘學子都是民族未來的英俊，我們不可不以負責的態度，愛此輩可畏的後生，在你們身上找尋新興中國的希望。</p>
<p>如今各校上課情形太差，有時有敎師少學生，有時有學生少敎師，甚且敎師終日無閑坐無學生可敎，或學生徘徊學校，終日無課可上，這固是大家忙於搬塲和逃難，或向茫茫前途發愁發急，或因生活重擔壓得透不過氣來，事屬可憫，情有可原。可是像這樣的狀態，也要拖下去，豈是青年兒童之福！我們旣與政府敎師和學生三方面講過話了，茲欲請社會負點敎育下一代的責任。學生家長和社會人士該督促子弟照常入學或轉學，嚴加敎管，勿令聽其遊手好閒，無所事事。同時並盼幫助學校幫助敎師解決政府所不能解決的困難，至少不要增加他們的困難。敎萬元的行政費是學校經費困難，十萬倍的，以救眉急而挽回一髮所繫將墮的敎育。沒有停課的事實，切不發出停課的消息，驚擾師生，使得精神渙散。這次市立中等以上校長會議決案是：「請敎育局分函本市各日夜報，凡有關停課之消息，必須得敎局所發新聞稿然後發佈。」這是值得注意的。總之，敎育是國家的事，也是社會的事，請求大家一致尊重這神聖的事業！</p>
<h3 id="c28">傑塞普馬立克再度會談　柏林封鎖即可解除　四外長會議日期尙待商定 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三日廣播：倘馬立克接受傑塞普之邀請，則四强將於本日商談解除柏林封鎖及召開四强外長會議之日期。據悉，英，美，法三國對於解除封鎖及召開四强會議之程序，已獲致協議。又四强現已同意在巴黎召開外長會議，至解除封鎖及召開巴黎會議之日期則猶待商討決定。西方三强建議於五月廿三日召開外長會議。據悉馬立克曾建議於六月第二星期內之某日解除一切限制。西方三强則希望指定五月九日四强同時解除一九四八年三月廿六日及以後雙方所設置一切障礙。據悉，蘇聯建議於召開外長會議前一星期雙方同時解除一切限制。本日之會談倘能如期舉行，預料四强代表將同時討論四强發表公報，宣佈四强恢復德國問題談判之決定。關於馬立克是否有權直接決定各項日期之協議，抑必須將西方之建議向莫斯科請示後再行決定，倫敦方面人士此刻尙不能斷定。</p>
<p>〔合眾社紐約三日電〕本文三强可望於三日向蘇聯提出在下週末結束柏林封鎖的計劃。外交靈通人士稱，如蘇聯接受上項計劃，則柏林封鎖及反封鎖將能在五月十一日到十四日解除，四强會議則將在五月廿五日左右在巴黎召開。該消息靈通樂，上項計劃將由美國無任所大使傑塞普提交聯合國蘇聯首席代表馬立克，上項計劃係由傑塞普及聯合國英代表賈德幹·法代表蕭佛爾在二日草擬者。據悉，西方建議中包括下列各點：（一）傑塞普·賈德幹·及蕭佛爾準備「在以後數日內任何時間」與馬立克在此間開始四强談判，在二月十五日以後，傑馬二人早已對柏林問題開始直接談判。（二）西方國家支持在下週同時解除柏林蘇聯封鎖及西方反封鎖。（三）本文國家同意決定在巴黎召開討論德國問題的四强外長會議的日期，其時間約在兩星期以後。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約二日電〕美代表傑塞普今日與英代表賈德幹及法代表蕭佛爾會議一小時許，俾對蘇聯所提柏林解除封鎖條件，商定共同態度。會後，三國代表發表公報稱，討論「進展順利」，惟三國意見是否已一致，則未說明。大致尙待各本國政府最後核准。美代表團發言人稱，在星期三之前，不致與蘇代表馬立克接觸，提出三國方面覆文。傑氏曾於上星期杪赴華盛頓向國務卿艾契遜報告談判經過，並於今晨與艾氏作晨後量晤談後，卽乘飛機來此召開三國會議。據可靠消息，傑氏卽可於一二日內約晤馬立克，屆時柏林解除封鎖事，卽可作最後決定。今日三國會議公報全文稱，「傑馬兩氏開始談判以來，英法代表隨時接獲充分報告。本文三國代表亦不時晤談，對於此種非正式談判進展情形交換意見。今日之會議不過其中之一次。每次四國談判均須相當時間，此次不能例外，尤其是其中三國京城相距遙遠。所可言者，談判進行滿意，一如星期五夜。惟爲避免誤會起見，今日討論內容殊未便先事發表。」</p>
<h3 id="c29">美英法立塲一致　願與蘇合作解決德國問題　新談判應以新局勢爲基礎 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎二日電〕消息靈通方面稱，美代表傑塞普與蘇代表馬立克，現正就解除柏林封鎖及召開四强會議事起草公報，其內容尙未向英法政府提出。此間人士强調美英法三國對於德國問題立塲一致，據悉，目前尙待決定的主要點，爲四强會召開的日期。西方强國已建議於五月十五日召開此一會議，而蘇聯則贊成在六月十五日召開。法外長許曼今日亦已證實蘇聯已接受西方國家要求恢復四强談判之各初步條件，四已就召開四强會議之事獲致協議。</p>
<p>許氏否認外傳英國與法美就處理此事意見分歧之說。此間高級外交界人士相信，艾契遜於上月在華盛頓與貝文及許曼談及蘇聯試探解決柏林問題時，三人之意見已完全趨於一致。美國係於三强獲致協議後，始授權傑塞普再與馬克進行細則討論。據探悉美英法三國之意見大致如下：</p>
<p>波茨坦協定壽終　西方握王牌在手</p>
<p>卽自波茨坦協定以來，蘇聯已第一次採取守勢，而輪到西方國家第一次取得主動的指揮地位。三國相信柏林的封鎖及西方强調對東德及東歐的反封鎖，已迫使蘇聯在冷戰中趨於遷就一般僉料在召開的四强會議中，蘇聯將提出斷然的計劃，要求立卽恢復德國的統一及撤退一切佔領軍。西方國家則將答以須待和約簽訂後，始能撤退駐軍。三強願與蘇聯合作，以促成對德和約的締結。同時三强並將聲明波茨坦協定業已死亡，四强的新談判應以新局勢爲基礎，尤其是以前進三强在華盛頓成立關於西德的協定爲基礎。職是之故，蘇聯如圖援用波茨坦協定，必將爲三强所拒絕。西方三强將歡迎蘇聯提出建議，使東德亦得基於波恩憲法，與德國其餘部份合併。西方三强同時亦將向蘇聯聲明，東德之與德國其餘部份合併，應以東德已有民主條件存在爲條件，例如舉行自由選舉，撤銷秘密警察，言論得以自由，各政黨得自由活動，並由盟國共同監督前項條件之執行等。西方觀察家預料蘇聯將拒絕此等關於東德之條件，如東德不能與西德合併，則西方盟國可能建議在東西德間建立某種橋樑，此項橋樑爲在柏林純由德人組織之一聯絡委員會，以處理東西德間尤其是經濟上的關係。如果意外地蘇聯竟能同意關於東德之條件，則誠不失爲戰後西方國家的一最大勝利。不然，如柏林之聯絡委員會成立，至少可使西方國家在完全由蘇控制的區域內取得一立足點。總之，德國問題發展至今，西方國似握有下屆四强談判的王牌在手。</p>

<h3 id="c52">美國會立法程序 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 巴特曼作</p>
<p>在美國國會通常任期內，經提出的法案有好幾千件·國會爲應付這一番工作負担，並對每一建議作適當審查，曾建立一個立法機構，以便所有法案通過它而成爲法律。</p>
<p>當某件擬議中的法律送達眾院或參院，交由全體議員考慮並投票時，它早已經過周全考慮，決定它是否有立爲法律的需要，原提案是否適當與可行，是否合乎選民的意思。照例它的內容會由政府內外的專家研究過，有關的個人或團體的意見也被聽取並記錄過。它由一批在某一方面相當熟悉的立法者的委員會審查過或修正過</p>
<p>在以前七十五屆（按現在新國會爲第八十一屆）中，被提出的法案，數在七十二萬五千件以上。主要就由於立法機構傳襲的抉擇措施，平均第十二件中衹有一件構成法律。大部分未經通過的法案都在到達國會總辯論以前被撤回了。</p>
<p>提供立法的建議往往由國會所在地卡庇托爾山以外創議，一大部分的法案都是政府的行政機構要求的結果。總統在他致送國會的每年一度的咨文中，一定提議若干他認爲對國家福利極關重要的法律，每一個施政的部門也提出一些在它這一方面的立法方案。工商組織·消費者團體·工會·農會等也由於與參眾議員保持接觸而使國會對他們的需要加以注意。個人的情形也一樣。有許多法案係由於一個立法者或國會委員會的單獨調查而產生。</p>
<p>在許多的整合上，初步的研究進行在法案起草之前。法案一經起草，其次一步驟就是由參院或眾院的議員在院會中提出。初步研究的程度各不相同，它通常與法案題目的重要性與有關的人及利益的數量成直接的比例。</p>
<p>以馬歇爾計劃爲例，國務院專家先對擬議中的歐洲復興計劃作一個廣泛的研究，作爲馬歇爾國務卿在哈佛大學開學典禮演說時向全國提出意見的前一步驟。</p>
<p>以後，由於公眾反應良好，政府的全部配備都用來進行通盤的研究與調查。國務院完成了關於計劃各方面的基本文件，「卽歐洲復興大綱」，其中並已包括送交國會的計劃草案。另外有一個由總統委任的「哈里曼委員會」，該委會以現任馬歇爾計劃國家的巡迴大使哈里曼爲主任，包括若干金融家·工業家·私人經濟學家·與生產專家，曾提出一個對馬歇爾計劃國家的需要的估計，作探索性的研究。由總統所委任的其他兩個團體，對於這種需要對美國經濟與自然資源的影響，作成詳細的報告，這些報告書總數達一百萬字。</p>
<p>眾議院鑒於援歐計劃的重大意義，曾進行進一步的行動。在議案提付公開審查以前，外交委員會的十六人小組委會在赫特議員領導之下，前往歐洲從事實地調查。</p>
<p>這樣緊張的準備工作，衹有對非常重要的立法，才會進行的。尋常的初步調查比較不廣泛，由眾院或參院議長所指定的常設委員會進行。常設委員會爲立法過程間的中樞性的因素。它們都有主席一個主持，主席照例爲國會多數黨的黨員。少數黨的委員與多數黨的委員有它們一定的比例，由任參議員或眾議員資歷最高的一人領導。參院的常設委員會有十五個，眾院有十九個，每個主管一特定方面，這中間包括撥款·農業·軍力·公共土地·退伍軍人事務·銀行與貨幣·與外交等委員會。委員會的任務是將適當與不適當的法案分開，並使提出的法案擬訂得更爲妥善。調查的根本方式是公開徵詢，由有關的人出席陳述其意見。</p>
<p>一個法案可能照原案在委員會內通過，也可能稍稍加以修正，或被擱置。擱置往往會取消一項法案，除非有一批在眾院提出方案的眾議員投票强迫該委員會將法案交由全院討論</p>
<p>不少法案係由各委員會自行提出。衹要委員認爲有制成法律的需要，他們可以採取行動。在國會前次會期中，參院有個小組委員會旅行全國，在各城市調查關於房屋情況的意見，所得的情報就被用來作爲第八十屆國會通過房屋法律的基礎。</p>
<p>法案經過委員會審查，當被認爲卽可交由全體議員考慮，卽被排上立法日曆，以便全院辯論。所有法案在制成法律以前，必須獲得兩院的同意。往往一個擬議中的措施爲一院所通過，而爲另一院所反對，馬歇爾計劃法案就有這種情形。當這種情形發生時，有一個由兩院議員所組成的會議委員會卽被選出，對兩院的異議加以研究，並劃撥一個可望接受的法案，交兩院再議而予以通過</p>
<p>法案經國會核准，卽算通過了初步順序的最後階段，它被印上羊皮紙交由參眾兩院各委員會的主席審閱；以證明完全正確。參眾兩院議長在羊皮紙上簽署以後，就送交總統請其簽字同意。</p>
<p>如法案爲總統所否決，那末兩院又得重新考慮。但兩院仍以三分之二的多數通過，雖總統表示反對，仍可超越否決權，而令法案制成沒有總統簽字的法律。（美國新聞處譯）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕今日爲新任上海市長陳良氏接任之第二日，記者特走訪陳氏，詢及一般市政設施，承發表談話如下：</p>
<p>目前最感動盪者，厥爲人事問題。公用事業等價格可以調整甚高，公敎人員俸給則甚低落，以致造成社會上極大之矛盾，循至人事不能安定，最爲缺憾。關於市府全盤之人事，擬卽着手調整，最智短期內卽可決定，經決定後自可庶政一新，共同邁進。</p>
<p>至於上海現狀，因軍事之嚴密配備，保衛較長時期，使上海永遠存在，可謂絕無問題。現在所亟應解決者，厥爲煤荒，已與台灣省政府洽商，用面粉·紗布·日用品交換台煤，陳主席已允每月換撥四萬噸，並指定台灣物資調節委員會司徒主任負責辦理。惟本市每月用煤量，須達十萬噸，原已另電台省府請加撥三萬噸，現在更已決定先由烟煤調節會·中央信託局·四礦聯營處限在兩星期中，以布十萬匹，每匹對煤一噸，先行交換十萬噸。並另請中央銀行緊急購儲五萬噸，則今後煤荒，卽可全部解除。</p>
<p>花園屋面　計劃種菜</p>
<p>燃料問題解決，則一切生產及水電供應自可無缺。在食的方面，倘肉類缺乏，可用魚代替，本市瀕臨江海，魚產最富，且魚類較肉類尤爲營養。蔬菜方面，萬一江運阻隔，則可將私人花園及市內空地，悉予開闢種菜，甚至私人屋頂，亦可設法利用，已請農業專家草擬計劃，一俟計劃擬定，卽將強制實行。</p>
<p>總之，今天上海衹要米監兩種來源能獲暢通，一切生活問題，均可自給自足，而獲得圓滿之解決，市民之生命與生存，均可無虞，重以軍事之配合，上海卽不啻金湯也。</p>

<h3 id="c92">香港金潮點滴 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　冷哲祺</p>
<p>〔本報香港廿二日航訊〕關於香港「金潮」，連日復活假期中的諸多推測，本月十八日假　後，斯告明朗，計有如下各端：</p>
<p>（一）港府迄未收購黃金，據其發言人說：「假如政府要買金，儘可至南非去買，還更便宜。」</p>
<p>（二）銀行私人保險箱並未搜查，但個人存金應向政府登記。</p>
<p>（三）港府限人民購買飾金，不得超過三兩，購者須留下地址，九五金或廿二K金可以自由流通。</p>
<p>（四）市面仍盛傳英鎊跌值，美鈔黑市已由每元值港幣五元三角，漲至五元八角左右。</p>
<p>（五）澳門的葡幣也漲。港幣一元，僅值葡幣七角五分左右，過去值八角左右。</p>
<p>（六）袁頭每個值港幣五元八角左右，過去值四元左右。</p>
<p>（七）港中飾金，今日每兩出三百八十元左右，進三百四十元。過去（金潮前）衹值三百二十元左右。</p>
<p>（八）全市已在向澳門轉移陣地中。</p>
<p>（九）不獨金融市升漲，商品市場亦多波動，生仁連日至將二萬件，十八日早盆只成六十三·四元左右，下午卽陸續收盆報高，不再平賣，各種豆類，更藉疏狹，紛紛報起，麵粉市本屬最頹，昨日亦跟風隨起，沙士堅麵粉本港成十四元，有出口證者，由十七元二，升至十七元四，西藥市亦紛紛全作動，肺針，盤尼西林針，丹杜蓮，史塔杜邁仙等均紛紛報高。紗布升價最烈，各種色白布，每疋報高一·二元，廿支紗每包升二十到卅元，四十二支紗報高六·七十元。</p>
<h3 id="c93">東方之珠　食與住在香港 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>〔香港廿六日航訊〕誰都聽過一句這樣的話了：「住在杭州，死在柳州，食在廣州！」從來沒有人說「食在香港」的，雖然香港在地理上，和廣州僅是一水之隔。</p>
<p>由於這樣，我要來談談香港的飲食，就未免有點難了；但，且慢，俗語說得好：「好有好講，醜有醜講！」所以，我要是不避「拉什成篇」之嫌，一樣可以來談它一陣的。</p>
<p>誠如我上面所說，香港不是一個以飲食著名的地方，或者換一句話來講，就是香港人根本就沒有一個「食不厭精，膾不厭細」的要求，所以，這裏除了公價米會經常求過於供之外，而四毫錢一磅的公價麵包，一塊錢一磅的公價餅乾，就成爲了此間的「特產食品」了！</p>
<p>這麼說來，也許有些正牌的香港人，以爲我的話是近於刻薄和侮辱了他們的尊嚴吧，他們一定會抗議：「你不能够這樣說呀，你沒有看見這裏的茶館，酒樓，餐室……多得像五步一樓，十步一閣麼？又沒有看見，那些三五百元一桌筵席，每日都在被食客大量點呌麼？但，對於這樣的質問，我却立刻就可以來一個反詰，難道這就呌做懂得飲食麼？從這一切就可以證明香港人是十分看重「吃」的麼？不！香港人所以上大酒家，所以要呌三五百元一席的菜，往往不過只是要吃「面子」，吃「排塲」罷了，那裏有不惜以大量金錢的找求美味的「笨伯」哩！至於那些爲了要「應酬」，一天上幾次茶館，你如果說他嘴饞這才冤枉啊！</p>
<p>然而，在這裏，眞正的老饗和「知味」的食客，也不是沒有的，在閒常的時候，我們就見到不少人，不惜「冒險」到筲箕灣之類的地方，去吃其「三六」；在灣仔　頓球塲，交功街，對漲榕樹頭……等地方，也不時會見到一些西裝筆挺者流，在撚著牙簽，蹲在牛什檔的面前，津津有味地吃著東風螺！不過，這些說來實在還是少數。</p>
<p>在這裏，大多數人，究竟是以吃吃西餐爲榮的，因此，流風所及，咖啡，紅茶便佔有了「普洱」，「龍井」；又代替了臘腸卷和叉燒飽，而且更有趣的會，有些人到了這裏，甚至連毎朝「一盅兩件」這點「國粹」也不再保存，而爭著要喝去了！</p>
<p>誰都知道，廣東人是什麼也可以吃牠一頓的，蛇也好，鼠也好，蟲也好，都一樣「照擦！」香港人自然也保留著這種習性，所以，這裏賣「牛什」的小販，就多得像放了哨位來站崗的警士一樣，幾乎走過任何一條大街小巷，你都可以發見一兩檔這樣的小食担的，它那香噴噴的氣味，加上塗了顏色的肝臟，倒也十分誘起人家的食慾，這裏的小市民差不多十人中就有八人是嗜這些東西的，他們把這種小食和涼茶，同時稱之爲「可口可樂」。記得有一位外地的詩人初來這兒，走到街上時，一眼瞥見了這些「牛什」，不禁嚇得睜大眼睛，問人道：「這是吃的麼？是不是人的臟腑？」說到人肉，如果在這裏也有得出售，那未免是迫於奇談了，但，要是眞有一個這樣的老饗，他要嘗嘗人肉怪味的話，那麼，在此我也可以向你介紹：請你拿出五塊錢來罷，到蕭頓球塲上走走，如果是住在九龍的，不妨移玉往榕樹頭，這樣，你就大可以淺嘗一下了！（恕我的說話，有點離題，但，我得解釋：這也是一種「食在香港」之一啊！）</p>
<p>在本港住上一些時候的人，誰都知道灣仔有一條俗稱「爲食街」的橫街的，旣被稱爲「爲食」，那麼，照我上面所談香港不講究飲食一說，豈非不足爲信？但，我得告訴你，這「爲食」那兩個字的內涵，原來就只是：不管好歹，都「擦」其一頓而已！</p>
<p>香港人爲什麼不比廣州人講究飲食呢？</p>
<p>理由說來是很簡單的：因爲香港是一個找食不易的地方啊！</p>
<p>以下，且再來談談往的情形。</p>
<p>「東方之珠」，這是一個屬於香港的榮譽的稱號。是的，這兒有整齊的街道，蒼翠的山色，加上四時皆春的氣候，於是，在某些人看來，不正是一顆「掌上」的「明珠」麼？</p>
<p>那麼，一些未到過這裏的人也許都會這樣的想罷：一定是滿舒服的了？但，事實並不如此！試想想，這裏方圓不過二十多里，却擠上近一百八十萬的人口——聽清楚，是一百八十萬啊，那又怎樣會生活的舒服哩！</p>
<p>自然，這些都是拿一般小市民的情形來說的，這裏有一句俗語就說得好：「有錢樓上樓，沒錢地下痞」所以，除了更多的「地下痞」者之下，舒舒服服地住在「樓上樓」的人也不是沒有的</p>
<p>香港的樓宇，有一個異於別處的特色，那就是：一般民房，大都建築成一個樣式。說這裏的民房是「白鴿籠！」我眞佩服創造這個形容詞的人的聰明了，請你閉目想想：當你乘著輪渡在這裏過海的時候，一列列的「鴿籠」不是清楚地陳列在你的眼前嗎？看啊，「鴿籠」這兩個字是多麼形象化！</p>
<p>假如有人問：這樣的一座「鴿籠」，可能住上多少人哩？那麼，現在就讓我們來計算一下罷，假如這座樓房是四層的，每層有四個房間，兩張床位，（事實上，有許多床位還間成上下，一共四張或六張的哩！）一個房子平均住上大小六口，一張床位平均睡兩個人，這樣一來，一間「鴿籠」就可能住上一百一十二人了！（請你不要小覷這個數目呀，在軍隊裏，有了這個數目，已足够　成一個完整的「連」了，而且，在內地有許多小鄉村，一村共計也沒有這麼多的人哩！）</p>
<p>照這樣的情景看來，說這房子是「鴿籠」不過也只是形容了它的外形罷了，至於它的內容，如果要我找一件具體的東西來比擬的話，我想，只有「沙丁魚罐」可膺其選了。</p>
<p>這樣多的人擠在一間房子裏，照理，應該是十分熱鬧的罷？然而，不知道這裏的人們，爲什麼都好像通通沾上了一種「老死不想往來」的風氣似的，雖然大家同住　一座樓子裏，但往往二樓不知三樓姓的是什麼，頭房不曉得尾房是何種的職業，互相一天見幾次面，却從來不會點一點頭，要是誰呌到對方一聲：「早安！」便立刻可能招致至一種懷疑的眼色，和見到一副尷尬的臉孔。這裏有一首豐當流行的歌謠：「頭房笑，尾房哭，二樓請喜酒，三樓買棺木，牛鬼蛇神同一宅，三敎九流共一屋！」這寥寥數語眞是把這裏的羣居什處情景，和「住」在香港的特色，形容得淋漓盡致了！</p>
<p>說來這兒實在不是一個處處住的地方，但，這並不緊要，香港人是從來不會爲「住」這一個問題苦惱的，因爲香港人的生活哲學是：「住家不妨狗　，出外少不了一身光鮮」，住所迫窄一點，骯髒一點有什麼相干呢？這只要你不把住址隨便告訴給陌生的朋友就行了！</p>
<p>「住」在這裏，還有一大特色，那不妨也趁此談它一個罷。這裏的二房東太太是特別有名的，「包租婆」的大名，說來誰個不曉呢！在某些小說裏，劇本裏，或者報章的漫畫裏，我們都不時見到她們的丰姿和面影了，所以實在無庸我來再化筆墨介紹，但，也許有人會問：爲什麼我們從來不曾聽到過有「包租公」這一名稱的呢？難道凡包租者都是寡婦或老處女麼？答曰：並不，原因是這裏的二房東大都採取「總統虛位制」，於是，大權就無形中落於這「責任內閣」的閣揆中，而實至名歸，也就自非偶然了！</p>

<p>— 瑞瑞</p>
<p>〔本報汕頭一日航訊〕由馬來亞被遣返的難僑，已有兩批　輪截抵汕市，都是集中到星加坡遣來的。這一大羣難僑，經過半年以上的囚禁，現今才獲得自由而被驅逐出境，他們悲慘的遭遇和馬來亞演出這幕排華悲劇的殘毒手段，令人寒心。記者此次巡視「難僑招待所」訪問時，他們都滔滔不絕的告訴了這椿慘絕悽絕的事件的始末。</p>
<p>馬來亞的排華運動，自去年開始日趨惡化，迨至六月間，來亞英政府頒佈「緊急法令」，每一個政治部的人員或暗探特工，均授以絕大權力，他們可以任意逮捕認爲「有罪」或應該逮捕的人，更不必有任何實際證據，排華行動由此達白熱化了，這些負有使命的暗探特工，到處橫行，乘權勒索，公報私仇，濫捕建功，馬來亞的處境，乃陷入了空前的悲慘的地步。</p>
<p>緊急法令的措施，雖然馬來亞政府說是爲了對付「暴徒」，安定地方，但實際上是對付華僑的藉口，排華的進一步行動，半年多來，在全馬各地被「緊急法令」而逮捕拘禁的男女老幼達一萬人以上，這一大羣不是暴徒，却都是安份守已的善良華僑，初期的時候，被逮捕的人還少，一個月以後，這種緊急的行動便日漸蔓延了，當地的特工，對於動亂日甚的局面，無力鎭壓，却遷怒到我們無辜的僑胞身上來，居然將許多市鎭和鄉村的華僑男女老幼，不分良莠，全部拘禁起來，罪名是「知情不報」，其間且有一部份被毒毆與姦淫，華僑被驅逐出來之後，居住着的房屋和財產，更被進行燒毀，大火蔽空，不但華僑數十年來慘淡經營的血本，付之一炬，而且有的妻離子散，家破人亡，這些被捕的人，老者不能行動，幼者不會言語，也會有「暴動」的嫌疑嗎？</p>
<p>在馬來亞「緊急」行動之下，犧牲的全是華僑，焚燒的暴行更把華僑一切的全部</p>
<p>基業毀滅了，其中損失最重的是比州和豐連冬路一帶，房屋被焚近千間，難僑被捕移送班底埠者達二千餘人，其餘的逃散四方，雪州加影加焦埠全鎭店屋六十餘間燒盡，難僑千餘人被捕，森州沉香島及泉溝尾難僑被捕一千五百餘人，比州端洛及督亞冷一帶房屋被焚四百餘間，難僑被捕達千人，吉蘭州毛先及牙拉頂二處房屋焚去二百餘間，被彈炸傷數十人，被捕二百餘人，雪州新古毛膠園工人廿四人被集體包圍，開槍屠殺，玻璃市洲新隆鎭全部店屋被焚，其他金馬各村莊，膠園，工廠，礦塲的華僑，被殘暴虐待或無理逮捕，動輒以千百計，華僑的損失，估計不下數億叨幣之巨，最近馬六甲及柔佛各州被捕富戶已有四十餘人，其中有擁資達數百萬元者，都被指爲贊助「暴徒」，財產被沒收了，尙未遭「緊急法令」所危害的一切華僑，生命財產同樣沒有保障。</p>
<p>不論如何是藉口在對付當地暴徒，首當其衝遭受危害的就是華僑，馬來亞英政府把華僑房屋店鋪財產焚毀刧奪凈光後，再把這一大羣被捕的</p>
<p>華僑拘禁起來，送到孤島上的集中營去，不准親屬探視，和外界一切都隔絕，受盡飢餓與凌辱的苦痛，有的難僑因不堪無端被拘之恥辱，切腹自殺，且有婦女演出上吊的悲劇，以示抗議。</p>
<p>由於半年多來到處不斷任意「肅清」與拘捕結果，各集中營都有人滿之患，馬來亞政府對這批「嫌疑犯」該怎樣處置，成了問題，要把華僑判定罪名旣不可能，要釋放又無善後辦法，這一大羣的難僑房屋財產都燒光了，無家可歸，無業可就，一旦釋放之後，苦無去處，結果衹好出此一策，把難僑一律遣送回國，這本來就是馬來亞政府的排華眞面目，需要的時候，歡迎華中，招之來，不需要的時候，遣送出境，驅之去。</p>
<p>由捷豐捷盛一代代輪載來的</p>
<p>華僑兩批男女老少共七百餘人，就在這種情形之下被遣送回來的，其中多數是潮梅籍，並有部份廣　及廈門籍的，他們數十年來歷盡千辛萬苦，用盡心血換來的基業，遭此橫禍，全部化爲灰盡，現在剩下來的是一付射手和襤褸不堪的破衣，有的是離鄉背井數十年之久，鄉情全斷，有的是出生異域的僑生，何處是家，何所適從呢？這個問題一旦沒有善後解決，他們又有淪爲難民的悲慘遭遇了。</p>
<p>遣回來的難僑這是前頭的第一二批，爲數不及十分之一，以後尙有成萬人在「集中營」準備「驅逐」回來，汕市這個多災多難的地方，已成爲難僑登岸遣送的轉口港了。</p>
<h3 id="c95">華僑與印尼間　寫下了血海深仇 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 曼萍</p>
<p>曾一度被譽爲「革命之母」的華僑，在第二次世界大戰結束的前夕，多少是染上了一些「到今天總該輪到我們揚眉吐氣」的味兒，然而殘酷的事實却又毫不留情地粉碎了這期待了卅幾年的美夢。</p>
<p>假若我們不很健忘的話，總記得國你奔走革命期間，華僑對這億萬人所祈待的寵兒——中華民國——的誕生，不論精神上抑或物質上都曾有過相當的貢獻，這種愛國熱的心理之所以形成，往往不易被人了解而喻爲日本式的「神密的愛國熱」，有的甚而竟以「南洋伯」譏之，其實海外華僑因爲他們的處境而產生的愛國熱決不會是那末單純，他們僑居異域，切身所感受到的剝削；壓迫以爲種種不合理的刺激而產生這種必然的結果——愛國熱。決不是國內同胞所能普遍地了解進而引爲同感的，這種愛國熱鼓舞着他們在可能的範圍內盡量地作人力物力的貢獻。</p>
<p>「聽說某埠已到了不少戴笠帽穿草鞋」（注：這是海外僑胞稱國軍的代名詞）說這話的人底神氣確乎不可一世，慢說是自己同胞爲了這句話而感到興奮，即使在當地土人聽來也不免有（今天的華伯確不得罪的預感）然而這一切都經不起無情的事實的打擊，首先給他們過不去的是日寇降的第二，清晨升上去的國旗，在爲了避免誤會的理由下，被強制立即降下，接着便來了一九四六年三月萬隆（Bov-ndoeng）大火的探試，從這火海的試探下，他們獲得了相當的成功，便是他們獲悉了我們的政府對華僑的生命財產的安全是不很感到興趣的。</p>
<p>跟着萬隆火海之後，印尼革命份子的極端派爲要粉碎華僑在爪的經濟基礎的完成，便在文登（Bonten）舉行了一次空前的大屠殺，如剝皮；肢解；強姦等，無所不用其極，這種慘絕人寰的暴行，從此便在兩民族間寫下了一頁永不磨滅的血海深仇，荷政府把握着這矛盾，便發動了所謂華僑自衛隊的組織，一般刧後餘生的同胞爲了家仇己恨，拿起荷政府發下的槍枝對當地土人也確曾作過相當的報復，於是這兩大民族便在荷帝國主義的巧計的玩弄下，盲目地加深了這難於獲得詳解的仇恨，於是在土人控制下的中東爪各地便接連不斷的演出更殘酷更澈底的燒殺。直到目前爲止，蘇島依然在進行着那不人道的大屠殺，把華僑數百年來克苦經營的經濟基礎已摧毀得相當澈底了，再來一套官樣文章式的抗議，訪問有什麼效用呢？</p>
<p>啊！失去了父母底愛護的孤兒呵！血淋淋的事實是不會被人忘懷的！</p>

<h3 id="e2">Chennault Appeals for Aid at U.S. Congressional Foreign Aid Oversight Committee Meeting to Prevent China from Falling Under Communist Rule <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper] Washington, 3rd (Broadcast): Senator McClellan, Chairman of the Senate and House Foreign Aid Oversight Committee, told reporters that General Chennault strongly advocated at a secret meeting of the committee that the United States immediately provide the Chinese National Government with military and economic aid to prevent the Chinese mainland from falling under Communist rule. He estimated that this aid would require 350 million U.S. dollars. Chen said: "If we use the same amount of money as we used for the Berlin Airlift to aid the Chinese government, the Chinese mainland can be preserved." McClellan said: Unless the United States helps the National Government resist the CCP, East Asia may be shrouded in a new "Iron Curtain". McClellan also stated that Chennault pointed out that seven provinces in China would never surrender to the CCP and would "fight to the end". Chen said that President Chiang was a person unanimously followed by the entire population under the National Government. Since 1945, Chiang's government has not received military aid from the United States, and the equipment received at that time has been exhausted or damaged. Chen said: "To my knowledge, very little of the equipment we have supplied has fallen into the hands of the CCP." Chen predicted that if the CCP succeeds in China, it will drive straight into Vietnam and advance towards India. Chen did not advocate sending American troops to China, but said that the United States should send military delegations and government representatives to China to directly distribute American aid.</p>

<p>Texas Senate Passes Bill</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Austin, Texas, 3rd] The Texas State Senate unanimously passed a bill on the 2nd, requesting the U.S. government to immediately stop Stalin from controlling China. The bill stated that those in the State Department and diplomatic circles who have always regarded the Soviet Union as a peace-loving democracy and the Chinese Communist Party as land reformers unrelated to Moscow, and who have led our country into its current predicament, should all be dismissed by the U.S. government. If we allow the Chinese people to be enslaved by Stalin today and become vassals, it may drag the United States into war, not only fighting for security but also fighting for survival, to maintain the results of its victory in World War II, for which it sacrificed hundreds of thousands of lives. The bill was unanimously passed by the House of Representatives last Friday and will soon be sent to the President, Secretary of State, and Texas representatives in Congress.</p>

<p>[United Press Dispatch from New York, 3rd] Republican Congressman Nixon of the House Un-American Activities Committee proposed on the 2nd that a committee be sent to China by the Senate and House of Representatives to investigate and determine U.S. policy towards China. Nixon declared at a luncheon of the Anti-Communist League of American Jews that American foreign policy can no longer be entrusted to those who decided the Yalta and Tehran agreements. The State Department should announce that it will not provide aid to the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist coalition government, and abandon the claim that Chinese communism is different from other countries. It must be known that communism is the same in all countries of the world.</p>

<p>[United Press Dispatch from This City] A spokesperson for Badger, commander of the U.S. Fleet in the Western Pacific, returned to Shanghai on the 3rd and said that the U.S. Navy continues business as usual.

<h3 id="e6">Soviet Union Tests Peace in Berlin to Divert U.S. Attention; Judd Strongly Argues China War Cannot Be Ignored <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International Dispatch from Washington, 2nd] Republican Congressman Judd accused the Soviet Union on the 2nd of testing peace in Berlin only to shift America's attention while it takes over the Asian continent.</p>
<p>Judd strongly argued that the war in China is the key to struggles in Greece, Turkey, Iran, and elsewhere. The Soviet policy aims to focus American attention on Europe so that the Soviet Union can advance in Asia. Europe has been burned and must rely on the products of resource-rich areas to live, and the Soviet Union is now occupying resource-rich areas. Judd also criticized former Secretary of State Marshall as "just a soldier" with no diplomatic background and mistakenly believed that the Chinese Communist Party could be made to join a coalition government. Although China is in distress, "we will need China in the future more urgently than China needs us today."</p>
<p>Judd believes that the main expansion target of the Soviet Union is in Asia, and Soviet leaders have used tricks to concentrate most of America's attention and efforts on Europe. The Truman administration concentrates all possible power in the hands of the administrative chief and a small team of palace guards, i.e., advisors. This trend threatens to establish a dictatorship in the United States. The President and his palace guards set policy and demand that Congress sign on the dotted line.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Attlee Reissues Statement on "Amethyst" Incident; Britain Not Considering Recognition of the CCP Regime <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch from London, 2nd] Prime Minister Attlee reissued a statement in the House of Commons on the 2nd in response to questions from members of Parliament regarding the British warship "Amethyst" incident. Attlee stated that the British naval commander in the Far East could have requested assistance from the British Air Force to cover the British warships sailing up the Yangtze River after the CCP shelled the "Amethyst," but the British naval commander in the Far East did not take this action. Attlee said that he approved of the commander's decision. Attlee also emphasized and reiterated that the "Amethyst" was carrying out a peaceful mission in accordance with long-standing practices, and there was no question of forcibly passing through the Yangtze River. Attlee also explained that the closest British Air Force fighters to the Yangtze River were in Malaya, 2,000 miles away, and the entire journey would take 36 to 40 hours. Conservative MP Taylor pointed out that the entire situation changed immediately after the Amethyst became the target of CCP artillery fire, as this was an act of piracy. Was it not necessary to use aircraft to cover other British warships sailing up the river? Attlee replied that the local commander believed that the procedure that should be taken was to send warships up the river as quickly as possible, hoping to rescue the British Amethyst under peaceful conditions.</p>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch from Hong Kong, 3rd] A naval spokesperson here claimed that a Chinese envoy had notified the commander of the British warship Amethyst, which was trapped in the Yangtze River, that the ship must remain in place and not move because the Yangtze River area was still in a state of war. The Chinese envoy referred to by the spokesperson was likely an envoy from the CCP. He also said that the British Navy does not intend to move the ship until both sides of the Chinese civil war can guarantee the ship's safe passage. The British naval authorities have so far been unable to contact any central CCP authorities to negotiate the ship's safe passage.</p>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch from London, 2nd] A British Foreign Office spokesperson, commenting on the Washington Post's criticism of Britain's policy towards the CCP, said that the question of recognizing the CCP regime has not yet arisen and is not currently under consideration.</p>

At the same time, they are mobilizing bandit cadres to force young men to join the army in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places. Now, the people in the occupied areas have had their food almost completely plundered by the bandits, and their lives are difficult. Young men abandon their wives and children and leave their homes, and everyone is complaining endlessly, hoping that the National Army will recover the area as soon as possible and return to their embrace.</p>

In the end, the Communist bandits only retained a platoon of guards for Fu, and Fu, in his sorrow, saw no need to retain them and allowed the bandits to disarm them all. The above facts serve as a warning that seeking "partial peace" is practically equivalent to surrender.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Guangzhou, 3rd] The Control Yuan held its first meeting in Guangzhou on the morning of the 3rd, launching a heated discussion on future work issues. As no conclusions were reached, it was decided to continue the meeting at the original site on the morning of the 4th. Before the meeting, President Yu Youren led all members of the Control Yuan to Huanghuagang to reverently commemorate the Seventy-Two Martyrs. This meeting was the fiftieth meeting of the Yuan since the implementation of the Constitution, and also the routine meeting for May. Forty-five members, including Liu Zhe, Li Zhengle, and Qi Dapeng, attended, with Yu Youren presiding. After Secretary-General Li Chongshi reported on the Yuan's relocation to the south and the negotiations for the Yuan's site, all members stood and mourned the late member He Kefu. Zou Lu and Deng Huifang reported on the revolutionary achievements and funeral proceedings of the late member He. The members then discussed Qiu Niantai's proposal that the Control Yuan should have special measures to cooperate with the anti-aggression war after the government moved south. The original proposal put forward two measures: convening a special review meeting and organizing a military discipline inspection group. Members spoke one after another, sharply criticizing the political phenomena of corruption and incompetence, and unanimously called for strengthening unity, reforming politics, and carrying out the anti-aggression war to the end. Tang Honglie proposed that a telegram be sent in the name of all members to domestic and foreign parties, declaring their position and determination to resist aggression, because the Control Yuan had previously issued a declaration calling for peace, but now the situation has changed, and the attitude of the Control Yuan needs to be reconsidered. It was also proposed to send a telegram in the name of all members to Acting President Li, urging him to come to Guangzhou to preside over military and political plans. The key points of the members' speeches were collated by Wang Xiangchen and four others and submitted to the meeting on the 4th for discussion and decision. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Understanding the "May Fourth" Movement - Statement by Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Central Cultural Movement Committee <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd] Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Central Cultural Movement Committee, recently issued an article entitled "Understanding the 'May Fourth' Movement," excerpts of which are as follows:</p>
<p>"The May Fourth Movement is the most glorious page in the modern revolutionary history of China. Every year we commemorate 'May Fourth,' and every year we should reflect upon it.</p>
<p>The distant cause of the "May Fourth" Movement was the cultural trend of the Three Principles of the People, which stirred and shaped the era. After the corruption of the Qing Dynasty, intellectuals generally felt the crisis of the nation and the country, rose up vigorously, and carried out a self-salvation movement. Kang Youwei's "Petition of the Scholars by Public Transportation" called on the scholar-bureaucrats to rise up and discuss politics, which resulted in the Reform Movement. However, because the goal of the movement at that time went astray into the wrong path of constitutional monarchy, and the participants in this movement were only scholar-bureaucrats and not popularized among intellectuals of various classes, the movement soon failed. Dr. Sun Yat-sen raised the banner of the Three Principles of the People to promote the National Revolution. The direction was extremely correct, and the in-depth propaganda of the party members enabled it to be popularized among people of all classes. Therefore, intellectual youths and leading figures in the ideological circles were able to have revolutionary awareness. As a result, the "May Fourth" Movement, a glorious historical event, was developed. Therefore, even today, when we commemorate "May Fourth," we must not forget the source of the water we drink, and we should make our greatest efforts for the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>The essence of the "May Fourth" Movement initially stemmed from military campaigns. The advocates were figures like Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, and Li Hongzhang. Their goal was to build cannons, train the navy, and set up shipyards, which was then known as the Westernization Movement. However, military affairs were only one part of politics. Since politics had not been reformed, military affairs also came to nothing, and the military expenses that were collected at that time were used extravagantly for the Summer Palace. After the failure of the New Military Movement, there came the New Political Movement of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, etc., who attempted to save the fate of the Qing Dynasty with the magic charm of constitutional monarchy. However, politics cannot be separated from the people's livelihood, nor can it be divorced from culture. It is futile to try to reform politics without reforming culture. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen criticized the above two movements as methods of addressing the symptoms rather than the root cause. He thus created the New Cultural Movement of the Three Principles of the People, hoping to accomplish the political revolution and the social revolution in one battle. After the May Fourth Movement occurred, Dr. Sun Yat-sen rectified its name, saying, "This is a new cultural movement." Only when this new cultural movement is unfolded can the National Revolution develop at an accelerated pace. Therefore, even today when we commemorate May Fourth, we should know that the movement to save the country and ensure its survival is fundamentally based on the new cultural movement. In recent years, however, the Communists have brought out another set of theories of the New Economic Movement, which is what is called the economic historical view or the materialist historical view. Regardless of their actions, they only show the great destruction of production without any new economic construction, which is already a mismatch between name and reality. Even if the Communists currently have some military advantages, their end will inevitably be destroyed due to cultural failure. And the so-called New Economic Movement will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the New Military Movement and the New Political Movement. The slogans of the May Fourth Movement were science and democracy. Under these two high-sounding words, a new atmosphere of the entire academic and social community was created. Today, science and democracy have encountered great crises. Science is anti-dogmatic, but the Communists regard Marxism-Leninism as the Bible. Democracy is anti-autocratic, but the Communists want to drive the people into the iron curtain of autocracy. If the Communists are really lucky for a while, then our science and democracy movement will regress for decades, which is truly a great misfortune for culture. If we want to commemorate "May Fourth," we must raise the banner of science and democracy again and fight to the end against the dogmatism and totalitarian regime of the Communists.</p>
<p>Finally, the direct cause of the "May Fourth" Movement was to resist foreign aggression and eliminate warlords at home. Because the righteous intimidation of intellectual youths forced the Northern Warlords to change their traitorous diplomacy, this matter is recorded in history and need not be repeated. However, what we cannot help but lament is that, to this day, the new warlords of the Communist Party are colluding with new aggressors to enslave our nation and country. At the time of the "May Fourth" Movement, intellectual youths were still able to sacrifice themselves, run around and shout, and fight against the warlords and aggressors. But to this day, they have done everything they can to be silent, tolerant, and submissive to these new warlords and new aggressors. Even worse, they are intimidated by the power of violence and supported by the temptation of rubles, and thus make insincere propaganda for these new warlords and aggressors, or willingly provide their instructions, and have even fallen to the pawns of the Fifth Column, without knowing shame. Now the voice of justice has subsided. While commemorating May Fourth, we should awaken the soul of the May Fourth Movement, take out the banner of nationalism again, and launch a thorough counterattack against the Communists who are the new warlords and the communism that is the new aggression. Intellectual youths, this is the time for us to fight together. Our nation will never be enslaved, and our country will never perish. The final effort will surely achieve the final victory."</p>

<h3 id="e27">Editorial: Classes First! <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Troubles are widespread and have finally reached Shanghai. She has put on her battle clothes and is preparing for the worst. From the looks of it, Shanghai still needs to wait for some time before it hears the sound of artillery fire. The authorities have repeatedly expressed their determination and confidence to defend Shanghai. However, under this situation, education, which is tied to the lifeline of the nation, has become an extremely serious problem, forcing us to issue sincere appeals to the government, teachers, students, and society, requesting everyone to respect this sacred cause.</p>
<p>The newly appointed Mayor Chen Liang, who came from the teaching profession, deeply understands the importance of education and has personally tasted the bitterness of a teacher's life. Therefore, when the city treasury was as empty as a washbasin, other salaries were delayed, but the education funds were scraped together and given first. He also loudly appealed, "Education for education's sake." Which won applause from the people of the whole city. Currently, just to maintain education and to ensure that teachers are fed is already extremely tragic. The day before yesterday, representatives of municipal schools visited the Mayor and the Director of Education, putting forward six demands: (1) Issue two piculs of "respect-teacher rice" to each person; (2) Clear all salary and allowances for this semester in one go; (3) Clear all arrears of in-kind payments or convert them into cash at market prices; (4) Provide rice and non-staple food allowances to normal school students and boarding students in advance; (5) Prepare transportation costs for relocation in the suburbs and north of the Suzhou Creek; (6) Promptly pay water and electricity bills in accordance with Instruction No. 4964. These matters are all reasonable and should be resolved. As for dispersing homeless teachers and students from schools and centralizing the management of students, reasonable arrangements should also be made.</p>
<p>The government should fulfill its responsibilities to teachers; teachers should also hold their positions in education. When we read Daudet's "The Last Lesson," we see how great the teacher's spirit is. Although the situation in Shanghai is sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, and people are in a state of panic, teachers are, after all, leaders of the people. They must calm their hearts, think about our next generation, and attend classes as usual, which is a matter of course. Teaching is a teacher's second life, and there is no room for evasion. When we look at the various acts of rebellion today, educators should think about the fact that education has not been carried out. "When education is carried out, propriety and righteousness will flourish, and customs will be beautiful." Teachers are the ones who implement education. If they do not fulfill their responsibility of "transforming the people and shaping customs," then it will become empty talk. If their minds are filled with gold and US dollars as the most important things, then people will naturally worship "Big Brother" and "Second Brother" as God. Guan Zhong's saying in the Yi Zhi Chapter that "when the granaries are full, people know etiquette; when food and clothing are sufficient, people know honor and disgrace" refers to ordinary people, not teachers. A teacher "seeks the Way, not food." He should be like the great master Dong Zhongshu of the Western Han Dynasty, "rectify his righteousness, not seek his benefit, clarify his Dao, not calculate his merit." Master Wang Chuanshan elaborated on the order of food, clothing, integrity, and shame: "To say that integrity and shame arise after food and clothing are sufficient, and that ritual and righteousness are created after wealth and goods are abundant, is to grasp the symptoms and seek the root... " This kind of teacher spirit, which has been obtained and lost again, must be found back. Going to school and attending classes is a responsibility of conscience, and it is what children and young people are begging for, ahead of teachers.</p>
<p>Today, the psychology of young students is like that during the National Revolution in 1926. If there is proper autonomy and effort in one's position, not only will one not suffer, but the school will also benefit greatly. However, young students, full of youthful energy, have witnessed the corruption of officials and the distress of the people, and have forgotten their own stand. They do not know that studying is a student's duty, and they frequently go on strike, creating an unprecedented chaotic phenomenon in the education field. If this continues without finding a way to correct it, then the future of the second generation is truly worrying. How can we hope that the youth of the future will accomplish great things and establish great careers with people who are ignorant and unskilled? Listening to the words of teachers and following the teachings of sages will benefit them endlessly throughout their lives. Righteous teachers will never lead you to burn incense in a temple without a Buddha. All the students are the future talents of the nation, and we must treat these formidable youths with a responsible attitude and find the hope of a newly emerging China in them.</p>
<p>The current situation of attending classes in various schools is too bad. Sometimes there are few teachers and many students, sometimes there are few students and many teachers, and sometimes teachers have nothing to do all day long because there are no students to teach, or students wander around the school and have no classes to attend all day long. This is indeed because everyone is busy moving and fleeing, or worrying about the vague future, or because the heavy burden of life is overwhelming. It is a matter of pity, and there is a reason for it. But how can this state of affairs be allowed to continue? It is not a blessing for young children! We have already spoken to the government, teachers, and students. Now, we would like to ask the society to take responsibility for educating the next generation. Parents and members of society should urge their children to attend school or transfer to another school as usual, and strictly educate and supervise them, not allowing them to idle around and do nothing. At the same time, we hope that they will help schools and teachers solve the difficulties that the government cannot solve, or at least not increase their difficulties. Paying tens of thousands of dollars in administrative fees makes the school's finances difficult by a hundred thousand times, in order to alleviate the immediate crisis and save education from collapse. Without the fact of school closures, do not issue news of school closures, disturbing teachers and students and causing them to be demoralized. The resolution of the meeting of municipal secondary and higher education principals this time is: "Please ask the Education Bureau to send letters to all daily and evening newspapers in the city, stating that any news about school closures must be released after obtaining the press release issued by the Education Bureau." This is worth noting. In short, education is a matter for the country and also a matter for society. Please everyone respect this sacred cause together!</p>
<h3 id="e28">Jessup and Malik Meet Again - The Berlin Blockade Can Be Lifted Immediately - The Date of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is Still to be Agreed <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, broadcast on the 3rd: If Malik accepts Jessup's invitation, the four powers will discuss the lifting of the Berlin blockade and the date for convening a four-power foreign ministers' conference today. It is reported that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have reached an agreement on the procedure for lifting the blockade and convening a four-power conference. The four powers have now agreed to hold a foreign ministers' conference in Paris, but the date for lifting the blockade and convening the Paris conference is still to be discussed and decided. The three Western powers have suggested convening the foreign ministers' conference on May 23. It is reported that Malik suggested lifting all restrictions on a certain day within the second week of June. The three Western powers hope to designate May 9 as the day when the four powers simultaneously lift all obstacles set up by both sides since March 26, 1948. It is reported that the Soviet Union suggested that both sides simultaneously lift all restrictions one week before the convening of the foreign ministers' conference. If today's meeting can be held as scheduled, it is expected that the representatives of the four powers will simultaneously discuss the issuance of a communique by the four powers, announcing the decision of the four powers to resume negotiations on the German issue. Regarding whether Malik has the authority to directly decide on the agreement on various dates, or whether he must ask Moscow for instructions on the Western proposal before making a decision, London officials cannot determine at this moment.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 3rd] It is expected that the three Western powers will submit to the Soviet Union a plan to end the Berlin blockade by the end of this week on the 3rd. Diplomatic sources said that if the Soviet Union accepts the above plan, then the Berlin blockade and counter-blockade will be lifted from May 11 to 14, and the four-power conference will be convened in Paris around May 25. According to the well-informed sources, the above plan will be submitted by Jessup, the United States Ambassador-at-Large, to Malik, the chief representative of the Soviet Union at the United Nations. The above plan was drafted by Jessup, Cadogan, the United Nations representative of the United Kingdom, and Chauvel, the representative of France, on the 2nd. It is reported that the Western proposal includes the following points: (1) Jessup, Cadogan, and Chauvel are prepared to start four-power negotiations here with Malik "at any time in the next few days." After February 15, Jessup and Malik had already started direct negotiations on the Berlin issue. (2) The Western countries support the simultaneous lifting of the Berlin Soviet blockade and the Western counter-blockade next week. (3) The Western countries agree to decide on the date of the four-power foreign ministers' conference to be convened in Paris to discuss the German issue, which will be held in about two weeks.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 2nd] The US representative Jessup met with the British representative Cadogan and the French representative Chauvel for about an hour today to discuss and determine a common attitude towards the conditions for lifting the Berlin blockade proposed by the Soviet Union. After the meeting, the representatives of the three countries issued a communique stating that the discussion "progressed smoothly," but it was not stated whether the opinions of the three countries were consistent. In general, it still awaits final approval from the governments of each country. A spokesman for the US delegation said that there would be no contact with the Soviet representative Malik until Wednesday to submit the written reply from the three countries. Jessup went to Washington at the end of last week to report on the progress of the negotiations to Secretary of State Acheson, and after meeting with Acheson in the morning today, he took a plane to this place to convene a meeting of the three countries. According to reliable sources, Jessup will be able to meet with Malik in one or two days, at which time the final decision on the lifting of the Berlin blockade can be made. The full text of the communique of today's meeting of the three countries reads, "Since the start of the negotiations between Jessup and Malik, the British and French representatives have received full reports at any time. The representatives of the three Western countries also meet from time to time to exchange views on the progress of these informal negotiations. Today's meeting is just one of them. Each four-power negotiation requires a considerable amount of time, and this one is no exception, especially since the capitals of three of them are far away. What can be said is that the negotiations are proceeding satisfactorily, as on Friday night. However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, the content of today's discussion is not convenient to publish in advance."</p>
<h3 id="e29">The US, UK, and France Have a Consistent Position - Willing to Cooperate with the Soviet Union to Solve the German Problem - New Negotiations Should Be Based on the New Situation <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] Sources said that the US representative Jessup and the Soviet representative Malik are drafting a communique on the lifting of the Berlin blockade and the convening of a four-power conference, and its contents have not yet been submitted to the British and French governments. People here emphasized that the United States, Britain, and France have a consistent position on the German issue. It is reported that the main point that remains to be decided at present is the date of the four-power conference. The Western powers have suggested holding this conference on May 15, while the Soviet Union supports holding it on June 15. French Foreign Minister Schuman also confirmed today that the Soviet Union has accepted the preliminary conditions put forward by the Western countries for resuming four-power negotiations, and the four parties have reached an agreement on convening a four-power conference.</p>
<p>Schuman denied the rumors that Britain, France, and the United States had different opinions on handling this matter. Senior diplomatic figures here believe that when Acheson discussed the Soviet Union's attempt to resolve the Berlin issue with Bevin and Schuman in Washington last month, the opinions of the three men were completely aligned. The United States authorized Jessup to conduct detailed discussions with Malik only after the three powers reached an agreement. It is reported that the opinions of the United States, Britain, and France are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The Potsdam Agreement Has Expired - The West Holds the Trump Card</p>
<p>Since the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviet Union has adopted a defensive stance for the first time, and it is the turn of the Western countries to take the initiative for the first time. The three countries believe that the Berlin blockade and the Western countries' emphasis on the counter-blockade of East Germany and Eastern Europe have forced the Soviet Union to tend to compromise in the Cold War. It is generally expected that at the upcoming four-power conference, the Soviet Union will propose a decisive plan, demanding the immediate restoration of Germany's unification and the withdrawal of all occupying forces. The Western countries will answer that the withdrawal of troops must wait until the peace treaty is signed. The three powers are willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union to promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. At the same time, the three powers will also declare that the Potsdam Agreement has expired, and the new negotiations of the four powers should be based on the new situation, especially on the agreement on West Germany established by the three powers in Washington. For this reason, if the Soviet Union attempts to invoke the Potsdam Agreement, it will inevitably be rejected by the three powers. The three Western powers will welcome the Soviet Union to put forward suggestions so that East Germany can also be merged with the rest of Germany based on the Bonn Constitution. At the same time, the three Western powers will also declare to the Soviet Union that the merger of East Germany with the rest of Germany should be conditional on the existence of democratic conditions in East Germany, such as holding free elections, abolishing the secret police, freedom of speech, free activities for various political parties, and joint supervision by the Allied countries of the implementation of the aforementioned conditions. Western observers predict that the Soviet Union will reject these conditions regarding East Germany. If East Germany cannot be merged with West Germany, then the Western allies may suggest establishing some kind of bridge between East and West Germany. This bridge will be a liaison committee organized purely by Germans in Berlin to handle relations between East and West Germany, especially economic relations. If, unexpectedly, the Soviet Union can agree to the conditions regarding East Germany, it would indeed be one of the greatest victories of the Western countries after the war. Otherwise, if the Berlin Liaison Committee is established, it can at least enable the Western countries to gain a foothold in an area completely controlled by the Soviet Union. In short, as the German issue has developed to this point, it seems that the Western countries hold the trump card in the upcoming four-power negotiations.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, broadcast on the 3rd: The agenda of the meeting of the foreign ministers of ten European countries to discuss the European Parliament has changed suddenly today. The issue of Turkey and Greece joining the European Parliament, which was originally scheduled to be discussed on the 3rd, may now be changed to the 4th. It is reported that this change is partly because Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak will not be able to arrive in London until the 4th. The foreign ministers of the ten countries will proceed to discuss the draft regulations of the European Parliament on the 3rd. It is generally hoped that all outstanding issues will be resolved quickly so that the draft regulations can be signed on the 4th or 5th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] The foreign ministers of ten European countries held a meeting in St. James's Palace today to plan the organization of the European Parliament. The ten countries are the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, and Italy. They will decide on the charter of the new institution based on the suggestions of the ambassadors of the ten countries recently drafted in London for organizing the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The European Parliament is divided into two parts: the European Parliament and the Committee of Ministers, which were decided to be initiated by the Western European Union Advisory Committee at a meeting in January. This meeting of the foreign ministers of ten countries is chaired by British Foreign Minister Bevin and is expected to last about two to three days. French Foreign Minister Schuman and Italian Foreign Minister Sforza both expressed their satisfaction with the achievements of this conference. Schuman said when he arrived at Victoria Station in London yesterday, "I am very pleased to be here to sign the 'European Charter' with my colleagues from the nine countries. I believe that this is a very important event in the process of international peace and progress." Sforza also said when he got off the train, "I have never been more optimistic about the mission of signing a treaty on any previous trip abroad. We are now truly taking on the mission of organizing Europe."</p>

The interference has become more severe recently, and the US side believes that the Soviet authorities are trying to deceive the people and prevent them from knowing about the negotiations to lift the Berlin blockade.

<p>[United Press, Boston, 2nd] Wallace declared today that the United States should "engage in commerce" with the Chinese Communist Party. Wallace, who is scheduled to address a Progressive Party meeting tonight, told reporters that Communist China will become a threat unless "we correct our errors." Wallace explained that the "errors" he referred to were the methods used by Truman, Churchill, and Vandenberg in handling world problems. Wallace further stated, "If we feel that the way to handle the situation in China is to isolate or suppress them by not engaging in commerce with them, then I can anticipate that Communist China will come up with a method that is infinitely harmful. I personally feel, and have heard many businessmen say, that we can and should engage in commerce with the CCP. If we refuse to engage in commerce with half the world, we will become impoverished. The United States will trade with China unless there are fools at the top levels of the CCP who interfere politically. Otherwise, they will also trade with us. Our understanding and assistance can stabilize China." Wallace also claimed that the North Atlantic Treaty will lead to war, and the Soviets have opened a path to peace in Berlin, which the United States must follow. "We must build a stronger United Nations on the basis of cooperation among the great powers."</p>

<p>[Our Report] London, 3rd Broadcast: The British Commonwealth Prime Ministers unanimously agreed at an informal meeting that Burma must receive economic aid to stabilize its chaotic domestic situation. However, Burma must accept the Commonwealth's mediation of the conflict between the country and the Karen people as a prerequisite for receiving this aid.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] Indian Prime Minister Nehru had a private dinner with British Foreign Secretary Bevin this afternoon. The details have not been announced, but it is believed that the two discussed the future of Burma. During last week's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, Nehru raised this issue for Burma. Officials stated that Burma is an independent sovereign state not connected to the Commonwealth, so all policies related to Burma must be decided by the Foreign Office.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd] Indian Prime Minister Nehru left here for Bern, Switzerland today. Those who went to the airport to see him off included his sister, Madame Pandit, the Indian High Commissioner to Britain, the Indian Ambassador to Burma, and Indian expatriates. Nehru wore a light brown coat, a light blue single-breasted suit, and a long black cigarette holder. He told reporters that he was very pleased that satisfactory solutions were reached to the issues discussed during his visit. He believes that the Commonwealth will become stronger after reducing its strict regulations and is very grateful for the hospitality of all parties.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] The British Foreign Office confirmed today that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers discussed the issue of aid to Burma at an informal meeting last week.

The issue of aid to Burma was discussed at the New Delhi Conference in March of this year, but no resolution was reached when the conference adjourned. Subsequently, the issue of aid to Burma was still under consideration and was raised for discussion by the relevant prime ministers at the Commonwealth Conference held in London last week. At the same time, it was heard that most of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers agreed that the Burmese government under Thakin Nu must have funds to prevent its collapse. It was also agreed at the time that the Commonwealth should provide loans to Burma, but the method and amount of the loans would be decided after the Prime Ministers of India, Pakistan, and Ceylon returned to their respective capitals.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Legislative Procedures in the United States Congress <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— By Bateman</p>
<p>During a typical session of the United States Congress, thousands of bills are introduced. To cope with this workload and to properly review each proposal, Congress has established a legislative structure through which all bills must pass before becoming law.</p>
<p>When a proposed law reaches the House of Representatives or the Senate for consideration and voting by all members, it has already undergone thorough consideration to determine whether there is a need to enact it into law, whether the original proposal is appropriate and feasible, and whether it reflects the will of the voters. Typically, its content has been studied by experts inside and outside the government, and the opinions of relevant individuals or groups have been heard and recorded. It has been reviewed or amended by a committee of legislators who are quite familiar with a particular area.</p>
<p>In the previous 75 sessions (note that the current new Congress is the 81st), more than 725,000 bills were introduced. Mainly due to the selective measures inherited by the legislative structure, on average, only one out of every twelve bills becomes law. Most of the bills that are not passed are withdrawn before reaching the general debate in Congress.</p>
<p>Suggestions for legislation often originate outside of Capitol Hill, where Congress is located. A large proportion of bills are the result of requests from the government's administrative agencies. In his annual message to Congress, the President will invariably propose several laws that he considers to be of utmost importance to the welfare of the nation. Each administrative department also proposes some legislative plans in its respective area. Business organizations, consumer groups, labor unions, and agricultural associations also bring their needs to the attention of Congress by maintaining contact with senators and representatives. The same is true for individuals. Many bills are generated by a single legislator or a congressional committee's independent investigation.</p>
<p>In many integrations, preliminary research is conducted before the bill is drafted. Once a bill is drafted, the next step is for a member of the Senate or House to introduce it in a plenary session. The degree of preliminary research varies. It is usually directly proportional to the importance of the bill's subject matter and the number of people and interests involved.</p>
<p>Taking the Marshall Plan as an example, experts from the State Department first conducted extensive research on the proposed European Recovery Program as a preliminary step before Secretary of State Marshall presented his views to the nation in a speech at the Harvard University commencement ceremony.</p>
<p>Later, due to positive public reaction, the entire government apparatus was used to conduct thorough research and investigation. The State Department completed a basic document on all aspects of the plan, "The Outline of European Recovery," which included a draft plan to be submitted to Congress. In addition, a "Harriman Committee" appointed by the President, chaired by Averell Harriman, the current roving ambassador to the Marshall Plan countries, and including financiers, industrialists, private economists, and production experts, presented an exploratory study estimating the needs of the Marshall Plan countries. Two other groups appointed by the President prepared detailed reports totaling one million words on the impact of these needs on the American economy and natural resources.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives, in view of the great significance of the aid to Europe plan, took further action. Before the bill was submitted for public review, a sixteen-member subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Congressman Herter, traveled to Europe to conduct on-site investigations.</p>
<p>Such intensive preparation is only carried out for very important legislation. Ordinary preliminary investigations are less extensive and are conducted by standing committees appointed by the Speaker of the House or the President of the Senate. Standing committees are central to the legislative process. They are each chaired by a member of the majority party in Congress. The minority party members have a certain proportion of the committee seats, and they are led by the senator or representative with the highest seniority. There are fifteen standing committees in the Senate and nineteen in the House, each responsible for a specific area, including appropriations, agriculture, military affairs, public lands, veterans' affairs, banking and currency, and foreign affairs. The task of the committees is to separate appropriate and inappropriate bills and to draft the bills presented in a more appropriate manner. The fundamental method of investigation is public consultation, with relevant individuals attending to present their views.</p>
<p>A bill may be passed in the committee as it is, or it may be slightly amended or shelved. Shelving often cancels a bill unless a group of congressmen who have proposed the bill in the House vote to force the committee to submit the bill to the whole House for discussion.</p>
<p>Many bills are introduced by the committees themselves. As long as the committee members believe there is a need to enact a law, they can take action. In the previous session of Congress, a subcommittee of the Senate traveled across the country to investigate opinions on housing conditions in various cities, and the information obtained was used as the basis for the housing laws passed by the 80th Congress.</p>
<p>After a bill has been reviewed by a committee and is deemed ready for consideration by all members, it is placed on the legislative calendar for a full debate. All bills must be approved by both houses before becoming law. Often, a proposed measure is passed by one house but rejected by the other, as was the case with the Marshall Plan bill. When this happens, a conference committee composed of members from both houses is selected to study the differences between the two houses and draft an acceptable bill for further consideration and passage by both houses.</p>
<p>Once a bill is approved by Congress, it has passed the final stage of the preliminary sequence. It is printed on parchment and reviewed by the chairmen of the relevant committees of the Senate and House to certify that it is completely correct. After the Speakers of the Senate and House sign the parchment, it is sent to the President for his signature.</p>
<p>If the bill is vetoed by the President, then both houses must reconsider it. But if both houses still pass it with a two-thirds majority, they can override the veto, and the bill can become law without the President's signature. (Translated by the U.S. Information Service)</p>

<p>Today Huamei Plays Lian Zhan Youyi Post Affairs</p>
<p>In the four-time table tennis league, the four Huamei teams played against Qinglian at the Postal Affairs Ball Room the night before. The strength of the two sides was very different. Although it was a one-sided situation, there were still more than 100 spectators. Huamei dismounted and showed its power. Lu Hanjun easily took Li Peiran in two straight sets. Wang Jiuqing used gentleness to overcome strength and defeated the opponent's captain Liu Baotai by two to one. Qinglian was at a loss and the counterattack was ineffective. Tu Youci and Wang Zongze were also attacked by Huamei's Li Zongpei and Qin Duyan. In the last set, Qinglian's Cao Taichang made a mistake, and as a result, Huamei defeated Qinglian by five straight sets. Today (4th), there will be two Grade A matches and four Grade B matches. Huamei will play Lian Zhan Youyi and Post Affairs. Youyi is not Huamei's opponent. Post Affairs' performance in this session has been mediocre, but if good players such as Liu Zaoshi, Wang Huizhang, and Jiang Chunshan can go all out, they can compete with Huamei.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's gold market saw people feeling weak after the garrison headquarters announced the recall of money shop bank drafts. Factories urgently needed funds to pay wages, leading to a large amount of physical gold flowing out. The supply was strong, and the demand was weak. Buyers were scarce.

Only a few had completed the procedures, obtained licenses, and started buying and selling, all in cash transactions. Bank draft transactions were mostly rejected. Silver dollars (Big Heads) initially traded at 3.7 million to 4 million, gradually falling to 3.4 million to 3.6 million. There was not much fluctuation in the afternoon, and in the evening they were shouted at 3.4 million to 3.7 million. Bank draft transactions initially traded at 6.5 million to 7.5 million, and the final price was shouted at 5 million to 5.5 million, gradually approaching cash prices. Due to the authorities' increased efforts to catch silver touts, street touting had gone underground, and their movements were erratic, making the streets quieter.</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold and silver exchange rate on the stock exchange initially traded at 36 to 39 for the 6th and 7th floors, close to noon it was 34 to 37, and in the afternoon it was 35 to 38.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the Chinese stock market, there was still a market without transactions in the trading room yesterday. All stocks were called out, opening at the upper limit price, but there were no transactions before or after the market. After the sudden turn in the current situation, the price trends of various off-market goods moved in line with gold and silver. The price fluctuations of Chinese stocks in the trading room were restricted, unable to keep up, and the off-market shouting price had risen in a straight line, with a large gap. Therefore, transactions could not be carried out. The off-market trend slightly weakened yesterday. Because commercial and bank drafts were about to be recalled, credit turnover in the market gradually tightened, and the general trend of money market was generally viewed as tight, so financial goods fell first yesterday, and other prices also showed weakness.

<p>Yesterday, cotton yarn weakened due to tight money market, weak sentiment, low gold prices outside of the exchange, and a decline in all goods. At noon, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn retreated to 9.5 million yuan, down 19 million yuan from yesterday. 40-count and 32-count yarns were down by 10 million to 20 million yuan respectively. 21-count Double Horse stack notes were down 16 million yuan, and spot goods were down 14.5 million yuan. All yarns below 20 counts weakened.</p>
<p>The shouting price of cotton cloth outside of the exchange fluctuated. Leading fine cloth and Four Gentlemen serge still hovered around the four-yuan mark. The shouting price was initially firm, but it softened slightly later, and ultimately fell slightly with the prices of goods outside of the exchange. Spinning and Weaving continued to sell cotton cloth as usual, including trumpet fine cloth, deputy brand serge gray cloth, second-grade gray cloth, jumping carp bleached cloth, Taoyuan floral cloth and 15 other varieties. Due to transportation obstacles and the lack of new orders, street sales were sluggish, resulting in a very depressed sentiment. Although the prices of private factories have been adjusted continuously, very few people were interested.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Hualian ship of the China United Company, which was rented by a certain bank this time to transport employees to Keelung, was scheduled to depart this morning. Yesterday, it was docked at Pier No. 2 of the Taikoo Company on the Bund, Zhongshan East 2nd Road. Passengers and luggage were boarding the ship, but at approximately 3:30 PM, smoke suddenly billowed from the chimney of the ship. Passengers caught sight of the smoke, mistook it for a fire, and fled immediately, causing chaos. The captain reported the situation and immediately raised the flag to request help. The Taikoo Company telegraphed the 16th Precinct Fire Brigade to report the fire, and they rushed to the pier in fire trucks to put out the fire. Upon learning of the incident, the Jianghai Customs Fire Brigade also dispatched the Pujie fireboat to the scene. By the time they arrived at the Hualian ship, the fire had already been extinguished. The fire trucks and boats returned to their stations, and the false alarm was over. Passengers and luggage continued to board the ship, and it was reported that the ship was undamaged and permitted to depart for Taiwan this morning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Huasheng ship of the Huasheng Shipping Company on Sichuan Road, which has a displacement of over 9,000 tons, had its hold fully loaded with luggage, furniture, paint, and other items, and its second deck loaded with personnel, and was docked at Zhanghuabang, preparing to sail to Taiwan. Unexpectedly, on the evening of May 2nd, at 7:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out and burned fiercely. Upon receiving the report, Deng Quansheng, the Harbor Master of Jianghai Customs, immediately ordered the Pujie fireboat to rush from the Customs Wharf at the highest speed to put out the fire. An hour later, the fire was under control, and firefighters wearing smoke masks risked entering the hold to direct their efforts at extinguishing what was still burning until at 11:25 PM when the fire was completely extinguished, fortunately averting a major disaster.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Mayor Chen Discusses General Municipal Facilities: Coal Shortage Expected to Be Resolved, Solutions for Fish and Vegetables Available, Only Rice Monitoring and Two Sources Need to Be Unimpeded, Citizens' Livelihood and Survival Can Be Worry-Free <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Today is the second day of the inauguration of the new Shanghai Mayor Chen Liang. Our reporter made a special visit to Mr. Chen and inquired about general municipal facilities. He kindly made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Currently, the most emotionally stirring issue is personnel matters. Prices for public utilities can be adjusted very high, while the salaries of public school teachers and staff are very low, leading to a significant social contradiction. The resulting instability in personnel is most regrettable. Regarding the overall personnel of the municipal government, adjustments are planned to begin immediately and can be decided in a short period. After a decision is made, all administrative matters can be renewed, and we can move forward together.</p>
<p>As for the current situation in Shanghai, due to the strict military deployment and prolonged defense, there is virtually no question that Shanghai will exist forever. The most urgent issue to be resolved now is the coal shortage. Negotiations have been conducted with the Taiwan Provincial Government to exchange flour, gauze, and daily necessities for Taiwanese coal. Chairman Chen has agreed to allocate 40,000 tons per month and has designated Director Situ of the Taiwan Materials Adjustment Committee to be responsible for handling it. However, the city's monthly coal consumption must reach 100,000 tons. An additional 30,000 tons have been requested from the Taiwan Provincial Government. It has now been decided that the Coal Adjustment Association, Central Trust Bureau, and the Four Mines Joint Management Office will be limited to exchanging 100,000 bolts of cloth, each bolt for one ton of coal, totaling 100,000 tons, within two weeks. Additionally, the Central Bank has been requested to urgently purchase and store 50,000 tons. This will completely alleviate the coal shortage in the future.</p>
<p>Plan to Grow Vegetables on Garden Roofs</p>
<p>With the fuel problem resolved, all production and water and electricity supply will naturally be sufficient. In terms of food, if meat is lacking, fish can be substituted. The city is close to rivers and seas, with abundant fish resources, and fish is more nutritious than meat. Regarding vegetables, in case river transport is blocked, private gardens and open spaces in the city can be opened up for vegetable cultivation. Even private rooftops can be utilized. Agricultural experts have been asked to draft a plan, which will be enforced once it is finalized.</p>
<p>In summary, as long as the two sources of rice monitoring are unblocked in Shanghai today, all livelihood problems can be self-sufficiently and completely resolved. The lives and survival of citizens will be worry-free. Coupled with military coordination, Shanghai will be an impregnable fortress.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] Mayor Chen Liang also told reporters: Zhao Banfu, Acting Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, has been approved to resign. The vacant position has been officially reassigned to Chen Baotai. Furthermore, Qian Jianfu, Deputy Director and Acting Director of the city's Finance Bureau, although only acting for a month, has put great effort into reorganizing tax revenue and raising funds, especially in the timely payment of public school teachers and staff salaries. However, due to current difficulties, he has repeatedly requested to resign from his acting position. It has been reported that Mayor Chen has approved it. However, Mr. Chen still highly values Acting Director Qian and has transferred him to Deputy General Manager of the City Bank so that he can continue to assist the city's finances. The new Director of the Finance Bureau has also been announced as Wang Weiheng. Mr. Wang previously served as Deputy Director of the Quartermaster General Headquarters for a long time. He recently transferred to Shanghai from Taiwan and served as Deputy Commander of the Second Supply District. Having been in charge of military supplies for a long time, he is known as an expert in financial management. In the future, the city's finances will surely enter a new phase.</p>

<p>[East China News Agency] Due to the sharp rise in the public utility valuation index in the city's public utility and transportation sectors in recent days, the calculated selling prices have soared accordingly, greatly threatening the livelihood of citizens. Public school teachers and staff and salaried classes in general are unable to bear the burden. The mayor received reports of blame from all parties and was very concerned. He ordered the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to advise various public utility companies to consider the burden on citizens and try to maintain the status quo as much as possible. It is heard that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, after receiving instructions from Mayor Chen yesterday, has decided to reduce the public utility valuation index as much as possible in the future. The public utility valuation index calculated by the various public utility companies reached 1.25 million times, which was reduced by Mayor Chen to 890,000 times.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Glimpses of the Hong Kong Gold Rush <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Leng Zheqi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 22nd Flight News] Regarding the "Gold Rush" in Hong Kong, after many speculations during the Easter holiday, things became clear after the holiday on the 18th of this month. The following points are noted:</p>
<p>(1) The Hong Kong government has not yet purchased gold. According to its spokesperson, "If the government wants to buy gold, it can buy it from South Africa, which is even cheaper."</p>
<p>(2) Bank private safe deposit boxes have not been searched, but individuals storing gold should register with the government.</p>
<p>(3) The Hong Kong government limits the purchase of jewelry by the public to no more than three taels. Purchasers must leave their address. 95 gold or 22K gold can circulate freely.</p>
<p>(4) Rumors of the devaluation of the British pound are still rife in the market. The black market exchange rate for the US dollar has risen from HK$5.30 to around HK$5.80 per dollar.</p>
<p>(5) The Portuguese currency in Macau has also risen. One Hong Kong dollar is only worth about 7.5 Portuguese patacas, compared to about 8 patacas in the past.</p>
<p>(6) Each Yuan Shikai silver dollar is worth about HK$5.80, compared to about HK$4 in the past.</p>
<p>(7) Hong Kong and Chinese jewelry today costs around HK$380 per tael to sell and HK$340 to buy. In the past (before the gold rush), it was only worth around HK$320.</p>
<p>(8) The entire city is shifting its position to Macau.</p>
<p>(9) Not only is the financial market rising, but the commodity market is also fluctuating. Raw peanuts, with up to 20,000 pieces per day, were only about 63.4 yuan in the early morning of the 18th, but then gradually closed higher and stopped selling cheaply. Various types of beans, taking advantage of scarcity, have been rising in price. The flour market, which was originally the most sluggish, also followed suit yesterday. Sarsky flour in Hong Kong costs 14 yuan, and those with export permits have risen from 17.2 yuan to 17.4 yuan. The Western medicine market is also in full swing, with lung injections, penicillin injections, dantu lien, and star do mycin, among others, all rising in price. Gauze has risen the most sharply. Various colored white cloths have risen by 1.2 yuan per bolt. 20-count yarn has risen by 20 to 30 yuan per bag, and 42-count yarn has risen by 6.70 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Pearl of the Orient: Food and Housing in Hong Kong <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[Hong Kong, 26th - Airmail] Everyone has heard the saying: "Live in Hangzhou, die in Liuzhou, eat in Guangzhou!" Nobody has ever said "Eat in Hong Kong," even though Hong Kong is geographically only separated from Guangzhou by a strip of water.</p>
<p>Because of this, it's a little difficult for me to talk about food and drink in Hong Kong; but wait, as the saying goes: "Good things can be praised, and bad things can be criticized!" So, even if I risk being accused of writing a rambling article, I can still talk about it for a while.</p>
<p>As I said above, Hong Kong is not a place known for its food and drink. In other words, Hongkongers simply don't have a "eat only the finest, slice only the thinnest" kind of demand. Therefore, besides the government-priced rice which is frequently in short supply, the government-priced bread at four dimes a pound and the government-priced biscuits at one dollar a pound, have become the "specialty foods" here!</p>
<p>Hearing this, perhaps some genuine Hongkongers will think that my words are close to being harsh and insulting to their dignity. They will certainly protest: "You can't say that, don't you see the tea houses, restaurants, eateries… as numerous as one building every five steps, a pavilion every ten steps? And haven't you seen those banquets that cost three or five hundred dollars a table, ordered in large quantities by diners every day?" But, to such questions, I can immediately offer a rebuttal: is that what you call understanding food? Does all this prove that Hongkongers value "eating" very much? No! The reason why Hongkongers go to big restaurants, why they order a table of dishes costing three or five hundred dollars, is often just to save "face" and eat for the "grand scene." Where would you find a "fool" who doesn't mind spending large amounts of money to seek out delicious food? As for those who go to tea houses several times a day for the sake of "socializing," you would be wrong to say they are gluttonous!</p>
<p>However, here, true gourmets and "discerning" diners are not entirely absent. In ordinary times, we see many people "risking" going to places like Shau Kei Wan to eat their "Sam Luk" (a local delicacy); in Wan Chai, Dunqiu Square, Jiao Gong Street, under the banyan tree… we also occasionally see some smartly dressed people, picking their teeth, squatting in front of the beef offal stalls, savoring the sea snails! However, these are really just the minority.</p>
<p>Here, the majority of people ultimately take pride in eating Western food. As a result, influenced by this trend, coffee and black tea have taken the place of "Pu'er" and "Longjing"; and they have replaced sausage rolls and char siu buns. What's even more interesting is that some people, when they come here, even stop preserving the "national essence" of having "one pot and two pieces" every morning, and compete to drink coffee instead!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Cantonese people can eat anything! Be it snake, rat, or insect, they "wipe it out" all the same! Hongkongers naturally retain this habit, so the hawkers selling "beef offal" are as numerous as police officers standing guard at their posts. You can find one or two such food stalls almost every street and alley you walk through. Its fragrant aroma, plus the colored livers, are very tempting. Almost eight out of ten ordinary citizens here are fond of these things. They call this snack and herbal tea "Coca-Cola" at the same time. I remember a poet from another place who came here for the first time, and when he walked down the street, he caught sight of these "beef offal" and was so frightened that he widened his eyes and asked someone: "Is this for eating? Are they human organs?" Speaking of human meat, it would be forced and strange if it were also sold here. But, if there really is such a gourmet who wants to taste the weird taste of human meat, then I can also introduce you: please take out five dollars and walk around Sontonqiu Square. If you live in Kowloon, you might as well move to Rongshu Head. This way, you can get a taste of it! (Forgive me for digressing a bit, but I have to explain: this is also a kind of "eating in Hong Kong"!)</p>
<p>Anyone who has lived in Hong Kong for some time knows that there is a cross street in Wan Chai commonly known as "Glutton Street". Since it is called "Glutton," wouldn't my statement above that Hong Kong is not particular about food and drink be unbelievable? But, I have to tell you that the connotation of the two words "Glutton" is originally just: eat a meal regardless of whether it is good or bad!</p>
<p>Why are Hongkongers less particular about food and drink than people in Guangzhou?</p>
<p>The reason is very simple: because Hong Kong is a place where it is not easy to find food!</p>
<p>Below, let's talk about the situation of living here.</p>
<p>"The Pearl of the Orient," this is an honorary title belonging to Hong Kong. Yes, there are neat streets, lush mountain scenery, plus a climate that is like spring all year round. So, in the eyes of some people, isn't it a "pearl" in the "palm"?</p>
<p>Then, some people who have not been here may think this way: it must be very comfortable? But, the truth is not so! Just think, this place is only a little over twenty miles in circumference, but it is crammed with nearly 1.8 million people - listen clearly, 1.8 million! How can life be comfortable!</p>
<p>Naturally, these are all about the situation of ordinary citizens. There is a saying here that goes: "If you have money, live upstairs, if you don't, live on the ground and be a rascal." So, besides the more "rascals" living on the ground, there are also people who live comfortably "upstairs."</p>
<p>The buildings in Hong Kong have a feature that is different from other places, that is: general residential buildings are mostly built in the same style. Saying that the houses here are "pigeon coops!" I really admire the cleverness of the person who created this adjective. Please close your eyes and think: when you are crossing the sea here by ferry, aren't rows of "pigeon coops" clearly displayed in front of you? Look, how vivid the two words "pigeon coop" are!</p>
<p>If someone asks: how many people can live in such a "pigeon coop"? Then, let's calculate now. If this building has four floors, each floor has four rooms, and two beds (in fact, many beds are divided into upper and lower bunks, a total of four or six!), an average of six people, big and small, live in a room, and an average of two people sleep in a bed. In this way, a "pigeon coop" can accommodate 112 people! (Please don't underestimate this number. In the army, with this number, it is enough to form a complete "company." Moreover, in many small villages in the mainland, there are not so many people in a village!)</p>
<p>Looking at this situation, saying that the house is a "pigeon coop" is just to describe its appearance. As for its contents, if I were to find a concrete thing to compare it to, I think only a "sardine can" is qualified.</p>
<p>So many people are squeezed into a house. Logically speaking, it should be very lively, right? However, I don't know why the people here seem to have all contracted a kind of "don't want to associate with each other" attitude. Although everyone lives in the same building, the people on the second floor often don't know the surname of the people on the third floor, and the people in the first room don't know what kind of occupation the people in the last room have. They meet each other several times a day, but they never nod. If someone calls out "Good morning!" to the other party, it may immediately lead to a suspicious look and an awkward face. There is a popular ballad here: "The first room laughs, the last room cries, the second floor invites guests to a wedding banquet, the third floor buys a coffin, monsters and gods live in the same house, all kinds of people share the same roof!" These few words truly describe the scene of living together here and the characteristics of "living" in Hong Kong!</p>
<p>It's really not a place to live everywhere here, but it doesn't matter. Hongkongers never worry about the problem of "living," because the life philosophy of Hongkongers is: "It doesn't matter if the home is dirty and cramped, you must be well-dressed when going out." What does it matter if the residence is a little cramped and dirty? Just don't tell your address to strangers!</p>
<p>There is another big feature of "living" here, so let's talk about it here. The second landlords here are especially famous. Everyone knows the name "landlady"! In some novels, plays, or newspaper cartoons, we often see their appearance and figure, so there is really no need for me to introduce them again. But, some people may ask: why have we never heard of the name "landlord"? Are all landlords widows or spinsters? Answer: no. The reason is that the second landlords here mostly adopt the "presidential vacancy system," so the power falls into the "responsible cabinet" of the Prime Minister, and it is not accidental that it deserves its name!</p>
<p>"Keep for food, not for lodging"! "Every inch of land is worth an ounce of gold"! These are words that can often be heard here. The ancients said: "It is not easy to live in Chang'an". Judging from this, it is "not easy to live" everywhere here!</p>
<h3 id="e93">Tragedy of Anti-Chinese Sentiment in Malaya: Interview with Distressed Overseas Chinese Repatriated to Shantou <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Ruirui</p>
<p>[Shantou, this newspaper, 1st – Airmail] Two batches of distressed overseas Chinese who were repatriated from Malaya have been transferred by boat and arrived in Shantou. They were all concentrated and sent from Singapore. After being imprisoned for more than half a year, this large group of distressed overseas Chinese finally gained freedom and were deported. Their tragic experiences and the vicious means used in the anti-Chinese tragedy staged in Malaya are chilling. When this reporter inspected the "Distressed Overseas Chinese Reception Center" and conducted interviews, they all talked endlessly about the beginning and end of this tragic and desolate incident.</p>
<p>The anti-Chinese movement in Malaya has been deteriorating since last year. By June, the British government in Malaya promulgated the "Emergency Ordinance". Every member of the political department or secret agent was granted great power. They could arbitrarily arrest people they considered "guilty" or should arrest, without any actual evidence. The anti-Chinese action reached a fever pitch as a result. These secret agents and special agents who were charged with missions ran rampant everywhere, extorting money by taking advantage of their power, taking revenge on personal grudges, and making arrests indiscriminately to gain merit. The situation in Malaya fell into an unprecedented tragedy.</p>
<p>Although the Malayan government said that the "Emergency Ordinance" was aimed at dealing with "thugs" and stabilizing the local area, it was actually an excuse to deal with overseas Chinese. As a further action to suppress the Chinese, more than 10,000 men, women, old and young have been arrested and detained under the "Emergency Ordinance" in various parts of Malaya for more than half a year. This large group is not thugs, but peace-abiding and good overseas Chinese. In the beginning, fewer people were arrested. A month later, this emergency action spread. The local special agents were unable to suppress the increasingly turbulent situation, but they vented their anger on our innocent compatriots. They even detained all the overseas Chinese men, women, old and young in many cities and villages, regardless of their good or bad behavior, under the pretext of "failure to report information." During this period, some were beaten and raped. After the overseas Chinese were driven out, the houses and property they lived in were burned down. The fire covered the sky. Not only were the hard-earned money of the overseas Chinese for decades reduced to ashes, but some were separated from their wives and children, and their families were destroyed. Among those arrested, the elderly could not move and the young could not speak. Were they also suspected of "riots"?</p>
<p>Under the "emergency" action in Malaya, all the sacrifices were overseas Chinese. The burning atrocities destroyed all the assets of the overseas Chinese. Among them, the areas with the heaviest losses were the vicinity of Beizhou and Fengliandong Road. Nearly 1,000 houses were burned down, and more than 2,000 distressed overseas Chinese were arrested and transferred to Bandi Port. The rest fled in all directions. In Selangor's Kajangjiaojiao Port, more than 60 shops throughout the town were burned down, and more than 1,000 distressed overseas Chinese were arrested. In Shenxiang Island and Quangouwei, Senzhou, more than 1,500 distressed overseas Chinese were arrested. In the areas of Duanluo and Dua Leng in Beizhou, more than 400 houses were burned down, and nearly 1,000 distressed overseas Chinese were arrested. In Maoxian and Yalatop, Jilan Prefecture, more than 200 houses were burned down, dozens of people were injured by bombs, and more than 200 people were arrested. In Selangor's Xingu Mao Rubber Garden, 24 workers were collectively surrounded and massacred. All the shops in Xinlong Town, Perlis State, were burned down. The overseas Chinese in other villages, rubber gardens, factories, and mines in Jinma were brutally abused or unreasonably arrested, often in the thousands. The losses of the overseas Chinese are estimated to be no less than several hundred million dollars. Recently, more than 40 wealthy households have been arrested in the states of Malacca and Johor. Among them, those with assets of up to several million dollars have been accused of sponsoring "thugs" and their property confiscated. All overseas Chinese who have not been harmed by the "Emergency Ordinance" do not have their lives and property guaranteed.</p>
<p>No matter what the excuse is to deal with local thugs, the first to suffer harm are overseas Chinese. After the British government in Malaya burned down, looted, and cleaned out the houses, shops, and property of the overseas Chinese, they detained this large group of arrested</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese were detained and sent to concentration camps on isolated islands. Relatives were not allowed to visit, and all contact with the outside world was cut off, suffering from hunger and humiliation. Some distressed overseas Chinese committed suicide by cutting their abdomens because they could not bear the humiliation of being detained for no reason. Some women also staged a tragic suicide by hanging to show their protest.</p>
<p>As a result of constant "cleansing" and arrests everywhere for more than half a year, all concentration camps are overcrowded. The Malayan government is faced with the problem of how to deal with this group of "suspects". It is impossible to convict the overseas Chinese, and there is no good way to release them. This large group of distressed overseas Chinese had their houses and property burned down, and they had no home to return to and no job to take. Once released, they have no place to go. As a result, they have no choice but to send all the distressed overseas Chinese back to their home country. This is the true face of the Malayan government's anti-Chinese sentiment. When they need them, they welcome the Chinese and recruit them. When they don't need them, they deport them and drive them away.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese, both men and women, old and young, numbering more than 700, who were brought back by Jie Feng and Jie Sheng, generation after generation</p>
<p>were repatriated under these circumstances. Most of them are from the Chaozhou and Meizhou regions, and some are from Guangzhou and Xiamen. Their hard-earned assets, which they had worked so hard for over decades, were reduced to ashes in this disaster. What is left now is a shooter's hand and tattered clothes. Some have been away from their hometown for decades, and their feelings for their hometown have been severed. Some are overseas Chinese students born in foreign countries. Where is home and where to go? If this problem is not properly resolved, they will face the tragic fate of becoming refugees again.</p>
<p>The distressed overseas Chinese who have been repatriated are the first and second batches, accounting for less than one-tenth of the total. There are still tens of thousands of people in "concentration camps" preparing to be "expelled" back. Shantou, this disaster-ridden place, has become a transit port for distressed overseas Chinese to land and be repatriated.</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Overseas Chinese and Indonesia: A Blood Debt is Written <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Manping</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese, who were once hailed as the "Mother of the Revolution," had more or less a taste of "It's our turn to hold our heads high today" on the eve of the end of World War II. However, the cruel reality relentlessly shattered this dream that had been awaited for over thirty years.</p>
<p>If we are not very forgetful, we should remember that during the period when you were running around for the revolution, the overseas Chinese made considerable contributions, both spiritually and materially, to the birth of this child of the millions - the Republic of China. The formation of this patriotic enthusiasm is often not easily understood and is compared to the Japanese-style "mystical patriotism." Some even ridicule it as "Nanyang Bo." In fact, the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese due to their circumstances will never be so simple. Their residence in foreign countries, the exploitation they personally feel, and the various unreasonable stimuli produce this inevitable result - patriotic enthusiasm. It is definitely not something that compatriots in the country can universally understand and feel the same way. This patriotic enthusiasm encourages them to contribute manpower and material resources as much as possible within the possible scope.</p>
<p>"I heard that many people wearing bamboo hats and straw sandals have arrived in a certain port" (Note: This is a term used by overseas Chinese to refer to the National Army). The person who said this looked quite invincible. Not to mention that his own compatriots felt excited about this sentence, even the local natives could not help but have a premonition that "the Hua Bo cannot be offended today." However, all this could not withstand the blow of the ruthless facts. The first thing that made them unable to get by was the second surrender of the Japanese invaders, and the national flag that was raised in the early morning was forcibly lowered immediately for the reason of avoiding misunderstanding. Then came the exploratory test of the Bov-ndoeng fire in March 1946. From this fire test, they achieved considerable success, that is, they learned that our government was not very interested in the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Following the Bov-ndoeng fire, the extremists of the Indonesian revolutionaries, in order to destroy the economic foundation of the overseas Chinese in Java, held an unprecedented massacre in Bonten, using all kinds of methods such as skinning, dismembering, and raping. This tragic and inhuman atrocity has since written a page of indelible blood debt between the two ethnic groups. The Dutch government seized this contradiction and launched the so-called Overseas Chinese Self-Defense Force. Generally, after surviving the ordeal, the compatriots picked up the guns issued by the Dutch government and did indeed make considerable retaliation against the local natives for their family feuds and personal grievances. As a result, these two major ethnic groups blindly deepened this difficult-to-explain hatred under the clever manipulation of Dutch imperialism. As a result, more cruel and thorough burning and killing continued to be staged in various parts of Central and Eastern Java under the control of the natives. Until now, Sumatra is still carrying out that inhumane massacre, and the economic foundation that the overseas Chinese have worked hard to manage for hundreds of years has been destroyed quite thoroughly. What is the use of another set of official-style protests and visits?</p>
<p>Ah! Orphans who have lost the love of their parents! The bloody facts will not be forgotten!</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Due to recent relations with the bureau, a problem has arisen with the food rations of prisoners in the prison department. A total of 72 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for less than 15 years have been approved for bail. Also, Li Ami, the protagonist of the Shanyangban blood case of the previous year, escaped from prison on the 26th and was shot and killed outside the South Gate while being pursued.</p>
