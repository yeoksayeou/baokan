<h3>武漢外圍已趨平靜　鄂省府西遷·東南行署成立</h3>

<p>〔中央社漢口十二日電〕武漢保衛戰自昨日（十一日）國軍配合空軍砲兵將當面之匪擊退後，今日終朝沉寂雙方無接觸，是武漢外園保衛戰序幕戰至此已告一段落。據守備司令部發言人黃聲遠告記者稱：「今日前方無戰事」。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口十二日電〕鄂省府業於昨日西遷，省府東南行署亦於同日正式成立，所有未隨政府西遷人員均在行署辦公，一切工作照常推進。</p>
<h3>鄧文儀發表　最近戰局分析　國軍將予匪嚴重反擊</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十二日電〕國防部政工局長鄧文儀，十二日在記者招待會發表「最近戰局之分析」稱：自共匪破壞和平，發動大規模攻擊以來，已歷三週，共匪軍事企圖已很明顯，約分兩方面，一係以林彪·劉伯承·陳毅三股力量，分三路渡江南犯，一則以聶榮臻·徐向前。彭德懷三部匪軍，向西北攻擊。</p>
<p>目前長江方面，陳毅匪全力約十二個軍，已集結京杭及上海附近，似在積極準備進攻上海。劉伯承匪約九個軍，由皖南南下，已至浙西及贛東北方面，與陳匪相呼應，並作向閩贛進犯之姿態。林彪匪南下主力約六個軍，尚在九江至武漢之間，長江以北，及鄂西北地區，等待長江下游情勢之發展，再向武漢及其東西發動攻勢。</p>
<p>西北聶匪大部進入山西，協助攻陷太原之後，近與徐向前匪一部，分向綏遠及陝西方面進出，彭匪德懷主力已進逼關中，有準備向西安及渭水採取攻勢模樣。</p>
<p>國軍過去因欲誠意謀和，未曾積極從事備戰，故在共匪突然總攻下，太原被迫棄守，南京亦作戰略撤退，雖則該兩處國軍曾受相當損失，但國軍仍保持主力，刻正從事新部署，至適當時機，即將予匪以嚴重反擊。最近一週，長江南北戰局情形，約如左述：</p>
<p>（一）上海方面：共匪陳毅渡江後，即開始對上海地區採取包圍態勢，由江陰一帶渡江之匪，被國軍在崑山太倉地區堅强阻擊，匪軍屢次增援猛撲，均被國軍陸空協同將其擊退，該綫匪軍傷亡已逾二萬人。其迂廻在嘉與之匪一部約五萬，亦遭當地駐防國軍迎頭痛擊，死傷慘重，匪廿三軍損失最重，國軍以任務達成，當於六日改守嘉善附近新防綫，繼續予犯匪以打擊。刻上海外圍防務異常鞏固，兵力亦十分雄厚，地方當局正督促市民儲糧，軍政當局均已决心進行長期保衛戰，國軍勁旅源源到滬，空軍出擊，更予匪軍行動及其運輸交通以重大打擊，刻滬市人心穩定，對外海空通路暢通如恒。</p>
<p>（二）浙贛方面：劉伯承匪軍由皖南波江，直向浙贛路進犯，常山·上饒·南城等地，已被侵佔。陳賡匪部第四兵團，正在東鄉一帶，遭國軍增援部隊猛烈阻擊。南昌國軍亦正準備主動出擊。匪軍一部向鉛山竄擾，圖滲入閩北，同時匪以孤軍深入，補給困難，兵力分散，已逐漸感到困難。</p>
<p>（三）華中方面：鄂北匪軍刻有一部向東移動，圖策應沿浙贛綫進犯之匪，匪四十三軍正由廣濟·黃梅東竄，匪四十軍在孝感以南，其一部於八日竄陷橫店，鄂贛交界之武穴，於七日為土共張體學股千餘竄陷，國軍在武漢三鎮仍有大軍固守。</p>
<h3>贛政治重心移贛縣</h3>
<p>〔中央社贛州十二日電〕省府南遷後，贛縣已成為政治重心，省府各機關首長均已到達，省黨部·省保安司令部·憲兵團等均已遷此，央行亦在此設辦事處，籌備復業。贛縣原有人口不足五萬，現已擁有六萬，街市繁華不减曩者，惟市場拒用金圖券，所有交易均以銀元銀毫為主，四區專員公署雖佈告嚴禁，仍未能收效，一般希望銀元券早日實現，否則公務人員將瀕絕境。</p>
<p>〔中央社贛州十二日電〕省府遷贛後，省務會議今晨首次在此舉行，方天主席正在吉安來贛途中。</p>
<h3>美遠東指揮部發表　現僅東北尚有日軍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十二日電〕美軍遠東指揮部發言人十二日宣稱，現僅中國東北尚有日軍，此外祇有少數失散份子。根據對日勝利日之日軍兵力及東北日僑人數報告，現尚有六萬人留在東北，西伯里亞及庫頁島·千島列島等蘇聯控制地區，尚有四十萬九千人並未遣回。戰事結束後台灣日人四十七萬九千零五十名已全部遣回本國。中國本部已遣回一百五十萬一千一百二十人，除少數濕泊份子外，此為投降時在華日人之總數，據華北中共區消息，曾有一部份日人投入共軍，但其數目無多。</p>
<h3>台省參駐會决議　不墊付中央經費</h3>
<p>要求將存金及物資撥用</p>
<p>〔中央社台北十二日電〕台省參議會曾於九日及十一日分別邀請台省金融經濟專家，及全體省參議員，舉行金融經濟問題座談會，討論「穩定台幣幣值問題」，其中對於台省府墊付中央駐台機關經費一事，曾有熱烈討論，决定「請中央准將存台黃金及物資撥交台灣銀行運用或拋售，以充中央駐台各機關經費，毋須省庫代墊，以免刺瀲台幣膨脹，影響民生」。該會復於十二日召開駐會委員會，亦曾詳論此事，一致議决致電李代總統，行政院長何應欽，監察院長于右任，立法院長童冠賢，及財政部長劉攻芸，申達上述意見。</p>
<h3>閩軍公運輸日繁加强福廈路交通</h3>
<p>〔本報福州十一日電〕閩境軍公運輸日繁，綏署已令閩公路工程處趕築福廈路路面，及馬尾羅星塔間穿山工程，俾自閩江經榕·泉·至廈門港沿海陸路交通加强效率。向時省保安部為維護福廈路行車安全，經已派兵機動清剿散匪，務求全綫暢通無阻。至閩北公路，路面橋樑亦多不勝負担，公路局已派員赴南平，負責辦理加固工程。</p>
<h3>穗港間一貨船遭受海盜洗刧</h3>
<p>〔聯合社香港十二日電〕本月十日有海盜五十名，携帶湯姆槍與手榴彈，搶刦廣州開往香港之貨船一艘，搜刦十四小時後，滿載而逸，並綁去水手六人。</p>
<h3>政府决保衛廣州　穗曾舉行重要軍事會議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社廣州十二日電〕政府領袖昨夜舉行重要軍事會議，决定保衛廣州一如保衛上海然。李代總統，華中軍事長官白崇禧，國防部長何應欽，廣州綏靖主任余漢謀，廣東省政府主席薛岳與陸軍總司令張發奎均出席會議。</p>
<h3>來滬商人談：無錫種種</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕自無錫葉守後，本市各界及無錫旅滬同鄉對該地之現况至為關切，紀者昨特走訪最近自無錫搭乘民船來滬之商人，據談：無錫於四月廿三日午夜十二時失守，共軍先頭部隊於十二時後及翌日上午進城，狀甚疲憊，似為經長途跋涉而來者，且多十六七歲少年，所携武器為步搶及手榴彈，機關槍亦屬少見，並無大砲等重武器。入城後，因兵力薄弱，故城中治安仍由民眾自衛團負責，一切尚安寗，並無搶刧等事發生，一星期後，始由共軍接管城防，自衛團槍彈即被全部繳械。截至目前為止，政工人員入城者亦僅少數。報館於共軍入城後，即全部停閉，先有共方新華社印發電訊，繼接收大錫報及民報社後，即出版蘇南日報，對開兩大張，所刋均為宣傳新民主主義及共軍如何接收平津及渡江等等舊事，因此銷路呆滯。城區戶口尚未調查，故進出不受限制，即使由無錫來滬，中途經過共軍步哨綫時，亦不十分困難。</p>
<p>無錫現已改設為市，據共方人員對無錫民眾閒談時透露，彼等對各項接收工作，頗黨千頭萬緒，無從着手，蓋接收人員多為青年，缺乏實際經驗。關於工商業及金融方面，表面上商店均已復業，唯營業清淡，老闆發不出薪俸，店員多為停薪留職，工廠亦已復工，唯成品無法外銷，多出售與共方指定之企業公司。金圓券，共軍入城後公告，於五月十三日後停止使用，唯商店自共軍入城後，即拒絕使用。人民銀行設於無錫縣銀行內，銀圓掛牌，第一日掛大頭三百五十元，小頭為大頭之九折，鷹龍洋為大頭之八折，然並無兌出，而銀牛手中之黑市價，即高達四萬五十元，人民銀行第二日即自動將人民券貶值，將大頭掛高至每枚四有五十元，然黑市又抬高至六百元。</p>
<p>娛樂場所仍照常營業，投機商人更在城中公園飯店內開設茶室，舉行茶舞，共軍亦有入內觀光者。共軍多為蘇北籍，對電燈無綫電及電影等均感興趣，其他對於橡膠鞋及自來水筆亦均喜愛。又，四鄉土共自共軍正式接管無錫後，即整隊來城邀功，結果均被繳械後命令改編，致令土共大失所望，故四鄉刻已較前安密，城區住民多有搬居鄉間者，聞因恐國軍飛機前往轟炸。火車由無錫可通至蘇州及鎮江，均為軍用車，並無規定開車時間，人民搭乘者僅屬少數，城內外建築物一無損壞，兩路局新建之無錫車站大廈，亦完好無恙。</p>
<h3>做「解放教員」的滋味</h3>
<p>— 何云</p>
<p>這是一位在逃難旅途上已經疲倦了的小學教師的親身經歷，他本來像文中說的，已無力再逃了，但他終於忍心的拋下了他的愛妻幼兒逃了出來，本文是他安全地到了青島以後，最急切要傾吐的申訴，爰為發表，以　讀者。</p>
<p>當那個「家家泉水，戶戶垂楊」，號稱小江南的山東省城，被「解放」後，我們這羣「無恒產而有恒心」的中小學教師們，即在欲逃無力的情况下，也被宣告了「解放」，並也在「駕輕就熟」的寬大政策號召下，重作馮婦，但「解放教育」，是必須接近民眾的，所以也必須率領學生，去對民眾做各種宣傳，因此各位教員先生們，就必須被逼着說出「喪權賣國的×××」了，但當你正在「破口大罵」的時候，你的聽眾父老們，就都在偷偷的作着鬼臉，從內心裏痛罵你「寡康鮮恥」，你們究竟是些什麽東西？在你的心靈交感下，受到了這種無言的譴責，試問你的良心（假若未完全泯滅）到底是感覺一種什麽滋味？</p>
<p>「解放教育」是「民主」的，所以一切均須取决於學生，如考試看書，是參考參考，沒有關係；聽到飛機的聲音，就說敵機來襲，停止授課。做教師的，只有順應「民意」，說好好好的份兒，假若你不識相，碰半個不字，管保立刻就會被「反應」為「思想頑固，違背民主，着即調往×地重新學習的」，試問這種漫無限制的「民主」作風，到底應該怎樣應付呢？</p>
<p>有一次，我上算術課時，有一個新來的學生，突然發問道：「先坐！為什麽那麽一個「十」字，就叫做加法呢？」像這樣的閃電奇襲，要不是有三把神沙，准會被弄一個滾鞍落馬的。幸那時筆者福至心靈，便接着反問道：「可是你這位同學貴姓呀？」他說：「姓趙」，冷不防我又追問：「那麽你為什麽姓趙？」這時他張口結舌，被我難倒了，那時我勝算在握，慢條斯理的說：「那麽你的姓趙，是不是因為你爸爸姓趙呢？」「你爸爸是不是又因了你祖父姓趙，他才姓趙呢？」這樣一代一代的推上去，就證明了你的姓趙，是由祖先傳下來的，至於「十」字之所以為加，也就像你之所以姓趙一樣，是由從前那位發明這個記號的人，一代一代傳下來的。」於是他坐下了。</p>
<p>不錯，這也許是由於一般天真的孩子們，受了求知慾的驅使，所發出的問題，不一定就含有什麽惡意，但他們每在這樣發問時，確是顯然的帶了滿臉的獰笑，尤其你是個初被「解放」的教師，是經不起他們這一連串的問難的，諸如：「什麽叫做泰河事件？」「什麽叫做三灣事件？」「先生從前為什麽要當漢奸？」這一類連他們在學校裏的「政委」都不能解答，和使你啼笑皆非的問題，問到了你的頭上，你究將感到什麽滋味？</p>
<h3>總統府發言人聲明　內閣改組說不確　蔣總統並未指揮軍事　政府不預備放棄上海</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十二日電〕連日各報紛傳內閣即將改組，引起各方多所揣測，頃據總統府發言人宣稱：李代總統對何內閣月餘來之辛勞策劃，深致佩慰，並認定何院長在現階段中，為唯一足以肩任艱鉅總攬軍政與籠罩各方至適當之人選，决不能輕言更易，外傳某某將繼長政院與內閣改組之說全屬子虛。</p>
<p>鮑靜安答記者問</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十二日電〕政院新聞處飽靜安處長，十二日在記者招待會中答復詢問如左：</p>
<p>（問）蔣總統目前在政府方面地位如何？在黨的方面地位如何？</p>
<p>（答）蔣總統已退休，此點業有文告說明，在黨的方面，蔣先生仍為國民黨總裁。</p>
<p>（問）蔣總統是否指揮上海方面戰事？</p>
<p>（答）蔣總統並夫指揮軍事。</p>
<p>（問）外傳蔣總統將赴台灣，有謂將赴廣州，究以何說為確？</p>
<p>（答）據余所知，蔣總統並不來廣州，至是否赴台，則無法知悉。</p>

<h3>顧維鈞向艾契遜提議　組織亞洲聯盟　我决全力保衛國家人民自由</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕中國今日籲請美國依照北大西洋條約，發起亞洲聯盟以制止東方之共產主義。中國駐美大使顧維鈞在三十五分鐘會議中，曾向美國國務卿艾契遜提出此項要求，事後據顧氏向記者稱，中國希望區域的防務協定，以證明愛好自由各國之問題互相一致，艾氏對余之要求表示同情的接受，但並未提出許諾。余曾告艾氏中國國民政府决心出全力以保衛國家之自由與人民之自由。顧氏於答復記者時稱，余希望此種决定可以消除美國對中國問題採取决策或切實立場時之猶豫不定。顧氏不欲透露艾契遜談話內容，僅稱，艾氏曾提及杜魯門總統上月簽署北大西洋條約時所發表之聲明。按總統當時曾謂美政府對民主與自由之關切，不以歐洲為限。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日電〕顧維鈞大使今要求美國對國民政府之反共戰爭予以積極而具體之支援，俾清除我國及亞洲其他各國人士認為美國對亞洲所發生事件漠不關心之憂慮與疑怯。聞顧使今與國務卿艾奇遜會談半小時，當曾要求美國能發表一同情之聲明，以支援國民政府，並明白確定能予國民政府之道義與物質援助。顧氏辭出後語記者稱：渠曾向艾氏說明中國最近局勢之發展及國民政府抗拒共黨之决心。顧氏並謂：國民政府本身作此反共决策後，吾人希望此舉能促進美國確定其對中國戰爭之立場。按在國共和談期間，艾奇遜與其他國務院官員曾聲明，美國將不致再行援華。顧使復稱：在關注和平一點而言，中國固極歡迎北大西洋公約，然亦並非無憂慮存在，因美國及其他大西洋公約簽字國家，對中國及其他重要區域之民主與自由之維護迄未同時致力也。此舉固可解釋為美國對於亞洲事項之關注遠不若大西洋區域之深切。縱令美國官員之一再否認，且就中國現在所發生之事件觀之，復佐以美國對華缺乏其對歐之積極行動，因此，中國人士深感憂慮與疑怯。記者曾詢渠是否力倡亞洲應亦有一似北大西洋公約之防務公約，顧氏答稱：並非完全雷同，然有若干跡象，顯示美國關注世界各處之自由問題，並無軒輊。顧氏末謂：除非美國能重申其興趣，並不低於北大西洋公約區域之一隅，則亞洲及世界其他各部份，定將紛紛議論美國對大西洋公約區域以外之共黨猖狂，全不在意。顧氏復謂：艾氏對其言論甚表同情。</p>

<h3>國際救濟機構　在華活動大减　一般人士深為惋惜</h3>
<p>〔路透社廣州十二日電〕許多在華的救濟機構，不論其屬國際性者，美國者，或屬於華人主持而受到外國的援助者，皆在紛紛討論彼等未來的地位。其中較大者，若經合署等，在華付出之救濟物資已至鉅大，其在華的組識，亦極為龐大，此等機構，雖已嘉惠無數中國人民，但無疑的，在中共政權之下，顯然將停止活動。其他的救濟機構，雖有願在中共區繼續活動之意，但能否辦到，尚待中共當局决定，一般人士莫不因彼等對華所供給技術援助之將半途而廢，深為惋惜。經合署現為在華最大的外國援助機構，至目前為止，其援華數額，直接來自外國者計達二億四千萬元，因出售棉織品而得之援助資金，亦達美金一千七百萬元，其供給中國之物品，有米·石油產品·棉花·肥料·藥品等，現經合署中國分署總部已自滬遷穗，其有廿七個國籍的職員，人數亦已大减，其中美籍者已减至五十六人，該署在中國各地之工作，均係自中共接收以後始行停止。另一美國機構為農村復興聯合委員會，於去年十月一日在京成立後，不久即遷穗，迄今在華所耗資金，亦已達美金六百五十萬元，根據美國國會决議，該機構將不得在中共區內工作。此外，若世界衛生組織，聯合國糧食農業組織，聯合國兒童救濟會等，能否繼續在中共區內活動，亦均在未定之天。至於直轄行政院之善後事業保管委員會所屬之漁管處等四機構，雖係繼續聯總行總之未了任務，能否繼續在共區活動，亦殊少把握。</p>

<h3>專論　今日之上海經濟問題</h3>
<p>— 周力行</p>
<p>上海本為萬惡都市，逃入戰時狀態以後，可能降低豪富寓公之車受水準，可能整飭投機奢靡之惡習，亦可能使物資缺乏，工人失業，民生困難，社會不安。故今日上海之經濟問題，與政治軍事社會民生諸問題，已分不開；經濟問題不能全面顧到，得不到適當解决，則對於社會民生之影響，政治軍事之後果，可想而知，平時貪污無能與特權自私之惡勢力甚大，雖有賢者，亦莫與匹敵，今應利用千載一時之良機，根據戰時事實上之需要，大刀闊斧，剷除上層社會投機自私與不合理之弊害，而防止下層民生困難之惡果。前者屬於財政金融之措施，後者為民生經濟之範圍，茲就急切需要，而可能做到者簡述如下：</p>
<p>一·民生經濟問題</p>
<p>現在華北與津浦路之燃煤棉花，長江中游與太湖沿岸之米，固不能來，即上海週邊之魚類猪仔蔬菜木柴，亦因軍事範圍縮小，而致來源稀少，或者進入不易，曠日持久，六百餘萬人之生活必需品，必將發生嚴重問題。查上海已為台灣之前哨，上海所需煤米，除報載上海市府已請經合署協助外，台灣似亦不能辭其大量供應之責。軍事方面，倘能設法使太潮以東各縣之米糧蔬菜木柴及長江口之魚類大量流入，則市區之生活立覺輕鬆矣。</p>
<p>用水用電，均應即加限制，以省燃煤，汽油可以直接代替燃料，應即限制車輛使用，交通可以多開電車與公共汽車，除緊急之軍用物品外，不必用汽車運輸，宴會應即停止，將所有酒樓改為公共食堂，以節蔬菜魚肉，食米應减少定量，除士兵與勞工外，每人以一粥一飯為限。</p>
<p>正值漁汛期間，如能保護捕魚，便利進出，上海週邊如能擴大範圍，搜購糧食畜類菜蔬，一面節約消費，一面大量冷藏與製造罐頭食品，以應熱天及軍事緊張時之需用。</p>
<p>除軍糧專有機構統籌外，公教人員與一般民眾、貧富不均，儲量不等，一至米珠薪桂之時，不免發生搶米風潮，政府除向台灣及國外爭取來源外；一面亦應分區調查民間儲糧，必要時予以統籌配給，以有餘補不足，並須多設發售處所，以免如今日購買戶口米之排班等候，既耗費民時民力，又足以形成糧荒之象徵。</p>
<p>將來戰事緊張，範圍緊縮，一部工廠必至停工，娛樂場所必至關閉，應先將樂隊舞女，予以短期訓練，分別編組為慰勞看護隊，適時調用。以勵士氣。屆時並可限制乃至禁止非軍公用之車輛使用，以為勞工開闢踏車搬運之生路。</p>
<p>二·財政金融之改革</p>
<p>貨幣之有一定價格，在便於為交易之中準，其本身並不能為人類生活上所享用，頻年戰爭，貨幣之價值，往往隨政治環境而轉變，察其變跡，並無一定而公平之標準，抗戰勝利時，法幣與「儲幣」及現在共黨所發紙幣與金圓劵之比率，究憑何種標準，是否準確而公平，殊難定言。無論紙幣或硬幣，流通廣，物資多，則信用著，價值高，今範圍縮小，物資缺乏，人皆以為紙幣貶值，不知即使財政上能收支平衡，或將時代倒退，完全使用硬幣，仍非貶值不可。試佇立於沙漢中，雖滿載珠寶，亦無價值可言；因無物可換也。貨幣價值，既因政治環境而轉變，其變為貶值之結果，政府不勝印刷之負担，人民不堪其損失，考究原因，乃由於票面上固定了貨幣價格—圓角分，一至物價高漲，貨幣貶值，即不能不加印大額票面，如能作革命性之發行「活用單位券」，只印個十百等數字，而不印明價格，其計算單位，由政府以命令規定，則可適應任何政治環境，通貨永不膨脹，人民永無損失，計賬永遠簡便。例如個位一之活用單位券一張，今如假想以相當於銀元一角之金圓券為其比值，則規定其計算單位為金圓五十萬元，他日銀元一角值金圓五百萬，則以命令變更活用券之計算單位為金圓五百萬元。如政治環境轉變，銀元一角只值金圓券一角，亦隨之更改其計算單位為金圓一角，以及對於外匯之比率，或與任何國家幣券發生連帶關係的，均只需公佈其計算單位，而無需變更幣券之名稱，與改印票面不同之新券，則發行不必增加，人民儲蓄不受損失，對外貿易如能統制，不使入超，則國內物價，只與計算單位有關，而與通貨及民生不生影響，至於名稱，或簡稱「活用券」「單位券」，或用其他適當名稱，均無不可。其學理上是否說得通，技術上如何辦得到，尚希國內外學者專家不吝指教。惟覺吾人應隨歷史演進，與社會需要，研究創造，世界各國現行幣制如不改革，將來第三次大戰發生，亦必遭遇我們今日之困難也。</p>
<p>去午八一九發行金圓券時，規定行莊資本為一百萬與五十萬，不三天即减為半數，一個月後檢查行莊資本時，金圓券已貶值五倍，等於五萬與二萬五千之銀元矣，並得以不動產抵充。故行莊除招牌與門面外，可不另籌資本，專賴信用從事投機，此為上海之一大害。雖經蔣經國君力爭，財部終未採納，中央政策姑息，老虎又打不倒，所以當時經濟督導不能收效。現可利用戰事迫近，投機事業較少，資本轉移，不致多所爭持之良機，提高行莊資本額，不合者吊銷其執照，或令其合併營業，或可减少三分之一乃至半數之行莊。戰後不再增發執照，並嚴核其營業範圍，庶可徐圖其他金融上之良好措施也。</p>
<p>要之，倘我全國上下，能認識時代，破除情面，犧牲小我，顧全民生，即速改革，蓄意圖治，救國救民，猶未為晚也。（卅八年五月十一日）</p>

<h3>柏林鐵路公路交通開放　德國人民歡欣若狂　美英東駛列車安抵目的地</h3>
<p>〔合眾社柏林十二日電〕蘇方對柏林之對鎖，巳於今日午夜十二時零一分（柏林時間，上海時間十二日晨七時零一分）告終，卡軍，汽車，吉普車開始在柏林興英蘇佔區邊界之赫姆斯台特兩地間高速度汽車道上往返疾馳。解除對鎖之時限到來時，柏林蘇區內之電力廠僅量發電，西區中燈火輝煌。戰爭結束以來，此為柏林最歡樂之夜，酒吧間咖啡館與夜總會通查營業，顧客滿座。據國西部飛機塲之盟國飛行員亦辦飲慶祝。</p>
<p>〔職合社柏林十二日電〕柏林今日準備慶祝對鎖解除，學校停課，多數商店停榮，平民數千人將聚焦柏林西區市政廳前，探聽西德三國軍事總督之慶祝情形。西德制憲議會已派代表團前來柏林參加慶祝。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林十二日電〕盟國空運飛機今日繼續每隔九十秒鐘，降落柏林一架，並不因地面交通之恢復而停止活動。西柏林市議會今晨召開特別會，以討論對鎖解除後的市政計劃，當英美法總督蒞塲列席時，場外市民歡呼聲雷動。蘇區各工廠於下午齊嗚汽笛，以紀念「區間諒解的獲得」。同時東柏林區並召開民眾大會，以表示「柏林市民不忘統一柏林及德國的意志」。封鎖後第一列自柏林駛出之火車，為一德國區間客車，於下午一時半駛離柏林。在柏林及東西德交界處各蘇方檢問站內，鮮聯官員均面　笑容，和靄地檢視住來人車之文件。前此懷疑蘇聯於最後仍將留　的人土，莫不為之松一口氣。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林十二日電〕西德第一列軍用火車於今晨一時廿三分開出，至五時卅分駛抵柏林英區夏浴登堡車站，較預定時間早一小時。該車由一巨型機頭拖曳，　滿綠色樹枝。車上有英美及其他盟國記者多人，英方執事人負，及英美兩合區運輸部主任英格里斯。據英氏稱，封鎖之解除，將使英美兩合區問與棘聯區間之十二條鐵道綫開放，此外內河運輸每日至少亦可載貨四千噸至柏林，公路運輸量亦至為可襯。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十二日電〕柏林解除封鎖後第一輛汽車，於本地時間一時四十四分駛入柏林城，該車由合眾社德國分社經理倫特爾所駕駛，據稱，此行極為順利。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十二日電〕第一列美軍用火車自法蘭克福駛出，已於今晨九時四十六分駛抵柏林。又第一列德國際火車於九時十分駛離漢諾威取道西台特開往柏林。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十二日電〕第一列盟國貨車於今日午後抵達柏林，自魯爾區載來燃煤四十二噸。</p>
<h3>魯爾區管制問題　將為外長會討論主題之一</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社已黎十一日電〕四強外長會議已定於廿三日在巴黎開幕，連日西方三強德國事務專家正忙於交換意見。各專家定下星期一舉行第一次會議，與會者將有美國巡　大使傑塞普·國務部顧間波倫。英外部專家寇克貝屈列克。法外部代表艾爾芳。艾氏於墨維爾目成功湖回國前，將任法國專家代表團主席。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十二日電〕法外交部今日否認若干報紙所戴之消息，謂法國曾要求英美兩國同意蘇聯參加管制魯爾區之工業。外部謂法國政府始終遵守其與西方各國對管制魯爾區所獲之協議，絕未提出任何新建議，此問題在不久舉行之四外長會講中自將加以討論。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十一日電〕可靠方面息，在木月廿三日在巴黎揭幕之外長會議中，法國將建議使蘇聯參加盟國對魯爾區煤斤鋼鐵工業之管制，以為對蘇重大讓步之一。兩年前法外長皮杜爾在莫斯科外長會中提出此建議時，曾遺貝文拒絕。英外次寇克貝屈列克於週末來巴黎時，法國官員將向其解釋時意蘇聯參加魯爾管制，乃易取蘇聯重大讓步值得付出的代價。法外交界相信蘇聯極度重視參加魯爾的管制，至少希望蘇聯得派觀察員一人，參加管制魯爾工業的機構。法外交界相信，蘇聯為使其得以插足魯爾管制制度起見，或將在外長會中有驚人的讓步。傳蘇陸軍參謀部曾告知克林姆宮方面，彼等必須獲知魯爾區的實際情形。巴黎方面有人建議由聯合國歐洲經委會設立聯合國主持下的魯爾煤斤局及鋼鐵局，此舉可使蘇聯得派監視員一人進入魯爾。法外界預料英國對於准許蘇聯插足醫爾的任何建議，必將堅決反對，但相信美國或可支援法國的建議。</p>
<h3>東憲法　在起草中</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十二日電〕東德領袖人民議會主席諾許克昨日聲稱，欲在西德憲法與正由德人民委會起草中的東德憲法之間，獲得折衷方案，並不困難，在起草中的東德憲法，須經人民大會批准後始能生效。人民大會代表將於本週末選舉，然後即根據人民委會起草之憲法，逐條加以討論。諾氏並稱，渠所領導的人民委會將不贊成由東德與西德諸邦合組散漫的聯邦，除此以外，人民委會願意贊成任何確保德國統一的折衷憲法。</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統重行聲明　支持聯合國機構　希望他國能遵守憲章下義務</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十二日電〕杜魯門總統十二日稱，美國仍完全支持聯合國，雖然美國對此一安全機構已感失望。在提出國會的三百○三頁關於美國在一九四八年參加聯合國的報告書中，杜魯門作上項聲明。</p>
<p>該報告書係國務院準備者，國務卿艾契選在序言中稱，「美國殊無妥善的理由，對聯合國失去信心，但同時渠指出，「美國及其他國家鑒於若干國家不能遵守渠等在憲章下的義務，使聯合國不能成為保障和平的充份機構，深感失望。」渠稱，由於此一世界機構在安全方面的「不夠」，美國及其他國家乃不得不在聯合國以外締結大西洋公約及採取其他步驟，但其目標實與聯合國一致。</p>
<p>今日情勢己非昔比</p>
<p>杜魯門解釋艾契遜的報告稱，「如果腳合國在保障安全方面已使吾人失望，如果吾人不得不採取輔助性的措施，以應付對吾人的安全的實際及潛在成脅，這並不是因為美國沒有忠誠努力，使聯合國臻於盪善盡美之境。現在的世界，並不是四年前的舊金山會議閉幕時吾人所希望的世界。」但杜魯門強調稱，美國仍「在各方面支持聯合國。」渠稱，在安理曾中擁有否決權的五強，對維護憲章及「和平解決他們的國際糾紛」，實有特殊的義務，「此等義務的實現，即表示在國際關係中的國家自制。」渠稱，「美國在一九四八年認識其憲章義務，「吾人並將繼續認識此等義務，吾人亦有權利要求其他國家同樣認識此等義務。」</p>
<h3>龍頭與九洲火併　今日競奪民主杯</h3>
<p>九洲與龍頭今日在南市民主杯遭遇，下午五時開始，是賽雖非最後一幕，但其實際重要性則等於決賽。查龍頭既往成績，以二比一勝大夏，二比二和中藝，二比零挫華光，目前以五分之最高得點，領袖　雄。該隊今日如能壓倒九洲，則尚餘對磐隊及三星兩場，祗三星為一重難關，必須苦戰耳。如今日九洲獲勝，則九洲尚剩對磐隊與中藝二幕，　藝雖為南市地頭蛇，而實力究竟較九洲略遜，九洲錦標，或已有七成把握。徜今日戰成和局，則無異代中鑿造機會，因中藝曾勝三星三比一，和龍頭與華光各為二比二，亦己得四分，所餘三塲比賽為磐隊，大岌與九洲，至少可再增四分。三星在揭幕賽中，因高保正等缺席，並由十人應戰，致以一對三慘敗於中鑿，目前僅以三分屈居第四席。惟三星如能作最後努力，進而擊敗筆光與龍頭，則民主杯誰屬，尚為一謎。</p>
<p>高秀清註冊龍頭後，最初兩場未曾出席，致秀清為能頭助陣一節，不免令人懷疑。詎龍頭第三坎對華光一役，秀清突然登塲，蓋知華光為一不易對付之球隊，非秀清臨陣，不足克敵致果。是賽龍頭居然淨贏兩球，秀清不謂無功。同時，秀清在龍頭出現，則「泥地龍」奪取銀杯之企圖，已昭然若揭。前日聯隊向三屋挑戰，九洲隊負除孟義良與劉體寅二人外，餘子在聯隊無名者，亦正為養精蓄說，以圖今日大舉。故今日為一塲苦戰窮拼之比賽。裁判員王琳，巡邊員倪世耀談榮生。為維持球塲秩序起見，今日入場券改售一百萬元。雙方陣容如下</p>

<h3>甲組足球本週結束　龍頭鐵路週末重賽</h3>
<p>足球甲組聯賽自去歲十月底開賽以來，經數閱月之角逐，將於本週全部結束，第二循環最後一仗中航對志超週六（十四日）舉行。另有龍頭與鐵路之重賽，則在週末（十五日）踢出。兩場比餐均自下午四時起在逸園球場舉行。各該塲裁判巡邊亦經足球裁判會排定併誌如后：</p>

<h3>甲組乒乓聯賽　華聯力克郵乙</h3>
<p>今日續有乙組三場角逐</p>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽，前日甲組華聯對壘郵乙於國貨球室，雙方均未以全力臨陣，首組郵乙擋手朱錦海雖遭遇盧文良之猛攻，賴其防守堅固，使對方無法得逞，盧竟為所挫，此役錦海短擊出色，力奪頭陣，可謂不易。次組郵乙以喻春榮出戰華聯李震，喻擋手及近網短擋，落點殊佳；無如李震為全能好手，從容還擊，得心應手，喻招架乏術，以直落二敗陣。第三組華聯楊志雄力戰朱仲孫，楊於首局中，挺佔俊勢，但終以廿二對廿四失利，次局遂古不支而退。第四組郵乙戚文苑，遠非對方之敵，以○對二敗於華聯隊長張志鴻之手。末組決戰，華聯削手潘日熙，恰逢郵乙抽手沈愛仁，潘削沈抽，劇戰至烈，沈先勝一局，觀眾皆為潘危，不料沈於次局稍一大意，竟為潘扳成平手，第三局為雙方生死關頭，潘日熙力持鎮定，削出之球異常旋轉，沈連抽失效，復以長力不濟，反以一對二飲恨退塲。結果華聯以三對二反敗為勝，可謂險矣。</p>
<p>乙組各塲中，以乙一部養保對郵思之戰雙方勢均力敵，競爭殊烈，郵思因主將戴凌虛之受挫，改變大局，殊屬可惜，結果善保賴隊長金肇民以直落二戰勝郵思老將房十瑞，全隊以三對二奪得最後勝利。茲探錄兩塲戰績及前賽結果如下：</p>

<h3>籃球甲二組名位賽　機警紅騎合眾晉級</h3>
<p>今夕三塲中回力逢美氣象</p>
<p>籃球聯賽甲二組名位賽昨晚第二夕，結果警機·紅騎·合眾三隊分別在三組中晉級。比賽經過如下：</p>
<p>首仗第三組合眾對又一，合眾下馬施咸，蔣恩寶雙中，李振邦一擲，六比零前導，又一張伐罰球得點，華紹唐與衛禹平互中，成八比三，嗣以拉鋸作戰，前半結束，十比十五，又一落後五分。休息過後，又一蘇石鳳衛禹平頗見振作，一度追成十六比十八，轉瞬成廿三平手，合眾急以李培棟入替華敬亭，果然合眾又好轉，終場時合眾以　二比廿五克又一。</p>
<p>繼之平平與紅騎作戰，紅騎舒家義接連兩中開紀錄，平平不甘屈居，宋連庠雙擲各四放平。智昂錦康互罰各五·各七·三次平手·此後平平大見活躍，運取八分，紅騎力追無效，上半時平平十五，紅騎十三，相差一球。再戰聲中，平平尚見活躍，但紅騎所得亦不少，遂至十九比廿，接而以廿三比廿二反側大局。平平經此折挫，士氣大受影響，雖追成各卅平等，但強弩之末，結果紅騎以卅八比卅一，反敗勝平平。</p>
<p>壓軸C組冠軍健樂與B組亞軍警機對壘，健樂張嚴犯規，黃可根兩罰兩中開紀錄，張俊才罰回一分，警機楊霞蓀又一擲一罰，成五比一，健樂急停。田兆　古振基雙管齊下，十比三，金堃張嚴先後中的，七比十接近，但轉瞬警機得生力參戰，張天祥等屢有得手，十八比八，健樂又下沉。金堃張嚴再當努力，以十二比十八結束上半時。易籃過後，健樂力事振作，戰局成拉鋸，八分鐘時健樂張嚴傷眼，周　入代，一度追成廿二比廿四，警機以田兆祺換張榮志，楊霞蓀兩中，黃可根添三分，成廿九比廿三。健樂顏局金三將用命，廿九比卅五略有進展，但未幾警機又告順手，健樂無法抵禦，遂以卅二比四三敗於警機。</p>

<h3>民營公營電台　歸併剩十五家</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕廣播事業勝利後在本市曾盛極一時，公營民營電台陸續設立達卅家之多。去年當局為實施統一管理，經核定公營電台計十二個KC，民寬葉電台計十五個KC，（KC亦卽廣播綫之謂）。迨至最近時局轉急，軍事當局鑒於廣播事業有加強管理必要，特令公營民營電台分別縮併一半。經各電台集會商討，一部份亦認為廣吿客戶减少，支出反見增加，實際亦需要歸併，故決定本身原有名義仍鳴，業務則併入其他另一電台。目前全市各電台採取此種合作方式播音後，現存者除上海電台外，僅餘公營電台六個KC，民營電台八個KC，總數祗十五家。</p>

<h3>雙槍王八妹近事</h3>
<p>— 橫陽客</p>
<p>如果你想起山東的游擊之母趙老太太，一定會連想到當年在浙西叱咤一時的雙槍黃八妹的。三年來似乎時過境遷，報章雜誌之間，很難找到這位巾幗英雄的消息了。筆者此次杭遊歸來，順道往平湖一轉，與當地田糧處陳副處長等，臨時組織一個黃八妹訪問團，分子有中央，省級，縣級人員，還有軍人，新聞記者，攝影師和太太小姐們，在一個春光明媚的早晨，我們坐上專車，向着乍浦出發。</p>
<p>理想的家庭</p>
<p>乍浦有一座小小的土城，據說築自明代防倭時期，瀕臨大海，面對黃山，山明水秀，風景宜人。黃八妹住在城東的總管衖四十四號，是一座中西合璧的兩進三間平房，客廳內外，還掛名人書畫，以及中外名流的贈照，窗明几净，雅緻莊嚴。她的丈夫謝友勝，今年五十六歲，個子高大，態度和藹，抗日時期，曾在她的部下充當大隊長，頗著功績。她本來有三男一女，大公子被日本憲兵隊殺死，次子宗安務農，三子宗國，現在杭州中正中學唸書，女公子安德，就讀乍浦小學，她家庭雖然沒有幾個人，而傭人很多，還有兩位女秘書。當我們到達時因她偶感不適，先由秘書汪淑英小姐來招待，不多時，她與她外子也出現於我們眼前了，經過陳副處長代爲介紹之後，我們就互相攀談起來，她講到打游擊戰，猶津津有味，不時破口大笑。最使我們欽佩的，而是她倆夫婦的一舉一動，相敬如賓，自由，幸福，和平，快樂，充滿了這個理想的家庭。</p>
<p>聲威永不减</p>
<p>黃八妹又名百梅，字百器，今年四十四，身材矮胖，體格強健，待人誠懇，舉動大方，尤以談鋒甚健，誰也不相信她原是一個不識字的女英雄。昔年經營鹽業，往來平湖乍浦之間，急公好義，素爲鄉人愛戴。抗日時期，因她有功邦國，勝利後，卽榮膺浙江省府參議。由於她名聲遠揚，中外人士特來拜訪者，幾乎日無間斷，所以她在黃山之巔，建築一座黃山招待所，專爲招待來賓之需。此次我們會作黃山之遊，她欣然雇車同往，是日適値香汎，行人如織，道經之處，老百姓都立正致敬，直到她的車子離開很遠時，始紛紛走開，聽說這些老百姓們，大都是她昔日的幹部，除一部份安插在縣保警隊，鄕鎭警備班之外，馀皆務農或經商，如果她下了一個命令，只需一小時工夫，仍可集中起來，足見她的威名，不减當年呢！</p>
<p>培植第二代</p>
<p>由於她感受不識字的苦痛，勝利之後，卽獨資建築校舍，創設乍浦完全小學，爲了進一步培植下一代的幼苗，上年間再創辦一所海風中學，（海風係取義她的海風游擊隊）師資係由當地國立水產學校教員兼課的，每逢星期一，她必親臨學校，做一次精神講話，「忠國家，孝民族」，是她講話的題材，也是她平生做人做事的標的，有時還帶着許多書籍和文具，分贈貧寒學生，她說：「孩子們都稱我爲黃先生，其實我沒有資格做他們的先生，相反的，他們都會讀書，寫字，而我呢，偏偏目不識丁」。他談到乍浦老百姓，十九是文盲，將來打算利用他們的空暇，創辦民衆學校，使每個失學的成人和婦女們，都有機</p>
<p>唸書；她以極欣愉的心情，很堅決地說：「今後乍浦七歲以下的女孩子們，再也找不出第二個不識字的黃八妹了」</p>
<p>她直接間接囊助地方政府之處，委實不少，例如去冬策動，民衆集體完糧，敦促乃夫出任乍浦鎭長，救濟難民，修築道路等等，頗著勞績。她希望和平早日來臨，使人民得有喘息機會，她說她將偕其外子及兒女們，共隱林泉。了其餘年。</p>

<p>主犯吳錦榮與女犯林麗華之認識，係吳在建甌中學充當教官時，又因吳亦曾一度執教建甌培漢中學，而華之堂兄林戈民，時卽肄業該校，故亦熟悉，此次吳因治肺結核症擬往南京，適華亦避婚來榕，而吳雖使君有婦，與華仍有不解之緣。吳抵榕後卽寄居於學院路三號學院附中宿舍其過去學生處，林戈民兄妹時常前來尋訪，一同外出遊玩，先是華寓居其表叔周建珍家，而上杭路一八二號建隆木行，亦爲周建珍開設，故被綁架之王潤泉來榕銷售木材，亦卽住居周家，吳林兩犯同屬建甌籍，獲悉王之富有，共謀敲詐，適又有華之內綫認有詐局進行更易，幾經密商，卒於去年十一月四日下午五時開始，吳自在東亞歌塲門口守候，使由林戈民向中平路大中汽車行中掛電話找王潤泉，佈置旣妥，林卽趕至小橋頭等候華之消息，當華奔吿王已中計赴約時，而吳挾王之汽車亦適時駛抵小橋頭，吳當卽招林一同登車，汽車馳至南門兜時司機曾一度向林吳詢駛何處，吳卽以手指示烏山路方面，囑卽加油駛去，及駛過小柳鄕路口十餘步時，始囑煞車，旋卽挾王下車，俟汽車灣轉駛離後，始轉回挾向小徑前往小柳灣，旣登樓上，卽令王席地而坐，迫令親筆簽發二百億元支票一紙，事畢，林吳當卽將樓梯搬向他處，自在樓下安睡，翌日一面發信一面向華探聽消息，旣知周家接到王信，便於五日下午另以一生面人持支票向周建珍索款，詎王本人並無現款存在周處，周對此卽予拒絕，當時吳林兩人又復登樓，向王談話，吳林恫嚇無效，至六日立發一信直接恐嚇周建珍，以「中國共產黨第十六縱隊」名義，脅迫周建珍代王如數付出二百億元，其中純以奸匪語氣，危言聳聽，並謂亦將予周以不利。語甫畢，房東林鄭氏突登樓，因樓上堆有農具，鄭氏上樓取用，見王卽向吳林問係何人？吳吿係友人生病，暫住此間，並立挾王下樓，待鄭氏取物旣畢，又復挾上，安置後再搬取樓梯，王登樓後無意間發現搬開農具處，有一小門赫然現出，急取他物遮蔽，以留脫身之用。枯坐多時，但聞樓下鼾聲如雷，王起撥小門向外探視，但見大路蜿蜒，四野星月交輝，極夜兎脫之念，又恐吳林兩人發覺，隨卽故意走動作響，隨卽故意走動作響，以試探樓下是否熟睡，蓋先時每逢樓上有走動聲時，樓下輒作咳嗽聲，拉槍機聲，王卽走動鼾聲依然，再動亦無反應，王猶不放心，又舉手取得屋頂瓦片摔下，仍無動靜，唯王仍不敢擅動，但撥開小門摸索，發現在門角有屋椽可資踏腳，而距離兩步，卽見有樓梯靠在該處，王發現生路，驚喜若狂，乃坐守待旦，黎明之際但聞樓下有刷牙聲，繼之又聞有脚步聲，瞬息闃無音息，王乃決心逃走，遂循小門　　踏出攀近樓梯，提心吊胆步下樓梯後，見廳中並無人影，再疾趨大門，又無所遇，至南門兜，由其雇車自去，王旣脫險，當卽鳴警，並請人保護，而翌日竟復有吳遣派之人，持支票到周家索款，當時王與周等卽擬予扣留，不圖華之內綫，眉睫之間向來人示警，致被逃脫，林麗華落網後，因與吴錦荣戀愛情深，及庭上追問急切，但云認識吳君，唯交情至淺，並謂吳已去南京，不在福州，此外又故作虛玄，企圖淆惑偵查進行，但對其於此案担當「內綫」一節，則極口否認。又以吳錦榮之名，假套爲「劉玉康」，後經警局方面多方研訊，並於麗華身中搜獲紙條中書：「麗華：你說下星期一晚前往看電影，我是在難等得很，好不好星期日（明日）一同往看？希望你給我一個答覆，完了。祝好！知名啓，星期六下午」等字，認爲書此紙條者必爲主犯之一，又經傳訊各有關之人，獲悉主犯爲吳錦榮，現住光祿坊尾版橋頭學院路三號，當即伏綫於十一月十三日下午，由李逸雲局長派馬祖輝率探員等前往偵捕，到達後發現吳不在屋內，唯留有行李一件，又查悉吳卽欲動身離閩此爲一最緊要關頭，馬急與伏綫者密商，由探員等分佈附近，並在門口貼一白紙，一俟主犯返屋，卽由伏綫者將白報紙址去以爲信號，守候二小時，至下午三時左右，光祿坊方面突有一靑年男子身着馬貢呢軍服，身佩軍官隊紀念章，下車前來，下車後卽匆匆奔入屋內，而門口之白紙隨亦扯去，探員等一湧上前，逕自擒送榕警局，鞠訊之餘，吳犯坦白供認邦架不諱，唯對林某之行踪，堅不吒實。</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Near Taicang, Communist Forces Repelled West of Jinshan, Situation in Northern Fujian Counties Remains Peaceful</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] Military headquarters released a war bulletin at 9:30 PM on the 12th:</p>
<p>(1) The 28th Army of the bandits, on the 10th, rapidly marched from Pingwang, Wujiang, and Wuxian to reinforce the Taicang area. On the 11th, they infiltrated the vicinity of Zhitang, northwest of Taicang. North of Taicang, two divisions of the 28th Army and the 86th Division of the 29th Army, with over 20 artillery pieces, began attacking Taicang in multiple directions at 15:00 on the 12th. As of the time of this dispatch, the bandits have suffered heavy casualties, with corpses littering the fields, but they are still reinforcing and counterattacking.</p>
<p>(2) Over 2,000 bandits launched a fierce attack on the positions of a certain unit of the National Army northeast of Taicang at Lujia Ferry at 15:00 on the 12th. The defending troops immediately fought back bravely, and fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>(3) A portion of the bandits, in coordination with local communists numbering about 500, infiltrated Qian Dun from Jiaozhi at 13:00 on the 12th. Local defending troops and local militia groups are strongly resisting them, and the battle situation is intense. Currently, the communication lines in the area have been disrupted due to damage.</p>
<p>(4) Over 1,000 bandits, at noon on the 12th, divided into groups and infiltrated the area west of Jinshan from Zhangjingwei and Fengjing, southeast of Jiashan. A certain unit of the defending troops resisted them, and after a fierce battle, the bandits retreated in disarray.</p>
<p>(5) In the afternoon of the 12th, over 1,000 bandits near Zhengyi, accompanied by ten-odd mules and horses, advanced westward towards Kunshan in dense formation. Our air force bombed them from the air, killing many bandits.</p>
<p>(6) The bandits advancing towards Shihutang (west of Songjiang) have been stopped near Bridge No. 46 and are being heavily annihilated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] Communist forces are gradually approaching our army's positions on the periphery of Taicang and Kunshan today. The air force is providing support to the army units on the front lines outside of Shanghai all day long. Large groups of planes are bombing Communist troops in areas north of Taicang, such as Zhitang, Zhitang, and Shuangfeng Town, killing and wounding over a thousand Communist soldiers. Eight Communist heavy artillery vehicles, ten Communist trucks, and forty wooden boats were destroyed. Of the approximately four hundred Communist wooden boats traveling north and south on the canal along the Sujia Line, over a hundred were destroyed. Over thirty of the hundred-odd Communist cavalrymen north of Wuxing City were killed. A Communist team three kilometers northeast of Fengjing Town, near the railway, was bombed, resulting in over two hundred deaths.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Fuzhou, 12th] Jianyang, Chongan, and Anxi in northern Fujian are peaceful, and communication lines are clear.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 12th] The spokesman for the Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office met with reporters from the Central News Agency on the afternoon of the 12th, stating that the Shanghai reports on the 11th claiming that a part of the main Communist force had arrived in Xingtian, under the jurisdiction of Chongan County in northern Fujian, on the 10th were inaccurate. He stated that the situation in all counties in northern Fujian remains peaceful, and Pucheng has a large military force stationed there. Only local communists are creating disturbances between Chongan and Jianyang, damaging communication lines and disrupting contact.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] Military headquarters news at 11:00 AM on the 12th:</p>
<p>(1) The over 2,000 bandits who infiltrated Jiashan continued to infiltrate Fengjing and Shihutang, east of Jiashan, along the railway on the night of the 11th. One group also infiltrated eastward. After being gradually resisted by a certain unit of our army, they are now confronting each other at Shihutang and Xingtazhen.</p>
<p>(2) Over a hundred bandits of the Shen Jinghuan faction of the Su-Kun detachment, entrenched in Chenmu Town (northwest of Dianshan Lake), were attacked by our dispatched troops on the night of the 11th, killing six or seventy bandits and seizing over fifty rifles, one machine gun, and one steamship. The remaining bandits fled westward.</p>
<p>(3) About two regiments of bandits north of Taicang, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked the Taojiazhai and Liwangmiao areas south of Yuewang City on the night of the 11th. Our army met them with a head-on attack, inflicting heavy casualties on the bandits, who reinforced and counterattacked. Fierce fighting was still ongoing until the morning of the 12th.</p>
<h3>Outskirts of Wuhan Have Become Peaceful, Hubei Provincial Government Moves West, Southeast Administrative Office Established</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hankou, 12th] There were no major engagements around Hankou today. Citizens did not hear gunfire, and people's hearts have calmed down. Many shops have reopened.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 12th] Since yesterday (the 11th), when the National Army, in coordination with the air force and artillery, repelled the bandits facing them in the Wuhan defense, the entire day today has been quiet, with no contact between the two sides. The opening battle of the Wuhan outer defense has come to an end. According to Huang Shengyuan, the spokesman for the garrison headquarters, told reporters: "There is no battle on the front lines today."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 12th] The Hubei Provincial Government moved west yesterday, and the Southeast Administrative Office of the Provincial Government was officially established on the same day. All personnel who did not move west with the government are working in the administrative office, and all work is proceeding as usual.</p>
<h3>Deng Wenyi Publishes Analysis of Recent War Situation, National Army Will Launch Severe Counterattack Against Bandits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, stated at a press conference on the 12th, "Analysis of the Recent War Situation": Since the Communist bandits disrupted peace and launched a large-scale attack, three weeks have passed. The military intentions of the Communist bandits are very clear, roughly divided into two aspects: one is that the three forces of Lin Biao, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Yi are advancing south across the Yangtze River in three routes. The other is that the three bandit armies of Nie Rongzhen, Xu Xiangqian, and Peng Dehuai are attacking the Northwest.</p>
<p>Currently, on the Yangtze River front, Chen Yi's bandit force, with about twelve armies, has gathered near Jinghang and Shanghai, seemingly actively preparing to attack Shanghai. Liu Bocheng's bandit force, with about nine armies, is advancing south from southern Anhui and has reached western Zhejiang and northeastern Jiangxi, echoing Chen's bandits and posing a threat to advance into Fujian and Jiangxi. Lin Biao's main force advancing south, with about six armies, is still between Jiujiang and Wuhan, north of the Yangtze River, and in the northwest Hubei area, waiting for the development of the situation in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River before launching an offensive towards Wuhan and its east and west.</p>
<p>Most of Nie's bandit force in the Northwest has entered Shanxi. After assisting in the capture of Taiyuan, they have recently joined with a part of Xu Xiangqian's bandit force to advance into Suiyuan and Shaanxi. Peng Dehuai's main force has pressed towards Guanzhong, seemingly preparing to launch an offensive towards Xi'an and the Wei River.</p>
<p>In the past, because the National Army sincerely sought peace, it did not actively prepare for war. Therefore, under the sudden general offensive of the Communist bandits, Taiyuan was forced to be abandoned, and Nanjing also made a strategic retreat. Although the National Army in those two places suffered considerable losses, the National Army still maintains its main force and is currently engaged in new deployments. At the appropriate time, it will launch a severe counterattack against the bandits. The war situation on both sides of the Yangtze River in the past week is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai Front: After Chen Yi's Communist bandits crossed the Yangtze River, they began to adopt an encirclement posture towards the Shanghai area. The bandits who crossed the river from the Jiangyin area were firmly resisted by the National Army in the Kunshan and Taicang areas. The bandit army repeatedly reinforced and attacked fiercely, but they were all repelled by the National Army in coordination with the air force. The bandit army on that line has suffered over 20,000 casualties. A part of the bandits circumventing in Jiashan, about 50,000, also suffered a head-on attack by the local garrisoned National Army, suffering heavy casualties. The 23rd Bandit Army suffered the most severe losses. With the mission accomplished, the National Army changed to defending the new defense line near Jiashan on the 6th and continued to strike at the invading bandits. Currently, the outer defenses of Shanghai are unusually solid, and the military strength is also very strong. The local authorities are urging citizens to store food, and the military and political authorities have decided to carry out a long-term defense. Strong troops of the National Army are arriving in Shanghai in a continuous stream, and the air force's sorties are dealing a major blow to the bandit army's movements and its transportation. Currently, the public sentiment in Shanghai is stable, and the sea and air routes to the outside world are as smooth as ever.</p>
<p>(2) Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front: Liu Bocheng's bandit army advanced directly towards the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Bojiang in southern Anhui. Changshan, Shangrao, Nancheng and other places have been occupied. Chen Geng's 4th Corps is being fiercely resisted by the reinforced troops of the National Army in the Dongxiang area. The National Army in Nanchang is also preparing to launch an active attack. A part of the bandit army is causing disturbances in Qianshan, attempting to infiltrate northern Fujian. At the same time, the bandits are deeply isolated, facing difficulties in supply, and their forces are dispersed, gradually experiencing difficulties.</p>
<p>(3) Central China Front: A part of the bandit army in northern Hubei is currently moving east, attempting to coordinate with the bandits advancing along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line. The 43rd Bandit Army is fleeing east from Guangji and Huangmei, and the 40th Bandit Army is south of Xiaogan. A part of it infiltrated and captured Hengdian on the 8th. Wuxue, at the junction of Hubei and Jiangxi, was infiltrated and captured by over a thousand of Zhang Tixue's local communist forces on the 7th. The National Army still has a large army holding Wuhan's three towns.</p>
<h3>Political Center of Jiangxi Moves to Ganxian</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ganzhou, 12th] After the provincial government moved south, Ganxian has become the political center. The heads of all provincial government agencies have arrived. The provincial party headquarters, the provincial security command, and the military police corps have all moved here. The Central Bank has also established an office here to prepare for resuming business. Ganxian originally had a population of less than 50,000, but now it has 60,000. The streets are as prosperous as before. However, the market refuses to use gold yuan coupons, and all transactions are mainly in silver dollars and silver dimes. Although the Fourth District Commissioner's Office issued a notice strictly prohibiting this, it has not been effective. The general public hopes that the silver dollar coupons will be realized soon, otherwise, government employees will be on the verge of desperation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ganzhou, 12th] After the provincial government moved to Ganxian, the first provincial affairs meeting was held here this morning. Chairman Fang Tian is on his way to Gan from Ji'an.</p>
<h3>US Far East Command Announces That Only Northeast China Still Has Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] A spokesman for the US Far East Command announced on the 12th that only Northeast China still has Japanese troops. In addition, there are only a few scattered elements. According to reports on the number of Japanese troops on Victory over Japan Day and the number of Japanese residents in Northeast China, there are still 60,000 people remaining in Northeast China. In Soviet-controlled areas such as Siberia, Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands, 409,000 people have not been repatriated. After the end of the war, all 479,050 Japanese in Taiwan have been repatriated to their home country. 1,501,120 people have been repatriated from mainland China. Except for a few scattered elements, this is the total number of Japanese in China at the time of surrender. According to news from the Communist-controlled area of North China, some Japanese have joined the Communist army, but their number is small.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Provincial Assembly Decides Not to Advance Central Government Expenses</h3>
<p>Requests Allocation of Stored Gold and Materials</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th] The Taiwan Provincial Assembly invited Taiwan financial and economic experts and all provincial assemblymen on the 9th and 11th, respectively, to hold a financial and economic issues symposium to discuss the "problem of stabilizing the value of the Taiwan dollar." Among them, there was a heated discussion on the matter of the Taiwan Provincial Government advancing expenses for central government agencies stationed in Taiwan. It was decided to "request the Central Government to approve the allocation of gold and materials stored in Taiwan to the Bank of Taiwan for use or sale to cover the expenses of various central government agencies stationed in Taiwan, without the need for the provincial treasury to advance funds, so as not to stimulate the expansion of the Taiwan dollar and affect people's livelihood." The assembly also convened a resident committee meeting on the 12th, which also discussed the matter in detail and unanimously decided to send a telegram to Acting President Li, Premier He Yingqin, President of the Control Yuan Yu Youren, President of the Legislative Yuan Tong Guanxian, and Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun, conveying the above opinions.</p>
<h3>Fujian Military and Public Transportation Is Increasingly Busy, Strengthening Transportation on the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Fuzhou, 11th] Military and public transportation in Fujian is increasingly busy. The Pacification Office has ordered the Fujian Highway Engineering Office to rush to build the road surface of the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road and the mountain tunnel project between Mawei and Luoxing Pagoda in order to strengthen the efficiency of the coastal land transportation from the Min River through Rong, Quan, to Xiamen Port. In order to maintain the safety of vehicles on the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road, the Provincial Security Department has dispatched troops to mobilely suppress scattered bandits, striving to ensure that the entire line is unobstructed. As for the roads in northern Fujian, the road surface and bridges are also mostly unable to bear the burden. The Highway Bureau has sent personnel to Nanping to be responsible for handling reinforcement projects.</p>
<h3>A Cargo Ship Between Guangzhou and Hong Kong Suffers Pirate Robbery</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 12th] On the 10th of this month, fifty pirates carrying Thompson submachine guns and hand grenades robbed a cargo ship traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong. After searching for fourteen hours, they escaped fully loaded and kidnapped six sailors.</p>
<h3>Government Decides to Defend Guangzhou, Guangzhou Holds Important Military Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 12th] Government leaders held an important military conference last night and decided to defend Guangzhou as they defended Shanghai. Acting President Li, Commander of the Central China Military Region Bai Chongxi, Minister of National Defense He Yingqin, Guangzhou Pacification Director Yu Hanmou, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government Xue Yue, and Commander-in-Chief of the Army Zhang Fakui attended the meeting.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Businessmen Talk About: Wuxi's Various Aspects</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] Since the fall of Wuxi, all sectors of this city and Wuxi natives in Shanghai have been extremely concerned about the current situation there. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited businessmen who had recently come to Shanghai from Wuxi by private boat. According to them: Wuxi fell at midnight on April 23rd. The vanguard of the Communist army entered the city after midnight and the next morning. They looked very tired, as if they had come from a long trek, and most of them were sixteen or seventeen-year-old youths. The weapons they carried were rifles and hand grenades. Machine guns were also rare, and there were no heavy weapons such as artillery. After entering the city, because their strength was weak, the security in the city was still the responsibility of the people's self-defense corps. Everything was still peaceful, and there were no robberies. A week later, the Communist army took over the city defense, and the guns and ammunition of the self-defense corps were all confiscated. So far, only a few political workers have entered the city. After the Communist army entered the city, all newspapers were closed. First, the Communist Xinhua News Agency printed telegrams, then after taking over the Da Xi Bao and Min Bao, they published the Sunan Daily, which consisted of two large sheets, all of which were propaganda about the New Democracy and how the Communist army had received Pingjin and crossed the river, etc. Therefore, sales were sluggish. Household registration in the urban area has not yet been investigated, so entry and exit are not restricted. Even if traveling from Wuxi to Shanghai, it is not very difficult to pass through the Communist army's sentry lines along the way.</p>
<p>Wuxi has now been changed to a city. According to Communist personnel chatting with the people of Wuxi, they revealed that they had a lot of receiving work to do, and they didn't know where to start, because most of the receiving personnel were young people and lacked practical experience. Regarding industry, commerce, and finance, on the surface, the shops have all resumed business, but business is sluggish, and the bosses cannot pay salaries. Most of the employees are on unpaid leave. The factories have also resumed work, but the finished products cannot be exported and are mostly sold to enterprises designated by the Communist Party. After the Communist army entered the city, they announced that the Gold Yuan Coupon would be discontinued after May 13, but the shops refused to use it since the Communist army entered the city. The People's Bank is located in the Wuxi County Bank. Silver dollars are listed, the first day the price was 350 yuan for a large head, and the small head was 90% of the large head, and the Eagle Dragon Ocean was 80% of the large head, but there was no exchange. The black market price in the hands of silver dealers was as high as 40,500 yuan. The People's Bank automatically devalued the People's Currency the next day, raising the price of the large head to 450 yuan each, but the black market raised it to 600 yuan.</p>
<p>Entertainment venues are still open as usual, and speculative merchants have opened tea rooms in the city's park hotels and held tea dances, and some Communist soldiers also entered to sightsee. Most of the Communist soldiers are from northern Jiangsu and are interested in electric lights, radios, and movies. They also like rubber shoes and fountain pens. Also, after the Communist army officially took over Wuxi, the local communists from the four villages came to the city to claim credit in formation, but they were disarmed and ordered to reorganize, which greatly disappointed the local communists. Therefore, the four villages are now more peaceful than before, and many residents in the urban area have moved to the countryside, hearing that they are afraid of National Army planes bombing. Trains can pass from Wuxi to Suzhou and Zhenjiang, all of which are military vehicles, and there is no scheduled departure time. Only a few people take the train. None of the buildings inside or outside the city were damaged. The new Wuxi railway station building, built by the two railway bureaus, is also intact.</p>
<h3>The Taste of Being a "Liberated Teacher"</h3>
<p>— He Yun</p>
<p>This is the personal experience of an elementary school teacher who was already exhausted on the escape route. He originally had no strength to escape, as mentioned in the article, but he finally had the heart to abandon his beloved wife and young children and escape. This article is the most urgent appeal he wanted to express after he safely arrived in Qingdao. We are publishing it for the readers.</p>
<p>After that "every family has spring water, every household has weeping willows", the Shandong provincial capital, known as the Little Jiangnan, was "liberated", we, a group of elementary and middle school teachers who "have no permanent property but have a constant heart", were also declared "liberated" in a situation where we had no power to escape. Under the slogan of "doing what one is familiar with" of the lenient policy, we became "again a bride". However, "liberated education" must be close to the masses, so we must also lead students to do various kinds of propaganda to the masses. Therefore, you teachers must be forced to say "the traitorous ×××". But when you are "cursing loudly", your listeners, the elders, are secretly making faces and cursing you "shameless" in their hearts. What exactly are you people? Under the spiritual sympathy, you have received this kind of silent condemnation. May I ask, what kind of taste do you feel in your conscience (if it has not been completely extinguished)?</p>
<p>"Liberated education" is "democratic", so everything must be decided by the students. For example, taking exams and reading books, it's just for reference, it doesn't matter; when you hear the sound of planes, you say enemy planes are coming and stop teaching. As a teacher, you can only comply with "public opinion" and say yes yes yes. If you don't know what's good for you and say half a no, you're guaranteed to be "reported" immediately as "ideologically stubborn, violating democracy, and immediately transferred to × place to relearn." May I ask, how should you deal with this kind of unlimited "democratic" style?</p>
<p>Once, when I was teaching arithmetic, a new student suddenly asked, "Teacher! Why is that 'ten' character called addition?" Such a lightning attack, if it weren't for having three handfuls of magical sand, I would have been knocked down from my horse. Fortunately, at that time, I had a flash of inspiration and asked back, "May I ask, what is your last name, student?" He said, "Zhao." Unexpectedly, I asked again, "Then why is your last name Zhao?" At this time, he stammered and was stumped by me. At that time, I was sure of winning and said slowly, "Then, is your last name Zhao because your father's last name is Zhao?" "Is your father's last name Zhao because your grandfather's last name was Zhao?" Pushing it up like this generation after generation, it proves that your last name Zhao is passed down from your ancestors. As for why the "ten" character is called addition, it is just like your last name Zhao, it is passed down from generation to generation by the person who invented this symbol in the past." So he sat down.</p>
<p>It is true that this may be due to the questions raised by some innocent children under the drive of their desire for knowledge, which do not necessarily contain any malice. However, every time they ask such questions, they clearly show a face full of sneers, especially if you are a teacher who has just been "liberated", you cannot withstand this series of questions, such as: "What is the Taihe Incident?" "What is the Sanwan Incident?" "Why did the teacher want to be a traitor in the past?" These kinds of questions that even the "political commissar" in their school cannot answer and make you both cry and laugh, if they are asked to your face, what taste will you feel?</p>

<h3>Guizhou Provincial Government and Council Decide to Restrict the Import of Cash</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 11th] The Guizhou Provincial Government held a meeting of heads of various agencies yesterday. A detailed review was conducted on the current financial and monetary issues. It was decided to implement three important measures, which the provincial government ordered the Guiyang Municipal Government and the provincial capital police to strictly enforce: (1) The salaries of employees of various agencies in the province must be supplied with cash by the Central Bank. Except for the Central Bank's transportation of cash to the province, any agency, organization, or individual who transports cash to the province will have it confiscated upon discovery. (2) There is a shortage of silver coins in the province, and the circulation in the market is still insufficient. If banks and other financial institutions wish to engage in the business of silver dollar deposit and remittance, they must be able to raise 50,000 silver dollars from other provinces as a fund before they are allowed to operate. Otherwise, they will not be allowed. (3) Recently, checks and crossed checks issued by various banks in Guiyang City have often not been cashed, and they are sold at a large discount when used to purchase goods in the market. This is disrupting the financial system, and will be strictly prohibited from today.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Proposes to Acheson the Formation of an Asian League; We Are Determined to Fully Defend the Freedom of Our Nation and People</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] China today called on the United States to initiate an Asian League, in accordance with the North Atlantic Treaty, to stop communism in the East. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun made this request to US Secretary of State Acheson during a 35-minute meeting. Afterwards, Gu told reporters that China hopes for a regional defense agreement to demonstrate that the concerns of freedom-loving countries are mutually consistent. Acheson expressed sympathetic acceptance of my request but did not make any promises. I told Acheson that the Chinese National Government is determined to do everything possible to defend the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the people. In response to reporters' questions, Gu said, I hope this decision can eliminate the United States' hesitation in adopting a decisive or concrete position on the China issue. Gu did not want to reveal the content of Acheson's conversation, only saying that Acheson mentioned President Truman's statement when he signed the North Atlantic Treaty last month. At that time, the President said that the US government's concern for democracy and freedom is not limited to Europe.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] Ambassador Gu Weijun today asked the United States to provide active and concrete support for the National Government's anti-communist war in order to clear up the concerns and doubts of people in China and other Asian countries that the United States is indifferent to events in Asia. It is heard that Ambassador Gu had a half-hour meeting with Secretary of State Acheson, during which he requested that the United States issue a sympathetic statement to support the National Government and clearly define the moral and material assistance that can be provided to the National Government. After leaving the meeting, Gu told reporters: He explained to Acheson the recent developments in China and the National Government's determination to resist the communists. Gu also said: After the National Government itself made this anti-communist decision, we hope that this move will promote the United States to determine its position on the war in China. According to reports, during the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks, Acheson and other State Department officials stated that the United States would not provide further aid to China. Ambassador Gu added: In terms of concern for peace, China welcomes the North Atlantic Treaty, but there are also concerns because the United States and other signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty have not simultaneously committed to the maintenance of democracy and freedom in China and other important regions. This can be interpreted as the United States' concern for Asian affairs being far less than its concern for the Atlantic region. Even though US officials have repeatedly denied this, and considering the events currently happening in China, coupled with the lack of active US action towards China compared to Europe, Chinese people feel deep concern and doubt. Reporters asked him whether he strongly advocated that Asia should also have a defense treaty similar to the North Atlantic Treaty. Gu replied: Not exactly the same, but there are some indications that the United States is concerned about freedom issues around the world, without any distinction. Gu concluded: Unless the United States can reaffirm its interest, which is no less than that in the North Atlantic Treaty area, Asia and other parts of the world will definitely discuss whether the United States is indifferent to the rampant spread of communism outside the Atlantic Treaty area. Gu added: Acheson expressed great sympathy for his remarks.</p>

<h3>International Relief Organizations Greatly Reduced Activities in China; General Public Deeply Regrets</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Guangzhou, 12th] Many relief organizations in China, whether international, American, or Chinese-led but supported by foreign countries, are discussing their future status. The larger ones, such as the ECA, have provided huge amounts of relief materials in China, and their organizations in China are also very large. While these organizations have benefited countless Chinese people, they will undoubtedly cease operations under the CCP regime. Other relief organizations are willing to continue operating in the CCP-controlled areas, but it remains to be seen whether they will be able to do so, pending the decision of the CCP authorities. The general public deeply regrets that their technical assistance to China will be cut short. The ECA is currently the largest foreign aid organization in China. To date, its aid to China has reached 240 million US dollars directly from foreign countries, and the aid funds obtained from the sale of cotton textiles have also reached 17 million US dollars. The items it supplies to China include rice, petroleum products, cotton, fertilizers, and medicines. The headquarters of the ECA China Mission has now moved from Shanghai to Guangzhou, and its staff, representing 27 nationalities, has also been greatly reduced. The number of American staff has been reduced to 56. Its work in various parts of China has been stopped since the CCP took over. Another American organization is the China Rural Reconstruction Joint Commission. It was established in Nanjing on October 1 last year and soon moved to Guangzhou. To date, it has spent 6.5 million US dollars in China. According to a resolution of the US Congress, this organization will not be allowed to work in the CCP-controlled areas. In addition, it is uncertain whether the World Health Organization, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and the United Nations Children's Fund will be able to continue operating in the CCP-controlled areas. As for the four institutions under the Rehabilitation Affairs Administration of the Executive Yuan, such as the Fisheries Administration, although they are continuing the unfinished tasks of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), there is little certainty that they will be able to continue operating in the CCP-controlled areas.</p>

<h3>Regiment Commander of the 21st Gendarmerie Regiment in Fuzhou Assassinated by Subordinate Company Commander</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Fuzhou, 12th] Wang Hanzhi, regiment commander of the 21st Gendarmerie Regiment, was seriously injured by his subordinate, 9th Company Commander Li Shengwu, in an assassination attempt at 5:00 pm on the 11th. He died in the Fuzhou Provincial Hospital at 10:00 pm. The 9th Company was originally stationed in Quanzhou. After being transferred to Fuzhou, it was merged with the 8th Company. Li Shengwu was ordered to wait for the arrival of new recruits. He had been working at the regimental headquarters for more than three months. Recently, Li became impatient with his empty company commander status and requested to take over the recruits early. Wang refused, saying that it would only take another month of training to complete the task. He asked Li to wait a little longer. Unexpectedly, this tragic incident occurred. Li fled after committing the crime in Wang's private residence and has not been captured. As a result, martial law was declared early at 9:00 pm in Fuzhou City on the 11th. Almost the entire gendarmerie was mobilized, and the press was asked not to publish the news. However, Li has not been found. His elderly father and his wife, whom he married just a year ago, have been taken into custody. Li is from Ji County, Hebei Province. He is tall and strong, and has a violent temper. Regiment Commander Wang is from Hunan Province, very honest, and highly respected by his subordinates and praised by society. Zhu Shaoliang has now ordered a swift investigation to restore military discipline and maintain law and order.</p>

<h3>Special Article: Today's Shanghai Economic Problems</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lixing</p>
<p>Shanghai was originally a city of all evils. Entering a wartime state might reduce the car consumption level of wealthy idlers, rectify bad habits of speculation and extravagance, and also lead to material shortages, worker unemployment, livelihood difficulties, and social unrest. Therefore, today's economic problems in Shanghai are inseparable from political, military, social, and livelihood issues. If economic problems cannot be fully addressed and properly resolved, the impact on society and people's livelihoods and the consequences for politics and the military are predictable. In peacetime, the evil forces of corruption, incompetence, and privileged selfishness are immense, and even wise men cannot compete with them. Now, we should seize this once-in-a-millennium opportunity, based on the factual needs of wartime, to drastically eliminate the evils of speculation, selfishness, and unreasonableness in the upper echelons of society, and prevent the dire consequences of livelihood difficulties at the lower levels. The former belongs to the realm of fiscal and financial measures, while the latter falls within the scope of livelihood economics. Here, I briefly describe what is urgently needed and can be achieved:</p>
<p>1.  Livelihood Economic Problems</p>
<p>Currently, coal and cotton from North China and the Jinpu Railway, and rice from the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the Taihu Lake area cannot come in. Even fish, piglets, vegetables, and firewood from the periphery of Shanghai are scarce or difficult to access due to the shrinking military zone. If this persists for a long time, the necessities of life for more than six million people will face a serious problem. Shanghai is already the outpost of Taiwan. In addition to the news that the Shanghai Municipal Government has requested assistance from the ECA, Taiwan also cannot shirk its responsibility for large-scale supply of coal and rice needed by Shanghai. From a military perspective, if methods can be found to allow rice, grains, vegetables, firewood from the counties east of the Taihu Lake, and fish from the Yangtze River estuary to flow in large quantities, the lives of people in the urban area will immediately feel easier.</p>
<p>Water and electricity should be immediately restricted to save coal. Gasoline can directly replace fuel, so vehicle use should be restricted immediately. More trams and buses can be used for transportation. Except for urgent military supplies, there is no need to use cars for transportation. Banquets should be stopped immediately, and all restaurants should be converted into public canteens to save vegetables, fish, and meat. Rice rations should be reduced. Except for soldiers and laborers, each person should be limited to one bowl of porridge and one bowl of rice.</p>
<p>It is currently the peak fishing season. If fishing can be protected and access facilitated, and if the scope of foodstuff, livestock, and vegetable purchases around Shanghai can be expanded, while economizing on consumption, large-scale cold storage and canning of food should be carried out to meet the needs of hot weather and military emergencies.</p>
<p>In addition to the military having a dedicated organization for overall planning of food supplies, public servants and the general public have unequal wealth and varying levels of storage. When rice becomes as expensive as pearls and firewood as cassia, rice-snatching riots are bound to occur. In addition to seeking supplies from Taiwan and abroad, the government should also conduct district-by-district surveys of private grain storage. When necessary, it should implement unified distribution to make up for shortages with surpluses. Multiple distribution points should also be established to avoid the queues for household rice purchases as seen today. This not only wastes people's time and energy but also creates the impression of a food shortage.</p>
<p>In the future, if the war intensifies and the scope shrinks, some factories will inevitably shut down, and entertainment venues will inevitably close. Short-term training should be given to band members and dancers, who should be organized into comfort and nursing teams to be deployed as needed to boost morale. At that time, the use of non-military and non-official vehicles can be restricted or even prohibited to open up a livelihood for laborers to transport goods by bicycle.</p>
<p>2.  Reform of Finance and Banking</p>
<p>A fixed price of currency is convenient for being a medium of exchange. The currency itself is not for human consumption. In years of war, the value of currency often changes with the political environment. Observing its changes, there is no fixed and fair standard. At the time of the victory of the War of Resistance, what standards were used to determine the ratio of the legal tender to the "reserve currency" and the paper currency issued by the Communist Party to the Gold Yuan? Is it accurate and fair? It is difficult to say. Whether paper or coins, the wider the circulation and the more goods there are, the higher the credit and value will be. Now that the scope has shrunk and materials are lacking, everyone believes that the paper currency is devalued. They do not know that even if the financial revenue and expenditure can be balanced, or if we completely regress to using coins, devaluation is still inevitable. Try standing in the Sahara with a load of jewelry, which is worthless because there is nothing to exchange it for. Since the value of currency changes due to the political environment, and the result of this change is devaluation, the government cannot bear the burden of printing, and the people cannot bear the loss. Investigating the reasons, it is due to the fixed price of currency on the face of the bill – yuan, jiao, and fen. When prices rise and currency devalues, larger denominations must be printed. If it is possible to issue "flexible unit coupons" in a revolutionary manner, printing only numbers such as one, ten, or one hundred without printing the price, and the unit of calculation is specified by the government by order, it can adapt to any political environment. Currency will never inflate, and the people will never suffer losses. Accounting will always be simple. For example, a "flexible unit coupon" with a unit of one is now hypothetically valued at 0.1 silver dollar in Gold Yuan. The government can order that the unit of calculation be 500,000 Gold Yuan. If the 0.1 silver dollar is worth 5 million Gold Yuan one day, the government can change the unit of calculation for the "flexible unit coupon" to 5 million Gold Yuan by order. If the political environment changes and 0.1 silver dollar is only worth 0.1 Gold Yuan, the unit of calculation will also change to 0.1 Gold Yuan. The exchange rate for foreign currency or the link to any other country's currency can also be announced through the unit of calculation without changing the name of the currency or reprinting new coupons with different denominations. The issuance does not need to increase, and people's savings will not be lost. If foreign trade can be controlled to prevent import surplus, then domestic prices will only be related to the unit of calculation and will not affect currency or people's livelihood. As for the name, it can be abbreviated as "flexible coupon," "unit coupon," or any other appropriate name. Whether it is theoretically sound and technically feasible, I hope scholars and experts at home and abroad will not hesitate to advise. However, I feel that we should study and create according to historical evolution and social needs. If the current monetary system of various countries in the world is not reformed, the third world war will inevitably encounter the difficulties we face today.</p>
<p>When the Gold Yuan was issued on August 19 last year, the stipulated capital for banks and firms was 1 million and 500,000. In less than three days, it was reduced by half. When the capital of banks and firms was inspected a month later, the Gold Yuan had devalued five times, equivalent to 50,000 and 25,000 silver dollars, and real estate could be used to offset it. Therefore, banks and firms, in addition to the signboard and facade, did not need to raise additional capital and relied solely on credit to engage in speculation. This was a major disaster for Shanghai. Although Mr. Jiang Jingguo strongly argued against it, the Ministry of Finance did not adopt it. The central government's policies were lenient, and the tigers could not be overthrown, so the economic supervision at that time could not be effective. Now, we can take advantage of the impending war, the reduced speculation, and the opportunity to transfer capital without much dispute, to increase the capital amount of banks and firms, revoke the licenses of those who do not meet the requirements, or order them to merge operations, which may reduce one-third or even half of the banks and firms. After the war, no new licenses will be issued, and their business scope will be strictly examined, so that other good financial measures can be slowly implemented.</p>
<p>In short, if our entire country, from top to bottom, can recognize the times, abandon personal relationships, sacrifice the small self, and take care of the people's livelihood, reform immediately, plan for governance with determination, and save the country and the people, it is not too late.

<p>[United Press Berlin, 12th] The Soviet blockade of Berlin ended at 12:01 AM (Berlin time, 7:01 AM Shanghai time) today. Military vehicles, cars, and jeeps began to speed back and forth on the highway between Helmstedt, on the border of the British and Soviet zones of Berlin. When the time limit for lifting the blockade arrived, the power plant in the Soviet sector of Berlin only provided minimal power, while the Western sector was brightly lit. This was the most joyful night in Berlin since the end of the war. Bars, cafes, and nightclubs were all open and full of customers. Allied pilots at the Western Berlin airport also held celebrations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Berlin, 12th] Berlin is preparing to celebrate the lifting of the blockade today. Schools are closed and most shops are closed. Thousands of civilians will gather in front of the West Berlin City Hall to listen to the celebrations of the military governors of the three Western powers. The West German Constitutional Assembly has sent a delegation to Berlin to participate in the celebration.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 12th] Allied airlift planes continued to land in Berlin every 90 seconds today, not stopping due to the resumption of ground traffic. The West Berlin City Council held a special meeting this morning to discuss the city's plans after the lifting of the blockade. When the British, American, and French governors arrived, the cheers of the citizens outside the venue thundered. Factories in the Soviet sector sounded their sirens in the afternoon to commemorate the "achievement of inter-zonal understanding." At the same time, a mass rally was held in East Berlin to express "the will of the Berlin citizens not to forget the unification of Berlin and Germany." The first train out of Berlin after the blockade was a German inter-zonal passenger train, which left Berlin at 1:30 PM. At the Soviet checkpoints on the borders of Berlin and East and West Germany, Soviet officials were smiling and amiably checking the documents of people and vehicles coming and going. Those who previously suspected that the Soviet Union would ultimately retain were relieved.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 12th] The first West German military train departed at 1:23 AM this morning and arrived at the Charlottenburg station in the British sector of Berlin at 5:30 AM, one hour earlier than scheduled. The train was pulled by a giant locomotive, covered with green branches. There were many British, American, and other Allied journalists on board, led by the British director in charge and Inglis, the director of the transportation department of the British and American joint zone. According to Inglis, the lifting of the blockade will open 12 railway lines between the British and American joint zones and the Soviet zone. In addition, inland water transport can carry at least 4,000 tons of goods to Berlin every day, and the volume of road transport is also considerable.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 12th] The first car after the lifting of the Berlin blockade drove into the city at 1:44 AM local time. The car was driven by Lentel, the manager of the United Press German branch. It is said that the trip was very smooth.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 12th] The first US military train from Frankfurt arrived in Berlin at 9:46 AM this morning. The first German international train left Hanover at 9:10 AM, taking the Weststedt route to Berlin.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 12th] The first Allied cargo train arrived in Berlin this afternoon, carrying 42 tons of coal from the Ruhr region.</p>
<h3>Ruhr Area Control Issue: Will be One of the Main Topics of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 11th] The Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to open in Paris on the 23rd. Western powers' German affairs experts have been busy exchanging views. Experts are scheduled to hold their first meeting next Monday. The participants will include US Ambassador-at-Large Jessup and State Department Advisor Bohlen. British Foreign Office expert Kirkbride-Béchard. Mr. Eyre will chair the French experts' delegation before returning home from the successful conference in Merle.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 12th] The French Foreign Ministry today denied reports in some newspapers that France had asked Britain and the United States to agree to Soviet participation in the control of the Ruhr region's industry. The Foreign Ministry said that the French government has always abided by its agreements with Western countries on the control of the Ruhr region and has never made any new proposals. This issue will be discussed at the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 11th] Reliable sources say that at the Foreign Ministers' Conference opening in Paris on the 23rd of this month, France will propose allowing the Soviet Union to participate in the Allied control of the Ruhr region's coal and steel industry as one of the major concessions to the Soviet Union. When French Foreign Minister Bidault proposed this suggestion at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference two years ago, it was rejected by Bevin. When British Deputy Foreign Minister Kirkbride-Béchard comes to Paris this weekend, French officials will explain that the Soviet Union's participation in Ruhr control is a major concession worth paying for. The French diplomatic community believes that the Soviet Union attaches great importance to participating in Ruhr control, and at least hopes that the Soviet Union can send an observer to participate in the Ruhr industrial control organization. The French diplomatic community believes that in order to gain a foothold in the Ruhr control system, the Soviet Union may make surprising concessions at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is rumored that the Soviet Army General Staff has informed the Kremlin that they must learn about the actual situation in the Ruhr region. Some people in Paris have suggested that the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe establish a United Nations-led Ruhr Coal Bureau and Steel Bureau. This would allow the Soviet Union to send an observer to the Ruhr. The French diplomatic community expects that Britain will firmly oppose any suggestion to allow the Soviet Union to intervene in the Ruhr, but believes that the United States may support the French suggestion.</p>
<h3>East German Constitution in Drafting</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 12th] East German leader and Chairman of the People's Council, Grotewohl, claimed yesterday that it is not difficult to find a compromise between the West German Constitution and the East German Constitution currently being drafted by the German People's Committee.

Grotewohl also said that the People's Committee he leads will not support a loose federation composed of East and West German states. Apart from this, the People's Committee is willing to support any compromise constitution that ensures the unification of Germany.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 11th] Chairman of the Bonn Constitutional Assembly, Adenauer, arrived here by plane this afternoon and told reporters that the Bonn Assembly will refuse to have contact with the so-called "People's Council" in the Eastern sector, because this People's Council does not have a democratic constitution. Adenauer also said that the new constitution will be announced within two weeks, and elections will be held immediately after the announcement, so that the government can begin to be established this summer.</p>

Answering a reporter's question at a press conference on whether India would participate in the defense alliance proposed by Philippine President Quirino, Nehru said that due to the various wars currently occurring in Asia, it would be extremely difficult to implement this alliance. Unless the conflicts in Indonesia and other places are resolved, there is no possibility of this treaty being established. Nehru also stated that India is determined not to enter into a treaty with the "Power Bloc". However, he said that the Asian Conference held in New Delhi in January could prove the value of "regional cooperation, consultation, and friendship."</p>

<h3>Dewey Speaks Upon Arrival in England: Suspects Soviet Motives</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 11th] New York Governor and former Republican presidential candidate Dewey told reporters here today that the resolution of the Berlin issue may be a trap, and he hopes that Western countries will pay close attention to whether there is indeed a trap when preparing to negotiate with the Soviet Union on the German issue.

<h3>Reporter Calls on Government to Change Asian Policy</h3>
<p>A Great Tragedy is Brewing in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 11th] Newsweek reporter Isaac said in a speech at the Reporters Guild today that another great tragedy is brewing in Southeast Asia. The United States is indifferent to Southeast Asia and has failed to understand the political changes there. During my work in the Pacific, I found that the people there are suspicious and distrustful of the United States, and even openly hostile. If the United States fails to change its current policies, Southeast Asia will inevitably fall into the arms of communism. The United States is poisoned by Europe-firstism and does not know that Western Europe has become the tail of the Asian continent. The Indonesian people are skeptical of the United States because the United States has always supported the Dutch colonial policy.</p>
<h3>The UN Political Committee to Begin Debate on the Disposition of Italian Colonies; Sub-Committee Approves Anglo-Italian Joint Proposal</h3>

It remains uncertain whether the Anglo-Italian joint proposal can secure the necessary two-thirds majority for passage in the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>No Changes in Civilian Control of US Occupation Affairs in Japan</h3>
<p>War Department Denies Military Officials Will Replace Civilian Staff</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 11th] The US War Department has no plans to replace civilian officials in the Japanese occupation authority with military officers. The War Department's Civil Affairs Division issued this statement today, denying news reports from Tokyo. The report claimed that General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in the Far East, planned to replace civilian officials in Japan with military officers. The New York Times carried a dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th, stating that MacArthur was altering his policy regarding civilian governance. In response to inquiries from various newspapers, a spokesman for the Civil Affairs Division issued the above statement. It was pointed out that, while MacArthur has the authority to take such action, he has not indicated to the War Department that such a change is under consideration. The current plan for personnel in the occupation of Japan and Germany is to replace military personnel being transferred from the two countries with civilian staff wherever possible.</p>
<h3>President Truman Reaffirms Support for UN Institutions; Expresses Hope Other Nations Will Uphold Obligations Under the Charter</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] President Truman stated on the 12th that the United States remains fully supportive of the United Nations, even though the US is disappointed with the security organization. Truman made the above statement in presenting to Congress a 303-page report on US participation in the United Nations in 1948.</p>
<p>The report was prepared by the State Department. Secretary of State Acheson stated in the preface, "The United States has no sound reason to lose faith in the United Nations," but at the same time, he pointed out, "The United States and other nations are deeply disappointed that the United Nations has not become a sufficient instrument for safeguarding peace, given the failure of some nations to uphold their obligations under the Charter." He stated that, due to the "inadequacy" of the world organization in security matters, the United States and other nations have had to conclude the Atlantic Treaty and take other steps outside the United Nations, but their goals are consistent with those of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Today's Situation Is Not What It Used to Be</p>
<p>Truman explained Acheson's report, saying, "If the United Nations has disappointed us in safeguarding security, if we have had to take supplementary measures to meet the real and potential threats to our security, it is not because the United States has not made a loyal effort to bring the United Nations to perfection. The world today is not the world we hoped for when the San Francisco Conference closed four years ago." But Truman emphasized that the United States still "supports the United Nations in all respects." He stated that the five permanent members of the Security Council, who possess the veto power, have a special obligation to uphold the Charter and "peacefully resolve their international disputes." "The fulfillment of these obligations," he said, "implies national self-restraint in international relations." He stated, "The United States recognized its Charter obligations in 1948, and "we will continue to recognize these obligations, and we have the right to demand that other nations recognize these obligations as well."</p>
<h3>Longtou and Jiuzhou Battle Fiercely; Compete for Democracy Cup Today</h3>
<p>Jiuzhou and Longtou will clash in the Nanshi Democracy Cup today, starting at 5:00 PM. While this match is not the final, its practical importance is equivalent to a final. Looking at Longtou's past performance, they won 2-1 against Daxia, drew 2-2 with Zhongyi, and defeated Huaguang 2-0. Currently, they lead with the highest score of five points. If they can defeat Jiuzhou today, they still have two matches against Pan and Samsung, with only Samsung being a tough hurdle, requiring a hard fight. If Jiuzhou wins today, they will have two remaining matches against Pan and Zhongyi. Although Zhongyi is a local team in Nanshi, their strength is slightly weaker than Jiuzhou's. Jiuzhou may already have a 70% chance of winning the championship. If today's match ends in a draw, it would be equivalent to creating an opportunity for Zhongyi because Zhongyi beat Samsung 3-1 and drew with Longtou and Huaguang 2-2, also earning four points. Their remaining three matches are against Pan, Daxia, and Jiuzhou, and they can at least add four more points. In the opening match, Samsung suffered a 1-3 defeat to Zhongyi because Gao Baozheng and others were absent and they played with only ten players, currently ranking fourth with only three points. However, if Samsung can make a final effort and defeat Biguang and Longtou, the winner of the Democracy Cup is still a mystery.</p>
<p>After Gao Xiuqing registered with Longtou, he did not attend the first two matches, making people doubt whether Xiuqing could help Longtou. However, Xiuqing suddenly appeared in Longtou's third match against Huaguang, knowing that Huaguang was a difficult team to deal with and that without Xiuqing's presence, they would not be able to defeat the enemy. In that match, Longtou actually won by two goals, and Xiuqing's contribution cannot be denied. At the same time, Xiuqing's appearance in Longtou reveals their ambition to win the silver cup. The other day, the United Team challenged Sanwu. Apart from Meng Yiliang and Liu Tiyin, the rest of the Jiuzhou team in the United Team are unknown, which is precisely to conserve their strength in preparation for today's battle. Therefore, today will be a tough and all-out match. The referee is Wang Lin, and the linesmen are Ni Shiyao and Tan Rongsheng. To maintain order in the stadium, today's tickets are sold for one million yuan. The lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiuzhou</p>
<p>Huang Shijie</p>
<p>Zhang Fenggang Zhang Yuanzhi Jiang Qing</p>
<p>Zhang Renyi Qian Changrong Fu Tang</p>
<p>Jin Lusheng Luo Shoufu Meng Yiliang Gu Yisa Xu Guoping Liu Tiyin</p>

<h3>First Division Table Tennis League; Hualian Barely Beats You Yi</h3>
<p>Three More Second Division Matches Continue Today</p>
<p>In the fourth Table Tennis League, Hualian faced You Yi in the first division at the Guohuo Table Tennis Room the day before. Neither side played with their full strength. In the first set, You Yi's Zhu Jinhai, although facing fierce attacks from Lu Wenliang, relied on his solid defense to prevent the opponent from succeeding. Lu was defeated by him. Jinhai's short hits in this match were excellent, making it difficult to win the first set. In the second set, You Yi sent Yu Chunrong to face Hualian's Li Zhen. Yu's blocks and short blocks near the net had excellent landing points; however, Li Zhen was an all-around player who calmly returned the shots with ease. Yu was unable to parry and lost in two straight sets. In the third set, Hualian's Yang Zhixiong fought hard against Zhu Zhongsun. Yang had the advantage in the first game, but ultimately lost 22-24. He was unable to hold on in the second game and retired. In the fourth set, You Yi's Qi Wenyuan was far from his opponent and lost 0-2 to Hualian captain Zhang Zhihong. In the final decisive set, Hualian's chopper Pan Rixi happened to meet You Yi's hitter Shen Airen. Pan chopped and Shen hit, and the battle was fierce. Shen won the first set, and the audience was worried for Pan. Unexpectedly, Shen was slightly careless in the second set, and Pan managed to tie the score. The third set was the crucial moment for both sides. Pan Rixi remained calm, and the balls he chopped had an unusual spin. Shen's continuous hits failed, and he also lost his strength and retreated in disappointment, losing 1-2. As a result, Hualian barely won 3-2, which can be said to be dangerous.</p>
<p>Among the Second Division matches, the battle between Yi Bu Yangbao and You Si was particularly fierce, with both sides being evenly matched. It was a pity that You Si's main player Dai Lingxu was defeated, changing the overall situation. In the end, Yangbao relied on captain Jin Zhaomin to defeat You Si veteran Fang Shirui in two straight sets, and the entire team won the final victory 3-2. The results of the two matches and the previous matches are recorded below:</p>
<p>Two Match Results</p>
<p>(Hualian) Score (You Yi)</p>
<p>Lu Wenliang 1-2 Zhu Jinhai</p>

In Division B2, the seeded Zhaoshang will face the strong team Xinyi, and there will be a fierce battle. Zhaoshang has already lost once. In the following matches, they can only win and cannot lose. Winning means they still have a chance to be selected, while losing means they will have to give up their position. Although Xinyi has no hope of winning the championship, they will do their best to compete because the ranking is important. The order of today's matches is recorded below:</p>
<p>Wuxing vs. Mingxing (Third Division B) 7:00 PM Jinmen</p>
<p>Zhaoshang vs. Xinyi (Second Division B) 7:00 PM Xinyi</p>

<p>Next, Pingping played against Hong Qi. Hong Qi's Shu Jiayi scored two consecutive baskets, opening the scoring. Pingping refused to be outdone, and Song Lianxiang scored four points each with two free throws, tying the score. Zhi Ang and Jin Kang exchanged free throws for five, seven, and three ties. After that, Pingping became very active, scoring eight points. Hong Qi tried to catch up but failed. In the first half, Pingping led 15-13, a difference of one basket. In the second half, Pingping continued to be active, but Hong Qi also scored a lot, making it 19-20. Then they turned the situation around with 23-22.

<h3>Authorities Plan to Replenish the City's Food Supply; Establish Food Procurement Offices in Suburban Areas; Specific Measures to Be Decided at Meeting This Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] In order to replenish the city's food supply, municipal authorities have decided to establish food procurement offices in suburban areas such as Nanxiang, Huangdu, Songjiang, Sijing, and Zhujiajiao, specializing in the procurement of food. Yesterday, the authorities decided on two basic principles after consultation: (1) Grain merchants will raise funds to purchase grain on their own. The grain obtained will be privately owned by the grain merchants, but the quantity must be reported to the government for registration for statistical purposes. (2) If the grain merchants are unable to raise sufficient funds, they may resell the purchased grain to the Food Emergency Procurement Committee, allowing them to obtain legitimate profits. The prices will be uniformly announced by the municipal government. Representatives from the municipal government, the Central Bank, the Food Emergency Procurement Committee, and the Grain Merchants Association will hold another meeting at the municipal government at 9:00 AM today to discuss and decide on the specific procurement measures.</p>

(2) While the defense war is one matter, the development and construction of Greater Shanghai must still be carried out with a long-term vision. (3) Political innovation and construction projects require the cooperation of scholars, experts, and all citizens. Therefore, it was decided to establish a municipal advisory group.

<h3>Police Department Thoroughly Investigates Illegal Rice Merchants; Punishes Severely According to Martial Law; Those with Serious Circumstances Will Be Subject to the Death Penalty</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Since the Municipal Police Department was ordered to strictly enforce martial law and executed five silver dollar vendors who disrupted financial order last week, the fluctuating silver dollar price has stabilized. However, the price of rice, which is related to the people's livelihood, has suddenly risen sharply in recent days. The door-to-door price has reached 50 million yuan per shi, equivalent to 12.5 silver dollars, which is more than double the price of last week. Given the current extraordinary period, the Police Department believes that some rice merchants are disregarding the law and are obviously engaging in price gouging, hoarding, and manipulation. Therefore, the Police Department dispatched personnel yesterday to conduct a thorough investigation. If solid evidence is found, they will be severely punished according to martial law. Those with serious circumstances will be subject to the death penalty.</p>
<h3>General Headquarters Formulates Provisional Measures for Remittances and Cash Transfers to Shanghai</h3>

For each remittance below 500 million, the total amount paid out each day will also be limited to 500 million yuan. Both the remitter and the recipient must fill in their real names and addresses. Remittances with the same name and address will be treated as one remittance. (2) For cash carried to Shanghai from other regions, each person must not carry more than 500 million Gold Yuan. If the excess is discovered, the excess portion will be handed over to the Central Bank for storage and issued a three-month fixed deposit certificate, which will be returned without interest upon maturity. (3) If government agencies and industrial and commercial enterprises in other regions must remit excess funds to Shanghai through the Central Bank or carry excess cash to Shanghai for legitimate purposes, they must first submit accurate supporting documents to the Political Affairs Committee of the General Headquarters for approval of the amount and issuance of a certificate, and then proceed with the remittance or transfer.

<h3>Merged Public and Private Radio Stations; Only Fifteen Remain</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The radio broadcasting industry flourished in the city after the victory, with the establishment of as many as 30 public and private radio stations. Last year, in order to implement unified management, the authorities approved 12 KC for public radio stations and 15 KC for private radio stations (KC is the abbreviation for kilocycles, which refers to the broadcasting frequency). However, as the situation has become more urgent recently, the military authorities believe that it is necessary to strengthen the management of the broadcasting industry and ordered that the number of public and private radio stations be reduced by half. After discussions at various radio stations, some also believe that advertising customers have decreased and expenses have increased, making consolidation necessary. Therefore, it was decided that their original names would remain, but their operations would be merged into another radio station. After the city's radio stations adopted this cooperative broadcasting method, there are currently only six KC public radio stations and eight KC private radio stations, totaling only fifteen, in addition to Shanghai Radio Station.</p>

<h3>Active Gold Market Trading</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the gold market was active because, after days of flatness, all parties were eager for movement. Buyers emerged one after another, flourishing like fish in water. The morning opened at 2.25 billion, falling to 2.2 billion, then rising all the way to 2.37 billion by the closing bell. In the afternoon, due to the abundance of cash, sentiment continued to be optimistic, opening at 2.4 billion and rising gradually to close at 2.45 billion. At the last quarter of an hour, the Central Bank, at a price of 2.456 billion, entrusted Dadecheng Gold Shop to sell 13 large bars, driving up the price by 90 million.</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Market Unreportable; Exchange Rates Close</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's silver dollar market was quiet and unreportable.

In the afternoon, the situation tightened, with most firms not selling. The buying and selling distance for gold and silver exchange rates yesterday had closed to 3 yuan, with the lowest being 44 yuan and 47 yuan, the highest being 48 yuan and 51 yuan, and the average remaining between 45 yuan and 50 yuan. The reason for the disparity is nothing more than the variety of silver dollars. The usual transaction method is to calculate various versions of silver dollars on a 3-3-3 basis: 30% "big head" dollars, 30% "small head" dollars or "junk boat" dollars, and 30% miscellaneous foreign dollars.

<h3>Market Stock Low, Sales Active; Rice Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The problem of the rice market in the southern city has been resolved, trading has resumed, and prices have risen. Japonica rice is being uniformly quoted at 40 million.

New prices were repeatedly created at the beginning of the market. Lao Che once reached 11.5 million, but the market gave some back at high prices and settled at 11 million. Bingchuan 10 million.</p>

However, the sales were very sluggish. 42-count Blue Phoenix was at the edge of the 800 million mark, 21-count Double Horse was at the edge of the 500 million mark, and others were stable.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market continued to be weak. Many yarn factories are issuing employees with fine cloth on hand as wages and salaries. The market is flooded with Longtou fine cloth from scattered merchants. Traffic to and from various places is still blocked, so in addition to sporadic transactions from single merchants, large-scale wholesale transactions by local merchants have come to a halt. Therefore, the shouts in the market are becoming scarce, and prices are hovering downward. Longtou fine cloth retreated from 17.4 million to 17 million, and Sijunzi serge opened at 18.6 million, then fell to 17.6 million, a drop of 800,000 compared to the previous day.

<h3>Bizarre Murder at the Zhaoshang Third Wharf: Female Corpse Found Lying in Camphor Wood Box, Neck Tied with Rope, Wounds on Hands</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a yellow camphor wood box was discovered next to Iron Gate No. 4 at the Zhaoshang Third Wharf (i.e., Jinliyuan Wharf) on Shangqiao Street, Zhongshan East Second Road. Sun Shouguan, a nearby cigarette vendor, reported it to Guard Constable Cui Yushan. The constable summoned Wharf Policeman Yang Sen to help carry the box into the office outside the iron gate. The resident guard Captain Lu, together with the Water Police Inspection Office, tried to open the box, and found a female corpse lying inside. She appeared to be in her thirties, with a round face and long hair. She was wearing a white vest on her upper body, red floral pants on her lower body, and light yellow socks. A hemp rope was tied around her neck, and there were wounds on both hands. The corpse was placed on a cotton mattress, with an old towel and blanket beside her. A blue Yin Dan Shi Lin cheongsam was covering her body. Her limbs were contracted. The guard constable immediately reported it to the local Yimiao Police Station. Police Chief Zhang Changqi personally, together with Criminal Division Chief Song Shaomei, led a number of policemen to the scene for investigation. Shortly after, the General Bureau was informed and the Chief of the Murder Division, Wu Futang, and police officers from the Photography Division arrived one after another. After photographing the box and the corpse, they transported the female corpse to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to await examination by the District Prosecutor's Office. Meanwhile, they are strictly arresting the murderer for investigation and prosecution. Afterwards, Chief Song said that the case likely occurred in a hotel. The rope around the neck clearly indicated strangulation. The time of death was at midnight, and the box corpse was moved to the location after the curfew was lifted at dawn. As for the wounds on the hands, they may have been caused by violent struggles when the attack happened. It is currently difficult to determine whether the case is a murder for money or related to a love affair.</p>

<h3>Recent Events of "Double Gun" Eighth Sister</h3>
<p>--Hengyang Guest</p>
<p>If you remember the guerilla mother Zhao Laotai in Shandong, you will surely be reminded of "Double Gun" Huang Bamei, who was once a powerful figure in western Zhejiang. It seems that times have changed in the past three years, and it is difficult to find news about this female hero in newspapers and magazines. On my return trip from Hangzhou this time, I made a detour to Pinghu and, together with Chen, the deputy director of the local grain and food department, organized a Huang Bamei interview team. The members included central, provincial, and county-level personnel, as well as military personnel, newspaper reporters, photographers, and ladies, and on a sunny morning, we boarded a special car and set off towards Zhapu.</p>
<p>An Ideal Family</p>
<p>Zhapu has a small earthen city, said to have been built during the Ming Dynasty to defend against the Japanese pirates. It faces the sea and overlooks Huangshan, with beautiful mountains and clear waters, and pleasant scenery. Huang Bamei lives at No. 44 Zongguan Alley, east of the city. It is a two-courtyard, three-room bungalow combining Chinese and Western styles. Inside and outside the living room, there are also celebrity calligraphy and paintings, as well as photos presented by famous Chinese and foreign figures. The windows are bright and the tables are clean, elegant and solemn. Her husband, Xie Yousheng, is 56 years old this year, tall and with a kind attitude. During the Anti-Japanese War, he served as a battalion commander under her command and made great contributions. She originally had three sons and one daughter. The eldest son was killed by the Japanese gendarmerie, the second son, Zong'an, is a farmer, the third son, Zongguo, is currently studying at Hangzhou Zhongzheng Middle School, and her daughter, Ande, is studying at Zhapu Primary School. Although there are not many people in her family, she has many servants and two female secretaries. When we arrived, she was slightly unwell, so Miss Wang Shuying, the secretary, entertained us first. After a while, she and her husband also appeared before us. After Deputy Director Chen introduced us, we began to chat with each other. She spoke of fighting guerrilla warfare with great interest, laughing heartily from time to time. What impressed us the most was that every move of her and her husband was mutually respectful, free, happy, peaceful, and joyful, filling this ideal family.</p>
<p>Her Prestige Never Diminishes</p>
<p>Huang Bamei, also known as Baimei, courtesy name Baiqi, is 44 years old this year. She is short and stout, with a strong physique, sincere to others, generous in her actions, and especially good at talking. No one would believe that she was originally an illiterate female hero. In the past, she engaged in the salt business, traveling between Pinghu and Zhapu, and was keen on public welfare, and was deeply loved by the villagers. During the Anti-Japanese War, because of her contributions to the country, after the victory, she was honored as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Council. Because of her far-reaching reputation, Chinese and foreign people came to visit her almost every day without interruption, so she built the Huangshan Reception Center on the top of Huangshan, specially to entertain guests. This time, we went on a tour of Huangshan, and she happily hired a car to go with us. That day happened to be the incense festival, and the pedestrians were like weaving. Wherever the road passed, the common people stood at attention and saluted, and only dispersed when her car was far away. It is said that these common people were mostly her former cadres. In addition to a part being placed in the county security police force and the township security class, the rest were either farming or doing business. If she gave an order, they could still be concentrated within an hour, which shows that her prestige is undiminished.</p>
<p>Cultivating the Second Generation</p>
<p>Because she felt the pain of being illiterate, after the victory, she invested solely in building a school building and founded Zhapu Complete Primary School. In order to further cultivate the seedlings of the next generation, she founded Haifeng Middle School the year before last (Haifeng is taken from her Haifeng Guerrilla). The teachers were part-time teachers from the local National Fisheries School. Every Monday, she must personally come to the school to give a spiritual speech. "Loyalty to the country and filial piety to the nation" is the theme of her speech, and it is also the goal of her life and work. Sometimes she also brings many books and stationery to distribute to poor students. She said: "The children all call me Mr. Huang, but I am not qualified to be their teacher. On the contrary, they can all read and write, but I am illiterate." He talked about the fact that 90% of the people in Zhapu are illiterate, and that he plans to use their spare time to establish public schools so that every out-of-school adult and woman has the opportunity</p>
<p>to study; she said with a very happy mood and very firmly: "From now on, among the girls under the age of seven in Zhapu, you will no longer find a second Huang Bamei who is illiterate."</p>
<p>She has indeed helped the local government directly and indirectly in many places, such as last winter, she mobilized the people to collectively complete the grain, urged her husband to take up the post of Zhapu Town Mayor, providing relief to refugees, building roads, etc., which were quite successful. She hopes that peace will come soon so that the people can have a chance to breathe. She said that she will hide in the forest springs with her husband and children for the rest of her years.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou City Kidnapping Case: Lover Conspires to Kidnap Wealthy Timber Merchant, Main Culprit Wu Jinrong Executed by Firing Squad, Female Accomplice Lin Lihua Sentenced to Five Years</h3>
<p>On April 26th, at 6:00 PM, the Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office executed a bandit. The bandit, Wu Jinrong, was arrested for the kidnapping of Jian'ou timber merchant Wang Runquan on November 15th of last year. Also arrested was the bandit's lover, Lin Lihua. After their capture, the Fuzhou Police Department transferred the two suspects to the Fujian Security Command for interrogation. The Command determined that the bandit was suspected of being a communist spy and transferred the case to the Fuzhou Special Criminal Court for trial. After the Special Criminal Court was ordered to disband, the Security Command continued to handle the case. The Command sentenced Wu Jinrong to death for kidnapping and demanding ransom, in accordance with the law. The accomplice, Lin Lihua, had her sentence reduced to five years of imprisonment. The case was then transferred to the Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office for review, which upheld the original sentence.</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM, Lou Jingshou, the chief military judge of the Pacification Commissioner's Office's Military Law Department, brought Wu Jinrong for trial. The temporary court was set up at Banshanting on Pingshan Mountain. Chief Judge Lou presided over the trial, with the head of the General Affairs Section and the company commander of the guard company as assessors. Wu was escorted to the trial by eight armed guards, his hair unkempt and without a hat, wearing a white shirt and grass-green military trousers. Two guards supported him as he walked to the dock. The chief military judge asked his name and age before reading out his crimes and announcing that he was to be executed today. The condemned man listened with a pale face, vehemently proclaiming his innocence and detailing his crimes to the military judge, claiming his lover was the instigator. He requested a final meeting with his imprisoned lover, Lin Lihua, but the request was denied. The court asked if he had any last words. He requested pen and paper and quickly wrote a letter to his lover, Lin Lihua. The court gave him two slices of salted beef, a bottle of liquor, and two steamed buns. After a frenzied feast, he was escorted away from Pingshan, out of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and onto Beida Road, heading to the execution ground in the northern suburbs. At 6:00 PM, he arrived at the Longyaoqi execution ground and was shot. The first bullet missed a vital organ, and he did not die immediately. A second shot was fired, finally ending his life. The local headman was instructed to provide a coffin and bury Wu's body. The original announcement from the Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office, No. 69, is recorded below. It is said that the female accomplice Lin Lihua, upon hearing the news in prison, was overcome with grief and sought to meet Wu before her release.</p>
<p>Indictment</p>
<p>"This case concerns the kidnapping and ransom of merchant Wang Runquan of Jianlong Timber Firm on Xiahang Road in this city. The perpetrators, Wu Jinrong and Lin Lihua, have been apprehended. After successive interrogations by the Security Command and this Commissioner's Office, it is clear that Lin Lihua is an accomplice and shall be sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Lin Gemin remains at large and will be dealt with separately upon capture. The perpetrator Wu Jinrong colluded with the fugitive Lin Gemin to commit kidnapping and demand ransom, which he confessed to without reservation. In accordance with Article 8, Paragraph 1, Section 9 of the Martial Law and Article 2, Section 9 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, he is sentenced to the maximum penalty. The perpetrator will be brought forward today to verify his identity and be executed by firing squad as a warning. All military and civilians are hereby notified. Details are as follows: Bandit Wu Jinrong, male, age 27, from Jian'ou, Fujian Province, is to be executed by firing squad. April 26th, 38th year of the Republic of China, Director Zhu Shaoliang." The details of the case are recounted as follows:</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>The main culprit Wu Jinrong and the female accomplice Lin Lihua met when Wu was a teacher at Jian'ou Middle School. Wu had also taught at Jian'ou Pei Han Middle School for a time, and Hua's cousin, Lin Gemin, was a student at the school, so they were familiar. Wu planned to go to Nanjing for treatment of tuberculosis, and Hua was also in Fuzhou to avoid an arranged marriage. Wu, despite being married, still had an unresolved connection with Hua. After arriving in Fuzhou, Wu stayed at the Academy Affiliated Middle School dormitory at No. 3 Xueyuan Road, where he was visited by Lin Gemin and his sister. They often went out together. Hua initially resided at her uncle Zhou Jianzhen's house. Zhou Jianzhen also owned the Jianlong Timber Firm at No. 182 Shanghang Road. Wang Runquan, who was kidnapped, was in Fuzhou to sell timber and was staying at Zhou's house. Wu and Lin, both from Jian'ou, learned of Wang's wealth and conspired to extort money. With Hua's insider information, they changed their plans several times. On November 4th of last year, at 5:00 PM, Wu waited at the entrance of the Dongya Song Stage. Lin Gemin called Wang Runquan from the Dazhong Automobile Company on Zhongping Road. Once everything was arranged, Lin rushed to Xiaoqiaotou to await Hua's news. When Hua informed him that Wang had taken the bait and gone to the meeting, Wu's car arrived at Xiaoqiaotou at the same time. Wu signaled Lin to board the car. The car drove to Nanmendou. The driver asked Lin and Wu where they were going. Wu pointed towards Wushan Road and told him to drive. After passing the Xiaoliuxiang Road intersection by a dozen steps, he told the driver to stop. He immediately took Wang out of the car. After the car turned around and drove away, he forced Wang to a small path towards Xiaoliu Bay. After they went upstairs, he forced Wang to write and sign a check for 20 billion yuan. Afterwards, Lin and Wu moved the stairs to another location and slept downstairs. The next day, they sent a letter while Hua gathered information. Knowing that the Zhou family had received Wang's letter, they sent a stranger to Zhou Jianzhen on the 5th to collect the money. However, Wang did not have that much money at Zhou's place, and Zhou refused. Wu and Lin went upstairs again to talk to Wang. When Wu and Lin's threats were ineffective, they sent a letter directly to Zhou Jianzhen on the 6th, threatening him in the name of the "16th Column of the Chinese Communist Party," demanding that Zhou pay 20 billion yuan on Wang's behalf. They spoke with the language of communists, spreading alarmist rumors, and threatening Zhou as well. As soon as they finished speaking, the landlord, Lin Zhengshi, suddenly came upstairs. Because there were farm tools upstairs, Zhengshi came up to retrieve them. Seeing Wang, he asked Wu and Lin who he was. Wu said he was a sick friend who was staying there temporarily. He immediately escorted Wang downstairs. After Zhengshi retrieved the tools, they brought him back upstairs and placed the stairs back. After Wang returned upstairs, he accidentally discovered a small door when he moved the farm tools. He quickly covered it with other objects to use for escape. After sitting there for a long time, he heard loud snoring downstairs. Wang got up and intentionally made noise, testing whether they were asleep. In the past, every time there was noise upstairs, they would cough or make the sound of a gun being cocked. Wang walked around, but the snoring continued. Still unsure, Wang raised his hand and threw a tile from the roof, but there was still no movement. Still, Wang did not dare to move rashly. But he opened the small door and felt around, discovering a rafter on the corner of the door that he could use as a foothold. Two steps away, he saw a ladder leaning against the wall. Wang, overjoyed to find a way out, waited for dawn. At dawn, he heard the sound of brushing teeth downstairs, followed by footsteps, and then silence. Wang decided to escape. He stepped out of the small door, climbed down the ladder carefully, and saw no one in the hall. He quickly ran to the front door and encountered no one. At Nanmendou, he hired a car and left on his own. Wang escaped and immediately called the police, requesting protection. The next day, Wu sent someone with the check to the Zhou family to collect the money. Wang and Zhou planned to detain him, but Hua's insider, in the blink of an eye, warned the messenger, who escaped. After Lin Lihua was arrested, because of her deep love for Wu Jinrong, she claimed to only know Wu, but their relationship was superficial. She claimed Wu had gone to Nanjing and was not in Fuzhou. She also tried to mislead the investigation. However, she vehemently denied being the "insider" in this case. She also used the name "Liu Yukang" in place of Wu Jinrong's. After extensive interrogation by the police department, and after finding a note on Lihua's person that read: "Lihua: You said you would go to the movies next Monday night, but I can't wait. How about going together on Sunday (tomorrow)? I hope you will give me an answer. Goodbye! Sincerely, Zhiming, Saturday afternoon," they determined that the person who wrote this note must be one of the main culprits. After questioning all those involved, they learned that the main culprit was Wu Jinrong, currently residing at No. 3 Xueyuan Road, Qiaotouweiban, Guanglufang. On the afternoon of November 13th, Director Li Yiyun sent Ma Zuhui to lead detectives to arrest him. After arriving, they discovered Wu was not at home, but his luggage was there. They also learned that Wu was about to leave Fujian. This was a crucial moment. Ma quickly consulted with those lying in wait. Detectives were stationed nearby, and a white paper was posted on the door. As soon as the main culprit returned home, those lying in wait would tear off the white paper as a signal. After waiting for two hours, at about 3:00 PM, a young man in a Ma Gong's military uniform and wearing a military officer's commemorative badge arrived from Guanglufang. After getting out of the car, he hurried into the house. The white paper on the door was immediately torn off. Detectives rushed forward and arrested him, sending him to the Fuzhou Police Department. After interrogation, Wu confessed to the kidnapping without hesitation, but refused to reveal Lin's whereabouts.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Northwest</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yang Guangjie</p>
<p>Beyond the coastal provinces, China also has a vast area - Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan. These provinces, together with Xinjiang, include a population of about 100 million. Among these 100 million people are Han, Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>As the center of these provinces, Lanzhou, Gansu, is full of local flavor. All the houses are built entirely of earth, and even the roof tiles are made of mud. The city's streets are similar to those of other Chinese cities, a center of trade, densely packed with vendors selling gorgeous Xinjiang carpets, Turkish skullcaps, Shanghai cotton fabrics, and all sorts of goods. The only means of transportation here is the mule-drawn four-wheeled cart. Not to mention cars, even vehicles with pneumatic tires are rarely seen. Not far outside the city is the Yellow River, with waterwheels built along the banks, but these waterwheels do not turn until the spring floods. These waterwheels are the only tool for irrigating the fields. The villages along the coast are very poor, and even in winter, the children have no clothes to wear.</p>
<p>The general manager of Gansu Province Highway, Hu Huafu, a Swede who has been doing business in China for many years, believes that the CCP will not invade the Northwest. What about the Chinese people? They also do not want a communist society in China.</p>
<p>Based on religious relations, the Hui people are the most opposed to the Communist Party. They are willing to continue fighting the CCP. Although they are not large in number, they all control military power and govern the provinces of Qinghai and Ningxia, and part of Xinjiang.</p>

<h3>Impoverished Women's Maternity Assistance Faces Suspension: Readers Launch Silver Dollar Donation Campaign; Deep Appreciation for Suggestions from Chang Le Ju Resident; Appeals to All Sectors for Generous Donations</h3>
<p>To the esteemed gentlemen of the Shen Bao service column: I am a long-time reader of your esteemed newspaper and deeply admire the efforts and significant achievements of your column in serving the community. In particular, the impoverished women's maternity assistance program, in cooperation with the city's major hospitals, benefits the impoverished and promotes new methods of childbirth, ensuring the safety of mothers and infants, contributing to the nation, and holding profound significance! My heart is willing, but my resources are limited. Although I have made occasional donations in the past, the amount has always been very small and insignificant.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read the urgent appeal published in your column and learned that this charitable cause is facing suspension due to insufficient donations, which made me worried! I believe that with the high prices and increasing difficulties in life today, the need for assistance to impoverished mothers is even more urgent. Although many wealthy and powerful families have already fled, there are still many substantial merchants who have remained in Shanghai to continue their businesses. Compassion exists in everyone's heart, and I believe that after your esteemed newspaper publishes this urgent appeal, donations will flow in. However, with the daily depreciation of currency, the accumulation of small contributions cannot solve the problem! I would like to offer a humble suggestion to your esteemed newspaper. If your esteemed newspaper can launch a silver dollar donation campaign, this meaningful charitable cause can continue to unfold and will not be interrupted. A silver dollar is currently priced at 4 million yuan. Although ordinary people may not have the surplus to donate, there are certainly many substantial merchants in Shanghai who are able to donate hundreds or thousands of silver dollars. Even the generally stable readers of your esteemed newspaper can strive to donate one silver dollar. I believe that there are more than 10,000 such people. Given the high reputation of your esteemed newspaper, a call to action will certainly be heeded by readers who support your esteemed newspaper, who will not be reluctant to donate this one dollar and allow the maternity assistance program to come to an end. I am now making an effort to donate one silver coin to express my sincerity and hope to inspire others to show warm sympathy from all walks of life, respond to the call, and complete the charitable undertaking. I offer my sincere prayers! I respectfully make this announcement and wish you well.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by Chang Le Ju Resident, May 9th</p>
<h3>Beware of Counterfeit Milk Powder Purchased from Street Stalls</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: I have purchased two five-pound cans of Jinshan brand milk powder from the street, and upon opening them, they were both of poor quality, containing wheat flour and various unclean powders. If these inferior milk powders are not carefully identified, they can cause great harm to the health of infants. I am writing to your column specifically to expose this, so that buyers can pay attention and avoid being fooled. I am also providing the results of my research after being deceived, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Most counterfeit products do not have a spoon inside the can.</p>
<p>(2) The red Golden State oval trademark on the can must be in the middle, and the top and bottom points of the trademark must be about one inch from the lid and bottom. Now, because the milk powder has been taken out and the teeth removed, the distance at the top is less than one inch. This must be because it was opened and then re-covered.</p>
<p>(3) When purchasing, it is best to open the entire lid on the spot to distinguish the genuine from the fake. Even if only a small opening of one inch is allowed, it is not to be trusted, because the milk powder may be genuine on the top and bottom, but the powder in the middle may be adulterated.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the managers and experts will pay attention and send personnel to investigate everywhere, so that they can report to the police and thoroughly investigate these unscrupulous merchants who use all means!</p>
<p>Sincerely, Wang Zhai, a victim of fraud, May 9th</p>
<h3>Ms. Jiang Seeks Employment</h3>
<p>To the esteemed gentlemen: I deeply admire your column for seeking the welfare of the people. I graduated from the Obstetrics Department of Keio University's Medical School in Tokyo. After returning to China, I served as the director of obstetrics at the Ministry of Transportation's Hospital in Ping. I then practiced independently in Tianjin. I recently came to Shanghai and wish to find a position in the medical field. As I have been unemployed for a long time, I feel very bored. I respectfully request your column to help me find a position, whether it is in a municipal hospital, military hospital, or charitable hospital, it is all the same to me, and I do not care about the salary. If you could help me, I would be eternally grateful! I offer my best wishes. Jiang Zhiyi. Contact: c/o Mr. Liu Zhaoxiang, No. 1195 Fuxing Middle Road, Shanghai</p>
