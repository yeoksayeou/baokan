<h3>北平和談獲有進展　促進會代表昨年後出城　市參會向共方抗議轟城</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十八日下午三時三刻電〕有資格人士十七日晚對記者稱：北平對和平之努力，聞已獲決定性發展。該人士並暗示稱：由此一發展，北平和平之來臨將較前所估計爲早。另據本市某大報今日透露：目前雙方所折衝者，僅爲和平程序問題，卽究係「停戰·和平·放下武器」或「放下武器·和平·停戰」。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日下午三時三刻電〕華北人民和平促進會代表十八日上午再度舉行會議，完成一切準備後，午後一時許已出西直門，向現在共軍控制下之香山進發。該團由立委兼中國大學代校長呂復及康同璧女士（康有爲之女）率領，全團十一人。聞出發時，臨時又增加兩人，汽車上懸白布旗，上書「華北人民和平促進會」。聞該團今夜可能在香山留宿一宵。平記者羣本擬隨該團前往採訪，午後因該團臨時提前出發，未能伺行。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十八日電〕卡車一輛，滿載此間民間領袖，十八日駛出西直門赴共軍區會晤共方之葉劍英將軍，呼籲停戰。該代表團在傅作義將軍之贊助下前往共軍區者，何思源雖則於十七日晨受傷仍堅持偕行。據悉：代表團僅有要求停戰之權力，俾停戰期間內由此間國共領袖能討論北平和平之條件。此間中立觀察家對佔優勢之共軍與被圍之國軍間談判中任何步驟，能爲共軍接受一點表示懷疑。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十七日電〕（遲到）據未證實訊：南京政府已保證傳作義將軍可有全權決定使北平成爲戰塲或投降。因此北平局部和平解決之希望又見抬頭。同時，華北和平促進會十八日向毛澤東呼籲稱：「君願意將腥風血雨，一大批孤兒寡婦來建造新北平，抑以繁榮，民主與自由來建造新北平？」此項籲文或許能减輕共軍對北平之條件。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十八日電〕北平市參議會以城內落下砲彈一百餘枚，傷人毁物，今日向共軍提出抗議，要求停止砲轟，北平被圍迄今已入第六星期，此次圍城有一創見之事，爲流動軍法審判，法官·衛兵及創子手乘卡車巡行，就地審判違反戒嚴犯，創子手有携帶大刀者，但迄今祗有五人執行槍決，並未斬首。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十七日電〕今晨有砲彈一枚落在距教廷代表馬丁納公館一百五十呎處，當卽爆炸。據馬氏稱，住宅遭受震動，但未傷人。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十八日電〕平郊兩日來戰况沉寂，未有接觸。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十八日電〕此間今日接天津報告稱，法·義·比·希臘及瑞士等領事館已分別向南京使館報告，謂當共軍砲轟天津時，各該國僑民均未受傷，目前局勢亦甚平靜。</p>
<h3>吳兼外長晤各國使節　盼與政府同進退　財部疏散職工引起粉擾</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕政府積極疏散聲中，吳兼外長日來與各國駐華使節分別接觸，告知政府未來計劃，並盼必要時能與政府同進退，聞各使節對此多表示倘無各該國政府特殊指示，自將隨政府撤往安全地區。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕各部會疏散裁員已漸引起若干不安與紛擾，財部被疏散之職員及工友數百人，十八日下午曾向該部當局有所要求，希望：（一）疏散費除政府規定之薪津三個月及旅費三千元外，最好能再增加。（二）疏散費應卽日發下，要求時爲求發生決定性之力量起見，該部所有職員及工友均不許外出，該部之前後門及邊門亦均被落鎖，斷絕行人，下午五時許渠等齊集部長辦公室大樓，要求立時答復，因部長徐堪赴滬公幹，尚未歸來，由次長楊道機答復，說明政府如此處置已盡最大努力，惟羣衆情緒激昂，仍僵持不散，迄晚七時一刻，楊次長懇切說明增加疏散費非財部所能決定，但疏散費決可於十九日中午開始發給，羣衆始相率離去。</p>

<h3>白吉爾氏聲明青美軍未撤退</h3>
<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕美海軍中將白吉爾十八日稱：華文報紙所載稱：靑島美海軍陸戰隊業已撤退一節，「乃毫無根據」，靑島美海軍陸戰隊並未撤退。白氏並重申其以前之保證稱：嗣後任何諸如此類之行動，當經官方宣布。</p>
<h3>不顧危險的賭博</h3>
<p>周以德攻擊美對華政策</p>
<p>〔合衆社曄盛頓十八日電〕共一和黨衆議員周以德十八日稱：美國集中在歐洲阻遏共產主義，而同時「將中國放棄與共黨」的政策，不啻爲一種「不顧危險的賭博。」在國會紀錄中，周以德稱：相反地，共產主義在亞洲贏得的戰略及心理上的巨大勝利，將使吾人在歐洲阻遏及擊敗共產主義的努力，更形龐大及困難。</p>

<p>（二）延安毛澤東先生惠鑒，數年來全國人民遭受戰禍，壯者散之四方，老弱轉乎溝壑，倒懸之苦，不堪言狀，國家元氣斷喪，民族生存垂危，蔣總統有鑒及此，特於元旦發表文告，提出五項和平原則，全國人民僉以已揭和平之門，歡騰莫名，近閱報載，先生亦於十四日提出八項和平條件，並云「全國人民，業已顯示了目己的意志，人民渴望早日獲得和平」，足徵已有和平之願望，深爲欣幸，惟和平條件相距尚遠，應請本國家獨立民族自由之立場，再加考慮，徵諸以往歷史，恃德者昌，恃力者亡，尤盼以民命爲重，請卽停止軍事行動，雙方派員協商和平具體辦法，俾得化干戈爲玉帛，登斯民於袵席，同人等受人民付託之重，不能不言，亦不忍不言，極願和平立卽實現，保全國家元氣，爭取國際地位，努力建設新中國，實爲幸甚。</p>
<h3>民治民主兩黨籲請國共停戰</h3>

<h3>為廣大苦難學生請命！</h3>
<p>寒假到了！短短的假期轉瞬屆滿，三十八年春季始業的第一學期就要開學，在百物飛漲生活艱難的今日，下學期的學費問題，對於中下家庭，實在是一個嚴重的威脅。大多數的大中學生心頭，也無不橫着這個嚴重問題，爲着下學期的學費而發愁，爲着行將失業而起恐慌。照理說，讀書是下一代靑年應享受的權利，我國憲法也有明文規定。但在萬方多難的今日，除了基本教育而外，我們若還希望政府完全負起教育下一代靑年的責任，勢有所不可能；因此搶救失學靑年，不得不有待於社會各界的努力。本報有鑒於斯，因決定續辦讀者助學金，即日起爲廣大的苦難學生，向社會各界人士呼籲，慷慨助學，希望於一個月內能募集助學金一百萬元，搶救五六百個失學靑年。</p>
<p>本報辦理讀者助學金運動，遠在抗戰期間，已先後辦了八九屆之多，每屆搶救失學靑年，少者數百人，多至千餘人，搶救了苦難學生不少，迨抗戰勝利之後，本報同人認爲此種社會救濟事業有再度舉辦之必要，自三十六年秋季以還，今已第四次·幸賴社會各界熱心人士，一本「助學最樂」之旨，慷慨解囊，集成鉅款，先後搶救失學靑年不下萬人，使其絃歌不輟，畢其所學。我們回顧過去辦理助學的情形，實不能不感謝讀者的慷慨，始有如此美滿的成就。但，同時我們對於上屆辦理助學金的情形，一則因規定的手續太繁，手續太慢，有失助學本義，另則又因通貨惡性膨脹，使慕得的助學金之幣值跌落過大，獲助者竟未能多得實惠。此種情形，我們不能不認爲美中不足。今後辦理助學金，決不能冉有此種現象。因此本報第一次助學會議，即商定改變辦法：</p>
<p>第一，本市各私立大中學校對於下學期學費，均已決定徵收學米，本報助學金自亦應以食米爲標準。故決定初中每名資助中白粳米一石，高中每名一石二斗，大專每名一石五斗。在此時局動盪不定之際，金圓券的膨脹勢所難免，爲保存幣値計，故將捐款一律以實物計算。換言之，即每日將募捐所得之助學金，立即照市購買食米儲存米行；將來支付助學金，亦以食米付给。如此，不特幣値可以保存，而且獲助者也可得到實惠。上屆的缺點，也就不會再度發生了。</p>
<p>第二，本報辦理助學金，雖出諸自動，但在過去三屆，均與上海市獎學金統一審核委員會合作辦理。惜該會一審再審，需時旣久，再加以各校編製免費生名册往往遷延時日，以致到發放助學金時，幣値跌落過鉅，使獲助者不能多得實惠，捐助鉅款者亦因其不能達到搶救失學靑年的目的，更爲失望。此種情形，如若不加改變，則今後募捐助學金，勢必受其影響。所以本報助學金，自本屆起，決計恢復主動地位，單獨辦理。一至開學，即自動審查各大中學生申請人的資格及學業，決定後，更當儘速發給助學金，並將此一批名單抄送統審會杳考，以免重複。如此，本報雖單獨辦理，也不致妨碍統容會的工作。</p>
<p>要之，助學金運動實爲當前最富於意義的社會救濟事業，我們一方面要求辦理手續力求完善，另一方面更希望社會各界人士均能伸出慈悲的手，慷慨解囊，捐助鉅款，購儲學米，搶救無數的苦難學生，以免流離失學。今日多搶救一個失學靑年，也就替下一代多保留一分元氣。所以，我們要再度爲廣大的苦難學生向社會各界請命！</p>
<h3>中國如成兩陣營　聯合遭遇難題　恐將動搖聯合國之基礎</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十八日電〕中國之分裂爲國共兩大陣營，已成爲聯合國最大之問題。甚多聯合國外交家，刻正努力研究此問題。若中共宣布成立政府，而國民政府仍自稱爲中國唯一合法政權，則應如何措置。某聯合國官員構：卽使數理大家愛因斯坦，恐亦將瞠目不知所對。舊金山會議中，在美國之堅持下，各國公認中國爲五强之一，雄據安理會常務理事席，且享有否決特權。中國且爲托管理事會常務理事，挿足經濟社會理事會，此外尚列席十餘二流聯合國組織。若中共奄有全國，國民政府舉全國投降，則解決方法簡而易舉，然非西方國家之福。共產中國屆時將昂然步入安理會，以否決權協助蘇聯，使運用過多之蘇聯否決權能稍有休息。中共亦將接收現政府在聯合國之一切職務。然聯合國之困境，厥爲一旦國民政府遷都台灣，以半流亡方式作戰到底，則聯合國將面臨何政府代表中國之課題。若千官負認此事將動搖聯合國之基礎。西方國家旣在聯合國大會及各組織中擁有壓倒之多數，故中共卽擬有所作爲，亦不難打倒。然認爲解決辦法如此簡單者亦僅數人而已。若美蘇間無裂痕，則擁有四百四十萬哩之中共政府及無權之國民政府，兩者間選擇不待著龜可明。然若此事在目前形勢下發生，而聯合國必須加以考慮，則屬另一問題，西方若再欲國民政府維持其席次，恐已甚難向世界各國解釋。</p>

<p>〔聯合社新德里十七日電〕印尼共和國人士今日稱，印度總理尼赤魯發起之亞洲各國會議於二十日在此開幕後，印尼代表團卽將正式提議對荷闌實行經濟裁。印尼共和國已向該提出備忘錄，規定荷軍撤退，組織臨時政府及設立印尼聯邦之時間表，聯合國機構如果無法制止荷方之繼續侵略，參加亞洲會議各國必須禁止荷闌飛機船隻自其境內載運軍火或軍隊，一面並以物資及金錢援助印尼。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里十八日電〕亞洲各國參加東南亞會議與代表，現已陸續抵達新德里。現各國代表，已在新德里作非正式之接觸。據聞各代表間之私人會商，將於海德拉巴德土王在新德里之宮殿內舉行，而揭幕典禮及正式會議，則將於印度國會大厦舉行之。據此問觀察家稱，各國代表關於印尼問題，有數點在原則已獲協議。同一方面又認爲，目前有兩事使大會人士担憂者：（一）卽共黨在中國之勝利；（二）各國深懼新印度帝國主義之代替西方帝國主義是也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里十八日電〕菲參加東南亞會議代表羅慕洛，十七日向新聞界宣稱，召開此次會議係一大胆之政治作風，因此係東南亞方面達成和平之右效辦法。又稱，此次會議將造成有歷史重要之偉績，因此尚爲此類會議之首次舉行。羅慕洛繼稱，西方列强誤解此次會議，渠等深恐此卽亞洲集團出現之謂，卽使如此，亦無何錯誤之處可指摘。世界各誡已成立甚多集團，如西方聯盟，汛美集團，大西洋公約等皆是也。</p>
<h3>印尼問題結束一般辯論　四國今提新議案　印促安理會廿日前採取行動</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖十七日電〕據消息靈通人士稱：安理會十九日復會後，中國將與美國·挪威·古巴共同爲印尼問題提出議案，聞四國對提案內容之意見，無基本不同之處。提案除稍有修正外，大體與美國上週五所秘密通知各國之草案相同。安理會對印尼問題，今已完成一般辯論，唯未採取行動</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十八日電〕據悉：安理會美國代表團，正起草一項建議，由聯合國監督荷阑在印尼的統治權的逐漸撤退。安理會代表均急待在十九日決定行動，俾能阻止二十日在新德里召開的亞洲國家會議鑒於安理會之缺乏行動而自動處決事件的可能性。印度以新德里會議主催人的身份，曾再三保證任何行動必將歸納於聯合國組織之內，但印度大使雷俄要安理會加速行動，俾新德里會議能在「不同的氣氛下」開始。美國代表傑塞普同意雷俄之觀點，「安理會理事國間對印尼問題原有極大部份的協議，如此種協議的可能因對任何細則的不協議而冲淡，則仍屬不幸。」傑塞晋並同意印尼代表畢拉之觀點稱：「如吾人採取一項不完備的決議，則仍屬不幸」。按照議事規程，美國需要獲得安理會中七國的支持，始能通過任何決議，因此，美國可能不得不對其立塲，作若干些微修正，俾能獲得通過的保證。一般認爲，美國之建議當包括傑塞普所建議之「程序表」，加以雷俄在十七日舉出的要點的大部。據悉，英國將贊成此項建議，蘇聯則認爲最大之危機在於法國，如決議案措辭過强，則法國可能運用否決權。以前，法國卽在印尼事件中運用否決權一次。</p>

<p>昨日茶市：仍以普通貨，尚有零星交易，至於品質高尚者，自貨稀供缺後，過程久居岑靜，而查趨勢，雖在銀根頻緊中，但因貨方心思安定，咸萌愛不釋手，是以依然巍站。價格方面，亦頗挺僧。茲據業中人云：目前本街店號對於各項花色，均有加緊添納之勢，綠因農歷歲暮在邇，以應門市實需云。</p>
<h3>銀根緊勢空前　市拆再創新高峯</h3>
<p>市間銀根昨日承前日午後猛緊之後，續呈緊局。晨間各缺單行莊，因隔夜頭寸未妥，紛向業外搜拆現鈔，以資繳解中央銀行抵單。午前緊勢驟甚，週轉困窒不堪，暗拆由日拆八十元，一度再升至一百元以外，行市按需要情形而定，近於混亂。</p>
<p>現鈔籌碼昨市尤緊，因業內行莊多已以之繳解央行抵單，昨日午前客戶提支，多不能付出，市間資金以時局關係，顯有南逃跡象，大票貼水，做百分之六上下</p>
<p>又訊：各項商品價格，除食米外，一律下降。各業市塲贈息做價，高低不一，橡膠市塲一度曾達百元左右，絲綢棉紗等市，亦高站八九十元間。僅食米市塲，做價獨低，爲六十元至七十元。</p>
<p>自金銀存兌辦法廢除後，市塲中盛傳中央銀行暗中在市大量拋售黄金，以協助抽緊銀根，國行負責方面，對上訊均稱不知，旣不承認，但亦未否認云。</p>
<h3>絲綢跌風頗劇</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况一蹶不振，市上銀根奇緊，千元日拆高至一百元散多不勝重荷，了結頻繁，收市一致軋小。</p>
<p>一二〇號天橋早晨以六六〇〇〇元低盤開做，開後聞金價盤升，人心轉平，塲上納胃微起，市况轉見活動，喊價微升五〇〇元至千元。嗣後銀根突緊，外匯證續挫，金融黑市又見同小，買氣又散，直至午收，各帮認爲小無可小，吸意再起，頽勢始行站住，終以六六五〇〇元收盤，跌落萬元左右。</p>
<p>生絲以外匯移轉證一再盤挫，業外各物每况愈下，人心軟弱，做價無法喊高，塲上納胃尤稀，交易淸淡，優級另担低盤做開七六〇〇〇元，成交未見暢旺，市况軟弱。</p>
<p>綢經昨日市勢亦告勁瀉，塲內買氣閒散，了售不絕，散戶脫手尤多，優面無力拉抬，市况初開卽低，美亞晨以四三五〇〇元喊做，中間微盤微軟，最後圈外物價一致報小，金融黑市先疲後高，中又轉軟，人心一片拋空心，小後再見挫落，午收四二八〇〇元結束，軋跌一〇〇〇元左右。</p>
<h3>紡建繼續拋售　棉紗趨勢下挫　布疋客銷不振賣氣彌漫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨續代國行美援會等拋紗，紗市受銀根緊　影響，去路轉狹，請購者僅卅九戶，共購二一五件，全數照配，收回價款一〇，二五一，○○○元。</p>
<p>昨日分五次掛牌售紗，結果售去廿支雙地球八二件，每件三萬九千元。四二支雙股藍鳳七三件，每件六萬四千元。廿支金雙馬十九件，每件三萬八千元。四〇支紅竇光三件，每件五萬九千元。廿支天女卅八件，每件三萬九千元。</p>
<p>又該公司昨循例售布，共售布九三七〇疋，一〇五〇〇磅，請購單四四〇張，收回價款一六，五〇五，四〇〇元。</p>
<p>棉紗市勢軟弱，圈外物品大多趨跌，外埠去化更趨狹小，加以銀根空前緊倘，貨主亦因拆息高昂，紛圖求售，中途賣出空氣不絕如縷，納戶則看小不進，故塲內交易寥寥。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳初以六九〇〇〇元開出，一度喊低至六五〇〇〇元，收市爲六八〇〇〇元，較前挫七〇〇〇元。四〇支藍鳳軋降甚鉅，計一二〇〇〇元，三二支銀月終跌九五〇〇元，以五三〇〇元結束。</p>
<p>壓下一支雙馬現貨自四七〇〇〇元喊至四五〇〇〇元爲最低，午收回升至五〇〇〇〇元關，軋小四〇〇〇元，廠單曾迫入四〇〇〇〇元關內，最後爲四一五〇〇元，終挫五五〇〇元。套利一天期初做四〇〇〇元，午刻二五〇〇元亦有人套出，餘紗成交冷落，市隨之軟化。</p>
<p>布市客銷不振，市上銀根更見緊歛，日拆須一元左右，致執戶受高利壓迫，售意堅强，塲中賣氣頓見濃郁，但以染指者甚稀，結果各市一致慘跌。</p>
<p>龍頭細布塲外初喊一九五〇元。最後大約在一八〇〇元左右，五福細布自一九〇〇元步退至一八四〇元結束，終降四三三〇元，喇叭童細布軋跌四八〇元，以一六二〇元收市，其餘各橋如Ｂ龍頭與大雙龍等，均小三〇〇元至四〇〇元。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰，初以一七七〇元開出，最高達一八〇〇元，收前曾小至一六五〇元，收市爲一六六〇元，較前挫八〇元，四君子元直貢瀉五〇〇元，其他各市亦跟蹤下游。</p>
<h3>政府大量拋售物資穩定物價具有把握</h3>
<p>財政工商糧食主計各部首長，在滬邀集有關當局，召開物價會議後，對今後穩定物價方策，已有具體決定。</p>
<p>據參加會議之工商部長劉維熾氏昨對記者表示：政府對穩定物價，決自拋售物資，緊縮銀根兩途着手。目前政府所掌握之米·煤·紗·外匯證·等，爲數甚豐，對控制物價，具有把握。各有關機構，今後除密切配合，視需要情形，作大量拋售外，對金融商品市塲之管制，亦將嚴密注意。至公用事業價格，今後亦將力予穩定，以免發生刺激作用·關於開放證劵市塲，技術問題現正研究中，主要之點，在使證劵交易如何發揮吸收游資，輔助工商業發展之作用，而消滅掀風作浪之投機性。爲此目的，證劵交易之保證金，有提高至百分之七十五至百分之百之必要。一俟技術問題商妥，復業卽可實現。劉氏定十八日乘夜車返京。</p>

<h3>南市足球友誼賽　東星一球勝華光　天寒風緊觀衆千五百餘人</h3>
<p>華光與東星兩足球隊，昨借體育塲舉行友誼賽，天寒風緊，觀者一千五百餘人，華光首開紀錄，然後東星還敬兩球，成爲上半時之比數，亦卽最後之結果。華光防衛堅固，鋒綫較弱，東星人材平均，脚頭硬壯，論球藝東星稍勝一籌，攻勢亦盛，故能以二比一取勝。雙方守門演出俱佳，華光以吳祺祥爲最出色，不但救出險球不少，而且造成不少攻勢，東星五鋒活躍，竄頭勢頗足，衛綫亦都有路道，尤其李承先與鄭秉彝甚見稱職。</p>
<p>上半時華光居逆風，東星自始採攻勢，八分鐘，華光衝出重衛，球從右路輸送前方，經錢允慶擺渡，瞿永福軋出擋子，竄前一脚，首開紀錄，其後東星得風勢之助，仍向華光壓迫，樂德權呂起堂左右招架，吳祺祥居中攔截，陳惠民雖然生意興隆，幸無失漏，十九分鐘，東星史大法在離門三十碼處開任意球，吳凱敏順勢衝上，一觸而入，扳成一比一平手。相隔三分鐘，左翼姜現開角球，落點恰到好處，張吉良截獲，傳交閻承寬，閻以淸脆之脚頭，力射入網，反以二比一反敗爲勝。</p>
<p>易位後，華光佔得順風地位，局勢頓現平均，踢來亦更緊張，彼此俱有攻門機會，產生驚險鏡頭。最後十分鐘，華光頻頻攻門，但以操之過急，門將高維辰身手不凡，未有收獲，結果仍爲二比一，東星獲勝。二隊出塲陣容如下：　東星</p>

<h3>放眼看華中</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　房滄浪</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十五日航訊〕從三十七年十二月二十日到除夕，華中各地的氣候，是陰曇而多寒，因此人們的心情也顯得更覺沉重，更加憂鬱。其實，這裏的氣候並不十分冷，生活環境也很正常而不特殊，一般腦淸眼明底人們所認爲特殊的，只不過下述幾件事：</p>
<p>人心望和全面交響</p>
<p>「兵猶火也，不戢自焚」，這是我們老祖宗留下來的一句寳訓。現在國內戰事打了三年，打得一億萬以上的人民家破人亡，戰局依然難解難分，人心望和，人人旣然希望有一個和而且平的局面出現，和平的呼聲經傳播當然就交響起來，身負華中安危的白總司令微聞總統對於，一這時和戰大計，將有一新的決定，於是衡量全局，俯順民情在十二月下旬，向中央提供若干寳貴的意見，事後據有關方面透露：白氏的建議與總統的願望實不謀而合，所以當總統元且文吿發表之後，華中各地的與情一致翕服，了無間言，此可於湘鄂等民意機關所發出之籲和文電中，覘其大概，就中主張比較偏激，反應較爲別致的，僅有河南省參議會議長劉積學，以個人名義所發之世電，以及湖北的一二憂時憤俗的老人在籲和座談會上講的幾句牢騷話，當時似乎聳人聽聞，而且經過謠言販子傳播之後，敏感的人就像煞有介事的議論起來，並且有很多沉不住氣的人們，對於上述的二三元老大加批評，其實這都是多餘，須知世界上受不慣戰火煎熬的人類，是無間老少，何况這幾位飽經憂患的老人？他們有他個人說話的自由，他們對於總統的革命功勲和領導抗戰的業績，都很推崇，而且深信從善如流的蔣總統可能接受睜言，果然不久，總統覆電來到，對於老人意見，表示富納，最近又乘政委張　應　來漢之便，將政府謀和的苦心，及當前局勢眞相，代達一番，道才使華中各省的和平運動，由人同此心而心同此理。</p>
<p>菩薩未來且慢燒香</p>
<p>華中的和平空氣，旣吿澄淸，漢口的謠言也同見减少，人們的話題又撥轉到「和」「戰」「退」這三個問號上去了。可見一般人心的苦悶，不過從若千由南京來的人們口中，還以聽到不少令人差可安慰的好消息。所可憾的是：京滬報紙已經闊別二十餘日了，這一種停運京滬新聞紙的荒唐決定，給予造謠者以更好機會，母怪此間民意代表見到記者，就太息地說：「這年頭兒，打聽行情也不容易，京滬報紙不來，行市當然看不淸楚，漢口統一街的銀元販子，當然要亂報行情，掀風作浪，少數不懂仃情的人，免不了要做些「菩薩未來，先忙燒香」的勾當，搶着買銀元。爲什麼交通當局不許我們看南京報和上海報」？</p>
<p>談到漢口，說到銀元，偉可使公敎人員們猛打一個寒　。漢口銀元價値與物價扣得是緊貼而周到，這現象由來已久，最初因爲廠商到產地收花，屠商到鄕下買猪，糧商到產區購米，都須以現洋作交易，銀元在商塲上就起了領導作用。降至今日，金圓未亡，人心先死，銀元在漢口乃至華中各埠商塲的威力，已無與倫比，一切物價都要跟着牠走。在最近的一個多月中，漢口銀元黑市，已由每塊廿元漲到一百三十元，而且銀高一尺，物高一丈。銀元黑市每每將物價白市攪得一團糟，物價給銀元捧上去，就掉不下。近三日，漢口銀根步緊，銀元已回跌至一百一十元左右，而物價不跌。最可憐的是百物俱漲，公敎乃最廉，與銀元脫節的公敎人員生活，在武漢三鎭及豫南，每個人對於銀元都恨得入骨，尤其在漢口，萬惡「銀」爲首。在這短短十天中，因爲市致當局的努力，已經關禁起幾百條銀狗了，雖然銀元還在作怪，這可不能單獨譴責現任行政官史的低能或不負責，只好大駡「銀元該死」，大單那些過去喜歡銀地的「惡棍該殺」，「該殺」，出口怨氣罷了。</p>
<h3>戰區學生在江西</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌十五日航訊〕戰區靑年學生與一部份敎職員，不願在共產黨的控制區域，接受含有毒素的敎育，自願離鄉別井，走上逃難的窮困之途，他們這種艱苦卓絕的精神，引起了社會人士的敬佩，博得後方人民同情，所以，他們在南遷途中，不斷接受地方人士的招待，江西對於過境流亡學生的招待與安置，更使他們在艱苦的旅途中，獲得人類同情的溫暖，更堅定他們戡建必成的信心，</p>
<p>不速之客</p>
<p>第一批戰區流亡學生，由京滬抵達浙贛路南昌車站時，因爲事先敎育部旣未派人來贛主持招待，更沒有一個電報，通知敎育廳，直到學生們到達南站，敎育廳，才接到車站的報吿，說是有一批戰區學生來到，還沒有吃飯，更沒有多餘的錢在車站開旅社，解決當天的食宿問題，周邦道廳長，素有「老夫子」之尊稱，他接到這個報吿，眞苦了他當時的「窮應付」，因爲敎育廳是個窮到連辦公廳火亦煽不起的機關，那裏還有多餘的錢，在緊急的剎那間，來應付這件事？</p>
<p>當時從廳裏各個職員的腰包裏把各人僅有的小菜錢，香烟錢，凑成一個小得可憐數字，趕快派人跑去車站，招待這批「不速之客」。</p>
<p>但是，第一批學生，招待過去了，第二批，三批，不斷地由東而來，那末，敎育廳却沒辦法，乃由周廳長出面，向中央合作金庫，中國農民銀行，…………幾家平日對社會事業，頗感趣味的金融機關，臨時吿貸一筆款子，用作招待費，答應荷負銀行的利息，限五天籌還。</p>
<p>招待工作</p>
<p>招待工作就是得到這筆貸款後，乃普一過展開，正式在車站設招待所，預備茶永飯點，而且有許多在中途患病的學生，還由衛生處派專人在站設所治療，省府胡家鳳主席與周邦道廳長，社會名流等不時到站上去慰問。</p>
<p>流亡綫上的學生們，得到這樣的慰問與招待，深深的感覺「人間亦有同情心」，那些時車站上雖然亦有偶而因買賣食物而發生誤會，但是，地方秩序，總算是很安謐。</p>
<p>現在據敎育廳的消息，用於招待流亡學生的招待費，共計二萬三千元。</p>
<p>籌款辦法</p>
<p>這筆款的來源，原先擬定二個辦法，（一）由各校發動募捐運動，（二）由省參議長王枕心，敎育廳廳長周邦道，具函向各大富戶勸募，當時他們認爲第二個辦法的籌款，應該有好的結果，就是這二位具名的王周二公，上門吿貸，有錢的人們亦會看面子，但是，事實却完全相反。</p>
<p>學生們在街上勸募捐款時，遇過慷慨之士，却亦遭過人家的白眼，他們憑自己的熱忱，居然獲得很好的成績，－募得四萬二千餘元，另外的一些袞袞諸公接到王議長，周廳長的勸募信，除了一位商人，自動將一千元，送到敎育廳去之外，再亦沒有第二人與其媲美。</p>
<h3>蘇省地政重點推進農地改革</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江十七日訊〕蘇省今年度地政工作重點，除繼續舉辦地籍整理外，將推動農地改革。據省地政局長張暉談：「現在正搜集有關資料，擬訂簡而易行之辦法，提請省府會議通過後卽施行。至辦法內容，將分別酌量陷區，半控制區與控制區的實際情形，規定進度，實行耕者有其田，以安定農民生活，增强作戰力量，但實行時非有革命手段不足解決困難。本省嘉定·吳江·常熟。江寗等四縣，已劃爲士改實騐縣，將以該四縣推進的情形，以供全省改革的參考」。</p>
<h3>滇黔川邊境治安近貌　（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽九日航訊〕龍騰霄機彈充分而精良，並十分有效，民衛隊當然不是敵手，省方星夜趕調駐筑省保安第二團一個哮，並且與旗東國軍一二六師一個營增援協剿，激戰約十天左右，官匪互有傷亡。普安縣長熊强，且會一度被俘，保安團方面兩個營長受傷。看情况，還要增加兵力，終能操勝　，因爲匪衆已由地千左右裏脅到五六千人了。黔省保安副司令韓文煥親自出馬，並增調獨立營一營到盤縣，興義的專員盧傑，也率領興義，興仁等縣民衛隊及區保安隊去加入戰綫，如此費盡力氣，才於十一月二十七日把龍騰霄的老巢糯寨攻克。他統帶着殘部潰匿到盤縣與平彝交界地方的海子去繼續頑抗，目前該地一帶的種烟莠民懾於政府兵力，均已自動鏟除炳苗，治安秩序也已逐漸恢復。可是龍議霄是不是有一天會捲土重來，仍應加以注意。谷正倫主席主張「邊地重於腹地，防匪重於剿匪」的，所以目前盤縣普安一帶的剿匪部隊仍未復員，俾免匪衆死灰復燃。普安縣長熊强，且以「措置失當」被撤職查辦。</p>
<p>在黔西的畢節，滇東的鎭雄，川南的叙永等縣交界地處，林深　密，山嶺縱橫，自遜消中葉以迄今茲，可以說從來就是三省邊界的惡勢力在那裏統冶着，其中尤以</p>
<p>畢節土司</p>
<p>楊砥中，鎭雄土豪隴承堯的勢力最大，政府當局對他們向來是採綏靖政策，只要他們在表面上能够瞧得起政府人員，總是抱「大事化小，小事化無」的態度。而該地區的人民，從來就怕開罪了這股土司或者豪紳地主之流。本年十一月下有，滇省府奉到重慶綏署的命令，談隴承堯組織他的「隴家班」，一面迫攝縣參會議長徐世芳，士紳李仁甫，一面利誘縣長羅人吉對於禁令陽奉陰違，在縣境內大量栽種烟土，並且聚集土匪流氓武裝保護栽種，滇省恐怕該地區莠民容易給共匪混入利用，遂派省保安副司令柏天民偕同滇東駐軍一二六師前往淸鄕，並將縣長羅人吉，議長徐世芳士紳李仁甫等</p>
<p>設計捕殺</p>
<p>但匪隴隴承堯等仍挾特殊力量得以安然兎脫。重慶綏署曾於十一月底密令滇黔川三省當局一體協緝隴承堯等歸案究辦，惟因隴曾任過滇東指揮所指揮官，他與雲南的前後主政人物都有特殊姻緣，黔省方面也想設法覊糜他，不必「逼他上梁山」，因此滇黔兩省都會於去年十二月初或電請渝綏署撤銷隴承堯通緝令，或負責推薦，要他爲保衛桑梓而將功贖罪。最近畢節，鎭雄，敍永一帶的治安秩序是否可獲暫時安定，當然沒有。並且平彝，曲靖，霑盛，盤縣，普安等隣近縣份的電話綫，就常被那批匪徒在打家劫舍時破壞，而公路汽車交通，也常在邊境出入孔道被匪洗刧，無法剿獲。邊境治安不易維持，癥結是在「以隣爲壑」，何况又是剿辦半民半匪的勢力？</p>
<p>川南筠連，琪縣，敍永等縣與滇黔兩省緊隣，犬牙分錯地方，常有股匪出沒，因爲濾縣，宜賓是滇黔</p>
<p>烟土走私</p>
<p>棧的出口，販運烟土必須要參加袍哥帮會的組織才比較容易「吃得開」。這班人與匪徒又無法分淸的，毋寗說他們是「三位一體」，想澈底淸除他們眞不容易。最近蓉渝報紙迭載川南僻靜縣份破獲大規模組織的一貫敎匪，爲首的是河北人常振中高賀光等，他們由北平入川，在全川各地廣設敎壇，招致靑年男女及無業流民人敎，並繳納鉅額會費，一時無知男女趨之如驚。該敎已在川南各縣設有分會，且續有北平專人前來，足見其組織廳大。重慶綏署已令飭滇黔三省毗隣邊境切實查拏，黔省當局並已與川省當局議定，在兩省接壞縣份雙方敷設電話網，以期情報靈通，並進而協議聯防會剿流竄散匪，目前如道眞，沿河，南川，黔江，畢節，敍永等縣間，已切去聯絡，據報尙無或股匪徒嘯聚爲害，農村治安秩序尙稱安謐。</p>
<p>滇·黔·川三角地帶的士共，如劉復初，鄒正中，何芷平等，煽惑鄕農稱兵作亂，已歷十餘年，雖然何正平已在昆明伏法，但劉復初，鄒正中還舟在這一帶地方潛伏構煽，亟盼一省治安當局「居安思危」，早爲留意。</p>

<h3>英國國有企業的管理　（上）</h3>
<p>— 本耿</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦四日航訊〕從一九四五年工黨執政以來，重要企業之國有者，除鋼鐵工業一項尙在國會立法程序中者外，已有英格蘭銀行，民用航空，煤，電，煤氣，生棉（集中購買），運輸，等項。此外，英國廣播公司（British　Broodeasting　Corporatation）於一九二七年正月起，卽已改爲公共管理性質，但一九四七年正月開始生效之第三次許可證，與前此亦略有不同。</p>
<p>本文的目的，在於將英國各種國有企業之管理方法，作一簡單的介紹。以問題爲中心，而後依據各企業的情形，加以說明。</p>
<p>先由核心組織說起</p>
<p>各種企業管理的核心組織，其名稱不同，或稱「公司」（Corporation）例如廣播與民用航空，或稱管理局（Authority或Board）例如電與煤，或稱委員會（Commission，或Conncil，例如生棉，運輸，與煤氣，或稱董事會（Ｃourt）例如英格蘭銀行。不過這些機構的名稱，雖不一致，但是大致都是採委員制，委員的人數不等，由廣播公司之七人（內包括主席與副主席各一），到英格蘭銀行之十八人（內總裁與副總裁各一）。除了廣播公司的委員由樞密院任命英格蘭銀行由英王任命以外，其餘機構的委員，都是由主管部部長任命。現任下議院議員者一律不能担任上述各種國有企業的委負，另外，大約凡本身另有職業而其職業的利益與某國有企業不能調和者，也不能充任該國有企業的委員。至於積極的資格，有的企業並無限定，例如廣播，銀行，及民用航空。其餘大都規定對於各該企業之有關業務有學識或經騐者。至於任期，有的有確定的任期，例如英格蘭銀行的總裁副總裁爲五年，委員爲四年。有的規定不能超過若干年，例如廣播公司不能超過五年。有的規定於任命時規定年限者如運輸。有的規定由政府主管部長加以規定例如煤，電，生棉。至於撤職一點，有的規定可以撤職而不加條件，例如廣播公司可以由樞密院撤職。有的規定主管部長如認爲某人不適合時，可以宣佈該職務出缺，例如煤與電。有的規定在某種情形之下主管部長可以宣布該職務出缺，例如民用航空。有的未加規定，例如運輸。薪給方面，廣播公司之主席年俸三千鎊，副主席一千鎊，委員六百鎊，英格蘭銀行總裁年俸二千鎊，副總裁一千五百鎊，委員五百鎊。其他各企業之委員待遇，由主管部長以財政部之同意規定之。</p>
<p>上面所說的核心組織，也可以說是</p>
<p>各該企業最高組織</p>
<p>除了這個最高組織之外，有的企業還有區械組織或顧問性質之組織，這裏亦擬加以簡單說明。</p>
<p>所謂區域組織者，就是說有的企業事實上是分散在全國各地的，因此自然有「區域組織」（Area　Board）的必要。這種區域組織見之於法律的規定者如電及煤氣等是。電的情形，將全國分爲十四區，每區有一個管理機構，採委員制，由主管部長諮詢電的最高組織後任命之。除主席一人外，人數爲五至七人。煤氣將全國分爲十二區，亦採委員制，人數與電相同，由主管部長就法律所規定的合格人士中任命之。至於區域機構與核心組織的關係，多少帶有上下的性質。換言之，區域組織的活動範圍，不僅只限於特定區域，而在事實上，是要受核心組織的指導監督，並且有某些權力是專屬於核心組織者。另外有一種組織，有些類似區域組織而實際上並不相同者，卽運輸企業之分爲五個「執行部門」（Bxecntives）。運輸企業除核心組織外，其下分爲「鐵路」「船塢與國內航運」「公路運輸」「倫敦交通」及「旅館」等五執行部門。亦係委員制，人數除主席一人外，另有委員四至八人，由主管部長諮詢運輸最高機構後就合格人士中任命之。此種執行機構之權力，由於最高機構以主管部長之同意委託之。</p>
<p>除上述之組織外，另有一種</p>
<p>類似顧問性質機構</p>
<p>例如廣播公司之廣播節目，分爲若干區，因此設有若千「區域願問委員會」（RegionAdvisory　Conncil），必要時尙可設立其他顧間委員會。區域顧問委員會之人選，乃爲可以代表該區人民者。煤設有兩種消費者委員會，一爲「工業用煤消費者委員會」（Industrial　Coal　Consumero　Comncil）一爲「家庭用煤消費者委員會」（Domestic　CoalCons　mers　Conncil），都是分區設立·由主管部長與利益有關之團體商洽後任命之。它的任務在於討論有關於煤之供求事項，而後以之作爲主管機關的參考。民用航空設有「空運顧問委員會」（Air　Transport　Advisory　Conucil），除主席一人必須具有律師資格者外，另有委員二至四人，其中至少一人有空運經騐，一人有其他運輸經騐。現在英國有三個民用航空的公司，每一公司均須有此種委員會。電則各區均有「諮詢委員會「Cons２ltativs　Conucil），人數二十至三十人，其中二分之一至五分之三必須爲代表地方者，其餘則爲代表各種與電有關之消費者。煤氣之情形與此大致相同。運輸則有兩種機構，一爲諮詢委員會，一爲運輸法庭（Transport　Tribnnal）前者之性質爲顧問諮詢或聯繫性質，後者則爲審議運輸費用性質之機構。其人選　均與消費者有關。</p>
<p>上面所說的乃關於組織方面，以下當進而略言主管部對於各種國有企業之監督方法。關於</p>
<p>國有企業監督方法</p>
<p>除了關於人事方面的任免實際上是一種間接的監督方法以外，其關於對事方面，大約可以分爲幾點：第一，在原則上，主管部長對於各有關的國有企業，大約總是保有頒發命令加以指導的權力。不過法律上對於各種國有企業的規定幷不完全相同。有的規定得具體，例如廣播，郵電部長得通知廣播公司停止廣播某些節目，同時在郵電部長認爲必要時，幷得直接使用廣播電台。有的規定得比較抽象，例如英格蘭銀行，規定財政部在與銀行總裁接洽之後，得發認爲與公共利益有關之指導。也有的規定某些事情必須取得主管部長之許可，例如煤，除了有類似上述英格蘭銀行之規定者外，又規定凡有關資金支出之改組或發展者，必須隨時取得部長之許可。第二，關於財政方面者，通常舉債受有限制，例如廣播公司只能舉一百萬鎊之債，煤可以舉一千萬鎊之債，但除依據本身所得之權力行事外。必須有部長之許可。民用航空一共有三家公司，每家所能舉之數目不同，但亦須財政部之許可。其他如電，煤氣，運輸等亦大致均受有限制。同時關於賬目方面，亦常受有某種監督，例如廣播公司每年賬目必須送交郵電部長，幷須經郵電部長所許可之登記會計師審查。煤，民用航空，電，煤氣，生棉，及運輸等項，亦均受主管部許可之會計師審查。第三年度報吿，廣播公司，煤，民用航空，電，煤氣，生棉及運輸等項，均須每年提出年度報吿。而由主管部長轉達國會。</p>
<p>以上所說明者，乃其大概情形。除了廣播公司帶有「時許公司」性質之外，其餘都是</p>
<p>通常所謂國營企業。而廣播公司於九九二七年卽已開始，其餘的則均係於工黨執政之後才歸之國營。一般說來，英國目下國營企業之管理，有幾個特點：第一，這些國營企業的組織，雖微帶有獨立性，而與一般政府之行政機關不同。但是它都不能與一般私人公司比較，這些國營企業的組織，多半受有主管部之相當嚴格的監督與指導。第二，在組織內部方面，大致都是採取委員制，而另設一主席一類之職務。委員人選多半是對該業有若干經騐者，以收集思廣益之效，同時限制下議院議員兼任，以使其不與政治發生太密切之關係。第三，這些企業，多半設有顧問性質之機關，這些機關的目的，大致都不是技術性的而是社會性的，希望使企業機關與企業使用者在道裏得到一個合作的機會，這些辦法，嚴格說來，都是在一種試騐的過程中，成效若何，則有待他日之事實證明。</p>

<h3>Progress Achieved in Peiping Peace Talks; Representatives of the Promotion Association Leave the City After Last Year; City Council Protests Bombardment of the City to the Communist Side</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th Afternoon, 3:15 PM Telegraph] Qualified sources told reporters on the evening of the 17th that significant progress had reportedly been made in the efforts for peace in Peiping. The source also hinted that, as a result of this development, the arrival of peace in Peiping would be earlier than previously estimated. Another major newspaper in the city revealed today that the only issues being negotiated between the two sides are the procedural aspects of peace, namely whether it should be "Ceasefire, Peace, Lay Down Arms" or "Lay Down Arms, Peace, Ceasefire."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th Afternoon, 3:15 PM Telegraph] Representatives of the North China People's Peace Promotion Association held another meeting on the morning of the 18th. After completing all preparations, they departed from Xizhimen around 1:00 PM, heading towards Xiangshan, which is currently under the control of the Communist army. The delegation is led by Lu Fu, a legislator and acting president of China University, and Ms. Kang Tongbi (daughter of Kang Youwei), totaling eleven people. It is reported that two people were added temporarily upon departure. The car displayed a white cloth flag with the words "North China People's Peace Promotion Association." It is believed that the delegation may stay overnight in Xiangshan tonight. The Peiping press corps originally planned to accompany the delegation for interviews, but was unable to do so due to the delegation's advance departure in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 18th Dispatch] A truck, filled with local civilian leaders, drove out of Xizhimen on the 18th to meet with Communist General Ye Jianying in the Communist-controlled area, appealing for a ceasefire. Although He Siyuan was injured on the morning of the 17th, he insisted on joining the delegation, which is traveling to the Communist area with the support of General Fu Zuoyi. It is understood that the delegation only has the power to request a ceasefire, so that leaders of the Nationalists and Communists in this area can discuss the conditions for peace in Peiping during the ceasefire. Neutral observers here are skeptical that any steps in the negotiations between the dominant Communist army and the besieged Nationalist army will be accepted by the Communist army.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 17th Dispatch] (Delayed) According to unconfirmed reports, the Nanjing government has assured General Fu Zuoyi that he has full authority to decide whether to turn Peiping into a battlefield or surrender. As a result, hopes for a local peaceful resolution in Peiping have resurfaced. Meanwhile, the North China Peace Promotion Association appealed to Mao Zedong on the 18th, asking: "Are you willing to build a new Peiping with bloodshed, a large number of orphans and widows, or to build a new Peiping with prosperity, democracy, and freedom?" This appeal may ease the conditions demanded by the Communist army for Peiping.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 18th Dispatch] The Peiping City Council protested to the Communist army today about the more than one hundred shells that have fallen in the city, causing injuries and damage, demanding that the shelling stop. The siege of Peiping has now entered its sixth week. A novel development during this siege is the mobile military tribunal. Judges, guards, and executioners travel in trucks, conducting trials on the spot for those who violate martial law. Some executioners carry broadswords, but so far only five people have been executed by firing squad, and no beheadings have taken place.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 17th Dispatch] This morning, a shell landed 150 feet from the residence of the Vatican representative, Martina, and exploded immediately. According to Martina, the residence was shaken, but no one was injured.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 18th Dispatch] The fighting in the suburbs of Peiping has been quiet for the past two days, with no contact.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Reports received here today from Tianjin stated that the consulates of France, Italy, Belgium, Greece, and Switzerland have reported to their respective embassies in Nanjing that none of their nationals were injured when the Communist army shelled Tianjin, and the situation is currently very calm.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wu Meets with Foreign Envoys, Hoping to Stand Together with the Government; Ministry of Finance Dismissals Cause Disturbances</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Amid the government's active evacuation, Foreign Minister Wu has been in contact with foreign envoys to China, informing them of the government's future plans and hoping that they can stand together with the government if necessary. It is reported that most of the envoys have indicated that unless their respective governments issue special instructions, they will evacuate to safer areas with the government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The evacuation and downsizing of various ministries have gradually caused some unease and disturbances. Hundreds of dismissed officials and workers of the Ministry of Finance made demands to the ministry authorities on the afternoon of the 18th, hoping that: (1) In addition to the three months' salary and 3,000 yuan for travel expenses stipulated by the government, evacuation expenses could be increased. (2) Evacuation expenses should be issued immediately. To ensure the force of their demands, all officials and workers of the ministry were not allowed to leave. The front, back, and side doors of the ministry were locked, cutting off pedestrian traffic. Around 5:00 PM, they gathered in the minister's office building, demanding an immediate response. Because Minister Xu Kan was away on official business in Shanghai and had not yet returned, Vice Minister Yang Daoji responded, explaining that the government had done its best in making these arrangements. However, the crowd was agitated and remained adamant. Until 7:15 PM, Vice Minister Yang sincerely explained that increasing evacuation expenses was beyond the Ministry of Finance's power to decide, but that evacuation expenses could definitely be issued starting at noon on the 19th. The crowd then dispersed.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Zheng Visits British Foreign Secretary</h3>
<p>Providing Him with the Latest Information on the Situation in China</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 18th Broadcast: Chinese Ambassador to Britain Zheng Tianxi visited Foreign Secretary Bevin today, providing him with the latest information on the situation in China for his reference when answering questions in Parliament today regarding the situation in the Far East. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office declined to comment on the Soviet Union's refusal to mediate the Chinese civil war.</p>
<h3>Admiral Badger Declares that U.S. Troops Have Not Withdrawn from Qingdao</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City Dispatch] U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Badger stated on the 18th that reports in Chinese newspapers that the U.S. Marine Corps in Qingdao had already withdrawn are "completely unfounded." The U.S. Marine Corps in Qingdao has not withdrawn. Badger also reiterated his previous assurances that any such actions in the future would be officially announced.</p>
<h3>A Dangerous Gamble</h3>
<p>Congressman Judd Attacks U.S. Policy Towards China</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th Dispatch] Republican Congressman Judd stated on the 18th that the United States' policy of focusing on containing communism in Europe while "abandoning China to the communists" is nothing short of "a dangerous gamble." In the Congressional Record, Judd stated that, on the contrary, the massive strategic and psychological victory that communism has won in Asia will make our efforts to contain and defeat communism in Europe even more immense and difficult.</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Committee for Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction to Cease Operations Immediately</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 17th Dispatch] The Fujian Provincial Committee for Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction held a meeting on the afternoon of the 17th and resolved that in order to stabilize the local area and promote construction, peace must be sought first. It agreed with the Provincial Assembly's recommendation to abolish the Committee for Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction and will cease operations immediately to show its advocacy.</p>
<h3>News from Berlin: Soviet General Zhukov Commands Chinese Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 17th Dispatch] A communication licensed by the United States reported that, according to a German newspaper, the Chinese Communist Army is currently commanded by Soviet General Zhukov. It stated that this news was obtained from officers of the Soviet military government in Germany. According to them, the Soviet government's appointment of Zhukov as commander of the Odessa fortress was a cover for his mission in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Peiping's External Civil Aviation to Be Cut Off</h3>
<p>Personnel of Two Companies' Peiping Stations to Withdraw</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th Dispatch] China and Central Aviation Companies are scheduled to dispatch aircraft today to evacuate personnel from their Peiping stations, and Peiping's external civil aviation is likely to be cut off from this point forward.</p>
<h3>More Than Two Hundred National Assembly Delegates Remaining in Peiping Telegraph Sun Ke and Mao Zedong Separately, Requesting an Immediate Ceasefire and Sending Representatives to Negotiate Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] More than two hundred National Assembly delegates remaining in Nanjing held a meeting at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th, chaired by Ding Xuanxiao. Many opinions were expressed on the issue of peace and war. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that each person would freely sign and separately telegraph Premier Sun Ke and Mao Zedong in Yan'an, requesting them to consider the lives of the people, immediately cease fire, and send representatives to negotiate and jointly promote the realization of peace. The two telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Respectfully to Premier Sun Ke, Since the President issued a message on New Year's Day, proposing five principles for peace, the whole country rejoiced. We, the undersigned, have expressed our sincere support. Now the Communist Party has also put forward eight conditions for peace on the 14th, although the distance from the President's proposals is still far, it has clearly revealed the dawn of peace. In addition to requesting that they base their position on national independence and national freedom, and in view of the historical lessons that those who rely on virtue prosper and those who rely on strength perish, please reconsider the conditions for peace and immediately appoint appropriate personnel to negotiate with the Communist Party, seek effective ways to peace in every way, and both sides first cease military action, so that we can turn swords into ploughshares and put the people to rest. We urgently await your response.</p>
<p>(2) Respectfully to Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an, For several years, the people of the whole country have suffered from the scourge of war, with the strong scattered in all directions, and the old and weak abandoned in ditches. The suffering is indescribable. The nation's vitality has been lost, and the nation's survival is in danger. President Chiang, in view of this, issued a message on New Year's Day, proposing five principles for peace. The people of the whole country believe that the door to peace has been opened and are overjoyed. Recently, reading the newspapers, we saw that you also put forward eight conditions for peace on the 14th, and said, "The people of the whole country have already shown their will, and the people are eager to achieve peace as soon as possible." This shows that you have a desire for peace, which is deeply gratifying. However, the conditions for peace are still far apart. We urge you to consider the position of national independence and national freedom again. Considering the history of the past, those who rely on virtue prosper, and those who rely on strength perish. We especially hope that you will attach importance to the lives of the people and immediately cease military action. Both sides will send representatives to negotiate concrete ways to achieve peace, so that we can turn swords into ploughshares and put the people to rest. We are entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the people and cannot but speak, and cannot bear not to speak. We sincerely hope that peace will be realized immediately, so as to preserve the nation's vitality, strive for international status, and work hard to build a new China. It would be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Democratic and People's Parties Call for a Ceasefire between the Nationalists and Communists</h3>
<p>[This City Dispatch] The Chinese Democratic Party recently issued its views on the current situation, first analyzing Mao Zedong's eight statements, believing that the distance between the two sides is not very far and that there is much room for compromise. Therefore, it is quite optimistic about the future of peace. Secondly, it also put forward opinions on peace, calling on the Nationalists and Communists to immediately cease fire and start peace talks.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Chinese Democratic Party called for peace and issued its third telegram, addressed to Mao Zedong, stating briefly that since you are a new democrat, how can you bear to put China in a situation of eternal doom? We hope that you will have the determination of great benevolence and great courage to first cease fire and elect non-partisan figures to make preliminary negotiations. We also hope that the government will broaden its vision and invite all political parties in opposition to participate in the peace movement, and no longer close its doors to seek the effect of collective wisdom.</p>
<h3>Soviet Response Refuses Mediation; Suggests Direct Negotiations Between the Nationalists and Communists; United States and Britain Do Not Announce Contents of Response</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 17th Dispatch] Moscow Radio broadcast a communique from the Soviet government on the night of the 17th, stating that the Soviet government had refused the Chinese government's call for mediation in the Chinese civil war. The communique specifically pointed out that the Soviet response was delivered to Chuan Bingchang, the Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union. The response stated that in order to abide by its principle of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, the Soviet Union believes that it is unwise to accept China's proposal to participate in mediation. Not only that, but making China a democratic and peaceful country should be entirely a matter for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th Dispatch] Tass News Agency, broadcast by Moscow Radio and monitored here, stated that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky had delivered a note verbale stating the Soviet Union's position to Chuan Bingchang, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, on the 17th. According to the broadcast, the Soviet response pointed out that the Soviet Union "believes it is not appropriate to undertake mediation." The Soviet Union also suggested that the Chinese government negotiate directly with the Chinese Communists without foreign interference.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 17th Dispatch] State Department Press Liaison Officer McDermott declined to comment when reporters asked about the Nationalist government's request for mediation in the civil war by the United States, Britain, and France. He merely repeated relevant remarks made by Acting Secretary of State Lovett last week. Lovett told reporters last week that he had received a notification from the Chinese government, but declined to comment further. McDermott stated that Britain and France had also received the Chinese government's note verbale. When asked whether the note verbale had been answered, he replied that it had been answered, and cited news reports from the 15th of January to prove that Nanjing had received the response. The contents of the response were not disclosed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th Dispatch] Officials here today declined to comment on the Soviet Union's rejection of the Chinese government's invitation to mediate the civil war. It is reported that the United States, Britain, and France have all politely declined this suggestion from the Chinese government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will instruct the British Ambassador to Nanjing within days to inform the Chinese government that, in the current situation, it is difficult for Britain to mediate the Chinese civil war. However, the British Foreign Office remains tight-lipped about the Chinese government's application for mediation and the British government's response.</p>
<h3>Nanjing University Professors Call for Direct Negotiations between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Nanjing University Professors Wu Qiqu, Yu Jingyi, Liu Butong, Sun Mingjing, Ni Shangyuan, Ge Fuding, Zhao Mian, Ni Qingyuan, Chen Wenjuan, Yin Xizhong, and others issued the following statement on the 18th regarding their attitude toward peace: "We are dedicated to education and are pursuers of truth, justice, and humanity. For several years, we have consistently believed that domestic problems should not be resolved by military means, because this will not only lead to excessive sacrifices by the people, but also plunge the nation into danger and destruction. Today, we still uphold this view. The government's New Year's Day message and the Communist Party's positive response have clearly opened the door to peace. Now both sides must show sincerity, make appropriate concessions, immediately cease fire, and send representatives to begin direct negotiations to quickly end this cruel war. We also hope that intellectuals across the country will stand on the side of the people and urge both sides to realize peace. In short, the people of China today must survive, and the civil war must end immediately. We only know that the stability of the country and the welfare of the people are the urgent tasks at hand. We are not biased towards any side. We will wholeheartedly support and cooperate with anyone who can make the interests of the people the highest principle and guarantee the people's freedom, political democracy, and economic equality, so as to jointly seek their early realization."</p>

<h3>Cherish the People's Lives and Preserve the National Essence; The Chinese Peace Promotion Association Contributes a "Peace Negotiation Outline"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The Chinese Peace Promotion Association recently sent a telegram to President Chiang and Chairman Mao, asking them to adopt it. The original text is as follows: "The eight-year war of resistance has damaged the national vitality, and the three-year civil war has brought the national essence to the brink of collapse. Stopping the fighting and resuming peace is the unanimous demand of the whole country. Fortunately, the door to peace has been opened, and the conflict within the walls can be eliminated. We are overjoyed. However, considering that the conditions proposed by both sides are far apart, we are deeply afraid that the peace talks will fail and everything will be destroyed. Therefore, from the perspective of the interests of the people and with an absolutely fair attitude, we have shortened the distance between the two sides and contributed a 'Peace Negotiation Outline' for adoption. We respectfully ask you to cherish the lives of the people, preserve the national essence, be open and honest, and shake hands and make peace. If you adopt the methods proposed by our association as the basis for negotiations, we believe that the cruel war can be ended immediately, and the strength and prosperity of the country and nation can be expected soon. Even if we are mere whip-holders, we will not refuse to do so. Whether it is to bring rain or mud, good fortune or disaster, depends on the change of heart between the two sides. We enclose the outline and respectfully ask you to adopt it. We would be fortunate." The telegram is also attached with a peace negotiation outline, the content of which is the same as that proposed by the University Professors and the State Policy Research Association (see the first page of this newspaper on the 14th). However, in addition to Shanghai or Qingdao for the New Political Consultative Conference, the following item D has been added, stipulating the outline of joint governance as follows: (1) The Republic of China has complete territory and sovereignty, and its sovereignty belongs to all citizens.

<h3>Political Figures in Beijing Widely Study Peace; Zhang Junmai Returned to Shanghai from Beijing Last Night; Legislators Propose Convening a Provisional Session</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Judging from the atmosphere on the 18th, it will be difficult for the government to formulate a response to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) eight peace negotiation conditions within one or two days. However, political figures are clearly engaged in extensive discussions on the issue of peace.

After presenting their suggestions to the President, on the 18th they continued to make contact with various parties all day long. Vice President Li hosted a banquet for Zhang Junmai, Jiang Yuntian, Zhang Zhizhong, and Shao Lizi on the afternoon of the 18th to exchange opinions.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Legislative Yuan members plan to convene a provisional session to discuss major national policies.

Our Legislative Yuan, entrusted with the great responsibility by the people of the whole country as the highest representative body of public opinion, should make decisions and express its views at this moment in order to reverse the national fortune and avoid disaster. Article 69 of the Constitution stipulates that the Legislative Yuan may convene a provisional session at the request of more than one-fourth of the legislators. Therefore, according to the constitutional provision, please ask the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan to solicit the consent of more than one-fourth of the legislators to convene a provisional session of the Legislative Yuan in the near future to promptly discuss major policies and save the national crisis."</p>
<p>[Zhang Guoxing, Associated Press Correspondent in Beijing, 18th] A usually reliable source stated on the 18th that while the Sun cabinet has tentatively decided not to directly reject the CCP's counter-proposals, the Communist Party has announced that it is preparing to extend the "offensive of the People's Liberation Army" south of the Yangtze River to support Mao Zedong's message. It is said that the government is focusing on discussing the conditions and methods for reopening peace talks. As for technical issues such as the form and location of the peace conference, they have yet to be resolved.</p>
<p>Official observations on Mao Zedong's eight conditions are that the first condition, "severely punish war criminals," is absolutely unacceptable, while the remaining seven conditions are negotiable. The government's position on the seven conditions can be accurately summarized as follows: (1) Abolish the Constitution – modification can be considered. (2) Abolish the legitimacy of the government – concessions can be made, but basic legitimacy such as the republican system should be preserved. (3) Reorganize the army – according to the comprehensive plan for nationalizing the army, the Communist army should also be reorganized. (4) Confiscate bureaucratic capital and land reform – coincides with the government's policy, but technical details remain to be discussed. (5) Abolish "traitorous" treaties – the CCP treaties and related conventions of 1945 should also be considered in the overall review of foreign policy. (6) Hold a political consultative conference and organize a coalition government – acceptable, but the composition of the CPPCC and the coalition government, as well as other details, still need to be discussed.</p>

<h3>Pleading for the Countless Suffering Students!</h3>
<p>The winter vacation is over! The short vacation will soon be over, and the first semester of the thirty-eighth year of spring will begin. In today's world of soaring prices and difficult living conditions, the tuition issue for the next semester is a serious threat to middle- and lower-income families. Most college and high school students are also worried about this serious problem, worrying about the tuition for the next semester and panicking about impending unemployment. In principle, studying is a right that the next generation of young people should enjoy, and our Constitution also has clear provisions. However, in today's world of multiple difficulties, in addition to basic education, it is impossible for us to expect the government to fully assume the responsibility of educating the next generation of young people; therefore, rescuing young people who have dropped out of school must depend on the efforts of all sectors of society. In view of this, our newspaper has decided to continue to run the Reader Scholarship Fund, and from now on, we appeal to people from all walks of life to generously donate to help students in need, hoping to raise one million yuan in scholarship funds within a month to rescue five or six hundred young people who have dropped out of school.</p>
<p>Our newspaper has been running the Reader Scholarship Fund campaign since the Anti-Japanese War, and has run eight or nine sessions so far. Each session has rescued hundreds of young people who have dropped out of school, up to thousands of people, rescuing many students in need. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, our newspaper colleagues believed that it was necessary to hold this kind of social relief undertaking again. Since the autumn of the thirty-sixth year, this is now the fourth time. Fortunately, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have upheld the principle of "helping students is the most enjoyable" and generously donated large sums of money, rescuing no less than tens of thousands of young people who have dropped out of school, allowing them to continue their studies and complete their studies. Looking back at the situation of running the scholarship fund in the past, we cannot but thank the generosity of our readers for such a successful achievement. However, at the same time, we believe that there were shortcomings in the last scholarship fund, firstly because the prescribed procedures were too complicated and too slow, which was contrary to the original intention of helping students, and secondly because the malignant inflation of currency caused the value of the raised scholarship fund to fall too much, so that the recipients could not get much benefit. We cannot but consider this situation to be imperfect. This kind of situation must not happen again in the future scholarship fund. Therefore, our newspaper's first scholarship meeting decided to change the method:</p>
<p>First, private colleges and high schools in this city have decided to charge tuition fees in rice for the next semester, and our scholarship fund should also be based on rice. Therefore, it is decided to subsidize each junior high school student with one dan of Zhongbai japonica rice, each high school student with one dan and two dou, and each college student with one dan and five dou. At this time of uncertain situation, the inflation of the gold yuan is inevitable. In order to preserve the currency value, all donations are calculated in kind. In other words, the scholarship funds raised each day will be immediately used to purchase rice in the market and stored in rice shops; the scholarship funds will also be paid in rice in the future. In this way, not only can the currency value be preserved, but also the recipients can get practical benefits. The shortcomings of the previous session will not happen again.</p>
<p>Second, although our newspaper runs the scholarship fund voluntarily, it has cooperated with the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee in the past three sessions. Unfortunately, the committee's review takes a long time, and the schools' compilation of the list of free students often takes a long time, so that when the scholarship fund is issued, the currency value has fallen too much, so that the recipients cannot get much benefit, and those who donate large sums of money are even more disappointed because they cannot achieve the purpose of rescuing young people who have dropped out of school. If this situation is not changed, it will inevitably affect the fundraising of scholarship funds in the future. Therefore, our newspaper's scholarship fund will resume its initiative from this session and run it independently. As soon as school starts, we will automatically review the qualifications and academic performance of applicants from major colleges and high schools, and after deciding, we will issue the scholarship fund as soon as possible, and copy this list to the Unified Review Committee for reference to avoid duplication. In this way, although our newspaper runs it independently, it will not hinder the work of the Unified Review Committee.</p>
<p>In short, the scholarship fund campaign is the most meaningful social relief undertaking at present. On the one hand, we require the procedures to be as perfect as possible, and on the other hand, we hope that people from all walks of life can extend a compassionate hand, generously donate large sums of money, purchase and store rice for students, and rescue countless students in need to avoid displacement and dropping out of school. Rescuing one more student in need today will also save one more point of vitality for the next generation. Therefore, we want to plead for the countless suffering students to all sectors of society again!</p>
<h3>If China Forms Two Camps, the United Nations Will Encounter Difficulties; It Is Feared That It Will Shake the Foundation of the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chenggong Lake, 18th] China's split into two major camps, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, has become the biggest problem for the United Nations. Many United Nations diplomats are currently studying this issue. If the CCP announces the establishment of a government, and the National Government still claims to be the only legal regime in China, how should it be handled? One UN official said: Even if the mathematical genius Albert Einstein were alive, he would probably be dumbfounded and not know what to do. At the San Francisco Conference, at the insistence of the United States, all countries recognized China as one of the five powers, occupying a permanent seat on the Security Council and enjoying veto power. China is also a permanent member of the Trusteeship Council, and participates in the Economic and Social Council, as well as attending more than a dozen second-tier United Nations organizations. If the CCP controls the whole country, and the National Government surrenders the whole country, the solution is simple and easy, but it is not a blessing for Western countries. The communist China will then stride into the Security Council, and use its veto power to assist the Soviet Union, so that the Soviet Union, which has used too much veto power, can have a little rest. The CCP will also take over all the positions of the current government in the United Nations. However, the United Nations' dilemma is that once the National Government moves its capital to Taiwan and fights to the end in a semi-exile way, the United Nations will face the issue of which government represents China. Thousands of officials believe that this matter will shake the foundation of the United Nations. Since Western countries have an overwhelming majority in the United Nations General Assembly and various organizations, even if the CCP intends to do something, it is not difficult to defeat it. However, only a few people think that the solution is so simple. If there is no rift between the United States and the Soviet Union, the choice between the CCP government with 440 million miles and the powerless National Government is obvious. However, if this matter occurs in the current situation, and the United Nations must consider it, it is another matter. If the West wants the National Government to maintain its seat, it will be very difficult to explain to the countries of the world.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th] At a time when the whole country yearns for peace, the Communist Party continues to intensify its rebellious acts, regardless of the people's wishes. A document from the Communist Party, recently obtained by a certain related agency, proves that the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a "Conscription Order" to various Communist-controlled areas on New Year's Day, setting a deadline of February 15th of this year to mobilize one million strong men between the ages of 16 and 48 as soon as possible and send them to Handan, Hebei for centralized training.

<h3>Inflation in the Communist Area; Prices Rise Straight; The Situation in Jinan Can Be Seen</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 18th] According to merchants, one Gold Yuan can be exchanged for 100 North Sea banknotes in the areas surrounding Qingdao. When Jinan was abandoned, the exchange rate in Jinan was 20 to 30 yuan. This ratio is enough to prove that in the national currency inflation race, the Communist area has already run ahead.

<h3>Indonesian Government Asks Asian Conference for Effective Aid to Indonesia, Sends Letter to Nehru Condemning Security Council's Weak Attitude, Representatives of Various Countries Arriving in India Have Begun Contact</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 18th] The Indonesian provisional government established in Sumatra has sent a letter to Indian Prime Minister Nehru stating: We request that the Asian Conference convened on the 20th intervene in the conflict between Indonesia and the Netherlands in order to find appropriate methods to resolve this issue. It also stated that the Security Council cannot do anything for this issue other than the activities of the mediation committee for the conflicting parties. Considering Indonesia's years of resistance against Japan, Dutch aggression, and the fight against colonial policies, the Indonesian provisional government also requested the Asian Conference to provide Indonesia with the effective assistance it deserves.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New Delhi, 17th] Indonesian Republican officials said today that after the Asian countries conference initiated by Indian Prime Minister Nehru opens here on the 20th, the Indonesian delegation will formally propose economic sanctions against the Netherlands. The Indonesian Republic has submitted a memorandum to it, stipulating the timetable for the withdrawal of Dutch troops, the organization of a provisional government, and the establishment of an Indonesian Federation. If the United Nations agency cannot stop the continued aggression of the Dutch, the countries participating in the Asian Conference must prohibit Dutch airplanes and ships from carrying ammunition or troops from their territories, and provide Indonesia with material and financial assistance.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 18th] Representatives from various Asian countries participating in the Southeast Asian Conference have now arrived in New Delhi one after another. Representatives of various countries are now making informal contacts in New Delhi. It is reported that private consultations between representatives will be held in the palace of the King of Hyderabad in New Delhi, while the opening ceremony and formal meetings will be held in the Indian Parliament Building. According to observers, representatives of various countries have reached agreement on several points of principle regarding the Indonesian issue.

<h3>Indonesian Issue Ends General Debate, Four Countries to Submit New Proposals Today, Indonesia Urges Security Council to Take Action Before the 20th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 17th] According to well-informed sources, after the Security Council resumes its meeting on the 19th, China will jointly propose a resolution on the Indonesian issue with the United States, Norway, and Cuba. It is heard that the four countries have no fundamental differences of opinion on the content of the proposal. The proposal is largely the same as the draft secretly notified to various countries by the United States last Friday, with only slight revisions. The Security Council has completed the general debate on the Indonesian issue today, but has not taken action.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 18th] It is reported that the US delegation to the Security Council is drafting a proposal for the United Nations to supervise the gradual withdrawal of Dutch sovereignty in Indonesia. Security Council representatives are eager to decide on action on the 19th in order to prevent the possibility of the Asian countries conference convened in New Delhi on the 20th from automatically adjudicating the event in view of the lack of action by the Security Council. India, in its capacity as the host of the New Delhi conference, has repeatedly assured that any action will be included in the United Nations organization, but Indian Ambassador Lei He wants the Security Council to expedite action so that the New Delhi conference can begin in a "different atmosphere." US Representative Jessup agreed with Lei He's point of view, "There was originally a very large agreement among the Security Council member states on the Indonesian issue. It would still be unfortunate if the possibility of this agreement was diluted due to disagreement on any details." Jessup also agreed with the view of Indonesian representative Bila that "It would still be unfortunate if we take an incomplete resolution." According to the rules of procedure, the United States needs to obtain the support of seven countries in the Security Council in order to pass any resolution. Therefore, the United States may have to make some slight revisions to its position in order to obtain a guarantee of passage. It is generally believed that the US proposal should include Jessup's proposed "schedule" and most of the points raised by Lei He on the 17th. It is reported that the United Kingdom will support this proposal, while the Soviet Union believes that the greatest crisis lies in France. If the resolution is worded too strongly, France may exercise its veto power. Previously, France had exercised its veto power once in the Indonesian incident.</p>

"We also believed that there would be no changes in the US military strategy, but we want to know how we can effectively perform our joint duties and fulfill our obligations to the United States."

<h3>The United States Should Strengthen Its Air Force to Deal with Future Wars</h3>
<p>The View Held by Most Congressmen</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Navy Minister Sullivan said that the Navy needs more funding. The political report said that the Navy Department needs more funding to keep pace with the atomic age. It is estimated that the funds needed before the end of June this year will exceed the original amount by 1 billion yuan. The Navy Department cannot continue to reduce equipment to invest: Under the current difficult situation, all scheduled plans cannot be completed. Technological advancements have greatly increased the speed, range, power, and efficiency of weapons, aircraft, and warships. Maintaining a strong navy to prevent attacks in the future will cost a lot. The navy is a major part of national defense and will continue to cooperate with the army and air force to exert its military power to deal with any aggression. However, some senators believe that the Air Force is more important than the Navy. According to Hill, a Democratic member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, if defense spending is increased, the increased portion must be given to the Air Force. Thomas, chairman of the Military Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, also said that he firmly believes that future wars will be based on air power. It is expected that the Air Force will soon become the foundation of the US military construction. According to Taft, chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, on the whole, I do not oppose expanding the Navy. The Navy should be kept modern, but the proposed budget of 4 billion yuan is too much. According to President Truman's recent budget message to Congress, he advocated a defense expenditure of 14 billion yuan this year, which will be shared by the Army, Navy, and Air Force.</p>

The committee is expected to be formally established in early February, with the goal of assisting Czech refugees within the Western sphere, making contact with non-communist elements within the Czech Republic, and working to restore a democratic Czech state. Since the recent arrival of Czech Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Hejtmar in this country, the activities of Czech leaders have become even more active. Hejtmar reported to the State Department that the Communist Party has now completely controlled Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union is transforming Czechoslovakia and Poland into industrial centers in order to extract their products for its own construction. There are no signs of preparation for an invasion war by Soviet troops in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Czech exiled politicians have joined a large group of exiled politicians and civil servants from other countries, preparing to one day return to non-communist countries. In other words, Washington, like London and Paris, has become a center for anti-communist exiled governments, with various contacts penetrating deep into the Eastern European underground.</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 17th] Rumors are rife in Prague that several high-ranking generals have been arrested for a conspiracy to overthrow the Gottwald government. However, the authorities deny uncovering a large-scale conspiracy and only acknowledge that a portion of military officers and civilians have been imprisoned. General Gottwaldser, former commander of the Moravian military region, is among them and has been under arrest for quite some time. Communist leaders have bitterly denounced Prague for becoming a battleground for ideological warfare of the Cold War.</p>

<h3>"Deng Keng" and "New Ruian" Ships Collide at Wusong Port; Passengers Fortunately Unharmed</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The "New Ruian" ship of the Ruian Company, with a gross tonnage of 919 tons, operating on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line, sailed from Fuzhou to Shanghai on the 16th of this month, carrying over 400 tons of cargo and 129 passengers. Yesterday afternoon at approximately 1:00 PM, upon arrival at Wusong Port and while proceeding inward, the "Deng Keng" ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was calibrating its compass in Wusong Port. Unexpectedly, the two ships collided. The rear cabin on the starboard side of the "New Ruian" ship was damaged and breached, and water immediately entered. Upon receiving the news, the captain immediately increased speed and steered toward a shallow area, running aground on a sandbar, avoiding sinking. An emergency call was immediately sent out. Because the location was near the first buoy near the Wusong Port exit (i.e., the Lismore Channel), the Harbor Quarantine Station, Jianghai Customs, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and others immediately dispatched tugboats and other vessels stationed at Wusong to rescue the passengers. All passengers from the "New Ruian" ship were safely rescued and transported back to Shanghai on small boats from the Harbor Quarantine Station and other organizations. The Ruian Company immediately hired two iron barges from the China Transport Company to unload the cargo and then find a way to tow the ship to Shanghai for repairs. According to the report from the "Deng Keng" ship, it was calibrating its compass in Wusong Port at the time, and upon encountering the "New Ruian" ship entering the port, it sounded its horn twice, and the "New Ruian" ship also responded twice. However, at that time, it was near Shigen Reef, and it was impossible to reverse the ship. Furthermore, due to strong winds and rapid currents, the collision occurred. The "Deng Keng" ship was sailing to Hong Kong and Bangkok, carrying approximately 2,000 tons of goods such as gauze. It set sail from the anchorage outside the port at 2:00 PM on the 17th, originally planning to calibrate its compass yesterday before sailing south. Unexpectedly, the accident occurred. The bow of the ship was also slightly damaged at a depth of 9 feet. It is temporarily anchored at Wusong Port awaiting inspection. If there is no major damage, it will sail south immediately; otherwise, it will return to Shanghai for repairs. The issue of liability for the collision will be determined after investigation by the Shanghai Maritime Administration.</p>

The foreman resigned due to illness on the 15th of this month, and the company immediately planned to cancel the tailoring department.

<h3>Uncertainty Remains Regarding Oil and Coal Distribution; Public and Educational Personnel to be Held Responsible</h3>
<p>Among the five-item coupon issued by the Shanghai Municipal Public and Education Personnel Materials Supply Committee to public and educational personnel for the distribution of rice, coal, cooking oil, sugar, and salt, the distribution of coal and cooking oil is often delayed. In particular, the cooking oil that should have been supplied by the China Vegetable Oil Plant has not been distributed for three months, from November of last year to this month. The coal that should have been supplied by the Four Mines Joint Operations Office was uniformly converted to cash subsidies in November of last year, with a value of only one-third of the market price at that time. The distribution has not occurred in December and this month either. Public and educational personnel across the city have expressed deep indignation and will hold the Public and Education Personnel Materials Supply Committee accountable.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Buses Once Cease Operations This Morning; Company Decides to Advance Year-End Bonus; Workers Resume Work after Persuasion</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Workers at the Municipal Public Transport Company briefly went on strike this morning, demanding the early supplementary issuance of the insufficient portion of the year-end bonus calculated based on this month's index. All bus stations ceased operations at 8:30 AM. After persuasion from company authorities and the company's Workers' Welfare Association, work resumed at around 10:00 AM, and by 11:00 AM, vehicles at all stations had returned to normal operation.</p>
<p>According to the company's Welfare Association, the company's year-end bonus was previously calculated based on 18.3 times the December index of last year and had already been issued. Subsequently, the company authorities, complying with the workers' request for the same treatment as the six major public utilities, recalculated the year-end bonus based on this January's index and made a preliminary payment of 30 times the amount. Yesterday was the day to supplement the 11.7 times portion (because 18.3 times had already been issued). It was originally scheduled to supplement another 18.04 times on the 22nd of this month to reach a total of 48.04 times. However, the workers, in view of the escalating prices and the more than doubling of the household rice price starting yesterday, suffered significant losses. Although the Welfare Association had notified the workers to purchase household rice before the 17th, the workers could not afford it at the time, resulting in delays. Therefore, the workers were very indignant about this yesterday morning, and the public's emotions were also agitated. The increase in the household rice price can be said to be the immediate cause of this strike.</p>
<p>As a result, both parties agreed: the 11.7 times portion of the year-end bonus will still be issued yesterday, the remaining 18.04 times will be issued early on the 20th, and the salary for the second half of this month will be advanced to the 24th.</p>
<h3>Registered and Insured Letters May Now Contain Cash; Post Office to Handle Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] To facilitate the remittance of funds for dispersed populations and strengthen service, the post office has specifically stipulated that Gold Yuan notes can be included in registered and insured letters, up to a maximum of 500 yuan per letter, and up to 50 yuan for letters sent to Taiwan Province. For now, the service is limited to inter-postal remittances between first, second, and third-class post offices. The insurance fee will be charged based on the declared amount in Gold Yuan, according to the postal money order fee rate between the sending and receiving post offices. If this is lower than the originally determined insurance fee amount, the originally determined insurance fee will be charged. When mailing, a sturdy and opaque envelope should be used. After placing the banknotes inside, a special free seal provided by the post office should be affixed to the envelope's opening. Two Chinese-style seals should be placed at the top and bottom, and one Western-style seal should be placed in the middle. The sender's private seal should also be affixed. If there is no private seal, the post office will affix the date stamp on the spot. If the sender includes banknotes in a registered and insured letter without declaring it to the post office or if the declared amount is inaccurate, and the post office staff suspects something, they must verify it in person or, after receiving the letter, directly notify the delivery office to inform the recipient to open and retrieve the contents in person. If it is confirmed that there is non-declaration or underreporting, the recipient will be charged double the remittance fee for the full amount or the difference. The Municipal Postal Administration and its affiliated branches, inland offices, and Jiangwan Postal Affairs Office have all determined to start accepting these letters from tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Two Major Fires in the South City in the Morning and Evening; Squatter Huts on Fuxing East Road and Outside Xian Gua Street Unfortunate; Each Destroyed Over a Hundred Units, Many Dead and Injured</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] At 9:30 PM last night, a major fire broke out on Chuanjia Street, Fuxing East Road, in the South City, destroying over a hundred squatter huts. The fire started in a squatter hut owned by a certain person behind the Manlita Bridge Police Station of the Yimiao Branch of the Public Security Bureau on Fuxing East Road. After the fire started, it spread extremely quickly due to the strong northwesterly wind. After spotting the fire, the South City Firefighting Federation Lookout immediately notified the Fire Department and the firefighting associations of various sections in the South City to dispatch vehicles to extinguish the fire. However, water sources were scarce in the area, so within half an hour, all the squatter huts in the area were engulfed. The area ranged north to Xuexian Street, east to Guangqi Road, west to Chuanjia Street, and south to Fuxing East Road. Fortunately, nearby residential buildings were spared thanks to high walls. The fire gradually subsided at 10:30 PM. When the fire was raging, squatter Wang Deqing, his wife Zhou, and their young son Wang Didi were burned and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, Wang's five-year-old son Wang Amao did not escape and was buried in the flames.</p>
<p>[This newspaper] The squatter huts outside Xiaodongmen, Xian Gua Street, in the South City, were densely packed, totaling over a thousand units. Unexpectedly, at approximately 7:30 AM yesterday morning, Ding Kehua, a firecracker manufacturer in squatter hut number 229 in the alleyway, was careless. Due to the strong wind, the gunpowder caught fire and quickly became a conflagration. The Yimiao Police Branch, which was located nearby, was notified and Branch Chief Qi Jingzhi telephoned the firefighting associations of various sections in the South City, as well as the firefighting branches in Songshan and Xin Kaihe, all of whom dispatched pumper trucks to put out the fire. However, the streets in the area were narrow, and some fire hydrants were frozen, so firefighters had to draw water from the Huangpu River and intensify pumping from unfrozen hydrants, making firefighting extremely difficult. Fire Chief Zhang Qian also arrived on the scene to direct operations. After an hour of efforts to extinguish the fire, it gradually subsided. Unburned shacks were pulled down to prevent the fire from spreading. The fire was completely extinguished at approximately 9:00 AM. It was estimated that over a hundred shacks were destroyed. Afterward, firefighters dug out two bodies from the rubble, one large and one small. The larger one was approximately forty years old, and the smaller one was only a few years old. Both were charred beyond recognition and were a gruesome sight. No one from the nearby residents has yet claimed the bodies. As of dusk, Yimiao Branch police officers are continuing to investigate with the local headmen (baojia). The fire starter, Ding Kehua (32 years old), was taken to the police station by a beat officer for questioning about the cause of the fire.</p>

<p>Relief Funds for the Family of Wang Wenxiao</p>
<p>Eight Japanese salvage experts who were hired to assist in the salvage of the "Jiangya" vessel in Shanghai visited Huang Muzong, the manager of the shipping department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, on the 18th to discuss everything. According to Manager Huang, all materials related to the construction, operation, and accident of the "Jiangya" vessel have been handed over to them for research. They are scheduled to begin work on the 20th. The first stage of their work will be to enter the water to investigate the damage to the "Jiangya" vessel and then, based on the extent of the damage, study the main cause of the accident and how to start the salvage.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Relief Association, Wang Wenxiao, an employee of the Shanghai China Tobacco Factory, unfortunately died in the "Jiangya" vessel accident. His relatives specially donated the 2,250 Gold Yuan in compensation issued by the factory's industrial union for the winter relief effort.

<p>The Economic Cooperation Administration recently announced that the Economic Cooperation Administration has taken action to help resolve the coal shortage in Qingdao and Shanghai. It is reported that 25,000 tons of American aid coal will be delivered to Qingdao and Shanghai within this month.

<h3>Emergency Relief and Review Committee Issues Statement on Malnutrition Among Refugee Children</h3>
<p>[Taibao News] The Shanghai District Children's Emergency Relief Work Review Committee recently stated that regarding the fact that children in child care institutions are having difficulty getting enough to eat due to high prices, the committee's relief target is mainly the children already housed in various child care institutions. The Ministry of Social Affairs and the United Nations stipulate a daily supplementary meal providing 500 calories of food, which has been correctly calculated by experts. However, the committee is unable to provide the entire amount due to regulations and is therefore not fully responsible. At present, there are a total of 101 agencies in the city that handle the distribution of milk powder and food, distributed in various districts of the city. In addition to vegetable money being issued every ten days and firewood being issued every month, the remaining milk powder, soybeans, rice, fat, and salt are issued every three months. As for the transportation work, due to the large quantities issued each time and the large number of institutions, the receiving institutions must actually transport the goods themselves, and it is difficult to deliver them one by one.</p>

<h3>Three Perpetrators Who Incited Gamblers to Rob Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Taibao News] Fan Guozhu and Qian Yuchun, who were addicted to gambling, met their friend Li Miaosheng at the Yile Theater one night last winter after losing at gambling. Li told the two that Shi Xuekun's house behind the Catholic Church had gold jewelry and other items, and after taking them to check the location, Fan and Qian went to rob the house late the next night, stealing a considerable amount of gold jewelry and clothing. They were subsequently arrested by the police and transferred to the court. Yesterday, Judge Guo Zugan of the District Court concluded the trial and sentenced Fan Guozhu and Qian Yuchun to four years of imprisonment for jointly intending to illegally possess other people's property and taking their belongings by violence and coercion, making them unable to resist. Zhu Miaosheng was sentenced for inciting the crime.</p>
<h3>Military Troops Stationed in Factories; Production Likely to be Affected; Three Groups Telegraph Request for Proper Accommodation Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Industrial Association, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly telegraphed the Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Command yesterday, stating that the stationing of military troops in factories and warehouses would affect production and cause shutdowns, requesting that the "Measures for Military Organs and Troops Renting Civilian Houses" promulgated by the Executive Yuan and the regulations on accommodation for the National Army transiting through the country be followed to properly arrange accommodation. The original telegram reads: It has come to our attention that in recent months, the number of troops transferred through or stationed in Shanghai has been greater than usual. After arriving in Shanghai, these troops have failed to comply with the "Measures for Military Organs and Troops Renting Civilian Houses" and the "Measures for Accommodation for the National Army Transiting Through the Country" promulgated by the Executive Yuan. For the most part, they have taken over factories and warehouses on their own.</p>
<p>According to reports from various industries</p>
<p>that have been filed with the Chamber of Commerce, such as the Wuzhou Gu Ben Soap Factory at 5 Jinyi Bridge, Xujiahui, the Xinfu Luan Line Factory at 553 Huining Road, the British Velvet Factory on Weidemei Road, the Xu Songsheng Sauce Garden Warehouse at 90 Yutong Road, and the unfinished civilian houses built by the Guilan Ji Construction Factory on Baoyuan Road, Doushan Road, Zhabei, the Chamber of Commerce has sent telegrams in the names of Hai Zhen, Zi Hui, Zi Zhen, Zi Wen, and Zi Han, reporting to your department</p>
<p>and requesting a transfer for discussion</p>
<p>and immediate evacuation. To date, not a single place has been returned, and the number of troops arriving in Shanghai is increasing day by day. In the past, factories that were about to start construction were partially occupied (such as the British Velvet Factory). Later, factories that were already in operation were also occupied as a matter of course (such as the Wuzhou Gu Ben Factory and the Xinfu Luan Line Factory), making it difficult to manage the mixed military and industrial operations, and fear is unavoidable, which will inevitably lead to forced shutdowns. At a time when defense deployments are being intensified, the occupation continues to occur. I fear that before the flames of war reach Shanghai, a large number of workers will have no work to do, which will</p>
<p>affect production</p>
<p>and affect the overall situation. I believe that at a time of tense circumstances, there is "tangible defense" and "intangible defense." Intangible defense lies in the peace of farmers in their fields, the peace of merchants in their markets, and the peace of workers in their factories, so that the four peoples can live in peace in their respective professions, and the seven don't be surprised, and the peace is undisturbed. Otherwise, the current emergency loans will become nothing more than empty gestures, and at this time of hardship, a sudden increase in the number of unemployed workers will add to the anxieties. If it is due to a lack of barracks in the military area and a lack of public houses, your department should follow the provisions in the second half of Article 4 of the measures for accommodation for the National Army transiting through the country (that is, building sheds), and properly arrange for accommodation. Settling people's hearts is the way to consolidate morale. We respectfully submit this sincere appeal as a humble offering, hoping that it will be considered, approved, and implemented. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Industrial Association, Federation of Trade Unions, together kowtow, Zi Xiao.</p>

<h3>Accusation and Arrest for Performing Abortion for Prostitute</h3>
<p>Zhang Peijun, a 21-year-old prostitute from Meilongzhen Brothel at 25 Shantou Road, became pregnant two months ago. Finding it inconvenient to continue her trade, she went to the house of Wang Cuiying, a woman at 5 Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road, on the afternoon of the 7th of this month to have an abortion, accompanied by Li, the madam of the brothel. Li promised to pay 1,000 Gold Yuan as compensation. After the procedure, she went to the house of Zhong Lanying at 17 Alley 129, Zhejiang Road, to recuperate. The other day, Zhang Peijun's condition suddenly worsened and became very dangerous. After Zhong questioned her, she learned about the abortion and immediately accompanied Zhang to Hongren Hospital.

<h3>Finance Minister Xu Receives Representatives from the Financial Community to Explain the Contents of Gold Public Bonds; Hopes for Support and Assistance from the Financial Community</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Finance Minister Xu Kan received representatives from the domestic and foreign financial community in the city at the National Bank Conference Room at 5:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Song Hanzhang, Huo Baoshu, Qin Runqing, Zhao Dihua, Wang Zhixin, Xu Jiqun, Wang Xiaolai, Gu Shanchang, Shen Rixin, Xu Guomao, and Arnold, a representative of Citibank, and Stans, a representative of HSBC, and others. First, Xu explained the contents of the gold short-term public bonds, saying that the bond fund would be transferred to the Fund Management Committee on the date of issuance. The storage and management of this fund would be handled entirely by the Management Committee, so the creditworthiness of the bonds was extremely reliable. He hoped that the financial community would support the government's policies and provide assistance in various ways. He said that suggestions would be adopted as much as possible. Regarding the resumption of stock exchange and the reasonable reorganization of old public bonds, the Ministry of Finance would be responsible for handling them.</p>
<p>After Xu's speech, the attendees stood up one after another to express their opinions. Song Hanzhang and Zhao Dihua both stated that gold public bonds were reliable and trustworthy and believed that they could gain the trust of the people. Xu Jiqun believed that organizing a syndicate to sell public bonds was indeed the duty of banks, but today, floating capital did not go through banks, so its strength was limited. He hoped that the stock exchange could be resumed immediately to open up a new outlet for floating capital and that gold public bonds could be listed to make trading more flexible, so that sales could be smooth. In his speech, Wang Xiaolai said that the industrial and commercial communities had always supported government orders and would do their best to promote sales. He also hoped that the government would understand the suffering of the people and put the interests of the people first in everything. Stans, a representative of a foreign bank, said in his speech that China's financial measures were closely related to foreign banks. The gold public bonds had excellent conditions, and he hoped that all parties would cooperate to achieve great results. The reception ended at 6:30 PM, and Finance Minister Xu took a car back to Nanjing last night.</p>
<h3>Affected by High Rationed Rice Prices, Rice Prices Rise Initially but Then Fall; Flour, Grains, and Shantou Cakes All Fall Yesterday</h3>
<p>The rice market rose yesterday. The Nanshi market rose and then fell back to level. Because rationed rice prices were adjusted dynamically and started to rise yesterday, people were unusually bullish, and dealers held on to their goods strongly, causing prices to rise by 100 yuan. White japonica and thin indica rice were each priced at 1,700 yuan in the Beishi market, and early rice was priced at 1,660 yuan, each rising by 100 yuan. Xian rice rose by 50 to 60 yuan, while white yuan and yin yuan were stable. The Nanshi market also rose by 100 yuan at the beginning, but due to tight credit and fewer deliveries, it fell back down. White japonica remained at 1,600 yuan, and other types of rice remained at their original prices, and the market was sluggish and tired. The market received 8,617 dan of goods yesterday.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Fell. Due to very tight credit and high black market interest rates, dealers were eager to sell, and the selling atmosphere was strong. Lao Che and Bingchuan were still above 600 yuan at the beginning, but fell below 600 yuan after a series of sales. Lao Che closed at 580 yuan, down 40 yuan. Bingchuan closed at 565 yuan, down 43 yuan. Hongfeng was 565 yuan, and Jiancheng was 555 yuan, down 35 and 45 yuan. Large bags of wheat bran fell by more than 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Fell across the board. Due to extremely tight credit and high black market interest rates, dealers were eager to sell, but buyers were few and far between, and people were unanimously bearish. Yellow beans fell straight down. Hankou Che beans were initially priced at 900 yuan, but finally traded at 820 yuan at the close, a sharp drop of more than 20% compared to yesterday. Corn fell by 200 yuan across the board, and few people inquired about it in the afternoon market. Sesame was absorbed by exporters, down slightly by more than 100 yuan.

Soybean oil opened at 4,800 yuan, fell as low as 4,400 yuan, and closed at 4,600 yuan, down 600 yuan. Raw vegetable oil closed at 3,600 yuan, down 700 yuan.

In addition, each unit using or increasing cash for exchanging head position was not allowed to exceed ten times; otherwise, they would not be eligible to apply.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Fall Downstream</h3>
<p>The sugar market was extremely soft yesterday afternoon. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the industry was arranging its positions, and sales were rampant. In the morning, the available goods were loose and excessive, and buyer absorption decreased, resulting in a downstream trend all the way down. All levels opened at low prices, with more selling than buying in the middle, and prices were unable to hold.</p>
<p>No. 45 white refined sugar closed at 2880 yuan in the afternoon, falling back 420 yuan. Coarse sand fell 270 yuan. The market was soft at all other levels. Some holders, seeing the excessive downward trend, were still unwilling to sell, and no transactions were opened.</p>
<h3>Committee Members for Small Factory Loans Being Recruited</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to provide loans to small factories, the National Bank has formed a temporary loan review committee for small factories.

The number of loan applicants has been quite enthusiastic in recent days.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Trading Sparsely</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market: there was still sparse trading in ordinary goods, and as for high-quality goods, since the shortage of goods, the process has been quiet for a long time. Although the trend is in the midst of frequent tight credit, the stability of the holders' minds is commendable, and everyone is reluctant to let go, so they still stand firm. Prices are also quite firm. According to people in the industry, the shops on this street are currently stepping up their efforts to add various styles in order to meet the actual needs of the market at the end of the lunar year.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Tightening of Monetary Supply, Interbank Lending Rates Hit New Peak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank monetary supply continued to be tight after a sharp tightening in the afternoon of the previous day. In the morning, various institutions lacking funds urgently sought interbank lending of cash, as overnight positions had not been settled, in order to pay the Central Bank for security deposits. The tightness intensified sharply before noon, making turnover extremely difficult. The implicit interest rate on overnight loans rose from 80 yuan per day to over 100 yuan at one point. The market price varied depending on the need, approaching chaos.</p>
<p>Cash leverage was particularly tight in yesterday's market, as many internal institutions had already used it to pay the Central Bank's security deposits. Yesterday morning, customers were largely unable to withdraw funds. Due to the current situation, there were clear signs of capital fleeing south. Large bills were discounted at around 6%.</p>
<p>Further news: The prices of all commodities, except for rice, fell across the board. The interest offered in various markets varied. The rubber market once reached around 100 yuan, while the silk and cotton yarn markets also stood high between 80 and 90 yuan. Only the rice market had a uniquely low price, ranging from 60 to 70 yuan.</p>
<p>Since the abolition of the gold and silver exchange system, it has been rumored in the market that the Central Bank is secretly selling large amounts of gold on the market to help tighten the money supply. Responsible parties at the National Bank claimed to be unaware of the above news, neither acknowledging nor denying it.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Silk Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market experienced a sharp downturn. Monetary supply in the market was extraordinarily tight, with daily interbank lending rates as high as 100 yuan per thousand, which many found unbearable. Liquidations were frequent, and the market closed with a general decline.</p>
<p>The 120 Bridge opened in the morning with a low price of 66,000 yuan. After opening, news of rising gold prices calmed sentiment, and the market slightly improved, with activity increasing and prices rising slightly by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Subsequently, the monetary supply suddenly tightened, foreign exchange certificates continued to fall, and the black market for finance also shrank. Buying interest dissipated, and by noon, various groups believed that the decline could not go any further and renewed their buying interest. The downward trend finally stabilized, closing at 66,500 yuan, a drop of around 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw silk was affected by the repeated decline in foreign exchange transfer certificates. The prices of various external goods deteriorated, sentiment weakened, and it was impossible to raise prices. Market buying interest was especially scarce, and trading was thin. Top-grade silk opened at a low price of 76,000 yuan, and transactions were not brisk. The market was weak.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk weaving market also experienced a sharp decline. Buying interest in the market was sluggish, and sales were continuous, with retail investors especially eager to sell. Top grades lacked the strength to rally. The market opened low, with Meiya quoting 43,500 yuan in the morning. The market softened slightly in the middle, and finally, external prices universally declined. The financial black market initially weakened then rose, before softening again. Sentiment was overwhelmingly bearish, and the market declined further, closing at 42,800 yuan at noon, a drop of around 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Continues Selling, Cotton Yarn Trends Downward, Cloth Sales Sluggish and Selling Pressure Pervasive</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Corporation continued to sell yarn on behalf of the National Bank and the US Aid Committee. Affected by the tight monetary supply, the market for yarn narrowed. Only 39 customers purchased a total of 215 bales, all of which were allocated at a price of 10,251,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, yarn was offered for sale in five rounds. As a result, 82 bales of 20-count Double Globe were sold at 39,000 yuan per bale. 73 bales of 42-count Double Strand Blue Phoenix were sold at 64,000 yuan per bale. 19 bales of 20-count Gold Double Horse were sold at 38,000 yuan per bale. 3 bales of 40-count Red Douguang were sold at 59,000 yuan per bale. 38 bales of 20-count Heavenly Maiden were sold at 39,000 yuan per bale.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market was weak, and the prices of most external goods trended downward. Sales to other ports further narrowed, and coupled with the unprecedentedly tight monetary supply, cargo owners were eager to sell due to high interest rates. There was continuous selling pressure in the market, while buyers were bearish and reluctant to enter the market. As a result, trading within the market was sparse.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened at 69,000 yuan, once dropping to 65,000 yuan before closing at 68,000 yuan, a drop of 7,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix experienced a significant drop of 12,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon ultimately fell by 9,500 yuan, closing at 5,300 yuan.</p>
<p>Spot 1-count Double Horse fell from 47,000 yuan to a low of 45,000 yuan, before recovering to the 50,000 yuan level at noon, a drop of 4,000 yuan. Factory orders once approached the 40,000 yuan level, before ultimately settling at 41,500 yuan, a drop of 5,500 yuan. One-day arbitrage initially traded at 4,000 yuan, but at noon, some were willing to sell at 2,500 yuan. Trading in other yarns was sluggish, and the market softened accordingly.</p>
<p>Cloth sales were sluggish, and the monetary supply in the market was even tighter, with daily interest rates around 1 yuan. As a result, merchants were under pressure from high interest rates and eager to sell. Selling pressure in the market suddenly intensified, but there were few buyers. As a result, various markets experienced a uniform and sharp decline.</p>
<p>First-grade fine cloth initially quoted 1,950 yuan. Ultimately, it was around 1,800 yuan. Five Happiness fine cloth declined from 1,900 yuan to 1,840 yuan, a final drop of 4,330 yuan. Trumpet Child fine cloth fell by 480 yuan, closing at 1,620 yuan. Other grades such as B First-Grade and Big Double Dragon all fell by 300 to 400 yuan.</p>

<h3>Government Launches Large-Scale Sales of Materials to Stabilize Prices with Confidence</h3>
<p>After the heads of the Ministries of Finance, Industry and Commerce, Food, and Accounting convened a meeting on prices in Shanghai, concrete decisions have been made regarding future policies for stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>According to Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weizhi, who attended the meeting, the government has decided to stabilize prices by selling materials and tightening the money supply. The government currently controls a large amount of rice, coal, yarn, and foreign exchange certificates, which provides confidence in controlling prices. In the future, relevant agencies will closely coordinate and make large-scale sales as needed. Control over the financial commodity market will also be closely monitored. Furthermore, the prices of public utilities will be stabilized to avoid stimulating inflation. The technical issues of opening the securities market are currently being studied. The main point is how to make securities trading play a role in absorbing idle funds and assisting the development of industry and commerce, while eliminating speculative activities. For this purpose, the margin for securities trading needs to be raised to 75% to 100%. Once the technical issues have been resolved, the resumption of business can be realized. Liu Weizhi is scheduled to return to Beijing by night train on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Separately Stipulates the Amount of Cash Travelers Can Carry Domestically and Internationally</h3>

<h3>Prelude to the Basketball League: Hua Lian Wins Narrowly Against Encas, Tense Game Ends 53-47</h3>

As a result, Hua Lian won narrowly with a score of 53-47. Li Zhenzhong proved his veteran status with a remarkable performance.</p>
<p>Referee Zheng Zhifang and Tao Boling officiated. After the start of the game, Wu Chengzhang of Hua Lian was the first to score, and Encas refused to be outdone, with V. Kairoski immediately responding. Liang Xiong scored a basket, and the game immediately became a seesaw battle. After a score of 6-5, Qu Libot broke through, taking a 7-6 lead. Encas gained momentum and progressed all the way, achieving a 19-12 advantage. Subsequently, the Hua Lian players stepped up their attacks, which proved effective. Three baskets were scored in succession, closing the gap to 18-19. Encas's Founik scored two baskets, adding four points. Zhenzhong demonstrated his skills, and at the end of the first half, Hua Lian took a narrow lead of 24-23. After the break, both teams adjusted their lineups. V. Kairoski and Ochai Liao scored successively. Hua Lian tightened their defense, and Da Li and Adi also made contributions, tying the score at 26, 28, and 32, making the game extremely tense. After that, the game turned in Hua Lian's favor, taking the lead. Zhenzhong and Adi performed excellently, and Encas was suppressed and unable to recover. Until the end of the game, Hua Lian narrowly defeated Encas with a score of 53-47.</p>

<h3>Friendly Soccer Match in Nanshi: Dongxing Wins by One Goal Against Huaguang, Cold Weather and Strong Wind, Over 1,500 Spectators</h3>
<p>The Huaguang and Dongxing soccer teams held a friendly match at the sports field yesterday. The weather was cold and the wind was strong, with over 1,500 spectators. Huaguang opened the scoring, but Dongxing responded with two goals, becoming the score at the half, which was also the final result. Huaguang's defense was solid, but their forward line was weaker. Dongxing's players were balanced and strong, and in terms of skill, Dongxing was slightly better. Their attacks were also stronger, so they were able to win 2-1. Both goalkeepers performed well, with Wu Qixiang of Huaguang being the most outstanding. He not only saved many dangerous shots, but also created many attacks. Dongxing's five forwards were active and showed strong penetration, and the defense also had good tactics, especially Li Chengxian and Zheng Bingyi, who were very competent.</p>
<p>In the first half, Huaguang was playing against the wind. Dongxing adopted an offensive strategy from the beginning. After eight minutes, Huaguang broke through the heavy defense, and the ball was sent forward from the right. After Qian Yunqing's pass, Qu Yongfu broke out and scored with a shot, opening the scoring. Afterwards, Dongxing, aided by the wind, continued to pressure Huaguang. Le Dequan and Lu Qitang defended on the left and right, and Wu Qixiang intercepted in the middle. Although Chen Huimin's business was booming, fortunately, there were no leaks. After nineteen minutes, Dongxing's Shi Dafa took a free kick 30 yards from the goal, and Wu Kaimin rushed up and scored with a touch, tying the score at 1-1. Three minutes later, left winger Jiang Xian took a corner kick, and the ball landed perfectly. Zhang Jiliang intercepted it and passed it to Yan Chengkuan, who scored with a powerful shot, reversing the score to 2-1.</p>
<p>After switching sides, Huaguang gained the advantage of playing with the wind, and the situation became more balanced. The game became more intense, with both sides having opportunities to score, creating dangerous moments. In the last ten minutes, Huaguang frequently attacked the goal, but they were too hasty. Goalkeeper Gao Weichen was skillful and did not allow any scores. As a result, the score remained 2-1, and Dongxing won. The lineups for the two teams were as follows: Dongxing</p>
<p>Gao Weichen</p>
<p>Zheng Bingyi Li Chengxian Wu Kaimin Wang Baoshan Shi Dafa Zhang Jingen Jiang Kun Chen Qin Zhang Jiliang Yan Chengkuan Zhang Jiliang Yan Chengkuan Wang Burong</p>

<h3>To Ms. Chen from Zhuji: Attention, Package of Candied Dates to be Claimed</h3>
<p>The Chauffeur from Jiaxing is Commendably Enthusiastic Editor: I am currently working as a chauffeur at a certain mansion in Jiaxing. On the 28th day of last month (December), at around 4:00 AM, I took the (102) through train from Hangzhou to Shanghai to Yuanjia. At the Hangzhou City Station, I encountered two women surnamed Chen, carrying a bag of candied dates, claiming to be from Zhuji and going to Shanghai to visit relatives. Because it was difficult to board the train, they asked me to help carry the bag onto the train. At that time, I gladly agreed because I thought it would be difficult for women to squeeze through the crowd, and I told them that my surname was Wang. When the train started moving, I searched for the two women everywhere on the train, but I couldn't find them. When the train arrived at Jiaxing Station, I got off the train and shouted along the train, but no one responded. Since I will be returning to Hangzhou soon, I will deposit the candied dates at Zhu's residence at No. 84 Qingtai Road. I am now writing to respectfully request that you publish the original letter in your newspaper and please also forward it to other newspapers in Shanghai and Hangzhou, so that the owner of the items can come and claim them. I would be extremely grateful. Respectfully wishing you peace, Reader Wang Zhaobin</p>

<h3>A Look at Central China</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Fang Canglang</p>
<p>[Report from Hankou, via airmail, 15th] From December 20th of the 37th year of the Republic to New Year's Eve, the climate in various parts of Central China has been cloudy, gloomy, and cold. As a result, people's moods have also become heavier and more melancholic. In fact, the climate here isn't exceptionally cold, and the living environment is normal, not particularly unusual. What clear-headed and discerning people consider unusual are only the following few things:</p>
<p>The People Yearn for Peace, a Universal Chorus</p>
<p>"War is like fire; if not suppressed, it will consume itself." This is a precious teaching left to us by our ancestors. The civil war has now raged for three years, causing the ruin and death of over a hundred million people. The war situation remains difficult to resolve, and the people yearn for peace. Since everyone hopes for a peaceful and stable situation, the call for peace naturally resonates everywhere. General Commander Bai, bearing the responsibility for the safety of Central China, vaguely heard that the President was about to make a new decision on the major issues of peace and war. Therefore, after assessing the overall situation and bowing to the will of the people, he submitted several valuable suggestions to the Central Government in late December. According to sources involved, Bai's suggestions coincided with the President's wishes. Thus, after the President's New Year's Day statement was issued, public opinion in Central China was unanimously supportive, without any dissent. This can be seen in the appeals for peace from people's representative bodies in Hunan and Hubei, etc. Among them, the only relatively radical and uniquely responsive person was Liu Jixue, Speaker of the Henan Provincial Assembly, who issued a telegram in his individual capacity, and a few grumbling words from some elderly people concerned about the times at a symposium calling for peace in Hubei. At the time, they seemed sensational, and after being spread by rumor-mongers, sensitive people discussed them with feigned seriousness. Many impatient people criticized the aforementioned grand old men severely. In fact, this was all unnecessary. It should be known that there is no distinction between old and young among humans who cannot bear the suffering of war. How much more so for these elders who have experienced so much hardship? They have their individual freedom of speech. They highly admire the President's revolutionary achievements and his leadership in the war of resistance, and they deeply believe that President Chiang, who is willing to accept good advice, may accept candid opinions. Indeed, not long after, the President's reply arrived, expressing his acceptance of the elders' opinions. Recently, taking advantage of Political Committee Member Zhang [blank] Ying [blank]'s visit to Hankou, he conveyed the government's painstaking efforts to seek peace and the true state of the current situation, which finally brought the peace movement in the Central China provinces to a state of mutual understanding and consensus.</p>
<p>Don't Burn Incense Before the Bodhisattva Arrives</p>
<p>Now that the atmosphere of peace in Central China has cleared, rumors in Hankou have also decreased. People's topics have shifted back to the three question marks: "peace," "war," and "retreat." This shows the general public's distress. However, from the mouths of some people coming from Nanjing, there are still quite a few comforting good news stories to be heard. What is regrettable is that 京沪报纸 (京沪报纸 refers to newspapers from Nanjing and Shanghai) has been absent for over twenty days. This absurd decision to suspend the transportation of 京沪报纸 gives rumour mongers a better opportunity. No wonder local representatives sighed when they saw reporters, saying, "In these times, it's not easy to get information. Without 京沪报纸, the market situation is naturally unclear. The silver dollar dealers on Hankou's Unified Street will naturally report inflated prices, stirring up trouble. A few people who don't understand the market situation will inevitably engage in 'burning incense before the Bodhisattva arrives' by rushing to buy silver dollars. Why won't the transportation authorities let us see Nanjing newspapers and Shanghai newspapers?"</p>
<p>Speaking of Hankou and silver dollars, it can make public education personnel shiver. The value of silver dollars in Hankou is closely and meticulously tied to commodity prices. This phenomenon has existed for a long time. Initially, it was because manufacturers had to use cash to buy cotton in the production areas, butchers had to use cash to buy pigs in the countryside, and grain merchants had to use cash to buy rice in the production areas. Silver dollars played a leading role in the market. Today, although the gold yuan (a currency) is not dead, people's hearts are dead. The power of silver dollars in the markets of Hankou and even other ports in Central China is unparalleled. All commodity prices must follow them. In the most recent month or so, the black market price of silver dollars in Hankou has risen from 20 yuan to 130 yuan per piece. As silver rises by one foot, commodity prices rise by ten. The silver dollar black market often throws the commodity price white market into chaos. Once commodity prices are pushed up by silver dollars, they cannot fall. In the past three days, Hankou's silver supply has tightened, and silver dollars have fallen back to around 110 yuan, but commodity prices have not fallen. What is most pitiful is that while all commodities are rising in price, public education is the most inexpensive. The lives of public education personnel, who are disconnected from silver dollars, are full of resentment towards silver dollars in the three towns of Wuhan and southern Henan. Especially in Hankou, "silver" is the root of all evil. In these short ten days, thanks to the efforts of the municipal authorities, hundreds of "silver dogs" have been arrested. Although silver dollars are still causing trouble, it cannot be solely blamed on the incompetence or irresponsibility of the current administrative officials. One can only curse "silver dollars should die" and loudly condemn those "scoundrels who used to love silver," to vent one's anger.</p>
<h3>War Zone Students in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Report from Nanchang, via airmail, 15th] War zone students and some faculty members are unwilling to receive poisonous education in communist-controlled areas. They voluntarily left their homes and embarked on a difficult path of escape. Their spirit of perseverance and hardship has aroused the admiration of people from all walks of life and won the sympathy of the people in the rear. Therefore, they have been constantly receiving hospitality from local people along the way of their southward migration. Jiangxi's hospitality and resettlement of transit refugee students has given them the warmth of human sympathy during their arduous journey, and further strengthened their confidence in the inevitable success of suppression and construction.</p>
<p>Unexpected Guests</p>
<p>When the first batch of refugee students from the war zone arrived at Nanchang Railway Station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, because the Ministry of Education had neither sent anyone to Jiangxi to preside over the reception in advance, nor had it sent a telegram to notify the Education Department, it was not until the students arrived at the South Station that the Education Department received a report from the station stating that a group of war zone students had arrived. They had not eaten, and they did not have extra money to open a hotel at the station to solve the problem of food and lodging for the day. Director Zhou Bangdao of the Education Department, who is known as "Old Master," was really distressed by his "poor coping" at the time, because the Education Department was so poor that it could not even afford fuel for the office stove. Where could he find extra money to deal with this matter in an emergency?</p>
<p>At that time, they gathered all of the money the staff had in their pockets for small dishes and cigarettes to make up a pitifully small sum, and quickly sent someone to the station to receive these "unexpected guests."</p>
<p>However, after the first batch of students was received, the second and third batches kept coming from the east. Then, the Education Department had no choice but to ask Director Zhou to come forward and temporarily borrow a sum of money from the Central Cooperative Treasury, the China Farmers Bank, and several other financial institutions that usually have an interest in social undertakings, as a reception fee, promising to bear the bank's interest, and repaying it within five days.</p>
<p>Reception Work</p>
<p>After obtaining this loan, the reception work was fully launched. A reception center was formally set up at the station, preparing tea, snacks, and meals. Moreover, many students who fell ill on the way were treated by specialists sent by the Health Department to set up a clinic at the station. Chairman Hu Jiafeng of the Provincial Government, Director Zhou Bangdao of the Education Department, social celebrities, and others visited the station from time to time to express their condolences.</p>
<p>The students on the refugee route deeply felt "there is also sympathy in the world" when they received such condolences and reception. Although there were occasional misunderstandings at the station due to the buying and selling of food, the local order was generally peaceful.</p>
<p>According to the Education Department, the total reception fee used to receive refugee students was 23,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Fundraising Measures</p>
<p>The source of this fund was originally planned to have two measures: (1) launch a fundraising campaign in various schools, (2) The Provincial Assembly Speaker Wang Zhenxin and Education Department Director Zhou Bangdao would write letters to major wealthy households to solicit donations. At that time, they believed that the fundraising of the second method should have good results, that is, the two gentlemen Wang and Zhou who were named went to the door to borrow money, and the rich people would also look at their faces, but the fact was completely the opposite.</p>
<p>When the students solicited donations on the streets, they encountered generous people, but they also encountered people's blank stares. With their own enthusiasm, they achieved good results - raising more than 42,000 yuan. In addition, some of the eminent officials received solicitation letters from Speaker Wang and Director Zhou. Apart from one businessman who automatically sent 1,000 yuan to the Education Department, no second person could be compared with him.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province's Key Land Administration Promotes Agricultural Land Reform</h3>
<p>[Report from Zhenjiang, 17th] In addition to continuing to carry out cadastral surveying, the focus of this year's land administration work in Jiangsu Province will be to promote agricultural land reform. According to Zhang Hui, Director of the Provincial Land Administration Bureau, "We are now collecting relevant materials and formulating simple and easy-to-implement measures, which will be submitted to the Provincial Government for approval before implementation. As for the content of the measures, the actual situation in the occupied areas, semi-controlled areas, and controlled areas will be considered separately, and progress will be set to implement the principle of 'land to the tiller' in order to stabilize the lives of farmers and enhance combat strength. However, it is not enough to solve the difficulties without revolutionary means when implementing it. Four counties in this province, Jiading, Wujiang, Changshu, and Jiangning, have been designated as pilot counties for soil reform, and the progress of the promotion in these four counties will be used as a reference for reform throughout the province."</p>
<h3>Recent State of Public Security on the Border Between Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Report from Guiyang, via airmail, 9th] Long Tengxiao's machine guns are plentiful, sophisticated, and effective, so the People's Defense Forces are naturally no match for him. The province urgently dispatched a company of the 2nd Regiment of the Provincial Security Forces stationed in Guiyang overnight, and a battalion of the 126th Division of the National Army stationed in Qidong was also sent to assist in the suppression. After about ten days of fierce fighting, both the government and the bandits suffered casualties. Xiong Qiang, the magistrate of Pu'an County, was once captured, and two battalion commanders of the security regiment were wounded. Judging from the situation, more troops will have to be added to eventually prevail, because the number of bandits has been coerced from about a thousand to five or six thousand people. Han Wenhuan, Deputy Commander of the Guizhou Provincial Security Forces, personally went into action, and sent an independent battalion to Panxian. Lu Jie, the commissioner of Xingyi, also led the People's Defense Forces and district security teams from Xingyi, Xingren, and other counties to join the battle line. After such great effort, Long Tengxiao's lair, Nuozhai, was captured on November 27. He led his remaining troops to flee to Haizi, where Panxian meets Pingyi, to continue his stubborn resistance. At present, the opium growers in the area are afraid of the government's military force and have automatically eradicated the seedlings, and public security has gradually recovered. However, it remains to be seen whether Long Tengxiao will make a comeback one day. Chairman Gu Zhenglun advocated that "the border areas are more important than the interior, and preventing bandits is more important than suppressing bandits." Therefore, the bandit suppression troops in Panxian and Pu'an have not yet been demobilized, so as to avoid the resurgence of bandits. Xiong Qiang, the magistrate of Pu'an County, was also dismissed and investigated for "improper handling."</p>
<p>At the intersection of Bijie in western Guizhou, Zhenxiong in eastern Yunnan, and Xuyong in southern Sichuan, the forests are deep and dense, and the mountains are continuous. It can be said that since the mid-Qing Dynasty to the present, the evil forces on the border of the three provinces have always ruled there. Among them, the forces of</p>
<p>Bijie Tusi (Indigenous Ruler)</p>
<p>Yang Zhizhong and Long Chengyao, a local tyrant in Zhenxiong, are the largest. The government has always adopted a policy of appeasement towards them. As long as they can look up to government personnel on the surface, they always take the attitude of "turning big things into small things, and turning small things into nothing." The people in the area have always been afraid of offending these indigenous rulers or local gentry and landlords. In the lower part of November of this year, the Yunnan Provincial Government received an order from the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, talking about Long Chengyao organizing his "Long Family Class," while persecuting Xu Shifang, Speaker of the County Council, and Li Renfu, a local squire, and at the same time, enticing Luo Renji, the county magistrate, to turn a blind eye to the prohibition, and plant a large amount of opium in the county. He also gathered bandits and gangsters to armed protect the planting. The Yunnan Province was afraid that the idlers in the area would easily be mixed in and used by the communists, so it sent Bai Tianmin, Deputy Commander of the Provincial Security Forces, along with the 126th Division of the Eastern Yunnan Garrison to clean up the countryside, and Luo Renji, the county magistrate, Xu Shifang, the speaker of the county council, and Li Renfu, the local squire were all</p>
<p>Designed to capture and kill</p>
<p>However, the bandit Long Chengyao and others still relied on special forces to escape safely. At the end of November, the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters secretly ordered the authorities of the three provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan to cooperate in arresting Long Chengyao and others for investigation. However, because Long had served as the commander of the Eastern Yunnan Command, he had special ties with the previous and subsequent chief administrators of Yunnan. The Guizhou Province also wanted to find a way to appease him, without "forcing him to join Liangshan." Therefore, in early December of last year, both Yunnan and Guizhou provinces either telegraphed the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters to revoke the arrest warrant for Long Chengyao, or took responsibility for recommending him, asking him to atone for his sins by protecting his homeland. Whether the public security in Bijie, Zhenxiong, Xuyong and other places can be temporarily stabilized recently is of course not. Moreover, the telephone lines in the neighboring counties of Pingyi, Qujing, Zhansheng, Panxian, and Pu'an are often destroyed by those bandits when they rob houses, and the highway traffic is often washed by bandits at the border entrances and exits, and it is impossible to suppress them. The key to not being able to maintain security in the border areas is that it is "using your neighbor as a drain", not to mention that it is suppressing the forces of bandits who are half civilians and half bandits?</p>
<p>The southern Sichuan counties of Junlian, Qi County, and Xuyong are closely adjacent to the two provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou. Bandits often appear in the complex terrain. Because Lu County and Yibin are Yunnan and Guizhou</p>
<p>Opium Smuggling</p>
<p>The export of the station, it is necessary to participate in the organization of the Gelaohui (Brotherhood Society) to "get things done" more easily when selling opium. It is impossible to distinguish between these people and bandits. It is no exaggeration to say that they are a "trinity." It is really not easy to completely eliminate them. Recently, Rongyu (Chengdu and Chongqing) newspapers have repeatedly reported that a large-scale Yiguandao (a syncretic sect) bandit organization was smashed in remote counties in southern Sichuan. The leaders were Chang Zhenzhong and Gao Heguang from Hebei. They entered Sichuan from Beiping and set up altars throughout Sichuan to recruit young men and women and unemployed vagrants to join the religion, and pay huge membership fees. For a time, ignorant men and women flocked to it. The religion has set up branches in various counties in southern Sichuan, and there are also specialists from Beiping coming one after another, which shows that its organization is very large. The Chongqing Pacification Headquarters has ordered the bordering areas of the three provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan to earnestly investigate and arrest them. The Guizhou Provincial Authorities have also agreed with the Sichuan Provincial Authorities to lay telephone networks on both sides of the counties bordering the two provinces in order to facilitate information, and then agree to jointly defend and suppress the roaming bandits. At present, it is reported that there are no bandits gathering to cause harm in the counties of Daozhen, Yanhe, Nanchuan, Qianjiang, Bijie, and Xuyong. The public security in rural areas is still peaceful.</p>
<p>The gentry communists in the Yunnan·Guizhou·Sichuan triangle area, such as Liu Fuchu, Zou Zhengzhong, and He Zhiping, have incited the villagers to revolt for more than ten years. Although He Zhengping has been executed in Kunming, Liu Fuchu and Zou Zhengzhong are still lurking and inciting in this area. It is hoped that the public security authorities in the province will "be prepared for danger in times of peace" and pay attention to it as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Management of British State-Owned Enterprises (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ben Geng</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our London Correspondent, 4th] Since the Labour Party came to power in 1945, major enterprises that have been nationalized, aside from the steel industry which is still undergoing legislative procedures in Parliament, include the Bank of England, civil aviation, coal, electricity, gas, raw cotton (centralized purchasing), and transportation. In addition, the British Broadcasting Corporation (British Broadcasting Corporation) has been transformed into a public management entity since January 1927, but the third license, which came into effect in January 1947, also differs slightly from previous ones.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to provide a brief introduction to the management methods of various state-owned enterprises in the United Kingdom. It focuses on the issues and then explains them according to the circumstances of each enterprise.</p>
<p>Starting with the Core Organization</p>
<p>The core organization for the management of various enterprises has different names. Some are called "Corporation," such as broadcasting and civil aviation; some are called "Authority" or "Board," such as electricity and coal; some are called "Commission" or "Council," such as raw cotton, transportation, and gas; and some are called "Court," such as the Bank of England. Although the names of these institutions are not consistent, they generally adopt a committee system. The number of members varies, from seven in the Broadcasting Corporation (including one chairman and one vice-chairman) to eighteen in the Bank of England (including one governor and one deputy governor). Except for the members of the Broadcasting Corporation, who are appointed by the Privy Council, and the Bank of England, who are appointed by the King, the members of the remaining institutions are appointed by the minister in charge. Current members of the House of Commons are not allowed to serve as members of the aforementioned state-owned enterprises. In addition, generally, those who have other professions and whose professional interests are incompatible with a certain state-owned enterprise cannot serve as members of that state-owned enterprise. As for the active qualifications, some enterprises have no restrictions, such as broadcasting, banking, and civil aviation. Most of the others stipulate that those who have knowledge or experience in the relevant business of the respective enterprises. As for the term of office, some have a fixed term, such as the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Bank of England being five years, and the members being four years. Some stipulate that it cannot exceed a certain number of years, such as the Broadcasting Corporation not exceeding five years. Some stipulate the time limit at the time of appointment, such as transportation. Some stipulate that the government minister in charge will specify it, such as coal, electricity, and raw cotton. As for the point of dismissal, some stipulate that they can be dismissed without conditions, such as the Broadcasting Corporation, which can be dismissed by the Privy Council. Some stipulate that if the minister in charge believes that someone is unsuitable, he can declare the position vacant, such as coal and electricity. Some stipulate that the minister in charge can declare the position vacant under certain circumstances, such as civil aviation. Some have no regulations, such as transportation. In terms of salary, the Chairman of the Broadcasting Corporation receives an annual salary of £3,000, the Vice-Chairman £1,000, and the members £600. The Governor of the Bank of England receives an annual salary of £2,000, the Deputy Governor £1,500, and the members £500. The treatment of members of other enterprises is determined by the minister in charge with the consent of the Treasury.</p>
<p>The core organization mentioned above can also be said to be</p>
<p>The Highest Organization of Each Enterprise</p>
<p>In addition to this highest organization, some enterprises also have regional organizations or advisory organizations, which will also be briefly described here.</p>
<p>The so-called regional organization means that some enterprises are in fact distributed throughout the country, so there is naturally a need for "Area Boards". Such regional organizations are found in legal provisions, such as electricity and gas. In the case of electricity, the country is divided into fourteen regions, each with a management organization, which adopts a committee system and is appointed by the minister in charge after consulting the highest organization of electricity. In addition to the chairman, the number of people is five to seven. The gas industry divides the country into twelve regions, also adopting a committee system, with the same number of people as electricity, and appointed by the minister in charge from qualified people stipulated by law. As for the relationship between the regional organization and the core organization, it has a somewhat hierarchical nature. In other words, the scope of activities of the regional organization is not only limited to specific regions, but in fact, it is subject to the guidance and supervision of the core organization, and certain powers are exclusively reserved for the core organization. Another type of organization, which is somewhat similar to regional organizations but is actually different, is the division of the transportation enterprise into five "Executives". In addition to the core organization, the transportation enterprise is divided into five executive departments: "Railways", "Docks and Inland Waterways", "Road Transport", "London Transport" and "Hotels". It also adopts a committee system, with four to eight members in addition to the chairman, who are appointed by the minister in charge from qualified people after consulting the highest transportation organization. The power of this executive agency is entrusted by the highest agency with the consent of the minister in charge.</p>
<p>In addition to the above organization, there is another</p>
<p>Advisory Body</p>
<p>For example, the broadcasting programs of the Broadcasting Corporation are divided into several regions, so there are several "Regional Advisory Councils", and other advisory committees can be established if necessary. The candidates for the Regional Advisory Committee are those who can represent the people of the region. Coal has two consumer committees, one is the "Industrial Coal Consumers' Council" and the other is the "Domestic Coal Consumers' Council", both of which are established by region and appointed by the minister in charge after consulting with interested parties. Its task is to discuss matters related to the supply and demand of coal, and then use it as a reference for the competent authority. Civil aviation has an "Air Transport Advisory Council", in addition to the chairman who must be a qualified lawyer, there are two to four other members, at least one of whom has air transport experience and one of whom has other transport experience. There are now three civil aviation companies in the United Kingdom, each of which must have such a committee. Each district in the electricity sector has a "Consultative Council", with 20 to 30 people, of which 1/2 to 3/5 must be representatives of the local area, and the rest are representatives of various consumers related to electricity. The situation of gas is roughly the same. Transportation has two institutions, one is the advisory committee and the other is the Transport Tribunal. The former is of an advisory or liaison nature, while the latter is an institution for reviewing the nature of transportation costs. The candidates are all related to consumers.</p>
<p>The above is about the organization, and the following will briefly discuss the supervisory methods of the competent department for various state-owned enterprises. Regarding</p>
<p>Supervisory Methods for State-Owned Enterprises</p>
<p>In addition to the appointment and dismissal of personnel, which is actually an indirect supervisory method, in terms of substantive matters, it can be roughly divided into several points: First, in principle, the minister in charge generally retains the power to issue orders to guide the relevant state-owned enterprises. However, the legal provisions for various state-owned enterprises are not exactly the same. Some regulations are concrete, such as broadcasting, the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications may notify the Broadcasting Corporation to stop broadcasting certain programs, and at the same time, when the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications deems it necessary, he may directly use the broadcasting station. Some regulations are more abstract, such as the Bank of England, which stipulates that the Treasury, after consultation with the Governor of the Bank, may issue guidance that it considers to be related to the public interest. Some also stipulate that certain matters must be approved by the minister in charge, such as coal. In addition to similar regulations as the Bank of England, it also stipulates that any reorganization or development related to capital expenditure must be approved by the minister at any time. Second, in terms of finance, borrowing is usually limited, such as the Broadcasting Corporation can only borrow £1 million, and coal can borrow £10 million, but except for acting according to its own power, it must have the permission of the minister. There are a total of three civil aviation companies, each with a different amount that can be borrowed, but it also requires the permission of the Treasury. Other industries such as electricity, gas, and transportation are also generally restricted. At the same time, the accounts are also often subject to some kind of supervision. For example, the annual accounts of the Broadcasting Corporation must be submitted to the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications and must be audited by a registered accountant approved by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. Coal, civil aviation, electricity, gas, raw cotton, and transportation are also audited by accountants approved by the competent department. Third, annual reports, the Broadcasting Corporation, coal, civil aviation, electricity, gas, raw cotton, and transportation must submit annual reports every year. And transferred to Congress by the minister in charge.</p>
<p>What is described above is the general situation. Except for the Broadcasting Corporation, which is a "licensed company", the rest are</p>
<p>Commonly known as state-owned enterprises. The Broadcasting Corporation began in 1927, and the rest were nationalized after the Labour Party came to power. Generally speaking, the management of state-owned enterprises in the United Kingdom currently has several characteristics: First, although the organizations of these state-owned enterprises are slightly independent, they are different from general government administrative agencies. However, they cannot be compared with general private companies. The organizations of these state-owned enterprises are mostly subject to quite strict supervision and guidance from the competent department. Second, within the organization, the committee system is generally adopted, and a position such as a chairman is also established. Most of the candidates for the committee have some experience in the industry, in order to collect opinions and benefit widely. At the same time, members of the House of Commons are restricted from holding concurrent positions, so as not to have too close a relationship with politics. Third, these enterprises mostly have advisory bodies. The purpose of these bodies is generally not technical but social. It is hoped that the enterprise organization and the enterprise users can have a chance to cooperate in the right way. Strictly speaking, these methods are all in a process of trial and error. The effect will depend on the proof of future facts.</p>
