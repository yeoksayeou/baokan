<h3>渤海灣葫蘆島港內　叛艦重慶號被炸燬　一部份官兵已遵勸登陸</h3>
<p>〔本報青島十九日電〕七千噸海軍叛艦重慶號艦，氣絕南返後，今日由空軍B24型機前往實施轟炸。據初步報告，該艦業已在渤海灣葫蘆島港內，被炸中巨彈二枚，而受初步創傷。截至發電時止，空軍巨型機仍在第二軍區陳嘉尚司令親自臨空指揮下，續予轟炸中。</p>
<p>〔本報青島十九日電〕中國海軍艦重慶號，距其二月廿六日叛變出走廿天後，在中共區海港葫蘆島，被中國空軍派機轟炸，使之受傷頗重。該艦出走廿天中，其流亡海上生活頗為凄苦，晨初二天，海總上海港口電臺，尚以為其在赴臺航程中，與風濤搏鬥，自第三天起，卽發東煙臺港，投稿中共之懷抱。當重慶號由海總發現其失蹤後，海總當局深知此事內幕嚴重，但不敢完全判定其竟不顧一切投共，及至空軍偵察機之長腳，於三月三日，初次在煙臺港發現重慶號龐大艦身後，始完全確定此艦之下落，於是軍方卽着手研究處置，并卽以電波與重慶號艦上電臺通絡。重慶號亦深知天空掠過機影，倘不虛與蛇委，不免有立卽遭禍之結局，故亦不時發出偽報，謂艦上意旨紛歧，容稍待時日，或可南歸，如此拖延，直至三月十日。當時海總一面與該艦通報，一面自三月三日起，卽派出海澄號砲艇，前往廟島海峽南端長山島一帶佈防，以監視此渤海出入口海域。另派運輸艦，載警衛營士兵，於三月十四日前往蓬萊縣劉家溝登陸，以便自地面進入煙臺，并對重慶號九日尚泊煙臺，十日卽不見其蹤跡。此營長旋在蓬萊境內，訪中共區人民，方知該艦一部黃縣龍口藉水兵廿餘人，於煙臺登陸後，卽退伍返鄉，中共曾發動鄉人，為之掛紅慶賀；同時得知由於中共對該艦不全信任，曾令該艦一部官兵登陸，另易一部精銳共軍官兵登艦，執行協助。中共亦深知該艦停泊煙臺危險甚大，如欲立時使用該艦南下，與海軍其餘軍艦火拼，一方面在情緒上為不可能，一方面中共軍略家及艦上官員，亦曾告以空軍鐵翼之可畏。倘若歸入蘇聯控制下之旅順港，自可逃避被炸之危險，但蘇聯卽被牽入一國際交涉事件中。最後無奈，祗得北航，於廟島海島極北端海面，折西轉入渤海，再北行駛赴遼東灣之葫蘆島港內。當重慶號如此凄苦的北航，終於達到此一避難港後，艦上官兵已因缺重油，缺淡水，缺統一意志之不快，而被折磨得完全消失了離滬出走時的叛氣。彼等在葫蘆島作各項補充，精神體力略作恢復，下一目標何處，彼等實無法知悉，而此際空軍之長腳，終於重又跨到。空軍再度得悉重慶號在煙臺失蹤之三月十四日，立卽派出偵察機，分路在海洋上搜索，其中一架載了海總徐參謀，沿膠東半島海岸至煙臺，在煙臺曾發現商輪三艘，又飛長山島。另一架甚至在遼東半島海岸線，直溯至鴨綠江上。另一路則在渤海灣內。三機經二天偵察，十五日終於被一架C—47機在葫蘆島港內發現。海總經最速之考慮，立卽委請空軍，予以處置。自十五日起，此艘巡海艦卽由空軍派機先予監視，十八日開始對該艦轟炸。由於該艦官兵總　　數約有七百名，空軍先勸令彼等登陸，其中一部遵勸登陸，一部則由共軍協同，以艦上廿四門高射砲及防空機槍，對空搏鬥。十八日之轟炸，僅有一枚千磅巨彈，命中該艦尾桅部份，使該艦起濃煙，發巨火。十九日空軍第二次往炸，卽有三枚巨彈擊中艦上之甲板，終於炸毀艦上蓄油艙。據最後歸航之P—38型機報告，該艦業已陷入全艦大火狀態。空軍為執行轟炸該艦任務，毛瀛初署長曾飛青島親自佈署指揮，第二軍區司令陳嘉尚，則親駕C—59型在葫蘆島上空指揮，B—24型機則由候傑副大隊長領隊。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕十五日被空軍在連雲港炸創甚重之黃安號叛艦，今日續有空軍派出飛機前往轟炸，業將該艦全部炸毀，艦身沉沒海中四分之三，水面僅餘艦首一小部。</p>
<h3>代總統協助組閣　日昨來滬分訪各方勸駕　並商討經濟改革諸問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕代總統因協助組閣工作，特於十八日赴滬一行，以延攬新閣人選，同時商討經濟改革問題，頃以任務告成，於十九日下午五時許乘天雄號專機自滬返抵京。按組閣之責任，應屬何氏，但何氏經數日來之困難遭遇，已有難產現象，何氏並坦白向代總統說明其困難情形，代總統經考慮後，卽於十八日下午四時半與何氏通電話，決定親自赴滬，以為何氏之協助。惟代總統對滬行任務，拒對記者說明。十九日下午五時廿三分專機大雄號抵京時，正風雨湍急之際，記者於其下機後，詢以邀請新閣人選時，據答「組閣是行政院長的事」。記者詢及滬行任務時，代總統僅稱「遊玩遊玩」。旋卽乘車返傳厚崗官邸。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕新閣難產聲中，李代總統突於前晚自京悄然抵滬，以私人身份與各方接洽，從旁協助何應欽組閣。代總統已於昨日午後四時十分自滬搭天雄號專機飛返首都，留滬期內，流動緊張，曾先後與薛篤弼·梅貽琦·胡適·劉攻蕓·襲學遂·張嘉璇·陳光甫·張君勱等交換意見，截至渠離滬時為止，各方之反響如下：薛篤弼氏雖經李氏一再敦勸，但對副院長之職，迄尚在謙辭中。梅貽琦亦堅不肯就教長之職，翁文灝·胡適力勸無效，梅氏且擬於日內赴穗一行。張君勱昨日亦曾訪晤李代總統，洽商民社黨入閣問題，惟據可靠方面透露，張氏個人對入閣事堅決反對，不但不擬負責實際部會，卽政務委員亦認為無擔任必要，該黨內部對入閣事意見極不一致，亦有力主參與者，但不得張氏同意，不致發生個別行動。青年黨各首領在滬與李代總統無接觸，但截至目前為止，青年黨對入閣問題，至少在表面仍堅持其十八日宣言之態度。在協助何應欽組閣之外，李氏來滬之另一任務，為與此間金融界領袖洽商改革財政經濟問題，代總統於昨日上午親訪張嘉璇陳光甫於寓邸，密談三小時左右。據有關方面透露，張陳均無意參與實際政治，故談話全為研究問題性質，新閣中財政金融之最高負責人均將蟬聯，以保持政策之一貫性。</p>
<p>李代總統抵滬後至為忙碌，前晚曾與薛篤弼·梅貽琦·胡適接觸，勸請薛·梅兩氏參加新閣。昨晨九時許，李氏先赴薄石路訪問張嘉璇，繼往福開森路晤陳光甫，談話達三小時。據張嘉璇氏表示：李代總統亟欲明瞭本地之經濟情勢。目前經濟上之最大問題，仍為財政支出過鉅，欲言改進，當仍在新閣成立之後。午後一時起，李代總統分別接見劉攻蕓·冀學遂·張君勱，有所商談。四時十分，李代總統偕翁文灝·劉攻蕓·程思遠等同搭天雄號專機返京。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕杭立武昨日午後一時曾謁李代總統，有所接洽。有關方面透露：新閣閣員之特色，以內政外交教育三部最感困難，迄未有所決定。而內中尤以教育一部因經費支絀，問題複雜。更乏理想人選充任，故如梅貽琦吳貽芳等堅辭不就，杭立武亦為可能之人選。</p>
<p>〔聯合社廣州十九日電〕消息靈通人士今日稱：新任行政院長何應欽，已電請吳鐵城蟬聯副院長一幟。</p>
<h3>內長人選費躊躇　新閣新人新攻恐難實現</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕何內閣之人選，經李代總統之協助，十九日晚已有進展，惟原定十九日晚可以決定之全部名單，尚未揭曉。何氏十九日晚六時曾首先邀請自滬歸來之翁文灝及張治中·邵力子·吳忠信·黃少谷等會談，由翁就滬行洽談經過予以報告，並續就人選部署，詳為研究·至八時半，代總統並親赴鬥雞閘參加會談，至下午九時許始離去。茲悉：新閣名單中最為困難之人選，實為內長，因最初係屬意於為官清廉，現在滬執行律務之薛篤弼，以薛不允，復有邀李漢魂之說，惟旋更以已決定為秘書長之黃少谷改為內長，但十九日再度變更，仍由黃任秘書長，內長一職，則敦勸薛篤弼以副院長兼任，惟目前尚未獲得薛之首肯。其次經長則已大致決定為孫越崎，外長預為傳秉常，交長續懇虛作孚出任，國防由何兼，教長杭立武已大致可能。據最後消息，如薛氏堅決不允，則副院長將邀賈景德出任，內長可能為李漢魂。另悉徐堪十九日曾致函何氏辭財長職，如此閣員名單又缺一人。又此項名單，如能在日內決定，在黨務上言，凡屬國民黨員，將提出中常會中政會之通過，在行政手續上言，則將由院長送總統提名故公佈期尚需待一二日後。至目前止，大部份人均以極大之忍耐，聽候新閣之佳音，但不斷遭遇到之謝絕消息，使一般人均恐新閣難的新人。新政之表現。</p>

<h3>郭德潔自桂抵京　沙田柚分享記者</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕代總統夫人郭德潔，十九日下午三時自桂乘專機飛抵京。郭於濠雨中下機，往迎者甚眾，惟郭因在人帬中覓其元首夫君而不得，經記者告以尚未返，始恍然，而詢以渠赴何地，記者告以一小時後始將自滬歸來，夫人始欣然登車而去。又夫人專機載廣西沙田柚多筐，記者帬會當塲分享兩枚。</p>
<h3>李代總統　電召西北大員　來京商討國是　　余漢謀薛岳由穗飛京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕李代總統頃分別電召西北軍政大員來京，商討國是，計召見各員有鮑爾漢·馬步芳·馬鴻達·郭寄嶠·董釗等員，短期內可抵京。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十九日電〕據悉：余漢謀·薛岳定廿日飛京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕李代總統十九日晚七時在總統府邀宴抵京軍政大員陳誠·朱紹良·王陵基·楊森等，並由顧祝同·周至柔·桂永清·李漢魂·劉健帬·黃少谷等作陪。</p>
<h3>提高銀元拋價事　監院派三委澈查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕監院十九日上午大會中，若干監委見報載中央銀行將銀元提高至七千元一枚拋出，領導金鈔及物價上漲，咸表憤慨，已力主予以澈查，監委胡文日暉·李夢彪·劉行之·馬空帬·廬鳳閣·陳大榕·格桑悅希等七人當提出臨時緊急動議稱：「查本日報載，國家銀行於十八日決議提高金銀價格，致物價猛漲，其用意何在，應迅派員向財部查詢，並予緊急糾正，是否可行，敬請公決」。當經于院長提付討論，胡文暉就提案略作說明後，全塲卽無異議通過，並推定胡文暉，唐鴻烈，何濟周等訪委員進行澈查。三氏已定廿日訪財長徐堪及國行總裁劉攻蕓·查詢真相。</p>
<h3>預南鄂東重要橋頭堡　國軍決全力確保　張軫司令官離漢返信陽</h3>
<p>〔本報信陽十九日電〕軍息，由皖北經正陽閣·三河尖西推之共軍原屬劉伯誠部之兩個兵團，大部已到達豫南商城·固始，與沿新潢公路南下之陳賡兵團在淮河南岸會合。據悉：截至十八日止，集結豫鄂皖邊區共軍總兵力在十五萬以上，其已侵入鄂東蔴城一帶共軍，則不足二萬。淮河北岸共軍主力幾已全部南下，僅留置若干土地共，以資牽制。據某軍權威人士谈：共軍此際集中大軍於上述地區，其企圖甚明，若謂此隅共軍卽可憑藉其優勢兵力直趨耶東江岸，在薪春·浠水·武穴·田家鎮間選擇其攻擊重點，以便渡江，似覺過早。但所予平漢沿線曁漢口側背之威脅，殊不容忽視。就渠觀察，軍方對豫南·鄂東各重要橋頭堡，必能以全力確保，而蔴城·禮山之收復，亦指顧間事。</p>
<p>〔本報信陽十九日電〕豫主席兼第五綏區司令官張軫，十九日午由漢返此，旋在綏區部召集各將領舉行會議，並作重要指示。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十九日電〕張軫十九日晨七時返信陽，張氏此次來漢，曾數度晉謁白總司令，有所報告，聞白氏對豫南情勢及今後發展曾有全盤指示。</p>
<h3>當局嚴防江北共軍南渡　將設江防總指揮部　和談聲中局勢充滿再戰性</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕當局為嚴防江北共軍南渡，近據增設江防總指揮部，統率江南海·陸·空三軍，以加強原有指揮機構，該項機構聞經最高軍事當局核準後，卽可付諸實施。又國防部十九日晨九時舉行高級軍事會報，到桂永清·周至柔·郭懴·林蔚·候騰等十餘人，由參謀總長顧祝同主持，除報告防務，聽取敵情報告等外，對如何防止江北共軍渡江，討論尤詳。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京十九日電〕中國政府區域內之政治氣氛，現似戰爭甚於和平，憂慮前途之潛流，開始集結於熱心與中共政治解決之表層下，雖則官方預料和談不久卽將開始，及官方直言對和平前途抱樂觀。有資格之觀察家認為，目前局勢充滿爆發可能性。和談諒將開始，但可能在任何時間決裂，而戰爭可能重起。此外，如李代總統與何院長不能壓倒反對派力量，政府中內部政治爭執將加深，日益惡劣之財政情形可能更為惡化。</p>
<p>現有徵象顯示在開始中之緊張情緒正掠過平靜表面。最近返京之昔撤退者，傳又在準備行裝，有資格之觀察家認為，緊張情緒之復然，主因在於林彪部隊之南下。在中國人士眼光中，林彪部隊較其他中共部隊具有更大重要性。</p>
<p>此等最近車事發展，以及關於中共管理北平之消息，傳已使對和平絕對樂觀者甚至亦懷疑和平解決之可能與否。據某一不願姓名被公布之立委稱：林彪部隊之南下以及中共在北平之行政，已削弱政府內主和者之聲勢，而助長主載者之呼聲。另一亦不願姓名公布之立委預料，和談之時間表如下：和談在兩週內開始，進行兩週，然後決裂。渠認為，屢獲戰果之中共，大約不願討價還價，僅討價而問是或否之答復。</p>
<h3>蘇北江岸附近狹長區　共軍正加緊調動　江陰方面國軍派艦巡弋</h3>
<p>〔本報武進十九日電〕蘇北共軍配合其全面戰略與政略之運用，在距江岸五十華里至一百華里以內之狹長地區中，加緊其調動工作，目前除前傳在運河線上之兩廣縱隊，第十三縱隊兩部及在泰興東北地區之第九縱隊尚未能確切證明其存在外，揚州迄南通一線，計有六個縱隊，分別布置於揚泰·海泰·口泰·通榆等四線之上。口泰線上為第四縱隊，該部之第十一師附兩泰獨立團，十九日午後南進至口岸國軍陣地當面，其先頭部隊約千餘人，并已抵達極近江岸之第一線陣地，口岸以西之三江營附近，亦竄到共軍一部約三千餘人。揚泰線上泰縣·仙女廟之間，十五日開到新近調來之第一縱隊，自口泰線折向東南，在泰興·靖江一線上，係自揚州東調之第十縱隊，泰縣以東之姜堰鎮，為原駐黃橋·靖江間之長江縱隊第一〇一，一〇二，一〇三等三個團，姜堰迤東迄海安附近，為第十縱隊。第十一縱隊則仍駐於如皋及其以南地區，如皋以南之南通，仍為長江縱隊之第一〇四，一〇五，一〇六等三個團。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江十九日電〕省保安部十九日發表一週共軍動態：（一）十一縱隊十二縱隊已迫至靖江以北江邊六圩鎮公所橋一帶，其餘無顯著變化。（二）淮陰新增到第三縱隊（洪澤區西岸調來）。（三）共軍現在各地積極訓練操舟技術，並將輜重儘量向沿江地區移動。</p>
<p>〔本報江陰十九日電〕靖南十圩共軍已增兵力，目的在攫取八圩港橋頭堡，軍方已增派軍艦來澄巡弋。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江十九日電〕施家橋當面十九日晨曾有小接觸，來犯共軍於戰鬥半小時卽退去。</p>

<p>孔子云：「德之流行，速於置郵而傳命。」根據增韻的解釋，「馬傳曰置，步傳曰郵」，這是古代輸送官書的兩種方法，相等於現在的郵遞。取譬必須通俗，可見在當時一般人心目中，郵遞一定是極其迅速的。否則，孔子便不至於舉此為例了。洎乎近世，裁驛歸郵，從御用的官驛到民用的郵局，轄疇愈廣，處事愈繁，以言迅速，固已倍蓗於曩時，以言困難，實亦遠駕乎往昔。蓋郵政之對象旣變，其所負之使命，亦不得不因此改易，因此加重，這是十分明顯的。為了適應此一使命，服務目標，遂亦有所廣益，廣益者何？日：中國幅昌廣大，人口稠繁，郵政旣以民衆為服務對象，窮鄕僻壤，必求滲達，不能不於「迅速」之外，更求「普遍」，此其一。官書專用的時代旣已過去，郵政需求日多，財力有限，輸送收寄，間亦借手於人，不能不於「普遍」之中，力策「安全」，此其一。「衙鬥」習氣，久被詬病，「銅欄杆的冷面孔」，亦曾傳為話柄，處此人民世紀，舊觀念亟應淘汰，郵政旣以老百姓為發展事業之對象，尤須率先倡導，尊軍民意，處處為公衆着想。力有未足，補之以心。以和露，週到，不倦的「服務精神」，養成社會良好的風氣，此其三。今日郵政所標榜的目標，曰迅速，日普遍，日安全，曰服務。五十三年來痛苦困難的經騐，就結成了這一點認識。</p>
<p>兩三年來郵政革新措施，已在耳目，茲不復贅。去年迄今，凡所興舉，例如加强航空寄遞，改進鄉村郵政，推行報值掛號，設立疏遷公衆通訊服務站，恢復國共兩區通郵等，亦莫不循此目標，努力為之、雖然環境變易，阻礙加多，然而有一分力，做一分事，有一點火，發一點光，「種瓜得爪」，效與却還是有的。縱觀這一點效果，加以分析，我們覺得有四種因素，可以臚陳：</p>
<p>一曰，輿論之鼓勵與公衆之愛護。一年以來，輿論之鼓勵郵政，督促郵政，或見之社評，或形諸專文，表揭褒貶，報不絕書，登載郵政問答，刊佈郵政消息，多方匡協，培此嫩芽。至於公衆對郵政之建議，在郵局徵詢函答復表中，尤見踴躍。接受輿論與摒絕言路，為萬百事成敗之關鍵。今日郵政之新措施，很多出自公衆建議，街談足採，况乃公臣。猛晋力行，此其明鑑。</p>
<p>二曰，交通部門之協助。運輸為郵政之命脈，由於先天的缺點，郵局對於交通工具，無力廣自置備，空運如航機，陸運如火車，公路汽車，水運如輪船，民船，均不能不仰仗於旣成的機構。幾年以來，交通機構對於郵件的迅速輸遞，加意愛護，在郵政志願完成迅速。普遍·安全和服務的任務上，佔有不可麼滅之勞續。中國的社會向來缺乏合作精神，故交通機構賜予郵政的合作和協助，尤使人有湛深的印象。</p>
<p>三日，郵政制度之優良·郵政制度之優良，亦為今日郵政稍具成効的基本條件之一。如所週知，郵政為一具有國際性的中立機構，而所以保持此一傳統，則由於其制度之嚴密與完備。郵政有完美的人事制度，有謹嚴的視察制度，有縝密的會計制度。錄用必經考試，升遷必符定規，動惰有賞罰，老病有撫卹，人盡其才，物盡其用。在郵政事務的處理上，只有制度，沒有人情；只有事業，沒有個人。郵政人員之所以能安心服務、實繇於此種保障。瞻顧今朝，緬懷往昔，郵政先進之刻苦釐訂，辛勤維護，實在不容抹煞。</p>
<p>四曰，郵政員工之努力。最後，我們還得一提郵政員工的努力。事業之骨幹繫於制度，而事業之血肉則充自人力。郵政員工，錄用必經考試，知識技能，駕乎水準。兩三年來，配合新設施之推行，羣策羣力，必期有成，大體上尙能明瞭其時代之使命，以及對終身職業所應負的資任。「非以役人，乃役於人」，這是今天郵政員工那務的信價。</p>
<p>在社會轉形期中，郵政，這一個具有國際性的中立機構，亦面臨到五十三年來最大的困難。我們相信，以與論和老百姓對郵政的愛護，以交通機構對郵政的協助，以及郵政本身的堅忍不拔服務公衆的精神，必將排除萬難，重登坦途。</p>

<p>政治革新綱要內容</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕經立院研究起草之政治革新綱要，十九日下午在立委座談會席上復被立委大事抨擊，若干委員認為，綱要內容旣太複雜，漏洞亦多，且與憲法中之規定重覆，無異廢話，此種集體唱和，不如再下工夫訂一方案，要政府切實執行。原起草人則辯為該綱要係根據各委員所發表之意見起草者，如有不妥，仍可加以修改，當決定廿一日再開小組審查會。十九日立委座談會最初係討論廿日立·監委聯席談話會之內容，因若干立委主張應在談話會中討論政治改革，故涉及政治改革綱要初稿。關於談話會內容，發言者雖多，但未獲結論，僅決定談話會推于右任主席。茲誌立院政治改革綱要初稿如次：（一）行政院應為名實相符之責任內閣，對立法院切實負責，所有政策與重要措施，必須送經立法院議決後執行。（二）中央與地方行政機關及國營事業機關，應本嚴格緊縮之旨，統籌裁併，各機關權責務使分明，辦事程序與手續力求簡化。（三）力矯中央集權之弊，切實實行均權制度，地方政府在其權限內之措施，中央不得干預。中央業務之在地方者，應儘可能委託地方政府辦理。中央與地方財政收支糸統，應予嚴格合理劃分。省（市）縣（市）及蒙藏地方自治，應迅速實行。（四）國防部編制應予緊縮，聯勤總部應予裁併，國軍數額應予裁减，軍佐及勤務人員應减至最小限度，嚴實發放軍餉，嚴格整頓軍風紀，革新人事制度，統一軍令。（五）實行志願兵之募集，以補徵兵制之不足，兵役法中規定緩微緩召辦法，不公平之處，應卽予修改，微兵所發生之流弊，應嚴加糾正。（六）征借征購一律停止，田賦征實得視各地情形改為按值折征金圓券或銀幣。（七）嚴厲執行財產稅之征收，淸查豪門及官僚資本，予以凍結，並按其非法所得情節之輕重，予以部份或全部沒收。（八）中央銀行應直隸財政部，中國·交通·中農三行，中信·儲匯二局，及中央合作金庫，應按其業務性質，予以裁併，主持人員應澈底更換，庫存應切實淸查，發行及業務嚴加管理與監督，商業行莊嚴加取締。（九）士兵及文武公敎人員待遇應予合理調整，務使其家庭生活得有保障，國營事業從業人員之待遇不得特殊優越。（十）實行文武分治，現役軍人不得兼任文官，人事制度應依法切實推行，各機關用人不得私相援引。（十一）妥籌失業失學之扶濟及流亡學生之安嚴，（十二）積極推行土地改革，迅速達到耕者有其田之目的，並視土壤氣候之宜，分區　　推行糧食及棉花增產。（十三）疏通運輸促進國內各地物資之交流，鼓勵並合理指導輸出入貿易。</p>

<p>〔本報重慶十九日電〕張羣談：行政院會議已通過各部會將派代表一人駐渝聯絡。</p>

<h3>漢口漸成一死城　戰時創痍未復市面蕭條　江濱大廈日漸倒圮不勝今昔之感</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社漢口十九日電〕漢口前為華中工商業之中心，今漸成一死城，抗戰時受日軍佔領之摧殘，美飛機之轟炸，繼受通貨膨眼之打擊，復因外船之停駛，內戰之進行，致一百三十萬居民之城市，今僅成一行政地區，而市面日見蕭條，漢陽鋼廠今已不復存在，該廠經日軍劫掠，甚至將廠屋拆毀，用其磚石，今已成一片瓦礫，熔鋼爐則仍餘殘骸，今日所謂工業者，惟存紗廠四家。一九四四年美國超級空中堡壘曾炸毀該港之一切設備工廠倉庫等，致前德租界與日租界之全部幾成平地，前英租界亦大受損毀，經此破壞，復因禁止外船駛至此間，漢口航業已减少四分之三，一九三六年外船出入本港者，共八百四十萬噸，華船共七百三十萬噸，一九四六年海洋船舶之出入者僅二萬二千噸，江輪則為二百萬噸，共軍之威脅，使船上更形淸寂，因中國航業公司寗願將船停泊上海，而不願駛至上游有為政府軍徵用之虞。戰前漢口共有外僑二千餘人，今僅餘五十人左右，現尙有棉油·烟草農業產品之洋行數家，維持小寫字間，而大部份皆已停閉，由代表看管行中產業，以待國共和談之吿成，彼等希望漢口仍有一日得在中國復興事業中佔一位置，漢口江濱今已成為荒凉之道，道旁矗立巨大廢棄之建築，及焚餘銀行與倉庫等之殘骸日漸倒圯。無人思及加以修理，漢口向有「東方芝加哥」之稱，回思往日之繁榮，實令人不勝感慨。</p>

<p>〔合眾社莫斯科十九日電〕蘇聯官方報紙消息報之國際問題評述員十九日稱，大西洋公約為「反對和平之侵略性陰謀」。渠稱此種陰謀「在大西洋公約中表示最為明白」。消息報之反應與塔斯社之華盛頓訊相類似。塔斯社該訊稱，「一般估定大西洋公約為英美統治圈侵略政策之主要工具，此點於外交部在一月二十九日發表聲明以後卽已顯然，公約原文之公佈完全證實此種評估。該公約之起稿人引用虛偽句子，偽稱彼等為和平奮鬥而效忠於聯合國憲章，實圖遮掩大西洋公約明顯之侵略性質，該公約同時直接危害聯合國。公約原文證明該公約具有軍事及政治性質，規定簽約國聯合軍事力量以採取聯合軍事行動，并規定因此而設立適當之軍事機構。尤可值得指出者，該公約規定幾國軍事義務，此等義務係在區域性協定之範圍以外，強調其不符聯合國憲章。公約原文使人相信，其真正目的乃英美反動圈利用若干國家，作為實現彼等侵略目的跳板及軍事基地」。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十九日電〕蘇聯各報今日以一欄半之地位刊載英美等多國下月在巴黎籌開「世界和平大會」之消息，而對大西洋公約則僅刊載塔斯社拍自華盛頓之一簡短電訊，計僅卅六行。各報謂巴黎之和平大會，顯示蘇聯及各地進步民族之和平志向。</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦十八日電〕北大西洋公約之公佈，預示東西外交戰最危險之一面正開始，此時期中無疑蘇聯除武力外，將運用各種方法答覆。西方外交家預言稱，伸入每一歐洲國之共黨政治機構，將鼓動罷工，政治示威，甚至可能引起暴動，此種「第五縱隊」活動將不足激起使用大西洋公約中之互助條款。按照公約，大西洋國家對此種打擊性的戰術，將不予以協商應付，除非此種活動足以威脅國家安全之時。故蘇聯可無須担心其立即的後果，勢將繼續加強其以前素着運用之戰術。蘇聯與英法兩國訂有戰後合作條約，有效期為二十年，保證東半球之盟國為和平工作。蘇聯業已指責英法違反此項條約，可能進一步宣佈廢棄此約，但此行動祇有在心理上起作用，因此種條約早已不能實行。法外長許曼稱，大西洋聯盟并不影響法蘇條約之有效性，同時英外部發言人對英蘇條約亦發表相似之聲明，但蘇聯將不對此有所印象。蘇聯外部於一月廿九日稱，大西洋公約將「蹂躪」蘇聯與英法之條約。西方外交家并完全接受蘇聯另一聲明稱，蘇聯必須「進行更強大之奮鬥」，但彼等不信蘇聯要戰爭</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十八日電〕今日據悉，德境蘇軍司令索柯洛夫斯基已離此返國，出席莫斯科軍事會議，該項會議殆與北大西洋條約有關。</p>
<h3>艾契遜向全國廣播　闡述美和平目標　聲明西方聯盟符合聯合國憲章</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十八日電〕國務卿艾契遜今夜向全國發表廣播演說，說明建議中之北大西洋公約之特點，聲稱其最重要之目的，即為「和平與安全」。艾契遜核要敘述建議中之公約來源，規定與目的。渠謂，「美國政府以及與吾人共同參與此項公約之政府，深信此項公約係屬一項必要之措置，其目的乃在增強聯合國，制止侵略，以及造成安全感。後者對於世界之恢復經濟政治健全，係屬必要者。」</p>
<p>艾契遜說明此項公約在擬具之時，曾如何努力設法法使之與聯合團組織確切相符。渠力言締約各國抱定宗旨，俾依照聯合國之原則與目的予以履行。渠於追溯公約之來源時，曾指示蘇聯在聯合國內所採取之阻撓策略，後者曾妨礙聯合國維護和平與完全之努力，渠并謂，美國政策「于形成之時，係具有確定之目的者，此即藉和平方法以疏通目前國際間所發生之重大異見是也。」艾契遜并批出歷史對於自由國家所作之昭示，此即欲求獲得真正之和平，各國不儘應不斷為此一目的努力，并須明白表示「武裝進攻將遭遇迅速而有效之集體防禦行動。」</p>
<h3>蕭翁評公約　僅係一張廢紙</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十九日電〕蕭伯納今晨告法國新聞社稱，大西洋公約又不過是一張廢紙而已，又稱，余可奉告者僅此而已。</p>
<h3>華萊士指摘　謂將導入戰爭</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十九日電〕進步黨領袖華萊士十八日夜在此間稱，大西洋公約係罪惡昭彰之違反聯合國憲章行動。又稱該公約係使世界分裂成兩個不能和解之集團。華萊士呼籲美人不能為其中之和平主義者之飾詞所影響，此僅為直接走向戰爭之掩護行動而已。</p>
<h3>西歐國家一致擁護</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十八日電〕西歐各國今日一致擁護北大西洋聯防條約，認係阻遏戰爭與共產主義之最佳防綫，并對美國上司促成該約備加贊揚。共產黨方面則大聲疾呼，指斥簽約為「戰爭販子」。據英外部發言人稱，參加簽約國至少有美加挪英法比荷盧八國。此舉將使二億五千萬人民團結一起，并代表全世界大部份工業資源。因時，英外相貝文在下院宣稱，「北大西洋條約已創造一個合作與諒解之新時代，凡無侵略略野心各國毋須恐懼不安」。西歐各國政府領袖亦羣起響應。法外長許曼在巴黎記者招待會稱，「北大西洋條約供給法國以抵抗侵略之有力保障。」比總理史巴克在白魯塞爾稱，「該約乃歷史上一大事，足以減少戰爭之可能性。」荷外長史蒂克在海牙告記者稱，「此約在目前世界之地位極端重要。」加拿大總理勞倫特亦稱，加拿大人民必可全體擁護該約。另據挪京報告，挪威國會料將在本週內准許入盟事宜。</p>
<h3>美將實施新軍事租借法　西歐北美重整武裝　大西洋公約可望國會迅速批準</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十九日電〕此間消息靈通方面稱：美國政府願於大西洋公約批準後之十二個月內，以價值三十至五十億元之武器及軍事配備，供給在歐洲之大西洋公約參加國。新的軍事租借方案將為大西洋公約機構中重要的一部。大陸軍事專家認為西歐武器，遠遜蘇聯及其衛星團，蘇聯如果發動攻勢，西歐殊無抵抗之能力。人人均知除非西歐及北美重整武裝，則大西洋公約殊無實際意義可言。</p>
<p>大西洋公約真正的考驗，當於各參加國開會討論彙集武器及軍隊之時始發生。在該一階段，將面臨兩個切實的問題，即（一）西歐是否將供給大部份步兵；（二）大西洋公約諸國所草之防禦計劃，是否將以阻止蘇軍於萊茵河東為主要目標。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十九日電〕參院外委會領袖十九日期待杜魯門總統要求及早准許大西洋公約的緊急籲請。委員會主席康納利稱，渠相信杜魯門將在四月四日參與國簽訂該約以後，立即將之提交參院。康氏已通知各委員準備對此一問題加速行動。據悉，杜魯門將基於其外交助理人員之忠告，要求參院及早准許該約，蓋渠等認為蘇聯及西方世界間的緊張局面必將高漲，直至該約正式生効之時。按大西洋公約使西方八民主國家在二十年相互防衛協議下，聯合一致，其他歐洲國家如義大利丹麥冰島及葡萄牙等國，亦可望在該約正式簽訂之前加入該約。國會領袖在一般上均認為該約對蘇聯及其衛星軒，係一種必要的警告，使彼等在發動對西歐的侵略之前有所顧慮，而最好三思而行。但若干參議員則關切建議中的軍火計劃，參院軍備委會主席麥凱勒及該會共和黨籍主要委員勃里奇均稱，渠等希望在准許該約之前，獲悉此項計劃的費用。參議員楊氏則稱，以軍火供給西歐國家的計劃，并不十分樂觀，渠担心美國運往國餐之軍備最後將落入任何共產黨侵略者之手。參議員麥克卡倫稱，渠認為在準備不可避免的對蘇戰爭中，該約為必須之防衛措施。渠稱，「可我確信，如一旦蘇聯能製造原子彈，戰爭即將爆發」。</p>
<h3>願致力於經濟復興　法蘭西需要和平　許曼稱參加公約在確保安全</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十九日電〕法國防部長賴瑪迪今日廣播稱，法國需要和平，法國衷心嚮往和平。因如無和平，即不能有自由與民主。賴瑪迪在指出外間攻擊法國侵略係一對法一种污辱宣傳後稱，超過兩百萬軍隊并將其軍隊集中邊境者，決非法國。</p>
<p>反之，法國卻集中全力於經濟復興，及毫不躊躇減少其軍隊。渠又稱，侵略戰爭·防止侵略戰爭，皆非法國人民·法國議會·及法國政府所欲，法國將忠守凱洛格白里安非戰公約，拒絕將戰爭作為國策之工具。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十八日電〕法外長許曼今日在記者招待會上稱，大西洋公約簽訂後，其簽定國當然將增加軍火之生產，由於國際軍之尚付缺如及受否決權之鉗制，聯合國決議等於具文。大西洋公約并不與聯合國憲章違悖，反之，且配合聯合國制度。許氏特別指出西方盟國信任戰時之共同勝利及友誼，已將軍隊復員，裁判武備，而蘇聯及其附庸國則不但保持軍備實力，且未減少其武裝部隊。蘇聯的擴張，已不以斯拉夫土地為限。法國由於其地理地位，殊不容其不信已能免除發生衝突的威脅。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾赴美</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕邱吉爾今日登「伊麗莎白皇后」號郵船赴紐約時，成千觀眾向彼歡呼。邱氏在美國作演講旅行，并定於四月十二日返英。</p>
<h3>英關切希土伊獨立完整　支援地中海聯盟　蘇報抨擊美在伊朗野心</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕外相貝文在下院中強調聲明對於希土伊朗等國獨立與完整的關切，使人相信英國將積極支援地中海公約之締結，以配合大西洋公約。外交界人士認貝文之作此語，事先必會縝密考慮，乃英政府重大的外交決策聲明。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十八日電〕莫斯科「勞工報」今日發表社評稱，美國使伊朗淪為其殖民地的計劃，目的在準備新戰爭。伊朗之七年計劃，不過為英美帝國主義奴役伊朗計劃的一環。伊朗反動派利用二月四日對伊王挑撥性的抨擊，竟對反對英美統治伊朗者發動恐怖行動。伊朗七年計劃固係由美專家六人帮同草成云。</p>
<h3>日國會行揭幕式　共黨議員三十餘人拒絕出席　裕仁照例宣讀簡短詔書</h3>
<p>〔合眾社東京十九日電〕日本眾議院共黨籍議員三十五人，因日皇裕仁出席主持第五十屆國會的揭幕式，十九日全體拒絕出席。依照傳統，日皇雖已在新憲法下被好剝奪政治特權，但仍對兩院聯席會議宣讀一簡短之詔書，籲請國會議員合作，使日本成為和平的民主國家，俾能再度返回國際家庭。</p>
<p>日共領袖德田，野孤志賀及其他共黨議員八人，均未到達國會大廈，其餘二十四人雖在國會大廈內出現，但并未參加開幕式。蓋日共反對保留天皇制度，即使天皇已被剝奪政治特權。在佔領之初，日共曾要求以高級戰犯審判日皇裕仁。裕仁稱：渠能看到日本人民的生活水準的提高，深感快慰，渠將此歸功於盟國的援助及日本人民不顧艱難的努力。但渠警告稱：日本人民決不能中止此種努力，而必須繼續奮鬥，正確地了解民主原則，并重建自給自足之經濟。渠強調稱：日本必須在「精神上及物質上」與世界并駕齊驅。本屆日本國會，正面臨許多嚴重問題，特別是如何執行麥帥的九點經濟穩定計劃，如何平衡預算。雖然，吉田的極端保守內閣在國會中擁有絕對多數，但由於日共議席的激增，渠等顯將極盡全力，使內閣陷於困境。</p>
<h3>吉田將訪道奇　商預算問題</h3>
<p>國會施政演說延至廿六日</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十九日電〕關於預算問題，麥帥總部之意見與民自黨之諾言始終處於對立情勢，　相池田往返磁商，迄無圖滿結果，終至必須作政治性的解決。據池田氏語記者，首相吉田雖在病中，現已決定親自出馬與麥帥總部經濟顧問道奇公使作政治性的協商，以謀預算問題之接近。</p>
<p>〔又電〕內閣書記長增田十九日通知眾參兩院議長，以首相之施政方針演說，由於預算編製之遲延，擬延慢至廿六日發表。</p>
<h3>美決不容許日本　為共產主義犧牲</h3>
<p>麥帥顧問塞巴特演說</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十九日電〕麥帥政治顧問塞巴特，今日在此間聖保羅大學演說，略謂美國決不容許日本為共產主義煽惑之犧牲者。最近法國，義大利，英國與挪威共黨揚言反對參加反蘇戰爭，此輩實為國族與家庭之叛逆。反共不僅須加緊警衛，且須在各方面推廣民主措施。</p>
<h3>印巴不擬參加　太平洋公約</h3>
<p>〔中央社新德里十九日電〕此間當局人士暗示，印度將不加入太平洋公約。澳大利亞對太平洋公約之聲明大致僅反映出澳洲之初步意見。消息靈通人士相信，印度及巴勒斯坦，均不擬在太平洋担任軍事任務。據悉，印度頗有意在印度洋另起爐灶。</p>
<h3>大西洋公約　聯防區範圍</h3>
<p>包括人口三億五千萬　土地八百六十萬方哩</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十八日電〕據國務院當局解釋，北大西洋聯防條約之重心為「武裝攻擊」一條，計包含下列四種情事：（一）攻擊任何一簽約國領土，北非洲法屬地阿爾熱利亞亦在內；（二）攻擊美英法在西德或奥國境內之佔領軍；（三）攻擊簽約國在北大西洋之屬島；（四）攻擊簽約國在北大西洋方面之艦船或飛機。此外，北大西洋盟約所包括之土地計約八百六十萬方哩，人口約三億五千萬名。鐵幕後面之土地約共八百九十萬方哩，人口約共二億九千五百萬名。</p>
<h3>大部日人意見</h3>
<p>大西洋公約將引起戰爭　因蘇聯將參加軍備競賽</p>
<p>〔合眾社東京十九日〕日本報紙十九日以最大的篇幅刋載大西洋公約內容。許多日本人仕認為，大西洋公約將引起第三次世界大戰，蓋蘇聯必將解釋為侵略性的公約，而參加軍備競賽。盟總高級官員私人表示對公約條款的滿意，但稱：「現在，吾人需要太平洋公約。」</p>
<h3>日官方表示應推及遠東</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十九日〕日本官方及民間對於北大西洋盟約之談判成功，均表示感激。內閣書記官長增田稱，尚望美國促進和平與安寧，不以北大西洋為限，并當推及遠東及將來。眾完議長幣原稱：此盟約絶佳，無人能反對。參院議長松平稱：此約為維護世界和平之正當路綫。共黨領袖野田則稱，此約似為反共產措施，共黨現尚不準備發表正式意見。</p>
<h3>東西集團　實力比較</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十八日電〕已加入及將加入大西洋公約的之十二國，其聯合的人力與資源，已超過蘇聯及其衛星國。西方國家之實力，計（一）人力超過蘇聯系約百分之十五。（二）鋼鐵生產能力超過蘇聯係國家三倍餘。（三）煤產超過蘇聯系國家二倍餘。（四）油產超過蘇聯系國家八倍，而拉丁美洲中東及遠東所產尚不計在內。（五）海洋船舶噸位超過蘇聯系國家三十四倍。（六）卡車公共汽車及小汽車，多於蘇聯系國家近三十倍。就武裝部隊數量言，蘇聯集團超過西方集團百分之廿五，但求準確起見，應按已配備訓練及準備作戰之師團逐一比較，此等數字則屬軍事秘密，非外界所能知。前項資源之估計，未將原子彈，美國最新式之B三六型轟炸機，及集於大西洋中美國現役軍艦七百卅一艘計算在內。</p>
<h3>以色列要求英國　撤離外約但駐軍</h3>
<p>以黎即將簽訂停戰協定</p>
<p>〔路透社台拉維夫十八日電〕以色列外交部發言人稱：在羅特島與外約但舉行休戰協定談判之以色列代表，業已要求完全撤退或大量減少英國駐在外約但之軍隊。除非英軍撤退，以色列將堅決要求減少駐在外約但之英軍，俾與羅特島談判議定之裁軍額相符合。以色列發言人并指英軍之駐在外約但，妨礙以色列外約但談判之進行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅特島十九日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦調解員彭契今日宣稱：以色列與黎巴嫩兩國料將在一二日內簽訂停戰協定。</p>
<p>〔路透社海爾辛基十九日電〕芬蘭已於昨日在法律上承認以色列國。</p>
<h3>巡視中東駐軍　史林元帥返英</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕英帝國參謀總長史林元帥，巡視中東及地中海各地英駐軍畢，今日返抵倫敦。史氏出巡期間曾至特里埃斯特·雅典·塞浦魯斯·蘇彞士運河區·的黎波里·及馬爾太各地。據談各處英軍紀律嚴明，訓練嫻熟，士氣殊為旺盛。</p>
<h3>聯合國軍官二人　在棉蘭受傷</h3>
<p>〔路透社吧城十九日電〕聯合國軍事觀察員英人卻浦林中校及美人薛蒙斯少校，昨在蘇門答臘島棉蘭以南八十哩處受傷，各中六彈及一彈。聯合國方面已派軍事觀察員五人飛棉蘭調查。此乃聯合國人員在印尼之第一次被傷。荷軍報告謂，兩人係於敵方行動時受傷。</p>
<h3>緬空軍轟炸瓦城</h3>
<p>〔聯合社仰光十一日電〕政府今日宣佈，緬甸空軍昨日首次轟炸瓦城叛軍陣地，叛軍紛紛逃入佛寺躲避，防空部隊則開高射砲抵抗。</p>
<h3>柏林蘇區實行　自警團制度</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十九日電〕柏林蘇軍佔領區共產黨現已實行民眾自警團制度。該項制度與日本及德國戰時所施者頗多相似之處。由共產黨指派自警團員約二萬八千人在街頭担任守衛，賦有較小職權，如向每戶分發配糧劵之類</p>
<h3>美海軍裝備優越　可應付任何事變　海軍參謀長鄧斐爾宣佈</h3>
<p>〔聯合社加里福尼亞州桑斐那狄拿十八日電〕海軍參謀長鄧斐爾今日稱，美國艦隊正準備應付任何事變。余以為美國武裝部隊，尤其是海軍，無論在天空，水面或水底均保持優越性，裝載原子彈之機羣自航空母艦出發，試驗極為成功。目前海軍特別側重建造潛水艇及防備敵方潛水艇戰略。</p>

<h3>市長倦勤辭意異常堅決　陳良任市府秘書長　明與沈宗濓行交接儀式　交際科長辭職照準民政局長亦請辭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市府秘書長沈宗濂，因體弱不宜過分疲勞，日前向吳市長提請辭職。茲據確息：業經市長於昨日批準。遺缺由陳良繼任。陳良為浙江仙居人，曾任中央軍校辦公廳主任，抗戰時任軍需署署長，嗣調任聯勤副總局司令，現任糧食部交長。又悉：市府新舊秘書長交接儀式，定明日上午舉行。後日起沈秘書長卽將在家休養，渠昨告記者，將停止一切活動，亦不擬離滬。又市府交際科長張彼德，昨向吳市長提辭呈，亦經批準。遺缺由該科秘書劉班業升任。至張氏原任之市府參事及機要室主任職仍擔任。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕自吳市長表示渠將堅決求去後，市府各局長亦紛紛表示倦勤。繼社會局長吳開先，公用局長趙曾珏，警察局長俞叔平等辭職之後，工務局長趙祖康，衛生局長張維等，均曾向吳市長提出辭呈。據悉：民政局長張曉崧，昨日亦已向市長提請辭職，惟尚未經吳氏批準。</p>
<p>據悉：此番吳市長之辭意，極為堅決，已非任何人事所能挽回。促使渠辭職之因素固多，而由於病體關係，亦屬事實。吳氏得緬甸熱月餘，迄未根治，每日手足常發冷，且易疲倦。醫師均囑其不宜再過度操勞。</p>
<p>吳氏於總統發表元旦文告之際，曾建議總統，目前時局應採軍政統一制，並堅請辭去市長之職，惟示經總統允準。其後孫內閣主政，渠又曾屢次堅辭，終因無適當繼任人選而拖延至今。惟此次辭職，吳氏業經表示，非達到目的不可。吳市長之辭意旣如是堅定，眾信或　將成為事實。市長批準趙局長曾珏辭職在先，昨又批準沈秘書長宗濂及張科長彼德之辭呈在後，卽屬明顯徵象。蓋渠等均屬市長之左右手也，</p>
<h3>南北是否通航　尚待請示新閣　輪聯及輪業公會　歡宴北上四代表</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國輪船業聯合會及本市輪船業公會，為歡迎此次北上商談華北通航問題四代表返滬，並公宴招商局新任總經理胡時淵，副總經理黃慕宗，董事長徐學禹，特於昨晚七時在招商局六樓舉行宴會。出席本市一百三十五家民營輪船公司百人。首由臺安公司董事長徐恩曾致詞，對四代表不辭勞瘁，北上商談，並能對通航問題獲致初步協議，表示敬佩與欣慰。斷由魏文瀚，周啓新，俞惠芳，姜克尼，及胡時淵等分別報告。最後，徐恩曾代表全體輪船業，為對上海實業公司派大上海輪擔任載送代表致謝，卽席贈該公司「通航前驅」錦旗一面。末放映船業電影後散會。</p>
<p>記者於會後曾就南北通航開始實施日期就詢四代表，據稱：一俟新閣組成，渠等擬卽攜同商討協議之各項報告，晉京請求，如奉核準，當可詳細內容公佈，並卽決定正式實施日期。</p>

<h3>滬津無線電話　用戶擁擠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕繼國共區通郵通航後，本市與天津間無線電話亦已恢復，用戶鑒於電話便捷，都有偏好，試話之日，電訊局長途臺於一小時中接得用戶詢問或掛號電話九十六次，估計如量接受掛號，每天可有四五千號之多。但目前通話一天最十二三次，僅及以前十分之一，因天津方面機件欠靈或管理不善所致。北平電話需要量近日銳減，每日亦可通話十餘次。至於通話內容因雙方政域不同，用戶咸特別謹慎，無非問候報安等家常話，偶而亦有商情交換，亦屬絕對少數，因本市與華北尚未恢復貿易，固毋需交換商情也。</p>
<p>又上海電信局頃接奉交通部電今稱：卽日起，凡目前尚未通報及通話之共區城市，在雙方通話及通話技術問題解決後，應先行呈報當局，由當局核準，始可進行通報通話。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市畫壇界，原定昨下午為范雪君舉行之彈詞皇后加冕典禮，臨時因鑒於事前發出參觀券過多，為恐畫迷湧到，影響秩序，特決定提前於上午十一時舉行，同時又以此次被選出之亞后徐雪月，公主張麗君，俱在外埠獻唱未能趕到，復經「加冕典禮籌備會」決定，將「加冕」改為「授冕」，由贈冕人范之寄娘丁寶英主持授典。至正式之加冕儀式，聞該會已與上海紅十字會流動診療事業委員會洽妥，擬擇日合辦一慈善園遊會，分邀本市名流參加，屆時再為范補行加冕，加冕後卽將「后冕」當塲義賣，得款撥贈紅十字會作診療經費。園遊會地點現已預定在金神父路勵志社舊址，時間將為四月上旬，正該處櫻花怒放之際。</p>
<p>昨竟日陰冷，「授冕」儀式在麗都花園偏廳簡單舉行，因臨時決定儘量秘密從事，故畫迷知悉趕往觀禮者甚少，惟畫壇各響檔潘伯英·蔣月泉·薛筱卿·范雪萍等仍準時雲集，社會局亦派有代表列席。「后冕」全部以十四K金製成，聞價値黃金兩條左右。</p>

<h3>魏德邁路命案　單身老嫗被害　埋屍地板下全身腐爛　兇手留書已逃往北平　推測動機似與桃色糾紛有關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬東魏德邁路本國街筑荘五十一號小洋房，前係敵偽產業，居有河南老嫗熊王氏，四十八歲夫已故，生有兩子，長名式芳，服務於臺灣空軍地面警衛團二團任副官職。次名元林，供職於南京某軍工兵隊為技工，兩子均未完婚，故滬寓僅氏一人。上月間熊式芳由臺致信。友人諸建華，請代照顧其母，諸獲函後卽至上述地點搜尋無着，遂亦置之。同月廿日熊元林由京返家，亦不見其母，詢諸左右隣居，皆稱昨見其外出未歸云云。躭擱一宵，仍無消息，元林乃投該管新市街警分局報告，當派員警調查無着，事後曾由該分局呈報總局備案。比至昨晨上午，諸復至筑荘能寓找尋老嫗，詎見屋已易人，內住者為空運供應隊參謀吳森林，再詢吳宅中人，仍不得要領，正猶豫間，陡見桌上有函一件，書明係致熊式芳，乃拆開細閱，始知熊母已被謀殺，屍體埋在灶間內之地板下，兇手自稱賈寶貴，函中略謂：「熊副官先生，關於你母親之死，確被我謀害，屍體放於灶披間地板下，你一看就明白，殺她的原因，是你弟弟與月霞所造成，你要報仇，可將你弟弟及月霞找到，將他們殺死，方為忠孝雙全，對不起你的人賈寶貴，現在我已赴北平」云云。全文係鉛筆所寫，審視郵戳，係於三月十一日自南京浦鎮所發。諸閱畢後，驚駭異常，卽奔赴新市街警局報告，當經陸分局長飭刑事股長劉聯芳親率巡官蘇永清，警長趙秉鉞鋮，警員朱秉鈞，羅子銓等馳赴現塲調查，經將地板掘開，現於眼簾者果赫然一屍體，身穿藍布旗袍，紥腳棉褲，遍體腐爛，細毛蒙葺，面貌已不易辯認。乃由員警將屍體運起，載送同仁輔元堂候騐，一面通緝在逃兇犯歸案究辦。推測此案動機，似與桃色糾紛有關。兇手如果已遁「解放」區，一時未易弋獲云。</p>

<h3>常州古墓　奧秘初露　專家研究墓磚　斷為三國遺物</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕常州南郊最近發現一古墓，轟動一時。記者昨特專程前往探察，並攜回掘出之墓磚一塊，經送請市立博物館主任同濟大學教授蔣大沂氏鑑定。該磚上有古錢花紋，惜因洗刷不慎已糢糊不清。據蔣氏觀察，可能是「大錢五百」四字，這是三國孫權時的貨幣。又磚上花紋，祗印於一面，而非印於四邊，亦是三國晉初所有。其後六朝之磚則面積較小，所以他斷定這古墓最可能乃是一國或三國稍後時期的遺物。古墓發現處在常州南門外一里許青龍橋附近惲家墩，其地四週一片平原，獨有惲家村旁邊卻隆起三處土墩，周圍廣大，高約數丈。墩上荒墳處處，向來被目為一堆無主的黃土。本月十日起，城坊部隊在該處構築工事，沿墩腰四週挖掘深有數尺的戰壕。十五日這一天，幾位民伕在佔地約七八畝的最大一墩靠南面一端挖掘時，忽然於泥土中發現用巨磚砌成的牆壁。當時大家不勝驚奇，在繼續挖掘之下，掘出許多磚塊後，果然露出一亦用磚砌的空形墓門。於是，這神秘的古墓乃重新出現於人間。</p>
<p>門內有門　室內有室</p>
<p>當天上午，他們把這一道墓門掘去，發現裏面是一空形的空室，約有一人一手高，六呎左右開闊，五呎左右進深。三面牆上又各有一個穹形門，均用磚塊砌塞。顯然門內有門，室內有室，這墓穴規模必非常之大。當時在這掘開的第一間室內地上，曾發現幾枚古錢及半截廢劍，可能還有幾個「俑」，可惜因附近軍民　集，這些物件在雜亂中已不知被何人所取去，卽是墓磚亦被搶搶拾一空。</p>
<p>消息傳開去之後，就有人穿　附會，說什麼墓內有珍珠寶玉哪，又有仙童仙女哪，頓時瘋魔了整個常州城的居民。從下午起，好奇的民眾，紛紛扶老攜幼，前往探看此一古跡。南門外武宜大道上肩摩踵接，惲家墩上萬頭攢動。但墓道洞門甚小，僅可容一兩人葡蔔進出，因此大多數好奇民眾祗能遙望神往，而道旁的農作物，卻被都踐踏得損壞了，真急得農家老嫗怨恨不止。</p>
<p>觀眾擁擠　妨礙發掘</p>
<p>這樣擁擠的觀眾，使發掘工作無法繼續進行。同時城防部和縣政府接到報告，以如此巨大的古墓，內中當有不少文物値得考古的研究，不應隨便任人挖掘，於是一面派武裝士兵前往監守，一面由縣府於前日召集本邑各界士紳商討後，決定組織一委員會呈報內政部批準，然後正式發掘。在施工期間，並將禁止參觀，以免妨礙工作的進行。就墓墩佔地之廣以及正式發掘所必經的手續來看，墓內秘密之揭曉，恐怕至少尚有一個月的時間。</p>
<p>目前已挖出的墓磚，每塊長一呎三吋餘，闊七吋餘，厚二吋餘，重達十八市斤。據惲家村老年村民說：洪楊時期，這三個土墩上曾為洪秀全軍隊紥營之地。又說，今年農歷正月間，駐防常州的五十二軍大兵，亦曾於無意中掘到墓磚，鄉民亦曾取得不少，當時皆未加以重視。有的拿去填鋪塲地，有的則拿去當普通磚瓦出售了。</p>
<p>地名青龍鄉　疑是帝王塚</p>
<p>有人以這古墓規模之大以及所用墓磚之厚實，認為這還可能不止是名公鉅卿之墓，甚至會是帝王之塜。更因該地地名青龍鄉，有橋青龍橋，乃益覺其可能焉「龍」地。但據蔣大沂教授說：三國期間厚葬之風普遍，當時民俗以為人死為鬼後，應該多多享受一點，墳墓無不極盡靠究。因此該墓雖大，不一定必是帝王公候，始克享此。他在蘇州亦曾發現過漢墓。又該墓所在處現名惲家墩，六朝間有楊惲其人者，為官觸怒皇上，受腰斬棄市，其族人相率逃避，遂改姓為惲。但此墓亦未必為楊氏先人之墓，蓋據史傳，楊惲當時反對厚葬最為激烈也。</p>

<h3>北平型（八）</h3>
<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>關於「局部和平」前後一個城市的報道</p>
<p>我從北平回到上海了。到了上海以後，滿目接觸的現象仍舊是鈎心鬥角，四分五裂，貪汚腐敗，自私無能！我對現政府革新的希望是非常焦急！如果政府還不能大刀闊斧，澈底改革，共產黨控制全國的可能性很大！</p>
<p>中共的成功不是偶然的。雖然人民解放軍裏的士兵，一樣的厭戰和想逃跑，解放區的人民有說不出的許多隱痛；軍事發展得太快，許多危機和矛盾也正在滋長和擴大。但是他們有許多成功因素。據筆者個人觀察，下列各點都是很顯著的優點，有助於他們革命事業的成功。</p>
<p>一·黨的組織嚴密而堅強，黨內意志是統一一體的。刻苦，服務，研究，學習，奮鬥，犧牲，是每一個共產黨的信條。雖然這其中也含有許多強制性在內，然而人是富有惰性的動物，沒有集團的磨練，是不容易成為一個堅定而前進的分子。黨是決策機關，設計，指導，監督，並不負執行的任務，執政的人多數不是黨員。</p>
<p>二·政府是具有強烈的控制力，澈底執行黨的決議。注意多數人的利益，打擊少數分子。政府基層組織深入到廣大的農村，確實能將農村控制起來。各級幹部是經過選拔出來的，具有謙和，服務，刻苦努力的精神，官僚作風及貪汚行為是不能存在的。</p>
<p>三·軍隊裏沒有缺額，嚴格而優良的紀律是勝利的絕大保證！士兵的待遇並不好，每人每月僅合三千餘元北海　，卽以十比一的比例計算，等於三百多元金元券。主食是窩窩頭或小米，副食費也不算多。但是他們的紀律很好！他們官兵之間是不存在形式主義的，士兵見了官長沒有禮節的規定，大家隨隨便便坐在一塊開會，討論，撩天。打破形式主義是消滅官僚作風的基本工作。每次戰役之前後，均經常開會討論檢討，充分發揮自動，主動的精神，三個臭皮匠勝過一個過諸葛亮，是他們尊重士兵意見的要訣。</p>
<p>四·不承認錯誤是最愚蠢的舉動，坦白，自我檢討，以及相互批評，才是進步的動力。中共黨員和幹部間，是經常保持這種精神與事實的。謙和，學習是事業成功的基本條件，中共對這兩點也特別重視。</p>
<p>五·科學而嚴密的特務工作，是中共強化政治力量的主要工具，他們非常重視這項工作，辦得非常的好！如長春的解放是馬小姐的第一功，吳化文在濟南叛變，也是這種工作的效果。類似的事實是舉不勝舉！僅管中共如何反對國民黨的特務工作，然而他們本身不僅沒有放棄，而且是在加強這一工作，不過他們的特務工作是完全以政治利害做指導原則的。絕不像那些保護私人利益，為非作歹的特務分子。</p>
<p>總之，中共確有許多優點和成功的因素，絕不是偶然的，此處也不必詳細的敘述了。將來局勢的發展，是看對手方的強弱如何來決定的。</p>
<p>筆者認為今日的問題，不是在和談的成就如何？也不是中共的優劣如何？而是在政府本身是不是有辦法？能不能澈底改革？中共的幹部也公開承認，這半年來軍事局勢迅速的發展，在他們也很驚奇！這不是中共有了不起的本領，只怪國民黨本身太腐敗無能。</p>
<p>今日國民黨和政府如果想要挽回危局，必須反求諸已，大澈大悟，澈底改革。這種改革絕不僅是人事上的變動，公文書上的紙面改革，（如所謂高唱限田政策，而官僚政治的本質並不變。）或外援的多少可以生效的。必須從制度上，作風上，幹部上，紀綱上作根本而澈底的有效改革；並且精誠團結，加緊努力，然後才可以有希望。至於那種枝枝節節，形式上的改變，不僅沒有好處，反而可以發生債事的反作用。</p>
<p>我離開了北平，回到上海。在這舉國望和平，和談正在積極進行當中，我忙裏抽霞，將北平的情形和北平型的和平，向讀者們介紹出來，雖則內容不很詳細，然而不能算是一件毫無意義的事。我希望政府當局能有澈底的有效改革，我希望努力和平的人士能為國珍重，我更希望全國的真正永久的和平能早日實現，則小民拜福不淺了！（三月十二日於上海）</p>
<h3>國內公路橋樑翹楚　寶鷄渭河大橋趕建</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州十四日航訊〕川陝交通自重慶經過廣元。漢中·雙石舖以達寶鷄，完全利用公路，由寶鷄到西安一段，除了鐵路之外，還有一段公路輔行。抗戰以前，西北物資的輸入輸出，都由京·滬沿隴海鐵路運到西安後，再靠公路分運各省。抗戰時節，隴海鐵路中斷，京·滬淪陷，國都遷往山城重慶，西北物資的運輸，只有靠川陝公路了。</p>
<p>渭河從寶鷄城南流過，抗戰以前，都以木船濟渡，不但費時，而且費事。廿六年修成了第一座木橋，有六十五孔，四百五十公尺長，只能容一輛車經過，人們都稱它為「老橋」。抗戰時軍運頻繁，第二座木橋，也應運於廿八年在「老橋」下游建立起來，那橋的橋身一〇三孔，共長五百六十公尺半，人們都稱它為「軍橋」。這兩座木橋隨着歲月的增加，日漸腐朽，每到雨季水漲的時候，常常被部份冲毀，隨毀隨修，勉強的負担着艱鉅的使命。</p>
<p>造橋計劃開展</p>
<p>廿八年時，交通部便有在寶鷄渭河上建立永久時橋樑的計劃，終因國家財政困難，擱置起來，前年八月十二日。「軍橋」北端被冲毀一大段，同時其他部份也因木料腐朽，不堪載重，該橋卽予作廢；那時跨越渭河的交通綫，只有靠建立十年的超齡「老橋」了，但它實在難以勝任，所以千孔百痍，時有阻斷。交通部第七區公路工程局於萬難中計劃興建一座鋼筋混凝土橋，去年中樞因鑒「老橋」一且中斷，而平漢·隴海兩鐵路仍無法通車的時候，西北與西南·東南的交通，勢必迂緩，甚至斷絕，乃決定另行建築新橋。</p>
<p>新橋七十二孔</p>
<p>新橋為一純鋼筋混凝土結構，共長五百七十六公尺，全橋分為七十二孔，每孔八公尺，用排　支承，橋面雙車可以併行，車道寬六公尺，兩側另設人行道，各寬一公尺。整個設計為連續托樑平板式，每隔四孔為一組，留伸縮縫一道，全橋十八組，托樑下邊為拋物綫形。</p>
<p>橋樑以及其他任何工程設計的原則，必求其安全·適用·經濟·美麗，寶鷄渭河新橋的設計，也循求這個原則，它的載重量為連續不斷之十五公噸貨車。渭河河槽闊平，河底沙礫層薄厚不可預測，所以橋基工程，自以用洋灰椿最為經濟，更由於連續托樑的設計，不但節省材料，而且外觀上成一整體，富於簡單的綫條美，給人以堅勁的印象。</p>
<p>加築防護工程</p>
<p>渭河河牀平闊，主流時南時北，遷徙不定，枯水時期，只有兩三泓小水，都超不出幾十公尺。但水漲起來，卻有四五百公尺寬，近幾年來，北岸有冲蝕的迹象，南岸則比較堅固，橋堍均用鋼筋混凝土八字禦土牆，並以水泥桶裝石頭向兩翼沿長，另在兩岸的上游加築防護工程，以求河岸的鞏固。</p>
<p>橋端接綫處路寬十七公尺半，各用曲度極緩的灣道連到原有的路基。路中心闢有兩公尺半寬的草地作為來往車流的分界，草地上預備栽培些花卉，另在南邊路旁構築兩個公園，等將來草長花香，綠樹成蔭的時候，不但增加旅客們憑窗閑眺的興緻，而且給喧囂枯燥的寶鷄，添加了一個遊憇地。</p>
<p>正式興建過程</p>
<p>寶鷄渭河大橋的正式興建，是去年十月間開始的。早在去年三月間，七區公路局卽採辦運儲材料，並成立橋工所，開始鑄椿的工程，四月下旬共軍竄擾寶鷄，雖只有幾天，但秩序未能卽時恢復，致工程停頓了幾個月。建橋主要材料如洋灰五千桶，鋼筋四百噸，都必需從重慶購了運來，在這事變期間，運輸工作自然也被滯阻。原來打算在雨季以前完成的，深水部份打椿工作，也不能按照原訂計劃進行。去年九月間，吳華甫氏接長七區公路局，為謀迅速完成這一座關係重要的偉大工程，乃成立工程處，於去年十月間正式開始工作。</p>
<p>下月即可通車</p>
<p>十月下旬，開始鑄築橋面混凝土，今年元月初，因天氣太冷，不得不將鑄築工作暫停進行，不過其他不受天氣影響的工作，仍繼續進行。二月份以後，關中天氣轉暖，恢復了鑄灰工作，在全體員工夜以繼日的努力下，橋面工程已完成百分之八十以上，橋端接綫路基及防護工程，正在積極趕做，如無意外，下月中旬可以正式通車。</p>
<p>工程遲緩原因</p>
<p>在時局動逿，物價飛漲的情勢下，築橋工程所遭遇的難題，接踵而來：第一是寶鷄地方小，發包工程不得不徴求審計機關的同意後，隨時採取各營造廠投標的方式，以與施工程序向配合。第二是技術員工的不易招致，旣不能由遠方招僱，就地訓練也頗費時日，但終於在一面訓練，一面施工的原則下，使監工的人不敢有絲毫的疏忽。木工尤其缺乏，卽使把當地全部木工都僱來，也不敷分配。再加上各地都在趕築國防工事，給予工程的阻力也不小。前兩天正在趕工時，當地軍警檢查身份證，這一批批流動而無身份證的工人，被扣押了很多。原定本月完工，也不得不加以延長了。</p>
<p>建築大橋最主要的工具，是打椿機，以求得穩固的基礎，但西北偏偏找不到打椿機，於是七區公路局自己設計了一種打椿機，利用汽車的發動機帶一轉筒吊起兩噸重的椿錘，上升到規定的高度時，錘卽脫離吊鈎，飛速的向椿上打下去，頗具效用。這樣的打椿機共製造兩部加入工作。其他水泥，木料，鋼絲，鉛絲，洋釘等材料，除了木料還需零星搜購外，無一不仰給於重慶。</p>
<p>全部工料估計</p>
<p>說起工程費來，開始時撥到法幣二十億元，購備主要材料，在幣制日益貶值的當兒，中樞核准的工程費，往往與工程的需要發生脫節現象。去年九月間，七區公路局因鑒於時機緊急，必須繼續趕工完成，一面隨時照物價波動的情形，編呈預算，一面把其他次要工程的工款，東拼西湊，集中力量來進行，才算能順利的施工到現在，一直沒有中輟。</p>
<p>總計寶鷄渭河大橋工程從開辦到完成，共花掉工程費約一千多萬金圓，如果把全部工料照目前的市價折合起來，應為十四億金圓，或銀幣七十萬元。</p>
<p>這座貫通了西北五省和西南三省到中原的大路，其直接或間接的是不可想像的。目前戰禍到處瀰漫，而西北卻致力於偉大工程的建設這一點說起來，已值得我們興奮了。</p>

<h3>申報披露二女孩失踪後　丹陽站迅即尋獲昨專送低滬</h3>
<p>收養者堅不受酬兩家願結為義親</p>
<p>本市友寗製藥廠職員王龍雲君之夫人，月前自鎮江攜二女孩搭車來滬，前後共　丹陽讀者孫·鍾·等二君函告，謂該二孩現在丹陽，惟確切地址尚待查訪等語。本欄接獲該項通知函後，正將飛電丹陽站查詢，王君亦已接本市北站警務處司法科錢科長電告：謂該二孩業已到申，當時王君正向廠方籌借五萬元，擬赴丹陽尋找，接電後欣喜若狂，急驅車赴北站警務處，二女見父，亦喜悅萬分，此次一家團員，得敘天倫之樂。</p>
<p>緣該二女孩自當日與母親失散後，卽由車上茶役陪送下車，其中大小二孩分由丹陽站伕役萬敖順徐百順二君留養家中，已近匝月，自本報刊出招尋消息後，萬徐二君始悉二孩係王君所有，當由二君夫人親自護送來申，並有丹陽站便衣警趙文翰隨行照料。王君父女團聚後，萬徐二君夫人表示願收二女為寄女，藉作萍水相逢之紀念，當由王君接受美意，臨別王君堅欲二夫人及趙君收受酬金，均婉謝，結果僅受川資三萬元，欣然道別。本報社會服務科此次略盡棉力，居然獲得迅速確實之效果，誠非始料所及。嗣後更當努力為社會服務，以盡報人之天職。（圖為王君夫人與二女在本館屋頂所攝之影，王夫人來時揮淚稱謝，益見其失孩後內心之辛酸也。）</p>

<h3>中央銀行劉總裁表示　鈔荒下週即可解除　昨央行對同業存款仍發銀元二成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行總裁劉攻芸，昨下午四時十分，隨李代總統乘「追雲」號專機飛京。劉氏行前語記者：目前之現鈔荒，下週一必可解決。至如何解決，劉氏以急於上機，並未說明。</p>
<p>後據國行某機要人員語記者，現鈔荒之形成，因上週間適值發薪時期，同時國庫又有大筆軍餉撥款，各地貼現率又均高於上海。茲者發薪時期已過，軍餉亦已陸續支撥竣事，各地貼現率，以現鈔不斷外運，已告逐漸平抑，大部現鈔，最後仍將回流上海，同時，國行現鈔亦可陸續正常供應，有此因數，現鈔恐慌，可望自然消　。故預計自下週一起，現鈔之供需，必能納入正軌。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕現鈔恐慌，昨仍未見好轉。中央銀行業務當局，昨曾召集各商業行莊負責人談話，洽定昨日國行對同業概發銀元，按隔日存款餘額，發百分之二十。作價每銀元仍為七千元，目的在透過各行莊，向市塲供應銀元。昨日估計共發銀元約二十萬枚，仍係各式銀元均有。若干行莊收進之銀元，並雜有西班牙銀元，日本銀元以及市面上並未流通之銀元，惟為數不多，國行允予掉換。昨日市面銀元價格，因此卽告穩定。</p>
<h3>金價轉疲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕黃金昨日市況轉疲，走勢乏勁。央行前日拋售後，昨日銀根鬆勢稍歛，暗息突升。晨初聞央行仍將繼續拋售，人心至軟。更因週六關係，多頭負息過重，脫意甚急，新空續拋，檯面了售頻繁，市勢一路軟弱。晨間因隔夜疲勢　滯，人心渙散，初開四八五·四九〇。開後空方見納，多頭扳持，市勢軟中帶平，微升至四九〇·四九三。高後散多脫手，挫至四八七·四九〇。低後散空再補，又升至四九〇·四九三。嗣後多頭拉抬，實施壓力，檯面供求尚平，業外亦無任何刺激，一路盤旋於四九〇左右。嗣後利空消息頻傳，金市人心如驚弓之鳥，更因暗息高至七五·七八〇元，檯面殺風驟起，市呈不支，行情逐步低游，見四八〇·四八三。低後各方乘廉思進，又升至四八七·四九〇。但大勢仍無好面，人心多半看疲，塲上空過於多，市勢又急遽回降，又挫至四七八·四八一。近午多空掙扎已畢，而以四七九·四八二午收。午後週六無大量交易，但因前市挫落，仍有做開。初開下週一頭寸為五三〇五四〇。嗣後盛傳金圓幣制又有改為銀圓券之謠傳，於是人心稍振，喊價重升，終以五三七·五四〇晚收</p>
<p>美鈔晨開九七〇〇，九八〇〇。午收九六〇〇元，九六五〇元。午後開一〇六〇〇，一〇八〇〇，晚收一〇七五〇元，一〇八〇〇元。</p>
<h3>港匯放長</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕港匯昨日晨開千元四角九分，前晚收四角五分。金圓券昨晨開每千元七角二分，前收七角。港金昨晨開每港兩三〇九元，前收三〇八元五角，美金電匯昨晨開五六二四，前晚收五元二五。美金期票昨晨開五元二二，前收五元二四。美鈔昨晨開五元二一，前收五元二二。</p>
<h3>四種外幣舊債　換發美金公債</h3>
<p>立法程序完成後實行</p>
<p>政府舊發外幣債券，卽民國二十七年金公債英美金債票，民國二十九年建設金公債英美金債票，民國三十一年同盟勝利美金公債，及民國三十六年（美金）短期庫券四種債券。實際銷售，而在三十七年八月二十日尚未到期償還之本息，前於改革幣制之初，原規定按照法定匯兌率（卽美金一元比金圓四圓）換發三十七年整理（金圓）公債，幷於十月一日由經理行局開始辦理申請登記。嗣為提高債信，經修訂依照票面額改為換發三十八年整理美金公債。此項整理美金公債條例，已由財政部呈送行政院核轉立法院審議，一俟完成立法程序，奉令公布，卽可實行換發。聞此項公債與原定金圓公債不同之點，（一）債票以美金為面額，將來還本付息，付給美金。（二）此債定三十八年四月一日發行，所有舊發四種外幣債票，截至三十七年八月二十日尚未償還之本金，及截至三十八年三月卅一日止之息金，合併計算，一律以此項公債換發收回。所有上述四種舊發外幣債券持票人前已依照原定掉換三十七年整理公債辦法向各經理行局申請登記者，財政部現已電請中央銀行通告持票人，務將原所掣得之臨時收據妥為保存，以便屆時改算換領三十八年整理美金公債，一面通飭各經理行局查照。如有原發臨時收據持據人前來洽催換票，卽將上項情形詳為告知，俾得明瞭。</p>
<h3>行局繼續差出　銀根愈見鬆動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根，呈初穩後鬆之勢。晨開各業以隔日交換時光，銀根已穩中帶俏，故紛紛扳高日拆，站定於七十五元至八十元間做開。浮多更以時值週末，恐下週銀根再俏，亦多脫貨求現放拆，市塲頭寸供應，逐漸見鬆動。近午日拆已回小至六七十元間。下午聞又有若干匯款流出，而金融當局，除發出少數銀元外，並未有黃金及紗糖等物資之拋售，續呈差出之態勢，下午銀根逐愈見鬆動，日拆亦步退至五六十元間。</p>
<p>昨日國家行局庫仍差出七億九千餘萬元，大交換各行差入八億三千餘萬元，洋商各行差入三千餘萬元，小交換各行差入一億三千餘萬元。</p>
<h3>貨主高價扳售　食米漲勢熾盛　特高粳猛叩六萬大關</h3>
<p>米市漲勢依然猛烈，因值週六之故，貨主以二天拆息之緣故，扳價而售，米市塲價均升六百元，白粳早稻各以五萬五千元開出，特高粳趨近六萬大關。南市塲米價開市漲七千，收市回一千，軋升六千元，二市到貨五六一三石。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>再造高峯，因值週六，貨主扳持加二天拆息，致豆菜油再較上日升二萬元，惟市勢上落甚微，豆油收市二十一萬七千元，生菜油二十萬零七千元，生油價奇漲，吉桶生油由二十八萬，而終叩三十萬大關，狂升四萬元，豆餅漲二三千。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>市勢仍堅，緣因銀根平穩，米價激升，人心甚昂，加以週末拆息關係，貨主扳高甚力，兵船一度叩二關，老車高做二萬一千元，麩皮客銷頗暢，跟挺千餘元，大包阜豐高達萬六千四百元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>漲勢仍熾，黃豆受油餅激升影響，廠方納進不遣餘力，車豆再挺成半，創四萬六千元高峯，乍豆喊價四萬三千元，平湖杜豆猛漲二成餘，生仁供應更見稀少，續漲成餘，苞米前日上漲過鉅，昨略見緩和。</p>
<h3>市塲散步　看台客</h3>
<p>徜徉的時候　可以預言的　遠看太悲觀　洋光光會癟</p>
<p>昨天各市走勢，是徜徉狀態。是應該徜徉的時候了。</p>
<p>所謂「應該」，工商各業的處境不同，也就各有不同的「應該」。</p>
<p>廠商要靠實銷；實銷不振，雖非現時才有的事；但以現時而更覺寸步難移。</p>
<p>不僅實銷一時決無走暢希望，而且現時又多一大困難。電力費用之貴，斷非任何廠商想得出解決辦法的。</p>
<p>假使現時環境不改善，那末可以預言的，解雇問題可能不久就會跟着發生了。</p>
<p>其次論執貨人的處境，重利是當頭棒，除非自己頭寸。自己頭寸拖進的，甩出後放利息，只好說是貪眼前利益，算盤打遠些，不免要自討苦吃。</p>
<p>假使背了重利囤貨，第一要看他借債還債的本領。第二要看他囤的是什麽東西？</p>
<p>兜得轉銀根的人，就是吃進了高息，也可以按天調進扯扯平，那末貨價有五角利息的底盤托住，還不致於暗無天日。</p>
<p>但以眼前而論，也只能替別人賺利息，自己反擔着風險。</p>
<p>近年來的商品交易，雖則早已是蹴皮球性質，但多少尚有實銷做基礎。</p>
<p>現在可不同了，別說客銷有問題，連本街銷路也極少。交通費用的增漲，單幫生路缺缺。</p>
<p>所以，現在蹴的皮球，已經等於是洋泡泡了，洋泡泡不穿也會洩氣的。實銷停滯之日，就是洩氣之時。那末，洋泡泡初時果能愈拋愈高，不久則會愈拋愈低癟的。</p>
<p>最後來論放債人的處境，靠着五角日拆的底盤，似乎多少拿穩補償。但廠商處境如彼，持貨人處境若此。除非沒有新頭寸加入，那末尚可在一般人的借債還債中討生存。可是這個前提，絕對不可能。所以今日的黑市息果然高出五角日拆之上；但可是有一天，黑市息跌在官息之下的。</p>
<p>現時，能以支撐市面的，恐怕只有金鈔銀元三根棟樑。這二天，米市的風雨，雖已不出吾人所料而降臨的，但也不是沒有飽和點的。</p>
<p>綜合上述種種，股市也不易起色了。</p>
<p>然則，這些看法，未免太早了些，太遠了些；明天，果爾有金銀市塲的具體化，那末響應着前昨二天港地金價的暴跳，市面可能翻騰一番的。</p>
<h3>四礦聯營處　昨調整煤價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四礦聯營處各檔煤價，昨日又告調整，新價外國煤每噸二七三·二二〇元。基隆煤每噸一三〇·四二〇元。開濼煤每噸一二六·八六〇元。其他白煤　，白煤小子，長城煤塊等均仍維原價。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕電力公司燃料大量續有到滬，昨日有巴拿馬輪喀爾力特號，德士古公司經理，由波斯灣運來電力公司之柴油，一萬五十餘噸，預定日傍晚進口後，卽在卅一·卅二號浮筒拋泊起卸。又茂泰洋行代理之俄輪提開別利斯脫號，由海參崴載煤六千噸，約今日可到，預定停泊董家渡中棧起卸。上項之煤斤，係中信局交換物資。</p>
<h3>羊毛運滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕天祥洋行代理之新輪雪都斯號，處女航由澳洲來滬，運來大宗羊毛，計七百餘包，前日抵滬，泊公和祥碼頭起卸。</p>
<h3>棉紗再見高翔　布市止漲回跌</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗再見高翔，由於公用事業根據生活指數調整後，廠方不勝以七萬元開出，十時許聞金鈔迫跌，圈外亦受阻力，人心渙散，散多咸不主守，削價脫手，中途曾低見六萬八千元，臨收空方略有抵補，價乃回至六萬九千五百元午收，較前挫二千元。喇叭童與大雙龍細布平均各跌三千五百元。</p>
<p>四君子元嘩嘰由六萬七千三百元，一路盤小至六萬四千八百元結局，終降二千元。金蓮妙舞元嗶嘰獨升五百元，四君子元直貢鬆落一千九百元，餘布均趨軟態，收後聞塲外斬售未已，市面續見做小。午後嗶嘰做七萬二千元，龍頭則無成交。</p>
<h3>凡立頂動銷</h3>
<p>凡立頂呢日來市銷步起，本客各幫均有相當進胃，素色凡立頂較條子為普及，顏色則以淡米色為大路。昨本廠頭號貨每碼齊喊批三萬六千元，二號貨三萬二千五百元，三號貨二萬六七千元，進出均係隔日票子</p>
<h3>絲綢疲軟</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市勢轉疲，市上銀根趨緊，暗息回升，聞國行拋售金銀，銀根將續趨緊俏，人心轉軟，更逢週六，執戶負息過中，市上脫意甚切。</p>
<p>一二〇號天橋晨開卽期二一〇萬，下週一頭寸二三五萬，開後賣氣甚濃，實消不振，市況步低，小至二〇〇萬，午收為二〇二萬，午後無市。</p>
<p>生絲以外匯證市勢續漲，人心看俏，惟因金價疲軟，銀根趨俏，多頭脫貨放息，頗　合算，於是市況平庸，D級78勻度日廠絲，晨開三三〇萬，聞後納胃慘淡，供過於求，喊價步小，午收當日頭寸三一〇萬，午後無喊價。</p>
<p>綢緞昨日市勢平軟，圈外黃金壓小，紗布均平，業內銀根微俏，人心頗　。晨開美亞被面一五二萬，檯面卽起拉抬，一度好起三萬元，最後賣風轉盛，新買觀望，市卽回軟，低至一四八萬，臨收散戶續有吐售，市況續小，終以一四六萬午收，午後無市。</p>
<h3>糖市明升暗降</h3>
<p>食糖昨市趨勢甚疲，客銷滯呆，市上銀根微俏，買戶觀望，檯面又逢高傾吐，午收均以低價結束，四半午收七四七〇〇元，帶息微升二七〇〇元，粗砂六九〇〇元升五百元，成交多為下週一貸款，其餘各檔均明升暗疲。</p>
<h3>茶市疾進</h3>
<p>自賣戶感於紅綠茶到存稀罕，態度咸懷堅守後，日前怡和洋行對祁門紅茶，雖一度展開攻勢，終又敗下陣來，惟最近屯綠大幫等，永興·錦隆·兩洋行亦擬企圖侵襲，能否得逞，尚在醞釀中。而昨市趨勢，則追隨圈外物資，復又疾進。至於內銷茶，授受亦不活潑，過程靜中迭堅，行情步步產新。</p>
<h3>桐油呆滯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃向熟悉桐油者探悉：桐油漲風，接連蔓延後，昨日市上，在圈外物品賡續飛揚中，雖亦跟隨翱翔，惟趨勢跡近外強中亁。緣因國外市價仍低，出口益形艱難，同時內銷，因漲率過猛，購買力無不減遜，照此情形，如仍任其砌升，前途並不樂觀。</p>
<h3>中農詳擬計劃　推動絲茶貸款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕絲茶為我國出口之大宗，每年換取外匯不貲，勝利後中國農民銀行卽奉命舉辦絲茶貸款，對活潑農村經濟，鼓勵生產，集中物資，推廣出口頗具成效。本年度貸款工作，雖以時局關係，然仍極力推動，以維護農村，經已詳擬計劃，卽交國行貼放委員會審查，一俟通過而付事實，聞該項貸款，將採取定貸方式，而以當時外匯轉移證價格為標準。</p>
<h3>華股市況穩定　洋股疲軟金債俏秀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股市況，昨日走勢先堅後疲，臨收略見抬頭。業外黃金市勢平疲，游資重復回籠，更以連跌有日，各幫逢低思進，於是買氣轉盛，市況堅盤於前半程。中間因銀根感緊，實物市塲一致報跌，更聞央行拋售銀元，收縮通貨下週一銀根勢必抽緊，因此人心又虛，抬面軟風再起，市況轉入下坡，嗣後逢低有吸，價見穩定，永紗晨初在各方買氣籠罩下人心尚佳，以六元九角高盤開出，開後空起補納，卽升至七元一七元一二，隔夜多頭了售，又挫至七元，七元〇二，紗幫起納，續升至七元一，七一二，企業幫吐售，又小至六元九八，七元，金融幫翻多為空，市勢一路低檔盤旋，小至六元六六，廣幫逢低力扳，又升至六元七八，八一，最後逐步盤升至七元一五，七元一七高峯，高後證券幫猛售，又小至六元五九，六二，臨收浮散戶重復吸納，市況穩定而以六元八角午收。</p>
<p>中小型股晨開平庸，後因永紗走勢穩堅，人心帶俏，買氣驟旺，午收再見平疲，美亞信和新光景福開後均一度挺秀，美亞高至二元〇五，信和一元七，新光五角七五，景福二角六，勤興三角四五，午收仍回，其餘一度漲停者計有景綸，新華百貨，中國內衣，閘北水電，景福等五種，全日成交六二億八千八百念萬股。</p>
<p>外股昨日塲外因港市報疲，市況欲振乏力，更因銀根微緊，空方多進一天利息，故脫意甚濃，市勢疲軟。怡紗一四一〇〇元，一四三〇〇元，英聯喊一九〇〇〇元，二〇〇〇〇元，亞洲一·三四〇元，一·三六〇元，軋高半成以上。會德豐喊五萬二，五五〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>黃金公債昨市走勢仍高，喊開二四五〇〇〇進，嗣升至二八五〇〇〇元。午收為三〇萬元。</p>
<h3>由重慶至滬出口貨運　中信局奉命承保兵險</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會息：我國外銷品夙以農畜產品如桐油茶葉豬　等為大宗。此等貨品產區廣佈內地，以往均藉長江為其貨運之大動脈轉運上海出口。近半年來因時局關係長江運輸異常困難，不僅運繳高昂且風險尤大，營運者相率望而卻步，或則改道南遷廣州，遂致上海存底日虛，出口深受影響。輸管會有鑒於此亟謀解決此項困難，同時並採擇各有關方面意見，經函請有關當局旊照抗戰期間成例恢復辦理出口貨運之兵險。茲此項建議業經財政部同意並已委託中央信託局代辦，其承保條件經探悉為</p>
<p>（一）範圍：暫以長江一綫自重慶至上海之輪船運輸為限。</p>
<p>（二）標的：以農工鑛業產品及一切民生日用必須品為限，軍火金銀貨幣及奢侈品等不包括內。</p>
<p>（三）保險責任：採取國際通用之水險公會兵險條件。</p>

<h3>市長盃新盟主　今日可見分曉　鐵路中航下午逸園決賽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕去週市長盃決賽，因春雨被延阻，改期今日下午三時仍在逸園舉行，本屆市長盃新盟主今日當可產生。這是鐵路與中航爭奪該盃之千載一時之機會</p>
<p>屆時吳市長將蒞塲開球並主持給獎，冠軍隊可得獎吳市長贈銀盟一座及足球協會銀質獎章十五枚，亞軍隊銅質獎章十五枚。門票分八百及一千二百元兩種，十二時半起在體育館發售。</p>
<p>決賽延期一週，在時間上是給予中航以鍛煉和去香港招將之機會，所謂「蓄銳以待時」。倘要抱奪得錦標之野心祇須在香港借來三位健將，錦標自可篤定到手，若不借將而祇招回舊人田榕發·莊文權·梁明星三人，亦足以增厚全隊之實力，況中航有中興之勢，當可掃除在聯賽時連輸七球予鐵路之驚慌心理，諸小將須要膽大心細，務使兩翼齊飛，足以牽制鐵路之衛，前衛宜設法控制中塲，箝制陸蕭兩內鋒，力拼到底，則鹿死誰手，須經激戰始能決定。</p>
<p>要知在淘汰賽中，須要有能拼足九十分鍾之氣力與速度，才能發揮技巧和繼續維持良好之狀態，但球運亦為重要因素。</p>
<p>鐵路仍是原班人馬，採用腳裏灣之短傳戰術，有默契之聯絡，高保正之穩健第三內衛防守，陸慶祥之頭攻，張傑之竄勢，所缺者速度與前鋒乏善射之人，兩翼未臻理想，然以實力與經騐言，略勝中航一籌，倘若在上陣時抱有患得患失之心情，則可能被中航以可乘之機會，若有良好之狀態登塲，未始非無勝中航之機會，因鐵路是一隊之踢法，須要十一人都要有佳妙之狀態，才能在巔峯狀態下演出，苟初踢時未見上路應沉着應戰，腳風一順，自然續漸上路，須知靜者勝，躁者敗，今日之能否操勝券乃在鐵路本身之能否運用智略，以應付挾其全力而來之中航而定也。</p>

<h3>志超不景氣　一比三又敗於精武　逸園春寒料峭球迷興緻不佳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕足球聯賽甲組第二循環，昨日重行開始，精武志超逢於逸園，春寒砭骨，風雨欲來，球迷興緻不佳，捧塲者不足五百人，景象凄淸。志超雖有吳祺祥坐鎮中堅，奈孤掌難鳴，以一比三敗於精武，上半時一對鴨蛋，未開記錄。</p>
<p>上半時雙方一鼓作氣，相持不下，各無所獲。下半時志超先中十二碼球，為之歡喜不止，不料局勢轉變，精武一隻任意球，直送志超網底，打成各一後，志超小將開始洩氣，精武則愈打愈有勁，一連獲中二球，三比一終局。吳祺祥最後親自出征，調任中鋒，率領全軍反撲，亦無效果。志超守門張德隆大彈琵琶，顯示沙塲得失，經騐大有關係。</p>
<p>精武開球進攻，五鋒猛襲，遇阻截回。方紉秋再舉義旗，沿邊疾走，遠遠塞中，吳敬仁一射偏出。志超不甘雌伏，朱家錚帶球深入，派司盛彼得，騙過黃立甫，陳惠民棄門出迎，盛一射中鄭德耀腿部彈出，關永常趕到一碰出界。此後雙方僵持不下，上半時以一對鴨蛋告終。易邊再戰雙方原陣不動，志超盛彼得單騎刧營，排　直入禁區，郁琪絆人犯下天條，錢允慶主罰，一射入網，但以朱家錚衝入，取銷重罰，盛彼得操刀，一蹴中的，志超先得一球，精武心有未甘，大張撻伐，五鋒滲入志超腹地，張德隆顧此失彼，形成空門一座，莊心佳一射，幸祺祥在內擋出。精武調出李榮邦休息，以汪國光入代，攻勢果然大盛。十五分鍾陸義德在禁區外犯手球，吳敬仁主罰任意球，球出如矢，直入洞房，為精武扳成和局。未幾，精武得意再來，莊心佳帶球直入，挑過陸義德，一拉入網，又建一功，成二對一，後來居上。此時陸義德因抽筋下野，顧而祿入內庖代，精武攻勢仍盛，如火如茶，吳敬仁前度劉郎，再入天台。吳祺祥出外助攻，不及返防，吳敬仁得機在卅碼外暗放冷箭，直趨下落，張德隆意猿心馬，大彈琵琶，球竟由胯下滑入。志超經此打擊，怒燄高張，吳祺祥與盛彼得互易位置，出掛帥印，但諸小將已筋疲力盡，強弩之末，已無能為力。時間旣屆，精武以三比一勝志超。</p>

<h3>今晚籃球連台好戲　華聯再戰麥令斯　東華逢懋勛不啻冠軍決賽　黎隊對星華雙方勢均力敵</h3>
<p>四屆籃聯今晚續有甲女組三塲，下午五時半起在市體育館交鋒，門票照舊五百一千及對號一千五百元三種，三時開始發售，四維童軍維持球塲秩序。</p>
<p>星華——黎隊（女子組）五時卅分</p>
<p>東華——懋勛（甲二A）六時一刻</p>
<p>華聯——麥令斯（甲一組）七時一刻</p>
<p>娘子軍唱開塲戲，星華重逢黎隊，第一循環中星華以卅七比四〇，一球半之差飲恨。者番冤家狹路，豈肯放鬆，且兩隊在女組中除綠隊外，實力相等，最稱強勁，亞軍一席勢所不爭，星華隊中名將新人雲集，惜以隊長王慧玲始終未克出塲，不無影響軍心，但王珊朱家珍汪澤倫錢夢月等在此緊要關頭，必作力爭，黎隊錢氏姊妹花為其靈魂，姚思濂亦屬個中好手，今晚為保持令譽奪取亞軍起見，與星華必有　鬥。</p>
<p>繼之甲二A組東華懋勛會師，係該組主力戰，前者兩仗俱勝，後者三戰三捷，不啻冠軍決賽，緊張刺激自在意中。東華陣內除蔡演雄周達雲原屬籃壇鬥士外，其餘悉為足球名將，全隊作風潑刺，陷陣斬關，剽悍異常，演雄祥龍幼良李垚等合作亦見緊湊。惟今晚相遇懋勛亦非阿蒙，劉昭仁卓觀政等身手殊活，而孫家雯投籃為該隊得分之錀，屆時究屬誰勝誰負，殊難預卜。</p>
<p>壓軸甲一組華聯再戰麥令斯，亦為重頭好戲，華聯盟主球藝之精，人才之眾，如大李阿弟松圓等無庸贅述，卽該隊新人樂嘉洲李漢亭亦均為傑出好手，嘉洲投籃如有神助，漢亭衝營踏陣玲俐敏捷，首循麥令斯以一分之差受挫於華聯，自難甘服，今晚番軍捲土重來，其意不善，況麥隊諸將身高臂長，擅於防守，華聯進攻不易，卽言攻勢，番將利斯，勃拉曼，哥芬斯亦殊凶悍，最近該隊曾以五七比四二大破滬警，亦證其潛力之充沛，不可以其過去平庸而輕忽，培斐爾之獲勝華聯，東鑒未遠也。</p>
<h3>培斐爾失常　滬警大勝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽，滬警昨晚再敗培斐爾，五十六比四十分。上半時美軍廿八比廿一，落後七分。培斐爾前週擊敗盟主華聯，又勝麥令斯，大為球迷注目，不料昨晚表演失常，投籃減色，縷擲不中，滬警則得心應手，球運甚佳。上半時滬警曾以二十比九領前十一分之多。培斐爾力追，黑人勃朗滿塲飛奔，上半時分數距離，縮為廿八比廿一分。下半時滬警仍保持六七分之領導者甚久。迨黑人勃朗被罰，一怒下塲，培斐爾之陣腳，全部動搖，滬警之球，聯珠射入，美軍遂無法挽救，最大比數為五十五比三十五，相差二十分之多。終塲結果五十六比四十。女子組約翰勝力隊三十比十八，上半時約翰十四比十一領先。甲二組汕隊勝崇德，五十比二十五，上半時廿五比十二，分數之比例為二對一。</p>
<p>滬警以王伯文何增史久全傳其俠王蓉生上塲迎戰。</p>
<p>王伯文首開紀錄，勃朗回敬，何增竄入，美軍呌停。蓉生犯規，何增施展神威，梅開兩度，派克司規犯小何又兩罰兩中，滬警以十比三遙領，泊文又是一球，培斐爾的球常在籃圈上轉，僅賴罰球添分，得不償失。比數成為二十比九。才由勃朗兩擲一罰連得五分，退至廿一比廿六時，王伯文受傷離塲，梁永標入替，永標下塲建功，廿八比廿一，前半時結束，滬警佔先七分。</p>
<p>易籃過後，其俠首中，伊卡特立刻扳回，兩軍拉鋸，卅二比廿五時，何增犯規畢業，王蓉生入代，滬警球勢再盛，梁永標三元連中，久全獲得四分，美軍僅克勒長射中一球，比數廿九比四十。培斐爾猶圖力爭，無奈滬警嚴力重重，四五比卅三，五一比卅五，美軍屢次呼停，計窮力竭，其俠金典雙中，五五比卅五，相差二十分。終塲培斐爾以四〇比五六再敗於滬警。</p>

<h3>約翰勝力隊</h3>
<p>女子組約翰對力對，約翰棋高一着，第一節聲威並茂，使力隊小姊妹一籌莫展，成六比〇一面倒局面，安知第二節力隊梁妙玲范玉兩人，斬關奪壘，十二比十緊張逼人。約翰李淼四次犯規離塲，由鄭靜淵代，上半時約翰十四，力隊十一分。第三節約翰吳漢蓮·林靜怡分頭進攻，力隊守將矮小，很為吃虧，是節為廿二比十五。末節廿四比十五時，力隊姚文達亦四次犯規，</p>
<p>王嘉萃入替。此後雙方犯規纍纍，時常罰球，觀眾有興趣索然之勢，約翰鄭靜淵亦五次出外，五人終塲，但仍以三十比十八勝。</p>

<h3>汕隊克崇德</h3>
<p>甲二D汕隊逢崇德，汕隊上塲卽五分，不同凡響，遂使崇德嚇勢勢而呌停。十分鍾的戰局成十五比五，以後五分鍾，大家沒有什麽開展，上半時汕隊廿五，崇德十二。下半時崇德頗有中興氣象，無奈汕隊的攻勢有增無減，結果五十比廿八，勝利仍歸諸汕隊。</p>

<h3>體壇新猷　無綫電傳真攝取　牛津劍橋划舟賽</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕英國將有對牛與劍橋兩大學之划舟大比賽，作無綫電傳影廣播之可能，其初主辦者以為在一速駛之小輪上，作無綫電傳影之舉，為頗難成功之事，但經考騐後，已有相當成就，現決於賽時，在輪上用旋轉鏡頭攝影遠近景，傳與八個安置在泰晤士河沿岸之八個收接轉播鏡頭，再轉送至安置在亞歷山大宮之無綫電傳影廣播處播送，以多個廣播鏡頭，攝取單一項運動，實為破天荒壯舉云。</p>
<h3>蛙式與蝴蝶式　將分別作泳賽</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕蝴蝶式泳應否視作淘汰（習慣如蛙式）之一種，久已引起討論，雖則多數以為蝴蝶式泳與淘汰為完全不同之游泳方式，但亦有以為實應視作同類者，查在最近一次奧林匹克大會之後，國際體育會議曾將澳洲人提議，應將此兩項游泳，分作兩項不同之項目舉行一案，提出研究，結果在付表決時，曾得以四十二票對三十一票通過在案，但其後又有國際游泳聯會，亦曾對此事選出研究委員研究，結果通過推翻當時議案故現下將何去何從，則仍有疑問也。查美國則為贊成蝴蝶式與胸泳應作同式觀者，現國際游泳聯會舊主席英人歡恩氏，曾以管理權威身份，表示對推翻前案事加以反對，照此以觀，則除非今年將在義大利開會之會議終議決有所更改，卽蝴蝶式泳之遭多數同意在世運會中，仍作為一種胸泳換，實大有可能云。</p>
<h3>香港網球比賽　盡是華將天下</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕香港十七日的草地網球雙打半複賽，晋入複賽週的四組，繼單打之後，又是華將的天下。雖然四塲之中，仍有三塲僅賽兩盤卽分別高下，但得勝者勝來，卻並不如成績所表露的一樣容易，無一塲勝利不是經過對方相當威脅而後獲得的。葉觀雄和李惠堂，雖則獲得兩個六對二的絕大勝利，但他們的全盤勝利，還比賽足三盤的第一號塲一役完成得較慢一點，可見當時是每一局卻經過不少苦鬥纔分出高下的。最難得的是蔡炳芬和陸錠祥一對，他們雖遭逢着那對本港最出色的雙打組，可是在奮鬥之下，只輸個四對六和五對七之比。李文成與陳德燦都是南洋靑年歸僑，拔術已相當不俗，然而年近耳順的老律師羅文惠與靑春已過的洋人希能，在第一盤竟能予以絕大之威脅，卒賽至十二局之多而後敗下，亦是難能可貴之事。若照昨前兩日的觀察：我以為葉觀雄本屆不獨單打冠軍呼聲甚高，卽對雙打錦標，如到時李惠堂也能出演他應有水準的話，則我以為他們也有奪獲的可能。</p>

<h3>女子籃球術</h3>
<p>— 戚公譯述</p>
<p>圖六：在進攻者之心理上是見其虛則進，見其實則止」，而在守衛者之應付是戰戰兢兢，深恐一處失利，則全部瓦解，故審甚應付，因敵易形」這是移動區域制之骨髓。</p>
<p>圖示右守　　看管之進攻者已經沒有球控　在手裏，她就應將其位置移動去看管另一位持球之進攻者，而正中衛看到右守衛去看管持球者，她須立卽退回原防之第二道防綫來恢復原來之防禦陣式。</p>
<p>圖七：右守衛仍然是看管着持球之進攻者，圖中所指示的灣曲綫是球員之奔跑預定路綫。倘若皮球再傳到同邊之更深入區域，則正中衛衝前看管持球者，若球是被傳到右方之尖角上去，則左守衛跑向右方之籃下來看管持球者，而正中衛迅卽跑回到籃圈與罰球綫之中間來看管着這段區域。在採用這第四個移動陣式，左守衛是第三道防綫，她要注意着其他的進攻者得有持球在手之機會，為着這個區域是靠近籃圈之下，也是進攻者獲分之危險地帶。倘若球是被進攻者遠傳遞到籃之左方，則左守衛在原來之位置處衝向持球者而前去而看管着她，正中衛仍守中央的第二道防綫，右守衛有如圖三之陣形，退守第三道防綫；運用上四項之移動區域制，須要有默契之聯絡。</p>
<p>籃球防禦戰術旣有進步，但亦有更精巧之進攻戰術來攻破進步的防守戰術，蓋「以智遇智」「以詐遇詐」猶有巧拙之分，苟非審察敵情而運用攻勢，則勢難攻破其防禦陣，故太公有曰：「兵勝之術，密察敵人之機，而速乘其利，復疾擊其不意」才能收效。</p>
<p>在實際上之比賽而言攻守，進攻的隊伍當然是運用各種方式來進攻守方的移動區域防禦戰陣的，在上面曾提及過進攻隊伍有時運用三位進攻者集中在一個區域來壓迫守方的一個區域的。然而，進攻的隊伍可以採用以快打慢的方式來攻破移動區域防禦制的，這個方式是在東區塲邊來做一接一傳來牽制守方之守衛之位置，要移動到東區塲邊來防守，這一來，祇要進攻者能施展迅傳及橫互過塲的斜角遠傳，遞到西區的進攻者，可以做成該進攻者輕易得到投籃的機會。為着守方的守衛或許來不及移動其區域來看管，突然在西區出現的進攻者，志守衛鞭長莫及，但採用三道防綫之移動區域防禦制，其效用可用以應付上項之進攻戰術，祇須要在移動時能保持着在該範圍內之區域，填補着三道防綫之空檔來擱截對方之傳遞，則進攻者終必遭遇到阻撓的，而後面兩道防綫之守衛不須要一定向着在前者守衛之背後來站立，這點須要注意的。（未完五）</p>

<h3>「需要」篇</h3>
<p>— 劉隨</p>
<p>記得是很久以前的事了，影院業勞資之間鬧糾紛。勞方逢人便說資方如何心狠，賺了那麼多的錢，對職工待遇還是異常苛刻一。那一陣子彷彿各影院開映的都是些好萊塢最無聊的低級趣味影片，我倒有一次很天眞地問他們：那麼壞的片子還會賺錢嗎？他們回答得太妙了：壞片子有什麼關係？反正上海人「需要」它！越無聊越是賣座！</p>
<p>「需要」確實是最現實的。做人需要大米·煤球，做人有時也需要看戯·抽烟，無可厚非。但是上海人的做人，却更需要這些以外的東西。眼前就有許多例子：范雪君被捧成了彈詞皇后，很有幾家報紙雜誌對此大事譴責；理由是對的，國步艱難，玩物喪志。但是聽設皇后加冕大典的參觀劵印了五千張，頃刻被人索完，後來托情關說想弄到幾張去躬逢其盛的，還是接踵而至。我相信譴責對於這件事的本身，怕不會有太大的影響，因為有人需要它！</p>
<p>還有這兩天鬧得滿天風雨的孫科先生與藍妮女士的公案，監委交章糾彈，據報紙上說是為了怕「國家綱紀解紐，官塲廉恥喪盡」，其實上海人對這件事的關懷，並不下於監察委員們，在很多塲合常聽有人互詢：「你知道藍妮過去的那……」因為藍妮是一偭女人，尤其是一個具有緋色故事的女人，所以大家都「需要」追究，探聽，顯然地，藍妮本身的比重在一般人心頭是要超越「綱紀和廉恥」之上的。</p>
<p>無綫電一開，隨時隨地都可以聽到那麼一連串的，軟綿綿的所謂流行歌曲。曲旣號稱流行，當然是因為大衆熱烈「需要」它。隋書上記載在開皇初年有一個名叫萬寳常的樂工，聞當時太常奏樂，泫然而泣，據說他表示那些樂音「淫厲而哀」，是亡國之聲；歷史上證實，結果到大業末年，「天下相殺將盡」。我對音樂一知半解，想像當中，萬實常那時所指為一哀怨滛放，非雅正之音」，以及「以小呂為變徵，乖相生之道」的流行歌曲，不見得就是眼前鼻管裏帶哭聲唱出來的一套」你的眼睛溜來溜去看不停」等等吧，否則人是有選擇好惡的智慧的，假使那些「歌選」—比貝多芬樂集還要豐富的歌選—果眞預兆「天下相殺將盡」為什麼每天大家「點唱電話」像雪片一樣，需要得那麼誠懇和眞切呢？</p>
<p>有一天，我偶然在中區一個圍書館裏，看到一位年老的外僑在孜孜地埋頭傾讀，這人衣衫並不整潔，傾讀那本厚厚的原版書，顯得異常虔誠，那本書皮上好像有「莎士比亞」幾僩字，我心頭竊想這位老人怎的『需要』起「莎士比亞」來？私議未定，接着在他身後又發現兩個小夥子搶讀一册畫報，其中一個對另一個說：不要搶吧，今天晚上我請客看童芷苓的劈紡！邊說邊從身畔摸出一張什麼戯院的節目單來，洋洋得意的樣子。我倒抽一口冷氣退了出來，直到現在我還相信：那天晚上一定有無數小夥子，為了「需要」瞻仰扭着屁股高唱『京朝戯」，而去拼命軋買票子的吶！</p>
<h3>新西裝的故事</h3>
<p>— 筆鋒</p>
<p>在愛爾蘭的貝爾佛地方，添置衣着是受到嚴格限制的·一位當地人旅行到愛爾蘭南部的杜勃林去，這裏什麼也不受到限制。於是，他買了一整套西裝—還有襯衫，皮鞋，帽子，甚至內衣，襪子，領帶。他把新的服裝都放在一隻箱子裏，將箱子交給一個脚夫，叫他第二天送到去貝爾佛的火車上。他的計劃是在火車到達之前換上新裝，拋去舊衣服，如此可免得受到貝爾佛海關的留難。</p>
<p>第二天，火車開行後，他拿丁箱子，把自己關在盥洗室內—將舊衣服脫光，遂卽拋向窗外。但是等他打開箱子時，却大吃一驚，原來除了一本舊電話簿和一束報紙外，已是一隻完全空空的箱子了。</p>
<h3>人工珠寶的奇蹟</h3>
<p>— 蒼雨</p>
<p>如果有一家珠寳店的訂貨單上，寫着：「二百呎紅寳石一枝」，你會覺得這位珠寳商人太荒唐胡鬧嗎？</p>
<p>事實上，一點也不。他當然可以開這樣一張訂貨單，而且，也一定可以買到這樣的一種貨物</p>
<p>農人們會知道，在溫暖的夏季，有些時候，蘆筍可以在一小時內生長半吋。你覺得可驚嗎？但是，蘆筍的生長速度，却還比不上紅寳石快，這才是眞令人驚奇的事呢。美國印第安那州的蘭德人工珠寳廠，在它熊熊的火爐裏，紅寳石每年的生長速度有數百哩之長。</p>
<p>蘭德人工珠寳廠，是世界上製造人工珠寳的代表者。它的新發明源源不絕，工作之精美，可以媲美天然珠寳。如果不是有豐富經騐的珠寳商人或專家，就休想能將眞偽分辨出來。</p>

<h3>美國的自殺者</h3>
<p>— 曹國平</p>
<p>自殺在美國是極普通的事。自殺者的年齡與自殺的原因，則各有不同。美國聖路易大學的米海諾維兄敎授，最近曾作了一個調查，其結果如下：</p>
<p>近二十年來，有百分之四十二的自殺者，是從四十五歲到六十四歲的人們。而在二十年前，在四十五歲以上的自殺者，僅百分之三十。</p>
<p>另一個調查顯示：白人的自殺率要比黑人高得多。雖然在聖路易城，黑人佔全城人口百分之十，其自殺率不及百分之三。</p>
<p>以人來分析，結過婚的占百分之五十五；獨身者占百分二十三；寡婦與離婚者自殺的較少。</p>
<p>平均男子自殺者最多的是工人。一般女子的輕生者，則是以家庭主婦為多。　自殺的原因是什麼？據克柏屈立克博士送給紐約醫學會的報吿中說，自殺是由於「自尊」與「自恨」。一個人的自殺，據克博士分析，是由於他不能達到一個目的，因而對於自己及世界起了厭惡。自殺是表示恨惡世界及自身到極點，以求毀滅自己或累連人家。</p>
<p>自殺最好的避免方法，是要瞭解自己，——求內心穩固的發展。其次，宗敎對於减少自殺，亦很佔重要地位：因為一切敎會均嚴禁自殺，同時，最虔誠的信徒少有輕生者。再其次是敎育的力量，使人能明瞭人生的價值，以减少輕生之念。成功一半</p>

<h3>鐵道票價問題</h3>
<p>— 企年</p>
<p>戰前鐵道客運票價，以里程長短核算，卽站與站之間，行程偶有差別，其價必隨同有異，雖分角微　，絕不增損，堪稱公允。</p>
<p>勝利初期，物價波動頻繁，鐵道交通因係公用事業之一，價格常獨屹立不動，數月一調整，遂益顯其低廉。惟戰後鐵路係採用分段計值制，路途雖有遠近，售價殊鮮區別，路近乘客固感吃虧，但以代價過低，力能勝任，亦無怨言。</p>
<p>惟近來公用事業已隨物價昇漲，一旬一價，變幻莫測。鐵道票價，為維護其本身利潤計，豈肯例外？經屢次調整結果，數自已不在小，而路近路遠，仍無軒輊，票價雖稱遠遜戰前，但揆諸實情，短距離者，反感大大吃虧，試觀下例。</p>
<p>如由滬至崑，百餘華里，三等票價計一千二百元，以當時米價折算，約合戰前四五角之譜，尙稱合宜。但由崑至正儀，十數華里，計價千元，約合三角餘；再由正儀至唯亭，路短僅九華里，其價亦同。復以戰前相較，由崑山至正儀售洋兩角，由正儀至唯亭售一角則以今視昔，豈非倍蓗？此均由於採用分段計值制之結果。</p>
<p>再就今日搭客分析之，長距離者，類多單帮客，並非正式之旅客。彼等藉兩地物價之差異，往返負販，以圖厚利，携箱帶籠，使車上秩序無法維持，此原為路局所處心積慮亟欲取締者，今反予以低廉之票價優待之，誠令人大惑不解。而短距離者，類多城鎭平民及正規商人，乃路局眞正之服務對象，彼等原賴火車交通之便利，相互作公事上之磋商，商業上之接洽，及友誼上之聯繫，今適反售以高價票，背道而馳，寗非有違初意？</p>
<p>輔助鐵道短程交通之舟楫座價，原依車票之高低作昇降標準，今則自然水漲船高。於是在雙重高價威脅下，小民裏足難行，無不叫苦。為减輕小民負担，求公允合理計，鐵道當局對自前之分段計值制，似有亟須修芷或廢除之必要。若謂路局收入，因而將受損减，則截短補長，當仍可無慮於得失也。</p>

<h3>「生死恨」試片參觀記</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>中國第一部五彩影片，梅蘭芳博士主演的「生死恨」，於三月十八日上午十時半在皇后影院試片，余以偶然的機會，得入參觀，並得晤許姬傳君（此片劇藝顧問），深為慶幸。茲略寫幾句，以為此片介紹。</p>
<p>此片導演為費穆，彩色錄音技術指導為顏鶴鳴，除梅博士主演韓玉娘外，重要的演員，有姜妙香之程鵬舉，王少亭之旗牌趙尋等。劇中故事，凡在舞台上看過博士此劇者，皆能知之，不過影片與舞台劇，究有分別，我參觀後，知劇情略有改動。第一：此片仍用電影布景制度，不用舞台做背景，因為如用舞台做背景，放映時就不免呆板，單調了。第二：舞台上磨房一塲，此片刪去，全劇顯得緊凑多；尼腌一塲，舞台上本描畫老尼為一壞人，此片則演成一好人，此為導演的眼光遠大處。全劇最精采的一塲為「夜訴」，收慕的劇情尤好。</p>
<p>此片問世之動機，有如費穆先生和梅博士所言。梅博士言：「我這次拍演電影有兩種目的：第一點是許多我不能去的邊遠偏僻的地方，影片都能去。第二點，我幾十年來所學得的國劇藝術，借了電影，可以流布人間，供我們下一代的藝人一點參考的材料」。</p>
<p>費先生言：「梅博士和他的時代的夥伴—例如周信芳，蓋叫天兩位先生—幾乎一致地有了這樣的警覺。他們認為當代的平劇家的任務，已不僅在登台獻藝，供奉觀衆；也不僅在改革舊劇內容，硬放天足；主要的，有意義的工作，不如把够得上水準的演技紀錄了，在夕陽黃昏，稍縱卽逝的時候，留給人一點「規矩」，給人批評和給人觀摩」。</p>
<p>此片雖以布景姿態演出，仍保有舊劇抽象的美，具有東方文化藝術獨特的優點。唱詞有二黃元板，西皮元板，快板，散板，慢板，南梆子，二六搖板，梅博士的各種好腔都在裏頭了。彩色艷麗，可與西片媲美，確係一部成功的作品。看過梅博士舞台上此戯者，不可不看；未看過博士此戯者，似更不可不一看此片。</p>

<h3>Bohai Bay, Huludao Port: Rebel Ship Chongqing Bombed and Destroyed; Some Officers and Soldiers Have Complied with Persuasion and Landed</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 19th] The 7,000-ton naval rebel ship Chongqing, after desperately returning south, was bombed today by Air Force B-24 aircraft. According to preliminary reports, the ship has been hit by two large bombs in Huludao Port in Bohai Bay, sustaining initial damage. As of the time of this dispatch, Air Force heavy aircraft are continuing to bomb the vessel under the personal aerial command of Commander Chen Jiashang of the Second Military Region.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 19th] Twenty days after the defection of the Chinese Navy ship Chongqing on February 26th, it was bombed by Chinese Air Force aircraft at the CCP-controlled seaport of Huludao, inflicting heavy damage. During the twenty days since its defection, its life at sea was quite miserable. In the first two days, the Shanghai Port Radio Station of the Naval Headquarters still believed it was fighting winds and waves on its way to Taiwan. From the third day, it began broadcasting from Dong Yantai Port, expressing its embrace of the CCP. When the Naval Headquarters discovered its disappearance, the authorities knew the inside story was serious, but dared not completely determine that it had defected to the Communists at all costs. It was not until the long-range reconnaissance aircraft of the Air Force first discovered the massive hull of the Chongqing in Yantai Port on March 3rd that the ship's whereabouts were fully confirmed. The military immediately began studying how to deal with the situation and immediately contacted the Chongqing's radio station by radio waves. The Chongqing also knew that if it did not feign compliance when aircraft shadows swept across the sky, it would inevitably face immediate disaster. Therefore, it also sent out false reports from time to time, claiming that there were disagreements on board and that if they waited a while, they might return south. This dragged on until March 10th. At that time, while the Naval Headquarters was communicating with the ship, it dispatched the Haiheng gunboat from March 3rd to deploy in the Changshan Island area at the southern end of the Miaodao Strait to monitor the Bohai Sea entrance. Another transport ship carrying a guard battalion of soldiers went to Liujiagou in Penglai County on March 14th to land, in order to enter Yantai from the ground. They also reported that the Chongqing was still docked in Yantai on the 9th, but disappeared on the 10th. The battalion commander then learned from the people in the CCP-controlled area in Penglai that more than 20 sailors from Longkou, Huang County, had landed in Yantai, then retired and returned to their hometowns. The CCP had mobilized the villagers to celebrate their return. At the same time, it was learned that because the CCP did not fully trust the ship, it had ordered some of the officers and soldiers to disembark and replaced them with some elite Communist officers and soldiers to assist. The CCP also knew that it was very dangerous for the ship to dock in Yantai. If it wanted to immediately use the ship to go south and fight with the remaining naval vessels, it was impossible emotionally. Furthermore, Communist military strategists and officers on board had also warned of the terrifying power of the Air Force. If it returned to the Soviet-controlled port of Lushun, it could escape the danger of being bombed, but the Soviet Union would be drawn into an international negotiation. In the end, it had no choice but to sail north, turn west at the northern end of the Miaodao Islands into the Bohai Sea, and then sail north to Huludao Port in Liaodong Bay. When the Chongqing finally reached this port of refuge after such a miserable northward voyage, the officers and soldiers on board had been completely worn down of their rebellious spirit when they left Shanghai due to the lack of heavy oil, fresh water, and a lack of unified will. After making various replenishments in Huludao and slightly recovering their spirits and physical strength, they really did not know where their next destination would be, and at this time, the long arm of the Air Force finally reached them again. On March 14th, when the Air Force learned again that the Chongqing had disappeared from Yantai, it immediately dispatched reconnaissance aircraft to search the ocean in different directions. One of them carried Staff Officer Xu from the Naval Headquarters and flew along the coast of Jiaodong Peninsula to Yantai, where it found three merchant ships, and then flew to Changshan Island. Another even traced the coastline of the Liaodong Peninsula all the way to the Yalu River. Another route was in Bohai Bay. After two days of reconnaissance, on the 15th, a C-47 aircraft finally found it in Huludao Port. After the Naval Headquarters considered it as quickly as possible, it immediately entrusted the Air Force to deal with it. From the 15th, this sea patrol ship was first monitored by aircraft dispatched by the Air Force, and bombing of the ship began on the 18th. Since the total number of officers and soldiers on board was about 700, the Air Force first advised them to disembark. Some of them complied with the advice and disembarked, while others, with the assistance of the Communist army, used the ship's 24 anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns to fight against the air. In the bombing on the 18th, only one 1,000-pound bomb hit the ship's rear mast, causing the ship to emit thick smoke and a huge fire. On the 19th, the Air Force bombed it for the second time, and three large bombs hit the ship's deck, finally destroying the ship's oil storage tanks. According to the report of the last returning P-38 aircraft, the ship was already in a state of full-ship fire. In order to carry out the task of bombing the ship, Director Mao Yingchu of the Air Force personally flew to Qingdao to deploy and command. Commander Chen Jiashang of the Second Military Region personally drove a C-59 aircraft to command over Huludao, while the B-24 aircraft were led by Deputy Brigade Commander Hou Jie.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The rebel ship Huang An, which was heavily damaged by the Air Force in Lianyungang on the 15th, was continued to be bombed by Air Force aircraft today. The ship was completely destroyed, with three-quarters of the hull sunk in the sea, leaving only a small part of the bow above the water.</p>
<h3>Acting President Assists in Forming a Cabinet; Visited Various Parties in Shanghai Yesterday to Persuade Them; Also Discussed Economic Reform Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Acting President went to Shanghai on the 18th to assist in the work of forming a cabinet, in order to recruit new cabinet candidates and discuss economic reform issues. He has now completed his mission and returned to Nanjing from Shanghai by the special plane Tianxiong around 5:00 pm on the 19th. According to the responsibility of forming a cabinet, it should belong to Mr. He, but Mr. He has encountered difficulties in the past few days, and there are signs of stillbirth. Mr. He also frankly explained his difficulties to the Acting President. After consideration, the Acting President decided to call Mr. He at 4:30 pm on the 18th and decided to go to Shanghai in person to assist Mr. He. However, the Acting President refused to explain the mission to Shanghai to reporters. When the special plane Daxiong arrived in Beijing at 5:23 pm on the 19th, it was in the midst of a fierce storm. After he got off the plane, reporters asked him about inviting new cabinet candidates. He replied, "Forming a cabinet is the responsibility of the President of the Executive Yuan." When reporters asked about the mission to Shanghai, the Acting President only said, "Just for fun." He then took a car back to the Chuánhòugǎng residence.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Amidst the stillbirth of the new cabinet, Acting President Li suddenly arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the night before last, in a quiet manner, to contact various parties in a personal capacity to assist He Yingqin in forming a cabinet. The Acting President took the special plane Tianxiong back to the capital from Shanghai at 4:10 pm yesterday. During his stay in Shanghai, he was in a state of tense mobility and successively exchanged views with Xue Dubi, Mei YiQi, Hu Shi, Liu Gongyun, Xi Xuesui, Zhang Jiaxuan, Chen Guangfu, Zhang Junmai, etc. As of the time of his departure from Shanghai, the reactions of all parties were as follows: Although Mr. Xue Dubi was repeatedly urged by Mr. Li, he is still humbly declining the position of Deputy President. Mei YiQi also firmly refused to take the position of Minister of Education. Weng Wenhao and Hu Shi tried to persuade him to no avail, and Mr. Mei planned to go to Guangzhou in the coming days. Zhang Junmai also visited Acting President Li yesterday to discuss the issue of the Democratic Socialist Party joining the cabinet. However, according to reliable sources, Mr. Zhang personally resolutely opposed joining the cabinet. Not only did he not intend to be responsible for actual ministries, but he also believed that there was no need to serve as a political affairs committee member. The opinions within the party on joining the cabinet were extremely inconsistent. There were also strong advocates for participation, but without Mr. Zhang's consent, individual actions would not occur. The leaders of the Youth Party did not have contact with Acting President Li in Shanghai, but as of now, the Youth Party, at least on the surface, still adheres to the attitude of its declaration on the 18th regarding the issue of joining the cabinet. In addition to assisting He Yingqin in forming a cabinet, another mission of Mr. Li's visit to Shanghai was to discuss the reform of financial and economic issues with leaders of the financial community here. The Acting President personally visited Zhang Jiaxuan and Chen Guangfu at their residences yesterday morning for a secret talk lasting about three hours. According to relevant sources, both Zhang and Chen have no intention of participating in actual politics, so the talks were entirely about studying the nature of the problems. The highest-ranking officials in charge of finance and banking in the new cabinet will continue in their positions to maintain the consistency of policies.</p>
<p>Acting President Li was very busy after arriving in Shanghai. He had contact with Xue Dubi, Mei YiQi, and Hu Shi the night before last, urging Mr. Xue and Mr. Mei to join the new cabinet. Around 9:00 am yesterday morning, Mr. Li first went to Bóshí Road to visit Zhang Jiaxuan, and then went to Fukaissen Road to meet with Chen Guangfu, talking for up to three hours. According to Mr. Zhang Jiaxuan, Acting President Li urgently wanted to understand the local economic situation. The biggest economic problem at present is still the excessive financial expenditure. If you want to talk about improvement, it should still be after the establishment of the new cabinet. From 1:00 pm, Acting President Li met with Liu Gongyun, Ji Xuesui, and Zhang Junmai separately for discussions. At 4:10 pm, Acting President Li took the special plane Tianxiong back to Beijing with Weng Wenhao, Liu Gongyun, Cheng Siyuan and others.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Hang Liwu visited Acting President Li yesterday afternoon at 1:00 pm for discussions. Relevant sources revealed that the most difficult cabinet members in the new cabinet are those in the three departments of Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and Education, and no decisions have been made yet. Among them, the Department of Education is particularly difficult due to the shortage of funds and the complexity of the problems. There is also a lack of ideal candidates to fill the position, so people such as Mei YiQi and Wu Yifang have firmly declined to take the position. Hang Liwu is also a possible candidate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou Dispatch, 19th] Well-informed sources said today that the new President of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin, has telegraphed Wu Tiecheng to continue serving as the Deputy President.</p>
<h3>Personnel Selection for Minister of Internal Affairs Faces Hesitation; New Personnel and New Attacks in the New Cabinet May Be Difficult to Realize</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] With the assistance of Acting President Li, the selection of personnel for He's cabinet made progress on the evening of the 19th, but the complete list, which was originally scheduled to be finalized on the evening of the 19th, has not yet been announced. He first invited Weng Wenhao, Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Wu Zhongxin, and Huang Shaogu, who had returned from Shanghai, to a meeting at 6:00 pm on the evening of the 19th. Weng reported on the negotiations in Shanghai and continued to study the personnel arrangements in detail. At 8:30 pm, the Acting President personally went to Doujizha to participate in the meeting, and left around 9:00 pm. It is learned that the most difficult personnel choice in the new cabinet is actually the Minister of Internal Affairs. Initially, Xue Dubi, who is honest and currently practicing law in Shanghai, was intended, but Xue did not agree. There was also talk of inviting Li Hanhun, but then it was changed again to have Huang Shaogu, who had already been decided as Secretary-General, become the Minister of Internal Affairs. However, it was changed again on the 19th, with Huang still serving as Secretary-General. The position of Minister of Internal Affairs was then to persuade Xue Dubi to serve concurrently as Deputy President, but Xue's consent has not yet been obtained. Secondly, it has been generally decided that the Minister of Economic Affairs will be Sun Yueqi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is expected to be Chuan Bingchang, and the Minister of Transportation will continue to invite Xu Zuofu to take office. He will concurrently serve as the Minister of National Defense, and Hang Liwu is generally likely to be the Minister of Education. According to the latest news, if Xue firmly refuses, Jia Jingde will be invited to serve as Deputy President, and Li Hanhun may be the Minister of Internal Affairs. It is also learned that Xu Kan sent a letter to He on the 19th to resign from the position of Minister of Finance, so there is one more vacancy in the cabinet list. Also, if this list can be decided within days, in terms of party affairs, all Kuomintang members will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for approval by the Political Council. In terms of administrative procedures, the President will nominate them, so the announcement period still needs to wait one or two days. Up to now, most people are waiting for the good news of the new cabinet with great patience, but the constant news of rejections makes everyone fear that the new cabinet will be difficult for new people. The new policy of performance.</p>

The ship was completely destroyed by the Air Force in a follow up attack on March 19th, and three-quarters of the hull has sunk into the sea (the white arrow points to the location).</p>
<h3>Guo Dejie Arrives in Beijing from Guilin; Shares Shaddock with Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Acting President's wife, Guo Dejie, flew to Beijing from Guilin by special plane at 3:00 pm on the 19th. Guo got off the plane in the pouring rain, and there were many people who came to meet her, but Guo could not find her husband in the crowd. After reporters told her that he had not returned yet, she suddenly realized and asked where he had gone. The reporters told her that he would be back from Shanghai in an hour. The lady smiled and got in the car. Also, the lady's special plane carried many baskets of Guangxi shaddock, and the reporters shared two of them on the spot.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li; Telegraphs Northwest Officials; To Come to Beijing to Discuss National Affairs; Yu Hanmou and Xue Yue Fly to Beijing from Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Acting President Li recently telegraphed Northwest military and political officials separately to come to Beijing to discuss national affairs. The officials summoned include Bawurhan, Ma Bufang, Ma Hongda, Guo Jijiao, and Dong Zhao. They are expected to arrive in Beijing in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 19th] It is reported that Yu Hanmou and Xue Yue are scheduled to fly to Beijing on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Acting President Li hosted a banquet at the Presidential Palace at 7:00 pm on the evening of the 19th for military and political officials who arrived in Beijing, including Chen Cheng, Zhu Shaoliang, Wang Lingji, and Yang Sen, and Gu Zhutong, Zhou Zhirou, Gui Yongqing, Li Hanhun, Liu Jianqun, and Huang Shaogu accompanied them.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Matter of Raising the Price of Silver Dollars; The Control Yuan Dispatches Three Committees to Investigate Thoroughly</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] At the general meeting of the Control Yuan on the morning of the 19th, several members of the Control Yuan expressed their indignation upon seeing reports in the newspapers that the Central Bank had raised the price of silver dollars to 7,000 yuan per piece for sale, leading to the rise of gold banknotes and prices. They strongly advocated a thorough investigation. Seven members of the Control Yuan, including Hu Wenhui, Li Mengbiao, Liu Xingzhi, Ma Kongqun, Lu Fengge, Chen Darong, and Gesang Yuexi, proposed a temporary emergency motion stating: "It is hereby reported that today's newspapers reported that the National Bank decided on the 18th to raise the price of gold and silver, resulting in a sharp rise in prices. What is the intention? Personnel should be dispatched to the Ministry of Finance as soon as possible for inquiries and emergency corrections should be made. Is this feasible? Please make a public decision." After President Yu submitted it for discussion, Hu Wenhui briefly explained the proposal. There was no objection from the entire venue and it passed. Hu Wenhui, Tang Honglie, and He Jizhou were appointed as visiting committee members to conduct a thorough investigation. The three have scheduled to visit Finance Minister Xu Kan and National Bank President Liu Gongyun on the 20th to inquire about the truth.</p>
<h3>In Order to Defend Southern Henan and Eastern Hubei: Important Bridgeheads; The National Army Decides to Ensure Them with All Its Strength; Commander Zhang Zhen Leaves Wuhan and Returns to Xinyang</h3>
<p>[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 19th] According to military sources, the two corps of the Communist army, originally belonging to Liu Bocheng's forces, which pushed westward from northern Anhui via Zhengyangguan and Sanhejian, have mostly arrived in Shangcheng and Gushi in southern Henan, and joined Chen Geng's corps, which is heading south along the Xinhuang Highway, on the south bank of the Huai River. It is reported that as of the 18th, the total strength of the Communist army gathered in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui is more than 150,000, and the Communist army that has invaded the Macheng area of eastern Hubei is less than 20,000. The main force of the Communist army on the north bank of the Huai River has almost completely gone south, leaving only a few land-based Communists to contain them. According to an authoritative military source, the Communist army's current concentration of a large army in the above-mentioned areas has a very clear intention. If it is said that the Communist army in this corner can rely on its superior strength to go straight to the east bank of the Ye River and choose its attack focus between Xinshun, Xishui, Wuxue, and Tianjiazhen in order to cross the river, it seems too early. However, the threat to the Pinghan Railway and the flanks of Hankou should not be ignored. From his observation, the military will be able to ensure the important bridgeheads in southern Henan and eastern Hubei with all its strength, and the recovery of Macheng and Lishan is also a matter of time.</p>
<p>[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 19th] Zhang Zhen, Chairman of Henan and Commander of the Fifth Pacification Zone, returned here from Wuhan at noon on the 19th. He immediately convened a meeting of generals at the Pacification Zone headquarters and gave important instructions.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 19th] Zhang Zhen returned to Xinyang at 7:00 am on the 19th. During his visit to Wuhan, Zhang had several audiences with Commander-in-Chief Bai, to whom he made reports. It is said that Bai gave a comprehensive indication of the situation in southern Henan and future developments.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Strictly Prevent the Communist Army from Crossing the Yangtze River to the South; Jiangfang Headquarters Will Be Established; Amidst the Talk of Peace, the Situation is Full of the Possibility of Resuming War</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] In order to strictly prevent the Communist army from crossing the Yangtze River to the south, the authorities have recently planned to establish Jiangfang Headquarters to command the Navy, Army, and Air Force in the south of the Yangtze River in a unified manner to strengthen the original command structure. It is said that this organization can be implemented after being approved by the highest military authorities. In addition, the Ministry of National Defense held a high-level military conference at 9:00 am on the 19th. Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, Guo Qian, Lin Wei, Hou Teng and more than ten people attended, chaired by Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong. In addition to reporting on defense and listening to enemy intelligence reports, the discussion on how to prevent the Communist army from crossing the Yangtze River was particularly detailed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The political atmosphere in the Chinese government-controlled areas now seems more like war than peace. The undercurrent of concern for the future is beginning to gather beneath the surface of enthusiasm for a political solution with the Communists, although officials expect peace talks to begin soon and officials openly say they are optimistic about the future of peace. Qualified observers believe the current situation is fraught with the possibility of explosion. Peace talks are expected to begin but could break down at any time, and war could resume. In addition, if Acting President Li and President He cannot overcome opposition forces, internal political disputes within the government will deepen and the increasingly dire financial situation could worsen.</p>
<p>Current signs indicate that the tension that is beginning is sweeping across the calm surface. Recent returnees from previous withdrawals are said to be packing their bags again. Qualified observers believe the resurgence of tension is mainly due to the southward movement of Lin Biao's troops. In the eyes of the Chinese people, Lin Biao's troops are of greater importance than other Communist troops.</p>
<p>These recent developments in the war, as well as news regarding the CCP's administration of Beiping, are said to have made even those who were absolutely optimistic about peace doubt the possibility of a peaceful solution. According to a legislator who did not want his name to be published, the southward movement of Lin Biao's troops and the CCP's administration in Beiping have weakened the voice of those who advocate peace within the government and strengthened the calls of those who advocate war. Another legislator, who also did not want his name to be published, predicted the following timeline for the peace talks: The peace talks will begin in two weeks, last for two weeks, and then break down. He believes that the CCP, which has repeatedly won battles, is probably unwilling to bargain, but only to ask a yes or no answer.</p>
<h3>In the Narrow Area Near the Yangtze River Bank in Northern Jiangsu; The Communist Army is Intensifying Its Mobilization; The National Army Has Dispatched Warships to Patrol the Jiangyin Area</h3>

<h3>Sunday Forum: A Review and Prospectus of the Postal Service</h3>
<p>— Wang Yuguang</p>
<p>— A Speech Commemorating the 53rd Anniversary of the Republic of China Postal Service —</p>
<p>Confucius said, "The spread of virtue is faster than delivering messages by post." According to the Zengyun dictionary, "Ma Zhuan is called Zhi, Bu Zhuan is called You," these were two ancient methods of delivering official documents, equivalent to the current postal service. The analogy must be popular, which shows that in the minds of ordinary people at that time, the postal service must have been extremely fast. Otherwise, Confucius would not have cited this as an example. In modern times, post offices replaced the old courier stations, transforming from imperial official stations to civilian post offices. The scope of jurisdiction became wider, and the matters handled became more complex. In terms of speed, it has indeed surpassed the past, but in terms of difficulties, it has also far exceeded the past. The target of the postal service has changed, and its mission must also change and become heavier, which is very obvious. In order to adapt to this mission, the service goals have also been broadened. What is this broadening? It is: China has a vast territory and a large population. Since the postal service takes the public as its service target, it must strive to reach even remote areas. Therefore, in addition to "speed," it must also pursue "universality," this is one. The era of exclusive use of postal services for official documents has passed. The demand for postal services is increasing, but financial resources are limited. Sometimes, the transportation and receipt of mail are handled by others, so in the midst of "universality," we must strive for "security," this is one. The habit of "bureaucratic arrogance" has long been criticized, and the "cold faces behind copper railings" have also become a topic of conversation. In this century of the people, old ideas must be eliminated. Since the postal service takes the common people as the target of its development, it must take the lead in advocating respect for public opinion and thinking of the public in everything. If the strength is insufficient, make up for it with sincerity. Use a kind, thorough, and tireless "service spirit" to cultivate a good social atmosphere, this is three. The goals that the postal service promotes today are speed, universality, security, and service. The painful and difficult experience of the past fifty-three years has resulted in this understanding.</p>
<p>The postal reform measures of the past two or three years have been obvious. I will not repeat them here. Since last year, everything that has been done, such as strengthening airmail delivery, improving rural postal services, promoting insured registered mail, establishing public communication service stations for relocation, and restoring mail services between the Kuomintang and Communist areas, has been done in accordance with this goal. Although the environment has changed and obstacles have increased, as long as there is a bit of strength, do a bit of work; as long as there is a spark, emit a bit of light. "Plant melons and get melons," the effect is still there. Looking at this effect and analyzing it, we feel that there are four factors that can be listed:</p>
<p>First, the encouragement of public opinion and the love of the public. In the past year, public opinion has encouraged and urged the postal service, either in editorials or in special articles, expressing praise and criticism. Reports have been endless, publishing postal service Q&amp;As, publishing postal service news, and providing assistance in various ways to nurture this tender sprout. As for the public's suggestions to the postal service, they are particularly enthusiastic in the reply forms of the postal service's inquiries. Accepting public opinion and not blocking the channels of communication are the keys to success or failure in all things. Today, many of the postal service's new measures come from public suggestions. Street talk is worth collecting, let alone official suggestions. Meng Jin vigorously implemented this, this is a clear lesson.</p>
<p>Second, the assistance of transportation departments. Transportation is the lifeline of the postal service. Due to inherent shortcomings, the post office is unable to widely equip itself with transportation tools. Air transportation such as airplanes, land transportation such as trains and highway vehicles, and water transportation such as ships and civilian boats all rely on existing institutions. In the past few years, transportation agencies have paid special attention to the rapid delivery of mail, and have made indelible contributions to the postal service's voluntary completion of its tasks of speed, universality, safety, and service. Chinese society has always lacked a spirit of cooperation, so the cooperation and assistance given to the postal service by transportation agencies are particularly impressive.</p>
<p>Third, the excellence of the postal system. The excellence of the postal system is also one of the basic conditions for the postal service to achieve some success today. As is well known, the postal service is a neutral institution with international characteristics, and the reason for maintaining this tradition is due to the strictness and completeness of its system. The postal service has a perfect personnel system, a strict inspection system, and a meticulous accounting system. Recruitment must be through examination, promotion must comply with regulations, diligence and laziness are rewarded and punished, and the old and sick are given pensions. People are used to their full potential, and things are used to their full potential. In the handling of postal affairs, there is only system, no human relations; only career, no individual. Postal workers can serve with peace of mind because of this guarantee. Looking at today and reminiscing about the past, the painstaking efforts of the postal service's predecessors to revise and diligently maintain the system cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Fourth, the efforts of postal workers. Finally, we must also mention the efforts of postal workers. The backbone of a career lies in the system, and the flesh and blood of a career are filled with human power. Postal workers must pass examinations for recruitment, and their knowledge and skills are above the standard. In the past two or three years, in coordination with the implementation of new facilities, they have worked together to ensure success. In general, they can understand the mission of the times and the responsibilities they should bear for their lifelong careers. "Not to be served, but to serve," this is the motto of today's postal workers.</p>
<p>In a period of social transformation, the postal service, this neutral institution with international characteristics, is also facing the greatest difficulties in fifty-three years. We believe that with the love of the public for the postal service, the assistance of transportation agencies to the postal service, and the postal service's own perseverance and spirit of serving the public, it will overcome all difficulties and return to a smooth path.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Stop Conscription and Grain徵收 Under Review by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>A Committee Will Be Formed to Study a Thorough Reform of the Military Service System</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 19th] The Legislative Yuan began reviewing the proposal to quickly stop conscription and grain徵收 on the morning of the 19th. Due to time constraints, only the conscription portion was discussed. Some members opposed stopping conscription and grain徵收, and most advocated reforming the malpractices of conscription. The conclusion was to appoint seven members to be responsible for studying and drafting a thorough reform plan for the military service system based on the written and oral opinions of the members. Only a brief opinion was expressed on the grain徵收 portion, and the review was rescheduled for 9:00 a.m. on the 21st. When the meeting was held on the 19th, Yang Yifeng presided over the meeting. Representatives from the Military Service Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Food, and the Joint Logistics Headquarters attended the meeting to report and provide oral answers to some of the questions raised. Some questions were answered in writing. The specific opinions expressed by the members included reducing the conscription quota, adopting Yan Xishan's method of combining soldiers and civilians to select security forces, reorganizing local fugitive teams, incorporating captured and returned officers and soldiers, and recruiting vagrant soldiers and scattered braves to fill the source of soldiers.</p>
<p>Content of the Outline for Political Reform</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 19th] The outline for political reform drafted by the Legislative Yuan was severely criticized by the members at a symposium of the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 19th. Some members believed that the content of the outline was too complicated, had many loopholes, and repeated the provisions in the Constitution, which was tantamount to nonsense. It would be better to put in more effort to formulate a plan for the government to implement earnestly. The original drafters argued that the outline was drafted based on the opinions expressed by the members. If there was anything inappropriate, it could still be revised. It was decided to hold a subcommittee review meeting again on the 21st. The Legislative Yuan symposium on the 19th initially discussed the content of the joint meeting of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members on the 20th. Because some Legislative Yuan members advocated discussing political reform at the meeting, it involved the first draft of the outline for political reform. Although there were many speakers on the content of the meeting, no conclusion was reached. It was only decided to recommend Yu Youren as the chairman of the meeting. The first draft of the outline for political reform of the Legislative Yuan is as follows: (1) The Executive Yuan should be a responsible cabinet that lives up to its name and is effectively responsible to the Legislative Yuan. All policies and important measures must be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for resolution before implementation. (2) The central and local administrative agencies and state-owned enterprises should be consolidated and merged in accordance with the principle of strict austerity. The powers and responsibilities of each agency must be clearly defined, and the procedures and formalities for handling affairs should be simplified as much as possible. (3) Forcefully correct the malpractices of central centralization, and earnestly implement the system of balanced power. Local governments should not be interfered with by the central government in measures within their jurisdiction. The central government's business in the localities should be entrusted to the local governments as much as possible. The central and local fiscal revenue and expenditure systems should be strictly and rationally divided. The autonomy of provinces (cities), counties (cities), and Mongolian and Tibetan areas should be implemented quickly. (4) The size of the Ministry of National Defense should be reduced, the Joint Logistics Headquarters should be abolished, the number of national troops should be reduced, military officers and service personnel should be reduced to the minimum, military salaries should be strictly issued, military discipline should be strictly rectified, the personnel system should be reformed, and military orders should be unified. (5) Implement the recruitment of volunteers to supplement the inadequacy of the conscription system. The provisions in the Military Service Law regarding the methods of deferral and exemption should be revised immediately if they are unfair. The abuses arising from micro-soldiers should be strictly corrected. (6) All borrowing and requisitioning should be stopped, and the grain徵收 should be changed to gold yuan coupons or silver coins based on the value of the land, depending on the situation in each region. (7) Strictly enforce the collection of property taxes, investigate and freeze the capital of wealthy families and bureaucrats, and confiscate them in part or in full according to the severity of their illegal income. (8) The Central Bank should be directly under the Ministry of Finance. The China, Communications, and China Agricultural Banks, the China Trust and Savings Bureau, and the Central Cooperative Treasury should be consolidated and merged according to their business nature. The presiding personnel should be thoroughly replaced, the inventory should be thoroughly investigated, and the issuance and business should be strictly managed and supervised. Commercial banks should be strictly cracked down on. (9) The treatment of soldiers and civil and military public school personnel should be reasonably adjusted to ensure their family life. The treatment of employees of state-owned enterprises should not be particularly superior. (10) Implement the separation of civil and military affairs. Active-duty soldiers should not concurrently hold civil positions. The personnel system should be earnestly promoted in accordance with the law. Each agency should not privately recommend personnel. (11) Make proper arrangements for the relief of the unemployed and out-of-school students and the safety of refugee students. (12) Actively promote land reform to quickly achieve the goal of land to the tiller, and promote increased production of grain and cotton in different regions according to the suitability of soil and climate. (13) Dredge transportation to promote the exchange of goods between various parts of the country, and encourage and rationally guide import and export trade.</p>

His mother, son, and daughter-in-law Du Fen traveled with him. Wu Tiecheng, Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, Ouyang Ju, Duanmu Kai, and others went to the airport to see him off. In response to reporters' questions about the new cabinet, Zhang said that it was difficult to compile a list of cabinet members because Mr. He was a military man. Regarding the issue of peace and war, Zhang said: According to the current national army, regardless of quantity and quality, it is not impossible to fight the communist army. What is lacking is the organizational power between single teams. His words may refer to unity.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Chongqing on the 19th] Zhang Qun, together with his wife and mother-in-law, arrived in Chongqing from Guangzhou by special plane at 1:15 p.m. on the 19th.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Face Restrictions on Entering the United States; Overseas Chinese Leaders Are Launching Protests, Urging Amendments to Two Clauses in the Bill</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 18th] Local overseas Chinese leaders are launching overseas Chinese organizations in various cities along the Pacific to protest against two clauses in the Chinese Immigration Bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on the 1st of this month. In addition, the Chinese American Association (an organization of American citizens of Chinese descent) has sent letters to President Truman and leaders of both houses of Congress, urging them to pay attention to the harm that the bill will cause to their family interests. Furthermore, two local overseas Chinese leaders flew to Washington last week to personally appeal to the authorities. Overseas Chinese organizations have also launched a fundraising campaign to raise funds to cover the expenses. According to the original proposal submitted by Congressman Judd, the aim is to completely eliminate the traditional discrimination against Asian immigrants such as Japanese and Indonesian people entering the country. It is still remembered that the U.S. law restricting Chinese immigrants was abolished six years ago. Since then, the entry of overseas Chinese has been changed to a quota system. In 1946, a law was passed recognizing that the wives of American citizens of Chinese descent would not be subject to the above quota restrictions. Now that Judd's proposal is to eliminate racial discrimination against Asian immigrants, the restriction on the entry of overseas Chinese wives should be abolished. Therefore, the local overseas Chinese community only wants to amend the two clauses of the bill, and the provision in the 1946 law allowing the wives of American citizens of Chinese descent to enter the country without being subject to quota restrictions should continue to be implemented.</p>

There is definitely no political background or other political motives. Since Chairman Cheng returned to his post from Beijing, after investigating the full facts of the matter, the relevant主管 civil and military officials in the local area have been rewarded and punished according to their merits and demerits.

The Ministry of National Defense has now issued the main points of the micro-soldier to improve military service. When he inspected Jiangsu, he found that senators had received letters from the Communist Party, which said that if you senators want to be spared from the communist army's liquidation struggle, you must call for five things: (1) Stop micro-soldier rations, (2) Stop building defensive fortifications, (3) Stop forming security teams, (4) Stop supplying military needs, and (5) Prohibit the arrest of political prisoners and release political prisoners.

<h3>Hankou Gradually Becoming a Dead City; Wounds from Wartime Not Yet Healed, Market Depressed; Riverside Mansion Gradually Collapsing, Overwhelmed by Nostalgia</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hankou, 19th] Hankou, formerly the industrial and commercial center of Central China, is gradually becoming a dead city. Devastated by the Japanese occupation during the Anti-Japanese War, bombed by American aircraft, and then hit by currency inflation, further impacted by the cessation of foreign shipping and the ongoing civil war, this city of 1.3 million residents has now become merely an administrative area, and the market is becoming increasingly depressed. The Hanyang Iron Works no longer exists. The factory was looted by the Japanese army, and even the factory buildings were dismantled, using the bricks and stones, and is now a pile of rubble. Only the remains of the steel furnaces remain. Today, the so-called industry consists only of four yarn factories. In 1944, American Superfortress bombers destroyed all the port's equipment, factories, and warehouses, leveling almost the entire former German and Japanese concessions. The former British concession was also heavily damaged. After this destruction, and due to the prohibition of foreign ships from sailing here, Hankou's shipping industry has decreased by three-quarters. In 1936, a total of 8.4 million tons of foreign ships entered and exited the port, and 7.3 million tons of Chinese ships. In 1946, only 22,000 tons of ocean-going vessels entered and exited, and 2 million tons of river steamers. The threat of the Communist army makes the ships even more desolate, as the China Navigation Company prefers to dock ships in Shanghai rather than sail upstream, where they risk being requisitioned by the government army. Before the war, there were more than 2,000 foreigners in Hankou; now there are only about 50 left. There are still several foreign firms dealing in cotton oil, tobacco, and agricultural products, maintaining small offices, but most have closed, with representatives guarding the company's assets, waiting for the successful conclusion of peace talks between the Nationalists and Communists. They hope that Hankou will one day occupy a position in China's revival. Hankou's riverside has now become a desolate road, with huge abandoned buildings and the remains of burned-out banks and warehouses gradually collapsing. No one thinks of repairing them. Hankou was once known as the "Chicago of the East." Reflecting on its past prosperity is truly overwhelming.</p>

<h3>Recognizing the North Atlantic Treaty as Aggressive; Moscow's Strong Reaction; Supporting the Paris "World Peace Congress"; Commander of Soviet Troops in Germany Summoned Home to Attend Military Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 19th] The international affairs commentator of the Soviet official newspaper Izvestia stated on the 19th that the North Atlantic Treaty is an "aggressive conspiracy against peace." He stated that this conspiracy "is most clearly expressed in the North Atlantic Treaty." Izvestia's reaction is similar to TASS's dispatch from Washington. The TASS dispatch stated that "the North Atlantic Treaty is generally regarded as the main tool of the aggressive policy of the Anglo-American ruling circles. This point became clear after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on January 29. The publication of the original text of the treaty fully confirms this assessment. The drafters of the treaty used false sentences, falsely claiming that they were fighting for peace and adhering to the United Nations Charter, in an attempt to conceal the obvious aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty. The treaty also directly endangers the United Nations. The original text of the treaty proves that it has a military and political nature, stipulating that the signatory countries unite their military forces to take joint military action and stipulating that appropriate military institutions be established for this purpose. It is particularly noteworthy that the treaty stipulates the military obligations of several countries, which are outside the scope of regional agreements, emphasizing its incompatibility with the United Nations Charter. The original text of the treaty makes people believe that its true purpose is to use certain countries by the Anglo-American reactionary circles as springboards and military bases to achieve their aggressive goals."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] Soviet newspapers today published a report on the "World Peace Congress" to be held in Paris next month by Britain, the United States, and other countries in a position of one and a half columns, while only a short telegram from TASS in Washington was published on the North Atlantic Treaty, totaling only 36 lines. The newspapers stated that the Paris Peace Congress shows the peaceful aspirations of the Soviet Union and progressive peoples everywhere.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] The publication of the North Atlantic Treaty heralds the beginning of one of the most dangerous aspects of the East-West diplomatic war. During this period, the Soviet Union will undoubtedly use various methods in addition to force to respond. Western diplomats predict that the Communist political organizations that penetrate every European country will instigate strikes, political demonstrations, and even riots. This "fifth column" activity will not be enough to trigger the mutual assistance clauses in the North Atlantic Treaty. According to the treaty, the Atlantic countries will not consult on dealing with this type of disruptive tactics unless this activity is sufficient to threaten national security. Therefore, the Soviet Union can not worry about its immediate consequences and will continue to strengthen the tactics it has always been good at using. The Soviet Union and Britain and France have signed a post-war cooperation treaty with a validity of 20 years, guaranteeing the Allied countries in the Eastern Hemisphere for peace work. The Soviet Union has already accused Britain and France of violating this treaty and may further declare the abandonment of this treaty, but this action will only have a psychological effect, because this type of treaty has long been unable to be implemented. French Foreign Minister Schuman said that the Atlantic Alliance does not affect the validity of the Franco-Soviet Treaty. At the same time, the British Foreign Office spokesperson also issued a similar statement on the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, but the Soviet Union will not be impressed by this. The Soviet Foreign Office stated on January 29 that the Atlantic Treaty would "trample" on the treaties between the Soviet Union and Britain and France. Western diplomats also fully accepted another statement from the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union must "carry out a more powerful struggle," but they do not believe that the Soviet Union wants war.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 18th] It was learned today that the commander of the Soviet forces in Germany, Sokolovsky, has left here and returned home to attend a military conference in Moscow. The conference is probably related to the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>
<h3>Acheson Broadcasts to the Nation, Elaborating on US Peace Goals; Declares Western Alliance Complies with UN Charter</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Acheson delivered a radio address to the nation tonight, explaining the characteristics of the proposed North Atlantic Treaty, claiming that its most important purpose is "peace and security." Acheson outlined the origins, provisions, and purposes of the proposed treaty. He said, "The United States government, as well as the governments that participate in this treaty with us, firmly believe that this treaty is a necessary measure, the purpose of which is to strengthen the United Nations, deter aggression, and create a sense of security. The latter is necessary for the world's restoration of economic and political health."</p>
<p>Acheson explained how efforts were made to ensure that the treaty was in strict conformity with the United Nations organization. He emphasized that the treaty countries were determined to fulfill it in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations. When tracing the origins of the treaty, he pointed out the obstructive tactics adopted by the Soviet Union within the United Nations, which hindered the United Nations' efforts to maintain peace. He also said that US policy "was formed with a specific purpose, namely, to resolve the major differences that have occurred between nations through peaceful means." Acheson also cited history to show to free countries that to achieve true peace, countries should not only constantly strive for this purpose, but also clearly express that "armed aggression will encounter rapid and effective collective defense action."</p>
<h3>Shaw Criticizes Treaty; Merely a Piece of Waste Paper</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] George Bernard Shaw told Agence France-Presse this morning that the Atlantic Treaty is just another piece of waste paper. He also said, "That's all I can tell you."</p>
<h3>Wallace Criticizes; Saying it will Lead to War</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 19th] Progressive Party leader Henry Wallace said here on the night of the 18th that the Atlantic Treaty is a heinous violation of the United Nations Charter. He also said that the treaty divides the world into two irreconcilable groups. Wallace called on Americans not to be influenced by the pacifist rhetoric of those who favor it, as it is only a cover action that leads directly to war.</p>
<h3>Western European Countries Unanimously Support</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] Western European countries today unanimously supported the North Atlantic Defense Treaty, recognizing it as the best defense line to deter war and communism, and praised the United States for promoting the treaty. The Communist Party, on the other hand, shouted, accusing the signatories as "war mongers." According to the British Foreign Office spokesperson, at least the United States, Canada, Norway, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg are participating in the signing. This move will unite 250 million people and represent the majority of the world's industrial resources. At that time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin declared in the House of Commons, "The North Atlantic Treaty has created a new era of cooperation and understanding. All countries without aggressive ambitions do not need to fear and worry." Leaders of Western European governments also responded in droves. French Foreign Minister Schuman said at a press conference in Paris, "The North Atlantic Treaty provides France with a strong guarantee against aggression." Belgian Prime Minister Spaak said in Brussels, "The treaty is a major event in history, sufficient to reduce the possibility of war." Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker told reporters in The Hague, "This treaty is extremely important in the current world situation." Canadian Prime Minister Laurent also said that the Canadian people will fully support the treaty. According to a report from Oslo, the Norwegian Parliament is expected to approve the alliance this week.</p>
<h3>US to Implement New Military Lend-Lease Act; Western Europe and North America Re-arm; Atlantic Treaty Expected to be Quickly Approved by Congress</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Well-informed sources here say: The US government is willing to supply Atlantic Treaty member states in Europe with weapons and military equipment worth 3 to 5 billion yuan within 12 months after the Atlantic Treaty is approved. The new military lend-lease program will be an important part of the Atlantic Treaty organization. Continental military experts believe that Western European weapons are far inferior to the Soviet Union and its satellite groups. If the Soviet Union launches an offensive, Western Europe will have no ability to resist. Everyone knows that the Atlantic Treaty has no practical significance unless Western Europe and North America re-arm.</p>
<p>The true test of the Atlantic Treaty will only occur when all participating countries meet to discuss the collection of weapons and troops. At that stage, it will face two practical issues, namely (1) whether Western Europe will supply the majority of infantry; (2) whether the defense plan drafted by the Atlantic Treaty countries will mainly aim to stop the Soviet army east of the Rhine.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee leaders expect President Truman to urgently request early approval of the Atlantic Treaty. Committee Chairman Connally said he believes Truman will submit it to the Senate immediately after the participating countries sign the treaty on April 4. Connally has notified all members to prepare for expedited action on this issue. It is reported that Truman will, based on the advice of his diplomatic aides, request the Senate to approve the treaty as soon as possible, as they believe that tensions between the Soviet Union and the Western world will rise until the treaty officially takes effect. The Atlantic Treaty unites the eight Western democratic countries under a twenty-year mutual defense agreement. Other European countries, such as Italy, Denmark, Iceland, and Portugal, are also expected to join the treaty before it is formally signed. Congressional leaders generally believe that the treaty is a necessary warning to the Soviet Union and its satellites, making them hesitate and think twice before launching an aggression against Western Europe. However, some senators are concerned about the proposed arms plan. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman McKellar and the committee's leading Republican member, Bridges, both said they hope to know the cost of this plan before approving the treaty. Senator Young said that he is not very optimistic about the plan to supply Western European countries with arms. He is concerned that American-bound military equipment will eventually fall into the hands of any Communist aggressor. Senator McCarran said that he believes the treaty is a necessary defense measure in preparing for the inevitable war against the Soviet Union. He said, "I am sure that war will break out once the Soviet Union can manufacture atomic bombs."</p>
<h3>Willing to Devote Efforts to Economic Recovery; France Needs Peace; Schuman Says Joining the Treaty Ensures Security</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] French Defense Minister Ramadier broadcasted today that France needs peace, and France longs for peace from the bottom of its heart. Because without peace, there can be no freedom and democracy. After pointing out that outside attacks on France for aggression are insulting propaganda against France, Ramadier said that it is definitely not France that has more than two million troops and concentrates its troops on the border.</p>
<p>On the contrary, France has concentrated all its efforts on economic recovery and unhesitatingly reduced its troops. He also said that aggressive war and preventing aggressive war are not what the French people, the French parliament, and the French government want. France will faithfully abide by the Kellogg-Briand Pact, rejecting the use of war as an instrument of national policy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 18th] French Foreign Minister Schuman said at a press conference today that after the Atlantic Treaty is signed, its signatories will of course increase the production of arms. Due to the lack of an international army and the restrictions of the veto power, UN resolutions are equivalent to scraps of paper. The Atlantic Treaty does not violate the UN Charter, but rather complements the UN system. Schuman specifically pointed out that the Western Allies, trusting in their common victory and friendship in wartime, have restored their troops and adjudicated their armaments, while the Soviet Union and its vassals have not only maintained their military strength but have not reduced their armed forces. The expansion of the Soviet Union is no longer limited to Slavic lands. Due to its geographical location, France cannot allow itself to believe that it can be spared the threat of conflict.</p>
<h3>Churchill to Go to America</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Thousands of spectators cheered Churchill as he boarded the Queen Elizabeth today to go to New York. Churchill will give lecture tours in the United States and is scheduled to return to England on April 12.</p>
<h3>Britain Concerned about Independence and Integrity of Greece, Turkey, and Iran; Supporting Mediterranean Alliance; Soviet Newspaper Criticizes US Ambitions in Iran</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Foreign Secretary Bevin's emphasized statement in the House of Commons regarding the concern for the independence and integrity of countries such as Greece, Turkey, and Iran makes people believe that Britain will actively support the conclusion of the Mediterranean Pact to complement the Atlantic Pact. Diplomatic circles believe that Bevin's words must have been carefully considered in advance and are a major diplomatic policy statement by the British government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 18th] The Moscow "Labor Newspaper" published an editorial today stating that the US plan to turn Iran into its colony aims to prepare for a new war. Iran's seven-year plan is just a link in the plan of British and American imperialism to enslave Iran. Iranian reactionaries, taking advantage of the provocative attack on the Iranian king on February 4, launched terrorist actions against those who oppose British and American rule in Iran. The Iranian seven-year plan was indeed drafted by six American experts.</p>
<h3>Japanese Diet Opens; More Than Thirty Communist Party Members Refuse to Attend; Emperor Hirohito Reads Short Rescript as Usual</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Thirty-five Communist Party members of the Japanese House of Representatives refused to attend the opening ceremony of the 50th Diet on the 19th because Emperor Hirohito attended and presided over the ceremony. According to tradition, although the Japanese Emperor has been deprived of political privileges under the new constitution, he still reads a short rescript to the joint session of both houses, urging Diet members to cooperate to make Japan a peaceful and democratic country so that it can return to the international family again.</p>
<p>Japanese Communist leaders Tokuda, Nosaka, Shiga and eight other Communist Party members did not arrive at the Diet building. The remaining twenty-four appeared in the Diet building but did not participate in the opening ceremony. This is because the Japanese Communist Party opposes the preservation of the Emperor system, even though the Emperor has been deprived of political privileges. At the beginning of the occupation, the Japanese Communist Party demanded that Emperor Hirohito be tried as a senior war criminal. Hirohito said: He was deeply gratified to see the improvement in the living standards of the Japanese people and attributed this to the assistance of the Allied countries and the arduous efforts of the Japanese people. But he warned that the Japanese people must not stop these efforts but must continue to strive to correctly understand democratic principles and rebuild a self-sufficient economy. He emphasized that Japan must keep pace with the world "spiritually and materially." This Japanese Diet is facing many serious problems, especially how to implement MacArthur's nine-point economic stabilization plan and how to balance the budget. Although Yoshida's extremely conservative cabinet has an absolute majority in the Diet, due to the surge in the number of Japanese Communist Party seats, they will obviously do their best to put the cabinet in a difficult position.</p>
<h3>Yoshida to Visit Dodge to Discuss Budget Problems</h3>
<p>Diet Policy Address Postponed to the 26th</p>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch] Regarding the budget problem, the opinion of MacArthur Headquarters and the promise of the Liberal Party have always been in opposition. Ikeda shuttled back and forth, but no satisfactory result was achieved. It eventually became necessary to find a political solution. According to Mr. Ikeda, Prime Minister Yoshida, although ill, has now decided to personally negotiate with Economic Advisor Dodge of MacArthur Headquarters to seek a compromise on the budget issue.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Cabinet Secretary General Masuda notified the speakers of both houses of the Diet on the 19th that the Prime Minister's policy address is planned to be postponed to the 26th due to the delay in budget preparation.</p>
<h3>US Will Not Allow Japan to Be Sacrificed to Communism</h3>
<p>Speech by MacArthur Advisor Sebaugh</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch] MacArthur's political advisor, Sebaugh, said in a speech at St. Paul's University here today that the United States will not allow Japan to be sacrificed to communist incitement. The recent declarations by the communist parties of France, Italy, Britain, and Norway against participating in the anti-Soviet war are those of traitors to the nation and the family. Anti-communism must not only be stepped up with vigilance, but also promote democratic measures in all aspects.</p>
<h3>India and Pakistan Do Not Plan to Join the Pacific Pact</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 19th Dispatch] Local authorities have hinted that India will not join the Pacific Pact. Australia's statement on the Pacific Pact largely reflects only Australia's preliminary views. Well-informed sources believe that neither India nor Palestine intends to undertake military missions in the Pacific. It is reported that India is quite interested in starting anew in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<h3>Scope of the Atlantic Pact's Joint Defense Zone</h3>
<p>Includes a Population of 350 Million and an Area of 8.6 Million Square Miles</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th Dispatch] According to an explanation by the State Department, the core of the North Atlantic Joint Defense Treaty is the "armed attack" clause, which includes the following four situations: (1) An attack on the territory of any signatory country, including French Algeria in North Africa; (2) An attack on US, British, or French occupation forces in West Germany or Austria; (3) An attack on the affiliated islands of signatory countries in the North Atlantic; (4) An attack on the ships or aircraft of signatory countries in the North Atlantic. In addition, the land included in the North Atlantic Treaty covers approximately 8.6 million square miles, with a population of approximately 350 million. The land behind the Iron Curtain covers approximately 8.9 million square miles, with a population of approximately 295 million.</p>
<h3>Opinion of Most Japanese People</h3>
<p>The Atlantic Pact Will Cause War Because the Soviet Union Will Join the Arms Race</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Japanese newspapers on the 19th published the contents of the Atlantic Pact with the largest coverage. Many Japanese believe that the Atlantic Pact will cause World War III because the Soviet Union will interpret it as an aggressive pact and join the arms race. Senior Allied officials privately expressed satisfaction with the terms of the pact, but said, "Now, we need a Pacific Pact."</p>
<h3>Japanese Officials Say It Should Be Extended to the Far East</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 19th] Japanese officials and the public have expressed gratitude for the successful negotiation of the North Atlantic Treaty. Cabinet Secretary General Masuda said that he hopes the United States will promote peace and tranquility, not limited to the North Atlantic, and should extend it to the Far East in the future. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Shidehara, said: This alliance is excellent, no one can oppose it. Speaker of the Senate, Matsudaira, said: This treaty is the right path to safeguard world peace. Communist leader Noda said that this treaty seems to be an anti-communist measure, and the Communist Party is not yet prepared to issue a formal opinion.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Strength Between Eastern and Western Blocs</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th Dispatch] The combined manpower and resources of the twelve countries that have joined or will join the Atlantic Pact exceed those of the Soviet Union and its satellite states. The strength of the Western countries includes: (1) Manpower exceeding the Soviet system by approximately 15 percent. (2) Steel production capacity exceeding the Soviet system by more than three times. (3) Coal production exceeding the Soviet system by more than two times. (4) Oil production exceeding the Soviet system by eight times, not including production in Latin America, the Middle East, and the Far East. (5) Ocean shipping tonnage exceeding the Soviet system by 34 times. (6) Trucks, buses, and cars nearly 30 times more than the Soviet system. In terms of the number of armed forces, the Soviet bloc exceeds the Western bloc by 25 percent, but for accuracy, each should be compared according to the divisions that are equipped, trained, and ready for combat. These numbers are military secrets and cannot be known to the outside world. The foregoing estimate of resources does not include atomic bombs, the latest American B-36 bombers, and the 731 American warships currently in service in the Atlantic.</p>
<h3>Israel Asks Britain to Withdraw Troops from Transjordan</h3>
<p>Israel and Lebanon to Sign Armistice Agreement Soon</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 18th Dispatch] An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Israeli representatives holding armistice agreement talks with Transjordan on Rhodes have demanded the complete withdrawal or a substantial reduction of British troops stationed in Transjordan. Unless British troops withdraw, Israel will firmly demand a reduction of British troops stationed in Transjordan to be consistent with the disarmament quota agreed upon in the Rhodes negotiations. The Israeli spokesman also pointed out that the stationing of British troops in Transjordan hinders the progress of Israeli-Transjordanian negotiations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rhodes, 19th Dispatch] UN Palestine mediator Ralph Bunche announced today that Israel and Lebanon are expected to sign an armistice agreement within one or two days.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Helsinki, 19th Dispatch] Finland legally recognized the State of Israel yesterday.</p>

<h3>Soviet Zone of Berlin Implements Self-Defense Corps System</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 19th Dispatch] The Communist Party in the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin has now implemented a people's self-defense corps system. The system has many similarities to those implemented by Japan and Germany during the war.

<h3>Mayor's Desire to Resign Due to Fatigue Is Exceptionally Firm; Chen Liang Appointed Secretary-General of the Municipal Government; Handover Ceremony with Shen Zonglian Tomorrow; Chief of Protocol Resigns with Approval, Director of Civil Affairs Bureau Also Resigns</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Zonglian has requested to resign from Mayor Wu due to poor health and inability to withstand excessive fatigue. According to reliable sources, the Mayor approved the resignation yesterday. The vacancy will be filled by Chen Liang. Chen Liang is a native of Xianju, Zhejiang. He served as the Director of the Office of the Central Military Academy, the Director of the Quartermaster General's Office during the War of Resistance, and later as the Commander of the Deputy General Logistics Headquarters. He is currently the Director of the Ministry of Food. It is also learned that the handover ceremony between the old and new Secretaries-General of the Municipal Government will be held tomorrow morning. From the day after tomorrow, Secretary-General Shen will be recuperating at home. He told reporters yesterday that he would cease all activities and does not plan to leave Shanghai. Also, Zhang Peter, the Chief of Protocol of the Municipal Government, submitted his resignation to Mayor Wu yesterday, which was also approved. The vacancy will be filled by Liu Banye, the secretary of the department. Zhang will remain in his original posts as a Municipal Government Advisor and Director of the Confidential Office.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Since Mayor Wu expressed his firm intention to resign, the directors of the various bureaus of the Municipal Government have also expressed their fatigue. Following the resignations of Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Yu Shuping, Director of the Police Bureau, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau, and others have also submitted their resignations to Mayor Wu. It is reported that Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, also submitted his resignation to the Mayor yesterday, but it has not yet been approved by Wu.</p>
<p>It is learned that Mayor Wu's intention to resign is extremely firm this time and cannot be reversed by any personnel changes. There are many factors that prompted his resignation, and his health is also a factor. Wu contracted Burmese fever for more than a month and has not been cured. His hands and feet often feel cold every day, and he is easily fatigued. Doctors have advised him not to overwork.</p>
<p>When the President issued the New Year's Day message, Wu suggested to the President that the current situation should adopt a unified military and political system and firmly requested to resign from the post of mayor, but it was not approved by the President. Later, when Sun's cabinet took office, he repeatedly insisted on resigning, but it was delayed until now due to the lack of a suitable successor. However, Wu has expressed that this time's resignation must achieve its goal. Mayor Wu's intention to resign is so firm that many believe it will become a reality. The Mayor approved the resignation of Director Zhao Zengjue first, and then approved the resignations of Secretary-General Shen Zonglian and Department Chief Zhang Peter yesterday, which are obvious signs. These individuals are all close aides of the Mayor.</p>

One hundred people from 135 private shipping companies in the city attended.

<h3>Shanghai-Tianjin Wireless Telephone Users Are Crowded</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the resumption of postal and shipping services between the National and Communist areas, wireless telephone service between this city and Tianjin has also been restored. Users favor the convenience of telephones, and on the day of the trial call, the long-distance station of the Telecommunications Bureau received 96 inquiries or registered calls from users in one hour. It is estimated that if the number of registrations is accepted, there could be as many as four or five thousand calls per day. However, currently, only a maximum of 12 or 13 calls are made per day, only one-tenth of the previous amount, due to faulty equipment or poor management in Tianjin. The demand for calls to Peiping has decreased sharply in recent days, and more than a dozen calls can be made every day. As for the content of the calls, users are particularly cautious due to the different political regions on both sides, and are limited to inquiries and greetings. Occasionally, there are also business exchanges, but these are absolutely in the minority, because Shanghai and North China have not yet resumed trade, so there is no need to exchange business information.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau recently received an electricity order from the Ministry of Communications stating that from now on, for communist-controlled cities that have not yet been notified or have not yet made calls, after the technical problems of call notification and calling have been resolved, they should first report to the authorities, and can only proceed with call notification and calling after approval by the authorities.</p>

<h3>Fan Xuejun Gladly Accepts the "Queen's Crown"; Coronation to Be Held Again During Sakura Season; Immediate Charity Sale for Philanthropic Efforts</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The coronation ceremony for Fan Xuejun, the queen of Shanghai's ballad singing circles, which was originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon, was temporarily decided to be held at 11:00 AM due to the excessive number of admission tickets issued in advance, fearing that the influx of art fans would affect order. At the same time, the vice-queen Xu Xueyue and princess Zhang Lijun, who were also selected this time, were performing in other cities and could not make it in time. After further discussion by the "Coronation Ceremony Preparatory Committee," it was decided to change "coronation" to "crowning," and the crowning ceremony was hosted by Ding Baoying, the godmother of the crown presenter Fan Zhiji. As for the formal coronation ceremony, it is said that the committee has reached an agreement with the Shanghai Red Cross Mobile Clinic Business Committee and plans to jointly organize a charity fair on a selected date, inviting celebrities in the city to participate. At that time, Fan will be re-crowned, and the "Queen's Crown" will be sold on the spot, and the proceeds will be donated to the Red Cross as medical expenses. The location of the fair has been tentatively scheduled at the old site of the Lishi Society on Jingshenfu Road, and the time will be in early April, when the cherry blossoms there will be in full bloom.</p>
<p>Yesterday was gloomy all day. The "crowning" ceremony was held simply in a side hall of the Lido Garden. Because it was decided to keep it as secret as possible, there were very few art fans who knew about it and rushed to watch the ceremony. However, the famous artists Pan Boying, Jiang Yuequan, Xue Xiaoqing, Fan Xueping, and others still gathered on time, and the Social Affairs Bureau also sent representatives to attend. The entire "Queen's Crown" is made of 14K gold and is said to be worth about two taels of gold.</p>

<h3>Refugee Representatives Sentenced for Fraudulently Obtaining Rice Tickets</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] More than 3,000 refugees from Anhui who have come to Shanghai for many years are scattered in eight places in the city, including Fuan Lane, Fumin Road, Manli Bridge, and South Railway Station. Upon hearing that food rations could be distributed, the refugees in each place separately elected Hou Minyi and the fugitive Hu Xianlou as representatives, and then the representatives elected Hu Jimin as the general representative to apply to the Municipal Food Distribution Committee for the distribution of refugee food. In May and June of last year, Hu received the refugee rice tickets for those two months and handed them over to representatives such as Hu Xianlou for distribution. The rice tickets for July, August, and September were distributed by the district office in conjunction with the police station, according to the list. However, Hu Jimin, intending to make money by taking advantage of the refugees' ignorance, claimed that applying for rice tickets incurred expenses for paper, pens, and transportation, and instructed representatives such as Hou Minyi to fraudulently obtain 30,000 to 50,000 Legal Tender or several rice tickets per month from each refugee, and then the representatives handed them over to Hu Jimin for shared use. Upon detection, it was sent to the Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday, Shao Renjie, a judge of the District Court, sentenced Hu Jimin and Hou Minyi to four months of imprisonment for continuous fraud. Hou Minyi received a two-year suspended sentence.</p>

The District Procuratorate has now completed the investigation and filed a public prosecution on charges of corruption. It is said that Shen and others were ordered to go to the No. 8 Pier of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at 2:00 PM on January 13 to inspect the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Voyage that arrived from Shantou. At that time, Chuan Arong, the third mate of the ship, was carrying luggage and took a detour to disembark from a sampan. Shen and others, suspecting his suspicious behavior, ordered Chuan to return to the ship and showed their credentials to conduct an inspection. Shen and others found 16 gold bars entrusted to him by his friend Zhou on Chuan's waist. Shen and others, seeing an opportunity to take advantage, conspired to defraud and falsely claimed that "carrying gold bars disrupts the financial system and should be confiscated according to law." They held onto the gold bars tightly and refused to return them. After Chuan pleaded repeatedly, Shen and others returned six bars. Chuan was intimidated by their power and dared not argue. Later, Shen and others found 40 silver dollars on Chuan, and also claimed that it was an illegal act and should be taken away, giving him a receipt and instructing him to go to the Maritime Inspection Office to claim them. After the incident, they took the gold and silver away. Later, Chuan asked his friend Zhou to report to the Police Department, which arrested Shen and others. To prevent Chuan from making false accusations, they also arrested him in the same case for investigation and prosecution.</p>

In August 1948, someone secretly reported the matter to the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, which found that the accounts were inconsistent and that the company was illegally operating in the following ways: (1) On January 31, 1947, under the guise of purchasing Wing On Spinning shares, the trust department issued two checks totaling over 40 million yuan, including check number 21461 for 32 million yuan, which was presented for exchange by Lichang Money Exchange, and deposited into the exchange's account number 263, Yuanxin Yongjin, which was actually the company purchasing gold from Yuanxin Yongjin. (2) The company's Class A current deposit accounts, Weicheng Company and Taiji, were found to be inconsistent.

(4) On June 16 and July 3, 1947, the company extended a blank loan of 2 billion yuan to Kaitai Xiang Kerosene Company. However, the Kaitai Xiang accounts did not record this transaction. (5) The company's securities section falsely established accounts under the names of Yu Chuanrong, Li Yijun, Chen Dingchang, Jiji, and Daoji to collect over-the-counter transaction fees and engage in over-the-counter trading.</p>

<h3>The Weidemai Road Murder Case: Elderly Single Woman Murdered; Body Buried Under Floorboards, Entire Body Decayed; Murderer Left a Note and Fled to Beiping; Motive Speculated to Be Related to Love Triangle</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The small Western-style house at 51 Ben Guo Street, Weidemai Road, Hudong, was previously enemy-puppet property. An elderly Henan woman, Xiong Wang, 48 years old, whose husband had passed away, lived there. She had two sons, the eldest named Shi Fang, who served as an adjutant in the 2nd Regiment of the Taiwan Air Force Ground Guard Group. The younger son, Yuanlin, worked as a technician in a military engineering team in Nanjing. Neither son was married, so only Mrs. Xiong lived in the Shanghai residence. Last month, Xiong Shifang sent a letter from Taiwan to his friend, Zhu Jianhua, asking him to take care of his mother. After receiving the letter, Zhu went to the above address but could not find her, so he left it at that. On the 20th of the same month, Xiong Yuanlin returned home from Nanjing but also did not see his mother. He inquired with the neighbors on the left and right, who all said that they had seen her go out yesterday and not return. After waiting overnight with no news, Yuanlin reported the matter to the Xinshijie Police Precinct, which dispatched police officers to investigate without success. The precinct then reported the matter to the General Bureau for record. Yesterday morning, Zhu returned to the address to look for the old woman and was surprised to see that the house had been sold, and the resident was Wu Senlin, a staff officer of the Air Transport Supply Team. He inquired with the people in Wu's house but still could not find her. As he was hesitating, he suddenly saw a letter on the table addressed to Xiong Shifang. He opened it and read it carefully and learned that Xiong's mother had been murdered, and her body was buried under the floorboards in the kitchen. The murderer claimed to be Jia Baogui. The letter stated: "Mr. Xiong, concerning the death of your mother, I indeed murdered her. The body is under the floorboards in the kitchen. You will understand when you see it. The reason for killing her was caused by your brother and Yuexia. If you want revenge, you can find your brother and Yuexia and kill them. That is the only way you can be both loyal and filial. Sorry to you, Jia Baogui. I have now gone to Beiping." The entire letter was written in pencil, and the postmark showed that it was mailed from Puzhen, Nanjing on March 11. After reading the letter, Zhu was extremely shocked and rushed to the Xinshijie Police Station to report the matter. The head of the precinct, Lu, ordered Liu Lianfang, the head of the Criminal Division, along with patrol officer Su Yongqing, police chief Zhao Bingyue, and police officers Zhu Bingjun and Luo Ziquan, to rush to the scene to investigate. After digging up the floorboards, they found a body. It was wearing a blue cloth cheongsam and bound-foot cotton pants. The entire body was decayed, covered in fine hair, and the face was difficult to recognize. The police officers removed the body and transported it to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for examination, while at the same time issuing a warrant for the arrest of the fugitive murderer. It is speculated that the motive for the crime is related to a love triangle. If the murderer has fled to the "liberated" area, it will be difficult to apprehend him for the time being.</p>

<h3>Changzhou Ancient Tomb: Secrets Initially Revealed; Experts Study Tomb Bricks and Conclude They Are Relics from the Three Kingdoms Period</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The recent discovery of an ancient tomb in the southern suburbs of Changzhou has caused a sensation. Yesterday, a reporter made a special trip to investigate and brought back a tomb brick that had been excavated, which was sent to Mr. Jiang Dayi, director of the Municipal Museum and professor at Tongji University, for identification. The brick has a pattern of ancient coins, but unfortunately, it is blurred due to careless washing. According to Mr. Jiang's observation, it may be the four characters "Da Qian Wu Bai" (Large Coin Five Hundred), which was a currency during the Sun Quan period of the Three Kingdoms. Also, the pattern on the brick is only printed on one side, not on all four sides, which was also common in the early Jin Dynasty of the Three Kingdoms. The bricks of the later Six Dynasties were smaller in size, so he concluded that this ancient tomb is most likely a relic from the Three Kingdoms period or slightly later. The ancient tomb was discovered at Yunjia Dun, near Qinglong Bridge, about one mile outside the South Gate of Changzhou. The area is surrounded by a flat plain, but next to Yunjia Village, there are three mounds rising, large in circumference and about several dozen feet high. The mounds are full of abandoned graves and have always been regarded as piles of ownerless yellow earth. Starting on the 10th of this month, the City Defense Unit constructed fortifications in the area, digging trenches several feet deep around the waists of the mounds. On the 15th, several laborers, while excavating on the south side of the largest mound, covering about seven or eight acres, suddenly discovered a wall made of huge bricks in the soil. Everyone was surprised, and after continuing to excavate and unearthing many bricks, they revealed a tomb door also built of bricks. Thus, the mysterious ancient tomb reappeared in the world.</p>
<p>Door Within a Door, Room Within a Room</p>
<p>That morning, they dug away the tomb door and discovered a hollow, empty chamber, about the height of a person with their hand raised, about six feet wide, and about five feet deep. Each of the three walls had a vaulted door, all sealed with bricks. It was clear that there was a door within a door, and a room within a room, and that the scale of this tomb was very large. In the first chamber that was excavated, several ancient coins and half of a broken sword were found on the ground, and there may have been several "figurines," but unfortunately, due to the gathering of nearby soldiers and civilians, these objects were taken away by unknown persons amidst the chaos, and even the tomb bricks were snatched away.</p>
<p>After the news spread, some people made far-fetched associations, saying that there were pearls and jewels in the tomb, and even celestial boys and girls, which suddenly drove the residents of the entire city of Changzhou crazy. Starting in the afternoon, curious citizens, old and young, flocked to see this ancient site. The Wuyi Avenue outside the South Gate was shoulder-to-shoulder, and Yunjia Dun was packed with people. However, the tomb passage and the doorway were very small, only allowing one or two people to crawl in and out, so most of the curious citizens could only look at it from afar, and the crops along the road were trampled and damaged, which angered the local farmers.</p>
<p>Crowds Obstruct Excavation</p>
<p>Such a crowded audience made it impossible to continue the excavation work. At the same time, the City Defense Unit and the County Government received reports that such a large ancient tomb must contain many cultural relics worthy of archaeological research and should not be excavated casually. Therefore, they sent armed soldiers to guard the site and convened gentry and merchants of the county to discuss the matter. It was decided to organize a committee to submit a report to the Ministry of Interior for approval and then formally excavate. During the construction period, visits will be prohibited to avoid hindering the work. Judging from the size of the tomb mound and the procedures required for formal excavation, it will probably take at least a month to reveal the secrets of the tomb.</p>
<p>The currently excavated tomb bricks are each over one foot and three inches long, over seven inches wide, and over two inches thick, weighing up to eighteen city catties. According to elderly villagers in Yunjia Village, during the Taiping Rebellion, these three mounds were used as campsites for the Taiping army. It is also said that during the first month of the lunar year, the 52nd Army stationed in Changzhou accidentally dug up tomb bricks. The villagers also obtained many of them, but they were not taken seriously at the time. Some were used to fill the ground, and some were sold as ordinary bricks and tiles.</p>
<p>The Place Name is Qinglong Township, Suspected to Be the Tomb of an Emperor</p>
<p>Some people believe that the large scale of the ancient tomb and the thickness of the tomb bricks suggest that it may be more than just the tomb of a famous minister or noble, and may even be the tomb of an emperor. Moreover, because the place name is Qinglong (Azure Dragon) Township and there is a Qinglong Bridge, it seems even more likely that it is the "Dragon" place. However, according to Professor Jiang Dayi, the custom of extravagant burials was prevalent during the Three Kingdoms period. At that time, people believed that after death, people should enjoy more as ghosts, and tombs were made as elaborate as possible. Therefore, even if the tomb is large, it does not necessarily have to be the tomb of an emperor or duke to enjoy this. He has also discovered Han tombs in Suzhou. Also, the current name of the tomb site is Yunjia Dun, and there was a person named Yang Yun during the Six Dynasties who offended the emperor and was executed by waist chop and his body was abandoned in the market. His clan members fled and changed their surname to Yun. However, this tomb may not be the tomb of Yang's ancestors, because according to historical records, Yang Yun was the most vehement opponent of extravagant burials at the time.</p>

<h3>Beiping Style (8)</h3>
<p>-- Jiang Xue</p>
<p>Report on a City Before and After "Local Peace"</p>
<p>I have returned to Shanghai from Beiping. After arriving in Shanghai, all I see are phenomena of infighting, division, corruption, and incompetence! I am very anxious about the current government's hope for reform! If the government cannot reform drastically and thoroughly, the possibility of the Communist Party controlling the whole country is very high!</p>
<p>The success of the CCP is not accidental. Although the soldiers in the People's Liberation Army are equally tired of war and want to escape, and the people in the liberated areas have many unspeakable hidden pains; the military development is too fast, and many crises and contradictions are also growing and expanding. But they have many success factors. According to the author's personal observation, the following points are significant advantages that contribute to the success of their revolutionary cause.</p>
<p>1.  The party's organization is strict and strong, and the party's will is unified and integrated. Hard work, service, research, learning, struggle, and sacrifice are the creeds of every Communist Party member. Although this includes many coercive elements, humans are animals with inertia. Without group training, it is not easy to become a firm and forward-moving member. The party is the decision-making body, designing, guiding, and supervising, but it is not responsible for the implementation tasks, and most of the people in power are not party members.</p>
<p>2.  The government has a strong controlling power and thoroughly implements the party's decisions. Pay attention to the interests of the majority and attack a few individuals. The government's grassroots organizations penetrate deep into the vast rural areas and can indeed control the countryside. Cadres at all levels are selected and have a spirit of humility, service, hard work, and diligence. Bureaucratic style and corrupt behavior cannot exist.</p>
<p>3.  There are no vacancies in the army, and strict and excellent discipline is a great guarantee of victory! The soldiers' treatment is not good. Each person only receives more than 3,000 yuan of Beihai currency per month, which, calculated at a ratio of ten to one, is equivalent to more than 300 gold yuan. The staple food is cornbread or millet, and the subsidy for non-staple food is not much either. But their discipline is very good! There is no formalism between their officers and soldiers. Soldiers are not required to follow any etiquette when they meet officers. Everyone sits together casually for meetings, discussions, and chats. Breaking down formalism is the basic work to eliminate bureaucratic style. Before and after each battle, they often hold meetings to discuss and review, and fully develop the spirit of initiative and initiative. Three cobblers are better than one Zhuge Liang, which is their key to respecting the opinions of soldiers.</p>
<p>4.  Not admitting mistakes is the most stupid act. Frankness, self-examination, and mutual criticism are the driving forces of progress. CCP members and cadres often maintain this spirit and fact. Humility and learning are the basic conditions for the success of a career, and the CCP also attaches special importance to these two points.</p>
<p>5.  Scientific and strict intelligence work is the main tool for the CCP to strengthen its political power. They attach great importance to this work and do it very well! For example, the liberation of Changchun was Miss Ma's first contribution, and Wu Huawen's defection in Jinan was also the result of this work. Similar facts are innumerable! No matter how much the CCP opposes the KMT's intelligence work, they not only have not abandoned it themselves, but are strengthening this work. However, their intelligence work is entirely guided by political interests and harms. It is never like those intelligence agents who protect personal interests and commit crimes.</p>
<p>In short, the CCP does have many advantages and success factors, which are by no means accidental, and there is no need to describe them in detail here. The future development of the situation depends on the strength of the opposing party.</p>
<p>The author believes that today's problem is not the achievements of peace talks, nor the merits and demerits of the CCP, but whether the government itself has a way to thoroughly reform. CCP cadres also openly admit that the rapid development of the military situation in the past six months has surprised them as well! This is not because the CCP has any great skills, but only because the KMT itself is too corrupt and incompetent.</p>
<p>If the KMT and the government want to save the situation today, they must reflect on themselves, wake up, and reform thoroughly. This kind of reform is not just a change in personnel, a reform on paper in official documents (such as the so-called high-profile land restriction policy, while the essence of bureaucratic politics does not change), or the amount of foreign aid that can take effect. It is necessary to fundamentally and thoroughly reform the system, style, cadres, and discipline effectively; and unite sincerely and work harder, and then there may be hope. As for those trivial, formal changes, not only are they not beneficial, but they can also have a contrary effect.</p>
<p>I left Beiping and returned to Shanghai. In the midst of this country's hope for peace and the active peace talks, I managed to introduce the situation in Beiping and the Beiping-style peace to readers, although the content is not very detailed, but it cannot be considered a meaningless thing. I hope that the government authorities can have a thorough and effective reform. I hope that the people who are working hard for peace can cherish the country. I also hope that the real and permanent peace of the whole country can be realized soon, then the common people will be blessed! (March 12, in Shanghai)</p>
<h3>National Highway Bridge Pinnacle: Baoji Wei River Bridge Under Construction</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Song Lin</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 14th Dispatch] The Sichuan-Shaanxi traffic route, passing through Guangyuan and Hanzhong-Shuangshipu to reach Baoji, relies entirely on highways. From Baoji to Xi'an, besides the railway, there is also a highway for supplementary travel. Before the war of resistance, the import and export of materials in the Northwest were all transported along the Jing-Hu and Longhai Railways to Xi'an, and then distributed to various provinces by highway. During the war of resistance, the Longhai Railway was interrupted, and Beijing and Shanghai fell. The capital was moved to the mountain city of Chongqing, and the transportation of materials in the Northwest relied only on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway.</p>
<p>The Wei River flows through the south of Baoji City. Before the war of resistance, people crossed it using wooden boats, which was not only time-consuming but also troublesome. In the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1937], the first wooden bridge was built, with 65 spans, 450 meters long, and could only accommodate one vehicle at a time. People called it the "Old Bridge". During the war of resistance, military transportation was frequent, and the second wooden bridge was built downstream of the "Old Bridge" in the 28th year [i.e. 1939]. That bridge had 103 spans, totaling 560.5 meters in length. People called it the "Military Bridge". As the years went by, these two wooden bridges gradually decayed. Every time the rainy season brought rising waters, they were often partially washed away. They were repaired as soon as they were damaged, barely bearing the arduous mission.</p>
<p>Bridge Construction Plan Launched</p>
<p>In the 28th year [i.e. 1939], the Ministry of Communications had a plan to build a permanent bridge over the Wei River in Baoji, but it was shelved due to the country's financial difficulties. On August 12th of the previous year, a large section of the northern end of the "Military Bridge" was washed away. At the same time, other parts of the bridge were also unable to bear the load due to the decay of the wood. The bridge was then abandoned. At that time, the transportation line across the Wei River only relied on the decade-old "Old Bridge," which was already beyond its service life. However, it was really difficult for it to cope, so it was riddled with holes and often blocked. The 7th District Highway Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications planned to build a reinforced concrete bridge amid all difficulties. Last year, the central government, considering that if the "Old Bridge" was interrupted, and the Ping-Han and Longhai Railways were still unable to operate, the transportation between the Northwest and the Southwest/Southeast would inevitably be slow or even cut off, decided to build a new bridge separately.</p>
<p>New Bridge with 72 Spans</p>
<p>The new bridge is a pure reinforced concrete structure, 576 meters long, divided into 72 spans, each 8 meters long, supported by pile foundations. The bridge deck allows two cars to travel side by side, with a lane width of 6 meters, and sidewalks on both sides, each 1 meter wide. The entire design is a continuous beam slab type, with every four spans as a group, leaving an expansion joint. There are 18 groups in the entire bridge, and the bottom of the beam is parabolic.</p>
<p>The principle of bridge and any other engineering design must be to seek safety, applicability, economy, and beauty. The design of the new Baoji Wei River Bridge also follows this principle. Its load capacity is for continuously passing 15-ton trucks. The Wei River channel is wide and flat, and the thickness of the gravel layer at the riverbed is unpredictable. Therefore, the bridge foundation project is most economical by using concrete piles. Furthermore, due to the continuous beam design, it not only saves materials, but also forms a whole in appearance, rich in simple linear beauty, giving people a strong impression.</p>
<p>Additional Protection Works</p>
<p>The Wei River riverbed is flat and wide, and the main stream shifts from south to north, constantly changing. During the dry season, there are only two or three small pools of water, none of which exceed a few dozen meters. But when the water rises, it is four or five hundred meters wide. In recent years, there are signs of erosion on the north bank, while the south bank is relatively firm. Both bridge abutments are protected by reinforced concrete herringbone earth retaining walls, and stones are filled in cement barrels along both wings. In addition, protection works are built upstream on both banks to strengthen the riverbanks.</p>
<p>The road at the bridge end has a width of 17.5 meters, and is connected to the original roadbed with a gently curved lane. A 2.5-meter-wide lawn is opened in the center of the road as a dividing line for the traffic flow in both directions. Some flowers are planned to be planted on the lawn. Two parks are also built on the side of the road on the south side. When the grass is long, the flowers are fragrant, and the trees provide shade in the future, it will not only increase the interest of the passengers to look out of the window, but also add a leisure place to the noisy and dry Baoji.</p>
<p>Formal Construction Process</p>
<p>The formal construction of the Baoji Wei River Bridge began in October last year. As early as March of last year, the 7th District Highway Bureau purchased, transported, and stored materials, and established a bridge construction office to start the pile casting project. In late April, the communist army disturbed Baoji. Although it was only a few days, the order was not restored immediately, causing the project to be suspended for several months. The main building materials, such as 5,000 barrels of cement and 400 tons of steel bars, all had to be purchased and transported from Chongqing. During this event, the transportation work was naturally also delayed. The pile driving work in the deep-water section, which was originally planned to be completed before the rainy season, could not be carried out according to the original plan. In September last year, Mr. Wu Huafu took over as the head of the 7th District Highway Bureau. In order to quickly complete this important and great project, he established an engineering office and officially started work in October last year.</p>
<p>Open to Traffic Next Month</p>
<p>In late October, the concrete casting of the bridge deck began. At the beginning of January this year, the casting work had to be suspended due to the cold weather, but other work that was not affected by the weather continued. After February, the weather in Guanzhong warmed up, and the casting work was resumed. With the tireless efforts of all employees day and night, more than 80% of the bridge deck project has been completed. The roadbed and protection works at the bridge end are being rushed. If there are no accidents, it can be officially opened to traffic in the middle of next month.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Delay of the Project</p>
<p>In the situation of turbulent times and soaring prices, the difficulties encountered in the bridge construction project came one after another: First, Baoji is a small place, and the contracting project had to seek the consent of the auditing authority before adopting the bidding method of various construction companies at any time to cooperate with the construction procedures. Second, it was not easy to recruit technical employees. It was neither possible to recruit from afar, nor did it take a long time to train locally. But finally, under the principle of training while constructing, the supervisors dared not have the slightest negligence. Carpenters were especially lacking. Even if all the local carpenters were hired, it would not be enough to allocate. In addition, various places were rushing to build national defense projects, which also gave the project no small resistance. When the work was being rushed a few days ago, the local military police checked the identity cards, and batches of migrant workers without identity cards were detained. The original plan to complete the project this month had to be extended.</p>
<p>The most important tool for building a bridge is a pile driver, in order to obtain a solid foundation. However, it was impossible to find a pile driver in the Northwest. Therefore, the 7th District Highway Bureau designed a pile driver itself, using the engine of a car to drive a rotating drum to lift a two-ton pile hammer. When it rose to the specified height, the hammer separated from the hook and hit the pile at high speed, which was quite effective. Two such pile drivers were manufactured and put into operation. Other materials such as cement, wood, steel wire, lead wire, and wire nails, except for wood which still needed to be purchased sporadically, all depended on Chongqing.</p>
<p>Total Cost of Materials and Labor</p>
<p>Speaking of the project cost, 2 billion legal tender was allocated at the beginning to purchase the main materials. At a time when the currency system was increasingly devalued, the project cost approved by the central government often became disconnected from the needs of the project. In September last year, the 7th District Highway Bureau, in view of the urgent timing, had to continue to rush to complete the project. While adjusting the budget at any time according to the price fluctuations, it also pieced together the funds for other minor projects and concentrated its efforts to carry out the project, so that it could be carried out smoothly to the present without interruption.</p>
<p>In total, the Baoji Wei River Bridge project cost approximately 10 million gold yuan from the start to the completion. If all the labor and materials are converted to the current market price, it should be 1.4 billion gold yuan, or 700,000 silver dollars.</p>
<p>The direct or indirect effect of this road connecting the five northwestern provinces and the three southwestern provinces to the Central Plains is unimaginable. At present, the scourge of war is spreading everywhere, and the Northwest is committed to the construction of great projects, which is worth our excitement.</p>

<h3>Shenbao Discloses the Disappearance of Two Girls: Danyang Station Quickly Finds Them and Sends Them to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Adopters Firmly Refuse Payment, Both Families Willing to Become Adoptive Relatives</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang Longyun, an employee of the Youning Pharmaceutical Factory in this city, brought two girls from Zhenjiang to Shanghai by car a month ago. Readers Sun and Zhong from Danyang wrote to inform us that the two children are now in Danyang, but the exact address is still to be investigated. After receiving the notification letter, this column was about to telegraph Danyang Station for inquiry when Mr. Wang also received a telegram from Chief Qian of the Judicial Section of the North Station Police Department in this city, saying that the two children had arrived in Shanghai. At that time, Mr. Wang was raising 50,000 yuan from the factory to go to Danyang to find them. After receiving the telegram, he was overjoyed and drove to the North Station Police Department. The two daughters were also very happy to see their father. This time, the family was reunited and enjoyed the joy of family affection.</p>
<p>It turned out that after the two girls were separated from their mother that day, they were escorted off the bus by the tea servant. The two children, one large and one small, were kept in the homes of station attendants Wan Aoshun and Xu Baishun of Danyang Station, for nearly a month. After this newspaper published the search notice, Wan and Xu learned that the two children belonged to Mr. Wang. The wives of the two men personally escorted them to Shanghai, accompanied by Zhao Wenhan, a plainclothes police officer from Danyang Station. After Mr. Wang and his daughters were reunited, the wives of Wan and Xu expressed their willingness to adopt the two girls as goddaughters, as a memento of their chance encounter. Mr. Wang accepted the kindness. Before parting, Mr. Wang insisted that the two ladies and Mr. Zhao accept the reward, but they all politely declined. As a result, they only accepted 30,000 yuan for travel expenses and happily said goodbye. The social service department of this newspaper has done its best this time, and has unexpectedly achieved a rapid and accurate effect. In the future, we should work harder to serve the society and fulfill the duty of a journalist. (The picture shows Mr. Wang's wife and two daughters taken on the roof of this museum.

<h3>Central Bank President Liu States: Cash Shortage Can Be Resolved Next Week. Yesterday, the Central Bank Still Issued Silver Dollars at 20% for Deposits of Fellow Banks</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Central Bank President Liu Gongyun flew to Beijing on the "Zhuiyun" special plane with Acting President Li at 4:10 p.m. yesterday. Before leaving, Mr. Liu told reporters: The current cash shortage will definitely be resolved next Monday. As for how to solve it, Mr. Liu was in a hurry to board the plane and did not explain.</p>
<p>Later, according to a confidential staff member of the National Bank, the formation of the cash shortage was due to the salary payment period last week. At the same time, the National Treasury had a large sum of military funds allocated, and the discount rates in various places were also higher than in Shanghai. Now that the salary payment period has passed and the military funds have been disbursed one after another, and the discount rates in various places, with the continuous outflow of cash, have gradually become stable. Most of the cash will eventually flow back to Shanghai. At the same time, the cash supply of the National Bank can also be gradually normalized. With this factor, the cash panic is expected to disappear naturally. Therefore, it is expected that from next week, the supply and demand of cash will be brought into line.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The cash panic did not improve yesterday. The business authorities of the Central Bank yesterday convened a meeting of responsible persons from various commercial banks and firms to negotiate that the National Bank would generally issue silver dollars to fellow banks yesterday, based on 20% of the balance of deposits every other day. The price of each silver dollar was still 7,000 yuan, with the aim of supplying silver dollars to the market through various banks and firms. It is estimated that about 200,000 silver dollars were issued yesterday, still in various types of silver dollars. The silver dollars received by some banks and firms were mixed with Spanish silver dollars, Japanese silver dollars, and silver dollars that were not circulating on the market, but the number was small, and the National Bank allowed them to be exchanged. The market price of silver dollars stabilized immediately.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Weaken</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The gold market turned weak yesterday, with a lack of momentum. After the Central Bank sold off the day before yesterday, the loosening of funds eased slightly yesterday, and the underground interest rate rose suddenly. Early in the morning, it was heard that the Central Bank would continue to sell off, and people's hearts were extremely soft. Furthermore, because it was Saturday, the multi-party was burdened with too much interest, and the intention to sell was very urgent. New short positions continued to be thrown out, and sales on the table were frequent, and the market was weak all the way. Because of the overnight weakness in the morning, people's hearts were scattered, and the opening was at 485,490. After the opening, the short positions saw profits, and the multi-party held up the market. The market was flat with a slight downward trend, rising slightly to 490,493. After the high, scattered long positions sold out, falling to 487,490. After the low, scattered short positions covered again, and it rose again to 490,493. Afterwards, the multi-party pulled up the market, exerting pressure. The supply and demand on the table were still balanced, and there was no stimulation from outside the industry. It hovered around 490 all the way. Subsequently, bad news spread frequently, and the people in the gold market were like frightened birds. Furthermore, because the underground interest rate was as high as 75,780 yuan, the selling wind on the table suddenly rose, and the market showed weakness, and the market gradually declined, seeing 480,483. After the low, all parties took advantage of the low price and thought of entering, and it rose again to 487,490. However, the overall situation was still not good, and most people were pessimistic. There were too many short positions in the market, and the market fell sharply again, falling to 478,481. Near noon, the struggle between the long and short positions was over, and it closed at 479,482 at noon. There was no large-scale transaction in the afternoon on Saturday, but because of the decline in the previous market, there was still some opening. The initial opening for Monday's position was 530,540. Afterwards, it was rumored that the gold yuan currency system would be changed to silver yuan notes, so people's hearts were slightly shaken, and the bid price rose again, and it finally closed at 537,540 in the evening.</p>

<h3>Old Debts of Four Foreign Currencies Exchanged for US Dollar Bonds</h3>
<p>Implemented After Legislative Procedures Are Completed</p>
<p>The government's old foreign currency bonds, namely, the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938] gold public bonds, British and American gold bonds, the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940] construction gold public bonds, British and American gold bonds, the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e. 1942] Allied Victory US dollar public bonds, and the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1947] (US dollar) short-term treasury bills, a total of four types of bonds. The actual sales, and the principal and interest that have not matured and been repaid as of August 20 of the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1948], were originally stipulated at the beginning of the currency system reform to be exchanged for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1948] reorganized (gold yuan) public bonds according to the legal exchange rate (i.e. 4 gold yuan per US dollar), and the application registration was started by the managing banks and bureaus on October 1. Later, in order to improve credit, it was revised to exchange for the 38th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1949] reorganized US dollar public bonds according to the face value. This regulation on reorganizing US dollar public bonds has been submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the Executive Yuan for approval and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. Once the legislative procedures are completed and promulgated, the exchange can be implemented. It is heard that the difference between this public bond and the originally scheduled gold yuan public bond is: (1) The bond is denominated in US dollars, and the principal and interest will be paid in US dollars in the future. (2) This bond is scheduled to be issued on April 1 of the 38th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1949]. All the principal of the above four types of old foreign currency bonds that have not been repaid as of August 20 of the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1948], and the interest as of March 31 of the 38th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1949], will be combined and exchanged for this public bond for recovery. The Ministry of Finance has now telegraphed the Central Bank to notify the bondholders of the above-mentioned four types of old foreign currency bonds who have applied for registration with the managing banks and bureaus in accordance with the original method of exchanging for the 37th year reorganized public bonds to properly preserve the original temporary receipts, so that they can be recalculated and exchanged for the 38th year reorganized US dollar public bonds at that time. At the same time, it has ordered the managing banks and bureaus to investigate. If the holders of the original temporary receipts come to inquire about the exchange of bonds, the above situation should be explained in detail so that they can understand.</p>
<h3>Banks and Bureaus Continue to Dispense: Funds Are Becoming More Relaxed</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's funds showed a trend of initial stability followed by relaxation. When the market opened in the morning, various industries saw that the funds were already stable with a slight upward trend when exchanging every other day, so they raised the daily lending rates one after another, and settled at 75 yuan to 80 yuan. Floating long positions, fearing that the funds would be tighter again next week, also sold goods for cash lending, and the supply of funds in the market gradually relaxed. Near noon, the daily lending rate had returned to between 60 yuan and 70 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that some remittances had flowed out, and the financial authorities, in addition to issuing a small number of silver dollars, did not sell off gold, yarn, sugar, and other materials, continuing to show a dispensing trend. In the afternoon, the funds became more and more relaxed, and the daily lending rate also retreated to between 50 yuan and 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the state banks and bureaus still dispensed more than 790 million yuan. In the large exchange, various banks dispensed more than 830 million yuan, foreign firms dispensed more than 30 million yuan, and in the small exchange, various banks dispensed more than 130 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Cargo Owners Sell at High Prices: Rice Prices Soar. Special High Quality Japonica Rice Fiercely Knocks on the 60,000 Mark</h3>
<p>The rice market rose sharply as before. Because it was Saturday, the cargo owners increased prices to sell due to the interest rate of two days. The rice market prices all rose by 600 yuan. White Japonica early rice opened at 55,000 yuan, and special high quality Japonica rice approached the 60,000 mark. The rice price in the Nanshi market rose by 7,000 yuan at the opening and recovered by 1,000 yuan at the close, rising by 6,000 yuan. 5,613 dan of goods arrived at the two markets.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Reaching New Peaks: Because it was Saturday, the cargo owners increased prices to hold on to the goods with the interest rate of two days. As a result, soybean and vegetable oil rose by 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the market fluctuation was very small. Soybean oil closed at 217,000 yuan, and raw vegetable oil at 200,700 yuan. The price of raw oil rose sharply. Jittabug raw oil rose sharply by 40,000 yuan from 280,000 to finally knock on the 300,000 mark. Soybean cake rose by 2,300 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market is still firm. The reason is that the funds are stable, the rice price has risen sharply, and people's hearts are very high. In addition, due to the weekend interest rate, the cargo owners are very strong in increasing prices. Military Ship once knocked on the 20,000 mark, and Lao Che made a high of 21,000 yuan. Wheat bran sales were quite smooth, following the trend by more than 1,000 yuan. The large bag of Fufeng reached as high as 16,400 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>The rising trend is still fierce. Yellow soybeans are affected by the sharp rise in oil cake. The factories are making every effort to purchase them. Cart soybeans are again raised by half, creating a peak of 46,000 yuan. Shatou soybeans are bid at 43,000 yuan. Pinghu Du soybeans rose sharply by more than 20%. The supply of raw kernels is even scarcer, and they continue to rise. The price of corn rose too much the day before yesterday, and it has slightly eased yesterday.</p>
<h3>Market Walk: Looking at the Stand Patters</h3>
<p>During the time of wandering</p>
<p>What can be predicted</p>
<p>Looking at it from afar is too pessimistic</p>
<p>The ocean bubble will deflate</p>
<p>Yesterday's trend in each market was a state of wandering. It is time to wander.</p>
<p>The so-called "should" refers to the different situations of various industries, and each has different "shoulds."</p>
<p>Manufacturers rely on actual sales; the lack of actual sales is not something that has only happened now; but in the current situation, it is even more difficult to move forward.</p>
<p>Not only is there no hope for actual sales to improve temporarily, but there is also a major difficulty now. The high cost of electricity is something that no manufacturer can figure out a solution to.</p>
<p>If the current environment does not improve, then it can be predicted that the problem of layoffs may soon follow.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of the situation of the holders of goods, heavy interest is the head stick. Unless it is one's own funds. If you drag in your own funds, and then release interest after throwing them out, you can only say that you are greedy for immediate interests. If you calculate it a little further, you will inevitably suffer.</p>
<p>If you are burdened with heavy interest to hoard goods, the first thing to look at is his ability to borrow and repay debts. The second thing to look at is what he is hoarding?</p>
<p>People who can turn around funds, even if they eat high interest, can also transfer it in and out every day to break even. Then, with a base of five jiao of interest holding up the goods price, it will not be completely hopeless.</p>
<p>But in terms of the present, you can only earn interest for others, and you yourself bear the risk.</p>
<p>In recent years, although commodity trading has long been a football nature, it still has some foundation of actual sales.</p>
<p>Now it's different. Not to mention that there is a problem with sales to customers, even sales on the street are extremely rare. The increase in transportation costs makes it difficult for single-person businesses.</p>
<p>Therefore, the football that is now being kicked is already equivalent to an ocean bubble. An ocean bubble will deflate even if it is not punctured. The day when actual sales stagnate is the time to deflate. Then, if the ocean bubble can be thrown higher and higher at first, it will soon be thrown lower and lower and deflate.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of the situation of lenders, relying on the base of five jiao of daily interest seems to be somewhat stable compensation. But the situation of manufacturers is like that, and the situation of holders is like this. Unless there is no new funds joining in, then they can still survive in the borrowing and repayment of debts by ordinary people. But this premise is absolutely impossible. Therefore, today's black market interest is indeed higher than five jiao of daily interest; but there may be a day when the black market interest falls below the official interest.</p>
<p>At present, the only pillars that can support the market are probably gold, cash, and silver dollars. Although the storms in the rice market these two days have come as we expected, they are not without a saturation point.</p>
<p>Combining the above, the stock market is also not easy to improve.</p>
<p>However, these views are inevitably too early and too far; tomorrow, if there is a materialization of the gold and silver market, then in response to the surge in gold prices in Hong Kong in the past two days, the market may turn over.</p>
<h3>Four Mines Joint Office Adjusted Coal Prices Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The various grades of coal prices at the Four Mines Joint Office were adjusted again yesterday. The new price for foreign coal is 273.220 yuan per ton. The price for Keelung coal is 130.420 yuan per ton. The price for Kai Luo coal is 126.860 yuan per ton. The prices of other white coal, small white coal pieces, and Great Wall coal blocks remain unchanged.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A large amount of fuel for the power company continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Panamanian vessel "Karlit" and the Texaco Company manager arrived from the Persian Gulf with over 10,050 tons of diesel for the power company. It is scheduled to enter the port in the evening and moor at floating docks 31 and 32 for unloading. Additionally, the Russian vessel "Tibilisth," represented by Moutai Foreign Firm, is carrying 6,000 tons of coal from Vladivostok and is expected to arrive today, scheduled to dock at the Dongjiadu Central Wharf for unloading.

<h3>Wool Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The new vessel "Sydney Star," represented by Tianxiang Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai on its maiden voyage from Australia, carrying a large consignment of wool, totaling over 700 bales. It arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Sees Another Surge, Cloth Market Halts Rise and Falls Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton yarn saw another surge in price. Due to the adjustment of public utilities based on the cost of living index, factories could not withstand the opening price of 70,000 yuan. Around 10:00 AM, news spread that the price of gold notes was falling rapidly, and external speculation also encountered resistance. Morale plummeted, and speculators, lacking confidence, reduced prices to sell off their holdings. The price briefly fell to 68,000 yuan before recovering to 69,500 yuan at the midday close, a drop of 2,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Trumpet Brand and Great Double Dragon fine cloth each fell by an average of 3,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Hua Ji fell from 67,300 yuan, steadily declining to 64,800 yuan by the end of trading, a final decrease of 2,000 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Pi Ji rose by 500 yuan alone. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong dropped by 1,900 yuan. The remaining cloths all showed a weakening trend. After the close, there were reports of off-market fire sales, and the market continued to shrink. In the afternoon, Pi Ji traded at 72,000 yuan, but there were no transactions for Longtou.</p>
<h3>Fanliding Sales Active</h3>
<p>Fanliding woolen fabric sales have been picking up in the market recently. Both local and out-of-town customers have shown considerable interest. Plain Fanliding is more popular than striped patterns, and light beige is the most common color. Yesterday, first-grade goods from local factories were openly quoted at 36,000 yuan per yard for wholesale, second-grade goods at 32,500 yuan per yard, and third-grade goods at 26,700 yuan per yard. All transactions were on a next-day bill basis.</p>
<h3>Silk Weak</h3>
<p>The silk market turned weak yesterday. Credit was tight, and interest rates rose. News that the National Bank was selling gold and silver suggested that credit would continue to tighten. Morale turned soft, especially as it was Saturday, and traders were eager to close out their positions to avoid overnight interest charges.</p>
<p>At the opening, the 120 Bridge instant contract was at 2.1 million, and the next Monday contract was at 2.35 million. Selling pressure was strong after the opening, and actual demand was weak. The market declined to 2 million, and the midday close was 2.02 million. There was no trading in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange certificate market for raw silk continued to rise, and sentiment was bullish. However, due to weak gold prices and tight credit, bullish investors were selling and lending out their holdings, which was quite profitable. As a result, the market was mediocre. D-grade 78 evenness Japanese silk opened at 3.3 million. Sentiment was dismal after the opening, and supply exceeded demand. The asking price gradually decreased, and the midday close for the current day's contract was 3.1 million. There was no asking price in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The silk and satin market was flat and weak yesterday. Off-market gold prices declined slightly, and the prices of yarn and cloth remained stable. Credit was slightly tight, and sentiment was somewhat uneasy. American Asian quilt covers opened at 1.52 million, and there was an immediate attempt to push the price up, rising as high as 30,000 yuan. However, selling pressure increased, and new buyers were cautious. The market weakened, falling to 1.48 million. Before the close, retail investors continued to sell off their holdings, and the market continued to decline, ending at 1.46 million at the midday close. There was no trading in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Clearly Rising, Secretly Falling</h3>
<p>The sugar market was very weak yesterday. Sales were sluggish, credit was slightly tight, and buyers were cautious. On the surface, sellers were eager to sell at high prices, and all grades closed at lower prices at midday. Fourth-grade and half-grade sugar closed at 74,700 yuan at midday, with interest rates rising slightly by 2,700 yuan. Coarse granulated sugar rose by 500 yuan to 69,000 yuan. Most transactions were for loans due next Monday, and the prices of other grades were clearly rising but secretly falling.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Rapidly Advancing</h3>
<p>Since sellers felt that the supply of black and green tea was scarce, they were determined to hold on to their stocks. Although Jardine Matheson made an attempt to attack the market for Keemun black tea some time ago, it ultimately failed. However, recently, large dealers in stored green tea, such as Yongxing and Jinlong, also planned to attempt an attack. Whether they will succeed is still being planned. The market trend yesterday followed the external commodity market and advanced rapidly again. The trading of domestic tea was also not active, and the process was quietly strengthening, with prices gradually reaching new highs.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Sluggish</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A reporter recently learned from those familiar with the tung oil market that after the surge in tung oil prices continued to spread, the market yesterday, amidst the ongoing rise of external commodities, also followed the trend. However, the underlying strength appeared weak. This is because foreign market prices remain low, making exports increasingly difficult. At the same time, domestic sales have declined due to the excessive price increases, reducing purchasing power. If prices continue to rise unchecked, the future prospects are not optimistic.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank Carefully Plans to Promote Silk and Tea Loans</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Silk and tea are major export commodities for our country, generating considerable foreign exchange annually. After the victory, the China Farmers Bank was ordered to implement silk and tea loans, which have been quite effective in revitalizing the rural economy, encouraging production, concentrating resources, and promoting exports. Although the loan work this year has been affected by the current situation, efforts are still being made to promote it in order to maintain the rural economy. A detailed plan has been carefully prepared and submitted to the National Bank's discount committee for review. Once approved and implemented, the loan will reportedly be implemented on a fixed loan basis, using the foreign exchange transfer certificate price at that time as the standard.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stock Market Stable, Foreign Stocks Weak, Gold Bonds Show a Good Trend</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Chinese stock market was strong early, then weakened yesterday, with a slight rebound before the close. The off-market gold market was flat and weak, and speculative funds returned to the market. Furthermore, with consecutive days of declines, various investors considered entering the market at lower prices, so buying interest increased, and the market was strong in the first half of the day. In the middle of the day, as credit tightened and the spot commodity market uniformly reported declines, and there were reports that the Central Bank was selling silver dollars to contract the currency supply, the credit situation next Monday was bound to tighten. As a result, sentiment turned uneasy again, and a soft wind rose again on the surface. The market turned downward. Later, there was buying on dips, and prices stabilized. Yong Yarn opened in the morning with a high price of 6.9 yuan due to the buying sentiment from all parties. After the opening, short positions were covered, and the price rose to 7.1 yuan, 7.12 yuan. Overnight long positions were sold off, and the price fell to 7 yuan, 7.02 yuan. Yarn dealers bought in, and the price continued to rise to 7.1 yuan, 7.12 yuan. Enterprise dealers sold off, and the price fell slightly to 6.98 yuan, 7 yuan. Financial dealers turned from long to short, and the market trend hovered all the way at low levels, falling slightly to 6.66 yuan. Guangdong dealers worked hard to pull up the price on dips, and the price rose again to 6.78 yuan, 6.81 yuan. Finally, the price gradually rose to a peak of 7.15 yuan, 7.17 yuan. After the peak, securities dealers sold off aggressively, and the price fell slightly to 6.59 yuan, 6.62 yuan. Before the close, retail investors repeatedly bought in, and the market stabilized, closing at 6.8 yuan at midday.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks opened flat in the morning. Later, due to the stable and strong trend of Yong Yarn, sentiment was bullish, and buying interest surged. The midday close was flat and weak again. American Asian, Xinyi, Xinguang, and Jingfu all showed strength at one point after the opening. American Asian rose to 2.05 yuan, Xinyi to 1.7 yuan, Xinguang to 0.575 yuan, and Jingfu to 0.26 yuan. Qinxing to 0.345 yuan. The midday close was still weak. The other stocks that once reached their limit up included Jinglun, Xinhua Department Store, China Underwear, Zhabei Water and Electricity, Jingfu, and five other types. The total transaction volume for the day was 6.288 million shares.</p>
<p>The off-market for foreign stocks yesterday was weak due to reports of weakness in the Hong Kong market. The market lacked the strength to rise. Furthermore, due to slightly tight credit, short positions paid an extra day's interest, so selling pressure was very strong, and the market was weak. Yisha 14,100 yuan, 14,300 yuan. British Union quoted 19,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan. Asian 1.340 yuan, 1.360 yuan, a high of more than half a percent. Wheelock quoted 52,000, 55,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The gold public bond market trend was still high yesterday, opening at 245,000 for buying, then rising to 285,000 yuan. The midday close was 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Export Freight from Chongqing to Shanghai: China Trust Bureau Ordered to Underwrite War Risk Insurance</h3>
<p>[Report from the Transportation Control Committee] According to the Transportation Control Committee, our country's export products have always been dominated by agricultural and livestock products such as tung oil, tea, and pig bristles. The production areas of these goods are widely distributed in the interior, and in the past, the Yangtze River was used as the main artery for freight transportation to Shanghai for export. In the past six months, due to the current situation, Yangtze River transportation has been extremely difficult, not only are transportation fees high, but the risks are also great. Operators have retreated one after another, or have changed their routes south to Guangzhou, resulting in daily depletion of Shanghai's inventory and severely affecting exports. In view of this, the Transportation Control Committee is urgently seeking to resolve this difficulty and has also adopted opinions from various relevant parties, and has written to the relevant authorities to restore the war risk insurance for export freight in accordance with the precedents during the War of Resistance. This proposal has now been approved by the Ministry of Finance and has been entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau for handling. The underwriting conditions have been learned to be:</p>
<p>(1) Scope: Temporarily limited to the Yangtze River line from Chongqing to Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) Subject Matter: Limited to agricultural, industrial, and mineral products and all daily necessities for people's livelihoods. Military supplies, gold, silver, currency, and luxury goods are not included.</p>
<p>(3) Insurance Liability: Adopt the internationally used war risk insurance conditions of the Water Insurance Association.</p>
<p>The Transportation Control Committee has already sent separate letters to the relevant export trade associations for notification. If the war situation can be temporarily stabilized in the future, the opening of this war risk insurance business is expected to make a considerable contribution to Shanghai's export trade.</p>

<h3>Mayoral Cup New Champion: Results Today - Railway vs. China Aviation Final at Yiyuan This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Last week's Mayoral Cup final was postponed due to spring rain and rescheduled for 3:00 PM today at Yiyuan. The new champion of this year's Mayoral Cup will be determined today. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Railway and China Aviation to compete for the cup.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu will attend the match to kick off and present the awards. The champion team will receive a silver cup from Mayor Wu and 15 silver medals from the Football Association. The runner-up team will receive 15 bronze medals. Tickets are available in two price ranges: 800 yuan and 1,200 yuan, and will be sold at the stadium starting at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>The postponement of the final by one week provides China Aviation with the opportunity to train and recruit players from Hong Kong, which is called "gathering strength while waiting for the opportune moment." If they are determined to win the championship, they only need to borrow three strong players from Hong Kong to secure the trophy. Even if they do not borrow players and only recall old players Tian Rongfa, Zhuang Wenquan, and Liang Mingxing, it will be enough to increase the team's overall strength. Moreover, with the momentum of revival, China Aviation should be able to dispel the panic of losing seven goals to Railway in the league. The young players need to be bold and meticulous, ensuring that both wings take flight, enough to contain Railway's defense. The midfielders should try to control the center field, contain the two inner forwards Lu and Xiao, and fight to the end. The outcome can only be determined after a fierce battle.</p>
<p>It should be known that in the elimination round, one must have the stamina and speed to play for the full 90 minutes in order to demonstrate skills and maintain a good state. However, luck is also an important factor.</p>
<p>Railway still has the same lineup, adopting the short-passing tactics of Jialiliwan, with tacit communication. Gao Baozheng's steady third inner defender, Lu Qingxiang's header, and Zhang Jie's sudden attacks are all advantageous. What they lack is speed and a striker who is good at shooting. The wings are not ideal. However, in terms of strength and experience, they are slightly better than China Aviation. If they have a mindset of fear of loss, they may be taken advantage of by China Aviation. If they enter the field in good condition, they may have a chance to defeat China Aviation, because Railway is a team that requires all eleven players to be in top form in order to perform at their peak. If they do not get off to a good start, they should be calm and respond patiently. Once they find their rhythm, they will naturally gradually improve. It should be known that calmness leads to victory, and impatience leads to defeat. Whether Railway can win today depends on its ability to use strategy to cope with China Aviation, which is coming with all its strength.</p>

<h3>Zhichao is in Poor Condition, Lost to Jingwu 1-3 Again - Yiyuan is Chilly in Spring, Fans' Enthusiasm is Low</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The second round of the Jia Group of the Football League restarted yesterday. Jingwu and Zhichao met at Yiyuan. The spring chill was bone-chilling, and with the threat of rain, fans' enthusiasm was low, with fewer than 500 spectators attending. The scene was bleak. Although Zhichao had Wu Qixiang sitting in the central defense, he could not turn the tide alone and lost to Jingwu 1-3. The first half ended with no score.</p>
<p>In the first half, both sides went all out and were evenly matched, achieving nothing. In the second half, Zhichao scored a penalty kick first, which made them overjoyed. Unexpectedly, the situation changed, and Jingwu sent a free kick straight into Zhichao's net, tying the score. Then, Zhichao's young players began to lose heart, while Jingwu became more energetic, scoring two goals in a row, ending the game at 3-1. Wu Qixiang personally took the field at the end, taking over as center forward and leading the entire army to counterattack, but it was ineffective. Zhichao's goalkeeper Zhang Delong played the pipa greatly, showing that experience is very important in the field.</p>
<p>Jingwu kicked off the attack, and the five forwards attacked fiercely, but were blocked back. Fang Renqiu raised the banner again, ran quickly along the side, and sent the ball in from a distance. Wu Jingren's shot went wide. Zhichao was unwilling to give in, and Zhu Jiazheng dribbled the ball deep, passing to Sheng Peter, who deceived Huang Lipu. Chen Huimin abandoned the goal to meet him. Sheng's shot hit Zheng Deyao's leg and bounced out. Guan Yongchang rushed over and touched it out of bounds. After that, the two sides were at a standstill, and the first half ended with no score. Both sides remained unchanged in the second half. Zhichao's Sheng Peter went on a solo raid, going straight into the penalty area. Yu Qi tripped him, committing a foul. Qian Yunqing took the penalty kick, and the shot went into the net. However, because Zhu Jiazheng broke in, the penalty was canceled and retaken. Sheng Peter took the kick and scored, giving Zhichao the lead. Jingwu was unwilling to give up and launched a large-scale attack. The five forwards infiltrated Zhichao's hinterland. Zhang Delong could not attend to everything, forming an empty goal. Zhuang Xinjia shot, but fortunately Qixiang blocked it. Jingwu replaced Li Rongbang with Wang Guoguang, and the attack was indeed greatly strengthened. Fifteen minutes later, Lu Yide committed a handball outside the penalty area. Wu Jingren took the free kick, and the ball flew like an arrow, straight into the net, tying the score for Jingwu. Not long after, Jingwu came again, riding the momentum. Zhuang Xinjia dribbled the ball straight in, passing Lu Yide and pulling it into the net, scoring another goal, making it 2-1, taking the lead. At this time, Lu Yide left the field due to cramps, and Gu Erlu replaced him. Jingwu's attack was still strong, like fire and tea. Wu Jingren, like Liu Lang, re-entered the paradise. Wu Qixiang went out to assist in the attack, but did not return to defend in time. Wu Jingren seized the opportunity to launch a cold arrow from 30 yards away, heading straight down. Zhang Delong's mind was distracted, and he made a big mistake. The ball slid into the goal through his legs. After this blow, Zhichao's anger rose high. Wu Qixiang and Sheng Peter exchanged positions and took over the command. However, the young players were already exhausted, and the end of the crossbow was no longer able to penetrate the silk. As time ran out, Jingwu defeated Zhichao 3-1.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Youth Cup football replay, Yingguang vs. Pan Team, is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM today at Yiyuan. The referee is Jiang Yin-seng, and the linesmen are Deng Xiaoliang and Yue Xiurong.</p>
<h3>Basketball Action Tonight: Hua Lian vs. Macleans Again, Donghua vs. Maoxun No Less Than a Championship Final, Li Team vs. Xinghua Evenly Matched</h3>
<p>The Basketball League continues with three women's group matches tonight. The games will begin at 5:30 PM at the City Gymnasium. Tickets are still priced at 500, 1,000, and 1,500 yuan for reserved seating. Sales will begin at 3:00 PM. The Four Dimensions Boy Scouts will maintain order at the stadium.</p>
<p>Xinghua vs. Li Team (Women's Group) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Donghua vs. Maoxun (Jia Group 2A) 6:15 PM</p>
<p>Hua Lian vs. Macleans (Jia Group 1) 7:15 PM</p>
<p>The women's team will open the show. Xinghua will meet the Li Team again. In the first round, Xinghua lost to the Li Team by a narrow margin of 37-40, a difference of one and a half points. This time, the two teams will not let go of each other. Both teams are equally strong in the women's group, second only to the Green Team, and are vying for the runner-up spot. Xinghua has a gathering of famous players and newcomers, but the fact that captain Wang Huiling has not been able to play has affected the team's morale. However, Wang Shan, Zhu Jiazhen, Wang Zhelun, Qian Mengyue, and others will definitely strive for victory in this crucial moment. The Qian sisters are the soul of the Li Team, and Yao Silian is also a good player. Tonight, in order to maintain their reputation and win the runner-up spot, they will definitely fight hard against Xinghua.</p>
<p>Following is the match between Donghua and Maoxun of Jia Group 2A, which is the main match of the group. The former has won both matches, and the latter has won all three matches. This is no less than a championship final. Tension and excitement are naturally expected. In addition to Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun, who were originally basketball players, the rest of Donghua's team are all famous football players. The entire team has a bold style, charging and breaking through with extraordinary fierceness. Yanxiong, Xianglong, Youliang, Li Yao, and others also have close cooperation. However, Maoxun is also not a pushover. Liu Zhaoren, Zhuo Guanzheng, and others are very agile, and Sun Jiawen's shooting is the key to the team's scoring. It is difficult to predict who will win tonight.</p>
<p>The final match is Hua Lian vs. Macleans of Jia Group 1, which is also a major highlight. Hua Lian's players are known for their excellent skills and talent. The elder Li, Adi, Songyuan, and others need no introduction. The team's newcomers Le Jiazhou and Li Hanting are also outstanding players. Jiazhou's shooting is like divine assistance, and Hanting's charge and break are agile and sharp. In the first round, Macleans lost to Hua Lian by one point and is unwilling to accept it. Tonight, the foreign team is making a comeback with ill intentions. Moreover, the players of the Macleans team are tall and have long arms, and are good at defense. It is not easy for Hua Lian to attack. Furthermore, the foreign players Lees, Bramann, and Coffins are also very fierce. Recently, the team defeated the Shanghai Police 57-42, which also proves their potential. They should not be underestimated because of their past mediocrity. The fact that Pei Feier defeated Hua Lian should not be forgotten.</p>
<h3>Pei Feier Loses Form, Shanghai Police Wins Big</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the Basketball League, the Shanghai Police defeated Pei Feier again last night, 56-40. The American team was behind 28-21 in the first half, trailing by seven points. Pei Feier defeated the champion Hua Lian and Macleans the previous week, attracting much attention from fans. However, their performance last night was abnormal. Their shooting was lackluster, and they missed many shots. The Shanghai Police, on the other hand, played well and had good luck. In the first half, the Shanghai Police led by as many as eleven points, 20-9. Pei Feier tried to catch up, and the black player Brown ran all over the court. The score difference in the first half was reduced to 28-21. In the second half, the Shanghai Police maintained a six- or seven-point lead for a long time. When the black player Brown was penalized, he angrily left the court, and Pei Feier's formation was completely shaken. The Shanghai Police's shots went in like a string of pearls, and the American team could not save the situation. The biggest score difference was 55-35, a difference of twenty points. The final result was 56-40. In the women's group, John defeated the Li Team 30-18. John led 14-11 in the first half. In Jia Group 2, the Shan Team defeated Chongde 50-25. The score in the first half was 25-12, with a ratio of 2:1.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Police sent Wang Bowen, He Zeng, Shi Jiuquan, Fu Qixia, and Wang Rongsheng to play.</p>
<p>Wang Bowen scored first, and Brown responded. He Zeng infiltrated, and the American team called a timeout. Rong Sheng committed a foul, and He Zeng displayed his power, scoring twice. Parks committed a foul on Little He, and he made both free throws. The Shanghai Police led 10-3. Bowen scored again. Pei Feier's ball often revolved on the rim, and they only scored points through free throws, which was not worth the loss. The score became 20-9. Only then did Brown score five consecutive points with two throws and one free throw, retreating to 21-26. Wang Bowen was injured and left the court, and Liang Yongbiao replaced him. Yongbiao made contributions after entering the court, 28-21. The first half ended with the Shanghai Police leading by seven points.</p>
<p>After changing sides, Qi Xia scored first, and Eckert immediately leveled the score. The two armies tugged at each other. At 32-25, He Zeng committed his final foul and left the court. Wang Rongsheng replaced him. The Shanghai Police's momentum rose again, and Liang Yongbiao scored three consecutive three-pointers. Jiuquan scored four points. The American team only managed to score one long shot, and the score was 29-40. Pei Feier still tried to fight for victory, but the Shanghai Police had strong defenses. 45-33, 51-35. The American team called timeouts many times, but they were exhausted. Qi Xia and Jin Dian scored two points each, 55-35, a difference of twenty points. At the end of the game, Pei Feier lost to the Shanghai Police again with a score of 40-56.</p>

<h3>John Defeats Li Team</h3>
<p>In the women's group match between John and the Li Team, John was one step higher. In the first quarter, they were both powerful and prestigious, making the Li Team's younger sisters at a loss. It was a one-sided situation of 6-0. However, in the second quarter, Liang Miaoling and Fan Yu of the Li Team cut through and seized the base, making it a tense situation of 12-10. John's Li Miao committed four fouls and left the court, replaced by Zheng Jingyuan. In the first half, John had 14 points and the Li Team had 11 points. In the third quarter, John's Wu Hanlian and Lin Jingyi attacked separately. The Li Team's defenders were short, which was very disadvantageous. The score in this quarter was 22-15. In the last quarter, Yao Wenda of the Li Team also committed four fouls at 24-15, and Wang Jiahui replaced him. After that, both sides committed many fouls, and free throws were frequent, making the audience feel bored. John's Zheng Jingyuan also left the court with five fouls. Five people finished the game, but John still won 30-18.</p>

<h3>Shantou Team Defeats Chongde</h3>
<p>In the Group Two D match between Shantou Team and Chongde, Shantou scored five points immediately upon entering the court, an extraordinary start that intimidated Chongde into calling a timeout. Within ten minutes, the score became 15-5. In the next five minutes, neither team made significant progress. The first half ended with Shantou at 25 and Chongde at 12. In the second half, Chongde showed signs of a resurgence, but Shantou's offense only intensified. Ultimately, Shantou won with a score of 50-28.</p>

<h3>New Venture in Sports World: Radio Facsimile Captures Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th]  The upcoming boat race between Oxford and Cambridge Universities in Britain may be broadcast using radio facsimile. The initial organizers believed that using radio facsimile on a fast-moving launch would be difficult, but after testing, they have achieved considerable success. It has now been decided that during the race, rotating cameras on the launch will capture both close-up and distant shots, transmitting them to eight relay cameras positioned along the banks of the Thames, which will then forward the images to a radio facsimile broadcasting station located at Alexandra Palace for broadcast. Using multiple broadcasting cameras to capture a single sporting event is a groundbreaking endeavor.</p>
<h3>Breaststroke and Butterfly Stroke to Be Separated as Swimming Events</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] The question of whether the butterfly stroke should be considered a variation of the breaststroke has been a topic of debate for a long time. While most believe that the butterfly and breaststroke are completely different swimming styles, some argue that they should be considered the same. After the most recent Olympic Games, the International Sports Conference considered a proposal from Australia to separate the two swimming styles into two different events. The proposal passed with a vote of 42 to 31. However, the International Swimming Federation also appointed a research committee to study the matter, which ultimately overturned the previous decision. Therefore, the current status remains uncertain. The United States favors treating the butterfly and breaststroke as the same style. The former president of the International Swimming Federation, Mr. Huan En, has expressed his opposition to overturning the previous decision in his capacity as a managing authority. As such, unless the conference to be held in Italy this year ultimately decides to make changes, it is highly likely that the butterfly stroke will continue to be treated as a form of breaststroke in the World Games.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Tennis Tournament Dominated by Chinese Players</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Air Mail] In the semi-finals of the Hong Kong grass court tennis doubles tournament on the 17th, the four teams advancing to the finals week, following the singles competition, are all Chinese players. Although three of the four matches were decided in just two sets, the victories were not as easy as the scores suggest. Each victory was hard-earned after considerable threat from the opponents. Ye Guanxiong and Li Huitang achieved a decisive victory with two sets of 6-2, but their overall victory was slower than the completion of the first match on court number one, which lasted three sets, indicating that each game was a hard-fought battle. Particularly commendable was the pair of Cai Bingfen and Lu Dingxiang, who, despite facing the best doubles team in Hong Kong, lost by only 4-6 and 5-7 after a valiant effort. Li Wencheng and Chen Decan, both returned overseas Chinese youths from Southeast Asia, have already shown considerable skill. However, the aging lawyer Luo Wenhui, approaching sixty, and the foreigner Hinnell, past their prime, posed a significant threat in the first set, ultimately losing after twelve games, which is also noteworthy. Based on the observations of the past two days, I believe that Ye Guanxiong not only has a high chance of winning the singles title this year, but also, if Li Huitang can perform to his potential, they have a chance of winning the doubles title as well.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Techniques</h3>
<p>— Translated and Described by Qi Gong</p>
<p>Illustration 6:  In the attacker's mindset, "advance where there is an opening, stop where there is resistance." The defender's response should be cautious, fearing that a single failure will lead to complete collapse. Therefore, carefully assess and adapt to the enemy's formation." This is the essence of the moving zone defense.</p>
<p>The diagram shows the right guard. The attacker being guarded no longer has possession of the ball. The guard should shift her position to guard another attacker with the ball. When the center guard sees the right guard moving to guard the ball carrier, she must immediately retreat to the second line of defense to restore the original defensive formation.</p>
<p>Illustration 7: The right guard continues to guard the attacker with the ball. The curved lines in the diagram indicate the player's planned running route. If the ball is passed further into the same zone, the center guard rushes forward to guard the ball carrier. If the ball is passed to the right corner, the left guard runs to the right side of the basket to guard the ball carrier, while the center guard quickly returns to the area between the basket and the free-throw line to guard that zone. In this fourth shifting formation, the left guard is the third line of defense. She must be aware of other attackers who may have a chance to receive the ball, as this area is close to the basket and is a dangerous scoring zone for the attackers. If the ball is passed by the attacker far to the left of the basket, the left guard rushes from her original position towards the ball carrier to guard her. The center guard remains in the central second line of defense. The right guard retreats to the third line of defense as shown in Figure 3. The key to effectively using these four shifting zone formations is to have tacit communication.</p>
<p>While basketball defensive tactics have improved, so have more sophisticated offensive tactics to break through advanced defenses. "Using wisdom against wisdom" and "using deception against deception" still require skill. If one does not carefully assess the enemy's situation and employ offensive tactics accordingly, it will be difficult to break through their defensive formation. Therefore, Tai Gong said, "The art of winning battles is to closely observe the enemy's opportunities and quickly seize the advantages, then strike swiftly and unexpectedly" to achieve success.</p>
<p>In actual games, the attacking team will naturally use various methods to attack the defending team's shifting zone defense. As mentioned above, attacking teams sometimes use three attackers concentrated in one zone to pressure one zone of the defense. However, attacking teams can also use a fast-paced offense to break through the shifting zone defense. This method involves making quick passes back and forth along the eastern sideline to force the defending team's guards to shift to the eastern sideline to defend. In this way, as long as the attackers can execute quick passes and long diagonal passes across the court, the attacker on the western side can easily get a chance to shoot. Because the defending team's guards may not have enough time to shift their zone to guard the attacker suddenly appearing on the western side, the guards are out of reach. However, using a three-line shifting zone defense can effectively counter this offensive tactic. One only needs to maintain the area within the zone during the shift, filling the gaps in the three lines of defense to intercept the opponent's passes. Then the attackers will inevitably encounter obstacles. The guards in the back two lines do not necessarily need to stand behind the backs of the guards in the front line. This point must be noted.

<h3>The "Need" Chapter</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>I remember it was a long time ago when there was a dispute between labor and management in the movie theater industry. The labor side told everyone how ruthless the management was, making so much money but still treating employees extremely harshly. It seemed that all the movie theaters were showing the most boring and low-brow films from Hollywood. I once innocently asked them: Do such bad movies still make money? Their answer was brilliant: What does it matter if the movie is bad? Shanghai people "need" it! The more boring, the bigger the box office!</p>
<p>"Need" is indeed the most realistic thing. People need rice and coal briquettes. People sometimes need to watch plays and smoke cigarettes, which is understandable. But Shanghai people need even more than these things. There are many examples right in front of us: Fan Xuejun was hailed as the queen of Suzhou storytelling, and several newspapers and magazines condemned this event. The reason was correct: in times of national crisis, indulging in entertainment is detrimental. But I heard that 5,000 tickets were printed for the coronation ceremony, and they were snatched up in an instant. Later, many people asked for favors to get a few tickets to attend the event. I believe that condemnation will not have much impact on the event itself, because people need it!</p>
<p>Then there is the case of Mr. Sun Ke and Ms. Lan Ni, which has been making headlines for the past two days. Supervisory committee members have filed impeachment charges, reportedly fearing that "national discipline will be unraveled and integrity in officialdom will be lost." In fact, Shanghai people are no less concerned about this matter than the supervisory committee members. In many situations, I often hear people asking each other: "Do you know about Lan Ni's past..." Because Lan Ni is a woman, especially a woman with a scandalous story, everyone "needs" to investigate and inquire. Clearly, Lan Ni's significance in the hearts of the general public outweighs "discipline and integrity."</p>
<p>As soon as you turn on the radio, you can hear a series of soft and saccharine so-called popular songs. Since the songs are called popular, it is of course because the public eagerly "needs" them. The Sui Book records that in the early years of the Kaihuang era, there was a musician named Wan Baochang who wept upon hearing the music played by the Tai Chang Temple. It is said that he claimed that those musical sounds were "licentious and mournful," the sounds of a dying country. History has proven that by the end of the Daye era, "the world was killing each other to the point of exhaustion." I have a rudimentary understanding of music. In my imagination, the "plaintive and licentious, not elegant and proper music" that Wan Baochang referred to at that time, and the popular songs that "use Xiaolü as Bianzhi, violating the principles of mutual generation," may not be the same as the set of songs that are sung with a crying sound through the nose today, such as "Your eyes are darting around, can't stop looking," etc. Otherwise, people have the wisdom to choose what they like and dislike. If those "song selections"—more abundant than Beethoven's complete works—truly foreshadow "the world killing each other to the point of exhaustion," why is everyone making "song request calls" like snowflakes every day, needing them so sincerely and earnestly?</p>
<p>One day, I happened to see an elderly foreigner in a lending library in the central district, diligently burying himself in reading. The man's clothes were not neat, and he seemed extremely devout as he pored over the thick, original book. The book cover seemed to have the words "Shakespeare" on it. I wondered to myself, how could this old man "need" Shakespeare? Before I could decide, I noticed two young men behind him fighting over a picture magazine. One of them said to the other: Don't fight, I'm treating tonight to see Tong Zhiling's "Splitting the Spinning Wheel"! As he spoke, he pulled out what looked like a theater program from his side, looking smug. I took a cold breath and retreated. To this day, I still believe that there must have been countless young men that night who were desperately trying to buy tickets because they "needed" to see the gyrating hips and listen to the high-pitched singing of "Beijing Opera"!</p>
<h3>The Story of a New Suit</h3>
<p>— Bifeng</p>
<p>In Belfort, Ireland, the acquisition of clothing is strictly limited. A local resident traveled to Dublin in southern Ireland, where nothing is restricted. So he bought an entire suit - including shirts, shoes, a hat, even underwear, and ties. He put all the new clothes in a trunk and asked a porter to send the trunk to the train to Belfort the next day. His plan was to change into the new clothes before the train arrived, throwing away the old clothes, so as to avoid trouble with the Belfort customs.</p>
<p>The next day, after the train started, he took the trunk, locked himself in the restroom - took off his old clothes, and immediately threw them out the window. But when he opened the trunk, he was shocked to find that it was completely empty except for an old telephone book and a bunch of newspapers.</p>
<h3>The Miracle of Artificial Jewelry</h3>
<p>— Cang Yu</p>
<p>If you saw an order form from a jewelry store that read, "Two hundred feet of ruby on a stick," would you think the jeweler was being absurd and ridiculous?</p>
<p>In fact, not at all. He can certainly place such an order and be sure to get such goods.</p>
<p>Farmers know that in the warm summer, asparagus can sometimes grow half an inch in an hour. Does that surprise you? But the growth rate of asparagus is not as fast as that of rubies, which is truly amazing. At the Linde Artificial Jewelry Factory in Indiana, USA, rubies grow hundreds of miles a year in its roaring furnaces.</p>
<p>The Linde Artificial Jewelry Factory is a leading manufacturer of artificial jewelry in the world. Its new inventions are endless, and its exquisite workmanship rivals that of natural jewelry. Unless you are an experienced jeweler or expert, you can't tell the difference between real and fake.</p>
<p>You can buy a two-foot long and two-foot thick piece of ruby at the Linde Artificial Jewelry Factory for only $1,500. Jewelers can cut it piece by piece and make various kinds of jewelry. The birth of such a large-scale artificial ruby is a major change in the world jewelry market.</p>
<p>The Linde Artificial Jewelry Factory has now invented a way to create a six-ray star on a ruby, which is much more beautiful than a simple natural ruby. A natural ruby worth one million dollars can be bought for only $750 if it is made artificially.</p>
<p>They have also invented a new gemstone called "Luminous Stone." Its brilliant light is dazzling. The most special thing about this new gemstone is that it shines even brighter under electric light, so it is very popular.  The factory's research department is now focusing its efforts on experimenting with the manufacture of artificial diamonds. They hope this is the next invention.</p>
<p>Today's artificial jewelry is not only the darling of decorative items; it also has its uses in industry, such as in the manufacture of electrical equipment and medical instruments.</p>
<p>The Linde Artificial Jewelry Factory's business is very developed. Their engineers believe that all naturally produced jewelry can be manufactured artificially, and the imitations are so lifelike that they are even more ingenious than nature.</p>
<h3>Suicides in America</h3>
<p>— Cao Guoping</p>
<p>Suicide is very common in the United States. The age of the suicides and the reasons for suicide are different. Professor Miheinovi, of Saint Louis University in the United States, recently conducted a survey, the results of which are as follows:</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, 42 percent of suicides were from people aged 45 to 64. Twenty years ago, only 30 percent of suicides were over the age of 45.</p>
<p>Another survey shows that the suicide rate for whites is much higher than for blacks. Although blacks account for 10 percent of the city's population in St. Louis, their suicide rate is less than 3 percent.</p>
<p>Analyzing by marital status, married people account for 55 percent; single people account for 23 percent; widows and divorcees commit suicide less often.</p>
<p>On average, the most suicides among men are workers. Among women, most suicides are housewives.</p>
<p>What is the reason for suicide? According to a report given to the New York Academy of Medicine by Dr. Kepakrik, suicide is due to "self-esteem" and "self-hate." According to Dr. Ke, a person's suicide is due to his inability to achieve a goal, which leads to disgust for himself and the world. Suicide is an expression of hating the world and oneself to the extreme, seeking to destroy oneself or implicate others.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid suicide is to understand oneself—to seek the stable development of the inner self. Second, religion also plays an important role in reducing suicide, because all churches strictly forbid suicide, and the most devout believers rarely take their own lives. Third, the power of education enables people to understand the value of life, so as to reduce the idea of suicide. Half Success</p>

<h3>Couplet</h3>
<p>— Liu Yun</p>
<p>Last night we discussed many anti-Qing stories, from all over the country, rambling without end. One of those present mentioned a character-splitting couplet, which showed great ingenuity, saying that a woman surnamed He married a man surnamed Pan, and someone wrote a couplet to congratulate them: "Marrying Pan, there is water, there are fields, and there is rice; Bringing He, adding people, adding mouths, and adding Ding." I laughed and said: This couplet is good, fortunately Pan has water, fields, and rice, and life can be guaranteed without worry; otherwise, adding people, mouths, and Ding, how can we afford it! The whole place roared with laughter.</p>
<h3>Railway Fare Issues</h3>
<p>— Qi Nian</p>
<p>Before the war, railway passenger fares were calculated based on the length of the mileage, so that between stations, even if there were slight differences in the distance, the price would necessarily be different, and although the difference was slight, there would be absolutely no additions or subtractions, which could be called fair.</p>
<p>In the early days of victory, commodity prices fluctuated frequently. As railway transportation was one of the public utilities, prices often remained unchanged, and were adjusted only every few months, so they seemed even lower. However, after the war, the railway adopted a segmented valuation system, and although the routes were long or short, the prices were rarely different. Passengers on short routes felt disadvantaged, but since the cost was so low that they could afford it, they had no complaints.</p>
<p>However, recently public utilities have followed the rise in commodity prices, with prices changing every ten days, making them unpredictable. Railway fares, in order to maintain their own profits, how could they be an exception? As a result of repeated adjustments, the numbers are no longer small, and there is still no difference between long and short routes. Although fares are said to be much lower than before the war, in reality, short distances feel much more disadvantaged. Consider the following example.</p>
<p>For example, from Shanghai to Kunshan, a distance of more than a hundred Chinese miles, the third-class fare is 1,200 yuan, which, calculated at the then rice price, is about four or five jiao before the war, which is still appropriate. But from Kunshan to Zhengyi, a distance of only a dozen Chinese miles, the price is 1,000 yuan, which is about three jiao; and from Zhengyi to Weiting, a short distance of only nine Chinese miles, the price is the same. Compared with the pre-war period, the fare from Kunshan to Zhengyi was two jiao, and the fare from Zhengyi to Weiting was one jiao. Then, compared with the past, is it not doubled? This is all due to the adoption of a segmented valuation system.</p>
<p>Looking at today's passengers, long-distance travelers are mostly freelance travelers and not formal passengers. They take advantage of the price differences between the two places, traveling back and forth with goods, to seek large profits, carrying boxes and cages, making it impossible to maintain order on the train. This was originally what the railway authorities had been painstakingly trying to crack down on, but now they are giving them low fares, which is really puzzling. Short-distance travelers are mostly ordinary people and regular businessmen in towns and cities, who are the real service objects of the railway authorities. They originally relied on the convenience of train transportation to negotiate official business, commercial contacts, and friendly connections with each other, but now they are selling high-priced tickets, which runs counter to the original intention?</p>
<p>The seat prices of ships that assist short-distance railway transportation originally rose and fell according to the level of train tickets, but now they are naturally rising. Thus, under the threat of double high prices, the little people can hardly travel and all complain. In order to reduce the burden on the common people and seek fairness and reasonableness, the railway authorities seem to have an urgent need to amend or abolish the segmented valuation system. If it is said that the income of the railway authorities will be reduced as a result, then the loss can still be made up by shortening the long, so there is no need to worry about gains and losses.</p>
<h3>Before and After the Issuance of Large Denomination Banknotes</h3>
<p>— Wang Qiuming</p>
<p>Three movements before the issuance of large denomination banknotes:</p>
<p>(1) The authorities deny it and solemnly refute the rumors;</p>
<p>(2) In response to the requirements of all sectors (it is unclear which sectors), the authorities have given it consideration;</p>
<p>(3) To alleviate the cash shortage, large denomination banknotes are issued.</p>
<p>Three movements after the issuance of large denomination banknotes:</p>
<p>(1) Money supply loosens and floods, and the prices of all goods soar;</p>
<p>(2) The authorities sell off materials or become greatly enraged, but to no avail;</p>
<p>(3) Promissory notes fly all over the place, and returned checks increase day by day. There are rumors in the market about the issuance of large denomination banknotes again.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Screening of "Sheng Si Hen"</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>China's first color film, "Sheng Si Hen" (Life and Death Regret), starring Dr. Mei Lanfang, was screened at the Queen's Theater at 10:30 am on March 18th. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to attend and meet Mr. Xu Jichuan (the film's dramatic arts consultant), which I deeply appreciated. I will briefly write a few words as an introduction to this film.</p>
<p>The director of this film is Fei Mu, and the color sound recording technical director is Yan Heming. In addition to Dr. Mei starring as Han Yu Niang, the important actors include Jiang Miaoxiang as Cheng Pengju, Wang Shaoting as the Flag Soldier Zhao Xun, and others. Those who have seen Dr. Mei's performance of this play on stage will know the story. However, there are differences between films and stage plays. After my visit, I learned that the plot has been slightly modified. First: this film still uses film set design, not stage as a background. Using a stage as a background during a screening would be inevitably stiff and monotonous. Second: the mill scene on stage has been removed from this film, making the whole play more compact. In the nun's scene, the old nun was depicted as a bad person on stage, but in this film, she is portrayed as a good person. This shows the director's foresight. The most exciting scene in the whole play is "Night Complaint," and the ending is particularly good.</p>
<p>The motivation for the release of this film is as Mr. Fei Mu and Dr. Mei have stated. Dr. Mei said: "I have two purposes for filming this movie: the first is that the film can go to many remote and secluded places that I cannot go to. Second, I have learned the art of Peking Opera for decades, and with the help of film, it can be spread among people and provide some reference material for our next generation of artists."</p>
<p>Mr. Fei said: "Dr. Mei and his partners of the era—such as Mr. Zhou Xinfang and Mr. Gai Jiaotian—almost unanimously realized this. They believe that the task of contemporary Peking Opera artists is not only to perform on stage and serve the audience; nor is it only to reform the content of old dramas and forcefully introduce Western-style reforms; the main and meaningful work is to record acting skills that meet the standards, and at the time of the setting sun, when it is fleeting, leave people with some 'rules' for people to criticize and observe."</p>
<p>Although this film is performed in a scenic pose, it still retains the abstract beauty of the old drama and has the unique advantages of oriental cultural art. The singing includes Erhuang Yuanban, Xipi Yuanban, Kuiban (fast tempo), Sanban (free tempo), Manban (slow tempo), Nanbangzi, and Erliu Yaoban. Dr. Mei's various good tunes are all in it. The color is gorgeous, comparable to Western films, and it is indeed a successful work. Those who have seen Dr. Mei perform this play on stage must see it; those who have not seen Dr. Mei perform this play should especially see this film.</p>
