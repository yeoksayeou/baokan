<h3 id="c1">新內閣可能一新耳目　何應欽奔走組閣中　司法章士釗正副秘長黃少谷倪烱聲　其餘部會首長正在邀約 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕何應欽之新閣，將以超然之姿態出現。何氏頃正本此原則，邀請超然之人士入閣；尤其注重於用新人，俾使其在此最艱危局面下產生之內閣，能一新國人耳目。何氏十六日竟日為組閣事向各方奔走，同時利用長途電話懇邀留穗·滬各地之人士入閣。何氏並於十六日晨十時在官邸邀約立委黃宇人·尹述賢·黃少谷·徐公遂·王啓江·湯如炎等交換組閣之意見。何氏曾將其組閣之籌備工作詳為說明，達兩小時後始散。下午五時陳誠·王陵基等分別往訪，略談後，何氏卽於五時半外出，訪立·監兩院院長童冠賢·于右任，下午六時許返官邸。茲悉：新閣邀約入閣之人士，範圍甚廣，如敎育部長一職，已分別徵詢梅賠琦·李書華·吳貽芳諸氏意見。外交部長亦先後邀請婦唱夫隨力子·胡適·傳秉常諸氏。至十六日晚均未獲得結論。大略言之，業經確定者，僅司法行政部長章士釗已首禾，秘書長黃少谷·副秘書長倪烱聲亦已决定。外交傅秉常，內政李漢魂，可能性較大。經濟部以新制職權甚大，不易覓得適當人選：雖曾邀請翁文灝，但已遭謝絕。財政·敎育·交通三部及蒙藏。僑務兩委會之人選，則均未作最後決定。至前水利部長薛馬弼氏，何曾堅請其入閣主持內政部，但薛已謝絕。何氏之組閣工作原則雖已確定，而事實上仍困難重重，且如各被邀之人士均藉詞推託，則革新作風之新閣，顯不易一蹴而成。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕台灣省主席陳誠及閩省主席朱紹良，乘天雄號專機，於十大日上午十一時五十分抵京。陳氏係於十五日離台飛閩，當日抵榕，旋於十六日晨偕同朱氏自榕飛京。李代總統特派李漢魂為代表，何應欽派龔愚為代表前往歡迎。白崇禧·顧祝同·徐永昌·周至柔等亦均往迎，陳氏精神尙佳，惟神情顯較過去為淸　。在機塲對往訪之記者，僅稱：「此行係奉李代總統之邀來京，所有各項問題，於請示後始能決定。」陳氏旋卽應白崇禧之邀，至白氏官邸午餐，於下午一時許晋謁李代總統，四時許再謁何院長，晚再訪顧祝同等多人。又陳氏已決定於十八日返台。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕川主席王陵基·渝市長楊森應李代總統電召，十六日上午十一時廿分自渝乘專機飛抵南京。兩氏下機略事休息並進午餐後，卽於下午二時半赴傅厚崗晋謁李代總統，報吿川渝政况。王楊均向李代總統表示：關於和戰大計，地方決完全聽命中央；惟地方政務上若干困難問題，則盼中央協助解決。下午二時兩氏晋謁何院長，晚訪財長徐堪，有所交談。據王主席十六日晚語記者，此來係應李代總統電召聆訓，並陳述地方政務上若干困難。現川中情况尙稱安定，惟邇來學潮迭起，以要求增加待遇為理由，省府正設法解決，迄未能使學潮平定。此來已向李代總統及何院長請示，希望中央對待遇問題能協助解決。此外並將向財部要求工貸及鹽貸以解决鹽業之困難。至胡宗南部入川事，乃係傳聞失實，並無其事。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕張君勱原定十八日晋京，訪當局洽商國是，現已接受醫生勸吿，展期成行。又民社黨定一兩日舉行中常會，在京常委均將返滬出席，屆時將決定該黨是否參加新閣，而張氏之赴京，將在常會舉行之後。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕首都政治空氣頗厚，因各地軍政人員之蒞上而呈活躍。率代總統晨夕主持會議，討論重要問題。上午九時在國防部召開之會議，卽由李代總統主持，何應欽·徐永昌·桂永淸·周至柔等均出席，會議性質係軍事會報。一般相信目前共軍陣兵江岸，準備渡江，同時新閣組成後和談卽須進行，故對大局不得不作縝密檢討。午後李代總統在官邸召見陳誠·王陵基等，晚九時再邀部份立委舉行談話會。聞李代總統對政院簡化機構事，甚表關切，尤其經濟部之組織龐大，覓請適當之主管，甚為不易，在事務上言亦極困難，另一方面政院部會减少後，將减少網羅各黨派及社會賢達政治人物入閣之可能，而使政府代表性受其影響。故李代總統在十六日晚召見立委時，卽就此主顆有所討論，欲求一合法之手續，以解決其困難。原擬採取由立院會議提出複議之辦法，使有變更，惟經研究結果，認為該案旣已決定，亦可不必變更，提出複議之議，予以打銷。應邀前往者有陳光文·袁其炯·尹述賢·涂公遂等二十餘人，至十時許始散。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十六日電）此間有資望的政治觀察家，預料政府之和談代表若不速赴北平，則中共方面卽將向南京政府提出最後通牒。此間人士指出下列種種跡象，以示中國的新危機已在積極醞釀之中：（一）陳毅部十九縱隊卅餘萬大軍已陣兵長江下游北岸，準備開始渡江；（二）中共領袖相信長江方面國軍不致有堅決之抵抗；（三）中共在政治上不能畏期等待遙遙無期的和談。共產黨如欲以軍力打垮南京，必欲在和談席上遂其目的，目前已達適當時期。中共若再事等待，則何應欽內閣及南京之立法院及監察院將使國家重新步上復興的正軌，並奪回一部份人民的又持。據若干方面告本社稱：政府至遲必須在本月廿日以前向中共正式表示，開始和談的志願，而中於孫內閣的辭職，使準備和談的工作，為之延擱了一個相當時期。就中共方面言：重新發動攻勢的唯一顧忌，乃為可能引起厭戰人民的反感，不過在和談席上，此一反感亦可被中共作為與其有利的因素，迫使國民政府方面為顧全民意，而不得不接受中共所提的條件。何應欽的戰略，想必為在和談席上同意由中共控制未來的聯合政府，但在地方行政中，設法保留國民黨的勢力。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十六日電〕新任行政院長何應欽，今日方忙於組織「和平內閣」，以期早日與中共開始和談。何氏抵京後已與李代總統數次會談，協商組閣份子，使政府內部團結，一致對外。陳誠，朱紹良今晨飛京，或為東南集團與政府有更密切合作之先聲，使何氏之未來內閣地位大為增强，聞吳鐵城在穗正勸令粵主席薛岳及綏靖主任余漢謀加入合作。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕監委孫玉琳張定華等，以挂永淸總司令對重慶艦之出走，事前疏於防範，且對於該艦官兵未能予以合理待遇，致釀成此次事件，桂實應負責任，已決定對桂提出糾舉，現正廣徵各委員簽署中。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十六日電〕海軍總司令桂永淸十六日告報界稱：「重慶號」軍艦之謎似卽將可以揭曉。渠稱：上月出走之「重慶號」，現仍停泊於渤海灣。由於國際公法之之限制，該艦幷未駛往大連。桂氏幷否認該艦業已被國軍飛機炸沉之說。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕重慶號巡洋艦自二月廿六日從上海出走後，其行蹤雖經空軍一度在烟台港發現，迄後卽又宣吿「失蹤」，目下自第三方面證實此艦不在大連，而空軍奉守國家條約，未能前往旅順港上空作一鳥瞰。據海總判斷：該艦恐仍棲息渤海灣範圍內，待機再行遠逸。海總目下雖仍以無綫電圖召回此艦，並不究其出走之責任，但據有資格人士認定此艦目前無非純由艦上原班海軍官兵控制，而雜有由烟台登艦為數約三百名之共軍「協助」，該艦駛出上海，係奉命赴台灣，携有海軍應變費卅萬銀元，攤至台轉發海軍在台各單位者，艦長新派原任海總第三署作戰處長盧東閣充任，原任艦長鄧兆祥則調海總一署副署長，在轉職前奉命在艦協助慮新艦長三個月，俾盧熟悉此艦之特性。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十六日電〕非正式可靠方面消息：國軍飛機確曾三次企圖炸沉投共之重慶號巡洋艦，該艦現匿於渤海內大連附近，受大連蘇高射砲之保護。</p>

<h3 id="c20">社論　遏阻交通事業自由加價 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>國營鐵路郵電於本月十一日起再度加價後，對於人心和市場的刺激，是相當沉重的。正在南京集會的立法委員，認為鐵路郵電自由加價的措施不合理，當即開會決議不予承認，并請行政院加以制止。十四日立院開會時，立委牛踐初等百餘人提出緊急動議，「制止交通事業漲價，行政院迄未執行，擬請採取有效措施案」一件，於十五日提出討論。據牛委員說：交通事業漲價，過去很少經本院討論，都是造成既成事實。上次本院通過制止交通事業漲價案，交通部方面是制止由你制止，加即電話通知交通部長，來院報告，何以尚未招待本院制止漲價決議原因；（二）再咨行政院，即日撤銷交通方面新近公佈火車郵電價格。各委員對本案無異議的贊同，決定改為質詢案，即是說，要從法律和行政觀點，追究交通事業加價的責任；但憶構成的事實，祇好讓它自由加價了。果爾，則此例一開，以後大可質詢由你質詢，加價我自加價，立法院又奈之何？</p>
<p>鐵路郵電屬於國營的交通事業，從它與人民生活和社會功用和關係說，它與都市的水電煤氣等事業，又同為一種公用事業。此種公用事業，必須由國家獨佔，并非國家專利，凡有關它的活動及其價格加減，都要受國家和地方的節制，以免公用性的獨佔，變為私有性的獨佔；更要避免公有的專利，流為私有的專利，那就完全失去公用事業的效用了。戰後數年以來，各項公用事業受物價波動和原料奇昂的影響，每有自由加價的措施發生，而每一次加價的結果，必影響一般物價的上漲。儘管公用事業者和公用行政機關，解釋公用事業的加價，為迫不獲已，但社會輿論是不原諒此一解釋的。從事實上學理上來說，也本是無可原諒的。</p>
<p>但像這次國營交通加價，社會輿論表示憤慨，立法委員提出質詢，監察委員準備糾舉，就因為它的自由加漲，基於不合理，當然要承受社會的反對，立法院的糾舉。為什麼說它不合理？其理由不外三點：（一）交通事業乃有關社會福利的獨佔事業，這個獨佔事業是以便利人群，活潑運輸，溝通文化為宗旨，乃公共所用公共所有及公共所需的獨佔性事業，共價格當不能以壟斷為手段，以牟利為目的，從有相當虧損，亦應由國家予以正當的補貼，不宜將此種虧損轉嫁人民。（二）如不得已而必需加價，在法律手續上，按照「國營事業管理法」第廿條規定，應將加價案提交立法程序，藉以獲得合法的支持。立法院也并非完全反對加價，祇要顧到社會公眾的負擔能力，而以公平推進的方式，酌量增加，同樣的可能達到加價的目的。（三）現在一般公用事業，本身的效能太低，用人太多，開支太大，會計從未受監察，管理技能也有差池，應該澈底改善，裁減冗員，撙節費用，使收支平衡。這三項理由，不僅就公用事業的管理政策說，并且就一般社會經濟政策說。</p>
<p>這次國營交通事業的加價，似乎又已構成一椿即成事實，雖然經過立法委員熱烈的反對，事實上恐已不能撤銷最近公佈的新價格。今後的問題，是如何求管理的合理化，從積極的設施上揭阻交通事業的加價，比較合乎現實的要求。英美蘇聯的交通事業，同為一種獨佔事業，而它們國家交通事業的道德律，係以社會服務為宗旨，它們管理科學化合理，人民即無怨聲，政府垂拱而治，彼此不傷腦筋。它們的人民為什麼這樣幸福？這是它們有一個民主進步的政府，而這個政府執行的社會經濟政策，是重管理講效用的，所以交通事業以及一切的公用事業，能够合乎科學化合理華的標準。</p>
<p>現在，何院長組織新閣即將完成。何氏對於交通管理向極注意，核戰時期兼管軍事運輸，曾有輝煌的成就，因此我們希望今後的何內閣，在政治革新經濟革新的目標下，注重調整交通，管理交通，務使國營交通事業管理的合理化，并從積極的設施上，遏阻交通事業的自由加價！</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕葡萄牙駐美大使館頃證實，葡政府與美國討論葡國參加大西洋公約之時，業已表示在承平時期不向葡國借用軍事基地的唯一條件下，葡國可以應邀參加大西洋公約。接近葡使館之人士并謂，國務院方面承認葡方此項保留可以接受。據云，葡國最關切者為對大西洋防務具有重要地位的亞索爾群島，該處為大西洋兩岸間空運的重要歇足點，葡國極盼在除非絕對必要的情形以外，經過該地的商業航空不致受有干擾。國務院人士并透露，葡國參加大西洋公約之初步談判，經過極為順利，故葡外長可望於四月初來華盛頓，會同大西洋公約七國之外長於四月四日舉行該約之簽字，使葡國同為該紅發起國之一。美方人士復謂由於葡人民對共產主義均具反感，故若葡政府批準該約，民意機構必不致反對。</p>

<p>〔路透社羅馬十五日電〕義外長史福蕯今日在眾院辯論大西洋公約之際，答覆共黨議員之質問。鄭重聲明大西洋公約決不附帶秘密條款。渠謂大西洋公約產生的原因，在於聯合國因蘇聯一再使用否決權，業已陷於麻痺狀態之故，故大西洋公約并非美國所創立，實為分裂歐洲的蘇聯所創立。蘇聯與巴爾幹國家之間已有類似蛛綱的協定存在，其中心即為莫斯科。共黨猶如法西斯份子，再三申述其謊言，以博得他人的信任。反對大西洋公約者即為反對馬歇爾方案及歐洲聯邦系統的同一份子，彼等之目的在逐步在西歐建立共黨獨裁制。吾人若不保持門戶的開放，以便利義國之加入大西洋公約，則吾人將為對於義國及和平犯有一大罪行。至於說到誰願戰爭的話，則決不是耗去半世紀時間以建立社會主義的英國，決不是對戰爭極感驚怖的法國，決不是兩次被敵騎侵入的比利時，決不是餘悸未秘的荷蘭，決不是全國僅有憲兵六百名的盧森堡，更不是全國一致反戰的義大利。如果共產情報局內之人，未嘗威脅自由和平的民族，則大西洋公約根本不致產生。但本人仍相信蘇聯雖願意憑藉第五縱隊征服他國，但尚不願選擇戰爭。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市府當局近因經合分署之建議，已在中西文報紙刊登廣告，發起一「多食麺粉運動」。此事之背景據悉如下：過去美援麺粉，大部用以供應華北，自共軍席捲平津之後，上海堆存之美援麺粉，已多至一萬五千噸，足供本市五百萬市民，以十日為期，每人配給五斤之用。因面粉久存易於虧損，經合分署亟願將其早日配售，故自本年二月份起，自配米之外，加配麺粉。但是南人習性食米，購買麺粉者，為數僅佔百分之五。按居住本市之華北籍居民，為數約佔百分之十五，以常理而言，渠等應喜食麺粉，但結果適得其反，渠等認為米較面粉易於保藏，售價便宜，且認為營養豐富故大部亦捨面粉而取米。經合分署無法可給，遂就商於市府，以廣告之方式，勸請市民自動多吃配給面粉。惟據關係方面透露：如此項運動不發生實效，可施有一日配糧時僅配麺粉而不配食米，每月分三期配出，每人每期本粉五斤。此事已有例可援，卽在去年十月限價方取消時，本市米荒嚴重，當時配糧全用面粉，且配售價格尚在市價之上云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕當無窮盡的罪行點綴着這繁華的國際都市之際，上海最近又有一種新騙局出現，別出心裁，而且專以汽車階級為行騙對象。一星期前，有一個美國籍仕女呌卡爾太太的，她同着二個朋友從同貝當公寓出來，還駕着一輛汽車，車行不久，突然發現有一身着空車制服的人故意在她車子後面碰了一下，并且立卽喝令停車，那個人接着跑了上來，和他在一起的還有另外二個同樣制服的人，其中一個會說英文，他警告卡爾太太說：「你把我朋友的衣服碰破了，必須馬上賠償損失七萬元。」卡爾太太當時大吃一驚，回頭一着，那人右臂衣袖上的確破了一個大洞，這是不是因讓卡爾太太的車給碰壞了呢？——那時天正下着雨，當然那人的週身是被淋濕的，但是仔細一看那人手裏拿着被斯下來的布呢，却是完全乾燥的，那麼無疑的這是一個預先佈置好了的騙局。所以卡爾太太當時便回答他：「我可以賠你錢，但這錢必須直接交到警備司令部，請你出示姓名及隸屬機關。」卡爾太太說完話，并立即去打電話通報警備部，正當這時候，這三個人同時不見了。</p>
<p>上述事情發生在本月十日下午三時一刻，事後卡爾太太便把經過情形，寫了一封信給英文大美晚報，在信裏她把那個不法軍人形容得很詳細——身長五呎四吋模樣，闊肩，戴棕色太陽眼鏡，戴空軍帽子，穿綠色卡其布軍服，以羊毛作裏子，外衣裏并藏有手槍，那個用作敲詐的破洞，是在左手上臂距手肘約四吋模樣的地方。</p>
<p>卡爾太太的信經大美晚報刊載了才四天，誰知同樣的事件又有出現。——昨天夜晚九時三刻，本報某讀者車經三馬路畫錦里一帶，發現迎面來了三個軍人，大模大樣的不肯避讓，這樣，車行速度便不得不放慢，車子駛近時，這三個人向馬路兩面略避，留出的空間，僅夠一輛汽車的闊度，當司機小心翼翼，正像考駕駛執照一樣的穿過之際，其中一個便以右臂碰車門，一面勒令停車，這時候他們三個便蜂擁而上，說是你的車把我的衣服碰破了，并出示手錶，說是錶也壞了，強令賠償。但是一看，手錶正繼續的走着，并無損傷，倒是右臂衣服上的確破了一塊，但是這破處高於車門，決非汽車任何部份所能碰得到的，那麼這又是個同樣的騙局，原是不難確定的。當這位讀者把經過情形告知本報後，記者認為有加以記載的必要。一方面報導記者，本市新騙局之層出不窮，希市民各自警惕。一方面也是希望治安當局加以注意，如不設法取締，則小市民連行路的自由亦將被剝奪了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市各國立大專學校校長，昨日中午曾集會討論向國行透支學校經費數額之計算辦法。決定透支數為生活補助費與學生膳費之總數。但因中央對生活補助費等之倍數標準尚未確定，故暫依目前二二五倍計算向國行透支。此外并決定致電廣州敎育部，請將本月份應補發之經費，及下月份預發之數，早日通知國庫署預作準備。</p>

<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>關於「局部和平」前後的一個城市的報道</p>
<p>（五）和平後的社會現象</p>
<p>「沒收官僚資本」，「保護民族工商業」，「發展生產，繁榮經濟，公私兼顧，勞資兩利」的標語，出現在解放後的北平市面，這對於一般小市民和工商業者，當然是一顆定心丸，消減了他們許多惴惴不安的情緒。其實中共進城以後，公營的企業和物資太多了，集中全力忙着接收，都還不易接收清楚，對於私人企業和一般工商業自無暇過問。究竟將來公營企業和官僚資本接收後，對於民營企業和工商業，中共將採取什麼樣的政策？官僚資本和民營企業的劃分，有許多地方會發生含混的現象，伸縮性很大！如何準確的劃分？這些都是問題。</p>
<p>可是就目前的現象而論，一般市民自共軍進城後，風氣漸漸有些轉變，大家的衣服裝束，都要穿得破舊一些，裝出一副窮酸相來。過去穿皮大衣和長毛絨大衣的摩登女郎，為避免無謂的意外糾紛，也都改穿普通呢大衣了。在一般工商業的發展上，除了日用生活必需品油，鹽，麺粉，雜糧……等等，因為不可缺少，尚有生意可做。其他如綢緞店，呢絨店，西服店，百貨店，……等的生意，便清淡得幾乎沒有生意了！王府井大街一帶的店家，門可羅雀，蕭條異常，很少有人去惠顧。其他一些實業公司，因交通斷絕，許多原料無法輸入，也便陷入停頓狀態。所以，儘管中共高唱「保護民族工商業」，而目前工商業的衰落景象，在一般工商業者的腦中，是投下一個可怕的陰影。同時，因為社會生活方式的改變，中共將來的工商業政策，必將重新研究而訂。</p>
<p>關於北平的物價，在剛剛宣佈局部和平的時候，曾經一度猛落，但是沒有一天的工夫，馬上繼續回昇，恢復原狀。當着舊的不管，新的未進城的眞空時期，物價更表現激劇的上漲，銀元的漲率較之低落時是十倍以上。共軍進城的時候，雖然正值舊歷新年初，還未開市。然而到了正月初七日，本來是開市的時候，因為人民票與金圓券的兌換比率尚未公佈，一般商店都藉故休息，仍未營業。黃金美鈔市場，亦未開盤。後來金圓券與人民票的兌換率確定為十比一，物價又受衝動，來了一次大漲，筆者離開北平的時候，（約在二月二十日左右）銀元的價格又由每元二百四十元人民票，漲到每元三百元人民票（卽金圓券三千元）了。除了雜糧，煤炭等土產品，漲幅較少，其他如汽油，報紙，香烟，五金，西藥，金鈔，銀元等，都是漲得非常厲害！和平後的北平物價，也是一樣的沒有安定。</p>
<p>金圓券的使用時間，經公佈為兩個月，以十比一兌換人民票。工人，學生，城市貧民則另訂優待辦法，憑居住證或公函證明以三比一兌換人民票，限十五日內兌完。人民票紙張印刷的惡劣，很有些像我們燒給死人的冥鈔，在口袋裹藏上一兩天，便會糢糊不清或扯斷了。冀南銀行和北海銀行的鈔票，更等而下之。現在接收了中央印製廠北平分廠，或者可以印出一批較好的鈔票來。在這次兌換金圓券的行動中，固然中共因此可早日吸收金圓券，向國民當區域套購物資，保持金圓幣值。但也是充分表現出中共幹部辦事效率和服務精神來！自二月六日起開始兌換，全城東西南北各大街，分設了五六百處代兌處，雖然兌換的人民是那樣擁擠，但是竟提前於二月十五日便兌換完了。這與過去發行金圓券，由各銀行收兌法幣的辦事效率及服務精神，便大不相同了！官僚作風的誤國，這兒又得了一個證明。</p>
<p>北平是個文化城，大中小學不下數百餘所，學生人數當有數十萬人。和平後的北平教育界和學校情況，當然是大家關心的問題。據筆者所知，首先接管的大學是清華，由教授代表組織校務委員會負責維持，并未派任校長，至於各院系課程如何改革，則尚在研究討論中，開課無期。其餘各國立大學的情形，也大致差不多，多已組織校務委員會，負責接收維持。私立大學亦有取消校長制，倣此辦理者。三民主義停止講授，國民黨及三青團學生停止活動，取消訓導長之設立，則是事同一律。各校學生有的參加了軍管會的接收工作，多數的則因郵電的隔絕，經濟來源斷絕，相率回籍了。過去的公費生，有政府的津貼和白麺，還天天在叫苦。現在中共則僅每人發了少數的棒子麺或小米，維持生活，他們便再也不敢叫了！</p>
<p>小學校的教職員曾經幾次開過會，集體學習討論，并由中共派員參加指導說明。主要的問題是教科書，學費，課程時間等。好在中共過去在解放區已經有了一套小學教材，只要加以翻印，便可應用了。其餘學費與課程時間等問題，都不難立卽決定，求到解放。中學校的問題是要比較繁雜些，教師人才的腦筋也須要變換變換，加以集體學習，開課尚遙遙無期，或者先行照舊開課，以後再慢慢加以改善。總之，在筆者離平的時候（二月二十日），無論大中小學校均未開課，則是事實。</p>
<p>正中書局和獨立出版社經中共接收後，改設為新華書店，其門市部在王府井大街南頭，旁邊還設了一個閱覽室，供人隨意入覽，開幕之日，購者甚多！新華書店是中共的精神糧庫北平局部和平後，大家需要學習毛澤東主義，於是不得不求之這個倉庫。新華書店裏便經常擠滿了讀者和購者，大家都希望能在這兒找到一些新的知識。一本精裝毛澤東論文集索價人民票七百餘元，合金圓券七千餘元，價錢未免太貴，使許多經濟不甚富裕的人，無法購買，只好望而却步。這一個投機賺錢，兼負了宣傳任務的買賣，到也是很可以一幹。</p>
<p>北平本來是一個消費的都市，因為生活程度不算太貴，失學失業的青年，留在北平者很不算少！尤其是東北，西北相繼撤守，地區漸漸縮小到北平一個市，由各地流亡來平的人也很多！此次局部和平實現，許多機關撤銷了，因此失業者也大有人在。中共訓練一般幹部的華北人民革命大學，訓練軍事幹部的軍政大學，恰在北平宣佈招攷，其須攷錄一萬多名，當然對於這般徬徨苦悶的失業失學青年，是一個重大的衝動，大家都湧向北大，師大的報名處去報名，好在只要有高小畢業以上的程度，便可以攷大學，誰不想去試一試呢？隨到隨攷，取錄的尺度想必不會太嚴，今日中共需要的是幹部，經此一番補充，當是一個重大的收獲！</p>
<h3 id="c109">藏糧於民　新疆擴大春耕運動 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 韋葦</p>
<p>〔迪化十一日航訊〕提到新疆的糧食問題，首先使人懷想着那號稱「塞外江南」的伊犁。伊犁向有北疆糧食倉庫和米麥之鄉之稱，這兒佔着天然優越條件，雨水充足，土地肥沃，氣候溫暖，故食糧產量冠於全省各區。每年產額，光是米麥兩項，卽達四五百萬市石，如果連包谷·高粱·青稞等雜糧算起，數在六七百萬市石以上。</p>
<p>喫不到伊犁米</p>
<p>過去北疆的軍糧·公糧·民糧，其糧源完全仰賴伊犁。連奔馳在西比利亞的火車裝載的大米白麺也有一部分是由伊犁輸出的。</p>
<p>然則這塊肥美的土地，在卅四年的秋天，不幸發生伊犁事變，從此，伊犁便脫離新疆政府的掌握和支配，從此，再也吃不到伊犁的大米和白麺了。</p>
<p>隨着伊犁的事變，阿山·塔城兩區亦特殊化了，使北疆糧源受到極大的影響。北疆共分五區，伊犁事變以後，祇剩迪化·哈密兩區。現在所有整個北疆的糧源，只仰賴這兩個區供給，然則，這兩個區的糧食產量，還不及三分之一。哈密區所轄的哈密·鎭西·伊吾·七角井四個縣局，都非常貧瘠，每年糧食產量最多不過一十五萬市石。迪化區所轄的迪化·阜康·半速·奇台·木壘河·昌吉·景化·綏來·吐魯番·鄯善·托克遜十一縣，卽使豐收，也不過一百五十萬市石，（其他雜糧在內。）這個數字，是不足供應全省人口集中的北疆的需要的。</p>
<p>每在糧食呈現恐慌的時候，人們總是不能忘懷這塊肥沃的土地——伊犁。</p>
<p>產量絕不平衡</p>
<p>除了伊犁·塔城·阿山三區以外，目前全省尚有七個區：南疆五個區，北疆兩個區，共有能耕地畝約為一千四百五十八萬餘畝，可產小麥七百萬市石，大米七十餘萬市石，青稞四十餘萬市石，包谷七十餘萬市石，扁豆四十餘萬市石，赤豆四十餘萬市石，綠豆四十餘萬市石，高粱七十餘萬市石，黃小米五十餘萬市石。但這個數字是豐收之年的估計，去年的收成僅及此數之一半。</p>
<p>全省食糧的產量，伊犁·塔城·阿山未特殊化之前，南北疆是平衡的。然則目前，南疆的產量要佔百分之七十以上，北疆僅佔百分之三十。</p>
<p>由於糧食產量供求的不平衡，使新疆當局頗傷腦筋。每年在支絀省庫內，拿出大批的款項來調運南疆的食糧，以調劑北疆的需要，并以補貼方式鼓勵糖商到南疆運糧來賣給北疆。然而這種辦法，實有遠水不救近火之勢。</p>
<p>運費高於糧價</p>
<p>新疆地區遼闊，南北疆的距離并不近，動輒在數百公里或千餘公里以上，而且交通不便利，交通工具也甚缺乏，汽車運輸只能通到焉耆，輪台·喀什·阿克蘇幾個交通點，其餘各縣交通完全靠獸力驛運。由於交通的不便，運費的高漲，不但運輸速率緩慢，而且也增加省府一批鉅大的開支。由南疆運一石糧到北疆，其運價高過糧價數十倍。但是是為補充北疆糧食的不足，省府也不得不咬着牙根這樣做。</p>
<p>農業難以發展</p>
<p>談到新疆農耕的情形，新疆是一塊大陸性的土地氣候寒冷乾燥，雨量甚少，土質多帶堿性及沙積層，因此，其收獲成數還不如內地，卽使在豐收之年，平均也不過五成，（卽每播種一斗，收獲五斗）普通能兩三成已是不錯。至於耕種技術方面，也談不上。由於這種天然地理的限制及技術的不良，使新疆農業無法發展。</p>
<p>糧食夠喫嗎？</p>
<p>那麼，新疆的糧食夠吃嗎？這個問題，最好是用鄉村農民的生活水準來解決。在鄉村裏，中家庭能吃到麺包已是不錯，普通多以小米·包榖·高粱等來充饥，不說十室九空，糧食能吃到四五月的，恐怕寥寥無幾。以最近採購公糧來作例子，這種糧食枯竭的情形更為明顯，配採一石兩石的都已無糧可交。據各縣政府的報告：人民每年的收檴，除交田賦及採糧外，自己就沒有吃的了。</p>
<p>如果以迪化目前的狀況來看，表面上，是可以勉強維持的，政府拿着大量的鈔票，向農民購買食糧，農民為了服從政府，盡其所有賣給政府，事實上，有些農民連種籽都成問題了。現在春耕在卽，各縣正紛紛請求省府貸款貸種給農民，假若老天爺要和新疆人民作難，來個旱災，風災或蝗災，則四百多萬人民必難逃脫饑饉的厄運。</p>
<p>開發糧源辦法</p>
<p>新疆的糧食不夠吃，究竟應該怎麼辦呢？我們認為：（一）趕快使伊犁的糧食向流。（二）大量開墾塔里木河兩岸，有着無限肥沃的綠原沒有耕種，假若政府能拿出大批的款項開關移民耕種，我們敢相信其收檴必大（三）開發水利，新疆農作物，大多是因為缺乏水而失收。（四）發展交通，以期供應平衡。（五）擴大農貸，以增加生產。（六）改良耕種技術，并防治病蟲災害。</p>
<p>新疆省政府，現在也正向着這幾方面作最大的努力，據我們知道，伊犁的白麺粉，就有好多萬噸卽將運迪。本年的春耕貸款省銀行業已大量撥發。最近鮑爾漢主席曾手令建設廳等有關機關，作擴大春耕的宣傳，維文新疆日報應此需要，準備出幾期增刊，省府秘書長劉孟純有一次在財經小組會議席上，曾剴切指出「藏糧於民」的堅決主張及辦法。我們可以相信，新疆省政府在邁向自力更生的道路上，糧食是可以求得自給自足的。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行配售銀樓原金之辦法，是經金融平準委員會議決，改採報價核配制。規定自上午九時半起，至十一時止，由各銀樓將請配數量呈交國行。至十一時後，再由三人小組核定配價，通知各申請人，然後由申請人解款，領取配金。</p>
<p>上午十時國行通知銀樓業改為報價核配制後，申請至近午十一時截止。惟銀樓業以新辦法方付實施，多存觀望，故竟無人申請。下午二時各銀樓申請報價核配，迄三時半截止，各銀樓報價為卅七萬五千元，國行認為無配售之必要，結果并未配出。</p>
<p>黃金配售辦法改變後，據中央銀行業務局長林崇墉談稱，黃金配售辦法早經決定二種。以往實施者為第一種，昨日實施者為第二種。中央銀行方面為爭取主動計，決定將此二種辦法輪流實施，使銀樓業方面無法捉摸平準會之配價，并無其他用意云。</p>
<p>中央銀行總裁劉攻芸，於昨晨九時起，假中國银行召開二次會議。第一次為金銀平準會例會，出席者有席德懋李道南林崇墉邵會華陳長桐等，商討改善黃金配售之技術問題。第二次為檢討會，另有財政部特派代表畢德林及監察使行署代表參加。由劉氏報告過去配售情形，再加以檢討會議。至十一時一刻會後，各出席者均默不發表一言。聞其中頗多具體決定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華股市昨日高開低收，中間緩步穩升，近午又起回風，市上銀根承隔夜行局差出影響，頭寸鬆濫，日拆低于七十元有供。晨初在銀根鬆動下，人心頗佳。各帮納胃尚暢，市勢堅擋盤旋。嗣後圈內流言紛起，檯面人心頓現不安，多頭尤不勝情虛，市勢一度回軟。永紗晨初在各方買氣籠罩下，卽以六元六角高盤開出。隔夜浮空抵補，卽升至六元七角一，金融幫證券幫并納，又升至六元七角五。大戶逢高吐售，市勢略軟，卽挫至六元六角一，五角八，中間站定六角左右盤旋。嗣後塲外流言四起，黃金一度軟弱，人心惶恐，買氣慘淡，瀉至六元四角九分，最後流言平息，黃金市勢回挺，人心轉穩，又升至六元五八。臨收聞實物市塲一致報疲，　面了售紛　，市勢再告瀉落，終以六元四角一分收市。中小股晨開均上升成許，景福新光散戶吸納甚暢，中間一度漲限。美亞勤興開後去勢亦挺，午收回平。台糖先高後低，臨收轉穩。統益亦見漲停，其餘平庸，成交四十億九千六百九十萬股。</p>

<p>外股微升　金債挺秀</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕洋股昨日市況平庸，銀根雖鬆，買氣不旺。初開時人心尚穩，塲上納胃尚濃，嗣聞港匯長開再縮，市勢略俏，繼聞香港股價不振，瞬又萎靡，喊價頓軟，怡紗初喊一三〇〇〇元，午收一二六〇〇元，一二八〇〇元，亞洲一二五〇〇元，一二七〇〇元，英聯一五五〇〇元有求，會德豐喊四萬有進，四三〇〇〇元有出，結果均平。</p>
<p>黃金公債晨開十八萬有進，嗣聞金價盤升，交易趨旺，市勢跟堅，步升至廿一萬。後因黃金近午回跌，市勢卽軟，喊十九萬，十九萬七千，午收二十萬，後市收盤十九萬八千元。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕黃金昨日前後兩市均見軋升。最初因銀根趨鬆，暗息低落，浮散戶多不願放息，於是執貨心理又趨濃厚，塲上多頭活躍，市勢穩步晋升。晨開在買氣籠罩下，人心頗俏，初盤卽開三八二，三八七，開後新買濃起，浮空抵補，市勢先盤於三八五，三八七，繼盤於三九〇，三九三，後高至三九六。高後人心轉虛，多頭顧忌，　面紛了，一度回小至三八五，三八二。午刻開央行未有動靜，人心安穩。以三八五，三八八之價收市。</p>
<p>午後銀根鬆弛有加，塲上買氣仍旺，市勢直綫上升。初開四〇五，四一〇，開後卽在堅檔盤旋，逐盤逐升，三時後登四一五，四一八，而至四一九，最後以四一七，四二〇收盤。</p>
<p>美鈔晨初開為七六五〇元，七七五〇元，中盤升至七八五〇元，七九〇〇元，後回小至七六五〇元，七七〇〇元，午收七七〇〇元，七七五〇元，午後開八一〇〇元，八二〇〇元，晚收八三五〇元，八四〇〇元。</p>

<p>大漲不算漲　臉上有風光　即使無金可配　也可不露馬腳</p>
<p>昨天一般物價，又普漲二成左右。算算利息，也不好算漲，所以也不好說央行失去了控制市塲的力量。央行之所以主持高利政策，就算這高利去沖淡這狂漲的程度。面子就好看得多了，高利政策的妙處，就呆以氫狂漲的責任，往高利身上推。</p>
<p>推卸責任，是中國官場的傳統作風，過去只見於一般行政上，運用到經濟方面，尚係近幾年來的事。</p>
<p>近年來，通貨惡性膨脹，於是物價大漲，過去當局常說「是投機囤積的結果。」便責任輕輕推卸到商民身上。</p>
<p>過去這種卸責方法，并不高明，因為市面大漲時，束手無策，總有點丟臉。</p>
<p>現在，有了高利這個東西，狂漲責任可以往利息上推。而且，一天漲二成，過去已覺狂漲；現在則覺未漲。過去，三天五天漲一倍，尚是鳳毛麟角，無不認為嚴重萬分了。現在，因為五角以上的日拆做底盤，所以卽使日漲一倍，也只以為僅八成。高利的好處，就在乎把大漲可以當小漲看是也。</p>
<p>卸責方法，高利政策已可謂妙不可言了。然財金當局，傎會動腦筋，昨又花樣翻新，配金辦法，又改為報價核配了。</p>
<p>報價核配，又是一個卸責的好辦法，其妙處，讓我道來：</p>
<p>（一）過去央行提高配金價，就背着抬高金價的責任，現在由申請者自己提出願購之價，經央行核準後配售，於是申請者把願購價提高，央行可順水照高價配出來，便可把漲價責任，推在商人身上了。</p>
<p>（二）假使申請者抑低願購價，那末央行有權不配。所以，這種辦法，也不會吃虧。</p>
<p>（三）過去央行掛牌配售時，不無照牌充分配售的責任，這是多麼危險的責任啊！現在改用報價核配時，央行雖在無金可配時也可在不核準報價的烟幕下，不至於露出無金可配的馬腳來。</p>
<p>由此可知道這種「報價核配」的妙處是：（一）有高價配金這實，而無高價配售之責；（二）無金可配時。也可不露馬腳，</p>
<h3 id="c122">銀元存款　財部允予考慮 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>關於銀元存款問題，頃據財部負責人表示，財部正考慮中，原則上已無問題。惟財部方面，不擬有任何硬性規定。如各行荘有些計劃，自可核准，至利息之高低，存款之運用，當不能超過法令范圍，卽與銀行法有抵觸者，則在取締之列。</p>
<p>昨日銀根稍鬆，各物俱見上揚。且指數發表後。一般薪水階級為避免現鈔貶值計，均爭兌銀元，一時大小頭身份百倍。上午大頭喊價僅五三（進）五五（出），迄晚大頭六千二尚有人換進。據云此次上漲之速，已開銀元上漲之紀錄云。</p>
<h3 id="c123">金銀市塲　下週能否成立　目前尚無把握 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據國行業務局某負責人昨語記者，本市金銀市塲，主管當局希望能於下週一正式成立，開始交易。該市買賣包括黃金，白銀，及銀元等。現在俟財政當局核定金業公會所擬之黃金現貨買賣辦法，俾交易有所遵循。</p>
<p>又本市金業公會，昨已開始清理公會塲地各項積物，裝接電話機之事，仍在接洽中，登記復業之會員已達廿家，索申請書者則已達一百家之　。照公會準備之情形而言，下週一復業之說，尚無端倪。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根，已自鬆趨濫。初開日拆仍有八九十元之譜。其後金鈔價穩，脫貨拆放者又多，外埠匯款及國庫支撥頻仍，大額款項紛紛流出，下午頭寸已見汛濫，日拆節節下跌，自七十五元瀉至六十五元，最後在六十元光景。</p>
<p>昨日國家行局庫有鉅額差出，共達卅六億六千餘萬元，洋商各行差八三億餘元，大交換各行差入六億一千餘萬元，小交換各行差廿七億三千集群萬元。</p>

<p>白粳收市高至四萬二千元　油市初堅終回麺粉買氣濃</p>
<p>食米饜續挺升，早開銀根尚未緊，南市場各米均提升三四千元，中市一度稍形回低，旋以門銷暢旺，銀根見鬆，收市又昂，白粳收市四萬二千，漲四千五，薄稻早稻均漲三千五。北市場粳薄稻普升三千，特粳四萬三千五，二市到貨共計六·一一一石。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>價格，開市勁漲，收市回跌，均受銀根鬆緊之影響，生菜油上漲甚大，早開十六萬五千，收市十五萬四千，軋升八千元。豆油收市十六萬，漲九千元。吉桶生油二十萬，開十九萬八千元，漲一萬四千，豆餅漲一千元，收市甚疲。</p>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>普挺一成，初市以銀根鬆動，進戶買氣濃厚，加以金價激升，人心極堅，老車一度高做一萬七千六百五，兵船曾破一萬七千關，後市傳聞央行有拋，銀根卽見轉緊，貨主深具戒心，且聞圈外轉疲，執戶居高思危，紛紛吐售，市勢終告回跌，兵船做一萬六千八百卅元，老車喊做一萬七千六百元，尚乏人問津</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>市勢，初開以米價激升，人心一致看好，黃豆挺秀一成，車豆高做三萬三千元，冬豆客帮有吸，普升一成半，後市以油餅轉疲，暗息步高，貨主吐售者頗不乏人，回降五百元，生仁再挺，芝麻疾升成餘。苞米以青帮沉寂，價乃下挫。</p>
<p>桐油上漲</p>
<p>桐油昨市開後卽以公用事業與輪船運費，一致上砌，頻將市面激挺，俄頃更因業中銀根鬆動，業外物品突飛猛晋，人心益形亢奮，買氣四溢，賣戶趁機哄抬，漲風頓盛</p>
<p>，愈演愈烈，臨收結果，各檔軋升一萬五千元之鉅，腳地亦頗強固。</p>
<p>茶市又升</p>
<p>自茶存步趨枯涸後，賣戶對於握在手中之少量陳貨，莫不認為奇貨可居，一味不允輕易割愛，而外銷箱茶，終因高於國外茶價，一時不易推銷，致過程久居岑靜，行市則告迭漲。</p>
<p>內銷茶本街等地進意雖可，惟交易狹隘，潛勢不甘　優，直上雲霄。</p>
<p>又悉：專供內銷之龍井綠茶，本年度「明前新貨」，際此風和日暖中發育頗為良好，聞溫州產區，約於二週後，卽可到滬。然據為中人云，茶價大都依據米價計算，照目前情形，預料今年新茶開秤時，勢必一鳴驚人。</p>
<p>杭木激漲</p>
<p>木材以銀根轉鬆，又值生活指數發表之後，人心復先堅挺，市復重升，除三夾板與前日相仿外，餘如洋松·木松片·杉木·坦戶·紅柳板等，一致漲起一成左右，惟其中杭木漲勢最烈，每兩由十三萬跳至十八萬，揀貨達廿萬之高，聞因被軍部收購廿萬根後，市存極感缺乏所致</p>

<p>皂火漲勢益厲，固本叩六萬六千元，暴漲四千元，美麗火柴以三十二萬元新高價收盤，亦暴漲七萬元，雜牌一很以十五萬元收市，均升萬元。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕英海軍足球隊有勇無謀，昨日下午四時在逸園第三次出馬，又以二比零敗於本市盟主青白隊。英軍雖控制全局，八十分鐘攻勢猛烈，竟不能獲中一球，負得鴨蛋歸去。青白則奇兵突出，上下半時各中一球，以二比零全勝。逸園相當熱閙，為英海軍三賽中，捧場最多者，約計當有二千餘人。</p>
<p>英海軍昨日陣容，又為一副新面目，三戰三變，仍未能博得一個勝利。昨日除原有倫敦號旗艦將士外，又加哥薩克斯艦球員數名，故實為一混合陣綫。全隊作風，始終保持英海軍之一貫政策，大刀闊斧，高球遠踢，攻勝於守，絕無拖泥帶水。惜乎攻勢雖猛，前鋒未曾帶來射門鞋子。青白門前，重重包圍，砰砰之聲，不絕而來，但竟不能破門一次，其射門之不準確有如此，而英海軍之敗北，其原因亦在此。英軍除中衛綫　相當堅强，昨日兩翼換了兩個哥薩克斯的新兵，矮子兩名，但跑得相當快。好幾次角球開得甚好，多未能有接應，青白戒備森嚴，一無成就。後衛只顧前進助攻，勇往直前，青白來一個突破，就束手無策，二次失球，都是犯同樣一個毛病。</p>
<p>青白守多於攻，結果是打了勝仗。上半時差不多全在英軍圍攻之下，黃仕傑面對砲彈球，接一連二而來，有數次險極之球，都經黃仕傑接仆搶跳，一一送出，使青白原璧未破，黃仕傑當居第一功。因英海軍之猛攻，孟義良不得不退居第三後衛，力保江山，有時中衛後衛在門前排班式的對付英軍，足見其攻勢之凶猛。前鋒後衛因此脫節，但是小羅還是最活躍，金祿生上半時中第一球，羅壽福下半時中第二球，憑他們聰明的小派司，終於壓倒敵人。</p>
<p>裁判張樂，巡邊何春暉·葛萊許，四時正英軍開球進攻，經青白阻襲，球去而復返，又到了青白陣地，英軍立刻用全力猛撲，中鋒西姆斯帶球直衝，孟義良上場刧奪，竟告仆地，西姆斯在門前二十碼處，對門一腳，球過橫木飛去。勃培奇捲土重來，亦遠山開砲，皆未獲中，已使青白受了虛驚。錢長榮在門前二次用左腳勾球，球竟倒向自己門前，幸黃仕傑救駕。英軍正攻得有勁，小羅橫裏殺出，截得來球，左右盤旋，帶球直進，一腳撥交金祿生，英軍後衛台特萊，見勢危急，從左趕來，金祿生對門猛射，適中台特萊腳上彈出，金再加一腳，泰特曼已無法挽救，五分鐘內英軍大門已告陷落。英軍并不因此一球而氣餒，仍舊猛烈進撲，攻勢不衰，兩翼尤為活躍，五鋒包圍青白，黃仕傑生意興隆，按應不暇。在孟義良率領之下，青白成了五個後衛。小羅偶有一次突破，劉體寅趕上，對門未中，深為可惜。一次英軍右翼慕爾，沿邊綫直進，騙過錢長榮，直奔門前，向中路一塞，潘脫遜一記勾射，險極，張仕傑躍起撲出。麥塞斯，勃培奇砲彈球，繼續不斷而來，皆落荒野逸。英軍腳頭不靈，徒勞無功，上半時四十分钟，青白一球佔先。</p>
<p>休息十分鐘再戰，局勢稍見改觀，英軍士氣，已不如前半時之旺盛，戰情遂見鬆馳。青白前鋒則出人頭地，在英軍陣地上活躍。兩方來往，凡五六分鐘，英軍自左路進逼，衝抵門前，姜閭前截住殺出，球向前傳，薛沛然獲得，一路衝開血路，盤球直進，深入英軍腹地，羅壽福也來一個接力賽，匹馬單槍，左一盤，右一盤，兩個後衛都被騙過，直抵門前，泰特曼束手待縛，對門一腳，英軍大門又陷。青白勝利奠定，勝來好像不費氣力。英軍雖還在攻打，顯見强弩之末。三十分鐘過去，兩點下來，最後十分鐘在平淡中結束。</p>

<p>籃聯甲組今日原有三場，其中甲一組兩幕，麥令斯重逢恩卡斯，華聯再遇回力。惟首仗麥恩之戰，因參加美海陸軍青年會拳擊錦標賽，雙方均請求改期，經籃委會予以核準，該場秩序取消并將開鑼戲甲二A組西青藍對康隊延至六時三十分開始。門票今日起調整為樓上五百，樓下一千，場內對號一千五百元。茲先錄秩序及裁判名單如下：</p>

<p>華聯-回力（甲一組）七時半　裁判陳寶琳　蔣吟僧</p>
<p>首仗甲二組康隊迎戰西青藍，康隊在老將陸大振領導下，擁有童廷煊，容承恩等好手，諸將大都年輕力壯，鬥力至見充沛，惟在該組中戰程編排迭逢勁敵，華東懋勛兩遭挫辱，雖勝又一但問鼎希望已鮮，西青藍先後兩戰，勝負各半，該隊球藝雖未見如何，但速度快，身手活，與康隊堪稱匹敵，屆時兩軍相會，必有劇戰。</p>
<p>繼之甲一組華聯再度與回力對壘，華聯海壖盟主，在本屆聯賽中雖一度失利於培斐爾，但其餘八仗盡行獲勝，故其首席地位仍得確保無慮。今晚重逢回力，原係手下敗將，實力戰略知之已詳，當可再奏凱歌。惟回力亦非阿蒙之謊，田福海曹志吉王永芳俱屬驍勇猛將，而自華雲山陳正淼等助戰以來，陣容亦見完整，首循受辱，含仇在胸，到時狹路必出全力以圖一逞，一場血戰難免也。茲將四隊名單附後：</p>

<p>〔香港十六日航訊〕網球，在香港漸漸狂熱起來了，很多運動圈中人，都高興拿起網球拍來學習，這次本球會主辦的網球錦標賽，是值得推崇的，真可以說，是站在「純體育的立場」上辦理的。</p>
<p>過了昨天的賽程，雙單打賽的初步淘汰工作，已經完成了。雙單打的最後八對「種子球員」相繼產生出來。</p>
<p>單打賽的八員單打選手，現在已經到了爭奪準決賽的階段。一向的例規：本球會辦公開賽，都是在準決賽時才收門劵的。</p>
<p>去年，本球會架搭棚座，希望多收一點門劵，但事與願違，葉觀雄因為天雨誤賽期，不能參加最後一場單打決賽（趕往上海參加全運），因此，收入遠不如理想的好。</p>
<p>目前的香港，真是一個奇跡，無論任何一個球賽，華人都佔了最大的優勢。單打的八員種子球員，僅得息格蘭，荷當，兩員是番將；雙打的最後八對，也僅得鐘士，愛雅士，息格蘭，史篤士兩對，有洋人的份兒，其餘，全是華將的天下了。</p>
<p>本屆的單雙打熱門冠軍，單打還是葉觀雄呼聲最高；雙打，則兩徐似有穩奪錦標的形勢。</p>
<p>就是為了這個原故，冠軍的得失，似已不會有大的變動，換一句話說，整個比賽的過程，只是平平淡淡的過去，也引不起球迷的高度興趣。</p>
<p>爪哇選手李文成，去年在歸國參加全運的時候，曾與乃弟文宣過港，當時，在曾本球會場表演，一般的觀察，都以為他會有前途。</p>
<p>今年，文成個人參加單打賽，更與陳德燦參加雙打賽，陳德燦也是一員「當紥」的球員，他如果參加單打賽的話，也會有一番「竄頭」</p>
<p>我覺得：德燦的高空擊球，和網前攔截，不會比文成差，而靱力則比文成好些。</p>
<p>談到「靱打」，去屆中，出了一個息格蘭，今年又多了一個區金滿；可惜金滿的氣力差些，否則，步陶冠球的後塵，以底綫長擊創另一風格的「打法」也會變為一員好手。</p>
<p>底綫長抽，如果打出有力而落點好，不但迫使對手無法上網，而且一樣要用長抽來應付，碰到對手不善於打這「一手球」的便是機會了。</p>

<p>— 戚公譯述</p>
<p>區域防禦制和移動區域防禦制不同，每位守衛者除負責自己所看管之區域外，這須要看全局之動向，與其他兩員守衛作默契，密切之聯絡，移動着位置來應變，要看對方三位進攻者之動態而定有默契之應付方式。這個方式是移動的，若果有純熟之演出及默契之合作，則有如扇形之擺動，採取主動之移動來打擾着持球進攻之球員。</p>
<p>在防禦戰術上言，人釘人制固屬重要，但在某種情形下，可由人釘人制而變化為移動區域防禦制的；致區域防禦制能使球員有清晰之演出，犯規之機會較少，收效較大；守衛的球員若富有預感力和看準對方之傳球動作，容易得到從中攔截對方前鋒傳球之機會；這個方式足以應付對方的各種進攻方法，假使對方前鋒不精於中距離投籃而是善於迫近籃下投入的，則防守區域可以特別掩護在籃下的附近的據點來防守，務使對方之前鋒在鑰匙孔眼罰球區域內不能得有衝入出手投籃之機會，假使對方前鋒是精於遠投的，則守衛應擴大防守區域。</p>
<p>移動區域防禦制固優於固定的區域防禦制，後者施用時收效甚微，對方前鋒三人若集在一個區域來采取攻勢，以一員守衛作固定式而拒三員前鋒，無異是以螳臂擋車，對方是以三對一攻破守方之固定防禦陣是易如反掌，所以，移動區域防禦的精髓所在，在下段詳細地分析出來。</p>
<p>移動區域禦防制亦有好幾種方式：各種有各種不同之打法，而每種都要看對方之前鋒進攻時所采用之方式而定有利於守衛之防守。現在，先談兩種有利於守衛之防禦方式。</p>
<p>（A）采用這個方式必須要一員人高腳長，機警，能够靈活地移動的球員來充當正中衛之職務。</p>
<p>他的位置是位在罰球界綫之前，管理籃圈的中心半圓周，半圓徑十五尺處，要設法阻撓對方之中鋒將球傳遞或從中路　入投籃；在對方中鋒向中路持球直趨時，正中衛要把持球者的前進速度遲緩下來，她可能將球傳給其間隊者，正中衛就須要拒該中鋒圓周之外，同時使其同時之兩守衛隨着球之所在而將陣形移動來取守勢。</p>
<p>在這種情況之下，其他兩員守衛因隨球之所在而全集中在左方來防守，甚或全集中在右方來防守，或分為左右兩路來采取守勢。</p>
<p>當對方前鋒是有衝入投籃之動作時，每一員守衛立卽變化為人釘人之防禦制，緊牢地釘着接近你的前鋒，而正中衛之職務是設法看管對方隨球進攻入陣之最後一位前鋒，阻撓着她不容易得到投籃之機會。</p>
<p>這個移動區域制的打法是滲入人釘人制的打法包括在內，運用起來較為複雜，而非初學球隊所易瞭解和運用，為着每位球員必須要腦筋清楚，分辯何時應采用移動區域防禦制，何時應臨機應變，因敵易形而改用人釘人制。</p>
<p>在這一種防禦制下，在　前不能指定每一個守衛者固定地看管着某一個區域，守衛者若要能够控制着所看管之區域得手，是要靠守衛者要有敏捷，巧妙之演出，且更須有精明之判斷力。（未完二）</p>
<h3 id="c143">感慨系之話球界 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>在茶室裏遇到一位并不相識的第一流球迷，互相傾談起來，他是如此健談，情感溢於言表，而且深有見地。</p>
<p>他說：不要說是戰後，卽使是遠遠的戰前，足球，這一行神聖的體育玩意兒，早已成為變態的體育「球閥」，作為經營賣買的生意工具哩！到了現在，生活的方法越來越緊縮，因而連帶把「足球名將」也變成了商品，由於「健將」所出賣的技術有高低，因此也就決定了這一個人材的聲價而已！</p>
<p>我當然不能一概抹煞，其真能為着體育而體育的亦有其人，但是在球場卽商場的氣氛中，大多數都抱着「不幹為俊傑」的下意識下，不敢經易嘗試，「明哲保身」之流，免卻惹人非議，於是寗願袖手旁觀，權作座上客。由是，真正懂辦體育的朋友越來越少，球隊之亂七八糟搞成了目前的局面。</p>
<p>同一個球員，可以在兩個會的「拉」和「誘」的情形下，手續尚未辦妥，竟然出賣的，拒絕出席，放棄被選，不願意本會的球員作地方比賽以免損傷，甚而至於為着不願擴大開支而節省「球員」弄到人馬不齊，這種奇形怪狀雖說是百分之三十有實在的理由外，敢保百分之七十是具着「不堪虧本」和「不願為人利用」的因素所造成的不痛快現象。</p>
<p>一個體育機關的存在，在原則上是神聖的，但是，因有門票的收入，引起了部份獨具生意眼者的偏見，這個收入的來龍去脈，幾經盤算，利慾驚心於是搞成拉攏的畸形發展，擁有技術的健將，那得不「深明利害」而作待價而沽擇厚而就，於是現成目前的本港的三種足球方式，一·超然式的業餘化，二·含糊的半職業化，三·公開式的職業化。</p>
<p>第一種，在會的本質，勝負不計，來者歡迎，去者不留，錦標不强求，悠閒自得，這一種脫俗的作風，當然，在技術進取方面，成就了多少團體的技術貢獻，理由是真正堅貞自負的人材實在太少，卽使埋頭苦幹，稍有起色，孰不知螳螂在後。主持者抱着這種為人作嫁的不值，於是馬虎從事，缺乏了再接再厲助人自助的天責，他們放棄了崗位，也是阻塞人材的消極組織。</p>
<p>第二種可說是專門製造體壇陰霾新聞的體育機關，因為是半開半閉，當然，吸收着一批等級不同的各式名手，人材最複雜，方式也就雜亂無章，主持者以各種不同的面色和手腕牢籠着，晨夕不安，卽使突然有一兩位新血發現，在待遇的厚此薄彼，或者是負責者故弄玄虛，終於引成不辭而別，放棄出席，或在討價還價的動搖狀態中，根本就無從發展整個隊伍的具體戰術。</p>
<p>第三種應該是代表着整個地方技術水準的測量器。組織當然最健全，資本應該最濃厚，卽使用生意眼的目光來估斷，其所獲的結果照理應該也是「名利雙收」。可是，事實還是不能作如許的樂觀。我相信主持者還是逃不了「叫苦連天」，自怨自艾，問題是香港已缺乏第一流的洋隊作為對手，華華內閧又怎樣？全港的精華已劃分得太清楚，宿將與新卒，相對的實力遠殊，一面倒，絕無欣賞的價值，觀眾不感興趣，收入當然受影響，於是龐大的開支，未必就可以寫寫意意彌補了開支。在技術方面，便是每況愈下，老實說，技術精益求精是從苦苦掙扎中鍛鍊出來的，在為所欲為的場合下比賽，足球水準那得不往下坡走</p>
<p>這些破落的現象，可以說都是從整個體育社會結構傳下來的不良傳統。這種惡俗的風氣一日存在，足球技術水準一日不能進取，我認為，在目前的足球體壇，欲完全職業在還不够人材與球隊的話，體協會應該站起來盡最大的努力，督促機關，實行球員的均配制，授與球員適合的職業，與母會的關係，作一個固定合理的調整，球會本着以體育得來的錢用於體育，球員本着深造的精神深造，在各會實力平均的目標下互相切磋，大家以足球技術為前題，香港足球是否有光輝的成就，且看我們這一批，站在體育崗位上的工作者是否能不時反省和檢討而已！（尤辛農寄自香島）</p>

<h3 id="c144">談民歌 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 桑</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，各地—尤其是蒙新等地的民歌，也都隨着復員而帶到江南的京滬地帶來了。民歌是民族健康的聲音，不但在歌詞裏可以看到一地的風俗習慣及地理環境，且從它的譜曲裏，也更可以見到當地人民的民族性及其樸質的文化。例是蒙新的民歌，往往有駝駱和草原等名詞，綏遠等地的民歌，就常常提起長城的城頭了。</p>
<p>民歌的曲調都很簡單，它的伴奏樂器也同樣的簡單。因為民歌的發生，原是在大草原上，沙澳或是山野間，因衆人的應和而產生的。所以雖然大多數的民歌都脫離不了男女之情，但只有樸實的原始氣味，而沒有一點黃色的成份滲雜在內。</p>
<p>近來許多正統的音樂家們，也都漸漸地注意並研究這些民歌了。管夫人灌唱的「跑馬溜溜」，「沙里紅巴哀」，「靑春舞曲」之類，就是這個趨勢的表示。可惜的是上海人唱民歌，往往也帶上了點「靡靡」之音，這不但有負於提倡人的苦心，同時也元全失去了民歌的意義了。</p>
<p>有些音樂家除了從民間價正採擷民歌外，同時更想用「以果為因」的方法，來推廣它。就是先依了各地的民情製就詞譜，然後再推之於民間。「大家唱」，「茶館小調」等，就是這種方法的產物。</p>
<p>這一個方法，如果由眞正深人民間的作曲家們來担任，當然對民歌是一種有力的帮助；否則的話，就不免要流於「矯情」。而更有一般市儈式的音樂販子們，趁了這個機會，大量的攙入黃色色素，這就不但抹煞了民歌的優點，並且對於民歌的前途，亦是一大障礙了。</p>
<h3 id="c145">離婚能避免嗎 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 賓芝</p>
<p>離婚，是家庭間不幸之事。雖然在法律上可以允許，但在人情上總覺有幾分不愉快。就是法官，處理這種案件，也要滲入些感情的因素，決不輕易讓一對當初恩愛的夫婦，生生分開。</p>
<p>克寗漢是一個法官，從他的經騐中，得到了一個處理離婚案件的結論：從家庭關係中來調解，比在法庭上審理更來得有效。他曾在一月內經辦的七十七件離婚案子中嘗試他的理論，結果有十八件是完全和解了；有三十五件，他要求他們再同居一二個月，後來也得到和解；祗有二十四對反目的夫婦，實在無法調解，祗得離異了。</p>
<p>克寗漢審理離婚案件，先問男女兩造，有無和解的可能。假使有一造認為可以和解的，就不再審問了。他引這一對夫婦和他們的律師到另外一間房間裏去，舉行談判。但男女當事人的父母是不准參加的·克寗漢可能在十五分鐘內，說得這一對夫婦和好如初。他利用各種機會，解釋離婚後可能的遭遇。對女的說：你在離婚後另行結婚，新的丈夫對前夫所生的子女會感到不滿，嫉妒，虐待，你能忍受麼？對男的說：離婚以後，你要付出前妻的贍養費，同時家庭的開支仍不能减少，要使你負担加重。同時，你要付給前妻贍養費，後妻會給你囉囌麻煩。但這種說話，對沒有子女的年靑夫婦，是不甚有效的。他們不信離婚後的種種煩惱和苦楚，所以常會引起爭辯，給果還是離婚了事。</p>
<p>用克寗漢的辦法，據他自己說，調解能不能成功，就看最初的十五分鐘。若在這一段時間內，雙方仍認為沒有和解的可能，較有一方性情過激，和解的希望就很少了。最好辦的，是年靑而有孩子的夫婦。有一次，一對年靑夫婦，進來時怒目而視，到出去時，却愛好非凡。他們對克寗漢說：我們已將方才進來時的情景，忘記得乾乾淨淨了。</p>

<p>西京雜記，有紀載泰宮珍寳一段，說：「高祖入咸陽宮，周行庫府，金玉珍寳，不可稱言。有方鏡，廣四尺，高五尺九寸，表裏有明，，人直來照之，影則倒見。以手捫心而來，則見腸胃五臟，歷然無硋。人有疾病在內，掩心而照之，則知病之所在。又女子有邪心，則膽張心動。秦始皇常以照宮人，膽張心動者則殺之。高祖以待項羽，羽併將以東，後不知所在。」據這一段紀載，倒有點像今日的「X」光，而能照見「女子邪心」，則其功效更過於「X」光矣。可惜項羽併將以東，不知所在，否則可以一照今人的「良心」，是否存在？是白是黑？若在通衢大道懸上一面，俯照衆生，想來必是漆黑一片吧。</p>

<p>— 談客</p>
<p>三月份的計口配售食米證，須將國民身份證上的第「七」號購物證倒換。小民於欣幸購物證終竟「派了用塲」之餘，對於官家的這種架床疊屋之舉，眞有點莫名其妙之感。</p>
<p>一個月共總配售十五市斤食米，為了學時髦（漲價），把十五市斤的配售食米分三次配售，以便跟踪市價而有所伸縮，——事實上當然只有伸沒有縮，這且不提，因為至少還存在着某種理由。惟獨憑購物證來倒換配售證的這一套花樣，太令人費解了。旣須憑購物證才領得着食米配售證，且必須是七號，則何不就直截了當的憑購物證配米？多此一舉的用意何在呢？難道每個人的國民身份證上可能有兩張七號的購物證嗎？如果說仍分三次配米吧，難道預定每月十二張的購物證還不够用嗎？</p>
<p>此舉也，在杜絕舞弊的意義上講，可謂是百分之百的虛空。直截了當的憑購物證配米，也決不會使承印配售證的商家關門。把這筆印刷紙張費用移作有意義而必需的開支，豈不好得多！</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Cabinet May Offer a Fresh Start; He Yingqin Actively Forming the Cabinet; Justice Minister Zhang Shizhao, Secretary-General Huang Shaogu, Deputy Secretary-General Ni JiongSheng; Other Ministry Heads Being Invited <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] He Yingqin's new cabinet will appear with a detached attitude. Mr. He is currently adhering to this principle, inviting detached individuals to join the cabinet; he especially emphasizes the use of new talent, so that the cabinet formed under this most difficult situation can give the people a fresh start. Mr. He spent the entire 16th running around to various parties for the sake of forming the cabinet, while also using long-distance telephone calls to earnestly invite individuals from Guangzhou and Shanghai to join the cabinet. Mr. He also invited Legislative Yuan members Huang Yuren, Yin Shuxian, Huang Shaogu, Xu Gongshui, Wang Qijiang, Tang Ruyan, etc. to his official residence at 10:00 AM on the 16th to exchange opinions on forming the cabinet. Mr. He explained the preparations for forming the cabinet in detail, which lasted for two hours before the meeting adjourned. In the afternoon, Chen Cheng, Wang Lingji, and others visited separately. After a brief conversation, Mr. He left at 5:30 PM to visit the presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, Tong Guanxian and Yu Youren, returning to his official residence around 6:00 PM. It is learned that the scope of individuals invited to join the new cabinet is very wide. For example, for the position of Minister of Education, the opinions of Mei Yiqi, Li Shuhua, Wu Yifang, and others have been sought separately. The Minister of Foreign Affairs has also successively invited Hu Shi, Fu Bingchang, and others. No conclusions were reached as of the evening of the 16th. Broadly speaking, only the appointment of Zhang Shizhao as Minister of Justice, Huang Shaogu as Secretary-General, and Ni Jiongsheng as Deputy Secretary-General have been finalized. Fu Bingchang for Foreign Affairs and Li Hanhun for Internal Affairs are also highly likely. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, with its newly established extensive powers, is proving difficult to find a suitable candidate for; although Weng Wenhao was invited, he declined. The candidates for the Ministries of Finance, Education, and Transportation, as well as the heads of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, have not yet been finalized. Former Minister of Water Resources Xue Mabizhi was strongly urged by Mr. He to join the cabinet and head the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but Xue declined. Although Mr. He's principles for forming the cabinet have been determined, he still faces many difficulties in practice. If all the invited individuals decline on various pretexts, then the new cabinet with a reformist style will be difficult to establish overnight.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Bai Yunti, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, arrived in Nanjing by plane from Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 16th. After disembarking, Mr. Bai immediately went to Doujizha to visit Premier He.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Chen Cheng, Chairman of Taiwan Province, and Zhu Shaoliang, Chairman of Fujian Province, arrived in Nanjing at 11:50 AM on the morning of the 16th aboard a special Tianxiong aircraft. Mr. Chen left Taiwan on the 15th and flew to Fujian, arriving in Fuzhou that day. He then flew to Nanjing from Fuzhou on the morning of the 16th with Mr. Zhu. Acting President Li specially appointed Li Hanhun as his representative, and He Yingqin sent Gong Yu as his representative to welcome them. Bai Chongxi, Gu Zhutong, Xu Yongchang, Zhou Zhirou, and others also came to greet them. Mr. Chen was in good spirits, but his expression was noticeably more solemn than in the past. At the airport, he only told visiting reporters: "This trip is at the invitation of Acting President Li to come to Nanjing. All matters can only be decided after seeking instructions." Mr. Chen then accepted Bai Chongxi's invitation to lunch at Mr. Bai's residence. He visited Acting President Li around 1:00 PM, Premier He again around 4:00 PM, and Gu Zhutong and others again in the evening. It is also reported that Mr. Chen has decided to return to Taiwan on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Sichuan Chairman Wang Lingji and Chongqing Mayor Yang Sen arrived in Nanjing by special plane at 11:20 AM on the morning of the 16th from Chongqing in response to a telegram from Acting President Li. After resting briefly and having lunch, the two men went to Fuhougang at 2:30 PM in the afternoon to visit Acting President Li and report on the political situation in Sichuan and Chongqing. Both Wang and Yang expressed to Acting President Li that local authorities would completely obey the central government regarding major policies on peace and war; however, they hoped that the central government would help resolve some difficult issues in local administration. The two men visited Premier He at 2:00 PM in the afternoon and Finance Minister Xu Kan in the evening, where they had some discussions. According to Chairman Wang's remarks to reporters on the evening of the 16th, he came to Nanjing in response to a telegram from Acting President Li to receive instructions and to present some difficulties in local administration. The situation in Sichuan is currently stable, but student unrest has been occurring frequently, demanding increased pay. The provincial government is trying to resolve the issue, but has not yet been able to quell the student unrest. He has asked Acting President Li and Premier He for instructions, hoping that the central government can assist in resolving the pay issue. In addition, he will also request industrial loans and salt loans from the Ministry of Finance to solve the difficulties in the salt industry. As for the matter of Hu Zongnan's troops entering Sichuan, it is a false rumor and there is no such thing.</p>

In the end, they decided that although the party agreed to participate in the He Yingqin cabinet, since the current organization of the Executive Yuan has not yet been determined, they decided to adopt a reserved attitude for the time being. They will convene a Central Standing Committee meeting to discuss the technical issues of participation after the structure of the Executive Yuan is finalized.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Zhang Junmai originally planned to go to Nanjing on the 18th to visit the authorities and discuss national affairs, but he has now accepted his doctor's advice and postponed his trip. In addition, the Minsha Party is scheduled to hold a Central Standing Committee meeting in a day or two. All the members of the Standing Committee in Nanjing will return to Shanghai to attend. At that time, they will decide whether the party will participate in the new cabinet, and Mr. Zhang's trip to Nanjing will take place after the Standing Committee meeting.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Zuoming 16th Dispatch] Yang Jie, a military strategist and former ambassador to the Soviet Union, has been living in seclusion at home for many years. The central authorities intend to entrust him with an important task. Acting President Li is even more eager for Mr. Yang to come out of retirement and has sent two telegrams through Bai Chongxi urging him to come. The wording is sincere and persuasive, stating: "The current situation is critical and calls for a concerted effort to save the country. Your brother's strategic talent has long been admired. We urgently hope that you will come to Nanjing to discuss national affairs," etc. It is reported that Mr. Yang is considering going to Nanjing.</p>

Regarding the two opinions of Bai Chongxi advocating for preparing for war while seeking peace and Acting President Li's "ceasing war while seeking peace," he stated that it is appropriate for Acting President Li, in his position as head of state, to adopt an attitude of ceasing war while seeking peace, and it is also appropriate for Mr. Bai to talk about preparing for war while seeking peace as a military man. In short, peace is what everyone needs, and it is good to have genuine peace.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 16th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan held its 48th Yuan meeting on the 16th, chaired by Wu Tiecheng. State Councilors Zhang Qun and Zhang Lisheng and the heads of various ministries and commissions attended.

This had been approved by a resolution of the Executive Yuan meeting. The results of the consultation among relevant ministries and commissions were submitted and passed at the 48th Yuan meeting on the 16th: (1) The various in-kind allowances for public and educational personnel in various regions will be priced according to the limited prices of August 19, and a base number will be determined, which will be allocated monthly according to the multiple of salary.

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] The political atmosphere in the capital is quite thick, becoming active due to the arrival of military and political personnel from various regions. Acting President Li presides over meetings morning and evening to discuss important issues. The meeting held at the Ministry of National Defense at 9:00 AM was presided over by Acting President Li, and He Yingqin, Xu Yongchang, Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, and others attended. The nature of the meeting was a military conference. It is generally believed that the Communist army is currently arrayed along the riverbank, preparing to cross the river, and peace talks must be conducted after the new cabinet is formed. Therefore, a thorough review of the overall situation must be made. In the afternoon, Acting President Li received Chen Cheng, Wang Lingji, and others at his official residence, and in the evening, he invited some members of the Legislative Yuan to a discussion meeting again at 9:00 PM. It is reported that Acting President Li is very concerned about the simplification of the structure of the Executive Yuan, especially the large organization of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which is very difficult to find a suitable leader for, and is also extremely difficult in terms of operations. On the other hand, after the number of ministries and commissions in the Executive Yuan is reduced, the possibility of enlisting members of various parties and political figures from social elites to join the cabinet will be reduced, which will affect the representativeness of the government. Therefore, Acting President Li discussed this main point at the meeting with members of the Legislative Yuan on the evening of the 16th, seeking a legal procedure to solve the difficulty. It was originally intended to adopt the method of submitting a reconsideration proposal by the Legislative Yuan meeting to make changes, but after research, it was believed that since the case had already been decided, it was not necessary to change it, and the proposal for reconsideration was cancelled. More than 20 people, including Chen Guangwen, Yuan Qijiong, Yin Shuxian, and Tu Gongshui, were invited to attend, and the meeting adjourned around 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Well-informed political observers here predict that if the government's peace talks delegation does not go to Beiping soon, the CCP will issue an ultimatum to the Nanjing government. People here point out the following signs to show that a new crisis in China is actively brewing: (1) Chen Yi's 19th Army Corps, with more than 300,000 troops, has been arrayed on the north bank of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, preparing to begin crossing the river; (2) CCP leaders believe that the National Army on the Yangtze River will not offer resolute resistance; (3) The CCP cannot afford to wait politically for indefinitely postponed peace talks. If the Communist Party wants to use military force to defeat Nanjing, it must achieve its goals at the peace talks table, and now is the right time. If the CCP waits any longer, the He Yingqin cabinet and the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan in Nanjing will put the country back on the right track of revival and regain some of the people's support. According to some sources, the government must formally express its willingness to start peace talks with the CCP no later than the 20th of this month. The resignation of the Sun Ke cabinet has delayed the preparations for peace talks for a considerable period. From the CCP's point of view, the only concern about launching a new offensive is the possibility of causing resentment among the war-weary people. However, at the peace talks table, this resentment can also be used by the CCP as a factor in its favor, forcing the Nationalist government to accept the conditions proposed by the CCP in order to take care of public opinion. He Yingqin's strategy must be to agree at the peace talks table to allow the CCP to control the future coalition government, but to try to retain the KMT's power in local administration.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing 16th Dispatch] The newly appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin, is busy today organizing a "peace cabinet" in the hope of starting peace talks with the CCP as soon as possible. Since arriving in Nanjing, Mr. He has held several meetings with Acting President Li to discuss the members of the cabinet, so that the government can unite internally and be consistent externally. Chen Cheng and Zhu Shaoliang flew to Nanjing this morning, which may be a prelude to closer cooperation between the Southeast Group and the government, greatly enhancing the status of Mr. He's future cabinet. It is reported that Wu Tiecheng is in Guangzhou urging Guangdong Chairman Xue Yue and Pacification Director Yu Hanmou to join the cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="e11">The Whereabouts of the Chongqing Warship Remain a Mystery; Gui Yongqing Believes It Is Still Moored in the Bohai Bay; Supervisory Committee Members Will Propose an Impeachment Against Mr. Gui <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Supervisory Committee members Sun Yulin, Zhang Dinghua, and others believe that Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing was negligent in preventing the defection of the Chongqing warship and failed to provide reasonable treatment to the officers and soldiers of the ship, resulting in this incident. Mr. Gui should be held responsible and a decision has been made to propose an impeachment against him. They are currently soliciting signatures from various committee members.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing told the press on the 16th that the mystery of the "Chongqing" warship seems to be about to be revealed. He said that the "Chongqing," which defected last month, is still moored in the Bohai Bay. Due to the limitations of international law, the ship has not sailed to Dalian. Mr. Gui also denied that the ship had been sunk by National Army aircraft.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Since the cruiser Chongqing defected from Shanghai on February 26, its whereabouts, although once discovered by the Air Force in Yantai Port, have since been declared "missing." Currently, it has been confirmed by a third party that the ship is not in Dalian, and the Air Force, adhering to national treaties, has not been able to conduct an aerial survey over Lushun Port. According to the Navy Headquarters' judgment, the ship is likely still hiding in the Bohai Bay area, waiting for an opportunity to escape further. Although the Navy Headquarters is still trying to recall the ship by radio without investigating the responsibility for its defection, qualified sources believe that the ship is currently controlled solely by the original crew of naval officers and soldiers, mixed with about 300 Communist soldiers who boarded the ship in Yantai to "assist." The ship sailed out of Shanghai under orders to go to Taiwan, carrying 300,000 silver dollars in the Navy's emergency fund, to be distributed to the Navy units in Taiwan. The newly appointed captain was Lu Dongge, the original Operations Director of the Third Department of the Navy Headquarters. The original captain, Deng Zhaoxiang, was transferred to Deputy Director of the First Department of the Navy Headquarters and was ordered to assist Captain Lu on the ship for three months before the transfer, so that Lu would be familiar with the characteristics of the ship.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Unofficial reliable sources say that National Army aircraft have indeed attempted to sink the Chongqing cruiser, which defected to the Communists, three times. The ship is currently hiding near Dalian in the Bohai Sea, protected by Dalian's Soviet anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Legislative Yuan Committee Reviewed the Case of Stopping the Price Increase of Transportation Enterprises Yesterday; Intends to Establish Eight Principles to Investigate Responsibility <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan recently resolved to request the Executive Yuan to quickly stop the price increase of transportation enterprises and not to recognize the prices announced on the 11th. The Executive Yuan's office in Nanjing has replied to the Legislative Yuan, saying that it has notified Ling Hongxun, Vice Minister of Transportation in Guangzhou, by telephone to handle the matter. The Legislative Yuan also telegraphed Mr. Ling on the 16th, asking him to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 18th to report on the reasons for the price increase of postal, telecommunications, and railway services and to be prepared for questioning. In addition, Mr. Ling telegraphed President Tong on the 15th, explaining the reasons for the price increase of postal, telecommunications, and railway services, stating: "In recent years, the fees charged by railways, postal services, and telecommunications have been too low, and income and expenditure cannot be balanced. It is necessary for the national treasury to provide large subsidies and adjust the rates at any time in order to maintain them. According to the formula, the rates for public utilities are proposed in accordance with Article 20 of the National State-Owned Enterprise Management Law. If they are adjusted once every ten days, the amount will be small. If the adjustment time is delayed, the amount will be large, which will inevitably stimulate prices and cause public criticism. This case is of great importance to the survival of transportation. I would like to ask for your support." The telegram was reviewed by the relevant committee on the 16th, and it was submitted to the Yuan meeting to consult the Executive Yuan to investigate the responsibility.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan's subcommittee responsible for reviewing the price increase of railways, postal services, and telecommunications held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 16th. Yuan Qijiong presided over the meeting. Various committee members spoke one after another, all criticizing the Ministry of Transportation for this matter and pointing out that the railway price increase has been the most severe since the "August 19" price limit, reaching 1,650 times. As a result, railway fares are too high, and people cannot afford to ride, especially the first and second class passengers are few. After a long discussion, eight principles were drafted and submitted to the Yuan meeting on the 18th for discussion. The principles are as follows: (1) Telegrams, telephones, and railways should be calculated according to the cost of living index for civil servants. (2) The "August 19" price should be used as the base number. (3) The adjustment time should be one month or half a month, to be decided by the Yuan meeting. The adjustment time should start from April 1. (4) Adjustments should be made separately according to region. (5) In terms of postal services, before the postal regulations are revised, the provisions of the postal law should still apply, and each adjustment should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. (6) The review opinions on Vice Minister Ling's telegram to the Ministry of Transportation were discussed and resolved to consult the Executive Yuan to investigate the responsibility and investigate and deal with it in order to uphold the rule of law. (7) The postal rate increase shall be implemented from April 1 in accordance with the new price on March 11. (8) The subsidy funds approved by the government for state-owned transportation enterprises should be allocated by the Ministry of Finance before the 5th of each month according to the subsidy amount for the previous month, and the insufficient amount should be allocated in one lump sum on the 5th of the following month. (9) State-owned transportation enterprises should pay for all military transportation and military telecommunications costs in cash. State-owned transportation enterprises should eliminate redundant personnel and tighten expenditures. The organization should be restored to pre-war standards.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] The Supervisory Yuan is concerned about the policy guidelines and cabinet member candidates of the He Yingqin cabinet. At the annual meeting on the 16th, committee members Chen Yunge and 19 others proposed an emergency motion requesting to change the agenda and conduct a political review in order to provide opinions on the policy guidelines and cabinet member candidates of the He cabinet. After discussion, it was believed that since the He cabinet has not yet been formed, the Supervisory Yuan can only express its opinions in a personal way. The final decision was that Yuan Wei Yu would host a banquet for Mr. He in a day or two, inviting some Supervisory Committee members to accompany him. During the banquet, the Supervisory Committee members would separately provide opinions to Premier He on the policy guidelines and cabinet member candidates.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Two Supervisory Committee Members Refute Zhang Zhaoyuan's Remarks on the Lan Ni Dyestuff Case; Saying They Are Collecting Evidence and Will Propose an Impeachment <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] After Zhang Zhaoyuan, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling Enemy and Puppet Property, made remarks in Shanghai regarding the Lan Ni dyestuff case, the original proposers of the case, Supervisory Committee members Xiong Zaiwei and Jin Yueguang, believed that Zhang's remarks were clearly intended to protect the Lan case. They are currently collecting evidence and will propose an impeachment against Zhang. The two men also met with reporters on the 16th and issued the following statement: The whole story has been detailed in the report, and the evidence is conclusive, so there is no need to argue. However, (1) The confiscated dyestuffs were the dyestuffs of Le Runting of the Welfare Company, which is proven by the warehouse receipt and has nothing to do with Ms. Lan, let alone the issue of whether she is a traitor prepared by the Ministry of Justice. The so-called owner, Ms. Lan, is clearly not a fact. (2) Le Runting is the holder of the warehouse receipt, and the warehouse receipt also states the words Le Runting. Even his repeated confessions have not involved any relationship with Ms. Lan. Moreover, the confiscated dyestuffs are vulcanized yellow and indigo, but Ms. Lan's application for return repeatedly claimed that they were indanthrene indigo blue, which are not only different in type, but also differ in price by a hundred times. Whether the dyestuffs are enemy and puppet property is one thing, but there is no doubt that they do not belong to Lan Ni. (3) The so-called "not a single penny has been returned" is because after the case reached Shanghai, public opinion was in an uproar, and the Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Anhui Cleaning Bureau for Handling Enemy and Puppet Property did not dare to make a decision rashly. It was also caused by the fact that I asked them to postpone the return during the investigation. However, this is not related to the establishment of Sun Ke's illegal misconduct in handling the case. As for the fact that the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling Enemy and Puppet Property took the President's instructions and made illegal resolutions, a telegram was sent to the Guangzhou Executive Office to transfer the files. According to the reply from the Executive Yuan, the files are still in Nanjing, and there is no fixed office in Nanjing. The chairman of the committee, Zhang Zhaoyuan, sometimes disperses to Guangdong, sometimes hosts banquets in Nanjing, and sometimes makes remarks in Shanghai. His whereabouts are uncertain, and there is no way to inquire. Therefore, the relevant parts of the committee have not yet been closed. However, the relationship between the official and Sun Ke and Lan Ni is well known to everyone. He is flattering women and helping tyrants, and he is already unable to escape legal sanctions. Now, he does not hesitate to fabricate facts and protect them, which is even more shameful. I am currently proposing an impeachment.</p>

<p>[This City News] According to Ms. Lan Caizhen, the person concerned in the dyestuff case: I have investigated that the Enemy and Puppet Property Cleaning Office seized 84 barrels of my dyestuffs, which I purchased in August 1945 and have a warehouse receipt as proof, and there are also witnesses to testify. After the victory, I registered according to law. According to Shanghai business customs, whoever holds the warehouse receipt for goods is the legal owner of the goods. If the Cleaning Office believes that these dyestuffs do not belong to me, why has it not produced any counter-evidence? Since I am the legal owner of the dyestuffs, I immediately requested that they be unsealed and returned when the Cleaning Office seized them. For three years, I have been constantly trying to do so. However, the government has been reorganized many times, and the matter has been delayed. As a result, I have not yet received the government's approval for return, nor have I received a penny of return. The material and spiritual losses I have suffered are enormous, which is very regrettable. If the government does not give this case a fair hearing, I will have to resort to legal means to seek relief.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] After the adjournment of the Supervisory Yuan meeting at noon on the 16th, Vice President Liu Zheji staged another martial arts drama of beating people. At that time, Liu was talking with female Supervisory Committee member Cui Shuyan about the Northeast Relief Fund in front of the meeting venue.

Fortunately, female Supervisory Committee member Song Ying and others were present and quickly dissuaded him and helped Cui into Liu's car and drove away quickly. Liu had no choice but to leave the Yuan in another jeep. At the afternoon meeting, female Supervisory Committee members such as Song Ying wanted to propose a temporary motion, accusing Liu of insulting committee members and beating people again, and asking all the committee members to comment.

<h3 id="e20">Editorial: Curbing Unrestrained Price Hikes in the Transportation Sector <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The recent price increases in state-run railways, postal services, and telecommunications, which took effect on the 11th of this month, have had a significant and heavy impact on public sentiment and the market. The legislators currently meeting in Nanjing consider the unrestrained price hikes in railways, postal services, and telecommunications to be unreasonable and immediately convened a meeting to resolve not to recognize them, and requested the Executive Yuan to restrain them. During the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 14th, over a hundred legislators, including Niu Jianchu, proposed an emergency motion, "To restrain the price increases in the transportation sector, which the Executive Yuan has not yet implemented, and propose to take effective measures," which was submitted for discussion on the 15th. According to Legislator Niu, price increases in the transportation sector have rarely been discussed in the Legislative Yuan in the past and have always been presented as fait accompli. The last time the Legislative Yuan passed a motion to restrain price increases in the transportation sector, the Ministry of Transportation was restrained by you; as soon as the price increase occurred, he immediately telephoned the Minister of Transportation to report to the Legislative Yuan why he had not received the resolution of the Legislative Yuan to restrain price increases; (2) he then consulted the Executive Yuan to immediately revoke the recently announced train and postal prices of the Ministry of Transportation. The legislators unanimously agreed with the proposal and decided to change it into a question-and-answer session, which means that they want to investigate the responsibility for the price increases in the transportation sector from a legal and administrative point of view; but recalling the fact that it is constituted, they have to let it increase the price freely. If so, then this precedent is set, and in the future, you can ask questions as you like, and I will increase the price as I like. What can the Legislative Yuan do?</p>
<p>Railways, postal services, and telecommunications belong to the state-run transportation sector. From the perspective of its relationship with people's lives and social functions, it is a public utility, like urban water, electricity, and gas. This kind of public utility must be exclusively owned by the state, not a state patent. All activities related to it and its price increases and decreases must be subject to state and local control to prevent the public utility monopoly from becoming a private monopoly; and to avoid the public patent from becoming a private patent, which would completely lose the effectiveness of the public utility. In the years since the war, various public utilities have been affected by price fluctuations and high raw material prices, and there have been unrestrained price increase measures. Each price increase inevitably affects the rise of general prices. Although public utility operators and public administrative agencies explain the price increases of public utilities as being compelled by circumstances, public opinion does not forgive this explanation. From the perspective of facts and theory, it is inherently unforgivable.</p>
<p>However, like this time's price increases in state-run transportation, public opinion has expressed indignation, legislators have raised questions, and supervisory committee members are preparing to impeach, because its unrestrained price increases are based on unreasonableness, and of course, it must bear the opposition of society and the impeachment of the Legislative Yuan. Why is it said to be unreasonable? The reasons are no more than three points: (1) The transportation sector is a monopoly enterprise related to social welfare. This monopoly enterprise aims to facilitate the people, invigorate transportation, and communicate culture. It is a public utility that is publicly owned and publicly needed. Its price should not be used as a means of monopoly or for the purpose of profit. Even if there is a considerable loss, the state should provide legitimate subsidies and should not pass this loss on to the people. (2) If a price increase is necessary, in legal procedures, according to Article 20 of the "State-Owned Enterprise Management Law," the price increase proposal should be submitted to the legislative process to obtain legal support. The Legislative Yuan does not completely oppose price increases. As long as it takes into account the affordability of the public and increases the price moderately in a fair and progressive manner, the purpose of the price increase can be achieved. (3) Currently, the efficiency of general public utilities is too low, there are too many employees, expenses are too high, accounting has never been supervised, and management skills are also lacking. It should be thoroughly improved, redundant personnel should be cut, expenses should be reduced, and revenue and expenditure should be balanced. These three reasons are not only about the management policy of public utilities but also about general socio-economic policies.</p>
<p>This time's price increases in the state-run transportation sector seem to have constituted a fait accompli. Although the Legislative Yuan has vehemently opposed it, it is feared that the recently announced new prices cannot be revoked. The question now is how to seek rationalization of management and curb price increases in the transportation sector from active facilities, which is more in line with the requirements of reality. The transportation sectors of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are all monopolies, and their national transportation sectors' code of ethics aims at social service. Their management is scientific and rational, and the people have no complaints, and the government can govern with ease, without hurting each other's brains. Why are their people so happy? This is because they have a democratic and progressive government, and the socio-economic policies implemented by this government emphasize management and efficiency, so the transportation sector and all public utilities can meet scientific and rational standards.</p>
<p>Now, President He's organization of the new cabinet is about to be completed. He has always paid close attention to transportation management and has had brilliant achievements in managing military transportation during the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, we hope that the He cabinet in the future, under the goals of political innovation and economic innovation, will focus on adjusting transportation and managing transportation, and strive to rationalize the management of state-run transportation and curb the unrestrained price increases in the transportation sector from active facilities!</p>

<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Xinyang, 16th] The National Army in southern Henan has taken strategic contingency measures to closely monitor the Chen Geng Corps advancing southward along the east side of the Pinghan Railway. According to military sources: Four divisions of the National Army and more than 100,000 local forces in Henan Province have completed new deployments on the line from Queshan in the north to Macheng in eastern Hubei on the 16th, and have also placed more than tens of thousands of local teams to maneuver in Zhumadian. Queshan, Zhengyang, and Luoshan echo each other from afar. According to this observation: The National Army took the initiative to withdraw from Luoshan (90 li from Xinyang) on the night of the 16th, and part of the National Army retreated from Queshan County to the suburbs today. In strategic deployment, it has great value. (2) News tonight: 4,000 Communist troops entered Luoshan. After the National Army took the initiative to withdraw from Queshan and Zhumadian north of Xinyang, the local Communist troops have taken the opportunity to act. A large army is now gathered in Xinyang, but the people are still at peace.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Xinyang, 16th] The Fourth Corps of the Chen Geng Corps, about 10,000 people, advanced towards Zhengyang in three routes on the 15th. The First Security Brigade stationed in the city and reinforcements of the National Army, due to the disparity in numbers and the prominent terrain, had retreated to Minggang on the 16th. The external telecommunications of the city suddenly reported interruption this morning.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Xinyang, 16th] The Liu Bocheng Corps and the Chen Geng Corps, with more than 20,000 troops, advancing southeast from Runan, continued to have a contingent of about 15,000 people arrive in Huangchuan on the morning of the 16th. Including the Communist troops who advanced to the southwest of Huangchuan and infiltrated into the territory of Macheng County, the Communist troops advancing south are close to 40,000, and the situation in southern Henan and eastern Hubei is becoming increasingly tense.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] Amidst widespread reports that a large number of Communist troops in central China are moving south, General Bai Chongxi, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army in central China, is scheduled to return to Hankou in the near future. When asked by reporters whether the Communist troops would launch an offensive in the central China area, Bai said: It seems impossible in the current situation. But Bai emphasized that the future is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Qualified sources pointed out that the nineteen columns of Chen Yi's troops are currently stationed on the north bank of the Yangtze River in the Jiangsu-Anhui border area, providing a huge political capital that can immediately change the situation in the Baoma negotiations. This political stake has been advancing slowly in the winter mud in northern Jiangsu for two months, regardless of wind and rain, and has been bet on the lines of Jingjiang and Wuwei and counties. In recent days, domestic and foreign news agencies have reported that the National Army bridgehead ports such as Yizheng near Jiangbei have been harassed by Communist troops. In fact, before and during the peace talks, the Communist troops would not attack the National Army bridgehead in Jiangbei. For the sake of their political strategy of "solving Beijing and Shanghai cannot solve China," although the situation of crossing the river has been formed, it must also wait for the peace talks to proceed and solve the situation afterwards. Therefore, the stationing of 300,000 troops, plus a total of about 460,000 local Communist troops, on the north bank can be said to have formed a "drinking horses on the Yangtze River" posture.</p>

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Regarding the distribution of the Communist Army's forces on the north bank of the Yangtze River and the recent developments, Zhang Taixiang, Director of the Political Warfare Department of the Songhu Garrison Command, told reporters yesterday: According to the information he obtained, Chen Yi's troops have about 130,000 troops east of the Grand Canal, about 60,000 troops west of the Grand Canal and east of the Jinpu Railway, and about 110,000 troops west of the Jinpu Railway. Recently, they have been actively preparing for a river-crossing offensive, but have not yet formed an attack posture. The dynamics are as follows: (1) The number of vehicles heading south on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway has increased significantly, and military transport is extremely busy. (2) Rush to repair the Dachang to Yizheng highway for military use. (3) Actively launch a military recruitment campaign near Liuhe. Those over 45 years old and under 60 years old are organized into the first team, those over 30 years old and under 45 years old are organized into the second team, and those under 30 years old are organized into the third team. It is planned that when crossing the river in the future, the first team will carry straw, the second team will each carry two hand grenades, and the third team will carry guns, first crossing by small wooden boats, and then followed by the main force of the regular army. (4) Chen Yi's troops are actively reorganizing and replenishing in Laian, Liuhe, Tianchang, Xuyi, and other places on the Jinpu Railway, and ordered the counties to urgently raise 72,000 dan of military rice and 36,000 dan of straw, and designated to transport them to the vicinity of Liuhe Leiguanji for storage. Now, the local villagers are delivering them in an endless stream. (5) Rush to build iron-clad warships, hand grenades, and set up intelligence networks along the river station, and step up the recruitment of soldiers and food, but euphemistically call it "joining the army" and "donating military food."</p>

(7) The repayment is reliable, and the recovered funds can be used for construction purposes. Those that meet the above principles can contact the committee to apply.

People close to the Portuguese Embassy also said that the State Department admitted that Portugal's reservation was acceptable. It is said that what Portugal is most concerned about is the Azores Islands, which have an important position in the defense of the Atlantic. The Azores are an important stopover point for air transportation between the two sides of the Atlantic. Portugal hopes that commercial aviation passing through the area will not be interfered with unless absolutely necessary. State Department officials also revealed that the preliminary negotiations for Portugal's participation in the Atlantic Pact have been extremely smooth, so the Portuguese Foreign Minister is expected to come to Washington in early April to join the foreign ministers of the seven countries of the Atlantic Pact to sign the treaty on April 4, making Portugal one of the initiators of the treaty. US officials also said that because the Portuguese people are averse to communism, if the Portuguese government approves the treaty, public opinion will not oppose it.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Washington 15th Dispatch] The Portuguese Embassy in the United States issued a communique, emphasizing that what the Portuguese government had to urge all signatory countries to pay attention to was that the exclusion of Spain, Portugal's neighbor, from the treaty would weaken the position of the Iberian Peninsula and lose a strategically important link.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington 16th Dispatch] US officials said that once the Madrid government expands and reorganizes, Spain will undoubtedly be invited to join the Atlantic Pact. They also said that the treaty does not stipulate that Spain or Ireland is prohibited from joining.</p>
<p>[US News Agency Washington 15th Dispatch] The representatives of the eight countries negotiating the draft North Atlantic Treaty concluded their scheduled meetings tonight. The full text of the treaty will be released at 4:00 PM on Friday (Greenwich Mean Time, midnight on the same day in Shanghai).</p>
<p>[Reuters London 15th Dispatch] British Foreign Secretary Bevin will arrive in the United States around March 31, and French Foreign Minister Schuman will fly to Washington on April 1 or 2 in order to sign the Atlantic Pact on April 4. The two will stay in the United States for about a week and will attend the opening ceremony of the United Nations General Assembly and discuss the general international situation with US authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Heated Congressional Debate on the Atlantic Pact: Italian Prime Minister Demands Vote of Confidence. Sforza Stresses That There Are No Secret Clauses <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press Rome 16th Dispatch] The Italian Parliament has concluded its debate on the Atlantic Pact in preparation for Prime Minister Gasperi's closing remarks on the afternoon of the 16th and a vote of confidence on Italy's negotiation to join the pact. Before requesting a vote of confidence from Parliament (which he is sure to obtain), Gasperi will likely speak for an hour.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Rome 16th Dispatch] The Italian Chamber of Deputies continued to debate the Atlantic Pact today. Left-wing Socialist Party member Basso vehemently opposed Italy's participation in the pact. He strongly stated that there was no need to fear Soviet aggression. The purpose of the Atlantic Pact is none other than to provide American merchants and soldiers with the means of war to achieve their goals. The debate will continue this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Reuters Rome 15th Dispatch] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza responded to questions from Communist Party members during the debate on the Atlantic Pact in the Chamber of Deputies today. He solemnly declared that the Atlantic Pact will never have secret clauses attached. He said that the Atlantic Pact was created because the United Nations was paralyzed due to the Soviet Union's repeated use of the veto power. Therefore, the Atlantic Pact was not created by the United States, but by the Soviet Union, which divided Europe. The Soviet Union already has agreements similar to spider webs with the Balkan countries, with Moscow as the center. Communists, like fascists, repeatedly state their lies in order to gain the trust of others. Those who oppose the Atlantic Pact are the same people who oppose the Marshall Plan and the European federal system. Their goal is to gradually establish a communist dictatorship in Western Europe. If we do not keep our doors open to facilitate Italy's joining the Atlantic Pact, we will be committing a great crime against Italy and peace. As for who wants war, it is certainly not the United Kingdom, which has spent half a century building socialism, it is certainly not France, which is extremely afraid of war, it is certainly not Belgium, which has been invaded by enemy cavalry twice, it is certainly not the Netherlands, which still has lingering fears, it is certainly not Luxembourg, which has only 600 gendarmes nationwide, and it is certainly not Italy, which is united against war. If the people inside the Communist Information Bureau had not threatened free and peaceful nations, the Atlantic Pact would not have been created at all. But I still believe that although the Soviet Union is willing to conquer other countries with the help of the Fifth Column, it is not willing to choose war.</p>

<p>Speculation on Whether There Are Other Backgrounds Is Divided</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 15th Dispatch] The recent changes in some ministers of the Soviet government have made US officials believe even more that the Kremlin is carrying out a Soviet-style "Hoover Plan." According to a recent announcement by Moscow Radio, three members of the Soviet Union's highest organ, the Politburo, have been relieved of their administrative duties, namely Molotov, who resigned as Foreign Minister, Mikoyan, who resigned as Minister of Foreign Trade, and Voznesensky, who resigned as Chairman of the State Planning Committee. This change is in line with the proposals of the government reorganization committee chaired by former US President Hoover. Hoover advocated expanding President Truman's power to decide foreign policy. US diplomatic authorities deeply believe that the Soviet Union's main purpose is also to strengthen the effectiveness of its highest political power, but opinions differ on whether there are other backgrounds for the reorganization.</p>

<p>[French News Agency Washington 15th Dispatch] Political figures here believe that the Soviet Union's decision to remove Voznesensky from the position of Chairman of the State Planning Commission is sufficient to confirm the recent reports received by Washington that the implementation of the Soviet economic plan has been delayed and that the Soviet Union's new economic difficulties are increasing. US experts all believe that the Soviet economy cannot enable it to simultaneously complete its expansion plans for heavy industry and the arms industry while raising the living standards of the people. Soviet resources have always been considered inexhaustible and should be abundant, but in reality they are severely insufficient, and the results of nationwide planned surveys and investigations have greatly disappointed the government.</p>

<p>[New Asia Agency Seoul 16th Dispatch] South Korean Prime Minister Lee Beom-seok met with reporters at 10:00 AM today and expressed his thoughts after inspecting Jeju Island and the situation of the rebellion in the area: "Although the activities of the Jeju Island rebels are increasing day by day and the number of occupied villages has reached more than 400, the government forces have made all preparations and will definitely be able to completely wipe out the rebels. We recently discovered a North Korean submarine communicating with the rebels on the mountain in Morse code on the sea one kilometer away from the coast of Hallasan. It is speculated that the youth trained by North Korea use this as a landing point and then go to Hallasan and Jirisan to join the South Korean rebels and resist the government." At the same time, Minister of the Interior Yoon Chi-young issued a public announcement stating: "Jeju is mostly controlled by rebels. The authorities must pay attention to the villages not occupied by rebels, quickly provide material relief, and solve the people's problems of clothing, food, and housing, so as not to force the poor to take risks and cause great chaos."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Seoul 15th Dispatch] Korean Prime Minister Lee Beom-seok said today that although the rebels in Jeju Island and South Jeolla Province have received Soviet support, they will still not be able to save themselves from being eliminated, and the rebels in South Korea will definitely be eliminated in the shortest possible time. Lee Beom-seok, who personally commanded the army in Jeju Island and South Jeolla Province, returned here and told reporters today that the Korean army had captured Soviet-made machine guns since attacking the red areas and captured the leaders of Soviet-trained guerrillas. Since February of this year, submarines and ships have frequently appeared on the island, which must be the Soviet Union supplying and replenishing the rebels with ammunition. Lee estimated that there were fewer than 300 armed rebels lurking on Jeju Island, and about 700 scattered in the mountains of South Jeolla Province.</p>

After the announcement of the treaty, the Communist Parties of France, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the Scandinavian countries will also follow suit with expressions of support. People here also believe that Molotov's resignation as Foreign Minister is so that he can devote his full energy to leading the East European United Front.</p>

Mr. Henderson was reporting on the plans of the British Air Force when requesting the House of Commons to approve the Air Force budget of 207 million pounds for the next year, which is an increase of 34 million pounds over this year. Mr. Henderson also revealed that the work of converting the British Air Force's daytime combat fleet and overseas assault team to jet combat aircraft will be completed by June of next year. The Meteor and Vampire jet combat aircraft currently used by the British Air Force are the best aircraft in the world's current active air force, but the latest aircraft being researched by the United Kingdom are even better. We are confident that the British Air Force's current leading position in the world for daytime combat aircraft will continue to be maintained in the future. A twin-engine jet bomber with a speed of 500 miles per hour and a jet night combat aircraft are also being ordered by the government.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 16th] The Burmese government is reported to have urgently appealed to London and New Delhi for assistance in averting a crisis where it may have to completely yield to the Karen rebels. Through its ambassadors in Britain and India, the Burmese government has frankly informed the British and Indian governments that without foreign aid, it will be unable to quell the domestic rebellion. The telegram admits that the entire country of Burma, except for the area surrounding Rangoon, is under rebel control, and that the rebels surrounding Rangoon have completed preparations for an attack, while their fifth column is actively engaged in propaganda within the city of Rangoon. The urgent telegram also frankly admits that after the rebels launch a general offensive against Rangoon, the government forces will be unable to defend for long, inevitably leading to a complete state of chaos. The Burmese government requests that Britain and India quickly provide military equipment to assist the Burmese government, and also issues a statement recognizing the Burmese government as the leader of the entire country, while simultaneously condemning the Karen for launching a rebellion, to provide moral support to the Burmese government. According to recent frontline reports, after the Karen rebels occupied Mandalay, they have moved their main force southward, crossed the Irrawaddy River, and are advancing on Rangoon.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The regular meeting of the Municipal Food Conference was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the auditorium of the Municipal Government. Representatives from relevant agencies such as the Food Department, the Public Opinion Research Association, and the Shanghai branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, as well as Mayor Wu Kuo-chen, Zhang Bide, the Chief of Protocol of the Municipal Government, and more than ten others attended. After the meeting, reporters inquired with the attendees about the resolutions of the meeting, but they all kept their mouths shut, only saying that it was an ordinary regular meeting and that there were no concrete decisions made. However, according to inquiries from relevant sources by our reporter, it is definitely known that the meeting did have important resolutions. The rice rationing for households in this city is entirely supplied by U.S. aid. According to the contract stipulations, the distribution of this U.S. rice will expire at the end of this month, and supplies will no longer be provided in the future. Mayor Wu, believing that at this time of extreme difficulty, if household rice rationing were to stop, it would inevitably cause extreme panic over food, and the consequences would be unimaginable, argued forcefully at the meeting, hoping that the U.S. side would continue to provide assistance. It is now learned that this request has been agreed to by the U.S. side, and the supply of U.S. aid rice will be extended to the end of June of this year. As for after June, it will depend on whether the U.S. Congress passes an extension. In any case, the household rice in this city will definitely continue as usual before the end of June. It is also learned that the U.S. rice is currently being shipped to Shanghai, and there should be no concerns about the food supply in this city in the short term.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the municipal government announced the cost of living index for mid-month to be 1339.36 times, rumors circulated that there was another black market index of 1642 times, causing dissatisfaction among labor unions. Yesterday, reporters inquired with Cao Peizi, the Bureau Chief of Social Affairs, who stated that the index statistics are absolutely scientific, and that representatives from both labor and management participate in the index meeting, making it impossible to arbitrarily alter the index. The rumors are therefore unreliable. In order to be more thorough, the Social Affairs Bureau will convene a cost of living index review meeting next week, inviting relevant parties to discuss technical improvements. Further inquiries were made as to whether the large advertisements published by Xiang Gui toothpaste, offering ten taels of gold as a prize for guessing the cost of living index to be announced by the Shanghai Municipal Government on May 16, would affect the confidentiality of compiling the cost of living index. Cao stated that publishing advertisements is a matter of freedom, and there is no legal basis to prohibit it, but he hopes that the media can automatically restrain it. Regarding the request from the barber and bathhouse industries to adjust the base number, Bureau Chief Cao instructed the two industries to draft base numbers for each level within three days, pending verification by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhou Xuexiang, the chairman of the General Labor Union, along with directors Ye Xianggao and Fang Rusheng, visited Bureau Chief Cao at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. Regarding the six measures for handling labor disputes promulgated by the Garrison Command a few days ago, which stipulated that the chairman of the labor union should bear joint liability if a labor dispute occurs, they believed that this responsibility was too great, and that in the future, the chairman of each labor union would be in constant fear. They requested that the Social Affairs Bureau provide protection. Bureau Chief Cao stated that regarding this matter, the Garrison Command's measures for handling labor disputes would have detailed explanations in addition to the clauses. He believed that joint liability referred to suspicion of inciting labor disputes, or standing by and watching when labor disputes occur. Assisting the government in preventing the occurrence of labor disputes would definitely not lead to implication. Zhou Xuexiang and others also raised the issue that finished products from steel refining enterprises were being sealed by military agencies, which would result in 8,000 workers losing their jobs. They requested that the authorities quickly find a solution. Cao stated that this matter had been discussed with the military agencies and that the products would be returned soon, so the resumption of operations would not be a problem.</p>

Zhang You, a consultant from the Ministry of Communications, and Lin Xuru, a director of the board of directors, supervised the handover. Guests from all walks of life, Yu Feipeng, Xu Enzeng, Wei Wenhan, Li Yunliang, Zhong Shandao, Shen Qi, and former Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company, Liu Hongsheng, as well as hundreds of employees, attended.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the handover ceremony, Chairman Xu first gave a speech. Then Zhang You, Lin Xuru, Yu Feipeng, Liu Hongsheng, and Wei Wenhan, the Chairman of the Shipping Industry Association, successively gave speeches. Then, Chairman Xu personally handed the seal of office to General Manager Hu. After receiving the seal, Hu delivered an impromptu speech, stating briefly that the policy for the future would be based on the following ten points: (1) A portion of the shares of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company belong to private ownership, but the majority of the shares are still state-owned. In the future, under the principle of thorough commercialization, we must still do our best to carry out the tasks assigned to us by the government. (2) Because a portion of the shares of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are privately owned, the interests of the private shareholders must be taken into account. (3) We will do our best to handle military and public transportation, and we cannot refuse. (4) In order to take into account the interests of the private shareholders, we must pay special attention to the profits of the business. (5) We will try to reduce expenses as much as possible and increase revenue. (6) Reducing expenses and increasing revenue requires a deep understanding of this and a determination and perseverance to implement it, both internally and externally, from top to bottom, in order to achieve results. (7) We will no longer add new people. We can only start from the coordination of people and things, and adjust the current staff as much as possible based on the needs of the work and the individual's talents. (8) I hope that all colleagues will do their best to promote their spirit of service. (9) I hope that all colleagues will be open and honest and cooperate fully. (10) My personal vision and hearing are limited, and my thinking is lacking. I urge knowledgeable people from all walks of life to give as much guidance as possible on various matters that the Bureau should promote and reform, as far as their vision and hearing can reach.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Sun Tiande, a native of Ningbo, opened the China Underwear Factory at 176 Jia Le Road in this city, producing Jianmei brand cotton undershirts and pants. In December of last year, taking advantage of the opportunity when the department stores in this city were running out of stock during the rush period, he promoted the factory's products to the various department stores and accepted large cash orders. However, on January 15 of this year, Sun Tiande suddenly fled without a trace. The various stores that had placed orders rushed to the factory to investigate upon hearing the news, only to find that Sun had moved away the important machinery and materials, and no one came forward to take responsibility, so they reported to the police station. After the court opened hearings twice to summon the defendant, the defendant ignored them, so an arrest warrant was issued. Based on a tip-off on the evening before last, Sun had returned to the factory, so the bailiffs arrested him and brought him to court. Yesterday afternoon, the court held a hearing. The plaintiffs, who were department stores, sent representatives from Tianyuanxiang, Hengfeng, and Qingnian No. 3 to the court. It is heard that this is the largest fraud case in Shanghai in recent months, with more than 30 victimized stores and a sum of nearly ten million Gold Yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Framing of Belgian Priest Case; Prosecution of Five Chinese and Foreign Criminals <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The five Chinese and foreign defendants, Ai Gai, Keli Ke, Yi Lieci, Jimi, and Wang Xianzhang, who were accused of framing Father George Gemayel and extorting tens of thousands of U.S. dollars, were arrested by the police station at the end of last month. The case was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office, and prosecutor Xu Dingkan spent half a month investigating. It has now concluded, and the defendants have been prosecuted on charges of intimidation and fraud.</p>
<p>The indictment stated briefly that the above defendants have no permanent occupation and are extravagant in their daily lives. They are dishonest in their conduct and make a living by defrauding others of their property due to financial difficulties. Keli Ke had previously committed embezzlement and forgery of securities and was sentenced to one year in prison. After serving his sentence, he was released, but he continued to act recklessly. On October 20 of last year, Keli used a bad check for US$800 from the First Trust Company of America, colluding with accomplices to obtain US$200 from real estate developer Thomson. On November 17, Yi Lieci, taking advantage of his son's school attendance, tricked Bai Laoqi, the principal of the school, out of 2,450 Gold Yuan under the pretense of selling white sugar. On January 8 of this year, Keli and Yi stayed in a room at the Paramount Hotel for more than ten days and owed a considerable amount of room fees. They used a 10,000 Gold Yuan bad check from the Bank of Communications to stall. On the 10th, Yi met a Korean named Liang Zaiyi in a cafe, and he seized the opportunity to trick him out of two strings of necklaces and a bottle of brandy. Later, there were many cases of defrauding room fees by mortgaging bad checks at the YMCA. Finally, on the evening of the 22nd of the same month, he conspired with several accomplices to break into the home of Belgian priest George Gemayel at No. 7, Lane 135, Huashan Road, and, under the pretext of private foreign exchange trading, impersonated personnel from the Songhu Garrison Command and the Municipal Police Bureau. They searched the house at will, and Keli seized the opportunity when Qiao was unprepared and stuffed a piece of counterfeit opium, made by Wang Xianzhang, into the bookcase, and publicly searched out the original object, falsely claiming that Qiao was privately hiding opium, in an attempt to defraud him of US$50,000. Qiao was forced by coercion and gifted US$1,500 and a US$30,000 draft before they left. Afterwards, Qiao reported to the police based on information, and the criminals were arrested one after another. They were transferred for investigation and prosecution on charges of intimidation and fraud.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office opened a second court hearing yesterday morning to investigate the major case of alleged embezzlement of 500,000 bags of wheat flour by Ye Xinmin, the director of the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food, and others.

Only Rong Yiren, the manager of Fuxing Flour Mill, the second defendant in the case, and Qian Shouchun, a related person, appeared in court to respond to the inquiry. The District Prosecutor's Office refused to publicly release information because the case was still under investigation. However, it is learned that Rong testified in court yesterday that he had delivered all of the superior wheat flour ground on behalf of Ye Xinmin, which can be proven by Qian Shouchun. However, Ye denied receiving the wheat flour during the interrogation at the previous court hearing.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the railroads, post office, and telecommunications automatically adjusted their rates three times a month in accordance with the formula, the Legislative Yuan strongly opposed and rejected it. Reporters visited the Shanghai Post Office, Telecommunications Bureau, and Jinghu Railway Bureau yesterday to inquire.

Currently, the three bureaus are still charging according to the new rates adjusted from the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>Recently, this city has still received ordinary letters with only 25 yuan of postage stamps. The post office has not processed them as underpaid letters. However, the person in charge of the post office stated that all postage for various letters and packages is still charged according to the new prices from the 11th, which means that ordinary letters weighing less than 20 grams should have 15 yuan of postage stamps. As for the newly discovered ordinary letters with only 25 yuan of postage stamps, it may be a temporary "omission."</p>

<h3 id="e96">City Government Publishes Advertisement Encouraging More Flour Consumption; 15,000 Tons of Flour in Storage, Prolonged Storage Will Likely Result in Losses <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that the city government authorities, upon the suggestion of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), have published advertisements in both Chinese and English newspapers to launch a "Eat More Flour Campaign." The background to this matter is understood as follows: In the past, American-aid flour was mostly used to supply North China. Since the Communist army swept through Peiping and Tianjin, the American-aid flour stored in Shanghai has reached as much as 15,000 tons, enough to supply the city's five million residents with five catties (approximately 2.5 kg) per person for ten days. Because flour is easily damaged if stored for a long time, the ECA is eager to distribute and sell it as soon as possible. Therefore, starting from February of this year, flour was distributed in addition to rice rations. However, southerners are accustomed to eating rice, and the number of people buying flour accounts for only about five percent. According to the number of North China residents living in this city, it accounts for about fifteen percent. In common sense, they should like to eat flour, but the result is the opposite. They believe that rice is easier to preserve than flour, the selling price is cheaper, and that it is more nutritious, so most also abandon flour for rice. The ECA has no other solution, so it consulted with the city government to use advertisements to urge citizens to voluntarily eat more rationed flour. However, according to sources, if this campaign is not effective, it may be implemented that only flour will be distributed without rice on certain ration days. It will be distributed in three phases each month, with five catties of flour per person per phase. There is precedent for this matter. That is, when the price limit was cancelled last October, there was a severe rice shortage in this city. At that time, all rations were flour, and the selling price was even above the market price.</p>
<h3 id="e97">New Scam Appears in Shanghai: Friends Riding in Cars Beware of Being Deceived; Intentionally Tearing Uniform to Demand Compensation - Security Authorities Should Pay Attention to Investigation <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] As endless crimes adorn this bustling international city, a new scam has recently appeared in Shanghai, unique and specifically targeting the car-owning class. A week ago, an American lady named Mrs. Carter, along with two friends, came out from the Petain Apartments and drove a car. Not long after the car drove, they suddenly noticed a person wearing an empty car uniform intentionally bumped the back of her car and immediately ordered her to stop. The person then ran up, accompanied by two other people in the same uniform. One of them spoke English and warned Mrs. Carter, "You tore my friend's clothes, you must immediately compensate for the loss of 70,000 yuan." Mrs. Carter was shocked at the time. Looking back, there was indeed a big hole in the sleeve of the man's right arm. Was this caused by Mrs. Carter's car? - It was raining at that time, of course the man was wet all over, but on closer inspection, the cloth he was holding that had been torn was completely dry, so undoubtedly this was a pre-arranged scam. So Mrs. Carter replied at the time: "I can pay you money, but this money must be handed directly to the Garrison Headquarters. Please show me your name and affiliated organization." After Mrs. Carter finished speaking, she immediately called to notify the Garrison Department. At this moment, the three people disappeared at the same time.</p>
<p>The above incident occurred at 3:15 pm on the 10th of this month. Afterwards, Mrs. Carter wrote a letter to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, describing the illegal soldier in detail - five feet four inches tall, broad-shouldered, wearing brown sunglasses, wearing an air force hat, wearing a green khaki uniform, with wool lining, and a handgun hidden in the outer garment. The torn hole used for blackmail was on the left upper arm about four inches from the elbow.</p>
<p>It was only four days after Mrs. Carter's letter was published in the *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* that the same incident appeared again. - At 9:45 last night, a reader of this newspaper drove through the Huajin Lane area of Sanma Road and found three soldiers coming towards them, refusing to give way in a grand manner. In this way, the speed of the car had to slow down. As the car approached, the three people slightly dodged to both sides of the road, leaving only enough space for the width of a car. When the driver carefully and cautiously passed through as if taking a driving test, one of them bumped the car door with his right arm and ordered him to stop, at which time the three of them swarmed up, saying that the car had torn his clothes, and showed his watch, saying that the watch was also broken, forcing him to pay compensation. But at first glance, the watch was still running and was not damaged. It was indeed a piece torn from the clothes on the right arm, but this broken part was higher than the car door and could not be touched by any part of the car, so it was not difficult to determine that this was the same scam. After this reader informed the newspaper of the incident, the reporter believed that it was necessary to record it. On the one hand, to report the endless emergence of new scams in this city, hoping that citizens will be vigilant. On the other hand, it is also hoped that the security authorities will pay attention to this. If they do not find a way to ban it, even the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk will be deprived.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Otto Preminger, the director and producer of the American 20th Century Fox film "Amber," accompanied by screenwriter Pillip Dunne, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Hong Kong on a Pan American Airways flight, arriving at Longhua at 6:50 pm and staying at the Cathay Hotel. Also accompanying them were the Chinese playwright Yao Ke and his wife. Preminger recently plans to shoot a new film set in Hong Kong, so he specially took his screenwriter to Hong Kong for inspection. They stayed in Hong Kong for about two weeks and visited the Yonghua Film Company and met with several Chinese movie stars. It is reported that Tyrone Power will be the protagonist in his new film, and a Chinese actress will be cast as a supporting role. It is said that he is very interested in Chen Yunshang. (According to reports, Chen is now living in seclusion in Hong Kong with her husband, Dr. Tang, and has given birth to a daughter.) However, Preminger did not confirm this yesterday. He said that the content and title of the new film have not yet been decided. They are currently only here to observe whether Hong Kong can be used as a background. He criticized the Hong Kong film industry, saying: Although the scale is small, the equipment is quite modern. It is reported that he will sign a contract with Yonghua to cooperate in the future filming of the new film. They will stay in Shanghai for two days and then return to the United States via Tokyo. Preminger's works that have been shown in this city include "Fallen Angel," "Laura," "Centennial Summer," and "Forever Amber." The new work "Centennial Summer" will soon be released in the Cathay and Carlton theaters. Pillip Dunne is a famous screenwriter, and the screenplay for "How Green Was My Valley," which won an Academy Award, is Dunne's representative work.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Anti-Survival Committee organized by Jiaotong University students will hold a complaint meeting at the school tonight.</p>
<p>The Fudan University Faculty, Staff, Employee, Police, and Student Anti-Survival Committee was officially established on the afternoon of the 15th. Representatives from lecturers, teaching assistants, staff, workers, and students all participated. The Professors' Association adopted a reserved attitude and did not send representatives to attend. Currently, other units are trying to win the participation of professors. On the evening of the 15th, the school's students held an anti-survival complaint meeting at Deng Hui Hall. More than 1,000 teachers, students, employees, police, and classmates attended. It was decided to contact other schools in Shanghai to organize the Shanghai National College Student Friendship Association, and issue a letter to the public, requesting the government to: (1) All students receive public funding. (2) The salaries of faculty, staff, and police and the public funding for students are calculated based on the base salary multiplied by the price index. (3) Increase the school's regular expenses. Yesterday morning, more than 800 students from the school went to Tongji, Shanghai Business and other schools to carry out publicity and liaison work. After hearing the news, the Garrison Command sent police cars to discourage them, and no accidents occurred.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Presidents of National Colleges and Universities Agreed on the Amount of Overdraft Funding <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The presidents of the national colleges and universities in this city met at noon yesterday to discuss the calculation method for overdrafting school funds from national banks. It was decided that the amount of the overdraft would be the total amount of living allowances and student meal expenses. However, because the central government has not yet determined the multiple standard for living allowances, etc., the overdraft from national banks will be temporarily calculated based on the current 225 times. In addition, it was also decided to telegraph the Ministry of Education in Guangzhou, requesting that the funds to be reissued this month and the amount to be prepaid next month be notified to the National Treasury Department as soon as possible for preparation.</p>
<p>According to Fudan University President Zhang Xiang said to reporters: The measures for adjusting the treatment of public officials announced by the Executive Yuan stipulate that it should be calculated based on the cost of living index of civil servants. This index varies from region to region and is no different from the cost of living index of local workers. In order to compile this civil servant index, the government will need to collect data from various regions. After the index is announced, it will then notify the National Treasury Department to issue payment vouchers. After going through various procedures, it is estimated that the earliest time to receive the reissued amount will be on the 10th of next month, and the devaluation loss will be very large. Therefore, he believes that this method of calculating salaries based on the civil servant index has many technical difficulties in implementation. He hopes that the government can pay attention to it so as not to cause devaluation losses to various public officials.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai National College and University Professors' Association recently held a meeting and decided that the 500 times salary that has been issued is only recognized as the amount reissued for February, and requested that the presidents of each school rush to issue the March salary, calculated by multiplying the original salary by the price index without discount. At noon yesterday, the presidents of the national colleges and universities met and discussed this. The presidents had already forwarded the professors' request to calculate salaries based on the price index, along with the requests of staff to strive for further study expenses and self-funded students to strive for public funding, to the Ministry of Education. The presidents believe that this is a whole treatment issue. However, taking March as an example, there is a huge gap between the professors' requirements and the multiple stipulated by the government. It seems that this issue still needs to be resolved after the establishment of the new cabinet. The presidents of each school all hope to seek a solution as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Detective Section of the Police Station recently received a report that five robbers, Qu Genlin, Chen Gesheng, Gan Lixi, Wang Yecai, and Yang Yugao, planned to go to the residence of Gao Linfa, general manager of Likang Box Factory at No. 5, Lane 174, Kangding Road, at 7 pm on the 13th of this month. They also learned that the bandits first opened room 312 at the New World Hotel on Nanjing West Road as a place to gather, discuss, and store guns. The section chief Gan personally planned the case-breaking steps. Two hours in advance, he selected more than ten officers, including Qian Daxin, Wang Wenxiang, Zhang Jingyu, Ma Bingzhang, and members of the Flying Fortress Team, to disguise themselves as various people near the New World Hotel to secretly wait and watch the bandits' movements. At about 5 pm, Chen and Wang gathered in the room, carrying a fast-slow machine gun and three handguns, hidden on the top of the cupboard. At this time, Qu, Gan, and Yang went to the vicinity of the victim's residence to survey the robbery site. They returned at 6 pm. Just as they were about to set off together, section chief Gan and others, believing that the time was ripe, rushed into the room under the pretext of checking the room, captured all the bandits, seized the guns, and escorted them back to the headquarters for interrogation.

<h3 id="e108">Peiping Style (5) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Xue</p>
<p>Report on a City Before and After "Partial Peace"</p>
<p>(5) Social Phenomena After Peace</p>
<p>Slogans such as "Confiscate Bureaucratic Capital," "Protect National Industry and Commerce," and "Develop Production, Prosper the Economy, Take into Account Both Public and Private Interests, Benefit Both Labor and Capital" appeared in Peiping after liberation. This was undoubtedly a reassurance for ordinary citizens and industrialists, reducing their many anxieties. In fact, after the Chinese Communists entered the city, there were too many state-owned enterprises and materials. Concentrating all their efforts on receiving them was still not easy. They had no time to care about private enterprises and general industry and commerce. What kind of policies will the Chinese Communists adopt for private enterprises and general industry and commerce after state-owned enterprises and bureaucratic capital are taken over in the future? In many places, the division between bureaucratic capital and private enterprises is ambiguous and very flexible! How to accurately divide them? These are all problems.</p>
<p>However, judging from the current situation, since the Communist army entered the city, the atmosphere among ordinary citizens has gradually changed. Everyone's clothes and attire must be worn out to look poor. In the past, modern girls who wore fur coats and plush coats also changed to ordinary woolen coats to avoid unnecessary accidents and disputes. In the development of general industry and commerce, only daily necessities such as oil, salt, flour, miscellaneous grains...etc., because they are indispensable, there is still business to be done. Other businesses such as silk and satin shops, woolen shops, Western clothing shops, department stores...etc., have become so deserted that there is almost no business! The shops in Wangfujing Street are deserted and abnormally depressed. Few people go to patronize them. Other industrial companies are also in a state of stagnation due to the interruption of traffic and the inability to import many raw materials. Therefore, although the Chinese Communists chanted "Protect National Industry and Commerce," the current decline of industry and commerce casts a terrible shadow in the minds of general industrialists and businessmen. At the same time, due to changes in social lifestyles, the Chinese Communists' future industrial and commercial policies will be re-examined and formulated.</p>
<p>Regarding the price of goods in Peiping, it once fell sharply when partial peace was first announced, but it immediately rebounded and returned to its original state in less than a day. During the vacuum period when the old was gone and the new had not yet entered the city, prices showed even more dramatic increases. The increase in silver dollars was more than ten times higher than when it fell. When the Communist army entered the city, although it was just the beginning of the Lunar New Year and the market had not yet opened. However, when it came to the seventh day of the first month, which was supposed to be the opening day, the general stores took the excuse of not yet announcing the exchange rate between the people's currency and the gold yuan and remained closed and did not operate. The gold and US dollar markets have not yet opened. Later, the exchange rate between the gold yuan and the people's currency was determined to be ten to one, and prices were once again impacted and rose sharply. When I left Peiping (around February 20), the price of silver dollars rose again from 240 people's currency per dollar to 300 people's currency per dollar (that is, 3,000 gold yuan). Except for miscellaneous grains, coal and other local products, which increased less, other items such as gasoline, newspapers, cigarettes, hardware, Western medicine, gold notes, and silver dollars all increased very sharply! The price of goods in Peiping after peace was also unstable.</p>
<p>The time for the use of the gold yuan was announced as two months, exchanged for the people's currency at a rate of ten to one. Workers, students, and urban poor were given preferential treatment, and could exchange for the people's currency at a rate of three to one with a residence permit or official letter, limited to fifteen days. The poor quality of the paper used to print the people's currency was somewhat like the ghost money we burned to the dead. If you put it in your pocket for a day or two, it would become blurry or torn. The banknotes of the Jinan Bank and the Beihai Bank were even worse. Now that the Peiping branch of the Central Printing Factory has been taken over, it may be possible to print a batch of better banknotes. In this action of exchanging gold yuan, although the Chinese Communists were able to absorb the gold yuan early and purchase goods from the Kuomintang area to maintain the value of the gold yuan, it also fully demonstrated the Chinese Communist cadres' efficiency and service spirit! The exchange began on February 6th. Several hundred exchange points were set up in the east, west, north, and south main streets of the city. Although the people exchanging were so crowded, the exchange was completed ahead of schedule on February 15th. This is very different from the efficiency and service spirit of the past issuance of the gold yuan, which was exchanged by various banks. The country's misgovernment by bureaucratic style is once again proven here.</p>
<p>Peiping is a cultural city. There are no less than hundreds of universities and schools of all sizes. The number of students should be in the hundreds of thousands. The situation of the education sector and schools in Peiping after peace is certainly a matter of concern to everyone. As far as I know, the first university to be taken over was Tsinghua University. The School Affairs Committee organized by representatives of professors was responsible for maintaining it. No president was appointed. As for how to reform the courses in various departments, it is still under research and discussion. The start of classes is indefinite. The situation in other national universities is also roughly the same. Most have organized school affairs committees to be responsible for receiving and maintaining them. Some private universities have also cancelled the president system and followed suit. It is the same across the board that the Three People's Principles have stopped being taught, the Kuomintang and Sanqing Tuan students have stopped their activities, and the establishment of the Dean of Students has been abolished. Some students from various schools participated in the Military Control Commission's takeover work. Most of them returned to their hometowns because of the isolation of postal and telecommunications and the interruption of economic sources. In the past, public-funded students were still complaining every day even with government subsidies and white flour. Now the Chinese Communists only issue a small amount of corn flour or millet per person to maintain life, and they no longer dare to complain!</p>
<p>The teachers and staff of primary schools have held several meetings, collective learning and discussions, and members of the Chinese Communist Party have been sent to participate in guidance and explanation. The main issues are textbooks, tuition fees, and course schedules. Fortunately, the Chinese Communists already had a set of primary school textbooks in the liberated areas in the past, which could be used as long as they were reprinted. Other issues such as tuition fees and course schedules can be easily decided immediately to seek liberation. The problems in middle schools are more complicated. The minds of teachers also need to be changed. With collective learning, the start of classes is still far away, or classes may be started as usual first, and then gradually improved later. In short, when I left Peiping (February 20), it was a fact that none of the schools, large, medium, or small, had started classes.</p>
<p>After the Zhengzhong Book Company and the Independent Publishing House were taken over by the Chinese Communists, they were renamed Xinhua Bookstore. Its store front was located at the southern end of Wangfujing Street. A reading room was also set up next to it for people to enter and browse at will. On the opening day, there were many buyers! The Xinhua Bookstore is the Chinese Communist Party's spiritual granary. After Peiping was partially pacified, everyone needed to learn Mao Zedong Thought, so they had to seek it from this granary. The Xinhua Bookstore was often crowded with readers and buyers. Everyone hoped to find some new knowledge here. A hardcover collection of Mao Zedong's essays costs more than 700 people's currency, which is more than 7,000 gold yuan. The price is too expensive, making it impossible for many people with not-so-rich economies to buy it, so they have to look away. This business that speculates in making money and also assumes propaganda tasks is also very worthwhile.</p>
<p>Peiping was originally a consuming city. Because the cost of living was not too expensive, not a few young people who had dropped out of school and were unemployed stayed in Peiping! Especially after the Northeast and Northwest were successively abandoned, the area gradually shrunk to only Peiping. Many people who fled to Peiping from various places also came! This time, after the partial peace was realized, many institutions were abolished, so there were also many unemployed. The North China People's Revolutionary University, which trains general cadres, and the Military and Political University, which trains military cadres, of the Chinese Communists just happened to announce their recruitment in Peiping. They need to recruit more than 10,000 people, which is of course a major impulse for these wandering and depressed unemployed and out-of-school youth. Everyone flocked to the registration offices of Peking University and Normal University to register. Fortunately, as long as you have a higher elementary school education or above, you can apply to the university. Who doesn't want to try it? They are tested as they come, and the criteria for admission will not be too strict. What the Chinese Communists need today are cadres. After this replenishment, it should be a major gain!</p>
<h3 id="e109">Storing Grain Among the People: Xinjiang Expands Spring Plowing Movement <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>[Dihua, 11th (Airmail)] When mentioning the grain issue in Xinjiang, one cannot help but think of Yili, known as the "Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall." Yili has long been known as the granary of northern Xinjiang and the land of rice and wheat. It possesses natural advantages with abundant rainfall, fertile soil, and a warm climate, making its grain production the highest in the province. The annual output, considering only rice and wheat, reaches four to five million shi (a unit of dry measure). If corn, sorghum, highland barley, and other coarse grains are included, the figure exceeds six to seven million shi.</p>
<p>Unable to Eat Yili Rice</p>
<p>In the past, military, public, and civilian grain for northern Xinjiang relied entirely on Yili. Even the trains running to Siberia loaded some rice and white flour exported from Yili.</p>
<p>However, this fertile land unfortunately experienced the Yili Incident in the autumn of 1945. Since then, Yili has been separated from the control and management of the Xinjiang government, and it has no longer been possible to eat rice and white flour from Yili.</p>
<p>Following the Yili Incident, the Ashan and Tacheng regions also became special, greatly affecting the grain supply in northern Xinjiang. Northern Xinjiang is divided into five regions; after the Yili Incident, only the Dihua and Hami regions remained. Now, the entire grain supply of northern Xinjiang relies solely on these two regions. However, the grain production of these two regions is less than one-third of the total. The four counties under the jurisdiction of the Hami region—Hami, Zhenxi, Yiwu, and Qijiaojing—are very barren, with an annual grain output of no more than 150,000 shi. The eleven counties under the jurisdiction of the Dihua region—Dihua, Fukang, Bansu, Qitai, Muli River, Changji, Jinghua, Suilai, Turpan, Shanshan, and Toksun—produce no more than 1.5 million shi even in a good harvest (including other coarse grains). This amount is insufficient to supply the needs of northern Xinjiang, where the province's population is concentrated.</p>
<p>Whenever there is a grain shortage panic, people cannot forget this fertile land—Yili.</p>
<p>Production is Severely Unbalanced</p>
<p>Besides the Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan regions, the province currently has seven other regions: five in southern Xinjiang and two in northern Xinjiang. The total arable land is approximately 14,580,000 mu (a unit of area), which can produce 7 million shi of wheat, over 700,000 shi of rice, over 400,000 shi of highland barley, over 700,000 shi of corn, over 400,000 shi of lentils, over 400,000 shi of red beans, over 400,000 shi of mung beans, over 700,000 shi of sorghum, and over 500,000 shi of millet. However, this figure is an estimate for a year of good harvest; last year's harvest was only half of this amount.</p>
<p>Before the Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan regions became special, the grain production of southern and northern Xinjiang was balanced. Currently, however, southern Xinjiang accounts for over 70% of the production, while northern Xinjiang accounts for only 30%.</p>
<p>This imbalance in grain supply and demand has caused the Xinjiang authorities considerable headaches. Each year, the provincial treasury allocates large sums of money to transport grain from southern Xinjiang to meet the needs of northern Xinjiang, and provides subsidies to encourage sugar merchants to transport grain from southern Xinjiang to sell in northern Xinjiang. However, this approach is like trying to quench a thirst with water from afar.</p>
<p>Transportation Costs Exceed Grain Prices</p>
<p>Xinjiang is a vast region, and the distance between southern and northern Xinjiang is not short, often reaching hundreds or even thousands of kilometers. Moreover, transportation is inconvenient, and transportation tools are scarce. Motor vehicle transportation can only reach Yanqi, Luntai, Kashi, and Aksu, while transportation to other counties relies entirely on animal-powered postal transport. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, freight costs are high, which not only slows down the transportation rate but also increases the provincial government's expenses significantly. Transporting one shi of grain from southern Xinjiang to northern Xinjiang costs dozens of times more than the price of the grain itself. However, in order to supplement the grain shortage in northern Xinjiang, the provincial government has no choice but to grit its teeth and do so.</p>
<p>Agriculture is Difficult to Develop</p>
<p>Regarding the state of agriculture in Xinjiang, it is a continental region with a cold and dry climate and little rainfall. The soil is mostly alkaline and sandy, so its harvest yields are not as good as those in the interior. Even in a good harvest year, the average yield is only 50% (i.e., harvesting five dou (a unit of dry measure) for every dou sown). Normally, a yield of 20-30% is considered good. As for farming techniques, they are also rudimentary. These natural geographical limitations and poor techniques hinder the development of agriculture in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Is There Enough Food?</p>
<p>So, is there enough food in Xinjiang? The best way to answer this question is to examine the living standards of rural farmers. In the countryside, middle-class families are fortunate if they can eat bread. Most people fill their stomachs with millet, corn, and sorghum. Not to say that ten households out of ten are empty, but very few can afford to eat grain until April or May. Taking the recent procurement of public grain as an example, the depletion of grain is even more obvious. Even those allocated one or two shi have no grain to turn in. According to reports from various county governments, the people's annual harvest, after paying land taxes and procuring grain, leaves them with nothing to eat for themselves.</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation in Dihua, on the surface, it can barely be maintained. The government uses large amounts of cash to purchase grain from farmers, who, in order to obey the government, sell all they have. In fact, some farmers even have problems with seeds. Now that spring plowing is imminent, various counties are requesting loans from the provincial government to provide seeds to farmers. If the heavens were to make things difficult for the people of Xinjiang and bring a drought, windstorm, or locust plague, then the more than four million people would inevitably face starvation.</p>
<p>Ways to Develop Grain Sources</p>
<p>If there is not enough food in Xinjiang, what should be done? We believe that: (1) the grain from Yili should be allowed to flow out quickly; (2) large-scale reclamation should be carried out on both banks of the Tarim River, where there are endless fertile green lands that have not been cultivated. If the government could allocate large sums of money to open up and relocate immigrants to cultivate the land, we believe that the harvest would be significant; (3) water conservancy should be developed, as most crops in Xinjiang fail due to lack of water; (4) transportation should be developed to ensure balanced supply; (5) agricultural loans should be expanded to increase production; and (6) farming techniques should be improved, and pest and disease control should be implemented.</p>
<p>The Xinjiang Provincial Government is now making its best efforts in these areas. As far as we know, many tons of white flour from Yili are about to be transported to Dihua. The provincial bank has already allocated a large amount of spring plowing loans. Recently, Chairman Bao Erhan personally ordered the Construction Department and other relevant agencies to promote the expansion of spring plowing. The Uyghur-language Xinjiang Daily is responding to this need by preparing to publish several special supplements. Liu Mengchun, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, once emphatically pointed out the firm stance and methods of "storing grain among the people" at a meeting of the Financial and Economic Group. We can believe that the Xinjiang Provincial Government is moving towards self-reliance, and that food can be made self-sufficient.</p>

<p>Nanjing [Our Correspondent] Qian Jilin, accountant of the National Frontier Cultural and Educational Museum, went to Taiwan on official business. Previous reports that he had absconded with public funds and property are inaccurate.</p>
<p>Yixing [Our Correspondent] Yesterday morning at around 6:00 AM, a company of regular troops from the Tangdu area of Dingshu District in the county marched to Shushan Town, surrounded the town hall, cut off traffic, confiscated all the regular constabulary, including one machine gun and twenty rifles, and took away five squad leaders and two local residents in the direction of Changxing. Their whereabouts are unknown. The county government has reported the incident and telegraphed the Changxing County government for assistance in apprehending them.</p>
<p>Changshu [Our Correspondent] Following incidents of attacks and gun confiscations against local self-defense forces and security regiments in rural areas, the Provincial Security Commander has telegraphed the county government, pointing out the lack of strict precautions when the regular constabulary is attacked by thugs. He urged the authorities to order their subordinates to strengthen self-defense organizations, tighten security, and search for scattered bandits to maintain public order.</p>
<p>Jiangyin [Our Correspondent] The Cheng County Grain Office has over-allocated more than 10,000 shi of military grain based on the collected land tax figures. Although Deputy Director Xu went to the province to request a suspension of the allocation, it was not approved due to the urgency of military supplies. After repeated pleas, a grain purchasing plan was formulated. Xu returned to Cheng on the 12th and convened a meeting of heads of various agencies to decide that the province would order the purchase of 3,000 large bags of unmilled military grain (totaling 4,000 shi). The province would allocate funds to purchase grain with cash through the Grain Industry Association from Wuxi and Jiangyin counties, with the Grain Supervision Committee issuing certificates. The price would be based on the market price on the day of purchase. The provincial office has allocated 10 million yuan and will purchase at the current market price.</p>

<h3 id="e116">National Bank Allots Original Gold to Silver Shops: Yesterday Adopts Quoted Pricing and Allocation System; No Applications in the Morning, Applications Submitted but Not Allocated in the Afternoon <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Central Bank's method of allocating original gold to silver shops has been changed to a quoted pricing and allocation system, as decided by the Financial Stabilization Committee. It is stipulated that from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM, each silver shop will submit the quantity of gold it wishes to be allocated to the National Bank. After 11:00 AM, a three-person team will determine the allocation price, notify each applicant, and then the applicant will remit payment to collect the allocated gold.</p>
<p>After the National Bank notified the silver shops of the change to a quoted pricing and allocation system at 10:00 AM yesterday, applications were accepted until nearly 11:00 AM. However, due to the new method only just being implemented, many silver shops adopted a wait-and-see approach, and consequently, no one applied. In the afternoon, the silver shops submitted quoted prices for allocation from 2:00 PM until the 3:30 PM deadline. The quoted prices were 375,000 yuan, which the National Bank deemed that there was no need to allocate, and as a result, no gold was allocated.</p>
<p>After the method of allocating gold was changed, Lin Chongyong, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, stated that the method of allocating gold had long been determined to be of two types. The one implemented in the past was the first type, and the one implemented yesterday was the second type. In order to take the initiative, the Central Bank decided to implement these two methods alternately, so that the silver shops would be unable to predict the Stabilization Committee's allocation price, and there was no other intention, he said.</p>
<p>President of the Central Bank, Liu Gongyun, convened two meetings at the Bank of China starting at 9:00 AM yesterday. The first was the regular meeting of the Gold and Silver Stabilization Committee, attended by Xi Demao, Li Daonan, Lin Chongyong, Shao Huihua, Chen Changtong, and others, to discuss improving the technical aspects of gold allocation. The second was a review meeting, which was also attended by Bi Delin, a special representative of the Ministry of Finance, and a representative of the Supervisory Envoy's Office. Liu reported on past allocation situations, followed by a review meeting. After the meeting, which ended at 11:15 AM, all attendees remained silent. It is said that many concrete decisions were made.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] The Chinese stock market opened high and closed low yesterday, rising steadily in the middle, but then turned around near noon. The money market was loose due to the influence of the overnight clearing by banks, and the day rate was below 70 yuan with ample supply. The sentiment was good in the morning due to the loose money supply. Various factions were still buying actively, and the market was holding steady. Later, rumors spread within the circle, and sentiment on the trading floor became uneasy. The bulls were particularly vulnerable, and the market weakened for a time. Yong Yarn opened high at 6.6 yuan under the influence of buying from all sides. Covering overnight short positions pushed it up to 6.71 yuan. Buying from the financial and securities factions pushed it up further to 6.75 yuan. Large investors sold at high prices, and the market softened slightly, falling to 6.61 yuan and 6.58 yuan, stabilizing at around 6.6 yuan in the middle. Later, rumors spread outside the market, and gold weakened for a time. Sentiment was panicked, and buying was dismal, falling to 6.49 yuan. Finally, the rumors subsided, and the gold market recovered, stabilizing sentiment, and rising again to 6.58 yuan. Near the close, it was reported that the physical market was unanimously weak, and sellers were selling in droves. The market fell again, closing at 6.41 yuan.

At that time, deferred delivery trading will also be opened simultaneously. The exchange is ready and can be implemented as soon as the Ministry of Finance issues the order, he said.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks Rise Slightly, Gold Bonds Perform Well</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The foreign stock market was mediocre yesterday. Although the money supply was loose, buying was weak. Sentiment was stable at the opening, and buying was still strong on the trading floor. Later, it was reported that the Hong Kong exchange rate had narrowed again, and the market became slightly better. Following reports of weak stock prices in Hong Kong, it quickly became sluggish again. Bids softened. Jardine opened at 13,000 yuan, closing at 12,600 yuan, 12,800 yuan at noon. Asia opened at 12,500 yuan, 12,700 yuan. British American Tobacco was bid at 15,500 yuan, and Wheelock Marden was bid at 40,000 yuan, offered at 43,000 yuan, but the results were flat.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] Gold prices rose in both the morning and afternoon sessions yesterday. Initially, due to the loose money supply and low shadow rates, many retail investors were unwilling to lend, so the psychology of holding goods became strong again, and the bulls were active on the trading floor, with the market rising steadily. The opening in the morning was quite good under the influence of buying, opening initially at 382, 387. New buying increased after the opening, covering short positions, and the market first traded at 385, 387, then at 390, 393, rising to as high as 396. After the high, sentiment turned weak, and the bulls became cautious, with many taking profits, falling back to 385, 382 for a time. At noon, the Central Bank had not taken any action, and sentiment was stable, closing at 385, 388.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the money supply loosened further, and buying was still strong on the trading floor, with the market rising in a straight line. The opening was initially at 405, 410, and it traded firmly after the opening, rising gradually, reaching 415, 418 after 3:00 PM, and finally closing at 417, 420.</p>

<h3 id="e121">A Stroll Through the Market: The Onlooker's Perspective <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>A big rise is not considered a rise, one has a radiant face, even if no gold can be allocated, one can still not show one's hand.</p>
<p>Yesterday, general prices rose by another 20% or so across the board. Calculating interest rates, it is also not considered a rise, so it is not good to say that the Central Bank has lost control of the market. The Central Bank's high-interest policy is meant to offset the extent of this rampant rise. The face looks much better, and the magic of the high-interest policy is to blame the responsibility for the rampant rise on the high interest.</p>
<p>Shifting responsibility is a traditional practice in Chinese officialdom, previously only seen in general administration, and its application to economics is a recent phenomenon.</p>
<p>In recent years, hyperinflation has led to soaring prices. In the past, the authorities often said, "It is the result of speculation and hoarding," lightly shifting the responsibility to merchants and civilians.</p>
<p>In the past, this method of shifting responsibility was not clever because one was at a loss when the market soared, which was a bit embarrassing.</p>
<p>Now, with high interest, the responsibility for the rampant rise can be shifted to interest rates. Moreover, a 20% increase in one day was considered a rampant rise in the past; now it is considered not to have risen. In the past, a doubling in three or five days was rare and considered extremely serious. Now, because the daily rate of 5 jiao or more is the base, even if it doubles in a day, it is only considered to be 80%. The advantage of high interest lies in treating a big rise as a small rise.</p>
<p>The high-interest policy can be said to be an incredibly clever way to shift responsibility. However, the financial authorities, being good at using their brains, came up with another new trick yesterday, changing the method of allocating gold to quoted pricing and allocation.</p>
<p>Quoted pricing and allocation is also a good way to shift responsibility. Let me tell you its magic:</p>
<p>(1) In the past, the Central Bank bore the responsibility of raising gold prices when it increased the allocated gold price. Now, the applicant submits the price they are willing to pay, and after the Central Bank approves it, the allocation is made. Therefore, the applicant raises the price they are willing to pay, and the Central Bank can allocate it at the high price, thereby shifting the responsibility for the price increase to the merchants.</p>
<p>(2) If the applicant lowers the price they are willing to pay, then the Central Bank has the right not to allocate. Therefore, this method is not disadvantageous.</p>
<p>(3) In the past, when the Central Bank posted prices for allocation, it had the responsibility to fully allocate according to the posted prices. What a dangerous responsibility! Now, by changing to quoted pricing and allocation, the Central Bank can avoid showing its hand that it has no gold to allocate under the guise of not approving the quoted price, even when there is no gold to allocate.</p>
<p>From this, it can be known that the magic of this "quoted pricing and allocation" is: (1) it has the reality of allocating gold at a high price, but without the responsibility of allocating at a high price; (2) it can avoid showing its hand when there is no gold to allocate.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of silver dollar deposits, a responsible person from the Ministry of Finance recently stated that the Ministry of Finance is considering it, and there are no problems in principle. However, the Ministry of Finance does not intend to have any rigid regulations. If various banks and firms have some plans, they can be approved, but the level of interest and the use of deposits cannot exceed the scope of laws and regulations, and those that conflict with the Banking Law will be subject to suppression.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the money supply loosened slightly, and all commodities rose. Moreover, after the index was released, general salary earners, in order to avoid the devaluation of cash, were all vying to exchange for silver dollars, and the value of big-head silver dollars increased a hundredfold. In the morning, the quoted price for big-head silver dollars was only 53 (bid), 55 (offer), but by the evening, someone was still exchanging them at 6,200. It is said that the speed of this rise has set a record for the rise in silver dollars.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to a responsible person from a certain bureau of the National Bank yesterday, the relevant authorities hope to formally establish the gold and silver market in the city next Monday to commence trading. The market will trade in gold, silver, and silver dollars. Currently, they are awaiting the financial authorities' approval of the gold spot trading methods drafted by the Gold Industry Association to ensure compliance during trading.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the city's Gold Industry Association began clearing accumulated items from the association's premises yesterday. Negotiations for installing telephone lines are ongoing. The number of members who have registered to resume business has reached twenty, while the number of those requesting application forms has reached one hundred. Based on the association's current preparations, the prospect of resuming business next Monday remains uncertain.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Bank Outflows Cause Easy Money <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the money market went from easy to excessive. The opening day's interbank lending rate was still in the range of eighty to ninety yuan. Later, with stable gold and banknote prices and increased lending, frequent remittances from other cities and national treasury disbursements resulted in significant outflows of funds. By the afternoon, the market was flooded with cash, and the interbank lending rate fell sharply from seventy-five yuan to sixty-five yuan, eventually settling around sixty yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the national banks and bureaus had a substantial net outflow of 3.66 billion yuan, foreign banks had a net outflow of 8.3 billion yuan, while the major clearinghouses had a net inflow of 610 million yuan, and the minor clearinghouses had a net inflow of 2.73 billion yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Strong Sales, Easy Money; Rice Prices Rise Again and Again <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>White rice closes at a high of 42,000 yuan; Edible Oil Market Initially Firm, Eventually Retreats; Flour Demand Strong</p>
<p>Rice prices continue to rise. With easy money at the start of trading, all types of rice in the South Market increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The Central Market briefly saw a slight dip, but due to strong sales and easy money, prices rose again at the close. White rice closed at 42,000 yuan, up 4,500 yuan, while both thin and early rice rose by 3,500 yuan. In the North Market, ordinary glutinous and thin rice rose by 3,000 yuan, and special glutinous rice reached 43,500 yuan. Total arrivals in both markets amounted to 6,111 piculs.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Prices rose sharply at the opening but fell back at the close, both influenced by the ease and tightness of the money market. Rapeseed oil saw a significant increase, opening at 165,000 yuan and closing at 154,000 yuan, a rise of 8,000 yuan. Soybean oil closed at 160,000 yuan, up 9,000 yuan. A good barrel of raw oil was at 200,000, opening at 198,000 yuan, up 14,000 yuan. Soybean cake rose by 1,000 yuan, with a weak close.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Prices generally rose by 10%. At the start, with easy money, demand from buyers was strong, and with gold prices soaring, market sentiment was very firm. Old brand flour once traded as high as 17,655 yuan, and military ship flour even broke the 17,000 yuan mark. Later, rumors of central bank intervention caused the money market to tighten, and sellers became cautious. Hearing that outside the circle the market was weakening, holders, wary of holding high positions, rushed to sell, and the market eventually declined. Military ship flour traded at 16,830 yuan, and old brand flour was offered at 17,600 yuan, but there were few takers.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>At the start, with rice prices soaring, market sentiment was uniformly bullish. Yellow beans rose sharply by 10%, and car beans traded as high as 33,000 yuan. Winter beans were in demand from out-of-town buyers, rising by an average of 15%. Later, with oil cake weakening and implicit interest rates rising, many holders sold off, and prices fell back by 500 yuan. Raw peanuts rose again, and sesame prices rose rapidly by over 10%. Corn prices fell due to quiet activity from the Green Gang.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Rises</p>
<p>Tung oil prices rose immediately after the market opened yesterday, spurred by the uniform increase in public utility and shipping costs, which greatly stimulated the market. Soon after, with easy money within the industry and the sudden rise in goods outside the industry, market sentiment became even more excited, demand overflowed, and sellers took the opportunity to bid up prices, causing a surge in prices. By the close, each grade had risen by a significant 15,000 yuan, and the foothold was also quite solid.</p>
<p>Tea Market Rises Again</p>
<p>Since tea stocks have been steadily declining, sellers regard the small amount of old stock they hold as rare commodities, refusing to sell easily. However, export box tea is difficult to sell due to prices being higher than overseas tea prices, resulting in a prolonged period of quiet trading, while prices have repeatedly risen.</p>
<p>Domestic tea from this street and other places showed some interest, but trading was limited, and underlying momentum was unwilling to settle for less than soaring prices.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the "pre-Qingming new tea" of Longjing green tea, which is specifically for domestic sale, is developing very well this year due to the favorable weather. It is said that tea from the Wenzhou production area will arrive in Shanghai in about two weeks. However, according to middlemen, tea prices are mostly calculated based on rice prices. Given the current situation, it is expected that the opening price of new tea this year will be a surprise.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Wood Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Wood prices rose sharply due to the easing of monetary conditions and the renewed bullish sentiment after the release of the cost of living index. Except for plywood, which remained the same as the previous day, other types of wood such as foreign pine, wood pine chips, fir, Tanhu wood, and red willow boards all rose by about 10%. However, Hangzhou wood saw the most significant increase, jumping from 130,000 to 180,000 yuan per tael, with select goods reaching as high as 200,000 yuan. It is said that this is due to the military purchasing 200,000 pieces, resulting in a severe shortage of market stock.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Cigarettes and Soap Rise Sharply <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Cigarettes and soap both saw a sharp increase, due to the soaring cost of living, the easing of monetary conditions, and the day's lending rate falling to as low as seven cents. The opening prices all rose by over 10% amidst frequent favorable news. White tin-packaged cigarettes reached a new high of 8,000 yuan, a sharp increase of over 500 yuan. Twenty-piece British cigarettes went beyond 3,000 yuan to 3,360 yuan, also a sharp increase of 340 yuan.</p>
<p>The rise in soap prices was even more severe. Guben soap hit 66,000 yuan, a surge of 4,000 yuan. Beautiful Matches closed at a new high of 320,000 yuan, also a surge of 70,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands closed at 150,000 yuan, all rising by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Cotton Yarn Prices Hold Firm; Cloth Market Slightly Firmer at the Close <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Cotton yarn prices held firm, as the monetary situation eased and market sentiment turned bullish. Holders, due to cost considerations, were reluctant to sell, and there was little activity from out-of-town buyers, with speculators dominating the market. Initial firmness in prices eventually gave way, with a slight upward trend at the close.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix nearly reached 3 million yuan, but gradually declined, closing as low as 2.85 million yuan, still up 190,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 120,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon rose by 140,000 yuan, ending at 1.83 million yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods declined from 1.495 million yuan to 1.445 million yuan at the close, still up 45,000 yuan, with factory orders last done at 1.44 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse was at 1.37 million yuan, a rise of 100,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Other brands like Jincheng and Tiannv were still active, rising by about 120,000 yuan each, with 16-count yarn generally rising by 100,000 yuan, and 10-count Boy Scout hitting the 1 million yuan mark.</p>
<p>The cloth market, buoyed by the gains in the outside market yesterday afternoon, opened higher. However, short sellers remained active, and direct sales did not improve. Individual holders lacked support and rushed to close positions, causing various cloths to fall into a soft market. At the close, many short positions were covered, and the market slightly recovered.</p>
<p>Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 60,000 yuan, once reaching a high of 60,500 yuan before declining to a low of 58,500 yuan, closing at 59,000 yuan, up 8,000 yuan from the previous day. Trumpet Boy fine cloth rose by 5,000 yuan, ending at 54,000 yuan.</p>

In the afternoon, prices in the outside market were slightly higher, with Dragon Head fine cloth at 62,000 yuan and Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge at 59,500 yuan.</p>

<p>Mercerized feather yarn has been selling well recently. Various merchants with unobstructed transportation continue to have demand, and Western clothing tailors, woolen cloth and satin foreign goods stores in this street also have healthy buying interest, due to the surge in Western suit business, which increases the use of linings. Gray and light colors are especially popular. On the selling price front, due to the high cost of silk yarn raw materials and dyes, and the rising cost of living, all prices are rising. Yesterday, dyed special grade feather yarn was quoted at 2,450 yuan per yard wholesale, first grade at 1,900 yuan, second grade at 1,600 yuan, and third grade at 1,300 yuan.</p>

<p>The Small Factory Loan program, organized by the Central Bank's Lending Committee, has been decided to end on the 19th of this month. The reason is that the Lunar New Year holiday has passed, and the number of applicants has dwindled. Furthermore, the Central Bank's Lending Committee believes that the emergency relief is over and intends to end the program soon. According to inquiries made by reporters, if special circumstances arise, whether exceptions can be made. It was reported that if such circumstances are encountered and the facts are verified, loans can be granted under the emergency industrial loan method, referring to the small industrial loan regulations. However, this must be done through a bank. The agent bank can be freely recommended by the applicant manufacturer.</p>

<h3 id="e134">British Troops Lack Strategy, Missing the Final Shot; Qingbai Cleverly Scores Twice <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The British Navy football team, despite their bravery, lacked strategy. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, they played their third match at the Yiyuan Stadium and lost 2-0 to the city champions, Qingbai. Although the British controlled the game and launched a fierce attack for eighty minutes, they failed to score a single goal, returning with a duck egg. Qingbai, on the other hand, produced unexpected players, scoring one goal in each half, winning the game 2-0. The Yiyuan Stadium was quite lively, with the largest crowd of spectators for the British Navy's three matches, estimated at over 2,000 people.</p>
<p>The British Navy's lineup yesterday was again a new face, changing for the third consecutive game, but still failing to achieve a victory. In addition to the soldiers from the flagship HMS London, several players from the HMS Cossack were added, making it a mixed formation. The team's style consistently adhered to the British Navy's policy of bold, sweeping, long-ball play, prioritizing attack over defense, with no hesitation. Unfortunately, the forwards did not bring their shooting boots. The Qingbai goal was heavily guarded, and the sound of thuds was constant, but they could not break through once. Their inaccuracy in shooting was such that the British Navy's defeat was due to this. Apart from the strong British central defense line, two new soldiers from the HMS Cossack were brought in on the wings yesterday, two short men who ran very fast. Several corner kicks were well executed, but there were often no receivers. Qingbai was heavily guarded, achieving nothing. The defenders only focused on advancing to assist in the attack, bravely and directly. When Qingbai launched a counterattack, they were helpless. Both goals conceded were due to the same mistake.</p>
<p>Qingbai defended more than they attacked, resulting in a victory. In the first half, they were almost entirely under the British attack. Facing cannonball shots, Huang Shijie caught and dived repeatedly, sending out several extremely dangerous balls, keeping Qingbai's defense intact. Huang Shijie deserves the most credit. Due to the British Navy's fierce attack, Meng Yiliang had to retreat to the third defender position to protect the territory. The central and rear defenders sometimes lined up in front of the goal to deal with the British, showing the fierceness of their attack. The forwards and defenders were therefore disconnected, but Xiao Luo was still the most active. Jin Lusheng scored the first goal in the first half, and Luo Shoufu scored the second goal in the second half. With their clever short passes, they finally overwhelmed the enemy.</p>
<p>Referee Zhang Le, linesmen He Chunhui and Ge Laixu. At 4:00 PM sharp, the British Navy kicked off and attacked. After being blocked by Qingbai, the ball went back and forth, returning to Qingbai's territory. The British immediately attacked with all their strength. Center Sims dribbled straight, but Meng Yiliang tackled him and fell to the ground. Sims took a shot at the goal from twenty yards out, but the ball flew over the crossbar. Bo Peiqi came back strongly, also firing a long-range shot, but it failed to hit the target, already giving Qingbai a scare. Qian Changrong used his left foot to hook the ball twice in front of the goal, but the ball went towards his own goal, fortunately saved by Huang Shijie. While the British were attacking vigorously, Xiao Luo suddenly emerged, intercepting the ball, circling left and right, dribbling straight in, and passing it to Jin Lusheng. British Navy defender Taitley, seeing the danger, rushed from the left. Jin Lusheng shot fiercely at the goal, but it hit Taitley's foot and bounced out. Jin added another shot, and Taitman was unable to save it. Within five minutes, the British Navy's goal had fallen. The British Navy did not lose heart due to this goal and continued to attack fiercely. The attack did not weaken, and the wings were especially active. The five forwards surrounded Qingbai, and Huang Shijie was busy with a lot of business, unable to respond in time. Under the leadership of Meng Yiliang, Qingbai became five defenders. Xiao Luo occasionally broke through, but Liu Tiyin caught up and failed to score, which was a great pity. Once, British right winger Moore advanced straight along the sideline, deceived Qian Changrong, and ran straight to the goal, passing to the center. Pan Tuoxun took a hook shot, which was extremely dangerous, but Zhang Shijie jumped up and saved it. Missile shots from McCes and Bo Peiqi continued to come, all falling into the barren wilderness. The British Navy's feet were not working, and their efforts were in vain. After forty minutes in the first half, Qingbai led by one goal.</p>
<p>After a ten-minute break, the situation slightly changed. The British Navy's morale was not as strong as in the first half, and the battle became more relaxed. Qingbai's forwards stood out, becoming active in the British Navy's territory. Both sides went back and forth for five or six minutes. The British Navy advanced from the left, charging to the front of the goal. Jiang Luqian intercepted and killed, passing the ball forward. Xue Peiran received it and broke through, dribbling straight in, penetrating deep into the British Navy's territory. Luo Shoufu also came for a relay race, single-handedly, circling left once and right once, deceiving both defenders, and going straight to the front of the goal. Taitman waited to be tied up, and with a shot at the goal, the British Navy's goal fell again. Qingbai's victory was secured, seeming effortless. Although the British Navy was still attacking, it was clearly at the end of their rope. After thirty minutes, two points came down, and the last ten minutes ended in a calm manner.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Basketball Group A: Two Games Tonight; Hualian Re-encounters Huili; Enkas vs. Mai Ling Fight Postponed <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>There were originally three games in the basketball league's Group A today, including two in Group A1: Mai Lings re-encountering Enkas, and Hualian facing Huili again. However, the first game between Mai En was postponed due to the American Naval and Marine Youth Association Boxing Championships, with both sides requesting a postponement. The Basketball Committee approved the postponement and cancelled the order for that game, postponing the opening game of Group A2, West Qing Lan vs. Kang Team, to 6:30 PM. Starting today, ticket prices have been adjusted to 500 yuan upstairs, 1,000 yuan downstairs, and 1,500 yuan for assigned seats in the arena. The list of orders and referees is recorded first as follows:</p>
<p>West Qing Lan - Kang Team (Group A2) 6:30 PM Referees: Wu Xiaodi, Li Zhenzhong</p>
<p>Hualian - Huili (Group A1) 7:30 PM Referees: Chen Baolin, Jiang Yinseng</p>
<p>In the first game of Group A2, Kang Team will face West Qing Lan. Led by veteran Lu Dazhen, Kang Team has skilled players such as Tong Tingxuan and Rong Chengen. Most of the players are young and strong, full of fighting spirit. However, in this group, their schedule has arranged for them to face strong opponents one after another. They have suffered two defeats against Hua Dong Mao Xun. Although they won against You Yi, their hope of winning the championship is slim. West Qing Lan has won and lost half of their two games. Although the team's skills are not particularly outstanding, their speed is fast, and they are agile, making them a match for Kang Team. When the two teams meet, there will definitely be a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Following that, in Group A1, Hualian will face Huili again. Hualian is the leader of the Shanghai league. Although they lost to Pei Fei Er in the current league, they have won all of their other eight games, so their leading position is secure. Tonight, they will face Huili again, who they have previously defeated. They know their strength and strategy in detail, so they should be able to win again. However, Huili is not to be underestimated. Tian Fuhai, Cao Zhiji, and Wang Yongfang are all brave and fierce generals. Since Hua Yunshan, Chen Zhengmiao, and others have joined the team, their lineup has become more complete. Having been humiliated in the first round, they are harboring resentment. When they meet on a narrow road, they will definitely do their best to achieve revenge. A bloody battle is inevitable. The team rosters for the four teams are attached below:</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Wu Xinyun, the "scoring key" of Ren Yu, known for his mid-range shooting, was ambushed and injured his left foot in the game against Enkas the previous evening. After a doctor's diagnosis, it was revealed that the bone in the back of his foot had been broken by a kick. He cannot engage in strenuous exercise during the treatment period. Wu has moved from the training camp back to his home to rest since last night. It is feared that Wu will not be able to play in this year's league again.</p>
<p>It is reported that since Ren Yu suffered a defeat at the hands of Enkas in the second game of the first week of this league, they have been training in a residential camp, vowing to avenge the defeat. They have made significant progress in every game since then. After defeating Hu Jing and Mai Lings, they defeated Enkas with four points, winning seven out of nine games, making them the only team capable of threatening Hualian's dominance. Now, with this blow, although the runner-up is still possible, it is feared that it will be difficult to shake Hualian's position in the league.</p>

<p>[Taipei Airmail] The Norwegian merchant ship Acton's crew team and the Taiwan Bank football team held a football match at Taipei Park yesterday (the 13th) afternoon. The audience reached 3,000 people, and it was very lively. The Norwegian team wore red striped vests and were broad and fat, while the Taiwan Bank team wore old blue and yellow vests. The referee was He Weijing, the captain of the Taiwan Bank team was Bao Liangyu, and the team roster was as follows: Feng Chengzhi, Chen Xiaozun, Chen Zunchang, Wang Yijun, Liu Xudong, Lin Junxian, Wang Mengjian, Zhang Xiaofeng, Guo Kunlin, Zhao Qiuzhou, (above) Wang Chengdan (below). The game started at 2:00 PM. Although the Norwegian team's players were large and strong, their movements were clumsy. The Taiwan Bank football team, having been through many battles, had clever flanking attacks and ambushes. The Norwegian team showed its inferiority from the start. Taiwan Bank saw its weakness in the first two rounds. Wang Yijun, Wang Mengjian, and Lin Junxian each scored a goal one after another, with Taiwan Bank winning the first half 3-0. In the second half, Taiwan Bank's Zhao Qiuzhou left the field, and Wang Chengdan took his place. The Norwegian team's players did not substitute. In the second half, the Norwegian team's morale was weak, the formation was chaotic, and communication was poor. Lin Junxian and Wang Mengjian scored two more goals. Finally, Taiwan Bank's Zhang Xiaofeng also easily kicked a goal from the front, with Taiwan Bank ultimately winning 6-1 against Norway.</p>
<h3 id="e140">New Rules Applied in British Basketball Games <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 16th] New rules have been applied to British basketball games since January 1st. One of the latest rules is to expand the "free throw" area. According to this new rule, the "free throw" area has been doubled, and no player may remain in the free throw area for more than three seconds. This change prevents tall players from staying under the basket to catch the ball and shoot.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Hong Kong Tennis: Enthusiastic Start, Ye Guanhong Highly Favored in Singles, Xu Family Showing Strong Form in Doubles <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>[Hong Kong, 16th Dispatch] Tennis is gradually becoming a craze in Hong Kong. Many people in the sports circle are happily picking up tennis rackets to learn. This tennis championship, hosted by our club, is worthy of praise. It can truly be said to be organized from a "purely sports perspective."</p>
<p>After yesterday's matches, the preliminary elimination work for both singles and doubles has been completed. The final eight pairs of "seeded players" in both singles and doubles have emerged one after another.</p>
<p>The eight singles players have now reached the stage of competing for the semi-finals. According to established practice, our club only charges admission fees during the semi-finals of open tournaments.</p>
<p>Last year, our club erected temporary stands, hoping to collect more admission fees, but things didn't go as planned. Ye Guanhong was unable to participate in the final singles match due to a rain-induced schedule change (he had to rush to Shanghai to participate in the National Games), so revenue was far from ideal.</p>
<p>Present-day Hong Kong is truly a miracle. In any ball game, Chinese players hold the greatest advantage. Among the eight seeded singles players, only Siklan and Horton are foreigners. In the final eight doubles pairs, only Zhong Shi, Aiyashi, Siklan, and Stokes have foreigners; the rest are all Chinese players.</p>
<p>In this year's singles and doubles, Ye Guanhong is still the most favored champion in singles. In doubles, the two Xus seem to be in a strong position to win the title.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this reason, the outcome of the championship doesn't seem to have major variations. In other words, the entire competition process is just going to be ordinary and dull and not attract high interest of fans.</p>
<p>Javanese player Li Wencheng, when returning to his country to participate in the National Games last year, passed through Hong Kong with his younger brother Wenxuan. At that time, they performed at our club's court. General observation was that he had potential.</p>
<p>This year, Wencheng is participating in the singles competition on his own, and also partnering with Chen Decan in the doubles competition. Chen Decan is also a "promising" player. If he participated in the singles competition, he would also "make a name."</p>
<p>I feel that Decan's high-altitude shots and net interceptions are no worse than Wencheng's, and his resilience is even better than Wencheng's.</p>
<p>Speaking of "resilience," last year, Siklan emerged. This year, there is another Qu Jinman. It is a pity that Jinman lacks stamina. Otherwise, following in Tao Guanqiu's footsteps, creating another style of "play" with long baseline shots, he could also become a good player.</p>
<p>If long baseline shots are powerful and well-placed, they not only force opponents to be unable to go to the net but also have to use long shots to cope. If the opponent is not good at playing this "hand," then it is an opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Women's Basketball Tactics <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Qi Gong</p>
<p>The zone defense and the moving zone defense are different. In addition to being responsible for the area they guard, each defender must watch the overall movement, coordinate closely with the other two guards, and change positions in response. They must watch the dynamics of the other three attackers and determine a coordinated response. This method is mobile. If there is a skillful performance and cooperative collaboration, it is like a fan-shaped swing, taking the initiative to move to disturb the ball-carrying attacker.</p>
<p>In terms of defensive tactics, the man-to-man defense is certainly important, but under certain circumstances, it can be changed from a man-to-man defense to a moving zone defense. The zone defense allows players to have a clear performance, the chance of fouls is less, and the results are greater. If the defending player has a sense of premonition and accurately sees the opponent's passing action, it is easy to intercept the opponent's forward pass from the middle. This method is enough to cope with various offensive methods of the opponent. If the opponent's forward is not good at mid-range shooting but is good at forcing close to the basket to score, the defensive area can specifically protect the strongpoint near the basket to defend, so that the opponent's forward cannot get a chance to rush into the free throw area in the keyhole to shoot. If the opponent's forward is good at long-range shooting, the guard should expand the defensive area.</p>
<p>The moving zone defense is better than the fixed zone defense. The latter is rarely effective when used. If three of the opponent's forwards gather in one area to launch an offensive, using one guard to defend against three forwards in a fixed manner is tantamount to an螳臂擋車 (idiom: an ant trying to fell a tree - overestimating one's capabilities). It is easy for the opponent to break through the defensive formation with a three-on-one attack. Therefore, the essence of the moving zone defense is analyzed in detail in the next section.</p>
<p>There are also several types of moving zone defense. Each type has its own different tactics, and each must be based on the method used by the opponent's forward when attacking to be conducive to the guard's defense. Now, let's talk about two defensive methods that are beneficial to the guards.</p>
<p>(A) To use this method, there must be a tall, agile player who can move flexibly to serve as the center guard.</p>
<p>Her position is in front of the free throw line, managing the center semicircle of the basket, 15 feet from the semicircle's radius. She must try to prevent the opponent's center from passing the ball or　entering the lane to shoot. When the opponent's center is approaching directly with the ball, the center guard must slow down the ball carrier's forward speed. She may pass the ball to her teammates. The center guard must keep the center outside the circumference while letting her two guards move their formation with the location of the ball to take a defensive posture.</p>
<p>In this situation, the other two guards are all concentrated on the left to defend due to the location of the ball, or all concentrated on the right to defend, or divided into left and right to take a defensive posture.</p>
<p>When the opponent's forward has a rushing-in shooting motion, each guard immediately changes to a man-to-man defense system, tightly guarding the forward closest to you, and the duty of the center guard is to try to guard the last forward who enters the formation with the ball, hindering her from easily getting the chance to shoot.</p>
<p>This moving zone system's tactic is to permeate the man-to-man defense system, which is more complicated to use, and not easy for novice teams to understand and use. Each player must be clear-headed, distinguishing when to use the moving zone defense system and when to adapt to the situation and change to a man-to-man defense system due to the enemy's changing formation.</p>
<p>Under this defensive system, each guard cannot be designated to guard a certain area in front. If a guard wants to be able to control the area they are guarding effectively, it depends on the guard's agility, skillful performance, and even more so on keen judgment. (To be continued in the next installment)</p>
<h3 id="e143">Reflections from a Sphere-Loving Circle <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>I met a first-rate fan, a complete stranger, in a teahouse. We struck up a conversation, and he was so talkative, his emotions overflowing, and with such insightful opinions.</p>
<p>He said: Not just after the war, but even long before it, football, this sacred sport, has long been a perverted sports "valve," a tool for doing business! Now that living is becoming increasingly constricted, even "football stars" have been turned into commodities. Since the skills sold by "athletes" vary in quality, this also determines the price of this individual talent!</p>
<p>Of course, I cannot completely deny that there are those who truly play sports for the sake of sports, but in an atmosphere where the playing field is the marketplace, most people have a subconscious "if you don't do it, you're not a hero" mentality and dare not try anything easily. Those who "protect their own wisdom" avoid causing controversy, so they prefer to stand by and act as spectators. As a result, there are fewer and fewer friends who really understand how to run sports, and the team has been messed up into the current situation.</p>
<p>The same player, under the "pull" and "lure" of two clubs, can sell himself before the procedures are completed, refuse to attend, give up being selected, and be unwilling for his club's players to participate in local competitions to avoid injury. Even for the sake of not wanting to expand expenses and saving "players," the team is incomplete. Although it is said that 30 percent of these strange phenomena have real reasons, I dare to guarantee that 70 percent are due to the unpleasant phenomena caused by the factors of "not being able to bear losses" and "not wanting to be used by others."</p>
<p>The existence of a sports organization is sacred in principle, but because of the income from tickets, it has aroused the prejudice of some who have a unique business sense. After several calculations of the ins and outs of this income, the desire for profit is alarming, so it has led to the deformed development of pulling strings. The athletes who possess the skills cannot help but "understand the advantages and disadvantages" and wait for the price to be sold, choosing the best offer. Thus, there are three types of football in Hong Kong: 1. Transcendent amateurism, 2. Vague semi-professionalism, 3. Open professionalism.</p>
<p>The first type, in terms of the nature of the club, does not care about winning or losing, welcomes those who come, does not retain those who leave, and does not insist on winning championships. This detached style, of course, has achieved some technical contributions from many groups in terms of technical advancement. The reason is that there are too few truly staunch and self-confident talents. Even if they work hard, they will have a little improvement. However, little do they know, the mantis is behind them. The organizers hold this feeling of not being worthy of making wedding clothes for others, so they are perfunctory and lack the heavenly duty of helping others and helping themselves. Their abandonment of their posts is also a negative organization that blocks talent.</p>
<p>The second type can be said to be a sports organization that specializes in manufacturing murky news in the sports world. Because it is half-open and half-closed, it certainly absorbs a group of famous players of various levels. The talent is the most complicated, and the methods are also chaotic and disorganized. The organizers cage them with various different faces and tricks, and they are uneasy morning and evening. Even if one or two new blood are suddenly discovered, the preferential treatment is unequal, or the person in charge deliberately makes a mystery, which eventually leads to resignation without saying goodbye, abandonment of attendance, or in a state of wavering of bargaining, there is simply no way to develop the concrete tactics of the entire team.</p>
<p>The third type should represent the measuring instrument of the overall local technical level. The organization is of course the most sound, and the capital should be the most abundant. Even if you use a business eye to estimate, the result should also be "fame and fortune." However, the fact is still not as optimistic as that. I believe the organizers still cannot escape "crying bitterly," complaining and blaming themselves. The problem is that Hong Kong already lacks first-class foreign teams as opponents. What about the internal strife between the Chinese? The essence of Hong Kong has been divided too clearly. The relative strength between veterans and new recruits is far different. One-sided, there is no value to appreciate. The audience is not interested, and income is of course affected. Therefore, the huge expenses may not be able to be compensated easily. In terms of technology, it is getting worse and worse. To be honest, the refinement of technology is honed from hard struggle. In a competition where you can do whatever you want, how can the level of football not go downhill?</p>
<p>These declining phenomena can be said to be bad traditions passed down from the entire sports social structure. If this evil custom exists for one day, the level of football technology cannot be improved for one day. I think that in the current football world, if there are not enough talents and teams to be fully professional, the Sports Association should stand up and make the greatest effort to urge the organs to implement the equal distribution system of players, award players with suitable occupations, and make a fixed and reasonable adjustment to the relationship with the parent club. The club should use the money obtained from sports for sports, and the players should delve deeply in the spirit of further study. Under the goal of equal strength of each club, they should learn from each other. Everyone should take football technology as the premise. Whether Hong Kong football has brilliant achievements depends on whether our group, who stands in the sports post, can constantly reflect and review! (You Xinnong from Xiangdao)</p>

<h3 id="e144">Talking about Folk Songs <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Sang</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, folk songs from various places—especially Mongolia and Xinjiang—were also brought to the Jiangnan region of Jinghu (Nanjing and Shanghai) along with the demobilization. Folk songs are the healthy voice of the nation. Not only can you see the customs and geographical environment of a place in the lyrics, but also in its composition, you can see the national character and simple culture of the local people. For example, Mongolian and Xinjiang folk songs often have nouns such as camels and grasslands. Folk songs from Suiyuan often mention the city walls of the Great Wall.</p>
<p>The tunes of folk songs are very simple, and its accompanying instruments are equally simple. Because the occurrence of folk songs was originally on the great prairie, the sandy shores, or in the mountains, and was produced by the response of the crowd. Therefore, although most folk songs cannot escape the love between men and women, they only have a simple, original taste, and there is no yellow ingredient mixed in.</p>
<p>Recently, many orthodox musicians have also gradually paid attention to and studied these folk songs. The "Running Horse Liuliu," "Shali Hongba Ai," and "Youth Dance Music" sung by Madam Guan are an indication of this trend. It is a pity that when Shanghai people sing folk songs, they often bring a bit of "靡靡" (decadent) sound, which not only disappoints the painstaking efforts of the promoters but also completely loses the meaning of folk songs.</p>
<p>Some musicians, in addition to collecting folk songs from the folk community, also want to promote it using the "taking the result as the cause" method. That is, first make lyrics and scores according to the local people's feelings, and then promote them to the folk community. "Everyone Sings" and "Teahouse Serenade" are the products of this method.</p>
<p>If this method is undertaken by composers who truly go deep into the folk community, it will of course be a powerful help to folk songs; otherwise, it will inevitably become affected and pretentious. Even more, there are some philistine music vendors who take advantage of this opportunity to add a lot of yellow elements, which not only negates the advantages of folk songs but also is a major obstacle to the future of folk songs.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Can Divorce Be Avoided? <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Binzhi</p>
<p>Divorce is an unfortunate event in families. Although it is legally permissible, it always feels a bit unpleasant in terms of human feelings. Even judges, when dealing with such cases, must infuse some emotional factors and never easily let a couple who were originally in love be separated.</p>
<p>Keninghan is a judge who, from his experience, has come to a conclusion on handling divorce cases: mediation from family relationships is more effective than trial in court. He tried his theory in the 77 divorce cases he handled in a month, and as a result, 18 cases were completely reconciled; in 35 cases, he asked them to cohabit for one or two months, and they were also reconciled later; only 24 estranged couples were really unable to reconcile and had to divorce.</p>
<p>When Keninghan hears divorce cases, he first asks the man and woman whether there is a possibility of reconciliation. If one party believes that reconciliation is possible, he will not ask further questions. He takes the couple and their lawyers to another room for negotiations. However, the parents of the man and woman are not allowed to participate. Keninghan may be able to say that the couple will get back together within 15 minutes. He uses various opportunities to explain the possible encounters after divorce. To the woman, he says: If you remarry after divorce, will the new husband be dissatisfied, jealous, or abuse the children born to your ex-husband? Can you tolerate it? To the man, he says: After the divorce, you have to pay alimony to your ex-wife, and at the same time, the family expenses cannot be reduced, which will increase your burden. At the same time, your second wife will give you trouble because you have to pay your ex-wife alimony. However, this kind of talk is not very effective for young couples who have no children. They do not believe in the various troubles and pains after divorce, so they often cause disputes, and the result is divorce.</p>
<p>Using Keninghan's method, according to himself, whether mediation can succeed depends on the first 15 minutes. If during this period, both parties still believe that there is no possibility of reconciliation, and one party is too emotional, there is little hope of reconciliation. The easiest to handle are young couples with children. Once, a young couple glared at each other when they came in, but were exceptionally loving when they went out. They said to Keninghan: We have forgotten the scene when we came in just now.</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Qin Mirror <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital contains a passage about the treasures of the Qin Palace, saying: "When Gaozu entered the Xianyang Palace, he walked around the treasury, and the gold, jade, and treasures were countless. There was a square mirror, four feet wide and five feet nine inches high, with clear surfaces inside and out. When people came to look directly at it, their shadows would be seen upside down. If they came with their hands touching their hearts, their intestines, stomach, and five internal organs would be seen clearly without any obstruction. If a person had a disease inside, they would cover their heart and look at it, and they would know where the disease was. Also, if a woman had evil intentions, her gall would be dilated and her heart would beat. Emperor Qin Shi Huang often used it to look at the palace women, and those whose gall was dilated and whose hearts beat would be killed. Gaozu used it to deal with Xiang Yu, who took it to the east with him, and its whereabouts are unknown." According to this record, it is a bit like today's "X-ray," and it can see the "evil intentions of women," so its effectiveness is even greater than "X-ray." It is a pity that Xiang Yu took it to the east, and its whereabouts are unknown. Otherwise, it could be used to illuminate the "conscience" of today's people. Does it exist? Is it white or black? If one were hung on a main thoroughfare, overlooking all living beings, I think it would be pitch black.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The Contradiction of Rationing Certificates <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Tanke</p>
<p>The rice rationing certificates for March require the exchange of the "No. 7" shopping certificate on the national identity card. In addition to the joy that the shopping certificate has finally "been used," the common people feel a little inexplicable about this redundant move by the government.</p>
<p>A total of 15 市斤 (a unit of weight) of rice is rationed per month. In order to learn about fashion (price increases), the 15 市斤 of rationed rice are distributed in three distributions in order to track market prices and have some flexibility, - in fact, of course, there is only stretching and no shrinking, and this is not mentioned, because at least there is some reason. Only this trick of exchanging rationing certificates with shopping certificates is too confusing. Since you have to get the rice rationing certificate with the shopping certificate, and it must be No. 7, then why not just directly ration the rice with the shopping certificate? What is the purpose of this extra move? Could it be that there are two No. 7 shopping certificates on everyone's national identity card? If it is said that rice is still distributed three times, is it not enough to use the twelve shopping certificates scheduled per month?</p>
<p>This move, in terms of preventing fraud, can be said to be 100% empty. Rationing rice directly with the shopping certificate will not cause the merchants who print the rationing certificate to close down. Would it not be much better to transfer this printing paper cost to meaningful and necessary expenses!</p>

<p>There is such a proverb in England: If you want an hour of happiness, you go and drink; if you want three days of happiness, then get married; if you want eight days of happiness, then kill and eat your pig. But if you want eternal happiness, then become a gardener.</p>

<p>— Sang</p>
<p>English poet Kipling, at the peak of his career, received as much as one shilling per word for his manuscripts.</p>
<p>French prolific writer Balzac, who has the reputation of "Napoleon of Literature," often had to revise his drafts up to ten times. He was in debt all year round, so he had to dare to go out only at night.</p>
<p>"Russian Maupassant" Chekhov admitted that half of his literary activities were to subsidize household expenses and complete his studies, and half were purely entertainment.</p>
<p>Italian writer D'Annunzio can be considered the most superstitious, so superstitious that he did not even dare to wash his hair on Fridays.</p>
<p>Zola often went hungry when he first started his literary career, and even had to spend the winter wearing only one set of underwear.</p>
<p>Maeterlinck liked stimulation, so his hobbies were boxing and driving cars and motorcycles. He hated music, but often attended concerts to appreciate women.</p>
<p>American writer Edgar Allan Poe was simply crazy about the night. As soon as it dawned, he immediately blocked the windows and lit candles in the room, and then continued to work or read. After nightfall, he began to go out for a walk.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Love Tester <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Deyun</p>
<p>A report in Reuters, Bavaria, 7th dispatch: "A love tester is on sale here... This tester can test the love between men and women," and so on.</p>
<p>"Love between men and women" can actually be "tested" by machines, which is really "scientific omnipotence." I think that scientist probably invented this because there are too many men and women who "fall in love at first sight" and can't wait to get married five minutes later.</p>
<p>If it is really effective and can be shipped to Shanghai, I think there will definitely be a lot of people who want to buy it; although it costs "five marks per unit, which is seven shillings and six pence in British gold," it cannot be considered too expensive, because there are many rich people in Shanghai. Moreover, the more money people have, the more their "love" is worth doubting, so it is very possible to "test" it, I think.</p>

<p>According to the new regulations of the Mexican Civil Aviation Administration, foreign passengers are not allowed to hug and kiss local relatives and friends who welcome them when they disembark. This policy has also become popular in London. According to the official reason, foreign passengers often secretly hand over nylon stockings, watches, cosmetics, and other smuggled goods to relatives and friends who welcome them when they hug and kiss, so this kind of smuggling kissing must be prohibited.</p>
<p>American department stores have recently been selling Chinese-style women's folding fans in large quantities, with prices ranging from 50 cents to 50 US dollars per fan. For the purpose of promoting sales, merchants have compiled a fabricated "fan language." For example: "Touching the lips with a fan is to attract a man's kiss," "Dropping a fan is equal to saying that I must meet you alone," "Quickly folding the fan is equal to saying that you are too bold," and so on.</p>
<p>Charles of North Dakota, USA, is probably the person in the world who can write the smallest font. In his recent tour exhibition, he used a hair only three inches long to write Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on the hair, with a total of 1175 letters. Using a microscope to see it, it is clearly distinguishable.</p>
<p>The police department of Atlanta City, USA, recently notified all fashion stores in the city that when they change clothes for the models in the glass windows, they must put down the awnings to avoid injuring the customs.</p>

<p>— Xuren</p>
<p>A: Today, China's foreign policy should not be unilaterally pro-American, nor should it be unilaterally pro-Soviet. It should act as a bridge between them.</p>
<p>B: Your opinion is too dangerous.</p>
<p>A: How do you see it?</p>
<p>B: Although the United States and the Soviet Union are in a cold war today, they have not yet reached the point of fighting with swords and guns. This is because they are separated by a Pacific Ocean. If we become a bridge between them, wouldn't they be able to fight each other with bare blades?</p>
<p>Yesterday's Wisdom Quiz Answer: Because the mirror has only one side, and the glass has two sides</p>
<h3 id="e153">Wine Brick and Shifang Tobacco <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Last year, at the end of the year, Huang Tongwu came down from Guling to Shanghai and invited me to drink at his house. After sitting down, the dishes included dried meat stewed with loach, diced meat stir-fried with Jiangxi fermented black beans, and his wife's own wind-dried chicken and drunken crab. Each person had a very small wine glass in front of them (this glass has a special name called "One Mouth Clear"), but no wine was to be seen. A tall, gray brick was placed beside the table, and it felt extremely hard to the touch. The host took out a small foreign knife from his pocket, cut off a corner of the brick, removed the skin, placed it in a teacup, and poured boiling water over it. After a short while, the aroma of wine rushed into my nose. After waiting for the brick to completely melt and settle, he poured it into the small wine glass with a teaspoon and drank it. It was fragrant, mellow, and potent, truly the best Fen wine from Shanxi. Tongwu said, "People in Shanxi make wine in the summer. They put the brick into the first batch of wine to soak for about half a day, then take it out and put it under the hot sun to dry. The bricks from Shanxi are even sturdier than those made by people from Shandong, so they don't melt. After drying, they are put back into the wine pot to soak. They do this more than ten times, and the alcohol is completely absorbed into the brick. When going on a long trip, carrying a few bricks is convenient because you have good wine to drink and they are easy to carry." Tongwu's ancestors once had a ticket shop in Xiantao Town, Shashi, Hubei, and those in charge were from Jiexiu and Pingyao counties in Shanxi. Although the ticket shop has closed down, they still have contact with people from Shanxi, so I was able to taste his brick-infused Fen wine.</p>
<p>The brain and meat stewed loach soup was extremely rich and had no muddy taste. Surprised, I asked about it. Tongwu said, "Whenever you eat sea loach, you must first put them in a water basin and raise them for two or three days, changing the clean water frequently, until they have completely expelled the mud from their stomachs before cooking them. Only then can you get their unique flavor."</p>
<p>After the meal, while chatting casually, his wife took out a long paper package from the inner room. Opening it, it contained tobacco leaves wrapped in vegetable leaves. Each leaf was folded, and when unfolded, it was about two feet long and as thick as a finger. She took two or three leaves, cut them into several sections, removed the veins from the leaves, rolled them up, and glued them together, instantly creating several cigars. Smoking them, they tasted fragrant and rich, no different from Cuban cigars. Tongwu said that these were Shifang leaves from Sichuan (near Chengdu), sent by his sworn brother from Guan County.</p>
