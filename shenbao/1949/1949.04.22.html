<h3>中共悍然下令總攻　荻港附近共軍登陸　蕪湖至銅陵間展開大戰</h3>
<p>〔本報二十一南京二十一電〕在平進行廿日之和談，已由於中共於廿一日午宣佈總攻而告破裂·政府對中共所提出之答覆，中共竟未於予考慮，反於政府拒絕中共所提之苛刻條件為辭，由毛澤東朱德下令向政府區進攻，事實上葉於廿日開始之江北攻勢，廿一日更轉激烈，共軍且不頭一切在荻港附近強渡長江，以逐其武力征服全國之野心，戰端於是再開，政府現正準備應戰，俾予迷信武力者以打擊。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕自毛澤東朱德正式下總攻聲令後，江南局勢頓形緊張，京滬杭　總湯總司令恩伯，為打擊共軍屏障江南，廿一長八時特由滬轉機飛京孝陵衛坐鎮，並指揮一切·又空軍總司令周至柔，廿一日下午二時由京專機赴沿江前線上空視察，至下午四時許始返</p>
<h3>南京安廣間略圖</h3>
<p>〔本報蕪湖廿一日電〕中共發佈總攻擊令後之最大戰門，已於廿日夜起於蕪湖以西之三山鎮，經油坊嘴，花犁，獲港至銅陵之長約白華里濱江地區正式展開。該區長江北岸之陳毅部第廿四，廿五，廿七等三個車，首先由土橋，李家渡一帶侵佔江中之黑沙，雪花，太陽，白馬，文與等沙洲，繼於廿日下午五時起，集中炮兵向江南猛烈炮擊，沿江國軍工事大部被毀，廿日晚十一時起，乃以各式船隻餘艘，戰運共軍七八千，在南岸登陸，經國軍奮勇阻擊後，戰至廿一日黎明前，西起銅陵經順安，繁昌，東至橫山，三山鎮之中間地區，悉被攻陷。刻南岸國軍正馳派大軍全力堵擊中。</p>
<p>〔本報蕪湖廿一日電〕廿一日日以繼夜國空軍出動轟擊，并掃射由三山經荻港至銅陵間登陸共軍，共軍除傷亡一部外，大部份皆分散潛伏鄉村田野間，所有該批共軍七八千人，用以渡江之船隻，悉經空軍罩炸毀。惟今入夜後，北岸共軍利用黑夜，不顧轟炸，仍繼續偷渡，同時，白書潛伏之共軍亦開始由繁昌順安等地向南出擊，企圖鞏固并擴展其既佔之南岸橋頭堡，國軍在增援助旅到達後，正反擊中。</p>
<p>〔本報蕪湖廿一日電〕據確悉：此次共軍在荻港附近登陸，擔任該處防務之國軍第八十八軍，據悉除楊軍長率一個特務營已脫險外，其除下落迄廿一日晚尚無法判明。按八十八軍過去系由傘兵總　改編而成，裝備待過較一般部隊為擾，前任軍長馬師恭。</p>
<h3>毛澤東朱德的命令</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕據北平新華電台廣播，全文如次：「毛澤東主席，朱德司令本日向人民解放軍發佈命令如下：</p>
<p>中國人民解放軍第一野戰車劉伯承·鄧小平·張際春諸同志，中國人民解放軍第三野戰車陳毅·　漱石·粟裕·譚震林諸同志，中國人民解放軍第四野戰車林彪·羅榮桓諸同志，太原前線人民解放軍徐向前，周士棣·羅瑞卿諸同志，各野戰車全電指揮員·戰門員同志們，南方各游擊區人民解放軍同志們，由中國共產黨代表團與南京國民黨政府代表團，經過長時間的談判，所擬定的國內和平協定，已被南京國民黨政府所拒絕。南京國民黨政府的負責人員之所以拒絕這個國內和平協定，是因為他們仍然服從美國帝國主義及國民黨匪首蔣介石的命令，企圖阻止中國人民解放事業之推進，阻止用和平方法解決國內問題。經過雙方代表團的談判所擬定的國內和平協定八條二十四款，對於國民黨軍隊官兵及國民黨政府武裝新的寬大處理，對於其他各項問題亦無不是從民族利益與人民利益出發，作了適宜的解決，拒絕這個協定，就是表示國民黨反動派，決心將他們發動的反革命戰爭打到底。拒絕這個協定，就是表示國民黨反動派在今年一月一日所提議的和平談判，不過是企圖阻止人民解放軍向前推進，以便反動派獲得喘息時間，然後捲土重來，撲滅革命勢力。拒絕這個協定，就是表示南京李宗仁政府所謂承認中國八個和平條件，以為談判基礎，是完全虛偽的。因為既然承認懲辦戰爭罪犯，依照民主原則改編一切國民黨反動軍隊，接收南京政府及其所　各級政府的一切權力，以及其他各項基礎條件，就沒有理由拒絕根據這些基礎條件所擬定，而且是極為寬大的各項具體辦法。在此種情況下，我們命令你們：</p>
<p>（一）奮勇前進，堅決，徹底，乾淨，全部約　滅中國境內一切敢於抵抗的國民黨反動派，解放全國人民，保衛中國領土主權的獨立與完整。</p>
<p>（二）奮勇前進，逮捕一切怙惡不　的戰爭罪犯，不管他們逃至何處，均須緝拿匪首蔣介石。</p>
<p>（三）向任何國民黨地方政府及地方軍事集團，宣佈國內和平協定最後修正案，對於凡願停止戰爭，用和平方法解決問題者，你們即可照此最後方案大意和他們簽訂的方性協定。</p>
<p>（四）在人民解放軍包圍南京之後，如果南京李宗仁政府尚未逃散，并願意於國內和平協定上簽字，我們願意再一次給該政府以簽字的機會。中國人民革命軍事委員會主席毛澤東，中國人民解放軍總司令朱德，一九四九年四月二十一日」。</p>
<h3>首都平靜如恆　開赴北岸增援官兵精神抖擻</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕和談破裂後，戰火漸迫首都，自廿日下午起，傳來之炮聲竟夜未絕，至廿一日長十時始漸息止。此間一般情形仍極鎮定，下關江邊廿一日竟日站滿民眾，彼等知昨夜系船隊發炮，故在江邊一儲兵骸之雄姿，車站及街頭秩序如恒，尚未發生如前次疏散時之擁護慌張現象。記者廿一日晚九時赴江邊巡視時，仍見一切平靜，為隱隱開槍聲，若干官兵在江邊列隊等待渡江增援，彼等精神極佳，其中一下級軍官告記者，前方無問題，我們正在增援。該軍官之熊度甚樂觀。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江廿一日電〕此間雖整日隆隆炮聲，但人心尚安，市面交易如常。</p>
<h3>政府答覆中共電全文</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕政府廿一日致和平代表團轉告中共之電文如次：</p>
<p>即到，北平六國飯店政府和平商談代表團張首席代表治中並轉邵·章·李·劉諸代表均鑒，黃代表紹竑·屈顧問武返京，備述和談進行經過，並攜回中共代表團所提出之「國內和平協定」全文，得悉一二，今日國家殘破如此之甚，人民痛苦如此之深，在八年慘烈抗戰獲得光榮勝利之後，國際地位反一落千丈，此皆由於戰亂不已所致，但求能徹底消弭戰禍，實現真正和平，使人民獲得休養機會，國家進入建設途程，吾人自應不惜一切犧牲以促其成，庶幾毋背革命之初志，上可以對中華民族之列宗列祖，下可以交代後世子孫。政府方面自蔣總統之元旦文告倡導和平以迄宗仁。應欽等主政後之一切措施，無一非遵循全國人民渴望和平之意旨，以國家人民最高利益為前提，委曲求全，忍辱負重，開誠佈公，苦心謀和，蔣總統之毅然引退與宗仁前致毛澤東先生四月七日電，即在欲犧牲一己，以成全大局，耿耿此心，宜為全國同胞所共鑒，乃縱觀中共所提之協定全文，其基本精神所在，不啻為征服者對被征服者之處置，以解除兄弟閱墻之爭端者，竟甚於敵國受降之形式，且復限期答覆，形同最後通牒，則又視和談之開端為戰爭之前夕，政府方面縱令甘心屈辱予以簽署，唯恐由於此種狹隘與威壓作風之刺激士氣民心，同深悲憤，不特各項條款非政府之能力所能保證執行，而由此引起之惡劣影響與後果，亦絕非政府能力所能挽救，良以此種協定果一旦訂定，則給予人民者，將非正真之和平，而為更殘酷。更大規模之長期戰爭，迫切渴望和平之人民，亦必決不願政府接受此一名為「和平」，實為「戰爭」之協定，馴致全國人民軍罹浩劫，登徒顯背謀和之初衷，抑必造成仇仇相報，永遠砍殺之悲慘局面，原文前言全屬對政府及中國國民黨詆毀譴責之詞，等於對罪犯之判決，何能稱為和平協定。即以條文內改編軍隊一項而論，雙方軍隊罷戰言和，自應同時改編，以實現軍隊國家化之原則，而該項協定規定政府所屬的一切武裝力量，包括一切陸軍·海軍·空軍·總兵部隊，交通警察部隊，地方部隊，一切軍事機關，學校，工廠及後方勤務機構等，均應編為「人民解放軍」，政府一切軍事設備及一切軍用物資，亦應移交「人民解放軍」接收，所謂「民主原則」，竟成共軍獨佔之制度。</p>
<p>關於整編程序，規定為集中整理與分區改編兩階段，所謂集中整理，即是由共方所控制之整編委員會命令國軍將防區與倉庫物資等先行移交「人民解放軍」接收，再開赴共軍認為適當之地點集中，以便分區改編，成為「人民解放軍」，如此改編工作完成之日，即國軍全被消減之時。</p>
<p>在政治方面，聯合政府成立之前，政府雖被允許暫時行使職權，實際上是奉共軍總部之命令辦事，其主要任務為協助共軍「辦理各地的接收和移交事項」，中共不但要接收政府的軍隊和全國政權，而且要透過軍事管制委員會之恐怖統制，形成以「接受地方的一切權利及國家產業財富」。</p>
<p>關於決定國家人民命運之政治協商會議問題，依照協定條文第廿三款「在南京國民政府代表團簽字於國內和平協定，並由南京國民政府付諸實施後，中國共產黨代表團願意負責向新的政治協商會議的籌備委員會提議，南京國民政府得派遣愛國分子若幹人為代表，出息新的政治協商會議，在取得新的政治協商會議籌備委員會批准後，南京國民政府的代表即可出席新的政治協商會議」，質言之，政府參加政協，須俟中共考察政府執行「和平協定」之成績，認為滿意，始允負責提議，以待「批准」。又照協定政府即獲「批准」參加政協，而能否參加聯合政府，仍須待共黨之提議，而且政府參加政協及聯合政府之人數及人選，均須聽命決定，上述云云，不過略舉數項，以為例證，實則該項協定全文均充滿決以中共武力控制全國之意味，一則曰「人民解放軍」開進，再則曰「人民解放軍」接收，所謂和平協定，實際為欲政府承認中共以武力征服全中國政府之軍隊，固等於全部繳械投降，即全國各城市鄉村之社會組織與人民生活方式，亦將依中共之意旨而徹底改變，如此勢必激起軍民之憤怒，若中共部隊向各地開進，中共人員向各地滲透，其必然遭遇軍民抗拒，殆為不可避免之事實，結果戰火與屠殺即將遍及全國之每一城市與鄉村，人民之痛苦愈益加深，國家之損失愈益增重，勢所必然，無待深論，事果演變不幸至此，則謀和適以製造亂源，弭戰反而擴展戰禍，豈忠於謀國愛護人民者所宜出此，所忍出此。總之，吾人今日如真能體認全國人民渴望和平，共同具有謀和之誠意，則必須泯除一切敵對與報復之心裡，根據事實，適應環境，共策合理有效之方法，以達到徹底消弭戰爭，獲致真正永久和平之目的，因之，政府除對中共此次所提出之國內和平協定表示上述原則上之意見外，仍希望中共方面確定人民利益高於一切之原則，對此項協定之基本精神與內容重新予以考慮。至於自今年元旦以來，政府軍隊每遇共軍進攻，均盡可能極力退讓，事實俱在，有目共睹，然中共方面不但未能停止進攻，且自四月一日政府和談代表抵達北平以後，若干地方之攻勢較前愈趨猛烈，殊堪遺憾，茲為培育祥和空氣，極盼能即日成立臨時停戰協定，藉以表示雙方謀取真正和平之決心與誠意，俾和談得以順利進行，特電佈達，希即將上述各項意見轉達中共方面，幷復為盼，李宗仁·何應欽·四月廿日。（中常會聲明全文刊第五版）</p>

<p>〔又電〕據悉：陳毅之第二世三軍已竄至泰與東南之天星橋有偷渡長江企圖。</p>
<h3>共軍對漢口外圍　可能展開新攻勢　黃陂東南昨一度劇戰</h3>
<p>〔本報橫店廿一日電〕軍息：鄂東共軍陳　部十三軍三千餘人　黃陂以北之林彪部四十三軍二千餘人，廿一日拂　分股由宋埠黃安長軒巔向黃陂東南柳子港八里店國軍陣地進犯，經國軍會合地方團隊奮勇應戰，激戰三小時後，共軍不支，旋向黃陂東北退去。據軍方判斷，該線共軍集結竣事後，可能於日內對漢口外圍展開新攻勢。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿一日電〕據李品仙氏今日在政委會對僚　宣稱：武漢外圍共軍正向東　動，短期內華中不致有大戰門。</p>
<h3>太原已進入巷戰　守軍繼續苦門中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕週來共軍所發動對太原城攻勢，據軍方估計其傷亡已達五萬餘人，國軍傷亡亦在二萬以上，廿一日傍晚雖已進入巷戰，但守軍仍在王靖國等將軍窄領下，繼續苦戰中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕太原戰事，廿一日晚六時在城北方面，共軍已滲入城郊之永與堡，上北關，城東至臥虎山，城東南雙塔寺，城西汾橋等處，共軍廿餘萬，在聶榮璨，徐向前率領下，廿日晚起復作面的攻擊，城外多數　堡及工事俱被夷為平地，城內主要建築物亦大部被炮轟毀，迄廿一日晚六時，共軍復自多處在炮火掩護下，利用雲梯爬城，同時若干被炮火轟毀之城牆缺口亦被攻入，壯烈的巷戰已正式展開</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕軍息：太原國軍第六十一軍軍長趙息，率部在井城西南南凍義井溝一帶，與五倍之共軍血戰三　夜，共軍傷亡過半，總以眾寡　殊，趙軍長壯烈殉職。</p>
<h3>美海軍陸戰隊　一部由京撤滬</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿一日電〕美大使館原有海軍陸戰士兵四十三名守衛，除留六名外，餘均於廿一日　奉令乘飛機撤滬，以免共軍攻佔南京時發生意外。</p>
<h3>和平談判終告破裂　政府各機關遷穂　首都昨起開始緊急疏散</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕政府為應付和談破裂後之局勢，廿一日晨九時由行政，立法，監察三院正副院長及秘書長舉行聯席會議，何應欽，于右任，童冠賢等均出席，李代總統亦參加，與會者咸以和談破裂，首都將受炮火威脅，政府勢須遷往廣州，當決定即日起緊急疏散，行政院除國防部暫遷上海外，其餘各部會均遷往廣州，立法院亦決定遷穂，除立委依其志願分往台灣，桂林，廣州外，秘書處職員均在穂集中，復會日期由院長決定後，再行通知。監察院亦遷廣州。至總統府則準備先遷至上海，再向廣州移動，所有各院部會職員均分三種辦法處理：（一）願留南京者，每人發疏散費伍佰萬元；（二）自動向指定地點疏散者，交通工具自籌，每人發疏散費叁佰萬元；（三）隨政府遷移者，交通工具統籌辦理，每人發疏散費五十萬元，疏散工作即日開始，希望於三五日內辦理完畢，至十一時散會。</p>

<p>〔中共社南京廿一日電〕政府發言人頃對中共提出之所謂「國內和平協定」作如下的初步評論；中共提出的所謂「國內和平協定」，根本不是和平協定，而是一部擴大戰亂，殘害人民，毀滅家園民族的協定，完全是以戰勝國對戰敗國的招降書。在「協定」前言中首先就將戰爭的全部責任加之於政府頭上，硬說政府違反了三民主義的革命立場違反了全國人民的意志，把五十年來的革命，八年的抗戰歷史一筆勾銷，將革命先烈全國英勇愛國軍民的人格完全污蔑，這些連所謂「八項原則」也遠遠的超過，尤其怪誕的，政府不過同意以八項原則為談判基礎，前言上竟誣賴我們已承認八項基本條件，總之，整個協定沒有一個字像和平協定，現在把所謂「國內和平協定」加以很公平的分析：</p>
<p>（一）就共方所提原案及修正案的精神而言，實與日本戰敗後與同盟國所簽訂之降書及傅作義將軍與共黨所簽訂之所謂北平局部和平協定如出一轍。</p>

<h3>朱毛擴大戰禍！</h3>
<p>中國共產黨電台昨日廣播，已由毛澤東朱德下令前線共軍，進攻國軍。這是它拒絕政府前天要求它重行考慮所提條件的答複。共軍確已展開更大規模的戰亂，政府也是已被迫而應戰了。</p>
<p>政府對於中共所提「和平協定」的苛刻條件，前天雖訓令和談代表未便接受。但仍希望中共能以民族利益為重，再行考慮他們所提出的苛刻條件，庶使和談不致破裂·同時，國民黨中常會也發表聲明，除了拒不接受中共所指的內戰責任而外，並表示竭誠謀和，仍盼望中共臨崖勒馬，立即分佈發停戰命令，使全國人民迫切期望的北平和談不致中斷。政府和國民黨的竭誠謀和，在老百性看來，可以說萬分誠摯了，明知時局已到千鈞一發的最後關頭，和平前途瀕於絕望，但仍對中共寄以一線希望，並時時刻刻等待中共的答覆，以冀「扳轉大局」。</p>
<p>但在中共方面呢，「和平協定」的苛刻及其氣焰之高，姑置勿論；即以其對於和談的態度而言，自始至終，絲毫沒有誠意，北平和談的終歸於破裂，早在我們意之中；但誰也沒有料到中共，竟會如此膽大妄為，冒天下之大不韙，一而再的甘為戎首。在和談進行的過程中，它不僅將其在東北和華北的軍隊源源南下，陳兵江邊，企圖以威脅的手段，加強其在和談中的地位，迫令政府和談代表和它盯城下之盟；而且零星戰火，始終沒有停止過·這個樣子的和談，邊談邊打，真是曠古所未謀以增加和談的困難，也就只好忍氣吞聲，靜待其演變了·時至今日，中共好戰的嘴臉，實已暴露無邊，中共對於政府「重行考慮」的要求，不僅置之不理，而且已以渡江攻勢代替了答覆·朱毛昨天向共軍發布總攻擊令，更顯然的證明了戰爭責任之應誰屬。</p>
<p>中共迷信武力萬能的心理，既已暴露無遺；此後全國人民自不應再懷任何幻想，戰爭的責任問題，已是一個黑白，分得清清楚楚，一目瞭然，再也不會含糊的了·在政協時代，人民受了中共及其同路人的宜傳，或許有不明事理的人，曾受其迷惑，對於責任問題搞不清；但現在鐵一般的事實放在我們的眼前。誰是好戰？誰是迷信武力？誰是內戰的戎首？大家難道還會分不清楚？今日政府既然被迫應戰，全國人民自應以全力支援政府應戰到底，中共好戰者一日不能實現。要和平，唯有奮起打倒這個迷信武力的好戰者。在未達到這個目的之前，即使遭遇任何艱苦，任何困難，都只能咬緊牙關，忍耐苦撐，再也不能中途求和，否則就是投降，必陷國家於萬刦不復之境，而人民更將受盡鐵幕以內的苦楚。</p>
<p>中共在軍事上的發展，可以說完全是偶然的。它向全國人民所作的種種宣傳，祇能欺騙人民於一時，但終不能永久掩飾其關點。過去中共控制的區域，大半在究鄉僻壤，其所推行的一切政策，不易透過它的鐵幕，使外人都能看清楚它的真面目。但現在已由鄉村移到都市，北平天津雖也懸起它的「竹簾」，可是它的弱點卻已從漏洞中透露出來了。不要說人民生活不自由，即以一切社會文化的設施而言，都要退後五十年。我們曾和香港商人受了中共的欺騙北上交換物資歸來的談談，他竟稱，「中共成功，是無天理」·這雖是憤慨之言，但可謂對中共最恰當的批判·所以，我們認為中共並不真正可怕，最可怕的，倒是政府和國民黨的不知奮發振作·今後政府受了這次教訓，如能痛下決心，革新更生，則對共的戰爭，是為人民爭自由而戰，為國家爭獨立而戰，其必能獲得最後勝利，可操左券的·</p>
<p>要之，中共既已下令總攻，政府自然祇有被迫應戰，而且戰火勢必在長江兩岸逐漸熾烈，地方糜爛亦將不能避免。此固國家的不幸，但人民須知，戰禍當前，唯有抱必死之決心，才能從死裏求生。如若仍抱著苟安躲避的心理，則必致自取滅亡的惡果。我們希望全國不願受人奴役的同胞，大家都本著「有力出力，有錢出錢」的原則，一心一德，合力支援政府這次被迫應戰，直到好戰者也願和平為止·人民的力量是偉大的，不可抗禦的·政府既為自由而戰，為獨立而戰，為和平而戰，而擁有人民的支援，最終的結果，必能替全國人民爭得真正的自由與和平·</p>
<h3>長江北岸共軍砲火猛烈　英兩巨艦續被擊損　「倫敦」及「黑天鵝」兩艦均已折返上海　共死十五人傷二十五人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據英國新聞處廿二日晨駛往出事地點援救「紫水晶」號之英重級巡洋艦「倫敦」號及「黑天鵝」號，於駛抵江陰附近之Bateas　Point及Beaber　Island時，又遭北岸砲火轟擊，兩艦略受損傷，當時曾予還擊，惟為恐引起嚴重沖突，決定暫時放棄援救「紫水晶」之企圖，即行折回，駛返上海，停泊藍煙囪碼頭。英飛「聖德蘭」號，昨午戰藥品自香港抵滬後，下午四時自龍華機場飛往出事地點，機上戰醫生兩人及藥品若幹。聞「紫水晶」號擱淺處附近之Shayao河畔，有廣場可供飛船降落，由該處可至艦上施救。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿一日電〕英萬噸巡洋艦倫敦號，今日電告南京，謂該艦企圖救援英艦紫水晶號時，亦遭北岸共軍砲擊中彈受損，已駛回江陰。倫敦號電報並曰：共軍砲火熾烈，不允任何船舶駛近紫水晶號救援艦上傷者。</p>
<p>〔路透社本市訊〕此間英海軍當局頃發表：英巡洋艦倫敦號，驅逐艦黑天鵝號，今晚六時已駛回上海，經查明倫敦號死者十五人，傷廿人，黑天鵝號傷五人，無死者·美海軍全力協助已將重傷者移入此間美海軍醫院，下午離滬之又特蘭式飛船，已將軍醫一名，攜嗎啡等藥品，降落登紫水晶號艦，並載該艦軍官一名返滬。</p>
<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕英總領事館發表施諦文大使之聲明：渠未向中共抗議，但會囑北平英領事館「以各種可能方法向中共最高當局告知紫水晶號與夥伴號被轟擊事，並請彼等立即訓令沿江軍事司令停止射擊」。聲明繼稱：施氏已知平領館接獲命令，並謂鑒於最近發展，「沿江部隊顯未接獲獲停轟之令，因此可假定與北平當局之接觸迄今未曾成功，京大使館之尤特先生曾自請試與浦口迤北共軍司令接洽，希望能獲得必要之停轟令·如無此令，欲抵達紫水晶號上受傷人員及予以適當醫治與救濟等，目前顯無可能」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿一日電〕英外交部發言人今日稱：英艦獲得中國政府許可，有權駐入中國內河，一如中國兵艦獲得英國准許，可駛入大姆士河。某記者問共軍當局是否知悉英艦開往長江上遊？發言人稱：共方早知此事。</p>
<p>〔路透社渥太華廿日電〕加拿大海軍總部發言人今日聲稱：皇家海軍有足量軍艦，以應付南京上海區的任何事變。渠又謂：現泊香港之加拿大驅逐艦新月號，預料不致被牽涉，因該艦主要任務在保護香港區之英僑，渠亦不以為有任何加拿大人民受長江戰事之危險。</p>
<p>〔中央社香港廿一日電〕此間英遠東艦隊總司令發表聲明稱：昨廿日在長江被共軍砲轟，並遭擱淺之砲艦紫水晶號，今日得重浮水面，刻正拋錨，暫泊原處。</p>
<p>〔合衆社香港廿一日電〕英海軍廿一在此宣佈：英驅逐艦「新月」號赴滬加強該處之海軍實力，重巡洋艦［貝爾法斯特」亦有派往之可能。</p>
<p>〔合衆社英吉利格林威治廿日電〕英海軍總司令弗萊塞勳爵今日對英艦被轟事件聲稱：「最重要之事厥為思忖如何處置，我人之原則為除能予以協助外，一切留待常地人員處理，並通知外交部，首相及國防大臣，然後等待發展」。</p>
<p>紫水晶號自行浮起</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿一日電〕英艦紫水晶今晨向此間英海軍當局報告，該艦已自行設法浮起，離擱淺之處下駛三哩拋錨暫泊。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿一日電〕大港來電稱：救護人員四名，內醫師兩名，已登英艦紫水晶號上救護傷者。同時有飛機一架於下午五時半飛臨該艦投下藥品，此岸砲火又起，但該艦已上駛至大路鎮，登艦者為英使館武官杜利中校，英助理海軍武官卡倫斯中校，美海軍外簡直醫師派卡及另一醫師</p>
<p>郁特往共區洽停射</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿一日電〕英大使館一等秘書郁特，已自願自京渡江往浦口，與共軍當局接洽停止射擊，以便救援紫水晶號上負傷卅六小時不獲醫治之英海軍人員廿六名。郁氏已於廿一日下午六時左右，渡江赴浦口，前往共區接洽，渠隨身僅攜牙刷一柄，銀元五十枚，預定於廿二日拂曉入共軍界線，渠身穿海軍制服。</p>
<p>英官方未表示意見</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿一日電〕紐約時報倫敦記者稱：倫敦英國官方為長江中央艦被砲擊事，在績獲詳細報前，不願表示意見。英外部拒絕發表聲明，僅證實施諦文大使已有初步報告送達倫敦。英官方同時則透露，自去年十月起，英艦即經常泊在京滬區，以便於必要時撤退英官員及居民，紫水晶號此次自滬駛京，係擔任運送供應品至南京英使館之和平使命，英方事先已通知中國國共兩方，在英國生命財產受中國內戰危險期間，英艦將在長江擔任此等使命。</p>
<p>英美報告評論一斑</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿一日電〕倫敦自由黨新聞記者報廿一日宣稱：英國人欲問二十日被共軍砲轟之英艦，為何於此時航行長江，並欲知我國軍艦，為何被牽涉於共軍之渡江攻勢？「紫水晶」號在此時開往南京，是否絕對必要？保守黨每日書報則稱：英軍艦有權在長江保護英國人之生命。英水兵向岸上還擊乃一可喜之事。亞洲人勿認為英國國旗及其所代表之一切，可任意安然侮辱。英艦之砲火，已對全亞洲發生警告。共產黨每日工人報稱：試問英軍為何駐在中國，無非欲壓迫貪污卑鄙之中國政府，及保護大企業之投資而已。英國所有陸軍及海軍艦只，應即於此時撤離中國</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿一日電〕前鋒講壇報廿一日社論稱：共軍砲轟長江英艦，定將化為一種「意外事件」，而不致引起英國幹涉中國內戰，一如美國之不干涉中國內戰·故短期之將來，不幸之中國祇有倚賴其人民本身。內戰倘若恢復，乃中國之悲劇，乃為整個西方世界之悲劇·（尚有消息刊第四版）</p>

<h3>政府發言人　評論中共條款　上接一版</h3>
<p>（二）前言的重點，在確定政府應負破壞停戰協定和政協決議，發動戰皺的全部責任，在確定政府政策及措施是違反三民主義的革命立場及違反全國人民意志的；在確定政府和國軍已處於戰敗者的地位；在確定毛澤東所提的「八項基礎條件已經南京國民政府所同意」因而這個「國內和平協定」的簽訂不過是政府履行八項和平條件必要的初步手續而已。</p>
<p>（三）第一條關於所謂「戰犯」問題，第一款第一項所說之「飜然悔悟」，「確有事實表現」，「有利於中國人民解放事業之推進」以及「有利於和平方法解決國內問題」，意在分化政府內部，誘惑政府文武官員個別投降，其「寬大」之範圍，僅限於確有其事實證明，效忠於共黨之投降份子。第一款第二項，意在說明凡立場堅定之政府官吏和國民黨員，均將被視為「怙惡不悛」阻礙共產黨政策之推進，而受其「從嚴懲辦」，且所謂「人民解放事業」，所謂「用和平方法解決國內問題」，並無明確範圍，任何人及任何問題均可包括在內。</p>
<p>（四）關於改編軍隊問題，第四條各款說明政府所屬的一切武裝力量，包括陸·海·空·憲·警·地方武力·軍事機關·學校·工廠及後勤機構，均應改變為共軍，而共軍並不在整編之列。所謂「依據民主原則」第八款第二項一二兩點都說明原來是「人民解放軍民主制度和編制」全國性的整編委員會，表面上是委員制，但共方之委員既為主任，其委員又佔多數，不論採取命令方式或表決方式，我方只有受其支配，絕難據理力爭，貫澈主張。條文中屢次提到共軍「到達和接收的地區」並說明共軍向政府現時所轄地區開進時，政府所屬武裝部隊不得抵抗，如有對改編計劃抗不執行的部隊政府還應當協助共軍強制執行也就是說政府應命令這一部份國軍與共軍合力去消滅那一部份國軍·共軍所要到達和接收的地區和時間，完全由共方所控制的整編委員會及其分會決定，因為政府所屬的一切軍事機關（從國防部直到聯勤總部所屬的機關學校工廠金庫等）一切軍事設備（軍港要塞空軍基地等）及一切軍事物資，都在共軍接收之列，所以共軍不但根據助定可以渡江，而且可以進軍到海南，臺灣及任何政府所管轄的地點，不受絲毫限制，許多人都很重視共軍和平渡江問題，其實如果政府接受了將國軍改編烘軍的條款，渡江是根本不成問題的。至於國軍整編的程序，第八款分為集中整理和分區改編的兩個階段，所謂集中整理，就是由共黨所控制的整編委員會命令國軍把防區和倉庫物資等，先實行和平移交給共軍接收，再開赴共軍認為適當的地點，集中起來，以便分區依照共軍的「民主制度」和「正規編制」改編成共軍的正規部隊，海空軍也根據同樣的原則改編，整編工作完成，國軍便完全被消滅了。</p>
<p>（五）關於和平協定簽字後，政府的任務和政府將來在新政治協商會議以及聯合政府中的地位，第八條各款也有明確的規定，在聯合政府成立之前政府機構可以暫時行使職權，它的職權是處理共軍軍事委員會所授意的事務，實際上就是奉共軍總部的命令，辦事主要的工作，是協助共軍辦理各地的接收和移交，在共軍尚未到達和接收的地區。各級政府應負責維持治安，保存財產，保護反政府的所謂「人民民主力量及其活動」以及共黨份子所操縱的「農民聚眾的組織及活動」，等到共軍接收工作完畢，聯合政府成立，我們的政府最後辦理本身的移交宣告結束，政府參加政協會議，需要等候共黨考察新政府執行「和平協定」的成績認為滿意以後，它才負責向新政協籌備會「提議」，允許政府派遣所謂「愛國份子」若干作代表，得到政協籌備會「批准」後，政府代表才能出席政協會議，這就是說政府是沒有資格參加政協籌備會的，政府有沒有資格參加政協，以及派那些人作代表參加政協，都必須先經過共黨的考核決定，所謂愛國份子，就是共黨所喜歡的人物，共黨最痛恨的所謂「反動份子」，是絕對不許可作政協代表的，政府代表即使被許可參加新政協會議，但政府是否能參加聯合政府，也需要共黨向新政協會議「提議」政府代表將來在新政協和聯合政府佔多少席位，均須由共黨決定，政府代表在會議中並不能取得平等發言表決的地位，如果共黨認為政府所表現的成績或對政府所派代表人選不滿意的話，它隨時都可以撤消允許參加聯合政府的提議。至於不經法定程序橫蠻的片面的廢除憲法，破壞法統，尤其人人所共知。把以上各點歸納起來，可知共黨所提的「國內和平協定」的簽訂，就是政府的無條件投降，就是三民主義革命立場的根本放棄，就是憲政民主政府和政府所屬全部陸海空力量的澈底毀滅，站在國家民族的觀點，更有絕大危險，而將全國置於共軍軍事管制之下，任何地區都要變成軍事管制的恐怖地界，全國人民自然絕對沒有方法可以接受。</p>

<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦二十一日電〕英王與英後已定於明日在白金漢宮招待各聯邦總理。瑪麗太後，以麗莎白公主，愛丁堡公爵，以及格勞斯特公爵暨夫人亦均將出席。</p>
<h3>蘇和平試探是否具誠意　視今後態度爲斷　西方反封鎖使東德經濟窒息</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十日電〕某有資格的官員二十日稱，美國政府尚未能決定傅布中的蘇聯「和平試探」是否具有誠意，抑係一種宣傳策略。渠在對記者約定勿公開其姓氏及所代表的部會後，即宣讀聲明，謹慎地分析喧囂中的「和平」報道。繼稱，政府對此等消息不擬否認，亦不擬證實，以「避免公眾誤會」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林二十日電〕美軍總督克萊今日宣稱，蘇聯建議解除柏林封鎖，予未有所聞。蘇聯方面亦守口如瓶，惟某小國領事館員自云曾聞此說。蘇聯佔區經濟窒息，製造所需之鋼鐵，電料及精密儀器等，均遭西方國家禁運。近自蘇區逃出之德國鐵路行政人員告西柏林市府稱，予不住東柏林市府能再維持一月。鐵路車輛窳敗，行車誤時，應受修理之機車，不得不加倍工作。東部德警獲蘇聯准許，今日對邊界監視已略為鬆弛，惟柏林共黨警察則將大部份街道封鎖。美軍對佔領區內之美僑及盟國人民施行新關稅管制，以防走私至奧地利及捷克。近據美官方估計，私運過西德邊境之貨物，一年約二億美元。</p>
<p>解放封鎖　蘇附條件</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林二十日電〕德方某要人今日稱，蘇聯擬向美英提出解放柏林封鎖計劃，惟須以禁止德國參加大西洋條約，美英法軍隊退至萊茵河岸，由美英法蘇四國共同設立德國中央政府為條件。蘇聯方面除解放柏林封鎖外，亦允將駐軍撤退至奧特河岸。美英當局對於此說，既不證實亦不否認。</p>
<p>德人亟盼　恢復貿易</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿一日電〕蘇佔區德國經濟委員會主席雷亭裏許今日建議，如西方國家結束渠等對蘇佔區的反封鎖，則蘇聯應解放柏林封鎖。雷亭裏許在單獨接見共黨機關報「新德意志」報記者昌，以問答的方式提出上項建議。渠稱，「如西方國家取消渠等對佔區間貿易的禁令，則東西佔區間的物資交換可能恢復」。渠證實東西佔區間的德官員曾討論取消貿易限制問題，但稱，此係西方佔區德國官員所主動者，談判係在數週前舉行。渠並否認渠曾對渠之經濟委員會稱，為防止蘇佔區的經濟崩潰，柏林封鎖必須解除。</p>
<p>按美英佔領當局曾在二十日宣佈東區經濟委員會曾對西區德國貿易官員提出非正式函件，建議取消貿易壁壘·同時蘇聯佔領軍機關報「每日評論報」稱，「柏林西區的許多德人均表示願意與蘇佔區通商」。</p>
<h3>克萊中「敵」機槍　美軍演習逼真　雷達站失效「敵」軍深入</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐倫堡廿日電〕德境美軍演習中，「敵」軍今日攻入美軍區更深，美兵「受傷」逾千人。德境美空軍雷達警報站再度失效，至「敵」機得肆意意掃射「敗逃」之美軍，受傷者中有十人「假定已喪生」·據「敵」方空軍司令部宣佈，美軍總督兼德境美軍司令克萊乘飛機抵此視察，下機時被「敵」機關槍「擊中」，胡　納中將在機場迎接克萊亦受「傷」·後退之美軍工兵將一切孩務「炸毀」，僅留魯特威格運河上三座橋樑。該運河以西，美步兵與裝甲軍主力沿九十五哩長之陣線佈陣，作最後之決死戰·美穿軍將依照預定之演習計劃，爭取已失去之制空權。</p>

<h3>艾契遜宣佈　美決繼續援韓　美軍撤退前兼武裝韓警察</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處華盛頓廿日電〕國務卿艾契遜今日在記者會中稱：一九五〇年經濟援韓計劃目前正在草擬中，艾契遜此言係答覆記者提出之問題。</p>

<h3>德人應有政治自決權利　不願受盟國干涉　社億黨參加制憲提六項條件</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社漢諾威二十日電〕社會民主黨大會今日在此間開會時，拒絕同意任何西德憲法，除非對於該黨為使德人獲得自主權利而確定之六項條件加以考慮。大會認為六項條件，為使社民黨繼續參加波恩制憲議會之「最後可能」。六項條件為（一）德人有自決之權利，不受外國干涉；（二）將「基本法」（憲法）減至最低限度；（三）削減第二院之權力；（四）在各方面保持經濟與政治統一尤其在立法方面；（五）解決財政問題，使議會能完成其任務；（六）聯邦各部分中實施單一之社會法境內外。社民黨草擬之臨時憲法，經該黨大會通過後，將於數日內公布。大會並通過一項決議，追述德國各黨對於憲法而獲致協議，然由於外國之干涉後，基督教民主黨之態度已被破壞。決議中認為盟國之幹涉，已「危害民主之觀」念。又稱德國人民政治願望之自由表達而非盟國之指令，始能制止國家主義或共黨主義力量之崛起。巴威略邦總理基督教民主黨之伊哈爾，今晚指漢諾威之決定「等於最後通諜」並將增加波恩制憲議會內部之裂痕，制憲議會主席及基督教民主黨首領亞登諾亦強調波恩制憲會議情況之嚴重性。</p>

<h3>邱吉爾力主統一歐洲經濟　免致淪為乞丐或奴隸</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕邱吉爾今日向廿一國歐洲運動經濟會議致辭，再度發出團結歐洲的號召。他說，歐洲將不得不沉沒或共同泅泳之時我們如不願做乞丐或奴隸，為本國及歐洲著想，必須思想計劃及努力。印翁稱，歐洲具有二十幾個國家及其經濟單位的舊制度，為一愚蠢的制度。歐洲若依傳統方式企圖復興，決無成功之望。兩次世界大戰在卅五年內造成的進化，已抵過平均一百內的進化。就十九世紀末期的發展觀歐洲除非牢固並統一其經濟力量，必致陷入經濟困難。我們必須有如一九一四年以前可以自由兌換的貨幣，可以不需要護照前往任何處所，亦無不能兌換的金錢。這似乎是烏托邦的世界，但到了那時，必將不足為奇。總之，這是我們必須努力皺取的目標。法總工會長茹霍稱，歐洲運動社會及商務委員會，應與國際勞工局合作，準備使歐洲勞工立法趨於有效的統一。茹氏並主張集體進行重要工業，並開始興築水閘，地道，生活，原子發電廠，使失業員獲得歸宿。此次會議，共分貨幣，社會與商業，基本工業，農業，海外土地及憲政等六個委員會，將於廿一日起開始分別討論。</p>

<h3>義大利戰前非洲殖民地　應由聯合國托管　我國提出計劃與蘇相似</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖二十日電〕中國二十日提出處置前義殖民地之計劃，在若幹方面與蘇聯計劃相似。中國代表願維鈞在聯大發政委會中稱，許多代表雖主張對每一有關領土，由一單獨國家托管，但對細則甚少協議。渠建議由聯合國托管義殖民地，僅東伊裏特利亞之一部除外。渠稱，該處應合併於阿比西尼亞，因其居民為阿比西尼亞種族及文化。　氏建議：（一）聯合國托管西倫尼加·特裏波利坦尼亞·伊裏特利亞的大部分馬索裏蘭等地。（二）托管理事會為每一地區指定行政官提交聯大考慮，並成立由五人至七人所組成之諮議委員會以協助行政官·（三）如裏比亞立即獨立被認為不可實行，則對裏比亞之托管應於五年後終結，並即准予獨立。索馬裏蘭於十年後獨立，或按照該地居民自由意志之其他辦法。政委會已結束對義殖民地問題之初步討論，但關於處置義殖民地之矛盾建議極多，故本屆大會中恐不易解決。</p>

<h3>國貨廠商聯會電代總統　請發行十足準備銀元券</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕英艦「紫水晶」及「夥伴」號在長江遭共軍砲擊，死傷士兵，昨有兩批運滬。上午「夥伴」號來死者十人，重傷十五人，輕傷十二人。下午京滬線第五次車運來重傷一人，輕傷四人，均車送中正西路宏恩醫院醫治。「紫水晶」號上未受傷之官兵五十餘人，亦乘該次車來滬。渠等情形甚為狼狽，大都僅穿汗衣短褲，外披國軍士兵之黃色棉軍服。</p>
<p>「夥伴」號與共軍岸上砲隊作戰兩小時，外身並無損傷，內部則零亂不堪。共軍砲火係發自一〇五釐口徑之大砲，及機關槍與平射砲。據艦上人員稱：渠等還擊三百餘發，相信會擊毀共軍砲火八處並擊斃共軍約六十人。其後艦上測距室被毀，引擎間亦中彈，駕駛盤損壞，舵手中彈而死，乃於萬分困難中設法下駛至江陰拋錨，然後繼駛上海。該艦原有英旗七面，除非共軍不識英旗，否則不會不知為英國兵艦也·</p>
<p>死亡士兵遺體今安葬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日「夥伴」號運滬之死亡士兵十人之遺體，經送國際殯儀館成殮，定於今日下午二時半葬於虹橋公墓，並將於江西路聖三一教堂舉行紀念禱告。</p>

<p>滬英海軍當局發表文告</p>
<p>〔英國新聞處本市訊〕駐滬英海軍當局（廿一日）七時發表下列文告：英艦紫水晶號於昨晚（廿日）十時，再以無線電報告稱，該艦人員正盡全力修理各受創處，使能重新浮起。艦員中有六十人，據稱已離艦前往附近一大鎮，因彼等於夜間不克道經地雷佈區而歸艦，其中四人係愛傷者。按共軍以中型砲火連續向該艦射擊，直至中午，而零星砲火則至下午猶未停止，結果艦員中死約十七人，受傷者約二十人，是故艦員大部皆被迫臨時離艦，以避免更大死傷，然至傍晚時刻，其能歸艦者則皆已回至艦上。今晨六時十五分又接報告稱，紫水晶號於昨晚深夜即自行修理，現已重新浮起。又據報告，夥伴號於昨晨十一時五十分自南京啟碇後，即以全速率向下遊開駛，直至瞭見紫水晶號亦發出信號通知夥伴號掉頭退去，以避砲火。但夥伴號則以為繼續全速前進為安，俟砲火消歇，已在下游距紫水晶二哩地點，始折回復向紫水晶號駛去，俾趨接近拉牽，但迫於猛烈砲火，祇得撤退，仍向下游駛去，途中又遭噴水洲（學文洲）之活躍砲火，該艦大部份傷亡，係於此時蒙受，舵手殞命，駕駛輪機亦一時不能運用，艦員死者共九人，重傷者三人。該艦曾以全部武器有效應戰。此外並已設法由王家空軍聖德閘水上飛機自香港巡送醫藥援助品前往。</p>
<p>紫水晶　軍官談經過</p>
<p>〔路透社本市訊〕英艦紫水晶號之英水手五十九名，華籍夥夫四名，已於今日下午四時自常州搭炎車抵達上海，彼等離艦後，在砲火下游泳抵岸上，然後步行七哩抵達常州，國軍士兵沿途竭力予彼等以照料。抵滬諸人，多披黃布棉軍服，係國軍撥與彼等者，各人均極疲憊，有禦繃帶者，有負傷用擔架抬下火車者，有跣足者，有穿拖鞋者，極為狼狽。英美海軍人員在車站照料，下車後，即赴英領署暫憇，後又移往滬英僑寓所暫住。據其中之領導軍官希斯告記者，艦員係於昨晨八時卅分奉今準備應付，九時許有炮彈數權掠過，但未觸及艦身，但岸上大砲發砲不已，掌舵室及艦塔首被擊中，艦長等數人中彈，以後形勢混亂，艦身不久即擱淺，駕駛舵亦失靈，時岸上仍發砲不已，艦員決定如共方人員企圖登艦，當以步槍抵抗，乃將步槍分發各員，但紫水晶號又告被中砲彈，抵抗之計劃卒放棄，已受傷之羅勃森艦長，於艦身一角中彈後，乃下令扯起白旗兩面，不料共方似患色盲，仍繼續發砲不已，乃放下扶梯，希斯等一行，游泳二百碼抵達島上，共軍猶不放鬆，用機關槍向水中掃射，續有死傷。島上華人指示未設地雷之途徑，步行半小時後，遇國軍放信號槍，乃由艦上華人夥夫泅至對岸國軍陣地，派小船接諸人過江，由一軍官領導步行七哩，再換卡車三輛，於今晨五時抵常州，抵常後，國軍少校一名親為照料，並代向路局接洽掛專車一節來滬。</p>

<h3>交際花失手斃養女　钜鹿路箱屍案破獲</h3>
<p>徐琴舫被捕後供出肇事經過</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月九日晨，钜鹿路五五六弄口，發現被棄黃色舊皮箱一支，後經崗警帶回該管靜安寺分局啟箱檢視，則赫然為一約四齡之啟遍體鱗傷女孩死屍，週圍裹以棉絮，顯係生前遭受毒打致死後拋棄者，當由五分局長據倩報告總局刑事處，由處長鄭庭顯飭派第五科科長姚愷如·股長吳亮潛·級長孫世麟等會同該分局司法股人員著手偵查，已予破案。凶犯為一著名之交際花，名徐琴舫，業於昨晨六時拘獲。缘此案發生後，警局人員在現場偵察結果，斷定</p>
<p>發生地點　並不過遠，故即以按戶調查戶口著手，旋在襄陽北路六弄七號發現戶主徐琴舫涉嫌甚大，蓋徐之戶口為二女一孩，一為其女名文華，一為其女傭王媽。當調查時，女孩未見，同時徐神色呈現極度慌張，惟警員以無充分證據，當時仍不動聲色，惟事後即派員秘密注意行動，迨至翌日，徐即外出不歸，一切家事另托一女友前往照顧，至第三日，徐獨自赴閘北中興路會文永壽庵超度亡魂，此後每隔三日或五日，返家稍坐即去，此時警員就鄰居處已探得其女失蹤之時日，即為本案發生前一夜，加以徐恍惚之行蹤，更啟疑實，最後乃設法與其女傭王媽接觸，經盤訊後，始</p>
<p>吐露真相　案情得以大白。查死孩實係徐之螟蛉女，取名文華，現年四歲，當領養時（年僅週歲），徐愛之如已出，惟近年來因境況欠佳，以致性情暴躁，動辄將女歐擊，尤以本月六日晨，因女便溺曾遭毒打，詎八日晨女又便溺如故，致於痛歐後，將女自床上摔下，因傷在要害，竟至毙命。事後徐畏罪，即將屍體盛至舊上箱內，並裹以棉絮，囑渠於深夜攜出拋棄郊外，迨行至中途，恐遭注意盤詰，即棄於钜鹿路五五六弄口，警局據情後，即密派偵緝人員伺候該宅四週，直於昨晨六時，徐又翩然而返，警員等乃上前加以</p>
<p>拘捕帶局，　一訊即服。徐現年三十歲，寧波人，其供詞中曾述及其身世，謂自幼未受教育，十四歲時隨父赴華北經商，至十八歲，與天津某富商結婚，未幾因意見不合，即告仳離，廿四歲時支身來滬，開室金門飯店，一度下海伴舞，其後又以交際花姿態出入各交際場所，得識本市某聞人，相與繾綣，最初賃屋同居於復興中路辣斐坊，其後即返居襄陽北路六弄七號，惟最近某聞人日久生厭，裹足不往，生計頓感恐慌，衷心　　，性情轉趨暴躁，致失手釀成此一命案云。</p>

<h3>常州南外古墓　清理第一聲　明器儲藏室發現</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　李天行</p>
<p>〔本報武進廿日訊〕本邑南門外青龍橋惲家教，因構築防禦工事，無意中發見了一個古墓。磚頭花紋奇古，墓門建築特巽，因之轟傳遐迩，京滬一帶考古家，紛紛來常察看，咸認為有開掘的價值。經地方人士唱和建議，由縣府邀集各界組織開掘委會·諸事準備，正擬開掘的時候，忽奉江蘇省府歙歙命令，謂依據古墓發掘條例，應由省市以上學術機關主持，地方不得隨意開掘。一面省復電請上海同濟學院暨上海市博物館主持其事。旋經同濟學院蔣大沂先生，市博物館長楊寬正·中央博物館曾昭　等來常興地方人士，協商決定以古墓業經構築防禦工事而露出地面，是項工作，已不是開掘，而是清理與收拾。於是開掘委員會，就更名為古代殘墓清理保管委員會。委員由縣聘定學術界知名之士如蔣維裔等以及專家蔣大沂楊寬正會昭燏楊有潤等外，一部份均為地方人士。並推由同濟大學暨上海市博物館負責呈請備案以及田野清理，學術研究等工作。地方上負責維持秩序，供應事物等工作。並訂定古物出土，悉歸地方負責保管。議既定，於是工作逐漸展開。</p>
<p>凡事一着實際，就處處感到麻煩了諸如田野工作者的塲所，住處，伙食，以及工作，隨在都經過了一番張羅和佈置。最後，青龍橋小學校長王佩琴幫了忙。讓出禮堂，做工作場所。鄉長品富昌幫了忙，找工人，借工具，以及搭籬笆。七七八八，著實煩了一陣子的準備工作。</p>
<p>十三日，楊有潤先生清晨就趕到青龍橋，十四日同濟蔣大沂率同了兩位技術人員也趕到，彼此興致沖沖，十五日正式開始清理。先著工友將古墓前的積土撤清在一鋤頭，一鋤頭，一擔泥，一擔泥的進行下，第一天把一個已被鄉民因取磚而發掘淨盡的墓基重新找出。長，闊，高等找到眉目。十七日下了一天春雨，就延滯了工作進程。十八九日兩天，在挖到這個古墓底地。在瑣碎的泥堆下，得了破爛的古錢。和粉碎的鐵器，古錢大部是五銖錢。銅綠斑剝，有些還十分完整，有些是支離破碎，很難檢收。鐵器也剩著爛柯的樣兒恐無可磨洗，這些現在都被田野工作者，一一收拾保存起來了！這個古墓的周圍，現已用竹籬笆統圍起來，並由城防部張貼佈告，在工作期間，一律停止參觀。至於墓內工作，迄筆者為文正，尚未進行，大約還須在一二日後，可以登堂入室。</p>
<p>當田野工作展開之際，蔣大沂和楊有潤先生，在初發現古墓的北面約五六丈之遠。也就是惲家墩的正上面，在城防工事挖出一個深坑的北面壁間，露出砌磚一義蔣·楊兩先生認為這裏定有苗頭。於是也分一二個工人，在這裏發掘。大約開進去不到五六尺遠，就另發見了一個坑，坑內滿滿的擠著一個瓶，一個瓶，大大小小，六七個瓶露面了！目的物加強工作興趣，六個瓶拿出來了，下面還有著瓶，七個八個，十餘個，……十九日連著開到深夜二時餘，開出了十餘個，但實藏了還是不少的瓶兒。並且已發現了一部份銅器，為了工作謹慎起見，暫時停手，仍舊用板門掩起，上面仍用泥封起。廿日清晨，在這地也打一個竹籬笆起來，定廿一日再細細清理。蔣楊兩先生以及地方人士，都十分興奮，原來又掘得了另一個古墓。</p>
<p>古墓坑內完全是儲滿了明器，根據漢魏晉的古墓常例；往往墓內另有一室，專儲器用。此室當為明器儲藏室無疑。墓的砌磚上，沒有花紋，與第一墓磚不同，由此亦可知，此必爲兩墓，不是一家。已出土的明器（廿日前）均爲陶器，一個頂大的高約一尺五六寸，闊一尺二三寸。</p>
<p>圖案式樣極優美，上半截單色淡黃油彩，黑　色綫條，瓶口描疊人字紋，細膩均勻。瓶頸一束，亦爲疊人字紋。瓶肩及身三道　弦綫紋。上兩空間帶狀中，描有飛鳥和鳴園案。古拙多趣。下半截色紫　，無油釉。瓶肩有兩　。虎蹄脚。甚精細。瓶口一面缺碎，內滿藏汚泥。（見圖）另爲一巨　形。高闊約一尺二三寸。取圓形味。上大半截均塗油釉，淡茶黃色。　以重疊橫綫，橫綫之間，竪以小組縱綫，上下錯縱，花紋亦古拙可愛。下半截無油釉，色如泥。此　完好無缺，　內都實泥土。另有小形　八九個。形狀與大　相近，只小了些。　身均有弦綫紋相間橫劃。一種色澤全　紅色，一種色爲　醬色。大小亦略有不同。（見圖）據非正式的說法，這類東西，總在六朝之間。出土的　，統拿到縣黨部，一一保管，留待一併細細研究，現在似已感到研究工作人員太少些</p>
<p>常州南外惲家墩已出土之明代陶器：（上）高約一尺五六寸，闊約一尺餘。（中）高闊約五寸餘。（下）高約一尺餘，闊九寸餘。（本報記者李天行繪製）</p>
<h3>川中重鎭　菸度糖城　簡陽</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　周學端</p>
<p>〔本報成都十七日航訊〕美菸是四川戰時新興特產，四川美菸之都簡陽，馳譽全國，早於河南許昌齊名。簡陽—左枕龍泉，右帶沱江，商務繁華，特產豐富，是四川今年新興的重要都市。春風淡蕩，記者特附一車之便，到這號稱集四川特產精華的川中重鎭，實地看看菸糖特產的生產運銷近况。</p>
<p>簡陽石橋繁榮一般</p>
<p>簡陽東距成都二百餘里，水道襟帶沱江，北通金堂，南接濾縣；陸路當成渝咽喉，西走雅安，東抵萬縣。出成都東站，越龍泉山，便到簡陽第一大鎮－－石橋；這是川中水陸總碼頭，川西南與川東北物資交流，均以此為轉運點·人煙稠密，市裏繁盛，教育發達，有中學廿一校，小學近百校。特增包括美菸，糖，監，棉花等，鎮上街路廣坦，建築整齊，舟車如雲，工廠林立，氣象不亞江南一大縣。石橋西行四十裏，抵簡陽城，簡陽是成都東面第一重門戶，成渝，濾遂（　）兩公路橫貫相交，城區雄偉壯麗，新舊工廠極多。全縣縱橫百餘平方公裏，人口數逾百萬，居民半是煙農蔗農，或糖廠監場工人，其餘多為菸廠商或經營貨品轉運。構成這彈丸城鎮繁榮原因，一是新興的農村工業－－如美菸，糖，監的外銷發達，一是交通便利，川西北特產，如金堂什邡葉菸，中壩江油山貨，均以此為吞吐站，在四川各縣的經濟地位，除蓉渝，萬諸大埠以外，堪稱首屈一指。</p>
<p>美菸之都生產運銷</p>
<p>作為開陽特產的美菸，新興歷史雖短，試種成功不過數年，但以其品種優良，每年登場時間較全國約早三月，故能後來居上，遍銷全國，東達京滬，南及粤桂。總計全縣，菸田約一百四十餘萬畝，年產約十六萬擔。品質：葉片寬大勻薄，葉脈織細，色澤金黃，氣味清香，在全國美菸中質稱上乘。種植：在春初散播下種，用豆餅作　料，和於菸田泥土作肥料，耕耘一次，築成土壟，再將菸苗移植，比及夏季，即成菸草，經過短時期，即可收穫。運銷：簡陽美菸，品質不亞舶來品，銷路遠走海外，每年收穫季節，滬穗著名煙廠，均派專人來簡收購，本地菸商亦在全國設有貨棧。運銷滬穗，沿成渝公路，由重慶轉輪東下，西北由川陝公路分運西安蘭州。本省多藉舟車輪往各縣·此外簡城及石橋，尚有新式擲煙工廠多家，規模大者，自設烘房，自辦苗圃，機器制煙。小者則純屬手工卷煙，因其成本低廉，質品兩優，銷路甚廣，供不應求，目前所出各牌，銷售尚限川西北一帶。</p>
<p>糖棉鹽花產運狀況</p>
<p>除美菸以外，簡陽特產，尚有糖·鹽·棉花等。糖在四川·內江·資中與石橋，並為鼎腳·石橋一鎮，糖房有八百五十四座，全縣蔗田約二十萬畝，年產四千五百餘萬公斤僅亞於內江資中。可惜的是簡陽糖產，不脫舊式窠臼，走遍石橋，難見一所新式糖廠。制糖程序：第一步先由糖房壓蔗成水，熬制糖清。第二再由漏棚加工提煉，制成精糖。純由石磨·鐵鍋·瓦　·泥漿與壓力，再加「熬糖師」的經驗，製造成糖。同時代表糖業三階曆。蔗農·漏棚·糖房·囿於積習，固步自封，雖則簡陽氣候溫和，但進步仍嫌遲滯。運銷方面，集中石橋，轉運川北，外運以西北為主，尤其陝西甘肅一帶，大部仰賴簡糖供銷·另外簡陽的鹽，全縣共有鹽井八十餘口，年產三百四十萬斤，惟以生產方式陳舊，鹽質未見精良，生產方法：「井戶」開鑒鹽井，汲水取監，「梘戶」運輸鹽水，送往煎熬，「灶戶」專司製造，煮水成鹽，這是簡鹽生產三階曆。鹽分花鹽·巴鹽·花鹽色白，成粒狀。巴鹽色黑，固凝成塊·運銷分「垣商」·「行商」·垣商專司媒介，行商販運銷售。簡鹽引岸，屬於川北鹽場，指定專銷蓉市及附省一帶。棉花：全縣棉田約七十五萬畝，年產二千餘萬斤，運銷川西南。</p>
<p>美菸·糖·鹽與棉花，構成簡陽的繁榮，也代表天府之國的富庶，這裏有的是綠油一片，菸田無際，疏密掩映，蔗林蔥蘢，煙突聳峙，井灶林立。這裏蘊藏著無窮財富，無盡資原，建設簡陽，正是建設四川的前奏，訪罷簡陽，對四川建設前途，的確感到了一部份的樂觀。</p>
<h3>黔省農林事業　「臉朝黃土背朝天」　加強發展地面生產</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽十七日航訊〕貧窮的貴州財政，全年省預算中，百分之九十六強都要靠中央撥款協濟，在國庫空虛，財政赤字俞來俞龐大的今日，此不僅在中央方面認為難於負荷，即穀正倫主席與黔省各級民意機關，也認為這實在是一個總有一天會來到的危機。在此情況之下，中央與地方都要貴州迅即努力經濟建設，非勤求自力更生不足以克服財政危機。</p>
<p>貴州談經濟建設，如工如商，均因歷史條件與經濟條件不夠之故，任你如何「百事俱興」，決非三五年內能夠達到自給自足有餘輸出的理想境地。在短期間內，能夠「吹糠見米」立刻見效，彌補省級財政收入支出的差額，而又能使人民得以享受努力成果的經濟建設事業，當然只有發展地面生產，換句話說，也就是呌一千一百萬人民更強化其「臉朝黃土背朝天」的努力農林事業。</p>
<p>惟以貴州限於氣候土壤，而農林項目繁多，如一一舉辦，既非各縣現有人力財力所能負擔，同時亦為自然環境所限制，終致徒勞無功。貴州省政府曾於上年度規定農業生產除適合各縣普遍發展之糧食作物生產，由各縣一律普遍辦理，並盡力採用開墾荒地，選擇良種，注意施肥等項方法，以期達到自給自足的目的之外，對於具有經濟價值的作物，飭由各縣把得天獨厚條件，就自然環境所宜，人力財力所及者自行選擇一二項齊力舉辦，以收實效，其中尤盼注重業在本省各縣普通種植，獲利甚豐之桐油·菜油·美菸等項為努力重心，期以美菸出產抵補食鹽滬邑，桐油菜油外銷換取花鈔布疋。</p>
<p>關於美菸栽培，貴州自引種推廣以來，已著成效，且形成各縣普通栽培現象，惟所用菸籽，因引種過久，純度汽車失，以致品質退化，不能繼續種植，省府主管方面經規定自卅八年起全省一律普遍換種，由省農政廳大量繁殖歷年在黔推廣有效之特字四百號菸種，按時盡量分配各縣，並經商准農林部菸產改進處運到大批佛光純種二千市斤，以每克金圓一角價發各縣菸農普遍換種，截至目前為止，計推廣特字四百號菸種七千九百餘市斤，佛光菸種一千四百五十餘市斤，何敬之院長去年在美運用純種八市斤餘，現亦在繼續加緊推廣中。據省建設廳估計，黔省卅七年度美種菸業實收獲量，約計為五十萬市擔左右，大批均已運銷省外，菸農獲利甚厚。黔省美菸之</p>
<p>栽培增產方面，雖年來成效大著，但對於菸業之烘烤分級包裝等技術工作，菸農多不熟諳，甚有食圓近利，作出種種不道德行為，影響外銷信譽，菸農損失甚钜。省農政廳於去冬創設美菸技術訓練班，調訓各縣農業技術人員，施以短期美菸專業訓練，計訓練結業九十餘員，仍分發各縣繼續工作，廣西省政府且亦保送學員七人來班受訓，成績尚稱美滿。同時並由貴州企業公司在貴陽，貴定，設場收購，嚴格從事分級包裝等工作，以示倡導，藉此皺取銷信譽，施行以來，頗收成效。農林部菸產改進處亦因本省美菸栽培區域遼闊，未來發展遠大，於去冬派員來黔協助，現已於貴陽設立貴州菸業改良場，近且與省農政廳合組農村督導團，前往各縣區實際督導美菸播種施肥等事宜。油菜為貴州</p>
<p>經濟作物之一，而菜油又為本省外銷重要產品，倘能積極增加生產，盡量購求外銷，換取外匯，不特可以增加農村收益，並且可以彌補本省財政赤字，故黔省府特將推廣油菜籽，列為各縣市中心工作，指派技術人員分赴各縣鄉切實指導農民利用冬閑田土，在不妨礙糧食作物增產原則下，大量種植，同時並制定各縣市增產油菜考核辦法，藉以加強此項工作之推進。貴州　在軍閥割據時期，飭各縣鄉農民在冬季栽種禍國害民之鴉片毒物，迄今雀苻遍地，均係當年所留餘毒，省府並飭各禁煙督導人員分赴各縣鄉督導禁種查鏟之際，就便督同各縣政府加緊宣導，大量種植此於已有益於國有利之油菜作物，現各縣鄉農大體頗能遵照斯旨辦理，此亦以建設代替破壞，以良政驅除劣政之一賢明措施。根據省建設廳報告，黔省卅七年度全省油菜產量，約計為一百五十餘萬市擔，十九均係外銷穗港出口。惜以過去油菜籽之榨製，多係沿用土法，以致</p>
<p>油量欠佳影響外銷甚钜，亟應加以切實改進，方能擴大外銷市場，當經由省建設廳於去冬責成貴州企業公司先在遵義設立一機器榨油廠，以示提倡改良，現訪公司在渝所購之新式榨油機業已運遵裝置，俟廠房修設完竣，至遲本年六月即可開始工作。</p>
<p>從貴陽南開的車輛，十九都是運桐油出境，而留心貴陽商場行情的人，首先注意的便是每天的</p>
<p>桐油開價，這原因很簡單，因為桐樹在貴州，分佈遍全省，據中農所調查研究所得，卅六年貴州省的桐樹栽培面積，約佔四十餘萬市畝，桐油收穫量便已達二十萬六千餘市擔，年來穀正倫主席隨時以增加本省桐油產量為換取湖南廣東之花紗布疋，勤勉全省人民，並希望在三年之內，全省增植油桐五萬株為最高理想，其增產的速度，當可想見。省農改所曾於工作計劃內特別提出規定，凡適應植桐縣份，均以廣植油桐為遷林原則，據報告貴州產桐著名區域之烏江流域如修文·沿河·思南等十二縣，及其他宜桐各縣卅七年度之植桐數，約計已達兩萬餘株。</p>
<p>黔省物產運銷公司，自本年一月成立以一，對粤所作</p>
<p>物物交換運銷工作，大抵均以桐油為主，先後運穗者已過一千餘噸，刻尚有五百餘噸，俟粤省物調會恢復工作後，即總績裝車啟運，貴州方面由粤省運回之食鹽七千餘擔，電信器材一大批，均係從桐油貿易中挹注交換而來，其經濟價值之大，不難估計。</p>
<p>除美菸·油菜·桐油等最著之經濟作物而外，黔省紅水河·赤水河·南北盤江·烏江·濟水江·都江·　水等流域下游各縣，氣候土質，均宜植棉，自廿八年提倡推廣種植以來，歷年產量，逐有增加，惟上年因中央停止補助，經費無著，致未大量改進推廣策由省農改所籌備大批優良棉種，於卅八年內大量推廣，同時並制定植棉注意事項，分發各宜棉縣份，廣為宣導督飭農民於宜棉地區大量種植，以期逐漸達到自給自足解決本省衣著原料問題為目的。各縣所需棉種，現已由本省施秉棉場準備一萬市斤，並向湖南收購湘產德字及脫字棉良種四萬斤，配發宜棉縣份推廣，現均積極辦理中。貴州的</p>
<p>農　　業　於上下一致努力，有它光榮燦爛的前途。惟以對外輸出有百分之七十五的自衛特捐，對內奸人作祟，隨時在邊陬小邑號召鄉愚武裝種煙，致治安問題終未獲得理想解決，仍困難重重·最近，因省參議會一屆七次大會開會，有省參議員暗中盰衡時局與本省當前情勢，主張考慮禁煙與治字孰為「第一」的事，這實在是今後轉變的一大關鍵。因為省財政實在羅掘俱窮，而中央又緩不濟急，治安問題愈來愈趨嚴重。為了「火燒眉毛顧眼前」，貴州或許對於禁政要重新估計，果爾，則黔省今後農林事業會受一大挫折也說不定，這種飲酖止渴的辦法，端視當局者之有無魄力來衡定了。</p>
<h3>對中共「國內和平協定」國民黨聲明全文　盼共方懸崖勒馬立即頒停戰令</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿日電〕中國國民黨中央常務委員會廿日通過於中國共產黨所謂「國內和平協定」之聲明一件，聞經即電達李代總統暨何院長，其全文如左：</p>
<p>中國國民黨對於中國共產黨所謂「國內和平協定」之聲明</p>
<p>中國國民黨中央執行委員會，對於中國共產黨所提「國內和平協定」八條共廿四款，特向全國同胞為左列鄭重之聲明：</p>
<p>一，二十年來我全國同胞因中國共產黨變亂而受之損害，實甚於日本入寇所予吾國家人民之損害，或且尢過之，但自政府倡導和平以來，忍辱負重，對於內亂責任問題，迄未置論，原期表示誠意，感召祥和，實則本當領導全國於民國十七年完成統一之後，盞人努力建設國家，早可復興，徒以中共歷年不斷發動叛亂，破壞全國人民所渴望之統一，乃使建國大業橫受梗阻，抗戰之初，中共於廿六年九月廿二日，曾向全國宣告四點：（一）中山先生之三民主義，為中國今日所必須，中共願為其澈底實現而奮鬥；（二）取消一切推翻中國國民黨政權的暴動政策及赤化運動，停止以暴力沒收地主土地的政策；（三）取消蘇維埃政府，實行民權政治，以期全國政權之統一；（四）取消紅軍名義，改編為國民革命軍，受國民政府軍事委員會之統轄。本黨原冀中共翻然悔悟，共同致力於抗戰建國，詎知曾不旋踵，又復自食諾言，到處騷擾，一再稱兵，若非吾政府容忍寬大，抗日戰局，幾被中途摧毀，國家命脈亦將被其斷送無遺。抗戰勝利以後，本當為求得人民之休養生息，不念舊惡，首倡和平，召開政治協商會議，訂定和平方案，並依據政協會議精神，召集國民大會，制頒中華民國憲法，求取國內之和平統一，以期實行民權主張，建立民主政府，乃中共始終堅持其以武力奪取政權之策略，兩三年來更不斷地廣泛發動內亂，遂致我全國人民八年抗戰犧牲無數生命財產，所獲勝利之戰果，國際光榮之地位，人民自由之生活，以及五十年來國父領導國民革命之成就，一一遭受無情的斷丧，凡茲明顯事實，皆為國人所共見，倘非因中共在其所謂「國內和平協定」前文中強欲以內戰責任諉諸吾中央政府，則本當為弭戰息爭，而儘可忍受一切內外之诬謗，但中共既如此歪曲事實，企圖一手掩盡天下耳目，本當為正義計，為真理計，為天下後世歷史計，決不能接受一個完全違反事實真相的責任。</p>
<p>二，中共所提八條廿四款，按其內容，完全失去協議和平條款的性質，直是對我中華民國全國人民與政府為殘酷之處分與宰割。中共此次提案，其目的只在樹立一黨專政的共產黨政權，對本黨歷年來所致力促成之民主憲政既摧毀無遺，對於目前人民和平之要求及自由生活與安定之保障，復絲毫未曾顧及，徒使中國整個國家與人民緊閉於其鐵幕之內，為波蘭·捷克之績，故為維護國家之獨立與人民之自由計，中共實應依照本黨本月十八日聲明中所提出之原則，商議修正和平條款。</p>
<p>民國卅五年一月，國民政府召開正當協商會議之時，中共曾聲言和議舉行之前，雙方必須下令停戰，否則應即視為協首次集會之前，下令停戰，當此和平關鍵，千鈞一發之時，本黨仍盼中共懸崖勒馬，立即頒發停戰命令，庶全國人民殷切企望之和談不斷中斷，全面永久之和平能獲實現。中國國民黨中央執行常務委員會，民國卅八年四月廿日。</p>

<h3>食米昨限每石一七〇萬　北市塲交易停頓　食油麵粉雜糧均漲五成以上</h3>
<p>米市因銀根轉鬆。國外物價猛漲，故亦趨急劇漲風·南市初開白粳一百七十萬元，後再漲至一百八十五萬元，今日款二二〇元。薄稻即款一九〇萬旱稻即款一八〇萬，今日期二一六萬·十時半社局令交易價以一七〇萬為限，但以金價暴漲，難以遏止，收市再喊高。北市場因限一七〇萬，致交易不能做開，市場停頓。午後門售白粳有高至二百八十萬者。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>漲勢如火如荼，銀根突　，各物均向前奔騰。而油價狂跳更暴，豆油開市到一千五百萬元，生菜油最高一千二百五十萬元，後以漲得過猛，稍回二百萬。豆油收市一千三百萬，生菜油一千一百五十萬，生油一千三百萬，各漲達七成之猛。豆餅貨少，狂跳七八成。</p>

<p>［本報訊］昨日黃金市況，形成飛黃騰達之勢。因銀根大鬆，滚上利息，立起彈性。且時局緊張，傳說紛紜，人心浮動，更是一飛沖天。場內交易照便停頓，以二三五四萬漲停，有行無市。場外現貨交易，因各方吸胃暢達，證券幫出股進金，開盤一出二千八〇〇萬，一八五〇萬，一路穿出二千萬大關，高至二一〇〇萬，二二〇〇萬，銀行幫，北幫電力拉抬，再升達二三五〇萬，二四〇〇萬。瀕午中央委托大德成，兆　昌，以二二〇〇萬，拋出三二八大條，臨收漲勢稍戰，低至二二五〇萬，二三五〇萬收盤。午後隔日交易，因金號幫競購熱烈，胃口奇佳，開盤二八〇〇萬，二九〇〇萬，直出三千萬大關，高價見三〇五〇萬，三一〇〇萬。二時十五分，央行聞訊，頻施壓力，加碼大量拋售，從三〇〇〇萬，抑小至二七〇〇萬，委託大德成，兆聖昌，無限制供應，一時金號登記踴躍，經紀人如國泰，大康成等，吃進五十，一百大條之多，連續賣出至四時收盤。央行為招歸生意，特於寬放十分鍾，拋售工作至四時十分為止，共計大德成代出九一九條，兆豐昌代出七一〇大條，總合達一千六百二十九大條之钜。今晨將有頭寸四千餘億軋進，人心始告轉軟，步小至二六八〇萬，二七三〇萬，以二七〇〇萬，二七五〇萬收盤。除息二百元，較上日仍軋高四百萬。</p>

<p>［本報訊］昨日銀樓飾金，一跳再跳，上午掛二一〇〇萬，二四〇〇萬，下午一度高至二七〇〇萬，三〇〇〇萬，最後稍低至二六〇〇萬，二九〇〇萬，較上日又漲一二〇〇萬，飾銀亦勁漲十三萬，升至二七萬，三〇萬。錢兌業烚赤，當日現鈔交易，掛牌上午為二三〇〇萬，二五〇〇萬。午後又高至二六〇〇萬，二八〇〇萬，亦加一二五〇萬。</p>
<h3>銀元馬路交易　漲風如火如荼</h3>
<p>［本報訊］昨日場外美鈔交易，因洋行幫紛起扒吸，廣幫金葉幫套購熱團。長開三五萬五，三六萬五，一路升至四八萬，五〇萬，臨收稍低至四六萬，四八萬收盤。午後隔日交易，開盤五八萬，六〇萬，曾出六〇萬大關，高達六〇萬，六三萬，終因漲勢過猛，去化轉呆，步小五四萬，五六萬，以五五萬，五七萬收盤。除息二百元，較上日軋高九萬。</p>
<p>［本報訊］昨日銀元套匯仍旺，各地續有數十萬套出。馬路交易初平織梢，午後更上一至，晨間大頭仍喊二八萬，三〇萬。迄十時光景，因金價猛漲，外埠價格如南京，漢口長沙紛紛報昂，人心思高，各方皺相吸收，一路連破三關，四關，瀕午高至四十萬，四五萬。下午交易混亂，曾洪至四五萬，五十萬，傍晚喊四三萬，四八萬。小頭喊三二萬，三七萬，鷹龍洋喊至二六萬，三〇萬。本票交易大頭趕五關，高至四八萬，五二萬。隔日交割，大頭已出六關，曾升至六二萬，六四萬，最後對敲字號，喊五七萬，六〇萬，又告追出美鈔。</p>

<h3>華股紛達漲限</h3>
<p>金價上揚，物價激挺，銀根帶鬆，暗息稍降，股市乃多亢進。永紗二躋其漲限，又創一七四元新價，時在十點三刻至五十分許。他股亦於是時齊魔，計達漲限者為台糖，上泥，永公，中內，中泥，榮豐，信誼，信和，浦電，世界，振漆，商務，統益等。催了賣者多，永紗漲限邊內，蔞起盤錯。近收以籌碼轉裕，售者踴躍，一低至一六〇元，午收為一六五元。他股隨同升沉，終站堅勢，收市比上市升五分至二十元。台糖漲六〇六九〇元。</p>
<p>後市平穩，雖有一部份惑於環境，但新賣鑒於穩勢　墮，亦未敢膠柱，以冒逆鋒，臨收又呈挺進。永紗僅十三元參差，皆在高度收市。他股一律咸漲二成，均登漲限。收市比上日各升三角八分至廿九元。台糖仍站漲限，其新高價為三六萬四〇五〇元·全日共計成交三十八億三九二〇萬股。</p>
<h3>塲內謠傳紛紜　紗價狂跳不已　龍頭細布突出二百萬大開</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗波動又告劇烈，缘以銀根步鬆，場內謠傳紛紛，且受黃金暴漲刺激，人心一致向上，本客爭相搜購，執戶無意拋出，至呈供不應求，市價狂跳清江已，結果各紗頻躍三成至五成不等。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳初開在買氣籠罩之下，竟竄出大開，晉一三〇〇〇萬新高價，午收略見鬆弛，為一二五〇〇萬，較前激挺三七〇〇萬。三二支銀月始開站住九〇〇〇萬，最後再進展至九三〇〇萬，猛升三四〇〇萬。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨由六六〇〇萬開出後，即飛跳至七七〇〇萬，近午買氣稍緩，終以七六〇〇萬結局，暴漲二六五〇萬。二〇支以下各級均向高峯邁進。</p>
<p>布市晨初承隔日後市漲勢，始開即見高檔，中途台面幫狂肆拉提，價再見喊高，午收略形回小，但下午復告猛跳。</p>
<p>晨開龍頭細布二〇〇萬，四君子嗶嘰一九萬五，中程各向堅途挺進，迄收因浮多獲利略有脫手，價微鬆落，午收龍頭細布二〇八萬。</p>
<p>四君子嗶嘰二〇六萬，較上日晚收各昂十二萬，收後十一時許，聞棉紗狂跳。故又加碼一成半做開，而後市趨忽進入瘋狂狀態，初開龍頭細布二九〇萬，四君子嗶嘰二八〇萬，開後各方猛烈拉抬，間各叩三一〇萬，最後在三〇〇萬關口站定。</p>
<h3>絲綢交易稀少　人絲狂升二千餘萬</h3>
<p>生絲昨由於存底不充，圈內外扒吸甚勁，執戶扳俏，不肯賣出，咸存保值之心，以黃金六兩二錢為標準，故昨午勢呈有求無供，散戶開出一一五〇〇萬元高價收買，但仍無人賣出，未有成交</p>
<p>人絲昨天橋興斯尼亞，晨開即期為五一〇〇萬元，午收為五六〇〇萬元，今票交易初為六七〇〇萬元，午收千至七一〇〇萬元，買氣濃於賣氣，較前午收狂千二千四百四十萬元之钜。</p>
<p>綢緞昨華強被面，初開即漲停為二八〇八萬元收市，收後場外交易，展開激烈漲風，由三六〇〇萬元升至四一〇〇萬元高峯，良以廠方無利可圈，咸不開拋機單，皮球交易隨之暢旺，勢呈供不應求，較前市升四成之多。</p>

<h3>茶市沉寂</h3>
<p>最近茶價，折合金圓，直上雲霄，惟實銷適得其反，再度下游，買氣淹滯，若干同業，已門可羅雀。</p>
<h3>廠商共同決議　計價以金為准</h3>
<p>據悉：本市一般工商業，因最近通貨一日數變，以致批發零售價目，往往脫節，原料廠繳成本均無法估計。經各同業決議，於廿一日起，核算方法，概以黃金為標準。將製成品重新改訂基價格，以黃金一分，等於基價一元為倍數，折合金圓計算，以資挹注云。</p>
<p>桐油漲勢驚人</p>
<p>桐油昨市：雖在時局迷離中，但因國內春銷絡繹，買氣盎然，過程依然活絡。吐納互做價，以黃金衡值，則猶原途盤旋，足度每擔三錢三分，青油每擔四錢，正副各牌兩洪，每桶三錢八分左右，而按本日金價核算，勢已奔騰，較日前一致猛晉八成光景。</p>
<h3>市塲散步</h3>
<p>— 君合客</p>
<p>恐怖緊張打於極度　各市狂跳不可收拾</p>
<p>昨天市面，以萬分恐怖的氣象發展，是時局的反映，也是人心的緊張。</p>
<p>「生」的要求，把米·粉·煤球·盡迫上無限高的程度。</p>
<p>金價跳過歷來的速度，銀元　得又急又猛。奇怪的，美鈔依然落後，證券還來一個漲停，眞有令人不可思議之處。</p>
<p>局勢，眞像當局所說，明朗了。市面的變動，從此也明朗了。首先叫人關心的，糧食·燃料。白米門售已出三百萬。</p>
<p>社局在市塲下令　限價，可是火　燎原，幾分鐘裏就漲達限價一倍模樣。</p>
<p>不是嗎？要死守上海，上海的柏油路和水門汀庭院，生不出糧食來的。爲了配合死守上海，全體市民正應該加緊囤米藏糧才行，所以不是限價的時候，而是應該放任狂漲才是。</p>
<p>其實，限價也好，放也罷，米市早在狂漲過程，積極發展中。</p>
<p>跟着米糧的激漲，油啦·粉啦·都努力加鞭中。</p>
<p>紗布絲綢，也在狂跳不已。事實再明顯也沒有了。</p>
<p>局勞發展下去，停車歇機的時間快到了而且，工資問題，現已進入一個新階段，不容責方在躊躇了。</p>
<p>工資負担，相應着糧價及銀元而狂漲，產品的紗布，當然要以更急劇的步子躍進了。</p>
<p>尤其是絲綢，試想春　快要上市，局勢一變，本年度的　子就有完全落空的危險。沒有　，就沒有絲綢。現在區區絲綢存底，當然更有奇貨可居的特殊漲因了。</p>
<p>煤木柴的來源，都不必說了。</p>
<p>石油，過去是落後的，今後也要突進了</p>
<p>有趣的，倒是茶，桐油，豬鬃等出口特產，竟也大漲特漲。</p>
<p>然而，把握住大局突變後果的，也有若干市塲上，表現得反有遠見的。如燃料·顏料·等工業原料，雖則也在爬起來，但只是爬，和其他市塲的跳躍一比，差得太遠了。</p>
<p>可是，他們僅僅臨時性的委曲，後來居上的日子，是不成問題的。</p>
<p>黃金·美鈔·銀元·無疑地都成今後驕子了。</p>
<p>銀元有實銷，金鈔易携藏。</p>
<p>今後的發展，會出人意外地反映到美鈔身上的。</p>
<p>昨天外匯移轉證獨漲一倍多，就可以看到有許多資金在大批外逃中。外逃的主流是外商。央行若不急急戒備，這大批外匯實源，白白賤讓給人太吃虧了。</p>

<h3>棒球開始展延兩週　中美兩勁旅明天先作友誼賽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕原定五月一日揭幕之跑馬廳壘球聯賽，現經主辦當局決議，展延二週，改五月十六日（星期一）開始。</p>
<p>參加隊伍，已有二十隊，榮經主辦當局根據各隊實力，仿世界職業棒球辦法，分甲，乙兩組角逐·熊貓，西青紅，美空軍等八隊為甲組；其餘十二隊則為乙組。</p>
<p>比賽將於每星期一·三·五下午舉行，週末停賽。場地在跑馬廳內，但如各隊能以交通工具供給對方球員，並徴得對方同意者，得請求將比賽改在其他場地舉行，比賽需要之球具，由美海軍體育部負責借與各球隊。</p>
<p>據聯賽負責人談稱：自前週公佈聯賽將於五月一日揭幕後，即選接各方函電及口頭抗議，皆認為壘球季之開始，未免太早。除美軍方面外，其他中外各隊，大都因籃足球田徑季節尚未正式結束，致隊員未能集中訓練，必至影響各隊實力。數經集會磋商，方決定展延半月。聯賽在本季內，分二次舉行。五月十六日開始者為第一次，採單循制。預算六月底結束。七月初，第二次聯賽開始，將改用雙循環制。</p>
<p>聯賽兩組各隊名單如后：</p>
<p>甲組</p>
<p>熊貓，郤爾頓，狄振戈（軍艦），聖騎A，德士古A，鄉下總會，西青紅，航空。</p>
<p>乙組</p>
<p>體運，軍官，德士古B，龍虎，氣象，聖騎B，葡商A，葡商B，紅星，野鴨，虎隊，西青藍</p>
<p>又跑馬廳當局以一略具規模之正式球類比賽，僅橄欖球一種，而橄欖球季早於二月底結束，壘球練習四月初起即已開始。當局為便利各球隊練習及使初學者有所借鏡起見，擬在聯賽開始前，盡力排辦友誼表演賽，明（廿三）日即可能有一幕精彩好戲，由中美兩方最堅強之勁旅對壘。國人方面，十九由熊貓出師，美軍大致由郤爾頓軍艦代表。（時間地點，請注意明日本報）。</p>
<h3>今日球義賽　青白志超交鋒　雙方各邀兵馬造成形均力敵</h3>
<p>上海孤兒工讀學院為籌募經費，主辦足球義賽一場，邀請青白與志超二隊於今日下午四時半借南市球場舉行，並由該院請五十二軍軍長劉玉章行開球禮，及美體親王主角焦鴻英小姐拍賣義球，入場券一律梅金圓二萬元，裁判員方榮富，巡邊員徐國　臧文彬。</p>

<h3>市長盃籃球賽　大公回力晉級　女子組鷹隊小勝約翰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市長盃籃球夜三塲，在滬江大學考試關係，鷹隊為滬大女生，啟六時開始，球迷二千餘，興高采烈。（一）回力勝懋勳四一比廿三，上半時廿三比十五。（二）女將鷹隊勝約翰，卅二比廿五，上半時十五比十。（三）大會勝莆隊，八十二比四十七，上半時卅七比廿二。勝者供晉入第二週賽。</p>
<p>懋勛先盛後賽，最初竟然十一比三勝達飛黃，回力不敢怠慢，曹志吉魏戍入場，方見轉機。他們AB隊聯軍，聲威頗盛。兩大學娘子軍會師，鷹隊楊淑君大顯身手，但第三節開頭，曾見十七比十六之紀錄，險被約翰追出。跑頭勢約翰不如對方。</p>
<p>末塲大會盡量表演，初戰時甫隊零落，有不堪一擊之勢，因大公的過份重視表演，莆隊始有掙扎餘地。下半時蔡文華進去，觀眾頗表歡迎，文化忠強柏齡三人，得分最多。</p>
<h3>回力勝懋勛</h3>
<p>首塲回力戰懋勳，六時開始，回力五人爲尙崇獄，陳正淼，虞鼎厚，白葆康，尚崇嶺。對方為王榮森，孫家雙，卓觀政，朱劍雄，陳鴻誼。恭森先聲奪人，回力崇鼎厚一連三分，不料懋勳威風凜凜，頃刻五比三領前，更暫停謀大舉。回力以叔沅代盧出，懋勳家雯打出勁來，一會兒十一比三，陳侃代劍雄，崇獄始稍能「應對」，漸呈活氣。十五比十，志吉魏戍同時「下海」調保康叔沅，老將手段，固然不錯，曹與崇嶺的合作，成十五平手。魏罰球超出，正淼「火上添油」，回力十三分一氣呵成，懋勳由動而靜，上半時回力廿二比十五轉機。</p>
<p>下半時雙方陣容大變，懋勳為陳侃，頌義，綱震，昭成，鴻誼，回力亦車輪對付。尚家弟兄，正淼，叔沅，葆康，戰局均衡。懋勳進攻的動作，好像慢著些，短距離的傳球過重，夥伴們很難接得到，回力福海出戰代叔沅，戰事結束，回力四一比廿三昇格。</p>
<h3>鷹隊勝約翰</h3>
<p>約翰，滬江（鷹隊）兩隊娘子軍出場，觀眾「眼目清涼」五分鍾大家在追和奔的當中，因沒有打男子規的經驗，拍幾下球，都像嚇勢勢的樣子。鷹隊王珊三罰不中，黃品珍楊淑君方先後掛六分，楊「刹車」頗佳，約翰似乎跑不動，張羅羅屢探不中，魏美瑾爭氣，漢運再中，第一節鷹隊六比四佔先二分。林靜怡的得手，第二節上去即六平，八平。靜怡罰中，約翰一分超前，在大學聯賽中，她們兩隊是平分秋色的冠軍，今日冤家狭路，分外眼紅。鷹隊楊淑君，氣變不凡，可造之材，王珊中籃，上半時十五比十。</p>
<p>看鷹隊幾個球員的姿態，據局外人的推測，可能有市體專學生「結合在內」。第三節起初，十七比十六，約翰祇差半支球，可是樂極生悲，鷹隊復見猖獗，瞬息八分，本節廿五比十八。末節約翰調動頻繁，猶圖背城借一，漢　來勢汹汹，廿六比廿三，姚惠娟五次犯規罰出，美瑾填補。鷹隊活躍的數人，莫不「汗濕青衫袖，」終以卅二比廿五勝約翰</p>
<h3>今晚乒乓甲組賽　華聯興師戰中行　前晚中行以三對二挫郵乙</h3>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽，前晚甲組郵乙迎戰中行於郵務球室，中行曾慘敗於郵務，此後再過郵家兵馬，人人拼命，個個賣力，果然有志竟成，終賴高鍾麟竺永康朱國楨三將之浴汗抗戰，奪得最後勝利。郵乙放棄穩健之抽手沈愛仁代以削手顧鶴華打頭陣，極為不智，五組名單排列錯誤，遂予中行以獲勝之機會。顧鶴華恰逢對方高鍾麟，高亦守球人才，顧忍耐不住，改變戰術，反削為抽，屢次觸網自，以直落二敗陣。其餘三四兩組戰況異常劇烈，中行老將竺永康於極度接近之比數中，險為郵乙削手鄭永泉所窘，終以態度鎮靜，力退永泉，可謂險中取勝，戴既失利，全副重擔落在隊長朱仲孫肩上，朱因心理緊張，演出失常，中行抽手朱國楨則愈攻愈勇，於先負一局後，連扳兩局，為中行奠定勝基，結果中行以三對二挫郵乙，可謂倖矣。茲探錄兩隊戰績及乙組各塲結果如下：</p>
<p>乙組結果</p>
<p>農機勝冠生（乙三））五—〇</p>
<p>淩雲勝弍蔴（乙一）五—〇</p>
<p>郵三勝明星（乙三）四—一</p>
<p>美亞勝新亞（乙三）四—一</p>
<p>郵思勝叔蘋（乙一）三—二</p>
<p>淩隊生紡四（乙一）五—〇</p>
<p>今晚（廿二日）七時起續有甲組一場，乙組五場，甲組由勁旅華聯出戰中行，後者乘戰勝郵乙之餘威，今晚再鬥華聯，全隊精神奮發，加倍有勁，華聯稱滬上五強之一，雄風遠播於首都，穈下如載手全材張志鴻，十年前於國際賽中曾取得中華隊選手資格，抽手鄧秀榮曾被選滬聯隊代表，曾戰勝香港孔聖會健將馬漢榮，為滬地爭光。他如削手李震，抽手盧文良等，亦屬經驗豐富之好手，全隊八將圴係粤籍健兒，惟今晚尚屬初次臨陣，狀態如何，未敢肯定，預料雙方會師一堂，上行齊心協力，必予華聯以威脅。比賽地點在南京東路一九四號華聯球室，場地經修理佈置非常寬敞，可容納觀眾千人，屆時不售門票，主辦當局歡迎揭幕賽之來賓蒞場觀戰，以表上次跋涉往返之謝意。茲錄今晚各場秩序如下：</p>
<p>華聯—中行（甲組）七時正華聯</p>
<p>招商—帆聲（乙二）七時正金門</p>
<p>冠生—郵三（乙三）七時正郵務</p>
<p>美亞—頤中（乙三）八時半郵務</p>
<p>農機—新亞（乙三）七時正善保</p>
<p>農機乙天翔（乙二）八時半善保</p>

<h3>大公勝莆隊</h3>
<p>大公五人最初爲存忠，文龍，忠張詹琛，柏齡。莆隊係林永盛，田兆祺，陳頌　，黃文澄，王開　·柏齡第一砲，莆隊兆祺亦中，大公黃及忠左投右擲，後容易的成十比三，存忠鼻破，根生出戰，上半時卅七比廿二。</p>
<p>下半時文華文龍代柏齡根生出，文龍不慌不忙，中籃易如反掌，莆隊苦戰難敵，兆祺文澄的射籃，也不「退扳」，不過還是相差著廿分左右。六四比四五，柏齡換出詹琛，詹因飯後腹痛，自怨自艾，尚未恢復，不能用力，以逸待勞，昨晚竟未得分，屠文龍遂橫行一時，終以八十二比四十七大勝。</p>

<h3>港埠際足球隊　在菲三戰三勝</h3>
<p>〔合衆社馬尼刺二十日電〕香港埠際足球隊預定在此三戰，昨夜最後一場，出戰馬尼刺足球會選手隊於裏榮爾紀念場，觀眾一萬人，香港隊以三對零擊敗主隊，創三戰三勝紀錄。</p>
<p>開賽後十分鍾，兩隊勢均力敵，其後主隊漸見不支，又曆十分鍾，香港勝中張金海在離門四碼外射入一球。下半時，香港隊左內鋒朱永強及張金海各獲一球，張金海之第二球，於離門十二碼處射入。</p>
<p>香港隊定明日返港，今日曾應菲律賓業餘體育聯合會歡宴。</p>
<h3>乒乓須知（十三）</h3>
<p>十·開球術</p>
<p>開球是戰鬥的開始。</p>
<p>在開球的時候，先把不執球拍的手的大拇指，食指，中指握球，球高離檯面約三四寸，再把球拍作七十五度的鞠躬式，並向球上作壓擊式。開球時，先把球脫手，再把球拍向球猛敲到檯台，再從自己的檯面躍入對方的檯面。</p>
<p>開球時開球人應站立於　端之外，雙手應離檯稍後而開球。</p>
<p>霖笙按：本屆乒乓聯賽採用情由行的世界乒乓規則，開球就依照上述的開球方式。</p>
<p>開出的球，務須先彈著一次在自己的檯面，然後再過網落到對方的檯面。要是球不在自己的檯面內先彈著一次，直接拍在對方的檯上，或者是從旁的東西上彈到外面，……這些都是不合法的，在規則上是算「負球」的。</p>
<p>開球時自己離檯面太遠，會受對方的算計的。但在初學的時候，離檯遠，開球就難，所以只能站在靠近檯端的地方，到練熟了，才好逐漸加長和檯面的距離。</p>
<p>開球的強弱，完全依球拍的壓擊力為轉移。壓擊力重的，那麼力強而球遠，軾的力弱而球輕。</p>
<p>有些人往往看對方站立的地位，利用開球，得到勝利。譬如對方離檯很遠，那麼開球輕，球的彈力小，使球落在對方的近網處，對方常會來不及趨前還擊；要是對方離檯很近自己用力開球，球的彈力強，越網直到對方的極端，既急且高，能陷對方於不及後退的境地。不過這種拍法，過分輕了，容易落網；太重了，又容易出界，所以非有相當的經驗，不能輕易嘗試的。並且從這上面得到勝利，很難比較各人的真本領，因此有些乒乓家是不願採取這種策略的。</p>
<p>開球的姿勢也很不同，有的把身體退得很後，兩手完全於在身前；有的執球的手放在身前，握拍的手曳到身後再向前的，後一種方法比前一種方法來得容易用的些。</p>
<p>練習還球的時候，在球離對手的一霎那，須鎮靜預備接球。因為預備的時候，提了精神，手腕自然生力，而緊握拍球了。還出的球，須越網或绕網柱回達於對方的領域。</p>
<p>十一·守球術</p>
<p>怎樣是擋球？什麼呌削球？擦球是怎樣拍的？籠球是怎樣的？</p>
<p>有些人主張拍球只要膽子大，打上去就算了，不必一定要先學這樣，再學那樣的。其實這樣的學法，雖是也會拍出一兩紀好球，但這是偶然的碰巧，是沒有把握的。拍乒乓先要學守，比賽也應該這樣。一個有經驗的乒乓家，常是以退為進，先耐心的守，以探對方的弱咪，然後才決定進攻的策略的。</p>
<p>守球的使手法純熟，左右咸宜，常能使對方疲於奔命，而沒有猛攻的機會。</p>
<p>守球的方法很多：「擋球」是守，「縮球」是守，「擦球」也是守。在練習的時候耐心的守，可以多拍幾紀，多得些練習的機會；在比賽的時候耐心的守，可以保持不輸。有時也會還拍得適當，得到勝利的機會。</p>
<p>下面先要分條談談守球的方法：</p>

<h3>人的故事</h3>
<p>— 洪奇</p>
<p>上帝創造驢子的時候，對它說了下面幾句話：「我給你二十年壽命，對於這個數目你滿意不滿意？」</p>
<p>「啊！親愛的天父，請你可憐我。假如我在這世界上活二十年，我要常常背負極重的東西，人要騎在我的身上，而且雨點似的鞭子，永遠落在我的背部。」二十年太長了！因為驢子的哀求，仁慈的上帝答應减掉其半數。</p>
<p>上帝第二個創造的是狗，他給狗活二十年。可是狗流淚吠呌着：</p>
<p>「我怎能活得如此長久呢？我將要變得年老而無用，」結果被人踢到門外凍死餓死，上帝，一半的日子已經儘够了」仁慈的上帝又答應了狗的要求。</p>
<p>再說上帝創造猴子，給它二十五年的生命，吿訴猴子不需要工作，也沒有什麼煩惱。但是它將生得非常醜惡，每個人都要跟它開玩笑。結果猴子表示不願活得如此長，只需十年生命儘够，上帝也就答應了。</p>
<p>最後上帝創造萬物之靈—人，他特別給了他三十五年的生命，滿想同樣產生拒絕的現象。不料剛剛相反。</p>
<p>人用一種不滿意的聲調說：「親愛的上帝！三十五年是一個多麼短促的時間，我剛得到安適，娶了妻子，有了子女，可是我要死啦！」於是，上帝答允把驢子餘下的十年給了他，不過他還沒有知足。結果，上帝把狗和猴子餘下的二十五年也完全給了人。</p>
<p>於是人開始快樂地無痛苦地活着，他吃，喝，玩……這樣地過了三十五年。以後的十年，人就像驢子似地工作，增加他的財產。繼續的十年，人便像狗似的看管着他的財產，時常發脾氣，晚上睡不着。再以後的十五年，人就像猴子那樣被人作弄，慢慢地變得老醜。這就是上帝創造人的時候，他自己要求的生命。直等過了七十歲，才默默地死去。</p>
<h3>食箸漫談</h3>
<p>— 陳左高</p>
<p>偶赴閩友讌集，見福建沈紹安製漆筷十雙，色綠如蘋果，上塗泥金甚厚，繪有梅蘭竹菊，花色不一，工細絕倫。（據云此係祖傳舊物，色質俱佳，與目前海上所售之贗鼎，迥然不同。）想知當年承平時代，錦衣玉食之餘，方作此「漆箸玉盤」之點綴，徒資「快意適觀」而已，使處民生貧瘠，藜藿甘飴之今日，卽有餘力者，亦蒿目時艱，何忍獨舉漆箸，而下玉盤耶？然吾國食筷為用之廣，由來之久，蓋有可得而言者。</p>
<p>筷之為物，古通稱曰箸，或曰筯，或曰梜；其質不一，或金漆，或象牙，或竹木，其詳見於經史，及各種筆乘。稱筷為箸者，如史記宋微子世家，「討始為象箸」。釋名：「李時珍曰：古箸以竹，近人兼用諸木及象牙為之。」漢書張良傅：「臣請借箸以壽之，張晏曰：借所食之箸，用指劃也。」稱筷為筯者，如王仁裕開元天寳遺事：「宋璟為宰相，朝野歸美，……帝以所用金筯，賜璟。」元李衎竹譜，更載及竹筯，茲從略。稱筷為梜者，如曲禮：「……羹之有菜者用梜」。注：「今人或謂箸為筴。」說文段注：「箸，曲禮謂之梜，假借為箸。」至筷係箸之俗名，所起恐不太早，明陸容菽閱雜記：「俗謂箸為筷，讚如快，吳俗舟行諱言住，箸住同音，故以箸為筷兒。」</p>
<p>今人於憂憤時，恒有投箸失箸之習，稽諸史乘，事有先例。晋書載吳隱之喪母，投箸悲泣；剪勝野聞載洪武間，宋濂坐罪，太後具重齋，作福佑之，帝艴然投箸而起。具見古今人情性慣習，連襠褲不無類似者也。</p>

<p>— 朱滄一</p>
<p>在英格蘭北部，每個小孩生下，父母就送給他（她）一個小盒，裏面放着一撮鹽，一個六便士的錢，和一匣火柴。這個象徵：鹽為健康，錢為財富，火柴為光照升天之路。</p>

<p>戰敗後的日本，靑年男女的結婚頗成問題，女子更難。某雜誌社竟異想天開，創辦空前未有的「集團尋侶會」，凡無伴侶者均可參加。入會時，將個人履歷詳細塡明，卽發備有號碼的證章一枚，佩帶胸前。之後，在指定公園內物色意中人，如發現所愛者，就至園中附設的辦事處中調查他（她）胸前某號的履歷。如認為可以，再去找他（她）一叙，最後提出求婚申請書。</p>

<h3>騙局</h3>
<p>— 裴晶</p>
<p>在九江路福建路口，三五個傢伙在做着買賣。</p>
<p>「啥人要絨線？壹磅只賣三十萬元。」</p>
<p>喊的人是一個瘦矮個子的老槍，身穿一件破舊的大衣，手捏着一團蜜蜂牌紅色的絨線。</p>
<p>「要賣三十萬塊啦？」</p>
<p>問這話的是一個路過的赤脚人。</p>
<p>「還講貴？儂看看貨色，蜜蜂牌呀！」</p>
<p>「便宜點好　？」</p>
<p>「天曉得！店家要賣七十萬啦！」老槍說。</p>
<p>赤脚人知道這價錢很便宜，但是，他還想還價。聽到他的回答，他沒有說話。</p>
<p>老槍繼續說：「狄格是小路貨，否則，有介便宜。」</p>
<p>「儂誠心出幾錢啦？」一個靑年插嘴問。</p>
<p>赤脚人膽怯地說：「我袋裏，只有廿萬塊，儂賣　？」</p>
<p>「瞎三話四，蘇州人殺半價，儂去問問市面再來。」</p>
<p>這時候，赤脚人聽他的說話不妙，就失望地走開了。</p>
<p>老槍見生意做僵，他又遷就了。</p>
<p>「喂！來，來，走過來。」他舉起手來招招，做着呌他回來的樣子。</p>
<p>赤脚人聽到他的呌聲也走回來了。</p>
<p>「隨儂加幾錢，賣把儂。」</p>
<p>「我眞只有廿萬塊。」他回來說。</p>
<p>「好，賣把儂。」堅決地。</p>
<p>對面走過一個穿長衫的中年人，對着那個老槍說：</p>
<p>「當心巡捕！識相點。」</p>
<p>老槍連忙藏起了那團紅色的絨線，一面又對赤脚人說。</p>
<p>「巡捕來了！弄堂裏去，齊去好　？」</p>
<p>他點點頭，便在老槍的後面跟着。拐一個灣，走到一條齷齪的小弄堂裏，他們都走進了。我因為好奇，也隨着他們走了進去。</p>
<p>「先生，帮帮忙。」</p>
<p>突然一個粗啞的聲音響了起來，我面前立着一個漢子，高大的身材，黑粗的膀子。他臉上可怕極了。我一想，原來他就是剛才立在老槍旁邊的一個人。</p>
<p>他為什麼要打我招呼？我聽了不由得懷疑起來了。於是，我放慢了脚步，遠遠地望着。</p>
<p>我看那在弄裏的老槍，把一團絨線，用紙包好。然後，再藏在左首手臂下的破大衣裏。赤脚人摸出了一疊鈔票，老槍接過來安放在袋裏。同時，他從破大衣的右手臂下，取出了一個包，這包是和左首手臂下的一個紙包一樣的。赤脚人接到這個包，得意地走出來。那羣傢伙也很快地走開了。</p>
<p>他走不多步，高興地打開來看。糟糕！怎麼是一包齷齪的碎布？看來這赤脚人急得實在忍不住了，回過頭來，怒目怱怱地追他們去了。</p>
<p>「喂！做啥？」一個穿西服的靑年走來問着。</p>
<p>「儂看，碎布當絨綫賣！騙子……！」邊說邊追。</p>
<p>「我代儂去追，儂先報吿巡捕去。」西裝靑年說。</p>
<p>赤脚人火速地追着。西裝靑年見他不理不睬，也自顧自走開了。</p>
<p>我恍然了。原來這幾個人他們都是壞黨！赤脚人已上了他們的圈套了。</p>
<h3>色彩的效果</h3>
<p>— 桑</p>
<p>妻在赴菜市之前，拿了寥寥的幾張千元鈔票，對我說：「這種一千元頭的紙張最差了！」但是在我與其他票額的鈔票比較之後，覺得亦不盡然。其所以會使人感覺紙張差，只是因為千元鈔上所印的顏色是種不大愉快的灰色而已。</p>
<p>人的視覺的確是最容易受騙的，尤其是對色彩所發生的感應。</p>
<p>如以前倫敦的黑僧橋，橋身原是漆成黝黯的黑色的，後來因為常有投河自殺的事件在這橋上發生，所以被政府改漆成明朗的綠色。改漆以後，果然這種自殺事件就减少了三分之一。</p>
<p>美國一家牛肉鋪，自從把牆壁從白色改漆成綠色以後，其銷路卽大增。原因是白色的牆壁在顧客眼中遺留下一種灰色的殘像，於是使新鮮的牛肉亦因之而蒙上了慘淡的死色。改漆以後的綠色，不但不使牛肉遜色，反有加強這種鮮紅色的效果了。</p>
<p>另一個著名的例子是：在美國一家工廠裏，女工們在食堂裏用膳時，常常會感覺寒冷，但是食堂裏所裝置的自動整溫器，都並沒有損壞，看來這種寒冷的感覺是不可能發生的。後來工廠當局試把食堂牆壁的藍色改漆成活潑澄色以後，這種感覺才停止發生。</p>
<p>色彩對人的心理感覺，確有很大的的影響。美國許多工廠，都利用了這種色彩的效果，來增進工人工作的效率，和减少工作中的損耗。如此，不但使廠方損失减低，利潤增加，並且也使工人因工作環境的改善，而免除了許多可能發生的病痛。</p>
<h3>天平與靈巖</h3>
<p>— 朱顏</p>
<p>遊蘇州的人，大抵有一個通病，都太偏重於市區。軟紅塵中看花，熱鬧塲中尋趣，「海派」遊客，此病尤甚。此次因偶一機緣，到了渴別十餘載的這個「東方威尼斯」的花園都市，第一個印象，就覺得蘇州本來是倩靜美好的，可給那些匆太的旅人鬧糟了，破壞了她的情調。</p>
<p>蘇州誠然是美麗的城市，但是她的美是要住下去，慢慢體會和享受的。眞正的遊客，應該在她的外圍去找尋幽趣逸趣。天平靈巖雖然局限很小，但總透着一點秀氣，足够普通俗人的我們怡情遣性的了。</p>
<p>車到木凟後，自然不必接受那些「轎子要　」的兜攬，只順便買根竹手杖，—價廉而物美，自己慢慢走。這是上靈巖了。在山頂上找一塊適當的地方坐下來，微風吹撫下，看看山下河山碧野。太湖如鏡，麥畦如絨，姑蘇城則在晴煙漂渺中，微露兩三個塔頂。這明淨的畫圖和聲音，便會透到心裏，除非你眞正走進睡鄕。</p>
<p>我覺得玩靈巖，卽此足矣。「吳宮舊址」本是最能引人的地方，但是我們看到一點不「舊」，興味難免索然。至於滿壁廣吿字的寺院，招貼了很多「遊人止步」，是很容易令人掃興的。</p>
<p>從靈巖走到天平，不必走磚鋪的斜坡。脚力健的，可以任意而行。到處是紅的山茶，白的薔薇，你跳蹭躂到山脚，必然要愛不忍釋地採了一大把的。</p>
<p>到天平了，才覺得有了「風景」兩個字的意味。天平的石，不枯而腴，雖不算奇，但相當秀麗。在范公墓的松林下，仰頭看看山腰的白雲菴，遠處的遊山人，近處翱翔的鷹，松　帶來輕微的濤聲，……這時如果是詩人，自然就產生了詩；畫家自然也要留下他的視覺之美；愚俗如我，在心底也泛起感激和喜悅的情愫。</p>
<p>天平是不必登臨的，因為她適宜於看。找尋那些鸚鵡石，一綫天之類的名勝，更不必要。比較起來，天平是勝過靈巖的，前者彷彿天生佳麗，而後者處處有鉛華跡象。自然界的美，「自然」是個基本條件。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Communists Brazenly Order a General Offensive; Communist Troops Land Near荻港; Major Battle Unfolds Between 蕪湖 and 銅陵</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] The peace talks, which had been underway in Peiping for twenty days, have broken down due to the Chinese Communists' declaration of a general offensive at noon on the 21st. The Chinese Communists did not consider the government's reply to their proposals. Instead, using the government's rejection of their harsh terms as an excuse, Mao Zedong and Zhu De ordered an attack on the government-controlled areas. In fact, the offensive north of the Yangtze River, which began on the 20th, intensified on the 21st. Communist troops, disregarding everything, forcibly crossed the Yangtze River near 荻港 in pursuit of their ambition to conquer the entire country by force. The war has thus resumed. The government is now preparing to fight back, aiming to deliver a blow to those who believe in force.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] After Mao Zedong and Zhu De officially issued the order for a general offensive, the situation south of the Yangtze River suddenly became tense. General Commander-in-Chief of the 京沪杭 region, Tang Enbo, in order to strike at the Communist forces and protect the area south of the Yangtze River, specially flew from Shanghai to the Xiaolingwei area of Nanjing by plane at 8 AM on the 21st to take command and direct all operations. Furthermore, Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou flew by special plane from Nanjing to inspect the front lines along the Yangtze River at 2 PM on the 21st, returning around 4 PM.</p>
<h3>Sketch Map of the Area Between Nanjing and 安廣</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 21st dispatch] The largest battle since the Chinese Communists issued the general offensive order began on the night of the 20th in the river area west of Wuhu, from San Shan Zhen, through Youfang Zui, Huali, and 荻港, to Tongling, a distance of approximately one hundred 里. The 24th, 25th, and 27th divisions of Chen Yi's forces, stationed on the north bank of the Yangtze River in that area, first occupied the sandbars in the river, including Heisha, Xuehua, Taiyang, Baima, and Wenyu, near Tuqiao and Jia Du. Then, starting at 5 PM on the 20th, they concentrated artillery fire on the south bank, heavily damaging most of the fortifications of the National Army along the river. Starting at 11 PM on the night of the 20th, they used over a hundred various types of vessels to transport seven or eight thousand Communist troops, who landed on the south bank. After fierce resistance from the National Army, by dawn on the 21st, the entire central area from Tongling in the west, through Shunan and Fanchang, to Hengshan and San Shan Zhen in the east, had fallen. Currently, the National Army on the south bank is urgently dispatching large forces to block and counterattack with all its might.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 21st dispatch] Day and night on the 21st, the National Air Force dispatched planes to bomb and strafe the Communist troops who had landed between San Shan, 荻港, and Tongling. Besides some casualties, most of the Communist troops dispersed and hid in the villages and fields. All the vessels used by these seven or eight thousand Communist troops to cross the river were bombed and destroyed by the Air Force. However, tonight, taking advantage of the darkness, the Communist troops on the north bank continue to cross the river stealthily, disregarding the bombing. At the same time, the Communist troops who had been hiding also began to launch attacks southward from areas such as Fanchang and Shunan, attempting to consolidate and expand their bridgehead on the south bank that they have already occupied. After the arrival of reinforcements, the National Army is now counterattacking.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 21st dispatch] According to reliable sources, the 88th Army of the National Army, which was responsible for the defense of the area near 荻港, except for Army Commander Yang who escaped with a special service battalion, the whereabouts of the rest remain unknown as of the evening of the 21st. It is reported that the 88th Army was formerly reorganized from the Parachute General Headquarters, and its equipment is better than that of ordinary units. The previous army commander was Ma Shigong.</p>
<h3>Order from Mao Zedong and Zhu De</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] According to a broadcast from the Peiping Xinhua Radio Station, the full text is as follows: "Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De issued the following order to the People's Liberation Army today:</p>
<p>Comrades Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhang Jichun of the First Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, comrades Chen Yi, Su Yu, and Tan Zhenlin of the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, comrades Lin Biao and Luo Ronghuan of the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, comrades Xu Xiangqian, Zhou Shidi, and Luo Ruiqing of the People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan front, all field army commanders and fighters, comrades of the People's Liberation Army in the southern guerrilla areas, the domestic peace agreement drafted by the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party and the delegation of the Nanjing Kuomintang government, after a long period of negotiations, has been rejected by the Nanjing Kuomintang government. The responsible personnel of the Nanjing Kuomintang government rejected this domestic peace agreement because they are still obeying the orders of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek, attempting to prevent the advancement of the Chinese people's liberation cause and to prevent the resolution of domestic problems by peaceful means. The eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the domestic peace agreement drafted through the negotiations between the two delegations provide lenient treatment for officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army and the armed forces of the Kuomintang government, and all other issues are based on the interests of the nation and the people, and appropriate solutions have been made. Rejecting this agreement means that the Kuomintang reactionaries are determined to fight their launched counter-revolutionary war to the end. Rejecting this agreement means that the peace talks proposed by the Kuomintang reactionaries on January 1 this year were merely an attempt to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing, so that the reactionaries could gain a respite and then stage a comeback to extinguish the revolutionary forces. Rejecting this agreement means that the Nanjing Li Zongren government's so-called recognition of China's eight peace conditions as the basis for negotiations is completely false. Since it recognizes the punishment of war criminals, the reorganization of all Kuomintang reactionary armies in accordance with democratic principles, the takeover of all powers of the Nanjing government and its subordinate governments at all levels, and other basic conditions, there is no reason to reject the specific measures drafted on the basis of these basic conditions, which are extremely lenient. Under these circumstances, we order you:</p>
<p>(1) Advance bravely, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate all Kuomintang reactionaries within China who dare to resist, liberate the people of the whole country, and defend the independence and integrity of China's territorial sovereignty.</p>
<p>(2) Advance bravely, arrest all war criminals who are stubbornly unrepentant, and pursue the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek no matter where they flee.</p>
<p>(3) Announce the final revised version of the domestic peace agreement to any Kuomintang local government and local military group. If they are willing to stop the war and resolve the problem by peaceful means, you may sign a provisional agreement with them based on the general outline of this final plan.</p>
<p>(4) After the People's Liberation Army surrounds Nanjing, if the Nanjing Li Zongren government has not yet fled and is willing to sign the domestic peace agreement, we are willing to give the government another chance to sign. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, April 21, 1949."</p>
<h3>The Capital Remains Calm as Ever; Troops Heading to the North Bank for Reinforcement Are in High Spirits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] After the breakdown of the peace talks, the flames of war are gradually approaching the capital. Since the afternoon of the 20th, the sound of artillery fire has continued throughout the night, gradually ceasing at 10 AM on the 21st. The general situation here remains extremely calm. The riverside of Xiaguan was filled with people all day on the 21st. They knew that the artillery fire last night was from the fleet, so they were admiring the heroic posture of the ships along the river. Order at the railway station and in the streets remains as usual. There has been no panic or rush to evacuate as there was during the previous evacuation. When reporters inspected the riverside at 9 PM on the 21st, they still saw everything calm, with only faint sounds of gunfire. Some officers and soldiers were lined up by the river waiting to cross the river to reinforce the front lines. They were in excellent spirits. One of the junior officers told reporters that there were no problems at the front and that they were going to reinforce. The officer's attitude was very optimistic.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 21st dispatch] Although there has been a constant rumble of artillery fire here all day, the people remain calm, and business continues as usual.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Government's Reply to the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] The text of the government's telegram to the peace delegation to be forwarded to the Chinese Communists on the 21st is as follows:</p>
<p>Immediately received, Chief Representative Zhang Zhizhong of the Government Peace Negotiation Delegation at the Six Nations Hotel in Peiping, and forwarded to Representatives Shao, Zhang, Li, and Liu. Representatives Huang Shaohong and Advisor Qu Wu have returned to the capital and have given a detailed account of the progress of the peace talks and brought back the full text of the "Domestic Peace Agreement" proposed by the Chinese Communist delegation. I have learned one or two things about it. Today, the country is so devastated and the people are suffering so deeply. After winning a glorious victory in the eight-year war of resistance, our international status has plummeted. All of this is due to the endless wars. As long as we can completely eliminate the scourge of war and achieve true peace, so that the people can have the opportunity to recuperate and the country can embark on the path of construction, we should spare no sacrifice to achieve this goal, so that we do not betray the original aspirations of the revolution, can answer to the ancestors of the Chinese nation above, and can give an account to future generations below. The government's side, from President Chiang's New Year's Day message advocating peace to all the measures taken after Zongren and Yingqin took charge, none of them have failed to follow the wishes of the people of the whole country for peace, and have taken the highest interests of the country and the people as the premise, seeking complete solutions, enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, opening our hearts and minds, and painstakingly seeking peace. President Chiang's resolute resignation and Zongren's previous telegram to Mr. Mao Zedong on April 7 were all intended to sacrifice oneself to achieve the overall situation. This sincere heart should be recognized by all compatriots. However, looking at the full text of the agreement proposed by the Chinese Communists, its fundamental spirit is nothing more than the disposition of the conquered by the conquerors. Resolving the dispute of brothers fighting each other is even worse than the form of surrender of an enemy country, and a deadline for a reply is set, resembling an ultimatum. It sees the beginning of peace talks as the eve of war. Even if the government is willing to sign it under humiliation, it is feared that this narrow and coercive style will stimulate morale and public sentiment, and cause deep grief and anger. Not only are the various terms beyond the government's ability to guarantee implementation, but the adverse effects and consequences caused by this are also beyond the government's ability to remedy. If this kind of agreement is once signed, it will not give the people true peace, but a more cruel and large-scale long-term war. The people who are eagerly hoping for peace will certainly not want the government to accept this agreement, which is nominally "peace" but actually "war," leading the people of the whole country to suffer a catastrophe and betraying the original intention of seeking peace. It will inevitably create a tragic situation of revenge and eternal killing. The original preamble is full of defamation and condemnation of the government and the Chinese Kuomintang, which is equivalent to a judgment against criminals. How can it be called a peace agreement? Taking the item of reorganizing the army as an example, the armies of both sides should cease fighting and make peace, and should be reorganized at the same time to realize the principle of nationalization of the army. However, the agreement stipulates that all armed forces of the government, including all army, navy, air force, general headquarters, transportation police forces, local forces, all military organs, schools, factories, and rear service institutions, should be reorganized into the "People's Liberation Army." All military equipment and all military supplies of the government should also be handed over to the "People's Liberation Army" for acceptance. The so-called "democratic principle" has become a system of exclusive occupation by the Communist army.</p>
<p>Regarding the reorganization procedures, it is stipulated that there are two stages: centralized reorganization and regional reorganization. The so-called centralized reorganization means that the reorganization committee controlled by the Communist side orders the National Army to first transfer the defense zones and warehouse materials to the "People's Liberation Army" for acceptance, and then go to a place considered appropriate by the Communist army for centralization, so as to be reorganized into the "People's Liberation Army." The day when this reorganization work is completed is the time when the entire National Army is eliminated.</p>
<p>In the political aspect, before the establishment of a coalition government, although the government is allowed to temporarily exercise its powers, it actually acts on the orders of the Communist Army Headquarters, and its main task is to assist the Communist Army in "handling the acceptance and transfer of matters in various places." The Chinese Communists not only want to take over the government's army and the national regime, but also want to form a terroristic rule through the Military Control Commission, so as to "accept all local rights and national industrial wealth."</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Political Consultative Conference, which decides the fate of the country and the people, according to Article 23 of the agreement, "After the delegation of the Nanjing Kuomintang government signs the domestic peace agreement and the Nanjing Kuomintang government implements it, the delegation of the Chinese Communist party is willing to be held responsible to make a proposal to the preparatory committee of the new political consultative conference that the Nanjing Kuomintang government shall send a number of patriotic people as representatives to attend the new political Consultative Conference and that after the approval of the preparatory committee of the new Political Consultative Conference, the representatives of the Nanjing Kuomintang government can attend the new Political Consultative Conference." In other words, the government's participation in the CPPCC must wait until the Chinese Communist party examines the government's performance in implementing the "peace agreement," deems it satisfactory, and then agrees to be held responsible for making a proposal, pending "approval." Even if the government is "approved" to participate in the CPPCC according to the agreement, whether it can participate in the coalition government must still await the proposal of the Communist Party, and the number and candidates of the government's participation in the CPPCC and the coalition government must all be decided according to orders. The above is only a brief enumeration of several items as examples. In fact, the full text of the agreement is full of the meaning of the Chinese Communists' desire to control the whole country by force. One says "People's Liberation Army" enters, and the other says "People's Liberation Army" accepts. The so-called peace agreement is actually to make the government recognize the Chinese Communist's conquest of the entire Chinese government by force. The government's army is equivalent to a complete surrender, and the social organization and the way of life of people in all cities and villages across the country will also be completely changed according to the wishes of the Chinese Communist Party. This will inevitably arouse the anger of the military and the people. If the Chinese Communist troops march into various places and Chinese Communist personnel infiltrate various places, it is almost inevitable that they will encounter resistance from the military and the people. As a result, war and slaughter will spread to every city and village across the country. The suffering of the people will become deeper and the losses of the country will become heavier, which is inevitable and needs no deep discussion. If the matter evolves to this unfortunate point, then seeking peace will only create a source of chaos, and stopping the war will instead expand the scourge of war. This is not what those who are loyal to the country and care for the people should do or tolerate. In short, if we can truly recognize the desire of the people of the whole country for peace today and all have the sincerity to seek peace together, then we must eliminate all hostility and thoughts of revenge, and based on facts, adapt to the environment, and jointly plan reasonable and effective methods to achieve the goal of completely eliminating war and achieving true and lasting peace. Therefore, in addition to expressing the above-mentioned opinions in principle on the domestic peace agreement proposed by the Chinese Communists this time, the government still hopes that the Chinese Communist side will determine the principle that the interests of the people are above all else, and reconsider the basic spirit and content of this agreement. As for the fact that since the beginning of this year, the government troops have tried their best to retreat whenever they encountered an attack by the Communist army, the facts are all there for all to see. However, not only has the Communist side failed to stop the attacks, but since the government peace delegation arrived in Peiping on April 1, the offensives in some places have become more fierce than before, which is very regrettable. In order to foster a peaceful atmosphere, it is hoped that a temporary ceasefire agreement can be established as soon as possible, so as to show the determination and sincerity of both sides to seek true peace, so that the peace talks can proceed smoothly. This telegram is issued to express this hope. It is hoped that the above opinions will be forwarded to the Chinese Communist side and that a reply will be sent. Li Zongren, He Yingqin, April 20. (Full text of the statement by the Central Standing Committee is published on page 5)</p>
<h3>Jiangpu Falls to the Communist Army; The Twelve Fort Bridgehead Is Also Abandoned; The National Army, Surrounded by Artillery Fire on Three Sides, Reinforces and Counterattacks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] Jiangpu City, across the river from Nanjing in Pukou, was officially captured by the Communist army at 9 AM on the 21st. The invading Communist troops of the 35th Army, disregarding heavy casualties, launched a night-long fierce attack on the city. Although one regiment of the defending troops of Liu Bingzhe's department had the assistance of both naval and air forces, the disparity in strength was ultimately too great. By the morning of the 21st, although the cost of 5,000 Communist troop deaths and injuries had been secured, the defending troops had suffered casualties to the point where they were less than one battalion. They were ordered to retreat towards Pukou at about 8 AM this morning, and the city was captured at 9 AM. Also, the Communist forces on the Jinpu southern section of the Dongxi Ge Huachi Battalion are also constantly attacking the National Army in the two Pu areas, but they have all been repelled by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] The 12 Fort bridgehead southwest of Yangzhou fell before dawn on the 21st after the defending troops were almost completely annihilated by the continuous four-day and four-night attacks by the 34th Army of the Communist Army. Guazhou and Liubao, across the river from Zhenjiang east of Twenty Fort, have been fiercely attacked by the 36th Army of the Communist Army since the night of the 20th, and fierce fighting is still underway as of noon on the 21st. Also, after nightfall on the 21st, the Communist Army launched an artillery battle from 12 Fort to Shiyezhou in the river, attempting to land on the island. The National Navy and Army are currently resisting.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Yangzhong Island, isolated in the Yangtze River east of Zhenjiang, is now facing artillery fire from three sides: Yong'an and Beisha Islands to the east, Laozhou to the west, and Sanjiangying and Kou'an to the north. The National Army believes that this location is strategically important and has recently reinforced its forces and launched a counterattack against the Communist Army. On the night of the 21st, several groups of Communist troops attempted to land, but were all repelled.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] It is reported that the Second Third Army of Chen Yi has sneaked to Tianxingqiao in the southeast of Taiyu, attempting to cross the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army May Launch a New Offensive Against the Outskirts of Hankou; Fierce Fighting Erupted Southeast of Huangpi Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hengdian, 21st dispatch] Military sources: More than 3,000 troops of the 13th Army of Chen's department of the Communist Army in eastern Hubei, and more than 2,000 troops of the 43rd Army of Lin Biao's department north of Huangpi, advanced in several groups from Songbu, Huang'an Changxuan, and Dian towards the Liuzigang Balidian positions of the National Army in the southeast of Huangpi at dawn on the 21st. After the National Army joined forces with the local teams to fight bravely, the Communist Army was unable to resist and retreated to the northeast of Huangpi. According to military analysis, after the Communist Army on that line completes its assembly, it may launch a new offensive against the outskirts of Hankou within a few days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 21st dispatch] According to what Li Pinxian declared to his colleagues at the Political Committee today, the Communist Army on the outskirts of Wuhan is moving eastward, and there will be no major battles in central China in the short term.</p>
<h3>Taiyuan Has Entered Street Fighting; The Defending Troops Continue to Fight Bitterly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] According to military estimates, the offensive launched by the Communist Army against Taiyuan City in the past week has resulted in more than 50,000 casualties, and the National Army has also suffered more than 20,000 casualties. Although street fighting has begun on the evening of the 21st, the defending troops are still fighting bitterly under the narrow leadership of Generals Wang Jingguo and others.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] Regarding the Battle of Taiyuan, on the evening of the 21st, the Communist Army had infiltrated Yongyu Fort, Shangbeiguan in the northern suburbs, Wohushan in the east of the city, Shuangta Temple in the southeast of the city, and Fenqiao in the west of the city. More than 200,000 Communist troops, led by Nie Rongzhen and Xu Xiangqian, launched a face-to-face attack again starting on the evening of the 20th. Most of the forts and fortifications outside the city were razed to the ground, and most of the main buildings in the city were also destroyed by shelling. As of 6 PM on the 21st, the Communist Army launched attacks from multiple locations under the cover of artillery fire, using cloud ladders to climb the city walls. At the same time, some gaps in the city walls that had been destroyed by artillery fire were also breached. The heroic street fighting has officially begun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th dispatch] Military sources: Zhao Xi, commander of the 61st Army of the National Army in Taiyuan, led his troops in a bloody battle with five times as many Communist troops for three days and nights in the area of Nanyidong Yijinggou southwest of Jingcheng. The Communist Army suffered more than half casualties. Ultimately, due to the disparity in numbers, Army Commander Zhao died heroically.</p>
<h3>Some U.S. Marines Evacuate from Nanjing to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] Forty-three U.S. Marines were originally stationed at the U.S. Embassy for security. Except for six who remained, the rest were ordered to evacuate to Shanghai by plane on the 21st to avoid accidents when the Communist Army captures Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Peace Talks Ultimately Break Down; Government Agencies Move to Guangzhou; Emergency Evacuation Begins in the Capital Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] In order to cope with the situation after the breakdown of the peace talks, the presidents and vice presidents and secretaries-general of the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Control Yuan held a joint meeting at 9 AM on the 21st. He Yingqin, Yu Youren, and Tong Guanxian all attended, and Acting President Li also participated. The participants all believed that after the breakdown of the peace talks, the capital would be threatened by artillery fire, and the government would have to move to Guangzhou. It was decided that an emergency evacuation would begin today. Except for the Ministry of National Defense, which would temporarily move to Shanghai, all other ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan would move to Guangzhou. The Legislative Yuan also decided to move to Guangzhou. Except for legislators who would go to Taiwan, Guilin, and Guangzhou according to their wishes, the staff of the Secretariat would all gather in Guangzhou. The date of resumption of the meeting would be decided by the president of the Yuan and then notified. The Control Yuan would also move to Guangzhou. As for the Presidential Office, it was prepared to move to Shanghai first and then to Guangzhou. All staff of the various Yuan ministries and commissions would be handled in three ways: (1) those who wish to stay in Nanjing would receive an evacuation allowance of 5 million yuan per person; (2) those who voluntarily evacuate to designated locations would arrange their own transportation and receive an evacuation allowance of 3 million yuan per person; (3) those who move with the government would have their transportation arranged in a unified manner and receive an evacuation allowance of 500,000 yuan per person. The evacuation work would begin today and was expected to be completed within three to five days. The meeting adjourned at 11 AM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] The government began to move on the 21st after the peace talks broke down. There were not many people staying in Nanjing in various agencies, so this relocation was much easier than the previous one. It is reported that Acting President Li and President of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin will leave Nanjing after the evacuation is completed. Their departure date will depend on the development of the military situation. Presidents Yu and Tong have chosen to fly directly to Guangzhou within three or four days. Legislators and members of the Control Yuan have begun to leave Nanjing in recent days, and the rest will depart in succession at 11 PM on the 22nd. The meeting of the Legislative Yuan originally scheduled for the 22nd has been cancelled. A chartered plane of the Ministry of Finance flew from Nanjing to Shanghai at 4 PM on the 21st.

<h3>Government Spokesman Comments on the Chinese Communists' Terms; They Are Expanding the War and Destroying the Nation and the People; A Surrender Document from the Victorious Country to the Defeated Country</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] The government spokesman recently made the following preliminary comments on the so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" proposed by the Chinese Communists: The so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" proposed by the Chinese Communists is not a peace agreement at all, but an agreement that expands the war, harms the people, and destroys the homeland and the nation. It is completely a surrender document from the victorious country to the defeated country. In the preamble of the "agreement," all the responsibility for the war is first placed on the government's head, insisting that the government has violated the revolutionary position of the Three Principles of the People and violated the will of the people of the whole country, writing off the revolution of the past 50 years and the history of the eight-year war of resistance, and completely slandering the personality of the revolutionary martyrs and the heroic and patriotic soldiers and civilians of the whole country. These go far beyond the so-called "eight principles." What is especially bizarre is that the government only agreed to take the eight principles as the basis for negotiations, but the preamble falsely accuses us of having already recognized the eight basic conditions. In short, not a single word of the entire agreement resembles a peace agreement. Now, let's make a very fair analysis of the so-called "domestic peace agreement":</p>
<p>(1) In terms of the spirit of the original proposal and the revised proposal proposed by the Communist side, it is exactly the same as the surrender documents signed by Japan with the Allied countries after its defeat and the so-called local peace agreement in Peiping signed by General Fu Zuoyi with the Communist Party.</p>

<h3>The Government Immediately Dispatches a Plane to Peiping to Bring Back the Peace Delegation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] The peace delegation sent by the government to Peiping, except for Huang Shaohong who has gone to Guangzhou and Qu Wu who is in Nanjing, the rest of the representatives, advisors, and all staff will be brought back by the government sending a plane to Peiping. The plane will take off from Shanghai and go directly to Peiping.</p>
<h3>Notifying Envoys in Beijing, Hoping for Immediate Southern Relocation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 21st] The government notified foreign envoys in Beijing on the 21st, stating that the government has decided to relocate, hoping that envoys from various countries will move south immediately. It is understood that the envoys have yet to reach a consensus on moving south. Some advocate for moving south, while others prefer to remain in Beijing. A final decision has not been made. It is reported that U.S. Ambassador John Leighton Stuart has cabled the U.S. State Department for instructions and will act in accordance with orders.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Flies Back to Beijing, Huang Shaohong Goes to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 21st] Zhang Qun concluded his visit to Chiang Kai-shek in Xikou and returned to Beijing by special plane at 3:00 PM on the 21st. He proceeded to visit Acting President Li Zongren immediately after landing.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch of the 21st] Huang Shaohong, after arriving in Guangzhou on the 20th, flew to Hong Kong at 9:15 AM on the 21st. When a reporter inquired whether he had resigned from his position as a peace talk representative, he replied, "Why bother to do that?" According to another source, Huang will meet with T.V. Soong in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Zhu and Mao Expand the Scourge of War!</h3>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party radio broadcast yesterday that Mao Zedong and Zhu De have ordered the Communist troops on the front lines to attack the Nationalists. This is their response to the government's request the day before yesterday that they reconsider the conditions they proposed. The Communist troops have indeed launched a larger-scale war, and the government has been forced to respond.</p>
<p>Regarding the harsh conditions of the "Peace Agreement" proposed by the CCP, the government instructed the peace talk representatives the day before yesterday that they were unable to accept them. However, it still hoped that the CCP would prioritize national interests and reconsider the harsh conditions they proposed, so that peace talks would not break down. At the same time, the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang also issued a statement, in addition to refusing to accept the responsibility for the civil war as pointed out by the CCP, it also expressed its sincerity in seeking peace and still hoped that the CCP would rein in at the edge of the cliff and immediately issue a ceasefire order so that the Beijing peace talks, which the people of the whole country urgently hoped for, would not be interrupted. The government and the Kuomintang's sincerity in seeking peace can be said to be extremely sincere in the eyes of the common people. Knowing that the situation has reached the final critical moment and that the prospect of peace is on the verge of despair, they still place a glimmer of hope on the CCP and wait for the CCP's reply at all times in order to "turn the tide."</p>
<p>But on the CCP's side, let alone the harshness of the "Peace Agreement" and its high arrogance; even in terms of its attitude towards peace talks, it has not had the slightest sincerity from beginning to end. The ultimate breakdown of the Beijing peace talks was within our expectations; but no one expected the CCP to be so daring and reckless, defying the great disapproval of the world, and repeatedly acting as the leader of the war. During the process of peace talks, it not only transferred its troops in the Northeast and North China southward, deploying troops along the Yangtze River, in an attempt to strengthen its position in the peace talks through threats and force the government peace talk representatives to sign an alliance under the city; moreover, sporadic battles have never stopped. This kind of peace talk, fighting while talking, is really unprecedented. To increase the difficulty of peace talks, we had to swallow our anger and wait silently for its development. Today, the CCP's war-mongering face has been exposed without limit. The CCP not only ignored the government's request for "reconsideration," but also replaced the reply with a crossing-the-river offensive. Zhu and Mao's issuance of a general attack order to the Communist troops yesterday clearly proves who should bear the responsibility for the war.</p>
<p>The CCP's belief in the omnipotence of force has been fully exposed; from now on, the people of the whole country should no longer have any illusions. The issue of responsibility for the war has been clearly defined, and there will be no more ambiguity. During the era of the Political Consultative Conference, the people were influenced by the CCP and its fellow travelers, and perhaps some people who did not understand the truth were confused and could not figure out the issue of responsibility; but now the ironclad facts are placed before our eyes. Who is war-mongering? Who believes in the omnipotence of force? Who is the leader of the civil war? Can everyone still not tell the difference? Now that the government is forced to respond to the war, the people of the whole country should support the government with all their strength to fight to the end. The CCP's warmongers cannot be realized for a day. If you want peace, you can only rise up and overthrow this warmonger who believes in the omnipotence of force. Before this goal is achieved, even if we encounter any hardships or difficulties, we can only grit our teeth, endure the hard support, and never seek peace halfway, otherwise it is surrender, which will inevitably plunge the country into a situation of eternal doom, and the people will suffer all the hardships within the iron curtain.</p>
<p>The CCP's military development can be said to be completely accidental. All kinds of propaganda it has made to the people of the whole country can only deceive the people for a while, but it cannot permanently cover up its views. In the past, the areas controlled by the CCP were mostly in remote rural areas, and all the policies it implemented were not easy to penetrate its iron curtain, so that outsiders could see its true face. But now it has moved from the countryside to the city. Although Beijing and Tianjin have also hung up its "bamboo curtain," its weaknesses have been revealed from the loopholes. Not to mention that people's lives are not free, even in terms of all social and cultural facilities, they have to go back fifty years. We talked to a Hong Kong businessman who was deceived by the CCP and went north to exchange materials and returned. He even said, "The CCP's success is unreasonable." Although this is a statement of indignation, it can be said to be the most appropriate criticism of the CCP. Therefore, we believe that the CCP is not really terrible. The most terrible thing is the government and the Kuomintang's failure to strive for progress. If the government can learn a lesson from this and make a firm determination to reform and regenerate, then the war against the Communist Party is a war for the people's freedom and a war for the country's independence, and it will be able to win the final victory, which can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>In short, since the CCP has ordered a general attack, the government naturally has no choice but to be forced to respond to the war, and the war will inevitably gradually intensify on both sides of the Yangtze River, and the local devastation will be unavoidable. This is of course the misfortune of the country, but the people must know that in the face of the scourge of war, only by holding the determination to die can we seek life from death. If we still hold the mentality of seeking temporary safety and avoiding the war, we will inevitably suffer the evil consequences of self-destruction. We hope that all compatriots who do not want to be enslaved will adhere to the principle of "those who have strength contribute strength, and those who have money contribute money," and work together with one heart and one mind to support the government in this forced response to the war until the warmongers are also willing to make peace. The power of the people is great and irresistible. Since the government is fighting for freedom, fighting for independence, and fighting for peace, and has the support of the people, the final result will surely be to win true freedom and peace for the people of the whole country.</p>
<h3>Communist Artillery Fire Fierce on the North Bank of the Yangtze River, Two British Warships Damaged Again, "London" and "Black Swan" Return to Shanghai, 15 Communists Killed, 25 Wounded</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to the British Information Office, the British heavy cruiser "London" and the "Black Swan," which sailed to the scene of the incident on the morning of the 22nd to rescue the "Amethyst," were bombarded by artillery fire from the north bank when they arrived at Bateas Point and Beaber Island near Jiangyin. The two ships were slightly damaged. They retaliated at the time, but in order to avoid serious conflicts, they decided to temporarily abandon the attempt to rescue the "Amethyst" and returned to Shanghai, berthing at the Blue Funnel Wharf. The British "Sunderland" flew from Hong Kong to Shanghai with war medicines yesterday afternoon. At 4:00 PM, it flew from Longhua Airport to the scene of the incident. There were two doctors and some medicines on board. It is reported that there is a square near the Shayao River, near where the "Amethyst" is stranded, which can be used for seaplanes to land. From there, it can be used to rescue the ship.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st] The British 10,000-ton cruiser London telegraphed Nanjing today, stating that the ship was also damaged by Communist artillery fire from the north bank while attempting to rescue the British ship Amethyst and has returned to Jiangyin. The London telegram also stated: The Communist artillery fire is fierce and does not allow any ships to approach the Amethyst to rescue the wounded on board.</p>
<p>[Reuters, This City] The British naval authorities here have just announced that the British cruiser London and the destroyer Black Swan returned to Shanghai at 6:00 PM tonight. It has been verified that there are 15 dead and 20 wounded on the London, and 5 wounded and no deaths on the Black Swan. The U.S. Navy is fully assisting in transferring the seriously wounded to the U.S. Naval Hospital here. The Autolycus seaplane, which left Shanghai this afternoon, has landed on the Amethyst with a military doctor and morphine and other medicines, and has taken an officer from the ship back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>[United Press, This City] The British Consulate General issued a statement by Ambassador Steven stating: He did not protest to the CCP, but instructed the British Consulate in Beijing to "inform the highest authorities of the CCP by all possible means about the bombardment of the Amethyst and her sister ship, and request them to immediately instruct the military commanders along the river to stop firing." The statement continued: Steven knew that the Beijing Consulate had received the order, and said that in view of recent developments, "the troops along the river obviously have not received the order to stop the bombardment, so it can be assumed that contact with the Beijing authorities has not been successful so far. Mr. Yuite of the Beijing Embassy has volunteered to try to contact the Communist commander north of Pukou in the hope of obtaining the necessary order to stop the bombardment. Without this order, it is currently impossible to reach the wounded on the Amethyst and provide them with appropriate medical treatment and relief."</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] A British Foreign Office spokesman said today: British ships are authorized by the Chinese government to enter China's inland waterways, just as Chinese warships are authorized by Britain to enter the Thames River. A reporter asked if the Communist authorities knew that the British ship was sailing to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River? The spokesman said: The Communist side knew about this long ago.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 20th] A Canadian Navy headquarters spokesman said today: The Royal Navy has sufficient warships to cope with any incidents in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. He also said: The Canadian destroyer Crescent, which is currently berthed in Hong Kong, is not expected to be involved, as the ship's main task is to protect British nationals in the Hong Kong area, and he does not believe that any Canadian people are at risk from the Yangtze River war.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 21st] The Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet announced here that the gunboat Amethyst, which was bombarded by the Communists and ran aground on the Yangtze River yesterday, resurfaced today and is currently anchored at its original location.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 21st] The British Navy announced here on the 21st that the British destroyer Crescent will go to Shanghai to strengthen the naval strength there, and the heavy cruiser Belfast may also be dispatched.</p>
<p>[United Press, Greenwich, England, 20th] Admiral Fraser, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy, said today of the British ship bombardment incident: "The most important thing is to think about how to deal with it. Our principle is to leave everything to the local personnel to handle, except for what we can assist, and notify the Foreign Office, the Prime Minister, and the Minister of Defense, and then wait for developments."</p>
<p>Amethyst Floats on its Own</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st] The British ship Amethyst reported to the British naval authorities here this morning that the ship had managed to float on its own and had sailed three miles downstream from where it was stranded and anchored temporarily.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st] A telegram from Dagang said that four rescuers, including two doctors, had boarded the British ship Amethyst to rescue the wounded. At the same time, a plane flew over the ship at 5:30 PM and dropped medicines. Artillery fire started again on this shore, but the ship had sailed upstream to Daluzhen. Those who boarded the ship were Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle, British military attaché, Lieutenant Colonel Cullens, British assistant naval attaché, Paca, a visiting doctor of the U.S. Navy, and another doctor.</p>
<p>Yuite Goes to Communist Area to Negotiate Ceasefire</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st] Yuite, First Secretary of the British Embassy, has volunteered to cross the Yangtze River from Beijing to Pukou to contact the Communist authorities to stop the shooting so as to rescue the 26 British naval personnel on the Amethyst who have been wounded for 36 hours without medical treatment. Yuite crossed the Yangtze River to Pukou around 6:00 PM on the 21st and went to the Communist area to negotiate. He only carried a toothbrush and 50 silver dollars and planned to enter the Communist line at dawn on the 22nd. He was wearing a naval uniform.</p>
<p>British Officials Express No Opinion</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 21st] A New York Times London correspondent said: British officials in London are unwilling to express opinions on the central ship bombardment incident on the Yangtze River before receiving detailed reports. The British Foreign Office declined to issue a statement, only confirming that Ambassador Steven had sent a preliminary report to London. British officials also revealed that since October last year, British ships have been frequently berthed in the Beijing-Shanghai area in order to evacuate British officials and residents if necessary. The Amethyst sailed from Shanghai to Beijing this time on a peaceful mission to transport supplies to the British Embassy in Nanjing. The British side had notified both the Chinese Nationalists and Communists in advance that British ships would undertake such missions in the Yangtze River during the period when British lives and property were at risk from the Chinese civil war.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of British and American Reports and Comments</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] The London Liberal Party News reported on the 21st: The British want to ask why the British ship that was bombarded by the Communists on the 20th was sailing on the Yangtze River at this time, and want to know why our warships were involved in the Communist crossing-the-river offensive. Was it absolutely necessary for the "Amethyst" to go to Nanjing at this time? The Conservative Party's Daily Mail stated: British warships have the right to protect the lives of British people in the Yangtze River. It is gratifying that British sailors retaliated against the shore. Asians should not think that the British flag and everything it represents can be insulted arbitrarily. The British ship's artillery fire has issued a warning to the entire Asia. The Communist Party's Daily Worker stated: Why are British troops stationed in China? It is nothing more than to oppress the corrupt and despicable Chinese government and protect the investment of large enterprises. All British army and navy ships should withdraw from China at this time.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 21st] The Vanguard Forum editorial on the 21st stated: The Communist bombardment of the British ship on the Yangtze River will definitely be transformed into an "accident" and will not cause British intervention in the Chinese civil war, just like the United States' non-interference in the Chinese civil war. Therefore, in the short term, unfortunate China can only rely on its own people. If the civil war resumes, it is a tragedy for China and a tragedy for the entire Western world.

<h3>The Economic Cooperation Aid to China Program Will Continue to be Implemented, Deciding to Retreat with the Advance of the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] The Economic Cooperation Administration announced on the 20th that the Economic Cooperation Program will continue to be implemented despite the resumption of the war in China. However, the General Administration has been clearly ordered by Congress not to assist Communist areas, and its activities will be greatly reduced in areas reached by Communist forces. Congress recently passed a bill extending the aid to China period to February 15 next year, and using the remaining aid to China funds of $54 million for non-Communist areas. The General Administration plans to retreat with the advance of the Communist army, but it will continue to provide goods and carry out rural reconstruction work in China's non-Communist areas and before its economy is exhausted. Within the scope permitted by the military and political situation in Shanghai, the General Administration plans to supply food rice worth $7 million per month until the funds are exhausted. Other items such as cotton, oil, and fertilizers, which have been ordered until June, will also continue to be shipped to China, but aid will be immediately stopped in areas that fall into the hands of the Communist army.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Acheson refused to speculate at a press conference on the 20th whether the United States will recognize the CCP if they win the civil war. A Chinese reporter asked, "If the CCP occupies China, will the United States recognize them?" Acheson reiterated his statement in a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying that although the United States has provided $2 billion in aid since the victory, the Chinese military situation has deteriorated rapidly. He said that military assistance accounted for about half of the total.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Acheson said on the 20th that to his knowledge, there were no American ships berthed in the Yangtze River area where the CCP bombarded the British ship.</p>

<h3>Government Spokesperson Comments on CCP Terms Continues from page one</h3>
<p>(2) The emphasis of the preamble is to confirm that the government should bear full responsibility for undermining the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, for launching the war; to confirm that the government's policies and measures are contrary to the revolutionary stance of the Three Principles of the People and the will of the people nationwide; to confirm that the government and the National Army are already in the position of the defeated; and to confirm that Mao Zedong's "eight basic conditions have been agreed to by the Nanjing Nationalist Government," so the signing of this "Domestic Peace Agreement" is merely a necessary preliminary procedure for the government to fulfill the eight peace conditions.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the so-called "war criminals" issue in Article 1, the first item of the first clause, which mentions "genuine repentance," "concrete factual performance," "conducive to the advancement of the cause of liberation of the Chinese people," and "conducive to the peaceful resolution of domestic problems," is intended to divide the government internally and entice government civil and military officials to surrender individually. The scope of its "leniency" is limited to those who have proven their loyalty to the Communist Party through concrete facts and surrendered. The second item of the first clause is intended to indicate that all government officials and Kuomintang members who hold firm positions will be regarded as "incorrigibly wicked" and obstructing the advancement of the Communist Party's policies, and will be "severely punished." Moreover, the so-called "cause of liberation of the people" and the so-called "peaceful resolution of domestic problems" have no clear scope, and anyone and any issue can be included.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the reorganization of the military, the various clauses of Article 4 explain that all armed forces belonging to the government, including the army, navy, air force, military police, local armed forces, military organs, schools, factories, and logistics agencies, should be transformed into the Communist army, while the Communist army is not subject to reorganization. The so-called "based on democratic principles" in points one and two of the second clause of Article 8 both explain that the original "democratic system and organization of the People's Liberation Army," the national reorganization committee, is nominally a committee system, but the Communist members are both directors and hold a majority of the committee members. Whether by order or by vote, our side can only be dominated by them and can hardly argue reasonably or implement its own propositions. The articles repeatedly mention the "areas reached and received by the Communist army" and explain that when the Communist army advances into the areas currently under the government's jurisdiction, the armed forces belonging to the government must not resist. If there are troops that resist and fail to implement the reorganization plan, the government should also assist the Communist army in forcibly implementing it. In other words, the government should order this part of the National Army to join forces with the Communist army to eliminate that part of the National Army. The areas and times that the Communist army wants to reach and receive are entirely determined by the reorganization committee and its branches controlled by the Communist Party, because all military organs belonging to the government (from the Ministry of National Defense to the agencies, schools, factories, and treasuries under the General Logistics Headquarters), all military equipment (military ports, fortresses, air force bases, etc.), and all military materials are included in the Communist army's takeover. Therefore, the Communist army can not only cross the river based on the agreement but also advance to Hainan, Taiwan, and any location under the government's jurisdiction without any restrictions. Many people attach great importance to the issue of the Communist army crossing the river peacefully. In fact, if the government accepts the clause of reorganizing the National Army into the Communist army, crossing the river is not a problem at all. As for the procedures for reorganizing the National Army, Article 8 divides it into two stages: centralized reorganization and regional reorganization. The so-called centralized reorganization means that the reorganization committee controlled by the Communist Party orders the National Army to first peacefully hand over defense areas and warehouses of materials to the Communist army for takeover and then go to locations deemed appropriate by the Communist army to concentrate, so as to be reorganized into the regular troops of the Communist army according to the Communist army's "democratic system" and "regular organization." The navy and air force are also reorganized according to the same principles. Once the reorganization work is completed, the National Army will be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the government's tasks after the signing of the peace agreement and the government's future status in the New Political Consultative Conference and the coalition government, Article 8 also has clear provisions. Before the establishment of the coalition government, government agencies can temporarily exercise their functions, and their functions are to handle matters instructed by the Communist Army Military Commission. In reality, they are carrying out orders from the Communist Army Headquarters. The main task is to assist the Communist Army in handling the takeover and handover of various places, in areas not yet reached and taken over by the Communist Army. Governments at all levels should be responsible for maintaining law and order, preserving property, protecting anti-government so-called "people's democratic forces and their activities," and "organizations and activities of peasants gathering in crowds" manipulated by Communist Party members. When the Communist Army's takeover work is completed and the coalition government is established, our government will finally handle its own handover and announce its end. The government needs to wait for the Communist Party to examine the performance of the new government in implementing the "Peace Agreement" and deem it satisfactory before it is responsible for "proposing" to the preparatory committee of the New Political Consultative Conference to allow the government to send so-called "patriotic elements" as representatives. Only after the preparatory committee of the Political Consultative Conference "approves" can the government representatives attend the Political Consultative Conference. This means that the government is not qualified to participate in the preparatory committee of the Political Consultative Conference. Whether the government is qualified to participate in the Political Consultative Conference and who it sends as representatives to participate in the Political Consultative Conference must first be determined after the Communist Party's assessment. The so-called patriotic elements are the figures liked by the Communist Party, and the so-called "reactionary elements" most hated by the Communist Party are absolutely not allowed to be representatives of the Political Consultative Conference. Even if government representatives are allowed to participate in the New Political Consultative Conference, whether the government can participate in the coalition government also needs the Communist Party to "propose" to the New Political Consultative Conference. How many seats the government representatives will occupy in the New Political Consultative Conference and the coalition government in the future must be determined by the Communist Party. Government representatives cannot obtain equal speaking and voting rights in the conference. If the Communist Party is dissatisfied with the performance of the government or the candidates sent by the government, it can revoke the proposal to allow participation in the coalition government at any time. As for the arbitrary and unilateral abolition of the constitution without legal procedures and the destruction of the legal system, it is especially well known to everyone. Summarizing the above points, it can be seen that the signing of the "Domestic Peace Agreement" proposed by the Communist Party is the government's unconditional surrender, the fundamental abandonment of the revolutionary stance of the Three Principles of the People, and the thorough destruction of the constitutional democratic government and all the army, navy, and air forces belonging to the government. From the perspective of the country and the nation, there is even greater danger, placing the whole country under the military control of the Communist army, and any region will become a terrifying zone of military control. The people of the whole country will naturally have absolutely no way to accept it.</p>

<h3>Commonwealth Conference Opens Today Attlee Continues to Consult with Various Prime Ministers Seeking Ways to Include India in the Commonwealth Mountbatten in Private Talks with Nehru</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] It was reported on the 21st that Sir Mountbatten will participate in the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference opening at 10 Downing Street on the 22nd. Mountbatten and his wife arrived at London Airport from Malta on the evening of the 21st, ostensibly to attend the naval staff exercise at the Greenwich Royal Naval College. Indian Prime Minister Nehru arrived at London Airport before midnight, where he was greeted by the Indian High Commissioner and others. They then drove to Mountbatten's private residence. The Indian Office announced this morning that Mountbatten had held secret talks with Nehru. Mountbatten has often been referred to as "India's best friend" and is known to have more influence on Nehru than any other Indian politician. The Duke of Windsor, then Prince of Wales, visited India in 1931 and chose Mountbatten to accompany him. Since then, the two have maintained a close relationship. However, he will participate in various informal meetings in an advisory capacity. Meanwhile, with the exception of Canada, which is sending its Foreign Minister as a representative, the prime ministers of the other self-governing dominions are now gathering in London to attend the conference that will determine the future of the British Commonwealth. The prime ministers and their wives will attend a banquet at Buckingham Palace hosted by King George VI today. Sir Mountbatten and his wife will also attend. British Prime Minister Attlee is also hosting the politicians at his official residence and will hold informal talks before the banquet.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 20th] Prime Minister Attlee began a series of extremely secret meetings with other leaders of the British Commonwealth on the 20th to find a way to keep independent India within the Commonwealth. Attlee has secretly met with Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, Ceylonese Prime Minister Senanayake, South African Prime Minister Malan, and Australian Prime Minister Chifley. Before the eight Commonwealth leaders begin their secret discussions on world affairs on the 22nd, he plans to meet with Pakistani Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru. When he met individually with the Commonwealth leaders on the 20th, secretaries and other assistants were not allowed to enter Attlee's office. The general assembly of the Commonwealth Conference will be held in a similarly secret manner. No official press releases will be issued on the progress of the conference, at least until after the general assembly closes at the end of next week. Britain insists that every Commonwealth country should recognize the British monarch, although each country can effectively govern its own affairs completely. At the same time, Britain is trying to find a compromise solution so that India does not completely leave the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 21st] The King and Queen will host the Commonwealth Prime Ministers at Buckingham Palace tomorrow. Queen Mary, Princess Elizabeth, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will also attend.</p>
<h3>Whether Soviet Peace Overtures Are Sincere Depends on Future Attitude Western Anti-Blockade Suffocates East German Economy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] A qualified official stated on the 20th that the U.S. government has not yet been able to determine whether the Soviet Union's "peace overtures" in Fubu are sincere or a propaganda tactic. After agreeing with reporters not to disclose his surname and the department he represents, he read a statement, carefully analyzing the noisy "peace" reports. He went on to say that the government does not intend to deny or confirm these messages in order to "avoid public misunderstanding."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] U.S. Military Governor Clay declared today that he had not heard of the Soviet proposal to lift the Berlin blockade. The Soviet side also kept silent, but an official from a small country's consulate claimed to have heard of the statement. The economy of the Soviet-occupied zone is suffocating, and the steel, electrical materials, and precision instruments needed for manufacturing are all subject to an embargo by Western countries. A German railway administrator who recently escaped from the Soviet zone told the West Berlin city government that the East Berlin city government could not maintain itself for more than a month. Railway vehicles are in disrepair, trains are delayed, and locomotives that should be repaired have to work twice as hard. East German police, with Soviet permission, have slightly relaxed border surveillance today, but Berlin Communist police have blocked off most streets. The U.S. military is implementing new tariff controls on U.S. citizens and allied nationals in the occupied zone to prevent smuggling to Austria and Czechoslovakia. According to recent U.S. official estimates, goods smuggled across the West German border amount to approximately 200 million U.S. dollars per year.</p>
<p>Lifting the Blockade Soviet Adds Conditions</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] A German official stated today that the Soviet Union intends to propose a plan to the U.S. and Britain to lift the Berlin blockade, but only on the condition that Germany be prohibited from joining the Atlantic Treaty, U.S., British, and French troops withdraw to the banks of the Rhine River, and a German central government be jointly established by the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. In addition to lifting the Berlin blockade, the Soviet Union also agrees to withdraw its troops to the banks of the Oder River. U.S. and British authorities neither confirm nor deny this statement.</p>
<p>Germans Eager for Resumption of Trade</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 21st] Heinrich Rau, chairman of the German Economic Commission in the Soviet-occupied zone, suggested today that if Western countries end their anti-blockade against the Soviet-occupied zone, the Soviet Union should lift the Berlin blockade. Rau made the above suggestion in a question-and-answer session with Chang, a reporter for the Communist Party newspaper "Neues Deutschland." He said, "If Western countries lift their ban on trade between the zones, the exchange of goods between the eastern and western zones may resume." He confirmed that German officials from the eastern and western zones had discussed the issue of lifting trade restrictions but said that this was initiated by German officials in the western zone and that the negotiations were held several weeks ago. He also denied that he had told his Economic Commission that the Berlin blockade must be lifted to prevent the economic collapse of the Soviet-occupied zone.</p>
<p>According to the US and British occupying authorities, the Eastern District Economic Commission had submitted an informal letter to the Western District German trade officials on the 20th suggesting to abolish trade barriers. At the same time, the Soviet occupation army newspaper "Daily Review" stated that "Many Germans in West Berlin have expressed their willingness to trade with the Soviet occupation zone."</p>
<h3>Clay Hit by "Enemy" Machine Gun U.S. Military Exercise Realistic Radar Station Fails "Enemy" Troops Penetrate Deep</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 20th] In the U.S. military exercise in Germany, the "enemy" forces penetrated deeper into the U.S. military zone today, and more than 1,000 U.S. soldiers were "injured." The U.S. Air Force radar early warning station in Germany failed again, allowing "enemy" aircraft to arbitrarily strafe the "retreating" U.S. troops. Ten of the injured were "presumed dead." According to the "enemy" Air Force Command, U.S. Military Governor and Commander of U.S. Forces in Germany Clay arrived by plane to inspect the area and was "hit" by "enemy" machine gun fire when he got off the plane. General Huebner, who was at the airport to greet Clay, was also "injured." The retreating U.S. military engineers "destroyed" all military affairs, leaving only three bridges on the Ludwig Canal. West of the canal, the main force of the U.S. infantry and armored forces is deployed along a 95-mile line to make a final stand. The U.S. military will strive to regain the lost air supremacy in accordance with the predetermined exercise plan.</p>

<h3>Germans Should Have Political Self-Determination Rights Unwilling to Be Interfered with by Allied Powers Social Democratic Party Participates in Constitution-Making, Presents Six Conditions</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Hanover, 20th] The Social Democratic Party Congress, meeting here today, refused to agree to any West German constitution unless consideration is given to the six conditions determined by the party to enable Germans to obtain autonomous rights. The congress believes that the six conditions are the "last possibility" for the Social Democratic Party to continue to participate in the Bonn Constituent Assembly. The six conditions are: (1) Germans have the right to self-determination and are free from foreign interference; (2) the "Basic Law" (constitution) should be reduced to the minimum; (3) the powers of the second chamber should be reduced; (4) economic and political unity should be maintained in all aspects, especially in legislation; (5) the financial problem should be resolved so that the parliament can complete its tasks; (6) a single social law should be implemented in all parts of the federation, both domestically and abroad. The temporary constitution drafted by the Social Democratic Party will be announced in a few days after being approved by the party congress. The congress also passed a resolution, recalling that the German parties had reached an agreement on the constitution, but due to foreign interference, the attitude of the Christian Democratic Party has been destroyed. The resolution believes that the intervention of the Allied powers has "endangered the concept of democracy." It also stated that the free expression of the German people's political aspirations, rather than the directives of the Allied powers, can prevent the rise of nationalist or communist forces. The Christian Democratic Party's Ehard, Prime Minister of Bavaria, said tonight that Hanover's decision "is tantamount to an ultimatum" and will increase the internal divisions of the Bonn Constituent Assembly. Adenauer, Chairman of the Constituent Assembly and leader of the Christian Democratic Party, also emphasized the seriousness of the situation in the Bonn Constituent Assembly.</p>
<h3>Acheson Attends Senate Foreign Relations Committee Reports on U.S. Military Aid Plan First Year's Costs to Be at Least $1.2 Billion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Amid demands from Republican senators for the immediate publication of the government's global military assistance plan, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a closed-door meeting this afternoon to hear the first official details about the plan from Secretary of State Acheson. It is reported that the first year's costs of the military aid plan will be between $1.2 billion and $2 billion. According to a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he believes that the plan will supply Western Europe with $800 million worth of military equipment, and the remainder will be allocated to Greece, Turkey, and South Korea. However, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally said he was doubtful whether the plan would be released after the meeting. But Republican senators believe that all the details will be released immediately, as they have already made this request so that they can consider the arms plan and the Atlantic Treaty at the same time.</p>

<h3>Churchill Urges Unified European Economy to Avoid Becoming Beggars or Slaves</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Churchill addressed the European Movement Economic Conference of 21 nations today, reiterating his call for a united Europe. He said that as Europe will have to either sink or swim together, we must think, plan, and strive for the sake of our country and Europe if we do not want to be beggars or slaves. Churchill said that the old system of Europe with twenty-odd countries and its economic units is a stupid system. If Europe attempts to revive in the traditional way, it will never succeed. The evolution caused by the two world wars in 35 years has surpassed the evolution in an average of 100 years. Considering the developments of the late nineteenth century, unless Europe firmly and unifies its economic strength, it will inevitably fall into economic difficulties. We must have currencies that can be freely exchanged as before 1914, and we can go to any place without passports, and there will be no inconvertible money. This seems like a utopian world, but by that time, it will not be surprising. In short, this is the goal we must strive for. Jouhaux, the head of the French General Confederation of Labor, said that the Social and Business Committee of the European Movement should cooperate with the International Labor Organization to prepare for the effective unification of European labor legislation. Jouhaux also advocated collective implementation of important industries and the construction of sluices, tunnels, housing, and atomic power plants to provide homes for the unemployed. The conference is divided into six committees: currency, social and commercial affairs, basic industries, agriculture, overseas territories, and constitutional affairs, which will begin separate discussions on the 21st.</p>

<h3>Paris Peace Conference Passes Resolution Protesting France's Withholding of Passports Black Singer Robeson Elected to Presidium</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 20th] Nenni, the leader of the Italian left-wing Socialist Party, addressed the World Peace Conference, attended by representatives from 59 countries, today, declaring that if a new war breaks out, the people of the participating countries will rise up and attack it. The current World Peace Conference is determined to achieve peace in various ways. At the second meeting this afternoon, presided over by the Vice-Chairman of the Organizing Committee of this Conference, British physicist Bernal, the audience applauded after American black bass singer Robeson was elected as one of the chairmen. First, the conference unanimously passed a resolution protesting the unreasonable attempts by the French government and the American authorities in Japan to prevent 370 representatives from ten countries from coming to Paris to attend the conference. Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the French Atomic Energy Commission and Chairman of the Conference Organizing Committee, extended a special welcome to the representatives of China, Spain, Greece, and Viet Minh.</p>
<h3>Robeson's Speech: Black People Will Not Fight Against the Soviet Union; Two Thousand Representatives All Rose and Cheered</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris 20th] American black singer Paul Robeson said in a speech at the World Congress of Supporters of Peace today that American black people would never fight against the Soviet Union. Mr. Robeson's loud voice broke the monotonous atmosphere of the conference that only criticized the North Atlantic Treaty, the U.S. atomic policy, the Marshall Plan, and Anglo-American capitalist imperialism for the first time. Robeson said, "I bring good news from the American black people, stating that they do not want a war to send them back to a new kind of slave life. We only want to strive for the friendship of the Soviet Union, Eastern democracy, and free China." At this point in Robeson's speech, all 2,000 delegates rose and cheered. Robeson also said that President Truman's colonial development plan would plunge Africans into a new kind of slavery. It is inconceivable that American black people would shed blood for those who have oppressed us for generations, and fight against those who have raised our status in one generation to enjoy the full dignity of mankind. American wealth is created by millions of colonial workers and millions of black people in Eastern Europe. We are now determined to enjoy this wealth.</p>
<h3>Inauguration of the Czech Branch: Communicating with Paris</h3>

<h3>Italy's Pre-War African Colonies Should Be Placed Under UN Trusteeship: China Proposes a Plan Similar to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press Lake Success 20th] China proposed a plan on the 20th to dispose of the former Italian colonies, which is similar to the Soviet plan in some respects. Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo said in the UN Political Committee that although many representatives advocated that each relevant territory should be placed under trusteeship by a separate country, there was little agreement on the details. He suggested that the Italian colonies be placed under UN trusteeship, with the exception of a part of East Eritrea. He said that it should be merged into Abyssinia because its residents are of Abyssinian race and culture. Dr. Koo suggested: (1) The United Nations should place Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, and most of Eritrea, Masori Land, and other places under trusteeship. (2) The Trusteeship Council should appoint an administrator for each region and submit it to the General Assembly for consideration, and establish an advisory committee composed of five to seven people to assist the administrator. (3) If the immediate independence of Libya is deemed impractical, the trusteeship of Libya should end after five years, and independence should be granted immediately. Somaliland should become independent after ten years, or in other ways according to the free will of the local residents. The Political Committee has ended the initial discussion on the Italian colonial issue, but there are so many conflicting suggestions on how to dispose of the Italian colonies that it may be difficult to resolve during this session of the General Assembly.</p>

<h3>Secretary-General Chen's Speech: To Cope with the Future Situation, This City is Fully Prepared; There is No Fear of Shortage of Food and Fuel; Meeting Today to Discuss Raising Security Donations</h3>
<p>The peace talks have suffered another setback, and the Communist army has threatened to cross the Yangtze River to invade the south. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited Secretary-General Chen of the municipal government to inquire whether Shanghai had a complete emergency plan if the war continued to occur. He said that Shanghai is the economic center of our country, and the government is determined to protect it with all its strength. Now it is fully prepared. If it is invaded, it will strike those who strike. Mr. Chen also stated the various points that have been prepared as follows: (1) In terms of military affairs, Shanghai is now stationed with many elite troops, and the four-effect defense project has been completed, which is enough to protect Greater Shanghai and defend against any invasion. (2) In terms of politics, the government has the greatest determination to maintain the security and order of the city, so that all citizens can share the joys and sorrows and overcome the difficulties together. The military camps that protect Shanghai and maintain security will be given generous treatment so that they can be secure in their work and fulfill their duties. The government will also find ways to enable the general public to maintain their livelihoods. (3) In terms of economy, the daily necessities of the general public will be properly resolved one by one. For example, the most important food and fuel are stored very abundantly and can be continuously supplied by sea, so there is no fear of shortage. In addition, in order to stabilize the lives of the military and police in this city, it is scheduled to convene various trade associations in this city this afternoon to hold a meeting to discuss raising security donations. Because current prices are soaring, it is proposed to increase the security donation from one percent to two percent in order to solve the problem of non-staple food for the military and police, and to achieve the goal of contributing strength and money. Finally, Mr. Chen said that we are still praying for peace, but in case of emergency, we have to make full preparations.</p>

In view of the seriousness of the current situation, I have decided to take all necessary measures to strengthen vigilance in order to maintain local security and protect the safety of citizens. If any conspirators instigate trouble, spread rumors, shake people's hearts, or speculate and manipulate, disrupt finance, strike and slack off, gather crowds for riots, and other behaviors that disrupt security, they will be severely punished and executed on the spot in accordance with the provisions of military-period martial law. I hope that all colleagues in this city will share the government's ultimate intention to love the country and care for the people, distinguish right from wrong, recognize the pros and cons, be secure in their own jobs, and overcome the time limit together."</p>

It is possible that one representative each will be sent by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, and the Federation of Trade Unions to jointly agree. The date on which the cost of living index is based should be the average daily, the highest price day, or the day before the cost of living index, which will also be discussed in the Labor-Management Assessment Committee.

The Social Affairs Bureau expressed its sympathy for the plight of the workers' lives. If there is no advance wage payment situation in each factory, it is considered reasonable to calculate the highest daily price each month. This issue will be raised at today's Labor-Management Assessment Committee.</p>
<h3>The Silk Weaving Trade Union Petitions, Requesting to Be Paid in Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The directors and supervisors of the Silk Weaving Trade Union petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting that gold be paid in silver dollars at half the base salary and that physical objects be distributed. The Social Affairs Bureau will submit it to the Labor-Management Assessment Committee for discussion today.</p>
<h3>The Method of Calculating Wages in Silver Dollars is Not Paying Wages in Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the Municipal Trade Union Council, issued another statement on the issue of calculating wages in silver dollars as follows: "Due to the soaring prices, the lives of employees who calculate wages according to the cost of living index are severely threatened. In order to thoroughly solve this problem, this association has suggested to the authorities to calculate wages in silver dollars in order to stabilize the lives of employees and maintain production order. Although the discussions from all parties in recent days have gained sympathy, there are still many misunderstandings, such as the acting Mayor Chen said that paying wages in silver dollars is difficult to achieve for a while because the Central Bank is afraid of not having huge amounts of silver dollars. It must be known that what this association proposes is to calculate wages in silver dollars, not to pay wages in silver dollars. A word of mistake makes a big difference. The second item of the resolution of this association on calculating wages in silver dollars clearly stipulates that when factories pay wages to employees, if they do not have silver dollars, they should convert them into gold yuan notes at the market price on the day, and employees shall not refuse. It is sufficient to prove that the method of calculating wages in silver dollars suggested by this association does not involve the issue of the gold yuan note's monetary standard and has nothing to do with the Central Bank's possession of silver dollars. The news report may have some misunderstandings, so I hereby declare the above again."</p>

<h3>Lai Puhan, Deputy Director of the Economic Cooperation Agency, Flew to Shanghai</h3>

<h3>The National Products Manufacturers Association Cables to the Acting President, Requesting the Issuance of Fully Prepared Silver Dollar Notes</h3>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Association telegraphed to Acting President Li, President He, and Minister of Finance Liu yesterday on the currency system, saying: "It has been found that the gold yuan note has depreciated continuously and has no end in sight, which has led to soaring prices. Although the Central Bank has sold gold, silver, foreign exchange, and materials, it still cannot stop the competition between interest chasing profits and profits chasing interest. In terms of currency, although the gold yuan note is an infinitely legal currency, the actual pricing unit is gold, U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, silver dollars, customs dollars, and public utility base numbers. The gold yuan note has become a subsidiary coin and is inferior to others. Considering human nature, for the sake of value preservation and storage, people mostly go to silver dollars. It can be said that what the people like is silver dollars, and what the people hate is gold yuan notes, which is undoubtedly the case. Under this situation, it is difficult to avoid repeating the mistakes of August 19 last year if we speak lightly about reforming the currency system. However, weighing the situation and considering the reasons, it is imperative to use silver dollars as the unit for calculating wages. At the same time, based on the full preparation of gold, silver, and foreign exchange, issue silver dollar notes for circulation and carrying, and use them together with gold yuan notes as infinitely legal currencies, so that industry and commerce can easily operate, social life can be slightly stabilized, and the mutual competition between interest and profit can be slightly weakened, and the economic crisis can be slightly averted. I hereby submit this by telegram, hoping to hear your instructions."</p>

<h3>The Wounded and Dead Soldiers of the Two British Warships Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday in Two Batches: The Hull of the Arriving Partner Ship Showed No External Damage</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Soldiers who were killed and wounded when the British warships Amethyst and Partner were shelled by the Communist army in the Yangtze River arrived in Shanghai in two batches yesterday. In the morning, the Partner brought 10 dead, 15 seriously injured, and 12 slightly injured. In the afternoon, the 5th train on the Beijing-Shanghai line brought one seriously injured and four slightly injured, all of whom were sent to Hongen Hospital on Zhongzheng West Road for treatment. More than 50 uninjured officers and soldiers from the Amethyst also came to Shanghai on the train. They were in a very difficult situation, mostly wearing only undershirts and shorts, and draped in the yellow cotton military uniforms of the National Army soldiers.</p>
<p>The Partner fought with the Communist army's shore artillery for two hours. There was no external damage to the hull, but the interior was in a mess. The Communist army's artillery fire came from 105mm guns, machine guns, and direct-firing guns. According to the personnel on the ship, they returned fire more than 300 rounds and believed that they had destroyed eight Communist army artillery fires and killed about 60 Communist army soldiers. Later, the ship's rangefinder room was destroyed, the engine room was also hit, the steering wheel was damaged, and the helmsman was killed, so they managed to drive to Jiangyin and anchor with great difficulty, and then continued to Shanghai. The ship originally had seven British flags. Unless the Communist army did not recognize the British flag, they would not know that it was a British warship.</p>
<p>The Bodies of the Dead Soldiers Will Be Buried Today</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The bodies of the 10 dead soldiers from the Partner who were transported to Shanghai yesterday were sent to the International Funeral Home for embalming and will be buried at Hongqiao Cemetery at 2:30 pm today. A memorial prayer will be held at Trinity Church on Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>[United Press Shanghai 21st] Fifty-nine soldiers from the stranded British warship Amethyst escaped and arrived here by train this afternoon. According to Officer Hayes, at least 20 sailors were killed on the ship, the captain was seriously injured, and another 34 sailors were injured.</p>
<p>The Shanghai British Naval Authorities Issued a Statement</p>
<p>[British Information Office This City News] The British Naval Authorities stationed in Shanghai issued the following statement at 7:00 pm (21st): The British warship Amethyst reported again by radio last night (20th) at 10:00 pm that the ship's personnel are doing their best to repair the damaged areas so that it can re-float. It is said that 60 of the crew members have left the ship and gone to a large town nearby because they were unable to return to the ship through the mine-laying area at night. Four of them were injured. According to reports, the Communist army continuously fired on the ship with medium-sized artillery fire until noon, and sporadic artillery fire did not stop until the afternoon. As a result, about 17 crew members were killed and about 20 were injured. Therefore, most of the crew members were forced to temporarily leave the ship to avoid greater casualties, but by the evening, those who were able to return to the ship had all returned to the ship. A report was received at 6:15 am this morning that the Amethyst had repaired itself late last night and had now re-floated. It was also reported that the Partner departed from Nanjing at 11:50 am yesterday and drove downstream at full speed until it saw the Amethyst also sending a signal to notify the Partner to turn around and retreat to avoid artillery fire. However, the Partner thought it was safer to continue forward at full speed. After the artillery fire subsided, it was two miles downstream from the Amethyst before turning back to the Amethyst to approach and pull, but it was forced to retreat due to the fierce artillery fire and continued to drive downstream. On the way, it was attacked by active artillery fire from Penzhu Island (Xuewen Island). Most of the casualties of the ship were suffered at this time. The helmsman was killed, and the driving engine could not be used for a while. The crew members died. A total of nine people were killed and three were seriously injured. The ship had effectively fought back with all its weapons. In addition, measures have been taken to send medical aid from Hong Kong by the Royal Air Force Sander Gate seaplane.</p>
<p>Officer of the Amethyst Talks About the Experience</p>
<p>[Reuters This City News] Fifty-nine British sailors and four Chinese cooks from the British warship Amethyst arrived in Shanghai from Changzhou by train at 4:00 pm today. After leaving the ship, they swam to the shore under artillery fire, and then walked seven miles to Changzhou. National Army soldiers tried their best to take care of them along the way. Most of the people who arrived in Shanghai were wearing yellow cloth cotton military uniforms, which were allocated to them by the National Army. Everyone was extremely tired. Some were bandaged, some were carried off the train on stretchers because of injuries, some were barefoot, and some were wearing slippers. They were in a very difficult situation. British and American naval personnel took care of them at the station. After getting off the train, they went to the British Consulate to rest temporarily, and then moved to the British Overseas Chinese residence in Shanghai to stay temporarily. According to Mr. Heath, the leading officer among them, he told reporters that the crew members were ordered to prepare to respond at 8:30 am yesterday. At about 9:00 am, several artillery shells passed by, but did not touch the hull, but the artillery on the shore continued to fire. The helm room and the ship's tower were hit first, and the captain and several others were hit by bullets. The situation was chaotic afterwards, and the hull soon ran aground, and the steering rudder also malfunctioned. At that time, the shore was still firing artillery fire, and the crew members decided that if the Communist personnel tried to board the ship, they would resist with rifles, so they distributed rifles to each member. However, the Amethyst was hit by artillery shells again, and the resistance plan was finally abandoned. Captain Robertson, who had been injured, was hit by a bullet in a corner of the hull and ordered two white flags to be raised. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party seemed to be color blind and continued to fire artillery fire. Then he lowered the ladder, and Heath and his party swam 200 yards to the island. The Communist army still did not let go and swept the water with machine guns, and there were continued deaths and injuries. The Chinese on the island pointed out the path where no landmines were laid. After walking for half an hour, they encountered the National Army firing signal guns, so the Chinese cook on the ship swam to the National Army position on the other side and sent a small boat to pick them up across the river. Led by an officer, they walked seven miles and then changed to three trucks and arrived in Changzhou at 5:00 am this morning. After arriving in Changzhou, a National Army major personally took care of them and contacted the railway bureau to arrange a special train to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Comforting Officers and Soldiers of the Yongxiang Warship: Representatives Sent Today to Present a Flag</h3>

A small number of officers and soldiers on board were also injured. The warship has now been recalled to Shanghai for rest, allowing the injured officers and soldiers to recuperate in peace. The Shanghai municipal committee for comforting the troops, recognizing the warship's outstanding contributions in defending the river, has specially requested Committee Member Xu Mingya to represent the committee at 3:00 PM today, to take a "National Hero" banner and some comfort goods to the naval dock to express their respect and comfort to the officers and soldiers on board.</p>

<h3>Socialite Accidentally Kills Adopted Daughter: Corpse-in-Suitcase Case Cracked on Julu Road</h3>
<p>Xu Qin Fang Confesses Her Crime After Arrest</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] On the morning of the 9th of this month, a discarded yellow old leather suitcase was discovered at the entrance of Lane 556, Julu Road. After the patrolling police brought it back to the Jing'an Temple branch of the Public Security Bureau, an examination revealed a horrifying sight: the corpse of a girl, approximately four years old, covered in bruises. The body was wrapped in cotton, indicating that she had been severely beaten to death before being discarded. The chief of the Fifth Branch reported the case to the Criminal Division of the General Bureau. Division Chief Zheng Tingxian ordered Fifth Section Chief Yao Kai-Ru, Section Officer Wu Liangqian, and Senior Officer Sun Shilin to work with judicial officers from the Jing'an Temple branch to investigate, and the case has now been solved. The perpetrator is a well-known socialite named Xu Qinfang, who was arrested at 6:00 AM yesterday. Following the incident, police officers investigated the scene and determined that</p>
<p>the location of the crime was not far away. Thus, they began a door-to-door household investigation. Soon, Xu Qinfang, the resident of No. 7, Lane 6, Xiangyang North Road, became a prime suspect. Xu's household registration showed two daughters and one maid: one daughter named Wenhua, and the maid, Wang Ma. During the investigation, the girl was not seen, and Xu appeared extremely flustered. However, lacking sufficient evidence, the officers remained calm, but secretly monitored her movements. The following day, Xu left home and did not return, entrusting all household affairs to a female friend. On the third day, Xu went alone to the Wenyong Shou Nunnery on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei to pray for the deceased. Afterwards, she would return home briefly every three to five days, then leave again. By this time, the police had learned from neighbors that the girl had disappeared the night before the incident. Xu's erratic behavior further aroused suspicion. Eventually, they found a way to contact her maid, Wang Ma, and after questioning, she</p>
<p>revealed the truth, bringing the case to light. It was discovered that the deceased girl was actually Xu's adopted daughter, named Wenhua, aged four. When she was adopted (at only one year old), Xu loved her as if she were her own child. However, in recent years, due to financial difficulties, Xu's temperament became volatile, and she often beat the girl. In particular, on the morning of the 6th of this month, the girl had an accident and was severely beaten. On the morning of the 8th, the girl had another accident, leading to another brutal beating, which resulted in her being thrown from the bed, causing fatal injuries. Fearing punishment, Xu placed the body in an old suitcase, wrapped it in cotton, and instructed the maid to take it out and dispose of it in the suburbs late at night. However, halfway there, fearing scrutiny, the maid abandoned the suitcase at the entrance of Lane 556, Julu Road. Upon receiving this information, the police secretly dispatched detectives to watch the house around the clock. At 6:00 AM yesterday, Xu returned and was promptly</p>
<p>arrested and taken to the station, where she confessed everything under interrogation. Xu is thirty years old and a native of Ningbo. In her statement, she recounted her life story, saying that she had received no education in her youth. At the age of fourteen, she followed her father to North China to engage in commerce. At eighteen, she married a wealthy merchant in Tianjin, but they divorced shortly after due to differences. At twenty-four, she came to Shanghai alone and opened a room at the Jinmen Hotel. She once worked as a dance hostess, and later became a socialite, frequenting various social venues, where she met a certain well-known figure in the city. They became intimate and initially rented a house together in Lafayette Terrace on Fuxing Middle Road. Later, she returned to No. 7, Lane 6, Xiangyang North Road. Recently, the well-known figure had lost interest and stopped visiting, causing her financial distress. Deeply frustrated, her temper became volatile, leading to the accidental killing.</p>

<h3>Ancient Tomb Outside the South Gate of Changzhou: First Stage of Excavation uncovers Chamber of Burial Goods</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Li Tianhang</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Wujin, 20th] Inadvertently, during construction of fortifications, a certain Yun family in Qinglong Bridge just outside the south gate of our county discovered an ancient tomb. The unusual style of its bricks and the tomb door’s unique construction have caused it to be rumored near and far, and archaeologists from the Beijing-Shanghai area have come to Changzhou to inspect it one after another, all agreeing that it has value in excavation. Following a local recommendation, the county government invited representatives from all sectors to organize an excavation committee. Just as they prepared to excavate, they suddenly received a directive from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating that according to the regulations on ancient tomb excavations, it should be overseen by an academic institution above the provincial or municipal level, and local authorities should not excavate it arbitrarily. The province then sent a telegram to invite the Shanghai Tongji University and Shanghai Municipal Museum to oversee the matter. Subsequently, Mr. Jiang Dayi of Tongji University, Yang Kuan, Director of the Municipal Museum, Zeng Zhaoyì of the Central Museum and other Shanghai representatives negotiated with local figures, deciding that because the ancient tomb had already been exposed to the surface by the construction of fortifications, the work would be a cleaning and tidying operation, rather than an excavation. Therefore, the excavation committee was renamed the Ancient Ruined Tomb Cleaning and Preservation Committee. The county government appointed known academics such as Jiang Weiyi, experts like Jiang Dayi and Yang Kuan, as well as local figures. Tongji University and the Shanghai Municipal Museum were tasked with submitting the work for registration, field clearing, and academic research. Local authorities would be responsible for maintaining order and providing supplies. It was decided that all excavated cultural relics would be entrusted to the local authorities for safekeeping. With the agreements in place, work gradually began.</p>
<p>As soon as things got underway, trouble arose everywhere. The field workers' location, accommodation, food, and work, all required a lot of preparation and arrangement. Finally, Wang Peiqin, the principal of Qinglong Bridge Elementary School, lent a hand by providing the auditorium as a workspace. The township head, Pin Fuchang, helped by finding workers, borrowing tools, and building fences. The preliminary work was quite a bother.</p>
<p>On the 13th, Mr. Yang Yourun rushed to Qinglong Bridge early in the morning. On the 14th, Jiang Dayi of Tongji University arrived with two technicians, all enthusiastic. The clearing officially began on the 15th. Workers were first employed to remove the accumulated soil in front of the ancient tomb. One hoe, one hoe, one load of mud, one load of mud at a time, on the first day, the foundation of a tomb that had been completely dug out by villagers taking bricks was rediscovered. The length, width, and height were roughly determined. Work was delayed by a spring rain that fell all day on the 17th. On the 18th and 19th, the bottom of the ancient tomb was dug to. Under the loose soil, broken ancient coins and shattered ironware were found. Most of the coins were wuzhu coins, some green with copper rust, some quite complete, some fragmented and difficult to collect. The ironware was also in a decayed state, unlikely to be salvaged. These have now been collected and preserved by the field workers! The area around the ancient tomb has now been enclosed by bamboo fences, and the city defense department has posted a notice prohibiting all visits during the work period. As for the work inside the tomb, as of this writing, it has not yet started and will likely be possible to enter in a day or two.</p>
<p>As the fieldwork unfolded, Jiang Dayi and Mr. Yang Yourun, about five or six zhang to the north of the tomb that was first discovered, that is, directly above the Yun family pier, on the north wall of a deep pit dug out for city defense works, noticed that the bricks were neatly laid. Mr. Jiang and Mr. Yang believed that there was something there, so they assigned one or two workers to excavate there. After digging in only five or six chi, they discovered another pit, full of bottles, large and small, six or seven of which became visible! The objects of the investigation intensified their enthusiasm. Six bottles were taken out, and there were still bottles below, seven, eight, more than ten… until more than ten were excavated on the 19th, continuing until after 2:00 a.m., but there were still many bottles to be excavated. A portion of bronzeware has already been discovered, and for the sake of careful work, it was temporarily stopped, with the area still covered with a board door and sealed with mud. In the early morning of the 20th, a bamboo fence was erected around this area as well, and it was decided that a detailed cleaning would be carried out on the 21st. Mr. Jiang, Mr. Yang, and local figures are all very excited, as another ancient tomb has been discovered.</p>
<p>The ancient tomb pit is completely filled with burial objects. According to the usual practice of Han, Wei, and Jin ancient tombs, there is often a separate chamber for storing utensils. This chamber is undoubtedly a storage room for burial goods. The bricks of the tomb have no patterns, unlike the bricks of the first tomb, which also indicates that these must be two tombs, not from the same family. The burial goods that have been unearthed (before the 20th) are all pottery. The largest one is about one chi five or six cun high and one chi two or three cun wide.</p>
<p>The patterns are extremely beautiful. The upper half is monochrome light yellow oil paint with black brush lines. The mouth of the bottle is decorated with overlapping herringbone patterns, delicate and uniform. A bunch of patterns adorns the neck of the bottle as well. Three lines encircle the bottle’s shoulder and body. In the upper two bands of space, there are patterns of flying birds and harmony. Simple and interesting. The lower half is dark purple in color without oil glaze. There are two rings on the bottle’s shoulder. Tiger hoof feet. Very elaborate. One side of the bottle mouth is broken, full of mud (see picture). The other is a huge shape, about one chi two or three cun high and wide, taking a round shape, most of the upper part is painted with oil glaze, light tea yellow in color. Decorated with overlapping horizontal lines, and vertically with small groups of vertical lines, staggered up and down, the pattern is also simple and lovely. The lower half has no oil glaze, and the color is like mud. This is complete and undamaged, and the inside is all real soil. There are eight or nine other small ones, similar in shape to the big ones, only smaller. There are horizontal lines interspersed with lines on the body. One color is all red, and the other is sauce color. The sizes are also slightly different (see picture). According to informal sources, these kinds of things are generally from the period of the Six Dynasties. The unearthed s have been brought to the county party headquarters, one by one, for safekeeping, to be studied in detail. It seems that there are too few research staff.</p>
<p>The unearthed pottery from the Yun family pier outside Changzhou South Gate: (Top) Approximately one chi five or six cun high, and over one chi wide. (Middle) Approximately five cun high. (Bottom) Approximately one chi high, and over nine cun wide. (Drawn by our reporter Li Tianhang)</p>
<h3>Important Town in Sichuan: Jianyang - The City of Tobacco and Sugar</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent, Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chengdu, 17th of this month] American tobacco is a newly emerging specialty of Sichuan during wartime. Jianyang, the American tobacco capital of Sichuan, is famous throughout the country, rivaling Xuchang in Henan. Jianyang—with Longquan Mountain as its left pillow and the Tuo River as its right belt—boasts flourishing commerce and abundant specialties. It is an important newly emerging city in Sichuan this year. With a gentle spring breeze, I, the reporter, took advantage of a ride to this town, known as the essence of Sichuan's specialties, to see firsthand the current state of production, transportation, and sales of tobacco and sugar specialties.</p>
<p>The Prosperity of Shiqiao in Jianyang is Typical</p>
<p>Jianyang is over two hundred li east of Chengdu. Its waterways are connected to the Tuo River, reaching Jintang to the north and Luxian to the south. Land routes serve as the throat of Chengdu and Chongqing, heading west to Ya'an and east to Wanxian. Leaving Chengdu East Station and crossing Longquan Mountain, you arrive at Shiqiao, the largest town in Jianyang. This is the main water and land terminal in central Sichuan. The exchange of goods between southwestern and northeastern Sichuan takes place here. It is densely populated and the market is prosperous. Education is developed, with twenty-one middle schools and nearly one hundred primary schools. Specialties include American tobacco, sugar, salt, and cotton. The streets in the town are wide and the buildings are neatly arranged. Boats and vehicles are like clouds, and factories stand in rows, creating a scene that is no less impressive than a major county in Jiangnan. Forty li west of Shiqiao is Jianyang City, which is the first important gateway to Chengdu from the east. The Chengdu-Chongqing and Luxi (　) highways intersect. The urban area is magnificent and grand, with numerous new and old factories. The county spans over one hundred square kilometers and has a population of over one million. Half of the residents are tobacco or sugarcane farmers, or workers in sugar factories or salt fields. The rest are mostly tobacco merchants or those involved in the transportation and sale of goods. The reasons for the prosperity of this small town are: firstly, the development of emerging rural industries—such as the export of American tobacco, sugar, and salt; and secondly, convenient transportation. Specialties from northwestern Sichuan, such as tobacco leaves from Jintang and Shifang, and mountain goods from Zhongba and Jiangyou, are all handled here. Its economic position in Sichuan, apart from major ports such as Chengdu, Chongqing, and Wanxian, is arguably second to none.</p>
<p>Production and Sales of the Tobacco Capital</p>
<p>As a special product of Kaiyang, American tobacco has a short history. Although successful trial cultivation has only been around for a few years, its superior varieties and early market appearance (about three months earlier than the rest of the country) have allowed it to catch up and surpass others, selling throughout the country, reaching Beijing and Shanghai in the east, and Guangdong and Guangxi in the south. In total, the county has over 1.4 million mu of tobacco fields, with an annual output of about 160,000 dan. Quality: The leaves are wide, even, and thin, with fine veins, golden color, and a refreshing aroma, making them top-grade among American tobaccos in the country. Cultivation: Seeds are sown in early spring, using bean cake as fertilizer, mixed into the soil of the tobacco fields. After plowing, earthen ridges are built, and then the tobacco seedlings are transplanted. By summer, tobacco plants are formed, and they can be harvested after a short period. Sales: The quality of Jianyang American tobacco is comparable to imported products, with sales extending overseas. Every harvest season, famous cigarette factories in Shanghai and Guangzhou send specialists to Jianyang to purchase tobacco. Local tobacco merchants also have warehouses throughout the country. Transportation to Shanghai and Guangzhou follows the Chengdu-Chongqing highway, transferring to ships in Chongqing to go east. To the northwest, it is transported via the Sichuan-Shaanxi highway to Xi'an and Lanzhou. Within the province, most of the transportation is done by boats and vehicles to various counties. In addition, there are several modern cigarette factories in Jianyang City and Shiqiao. Larger ones have their own drying rooms and nurseries, and manufacture cigarettes by machine. Smaller ones are purely handmade cigarettes. Due to their low cost and excellent quality, sales are very high and demand exceeds supply. Currently, the sales of various brands are limited to the northwestern Sichuan area.</p>
<p>Production and Sales of Sugar, Cotton, and Salt</p>
<p>In addition to American tobacco, Jianyang's specialties also include sugar, salt, and cotton. In Sichuan, Neijiang, Zizhong, and Shiqiao are all renowned for sugar production. Shiqiao alone has 854 sugar houses, and the county has about 200,000 mu of sugarcane fields, with an annual output of over 45 million kilograms, second only to Neijiang and Zizhong. Unfortunately, Jianyang's sugar production is stuck in old-fashioned ways. It is difficult to find a modern sugar factory in Shiqiao. The sugar-making process: The first step is for the sugar houses to press sugarcane into juice and boil it into sugar syrup. The second step is to process and refine it in the "leaking sheds" to produce refined sugar. The process relies entirely on stone mills, iron pots, earthen vats, mud, and pressure, plus the experience of "sugar-boiling masters" to create sugar. This represents three stages of the sugar industry: sugarcane farmers, "leaking sheds," and sugar houses. Limited by old habits and unwilling to change, despite Jianyang's mild climate, progress is still slow. In terms of sales, the sugar is collected in Shiqiao and transported to northern Sichuan, mainly to the northwest, especially the Shaanxi and Gansu areas, which largely rely on Jianyang sugar for supply. In addition, Jianyang's salt has over eighty salt wells in the county, with an annual output of 3.4 million kilograms. However, due to the outdated production methods, the salt quality is not excellent. The production method: "Well households" dig salt wells and extract brine. "Aqueduct households" transport the brine to be boiled. "Stove households" are responsible for manufacturing, boiling the water into salt. This represents three stages of Jianyang salt production. The salt is divided into "flower salt" and "Ba salt." Flower salt is white and granular. Ba salt is black and solidified into blocks. Sales are divided into "wall merchants" and "traveling merchants." Wall merchants specialize in mediation, while traveling merchants transport and sell. Jianyang salt is part of the northern Sichuan salt field and is designated for sale in Chengdu and surrounding provinces. Cotton: The county has about 750,000 mu of cotton fields, with an annual output of over 20 million kilograms, which is transported and sold to southwestern Sichuan.</p>
<p>American tobacco, sugar, salt, and cotton constitute the prosperity of Jianyang and represent the wealth of the Land of Abundance. Here, there are vast green fields of endless tobacco, interspersed with dense sugarcane forests, towering chimneys, and numerous wells and stoves. This place contains boundless wealth and resources. Building Jianyang is the prelude to building Sichuan. After visiting Jianyang, I indeed felt a sense of optimism about the future of Sichuan's development.</p>
<h3>Agricultural and Forestry Undertakings in Guizhou Province: "Facing the Yellow Earth, Back to the Sky" - Strengthening the Development of Ground Production</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent, Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guiyang, 17th of this month] The impoverished Guizhou province relies on central government allocations for over 96% of its annual provincial budget. In today's situation of empty national coffers and ever-growing fiscal deficits, not only does the central government find it difficult to bear, but Chairman Gu Zhenglun and the Guizhou provincial people's representative bodies also believe that this is a crisis that will inevitably arrive one day. Under these circumstances, both the central and local governments require Guizhou to quickly strive for economic development, believing that self-reliance through diligence is the only way to overcome the fiscal crisis.</p>
<p>When discussing economic development in Guizhou, whether it be industry or commerce, historical and economic conditions are insufficient, so no matter how much effort is put into "reviving all undertakings," it is definitely impossible to achieve the ideal state of self-sufficiency and surplus exports within three to five years. In the short term, the only economic development undertaking that can "yield results immediately," make up for the difference between provincial fiscal revenue and expenditure, and allow the people to enjoy the fruits of their labor is to develop ground production, in other words, to encourage the eleven million people to further strengthen their "facing the yellow earth, back to the sky" efforts in agricultural and forestry undertakings.</p>
<p>However, given Guizhou's limitations in climate and soil, and the large number of agricultural and forestry projects, undertaking them one by one would be beyond the capacity of the current manpower and financial resources of each county, and would also be limited by the natural environment, ultimately leading to wasted effort. Last year, the Guizhou Provincial Government stipulated that in addition to the production of food crops suitable for universal development in each county, which should be universally carried out by each county, and efforts should be made to adopt methods such as reclaiming wasteland, selecting improved varieties, and paying attention to fertilization in order to achieve self-sufficiency, for crops with economic value, each county should select one or two items that are endowed with unique conditions, suitable for the natural environment, and within the reach of manpower and financial resources, and work together to achieve practical results. In particular, it is hoped that attention will be paid to tung oil, rapeseed oil, and American tobacco, which are commonly planted in the province and yield substantial profits, as the focus of efforts, with the aim of using the production of American tobacco to offset the salt supply from Shanghai, and exporting tung oil and rapeseed oil to exchange for foreign currency, cloth, and other goods.</p>
<p>Regarding the cultivation of American tobacco, since its introduction and promotion in Guizhou, it has achieved results and has become a common cultivation phenomenon in various counties. However, due to the tobacco seeds being introduced for too long, the purity has been lost, resulting in a decline in quality, making it impossible to continue planting. The relevant departments of the provincial government have stipulated that starting from the 38th year, the entire province will universally replace seeds, and the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Politics will massively propagate the Special Character No. 400 tobacco seeds that have been effectively promoted in Guizhou in previous years, and distribute them to each county in a timely and sufficient manner. In addition, with the approval of the Tobacco Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, a large batch of 2,000 city catties of pure Fuguang seeds were transported to Guizhou and distributed to tobacco farmers in each county at a price of one corner of gold yuan per gram for universal replacement. As of now, a total of over 7,900 city catties of Special Character No. 400 tobacco seeds and over 1,450 city catties of Fuguang tobacco seeds have been promoted. More than eight city catties of pure seeds that Dean He Jingzhi used in the United States last year are also continuing to be promoted. According to the estimate of the Provincial Department of Construction, the actual harvest of American tobacco in Guizhou Province in the 37th year is about 500,000 city dan, most of which have been transported and sold outside the province, and the tobacco farmers have made substantial profits. Although the cultivation and production increase of American tobacco in Guizhou Province has achieved great results in recent years, tobacco farmers are not familiar with the technical work of baking, grading, and packaging, and some are even short-sighted and engage in various unethical behaviors, affecting export reputation and causing significant losses to tobacco farmers. Last winter, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Politics established an American Tobacco Technology Training Class, transferring and training agricultural technicians from various counties, providing short-term professional training in American tobacco, with a total of over 90 graduates, who were assigned to continue their work in various counties. The Guangxi Provincial Government also sent seven students to the class for training, and the results were satisfactory. At the same time, the Guizhou Enterprise Company set up collection sites in Guiyang and Guiding, strictly engaged in grading and packaging, etc., to show advocacy and take advantage of the sales reputation. Since its implementation, it has achieved considerable results. The Tobacco Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also sent personnel to Guizhou last winter to assist due to the vast area of American tobacco cultivation in the province and its great future development. The Guizhou Tobacco Improvement Farm has now been established in Guiyang, and recently a rural supervision group has been jointly formed with the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Politics to go to various counties and districts to actually supervise the sowing and fertilization of American tobacco. Rapeseed is one of Guizhou's economic crops, and rapeseed oil is an important export product of the province. If production can be actively increased and exports can be purchased as much as possible to exchange for foreign exchange, it can not only increase rural income, but also make up for the province's fiscal deficit. Therefore, the Guizhou Provincial Government has designated the promotion of rapeseed as the central task of each county and city, assigning technical personnel to go to each county and township to earnestly guide farmers to use winter fallow land to plant in large quantities without hindering the principle of increasing food crop production. At the same time, it has also formulated assessment methods for increasing rapeseed production in each county and city, in order to strengthen the promotion of this work. During the period when warlords controlled Guizhou, farmers in each county and township were ordered to plant the opium drug that harmed the country and the people in winter. To this day, there are remnants of this poison left everywhere. The provincial government also ordered the anti-smoking supervisors to go to each county and township to supervise the ban on planting and eradication, and at the same time, to urge the county governments to intensify publicity and plant a large number of rapeseed crops that are beneficial to the country and the people. At present, the farmers in each county and township are generally able to abide by this purpose. This is also a wise measure to replace destruction with construction and to drive out bad policies with good policies. According to the report of the Provincial Department of Construction, the total rapeseed production in Guizhou Province in the 37th year is estimated to be over 1.5 million city dan, 19 of which are exported to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the past pressing of rapeseed has mostly followed the local method, resulting in Poor oil yield affects exports, which should be improved in order to expand export markets. The Provincial Department of Construction ordered Guizhou Enterprise Company last winter to set up a machine oil pressing factory in Zunyi first to show advocacy and improvement. The new oil pressing machine purchased by the company in Chongqing has now been transported to Zunyi for installation. After the factory building is completed, it can start work by June of this year at the latest.</p>
<p>Most of the vehicles leaving Guiyang to the south are transporting tung oil out of the country, and those who pay attention to the Guiyang market quotations first pay attention to the daily tung oil opening price. The reason is very simple, because tung trees are distributed throughout the province in Guizhou. According to the survey and research of the China Agricultural Research Institute, the tung tree cultivation area in Guizhou Province in the 36th year was about 400,000 city mu, and the tung oil harvest reached more than 260,000 city dan. In recent years, Chairman Gu Zhenglun has always encouraged the people of the province to increase the production of tung oil in this province to exchange for cotton cloth from Hunan and Guangdong, and hopes to plant 50,000 tung trees in the province within three years as the highest ideal, and the speed of production increase can be imagined. The Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute has specially proposed in the work plan that all counties suitable for planting tung trees should adopt the principle of planting tung trees as a means of moving forests. According to the report, the number of tung trees planted in the 37th year in the Wujiang River Basin, a famous tung-producing area in Guizhou, such as Xiuwen, Yanhe, Sinan, and other 12 counties, and other counties suitable for tung trees, is estimated to have reached more than 20,000.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in January of this year, the Guizhou Provincial Products Transportation and Sales Company has mainly focused on tung oil in its exchange and transportation work with Guangdong. More than 1,000 tons have been transported to Guangzhou, and another 500 tons are waiting for the Guangdong Provincial Material Adjustment Committee to resume work before they are loaded and shipped. The 7,000 dan of salt and a large number of telecommunications equipment transported back to Guizhou from Guangdong Province are all injected and exchanged from tung oil trade. The economic value of this is not difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>In addition to American tobacco, rapeseed, and tung oil, which are the most famous economic crops, the climate and soil of the lower reaches of the Hongshui River, Chishui River, Nanpan River, Beipan River, Wujiang River, Jisui River, and Dujiang River in Guizhou Province are all suitable for planting cotton. Since the promotion of planting in the 28th year, the annual output has gradually increased. However, due to the central government's cessation of subsidies last year, the funds were not available, resulting in a failure to substantially improve the promotion policy. The Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute prepared a large number of excellent cotton seeds and massively promoted them in the 38th year. At the same time, it formulated cotton planting precautions and distributed them to each suitable cotton county to widely publicize and urge farmers to plant a large number of cotton in suitable cotton areas in order to gradually achieve self-sufficiency and solve the problem of clothing raw materials in the province. The cotton seeds required by each county are now being prepared by the Shibing Cotton Farm in this province at 10,000 city catties, and 40,000 catties of excellent Xiang-produced De and Tuo cotton seeds are being purchased from Hunan and distributed to suitable cotton counties for promotion, and are now being actively processed. Guizhou's agriculture has a glorious and brilliant future with the unified efforts of all levels. However, due to the 75% self-defense special donation for foreign exports, internal traitors are causing trouble, and they are calling on the rural fools to arm themselves and plant tobacco in the remote areas at any time, so the problem of public security has not yet been ideally resolved, and there are still many difficulties. Recently, due to the convening of the 7th session of the 1st Guizhou Provincial Assembly, some provincial senators secretly weighed the current situation and the current situation in the province, advocating considering whether banning smoking and governing the character are "the first" thing. This is really a major turning point in the future. Because the province's finances are really exhausted, and the central government's assistance is slow, and the security problem is becoming more and more serious. In order to "put out the fire first," Guizhou may have to re-evaluate the anti-drug policy. If so, the agricultural and forestry undertakings in Guizhou may suffer a major setback in the future. This method of drinking poison to quench thirst depends on whether the authorities have the courage to weigh it.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Kuomintang Statement on the CCP's "Domestic Peace Agreement" - Hoping that the Communist Party will Turn Back from the Brink and Immediately Issue a Ceasefire Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th] The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang passed a statement on the so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" of the Chinese Communist Party on the 20th. It is said that it was immediately telegraphed to Acting President Li and President He. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Statement of the Chinese Kuomintang on the So-Called "Domestic Peace Agreement" of the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, regarding the eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the "Domestic Peace Agreement" proposed by the Chinese Communist Party, hereby makes the following solemn statement to all compatriots in the country:</p>
<p>1. The damage suffered by our compatriots across the country due to the turmoil caused by the Chinese Communist Party over the past twenty years is actually greater than the damage caused to our country and people by the Japanese invasion, or even greater than that. However, since the government advocated peace, it has endured humiliation and borne heavy burdens, and has not yet discussed the issue of responsibility for the internal turmoil, originally hoping to express sincerity and inspire peace. In fact, after leading the country to complete unification in 1928, we should have devoted ourselves to national construction, which could have been restored long ago. It was only because the CCP constantly launched rebellions, destroying the unification that the people of the country longed for, that the great cause of national construction was obstructed. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, on September 22, 1937, the CCP declared four points to the country: (1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are necessary for China today, and the CCP is willing to strive for their thorough realization; (2) Cancel all riot policies and red movement policies that overthrow the Chinese Kuomintang regime, and stop the policy of forcibly confiscating the land of landlords; (3) Abolish the Soviet government, implement civil rights politics, in order to unify the national power; (4) Abolish the name of the Red Army and reorganize it into the National Revolutionary Army, subject to the command of the Military Committee of the National Government. Our party originally hoped that the CCP would repent and jointly devote itself to the War of Resistance and national construction. However, before long, it broke its promise again, harassed everywhere, and repeatedly raised troops. If it were not for the tolerance and magnanimity of our government, the War of Resistance would have been destroyed halfway, and the national lifeline would have been cut off without leaving any residue. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we should have sought the rehabilitation of the people, without remembering old grievances, and first advocated peace, convened the Political Consultative Conference, formulated a peace plan, and convened the National Assembly based on the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference to formulate the Constitution of the Republic of China, seeking domestic peace and unity, in order to implement civil rights advocacy and establish a democratic government. However, the CCP has always insisted on its strategy of seizing power by force. In the past two or three years, it has constantly launched widespread internal turmoil, resulting in countless lives and properties sacrificed by our people in the eight-year War of Resistance. The fruits of victory, the international glorious position, the free life of the people, and the achievements of the national revolution led by the Father of the Nation over the past fifty years have all suffered ruthless losses. All these obvious facts are known to the people of the country. If it were not for the CCP's attempt to blame the responsibility for the civil war on our central government in the preamble of its so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement," our party would have been able to endure all internal and external slanders for the sake of ending the war and seeking peace. However, since the CCP has so distorted the facts, trying to cover up the eyes and ears of the world, our party cannot accept a responsibility that completely violates the truth for the sake of justice, truth, and the history of future generations.</p>
<p>2. The eight articles and twenty-four clauses proposed by the CCP, according to their content, completely lose the nature of agreed peace clauses, but are a cruel punishment and slaughter of the people and government of our Republic of China. The purpose of the CCP's proposal this time is only to establish a one-party dictatorship of the Communist Party, destroying the democratic constitutionalism that our party has been committed to promoting over the years. It has not considered the people's demands for peace and the guarantee of free life and stability, but has only trapped the entire country and people in its iron curtain, following the example of Poland and Czechoslovakia. Therefore, in order to safeguard the independence of the country and the freedom of the people, the CCP should discuss and revise the peace clauses in accordance with the principles proposed in our party's statement on the 18th of this month.</p>
<p>In January of the 35th year of the Republic of China, when the National Government convened a legitimate consultative conference, the CCP stated that before the peace talks were held, both sides must issue a ceasefire order, otherwise it should be regarded as a sign of no sincerity in the peace talks and refuse to participate in the meeting. Before the first gathering of the consultations, a ceasefire order was issued. At this critical moment of peace, our party still hopes that the CCP will turn back from the brink and immediately issue a ceasefire order, so that the nationwide people's eagerly awaited peace talks will not be interrupted, and a comprehensive and permanent peace can be achieved. Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, April 20, 38th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Touching the Ancients of Three Dynasties, Wearing the Mud of Six Dynasties - Ming Artifacts Unearthed in Changzhou, Jiang Dayi Writes Couplets to Describe Himself</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Wujin, 20th] A newly discovered ancient tomb in Yunjia Dun has recently contributed countless archaeological data. See our special report for details. Mr. Jiang Dayi is in a happy mood, and his face is full of smiles in the spring breeze. "Touching the ancients of three dynasties, wearing the mud of six dynasties." This is a couplet he proudly wrote to describe himself. Today, he told the reporter, pointing to the mud stains on his clothes, and said, "Isn't this the mud of the Six Dynasties?" However, he had a very hard night last night.</p>
<p>During the short working process, some professors from Tongji University came together to take many photos. Secretary-General Xu Daolin of the Provincial Government and Commissioner Hu Tieming of the Sui District Administrative Office also visited the tomb.</p>
<h3>Secretary of the Wuxi County Government Watching Free Plays - The Storm Has Eased and is Expected to be Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Wuxi, 20th] Feng Puren, the Chief Secretary and Head of the Social Affairs Section of the county government, and six or seven others went to the Queen Grand Theater in Shuyuan Lane to watch a movie at about 3:00 pm on the 17th of this month. Because the seats were full and the show had been playing for a long time, the gatekeeper Fan Qingshan did not open the door in order to maintain order in the theater. Secretary Feng and others entered the theater from the side door, but the gatekeeper refused, which caused dissatisfaction among Feng and others. In a fit of anger, they hit Fan Qingshan on the head. Afterwards, Ding Heling, the General Affairs Officer of the theater, went to the county government to explain the misunderstanding and apologize, but was detained by Secretary Feng, beaten, and suffered injuries all over his body. At the same time, Fan Qingshan was also detained and tortured in the county, resulting in a great uproar. The theater industry, the trade union, and the workers' union published notices in the local newspapers, pleading with all sectors to uphold justice, and invited the labor community to the park to express their support and demand severe punishment for the culprits, and demanded that Secretary Feng be dismissed and handed over to the judicial authorities for handling. The dispute gradually escalated. Yesterday, Staff Officer Li of the City Defense Department and Police Chief Miao visited the injured Ding Heling and Fan Qingshan at the public hospital. At the same time, the two soldiers who assisted in the crime (county government guards) were sent to the City Defense Department for severe punishment. At present, this storm has eased and is expected to be resolved.</p>
<h3>Five Bandits Arrested in Jiaxing</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jiaxing, 20th] Li Changren, the military training officer of the Self-Defense Squadron stationed in Nanhui Town, led the team to search and suppress Hu Bolong's party on the 16th. Hu's nephew, Hu Yongxiang (alias Lin Chao), was captured, and a letter of appointment was found on him, stating that Lin Chao was appointed as the colonel manager director by Long Longfei (i.e., Hu Bolong), the commander of the Second Brigade of the People's Liberation Army of the Special Commissioner's Office of the Soviet-Zhejiang-Anhui People's Border Area Government of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou District. A number of bullets and a diary were also found, recording the salary and rice paid to Bu Songsheng (the current deputy mayor of Changxing Town and the former secretary of the Kuomintang District Party Department), Chu Jiliang, Ji Mingying, Wang Daming, and others. All the criminals were arrested separately and interrogated by Deputy Commander Lang of the General Team. Bu and others confessed that they were all responsible for intelligence and other work. The five criminals have now been transferred to the County Military Law Office for interrogation. In addition, the Nanhui Police Station arrested a suspected bandit, Ji Hongrong, who has now been sent to the General Bureau for handling.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll</h3>
<p>— Mr. Jun He Ke</p>
<p>Terror and Tension Reach Extremes; Markets Jump Uncontrollably</p>
<p>Yesterday's market development was marked by an atmosphere of extreme terror, reflecting the current situation and the anxieties of the people.</p>
<p>The demand for "survival" has pushed rice, flour, and coal briquettes to unprecedented heights.</p>
<p>Gold prices have surged at an unparalleled rate, and silver dollars are also rising rapidly and fiercely. Strangely, the US dollar remains sluggish, while securities have even hit a limit up, which is truly incredible.</p>
<p>The situation, as the authorities say, has indeed become clear. The market fluctuations have also become clear from now on. The first things that people are concerned about are food and fuel. White rice is already selling for three million per door.</p>
<p>The social bureau issued an order in the market to limit prices, but like a wildfire, prices soared to double the limit in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Isn't that right? To defend Shanghai to the death, asphalt roads and cement courtyards cannot produce food. In order to cooperate with the defense of Shanghai to the death, all citizens should step up hoarding rice and storing food. Therefore, now is not the time for price limits, but rather for allowing prices to rise wildly.</p>
<p>In fact, whether there are price limits or not, the rice market is already in a process of wild price increases, actively developing.</p>
<p>Following the sharp rise in rice, oil and flour are also working hard to catch up.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth and silk are also jumping wildly. The facts could not be clearer.</p>
<p>If the situation continues to develop, the time to stop and shut down machines is approaching. Moreover, the wage issue has now entered a new stage, and there is no room for hesitation on either side.</p>
<p>The wage burden is rising wildly in response to the price of grain and silver dollars. The price of manufactured cotton cloth will naturally leap forward at an even more rapid pace.</p>
<p>Especially silk; just imagine that the spring cocoons are about to hit the market. If the situation changes, there is a risk that this year's cocoons will be completely wasted. Without cocoons, there is no silk. The current small stock of silk naturally has special reasons to command high prices.</p>
<p>The sources of coal, wood, and firewood need not be mentioned.</p>
<p>Petroleum, which was lagging behind in the past, will also advance rapidly from now on.</p>
<p>Interestingly, export specialties such as tea, tung oil, and bristles have also risen sharply.</p>
<p>However, there are also some markets that have grasped the consequences of a major change in the overall situation, and have shown foresight. For example, industrial raw materials such as fuel and pigments, although they are also rising, are only rising, and are far behind the leaps and bounds of other markets.</p>
<p>However, their temporary compromise will not be a problem for them to overtake later.</p>
<p>Gold, US dollars, and silver dollars will undoubtedly become the darlings of the future.</p>
<p>Silver dollars have real sales, and gold dollars are easy to carry.</p>
<p>Future developments will unexpectedly reflect on the US dollar.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange transfer certificates rose by more than double alone, which shows that a lot of funds are fleeing in large quantities. The main stream of the flight is foreign merchants. If the Central Bank does not quickly guard against this, it will be too disadvantageous to let this large source of foreign exchange be cheaply given to others.</p>

<h3>Militia from Qidong Flee by Sea</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to refugees from Qidong who recently arrived in Shanghai, after Qidong fell into communist hands, all the grain stored by the people was requisitioned by the communist soldiers, and the people were forced to subsist on sweet potatoes. Recently, in response to the CCP's crossing of the Yangtze River, the local communist authorities dispatched cadres to the countryside to promote conscription. Militiamen in areas from Nanyang Village to various joint towns were unwilling to leave their homes and rose up in resistance. The communist cadres were caught off guard and many were killed. Fearing retaliation from the communist forces, the militiamen, along with their families, used wooden cabinets as boats and fled by sea.</p>
<h3>Poppy Eradication in Wangcang County, Northern Sichuan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Chongqing, 20th] Wang Lingji telegraphed the Commander-in-Chief's Office on the 20th, stating that in the six townships of Yingcui, Dadao, Wucao, Kuancheng, Fuqing, and Guohua in Wangcang County, Northern Sichuan, all mountainous areas except for those along transportation lines were planted with poppy seedlings. The township chiefs, Yu Shiyi and He Shulin, colluded with unscrupulous gentry to protect the planting and transportation. He secretly dispatched County Magistrate Li Jimin to personally lead troops to eradicate the poppies. Yu and He have fled to the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, and are currently being pursued. Their land has been confiscated to subsidize defense expenses.</p>
<h3>News in Brief</h3>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Tan Bingkun, a native of western Jiangyin County, has committed numerous crimes. After being detained, he escaped from prison during a heavy rain last autumn. He was recently arrested in Wujin by the city defense department during a household registration check and will be returned to Jiangyin for trial soon.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] This county was originally a rice-producing area, and straw was used for fuel, so there was no shortage. However, various military units individually went to the countryside to requisition straw, without unified allocation by cooperative stations. As a result, there is a shortage of fuel for the people, and the price of straw has risen to 100,000 yuan per city dan. Furthermore, some vagrant soldiers and lawless outsiders collude together, buying straw from the villages at a very low price (less than 3 or 4 percent of the market price) and selling it in the city at a high price. The straw in the countryside has been depleted, and there is a risk of food shortages for the people. Therefore, some people have petitioned the authorities to take effective and forceful measures to ban this practice.</p>
<p>Pinghu</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Starting on the 19th, all teachers and staff of the Provincial Jiaxing Normal School took two days of leave to support the provincial secondary schools' efforts to seek reasonable treatment from the Department of Education. They also sent representatives to Hangzhou to take unified action with other schools. Xia Ding and another person were sent as representatives of the school, departing on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Social Services Reader Consultations Legal Clarifications</p>
<h3>Marriage Engagements Made by Parents in Childhood Can Be Deemed Invalid by the Individuals Involved (Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi)</h3>
<p>Question from Huang Zihe</p>
<p>(1) Are marriage engagements made by parents through matchmakers when the individuals involved were underage and did not know the details valid? (2) If someone was forced to marry due to a lack of self-sufficiency as a minor and already has children, can they still deny the marriage engagement? (3) Under what circumstances can grounds for divorce be established? (4) If an old-fashioned, unreasonable marriage is declared dissolved, is alimony required?</p>
<p>[Answer] (1) Marriage engagements made by parents are not necessarily considered invalid, but if the individual involved was a minor at the time of the engagement and lacked capacity, they must express their disagreement in a timely manner upon reaching adulthood. (2) Once married, the law considers the individual to have capacity, and the act of marriage is considered an expression of agreement. (3) Divorce requires grounds for divorce. Article 1052 of the current laws of our country stipulates various situations, and these are the only circumstances that qualify. If both parties agree, a divorce by agreement is also possible. (4) In a divorce, the party without fault has the right to demand compensation from the other party, whether the marriage is old-fashioned or modern.</p>
<p>Globus Newspaper Boston Reader Seeking Chinese Friend</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: Mr. Aefeo Ever, a reader of this newspaper in Boston, sent a letter in April, requesting assistance in finding his Chinese friend, Guo Pingfang (or Fang Guoping). This gentleman once studied at Northeastern University and previously resided on Shigaota Road in Shanghai. He may now be engaged in the jewelry import and export business. His cousin once worked as a sports instructor somewhere in Shanghai. We would like to use a corner of your newspaper to help locate him. We would be grateful for your assistance! Sincerely, Globus Newspaper Agency.</p>
<h3>Seeking Sun Guiying</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: My younger cousin, Sun Guiying, also known as Xiao Gang, is twenty years old and a native of Xinghua, Northern Jiangsu. She is short, with a round, dark face, two gold teeth (front teeth), and two small braids. She was wearing a short jacket with a yellow background and red stripes, black trousers, and red shoes. She speaks with a Jiangbei accent. She has an elderly father at home. Due to being unable to endure abuse from her stepmother, she came to Shanghai for the first time in March and worked as a maid at Zhang's residence at 11 Fuyin Village, Xiaoshadu Road. On April 15th, she accompanied her aunt to the Yumin Egg Store on Madang Road and got lost on the way back. Because she is young and ignorant, unfamiliar with the area, and could not remember the address of Zhang's residence, she has not returned for five days. We are extremely worried! Kind-hearted people, if you know her whereabouts, please send my cousin back or inform us so that our family can be reunited. We will be eternally grateful and never forget your kindness. I have always admired your newspaper's tireless efforts in serving society and hope you can publish this letter to help us find her and reunite our family. I am deeply grateful. Sun Huayuan, April 21st. (Contact at Liu's residence, 1 Xinkang Garden, Fuxing Middle Road)</p>

<h3>Rice Limited to 1.7 Million per Stone Yesterday, Trading Halted in North Market, Cooking Oil, Flour, and Grains All Up Over 50%</h3>
<p>The rice market has been experiencing a sharp rise due to the easing of credit and surging international prices. In the South Market, white polished rice initially opened at 1.7 million yuan, then rose to 1.85 million yuan, and today's spot price is 2.2 million yuan. Early indica rice spot price is 1.9 million, and dry land rice is 1.8 million, with a futures price of 2.16 million today. At 10:30 AM, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the trading price to be limited to 1.7 million yuan, but it was difficult to contain the rise due to the soaring gold price. The market closed higher again. Due to the 1.7 million limit in the North Market, trading could not be conducted, and the market was halted. In the afternoon, the retail price of white polished rice was as high as 2.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>The price surge has been raging like wildfire. With credit suddenly loosening, all commodities are racing forward. The oil price jump is even more violent.

Soybean cake is in short supply, skyrocketing by 70-80%.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Prices jumped 40%. With credit shifting from loose to excessive, importers are extremely enthusiastic, and the surge outside the market is thunderous. Sellers are strongly holding on, and the market shows strong demand exceeding supply. Prices are climbing higher and higher. Morning opening price for bingchuan was 680,000 yuan, once reaching as high as 740,000 yuan mid-day. Selling occurred at high prices near closing, showing a slight retreat, and closed at 710,000 yuan. Lao Che closed at 740,000 yuan. Bran is rapidly catching up. Fusheng rose by over 40%, reaching a peak of 690,000 yuan near closing.</p>

Winter soybeans set a new price of 2.3 million yuan, and car soybeans were priced at 2.2 million yuan, a 70% increase from the previous day. Corn increased by 50%. Peanut merchants are considering action, and the market price secretly set a new peak, with prices reaching as high as 6 million yuan.

<p>Further News: Regarding the rice price issue, according to Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday: the rice price was still relatively stable when the market opened yesterday, opening at 1.7 million. Later, due to the soaring gold and banknotes, the rice price also rose. Director Cao immediately ordered emergency measures, declaring all transactions above 1.7 million yuan invalid. In addition, he ordered supervisors in the market to prohibit rice merchants from communicating with the outside world by telephone, except for personnel from the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Police Bureau, in order to prevent external price increases from stimulating the rice price. Yesterday, 635 stones of rice were transacted in the South Market, and 1,633 stones of rice were transacted in the North Market, for a total of 2,268 stones.</p>

Afternoon next-day trading, due to eager buying from gold firms, with extremely strong demand, opened at 28 million, 29 million, directly breaking through the 30 million mark, with high prices reaching 30.5 million, 31 million.

In order to attract business, the Central Bank specially extended the sell-off by ten minutes, completing sales at 4:10 PM, with Dadecheng selling 919 bars and Zhaofengchang selling 710 bars, totaling a huge 1,629 bars.

<h3>Hua Shares Reached Rise Limit</h3>
<p>Gold prices rose, commodity prices surged, credit eased, and dark interest rates slightly decreased, so the stock market was mostly bullish. Yongsheng Yarn 2 reached its rise limit, setting a new price of 174 yuan again, sometime between 10:30 and 10:50 AM. Other stocks also rallied at this time, with stocks reaching the rise limit including Taiwan Sugar, Shangni, Yonggong, Zhongnei, Zhongni, Rongfeng, Xinyi, Xinhe, Pudian, Shijie, Zhenqi, Commerce, and Tongyi.

<h3>Rumors Abound in the Market, Yarn Prices Soar Endlessly, Leading Fine Cloth Exceeded 2 Million at Opening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the fluctuation of cotton yarn was dramatic again. Due to the easing of credit and the various rumors in the market, coupled with the stimulation of the soaring gold price, everyone was bullish, and local merchants competed to buy, with holders unwilling to sell, resulting in supply failing to meet demand. The market price soared, with Qingjiang rising the most, and as a result, various yarns jumped by 30% to 50%.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened under a buying atmosphere, breaking through to a new high price of 130 million, with the closing slightly relaxed at 125 million, a sharp increase of 37 million compared to the previous day. 32-count Silver Moon initially opened steady at 90 million, and finally advanced to 93 million, a sharp increase of 34 million.</p>

The noon closing price for leading fine cloth was 2.08 million.</p>
<p>The noon closing prices for Four Gentlemen poplin were 2.06 million, an increase of 120,000 from the closing price of the previous day.

The initial opening price for leading fine cloth was 2.9 million, and the initial opening price for Four Gentlemen poplin was 2.8 million. After opening, prices were fiercely raised by all parties, and prices were repeatedly tested at 3.1 million, finally settling at the 3 million mark.</p>
<h3>Silk Trading Sparse, Rayon Soared by Over 20 Million</h3>
<p>Raw silk: Yesterday, due to insufficient inventory, the market inside and outside strongly absorbed it, and the holders were reluctant to sell, all harboring a value-preserving mentality, using 6.2 taels of gold as a standard, so the market showed demand but no supply in the afternoon. Retail investors offered a high price of 115 million yuan for purchases, but still no one sold, and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Rayon: Yesterday, Qiaoxing and Sinia opened at 51 million yuan for the spot month contract. The noon closing price was 56 million yuan. The current ticket transaction initially cost 67 million yuan, and noon closing price reached 71 million yuan. Buying was stronger than selling, a huge increase of 24.4 million yuan compared to the previous noon closing price.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Huaqiang silk fabric initially rose to the limit of 28.08 million yuan and closed. After closing, off-exchange trading exploded with a fierce surge, rising from 36 million yuan to a peak of 41 million yuan. This was because the factory made no profit, and they were not opening throwing-machine orders. Skin-ball trading flourished as a result. Supply could not meet demand, with a 40% increase compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Production and Export Enterprise Loan Review Routine Meeting</h3>
<p>The Production and Export Enterprise Loan Review Committee of the National Bank Discount and Loan Association held its twentieth routine meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Lin Chongliu, and approved 52 loan cases.</p>

<h3>Sugar Sets New High Price Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar prices set new highs again due to the easing of credit and dark interest rates of 150-180 yuan in the industry, causing competitive buying. On the morning market, No. 24 coarse sugar was 2.35 million yuan. Although it once fell to 2.25 million yuan midway, it immediately rose back to 2.44 million yuan.

<h3>Tea Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of tea, when converted to gold yuan, has soared into the clouds. However, actual sales are just the opposite, declining again. Buying momentum is stagnant, and some in the industry are experiencing scarce visitors.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Jointly Decided to Value in Gold</h3>
<p>It is reported that due to the recent daily changes in currency, the gap between wholesale and retail prices has often been disconnected, and raw material manufacturers have been unable to estimate costs. After a resolution by various industry peers, starting from the 21st, the calculation method will generally use gold as the standard. The prices of finished products will be re-determined, with one cent of gold equal to one yuan of the base price, converted into gold yuan for calculation, in order to contribute.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Price Rise Astonishing</p>
<p>Tung oil market yesterday: Although in the midst of a confusing situation, the domestic spring sales were continuous, and the buying atmosphere was exuberant, and the process remained active. The price of reciprocal exchanges was measured in gold, and the original path revolved, with each dan worth three cents and three points of gold, green oil was four cents per dan, and both positive and negative brands were around three cents and eight points per barrel. According to today's gold price calculation, it has surged, an 80% advance compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Baseball Begins Two-Week Postponement, Sino-American Strong Teams Will Have a Friendly Match Tomorrow First</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Racetrack Softball League, originally scheduled to open on May 1st, has now been resolved by the organizers to postpone it for two weeks, and it will begin on May 16th (Monday).</p>
<p>There are already twenty participating teams. The organizers, according to the strength of each team, and in imitation of the World Professional Baseball method, divided them into Group A and Group B to compete. The Panda, Xiqinghong, US Air Force and other eight teams are in Group A; the remaining twelve teams are in Group B.</p>
<p>The games will be held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons, with no games on weekends. The venue is inside the racetrack, but if each team can provide transportation for the opposing team's players and obtain the other team's consent, they may request that the game be held at another venue. The sports equipment needed for the game will be provided by the US Navy Sports Department to lend to each team.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the league, after the league was announced to open on May 1st last week, they received letters, telegrams, and verbal protests from all parties, all of which considered the start of the softball season to be too early. Except for the US military, other Chinese and foreign teams were mostly unable to concentrate on training due to the fact that the basketball, football, and track and field seasons had not officially ended, which would inevitably affect the strength of each team. After several meetings and consultations, it was decided to postpone it by half a month. The league will be held twice this season. The one that starts on May 16th is the first, adopting a single round-robin system. It is expected to end at the end of June. The second league will begin in early July, and will be changed to a double round-robin system.</p>
<p>The list of teams in each group of the league is as follows:</p>
<p>Group A</p>
<p>Panda, Sheraton, Dichzhenge (warship), St. Ride A, Texaco A, Country Club, Xiqinghong, Aviation.</p>
<p>Group B</p>
<p>Tiyun, Military Officer, Texaco B, Dragon Tiger, Meteorology, St. Ride B, Portuguese Merchant A, Portuguese Merchant B, Red Star, Wild Duck, Tiger Team, Xiqinglan</p>
<p>In addition, the Racetrack Authority believes that the only formal ball game competition with a significant scale is rugby, and the rugby season ended at the end of February. Softball practice began in early April. In order to facilitate the practice of each team and provide a reference for beginners, the authorities intend to do their best to arrange friendly exhibition matches before the league begins. Tomorrow (23rd) may be a good show, with the strongest teams from China and the United States competing. On the Chinese side, the Panda will be led by the 19th, and the US military will be represented by the Sheraton warship. (For time and location, please pay attention to tomorrow's newspaper).</p>

<h3>Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament: Dagong and Huili Advance; Women's Group: Ying Team Wins Narrowly Over John</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Mayor's Cup basketball night featured three matches. Due to exams at Hujiang University, the Ying team (composed of female students from Hujiang University) started at 6:00 PM. Over 2,000 fans were enthusiastic. (1) Huili defeated Maoxun 41-23, with a halftime score of 23-15. (2) The women's Ying team defeated John 32-25, with a halftime score of 15-10. (3) The Dagong team defeated the Pu team 82-47, with a halftime score of 37-22. The winners advance to the second week of the tournament.</p>
<p>Maoxun started strong but faded later. Initially, they surprisingly led Dafei Huang 11-3. Huili dared not slack off, and Cao Zhiji and Wei Xu entered the game, leading to a turnaround. Their AB team combined forces, creating a formidable presence. In the showdown between the two university women's teams, Yang Shujun of the Ying team showcased her skills. However, at the beginning of the third quarter, the score was recorded at 17-16, and they were almost overtaken by John. John was not as fast-paced as their opponents.</p>
<p>In the final match, the Dagong team performed to their fullest. The Pu team seemed fragmented at the beginning, appearing vulnerable. Due to Dagong's excessive emphasis on performance, the Pu team managed to struggle somewhat. Cai Wenhua's entry in the second half was well-received by the audience. Wenhua, Zhongqiang, and Boling scored the most points.</p>
<h3>Huili Defeats Maoxun</h3>
<p>The first match, Huili versus Maoxun, began at 6:00 PM. The five players for Huili were Shang Chongyu, Chen Zhengmiao, Yu Dinghou, Bai Baokang, and Shang Chongling. The opposing team consisted of Wang Rongsen, Sun Jiashuang, Zhuo Guanzheng, Zhu Jianxiong, and Chen Hongyi. Gongsen took the lead, but Huili's Chong and Dinghou scored three consecutive points. Unexpectedly, Maoxun displayed great power, briefly leading 5-3, and then called a timeout to strategize. Huili replaced Lu with Shu Yuan, and Maoxun's Jiawen played aggressively, quickly making it 11-3. Chen Kan replaced Jianxiong, and Chongyu began to "respond" slightly, gradually showing vitality. At 15-10, Zhiji and Wei Xu simultaneously "went into the water" replacing Baokang and Shu Yuan. The old generals' tactics were indeed effective, and the cooperation between Cao and Chongling resulted in a 15-15 tie. Wei scored on a free throw to take the lead, and Zhengmiao "added fuel to the fire." Huili scored thirteen points in one go. Maoxun went from active to passive, and at halftime, Huili led 22-15, turning the tide.</p>
<p>In the second half, both teams made significant changes to their lineups. Maoxun's players were Chen Kan, Songyi, Gangzhen, Zhaocheng, and Hongyi, while Huili also rotated players. The Shang brothers, Zhengmiao, Shuyuan, and Baokang kept the game balanced. Maoxun's attacking movements seemed slower, and their short-range passes were too strong, making it difficult for their teammates to catch them. Huili's Fuhai came on as a substitute for Shuyuan. At the end of the match, Huili won 41-23, advancing to the next round.</p>
<h3>Ying Team Defeats John</h3>
<p>The women's teams from John and Hujiang (Ying Team) took the field, "refreshing the eyes" of the audience. For five minutes, everyone was chasing and running, and because they lacked experience playing men's rules, every time they dribbled the ball, they seemed startled. Wang Shan of the Ying team missed three free throws, but Huang Pinzhen and Yang Shujun successively scored six points. Yang's "braking" was quite good, but John seemed unable to run. Zhang Luoluo repeatedly attempted shots but missed. Wei Meijin pulled through, and Han Yun scored again. In the first quarter, the Ying Team took a 6-4 lead by two points. Lin Jingyi's score brought the score to a 6-6 tie at the beginning of the second quarter, then 8-8. Jingyi's free throw put John ahead by one point. In the university league, the two teams were evenly matched champions. Today, these rivals met on a narrow path, becoming particularly fierce. Yang Shujun of the Ying team demonstrated extraordinary talent and potential. Wang Shan scored a basket, making the halftime score 15-10.</p>
<p>Judging from the posture of several players on the Ying team, outsiders speculated that there might be students from the Municipal Sports Academy "integrated within." At the beginning of the third quarter, the score was 17-16, with John only half a point behind. However, joy turned to sorrow, and the Ying team became rampant again, scoring eight points in an instant. At the end of the quarter, the score was 25-18. In the final quarter, John made frequent adjustments, still attempting a desperate move. Han's momentum was fierce, bringing the score to 26-23. Yao Huijuan was penalized for her fifth foul and sent off, and Meijin filled her place. The active members of the Ying team were all "sleeves damp with sweat," ultimately defeating John 32-25.</p>
<h3>Tonight's Table Tennis Group A Competition: Hualian Takes on Bank of China; Bank of China Defeated Post Office B by 3-2 the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>In the fourth session of the Table Tennis League, the night before last, Group A's Post Office B faced Bank of China at the Postal Affairs Table Tennis Room. Bank of China had suffered a crushing defeat to the Post Office before. Since then, when facing the Post Office team again, everyone fought desperately, putting in their utmost effort. As expected, with determination, they finally relied on the valiant resistance of Gao Zhonglin, Zhu Yongkang, and Zhu Guozhen to achieve the final victory. Post Office B unwisely abandoned the steady stroke of Shen Airen, replacing him with the chopper Gu Hehua as the lead-off, a poor strategy. The erroneous arrangement of the five-game list allowed Bank of China the opportunity to win. Gu Hehua happened to face Gao Zhonglin, also a defensive player. Gu could not bear it and changed his strategy, switching from chopping to stroking, repeatedly touching the net and losing two straight games. The other third and fourth games were extremely intense. Veteran Zhu Yongkang of Bank of China was narrowly troubled by Zheng Yongquan, the chopper from Post Office B, in an extremely close score, but ultimately remained calm and forced back Yongquan, a victory snatched from danger. After Dai's loss, the full burden fell on the shoulders of team captain Zhu Zhongsun. Zhu's psychological tension led to an abnormal performance. Zhu Guozhen, the stroker from Bank of China, became increasingly brave, winning two straight games after losing the first, laying the foundation for Bank of China's victory. As a result, Bank of China defeated Post Office B by 3-2, which can be considered fortunate. The records of both teams and the results of each game in Group B are recorded below:</p>
<p>Group B Results</p>
<p>Agricultural Machinery won Guansheng (B3) 5-0</p>
<p>Lingyun won Er Ma (B1) 5-0</p>
<p>Post Office 3 won Star (B3) 4-1</p>
<p>America Asia won New Asia (B3) 4-1</p>
<p>Post Office 4 won Shu Ping (B1) 3-2</p>
<p>Lingyun won Textile 4 (B1) 5-0</p>
<p>Tonight (the 22nd), starting at 7:00 PM, there will be one more Group A game and five Group B games. In Group A, the strong Hualian team will face Bank of China. The latter, riding the momentum of victory over Post Office B, will fight Hualian again tonight, with the entire team displaying vigorous spirit and redoubled energy. Hualian is known as one of the top five teams in Shanghai, with its strong reputation spreading far and wide to the capital. Its roster includes versatile players such as Zhang Zhihong, who qualified as a Chinese team member in international competitions ten years ago, and stroker Deng Xiurong, who was selected as a representative of the Shanghai United Team and defeated Ma Hanrong, a champion from the Hong Kong Confucian Society, bringing glory to Shanghai. Others, such as chopper Li Zhen and stroker Lu Wenliang, are also experienced players. All eight players on the team are Cantonese athletes, but tonight is their first time on the field, so their condition is uncertain. It is expected that the two teams will meet in full force, with upper-level coordination, and will definitely threaten Hualian. The competition will take place at the Hualian Table Tennis Room, No. 194 Nanjing East Road. The venue has been repaired and arranged to be very spacious, accommodating up to a thousand spectators. There will be no tickets sold. The organizers welcome guests of the opening ceremony to come and watch the game to express their gratitude for their previous efforts. The order of each game tonight is recorded below:</p>
<p>Hualian vs. Bank of China (Group A) 7:00 PM Hualian</p>
<p>China Merchants vs. Fansheng (Group B2) 7:00 PM Jinmen</p>
<p>Guansheng vs. Post Office 3 (Group B3) 7:00 PM Post Office</p>

Cunzhong broke his nose, and Gengsheng came on as a substitute. At halftime, the score was 37-22.</p>
<p>In the second half, Wenhua and Wenlong replaced Boling and Gengsheng. Wenlong remained calm and composed, scoring baskets with ease. The Pu team fought hard but could not resist. Zhaoqi and Wencheng's shots also did not "rebound," but the score was still about twenty points apart. At 64-45, Boling was replaced by Zhan Chen. Zhan, due to a stomachache after dinner, lamented his condition, not yet recovered, and unable to exert himself. Resting and waiting, he did not score last night.

<h3>Table Tennis Knowledge (13)</h3>
<p>X. The Art of Serving</p>
<p>Serving is the beginning of the battle.</p>
<p>When serving, first hold the ball with the thumb, index finger, and middle finger of the hand that does not hold the racket. Raise the ball about three or four inches above the table surface, then make the racket perform a 75-degree bow and strike downward on the ball. When serving, first release the ball, then strike the ball with the racket onto the table, and then from your own table surface into the opponent's table surface.</p>
<p>When serving, the server should stand outside the end of the table, and both hands should be slightly behind the table when serving.</p>
<p>Lin Sheng's Note: This year's Table Tennis League adopts the International Table Tennis Federation's rules, so serving should be done according to the above serving method.</p>
<p>The served ball must bounce once on your own table surface before passing over the net and landing on the opponent's table surface. If the ball does not bounce once on your own table surface first, but is directly hit onto the opponent's table, or bounces off something on the side, etc., these are all illegal and are considered "lost ball" according to the rules.</p>
<p>When serving, being too far away from the table will be exploited by the opponent. But when learning, it is difficult to serve far away from the table, so you can only stand close to the end of the table. After practicing, you can gradually increase the distance from the table.</p>
<p>The strength of the serve depends entirely on the striking force of the racket. If the striking force is heavy, then the power is strong and the ball goes far. If the striking force is light, then the power is weak and the ball is light.</p>
<p>Some people often look at the opponent's standing position and use the serve to gain victory. For example, if the opponent is far away from the table, then serve lightly, so that the ball's bounce is small and it lands near the net on the opponent's side. The opponent will often be unable to move forward to return the shot. If the opponent is very close to the table, serve with force, so that the ball's bounce is strong, crossing the net and reaching the opponent's far end quickly and high, trapping the opponent in a situation where they cannot retreat. However, if this shot is too light, it is easy to hit the net. If it is too heavy, it is easy to go out of bounds. Therefore, without considerable experience, it cannot be easily attempted. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare each person's true ability when winning in this way, so some table tennis players are unwilling to adopt this strategy.</p>
<p>Serving postures are also very different. Some put their bodies far back, with both hands completely in front of the body. Others put the hand holding the ball in front of the body and pull the hand holding the racket behind the body before moving it forward. The latter method is easier to use than the former.</p>
<p>When practicing returning the ball, at the moment the ball leaves the opponent, you must calmly prepare to receive the ball. Because when preparing, raising your spirit naturally gives strength to your wrist and tightly grips the racket. The returned ball must cross the net or go around the net post to reach the opponent's area.</p>
<p>XI. The Art of Defending</p>
<p>What is blocking? What is chopping? How is a brush shot played? What is a lob shot?</p>
<p>Some people advocate that when playing table tennis, you only need to be bold and just hit the ball, without necessarily learning this first and then learning that. In fact, although this method of learning may produce one or two good shots, it is an accidental coincidence and there is no guarantee. When playing table tennis, you must first learn to defend, and competitions should be the same. An experienced table tennis player often uses retreat as a way to advance, patiently defending first to explore the opponent's weaknesses, and then deciding on the strategy for attack.</p>
<p>Skillfully using defensive techniques, both left and right, can often tire the opponent out and prevent them from having the opportunity to attack fiercely.</p>
<p>There are many ways to defend: "blocking" is defending, "slowing down" is defending, and "brushing" is also defending. When practicing, patiently defending allows you to hit the ball many times and get more opportunities to practice. When competing, patiently defending allows you to avoid losing. Sometimes, you may also return the shot appropriately and get the opportunity to win.</p>
<p>First, we will discuss the methods of defending in detail:</p>

<h3>The Story of Man</h3>
<p>— Hong Qi</p>
<p>When God created the donkey, He said to it, "I give you twenty years of life. Are you satisfied with this number?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Dear Father in Heaven, please have mercy on me. If I live in this world for twenty years, I will always have to carry extremely heavy things, people will ride on my back, and the whip will always fall on my back like raindrops." Twenty years is too long! Because of the donkey's plea, the merciful God agreed to reduce it by half.</p>
<p>The second creature God created was the dog. He gave the dog twenty years of life. But the dog cried and barked,</p>
<p>"How can I live so long? I will become old and useless," and eventually be kicked out the door to freeze and starve. "God, half the days are enough." The merciful God again granted the dog's request.</p>
<p>Then God created the monkey, giving it twenty-five years of life, and telling the monkey that it did not need to work and had no worries. But it would be born very ugly, and everyone would make fun of it. As a result, the monkey said it did not want to live so long, and ten years of life was enough. God agreed.</p>
<p>Finally, God created the most intelligent of all creatures—man. He specially gave him thirty-five years of life, fully expecting the same phenomenon of rejection. Unexpectedly, the opposite happened.</p>
<p>Man said in a dissatisfied tone, "Dear God! Thirty-five years is such a short time. I just got comfortable, married a wife, and had children, but I'm going to die!" So, God agreed to give him the ten years that were left over from the donkey, but he was still not satisfied. As a result, God also gave man the twenty-five years that were left over from the dog and the monkey.</p>
<p>So, man began to live happily and painlessly. He ate, drank, played...and lived like this for thirty-five years. In the next ten years, man worked like a donkey, increasing his wealth. In the following ten years, man guarded his property like a dog, often getting angry and unable to sleep at night. In the next fifteen years, man was made fun of like a monkey and slowly became old and ugly. This is the life that man himself requested when God created him. Only after seventy years of age did he quietly die.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Chopsticks</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>I recently attended a banquet hosted by a friend from Fujian and saw ten pairs of lacquer chopsticks made by Shen Shao'an of Fujian. They were green like apples and coated with a very thick layer of gold mud, painted with plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums, each flower with a different color. The craftsmanship was exquisite. (It is said that these are old heirlooms, with excellent color and quality, completely different from the counterfeit goods sold at sea today.) It makes one think that in the peaceful days of the past, in addition to fine clothes and delicacies, people would make this "lacquer chopsticks and jade plate" as an embellishment, simply for "pleasure and enjoyment." But in these days of poverty and hardship for the people, even those who have the means are concerned about the difficulties of the times. How can they bear to use lacquer chopsticks and a jade plate alone? However, the widespread and long-standing use of chopsticks in our country is something that can be discussed.</p>
<p>Chopsticks were commonly referred to as zhu in ancient times, or zhu, or jia. They were made of various materials, such as gold lacquer, ivory, bamboo, or wood. Details can be found in the classics, histories, and various notebooks. Chopsticks were referred to as zhu, as in the "Historical Records: The House of Song Weizi," "Tao began to use ivory chopsticks." "Explanation of Names: Li Shizhen said, 'Ancient chopsticks were made of bamboo, but in recent times, people also use various woods and ivory to make them.'" "Book of Han: Biography of Zhang Liang," "Your minister asks to borrow chopsticks to wish him well." Zhang Yan said, "Borrow the chopsticks used for eating to draw with one's fingers." Chopsticks were referred to as zhu, as in Wang Renyu's "Kaiyuan Tianbao Anecdotes," "Song Jing was the prime minister, and the court and the public praised him.... The emperor赐ed Jing with the gold zhu he used." Yuan Li Kan's "Bamboo Manual" also records bamboo zhu, which I will omit here. Chopsticks were referred to as jia, as in the "Book of Rites," "...for soups with vegetables, use jia." Note: "Today, some people call zhu jia." Duan's commentary on "Shuowen" states, "Zhu, the Book of Rites calls it jia, borrowed as zhu." As for the popular name of chopsticks, kuai, it probably did not arise too early. Ming Lu Rong's "Soybean Collection of Miscellaneous Records" states, "Commonly, zhu are called kuai, similar to quick. The custom in Wu is to avoid saying 'zhu' when traveling by boat. Zhu is homophonous with dwell, so zhu is called kuai."</p>
<p>Today, people often have the habit of throwing down their chopsticks in times of worry and anger. Examining historical records, there are precedents for this. The "Book of Jin" records that Wu Yin cried sadly when his mother died and threw down his chopsticks. Jian Sheng's "Wild Tales" records that during the Hongwu period, Song Lian was convicted, and the Empress Dowager prepared a solemn fast, making offerings to protect him. The emperor angrily threw down his chopsticks and stood up. This shows that the nature and habits of people, both ancient and modern, are similar, even down to their underwear.</p>
<h3>Strange Customs Overseas</h3>
<p>— Zhu Cangyi</p>
<p>In northern England, when each child is born, the parents give him (or her) a small box containing a pinch of salt, a sixpenny coin, and a box of matches. This symbolizes: salt for health, money for wealth, and matches for lighting the path to heaven.</p>
<p>The American Industrial Association recently created a robot. With its metal arms and rotating head, it realistically makes various gestures and lively speeches. The robot's abdomen contains an electrically powered machine, whose complex structure resembles the human internal organs. When the robot speaks, its hips, arms, and head move simultaneously to show realism.</p>
<p>In post-war Japan, marriage for young men and women is quite problematic, especially for women. A certain magazine社 unexpectedly came up with the unprecedented "Group Partner Finding Meeting." Anyone without a partner can participate. Upon joining, a detailed personal history is filled out, and a numbered badge is issued to be worn on the chest. Afterwards, the desired person is sought in the designated park. If the loved one is found, they go to the office located in the park to investigate the history of the number on their chest. If it is considered acceptable, they go to chat with him (her) and finally submit a marriage proposal.</p>

<h3>Scam</h3>
<p>— Pei Jing</p>
<p>At the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Fujian Road, a small group of people were engaged in a transaction.</p>
<p>"Who wants yarn? Only 300,000 yuan per pound."</p>
<p>The one shouting was a skinny, short, veteran scammer, wearing a tattered overcoat, holding a ball of red Bee Brand yarn.</p>
<p>"Selling for 300,000 yuan?"</p>
<p>The question came from a barefoot man passing by.</p>
<p>"Still saying it's expensive? Look at the goods, it's Bee Brand!"</p>
<p>"Can you make it cheaper?"</p>
<p>"Heaven knows! The shops are selling it for 700,000 yuan!" the veteran scammer said.</p>
<p>The barefoot man knew this price was very cheap, but he still wanted to bargain. Hearing his reply, he remained silent.</p>
<p>The veteran scammer continued, "This is slightly inferior goods, otherwise, it wouldn't be this cheap."</p>
<p>"How much are you sincerely offering?" a young man interjected.</p>
<p>The barefoot man timidly said, "I only have 200,000 yuan in my pocket, will you sell it?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, people from Suzhou kill the price by half, go ask around the market and come back."</p>
<p>At this point, the barefoot man realized the tone of his speech was unfavorable and walked away, disappointed.</p>
<p>Seeing the deal fall apart, the veteran scammer made a concession.</p>
<p>"Hey! Come, come, come over here." He raised his hand and beckoned, gesturing for him to return.</p>
<p>Hearing his call, the barefoot man came back.</p>
<p>"I'll add a little to whatever you have, and sell it to you."</p>
<p>"I really only have 200,000 yuan," he replied.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll sell it to you," he said firmly.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man in a long gown walked past and said to the veteran scammer:</p>
<p>"Watch out for the police! Be sensible."</p>
<p>The veteran scammer quickly hid the ball of red yarn while saying to the barefoot man.</p>
<p>"The police are coming! Let's go to the alley, okay?"</p>
<p>He nodded and followed behind the veteran scammer. They turned a corner and walked into a filthy alleyway, where they all went inside. Out of curiosity, I followed them in as well.</p>
<p>"Sir, can you help me?"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a rough, hoarse voice rang out, and a man stood before me, tall and burly with thick, dark arms. His face was extremely menacing. I realized that he was one of the people standing next to the veteran scammer earlier.</p>
<p>Why did he approach me? I couldn't help but feel suspicious. So, I slowed my pace and watched from a distance.</p>
<p>I saw the veteran scammer in the alley wrap a ball of yarn in paper. Then, he hid it in the tattered coat under his left arm. The barefoot man took out a stack of banknotes, which the veteran scammer took and placed in his pocket. At the same time, he took out a package from under the right arm of his tattered coat, this package was the same as the paper package under his left arm. The barefoot man received the package and walked out triumphantly. The group of scammers quickly walked away as well.</p>
<p>He hadn't walked far before he excitedly opened it to look. Oh no! How could it be a package of filthy rags? It seemed the barefoot man couldn't restrain himself from anger, turning around and angrily chasing after them.</p>
<p>"Hey! What are you doing?" a young man in a suit walked over and asked.</p>
<p>"Look, they sold rags as yarn! Scammers...!" He said as he chased.</p>
<p>"I'll chase after them for you, you go report it to the police first," the young man in the suit said.</p>
<p>The barefoot man chased after them hastily. Seeing that he ignored him, the young man in the suit walked away on his own.</p>
<p>I suddenly understood. It turned out these people were all accomplices! The barefoot man had fallen into their trap.</p>
<h3>The Effect of Color</h3>
<p>— Sang</p>
<p>Before going to the market, my wife took a few thousand-yuan bills and said to me, "The paper quality of these thousand-yuan bills is the worst!" But after comparing them with other denominations of banknotes, I didn't think that was entirely true. The reason why people feel the paper is poor is simply because the color printed on the thousand-yuan bill is an unpleasant grey.</p>
<p>People's vision is indeed easily deceived, especially in response to color.</p>
<p>For example, the Blackfriars Bridge in London used to be painted a dark, somber black. Later, because there were frequent suicides on the bridge, the government repainted it a bright green. After the repainting, the number of suicides decreased by a third.</p>
<p>Since an American butcher shop painted its walls green instead of white, its sales have increased significantly. The reason is that white walls leave a grey afterimage in customers' eyes, which also casts a dismal, deathly color on the fresh beef. The green color after the repaint not only does not detract from the beef, but enhances its bright red color.</p>
<p>Another well-known example is that in an American factory, female workers often felt cold while eating in the cafeteria, but the automatic thermostats installed in the cafeteria were not damaged. It seemed that the feeling of cold was impossible. Later, the factory authorities tried repainting the blue walls of the cafeteria a lively orange, and the feeling stopped happening.</p>
<p>Color does have a significant impact on people's psychological feelings. Many factories in the United States have used this color effect to increase worker efficiency and reduce waste in the workplace. In this way, not only are the factory's losses reduced and profits increased, but workers are also spared many possible illnesses due to the improvement of the working environment.</p>
<h3>Tianping and Lingyan</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yan</p>
<p>People who visit Suzhou generally have a common problem: they focus too much on the urban area. Watching flowers in the soft, bustling world and seeking fun in the lively scene, this problem is especially prevalent among "Shanghai-style" tourists. This time, due to a chance opportunity, I arrived at this "Venice of the East" garden city, which I had longed to revisit for more than ten years. My first impression was that Suzhou was originally beautiful and quiet, but it had been ruined by those hurried travelers, destroying its charm.</p>
<p>Suzhou is indeed a beautiful city, but its beauty requires living there, slowly appreciating, and enjoying it. True tourists should look for seclusion and leisure in its outskirts. Although Tianping and Lingyan are limited in scope, they still exude a bit of elegance, which is enough for ordinary mortals like us to soothe our emotions and indulge our nature.</p>
<p>After arriving in Mudu by car, there is naturally no need to accept the solicitations of those who say "Do you want a sedan chair?". Just buy a bamboo cane – inexpensive and of good quality – and walk slowly by yourself. This is going up Lingyan. Find a suitable place to sit on the top of the mountain, and in the gentle breeze, look at the rivers, mountains, and green fields below. Taihu Lake is like a mirror, wheat fields are like velvet, and the city of Suzhou is faintly visible with two or three pagoda tops in the hazy smoke. This clear picture and sound will penetrate your heart, unless you truly fall asleep.</p>
<p>I feel that this is enough for enjoying Lingyan. The "Old Site of Wu Palace" is originally the most attractive place, but when we see that it is not "old" at all, our interest is inevitably diminished. As for the temples with walls full of advertisements, and many signs that say "Tourists Keep Out", it is easy to be disappointed.</p>
<p>From Lingyan to Tianping, there is no need to walk the brick-paved slope. Those with strong feet can walk as they please. Everywhere you look are red camellias and white roses. You hop and skip to the foot of the mountain, and you will inevitably pick a large bunch with reluctant to let go of them.</p>
<p>When you arrive at Tianping, you feel the meaning of the words "scenery". Tianping's stones are not dry but fertile, not particularly strange but quite beautiful. Under the pine forest of Fan Zhongyan's tomb, look up at the Baiyun Hermitage on the mountainside, the tourists in the distance, the soaring eagles nearby, and the slight sound of waves brought by the pines... At this time, if you are a poet, you will naturally create poetry; a painter will naturally leave behind his visual beauty; and a fool like me will also feel gratitude and joy in my heart.</p>
<p>There is no need to climb Tianping, because it is suitable for viewing. There is no need to seek out famous scenic spots such as Parrot Stone and A Thread of Sky. In comparison, Tianping is better than Lingyan. The former seems to be a natural beauty, while the latter has traces of makeup everywhere. For the beauty of nature, "natural" is a basic condition.</p>
