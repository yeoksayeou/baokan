<h3>李代總統昭吿同胞　決以最大努力謀求和平　不合民主原則之法令悉將迅速撤消</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕李代總統今（廿二日）發表文吿如下：總統蔣公決然引退，宗仁懍於救國救民之義，出膺艱鉅，目前國家與人民所遭受戰爭之痛苦，已至不堪忍受之程度，弭戰謀和，實爲全國一致之呼聲。宗仁當茲視事之初，願爲我全國同胞吿者：政府今日卽將以高度之誠意與最大之努力，謀取和平之實現，此一任務，明知異常艱鉅，但爲國家爲人民，宗仁必竭盡一切努力以赴，只要和平能早日實現，國家能早日步入和平建設之坦途，宗仁個人進退絕不計及，耿耿此心，應爲全國同胞所共鑒。</p>
<p>在八年抗戰之後，繼之以三年之內戰，不僅將抗戰勝利後國家可能復興之一綫生機毀滅無遺，而戰禍遍及黃河南北，田園廬舍悉遭摧毀荒廢，無辜人民之死傷成千累萬，妻離子散啼饑號寒者到處皆是，此一慘絕人寰的浩刧，實爲我國內戰史上空前所未有。吾人矢志國民革命，原爲救國救民，自應及早消弭戰爭，速召祥和，庶可爲國家保元氣，爲人民留生機，否則戰爭若再繼續延長，國家必將淪於萬刦不復之境地。今全國旣一致呼籲和平，不特政府方面決心尊重民意，卽中共方面亦已表示願意商談，基此同一之信念與相忍爲國之誠心，無論前途如何困難，宗仁相信和平終有實現之一日。</p>
<p>茲爲表示誠意與決心，政府將從事掃除一切和平障礙，凡過去一切有碍人民自由及不合民主原則之法令與行動，悉將分別迅速予以撤消或停止，冀能培育國內和平空氣，使和談工作得以順利進行。至於中共方面所提八條件，政府願卽開始商談。茲已派定代表，俟得中共方面答覆，和談卽可舉行，並且爲期集思廣益，衆擎易舉，宗仁更已分電邀請全國各黨派及社會上愛好和平人士，共同贊助。總之，自今以後，政府工作目標集中於爭取和平之實現，個人服務方針亦僉以人民意旨爲依歸，並望全國同胞，同心協力，促成大舉，國家前途，實深利賴。</p>
<h3>政院昨開臨時政務會議　推定和談代表團　邵力子張治中彭昭賢黃紹竑鍾天心一俟中共提出商談地點後立即出發</h3>

<h3>邵氏發表感想</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕政院推派與中共進行商談之代表國首席代表邵力子氏，廿二日晚接見記者，發表渠接受該項使命後之感想。邵氏首稱：我接受到這個命令，感到十分惶恐，並認爲代表團之使命異常艱鉅，惟決盡全力以達成和平之目的。邵氏稱：國共雙方過去有多年之裂痕，以迄於此次殘酷之戰爭，最近兩方面所作之表示（按卽總統元旦文吿及毛澤東時局聲明），距離甚遠，故此次使命將異常困難。惟以和平乃人人所迫切需要，爲保持國家元氣，和平實更需要，現兩方面均已看到此點，我相信如大家都有誠意，和平是能成功的。邵氏强調稱：因此我同時感到此一使命是可以能達成的。代表團的人一定都竭盡全力促成和談圓滿進行，使戰爭能早日結束。至商談之地點問題，部氏則稱吾人正誠懇的希望中共能早日答覆，尤其提出商談地點，使商談能及早開始。旋記者詢以此項商談開始後，是否以停戰爲第一課題，邵氏稱非，至其商談之進行程序與依據相信對總統文吿所提條件及毛澤東時局聲明之條件均不能堅持，否則將不能談下去，故一切問題將俟商談開始後再說。邵氏今日之情緒顯甚愉悅，在其與記者談話之過程中，邵氏曾接獲一自稱為南京一小市民之電話，此一市民無疑係仰幕邵氏奔走和平之名及風聞邵氏今日之新命而通此電話，彼僅詢邵氏以「和平有希望否？」一語，邵氏答稱「大家希望和平，和平就有希望了。」記者轉出時，邵氏復稱，吾願不負大家之希望，能達成和平之目的。</p>

<h3>中國新經濟政策之具體辦法</h3>
<p>— 壽勉成</p>
<p>（關於新經濟政策之八項原則，已於一月十日發表，茲將其具體辦法續刊於后。）</p>
<p>（一）財產與所得</p>
<p>中國新經濟政策應實行社會化的私有財產制度，保持財產之私有而限制其私有之範圍與利益，其因特殊原因必須收歸公有者，不在此限。例如土地及其他財產之公有，固亦不失爲一種制度，但財產有以勞力換來者，亦有　倖或投機得來者，一律收歸公有，處體頗難公平合理；且在人民針會化觀念未造成以前對生產效率必有不良影響。加以財產制度之問題，不亦所有權，而在使用權及享受權，如能對所有者加以各種限制，則保持私有制度，可謂有利而無弊。</p>
<p>人民工作之所得，依其工作之數量與質量定之；凡在工作年齡及具有工作能力之人民，均應從事有益於社會之工作，其無工作機會者，由政府支配之。關於每人之所得，前曾有主張一律平等待遇者，此制殊不合理，且足使人不努力於工作，流弊極大，蘇俄曾一度採行，不久卽予廢除。全體人民所應平等享受，應爲社會生產水準所許可之最低限度的生活。但能力較强工作較多者，必予以最低限度以上之生活，始足以激勵。或謂能力强弱，非由天賦，此爲另一問題，將來雖應使能力水準普遍提高，但能力提高以後，其收入亦自可能提高，仍下失於公平。惟社會仍不斷需要鼓勵特殊之能力表現，否則能力水準，將無法促使前進。</p>
<p>人民之不在工作年齡或缺乏工作能力者，應由政府矛以最低限度生活之保障，成暫由社會之有剩餘所得者分擔保陣之責任，社會上之老幼殘廢孕育婦女，雖無工作收入，仍不得不維持其生活，此項生活費用，應以由政府負擔爲原則；但在中國社會因人口衆多，婦女工作能力缺乏，家庭制度特殊，如全由政府開支，徒增非必要之負擔，似可規定收入在一定標準以下所負擔人數超過一定標準時，始得請求政府補助。</p>
<p>人口之增殖應加以調節，以期與地力物力之產力相適應。</p>
<p>全國人民之在工作年齡具有工作能力，並獲有工作機會者均應加入社會保險使失業疾病及死亡者，其生活費用均能有所支給。</p>
<p>（二）農業與工業</p>
<p>民生日用品之農業原料及生活必須之農產，應由農民組設鄉鎭合作社家業生產合作社或合作農塲生產之。農民爲整理地權，改良土地使用，推廣優良品稱及技術，發展農田水利及農村副業，以組織合作社辦理爲最妥善之方歲·各國均有先例，卽蘇俄亦不能例外，合作農塲，應以土壤毗連水利需要相同之田畝爲基礎，以便利經界之整理與水利之設施。</p>
<p>各合作社及合作農塲，應個別或聯合設置農倉，受政府之統制，各種大宗農產，均應先繳入農倉，除合作社社員自用部份外，由統制機構依合理價格配售之。</p>
<p>國營農塲，應暫以示範性推廣性之農塲爲限，俟辦有成效，再行逐步擴展，我國農地在江南各省，多係水田，且人口衆多，不能採行大規模之機械耕種；卽能之亦不合於經濟之原則，故不宜大量舉辦此項國營農塲。如確能發生不範及推廣作用，應多予農村各合作社及合作農塲以推廣之便利。至　人私營農地，應以合作社合作農塲或國營農塲所不宜經營之零星農產</p>
<p>漁業畜牧，除屬於農村副業部份外，應由政府指導各該業人民組織合作社辦理，並應附帶辦理加工設施。造林除公有林外，亦得組織造林合作社經營。因爲漁牧人民，均有一定區域，生活艱苦，由於生產性質及地域關係，最易受中間人之剝削；故應指導組織合作社經營之林塲，可由各級政府經營，但各縣及各鄕村之小規模林塲，宜於採用合作組織。至於農林漁牧之關鍵事業，如農業機械及農業病蟲藥劑之製造，鋸木之機械設備，漁業之漁船及冷藏庫，牧業之加工及屠宰設備，在合作社未能自力經營以前，應暫先由政府舉辦或協助合作社辦理。</p>
<p>民生日用品之產製，應由各地消費合作社或聯合社設置合作工廠經營；工人亦得組織工業生產合作社與農業合作社及消費合作社構成三角形之配合。緣消費合作社爲消費者之組織，以之經營生產，必可達貨眞價實之目的。消費合作發達之國家如英倫及瑞典等，其消費合作社所供應之物品，均爲其所設大規模工廠之產品。工人自己組織之工業合作社，則能改善勞工地位，使其變雇工爲廠主，以防止工潮之發生。同時，以其爲工人自己之組織。或可减少物力之浪費，並提高生產之效率，同時，合作工廠及工業合作社應個別或聯合設　倉庫，受政府這統制，其產品除社員或廠員自用部份外，均由統制機構，依合理價格配售。</p>
<p>國營工廠，應以示範性統制性之工業及各種重工業之工廠爲限，其產品及技術之爲合作社所需要者，應儘量予各社以便利。我國國營工廠尚未十分發達，此後應舉辦者尚多；惟過去因限於經費及貸款，復以民營工廠之反對，故未能充分擴展。近且有將原有國營工廠轉讓民營之議，此完全由於財政金融之錯誤觀念，應卽予以糾正。但國營工業甚易趨於衙門化，致形成各種浪費，自應力求避免。</p>
<p>私營工廠一律須經政府特許，並派員監督其生產與收益，現有工廠之由私人經營者，應分別加以整理或歸併，並派員監督其生產與收益。此項工廠之出品，除自用部分外，亦應先繳送政府指定之倉庫，由統制機構依公平合理之價格配售·</p>
<p>手工藝爲不合現代化標準之工業，惟在過渡時期，仍應予以維護。良以我國各地均有特種手工藝，雖已時代落伍，但各地勞力過剩，如不加維護，勢必失業，且此項手工藝，亦不無藝術意味，在出口物資中，爲各國所最缺乏競爭者，故在過渡時期，仍有　護之價值。</p>
<p>各種重工業除有關國防秘密者外，均應獎勵國際投資，定期完成。重工業需要鉅額資本及高度技術，自應獎勵國際投資，但各部門均應有中國專門人員，參加工作，並應規定各種製造技術，必須絕對公開，外國專家，並應負責訓練中國專門學習人員，使其能自力製造。（下接四版）</p>

<p>〔本報漢口廿二日電〕總統宣佈引退謀和後，此間各界對當局之忍讓爲國，一教表示推宗，僉認此種誠意感格，當大有助於和平前途。最先盼求和平之鄂省人民代表及地方紳耆，刻正計劃推派代表，先與華中共軍司令劉伯誠洽談和平問題，故雖迭傳豫南鄂北共軍調動頻繁，但武漢人心仍極安定，金銀黑市及日常物價今又略現回跌。</p>

<p>〔本報蘭州廿二日電〕蔣總統引退消息抵此，物價下挫，某報號外售六十元，仍不乏顧主。</p>
<h3>蔣總統宣吿引退後　美各界反應不一　國會議員多認美有責任</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕官方與政治觀觀察之目光，廿一日俱集中於中國方面，對蔣總統引退之反應不一，有認爲中國或將獲致若干類似和平者，以至有認爲蔣總統之離京將「有禍患」者。茲列舉各方之反廄如下：</p>
<p>國務院方面，正式講來，「幷未發表意見」。但國務院中目前得勢者流，對蔣總統之冷淡，久已爲公認之事。</p>
<p>議會方面，參院外交委員會主席康納利否認此舉爲國民政府終止之謂。渠希望「中國仍可產生强大政權，促成遠東之安定」，</p>
<p>力主援華之共和然參議員周以德稱，美國負有一部份責任，美國應干涉共黨促成停戰。</p>
<p>行將出任衆院外委會主席之勃魯姆稱，渠希望中國將產生領袖一人，而使戰事勝利，勃氏復稱，如果獲致一項解決，成立有共黨參加之聯合政府，則渠不贊成現在和平解決。渠稱「中國尚未全敗，如中國成立新政府，挽救中國免於赤化之時尚未過遲」。</p>
<p>參議員勃羅斯特稱，「根據歷史，蔣氏之引退將被認爲吾人時代中之大悲劇」。</p>
<p>向國會提出全面援助國民黨法案之麥羅稱：「此爲吾人袖手旁觀政策之結果」並稱：「蔣總統之引退如引起聯合政府之成立，則渠所提出之法案必須予以收回或加以修正。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕美國官方正密切注意中國蔣總統突然引退所引起之局勢，國會方面雖有人指摘杜魯門穗統未能積極援蔣抗共，但白宮與國務院均暫守緘默。據權威方面暗示，反共政府一日有在，國會所撥援華經費一日保存，美國將繼續援華，中國一旦完全被共黨控制，美國熊度如何，實爲美國外交政策之一謎。新任國務卿艾契遜今日匆匆視事，預料中國局勢將首先受其注意。聞經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼擬　艾氏及　會議，討論目前與將來之計劍。</p>
<h3>麥帥表示頗悲觀</h3>
<p>〔合衆社遠東總經理房恩東京二十二日電〕此間美國及中國高級方面廿二日以相當悲觀的情緒，接獲蔣總統的引退離京，以及中國政府加緊佈署對共和談的消息。此等人士的一般意見如次：（一）代理總統李宗仁能與共產黨圓滿聯合的機會，極屬渺茫，因爲共黨曾再三强調，他們有意擴展其政略至全中國，而其目的則在與蘇聯密切合作。（二）共產黨勢將認爲蔣總統的「暫時引退」，表示南京方面準備接受他們的條件，因此，不願緩和他們以前所宣佈的條款。</p>
<p>麥帥對此項局勢’未加詳述，因爲中國並不包括于其職權範圍之內，但渠顯然極表悲觀，認爲中國全部大陸勢將納入蘇聯的軌道之中。</p>
<h3>英外部未作評論</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿一日電〕接近英外交部各界對於蔣總統之引退，迄今未作任何評論，惟彼等認爲由於中共與國民黨和談結果所成立之新政府，此僅爲南京政府所同意之一種憲法上的變遷，不致發生各國予以新承認問題，假使以武力攫得之政府，則恐不免將發生此問題，官方各界皆謂中共政府若能履行在國際公法下照例接受之合於憲法的需要，則彼等自不反對予以承認。</p>
<h3>港僑胞且驚且懼</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港廿二日電〕蔣總統引退之消息，此間中英文報紙皆於首頁刊載，人民獲悉之餘，且驚且懼，此間各中文報紙則對此事皆特撰長篇社論</p>
<h3>法官方不感驚異</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿二日電〕此間法官方接獲蔣總統離京消息並不感驚異，法官方希望與共方談判和平條件及組成新政府能順利進行，法官方普遍表示對法國在華人民及財產無担憂之必要，渠等相信中共必能履行其保護之諾言，法國各晨報上甚少對此事之許論，做將來自中國消息以較尋常爲大之篇幅登載而已。</p>
<h3>蘇尚未披露消息</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿一日電〕迄廿一日傍晚止，蔣總統引退事尚未在此公佈。報章及電台整日忙於記述列寗逝世廿五週紀念事，自十九日公佈毛澤東之和平條件而不加評述以來，卽未刊載中國方面消息，蘇報章對蔣總統之熊度大約不致在數日內披露。</p>

<h3>亞洲會決議要求安理會　恢復印尼全部主權　令荷蘭於本年底前撤軍幷交出行政權　與會國考慮成立泛亞聯盟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿二日廣播：新德里訊：亞洲會議今夜召開秘密會議，已正式通過向安理會建議，要求安理會卽令印尼境內荷軍於一九五〇年一月一日前撤退，並由安理會採取必要行動，促其實現。今日與會之十九國代表，一致要求安理會授權調解委員會成其他另設之機構，擬定步驟，務求印尼區域之行政全權，於一九五〇年一月一日前交與印尼聯邦。屆時荷印關係如何，當另由雙方協商決定。十九國代表一致願爲安理會之後盾。十九國並電聯合國秘書長賴依，要求：（一）荷方立卽釋放印尼政治犯；（二）印尼共和國行使政權時，應有全部自由；（三）荷軍自去年十二月十八日後所佔爪哇，蘇門答臘及馬地拉等地區之印尼領土，應全部歸還；（四）荷方應取消經濟封鎖，（五）在本年三月前成立印尼臨時政府，（六）於十月一日前選舉代表，草擬懲法。秘密會之第二決議爲：亞洲各國對印尼問題應經常與聯合國取得聯繫。第三決議爲：要求十九國政府研究是否可以在亞洲地區成立機構，俾泛亞聯盟得以實現。本星期日將開全體大會，上述決議，將由全體大會正式確認。</p>
<h3>安理會定廿五日辯論　四國溫和建議案　印尼代表對本案表示十分失望</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿一日電〕中·美·挪·古四國廿一日正式向安理會提出建議，龥請於一九五〇年七月一日成立完全獨立之印尼合衆國。蘇聯代表馬立克立刻指出該建議爲鞏固荷蘭佔領印尼並使其成爲合法之一種「僞善」企圖。印尼代表賽姆波發表聲明，表示對四國之計劃十分失望。</p>
<p>但美代表團及其共同提議者，似深信解決印尼糾紛之計劃，蔣可獲致必要之七票多數，蘇聯亦不致引用否決權否決此議。新聞記者問馬氏渠之演說。是否卽蘇聯引用否決權之謂，馬氏表示渠將棄權而已。安理會於廿一日下午六時後不久，卽終止本日之辯論，定於廿五日下午復會。該建議　請從速恢復印尼共利國之政府行施職權之地位，但其職權範圍在開始時僅限於共和國首都日惹。印尼雖要求荷軍立刻撒退原防，但四國之建議對荷軍從速撤離印尼一節並無規定。制止目前戰事及規定成立一印尼合衆國詳細計劃之整個建議，純屬「建議」而已，未提及迫使荷蘭遵依之措置。美代表傑塞普告安理會稱：四國之計劃提出，旨在實現荷印雙方要求之「行動」。渠稱：「局部接洽之時期業已過去」。企圖迫使荷軍立卽撒離印尼之舉，或將引起嚴重困難，因此四國主張審愼與逐漸之撤退計劃。傑氏提出該計劃之大旨，復稱，問題不在「軍隊應否撤退，實在於撒退之方法與時間，撤退之舉須不致造成更大之困難」。中國代表蔣廷黻稱，印尼糾紛如欲獲致談判所得之解決，共和國領袖必須予以釋放，彼等之民政管理必須恢復。問以荷蘭是否擬用彼等自之方法獲致解決，而不使共和國爲政治單位。蔣氏稱，由荷蘭官員之聲明加以判斷，答案應爲「否」，但由荷蘭行動加以判斷，尤其爲違抗十二月間聯合國囑其停戰及釋放政治領袖一節。答案勢將爲「是」。荷蘭代表范東揚要求安理會給予充分時間，俾在評述四國建議前，先請示海牙方面之訓令。</p>

<h3>日本今舉行普選　修選人達一千三百六十五人初步投票結果當晚即可揭曉</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿二日電〕日本選民蔣於廿三日上午七時開始投票，選舉衆議員，以成立薪政府。最大之問題，卒在渠等能否使一黨在國會中佔有足够之議席，俾毋需與少數黨妥協，而能執行確定的復興計劃。蓋在戰爭結束以後，沒有一個政黨能建立一個可能執行堅强的確定的計劃的政府，日本政治上的特徵，便是重複的妥協與不斷的討價還價和鬥爭，其結果乃造成眞正的國家領導權的缺乏。選舉之結果並將顯示，日本是否將右傾，抑或墮入亞洲的共產主義陣綫。衆議院共有四百六十六席，參加競選的候潠人計一千三百六十五人。在競選中的公衆反響，一般均保持冷淡。觀察家認爲：此種現象將對極端之右翼份子及極端的左冀份子有利。日共特別已圖利用此項投票的不够踴躍，而使渠等的候選人有利，而增加渠等之力量。觀察家一般均同意日共之議席必將增加，就最近之形勢言，渠等可望獲得九席，超過原有議席四席的一倍。潠舉監督官員則急切希望選舉能趨踴躍，氣候則當屬晴朗。麥帥於廿二日發佈一項特定命令稱：在佔領軍機關及人員中服務的一切日本人，將在選舉中給予投票的機會。投票將自淸晨七時開始至晚間七時爲止，計票之初步趨勢可在東京時間廿三日晚十時左右獲悉。雖然，左翼人仕競選劇烈，但一般均認爲勝利將屬於極端保守之民主言由黨，但該黨是否能獲得絕對多數則屬疑問，如該黨不能獲得絕對多數，則吉田茂將與民主黨接洽，組織新保守政府‘「白日新聞社」最近之民意調查中，預示大選之結果如次：</p>
<p>民主自由黨　二一八席</p>

<p>協同黨　二〇席</p>
<p>共產黨　九席</p>
<p>社會革新黨　九席</p>
<p>農工黨　七席</p>
<p>其他次要政黨　一五席</p>

<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿一日電〕二十一日的列寗紀念會中的主要演說者共黨機關報眞理報編輯波士比洛夫，在史達林及其他高級領袖之前稱，「共產主義是本世紀的思想中樞·榮譽·及良知。這一個新的世紀，將是擊潰資本家的世紀。」此項演說或可視爲對杜魯門總統的就職演說的答覆，因爲社魯門在演說中，斥共產主義爲虛僞哲學。</p>
<p>渠繼稱「二十世紀並非華爾街的世紀，而是全世界完成列寗主義，也就是列寗，史達林主義的世紀，」至此，聽衆乃報以熱烈掌聲，波氏打破蘇聯報紙數週來對中共的勝利所持的沉寂稱，「無數的中國人正日漸堅强，爲抵抗帝國主義而奮鬥，雖然美國的資本家武裝了他們的敵人，但人民解放軍已解放了許多人民，並正在繼續推進·這許多勝利以及在印度支那·印尼及其他地方的事實，可以證實史達林的話—殖民主義已經面臨末日了。」</p>

<h3>郵務工會建議國共兩區通郵　以青島作為郵件交換地點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自戰亂以來，政府區與共區間交通阻困，郵遞斷絕。人民於骨肉親友離散之餘，欲通訊而無從寄遞，痛苦莫此爲甚。本市郵務工會有鑒及此，爰於昨日由該會理事長王震百發表書面聲明一件，促請郵政當局迅採有效辦法實行兩區通郵，並建議暫以靑島作爲雙方信件交換地點，郵政當局對此頗爲重視。茲將該會聲明探誌於後：「全世界各國人民享有的各種自由中，通信的自由殆爲最基本和量完整的，各國憲法都明文規定條文人民有通信的自由，且非萬不得已，絕不加以限制，良以通信實爲人額發展文化維繫感情所必需，從國際上看，國際郵政公約的締約國包括了舉世各國及其殖民地，該約自一九三九年在布魯塞爾簽訂以來，雖然世局多變，但各締約國均能信守不渝，從無破壞。卽使對於已失身體自由的俘膚，也明文規定特准免費寄信，足證人民的通信自由，早爲世界各國所承認，任何理由，不能予以取銷。</p>
<p>我國自有郵政，已五十年。雖然連年國家憂患紛乘，喪亂頻仍，但郵政在任何情形下，始終保持它的功能，維持通郵。抗戰七年，後方與淪陷區信件往還無阻，現在國內作戰，數年來人民反無通信自由，實爲我國郵政史上所創見。</p>
<p>本會茲願促請郵政及交通當局迅採有效辦法實行國共區通郵，以履行郵政對於人民的義務。至於技術方面，本會以爲並無十分困難。郵政對此，過去已經積有經騐，若以目前戰區遼闊，雙方陣地犬牙交錯，交通阻斷，信件無法轉遞，太會建議暫以靑島作爲雙方信件交換地，各派專人，組設機構辦理通郵事宜，以後再視交通情形逐漸擴展至全國·本會同人願就本身崗位，支持此一計劃的實現。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕江寗路警分局刑事股周巡官，日前獲悉有全生祥者，居住林森西路曹家宅十一號，與陳根新者（六十一歲，上海人，業銅匠，居愚園路漁光邨一二四號），有毒品白粉二十兩出售，需黃金卅六兩成交，乃據情報吿股長林德銘，經林股長設法備妥黃金，一面飭周巡官喬裝顧客，幾度與全生祥接洽，曾相約在各大舞廳及菜館等處會晤。比至十六日上午十時許，由同黨王永安者，將白粉一包，偕本地人張龍海（四十一歲，開設柴行），送至陳根新家，再由陳送貨至林森西路曹家宅全寓，幷約於是日午後一時半許，雙方在善鐘路上海新邨加油站成交，屆時林股長飭警員徐錦堂·秦開瑞·王華强·朱伯森·穆鴻祺等化裝三輸車夫及拾荒等，四週埋伏，一面飭周巡官手持黃金一束，守候於加油站旁，未幾陳根新果單身到來，四顧無人，卽向襟內探出白粉一包，授與周巡官，周亦遞送黃金交彼。林股長乃一聲暗號，伏警　擁上前，將陳犯擒獲，復至愚園路陳之家中搜查，結果並無所有，不得已加派員警留守，至薄暮六時左右，有同黨陳鵬飛（本地人，卅八歲，在南京西路一七四九號開設米店），致電陳寓詢問款子如何，經員警回稱已如數收到，須臾陳果偕張龍海到來，遂一併擒獲，帶局盤詰後，據供斯項白粉，由居住梵皇渡路一二六一號王永安處買來，遂按址馳往，將王犯獲案，供稱白粉來源，係由名小王者批來，小王現住徐家匯老街牛奶棚附近某號，但遍查該號幷無其人，全案人犯計有六人，除在逃全生群，和小王兩名外，餘均就逮。當於昨日下午四時，將人贓併送地檢處懲辦。</p>

<p>中國航空公司中綫班機，定爲每週一班，日前乘中航機赴日觀察之上海記者四人，業於廿二日搭乘中航班機返滬。</p>
<h3>中國新經濟政策之具體辦法　（上接第二版）</h3>
<p>（三）交通與公用</p>
<p>全國性交通事業，應依規定幹綫，積極完成，並以國營爲原則；但交通器材之製造，仍可獎勵國際及國內之私人投資。查各國之獎勵國際投資者，大都限於若干區域，以免洩漏國防秘密，全國性交通事業，旣不適宜於民營，亦不可委託外人經營，惟交通器材如汽車，輪船，飛機，及電信用具之製造，則不在此限。</p>
<p>地方性交通事業與公用事業，以由地方政府經營爲原則，必要時得酌採官督民營之方式。現在我國各地交通事業及公用事業，亦有民營較公營爲更有成績者，但此係人力財力物力之强弱問題，在原則上交通及公用事業，關係當地人民福利，不能以盈利爲目的，故以由政府公營爲宜；惟我國公營事業工作效率甚低，自應力求改進。</p>
<p>（四）貿易與物價</p>
<p>國內貿易，以由消費合作社及遝銷合作社配合進行爲原則。各種民營事業中，以商業爲最雜亂，並足以爲害社會；今日物價問題之嚴重，實以商業制度之不良爲其生因，如能普設消費合作社供應日用必需品，並由政府核定售價，其弊自除。因消費合作作社爲消費者所組織，決無自願提高物價，以增加其負担之理，不若商人之處處以營利爲目的。至運銷合作社，以其爲生產者所組織，雖或願意提高售價，但因社員均爲農民，只求避免中間剝削，已可增加收入不少，亦可免過分之要求。</p>
<p>合作社主要物品之售價，應由政府邀同合作社代表議定，以力求公平合理爲原則，如政府爲某種原因必須特別减低時，由政府對合作社補貼之。私人商業應以非必需品之經政府核准者爲限；現有各種商店，應舉行總檢查，其無存在之必要者，取消之，其店員經訓練後，可轉入消費合作社，予以適當之工作。</p>
<p>國際貿易以由政府經營爲原則，並應以全力求其平衡，非有同額出口，不准進口，其爲我國合作社所生產供給國外合作社之需要，或爲國外合作社所生產供給我國合作社之需要者，得經政府之特許，由合作社直接辦理進出口。國際貿易關係國際收支之平衡及外匯之管理，必須收歸國營，合作社之國際貿易，因較有系統，易於管制，且因合作社之價格制度不同，年終可依交易額分配盈餘，於外匯收入有利，故可准其直接經營。</p>
<p>（五）金融與財政</p>
<p>新經濟政策之幣制，應定爲紙幣本位制，但仍應維持外匯之一定比率。我國幣制混亂，至於今日，似巳至非改用實幣或繼續兌金不能維持幣値之勢。但中國金銀不多，只有兌出沒有收回，何能持久？况存金旣少，兌換自不能放手做去，故物價之高漲，幣價之低落，仍爲母庸誶言之事實。與其沒有實力兌現，何如不兌。如物價管制有辦法，實幣本位是不必要的·在本位之下，金銀爲貨物之一種，惟爲表示幣値之穩定，除維持紙幣基本物價之穩定外，仍宜維持金銀價格之穩定。政府爲維持金銀價格之穩定，除保持相當數量之金銀條，維持整條官價，不准零星賣員外，應以增加出口减少進口充裕外匯來源爲主要方法。</p>
<p>銀行以國營爲原則，私人銀行之有特殊歷史及成績經政府特許者，得繼續經營，其餘一律歸併或撤銷之。任何社會化經濟制度之國家，其銀行均以國營爲原則，因銀行爲執行經濟國策之主要工具；但商業銀行目標不同，管制困難，必難期其能執行新經濟國策之任務。</p>
<p>銀行貸款，應以實施社會化新經濟政策之計劃爲目標，凡爲計劃所規定且能有效運用者，均應充分予以貸放。我國今日之金融政策，因無物價管制之配合，故不放款，則恐生裔陷於停頓；多放款，又恐頭寸太鬆，物價高漲，使主辦銀行之人員，惑覺啼笑皆非。我國近年經濟建設之一無所成，此亦一重要原因，其實只要經濟建設，有計劃有唆效，同時物價有管制，課稅能認眞，竟可充分貸放，無所謂通貨膨脹。</p>
<p>政府收支與國際收支，必須求其平衡，並應使開源與節流並重。平衡國際收支，應預計必須進口之數量，然後以全力籌足同額價値之出口，如無法籌足時，則應再减少進口數量，至政府收支節流方法，論者已多，貴在實行，姑不　述。開源方面，只要營業所得稅，個人所得稅，關稅，及國營事業能够辦好，就可以不成問題。我國過去稅收，對豪富執行不力，職員中飽太多，加以物價飛漲，收入逍不上支出，此爲失敗主因，以後如能以革命手段，切實糾正些三點，自可達於平衡。</p>
<p>政府應建立公債信用，發行高利短期公債或金公債，以活發財政。如物價管制果能有效，同時並限制私營事業，限制私產收益，則購買公債，將成爲運用資金之正常方法，發行金公債爲收回黃金之一方法，如恐人民不願以黃金購買公債，則可予金公債以低利抵押貸款之特殊權利。如恐到期不能兌現，則可循環發行，以新公債收入之黃金，償還舊公債，並可將債債所需黃金列入出口預算或責成金公債之抵押貸款，首應用於增加出口物資之生產。祗須外匯充足，卽無虞金公債之不能償還</p>

<h3>調車伕大意京滬綫出事　崑山站撞車客車多誤點</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿二日電〕今晨六時卅分，自常州駛赴南翔之專車一列，停靠於崑山站時，該站有一機車頭正擬駛往加水，不意道軌扳錯，竟撞於該列車後部，雖車廂損失尚微，惟軌道毀壞甚重，經積極搶修，至九時廿分始吿完竣，各次上行列車均誤車達三小時餘·</p>

<h3>總工會緊急會議　商重點配米價格　顧及下期指數　不再堅持減低</h3>

<h3>各方多持觀望態度　物品市塲大體平穩　黃金公債發行日期猶待決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕總統退休對於上海市塲之反響，遠不如預期之劇烈。金融性物品開盤時略跌，但旋卽回昇，敗盤與前日行情相彷彿。棉紗價格，亦甚平穩·米糧價格，反見上漲，白粳市塲交易價格爲每祖一六四〇元，較前日上漲一百元，豆油生油漲跌互見，彼動至微。</p>
<p>業中人指出物價之所以未見大跌者，主因爲對於幣値缺乏信心，及中共反應之不明，商人均持觀望，不敢進行大規模之交易。</p>
<p>又訊：據金管局負責人表示：金融業目前均有充分準備，頭寸極爲寬裕，舊歷年關以內，決不致發生意外事件。該局爲防物價之波動，已會同有關機關密切監視中。</p>

<h3>貨主繼續扳高　食米稍見上升　粉麩油糧市塲今起休假</h3>
<p>米市略見上漲，因上日其他物價上漲甚多，貨主繼續扳高，但因產地報價尚平，故出戶仍見踴躍，初開提升七八十元，中市因出多而略疲，收市價較上日軋升五六十元不等。北市塲白粳價開一千七百二十元，計漲五十元，薄稻早稻挺百元，高薄稻一千七百元。南米市塲白粳漲六十元，早薄稻各漲五十元，糯米雖亦稍升，但銷路殊呆，昨日二市塲到貨六千三百二十七石。</p>
<p>麵粉　開市平平，旋因業外物價上漲，人心轉堅，亦卽提升，但昨日因市塲交易爲舊曆年內最後一天，故進出均屬不多。老車粉初開爲六百五十元，後卽開六百七十五元，計漲二十五元。兵船粉爲六百五十五元，漲三十三元。紅蜂及建成上漲較多，各挺三十五至三十八元大包麩皮四百八十元，計漲二十六元。</p>
<p>雜糧　轉趨下疲，尤以黃豆因上日挺升過鉅，漢口車豆昨日退做一千一百元，下降百元，九江冬豆微挫二三十元，杜豆平定，苞米售戶尚多，價疲五六十元。揀靑高貨未開，次貨一千〇五十元，紅糧稍加三四十元，芝蔴·生仁·均平疲·昨日交易因値年終最後一天，故成交寥寥。</p>
<p>食油　價格先漲後回，終則稍見軋升，早市因圈外價報升，貨主扳高，豆油開七千八百元，但後市因散戶乘高了售，廠方亦有開出，乃吿下疲。豆油收市七千四百元，略升一百元，生菜油一度曾到六千三百元新價，收市五千九百元，軋漲二百元。吉桶生油因原價太高，故獨降五十元。小車蔴油收市六千六百元·豆餅供求均多，價格平定。</p>
<p>米業休市　舊曆年終食糧市塲循例休市，雜糧·粉麩·食油·市塲，於本月二十二日截止交易，二十四日仍集市而作了結手續。南北二米市塲則於二十六日起休市，各糧市同定二月二日開市。</p>
<h3>銀根稍轉緊俏　暗息略見上升</h3>
<p>本市銀根，昨晨由弛稍稍轉緊，各業市塲暗息，均略見高升，平均在五十元左右，橡膠市塲，因市勢較秀，一度曾高達六角以上，食糖市塲，則做四十五元至五十元，紗布市塲，做價亦高，曾達六十五元。一般拆借，均甚困難，據聞此中原因，係受日來若干行莊及商行不穩消息影響之故，又國行重貼現及日拆利息，昨晨仍維原價不動。</p>

<h3>調齊年關鈔荒　國行將增發百元券</h3>
<p>日來本市現鈔籌碼，又見枯缺，市塲交易，至感不便。謠傳中央銀行將利用此一機會，正式發行五百元票面通貨一說，該行發行局副局長陳延祚氏，昨晨於接見聯合徵信所記者時，正式予以否認，陳氏解釋目前之現鈔恐慌原因稱：舊曆年關轉瞬卽屆，各工商機構，因發放年終獎金，故須大量現鈔。且一般市民，於歲尾年頭，亦均需儲備若干現鈔，使市塲流轉之現鈔，大爲减少。國行方面除於日內已撥出大批現款濟急外，並擬於一二日內，增發中央印製廠印行之百元票面新鈔一種。</p>
<h3>小型工貸審查會　改期明日舉行</h3>

<h3>桐油交易呆滯</h3>
<p>桐油邇因農曆歲暮將屆，同業大都無意授受，入於休止狀態，致交易漸趨停頓，過程亦轉平靜。價格方面，足度白油與正牌西洪，公會牌價均爲四千元，餘如副脾西洪及靑油，隨之納入正軌</p>

<h3>本客幫納胃轉稀　棉紗趨勢盤旋　利賣消息盛傳布市下游</h3>
<p>紗市呈盤旋之勢，舊歷年關將屆，客帮大多暫止辦貨，本街實銷亦見减色，且以大局將有轉變</p>
<p>賣買雙方互以爲慮，但銀根因客地游資不斷湧至，易鬆難緊，人心仍有振作，結果各紗大多站住原檔未動。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳，初由七六〇〇〇元之低檔開出，旋喊高至八三〇〇〇元，收市八一〇〇〇元，與前軋平。四〇支藍鳳微升一五〇〇〇元，以七六五〇〇元結束。三二支銀月略降五〇〇元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨由五九〇〇〇元步昂至六一〇〇〇元，午收復回小至五八〇〇〇元，與上日無上落，廠單低二五〇〇元，爲五〇〇〇〇元，套利二天期做三〇〇〇元。二〇支各檔均吿鬆落，一六支以下各級則榮辱互見。</p>

<h3>絲綢一致續疲</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市勢軟弱，散多了結，業內銀根轉緊，暗息先高後低，市上脫意轉濃，各檔均見軟化</p>
<p>一二〇號天橋初以八五〇〇〇元下週一期票喊做，旋因金價回小，業外紗布報跌，人心由昂轉低，市勢一度軟弱，低盤於七八〇〇〇元七九〇〇〇元間，小後銀根大都軋平，暗息亦見回低，檯面逢小抵補，軟勢又見盤升。惟因年關迫近，客銷不動，好後仍乏起色，收市吐售仍多，喊價再趨低游，終以七五〇〇〇元結束，各檔全面下挫。</p>

<p>足球甲組聯賽第二循環首幕靑白對羣力，昨日午後二時半在逸園演出，觀衆寥寥，不足千人，結果四比一靑白大勝。羣力撥球，進攻遇阻，靑白五鋒挺進，小羅中塲撥交劉體寅，脚下擺渡，小顧竄上十碼處力叩，應聲入網，一對零首開紀錄。羣力誓復失地，陸芳奎邊陲起義，挑向中央，余木森頭頂，黃仕傑輕舒　臂，接個正着，孫煥文興兵犯關，亦吿野逸，靑白再振攻勢，小羅兩射均未建樹，至廿八分鐘，薛沛然得金祿生派司，在廿碼處牛刀小試，又吿中的，二對零。再陷一關，羣力臥薪嘗膽，羣策羣力，阮龍生沿邊疾疋，準時傳向中央，孟義良不及返防，余木森十碼處輕輕一撥，扳回一城，上半時以二對一結束。</p>

<h3>隴上幣災</h3>
<p>— 本報記者宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州十八日航訊〕自從「八一九」提高了銀幣的身價以來，這半年的人民生活，確是像泥河一樣流，而銀幣在甘肅，先由偸偸摸摸的暗中作崇，織而明目張膽的掀風作浪，最近半月來，幾乎氣焰萬丈的要翻江倒海了。由她所引起的種種災書，激盪着各階層的人羣，中下級人民被捲在幣災的漩渦裏，幾乎有隨時減頂的危險。</p>
<p>一個斛斗身價百倍</p>
<p>「八一九」改幣時，甘肅的銀幣黑市，蘭州是法幣五百萬元左右，（邊遠的縣份只到三百萬元）那時官家把她的身價抬高到法幣六百萬元，但也注定了她的命運，永遠打入冷宮，不得重見天日。曾幾何時，她又在徐可亭部長手下超生，一個斛斗，現在的身價已是金圓券一百三十元，折合法幣要值三億九千萬，「身價百倍」對她已不再是形容詞，而是千眞萬確的寫照。</p>
<p>黃牛蠢動轉移目標</p>
<p>最近，這一次的銀潮是由存兌開始的，經辦的銀行發出二百個兌換證，（按：每證只准兌四十九枚銀元）竟兌出五萬多枚銀幣，把局外人弄得像「丈二的和尚，摸不着頭腦」，在極短的時期內，把庫存兌個罄盡，還愚弄公教人負排隊登了一天記，結果次日起停兌，叫這羣薪給階級空喜歡一塲。「黃牛」們眼看銀行裏軋不出銀元了，於是轉移目標，向外縣謀出路。</p>
<p>小鈔奇缺大鈔貼水</p>
<p>本來外縣小鈔就奇缺，在存兌進行的當兒，外縣的市塲上便發生大鈔貼水的現象，一張五元的金圓券，祗可當三張一元券使用，拿六·七元一元票面的金圓券，可以兌換到一張十元券。於是一元一張的小鈔，頓時受人靑睞，蘭州的黃牛黨看看有利可圖，便就地吐出大量銀幣，軋回小鈔，四散到外縣去套兌投機，幣風所及，銀幣黑市如浪濤汹湧，向來以銀幣漲落作標準的生活必需品價格，也給攪得亂七八糟，蘭州市面上，一時竟無緣再睹一元券金圓小姐的芳容，買起東西來，起碼是五元，十元，否則賣主會拿「沒法找零」來拒顧客於千里之外，有些商店，竟乾脆按銀幣標價了。</p>
<p>隴南郵差忍饑挨冷</p>
<p>在隴南一個小縣份裏，曾發生過這樣兩個小故事：隴西某早班郵差領到的薪水，儘是五元·十元的大鈔，他要運一批郵件到另外一縣去，局長深恐他領的大鈔無法使用，特給他換了一元一張的郵票十元，以便沿途零星售成小票使用，誰知沿途各郵政代辦所都不想拿小鈔購郵票，某郵差無奈，只好忍饑挨冷的掙扎到目地。</p>
<p>庫存不足拒兌小鈔</p>
<p>另一個故事：隴南某縣縣府曾派人持大鈔千元左右，向該縣某銀行兌換一元券小鈔，銀行以庫存不足謝絕，縣長又派財政科長前往交涉，仍未如願，縣長大爲震怒，而銀行主任表示庫存小鈔，有賬可查，銀行並未私自動用，如縣府不予諒解，渠卽掛冠他去。</p>
<p>央行設法外運濟用</p>
<p>一週前中央銀行曾有包機一架，運來一元券小鈔一百四十餘萬元，該行鑒於小鈔在市面的流通價值，比起她本身被人當作商品的價值來得小，遂決定與「黃牛」鬥法，把一百萬不鈔，利用省銀行和郵局的分支機構，先分配到蘭市周圍百里以內的小縣份去，免爲黃牛追逐吞納，變成銀鈔投機的工具。其餘的四十餘萬元，與市商食，省銀行商定合理分配辦法，流通本市，使市塲不再發生找零的困難。不過，省銀行在折息極高的情形下，不願擲出道筆鉅款去兌換小鈔，另外還有分運外縣的還費問題，還沒有出處，看來小鈔荒一天不解決，深陷在幣災中的人民也無法喘口氣，郭主席軫念民隱，已再三催促央行從速設法，外運濟用了。</p>
<h3>配合建設加強生產　甘肅合作事業　有「一日千里」之勢</h3>
<p>甘肅的合作事業，在國內算是較爲發達的省份，這是由於甘省特產豐富，交通不太發達等條件促成的。但人爲的因素也不可忽視，如地方人士的熱心努力，郭寄　主席的賢明倡導，才使甘肅的合作事業的進展，有「一日千里」之勢。</p>
<p>合作事業的工作範圍，分組織·業務·金融·教育等四項，以組織·金融·教育爲開展工作的手段，而以業務的發達推進建設爲目的，業務方面農業合作生產總值爲八十六萬餘元，工業合作生產總值爲卅二萬餘元，消費合作總值爲三萬九千餘元，畜牧合作計配種羊三萬餘隻，小型水利受益農田十二萬餘畝，土地改良（舖砂）受益農田二萬餘畝，新興的甜菜製糖事業，已成立合作社卅七所，種植甜菜面積三千多畝。棉花生產合作種植面積五萬六千餘畝，計產棉五十七萬五千餘斤，此外，軍公教人員的合作社，共組成一百六十七所，舉辦特產運銷合作總值八萬七千餘元。合作金融在合作金融方面：自去年七月份起，到八月十九日停止貸款，使合作事業極受影響。各合作社於去年發起增股運動，全省合作社股金額已達七千餘元，各金庫股金總額達三十一萬元。合作教育方面：去年共訓練合作人負十一萬人以。農工業務甘肅合作事業目前所遭遇的困難，是物價波動及資金缺乏，合作幹部也因事業日益擴展而感到不够，所以甘省合作管理處擬定今年的工作計劃，在業務方面，將側重農工業的生產。農業的生產，如稻麥。菸葉。藥材。大　·棉花等的增產，並側重造林。奇牧及小型水利·農由舖砂·甜菜製糖等等的推進，工業的生產，仍繼續推行羊手標準化，品種改良及蔴·毛編織物的推廣等，此外如紡織·皮革·榨油·造紙·簡易化學生產，也將與西北羊毛改進隊，西北獸疫防治隊，甘肅化工廠等有　機關，切取配合，逐步推進。加強建設在金融方面，今年將確立「合作會計制度」，實　合作貸款，暫定七千萬元，設法增加各級合作資金廿萬元，增認金庫設金五萬元，並儘量訓練合作人員，在各縣舉辦短期的合作講習會·</p>
<p>甘省地瘠民貧，一切物資大部仰仗外來，所以欲建設新甘肅，首先應加强推行建設事業，如發展交通，擴大水利，增加生產等，俾能達到自給自足的境地，所謂「地盡其利，人盡其力。」</p>
<h3>黔省食鹽缺乏　谷正倫電綏署呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿一日航訊〕貴州省主席谷正倫對黔省食　缺乏事，綏　頃接長電呼籲，聲稱：「自限價開放後，百日內鹽價漲五十三倍，亥東公佈鹽價，筑倉價每担五七八圓七八分，外縣當不止此。黔省每月銷鹽十一萬祖，計一月購買價，卽需金圓六千餘萬圓，該時黔省金券發行數字，據央行報告尚不及半數。以全省發行額完全作　錢用，尚不能買半數，非但黔民淡食，鹽倉存鹽亦無法銷售。運商不能售慶，則無資赴塲再購。故於萬分無計中，商鹽局將卅七年十二月份以前應配各縣總額，准照戌皓定價每担以三十三圓七七分，除國稅外，加息百分之六〇·四三，於一個月內飭縣趕速購運，逾期不再配售，實係暫時維繫人心，倘照　局定價，人民實無力量購運，欲求解決，捨國行貸款，無以爲計。又據黔鹽局報告，運商共十七家，三土七年承運額爲八一五儎又二三零，迄今運倉僅二儎·至以前鹽價從未核减，鹽運遲緩，純係官商勾結，已電中央請予澈底解決。」</p>

<p>政府首長之開「支票」者，不論「空頭」與否，比比皆是，而任顯羣以備忘錄親送參會作爲「信用支票」，却頗罕見。據任氏自己的解釋，這是本諸他素所主張和從行的「責任政治」。當任氏就任之始，任氏曾對記者表示，說他不願做官，但想做事。因此，他出任杭州市長，不願做一個普通的行政官，而是以辦事業的態度來辦行政，爲杭州市民來做一點事。杭州某報曾誤記爲將以辦營業的態度來辦行政。任氏特別對記者解釋：「我特別重視辦事業，因爲辦行政可以敷衍，辦事業要負責任。譬如侯家源局長造浙贛鐵路，他就不能拖，必須造通，如果他要拖，造不通，換句話說，負不起責任，他便得走。我做杭州市長，也是如此，如果我不能辦事，我就滾疋。」他的話說得又乾脆，又堅決。</p>
<p>兩項原則</p>
<p>任顯羣蒞任之初，並沒什麼計劃，他說：「須看客觀條件如何，不過我有二大原則，卽必須爲多數市民服務和必須把握重點，脚踏實地的做去」。後來，在一月十七日的市的參議會施政報告中，他更申述：「要爲大多數市民服務，政府的施政就必須謀多數市民的利益，解除或减輕多數市民的痛苦，舉有餘以補不足，以實行民生主義爲施政的目標。因此，他一面要使市內的農民耕者有其田，市區空屋必令其出租，使人人能安居樂業，一面則對少數特權階級的利益，稍予限制，使市民生活能臻於較平等的地位。</p>
<p>最初兩炮</p>
<p>因此，任氏上任以後，接收了市府全部貧血而近乎麻痺的機構之後，他自已先改變前任的作風，不到城站迎送佳寶，不到樓外樓歡宴應酬。同時，就實際需要，略爲調整機構，整肅陣容。其辦事，則自上任伊始，卽表現了苦幹實幹而又大刀闊斧的硬派作風，他爲要奠定辦事業的基礎，充裕市府的收入，首先向刁商開刀，提高營業稅額，（非稅率）二十倍。這是驚人的一砲，許多人却說：任市長的第一砲恐將失敗，但是結果，雖然開罪了商界鉅子，他却成功了。他的驚人的第二砲，開向稅收人員。在杭州，稅收稽征處的外勤人員中，據說有所謂「四大金剛」，「十三太保」者，當然，那是稅政　上的污點。任氏據報後，立刻召集全體訓話，限在二周內舉出「四大金剛」和「十三太保」的名字來，如果如限未報，全體一律撤職。結果，十四天很快地過去，「金剛」和「太保」們還是杳無音訊。於是，大刀闊斧地，把全體外勤全部撤職了。從這兩件事上，很可想見任氏行政的作風。雖然，有參議員公開說他「硬幹」，有商界大亨公開駡他應該滾蛋，但是就靠他這樣大刀闊斧的整頓稅收，澄淸吏治，市財政始能略有基礎，不再赤字連串，而公教人員的配米和薪水始能如期發給，建設事業始能逐步開展。</p>
<p>八項公務</p>
<p>任氏將怎樣逐步開展其建設事業呢？本諸爲多數市民服務和脚踏實地的原則，他底第一張信用支票是下列八件事：</p>
<p>（一）依杭市地理環境和市民需要，於三月底前完成現代都市建設之設計，以爲今後政府市民共同努力之目標。</p>
<p>（二）充實市立中學一所，市立小學一所中心國民學校十六所，務使在圖書儀器等設備上完全符合教育部所規定之標準。</p>
<p>（三）增加自來水用八八百戶，其裝置標準以貧民用戶及用水量最多而尚無充足自來水設置之區域爲主。</p>
<p>（四）翻修街巷二十四條，如何先後，則悉聽各區公所決定。</p>
<p>（五）添置淸肥車輛，杜絕沿街糞担。</p>
<p>（六）添置垃圾車指定垃圾站，淸除積污，改善環境衛生。</p>
<p>（七）設計利用冀便垃圾製造肥料，於三月底前開始出貨。</p>
<p>（八）植樹三百萬株，蘊蓄水量，培養風景。</p>
<p>符合方針</p>
<p>從這個計劃看，倒是可以符合任氏的二大方針：爲多數市民和脚踏實地的。記者曾聽好些杭州人說：「別說翻造廿四條，祗要像皮市巷這樣的臭小街翻造好一條，我們也願爲任市長造功德牌坊了」。這可見杭州市民對杭州的現狀是多麼不滿意，尤其對於小街巷，下水道和用水的遠離標準，更是日夜怨聲載道的。周市長在日，所謂「三條馬路，一口西湖」，不顧城內小巷小街，自來水公司成立迄今，從未增加供水用戶。因此，當任顯羣上任之日，許多人都希望他不做西湖市長而眞能做杭州市長。如今，任氏總算不負衆望，他能把建設杭州放在前面，建設西湖放在其次，把做事放在前面，把做官放在後面。</p>
<p>可取之點</p>
<p>任氏的責任政治，還有可取的兩點：其一是能廣取民意，其一是遇事能立刻解決。誰都知道任氏是愛跳舞，喜歡玩的，但這是他的「美國作風」。他在辦公的時侯，可完全二樣。不僅辦公室內如此，他的辦公時間最長，卽在晚間有事，他也能爲了迅謀解決，工作到晚上三四點鐘。如流亡學生的處理，浙贛路局釀醞的八千人大罷工，都因他底能迅謀解決，而得以保持杭市的安定。任氏的新花樣，在市府添設市民接見室。今年並將舉辦「民意測騐」，「空中信箱」之類，俾可與廣大的市民羣能有廣泛的聯繫，從中採納民意。最近，爲了應該把杭州建設成怎樣一個都市的問題，他也公開徵求意見，俾能以市民的意見爲依　。</p>
<p>依歸</p>
<p>杭州究宜建爲一個怎樣的城市？本報亦歷有文字刊載，其主旨大抵是以文化爲重心。在此時會，侈談這樣的計劃、，似屬空虛，但以任氏脚踏實地的作風，我們深願任氏能切實爲杭州市民謀福利外，幷願以同樣的精神，及努力，來建立杭州使成爲全國人民精神上的家鄉，藝術文化的重鎭。</p>

<h3>Acting President Li's Announcement to the People: Resolving to Seek Peace with Utmost Effort, All Laws and Decrees Contradicting Democratic Principles Will Be Swiftly Abolished</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Acting President Li today (22nd) issued the following announcement: President Chiang Kai-shek has resolutely retired. Zongren, mindful of the righteousness of saving the country and its people, has stepped forward to shoulder this arduous task. The suffering of the nation and its people from the current war has reached an unbearable level. Seeking peace to end the war is the unanimous cry of the entire nation. At the beginning of my tenure, I wish to inform all my fellow countrymen that the government will, from today, seek the realization of peace with the utmost sincerity and effort. I know this task is exceptionally arduous, but for the sake of the country and its people, Zongren will do everything possible to achieve it. As long as peace can be realized soon and the country can embark on the path of peaceful reconstruction, Zongren will not consider his personal advancement or retreat. This sincere heart should be witnessed by all fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>After eight years of war against Japan, followed by three years of civil war, not only was the glimmer of hope for national revival after victory in the war against Japan completely destroyed, but the scourge of war spread throughout both north and south of the Yellow River. Fields and homes were destroyed and abandoned. The deaths and injuries of innocent people numbered in the tens of thousands. Wives were separated from their husbands, children scattered, and cries of hunger and cold were heard everywhere. This catastrophic calamity is unprecedented in our country's civil war history. Our commitment to the National Revolution was originally to save the country and its people. We should end the war as soon as possible and bring about peace and harmony so that we can preserve the vitality of the nation and leave a chance of survival for the people. Otherwise, if the war continues to drag on, the country will be plunged into an abyss from which it can never recover. Now that the whole country is unanimously calling for peace, not only is the government determined to respect public opinion, but the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has also expressed its willingness to negotiate. Based on this same belief and sincere heart of forbearance for the sake of the country, no matter how difficult the future may be, Zongren believes that peace will eventually be realized.</p>
<p>Now, to show sincerity and determination, the government will remove all obstacles to peace. All past laws and actions that have hindered the people's freedom and contradicted democratic principles will be swiftly abolished or suspended, in order to foster a peaceful atmosphere in the country and allow the peace talks to proceed smoothly. As for the eight conditions proposed by the CCP, the government is willing to start negotiations immediately. Representatives have already been appointed. Once the CCP responds with a location for negotiations, the peace talks can be held. Furthermore, in order to gather wisdom from all sources and make the task easier with everyone's support, Zongren has also sent telegrams inviting all political parties and peace-loving individuals in society to provide their support. In short, from now on, the government's work will focus on striving for the realization of peace, and my personal service will be guided by the will of the people. I also hope that all my fellow countrymen will work together to achieve this great undertaking. The future of the nation is deeply dependent on it.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Held an Extraordinary Political Affairs Meeting Yesterday: The Peace Negotiation Delegation Was Appointed, Including Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Peng Zhaoxian, Huang Shaohong, and Zhong Tianxin; They Will Depart Immediately After the CCP Proposes a Negotiation Location</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] In order to swiftly seek the early realization of peace, the Executive Yuan convened an extraordinary political affairs meeting at 6 p.m. on the 22nd to discuss and decide on the selection of members for the delegation to negotiate with the CCP. After smooth passage at the meeting, it was decided that Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Peng Zhaoxian, Huang Shaohong, and Zhong Tianxin would form the delegation, with Shao Lizi as the chief representative, responsible for leading and convening meetings of the delegation and planning negotiation methods. As for the departure date and negotiation location, it was decided to be "a suitable location agreed upon by both parties," but it is hoped that the CCP can propose a location as soon as possible, so that the delegation can travel there as soon as possible. After the Executive Yuan's decision became known to the general public, their hope for peace became even more ardent.</p>
<h3>Mr. Shao Expresses His Thoughts</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Mr. Shao Lizi, the chief representative of the delegation appointed by the Executive Yuan to negotiate with the CCP, met with reporters on the evening of the 22nd and expressed his thoughts after accepting the mission. Mr. Shao first stated: "I feel very apprehensive upon receiving this order and believe that the delegation's mission is extremely arduous, but I am determined to do my best to achieve the goal of peace." Mr. Shao said: "There have been many years of rifts between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, leading to this cruel war. The recent expressions made by both sides (referring to the President's New Year's Day message and Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation) are far apart, so this mission will be extremely difficult. However, since peace is urgently needed by everyone, and it is even more necessary to preserve the nation's vitality, both sides have now seen this point. I believe that if everyone is sincere, peace can be achieved." Mr. Shao emphasized: "Therefore, I also feel that this mission is achievable. The members of the delegation will definitely do their utmost to promote the smooth progress of the peace talks so that the war can end as soon as possible." Regarding the location of the negotiations, Mr. Shao said that we sincerely hope that the CCP can reply as soon as possible, especially by proposing a location for negotiations, so that the negotiations can begin as soon as possible. When reporters asked whether a ceasefire would be the first issue discussed after the negotiations begin, Mr. Shao said no. As for the procedure and basis for the negotiations, he believed that neither the conditions proposed in the President's message nor the conditions in Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation could be insisted upon, otherwise, the talks would not be able to continue. Therefore, all issues will be discussed after the negotiations begin. Mr. Shao's mood was very cheerful today. During his conversation with reporters, Mr. Shao received a phone call from someone who claimed to be a small citizen of Nanjing. This citizen undoubtedly admired Mr. Shao's efforts to promote peace and heard about his new mission today. He only asked Mr. Shao one question: "Is there hope for peace?" Mr. Shao replied, "Everyone hopes for peace, so there is hope for peace." As the reporters were leaving, Mr. Shao added, "I hope not to disappoint everyone's hopes and to achieve the goal of peace."</p>

Despite my limited abilities, I have taken on this arduous task. I can only do my best to promote the realization of peace. We have known each other for a long time, and this sincere intention should be understood. The CCP has expressed its willingness to negotiate. If we can forbear for the sake of the country, success will not be difficult to achieve. I am not only willing to make the greatest effort, but also have unlimited confidence in this. You, brother, have been advocating peace for many years with painstaking effort, which is admired by the whole country. At this time of hardship, I ask you to provide detailed guidance to follow. If you can invite democratic and peace-loving individuals from the north to come to Beijing together to discuss and promote this, to comfort the expectations of the public, and allow me to relinquish my responsibilities early, it would be my greatest hope. This special telegram is sent to await your virtuous reply. Your younger brother, Li Zongren. (January) Yang (22nd) Secret Seal."</p>
<p>(2) "To Mr. Bojun and Dongsun and all gentlemen of your league: Eight years of war against Japan, three years of civil strife, the nation's vitality has been almost exhausted. I, with my limited abilities, am trying to support the precarious situation. I deeply know that only by ending the war and seeking peace can we save the people from fire and water.

And to show my determination and sincerity, the government has decided to abolish and suspend the laws and actions that have hindered the people's freedom in the past. The CCP has now expressed its willingness to negotiate. If we can forbear for the sake of the country, success will not be difficult to achieve.

<h3>The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party Hope to Complete the Great Task of Peace</h3>

<h3>Specific Measures of China's New Economic Policy</h3>
<p>— Shou Miancheng</p>
<p>(The eight principles of the New Economic Policy were published on January 10th. The specific measures are now published below.)</p>
<p>(1) Property and Income</p>
<p>China's New Economic Policy should implement a socialization of private property system, maintaining the private ownership of property while restricting its scope and benefits. Those that must be nationalized due to special reasons are not subject to this restriction. For example, public ownership of land and other property is indeed a system, but some property is earned through labor, while some is obtained through luck or speculation. It is difficult to be fair and reasonable if all are nationalized. Moreover, before the people's socialization concept is formed, it will inevitably have a negative impact on production efficiency. Furthermore, the problem of the property system is not just about ownership, but about the right to use and enjoy. If various restrictions can be placed on the owner, then maintaining the private ownership system can be said to be beneficial and without harm.</p>
<p>The income of the people's work shall be determined according to the quantity and quality of their work. All people of working age and with working ability should engage in work that is beneficial to society. Those without work opportunities shall be allocated by the government. Regarding the income of each person, some previously advocated equal treatment for all. This system is unreasonable and will lead people to not work hard, which is extremely detrimental. Soviet Russia once adopted it, but soon abolished it. What all people should equally enjoy is the minimum standard of living permitted by the level of social production. However, those with stronger abilities and more work must be given a standard of living above the minimum to be motivated. Some say that the strength of ability is not innate. This is another question. Although the level of ability should be universally improved in the future, after the level of ability is improved, income may also increase accordingly, which is still fair. However, society still constantly needs to encourage special abilities; otherwise, the level of ability will not be able to be promoted forward.</p>
<p>People who are not of working age or lack the ability to work should be provided with a minimum standard of living by the government, or temporarily borne by those in society with surplus income. The elderly, young, disabled, and pregnant women in society, although they have no work income, still have to maintain their lives. The cost of this living should be borne by the government in principle; however, in Chinese society, due to the large population, the lack of women's working ability, and the special family system, if all expenses are paid by the government, it will only increase unnecessary burdens. It seems that it can be stipulated that only when the number of people borne by income below a certain standard exceeds a certain standard can government subsidies be requested.</p>
<p>The increase in population should be adjusted to be compatible with the productivity of land and resources.</p>
<p>All people in the country who are of working age, have the ability to work, and have access to work should join social insurance so that the living expenses of those who are unemployed, sick, and deceased can be provided.</p>
<p>(2) Agriculture and Industry</p>
<p>Agricultural raw materials for daily necessities and agricultural products necessary for life should be produced by farmers organizing township and town cooperatives, family production cooperatives, or cooperative farms. The most appropriate way for farmers to organize cooperatives to sort out land rights, improve land use, promote excellent varieties and technologies, and develop farmland water conservancy and rural sideline industries is through cooperative organizations. There are precedents in various countries, even Soviet Russia is no exception. Cooperative farms should be based on adjacent fields with the same water conservancy needs to facilitate the sorting out of boundaries and the construction of water conservancy facilities.</p>
<p>Each cooperative and cooperative farm should individually or jointly set up agricultural warehouses under the control of the government. All kinds of bulk agricultural products should first be paid into the agricultural warehouses, and the control agency shall allocate and sell them at reasonable prices, except for the part used by the members of the cooperative.</p>
<p>State-owned farms should be temporarily limited to demonstrative and promotional farms. After successful operation, they should be gradually expanded. In the provinces south of the Yangtze River in China, most of the farmland is paddy fields, and the population is large, so large-scale mechanized farming cannot be adopted; even if it can, it is not in line with economic principles. Therefore, it is not appropriate to hold a large number of these state-owned farms. If it can indeed generate demonstration and promotion effects, the rural cooperatives and cooperative farms should be given more convenience in promotion. As for private farmland, it should be limited to sporadic agricultural products that are not suitable for operation by cooperative farms or state-owned farms.</p>
<p>Fisheries and animal husbandry, except for the part belonging to rural sideline industries, should be handled by the government guiding the people of each industry to organize cooperatives, and processing facilities should be attached. In addition to public forests, afforestation can also be operated by organizing afforestation cooperatives. Because fishermen and herdsmen all have a certain area and lead a hard life, due to the nature of production and geographical relationship, they are most vulnerable to the exploitation of middlemen; therefore, they should be guided to organize cooperative operations. Forest farms can be operated by governments at all levels, but small-scale forest farms in counties and villages should adopt cooperative organizations. As for the key industries of agriculture, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry, such as the manufacture of agricultural machinery and agricultural pest and insect drugs, sawmilling machinery and equipment, fishing boats and cold storage for fisheries, and processing and slaughtering equipment for animal husbandry, before the cooperatives can operate independently, they should be temporarily operated by the government or assisted by the cooperatives.</p>
<p>The production of daily necessities should be operated by consumer cooperatives or joint associations in various places setting up cooperative factories; workers can also organize industrial production cooperatives to form a triangular cooperation with agricultural cooperatives and consumer cooperatives. Because consumer cooperatives are organizations of consumers, operating production through them will surely achieve the goal of genuine goods at fair prices. In countries where consumer cooperation is developed, such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, the goods supplied by their consumer cooperatives are all products of their large-scale factories. Industrial cooperatives organized by the workers themselves can improve the status of workers, transforming them from employees to factory owners, so as to prevent the occurrence of labor unrest. At the same time, because it is the workers' own organization, it can reduce the waste of resources and improve production efficiency. At the same time, cooperative factories and industrial cooperatives should individually or jointly set up warehouses under the control of the government. Their products, except for the part used by members or factory staff, shall be allocated and sold by the control agency at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>State-owned factories should be limited to demonstrative and controlling industries and factories of various heavy industries. The products and technologies required by the cooperatives should be given as much convenience as possible to the various cooperatives. China's state-owned factories are not yet very developed, and there are many that should be established in the future; however, in the past, due to limited funding and loans, and the opposition of private factories, they could not be fully expanded. Recently, there has even been a proposal to transfer the original state-owned factories to private management, which is completely due to the wrong concept of finance and should be corrected immediately. However, state-owned industry is very prone to becoming bureaucratic, resulting in various wastes, which should be avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>Private factories must be licensed by the government and have personnel sent to supervise their production and income. Existing factories operated by private individuals should be sorted out or merged separately, and personnel should be sent to supervise their production and income. The products of these factories, except for their own use, should also be sent to the warehouses designated by the government, and the control agency shall allocate and sell them at fair and reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Handicraft is an industry that does not meet modern standards, but it should still be maintained during the transition period. Because there are special handicrafts in various parts of China, although they are already outdated, there is a surplus of labor in various places. If they are not maintained, they will inevitably lose their jobs. Moreover, these handicrafts are not without artistic meaning. Among export materials, they are the least competitive with other countries. Therefore, during the transition period, they still have the value of protection.</p>
<p>Various heavy industries, except for those related to national defense secrets, should be encouraged to receive international investment and completed on schedule. Heavy industry requires huge capital and high technology, so international investment should be encouraged, but all departments should have Chinese professionals participating in the work, and it should be stipulated that various manufacturing technologies must be absolutely open. Foreign experts should also be responsible for training Chinese professional learners so that they can manufacture independently. (Continued on page four)</p>

The National Army's Yang Gancai's 20th Army and the 99th and 96th Armies are stationed there.

It is understood that the National Army may retreat further south to comply with the political decision to seek peace.</p>

<h3>Peace Sounds High, Prices Fall; Different Reactions to the President's Retirement in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 22nd] After the President announced his retirement to seek peace, all walks of life here expressed their support for the authorities' tolerance for the country, and generally believed that this kind of sincerity would be very helpful to the future of peace. The people's representatives and local gentry of Hubei Province, who first hoped for peace, are now planning to send representatives to negotiate peace with Liu Bocheng, commander of the Central China Communist Army. Therefore, although there are repeated reports of frequent movements of the Communist Army in southern Henan and northern Hubei, the people's hearts in Wuhan are still very stable, and the black market for gold and silver and daily commodity prices have slightly fallen again today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 22nd] Li Pinxian, Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Chairman of the Political Committee of the Central China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, invited the news media here this afternoon to discuss the main points of the current situation as follows: (1) The President's announcement of his retirement to seek peace shows the government's loyalty to the people and the country. We should concentrate our will and concentrate our strength to strive for genuine peace. (2) The Central China region once led the way to peace. We should provide as much assistance as possible to those who are beneficial to the people. Those who do not understand the true meaning of peace should be widely publicized to ensure that the opinions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are close. (3) The eight conditions proposed by the Communist Party have room for negotiation. We hope that both sides will meet each other with sincerity and promote the early realization of peace.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 22nd] After President Chiang Kai-shek announced his retirement, Cheng Qian answered reporters' questions, believing that the President's retirement was the most great and sincere expression of following public opinion and seeking peace. Vice President Li is a good comrade and an old friend. In the future, we should work together to achieve peace. Regarding the way to stabilize Hunan Province in the future, Cheng said that everyone should be upright and sincere, align their steps, and move towards the road of peace in unison, without vying to be first, which is the power of stability.</p>

Chen said: Although the President has retired, the Vice President will act as his agent and perform his duties, and the local government will still implement the instructions of the Central Government. He himself did not want to comment on the current situation. However, when the reporter asked about the Hangzhou City Council's suggestion to the Central Government and the Communist Party to designate Hangzhou City as a demilitarized zone, Chen replied that this was an outdated idea. He wanted to know that today is a domestic war, not an international war invaded by foreign tribes.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 22nd] The President retired, and prices fell sharply.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 22nd] After the news of the President's retirement came out, the local newspapers issued extra editions late last night, and every household hung flags and fired cannons this morning to express their support.</p>

<h3>After President Chiang Kai-shek Announced His Retirement, the US Responds Differently; Many Members of Congress Believe the US Has a Responsibility</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Official and political observations focused on China on the 21st, with different reactions to President Chiang Kai-shek's retirement. Some believed that China might achieve some kind of peace, while others believed that President Chiang Kai-shek's departure from Beijing would be "disastrous." The responses from various parties are listed below:</p>
<p>On the State Department side, officially, "no opinion was expressed." However, the coldness of the State Department towards President Chiang Kai-shek has long been recognized.</p>
<p>On the Congressional side, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally denied that this move meant the end of the Nationalist Government. He hoped that "China can still produce a strong regime to promote stability in the Far East."</p>
<p>Republican Senator Zhou Yide, who advocated for aid to China, said that the United States bears some responsibility and that the United States should intervene in the Communist Party to promote a truce.</p>
<p>Bloom, who is about to become Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that he hopes China will produce a leader who will win the war. Bloom also said that if a solution is reached to establish a coalition government with the participation of the Communist Party, he does not agree with the current peaceful settlement. He said, "China has not been completely defeated. It is not too late to save China from communism if China establishes a new government."</p>
<p>Senator Brewster said, "Based on history, Chiang's retirement will be regarded as a great tragedy of our time."</p>
<p>McLaw, who submitted a bill to Congress for comprehensive aid to the Kuomintang, said: "This is the result of our hands-off policy" and said: "If President Chiang Kai-shek's retirement leads to the establishment of a coalition government, the bill he proposed must be withdrawn or revised."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] US officials are closely watching the situation caused by the sudden retirement of Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek. Although some members of Congress have criticized President Truman for failing to actively assist Chiang in resisting communism, the White House and the State Department have remained silent for the time being. According to authoritative sources, as long as there is an anti-communist government, the funds allocated by Congress for aid to China will be preserved, and the United States will continue to aid China. Once China is completely controlled by the Communist Party, the attitude of the United States is a mystery in American foreign policy. The newly appointed Secretary of State Acheson took office in a hurry today, and it is expected that the situation in China will be the first to receive his attention. It is heard that Hoffman, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, plans to hold a meeting with Acheson to discuss current and future plans.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Expresses Pessimism</h3>
<p>[United Press Far East General Manager Fang En, Tokyo, 22nd] High-ranking American and Chinese officials here on the 22nd received the news of President Chiang Kai-shek's retirement and departure from Beijing and the Chinese government's intensified preparations for peace talks with considerable pessimism. The general opinions of these people are as follows: (1) The chances of Acting President Li Zongren successfully uniting with the Communist Party are extremely slim, because the Communist Party has repeatedly emphasized that they intend to expand their political strategy to the whole of China, and their purpose is to cooperate closely with the Soviet Union. (2) The Communist Party will inevitably regard President Chiang Kai-shek's "temporary retirement" as a sign that Nanjing is prepared to accept their conditions, and therefore, they are unwilling to ease the terms they have previously announced.</p>
<p>MacArthur did not elaborate on this situation because China is not within his jurisdiction, but he clearly expressed extreme pessimism, believing that the entire Chinese mainland will be brought into the orbit of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Office Makes No Comment</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 21st] Circles close to the British Foreign Office have so far made no comment on President Chiang Kai-shek's retirement. However, they believe that the new government formed as a result of the peace talks between the CCP and the Kuomintang is only a constitutional change agreed to by the Nanjing government and will not lead to the issue of new recognition by various countries. If a government is seized by force, this problem may inevitably arise. Official circles all said that if the CCP government can fulfill the constitutional requirements of accepting the usual practice under international law, they will not oppose recognizing it.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Compatriots Are Both Shocked and Afraid</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 22nd] The news of President Chiang Kai-shek's retirement was published on the front page of both Chinese and English newspapers here. The people were both shocked and afraid after learning about it. The Chinese newspapers here all wrote long editorials on the matter.</p>
<h3>French Officials Are Not Surprised</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 22nd] French officials here were not surprised to receive the news of President Chiang Kai-shek's departure from Beijing. French officials hope that the negotiations on peace terms with the Communist Party and the formation of a new government can proceed smoothly. French officials generally expressed that there is no need to worry about French people and property in China. They believe that the CCP will fulfill its promise to protect them. There are few comments on this matter in the French morning newspapers, but they have published more extensive reports from China than usual.</p>
<h3>Still No Disclosure from the Soviets</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Moscow, 21st] As of the evening of the 21st, President Chiang's resignation had not been announced here. Newspapers and radio stations were busy all day commemorating the 25th anniversary of Lenin's death. Since the announcement of Mao Zedong's peace terms on the 19th without commentary, no news from the Chinese side has been published. The Soviet newspapers' attitude towards President Chiang will probably not be disclosed within the next few days.</p>

<h3>Asian Conference Resolves to Request the Security Council to Restore Full Sovereignty to Indonesia, Order the Netherlands to Withdraw Troops and Hand Over Administrative Power by the End of This Year, Participating Countries Consider Establishing a Pan-Asian League</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] New York, 22nd (Radio): New Delhi Dispatch: The Asian Conference held a secret meeting tonight and formally passed a recommendation to the Security Council, requesting the Security Council to order the withdrawal of Dutch troops from Indonesian territory before January 1, 1950, and to take necessary actions to promote its realization. The representatives of the 19 countries participating today unanimously requested the Security Council to authorize the Mediation Committee or other newly established body to formulate steps to ensure that full administrative power in the Indonesian region is handed over to the Indonesian Federation before January 1, 1950. How Dutch-Indonesian relations will be at that time will be decided by both parties through consultation. The representatives of the 19 countries unanimously expressed their willingness to support the Security Council. The 19 countries also telegraphed UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, requesting: (1) the Netherlands to immediately release Indonesian political prisoners; (2) the Indonesian Republic should have complete freedom in exercising its political power; (3) the Indonesian territory in Java, Sumatra, and Madura occupied by Dutch troops since December 18 last year should be fully returned; (4) the Netherlands should lift the economic blockade; (5) an Indonesian Provisional Government should be established before March of this year; (6) representatives should be elected before October 1 to draft a constitution. The second resolution of the secret meeting was: Asian countries should maintain constant contact with the United Nations on the Indonesian issue. The third resolution was: The governments of the 19 countries are requested to study whether an organization can be established in the Asian region to enable the realization of a Pan-Asian League. A plenary session will be held this Sunday, and the above resolutions will be formally confirmed by the plenary session.</p>
<h3>Security Council to Debate Four-Nation Moderate Proposal on the 25th, Indonesian Representative Expresses Great Disappointment with the Proposal</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 21st] The four countries of China, the United States, Norway, and Cuba formally submitted a proposal to the Security Council on the 21st, calling for the establishment of a fully independent United States of Indonesia on July 1, 1950. Soviet representative Malik immediately pointed out that the proposal was a "hypocritical" attempt to consolidate the Dutch occupation of Indonesia and make it legitimate. Indonesian representative Sjamsoeddin issued a statement expressing great disappointment with the four-nation plan.</p>
<p>However, the US delegation and its co-sponsors seemed confident that the plan to resolve the Indonesian dispute could obtain the necessary seven-vote majority, and that the Soviet Union would not use its veto to reject the proposal. When reporters asked Malik if his speech meant that the Soviet Union would use its veto, Malik said he would abstain. The Security Council adjourned today's debate shortly after 6:00 PM on the 21st and is scheduled to reconvene on the afternoon of the 25th. The proposal calls for the prompt restoration of the authority of the Indonesian Republic's government, but its scope is initially limited to the Republic's capital, Yogyakarta. Although Indonesia has demanded the immediate withdrawal of Dutch troops from their original defenses, the four-nation proposal does not stipulate the prompt withdrawal of Dutch troops from Indonesia. The entire proposal to end the current hostilities and to provide a detailed plan for the establishment of a United States of Indonesia is purely a "recommendation" and does not mention measures to force the Netherlands to comply. US representative Jessup told the Security Council that the four-nation plan was designed to achieve the "action" requested by both the Netherlands and Indonesia. He said: "The period of piecemeal negotiations is over." Attempts to force the immediate withdrawal of Dutch troops from Indonesia could cause serious difficulties, so the four countries advocated a cautious and gradual withdrawal plan. Jessup presented the main points of the plan and added that the issue was not "whether troops should withdraw, but the method and timing of the withdrawal, which must not cause greater difficulties." Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu said that if a negotiated solution to the Indonesian dispute is to be achieved, the Republic's leaders must be released and their civil administration must be restored. Asked whether the Netherlands intended to achieve a solution in their own way, without allowing the Republic to be a political entity, Chiang said that judging from the statements of Dutch officials, the answer should be "no," but judging from Dutch actions, especially their defiance of the UN's December request to cease hostilities and release political leaders, the answer would inevitably be "yes." Dutch representative Van Dongen requested the Security Council to grant sufficient time to consult with The Hague on instructions before commenting on the four-nation proposal.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 21st] China, the United States, Cuba, and Norway jointly proposed to the Security Council today that Indonesia be fully independent by July 1, 1950. The contents of the four-nation joint proposal are as follows: (1) Immediately cease all military actions; (2) Release all political prisoners and restore their full freedom; (3) Establish an all-Indonesian "Provisional Federal Government" before March 15, 1949, hold free general elections before October 1 of this year to establish an Indonesian Constituent Assembly, and hand over all Indonesian political power to a United States of Indonesia before July 1, 1950; (4) Reorganize the Security Council's Mediation Committee into an Indonesian Committee to supervise the implementation of this proposal and to oversee the gradual handover of territory to the Indonesian government.</p>
<h3>Japan to Hold General Election Today, 1,365 Candidates Running, Preliminary Voting Results May Be Announced Tonight</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 22nd] Japanese voters will begin voting at 7:00 AM on the 23rd to elect members of the House of Representatives to form a new government. The biggest question is whether they can enable one party to hold enough seats in the Diet to implement a definite recovery plan without having to compromise with minority parties. Since the end of the war, no party has been able to establish a government capable of implementing a strong and definite plan. The characteristic of Japanese politics has been repeated compromise and constant haggling and struggle, resulting in a lack of genuine national leadership. The outcome of the election will also show whether Japan will lean to the right or fall into the communist camp of Asia. There are a total of 466 seats in the House of Representatives, and 1,365 candidates are running. Public reaction to the election campaign has generally remained lukewarm. Observers believe that this phenomenon will favor extreme right-wing elements and extreme left-wing elements. The Japanese Communist Party has particularly tried to take advantage of this lack of enthusiasm to make their candidates favorable and increase their strength. Observers generally agree that the number of seats held by the Japanese Communist Party will definitely increase. In the current situation, they can expect to win nine seats, more than doubling their original four seats. Election supervisors are eager for the election to be enthusiastic, and the weather is expected to be clear. MacArthur issued a specific order on the 22nd stating that all Japanese nationals serving in the occupying forces' agencies and personnel will be given the opportunity to vote in the election. Voting will begin at 7:00 AM and end at 7:00 PM, and preliminary trends in the vote count can be obtained around 10:00 PM Tokyo time on the 23rd. Although leftists are campaigning vigorously, it is generally believed that victory will belong to the extremely conservative Democratic Liberal Party, but it is doubtful whether the party will be able to obtain an absolute majority. If the party fails to obtain an absolute majority, Yoshida Shigeru will contact the Democratic Party to form a new conservative government. A recent public opinion poll by the "Mainichi Shimbun" predicted the results of the general election as follows:</p>
<p>Democratic Liberal Party: 218 seats</p>
<p>Socialist Party: 91 seats</p>
<p>Democratic Party: 89 seats</p>
<p>Cooperative Party: 20 seats</p>
<p>Communist Party: 9 seats</p>
<p>Social Renovation Party: 9 seats</p>
<p>Labor-Farmer Party: 7 seats</p>
<p>Other Minor Parties: 15 seats</p>
<p>Independents: 8 seats</p>
<h3>Gunfire Heard on North-South Korean Border, Syngman Rhee Reiterates Territorial Claim to Tsushima Island</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 22nd] Officials announced today that gunfire had broken out on the border between South and North Korea, possibly due to an internal rebellion in North Korea. Details are unknown.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 21st] According to a broadcast from Seoul Radio, South Korean President Syngman Rhee stated that since the United Nations has the greatest responsibility for resolving the Korean issue, the UN Commission on Korea should ensure the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea and cooperate with us to disarm the North Korean army. If not, this issue should be left to us to resolve ourselves. He also stated that the South Korean government's territorial claim to Tsushima Island remains unchanged. This claim will be directly negotiated with the Japanese government and may be decided by an international conference in the future.</p>
<h3>Western European Defense Plan Drafted, Five Countries Organize Allied Forces to Defend Territory from the Netherlands to Switzerland</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] The defense ministers of the five signatory countries of the Brussels Treaty met on the 14th of this month to draft a European defense plan, with a defense line stretching from the Netherlands to Switzerland. The meeting also decided on the number of troops that each country should provide for joint defense in the event of war. The plan will be submitted to the Western European Union's foreign ministers' meeting in London on the 25th. This defense line will be defended by highly mobile forces including French, British, Belgian, Dutch, and Luxembourgish troops when needed. This army will be composed of 30 mechanized divisions and five armored divisions supplied by France, and three mechanized divisions, one air force brigade, and armored units supplied by the Netherlands and Belgium. All three units will have appropriate air support to defend their territory. The meeting also drafted a plan to build strategic highways and equip North Sea ports to facilitate the supply of fuel needed by the Allied forces. The five defense ministers also achieved significant results in standardizing the equipment of the five countries' armed forces. Furthermore, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will manufacture war materials in their domestic factories, and US arsenals will also provide necessary weapons to assist them.</p>
<h3>Bao Dai Demands Complete Autonomy for Vietnam</h3>
<p>The French Government Is Seriously Studying This</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Usually reliable diplomatic sources said on the 21st that the United States is greatly encouraging Britain and France in Far Eastern affairs to cooperate with President Truman's policy of supporting new democracies in Asia, as outlined in his inaugural address. The sources said that for this reason, Britain and France have agreed to cooperate with the United States on its Indonesian policy in the United Nations, although British and French officials are deeply sympathetic to the Netherlands' position. They said that the possibility of France allowing most of Indochina to become independent under former King Bao Dai is very obvious, and the French government is now seriously studying Bao Dai's conditions, which include the freedom to establish Vietnamese embassies in Washington, New Delhi, and other places, to determine foreign policy, and to have complete control over the military. It is said that only under these conditions will Bao Dai be willing to return to Vietnam. The French government may have already made a decision, but the matter that needs to be seriously considered is the reaction of a substantially independent Indochina on French North Africa, especially the protectorates of Morocco and Tunisia. However, some French government officials have already believed that Bao Dai's conditions should be accepted.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hanoi, 20th] Nguyen Van Xuan, the prime minister of the French-protected central government of Vietnam, told Associated Press reporters today: "I plan to fly to Paris this spring to consult with the French government on the issue of the restoration of King Bao Dai." Nguyen also answered other questions as follows: Question: Will the French government take strong action against the Viet Minh delegation in Paris? Answer: The Viet Minh delegation's presence in Paris is purely a matter of French domestic policy, and we have no right to interfere. Question: Will the Vietnamese government be reorganized immediately? Answer: I will consult with Bao Dai first before answering.</p>
<h3>Tito Replies to Soviet Union, Moscow's Propaganda Offensive Will Not Change Yugoslavia's Course</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Belgrade, 21st (United Press)] Marshal Tito recently told the Serbian Communist Party Congress that the Moscow radio station is conducting a multi-faceted propaganda campaign against Yugoslavia, an attack comparable to Hitler and Goebbels' attacks on the communist Soviet Union in the past. Tito said that the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries are now working together against Tito himself, which is the first time Tito has formally acknowledged the criticisms made against him by the Moscow radio station. Tito said that he himself, his party, and his country will continue on the same course, regardless of attacks from the East or West, and will urge the Cominform to promptly cancel its propaganda offensive. He added: "After six months of struggle with the Cominform, we can see how firm and solid our party is. No attack can harm it or break up its ranks."</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Breaks Silence on Chinese Situation, Praises Success of Leninism, Pospelov's Speech Targeted at Truman</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Moscow, 21st] Pospelov, editor of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda, the main speaker at the Lenin Memorial Meeting on the 21st, said in front of Stalin and other senior leaders, "Communism is the intellectual center, honor, and conscience of this century. This new century will be the century of defeating capitalists." This speech can be regarded as a reply to President Truman's inaugural address, because Truman denounced communism as a false philosophy in his speech.</p>
<p>He continued, "The twentieth century is not the century of Wall Street, but the century in which the whole world completes Leninism, that is, Leninism-Stalinism." At this point, the audience responded with warm applause. Pospelov broke the Soviet newspapers' weeks-long silence on the victory of the Chinese Communist Party and said, "Countless Chinese people are becoming stronger and fighting to resist imperialism. Although American capitalists have armed their enemies, the People's Liberation Army has liberated many people and is continuing to advance. These many victories and the facts in Indochina, Indonesia, and elsewhere prove Stalin's words—colonialism is facing its end."</p>
<h3>Italian Communist Leader Criticizes Truman's Speech</h3>
<p>Accuses It of Disguising Imperialism</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 21st] Italian Communist Party Secretary-General Togliatti told reporters from "Repubblica" today that in President Truman's speech, "what he did not mention is more interesting than what he has mentioned. His anti-communist policy is an abstract matter and has no political value. In fact, the policy of the American imperialist bloc has reached a crisis, because its policy is increasingly contrary to the wishes of democratic people and governments." Nenni, the leader of the Socialist Party, which holds a majority in parliament and supports communism, said, "Truman's speech cleverly disguised imperialism with empty declarations of humanity and principles. The collapse of British and American imperialism in China is a response from the people and events to certain people who still believe that they can make the world adopt positions and concepts that are historically outdated."</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Eliminate Differences, Hope to Promote Middle East Peace, Britain Will Recognize Jewish State in Exchange for US Recognition of Transjordan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st] Diplomatic sources predicted today that Britain will recognize Israel within days, and the United States will recognize Transjordan at the same time, which will be enough to eliminate the two countries' differences on Middle East issues and promote peace between Jews and Arabs. The outside world pointed out that the United States attaches importance to the interests of Jews in Palestine, and Britain supports the interests of Arabs. This can be answered by this move.</p>
<h3>Egyptian-Jewish Negotiations Progress</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rhodes, 22nd] Well-informed sources said that during the negotiations between Israeli and Egyptian representatives on the night of the 21st, the conflicting opinions between the two sides on the demarcation of the Nitzana armistice line were eliminated as a result of Bunche's mediation. Although the results of this meeting remain secret, it is heard that both sides have made more progress in reaching an agreement than before. The same sources also said that Egypt has abandoned its original demand that Israeli troops must withdraw to the lines of October 14. In other words, Israel has given up Nitzana. On the other hand, the Jews are not forcing Egypt to withdraw from the Palestinian territory that it still occupies. It is heard that both sides are close to Bunche's proposal, which maintains the current occupation line and makes slight changes at certain points when necessary for military considerations.</p>
<h3>US and Saudi Arabia Promote Envoys</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 21st] The United States and Saudi Arabia have agreed to mutually upgrade their legations to embassies. The new US ambassador to Saudi Arabia has not yet been appointed, and the current US minister is J. Rives Childs.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Commission Does Not Intend to Change Japanese Purge Regulations</h3>
<p>US Expresses Surprise at Japanese Request</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] According to well-informed sources, the Far Eastern Commission is satisfied with the handling of the purge of extreme nationalists in Japan. Therefore, the Far Eastern Commission has not considered changing the basic policy on the purge. Tokyo news reports said that Yoshida Shigeru's political movement recently requested relaxation of the purge regulations. It is said that even if Yoshida Shigeru's efforts to promote change receive some government sympathy, it will not affect existing measures, because this policy was decided by the Far Eastern Commission. Government officials expressed "surprise" at the Japanese request to relax the purge regulations. They said that compared with the purge of Nazis in Germany, the Japanese purge process is "the most gentle."</p>
<h3>Truman Decides to Implement Democratic Party Platform, Will Make It Law</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] President Truman recently said that he will do everything possible to make the Democratic Party platform law and frankly declared that the platform is not "pie in the sky." This was announced by Truman at a reception hosted by Democratic Party Chairman McKellar after his inauguration. Earlier, Truman had criticized the Soviet Union as a dictatorial system and not a truly communist country.</p>

To prevent speculation, the government has ordered the stock exchange to close until Monday. The bonds will be issued in denominations of 10,000 francs each. Bondholders can exchange half of their old bonds for new bonds.</p>
<h3>Number of Overseas Chinese Entering Siam Has Not Exceeded Quota</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 21st] According to a Thai immigration official, since the Siamese government stipulated the total number of immigrants from all countries entering Siam on January 1, the number of Chinese people entering the country has not exceeded half of the quota, and most of them are in transit or traveling in Siam, staying here for no more than a month. Therefore, they cannot be considered newly arrived immigrants. The official also said that all Chinese who arrived in Siam without proper passports have been repatriated to China. Most of the Chinese entering the country come from Shantou and Hainan Island. Most of them are family members of overseas Chinese here. Because they were unaware of the new passport regulations announced by the government on December 31 of last year, they were detained by the Thai immigration authorities earlier this month.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Jambi Suffer in Indonesian-Dutch War</h3>
<p>Houses, Property, and Food Mostly Burned or Confiscated</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 22nd] The "Tiensheng Daily" here reported that the total losses suffered by overseas Chinese in Jambi, South Sumatra, in the recent Indonesian-Dutch conflict amounted to 16 million rupiah. According to an investigation by our consulate in Palembang, Dutch troops burned down 390 houses belonging to overseas Chinese and looted 107 shops on New Year's Eve last year. In addition, 500 tons of rice and 2,000 bags of flour belonging to overseas Chinese merchants were also confiscated by Indonesian troops, who then retreated into the mountains. Seven local overseas Chinese were killed and two were injured in the fighting with the Dutch army. 3,800 overseas Chinese were homeless and more than 7,000 were in urgent need of relief. Our consul Chen Yuan-ping personally went to Jambi to inspect the aftermath relief work.</p>
<h3>Rumors that Acheson Firmly Advocates Replacing US Military Commander in Germany, Pownall Succeeds as British Commander in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] There are rumors that Secretary of State Acheson firmly advocated to President Truman to replace the commander-in-chief of the US military in Germany. Today, the "Washington Star" reported that Truman may give this position to former Under Secretary of the Army Draper, and the current commander-in-chief, General Clay, will be ordered to return home next month. Some political circles here believe that Clay's return home can materialize the recent improvement in US-Soviet relations. Well-informed sources claim that President Truman has decided to eliminate military influence in the core of foreign policy. The decision to recall Clay can be seen as an indirect appeal to the Soviet Union, hoping that it will propose concrete conditions for a "peace offensive." However, the general opinion here is that the task of the US commander is extremely delicate, and Clay's successor will find it difficult to cope.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 21st] General Pownall, who succeeded General Herbert as commander of the British forces in Berlin, told reporters today that the policy of the British military government in Berlin will not change due to the change of commander. Pownall served in the Far East during the war.</p>
<h3>US and Venezuela and El Salvador Restore Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 21st] The United States today restored diplomatic relations with the governments of Venezuela and El Salvador. The previous government of Venezuela was overthrown due to riots on November 24 last year. The previous government of El Salvador was overthrown due to similar riots on December 14. Thereupon, the military took over the administration of the two countries. The new government was established and requested that diplomatic relations with the United States be maintained. The US State Department said today that the United States restored relations with the above two countries after consulting on this topic for several weeks with other countries in the Americas and Europe.</p>
<h3>French-Japanese Trade Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 22nd] According to an official announcement here today, trade negotiations between France (including overseas colonies) and Japan will begin in Tokyo on the 24th. According to Allied sources, the negotiations will determine the quantity, value, and nature of transactions. As for the trade settlement between the two sides, it will be based on the settlement agreement concluded in July 1948, with the US dollar as the standard. It also said that France has purchased 12,000 bales of raw silk from Japan and intends to continue to purchase more raw silk. This issue will be one of the main issues in the current trade negotiations. On the contrary, Japan hopes to purchase raw materials from French colonies.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Yesterday morning, presidents Zhang Yi, Xia Jianbai, Chu Fengyi, Ou Yuanhuai, etc., of twelve universities including Fudan, Tongji, Shanghai Law, and Great China, went to the City Hall to meet with Mayor Wu, hoping that the authorities would handle the case as soon as possible in accordance with the law, as the nineteen students detained in the Penglai Road Police Station for five months, who are currently on a hunger strike, have neither been prosecuted nor released.

<h3>Resolution of Wage Dispute for Cigarette Piece Workers as Determined by the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Most of the piece workers in the city's cigarette industry are female, totaling about 50,000. Since last December, factories have gradually suspended operations and stopped paying wages, causing financial difficulties. They have repeatedly requested the authorities to mediate. The employers believe that piece workers have never been paid during shutdowns, so they refuse to pay. The workers insist on receiving living allowances. The case has now been adjudicated by the Joint Commission, with the main points of the solution being: (1) If the factory is still in a state of suspension and has not started work for a single day in January, the factory will subsidize each worker 50 cents per day, totaling 15 yuan for the whole month. (2) If the factory has been operating for 20 days or more in January, the workers will not receive any additional subsidies. If it is less than 20 days, the factory will subsidize the workers 50 cents per day for the remaining days, in addition to the wages actually earned for the working days. (3) The standard working time per day is nine hours. If it is less than nine hours, the factory will subsidize the workers five cents per hour. (4) If the worker's wage and subsidy income in January is less than 15 yuan, the factory will also pay the full 15 yuan. According to Director Shen of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, the main aim of the above measures is to guarantee the workers' minimum living standards.</p>
<h3>Most Barbershops Have Not Resumed Operations</h3>

<h3>Military and Political Authorities Host Journalists to Affirm Determination to Ensure Public Security</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the publication of the President's abdication announcement, the military and political authorities of this city have stated that the primary task of this city in the future is still to ensure public security first. Mayor Wu Guozhen and Garrison Commander Chen Daqing jointly hosted journalists in the City Hall conference room at 5 p.m. yesterday. Mayor Wu first delivered a speech, stating: After the President's abdication, Vice President Li has taken over. The peace talks issue is a major central plan, and peace or war must await the central government's decision. However, in this turbulent situation, local public security must be strengthened and maintained. The millions of citizens of this city pray for stability day and night. It is hoped that business and academic circles will work hard in their respective positions. If there are any actions outside the track that could disrupt public security, the authorities will handle them impartially in accordance with legal procedures. When labor disputes occur, the competent authorities should be asked to properly mediate. The government will severely punish any petty thieves or traitors who disrupt social order.</p>
<p>Commander Chen then made two points, briefly: (1) The responsibility of the Garrison Headquarters is to protect the people and maintain local public security. No matter what the environment or time, it will never easily relax its responsibilities. Anyone who undermines local public security will be severely punished. (2) Recently, there have been reports in the newspapers that the armed forces in Tianjin and Beiping have been disarmed and weapons have been laid down, which I find very painful. The military is responsible for maintaining public security. Unless they are discharged and return to their fields, they must stick to their posts and never relax their work and tasks. Therefore, disarmament is unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Liu Gongyun, New President of the National Bank, Takes Office</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mr. Liu Gongyun, President of the National Bank, took office at 10 a.m. yesterday. Mr. Liu was originally scheduled to take office tomorrow, but he moved it up temporarily because he was eager to go to Beijing on official business. The inauguration ceremony was very simple, and many guests came to congratulate him. First, former President Yu Hongjun convened the heads of the bank's various bureaus and departments and delivered a simple farewell speech, hoping that under the guidance of the new president, they would continue to work hard to serve. Then, Mr. Liu gave a speech, expressing his deep gratitude to the two presidents, Zhang and Yu, for their guidance over the past two years, and asking his colleagues to continue to assist him so that he could fulfill his responsibilities. After the speech, the new and old presidents exchanged seals and completed the handover. Mr. Liu also issued a written statement as follows: For the past two years, I have assisted Presidents Zhang and Yu, and I deeply feel that my talent and ability are limited and cannot help the current difficult times. I asked President Yu to forward my request to the central government to remove me from my position, but I was unexpectedly entrusted with an important task, which makes me extremely apprehensive. Now the central government is making every effort to promote the realization of peace, and the country's finances will gradually return to normal. During this period, I can only follow the government's financial policies, abide by the bank's established rules, and do my best to make up for any shortcomings and contribute to the national economy and people's livelihood. I sincerely hope that business and industry circles and people from all walks of life will not hesitate to correct me and grant me cooperation so that we can overcome the difficulties together. This is my great fortune.</p>
<h3>French Tramway Workers Briefly Strike; Resume Work After Persuasion; Wage Loan Issue to Be Mediated Again</h3>
<p>[Our Report] On the 19th of this month, French tramway workers requested that the employer lend them half a month's salary, to be paid by the 25th, and to be repaid in four months starting in March. The Social Affairs Bureau did not accept the case because it was a wage loan issue, so labor and management negotiated on their own. The company believes that after the index rose on the 15th of this month, it has experienced serious difficulties in paying employees' original salaries and benefits, and expressed that it cannot raise the new expenses requested by the union. Upon hearing the news, the workers' emotions ran high, and they started a strike at 2 p.m. yesterday. All trams stopped running, and trolleybuses and buses also partially stopped. Upon hearing the news, Song, the chief of the Lujiawan Police Station, immediately persuaded them, and they resumed work at 4 p.m. The wage loan issue will be mediated again after Chief Song asks his superiors for instructions. However, after resuming work yesterday, all vehicles on each line returned to the factory early, and normal operations are expected to resume today.</p>

<h3>Postal Workers' Union Suggests Mail Exchange Between Kuomintang and Communist Areas, with Qingdao as the Mail Exchange Location</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the war, transportation between the government-controlled areas and the communist-controlled areas has been difficult, and postal services have been cut off. People are separated from their loved ones, and they cannot communicate with each other, which is extremely painful. In view of this, the Municipal Postal Workers' Union issued a written statement yesterday by its Chairman Wang Zhenbai, urging the postal authorities to take effective measures to implement mail exchange between the two regions, and suggesting that Qingdao be temporarily used as the mail exchange location for both sides. The postal authorities attach great importance to this. The Union's statement is explored below: "Among the various freedoms enjoyed by people in countries all over the world, freedom of communication is perhaps the most basic and complete. Constitutions of various countries clearly stipulate that people have freedom of communication and should not be restricted unless absolutely necessary. This is because communication is essential for the development of human culture and the maintenance of emotions. From an international perspective, the contracting parties to the International Postal Convention include all countries in the world and their colonies. Since the convention was signed in Brussels in 1939, although the world situation has changed greatly, all contracting parties have been able to abide by it and have never violated it. Even for prisoners who have lost their personal freedom, it is expressly stipulated that they are allowed to send letters free of charge, which proves that people's freedom of communication has long been recognized by all countries in the world and cannot be cancelled for any reason.</p>
<p>China has had a postal service for 50 years. Although the country has suffered from continuous national crises and frequent wars, the postal service has always maintained its function and maintained postal communication in any situation. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, letters between the rear and the occupied areas were unimpeded. Now, in the domestic war, people have been deprived of freedom of communication for several years, which is unprecedented in the history of China's postal service.</p>
<p>This association now wishes to urge the postal and transportation authorities to take effective measures to implement mail exchange between the Kuomintang and Communist areas in order to fulfill the postal service's obligations to the people. As for the technical aspects, this association believes that there are no major difficulties. The postal service has accumulated experience in this regard in the past. If the current war zone is vast, the positions of both sides are intertwined, and transportation is blocked, making it impossible to transfer letters, this association suggests that Qingdao be temporarily used as the mail exchange location for both sides, and special personnel be sent to set up an organization to handle postal communication matters. In the future, the scope will be gradually expanded to the whole country depending on the transportation situation. The members of this association are willing to support the realization of this plan from their respective positions."</p>

<h3>Trading White Powder and Gold at a Negotiated Price: Police Officers in Disguise Arrest Drug Traffickers; Rice Store Owner Turns Out to Be an Accomplice</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Officer Zhou of the Criminal Division of the Jiangning Road Police Sub-bureau learned a few days ago that Quan Shengxiang, who lives at No. 11 Caojiazhai, Linsen West Road, and Chen Genxin (61 years old, Shanghainese, coppersmith, resident of No. 124 Yuguang Village, Yu Garden Road), had 20 taels of white powder (heroin) for sale, requiring 36 taels of gold to be traded. He reported the information to Chief Lin Deming. After Chief Lin managed to prepare the gold, he ordered Officer Zhou to disguise himself as a customer and contact Quan Shengxiang several times. They had agreed to meet at major dance halls and restaurants. Until about 10 a.m. on the 16th, the accomplice Wang Yong'an brought a package of white powder, together with Zhang Longhai (41 years old, local, runs a firewood business), to Chen Genxin's home, and then Chen delivered the goods to Quan's residence at No. 11 Caojiazhai, Linsen West Road, and agreed that the two parties would trade at the Shanghai New Village gas station on Shanzhong Road at about 1:30 p.m. that day. At that time, Chief Lin ordered police officers Xu Jintang, Qin Kairui, Wang Huaqiang, Zhu Bosen, Mu Hongqi, etc. to disguise themselves as rickshaw pullers and scavengers and ambush them around the gas station. He also ordered Officer Zhou to hold a bunch of gold and wait beside the gas station. Before long, Chen Genxin arrived alone, looked around and saw no one, then took out a package of white powder from his jacket and handed it to Officer Zhou, who also handed over the gold to him. Chief Lin gave a secret signal, and the ambushing police officers rushed forward and captured Chen. They then searched Chen's home on Yu Garden Road, but found nothing. They had no choice but to send additional police officers to stay on guard. At around 6 p.m., an accomplice Chen Pengfei (local, 38 years old, runs a rice store at No. 1749 Nanjing West Road) called Chen's residence to ask how the money was. The police officer replied that it had been received in full. Soon Chen arrived with Zhang Longhai and was arrested together. After interrogation, they confessed that the white powder was purchased from Wang Yong'an, who lived at No. 1261 Fanhuangdu Road. They immediately rushed to the address and arrested Wang. Wang confessed that the source of the white powder was from a supplier called "Little Wang." "Little Wang" currently lives near the milk shed on Old Street, Xujiahui, but no one by that name was found after searching the address. There were a total of six suspects in the case. Except for Quan Shenghao and "Little Wang," who are at large, the rest have been arrested. The people and stolen goods were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for punishment at 4 p.m. yesterday.</p>

<h3>China Airlines' China-Japan Line Scheduled for One Flight Per Week</h3>

<h3>Concrete Measures for China's New Economic Policy (Continued from page 2)</h3>
<p>(3) Transportation and Public Utilities</p>
<p>National transportation undertakings should actively be completed according to the specified trunk lines, and the principle of state-owned enterprises should be followed; however, the manufacture of transportation equipment can still be encouraged by international and domestic private investment. It is found that the promotion of international investment in various countries is mostly limited to certain areas, so as to avoid the disclosure of national defense secrets. National transportation undertakings are not suitable for private operation, nor can they be entrusted to foreigners. However, the manufacture of transportation equipment such as automobiles, ships, airplanes, and telecommunications equipment is not subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>Local transportation undertakings and public utilities should be operated by local governments in principle, and the method of official supervision and private operation may be adopted as appropriate when necessary. At present, there are some transportation undertakings and public utilities in various parts of China that are more successful under private operation than under public operation. However, this is a question of the strength of human, financial, and material resources. In principle, transportation and public utilities are related to the welfare of the local people and cannot be profit-oriented. Therefore, it is appropriate for the government to operate them publicly; however, the work efficiency of public undertakings in China is very low, so efforts should be made to improve them.</p>
<p>(4) Trade and Prices</p>
<p>Domestic trade should be carried out in coordination by consumer cooperatives and marketing cooperatives in principle. Among all kinds of private undertakings, commerce is the most chaotic and can harm society. The seriousness of the current price problem is actually caused by the poor commercial system. If consumer cooperatives can be widely established to supply daily necessities, and the government can approve the selling prices, the problems will be eliminated. Because consumer cooperatives are organized by consumers, they will never voluntarily raise prices to increase their burden, unlike merchants who aim at making profits everywhere. As for marketing cooperatives, since they are organized by producers, they may be willing to raise selling prices, but since the members are all farmers, they only seek to avoid intermediate exploitation, which can already increase their income a lot and avoid excessive demands.</p>
<p>The prices of the main items of the cooperative should be agreed upon by the government and the cooperative representatives, in order to strive for fairness and reasonableness. If the government must reduce the prices for some reason, the government will subsidize the cooperative. Private commerce should be limited to non-essential items approved by the government; all existing stores should be subject to a general inspection. Those that are not necessary to exist should be cancelled, and their employees can be transferred to consumer cooperatives and given appropriate jobs after training.</p>
<p>International trade should be operated by the government in principle, and every effort should be made to balance it. Imports are not allowed without the same amount of exports. If the needs of foreign cooperatives are produced and supplied by our cooperative, or if the needs of our cooperative are produced and supplied by foreign cooperatives, they may be directly handled by the cooperative with the special permission of the government. International trade is related to the balance of international payments and the management of foreign exchange, so it must be brought under state control. Cooperative international trade is more systematic and easier to control, and because the price system of cooperatives is different, the surplus can be distributed according to the transaction amount at the end of the year, which is beneficial to foreign exchange income. Therefore, it can be allowed to operate directly.</p>
<p>(5) Finance and Public Finance</p>
<p>The monetary system of the new economic policy should be set as a paper money standard, but a certain ratio of foreign exchange should still be maintained. The chaos of China's monetary system has reached the point where it seems that the value of the currency cannot be maintained without changing to real money or continuing to exchange gold. However, China does not have much gold and silver, and it can only be exchanged out and not recovered. How can it last? Moreover, since there is little gold in storage, the exchange cannot be done freely. Therefore, the high price and low currency value are still undeniable facts. Rather than not having the strength to cash out, it is better not to cash out. If price controls are effective, the real money standard is unnecessary. Under the standard, gold and silver are one kind of goods. However, in order to show the stability of the currency value, in addition to maintaining the stability of the basic prices of paper money, it is still appropriate to maintain the stability of gold and silver prices. In order to maintain the stability of gold and silver prices, in addition to maintaining a considerable amount of gold and silver bars, maintaining the official price of the whole bar, and not allowing retail sales, the government should mainly increase exports and reduce imports to replenish foreign exchange sources.</p>
<p>Banks should be state-owned in principle. Private banks with special histories and achievements that have been specially approved by the government may continue to operate. All others should be merged or revoked. In any country with a socialized economic system, banks are state-owned in principle, because banks are the main tool for implementing economic national policies; however, commercial banks have different goals and are difficult to control, so it is difficult to expect them to be able to implement the tasks of the new economic national policies.</p>
<p>Bank loans should be targeted at the implementation of socialized new economic policy plans. All those that are stipulated in the plans and can be used effectively should be fully granted loans. Today, China's financial policy does not have the cooperation of price controls, so if loans are not issued, it is feared that the economy will fall into stagnation; if loans are issued too much, it is feared that the money supply will be too loose and prices will rise, making the people in charge of the bank feel confused. This is also an important reason why China's economic construction has not achieved anything in recent years. In fact, as long as economic construction is planned and effective, and at the same time prices are controlled and taxation is serious, sufficient loans can be issued without so-called inflation.</p>
<p>Government revenue and expenditure and international payments must be balanced, and equal importance should be attached to increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. To balance international payments, the quantity that must be imported should be estimated, and then every effort should be made to raise exports of the same value. If it is impossible to raise enough, then the quantity of imports should be reduced again. As for the methods of reducing government revenue and expenditure, there are many commentators, and the key is to implement them, so I will not repeat them here. As for increasing revenue, as long as the business income tax, personal income tax, customs duties, and state-owned enterprises can be managed well, it will not be a problem. In the past, China's tax revenue was not effectively enforced on the wealthy, too many officials embezzled too much, and prices soared, so revenue could not keep up with expenditure. This was the main reason for the failure. If these three points can be effectively corrected with revolutionary means in the future, a balance can be achieved.</p>
<p>The government should establish public debt credit and issue high-interest short-term public bonds or gold public bonds to revitalize public finance. If price controls are effective, and at the same time private enterprises are restricted and private property income is restricted, then purchasing public bonds will become a normal way to use funds. Issuing gold public bonds is one way to recover gold. If it is feared that people are unwilling to purchase public bonds with gold, then the gold public bonds can be given the special right to low-interest mortgage loans. If it is feared that they cannot be cashed at maturity, they can be issued in a cycle, using the gold income from the new public bonds to repay the old public bonds, and the gold required for the bonds can be included in the export budget or the mortgage loans of the gold public bonds can be made primarily to increase the production of export goods. As long as there is sufficient foreign exchange, there is no need to worry about the inability to repay the gold public bonds.</p>

<h3>This Period's Cost of Living Index Will Not Be Announced in Advance</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of announcing the next period's cost of living index in advance, it was reported from Guangzhou a few days ago that the Cost of Living Index Review Committee would hold a meeting yesterday morning to discuss it. However, according to Mr. Chu Yifei, the director of the Municipal Government's Statistics Department, he told reporters that no meeting was held. The mayor has not yet approved the matter of announcing the index in advance. Therefore, the last price survey for this period will still be on the 28th (Lunar New Year's Eve). The cost of living index will be announced no earlier than the 29th, which is exactly the first day of the Lunar New Year. Therefore, factories, companies, and businesses may as well pay salaries according to the previous period's index first, and then make adjustments after the next period's index is announced.</p>
<h3>Careless Switchman Causes Accident on the Beijing-Shanghai Line; Train Collision at Kunshan Station Delays Many Passenger Trains</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 22nd Dispatch] At 6:30 this morning, a special train heading from Changzhou to Nanxiang was stopped at Kunshan Station when a locomotive at the station was preparing to head over to add water. Unexpectedly, the track switch was mistakenly set, and it collided with the rear of the train. Although the damage to the carriages was slight, the damage to the track was quite severe. After active repairs, it was finally completed at 9:20 AM. All of the trains heading up the line were delayed by more than three hours.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At 4:46 AM yesterday morning, a train collision occurred at Kunshan Station, damaging four freight cars, but fortunately there were no casualties among the passengers. The reason for this was that the fifth-fourth Shanghai-Beijing third and fourth class passenger train on the Beijing-Shanghai line arrived at Kunshan Station at 4:45 AM yesterday morning, and another temporary military train numbered 1189 was already stopped at the station. The switchman was careless for a moment and caused the fifth-fourth train to also enter the main track, resulting in a collision. The last four cars of train number 1189 derailed and were damaged. Fortunately, there was no one in the cars, so there were no casualties. The Railway Bureau immediately dispatched a rescue train to lift the damaged vehicles. By 9:15 AM, the main track was cleared, so the ninth and eleventh night express trains that did not go to Nanjing were blocked and could not come to Shanghai on time. At 10:20 AM, the Kunshan railway track was repaired, and the eleventh sleeper car arrived in Shanghai close to noon, with a total delay of three hours and forty-five minutes.</p>

As for the matter of issuing an additional month's salary and allowances for January, the Municipal Government has repeatedly telegraphed the Executive Yuan for appropriation. However, with the Lunar New Year approaching, before the central government's funds have arrived, it has been decided that the Finance Bureau will temporarily prepare the funds, and it will be issued in two days, around the 26th and 27th of this month.</p>

<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Trade Union Federation; Discussing the Price of Rationed Rice; Considering the Next Period's Index; No Longer Insisting on Reduction</h3>
<p>Regarding the authorities' increase in the price of rationed rice for workers, the Trade Union Federation petitioned Mayor Wu a few days ago. At that time, the mayor stated that the price adjustment could be postponed, but the compilation of the cost of living index for the second half of this month, regarding the rice item, must be calculated at 42 yuan per dou. In this way, workers should take into consideration the rate of increase in the relevant cost of living index. Therefore, the Trade Union Federation convened a second emergency council meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss this matter. Under the chairmanship of Zhou Xuexiang, the following resolutions were made: (1) If the price of rationed rice is maintained at the original number of 42 yuan, the next period's cost of living index will be greatly affected. In order to consider the next period's cost of living index, it was decided to abandon the original opinion (that is, to still follow the adjusted price of 95 yuan per dou). (2) The government can only adjust the price of rationed rice once a month. If there are several adjustments in a month, the right to this kind of rationed rice will be absolutely abandoned, and it is hoped that the Civil Affairs Committee will allocate rice to various rice shops as much as possible this period so that workers can purchase it. (3) Since Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau has been transferred to be the Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, due to his great help to workers in the past two years, it was resolved to petition the Municipal Government to retain him. After the meeting, Chairman Zhou Xuexiang led all the standing directors to the Municipal Government to meet with the mayor and report on the above three resolutions in detail.</p>
<h3>Police Station Director and Patrol Officer of the Water Police Bureau Indicted for Dereliction of Duty and Accepting Bribes</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The case of Shan Guohua, the director of the Suzhou River Branch of the Water Police Bureau, and Wang Baoqian, a patrol officer of the Beixingjing Police Station of the same branch, being accused of suspected corruption, was prosecuted by the District Procuratorate yesterday after investigation. On June 30, 1937, a sailboat caught fire near the Sanguan Bridge on the Suzhou River. After the Suzhou River Branch learned of this, it sent police to inspect the boat and found that the boat was carrying chemicals, film, banknotes, drawing paper, nickel ingots, and other items, so it was detained, and the boat crew was summoned for investigation. Later, Wang Baoqian, influenced by human sentiments, colluded with Shan Guohua, accepted bribes, and changed the case to a small boat emitting smoke, not a fire, and imposed a fine of 20,000 yuan according to the Violation of Police Regulations Act. They then bribed Dong Zipei, the clerk handling the case, with 20 million legal tender, and bribed police officer Fang Boying with another 18 million legal tender. Someone secretly reported this to the Third Bureau of the Presidential Office, which transferred it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, which ordered the District Procuratorate to investigate.</p>

<h3>Most Parties Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude; The Commodity Market is Generally Stable; The Issuance Date of Gold Bonds is Still to be Decided</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The reaction of the Shanghai market to the president's retirement was far less intense than expected. Financial commodities fell slightly at the opening, but then immediately rebounded, and the selling price was similar to the previous day's market. Cotton yarn prices were also very stable. Grain prices, on the other hand, rose. The trading price of white japonica rice in the market was 1,640 yuan per dan, an increase of 100 yuan compared to the previous day. Soybean oil and raw oil saw mixed rises and falls, but the changes were very small.</p>
<p>Industry insiders pointed out that the main reason why prices did not fall sharply was the lack of confidence in the currency value and the ambiguity of the CCP's response. Merchants are all adopting a wait-and-see attitude and dare not engage in large-scale transactions.</p>
<p>Another report: According to the person in charge of the Financial Management Bureau, the financial industry is currently fully prepared, and the head of funds is very abundant. No unexpected events will occur within the Lunar New Year. The bureau has also been closely monitoring in conjunction with relevant agencies to prevent fluctuations in prices.</p>
<p>Another report: The regulations for the issuance of gold bonds have been announced by the Executive Yuan and are scheduled to be officially issued on the first day of next month. However, there have been changes in the central situation, and as of now, this order has not yet reached the Central Bank. Whether it will be issued as scheduled can only be decided after Liu Gongyun, the new governor of the Central Bank, has gone to the capital to ask for instructions.</p>
<h3>Cargo Owners Continue to Raise Prices; Rice Sees Slight Increase; Flour, Bran, Oil, and Grain Markets to Close for the Holiday Starting Today</h3>
<p>The rice market saw a slight increase. Because other commodity prices rose a lot the previous day, cargo owners continued to raise prices. However, because the prices reported from the producing areas were still stable, sales were still active. At the beginning, prices rose by 70-80 yuan, but in the middle of the market, due to more supply, prices were slightly weak. The closing price was 50-60 yuan higher than the previous day. The price of white japonica rice in the North Market opened at 1,720 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan. Thin indica rice and early indica rice rose by 100 yuan, and high-quality thin indica rice was 1,700 yuan. The price of white japonica rice in the South Rice Market rose by 60 yuan, and early thin indica rice rose by 50 yuan each. Although glutinous rice also rose slightly, sales were very sluggish. Yesterday, 6,327 stones of goods arrived in the two markets.</p>
<p>Flour: The market opened flat, but then, due to the rise in prices of commodities outside the industry, people's confidence strengthened, and prices also rose. However, yesterday was the last day of trading in the market before the Lunar New Year, so there were not many transactions. The opening price of Lao Che flour was 650 yuan, and then it opened at 675 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan. Bingchuan flour was 655 yuan, an increase of 33 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng increased more, rising 35-38 yuan each. Large bags of bran were 480 yuan, an increase of 26 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: The market turned weak, especially for soybeans. Because the price of Hankou car beans rose too much the previous day, it retreated to 1,100 yuan yesterday, a decrease of 100 yuan. Jiujiang winter beans fell slightly by 20-30 yuan, Dudou was stable, and there were still many sales of corn, with prices down 50-60 yuan. Selected green high-quality goods did not open, and second-quality goods were 1,050 yuan. Red sorghum was slightly increased by 30-40 yuan. Sesame and raw peanuts were both flat and weak. Yesterday's transactions were few because it was the last day of the year.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Prices rose first and then fell back, and finally saw a slight increase. In the early market, cargo owners raised prices because of the reported rise in prices outside the industry. Soybean oil opened at 7,800 yuan, but later, due to retail investors selling at high prices and factories also selling, prices fell. Soybean oil closed at 7,400 yuan, a slight increase of 100 yuan. Raw vegetable oil once reached a new price of 6,300 yuan, and closed at 5,900 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan. Jilong raw oil alone fell by 50 yuan because the original price was too high. Small car sesame oil closed at 6,600 yuan. There was a lot of supply and demand for soybean cake, and prices were stable.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Closed: As per usual practice at the end of the Lunar New Year, the food market is closed for the holiday. The markets for miscellaneous grains, flour, bran, and edible oil closed on the 22nd of this month, and the final settlement procedures will still be held on the 24th. The North and South rice markets will close on the 26th, and all grain markets are scheduled to open on February 2nd.</p>
<h3>Credit Slightly Tightens; Unofficial Interest Rates Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Credit in this city yesterday morning turned slightly tighter from easing. Unofficial interest rates in various industries rose slightly, averaging around 50 yuan. The rubber market was relatively strong and once reached over 60 fen. The sugar market was 45-50 yuan, and the cloth market was also high, once reaching 65 yuan. General borrowing was very difficult. It is heard that the reason for this is the influence of unstable news from several banks and merchants in recent days. Also, the state bank's rediscount and day-to-day interest rates remained unchanged yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Use Increased Capital in Cash</h3>
<p>To be reviewed by the local Financial Management Bureau together with the Central Bank</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the increased capital in cash of various banks, money shops, and trust companies in Shanghai, when applying to use them for legal loans and legitimate purposes after they have been deposited, the Ministry of Finance has previously approved the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau to represent the ministry and handle the review together with the Central Bank. It is now learned that when banks and money shops in other places apply to use them, the Ministry of Finance has also approved the same procedure. If there is a Financial Management Bureau, the bureau will represent the Ministry of Finance and handle it jointly with the local branch of the Central Bank. If there is no Financial Management Bureau in the area, it will be reviewed by the National Bank or the bank entrusted to verify the capital, and then reported to the Ministry for record.</p>
<h3>To Meet the Demand for Cash at Year-End; The National Bank Will Issue More 100-Yuan Notes</h3>
<p>In recent days, the shortage of cash chips in this city has reappeared, making transactions in the market very inconvenient. Regarding the rumor that the Central Bank will take this opportunity to formally issue 500-yuan notes, Mr. Chen Yanzuo, Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the bank, officially denied it yesterday morning when he met with reporters from the United Credit Reporting Agency. Chen explained the reason for the current cash panic, saying: The Lunar New Year is approaching in an instant. Because various industrial and commercial institutions issue year-end bonuses, they need a large amount of cash. Moreover, ordinary citizens also need to reserve a certain amount of cash at the end of the year, which greatly reduces the cash circulating in the market. In addition to having already allocated a large amount of cash for emergency use within the day, the National Bank also plans to issue a new type of 100-yuan note printed by the Central Printing Factory in one or two days.</p>
<h3>Small Industrial Loan Review Meeting; Rescheduled for Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Small factories are very enthusiastic about applying for temporary loans. The Central Bank Lending Committee has received the applications forwarded by various guilds, and it has successively received more than 800 applications. The first meeting of the review committee organized by the Lending Committee was specially rescheduled for tomorrow due to other meetings yesterday.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Trade Advisory Committee of the Lending Committee held a meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday to review seven export cases. Also, the Production and Export Business Loan Review Committee also held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to review loan cases, totaling more than 30 cases.</p>
<h3>Export Limit Price Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to the Export Control Committee, the export limit price for this week (24th to 29th) is the same as last week and has not changed.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Internal Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>The internal exchange rates of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be revised from the 24th as follows: Shantou, Haikou, and Zhanjiang, 350 yuan each; Changsha and Hengyang, 200 yuan each; Yuanling, 250 yuan; Wuhan, 200 yuan; Dinghai, 60 yuan; Daishan, 60 yuan; Chongqing, 150 yuan; Chengdu, 250 yuan; Qingdao, 150 yuan; other places remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Transactions Stagnant</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the approach of the Lunar New Year, the industry generally has no intention of accepting or transferring goods, and is in a state of cessation, resulting in a gradual stagnation of transactions and a calm process. In terms of price, the official price of fully measured white oil and genuine Xihong and the guild is 4,000 yuan. The remaining, such as secondary-grade Xihong and Qing oil, are also included in the normal track.</p>
<h3>Export of Edible Oil and Oil Materials</h3>
<p>Must Be Released with Notification from the Export Promotion Department</p>
<p>According to the Jianghai Customs, regarding the export of soybeans, peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, and their squeezed oil, it should be verified and released with the official letter from the Export Promotion Department of the Export Control Committee to the Customs, which was previously notified in Bulletin No. 129. Also, the export of the above edible oil and its raw materials was temporarily suspended from August 27 of last year. The temporary management measures for the export of the above edible oil and oil materials were subsequently abolished, and bulletins No. 230 and 254 were issued successively to inform everyone. It is now ordered by the President's Tax Department that after the temporary management measures for the export of edible oil and oil materials are abolished, all exports of the above edible oil and oil materials must still be verified and released with the official letter from the Export Promotion Department of the Export Control Committee and the export exchange settlement certificate.</p>
<h3>Local Customers Turned Cautious; Cotton Yarn Trend Oscillates; Rumors of Profit-Taking Prevalent in the Downstream Cloth Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is showing an oscillating trend. As the Lunar New Year approaches, most local customers have temporarily stopped ordering goods, and actual sales on the local market have also decreased. Moreover, there is a feeling that the overall situation is about to change.</p>
<p>Both buyers and sellers are worried. However, because floating capital from local areas continues to pour in, credit is easy to loosen and difficult to tighten, and people's confidence is still boosted. As a result, most yarns have stayed at their original levels without moving.</p>
<p>The opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was at a low of 76,000 yuan, then it was raised to 83,000 yuan, and closed at 81,000 yuan, which was the same as before. The price of 40-count Blue Phoenix rose slightly by 15,000 yuan, ending at 76,500 yuan. The price of 32-count Silver Moon fell slightly by 500 yuan.</p>
<p>The spot price of 21-count Shuangma rose from 59,000 yuan to 61,000 yuan, and then fell back to 58,000 yuan at noon, with no rise or fall from the previous day. The factory price was 2,500 yuan lower, at 50,000 yuan, and the arbitrage for two days was 3,000 yuan. Prices of all grades of 20-count yarn have fallen, while prices of 16-count and lower grades have seen mixed rises and falls.</p>
<p>The cloth market turned weak. Credit within the industry is still loose, but because rumors of profit-taking are prevalent in the market, people are uneasy, and holders are continuously selling off. Local colleagues are still absorbing at low prices, but sales to customers are more sluggish. As a result, prices of all cloths have fallen by about 10%.</p>
<p>The quoted price of Longtou fine cloth is around 2,200 yuan, a slight decrease compared to before. The price of Laba Tong fine cloth was shouted up from 1,830 yuan to a maximum of 1,880 yuan, but fell back to 1,850 yuan at noon, a final drop of 300 yuan. The price of B Longtou fine cloth also fell by 300 yuan. The remaining Dongbao and Santao fine cloth were about 150 yuan lower each.</p>
<p>The opening price of Sijunzi plain serge was 1,950 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,900 yuan. Near noon, the price was shouted up again to 1,980 yuan, and the closing price was 1,970 yuan, a drop of 200 yuan. The price of Jinlian Miaowu plain serge and Leifengta plain serge were both 200 yuan lower. The price of Sijunzi plain direct serge fell by 160 yuan, ending at 2,160 yuan. Prices of the remaining cloths also followed downstream.</p>
<p>China Textile Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] China Textile Construction Company continued to sell yarn yesterday on behalf of the National Bank and the American Aid Association, but only 57 pieces were sold, with a value of 2,698,000 yuan. 11 pieces of 20-count Jin Shuangma were sold at 47,000 yuan each. 19 pieces of 20-count Hongrenzhong were sold at 48,000 yuan each. 27 pieces of 20-count Jinju were sold at 47,000 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Consistently Continue to Weaken</h3>
<p>The market for rayon yesterday was weak. Spot selling increased, credit within the industry tightened, and unofficial interest rates went from high to low. The willingness to sell in the market increased, and prices of all grades weakened.</p>
<p>The opening price of 120-count Tianqiao was shouted out as 85,000 yuan for one-week bills. Later, because the price of gold fell, and yarn and cloth prices fell, people's confidence turned from high to low, and the market once weakened, with low prices between 78,000 yuan and 79,000 yuan. After a short while, most of the credit was balanced, unofficial interest rates also fell, and the surface market replenished on dips, and the weakening trend rose again. However, because the end of the year is approaching and sales to customers are not moving, there is still a lack of improvement after the rally. At the close, there was still a lot of selling, and the quoted price tended to fall again, ending at 75,000 yuan. Prices of all grades fell across the board.</p>
<p>Because the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates for raw silk is fixed, foreign sales are not moving, and the local market is weak due to the approach of the end of the year and the lack of easing of credit, and the willingness to buy is also weak. The superior grade of Lingdan continued the weakening trend of the previous day. The opening price in the morning was a low of 81,000 yuan. There were rumors that the price of gold had fallen again, and yarn, cloth, rayon, and satin all fell together. People's confidence was depressed and decadent, and the surface market was as still as water, with the shouted price falling by 3,000 yuan. Later, because credit eased, many orders that had not been discounted continued to be replenished on dips, and the trend improved slightly, but the overall trend was weak and struggling, and finally closed at 80,000 yuan, still a decrease of 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market trend for silk and satin was oscillating and tortuous. The market trend was soft first and then oscillating, with uncertain ups and downs. The opening price of Meiya quilted fabrics in the morning was 50,500 yuan. Since spot selling from the previous day, buying interest in the market turned weak, and the market fell to 49,000 yuan. Afterwards, prices of yarn, cloth, and financial markets were suppressed, and foreign floating capital flowed out repeatedly, and after buying interest turned weak, it turned strong again, and the surface market started to pull up again, and the market turned into a better situation. Near noon, because credit tightened and then eased slightly, people's confidence continued to stabilize, and various groups added without end, and prices improved, and finally closed at 54,500 yuan, but compared with the previous day, the market still saw a pull-down.</p>
<h3>Tea Market: Ostensibly Stable, Underlying Strength</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market was even quieter than before, primarily because it was the weekend and dealers were generally waiting for the Lunar New Year's opening of the "red plate" trading. This resulted in supply not yet becoming smooth, and although buyers intended to absorb, they ultimately found it difficult to do so. Sellers also hesitated, so both inflows and outflows continued to be quiet, and transactions had little real substance. However, the underlying trend remained strong. In terms of prices, due to the exhaustion of high-end goods in stock, the current market is using goods of better quality to fill the gap, so there is no significant progress. Prices are ostensibly stable, with underlying strength.</p>

<h3>Basketball League Opens: China United Triumphs in First Match, St. John's Women's Team Loses to Li Team</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The fourth annual basketball league of this city kicked off last night. Three games started at 5:30 PM. The new facilities in the City Gymnasium's basketball hall were satisfactory, and the audience numbered over two thousand. The results of the games were: (1) Women's division: Li Team 34, St. John's 32; (2) Men's Division Two Group A: Donghua 34, Storm 29; (3) Men's Division One Group A: China United 63, Hai Qing 47. Looking at the three games, the Li Team's women's team was more willing to fight than St. John's. Storm's psychological state was abnormal, and they failed to perform to their full potential, ultimately being defeated by Donghua. China United was quite surprised at the beginning of their first game, but later gradually improved. Both veteran players and newcomers showed vigorous spirit. Although Hai Qing lost, their fighting style was clear and decisive, and they should not be underestimated. The game details are as follows:</p>
<p>Li Team Defeats St. John's (Women's Division)</p>
<p>The game between St. John's and the Li Team in the women's division kicked off this year's basketball league. With an electric scoreboard, St. John's maintained an advantage. After tying three times, the Li Team suddenly took the offensive, and the battle became fiercer. The red and green jerseys of the two teams were particularly distinct. In the first quarter, each team scored six points. The second quarter continued, and the Li Team was more successful. Their forward, Miss San, with her uniform pigtails, was beaming. Soon, they led 10-7. At halftime, the score was 16-11. In the third quarter, the score was 25-20, with St. John's trailing by five points. In the final quarter, St. John's Zhu Minlin and Jingyi quickly chased, and the difference was repeatedly only one point. In the last ten seconds, St. John's missed several shots, to the audience's regret. As a result, the score was 34-32, and the Li Team won. Among the team's forwards, Yao Silian was the most agile.</p>

From then on, it was all their game. At halftime, Donghua scored 17 points, and Storm scored 11. The psychological state of the players was related to the outcome of the game. Donghua had fought on the field for a long time and "didn't take it seriously," while Storm, although young, lacked vitality, resulting in a significant gap. Donghua ultimately swept away Storm with a score of 34-29.</p>

The opponents were Tao Huier, Taylor, Dickson, Lugen, and Luo Huiler. The initial score was 4-4. Youkesen exceeded by two points. China United did not dare to underestimate the enemy, and soon tied the score again at 9-9. Yellow-haired Taylor was a fast force, difficult to defend. At 11-10, China United's Zhang Liangxiong replaced Liu Fushan, and Le Jiazhou replaced Fu Jinsheng at 13-10. Luo Huiler was also quite fierce, making the score 15-10, which surprised China United. Dark-skinned Tao Huier, about seven feet tall, dominated the basket. At 21-16, Hai Qing replaced three players. Songyuan relied on free throws to score points, and Jiazhou scored a basket, gradually approaching. He and Zhenzhong each scored a goal, reversing the score to 23-21. Zhenzhong, Songyuan, and Xiao Le scored successively. At halftime, China United led with a score of 31-24.</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Le, Wu, and Bao showed their power. The opponent's Darky and Dickson, Lugen, and others fought back. At five minutes, the score was 41-32. When China United reached 49-37, Zhenzhong, Jinsheng, and Hanting replaced the three forwards Wu, Liu, and Le. The two armies fought fiercely.

<h3>Start of the Second Round of Football: Qingbai Defeats Qunli Team by a Large Margin; One-sided Situation at 4-1</h3>
<p>The first scene of the second round of the Men's Division football league, Qingbai against Qunli, was performed in Yiyuan yesterday afternoon at 2:30, with a small audience of less than a thousand people. As a result, Qingbai won by a large margin of 4-1. Qunli passed the ball, and the attack was blocked. Qingbai's five forwards advanced. Xiao Luo in the middle passed to Liu Tiyin, who swayed the ball under his feet. Xiao Gu darted up and powerfully kicked at the ten-yard mark, and the ball went into the net in response, opening the scoring at one to zero. Qunli vowed to recover the lost ground. Lu Fangkui launched an uprising on the edge, picking towards the center. Yu Musen headed the ball, and Huang Shijie lightly stretched his arm, catching it right. Sun Huanwen's attack on the pass was also untamed. Qingbai revitalized the offensive. Xiao Luo's two shots did not score. At 28 minutes, Xue Peiran got Jin Lusheng's pass and tried the bull knife at the 20-yard mark, and it was a hit again, two to zero. After falling again, Qunli endured hardship and shared determination, united their efforts. Ruan Longsheng ran quickly along the edge, passing to the center on time. Meng Yiliang did not return to defend, and Yu Musen lightly pulled the ball at the ten-yard mark, pulling back a city. The first half ended at two to one.</p>
<p>During the second fight, Qunli's Tang Guoli replaced Sun Huanwen. Qingbai's Liu Tiyin and Xiao Gu exchanged positions, Zhang Renyi stepped down, and Qiang Yuanzhi took over. After initial contact, Chen Longquan got Yu Musen's assistance and broke into the goal, but Huang Shijie saved it. On the other side, Jin Lusheng cut in and shot fiercely, but was caught by Xi Boming. Not long after, Xiao Gu got the chance to cross, and Xi Boming rushed out. The ball went into Jin Lusheng's feet and steadily hit an empty goal. Sun Hanxing blocked the shot in the goal and turned it into a corner kick. At 13 minutes, Liu Tiyin went deep into the baseline along the edge and hooked the ball, which was headed by Lin Gui and hit the goalpost, bouncing out. Jin Lusheng came back again, and Lin Gui imitated his example, giving another head, the head blossomed, taking the lead at three to one. In an instant, Lin Gui cleverly passed Xiao Luo, who shot at the 20-yard mark, but Xi Boming was very careful and made no mistakes. At this time, Ruan Longsheng was injured and left the court for treatment. Qingbai's offensive was in full swing. Xiao Luo shot powerfully from 25 yards, with a beautiful posture, but unfortunately, it was a bit high and went over the bar. Qunli's new force Zhou Bingrong replaced Ruan Longsheng's vacancy, and Lin Shaojun moved forward. At 23 minutes, Liu Tiyin and Sun Hanxing clashed, and then resorted to force. Both were penalized by the referee. Not long before the end of the match, Qingbai still attacked continuously. Xiao Gu went deep into the enemy area and passed to the left. Xue Peiran stood out and added a foot to the net, again announcing a hit, ending the overall situation at four to one.</p>

<h3>Coin Disaster in Longshang</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Song Lin</p>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper from Lanzhou on the 18th] Since "August 19th" increased the value of silver coins, people's lives in the past six months have indeed been like a muddy river. In Gansu, silver coins first secretly prevailed, and then openly stirred up trouble. In the past half month, they have almost been in full swing, trying to overturn the river and the sea. The various disasters caused by it have stirred up groups of people from all walks of life. The lower and middle-class people are swept into the vortex of the coin disaster, and there is almost a risk of capsizing at any time.</p>
<p>The Value of a H斗 Increased a Hundredfold</p>
<p>When the coins were changed on "August 19th," the black market price of silver coins in Gansu was around 5 million legal currency in Lanzhou (only 3 million in remote counties). At that time, the official raised its value to 6 million legal currency, but it also determined its fate, forever relegated to the cold palace, and unable to see the light of day again. Not long after, it was reborn under Minister Xu Keting, and the current value of a 斛斗 is 130 yuan in gold yuan coupons, which is equivalent to 390 million legal currency. "The value has increased a hundredfold" is no longer a descriptive term for it, but a true and accurate portrayal.</p>
<p>Scalpers Start to Move and Shift Their Targets</p>
<p>Recently, this silver tide started with deposit exchange. The handling bank issued 200 exchange certificates (note: each certificate is only allowed to exchange 49 silver dollars), and actually exchanged more than 50,000 silver dollars, making outsiders "monks of Zhang Er, unable to figure out the situation." In a very short period of time, the inventory was exhausted, and the public and teachers were foolishly lining up for a day to register, but as a result, the exchange was stopped the next day, leaving this group of salaried people happy for nothing. Seeing that they could not squeeze out silver dollars from the bank, the "scalpers" shifted their targets and sought a way out in outer counties.</p>
<p>Small Denominations are Extremely Scarce, and Large Denominations are Discounted</p>
<p>Originally, small denominations were extremely scarce in outer counties. When the deposit exchange was in progress, large denominations were discounted in the market of outer counties. A five-yuan gold yuan coupon could only be used as three one-yuan coupons. You could exchange a ten-yuan coupon for six or seven yuan of one-yuan coupons. As a result, small denominations of one yuan suddenly became popular. The scalpers in Lanzhou saw that there was a profit to be made, so they immediately spat out a large number of silver coins on the spot, squeezed back small denominations, and scattered to outer counties to exchange and speculate. As the coin wind spread, the silver coin black market was as turbulent as waves. The prices of daily necessities, which had always been based on the rise and fall of silver coins, were also messed up. For a time, the streets of Lanzhou could not see the beauty of the one-yuan gold yuan coupon, and the minimum purchase was five yuan or ten yuan, otherwise the seller would refuse customers thousands of miles away by saying "there is no way to give change." Some shops simply marked prices according to silver coins.</p>
<p>Longnan Postman Endures Hunger and Cold</p>
<p>In a small county in Longnan, two small stories happened: An early-shift postman in Longxi received his salary, all in five-yuan and ten-yuan denominations. He had to transport a batch of mail to another county. The director, fearing that the large denominations he received could not be used, gave him ten yuan in one-yuan stamps, so that he could sell them as small denominations along the way. Who knew that all the postal agencies along the way did not want to buy stamps with small denominations. The postman had no choice but to endure hunger and cold and struggle to the destination.</p>
<p>Insufficient Inventory, Refusal to Exchange Small Denominations</p>
<p>Another story: The county government of a county in Longnan once sent someone with about 1,000 yuan in large denominations to a bank in the county to exchange for one-yuan denominations, but the bank declined due to insufficient inventory. The county magistrate sent the finance section chief to negotiate, but it was still unsuccessful. The county magistrate was furious, and the bank director said that the inventory of small denominations could be checked in the accounts, and the bank did not use it privately. If the county government did not understand, he would resign and leave.</p>
<p>The Central Bank Tries to Ship in to Help</p>
<p>A week ago, the Central Bank had a chartered plane that brought more than 1.4 million yuan in one-yuan denominations. The bank, considering that the value of small denominations in circulation in the market was smaller than the value of being treated as a commodity, decided to fight the "scalpers" and used the branches of the Provincial Bank and the post office to distribute 1 million in banknotes to small counties within a hundred miles around Lanzhou to avoid being chased and swallowed by scalpers and becoming a tool for silver speculation. The remaining 400,000 yuan was used by the city's commerce and the Provincial Bank to agree on a reasonable distribution method to circulate in the city, so that there would be no difficulty in finding change in the market. However, the Provincial Bank, with extremely high interest rates, was unwilling to throw out a large sum of money to exchange small denominations. In addition, there was the problem of the cost of distributing to outer counties, which had not been resolved. It seems that if the shortage of small denominations is not resolved one day, the people who are deeply trapped in the coin disaster will not be able to catch their breath. Chairman Guo, concerned about the people's hardships, has repeatedly urged the Central Bank to quickly find a way to ship in to help.</p>
<h3>Cooperating with Construction and Strengthening Production: Gansu's Cooperative Undertaking Has a "Leap Forward" Trend</h3>
<p>Gansu's cooperative undertaking is considered to be a more developed province in the country. This is due to the rich special products and underdeveloped transportation in Gansu Province. However, human factors cannot be ignored. For example, the enthusiasm of local people and the wise advocacy of Chairman Guo Jilu have made the progress of Gansu's cooperative undertaking have a "leap forward" trend.</p>
<p>The scope of work of the cooperative undertaking is divided into four items: organization, business, finance, and education. Organization, finance, and education are used as a means to develop work, and business development is used to promote construction. In terms of business, the total value of agricultural cooperative production is more than 860,000 yuan, the total value of industrial cooperative production is more than 320,000 yuan, the total value of consumer cooperation is more than 39,000 yuan, animal husbandry cooperation has more than 30,000 breeding sheep, small-scale water conservancy benefits more than 120,000 mu of farmland, and land improvement (sand paving) benefits more than 20,000 mu of farmland. The emerging sugar beet sugar industry has established 37 cooperatives and planted more than 3,000 mu of sugar beets. Cotton production cooperatives planted more than 56,000 mu, producing more than 575,000 jin of cotton. In addition, a total of 167 cooperatives for military, government, and teachers have been formed, and the total value of special product transportation and sales cooperation is more than 87,000 yuan. In terms of cooperative finance: Since July last year, the loan was stopped on August 19, which greatly affected the cooperative undertaking. The cooperatives launched a share increase movement last year, and the total amount of shares in cooperatives in the province has reached more than 7 million yuan, and the total amount of shares in each treasury has reached 310,000 yuan. In terms of cooperative education: A total of 110,000 cooperative personnel were trained last year. The current difficulties encountered by the agricultural and industrial business of the Gansu cooperative undertaking are price fluctuations and lack of funds. Cooperative cadres also feel insufficient due to the increasing expansion of the undertaking. Therefore, the Gansu Cooperative Management Office has formulated this year's work plan, which will focus on the production of agriculture and industry in terms of business. Agricultural production, such as the increased production of rice, wheat, tobacco, medicinal materials, hemp, cotton, etc., will also focus on afforestation, odd animal husbandry, small-scale water conservancy, agricultural paving sand, sugar beet sugar, etc. Industrial production will continue to promote sheep hand standardization, variety improvement, and the promotion of hemp and wool weaving. In addition, textile, leather, oil extraction, paper making, and simple chemical production will also be closely coordinated with the Northwest Wool Improvement Team, the Northwest Animal Epidemic Prevention Team, and the Gansu Chemical Plant to gradually advance. Strengthening Construction In terms of finance, this year will establish a "cooperative accounting system," implement cooperative loans, tentatively set at 70 million yuan, try to increase the cooperative funds at all levels by 200,000 yuan, increase the subscription of treasury capital by 50,000 yuan, and train cooperative personnel as much as possible. Hold short-term cooperative workshops in various counties.</p>
<p>Gansu Province is barren and the people are poor, and most materials rely on foreign countries. Therefore, to build a new Gansu, we must first strengthen the promotion of construction undertakings, such as developing transportation, expanding water conservancy, and increasing production, so as to achieve a self-sufficient state, the so-called "make the best use of the land and the best use of people."</p>
<h3>Food Shortage in Guizhou Province: Gu Zheng Lun Cables the Pacification Headquarters to Appeal</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing, 21st Dispatch] Guizhou Province Chairman Gu Zheng Lun, regarding the food shortage in Guizhou province, recently sent a long telegram to the Pacification Headquarters to appeal, stating: "Since the price controls were lifted, the price of salt has increased fifty-threefold within a hundred days. The price of salt announced by Hai Dong, the warehouse price in Guiyang, is 578.78 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and it will certainly be more than that in the outer counties. Guizhou province sells 110,000 zu (ancient monetary unit) of salt per month, which means the purchase price for one month requires more than 60 million gold yuan. At that time, the amount of gold certificates issued in Guizhou province, according to the Central Bank's report, was less than half of this amount. Even if the entire amount issued in the province is used as money, it is still not enough to buy half of the required salt. Not only will the people of Guizhou have to eat bland food, but the salt stored in the warehouses cannot be sold. If the transporters cannot sell their goods, they will not have the capital to go to the fields to buy more. Therefore, in a desperate situation, the Salt Bureau will allow the total amount of salt allocated to various counties before December of the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948) to be purchased and transported as quickly as possible within one month at the fixed price of 33.77 yuan per dan, excluding national taxes, plus interest of 60.43%. Any amounts not purchased after this period will not be re-allocated. This is only a temporary measure to maintain public morale. If the Salt Bureau sets the price, the people will not have the means to purchase and transport the salt. To solve this problem, there is no other way than to obtain loans from the National Bank. According to the Guizhou Salt Bureau's report, there are a total of 17 transporters. The amount transported in the 37th year was 815 loads and 230 (units), but to date, only 2 loads have been transported to the warehouses. The previous salt prices have never been reduced, and the slow transportation of salt is purely due to collusion between officials and merchants. We have telegraphed the central government to request a thorough resolution."</p>

<h3>Responsible Politics in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Huang Xing Tian</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou, 18th Dispatch] On the fiftieth day of Ren Xianqun's tenure as the mayor of Hangzhou, succeeding Zhou Xiangxian, he submitted a memorandum to the first municipal council meeting held during his term. The memorandum listed eight items related to the construction of Hangzhou, which are planned to be completed between January and March of the 38th year of the Republic of China (1949). If 60% of these items are not completed by the deadline, Ren Xianqun declared that he would resign in early April to apologize to the citizens. The heads of each department will also bear responsibility. This memorandum was not only stamped with the municipal government's seal but also with Mayor Ren's personal seal. Ren presented the memorandum to all municipal councilors during the council meeting as a sign of sincerity.</p>
<p>Promissory Note</p>
<p>It is common for government leaders to issue "promissory notes," whether "bounced" or not, but it is rare for Ren Xianqun to personally present a memorandum to the council as a "promissory note." According to Ren's own explanation, this is based on his consistent advocacy and practice of "responsible politics." At the beginning of his tenure, Ren told reporters that he did not want to be an official but wanted to do things. Therefore, when he took office as the mayor of Hangzhou, he did not want to be an ordinary administrative official but to handle administration with the attitude of running a business, doing something for the citizens of Hangzhou. A newspaper in Hangzhou mistakenly reported that he would handle administration with the attitude of running a business. Ren specifically explained to reporters: "I particularly value running a business because administration can be perfunctory, while running a business requires responsibility. For example, Director Hou Jiayuan of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway cannot delay building the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway; he must complete it. If he delays and fails to complete it, in other words, if he cannot take responsibility, he must leave. It is the same for me as the mayor of Hangzhou. If I cannot do things, I will get out." His words were both straightforward and firm.</p>
<p>Two Principles</p>
<p>Ren Xianqun had no specific plans when he took office. He said: "It depends on the objective conditions, but I have two major principles: that I must serve the majority of citizens and that I must grasp the key points and do things practically." Later, in his policy report to the municipal council on January 17th, he further stated: "To serve the majority of citizens, the government's policies must seek the interests of the majority of citizens, alleviate or reduce the suffering of the majority of citizens, and use surpluses to make up for deficiencies, with the goal of implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood in its policies." Therefore, he wants to ensure that farmers in the city have their own land and that empty houses in the urban area are rented out so that everyone can live and work in peace. At the same time, he will slightly restrict the interests of a small number of privileged classes so that the lives of citizens can achieve a more equal status.</p>
<p>First Two Moves</p>
<p>Therefore, after taking office, Ren Xianqun, having taken over all the anemic and almost paralyzed institutions of the municipal government, first changed the style of his predecessors, no longer welcoming dignitaries at the train station or feasting at the Louwailou Restaurant. At the same time, he slightly adjusted the organization and rectified the ranks according to actual needs. In his work, from the beginning of his tenure, he showed a hard-working, pragmatic, and decisive style. In order to lay the foundation for running the city and increase the municipal government's income, he first took aim at unscrupulous merchants, raising the business tax rate (not the tax rate itself) twenty times. This was a surprising move, and many people said: Mayor Ren's first move will probably fail, but in the end, although he offended the business tycoons, he succeeded. His surprising second move was directed at tax collectors. In Hangzhou, among the field staff of the Tax Collection Bureau, there were reportedly so-called "Four King Kongs" and "Thirteen Taibaos," which were, of course, stains on the tax administration. After receiving the report, Ren immediately summoned everyone for a lecture and set a deadline of two weeks to name the "Four King Kongs" and "Thirteen Taibaos." If the deadline was not met, all of them would be dismissed. As a result, fourteen days passed quickly, and the "King Kongs" and "Taibaos" were still nowhere to be found. Therefore, decisively, he dismissed all the field staff. From these two events, one can imagine Ren's administrative style. Although some councilors publicly said that he was "hard-headed," and some business tycoons publicly scolded him and told him to get out, it was precisely because of his decisive reorganization of tax collection and purification of officialdom that the municipal finances could have a slight foundation, no longer running a series of deficits, and the public school staff and teachers' rice rations and salaries could be paid on time, allowing construction projects to be gradually launched.</p>
<p>Eight Public Affairs Items</p>
<p>How will Ren gradually launch his construction projects? Based on the principles of serving the majority of citizens and being down-to-earth, his first promissory note consists of the following eight items:</p>
<p>(1) Based on Hangzhou's geographical environment and the needs of its citizens, to complete the design of a modern urban construction plan by the end of March as a goal for the joint efforts of the government and citizens in the future.</p>
<p>(2) To strengthen one municipal middle school, one municipal primary school, and sixteen central national schools, ensuring that the equipment, such as books and instruments, fully meets the standards stipulated by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>(3) To increase tap water usage by 8,800 households, with the installation standard prioritizing poor households and areas with the highest water consumption but lacking sufficient tap water.</p>
<p>(4) To renovate twenty-four streets and alleys, with the order of priority determined by the district offices.</p>
<p>(5) To add night soil removal vehicles to eliminate street-side night soil carriers.</p>
<p>(6) To add garbage trucks and designated garbage stations to remove accumulated waste and improve environmental sanitation.</p>
<p>(7) To design a method of using garbage to manufacture fertilizer, starting shipments by the end of March.</p>
<p>(8) To plant three million trees to conserve water and cultivate the scenery.</p>
<p>In Line with Principles</p>
<p>From this plan, it can be seen that it is in line with Ren's two major principles: serving the majority of citizens and being down-to-earth. A reporter heard several Hangzhou residents say: "Let alone renovating twenty-four streets, as long as one stinky alley like Pishi Alley is renovated, we are willing to build a merit arch for Mayor Ren." This shows how dissatisfied the citizens of Hangzhou are with the current situation of Hangzhou, especially with the substandard small streets, alleys, sewers, and water supply. During Mayor Zhou's tenure, it was said that there were only "three roads and one West Lake," neglecting the small alleys and streets within the city. Since the establishment of the water company, it has never increased the number of water users. Therefore, when Ren Xianqun took office, many people hoped that he would not be a West Lake mayor but could truly be a Hangzhou mayor. Now, Ren has finally lived up to expectations, putting the construction of Hangzhou in front of the construction of West Lake, and putting doing things in front of being an official.</p>
<p>Commendable Points</p>
<p>There are two other commendable points about Ren's responsible politics: one is that he can broadly solicit public opinion, and the other is that he can resolve issues immediately. Everyone knows that Ren likes to dance and have fun, but this is his "American style." He is completely different when he is in the office. Not only is his office like this, but he also has the longest office hours. Even if something happens in the evening, he can work until three or four in the morning to quickly resolve it. The handling of refugee students and the酝酿ed large-scale strike of 8,000 people at the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau were both resolved quickly because of his ability to act quickly, thus maintaining the stability of Hangzhou. Ren's new trick is to add a citizen reception room to the municipal government. This year, he will also hold "public opinion surveys" and "mailbox in the air" to establish extensive contact with the broad masses of citizens and adopt public opinions from them. Recently, in order to decide what kind of city Hangzhou should be built into, he also publicly solicited opinions so that he can base his decisions on the opinions of the citizens.</p>
<p>Where to Settle</p>
<p>What kind of city should Hangzhou be built into? Our newspaper has also published articles on this topic, with the main theme being to focus on culture. At this time, it seems empty to talk about such a plan, but with Ren's down-to-earth style, we sincerely hope that Ren can practically seek welfare for the citizens of Hangzhou, and also use the same spirit and effort to build Hangzhou into a spiritual home and cultural center for the people of the whole country.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The local radio station here has officially begun broadcasting and has appointed Wei Shujia as the station director and Shen Fuqiang as the deputy station director.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] In order to pursue the collection of rent from stubborn tenants, the authorities have specially established a rent collection office to accept applications from landlords for rent collection and mediation matters.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Regarding the construction of the riverside highway, a meeting was convened and decided to proceed in three phases. The first phase includes (1) the Changmei Road (urban area to Meili), (2) the Zhimei Road (Zhitang to Meili), (3) the Xushen Road (Xushi to Shenjia Market), (4) the Xugao Road (Xushi to Gaopu Estuary), and the Baixu Road (Baimao Estuary to Xuliujing Estuary). The county government will send personnel to the countryside to conduct on-site surveys and start construction immediately. After the first phase is completed, the second phase of the highway will be built in succession. It is reported that the county government has not only telegraphed the province to request the dispatch of technical personnel to the county to assist in the handling, but has also separately ordered the relevant township chiefs along the Changmei, Zhimei, and other roads to mobilize civilian workers to construct the roadbed engineering and to strictly limit the completion date in order to facilitate military transport.</p>
