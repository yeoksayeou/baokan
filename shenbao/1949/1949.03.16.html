<h3>何院長抵京發表談話　和談可望迅速進行　政府代表人選將有變更　外交方面仍貫澈「親仁善鄰」政策</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕新任行政院長何應欽，十五日下午二時三刻專車自滬抵京，夫人王文湘女士，北何縱炎及國防部參謀總長顧祝同，科長劉文錦等偕來·總統府秘書長翁文願，立法院秘書長陳克文，監察院副院長劉哲及政院各部會首長白崇禧·徐永昌·桂永清·周至柔並代表百餘人，均在下關車站歡迎。何氏着西服大衣，面現喜悅之情，夫人着黑呢大衣，下車後分別與往迎者握手寒喧，旋卽登車返門雞閘官邸。下午五時接見記者，發表談話稱：新閣將努力於適合中國情開，符合人民之意見，公正公允之和平，以奠定團結民主的中國，而長治久安。何氏並稱：與中共之和談，可望迅速進行。至和談代表是否將有所變更或增加一點，何氏答稱：因前政院所派定之代表中有堅辭不就者，如彭昭賢卽必須變更，惟尚未考慮增加。其次何氏並強調和平與當前經濟問題連貫之重要性，當時記者曾詢以在滬與財政金融界人士會晤，對拘救經濟有何對策？何氏答稱：本人對於經濟政策，猶如「一張白紙」，惟本人中未研究，但昨在滬與財政金融界人士商談數小時後，已可瞭解總有辦法，但一個政策必須有全國人民之擁護，則可有辦法。同時，經濟問題與和平乃相連貫者，能和平，人民生活始可安定，經濟因而穩定。何氏對美援問題，認為任何國家如知道我國之困苦，而予以援助時，吾人應予接受。旋何氏再答覆有關外交政策詢問稱：外交政策，仍貫澈以往之政策，為「親仁善鄰」，對軍事革新一點，答以軍事革新乃吾人目前極重要之任務，各地軍事首長均如此主張。末何氏對有關組閣各項問題，答覆如次：新閣之籌組，因事先未有準備，故名單之決定及何時公布等，均尚有待，且以行政院簡化機構案正在立院討論中，目前尚不悉各部會歸併之情形如何，俟與提擬該案之立委陳顧遠會晤後再談。何氏並稱：目前向各方找人甚為不易，因均已南北分散，在此極短之時期中，欲立卽組成，顯甚困難。關於在滬邀約顏惠慶·江庸·章士劍三氏及民·靑兩黨人士入閣之結果，何氏吿以顏·江兩氏均已決定不參加，章氏則允予考慮。民社黨之答覆，則係允由該黨開會討論後決定，靑年黨已接受入閣之意。何氏並稱：予靑年黨之閣員名額，仍為一部長。邵力子·張治中·吳鐵城三氏之入閣問題，何氏稱：在向三氏徴詢意見後，張氏已應允參加，吳氏表示可考慮，邵氏不願任閣員，但仍願為和平代表。何氏末稱：副院長一席尚未考慮，同時否認邀顧維鈞出任外長之說。何氏此一記者招待會，係在其官邸之露天為記者包圍後所舉行者，何氏態度祥和。</p>
<h3>李代總統訪何氏　政府和談方案初稿日內即移交　新閣籌組可能需時一週</h3>
<p>「本報南京十五日電」李代總統十五日下午三時一刻親赴門雞閘何院長官邸訪何，是時張治中，邵力子及吳忠信三氏均在座，李代總統當卽在其客廳中與四氏密談近兩小時，至五時始散，眾信乃為商討有關組閣各事，而室內談笑風聲達於戶外，尤似顯示新閣人選部署頗多樂觀也。晚八時許何氏赴傳厚崗晉謁李代總統，對新閣人先問題再作研討，至十一時始近觀官邸。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕何應欽新閣組成後之第一任務，卽為加緊準備和談之進行，此次行政院長更迭，已在事實上延緩和談開始日期，蓋毛澤東會對滬人民代表團表示，和談最好於三月十五日以後開始，而截至十五日止，政府之準備尚未完成也。前由孫科領導之十人小組之起草之政府和談方案初步意見，業經李代總統與張翠，白崇禧，程潛，吳忠信等要員數度研究，李代總統為表示尊事實任內閣起見，該項意見卽將轉交何應欽。孫科十人小組之任務，已吿完成，今後應如何研究，將由何應欽自行決定，和談方案亦須何閣通過，始能據以商談。至政府和談代表除張治中，邵力子兩氏仍繼續擔任外，黃紹之辭意，經李代總統拘留，已可望打銷，將來僅需另行遴補二人或三人，其人選亦將由新行政院開會決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕新閣之籌組過程，可能需時一週，何氏邀約之閣員，截至目前為止，所可探悉者，乃包括各方面人士，尤重視一向以和平為號召之權威人士，是以何氏之新閣顯為一和平之內閣，新閣副院長一席，聞曾經何氏邀請吳鐵城氏出任吳曾允於赴穗處理移交事宜後，返京從長考慮·秘書長一席，若干人士認為，以黃少谷之可能性為最大，其次如洪蘭友，張道藩，彭昭賢亦為傳說之對象。部會中最重要之財部，徐堪可能蟬聯部長，而盧懸之外交部長，則為眾所注視而不易求得解答之一員。國防部長是針由何氏兼任一點，何氏對記者表示尚未考慮。又聞立委中聞有推薦入略者為范予遂，王啟江兩氏，結果如何尚無所聞。</p>
<h3>立委致函何氏　建議愼選閣員</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕部分立委於何應欽抵京開始組閣之日，致函挖苦氏，就人事問題提函建議，該函云：「國步艱難，於今為烈，人民痛苦，火熱水深，自倡導和平以來，局勢為之一變，政治基礎全在革新，一綫生機，擊於新閣者至重且鉅。吾人同意先生之奉命組閣，一為達成和談之任務，一為澈底改革之措施，希望先生愼終於始，勿任迷信武力之頑固份子加入，致和平之門，勿使依法無能之投機份子濫竽，致塞進賢之路，已敗者何堪再試，垂死者亟望更生，水能載舟，亦能覆舟，與情向背，卽政府之寒暑表也，敢貢直言，諸維鑒察。」列名該函者有驚覺天，孔庚，榮春霖，黃建中，李峯，羅霞天，李世軍，甘家馨，張平江，苗啟平，盧郁文等卅餘人。</p>
<h3>監委糾舉孫科　密令撥款分配數行荘</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕前行政院長孫科於該院疏散時，手諭財長徐堪以秘密辦公費項目撥款一億一千萬金元一案，經監委喻培厚，倪弼等調查結果，查出此款項係撥交中國實業銀行，轉分配於若干家銀行錢荘，並已由喻。倪二委員正式提出糾舉，於十五日下午提出九人審查委會審查成立，所撥出之款，並由監院咨請李代總統飭令政院追回。</p>
<h3>白崇禧日內返漢　程潛回湘陳誠由台飛京　王陵基定今日由渝東下</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕白崇禧將於一二日內由京返漢。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十五日電〕豫主席張軫十五日午後五時乘車抵漢，候謁白總司令，有所報吿。</p>
<p>〔中央社長沙十五日電〕程潛十五日由京飛衡，改乘粵漢鐵路專車，於當晚十時半抵長。</p>
<p>〔本報台北十五日電〕陳誠偕嚴家淦及隨從等，於十五日下午二時四十分乘天雄號專機飛京。又王世杰曁夫人十五日下午五時自台中抵台北。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十五日電〕王陵基十五日偕財廳長任師尚由蓉飛抵渝，十六日與楊森同機飛京。王氏稱：此次赴京主旨在謀穩定川省經濟，並求解決鈔荒及請核準四川絲業公司四十億貸款，至和談大計，一切聽命中央。又川境力使安定，足以靖亂，關於川省兵額，今省府會議決減配額總數三分之二，川糧照常東下。</p>
<h3>立院三讀通過　簡化行政機構　修正政院組織法三五兩條條文　裁併八部一會一局</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕新任生下院長何應欽抵京正式開始組閣之日，立法院卽迅速順利三讀通過簡化生下機構案，修正行政院組織法第三條及第五條條文，以大刀闊斧之作風，裁併八部·一會·一局，幾使行政院所屬部會減少二分之一。該案之所以迅速通過，係為配合李代總統所倡導之政治革新，俾何應欽氏可按新組織法進行組織尊顏。經修正通過之行政院組織法，僅保留內政·外交·國防·財政·教育·司法行政·經濟·交通八部·蒙藏·僑務兩委會及主計一處·農林·水利·工商·資源四部會併為經濟部，糧食部改田糧署，隷屬財部·社會部裁撤，而於內部中高社會司，主管社會行政·主計部改主計處，隷屬行政院，至新閣局則予撤銷，今後行政院政務委員將僅有兼部會者十人，不兼部會者七人，連同正副院長共十九人，組成政務會議，負責全國政務之策劃與推進。立院十五日院會，上下午之時間幾均為研討該案所佔去，期間曾展開數次激辯，並經反覆討論，數度表決，始獲定論。原案係由立委陳顧遠等提出，僅修正第三條文，審查意見以涉及第五條之新聞局及擬裁改之主計處，勞工局及資源局，故連帶修正第五條條文。十五日晨開會時，程序委會建議為適應需要，該案應提前討論，主席童冠賢徴得會眾同意，卽就審查意見宣付討論，各委員紛紛發言，咸對簡化行政機構之原則表示贊成，惟何者應裁併，何者應保留，則有不同之意見，有主張保留農林部者，有主張僑委會改僑務局，隷屬外交部者，有反對裁併地政部者，有主張農林。工商併為經濟部者，某委員當提議為便於進行討論，應就審查意見逐部決定去留，經大會採納，卽開始逐部討論，應予保留之內政·外交·國防·財政·教育五部，咸無異義。討論至司法行政部時，有人主張應將司法行政部交還司法院，且不必設部，惟以格於憲法規定，該項意見旋被打銷，討論至農林，水利兩部併為農林水利部時，若干委員主張應做到確實簡化，可將農林·水利·工商·資源四部會合併為經濟部。主張保留農林部名義者，力表反對，爭辯良久，經付表決，以多數通過四部合併為經濟部。繼續討論交通及蒙藏，僑務兩委會，均無甚異議，有人主張蒙藏委會可改為內部蒙藏司，但附議人數不足，修正案未獲成立，卽均照審查意見通過。討論應予裁併之部會時，「社會部裁撤，其有關勞工業務另設勞工局直隷政院」之審查意見，竟吿通過，但於全案二讚通過後，此項決定復被某委員打銷，經再度表決，改為「社會部裁撤，關於社會行政由內政部設社會司辦理，其附屬機關一併移歸內政部管轄」。地政部改地政署，衛生部改衛生署，均隷　　內政部，僅略有討論卽吿通過。糧食部改設田糧署，隷財政部。主計部改主計處，隷屬行政院及任意球新聞避兩議，均無異議通過。某委員曾力陳資源委會不應併入經濟部之理由，惟該案業已議決，無法變理。逐部討論完畢後，有人復提出除撤銷改併之部會外，其餘各部會亦應儘量緊縮，所有組織法，須一一從速修正，當獲得多數委員之贊同，至裁去機構，其原有業務亦經決定按其性質分別劃歸有關機關辦理，一併列入決議，旋主席命宣讀修正後之文字，並徴詢會眾同意，省略三讀手續，行政院組織法第三條及五條條文之修正，遂吿完成。</p>
<p>修正後之條文如下：</p>
<p>第三條　行政院設左列各部及各委員會：</p>
<p>（一）內政部</p>
<p>（二）外交部</p>
<p>（三）國防部</p>
<p>（四）財政部</p>
<p>（五）教育部</p>
<p>（六）司法行政部</p>
<p>（七）經濟部</p>
<p>（八）交通部</p>
<p>（九）蒙藏委員會</p>
<p>（十）僑務委員會</p>
<p>各部及各委員會之組織，以法律定之。</p>
<p>第五條　行政院設主計處，其組織另以法律定之。</p>
<h3>審查停徴兵糧案　決定提廿二日院會報吿　制止交通事業漲價改為質詢案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立法院第三會第五次會議十五日舉行，晨九時三刻開會，出席一七八人，童冠賢主席，宣讀上次會議記錄後，程序委會提出數項報吿，關於黃統等所提迅速停止徴兵，徴糧案之審查，經決定由內政及地方自衛委會，國防委會及糧政委會各推委員五人，進行審查，提出廿二日院會報吿。牛踐初等所提緊急動議，制止交通事業漲價，行政院迄未執行，擬請採取有效措施案，決改為質詢案，並卽通知交通部長於十八日列案，並卽通知交通部長於十八日列席立院會議，以備質詢。關於和平意見一案，前經提由上次會議表決，因在塲人數發生疑問，特再提出重付表決，全塲一致無異議通過。繼續討論簡化行政機構，修正行政院組織法第三條條文之審查報吿，各委員發言甚多未獲結論，迄十二時散會，下午三時五十分續會，仍就簡化行政機構案發言，至五時五十分始吿竣事。最後討論行政院咨為全國各地高等特種　事法庭業經令飭撤銷，特種刑事法庭組織條例，特種刑事法庭審判條例及戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例應卽庚正，請查照審議案，決議應予撤銷，其他各案以時間不及，留待下次會討論，至六時散會。</p>
<h3>整軍計劃提案　列下次會議程</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立院程序委會十五下午六時開會，討論下次院會議事日程，除十五日院會未經討論各案移入下次大會議程外王廣慶等提，擬請政府速訂整軍計劃，減少軍額，緊縮開支，核實發餉，並將非戰鬥人員儘量裁減，節省公　案，亦予列入。</p>
<h3>立監委座談會　定廿日晨舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立。監兩院委員交換當前時局意見之聯席座談會，定廿日晨九時在國民大會舉行。此事為立委之建議，業經監委同意。</p>
<h3>美總統注視　我局勢演變</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十四日電〕白宮及國務院對何應欽將軍之受命組閣，仍保持緘默。國會中支持援華主張美國採取更積極之對華政策之呼聲日高，惟關於中國問題之正式討論，尚待開始。至於自四月三日至六月三十一日止之臨時援華計劃，不久卽批準。白宮方面人士謂：杜魯門總統正密切注意中國局勢之演變，而對南京方面之政局，甚為關懷，渠顯經常獲得關於中國之機密報吿，而由渠所領導之國家安全委員會加以研究，但迄今猶未採取任何決定。美國政策擬定所最關切者，仍為國共和談之結果，一般承認，中國危機對美實為一極重要問題。</p>
<h3>監院秘密檢討會房室　加強行使監察權　咨請立院修正有關彈劾案條文　配合輿論制裁貪官污吏</h3>

<h3>社論　挽救經濟危機</h3>
<p>—對何院長希望之三—</p>
<p>本市三月份上半月的職工生活指數，昨已由市府當局發表，為「八一九」的一三三九·三六倍·這在工厰方面，如何籌措鉅額現鈔，發放三月份上半月的職工薪金，又成了一個嚴重難關了。我們看到今日許多工厰在高利息政策及其他重重困難盤剝煎熬之下、早已陷於「求存不得求關不能一」的窘境，現在更受到高生活指數的威脅，當局如果再漠視其後果，吾恐一二月之後，上海所有工厰，十之七八都要宣告停業破產了吧！工厰如一旦大　關門，失業陡增，此種經濟危機，實在不容我們忽視。上海如此，其他各地當亦同愛影響。</p>
<p>何院長在昨天進京以前，一再邀集本市金融鉅子會商，目表示新閣難題最感棘手者，和談而外，即為財政經濟問題。我們當然也最盼望何院長的新閣能有挽救經濟危機的良策。</p>
<p>原來我們的經濟危機不自今天始。抗戰後期種其因，而為患尚不大。勝利以後，採用拋售黃金和官價結匯的政策，欲恃此以穩定知時期內的物價，但國庫所存九億美金的資產，也因此浪費殆盡。到了外匯改採機動牌價而後，物價與外匯就循環上跳，有如脫疆之馬。再經過翁內閣王雲五財長改革幣制之冒失政策，囊括中產以下人民儲藏之金銀外幣而悉入於國庫，「財聚則民散」，大局乃如江河之日下。歷來財經政策最大的缺點，就在於始終沒有打好主意切實使真正有錢者儘量出錢，迨最近孫內閣徐堪財長所主持的財政金融改革方案，出而問世，會對現實，有所改革，固然與王財長的措施不可同日而語，但依然缺少了最重要的一環，即是：沒有使豪富受着絲毫影響。因之，雷厲風行的結果，或許反而使一般普通工商業和平民生計感受到　外的扼殺。</p>
<p>姑先就最近生活指數說起。二月上半月較一月下下半月漲上近八倍，二月下半月則較上半月漲上近一倍，三月上半月則更較二月下半月又漲過一倍了。除了二月上半月因廢曆年關後春節紅盤的特殊關係，猛跳七八倍外，餘幾每半個月漲高一倍。假定此速度不變，則第個月的生活指數就合到上月份的四倍。物價安得而不步漲？何況薪工而外，工商業者尚須負擔過高的利息。上週市場的平均利率，日拆要到六七角，貸款者八九天之後就要負擔對本的利息。假使拿這種高利速度來計算成本，一個月的物價可以狂漲七八倍。這除了豪富可以更加錦上添花而外，將使一般工商企業家和小本經營者，何以維持其事業？而徒恃薪工謀生的一般公教人員和平民，其憔悴呻吟，更無恃論了！</p>
<p>現當局所想用以穩定物價之策，無分抽緊銀根。然而中央銀行運用拋售金銀與外匯證的手段，抽緊銀根之後，金價固盤旋於三百萬與三百五十萬元之間，使一味哄抬金價的投機份子受到相當打擊，但這究竟能抑平多少物價，還是問題。平心而論這種拋售政策，從好的方面看，值得稱道的，有下列幾點：（一）央行先以高價拋售金銀外匯，再適低價補進，在央行方面不僅不受損失，反而有利可圖。政府在投機市場上可稱為無敵大戶，無住而不利。（二）過去物價漲風，都由金融性商品領導上漲的，現在擒賊擒王，把金融性商品價格穩定了，別種物價當不會日漲夜大。（三）上海市場本來就是一個投機市場，被少數大戶所操縱，這些大戶不啻是人民的吸血鬼，政府應該予以打擊，使他們不得不屈服。但在另一方面看，卻也有許多嚴重問題：（一）這種政策是可恃而不可久恃的，抑且也決不能阻止物價上漲，充其量不過使物價作有秩序的上漲，而半個月漲上一倍幾乎成了定律。（二）這種政策雖然打擊了投機份子，但也苦了正當的工商業。由此而連帶產生的高利息政策，可使貨物的成本半個月高上兩倍，實足以虐殺正當的工商業。各工厰如果貶價斬　成品，銷路又很清淡，即使賣出去了，所得不足以再生產。如此情形，最後只好都走上「關門大吉」之路。（三）如果半個月祗漲一倍，則端午節左右的米價豈非將漲到每石一百念萬元？況且將來一日央行不能控制市場時，漲風更要狂奔亂跳，一發不可收拾，而小民愈感無以為生！</p>
<p>由上所論，可知新內閣當前最急切的問題，誠是如何挽救經濟危機，以減除人民生活的威脅。而孫內閣的改革方案還是不夠的。須知和談固然重要，但假使政府轄區內的人民，大家到了為高物價高利息高工資所壓迫而不能生活下去的時候，政府還會有資格有力量來談對等的和平嗎？和談必須有本錢，惟有人民生活穩定的情緒，愛戴政府的心理，纔是政府從事和談的資本。然則怎樣可以挽救經濟危機呢？這當然需要若干專家的研究，而最須努力爭取實現的，不外乎使豪富出錢。取之於豪富，用之於平民，自可收拾人心，一新耳目；因為惟有這樣，纔合於「財散則民聚」的金科玉律。千言萬語，政府一切經濟計劃，一切財經改革方案，假使今天還不肯認清現實，針對這個病根下藥，那是徒勞而無益的。</p>

<h3>台省計劃試驗　英式社會主義制度</h3>
<p>〔本報台北十五日電〕台灣於光復以後之三年來中，曾經過日本式及美國式行政制度之試驗，自陳誠主持台省省政以來，又擬將該省作為試行英國式社會主義制度之場所。陳氏刻正計劃將英國現行的全面配給制施之於台灣，已羅緻留英歸來學者多名，為台灣省府擘畫此事。陳氏本人對於英國之社會主義極為欽羡，且曾著有關於社會主義的書籍。陳氏在台社會主義施政之成敗，有賴於渠之能否使台省直接經營對外貿易，目前各省對外貿易歸中央當局代辦，台灣所得者非為外匯而為金圓劵。此外，當地居民之能否與陳氏合作，亦為試驗社會主義制度得獲成功之主因。台灣受日本統治垂五十年，光復以後，中國當局將台省物資支援國內之戰事，陳儀接事之初，接收台省各主要工業及專賣企業，并以外省人主持各機構，殊引起台灣人之不滿；魏　明視事以後，實施美國制度，聯絡台省的聲望人士，以之作為政府與台人間之中間人，然此等台灣富戶與民間亦少接觸，反利用與魏氏之關係遂其一已之私利，至今年一月，由於國內局勢之劇變，遂由中央中央另任陳誠為台省主席，陳氏推行社會主義之成效如何，尚有待於事實之證明。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十四日電〕據接近英外交部各方面聲稱：外傳關於太平洋公約之談話業已開始，此說傳之確屬過早。據英國半官方面意見，必俟大西洋公約已告完成，而後乃能開談太平洋公約，接近英外長貝文之各方面，現日益明瞭，今急宜組織遠東民主的強國，并注意彼等之政策，以配合西方列強關心保持世界該部分和平之政策，今尚需時日，以已籌定之方法應付此諸國之任何發展。</p>

<h3>蘇最高座談會閉幕　政府內部人員續有更動　國家設計會主委免職值得重視</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十四日電〕最高蘇維埃座談會今夜通過本年度總預算，規定國防經費七百九十億盧布，旋即宣告閉幕。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十四日電〕蘇政府要員三人今日經最高蘇維埃下令免職，一為國家設計委會主席兼副總理伏茲尼森斯基，遺缺委由另一副總理蕯布洛夫繼任。又最高法院院長戈爾亞柯夫亦經免職，由伏林氏繼任。又最高蘇維埃主席團團員之一鮑波柯夫免職後，令派密海洛維契繼任。</p>
<p>按伏茲尼森斯基係於戰前蘇聯被告清黨後始露頭角，一九三四年任職列寗格勒設計委員會時，或為蘇共黨要人日丹諾夫之親信。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十四日電〕此次蘇聯內閣人員調動原因雖未說明，顯屬政府統盤改組計劃之一部份。此外，最高蘇維埃主席團并宣布裁併建設，陸海軍企業。及機器工業三部為建設機器工業部，由原任建設部長臺加耶為部長。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕此間觀察家認為蘇聯國家設計委會主席伏茲尼森斯基之免職，或係表示蘇聯領袖已在重新考慮蘇聯外交政策的主義基礎。此項揣測是否正確，可由伏氏是否仍保留共黨政治局委員之職務而獲定論。此間觀察家并指出，莫洛托夫及米高揚於月初分別被免外長及國外貿易部長職時，仍保留其副總理之職位，而伏茲尼森斯基則不然，連副總理職位亦被解除，惟渠之政治局委員職或可望保留。果爾則渠之被解除副總理及設計委會主委職，或為將專心致力於東歐經濟互助委會工作之意。一說伏氏之被免國家設計委會主席職，乃蘇聯領袖對於其與西方國家關係主義上的基礎信仰已有動搖之故。過去一年來，自蘇聯名經濟家伐爾迦發表新論，認為西方國家可能經由改革而非經由革命方法，以完成社會經濟解放後，頗引起蘇聯領袖之爭論。伏茲尼森斯基即為反對伐爾迦論見最力之一人，故此番伏氏之被免職，或係表示蘇聯領袖，對於其外交政策所基之主義，已開始予以再檢討。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本期生活指數昨日延至十二時三刻，始由市政府發表，較通常延遲二小時餘，且發表之指數一三三九倍，較一般人預料為低，因此引起各界懷疑，種種流言亦隨之而起，於十一時許并一度盛傳指數業已決定為一六四二倍，若干工廠行號，一時不察，竟有即依一六四二倍發薪者。記者為明瞭其中真相，分訪各有關人士，探詢指數審議會中情形及「一六四二」傳說之來源。據悉：昨日會議於十時半開始，首由市府統計長褚一飛報告環比與固定指數編算結果，舊指數為一三三六倍，而市總工會新編算者為一三三九倍（亦係市府編製公式），兩者相差不多，總工會理事長周學湘則以目前物價每日有秩序上漲，半月中上漲何止一倍，薪工階級以此半個月中之平均物價，應付當前現實生活，實不可能，乃提出建議二項：（一）現行指數編製之調查物價共五次，第一次係在一日，其時物價與上期指數中最後一次物價相差無幾，若加入計算後，對指數影響實極大，應予取消，而單以其後四次平均計算。（二）指數中米價，應全以市價計算（按現行編製係一半市價，一半配價）。但此二點建議立刻遭到工業界代表之反對，引起雙方熱烈爭辯，市府雖頗依一三三九倍，總工會代表仍拒絕簽字，僵持甚久。因若周學湘氏之二點提議能被採納，則本期指數當在一千五百倍以上，與昨所發表者相差二百多倍。後經市社會局曹局長一再解釋，并允下期指數編製方法可從長計議，力勸總工會代表簽字，此「一三三九」指數始告誕生。外傳「一六四二」，即係總工會所提出之指數，而總工會方面則力加否認，但謂：「亦聞此說，惟不知從何而來」。</p>

<h3>喬遷金屋同事歡宴　一宿醒來佩槍失蹝　飛綸製綫廠副經理　服藥中毒案情離奇　其妾稱係自殺涉嫌扣押</h3>

<h3>二十年前名噪全滬　而今住食都成問題　王漢倫仰屋興嗟</h3>
<p>與周祥生發生房屋糾紛　呈吳市長請求予以救濟</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕廿年前曾以「小寡婦」之名眩耀影壇之悲劇明星王漢倫，近以其所居遭房東周祥生勒遷，因無力他移，乃自行繕呈吳市長請求救濟，經市府轉交地政局於日前傳訊兩造，未有結果，現定十九日再度傳集雙方進行調解。</p>
<p>王之居處在林森中路九一八弄十九號，原係周祥生所經營之祥生公寓，去年起周以亟欲收回該屋交與其王姓妾居住，乃有遷之舉。王所居僅為一亭子間，寬不及丈，室內更凌亂異常，據渠稱，居此已六年，六年中在滬江美容院為人美容，藉謀糊口，與電影界早已隔絕。此一垂垂老去之紅星，與人談及往事，常不勝唏噓，自謂前塵如夢，真覺不堪回首。</p>
<p>王入影界遠在民國十六年前，以「孤兒救祖記」一片名噪全滬，因渠所主演之各種悲劇性影片，如「玉梨魂」，「春閨夢裏人」等，在南洋銷路奇佳，當時規模最大之明星公司曾倚為臺柱。嗣嫁杭州名士王季歡，以性情不合，同居一百日即告仳離。抗戰前渠曾自費設漢倫影片公司，攝成有聲影片「盲目的愛情」，「紅花瓶」二部，迨上海淪陷，敵寇脅渠在偽「大中華廣播電臺」担任宣傳，王婉拒之，繼即正式脫離銀幕生涯，隱名蟄居。數年來渠以積蓄化費殆盡，美容工作又所入無幾，故常三餐不繼，在生活掙扎中顯見憔悴不堪。</p>
<p>渠對此次房屋糾紛，表示不欲乞助於電影界或任何境遇較佳之後輩明星，因渠自覺近年來已備受渠等之冷淡與遺忘。渠謂包天笑過去與其合作甚久，最近擬請包代編一劇本，出演話劇，但渠又担心世態炎涼，人老珠黃，恐將難獲觀眾歡迎。</p>

<h3>北平型　（四）</h3>
<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>（關於「局部和平」前後的一個城市的報這）</p>
<p>毛澤東在「論聯合政府」一文中，曾指明中國目前的革命運動，還是在新民主主綫的階段，由新民主主義的階段轉入社會主義的階段，才能實行共產主義。聯合政府是實行新民主主義的政治形態，暫時的過渡性政府，一旦進入社會主義的階段，便將是無產階段專政的政治形態。毛澤東為適應中國國情，將共產主義革命的發展，修正為新民主主義和社會主義兩個階段。新民主主義的內容，便是三民主義的眞實執行，大同而小異。現在共黨在城市裏所採用的政治路綫，當然還是一種在共黨領導下的聯合政府形式，比較能在各方面取得好的反應。</p>
<p>另外還有一個問題，便是中共和蘇聯的關係。長瀋撤守後，住在北平的東北人士，經常由東北帶來了關於蘇聯軍隊進入東北後的許多情形，如蘇聯軍隊强姦婦女，使瀋腸有十六歲以上大姑娘在家的人民，都設法趕快物色一個對象，草率地嫁出去，以免發生問題。許多共軍幹部的家眷也被强姦，引起了反感。甚至女的蘇聯軍人也强姦男人，實在她們的身體太好了！有一個被俘的國軍士兵，在哈爾濱受訓的時候，他與共軍的指導員辯論一個問題，他（國軍士兵）說：「你們說美國是帝國主義，我們應該打倒它，我很同意。但是美國是帝國主義，他無代價的送許多救濟物資給我們救濟人民。蘇聯是我們的友邦，他却將我們東北的許多物資和機器，都搬到蘇聯去了。這是怎麼樣解釋呢』？那位指導員無法答覆，便說：『你說的很對，我不能答覆這個問題，待我去請一位上級的指導員來答覆你』。後來那位上級的指導員來了，也沒有答覆這個問題，他只說：『現在我們大家吃飯吧，不討論問題了」。</p>
<p>在這一次北平和談的當中，筆者有一位朋友，曾代表某方面到城外與共軍接過頭，他除了談判本身的任務外，還與葉劍英下面的一位政委，談論了許多理論方面的問題。那位朋友問到中共與蘇聯的關係究竟是怎樣的？那位同志的答覆很巧妙！他說：『中共是完全以毛主席為中心。毛主席是一位以中國為本位的人，一切政稱政策的決定和修正，都以適合中國國情為主，譬如新民主主義便是根據中國國情提出來的。至於毛主席與蘇聯是怎樣一種關係，我們是不去過問的』。依然是沒有得到答覆。</p>
<p>雖然進攻平津的解放軍中，也有蘇聯顧問在指揮作戰，但是中共與蘇聯的關係如何？筆者在這兒是無法加以具體說明的·</p>
<p>（四）和平後的北平新聞界</p>
<p>北平過去的新聞界，共有大小報紙二十多家，除了很少數是公營的外，多數都是私營的。因為人民購買力弱，銷數不多，許多報紙除了靠配給紙張的變相補貼，是很難自拾自足的。北平被圍以後，人民都需要知道戰事的發展，人手一報，報紙銷路大增，賣報的販子，也成了一種時興的職業。局部和平實現以後，因為協議中已經規定原有報紙照常出版，以後再申請審查登記，所以連反共最力的黨報——華北日報，也照常出版，沒有停刊，只是社長早已溜到南京去了。</p>
<p>共軍進城以後，他們最注意的是宣傳工作，首先便接收了華北日報改為人民日報，北平廣播電台改為新華電合，中央通訊社改為新華社。開始担任了他們黨所付予的宣傳任務。</p>
<p>人民日報是接收後經過一天的籌備，便開始出刊了·對開一大張，每張定價人民劵二元，內容完全以黨報的姿態出現，長篇大論的宣傳文字，載滿了篇幅，新華社的廣播材料，也全部刊登。一個專電總在千字以上，普通的新聞和消息却很少·他們對於編排和文字的寫作，都是另外一種作風，與原有北平的報紙，大不相同。其特點有下列數項：</p>
<p>（一）普通報紙是晚問編輯，平上六時以前出版；而人民日報是平上編輯，中午一二時出版。</p>
<p>（二）普通報紙注重消息報導和社會新聞；而人民日報則反之，甚至一條社會新聞也沒有。</p>
<p>（三）普通報紙注重廣吿和經濟行情的刊載，而人民日報則原來全不刊登廣吿和經濟行情，後以事實上的需要，才酌量刊登了幾欄廣吿和經濟新聞。</p>
<p>（四）普通報紙多銷於北平城內，及幾條鐵路的幹綫上；而人民日報除以一部銷售於北平，多數都是寄送解放區的各級政府工作人員，及武裝部隊閱讀，作為宣傳品。</p>
<p>（五）原來北平的報紙定價，四開者為金圓三十元，入開者為二十元；而人民日報對開一張僅售人民劵二元，合金圓劵二十元。價格較之特低會有同業向之提出，請其提高價格，而彼則以此係黨的決定，不能任意更改，不受問業協覆之限制。</p>
<p>人民日報的員工，除編輯採訪兩部的人員，一人未留外，其餘發行，經理·及印刷工人都是一律留用。人民日報目前的印刷數量為六七萬份，較華北日報多二倍至三倍。</p>
<p>除了人民日報是中共的黨報外，其餘民營的報紙，為避免控制與論的罪名，採取了自生自滅政策·一則封鎖新聞來源，使你無法採到一條消息，黃色的社會新聞也不好刊登。新華社的通訊稿只供給已經審查登記的報館，沒有經過審查登記的報社，因無通訊稿便發生了新聞來源的困難。再則你卽使自己收鐵新華社的廣播電，也是千篇一律，大同小異，人民花同校的代價，當然顯意買一張對開紙，不順買一張八開祇。而兌人民日報刋有人民臻　的文告，必需一看。因之過去銷達數萬份的報紙，都慘落到一二千份，甚至幾百份者亦有之。銷路銳減，收入毫無，當然無法雜持，只有自行停刋了。北平民營報紙多因此停刋。</p>
<p>但是另一方面，民營報紙如世界日報的銷路，反而增加了。這有幾種原因：一是該報有一部分南京廣州的專電，大家在普訊隔絕後，很希望知道一些南方的消息。二是其他的民營報紙停刊後，當然讓出了一部份讀者給世界日報。三是世界日報的歷史較久，北平人民對他的印象也比較深。銷路增多，擁有廣大的讀者，固然是世界日報的喜事；但同時亦是招致中共的嫉妬懷恨，而後來在CC派的罪名下查封的主因。中共佔領區內是不願意報導不利他們的眞實消息，也不願意有一個第三者立塲，銷數廣大的報紙在他們的區城內存在，因為這對他們是一個莫大的精神威脅力量！世界日報是一個民營報紙，銷數又比較廣大，他們當然不願其存在，可是不得不找出一個冠冕堂皇的罪名來，否則與他們自己所宣傳的政策相抵觸了，因此便以CC系的罪名加在成舍我身上，其實這是大大的寃枉！過去世界日報便對中共採取了一種賣好的態度，留有餘地。他們的標題，對於中共始終是稱為「殘共」，沒有標過「共匪」的字眼。對於政府許多措施的批評，是非常尖銳，而大不滿於貪汚政治。在當時的政治環境下，這已經算是大為不易了！至於中共所列舉的許多小節，那是在當時的大環境中不可避免的小現象，並不足證明成舍我是CC系的身份·北平和平以後，世界日報的言論更是向人民日報看齊，非常賣力氣！眞是欲加之罪，何患無詞！世界日報的被查封，是說明了中共不允許有眞正的言論自由，自己將民主的假面具揭穿了。</p>
<p>中共對北平的民營報紙，除了自生自滅政策以外，其餘就是放任或暗中慫恿報社員工向社方淸算和鬥爭，使之自相殘害，共趨滅亡。各報社內差不多都發生了大同小異的淸算事件，宣稱社方過去曾對他們剝削了，必須予以彌補。卽使是按月虧賠的報紙，也不能例外。新民報因內部傾向中共的分子較多，所以在另一種方式下，宣布獨立，與總社脫離關係，並迫令原經理敵職。在中共的控制下，由員工聯合經營，以陪襯中共保障言論的自由。</p>
<p>北平的新聞界在局部和平實現後，各報內容因環境的變換，本來就小心翼翼，希望保留申請登記的餘地，一致向人民日報看齊，千篇一律的新華社廣播消息，沒有新聞價值和閱讀的必要了！可是世界日晚報依舊被查封，新民報又宣吿獨立，其他許多民營報紙相繼停刊，目前是人民日報獨霸一方，蕭條萬狀了！</p>
<p>季昂和穆薩先後發了幾次電郝，引起中共的不滿。於是便直截了當的根據軍事管制的意義，由北平市軍事管制委員會，通知了所有駐在北平的外國記者和通訊社，一律停止活動。眞實的報導在中共區域內是不需要的！不僅新聞報導不能自由，而且由外面派去的人員，都是在保護監視之下，極力避免與社會而的接觸，使之無法了解事實眞象。而神話式的傳奇，便在上海報紙上發現了。中共究竟是非常現實的，他為着鞏固統治，對於虛偽的民主面具，隨時可以在種種解釋之下，將之拋棄，並不如國民黨的官僚作風，左右顧忌。</p>
<p>中共所標榜的民主作風和言論自由，在國民黨區域內是極力爭取的。但在中共佔領區內却不甚適用，由解放後北平新聞界所表現的現象，可以獲得充分的證明。可是話又說回來，北平究竟是實現局部和平，一切措施似乎比較開明進步些，除了人民日報外，尙可容許一二家中共所控制的民營報紙存在。而天津便只有一家天律日報，濟南只有一家新民主報了。（未完）</p>
<h3>軍官結夥搶刼　保安團長流亡抵錫　南京犯案車內落綱</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫十四日訊〕徐州人丁積支，係某保安團團長，於國共兩軍在徐州會戰時，渠所率領之保安團，亦被共軍打垮，徐本人卽率領貼身心腹數名，携帶短槍數支，突圍後出亡來錫，住居本邑鄕下中橋鎮廿五保三甲四戶，數月以來，最近因物價高漲，生活日趨困難，卽與同伴合做搶刦生涯，惟搶刦之目標為本邑蹸近等縣，搶刦方式，是早晨乘車到外埠去做了案子後，晚車卽返錫，故雖做過多次，從未破案，詎於最近在京因事機不密而被捕。</p>

<h3>滬漢匯粵匯款及運現　財部再行規定限額　每日匯出不得超過二千萬　運現赴粵每人只許二十萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於滬漢匯款及運現限額，上海金管局遵奉財政部電令，重予規定如次：自滬漢兩地匯款至粵，每日匯出總數，不得超過二千萬元，每筆不得超過二十萬元。廣州各行莊每日解付匯入匯款總額，不香超過六千萬元。又各地携運現鈔赴粵，每人不得超過二十萬元，逾限送交中央銀行存滿三個月後發還。至公務機關及工商事業機關因正常用途，必須匯出逾額款項，或携帶逾額現鈔者，應提出證明，送請當地金管局核準，發給證明書，憑證交匯或携帶，不受上項規則限制。無金管局之地方，向當地或附近地區中央銀行申請。滬金管局奉令後，業經轉飭本市銀，錢，信託，保險同業公會知照，并轉行遵照。</p>
<p>又江海關於昨亦有同樣規定之公告揭　，已於昨日起開始實行。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕近來資金南流之現象，又呈猖獗。在最近四日中，流往廣州之金配券，據銀錢業方面估計，達廿五億之多。因此廣州目前現鈔甚多，而上海方面中央銀行雖近來每日有發出大量之「一百元」及「五百元」票面之新鈔，但行莊方面，鈔荒情形仍極嚴重，即因此故。此項南流之資金，大部份均為現款，而係由單帮客及南下旅客携往者。</p>
<h3>黃金現貨交易辦法草案　金業公會業已擬妥　一俟財部核定即可公布施行　復業準備刻正在加速進行中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金商業同業公會，對黃金現貨交易辦法之草案，業經擬妥，由該業領袖徐輔蓀於日前新送徐財長鑒核。聞該項辦法，一經財部核定，即可公布施行。據徐氏昨語記者，該業之復業準備，刻正加速進行中。諸如會員復業家數，刻尚在申請登記階段。此緣該業停業已久，即須復業，各會員勢須另籌資金股東，當非一蹴而就。加以公會地點，將來如欲利用作集中交易場所，亦須經過一番部署，即以裝置一百具電話而言，此事亦斷非短時期內所可完成。凡此皆足以解釋何以該業遲遲不能復業之故。此次復業，係指該會會員同業復業，故根本無經紀人之名義，自更無所謂收取保證金之說。至會員之入會費，尚須視登記復業家數之多寡方能決定。而該會會員，向多為合夥組織，一向憑藉信用從事營業，而公會亦向以服務同業為素志，當無收取鉅額入會費之規定。</p>
<p>又譔公會昨下午再召開理監事會議，出席理監事十餘人，仍由該會代理理事長趙仲英主席。席間對會員復業登記情形，場地·電話·及各項交易設備之佈置，均作週密之討論，決加速推進準備，以便於短期內使復業實現。</p>
<p>該公會會員申請復業者，則已逾八十張。至將來究有若干家復業，該業各領袖認為在目前之環境下，實無法臆測云。</p>
<h3>央行明拋暗吸　黃金市勢回高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕黃金市勢高開高收，中間突起回風，走勢曲折。多頭疲中斬殺，多數套牢，空頭在高開高收環境下，亦未盡佔優勢。晨初承隔夜銀根趨鬆影響，人心見昂，業內拆息低，八五元有供，高九五元有求，頭寸寬緊不一，做價亦極紊亂。晨開三四〇，三四五。開後聞央行配售銀樓原金配價提高，人心轉堅，大勢看好，檯面吸意尚濃，市勢一度盤高，見三四七，三五〇。高後大戶懼有反變，逢高傾吐，市稍回低。但因指數發表，人心較堅，散多頻有扒吸，始盤於三四〇左右，未見疲色。惟因連遭打擊，心理頗虛，更因新空活躍，故檯面仍吐多納少，次盤於三三五左右。迨十一時許，央行頻施威力，市況頓疲，低至三二五三三〇。最後跌進三二邊。市勢疲憊不堪，交易呆滯。嗣後傳聞央行低後吸收，於是人心重振，檯面再起回漲，多頭吸納，新空急補，價見上升，由三二五而直跳至三三五，終至三五邊，最後以三四五三五二午收。午後銀根更鬆，拆息低至五角五。散多乘廉思進，人心頗堅，故先以高價喊開為三八五，三九〇，高後逐步軟化，先盤於三八〇左右。三時後又低盤於三七五左右。四時後又見回升，終盤於三八〇左右，嗣後以三七八，三八〇晚收。</p>
<p>美鈔漲跌情勢，隨黃金進退。晟開六八〇〇元，六九〇〇元，低見六四〇〇元，門四五〇元，午收七〇〇〇元，七〇五〇元，午後開七七〇〇元，七八〇〇元，低見七五〇〇元，七五五〇元，晚收為七五五〇，七六〇〇元。</p>
<p>國行配售銀樓業原金價格，現經金銀平準委員會議決，每市兩改為三十四萬五千元，較前日又升一萬元。</p>
<h3>港匯再縮</h3>
<p>港匯昨日晨開每千元六角六分，前晚收為七角一分半。金圓券昨晨開每千元一元二角半，關晚收同價。港金每兩昨晨開三〇四元，關晚收三〇四元二角五分。美金電匯昨晨開五元二角一分，前晚收五元一角九分。美金期票昨晨開五元一角九分，前收五元一角八分。美鈔昨晨開五元一角六分，前晚收同價。</p>
<h3>銀根昨已轉鬆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根，走勢自平趨鬆。初開日拆尚屹立於九十元到一百元之光景，旋以行局隔日差入不鉅，業內多單紛紛外供，而國庫市庫約有二十五億元之支撥，外埠匯款約有四十億元之數外流，內臺匯已佔半數。銀根鬆勢頻添實力。而週一以來，國行拋紗無形停止，黃金亦屬虛張聲勢，收歉市場銀根之力頓去，故日拆頻瀉，至七八十元仍供應不絕最後做低至六十元光景。同業頭寸供應充沛。緊張逾週之銀根，已見靈活之轉機。</p>
<p>昨日現樂緊勢，以國行對同業仍執行限制，而月中各業發薪，需要增加，故緊勢有增無減。外界盛傳國行當局已乘機將千元券出籠，惟據國行某機要人員請記者，并非事實。螯目前五百元券已敷週轉，故千元券在本市尚未發出。</p>
<p>國家行局庫昨日結果差出五億二千餘萬元，洋商各行差出十億三千餘萬元，大交換各行差入九億三千餘萬元，小交換各行差入六億一千餘萬元。</p>
<h3>銀錢業聯準會　日內清理結束</h3>
<p>本市銀錢業聯合準備委員會將於日內宣告清理結束。據該會負責人稱，聯準會在成立之初，其目的係銀錢業行莊求同舟共濟，在資金週轉不靈時，可互相扶助。惟目前本市銀錢業行莊之資金，均極薄弱。在戰前每一家銀行可週轉數家工廠之資金，而在目前則相反，每一家工廠之存款，可控制數家銀行錢莊。此足可證明銀錢業在今日之危機日重，銀錢業聯準會在此情形下，無法發生作用，已無存在之必要，故決定宣告結束云。</p>
<h3>市場散步　看客臺</h3>
<p>要顯神通應在今明　英美間金鈔鬥法已成尾聲美國勝</p>
<p>據某權威機關的統計，昨天物價指數對八一九漲為一八七三倍，等於月初的生活費指數六四三倍，約增三倍。昨晚公佈的本期指數一三三九倍，等於月初的二倍。這就是說：本期的生活費指數，約打了個七折。</p>
<p>全市職工們，拿到一三三九倍的工資，已是昨晚。可是昨天午前起，各種市場，都已開始漲風。像糧食五洋等，多數漲了二成；那就是說：一三三九倍的工資，無形中又打了八折。</p>
<p>這個教訓，在職工們已習慣到等於成為人類的本能，在今後幾天內，會立刻展開變貨運動的。因而今後幾天，才是財金當局能否控制市場的試金石。</p>
<p>過去一週內，資方敲出貨物，籌備昨天要發的薪資。財金當局乘勢行舟，獨得了控制市場的殊榮。今後數天，該是逆風的日子了。逆風裏把舵要難得多，因而能在逆風裏把舵的，才算有本領。</p>
<p>半個月前，美英間金融上的明爭暗門，在世界金市上，掀動了個不大不小的風潮。我們過去已再三分析過，那是：英國要抬高金價，抑低美鈔。美國要維持美鈔，抑住金價。所以美洲金價穩定，歐亞非三洲大陸上，金價上漲。</p>
<p>這個明爭暗門，在過去一週裏，似乎已近尾聲了。事實證明了英國的失敗，美國又勝利了。</p>
<p>世界各地的金價，上週內已先後回小了。法國的金價，更跌至八年來所僅見的低價。阿根廷原在英國唆使下，統制黃金，企圖刺激南美各國金市，跟看非洲上漲的。現在，阿根廷也把這種統制取消了。</p>
<p>英美的這次門爭中，蘇聯也在旁大做拉拉隊，甚且單刀匹馬，在米蘭·維也納·柏林·三地，肆意收購黃金，現在也停止收購了。而法蘭西銀行公佈法國存金達八億七千五百萬鎊一事，更促成了已　金價的慘跌。</p>
<p>當英國對美鈔搗蛋的時候，香港金市場，在遠東也盡了不少責任的。現在，英國即有掩旗息鼓的傾向，香港市場，照理也會發生反應的。但證之上週港地金鈔的走勢，僅僅表示了美鈔的堅穩而已。</p>
<p>本市金鈔價，除了本市風光的影響之外，香港的刺激也很大的。香港即還平穩，本市的金鈔，所以純由本地因素來決定其今後。</p>
<h3>銀根轉弛去化較旺　食米昨又昂挺　高白粳曾叩四萬元大關</h3>
<p>米市昨又回升，南米市場早開略加四五百元，旋因銀要轉鬆，米店納胃轉濃，在市上升二三千，薄稻一度抵四萬大關，後又因金價平疲，人心轉軟，價稍回平，薄稻收市三萬九千，軋升二千元。北市場白粳薄稻各開三萬八千元，各漲千五百元，特粳叩四萬關，二市場登記到貨，共計三千六百〇五石。</p>
<p>食油盤旋上升，因銀根略鬆及米價已先上海，故貨主扳持，豆油初開十四萬八千元，中市一度回低至十四萬六千元，最後大有豆油十五萬一千元，生菜油十四萬攻千收市，軋漲八千至九千元，生油漲五千，青島吉桶生油十八萬五千元，熟菜油茶油尚平，豆餅亦少上落。</p>
<p>麺粉市勢轉堅，初市以銀根轉鬆，北帮略有吸取，且米價挺升，人心甚為振奮，老車晨開緊逼萬六千關，兵船一度高做萬五千四百五十元，中途受黃金股票時起時落影響，市勢波動甚烈，收市後大戶納進頗力，兵船回升做萬五千三百元，老車喊做萬五千八百元，麩皮客胃街銷均淡，市勢略見下游。</p>
<p>雜糧受圈外轉堅影響，初市一致挺高，九江冬豆最開高做三萬三千元，本豆升做三萬一千五百元，後市以油餅轉疲，客銷廠胃轉呆，冬豆回挫一成，本豆跌進三萬關，生仁微揚五千元，苞米芝蔴後市轉疲。</p>
<h3>外銷茶堅定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據茶業關係人告稱：目前海外對於華茶雖仍垂愛，但最近因各物陡漲不已，茶葉成本莫不跟隨步砌，而與國外茶價逐漸脫節，出口乃乏　　。　英商怡和洋行一度對祁門紅茶，復圖展開攻勢，惟貨方堅守甚力，終又敗下陣來。綜觀此種情形，華茶外銷，暫無開朗之象，至其趨勢，一致靜中帶堅。</p>
<p>內銷茶雖以業中頭寸感緊蹙，然行市續以倘俐姿態出現唯一原因，陳茶存底空虛，新貨又未生產，種種關係，執戶售意不鬆，交易依然不多，只本街略有染指，其他各地仍未竄入活動。</p>
<h3>桐油平庸</h3>
<p>桐油趨勢，自隔日步走下坡後，昨市晨初，即因業中銀根鬆濫，同時外匯移轉證昂然邁進，賣戶板抬之念，遂又故態復萌，過程漸告上揚，惟買方鑒於海外行市疲頹，國內春銷懈怠，不欲迫切求取，是以形勢頗若曇花一現，急遽挫落，臨收結果，均與上日相仿，未見軒輊。</p>
<h3>木材上升</h3>
<p>杉木市價上漲至二百八十元，洋松柳安雖實銷清淡，惟配花色，市價須在八百元，柳安夾板已升至三千六百元。</p>
<h3>棉紗普遍盤升　布疋去胃不振</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市況，業內銀根轉鬆，外象均皆報挺，紗市亦隨見轉機，新買乃復逐步推動，華南方面另星採辦尚暢，本街亦有抵補，惟以拆息依然站住九十元左右，故人心仍有顧忌。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳初以二百七十二萬元開出，中途曾鬆落至二百六十二萬元，午收為二百六十六萬元，終挺十五萬元，四〇支藍鳳升十四萬元，三二支銀月高五萬元，以一百六十九萬元結束。二一花雙馬現貨自一百四十萬元開出後，即見下游，最低一百三十二萬元，近午因浮空抵補眾多，價乃略回至一百五十五萬元收市，終漲十三萬元。二〇支雙馬一百二十六萬元五千元，軋升六萬五千元，一六支亦跟踨上揚，一〇支則互有升沉。</p>
<p>棉布盤旋微升，客銷依然平淡，本街買意亦懈，綠因銀根雖略露鬆象，但市上拆息仍高，故一般均脫貨放息，致欲漲之局面復告回小。</p>
<p>龍頭細布始由五萬三千五百元之高檔開出，旋以同業逢高脫手甚眾，終於勢難力敵，退至五萬一千元收市，較前好起二千五百元。喇叭童細布挺二千元，四君子元嗶嘰初以五萬〇八百元開出後，一路喊高至五萬一千元，收市又迫入四萬九千元，軋升二千六百元。金蓮妙舞元嗶嘰高二千元。以四萬七千五百元結束，午後因生活指數發表較上期漲達一倍強，人心向昂，各布緩步挺升，最後聞四君子元嗶嘰做五萬四千二百元。</p>
<h3>中紡售布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售布，共開十八種，計售一一〇〇〇疋，零頭布七七〇〇磅。準購單四三三張，價值五六四，三三四，〇〇〇元。</p>
<h3>絲綢平穩</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市上銀根轉鬆，暗息回低，聞生活指數發表，人心激勵，買氣轉旺。一二〇號天橋晨開即期一七二萬五千元，中間聞黃金暴落，市告不支，一度小至一六二萬元，低後各方逢小即補，市又回升，終以一六四五〇〇〇元收市。午後聞金價盤升，圈外銀根再鬆，人心仍昂，市勢仍告盤升，隔日頭寸先做一八五萬，繼聞金價回小，市勢稍軟，終以一八三五〇〇〇元結束。</p>
<p>生絲優級另担初做二六〇萬，因銀根尚鬆，金價盤堅，吸意尚濃，高至二七〇萬元，高後多頭轉吐，市又回軟，近午以二六五萬元結束。</p>
<p>綢緞晨開時人心尚堅，場上買氣極旺，喊價上揚，美亞晨開一一九五〇〇〇元，一度高至一二二萬，高後聞棉紗回小，金價直落，人心突軟，回至一一九萬，午收時為一二〇萬三千元。午後市勢平穩，交易不旺，喊價微升萬元。</p>

<h3>仁餘勝恩卡斯　殺得難解難分　比數起伏賽情精彩紛呈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽昨晚精采紛呈，四十分鐘苦戰，仁餘以卅八比卅四獲最後勝利擊退強敵恩卡斯。比賽始終緊湊，此起彼落，上半時十八比十七，仁餘一分領前。下半時局勢，尤為緊張，十九，廿二，卅，一再平手，在卅比廿六時奧柴遼五次犯規離去，實為恩卡斯之致命傷。最後吳新運逢兇化吉，孫國政的妙射破籃，終以四分戰勝敵人。仁餘徐仲已沈鵬舉吳新運三將與恩卡斯之卻利勃脫昨晚最為活躍。仁餘是戰，表演着愈戰愈有精神的姿態，恩卡斯火氣太大，亦間接予仁餘以罰球機會不少。另場甲一組培斐爾勝海青五十六比卅六，甲二A　勛勝又一四十四比卅三。</p>
<p>昨晚球迷凡三千餘人，市化育館盛春一時，第三場仁餘對恩卡斯，尤為觀眾矚目。仁餘上場五人為孫國政，徐仲已，李肇和，吳新運，姚文彝。對方是卻利勃脫，奧柴遼，泊透，沙司金，格朋乞谷夫。</p>
<p>開寳未久，小姚犯規，泊透罰中開紀錄。卻利有若輕騎，增添二分，文彝一球，將功贖罪，三比二，新運傷足，鵬舉入代，仁餘兩次罰球未中，沈罰入各三平手。王槐庭代肇和，這裏有一次雙犯規，彼此都沒有進去。沙司金單臂遠中，其勢可畏。新運替國政，仁餘第五次罰球不進，卻利駕輕就熟，七比二。肇和代槐庭，邱區胡代沙司金，格朋乞仲已先後建功，格復得寸進尺，小姚一球，肇和推入，新運雙腳跳，仁餘力戰後，十一平手。不料奧柴遼邱區胡籃下摸索，泊透半場遠中，同樣邇中三元，報以顏色，十七比十四。四政替文彝，仲已新運飽受觀眾擁護，竟成十八比十七，以一分超出。又來雙方犯規，鵬舉奧柴遼難兄難弟，同病相憐，上半時仁餘即以十八比十七小佔優勢。</p>
<p>休息中間，仁餘洋教練楊氏，在那裏大發議論，頗引起恩卡斯球員不滿。十分鐘過去，再行接觸，奧阻擋犯規，新運添一分，俄頃又成十九平手。鵬舉一罰一擲，廿二比十九。卻利三分一氣呵成，又廿二平手。泊透動若脫兎，又以二分顛倒局面。一瞬間成廿九比廿二，恩卡斯更顯得順利。李姚恢復原狀，仁餘全力抗爭，追成卅比廿六。奧柴遼五次犯規，邱大胖子入代，仲已擲中，鵬舉兩隻罰球，又成各卅分，無分彼此。格朋乞的粗暴，給了國政一分，新運妙傳，仲已籃下勾進，遂多敵方三分。卻利輕取二球，反以一分超出。小吳逢兇化吉，贏一分。時間還有二分鐘，局勢千鈞一髪，國政可愛的一球，決定雙方命運。仲已罰球中的，卅八比卅四，仁餘得最後勝利。</p>

<p>彼此嚴密監視，下半時五分鐘後纔各中一球，紀錄牌又「二二」「三三」了好久，蘇石鳳昨晚的演出不錯，一舉一動，很有根底，衛禹平的偷冷飯，也令人冷不防，結果懋勛四四比三三勝。</p>

<h3>「黑吃黑」　培斐爾勝海青</h3>
<p>培斐爾對海青，兩支美軍，一場海戰；培斐爾苗頭十足，海青的傳球，老是被他們半途截去，雙方十個戰士中間，始終保持着三個以上黑人，生色（黑色）不少，上半時培斐爾卅一，海青十二。</p>
<p>海青於下半時很有作為，但在籃下有不少機會，自己可以投而仍傳給人家，這也足以表示他們不「自私」的精神。培斐爾的伊卡特與勃郞，海青的勃倫霍與凱克爾，為雙方主要人物，最後培斐爾克勒時以單刀直入獲分，雙方黑人釘黑人，有「黑吃黑」的姿態，五十六比三十六，培斐兩大勝海青。</p>

<h3>英海軍三度興師　今日會戰青白隊</h3>
<p>英海軍倫敦號足球隊，最近自港返滬，先後與華人強隊作二度友賽，首仗以一比一和鐵路，第二戰二比三小挫於龍頭，今日下午四時第三次出馬，與本市盟主青白隊交鋒於逸園球場，門票仍售普通四百元，特別座六百元，下午二時半起在市體育館發售，裁判何春暉，巡邊丁順寳，潘恩。青白會通告全體隊員盼穿紅黑球衣直接至逸園集合。</p>
<p>按青白為滬上足球祭酒，曾蟬聯三屆市長盃，本年於複賽時，因輕敵遭中航毒手，失去奪魁希望，惟聯賽甲組冠軍已似探攝取物，毫無問題，全隊在老將孟義良領導之下，有黃仕傑·姜閭關清·薜沛然·伏乃堂四騎士，拱衛後方，羅壽福·金祿生·顧以撤·劉隆韾·劉體寅五虎列陣前綫，軍容完整，無與匹敵。</p>

<h3>運動世界　論香港足球大勢　甲組亞軍中華希望較濃　乙組冠軍巴士頗具把握</h3>
<p>〔香港訊〕本屆甲組聯賽，冠軍雖必穩為南華南所得，但亞軍問題，已突因上星期一中華於苦戰中，再破一個對傑志難關，而巴士雖卒勝香港會，然勝來好險，遂又頓成微妙狀態，按甲組每隊雖共賽廿四場，中華已賽十九次，今後只餘五戰，須賽者為巴士，南華華，南華南，海軍，東方，照現下情形論事，則中華大有必能再奪六分之可能，蓋今後五關，最難過者，為南華南與巴士而已，巴士近來出賽每有時價不同之弊，其敗於海軍，雖云意外，然上星期日自在主場賽亂點鴛鴦之大檯客，演出亦未見佳妙，雖對方先曾射入十二碼罰球，亦僅小勝三對二而已，則今後八個關頭，他們將能多取幾分，確有令人替彼耽慮者在，蓋彼輩難關實比中華為多，捨最難之南華南一關外，彼輩尚須一賽中華，兩賽傑志，又須賽逢華隊必力賽不懈之聖約瑟與警察當前，俱不能謂為必勝之局面也。雖則對光華與空軍兩場可必勝，然如此又安能認為穩可得亞軍？</p>
<p>人謂亞軍誰屬，勢將決於本月廿六日巴士重逢中華之時，然在，我則謂果中華到時而勝，則亞軍固十九將屬中華，但倘其時勝利屬巴士，則吾仍以為未許為巴士樂觀，蓋傑志亦屬勁旅，一戰而勝已不易，況敢謂巴士必兩戰俱勝傑志耶？是以，我以為甲組亞軍問題，似非賽至本季節最後一週，未能作肯定語，在南南必得冠軍之情勢下，乃有此種點綴，足球聯賽，亦未致令觀眾太感乏味也。</p>
<p>一隊過強，未免削減興趣，無怪本屆看球人心理，殊不能提高至如戰前東南星三角競爭時程度，尚幸此後還有一幕甚可觀之賽事，即則聯賽冠軍對聯隊表演是，我以為到時聯隊能用譚均幹，高山龍，許竟成，韋打羅，侯律，馮坤勝，西維亞，李春發，鄧宜杰，鄒文治，李大輝以為陣，以為南南賽，則緊張處必不減華聯賽漢城時也。</p>
<p>乙組中華即兩勝九龍陸軍後，形勢亦甚微妙，蓋今中華雖以卅四分高踞榜首，然實際尚比巴士多失一分，今後尚有十戰，而有對南華，巴士，傑志，海軍等難關，言難關之所以并列入傑志與海軍，殆因中華初逢傑志時，只賽成三對三和局，遇海軍時亦僅勝一對零故云，巴士則尚有十三戰，難關有南華，傑志，海軍，香港陸軍，與九龍陸軍，是難關亦比中華為多也，然論人物，則乙組中實以巴士為最盛，吾仍以為冠軍呼聲，實以巴士為最高，隊境反不如其甲隊之甚也。（賴端甫）</p>
<h3>香港新奇賭法　發售足球彩票　每次賭注由十元至千元不等</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕本月十二日，九龍偵探部接獲線報，謂有人發售一種足球彩票，乃由華探長劉福，率領幹探葉發·謝炳林等，至金巴利道六十一號地下，拘得受嫌疑之歐籍男子一人，搜出此類彩票及說明書數十張，帶屬落案。當日并準被告具保五百元外出。該案昨解九龍裁判署寇司庭提堂。被告羅拔胡禮，四十五歲，蘇格蘭愛丁堡郡人，住金巴利道六十號地下，被控於本月十二日，在其住所內開設賭局之罪，昨被告未有到庭，九龍偵探處長莫道霖向庭申請押候，寇司諭將案押候今日審訊。據查此種足球彩票，曾盛行於英倫，惟在港地則尚屬初見，故其賭博之內容，未為社會人士所悉，而警方昨亦未予透露。惟自傳聞方面獲悉，此種彩票之購買，并不限定其金額，由十元以至千元不等，發售此種彩票者，成立一機關，專事接受此類賭徒之下注。蓋香港為遠東之足球王國，每有重要足球比賽，即萬人空巷，前往參觀，因之孰勝孰負，亦至為球迷所關懷，乃將各認為必勝之隊伍，下注作博，而每週末舉辦之足球聯賽，亦有多人下注，故此類彩票，係於一賭咒宰揭曉，惟其賭博之種類甚多，除下注何隊勝利外，更有賭每一球員入球數之多寡，及第一球由何人射入，第二球由何人射入等等，有類於賽馬之購買位置票。茍如爆出冷門時，則下注購買此冷門者獲利頗鉅，因之有閒階級，趨之若鶩，據聞售賣此種彩票者，派彩係採取分帳辦法，即先除出其所欲得之利益外，再將此全部賭款收入計彩。由於購買之人頗多，故其獲利頗有可觀云。</p>
<h3>女子籃球術</h3>
<p>— 周公譯述</p>
<p>許久就想寫一些關於女子籃球戰術的文字，因為：微聞籃委會當局有擬在市長盃賽中採用加拿大女子規則之準備，因是又擱起筆來。</p>
<p>上週碰到一位籃場的女健將，她說各方祇注意在研究男子的戰術，而對於女子戰術一般人提及的也的也較少，未免有重男輕女之嫌；由於她這一番說話的諷刺，又鼓舞起我的精神來執筆，這雖然是一些零碎的女子籃球攻守戰術，對於初學打籃球的隊伍也許會成為適用的教材。</p>
<p>無論在任何一種運動正確的基本動作就是一位運動員必要有的基礎，能够有正確的基本動作，運用得純熟，再加添上寶貴的經驗，才成為一位成熟的運動員，在一隊籃球隊裏而擁有六員成熟的球員，由指導訓以施展戰術之方式，運用到爛熟，然因熟且更能生巧，這一隊球隊便會成為勁旅。</p>
<p>在練習時，可以見到有些球員，用雙手作固定式投籃之動作還未見得是正確，他或她就去演習隻手投籃；，足部和轉身之動作還未純熟，致往往持球在手時就犯着持球行走之動作。</p>
<p>所以，許多球隊都是側重採用戰術之打法而球員方面卻疏忽了個人之基本動作之練習和改正，致打來動作勉強，未見圓滑，毛手毛腳，動輒犯規；茍不在基本動作上根本改善，則技巧如逆水行舟，不進則退，欲成為天驥之戰，又焉可得？</p>
<p>王陽明先生說：「君子之於射也，內志正，外體直，持弓矢審固，而後可以言中」。這是指出學射者若沒有內志正，外體直之存心，則雖持弓注矢，引滿而發，亦不獲中的。</p>
<p>又墨子說：「良弓難張，然後可以及高八深，良馬難乘，然後可以任重致遠。」這也是說好弓難張，若果難運用到正確的張弓方法，可以將箭射得高，放得遠；好馬難騎，若能懂得駕馭的正確方法，可以任重致遠。一位籃球員若要成為未來之球壇健將，就必須要從正確之動作入手，必先要有正確的基本動作，熟練地運用，第二步就可以踏入戰術運用之門了。</p>
<p>美國加里福尼亞大學之Frrest　Foornan氏，對於女子籃球之防禦戰術，頗有心得，以下就是他對於女子籃球防禦戰術的見解。</p>
<p>籃球在防禦戰術上言；有很大的進步，亦有很大的變化，分為（一）人釘人之防禦制，（二）固定區域防禦制，（三）移動區域防禦制。</p>
<p>人釘人之防禦制是每一位守衛分別負責看守着一個對手，影趨則趨，影止則止。</p>
<p>固定區域防禦制是每一位守衛要負責看管着自己的區域，不讓進攻者得到闖入投籃區域內之機會。</p>
<p>移動區域防禦制是三位守衛聯要成一體，須有默契之合作，在移動時須互相填補位置。</p>
<p>分別而論，人釘人之防禦戰術是較易施展，一位富有經通信班　的球員寗願採用人釘人之防禦方式；為着他祇須釘牢着一個進攻者，皮球到進攻者之手上時，彼之影趨則趨，彼之影止則止，不讓她容易得到把握的投籃機會。（未完）（一）</p>
<h3>上週籃球評述　第二循環中洋兵有顯著進步</h3>
<p>上週甲一組兩戰，華聯於新收之後發奮圖強，五六比四二輕取海青；麥令斯經甘練後，運用戰術，五七比四二克狀態不佳之滬警；由於培斐爾之勝華聯與麥令斯之皮滬警，洋兵球隊在第二循環賽中有顯著的進步，將來在市長盃賽中，華隊強旅誠未易安枕也。</p>
<p>後期之海青實力不及前期之海青，前期的海青尚擁有一位黑籍長子，還有一位用左手控球的守衛，這期的海青，全隊中沒有一員精於控球的好手，祇憑勇而乏智；在防守方面箝制不住華聯之前鋒，在上半時開場未幾就暴露出漏洞，被華聯數度施展迅攻法而得獲多分，迫使海青守勢全部崩潰。</p>
<p>在進攻方面，海青沒有攻破華聯人釘人之防禦陣方方式，沒有一員精於控球來製造機會的好手，在被迫到無法施展時，就有誤傳浪擲之演出；所以華聯之急攻疾速，投籃準繩，在上半時以卅八對十八迫使海青氣不暇喘，整個都是挨打局面。下半時華聯是用緩攻法，盡控籃下球，取勝之易不費吹灰之力，是戰以至強而臨至弱，無異是以卵擊石，毫無精彩可言。</p>
<p>滬警在最近兩戰在低潮狀態中，適與正在進步而在巔峰狀態下演出之麥令斯相逢，故難免一敗。</p>
<p>控制籃下球為麥令斯破滬警之優先條件，在全局比賽中，籃下球幾全被洋兵控制着，及至王榕生被罰出場與史久全調出後，麥令斯之長子控制籃下球，為所欲為，滬警於是時失分較多，大勢去矣。</p>
<p>滬警是靠射籃有術而取勝，手風一順，十投九中而從得氣勢而得打上路，無奈在此戰中上場時就狀態不佳，精於遠投的王伯文十投而僅一中，在麥令斯之嚴密區域防禦制下，居中策應衛無法施展，交又切入又遭遇到阻撓，在尖角處投籃，失多於得，茍不中的而籃下球全落在洋兵之長子手上，滬警得分祇靠王榕生，梁榮標之元投，傳其俠與何增之偶爾得到竄進之機會而已。球隊之狀態不佳，球員雖勇亦怯，全失自信心，滬警之失常有甚於對華聯之戰，大抵因練習過勤而感疲勞所致，在本週內球員應注意充份之休息。</p>
<p>麥令斯在巔峰狀態下演出有穩健之防守，進攻時藉煙幕切入籃下托入，清晰美觀，在對方籃下擲界外球時是運用三人之平排戰術，惜運用未見純熟，遠不及培斐爾隊演出之佳，長人利斯是全隊之靈魂，彼是一位精於控球者，不特是個人獨得廿八分還替他鋒做成得分之機會，贏球是靠一隊之打法，個人絕無油腔花巧之演出，諸將年青，經驗尚淺，但技術在進步中，是觀眾最歡迎之一隊洋兵球隊。（戚公）「」</p>

<h3>記鄕下的米票</h3>
<p>— 企年</p>
<p>鄉下的「米票」，猶如各大城市的「袁大頭」一樣，近半年來在京滬沿綫蘇·崑一帶的鎭集上應運而生。它受人的寵愛，遠勝於堂堂的金圓劵，在鄕鎭上嘖實奪主，儼然通貨矣。</p>
<p>遠在去年「八一九」限價時，食糧存量限制頗嚴，於是鄉人們就把過多的餘糧，寄存到各米行中，以避免檢查人員的耳目。於是行方就發給一紙，上面書明品名，數量及存戶姓名等項目，這原是一種收據式的存票。安知不久以後，因環境事實的需要，竟脫穎而出，在市集上相互授受，成為今日鄕鎭上流行極廣的「米票」了。</p>
<p>論它的本身，樸實無華，外觀遠不及金圓券。薄薄的一張道林紙，黑墨印刷，算是最考究的了。不然，一小方白報紙，用毛筆寫後，再加蓋上一顆古色古香的珠砂紅店印，也便成事。再不然，連一張整潔的紙張也捨不得用，索性用一張香烟紙壳，或牙粉袋之流的廢紙，在背後空白部份上寫上幾個字，蓋一個章，因陋就簡的，竟也可應市，同樣的能受到鄕人們的信任與珍藏。</p>
<p>「米票」上往往加上一句「按市結價，裝貨不憑」的註語。於是無形中雖形成一張徒具虛名，不可兌現的支票，可是在鄉鎭上，它有它巨大的魔力。在物價動盪激烈的時候，假使以金圓券去購貨，店方往往有所限制；可是若代以「米票」作交易，店夥們便笑逐顏開，任你多大的數量，也都樂於與你作往來。相反的，鄕人們醫如養肥了豬仔，帶到市鎭上出議，假使給以現鈔，他們却都面露難色，要求可有「米票」。有時往往以「米票」作交易時，雖削價若干，也心所甘受。「米票」與金圓券，固同為一紙，可是兩者之間，在鄕鎮人民的心理上，竟有天壤之別，這豈僅祗是幸與不幸之事耶。</p>
<p>近時農村不靖，農民家儲米糧，易受盜匪覬覦，於是更心甘情願的將米運入市鎭，換上「米票」。如此後，雖經盜失，尙可掛失止付，作為補救。並且薄薄一紙，貯置衣襲，携帶靈便，須用現鈔時，更可隨時按市結價，絕不受紙幣貶值影響。行方也任你一斗兩斗或一石兩石的去支付，祗要在票上一注，也決不嫌你麻煩。</p>
<p>在米行老闆們，一面可以將存入的米糧，作為流動資金；一面在「裝貨不憑」的條件下，這批交易，卽可放心的在他行中，決無他往的恐懼，於是也都樂於接受鄉民們的存放。如此，「米票」在鄉鎮上滿街飛的情形，遠勝過都市裏的銀行支票，此亦亂世中的一件奇事也。</p>
<h3>銀元的毛病與鑑別</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>本談已兩載論「銀圓」之文，而銀圓「買進」「賣出」的呼聲，又已偏於全市。然銀圓之疵病甚多，且有贋品，在昔銀圓為本位時代，人人習見銀圓，尙難免被欺，今則歷十餘年，且購買者多屬外行，未知弊病，自易上當。爰將鑑別銀圓疵病及贗品之法，略述如次。</p>
<p>（一）銼邊：卽銀圓周圍高起之花邊，已被銼去，以取銀層。致分量减輕。</p>
<p>（二）藥水：曾投銀圓於硝鏹水中，蝕取其銀。</p>
<p>以上二項，均能使銀團分量减輕，但留心細察，亦尙易辨。因藥水，則銀圓花紋，難免失神或糢糊；銼邊則細察其花邊目知。若在黃時熱手，但以銀圓置中指尖上托之，便知其分量之不足矣。</p>
<p>（三）夾銅；此非熟練匠人不能辦，其法以鋸鋸開銀圓之一面，挖取其中之銀，以銅補之，然後將銀面蓋好，裝嵌完妥，表面不易察知。但此與必重量减輕，因所補之銅，不能將挖處補滿，補滿則成「啞版」，必須稍留空處，故重量當然不足。又此圓若擊其邊，則其裝嵌之一面，必顯裂痕；又觀其面上花紋，必較生硬，聞其聲亦覺不同。但此則非熟手不能辨也。</p>
<p>（四）補銅：在銀圓面上之花紋凹凸處，選其可資挖補者，挖去一小塊，以銅補好。粗看自不易辨，細看總覺有異。</p>
<p>（五）全銅：此係置幣，其質純銅，外鍍以銀，以兩圓擊之，其音寬而尖，花紋亦甚生硬。</p>
<p>（六）全鉛：卽純以鉛質鑄成銀圓，初出亦能混充，但多經汗漬，卽漸變色，與銀色對比，亦易辨也。</p>
<p>總之，細心察看，雖外亦不易欺；粗心浮氣，則縱老手亦難免上當。又有一法，以兩指箝銀圓，口吹以氣，近耳聽之，整個作微響而營長者為眞，否則為偽。是亦一術，然恐不能悉辨上述諸疵弊也。</p>
<h3>豆漿</h3>
<p>— 桑</p>
<p>豆漿又稱豆腐漿，在我國是一種極普通的豆製食物，尤其在上海，更是極平民化的大衆飲料。可是歐美各國却直到近年來才發現了牠的價值，而美其名稱之為「豆乳」。</p>
<p>最近根據美國許多科學家的研究，已得到了一個極高的評價，而加以提倡，以代牛乳了。</p>
<p>豆乳和牛乳相似，其成份極似人乳，而較之為優，牠含有人乳的二份之一的脂肪和蛋白質，等量的石灰質，和二倍於人乳的鐵質。牠缺乏炭水化合物，這點正好可作為患糖尿病的相宜食物；而需要的話，也可以加乳糖或是麥芽糖來彌補。</p>
<p>豆乳較牛乳易於消化。因為豆乳在胃中組成的凝結物較牛乳為小，其需要的胃消化液也就少了。</p>
<p>豆乳還能够避免許多牛乳所能引起的疾病·牠的製迭手續旣便利，價格又低廉，產量又大。可是一般國人都不知進一步研究改進它的生產方法和養分，徒知墨守陳法。更有那些歐化的紳士們，以豆漿為販夫走卒的食料而不屑一顯。現在連科學最發達最進步的美國也來研究且讚揚豆乳了，不知那般「月亮外國好」的先生們，聽之有何感想？</p>

<h3>「蓬拆」救國及其他</h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>這題目，一看，似乎有點不大莊嚴；然而却又是事實。過去，我們確有過「跳舞救國」，而且也高喊過這口號。而今，「華中剿總政委會為增加自衛特捐數目，刻正考慮開放舞禁」，問時，記者更加按語云：「漢市久已歛跡之蓬拆聲，卽將復起」云（俱見本報漢口九日電）。</p>
<p>自衛是保民，保民也卽是救國。因此，漢市當局此次的開放舞禁，雖沒有明白喊出「跳舞救國」的口號，但要藉開放舞禁以增强救國的工作，則是相同的。不過纏夾先生們却萬不可將跳舞和救國混為一談，以為唯跳舞可以救國，要教國便只有跳舞；否則，便會誤會到當局，對於跳舞的或開放或禁止，以及甲地開放乙地禁止的苦衷，以致發生當局有時准許救國，有時禁止救國，或甲地准許救國，乙地禁止救國之類的思想，那就失之千里了。</p>
<p>從我個人說，對於跳舞，我是旣不喜歡，也不憎恨，因為我根本不會跳舞。但跳舞並不是什麼罪惡的行為，我是確信的。確信的理由，也不是因為「外國也有的」，而是確是事實。至於因跳舞而發生的若千壞事，也不過等於若干人在堂皇冠冕的大題目下，作更大的壞事一樣。這是人的問題。</p>
<p>但不久以前，跳舞在更大的「改正風俗」，「實行節約」的大題目下，禁止了，而且又禁止得那麼雷厲風行。雖說上海因舞女們的一打，因而把禁政弛緩了下來，然而禁還是要禁的。按次抽籤，就表示禁定了。</p>
<p>旣然是禁定了，則當局自然認為跳舞是罪惡的行為，了無疑義。我們小百姓站在擁護當局施政的立塲，也實踐了「當局之所惡，惡之」，不是官民合作的好模範嗎？而且這好模範已在加大了。</p>
<p>然而漢市這次却因為增加特捐而重開禁令了。特捐是重要的，但可以因為它的重要，便不需「改正風俗」，不需「實行節約」嗎？或者是漢市經一度禁舞之後，風俗業己改正，節約業已實行了嗎？</p>
<p>如果答案是後者，我們眞為禁舞的成績慶幸，但同時又為開舞以後的風俗躭心；如果是前者，則更躭心「寓禁於徽」的範圍，將要日益加大了。</p>
<p>此雖小事，但亦可悟其他。</p>
<h3>歌王平克勞斯貝</h3>
<p>— 欣</p>
<p>平克勞斯貝，今天已成為美國的第一流藝人了。憑着他的一條嗓子，從舞台，而話筒，而銀幕，他的聲調，誰都覺得甜潤悅耳，心上都好像着了魔似的。當他唱出一支新歌，數萬册的歌曲可以片刻銷光。他灌的唱片，都成了最暢銷的商品。</p>
<p>平克勞期貝自己認為沒有得意的歌喉，他踏上歌王的寳座，到現在自己還覺得有些莫明其妙。他離開學校之時，並沒有想走上歌唱之路，因為他是一個極平常的人，顯不出有什麼特長。他的哥哥，也只曉得他還勤快而已。他們弟兄兩人，當時以為唱歌是最輕易的工作，就走上了這一條路，使他今天成為一顆燦爛的歌星。</p>
<p>最初，平克勞期貝是為狄卡公司灌片。第二年，又在派拉蒙公司工作。當平克勞斯貝走上歌唱之途時，他趁自己的歌喉，順自己的意向，把所有傳統的歌唱規則，破壞無餘。他雖然不激照歌唱的規則，可是這種新的音調，却大受人們歡迎。狄卡和派拉蒙兩公司，都不肯議他離職。</p>
<p>平克勞斯貝以唱歌為職業，迄今已有二十年了。在道二十年中，除去舞台上的歌唱，無綿電的廣播，無法留下紀錄外，在蠟盤上留下記錄的，有六百九十八支歌曲。其中一曲，是十五年前所灌的聖誔節讀美詩「聖潔之夜」，是平克勞斯貝最負盛譽的歌聲，也是最暢銷的一張唱片。留在膠片聲帶上的，有三十八部影片，最近還有一張「在約瑟王法庭中」，已拍好了，尙未上映·一九四四年，由於在「與我同行」一片中扮演奧馬利神父，而被電影藝術科學院評選為最佳演員。可是到今天，平克勞斯貝祗承認自己是一個歌星，而不是一個影星。</p>
<p>平克勞斯貝是一個典型的美國人，說話，態度，生活，都全是美國作風。就是他唱歌的嗓子和腔調，也道地美國化。他處處地方，喜歡以本來面目相見，我們在銀幕上所看到的，大都是他眞面目，就是扮演別的角色，也和他的本來姿態相稱的。平克勞斯貝還有一種特點，就是他永遠不會冷塲。他無論做什麼事，唱歌也好，跳舞也好，就是靜靜地站在一邊也好，都能顧示他的個性，使別人有一印象。</p>
<p>現今，平克勞斯貝已是一個收入很大的人了。可是他早年是在漂泊中過生活的。當他愛上了影星李狄絲，要和她論嫁娶時，曾被人挑撥，說他旣沒有錢，又無特長，將來的生活可虞。如今他雖已脫穎而出，但仍不忘記過去的貧賤時候。他的家庭，在洛杉磯俱樂部附近，生活過得很樸素，毫無豪華的氣息。在播音室中，最喜歡和助手，工人等交談。他說：「這些人才是正大光明的，和他們往來，最是痛快。」這話，是平克勞斯貝說別人，但也正是別人對他的感覺。</p>

<h3>Director He Arrives in Beijing and Makes a Statement: Peace Talks Are Expected to Proceed Quickly; Government Representative Candidates Will Be Changed; Foreign Policy Will Continue to Implement a "Pro-Humanity and Good Neighbor" Policy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The newly appointed President of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai at 2:30 PM on the 15th by special train. His wife, Ms. Wang Wenxiang, Bei He Zongyan, Chief of General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense Gu Zhutong, Section Chief Liu Wenjin, and others accompanied him. Secretary-General of the Presidential Office Weng Wenyuan, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan Chen Kewen, Vice President of the Control Yuan Liu Zhe, and the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, including Bai Chongxi, Xu Yongchang, Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, and more than a hundred representatives, all welcomed him at Xiaguan Railway Station. Mr. He was wearing a suit and overcoat with a happy expression on his face. His wife was wearing a black woolen coat. After getting off the train, they shook hands with those who came to greet them and exchanged pleasantries before getting into a car and returning to the official residence at Jiming Temple. At 5:00 PM, he met with reporters and stated that the new cabinet would strive for a peace that suits China's situation, conforms to the people's opinions, and is fair and just, in order to lay the foundation for a united and democratic China with long-term stability and security. Mr. He also said that peace talks with the Chinese Communist Party are expected to proceed quickly. As to whether the peace talk representatives will be changed or slightly increased, Mr. He replied that some of the representatives appointed by the previous Executive Yuan have firmly declined, such as Peng Zhaoxian, who must be replaced, but no increase has been considered yet. Secondly, Mr. He emphasized the importance of linking peace with the current economic problems. When reporters asked him about his meeting with financial figures in Shanghai and what countermeasures he had to rescue the economy, Mr. He replied that his understanding of economic policy was like "a blank sheet of paper," but after studying it and discussing it with financial figures in Shanghai for several hours yesterday, he had come to understand that there was always a solution, but a policy must have the support of the people nationwide in order to be effective. At the same time, economic problems are linked to peace. With peace, people's lives can be stabilized, and the economy will thus be stable. On the issue of US aid, Mr. He believed that if any country knows of China's difficulties and provides assistance, we should accept it. Subsequently, Mr. He answered inquiries regarding foreign policy, stating that the foreign policy will continue to implement the previous policy of "pro-humanity and good neighbor." Regarding military reform, he replied that military reform is our current most important task, and military leaders in all regions advocate this. Finally, Mr. He answered the following questions regarding the various issues of forming the cabinet: the formation of the new cabinet is not yet complete since there was no prior preparation, so the decision on the list of names and when it will be announced are still pending. Moreover, the Executive Yuan's plan to simplify the organization is currently being discussed in the Legislative Yuan, so it is not yet known how the various ministries and commissions will be merged. We will discuss it further after meeting with Legislative Yuan member Chen Guyuan, who proposed the plan. Mr. He also said that it is currently very difficult to find people from all sides because they are scattered in the north and south. It is very difficult to form the cabinet immediately in this very short period of time. Regarding the results of inviting Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, and Zhang Shijian, as well as members of the Democratic and Youth Parties, to join the cabinet in Shanghai, Mr. He reported that Yan and Jiang had both decided not to participate, while Zhang had agreed to consider it. The Democratic Socialist Party's reply was that it would be decided after the party meeting. The Youth Party has accepted the intention to join the cabinet. Mr. He also said that the number of cabinet members given to the Youth Party is still one minister. Regarding the issue of Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, and Wu Tiecheng joining the cabinet, Mr. He said that after seeking the opinions of the three, Zhang had agreed to participate, Wu had expressed that he could consider it, and Shao was unwilling to serve as a cabinet member but was still willing to be a peace representative. Mr. He finally said that the position of Deputy President of the Executive Yuan has not yet been considered, and he denied the rumor that Gu Weijun had been invited to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs. This press conference of Mr. He's was held outdoors in his official residence after being surrounded by reporters. Mr. He's attitude was amiable.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li Visits Mr. He: The First Draft of the Government's Peace Talk Plan Will Be Handed Over Within Days; The Formation of the New Cabinet May Take a Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] Acting President Li personally visited President He's official residence at Jiming Temple at 3:15 PM on the 15th. Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, and Wu Zhongxin were all present at the time. Acting President Li immediately had a close-door talk with the four in his living room for nearly two hours, which ended at 5:00 PM. It is believed that they were discussing matters related to the formation of the cabinet, and the sound of laughter and conversation reached the outside, which seemed to indicate that there were many optimistic prospects for the deployment of the new cabinet. At about 8:00 PM in the evening, Mr. He went to Chuanhougang to pay his respects to Acting President Li and further discussed the candidates for the new cabinet until he returned to his official residence at nearly 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The first task of He Yingqin's new cabinet after its formation is to intensify preparations for the peace talks. The change of President of the Executive Yuan has in fact delayed the start date of the peace talks. Mao Zedong told the Shanghai People's Delegation that the peace talks would be best to start after March 15th, but as of the 15th, the government's preparations have not been completed. The preliminary opinions of the government's peace talk plan drafted by the ten-member group led by Sun Ke have been studied several times by Acting President Li and important officials such as Zhang Cui, Bai Chongxi, Cheng Qian, and Wu Zhongxin. In order to show respect for the facts of the cabinet's tenure, Acting President Li will transfer the opinions to He Yingqin. The task of Sun Ke's ten-member group has been completed, and He Yingqin will decide how to study in the future. The peace talk plan must also be approved by the He cabinet before it can be discussed. As for the government's peace talk representatives, in addition to Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi continuing to serve, Huang Shaohong's intention to resign has been retained by Acting President Li and can be expected to be dismissed. In the future, only two or three other people need to be selected, and the candidates will also be decided by the new Executive Yuan meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The process of forming the new cabinet may take a week. As far as can be ascertained so far, the cabinet members invited by Mr. He include people from all walks of life, and especially attach importance to authoritative figures who have always advocated peace. Therefore, Mr. He's new cabinet is obviously a cabinet of peace. It is heard that Mr. He once invited Wu Tiecheng to serve as the Deputy President of the new cabinet. Wu had agreed to go to Guangzhou to handle the handover matters and then return to Beijing for further consideration. Some people believe that Huang Shaogu has the greatest possibility of becoming the Secretary-General, followed by Hong Lanyou, Zhang Daofan, and Peng Zhaoxian. As for the most important Ministry of Finance, Xu Kan may continue to serve as the minister, while Lu Xuen's Minister of Foreign Affairs is one member who is closely watched but difficult to find an answer. As for whether the Minister of National Defense will be concurrently held by Mr. He, Mr. He told reporters that he has not considered it yet. It is also heard that Fan Yushui and Wang Qijiang, both members of the Legislative Yuan, have been recommended to join the cabinet, but there is no news about the results.</p>
<h3>Members of the Legislative Yuan Send a Letter to Mr. He Suggesting Careful Selection of Cabinet Members</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] On the day that He Yingqin arrived in Beijing to begin forming his cabinet, some members of the Legislative Yuan sent a letter to Mr. He criticizing him and making suggestions on personnel issues. The letter stated: "The country is in a difficult situation, and it is becoming more and more serious. The people are suffering, and they are in dire straits. Since the advocacy of peace, the situation has changed, and the political foundation is entirely based on reform. A glimmer of hope depends on the new cabinet, which is extremely important and significant. We agree with your appointment to form the cabinet, one to accomplish the task of peace talks, and the other to implement thorough reform measures. We hope that you will be careful from beginning to end, and do not allow stubborn elements who believe in military force to join, which will block the door to peace. Do not let incompetent opportunists fill the posts, which will block the path to talent. Those who have failed, how can they be tried again? Those who are dying are eager for regeneration. Water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it. The support or opposition of the people is the barometer of the government. We dare to offer direct advice, and we hope you will consider it carefully." The letter was signed by Jing Juetian, Kong Geng, Rong Chunlin, Huang Jianzhong, Li Feng, Luo Xiatian, Li Shijun, Gan Jiaxin, Zhang Pingjiang, Miao Qiping, Lu Yuwen, and more than 30 others.</p>
<h3>Control Yuan Impeaches Sun Ke for Secretly Ordering the Allocation of Funds to Several Banks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The case of former President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke's handwritten order to Minister of Finance Xu Kan to allocate 110 million gold yuan from the secret office expenses when the Executive Yuan was evacuated has been investigated by Control Yuan members Yu Peihou, Ni Bi, and others. It was found that the funds were allocated to the China Industrial Bank and then distributed to several banks and money houses. The two members, Yu and Ni, formally filed an impeachment and submitted it to the nine-member review committee on the afternoon of the 15th for review and establishment. The allocated funds were also requested by the Control Yuan to Acting President Li to order the Executive Yuan to recover them.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Will Return to Wuhan Within Days; Cheng Qian Returns to Hunan, Chen Cheng Flies from Taiwan to Beijing; Wang Lingji Is Scheduled to Leave Chongqing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] Bai Chongxi will return to Wuhan from Beijing within one or two days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou, 15th] Yu Chairman Zhang Zhen arrived in Wuhan by car at 5:00 PM on the 15th to pay his respects to Commander-in-Chief Bai and report on the situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changsha, 15th] Cheng Qian flew from Beijing to Hengyang on the 15th, changed to a special train on the Yuehan Railway, and arrived in Changsha at 10:30 PM that night.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taipei, 15th] Chen Cheng, along with Yan Jiagan and his entourage, flew to Beijing on a special Tianxiong plane at 2:40 PM on the 15th. Wang Shijie and his wife arrived in Taipei from Taichung at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 15th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 15th] Wang Lingji and Minister of Finance Ren Shishang flew from Chengdu to Chongqing on the 15th and will fly to Beijing with Yang Sen on the 16th. Mr. Wang stated that the main purpose of his trip to Beijing was to stabilize Sichuan's economy, seek solutions to the currency shortage, and request approval for a 4 billion loan for the Sichuan Silk Industry Company. As for the overall plan for peace talks, he will follow the orders of the central government. Moreover, Sichuan is making every effort to maintain stability and can quell the unrest. Regarding the number of troops in Sichuan, the provincial government has decided at a meeting to reduce the total quota by two-thirds, and Sichuan grain will continue to be shipped east as usual.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Third Reading, Streamlining Administrative Organizations, Amending Articles 3 and 5 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law, Cutting and Merging Eight Ministries, One Commission, and One Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] On the day that the newly appointed President of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin, arrived in Beijing to officially begin forming his cabinet, the Legislative Yuan quickly and smoothly passed the third reading of the plan to streamline administrative organizations, amending Articles 3 and 5 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law. With a bold and decisive approach, eight ministries, one commission, and one bureau were cut and merged, reducing the number of ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan by nearly one-half. The reason why the plan was quickly passed was to cooperate with the political reforms advocated by Acting President Li, so that Mr. He Yingqin could organize the cabinet according to the new organization law. The amended Executive Yuan Organization Law retains only the eight ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Finance, Education, Judicial Administration, Economy, and Transportation, the two commissions of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs, and one directorate of Accounting. The four ministries and commissions of Agriculture and Forestry, Water Conservancy, Industry and Commerce, and Resources are merged into the Ministry of Economy. The Ministry of Food is changed to the Food and Grain Administration, which is subordinate to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Social Affairs is abolished, and the Social Affairs Department is established in the Ministry of Interior to manage social administration. The Ministry of Budget and Accounting is changed to the Directorate of Accounting, which is subordinate to the Executive Yuan. As for the new cabinet bureau, it will be abolished. In the future, there will be only ten ministers兼任部會者in the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Committee, and seven not兼部會者, together with the President and Vice President, a total of 19 people, will form the Political Affairs Conference, which will be responsible for the planning and promotion of national political affairs. The Legislative Yuan's meeting on the 15th spent almost all of the morning and afternoon discussing the plan. During the meeting, there were several heated debates and repeated discussions and votes before a conclusion was reached. The original plan was proposed by Legislative Yuan member Chen Guyuan and others, and only Article 3 was amended. The review opinion was that the News Bureau and the proposed裁改of the Directorate of Accounting, the Labor Bureau, and the Resources Bureau involved Article 5, so Article 5 was amended accordingly. When the meeting opened on the morning of the 15th, the Procedure Committee suggested that the plan should be discussed in advance in order to meet the needs. Chairman Tong Guanxian obtained the consent of the members and announced the review opinions for discussion. The members spoke one after another, expressing their support for the principle of simplifying administrative organizations. However, there were different opinions on which organizations should be cut and merged and which should be retained. Some advocated retaining the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, some advocated changing the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, which would be subordinate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, some opposed abolishing the Ministry of Land Administration, and some advocated merging Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce into the Ministry of Economy. A member proposed that in order to facilitate the discussion, the review opinions should be decided one by one. The proposal was adopted by the meeting, and the discussion began department by department. There was no objection to the five departments that should be retained: Interior, Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Finance, and Education. When discussing the Ministry of Judicial Administration, some people advocated that the Ministry of Judicial Administration should be returned to the Judicial Yuan and that it was not necessary to establish a ministry. However, due to the provisions of the Constitution, the opinion was rejected. When discussing the merger of the two ministries of Agriculture and Forestry and Water Conservancy into the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy, some members advocated that it should be truly simplified and that the four ministries and commissions of Agriculture and Forestry, Water Conservancy, Industry and Commerce, and Resources could be merged into the Ministry of Economy. Those who advocated retaining the name of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry strongly opposed it, and after a long debate, the majority passed the merger of the four departments into the Ministry of Economy. Continuing the discussion of the Ministry of Transportation and the two commissions of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs, there were no major objections. Some people advocated that the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission could be changed to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior, but the number of co-signers was insufficient, and the amendment was not established. Both were passed according to the review opinions. When discussing the departments that should be cut and merged, the review opinion of "abolishing the Ministry of Social Affairs and establishing a Labor Bureau directly under the Executive Yuan for labor affairs" was passed. However, after the second讚通過of the entire plan, this decision was rejected by a member. After another vote, it was changed to "abolishing the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the social administration will be handled by the Social Affairs Department established by the Ministry of Interior, and its affiliated organs will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior." The Ministry of Land Administration was changed to the Land Administration Bureau, and the Ministry of Health was changed to the Health Administration Bureau, both subordinate to the Ministry of Interior. There was only a slight discussion before they were passed. The Ministry of Food was changed to the Food and Grain Administration, which was subordinate to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Budget and Accounting was changed to the Directorate of Accounting, which was subordinate to the Executive Yuan, and there was no objection to任意球新聞避兩議. A member strongly argued that the Resources Commission should not be merged into the Ministry of Economy, but the case had already been decided and could not be changed. After the discussion of each department was completed, someone proposed that in addition to the abolished and merged departments, the remaining departments should also be streamlined as much as possible, and all organization laws should be amended as soon as possible. The proposal was approved by a majority of the members. As for the abolished organs, their original business was also decided to be assigned to the relevant organs for handling according to their nature and included in the resolution. The chairman then ordered the amended text to be read and sought the consent of the members, omitting the third reading procedure. The amendment to Articles 3 and 5 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law was completed.</p>
<p>The revised articles are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 3 The Executive Yuan shall establish the following ministries, commissions:</p>
<p>(1) Ministry of Interior</p>
<p>(2) Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>(3) Ministry of National Defense</p>
<p>(4) Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>(</p>
<p>5 )Ministry Of Educatiom</p>
<p>(6) Ministry of Judicial Administration</p>
<p>(7) Ministry of Economy</p>
<p>(8) Ministry of Transportation</p>
<p>(9) Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission</p>
<p>(10) Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission</p>
<p>The organization of each ministry and commission shall be determined by law.</p>
<p>Article 5 The Executive Yuan shall establish a Directorate of Accounting, the organization of which shall be determined by law.</p>
<h3>Review of the Proposal to Stop the徴兵徵糧, Decided to Report to the 22nd Council Meeting, Changed the Motion to Stop the Price Increase of Transportation Enterprises to a Questioning Motion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The fifth meeting of the Third Committee of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 15th. The meeting opened at 9:30 in the morning with 178 people in attendance.

<h3>The US President Is Watching the Evolution of the Situation in China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 14th] The White House and the State Department remain silent on General He Yingqin's appointment to form a cabinet. In Congress, the call for the United States to adopt a more active China policy in support of aid to China is rising, but formal discussions on the China issue have yet to begin. As for the temporary aid to China plan from April 3 to June 31, it will be approved soon. White House officials said that President Truman is closely watching the evolution of the situation in China and is very concerned about the political situation in Nanjing. He apparently regularly receives classified reports on China, which are studied by the National Security Council under his leadership, but no decision has yet been made. What is of most concern to the United States policy makers is still the outcome of the KMT-CPC peace talks. It is generally recognized that the Chinese crisis is a very important issue for the United States.</p>
<h3>The Control Yuan Secretly Reviews Conference Rooms to Strengthen the Exercise of Supervisory Power, Consults the Legislative Yuan to Amend the Relevant Articles on Impeachment Cases to Cooperate with Public Opinion to Sanction Corrupt Officials</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The Control Yuan is seeking to strengthen the exercise of its supervisory power. At the closed-door meeting on the 15th to review work reports, it was resolved to consult the Legislative Yuan to amend Article 13 of the Supervisory Law, which is unreasonable and affects the exercise of impeachment power. The original article stipulated that "Control Yuan personnel shall not disclose impeachment cases to the outside world before the disciplinary authorities have deliberated and disposed of them." According to the provisions of this article, the impeachment cases filed by the Control Yuan in the past could not be announced to the public due to the restrictions of this article, and the impeached corrupt officials who violated laws and regulations did not receive any sanctions from public opinion. When reviewing the past work of the Control Yuan at the meeting on the 15th, the members expressed indignation that the disciplinary authorities had not transferred any of the 45 impeachment cases filed last year for disciplinary action. They believed that according to Article 17 of the Supervisory Law, "If the disciplinary authorities have not handled the impeachment case for more than three months, the Control Yuan may question them," they should be questioned and the heads of the disciplinary authorities should be invited to attend the general meeting to report, and it was advocated that public opinion should be used to sanction corrupt officials in order to cooperate with the exercise of supervisory power. Regarding the amendment of Article 13 of the Supervisory Law, it will be proposed orally by the Supervisory Committee at the joint meeting of the Legislative and Supervisory Committee members on the 20th. After the Supervisory Committee's Regulations Group is established, the amendment will be formally drafted and consulted with the Legislative Yuan for amendment, so as to ensure that impeachment cases are formally announced after review and establishment in the future, so that those who embezzle and pervert the law are subject to sanctions by public opinion. Those who spoke at the meeting on the 15th were very enthusiastic. Liu Pingjiang also advocated that the Disciplinary Committee should be under the command of the Control Yuan. In the afternoon, the organization was passed: (1) the Opinions Collating Group for Business Review, (2) the Regulatory Law Meeting Research Group, and (3) the Political Review Research Group. Each group elected nine members to conduct research.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 15th] Supervisory Committee member Yuan Qinghui stated that the Executive Yuan had not yet implemented the punishment for Song Ziwen and others for套購 Hong Kong dollars. Recently, he sent a special letter to the President urging the Executive Yuan to expedite the handling of the matter, stating in the letter: "National principles must be maintained, and the supervisory powers should be贯澈." He also said: "There are also private individuals who took advantage of the opportunity to 落湯落利from the foreign exchange, which has been verified by the Guangdong and Guangxi Administrative Office and evidence is on file. However, the Administrative Office has been putting it aside for a long time and delaying the handling of the matter, which is very wrong. It is proposed that the Guangdong and Guangxi Administrative Office be ordered to submit the evidence to the Yuan as soon as possible for verification."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The candidates for the Examination Committee and the Grand Justices were previously nominated by the President and requested the approval of the Control Yuan. However, the number of those who agreed was still insufficient to reach the legal quorum. In order for the Examination Committee and the Grand Justices Conference to be held legally, Acting President Li has decided to resubmit several members of the Examination Committee and the Grand Justices and consult the Control Yuan for approval at this year's annual meeting. The heads of the various administrative offices and committees of the Control Yuan will also be re-elected at this year's annual meeting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 15th] Since the opening of the Control Yuan meeting on the 12th, Supervisory Committee members from various regions have arrived in Beijing to report on their duties, including Zhang Yunzhen, Hou Jun, Zhang Xuanzhong, Hu Fuxian, Zhang Jun, Wang Xuan, and Xing Senzhou, a total of seven people.

<h3>British Parliamentarians Question the Whereabouts of the Chongqing Ship</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 14th] During questioning in the British House of Commons today, the issue of the whereabouts of the Chinese cruiser "Chongqing," formerly the British ship "Dawn," was mentioned.

Upon disembarking, his daughter-in-law rushed forward to embrace him warmly, causing Mr. Zhang to blush. He then greeted each of the welcomers individually, and was escorted by Director Yu, Chairman Xue, and others to the Yingbin Hotel for rest. Mr. Zhang told reporters at the airport that he had visited Guangzhou in 1918 and 1927. It had been over a decade since his last visit, so the primary purpose of this trip was to revisit old haunts. Secondly, there were certain political matters in the Southwest that required discussion. He would also take care of some family matters incidentally and would return to Chongqing in a few days. Wu Tiecheng responded to reporters' questions stating: (1) Sun Ke would return to Guangzhou in about a week. (2) Although the cabinet had changed, it would not affect the peace talks. One or two government representatives had resigned, but suitable replacements had already been found. (3) He Yingqin had invited him to participate in [some matter], and he had agreed to help. (4) There was a consensus within the government against stagnation, and naturally a "glorious peace" was desired. (5) The Communist side could propose eight conditions, and we could also propose eight conditions. (6) We cannot guarantee that the Communist army will not cross the Yangtze River, but the government will continue to strive for peace as before.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Rescuing the Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>—The Third of Our Hopes for Premier He—</p>
<p>The cost of living index for workers in this city for the first half of March was released yesterday by the city government, and it is 1339.36 times that of "August 1937." This presents a serious challenge for factories in terms of raising the large amounts of cash needed to pay workers' salaries for the first half of March. We see that many factories today, under the exploitation and torment of high-interest policies and other difficulties, have already been reduced to a desperate situation where they "cannot survive, and cannot close down." Now, they are further threatened by the high cost of living index. If the authorities continue to disregard the consequences, I fear that within one or two months, 70-80% of all factories in Shanghai will declare a shutdown or bankruptcy! If factories close en masse and unemployment rises sharply, such an economic crisis is something we cannot afford to ignore. The situation in Shanghai is likely to affect other places as well.</p>
<p>Before going to Nanjing yesterday, Premier He repeatedly convened meetings with financial giants in this city, expressing that the most difficult issues for the new cabinet, apart from peace talks, were financial and economic problems. We certainly hope that Premier He's new cabinet will have a good plan to rescue the economic crisis.</p>
<p>Our economic crisis did not start today. Its seeds were sown in the later stages of the War of Resistance, but the harm was not yet great. After the victory, policies of dumping gold and official exchange rates were adopted, hoping to stabilize prices during that period, but the nine hundred million US dollars of assets stored in the national treasury were thus wasted. After the foreign exchange rate adopted a floating rate, prices and foreign exchange rates spiraled upwards, like wild horses. Then came the reckless policy of currency reform by Finance Minister Wang Yunwu in the Weng Wenhao cabinet, which took all the gold, silver, and foreign currency stored by the people below the middle class and placed it in the national treasury. "When wealth is gathered by the state, the people are scattered," and the overall situation declined like a river flowing downhill. The biggest shortcoming of past financial and economic policies was that they never made a firm decision to effectively make those who are truly rich pay as much as possible. Until recently, the financial and monetary reform plan presided over by Finance Minister Xu Kan of the Sun Ke cabinet was introduced and made some reforms to reality. While it could not be compared to the measures of Finance Minister Wang, it still lacked the most important link, namely: it did not affect the wealthy in the slightest. As a result, the sweeping measures may instead stifle the livelihoods of ordinary industrial and commercial enterprises and ordinary people.</p>
<p>Let's start with the recent cost of living index. The first half of February rose nearly eight times compared to the second half of January, the second half of February rose nearly double compared to the first half of February, and the first half of March rose more than double again compared to the second half of February. Except for the first half of February, which jumped seven or eight times due to the special Lunar New Year's holiday, the price increase was doubled every half a month. Assuming this speed remains unchanged, the cost of living index will be four times that of the previous month. How can prices not rise sharply? Moreover, in addition to wages, industrial and commercial operators must bear excessively high interest rates. Last week, the average interest rate in the market was six or seven cents per day for call loans, and borrowers had to pay interest on the principal after eight or nine days. If you calculate the cost at this high-interest rate, the price of goods can rise by seven or eight times a month. This will only enrich the wealthy even more, while making it impossible for ordinary industrialists, businessmen, and small operators to maintain their businesses. As for ordinary civil servants and civilians who rely solely on wages, their haggard moans are beyond description!</p>
<p>The current authorities want to use the policy of tightening credit to stabilize prices. However, after the Central Bank used the means of dumping gold, silver, and foreign exchange certificates to tighten credit, the price of gold remained hovering between 3 million and 3.5 million, which dealt a considerable blow to speculators who were only raising the price of gold. But the question remains as to how much this can suppress prices. In all fairness, this kind of dumping policy, from a good perspective, is commendable in the following points: (1) The Central Bank first sells gold, silver, and foreign exchange at high prices, and then buys them back at appropriate low prices, so the Central Bank is not only not harmed but also has a profit to make. The government can be called an invincible big player in the speculative market, and there is no place where it is not profitable. (2) In the past, the price increase was led by financial commodities. Now that the price of financial commodities has been stabilized by seizing the kingpin, the prices of other commodities will not rise day by day. (3) The Shanghai market was originally a speculative market, manipulated by a few major players. These major players are nothing less than vampires sucking the blood of the people. The government should crack down on them to force them to surrender. But on the other hand, there are also many serious problems: (1) This policy is reliable but not sustainable, and it will certainly not prevent price increases. At most, it will only make prices rise in an orderly manner, and the increase of doubling every half a month has almost become a law. (2) Although this policy strikes speculators, it also hurts legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises. The high-interest policy that results from this can make the cost of goods twice as high every half a month, which is enough to abuse legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises. If the factories depreciate and cut off the finished products, the sales are very weak, and even if they are sold, the proceeds are not enough to reproduce. Under such circumstances, in the end, they can only go down the road of "closing the door." (3) If it only rises by one time every half a month, will the price of rice around the Dragon Boat Festival not rise to 19 million per stone? Moreover, if one day the Central Bank cannot control the market, the price increase will run wild and be out of control, and the small people will feel more and more unable to make a living!</p>
<p>From the above discussion, we can see that the most urgent problem facing the new cabinet is how to rescue the economic crisis to reduce the threat to people's lives. The reform plan of the Sun Ke cabinet is still not enough. It must be known that peace talks are important, but if the people in the government-controlled area are all unable to live under the pressure of high prices, high-interest rates, and high wages, will the government still be qualified and capable of talking about equal peace? Peace talks must have capital. Only the stable mood of the people's lives and the psychology of loving and supporting the government are the capital for the government to engage in peace talks. So how can the economic crisis be rescued? This certainly requires the research of some experts, and the most important thing to strive for is to make the wealthy pay. Taking from the wealthy and using it for the common people can win people's hearts and give a fresh look; because only in this way can it be in line with the golden rule of "when wealth is distributed, the people gather." In a nutshell, if the government's economic plans and financial and economic reform plans still refuse to recognize reality and treat this root cause today, it will be in vain.</p>
<h3>The Situation in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Tightens; Seven Columns of the Communist Army in Central China Move South; The National Army in Eastern Hubei Also Completes New Deployments</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] At present, as the 19 columns of Chen Yi's East China Field Army approach the northern bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu and Anhui, about seven columns of the Central Plains Field Army led by Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng, which have completed reorganization after the Battle of Shuangduiji, are advancing from the Yellow River flood area in eastern Henan towards the Xinyang section of the Pinghan Railway and the Macheng-Huangpi area on the northern bank of the Yangtze River east of Wuhan. The 1st Column departed from Xiangcheng and arrived in Guangshan on the 9th. The 1,000-man Xiong Zuofang unit of the 2nd Military Sub-district of the Central Plains also traveled south with this column. The 2nd and 3rd Columns marched towards Gushi from the Fuyang area, accompanied by 2,000 men from the 1st Military Sub-district, led by Lei Shaokang. The 4th Column departed from Taihe, Anhui, and arrived in Huangchuan on the 12th. The 6th Column moved towards Lu'an from Mengcheng. The 9th Column departed from Xiangcheng and arrived in Zhengyang on the 12th. The 11th Column arrived at Xincai from Jieshou and is transporting supplies towards Zhengyang. Based on the observed movements of these seven columns, totaling about 100,000 Communist troops, it is clear that the two Communist armies that arrived in Zhengyang and crossed Huangchuan towards Luoshan aim for Xinyang. The four columns that arrived in Lu'an, Gushi, and Guangshan are likely to cross the tail of the Dabie Mountains and enter the northern bank of the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei to coordinate with Chen Yi's movement near the river bank, forming a posture to cut off the Wu head and Chu tail. Currently, there are only minor skirmishes at the vanguard of the Communist army. The military is paying close attention to its development.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 15th Dispatch] More than 10,000 troops from Liu Bocheng's army, heading south along the Xin (cai) Huang (chuan) highway on the east side of Pinghan, crossed the Houpi River (90 li south of Huangchuan) in Guangshan County on the 14th and arrived in Macheng County, eastern Hubei, only 70 li from the forward positions of the National Army reinforcements in eastern Hubei. (2) The thousand-plus Communist troops on the southern bank of the Huai River between Huangchuan and Luoshan retreated north on the 14th, and order was restored in Luoshan. (3) The Communist army stationed northeast of Zhumadian has been frequently mobilized recently. It is reported that 30,000 National Army troops who surrendered during the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign have been reorganized into a corps under the command of Chen Geng. The unit has three military designations: 12th, 13th, and 14th. Communist cadres account for about two-thirds of the unit. (4) It is reported that two more columns of the Communist army in the southeast will continue to move south. Part of the grain from Guangshan, Huangchuan, Gushi, Xixian, and Shangcheng, the granaries of southern Henan, is being moved south from Xincai. This is another indication of the Communist army's active preparations for crossing the Yangtze River in the middle reaches.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 15th Dispatch] The National Army has completed new deployments on the line of Wuxue, Qichun, and Guangji in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. A powerful corps has arrived in eastern Hubei.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 15th Dispatch] Military News: (1) The National Army has increased its defenses in the eastern part of Henan, and Zhengyang, 90 li east of the isolated county of Zhumadian, has been turned from danger to safety thanks to the arrival of the "3677" unit of the National Army. (2) Chen Geng's newly formed 4th Corps began to move southeast along the Pinghan Road from Luohe via Runan on the 14th. According to a telegram from Luoshan, more than 2,000 Communist troops moving south crossed the Huai River for the second time on the 15th, and the city has strengthened its defenses.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Military News: At 8 PM on the 13th, Communist army small motorboats were discovered towing a small number of wooden boats attempting to navigate the river surface near Heishazhou on the northern bank of the Yangtze River opposite Digang, west of Wuhu. They turned northeast and fled after being fired upon by the garrison on the southern bank.</p>
<h3>Lin Biao's Troops Actively Move South; Large Numbers of Communist Troops Arrive in Jingjiang Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Military personnel who arrived in Qingdao on the 13th stated that when they traveled south from Dezhou on the 8th, they passed by the southward-moving troops of Lin Biao for a depth of about seven to eight kilometers. They counted about 150 mountain guns and 350 field guns. Military news also reported that four columns of Lin Biao's troops—the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th—were moving south between Tengxian and Xuzhou. The weather was clear on the 15th, and air force transport planes and reconnaissance planes discovered Communist army troops moving south on the Siying, Sishui, Jieshou, and Gaoyou highway lines in northern Jiangsu, numbering over 10,000. As Chen Yi's troops have already approached the northern banks of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu and Anhui, the above-mentioned marching troops are undoubtedly the Communist side's second-line reinforcements.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 15th Dispatch] The 10th, 12th, and 13th Columns of the Communist army have arrived in Jingjiang, increasing the pressure on the National Army's positions at Bawugang, but there has been no contact.

<h3>Taiwan Province Plans to Experiment with British-Style Socialism</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 15th Dispatch] Taiwan has experimented with Japanese and American administrative systems in the three years since its restoration. Since Chen Cheng took over the provincial administration of Taiwan, he has also planned to use the province as a place to experiment with the British-style socialist system. Mr. Chen is currently planning to implement the British full rationing system in Taiwan and has recruited many scholars who have returned from studying in the UK to plan this matter for the Taiwan Provincial Government. Mr. Chen himself admires British socialism very much and has written books on socialism. The success or failure of Mr. Chen's socialist administration in Taiwan depends on whether he can enable Taiwan Province to directly engage in foreign trade. Currently, the foreign trade of various provinces is handled by the central authorities, and what Taiwan gets is not foreign exchange but gold yuan. In addition, whether the local residents can cooperate with Mr. Chen is also the main factor for the success of the experimental socialist system. Taiwan was ruled by Japan for fifty years. After the restoration, the Chinese authorities supported the war at home with Taiwan's resources. At the beginning of Chen Yi's term, he took over the major industries and monopoly enterprises in Taiwan Province and put people from other provinces in charge of the institutions, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the Taiwanese people. After Wei Daoming took office, he implemented the American system and contacted the prestigious people of Taiwan Province to use them as intermediaries between the government and the Taiwanese people. However, these wealthy Taiwanese households also had little contact with the people and took advantage of their relationship with Mr. Wei to pursue their own personal interests. Until January of this year, due to the dramatic changes in the domestic situation, the central government appointed Chen Cheng as the chairman of Taiwan Province. How effective Mr. Chen's promotion of socialism will be remains to be proven by facts.</p>

Li also emphasized that due to the expansion of communism in Southeast Asia, it is necessary to strengthen defense arrangements in the Pacific. It is noted that Li is here as a special envoy of Prime Minister Attlee to discuss various issues related to the British Commonwealth with the Australian and New Zealand governments.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] Sources close to the British Foreign Office claim that rumors about the start of talks on a Pacific Pact are premature. According to semi-official British views, discussions on a Pacific Pact can only begin after the Atlantic Pact has been finalized. Those close to British Foreign Secretary Bevin are increasingly aware that it is now imperative to organize strong democratic powers in the Far East and pay attention to their policies in order to align with the Western powers' concern for maintaining peace in that part of the world. It will still take time to address any developments in these countries using established methods.</p>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 15th] Political figures here stated that it is too early to discuss a Pacific regional defense pact until the political difficulties in Indonesia are resolved. To date, the Dutch government has not received any official information regarding the establishment of such a defense pact.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 15th] The conference of foreign ministers of the five Western European allies entered its second day today, continuing discussions on the North Atlantic Joint Defense Treaty and the charter of the European Consultative Assembly. Because the five countries, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, have invited Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, and Italy to attend the inaugural meeting of the European Consultative Assembly to be held in London on the 28th of this month, and the foreign ministers of the five countries also intend to go to Washington to participate in the signing ceremony of the North Atlantic Treaty, a conflict arises in terms of time. It is expected that the meeting of the foreign ministers of the five countries will inevitably decide to postpone the London meeting or have the ambassadors of each country represent the foreign ministers. The details of the meetings of the past two days are being kept strictly confidential by the authorities and will only be announced after the conclusion, but most of the resolutions related to joint defense are not included in this case, and only the economic issues caused by the North Atlantic Treaty will be announced.</p>

<h3>Closing of the Supreme Soviet Assembly; Continued Changes in Government Personnel; Dismissal of the Chairman of the State Planning Committee Worthy of Attention</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 14th] The Supreme Soviet Assembly passed the general budget for this year tonight, stipulating defense spending of 79 billion rubles, and then announced its closure.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 14th] Three Soviet government officials were dismissed today by order of the Supreme Soviet. One was Nikolai Voznesensky, Chairman of the State Planning Committee and Deputy Prime Minister, whose vacancy was filled by Deputy Prime Minister Saburov. In addition, Supreme Court President Golyakov was also dismissed and replaced by Volin. Finally, Bobokov, a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, was dismissed and replaced by Mikhailovich.</p>
<p>It is noted that Voznesensky first emerged after the purges of Soviet defendants before the war. When he served in the Leningrad Planning Committee in 1934, he may have been a confidant of Soviet Communist Party figure Zhdanov.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 14th] Although the reasons for the personnel changes in the Soviet Cabinet were not explained, they are clearly part of a comprehensive reorganization plan for the government. In addition, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet announced the merging of the Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Construction, Naval Enterprises, and the Ministry of Machine Industry into the Ministry of Construction and Machine Industry, headed by Taigayev, the former Minister of Construction.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] Observers here believe that the dismissal of Voznesensky, Chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee, may indicate that Soviet leaders are reconsidering the ideological basis of Soviet foreign policy. Whether this speculation is correct can be determined by whether Voznesensky still retains his position as a member of the Communist Party Politburo. Observers here also point out that when Molotov and Mikoyan were dismissed from their positions as Foreign Minister and Minister of Foreign Trade, respectively, at the beginning of the month, they still retained their positions as Deputy Prime Ministers, but Voznesensky is not the same; even the position of Deputy Prime Minister has been removed. However, his position as a member of the Politburo may be retained. If so, his dismissal as Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Planning Committee may mean that he will focus on the work of the Eastern European Economic Assistance Committee. One theory is that Voznesensky's dismissal as Chairman of the State Planning Committee is due to the fact that Soviet leaders' ideological beliefs about their relations with Western countries have been shaken. Over the past year, after the famous Soviet economist Varga published a new theory that Western countries may achieve socio-economic liberation through reform rather than revolution, it caused controversy among Soviet leaders. Voznesensky was one of the most vocal opponents of Varga's views, so this time Voznesensky's dismissal may indicate that Soviet leaders have begun to re-examine the ideology on which their foreign policy is based.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 15th Broadcast: Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker visited Bevin today to discuss the Indonesian issue. Bevin earnestly urged the Dutch to immediately release the arrested Indonesian leaders and allow the Republic of Indonesia to be fully independent. Bevin told the Dutch Foreign Minister: The Netherlands' willingness to transfer power to the Republican government on May 1 is a wise move, but if the Republican leaders are still detained, the gesture of transferring power cannot be guaranteed to have an effect among the Indonesian people. Diplomatic figures here also said that if the Republic cannot resume its operations in Yogyakarta, the round-table conference proposed by the Netherlands is unlikely to achieve anything. It is noted that the Dutch Foreign Minister is in England to attend the meeting of foreign ministers of the Western European Union countries.</p>

It has recently requested the Post-War Rehabilitation Affairs Committee to submit a report to the Executive Yuan for immediate prohibition. According to the committee, at the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), it was responsible for taking custody of a portion of the remaining materials to continue promoting the unfinished post-war rehabilitation affairs. According to the agreement signed between UNRRA and the Chinese government at that time, these materials were donated by UNRRA specifically for post-war rehabilitation purposes and must not be transferred for military use. In recent weeks, the Fishery Management Office's warehouse under the committee has had 1,589,219 board feet of yellow pine requisitioned. These wood materials have been designated by the Fishery Materials Allocation Committee for distribution to fishermen in coastal provinces for repairing wooden boats. Furthermore, the China Agricultural Machinery Company has also had 4,500 cubic yards of yellow sand and 7,973 cubic yards of gravel requisitioned. This matter not only affects the advancement of post-war rehabilitation affairs but also may cause international misunderstandings. Therefore, the committee hopes that relevant authorities will instruct their subordinates to pay attention.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Jianghai Customs officially began using "Customs Gold Units" as the unit of tax calculation yesterday. One "Customs Gold Unit" is equivalent to 40 cents in US currency. The ratio between it and gold yuan coupons will be stipulated daily by the Central Bank. Yesterday, one "Customs Gold Unit" was equivalent to 2,164 yuan in gold yuan coupons.

After importers declare customs and obtain a tax payment certificate, they can pay the assessed tax amount to the Tax Collection Department of the Central Bank. If they have a Customs Gold Unit account opened in the national bank, they can use Customs Gold Unit checks to pay. Otherwise, they can convert it into gold yuan at the conversion rate of Customs Gold Units to gold yuan on the date of tax payment and pay it. It was also stated that declaration forms submitted the day before yesterday (the 14th) but not taxed on the same day will still be taxed in gold yuan.</p>

<h3>Upper Period Worker Living Index for This Month Announced by Review Committee - Over 1339 Times</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The worker's cost of living index for the upper period of this month in this city has been released by the city government. The fixed base period index is 1339.3552 times, and the chain relative index is 2.08 times. The Shanghai Municipal Worker's Cost of Living Index Compilation Review Committee held a meeting yesterday morning, chaired by Chu Yifei, the statistical director of the city government. Cao Peizi, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Shen Ding, Ju Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, Liang Yongzhang, Sun Wenyuan, Yan Esheng of the City Chamber of Commerce, Jin Runxiang of the Industrial Association, Tian Heqing, and others attended. First, the chairman reported that a total of five surveys were conducted for this period. General price fluctuations were minimal in the first three surveys, and the index was not much different from the previous period's index. Fluctuations only occurred in the last two periods. Therefore, the total average of the worker's cost of living index for this period increased by more than one time compared to the previous period. Finally, the members signed the index form, which was then announced. The total worker's cost of living index for the upper period of March is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Fixed Base Period Index" Taking the upper half of January of the 38th year of the Republic (48.04 times) as the base period, the total index and classification index are as follows:</p>
<p>Total Index: 27.88</p>
<p>Classification Index: Food Category 29.98</p>
<p>Clothing Category 21.18</p>
<p>Water, Electricity, Fuel, and Housing Category 25.13</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Category 25.71</p>
<p>(2) "Chain Relative Index" (i.e., comparison of this period to the previous period). The total index and classification index are as follows:</p>
<p>Total Index: 2.08</p>
<p>Classification Index: Food Category 2.10</p>
<p>Clothing Category 2.10</p>
<p>Water, Electricity, Fuel, and Housing Category 2.03</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Category 2.01</p>
<h3>Two Proposals from the General Labor Union Sparked Debate in the Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The living index for this period was delayed until 12:45 yesterday before being released by the city government, more than two hours later than usual. Moreover, the released index of 1339 times was lower than generally expected, which aroused suspicion from all walks of life, and various rumors followed. At around 11:00, it was once rumored that the index had been determined to be 1642 times. Some factories and firms, without careful consideration, actually paid wages based on 1642 times. In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited relevant people to inquire about the situation in the index review committee and the source of the "1642" rumor. It is understood that yesterday's meeting began at 10:30. First, Chu Yifei, the statistical director of the city government, reported the calculation results of the chain relative index and the fixed index. The old index was 1336 times, while the new calculation by the City General Labor Union was 1339 times (also based on the city government's compilation formula). The two were not much different. Zhou Xuexiang, chairman of the General Labor Union, believed that prices are rising in an orderly manner every day, and the increase in half a month is more than one time. It is impossible for the working class to use the average price in this half month to cope with the current real life. Therefore, he put forward two suggestions: (1) The current index compilation surveys prices five times. The first time is on the first day of the period. At that time, the price was not much different from the last price in the previous period's index. If added to the calculation, it would have a great impact on the index and should be cancelled, and only the average of the subsequent four times should be calculated. (2) The rice price in the index should be calculated entirely based on the market price (currently, the compilation is based on half the market price and half the ration price). However, these two suggestions were immediately opposed by representatives of the industrial sector, which sparked a heated debate between the two sides. Although the city government favored 1339 times, representatives of the General Labor Union still refused to sign, and the situation was deadlocked for a long time. Because if Zhou Xuexiang's two proposals could be adopted, the index for this period would be more than 1500 times, which is more than 200 times different from what was released yesterday. Later, after repeated explanations by Cao, the director of the City Social Affairs Bureau, and the promise that the index compilation method for the next period could be discussed at length, he strongly persuaded the representatives of the General Labor Union to sign. This "1339" index was then born. The rumor of "1642" is the index proposed by the General Labor Union, which the General Labor Union strongly denied, but said: "I have also heard this saying, but I don't know where it came from."</p>
<h3>Police Department's Handling of Labor Disputes - General Labor Union Believes It Is Unfair</h3>
<p>Zhou Xuexiang and Others to Petition Today</p>
<p>The City General Labor Union believes that the provision in the various measures for handling labor disputes recently promulgated by the Garrison Headquarters, which stipulates that union directors and officers are jointly responsible for the occurrence of labor disputes, is unfair. Furthermore, since the sealing of steel smelting products, more than 8,000 workers have been cut off from their livelihoods. In order to seek relief from the authorities, Chairman Zhou Xuexiang will lead the directors and supervisors to the City Government, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and the Social Affairs Bureau to petition at 10:00 AM today.</p>
<h3>Yu Wenhua, an Employee of the Police Pictorial Office, is Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yu Wenhua, who forged the seal of the Police Pictorial Office and falsely collected advertising fees, was sentenced to two months of imprisonment by the District Court yesterday, with a fine of 100 yuan. If he chooses to perform labor service, it will be calculated at 3 yuan per day. It is reported that on July 16th of last year, Yu was hired by Luo Zhenzi, the president of the Nanjing Police Pictorial Office, as the director of the advertising department of the Shanghai branch. It was agreed that all documents required for advertising business should be signed by Luo for supervision. However, on October 27th of last year, Yu privately carved two seals of the office and forged the office's receipts, receiving a total of 300 yuan in advertising fees paid by the American-owned Jijiang Tobacco Company. Also, when settling accounts with Luo on the 27th of the same month, he issued a blank check. Luo was unable to cash the check and investigated the previous situation, so he reported it to the police, who transferred it to the District Court for trial and sentencing.</p>
<h3>Sudden Threatening Letter - Businessman Seeks Protection - Famous "Thin Knife Gang" Arrested on Kangti Road</h3>

<h3>Moving to a New Home, Colleagues Enjoy a Banquet - Missing Gun After Waking Up - Deputy Manager of Feilun Thread Factory - Bizarre Case of Drug Poisoning - Concubine Claims Suicide, Suspected of Detention</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Wang Yaozeng, 42 years old, from Shangyu, Zhejiang, the deputy manager of the China Feilun Thread Factory Co., Ltd. on Nanjing Road, has one wife and one concubine. The concubine, Peng Meiying, 25 years old, from Nantong, is "Bai Ping," who used to be a dancer at the Gao Shimang Dance Hall. As early as seven years ago, Wang ventured into the dance hall, fell in love at first sight, and soon discussed marriage, keeping her as a mistress. Initially, they lived with the main wife at No. 11, Zhaojia Zhai, Damuqiao, Nanshi. Recently, they moved to No. 62, Wanyi Fang, Chongqing South Road. On the 12th, Lu Liqun, the general manager of the company, hosted a banquet at Wang's home to invite colleagues to celebrate. After the banquet, Wang stayed overnight at his concubine's place. Wang is currently an auxiliary police officer in the Changshu Road Police Bureau's volunteer police force and has a self-defense pistol and a car for transportation. The next morning, after Wang got up to use the toilet, he suddenly found that his self-prepared pistol was missing. He asked his concubine urgently, and Peng brought out a handful of pills, instructing him to take them, saying that the gun would be returned after taking them. Wang was suffering from a toothache at the time and did not suspect anything. However, after taking them, he felt dizzy and confused. He immediately called the second landlord, Mr. Huang, to the scene, saying that if he was poisoned to death, please testify, etc. He was then rushed to Nanyang Hospital for treatment in Wang's car, and it was reported that he was fine. Afterwards, the hospital reported the information to the Songshan Road Police Precinct. Song Tingjun, the director of the precinct, instructed Section Chief Zhong to send personnel to summon Wang Yaozeng and his concubine Peng Meiying for questioning. According to her statement, she has been living with Wang for seven years and has three children. Their relationship is usually good. A few days ago, a friend of Wang borrowed 20 silver dollars, which were returned to her. Wang asked her for them, but because she wanted to make new clothes, she did not return them, and a quarrel broke out. On the morning of the 13th, he wanted to use his self-prepared pistol to kill her, so she took the opportunity to hide the gun. He could not find the gun and secretly took sleeping pills to commit suicide. After finding something wrong with his expression, she sent him to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. She knew nothing else. Later, she replied to the interrogating officer, saying that she often went to her husband's friend Yuan Pu's house to play, but there was no ambiguity. After Yuan was summoned to the bureau for questioning, he said that he was a friend of Wang Yaozeng, and Wang's concubine Peng often came to his house to play, but there was no relationship. He also did not know about the quarrel between Wang and Peng. The precinct believes that the case is confusing and there must be hidden circumstances. In addition to temporarily detaining Peng Meiying, it will investigate whether there is any suspicion of coercing suicide and then transfer it to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial.</p>

<h3>Famous Throughout Shanghai Twenty Years Ago - Now Even Housing and Food are Problems - Wang Hanlun Sighs to the Heavens</h3>
<p>Housing Dispute with Zhou Xiang-sheng - Petitioning Mayor Wu for Relief</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Wang Hanlun, the tragic star who was famous in the film industry 20 years ago under the name "Little Widow", has recently been forced to move by her landlord Zhou Xiang-sheng. Because she is unable to move elsewhere, she has personally submitted a petition to Mayor Wu requesting relief. The city government has transferred the matter to the Land Affairs Bureau, which summoned both parties a few days ago without any result. It is now scheduled to convene both parties again on the 19th to conduct mediation.</p>
<p>Wang's residence is at No. 19, Lane 918, Linsen Middle Road, which was originally Xiang-sheng Apartments operated by Zhou Xiang-sheng. Starting last year, Zhou wanted to take back the house and give it to his concubine, surnamed Wang, so he took action to move her out. Wang's residence is only a pavilion room, less than ten feet wide. The interior is even more messy. According to her, she has lived here for six years. In the past six years, she has worked as a beautician at the Shanghai River Beauty Salon to make a living and has long been separated from the film industry. This aging star often sighs when talking about the past, saying that the past is like a dream and she really feels unbearable to look back.</p>
<p>Wang entered the film industry as early as before the 16th year of the Republic, becoming famous throughout Shanghai with the film "The Orphan Saves His Grandfather". Because the various tragic films she starred in, such as "Yu Li's Soul" and "Spring Boudoir Dream", sold very well in Southeast Asia, the largest Star Film Company at the time relied on her as a pillar. She later married Wang Jihuan, a famous person from Hangzhou, but they divorced after only living together for 100 days due to incompatible personalities. Before the War of Resistance, she spent her own money to establish Hanlun Film Company, shooting two sound films, "Blind Love" and "Red Flower Vase". When Shanghai fell, the enemy forced her to serve as a propagandist at the pseudo "Greater China Radio Station", which Wang婉 refused. She then officially left her screen career and lived in seclusion under a pseudonym. Over the years, her savings have been almost exhausted, and her income from beauty work is minimal, so she often cannot afford three meals a day. Her haggard appearance is evident in her struggle to make a living.</p>
<p>She expressed that she does not want to ask for help from the film industry or any better-off younger stars in this housing dispute, because she feels that she has been treated with coldness and forgotten by them in recent years. She said that Bao Tianxiao had worked with her for a long time in the past, and she recently planned to ask Bao to write a script for her to perform in a drama, but she is worried about the fickleness of the world, the decline of her appearance, and that she will not be welcomed by the audience.</p>

<h3>The Essence of English Grammar: Widely Adopted by Schools</h3>

<h3>Foreign Ships Sailing in Our Ports: National Shipping Association Opposes</h3>
<p>The National Shipping Industry Association issued a declaration yesterday opposing foreign ships sailing directly from ports close to war zones to other ports in our country. It stated briefly: Recently, the British Embassy in China has again requested our government to grant special permission for foreign ships to transport supplies directly from ports close to war zones to other ports in our country. In other words, it is requesting the opening of coastal navigation rights, with the intention of regaining navigation rights, which is clearly revealed. The integrity of navigation rights is where the life of the nation lies, and we cannot allow them to be lost again. The two orders issued by former Executive Yuan President Sun, opening coastal and inland river navigation rights, run counter to the national policy of safeguarding sovereignty and should be abolished immediately. If foreign merchant ships disregard our public opinion and blatantly infringe upon our navigation rights, we will resist at any cost to maintain the last chance for our national shipping industry.</p>

According to a spokesperson for the Railway Administration yesterday, the Police Department has already submitted a document to the District Court, stating the details of the entire case and filing a counterclaim, briefly stating: There is a small iron-roofed house next to the North Cargo Station of the Railway Administration, which was originally borrowed by the North General Station and temporarily used by the Police Section as a detention center for criminals. Lu Zhenjiang borrowed it last autumn to use as his residence temporarily. Later, Lu was dismissed from his post for some reason and soon passed away. Afterwards, the situation became tense, and the Xihu Police Section concentrated the police officers in one place and needed housing. Since Lu had left his post long ago, his family was notified to move out. Since the Police Section urgently needed the house, it was reported to the Police Department for approval, and Inspector Wang Du was dispatched to take back the house, along with a list of the furniture and objects stored inside for collection. Many days later, a man named Lu Yaomin, claiming to be Lu's nephew, came to the section and claimed that a suit and two ties were missing and demanded compensation before he would move out. The section stated that there were no suits or ties on the list and did not accept the claim. Later, Lu's wife came to collect the stored items. Recently, Lu Yaomin suddenly filed a lawsuit with the District Court, accusing Liu Yao, Wang Du, Yang Jian (who handed over the items to Lu's wife), and two others. The Railway Police authorities believe that Lu Yaomin is suspected of intentional defamation and have filed a counterclaim.</p>
<h3>"Thin Knife Gang" Celebrates Birthday: More Than a Dozen Arrested, "Little Foreigner" Sent to the District Attorney's Office</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Wang Guoliang, a well-known member of the "Thin Knife Gang," used the name of his ancestor to celebrate his 80th posthumous birthday at the Xiexing Restaurant on Taiping Bridge, Shunchang Road, at 4:00 PM on the 14th, and issued birthday invitations indiscriminately. Someone secretly reported this to the Songshan Police Sub-bureau. Inspector Guo led a large number of police officers to rush to the scene and found the upstairs bustling with activity. The police officers rushed in and arrested Wang Jucheng, Yin Anguo, Huang Zhiming, Xu Genshi, and twelve others on the spot. They also found a thin-bladed knife on Yin Anguo's body, 1,500 gold yuan on the account table, a guest book, and a large bundle of invitations and thank-you notes, which were all taken to the bureau. It was found that Wang Guoliang, the principal in the case, was on the run, and Wang Jucheng was responsible for presiding over everything on the scene. Among them, Huang Zhiming (nickname "Little Foreigner") had robbed Du Faliang of ten silver yuan near the Xieqiao Bridge in the Manufacturing Bureau.

<h3>Beiping Style (4)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xue</p>
<p>(Report on a city before and after the "Partial Peace")</p>
<p>Mao Zedong pointed out in "On Coalition Government" that the current revolutionary movement in China is still in the stage of New Democracy. Only by transitioning from the stage of New Democracy to Socialism can Communism be realized. A coalition government is a political form for implementing New Democracy, a temporary transitional government. Once the stage of Socialism is entered, it will be a political form of proletarian dictatorship. In order to adapt to China's national conditions, Mao Zedong revised the development of the Communist revolution into two stages: New Democracy and Socialism. The content of New Democracy is the genuine implementation of the Three Principles of the People, largely similar but slightly different. The political line currently adopted by the Communist Party in the cities is naturally a form of coalition government under the leadership of the Communist Party, which can better obtain good responses in various aspects.</p>
<p>Another issue is the relationship between the CCP and the Soviet Union. After the retreat from Changchun and Shenyang, people from the Northeast living in Beiping often brought information about the situation after the Soviet army entered the Northeast, such as Soviet soldiers raping women, so that people in Shenyang with girls over the age of sixteen at home tried to find an object and marry them off hastily to avoid problems. Many of the families of Communist army cadres were also raped, causing resentment. Even female Soviet soldiers raped men, because their bodies were too strong! A captured National Army soldier, during training in Harbin, debated a question with a Communist army instructor. He (the National Army soldier) said: "You say that the United States is imperialism, and we should overthrow it, and I agree. But the United States is imperialism, and it sends us many relief supplies without any cost to help our people. The Soviet Union is our friendly neighbor, but it has taken many of our Northeast materials and machines to the Soviet Union. How do you explain this?" The instructor could not answer and said, "You are right, I cannot answer this question. I will ask a higher-level instructor to answer you." Later, the higher-level instructor came, but he did not answer the question either. He only said, "Let's all eat now, no more discussion."</p>
<p>During the Beiping peace talks, a friend of the author, representing a certain party, met with the Communist army outside the city. In addition to negotiating the task itself, he also discussed many theoretical issues with a political commissar under Ye Jianying. The friend asked what the relationship between the CCP and the Soviet Union was. The comrade's answer was very clever! He said: "The CCP is completely centered on Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is a person who is based in China. All political decisions and revisions are based on adapting to China's national conditions, such as New Democracy, which was proposed based on China's national conditions. As for what kind of relationship Chairman Mao has with the Soviet Union, we do not ask." Still, no answer was obtained.</p>
<p>Although there were also Soviet advisors directing operations in the People's Liberation Army attacking Pingjin, what exactly is the relationship between the CCP and the Soviet Union? The author cannot explain it concretely here.</p>
<p>(4) The Press in Beiping after Peace</p>
<p>In the past, there were more than twenty newspapers, large and small, in the Beiping press. Except for a very small number that were publicly operated, most were privately operated. Because people's purchasing power was weak and the circulation was small, it was very difficult for many newspapers to be self-sufficient, except for the disguised subsidies of allocated paper. After Beiping was surrounded, people needed to know the development of the war, and everyone bought a newspaper, and selling newspapers became a popular profession. After the realization of partial peace, because the agreement stipulated that the original newspapers would be published as usual and then apply for examination and registration later, even the Kuomintang newspaper, the North China Daily, which was most strongly anti-Communist, continued to be published without ceasing publication. It's just that the president had already slipped away to Nanjing.</p>
<p>After the Communist army entered the city, their main focus was on propaganda work. First, they took over the North China Daily and renamed it People's Daily, Beiping Radio Station was renamed Xinhua Radio, and the Central News Agency was renamed Xinhua News Agency. They began to undertake the propaganda tasks assigned to them by the Party.</p>
<p>The People's Daily started publishing after one day of preparation. It was a full-sized newspaper, priced at 2 yuan in People's Currency per copy. The content appeared entirely in the form of a Party newspaper. Lengthy propaganda texts filled the pages, and all the broadcast material from Xinhua News Agency was also published. A special dispatch was always over a thousand characters long, but there were very few ordinary news items. Their style of arrangement and writing was different from the original Beiping newspapers. Its characteristics are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary newspapers are edited in the evening and published before six o'clock in the morning; while the People's Daily is edited in the morning and published at noon, one or two o'clock.</p>
<p>(2) Ordinary newspapers focus on news reports and social news; while the People's Daily is the opposite, and there is not even a single social news item.</p>
<p>(3) Ordinary newspapers focus on advertising and economic quotations; while the People's Daily did not originally publish any advertisements or economic quotations. Later, due to practical needs, it selectively published a few columns of advertisements and economic news.</p>
<p>(4) Ordinary newspapers are mostly sold in the city of Beiping and on the main lines of several railways; while the People's Daily, in addition to selling a part in Beiping, is mostly sent to government staff at all levels in the liberated areas and to the armed forces for reading as propaganda.</p>
<p>(5) The original price of newspapers in Beiping was 30 yuan in gold yuan for those in a quarter sheet, and 20 yuan for those in an eighth sheet; while the People's Daily, a full sheet, was only sold for 2 yuan in People's Currency, equivalent to 20 yuan in gold yuan. The price was particularly low. Some colleagues suggested that it raise its price, but it said that this was a decision of the Party and could not be changed arbitrarily, and it was not subject to the restrictions of the industry association.</p>
<p>The employees of the People's Daily, except for the personnel of the editorial and interview departments, were all retained, as well as the distribution, management, and printing workers. The current printing volume of the People's Daily is 60,000 to 70,000 copies, which is two to three times more than the North China Daily.</p>
<p>In addition to the People's Daily being the CCP's Party newspaper, the remaining privately-operated newspapers adopted a policy of self-reliance to avoid the crime of controlling public opinion. First, the source of news was blocked, so that you could not obtain a single item of news, and yellow social news was also difficult to publish. The Xinhua News Agency's correspondence was only supplied to newspapers that had been examined and registered. News agencies that had not been examined and registered had difficulty with news sources because there was no correspondence. Furthermore, even if you received Xinhua News Agency's broadcasts yourself, they were all the same, largely similar. People would of course prefer to buy a full sheet of paper rather than an eighth sheet of paper for the same price. Moreover, the People's Daily published the People's Government's announcements, which had to be read. As a result, newspapers that had sold tens of thousands of copies in the past fell to one or two thousand copies, or even only a few hundred copies. With a sharp decline in sales and no income, they were of course unable to maintain operations and had to cease publication on their own. Many privately-operated newspapers in Beiping ceased publication for this reason.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, the circulation of privately-operated newspapers such as the World Daily actually increased. There are several reasons for this: First, the newspaper had some special dispatches from Nanjing and Guangzhou, and everyone hoped to know some news from the South after the general isolation of information. Second, after other privately-operated newspapers ceased publication, they naturally ceded some readers to the World Daily. Third, the World Daily has a longer history, and the people of Beiping have a deeper impression of it. The increase in circulation and the possession of a large readership was certainly a happy event for the World Daily; but at the same time, it also attracted the jealousy and hatred of the CCP, and the main reason for the later seizure under the charge of being part of the CC clique. The CCP is unwilling to report unfavorable true news in its occupied areas, and it is also unwilling to have a third-party position. The existence of newspapers with wide circulation is a great spiritual threat to them! The World Daily is a privately-operated newspaper, and its circulation is relatively large, so they certainly did not want it to exist, but they had to find a plausible reason to do so, otherwise it would conflict with their own propaganda policy. Therefore, they added the charge of being part of the CC clique to Cheng Shewo, which was actually a great injustice! In the past, the World Daily had adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the CCP, leaving room for maneuver. Their headlines always referred to the CCP as "remnant Communists," and never labeled them as "Communist bandits." Their criticisms of many government measures were very sharp and greatly dissatisfied with corrupt politics. In the political environment at the time, this was already very difficult! As for the many minor points listed by the CCP, they were unavoidable minor phenomena in the large environment at the time, and they were not enough to prove that Cheng Shewo was a member of the CC clique. After the peace in Beiping, the World Daily's remarks were even more in line with the People's Daily, and it worked very hard! It is true that "if one is determined to condemn someone, one can always find a pretext!" The seizure of the World Daily shows that the CCP does not allow true freedom of speech, and it has torn off its own democratic mask.</p>
<p>In addition to the policy of self-reliance, the CCP's policy towards privately-operated newspapers in Beiping was to either allow or secretly encourage the newspaper's employees to liquidate and struggle against the management, causing them to harm each other and move towards destruction together. Similar liquidation events occurred in almost all newspaper offices, claiming that the management had exploited them in the past and that they must be compensated. Even newspapers that were losing money every month were no exception. The New People's Daily, because it had more pro-CCP elements within it, announced its independence in another way, breaking away from the head office and forcing the original manager to resign. Under the control of the CCP, it was jointly operated by the employees to accompany the CCP's guarantee of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>After the realization of partial peace in the Beiping press, the content of the newspapers was originally cautious due to the change of environment. Hoping to retain the opportunity to apply for registration, they all looked to the People's Daily, but the Xinhua News Agency's broadcast news was all the same, with no news value and no need to read it! However, the World Daily Evening News was still seized, the New People's Daily declared independence, and many other privately-operated newspapers ceased publication one after another. Currently, the People's Daily dominates the scene alone, in a state of desolation!</p>
<p>Ji Ang and Musa sent several telegrams in succession, causing dissatisfaction among the CCP. Therefore, based on the meaning of military control, the Beiping Military Control Commission directly notified all foreign reporters and news agencies stationed in Beiping to stop their activities. True reporting is not needed in the CCP's areas! Not only is news reporting not free, but also the personnel sent from outside are under protection and surveillance, and they try their best to avoid contact with the society, so that they cannot understand the true situation. Mythical legends were discovered in Shanghai newspapers. The CCP is very realistic. In order to consolidate its rule, it can discard the false mask of democracy at any time under various explanations, unlike the Kuomintang's bureaucratic style, which is hesitant and scrupulous.</p>
<p>The democratic style and freedom of speech advocated by the CCP are strongly fought for in the Kuomintang areas. But in the CCP's occupied areas, it is not very applicable. The phenomenon manifested by the Beiping press after liberation can provide full proof. But then again, Beiping has after all realized partial peace, and all measures seem to be relatively enlightened and progressive. In addition to the People's Daily, it can still allow one or two privately-operated newspapers controlled by the CCP to exist. And Tianjin only has one Tianjin Daily, and Jinan only has one New Democracy Daily. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Officers Gang Up to Rob: Security Chief Flees to Wuxi. Crime in Nanjing, Net Lands Inside Car.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi, 14th Dispatch] Ding Jizhi, from Xuzhou, a certain security regiment commander. When the KMT and Communist armies were at the Xuzhou conference, the security regiment he led was also defeated by the Communist army. Mr. Xu then led several close confidants, carrying several short guns, and fled to Wuxi, residing in Zhongqiao Town 25 Bao 3 Jia 4 Hu, a countryside in this county. In recent months, prices have soared, and life is becoming increasingly difficult, so he and his companions joined in a life of robbery, but the target of the robbery was the county near our county. The way of robbery was to take a car to other ports in the morning to commit the crime, and then return to Wuxi in the evening, so although he had done it many times, the case was never solved, and recently he was arrested in Nanjing due to a secret opportunity.</p>
<p>Ding, with his companions Zhang Chuncun, and another Mr. Zhang, carried a machine gun and took a car to Nanjing on the 11th of this month. That night, they robbed Wang Zhenzhong's house at No. 110 Shigu Road and snatched two gold bars. The three fled separately. However, after the case occurred, the police bureau in charge blocked all traffic arteries and searched, and Zhang Chuncun was captured at Jinyin Lane and one gold bar was found on his body, so he was taken back to the police bureau for questioning, and confessed the shape of Xu and other criminals. Zheng Secretary of the Criminal Police Team, and Ba Deputy Team Leader, led three officers, and together with two patrol officers from the police bureau, immediately went to Xiaguan to search. At 11:00, they took the night train to Wuxi, but when the train arrived at Zhenjiang Station, they found that one person had the same clothes and appearance as Zhang bandit confessed. Because the man put his hands in his arms, he did not take rash action. He then shot the man under the pretext of checking tickets. A machine gun was found on his body. He was indeed the main offender, Ding Jizhi. He was escorted back to Beijing. According to the confession, Mr. Zhang has already returned to Wuxi. The police bureau sent someone to Wuxi yesterday morning to meet with Li Inspector of the local police bureau, etc. However, Mr. Zhang was no longer there, and only a Cao was captured. A suspect surnamed Fan also took a car back to Beijing this morning for investigation and handling.</p>

The staff of the store took out a pure gold bracelet of one tael, five qian, and two fen for him to look at. The soldier thought the style was not to his liking, so he asked for another one to be picked. The shop did not suspect him of anything else.

<h3>Remittance and Cash Transport between Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangdong: Ministry of Finance Re-regulates Limits: Daily Remittances Not to Exceed 20 Million: Cash Transport to Guangdong Limited to 200,000 Per Person</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the limits on remittances and cash transport between Shanghai and Wuhan, the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau, following the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, has re-regulated as follows: The total amount of remittances from Shanghai and Wuhan to Guangdong shall not exceed 20 million yuan per day, and each remittance shall not exceed 200,000 yuan. The total amount of inward remittances paid by various banks and firms in Guangzhou each day shall not exceed 60 million yuan. Furthermore, the amount of cash that individuals may carry to Guangdong shall not exceed 200,000 yuan. Amounts exceeding the limit shall be deposited with the Central Bank for three months before being returned. For government agencies and industrial and commercial enterprises that must remit amounts exceeding the limit or carry cash exceeding the limit for normal purposes, they shall provide proof and submit it to the local Financial Control Bureau for approval. A certificate will be issued, and remittances or cash may be carried based on the certificate, without being subject to the above rules. In areas without a Financial Control Bureau, applications should be made to the local or nearby Central Bank branch. The Shanghai Financial Control Bureau has issued orders to the banking, money, trust, and insurance associations in the city and instructed them to comply.</p>
<p>In addition, the Jianghai Customs also issued a similar announcement yesterday, which has been implemented since yesterday.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Recently, the phenomenon of capital flowing south has become rampant again. In the past four days, the amount of gold allocation coupons flowing to Guangzhou is estimated by banking and money circles to be as high as 2.5 billion. As a result, there is currently a large amount of cash in Guangzhou. Although the Central Bank in Shanghai has recently issued a large amount of new banknotes with denominations of "100 yuan" and "500 yuan" every day, the shortage of banknotes among banks and firms is still extremely serious, which is the reason for this. Most of the capital flowing south is cash, carried by porters and travelers heading south.</p>
<h3>Draft Measures for Spot Gold Transactions: Gold Industry Association Has Prepared Them: To Be Promulgated and Implemented Once Approved by the Ministry of Finance: Preparations for Resumption of Business Are Being Accelerated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Gold Commercial Association has prepared a draft of measures for spot gold transactions, which was recently submitted to Minister of Finance Xu for review by Xu Fusun, a leading figure in the industry. It is said that the measures will be promulgated and implemented as soon as they are approved by the Ministry of Finance. According to Xu, the industry's preparations for resuming business are being accelerated. For example, the number of member companies resuming business is still in the application and registration phase. Since the industry has been suspended for a long time, member companies must raise additional capital and shareholders to resume business, which cannot be accomplished overnight. In addition, if the association's location is to be used as a centralized trading venue in the future, it will require some arrangement, such as installing one hundred telephones, which cannot be completed in a short period of time. All of this explains why the industry has been slow to resume business. This resumption of business refers to the resumption of business by member companies of the association, so there is no broker designation at all, and there is no question of collecting margin deposits. The membership fee for members will be determined based on the number of companies that register to resume business. The association's members are mostly partnerships, engaging in business based on credit, and the association has always been committed to serving its members, so there are no provisions for collecting large membership fees.</p>
<p>In addition, the association held another meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon, with more than ten directors and supervisors attending, chaired by Zhao Zhongying, the acting chairman of the association. During the meeting, a detailed discussion was held on the registration of members resuming business, the arrangement of venues, telephones, and various trading equipment, and it was decided to accelerate preparations to enable the resumption of business to be realized in the short term.</p>
<p>More than eighty applications for resumption of business have been received from members of the association. As for how many companies will actually resume business in the future, industry leaders believe that it is impossible to predict in the current environment.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Secretly Buying While Officially Selling: Gold Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The gold market opened high and closed high, with a sudden dip in the middle, showing a tortuous trend. The bulls exhausted themselves in cutting losses, with most being trapped. The bears did not fully gain the upper hand in the environment of a high opening and high closing. In the early morning, influenced by the easing of overnight credit, market sentiment was optimistic. Interbank interest rates were low, with supply at 85 yuan and demand at 95 yuan. Positions varied, and quotations were extremely chaotic. The market opened at 340 and 345. After opening, news that the Central Bank had raised the allocation price for gold allocated to jewelers strengthened market sentiment, and the overall outlook was optimistic. There was still strong buying interest on the surface, and the market rose to 347 and 350 at one point. After the high, major players feared a reversal and sold at high prices, causing the market to fall slightly. However, because the index was released, market sentiment was relatively strong, and retail investors frequently bought, so the market hovered around 340 without showing signs of weakness. However, due to repeated blows, the psychology was quite weak, and because new short positions were active, the market still saw more selling than buying, and the market hovered around 335 in the second session. Around 11:00, the Central Bank frequently exerted its power, and the market suddenly weakened, falling to 325 and 330. Finally, it fell into the 320s. The market was exhausted, and trading was sluggish. Subsequently, rumors spread that the Central Bank was buying after the low, so market sentiment rebounded, and the market rebounded again. The bulls bought, and the new shorts rushed to cover, causing the price to rise from 325 to 335, finally reaching the 350s, and closing in the afternoon at 345 and 352. In the afternoon, credit was even looser, and interbank interest rates fell to 0.55 yuan. Retail investors took advantage of the low price to consider entering, and market sentiment was quite strong, so the market opened at a high price of 385 and 390, then gradually softened, hovering around 380 first. After 3:00, it fell to around 375 again. After 4:00, it rebounded again, finally hovering around 380, and finally closed in the evening at 378 and 380.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the US dollar followed the fluctuations of gold. The market opened at 6,800 yuan and 6,900 yuan, fell to a low of 6,400 yuan, closed in the morning at 7,000 yuan and 7,050 yuan, opened in the afternoon at 7,700 yuan and 7,800 yuan, fell to a low of 7,500 yuan and 7,550 yuan, and closed in the evening at 7,550 yuan and 7,600 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of gold allocated by the National Bank to jewelers has now been decided by the Gold and Silver Stabilization Committee to be changed to 345,000 yuan per market tael, an increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Further Shrinks</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong exchange rate opened at 6 jiao 6 fen per thousand yuan yesterday morning, and closed at 7 jiao 1.5 fen the previous night. The gold yuan opened at 1 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen per thousand yuan yesterday morning, the same price as the previous evening's close. Hong Kong gold opened at 304 yuan per tael yesterday morning, and closed at 304 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen the previous night. The US dollar telegraphic transfer opened at 5 yuan 2 jiao 1 fen yesterday morning, and closed at 5 yuan 1 jiao 9 fen the previous night. The US dollar time draft opened at 5 yuan 1 jiao 9 fen yesterday morning, and closed at 5 yuan 1 jiao 8 fen the previous night. The US dollar opened at 5 yuan 1 jiao 6 fen yesterday morning, the same price as the previous evening's close.</p>
<h3>Credit Loosened Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday's credit trend gradually eased from level. At the initial opening, daily interbank interest rates still stood at 90 to 100 yuan. Subsequently, since the difference in interbank overnight payments was not significant, many intra-industry lenders supplied credit to the market. In addition, the national treasury and the municipal treasury disbursed approximately 2.5 billion yuan, and outward remittances totaled approximately 4 billion yuan, with domestic remittances accounting for half. The easing of credit gained momentum. Since the National Bank's unannounced selling of yarn had stopped and gold was also putting on a false show of strength, the market's ability to absorb credit diminished. As a result, daily interbank interest rates plummeted, with supply continuing even at 70 to 80 yuan, finally falling to a low of 60 yuan. The interbank position supply was abundant. The credit tightness that had lasted for more than a week showed signs of becoming more flexible.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cash situation remained tight because the National Bank continued to implement restrictions on banks, and the need for salary payments in various industries in the middle of the month increased. Rumors were rife that the National Bank authorities had taken the opportunity to issue 1,000-yuan banknotes, but according to a confidential source at the National Bank, this was not true. Currently, the 500-yuan banknotes are sufficient for circulation, so 1,000-yuan banknotes have not yet been issued in this city.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the National Bank's clearing difference was over 520 million yuan, the clearing difference for foreign firms was over 1.03 billion yuan, the clearing input for major clearing houses was over 930 million yuan, and the clearing input for minor clearing houses was over 610 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Joint Preparatory Committee of Banking and Money Industries to be Cleared and Dissolved Soon</h3>
<p>The Joint Preparatory Committee of the Banking and Money Industries of this city will soon announce its clearance and dissolution. According to the person in charge of the committee, the purpose of the Joint Preparatory Committee at the beginning of its establishment was for the banking and money industries to work together in times of trouble and provide mutual assistance when there were problems with capital turnover. However, the capital of the banking and money industries in this city is now very weak. Before the war, each bank could circulate the capital of several factories, but now the opposite is true, and the deposits of each factory can control several banks and money shops. This is enough to prove that the crisis in the banking and money industries is becoming increasingly serious today. The Joint Preparatory Committee of the Banking and Money Industries cannot play a role in this situation and has no need to exist, so it has been decided to announce its dissolution.</p>
<h3>Market Commentary: Spectator's Stand</h3>
<p>Whether they show their power depends on today and tomorrow. The battle between British and American gold and banknotes is coming to an end, with the United States winning.</p>
<p>According to statistics from an authoritative agency, yesterday's price index was 1,873 times that of August 19, which is equal to 643 times the cost of living index at the beginning of the month, an increase of about threefold. The current index released last night was 1,339 times, equal to twice the beginning of the month. This means that the cost of living index for the current period has been reduced by about 30%.</p>
<p>All the employees in the city got 1,339 times their wages, that's last night. But yesterday morning, various markets had already started to rise. Like food and wuyang etc, most rose by 20%; that is to say: the 1,339 times wages were invisibly reduced by 20% again.</p>
<p>This lesson, has become as natural to the workers as human instinct, and a movement to exchange goods will immediately unfold in the next few days. Therefore, the next few days will be the touchstone of whether the financial authorities can control the market.</p>
<p>In the past week, the capitalists knocked out goods and prepared the salaries to be paid yesterday. The financial authorities took advantage of the situation and uniquely enjoyed the glory of controlling the market. The next few days will be days of headwinds. It is much more difficult to steer in the headwinds, so those who can steer in the headwinds are truly capable.</p>
<p>Half a month ago, the overt and covert struggles between the United States and the Britain in finance, set off a not-so-small storm in the world gold market. We have repeatedly analyzed in the past that it was: Britain wanted to raise the price of gold and suppress the US dollar. The United States wanted to maintain the US dollar and suppress the price of gold. Therefore, the price of gold in the Americas was stable, and the price of gold rose on the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>This overt and covert struggle seems to be coming to an end in the past week. Facts have proven the failure of Britain and the victory of the United States again.</p>
<p>The price of gold in various parts of the world has gradually fallen back in the past week. The price of gold in France has fallen to the lowest price seen in eight years. Argentina, originally instigated by Britain, controlled gold in an attempt to stimulate the gold markets in South American countries, following the rise in Africa. Now, Argentina has also abolished this control.</p>
<p>During Britain's mischief against the US dollar, the Soviet Union also did a lot of cheering, and even single-handedly wantonly purchased gold in Milan, Vienna, and Berlin. Now they have also stopped purchasing. The announcement by the Bank of France that France's gold reserves reached 875 million pounds further contributed to the tragic decline in already collapsed gold prices.</p>
<p>When Britain was making trouble for the US dollar, the Hong Kong gold market also did a lot of responsibility in the Far East. Now that Britain has a tendency to cover up and rest, the Hong Kong market should also react. But the trend of gold and banknotes in Hong Kong last week only showed the firmness of the US dollar.</p>
<p>The price of gold and banknotes in this city, in addition to the influence of the local scenery, is also greatly stimulated by Hong Kong. Even if Hong Kong is still stable, the gold and banknotes in this city are purely determined by local factors in the future.</p>
<h3>Credit Shifts to Relax, Going Downhill is Relatively Good; Rice Went Up Again Yesterday: High-Quality White Rice Once Knocked on the 40,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The rice market rebounded again yesterday. The South Rice Market opened slightly higher by 400 or 500 yuan. Then, due to the relaxation of credit, rice shops increased their purchases and the market rose by 2,000 or 3,000. Bo Dao [thin rice] once reached the 40,000 yuan mark. Then, due to the fatigue of gold prices, market sentiment softened, and prices fell back slightly. Bo Dao closed at 39,000, up 2,000 yuan. In the Northern Market, white rice and Bo Dao opened at 38,000 yuan each, up 1,500 yuan each. Extra-quality rice knocked on the 40,000 yuan mark. A total of 3,605 shi were registered for arrival at the second market.</p>
<p>Edible oil hovered and rose. Because credit had slightly loosened and rice prices had already risen in Shanghai, the goods owner held steady. Soybean oil initially opened at 148,000 yuan, and the market once fell back to 146,000 yuan. Finally, soybean oil traded at 151,000 yuan, and raw rapeseed oil closed at 149,000 yuan, up 8,000 to 9,000 yuan. Raw oil rose by 5,000 yuan, and Qingdao Jibao raw oil traded at 185,000 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil and tea oil were still level. Soybean cake also fluctuated little.</p>
<p>The flour market turned firm. In the early market, with the loosening of credit, the Northern gang slightly increased purchases. The rice price had soared, and market sentiment was very excited. Lao Che [old car] initially pressed against the 16,000 yuan mark. Bing Chuan [warship] once traded high at 15,450 yuan. Midway, the market fluctuated violently due to the rise and fall of gold and stock prices. After the market closed, the big households made considerable purchases. Bing Chuan rebounded to 15,300 yuan, and Lao Che was quoted at 15,800 yuan. The sale of bran by wholesale and retailers was sluggish, and the market showed a slight downward trend.</p>
<p>The coarse grain market was affected by the firmness of the outside circle and rose sharply across the board in the early market. Jiujiang Dongdou [winter bean] traded highest at 33,000 yuan, and local bean rose to 31,500 yuan. Later, the oil cake market weakened, and purchases from wholesalers and factories were sluggish. The price of Dongdou fell by 10%, and the price of local beans fell below the 30,000 yuan mark. Sheng Ren [raw peanut] rose slightly by 5,000 yuan. The price of corn and sesame turned weak in the later market.</p>
<h3>Outbound Tea Firm</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to tea industry related people recently, although overseas markets still favor Chinese tea, prices have recently surged, and tea costs have followed suit, gradually detaching from the price overseas. The export price thus lacks something. British firm Jardine Matheson once resumed their offensive on Keemun black tea, but sellers have been resolute and ultimately failed. Overall, the export of Chinese tea currently does not have an optimistic outlook, and the consistent trend is stable.</p>
<p>The internal tea market is experiencing a tight squeeze. However, the market price continues to appear steady, the only reason being, that the old tea reserves are empty, and new goods are not yet produced, for various reasons, sellers do not relax their sales intentions, and there are still not many transactions, with only this street slightly involved, and other places have not yet started activity.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Mediocre</h3>
<p>After tung oil has been trending downward from the other day, the market today and tomorrow are due to ease due to relaxed credit among those in the industry. At the same time, foreign exchange certificates are rising sharply, so the seller's intention to raise prices has recurred. The process is gradually rising, but the buyers were aware of overseas markets are sluggish and sales are sluggish in the domestic spring, so they do not want to desperately procure so the situation is quite like a flash in the pan and plummeted sharply. The final results are similar to the previous day, and no changes have been seen.</p>
<h3>Wood Rising</h3>
<p>The market price of Chinese fir has risen to 280 yuan, although the actual sales of foreign pine and Liu'an pine are sluggish, the market price is required to be 800 yuan based on the mixed colors. Liu'an plywood has risen to 3,600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Generally Rises, Cloth Sales Lack Vigor</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation yesterday was that the industry's credit turned loose, and external conditions were all reported firm. The yarn market also followed suit, and new purchases were gradually promoted. Southern China also continued to purchase, and this street also had to pay off. However, interbank interest rates still stood at around 90 yuan, so people still had concerns.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened at 2.72 million yuan, and at one point it loosened to 2.62 million yuan. It closed in the morning at 2.66 million yuan, finally rising by 150,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 140,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon rose by 50,000 yuan, closing at 1.69 million yuan. 21-count Flower Double Horse spot goods, after opening at 1.4 million yuan, immediately saw a downward trend, reaching a low of 1.32 million yuan.

<p>The cotton cloth market hovered and rose slightly. Sales to customers remained flat, and buying interest in this street was also slack. The green color was due to the slightly loose appearance of credit, but the interbank interest rates in the market were still high, so everyone was selling off goods and lending money, causing the situation that wanted to rise to shrink again.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth initially opened at a high of 53,500 yuan, but then many in the industry sold off at high prices, and finally it was difficult to resist, retreating to close at 51,000 yuan, which was 2,500 yuan higher than before. Labatong fine cloth rose by 2,000 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Biji [fabric] initially opened at 50,800 yuan and was bid up to 51,000 yuan all the way, but at the close it squeezed into 49,000 yuan, up 2,600 yuan. Jinlian Miaowu Yuan Biji rose by 2,000 yuan, closing at 47,500 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the cost of living index being released, which was more than double that of the previous period, market sentiment was bullish, and various cloths rose slowly. Finally, it was heard that Sijunzi Yuan Biji traded at 54,200 yuan.</p>

<h3>Silk Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the artificial silk market, credit loosened, hidden interest rates fell, and market sentiment was stimulated by the release of the cost of living index, and buying interest turned strong. At the morning opening, 120 Tiangiao [brand name] was initially at 1.725 million yuan.

<h3>Business Briefs</h3>

<p>The market price of pig iron has risen sharply. Australian goods are opening at a high of 500,000, and Taiwanese goods have also reached 300,000. It is reported that the reason for this price increase is that holders of goods are raising the gold price ratio. For example, if the previously set price for Australian goods was one tael of gold per ton, now, because Anshan goods are asking for one tael and are being made, the Australian goods are asking for one and a half taels. Taiwanese goods also have a similar trend, but have not reached the one tael standard.</p>
<p>Since refined steel products have become darlings of the era, copper products have obviously been gradually abandoned. As a result, aluminum rods have become a mature raw material in the copper and tin market. According to an industry insider, aluminum rods were originally mostly shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai, but in recent years they have been sourced from Nanjing. The reason is that Nanjing does not produce aluminum; the source is dismantled from old aircraft that are no longer usable. It is said that each aircraft can yield approximately four to five tons of scrap aluminum, which is purchased by merchants, re-smelted into bars, and shipped to Shanghai for distribution. However, this is not always available, so it is said that when there is no scrap aluminum for sale in Nanjing, it affects the price increase in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Industrial oils remain stable. The arrival of asphalt from the South Road is small, and actual sales are not very strong. Tallow sales are more active, and the market shouted a rise of 5,000 yuan yesterday. Singaporean coconut oil still stands at 20 yuan per barrel, and Hainan Island oil is about 5,000 yuan less.</p>

<h3>Renyu vs. Encas: A Tightly Contested and Hard-Fought Match, the Score Fluctuates and the Game is Exciting</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The basketball league featured an exciting match last night. After 40 minutes of hard fighting, Renyu won the final victory with a score of 38 to 34, defeating the strong team Encas. The game was tight throughout, with the lead changing hands frequently.

Su Shifeng's performance last night was good. Every move was well-founded. Wei Yuping's "stealing cold rice" was also unexpected. As a result, Maoxun won 44 to 33.</p>

<h3>"Black Eats Black" Peifeier Defeats Haiqing</h3>
<p>Peifeier versus Haiqing, two American military teams, a naval battle. Peifeier had full potential. Haiqing's passes were often intercepted halfway. Among the ten warriors on both sides, there were always more than three blacks, adding a lot of color (black). In the first half, Peifeier had 31, and Haiqing had 12.</p>
<p>Haiqing did a lot in the second half, but they had many opportunities under the basket. They could have shot themselves but still passed to others, which was enough to show their "unselfish" spirit. Ekat and Bolang of Peifeier, and Bo Lunhuo and Kaikeer of Haiqing were the main characters on both sides. In the end, Peifeier Kelishi scored with a single-handed breakthrough. The blacks on both sides marked each other, with a "black eats black" posture. At 56 to 36, Peifei defeated Haiqing by a large margin.</p>

<h3>British Navy Launches Third Expedition: Today's Clash with Qingbai Team</h3>
<p>The British Navy's London football team recently returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and has played two friendly matches with strong Chinese teams. In the first match, they drew 1-1 with the Railway team. In the second match, they were narrowly defeated 2-3 by the leading team, Longtou. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, they will play their third match against the Shanghai champion Qingbai team at the Yiyuan Stadium. Tickets are still sold at 400 yuan for ordinary seats and 600 yuan for special seats. Sales will begin at the Municipal Stadium at 2:30 PM. The referee is He Chunhui, and the linesmen are Ding Shunbao and Pan En. Qingbai will notify all players to wear red and black jerseys and gather directly at Yiyuan.</p>
<p>Qingbai is the leading football team in Shanghai and has won the Mayor's Cup for three consecutive years. This year, during the semifinals, they lost hope of winning the championship due to underestimating the enemy and being poisoned by Zhonghang. However, the Group A championship of the league seems likely to be taken without any problems. The entire team, under the leadership of veteran Meng Yiliang, has four knights, Huang Shijie, Jiang Yuqing, Xue Peiran, and Fu Naitang, guarding the rear, and five tigers, Luo Shoufu, Jin Lusheng, Gu Yiche, Liu Longxun, and Liu Tiyin, lined up on the front line. The military appearance is complete and unmatched.</p>
<p>The British Navy London team is a strong team among British sailors. They have a crisp and spicy foot and abundant stamina. The match against Longtou fully demonstrated its characteristics. Although it lost by one goal, the performance was very excellent, and it was greatly appreciated by people inside and outside the circle. Today, they will meet the champion, and the exciting battle is expected. The players on the team are the same as when they fought the Railway team. The lineups of Qingbai are listed separately below:</p>
<p>Qingbai</p>
<p>Huang Shijie</p>

<h3>Sports World: Discussing the Situation of Hong Kong Football</h3>
<h3>Chinese Team Has a Better Chance of Winning the Group A Runner-Up, and the Bus Team Is Quite Confident of Winning the Group B Championship</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] Although the championship of this year's Group A League is bound to be won by South China South, the runner-up issue has suddenly become subtle due to the fact that Chinese team broke through the difficult hurdle of Kitchee again in a hard fight last Monday. Although the Bus team finally won against Hong Kong Club, the victory was quite dangerous. According to the rules, each team in Group A will play a total of 24 matches. Chinese team has already played 19 times and only has five matches left. The Bus team still needs to play eight matches. The opponents are South China, South China South, Navy, and Eastern. According to the current situation, Chinese team has a high probability of being able to win six more points. The most difficult challenges in the next five matches are South China South and the Bus team. The Bus team has the disadvantage of different prices at different times. Although their defeat to the Navy team was accidental, they did not perform well on the big stage of a free-for-all match at home last Sunday. Although the other team scored a penalty kick first, they only won by a small margin of three to two. It is doubtful that they will be able to score more points in the next eight matches. The challenges they face are actually more difficult than those of Chinese team. In addition to the most difficult challenge of South China South, they also need to play against Chinese team once, Kitchee twice, and St. Joseph's and the Police, who will always try their best against Hua teams. None of these can be said to be guaranteed victories. Although they are sure to win against Guanghua and the Air Force in two matches, how can it be considered certain that they can win the runner-up?</p>
<p>People say that the runner-up will be decided when the Bus team meets Chinese team again on the 26th of this month. However, I say that if Chinese team wins at that time, the runner-up will definitely belong to Chinese team. However, if the victory belongs to the Bus team at that time, I still think it is not permissible to be optimistic about the Bus team, because Kitchee is also a strong team. It is not easy to win one match, let alone say that the Bus team will win both matches against Kitchee. Therefore, I think that the runner-up issue in Group A will not be confirmed until the last week of the season. In the situation where South China South is sure to win the championship, there is such an embellishment, and the football league has not caused the audience to feel too bored.</p>
<p>One team being too strong inevitably reduces interest. No wonder the psychology of the audience in this year's football matches cannot be raised to the level of the triangular competition of the pre-war Southeast Star. Fortunately, there is still a very spectacular match to come, that is, the league champion will perform against the joint team. I think that if the joint team can use Tan Jun'gan, Gaoshanlong, Xu Jingcheng, Weida Luo, Hou Lu, Feng Kunsheng, Siweiya, Li Chunfa, Deng Yijie, Zou Wenzhi, and Li Dahui as their lineup to play against South China South, the tension will not be less than when the Chinese team played against Seoul in the league.</p>
<p>After two wins against Kowloon Army, the situation in Group B for Chinese team is also very subtle. Although the current Chinese team is at the top of the list with 34 points, they have actually lost one more point than the Bus team. There are still ten matches to come, and there are difficult challenges against South China, the Bus team, Kitchee, and the Navy. The reason why Kitchee and the Navy are also listed as difficult challenges is because when Chinese team first met Kitchee, they only drew a 3-3 tie, and when they met the Navy, they only won by a score of 1-0. The Bus team still has thirteen matches, and the difficult challenges include South China, Kitchee, the Navy, Hong Kong Army, and Kowloon Army. These challenges are also more difficult than those of Chinese team. However, in terms of personnel, the Bus team is actually the most prosperous in Group B. I still think that the call for the championship is actually the highest for the Bus team. The team's situation is not as bad as its Group A team. (Lai Duanfu)</p>
<h3>Novel Betting Method in Hong Kong: Football Lottery for Sale</h3>
<h3>Each Bet Ranges from Ten to Thousands of Yuan</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] On the 12th of this month, the Kowloon Detective Department received a tip that someone was selling a football lottery. Hua Detective Chief Liu Fu led detectives Ye Fa and Xie Binglin to No. 61 Kimberley Road, G/F, and arrested a European man suspected of being involved. Several dozen copies of the lottery and instructions were seized and filed. On the same day, the defendant was allowed to post bail of 500 yuan. The case was brought before Magistrate Keu Si of the Kowloon Magistrates' Court yesterday. The defendant, Robert Hu Li, 45, from Edinburgh, Scotland, residing at No. 60 Kimberley Road, G/F, was charged with operating a gambling den at his residence on the 12th of this month. The defendant did not appear in court yesterday. Kowloon Detective Chief Mo Daolin applied to the court for a postponement. The magistrate ordered the case to be postponed for trial today. It was found that this type of football lottery was prevalent in England, but it was the first time it had been seen in Hong Kong. Therefore, the content of the gambling is not known to the public, and the police did not disclose it yesterday. However, it was learned from rumors that the purchase of this lottery is not limited to its amount, ranging from ten yuan to thousands of yuan. The seller of this lottery has established an organization specializing in accepting bets from such gamblers. Hong Kong is the football kingdom of the Far East, and every time there is an important football match, tens of thousands of people flock to watch it. Therefore, who wins and who loses is also of great concern to football fans. They bet on the teams they think will win. There are also many people betting on the football league held every weekend. Therefore, this type of lottery is revealed by a gambling master. However, there are many types of gambling. In addition to betting on which team will win, there are also bets on the number of goals scored by each player, and who will score the first goal, who will score the second goal, etc., similar to purchasing place tickets in horse racing. If an upset occurs, the bettors who purchase this upset will make a large profit. Therefore, the leisurely class flocks to it. It is heard that the sellers of this type of lottery take a profit-sharing approach, that is, after deducting the profits they want to obtain, they will calculate the bonus with all of the gambling funds received. Because there are many people who buy it, their profits are quite considerable.</p>
<h3>Women's Basketball Tactics</h3>
<p>— Translated and Narrated by Zhou Gong</p>
<p>I've wanted to write about women's basketball tactics for a long time, because: I faintly heard that the Basketball Committee authorities are preparing to adopt Canadian women's rules in the Mayor's Cup, which is why I put down my pen again.</p>
<p>Last week, I ran into a female basketball star who said that everyone only pays attention to studying men's tactics, and that people generally mention women's tactics less often, which is somewhat sexist. Her sarcastic remark encouraged me to pick up my pen again. Although these are just fragmented offensive and defensive tactics for women's basketball, they may become suitable teaching materials for teams that are just starting to play basketball.</p>
<p>In any sport, correct basic movements are a necessary foundation for an athlete. Being able to have correct basic movements, using them skillfully, and adding valuable experience will make one a mature athlete. In a basketball team, if you have six mature players, and the coach trains them to implement tactics skillfully, then because of familiarity, they will become even more skilled, and this team will become a formidable force.</p>
<p>During practice, you can see some players whose fixed two-handed shooting movements are not yet correct, but they go on to practice one-handed shooting; their footwork and turning movements are not yet proficient, so they often commit the traveling violation when holding the ball.</p>
<p>Therefore, many teams focus on adopting tactical play, but neglect the practice and correction of individual basic movements, resulting in awkward movements, lack of smoothness, clumsiness, and frequent fouls. If the basic movements are not fundamentally improved, then skills are like rowing upstream: if you don't advance, you retreat. How can you hope to become a top-tier team?</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yangming said: "When a gentleman shoots, he must have upright intentions within and a straight posture without, hold the bow and arrow carefully and firmly, and then he can speak of hitting the mark." This points out that if a student archer does not have the intention of upright intentions within and a straight posture without, then even if he holds the bow, aims the arrow, draws the bow fully, and releases, he will not hit the mark.</p>
<p>Mozi also said, "A good bow is hard to draw, but then it can reach high and deep; a good horse is hard to ride, but then it can bear weight and go far." This also says that a good bow is hard to draw, but if one can use the correct method of drawing the bow, one can shoot the arrow high and far; a good horse is hard to ride, but if one understands the correct method of riding, one can bear weight and go far. If a basketball player wants to become a future star, they must start with correct movements, and first have correct basic movements, use them skillfully, and then the second step can be to enter the door of tactical application.</p>
<p>Mr. Forrest Foornan of the University of California has a good understanding of defensive tactics in women's basketball. The following are his views on defensive tactics in women's basketball.</p>
<p>In terms of defensive tactics in basketball, there has been great progress and great changes, divided into (1) man-to-man defense, (2) fixed zone defense, and (3) moving zone defense.</p>
<p>Man-to-man defense is where each defender is responsible for guarding one opponent, moving when they move and stopping when they stop.</p>
<p>Fixed zone defense is where each defender is responsible for guarding their own area, not allowing the offensive player to have the opportunity to break into the shooting area.</p>
<p>Moving zone defense is where three defenders must be united as one, must have a tacit cooperation, and must fill in each other's positions when moving.</p>
<p>Speaking separately, man-to-man defense is easier to implement. A player with experience prefers to use man-to-man defense, because he only needs to guard one offensive player, moving when the player moves and stopping when the player stops, not allowing her to easily get a good shooting opportunity. (To be continued) (1)</p>
<h3>Last Week's Basketball Commentary Significant Progress of Foreign Players in the Second Round</h3>
<p>In the two matches of the A-League last week, Hualian made great efforts after receiving new players, easily defeating Haiqing 56-42; MacLaines used tactics after training, defeating the out-of-form Shanghai Police 57-42. Due to Pfeiffer's victory over Hualian and MacLaines' victory over Shanghai Police, foreign player teams have made significant progress in the second round of the competition. In the upcoming Mayor's Cup, the strong Chinese teams will not be able to rest easy.</p>
<p>The strength of Haiqing in the later stages is not as good as that of Haiqing in the early stages. In the early stages, Haiqing still had a black player, and a defender who controlled the ball with his left hand. This team of Haiqing does not have a single player who is good at controlling the ball. They only rely on courage and lack intelligence. In defense, they could not contain Hualian's forwards, and exposed loopholes early in the first half, allowing Hualian to use fast attacks to score many points, forcing Haiqing's defense to collapse completely.</p>
<p>In offense, Haiqing did not break through Hualian's man-to-man defense. There was no player who was good at controlling the ball to create opportunities. When they were forced to a situation where they could not execute, they made mistaken passes and wasted opportunities. Therefore, Hualian's quick attacks and accurate shooting forced Haiqing to catch their breath with a score of 38 to 18 in the first half, and the whole situation was one of being beaten. In the second half, Hualian used a slow attack, controlling all the rebounds under the basket. Winning was easy and effortless. This battle was like a strong team facing a weak team, like hitting a stone with an egg, and there was nothing exciting about it.</p>
<p>Shanghai Police was in a slump in the last two games, and met MacLaines, who was performing at their peak, so a defeat was unavoidable.</p>
<p>Controlling the rebounds under the basket was MacLaines' top priority in breaking Shanghai Police's defense. In the overall game, the rebounds under the basket were almost entirely controlled by the foreign players. After Wang Rongsheng was penalized off the field and Shi Jiuquan was transferred out, MacLaines' tall player controlled the rebounds under the basket at will, and Shanghai Police lost more points at this time, and the situation was over.</p>
<p>Shanghai Police relies on skillful shooting to win. When they are on a hot streak, they can make nine out of ten shots and gain momentum and get on a roll. Unfortunately, in this game, they were not in good form when they took the field. Wang Bowen, who is good at long-range shots, only made one out of ten shots. Under MacLaines' tight zone defense, the central playmaker could not perform, and cross-cuts were also hindered. Shooting from sharp angles resulted in more misses than hits. If they did not hit and the rebounds under the basket all fell into the hands of the foreign player's tall player, Shanghai Police's scoring relied only on Wang Rongsheng and Liang Rongbiao's long shots, and occasionally He Zeng got the opportunity to sneak in. The team's form was not good, and the players, although brave, were also timid, and lost all confidence. Shanghai Police's abnormal performance was even worse than the game against Hualian, probably due to fatigue from too much practice. The players should pay attention to getting plenty of rest this week.</p>
<p>MacLaines' performance at their peak had solid defense. When attacking, they used smoke screens to cut into the basket and lay it in, which was clear and beautiful. When throwing the ball inbounds under the opponent's basket, they used a three-man parallel tactic, but the application was not yet proficient, and was far inferior to Pfeiffer's team's performance. The tall player Reese is the soul of the team. He is a player who is good at controlling the ball. Not only did he score 28 points himself, but he also created scoring opportunities for his forwards. Winning is based on a team's style of play. There is no flashy performance. The players are young and inexperienced, but their skills are improving, and they are one of the foreign player teams most welcomed by the audience. (Qi Gong)</p>

<h3>Remembering Rice Tickets in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Qi Nian</p>
<p>"Rice tickets" in the countryside, like "Yuan Datou" silver dollars in major cities, have emerged in the towns and villages along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line in Jiangsu and Kunshan in the past six months. They are more loved than the majestic Gold Yuan Notes, and they have effectively taken over in the countryside, becoming a de facto currency.</p>
<p>As early as last year during the "August 19th" price controls, restrictions on food reserves were quite strict, so the villagers deposited their excess grain in rice shops to avoid the eyes and ears of inspectors. The shops then issued a piece of paper, stating the name of the product, quantity, and depositor's name, etc. This was originally a receipt-style deposit slip. Who knew that soon after, due to the needs of the environment and reality, it would stand out and be exchanged in the market, becoming the "rice tickets" that are now widely popular in the countryside.</p>
<p>In itself, it is simple and unadorned, and its appearance is far inferior to that of the Gold Yuan Notes. It is a thin sheet of Daolin paper, printed in black ink, which is considered the most sophisticated. Otherwise, a small square of white newsprint, written with a brush and stamped with an antique vermilion shop seal, would also do the trick. And if even a clean sheet of paper is too much to spare, simply use a cigarette paper shell or a waste paper from a tooth powder bag, write a few words on the blank part on the back, and stamp it with a seal. Even this crude method can be used in the market and is equally trusted and treasured by the villagers.</p>
<p>Rice tickets often have a note added: "Settled at market price, no goods without payment." Thus, although it is a check that is nominally worthless and cannot be cashed, it has great magic power in the countryside. When prices are fluctuating violently, if you use Gold Yuan Notes to buy goods, the shop often imposes restrictions; but if you use "rice tickets" for the transaction, the shopkeepers will smile happily and are happy to do business with you, no matter how large the quantity. Conversely, when the villagers raise pigs like fattened piglets and bring them to the market to negotiate prices, they show difficulty if given cash, and ask if there are any "rice tickets." Sometimes, when trading with "rice tickets," even if the price is reduced somewhat, they are willing to accept it. Rice tickets and Gold Yuan Notes are both just pieces of paper, but the difference between the two in the minds of the people in the countryside is like heaven and earth. Is this just a matter of luck and misfortune?</p>
<p>Recently, the countryside is not peaceful, and the rice and grain stored in farmers' homes are easily coveted by bandits, so they are even more willing to transport the rice to the market and exchange it for "rice tickets." In this way, even if it is stolen, it can be reported lost and stopped for payment as a remedy. And a thin piece of paper can be stored in clothing and is easy to carry. When cash is needed, it can be settled at the market price at any time, and it is not affected by the devaluation of paper money. The shop will pay you a斗 or two, or a石 or two, as you like, as long as it is noted on the ticket, and they will never find it troublesome.</p>
<p>For rice shop owners, they can use the deposited rice as working capital, and under the condition of "no goods without payment," this batch of transactions can be safely placed in their shop, without fear of them going elsewhere, so they are all happy to accept the villagers' deposits. Thus, the situation of "rice tickets" flying all over the streets in the countryside is far more common than bank checks in the city. This is also a strange thing in a chaotic world.</p>
<h3>The Problems and Identification of Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>This column has discussed "silver dollars" for two years, and the calls for "buying" and "selling" silver dollars have spread throughout the city. However, there are many defects in silver dollars, and there are also counterfeit products. In the past, when silver dollars were the standard currency, everyone was familiar with silver dollars, and it was still difficult to avoid being deceived. Now, more than ten years have passed, and most of the buyers are amateurs who do not know the defects, so they are easily fooled. Therefore, the methods of identifying defects and counterfeit products in silver dollars are briefly described as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Filing the edge: That is, the raised edge around the silver dollar has been filed off to take the silver layer, resulting in a reduction in weight.</p>
<p>(2) Acid: Silver dollars have been put into nitric acid to corrode and extract the silver.</p>
<p>The above two items can reduce the weight of the silver group, but they are still easy to identify with careful observation. Because of the acid, the pattern of the silver dollar will inevitably lose its spirit or be blurred; if you file the edge, you can see the pattern by careful observation. If it is hot to the touch when holding it, you can place the silver dollar on the tip of your middle finger and lift it to know if its weight is insufficient.</p>
<p>(3) Copper lining: This cannot be done without skilled craftsmen. The method is to saw open one side of the silver dollar, dig out the silver in the middle, fill it with copper, and then cover the silver surface well and install it properly. The surface is not easy to detect. However, this will inevitably reduce the weight, because the copper filled cannot fill the dug-out place. If it is filled, it will become a "dumb plate," so a slight space must be left, so the weight is of course insufficient. Also, if you strike this circle on its edge, the fitted side will inevitably show cracks; also, observe the pattern on its surface, it will inevitably be more rigid, and the sound will also be different. But this cannot be identified without a skilled hand.</p>
<p>(4) Copper filling: On the surface of the silver dollar, in the concave and convex areas of the pattern, choose the ones that can be dug and filled, dig out a small piece, and fill it with copper. It is not easy to identify at first glance, but it always feels different with careful inspection.</p>
<p>(5) All copper: This is a counterfeit coin, its quality is pure copper, and it is plated with silver on the outside. When you strike two circles together, the sound is wide and sharp, and the pattern is also very rigid.</p>
<p>(6) All lead: That is, silver dollars are cast purely with lead. They can be mixed in at the beginning, but after being stained with sweat, they gradually change color, and it is easy to identify when compared with the silver color.</p>
<p>In short, with careful observation, even an outsider is not easily deceived; with carelessness and impatience, even an old hand will inevitably be fooled. There is also a method: clamp the silver dollar with two fingers, blow air with your mouth, listen to it near your ear, and if the whole thing makes a slight ringing sound, it is genuine, otherwise it is fake. This is also a technique, but I am afraid it cannot fully identify the above-mentioned defects.</p>
<h3>Soy Milk</h3>
<p>— Sang</p>
<p>Soy milk, also known as tofu milk, is a very common soy food in our country, especially in Shanghai, it is an extremely popular beverage for the masses. However, European and American countries have only discovered its value in recent years, and they beautifully call it "soy milk."</p>
<p>Recently, according to research by many scientists in the United States, it has received a very high evaluation and is being promoted as a substitute for cow's milk.</p>
<p>Soy milk is similar to cow's milk, and its composition is very similar to human milk, and it is superior to it. It contains one-half of the fat and protein of human milk, the same amount of lime, and twice the amount of iron as human milk. It lacks carbohydrates, which makes it a suitable food for people with diabetes; and if needed, lactose or maltose can be added to make up for it.</p>
<p>Soy milk is easier to digest than cow's milk. Because the coagulum formed by soy milk in the stomach is smaller than that of cow's milk, it requires less gastric digestive juice.</p>
<p>Soy milk can also avoid many diseases caused by cow's milk. Its production process is convenient, the price is low, and the yield is large. However, most Chinese people do not know how to further study and improve its production methods and nutrition, and only know how to stick to old methods. Moreover, those Westernized gentlemen despise soy milk as food for vendors and pedestrians and do not bother to show it. Now that even the most developed and advanced United States is studying and praising soy milk, I wonder what those gentlemen who think "the moon is better abroad" think?</p>

<h3>"Promoting Dancing" to Save the Country and Other Things</h3>
<p>— Lei Ting</p>
<p>This topic, at first glance, seems a bit not solemn; however, it is a fact. In the past, we did have "dancing to save the country," and we also shouted this slogan. Now, "The Political Committee of the Huazhong Suppression Headquarters is considering opening up the dance ban in order to increase the number of self-defense special donations." At the time, the reporter added a note: "The sound of 'promenading' (dancing) that has been quiet for a long time in Hankou City is about to rise again" (both seen in this newspaper's Hankou 9th report).</p>
<p>Self-defense is to protect the people, and protecting the people is to save the country. Therefore, although the Hankou authorities did not explicitly shout the slogan "dancing to save the country" this time, it is the same to enhance the work of saving the country by opening up the dance ban. However, Mr. Chan Jia and others must not confuse dancing and saving the country, thinking that only dancing can save the country, and if you want to teach the country, you can only dance; otherwise, they will misunderstand the authorities' hardship in allowing or prohibiting dancing, and allowing it in one place but prohibiting it in another, so that there will be the idea that the authorities sometimes allow saving the country, sometimes prohibit saving the country, or allow it in one place but prohibit it in another, which would be far from the truth.</p>
<p>From my personal point of view, I neither like nor hate dancing, because I simply cannot dance. But dancing is not a sinful act, I am sure of that. The reason for my conviction is not because "foreign countries also have it," but because it is indeed a fact. As for the bad things that happen because of dancing, they are no more than the same as some people doing even worse things under grand and high-sounding titles. This is a people problem.</p>
<p>But not long ago, dancing was prohibited under the bigger titles of "correcting customs" and "practicing frugality," and it was prohibited so vigorously. Although Shanghai relaxed the ban because of a strike by the dancers, the ban was still to be banned. Drawing lots was to show that it was banned.</p>
<p>Since it is banned, the authorities naturally think that dancing is a sinful act, without any doubt. We small people, standing in the position of supporting the authorities' policies, also practiced "what the authorities hate, hate it," isn't that a good model of cooperation between officials and the people? And this good model has been amplified.</p>
<p>However, this time Hankou City reopened the ban in order to increase special donations. Special donations are important, but can we not need to "correct customs" and not need to "practice frugality" because of their importance? Or has Hankou City already corrected customs and practiced frugality after banning dancing once?</p>
<p>If the answer is the latter, we are truly happy for the achievements of banning dancing, but at the same time we are worried about the customs after opening dancing; if the answer is the former, then we are even more worried that the scope of "imprisoning in the emblem" will increase day by day.</p>
<p>Although this is a small matter, we can also understand other things.</p>
<h3>The King of Song, Bing Crosby</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Bing Crosby has become one of the leading entertainers in the United States today. With his voice, from the stage, to the microphone, to the screen, his voice is sweet and pleasant to everyone, and everyone seems to be enchanted. When he sings a new song, tens of thousands of copies of the song can be sold out in an instant. His recorded records have become the best-selling products.</p>
<p>Bing Crosby himself doesn't think he has a satisfactory singing voice. He stepped onto the throne of the King of Song, and he still feels a little inexplicable. When he left school, he didn't think about taking the path of singing, because he was a very ordinary person and didn't show any special talents. His brother only knew that he was still diligent. The two brothers thought at the time that singing was the easiest job, so they embarked on this path, making him a brilliant singing star today.</p>
<p>Initially, Bing Crosby recorded for Decca Records. The following year, he worked for Paramount Pictures. When Bing Crosby embarked on the path of singing, he took advantage of his singing voice, followed his own wishes, and destroyed all traditional singing rules without reservation. Although he did not follow the rules of singing, this new tone was very popular with people. Both Decca and Paramount were unwilling to discuss his resignation.</p>
<p>Bing Crosby has been working as a singer for twenty years. In those twenty years, in addition to singing on stage, innumerable radio broadcasts, and no way to leave a record, there are 698 songs recorded on wax discs. Among them, one song, the Christmas reading "Silent Night" recorded fifteen years ago, is Bing Crosby's most prestigious singing and the best-selling record. There are 38 films left on the film soundtrack, and recently there is also a "In the Court of King Joseph," which has been filmed and has not yet been released. In 1944, he was voted the best actor by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for playing Father O'Malley in the film "Going My Way." But to this day, Bing Crosby only admits that he is a singer, not a movie star.</p>
<p>Bing Crosby is a typical American, and his speech, attitude, and life are all American style. Even his singing voice and tone are thoroughly American. He likes to meet people with his original face everywhere. What we see on the screen is mostly his true face, and even when playing other roles, it is consistent with his original posture. Bing Crosby also has a characteristic that he will never be cold. No matter what he does, whether it is singing, dancing, or just standing quietly on the side, he can show his personality and give others an impression.</p>
<p>Today, Bing Crosby is a person with a very large income. But he lived a wandering life in his early years. When he fell in love with movie star Lindsay, and wanted to marry her, he was provoked by someone who said that he had no money and no special talents, and that his future life was worrying. Although he has now emerged, he still does not forget the poor and humble times in the past. His family lives near the Los Angeles Club, and they live a very simple life, with no luxurious atmosphere. In the broadcasting studio, he likes to talk to assistants, workers, etc. He said: "These people are upright and open-minded, and it is most enjoyable to interact with them." This is what Bing Crosby said to others, but it is also the feeling that others have of him.</p>
