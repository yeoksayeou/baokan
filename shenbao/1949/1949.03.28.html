<h3>政府代表定期飛平　凖備充足資料不携方案臨時政務會議改明舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕政府和談長表團頃已推定張治中爲首席代表，並決於卅一日晨專機飛平，俾展開四月一日起在平舉行之商談。代表團赴平時，其商談原則係以毛澤東之八項條件爲基礎，除凖備充足之資料外，不携帶任何方案，卽政府前根據毛澤東八項條件所擬具之和平綱領，亦不用以參考。關於整軍方案部份，政府代表連日研討頗詳。廿七日晨十時何院長在國防部召集開會，討論關於目前國共雙方各戰塲之形勢及兵力部署等等，以便代表之暸解。下午四時李代總統復在傳厚崗宮邸召集何應欽及四代表討論其他各項問題，如解決「戰犯」之技術問題等等。代表團人士解外絕對保守秘密，惟根據記者向各代表探詢和談之態度時，彼等均有以次之透露：「希望是有的，但困難甚多，更可能於遭遇任何一問題時，卽不能繼續其商談」，前途之黯淡，似不可避免，但代表團仍有此決心，前往一試。又代表赴平時，每人可隨帶秘書及隨員各一，新聞記者或將被謝同行。又和談代表團秘書長，頃聞業已決定由虛郁文出任。因李梭龍，雷震均不在京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕何閣施政方針全案草擬尚未竣事，原定廿八日提交臨時政務會討論者，業已不及，政務會亦改廿九日下午舉行，其討論讓題徐施政方針外，並將決定和談代表團之組織人選及經費。按該國組織法業經前政院擬就，並已任命工作人員，惟頃經研究後，在組織上擬予以緊縮，工作人員亦將有變更。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕李代總統廿七日午在總統府宴請全體監委席上致詞，對於和談卽可開始表示甚爲欣慰，惟稱：和談之成功與否，尚有待於政府及各方面之努力。李代總統稱：和平爲全國人民一致之希望，人民再不堪忍受戰爭之苦，如誰不願和平，誰卽違反人民之意旨，相信中共亦不致不願意和平。李代總統並追述渠致力和平之經過，謂當一月底南京局勢最緊張危險之際，渠仍坐鎮南京，不願他往，最後終能使局勢趨於穩定。李代總統並稱：此次行政院改組，裁去八個部會，被併機構已告實現，現政府正向民主之途邁進，相信當可逐步付之實行。李代總統廿七日午宴全體監委時，于院長，劉副院長及監委九十餘人均應邀參加，李代總統致詞後，監委梁上棟曾起立致答詞。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕章士釗廿七日夜車自京赴滬，並決定於廿九日夜車返京，章氏曾以樂觀之語調答覆記者對和談態度之詢問。記者詢以此次赴平時，是否將首先討論雙方停戰一事，章氏稱：「在理論上是對的」。又黃紹竑定廿八日來京。</p>
<h3>和談前途如何？一般看法認達成協議有可能但不過爲間歇性的武裝休戰</h3>
<p>外記者的報道</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿七日電〕全中國廿七日正注視預定在四月一日開始的國共和談，希望中帶有疑慮許多人在問：「和平可能實現嗎？」就謹慎的觀察家而言，他們都對和平的前途加上一個問號，在目前，朝野人士都沒有一個敢確定地預測最後的結果，然而，就大多數人的內在感想而言，都有胡適博士的「和比戰難」之感，但一般認爲：若干形式的協議的可能性，並非他不存在，但卽使達成協議，充其量亦不過爲一種間歇性的武裝休戰而已，決不是永久性的和平，因爲中共固執於渠等的革命目標及政治理想，決不能容忍反對者，而僅能容忍合作者。一般均懷疑共產黨將能修正渠等的最後革命目標——肅清一切反對者而由一黨專政，目前的局勢，顯然已與馬歇爾調解時期不同，中共已爲和談的主宰者，渠等僅願在其本身的條件上停止戰爭，顯然政府並非不瞭解中共條件的苛刻，正如政府和談代表邵力子所稱：在中共堅持八項條件的時期中，和談前途並不光明。</p>
<p>但是，目前全國人民的渴望和平，顯爲促進和談的主力，政府和談代表張治中卽認爲，與論的力量，可能影響國共雙方恢復良知，解決二十年來的積怨以及政治上的歧見。國共雙方在其文告中固均承認民意望和，許多觀察家因認爲雙方顯然均不願擔負破壞和平的責任，蓋和談一旦開始壞和平的責任，蓋和談一旦開始，雙方均可能被認爲對和平有所貢獻。</p>
<h3>廈門華僑國團體促國共迅速和談</h3>
<p>〔本報廈門廿七日電〕國共和談卽將開始，此間華僑七團體站在華僑立塲，廿七日通電國共領袖李代總統及毛澤東，請雙方消隊歧見，迅卽和談，藉蘇民困，以慰僑情，並電海外僑胞一致主張，促成和談。</p>

<h3>爲調查東北救濟物資事　吳國楨被提糾舉　劉哲認爲傲慢失常有玷官箴</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕監察院副院長劉哲，前在滬爲東北救濟物資事與吳市長國楨發生爭議案，劉氏頃已以「咆哮無禮傲慢失常」爲詞，提出糾舉吳國楨案，惟尚未能審查成立，茲誌劉哲所提糾舉案之全文如次：</p>
<p>案由：上海市長吳國楨越組代庖，擅將東北留存關內物資清查處理委員會所存棉紗五百件抵押中央銀行，借款五千尤元，撥放東北難胞，並於本年二月廿六日在滬蘇浙區監察行署召開第二次調查會出席時，咆哮無法禮，傲慢失常，實屬違法失職，有玷官箴，擬依憲法九十七條第二項提出糾舉。</p>
<p>事實，（一）濫用職權，擅將東北清處會棉紗五百件抵押中央銀行，借款五千萬元，濫行發放。查本年二月九日東北難胞籲請領救濟金，齊集中央銀行，夜以繼日等候，該上海市長吳國楨遽以妨礙治安，影響公務爲由，擅將東北清處會棉紗五百件抵押中央銀行五千萬元，濫行發放，將真正老戌難胞隔離門外，致使多抱向隅。因之難胞復於二月十一十二兩日以集聚上海中國實業銀行及糧食緊急購儲會，而該市長吳國楨乃利用戒嚴法，派遣軍警，強制驅散。查該市長旣能派遣軍警強制驅散於中實銀行，爲何不採取同一辦法，施之於央行羣衆。假使東北清處會無法此項棉紗，又將何以處置。反之旣能於央行代爲押款發放，爲何竟於中國實業銀行及糧食購儲會集衆難胞，而強派軍警驅散，是其處置前後予盾，越組夫職，甚爲明顯。（二）氣勢傲慢，有失官箴，咆哮無法禮，妨礙本院職權。查本院於本年二月十五日院會推定劉哲等八監委調查此案，乃於二月六日午後三時，在滬蘇浙區監委行署召開第二次調查會，邀請對於該案有關人員出席時，該市長吳國楨竟遲至四時四十分，方始項圍毛巾，昂然入座。迨向說明邀請目的後，該吳國氣勢漁汹汹，大聲急呼，產先說此事不能越組代庖，嗣又連說此事多賴「楊綽庵助余」，「以棉紗助余」，「我算政治成功」；實屬咆哮無法禮，傲慢失常。及哲詢糧食購儲會主委楊綽庵此項棉紗是否發給市政府，抑由市府強索抵押借款。此時楊綽庵未及答完，該吳國楨卽行插言：「是市府強索，是市府強索」。哲謂然則是越組代庖矣。該吳國楨又言：「是越組代庖，是越組代庖。」前後語言予盾，氣熖不知高到如何地步，實屬渺視法紀，有玷官箴。竊以監察陸軍爲中華民國之監察院，非入監委個人之監察院，該吳國楨出席答辯案件，應如何安詳靜慎，細心研討，何以項圍毛巾，咆哮無法禮，傲慢失常。擬請函致行政院予以教訓申誡處分，俾該員以後稍歛驕傲之氣晉，養成國家有用之才，敬提案如右。提案人劉哲。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕監院廿六日第四十七次會議，推選馬良駿，哈的爾及沙拉哈尼姆三委員爲新疆區監察委員行署委員。</p>
<h3>共軍對江北各橋頭堡　可能再發動攻勢　俾爲其和談之最大助力</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕據某權威軍事觀察家談：共軍可能繼進軍安慶之後，向江北國軍其他橋頭堡發動攻勢，一方所以趁和談期問加深其軍事壓力，俾陳兵江岸，以爲其和談之最大助力，一方亦所以企圖於此時囊括江北各橋頭堡後，俾一旦和談破裂，卽可遂行其渡江陰謀。某觀察家繼談，共軍最客氣的辦法至多將首都對江之現金浦地區橋頭堡保留至最後攻撃，其他如儀徵·瓜洲·三江營·裕溪口等皆難免被攻，然該觀察家至此復謂，以上固皆爲共軍主觀的計劃與願望，目下國軍正已逐漸加強江北各橋頭陣地之實力。</p>
<p>〔本報常熟廿七日電〕蘇北情況益趨緊張，陳毅部隊續向江邊移動，靖泰地區發現野戰軍，南通靖江一帶木船集結甚夥，八圩港陣地仍安。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江廿七日電〕軍息：（一）儀徵·瓜洲·口岸當面今無法變化，國軍堅守原地。（二）蘇北方面之共軍華中野戰軍萬餘人，內有民伕七千餘人，昨由兩淮進抵揚州四郊。（三）陳毅部五個縱隊，刻已推進至靖江附近。八圩港附近國軍橋頭陣地今曾不斷發生斥堠戰，共軍并發砲示威。</p>

<h3>安慶海陸軍反攻　潛至江邊共軍悉數殲滅　鄂東陳賡部退集羅田西北構築工事</h3>
<p>〔本報蕪湖廿七日電〕安慶攻守戰自廿三日開始後，迄今雖已進入第四日，然城區迄在國軍固守中。國軍方面除原駐城區之四十六軍一七四師曁一部地方團隊及江上之兵艦二艘外，廿六日晨起，復有另一部強大海軍繼素稱饒勇善戰原係楊正子弟兵之楊幹才部開到，乃卽會同原有守軍向城外西據點展開猛烈反攻，激戰迄午，計斃傷共軍二千餘，俘百餘。午後起，國軍卽趁此調整部署，戰況暫轉沉寂，而共軍方面除原先發現屬陳賡建制之十一·十二等二個軍及一個基幹團外，廿六日晚起，於增援第廿一軍後，亦向國軍陣地猛烈來攻，經澈夜惡戰後，至廿七日晨終將其全部撃退。今午前後，共軍又自城之東西北三面發動總攻，其中一股約二三百人，且一度竄至從陽山（東門）丁家村問之江邊，然終賴海空與地面守軍所構成之立體火綱，卒將該股共軍全部殲滅。截至今晚八時止，國軍迄固守城郊東起斷塘湖，經五里墩·龍異廟·農業學校·鳳凰山，西迄石門湖之原陣地。又安慶對外電信交通仍暢達，昨今皆有輪隻自漢開出，經安慶東下。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕據海軍總部訊：安慶戰事仍激烈進行中，廿六日間因雨沉寂，晚起復轉激烈，迄廿七日晚未稍停止。廿七日午，共軍一部二百餘人，潛行竄抵東郊江邊，以江堤爲掩護，與江面停泊之海軍艦艇發生砲戰，共軍因海軍砲火猛烈，已將市郊封鎖，使之無法法進展，故潛至江邊企圖截撃海軍，經海軍發現目標後，卽以熾盛火綱將該部共軍悉數消滅。刻海軍艦艇仍發揮威力繼續支援守軍作戰。</p>

<h3>所謂世界和平大會</h3>
<p>美國藝術家，科學家，及職業人員協會所發起的文化科學界保衛世界和平大會，已於本月廿五日晚上在紐約開幕了。預定會期為三天，凡有關世界和平的問題，例如東西雙方的冷戰，馬歇爾的援歐計劃，原于能的管制問題，以及大西洋公約等等，均在討論之列。如果這次會議的目的，果真在集合世界各國的科學家，藝術家，教育家的智慧，探索出一條世界和平的康莊大道，當不失為今日國際間的一種和平運動。無如原發起人美國藝術家科學家及職業人員協會，在美國檢察官的調查統計的表冊內，向被列為共產陣綫的組織，各國的代表又多是左翼人物，在其開幕之前，蘇聯及其鐵幕以內的各國，紛紛通電擁護，極盡捧場的能事，因為立場一偏，就使人不能相信，這是一個純粹由民間發起而真能公正持平的一個世界和平大會了。美國務院曾率直指出，這一會議將為蘇聯宣傳開一方便之門；紐約州長杜威也說，這次會議是共產陣綫的事情。</p>
<p>所以，在這次會議開幕之前，為了美國拒絕若干國家的代表入境，曾引起國際上不愉快的情緒。到了大會開幕之後，又因美國右派人士的多方留難，甚至美國文化自由協會也在紐約開會，大唱其對台戲，頓使紐約也成為東西冷戰的宣傳戰場了。保衛和平大會本身先不和平，其結果不特對世界和平的維持毫無補益，恐將徒然增加國際上的紛擾。這為什麼弄到如此？恐怕最大的原因，還是缺少了偉大的宗教家參加，尤其缺少了「同體大悲」的佛教大德來躬行倡導的緣故。惟有以「平等　益一切眾生」為職志，以「我不入地獄誰入地獄」為誓願的佛菩薩的精神，才真能泯除國界，泯除種界，而締造一個充滿群和氣象的新世界。</p>
<p>但是話又得說回來。在國際氣壓低沉的今日，如果有人出來倡導和平，企圖集合全人類的意識以致力於保衛和平，不問他的動機何在，也不問他是否受人指使，而站在相互忍讓避免刀兵浩刧的大前提下，都是值得世人歡迎和鼓勵的。大會主席夏普萊說：「余以最謙虛的心情，來此提出一個簡單的問題，人類如何始能生存於和平之中？」美國政府當局明知此一會議的背後乃由共產國際所指使的，但仍允許這個會議在紐約如期開幕，聽任各國代表在會場中暢所欲言，這種民主的風度，真值得全世界愛好和平自由的人們所一致讚揚。我們更希望任何一個地區的政府，都能像美國一般，可以容許有自由公開的討論大會，民主與否就要從道些事例來判斷。我們站在第三者的立場，深盼各國與會代表均能平心靜氣地檢討世界問題癥結，以毋意毋必母固毋我的態度，激底互相交換意見，集合各人的智慧，真能替世界和平，探索出一條康莊的大道，千萬不可再　目前愈演愈烈的冷戰火上加油。我們認為保衛和平大會必須做到下列兩個先決條件，否則決不能視為今日國際間的和平運動。</p>
<p>第一，愒望和平，是世界各國人民的共同心理；締造公平永久的和平，更是世界各國人民的一致要求。即以美蘇兩國而言，不論兩國的思想如何不同，政制如何差別，利害如何衝突，雙方從事冷戰如何劇烈，但兩國人艮原本都是希望和平的，厭惡戰爭實在人同此心。其他國家的人民，三十年中受了兩次世界大戰的浩刧，更是「聞戰色變」。可是衡諸國際現狀，不必諱言，却向着戰爭的道路邁進，新的國際戰爭的危機日見迫切，大有一觸即發之勢，使任何一國的人民心理上莫不感受威脅。所以，在第三次世界大戰的危機日深之際，如果有人出來倡導和平，自是好事。不過，召開任何方式的國際和平會議，在他的本身就先應有祥和氣象。如果被人利用，作為宣傳攻勢，以致會議中先充滿了戾氣，則不僅對於世界和平毫無補益，反而更要造成國際間緊張的局勢。大會主席夏普萊教授曾表示，與會代表必能以「民主的傳統精神」來開會。我們要特別提醒各國代表，千萬勿忘發起人夏普萊教授的這一句金玉良言，否則這次大會勢必淪為去年八月在波蘭召開的世界知識份子大會的第二，不僅無補國際和平，反而要引起國際間的紛擾與爭議。</p>
<p>第二，戰後締造和平失敗的因素非常複雜，決非某一方面所單獨造成的。就是大會主席夏普萊，也承認美蘇對於目前的國際僵局均有過失。我們在美蘇兩國的宣傳戰之中，到處可以聽到雙方的推諉與責罵。在美國方面常常說，蘇聯的勢力不斷地向西歐，中東，遠東發展，大有無孔不入之勢，世界和平已受到共產勢力的威脅，如不設法防範，則西歐，中東，遠東各國均將淪入鐵幕之內了。因此，主張積極援助歐洲各國，並發起締結大西洋公約，以保持區域的安全。但在蘇聯方面則謂，美國是戰爭販子，以杜魯門主義和馬歇爾計劃來製造新的國際戰爭，此次大西洋公約的締結，更是領導世界走向戰爭。雙方言論，似乎公說公有理，婆說婆有理，真所謂「此一是非，彼「是非」。但若站在第三者的立場，真要說一句公道話，却也並不困難。只要雙方都有大政治家，都為全世界人類打算，放棄主觀的成見，不為小我的利害得失所蒙蔽，則在世界兩大集團之間，化戾氣為祥和，並非絕不可能。</p>
<p>世界上最講和平的人，當無過於虔誠的佛教徒。佛教最要緊的，勸人們「寃仇宜解不宜結」，果要解結，祇有勸勉疏導，而不能稱為裁判。世界和平大會若不從這點下手，而偏偏要以「公斷會」的方式，先來評論誰是誰非，吾恐名為保衛世界和平，而結果或反加深戰爭的危機。因此，我們更覺得在世界和平運動中，與其只憑西方人的思想方法，從法律觀念是非觀念去爭辯，不如多多糝入東方人的思想方法，從宗教家的立場，用慈悲精神去勸導有權威的政治家，來得有效。在中國國內的和談，其成功與否，也繫乎此。</p>

<h3>片面修改德國西部疆界　德人一致表示抗議　認為此舉違反大西洋憲章</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社海牙廿六日電〕據消息靈通人士稱：修正德國西疆之正式協定，今晚業已宣佈，然細節在二三週內不致公開，以避免走私活動及意外之居民遷延。據非官方訊，荷蘭方面行將修正之疆界，影響長達十數公里之區域，位於尼美根之東與錫托遠袋形區域中。此等修正僅在改正舊疆界中與道路及木道有關之若干不合理之所在。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿六日電〕法義兩國外長今日又同時簽署三件法義間之章約：一為商業草約，規定在歐洲經濟合作之機構成立後，將在其職權內成立具有限度之貿易關係。一為財政草約，規定法郎與里拉之折合率為一百法郎合一百八十里拉。一為在法義工人之工資如何折算問題。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿六日電〕英國半官方人士今夜對法義簽訂關稅同盟事，略感不安。彼等對此新協定將加強西歐各國之聯繫，且可促成軍事經濟之統一陣綫兩點，雖表歡迎，然認為最近成立之此種經濟集團，如荷比盧集團及法義集團，遲早將對英國之西歐貿易政策發生不良影響。</p>

<h3>法地方選舉二次投票　政府黨勝利具有把握</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿七日電〕此間觀察家今日預測今日舉行之第二次地方議會補缺選舉中，「第三種力量」（卽政府各黨派之聯合）將獲勝利。此次選舉將決定七百八十五個選舉區中之代表，以上各區在上星期日選舉時，未能產生代表。此次選舉時獲票最多者卽能當選。在多數選區中，競選者為共黨「第三各力量」故能在此選舉中戰勝極左極右兩派。</p>

<h3>滬西住宅區　竊黨出沒　舉止服裝儼然紳士　公館僕役易上圈套</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近本市西區住戶常遭竊黨光臨，其偷竊方式甚為巧妙。有某名流之子與同事一人同住於白賽仲路某公寓內，上週末當他們在中區辦公時，公寓內忽然來一西裝筆挺的男子，對傭婦說：某人在家否？傭婦當告以已離家去辦公。此人說：我是他的朋友，今天剛從香港來滬，我知道他辦公處的電話號碼，待我打一電話給他。說罷就取室　內電話撥講，傭婦見他持話筒與對方寒暄，狀甚熱絡。旣而，此人打畢電話，對傭人說：你主人會有中國航空公司的人送兩隻皮箱來，是我的東西，你替我收下。傭婦因他派頭一絡，又且與主人通過電話，乃</p>
<p>深信不疑　她想：主人尙未歸來，我應盡待客之職，就問此人道：可吃過東西否：答稱未吃，傭婦說：我去炒幾個蛋你吃吧。這樣，她就去廚房炒蛋，留下客人獨個兒在客室內。等到蛋炒好送與他呼畢，又坐了一會，此人忽然說：我有些事情，出去一下再來。走出門的時候，還再三叮囑傭婦皮箱送來時務必收下，傭婦唯唯應諾。不料此人就此一去不返，也沒有什麼皮箱送到。及等晚上某名流之子返家，傭婦告以此事，某甚為驚訝，因根本日間並無從香港來的友人打電話給他，但亦不以為意。一宿無話，及至次晨起床　洗室刷牙時，發覺廚內牙膏兩罐失蹤，又見有照相機及套塞在廚內，乃急至臥室內檢點，則一架康鐵克斯及一架羅萊弗萊克斯照相機均已不翼而飛，桌上鬧鐘及抽屜內零錢亦均被竊矣。又日前西區某住宅內</p>
<p>主人外出　時，門口忽然駛來一輛汽車，車中一男一女，男的西裝革履，一副紳士派頭，女的灰鼠大衣，雍容華貴。當時男的下車來問：某人在家否？傭婦答以均已外出，此人表示頗為失望，及見室內有小孩在遊嬉，乃對小孩說：你還認得我嗎？當下就乘機坐下，嘻皮笑臉的逗小孩玩耍。坐了一會，忽然眉峯緊蹙，說是肚子痛了，並說這幾天正患痢疾，必須立刻如廁。傭婦當卽領他到樓上廁所內大便，幾分鐘後便畢下樓，仍與小孩閒逗，隔了一會忽然肚子又痛了，這一回他自己上樓到廁所去了，傭婦沒有陪他。及等下樓後，又坐了一回，</p>
<p>登車而去　當晚主人回家，發覺臥室抽屜內的幾十元美金，一隻戒子，以及其他一些零碎東西都被竊了。類似這一種方式的偷竊，據說西區住戶遇到的已不少，竊黨們對於行竊對象的住戶姓名，以及他們的生活情形，探聽得非常清楚，才乘了他們不在家的時候，來行使竊騙技倆。一般上等家庭的傭婦，對於這類衣冠楚楚堂而皇之的竊賊，著實要留意提防呢</p>

<h3>中航苦戰失三城　鐵路躍登新寶座　風和日麗逸園球塲萬頭攢動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本屆足球聯賽新盟主，業於昨日產生，鐵路隊在爆竹擊中以三比零克服中航，完成本年傑作。</p>
<p>全塲比賽，中航攻勝於守，而鐵路則守優於攻，故雙方戰來，可調半斤八兩。中航前鋒有一高秀淸，經鐵路後衛百一國腳高保正，一攻一守，兩隊特點，適成「軋平」。鐵路雖云淨嬴三球，論實際祗是第三球可稱眞材實料。蓋中航之負第一二兩球，一轍在二十碼罰球，二輸在自己擺烏龍，若非第三球之輸得「石板鐵硬」，我眞將爲中航呌屈也。</p>
<p>再論昨日之決戰，雖日不够精彩水準，但緊張刺激則有之。在此冷寂之上海足球圈內，尙不失爲一塲尙可過濾之球戲。是日因天氣晴朗，陽光初見，觀衆更鑒於足球季行將完了，故逸園呈空前鬧猛，數達一萬餘人。</p>
<p>賽畢，當塲由市長代表張彼得舉行給獎禮。昨日門券售出一千二百元券一一四六張，八百元券四〇四六張，共收入四百六十一萬二千元。裁判員張樂，巡邊員倪孝本陸順德。</p>
<p>昨賽於三時開始，中航開球，進攻遇刦截回，鐵路大軍雲集中航腹地，術受蹂躪，謝錫川不愼犯規，蕭子文主罰任意球，力叩入網，一對零奪得先聲。中航心有未甘，傾師出犯，徐祖國十五碼處低射，未奏膚功，高秀淸突入力射，球中橫木彈下，廖雄正待接住，殷慶炳如飛而至，當面一撞，被判犯規，罰出未幾，殷慶炳大腳吊中，徐祖國閃入，奈差之毫厘，又成泡影，酣鬥多時，殷慶炳帶球上前，高保正迎面一撞，殷受傷倒地，離塲調治，上半時於焉吿終。　擰檬啖罷，重披戰袍，中航金家標請纓助戰，替出商華均，鐵路愈戰愈勇，中航初顯不支，徐祖國陳宇偉互易位置，但仍無補大局，鐵路伺隙環攻，中航禁區險象叢生，鐵路中間三鋒連轡進襲，徐福生衝出，金川瀚巧擺華容道，吳炳浩福至心靈，一碰入網，二對零拾着外快。中航漸成强弩之末，雖作困獸之鬥，但已屈居下風。卅六分鐘時，吳炳浩得機傳中，陸慶祥頭上擺渡，張傑臥地一鏟，三對零又陷一城。此後戰局漸成尾聲，銀笛鳴處，鐵路以三球之差，攖得市長盃。</p>

<h3>綠隊兩擒勁敵黎隊　獨覇女兒國　回力竿頭直上又勝培斐爾</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽昨晚節目頗具號召力，觀衆當在三千人左右。女子組主力戰綠隊再克黎隊四八比卅一，七戰七勝，表演霸主威風。甲一組回力勝培斐爾亦屬一塲狠鬥，結果五六比四五，上半時卅比十八。回力連勝三塲，有竿頭直上之勢。甲二A東華勝又一，六十四比四十二。</p>
<p>回力五分鐘內即以十比四立下馬威，使洋兵疲於奔波，王永芳田福海的夾攻，上半時已創下基業，下半時培斐爾欲開快車，已無能爲力矣。</p>
<p>綠隊對黎隊女子組主力戰，第一節黎隊後衛各守防區，使綠隊頗難進取，且雙方好像都有些不正常。第二節以後，綠隊即平均發展，黎隊錢楚屏雖奪獲廿三分之多，仍不免再行低頭。</p>
<p>又一東華甲二A的一塲，有着輕鬆的情調，又一在必輸的狀態下還是不慌不忙。東華巳四戰全勝。</p>

<h3>評鐵中之戰</h3>
<p>— 球史公</p>
<p>市長盃決賽一再而因雨延期，昨日午後終於演出，吸引觀衆一萬餘人，中航賽初鬥志彌堅，後防因莊文權之來歸，更形鞏固，前鋒速度可嘉，但弱在中衛綫，母論助攻助守，都力有朱逮，金川瀚演出在水準以上，且相當賣力，可謂已經克盡厥責，但所失第二球，不得辭其咎，陳効平足傷未癒，力疾從公，但因此受到影響，速度紆緩，商華均尙稱職，下半時換上金家標，甫目電慶回來，因之球路生疏，上半時小高及殷慶炳不斷回防帶球，所以還不十分顯得出中衛綫中斷之現象，下半時殷慶炳受傷後，活動力大打折扣，小高亦顯力竭，乃見前後晚節。李順生及陳宇偉之兩翼，尙須多加琢磨。平心而論，中航所負三球，都是不應該輸而輸的，第一球由蕭子文主罰任意球，徐福生位置偏右，不防蕭子文疾射左方，先失一城，因之影響將士鬥志。第二球乃由金川瀚與徐福生誤會所致，金以爲徐會衝出來，而徐未曾，到徐福生衝出，金川瀚偏偏以腹部一碰，徐福生一把未曾撈着，吳炳浩跟進一碰，拾着外快。第三球顯出鐵路諸鋒合作有默契，但亦由於中航傾師出犯，後防疏漏所致。下半時陳宇偉與徐祖國互易位置，一無裨益，反而中間一點威脅都沒有了。</p>
<p>綜觀兩隊戰力，自以鐵路較爲堅强，但盃賽往往會發生奇蹟，靑白慘遭淘汰，即屬此例，但中航前鋒除可能以速度制勝外，別無他途，高秀淸爲其中翹楚，殷慶炳有時表演出衆，有時黯然無色，猶憶去年全運時，殷代表海軍，與香港對壘，由渠獨中一球，直至終塲前五分鐘，方由港方扳成和局，於加時中方擊退海軍，該賽殷特別卯上，但未能保持常態，假使勤練不輟，前途有望。門將徐福生演出甚佳，若非由其分外努力，中航所負恐尙不止此數。</p>
<p>鐵路廖雄特別出色，數度救出必中之球，自是可兒，高保正坐鎭中央，使胡騎難渡陰山，中後衛綫均有穩健之演出，中間三鋒，動作有默契，推進迅速，常以扇形攻勢突入敵陣，蕭子文一罰定天山，張傑之竄時，陸慶祥之盤傳，俱見上乘，美中不足者，在於兩翼較弱，吳炳浩僅速度不够，老路猶存，林典羲則祇有直綫上前一腳傳向門前之功夫而已，昨賽林曾有一次在門前僅七八碼，竟未能建功，當機遲疑不決，最犯大忌。全隊氣力充沛，久戰不倦，合作有素，此番靑白意外覆師，因此加强鐵路健兒之信心，得以取得市長盃，聯甲次循賽中，如靑白諸將不加振作，兩雄相逢，直未卜鹿死誰手也。</p>

<h3>嘉桐公路覆車案　司機包油制肇禍　女客鄭珠玲罹難</h3>
<p>〔本報嘉興廿五日訊〕嘉桐公路客車會於本年一月十日談生覆車慘劇，本月十七日竟再度發生同樣事件，前者當場壓斃乘客徐學楚等二人，後者有女客鄭玲珠一人罹難，兩案相隔僅六十八日，而肇禍原因均為客車司機駕駛不慎所致。徐案司機李四賓畏罪潛逃，迄未弋獲，鄭案司機李幼海則已由桐鄉縣警察局扣押，現正由縣司法處偵訊中。但省公路局對此兩慘案迄無表示，且聞該局連日向各方積極活動，擬為壁肇禍司機開脫。禾桐兩地居民聞訊，極表憤慨，認為六十八天中連續發生覆車慘案，省公路局不思飭戒汽車司機，不思澈底翻修路面，不思改進車輛，祗知為本身圖利，如此草菅民命，除司機本身業務上過失致人於死之刑事責任外，省公路局當局實感負徐鄭兩慘案之全部責任。現聞桐鄉縣黨部車書記長同輪，朱議長汾及死難旅客家屬徐學栓，鄭國長等，正發起組織徐鄭慘案後援會，並親定期赴杭州自浙江省府。公路局?交通部辦事處。高等法院等各有關機關請顯，同時並收集十七日覆車詳情，提供事賞證據，向各界呼籲，要求主持正義。據悉：此次出事地點並非橋換而係寬約四五公尺之平坦公路道旁，檢視該傾覆之汽車機件亦屬完好，肇事原因顯係駕駛不慎，行車過速所致。聞省公路局對所屬客車司機採包油制，即車行每公里給汽油多少，有餘歸入司機私囊，不足由司機自行貼補，因此司機開車儘量提高速度，並時時關油門放空檔使汽車滑行，以節省汽油，此為肇禍之最大原因。</p>

<h3>Government Representatives to Fly to Beiping Regularly – Prepared with Sufficient Materials, No Plans Carried, Provisional Government Affairs Conference Postponed to Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] The government's delegation for peace talks has recently appointed Zhang Zhizhong as the chief representative and decided to fly to Beiping by special plane on the morning of the 31st to begin negotiations in Beiping starting on April 1st. Regarding the principles for negotiation when the delegation goes to Beiping, they will be based on Mao Zedong's eight conditions. In addition to preparing sufficient materials, they will not carry any plans; even the peace outline previously formulated by the government based on Mao Zedong's eight conditions will not be used for reference. Regarding the military reorganization plan, the government representatives have been discussing it in detail for several days. At 10:00 AM on the 27th, Premier He convened a meeting at the Ministry of National Defense to discuss the current situation on the various battlefields between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the deployment of forces, etc., so that the representatives can understand. At 4:00 PM, Acting President Li also convened He Yingqin and the four representatives at the Chuanhougang Mansion to discuss other issues, such as resolving the technical issues of "war criminals," etc. The delegation members maintain absolute secrecy externally. However, when reporters inquired about the representatives' attitude towards the peace talks, they all revealed the following: "There is hope, but there are many difficulties, and it is even possible that the negotiations cannot continue when any problem is encountered." The bleakness of the future seems unavoidable, but the delegation is still determined to give it a try. In addition, when the representatives go to Beiping, each person can bring one secretary and one attendant. News reporters may be declined to accompany. Furthermore, it is recently heard that Xu Yuwen has been decided to be the Secretary-General of the Peace Talks Delegation because Li Suolong and Lei Zhen are not in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] The drafting of Premier He's overall administrative policy plan has not yet been completed. It was originally scheduled to be submitted to the Provisional Government Affairs Conference for discussion on the 28th, but it is already too late. The Government Affairs Conference has also been changed to be held on the afternoon of the 29th. In addition to discussing Premier Xu's administrative policy at the meeting, the organization, personnel, and funding of the peace talks delegation will also be determined. According to the National Organization Law, which was drafted by the former Executive Yuan and has already appointed staff, after research, it is planned to tighten the organization and change the staff.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] Acting President Li hosted a banquet for all members of the Control Yuan at the Presidential Palace on the afternoon of the 27th. In his speech, he expressed great satisfaction that the peace talks could begin soon, but said: The success of the peace talks depends on the efforts of the government and all parties. Acting President Li said: Peace is the unanimous hope of the people of the whole country. The people can no longer endure the suffering of war. If anyone does not want peace, they are violating the will of the people. He believes that the Chinese Communist Party will not be unwilling to have peace either. Acting President Li also recounted his efforts for peace, saying that when the situation in Nanjing was most tense and dangerous at the end of January, he still remained in Nanjing and was unwilling to go elsewhere, and finally was able to stabilize the situation. Acting President Li also said: This reorganization of the Executive Yuan, with the abolition of eight ministries and commissions and the merging of institutions, has been realized. The current government is moving towards democracy and believes that it can be gradually implemented. When Acting President Li hosted a banquet for all members of the Control Yuan on the afternoon of the 27th, Premier Yu, Deputy Premier Liu, and more than 90 members of the Control Yuan were invited to participate. After Acting President Li's speech, Control Yuan member Liang Shangdong stood up to give a response.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] Zhang Shizhao took the night train from Nanjing to Shanghai on the 27th and decided to return to Nanjing by night train on the 29th. Zhang replied to reporters' inquiries about his attitude towards the peace talks in an optimistic tone. When reporters asked whether the two sides would first discuss a ceasefire during this trip to Beiping, Zhang said: "In theory, it is right." Huang Shaohong is scheduled to come to Nanjing on the 28th.</p>
<h3>What is the Future of Peace Talks? General Opinion Believes That Reaching an Agreement is Possible, But it Will Only be an Intermittent Armed Truce</h3>
<p>Reports from Foreign Correspondents</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] All of China is watching the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks scheduled to begin on April 1st, with hope mixed with doubt. Many people are asking: "Is peace possible?" As far as cautious observers are concerned, they all put a question mark on the future of peace. At present, no one in the government or the opposition dares to predict the final outcome with certainty. However, as far as the inner feelings of most people are concerned, they all have Dr. Hu Shi's feeling that "peace is more difficult than war." However, it is generally believed that the possibility of some form of agreement is not non-existent, but even if an agreement is reached, at best it will only be a kind of intermittent armed truce, and it will never be permanent peace, because the Chinese Communist Party stubbornly adheres to its revolutionary goals and political ideals, and can only tolerate cooperators, not opponents. It is generally suspected that the Communist Party will be able to revise its final revolutionary goal—to eliminate all opponents and implement one-party dictatorship. The current situation is obviously different from the Marshall mediation period. The Chinese Communist Party is the master of the peace talks, and they are only willing to stop the war on their own terms. Obviously, the government is not unaware of the harshness of the Communist Party's conditions, just as Shao Lizi, the government's peace talk representative, said: During the period when the Communist Party insisted on the eight conditions, the future of the peace talks was not bright.</p>
<p>However, the current nationwide desire for peace is the main force in promoting peace talks. Zhang Zhizhong, the government's peace talk representative, believes that the power of public opinion may influence both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to restore their conscience and resolve the accumulated grievances and political differences of the past 20 years. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have acknowledged the people's desire for peace in their communiqués. Many observers therefore believe that both sides are clearly unwilling to bear the responsibility for destroying peace. Once peace talks begin, both sides may be considered to have contributed to peace.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Organizations in Xiamen Urge Kuomintang and Communist Party to Hold Peace Talks Quickly</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xiamen, 27th] The Kuomintang-Communist peace talks are about to begin. Standing from the perspective of overseas Chinese, the seven overseas Chinese organizations here telegraphed Kuomintang and Communist leaders, Acting President Li and Mao Zedong, on the 27th, requesting both sides to eliminate differences and hold peace talks quickly to relieve the people's difficulties and comfort the overseas Chinese. They also telegraphed overseas Chinese compatriots to unanimously advocate for the success of the peace talks.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Visits the Mausoleum</h3>
<p>And Climbs the High Tower of the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] Yu Youren, who has announced his resignation as President of the Control Yuan, visited the mausoleum on the afternoon of the 27th in the rare good weather in Nanjing in nearly a month, saying: "I told you long ago that I was going to resign. You still didn't believe it, but now I have resigned, haven't I?" Yu Youren also climbed the high tower of the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, striding up the steps. It is said that he has not climbed this tower for 20 years.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li's Wife Receives Female Members of the Legislative and Control Yuans</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Ms. Guo Dejie, wife of Acting President Li, held a tea party at the International Friendship Association at 4:00 PM on the 27th to receive female members of the Legislative and Control Yuans. More than 30 people were present. In her speech, Ms. Li emphasized the importance of peace. She said that political reform, people's livelihood construction, and other items cannot be successful without peace. She also urged female members of the Legislative and Control Yuans to jointly promote the early implementation of peace. Afterwards, Control Yuan member Cui Zhenhua and others spoke. The tea party lasted about 40 minutes and ended happily.</p>
<h3>Remuneration of Public School Teachers and Staff Will Be Adjusted Rationally</h3>
<p>Principles Still Awaiting Discussion by the Government Affairs Conference</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] The remuneration of public school teachers and staff will be adjusted rationally. This is Premier He's determination from the beginning of his tenure. The adjustment method has been researched by the Comptroller General, but Mr. Pang needs to receive the price indices from various places at the end of the month before he can determine the principles for adjusting various places. Therefore, it will not be possible to submit it at the Provisional Government Affairs Conference on the 29th. It will have to be discussed at the weekly meeting next week at the earliest.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Garrison Commander - Lu Daoyuan Promoted</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 27th] The Wuhan Garrison Command is actively undergoing reorganization. Commander Zhang Zhen has been approved to resign from his concurrent position as Garrison Commander. The vacancy will be filled by Deputy Commander Lu Daoyuan. The position of Chief of Staff is still held by Xi Mengtao. The internal organization has been strengthened compared to before. Currently, Zhang and Lu are going through the handover procedures.</p>
<h3>Communist Side Claims Full Connection of the Northern Section of the Jinpu Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Communist Radio broadcasted news from Tianjin on the 27th: The two sections of the Jinpu Railway from Tianjin to Dezhou and from Dezhou to Jinan have been connected on the 21st and 24th of this month respectively. By this point, the northern section of the Jinpu Line has been fully connected. In addition, passenger and freight transportation between Tianjin and Changxian will be officially restored from the 28th.</p>
<h3>Red Spear Society in the Henan-Hubei Border Area Coagulates into a Unified Fighting Force</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xinyang, 27th] The Red Spear Society in 57 counties in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border area has been transformed from a disorganized group into a unified self-defense fighting force. It is reported that in order to encourage people to defend themselves, the authorities have allowed them to automatically rectify their names and reorganize into the Peasants' Self-Defense Army. First, a general team including members of both the Red and Yellow Societies was established, with seven branch teams under it. The commander of the Henan Southern Peasants' Self-Defense Army is Wu Shaotang, who is the head of the Red Society.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Arrives in Changsha Yesterday - According to Discussions, the Communist Army is Very Likely to Cross the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changsha, 27th] Bai Chongxi arrived in Changsha at 10:00 AM on the 27th with Zhen Mingren. All the important party, government, and military officials below Cheng Qian gathered at the station to welcome him. Bai Chongxi stayed at the provincial government building and then met with reporters to discuss: (1) This trip is purely to visit Changsha and pay a visit to Director Cheng. He said he was not clear about the Xiangxi incident. (2) The Communist Army has recently approached the Yangtze River and is very likely to cross the river. (3) After the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, the quality of the National Army has improved, and morale is also high. (4) He sincerely hopes that the peace talks will succeed, but if the eight conditions proposed by the Communist Party cannot be compromised, the future is not optimistic. Bai Chongxi emphasized that from now on, military officers must ensure that personnel matters are open, finances are open, and opinions are open. Bai Chongxi attended a banquet hosted by Director Cheng in the evening and returned to Hankou by the original train at 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 27th] Bai Chongxi took the night train to Hunan last night to meet with Chairman Cheng Qian to discuss the joint defense of Hunan and Hubei. He is scheduled to return to Hankou tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Wu Guozhen Impeached for Investigating Relief Supplies in the Northeast - Liu Zhe Believes He is Arrogant and Erratic, Tainting Official Morality</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] Liu Zhe, Vice President of the Control Yuan, previously had a dispute with Mayor Wu Guozhen in Shanghai regarding relief supplies in the Northeast. Liu has recently filed an impeachment case against Wu Guozhen for "roaring, being rude, arrogant, and erratic." However, it has not yet been established. The full text of Liu Zhe's impeachment case is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Case: Mayor of Shanghai Wu Guozhen overstepped his authority and arbitrarily mortgaged 500 pieces of cotton yarn stored by the Committee for the Inventory and Disposal of Materials Remaining in the Interior from the Northeast at the Central Bank, borrowing 50 million yuan to allocate to refugees in the Northeast. On February 26 of this year, when attending the second investigation meeting convened by the Supervisory Office of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in Shanghai, he roared without etiquette, was arrogant and erratic, which is a violation of law and dereliction of duty, and taints official morality. It is proposed to file an impeachment in accordance with Article 97, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Facts: (1) Abuse of power, arbitrarily mortgaging 500 pieces of cotton yarn from the Northeast Inventory and Disposal Committee at the Central Bank, borrowing 50 million yuan, and arbitrarily distributing it. On February 9 of this year, refugees from the Northeast appealed for relief funds, gathered at the Central Bank, waiting day and night. Mayor Wu Guozhen of Shanghai suddenly claimed that it was disrupting public order and affecting official duties, and arbitrarily mortgaged 500 pieces of cotton yarn from the Northeast Inventory and Disposal Committee at the Central Bank for 50 million yuan, and arbitrarily distributed it, isolating the real old and weak refugees outside the door, causing many to leave empty-handed. As a result, the refugees gathered at the China Industrial Bank of Shanghai and the Grain Emergency Procurement and Storage Association on February 11 and 12. Mayor Wu Guozhen used martial law and dispatched military police to forcibly disperse them. Since the mayor was able to dispatch military police to forcibly disperse them at the China Industrial Bank, why did he not take the same approach and apply it to the crowd at the Central Bank? If the Northeast Inventory and Disposal Committee could not dispose of this cotton yarn, what would be done? Conversely, since he was able to mortgage and distribute funds on behalf of the Central Bank, why did he forcibly disperse the refugees gathered at the China Industrial Bank and the Grain Procurement and Storage Association, sending military police? His handling is contradictory and oversteps his authority, which is very obvious. (2) Arrogant demeanor, loss of official morality, roaring without etiquette, obstructing the authority of this Yuan. This Yuan convened Liu Zhe and other eight Control Yuan members on February 15 to investigate this case. On February 6, at 3:00 PM, the second investigation meeting was convened at the Supervisory Office of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in Shanghai, inviting relevant personnel to attend. Mayor Wu Guozhen was as late as 4:40 PM, wearing a towel and entering the room arrogantly. After explaining the purpose of the invitation, Wu Guozhen's attitude was fierce, and he shouted loudly, first saying that this matter could not overstep his authority, and then repeatedly said that this matter relied on "Yang Chuoan's help for me," "using cotton yarn to help me," and "I consider it a political success"; it was truly roaring without etiquette, arrogant and erratic. When I asked Yang Chuoan, chairman of the Grain Procurement and Storage Association, whether this cotton yarn was issued to the municipal government or forcibly demanded by the municipal government for mortgage loans, before Yang Chuoan could finish answering, Wu Guozhen interrupted and said: "It was forcibly demanded by the municipal government, it was forcibly demanded by the municipal government." I said that it was overstepping his authority. Wu Guozhen also said: "It is overstepping his authority, it is overstepping his authority." The language was contradictory before and after, and the anger was unknown to what extent, it was truly disregarding the law and disciplining, and tarnishing official morality. I believe that the Control Yuan is the Control Yuan of the Republic of China, not the Control Yuan of individual Control Yuan members. How should Wu Guozhen attend the case and answer the defense, calmly and carefully study it, why wear a towel, roar without etiquette, be arrogant and erratic. It is proposed to send a letter to the Executive Yuan to give him a lesson and a reprimand, so that he can slightly restrain his arrogance in the future and cultivate a talent useful to the country. Respectfully proposed as right. Proposer: Liu Zhe.</p>

<h3>Communist Army May Launch Another Offensive Against the Bridgeheads North of the Yangtze River - To Provide the Greatest Assistance to Their Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] According to a certain authoritative military observer, the Communist Army may launch an offensive against other National Army bridgeheads north of the Yangtze River after advancing into Anqing. On the one hand, they want to deepen their military pressure during the peace talks, so that they can station troops on the banks of the Yangtze River to provide the greatest assistance to their peace talks. On the other hand, they also want to include all the bridgeheads north of the Yangtze River at this time so that they can carry out their conspiracy to cross the Yangtze River once the peace talks break down. The observer continued to say that the most polite approach of the Communist Army would be to reserve the bridgehead in the Jinpu area across the Yangtze River from the capital for the final attack. Others such as Yizheng, Guazhou, Sanjiangying, and Yuxikou will inevitably be attacked. However, the observer added that the above are all subjective plans and wishes of the Communist Army. Currently, the National Army is gradually strengthening the strength of the bridgehead positions north of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changshu, 27th] The situation in northern Jiangsu is becoming increasingly tense. Chen Yi's troops continue to move towards the Yangtze River. Field troops have been discovered in the Jintai area. A large number of wooden boats have gathered in the Nantong-Jingjiang area. The Bajianggang position is still safe.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 27th] Military News: (1) There is no change in the situation facing Yizheng, Guazhou, and the port. The National Army is firmly defending its original position. (2) More than 10,000 Communist troops from the Central China Field Army in northern Jiangsu, including more than 7,000 civilian laborers, arrived in the suburbs of Yangzhou from Lianghuai yesterday. (3) Five columns of Chen Yi's troops have now advanced to the vicinity of Jingjiang. Sniping battles have occurred continuously near the National Army bridgehead position near Bajianggang. The Communist Army has also fired artillery to demonstrate.</p>

<h3>Anqing Navy and Army Counterattack - Communist Troops Who Sneaked to the Riverbank Completely Annihilated - Chen Geng's Troops in Eastern Hubei Retreat to Luotian Northwest to Build Fortifications</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Wuhu, 27th] The Anqing offensive and defensive battle has entered its fourth day since it began on the 23rd, but the urban area is still firmly defended by the National Army. In addition to the 174th Division of the 46th Army and some local teams stationed in the urban area and two warships on the river, another strong navy force, formerly known as Yang Zheng's troops, which has always been known for its bravery and good fighting, Yang Gancai's troops, arrived on the morning of the 26th and immediately launched a fierce counterattack on the western strongholds outside the city in conjunction with the original garrison. The fierce battle lasted until noon, killing and wounding more than 2,000 Communist troops and capturing more than 100. From the afternoon onwards, the National Army took the opportunity to adjust its deployment, and the battle situation temporarily turned silent. In addition to the two armies of the 11th and 12th Corps and a backbone regiment originally found to belong to Chen Geng's establishment, the Communist Army also launched a fierce attack on the National Army's positions after reinforcing the 21st Army on the evening of the 26th. After a night of fierce fighting, they were finally repelled completely on the morning of the 27th. Around noon today, the Communist Army launched a general attack from the east, west, and north sides of the city. One group of about 200 to 300 people even sneaked to the riverbank at Dingjia Village (East Gate) of Congyang Mountain, but ultimately relied on the three-dimensional fire network formed by the navy and air force and the ground garrison, and completely annihilated the group of Communist troops. As of 8:00 PM tonight, the National Army has firmly defended its original positions from Duantang Lake in the east of the city, passing through Wulidun, Longyimiao, Agricultural School, and Phoenix Mountain, to Shimen Lake in the west. In addition, Anqing's external telecommunications and transportation are still smooth. Ships have departed from Hankou and headed east through Anqing both yesterday and today.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] According to the Navy Headquarters, the Anqing battle is still in intense progress. It was silent due to rain on the 26th, but it turned fierce again in the evening and has not stopped as of the evening of the 27th. At noon on the 27th, a group of more than 200 Communist troops sneaked to the riverbank in the eastern suburbs, using the river embankment as cover, and engaged in artillery battles with naval vessels parked on the river. The Communist troops were blocked from advancing into the city due to the fierce naval artillery fire. Therefore, they sneaked to the riverbank in an attempt to intercept the navy. After the navy discovered the target, it completely wiped out the Communist troops with a fierce fire network. Currently, naval vessels are still exerting their power to continue to support the garrison's operations.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Huangpi, 27th] Military News: The 13th Army of the 4th Corps of Chen Geng's troops, which was defeated and retreated from Macheng, shot dead a regimental commander surnamed Li who had fought ineffectively when it retreated to Gaojiadian, 55 li southeast of Macheng, yesterday. According to a report from returned prisoners, the regimental commander was a member who had carried weapons and surrendered to the Communist Army from the National Army's position south of Xuzhou. It is also learned that most of the Communist troops have retreated to the Luotian northwest area to build fortifications, and they do not seem to have forgotten Macheng.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The So-Called World Peace Congress</h3>
<p>The Congress for World Peace, initiated by the American Association of Artists, Scientists, and Professional Personnel, opened in New York on the evening of the 25th of this month. The scheduled duration is three days, and issues concerning world peace, such as the Cold War between the East and West, the Marshall Plan for European aid, the control of atomic energy, and the Atlantic Pact, are all on the agenda for discussion. If the purpose of this meeting is truly to gather the wisdom of scientists, artists, and educators from various countries around the world to explore a broad path to world peace, it would undoubtedly be a kind of peace movement of international significance today. However, the original initiator, the American Association of Artists, Scientists, and Professional Personnel, has been listed as an organization of the communist front in the investigation and statistical records of the US Attorney General. The representatives of various countries are mostly left-wing figures. Before its opening, the Soviet Union and the countries within its iron curtain sent telegrams of support, going to great lengths to promote it. Because of this biased stance, people cannot believe that this is a truly impartial world peace congress purely initiated by the people. The US State Department has frankly pointed out that this meeting will open a convenient door for Soviet propaganda; New York Governor Dewey also said that this meeting is a matter of the communist front.</p>
<p>Therefore, before the opening of this meeting, the US refusal to allow representatives from certain countries to enter caused unpleasant emotions internationally. After the opening of the congress, the many difficulties caused by right-wing figures in the United States, and even the American Committee for Cultural Freedom holding a counter-meeting in New York, made New York a propaganda battlefield for the East-West Cold War. The congress for defending peace is itself not peaceful. As a result, it will not only be of no help to maintaining world peace, but it may also only increase international disturbances. Why has it come to this? The biggest reason is probably the lack of participation of great religious figures, especially the lack of Buddhist virtues of "great compassion for all beings" who can personally advocate for it. Only the spirit of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who take "equality and benefit to all sentient beings" as their vocation and "if I don't go to hell, who will?" as their vow can truly eliminate national boundaries, eliminate racial boundaries, and create a new world full of harmony.</p>
<p>However, let's get back to the point. In today's low international pressure, if someone comes out to advocate for peace, attempting to gather the consciousness of all mankind to work towards defending peace, regardless of their motives or whether they are being directed by others, and standing on the premise of mutual tolerance and avoiding the catastrophe of war, they are worthy of welcome and encouragement from the world. Congress Chairman Shapley said: "I come here with the most humble heart to ask a simple question: How can humanity live in peace?" The US government authorities, knowing that this meeting is directed behind the scenes by the Comintern, still allowed the meeting to open as scheduled in New York, allowing representatives from various countries to speak freely in the meeting. This democratic demeanor is truly worthy of praise by peace-loving and freedom-loving people all over the world. We hope that the government of any region can be like the United States, allowing free and open discussion conferences. Whether or not it is democratic should be judged from these examples. Standing on the sidelines, we sincerely hope that the representatives of all countries can calmly review the crux of world problems, and with an attitude of "no preconceived notions, no absolute judgments, no stubbornness, no ego," thoroughly exchange opinions, gather the wisdom of all people, and truly explore a broad path to world peace, and by no means add fuel to the increasingly fierce Cold War. We believe that the Congress for the Defense of Peace must meet the following two prerequisites, otherwise, it cannot be regarded as a peace movement of international significance today.</p>
<p>First, the desire for peace is the common psychology of the people of all countries in the world; creating a fair and lasting peace is the unanimous demand of the people of all countries in the world. Even in the case of the United States and the Soviet Union, no matter how different the ideologies of the two countries, how different the political systems, how conflicting the interests, and how intense the Cold War between the two sides, the people of both countries originally hoped for peace, and aversion to war is truly a common sentiment. The people of other countries, having suffered the catastrophe of two world wars in thirty years, are even more "pale at the mention of war." However, judging from the current international situation, it must be admitted that it is moving towards the road to war, and the crisis of a new international war is becoming increasingly urgent, with a tendency to erupt at any moment, making the psychology of the people of any country feel threatened. Therefore, at a time when the crisis of a third world war is deepening, it is a good thing if someone comes out to advocate for peace. However, convening any form of international peace conference should have a peaceful atmosphere in itself. If it is used as a propaganda offensive, so that the meeting is filled with violence, it will not only be of no help to world peace, but will also create a tense international situation. Congress Chairman Shapley has stated that the representatives will be able to hold the meeting in the "spirit of democratic tradition." We would like to especially remind the representatives of all countries to never forget this golden rule of the initiator, Professor Shapley, otherwise, this congress will inevitably become a second World Congress of Intellectuals held in Poland last August, which will not only be of no help to international peace, but will also cause international disputes and controversies.</p>
<p>Second, the factors for the failure of creating peace after the war are very complex, and they are by no means caused solely by one aspect. Even Congress Chairman Shapley admits that the United States and the Soviet Union are both at fault for the current international stalemate. In the propaganda war between the United States and the Soviet Union, we can hear the mutual shirking and blame everywhere. On the American side, it is often said that the Soviet Union's power is constantly developing to Western Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East, with a tendency to be omnipresent, and world peace has been threatened by communist forces. If measures are not taken to prevent it, Western Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East will fall into the iron curtain. Therefore, it advocates actively assisting European countries and initiating the conclusion of the Atlantic Pact to maintain regional security. But on the Soviet side, it is said that the United States is a war-monger, using the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan to create a new international war, and the conclusion of this Atlantic Pact is leading the world to war. The arguments of both sides seem to have their own reasons, and it is truly "this is right, and that is wrong." But if one stands on the sidelines, it is not difficult to say a fair word. As long as both sides have great politicians who are thinking about the people of the whole world, abandon subjective prejudices, and are not blinded by the gains and losses of the small self, then it is not impossible to transform hostility into harmony between the world's two major groups.</p>
<p>The people who talk about peace the most in the world are undoubtedly devout Buddhists. The most important thing in Buddhism is to persuade people that "resentment should be resolved, not perpetuated." If you want to resolve knots, you can only persuade and guide, not act as a judge. If the World Peace Congress does not start from this point, but insists on using the method of a "public judgment meeting" to first comment on who is right and who is wrong, I am afraid that it will be called defending world peace, but the result may deepen the crisis of war. Therefore, we feel that in the world peace movement, instead of relying solely on the Western way of thinking, arguing from the legal concept of right and wrong, it is better to add more of the Eastern way of thinking, from the standpoint of religious figures, and use compassion to persuade authoritative politicians, which will be more effective. The success or failure of peace talks in China also depends on this.</p>

<h3>Unilateral Modification of the Western Border of Germany Germans Unanimously Express Protest Consider This Act a Violation of the Atlantic Charter</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] The United States, Britain, and France jointly announced today that they would revise the western border of Germany. Thirty-one areas of German territory, covering 52 square miles, with a population of 13,500 residents, will be ceded to the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Saar Autonomous Region, and France, respectively, to improve transportation and management. This is the second change in the western border of Germany, the first being the autonomy of the Saar region. The border revision resolution is the result of months of meetings in Paris by the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Luxembourg.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 26th] According to well-informed sources, the formal agreement to revise the western border of Germany has been announced tonight, but the details will not be made public for two or three weeks to avoid smuggling activities and unexpected delays for residents. According to unofficial sources, the border to be revised in the Netherlands affects an area of a dozen kilometers long, located in the east of Nijmegen and in the Sittard enclave. These revisions only correct some unreasonable locations in the old border that are related to roads and wood roads.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] Radio Moscow broadcast today a German News Agency report stating that the decision of the United States, Britain, and France to cede 52 square miles of German land to the Netherlands, France, the Saar, Belgium, and Luxembourg is actually a seizure of German territory. The so-called administrative, transportation, and technical difficulties are just self-deception.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Düsseldorf, 26th] Political leaders in West Germany issued strong protests against the joint communiqué issued by the Allies stating that they would make some adjustments to the western border of Germany. A communiqué issued by the Rhineland government expressed extreme disappointment that the Western democratic groups did not grant the German people the right to self-determination, and stated that this act indicated that the countries had violated the provisions of the Atlantic Charter. The communiqué also stated that the Western Allies took this action by taking advantage of the fact that Germany could not exercise its powers internationally. This kind of cession of political and economic interests is a major blow to the spirit of forming a free Europe. Dr. Adenauer, Chairman of the German Parliament in Bonn, said that the Allied decision was a step backward on the road to European federation. A spokesman for the executive committee of the Social Democratic Party declared that this behavior by the West would give the Communist Party a good excuse to make equal or greater concessions in East Germany. Germany will never approve of this unilateral decision to change. Germany's democratic forces have been dealt a very heavy blow by Hitler's acts of aggression.</p>
<h3>Washington Deploys a Three-Foreign Ministers Conference to Discuss West Germany's Problems; US Disagreements on Occupation Regulations</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] The State Department is quietly deploying a conference of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France to discuss the West German problem. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Schuman will arrive in Washington next week to participate in the signing ceremony of the Atlantic Pact on April 4. The West German conference will likely be held immediately after the signing. The focus of the meeting will be on economic cooperation issues in the three occupation zones of West Germany.</p>
<p>Other issues include: (1) Drafting occupation regulations to govern the relationship between the occupying powers and the future German central government. The United States advocates granting the German government maximum freedom, while France wants to maintain the supreme authority of the Allied military government. (2) The division of powers between the German central government and local governments. Britain and the United States support centralism, while France advocates expanding the powers of local governments. (3) The Berlin blockade, seeking all possible ways to break the blockade. (4) Reparations issues. The Economic Cooperation Administration proposed reducing the number of German factories to be dismantled several months ago, but Britain and France did not accept it. (5) Banning and restricting German industries. The United States advocates easing bans and restrictions. These issues will not be fully resolved at the meeting, but only principles can be agreed upon, and representatives of the three foreign ministers will continue to meet to discuss the details.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] The State Department and the Department of Defense have prepared an $1.8 billion arms program for Western Europe and other free countries as a long-term military program to counter communist parties.

<h3>Theft Gangs Infest Residential Areas in Western Shanghai; Their Behavior and Dress are Just Like Gentlemen; Servants of Mansions Easily Fall into the Trap</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Recently, residents in the western district of this city have often been visited by theft gangs, and their methods of theft are very clever. A son of a celebrity and a colleague live together in an apartment on Route des Soeurs. Last weekend, when they were working in the central district, a man in a suit suddenly came to the apartment and said to the maid: Is so-and-so at home? The maid told him that he had left home to go to work. The man said: I am his friend, I just came to Shanghai from Hong Kong today. I know his office phone number, let me make a call to him. After saying that, he took the phone in the room and dialed, and the maid saw him talking warmly to the other party with the phone receiver. After that, the man finished the call and said to the maid: Your master will have someone from China National Aviation Corporation send two leather suitcases, which are mine. Please accept them for me. The maid, because of his airs and the fact that he had spoken to the master on the phone, believed it deeply. She thought: The master has not returned yet, I should fulfill my duty as a host, so she asked the man: Have you eaten anything? He replied that he had not eaten, so the maid said: I will fry some eggs for you. In this way, she went to the kitchen to fry eggs, leaving the guest alone in the living room. After the eggs were fried and sent to him, he sat for a while, and the man suddenly said: I have some things to do, I will go out for a while and come back. When he walked out the door, he repeatedly urged the maid to accept the suitcase when it was delivered, and the maid agreed. Unexpectedly, the man left and never returned, and no suitcase was delivered. When the son of the celebrity returned home in the evening, the maid told him about this, and he was very surprised, because there was no friend from Hong Kong who called him during the day, but he didn't take it to heart. There was no talk for one night, and when he got up to brush his teeth in the bathroom the next morning, he found that two tubes of toothpaste were missing in the kitchen. He also saw a camera and a case stuffed in the kitchen, so he rushed to check in the bedroom, and found that a Contax and a Rolleiflex camera were missing. The alarm clock on the table and the change in the drawer were also stolen. Also, a few days ago, in a residence in the western district, when the master was out, a car suddenly drove to the door. There was a man and a woman in the car. The man was in a suit and leather shoes, with a gentlemanly air, and the woman was in a gray mink coat, elegant and luxurious. At that time, the man got out of the car and asked: Is so-and-so at home? The maid replied that they were all out. The man expressed his disappointment, and seeing a child playing in the room, he said to the child: Do you still recognize me? Then he took the opportunity to sit down and play with the child with a smile. After sitting for a while, he suddenly frowned and said that his stomach hurt, and said that he had been suffering from dysentery these days and had to go to the toilet immediately. The maid immediately led him to the toilet upstairs to defecate. He came downstairs a few minutes later and continued to play with the child. After a while, his stomach suddenly hurt again. This time he went upstairs to the toilet by himself, and the maid did not accompany him. After coming downstairs, he sat for a while,</p>
<p>got in the car and left. When the master returned home that night, he found that dozens of US dollars, a ring, and some other odds and ends in the bedroom drawer had been stolen. It is said that many residents in the western district have encountered this kind of theft, and the theft gangs have inquired very clearly about the names of the residents who are the targets of the theft, as well as their living conditions, before using their theft tricks when they are not at home. In general, the maids of upper-class families must pay attention to and be wary of these well-dressed and brazen thieves.</p>

<h3>Public and Private School Teachers Face Desperate Living Conditions: Teachers' Monthly Salary as Low as Just Over 1,000 Yuan; Joint Petition Group Submits Six Demands</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The "Shanghai Public and Private School Principals and Teachers Groups Joint Petition Delegation" hosted reporters and people from all walks of life at the Daxia University Club in Xinhuaxincun, Nanjing West Road, yesterday morning to discuss the livelihood issues of teachers. This organization is composed of units such as the Shanghai Secondary Education Research Association, the Primary School Teachers Joint Continuing Education Association, the Municipal School Teachers Welfare Promotion Association, the Private School Principals Symposium, and the Teachers Fellowship. Because teachers and colleagues feel that their lives have reached a dead end and are on the verge of starvation, unable to live and unable to die, they believe that the government should not turn a blind eye. In order to save the current precarious education situation, in addition to urging the government to increase the percentage of education funding, they also request the government to implement the following requirements:</p>
<p>(1) Immediately issue private school teachers a subsidy of ten silver dollars per person; (2) Immediately issue private school teachers a loan of ten silver dollars per person; (3) Immediately restore the special allocation of one dou of rice per person per month; (4) The salaries of municipal school teachers must be issued in full according to their base salary without discounts, based on the monthly price index; (5) Maintain in-kind distribution, and restore the allocation of eight dou of rice. Arrears of cooking oil and coal briquettes should be issued immediately. If cash is converted, it should be calculated at the current retail market price; (6) Quickly issue three months' salary as emergency funds. The first three items are for the private school section, and the latter three items are for the municipal school section. After preparing a petition, it will be formally submitted to the government authorities in the coming days. They believe that these six points are the minimum requirements to solve the current difficulties of teachers in public and private schools in this city, and hope that colleagues in public and private schools throughout the city will unite and work hard to achieve them. The joint petition group is currently launching a widespread signature campaign, and it is said that more than 4,600 people had signed by the evening of the 26th. Tai Shuangqiu, Chen Bochui, and University Professor Xu Jie, all from the education sector who attended yesterday's reception, also spoke to express their support for their demands.</p>
<h3>Recent General Treatment of Public and Private School Teachers</h3>
<p>Regarding the current treatment of public and private teachers, a report was given at yesterday's reception: According to a survey of 3,056 teachers' salaries in private schools, the highest salary was 40,000 yuan for only one person, and the lowest was only 1,300 yuan for six people. The average salary was between 11,000 and 20,000 yuan, and teachers had to take care of their own meals. The average base salary of municipal primary school teachers is 140 yuan. 225 times this amount was issued in March, but after discounts, they only received 17,100 yuan, which is equivalent to about four dou of rice. Recently, the municipal government will issue another 675 times this amount, which will amount to 51,300 yuan, but the price of rice has already exceeded 75,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Neighborhood Head Flees with Family After Stolen Oil Found in Home</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Gasoline and engine oil have been frequently stolen from Hongqiao Airport recently, and the police authorities have been repeatedly notified, but the case has not been solved. The Xinjing Police Sub-bureau recently received a tip-off stating that a large amount of stolen oil was hidden at No. 6 Wujia Lane, south of the airport. On the 25th, Yang Jingwen, the head of the Criminal Division, ordered police officers to investigate. It was learned that the resident was the home of Wang Zhongming, the neighborhood head. Wang was formerly the captain of the Qingpu County Self-Defense Force and had considerable potential influence. At that time, Wang was out. After a police search, more than 300 gallons of gasoline and engine oil were indeed found hidden. A box cannon, serial number 50323, and 70 bullets were also found in the room. At that time, the oil was handed over to Neighborhood Head Lu for safekeeping, and the guns and ammunition were taken back to the sub-bureau. The next morning, the police officers in charge continued to go there, but unexpectedly, the whole family had fled. The oil was then transported back to the bureau, and an arrest warrant was issued for the fugitive Wang Zhongming for investigation.</p>
<h3>Two Dead and Nine Injured in Train Collision; Both Railway Lines Resume Operation Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Xihu train engine collided with the 22nd train engine at the North Railway Station at 8:40 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Railway Bureau immediately dispatched three cranes from Qishu Machinery Factory, Rihui Port, and Longtoufang to lift the overturned engines. By 8:52 a.m. yesterday, the P7116 engine had been lifted, and by 11:50 a.m., the C6162 engine had been lifted. The clearing work was completed at 1 p.m. Yesterday morning, various trains on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, such as the Xihu, Triumph, and Taihu, were unable to depart on time. After inspecting the various carriages, it was found that six carriages were damaged: TP858, TP832, TP894, TP817, TP 849, and SP804. The fatalities in the train collision included Yu Apei, the stoker of the 22nd train, and Yang Qiuxia (female), a refugee.

<h3>Policeman on Duty on Huashan Road Beaten and Seriously Injured with Broken Bones</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A Letian Teahouse at the intersection of Huashan Road and Hengshan Road in West Shanghai, which performs Shanghai opera, is quite popular. At around 1 p.m. yesterday, two policemen and one soldier had a verbal altercation due to a shoulder bump on the escalator. They then resorted to violence and dispersed. Before long, the soldier returned to his unit and led a large group of soldiers, all armed with rifles and Thompson submachine guns. They first surrounded the teahouse, and some went upstairs to search for the two policemen but could not find them. They then went to a nearby police booth and inquired about the whereabouts of policeman Zhang Tiegen, number 8010, who was on duty. Zhang replied that he had not seen them, which angered them and they thought he was intentionally protecting them. They immediately grabbed him and used iron bars and other weapons to break two of his ribs. They also seized his service pistol and armed belt and headed south along Xujiahui Road, remembering the bridge and towards Xietu Road. After receiving the report, the Xujiahui Police Sub-bureau dispatched a large number of armed police officers, led by Deputy Bureau Chiefs Chen Zhengming and Wang Lixian, to investigate the truth. At that time, most of the police officers were indignant, but Chief Chen tried his best to stop them, claiming that he would be responsible for negotiating with the commander of the troop and demanding the return of the seized firearms and other items. The police officers then returned to the bureau. Chief Chen then consulted with the 3rd Garrison Brigade to send personnel to negotiate with the troop. As of 8 p.m., the issue had not been resolved.</p>

<h3>China Aviation Struggles and Loses Three Cities; Railway Team Ascends to New Throne; Gentle Breeze and Sunny Day at Yiyuan Stadium Attract Ten Thousand Spectators</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The new champion of this year's football league was born yesterday. The Railway team overcame China Aviation by a score of three to zero amidst the sound of firecrackers, completing this year's masterpiece.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire match, China Aviation's offense was better than its defense, while the Railway team's defense was better than its offense, so the two sides were evenly matched. China Aviation's forward had a Gao Xiuqing, and the Railway team's defender had national player Gao Baozheng. The offense and defense of the two teams were well balanced. Although the Railway team won by a clean three goals, in reality, only the third goal can be considered truly solid. China Aviation's loss of the first two goals was due to a 20-yard penalty kick and an own goal. If the loss of the third goal was not so decisive, I would have truly felt sorry for China Aviation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, yesterday's final, although not particularly exciting or high-level, was tense and stimulating. In this cold and lonely Shanghai football scene, it was still a football match worth watching. Because the weather was sunny and the sun was shining, and the audience realized that the football season was coming to an end, Yiyuan was unprecedentedly lively, with a crowd of more than 10,000 people.</p>
<p>After the game, Mayor's Representative Zhang Peter held the award ceremony on the spot. Yesterday, 1,146 tickets were sold for 1,200 yuan each, and 4,046 tickets were sold for 800 yuan each, for a total revenue of 4,612,000 yuan. The referee was Zhang Le, and the linesmen were Ni Xiaoben and Lu Shunde.</p>
<p>Yesterday's game started at 3:00 p.m. China Aviation kicked off and attacked, but the attack was intercepted. The Railway team's army concentrated in China Aviation's territory, and the technique was trampled. Xie Xichuan inadvertently fouled, and Xiao Ziwen took a free kick, powerfully hitting the net and scoring the first goal. China Aviation was unwilling to give in and launched a full-scale attack. Xu Zuguo's low shot from 15 yards failed. Gao Xiuqing suddenly shot forcefully, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced down. Liao Xiong was about to catch it, but Yin Qingbing arrived like lightning and was judged to have fouled by hitting him in the face. Not long after being penalized, Yin Qingbing kicked the ball high into the middle. Xu Zuguo flashed in, but was just a hair's breadth away from success, again in vain. After a long and fierce battle, Yin Qingbing dribbled the ball forward, and Gao Baozheng collided with him head-on. Yin was injured and fell to the ground, leaving the field for treatment. The first half ended there. After a lemon break, they put on their jerseys again. Jin Jiabiao from China Aviation volunteered to help and replaced Shang Huajun. The Railway team became more and more courageous, and China Aviation initially showed signs of being unable to withstand the pressure. Xu Zuguo and Chen Yuwei exchanged positions, but it did not help the overall situation. The Railway team took the opportunity to attack, and the penalty area of China Aviation was full of dangers. The Railway team's central three forwards attacked in tandem. Xu Fusheng rushed out, Jin Chuanhan cleverly displayed his skills, and Wu Binghao had a moment of inspiration and touched the ball into the net, picking up an extra point. China Aviation gradually became exhausted, and although they fought like trapped beasts, they were already at a disadvantage. At 36 minutes, Wu Binghao had a chance to cross the ball, Lu Qingxiang headed it to the middle, and Zhang Jie slid to the ground and scooped it in, scoring another goal. After that, the battle gradually came to an end. When the silver whistle blew, the Railway team won the Mayor's Cup by a score of three goals.</p>

<h3>Qunli and Jingwu Draw with Three Goals Each</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., Qunli and Jingwu met at Yiyuan for a second round robin match. The referee was Zhu Qiu, and the linesmen were Zhang Zhiren and Li Guoyi. After the start of the game, Qunli's Yao Jihua made a clever pass to Ruan Longsheng, and forward Chen Longquan scored the first goal. Not long after, Lu Fangkui cut in and Chen Longquan scored again. Wu Jingren passed to the left wing and Fang Jiqiu shot into the left corner, pulling back a goal for Jingwu. Zhao Yongfang committed a handball outside the 30-yard line, and Wu Jingren took the free kick, which hit the target again, making the score 2-2. But in the blink of an eye, Lu Fangkui shot in the midst of the chaos and scored another goal, ending the first half with a score of 3-2. After a short break, the two sides fought again. Wu Jingren passed to the middle, and Wang Guoguang dribbled straight into the penalty area, making the score 3-3. Afterwards, although both sides had the intention of scoring, they lacked the skill to shoot. When the statutory time expired, the two sides drew with three goals each.</p>

<h3>Green Team Defeats Strong Rival Li Team Twice; Dominates the Women's League; Huili Continues Winning Streak, Defeats Peifeier</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Last night's basketball league program was quite appealing, with an audience of around 3,000 people. In the women's main game, the Green team defeated the Li team again by a score of 48-31, winning all seven games and showing the demeanor of a dominant team. In the Men's Division One game, Huili's victory over Peifeier was also a fierce battle, resulting in a score of 56-45, with a score of 30-18 in the first half. Huili has won three consecutive games and is on a winning streak. In Men's Division Two A, Donghua defeated Youyi, 64-42.</p>
<p>Huili established its dominance within five minutes with a score of 10-4, making the foreign soldiers run around in exhaustion. The double-teaming of Wang Yongfang and Tian Fuhai established the foundation in the first half, and Peifeier was unable to accelerate in the second half.</p>
<p>In the women's main game between the Green team and the Li team, the Li team's defenders guarded their respective zones in the first quarter, making it difficult for the Green team to attack, and both sides seemed to be somewhat abnormal. After the second quarter, the Green team developed more evenly. Although Qian Chuping of the Li team scored as many as 23 points, she could not avoid defeat again.</p>
<p>The game between Youyi and Donghua in Men's Division Two A had a relaxed atmosphere. Youyi remained calm despite being in a losing position. Donghua has won all four games.</p>
<p>Last night, a "business runner" patronized the gymnasium. A certain gentleman's fountain pen on the press seat was almost stolen, which was also a brief interlude in the game.</p>

<h3>Review of the Railway vs. China Aviation Game</h3>
<p>— Football Historian</p>
<p>The Mayor's Cup final was repeatedly postponed due to rain, and it was finally performed yesterday afternoon, attracting more than 10,000 spectators. China Aviation showed strong fighting spirit at the beginning of the game, and its defense was further strengthened by the return of Zhuang Wenquan. The forwards had commendable speed, but the weakness was in the midfield line. Regardless of assisting in offense or defense, they were inadequate. Jin Chuanhan performed above his usual standard and worked quite hard, and it can be said that he did his best, but he cannot shirk the blame for the second goal conceded. Chen Xiaoping had not fully recovered from his foot injury and worked diligently despite the pain, but this affected his speed. Shang Huajun was still competent. In the second half, Jin Jiabiao was substituted in. He had just returned from Dien Bien Phu, so he was unfamiliar with the game. In the first half, Xiao Gao and Yin Qingbing constantly fell back to defend and dribble the ball, so the disconnection in the midfield line was not very obvious. After Yin Qingbing was injured in the second half, his mobility was greatly reduced, and Xiao Gao also showed signs of exhaustion, so the front and back were weakened. Li Shunsheng and Chen Yuwei on the two wings still need to improve. In all fairness, China Aviation lost three goals that they should not have lost. The first goal was a free kick taken by Xiao Ziwen. Xu Fusheng was positioned too far to the right and did not defend Xiao Ziwen's quick shot to the left, conceding the first goal, which affected the morale of the soldiers. The second goal was caused by a misunderstanding between Jin Chuanhan and Xu Fusheng. Jin thought that Xu would rush out, but Xu did not. When Xu Fusheng rushed out, Jin Chuanhan happened to touch the ball with his abdomen, and Xu Fusheng failed to catch it, and Wu Binghao followed up and picked up an extra point. The third goal showed that the Railway team's forwards cooperated tacitly, but it was also due to China Aviation launching a full-scale attack, resulting in loopholes in the defense. In the second half, Chen Yuwei and Xu Zuguo exchanged positions, which did not help at all. On the contrary, there was no threat in the middle at all.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall strength of the two teams, the Railway team is certainly stronger, but miracles often happen in cup matches. Qingbai's tragic elimination is an example of this. However, the only way for China Aviation's forwards to win is to rely on speed. Gao Xiuqing is the leader among them. Yin Qingbing sometimes performs outstandingly and sometimes fades into obscurity. I still remember that during last year's National Games, Yin represented the Navy and played against Hong Kong. He scored a goal alone, but five minutes before the end of the game, Hong Kong equalized. In overtime, the Chinese team defeated the Navy. Yin was particularly determined in that game, but he could not maintain his normal state. If he practices diligently, he has a promising future. Goalkeeper Xu Fusheng performed very well. If it were not for his extraordinary efforts, China Aviation would have lost more than that.</p>
<p>The Railway team's Liao Xiong was particularly outstanding and saved many sure-fire goals. Gao Baozheng was stationed in the center, making it difficult for the Hu cavalry to cross Yinshan Mountain. The central defenders all had a steady performance. The central three forwards had tacit understanding in their movements and advanced quickly, often breaking into the enemy's formation with a fan-shaped offensive. Xiao Ziwen's penalty kick secured the victory, and Zhang Jie's darting and Lu Qingxiang's passing all showed superior skills. The only shortcomings were that the two wings were weaker. Wu Binghao only lacked speed, but his old skills were still there. Lin Dianxi only had the skill of going straight forward and passing the ball in front of the goal. In yesterday's game, Lin had a chance to score within only seven or eight yards in front of the goal, but he failed to score. He hesitated and could not make a decision, which was the biggest mistake. The whole team was full of energy, tireless in long battles, and cooperated well. Qingbai's unexpected defeat this time strengthened the confidence of the Railway team and allowed them to win the Mayor's Cup. If Qingbai's generals do not cheer up in the second round robin match, when the two heroes meet, the outcome is still unpredictable.</p>

<h3>Jia Tong Highway Overturn Accident: Driver's Oil-Saving Practice Caused the Disaster; Female Passenger Zheng Zhuling Died</h3>
<p>[Our Jiaxing, 25th Report] Following the tragic bus accident on the Jia Tong Highway on January 10th of this year, a similar incident occurred again on the 17th of this month. In the former case, passengers Xu Xuechu and another were crushed to death on the spot. In the latter, one female passenger, Zheng Zhuling, died. The two accidents were only 68 days apart, and the cause of both was careless driving by the bus drivers. The driver in the Xu case, Li Sibin, fled for fear of punishment and has not yet been apprehended. The driver in the Zheng case, Li Youhai, has been detained by the Tongxiang County Police Bureau and is currently being interrogated by the County Judicial Office. However, the Provincial Highway Bureau has not made any statement regarding these two tragic accidents. It is rumored that the Bureau has been actively lobbying various parties in recent days, attempting to exonerate the drivers responsible for the accidents. Residents of He and Tong counties are outraged upon hearing this, believing that the Provincial Highway Bureau is not considering disciplining bus drivers, thoroughly repairing road surfaces, or improving vehicles, but only seeking its own benefit. Such disregard for human life, in addition to the criminal responsibility of the drivers themselves for causing death through professional negligence, the Provincial Highway Bureau authorities should bear full responsibility for the Xu and Zheng tragedies. It is now reported that the Tongxiang County Party Secretary Chang Tonglun, Speaker Zhu Fen, and family members of the deceased passengers Xu Xueshuan and Zheng Guochang are initiating the organization of a Xu Zheng Tragedy Support Association and are personally planning to go to Hangzhou to petition the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Highway Bureau, the Ministry of Communications Office, the High Court, and other relevant agencies. At the same time, they are collecting detailed information about the overturn accident on the 17th, providing factual evidence, and appealing to all sectors of society to uphold justice. According to reports, the accident site was not on a bridge but on a flat roadside about four or five meters wide. Inspection of the overturned vehicle's components revealed that they were intact. The cause of the accident was clearly due to careless driving and excessive speed. It is rumored that the Provincial Highway Bureau adopts an "oil quota system" for its bus drivers, meaning that drivers are given a certain amount of gasoline per kilometer traveled, with any surplus going into the driver's pocket and any shortfall being covered by the driver themselves. Therefore, drivers drive as fast as possible and frequently turn off the engine and coast in neutral to save gasoline, which is the biggest cause of accidents.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Strange Young Man Leads to Unexpected Bust of Gambling Den</h3>
<p>[Our Wujin, 26th Report] A strange young man named Yu Chongguang, about twenty years old, has been staying at Room 140 of the Central Hotel in the city since arriving from elsewhere last month. He carries a pistol with him, leaves early and returns late every day, and his movements are mysterious, attracting the attention of the city defense department. On the 26th, early in the morning, officers were dispatched to the back of the Yingbin Hotel. After breaking down the door, they discovered a large group of gamblers gathered in a room gambling. Yu Chongguang was also among the crowd. One thousand gamblers were taken to the department along with gambling paraphernalia, gambling money, silver dollars, and banknotes for interrogation. After strict questioning, the young man Yu confessed that he was originally from Jiangxi, moved to Taiwan, and his family was quite wealthy. He came to Changzhou this time to take the entrance examination for the Provincial Changzhong School. Because the examination period had passed and he was not admitted, he stayed at the hotel. At the same time, a six-tael gold bar cast in Hong Kong was found in Yu's suitcase, and a pistol with eight bullets was seized from a friend. The case is still under investigation.</p>

<p>Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</p>
<h3>Young Man Regrets Engagement and Requests Explanation; Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi</h3>
<p>Editor: Last spring, a reader was engaged to a certain lady by his elder brother's decision (no marriage contract, no banquet, only a few items were given). At the time, I expressed disagreement and even opposed it. However, in order to avoid breaking fraternal affection, I reluctantly went through the engagement procedure with a certain lady (hereinafter referred to as the other party) under semi-coercion. After several months of investigation, I realized that the other party was not only illiterate but also an unteachable woman, making it impossible to unite. The other party's parents have repeatedly urged the wedding to be held, but I have been evasive and delaying, saying that my current economic capacity is insufficient and preparations are not yet complete. Considering my future happiness, I must not make a mistake again and again. Now is the time to terminate the contract, but as someone unfamiliar with the law, I feel at a loss in everything. Therefore, I have told you the whole story and ask you to enlighten me.</p>
<p>[Answer] Marriage should not rely too much on ideals, and family is very practical. Shanghai is prosperous, and young people's dreams often focus on freedom and appearance, leading to infatuation with lovers, resulting in marital suffering. It must be known that husband and wife are based on common feelings and common sense, not the celestial beings in novels. Moreover, in this day and age, where economics determines everything, one should especially consider the situation when forming a family in the future. Therefore, please carefully consider whether you are a good match, and do not rashly consider the other party unsuitable and want to terminate the engagement simply because of your elder brother's orders, the other party's level of knowledge, or the other party's appearance and clothing! As for the points you asked, I will answer them separately as follows: (1) The law stipulates that a male or female engagement must have the consent of the parties involved. If there is no consent, it is naturally invalid. However, at the time of the engagement, did you know that you were already of age? If you were already of age but did not voice your disagreement at that time, and now that the engagement has been made, you are requesting termination of the contract, you should be responsible for compensating the other party for any damage to their reputation and actual losses. Therefore, the termination of the contract should be with the consent of the other party; it cannot be effective based on a unilateral claim, such as a notice or announcement. (2) Lawyers only handle legal procedures on behalf of their clients and should not be mistaken to think that hiring a lawyer can turn an invalid agreement into a valid one. (3) The return of engagement gifts depends entirely on who is at fault for the termination of the contract. (4) If the other party understands reason and logic, they should seek a solution and not delay it unreasonably, which would harm their own life. However, in order to obtain favorable terms, it is not impossible to ignore unreasonable requests and urge the fulfillment of the engagement. (5) Without terminating the current engagement, you cannot make another engagement with a third party, which would cause disputes. (6) A lawyer's obligation is limited to wrongful imprisonment; if you want to protect your rights or remove obstacles, you should pay appropriate fees. This newspaper's social service column is limited to answering legal questions, and we do not introduce lawyers for hire.</p>
<h3>Mail-Order Fountain Pen Is Not Delivered After a Long Delay...Reader Asks for Attention to Reputation...</h3>
<p>(1) We hope the Ximeilishi Company will pay attention.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I previously wrote to your column to inquire about the delayed approval of the fountain pen by the Meilishi Company. I am grateful for your reply that you have forwarded the letter for inquiry and will inform me after receiving a reply. However, time flies like a stream of water, and it has been almost a month! I have been looking forward to it, but I have not yet seen the company send the fountain pen. I hope you will publish it quickly to urge them to pay attention to their reputation and not think that customers from other places can be deceived. It will be a blessing for readers everywhere. Sincerely, reader Li Jixiu, to the Shenbao Service Column.</p>
<p>(2) We hope the Xiliangyou Fountain Pen Company will pay attention.</p>
<p>To the Shenbao Social Services Column: I sent a postal order on February 3rd to purchase a pen from the Liangyou Fountain Pen Company on the second floor of the New World Hotel at No. 1 Nanjing West Road, Shanghai. The postal receipt has already been stamped and returned, but after waiting for more than a month, the pen has not been sent. I have sent three letters urging them, but they have ignored them. I do not know what the company's intention is and where its credibility lies. Please urge the company to give a public reply! From reader Chen Yuyi.</p>
