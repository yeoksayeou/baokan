<h3>江北共軍進攻不已　猛犯安慶仍經國軍擊退　荻港西北江中之太陽洲守軍撤離</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕中共中央雖已正式下令停止軍事進攻，然江北前綫截至十二日午前仍有若干橋頭堡迄在共軍砲火繼續攻擊中，其中尤以安慶裕溪口（蕪湖對江）及获港鎭西北江中之太陽洲戰事最烈。安慶方面，十一日夜起，共軍陳賡部一個師，仍不斷向城東北農業學校，棋盤山一帶猛犯，至十二日拂曉前，被擊退後，於晨九時復不斷向國軍陣地展開砲擊，經國軍陸海空協同還擊後，迄午戰事始趨平息。裕溪口方面昨晚起，共軍陳毅部卅軍兩個師，亦猛烈來犯，迄十二日午，亦被擊退。太陽洲方面陳毅部第廿四軍約一個師，在砲火掩護下，於十一日午夜由北岸劉家渡强渡至江中太陽洲，保衛該洲之國軍一個營，以衆寡懸殊，經力戰後，至十二日午乃主動撤離，藉以加强南岸防務。其餘江浦城及西梁山（當塗對岸）亦分於昨晚今午前被共軍攻擊，俱經國軍擊退。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕據某軍事觀察家談：十二日　北前綫若于橋頭堡所以仍被共軍攻擊者，實由於共軍企圖於接獲停止進攻命令前，盡可能攻取江北各較為重要之國軍橋頭堡陣地，俾便於一旦和談破裂即行大舉過江，故昨今兩日除划子口（棲霞山對岸）以東迄江陰對岸之八圩各橋頭堡共軍略向後撤，戰事因趨平静外，至江浦以西至安慶之綫戰事迄仍繼續中，故外傳所謂江北共軍普遍後撤，顯屬過早，而共軍之是否誠意停止軍事進攻，至十三日晚應可見分曉。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕浦口西江浦城北約四五華里各山地國軍陣地，十一夜續被共軍吳化文部千餘來犯，迄十二晨四時許已由國軍劉秉坊部擊退。又，棲霞山對江划子口國軍十一夜擊退來犯之共軍五百餘，斃共軍五十餘，俘三。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江十二日電〕鎭江當面情况今無變化。據軍方某人士透露：揚六綫共軍主力確已後撤，主力部隊已往揚州，但六圩方面國軍並未向前推進，今晨仍固守老四圩，朱家旗桿，晨家橋一帶，瓜洲十二圩等綫亦平静。又據悉：江北沿江國軍之橋頭堡，除瓜洲，六圩，十二圩，浦鎭，裕溪口，和縣等地外，餘均陷入共軍手中。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十二日電〕林彪部四十三軍十一日由河口以南進入黄安縣城，一部　餘踞長軒嶺。</p>
<p>〔本報黄陂十二日電〕據十二日由信陽来此之交通界人土談：南下之林彪部隊四十·四十三兩軍中，雜有日俘及韓共確係事實，渠等所著之軍服與共軍同，為數約佔百分之十强。</p>

<h3>安慶人心安謐　本報記者入城訪問</h3>
<p>〔本報安慶十二日電〕本報記者經三日行程，由九江抵達安慶，於十二日下午六時進入苦戰廿一日之名城安慶，當晚由鲍士琦上校引見守將吳中堅師長。安慶城內秩序井然，人心安謐。自安慶守備戰展開後，外埠報記者進城訪問者以本報為第一人。</p>
<h3>國軍早已不進攻　無須頒發停戰令</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕此間晚報載政府方面已於十一日下午三時由國防部參謀正式簽署頒發停戰令，經記者向關係方面調查，俱謂「並無所聞」各級軍事指揮單位亦迄尚未接獲此命令。又據京滬杭警備總部高級負責人告記者，目前總統發表元旦文告正式倡導和平後，國軍迄未尚共軍展開攻擊，故此項停戰令在國軍方面實際上已務必要。</p>
<h3>立法院舉行秘密會議　劉攻芸報告財政　收支不平衡發鈔政策實非得已　各委主增稅收反對抛售</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕立法院十二日晨舉行院會，財長劉攻芸應邀列席，答覆質詢，會中以一〇七票對一〇六票之多數通過改開秘密會議，由劉攻芸答覆立委劉士篤等四十二人所提之質詢，據稱：（一）大鈔發行爲應付需要，目前根本問題為收支不能平衡，政府正設法增加稅收，修正財政金融改革案中巳提出稅元，關元等辦法，盼立院早日通過施行。（二）金，銀，外匯遷台灣，華南等地，係為安全着想，並係奉令遷移者，隨時可以運回。抛售黄金目的，為收縮通貨，抑制物價，且保按市價拋售，買者無利可圖。（三）發行政策為不得巳之舉，事實上財政能維持至今日，有來於通貨發行，政府仍將盡力設法改善宫兵公教待遇，并收縮通貨，平抑物價。（四）政府一向維持文化事業，故對京報業貸款每家六千萬元，本人對此無成見。午後繼續開會時，各委員紛提質詢，咸反對以拋售金銀收縮通貨，主張以墳加稅收代替發行政策，並拿出勇氣改革幣制，其未及發言者，致以書面提出，由劉攻芸書面答覆，秘密會議乃告結束。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕立法院十二日院會中，為立委許聞天·金紹先被捕事，曾引起軒然大波，各委員對於軍事機關非法逮捕立委，咸表憤慨。何院長之措施，顯已獲得立委之贊同；惟多數立委仍要求確定主要負責人為京滬杭警備總司令湯恩伯，應咨請政院予以處分。爭辦良久，始獲通過。該案係晨間由童院長以臨時報告方式提出，即席說明委員許聞天·金紹先二人前日被京滬杭警備總部逮捕及本院向政院何院長交涉釋放經過，並謂金委員已於當日晚十一時釋放，許委員亦於十二日晨由滬抵京，經陳秘長親赴政院接回，返寓休息，定下午出席院會報告。關於此事，何院長曾來函說明處理情形。原函當即宣讀（見另條），旋金紹先應各委員之請，報告被捕經過（內容與十二日本報所載者相同）。金氏表示：此次事件之處理，表示政院尚有力量，甚為欣慰。張九如繼之發言，謂政院處理雖佳，但以後不僅應注意中央，對地方上之捕人事件，亦應注意。邵鏡人稱：此次逮捕立委，係違憲之舉，渠主張嚴重質詢，迫究責任，嚴予懲辦，以維護憲法。主席宣稱：本案可否候至下午許委員報告後，再行討論，眾無異議。午後秘密會議結束後，改開院會，即請許聞天報告被捕經過（見另條），旋各委員相繼發言，抨擊此舉之違法。蕭覺天稱：立院不但不能保護人民基本自由，即本身之基本自由亦無法保護，言之痛心。牛踐初謂，共黨造成赤色恐怖，政府絕不能造成白色恐怖，渠主張於本身安全之外，亦應注意保障人權。鄒樹文謂，各處逮捕機關太多，希望能簡化一點。武和軒謂，此事爲一嚴重的憲法問題，應該問政府要不要憲法。關於本案之處理，各委員一致主張咨請政院，（一）查明責任，究竟是誰發的命令；（二）主辦人員如此荒謬，應於一星期內查明嚴辦；（三）通令軍警機關，除現行犯外，不得擅行逮捕立法委員；（四）今後對人權，應切實保障，惟對是否須指明主要責任者，則發生異見。武和軒於聲明與湯恩伯係朋友後，謂湯恩伯應負全責，予以辦懲。黄宇人亦謂：何院長手函中，已證明湯應負責。楊公達主張應於查明以後，再要求辦懲湯恩伯。台下頓起一片嘘聲，會塲因之紊亂。邵鏡人謂：責任應由湯負，但立院非審判機關，不能指定由誰負責，可咨請政院查此最高負責人，予以嚴辦。黄宇人仍表反對，紛爭甚久，最後由陳顧達提出修正意見，為：「根據何院長来函，湯恩伯既已自請處分，為維護憲法尊嚴計，應由行政院依法處分」。始告通過。此外，各委員意見，包括切實保障人權，一星期內嚴懲主辦人員，所有一切特務組織，應由政院查明，澈底解散及請政院轉令主辦機關報告，提出許委員煽動叛變證據，由許委員答辯，查明眞相後，由大會決定等，均一併咨謂政院辦理。</p>
<p>許聞天昨晨返抵京　在滬並無虐待刑訊情形　謂對此次誤會不願擴大</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕在京被捕之立委許聞天，十一日晚在滬開釋後，即搭夜車於十二日晨抵京。主辦該案之高參陳祖明同來，下車後同赴行政院，因許之開釋京滬杭警被總部奉行政院長何應欽令辦理者，當將許氏交政院秘書長黃少谷，許因以被辦及開釋經過面告黃氏，旋返寓邸休息，午後出席立院報告被捕經過。記者曾往訪問，據談：本人對此次誤會，不願擴大，自被捕至開釋，亦無虐待及刑訊情事。據渠所知，十日被捕後，同時由衛戌總部解往京滬杭警備總部之二人一為方姓，現仍在滬扣押，一為賈姓，被捕後曾吞金，經發覺後已送醫院救治，該二人均為農工通訊社職員。記者詢以湯恩伯總司令報告何院長，謂「近獲有證據，許委員涉有煽動軍隊叛變之重大嫌疑」，究竟是否有關？許氏答稱：此事早成過去，且與渠無關，渠曾任江蘇省訓練團教育長，故所織之友人極多，所指叛變，或係鎭江之江蘇省保安第二旅旅長及陶鴻釗及蘇州水警局長張少華，惟陶張均已被捕矣。許氐承認，設渠非立法委員，恐不能如此順利開釋。按許氏之釋出，係由於逮捕不合法，經立院向政院抗議之結果，然許案並未了結，許氏與記者談話時，對此點亦未予否認</p>
<p>在立法院申報告　被捕及開释經過</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕立委許聞天十二日下午在立院申報告渠被捕及開釋經過稱：十日下午二時許在文風書店被捕後，即被押往衛戊總部警衛組，至四時後復被送往孝陵衛京滬杭警備總司令部，十時乘汽車解往鎭江車站，改乘火車十一日晨抵滬，先送滬市警局，旋由警局送至另外一地方，迄晚又被送上車站，乘軍返京。許稱：此次被捕，係屬誤會，因彼等有一組織，名爲「孫文主義革命同盟」，於去春成立，主要的為求三民主義之再發展，盟員均為國民黨員，年來發展甚速，頗引起注意，各方對此項組織亦未盡了解。最近各地盟員被捕者甚多，本人亦為盟員，故可能由此引起誤會。許氏旋聲明在滬受審訊時，曾合渠寫供，供詞均已預有題目，其中多為本人不解者，只能詢問彼等意見，照寫此項供狀，渠不能承認。許氏並稱：自前日迄今晨，渠所見到被捕之民衆及軍人甚多，渠以為普通人民犯法，有司法機關審理，不愿由軍事機關拘押，關於此點渠希望立院有所糾正。至渠個人，則希望立院勿因此事引起波瀾，目前環境艱難，和談正進行中，渠不願因個人間題引起波瀾，而影響和談。</p>

<h3>注意武漢的防務！</h3>
<p>和談雖有了一綫轉機，江北前綫的軍事，暫呈膠着狀態；惟武漢外圍形勢，仍是外鬆內緊，未來的發展，是值得注意的。綜合今日武漢情况，自白祟禧將軍統率的部隊，由河南駐馬店一直撤退到武漢外圍的孝感以後，共軍從平漢路南段兩翼包抄，似乎逐漸迫進鄂東，鄂中，鄂西等地的渡江橋頭堡，漢口變成了突出江北的一個據點。現在鄂東鄂西感受共軍的壓力日益沉重。鄂東的黄梅浠水國家轉進以後，武漢外圍國家刻正加强孝感黄陂一帶的防務，十日平漢路北上車僅通横店，軍事危機近在咫尺。國軍在這方面的轉移自然并非敗退，完全是爲了戰略上的關係，藉以加强武漢外圍的防守。看國軍的態勢勢和決心，武漢是能防守的，儘管周圍形勢日緊，白崇禧將軍成竹在胸，必能不惜任何代價，保衛大武漢的。</p>
<p>武漢爲長江的腹部，中流所寄，形勢重要；姑以武漢位置而言，如以千哩為半徑，劃一圓圈；舉凡平，津，京，滬，廣州，貴陽，成都，蘭州，西安，太原，都在範圍以內，足徵武漢在我國地理上處於核心的地位。武漢，即漢口漢陽武昌三鎭之總稱，論其形勝，襟带江（長江）漢（漢水），綰轂南北，昔人稱九省之通衢，南北交通之要津，向西北，有漢水可通陕甘，往東往西，有大江可達滇，蜀，蘇，皖；再加以有平漢路北達北平，冀豫二省，粤漢路南通廣州，更可聯絡粤東，實爲我全國交通之中心。詩經所謂「滔滔江漢」，「如江如漢」，「江漢浮浮」，「江漢湯湯」，非歌詠江漢之水，實在是讚美武漢形勢，有湯湯滔滔之勢，其一動一浮，均足可綰殺南北。　　由於武漢形勢的重要，我國歷史上任何一次兵爭，南北用兵者，未有不以此得失為成敗的關鍵。昔人有云：「春秋之楚，兵家常爭」。一部春秋戰國史，可以說是楚地的紛爭史，足見南北用兵爭楚的形勝，關係一次歷史的轉捩甚大。民國創立，先是辛亥義旗一舉，全国為之響應，未及牛載，而河山光復，造成共和。雖亡清亦有亡清之由，然據地得勢，始能收效有如此之速，決不偶然。這不僅說明武漢形勢之重要，而且說明武漢防守的重要。</p>
<p>欲守武漢，必先鞏固其外圍；否則不易久安。抗日戰爭的武漢大會戰，未在核心作戰，而係在外圍決戰。所謂武漢外圍，範圍極闊，東有武穴薪　，以至九江湖口，更遠及彭澤馬當；北沿平漢有桐柏山脈雞公山之險，義陽三關之要，西北溯漢水有襄樊之固，尤爲古來南北之鎖鑰。其西荊州之地，江陵所在，控巴夔要路，接武漢之上游，北抱襄樊，南通常沅，襟帶江湖，拱臂吳楚，諸葛武侯所謂用武之國，顧祖禹所謂湖廣之重鎭也。武漢不但為兩湖之咽喉。抑且爲長江之咽喉。今日共軍進窺武漢，意欲薄此一咽喉之地，以利於控制華中，威脅京滬，動搖華南，從而切斷川康對外的聯絡。所以武漢之得失，關係太大了，值得朝野密切注意的。</p>
<p>看目下國共兩軍的態勢，國軍是必須防守武漢。共軍是必須爭取武漢，因而武漢外圍的爭奪，是很難避免一塲惡戰。武漢未來的演變，我們不便作過早的臆測，不過我們可以指出，武漢的得失，關係和談的進行很大，並臣關係國共兩軍優劣形勢很大。所以今天之武漢及其防務，是值得我們深切地予以重視和關懷的。</p>

<h3>立委许聞天被捕內情　一再煽動軍隊叛變均有確鑿證據　承辦人員不明法律手續亦經扣押</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於立法委員許聞天之被捕一事，記者爲明瞭此案眞相，昨走訪治安機關探詢，獲悉內情如次：許氏隸屬於所謂「孫文主義革命同盟」（請參閱今日第五版），曾任該同盟之軍事部長，現任「民族自衛軍蘇難總指揮」，兼代理該同盟之組織部長，聞實際上，此一組織為共黨外團，許氏遠在三十四年夏即在重慶開始活動，曾先後參加國民黨革命新派，中國農工社會黨，三民主義革命聯盟，以迄最近參加孫文主義革命同盟，此一組織專門深入京滬地區各軍事機關，對國軍，地方部隊，暨高級將領策東叛變，以迎接共軍渡江，乃爲一有計劃有目的之煽動組織。綜計數月來因許之策動而引起之叛變事件多起：本年二月間江蘇保安第二旅旅長兼鎭江城防指揮官陶鴻釗，首先被許煽動，企圖於二月底迎接共軍渡江，幸當局發覺尚早，以迅雷不及掩耳之手段，於二月廿四日將陶逮捕。此爲許之第一次策動工作，因許係立委，治安機關人員僅派員跟蹤監視，未予逮捕·三月下旬，駐京郊湯山之九十七師師長王彥昌率部出走投共此為許之第二次策動工作。同時許派張達生（共軍第四軍長淮陰華中區工作委员會委員），陳惕　（前浙江省政府委員，現任該同盟上海支部負責人），嚴一民（身份不詳）三人來滬向駐軍活動，於三月廿八日在山西路南京飯店秘密開會時，遭治安機關派員拘捕。最近駐嘉興預幹團一部份官兵發生叛變，為許之第三次策動工作。以上所舉係犖犖大者，其他經許氏活動少對象有十餘單位，均經治安機關搜集確騐情報與證據，認爲值此共軍企圖渡江聲中，對江南治安亟須確保，許之行動。影響民心士氣，遂不得已而下令於本月十日將許逮捕。另一立委金紹先，因與許同事，誤遭逮捕，嗣經查明，即行釋放。許氏被捕後，在治安徽關對策動叛變事件承認不諱，幷繕就自述書，對策動經過歷歷如繪，幷稱叛變軍隊貴共軍陳毅指揮。治安機關因立委非現行犯，依憲法不得逮捕，已於前日夜車將許護送赴京，補辦合法手續，再行正式偵訊。此案被捕者共七人，除許聞天，陶鴻釗，陳惕　，張達生，嚴一民外，尚有方志農（孫文主義革命同盟秘書），盧碧湖（現任江寗縣長，曾任滬市龍華北站警察分局長），亦因同案被捕。此外，尚有該同盟之宣傳部兼聯絡部，工運社會部，財務部，言論研究委员會等負責人，均係知名之士，治安機關正趕辦手續後將予以一網打盡。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕關於立委許聞天被捕事，記者走訪湯恩伯總司令，據湯氏稱：本案承辦人員不明法律手續，魯莽從事，甚表遗憾，現已合將本案承辦人員扣押，嚴于懲辦，並将許氏於十一日晚護送返京</p>

<h3>杜魯門致國會特別咨文　促批准大西洋公約　強調該約為走向和平大道重要步驟　參院辯論至少需時一月</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十二日廣播：杜魯門總統頃以北大西洋公約送交特別參院，請求批准。總統遞交參院之咨文稱此公約為實踐美國人民決意建立一公正而永久和平之重大步驟。總統並間接否認蘇聯稱此約與聯合國憲章抵觸之指責。總統稱，本公約之十二簽字國家，係根據聯合國憲章第五十一條之規定，運用其「集體的或單獨的對侵略者自衛」之權。總統本擬僅以公函致參院，後因亟欲此約能早獲核准，故於週末決定另送咨文。總統稱，「本公約僅為走向和平大道之一步，蓋欲求和平，初非僅採一種行動即可濟事。吾人必須繼續以謹慎與忍耐之態度，斟酌環境，採取實際與現實之步驟，以謀建立健全與鞏固之和平。本公約即係針對目前實際情形，根據聯合國憲章及美國憲法而草成者。本公約實代表美國人民之願望，即和平與安全，並繼續能有自由生活及工作之機會。」總統對實行該公約時美國應負之經濟責任，未加涉及。總統並稱，「北大西洋集團之人民，今已獲致神聖之協議，保證各小國之安全，使其和平及權利不再受到恐怖及壓迫之威脅。各國休戚相共，蓋欲得到經濟上之繁榮或軍事上之安全，實不能僅憑一國之單獨努力。」</p>
<p>總統並稱，北大西洋公約國家之「聯合力量」，將來對全世界之自由人民有極重要之關係。各國既均致力於報帳人權及正義，則語言雖異，政治經濟之制度雖有不同，皆不足成為國際團結之阻礙。本公約之成立可為明證。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十一日電〕在北大西洋公約之規定成為對美國具有約束性之前，必先經過參院三分之二多數加以批准，眾認此項公約之將獲批准乃屬必然者。參院外委會主席康納利本日透露，有關安全聯盟之聽取意見，將於下星期一開始，且將繼續舉行「充分公開」討論約達一個月。</p>

<h3>日對德看齊</h3>

<p>〔聯合社東京十二日電〕盟國某外交家今稱，取消對德軍事管制，可能為放鬆對日管制之先例。管制可以放鬆各方意見幾乎一致，且亦勢所必然，但日本是否能自動脫離戰後之經濟困境不無疑問。西德政府一旦成立，世界視綫或將轉移至日本，視其能否自立。屆時或將產生某種壓力，嘗試在日本出以同樣作為，日本人自身之壓力亦在其內。</p>

<h3>美國爲什麽失勢於亞洲</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯　室特譯稿</p>
<p>中共利用中國農民的傳統的資產，和民眾對國民政府怨恨，已經獲得成功。中國農民是最易駕馭的，中共允許給予他們土地是一種有力的吸引。這些農民支持中共，是希望局面的轉變使他們的命運好轉。某中國共產黨員對那訪員說：「我們最有力的宣傳是土地」。</p>
<p>這個宣傳效力甚著，某一地區一旦被共軍佔領後，那裏的農民絕少有爭取國軍的。中共領袖設法使農民從內戰裏面得到一種利益，因此他們中間絕無人準備以生命來爭取國軍的歸來。</p>
<p>支持國民黨作為最強大的反共勢力的美國官員，沒有方法把國民政府澈底改革一下，來肅清那些連蔣介石都曾譴責過的貪污行為。據駐在中國的某美國官員稱：美國所投下用以打擊中共的每一美元，收回僅僅不到一角。</p>
<p>遊歷中國的外國人得到了國民黨反共能力低劣的證明。曾經多年努力提高國民政府的效能的美國人，除了少數的例外以外，似乎覺得他們的努力處處遇到失敗。</p>
<p>現在，針對着中共的勝利，有人建議美國以陸軍在中國登陸，以保持中國賸餘的部份。但是各方面的感應非常敏銳，美國務院中一部份官員認為這種行動可能把美國人捲入無窮期的戰爭漩渦中，而有遭受非共黨份子一致反對美國的危險。</p>
<p>東南亞洲一致反</p>
<p>傳統的殖民地主義的色彩，已經在這區域裏死去了。印尼和越南人民幾乎瘋狂地要求擺脫荷蘭和法國的統治。爲了大戰期間美國曾拼命宣傳四種基本自由和人民自治權的重要，叛軍的領袖滿冀美國將幫助他們為自由而奮鬥。現在他們的迷夢已醒而感到怨憤，他們責怪美國袖手旁觀。</p>
<p>最近有一新聞記者遊歷印尼，目睹民眾對荷人深惡痛絕，同時反美情緒高漲。多數印尼人認為美國一方面對印尼共和國口惠而實不至，一方面間接援助荷蘭保守東印度羣島。由於歐洲復興計劃包括法國和荷蘭在內，遠東各國人士感覺美國非但不援助殖民地，反而偏袒殖民地的佔領國。</p>
<p>美國雖曾在聯合國中猛烈指責荷蘭在印尼的軍事行動（荷方稱之為「警備行動」），但是叛軍領袖們要求美國在強硬的言論以後，繼之以強硬的行動。共產黨已屢次昭告印尼人，說他們已被美國所出賣。共產黨的這一政策已經站定了脚頭。</p>
<p>在印尼共和國首都日惹的書攤上，差不多完全是馬克思主義的宣傳小冊子。有一位二十三歲的印尼新聞記者很坦白的告訴美國記者說：他願意担任地下工作，追隨任何領袖——即使是共產黨——參加反抗荷人的遊擊戰。</p>
<p>在越南方面曾有某法籍官員估計土民中百分之九十五都是國民軍，抱有反抗法國統治的決心。有一枝地下軍隊已把法國人圈入六個城市中，甚至在這些地域裏面也不是安全的去處。</p>
<p>若干年以前，越南的遊擊隊曾經盼望美國幫助他們爭取獨立。相反地，美國租借法案的軍火出現在法人方面。因此他們轉向共產黨方面，讓他們來領導自由的鬥爭。</p>
<p>有一位青年醫學學士，剛從遊擊戰的前綫歸來，對美國記者談及美國通過馬歇爾計劃援助法國的這件事，言下不勝憤慨。他以下面幾句話說明他爲什麽擁護越共領袖胡志明：「我們不是以共產黨而是以國民黨的資格追隨胡志明。我們捨此別無他途。即使是反對共產主義的人，與其讓法人來統治，倒不如讓本國的共產黨來統治好些。」</p>
<p>昔日好感喪失殆盡</p>
<p>自從對日戰爭結束以來，亞洲各地已屢次顯示對於美國的失望。鼓舞起緬甸人爭取獨立的情緒的美國的四種基本自由的諾言，用傳單散布的。馬來的人民確信能夠解放他們的是美國人，而不是英國人。他們在市鎮裏面貼着標語說：「驅逐日本人，迎接美國人。」</p>
<p>一位美國記者遊歷遠東十個國家，歷時八個月，所得到的印象可以歸納如左：</p>
<p>越南和印尼的混亂局勢繼續存在，大部份歸咎於美國（是否公允那是另一問題）。</p>
<p>美國支持和資助蔣介石政府的政策，耗去了幾億美元，對於遏制中共的進展，未嘗發生絲毫顯著的效果。美國的威信漸漸喪失了。</p>
<p>自從美國推行扶住日本復興的政策以後，漸漸離間了與日本復興休戚相關的亞洲國家。遠東方面人士猜想美國佔領日本的結果，也許會造就一個並非富強而民主的，或是西方的可靠盟國的日本。</p>
<p>總之，一位在東方已有多年經歷的新聞記者，在遍訪亞洲各地以後，得到一種信念：即美國遠東政策，在最近三年中，已經把美國在此複雜地域內前所享有的好感犧牲凈了。（譯自「美國新聞與世界報告」）</p>

<h3>當局決拋大量銀元　向美方購白銀　準備運華鼓鑄</h3>
<p>自銀元開放自由買賣以來，市價日漲夜大，昨日已較八一九限價時期，高出四萬倍以上，打破各項物價上漲紀錄，刺激一般物價上漲，影響民生至深且巨，有關各當局對茲極為注意。據華東社記者昨由有關方面獲悉，當局為抑制物價上漲之因素起見，決將開始在滬大量拋售銀元，除限價時期收兌之大量銀元與中央造幣廠新船洋外，并已新向澳洲訂購巨額銀元，首批一百餘萬枚即將運滬，均將在滬拋售，俟拋售技術商妥後，即將開始。按目前美國白銀市價，每盎斯美金七角，銀元每枚七錢二分，合美金祗五角，現滬市銀元每枚已超過美金一元，故當局已向美進行訂購巨額白銀，準備運華錢拋云。</p>

<h3>麺粉易煤比率　南北商洽變更</h3>
<p>據船聯會運煤船舶調配組負責人稱：第一批秦皇島開灤煤十萬噸，業已全部運完。第二批由於麺粉與開灤煤之交換比率問題，尚在商洽中。因開灤煤礦當局以上海煤價甚高，故要求以麺粉四袋半易取開灤煤一噸。經兩方商洽後，可望以麺粉四袋易煤一噸。並聞日內即可訂約。現空船十艘正候裝載麺粉北上。至於北上船隻並非任何輪船均可參加，事先必須獲得行政院批准外，復須電徴北平中共當局之同意，否則均難北駛，故目下參加北駛之船隻，僅有十五艘已獲批准。另據航業界消息：目前各輪船公司自長江航運受阻後，業務更形清淡，一千噸至三千噸左右之輪船，有六十餘艘將告停航，故輪船業之危機日益嚴重。</p>

<h3>中蠶協會理監會議議決　請即舉辦蠶絲貸款　推定代表三人赴京請願</h3>
<p>蠶絲為吾國特產，並佔出口貿易之首位，蘇浙農村賴以繁榮。復員以來，因農村殘破，農民無力購種育蠶，廠商亦以資力薄弱無力收購鮮繭，爰由政府舉辦桑苗製種養蠶收繭各項低利貸款，由政府收購生絲，以獎進生產。施行以來，生絲質量年有增進，在政府既得掌握大量出口物資，每年出口絲量達一萬餘關担，增益外匯收入，農村經濟亦藉此蘇復，俾得購儲肥料食米，裨益於社會秩序之安定者至鉅。去秋因幣制改革，各種貸款一律停止，蠶絲貸款未能獨異，但其結果，繭市紊亂，蠶農求售無門，被迫蒸晒，致喪失寶貴原料，殊深痛惜。現在春繭期迫，中國蠶絲協會鑒於蠶絲貸款之關係重要，爰於本月十日在武進路二一六號召集第二屆理監事聯席會議，由理事長冷禦秋氏主席，計到理監事五十九人。首由冷禦秋氏致詞，後由何常務理事尚平報告去秋赴法出席世界生絲會議經過，頗為詳盡。當經一致決議，分電院部及中央銀行，請將各項蠶絲貸款迅速舉辦，以安農商，並經推定代表三人，赴京進謁各主管當局請願，以免貨棄於地，坐失農時。</p>
<p>又悉，該會理監事聯席會決議要案，尚有組設蠶絲學術研究委員會，負責辦理研究出版調查等工作，以謀改進。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕漁管處漁康輪過期失修，遭暴風雨襲擊沉沒，死傷多人一案，經地檢處數度偵查，頃告終結。對該輪總船長斯頌馨·副總船長劉梁漢及該處海事課長兼該輪總船長室業務科長陳叔易等三人，依過失致死罪嫌，提起公訴。據稱：該漁康輪於去年七月九日，經交通部上海航政局派員檢騐後，核給證書尚有三個月之有效期，應於去年十月八日屆滿。迨至十月十一日出漁時，該輪船長王景昇因公前往青島，由闞肇元代理船長出漁。同月十五日，該輪在浙江沈家門與漁新輪相撞，船首受傷，即在當地雇木工修理，後船仍不時漏水，該輪船員認為纜續出漁，頗有危險，乃以無綫電向斯·劉二人請示，詎斯·劉據報，即電飭續行出漁，至同月二十五日，該輪返滬，經善後事業委員會船舶修理廠木工領班王也勃檢查，當查明該漁康輪水綫以下，被撞裂痕漏水，須進船塢修理，斯·劉以出漁獲益甚大，不欲停止，適原任船長王景昇自青公畢返滬，請求大加修理，亦不之許，並命王率領船員，繼續出漁，致該輪於十二月十四日中午，在浙江省象山縣南菲山東北海面（即東經一二二四五度，北緯二八五〇度），遭暴風雨襲擊沉沒，所有船上人員，計船長王景昇，副船長朱子鈞，輪機長黃航，二軌忻謁賓，漁夫長蔣國樑，漁撈員高同德，漁夫蔣阿祥·蔣汝芸·鄔學成·沈來章·吳坤興及實習生施某等同遭溺斃。後經該處獲悉，派船赴救，僅撈得蔣阿祥屍體一具運滬。各被害人家屬以該處處長趙君邁，副處長王以康及斯·劉·陳等均有犯罪嫌疑，乃聯名狀請偵查。</p>

<h3>安慶橋頭堡之戰</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報安慶十日訊〕安慶會戰負責指揮的第八綏靖區司令官夏威副司令官徐啟明，參謀長諸葛曙，軍長譚何易，守軍師長吳中堅。　我們將夏威將軍等的名字，聯貫推算，可以演成一段有趣味的測字，巧妙地顯示安慶之戰，國軍有可操左券的前途。</p>
<p>「夏陽之威」，共軍早已心懼胆寒，這次國軍的幕僚長，是位「諸葛先生」，他能借東風，在「曙光普照」之下，徐徐給予人們「啟示，前途光明」，安慶守軍，是中流砥柱，守而必堅」，所以共軍想奪取此一橋頭堡，「譚何易事。」</p>
<p>—安慶會戰插曲—</p>
<p>淮北戰事結束後，共軍的攻擊指標，就曾經注示江北橋頭堡中的安慶，因為以地形論，它是南京的屛藩，武漢的左臂，以會戰前的態勢論，當時那方面的守軍指揮機構—第八綏靖區—正奉命調整，交替防務，它就乘隙而下，冀一舉而下安慶，奪此長江中流的一個橋頭堡，以為爾後渡河點。</p>
<p>當面共軍兵力，有兩個軍，它的作戰地界，以安慶北面白兎湖·菜子湖·通城湖，以及棕陽為界，以東是陳毅，以西是劉伯誠。　劉伯誠的十五軍，所屬四三，四四兩個師在太湖，四五師在宿松，十一軍所屬三一，三二，三三等師，和一個獨立師，皖西基幹旅，三個基幹團，担任這次安慶正面的主攻，據軍方估計，共軍在正面作戰的兵力，有五萬人，雖然在這十幾日來的衝殺苦鬥，死傷近二萬，但是，它的兵力，似乎一再保持這個數字。</p>
<p>安慶守軍，吳中堅部，在徐淮會戰時，剛由後方調來的一個後備旅所補充的一支隊伍，要說，在廣西訓練不到半載的新兵，馬上担負這次艱困的任務，實非易事。</p>
<p>譚何易軍長，昨天談到安慶橋頭堡守備戰鬥十七天的經過，他說：這個戰鬥，在目前講，可分為三期：</p>
<p>第一期：在四十里舖，獅子山附近的戰鬥，是前哨戰，自三月廿一日午刻，共軍獨立師一部八百餘，及皖西獨立旅主力二千餘，分別向我四十里舖及獅子山（均安慶北廿公里附近）附近的國軍警戒都隊攻擊，戰鬥到廿二日晨，守軍以警戒任務已達，乃逐次向集賢關附近的第一抵抗綫撤歸。</p>
<p>第二期：在集賢關附近，在三月廿二那天，共軍的十一軍三十一師與獨立師，皖西獨立旅，均先後到達戰塲，向集賢關國軍的第一抵抗綫，展開攻擊戰鬥，到廿四日集賢關失而復得，形成拉鋸之勢，國軍為求得有利態勢，縮小正面集結兵力，繼續完成任務計，於廿四日夜自動向第二抵抗綫轉移，部署了一條與守軍現有兵力相配合而理想守備的一綫，因為吳中堅師長所統率的口口師，以有限的兵力，祖負廣正面的守備，是不容易，徒在對方的以大吃小戰術下加重自己的傷亡。</p>
<p>第三期：在安慶城郊棋盤山·五里墩·樟木冲之綫，是現階段的第二抵抗綫，共軍於守軍調整佔領第二抵抗綫之際，繼續進逼其十一軍後續兩師—三十二，三十三師—及三個基幹團，一個砲兵團，亦於廿五日增援到達，挾其數倍的優勢，向國軍陣地猛攻，尤以城東郊棋盤山農塲方面，更為激烈，計自二十四日迄四月四日止，每日夜的戰况：</p>
<p>廿四日夜至廿七日夜不分畫夜全綫激戰，經守軍英勇抵抗，共軍未逞。</p>
<p>三十日，畫間略趨沉寂，入幕後全綫猛攻至卅一日夜，攻勢仍烈，其間棋盤山及農塲兩據點，曾一度失守，旋經守軍逆襲克復</p>
<p>四月一日晝間沉寂，黃昏砲戰，歷二小時，繼之以全綫猛攻衝鋒達十數次，均未獲逞。</p>
<p>四月四日，共軍續挖對壕再攻未逞，國軍以有力一部向東出擊，攻佔太湖閘，及其東二千公尺之綫，進攻的共軍，在那短短的一夭，傷亡在二千以上，被俘一百十餘人，其對壕戰術，全被粉碎。</p>
<p>安慶橋頭堡之戰，自三月廿一日開始，到四月六日，整整十七天，較諸抗戰時，名震中外的衡陽會戰十七天，精彩的二次長沙會戰—五天—，更是苦鬥了五天的三倍，四倍。</p>
<p>這次安慶之戰，可說是最精采的一戰。</p>

<h3>興修金武輕便鐵道</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　蔣風</p>
<p>〔本報金華四日訊〕金武鐵道，這短短五十公里的路綫，是一部血淚的歷史。</p>
<p>當三十一年初夏，敵人在浙贛路發動大舉攻勢，企圖打通浙贛鐵路，實現其「東亞大陸走廊」的迷夢。金華武義等地，就在那次攻勢中陷入敵手。當時，敵人採悉金武等地盛產氟石，曾派遣專家詳密調查，認為武義氟礦蘊藏豐富而且品質佳良；所以就强拉民伕，興建金武輕便鐵道，金華附近民衆在鞭笞下完成了金武綫的土方工程，不到半年時間，金武鐵道就在國人慘痛的心緒下貫通了，通車以後，敵人盡其全力掠刦武義氟石，直至前夕。在三十四年春，敵人擬撤離金華，始將金武綫鋼軌橋料折卸他運，僅留下一條路基，如今也殘破不堪了。</p>
<p>這路沿綫，物產頗衆，尤以氟石為著，估計每日可產四百噸，繼續達五十年之久。不久以前，曾有德籍地籍礦冶專家受美商江南公司之邀前來調查，認為武義氟石質純量宏，推全世界最大氟石礦之一，估計每噸可得凈盈美金七八元，每月可銷五六千噸，以之出口換取外匯，甚具經濟。另據可靠調查，武義縣每年輸出農產品八萬餘噸，竹紙草紙等三十五萬噸，棉織品輸入約二萬噸，將來修復通車後，每日貨運估計有一三〇〇噸。此外，縣東北郊距城二公里至五公里地區產煤，離城二十公里之岑上·烏溪·淸溪等鄉產鐵砂，將來亦可能大規模開採。</p>
<p>由於金武支綫在經濟上價値甚大，所以當沈成章主浙之時，卽有興修該路作為杭溫鐵道之一段的計劃，後以路款籌措問題及沈成章氏他調之事實的制限，這項計劃曾經一度擱置。及陳公洽接沈蒞任後，發表興修金武鐵道，開採武義氟石以換取鐵路器材，興建全省輕道網的大計劃，並經陳任建設廳長貢沛誠氏奔波接洽，似均已安排就緒，原有在去年年底前開工之可能。</p>
<p>但是，不久戰局轉進，京滬疏散聲起，金武支綫之修築事宜，再度擱置。直到最近周喦氏主浙，又以舊事重提，訂擬「興建輕便鐵道計劃」一種，以「先求其通，後求其備」的原則下，發展山區交通，輸送礦產。擬以本省將產氟石向外洋售出，換取外匯購置必需材料，並利用民工興修之。</p>
<p>實施程序已經決定，本年內先行興築下列三綫：</p>
<p>（一）金（華）武（義）綫，長五十公里，為便於運輸武義氟石。</p>
<p>（二）金（華）溫（州）綫之上（茭道）縉（雲）段，約長六十公里，現準備測量工作，俟武義氟石向外洋換得鋼軌後，卽可建築。</p>
<p>（三）杭甬綫之甬百段，等日本鋼軌運到後卽可修築。</p>
<p>從上項計劃看，浙省當局已決定將金武綫列入第一期興修工程之首，想不久卽有開工之望。</p>
<p>早在陳公洽主浙之初，便曾成立浙省輕便鐵道籌備處，向浙贛鐵路借調正工程師駱繼綱担任籌備處主任。接着，浙贛鐵路亦於今年元旦在金華成立金武支綫籌備處，仍派駱繼綱為主任，並加派陳昌言為正工程師兼副主任；積極準備開工事宜。</p>
<p>今年一月二十二日，由駱主任及浙省財政廳主任曾子唯來金華，召集金華·武義·蘭谿·湯溪·遂昌·龍游·衢縣等縣縣長及民意代表，舉行談話會，商討金武綫興工事項，當塲決定由金武沿綫各縣負責征購不足枕木三萬五千根，每根枕木市價折合中白米二十四市斤，由省方負担半數，各到會縣份共同負担半數，各縣攤購枕木數量，由省方根據各縣賦額及營業稅額決定之，並且限定三月內全部征足。</p>
<p>枕木問題已經順利解決外，沿綫三座大橋，卽金華江長一六〇公尺，八仙江長一三〇公尺，白楊江長一六〇公尺，共計跨區總長五五〇公尺，所需橋料鋼梁，曾由籌備處電請交通部移撥聯總物資內指撥予津浦路而仍堆存於上海張華浜橋梁塲內之ESTB軍用鋼梁，據說原則上也無甚問題。　其他，機車已由湯恩伯氏籌劃購置，客貨用車輛由交通部撥發。鋼軌已決定借用淮南路堆存於上海之現貨，並且可能在月內全部運來此間備用。</p>
<p>施工所需用的二千分之一平面圖及四千分之一縱剖面圖，前綫派遣測量隊自上月十八日開始工作，可於今日測抵武義城郊。記者此次巡禮武義氟礦時，在途中曾見負責測量工作人員在大雨中工作最近半月來，霪雨不已，但該隊二十餘位工作人員，在極困陋情况下進行工作，可能在極短促時間內完成任務，工作情緒之佳，在今日局面下，實足感佩。</p>
<p>自各方面看，金武輕便鐵道之修復工程，準備工作大部完畢，巳進入「萬事皆備，僅缺東風」之境。金武沿綫人民都期望着政府當局迅卽撥發作為「東風」的工款，使這條曾經由老百姓付過血的代價而被敵人奴役過的金武綫，早日成為服役於老百姓而繁榮農村經濟的動脈。記者就此祝福它早日復活！</p>

<p>由上列調查資料看，已經可以君出武義與礦蘊藏至廣且豐。所以，在敵人經營期間，曾在武義南門外，興建占地三十五畝之大規模煉砩廠，全部為鋼骨水泥造成，並有蓄水池貯水塔等設備，附近且有水力發電廠。在蔣萬洞等礦區內，建有工人住宅四十餘幢，及小形發電廠一座。在各礦內，均有輕便鐵道綱佈。記者此次特了專程去武義礦區巡禮，除金武輕便鐵道之橋梁鋼軌枕木均為敵人在勝利前拆卸運走外，僅留路基土方之礦區亦多破壞，礦道均為傾圯的廢石所蔽；工人住宅亦已破敗不堪。城南之煉砩廠，惟留矗慫雲霄的大烟囱，仰向長天嘆氣，供人憑吊而已。</p>
<p>勝利三年，時間在內戰中消逝。敵人為國人留下粗具規模之礦坑，竟無暇且無力規復，一任其堙沒，誠可惋惜。最近浙省當局一再倡議恢復金武鐵路，重開武義氟石，且禁止民間開採外運；但政府計劃已久，尙未至實施階段。因此，本來民間零星開採者，亦因一紙禁止外運的命令而全部停工。記者巡禮礦區之餘，感到武義之與氟礦，不但質佳量多，且交通便利，亟宜規復。在此僅以虔誠之意，希望政府當局迅卽舖設金武鐵道，官商聯設礦務公司，購置機械，從事大規模之開採。此不僅關係浙江中部農村經濟之榮枯，且及國計民生。</p>

<h3>龍井訪茶</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十日訊〕馳譽中外的龍井茶葉，宅是產在杭州的名勝區獅峯，龍井，雲栖與虎跑，其中以獅峯所產為最優，龍井次之，其他更次之。獅峯是傍龍井的一座高山，也可以說屬於龍井的地區，因此，茶葉以龍井得名。</p>
<p>去龍井的路，一可由經九溪十八澗而往，一可由去北山的靜江路到「雙峯插雲」碑亭處左側折入大小徑，此小徑也可以通汽車的，直達籠井山脚下。九溪十八澗與龍井附近的山巒，儘是童山濯濯，惟獨龍井寺附近，還保留着不少的古木，遙望像是一隻開了屛的孔雀，牠獨特地向衆山驕傲着</p>
<p>登龍井山，曲折的石級天然佈置着綠葉叢叢的樹林，還有一口不大不小的池子，古籐盤繞在四週，漸上而達龍井寺，在龍井寺的茶亭中，可以遙瞰西子湖，進假山洞，便有一口龍井，原來這井就是山泉，在新睛之後水面上可以看到一條分水綫，雖以棒挑撥，仍奮存在，據說山泉原含有礦質的雨落下來後不能與山泉混淆，卽成各半的兩面，待雨水流盡，又不見分水綫了。</p>
<p>遜淸乾隆數度到此，住一二天返城，此處確是淸幽恬適，盛交可以避暑，為南山中最高雅的地區。昔年胡適亦來此，見不少古代石碑，盡作墊石因寫文惜之，現在一部份經寺僧起出，如龍井之井欄是，其餘已湮沒不見了。</p>
<p>步出龍井寺數百步，竹林夾道而至龍井村，村上一百零四戶人家，盡以種茶為業，這村子傍九溪而築，涓涓流水經過這村莊而歸流到十八澗內，瀕水的人家，建有小小的石橋，屋內都有炒茶的灶頭，屋前曠塲上豢養着鷄鴨成羣，但甚為整潔，村人衣衫潔凈，面目淸秀，好像有些世外桃源的樣子。</p>
<p>鄰近諸山，都植着矮矮地一堆堆的茶樹，矗立雲霄的獅子峯，望上去茶樹種得像滿盤的圍棋。</p>
<p>記者來杭州將及三年，足跡遍各名勝風景區，終以龍井一帶風景最為優勝。凡是到杭州來玩的人，總是介紹他們這是一個好去處，卅六年春田漢，應雲衛，吳天三位來杭，也在此獲得靈感而寫下了「憶江南」的電影劇本。</p>
<p>淸明時節，龍井又是一番新鮮的氣象，採茶的男男女女，揹着簍筐爬登茶山，摘着幼嫩的芽茶，龍井村上，家家戶戶都敞開着大門，放着桌子和椅子，桌子上舖着白檯布，置着放茶葉的玻璃瓶和幾隻茶杯，在門上貼着「本戶出售龍井芽茶」的字條。以便遊客們一噹佳茗後來購取的。</p>
<p>據龍井寺當家永暢吿訴我：龍井之有茶，年代很久，宋時蘇東坡常來寺中，（當時寺名為「廣福」），與辨才老方丈品茗暢談。至淸乾隆來寺中，村人以茶葉享乾隆，嘆為佳品，並往參觀，所至處有茶樹十八棵，故有謂十八棵御茶者。戰前胡適使美，每年託上海程姓來寺購取龍井茶十斤，以享美國總統羅斯福。因以外人來購者亦漸多。我曾訪問茶戶，知道一畝茶樹，好茶產四五十斤，較差的茶產一担的，茶地也要施肥拔草，肥料為糞便菜餅等，抗戰時期，因為沒有施肥，有許多茶樹都已老去，所以近來產量已較戰前减少。茶樹最好植在山地上，更好是沙山地，獅峯，娛蚣廟附近為最好，因該處為白沙山地。十八棵御茶就在此處。</p>
<p>茶葉摘下來後要經過炒，炒是用手的，灶下燒着緩緩的文火與急急的旺火，炒好幾遍才能算成功。炒後還有人把陳茶拼，一說與陳茶拱了才有香味。今年炒工每月供膳宿要五担米，摘工大約要五百元一兩，成本計算，大約明前茶出售，每斤價錢要一担米的光景。去年遊客特多，龍井茶產約五六千担不够銷，茶商有以臨安，餘杭，紹興等地的茶葉來代替龍井出售的。雖然龍井村上的茶生意很好，龍井村的氣氛是那麼恬淡安適，但是村上的人家，多半是窮的，因為他們在採茶時節，沒有資本，只好向茶商借，等到出茶了，有一斤就要把一斤批賬，等茶價高了，利潤他們享受不到，白白地忙碌了一番。至於想整理茶地，種植新茶，更是談不到了。</p>
<p>我總想像這樣有名的龍井茶，應該要把它再進一步的加以改良，如保持永久的色香味等，但終因種茶的人家顧全生活之不暇，許多有志農業的專家們，也還沒有把目光投到龍井茶的身上來。</p>
<p>今年烽火逼近，龍井茶又受了一個打擊！</p>

<h3>套匯交易雨後春筍　銀元抬頭金鈔失色</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀元昨日套匯，因茶汎將屆，汛帮銀元套匯特多。據悉，有十餘家套出大批銀元匯款，匯水升達五元，（百元多匯升一〇五元），有做五天期，對方付現，有做票　二天付現者，此次匯款，大多轉套屯溪·婺源·等處。湘帮雖套出零星匯款，共約五萬元左右，匯率為每百元升二元。萬縣套匯，每百元升水一元，亦有做直過者。蓋萬縣銀元亦有砌高所致，漢口帮有銀元款套入，匯出不聞做開，滬多票匯，見票遲三天付現，遲一天者折付金圓，數量不大。反之金圓套來者則頗湧。</p>
<p>南昌米帮有大量銀元套出，每百元升水一至三元不等。北平昨日聞某大樓申莊一家，套出美金五百元，匯水直過，福州銀元套匯，南貨帮有套出，匯率每百元十五元。上項套出之統計數字，因額數散漫，故確計至為不易，而各帮套做者，均因於法有抵觸，非有特殊關係者，實難以探求其底蘊。</p>
<p>又據津帮商人語記者稱：北帮套匯銀元，數字將日見龐大，聞某有力人土，將在滬杭收購大批袁頭現貨，運往屯溪，以便套做匯款生意。惟山鄉收購毛茶，均以銀元計價，是以「津滬」「滬屯」之銀元套匯，為最近之大好生意。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元又露鋒芒，業巳壓倒黃金·美鈔，證券大樓對敲之字號，開盤進一兩黃金，換四八塊大頭，出一兩黃金，換五十塊大頭，繼做小至四七，四九，四六，四八，最後午收仍做四七，四九。午後步低至四六，四八，四五，四七收盤。</p>
<p>小頭尚平，仍做六〇，六五。龍　洋自九〇，九五，一路小至八八，九三，午後低至八七，九二。其他大頭對小頭，比例平穩，仍為八〇對一〇〇，大頭對龍鷹洋，亦仍為六〇對一〇〇，大頭對美鈔，十元反升至十一元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕馬路交易，因工廠傾力吸收，更以月中將屆，各方需求殷切，人心看好，執戶出少進多。</p>
<p>晨間尚平，大頭喊七萬，七萬三，一路升至七三，七八，七五，八〇。瀕午高至七八，八二，午後又高至八萬，八萬五，小頭喊六萬五，七萬，龍鷹洋喊四萬五，五萬。本票交易，大頭最後喊八萬五，九萬，錢兌帮對敲大頭，隔日做高至八萬七，九萬二，已迫九關，較上日又跳一萬。</p>
<h3>國行昨仍拋售黃金　場外一度竄出四關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市場，央行因以三六〇萬元價格，在場外拋金後，以各方胃口不佳，乃以迅雷不及掩耳之勢，在十時左右，以黑市價格三六〇萬，在場內委托大德成金號，無限制拋售，一路甩小至三四五萬，共出一一九七六條。</p>
<p>按昨日照章規定漲限為三二八萬四千，而央行竟打破漲限，以黑市高價拋金，與章則不符。按漲跌限度二成，係財部所頒黃金員賣辦法規定，央行未及先期呈准財部修改施行，各金號咸表驚訝。午後因人影稀疏，未有交易</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕場外現貨交易，晨開因央行壓力重重，開盤三三五萬，三四五萬，中途逢低有吸，證券帮吸胃旺盛，一度高至三六五萬，三七五萬，瀕午低至三五〇萬，三六〇萬收市。</p>
<p>午後隔日交易，開盤三七五萬，三八五萬，中途因北帮，山西帮，去化活躍，一度穿出四關，高達四一〇萬，四二〇萬。</p>
<p>央行委托大德成，兆豐昌，雙管齊下，以隔日頭寸四〇〇萬，一路拋小至三七五萬，連續拋出一七〇〇大條，人心轉軟，收盤低至三八〇萬，三九〇萬，除息四〇萬，較上日軋高二〇萬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日場外期貨交易，上午開市三三〇萬，三四〇萬，曾高至三九〇萬，三九五萬，午收低至三五三萬，三五八萬。午後開市三九〇萬，三九五萬，低至三八八萬，三九三萬。各帮搜求轉烈，一路升至四一八萬，四二三萬，收市低至四〇七萬，四一二萬，多室貼息開每兩為四十萬元，差金桔價，按四〇〇萬計算。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日美鈔場外交易仍稀，趨勢不及銀元之硬紮，晨開七萬一，七萬四，曾高至七萬五，七萬八，午收七萬三，七萬六。午後隔日交易，開八萬二，八萬七，曾升至八萬四，八萬九。收市八萬三，八萬六，除息八千，較上日軋升七千元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀樓飾金，晨開平定，仍掛三三〇萬，三六五萬。瀕午升至三三五萬，三七〇萬。午後高至三六〇萬，四〇〇萬，較上日再漲三〇萬，飾銀尚穩，進價掛高五千，為三萬五，出價未更，仍為四萬五，錢兌業烚赤掛牌，上午為三五〇萬，三七〇萬，下午升至三七〇，三九〇萬。</p>
<h3>市塢銀根堅俏</h3>
<p>昨晨市場銀根已見秀俏，緣各市物價均已先後竄至高峯，市拆亦追踪砌升，昨晨拆借最低價為千元日拆六十元，是高為一五〇元。市場以前日央行場外拋售黃金，銀根初鬆後緊，各業人士雖感物價已達頂峯，惟腳地欠穩，日內央行或將大量拋售，物價將有回　。昨晨各市價仍多徘徊堅途，尚未開創新紀錄。各貨帮貼息證券六十元與六十五元，紗布一〇〇元，人造絲廠經一一〇元，綢縀九〇至一〇〇元，糖一五〇元，日用品捲煙一一〇元。</p>
<h3>金管局派員　檢查行莊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金管局為加緊調查各行莊業務，昨晨續派稽核人員八組，分赴各行莊檢查賬冊及一般業務云。</p>
<h3>貼放會例會　通過生產農貸案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會，昨下午四時舉行第卅四次例會，李馥蓀代理主席，討論通過交通公用工礦生產事業及農貸等案件多起。</p>
<h3>外匯證轉穩</h3>
<p>外匯移轉證書，昨日市況，已轉穩定，晨開五八〇〇〇元，散戶略有吸進，曾升至六〇〇〇〇元，嗣以銀根緊俏，人心虛軟，午收退為五九〇〇〇元，與前高價成平局，較前收盤價微升二百元。</p>
<h3>龍井堅檔盤旋</h3>
<p>本年杭州「雨前」新龍井，約於本週內即可運滬應市。茲據業中人云：該地雖得天獨厚，故出品較浙省溫州為佳，惜今年因雨水失調，是以茶身不及往年鮮嫩，一般茶農茶商，對此咸表不滿。至於溫州新龍井，到源依然不絕，而品質日形蒼老，同業拆價，本有下游之　，但自業外物資與運費，循環上揚後，成本一再加重，因此尚在原途掙扎。其他花色，銀根比前雖歛，惟人心不餒，遂猶堅擋盤旋。</p>
<h3>局勢日就好轉　華股再見上揚</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股市況，昨承隔夜餘悄，漲勢持續。過去因受時局牽制，及外來環境威脅，市程落後巳久，近因大局緩和，羣眾矚目。昨日銀根走勢雖略見緊象，但頭寸供源仍暢，多頭心理全面展開，市勢堅盤後終告上升。</p>
<p>永紗晨開三十六元五角，因連漲有日，銀根又緊，隔夜多頭頻了，市程略軟，挫至卅五元五角八角，為開盤後之最低價。浮空急補，現貨籌碼軋緊，人心突悄，各帮頻納，升至四十元〇七角。嗣聞黃金回疲，央行又壓，檯面乘高吐售，市勢頓挫，盤旋於三九元八九角。旋聞永紗貼息，開出為六〇元六五元，大戶力托，升至四一元三角，散戶競售，臨收三九元三角。</p>
<p>中小型股晨開均疲，午收回升，信和八元三角高至九元五角漲停，新光前市沉寂，臨收飛升高至三元一角一漲停。勤興景福先平後升，雜股商務開復見八元九九漲停，閘北上泥內衣麗安臺糖等均告漲停，餘股亦俏。</p>
<p>午後銀根轉鬆，行局各地匯款湧到，支撥頻繁，暗息退六七角。圈外黃金再升，買風仍熾，永紗初做四三元八角，四四元三角，中間微軟微盤，走勢屹立，終至四四元四角收盤。申請了結交易開盤四〇元，嗣後一路盤升，高至四三元二角收市。</p>
<p>中小型股了結交易，美亞一元一角三漲停，新光三元一角一，景福一元四六，勤興二元〇八分，內衣一元一角五，永公九元五角，統益一三元二角，中火二二元八角，臺糖八四六七〇元，中法八元二九，均告漲停。</p>
<h3>金債趨升　外股軋小</h3>
<p>黃金公債市勢續俏，和談接近，人心樂觀，圈外物挺，買氣轉佳。晨開一三五萬買進，一路升至一五三萬，嗣聞金價疲軟，進戶觀望，市價亦見回軟，臨收又告上揚，終以一五八四〇〇〇元漲停收市。</p>
<p>後市初做一五五萬買進，嗣升至一五八四〇〇〇元，軋漲二六四〇〇〇元，成交三七兩。</p>
<p>外股昨因銀根轉緊，買氣銳減，市勢稍疲。怡紗九萬，九萬二，跌落二千元。英聯九萬五，九萬八，回小八千元。怡啤一萬七，－萬八，小一千元，業廣三萬三進，無賣出。亞洲九千一，九千三。會德豐喊三五萬進，無賣出。</p>
<h3>頭寸緊·暗息高　食米稍轉下挫　白粳臨收做四十萬元</h3>
<p>昨日米市轉疲，緣因前日上漲過鉅，市上頭寸緊俏，暗息高昂，開市貨主求售者頗多，各檔貨一律挫落三五萬元不等。後市金價報漲，各方乘低有吸，市勢止跌回升。白粳臨收四十萬，隔日款做四十二萬元，較上日挫落萬元。北市情彩穩定，白粳乃站卅八萬。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>一致趨疲，市場和平室氣濃厚，且銀根緊俏，散戶紛紛脫售求現，廠豆油挫落廿萬，生菜油跌進二百關，生油來貨不多，微挫十萬元，蔴油貨主扳高，市勢平定，吉桶小車仍做二百卅五萬，豆餅先挫後回，長字餅做十二萬八千元。</p>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>市勢盤堅，初市至收市前，因銀根緊俏，米價疲落，人心虛軟，進戶多存觀望，深恐央行大量拋售，市勢均在疲途盤旋。迄收市未聞央行有拋售，市場買氣頓轉濃厚，市勢遂告上揚。老車喊做十四萬六千元，兵船以十四萬三千五百元最後成交，較昨微升二千元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>全面回挫，惟紅糧以到貨瀕絕，市場供不應求，在各物齊小聲中，市勢獨挺成餘，叩廿萬大關，黃豆步步趨疲，苞米挫落萬元，芝蔴交易旺盛，生仁未做開。</p>
<h3>市場散步</h3>
<p>— 看臺客</p>
<p>銀元套匯交易中　加緊對農村抽血</p>
<p>雜牌銀元叫屈　似有倒袁運動</p>
<p>銀元套匯，已有不少行莊，在搶做中。</p>
<p>此風既開，全國各地銀元，將被納胃最大的上海一地，鯨吞下去了。</p>
<p>民廿四年冬，白銀收回國有日起，通都大色的存銀，多數已轉為紙幣，唯有保守性極大的農村中，可有藏銀習慣。</p>
<p>現在市面上流通的銀元，恐怕已是多數來目農村。銀元通匯之後，各地銀元流滬速度，勢將加強。</p>
<p>無疑的，這就都市資本向廣大農村抽血的工作。</p>
<p>「和　」「停戰」等樂觀空氣極濃，反映到市場上的，證券狂漲後再加碼狂漲，一般商品市場，則趨疲落。</p>
<p>人民需要和平，也需要解除高物價壓迫，和成，物價壓迫也同時解除。僅是樂觀空氣踏進市場，市場已是轉變，由此可知</p>
<p>但事實未曾確實實現前，仍不可「把鷄毛當令箭。」目前尚在忽寒忽熱中，市場進出，更要步步留心。</p>
<p>月中發薪在邇，銀元漲勢益盛。</p>
<p>袁大頭時代驕子；帆船·孫頭·鷹洋·龍洋·等大量落後。論成色，重量，都不應如此拔開，許多人為孫頭等抱怨。</p>
<p>其實，不必抱怨，只要目已有數，「人賤則進，人貴則棄」，原是猶太人的主要秘密。有一天「看齊令」一到，有怨也能出頭了。</p>
<p>最近市間盛傳央行有改鑄袁頭之說。央行的否認，自是事實；但類此消息，決不會消滅，今後還可能變本加厲地說說翻新哩。</p>
<p>要知，這就是「倒袁運動」的開始，既有人發動，自有成功之一日。</p>
<p>同樣的，最近花旗黯至失色。</p>
<p>八一九時，以二銀元折一美鈔，巳是虐待。現在一對一，更屬虐之尤虐。</p>
<p>我以為也不必叫屈，只要肚裏有數好了暴利的發祥地，總是在不近情理時留下種子的。</p>
<p>請十分留心，會動腦筋的猶太籍的美英商人，有一且，會有「袁大頭」舶來品上市，掉走美鈔的可能。</p>
<p>黃金市場，又進入一個新階段；就是天天漲停。唯有天天漲停，場外價才能站住</p>
<p>隔晚場外略售，翌晨一開補進。午後再略供售，明晨一開再補。如此做法，賺進利息，又賺進價鈿，並且是保險的。</p>
<h3>棉紗回輭</h3>
<p>棉紗市況平疲，複製業納胃達飽和，轉取觀望態度，加以銀根報緊，日拆高至一元二角，客帮亦一致止進，但執戶仍少脫手，故場內交易不多。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳初開二五五〇萬元，中途曾進展至二八五〇萬元，臨收復趨下游，終為二六〇〇萬元，較前降一〇〇萬元。</p>
<p>三二支銀月微挫一〇萬元，以一六一〇萬元結局。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨始以一二七〇萬元開出，一度叩一三〇〇萬元，收市一二三〇萬元，略跌四〇萬元，廠單仍與現貨距離一〇萬元。二〇支雙馬低八〇萬元，其餘各檔亦見帶小，惟一〇支童子軍及四平蓮反露秀色。</p>
<h3>布市軋跌</h3>
<p>昨日布市始低繼償，銀根走勢轉緊，且連日奔騰過厲，人心有所顧慮，晨初各方咸抱觀望姿態，買賣俱稀，嗣後本街門莊逢低吸進，市乃略堅，結果較上日後市仍見軋跌。</p>
<p>龍頭細布自四十三萬五千元拉至四十五萬五千元為最高，近午曾低見四十三萬元，午收四十四萬三千元，終挫二萬二千元。</p>
<p>四君子嗶嘰晨開四十萬元，最高達四十三萬元，最後以四十二萬八千元午收，軋降八千元。一九〇高檔士林廠盤破一百萬大關，後市買氣轉濃，因業外均皆挺秀，初開龍頭細布四十七萬一千元，四君子嗶嘰四十六萬元，收市前者四十八萬五千元，後者四十七萬四千元，較午收軋漲四萬二千元至四萬六千元不等。</p>
<h3>絲綢榮辱互見　人絲小被面升</h3>
<p>生絲昨晨開優級另擔，為二一〇〇萬元，午收仍為二一〇〇萬，與前市相埒，鮮有榮辱。</p>
<p>人絲昨晨開即期，天橋與斯尼亞為一二五〇萬元，午收明票交易升為一三五〇萬元，較昨午收小三〇萬元，良以人心虛軟之故。</p>
<p>綢縀華強被面，晨開為八四〇萬元，午收升為八七五萬元，較前午收升十二萬八千四百元，均普升成許。</p>
<p>市價一覽</p>

<h3>乒乓須知</h3>
<p>下面想順便談談足部的運用：</p>
<p>（一）把足的前部支持體重　把身體的重心放在足的前部，可以使身體輕便敏捷，有了敏捷的活動，才能作敏銳的攻擊。要是重心常放在足跟，身體就不能運用自如，戰鬥精神因此不免減色，到了這個地步，就祗有防襲的能力了。</p>
<p>（二）屈膝部使身體稍向前傾　屈膝部，可以使身體向前傾，使重心移向前方。這樣就全身像彈條，任何方向都可以應付自如。對於正手或是反手球都有絕大的好處。</p>
<p>（三）兩足要成斜綫　預備打球之際，兩足的位置有兩種說法：一種是平行說，使兩足與乒乓網保持平行；一種是斜綫說，聯結兩足的綫與網的延長綫間，保持相當的角度。兩足平行時，左右運動比較的容易，但欠缺前後移動的便利。所以通常兩腳與網是保持二十度角的居多。</p>
<p>（七）拍乒乓的三個時期</p>
<p>練習乒乓可以分做三個時期：第一期是初學時期；第二期是訓練時期；第三期是熟練時期。</p>
<p>在學習時期要把全副精神集中在球的一點上，因為球在臺上跳動的位置，球速，球的轉動速度，球的轉方向等，在球著臺以後，可以曉得進行的方向。同時要注意還擊出去的球，打在球拍的中部，打球在拍的中部是很困難的，但球拍的中部反發力最強，並且各種打法也可以正確；球拍的四邊返發力減少，而運用各種拍法，也很少把握ｉ，所以在初學時期要密切注意著球，同時要注意還出的球紀紀打在球拍的中部。</p>
<p>在這一個時期，不宜模仿熟練的乒乓家打球，而濫打硬球，要留心不觸網，不出臺，充分的約束著球，把球打在底綫的一尺以內，並且要先練習執拍的手在自己身體前面的拍好，再次練習執拍的手曳向後的拍法，到這兩種拍法學會了，才好練習旁破衡擊。</p>
<p>在每還拍一紀球以後，要刻刻準備著還拍下一紀來球，因為刻刻準備，方能隨時應付，否則會遭意外的襲擊，而束手無策的。</p>
<p>能把打出的球差不多紀紀可以打在拍的中部，紀紀可以打在對方的檯面上以後，才好算完畢第一期的課程。</p>
<p>在訓練時期，應該注意矯正自己的弱點，練習各種拍法，自己少一種拍法，是多一個破綻，對方多疑個襲擊機會。並且還要會得節省體力，應該攻的地方才攻，應該守的地方是守，不是守，不妄動，敏捷應付，以為長久的戰鬥。</p>
<p>除此以外，還要留心對手的動作，因為明白對方的動作，可以預知對方還球的方向。觀察的方法大約有下列幾點：</p>
<p>一，打球前及打球時的腕，拍，身體的姿勢等；</p>
<p>二，彼我的位置及打球姿勢；</p>
<p>三，對方與乒乓繼的位置；</p>
<p>四，球拍的位置；</p>
<p>五，對方的癖好及常套手段的研究。</p>
<p>能夠注意上面的幾點，那麼對方拍出忽樣的球，是不難預測的。</p>
<p>在這一個時期不單要矯正自己的弱點，練習各種拍法，注意對方的動作，同時還要訓練自己的手和腳。訓練自己的手，是頂重要的事，但在拍球的時候，要是腳不活躍的幫忙，是不成功的。應付對方向的攻擊，一定要有臨機應變的處置，這種面面顧到的身手，是有賴於腳的活動的。</p>
<p>到了熟練時期，對打球的原理應該已經十分領會，球也打得很好了，對方通常的動作也已經看慣了。所以在這個時期的乒乓家限是平看的，要多作敵前的觀察，做自己還球的最後修正。</p>

<h3>籃聯甲二Ｂ　回力獲錦標</h3>
<p>籃聯甲二組昨晚三場，在市體育館舉行，最後一仗Ｂ組回力與警機，決該組首席，回力以五六對廿六大勝警機，造五戰捷之優異成績，其餘兩幕崇德敗於紅騎，浦水克晨友。</p>
<p>紅騎勝崇德（甲二Ｄ）五四——四八</p>
<p>浦水勝晨友（甲二Ｄ）四〇——卅二</p>
<p>回力Ｂ勝警機（甲二Ｂ）五六——廿六</p>
<p>壓軸甲二Ｂ決賽，回力Ｂ出戰警機，戰端開始，回力Ｂ王士德籃下首開記錄，爐鼎厚連鄭運中，回力Ｂ以六對〇領先，警機力供，古振基扳回一球後，但回力Ｂ攻勢依然，分數一路領先，警機陣腳鬆亂，常得不償失，上半時告終，回力Ｂ以廿對十一領先。</p>
<p>易籃再戰，雙方陣容各有調動，回力Ｂ打得更為順手，有鄭必中，警機難搓其氣，而守衛鬆弛不堪，常漏洞百出，於是任憑回力Ｂ蹂躪，全程告終，回力Ｂ以五六對廿六大勝。</p>

<h3>四屆乒乓聯賽　郵務今逢中行</h3>
<p>四屆上海乒乓聯賽，自昨晚起乙組已開始動員，各處場地除精總網葉兩處外，他如善保，郵思，信誼等數球室，雖未見寬大，但球迷住觀者頗眾，竟使場地負責者未能儘量容納，足見乒乓運動已引起各界人仕之興趣，實為主辦當局熱誠提倡之收穫也。</p>
<p>今晚（十三日）七時起續有六幕交鋒，計甲組一場，乙組五場，分在郵務國貨等五球室舉行，秩序如下：</p>
<p>中行——郵務　（甲組）七時正郵務</p>

<h3>陸裝籃球小勝培爾</h3>
<p>陸軍裝甲總司令部籃球隊，昨日下午五時半迎戰培爾於電路該部球場，裁判吳子彬，雙方實力伯仲，殺得難解難分，上半時各十一平手ｉ，易籃後比數密接，軒輊難分，陸裝卒以場地較熟，乃以卅八對卅五以一球半之差小勝培爾。</p>
<h3>四屆大專運動會　改在南市舉行</h3>
<p>第四屆大專運動會於上週六舉行第三次籌備會，決議（一）大會原定於四月卅日假滬江大學舉行，茲因該校位處滬東，交通不便，經費預算頗巨，為節省大會經費，改假南市體育場舉行，已得該場允許，日期照舊。（二）報名費及經費原定參加各校每校一石五斗，茲為減輕各校負擔，改為一石，不足之數仍請滬江設法籌備措之。（三）報名仍假圓明園路二〇九號商工院，報名時除交報名名單外ｕ，隨繳當日北市上白梗米價一石（郎期支票於上午十一時前繳付）。（四）場地設備組函請南市體育場擔任之。</p>
<p>又籌備會早已將報告名單分寄各校，如未收到者，可函寄滬江大學該會籌備處索取。</p>
<h3>草地網球對抗賽　香港再度克西貢</h3>
<p>﹝香港航訊﹞西貢網球選手，此次在法比賽完畢，順道經港返越，香港網球會居中接洽，與越方舉行對抗，對抗分草地和硬地舉行，前一個週末硬地網球結果，港方賴業觀雄勝兩單打及葉觀雄徐煒培一雙打，港方以三比二勝。上週末繼續舉行草地對抗賽，結果港方又以四比一獲得勝利，五場戰績如下：</p>
<p>葉觀雄　六比四　八比六　阿龍</p>
<p>文绥　三比六　六比三　六比三　徐煒培</p>
<p>葉觀雄　一比六　六比三　六比〇　文绥</p>
<p>葉觀雄　蔡惠全　五比七　六比四　六比四　文绥　阿龍</p>
<p>按蔡惠全圍我國台杯選手，最近甫自星洲歸來，此次與葉觀雄合作雙打，因蔡六閱月來未賞賽球，故求醫稍見生疏，常有錯誤發生。第一盤雖會以五比三領前仍被越將後來居上。第二盤開始後，葉觀雄奮發有為，蔡亦好轉，逐告獲勝。</p>
<p>總歡此次對抗賽中，葉觀雄之數場表演，頗傳佳評，認為確有前途之日人物。惜此法將都北未克萊港，未能與葉觀雄一較高下耳。</p>
<h3>勃郎維區稱霸澳洲</h3>

<h3>中航班師返滬　在青兩戰俱捷</h3>
<p>中航足球隊應青島市體育界之邀請，作足球友誼之切磋，一行十五人，由陸維森吳守衛率領，於上週六飛青作比賽兩場，首賽戰勝會敗華北盟主東北風之中青隊，（二比〇）第二場對青島聯隊，是日觀眾擁擠不堪，盛況不減滬上東青情形，被屏棄於門外之觀眾尤不乏人，查聯隊除中青原班人馬外復得天津商隊阜際名將格雷斯格與邱浦洛甫，及漢城隊好手申淑玹等助陣，交戰之下，中航海派作風，以五比一之紀錄取勝，全體人馬已於十一日搭機返滬。</p>

<h3>南市民主盃足球賽　螢光輸華光兩隻　今日四時半一場大夏戰磐隊</h3>
<p>華光足球隊昨在吳祺祥領導之下三軍用命，精神振作以二比零戰勝螢光，此為民主盃賽之一幕。上半時無紀錄，二秋皆由尚世琪打進，一在互易陣地後之三分鐘，一在最後九分鐘，螢光健將於洽與徐步蕓等均在中華書局印刷廠工作，最近該廠為增產鈔票，正日夜加班印製，不准請假，致昨日未能出場比賽，影響實力不小，然該隊在上半時仍能維持零對零之局面，已非易易。劉隆聲何家統及守門鄭通裕之表演殊為出色，若人馬到齊，螢光實為一不可輕視之組織，堪與任何強隊一決雌雄。華光得吳祺祥坐鎮中央，後方即少顧慮，前鋒即因此能發揮強大威力，取勝宜也。</p>
<p>華光足球隊昨由主人黃家邦率領搭夜車赴航遊覽，並乘便與環湖隊及之江大學舉行友誼比賽，星期五夜車返滬。</p>
<p>九洲隊因本星期日有青白鐵路大戰，需要養精蓄銳，準備大舉，故隊長孟義良請求將本星期五九洲對華光一場移至下週舉行，同時華光亦有杭州之行，故週五南市無戰事。又磐隊亦於下星期一作西子之遊。</p>
<p>華光</p>
<p>陳惠民　呂起堂　樂德樓　江雷　吳祺祥　顧爾錄　王連海　朱家錚　陳良鏈　錢允慶　尚世祺　關永常　陳宇偉</p>
<p>螢光</p>
<p>鄭通裕　黃立甫　何家統　李子雲　陶延富　張高楨　楊恒學　劉隆馨　朱文彬　李坤才　李明華</p>
<p>今日下午四時半南市續有民主盃足球賽一幕，大夏與磐隊相逢，裁判員王琳，巡邊談榮生·朱奕寶，雙方球員年事皆輕，富有奮鬥精神，演出場面定必緊臻，大夏衡綫堅強，腳頭硬壯，磐隊前綫靈活，錢銘身輕如燕，小動作尤為巧妙美麗，彼此旗鼓相當，勝負不可捉摸。陣綫如下：</p>
<p>大查</p>
<p>沈延冠　邵光銘　陳福來　黃會修　郁黎甲　季滬生　葉承龍　胡志妥　龐美雄　陳一飛　金錫祺</p>

<h3>九旬盃小型球　報名延長四天</h3>
<p>徐匯中學主辦之九屆九旬盃小型足球賽，原定昨日下午截止報名，現為各校得充分準備起見，特延長四天，至十六日（週六）截止，凡欲加入者可儘於是前日向徐家匯該校體育部辦理手續。</p>
<h3>上週足球評述</h3>
<p>上週兩幕甲組足球聯賽，無精彩可言，勝負亦無關大局。錢銘演出市長盃盟主之成績勝精武會。龍頭隊得風姨之助，繞以二比一之成績勝志超會；冠軍一席，將決於本週末青白對鐵路之戰，則足球季可於本月中旬結束。</p>
<p>精武小將除方認秋一人外，餘子俱不在狀態中，敬仁，志剛，郁琪等因從事於田徑練習，疲態頓露，演來遠不及理想，先後共失四球，除翟錫根與隆慶祥之各一頂，清脆地獲兩球外，其餘兩球無異於雙手拱送與人，一只乃由於陳惠民之離門過早，致演空城計，零一只陳良連踢著草皮，致為霍踢根所乘。四球中之三球，俱由頭攻進，可見錫路諸鋒之頭攻予精武之守將以極大之威脅，惜無射門之腳頭，失機層層。</p>
<p>在攻勢而言，精武在開場十分鐘時，其攻勢之銳予鐵路以壓迫，迨汪國光氣力不繼，前鋒缺一開路之內鋒，汪，吳，方，陳各有一記之急射，惜經驗未充，未能竟功。</p>
<p>鐵路拾吳炳浩而改用蓋子文充左翼，兩翼之速度，顯見增強，有兩翼齊飛之演出，此實為鐵路之最理想之前鋒綫，本週末出戰青白時不妨用此陣綫，得使錢綫增強其攻勢，抱背城借一之決心，足予青白以威脅也。</p>
<p>龍頭在季初演出尚有可取，邇來演出遠不如季初時之佳，價有龍頭見首不見尾之像。其糾結在於聯繫和比賽過多，球員已陷於疲乏之狀態中，其次則因各隊俱有進步而龍頭則仍在停滯之狀態中，無論在南市抵在逸園，每場比賽是靠力勝而乏智謀，祗靠直撲，直衡，硬射之踢法，在下半時僅風勢圍攻志超逾十五分鐘仍無所得，茍非得風姨之助陣和盛彼得之失慎，致志超失其氣勢，而再失一球，則龍頭之再於志超，實為可能。在防襲著落半只門，志超等於佈下兩重門戶，龍頭前鋒之進迫，處處被阻，姜昆，夏樹德從有機會。惜不語採用角度之射法而僅作直綫之硬射，強弩之尖亦能穿　　，俱為祺祥所阻及彼得所接，彼得有如阿斗而祺祥有若予龍，阿斗在趙雲之掩護下，祗是有驚無險，前鋒富有奮鬥精神，祗久經驗耳。（戚公）</p>

<h3>說謊篇</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>說謊之難，難在表情。</p>
<p>小孩子說謊，語猶未竟，嘴角已掛露心虛的笑紋；天眞的新聞記者製造「萬愚節」偽新聞時，亦復如是。這些人說謊話，表情（卽「做工」）都不到家。</p>
<p>世上有兩位著名的說謊家，其做工十分道地；其一為中國四川的楊妹，另一為已被歷史判刑以死的墨索里尼。前一位，不惜身受饑餓之苦，抱「人饑己饑」的精神，偽造駭人聽聞的「眞理」，—不食亦可圖存。她忍受了廿一天人世最大的痛苦（這痛苦是足以結束其生命的），為的不過要證明「饑餓不是社會問題」。世之說謊家出以悲天憫人的態度，所在多有，但能如楊妹之誠懇嚴肅，尙不多見。因此當時楊妹新聞一經出現，芸芸衆生，無不拍手擁護，寄以極大的厚望。</p>
<p>足見，卽使天大的說謊，只要「做工」道地，卽足令人信以為眞，至少亦必半信半疑。今之職業說謊家，雖皆以普救衆生為號召，但表情，做工，都嫌幼稚，因此不能取信於民。</p>
<p>另一位職業說謊家墨索里尼，雖然其做工稍差於咱們的「楊妹」，但却能「鞠躬盡瘁，貫澈始終」。他終年胡說，自謂替天行道，旨在解救普天下無數人民。第一次，他這樣說，人們不信；第二次，第三次，又不信；但他並不心灰，却說；「只要接連地說上一百次，人們便相信了」！墨翁得能在位廿餘年，蓋全仗此一法門耳。</p>
<p>以上兩大說謊能手的精神，大可為今之說謊家效法。</p>
<p>說謊家們！你們盡情地說吧。反正「人騙人，騙死人不償命」！就把這句俗語，奉為你們的「座右銘」如何？</p>
<h3>貓</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>一提起貓，我有好多話要說。——專講究貓的書呌「貓苑」，我不預備引證它一詞半句，來拉長我的文字。現在只談貓給我的印象。</p>
<p>在八九年前吧，家裏忽然來了一隻黑白色的雌貓。來了之後，竟不再走去。餵它飯，它就喫；捉了它放在膝上，它也不動。於是人家說：「貓來富，狗來窮，好得很呢！」我也認為好得很。隔了幾年，它却又悄悄地走了。為什麼原因，那時可不知道。但它留下了一隻小貓，是玳瑁色的，也還不壞。這隻小貓現在也已有了好幾代子孫，它乖巧得很，向我討魚骨頭喫的時候，竟會跟吧兒狗一般的直立起來，而且也能用兩隻前脚來接東西。在我喫飯的時候，一呼就到；在平時呢，喚來喚去也喚不到，不但喚不到，聽到了我的聲音，簡直睬也不踩，有時更故意走得遠遠。於是我有些生氣了，感覺到貓畢竟是勢利畜生，證以「貓來富」的俗語，更可判定貓是勢力畜生。那隻老貓的來而又去，一定是為了以前我家裏有魚肉可喫，後來却一天一天的减少了；同時它更找到了富有的新主人，當然要掉頭不返了。從此證明，我家裏固然很少葷腥可喫，有人家却比我們要好得多哩！</p>
<p>在一個多月前，那隻玳瑁貓也走掉了。隔了一星期，却又垂頭喪氣地回來了，它的體重差不多輕了一半。回來之後，立刻喫飯，喫的份量竟比平日要多上一倍。我於是揣測它出走的動機，是要去找一隻比較腥氣濃一些的飯碗，結果却幾乎餓死·從此又可證明，現在我家裏固然差不多已少有葷腥可喫，但附近好多人家恐怕簡直沒有葷腥，或許白飯也已發生問題了。否則，蓄貓成為習尙的江南，它那裏會一餓六七天呢？——從兩隻貓先後的出走，竟能使我悟到了一個現實生活的敎訓。</p>
<p>在淪陷時期，我對於貓是絕對崇拜的，不但「迎貓」，而且甘心做貓，曾經請朋友畫了一幅貓，我自已更題上一首詩道：「平生枉事讀龍韜，報國何嘗有一毫？鼠輩跳梁昏白晝，甘心化作老雄貓」。貓還只是貓，然而我對它的印象，却時時刻刻在變。現在，我雖還是甘心做貓，但決不願意做伏在貴婦人膝上的玩貓，我要做一隻捕捉跳梁黠鼠的老雄貓。至於花蔭戲蝶的貓，更是我所瞧不起的。——附記</p>
<h3>改作五萬</h3>
<p>— 卓之</p>
<p>報載，中央銀行方從美國運來大批五元的金圓券，原是去年限價時期定印的，今始裝運到埠，「遲來一步」，已無法流通市面。刻央行以損失甚巨，正追責任中，云云。</p>
<p>我覺得，追究責任倒是大可不必的。因為印五元券並沒錯，如果是美鈔，現在運到也並不遲。毛病只是出在通貨膨脹上面，所以如果尋根究底起來，倒是大家不大好看的。</p>
<p>然而，這一大批外國印來的鈔票，棄之自然可惜。那末如何利用呢？我想很簡單。只要中央銀行在那上面，像郵票那樣，加印一個「改作五萬元」，就可發行出來。美國印的鈔票，自然印刷精美，紙張優良，比起中央印製廠印的那批萬元鈔來，一定漂亮得多。則老百姓歡迎惟恐不及，自然不會有什麼話說了。</p>
<p>如此一來，這一批外國貨的五元券就不會成為損失。旣可盡廢物之利，又可解現鈔之荒，豈不一舉兩得？</p>

<h3>誠實的酬報</h3>
<p>— 陳堯光</p>
<p>兩位女郎之一，在公共汽車快到站時，忽然想起自己尙未購票，便想再走入車廂去購票</p>
<p>另一位勸她不必，對她說：「你不購票而下了車，又怎樣呢」？</p>
<p>『我以為做人總須誠實呀」！她說，接着就去補票了</p>
<p>一會兒，她自車廂內走出，笑嘻嘻地對她的朋友說：「你看，我的誠實不是得到報應了嗎？我給他一張一元鈔票，他竟補找了我一張五元的呢」！</p>

<p>民國卅年春，先生與余相遇於第三戰區長官部之賓舍，時先生與柳詒徵丈，俱為顧墨三公之上賓。斯時先生適由衡陽來，望之似四十許人，眞樸誠摯，待人和藹，除為顧氏講解莊子外，復日與詒徵丈縱論古今，聽者動容。浙贛戰起，與詒徵丈同遷居福建建陽之馬伏，距余寓不及百步，每當夕陽西下之際，輒與詒徵丈，楊天道兄及余等徜徉水濱，以抒一日積悃。未幾，日寇退出玉山，先生因有廣西之遊，乃別吾等而去，今不見已八九年矣。此次由平來京，為國家謀和平，為人民求福利，消除和談之困難，其功豈亞於向日哉！</p>
<h3>就醫記</h3>
<p>— 白楚</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>我的朋友染上了肺病。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>他是看到痰裏有血絲，想起了最近下午的升火發熱，才感覺有肺病的嫌疑。</p>
<p>肺病是可怕的，尤其生在一個有家室之累的薪水階級身上。他不能不忍痛把一筆本來要買米的錢，去請敎醫生，求一個診斷。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>第一個醫生門診是一萬，在照過X光之後，下了結論：「你的肺上有幾粒黑點。」他認為不得要領。</p>
<p>第二個醫生門診要四萬，在照過X光之後，也下了結論：「你的肺上滿是黑點。」</p>
<p>第三個醫生是留德博士，肺病專家。門診要銀圓二圓，規定金圓券不收。在照過X光之後，醫生很嚴肅地表示：</p>
<p>『你的左肺有毛病。」</p>
<p>「是有些地方有黑點吧？」</p>
<p>「不，恐怕已經在腐蝕。」</p>
<p>天哪！他倒抽一口冷氣。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>肺病是千眞萬確的了，雖然三個醫生判斷的程度不同。</p>
<p>但也有一點是不謀而合的；他們都呌他趕快住醫院，打肺病特效藥，經常的來檢查。</p>
<p>醫院？窮公敎人員如何住得起醫院？</p>
<p>我那位朋友咬緊牙關，預備硬挺。</p>
<p>然而，他的家裏人慌起來，他的朋友也慌起來。這東西是要人性命的喲！怎麼能「挺」？</p>
<p>經過好多人的遊說勸解，他懂得了「留得靑山在，不怕沒柴燒一的古諺，答允進醫院。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>於是：他的錶卸了下來，妻子陪嫁來的金耳環，金手釧也拿了出來。</p>
<p>捧了六十多萬的現鈔，他踏上一家別人介紹認為最平民化的醫院。</p>
<p>在說明了來意之後，醫院裏人遞給他一張價目表，用冷峻的眼光巡視着。眞的，他穿得太破舊了。</p>
<p>我那位朋友盯住價目單。自然，頭等與他無緣，可以略過。</p>
<p>二等呢？住一天五萬，連吃帶打針要十萬。住不起！</p>
<p>三等註明十六人一間，住一天總共要六萬，他也不願意。</p>
<p>然而，然而又沒有四等。他盤算良久，才決定下來，慢慢踱到掛號的窗口。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>他掛了號，捧出那堆剛才用東西換來的現鈔。</p>
<p>裏面算珠一陣嚮，拋出了一句話：</p>
<p>「先付一百四十萬。」</p>
<p>「什麼！要這麼多？」我的朋友吃驚起來。</p>
<p>也許裏面那位先生，早已習慣於這樣的問句，他不慌不忙，帶有諷刺似的報起賬來：</p>
<p>「保證金八十萬，預付十天費用六十萬，一共一百四十萬。」</p>
<p>「保證金？為什麼要保證金？」</p>
<p>「這是醫院裏的規矩，那一個醫院都是這樣。沒有保證金，將來住院付不出賬找誰去算。」</p>
<p>「那末我找個舖保吧！」</p>
<p>「請你不要開玩笑，我們祗收保證金，不要什麼舖保廠保。」</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>我的朋友無法進醫院。</p>
<p>他把那筆現鈔放了幾天拆息，買進大頭，買進賣出，現在倒搞得不錯，每天穩可以撈上幾萬塊錢。</p>
<p>最近看見他，却是紅光滿面，不知道還是第X期肺病的定期生火呢？還是因為發財而喜氣揚揚？</p>
<p>但有一點可以注意的是：他家裏人不再為他的病着急了。</p>
<p>也許他的病已好了。</p>

<h3>Initial Conclusions Reached on Principles Discussion; Eight Conditions Modified; Yu Youren to Represent Government and Go to Beiping Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The formal peace talks conference has not yet begun on the 12th, but the exchange of conditions prior to the meeting and the discussion of principles based on the eight conditions of the Chinese Communists have yielded preliminary conclusions. Pre-meeting consultations have come to an end as of the 12th. According to what this reporter has learned from related sources, the Chinese Communists have made considerable revisions to their attitude towards the eight conditions. Furthermore, the government delegation's report on the preliminary consultations will be sent to Nanjing shortly, and an agreement can be decided upon for signing once the government has studied and agreed to it.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Yu Youren, a high-ranking official appointed by the government to go to Beiping, is scheduled to fly to Beiping on the 14th. Accompanying him will be members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans to represent the opinions of the public. The legislators are Qiu Changwei and two others, and the supervisor is Gu Fengxiang. As for the high-ranking officials Zhang Qun and Wu Zhongxin, originally scheduled to be invited to Beiping by the government, they have declined to go. It is widely believed that Yu Youren is welcomed by the Chinese Communist side, and his presence will be of considerable assistance to the unfolding of the peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Acting President Li hosted a banquet at the Presidential Palace at 7:00 PM on the 12th for the military and political leaders who had arrived in Nanjing, including Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, Ma Hongkui, Bai Chongxi, Qin Dechun, He Yingqin, Chief of Staff Liu, and over a dozen others. After the banquet, they exchanged opinions extensively on the current situation. At the time, a major fire broke out at the United Logistics Headquarters gas station a few hundred meters east of the Presidential Palace. Acting President Li and the dignitaries remained at the Presidential Palace, calmly conversing, and only left leisurely around 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Acting President Li convened a meeting of important officials at the Gongqiu at 9:00 PM on the 12th. He Yingqin, Yu Youren, Yan Xishan, Bai Chongxi, Wu Tiecheng, and others were present.

<h3>Zhu Yunshan, Fu Xuewen, and Liu Zhongrong Fly to Beiping on a CNAC Special Plane; Arrive at Xiyuan Airport in the Dim Evening Light</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] According to a Beiping telegram received here on the evening of the 12th: The CNAC special plane XT515, carrying Zhu Yunshan, Fu Xuewen, and others to Beiping, safely landed at Xiyuan Airport at 6:55 PM in the dim evening light.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Zhu Yunshan, a representative of Li Jishen, one of the three "mystery guests" from Beiping carrying the third-party mission to convey opinions on the peace talks to Nanjing, flew from Nanjing to Beiping on a CNAC special plane at 2:50 PM on the 12th. He was accompanied on this trip by Mr. Liu Zhongrong. Also traveling with them were Ms. Fu Xuewen, wife of Shao Lizi, and Zhu Yunshan's son, for a total of four people. Their luggage was also very simple. The special plane was a CNAC XT515 C47-type aircraft, which was assigned by the Presidential Office at 11:00 AM on the 12th after notifying CNAC. The plane had arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 1:10 PM on the 12th, carrying banknotes for the National Bank. After landing at Ming Palace Airport at 2:20 PM and unloading the cargo, it hurriedly refueled in preparation for the flight north. Very few people knew about Zhu's trip beforehand. They were only notified to rush to the airport to board the plane when the preparations for the special plane were completed. At 2:45 PM, Zhu, Liu, and Fu arrived by car. Acting President Li's representative Li Yuqing, Legislative Yuan members Wei Yongcheng, Qiu Changwei, Cheng Siyuan, and others were all present to see them off. Yu Youren was also present to see Fu Xuewen off. Zhu Yunshan was wearing a black Zhongshan suit, holding a black leather overcoat with a leather collar. He had a black mustache and looked quite old. His mysterious aura seemed to remain as he left Nanjing. After Zhu got out of the car, he was ushered into the airport by Shao, Cheng, and others. Liu Zhongrong, wearing a navy blue suit and a grass-green short jacket, boarded the plane first. After Shao's wife, Fu Xuewen, got out of the car, she exchanged pleasantries with this reporter. This reporter presented her with copies of the 12th editions of this newspaper and the News Daily. Mrs. Shao said, "Please write well about this. Mr. Shao asked me to go. I'm not sure when I'll be back." When the reporter asked if this trip was at the invitation of the government, Mrs. Shao repeatedly said, "No! No!" She then hurriedly boarded the special plane, which took off immediately.</p>

<h3>Government to Establish Management Committee for North-South Navigation and Material Exchange; Measures to be Announced After Approval by the Executive Yuan; Executive Yuan to Discuss Proposed Postal, Telecommunications, and Railway Price Increases Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The Executive Yuan will submit the plans for North-South navigation and material exchange for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 13th. It will be announced and implemented as soon as it is approved. The plan has already been reviewed by Deputy Premier Jia, relevant heads of departments and commissions, and people in the navigation industry. The government will establish a management committee to guide navigation and material exchange affairs, and be responsible for management. Regarding the scope of material exchange, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has already drafted a list of materials that can be transported from the government area to the Communist area, including Taiwan sugar, gauze, grain, caustic soda, industrial raw materials, and machine parts. It is hoped to exchange for coal, soybeans, furs, pigs, etc. from the Communist area. In principle, goods will be exchanged for goods, with the types determined by the government and the quantities handled by the two parties themselves. Merchants must submit their applications to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review before departure, and ships must be reviewed by the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The Executive Yuan will discuss the postal, telecommunications, and railway price increases at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 13th. The price increase method proposed by the Ministry of Transportation is to increase postal, telecommunications, and railway prices by ten times, effective from the 16th of this month. The past Legislative Yuan passed a method for adjusting postal, telecommunications, and railway rates, stipulating that postal, telecommunications, and railway freight rates be adjusted once a month. The Ministry of Transportation believes that current price fluctuations are severe, and the price difference between the beginning and end of the month is significant. It decided to submit a proposal to the Executive Yuan on the 13th to change the adjustment to twice a month, and consult the Legislative Yuan to amend the original method. Minister of Transportation Duanmu Jie recently hosted all members of the Transportation Committee of the Legislative Yuan to explain that the transportation business cannot be maintained without price increases, which has been understood by the committee members. The Legislative Yuan has included the postal, telecommunications, and railway price increase proposal on the agenda for the Yuan meeting on the 15th.</p>

<h3>Communist Army in Jiangbei Continues Attacks; Fierce Assaults on Anqing Still Repelled by National Army; Garrison on Taiyang Island Northwest of Hugang Withdraws</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Although the CCP Central Committee has formally ordered a cessation of military offensives, as of noon on the 12th, several bridgeheads on the Jiangbei front were still under continuous attack by Communist artillery. Among them, the battles were fiercest in Anqing Yuxikou (across the river from Wuhu) and Taiyang Island in the Jiang River northwest of Huogang Town. On the Anqing front, starting on the night of the 11th, a division of the Communist army under Chen Geng continued to fiercely assault the agricultural school and Qipan Mountain northeast of the city. After being repelled before dawn on the 12th, they resumed shelling the National Army positions continuously from 9:00 AM. After the National Army launched a joint counterattack from the land, sea, and air, the fighting gradually subsided by noon. On the Yuxikou front, starting last night, two divisions of the Communist army under Chen Yi's 30th Army also launched a fierce assault, and were also repelled by noon on the 12th. On the Taiyang Island front, the 24th Army of Chen Yi's division, about one division strong, under the cover of artillery fire, forcibly crossed the river to Taiyang Island in the Jiang River from Liujia Ferry on the north bank at midnight on the 11th. A battalion of the National Army defending the island, due to the disparity in strength, actively withdrew by noon on the 12th after a fierce battle to strengthen the defenses on the south bank. Jiangpu City and Xiliang Mountain (across the river from Dangtu) were also attacked by the Communist army last night and this morning, and were all repelled by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] According to a certain military observer: The reason why several bridgeheads on the Jiangbei front are still being attacked by the Communist army on the 12th is that the Communist army is attempting to capture as many of the more important National Army bridgehead positions north of the river as possible before receiving the order to cease offensives, so that they can launch a large-scale crossing of the river once the peace talks break down. Therefore, apart from the bridgeheads east of Huazikou (across the river from Qixia Mountain) to Bawu across the river from Jiangyin, where the Communist army has retreated slightly and the fighting has subsided, the fighting on the line from Jiangpu west to Anqing continues. Therefore, the widespread rumor that the Communist army in Jiangbei is retreating is obviously premature, and whether the Communist army is sincere in stopping military offensives should be clear by the evening of the 13th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The National Army positions on the mountains about four or five li north of Pukou West Jiangpu City were attacked again by more than a thousand troops of Wu Huawen's Communist army last night. They were repelled by Liu Bingfang's troops of the National Army at around 4:00 AM on the 12th. In addition, at Huazikou on the opposite bank of Qixia Mountain, the National Army repelled more than 500 attacking Communist troops last night, killing more than 50 Communist troops and capturing three.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 12th] There is no change in the situation facing Zhenjiang today. According to a military source: The main force of the Communist army on the Yangliu line has indeed retreated, and the main force has gone to Yangzhou, but the National Army on the Liuwu front has not advanced forward. This morning, they are still firmly defending the old Siwu, Zhu Jiaqigan, Chen Jiaqiao area. The Guazhou Shierwu line is also quiet. It is also learned that, except for Guazhou, Liuwu, Shierwu, Puzhen, Yuxikou, and Hexian, the rest of the National Army's bridgeheads along the river north of the river have fallen into the hands of the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 12th] Lin Biao's 43rd Army entered Huang'an County City from south of Hekou on the 11th, with a part of the remaining troops occupying Changxuanling.</p>
<p>[Our Huangpi Dispatch, 12th] According to transportation industry personnel who came here from Xinyang on the 12th: It is a fact that among the 40th and 43rd armies of Lin Biao's troops heading south, there are Japanese prisoners of war and Korean Communists. The military uniforms they wear are the same as the Communist army, and their number accounts for about 10%.</p>
<h3>Gui Yongqing Inspects River Defenses; Visited Zhenjiang Yesterday and Returned to Nanjing That Evening</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 12th] Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, accompanied by Director Tao Diya of the Political Warfare Department and more than ten others, arrived in Zhenjiang by car from Nanjing at 9:00 AM on the 12th. After a short rest at the Second Fleet Headquarters, at 2:00 PM, accompanied by Deputy Commander Yang of the Provincial Security Force, Commander Lin of the First Fleet, Chief of Staff Mai, and others, he took a gunboat to inspect the forts in the Jiaoshan Ganlu Temple area. He returned to Zhenjiang at about 4:00 PM and summoned the persons in charge of the various fleets stationed in Zhenjiang, giving detailed instructions on the current naval defense. Gui returned to Nanjing that evening.</p>
<h3>People of Anqing are Peaceful and Quiet; Our Reporter Visits the City</h3>
<p>[Our Anqing Dispatch, 12th] After a three-day journey, our reporter arrived in Anqing from Jiujiang and entered Anqing, the famous city that had been fiercely fought for 21 days, at 6:00 PM on the 12th. That evening, he was introduced to Commander Wu Zhongjian, the defending general, by Colonel Bao Shiqi. The city of Anqing is orderly and the people are peaceful and quiet. Since the start of the Anqing defense battle, this newspaper is the first to send a reporter to the city for interviews.</p>
<h3>National Army Has Long Ceased Offensives; No Need to Issue Ceasefire Order</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Local evening newspapers reported that the government had formally signed and issued a ceasefire order by the Ministry of National Defense at 3:00 PM on the 11th. After this reporter investigated with relevant parties, they all said "they had not heard of it." Military command units at all levels have also not yet received this order. Furthermore, according to a senior official in charge of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, since the President officially advocated peace in his New Year's Day address, the National Army has not launched any attacks on the Communist army. Therefore, this ceasefire order is actually unnecessary for the National Army.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Holds Secret Meeting; Liu Gongyun Reports on Finance; Imbalance of Revenue and Expenditure; Issuing Banknotes Was Truly a Last Resort; Committee Members Mainly Propose Increasing Revenue and Oppose Selling Off</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The Legislative Yuan held a plenary session on the morning of the 12th, and Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun was invited to attend and answer inquiries. During the meeting, a majority of 107 votes to 106 votes passed a motion to hold a secret meeting, where Liu Gongyun answered the inquiries raised by Legislative Yuan members Liu Shidu and 42 others. It was stated that: (1) The issuance of large banknotes was to meet needs. The fundamental problem at present is the imbalance between revenue and expenditure. The government is trying to increase tax revenue, and has proposed methods such as tax dollars and customs dollars in the amended financial and monetary reform plan. It is hoped that the Legislative Yuan will pass and implement them as soon as possible. (2) The relocation of gold, silver, and foreign exchange to Taiwan, South China, and other places is for safety considerations and was done under orders. They can be transported back at any time. The purpose of selling off gold is to contract the currency in circulation and suppress prices. Moreover, it is sold at market prices, so buyers have no profit to be made. (3) The issuance policy is a last resort. In fact, the fact that finance can be maintained to this day is due to currency issuance. The government will still do its best to improve the treatment of military personnel, civil servants, and educators, as well as contract the currency in circulation and stabilize prices. (4) The government has always maintained cultural undertakings, so it provided loans of 60 million yuan to each newspaper in Nanjing. I have no prejudice against this. When the meeting continued in the afternoon, various committee members raised questions, all opposing the contraction of currency in circulation by selling off gold and silver, advocating for increasing tax revenue to replace the issuance policy, and showing the courage to reform the monetary system. Those who did not have time to speak submitted written questions, which Liu Gongyun answered in writing. The secret meeting then ended.</p>
<h3>Hankou Raises Contingency Funds; 600,000 Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 11th] The Hankou Municipal Government has decided to raise 600,000 silver dollars in contingency funds to prepare for unforeseen needs. It is estimated that each employee can receive 12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hu Zongnan Goes from Nanjing to Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Director Hu Zongnan went to Suzhou by car on the morning of the 12th to visit his wife, and will return to Nanjing in two or three days.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Based Supervisors Go to Nanjing; To Attend Important Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Supervisory Yuan Office received a call from the Nanjing Supervisory Yuan yesterday, stating that with President Yu's trip north imminent, the Yuan is scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting on the afternoon of the 13th. More than 20 supervisors in Shanghai, including Vice President Liu Zhe, took a train to Nanjing last night to reconvene. Furthermore, the 27 supervisors in Shanghai held a discussion meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, unanimously urging Vice President Liu to stay in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>President Chiang Sweeps Tomb</h3>
<p>[Our Yin County Dispatch, 12th] Yesterday afternoon, President Chiang, accompanied by his eldest son, Jingguo, grandsons Xiaowen and Xiaowu, and others, took three cars to the mountains to pay respects at the tomb of his great-great-grandfather, Ling Minggong, the Grand Master of the Golden Purple. He also visited the Chiang family ancestral hall. The President also agreed to repair it on their behalf. He then accepted tea offered by the brides and took commemorative photos before returning. Furthermore, President Chiang personally inscribed the plaque "A Prosperous Business in Famous Mountains" for the Tianyi Pavilion Library to commemorate it.</p>
<h3>Yu Dawei Recuperating in Shanghai; To Undergo Surgery Soon; Extremely Concerned About Transportation Situation in Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mr. Yu Dawei arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan the day before yesterday. According to him: Since going to Taiwan on February 7th, he has been out of touch with the outside world for a long time due to the need for rest due to illness, so he understands little about the evolution of current affairs. When the reporter asked for his views on the peace talks, Mr. Yu humbly said: The work he has undertaken in the past has been technical, and the peace talks are rich in political significance, making it difficult to judge. Mr. Yu expressed great concern about the traffic conditions on the Nanjing-Shanghai route, and believes that whether the shelling along the coast north of the Yangtze River can cut off traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai line depends on the general situation. According to Mr. Yu himself: He will undergo surgery again soon, so he needs a considerable period of recuperation and cannot take on any duties.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Arrest of Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian: Heated Debate in the Legislative Yuan, Committee Members Speak Out Demanding Concrete Protection of Human Rights, Resulting in the Passage of a Resolution Requiring the Executive Yuan to Punish According to Law</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The arrest of Legislative Yuan members Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian caused a great uproar during the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 12th. Committee members expressed indignation at the illegal arrest of legislators by military authorities. The measures taken by President He [Yingqin] apparently gained the approval of the legislators; however, most legislators still demanded that the person primarily responsible, Tang Enbo, commander of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, be identified and that the Executive Yuan be requested to punish him. After much debate, a resolution was finally passed. The case was brought up in the morning by President Tong [Guanxian] in the form of a temporary report, in which he immediately explained that committee members Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian were arrested the day before by the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters and that the Legislative Yuan had negotiated with Executive Yuan President He [Yingqin] for their release. He also said that Committee Member Jin [Shaoxian] had been released at 11:00 p.m. that night, and Committee Member Xu [Wentian] arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 12th, where he was picked up by Secretary-General Chen [Kewen] and returned to his residence to rest, and was scheduled to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting in the afternoon to report. Regarding this matter, President He [Yingqin] had sent a letter explaining the handling of the situation. The original letter was read out immediately (see separate article). Subsequently, Jin Shaoxian, at the request of the committee members, reported on his arrest (the content was the same as that published in this newspaper on the 12th). Jin [Shaoxian] said: "The handling of this incident shows that the Executive Yuan still has power, which is very gratifying." Zhang Jiuru then spoke, saying that although the Executive Yuan's handling was good, it should not only pay attention to the central government in the future, but also to arrest incidents at the local level. Shao Jingren said: "The arrest of legislators this time is an unconstitutional act. He advocated a serious inquiry to pursue responsibility and severely punish those responsible to safeguard the constitution." The chairman announced: "Can this case be discussed again after Committee Member Xu [Wentian] reports in the afternoon?" There was no objection. After the closed-door meeting in the afternoon, the Legislative Yuan meeting was reconvened, and Xu Wentian was immediately invited to report on his arrest (see separate article). Subsequently, committee members spoke one after another, criticizing the illegality of this act. Xiao Juetian said: "The Legislative Yuan cannot protect the basic freedoms of the people, and even its own basic freedoms cannot be protected," which was heartbreaking. Niu Jianchu said that the Communist Party created a red terror, and the government must not create a white terror. He advocated that in addition to their own safety, they should also pay attention to protecting human rights. Zou Shuwen said that there were too many arrest agencies everywhere, and hoped that they could be simplified. Wu Hexuan said that this was a serious constitutional issue, and the government should be asked whether it wanted a constitution. Regarding the handling of this case, the committee members unanimously advocated consulting the Executive Yuan on the following: (1) Investigate the responsibility and find out who issued the order; (2) The organizers are so absurd that they should be investigated and severely punished within a week; (3) Issue a circular to military and police agencies that, except for criminals caught in the act, they must not arrest legislators without authorization; (4) Human rights should be effectively protected in the future, but there were differing opinions on whether the person primarily responsible should be identified. After Wu Hexuan declared that he was a friend of Tang Enbo, he said that Tang Enbo should bear full responsibility and be punished. Huang Yuren also said: "President He's letter has proved that Tang [Enbo] should be responsible." Yang Gongda advocated that Tang Enbo should be punished after the investigation. A chorus of boos immediately arose from the audience, and the meeting became chaotic as a result. Shao Jingren said: "The responsibility should be borne by Tang [Enbo], but the Legislative Yuan is not a judicial body and cannot designate who is responsible. The Executive Yuan can be consulted to investigate this person in highest authority and severely punish him." Huang Yuren still expressed his opposition, and after a long dispute, Chen Guda finally proposed a revised opinion, which was: "According to President He's letter, Tang Enbo has already requested punishment. In order to maintain the dignity of the Constitution, the Executive Yuan should punish him according to law." This was finally passed. In addition, the committee members' opinions, including the effective protection of human rights, the severe punishment of those responsible within a week, the investigation and thorough disbandment of all secret service organizations by the Executive Yuan, and the request that the Executive Yuan order the organizers to report and submit evidence of Committee Member Xu's incitement to rebellion, so that Committee Member Xu could respond and the truth could be ascertained before the General Assembly made a decision, were all submitted to the Executive Yuan for handling.</p>
<p>Xu Wentian Returned to Nanjing Yesterday Morning: No Mistreatment or Torture in Shanghai, Said He Did Not Want to Expand on This Misunderstanding</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Legislative Yuan member Xu Wentian, who was arrested in Nanjing, was released in Shanghai on the evening of the 11th and took the night train to Nanjing on the morning of the 12th. Chen Zuming, the senior staff officer in charge of the case, came with him. After getting off the train, they went to the Executive Yuan together. Because Xu's release from the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters was handled according to the order of Executive Yuan President He Yingqin, he handed Xu over to Huang Shaogu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. Xu told Huang [Shaogu] about the process of being arrested and released, and then returned to his residence to rest. In the afternoon, he attended the Legislative Yuan to report on his arrest. When reporters visited him, he said: "I don't want to expand on this misunderstanding. There was no mistreatment or torture from the time I was arrested to the time I was released." According to what he knew, after being arrested on the 10th, two people were taken from the Weishu Headquarters to the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters at the same time, one surnamed Fang, who is still being held in Shanghai, and one surnamed Jia, who swallowed gold after being arrested and was sent to the hospital for treatment after being discovered. Both of them are employees of the Farmers and Workers News Agency. When reporters asked whether Commander Tang Enbo's report to President He [Yingqin] that "recent evidence has been obtained that Committee Member Xu [Wentian] is suspected of inciting a major military rebellion" was related, Xu [Wentian] replied: "This matter happened a long time ago and has nothing to do with me. I used to be the Director of Education of the Jiangsu Provincial Training Corps, so I have many friends in the organization. The rebellion referred to may be the Jiangsu Provincial Security Second Brigade Commander in Zhenjiang and Tao Hongzhao and Suzhou Water Police Bureau Chief Zhang Shaohua, but Tao [Hongzhao] and Zhang [Shaohua] have been arrested." Xu [Wentian] admitted that if he were not a legislator, he might not have been released so smoothly. According to reports, Xu's release was the result of the Legislative Yuan's protest to the Executive Yuan that the arrest was illegal, but the Xu case has not been concluded, and Xu did not deny this point when talking to reporters.</p>
<p>Report in the Legislative Yuan on the Arrest and Release</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Legislative Yuan member Xu Wentian reported to the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 12th about his arrest and release, saying: "After being arrested at the Wenfeng Bookstore at about 2:00 p.m. on the 10th, I was taken to the Guard Group of the Weishu Headquarters. At 4:00 p.m., I was sent to the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters in Xiaolingwei. At 10:00 p.m., I was taken by car to Zhenjiang Station and transferred to a train. On the morning of the 11th, I arrived in Shanghai, first sent to the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, and then sent to another place by the police department. Until the evening, I was sent back to the station and took the military train back to Nanjing." Xu [Wentian] said: "This arrest was a misunderstanding, because they have an organization called the 'Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance', which was established last spring. The main purpose is to seek the re-development of the Three People's Principles. The members are all members of the Kuomintang, and it has developed very rapidly in recent years, which has attracted much attention. All parties do not fully understand this organization. Recently, many members of the alliance in various places have been arrested. I am also a member of the alliance, so it may have caused a misunderstanding." Xu [Wentian] then stated that when he was interrogated in Shanghai, he wrote a statement together with them. The statement had pre-existing topics, many of which he did not understand. He could only ask for their opinions and write according to them, and he could not admit this statement. Xu [Wentian] also said: "From the day before yesterday to this morning, I saw many civilians and soldiers being arrested. I believe that ordinary people who commit crimes should be tried by judicial organs and do not want to be detained by military organs. I hope that the Legislative Yuan will correct this point. As for me personally, I hope that the Legislative Yuan will not cause waves because of this matter. The current environment is difficult and peace talks are underway. I don't want to cause waves because of personal issues and affect the peace talks."</p>
<p>President He Ordered an Investigation of Responsibility: Commander Tang Requested Punishment</p>
<p>He's Letter to Tong Guanxian</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The full text of the letter from Executive Yuan President He Yingqin to Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian is as follows: "President Tong Guanxian, Today (11th), Secretary-General Chen Kewen of your esteemed Yuan visited and learned that Committee Members Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian of your esteemed Yuan were suddenly arrested by military organs yesterday. Committee Member Jin [Shaoxian] has been released, and Committee Member Xu [Wentian] has been sent to Shanghai. I was very surprised by this, because this kind of behavior is illegal. I immediately telegraphed Tang Enbo, Commander of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, who said: 'Recent evidence has been obtained that Committee Member Xu [Wentian] is suspected of inciting a major military rebellion, and I ordered Wan Jianfan, Deputy Commander of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, to investigate and handle the matter. Unexpectedly, Chen Zuming, the staff officer in charge of the case in Nanjing, did not understand the provisions of the Constitution and arrested him without authorization without reporting to Deputy Commander Wan [Jianfan], which was very inappropriate. Although I am responsible for the oversight, I should submit a request for punishment.' When I inquired about Deputy Commander Wan, he said: 'Staff Officer Chen Zuming did not ask him for instructions.' Yingqin immediately telegraphed Commander Tang [Enbo] to immediately release Committee Member Xu [Wentian] and send someone to accompany him to Nanjing. He also detained Chen Zuming and sent him to Nanjing for punishment according to law. At the same time, he ordered the Ministry of National Defense to thoroughly investigate the matter, pursue responsibility, and issue a circular to military and police agencies to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. He also ordered the Ministry to submit a detailed report on the ins and outs of this case. I am forwarding this to you for your information, and please forward it to the committee members of your esteemed Yuan. I respectfully wish you good health, Your brother, He Yingqin, April 11." (More details about Xu's arrest will be published on page 2.)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to the Defense of Wuhan!</h3>
<p>Although there is a glimmer of hope for peace talks, the military situation on the northern bank of the Yangtze River is temporarily in a state of stalemate; however, the situation surrounding Wuhan is still outwardly relaxed but inwardly tense, and future developments are worth noting. According to the current situation in Wuhan, after the troops commanded by General Bai Chongxi withdrew from Zhumadian, Henan, all the way to Xiaogan, on the outskirts of Wuhan, the Communist army seemed to be gradually approaching the bridgeheads for crossing the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei, central Hubei, and western Hubei from the two wings of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, and Hankou has become a stronghold protruding from the northern bank of the Yangtze River. Now eastern and western Hubei are feeling increasingly heavy pressure from the Communist army. After the national army in Huangmei and Xishui in eastern Hubei retreated, the national army on the outskirts of Wuhan is currently strengthening the defenses in the Xiaogan and Huangpi areas. On the 10th, the northbound train on the Pinghan Railway only reached Hengdian, and the military crisis is imminent. The national army's transfer in this area is naturally not a defeat, but entirely for strategic reasons, in order to strengthen the defense of the outskirts of Wuhan. Judging from the attitude and determination of the national army, Wuhan can be defended. Despite the increasingly tight surrounding situation, General Bai Chongxi is confident and will be able to defend Greater Wuhan at all costs.</p>
<p>Wuhan is the abdomen of the Yangtze River, the central stream, and its situation is important; taking Wuhan's location as an example, if we draw a circle with a radius of 1,000 miles, Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin), Nanjing-Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Xi'an, and Taiyuan are all within the scope, which is enough to show that Wuhan occupies a central position in China's geography. Wuhan, that is, the general name of the three towns of Hankou, Hanyang, and Wuchang, in terms of its strategic location, is surrounded by the Yangtze River and the Han River, connecting north and south. In the past, it was called the thoroughfare of nine provinces, the key to north-south transportation. To the northwest, the Han River can reach Shaanxi and Gansu, and to the east and west, the Yangtze River can reach Yunnan, Sichuan, Jiangsu, and Anhui; in addition, the Pinghan Railway extends north to Beiping and Hebei and Henan provinces, and the Yuehan Railway extends south to Guangzhou, which can connect eastern Guangdong and is the center of transportation throughout the country. The Book of Songs says "滔滔江漢" (surging Yangtze and Han), "如江如漢" (like the Yangtze and Han), "江漢浮浮" (floating Yangtze and Han), "江漢湯湯" (abundant Yangtze and Han), which is not a song praising the water of the Yangtze and Han rivers, but actually praising the situation of Wuhan, which has an abundant and surging momentum, and its every movement and float is enough to connect the north and south. Because of the importance of Wuhan's situation, in any military conflict in Chinese history, the gain or loss of this place has been the key to success or failure for those using troops in the north and south. The ancients said: "The Chu of the Spring and Autumn Period was a frequent contention for military strategists." The history of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods can be said to be the history of the disputes in the Chu area, which is enough to show that the contest for the strategic location of Chu by the north and south is greatly related to a turning point in history. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the uprising of the Xinhai Revolution was the first, and the whole country responded to it. In less than a year, the country was restored and the republic was created. Although the demise of the Qing Dynasty also had its reasons, only by occupying the ground and gaining momentum could it be so effective so quickly, which was definitely not accidental. This not only illustrates the importance of Wuhan's situation, but also the importance of Wuhan's defense.</p>
<p>To defend Wuhan, it is necessary to consolidate its periphery first; otherwise, it will not be easy to maintain peace for a long time. The Battle of Wuhan in the War of Resistance Against Japan did not take place in the core, but in the outer perimeter. The so-called Wuhan periphery has a very wide range, with Wuxue and Xinshan in the east, as well as Jiujiang and Hukou, and even further to Pengze and Madang; to the north along the Pinghan Railway, there are the dangers of the Tongbai Mountains and Jigong Mountain, and the importance of the Yiyang Three Passes; to the northwest along the Han River, there is the solidity of Xiangfan, which has always been the lock of the north and south. To the west is the land of Jingzhou, where Jiangling is located, controlling the key routes of Ba and Kui, connecting the upper reaches of Wuhan, embracing Xiangfan to the north, connecting Changde and Yuanling to the south, bordering the Yangtze and Han rivers, and arching the arms of Wu and Chu. As Zhuge Wuhou said, it is a country where military force is used, and as Gu Zuyu said, it is an important town in Huguang. Wuhan is not only the throat of the two lakes, but also the throat of the Yangtze River. Today, the Communist army is eyeing Wuhan, intending to approach this throat to facilitate the control of central China, threaten Nanjing and Shanghai, shake southern China, and cut off the connection between Sichuan and Kang to the outside world. Therefore, the gain or loss of Wuhan is too important and worthy of close attention from the government and the public.</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation of the national and communist armies, the national army must defend Wuhan, and the communist army must strive to seize Wuhan. Therefore, the struggle for the periphery of Wuhan is difficult to avoid a fierce battle. We cannot make premature predictions about the future evolution of Wuhan, but we can point out that the gain or loss of Wuhan is greatly related to the progress of the peace talks, and it is greatly related to the superior and inferior situation of the national and communist armies. Therefore, today's Wuhan and its defense are worthy of our deep attention and concern.</p>
<h3>New Disturbances Brewing in Western Hunan: Fifteen or Sixteen People Want to Be Military Commanders, Pacification Is Difficult, Yang Guangyao and Zhou Qing's Troops Stirring, Yuanling Becomes Tense Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 12th] It is widely rumored here that another change is brewing in western Hunan, with many "heroes" supporting Chen Quzhen, the old "King of Western Hunan" who has been in seclusion for a long time, as their leader, and using Li Jishen's "Kuomintang Reform Committee" as a front. Among them, Yang Guangyao, who is indeed in contact with the Reform Committee, has gathered nearly 10,000 people and is advancing towards Yuanling, and Yuanling, whose wounds have not yet healed, is trembling again.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 12th] Song Xilian is finding the work of pacifying the civilian armed forces in western Hunan quite difficult. It is said that there are too many people in western Hunan who want to be promoted, and there are as many as fifteen or sixteen people who want to obtain the position of military commander. Recently, various "heroes" led by Zhou Xieqing have gathered thousands of people and guns between Fenghuang and Qiancheng, and are planning to launch another attack in western Hunan. Zhou [Xieqing] contacted Wang Yuanhua and Cao Zhenya of Yongshun in advance, and held a meeting in Majia'ao, Qiancheng, at the beginning of this month. Participants included Wu Hengliang of Yongshui, Huang Daxun of Baojing, Xu Hanzhang of Luxi, Pan Zhuangfei of Qianyang, Long Feitian of Mayang, and Zhang Dazhi of Gucheng. Zhang Yulin of Chenxi, who had already been incorporated, also sent a representative to participate. Their intention is to advance on Changde and Taojiang in two routes, one via Yongshun and Dayong, and the other via Yuanling. Xiong Zilin's troops under Zhou [Xieqing] have advanced to the border of Qiancheng, and Yuanling has entered a state of tension again. According to reports, Zhou [Xieqing] is from Xiushan, Sichuan. More than a decade ago, he entered Hunan with a gun and was incorporated by Chen Quzhen, serving as a brigade commander in Chen's troops. In the 29th year of the Republic [1940], Gu Zhutong revoked his number due to the discipline of Zhou's troops and detained Zhou, who was later acquitted and released. He then resided in Nanjing and Shanghai, and only recently returned from Shanghai. He happened to be in Yuanling when it fell last time.</p>
<h3>The Rebellious Traffic Police Chief, Zhang Xianzheng, Captured and Escorted to Changsha, the Rebellious Situation Is Subtle, the Pacification Commissioner's Office Is Investigating</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 12th] Zhang Xianzheng, the chief of the First Teaching Corps of the Traffic Police, rebelled. Zhang [Xianzheng] has been captured in a rural area near Shaoyang and has been sent to the province. However, the content of Zhang's rebellion is very subtle. Zhang's defense is that it was not a rebellion, but a misunderstanding. The Pacification Commissioner's Office is now investigating the officers and soldiers detained in Zhuzhou and sent to Changsha in detail to verify the facts. In addition, the Ministry of National Defense telegraphed the Pacification Commissioner's Office yesterday, saying: "According to the report from the Traffic Police Headquarters, Zhang Xianzheng, chief of the First Teaching Corps of the Traffic Police, plundered guns and led the police to rebel. Please handle the matter according to law." In addition, more than 1,700 officers and soldiers of the corps stationed in Chashi, Hengyang, have been reorganized into an independent security regiment by Liu Renkui, sent by the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and led by Liu [Renkui] to Changsha on the 12th to be stationed in Huanghuashi for reorganization. As for the officers and soldiers of the Second Corps, some will be sent to Zhejiang, and the rest will be incorporated into the national army.</p>

<h3>Two Battalions of Rebellious Army in Shijing, Guangdong, All Return to Guangzhou, Two Battalion Commanders Flee to Macau in Fear of Punishment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 12th] After the army, navy, and air force surrounded and persuaded the two battalions of Ge Xiancai's troops of the 196th Division of the national army that rebelled in Shijing, they have now all returned and arrived in Guangzhou on the 12th. However, the two battalion commanders of the rebellious army fled to Macau in fear of punishment. Commander Ge [Xiancai] also returned to Guangzhou from Jiangmen to report the pacification process to Yu Hanmou. According to a senior official of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, their rebellion was mainly due to the low pay and not due to political conspiracy. He pointed out that if there were political relations, they would have fled to northern Guangdong or eastern Jiangnan Road, and would never have fled to the bag-shaped area of Zhongshan Doumen, waiting for the national army to surround them. He also said that the soldiers of the two battalions that returned to Guangzhou did not lose a single gun or bullet.</p>

The code name has also been changed to "Justice." When reporters visited Mr. Xu [Sixian], he told them: "This incident has come to an end. We are now sending people to investigate the number of dead and wounded students and the number of guns lost, as well as the disturbances along the way. As for the students who have returned, they deeply regret being deceived this time. I have decided to follow the instructions of the Commander-in-Chief and treat them leniently without further investigation."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 12th] After the First Headquarters of the He National Defense Ministry Yu Gan was coerced to rebel by the former Commander Jia Yibin, a part of more than 700 people crossed the national army's defense line on the 10th and went to Mogan Mountain, intending to enter Tianmu Mountain.

<h3>Chen Bijun Has Many Troubles in Prison: There Is Also a Dispute Over US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 12th] It is rumored that the traitor Chen Bijun recently submitted a petition to the authorities of the Shizikou Prison, requesting them to force Chen Shibiao, the director of the traitorous Nantong Chamber of Commerce who had been released on bail, to compensate her for 1,000 US dollars that she had been defrauded of. It is said that this huge amount of US dollars was given to her by a certain important person during a visit because of her difficult situation. Later, a traitorous Chen [Shibiao] in the same cell deceived her into handing it over to him to find a way to do business and make profits. Unexpectedly, not long after, he claimed that it had all been lost, and he himself was released on bail, causing Chen Bijun to be very resentful and report it to the authorities. However, according to reporters' investigations, last year there was a rumor in prison that Chen Bijun had several hundred US dollars of her own to do business outside, which was lost. Chen [Bijun] vehemently denied it after hearing about it, and complained a lot in prison. Therefore, the current rumor of being defrauded of 1,000 US dollars may be far-fetched.</p>

<h3>4,500 Bales of U.S. Aid Cotton Yarn Allocated to Fund the Qiantang River Seawall Project; U.S. Aid Council Signs Contract with Economic Cooperation Administration</h3>
<p>[Joint Office Dispatch] The U.S. Aid Council and the Economic Cooperation Administration's special project funding method will change today. This method will allow the Qiantang River seawall project to continue without interruption.</p>
<p>In the future, this type of project can be directly supported by the funds from the sale of U.S. aid cotton cloth and cotton yarn in China.

Previously, all projects were funded by allocations from the special accounts of the U.S. Aid Council and the Economic Cooperation Administration.</p>
<p>The contract for changing the funding method for the seawall project was jointly signed by the U.S. Aid Council, the Economic Cooperation Administration, and the Capital Management Committee of both organizations, represented by Griffin, Acting Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Liaison Commissioner of the U.S. Aid Council, and Li Ming, Chairman of the Qiantang River Project Management Committee.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the agreement, the Economic Cooperation Administration and the U.S. Aid Council will allocate 4,500 bales of U.S. aid cotton yarn to the Qiantang River Project Management Committee's account. The value of this cotton yarn, US$900,000, is sufficient to complete the US$1.6 million Qiantang River seawall project. When the Qiantang River seawall project requires funds, the Management Committee can request the sale of the required amount of cotton yarn. The proceeds from the sale will be paid to the Central Bank and transferred to the Committee's account.

<h3>Suzhou County Bank Embezzlement Case; County Government Submits to the Provincial Finance Department for Handling</h3>

According to reporters, it was found that there were three tax payments with inconsistent registration dates, totaling more than 30,000 gold yuan. The county government has now reported this case to the provincial finance department for handling. Although the bank has made some justifications, the advantages of the new accounting system can prevent forgotten entries, so even if it is forgotten, it can be discovered on the same day.

<h3>Inside Story of the Arrest of Legislator Xu Wentian; Repeatedly Inciting Military Rebellion with Conclusive Evidence; Processing Personnel Unfamiliar with Legal Procedures Also Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Regarding the arrest of legislator Xu Wentian, in order to understand the truth of the case, the reporter visited the security agency yesterday and learned the inside story as follows: Xu belongs to the so-called "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance" (please refer to page 5 today), and once served as the military minister of the alliance. He is currently the "General Commander of the National Self-Defense Army of Jiangsu and Anhui," and also acts as the organization minister of the alliance. In fact, this organization is an external group of the Communist Party. Xu began his activities in Chongqing as early as the summer of 1945. He successively participated in the Kuomintang Revolutionary New Faction, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Social Party, and the Three Principles of the People Revolutionary Alliance, until recently participating in the Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance. This organization specializes in penetrating military agencies in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, plotting military rebellion by the National Army, local troops, and senior generals, in order to welcome the Communist army to cross the Yangtze River. It is a planned and purposeful incitement organization. In the past few months, several mutinies have been caused by Xu's instigation: In February of this year, Tao Hongzhao, commander of the Second Jiangsu Security Brigade and commander of the Zhenjiang city defense, was first instigated by Xu to attempt to welcome the Communist army to cross the Yangtze River at the end of February. Fortunately, the authorities discovered it early and arrested Tao on February 24 with lightning speed. This was Xu's first instigation attempt. Because Xu was a legislator, the security agency personnel only sent personnel to follow and monitor him and did not arrest him. In late March, Wang Yanchang, commander of the 97th Division stationed in Tangshan, a suburb of Nanjing, led his troops to defect to the Communists. This was Xu's second instigation attempt. At the same time, Xu sent Zhang Dasheng (member of the Huaiyin Huazhong District Working Committee of the Communist Army's Fourth Army Commander), Chen Titi (former member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, currently the person in charge of the Shanghai branch of the alliance), and Yan Yimin (identity unknown) to Shanghai to conduct activities with the garrison troops. They were arrested by security agency personnel on March 28 while holding a secret meeting at the Nanjing Hotel on Shanxi Road. Recently, a mutiny occurred among some officers and soldiers of the pre-cadre corps stationed in Jiaxing, which was Xu's third instigation attempt. The above are the major examples. Xu has conducted activities with more than a dozen other units, and the security agency has collected confirmed intelligence and evidence, believing that at a time when the Communist army is attempting to cross the Yangtze River, it is essential to ensure security in Jiangnan. Xu's actions affect public morale, so they had no choice but to order Xu's arrest on the 10th of this month. Another legislator, Jin Shaoxian, was mistakenly arrested because he worked with Xu. After investigation, he was released immediately. After Xu was arrested, he admitted without hesitation to instigating the mutiny during questioning, and wrote a detailed account of the instigation process in his confession, saying that the mutinous troops were under the command of Communist Army commander Chen Yi. Because legislators who are not caught in the act cannot be arrested according to the Constitution, the security agency escorted Xu to Nanjing by overnight train the day before yesterday to complete the legal procedures before formally interrogating him. A total of seven people were arrested in this case. In addition to Xu Wentian, Tao Hongzhao, Chen Titi, Zhang Dasheng, and Yan Yimin, there were also Fang Zhinong (secretary of the Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance) and Lu Bihu (current county magistrate of Jiangning County, former chief of the Longhua North Station Police Sub-bureau in Shanghai), who were also arrested in the same case. In addition, the heads of the alliance's propaganda department and liaison department, labor movement social department, finance department, and speech research committee are all well-known figures. The security agency is rushing to complete the procedures and will round them up in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency This City Dispatch] Regarding the arrest of legislator Xu Wentian, the reporter visited General Commander Tang Enbo. According to Tang, the personnel handling this case were unfamiliar with legal procedures and acted rashly, which he regretted very much. The personnel handling this case have now been detained and will be severely punished, and Xu was escorted back to Nanjing on the night of the 11th.</p>

<h3>Truman Sends Special Message to Congress Urging Approval of the North Atlantic Treaty; Emphasizes that the Treaty is an Important Step Towards the Road to Peace; Senate Debate Will Take at Least One Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Washington, 12th Broadcast: President Truman has submitted the North Atlantic Treaty to the Senate for approval. The President's message to the Senate stated that the treaty is an important step in realizing the American people's determination to establish a just and lasting peace. The President also indirectly denied the Soviet Union's accusation that the treaty conflicts with the United Nations Charter. The President stated that the 12 signatory countries of the treaty are exercising their right to "collective or individual self-defense against aggressors" in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. The President originally intended to send a letter to the Senate only, but because he was eager for the treaty to be approved as soon as possible, he decided to send another message on the weekend. The President stated, "This treaty is only one step on the road to peace, for to seek peace is not something that can be accomplished by taking just one action. We must continue to consider the environment with caution and patience and take practical and realistic steps to build a sound and solid peace. This treaty is drafted to address the current actual situation, based on the United Nations Charter and the United States Constitution. This treaty truly represents the American people's desire for peace and security and the continued opportunity to live and work freely." The President did not address the economic responsibilities that the United States should bear in implementing the treaty. The President also stated, "The people of the North Atlantic group have now reached a sacred agreement, guaranteeing the security of all small countries, so that their peace and rights will no longer be threatened by terror and oppression. All countries share weal and woe, for economic prosperity or military security cannot be achieved by the sole efforts of one country."</p>
<p>The President also stated that the "combined strength" of the North Atlantic Treaty nations will be of extreme importance to the free people of the world in the future. Since all countries are committed to human rights and justice, differences in language and political and economic systems will not become obstacles to international unity. The establishment of this treaty is proof of this.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington, 11th Dispatch] Before the provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty become binding on the United States, they must first be approved by a two-thirds majority of the Senate. It is generally believed that the treaty will be approved. Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, revealed today that the hearing on the security alliance will begin next Monday and will continue to hold "fully open" discussions for about a month.</p>

<h3>Lie Proposes Establishing International Guard Force, Soviet Bloc Firmly Opposes, Political Committee Refers to Fourteen-Nation Subcommittee for Study</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 11th] Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie's proposal to establish an International Guard Force of 800 personnel to protect United Nations mediators caused heated debate in the Second Political Committee of the General Assembly today. The Soviet bloc argued that this move violated the United Nations Charter, and that such a guard force would only facilitate military and political intervention in foreign countries by the United States and Britain. The Polish representative, Suchi, said, "I hope that the Secretary-General will not propose unconstitutional suggestions again. The Secretary-General's hands are already full of unconstitutional actions, such as the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the Atlantic Treaty, and so on. The Secretary-General should instead encourage the member states, especially those generally busy organizing armies outside the United Nations, to devote themselves to the establishment of a United Nations army." The Soviet representative, Malik, stated that the plan to establish a guard force attempts to bypass the Security Council and replace it with an international police force. Subsequently, the committee voted 41 to 6 (the Soviet bloc voting against, with three abstentions) to establish a fourteen-nation subcommittee to study Lie's proposal and submit a report to the General Assembly this autumn. The Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia were also appointed as subcommittee representatives, but those countries may refuse to participate.</p>

<h3>Japan Follows Germany's Lead</h3>
<p>Allied Powers Lifting Military Control over Germany Will Set Precedent for Relaxing Control over Japan</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 12th] An Allied diplomat stated today that the lifting of military control over Germany might set a precedent for relaxing control over Japan. There is almost unanimous agreement that controls can be relaxed, and this is inevitable, but there are doubts as to whether Japan can automatically escape from its post-war economic plight. Once a West German government is established, world attention may shift to Japan to see if it can become self-reliant. At that time, some pressure may arise to try the same approach in Japan, including pressure from the Japanese themselves.</p>

<p>[United Press, Bonn, 12th] The prime ministers of the German states jointly issued a declaration today stating that the West German occupation regulations did not realize Germany's important wishes, such as Germany's foreign trade still being subject to control, but that these regulations are also a fundamental step in rebuilding the sovereignty of the German people.

<h3>Why Has the United States Lost Ground in Asia?</h3>
<p>— Translated by Special Correspondent from Our Newspaper</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been successful by exploiting the traditional assets of Chinese peasants and the public's resentment towards the Nationalist government. Chinese peasants are the easiest to manipulate, and the CCP's promise to give them land is a powerful attraction. These peasants support the CCP in the hope that a change of situation will improve their fate. A certain Chinese Communist Party member told that interviewer: "Our most effective propaganda is land."</p>
<p>This propaganda is very effective. Once a region is occupied by the Communist army, there are very few peasants there who strive for the return of the Nationalist army. The CCP leaders have managed to make the peasants benefit from the civil war, so none of them are willing to risk their lives to fight for the return of the Nationalist army.</p>
<p>American officials, who support the Nationalist Party as the strongest anti-communist force, have no way to thoroughly reform the Nationalist government and eliminate the corruption that even Chiang Kai-shek has condemned. According to an American official stationed in China, for every dollar the United States invests in combating the CCP, it receives back less than ten cents.</p>
<p>Foreigners traveling in China have received proof of the Nationalist Party's poor anti-communist capabilities. Americans who have worked for many years to improve the effectiveness of the Nationalist government, with few exceptions, seem to find that their efforts are met with failure everywhere.</p>
<p>Now, in response to the CCP's victory, some suggest that the United States land its army in China to maintain the remaining part of China. But the reactions from all sides are very sensitive. Some officials in the US State Department believe that this action may involve the Americans in an endless war whirlpool, with the risk of being unanimously opposed by non-communist elements in China.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia Unanimously Opposes</p>
<p>The traditional color of colonialism has died in this region. The people of Indonesia and Vietnam are almost frantically demanding to get rid of the rule of the Netherlands and France. Because the United States desperately promoted the importance of the four basic freedoms and people's autonomy during the war, the rebel leaders fully hoped that the United States would help them fight for freedom. Now their dreams have been shattered and they feel resentment. They blame the United States for standing by.</p>
<p>Recently, a journalist traveled to Indonesia and witnessed the public's deep hatred of the Dutch and the rising anti-American sentiment. Most Indonesians believe that the United States is only paying lip service to the Indonesian Republic, while indirectly helping the Netherlands maintain the East Indies. Because the European Recovery Program includes France and the Netherlands, people in the Far East feel that the United States is not only not helping the colonies, but is favoring the colonizing countries.</p>
<p>Although the United States has strongly criticized the Dutch military operations in Indonesia (which the Dutch call "police actions") in the United Nations, the rebel leaders demand that the United States follow up its strong words with strong actions. The Communist Party has repeatedly announced to the Indonesian people that they have been betrayed by the United States. This policy of the Communist Party has gained a foothold.</p>
<p>On the bookstalls in Yogyakarta, the capital of the Indonesian Republic, there are almost entirely Marxist propaganda pamphlets. A 23-year-old Indonesian journalist frankly told an American reporter that he would be willing to take on underground work and follow any leader - even a communist - to participate in guerrilla warfare against the Dutch.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, a French official estimated that 95 percent of the natives were Nationalists, determined to resist French rule. An underground army has encircled the French in six cities, and even these areas are not safe places.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Vietnamese guerrillas hoped that the United States would help them fight for independence. On the contrary, US Lend-Lease weapons appeared on the French side. Therefore, they turned to the Communist Party and let them lead the struggle for freedom.</p>
<p>A young medical graduate, who had just returned from the front line of guerrilla warfare, spoke to an American reporter about the United States' assistance to France through the Marshall Plan, and was filled with indignation. He explained in the following words why he supported Vietnamese Communist leader Ho Chi Minh: "We follow Ho Chi Minh not as communists, but as nationalists. We have no other way. Even those who oppose communism would rather be ruled by our own communists than by the French."</p>
<p>The Good Feelings of the Past Have Been Completely Lost</p>
<p>Since the end of the war against Japan, various parts of Asia have repeatedly shown disappointment with the United States. The American promises of the four basic freedoms that inspired the Burmese people to fight for independence were distributed in leaflets. The people of Malaya were convinced that it was the Americans, not the British, who could liberate them. They posted slogans in the towns saying: "Expel the Japanese and welcome the Americans."</p>
<p>An American journalist who traveled to ten countries in the Far East for eight months obtained an impression that can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The chaotic situation in Vietnam and Indonesia continues to exist, and most of it is attributed to the United States (whether it is fair is another question).</p>
<p>The United States' policy of supporting and funding the Chiang Kai-shek government has cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and has not had the slightest significant effect on curbing the progress of the CCP. The prestige of the United States is gradually being lost.</p>
<p>Since the United States has pursued a policy of supporting Japan's recovery, it has gradually alienated the Asian countries that are closely related to Japan's recovery. People in the Far East suspect that the result of the American occupation of Japan may create a Japan that is neither strong and democratic, nor a reliable ally of the West.</p>
<p>In short, a journalist who has had many years of experience in the East, after visiting various parts of Asia, has come to a belief: that the United States' Far East policy, in the past three years, has sacrificed all the good feelings that the United States previously enjoyed in this complex region.

<h3>Authorities Seek to Resolve Economic Crisis: First Economic Meeting Summarizes Four Resolutions, Asks National Bank to Draft Measures for Using Bills</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's Economic Conference was held at the City Hall at 4 PM yesterday, chaired by Secretary-General Chen Liang. Attendees included Zhou Lixing from the Garrison Headquarters, Xiong Daji from the Coal Adjustment Office, Gu Yuzhen from the China Textile Company, Xie Renzhao from the Transportation Control Commission, Peng Shouyi from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, Yan Esheng from the City Chamber of Commerce, Zhou Shunxin from the National Bank, Qin Zengyuan from the Gold Management Bureau, Zhang Xu from the China Trust Bureau, Yang Chaoan from the Food Department's Procurement and Storage Committee, Ouyang Lun from the Industrial Association, Ye Fucang, Liu Qingyi, Cao Peizi, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhong Zigang from the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, and Xiang Changquan from the City Council, among others. Secretary-General Chen first clarified that in order to suppress price increases, the task of the Economic Conference is extremely important. The current economic situation has reached its most serious stage, and all sectors must work together to seek a reasonable solution. The holding of the Economic Conference can allow the responsible authorities to exchange opinions and work together actively. Subsequently, the conference discussed the organization outline of the conference, approved the draft organization of the Shanghai Economic Conference, and decided to hold regular meetings every Tuesday, and to convene temporary meetings when necessary. Then, Ye Fucang explained the reason why the price increase has evolved from a curve to a straight line increase, because the people's psychology has recognized silver dollars as currency, and the Gold Yuan has ceased to exist. He also made two suggestions to the government: (1) Unify the price of silver dollars, the price of large heads, small heads, and eagle dollars should be unified, and silver dollar deposits should be organized. (2) Bills cannot be used on the same day, which is a great hindrance to legitimate merchants, and the Central Government should make changes. Zhou Lixing then suggested eight points: (1) In order to maintain the credit of the currency, in addition to the National Bank issuing promissory notes, commercial banks should be restricted, and those that have been issued should be recalled within a time limit. (2) Strictly prohibit the use of gold and US dollars as collateral. (3) The prices of public utilities should be restricted, and the subsidy policy should still be restored. (4) Production loans should be restricted, and in the future, loans must be based on a bill of lading before lending is allowed. (5) The price of food and main daily necessities should implement a price negotiation policy. (6) Remove public telephones. (7) Ban or rationally manage silver dollar vendors. (8) Warehouse receipts must be registered, and the practice of "kicking the ball" should be strictly prohibited. He said that the first four points are fundamental solutions, and the last four points are temporary solutions, and they must be implemented in a complementary manner. Subsequently, Zhong Zigang suggested a method for the National Bank to organize silver dollar deposits. Later, Zhou Shunxin from the National Bank stated two points: (1) The problem that bills cannot be used on the same day is that after the National Bank massively dumped gold on April 4, the nine banks and firms in the city automatically made this request to the National Bank for the sake of their own safety. (2) Regarding the issue of silver dollar deposits, the Ministry of Finance originally had this intention, but no concrete measures have been formulated so far. Regarding the unification of silver dollar prices and the supervision of the market, the Garrison Headquarters suggested that all silver dollar merchants should be registered, business licenses should be issued, and designated trading areas should be designated. The Social Affairs Bureau suggested that the original members of the Silver Money Industry Association should be responsible for the buying and selling of silver dollars, and all other illegal transactions should be banned. After detailed discussion at the meeting, Secretary-General Chen summarized the discussion and decided on the following four points: (1) The plan for improving the use of bills will be drafted by the National Bank in conjunction with the Gold Management Bureau and submitted for discussion at the next meeting. If there are provisions in the usage plan promulgated by the Central Government, they should be improved with reference to the current environmental needs. If there are no explicit provisions, they should be supplemented. (2) The case of unifying silver dollar prices and improving transactions should be drafted by the National Bank and submitted for discussion at the next meeting. (3) The case of handling silver dollar deposits should be drafted by the National Bank and submitted for discussion at the meeting. (4) The case of reviewing the prices of major daily necessities and supervising the market will be drafted by the Municipal Government in conjunction with the Garrison Headquarters and submitted for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Authorities Decide to Dump Large Amounts of Silver Dollars, Purchase Silver from the US for Minting in China</h3>
<p>Since the opening of free trading of silver dollars, the market price has risen day and night, and yesterday it was more than 40,000 times higher than the price limit during the August 19th period, breaking all price increase records, stimulating general price increases, and greatly affecting people's livelihood. The relevant authorities are paying close attention to this. According to a China East News Agency reporter, the authorities decided to start dumping large amounts of silver dollars in Shanghai to curb the factors of price increases. In addition to the large amount of silver dollars exchanged during the price limit period and the new ship oceans from the Central Mint, a huge amount of silver dollars has been newly ordered from Australia. The first batch of more than one million pieces will be transported to Shanghai and will be dumped in Shanghai. Once the dumping technology is negotiated, it will begin. According to the current US silver market price, it is 70 cents per ounce. Each silver dollar is 7.2 cents, equivalent to only 50 cents in US dollars. The current Shanghai silver dollar has exceeded one US dollar per piece. Therefore, the authorities have ordered a huge amount of silver from the United States, preparing to transport it to China for dumping.</p>
<h3>A Set Meal Costs 10,000 Gold Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to the drastic fluctuations in rice prices in the city, the prices of set meals continue to be adjusted. Yesterday, the price of set meals approved by the association was 10,000 yuan for Grade A, 8,600 yuan for Grade B, and 7,200 yuan for Grade C.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Flour Mills Face Raw Material Shortage, Approaching Major Crisis</h3>
<p>According to statistics from the Shanghai Area Flour Industry Association, the 37 flour mills in the city currently produce 3.2 million bags per month. However, the current supply of wheat along the Beijing-Shanghai line is only sufficient for flour mills in Wuxi and other areas. Shanghai's needs are not yet secured. If the government requires each factory to store six months' worth of materials, a large amount of low-interest loans and efforts to resolve wheat source difficulties will be necessary. Yesterday, a responsible person from a major flour mill told reporters that several long-established flour mills in the city will face a major crisis after the living index is released on the 15th of this month. How they will sustain operations three or four days later is currently unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese and Qinhuangdao Ships Arrive, Transporting Over Ten Thousand Tons of Coal</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Coal continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Yanping vessel of the Taiwan Navigation Company, carrying over 5,500 tons of coal jointly operated by four mines from Keelung, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and is currently unloading at the Fourth Mine's Second Wharf (formerly the Mitsui Wharf). Additionally, the Nanqiang vessel of the Nanhui Company, bringing 6,400 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao in exchange for flour, entered the port at approximately 4:00 PM yesterday and is currently unloading at the Kailuan Wharf. It also brought 354 bags of mail. The Huasheng vessel is currently docked at buoys 20 and 21 in Nanshi, loading flour, and is scheduled to continue sailing to Qinhuangdao to exchange it for coal tomorrow.</p>
<h3>North and South Negotiate Changes to the Flour-for-Coal Ratio</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Coal Transport Vessel Allocation Group of the Shipping Association, the first batch of 100,000 tons of Kailuan coal from Qinhuangdao has already been completely transported. The second batch is still under negotiation due to the exchange rate issue between flour and Kailuan coal. Because the Kailuan Coal Mine authorities believe that the coal price in Shanghai is very high, they are requesting four and a half bags of flour in exchange for one ton of Kailuan coal. After negotiations between the two parties, it is hoped that four bags of flour can be exchanged for one ton of coal. It is also reported that a contract will be signed within days. Currently, ten empty ships are waiting to load flour and head north. As for the ships going north, not any ship can participate. In addition to obtaining the approval of the Executive Yuan in advance, the consent of the CCP authorities in Beiping must also be obtained by telegram, otherwise it will be difficult to sail north. Therefore, currently, only fifteen ships have been approved to participate in the northbound voyage. According to shipping industry news, with the obstruction of shipping on the Yangtze River, the business of various shipping companies has become even more sluggish. More than 60 ships with a tonnage of approximately 1,000 to 3,000 tons are about to cease operations, so the crisis in the shipping industry is becoming increasingly serious.</p>
<h3>Vice Admiral Badger Arrives in Shanghai on Flagship</h3>
<p>Vice Admiral Badger, Commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, arrived here from Qingdao at 11:30 AM yesterday on the flagship "Eldorado." The duration of Badger's stay in Shanghai is undetermined. The "Eldorado" is scheduled to dock here for about ten days.</p>

<h3>National Property Inventory Group Decides on Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The National Property and Materials Inventory Group of the Control Yuan held a meeting at its office at 1688 Lin Sen Middle Road yesterday morning to discuss the procedures for all investigation operations and other preparatory matters. Due to insufficient attendance, it was temporarily changed to a discussion meeting. It was decided that the office would begin operations immediately and accept all complaints related to the investigation. The operations of the investigation group are divided into five groups: (1) National banks and bureaus, (2) Gold, silver, and foreign exchange, (3) State-owned enterprises, (4) Enemy and puppet industries, (5) US aid materials.

<h3>China Silk Association Board Meeting Resolves to Request Immediate Implementation of Silk Loans, Appointing Three Representatives to Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Silk is a special product of our country and ranks first in export trade, upon which the prosperity of rural areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang depends. Since the restoration, due to the devastation of rural areas, farmers have been unable to afford silkworm seeds, and manufacturers have also been unable to purchase fresh cocoons due to weak financial resources. Therefore, the government has implemented various low-interest loans for mulberry seedlings, seed production, silkworm rearing, and cocoon collection. The government purchases raw silk to encourage production. Since its implementation, the quality of raw silk has improved year by year. The government has been able to control a large amount of export materials, with annual silk exports reaching more than 10,000 piculs, increasing foreign exchange earnings. The rural economy has also recovered, enabling the purchase and storage of fertilizers and food rice, which is of great benefit to the stability of social order. Last autumn, due to currency reform, all loans were suspended, and silk loans could not be treated differently. As a result, the cocoon market was in chaos, and silkworm farmers had no way to sell their products, and were forced to steam and dry them, resulting in the loss of valuable raw materials, which is deeply regrettable. Now that the spring cocoon season is approaching, the China Silk Association, in view of the importance of silk loans, convened a joint meeting of the second board of directors and supervisors at 216 Wujin Road on the 10th of this month, chaired by Chairman Leng Yuqiu. A total of 59 directors and supervisors attended. First, Leng Yuqiu delivered a speech, followed by a detailed report by He Shangping, a standing director, on his trip to France last autumn to attend the World Raw Silk Conference. After unanimous resolution, telegrams were sent to the Executive Yuan and the Central Bank, requesting that various silk loans be implemented quickly to reassure farmers and merchants. Three representatives were appointed to go to Beijing to visit the competent authorities to petition, in order to prevent the goods from being abandoned on the ground and missing the agricultural season.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the key resolutions of the joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the association also include the establishment of a Silk Academic Research Committee to be responsible for research, publication, investigation and other work, in order to seek improvement.</p>
<h3>Fourth Meeting of the National College and University Staff Association</h3>
<p>Representatives to Beijing Report on Petition</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Area National College and University Staff Association held its fourth board meeting at the Sino-American Hospital affiliated to Tongji University yesterday. The representatives to Beijing reported on the progress of requesting tuition fees from the authorities. Following this, the following were discussed: (1) The Ministry of Education issued a circular to all colleges and universities to effectively protect the work of staff and not to dismiss them without reason. (2) Regarding the "April 1st" incident, the representatives to Beijing expressed their condolences to the injured students and presented 50,000 yuan in medical expenses. At yesterday's meeting, it was also decided to remit 200,000 yuan in condolences to the families of the deceased students and 200,000 yuan to the families of the deceased drivers. (3) Hunan University, Shandong University and other schools urged the initiation of a National College and University Staff Association. It was decided to temporarily reserve this matter. (4) The staff of Yingshi University were approved as members of the association. The applications for membership from Xiamen University and Shandong University were temporarily reserved due to the long distance. (5) The preferential treatment for staff of various member colleges and universities at the Sino-American Hospital has been agreed to in principle by the hospital and will be implemented soon.</p>

<h3>Cash Required for Train Tickets, Promissory Notes and Drafts Not Accepted</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, there has been a shortage of cash in the market, and promissory notes are rampant. The Railway Bureau sells tickets and stipulates that cash must be used. However, the general public is unaware of the truth and still uses promissory notes to request tickets from the North Station, resulting in repeated disputes. The railway authorities discussed the issue of promissory note purchases at a bureau affairs meeting some time ago. The result was based on Article 6 of the Eighth Edition Passenger Vehicle Transport Rules promulgated by the Ministry: "Railway fares must be paid in advance in cash. Checks, drafts, promissory notes, etc. will not be accepted unless prior contact has been made with the Railway Bureau." Based on the above regulations, the Railway Bureau has telegraphed all stations along the line to politely explain to passengers who use promissory notes to purchase tickets and ask them to purchase tickets with cash.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Torpedo Depot Staff Member Suspected of Colluding to Steal Public Property, Case Returned for Retrial, Detained for Two Years Without Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhuang Yijiang, former lieutenant administrator of the Torpedo Depot of the Navy's First Supply Headquarters, was dismissed after his superiors discovered that he had held a puppet position. On July 2, 1947, he was handed over to his successor, Chen Zaidao. At that time, the inventory was correct. However, Zhuang remained living in the depot and learned that Squad Leader Qian Wenzheng and his brother Zhuang Jinjiang intended to sell public property. Therefore, they colluded to steal 45 mine-sweeping ropes, 41 mine-sweeping tail ropes, 38 buoy ropes, 180 magnetic pole lowering ropes, 200 meters of mine-sweeping wire, and a box of pressure gauge testers. On August 4 of the same year, Chen cleaned the warehouse and found that a large number of items were missing. Subsequently, a box of the stolen pressure gauge testers was found at the home of Gu Huidong, a classmate of Zhuang living nearby. At that time, Zhuang and others had all fled. Gu, in order to avoid suspicion, tried to find Zhuang's whereabouts and ran into him in his hometown of Suzhou, so he reported to the police and he was arrested and sent to the Navy First Base Command for interrogation and sentenced to 12 years. Subsequently, the Naval Headquarters ordered the department to transfer him to the local court on the grounds that Zhuang's crime occurred after he was dismissed from office and exempted from military service. After investigation and prosecution, he was sentenced to five years imprisonment by the court on October 25 of last year. The defendant appealed and on December 24 of the same year, the High Court returned the case for retrial. Yesterday, the court reopened the trial, and Zhuang flatly denied the facts of the crime. Because other defendants, Gu Huidong, Qian Wenzheng, Zhuang Jinjiang, and Chen Zaidao, were not present, the trial was adjourned to a later date. The defendant's lawyer requested bail because Zhuang's crime has not yet been determined and he has been detained for two years. However, the court refused to grant bail on the grounds that the case involved the theft and sale of military public property, which was a serious matter, and promised to close the case as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Rubbings of Han Dynasty Brick and Stone Portraits to be Exhibited Regularly at the Museum</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Museum of this city is scheduled to hold an exhibition of rubbings of Han Dynasty brick and stone portraits in the newly built Faculty of Arts and Sciences classroom of Tongji University at the end of North Sichuan Road, starting from May 20. The exhibition has been in preparation for a long time, and all the rubbings obtained from collectors have been mounted by the museum's technical department. However, due to the cramped museum building, there is no suitable place for display, so it has been postponed. Now, at the request of the National Tongji University, it will be held regularly.</p>
<h3>Convicted of Buying Stolen Goods, Acquitted on Appeal, Counter-suit for Conspiracy and False Accusation Concluded, Fists Fly Upon Leaving the Courtroom, Alerting Patrol Police to Chase and Arrest</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Liyue from Siyang, in July 1948, purchased a batch of stolen goods from the Third Ordnance Depot for 60 million legal tender, including two gas masks, three water dragons, and one wire mesh, which were deposited at Li's residence at No. 10 Songdong Lane, Qipu Road. The incident was discovered by Wu Jingfu, a storekeeper at the depot, who reported it to the police and was arrested. The case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. On October 19, 1948, the court sentenced Zhang to two months imprisonment for the crime of knowingly buying stolen goods. Zhang appealed, and on February 22 of this year, the High Court reversed the verdict and acquitted him. Zhang then filed a complaint with the court accusing Wu and Wang Zhaoyun and Zhuo Xian of conspiring to falsely accuse him of buying stolen goods and of intimidation and extortion. According to the complaint, Wang and others falsely accused him of buying stolen goods to the North Station Police Station on August 26, 1948. The police station dispatched officers to search but found nothing. The next day, Wang and others went to Li's residence at Qipu Road and arrested Peng Xuehua, a worker, and illegally detained him in Jiangwan. On the 28th, they came to Zhang's house and threatened him, saying that 1 billion legal tender was needed to settle the case, otherwise he would be detained along with Peng. Zhang and others refused. On the 31st, Wang and others came again, intending to arrest Zhang. Fortunately, he was out. They forcibly dragged Zhang's wife, Luo Xiuzhen, out. Zhang's wife cried out, and Sun Jinhui, a passerby, stepped forward to intervene. Wang and others fled, and Zhuo slipped and was held by Sun, who called the police and transferred him to the North Station Police Station, where he was released on bail shortly thereafter. It can be seen that Wang and others used violence, threats, intimidation and fraud to obtain money. The evidence is conclusive. He requests a clear judgment. Yesterday, the court opened the trial. Zhang and his wife testified in great detail. Only Wang, one of the defendants, appeared in court. Wu and Zhuo did not attend. The trial was concluded and a judgment was announced on the 19th of this month. Unexpectedly, as soon as the two parties left the court, they started fighting outside the court. The bailiffs intervened. Wang immediately rode a bicycle and fled. Zhang and others chased after him, shouting loudly. The guard police outside the court were alerted and drove after him. A commotion broke out on North Zhejiang Road for a while.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Electric Construction Company (British) Decides on Salary Payment Method, Divided into Two Payments per Month</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The workers of the Shanghai Electric Construction Company (British) requested to borrow wages in advance, following the precedents of the other five major public utility companies.

At 4:00 PM yesterday, the company's General Manager and Secretary, Applebrock, Personnel Section Chief Cornell, and labor representatives Qiu Changjiang, Xu Yingwei and others gathered at the Social Affairs Bureau. Under the personal mediation of Shen Lu, Director of the Labor Section of the bureau, it was decided to change the salary payment dates of the 7th, 17th, and 18th of each month to the 5th and 20th of each month. The payment on the 5th is one-half of the half-month's salary from the 1st to the 15th, based on the index of the 30th of the previous month. The payment on the 20th is one-half of the half-month's salary from the 16th to the 30th, based on the index of the 15th, and the shortfall in the first half of the month is supplemented according to the index of the 15th. On May 5th, in addition to the payment of one-half of the half-month's salary, the shortfall in the second half of April will be supplemented according to the index of April 30th. This will be continued in this manner. The company has agreed, and due to the fact that the payment date for the first half of April has passed, each employee will first advance 200,000 yuan before the 15th, and this method will begin to be implemented from the 20th of this month.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Zhang Danxiang and Jiang He, supervisors of the Ministry of Education, went to Beijing from Shanghai to request instructions from the Ministry of Education on handling the problem of refugee students, and returned to Shanghai yesterday.

<h3>Industrial Association Cables for Tax Exemption on Raw Materials Imported for Export Products</h3>
<p>The Municipal Industrial Association believes that recently, industrial products exported from our country, such as textiles, thermos bottles, enamelware, rubber products, aluminum products, umbrellas, needles, and nails, are exported in considerable quantities. However, the raw materials are mostly dependent on imports, and the imported raw materials are already expensive. In addition, shipping costs are controlled by others and are not easy to reduce, so the cost is higher and the price of finished products must also increase, resulting in difficulties in export. They have no place in the European and American markets, and even sales in Southeast Asia are threatened. The tariff preference is our right, and the government can exempt or refund taxes to encourage exports. For this reason, the association has cabled the relevant departments, ministries, and commissions, requesting that all foreign raw materials used for imported be completely tax-exempt, or that taxes be refunded when finished products are exported, in order to reduce costs and compete in the international market.</p>

<h3>Youth Imposes as Colonel Director, Gang Plunders Property of French Residents</h3>
<p>Two Police Stations Arrest Four Criminals</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yin Jie, a local, 25 years old, living upstairs at the Fuxing Noodle Restaurant at 490 Madang Road, recently impersonated a colonel director of the Shanghai Office of the Nanjing China Times of the Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and was engaged in swindling and deceiving. On the morning of the 9th of this month, he colluded with Yu Peng, Xie Min, Cao Jinde, and others to intimidate the French resident Tao Erdong at No. 51 Nanchang Road, accusing Tao of secretly hiding military weapons, and took the opportunity to rob him of 1,000 US dollars, a camera, and a clock before escaping without a trace. Afterwards, Tao reported the incident to the police station and requested an investigation. The Songshan Police Station received the report and immediately dispatched Song Tingjun, chief of the branch, along with judicial section chief Zhong He, and staff members Tan Delin and Fan Lewu to investigate. They finally arrested Yin at dawn the day before yesterday and seized a pistol, two bullets, and the original stolen camera and clock, as well as 19 silver dollars. At the same time, the Lujiawan Police Station also arrested the three criminals, Yu Peng and others, at the Shi Mao Hotel. Because the case occurred in the Lujiawan District, Yin was immediately transferred to that bureau for joint investigation.</p>
<h3>Dada Ship Arrives from Ningbo, Passenger Arrested for Transporting Drugs</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Maritime Unified Inspection Post of the Garrison Command cracked a drug trafficking case yesterday. At approximately 8:00 AM yesterday morning, when the Dada Ship arrived at the city's dock from Ningbo, Chief Wang Hongjun led inspection personnel Wu Zhenzhong, Jin Hui, and Fan Guanghan to inspect passengers and found that Zhang Azhuang, a native of Ningbo, was acting suspiciously. After ordering him to open his suitcase for inspection, they found more than 60 ounces of opium hidden inside. Zhang Azhuang and the seized opium were immediately escorted to the Maritime Unified Inspection Post for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Smuggled Goods Seized Outside Wusong Breakwater, British Navy Oil Tanker Protects Smuggling, Our Customs Lodge Serious Protest</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The Jianghai Customs recently cracked a large-scale smuggling incident using a foreign military vessel. The case is serious. On the morning of the 11th of this month, the British Navy oil supply ship "Green Laurel Bridge" arrived at the port and anchored outside the Wusong Breakwater. In the distance, customs officers were closely watching from the Wusong Branch Customs observation post with binoculars, and deployed on land and water to intercept smuggled ships and vehicles at any time. At 4:30 PM, they glimpsed four civilian boats leaving the oil tanker and immediately dispatched customs launches to pursue them. When the civilian boats saw the customs launches, they fled in different directions, trying to reach the shoals. The customs officers risked danger to pursue them and eventually captured all of them. One boat was full of smuggled goods, totaling 82 pieces, mostly wool, saccharin, and radios. The other three boats were loaded with escorts and coolies. According to the confessions of smugglers Xie Shutang and Yan Baosun, this was an organized smuggling operation. They loaded the goods in Hong Kong onto a warship, and Xie Shutang escorted them on the ship. Yan Baosun took a plane to Shanghai to prepare for civilian boats and cars to pick them up. The arrangements were extremely meticulous. If the customs officers had not been alert and loyal, it would have been difficult to solve the case. The smuggled goods have now been escorted to the customs office for counting, and the smugglers will be transferred to the court for handling. It is shocking that the British Navy would use a supply ship to cover smuggling. It is learned that the Jianghai Customs has lodged a serious protest.</p>
<h3>Sanmihao Embezzles Rice Rations, Case Unresolved After Fifth Hearing</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Dai Yuanbi, Cai Zong, and Gu Binsong are the persons in charge of the Yuansheng, Songsheng, and Tongfeng Tong Sanmihao in this city. On May 29, 1947, they were entrusted by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to handle the distribution of rice rations per household, five liters per household. At that time, there were incidents of embezzling rice rations, ranging from three to five ounces. They were reported to the police by local residents Zhu Zhaomei, Ji Yimin, and Shen Changfa, and transferred to the court for trial. They were each sentenced to seven years in prison. Subsequently, the defendants disagreed and appealed to the High Court. On July 17, 1948, the High Court returned the case for retrial. Yesterday, the court held the fifth hearing, but the case was adjourned again because the case files were not complete.</p>
<h3>P'u-tung Nearly Becomes a Den of Thieves: More Than Ten Men and Women Arrested in Two Operations</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] On the afternoon of the eleventh, around 3 p.m., the First Squadron of the Yangjing District Auxiliary Police received a tip that a large number of bandits were hiding in the district, plotting a robbery. The squadron's Deputy Commander, Zhang Haigen, ordered the Fifth Platoon Leader, Yang Lijing, and the Sixth Platoon Leader, Gong Shijia, to quickly investigate and make arrests. The two platoon leaders swiftly identified the bandits' hideout using rapid investigation methods. Around 10 p.m. that evening, they led squad leaders Zhu Jianliang and Yang Shiliang, along with officers Ben Zhipeng, Zhang Genquan, and more than ten others, and went with the head of the "bao" system to No. 479, Yu Family Temple. They found five or six male and female bandits sleeping together on one bed. When the officers broke down the door, the bandits were alerted and immediately opened fire to resist arrest. Fortunately, the officers were alert and swiftly knocked down the bandit who opened fire in the dark, seizing the firearm. The remaining bandits surrendered. They then found another handgun and four bullets. The arrested bandits included Tian Changcai from Haizhou, Wu Sanxiao and Wu Zhu-shi from Taizhou, Xia Mingfu, and Chu Guanyuan, a total of six people. They were immediately handed over to the Yangjing Sub-bureau. Subsequently, another bandit revealed that the firearms and ammunition were supplied by a soldier named Zhou Zhenwu from "Eighteen Rooms." Based on this lead, the sub-bureau rushed to arrest Zhou at 3 a.m. Upon interrogation, Zhou confessed that he did not have a military identity but had committed crimes more than once. The Yangjing Sub-bureau is currently conducting further investigations.</p>
<p>Another report: Around 8 p.m. on the same afternoon, the Zhabei Police Sub-bureau, after discovering that bandits Zhao Haigen and others were hiding in Yangjiazhai in Pudong, ordered Section Chief Jiang Ying to instruct Patrol Officer Wang Shusheng to lead officers to Pudong to make arrests. They also requested assistance from the Yangjing Sub-bureau. However, due to insufficient personnel, Auxiliary Police Commander Zhang Haigen ordered the First Squadron, attached with Yu Jialiang, to lead more than ten officers to assist in the operation. They divided into groups to conduct a search and arrested a notorious bandit, Zhao Haigen, at No. 39, Lane 53, Yangjiazhai. They continued to Shenjialong South End and arrested Mao, an accomplice. They continued to arrest Yang Xigen and two Zhu surname thieves near Qianjiaxiang, and seized two fake handguns and a batch of stolen goods. All the arrested persons and stolen goods were handed over to Patrol Officer Wang to be taken back to the Zhabei Sub-bureau for punishment.</p>
<h3>Commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Protection Inspects Defense Lines</h3>
<p>Wu Zhiqin, the commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Protection Command, departed from Shanghai yesterday by train to inspect the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line to strengthen the railway defense. He provided instructions on the combat deployment, defense arrangements, engineering facilities, and military discipline of the railway protection units along the line. This is intended to cooperate with the military authorities and ensure the security of the Nanjing-Shanghai railway and highway, especially amidst increasingly strained river defenses.</p>
<h3>Both Railways Automatically Adjust Freight Rates: Minister of Communications Personally Orders Railway Bureau to Stop: Promises to Discuss a Thorough Solution with Both Houses of Parliament: May Still Adjust Three Times Monthly According to a Standard Formula</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Administration originally planned to automatically adjust passenger and freight rates starting today. Yesterday morning, Minister of Communications, Duanmu, personally called the directors of both railway bureaus, Wang Zhaohuai, and ordered them to stop the automatic price increases. However, he expressed deep sympathy for the current economic difficulties and the significant disparity between income and expenditure of the two railways. He promised to discuss a thorough solution with the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, potentially restoring the formulaic adjustment method of three times a month. Therefore, passenger fares on both railways will remain at the original price today. A spokesperson for the bureau told reporters that with such rampant inflation, maintaining fixed railway fares and adjusting them periodically would make it impossible to survive. The 7 billion yuan subsidy from the Ministry of Communications to both railways in April was received yesterday, but even after using it to repay the Central Bank, there was still a shortage of 1.380 tons of coal payment. (According to the loan borrowed from the Central Bank to purchase coal, the settlement is based on the coal price of the day). Currently, the coal reserves of the two railways in Nanjing can last until the 24th of this month, and those in Shanghai until the 15th. All other major stations will last until the 16th. It is expected that they will have to go to the Central Bank to borrow coal again in the next few days. The old debts are not cleared, and new debts are added. If this continues, the debt will become increasingly insurmountable, and all the assets of the two railways will be insufficient to cover it. The salaries owed to employees for March were only paid off yesterday, and the salaries for April are likely to be delayed until May.</p>
<p>Possible New Fare Implementation on the 15th</p>
<p>The Guangdong-Hankou Railway has already adjusted its fares from the 4th of this month, setting the passenger fare for third-class at one silver dollar per kilometer, and for express trains at 1.2 cents, which is twelve times higher than that of the two railways. The new fare planned by the two railways for implementation on the 13th has become inapplicable due to the soaring prices in the past three days. The Ministry of Communications has now agreed to consider a thorough solution, which the employees of the two railways and those concerned about the traffic of the two railways are welcoming. However, the economic difficulties of the two railways have reached a critical point and urgently need to be resolved. Therefore, the new fare may be implemented on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Case of the Sunken "Yugang" Vessel Due to Disrepair: Chief Captain and Others Indicted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The "Yugang" vessel of the Fisheries Administration, which was overdue for repairs, sank due to a typhoon, causing multiple deaths and injuries. The case has been concluded after repeated investigations by the District Prosecutor's Office. The chief captain of the vessel, Si Songxin, the deputy chief captain, Liu Lianghan, and the head of the Maritime Affairs Section of the administration and concurrently the Business Section Chief of the Chief Captain's Office, Chen Shuyi, have been indicted on charges of causing death by negligence. It is reported that the "Yugang" vessel was inspected by personnel from the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications on July 9th of last year, and the certificate issued had a validity period of three months, which was due to expire on October 8th of last year. When it went out to sea on October 11th, the captain of the vessel, Wang Jingsheng, went to Qingdao on official business, and Kan Zhaoyuan acted as captain in his place. On the 15th of the same month, the vessel collided with the "Yuxin" vessel in Shenjiamen, Zhejiang, and the bow was damaged. They hired carpenters locally to repair it, but the ship continued to leak. The crew members of the vessel believed that continuing to go out to sea would be dangerous, so they telegraphed Si and Liu for instructions. Si and Liu, upon receiving the report, ordered them to continue to go out to sea. On the 25th of the same month, the vessel returned to Shanghai. After inspection by Wang Yebo, the foreman of the carpentry team at the Ship Repair Factory of the Post-War Rehabilitation Committee, it was confirmed that the vessel had cracks below the waterline and was leaking water, and needed to be repaired in the shipyard. Si and Liu believed that the profits from going out to sea were very high and did not want to stop. When the original captain Wang Jingsheng returned to Shanghai from Qingdao after completing his official duties, he requested major repairs, but they did not allow it and ordered Wang to lead the crew to continue going out to sea. As a result, the vessel sank in the northeast sea of Nanfei Mountain in Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province (i.e., 122 degrees 45 minutes east longitude and 28 degrees 50 minutes north latitude) at noon on December 14th due to a typhoon. All personnel on board, including Captain Wang Jingsheng, Deputy Captain Zhu Zijun, Chief Engineer Huang Hang, Second Officer Xin Yebin, Fishing Foreman Jiang Guoliang, Fisherman Gao Tongde, fishermen Jiang Axiang, Jiang Ruyun, Wu Xuecheng, Shen Laizhang, Wu Kunxing, and intern Shi, were drowned. Later, after learning of the incident, the administration sent a ship to rescue them and only recovered the body of Jiang Axiang, which was transported to Shanghai. The families of the victims suspected that Zhao Junmai, the director of the administration, Wang Yikang, the deputy director, and Si, Liu, and Chen had committed crimes, so they jointly filed a petition for investigation.</p>
<h3>Several Industries, Including Hardware and Toothbrushes, Refuse to Collect Security Donations on Behalf: Authorities Urge Prompt Payment</h3>
<p>In order to subsidize the food expenses of the garrison troops, Mayor Wu began collecting local security donations at the beginning of last month. Since the collection began, the donation situation of various important industrial and commercial sectors in the city has been quite enthusiastic. However, up to now, the Local Security Donation Committee has found that industries such as hardware, toothbrush, cigar, machinery, beer trade, insurance trade, securities trade, and real estate trade have not yet donated. Yesterday, the municipal government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to conduct thorough inquiries and urge them to do so. Because it concerns local safety, it is necessary to order them to pay promptly. In addition, the committee has also compiled a list of members of the industries that have already begun collecting donations who refuse to comply and has requested the Social Affairs and Police Bureaus to conduct inquiries and urge them to do so. Those who fail to pay the donation within the deadline will be subject to an additional "late fee" as a penalty, as stipulated: (1) Within five days of the deadline, an additional 20% of the donation amount will be charged. (2) Within ten days of the deadline, an additional 50% will be charged. (3) Within fifteen days of the deadline, an additional 150% will be charged. (4) Those who fail to pay within fifteen days will be reported to higher authorities for severe punishment.</p>

<h3>All Jiangsu Power Plants Face Closure: Seeking Emergency Loans from the National Bank</h3>
<p>Since coal and oil prices have been dynamically adjusted according to the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar, power plants in Jiangsu Province have faced significant threats. Moreover, due to price fluctuations, coal prices and electricity prices are often out of sync. In addition, due to factors such as the forced use of current, they have suffered heavy losses and are on the verge of closure. Yesterday, the Jiangsu Electrical Industry Association held an emergency meeting in Shanghai, gathering members from companies across the province to discuss several important proposals. In the afternoon, they invited Speaker Pang Shusen of the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly to visit President Liu of the Central Bank to request an emergency loan for one month's fuel for the power plants in Jiangsu to facilitate turnover. Secretary-General Lin Chongyong of the Loan Committee of the National Bank received them. After Speaker Pang and the representatives expressed the severity of the situation, Secretary-General Lin promised to submit it to the Loan Committee for review immediately.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Promises to Allocate 500 Million for Repairs of Damage to City Schools by Garrison Troops: Secretary-General Chen States Funds to Be Issued Within One Month</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since garrison troops have been stationed in some municipal primary and secondary schools in the city, the school buildings and equipment have inevitably suffered some damage. Mayor Wu previously verbally expressed to the principals of various schools that he would allocate temporary funds to subsidize the schools for repairs. Yesterday morning, Municipal Government Secretary-General Chen summoned Education Bureau Chief Secretary Zheng, Secondary Education Section Chief Ye, National Education Section Chief Lu, and principals of municipal primary and secondary schools, Zhou Feicheng, Hu Shuyi, and Long Xia, to discuss the matter. Originally, the reported losses from various schools were very large, exceeding 1 billion yuan. Secretary-General Chen reduced it to 500 million yuan and issued an order to Chief Secretary Zheng, stating: "The following matters should be noted for the repair of school buildings in various municipal vocational primary and secondary schools: (1) The allocation of 500 million yuan for repair expenses should be fair and reasonable. (2) Funds should be issued immediately upon arrival, and repairs should be carried out immediately upon receipt. (3) Each school should mobilize teachers and students for labor service, making one cent worth several cents. (4) Prevent waste, misappropriation, and all kinds of malpractices." Secretary-General Chen also stated that the funds would be issued within one month. Afterwards, the Education Bureau and various schools will discuss the allocation method, with the principle determined as: (1) Municipal vocational middle schools will receive 250 million yuan. (2) Municipal primary schools will receive 250 million yuan. The amount received by each school will depend on the extent of the damage.</p>

<h3>Political Case Cracked in Wuxi and Yixing Counties: Those Arrested Include County Magistrate, Section Chief, Deputy Section Chief, and Others: Related to the "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance" Organization</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Wuxi on the 11th] Recently, a major political case has been cracked here. Those arrested include Fan Taisheng, the first Wuxi County Magistrate after the victory, Zhu Datong, the former Tongshan County Magistrate, Zhang Yifei, the current Social Section Chief of the Wuxi County Government, and Peng Fuzhong, the former Deputy Section Chief of the Wuxi County Land and Food Section, and others. It is said that the case is related to the "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance" organization. The leader is Xu Wentian, the former Director of Education of the Jiangsu Provincial Cadre Training Corps and the current Legislator. Fan and others have now been sent to Zhenjiang for trial.</p>
<p>Authorities Secretly Ordered Escort to Zhenjiang</p>
<p>At 2 a.m. on the 5th of this month, County Magistrate Li Zi suddenly received a secret order from the Provincial Security Headquarters to detain Social Section Chief Zhang Yifei. Li, who also served as the City Defense Commander, immediately summoned Team Leader Guo of the Investigation Team after receiving the order and gave him instructions in person. That afternoon, Guo sent personnel to invite Zhang to the City Defense Department and detained him. On the same morning, Team Leader Guo also personally visited the mansion of former County Magistrate Fan in Houxixi. Fan was out, so Guo rushed to the Xinchang Yarn Company operated by Fan. After meeting, he invited him to have lunch at the City Defense Department. Deputy Commander Li Tiqing then pulled out an arrest warrant and said: "We are old friends, but today there is an official matter that is difficult for my brother." Afterwards, Section Chief Zhang and former County Magistrate Fan were sent to Zhenjiang on the 2 o'clock train.</p>
<p>Three Searches Yielded Documents</p>
<p>Zhang Da, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Police and Security Department, is the person in charge of handling this case. He came to Wuxi at 11 a.m. on the 5th, under the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters. After getting off the train, he went directly to the County Police Bureau and secretly discussed with Director Miao. Then, he issued an order and gathered a large number of patrol officers, patrol sergeants, and criminal police officers to prepare for action. At that time, the atmosphere inside the bureau was extremely tense. The work was not completed until 11 p.m. that night. In addition to Fan and the other four, those arrested included Xu Shaosheng, the younger brother of Xu Wentian, and Huang Keqin (engaged in silk cocoons, recently returned from Xuzhou), Ding Yaping, and others. On the same day, the enforcement personnel searched Section Chief Zhang's residence three times and inspected the residences of other people, reportedly finding many books and other printed materials.</p>
<p>Extensive Involvement: First Crackdown in Yixing</p>
<p>On the 31st of last month, the provincial authorities similarly sent people to Yixing to arrest Zhou Daoxin, a member of the local council and teacher at the Provincial Agricultural School, Wu Chucai, the former Chief Secretary of the Yixing County Government, Zhu Yaohan, the head of general affairs of the Yixing County Bank, and others. After Zhou and others were sent to Zhenjiang, the arrests and searches in Wuxi occurred. There are widespread rumors that Zhang Yifei was transferred to Shanghai for interrogation, but the truth remains to be verified.</p>
<h3>The Battle for the Anqing Bridgehead</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Anqing on the 10th] The commanders in charge of the Anqing campaign are Xia Wei, Commander of the Eighth Pacification Zone, Xu Qiming, Deputy Commander, Zhuge Shu, Chief of Staff, Tan Heyi, Corps Commander, and Wu Zhongjian, the division commander of the defending forces. If we link and extrapolate the names of General Xia Wei and others, we can develop an interesting character analysis that cleverly shows that the National Army has a promising future in the battle of Anqing.</p>
<p>"The might of Xia Yang" has long caused the Communists to fear and be alarmed. This time, the chief of staff of the National Army is a "Mr. Zhuge." He can borrow the east wind and, under "the dawn's light," gradually give people "enlightenment; the future is bright." The Anqing defending forces are the mainstay and will definitely defend firmly." Therefore, the Communists want to seize this bridgehead, and "it is not easy to speak of taking it."</p>
<p>— Episode of the Anqing Campaign—</p>
<p>After the end of the Huaihai Campaign, the Communists' attack target had already indicated Anqing in the Jiangbei bridgehead. Because in terms of terrain, it is the barrier of Nanjing and the left arm of Wuhan. In terms of the situation before the campaign, the defending forces command structure at that time—the Eighth Pacification Zone—was being adjusted and replaced, and it took advantage of the opportunity to descend, hoping to take Anqing in one fell swoop, seize this bridgehead in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and use it as a future crossing point.</p>
<p>The Communist forces facing them have two corps. Its operational boundary is bounded by Baitu Lake, Caizi Lake, Tongcheng Lake, and Zongyang to the north of Anqing. Chen Yi is to the east, and Liu Bocheng is to the west. Liu Bocheng's 15th Corps, with its 43rd and 44th divisions in Taihu and the 45th division in Susong, and the 11th Corps, with its 31st, 32nd, and 33rd divisions, an independent division, the Western Anhui Backbone Brigade, and three backbone regiments, are responsible for the main attack on the front of Anqing. According to military estimates, the Communist forces on the front have 50,000 people. Although they have suffered nearly 20,000 casualties in the fighting in the past ten days, their strength seems to be constantly maintained at this number.</p>
<p>The Anqing defending forces, Wu Zhongjian's troops, were a team that had just been supplemented by a reserve brigade transferred from the rear during the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign. To say that new soldiers who had been trained for less than half a year in Guangxi would immediately assume this difficult task is indeed not easy.</p>
<p>Corps Commander Tan Heyi talked about the 17 days of the Anqing bridgehead defense battle yesterday. He said: "This battle can be divided into three phases at present:"</p>
<p>"The first phase: The battle near Sishilipu and Lion Mountain is a skirmish. At noon on March 21st, a part of the Communist Independent Division of more than 800 people and the main force of the Western Anhui Independent Brigade of more than 2,000 people attacked the National Army guards near Sishilipu and Lion Mountain (both about 20 kilometers north of Anqing). The fighting lasted until the morning of the 22nd. The defending troops, believing that the guard mission had been achieved, gradually withdrew to the first line of resistance near Jixianguan."</p>
<p>"The second phase: Near Jixianguan, on March 22nd, the 31st Division of the Communist 11th Corps and the Independent Division and the Western Anhui Independent Brigade all arrived on the battlefield one after another and launched an attack on the first line of resistance of the National Army at Jixianguan. By the 24th, Jixianguan was lost and regained, forming a seesaw situation. In order to obtain a favorable situation, reduce the front and concentrate forces, and continue to complete the mission, the National Army took the initiative to transfer to the second line of resistance on the night of the 24th and deployed a line that matched the existing forces of the defending army and was ideal for defense. Because the limited forces led by Division Commander Wu Zhongjian were not easy to take on the broad front of the defense and would only increase their own casualties under the other side's tactic of eating the small with the large."</p>
<p>"The third phase: On the line of Qipanshan, Wulidun, and Zhangmuchong on the outskirts of Anqing, which is the second line of resistance in the current stage, the Communist army continued to press forward while the defending army adjusted and occupied the second line of resistance. Its two subsequent divisions of the 11th Corps—the 32nd and 33rd divisions—and three backbone regiments and an artillery regiment also arrived on the 25th to reinforce, and launched a fierce attack on the National Army positions with its several times superiority, especially in the Qipanshan farm area on the eastern outskirts of the city. The battle situation day and night from the 24th to the 4th of April:"</p>
<p>"From the night of the 24th to the night of the 27th, there was fierce fighting on the entire line day and night. The defending army resisted bravely, and the Communist army did not succeed."</p>
<p>"On the 30th, the daytime was slightly calm. After the curtain fell, a fierce attack was launched on the entire line until the night of the 31st. The offensive was still fierce. During that period, the two strongholds of Qipanshan and the farm were once lost, but were quickly recovered by the defending army's counterattack."</p>
<p>"On April 1st, the daytime was calm, and there was an artillery battle at dusk, lasting for two hours. It was followed by a fierce attack on the entire line, with assaults reaching more than ten times, all of which failed."</p>
<p>"On April 4th, the Communist army continued to dig trenches and attacked again, but failed. The National Army launched a powerful attack to the east and occupied Taihu Dam and the line 2,000 meters east of it. In that short day, the attacking Communist army suffered more than 2,000 casualties, and more than 110 people were captured. Its trench warfare tactics were completely shattered."</p>
<p>"The battle for the Anqing bridgehead began on March 21st and lasted for a full 17 days until April 6th. Compared to the 17 days of the Battle of Hengyang, which was famous both at home and abroad during the War of Resistance, and the five days of the wonderful Second Battle of Changsha, it was three to four times more of a hard fight."</p>
<p>"This battle of Anqing can be said to be the most wonderful battle."</p>

<h3>Repairing the Jinwu Light Railway</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Jiang Feng</p>
<p>[Our Jinhua Dispatch, 4th] The Jinwu Railway, this short 50-kilometer route, is a history of blood and tears.</p>
<p>In the early summer of the 31st year (1942), the enemy launched a major offensive on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, attempting to open up the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and realize their dream of a "East Asian Continental Corridor." Jinhua, Wuyi, and other places fell into enemy hands during that offensive. At that time, the enemy learned that Jinhua, Wuyi, and other places were rich in fluorite. They dispatched experts to conduct detailed investigations, believing that the Wuyi fluorite mine had abundant reserves and excellent quality. Therefore, they forcibly recruited laborers to build the Jinwu Light Railway. The people near Jinhua completed the earthwork of the Jinwu Line under the lash. In less than half a year, the Jinwu Railway was opened to traffic amid the painful feelings of the Chinese people. After the opening of the railway, the enemy did everything possible to plunder the Wuyi fluorite until the eve of their defeat. In the spring of the 34th year (1945), when the enemy planned to withdraw from Jinhua, they dismantled the steel rails and bridge materials of the Jinwu Line and transported them elsewhere, leaving only a roadbed, which is now dilapidated.</p>
<p>The products along this route are quite numerous, especially fluorite. It is estimated that 400 tons can be produced daily for up to 50 years. Not long ago, a German geological and metallurgical expert was invited by the American Jiangnan Company to investigate and believed that the Wuyi fluorite was of pure quality and large quantity, and was considered one of the largest fluorite mines in the world. It is estimated that each ton can obtain a net profit of US$7-8, and 5-6,000 tons can be sold each month, which is very economical to export in exchange for foreign exchange. According to reliable investigations, Wuyi County exports more than 80,000 tons of agricultural products, 350,000 tons of bamboo paper and grass paper, and imports about 20,000 tons of cotton textiles each year. It is estimated that the daily freight volume will be 1,300 tons after the restoration of traffic in the future. In addition, coal is produced in the northeastern suburbs of the county, 2 to 5 kilometers from the city, and iron sand is produced in the towns of Censhang, Wuxi, and Qingxi, 20 kilometers from the city, which may also be mined on a large scale in the future.</p>
<p>Because the Jinwu branch line has great economic value, when Shen Chengzhang was in charge of Zhejiang, he had a plan to repair the road as a section of the Hangzhou-Wenzhou Railway. Later, due to the problem of raising road funds and the fact that Shen Chengzhang was transferred to another position, the plan was once shelved. After Chen Gongqia took over from Shen, he announced a major plan to repair the Jinwu Railway, mine Wuyi fluorite in exchange for railway equipment, and build a light rail network in the province. After Chen Ren, Director of the Construction Department, Gong Peicheng, ran around to make contact, it seemed that everything was arranged, and it was originally possible to start construction before the end of last year.</p>
<p>However, not long after, the war situation changed, and the evacuation of Beijing and Shanghai was raised, and the construction of the Jinwu branch line was shelved again. Until recently, Zhou Yan took charge of Zhejiang, and the old matter was brought up again, and a "Light Railway Construction Plan" was drawn up. Under the principle of "seeking its通(tōng - accessibility) first, and then seeking its 備(bèi - completeness)", mountain traffic was developed and minerals were transported. It is planned to sell the fluorite produced in the province to foreign countries, exchange it for foreign exchange to purchase necessary materials, and use civilian labor to repair it.</p>
<p>The implementation procedure has been decided. The following three lines will be built first this year:</p>
<p>(1) The Jin(hua)-Wu(yi) line, 50 kilometers long, is to facilitate the transportation of Wuyi fluorite.</p>
<p>(2) The Shang(jiaodao)-Jin(yun) section of the Jin(hua)-Wen(zhou) line, about 60 kilometers long. Surveying work is now being prepared. Construction can be started after Wuyi fluorite is exchanged for steel rails from foreign countries.</p>
<p>(3) The Yong(bo)-Bai(duan) section of the Hangzhou-Ningbo line can be built after the Japanese steel rails are transported.</p>
<p>From the above plan, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to include the Jinwu Line in the first phase of the construction project, and it is expected that construction will start soon.</p>
<p>As early as when Chen Gongqia was in charge of Zhejiang, the Zhejiang Provincial Light Railway Preparatory Office was established, and Luo Jigang, a senior engineer transferred from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, was appointed as the director of the Preparatory Office. Then, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway also established the Jinwu Branch Line Preparatory Office in Jinhua on New Year's Day this year, and Luo Jigang was still appointed as the director, and Chen Changyan was additionally appointed as the senior engineer and deputy director to actively prepare for the start of construction.</p>
<p>On January 22 this year, Director Luo and Zeng Ziwei, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, came to Jinhua to convene a symposium of the county magistrates and public representatives of Jinhua, Wuyi, Lanxi, Tangxi, Suichang, Longyou, and Qu County to discuss the construction of the Jinwu Line. It was decided on the spot that the counties along the Jinwu Line would be responsible for requisitioning 35,000 insufficient sleepers. The market price of each sleeper was equivalent to 24 catties of Zhongbai rice. The province would bear half of the cost, and the counties present would jointly bear half of the cost. The number of sleepers purchased by each county would be determined by the province based on the tax quota and business tax amount of each county, and it was stipulated that all of them should be requisitioned within March.</p>
<p>In addition to the smooth resolution of the sleeper problem, the three large bridges along the line, namely the Jinhua River, which is 160 meters long, the Baxian River, which is 130 meters long, and the Baiyang River, which is 160 meters long, have a total length of 550 meters across the area. The bridge steel beams required for the project were requested by the Preparatory Office to be transferred from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) materials allocated to the Jinpu Railway and still stored in the Zhanghuabang Bridge Yard in Shanghai, and it is said that there is no problem in principle. In addition, locomotives have been planned to be purchased by Tang Enbo, and passenger and freight vehicles have been allocated by the Ministry of Communications. It has been decided to borrow the existing steel rails stored in Shanghai on the Huainan Road, and it is possible that all of them will be transported here for use within a month.</p>
<p>The surveying team dispatched for the 1/2000 scale plan and the 1/4000 scale longitudinal profile started work on the 18th of last month and will be able to survey to the suburbs of Wuyi today. When this reporter visited the Wuyi fluorite mine, I saw staff responsible for surveying working in the rain on the way. It has been raining heavily for the past half month, but the more than 20 staff members are working in extremely difficult conditions and may complete the task in a very short time. Their good working morale is truly admirable in today's situation.</p>
<p>From all aspects, the preparatory work for the restoration project of the Jinwu Light Railway has been largely completed, and it has entered the state of "everything is ready, only欠(qiàn - lacking)東風(dōngfēng - east wind)". The people along the Jinwu Line are looking forward to the government authorities quickly allocating the funds for the project as the "east wind", so that this Jinwu Line, which has been paid for by the people with blood and enslaved by the enemy, can become an artery serving the people and promoting the rural economy as soon as possible. The reporter wishes it an early resurrection!</p>

<p>From the above investigation data, it can be seen that Wuyi's ore reserves are vast and abundant. Therefore, during the enemy's operation, a large-scale fluorite smelting plant covering an area of 35 mu was built outside the south gate of Wuyi, all made of steel and cement, with facilities such as a water storage pool and a water tower, and there was a hydroelectric power plant nearby. In the mining areas such as Jiang Wan Dong, more than 40 worker residences and a small power plant were built. There are light rail networks in each mine. This reporter made a special trip to visit the Wuyi mining area. Except for the bridge steel rails and sleepers of the Jinwu Light Railway, which were dismantled and transported away by the enemy before the victory, the mining areas that only left the roadbed earthwork were also mostly damaged, and the mining tunnels were covered by collapsed waste rocks; the worker residences were also dilapidated. The fluorite smelting plant in the south of the city only has a large chimney standing tall into the clouds, sighing to the long sky, for people to commemorate.</p>
<p>Three years after the victory, time has passed in the civil war. The enemy left behind a roughly scaled mine, but there was no time and no ability to recover it, and it was allowed to be buried, which is truly regrettable. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has repeatedly advocated restoring the Jinwu Railway, reopening Wuyi fluorite, and prohibiting private mining and transportation; however, the government has been planning for a long time and has not yet reached the implementation stage. Therefore, private scattered miners have all stopped work due to an order prohibiting external transportation. After this reporter visited the mining area, I felt that Wuyi's fluorite is not only of good quality and large quantity, but also has convenient transportation, and it is urgent to recover it. Here, I sincerely hope that the government authorities will quickly lay the Jinwu Railway, and the government and businesses will jointly establish a mining company to purchase machinery and engage in large-scale mining. This is not only related to the prosperity and decline of the rural economy in central Zhejiang, but also to the national economy and people's livelihood.</p>

<h3>The Process of Xue Daxiong, a Student of the Chinese Department of Chongqing University, Discovering the Han Tomb</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Chongqing, 9th] An ancient Han tomb was discovered this morning near the Nongzhuang, the dormitory of the faculty and staff of Chongqing University. It has been confirmed by Professor Qin Fengxiang and Shao Zuping of the Chinese Department. The discovery of the ancient tomb was extremely accidental. Xue Daxiong, a student of the Chinese Department of Chongqing University, is originally from Wujin, Jiangsu. Recently, because an ancient tomb was discovered in his hometown, and someone sent a letter to inform him of the patterns of the Han bricks unearthed, this curious student had a flash of inspiration. He cleverly said that Han bricks had also been discovered near Chongqing University. Sure enough, this morning, he dug up fragments of pottery of bodhisattvas, leopards, dragons, provinces, cups and plates in the Nongzhuang. In addition, he also discovered Han bricks of 4.5 inches in length and width, and 8 inches in height. There were burr-shaped patterns on both sides of the bricks, which were the same as the patterns of the Han bricks sent from Wujin. This matter has caused a sensation in Shapingba. Xue Daxiong is consulting with Yuan Shifu, the director of the Chinese Department, to preside over the excavation of the Han tomb in the future.</p>
<h3>Speculation on the Flour Market in Changzhou Three Companies Embarrassed by Squeeze</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Wujin, 11th] On Friday and Saturday of last week, the price of goods soared, and speculators repeatedly pushed up the price, causing unprecedented chaos in the market. In the flour market, Pingqi, who was accustomed to shorting, Zhenfeng Flour Shop, Zhang Jingwen, Hengfeng Shop, nicknamed Little Wang, and Wang Afang and others, shorted more than 5,000 bags of flour, taking away more than 600 million yuan in cash. Later, when their colleagues squeezed them for cash, they were unable to cope and all avoided the exchange and disappeared. On one hand, they tried to ask for a bankruptcy. On the 10th, the flour market stopped auctioning. The county government specially ordered the person in charge of the association to not open the auction before the floating amount was smoothed out, so as to avoid causing chaos.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Dragon Well Tea Region</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Chuyu Sheng</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 10th of This Month] The Dragon Well tea leaves, famous both at home and abroad, are primarily produced in the scenic areas of Hangzhou: Lion Peak, Dragon Well, Yunqi, and Hupao. Among them, Lion Peak's production is considered the best, followed by Dragon Well, and then the others. Lion Peak is a high mountain next to Dragon Well and can be said to be part of the Dragon Well area, hence the tea is named after Dragon Well.</p>
<p>There are two routes to Dragon Well. One is via the Nine Creeks and Eighteen Streams, and the other is from Jingjiang Road in the North Mountain to the "Twin Peaks Piercing the Clouds" monument, turning left into a small path. This small path is also accessible by car, leading directly to the foot of Dragon Well Mountain. The Nine Creeks and Eighteen Streams, as well as the mountains near Dragon Well, are mostly barren hills, except for the vicinity of Dragon Well Temple, which still retains many ancient trees, resembling a peacock with its tail spread, proudly showing off to the surrounding mountains.</p>
<p>Climbing Dragon Well Mountain, winding stone steps are naturally arranged with clumps of green leaves and forests. There is also a pool of moderate size, with ancient vines winding around it. Gradually ascending, one reaches Dragon Well Temple. In the tea pavilion of Dragon Well Temple, one can overlook West Lake. Entering a rockery cave, there is a Dragon Well. Originally, this well is a mountain spring. After a fresh rain, a dividing line can be seen on the water surface. Even if stirred with a stick, it still exists. It is said that the mountain spring originally contains minerals, and the rainwater, after falling, cannot mix with the mountain spring, thus forming two halves. Once the rainwater flows away, the dividing line disappears.</p>
<p>The Shunzhi and Qianlong Emperors of the Qing Dynasty visited this place several times, staying for a day or two before returning to the city. This place is indeed peaceful and tranquil, perfect for escaping the summer heat, and is the most elegant area in the South Mountain. In the past, Hu Shih also came here and, seeing many ancient stone tablets used as paving stones, wrote an article regretting this. Now, some of them have been recovered by the temple monks, such as the well railing of Dragon Well. The rest have disappeared.</p>
<p>Walking a few hundred steps from Dragon Well Temple, a bamboo forest leads to Dragon Well Village. All 104 households in the village are engaged in tea cultivation. This village is built next to the Nine Creeks, and a small stream flows through the village into the Eighteen Streams. The houses near the water have small stone bridges, and inside each house, there is a stove for frying tea. In the open space in front of the houses, chickens and ducks are raised in flocks, but it is very clean. The villagers are neatly dressed, with clean faces, resembling a secluded paradise.</p>
<p>The surrounding mountains are planted with short tea bushes, and the towering Lion Peak looks as if the tea trees are planted like a chessboard.</p>
<p>I, as a reporter, have been in Hangzhou for almost three years, and have visited various scenic spots. However, the scenery around Dragon Well is the most superior. Whenever people come to Hangzhou to visit, I always recommend it as a good place to go. In the spring of 1947, Tian Han, Ying Yunwei, and Wu Tian came to Hangzhou and were inspired here to write the screenplay for the film "Remembering Jiangnan."</p>
<p>During the Qingming Festival, Dragon Well takes on a fresh new look. Men and women picking tea, carrying baskets on their backs, climb the tea mountains, picking tender tea buds. In Dragon Well Village, every household opens its doors, placing tables and chairs, with white tablecloths on the tables, displaying glass bottles containing tea leaves and several teacups. On the door, there is a sign that reads "This Household Sells Dragon Well Bud Tea," so that tourists can purchase it after enjoying the fine tea.</p>
<p>According to Yongchang, the abbot of Dragon Well Temple, Dragon Well has had tea for a long time. During the Song Dynasty, Su Dongpo often came to the temple (then named "Guangfu") and enjoyed tea and conversation with the old abbot Biancai. When Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty came to the temple, the villagers presented tea leaves to him. He praised it as a fine product and visited the area, where he saw eighteen tea trees, hence the saying "Eighteen Imperial Tea Trees." Before the war, Hu Shih, while serving as the envoy to the United States, annually entrusted a Mr. Cheng from Shanghai to purchase ten catties of Dragon Well tea from the temple for President Roosevelt. As a result, more and more foreigners came to buy it. I have visited tea farmers and learned that a mu of tea trees can produce forty to fifty catties of good tea, or one dan of lower quality tea. The tea fields also need to be fertilized and weeded, using fertilizers such as manure and rapeseed cake. During the Anti-Japanese War, because there was no fertilizer, many tea trees became old, so the recent production has decreased compared to before the war. Tea trees are best planted on mountains, especially sandy mountains. The areas near Lion Peak and Centipede Temple are the best because they are white sandy mountains. The eighteen imperial tea trees are located there.</p>
<p>After the tea leaves are picked, they must be stir-fried by hand, with a slow fire and a quick, hot fire under the stove. Stir-frying must be done several times to be considered successful. After stir-frying, some people also blend old tea, saying that blending with old tea enhances the aroma. This year, the monthly cost for providing food and lodging to stir-fryers is five dan of rice. The cost for pickers is about five hundred yuan per tael. Based on cost calculations, the selling price of pre-Qingming tea is about one dan of rice per catty. Last year, there were many tourists, and the production of Dragon Well tea, about five to six thousand dan, was not enough to sell. Some tea merchants used tea leaves from Lin'an, Yuhang, Shaoxing, and other places to replace Dragon Well tea for sale. Although the tea business in Dragon Well Village is very good, the atmosphere in Dragon Well Village is so tranquil and comfortable, most of the families in the village are poor because they lack capital during the tea-picking season and have to borrow from tea merchants. When the tea is produced, one catty is used to settle the debt for one catty. When the tea price is high, they cannot enjoy the profit and are busy for nothing. As for wanting to improve the tea fields and plant new tea, it is out of the question.</p>
<p>I always imagine that such famous Dragon Well tea should be further improved, such as maintaining its color, aroma, and taste permanently. However, because the tea-growing families are too busy taking care of their livelihoods, many agricultural experts with ambition have not yet turned their attention to Dragon Well tea.</p>
<p>This year, with the flames of war approaching, Dragon Well tea has suffered another blow!</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Arbitrage Transactions Sprout Up Like Bamboo Shoots After Rain; Silver Dollars Rise, Gold Notes Fade</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday's silver dollar arbitrage was particularly active due to the upcoming tea season. It is reported that more than ten firms arbitrated out large quantities of silver dollars for remittance, with the remittance rate rising to five yuan (an increase of 105 yuan for every 100 yuan). Some were done on a five-day term, with the counterparty paying cash, while others were done with drafts, with payment in two days. Most of these remittances were transferred to Tunxi, Wuyuan, and other places. Although the Hunanese firms arbitrated out sporadic remittances, totaling about 50,000 yuan, the exchange rate was an increase of two yuan per 100 yuan. Arbitrage in Wanxian saw an increase of one yuan per 100 yuan, with some done directly, possibly due to the high price of silver dollars in Wanxian. Hankou firms had silver dollar funds coming in, but no outgoing arbitrage was reported. Shanghai mostly used draft remittances, with payment three days after sight, and payment in gold yuan for delays of one day, but the amounts were small. Conversely, gold yuan being arbitraged in was quite common.</p>
<p>Nanchang rice firms arbitrated out a large amount of silver dollars, with an increase of one to three yuan per 100 yuan. In Peiping yesterday, it was heard that a certain large building Shen Zhuang firm arbitrated out 500 US dollars, with the remittance rate done directly. In Fuzhou, silver dollar arbitrage was done by the southern goods firms, with an exchange rate of 15 yuan per 100 yuan. It is difficult to accurately calculate the above statistics due to the scattered amounts, and each firm's arbitrage is in violation of the law, making it difficult to investigate the underlying reasons without special connections.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a Tianjin merchant told our reporter that the number of silver dollars arbitrated out by northern firms will continue to grow. It is heard that a certain influential person is planning to purchase a large quantity of Yuan heads (silver dollars) in Shanghai and Hangzhou and transport them to Tunxi for arbitrage remittance business. However, mountain villages price raw tea in silver dollars, making "Tianjin-Shanghai" and "Shanghai-Tunxi" silver dollar arbitrage a great business opportunity recently.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, silver dollars once again showed their strength, having already surpassed gold and US dollars. The stock exchange, with its dealmaking firms, opened with one tael of gold exchanging for 48 big heads (silver dollars), and one tael of gold going out for 50 big heads. Trading then narrowed to 47-49, 46-48, and finally closed in the afternoon at 47-49. The afternoon saw a decline to 46-48, with closing at 45-47.</p>
<p>Small heads (silver dollars) remained stable, trading at 60-65. Dragon dollars fell steadily from 90-95 to 88-93, and then down to 87-92 in the afternoon. The ratio of big heads to small heads remained stable at 80 to 100, and the ratio of big heads to dragon and eagle dollars also remained at 60 to 100.

<h3>National Bank Continued Selling Gold Yesterday; Off-Exchange Prices Briefly Surpassed 4 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, after the Central Bank sold gold off-exchange at a price of 3.6 million yuan, and seeing that the market had little appetite, it, with lightning speed, around 10 o'clock, entrusted Dadecheng Gold Firm to sell unlimited amounts at the black market price of 3.6 million in the market, reducing prices all the way to 3.45 million, for a total of 11,976 bars.</p>
<p>According to the regulations, the allowed daily increase was 3,284,000, but the Central Bank broke the limit and sold gold at a high black market price, which was not in line with the regulations. According to the regulations on the buying and selling of gold, issued by the Ministry of Finance, the limit for increases and decreases is 20%. The Central Bank did not submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for amendments before implementation, which surprised all the gold firms. There were no transactions in the afternoon due to the scarcity of people.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Off-exchange spot trading opened at 3.35 million-3.45 million due to heavy pressure from the Central Bank.

<p>In the afternoon, next-day trading opened at 3.75 million-3.85 million. Due to active selling from Northern and Shanxi firms, prices briefly exceeded 4 million, reaching as high as 4.1 million-4.2 million.</p>

<h3>Market Money Tight</h3>
<p>The market money market was already seen to be tight yesterday morning. Because the prices of various goods in the market had already successively surged to a peak, interbank lending also followed, with the lowest price for daily lending at 60 yuan per thousand yuan, and the highest at 150 yuan. After the Central Bank sold gold off-exchange the day before, market money initially loosened and then tightened. Although people in various industries felt that prices had reached their peak, the foundation was unstable. The Central Bank may sell a large amount of gold within the day, and prices will fall back. Yesterday morning, market prices mostly hovered on a firm path and did not create new records. The interest on goods for each industry was 60-65 yuan for securities, 100 yuan for yarn, 110 yuan for rayon factories, 90-100 yuan for silk, 150 yuan for sugar, and 110 yuan for daily necessities cigarettes.</p>

<h3>Dragon Well Firmly Navigates the Market</h3>
<p>This year's Hangzhou "Before the Rain" new Dragon Well tea is expected to be shipped to Shanghai this week to meet market demand. According to industry insiders, although the region is blessed by nature, making its products better than those of Wenzhou, Zhejiang, the tea body is not as fresh and tender as in previous years due to the erratic rainfall this year. Tea farmers and merchants generally expressed dissatisfaction with this. As for the new Dragon Well from Wenzhou, the source continues unabated, but the quality is aging day by day. Price cuts among industry peers are intended to benefit downstream customers, but since non-industry materials and freight rates are cyclically rising, costs are repeatedly increasing, so they are still struggling in their original paths. For other varieties, although market money is tighter than before, sentiment is not discouraged, and they continue to firmly navigate the market.</p>
<h3>Situation Improves Day by Day; Chinese Stocks Rise Again</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Chinese stock market continued its upward trend yesterday, carrying on the momentum from the previous night. In the past, the market had lagged for a long time due to constraints from the situation and threats from the external environment. Recently, with the overall situation easing, the public is paying attention. Although the market money trend was slightly tighter yesterday, the supply of funds was still smooth, and bullish sentiment spread across the board, leading to a firm market and ultimately a rise.</p>
<p>Yongsha opened in the morning at 36.5 yuan. Due to consecutive days of gains and tight market money, overnight bulls frequently liquidated, softening the market slightly and falling to 35.5-35.8 yuan, the lowest price after opening. Swiftly replenishing short positions and squeezing spot chips, sentiment suddenly lifted, with various firms frequently absorbing, rising to 40.07 yuan. Subsequently, news of falling gold prices and pressure from the Central Bank caused institutions to sell at high prices, and the market suddenly fell, hovering around 39.8-39.9 yuan. Later, hearing that the Yongsha interest payment was 60-65 yuan, major players strongly supported the market, rising to 41.3 yuan. Retail investors competed to sell, and the market closed at 39.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks opened weak in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon. Xinhe rose from 8.3 yuan to the 9.5 yuan limit, and Xinguang was quiet in the previous market but soared to 3.11 yuan to the limit near closing. Qinxing Jingfu first leveled and then rose.

The morning opened with buying at 1.35 million, rising all the way to 1.53 million. Subsequently, hearing that gold prices were soft, buyers were cautious, and market prices also softened, before rising again near closing, ultimately closing at the 1,584,000 yuan limit.</p>
<p>The after-market initially traded with buying at 1.55 million, rising to 1,584,000 yuan, squeezing up 264,000 yuan, with 37 taels traded.</p>

<h3>Tight Funds, High Shadow Interest; Rice Prices Slightly Decline, White Rice Closing at 400,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The rice market was weak yesterday, due to the excessive gains the previous day, tight funds in the market, and high shadow interest. Many holders sought to sell at the opening, and prices for all grades of goods fell by 30,000-50,000 yuan. Later, gold prices rose, and various parties absorbed at low prices, stopping the decline and rebounding. White rice closed at 400,000, with next-day payments at 420,000 yuan, a fall of 10,000 yuan from the previous day.

<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market was firmly stable. From the beginning of the market to before closing, due to tight funds, falling rice prices, and fragile sentiment, buyers were mostly cautious, fearing large sales by the Central Bank, and the market remained in a sluggish path. Until the closing, there was no news of sales by the Central Bank, and market buying quickly became strong, and the market rose. Lao Che called for 146,000 yuan, and Bingchuan was last traded at 143,500 yuan, a slight increase of 2,000 yuan from yesterday.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Prices fell across the board, but red grain was scarce, and the market could not meet demand. The market was unique in rising amid the decline of all goods and hit the 200,000 mark. Soybeans were weakening step by step, corn fell by 10,000 yuan, sesame trading was strong, and raw kernels did not trade.</p>
<h3>Market Ramblings</h3>
<p>— By a Spectator</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Arbitrage Trading Intensifies Extraction of Blood from Rural Areas</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Brands of Silver Dollars Complain; Seems Like an Anti-Yuan Movement</p>
<p>Many banks and firms are rushing to engage in silver dollar arbitrage.</p>
<p>Once this trend starts, silver dollars from all over the country will be swallowed up by Shanghai, which has the greatest capacity.</p>
<p>Since the nationalization of silver in the winter of 1935, most of the silver in major cities has been converted to paper money. Only rural areas, which are highly conservative, may have a habit of hoarding silver.</p>
<p>The silver dollars circulating in the market now are probably mostly from rural areas. After silver dollar arbitrage, the speed at which silver dollars flow from various regions to Shanghai will inevitably increase.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this is the work of urban capital extracting blood from the vast rural areas.</p>
<p>Optimistic air such as "Peace Talks" and "Ceasefire" is very strong, reflected in the market, stocks rose wildly and then rose more wildly, and the general commodity market tended to be weak.</p>
<p>People need peace and also need to alleviate the high price pressure. With the success of peace, the price pressure will also be lifted. Just the optimistic air has entered the market, and the market has already changed. This shows that</p>
<p>But before the facts are actually realized, one should not "take chicken feathers as imperial arrows." Currently, it is still hot and cold, and one must be careful when entering and exiting the market.</p>
<p>With the upcoming mid-month salary payment, the rise of silver dollars is becoming more and more popular.</p>
<p>The pride of the Yuan Datou era; sailing ships, Sun Yat-sen heads, eagle dollars, dragon dollars, etc., are far behind. In terms of fineness and weight, they should not be so far apart, and many people complain for Sun Yat-sen heads, etc.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no need to complain. As long as you have a sense of what is already available, "People despise it, so I buy. People value it, so I abandon," is the main secret of the Jews. One day, when the "Look Alike Order" arrives, grievances can also be resolved.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors in the market that the Central Bank will recoin Yuan heads. The Central Bank's denial is of course the fact, but such news will not disappear and may even be intensified in the future.</p>
<p>You should know that this is the beginning of the "Anti-Yuan Movement." Since someone launched it, there will be a day of success.</p>
<p>Similarly, Citibank has recently faded in obscurity.</p>
<p>At the time of 8/19, exchanging one US dollar for two silver dollars was already abuse. Now, one-to-one is even more abuse.</p>
<p>I don't think there is any need to complain, as long as you have a good idea of where the high profits come from, there will always be seeds left in the unfeeling times.</p>
<p>Please be very careful. American and British merchants of Jewish descent who can use their brains have one thing. There is a possibility that "Yuan Datou" imported goods will be listed and sell off US dollars.</p>
<p>The gold market has entered a new stage; that is, the daily limit increase. Only with the daily limit increase can the off-exchange price stand firm.</p>
<p>Slightly sell off-exchange overnight, and then buy back the next morning. Slightly supply for sale again in the afternoon, and then replenish again the next morning. By doing so, you earn interest and earn the price, and it is insured.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Retreats</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was stable and weak. The reprinting industry was saturated and turned to wait-and-see attitude. In addition, the money report was tight, and the daily deduction was as high as 1.2 yuan. The customer gang also stopped entering the market, but the holders still rarely took off their hands, so there were not many transactions in the market.</p>
<p>42-strand Blue Phoenix initially opened at 25.5 million yuan, and at one point progressed to 28.5 million yuan. At closing, it resumed to the downstream trend, ending at 26 million yuan, down 1 million yuan from the previous one.</p>
<p>32-strand Silver Moon slightly fell by 100,000 yuan, ending at 16.1 million yuan.</p>
<p>21-strand Double Horse spot goods started at 12.7 million yuan, once hitting 13 million yuan, and closed at 12.3 million yuan, slightly down 400,000 yuan. Factory orders are still 100,000 yuan away from spot goods. 20-strand Double Horse was 800,000 yuan lower, and other grades were also slightly smaller, but 10-strand Boy Scouts and Siping Lian revealed their color.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market Crushes</h3>
<p>The cloth market started low and continued yesterday. The money trend turned tight, and there were excessive leaps and bounds in recent days. People had some concerns. At the beginning of the morning, all parties took a wait-and-see attitude, and both buying and selling were sparse. Afterwards, the merchants on this street took in at low prices, and the market was slightly firm. The result was that the market still saw a crush compared with the after-market of the previous day.</p>
<p>Longtou Fine Cloth was pulled from 435,000 yuan to the highest level of 455,000 yuan. Near noon, it was once as low as 430,000 yuan. At noon, it closed at 443,000 yuan, a drop of 22,000 yuan. Sijunzi Biji broke through the 1 million yuan mark at the high end of the Silin factory. The buying was strong in the after-market, because the non-industry was all thriving. The initial Longtou Fine Cloth opened at 471,000 yuan, and Sijunzi Biji at 460,000 yuan. At the end, the former closed at 485,000 yuan and the latter at 474,000 yuan, an increase of 42,000 yuan to 46,000 yuan compared with the noon closing.</p>
<h3>Silk Saw Gains and Losses; Rayon Small Blanket Rose</h3>
<p>The opening of excellent grade raw silk yesterday morning was 21 million yuan, and the noon closing was still 21 million, which was on par with the previous market, with few gains and losses.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the opening of rayon for spot delivery, Tianqiao and Siniya, was 12.5 million yuan. In the noon closing, the clear bill transaction rose to 13.5 million yuan, which was 3 million yuan less than the noon closing yesterday, due to the fragile sentiment of the people.</p>
<p>The Huaqiang Blanket of Silk, opened in the morning at 8.4 million yuan, and rose to 8.75 million yuan at noon closing, an increase of 128,400 yuan from the previous noon closing, and all have been upgraded by Xu Chengyun.</p>

<h3>Things to Know About Table Tennis</h3>
<p>The following is a discussion about the use of the feet:</p>
<p>(1) Support weight with the front of the foot: Putting the body's center of gravity on the front of the foot can make the body light and agile. With agile movement, one can make sharp attacks. If the center of gravity is always on the heel, the body cannot be used freely, and the fighting spirit will inevitably be diminished. At this point, one only has the ability to defend against attacks.</p>
<p>(2) Bend the knees to lean the body slightly forward: Bending the knees can make the body lean forward, shifting the center of gravity forward. In this way, the whole body is like a spring, and can cope freely in any direction. This is of great benefit for both forehand and backhand shots.</p>
<p>(3) The two feet should form an oblique line: When preparing to play, there are two theories about the position of the feet: one is the parallel theory, which keeps the feet parallel to the table tennis net; the other is the oblique line theory, which maintains a certain angle between the line connecting the two feet and the extension line of the net. When the feet are parallel, lateral movement is relatively easy, but there is a lack of convenience for forward and backward movement. Therefore, usually the feet maintain an angle of twenty degrees with the net.</p>
<p>(7) The Three Stages of Playing Table Tennis</p>
<p>Practicing table tennis can be divided into three stages: the first stage is the beginner stage; the second stage is the training stage; and the third stage is the skilled stage.</p>
<p>During the learning stage, one must concentrate all of one's attention on one point of the ball, because the position where the ball bounces on the table, the ball speed, the ball's rotation speed, and the ball's direction of rotation can be understood after the ball hits the table. At the same time, pay attention to hitting the ball in the middle of the paddle when returning the ball. Hitting the ball in the middle of the paddle is very difficult, but the rebounding force of the middle of the paddle is the strongest, and various playing methods can also be accurate. The rebounding force of the four sides of the paddle is reduced, and there is little confidence in using various paddle methods. Therefore, in the beginner stage, one must pay close attention to the ball, and at the same time, pay attention to hitting the returned ball in the middle of the paddle.</p>
<p>During this stage, it is not advisable to imitate skilled table tennis players and hit hard balls indiscriminately. Pay attention to not touching the net and not going out of the table, fully restrain the ball, and hit the ball within one foot of the baseline. Also, first practice hitting the ball well in front of one's body with the hand holding the paddle, and then practice hitting the ball by pulling the hand holding the paddle backwards. Only after these two hitting methods are learned can one practice sideways hitting.</p>
<p>After each return of the ball, one must always be prepared to return the next ball, because only by being prepared at all times can one cope at any time, otherwise one will be subjected to unexpected attacks and be at a loss.</p>
<p>Only after one can hit the ball almost every time in the middle of the paddle and hit the opponent's table almost every time can one be considered to have completed the first stage of the course.</p>
<p>During the training stage, one should pay attention to correcting one's weaknesses, and practice various hitting methods. Having fewer hitting methods means having more flaws and more opportunities for the opponent to attack. One must also learn to conserve physical strength, attacking only where one should attack, and defending where one should defend. Do not move rashly when not defending, and respond quickly, in order to fight for a long time.</p>
<p>In addition to this, one must also pay attention to the opponent's movements, because understanding the opponent's movements can predict the direction of the opponent's return. The observation methods are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>1. The posture of the wrist, paddle, and body before and during hitting the ball;</p>
<p>2. The position of oneself and the opponent, and the hitting posture;</p>
<p>3. The position of the opponent and the table tennis net;</p>
<p>4. The position of the paddle;</p>
<p>5. Research on the opponent's habits and common tactics.</p>
<p>Being able to pay attention to the above points makes it not difficult to predict what kind of ball the opponent will hit.</p>
<p>During this stage, one must not only correct one's weaknesses, practice various hitting methods, and pay attention to the opponent's movements, but also train one's hands and feet. Training one's hands is the most important thing, but it will not be successful if the feet do not actively help when hitting the ball. To cope with the opponent's attacks, one must have a flexible response. This kind of all-around skill relies on the movement of the feet.</p>
<p>By the skilled stage, one should have a thorough understanding of the principles of playing table tennis, and play the ball very well. One should also be used to seeing the opponent's usual movements. Therefore, table tennis players in this period are limited to ordinary viewing, and should do more observation before the battle, making final corrections to one's own return.</p>
<h3>Softball League to Open on May 1st: Grand Scale and Unprecedented Excitement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Paomao County Softball League will open on May 1st. This year's league will see all of Shanghai's top teams participating, making it a grand event unseen since the end of the war. In previous years, the competition was divided into two units: military and civilian, organized separately by the U.S. Navy Sports Department and the International Sports Association. This year, a flexible approach has been adopted, with the two organizations jointly hosting the event. Bringing together elite troops from both sides in one league, the grand competition that will unfold can be imagined.</p>
<p>Among the Chinese teams, only the reigning champion Panda team has formally registered to join so far. The Bee team, mainly composed of athletes from St. John's University, has not yet made a move. The registration deadline was originally set for this Friday, but to facilitate the registration procedures for other teams that did not participate in the previous competition, the organizing committee has decided to extend it to next Monday (the 18th). Chinese military teams interested in competing with foreigners can contact the International Sports Association in Paomao or Mr. Kelibote, one of the league organizers.</p>
<p>The teams that have already registered include ten units: Panda, Wild Duck, Texaco, Country Club, Holy Riders, Portuguese Business, and the U.S. military's Weather, Aviation, Harbor, and Officers teams. Teams that have been notified but have not completed registration include West Blue, Catholic League, Civil Aviation Brigade, Aurora University, Filipino Musicians Association, and the American Academy.</p>
<p>It is expected that more than 30 teams will participate in this year's competition, so it is possible that they will be divided into groups based on their strength.</p>
<p>To ensure the smooth progress of this grand league, the organizing committee will hold a meeting of representatives from all participating teams next Monday in Paomao to discuss the various details of the league. It has also been decided to open all the ballparks in Paomao from today onwards to allow the teams to practice. According to the announcement from the authorities: Teams that have already registered and wish to use the field can contact Mr. Cox by phone. The phone numbers are 30056 and 37437.</p>

<h3>4th Table Tennis League: Post Office Meets Bank of China Today</h3>
<p>The 4th Shanghai Table Tennis League has already started mobilizing the second division teams since last night. Apart from the Jingzong and Wangye locations, other venues such as Shanbao, Yousi, and Xinyi, although not spacious, were crowded with fans, and the venue managers were unable to accommodate everyone. This shows that table tennis has aroused the interest of people from all walks of life, which is the result of the enthusiastic promotion by the organizing committee.</p>
<p>Starting at 7:00 PM tonight (the 13th), there will be six more matches, including one first division match and five second division matches, held in five ballrooms including the Post Office and Guohuo. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Bank of China vs. Post Office (First Division) 7:00 PM Post Office</p>

<h3>Army Armored Team Slightly Wins Over Pele</h3>
<p>The Army Armored Headquarters basketball team played against Pele at the team's stadium on Dianlu Road yesterday at 5:30 PM. The referee was Wu Zibin. The strengths of both sides were almost equal, and the match was very close. The first half ended in a tie at 11. After switching sides, the scores were very close, and it was difficult to tell who would win. The Army Armored team finally won slightly by a score of 38 to 35, with a difference of one and a half goals, because they were more familiar with the venue.</p>
<h3>4th University Games Changed to be Held in Nanshi</h3>
<p>The 4th University Games held its third preparatory meeting last Saturday, and it was resolved that: (1) The games were originally scheduled to be held at Shanghai University on April 30th, but because the school is located in Pudong and transportation is inconvenient, and the budget is quite large, in order to save on the cost of the games, it was changed to be held at the Nanshi Stadium, which has been approved. The date remains the same. (2) The registration fee and expenses were originally set at one stone and five dou of rice for each participating school. In order to reduce the burden on each school, it was changed to one stone. The insufficient amount will still be prepared by Shanghai University. (3) Registration will still be done at the Shanggongyuan at 209 Yuanmingyuan Road. When registering, in addition to submitting the registration list, please also pay one stone of the current market price of Shangbai Geng rice on that day (Langqi checks must be paid before 11:00 AM). (4) The venue equipment group should send a letter to the Nanshi Stadium to take on the responsibility.</p>
<p>The preparatory committee has already sent the report name list to each school. If you have not received it, you can send a letter to the preparatory office of Shanghai University to request it.</p>
<h3>Lawn Tennis Match: Hong Kong Defeats Saigon Again</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Air News] After completing their matches in France, the Saigon tennis players passed through Hong Kong on their way back to Vietnam. The Hong Kong Tennis Association contacted them and held a friendly match with the Vietnamese team. The friendly match was held on grass and hard courts. The hard court tennis match was held the previous weekend, and Hong Kong won by 3-2, with Lai Yekuan winning both singles matches and Ye Guanxiong and Xu Weipei winning one doubles match. The grass court match continued last weekend, and Hong Kong won again by 4-1. The results of the five matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Ye Guanxiong 6-4 8-6 Arong</p>
<p>Wen Sui 3-6 6-3 6-3 Xu Weipei</p>
<p>Ye Guanxiong 1-6 6-3 6-0 Wen Sui</p>
<p>Ye Guanxiong Cai Huiquan 5-7 6-4 6-4 Wen Sui Arong</p>
<p>Note that Cai Huiquan is our country's Taiwan Cup player. He recently returned from Singapore. This time, he partnered with Ye Guanxiong in doubles. Because Cai had not played a match in six months, he was a little rusty and often made mistakes. Although he led 5-3 in the first set, he was overtaken by the Vietnamese general. After the start of the second set, Ye Guanxiong worked hard and Cai also improved, and they won.</p>
<p>Overall, Ye Guanxiong's performance in several matches in this friendly match has been highly praised, and he is considered to be a promising figure in the future. It is a pity that this French general did not overcome Kleigang, and was unable to compete with Ye Guanxiong.</p>
<h3>Brown Victor Reigns in Australia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Melbourne, 11th] Veteran Brown Victor was today listed by the Australian Lawn Tennis Association as the top player in Australian tennis. In the women's Hall of Fame, Mrs. Bolton is in the top spot.</p>
<h3>China Airlines Team Returns to Shanghai: Two Victories in Qingdao</h3>
<p>The China Aviation football team was invited by the Qingdao sports community to exchange football skills. A group of 15 people, led by Lu Weisen and Wu Shouwei, flew to Qingdao last Saturday for two matches. In the first match, they defeated the Zhongqing team, the champion of North China and the Northeast. (2-0) In the second match against the Qingdao United team, the audience was extremely crowded. The situation was as grand as the East China Qingdao situation in Shanghai. There were many spectators who were rejected outside the door. In addition to the original team from Zhongqing, the United team also gained assistance from famous Tianjin business team players Grace and Qiu Pulopov, as well as Shen Shuxuan, a good player from the Seoul team. In the battle, the China Aviation's Shanghai style won with a record of 5-1. The entire team returned to Shanghai by plane on the 11th.</p>

<h3>Nanshi Democratic Cup Football Match: Yingguang Loses Two Goals to Huaguang Today at 4:30 PM, a Match Between Daxia and Pan Team</h3>
<p>Led by Wu Qixiang, the Huaguang football team worked hard last night with high spirits and defeated Yingguang 2-0. This was one scene in the Democratic Cup. There was no record in the first half. Shang Shiqi scored both goals, one three minutes after the change of positions, and one in the last nine minutes. Yingguang's athletes Yu Qia and Xu Buyun, etc., all work at the China Bookstore Printing Factory. Recently, the factory has been working overtime day and night to print banknotes to increase production, and they are not allowed to ask for leave, so they were unable to play yesterday, which greatly affected their strength. However, it was not easy for the team to maintain a 0-0 draw in the first half. Liu Longsheng, He Jiatong and goalkeeper Zheng Tongyu performed very well. If all the players are present, Yingguang is indeed an organization that cannot be underestimated and can compete with any strong team. With Wu Qixiang in charge of the center, the rear is less worried, and the forwards can therefore exert great power, and victory is appropriate.</p>
<p>The Huaguang football team, led by host Huang Jiabang, took an overnight train to Hangzhou for sightseeing yesterday, and took the opportunity to hold friendly matches with the Huanhu team and Zhijiang University. They will return to Shanghai by overnight train on Friday.</p>
<p>Because the Jiuzhou team has a Qingbai Railway War this Sunday and needs to conserve their energy and prepare for a major event, team captain Meng Yiliang requested that the Jiuzhou vs. Huaguang match this Friday be moved to next week. At the same time, Huaguang also has a trip to Hangzhou, so there will be no battles in Nanshi on Friday. Also, the Pan team will be visiting West Lake next Monday.</p>

<p>Today at 4:30 PM, there will be another Democratic Cup football match in Nanshi, where Daxia will meet the Pan team. The referee is Wang Lin, and the linesmen are Tan Rongsheng and Zhu Yibao. The players on both sides are young and full of fighting spirit. The scene will definitely be intense. Daxia has a strong line and strong feet. The Pan team's forward line is flexible, Qian Ming is as light as a swallow, and his small movements are particularly clever and beautiful. The two sides are evenly matched, and the outcome is unpredictable. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Daxia</p>

<h3>Registration for the 9th 90-Year Cup Miniature Ball Extended by Four Days</h3>
<p>The registration for the 9th 90-Year Cup Miniature Football Tournament hosted by Xuhui Middle School was originally scheduled to close yesterday afternoon. Now, in order to allow the schools to prepare adequately, it has been extended by four days until the 16th (Saturday). Those who wish to join can complete the formalities at the Sports Department of the school on Xujiahui Road before that date.</p>
<h3>Football Commentary Last Week</h3>
<p>There was nothing exciting to say about the two甲level football league matches last week, and the wins and losses were not significant to the overall situation. Qian Ming performed the results of the Mayor's Cup champion and won the Jingwu Association. With the help of Aunt Feng, the leading team won the Zhichao Association with a score of 2-1; the championship will be decided in the Qingbai vs. Railway battle this weekend, and the football season can end in mid-month.</p>
<p>Except for Fang Renqiu, the young players of Jingwu were not in good condition. Jingren, Zhigang, Yuqi, etc. were tired due to track and field practice, and their performance was far from ideal. They lost a total of four goals. Apart from Zhai Xigen and Long Qingxiang's clear goals, the remaining two goals were no different from giving them away with both hands. One goal was due to Chen Huimin's leaving the goal too early, resulting in an empty goal. The other was when Chen Lianglian kicked the grass, which was taken advantage of by Huo Tikgen. Three of the four goals were scored by head, which shows that the head attacks of the Xilu forwards posed a great threat to Jingwu's defenders. It is a pity that they did not have the shooting ability, and they missed opportunities one after another.</p>
<p>In terms of offense, Jingwu's offense was sharp and put pressure on the Railway in the first ten minutes. When Wang Guoguang's strength failed, the forward lacked an inner forward to lead the way. Wang, Wu, Fang, and Chen each had a shot, but unfortunately they lacked experience and failed.</p>
<p>The railway picked up Wu Binghao and replaced him with Gai Ziwen to fill the left wing. The speed of the two wings was obviously enhanced, and there was a performance of both wings flying together. This is the most ideal forward line for the railway. When playing Qingbai this weekend, it is better to use this lineup to strengthen Qian's offensive and hold the determination to fight back to the death, which is enough to threaten Qingbai.</p>
<p>The Longtou team performed well at the beginning of the season, but their performance has been far inferior to that at the beginning of the season. There is an image of the Longtou team seeing the head but not the tail. The problem lies in the fact that there are too many contacts and competitions, and the players are already in a state of fatigue. Secondly, it is because all teams have made progress, while the Longtou team is still in a state of stagnation. Whether in Nanshi or Yiyuan, every game relies on strength rather than strategy, relying only on rushing, horizontal, and hard shots. In the second half, the wind only surrounded Zhichao for more than fifteen minutes without any gain. If it were not for the help of Aunt Feng and Sheng Peter's carelessness, which caused Zhichao to lose its momentum and lose another goal, then Longtou's defeat to Zhichao would have been possible. In defense, Zhichao laid down two doors, and the Longtou forwards' attack was blocked everywhere. Jiang Kun and Xia Shude had the opportunity. Unfortunately, they did not use angled shots and only made straight hard shots. Even a strong crossbow's tip can penetrate　　. They were all blocked by Qixiang and caught by Peter. Peter is like A Dou, and Qixiang is like Yu Long. Under Zhao Yun's cover, A Dou was only in danger but not harmed. The forwards are full of fighting spirit, but only lack experience. (Qi Gong)</p>

<h3>On Lying</h3>
<p>— Sobey</p>
<p>The difficulty of lying lies in the expression.</p>
<p>When children lie, before they even finish their words, the corners of their mouths already betray a guilty smile. It's the same with naive news reporters when they fabricate "April Fool's" fake news. These people's expressions (i.e., "acting") are simply not up to par.</p>
<p>There are two famous liars in the world whose acting is very authentic. One is Yang Mei from Sichuan, China, and the other is Mussolini, who has already been condemned by history to death. The former spared no effort to endure the suffering of hunger, upholding the spirit of "feeling the hunger of others as if it were one's own," and fabricating shocking "truths"—that one can survive without eating. She endured twenty-one days of the greatest human suffering (suffering sufficient to end her life) just to prove that "hunger is not a social problem." Liars who present themselves with an attitude of compassion for humanity abound, but few can be as sincere and earnest as Yang Mei. Therefore, when Yang Mei's news first appeared, the masses applauded and supported it, placing great hopes on her.</p>
<p>This shows that even the biggest lie, as long as the "acting" is authentic, is enough to make people believe it to be true, or at least half believe it. Today's professional liars, although they all proclaim to be saving the masses, their expressions and acting are too childish, so they cannot gain the trust of the people.</p>
<p>The other professional liar, Mussolini, although his acting was slightly inferior to our "Yang Mei," was able to "dedicate himself to the task until his dying day, seeing it through to the end." He talked nonsense all year round, claiming to be acting on behalf of Heaven, aiming to save countless people all over the world. The first time he said this, people didn't believe him; the second time, the third time, they still didn't believe him. But he was not discouraged, saying, "As long as you say it a hundred times in a row, people will believe it!" Mussolini was able to remain in power for more than twenty years entirely because of this method.</p>
<p>The spirit of the above two master liars can be emulated by today's liars.</p>
<p>Liars! Lie to your heart's content. Anyway, "People deceive people, deceiving people to death without compensation!" How about taking this common saying as your "motto"?</p>
<h3>Cat</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>When cats are mentioned, I have so much to say. -- A book dedicated to cats is called "Cat Garden." I don't intend to quote even a word or half a sentence from it to lengthen my writing. Now, I'm only talking about the impressions cats give me.</p>
<p>About eight or nine years ago, a black and white female cat suddenly came to my house. After it came, it never left. If you fed it rice, it would eat. If you picked it up and put it on your lap, it would not move. So people said, "Cats bring wealth, dogs bring poverty, that's a very good thing!" I also thought it was a very good thing. After a few years, it quietly left again. The reason why, I didn't know at that time. But it left behind a kitten, which was tortoiseshell colored, and not bad. This kitten now already has several generations of descendants. It's very well-behaved. When it begs me for fish bones, it even stands up like a pug, and can also use its two front paws to catch things. When I'm eating, it comes as soon as I call it. But at other times, I can't call it no matter how much I call. Not only can't I call it, but when it hears my voice, it simply ignores me, and sometimes even deliberately walks far away. So I get a little angry, feeling that cats are, after all, snobbish creatures. Based on the saying "Cats bring wealth," I can even more judge that cats are snobbish creatures. The old cat's coming and going must have been because my family used to have fish and meat to eat, but later it became less and less every day. At the same time, it found a wealthy new owner, so of course it had to turn its head and not return. This proves that my family certainly has very little meat to eat, but some people's families are much better than ours!</p>
<p>More than a month ago, that tortoiseshell cat also ran away. A week later, it came back dejectedly, and its weight was almost half less. After it came back, it immediately ate, and the amount it ate was even more than double what it usually ate. So I speculated that its motive for leaving was to find a more fishy bowl of rice, but as a result, it almost starved to death. This also proves that my family now has almost no meat to eat, but many families nearby are probably simply without meat, or perhaps even white rice has become a problem. Otherwise, in Jiangnan, where keeping cats is a common practice, how could it have starved for six or seven days? -- From the successive departures of two cats, I was able to realize a lesson in real life.</p>
<p>During the period of the occupation, I absolutely worshipped cats, not only "welcoming cats," but also willingly becoming a cat. I once asked a friend to draw a picture of a cat, and I even wrote a poem on it myself, saying: "I have wasted my life reading military strategies, and have never done anything to serve the country. The rats jump and make trouble in the bright daylight, and I am willing to transform into an old male cat." Cats are just cats, but my impression of them changes from time to time. Now, although I am still willing to be a cat, I definitely do not want to be a pet cat lying on the lap of a noble lady. I want to be an old male cat that catches jumping and cunning rats. As for cats playing with butterflies in the shade of flowers, they are even more what I despise. -- Postscript</p>
<h3>Change to Fifty Thousand</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Zhi</p>
<p>According to reports, the Central Bank has shipped a large number of five-yuan gold yuan notes from the United States, which were originally printed during the price-limited period last year. Now they have finally been shipped to port. "One step late," they can no longer be circulated on the market. The Central Bank considers the losses to be huge and is currently investigating responsibility, etc.</p>
<p>I think it is unnecessary to investigate responsibility. Because there was nothing wrong with printing five-yuan notes. If it were US dollars, it would not be too late to ship them now. The problem lies in inflation, so if we get to the bottom of it, it won't look good for anyone.</p>
<p>However, it would be a pity to discard this large batch of foreign-printed banknotes. So how to use them? I think it's very simple. As long as the Central Bank prints a "Change to Fifty Thousand" on them, like a stamp, they can be issued. Banknotes printed in the United States are naturally exquisitely printed and have excellent paper quality, which must be much more beautiful than the batch of ten thousand yuan notes printed by the Central Printing Factory. Then the people will be eager to welcome them, and naturally there will be nothing to say.</p>
<p>In this way, this batch of five-yuan foreign goods will not become a loss. It can both make the most of waste and alleviate the shortage of cash. Wouldn't it be killing two birds with one stone?</p>

<p>The trees on the grave have grown thick. A mound of yellow earth. Alas! Approaching the end. How long is life? About to emerge. 1</p>
<h3>Honest Reward</h3>
<p>— Chen Yaoguang</p>
<p>One of the two young ladies suddenly remembered that she had not bought a ticket when the bus was about to arrive at the station, so she wanted to go back to the carriage to buy a ticket.</p>
<p>The other one advised her not to, and said to her, "What will happen if you get off the bus without buying a ticket?"</p>
<p>"I think one should always be honest in life!" she said, and then went to buy a ticket.</p>
<p>After a while, she walked out of the carriage and said to her friend with a smile, "Look, haven't I been rewarded for my honesty? I gave him a one-yuan bill, and he actually gave me a five-yuan bill in change!"</p>
<h3>Remembering Mr. Liu Ziheng</h3>
<p>— Xu Ze</p>
<p>The three mysterious guests who came to Beijing from Pingyin once aroused the interest and attention of many people. One of them was Mr. Liu Ziheng. He and I have a past relationship, which I will briefly introduce here. I think it is also something that people from all walks of life would like to hear. Mr. Liu is from Shandong, tall and thin, and usually wears a blue gown. He is vegetarian and does not eat meat. Because he grew up in Shandong, he deeply studied the doctrines of Confucius and Mencius from a young age, and he especially studied the Lao-Zhuang School. He is indeed a well-learned scholar.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 30th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Liu and I met at the guesthouse of the Third War Zone Commander's Office. At that time, Mr. Liu and Mr. Liu Yizheng were both honored guests of Gu Mosan. At that time, Mr. Liu had just come from Hengyang. He looked like he was in his forties, sincere and honest, and kind to people. In addition to explaining Zhuangzi to Gu Mosan, he also discussed ancient and modern times with Mr. Yizheng every day, and the listeners were moved. When the Zhejiang-Jiangxi War broke out, he moved to Mafu in Jianyang, Fujian, with Mr. Yizheng, which was less than a hundred steps away from my residence. Whenever the sun set in the west, he would wander along the river with Mr. Yizheng, Brother Yang Tiandao, and me to express the accumulated feelings of the day. Not long after, when the Japanese bandits withdrew from Yushan, Mr. Liu had a trip to Guangxi, so he said goodbye to us and left. Now it has been eight or nine years since I last saw him. This time, he came to Beijing from Pingyin to seek peace for the country, to seek welfare for the people, and to eliminate the difficulties of peace talks. Is his contribution less than what it was in the past!</p>
<h3>A Record of Seeking Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>— Bai Chu</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>My friend contracted lung disease.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>He noticed blood streaks in his sputum and remembered the afternoon fever he had recently been experiencing, which made him suspect that he had lung disease.</p>
<p>Lung disease is terrible, especially for a salaried worker with the burden of a family. He had to reluctantly spend money that was originally intended for buying rice to consult a doctor and seek a diagnosis.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The consultation fee for the first doctor was 10,000. After taking an X-ray, he concluded: "There are a few black spots on your lungs." He felt that this was not getting to the point.</p>
<p>The consultation fee for the second doctor was 40,000. After taking an X-ray, he also concluded: "Your lungs are full of black spots."</p>
<p>The third doctor was a Ph.D. from Germany and a lung disease expert. The consultation fee was two silver dollars, and he stipulated that he would not accept gold yuan notes. After taking an X-ray, the doctor said very seriously:</p>
<p>"There is something wrong with your left lung."</p>
<p>"Are there some black spots in some places?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm afraid it's already corroding."</p>
<p>Oh my god! He gasped.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Lung disease was a definite fact, although the degree of the three doctors' diagnoses differed.</p>
<p>But one thing was consistent: they all told him to go to the hospital quickly, get lung disease-specific medicine, and have regular check-ups.</p>
<p>Hospital? How could a poor public school teacher afford to stay in a hospital?</p>
<p>My friend gritted his teeth and prepared to tough it out.</p>
<p>However, his family panicked, and his friends also panicked. This thing can take people's lives! How could he "tough it out"?</p>
<p>After much persuasion from many people, he understood the ancient saying, "As long as the green hills remain, there's no need to worry about firewood," and agreed to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>So: he took off his watch, and his wife took out the gold earrings and gold bracelets that she had brought as dowry.</p>
<p>Holding more than 600,000 in cash, he stepped into a hospital that others recommended as the most affordable.</p>
<p>After explaining his purpose, the hospital staff handed him a price list, scrutinizing him with cold eyes. Indeed, he was dressed too poorly.</p>
<p>My friend stared at the price list. Naturally, first class was out of his reach, so he could skip it.</p>
<p>What about second class? 50,000 a day, plus 100,000 for food and injections. He couldn't afford it!</p>
<p>Third class was marked as sixteen people per room, totaling 60,000 a day. He didn't want that either.</p>
<p>But, but there was no fourth class. He calculated for a long time before deciding to slowly walk to the registration window.</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>He registered and presented the pile of cash he had just exchanged for things.</p>
<p>The abacus inside made a series of sounds, and then a sentence was thrown out:</p>
<p>"Pay 1.4 million first."</p>
<p>"What! That much?" My friend was shocked.</p>
<p>Perhaps the gentleman inside was already used to such questions. He was not flustered and calmly recited the bill with a hint of sarcasm:</p>
<p>"A deposit of 800,000, and an advance payment of 600,000 for ten days of expenses, totaling 1.4 million."</p>
<p>"Deposit? Why do you need a deposit?"</p>
<p>"This is the hospital's rule. All hospitals are like this. Without a deposit, who will we turn to if you can't pay the bill in the future?"</p>
<p>"Then let me find a guarantor!"</p>
<p>"Please don't joke. We only accept deposits and don't want any shop or factory guarantors."</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>My friend couldn't get into the hospital.</p>
<p>He deposited the cash for a few days of interest, bought silver dollars, bought and sold, and now he's doing quite well, steadily earning tens of thousands of yuan every day.</p>
<p>I saw him recently, and he was radiant. I don't know if it's a periodic flare-up of stage X lung disease, or if it's because he's getting rich and happy.</p>
<p>But one thing is worth noting: his family is no longer worried about his illness.</p>
<p>Maybe he's already healed.</p>
