<p>——建議當局開辦銀元存款——</p>
<p>中央銀行為了救濟一般生產事業，特於前幾天舉辦兩種貸款，一為臨時直接貸款；另為收購棉紗貸款。當此工商產業瀕於破產的邊緣，這種及時的貸款，誠可謂「雪中送炭」；無論如何，原則上是不可非議的。不過就這兩天市塲上的情勢而論，顯然引起了很大的變化，尤其是銀根的鬆弛，甚至於濫，以致金·鈔·銀元等，無不身價百倍，以黃金而言，昨日市價，已逾百億大關，美鈔也已越過二千萬大關，更足以顯示出上海的游資已在那裏蠢動了。若不及早設法疏導，恐怕難免要造成洪流的冲積，弄到不可收拾的危局。</p>
<p>在理論上，疏導游資的方法，誠屬不少，類如發行公債，提倡儲蓄，拋售物資，金·銀·銀元，出售國營資產，成立投資市塲，以及鼓勵人民投資於房地產等；但在現階段中，這許多方法，恐怕都不容易辦到。即使舉辦也不會發生效力。因為發行公債，政府的信用，還沒有恢復到戰前的地步，銷路方面，大有問題，提倡儲蓄，在當前幣値極不穩定的時候，除非辦理有切實保障存戶利益的保値存款，殆難引起人民的興趣；拋售金·銀·銀元·物資等，根本無法辦到，即使拋售銀元，但銀元在目前即是鉅額的大鈔，更有助長游資的聲勢，審多利少；至於成立投資市塲，在當前工商業一片不景氣聲中，恐亦不易收到實效。餘如出售國營資產與鼓勵人民投資房地產等，在此兵荒馬亂之際，事實上也等於紙上談兵；故目前要談到疏導游資，實在是一件絕對困難的事情，若不能坐視不救，我們認為只有從事開辦銀元·存款業務，或較能得到效益。</p>
<p>銀元存款業務，最初曾由甘肅省銀行試辦，嗣經學術界人士的倡議，遂引起社會上普遍的注意；今年三月十一日本市金融界星五座談會曾集中討論，會談結果，大都認為該項業務，在此幣値動盪的局面下，仍不失為唯一疏導游資的有效對策。同時，財金當局，亦鑒于銀元存款對於吸收游資的作用，故在修正後的財金改革新方案中，加以採用，並通令全國各地實行。至於本市當局認為情形特殊，暫緩辦理；因此，本市的銀元存款業務，還沒有正式的展開。但地下存放，不特早已開始，而且已經盛行，該項利率，據十九日金融日報所載，約在月息八分至一角之間，足見社會人士，對銀元存款需要的殷切，已達到如何的程度了。</p>
<p>現在銀元已普遍的作為使用的籌碼，故所謂游資或是過剩的購買力，不但要包括銀元持有者在內，而且要以銀元持有者為對象，吾人以為銀元本身具有實値，人民在被徵用（即交存銀行）葉較能獲得保障的機會，必不致過份的逃避，况且銀元存款單位數量，與金圓劵根本有異。吸收銀元存款，在質的方面，自然要比較實在得多，這樣對於舉辦存款的效果而言，當然是相當的宏大。不過要從講求銀元存款的交通，和改變人民儲蓄的傾向上去防制游資的作祟，必須注意銀元存款的技術，最主要的，如利率的高低，期限的長短，和牌價伸縮要合乎市塲的自然水準等。總之，我們覺得這次銀行對於銀元存款的信用，必須切實加以保障，銀元存款的信用，也就是銀行本身的信用，若銀行無法維持存款的信用，那也就等於整個銀行垮台了。這一點，銀行界本身不得不特別加以注意。其次，吸存的機構，最好交與商業銀行，以免牽涉到政治漩渦，在還未付息的時候，必須以硬幣支付，以充實信用，至於尾差數目，現在已有銀角問世，角以上單位的收付，當無問題，分數以下，數目微小，如用牌價折合金圓券支付，亦無傷存款人的利益。</p>
<p>本市現値作戰時期，一切需求安定，以避免許多不必要的驚擾，防制游資作祟，不但可以防制物價的奔騰。而且也是安定金融之道。現在游資醞釀的風暴，即將來襲，當局尤不可不注意防患於未然，至於開辦銀元存款，只不過是當前防制游資泛濫，較為具體而有效的一種對策而已！</p>
<h3>月浦前綫行</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員式之</p>
<p>我們這一行於是改由一個　地的小路分散前進，這時，飛機走開，砲聲又響起來了！二百公尺在當時眞是一個多麼遙遠的途程，好容易，我們步過一座石橋，走入約四五戶人家的一個村莊，在一間裝有玻璃窗，擺着紅漆八仙桌的屋子裏會到了某師郭永師長，張燦光團長，還有參加指揮出擊的某軍鄒鵬奇軍長和周源根參謀長</p>
<p>原來國軍在前線所構筑的陣地確係「袋形陣地」，計北自×××經×××至××為一大口袋，××經×××，×××，××為另一大口袋；××經××，××××至××為又一大口袋，大口袋中又分成若干小口袋，由於在各布達佩斯尖端亦卽國軍陣地最突出處之獅子林，月浦，楊行，劉行等地國軍工事堅強，將士用命，並富有獨立作戰精神，致使共軍一週來損折兩個軍，仍毫無所獲。</p>
<p>據楊參謀長談：十廿日夜共軍卅一軍一部續向月浦楊行間國軍袋形陣地猛犯，在距此莊南百餘公尺處的顏家宅國軍陣地悉被共軍砲火所燬，連長朱相文率所部全部陣亡，十八日國軍鄒鵬奇軍某師曁原來郭師曁戰車一部配合下向前反擊，在三小時前收復顏家宅，恢復原陣地，將進入袋形陣地共軍全部殲滅，鄒郭諸將軍就是親來這第一綫督戰的。</p>
<p>由於月浦國軍陣地過於突出，加以當時戰事尚在進行，因此，我們只能同至附近高地，以望遠鏡向西瞭望。這裏西距月浦不到一華里，故在一萬倍望遠鏡中，殘敗之月浦房屋，可歷歷在目，而展開在眼前業已成熟但無人收割的一片金黃色麥海，尤令人增無限感慨。據戴處長吿：為了顧及老百姓，在過去，我們不忍將卽將成熟的麥苗割去，為了老百姓，同樣地，雖然由於軍事上的「掃淸射界」，但仍盡可能不拆老百姓的房屋，但想不到這正給予共軍進攻時最有利的掩護，否則，共軍的傷亡，必較今日為尤重。張團長說：「直到現在，月浦街上，尚有屍體二千餘具，槍六百餘枝，雙方因避免犧牲，旣無人敢出而掩埋，亦無人敢檢取槍枝，日前我軍大掃蕩時，嘗檢得一百餘枝」。</p>
<p>這時砲聲又起，有一彈正落屋東百餘公尺田野間，郭師長根據聲音判斷謂係共軍之野砲，他說：「每天自夕陽西下後，這裏可眞熱鬧呢？」接着他又問我「怕不怕」？我回答說：「有你們在，我就不怕了」！</p>
<p>在我與鄒軍長的談話中，我獲知該軍前任軍長胡長靑在四月廿四於宣城之役胸部中彈受傷，現在台灣療養，但無生命危險，差不多在同時，川中名將楊森之倒楊幹才軍長則於灣沚力戰陣亡，胡與我係初交，在去冬遨遊　縣勝境瑯琊古剎時他請我吃過飯，楊則堪稱莫逆，他引為軍中鍼言的：「錐離不開親兄弟，出征離不開父子兵」。每一念及，輒為神往，今天獲悉他們一負傷一陣亡的消息，我的心情是頗為複雜而沉重的。</p>
<p>在拜別鄒郭諸將軍的歸途中，機關槍聲已漸漸疏遠，以雙方的砲兵仍繼續在怒吼，我們是在雙方砲兵發砲時砲彈弧綫所構成的死角中行進，但間亦有共方的砲彈在我們附近投落，因此，我們都抱着戒愼恐懼的心情分散開來，擇地勢低窪的小徑前行，一路上，我看到長得肥大結實的　豆沒有人拮採，纍纍低垂一片金黃的麥穗也無人收割，所有經過的遠近民房裏看不到一縷炊煙，一個老百姓。王科長和我說：今年這裏確是豐年，但戰地的老百姓確已做到毁家抒難，因此他有一次當谷委員正綱到前方時，曾當面向他建議：應該把往港台等地作「高等難民」的在滬房屋讓這批無家可歸的眞正難民住，否則這戰爭所給予人民的負担也就太不公允。谷委員同意他的看法，但認為問題在實行起來的困難委實太多。</p>
<p>好容易，大槪至少走了三四里，我們才步上寳（山）吳（淞）公路，在這裏，我們看到用以開山的機器車在做工事，成羣的運送傷兵的担架隊和卡車隊向南駛去，戰車隊向北駛來，安排在公路邊的野砲隊正在向西砲擊。</p>
<p>在公路邊，我發現我們的吉普正停在拉砲的十輪卡裏相等，於是我們總算初步結束了這一段最艱苦的旅程，大家坐上吉普，在車中，我問柴司機怕不怕？他說：不怕，八一三時他就替報館開車子跑戰地的王科長又吿訴我：「上海保衛戰發生後，合衆社嘗派人坐在戰車內跑戰地，但當甫近前綫時作為前導的第一輛戰車卽被共軍平射砲擊中受傷，因此該洋記者所坐的一輛戰車只可於中途拖着那一輛負傷的戰車折回後方去了！記者跑戰地而遭遇驚險塲面的，應以申報為嚆矢」。（續完）</p>

<h3>貝文先艾契遜抵達巴黎　英美法將舉行會談　檢討德國問題共同對策</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕英美蘇三國外長均已於今日啟程赴巴黎，以準備出席廿三日揭幕之四強外長會議。美國務卿艾契遜定今夜自華盛頓乘飛機出發，將及時趕到巴黎，與英法外長在外長會議揭幕前舉行會談，以統一三強在會中之步驟。莫斯科來電謂，蘇外長維辛斯基亦將在廿四小時內離蘇京飛巴黎。英外相貝文今晨離倫敦機時，向記者談及此次會議可能獲得之結果時，表示「全憑上帝決定」。今距會議之揭幕已不過四十八小時，全歐人士莫不以緊張心之召開，係四強最近在紐約議定解除柏林封鎖時所決定。</p>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎十九日電〕此間美英法三國外交高級官員，已於今日完成一連串關於巴黎外長會議準備之戰略談判。彼等刻正等候英外相貝文於二十日及美國務卿艾契遜廿一日來巴黎。三國代表曾舉行七次秘密會議，據悉，代表業已擬就一完全之計劃，俾艾契遜·貝文及許曼能與雜辛斯基一致同意。</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦十九日電〕英內閣十九日以全權界予貝文外相，俾貝文可在巴黎外長會議中，拒絕任何足使蘇聯控制德國之建議，據悉，英內閣并已決定拒絕任何以東西發行之馬克價值相等為基礎之德國經濟統一之建議。貝文外相率領代表團一行五十人，於二十日乘火車赴巴黎。十九日英閣議乃在全面檢討巴黎會議中可能引起之局勢。</p>
<h3>艾契遜闡明外交政策　美國會全力支持　重建西德計劃決不放棄</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十九日電〕參院外委會主席康納利今晚稱，該會完全支持艾契遜對解決德國問題所採立場，并稱：艾氏赴巴黎時，已獲得參院充分支持。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕國務卿艾契遜定明日飛往巴黎出席四國外長會議，今日在參院外委會秘密會議詳細報告美國外交政策，事後發表聲明稱，美國在西德重建民主之方針，決不變更，在巴黎會議中對蘇聯決不遷就，聽任其勢力擴展至西德。</p>
<p>艾氏并警告稱，四國會議之成悲觀，無人能預測，對其結果不必悲觀，語料　不可存奢望。美國外交政策堅定一貫，如以為稍有初步成功，即對建立自由世界之工作不復加緊努力，不免造成悲劇。但渠繼稱，此次會議對於德國之統一，與蘇聯成立協定之機會，可能較已往迭次會議為佳。總之，吾人無論如何切望成立協議，絕無意犧牲已獲之成就，「阻碍其將來之進展」。艾氏并闡明美外交政策大綱稱，「吾人應有定力，決不能隨國際氣溫之升降而轉移，以免蘇聯操縱我國外交關係。我國外交政策之調在查於獲致和平安全之世界，已往如此，將來亦必奉為主驢」。</p>
<h3>促成德國統一　國強立場不同</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕在參加巴黎外長會之西方三國中，英國自信較美法兩國更願意德國之於此時獲得統一。英工常政府與德社會黨在信仰上的聯繋，堪稱一致，因此相信在德社會黨領導之下，統一的德國必能致力於歐洲的復興，而不致威脅鄰國的安全。英人并覺英美法三國雖均願意德國在特定的條件之下獲得統一，但美國目前尚不擬支援充份的德國統一措施。第一美國深恐德統一經濟制度的設立，將使德共黨有阻碍西德復興工作的機會。再者美國亦反對魯爾區及其他德重工業之公有制度，若德國之經濟權操諸社會黨或共黨之手，則建立此等公有制的可能性將愈大。法國之反對德國之統一過速，則完全係基於安全理由。英人相信大部份法人仍主張在長時期內，德國能保持分裂狀態。同時據一部份專家預料，蘇聯在外長會中將作重大的讓步，以促成德國的統一，因此故意恐嚇法國，以造成大西洋國家內部的緊張心理。</p>
<h3>西德選舉法　三強獲致協議</h3>
<p>〔路透社法蘭克福十九日電〕此間法官方聲稱：法國政府以不得已的心情，決定批準西德聯邦議會之選舉法後，盟國間已就該選舉法獲致協議。法國政府批準該法之際，曾提出若干保留，聲明制憲議會所保留之若干權限，應於議會解散憲法公布後由邦總理行使。西方三強軍事副督今日在柏林開會，起草致西德邦總理之共同函，以通知此項決議。</p>
<p>〔合眾社慕尼黑二十日電〕巴威略議會頃以一〇一對六四票，九票棄權，拒絕波恩議會所草擬之西德憲法。西德十一聯邦中，四個聯邦議會業已通過波恩憲法。該憲法需要三分之二聯邦之批準。巴威略乃第一個拒絕該憲法之聯邦，惟巴威略議會決定如其他三分之二聯邦通過該憲法，則巴議會亦將予以接受。同時巴威略議會并一致通過一建議，要求美軍政府將德憲法問題交人民投票。</p>
<h3>對未來外長會議　英人士觀感</h3>
<p>認未必能有重大收獲</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕英國一般人士對於本屆巴黎外長會議之收獲，似多漠不關心，由於冷戰持續已久，而國內之節約計劃已使人民處處受有拘束，故一般平民最關切者，祇為如何可獲得足量的煙捲，與如何可以舒適地渡假。報紙除「每日郵報」及「泰晤士報」外，極少提及巴黎會議。「每日郵報」認為封鎖之解除，并非蘇聯讓步或善意的表示，故希望西方國家能懷具戒心。「泰晤士報」預料外長會議的收穫，至多為使德國組成一個具有兩個單位的鬆懈聯邦，以牽就現成東西德間的旣成事實，其中央機構不過僅使德國在經濟上趨於統一而已。政府人士之意見可分兩派，一派認為蘇聯的讓步，不過為對德人的一種宣傳；一派則認蘇聯乃不得不作讓步。蘇聯為插足魯爾區之管制，或將同意不向德國索取實物賠償。</p>
<h3>海姆斯丹特公路　蘇暫予開放</h3>
<p>漢堡駛柏林卡車又被阻</p>
<p>〔合眾社柏林十九日電〕蘇聯十九日暫時解除海姆斯丹特公路上的封鎖，使被阻達四十二小時的卡車駛入柏林，但同時蘇聯又開始阻止循漢堡公路駛往柏林的卡車。西方盟國當局對蘇聯阻撓策略，感到眩惑及震怒。關於海姆斯丹特公路的開放，係在英佔領軍參謀總長魏斯德洛勃向蘇方提出抗議後數分種內即實現者，但蘇方并未作任何解釋。</p>
<h3>馬休斯長海軍部　美參院核準</h3>
<p>克萊晉升四星上將</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕美參院今日批準任命馬休斯為海軍部長，同時準許前德境美軍總督克萊退休，晉升四星上將。此外并批準金巴爾為海次，格萊為陸次。</p>
<h3>龐賽被任命　法駐德高級專員</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十九日電〕前法車駐德大使龐賽，已被任命為法駐德高級專員。龐氏年六十二，新聞記者出身，一九三一年任法駐德大使一九三八年任駐義大使。大戰瀑發後，被德秘密警察拘於集中營內，至勝利後始獲釋。</p>
<h3>蘇宣布剩餘日俘九萬五千　本年內全部遣回　盟總估計蘇境日俘尚留四十餘萬</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科二十日電〕蘇聯官方今日宣布，蘇聯境內剩餘日本戰俘九萬五千名，將於本年五月至十一月底全部遣回日本，僅有一部份戰爭犯例外。所有遣散費用，應由日政府負担。戰時蘇聯共獲得日戰俘五十九萬四千名，其中七萬另八百十名已於一九四五年直接釋放，另四十一萬八千一百六十六名在一九四九年五月一日前遣返。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京二十日電〕蘇聯宣布蘇境僅剩日俘九萬五千名，麥帥總部官員表示驚訝。據總部遣俘司長安特遜估計，蘇境尚留日俘四十萬八千七百廿九名。</p>
<h3>夏威夷美陸海軍　今秋大演習</h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山十九日電〕陸軍部頃宣布：夏威夷島今秋將舉行陸海軍大演習，歸克拉克將軍全面指揮。克氏目前已與第一機動艦隊司令波根討論此計劃。演習時將有大批侵入部隊出動，包括第六軍第二步兵師主力隊在內。</p>
<h3>尼泊爾申請加入聯合國　蘇聯表示反對</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十九日電〕安理會聯合國會員資格審查委會今日審查尼泊爾加入聯合國之聲請時，蘇聯代表表示反對。渠謂根據所已知之情報觀，渠對尼泊爾之已為主權及獨立國，尚不感覺滿意，故渠主張暫勿討論尼泊爾之聲請，以待更詳細情報之獲得。渠并指出一九二三年英國與尼泊爾所締之條約，實際上祇使尼泊爾完全聽命於英國，并不使尼泊爾有對外關係之主權。烏克蘭代表加拉迦亦支援蘇聯之立場，指尼泊爾之外匯完全由印度控制。中英美法埃挪加拿大等國則均支援尼泊爾之聲請。主席法代表羅士謂尼泊爾之代表現已在紐約，渠建議由本委會請該代表提供尼泊爾與英國間所締一切條約之充份情報。蘇代表仍表示渠對本委會之是否有權要求此項情報，尚表懷疑。渠主張由本委會呈報安理會，聲明關於尼泊爾部份所獲情報尚不充份，再由安理會決定應採何種措施。</p>
<h3>蘇建議三強討論希局　美英率直予以拒絕　堅持應在聯合國範圍內求解決　英表示不願造成「慕尼黑第二」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓二十日廣播：美國務院二十日發表聲明，拒絕蘇聯擬在聯合國外解決希臘內戰之建議，并謂美國歡迎蘇聯善意的措置，終止共黨支持叛軍，藉以解決希臘內戰。該項聲明係於杜魯門與內閣議後發表。國務院稱：除非希臘鄰邦停止助希遊擊隊，則美國仍將繼續予古希臘以軍事援助。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二十日廣播：英外交部頃宣布：英國拒絕蘇聯主張召開三強會議解決希臘問題之建議。外部發言人稱，英國不願違反希政府之意旨，犧牲希臘，造成慕尼黑第二</p>
<h3>美停止日賠償　中菲表示異議　顧維鈞指責與國際協定牴觸</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十九日電〕中國菲律賓兩國代表，本日對於五月十二日美國向遠東委員會所提出關於日本賠償問題及工業水準之立場，均表示異議。</p>
<p>中國代表顧維鈞博士對於渠之政府立場採取保留狀態，渠稱：中國政府之立場，將在遠東委員會下屆會議中發表正式文告，予以聲明但渠又稱：「中國政府獲悉美國對於向日本索取賠償之重要問題，突然改變一事，深為扼腕，…吾人相信此等意見與一連串尊嚴之國際協定及決議，互相牴觸。」顧氏稱：美國之意見并不顧及太平洋之安全，且與對日佔領之基本原則及目標不相符合。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕菲律賓代表羅慕洛，今日在遠東委員會痛斥美國停運日本賠償品之決定。據稱：「此舉不啻恢復日本之作戰能力，日本財閥正在破壞美國復興日本經濟之努力，事實證明造成，以便引起美國之同情，并確保美國之援助。美國停止搬運賠償品之最大理由，為減輕美國納稅人供應日本之負担，殊不知此種負担大部份乃日人不能自助所致，尤其是財閥在幕後作弄。日本財閥欲東山再起，須重振陸海軍，吾人須及時制止此種野心。截至目前為止，日本賠償品之運往菲律賓，英國，中國與荷蘭者，大部份為母機與其他配備，總值約一億七千萬元，并無一家工廠拆卸。菲律賓政府仍望遠東委員會能對賠償問題成立公正與滿意的解決辦法。」</p>

<h3>法內閣醞釀危機　獨立保守黨反對財政措施</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎二十日電〕法內閣中獨立保守黨員之「叛亂」，已使成立迄今已有八閱月之居伊內閣，有垮臺之虞。經濟部長畢奈曁航空市長莫魯向彼等同黨之國會議員卅五人表示，彼等堅決反對政府應付八百五十億預算不足額之措施。彼等認為政府現有的財政法案，完全與物價穩定政策有悖。議會人士認為此兩閣員之表示，已引起政治上的緊張空氣，但彼等仍信居伊總理可望獲得折衷方案，以免財政法案交議會辯論時被否決。</p>

<h3>市場交易紊亂　金價直綫飛升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市場，因大局關係，人心浮動，外象環境利多，市況極度混亂，若干金號，紛紛均已暫停買賣，場內照例漲停板，再度掛高至七九億六千二百六十六萬，有求無供，仍陷停頓。場外喊價漫無標準，直綫飛升，但成交極少，無人供售，形成單面求進之勢。晨開七五億，七八億，央行未有動靜。霎時連衝三節，十時後已出一百億大關，最高曾抵一一〇億，一二〇億，午市為一〇五億，一一五億，午後漲勢尤厲，自一一五億，一二五億，一路升至一二〇億，一三〇億收盤，較五日勁跳五〇億，漲達七成之鉅。</p>

<p>（一）小白菜　隨時可以播種，半月後即可采食，撒播條播均可。未撒種子前，先將土地耙鬆，如若天氣乾燥，撒種蓋土後，澆水一二次，到發芽後生長二三個小菜子的時候，施用腐熟糞水一次，半個月以後，長到四五個菜子，就可以采食了。</p>
<p>（二）莧菜　栽培法同小白菜，發芽十天後，可以采食幼苗，連根拔取，如長到苗長四五寸時，摘取嫩芽佐食，根部仍可留在土中，再發新芽供食。如此連續摘取，僅須注意每半個月施用糞水一次，以及按日灌溉一次，栽種之後，可連續不斷的供給三個月食用。</p>
<p>（三）甘藍（即捲心菜）　用現成菜苗，移植在做成畦的園地內。行與行的距離，以及株與株的距離，都約在一尺五寸左右。其他施肥，灌溉均同小白菜。一個月後，即可采食嫩菜，二個月後開始結球，再有一個月，就可摘球供食。</p>
<p>（四）豇豆　用育成幼苗，移植園地，或用豆種直接撒播在園地亦可，兩種栽培法全以每株三四苗為宜。株與株的距離，以尺半為宜。在撒播發芽後，苗散過多時，可酌量拔去弱苗。苗長一尺高時，紮架以便攀附。以後的施肥灌溉，與小白菜同。二三月後，可以摘取豆莢佐食。</p>
<p>（五）青皮冬瓜　每穴埋植種子五六枚。天氣乾燥時，每日澆水一二次，發芽後，拔去弱苗，每穴留二三苗即可，以後注意施肥，灌溉二個半月後，即可采食。</p>
<p>（六）茄子　栽培法同豇豆。二個月後即可采食。</p>
<p>（七）大豆　栽培法同豇豆。二個半月後可采食毛豆。三個月即成黃豆。</p>
<p>（八）刀豆　栽培法同大豆。惟以紮成籬架適於攀附為宜。成熟期同豇豆。</p>

<h3>北平和平真象（續昨）</h3>
<p>這次入城式的作用，主要的目的是示威，叫北平人看看他們有那麼多的軍隊，有那麼好的武器，結果目的總算達到了，好多外國記者看後，都感到驚奇，尤以美國朋友，看到他們為要防禦蘇聯，裝備給國軍的十五生地大砲，裝甲車及坦克，今均插上鮮艷的蘇旗，其懊喪之情，更可想見。但第二天我聽到裝甲車第三團的朋友講起，入城式所用裝甲車廿八輛，坦克車六輛，十五生地大砲二門，其中廿四輛裝甲車及全數的坦克車大砲，都是跟國軍借的，二日早晨借去後，臨時把國徽刷去，改漆五角紅星，耀武揚威的跑了一天，四日下午就又漆好國徽送還了。他在東北得去多少，雖不知道，但在北平所誇耀的，則是借來充場面的。但這種內情，固有幾個人知道，而他們示威的目的，究竟達到了，尤其是對外國朋友。</p>
<p>主角概況述完，茲再報告些配角情況。主要的配角，要算各部份共黨所組的藝工隊了，他們早上八點就出現在街頭，裝備成奇形怪狀，各出心裁，但十分之九都是以毛像蘇旗作前導，幾個搽粉化裝「戰犯」作中隊，後面跟着紙包頭紅粉巾的男女，扭着秧歌前進，再後就是搖旗吶喊的羣眾了。最使人注目的，要算國立長春大學了，他們用木頭作了一個大鳥龜，下部四輪作為四足，龜頭鑲白，一個曾經他們高喊過萬歲的總統，面首龜背，上坐一戴花旗帽的美國人，四面啣着李宗仁，陳誠，孫科，陳立夫四個戰犯，每人背上插着「槍決某某戰犯一名」的標幟，李·陳是軍服閃耀，孫是西裝筆挺，陳是藍袍玄褂，前二人掬，後二人推，這個藝工隊次日特別為人民日報所推崇，認為他們設計新穎，技術高明。羣眾們被教喊的口號，大槪是下列數種：（一）歡迎人民解放軍，（二）慶祝北平解放，（三）革命到底，（四）粉碎和平陰謀，（五）和平陰謀是美國製造的廉價商品，（六）打倒和平政客，（七）打到南京并活捉蔣介石，（八）堅持毛主席八條件。</p>
<p>二月十二日，卽舊曆正月十五日，是北平市民慶祝北平解放大會，這個慶祝大會，是幾個解放前醞釀和平，共黨所稱的偽參議員，聯絡全市原有的偽保甲長籌備的，目的是在向共黨獻媚，表示效忠，籌備之初同事前沒與共黨接頭，那幾天共黨因忙於接收，也沒理會，誰知快到期了，人民日報忽對這位籌備員指為「CC」，這個是特務。并說他們籌開此會，事前沒得到當局的許可，不準他們籌備，拍馬屁拍得出蹶子了，但是已鬧得騎虎不能下背，幾經婉請，後來改由共黨主持，這才如期開會。前一天晚上，各保甲長通知每戶出一代表，早上九點到指定地點集合，屆時點名，那時各學校都沒開學，又通知各學校校長，把學生找來參加開會。這個會是在天安門開來，上午十點就人山人海，蘇旗飄揚，但是參加的人，每個人都知道大家是怎樣來的。十點半，「北平人民自己的市長」葉劍英訓話了，他先歌頌了一番北平式的和平，喊了幾句這個萬歲那個萬歲的口號，隨即强調共產黨絕不受騙，絕不接受美國導演的偽裝和平，堅決主張須先作到毛主席的八條件，才能談和，最後宣告北平人民政府在軍團管制期間的任務是：（一）完全肅清潛伏市內的反革命勢力，（二）建立革命政權，（三）接收各機關，（四）建設民主的新秩序，（五）解散國民黨，民社黨，青年黨及一切反動黨派和團體，（六）逮捕各級戰犯及反動份子，好多人在恭聆之餘，直在偷偷的打冷顫。開會之後，緊接着又是遊行，我在路旁看到好多作校長的朋友，拉着一張無可奈何的臉，手中提着一面小紅旗，領着還沒吃早午兩餐的學生，有氣沒力的在喊「和平陰謀是美國製造的廉價商品」，長大傑作的龜車又出現了，各部份共產黨藝工隊又扭秧歌了，但人們已司空見慣，路旁參觀羣眾已少多了。（未完待續）</p>
<h3>來源劇減　菜價暴漲　籲請放運須待當局核準</h3>
<p>〔華東社〕由於戰事關係，各種小菜來源大減，昨日市價一致暴漲，豬肉每斤一千二百萬元，黃魚每斤四百萬元，蠶豆青菜每斤六十萬元，鹹菜每斤八十萬元，均較前日暴漲一倍至三倍不等。市府副秘書長王大均談稱：昨日本市因浦東等處戰事激烈，蔬菜來源發生影響，致市價狂漲，關係民食至鉅，蔬菜市場籲請市府準予將郊區蔬菜放運，現尚待軍事最高當局核準。</p>
<h3>國民黨市黨部方主委　喚起市民保衛大上海</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕國民黨市黨部主委方治為喚起市民對保衛大上海之認識，及發動勸募勞軍運動，特於昨日假凱旋電台廣播，題目「保衛大上海」，原文略謂：</p>
<p>同胞們：在這個上海郊區砲火瀰天，爭取勝利的關頭，前方加緊衝鋒嘶殺戰鬥，而市區秩序必須力求安寗鎮定，我們千萬不要妄聽謠言，不要自相驚擾，要知道國軍陸海空三總司令坐鎮上海，督導這神聖的剿匪戰爭，其目的是在求上海之保衛，則我們唯有軍民通力合作，一德一心，共同維護市區的治安，保護公用及生產事業，才能達到此目的，其有不肖之徒，乘機搗亂造謠惑眾者，即為吾全市市民的公敵，當地政府及軍事機關對此敗類自應格殺勿論，因為不如此，不足以安內，不安內不足以剿匪，尚望我各界同胞注意及此。</p>
<h3>沿江路面封鎖　熱鬧變為凄清　各綫公共車輛更改起迄站</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕淞滬警備司令部為加强市區治安，昨日起自復興島至南碼頭沿江路面均予封鎖，於是向來熱鬧之外灘一帶，一變而為靜寂凄清。外白渡畔及各條通外灘之馬路口，均派有軍警站崗，禁止普通車輛行人通行。沿外灘一帶之高樓大廈均緊閉大門，槪由通南北馬路之後門或邊門出入。所有途經外灘一帶之電車公共汽車均已更改起迄站，公共汽車九路十路縮短路線在南京路中央路掉頭，三路在愛多亞路外灘掉頭，十四路在北京路四川路口掉頭，四路十一路則以天潼路為終點。有軌電車二路終點改在南京路江西路口。七路八路十路十一路一律以外白渡橋北堍為終點，自北向南行駛者至該處後乘客一律下車，然後空車行駛過橋至五馬路外灘掉頭駛回。赴虹口之乘客在外白渡橋北堍上車。僅有一路電車尚可載客經外灘，惟外灘站頭已改在南京路華懋飯店門口及外白渡橋北堍。由於各種車輛改道行駛及變更上下站關係，接近外灘之各馬路，如四川路，江西路等，莫不車輛擁塞，行人擁擠不堪。</p>
<p>各綫乘客益少</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕外灘一帶交通，昨起經當局臨時封鎖後，各綫公共車輛之乘客益見減少。據各綫電車及公共汽車售票員談：近兩三週來所有公共車輛生意均清淡異常，此殆因多數「寫字間」之職工已遭失業或收入減少之故。渠等曾就最近情形略加統計：過去常在一定時間內來去之頭等乘客，現僅有極少數仍保持原狀或已改乘三等，至以前常乘三等者則已改為步行。此種情況尤以法商之電車為甚，座無隙地之景象已早成過去。按公共車輛定價久未調整，卽人力車輛索價普通亦僅在五十萬元以下，但生意俱甚清淡。由此可見市民已習於節儉之一斑。</p>
<h3>國行各業務部門　廿三起遷地辦公</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自外灘一帶禁絕行人交通後，原在外灘一帶之金融機構，營業頗感不便。茲聞中央銀行已決定將該行對外之各業務部門，自廿三日起，遷至靜安寺路九九九號（茂名路口）原屬交通銀行之行址辦公，以利各客戶接洽。至該行對內各部門，則仍留外灘原址辦公云。</p>
<p>外灘禁止通行後，路上冷落，人車絕跡。（本報攝）</p>

<h3>Editorial: How to Channel Idle Capital?</h3>
<p>——A Suggestion for the Authorities to Open Silver Dollar Deposits——</p>
<p>To alleviate the plight of general production enterprises, the Central Bank launched two types of loans a few days ago: one was a temporary direct loan, and the other was a loan for purchasing cotton yarn. As industrial and commercial enterprises teeter on the brink of bankruptcy, these timely loans can truly be called "sending charcoal in the snow." In any case, in principle, they are beyond reproach. However, judging from the market situation in the past two days, they have clearly caused significant changes, especially the loosening of money supply, even to the point of excess, resulting in a hundredfold increase in the value of gold, paper currency, and silver dollars. Taking gold as an example, yesterday's market price exceeded 10 billion, and US dollars have also surpassed 20 million, further indicating that idle capital in Shanghai is stirring. If measures are not taken to channel it early, it may inevitably cause a flood, leading to an irreversible crisis.</p>
<p>In theory, there are many ways to channel idle capital, such as issuing public bonds, promoting savings, selling materials, gold, silver, and silver dollars, selling state-owned assets, establishing investment markets, and encouraging people to invest in real estate. However, at this stage, many of these methods are probably not easy to implement. Even if implemented, they may not be effective. Because the government's credibility has not yet recovered to the pre-war level, the sales aspect is problematic. Promoting savings, at a time when currency value is extremely unstable, unless value-protected deposits that effectively protect the interests of depositors are offered, it is difficult to arouse public interest. Selling gold, silver, silver dollars, and materials is simply impossible. Even if silver dollars are sold, silver dollars are currently huge amounts of paper currency, which would only fuel the momentum of idle capital, with more harm than good. As for establishing investment markets, in the current atmosphere of industrial and commercial recession, it may not be easy to achieve practical results. As for selling state-owned assets and encouraging people to invest in real estate, in this time of war and chaos, it is practically just empty talk. Therefore, discussing channeling idle capital at present is indeed an extremely difficult task. If we cannot stand idly by, we believe that engaging in the business of opening silver dollar deposits is more likely to achieve results.</p>
<p>The silver dollar deposit business was initially piloted by the Gansu Provincial Bank. Later, at the advocacy of academics, it aroused widespread attention in society. The Star Five Symposium of the financial community in this city held on March 11th concentrated on discussion. The results of the meeting mostly agreed that this business, in the current situation of fluctuating currency value, is still an effective countermeasure for channeling idle capital. At the same time, the financial authorities also recognized the role of silver dollar deposits in absorbing idle capital, so they adopted it in the revised new financial reform plan and ordered its implementation throughout the country. As for the authorities in this city, they believe that the situation is special and have postponed implementation. Therefore, the silver dollar deposit business in this city has not yet officially started. However, underground deposits have not only started early but have also become popular. According to the Financial Daily on the 19th, the interest rate is approximately 8 to 10 cents per month, which shows how eager people are for silver dollar deposits.</p>
<p>Now that silver dollars are widely used as chips, the so-called idle capital or excess purchasing power must include silver dollar holders, and should target silver dollar holders. We believe that silver dollars themselves have real value, and people are more likely to be guaranteed when they are requisitioned (i.e., deposited in banks). They will not excessively evade. Moreover, the unit quantity of silver dollar deposits is fundamentally different from that of gold yuan coupons. Absorbing silver dollar deposits is naturally more substantial in terms of quality, which means that the effect of conducting deposits is, of course, quite significant. However, to prevent the mischief of idle capital by emphasizing the convenience of silver dollar deposits and changing the people's tendency to save, it is necessary to pay attention to the technology of silver dollar deposits, the most important of which are the interest rate level, the length of the term, and the price flexibility should conform to the natural level of the market. In short, we feel that this time the bank must effectively guarantee the credit of silver dollar deposits. The credit of silver dollar deposits is the credit of the bank itself. If the bank cannot maintain the credit of deposits, it is equivalent to the collapse of the entire bank. The banking community itself must pay special attention to this. Secondly, it is best to entrust the deposit-absorbing institutions to commercial banks to avoid involvement in political whirlpools. Before the interest is paid, it must be paid in hard currency to enhance credit. As for the fractional amounts, silver dimes have now been introduced. There should be no problem with the collection and payment of units above the dime. For amounts below the dime, which are small, it will not harm the interests of depositors if they are paid in gold yuan coupons at the listed price.</p>
<p>This city is currently in a time of war, and everything needs stability to avoid many unnecessary disturbances. Preventing the mischief of idle capital can not only prevent the surge in prices but also stabilize finance. Now that the storm of idle capital is brewing and about to strike, the authorities must pay attention to preventing it before it happens. As for opening silver dollar deposits, it is only a more concrete and effective countermeasure to prevent the flooding of idle capital at present!</p>
<h3>Frontline Report from Yuepu</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Shi Zhi</p>
<p>Our group then changed to a small road in a fragmented manner. At this time, the planes left, and the sound of artillery rang again! Two hundred meters was such a distant journey at that time. With great difficulty, we walked across a stone bridge and entered a village of about four or five households. In a house with glass windows and a red lacquered Eight Immortals table, we met Commander Guo Yong of a certain division, Commander Zhang Canguang of a certain regiment, and Commander Zou Pengqi of a certain army and Chief of Staff Zhou Yuangen of a certain army who participated in commanding the attack.</p>
<p>It turns out that the positions built by the National Army on the front line are indeed "pocket-shaped positions," including the northernmost ××× via ××× to ×× as one large pocket, ×× via ×××, ×××, ×× as another large pocket; ×× via ××, ×××× to ×× as yet another large pocket. The large pockets are further divided into several small pockets. Due to the strong fortifications of the National Army at the forefront of each Budapest tip, that is, the most prominent points of the National Army positions, such as Shizilin, Yuepu, Yangxing, and Liuhang, and the bravery of the soldiers, and their independent combat spirit, the Communist army has suffered losses of two armies in the past week and has gained nothing.</p>
<p>According to Chief of Staff Yang, on the night of the 17th, a part of the Communist 31st Army continued to attack the National Army's pocket-shaped positions between Yuepu and Yangxing. The National Army positions in Yanjiazhai, more than 100 meters south of this village, were completely destroyed by Communist artillery fire, and Company Commander Zhu Xiangwen led his entire unit to their death. On the 18th, a certain division of Commander Zou Pengqi's army and the original Guo division, along with a part of the tanks, counterattacked forward. Three hours ago, they recovered Yanjiazhai, restored the original positions, and completely annihilated the Communist army that had entered the pocket-shaped positions. Generals Zou and Guo personally came to this front line to supervise the battle.</p>
<p>Since the National Army positions in Yuepu were too prominent, and the battle was still in progress at that time, we could only go to a nearby high ground and look west with binoculars. Yuepu is less than half a kilometer west of here, so in a 10,000x telescope, the dilapidated houses of Yuepu can be seen clearly. The expanse of golden wheat fields, already ripe but unharvested, evokes infinite emotion. According to Director Dai: To take care of the common people, in the past, we could not bear to cut the wheat seedlings that were about to ripen. For the sake of the common people, even though it was for the military's "clearing the field of fire," we still tried our best not to demolish the common people's houses. But we never thought that this would provide the Communist army with the most favorable cover for the attack. Otherwise, the Communist army's casualties would be even greater than they are today. Commander Zhang said, "Until now, there are still more than 2,000 corpses and more than 600 guns on the streets of Yuepu. Both sides avoid casualties, so no one dares to come out to bury them, and no one dares to pick up the guns. A few days ago, when our army conducted a major sweep, we picked up more than 100 guns."</p>
<p>At this time, the sound of artillery rang again. One shell landed in the fields more than 100 meters east of the house. Commander Guo judged from the sound that it was a Communist field gun. He said, "It's really lively here every day after sunset!" Then he asked me, "Are you afraid?" I replied, "With you here, I'm not afraid!"</p>
<p>In my conversation with Commander Zou, I learned that the former commander of that army, Hu Changqing, was wounded in the chest by a bullet in the Battle of Xuancheng on April 24th and is now recuperating in Taiwan, but his life is not in danger. At about the same time, Yang Sensen's commander, Yang Cancai, a famous general from Sichuan, died valiantly in the Battle of Wanzhi. Hu and I were new acquaintances. Last winter, when touring the scenic Langya Ancient Temple in Chuxian County, he treated me to a meal. Yang can be called a close friend. He quoted as a military precept: "A chisel cannot be separated from brothers, and an expedition cannot be separated from father and son." Every time I think of it, I am fascinated. Today, learning the news of one being injured and one dying in battle, my mood is quite complex and heavy.</p>
<p>On the way back after bidding farewell to Generals Zou and Guo, the sound of machine guns gradually faded away, but the artillery of both sides continued to roar. We were traveling in the dead angle formed by the arc of the artillery shells fired by both sides, but occasionally Communist shells landed near us. Therefore, we all dispersed with caution and fear, choosing low-lying paths to move forward. Along the way, I saw plump and solid soybeans that no one harvested, and golden wheat ears hanging low, but no one harvested them. In all the houses, near and far, that we passed, there was not a wisp of smoke, not a single common person. Section Chief Wang told me: This year is indeed a good year here, but the people in the war zone have indeed done their best to help the country, so he once suggested to Commissioner Gu Zhenggang when he went to the front: The houses in Shanghai that are used as "higher-level refugees" going to Hong Kong and Taiwan should be given to this group of truly homeless refugees, otherwise the burden that this war places on the people would be too unfair. Commissioner Gu agreed with his view, but believed that the problem was that there were too many difficulties in implementation.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, probably after walking at least three or four kilometers, we stepped onto the Bao (Shan) Wu (Song) Highway. Here, we saw machines used to open mountains doing construction, groups of stretcher teams and truck teams transporting wounded soldiers heading south, and tank teams heading north. Artillery teams arranged on the side of the highway were firing west.</p>
<p>On the side of the highway, I found that our jeep was waiting in a ten-wheeled truck used to pull artillery. Finally, we had initially concluded this most arduous journey. Everyone got into the jeep. In the car, I asked the driver Chai if he was afraid. He said: No, he drove for the newspaper during the Battle of August 13th. Section Chief Wang also told me: "After the Battle of Shanghai, the Associated Press once sent someone to ride in a tank to report from the battlefield, but when it approached the front line, the first tank in the lead was hit and injured by a Communist flat-trajectory gun. Therefore, the tank in which the foreign reporter was sitting could only drag the injured tank back to the rear halfway! The Shanghai News should be the pioneer of reporters running into dangerous scenes on the battlefield." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Bevin and Acheson Arrive in Paris; Britain, America, and France to Hold Talks; Review Joint Countermeasures on the German Question</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union all departed for Paris today to prepare for the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which opens on the 23rd. US Secretary of State Acheson is scheduled to depart from Washington by plane tonight and will arrive in Paris in time to hold talks with the British and French foreign ministers before the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference to unify the three powers' steps in the meeting. A dispatch from Moscow said that Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will also leave the Soviet capital for Paris within 24 hours. When British Foreign Secretary Bevin left London this morning, he told reporters about the possible outcome of the conference, saying, "It's all up to God." With no more than 48 hours to the opening of the conference, all Europeans are calling for the meeting to be convened with tension, which was decided by the four powers in New York recently when they agreed to lift the Berlin blockade.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] Senior diplomatic officials from the United States, Britain, and France here have completed a series of strategic negotiations today in preparation for the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. They are currently awaiting the arrival of British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 20th and US Secretary of State Acheson on the 21st in Paris. The three countries' representatives have held seven secret meetings. It is reported that the representatives have drafted a complete plan to enable Acheson, Bevin, and Schuman to agree with Vyshinsky.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 19th] The British Cabinet on the 19th gave full power to Foreign Secretary Bevin, allowing Bevin to reject any proposals in the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference that would allow the Soviet Union to control Germany. It is reported that the British Cabinet has also decided to reject any proposals for German economic unification based on the equal value of marks issued in the East and West. Foreign Secretary Bevin led a delegation of 50 people and left for Paris by train on the 20th. The British Cabinet meeting on the 19th was a comprehensive review of the possible situations that may arise in the Paris meeting.</p>
<h3>Acheson Explains Diplomatic Policy; United States Congress Fully Supports; Plan to Rebuild West Germany Will Never Be Abandoned</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said tonight that the committee fully supports Acheson's position on resolving the German issue and said that Acheson has obtained full support from the Senate when he goes to Paris.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Secretary of State Acheson is scheduled to fly to Paris tomorrow to attend the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Today, he gave a detailed report on US foreign policy in a secret meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Afterwards, he issued a statement stating that the United States' policy of rebuilding democracy in West Germany will not change, and it will not yield to the Soviet Union in the Paris meeting, allowing its power to expand to West Germany.</p>
<p>Acheson also warned that the outcome of the four-country meeting is pessimistic, and no one can predict it. There is no need to be pessimistic about its results, and there is no need to have extravagant hopes for the material. US foreign policy is firm and consistent. If it is believed that there is a slight preliminary success, and the work of building a free world is no longer intensified, it will inevitably lead to tragedy. However, he continued, this meeting may have a better chance of reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union on the unification of Germany than previous meetings. In short, we hope to reach an agreement no matter what, and we have no intention of sacrificing the achievements we have already made or "hindering their future progress." Acheson also explained the outline of US foreign policy, saying, "We should have the determination not to shift with the rise and fall of international temperatures to avoid the Soviet Union manipulating our country's diplomatic relations. The purpose of adjusting our country's diplomatic policy is to obtain a world of peace and security, which has been the case in the past and will certainly be the main donkey in the future."</p>
<h3>Differing Positions of Major Powers on Promoting German Unification</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Among the Western three countries participating in the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, Britain is more confident that it is more willing than the United States and France for Germany to achieve unification at this time. The connection between the British Labor government and the German Social Democratic Party in belief can be said to be consistent. Therefore, it is believed that under the leadership of the German Social Democratic Party, a unified Germany will be able to devote itself to the reconstruction of Europe without threatening the safety of neighboring countries. The British also feel that although Britain, the United States, and France are all willing for Germany to achieve unification under specific conditions, the United States does not currently intend to support full German unification measures. First, the United States is deeply afraid that the establishment of a unified German economic system will give the German Communist Party the opportunity to obstruct the reconstruction of West Germany. Furthermore, the United States is also opposed to the public ownership of the Ruhr region and other German heavy industries. If Germany's economic power is controlled by the Social Democratic Party or the Communist Party, the possibility of establishing such public ownership will be greater. France's opposition to Germany's too rapid unification is entirely based on security reasons. The British believe that most French people still advocate that Germany should remain divided for a long time. At the same time, some experts predict that the Soviet Union will make major concessions at the Foreign Ministers' Conference to promote German unification, thus deliberately threatening France to create tension within the Atlantic nations.</p>
<h3>Three Powers Reach Agreement on West German Election Law</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 19th] An official here claimed: After the French government reluctantly decided to approve the election law of the West German Federal Parliament, the Allied countries have reached an agreement on the election law. When the French government approved the law, it raised several reservations, stating that some powers reserved by the constituent assembly should be exercised by the state premier after the parliament is dissolved and the constitution is promulgated. The deputy military governors of the Western three powers met in Berlin today to draft a joint letter to the West German state premiers to inform them of this decision.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Munich, 20th] The Bavarian Parliament recently voted 101 to 64, with nine abstentions, rejecting the West German constitution drafted by the Bonn Parliament. Of the eleven federal states in West Germany, four federal parliaments have already passed the Bonn Constitution. The constitution requires the approval of two-thirds of the federations. Bavaria is the first federation to reject the constitution. However, the Bavarian Parliament decided that if the other two-thirds of the federations pass the constitution, the Bavarian Parliament will also accept it. At the same time, the Bavarian Parliament unanimously passed a proposal requesting the US military government to submit the German constitution issue to a popular vote.</p>
<h3>British Views on the Future Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>It is believed that there may not be major gains</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The British public seems largely indifferent to the gains of the current Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. Due to the prolonged Cold War, and the austerity plan at home has restricted the people in every way, the most concerned by the general public is how to obtain enough cigarettes and how to spend the holidays comfortably. Few newspapers, except for the "Daily Mail" and "The Times," mention the Paris meeting. The "Daily Mail" believes that the lifting of the blockade is not a Soviet concession or a display of goodwill, so it hopes that Western countries will be wary. "The Times" predicts that the most the Foreign Ministers' Conference will achieve is to make Germany form a loose federation with two units, to accommodate the existing facts between East and West Germany. Its central institutions will only make Germany tend to unify economically. Government officials' opinions can be divided into two factions: one faction believes that the Soviet Union's concession is just a kind of propaganda for the Germans; the other faction believes that the Soviet Union has to make concessions. In order to gain a foothold in the control of the Ruhr area, the Soviet Union may agree not to demand in-kind compensation from Germany.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Temporarily Opens Helmstedt Highway</h3>
<p>Trucks from Hamburg to Berlin are Blocked Again</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 19th] The Soviet Union temporarily lifted the blockade on the Helmstedt Highway on the 19th, allowing trucks that had been blocked for 42 hours to enter Berlin, but at the same time, the Soviet Union began to block trucks traveling from Hamburg to Berlin. The Western Allied authorities are bewildered and furious at the Soviet Union's obstruction tactics. The opening of the Helmstedt Highway was realized within minutes after the British occupying army's chief of staff, Weisdelorub, lodged a protest with the Soviet side, but the Soviet side did not give any explanation.</p>
<h3>Matthews Appointed Secretary of the Navy; US Senate Approves</h3>

According to Anderson, director of the headquarters' prisoner of war repatriation division, it is estimated that 408,729 Japanese prisoners of war still remain in the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>US Army and Navy to Hold Major Exercises in Hawaii This Fall</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 19th] The Army Department recently announced that major army and navy exercises will be held on the island of Hawaii this fall, under the overall command of General Clark.

<h3>Nepal Applies to Join the United Nations; Soviet Union Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 19th] When the United Nations Security Council's Committee on the Admission of New Members reviewed Nepal's application to join the United Nations today, the Soviet representative expressed opposition. He said that based on the information he knew, he was not satisfied that Nepal was a sovereign and independent country, so he advocated not discussing Nepal's application for the time being, pending more detailed information being obtained. He also pointed out that the treaty signed between Britain and Nepal in 1923 actually only made Nepal completely obey Britain and did not give Nepal the sovereignty of foreign relations. Ukrainian representative Garaga also supported the Soviet Union's position, pointing out that Nepal's foreign exchange is completely controlled by India. China, Britain, the United States, France, Egypt, Norway, Canada, and other countries all supported Nepal's application. Chairman and French representative Rose said that Nepal's representative is now in New York. He suggested that the committee ask the representative to provide full information on all treaties signed between Nepal and Britain. The Soviet representative still expressed his doubts about whether the committee has the right to request this information. He advocated that the committee report to the Security Council, stating that the information obtained on Nepal was not sufficient, and then the Security Council should decide what measures to take.</p>
<h3>Soviet Suggestion for Three-Power Discussion on the Greek Situation Rejected Outright by the US and UK; Insistence that Resolution Be Sought Within the United Nations; UK Expresses Unwillingness to Create a "Second Munich"</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Washington, 20th Broadcast: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 20th, rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal to resolve the Greek civil war outside the United Nations, and stated that the United States welcomes the Soviet Union's goodwill measures to end Communist support for the rebel army to resolve the Greek civil war.

<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 20th Broadcast: The British Foreign Office recently announced that the UK rejects the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a three-power conference to resolve the Greek issue. A Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the UK is unwilling to violate the will of the Greek government and sacrifice Greece, creating a second Munich.</p>
<h3>US Halts Japanese Reparations; China and the Philippines Express Dissent; Gu Weijun Criticizes Conflict with International Agreements</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 19th Dispatch] Representatives from China and the Philippines expressed dissent today regarding the United States' position presented to the Far Eastern Commission on May 12 concerning Japanese reparations and industrial levels.</p>
<p>Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun adopted a reserved stance regarding his government's position, stating that the Chinese government's position will be formally announced in the next meeting of the Far Eastern Commission. However, he also stated: "The Chinese government is deeply disappointed to learn that the United States has suddenly changed its position on the important issue of demanding reparations from Japan... We believe that these views conflict with a series of dignified international agreements and resolutions." Gu stated: The United States' opinion does not consider the security of the Pacific and is inconsistent with the basic principles and goals of the occupation of Japan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th Dispatch] Philippine representative Romulo today strongly criticized the United States' decision to stop shipping Japanese reparations in the Far Eastern Commission. It is claimed that: "This move is tantamount to restoring Japan's war-making capabilities. Japanese zaibatsu are undermining the United States' efforts to revive the Japanese economy, proving to cause sympathy from the U.S. and ensure U.S. assistance. The biggest reason the U.S. stopped transporting reparations is to reduce the burden on American taxpayers to supply Japan, but most of this burden is caused by the Japanese not being able to help themselves, especially the zaibatsu manipulating behind the scenes. The Japanese zaibatsu want to rise again and must revive the army and navy. We must stop this ambition in time. To date, most of the Japanese reparations shipped to the Philippines, the United Kingdom, China, and the Netherlands are mother machines and other equipment, worth a total of approximately $170 million, and no factories have been dismantled. The Philippine government still hopes that the Far Eastern Commission can establish a fair and satisfactory solution to the reparations issue."</p>

<h3>Crisis Brewing in the French Cabinet; Independent Conservatives Oppose Financial Measures</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 20th Dispatch] The "rebellion" of independent conservative members in the French cabinet has threatened the collapse of the Guy cabinet, which has been in place for eight months. Minister of Economy Pinet and Mayor of Aviation Molu told the 35 members of parliament of their party that they firmly opposed the government's measures to deal with the 850 billion budget shortfall. They believe that the government's existing financial bill is completely contrary to the price stability policy. Parliamentary sources believe that the expression of these two cabinet members has caused political tension, but they still believe that Prime Minister Guy can hope to obtain a compromise plan to avoid the financial bill being rejected when it is submitted to parliament for debate.</p>

<h3>Social Bureau Plans to Accommodate Refugees; Negotiating to Borrow the Great World; Four Refugee Shelters to Be Set Up in the Urban Area</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, our reporter interviewed Director Chen of the Social Bureau, asking about the measures taken by the bureau to provide relief to refugees during the Battle for Greater Shanghai. According to Director Chen, the municipal government is actively handling relief for refugees from the suburbs who have sought refuge in the city due to the war. More than 1,000 citizens in the Longhua District sought refuge in the city. Senators Zhang Xuelian and District Chief Yang Jishi allocated 200 shi of rice from the Social Bureau for relief. The Pudong Fellow Villagers Association still has 300 shi of rice in storage, which can last for a period of time. The refugee reception location is planned to borrow the Great World Amusement Park, which is being negotiated by the Garrison Department and the Great World. Four refugee shelters will be set up in the urban area to accommodate refugees in groups. The four districts of Jiangwan, Dachang, Wusong, and Xinshi form one group. Zhenru and Beixinjing form one group. In Pudong, Gaoqiao, Yangjing, and Sisheng form one group. Longhua District forms a separate group. Currently, Renji Hall on Yunnan Road has begun to accommodate refugees. Director Chen finally hoped for two points: (1) Hope that the Garrison Department will quickly solve the problem of housing for refugees. (2) Hope that those with money will contribute money so that the refugee relief work can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a senior official of the Social Bureau said: (1) The Social Bureau, together with the United Relief Committee and various charitable organizations, has already accommodated more than 6,000 refugees.

(3) For refugees who have not sought refuge in the city and are still outside Mucheng, the Social Bureau has allocated 1,000 shi of rice and entrusted it to the district offices in the suburbs for relief. The number of people will be reported by the district offices in the suburbs. The transportation problem is being negotiated with the Garrison Department.</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Listing Unchanged; Exchange Rate Shrinks Sharply</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's silver dollar market conditions, because the Central Bank's listing did not move, the dark market trend rose along with the gold and banknote rate. All general businesses stopped doing business, and the yellow cattle on the road were buying in, forming a situation where they only buy in and do not sell out, and the shouting price became more chaotic.</p>

<h3>Market Transactions in Chaos: Gold Prices Skyrocket</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the gold market, due to the overall situation, saw agitated sentiment. External factors were favorable, and market conditions were extremely chaotic. Several gold firms suspended trading one after another. As usual, the market inside hit the upper limit, rising again to 7.96266 billion, with demand exceeding supply and still facing stagnation. Off-exchange prices were quoted without any standard, skyrocketing, but with very few transactions, as no one was willing to sell, creating a one-sided buying spree. The morning opened at 7.5 billion and 7.8 billion, with no action from the Central Bank. In an instant, it surged through three levels. After ten o'clock, it had passed the 10 billion mark, reaching a peak of 11 billion or 12 billion. The midday price was 10.5 billion or 11.5 billion. The afternoon's rise was even more severe, climbing from 11.5 billion or 12.5 billion all the way to 12 billion or 13 billion at closing, a sharp jump of 5 billion compared to the 5th, a surge of 70%.</p>

It is said that the street vendors selling real silver recently are asking for only four silver dollars for an entire silver table setup, but there are still few inquiries.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Promotion Committee: Introduction to Simple Cultivation Methods</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Municipal Government's Vegetable Promotion Committee, in order to encourage the promotion of various vegetables on public and private vacant land in the urban area, has specially introduced various vegetables suitable for summer planting and their simple cultivation methods, for citizens to refer to when choosing seeds. If there are any questions regarding planting techniques, you can directly write to the Garden Management Office of the Bureau of Public Works at No. 2 Huangzha Road, Shanghai, to be forwarded to the committee for detailed answers.</p>
<p>(1) Chinese Cabbage: Can be sown at any time and harvested after half a month. Broadcasting or row sowing can be used. Before sowing the seeds, first loosen the soil. If the weather is dry, water once or twice after sowing and covering the soil. When two or three small leaves have grown after germination, apply decomposed manure water once. After half a month, when four or five leaves have grown, it can be harvested.</p>
<p>(2) Amaranth: The cultivation method is the same as Chinese cabbage. After ten days of germination, the seedlings can be harvested by pulling them out with the roots. If the seedlings grow to four or five inches long, pick the tender shoots for food. The roots can still be left in the soil to sprout new shoots for consumption. With continuous picking like this, it is only necessary to pay attention to applying manure water once every half month and irrigating once a day. After planting, it can continuously supply food for three months.</p>
<p>(3) Cabbage (i.e., head cabbage): Use ready-made seedlings and transplant them into garden plots that have been made into ridges. The distance between rows and between plants should both be about one foot and five inches. Other fertilization and irrigation are the same as for Chinese cabbage. After one month, the tender leaves can be harvested. After two months, it begins to form heads, and after another month, the heads can be picked for consumption.</p>
<p>(4) Cowpeas: Use cultivated seedlings and transplant them into the garden, or directly sow the seeds in the garden. Both cultivation methods should use three or four seedlings per plant. The distance between plants should be one and a half feet. After sowing and germination, if too many seedlings sprout, the weak seedlings can be removed as appropriate. When the seedlings grow to one foot tall, set up frames for them to climb. Subsequent fertilization and irrigation are the same as for Chinese cabbage. After two or three months, the pods can be picked for consumption.</p>
<p>(5) Green-skinned Winter Melon: Bury five or six seeds in each hole. When the weather is dry, water once or twice a day. After germination, remove the weak seedlings, leaving two or three seedlings per hole. Pay attention to fertilization and irrigation afterward, and it can be harvested after two and a half months.</p>
<p>(6) Eggplant: The cultivation method is the same as cowpeas. It can be harvested after two months.</p>
<p>(7) Soybean: The cultivation method is the same as cowpeas. Edamame can be harvested after two and a half months. It becomes soybeans after three months.</p>
<p>(8) Sword Bean: The cultivation method is the same as soybeans. However, it is advisable to build a fence frame for them to climb. The maturity period is the same as cowpeas.</p>
<p>(9) Four-season Radish: The cultivation method is the same as Chinese cabbage. The leaves and roots of young plants can be eaten. After forty or fifty days, the roots become enlarged and can be pulled out individually for consumption.</p>
<h3>China Hospital Expands Free Clinic</h3>

<h3>The Bund is Absolutely Prohibited to Traffic; Ships are Concentrated Outside Wusongkou; Mao Sen Issued an Emergency Order Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Police Chief Mao Sen issued four emergency orders at noon yesterday, ordering his subordinates to strictly implement them: (1) "Chevaux de frise" should be set up at the entrances of all roads along the Bund to block them. Except for trams and military vehicles, other vehicles and personnel are absolutely prohibited from passing. (2) Ships berthed on the Huangpu River, regardless of size, must all sail to Wusongkou for concentration before 12:00 last night. (3) Crew members of ships that cannot sail must not stay on board and must all disembark. (4) The Dongjiadu area in Nanshi has a complex population. Additional police officers should be sent to investigate.</p>
<h3>The True Picture of Peace in Beiping (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>The main purpose of this entry ceremony was to demonstrate strength, to let the people of Beiping see that they had so many troops and such good weapons. In the end, the goal was achieved. Many foreign reporters were surprised after seeing it, especially American friends. Seeing the 15mm howitzers, armored vehicles, and tanks that they had equipped the National Army with to defend against the Soviet Union now all adorned with bright Soviet flags, their frustration was imaginable. But the next day, I heard from friends in the 3rd Armored Regiment that the 28 armored vehicles, 6 tanks, and 2 15mm howitzers used in the entry ceremony were all borrowed from the National Army. They were borrowed on the morning of the 2nd. The national emblem was temporarily brushed off and replaced with a painted five-pointed red star. They paraded ostentatiously for a day, and on the afternoon of the 4th, the national emblem was repainted and returned. Although I don't know how much they got in the Northeast, what they boasted about in Beiping was borrowed to put on a show. But this inside story is known to only a few people, and their purpose of demonstrating strength was ultimately achieved, especially to foreign friends.</p>
<p>Having described the main characters, I will now report on some of the supporting characters. The main supporting characters were the art troupes formed by the Communist Party from various departments. They appeared on the streets at 8 o'clock in the morning, dressed in strange and varied costumes, each with their own ideas. But nine out of ten of them were led by portraits of Mao and Soviet flags, with a few powdered and made-up "war criminals" in the middle ranks, followed by men and women in paper-wrapped heads and red headscarves, twisting and turning forward in a Yangge dance, and then the cheering crowds waving flags. The most eye-catching was the National Changchun University. They made a large wooden turtle, with four wheels as its four feet. The turtle's head was inlaid with white. A president whom they had once shouted "Long Live" for, adorned with a turtle shell, was sitting on the back of the turtle, wearing a Stars and Stripes hat. Li Zongren, Chen Cheng, Sun Ke, and Chen Lifu, four war criminals, were biting it from all sides. Each of them had a sign stuck on their back saying "Execute war criminal so-and-so." Li and Chen were in glittering military uniforms, Sun was in a sharp suit, and Chen was in a blue robe. The first two were squatting, and the latter two were pushing. This art troupe was especially praised by the People's Daily the next day, which considered their design novel and their technique superb. The slogans that the crowds were taught to shout were roughly the following: (1) Welcome the People's Liberation Army, (2) Celebrate the liberation of Beiping, (3) Carry out the revolution to the end, (4) Smash the peace conspiracy, (5) The peace conspiracy is a cheap commodity made by the United States, (6) Down with the peace politicians, (7) Attack Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, (8) Insist on Chairman Mao's eight conditions.</p>
<p>February 12th, i.e., the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, was the Beiping citizens' celebration of the liberation of Beiping. This celebration was organized by several so-called pseudo-senators, who had been brewing peace before the liberation, and the original pseudo-bao-jia heads of the city, with the aim of flattering the Communist Party and expressing loyalty. At the beginning of the preparations, they did not contact the Communist Party beforehand. The Communist Party was busy with the takeover in those days and did not pay attention to it. Who knew that when it was almost time, the People's Daily suddenly pointed to this preparer as "CC," i.e., a special agent. It also said that they had not obtained permission from the authorities to prepare for this meeting and were not allowed to prepare. They were trying to flatter, but they tripped up. After much pleading, the Communist Party took over the organization, and the meeting was held as scheduled. The night before, the bao-jia heads notified each household to send a representative to gather at the designated location at 9 o'clock in the morning for a roll call. At that time, schools had not yet opened, so the principals were notified to bring the students to participate in the meeting. This meeting was held in Tiananmen Square. By 10 o'clock in the morning, it was crowded with people, and Soviet flags were flying. But everyone who participated knew how everyone came to be there. At 10:30, "the people of Beiping's own mayor," Ye Jianying, gave a speech. He first praised the Beiping-style peace, shouted a few "Long Live this, Long Live that" slogans, and then emphasized that the Communist Party would never be deceived, would never accept the disguised peace directed by the United States, and firmly advocated that Chairman Mao's eight conditions must be met before peace could be discussed. Finally, he announced that the task of the Beiping People's Government during the military control period was: (1) To completely eliminate the counter-revolutionary forces lurking in the city, (2) To establish a revolutionary regime, (3) To take over various agencies, (4) To build a new democratic order, (5) To dissolve the Kuomintang, the Social Democratic Party, the Youth Party, and all reactionary parties and groups, (6) To arrest war criminals and reactionaries at all levels. Many people, while listening respectfully, were secretly shivering. After the meeting, there was a parade. I saw many friends who were principals on the roadside, pulling long faces, holding a small red flag in their hands, and leading students who had not yet eaten breakfast and lunch, shouting "The peace conspiracy is a cheap commodity made by the United States" weakly. The large turtle, a masterpiece, reappeared, and the art troupes of the Communist Party from various departments danced the Yangge again, but people were already used to it, and there were far fewer onlookers on the roadside. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Drastic Reduction in Supply, Vegetable Prices Soar, Request to Allow Transportation Awaits Approval from the Authorities</h3>
<p>[East China News Agency] Due to the war, the supply of various vegetables has been drastically reduced. Yesterday, market prices rose sharply across the board. Pork was 12 million yuan per catty, yellow croaker was 4 million yuan per catty, broad beans and green vegetables were 600,000 yuan per catty, and pickled vegetables were 800,000 yuan per catty, all rising by one to three times compared to the previous day. Wang Dajun, Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, said: "Yesterday, the intense fighting in Pudong and other places affected the source of vegetables in the city, causing market prices to soar. This is of great importance to the people's livelihood. The vegetable market is requesting the Municipal Government to allow the transportation of vegetables from the suburbs, which is currently awaiting approval from the highest military authorities."</p>
<h3>Chairman Fang of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee Calls on Citizens to Defend Greater Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee, in order to awaken citizens' awareness of defending Greater Shanghai and to launch a campaign to raise funds to support the military, broadcast a speech on the Kaixuan Radio Station yesterday, titled "Defend Greater Shanghai." The original text is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Compatriots: At this critical moment when the suburbs of Shanghai are filled with the sounds of artillery fire and the fight for victory, while the front lines are intensifying the offensive and fighting, the order in the urban area must be maintained calmly and steadily. We must not listen to rumors and cause mutual panic. We must know that the three Commanders-in-Chief of the National Army, Navy, and Air Force are stationed in Shanghai, supervising this sacred war to suppress the bandits. Their purpose is to defend Shanghai. Therefore, we can only achieve this goal by working together with the military and civilians, with one heart and one mind, to jointly maintain the security of the urban area and protect public utilities and production enterprises. Those who take the opportunity to cause trouble, spread rumors, and confuse the public are the common enemies of all citizens of our city. The local government and military organs should kill these scoundrels without mercy. Because without doing so, we cannot pacify the internal situation, and without pacifying the internal situation, we cannot suppress the bandits. I hope that all compatriots from all walks of life will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>The Riverside Road is Sealed Off, Turning the Bustle into Desolation; The Starting and Ending Stations of Public Vehicles on Various Lines are Changed</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In order to strengthen the security of the urban area, the Songhu Garrison Command has sealed off the riverside road from Fuxing Island to Nanmatou from yesterday. As a result, the usually bustling Bund has been transformed into a quiet and desolate place. Military police are stationed at the Waibaidu Bridge and the intersections of various roads leading to the Bund, prohibiting the passage of ordinary vehicles and pedestrians. The high-rise buildings along the Bund are tightly closed, and people enter and exit through the back doors or side doors leading to the north-south roads. All trams and buses passing through the Bund have changed their starting and ending stations. Buses Nos. 9 and 10 have shortened their routes and are turning around on Nanjing Road Central Road, No. 3 is turning around at the Bund on Avenue Edward VII, No. 14 is turning around at the intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road, and Nos. 4 and 11 are using Tiantong Road as their terminus. Tram No. 2's terminus has been changed to the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road. Tram Nos. 7, 8, 10, and 11 all use the northern end of Waibaidu Bridge as their terminus. Passengers traveling from north to south must get off at that point, and then the empty car travels across the bridge to the Bund on Wuma Road to turn around and return. Passengers going to Hongkou board the bus at the northern end of Waibaidu Bridge. Only Tram No. 1 can still carry passengers through the Bund, but the Bund stops have been changed to the entrance of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road and the northern end of Waibaidu Bridge. Due to the rerouting of various vehicles and the change in the relationship between the upper and lower stations, the roads near the Bund, such as Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road, are all congested with vehicles and crowded with pedestrians.</p>
<p>Fewer Passengers on Each Line</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the transportation on the Bund was temporarily blocked by the authorities yesterday, the number of passengers on various public transport lines decreased even further. According to the ticket sellers on various tram and bus lines: "Business on all public vehicles has been extremely slow in the past two or three weeks. This is probably because most of the employees in the 'offices' have been unemployed or have reduced incomes." They have made a rough estimate of the recent situation: "The first-class passengers who used to travel at certain times now only a very few maintain the original status or have changed to third class, and those who used to travel in third class have changed to walking." This situation is especially true for the French-owned trams, and the scene of no empty seats has long passed. Although the prices of public vehicles have not been adjusted for a long time, and the prices charged by rickshaws are also usually only below 500,000 yuan, business is very slow. This shows that citizens have become accustomed to thrift.</p>
<h3>National Bank's Various Business Departments to Relocate Offices from the 23rd</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since pedestrian traffic has been banned in the Bund area, it has been quite inconvenient for financial institutions originally located in the Bund area to conduct business. It is reported that the Central Bank has decided to move its external business departments to No. 999 Jing'an Temple Road (at the intersection of Maoming Road), the original site of the Bank of Communications, from the 23rd onwards, in order to facilitate contact with customers. The internal departments of the bank will remain at the original address on the Bund.</p>
<p>After the Bund was closed to traffic, the roads were deserted, with no people or vehicles in sight. (Photo by our newspaper)</p>
