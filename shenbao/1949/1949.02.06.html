<h3>政院開始在穗辦公　明日下午舉行院務會議　立監兩院長赴廣州視察</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州五日電〕行政院五日正式開始在穗辦公。上午孫院長與吳副院長邀集立院副院長劉健羣，在穗立法委負，省市參會議長等，垂詢粵省治安，經濟情况，並徽詢對時局意見。下午邀南來各部會首長談話，指示一切。孫氏並定六日招待記者。另據關係方面息：孫氏昨抵此後，卽邀集軍政首長會談，參加者有余漢謀，薛岳，張發奎，劉紀文等，內容未公布。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州五日電〕行政院定七日參加在紀念堂舉行之擴大紀念週會後，赴黃花崗恭謁七十二烈士墓，下午四時舉行院務會議。孫院長，吳副院長並定六日上午十時在市府迎賓館邀請留穗立。監委員及國民黨中央執監委員座談。又中常會定八日上午在穗樂行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於孫院長赴穗後，外界所引起之政局謠言，據甘介侯表示，本月三日曾奉命謁見孫院長，孫氏當時謂「不能不去廣州一次，一則因已通知外交團遷廣州，各國使館南遷，且有大使或公使已抵廣州者，在禮貌上當去穗一行。同時在廣州有幾件事，非親往辦理不可，惟日內卽將返京」。在事實上，立法院已決定在京開會，行政院在憲法上應對立法院負責，部會首長須作施政報吿及答覆質詢，自不能分設兩地，在精神上，亦需在同一地點，方能負責，故行政院自必遷返南京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕立法院長童冠賢，監察院長于右任定六日上午十時由京專機飛穗，兩院長此行目的，在明瞭政院南遷後之廣州情形，並促孫院長返京。聞兩氏三五日內亦將返京。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州五日電〕據立院副院長劉健羣稱：童院長何時來穗現尙未悉，立院第三會期依憲法二月中旬舉行，若政府南遷，開會地點當在穗。劉氏末以樂觀語調稱：中國一切都有辦法。</p>
<h3>立院準備在穗復會　留滬監委不滿政院南遷</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕立法院秘書長陳克文，五日晨由滬乘車返京，據語記者，立院集會日期，地點，目前尙難預定，惟立院職員大多離京，故在京召開恐不可能。據渠統計，立委在滬者最多達百數十人，廣州次之，在桂·台·京等地者亦不少，將來何時在何地開會，仍須徵求多數立委意見及時局發展情形而定。陳氏日前赴滬，係發放在滬立委公費，日內將赴穗·桂一行，惟行期未定。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州五日電〕立法院遷穗集會，上月杪副院長劉建羣，副秘書長延國符率同職員到穗後，積極籌備，經洽定中山紀念堂為開會地點，文德路中山圖書館及觀音山仲元岡書館為辦公處，並包定旅店供委員住宿，每委員可分得住房一間，所有復會事務，均已準備就緒，各地立委亦已有四十餘人報到，其餘正紛紛來穗。據副秘書長稱：一俟立委足法定人數，卽行復會</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕留滬監委於五日上午九時假蘇浙監委行署舉行座談會，出席副院長劉哲，監委居正，楊虎，劉平江，倪弼等五十餘人，推王向辰主席，討論主題集中於促進和平及政府遷移問題。多數監委對行政院之遷穗表示不滿，咸主監院為促成和平早日實現，不應隨政府遷移，二月份院會仍定十五日在京舉行。座談會決定設和平問題研究委員會，推劉平江，陶百川，倪弼等七人主持商討促進和平具體步驟，至午始吿散會。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕留滬監察委員四十餘人，昨舉行談話會，對孫院長令各部首長南遷，擾亂政務人心，將正式予以糾舉。</p>
<h3>榕將成經濟重心　財次楊道樾等先後到達　各使館先頭人員紛抵穗</h3>
<p>〔本報福州五日電〕目前種種跡象，顯示福州將成一經濟重心，財部次長楊道樾，國庫署長王撫洲·鹽務總局長李儻，均先後搭機抵榕，中國農民銀行總行已覓址市上籐路興修行舍，另有公私銀行大批計劃遷閩中，民間盛傳財部遷閩南平辦公。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州五日電〕近來首都撤退去粵桂者極衆，而浙贛路人車擁擠已超過飽和量，現公路可通者一由杭徽路至屯溪，經景德鎭入贛，此綫治安較差，一由淳安轉道江山。上饒而抵南昌，此路軍車日逾百輛，由南昌去湘桂粵均暢通。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州五日電〕最近各國駐京使館紛紛派遣先頭人員來穗，覓址辦公，查已抵達此間者，計有美公使克拉克。英大使館參事高祿賀·法大使館參事羅賀海，澳國大使館一等秘書李貴漿·義國大使館參事計必果·荷國大使館參事魏懋庠·印度大使館一等秘書栗南。捷克大使館商尼，緬甸大使館二等秘書吳辟·及蘇大使羅申及其隨員等，各國使館在未覓妥館址以前，多在愛羣酒店暫住，我外交部特派禮賓司王敬賢負責招待。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓四日合衆電〕國務院今宣稱，美駐華使館職員十三人，刻已隨國民政府自南京遷往廣州，司徒雷登大使及其僚屬卅九人與彼等家眷六人，則仍留駐南京，又遷穗人員係由克拉克公使率領前往。</p>
<p>〔聯合社廣州五日電〕南下要人正忙於找尋房屋，省府與市府當局勉强盡地主之誼，南遷之政府尙無活動之象。今日又有九國使館人員目南京抵此，外交部駐粵辦事處昨夜首次正式招待外賓，美國大使館辦事處設在沙面新屋中，尙在裝修，惟美國公使克拉克與大使館職員今日已開始辦公。</p>
<h3>總統印仍在京</h3>

<h3>丁治磐談和運</h3>
<p>局部和平實無異投降</p>
<p>京滬不能為第二北平</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江五日電〕丁治磐主席今在記者招待會中，闡述渠對和平之看法。渠首先笑稱：「因為我是軍人，目然我希望打下去。」但此語旋卽被解釋為「戲言」。渠認為由於共黨態度强橫，和談前途殊未能樂觀。丁氏於散會後，亦頻對本報記者談目前局面，實屬和比戰難，並謂渠有凖備做鄭成功·史可法之信念。記者以目前在醞釀中之京滬局部和平運動相詢，丁氏答以局部和平無異投降，北平可為殷鑒。丁氏對京滬局部和平之觀點，為由於人民對和平之希望較切，與局部和平之符合共黨企圖分化政府力量之陰謀，故此說甚可能為共方接受；惟此僅限於共黨，以人民方面為談判對象，在軍方立塲則在政府主權國家利益之大前提下，決不能坐視京滬兩地淪為北平第二。關於江防問題，丁氏稱，南京以下江面有近百艘之艦艇經常巡弋，且京滬綫駐軍實力有十餘個軍，故江防當無問題，但此非謂共軍決不能渡江，千餘人以下之小部隊，隨時可以「偷渡」，故渠最近正針對此點，在江南地區積極展開民衆組訓工作。</p>
<h3>南京人民和平代表團　今日由青島飛平　團員十一人名單已發表</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島五日電〕京人民和平代表團五日晨與北平聯合辦事處通話，經周北峯轉吿葉劍英氏對昨日通知事項略有修正（一）六日下午二時起飛來平，（二）在西苑機塲降落，（三）帶足回程汽油，（四）飛至北平上空時，始開放電合聯絡，（五）絕對保證飛機及駕駛人員安全，（六）起飛前先打電話通知北平，（七）機塲由聯合辦事處派員迎接，至隨行記者，葉氏允加考慮。五日下午五時再度通話時或可決定。又該團發言人曾資生鄭重聲稱：「中央社昨發靑島電訊所稱代表團代表吳裕後以私人關係與葉劍英通話各節，與事實不符，因該團從不以私人名義活動，且亦未由葉氏直接接聽電話」。</p>
<p>〔本報青島五日電〕京和平代表團名單，已於四日晚送平，代表團表示，該團名稱應爲「中國人民和平策進會中國各大學敎授國策研究會合組人民和平代表團」，名單如下：代表兼首席代表邱致中，代表兼秘書長吳裕後，代表兼發言人曾資生，代表鄧委雨·宋國樞·夏元芝·吳哲生，副秘書長苗迪青，秘書劉達逵·黃誥·任竹君，共十一人</p>
<h3>台幣匯率改卅五元</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北五日電〕台幣對金圓券匯率，七日改為金圓一圓兌台幣三十五元。</p>
<h3>上海代表團人選決定　任務爲和談敲門　北行期奉命展延一二日　黃紹竑黃旭初抵京謁李代總統商談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕政府和平代表立委黃紹竑，桂主席黃旭初，五日下午自漢乘機飛抵京。李代總統當晚邀宴兩氏及邵力子等，席間就和平問題交換意見·</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京五日電〕接近李代總統人士今夜稱：共方已給予李氏之和平提議以答復，此舉至少為展開正式談判之初步。共方答復詳情不得而知，但此間相信李氏終於設法與共方獲得直接接觸，而不必經由廣播電台公開交換意見。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京五日電〕李副總統左右，五日對和平前途公開表示樂觀，但其樂觀之原由則隱而不露。在表面上，李氏欲達成國共和平之任務，其跡象且較一星期前孫院長等在滬時為少，惟李氏之顧問則均表示信任，足見其至少希望能說勸共方開始和談。北平共軍歡迎上海和平代表說，殆為其樂觀原因之一。另一方面稱，共軍未能推進至長江北岸，已使李副總統一派自信其努力可以成功，共軍自長江附近撤退整編，顯係高級總部命令。共方若非有意和平，何必令軍隊停攻長江流域。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕顏惠慶等一行赴平與中共領袖晤談，轉達政府和平誠意事，政府現正就有關各項問題作妥愼硏討，為求其更完善周詳起見，原定六日自滬飛平之和平代表團一行，奉李代總統命，已決定延期一二再行啟程。邵力子原定六日飛滬與顏等同飛平，因代表團行期展緩，亦延期赴滬。又代表李代總統赴滬與顏惠慶等接洽促進和平之甘介侯，已定六日返京一行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海和平代表團人選昨已正式決定為顏惠慶，章士釗，江庸，凌憲揚，歐元懷，侯德榜等六人，除顏·章·江三氏早經決定外，其餘三氏乃甘介侯氏此次再度來滬接洽後，始獲同意。凌憲揚氏為滬江大學校長，歐元懷氏為大夏大學校長，侯德榜氏為永利公司總經理，分別代表敎育及實業兩界。代表團六人之外，邵力子甘介侯分別以私人資格參加，協助一切。張治中則因蘇聯政府對新疆·西伯利亞商約已有答覆，需返西北談判，未能同行。代表行期須俟今日甘介侯再度飛京請示後，始能決定，惟已確知為期甚近。北平方面經間，以供和平代表及其秘書使用，舉凡專機降落以及在平活動所需之交通工具，均己接洽妥當。代表團計劃留平一週，與中共各首領廣泛交換意見。以上各點，均由甘介儘於昨夜正式宣布。甘氏並表示：代表團之主要任務，在請中共迅速指定和談代表及進行和談之時間及地點，至於抵平後將晤見何人，待抵達後再說，原則上愈多愈好，暗示將先看葉劍英氏。並强調代表團將為未來之和談做「敲門工作，並非正式談和，更無談判局部和平之意，因今日「中央政府不能討論局部和平，而地方政府無權討論局部和平」也。甘氏附帶宣布：赴平之交通工具，本定使用追雲號專機，現則中央，中國兩航空公司自動表示願派機一架，送各代表赴平，將來究竟使用追雲機抑兩公司專機，尙待研究後再決定。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕監察院和平問題研究委員會劉平江，陶百川，倪弼等五人，於昨日下午二時聯袂往訪卽將飛平之顏惠慶，章士釗，江庸三氏於寓邸，表達監院同人對和平之期望，並就促進和平之具體辦法充份交換意見。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平五日電〕上海方面四日以無綫電話與北平區軍事管理委員會主席葉劍英接洽，葉氏已允招待上海和平代表團，惟規定三點：（一）談話須守秘密，非經許可，不得向報界發表。（二）不准新聞記者隨行。（三）以人民代表資格來平，不得代表政府。</p>
<p>甘介俟五日在滬招待中外記者談話情形（太報攝）</p>
<h3>陳誠昨午邀宴程思遠　提政軍改革意見　釋放張學良原則無問題</h3>
<p>〔本報台北五日電〕省主席陳誠五日午邀宴程思遠，由柳克述·賀衷寒·何聯奎等作陪，餐後兩氏作長談，程氏首將中央意志祥盡解釋，並徵詢對政治。經濟，軍事改革之意見。陳主席強調無論爲和爲戰，應以全國團結一致爲原則，並上尙須研究，當俟程氏返京後，另交主秘機關防部辦理。至於促翁文灝·孫連仲返京事，據程氏稱，翁近在台南，凖備以電話促駕，孫氏則將於日內往訪，渠留台期間不擬訪問張學良。</p>
<h3>中航失踪機一架　已載客飛抵延安　公司擬防止誤降辦法呈請施行</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島五日電〕據悉：此間有關方面業已接獲一特別電訊，中航公司失蹤機一架，載客十五人，已安抵延安。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北五日電〕中國航空公司總經理劉敬宜，日前自港抵台視察業務，五日飛返上海。據該公司負責人士稱：日前自滬飛靑中途降落濟南之第一三五號客機，根據該機起飛後，卽與地面斷絕聯絡一點判斷，由於「强迫降落」濟南之可能性甚大，該公司已致電北平方面，轉請濟南方面儘量給予乘客出境便利，倘飛機有損壞，亦盼協助修理，准許該機返航，惟迄今尙未獲得答復，該公司自該機誤降濟南後，現已擬定三項辦法，卽：（一）設法防止乘客進入駕駛員室。（二）請求政府准許駕駛員佩帶手槍自禦。（三）駕駛員必須連環具結。以上辦法一經核准，卽將施行。</p>
<h3>白吉爾旗艦下週來滬　駐華美海軍調整　美陸戰隊活動中心移滬</h3>
<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕美國西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾中將五日證實，渠將命令其旗艦「愛爾徒拉徒」號於下週中來滬，其統率之西太平洋艦隊之臨時總部同時前來。但白氏表明稱：此舉並非西太平洋艦隊總部將在上海成立之謂。白氏答覆是否將有更多美海軍陸戰隊來滬一問題稱：上海已有美海軍陸戰隊，假如需要更多，將派遣更多海軍陸戰隊來滬·白氏此項聲明乃代表在中國作例行視察旅行之美太平洋艦隊總司令海軍上將藍姆賽而發者。藍氏吿美新聞界稱：由於中國局勢之改變，兼加海軍預算减少，在中國及太平洋區內之美海軍，不得不予重行調整及調動。藍氏並强調白氏以前迭次之聲明稱：美對華政策乃在華府之國務院所決定者，海軍僅係實行其政策之機構而已。藍氏又稱：海軍經費之减少，不但影響海軍在華之地位，並且太平洋區中全部海軍設施亦受到影響。同時，發表任何關於因此事所受影響之詳情之文吿，則時間猶未成熟。重行估計局勢及自一個新基礎開始乃必要者，此一將面臨之問題，乃為一困難之問題。現在說出一新計劃似屬過早，此一政策之建議或實行，將以需要為轉移。</p>
<p>藍氏又稱：海軍經費已予核减，太平洋區各區之工作必須受有限制，中國適在此區域中。該區中各區之未來海軍設備之多寡，將由海軍因必須執行國務院命令事決定之，目前國務院對中國內戰有關之政策之主要部份之一，乃為保護美僑。白氏又重聲稱：美海軍政策乃為在任何地方有足够之美海軍陸戰隊足以應付局勢之需要。關於足够之問題由緊急需要決定。白氏指出，過去平津區為切需美海軍陸戰隊保護美僑之地方，大部份美僑現已撤離該區，今後上海當為與海軍陸戰隊職務有關之活動中心地。</p>

<h3>假如政府肯全面革新</h3>
<p>— 徐道鄰</p>
<p>關於行政上一個具體建議</p>
<p>前綫打敗仗，士兵成千成萬的傷亡，而高級將領的生活却愈為豪奢；老百姓家破人亡，流離失所，每天成百的餓死凍死，而豪門貪官的財富日益雄厚。這是今日的軍事和政治。</p>
<p>大街小巷，到處掛滿了衙門招牌，而社會上應管的事，却沒有一個人認眞去管。中央和地方，成千成萬的機關，天天在開會，天天在頒布法令，在制訂辦法，而實際上的國計民生，依然如舊，甚至每况愈下。幾十萬幾百萬的公務員，拿了穿不暖吃不飽的薪津，一早一晚，向公事房裏走進走出，祇是在一堆公文紙片裏面翻觔斗。這是今日的行政！</p>
<p>軍事戡亂時期，征兵征糧，當然是地方上第一要政。一縣之內，一切機關，一個月的開銷，抵不上一月副食馬乾的差額費，一整年的總預算，抵不上一次的壯丁安家費。政府向人民要求的，是征兵，征糧，攤派；而所給與他們的，是沿街乞食的難民，是生風惹事的流亡學生，是強買強賣的榮軍，是挨家擠進拍桌掉碗的軍屬。這是今日各地方的人民生活。</p>
<p>民生今日何以如此困難？是因為一年以來軍事的節節失利。軍事和政治何以如此腐敗？是因為當局者狹隘，虛偽，和自私的心理。行政何以如此低能？是因為現行的一切制度怯令人事之不合理。</p>
<p>在這樣環境之下，簽預的搞下去，當然祗有愈搞愈糟，愈搞愈苦，不論是戰是和，一切無從談起。我現在想討論的是：如果戰事會好轉，或者和談眞能得到一個停戰的結果，當局者在心理上能作一念的轉移，決定政策時眞能顧到廣大民衆的禍福，用人眞能根據他的才能抱負，功過是非，而不問他的派別系統，說話切切實實的說，作事切切實實的作，那麼在行政上，我們應當怎樣求改進？</p>
<p>我認為一個澈底和有效的行政改革Acministration日應當作到下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）裁併機構現在中央和地方的各種行政機構，須要加以改革的，約可分為三種：一種是名義上有正式職掌而實際上無權無能的經常機構（大半在中央），一種是實際上有權力而本身性質是重疊駢枝的臨時機構（大半在都市），一種是無所事事有名無實的一羣擺飾機構（大半在地方）。茲試為分析之如下：</p>
<p>經常機構（用方印的）之往往變為無權無能，是因為其主要業務，為的是應付人事，往往被剔出來而另成機構（地政衛生警察之脫離內政部是也），或索性另成臨時機構（社會部之外有行總，省府之外有司令兼行政長官，財政部之外有物資局是也）。而這些臨時機構（用長印的），因為其首長多是當朝紅人，所管的事又是一時爭務，對其主管機關，當然不在眼內，所以重疊之外，因而遲滯，駢枝之餘，又加麻木。而其本身組織，因為是天之　子，當然是廣優人員，寬列經費，在政府機關裏形成一稱龐大而空虛闊綽而浪費的特殊階級！至於一些有名無實的　飾機構，多半是因為黨國要人，為黨派分贓，安排人事而成立的許多中央機關，為安置他們系統下的嘍囑，就一條鞭地在地方各層普遍設置子孫飯碗（處·局·所·科），然而事實上旣籌不到舉辦業務的經費，又找不到對這些業務有訓練有志趣的人員，而環境上更根本沒有辦理這些業熒務的迫切需要。自然這些機構，祇得無所事，不生不死，黯淡而無聊的度他們的冷靜生活。</p>
<p>因為連年增加出無數的駢枝機構，和那許許多多有名無實的擺飾機構之無怯充實，遂使主管官廳無法迅速和有效的解決問題，公文來往旅行程期又日見延畏而無法减短，公務員的數目日見龐大而待遇益難改善，於是一般行政機關普遍地變成無能和浪費！</p>
<p>我們要裁併機構，關於上述的重疊駢枝的機構，應當聘請若干學理通達而曉暢政務的公正人士，組織一個委員會，——要特別注重其中立和客觀的立塲，——把這些機構本身的工作情形（業務·經費·組織·目的·效率）作一個澈底的調查。再根據所得的資料，和它們有關之經常機關的關係，作詳密之研究，而決定其組織上之調整。我相信經過這種整理工作之後，現在所有的重疊駢枝機構，一大半可以裁撤或編併，而大多數的經常機構也將變為有力和有能。</p>
<p>關於地方上一切不具成效，形同虛設的擺飾機構之裁併，我們應當責成地方高級機關，指定公正幹練的幹部，切實調查其工作情形，詳細研究其調整辦怯，凡是無充分推行業務之經費，或者無得力推行業務之人員，或者無適當推行業務之環境者，一律予以裁撤，千萬不可憧憬於其招牌上之美名而有所顧忌或憐惜。如果白養活一羣無所事事的人員，而強迫其變成廢物，對其他人員旣有欠公平，對他們自己也太不人道。</p>
<p>（二）緊縮人員現在全國的行政機關，把幾個的人員太少而根本無怯作事的機關除外，可以說無一處不是人浮於事，喫茶吸烟，看報，談笑話，打磕冲。然而此猶其害之不者，勞逸不均而引起同事間之不和協，每人要設法在公事上蓋一顆岡章而使文書格外遲綏，工作太關而造成一般空氣之鬆懈，人心之不振作，此其害之大者。</p>
<p>緊縮人員的辦法，應採取下列步驟：（一）把一個機關裏一個星期內的收文發文全部集中起來，施行一次納檢查。（二）根據收發公文的件數性質，計算這個機關必須要的人數。—我的標準：作料員的，每日至少應分配普通公事三件至五件，作書記錄事的，每日至少應抄寫兩千五百至三千字—計算時依公文件數分配科員辦事負，依　寫字數分配書記錄事，依科員書記的人數分配事務員。（三）最後再依據這些一必須的辦公人員的數目，調整組織。—我的標準：五個至十個科員成一股，三股至五股成一科，五科至七科成一個廳處局。而在現有人員中，何人應留，何人應去，一律用考試，考續，測騐等公開和公平的方法。每個機構，經過這樣的調整，—依業務定員額，依員額定組織，—可以裁减下來的人員，我相信至少有三分之二，多的我相信可以到五分之四。</p>
<p>這樣裁减下來的人員，我們應當讓他一律仍支原來的待遇，（失業的公務員太多，將造成嚴重社會問題），但為他們謀適當的出路，應當配合目前各地方鄉村上的需要，舉辦各種訓練班講習會，（須要鄭重其事的找第一流人才來主持）。然後分配他們一種新的積極的工作。我的估計，這些被淘汰的公務員最好的出路，是成年文盲補習教育，鄉村教育，農村副業指導，農村合作推廣，保幹事等等。以中國廣大的農村社會，容。納這些人，是不成問題的。而祗要我們作到能使這些都市人回鄉下去生活，我保證全國政治經濟必有起色。</p>
<p>（三）提高待遇裁併了機構和减縮了人員之後，我們才可以談提高待遇，也可以說後一者是前兩者的目的。不把公務員待遇提高到勉強維持生活的標準，而想遏止貪污，提高效能，如同用了一羣貪污無能的公務員，而希望政治淸明人民康樂一樣，猶緣木而求魚也。如果一個機關，經過裁併緊縮，原有人員祗賸到三分或五分之一以後，我主張這一羣精銳幹部，在經濟紛亂之中，一律改用硬幣發薪（比方由十塊到二百塊）。由地方籌待遇的，可比照用祿米制（比方由一石至二十石）。如果把人民現在對軍事上的一切負担——壯丁費，差額費，各種臨時攤派——轉用於這筆改良待遇上面，是絕對綽有餘裕的。那時我們對這一批拿改良待遇的公務員，就可以拿絕對不客氣的態度和心理，要求他們不得貪污，不許低能；低能的我們可以隨時更動而不愁應者無人，貪污的我們可以嚴厲的懲辦而受之者也死而無怨了。</p>
<p>（四）革新幾個制度在許許多多新，不能達到原來的好目的，而反發生了很多相反的壤作用。我們現在必須認淸事實，鼓起勇氣，大刀闊斧的來從事革新。</p>
<p>（一）行政三聯制現在全國機關，無不在執行三聯制，而究其實際情形，物力方面消耗的，是編製印刷各種計劃和報告的紙量，印刷及郵資，人力方面消耗的，是各機關指定專門應付所謂設計考核的人員，而成效方面呢，是百分之百的一套官樣入股！（今年審查去年的工作計劃，也算設計；小官到大衙門一住，部長請幾頓飯吃，送一點禮物，回去寫一篇不痛不　的報告，謂之考核。）我主張把這個制度，痛快地取銷，以節省許多人力物力，矯正高調虛偽的風氣。</p>
<p>（二）鍂叙制度　我們十餘年來的人事制度，在考選方面，尙算比較略有成就。經過高普考的人，多少具有相當水準。銓叙方面，可說是完全失敗。因為這個制度，絲毫未能產生一些選拔劃　的功效，而却強迫出來多少假著作，假文憑，假證件，而全國內外大小各機關，白養活成千成萬專們去應付這些假文憑假證件的人事人員。相反的，有本領有氣節的人，因為不肯假冒欺騙，反趕不上冒牌頂替者之級高俸優，甚或以其資格不合而強其去職，則其為害更大了。本來，以中國教育之不發達，考試之不普遍，而硬要抬高公務員的任用資格，以亂世應當集中權責於各級主官的時候，而硬要限制其用人權，十年來外患內憂，兵荒馬亂，流離播遷，而硬是死綁綁的要這樣那機證明文件，這種制度，如何能行得通？我認為現在的銓叙制度，應當毅然停止，各機關用人，要有員額等級的限制，不要有資格的限制，用人之權，屬之主官，待遇厚薄，全憑能力。</p>
<p>（三）計政制度在理論上似乎建立在三個前提之上：（一）一個機關的政務業務事務，可以全部信任主官，惟對於用錢則絕對不能信任。（二）主官之操守必不可信，而會計人員之操守必可信。（三）一般人負有被主官指使操縱之處，而會計人員為「超然」的，可以不受任何影響。這三個前提是否準確，凡稍涉政塲的，當可解答。而在經濟混亂，物價不安，幣值貶跌的今日，這計政制度正因為是報銷的必須手續，造成為貪污舞弊的最好保障。現在的計政制度，不能為國家人民省錢是小事，使眞正想作事的人束縛牽製，不能發揮能力是大事。白養活成千成萬的會計人員是小事，使貪污舞弊之流，單據齊全，手續完備，可以避免法律的制裁，社會的指摘是大事。我主張廢除一切計政制度，裁撤一切固定的會計審計人員，（幾個用綫特別多的機關，當然須另想辦法），而另外在中央和地方特設幾個專門審計機構，——必須妙選幾個剛正不阿之士，——隨時不斷的作突擊式的抽查，切切實實的查，嚴嚴狠狠的辦，使作事的可以放開手，作弊的不能不有戒心。我想或者比較是辦怯（反正不至於比現在的事情形更壞）。</p>
<p>（四）民意機構依現在的國情講，想行政機關健全固難，想民意機關健全也不容易。而依現在行政機關的情形講，有民意機關存在，究竟比沒有民意機構要好些。不過行政機關設施，過分受民意機關的牽制，在目前實非善策。我主張多給予行政機關設施的自由，而使民意機關多發揮其監督和彈劾的作用。（下接第四版）</p>

<h3>大西洋公約草案大體完成　下星期內即可公布　規定簽約國如遭侵略一致採制裁行動　挪外長啓程赴美參加討論</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕據外交界消息：美國與談判北大西洋公約之六個國家，計劃於下週公布該公約秘密條文之綱要。彼等透露各項要點已達成協議，將透露之詳細條文正在由美·加·英·法·荷·比·盧七國商討中。據可靠消息稱，該公約將認為對任何一會員國之攻擊，乃為對全體之攻擊，而對侵略國立卽採取行動。此項行動並不一定是武力千涉，可能對侵略國或軍隊採取外交與經濟上制裁之形式。以前規定如會員國以軍事行動幫助友國之議已經放棄，因遭受各參與國家之一致強烈反對。例如美國參戰必須獲取國會特別怯案之通過。按照新公約，各會員國之議會可自行決擇參戰與否。此一條約之有效期間為十六年，期滿續訂。在條約規定下，將成立一北大西洋安全理事會，但無命令各會員國參戰之權力。去年六月美國卽開始考慮此一公約。正式條文可望於本月杪或下月初為此七草約國之外畏及任何決意參加國家之外長簽署。此間官負構，在條約明文公佈前，如挪威·丹麥·冰島·葡萄牙與義大利有意參加此條約，仍有機會。又稱，愛爾蘭於此時並無參加之希望。此條約為美國與西歐國家問之第一次承平時期之聯盟。</p>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖四日電〕前葛羅米柯亞聯合國之同僚期待此靑年外次將於蘇聯外交部任更大工作。自葛氏去夏自成功湖息影返莫斯科另任新職後，其活動對多數外交家已成為神秘。此間極少人相信此卅九歲之莫斯科高級外交家將長此漠然無聞。此間猜想葛羅米柯將繼維辛斯基之職，而為最有聲勢的一號外交次長。聯合國人士認為外長莫洛托夫將在蘇聯政府任更大工作、</p>
<p>莫洛托夫如非史達林元帥下之第一紅人，乃史達林右手少數人中之一，蓋莫洛托夫曾被提名為史達林繼承人之一。莫洛托夫職務之更換，將使維辛斯基昇為外長，如其健康允許。在最近巴黎聯大會議時曾看到維辛斯基之動作與辯才之聯合國代表，認為維辛斯基實為最優秀之人選。新自莫斯科歸來之美出版家最近訪問聯合國時稱，渠確信維辛斯基將任外長職，但聯合國副秘書畏蘇代表沙白賴夫對此甚少支持。聯合國觀察家認為美駐蘇大使史密斯離職時，曾訪葛羅米柯長談，頗值重視，此蓋表示前聯合國代表葛氏現正於莫斯科外交部負責美蘇關係事宜。</p>

部份學校至今尙無教授會之組織，故現稱國立大專院校教授聯誼會。哈佛滬同學會　定期舉行年宴　　本市哈佛同學近改選一九四九年度職員，當選者有會長卡勃特，副會長徐維明，書記鮑德明，會計錢乃信。該會訂於十二日午後六時起，假中國銀行大禮堂舉行年宴，除新舊職員交替儀式外，經合中國分署署長賴樸翰為哈佛大學現任校董之一，將出席致辭。該會會員可與中信局產險處聶光坻接治定座。假如政府肯全面革新　上接　二版　　（五）司怯制度　抗戰以來，最使人痛心者，莫過於司怯界聲譽之跌落。此乃國家前途之最大隱憂，可惜尙不被人重視。司法之受人指摘，不外兩端，案件積壓，往往經年不決，使人不敢問津，一也。任情裁判，不負責任，反正每案必經上訴，使人信仰盡失，二也。挽救之法予意由各地方籌款，合成硬幣或米榖，成一司法基金，責成各級怯院院長，廣羅推事，或額外聘致資深律師，組織一臨時委員會，負責淸理積案，同時規定推事接辦新案，於某一期限辦結者，應得若千獎金。以上兩種開支，皆由此司法基金支付。再則司法制度，應規定推事問案，應對裁判負責。凡推事判案有若干件以上經上訴撇銷者，應罷免其職務，並同時取銷其怯官及律師資格。一方面提高上訴費用，以免一般人利用之以拖延時間。而陪審制之引用，更值得我們的研究和促進。　　（五）停頒法規，運用命令　我認為政府有心革新，應當決定於一年之內再不頒佈任何法規。過去二十年中，平常時期一半，戰事時期一半，所有已經頒佈的法規，可稱包羅萬象，應有盡有。然而事實上發生的效果在那裏？如果法令條條有效，拿一部內政法規來看，中國應該是怎麼樣的一個法治國家？我們現在不是缺乏法規，而是法規太多；不是我們的法親不好，而是我們的法規不生效。不生效的原因，是因為閉戶造車，不切實際；是因為各級上層機關，一方面太注意控制，處處要以法規束縛下層，一方面又怕負責任，處處想利用法規以代替命令，就是願意承認所制訂的某一種法規之不善，而不願意承認所處理的某一件事的不當。所以我主張以後一切機關，再不得頒佈任何一般通行的怯規，而要把過去的一切怯規全部保留，供施政時的參攷。同時處處責成有責有權的機關，遇事全權處理，非至絕對無法決定時，不許向上級機關請示；而上級機關祗許因時因事因理，用命令指示，不得藉口法規成例，作其准駁之依據。（至少我們應當給予各行政機關，對現有法規，具有正當理由時，可以酌意變通之權。）如此，則凡有事悄，不致無人處理，而處理之好壤，主管者不能卸責，而任何事情，處理機關，上級機關，都可以和都必須因時制宜，適當處理，而不致也不敢以「事關通案」四字來擋塞應付一切了。　　（六）改革的步驟　談到行政的改革，我們要深切明瞭，一切要緊關鍵，全在實際執行的人，就是說，一切在各地的行政負負人，我不但主張各省應當有各省的改革方法，各縣應當有各縣的改革方法，並且主張每個人不妨有每個人的改革方法。以後中國的整個命運如何，全要看各省的情形如何，而各省的情形如何，又全要看各縣的情形如何，而縣政如何又一切全看縣長　　我們想把縣政弄好，必須辦到能拿分量重的人物去作縣長。我相信要能多有幾個有優良成績的作過部次長的人去幹縣長，對國家的裨益是不可限量的。我們要他們去，不是要他們為縣長而作縣長，我們是要他們能多帶幾個重要幹部去研究和試騐，改良，和創造。我相信一個部長階級的縣長，帶着四五個司畏階級的，七八個科長階級的幹部，到一個重要的縣份，作上半年八個月，一定可以把這一縣的一切庶政—戶政，警政，財政，糧政—整頓的像個樣十，把一切制度—組織，人事，經費—安排到行得通的規模。此時，再把這裏得力的幹部—原有的舊幹部，加上吸收訓練出來的新幹部，—分散到鄰近幾個縣份，根據已得到的經騐，運用已成的熟手，推行有效的方法。這樣由小而大，由近而遠的逐漸推廣，我相信一個省份，不須三年，必可小成。再拿此省的幹部，推行鄰省，五年之問，全國皆將改觀。到了那時，高高在上的中央，雖欲不治，不可得也。　　以上所談，祗限於一般行政上的改革。至於軍事經濟兩方面許許多多的問題，留待比我更有研究的去討論，茲不妄說。昨晚籃球聯賽　華聯苦戰獲勝　二分擊敗麥令　結果六十一比五十九分　　〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽昨晚精彩戰，華聯二分勝麥令斯，六十一比五十九，上半時三十三比三十二，華聯亦經過一番苦戰，才追出麥令，可謂勝險極險極。華聯表演减色，或係天寒所致，麥令人高，華聯用低傳，亦未見收獲良好結果。大李未登塲，吳成章傷足，俱影響實力。上半時麥令曾以十比五，十五比五佔先，華聯落後十分之多，苦苦作戰，上半時才追出一分，三十三比三十二。下半時阿弟負傷登塲樂嘉洲述中帶罰，造成四十八平手，又成各五十，五十七，難解難分之局，良雄連下二關，華聯終以六十一比五十九勝一球。體育館觀衆二千餘人，表示滿意。　　華聯　犯　分　麥令斯　犯　分　　傳金聲　五　六　歐恩益　〇　八　　吳成間　一　三　哥芬斯　一　十三　　樂嘉洲　三　十四　葉姆山　三　八　　劉福善　三　十三　利斯　四　十四　　包松圓　四　十五　古　地　〇　四　　張良雄　四　十　喬克遜　四　八　　共計　二〇　六一　茀勞特　一　四　　共計　十三　三九　　　賽前兩塲：（一）甲一組，仁餘勝初次出馬之美軍培斐爾，三十六比三十二，上半時仁餘二十六比十五居先。（二）女子組星華勝力隊，四十二比十七，前半十三比八　　今晚秩序　　綠隊對約翰（女子組）五時卅分　　郵電對警機（甲二B）六時一刻　　培斐爾對海靑（甲一組）七時一刻　　（綠隊）黃明媛，王維珍，朱錦芸，石宗蘭，吳愛蓮，伍美英，曹受麗，曹曼珠，陸惠君。　　（約翰）林靜怡，李淼，周志芬，姚惠娟，吳漢運，鄭靜淵，張羅羅，李家福，荘雅先，魏美瑾，朱敏，孫蕙芳。某太太熱心助學　慨捐金飾三兩餘　　本報主辦「讀者助學金」，自前日「無名氏」慨捐十萬元後，昨日復有一女讀者親自來館，以「某太太」名義，慨捐金飾三件，計重三兩零二分，再創捐款新紀錄。據稱：「對於淸寒學生，素表同情，申報歷年倡導助學運動，救濟淸寒失學，極為欽佩。爰將所藏金飾三件，捐充助學金，以冀對莘莘學子，略盡心意。並盼各婦女界同志，紛起響應。」臨去並再三囑託為善不求虛名，請弗將眞姓名發表云云。本報於受領之餘，殊深感謝，甚盼各界熱心士女，再接再厲，踴躍捐輸，助學前途，實深利賴。又本報讀者施文潮次女于歸，將賀儀五千九百元移充助學，併此誌謝。開槍追捕逃兵　流彈死傷兩人　　〔本報訊〕昨晨九時許，南市中華路有一逃兵由西朝東飛奔，後面隨有四軍人，緊追不捨。當折入應公祠路口時，追隨之四軍人卽拔槍開放十餘響，結果將該逃兵命中胸膊一彈，應聲倒地就擒。同時子彈橫飛時，流彈死傷男女各一。事後查悉死者為一老嫗王房氏（七十二歲，甬籍，住中華路九八五號）。傷者名李嘉與，十八歲，山東人。後經人車送仁濟醫院求治。死屍一具嗣用屍車載入同仁輔元堂候騐。該逃兵究屬何處部隊，警局正飭警偵查中云。國際報話費　調整折合率　　交通部國際電台及上海電信局奉令自二月六日起，將用以計算國際電信資費之美金及金怯郎折合金圓券率分別調整為：每一美金折合金圓券七百圓，每一金法卽折合金圓券二百三十圓。破獲金鈔套滙三機構　經理職員等三人被捕　　〔本報訊〕本市金融管局昨會同警局經警組搜查黑市金鈔及套匯機構，共計九處，有三家證據屬實，故各號負責人均當塲被捕帶局扣押偵訊。些二家為（一）北京路五九六弄三十九號公和藥材行，計抄獲匯票十七紙，信三封，負責人溫卓餘未在，當將該行職員余蘭芳帶局。（三）河南中路如意里廿號福義祥申莊，職員張文彬被捕。（三）金陵東路維祥里一號邱發利行，計抄獲套匯電碼六本，密碼紙一張，經理邱映三帶局。兩輪日內駛華北　載去麵粉兩萬噸　　航業界對華北航綫，刻正積極籌備恢復中，現已決定派由「唐山」號及「大上海」號二巨輪，載運首批麵粉二萬噸左右駛華北，並已獲得軍事有關當局之同意，日內卽可開航云。寄貨不交還　被訴侵占罪　　川沙人趙元生，向與同鄉唐季元合夥開設三泰醫園，去年底，店有友人壟漢臣，向趙購得超油一担，特油一祖，甲油二祖，乙汕二担，並板醬五十斤，甜麵醬二十斤，惟當時因冀無處存放，乃寄存於三泰醫園，約一月後壟卽前往取貨，詎趙元生竟佔為已有，不肯交貨，壟乃迫不得已，向地檢處提出控告，該案業經檢察官偵審終結，卽於昨日正式對趙依侵占罪提起公訴云。中華烟草公司　解僱風潮解決　　中華烟草公司，近為改進業務，三千職工中調職者三人，改聘者六人，解僱十五人中一小部份被調人員，前曾醞釀事端，純係要求解倔費而起，昨經社會局調解，風潮已告圓滿解決。敵產清理處結束　處長吳則中辭職　　全國各區敵偽產業淸理處，為加速結束淸理處業務起見，將各區淸理機構業務及結束事宜，改由行政院敵偽產業處理委員會辦理，總處處長兼蘇浙皖區敵偽產業淸理處處長吳則中氏，已於前日提出辭呈。前駐日代表團代表　林士模定八日演講　　前中國駐日代表團代表林士模博士應聯青社之邀，定於八日中午十二時半，假八秈橘青年會九機四十六室，演講「在麥師統治下之日本近狀」對於賠款及歸還物資曁商務貿易等，將有詳盡之報告與意見，凡該社社員，均可參加聽講。共舞臺前慘劇　軍人看戲肇事　擲彈死傷五人　　〔本報訊〕中正中路共舞台，於昨晚六時二十分許夜戲將開塲時，有軍人二三十名意圖無票入塲觀劇，遭駐塲憲兵勸阻，悻悻而去。未幾復有軍人百餘　擁到來，由一大隊長龍汝順率領士兵徐金水，劉玉漢，史耀堂，吳順富，徐克興等五人登樓入賬房間交涉無票觀劇。不料門前大批士兵不耐久候，欲衝入塲內，憲兵睹狀恐肇巨禍，卽將鐵門拉閉，擊槍喝止。門外軍人則高聲叫罵。正在僵持中，忽有一軍人將手溜彈一枚向內投擲，適擊中鐵門撞回，致下落行人道上，轟然一響，頓時爆炸，鐵片四飛，當塲死傷五人，均為靑年，計死者學生齊　華，十七歲，鎭江人，家住新永安街龍安里五號，腦壳迸裂，厥狀殊慘。其弟齊耀林，十三歲，彈片入背。周如森，揚州人，竹器業，厲城內福佑路三六二號，兩腿炸傷。劉阿松，南京人，十四歲，報販，住復興中路一〇六弄四十四號，傷手臂。郝雲海，六合人，十五歲，與周如森同住，遭彈片射傷頭部。後經警將傷者分送仁濟，南洋等醫院療治。屍體載送同仁轉元堂候驗。據悉，該批軍人肇禍後，卽四散而逸，尙有樓上交涉之長官及士兵六名，嗣經海陸空憲兵稽查隊帶去偵訊後，申解警備部核辦。鐵路再勝志超　精武今逢中航　　甲組足球聯賽，昨日鐵路對志超，結果一比零鐵路再勝，上半時無紀錄，下半時張傑射中一球。今日下午甲組賽，精武對中航，上午有丙組總決初賽兩塲，秩序如下：　　精武對中航（甲組〕下午三時逸園　　公交對永安（丙決）上午九時逸園　　技置對螢光（丙決）十時卅分逸園氣象預測　　華中：睛，冷，中度北風，晨輕霧。　　五日溫度：最低攝氏一度三（華氏卅四度三），最高攝氏四度六（華氏四十度二）。　　上海：雲轉晴，冷，中度北風至東北風，晨輕霧。</p>

<h3>Government Begins Working in Guangzhou, Executive Yuan Council Meeting Held Tomorrow Afternoon, Presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans to Inspect Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 5th] The Executive Yuan officially began working in Guangzhou on the 5th. In the morning, Premier Sun and Vice Premier Wu invited Legislative Yuan Vice President Liu Jianqun, members of the Legislative Yuan in Guangzhou, and the speakers of the provincial and municipal councils to inquire about the security and economic situation in Guangdong Province, and to consult on opinions regarding the current situation. In the afternoon, they invited heads of various ministries and commissions from the south to discuss matters and give instructions. Premier Sun also scheduled a reception for reporters on the 6th. According to sources, after arriving here yesterday, Premier Sun immediately convened a meeting with military and political leaders, including Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, Zhang Fakui, and Liu Jiwen. The content was not disclosed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th] The Executive Yuan is scheduled to attend the expanded memorial week assembly held at the Memorial Hall on the 7th, then visit the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs at Huanghuagang, and hold an Executive Yuan Council meeting at 4:00 PM. Premier Sun and Vice Premier Wu are also scheduled to invite members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans staying in Guangzhou, as well as members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Kuomintang, to a symposium at the Municipal Government Guest House at 10:00 AM on the 6th. Furthermore, the Central Standing Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting in Guangzhou on the morning of the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the political rumors sparked by Premier Sun's trip to Guangzhou, according to Gan Jiehou, he was ordered to meet with Premier Sun on the 3rd of this month. Premier Sun said at the time, "I must go to Guangzhou once, firstly because I have already notified the diplomatic corps to move to Guangzhou. Several countries' embassies have moved south, and some ambassadors or ministers have already arrived in Guangzhou. It is polite to make a trip to Guangzhou. At the same time, there are several things in Guangzhou that must be handled in person. However, I will return to Nanjing within days." In fact, the Legislative Yuan has decided to hold a meeting in Nanjing. The Executive Yuan is constitutionally responsible to the Legislative Yuan, and the heads of ministries and commissions must submit policy reports and answer inquiries. It is impossible to establish two separate locations. In spirit, it is necessary to be in the same location to be responsible. Therefore, the Executive Yuan will definitely move back to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian and Supervisory Yuan President Yu Youren are scheduled to fly to Guangzhou from Nanjing by special plane at 10:00 AM on the 6th. The purpose of their trip is to understand the situation in Guangzhou after the Executive Yuan moved south and to urge Premier Sun to return to Nanjing. It is said that the two will also return to Nanjing within three to five days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 5th] According to Legislative Yuan Vice President Liu Jianqun, it is not yet known when President Tong will come to Guangzhou. The third session of the Legislative Yuan will be held in mid-February in accordance with the constitution. If the government moves south, the meeting place will be in Guangzhou. Liu ended with an optimistic tone, saying, "China always has a way."</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Prepares to Reconvene in Guangzhou, Supervisory Committee Members Remaining in Shanghai Dissatisfied with Executive Yuan's Move South</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Chen Kewen returned to Nanjing from Shanghai by train on the morning of the 5th. According to his interview with reporters, the date and location of the Legislative Yuan meeting are difficult to determine at present. However, most of the Legislative Yuan staff have left Nanjing, so it is unlikely that it will be convened in Nanjing. According to his statistics, the largest number of Legislative Committee members are in Shanghai, reaching over a hundred, followed by Guangzhou. There are also many in Guangxi, Taiwan, and Nanjing. When and where the meeting will be held in the future will depend on seeking the opinions of the majority of Legislative Committee members and the development of the situation. Chen recently went to Shanghai to distribute public funds to Legislative Committee members in Shanghai. He will go to Guangzhou and Guangxi within days, but the date is undecided.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th] After Legislative Yuan Vice President Liu Jianqun and Deputy Secretary-General Yan Guofu led staff to Guangzhou at the end of last month to prepare for the Legislative Yuan to convene in Guangzhou, they actively made preparations. After consultation, it was decided that the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall would be the meeting place, and the Wende Road Sun Yat-sen Library and the Guanyinshan Zhongyuangang Library would be the offices. Hotels were booked for the committee members' accommodation, and each committee member could be assigned a room. All resumption affairs are ready, and more than forty Legislative Committee members from various places have already reported for duty, and the rest are coming to Guangzhou one after another. According to the Deputy Secretary-General, the resumption will be held as soon as the Legislative Committee members meet the legal quorum.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Supervisory Committee members remaining in Shanghai held a symposium at the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Committee office at 9:00 AM on the 5th. Over fifty people attended, including Vice President Liu Zhe, and Supervisory Committee members Ju Zheng, Yang Hu, Liu Pingjiang, and Ni Bi. Wang Xiangchen was elected as the chairman. The theme of the discussion focused on promoting peace and the government's relocation. The majority of the Supervisory Committee members expressed dissatisfaction with the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou, and they all believed that the Supervisory Yuan should not move with the government in order to facilitate the early realization of peace. The Yuan meeting in February is still scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 15th. The symposium decided to establish a Peace Issues Research Committee, and Liu Pingjiang, Tao Baichuan, Ni Bi, and others were appointed to preside over the discussion of concrete steps to promote peace. The meeting adjourned at noon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Over forty Supervisory Committee members remaining in Shanghai held a discussion yesterday and decided to formally impeach Premier Sun for ordering the heads of various ministries to move south, disrupting government affairs and unsettling people's minds.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou to Become an Economic Center, Deputy Finance Minister Yang Daoyue and Others Arrive One After Another, Advance Personnel of Various Embassies Arrive in Guangzhou One After Another</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 5th] Current signs indicate that Fuzhou will become an economic center. Deputy Finance Minister Yang Daoyue, Director of the National Treasury Wang Fuzhou, and Director of the Salt Administration Li Tang have all arrived in Fuzhou by plane one after another. The head office of the Farmers Bank of China has found a location on Shangteng Road in the city to build a new office. In addition, a large number of public and private banks plan to move to Fujian. There are widespread rumors among the people that the Ministry of Finance will move to Southern Fujian for office work.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 5th] Recently, many people have been evacuating from the capital to Guangdong and Guangxi, and the traffic on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has exceeded its saturation point. Currently, the highways that can be accessed are one from the Hangzhou-Huizhou Road to Tunxi, passing through Jingdezhen to enter Jiangxi. The security on this line is poor. The other is from Chun'an via Jiangshan and Shangrao to Nanchang. Over a hundred military vehicles pass through this road every day. From Nanchang to Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, the roads are clear.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th] Recently, embassies of various countries in Nanjing have been sending advance personnel to Guangzhou to find office locations. It has been found that those who have arrived here include U.S. Minister Clark; Counselor of the British Embassy, ​​Goldher; Counselor of the French Embassy, ​​Lohai; First Secretary of the Australian Embassy, ​​Li Guijiang; Counselor of the Italian Embassy, ​​Jibi Ge; Counselor of the Dutch Embassy, ​​Wei Maoxiang; First Secretary of the Indian Embassy, ​​Li Nan; Business Counselor of the Czech Embassy, ​​Shang Ni; Second Secretary of the Burmese Embassy, ​​Wu Bi; and Soviet Ambassador Rosen and his entourage. Before finding suitable embassy locations, most embassies are temporarily staying at the Aiqun Hotel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has specially appointed Wang Jingxian, a protocol officer, to be responsible for reception.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th, United Press] The State Department announced today that thirteen members of the U.S. Embassy in China have moved from Nanjing to Guangzhou with the National Government. Ambassador Stuart and 39 members of his staff, along with six members of their families, remain in Nanjing. The personnel moving to Guangzhou are led by Minister Clark.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 5th] Key figures who have moved south are busy looking for houses. The provincial and municipal governments are doing their best to fulfill their landlord duties. The government that moved south does not show any signs of activity. Today, personnel from the embassies of nine more countries arrived here from Nanjing. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Guangzhou formally entertained foreign guests for the first time last night. The U.S. Embassy office is located in a new house in Shamian, which is still being renovated, but U.S. Minister Clark and embassy staff have already started working today.</p>
<h3>Presidential Seal Still in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Foreign news reported that the presidential seal has been transported to Guangzhou. Huang Xuecun, Director of the Second Bureau of the Presidential Palace, formally denied it on the 5th. According to Huang, the presidential seal is still in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>President Chiang Visits Yuwang Temple</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Ningbo, 5th] President Chiang returned to Xikou after retiring, and more than ten days have passed in the blink of an eye. He enjoys visiting scenic spots in Xikou and has also visited places such as Xiaowang Temple in Fengcheng, enjoying his leisure time. At around 9:00 AM this morning, he and Chiang Ching-kuo, Yu Jishi, and others took two small cars from Xikou directly to Ningbo and then to Yuwang Temple in Eastern Yin for sightseeing. Upon hearing of the President's arrival, the abbot immediately led all the monks to greet him in front of the temple. The President and his party rested briefly in the abbot's room and then toured the entire temple, looking very happy. At noon, they were treated to a vegetarian feast by the abbot. Chen Youhua, the Magistrate of Yin County, heard the news and took a car to Yuwang Temple to greet him at 2:00 PM. The police patrol team also rushed to patrol and guard the highway area. The President returned to Xikou by the original car at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Ding Zhipan Discusses Peace Movement</h3>
<p>Partial Peace Is No Different from Surrender</p>
<p>Beijing and Shanghai Cannot Be the Second Beiping</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 5th] Chairman Ding Zhipan expounded his views on peace at a press conference today. He first said with a smile, "Because I am a soldier, I naturally hope to fight on." However, this statement was immediately interpreted as a "joke." He believes that because the Communist Party's attitude is strong, the prospects for peace talks are not optimistic. After the meeting, Ding also frequently spoke to our newspaper reporters about the current situation, which is actually more difficult to achieve peace than to fight. He also said that he is prepared to have the belief of Zheng Chenggong and Shi Kefa. When the reporter inquired about the local peace movement in Beijing and Shanghai that is currently being brewing, Ding replied that local peace is no different from surrender, and Beiping can be taken as a lesson. Ding's view on local peace in Beijing and Shanghai is that because the people's hope for peace is more urgent, and local peace conforms to the Communist Party's conspiracy to divide the government's power, this statement is very likely to be accepted by the Communist Party. However, this is only limited to the Communist Party, with the people as the object of negotiation. From the military's standpoint, under the major premise of the government's sovereignty and national interests, it is impossible to sit idly by and watch Beijing and Shanghai become the second Beiping. Regarding the issue of river defense, Ding said that there are nearly a hundred warships constantly patrolling the river below Nanjing, and the garrison troops on the Nanjing-Shanghai line have more than ten armies, so there is no problem with river defense. However, this does not mean that the Communist army can never cross the river. Small units of less than a thousand people can "sneak across" at any time, so he has recently been actively carrying out mass organization and training work in the Jiangnan area, targeting this point.</p>
<h3>Nanjing People's Peace Delegation Flew to Beiping from Qingdao Today, List of 11 Members Announced</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 5th] The Beijing People's Peace Delegation spoke with the Beiping Joint Office on the morning of the 5th, and Zhou Beifeng relayed to Mr. Ye Jianying that there were slight revisions to the matters notified yesterday: (1) Take off for Beiping at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th; (2) Land at Xiyuan Airport; (3) Bring enough fuel for the return trip; (4) Only open radio communications when flying over Beiping; (5) Absolutely guarantee the safety of the aircraft and crew; (6) Call Beiping before taking off; (7) The Joint Office will send personnel to greet them at the airport. As for the accompanying reporters, Mr. Ye agreed to consider it. A decision may be made when they speak again at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. In addition, Zeng Zisheng, the spokesperson for the delegation, solemnly stated: "The Qingdao telegram issued by the Central News Agency yesterday, which claimed that Wu Yuhou, a representative of the delegation, spoke with Ye Jianying through personal relations, is not in accordance with the facts, because the delegation never engages in activities in a personal capacity, and Mr. Ye did not directly answer the phone."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 5th] The list of the Beijing Peace Delegation was sent to Beiping on the evening of the 4th. The delegation stated that the name of the delegation should be "People's Peace Delegation Jointly Organized by the China People's Peace Promotion Association and the China National University Professors National Policy Research Association." The list is as follows: Representative and Chief Representative Qiu Zhizhong, Representative and Secretary-General Wu Yuhou, Representative and Spokesperson Zeng Zisheng, Representatives Deng Weiyu, Song Guoshu, Xia Yuanzhi, Wu Zhesheng, Deputy Secretary-General Miao Diqing, Secretaries Liu Da Kui, Huang Gao, and Ren Zhujun, a total of eleven people.</p>

<h3>Candidates for Shanghai Delegation Determined, Mission is to Knock on the Door for Peace Talks, Trip North Postponed for One or Two Days on Orders, Huang Shaohong and Huang Xuchu Arrived in Nanjing to Meet Acting President Li to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Government Peace Representatives Huang Shaohong, a member of the Legislative Yuan, and Huang Xuchu, Chairman of Guangxi, flew to Nanjing from Wuhan by plane on the afternoon of the 5th. Acting President Li invited the two, as well as Shao Lizi and others, to a banquet that night, during which they exchanged views on the issue of peace.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] People close to Acting President Li said tonight that the Communist Party has given a reply to Li's peace proposal. This move is at least the first step in starting formal negotiations. Details of the Communist Party's reply are not known, but it is believed here that Li has finally managed to obtain direct contact with the Communist Party without having to publicly exchange views through radio stations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] People around Vice President Li openly expressed optimism about the future of peace on the 5th, but the reason for their optimism was hidden. On the surface, Li's mission to achieve peace between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is less obvious than it was a week ago when Premier Sun and others were in Shanghai, but Li's advisors are all showing trust, which shows that he at least hopes to persuade the Communist Party to start peace talks. The Beiping Communist Army's welcome of the Shanghai Peace Representatives is probably one of the reasons for their optimism. On the other hand, it is said that the Communist Army's failure to advance to the north bank of the Yangtze River has given Vice President Li's faction confidence that its efforts can succeed. The Communist Army's withdrawal and reorganization near the Yangtze River is obviously an order from the high command. If the Communist Party does not intend to seek peace, why would it order the army to stop attacking the Yangtze River basin?</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the matter of Yan Huiqing and others going to Beiping to meet with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party to convey the government's sincerity for peace, the government is currently conducting careful research on relevant issues. In order to make it more complete and detailed, the peace delegation, originally scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Beiping on the 6th, has decided to postpone its departure for one or two days on the orders of Acting President Li. Shao Lizi, who was originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 6th to fly to Beiping with Yan and others, has also postponed his trip to Shanghai due to the postponement of the delegation's trip. In addition, Gan Jiehou, who was sent by Acting President Li to Shanghai to contact Yan Huiqing and others to promote peace, is scheduled to return to Nanjing for a trip on the 6th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The candidates for the Shanghai Peace Delegation have been formally determined yesterday to be Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Jiang Yong, Ling Xianyang, Ou Yuanhuai, and Hou Debang, in addition to the three people Yan, Zhang, and Jiang who had already been decided, the other three were only agreed upon after Gan Jiehou came to Shanghai again to contact them this time. Ling Xianyang is the president of Shanghai University, Ou Yuanhuai is the president of Daxia University, and Hou Debang is the general manager of Yongli Company, representing the education and industry sectors respectively. In addition to the six members of the delegation, Shao Lizi and Gan Jiehou will participate in a personal capacity to assist with everything. Zhang Zhizhong was unable to go because the Soviet government had responded to the Xinjiang-Siberia trade agreement and needed to return to the Northwest for negotiations. The date of departure for the delegation must be determined after Gan Jiehou flies to Beijing again today to ask for instructions, but it is already known for sure that it will be very soon. It has been reported by Beiping that the Communist Party has prepared special rooms in the Beiping Hotel for the peace representatives and their secretaries to use, and that all transportation required for the special plane to land and for activities in Beiping has been arranged. The delegation plans to stay in Beiping for a week to exchange opinions extensively with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. All of the above points were formally announced by Gan Jiehou last night. Gan also stated: The main task of the delegation is to ask the Chinese Communist Party to quickly appoint representatives for peace talks and to determine the time and location for peace talks. As for who they will meet after arriving in Beiping, they will talk about it after they arrive, and in principle, the more the better, implying that they will see Ye Jianying first. He also emphasized that the delegation will be doing "door-knocking" work for future peace talks, and it is not a formal peace negotiation, let alone a negotiation on local peace, because today "the central government cannot discuss local peace, and local governments have no right to discuss local peace." Gan also announced that the transportation tool to Beiping was originally scheduled to be the Zhuiyun special plane, but now the Central and China Airlines have automatically expressed their willingness to send a plane to send the representatives to Beiping. Whether the Zhuiyun plane or the special plane of the two companies will be used will be studied and decided later.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Liu Pingjiang, Tao Baichuan, Ni Bi, and two other members of the Supervisory Yuan Peace Research Committee, visited Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong, who are about to fly to Beiping, at their residences yesterday afternoon to express the hopes of the Supervisory Yuan colleagues for peace and to fully exchange views on specific ways to promote peace.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 5th] Shanghai contacted Ye Jianying, Chairman of the Beiping Military Control Commission, by radio telephone on the 4th. Ye has agreed to receive the Shanghai Peace Delegation, but stipulated three points: (1) The talks must be kept secret and not disclosed to the press without permission. (2) No journalists are allowed to accompany them. (3) They should come to Beiping as people's representatives and not represent the government.</p>

<h3>Chen Cheng Invited Cheng Siyuan to a Banquet Yesterday Afternoon, Raised Opinions on Political and Military Reform, No Problem in Principle with Releasing Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 5th] Provincial Chairman Chen Cheng invited Cheng Siyuan to a banquet on the 5th, accompanied by Liu Keshu, He Zhonghan, and He Liankui. After the meal, the two had a long conversation. Cheng first explained the will of the central government in detail and solicited opinions on political, economic, and military reforms. Chairman Chen emphasized that whether for peace or war, the principle should be national unity, and it is still necessary to study. He will hand it over to the main secretary's office for handling after Cheng returns to Nanjing. As for urging Weng Wenhao and Sun Lianzhong to return to Nanjing, according to Cheng, Weng is currently in Tainan and is preparing to urge him by telephone. Sun will visit him within days. He does not plan to visit Zhang Xueliang during his stay in Taiwan.</p>
<h3>A China Airlines Plane Went Missing, It Has Landed in Yan'an with Passengers, The Company Plans to Submit Measures to Prevent Wrong Landings</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 5th] It is reported that the relevant authorities here have received a special telegram that a China Airlines plane that went missing, carrying 15 passengers, has safely arrived in Yan'an.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th] Liu Jingyi, General Manager of China Airlines, recently arrived in Taiwan from Hong Kong to inspect business and flew back to Shanghai on the 5th. According to people in charge of the company: Based on the judgment that the No. 135 passenger plane, which took off from Shanghai and made an intermediate landing in Jinan, had lost contact with the ground after takeoff, it is highly likely that it was "forced to land" in Jinan. The company has sent a telegram to Beiping, requesting the Jinan authorities to provide passengers with the convenience of leaving the country as much as possible, and to assist in repairing the plane if it is damaged and allow the plane to return. However, no response has been received so far. Since the plane made a wrong landing in Jinan, the company has now formulated three measures: (1) Find a way to prevent passengers from entering the pilot's room. (2) Request the government to allow pilots to carry pistols for self-defense. (3) Pilots must sign a series of guarantees. The above measures will be implemented once approved.</p>
<h3>General Badger's Flagship to Come to Shanghai Next Week, Adjustment of U.S. Navy in China, U.S. Marine Corps Activity Center Moves to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[United Press, this city] Vice Admiral Badger, Commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, confirmed on the 5th that he would order his flagship "Eldorado" to come to Shanghai in the middle of next week, and the temporary headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet under his command would come at the same time. However, Badger stated that this does not mean that the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet will be established in Shanghai. Badger answered the question of whether more U.S. Marines would come to Shanghai, saying: There are already U.S. Marines in Shanghai. If more are needed, more Marines will be sent to Shanghai. Badger's statement was made on behalf of Admiral Ramsey, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, who is making a routine inspection trip in China. Ramsey told the U.S. press that due to changes in the situation in China and a reduction in the naval budget, the U.S. Navy in China and the Pacific region has to be readjusted and redeployed. Ramsey also stressed Badger's previous statements that U.S. policy toward China is determined by the State Department in Washington, and the Navy is only an institution that implements its policy. Ramsey also said that the reduction in naval funding not only affects the Navy's position in China, but also affects all naval facilities in the Pacific region. At the same time, the time is not yet ripe to publish any documents on the details of the impact of this matter. It is necessary to re-evaluate the situation and start from a new foundation. This is a difficult problem that will be faced. It seems too early to say a new plan. The recommendation or implementation of this policy will depend on the need.</p>
<p>Ramsey also said that naval funding has been cut, and work in all regions of the Pacific region must be limited, and China is in this region. The number of future naval facilities in each region in this region will be determined by the Navy's need to execute the State Department's orders. Currently, one of the main parts of the State Department's policy on the civil war in China is to protect American expatriates. Badger reiterated that U.S. naval policy is to have enough U.S. Marines in any place to meet the needs of the situation. The question of enough is determined by urgent needs. Badger pointed out that in the past, the Tianjin area was in dire need of U.S. Marines to protect American expatriates. Most American expatriates have now withdrawn from that area, and in the future, Shanghai will be the center of activity related to the duties of the Marine Corps.</p>

<h3>Li Mingyang Went to Northern Jiangsu to Persuade, Ding Zhipan Thinks It Is Possible</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 5th] Regarding the saying that Li Mingyang, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Guerrilla Forces in the Border Area of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui, and now a Central Supervisory Committee member, went to Northern Jiangsu on the orders of Acting President Li a few days ago to contact the leaders of the Communist Army, the reporter asked Chairman Ding Zhipan about this. According to him: Because Li had a good relationship with the Communist Army generals in Northern Jiangsu in the past, it is very possible (according to the reporter, many mid-level and above cadres in the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu are former subordinates of Li).</p>
<h3>Communist Army Transfers Troops to Station in Yangzhou Rural Areas</h3>

<h3>If the Government is Willing to Fully Innovate</h3>
<p>— Xu Daolin</p>
<p>A Concrete Suggestion Regarding Administration</p>
<p>On the front lines, battles are lost, and soldiers die or are wounded by the tens of thousands, while the lives of high-ranking generals become ever more luxurious; common people are ruined, their families broken, and they are displaced, with hundreds dying daily of starvation and cold, while the wealth of powerful, corrupt officials grows daily. This is military and political affairs today.</p>
<p>Everywhere, in streets and alleys, are hung signboards of government offices, yet there is not a single person who earnestly manages the things that should be managed in society. At the central and local levels, there are tens of thousands of agencies, holding meetings and promulgating laws and regulations every day, formulating measures, yet the actual national economy and the people's livelihood remain as before, even deteriorating. Hundreds of thousands of civil servants, receiving meager salaries that are not enough to keep them warm or fed, walk in and out of government offices from morning till night, just turning somersaults through piles of official documents. This is administration today!</p>
<p>During the military suppression period, conscription of soldiers and collection of grain are, of course, the most important policies at the local level. Within a county, the monthly expenses of all agencies combined are not even equal to the difference in subsidies for food and fodder for one month, and the total annual budget is not equal to the resettlement fees for one conscript. What the government demands from the people is conscription, collection of grain, and apportionment; and what it gives them are refugees begging along the streets, roaming students stirring up trouble, veterans engaging in forced purchases and sales, and military dependents barging into homes, slamming tables, and breaking bowls. This is the life of the people in various localities today.</p>
<p>Why is the people's livelihood so difficult today? It is because of the successive military defeats over the past year. Why are military and political affairs so corrupt? It is because of the narrow-mindedness, hypocrisy, and selfishness of those in power. Why is administration so incompetent? It is because the current system makes personnel matters unreasonable.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, continuing in this way will only lead to things getting worse and worse, and more and more bitter, whether it be war or peace, nothing can be discussed. What I want to discuss now is: if the war situation can improve, or if peace talks can truly achieve a ceasefire, if those in power can make a mental shift and truly consider the welfare of the broad masses of people when deciding on policies, and truly use people based on their talents, ambitions, merits, and demerits, without regard to their factions or systems, speaking truthfully and acting truthfully, then in administration, how should we seek improvement?</p>
<p>I believe that a thorough and effective administrative reform should achieve the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Merge and Reduce Institutions</p>
<p>The various administrative institutions at the central and local levels that need to be reformed can be roughly divided into three types: one is permanent institutions that nominally have formal responsibilities but actually have no power or ability (mostly at the central level), another is temporary institutions that actually have power but are overlapping and redundant in nature (mostly in cities), and the third is a group of decorative institutions that are idle and exist only in name (mostly in localities). I will now analyze them as follows:</p>
<p>Permanent institutions (using square seals) often become powerless and incompetent because their main business, which is to deal with personnel matters, is often extracted and formed into separate institutions (such as land administration, health, and police being separated from the Ministry of Interior), or simply formed into temporary institutions (such as the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration outside the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Commander-in-Chief cum Administrative Governor outside the Provincial Government, and the Materials Bureau outside the Ministry of Finance). And these temporary institutions (using long seals), because their leaders are mostly favored by the current dynasty, and the matters they manage are urgent matters of the moment, naturally do not take their competent authorities seriously, so in addition to overlapping, they cause delays, and in addition to redundancy, they add to numbness. And the organization of these institutions themselves, because they are favored by the heavens, naturally have abundant personnel and generous funding, forming a huge, empty, extravagant, and wasteful special class in government agencies! As for some decorative institutions that exist only in name, most of them are established by important party and state figures to arrange personnel for factional gains. To place their subordinates, they universally set up descendant sinecures (divisions, bureaus, offices, sections) at all levels of localities. However, in reality, they cannot raise funds to carry out their business, nor can they find personnel who are trained and interested in these businesses, and there is no urgent need in the environment to handle these businesses. Naturally, these institutions have no choice but to be idle, neither alive nor dead, and spend their calm lives in a dim and boring way.</p>
<p>Because countless redundant institutions have been added year after year, and those many decorative institutions that exist only in name are unable to be filled, the competent authorities are unable to quickly and effectively solve problems, the processing time for official documents becomes increasingly long and cannot be shortened, the number of civil servants becomes increasingly large, and it becomes increasingly difficult to improve their treatment. As a result, administrative agencies generally become incompetent and wasteful!</p>
<p>To merge and reduce institutions, regarding the above-mentioned overlapping and redundant institutions, we should hire a number of fair-minded people who are knowledgeable in theory and well-versed in political affairs to form a committee—paying special attention to their neutral and objective standpoint—to conduct a thorough investigation of the work situation (business, funding, organization, purpose, efficiency) of these institutions themselves. Then, based on the obtained data and the relationship between them and the relevant permanent institutions, conduct detailed research and decide on their organizational adjustment. I believe that after this kind of reorganization, most of the current overlapping and redundant institutions can be abolished or merged, and most of the permanent institutions will become powerful and capable.</p>
<p>Regarding the abolition of all ineffective and nominal decorative institutions in localities, we should instruct the senior local authorities to designate fair and capable cadres to thoroughly investigate their work situation and carefully study their adjustment methods. Any institution that does not have sufficient funds to carry out its business, or does not have capable personnel to carry out its business, or does not have a suitable environment to carry out its business, should be abolished without exception. Do not be swayed by the beautiful names on their signboards and have any scruples or pity. If you keep a group of idle people alive and force them to become useless, it is not only unfair to other personnel, but also too inhumane to them.</p>
<p>(2) Reduce Personnel</p>
<p>Except for a few agencies where there are too few personnel and they are completely unable to do anything, it can be said that there is not a single administrative agency in the country that is not overstaffed, spending their time drinking tea, smoking, reading newspapers, talking and laughing, and dozing off. However, this is still the lesser of the harms. The unevenness of work and leisure leads to disharmony among colleagues, everyone has to find a way to put a stamp on official documents, making documents extra slow, and the work is too easy, creating a general atmosphere of laxity and lack of morale. This is the greater of the harms.</p>
<p>The method of reducing personnel should take the following steps: (1) Collect all the incoming and outgoing documents of an agency within a week and conduct a sampling inspection. (2) Based on the number and nature of the incoming and outgoing documents, calculate the number of people that the agency must have. —My standard: For staff members, they should be assigned at least three to five ordinary official documents per day; for clerks, they should copy at least 2,500 to 3,000 words per day—When calculating, allocate the responsibility for handling official documents to staff members based on the number of documents, allocate the responsibility for copying to clerks based on the number of words, and allocate the responsibility for administrative matters to administrative staff based on the number of staff members and clerks. (3) Finally, adjust the organization based on the number of necessary office personnel. —My standard: Five to ten staff members form a unit, three to five units form a section, and five to seven sections form a department or bureau. And among the current personnel, who should stay and who should go, all should be determined by open and fair methods such as examinations, performance reviews, and tests. After such an adjustment is made to each agency—determining the number of personnel based on the business, and determining the organization based on the number of personnel—I believe that at least two-thirds of the personnel can be reduced, and in many cases, I believe it can reach four-fifths.</p>
<p>We should allow all the personnel who are reduced in this way to continue to receive their original treatment (too many unemployed civil servants will cause serious social problems), but to find suitable outlets for them, we should organize various training classes and lectures in conjunction with the current needs of various villages in localities (we must solemnly find first-class talents to preside over them). Then, assign them a new and active job. My estimate is that the best outlets for these eliminated civil servants are adult literacy education, village education, guidance on rural sideline occupations, promotion of rural cooperation, and security officers, etc. With China's vast rural society, accommodating these people is not a problem. And as long as we can make these urban people return to the countryside to live, I guarantee that the national political economy will improve.</p>
<p>(3) Improve Treatment</p>
<p>Only after merging institutions and reducing personnel can we talk about improving treatment, and it can also be said that the latter is the purpose of the former two. If we do not improve the treatment of civil servants to a level that barely maintains their livelihood, and want to curb corruption and improve efficiency, it is like using a group of corrupt and incompetent civil servants and hoping for a clear government and a happy people, like climbing a tree to catch fish. If an agency, after merging and reducing, has only one-third or one-fifth of its original personnel left, I advocate that this group of elite cadres, in the midst of economic turmoil, should all be paid in hard currency (for example, from ten to two hundred yuan). Those who raise treatment locally can refer to the system of paying with grain (for example, from one dan to twenty dan). If we transfer the people's current burden for military affairs—conscript fees, differential fees, various temporary apportionments—to this improved treatment, it will be absolutely more than enough. At that time, we can take an absolutely unceremonious attitude and mentality towards this group of civil servants who receive improved treatment, and demand that they not be corrupt and not be incompetent. We can change incompetent ones at any time without worrying about no one answering, and we can severely punish corrupt ones, and those who receive it will die without resentment.</p>
<p>(4) Innovate Several Systems</p>
<p>Many new systems cannot achieve their original good purposes, but instead have many opposite and bad effects. We must now recognize the facts, muster our courage, and carry out innovation in a sweeping way.</p>
<p>(1) The Administrative Three-System Integration</p>
<p>Now, all agencies in the country are implementing the three-system integration, but in reality, what is consumed in terms of material resources is the amount of paper used for compiling and printing various plans and reports, printing and postage, and what is consumed in terms of human resources is the personnel designated by various agencies to specifically deal with the so-called design and assessment. And in terms of effectiveness, it is a 100% official-style participation! (Reviewing last year's work plan this year is also considered design; a small official stays in a big yamen, the minister invites him to a few meals, sends a little gift, and writes a report that is neither painful nor itchy, which is called assessment.) I advocate abolishing this system happily to save a lot of manpower and material resources and correct the atmosphere of high-pitched hypocrisy.</p>
<p>(2) The Qualification and Appointment System</p>
<p>In our personnel system over the past ten years, the selection aspect can be said to have achieved some success. People who have passed the high and ordinary examinations have a considerable level. The qualification and appointment aspect can be said to be a complete failure. Because this system has not produced any selection and division effects, it has forced out many fake works, fake diplomas, and fake certificates, and all large and small agencies at home and abroad are supporting tens of thousands of personnel who specialize in dealing with these fake diplomas and fake certificates. On the contrary, people with ability and integrity are unable to catch up with those who pretend to be impostors because they are unwilling to fake and deceive, or are even forced to leave their jobs because their qualifications do not meet the requirements, which is even more harmful. Originally, with the underdevelopment of education in China and the lack of widespread examinations, it is necessary to raise the employment qualifications of civil servants, and at a time when authority and responsibility should be concentrated in the hands of chief officials at all levels, it is necessary to restrict their power of appointment. For ten years, with foreign aggression and domestic troubles, wars and famines, displacement and migration, it is necessary to rigidly bind such and such documentary evidence. How can this system work? I believe that the current qualification and appointment system should be resolutely stopped. Each agency should have restrictions on the number of personnel and grades, but not on qualifications. The power of appointment belongs to the chief official, and the amount of treatment depends entirely on ability.</p>
<p>(3) The Accounting and Political System</p>
<p>In theory, it seems to be based on three premises: (1) All political, business, and administrative affairs of an agency can fully trust the chief official, but they cannot absolutely trust the chief official's use of money. (2) The integrity of the chief official must not be credible, but the integrity of the accounting personnel must be credible. (3) Ordinary people are subject to the instructions and manipulation of the chief official, while accounting personnel are "transcendent" and cannot be affected by anything. Whether these three premises are accurate can be answered by anyone who is slightly involved in political affairs. And in today's economic chaos, price instability, and currency depreciation, this accounting and political system, precisely because it is a necessary procedure for reimbursement, creates the best guarantee for corruption and fraud. The fact that the current accounting and political system cannot save money for the country and the people is a minor matter; the fact that it restricts and restrains those who really want to do things and prevents them from exerting their abilities is a major matter. The fact that tens of thousands of accounting personnel are supported for nothing is a minor matter; the fact that the flow of corruption and fraud, with complete documents and perfect procedures, can avoid legal sanctions and social criticism is a major matter. I advocate abolishing all accounting and political systems, abolishing all fixed accounting and auditing personnel (a few agencies that use a particularly large number of threads, of course, must think of other ways), and establishing several specialized auditing agencies at the central and local levels—must carefully select a few upright and incorruptible people—to conduct surprise spot checks at any time, check thoroughly and realistically, and handle strictly and harshly, so that those who do things can let go of their hands, and those who cheat cannot but be wary. I think maybe it is a better way (anyway, it will not be worse than the current situation).</p>
<p>(4) People's Opinion Institutions</p>
<p>According to the current national conditions, it is difficult to have a sound administrative agency, and it is also not easy to have a sound people's opinion institution. And according to the current situation of the administrative agency, the existence of a people's opinion institution is ultimately better than not having a people's opinion institution. However, it is not a good policy at present for administrative agencies to be excessively constrained by people's opinion institutions in their facilities. I advocate giving administrative agencies more freedom to establish facilities, and allowing people's opinion institutions to exert their supervisory and impeachment functions more.

<p>This Month's Household Rice Price Determined Advance Allocation of Ten Catties to End Mid-Month Mayor Guarantees Remaining Five Catties Will Be Redeemed After Mid-Month 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The price of household rice for this month in our city has been determined by the Economic Coordination Committee, with two types of prices: Whole rice is priced at 4,800 yuan per dan, and the priority allocation rice is priced at 4,020 yuan per dan. Broken rice mixed with whole rice is priced at 3,360 yuan per dan, and the priority allocation rice is priced at 2,820 yuan per dan. It will begin today (6th) and end on the 15th. Mayor Wu stated at a press conference at the City Hall yesterday at 5 p.m. that the household rice allocation for this month is designed with three coupons. Due to the slow loading and unloading of warehouses, it has been decided to first allocate and sell ten catties. The first and second coupons of the rice allocation certificate will be used first, and it is stipulated that the first coupon can purchase five catties of whole rice, priced at 160 yuan per person for five catties, and 134 yuan per person for priority allocation of five catties. The second coupon can purchase two catties of whole rice and three catties of broken rice, priced at 112 yuan per person for five catties, and 94 yuan per person for priority allocation of five catties. Citizens who do not wish to purchase broken rice may voluntarily give it up, and the first coupon can be used alone. According to Mayor Wu, the reason why the date for purchasing household rice this time is set to end on the 15th is that the City Government hopes that citizens will rush to buy it all within ten days, which will reduce the demand for rice in the market and stabilize rice prices. Wu also emphasized that the city's rice supply is more than ever before, and the current reserves are sufficient to supply the city for three months. The reason why only ten catties of rice are allocated this time is entirely due to transportation difficulties, and he hopes that citizens will not be suspicious. He guarantees that the other five catties of rice will be redeemed immediately after the 15th. Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Council Resident Committee Holds Meeting in Shanghai Decides to Elect Pang Shusen as Acting Speaker 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Council held its 14th Resident Committee meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday in the conference room of the Provincial Bank in this city. Committee members Chen Xuechen, Pang Shusen, Huang Sen, Xia Fengjun, etc., were present. Committee member Pang Shusen was elected as chairman. First, the Secretary-General of the Council, Xu Yuanruo, reported on seven items of Council affairs, and Director Chen of the Health Department reported on emergency response work. Then, the discussion began, and the following important cases were resolved: (1) Appointing Pang Diancai, Ling Shaozu, and Huang Sen to represent the Council at the peace conference convened by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Hubei People's Peace Promotion Association. (2) The 5th General Assembly of the Council was originally scheduled to be held on February 12th, but since Yangtai was abandoned, the focus of the provincial capital is shifting to Suzhou, and the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Council have not been legally elected. It was decided to postpone it to March 1st and hold it at the Council's location. (3) Since the Executive Yuan announced the approval of the resignations of Council Speaker Leng and Deputy Speaker Zhang, all Council affairs have been declared no longer responsible. Before the Speaker and Deputy Speaker are elected according to regulations, it was decided to elect Pang Shusen as Acting Speaker. Important temporary motions passed include: (1) At this extraordinary time, it is requested that the central government appoint a wise and capable person to replace the Jiangsu Provincial Chairman to comply with the public's wishes and benefit Jiangsu's administration. (2) Send a letter to the Provincial Government ordering all secondary schools to open before February 20th. (3) Send a telegram to the government requesting the cessation of conscription.

Various Municipal Organizations Jointly Telegraph the Speaker Expressing Opinions on Promoting Peace The Shanghai Municipal Council initiated the convening of the National Peace Promotion Conference, which will be held soon. The city's various national trade unions, educational associations, agricultural associations, women's associations, etc., to provide opinions for adoption, jointly telegraphed Council Speaker Shen and Deputy Speaker Xu yesterday. The original telegram is as follows: "Greetings omitted" Since your Council issued a telegram calling for the convening of the National Peace Promotion Conference on the 10th of this month, the provincial and municipal councils and civil organizations have risen up and responded unanimously, which shows that peace is the unanimous demand of the people across the country. Regardless of north or south, old or young, everyone detests the scourge of war and prays for the early realization of peace. However, it has recently been found that some people are advocating their so-called "partial peace," placing the entire country in disintegration, and trapping peace in inequality, in order to achieve their destruction of the realization of true and comprehensive peace, which is truly heartbreaking. This is what our people across the country resolutely oppose and cannot help but say. It is hoped that your Council and the representatives of the civil opinion organs and civil organizations participating in the Peace Promotion Conference in the provinces and cities will speak out loudly and unanimously advocate that peace must be comprehensive and negotiations must first cease fire. This is the blessing of peace and the fortune of the Chinese nation. Furthermore, the government's sincerity in seeking peace, compromising and seeking perfection, and repeatedly making concessions are all facts, which are seen by people at home and abroad. How has the CCP not ceased fire for more than a month, nor has it appointed representatives, determined the location and date, and even more so, has wantonly insulted and scolded in repeated broadcasts, which only hurts feelings and causes the door to peace to be opened, but negotiations have not yet been conducted, which is deeply regrettable. The National Peace Promotion Conference initiated by your Council is to represent the will of the entire people and to promote the realization of peace as its responsibility. It is hoped that concrete measures will be discussed quickly, calling on the CCP to immediately determine representatives, select a place for negotiations, and immediately cease fire, in order to save the people from water and fire and protect the national pulse from panting. As the nation's elites and opinion leaders are about to gather in Shanghai in the coming days to discuss peace, our association, etc., is speaking out for the people and presenting medicines for adoption, and we hope that you will take note." Small Industrial Loans in This City Can Still Be Applied For According to the City Industry Association, small industrial loans in this city can still be applied for after the Spring Festival. It is hoped that the various industrial trade associations will send the application forms and review opinions to the Central Bank's Discount Committee on the morning of the 7th. Those who have not received the application forms can contact the Technical Committee of the Industry Association at 115 Jiangxi Road to obtain them. It is also learned that emergency industrial loans have also been approved by the 24th meeting of the Discount Committee and can continue to be approved according to the previously determined review standards. However, those who have already received loans may not reapply. Provincial, Municipal, and County Native Place Associations Meet Yesterday to Discuss Appealing for Peace Representatives Will Be Sent to Contact the Communist Side National Provincial and Municipal Associations of Natives of Shanghai held their second joint meeting at the Shaoxing Native Place Association on Liuhe Road yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of appealing for peace. Representatives from 29 units, including Henan, Hebei, Taiwan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Northeast, Tianjin, and various counties and cities, attended. Liang Lieya (representative of Guangxi) was elected as chairman, and the following proposals were discussed: (1) Five representatives will be sent to the Communist side to negotiate peace. The candidates should not have party affiliation and should never have participated in political or party activities.

However, no cases are being accepted, and work is being rushed to wind up. Once the revocation order arrives in Shanghai, office work will stop. Jiang Ya Aftermath Committee Warehouse Victims' Ornaments Stolen Clean 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The Jiang Ya Wheel Tragedy Aftermath Committee warehouse downstairs of the Ningbo Native Place Association at 480 Xizang Road, stored eighteen travel bags, containing approximately 30,000 gold yuan, sixty-eight gold rings of various styles, two gold leaf pieces, three gold chains, six gemstone rings, two small diamond rings, four gold bracelets, one anklet, fifteen fountain pens, thirty-one watches, twenty-seven gold earrings, seven pocket watches, three silver dollars, and one platinum ring, all of which were objects of the victims salvaged from the sinking of the Jiang Ya. Yesterday morning at approximately 8 a.m., tea attendant Yang Quanhong suddenly discovered that the two large locks on the warehouse had been cut. After further discovery by economic coolie Wang Zuben, the batch of travel bags was moved to a small room behind the escalator. Some remaining pocket watches and fountain pens were left in the bags, but the rest were stolen. The incident was immediately reported to Chuan Longshan, the leader of the safekeeping team, who in turn reported it to the Lao Zha Police Sub-Bureau. Patrolman Tang Zhiliang and Sergeant Liu Zongtong were dispatched to investigate and took several tea attendants to the bureau for questioning to determine if there was any suspicion of internal theft. The investigation is currently underway. Zhong Weiquan, Already Sentenced to Death, Pays 2 Million Gold Yuan Bail 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Zhong Weiquan, chairman of the Hangzhou Rice Industry Association, was previously accused of raising rice prices and hoarding for speculation, and was sentenced to death by the Hangzhou Special Criminal Court. Recently, due to the closure of the Special Criminal Court, the Hangzhou Special Criminal Court transferred Zhong to the Shanghai Special Criminal Court for temporary detention. The Shanghai Special Criminal Court transferred Zhong to the District Procuratorate for investigation yesterday. After the prosecutor investigated, he ordered Zhong to pay a cash bail of 2 million gold yuan, and he was released on bail at approximately 5 p.m. yesterday. Profiteers Raise Prices and Manipulate Western Medicine Prices Rise Abnormally The soaring and chaotic market prices of Western medicines have been rare in the past. Citizens who unfortunately fall ill are greatly troubled. It is reported that the city's reserves of Western medicines are very abundant, and since the fall of North China's Beiping and Tianjin, the sales routes of the northern gangs have also been cut off. Southern China's Guangdong and Guangxi provinces all purchase locally from Hong Kong and the Philippines. The actual sales of Western medicines in this city have been cut off. The current crazy rise is entirely due to the manipulation and price increases by large speculative households. The relevant authorities should quickly seek effective measures to stop it. Nineteen Land Certificates Completed Owners Allowed to Retrieve Them 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Shen Zhenjia, Acting Director of the Land Administration Bureau, stated yesterday that nine-tenths of the land registration certificates in this city have been completed in the past, and the remaining one-tenth, approximately 10,000 pieces, are being actively cleared. Recently, due to the turbulent situation, citizens have been concerned about storing land registration documents in the bureau, so it has been decided to allow the owners to apply for retrieval, but a photo of the document must be retained. Also, there have been no personnel changes in the bureau. Only Wu Zunyang, Director of the Third Division, has been transferred to the position of Chief Secretary, and Xie Juntao, Secretary, has been transferred to the position of Director of the Third Division. Non-Motorized Vehicle License Plate Fees Revised 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The Public Utilities Bureau has heard that the various vehicle registration offices under the Public Utilities Bureau have revised the fee for replacing license plates for non-motorized vehicles for the 37th year. The bureau believes that the price fluctuations are too drastic, and the cost of making new plates is very high. Iron-wheeled freight cars and pedicabs that have already been retrofitted can be exempted from production and issuance, and the replacement of bicycle license plates can be re-registered by the various registration offices with newly compiled numbers. Other non-motorized vehicle license plate replacements will uniformly collect 140 gold yuan per plate and must be paid to the original registration office by the 20th of this month, and the replacement license plate will be collected at the end of the month. Fire in Jiangwan Barracks 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕A fire broke out in the western barracks on Jiangwan Changzhong Road yesterday evening. The flames soared into the sky. Although the soldiers bravely rescued, the effect was minimal. Later, the Jiangwan Hongzhen and other fire brigades and the Central Fire Department rushed to the scene with pump trucks to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished at approximately 8:30 p.m. The result was the destruction of five rows of barracks. Rampant Scalpers at the Wharf Two or Three Hundred People Destroy Company 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕At approximately 4 p.m. on the 3rd, Li Qin, a policeman from the 3871st patrol of the Penglai Police Sub-Bureau, was on leave and wearing plain clothes, with a service pistol (number 238774) in his waist. He visited a friend at the Xundao Street Police Station and left. When passing the Huayi Street intersection of the New Wharf, he saw thirty or forty people holding thin knives, iron bars, shoulder poles, and other weapons, running wildly. Believing that a brawl was about to occur, he followed behind to investigate. He was stopped by these people, which led to a conflict. Li's service pistol was snatched by the crowd. In the chaos, he lost his gold ring and fountain pen. Seeing that they had succeeded, these people fled to the 16th Pier Wharf. Li immediately rushed back to the sub-bureau to report. After investigation by the Criminal Section Chief Kui Damai, it was learned that this group of gangsters were scalpers (specializing in receiving stolen goods) on the 45th Pier of the 16th Pier. Because they had accumulated hatred with the workers of Shengji Company, they gathered two or three hundred people at the 16th Pier and destroyed the Shengji Company and the office of the warehouse. They also slashed and injured the company's personnel. The Yimiao Sub-Bureau learned of this and immediately sent a large number of police officers to arrest them, causing them to flee in disarray. Afterwards, accomplices Lu Jinbao and Wang Amao were arrested and taken to the bureau for investigation. The service pistol that was snatched was found in the house of Lu Jintang (i.e., Mu Amao), the owner of the Shengji Company, and was reported to the Yimiao Sub-Bureau, which sent it to the Penglai Sub-Bureau for review. Director of Education Bureau Holds Symposium Amount of Fees Determined for Public and Private Schools Principals Suggest Calculation Based on 6,000 Yuan Per Shi of Rice Submitted to the Mayor for Review and Approval for Public Announcement 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Li, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, held a symposium on tuition fees at Yucai Middle School at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. More than 100 people attended, including Municipal Council staff members Jiang Huaisu, Zhang Zhongyuan, Qu Yue, and representatives of principals, teachers, and staff of public and private primary and secondary schools. There was enthusiastic discussion at the meeting. A U.S. Senator suggested that the tuition fee standard be calculated based on the cost of living index, but this was opposed by the principals, who believed that the index was not practical. Senator Zhang suggested that tuition fees be paid in three installments, one installment every two months. Finally, it was decided that private schools would still use rice as the standard for fees, and convert the tuition fees of the previous semester into rice. Primary schools would charge 7.5 dou to 1.5 shi, junior high schools would charge 1.25 shi to 2.5 shi, and senior high schools would charge 1.75 shi to 3 shi. Whether to charge in installments would be determined by each school. The principals suggested that the rice price be converted at 6,000 yuan per shi. Director Li would ask Mayor Wu to decide. If Mayor Wu believes that 6,000 yuan is too high and wants to convert it at the current limited sales price of 4,800 yuan per shi, the principals requested that all the fees collected be sent to the mayor to allocate rice to the private schools at the price of 4,800 yuan. The fee standards for municipal schools have also been drafted, with senior high schools charging 1.6 shi, junior high schools charging 1.4 shi, and primary schools charging 9 dou to 1 shi, including teacher training funds. Because schools will need to open in the coming days, the above fee standards for public and private schools will be submitted to Mayor Wu for review and will be announced tomorrow. Law and Political Science Students Request Charging According to the Index 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Shanghai College of Law and Political Science, located at Zhongzheng South Second Road, has set the tuition fee for this semester at five shi of white rice. Most of the students at the school feel that the situation is difficult and the price of rice is soaring, making it impossible to afford it. They decided yesterday to unanimously request the school to charge according to the general tuition fee method for private universities, paying in installments according to the cost of living index. A general assembly will be convened at 2 p.m. tomorrow, and representatives will be sent to negotiate with the school. Jiaotong University Scheduled to Start Classes on the 7th An Emergency Response Committee Has Been Established 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Jiaotong University is scheduled to start classes on the 7th. The university's Emergency Response Committee has been formally established. The first committee meeting was held recently and passed the organizational charter. It was decided that the school authorities, the professors' association, the lecturers' and assistants' association, the staff's Lijing Society, the school workers' union, the students' union, and all the technicians would each nominate three representatives to form the committee. Under the committee are finance, materials, security, liaison, investigation, water and electricity groups. The fundraising target for emergency response funds is 800 dan of rice. However, the charity performance held at the school during the Lunar New Year did not yield good results due to low ticket prices and soaring prices. Furthermore, the university is scheduled to register from the 7th to the 12th and start classes on the 16th. National University Professors' Friendship Association Met Yesterday to Discuss Improving Treatment Sent Telegrams Calling for Action and Requested the Issuance of Emergency Response Funds 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The professors' associations of Jiaotong and Fudan Universities invited professor representatives from Jinan, Tongji, Shanghai Commercial College, Shanghai Medical College, Kindergarten Teachers College, and Tangshan Institute of Technology to hold the first meeting of the National University Professors' Friendship Association at Jiaotong University's Ronghong Hall at 3 p.m. yesterday. The meeting discussed the issue of improving professors' treatment and decided to send telegrams to Acting President Li, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education, explaining that the current monthly income of professors is only equivalent to one and a half silver dollars, and prices are still rising. They requested a quick improvement. In addition, they also requested the issuance of emergency response funds and grain storage funds for three months, all based on the price index at the time of payment. It was decided that Tongji and Fudan Universities would draft the above telegrams and send them out within days. In addition, it was agreed that each school would nominate a representative to contact the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance within days to urge the early allocation of funds. The second meeting of the association is scheduled to be held at Jinan University at 2 p.m. next Thursday, and will be held every week thereafter. The name of the association was originally intended to be the National University Professors' Association Federation, but because some schools still do not have professors' associations, it is now called the National University Professors' Friendship Association. Harvard Shanghai Alumni Association Scheduled to Hold Annual Banquet The Harvard alumni in this city recently re-elected the officers for 1949. Those elected are Cabot as President, Xu Weiming as Vice President, Baodemin as Secretary, and Qian Naixin as Treasurer. The association is scheduled to hold an annual banquet at the auditorium of the Bank of China on the 12th at 6 p.m. In addition to the handover ceremony for the new and old officers, Mr. Lai Puhan, Director of the China Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration and a current trustee of Harvard University, will attend and deliver a speech. Members of the association can contact Nie Guangdi of the China Insurance Bureau to reserve seats. If the Government Is Willing to Comprehensively Reform Continued from Page 2 (5) Judicial System Since the Anti-Japanese War, the most heartbreaking thing has been the decline in the reputation of the judiciary. This is the biggest hidden worry for the country's future, but unfortunately, it is not being taken seriously. The criticism of the judiciary is nothing more than two points: the backlog of cases, which often take years to resolve, makes people afraid to get involved, firstly. Arbitrary judgments, without responsibility, anyway, every case must go through appeal, causing people to lose faith, secondly. To save the situation, I intend that funds be raised by various localities, combined into hard currency or rice, to form a judicial fund. The presidents of courts at all levels should be responsible for gathering judges, or additionally hiring experienced lawyers, to form a temporary committee, responsible for clearing the backlog of cases. At the same time, it should be stipulated that judges who handle new cases and complete them within a certain period should receive certain bonuses. The above two types of expenses will be paid by this judicial fund. Furthermore, the judicial system should stipulate that judges should be responsible for questioning cases and making judgments. Any judge who has several cases overturned on appeal should be dismissed from his position, and his judicial officer and lawyer qualifications should be revoked at the same time. On the one hand, the appeal fees should be increased to prevent the general public from using them to delay time. The use of the jury system is even more worthy of our research and promotion. (5) Stop Promulgating Laws and Regulations and Use Orders I believe that if the government is determined to reform, it should decide not to promulgate any laws or regulations within a year. In the past twenty years, half in peacetime and half in wartime, all the laws and regulations that have been promulgated can be said to be all-encompassing and all-inclusive. But where is the effect that has actually occurred? If the laws and regulations are all effective, looking at a set of domestic affairs laws and regulations, what kind of rule of law country should China be? We are not lacking laws and regulations now, but there are too many laws and regulations; it is not that our laws are not good, but that our laws are not effective. The reason why they are not effective is because they are made behind closed doors and are not practical; it is because the upper-level agencies at all levels, on the one hand, pay too much attention to control, and want to use laws and regulations to bind the lower levels everywhere, and on the other hand, they are afraid of taking responsibility, and want to use laws and regulations to replace orders everywhere, that is, they are willing to admit the imperfection of a certain law or regulation they have formulated, but they are unwilling to admit the inappropriateness of a certain thing they have handled. Therefore, I advocate that all agencies should not promulgate any generally applicable laws and regulations in the future, but should retain all the laws and regulations of the past for reference when implementing policies. At the same time, all agencies with responsibility and authority should be held responsible for handling matters in full authority. They are not allowed to ask the higher-level agencies for instructions unless it is absolutely impossible to decide. The higher-level agencies are only allowed to issue instructions through orders based on the time, the matter, and the reason. They must not use the excuse of laws and regulations or precedents as the basis for their approval or disapproval. (At least we should give each administrative agency the power to appropriately change the existing laws and regulations when there is a legitimate reason.) In this way, if anything happens, no one will be left to handle it, and the person in charge cannot shirk the responsibility for the quality of the handling. Any matter, the handling agency, and the higher-level agency can and must handle it appropriately according to the time, the situation, and the reason, and will not and dare not use the four words "it concerns a general case" to block and cope with everything. (6) Steps of Reform When it comes to administrative reform, we must clearly understand that the key to everything lies in the people who actually implement it, that is, everything lies in the administrative leaders in various places. I not only advocate that each province should have its own reform methods, and each county should have its own reform methods, but also advocate that everyone may have their own reform methods. How China's entire destiny will be in the future depends entirely on the situation in each province, and how the situation in each province depends entirely on the situation in each county, and how the county government is everything depends on the county magistrate. If we want to improve the county government, we must be able to get people of great importance to be county magistrates. I believe that being able to have a few more people who have served as ministers and vice-ministers with excellent performance to serve as county magistrates will bring immeasurable benefits to the country. We want them to go, not because we want them to be county magistrates for the sake of being county magistrates, but because we want them to be able to bring several important cadres with them to research and experiment, improve, and create. I believe that a county magistrate of the ministerial level, with four or five cadres of the division chief level and seven or eight cadres of the section chief level, can certainly put everything in this county - household administration, police administration, financial administration, grain administration - in order in a important county in six months to eight months, and arrange everything in a workable scale in terms of systems - organization, personnel, and expenses. At this time, we will disperse the capable cadres here - the original old cadres, plus the newly absorbed and trained cadres - to several neighboring counties, and use the experience gained and the skilled hands to promote effective methods. In this way, spreading gradually from small to large and from near to far, I believe that a province will be able to achieve a small success in less than three years. Then, using the cadres of this province to promote in neighboring provinces, within five years, the whole country will be transformed. By that time, the central government, which is high above, will not be able to govern, even if it wants to. The above discussion is limited to general administrative reform. As for the many problems in the military and economic aspects, I will leave them to those who have more research than me to discuss. I will not speak presumptuously. Yesterday Evening's Basketball League Hualian Wins After Hard Fight Defeats Mailing By Two Points Result 61 to 59 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕In yesterday evening's exciting basketball league game, Hualian defeated Mailing by two points, 61 to 59. In the first half, Hualian also went through a hard battle to catch up with Mailing, which can be said to be a very dangerous win. Hualian's performance was lackluster, perhaps due to the cold weather. Mailing had tall players, and Hualian's use of low passes did not yield good results. Da Li did not play, and Wu Chengzhang was injured, both of which affected their strength. In the first half, Mailing took the lead with 10 to 5 and 15 to 5, Hualian was behind by as much as ten points, and only caught up by one point in the first half, 33 to 32. In the second half, Adi came on with an injury, and Le Jiazhou and Shuzhong led the team to a 48 tie, and then each reached 50, 57, and the situation was difficult to separate. Liang Xiong scored two consecutive goals, and Hualian finally won with 61 to 59. More than 2,000 spectators in the gymnasium expressed their satisfaction.

A Certain Lady Enthusiastically Helps Education Generously Donates More Than Three Taels of Gold Jewelry Since "Anonymous" generously donated 100,000 yuan the day before yesterday, our newspaper-sponsored "Reader Scholarship Fund" received another donation yesterday from a female reader in person, who generously donated three pieces of gold jewelry in the name of "A Certain Lady," weighing more than three taels and two fen, setting a new donation record. It is said: "I have always sympathized with poor students, and I greatly admire Shen Bao's long-standing advocacy of scholarship movements and its efforts to help poor and out-of-school students. Therefore, I am donating three pieces of gold jewelry that I have collected to the scholarship fund, hoping to do my best for the students. I also hope that female comrades from all walks of life will respond enthusiastically." Before leaving, she repeatedly entrusted us to not seek false fame for doing good deeds and asked us not to publish her real name. While accepting the donation, our newspaper is deeply grateful and sincerely hopes that enthusiastic men and women from all walks of life will continue to make donations, which will be of great benefit to the future of education. In addition, Shi Wenchao, a reader of our newspaper, gave his second daughter in marriage and transferred the congratulatory gift of 5,900 yuan to the scholarship fund. This is also recorded with thanks. Shooting to Arrest Deserters Stray Bullets Kill and Injure Two People 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕At approximately 9 a.m. yesterday, a deserter ran from west to east on Zhonghua Road in Nanshi, followed closely by four soldiers. When turning into the intersection of Yinggong Temple Road, the four soldiers who followed immediately pulled out their guns and fired more than ten shots, hitting the deserter in the chest with one bullet, causing him to fall to the ground and be captured. At the same time, as the bullets flew, stray bullets killed and injured one man and one woman. It was later learned that the deceased was an old woman, Wang Fangshi (72 years old, from Ningbo, living at 985 Zhonghua Road). The injured was Li Jiayu, 18 years old, from Shandong. The injured was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. The corpse was taken to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for examination by hearse. The police are ordering police to investigate which unit the deserter belongs to. International Telephone and Telegraph</p>
<h3>京民生報被誤封　呈請衛戌部啓封</h3>
<p>[Local News] When the Nanjing Renbao newspaper was sealed, the furniture, equipment, and machinery originally belonged to the Minsheng Daily. This was because Nanjing Renbao borrowed some furniture from the Minsheng Daily's president, Cheng Shewo (Legislative Yuan member), last year, with a promissory note as proof. The remaining houses, furniture, and other items still belong to the Minsheng Daily. During the execution of the sealing, they were sealed together. Now that the president of the Minsheng Daily has moved south with the Legislative Yuan, the newspaper's administrative director, Mi Zhemin, has submitted a written request to the Garrison Headquarters to lift the seal.</p>

<h3>中航籌恢復菲星兩航綫　華南綫視需要隨時增闢</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th] According to the person in charge of China Aviation Company (CAC), as domestic routes are becoming shorter, the company is first planning to restore the Manila route. This matter has been approved by the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry has appointed officials to go to the Philippines to reopen negotiations with the Philippine government. As soon as passports are processed, the trip can be made. The company also plans to restore the route from Hong Kong via Bangkok to Singapore, which is still being discussed with the Ministry of Communications for approval. If flying directly from Hong Kong to Singapore, it must pass through Bangkok, which is what the company intends to resume. As for the Batavia route, it cannot be opened for economic reasons. The Australian route still awaits the signing of an aviation agreement between the two countries. Regarding the reporter's inquiry about whether to add South China routes, the person replied: "This is very easy. If there is a need, South China routes can be added at any time." The problem of mutual flights between China and the Philippines was previously shelved because the Philippines insisted that China allow Philippine planes to land in Xiamen, which was not agreed to by the Chinese government. In the past, the route that once implemented mutual flights was the China Aviation aircraft flying from Shanghai via Shantou to Manila, and the Philippine aircraft flying from Manila via Hong Kong to Shanghai. Later, the Philippines requested to add a stop in Xiamen. China believed that the conditions of Xiamen Airport's equipment were not sufficient to become an international airport, so it did not agree. The Philippines then announced that China Aviation aircraft would not be allowed to continue flying to Manila.</p>

<h3>大西洋公約草案大體完成　下星期內即可公布　規定簽約國如遭侵略一致採制裁行動　挪外長啓程赴美參加討論</h3>
<p>The Atlantic Pact Draft is Largely Completed; It Can Be Announced Within the Next Week; It Stipulates that Contracting Countries Will Take Concerted Sanction Actions If Attacked; Norwegian Foreign Minister Departs for the United States to Participate in Discussions</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] According to diplomatic sources: The United States and the six countries negotiating the North Atlantic Treaty plan to announce the outline of the treaty's secret provisions next week. They revealed that agreements have been reached on various key points, and the detailed provisions to be revealed are being discussed by the seven countries: the US, Canada, UK, France, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. According to reliable sources, the treaty will consider an attack on any member state as an attack on all, and take immediate action against the aggressor. This action is not necessarily military intervention, and may take the form of diplomatic and economic sanctions against the aggressor country or army. The previous provision that member states would assist friendly countries with military action has been abandoned due to strong opposition from all participating countries. For example, the United States must obtain special Congressional approval to enter the war. According to the new treaty, the parliaments of each member state can decide whether to participate in the war. The treaty is valid for sixteen years, and will be renewed upon expiration. Under the treaty, a North Atlantic Security Council will be established, but it will not have the power to order member states to participate in the war. The United States began considering this treaty in June of last year. The formal text is expected to be signed by the foreign ministers of the seven draft countries and any countries that decide to join at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. Officials here believe that there is still an opportunity for Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Portugal, and Italy to participate in this treaty before the treaty is formally announced. It is also said that Ireland has no hope of participating at this time. This treaty is the first peacetime alliance between the United States and Western European countries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Oslo, 4th] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange is scheduled to leave here tomorrow with the Norwegian Ambassador to the United States. The former leader of the Labor Party parliamentary group and two former Ministry of Defense officials will also accompany him.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Diplomatic officials said that an important meeting between Norway and the United States regarding the North Atlantic Treaty will begin here soon. They said that the State Department received a note on the afternoon of the 4th, stating that the Norwegian delegation will come to the United States to determine under what conditions Norway may participate in the defense alliance.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 4th] Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson said in the House of Commons on the 4th that the rumor that Canada was invited to join the Pacific Alliance was purely "speculation." He said, "No government has made such a suggestion to us, and we are not aware of any suggestions regarding the Pacific Alliance."</p>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] Former colleagues of Gromyko at the United Nations expect this young Deputy Foreign Minister to take on a larger role in the Soviet Foreign Ministry. Since Gromyko retired from Lake Success last summer and returned to Moscow to take on a new position, his activities have become a mystery to most diplomats. Few people here believe that this 39-year-old senior Moscow diplomat will remain unknown for long. It is speculated here that Gromyko will succeed Vyshinsky as the most prestigious First Deputy Foreign Minister. United Nations personnel believe that Foreign Minister Molotov will take on a larger role in the Soviet government.</p>
<p>If Molotov is not the first favorite under Marshal Stalin, he is one of the few on Stalin's right hand, as Molotov has been nominated as one of Stalin's successors. A change in Molotov's position would elevate Vyshinsky to Foreign Minister, if his health allows. United Nations representatives who saw Vyshinsky's actions and eloquence at the recent Paris General Assembly believe that Vyshinsky is the best candidate. An American publisher who recently returned from Moscow said during a visit to the United Nations that he was convinced that Vyshinsky would take the position of Foreign Minister, but the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General and Soviet representative, Sobolev, offered little support for this. United Nations observers believe that it is significant that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith visited Gromyko for a long talk when he left his post, which indicates that former United Nations representative Gromyko is now responsible for US-Soviet relations in the Moscow Foreign Ministry.</p>
