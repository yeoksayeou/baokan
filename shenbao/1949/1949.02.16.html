<h3>答覆對和平前途詢問　李代總統表示樂觀　監委希望政院遷回南京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕李代總統對和平前途極具樂觀，渠於十五日晚答覆本報記者所詢對和平前途是否具有把握時，笑容滿面，運稱：「有把握，有把握」。惟以時間關係，未盡透露其有把握之理由，李代總統係於十五日晚九時蒞臨中央廣播電台，作視事後首次對全國軍民廣播，前數分鐘時，接見本報記者，僅作極匆促之談話。記者詢以對和平問題之看法時，李代總統稱：此事有待吾人之努力。關於中共方面一再延宕時間，李代總統似未予重視，惟稱：「你們可以看吧」，作此語時，充分表現其信心。據李代總統稱，渠尚未接到已抵北平之顏惠慶，邵力子諸氏之報告。李代總統廣播，係於下午九時正開始，歷時十一分鐘，李代總統以徐緩之廣西官話，對全國軍民加以勗勉，詞畢卽匆匆登車，逕返官邸。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕李代總統十五日晚六時在總統府邀宴監院于院長，劉副院長及全體在京監委，到五十餘人。七時半復在官邸宴請首都衛戍總司令張銀明，京市長滕傑及冷欣等。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕在京監委十五日晨於院會中決定，下午秘密舉行談話會，就當前時局交換意見，屆時出席監委四十餘人，仍由于右任主持，會中討論，着重行政院遷穗及孫院長個人問題，關於政院遷穗手續不合，監院已提出糾正案，迄尚未獲答覆，現決定再催政院作答，俾決定第二步驟，關於孫院長個人者，各委員以外間所傳者甚多，如孫院長出售陵園官邸及某女性在滬出售房屋，以及孫氏在穗撥四萬美元捐助中山大學等，咸主加以調查，如有其事，監院應有所表示，如無其事，監院亦可發表聲明，澄淸謠言，對孫氏個人信譽，亦有幫助。當經決定授權于院長，指定委員從事調查。關於立院開會地點及政院應行遷回南京問題，會中亦有討論，一般希望政院能遷回，同時各委員決以私人之努力促成立院在京復會及政院遷回南京</p>
<p>盛傳孫院長辭職　曾有函件托于院長携京</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕首都十五日盛傳孫科院長以血壓過高，已向李代總統提出辭呈，李代總統業經去電慰留，記者十五日晚向有關方面探詢，謂並無其事。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十五日電〕行政院長孫科十五日下午四時召集在穗立委，舉行座談，內容嚴守秘密，無從獲悉。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十五日電〕監察院長于右任稱，余自廣州返京，擕來行政院長孫科之函件，因健康關係，請求李代總統准予息養。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十五日電〕可靠方面十五日稱，行政院長孫科提出辭職，係因李代總統在其與中共謀取政治解決的努力中，獲得更多之支持，使因戰爭而支離破碎的中國的和平希望漸形增大。若干立法委員及其他政府人士均認爲，孫氏堅持將行政院遷穗，爲「和平之阻礙」。大多數立委要求在京復會及監察院本日在京召開月會，對孫氏之地位不啻爲一種嚴重打擊。當李宗仁就任代理總統之初，卽面臨極端份子的不合作精神，但現已在政府內部日漸獲得支持，何應欽將軍之抵京，已予李代總統控制軍隊使勿採取可能與其和平政策相反行動之更多權力，特別是京滬地區的國軍，因湯恩伯將軍卽係何氏舊部。</p>
<p>〔合衆社香港十五日電〕據廣州消息，李代總統可能要求何應欽將軍繼任行政院長。</p>
<h3>整肅官常和軍紀　李代總統勗勉文武官員革新政治解除人民痛苦</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕李代總統十五日晚九時在中央廣播電台對全國文武公教人員及前方將士播講，原詞如下：</p>
<p>全國各級公務人員和全國陸海空軍將士們：</p>
<p>自我主政那天起，鑒於這一個艱鉅的歷史任務有所付予我的責任非常重大，使我時時感到惶恐和不安，我不能不竭智盡忠，以無負國家和人民的期望。爲顧念國家的艱難和人民的痛苦成就，決定在最短期間，我們的政府必須完成兩項爲全國人民所迫切要求的重要任務：第一，是謀取和平，第二，是革新政治。關於前者，我在迭次文告中，曾經加以說明，今天我要對諸位講的，便是革新政治這個問題，同時，我要告訴諸位，政府現在己決心努力朝這方向開始去做，而且將不顧一切困難，排除一切障得，務必達到目的而後已。關於革新政治這個問題所包括的當然很廣泛，但是我以爲，目前最切要，最起碼的，就在整肅官常和軍紀，換言之，就是要先從全國軍政人員的心理上和行爲上的革新做起，因爲沒有健全的工作人員，便無從建立良好的政治風氣，古人說「其身正不令而行，其身不正雖令不行」，就是這個道理。關於這些話，我相信不僅你們的長官已經向你們說過，同時，我更相信你們自已也一定共同成覺得到，但是從今天起，我們決不僅是說說而已，更重要的，是要大家切切實實，身體力行。</p>
<p>現在我們的國家殘破到如此地步我們的人民遭受如此不堪忍受的痛苦，不僅是國家建設無法着手，甚至於抗戰勝利後國家可能復興的一綫生機也已經瀕於滅絕，不僅是人民的幸福無法增進，而且連最低限度的生活都不能維持，這個原因究竟在那裏，當然我們不否認，這是由於多年來對外，對內戰爭所造成的結果，但是我們爲國家人民服務的人，沒有能夠盡到職責，卻是無可諱言的事實，而且更進一步的，還有少數人在擾害人民，剝削人民，增重人民的痛苦，試問我們大家身受國家俸祿和人民的供養，而竟不能替人民解除痛苦，增進福利，反而忍心書理，營私肥己，這如何對得住國家和人民，更如何對得住自己的良心。許多人批許我們政府是食污無能，我以為這不是「無的放矢」，也用不着「諱病忌醫」，我們唯有坦白地承認以往的錯誤，檢討以往的缺點，拿出勇氣和決心，澈頭澈尾從新做起，才能挽回國家劫運，解除人民痛苦，進而建設國家，造福人民。（下接第二版）</p>
<h3>京市參議會決議電促孫院長返京</h3>

<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕京市參會十四日決議，電請行政院孫院長暨各部會首長，返京主持公務，並另電于童兩院長暨全體立監委，促請立監兩院早日在京復會。</p>
<h3>李漢魂抵京</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕新任海南行政長官兼海南省籌委會主委李漢魂，十五日下午由漢飛抵京，晚十時半由總統府侍衛長李宇淸陪同晉謁李代總統，有所報告。</p>
<h3>顏惠慶等抵平消息　中共作簡單報道　—對顏等未加和平代表頭銜—</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十五日廣播：和平代表團顏惠慶等一行，已由靑島平安飛抵北平，中共電台十五日僅以極簡單詞句加以報道，而並未以和平代表之頭銜加諸顏等，僅謂：「顏惠慶·邵力子·章士釗·江庸·黃啟漢連同機師等，於十四日下午五時飛抵北平。顏等係十三日由滬飛靑，十四日轉道來平一。</p>
<h3>太原糧食問題嚴重　閻錫山昨蒞滬午後原機飛京　當晚謁本代總統報吿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕閻錫山將軍於十五日晨八時專機抵滬，此爲十五年來閻氏對本市之首次訪問，事前嚴守秘密，知者甚鮮。抵達後，卽驅車往訪賴樸輸氏，但因賴氏定十六日首途赴美，忙於摒檔雜務，未往辦公，故閻氏僅與經合分署副署長葛里芬及署畏之特別助理米克瓊格蘭脫等晤談，會商之中心爲太原空投問題。過去太原不在美援食糧補給範圍之內，而靑島方面因汽油缺乏，今後空運接濟太原，困難甚多，凡此均爲閻氏來滬洽商之主題。昨日午間，山西旅滬同鄉曾公宴閻氏，藉表敬意。午後三時半，閻氏原機赴京，訪謁李代總統。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕太原緩署主任閻錫山將軍，爲太原糧食問題嚴重，須親自向中央請示解決辦法，於十四日自并乘機抵靑島，十五日上午八時自靑飛抵滬，復於十五日下午五時半自滬乘機飛抵京，專機降落明故宮機塲，何應欽·徐永昌·顧祝同·桂永淸·郭懺·秦德純·孫楚等數十人均赴機塲歡迎，李代總統亦派總統府侍衛長李宇淸代表赴機塲迎迂。閻氏下機後，與各歡迎者一一握手，並在機塲中與何應欽·徐永昌略事寒暄，卽驅車赴上乘庵山西省府辦事處，與在北平之郭宗汾通話，晚七時半，何應欽·徐永昌·顧祝同在鬥鷂閘何氏私邸聯合設宴爲閻將軍洗塵，並邀先一日抵京之太原綏署副主任孫楚·楊愛源及桂永淸·郭懺等作陪。晚九時半，閻氏晉謁李代總統，報告太原糧食問題嚴重情形，及太原綏署轄區軍政近況，談至十一時始行辭出，並于十一時往訪顧祝同，于晚十二時返寓。閻氏在京將有二三日勾留，卽行返并。李代總統定十六日午歡宴閻氏。</p>
<p>據隨閻氏同來之人士談，閻氏此來係因太原糧食問題嚴重，特向中央請示具體迅速之解決辦法，太原糧食係賴中央空運接濟，所需之糧食，政府在上海及靑島均已儲備，唯因汽油缺乏，空運數量甚爲有限，現太原存糧僅足敷三五日之用，而運糧飛機又因汽油問題有暫停之虞。閻氏於十四日曾派孫楚飛京請示解決辦法，孫氏離并後，空運方面傳出消息，靑島飛往太原之運糧機十五日起可能暫停，間氏逐臨時決定乘運糧機飛往靑島，由靑復飛抵滬，十五日在滬曾與聯勤部張副總司令，財長徐堪，美經合署駐華分署副署長葛里芬等會商空運糧食至太原及撥款購汽油問題，已獲有部份結果。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島十五日電〕太原空運因汽油不繼，於十一日起停止，晉省駐靑人員通日積極交涉，聞已可向靑空軍借用汽油。據悉，十六十七日可恢復。</p>
<h3>改用銀元說無稽　徐堪昨召集滬金融領袖會議　交換經濟新方案意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財畏徐堪，十四日午後二時抵滬，十五日晨偕央行總裁劉攻芸訪侯行將赴美述職之賴普漢氏，就美援事有所洽商。徐氏並於上午十一時召集本市金融界首領，進行會議。據聞，徐氏此行主要使命有兩，一爲研究擴大推銷短期黃金公價，並完成基金保管委員會之組織；二爲就行將公佈之經濟新方案，與此間金融界交換意見。因徐財長之來滬，此間盛傳幣制將再度改革，改用銀圓，惟經記者詢之國行發行局負責人士，均謂未有所聞，而據渠等私人意見，目前發行銀圓實無可能，所謂造幣廠於一週前開鑄錫圓之說，實屬無稽。當局爲增強幣信起見，曾不斷拋售物資，抽緊銀根，數日來物價之平疲，具見此項政策之效果，今後將繼續執行，除此以外，尚未考慮其他措施。</p>
<h3>閻錫山談大局　和戰大計決於中央太原不作北平第二</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕閻錫山將軍十五日深夜於首都飯店接見本報記者，據稱，渠此次來京，係爲太原民食問題向當局請示，十五日晚晉謁李代總統時，代總統表示不中央決盡力設法供給，並繼續空運，具體辦法卽將與有關機關商定。記考詢以對於局部和平及中共所提和談八條件之看法？閻將軍稱，和戰大計決於中央，渠決以中央之意志為依歸。記者詢其太原是否將尋求局部和平時，閱將軍以堅定之語句稱，太原決不做北平第二，余負防守太原之職責，決不放棄責任。閻氏並進而以人身爲喻，謂人之神經中樞始可決定全身之活動，如發號施令者非神經中樞面顯四肢之一部，則此卽不正常，亦不應該。閻氏率直指山局部和平是不對的。記者詢以對於傳作義氏在北平所作局部和平之看法，閻氏以不明北平環境為理由，避免作答覆。詢及中共所提之八條件是否能使和談成功時，關氏笑謂：中共所提八條件兀全是以戰勝者處置戰敗者之條件，眞正之和平談判，實難於此八條件中獲得成功。最後，閻氏並表示天下事全在人爲，國家前途仍屬有望。長仍返京與李代總統共策進行和談之事·孫氏尤表示政院重要人士俟廣州方面部署後決去京，惟彼個人因血壓過高，不便前往。其次童氏報告本月七日在穗與留穗立委同人交換意見之經過，末報告穗生活程度及立院在穗之部署，並稱復會地點不論在京。在穗，吾人之意志必須一致，必須團結，完整，統一，以領導將來之政治，否則勢成分裂，卽是和抑戰亦無所適從，希各同人鄭重考慮之。旋各委員發言，情緒激昂，至四時半散會。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕立院大致將於廿五。六日在京復會，各地出席立委於廿一日開始報到，院長童冠賢一二日後返京，籌備復會事宜。</p>
<h3>美報之報道　大量鎢砂自華運美</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十王日廣播：「世界電訊」載稱：在最近數星期中，中共新近佔領區域中之大量鎢鐵鑛自中國口岸運抵紐約。該項鎢鐵鑛係運交聯邦供應局國防材料組，將儲備政府重要生產之需。該報續稱：據海關職員謂，此項貴重鑛石何時大量輸入紐約，巳不可記憶。其中一艘貨船約於十天以前到達，載有鎢鐵餓三百七十萬磅，另一艘運來一百萬磅，第三艘運來三百二十萬磅，其他貨船尚在途中，據稱亦載有大量鎢鐵鑛。某進口商認爲是項鑛石之大量運美，係恐共產黨不久將控制中國全部之故云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕立法院第三會期決定依法於二月中集會，地點並決定在南京，此爲立法院院長童冠賢於十五日下午召集留滬立委微詢意見後所作之結論。按會中各委員發言，均強調立院團結統一之重要，至集會日期，則俟童院長及秘書處就交通及發出通知等各項問題準備就緒後再予確定。童院長係十五日晨自京抵滬者，下午三時於新生活俱樂部召集留滬立委舉行談話會，計出席委員一百廿七人，首由童院長報告穗行經過，並首先聲明，對於立院集會地點，在穗·在京均無成見，同時否認報載渠赴穗任務有邀孫科院長赴京之說。糧童氏說明在穗期間曾與孫院長及其他重要人士聚談三次，其對政府遷地辦公之意見一致認爲在和談進行之期，而首都尚未受軍事威脅之前，在穗有所部署後，政院部會首</p>

<p>〔本報漢口十五日電〕記者今午訪晤聯勤總部第九補給區司令朱鼎卿氏，探詢鄂省府改組問題。朱氏避作肯定答復，但以謙虛口吻稱：「余無行政經騐，實不敢率爾操觚，惟今日處境已不容吾人選擇工作」。另據接近張主席者談，省府改組卽可見諸事實，刻張主席已囑各廳處準備趕辦移交。</p>

<h3>中蘇商約談判與新疆問題</h3>
<p>中央自任命飽爾漢爲新疆省主席，及派張治中將軍回西北與蘇聯迪化總價事談判中蘇商約以來，中蘇的陰沉的空氣逐漸衛朗了。據聯合社廣州電稱：中蘇商約談判尚在試探階段。惟據路透社南京電稱：蘇聯和新疆間關於成立經濟協定的初步商談，已在迪化舉行完畢，經過良好，推內容未予透露。據路透社估計其內容，蘇聯最早要示開採新疆礦產，包括煉鋼用的老干金屬。如果這個估計不錯，是則中蘇商約的內容，可能是以新疆礦產開採權的議予，換取蘇聯若干經濟上的互惠，從而建立新疆和蘇聯間的友好關係，更進而發展中蘇間的友好關係。我們站在親仁善鄰，對外和平友好的立場，自然對於中蘇商約初步談判的成功，表欣慰。</p>
<p>中國和蘇聯，本爲大陸上兩個獨立大國，無論從地理歷史及經濟關係說，中蘇兩國都應維持一種友好關係的。中蘇外蒙相鄰的境界，佔中國全部境界綫的一半，西起帕米爾，北經阿爾泰山，蒙古沙漠，及黑龍江烏蘇里江上，而東至圖門江口，均爲中蘇境界相鄰之處，同時也是疆界糾紛最多之處。一個世紀以來的糾紛，或因境界未定，或因境界雖定而界碑生足，或對條約文句解釋不同，或因日偽與蘇蒙對境界有所變更，而爲中國對蘇蒙所不承認。本來相處於一個國際社會裏，相鄰的兩國易有邊境糾紛，原不足怪。所可憾者，中蘇蒙邊界糾紛，往往是政治糾紛擴大的說明，致兩國在外交上經濟上發生若干不必要的衝突和摩擦。從一個國家立塲說，這是一椿極不幸的事。</p>
<p>新疆的伊　塔城阿山三區，其境界經明定於中俄各次條約，均包括於中國疆域之內，而外界則與蘇聯毗連，蘇聯迄今亦承認此種倏約。近年以來中蘇邊界糾紛，及新疆內部民族的分裂運動，起自伊　塔城阿山三區，而新疆和蘇聯若干不愉快事件的發生，亦皆導源於此。維族領袖鮑爾漢，是一位開明的政治家，他和張治中將軍的見解相同，認　新疆問題的　結所在，所以新省府改組成立之日，一方面對伊犁塔阿三區謀和平，爭取三區首腦同進化合作，一方面對蘇友好，把外交部擱置已久的中蘇商約案，又重新恢復談商，並獲得蘇聯迪化總價事的友好支持。這完全說明和平友好解決新疆問題，團結新疆民族，中蘇兩國的見解，不僅是相同，並且一致需求的。我們極願中蘇商約談判的完全成功，更盼望新疆內部的僵局也早日打開，從而將新疆帶向光明的道路。</p>
<p>飽爾漢主席說得好：「加強對蘇貿易，繁榮地方經濟，來解決新疆人民生活問題；和怎樣加強團結，使和平統一早日實現」，是西北軍政長官和他的共同責任。此次張治中將軍遄返西北，其努力的方向當即在此。其次，「唯一的要務，是解除伊　塔阿三區的特殊化」。這位開明的政治家，對新疆問題的觀察是透闢的，他受命艱鉅和複雜的責任感，必將成爲新疆和平的鑰匙。它將從打開這條和平之路做起，化新疆爲安定，化新疆爲祥和。它爲祖國堅強西北門戶的努力，是何等令人可佩啊！</p>

<h3>李代總統勗免文武官員　（上接一版）</h3>
<p>誠然，在十餘年的戰爭當中，由於通貨膨脹，物價騰貴，若干公務人員是在過着極艱苦的生活，爲國家出死入生的將士，衣食都不能達到最低限度的要求，然而他們還在苦苦撐持，這種貞艱卓絕的精神，是非常值得讚佩，我應當代表國家向他們致無上的敬意，但是另一方面，許多不肖的官吏，利用職權，假公濟私，貪污舞弊，用各種狡詐的手段，來奪取公家的民脂民膏，甚至造成了今天全國人民所痛罵的豪門巨富，而他們還是安富尊榮，毫無顧忌，還有些不肖的軍事長官，不顧部屬士兵的痛苦，自已過着驕奢淫逸的生活，他們個人一天的揮霍，超過士兵終年的費用，在生活上他們不能與士卒同甘苦，在精神上他們與士卒完全脫節，另外還有許多軍政主官，熊度傲慢，盛氣凌人，奴役部屬，欺壓人民，於是長官與僚屬，部隊長與士兵，人民與政府在感情上形成了對立，當然更談不到團結合作，這樣一來，不獨官常軍紀掃地殆盡，而且中華民族傳統的樸質淳厚的風尚，謙虛忍讓的美德，也爲之破壞無餘，我認爲這種情形如果不立卽改善，再讓他發展下去，後果眞會不堪設想，我身受人民與國家負託之重，實不勝其悲憤，痛心，惶恐和憂懽，因此，我不能不提示出來，希望大家知所警惕。</p>
<p>復次，我再要告訴諸位，政府之謀取和平與革新政治這兩項決策，雖然對象不同，可是兩者的目的則一，都是基於遵循人民意旨和解除人民痛苦這一個最高原則而來的，爲着配合政府這個最高原則，我們各級政府必須首先做到不擾民，不害民，要將前面我所提到的那些不良的情形加以糾正革除。我要告訴我們全體軍政人員，大家都要提高爲國家人民服務的精神，不能稍存絲毫有私自利自　自大的心理。須知民主國家的官吏，就是人民的公僕，如果我們不能克盡職責，格守紀律，那就是違反國家和人民的利益，就會爲人民所摒棄，應受法律的制裁。自今天以後，政府爲貫澈革新政治起見，決心嚴伸紀綱，肅淸一切貪污腐化份子，決不容許這些份子　跡在政府中任何部門，我希望各級監察機關儘量據實檢舉，各級司法機關認眞檢察裁制，各地人民依法控訴，同時為顧慮到「衣食足而後知榮辱」的道理，政府對於各叛軍政人員的待遇，也自當盡最大努力來設法改善，但是大家也必需體諒政府的困難，忍受艱苦的生活，因爲在人民生活沒有改善以前，我們爲人民服務的人員，當然不能獲得較好的享受。總之，今後我決心以最大的熱誠，督促各軍政主官來整肅官常和軍紀，我們全體軍政人員，務必在這個號召之下，本「昨死今生」的精神，切實做到。此後我們的政治是否能夠改革，我們的國家是否能夠復興，乃至全國人民之死生禍福，我們各人的功罪榮辱，均繫於今天我們這一轉念之間。今天我在此一再反復申述這個道理，也就是要警告我們全體軍政人員，不要再因循泄沓，錯過了這個新生的機會，我不特以此期望於諸位，我也願以此和諸位共勉（完）</p>

<h3>美參院研討大西洋公約　反對受參戰約束　兼經，人特別是范堡均堅持此點</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕民主共和兩黨決策領袖今日在參院中表示，不願於北大西洋公約中，負參戰之道德義務。此項條約爲西方國家防黎蘇聯進攻之堡壘，現正由美·加·法·英·比·荷·盧第國進行談判。參院外委會主席康納利及前主席共和黨議負范登堡，於共和黨參議員唐納爾提出此問題後，均曾發出警吿。唐氏曾引聯合社電，舉出國務卿艾契遜新近與挪威外長闌琪談話時提出之八點，內有一點稱，雖然祗有國會可以宣戰，美政府願承認一簽字國被攻擊，卽係全體被攻擊之原則。此言可解釋爲願意參戰之道德的義務。唐氏對此提出抗議。康納利則稱，不贊成此項條約中有全美國在道德上負作戰義務之任何文字。余典范登堡曾向國務卿說明參院外委會不贊成在國際協定中列入任何文字，使美國於歐洲國家被攻擊時負有參戰義務。任何歐洲國家均可被另一國家攻擊，不僅爲吾人時常聽到之一國。康氏此語，顯係指蘇聯而言。范登堡稱，余望盟約中爲國會保留決定對武裝攻繫應取何種行動之全權，卽使美國不作任何軍事行動之保體，此約亦可具有效力。余意祗須承認美國對於武裝攻擊大西洋國家之關切，不必在條約中另加一字，已足無限期保證防止第三次世界大戰。余相信以前如有此稱關切之表示，兩次世界大戰卽可不致發生。</p>
<h3>瑞典盼能獲美援　有毅然放棄傳統中立意響　認北歐聯盟最為適應現狀</h3>
<p>〔聯合社瑞典京城十四日電〕瑞典國防當局宣稱，瑞典深慮東西兩方最後不免一戰，故擬參加北大西洋條約，惟同時亦不願觸怒蘇聯。瑞典願將其軍備配合美國標凖，並願美助以物資，俾得製造軍備，大量接濟丹挪。</p>
<p>瑞典甚願與西方軍事專家籌劃聯防事宜，希望西方國家於斯坎的那維亞半島被攻時，立卽出兵相助。敵方如直接進攻斯坎的那維亞，瑞典力能抵抗數星期或數月之久。戰事如不發生於斯坎的那維亞，則瑞典不擬立卽參戰。惟瑞典思想現已大變，深知在第三次世界大戰中決難置身事外，故已毅然決然將一百卅五年來之中立地位予以放棄，前此提議與丹挪簽訂聯防條約事，現仍有意爲之。</p>

<h3>美親共女記者　因間諜嫌疑　在蘇境被捕</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十五日電〕塔斯社今日引莫斯科報載，美女記者安娜史屈朗已因間諜罪在蘇聯被捕，將在數日內驅逐出境。現在莫斯科之美記者共計八人，史女士卽其中之一。伊年六十四歲，原籍尼勃拉斯加州，一九二三年嫁予莫斯科人叔平，著有親蘇書籍多種。一九二一年因從事救濟工作，初次赴蘇，時爲「霍斯特國際雜誌」訪員，一九二五年担任北美報紙同盟駐蘇訪員，一九三〇年在莫斯科創辦英文「莫斯科新聞」，該報已於本月初停刊。史屈朗曾著有「中國的黎明」一書，於一九四八年出版，記述其在中共區城的見聞。</p>
<p>美認蘇此舉　係一種烟幕</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十五日廣播：美官方人士今稱，蘇聯將親共之名記者史屈朗夫人驅逐出境一舉，可能係一種烟幕，因史夫人如留美國，蘇聯當可更易獲其助力也。該人士並指出史夫人最近一次赴蘇之前，曾協助華萊士競選。</p>

<h3>吉田新內閣　今日可組成</h3>
<p>閣僚名單將請麥帥批准</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十五日電〕吉田首相之發言人十五日宣稱：新內閣將於十六日成立。此為日本戰後的第七屆內閣。吉田可望於本日下午完成其政府組織，但因民主黨之要求至少在內閣中佔有三席，暫時發生障礙。發言人稱：內閣大致將在本日晚間組成，但可能爲時已晚，不及送交麥帥總部批准，故正式成立將延至十六日。</p>

<h3>土耳其向英提出建議　締結地中海公約　英盼土希參加歐洲議會</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十四日電〕今日下午英外相貝文與土耳其外長沙達克在外交部會談時，曾涉及大西洋公約，歐洲議會及巴勒斯坦大局等。據倫敦土耳其負責方面表示，外間謠傳土政府贊同加入大西洋公約，此說未可過於重視，現信此次會談乃因沙達克建議締結地中海公約，包括土希義法英在內，故沙氏乃與貝文作初步交換意見。聞貝文對於此舉，深表同情。關於歐洲議會事，現信貝文主張土耳其與希臘兩國亦派代表加入。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典十五日電〕據此間接華府訊，現任杜魯門特別軍事顧問之艾帥，將於三月中旬來希訪問勾留半月。希官方認爲艾帥訪希，殊無可能，但否認外傳艾帥來希訪問期間，可能與希簽訂一項地中海公約，同一方面力稱，此項公約現尙渺茫。</p>

<h3>Answering Inquiries Regarding the Prospects for Peace: Acting President Li Expresses Optimism; Supervisory Committee Members Hope the Executive Yuan Will Move Back to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Acting President Li is extremely optimistic about the prospects for peace. When asked by our newspaper's reporter on the evening of the 15th whether he was confident about the prospects for peace, he smiled and said, "I am confident, I am confident." However, due to time constraints, he did not fully reveal the reasons for his confidence. Acting President Li arrived at the Central Broadcasting Station at 9:00 PM on the 15th to make his first broadcast to the military and civilians of the country since taking office. He met with our newspaper's reporter a few minutes before, and only made a very brief conversation. When asked about his views on the peace issue, Acting President Li said: This matter requires our efforts. Regarding the CCP's repeated delays, Acting President Li did not seem to pay much attention to it, but said: "You can see," expressing his confidence fully when he said this. According to Acting President Li, he has not yet received reports from Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, and others who have arrived in Beiping. Acting President Li's broadcast began at exactly 9:00 PM in the afternoon and lasted for eleven minutes. Acting President Li used a slow Guangxi Mandarin to encourage the military and civilians of the country. After finishing his speech, he hurriedly got into the car and returned to his official residence.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Acting President Li hosted a banquet for President Yu of the Supervisory Yuan, Vice President Liu, and all the Supervisory Committee members in Nanjing at the Presidential Palace at 6:00 PM on the evening of the 15th, with more than fifty people attending. At 7:30 PM, he hosted another banquet at his official residence for Commander-in-Chief of the Capital Garrison Zhang Yinming, Mayor of Nanjing Teng Jie, and Leng Xin, among others.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] The Supervisory Committee members in Nanjing decided in the morning session of the Yuan on the 15th to hold a secret discussion meeting in the afternoon to exchange views on the current situation. More than forty Supervisory Committee members attended, still chaired by Yu Youren. The discussion focused on the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou and President Sun's personal issues. Regarding the irregularities in the procedures for the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou, the Supervisory Yuan has already submitted a censure case, which has not yet been answered. It has now been decided to urge the Executive Yuan to respond again in order to determine the second step. Regarding President Sun's personal matters, the committee members heard many rumors from outside, such as President Sun selling his official residence in the mausoleum and a certain woman selling houses in Shanghai, as well as Sun donating 40,000 US dollars to Zhongshan University in Guangzhou. They all agreed to investigate. If these things are true, the Supervisory Yuan should express its opinion. If they are not true, the Supervisory Yuan can also issue a statement to clarify the rumors, which will also help President Sun's personal reputation. It was then decided to authorize President Yu to appoint committee members to conduct the investigation. The meeting also discussed the location of the Legislative Yuan's meeting and the issue of the Executive Yuan's return to Nanjing. In general, it was hoped that the Executive Yuan could move back, and the committee members decided to make private efforts to promote the Legislative Yuan's resumption of meetings in Nanjing and the Executive Yuan's return to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Widespread Rumors of President Sun's Resignation; He Once Entrusted President Yu with a Letter to Bring to Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] It is widely rumored in the capital on the 15th that President Sun Ke has submitted his resignation to Acting President Li due to high blood pressure. Acting President Li has already sent a telegram to persuade him to stay. Reporters inquired with relevant parties on the evening of the 15th, who said that there was no such thing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 15th Dispatch] Executive Yuan President Sun Ke convened a symposium of legislators in Guangzhou at 4:00 PM on the 15th. The content was kept strictly confidential and could not be ascertained.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] President Yu Youren of the Control Yuan said that he returned to Nanjing from Guangzhou, carrying a letter from Executive Yuan President Sun Ke, requesting Acting President Li to allow him to rest due to health reasons.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Reliable sources said on the 15th that Executive Yuan President Sun Ke submitted his resignation because Acting President Li gained more support in his efforts to seek a political solution with the CCP, making the hope for peace in China, which was torn apart by the war, gradually increase. Some legislators and other government officials believe that Sun's insistence on moving the Executive Yuan to Guangzhou is an "obstacle to peace." Most legislators demanded that the Legislative Yuan reconvene in Nanjing, and the Control Yuan held a monthly meeting in Nanjing today, which was a serious blow to Sun's position. When Li Zongren took office as Acting President, he faced the non-cooperation of extremists, but he has now gradually gained support within the government. General He Yingqin's arrival in Nanjing has given Acting President Li more power to control the army so as not to take actions that may be contrary to his peace policy, especially the National Army in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, because General Tang Enbo is an old subordinate of He.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Hong Kong, 15th Dispatch] According to Guangzhou news, Acting President Li may ask General He Yingqin to succeed as President of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Rectifying Official Conduct and Military Discipline: Acting President Li Encourages Civilian and Military Officials to Reform Politics and Relieve the People's Suffering</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Acting President Li broadcasted to civilian and military personnel, educators, and frontline soldiers at the Central Broadcasting Station at 9:00 PM on the evening of the 15th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>All levels of civil servants and officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force of the country:</p>
<p>Since the day I took charge, considering that the arduous historical task entrusted to me is very important, I feel apprehensive and uneasy at all times. I must do my best to live up to the expectations of the country and the people. For the sake of the country's difficulties and the people's suffering, I have decided that in the shortest possible time, our government must complete two important tasks urgently required by the people of the country: First, to seek peace, and second, to reform politics. Regarding the former, I have explained it in several statements. Today, what I want to talk to you about is the issue of political reform. At the same time, I want to tell you that the government has now decided to work hard in this direction and will overcome all difficulties and eliminate all obstacles to achieve the goal. The issue of political reform, of course, includes a wide range of things, but I believe that the most important and minimal thing at present is to rectify official conduct and military discipline. In other words, we must first start with the psychological and behavioral reform of military and political personnel throughout the country, because without sound workers, there is no way to establish a good political atmosphere. The ancients said, "If one is upright, one can lead without giving orders; if one is not upright, one's orders will not be followed," which is the same principle. Regarding these words, I believe that not only your superiors have already said it to you, but at the same time, I also believe that you must have all felt it together. However, from today onwards, we will not only talk about it, but more importantly, everyone must earnestly practice it.</p>
<p>Now our country is so dilapidated and our people are suffering so unbearably. Not only is national construction impossible, but even the line of hope for national revival after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War has been on the verge of extinction. Not only is it impossible to increase the people's happiness, but even the minimum standard of living cannot be maintained. What is the reason for this? Of course, we do not deny that this is the result of years of war against foreign and domestic enemies, but it is an undeniable fact that we who serve the country and the people have not been able to fulfill our duties. Moreover, even further, there are still a few people who are disturbing the people, exploiting the people, and increasing the people's suffering. I ask everyone, we receive the country's salary and the people's support, but we cannot relieve the people's suffering and increase their welfare. Instead, we have the heart to neglect our duties and seek personal gain. How can we face the country and the people, and how can we face our own conscience? Many people criticize our government for being corrupt and incompetent. I think this is not "groundless accusation" and there is no need to "avoid treatment." We can only frankly admit past mistakes, review past shortcomings, and take out courage and determination to start anew from the bottom up in order to save the country from disaster, relieve the people's suffering, and then build the country and benefit the people.

<h3>Nanjing City Council Resolves to Telegraph President Sun to Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>And Requests the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans to Reconvene in Nanjing</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] The Nanjing City Council resolved on the 14th to telegraph Executive Yuan President Sun and the heads of various ministries and commissions to return to Nanjing to preside over official affairs, and also telegraphed Presidents Yu and Tong of the two Yuans and all members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, urging the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans to reconvene in Nanjing as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Li Hanhun Arrives in Nanjing</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] The newly appointed Administrative Governor of Hainan and Chairman of the Hainan Provincial Preparatory Committee, Li Hanhun, flew from Wuhan to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 15th.

<h3>The CCP Makes a Simple Report of the News of Yan Huiqing and Others Arriving in Beiping - Without Adding the Title of Peace Representatives to Yan and Others</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 15th Broadcast: "World News Service" reported: The peace delegation, Yan Huiqing and others, have safely flown from Qingdao to Beiping. The CCP radio station only reported it with very simple words on the 15th, and did not add the title of peace representatives to Yan and others, only saying: "Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, Zhang Shizhao, Jiang Yong, Huang Qihan, together with the pilot and others, flew to Beiping at 5:00 PM on the 14th. Yan and others flew from Shanghai to Qingdao on the 13th and transferred to Beiping on the 14th."</p>
<h3>Taiyuan's Grain Problem is Serious; Yan Xishan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Flew to Nanjing in the Afternoon on the Same Plane; He Reported to the Acting President That Evening</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] General Yan Xishan arrived in Shanghai by special plane at 8:00 AM on the 15th. This was Yan's first visit to the city in fifteen years. It was kept strictly confidential beforehand, and very few people knew about it. After arriving, he immediately drove to visit Mr. Lai Puhan, but because Lai was scheduled to leave for the United States on the 16th and was busy with miscellaneous affairs, he did not go to the office, so Yan only met with Griffin, the Deputy Director of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, and Mick Jong Grant, the Special Assistant to the Director of the Commission, to discuss the Taiyuan airlift problem. In the past, Taiyuan was not within the scope of US aid for food supply, and Qingdao is facing a shortage of gasoline, so it will be very difficult to continue airlifting supplies to Taiyuan in the future. All of these were the main topics of Yan's trip to Shanghai for consultations. At noon yesterday, the Shanxi fellow villagers in Shanghai held a public banquet for Yan to express their respect. At 3:30 PM in the afternoon, Yan took the same plane to Nanjing to visit Acting President Li.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Director Yan Xishan of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, due to the serious grain problem in Taiyuan, must personally ask the central government for a solution. He flew from Taiyuan to Qingdao on the 14th, and flew from Shanghai to Nanjing at 5:30 PM on the afternoon of the 15th. The special plane landed at the Ming Palace Airport. Dozens of people, including He Yingqin, Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Gui Yongqing, Guo Chan, Qin Dechun, and Sun Chu, went to the airport to welcome him. Acting President Li also sent Li Yuqing, the adjutant of the Presidential Palace, to represent him at the airport. After Yan got off the plane, he shook hands with all the welcomers one by one, and briefly exchanged greetings with He Yingqin and Xu Yongchang at the airport. He then drove to the Shanxi Provincial Government Office in Shangcheng'an to talk to Guo Zongfen in Beiping. At 7:30 PM in the evening, He Yingqin, Xu Yongchang, and Gu Zhutong jointly hosted a banquet for General Yan at He's private residence in Douya Gate, and invited Sun Chu and Yang Aiyuan, the Deputy Directors of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters who arrived in Nanjing a day earlier, as well as Gui Yongqing and Guo Chan, to accompany them. At 9:30 PM in the evening, Yan paid respects to Acting President Li to report on the serious grain problem in Taiyuan and the recent military and political situation in the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters area. They talked until 11:00 PM before he left. He then visited Gu Zhutong at 11:00 PM and returned to his residence at 12:00 PM. Yan will stay in Nanjing for two or three days and then return to Taiyuan. Acting President Li is scheduled to host a banquet for Yan at noon on the 16th.</p>
<p>According to people who came with Yan, Yan came this time because the grain problem in Taiyuan is serious, and he specifically asked the central government for a concrete and quick solution. The grain in Taiyuan relies on the central government's airlift. The grain needed has already been stored by the government in Shanghai and Qingdao, but due to the lack of gasoline, the amount of airlift is very limited. Currently, the grain reserves in Taiyuan are only enough for three to five days, and the grain transport planes are in danger of being suspended due to the gasoline problem. Yan had sent Sun Chu to Beijing on the 14th to ask for a solution. After Sun left Taiyuan, news came from the airlift that the grain transport planes flying from Qingdao to Taiyuan might be suspended from the 15th. Yan then temporarily decided to take a grain transport plane to Qingdao, and then flew from Qingdao to Shanghai. On the 15th, he met with Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang of the Combined Logistics Headquarters, Finance Minister Xu Kan, Griffin, the Deputy Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch, and others to discuss the issue of airlifting grain to Taiyuan and allocating funds to purchase gasoline, and some results have been obtained.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 15th Dispatch] The airlift to Taiyuan was suspended from the 11th due to the lack of gasoline. The Jin Provincial personnel stationed in Qingdao have been actively negotiating every day, and it is said that they can borrow gasoline from the Qingdao Air Force.

<h3>Using Silver Dollars is Groundless; Xu Kan Convened a Meeting of Shanghai Financial Leaders Yesterday to Exchange Opinions on New Economic Plans</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Finance Minister Xu Kan arrived in Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 14th. On the morning of the 15th, he visited Mr. Lai Puhan, the President of the Central Bank, who is about to leave for the United States, to discuss US aid matters. Xu also convened a meeting of the leaders of the financial community in the city at 11:00 AM in the morning. It is said that Xu's main mission this time is twofold: one is to study and expand the promotion of short-term gold public prices and complete the organization of the Fund Custody Committee; the other is to exchange views with the local financial community on the new economic plan that will be announced soon. Due to Finance Minister Xu's visit to Shanghai, it is widely rumored that the currency system will be reformed again and silver dollars will be used. However, when reporters inquired with the responsible persons of the National Bank's Issuing Bureau, they all said that they had not heard of it. According to their personal opinions, it is currently impossible to issue silver dollars. The so-called saying that the mint had started casting tin dollars a week ago is purely unfounded. In order to enhance the credibility of the currency, the authorities have been constantly selling materials and tightening credit. The flatness of prices in recent days shows the effect of this policy. It will continue to be implemented in the future. Other than this, no other measures have been considered.</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Discusses the Overall Situation: The Major Plan of Peace and War Depends on the Central Government; Taiyuan Will Not Be the Second Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] General Yan Xishan met with our newspaper's reporter at the Capital Hotel late at night on the 15th. According to him, he came to Beijing this time to ask the authorities about the food problem in Taiyuan. When he paid respects to Acting President Li on the evening of the 15th, the Acting President said that the Central Committee would do its best to supply it and continue airlifting supplies. The specific methods will be discussed with relevant agencies soon. When asked about his views on local peace and the eight conditions for peace talks proposed by the CCP, General Yan said that the major plan of peace and war depends on the central government, and he will abide by the will of the central government. When the reporter asked if Taiyuan would seek local peace, General Yan said in a firm tone that Taiyuan will never be the second Beiping. I am responsible for defending Taiyuan and will never abandon my responsibility. Yan further used the human body as a metaphor, saying that only the nerve center of a person can determine the activity of the whole body. If the one who issues orders is not the nerve center but one of the limbs, then this is abnormal and should not be the case. Yan bluntly pointed out that local peace is wrong. When the reporter asked about his views on Fu Zuoyi's local peace in Beiping, Yan avoided answering on the grounds that he did not understand the environment in Beiping. When asked if the eight conditions proposed by the CCP could make the peace talks successful, Yan smiled and said: The eight conditions proposed by the CCP are entirely conditions for the victor to deal with the defeated. It is difficult to achieve true peace negotiations from these eight conditions. Finally, Yan also said that everything in the world depends on human effort, and the future of the country is still promising. The President will still return to Beijing to discuss peace talks with Acting President Li. Sun especially said that important members of the Executive Yuan will go to Beijing after the deployment in Guangzhou, but he personally is not suitable to go due to high blood pressure. Next, Tong reported on the process of exchanging views with legislators staying in Guangzhou on the 7th of this month, and finally reported on the living standards in Guangzhou and the deployment of the Legislative Yuan in Guangzhou, saying that no matter where the resumption of meetings is located, whether in Beijing or in Guangzhou, our will must be consistent, we must be united, complete, and unified in order to lead future politics, otherwise it will become a division, and there will be nowhere to go for both peace and war. I hope all colleagues will seriously consider it. Then, the committee members spoke with enthusiasm, and the meeting adjourned at 4:30.</p>
<p>[Our City News] The Legislative Yuan will generally reconvene in Beijing on the 25th or 26th. Legislators from all over the country will begin to register on the 21st. President Tong Guanxian will return to Beijing in a day or two to prepare for the resumption of meetings.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty and the Xinjiang Issue</h3>
<p>Since the central government appointed Burhan as the chairman of Xinjiang Province and sent General Zhang Zhizhong back to the Northwest to negotiate the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty with the Soviet Dihua consul general, the gloomy atmosphere between China and the Soviet Union has gradually cleared. According to a United News Agency dispatch from Guangzhou, negotiations on the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty are still in the exploratory stage. However, according to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing, preliminary discussions between the Soviet Union and Xinjiang on the establishment of an economic agreement have been completed in Dihua, and have proceeded well. The content has not been disclosed. Reuters estimates that the content involves the Soviet Union's early demands to exploit Xinjiang's mineral resources, including rare metals used in steelmaking. If this estimate is correct, then the content of the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty may be the granting of mining rights in Xinjiang in exchange for certain economic benefits from the Soviet Union, thereby establishing friendly relations between Xinjiang and the Soviet Union, and further developing friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. Standing on the position of being kind to our neighbors and pursuing peace and friendship with foreign countries, we naturally express our satisfaction with the initial success of the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty negotiations.</p>
<p>China and the Soviet Union are two independent great powers on the continent. Regardless of geographical, historical, or economic relations, China and the Soviet Union should maintain a friendly relationship. The Sino-Soviet border adjacent to Outer Mongolia accounts for half of China's entire border line, starting from the Pamirs in the west, passing through the Altai Mountains, the Mongolian desert, and the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers in the north, and extending to the mouth of the Tumen River in the east. These are all adjacent areas between China and the Soviet Union, and also the areas with the most border disputes. The disputes over the past century have arisen either because the border has not been determined, or because although the border has been determined, the boundary markers are insufficient, or because of different interpretations of treaty wording, or because the Japanese puppets and the Soviets and Mongols have changed the border, which China does not recognize vis-à-vis the Soviets and Mongols. It is not surprising that neighboring countries in an international society easily have border disputes. What is regrettable is that Sino-Soviet-Mongolian border disputes are often an expanded explanation of political disputes, leading to unnecessary conflicts and frictions between the two countries in diplomacy and economics. From a national standpoint, this is extremely unfortunate.</p>
<p>The three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan in Xinjiang, whose borders were clearly defined in various Sino-Russian treaties, are all included within China's territory, while the outside world is adjacent to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union still recognizes these treaties. In recent years, Sino-Soviet border disputes and internal ethnic separatist movements in Xinjiang have originated in the three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan, and the occurrence of some unpleasant incidents between Xinjiang and the Soviet Union also stem from this. Uyghur leader Burhan is an enlightened politician. He shares the same views as General Zhang Zhizhong, believing that the crux of the Xinjiang issue lies in peacefully resolving the three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan, striving for cooperation with the leaders of the three districts for co-evolution, and being friendly to the Soviet Union. The Sino-Soviet commercial treaty case, which had been shelved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a long time, has been resumed and negotiated, and has gained the friendly support of the Soviet consul general in Dihua. This fully demonstrates that the views of China and the Soviet Union on peacefully resolving the Xinjiang issue, uniting the Xinjiang ethnic groups, are not only the same but also mutually desired. We sincerely hope for the complete success of the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty negotiations, and we also hope that the internal stalemate in Xinjiang will be broken as soon as possible, thereby leading Xinjiang towards a bright future.</p>
<p>Chairman Burhan said well: "Strengthening trade with the Soviet Union and promoting local economic prosperity to solve the livelihood problems of the people of Xinjiang; and how to strengthen unity and realize peaceful unification as soon as possible" is the common responsibility of the military and political leaders of the Northwest and him. General Zhang Zhizhong's swift return to the Northwest this time is aimed at this effort. Secondly, "the only important task is to eliminate the special status of the three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan." This enlightened politician's observation of the Xinjiang issue is insightful, and his sense of heavy and complex responsibility will become the key to peace in Xinjiang. He will start by opening up this path of peace, transforming Xinjiang into stability and harmony. His efforts to strengthen the Northwest gateway of the motherland are truly admirable!</p>

<h3>Acting President Li's Encouragement and Dismissal of Civil and Military Officials (Continued from page 1)</h3>
<p>Indeed, in the past decade or so of war, due to inflation and soaring prices, some civil servants have been living a very hard life, and the soldiers who risked their lives for the country cannot even meet the minimum requirements for food and clothing. Yet, they are still persevering. This spirit of perseverance and fortitude is truly admirable. I should represent the nation in expressing my utmost respect to them. However, on the other hand, many unscrupulous officials have abused their power for personal gain, engaging in corruption and malfeasance, and using all sorts of cunning means to seize the people's wealth for their own benefit, even creating the wealthy and powerful families that the people of the whole country are denouncing today. Yet, they are still living in luxury and extravagance, without any scruples. Furthermore, there are some unscrupulous military officers who disregard the suffering of their subordinates and soldiers, indulging in a life of extravagance and dissipation. Their personal extravagance in a single day exceeds the annual expenses of a soldier. In terms of living conditions, they cannot share the joys and hardships of their soldiers, and in terms of spirit, they are completely detached from their soldiers. In addition, there are many military and political leaders who are arrogant, domineering, enslaving their subordinates, and oppressing the people. As a result, a sense of opposition has formed between superiors and subordinates, between military leaders and soldiers, and between the people and the government. There is certainly no talk of unity and cooperation. As a result, not only have official norms and military discipline been completely destroyed, but also the traditional simplicity and honesty, and the virtues of humility and tolerance of the Chinese nation have been completely ruined. I believe that if this situation is not immediately improved and allowed to continue to develop, the consequences will be unimaginable. I am deeply entrusted by the people and the nation, and I am truly overwhelmed with sorrow, anger, heartache, fear, and anxiety. Therefore, I cannot but point it out, hoping that everyone will be aware of the danger.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I want to tell you again that the government's two decisions to seek peace and reform politics, although the objects are different, the purpose of both is the same. Both are based on the supreme principle of following the will of the people and relieving the suffering of the people. In order to cooperate with the government's supreme principle, our governments at all levels must first and foremost refrain from disturbing or harming the people, and correct and eliminate the bad situations I mentioned earlier. I want to tell all our military and political personnel that everyone must enhance the spirit of serving the country and the people, and must not harbor even the slightest bit of selfishness, self-interest, or arrogance. It must be understood that officials in a democratic country are the servants of the people. If we cannot fulfill our duties and abide by discipline, then we are violating the interests of the country and the people, and we will be rejected by the people and subject to the sanctions of the law. From today onwards, in order to implement political reform, the government is determined to strictly enforce discipline and eliminate all corrupt elements, and will never allow these elements to leave traces in any department of the government. I hope that the supervisory organs at all levels will report the facts as much as possible, the judicial organs at all levels will conduct serious inspections and adjudications, and the people of all localities will file lawsuits in accordance with the law. At the same time, considering the principle of "knowing honor and disgrace after having enough food and clothing," the government will also do its best to improve the treatment of military and political personnel. However, everyone must also understand the difficulties of the government and endure a difficult life, because before the lives of the people are improved, the personnel who serve the people cannot, of course, enjoy better treatment. In short, from now on, I am determined to urge the military and political leaders to rectify official norms and military discipline with the greatest enthusiasm. All our military and political personnel must, under this call, do our best to achieve the spirit of "yesterday's death, today's life." Whether our politics can be reformed, whether our country can be revived, and even the life and death, good fortune and misfortune of the people of the whole country, and the merits, faults, honor and disgrace of each of us, all depend on this turning point today. Today, I repeatedly reiterate this principle here, which is to warn all our military and political personnel not to delay and miss this new opportunity. I not only expect this from you, but I also want to encourage you together (End).</p>

<h3>US Senate Discusses Atlantic Pact, Opposes Being Bound by Participation in War, Especially Vandenberg Insists on This Point</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 14th] Leading figures of both the Democratic and Republican parties expressed in the Senate today their unwillingness to bear the moral obligation to participate in war in the North Atlantic Pact. This treaty, a bulwark for Western countries against a Soviet attack, is currently being negotiated by the US, Canada, France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and former chairman Republican Senator Vandenberg, both issued warnings after Republican Senator Donnell raised the issue. Donnell cited a United Press International dispatch, listing the eight points recently raised by Secretary of State Acheson in his talks with Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, one of which stated that although only Congress can declare war, the US government is willing to acknowledge that an attack on one signatory country is an attack on all. This statement can be interpreted as a willingness to assume a moral obligation to participate in the war. Donnell protested this. Connally said he did not approve of any wording in the treaty that would place America under a moral obligation to fight. Vandenberg said he had explained to the Secretary of State that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee did not approve of including any wording in international agreements that would obligate the United States to participate in the war if European countries were attacked. Any European country could be attacked by another country, not just the one we often hear about. Connally's words clearly referred to the Soviet Union. Vandenberg said, "I hope the alliance will reserve for Congress the full power to decide what action to take in response to an armed attack. Even without any guarantee of military action by the United States, this agreement can be effective. I believe that it is enough to indefinitely guarantee the prevention of a third world war if we only acknowledge America's concern about armed attacks on Atlantic countries, without adding another word to the treaty. I believe that if such a statement of concern had been made earlier, the two world wars would not have occurred."</p>
<h3>Sweden Hopes to Obtain US Aid, Has the Resolution to Abandon Traditional Neutrality, Believes a Nordic Alliance Is Most Suitable for the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Stockholm, 14th] Swedish defense authorities declared that Sweden is deeply concerned that a final war between the East and West is inevitable, and therefore intends to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty, but at the same time does not want to anger the Soviet Union. Sweden is willing to coordinate its military equipment with US standards, and is willing for the US to assist with materials to manufacture military equipment and provide large-scale assistance to Denmark and Norway.</p>
<p>Sweden is very willing to plan joint defense matters with Western military experts, hoping that Western countries will immediately send troops to assist when the Scandinavian peninsula is attacked. If the enemy directly attacks Scandinavia, Sweden is capable of resisting for several weeks or months. If the war does not occur in Scandinavia, then Sweden does not intend to immediately participate in the war. However, Sweden's thinking has now greatly changed, and it deeply knows that it is difficult to stay out of the third world war, so it has resolutely decided to abandon its 135 years of neutrality. The previous proposal to sign a joint defense treaty with Denmark and Norway is still intended to be done.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange met with a reporter from the Daily Telegraph today and denied rumors that the opportunity for Norway to join the Atlantic Pact had been reduced after his visit to Washington.</p>
<h3>Wallace is Too Clever, Modifies Truman's Budget</h3>
<p>Mainly reduces military expenditures for social undertakings</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] Wallace told the press today that "half of Truman's budget is used to maintain the 'Cold War,' and less than one-seventh is used to eliminate disease, unrest, poverty, and illiteracy." Wallace vehemently criticized Truman's budget and policies at a reception for reporters today, and proposed his own "progressive budget," totaling $54 billion, of which military expenditures would be $6 billion, rather than Truman's $14 billion. Wallace said that Truman's "New Deal" was an illusion, and believed that the door to peace had been opened by Stalin's three proposals for talks in the past two years. He also criticized Truman's attempt to "circumvent" the US domestic economic crisis through large-scale military expansion plans. He also said that the European Recovery Program was part of the "Cold War." In addition, Wallace endorsed the policy of increasing taxes on industrial profits and the President's technical assistance program for underdeveloped areas.</p>
<h3>Pro-Communist Female Journalist Arrested in Soviet Territory on Suspicion of Espionage</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 15th] TASS reported today, citing a Moscow newspaper, that beautiful journalist Anna Louise Strong has been arrested in the Soviet Union for espionage and will be deported within a few days. There are currently eight US journalists in Moscow, and Strong is one of them. She is 64 years old, originally from Nebraska, and married Moscow native Joel Shubin in 1923. She has authored many pro-Soviet books. She first went to the Soviet Union in 1921 to engage in relief work, and was a correspondent for "Hearst International Magazine" at the time. In 1925, she served as a correspondent for the North American Newspaper Alliance in the Soviet Union. In 1930, she founded the English-language "Moscow News" in Moscow, which was discontinued earlier this month. Strong authored the book "Dawn Out of China," published in 1948, which recorded her experiences in the Chinese Communist areas.</p>
<p>US Believes Soviet Move is a Smokescreen</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Washington, 15th Broadcast: US officials said today that the Soviet Union's deportation of pro-Communist journalist Anna Louise Strong may be a smokescreen, because the Soviet Union could more easily obtain her assistance if Ms. Strong remained in the United States. The official also pointed out that Ms. Strong had assisted Wallace in his campaign before her most recent visit to the Soviet Union.</p>

According to a Tokyo dispatch, MacArthur, in light of the victory of the Chinese Communist Party, had submitted a secret report on the military situation in Japan to the United States during Royal's visit to Tokyo, and requested additional troops and aircraft.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] The Department of the Army announced on the 14th that Secretary of the Army Royal will hold a press conference on the afternoon of the 16th.

<p>[United Press International, San Francisco, 14th] Secretary of the Army Royal, who returned home from inspecting defenses in the Far East, reiterated at a press conference and Democratic Party dinner today that the United States has no plans to withdraw from Japan, and in fact intends to rebuild Japan, so the people of Australia and the Philippines can rest assured. However, Royal also said that it is not known how long the United States will remain in Japan, and this will depend on future circumstances. A reporter asked if the United States attaches importance to Europe and neglects the Pacific side of defense, as was the case during World War II, what is the truth? Royal replied, "I don't know about the 'Europe First' military strategy. I said this because the US military is currently most heavily burdened in Europe." Royal also said that the occupied countries are completing their new goals in Germany and Japan.</p>

The spokesman said that the cabinet will probably be formed this evening, but it may be too late to submit it to MacArthur's headquarters for approval, so the formal establishment will be delayed until the 16th.</p>

<h3>Train Interrupted Again for Five Hours Yesterday, Employees on Two Lines Request Three Items, Director Wang Agrees to Issue 5,000 Yuan to Each Person First</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Employees of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration, dissatisfied with the new method of individual treatment adjustment announced by the Bureau the day before yesterday, staged a labor strike again yesterday.

Staff from all units gathered in the open space on the left side of the Bureau. Union leaders went to persuade them, and the opinions of the masses varied. The three points that can be summarized are: (1) The minimum salary for workers should be equal to the value of three stones of rice. (2) A loan of 20,000 yuan per person. (3) Employee treatment should not be lower than that of the Telecommunications Bureau and the Postal Bureau. He Guanglong, director of the Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and Zhang Taixiang, director of the Political Work Department, arrived one after another after hearing the news. Director He also reported the cause of the labor strike to Commander Chen Daqing by telephone.

Director He announced this opinion to the public, and after further efforts by the union leaders, Director Wang agreed to issue 5,000 yuan to each person starting today, and the calculation of treatment will be based on the Telecommunications Bureau. He also ordered each unit to elect one representative to investigate the method of calculating salaries for the employees of the Telecommunications Bureau together with the Telecommunications Bureau.

(4) Horse fodder for each troop unit cannot be supplied by the localities due to the low output. The Supply Bureau is requested to purchase the goods and supply them to each troop unit.

<h3>Mo Dehui in Taiwan - Cries to Reporters - Remittance of 20 Million Yuan is a Fact - But No Handgun Threat</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Taipei, 15th] Mr. Mo Dehui, this afternoon, at the National Taiwan University Hospital, said he had invited Mr. Liu Zhe to the scene to transfer the funds for distribution under his name, but due to time constraints, he was unable to invite representatives from the seven groups to witness the event together, and admitted that his handling was somewhat negligent. When reporters continued to inquire about the details, Mr. Mo repeatedly said that the inside story was too complicated. He also mentioned that when he was in the hospital, he was surrounded by more than 3,000 refugees from Northeast China for five days and nights, which was truly heartbreaking. He then burst into tears, his face covered in tears, and cried that the refugees from Northeast China were too pitiful, and few were willing to take responsibility for the relief effort, resulting in the remaining materials not being properly handled. As the reporters were leaving, Mr. Mo was still weeping.</p>
<h3>Police Officially Deny - The Rumor of Mo Dehui's Kidnapping - Feng Yun Issues Statement Regarding 20 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Police Bureau issued the following written statement regarding the external rumor of Mo Dehui's kidnapping: "Having read the newspaper report of Vice President Liu Jingyu's statement in Nanjing regarding the distribution of the Northeast Relief Fund, the section stating '...imprisoned by soldiers and bandits in the Chief Inspector's office...' does not correspond with the facts. Mr. Mo Dehui's arrival at the Chief Inspector's office was of his own accord, accompanied by Dalian Mayor Zhao Ximeng, National Assembly Representative Zhao Quanbi, and more than ten other gentlemen. Therefore, the rumor of kidnapping is entirely false. Furthermore, Mr. Mo, on the day after his arrival in Taiwan, sent a telegram to Liu Gongyun of the Central Bank, instructing him to forward it to Zhang Weiren, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and to Bureau Chief Yu Shuping, thanking them for their care in Shanghai, stating: 'President Liu, please instruct that it be sent to Director Zhang Weiren of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and to Bureau Chief Yu Shuping, thanking them deeply for their care in Shanghai. I arrived safely in Taiwan yesterday afternoon. Sincerely, February 10th.' (Also, the previous day's report incorrectly stated that the Huangpu Police Bureau Chief Inspector's office was the Municipal Police Bureau)."</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of coercing 20 million yuan, according to Feng Yun, a member of the Liaoning Provincial Assembly, 'He represented the Northeast Transportation Bureau, 300 soldiers of the 52nd Army, 75 displaced students in Shanghai (excluding those from existing schools), the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters Engineer Command (25 people), the Central Training Corps (60 people), the Second Traffic Police Bureau, and the Northeast Press, totaling seven groups. At that time, Mo Dehui and Zhao Ximeng personally wrote a note, which was taken to the Central Bank to transfer the funds to him for distribution on behalf of the groups.'"</p>

<h3>Many Bank Clients Have Checks Bounce; Financial Management Bureau Intensifies Inspections</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Financial Management Bureau is paying close attention to the situation of bounced checks from bank clients. It has dispatched a large number of auditors to various banks to investigate the reasons for the bounced checks.</p>
<p>According to the Financial Management Bureau, there are two reasons for the increase in bounced checks: (1) Clients have overdrawn beyond their overdraft limit, resulting in insufficient funds; (2) Banks are facing a tight financial situation themselves, and are temporarily unable to turn funds around. Regardless of the reason, bounced checks are an undesirable phenomenon. In order to determine responsibility, the Bureau has decided to send personnel to various banks to inspect the accounts of general clients and the business situation of the banks themselves. If any illegal business operations are discovered, penalties will be imposed.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Certificates Fall Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the opening price of foreign exchange transfer certificates reflected a strong desire to sell short, hovering around 1,250 yuan. Subsequently, due to a sudden and sharp tightening of interbank lending, importers and exporters rushed to unload their holdings, and the market price fell back to 1,200 yuan. In the afternoon, the Central Bank intervened and purchased 200,000 US dollars, improving market conditions. The afternoon closing price for commercial designated banks was 1,240 yuan for buying and 1,280 yuan for selling, a decrease of 20 yuan compared to yesterday.</p>
<h3>Influx of Idle Funds from South China; Credit Conditions Ease from Tight</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday morning, due to unusually tight credit conditions, with the daily interest rate reaching as high as 20 yuan per 1,000 yuan, market prices generally declined. However, credit conditions eased in the afternoon, and commodity prices rose sharply. According to analysis by senior officials of the National Bank, the easing of credit conditions was mainly due to the influx of idle funds from South China. Currently, commodity prices in Guangdong are much higher than in Shanghai, leading to a reverse flow of funds.</p>
<p>Previously, the exchange rate from Guangzhou to Shanghai was 750 yuan to 1,000 yuan. The day before yesterday, it had increased to 1,000 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and yesterday it further increased to 1,100 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Due to the influx of idle funds, the daily interest rate has returned to 80 yuan per 1,000 yuan. It is predicted that there will be no major changes in market conditions today.</p>
<h3>Rediscount Committee Approves 20 Loan Applications</h3>

<h3>Continued Sale of Raw Silk; Over 700 Bundles Sold</h3>
<p>In order to curb rising prices, the government has prepared a large quantity of goods for sale. One of these items is raw silk, of which there are more than 1,000 bundles. The sale of this silk is entrusted by the China Trust Bureau to the China Silk Corporation. As of the 14th, the China Trust Bureau had sold 735 bundles. The market has already absorbed a large quantity, and there were no buyers at the close of the market. There were also no purchases yesterday. As a result, silk prices fell back and stabilized. Over 600 million Gold Yuan were recovered. The Bureau will continue to sell the silk depending on market conditions.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Inexorably Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was affected by tight credit conditions and high daily interest rates of up to 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan, resulting in a flat and weak trend. Although there was a rebound in the afternoon, general prices remained low. For example, "four and a half" sugar was 17,500 yuan, "three and a half" sugar was 15,500 yuan, and coarse sugar was 17,500 yuan. Various grades of refined white and red sugar all experienced slight declines of 200 to 500 yuan. However, the prices of Zhen Ji's sliced crystal sugar, clear ice sugar, and green sugar remained the same as yesterday's market, as sellers were unwilling to lower prices.</p>
<h3>Decline in Silk Fabrics Not Yet Halted</h3>
<p>The opening trend for superior grade raw silk yesterday morning was flat and weak. Later, the selling pressure intensified due to tight credit conditions, and prices continued to decline. The afternoon closing price was 410,000 yuan for 35 bundles, a decrease of 230,000 yuan from the previous day. Jingli dried silk also fell by 230,000 yuan. There was little interest in other varieties, and foreign export firms remained on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Rayon: The opening price for immediate delivery of Tianqiao rayon was 370,000 yuan. Due to credit conditions, all parties were watching and there were few transactions. Prices remained sluggish. The afternoon closing price for immediate delivery remained at 370,000 yuan, and the price for forward delivery was 410,000 yuan, a decrease of approximately 30,000 yuan from the previous day. Arbitrage increased to 9 jiao to 1 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk fabrics: The opening price for Huaqiang coverlets was 247,000 yuan, rising to 253,000 yuan at one point and falling to 246,000 yuan at the lowest. The afternoon closing price rebounded slightly to 250,000 yuan. The opening price for rayon coverlets was 170,000 yuan, and the afternoon closing price rose to 172,000 yuan. Bique crepe opened at 8,860 yuan and closed at 8,700 yuan, a decrease of approximately 10%. Arbitrage increased to 9 jiao to 1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions Sparse</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market conditions were such that, due to dwindling inventories and constantly increasing costs, sellers were determined to hold out for higher prices, and the trend continued to be upward. However, transactions were sparse due to unsuccessful negotiations. It is understood that since the Lunar New Year, the Suzhou and Wuxi areas have been considering adding additional taxes to various varieties, but under the aforementioned circumstances, it is impossible to proceed.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Prices Hover</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tung oil market, after opening, experienced a sudden halt to rising prices due to tight positions among industry players and high interbank interest rates. The underlying trend gradually showed signs of instability. However, when this month's preliminary index was released, showing an increase of slightly less than four times compared to the previous period, sellers regained confidence due to the sharp increase in expenses, and the willingness to sell turned slightly firmer. The trend quickly turned upward, and the final result was that prices remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices Mixed; Tight Credit Conditions Hamper Efforts to Boost Fabric Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton yarn prices fluctuated. The opening reflected the weakness from the previous day, and buying interest was lackluster. During the day, various groups saw no buying or selling, and only a few individual investors made slight upward adjustments. Near noon, it was heard that the cost of living index had increased significantly compared to the previous period, and there were rumors of currency reform. As a result, confidence was restored and the weak situation was reversed. In the end, the prices of various yarns rose and fell differently.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix yarn opened low at 470,000 yuan, was once pushed up to 510,000 yuan, and finally fell back to 490,000 yuan, a slight decrease of 5,000 yuan from the previous day. 32-count Silver Moon yarn finally rose by 25,000 yuan, closing at 185,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods rose steadily from 280,000 yuan to close at 325,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 29,000 yuan. Factory orders were 310,000 yuan, and one-day arbitrage was 13,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse opened at 290,000 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was quoted at 285,000 yuan, an increase of 10,000 yuan from the previous day. In addition, Golden Rooster and Golden City yarns also showed slight improvement. Grades below 16-count weakened.</p>
<p>The fabric market continued to decline. The tight credit situation in the market intensified, and no parties showed any intention of purchasing. Various fabrics were unable to rally and ultimately closed lower. The leading fine cloth chips were even tighter, and there were still no transactions in the market. As for off-market quotes, they were generally similar to the previous day, with prices around 12,000 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors of speculative buying were strong, and it was said that some people were still buying at 13,000 yuan. Trumpet Boy fine cloth rose from 9,500 yuan to a high of 10,150 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 9,600 yuan.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji opened low at 9,500 yuan, rose to 10,300 yuan at one point, and the closing price fell back slightly to 9,750 yuan, a decrease of 950 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Straight Cloth retreated within the 10,000 yuan mark, opening at 9,600 yuan. Jumping Carp Yuan Guang Twill fell by 700 yuan, closing at 5,600 yuan. The sales of other fabrics were sluggish, and prices changed little.</p>
<h3>Market Restores Free Trading; Rice Prices Decline Slightly; Flour and Edible Oil Both Fall Then Rise</h3>
<p>The rice market yesterday lifted price controls, and free trading was restored in both the North and South markets. Covert transactions were transformed into open transactions. Due to tight credit conditions, the market was weak and prices were slightly lower than the previous day's black market prices by 100 to 200 yuan. In the South market, Bai Jing and Bo Cheng rice were both trading at 8,400 yuan. Although they strengthened slightly during the day, they weakened at the close, ultimately falling by 100 yuan. Early rice fell by a small amount of 200 yuan, high-quality goods were 8,000 yuan, and medium-grade and substandard goods retreated within the 8,000 yuan mark. Transactions in Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan were rare. In the North market, Bai Jing rice was 8,300 yuan, and Gao Zao Cheng rice fell to 8,000 yuan. Arrivals were 1,754 shi in the South market and 8,622 shi in the North market.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: The market trend was first down and then up. At the opening, the market was bearish due to extremely tight credit conditions and high interbank interest rates. At the opening, rapeseed oil was 31,500 yuan and soybean oil was 38,000 yuan. Later, due to the release of a very high cost of living index and strong reports of outside commodity prices, retail investors bought at low prices, and prices rose steadily. The highest price for rapeseed oil was 39,000 yuan, and the closing price was 38,000 yuan, an increase of 4,000 yuan. The closing price for soybean oil was 44,000 yuan, an increase of 5,000 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil and other varieties all fell first and then rose. The closing price for soybean cake rose sharply by 300 to 400 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour: First down and then back up. At the beginning of the market, credit conditions were even tighter and interest rates were high. Rice prices fell, and sentiment became even weaker. Bingchuan opened lower by 220 yuan, trading at 3,500 yuan. In the middle of the market, buyers were eager to move, and sentiment was unanimously bullish. The closing price rebounded to 3,620 yuan. After the closing price, buyers were eager to purchase, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices. Market conditions continued to improve, and the closing price was 3,750 yuan. There were not many transactions in Lao Che flour, which opened at 3,850 yuan. Bran opened down 200 yuan, and rebounded by 20 yuan at the close. The closing price for Fuxin Large Package was 2,680 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains: The market trend fluctuated. Soybeans were slightly lower at the beginning of the market, but rebounded by 500 yuan after oil factories purchased them. The closing price for Che Dou was 7,300 yuan. Zha Dou opened at 6,000 yuan, but there were no transactions later in the market. Peanut kernels fell first and then rebounded. The supply of sesame seeds became scarce, and actual sales were smooth. Yellow sesame seeds rose sharply, and black sesame seeds were trading at 8,500 yuan. Corn and red sorghum rose slightly by 200 yuan. Selected green grains were slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Yesterday's timber market, although affected by the daily rise in other commodity prices, experienced only a slow increase in timber prices, lagging far behind other daily necessities. The spot price for fir was 45 yuan per foot, and the price for foreign pine was 150 yuan per foot.</p>
<p>Taishi Taihe Hing Bank recently launched a small-amount current account deposit service to develop its business. An account can be opened with a minimum deposit of 3,000 yuan, and a beautiful leather wallet is given as a gift.</p>
<p>Since the Lunar New Year, the rate of increase in hardware store prices has been quite significant, but because factory production has not returned to normal, actual sales are still rare. Apart from rebar, which is still in high demand for military use, there are few large-scale transactions. Only galvanized iron, lead sheet, and wire nails are experiencing brisk trade, with frequent buying and selling, making them more active than other items in the hardware category.</p>
<p>It is reported that in recent months, the single-person hardware trade from Hong Kong to Shanghai has disappeared. The reason is that hardware prices in Shanghai are sluggish, and prices in Hong Kong are higher than in Shanghai, making it unprofitable to transport goods. However, some materials, such as galvanized iron, are said to be flowing back to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The cigarette and soap market was initially tight due to extremely tight interbank lending rates, which rose to 120 yuan. However, due to Yong Tai He raising its price, the market became firm. Later, after the cost of living index was released, it was necessary to pay a premium on top of the market price to purchase goods at the close of the market.</p>
