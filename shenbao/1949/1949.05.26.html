<h3 id="c2">解放軍約法八章 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>中國人民解放軍佈告：</p>
<p>國民黨反動派業已拒絕接受和平條件，堅持其反民族反人民的罪惡的戰爭立傷。全國人民希望人民解放軍迅速消滅國民黨反動派，我們已命令人民解放軍奮勇前進，消減一切敢於抵抗的國民黨反動軍隊，逮捕一切怙惡不悛的戰爭罪犯，解放全國人民，保衡中國領土主權的獨立與完整，實視全鷗人民所渴望真正的和平與民主統一。人民解放軍所到之處，深望各界人民予以協助。茲特宣佈約法八章，願我全體人民共同遵守之。</p>
<p>（一）保擭全論人民的生命財產，谷界人民，不分階級信仰和職業，均望保持秩序，採取和人民解放軍合作的態度，人民解放軍則採取和各界人民合作的態度。如有反革命份子或其他破壞份子趁機搗亂，搶劫或破壞者，定予嚴辦。</p>
<p>（二）保護民族工商農牧業。凡屬私人經營的工廠·商店·銀行·倉庫·船舶·碼頭·農塲·牧場等，一律保護，不受侵犯。希望各業員工照常生產，各行商店照常營業。</p>
<p>（三）沒收官僚資本。凡屬國民黨反動政府及大官僚份子所經營的工廠·商店·銀行·倉庫·船舶·碼頭·鐵路·郵政·電報·電詁·自來水及農塲·牧場等，均由人民政府接管。其中如有民族工商農牧業家私人股份經調查屬實者，當承認其所有權。所有在官僚資本企業中供職的人員，在人民政府按管以前，均需照舊供職，並負責保護資財·機器·圖表·賬冊·檔案等，聽候淸點和接管。保護有功者獎，怠工破壤者罰。凡願繼續服務者，在人民政府接管後，准予量才錄用，不使流離失所。</p>
<p>（四）保護一切公私學校·聲院·文化敎育機關·體育塲所及其他一切公益事益。凡在這些機關供職的人員，均望照常供職，人良解放軍一律保護，不受侵犯。</p>
<p>（五）除怙惡不悛的戰爭罪犯及罪大惡極的反革侖份子外，凡屬國民黨中央·省·市·縣各級政府的大小官員·國大代表·立法監察委員·參議員·警察人員·區鎭鄕保甲人負，凡不持槍抵抗不陰謀破壞者，人民解放軍及人民政府一律不加俘虜，不加逮捕，不加侮辱。責成上述人員各安職守，服從人民解放軍及人民政府的命令，負責保護各機關資財·檔案等，聽候接收處理。這些人員中，凡有一技之長而無嚴電的反動行為或嚴重的劣績者，人民政府准予分別錄用。如有趁機陂壞·偷益·舞弊·携帶公款·公物·公案潛逃，或拒不交待者，則需予以承辦。</p>
<p>（六）為着確保城鄕治安，安定社會秩序之目的，一切散兵淤勇均應向當地人民解放軍或人民政府投誠報到。凡自動投誠報到，並將所有武器交出，概不追究。其有抗不報到或隱藏武器者，即予人民踴躍爭睹情形。逮捕查究。窩藏不報者亦需受相當的處分。</p>
<p>（七）農村中的封建的土地所有權制度是不合理的，應當廢除。但是廢除這種制度必須是有準備和有步驟的。一般地說來，應當先行減租減息，後行分配土地，並且需要人民解放軍到達和工作個相當長的時期之後，方才談的到認真地解決土地問題。農民羣眾應當組織起來，協助人民解放軍進行各項初步的改革工作，同時努力耕種使現有的產業生產水平不致降低，然後逐步加以提高，藉以改善農民生活，並供給給城市人民以商品糧食。城市的土地房屋，不能和農村土地問題一樣辦理。</p>
<p>（八）保護外國僑民生命財產的安全。希望一切外國僑民，必須遵守人民解放軍及人民政府的法令，不得進行間諜活動，不得有反對中國民族獨立事業及人民解放事業的行為，不得包庇中國戰爭罪犯，反革命份子及其他罪犯；否則當受人民解放軍及人民政府的法律制裁。</p>
<p>人民解放軍紀律嚴明，公買公賣，不許妄取民間一針一線。希望我全體人民一律安居樂業，切勿輕信謠言，自相驚擾。切切此佈。</p>

<p>〔香港訊〕華北人民政府已允許外國商人經營貿易。又據遠東經濟評論報載：自從香港對華北和東北中共當局關於貿易態度與手續的幼稚和不正確的認識怯除後，香港與華北的正規商業關係已經開始。任何國籍的商船與商人都十分喝望與華北恢復獲利甚厚的貿易。在短期的猶激不決之後，美國的商人和運輸公司也正積極的在與中共進行貿易。自然香港與華北貿易大多數仍為中國人。在與華北貿易時，雖然要遵守進出口貿易和海上交通等條例，其他方面都明顯的暗示出中共當局急切盼望發展貿易。在全中國金融混亂為新的秩序所代替前，大宗的貿易仍必須是以貨易貨為基礎，就今年而論，本地商人確信可以增加與華北和東北的貿易數量，而為著中國人的利益和全球的商業，運輸，航空，電訊，銀行與保險事業的進一步擴充與規定實有迅速組成的必要。又據某貿易界權威人士談稱：從現在所得各方面的資料，搶租而炒高，但一個優於其他貿易綫的利潤總是有的，少數商人期望於高利潤，實在是一個偏向。就目前所知，每一條去華北的船隻，都不致虧累，只是實際的純利有多有少，地區的物賢有好有壞；其買以前由香港運去解放區的貨物未必是解放區所條需供非所求，可能利潤較簿；交換到的物資，有的亦不為商人所喜，可以知道香港和華北包括天津在內的貿易，必然會漸漸更有進步，而將成為香港的正常貿易。</p>
<p>目前香港有少數經營解放生意的商行，似乎情緒低落很，這是理想太高的原故。因為解放區各口岸的貿易局都規定毛利在百分之四十以上，即使船租因香港大家都願意得到價值高，銷路暢的物資，因之得到不為所喜的物資時，就未免不快。要料正這個現象，就必須預先研究雙方的洪求關係。近日電訊所傳天津貿易局與商人訂立易貨合同，則將來港津貿易可以更循合理的路綫進行，因之，現在和未來的貿易情形必能改善得更好，唯一要緊的，是香港做解放區生意的，不要過份希望獲得高利潤，因為和解放區貿易，也是一種貢獸，而決不應該希望暴發。</p>

<h3 id="c19">發展嫩江　工業成績 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>〔東北通訊〕東北嫩江全省省營工業自去年七月會議後，本發展製造業，限制紡織業，縮減與合併糧食加工業三大方針及統經營合理調整後，各廠生產一般走上正軌，半年來收到很大成績。</p>
<p>首先統一了全省的工業，先後共接收工廠，作訪一二三處，資金總值一三，五七二，五六五，五一八元，其中糧米加工業共六十一處，資金總值七，一六九，四三四，三七八元，佔百分之五二，四，合併後為三十九處。紡織業全省原共十一處，合併後各市只貿三處，扶餘，安達各一處，共五處。領導也能集中力量經營了。半年中，先後建設了玻璃廠·製藥廠·製酒廠·火緘廠·啤酒廠（四處）及嫩江紡識廠附設的亞蔴廠·皮革廠附設的血子廠等十一處。共中除　廠尚須明年三月始能完成外，其他各廠均已先後開工生產。</p>
<p>目前全省共有工廠九十二處，總資金五九，九七九，七七五，〇四五元，其中；糧加工業卅九處，資金二八，五七三，五八六，五〇〇元，佔百分之四七八五，紡織業五處·資金九，九八三，〇八二，七三三元，佔百分之六，五九，其他各業賣金共計二一〇，四二三，一〇五，八一二元，佔百分之三五，五六。糧食加工業雖已下降，仍佔最大之比量。</p>
<p>半來各省營工廠生產情形，除三合建火磨外，一般生產正常，皮革廠完成生產計劃百分之一〇一至三六，嫩江紡織廠紡紗完成百分之一〇一·四八，新華紡織廠完成百分之一〇九·七，利民織布廠，完成百分之一一三·六三，兩個燒鍋完成百分之一一二至一一五，火柴廠完成百分之一〇八·〇六；嫩江及新華紡織廠因紗貴布賤，織布減少，只完成百分之八五·五七及百分之七五·六一；嫩江製藥廠等因初建生產尚未步入正規，未完成生產任務。各工廠統一後，由於工廠資金數字多與實際不符，故為確定各廠實行了清理倉庫工作，至九月底告結束。這一工作的完成，改變了全體職工對人民財產的認識，加強了保管組織及保管人負的職責，改善了保管方法，提高了工作效率，處理了不需要的物資，改進了倉庫設備，普遍建立了倉庫制度。早年來生產出的主要成品為：布—三，一三三疋，洋紗八七，一三五斤，火柴七二，四〇〇箱，麵粉八，三四四，九二九斤，燒酒七〇九，七一九斤，及其他高梁米，豆油，藥品，玻璃等物。按平均估價約值六八，三四六，一〇五，三三七元（副產品未計算在內），如以職工八，四三三人計算，平均每人生產總值（成本在內）為四七，六九四，四二一元，折合高梁米十七噸。如以純利一百七十五億計算，則每人給社會增加財富約值高梁八，七四○斤，約合農民生產的五倍。</p>
<p>半年中全省工業共盈利二○，四八三，六四－，九八五元，其中繳納任務佔百分之六一，五，留廠作為擴大再生產者佔百分之三八，四九。</p>
<p>半年來生產中，在改進技術與節省原料等方面都創造了一些經驗與成續。研究室于凱南與皮革廠于盛藻同志研究以松樹皮製造血料子成功，每斤樹皮產一·八兩至二兩血料子，日產五十四斤。製藥廠在工具設備極困難絛件下，以蜂蜜製成葡萄糖，以蛤蜊皮子製成鹽化鈣，並改進了製造注射藥等。凡正常生產的工廠均提高了產量，火柴由七月份的四五七箱，增至十月份的一六五箱，即培加了百分之二六二·一，每日增加產量百分之八七·二，嫩江紡織廠紡紗，由八月份的每錠平均產量三·〇五兩，提高到十一月份的三·八六兩；織布由七月份每台產布三四·八碼，增加到十一月份的三九·六碼；而紡紗達到了標準產量（四兩）的百分之〇·三，織布達到標準產量（四八獨）的百分之七九·九。織布率由八月份的百分之九七，增至十月份百分之九九·－，而減斤率則由百分之二·三減至百分之〇·八五。鞋廠製一雙皮鞋現已做到較前節省皮子二寸；玻璃廠用煤每日節省已達八二〇斤·另外為了減少開支，各工並有計劃的精簡非生產人員。目前各廠職工總數中，管理人員只佔百分之一四·五·半年來的發展整頓省營工業過程中，共獲得以下幾點經騐：（一）由於以往工業生產中的盲目無計劃性，統一的加以整理，加強領導集中資金是十分必要的。但全省工業為統一由省經營，則不僅顧此失彼，且減低各縣經營工業的典趣。故必須明確的省縣分工，在對全省工業生產統「領導之下分散經營　。（二）只有縮減剩餘的工業，才能抽出費金建設新廠，如安達，肇東的草包廠，嫩江的探木公司的資金都是這樣解決的。（三）建設新廠應該有比較周密的計劃一個新興的工廠都不是很短時間可以完成的。工人技術的熟練程度，設備的困難，原料的正常來源，銷路市場的開闢都需要相當的時間，不應急於求成，必須長期打算，才能突破一切困難，獲得有利的發展。</p>
<p>我省在發展副業上有豐富的條件，有些土產不但在全東北出各，甚至馳名中外，頗有發展前途，應作長期打算。我省副業有廣大發展前途的是畜收業，魚肉類：其次，城鹽硝及羊草，葦子是全東北著名的特產，產量極豐。編織業在最近一·二年有很大發展，此外各種細皮，藥材，山貨等亦有相當產量。接著在分析本省副業況後，他著重檢討過去商業部門對扶助副業解決銷路這一重要任務認識不足，貢默極差，今後必須把扶助副業生產和農業生產看得同樣軍要，積極的主動的給各種土產尋找銷路。並明確指出國家收購的與省縣調劑的各種士產是省縣商業部門今春發曉副業的重點。他並號召各縣同志回去在本縣副業生產中做詳細的調查拼究。根據可能銷路作出本縣土產調劑計劃，限期報省。</p>

<p>（路透社巴　廿四日電）西方三國外長今日拒絕蘇聯外長維辛斯基要求根據「波茨坦協定」，四強共管德國的建講。維氏在今日會議中首次發言，並要求參加魯爾工業區贊制，會議在甯靜友好的空氣中進行。按現在的魯爾區管理機構，是由英，美，法，比，荷，盧六國所組成。　外長許曼說：如果回復四強共管的舊機構，勢將重蹈以前的錯誤。美國務卿艾契遜說：如果重返波茨坦時代的舊機構，無異叫一個已經回復三肢機能的新瘉病人，回到原來的狀態。英外相貝文強調說：西方列強己在西德成立了－個自由民主的政府，現在不擬放棄這個建樹。維辛斯基發表很長的演說，譴責西方列強違背波茨坦協定，企圖分裂德國。維氏所提建議的原文如下：</p>
<p>（一）為達成德國經儕及政治統一起見，（甲）恢復德國管制委員會，為行使德國最高權力的機構。（乙）恢復拍林四國聯合參謀部，籍以統一柏林全市行政，並保障柏林市民之正常生活。（二）鑒於德國中央政府未成立以前，德國的經濟和政治統一勢難達成，承認下列兩點為必要措施：（甲）依據東西兩區目前存在的德國經濟機構，成立一個全德政務委員會。（乙）恢復全柏林市政機構。至全柏林市政機構的選舉日期問題，交由柏林四國聯合參謀部考慮決定。」維辛斯基說；國際管制的最好辦法，是成立一個以強代表機構，和德國毗鄰各國得推派代表以諮詢資格列席會議，同時德國經濟團體亦得推派代表。一四強外長今日討論德國統一問題，歷時約三小時，維辛斯基首先離席。西方三國外長在宮中酒排閒邊飲邊談，約廿五分鐘。預料明日下午四時舉行第三次會講時，將繼續討論德國統一問題。（圖為維辛斯基）</p>

<p>〔新華社北平廿五日電〕塔斯社羅馬訊：特里埃斯特目由區的英美佔領區將舉行市選。特里埃斯特城在六月十二日舉行，摩吉亞等五個市在六月十九日舉行。從競選的最初的日子起，特里埃斯特自由區共黨和民主組織的代表，就在羣眾會議上揭露美英佔領當局所製成的使真正選舉成為不可能的條件。佔領當局充分支持法西斯挑撥集團，迫害進步份于的事情不斷發生。為了在選舉時「維持法紀」，美英佔領當局已準備了一萬七千人的警察，其中七千為美國及英國軍事警察，這就意味著每二十個人民中，就有一個警察。美英當局已專橫地從選民的名單上取消約二千人，其中許多是游擊隊員和反法西斯分子，理由是這些人曾在過去被法西斯（特別法庭）判處徒刑。美英當局阻得競選運動，不許共產黨組織舉行會議，同時美英當局卻違反和約，將數千名一九四〇年六月十日以後返抵特里埃斯特的人列入選民各單上。為鼓勵特里挨斯特的「義大利社會運動」派和其他反動團體的法西斯宣傳，美英當局事先在該地對前游繫隊員進行了一連串審訊，甚至在競選雲動中，還繼續逮捕前游擊隊員，和非法地搜查進步團體的住宅。軍事當局並鼓勵法西斯分子進行反對共產黨代表的公開演說。據羅馬團結報訊，特里埃斯特自由區共產黨與若干民主羣眾團體發表特別文告，斥責美英當局的暴政，並將美英在特里埃斯特自由區所實行的選舉政策通知聯合國秘書處。按特里埃斯特自由區位於義大利和南斯拉夫之問的亞特里亞海北岸，是根據四國外長會議協議設置的。現美英南三國軍隊仍分駐自由區內。</p>
<h3 id="c38">美著名女劇人　凱薩琳考尼爾剪影 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>凱薩琳·考尼爾在一九四八年五月演完了莎士比亞的「安東尼與克里奧派屈拉」，這樣，她就達成了她的心願。因為，這個卓越的美國女演員，其生平的最大希望就是扮演這個埃及女皇，她並且認為這位埃及女皇是莎士比亞筆下最完全的女性。她演這個戲也打破了所有的記錄，因為這戲連演了二百五十一場。</p>
<p>克里奧派屈拉乃是由考尼爾主演的第三十三個角色。考尼爾在美國劇壇上活躍已達三十年，她曾經扮該過茱麗葉·聖·瓊·安提康·伊利薩白·布朗寗·「小婦人」中的屬等等女性，她除了担任演員在外，也還在其他方面對於美國劇壇有所貢獻。她和她的丈夫麥克林狄克合作的結果，已經使她成為一個成功的演出者。她向美國觀眾介紹了許多不很出名的演員，並使他們成功。這批演員的名單中包括伊芬斯，這個英國演員曾經扮演羅密歐（當她扮演朱麗葉的時候），奧遜威爾斯（他現在是好萊塢的製片人），法籍影星亞蒙特，電影明星格雷哥里派克等等。許多看戲的人，都同意紐約時報劇評家的說法，而擁戴考尼爾為美國劇壇上的第－個女性，在這個寶座上，她是無人堪與匹敵的。</p>
<p>考尼爾女士於一九三一年想上演「巴里克」一劇的時侯，也曾遭受反對。差不多有二十七個以上的劇院經理人對這個劇本表示反對，因為他們想，觀眾們是不會喜歡一個生病的女生角的。後來，連她自己都有點失去信心了，但他的丈夫堅持要她演那個戲，而結果呢，也就證明了那戲正是他們最著名的成功。</p>
<p>家庭反對學戲</p>
<p>雖然考尼爾女士自小　淫於戲院的氣氛之中，但她的父母一直反對她成為一個女演員，她的父親是考尼爾博士，考尼爾博士雖然愛好劇院，但卻學了醫科，當他在柏林做醫學院的研究生時，他的年青的妻子生下了第一個孩子凱薩琳。等他們回到布法羅德時候，考尼爾博士放棄了醫藥而變成了「星光劇院」的經理。當她第一次看戲的時候，就非常感動。她對於學校絕少興趣，但對於運動則頗有成就—例如網球及壘球。她沒有考取大學，結果她就回到她原來的學校中去教授戲劇。她的家庭反對她演戲，他們設她的臉太寬，嘴太大，人太瘦，而且一點也不動人。但雖然如此，她在一九一六年還是到了紐約去當女演員了。最初，她祇演極不重要的角色，而後來又曾有兩年什麽戲也沒有演。</p>
<p>劇院經理告訴她說：「你並不是屬於戲劇界的人，回家嫁個好男孩子吧」！</p>
<p>她現在說：「假定我僅僅是喜愛戲劇的話，那兩年的時光一定會將我逼回老家的」。</p>
<p>最後，她的機會終於來了，她參加了傑賽劇團，她演了一年的女傭之類的角色，直到她跟著這個劇團的到倫敦，她才分到了重要的角色：「小婦女」中的蜀。</p>
<p>由於這次的演出，她接著受聘規任克萊門司，丹恩的「離婚的約法」一戲在美國演出時的女主角。當這戲在排演中時，她和她五年之久的年青的導演麥克林蒂克結婚了。</p>
<p>自從一九二五年以來，所有由考尼爾女士主演的戲都是麥克林蒂克所負責演出的。她所演過的戲之中，包括：「稚年」，「綠帽」，如不榮譽的女性」「鑄情」，「聖〔貞」，「醫生的難題」，「安東尼與克里奧漢屈拉」。她從一九四八年春季開始，就在尋覓一個新的劇本。</p>
<p>運動與化裝</p>
<p>考尼爾女士擁有一種「令人慕戀的和有流動性的面貌」。她身段苗條而結實，並擁有一種運動家的莊嚴感。她的網球和高爾夫球都打得很好，敎她打高爾夫的先生甚至勸他放棄舞臺而奪取高爾夫球的冠軍。</p>
<p>她自稱對於衣著無甚興趣，並不考究；而且除了在舞台上以外絕不用化裝品，她在演出戲劇以前很少耗費時間於穿衣，理髮。</p>
<p>她拒絕了促使她上銀幕的建議。她不願離開舞臺來耗費時間於學習電影技術。她喜歡「使自己的精神直接供給觀眾，並和觀眾的精神乳水交融，……正像電流一樣地，透過舞合上的腳燈，而將演負和觀眾聯在一起。」</p>
<p>考尼爾女士為了觀眾，不惜　　很遠的路程。有一年，她曾和句括五十個人的劇團一面旅行「一面演出三個戲：「坎的達」，「巴里克一家」和「籌情」。她們曾經歷一萬六千哩，出演於七十五個不同的地方。</p>
<p>有一個聖誕夜，她們因為洪水的延阻，抵達西雅圖時已經下午九時。他們希望將原定的當日演出取消，但是結果發現民眾們正熱烈地等待著她們。於是，大家就匆忙地在觀眾注視之下捲起了佈景，考尼爾女士在半夜的一點十分正式登傷，那戲演完的時侯，己是清晨四點鐘了。（美國新問處稿）</p>

<p>華北貿易總公司，為了供應各地人民燃煤的需要，己在三月三十日在天津成立了平津煤鐵公司，任命李南生為經理·范菊秋為副經理。經營的範圍，包括開　·長城·門頭溝·井陘·陽泉等地所產的煤，和各種生熟鐵與原料，並辦理煤鐵出口事宜。除了在天津設立煤業公司第二·第三·第四煤礦外，在北平·保定·秦皇島設立分公司，唐山·塘沽·門頭溝設立辦事處，勝芳·鄭州設立分銷處。</p>
<p>在華北地下蘊藏的資源，以煤為最豐富，據地址調查所的估計：華北七省煤的藏量，共有二千一百二十五億公噸，其中以山西·河北為最多，且全部都屬於古生代，上部的煤層厚度，從一百公尺到二百二十公尺，下部煤層厚度，則自一百公尺到一百五十公尺。如將土地面積和埋藏量作一比較，每平方公里約十五萬六千公噸，而全國計算，每平方公里約二萬二千公噸。再以人口計算，華北每人約有一千五百公噸，而全國平均，每人約五百五十公噸。</p>
<p>再就平津煤鐵公司管理下的各鑛來看，情形如下：</p>
<p>礦名　煤質　埋藏量　產量</p>
<p>開溁　粘結煤　六億九千萬噸　四百萬噸</p>
<p>長城　無煙煤　七萬噸</p>
<p>門頭溝　無煙煤　五十萬噸</p>
<p>井陘　粘結煤　二億二千一百萬噸　一百萬噸</p>
<p>陽泉　無炳煤　二十萬噸</p>
<p>煤是一切生產事業的動力和泉源，尤其是華北各礦質，較他處為優。像開　·井　的粘結煤，為煉製焦炭的最好原料。無粘結性的煤，為火車及其他鍋爐的優良燃料，有固體汽油的雅號。過去抗戰期中，日人曾以煤試煉人造石油，用低溫乾　法，聽說結果頗為良好。</p>
<p>平津地區解放後，地下寶藏方面的產量日見增加。現今更成立了平津煤鐵公司，來辦理分配運銷的事務，不僅各地人民的燃料得以充沛，各項工業也能因之蒸蒸日上了。</p>

<p>中國國民黨革命委員會上　臨時分會告上海同胞書，原文如下，親愛的上海同胞們：現在大上海已經解放我們五百萬人民日夜所期望的日子終於到來了。這次上海的解放，不僅是人民解放軍的偉大勝利，不僅是各民主黨派聯合陣機的勝利，而是上海五百萬人民反抗黑暗勢力的勝利。我們要以興奮的情緒，慶祝大上海的解放，我們要以熱烈的情緒，迎接人民解放軍的來臨。</p>
<p>蔣介石匪幫的反動政府，是軍閥官僚豪門買辦的垃圾集團，他們這一羣個個都是吸血虫，他們千方百計，沒有一分鐘沒有一秒鐘，不在設法吃吸中國人民的血液，來養肥他們自己。他們在道次自己發動的屠殺人民的反革命戰爭中，雖然失敗得很慘，但是匪首蔣介石還能逃到華南，企圖結集殘餘的反動力量，作最後的掙扎。我們上海人民雖然已經得到解放，但是整個中國還有不少同胞在蔣介石匪幫的淫威之下，過著奴隸的生活，所以上海人民固然應該為勝利而興奮，為解放而狂歡，然而興奮狂歡之餘，我們還要堅強的站起來繼續奮鬥，澈底消減一切反動軍隊，解放全國的人民。同時在上海方面，我們深信潛伏在地方的反動特務份子戰爭罪犯一定不少，他們無時無地不想繼續屠殺上海人民，妨礙中國解放事業的進度。他們是我們人民的敵人，我們要跟這些潛伏的反動勢力，作你死我活的鬥爭，檢舉他們，清算他們，以及澈底的消滅他們。革命必須貫澈到底，革命與反動，光明與黑暗，絕對不能妥協。我們只有把一切反動勢力斬草除根以後，新民主主義的新中國才能夠出現。</p>
<p>新民主主義的內容，與孫中山先生的革命三民主義是相同的。在新民主主義的新中國裏，人人一律平等，人人都有自由，人人有飯吃，人人有事做，絕對沒有人吃人的現象。革命的目的，不是破壞而是建設。我們在消極方面固然要繼續奮鬥，澈底毀滅反動勢力；積極方面還要加倍努力，把四億五千萬人民的心結成一顆心，把四億五千萬人民的力量結成一股力量，流血流汗，羣策羣力，建設一個新民主主義的新國家。上海是全國經濟的重心，上海是建設新中國的資本，我們五百萬上海人民應該站在全中國人民的前面，各人守著自己的崗位，增加生產，積極工作，為建設新中國而流盡我們最後的一滴血，最後的一滴汗。我們的意志要堅定，我們的精神要抖發，一滴血一滴汗絕對不是白流的。</p>
<p>親愛的上海同胞們！黑夜巳經過去，天已經亮了，今後我們可以過民主自由的生活了。沒有人吸我們的血，沒有人吃我們的肉，不過現在我們對殘餘的反革命勢力，還需要作艱苦的奮鬥，同時為實現新民主主義的新中國，也需要作積極的奮鬥。主主義的新中國，也需要作積極的奮鬥。</p>

<p>讓我們歡呼人民解放軍解放上海的偉大勝利！自從國民黨反動派在美帝國主義的援助下，違背人民意志，破壞停戰協定及政治協商會議決議，向中國人民發動全國規模的反動戰爭以來，我愛國學生·工人·及民主人士橫遭逮補槍殺，無辜平民備受剝削迫害，學校被摧殘，工商業被壓榨到解體等情事，均為我上海同胞所深知。</p>
<p>我們中國民主同盟因為努力中國的民主·和平·團結·統一，堅持政浩協商會議的決議案，自卅六年遭到國民黨反動政權的迫害，被反動政府的內政部宣佈為非法而予以解散以後，本盟盟員在全國各地被非法拘補殺害者，數以千計。但本盟總部不為威武所屈，自在香港重建總盟機構後，即號召全國轉入地下工作同志為反帝·反封建·反獨　的民主革命統一戰綫而奮鬥到底。我上海市全體盟員同志，雖時刻在恐怖艱險之中，從朱敢怠懈此神聖工作。今後，我們更要與全國同胞。中國共產黨及其他民主黨派精誠合作，繼續為堅決澈底殲滅中國境內一切反動勢力，解放全國人民而努力。</p>
<p>解放上海的人民解放軍，是我們人民自己的軍隊，將在新民圭主義的原則下，切實實施保護人民的生命財產，扶助民族工商業，培植文化教育事業，改著工農生活等政策。我上海同胞應各安職守，勿　驚恐，服從民主政府法令，維持社會秩序，檢舉陰謀破壞的特務份子。國家銀行國營企業應照常工作，靜候接管，商店照常營業，工廠照常開工，學校照常上課，發展生產，繁榮經濟，公私兼顧，勞資亙利，以重建新上海，建設新中國。本盟願與各界同胞共勉之！</p>

<h3 id="c42">「原子醫生」 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 哈瑪氏原作</p>
<p>原子時代中的醫藥故事，證明了那產生原子彈的同一科學，是可以防止而非造成痛苦與死亡的。當一九四五年五月戰事在大琉球島上糖塔山進行的時候，有一個美國海軍陸戰隊倒下來了，而且受著了嚴重的創傷。醫藥隊的隊員立刻迅速她給他輸血，結果他是救活了。在戰爭結束以前，千百萬人都曾以同樣的方法而起死回生。但假使沒有一位「原子醫生」，血庫制度是不可能建立的。</p>
<p>在美國，有一個病人躺著等待著施行手術鋸去他受傷的一條腿。許多醫生們互相商討著：他們是否可以保留他的膝骨關節呢？價定留下那個膝骨關節，再加上一條假腿，他就可以差不多和往日一樣地行走了。他們必需迅速地決定。</p>
<p>他們運用了一種新的技術，決定了他膝骨關節附近的血流動是正常的，鋸斷小腿就足夠了。於見感謝「原子醫生」，這個人是司以過一個正常的生活了。</p>
<p>在另一個醫院裏，有一個病人因為一種看來不可救治的白血球過多症而瀕於死亡了。但結果由於那同一個裏聰　的原子醫生，這位病人終於離開了醫院，他至少是司以安度幾年有興趣的生活了。</p>
<p>其他的原子活動，包括甲狀腺及紅血球過多症的相當成功的治療，以及用分裂原子而得的放射性同位素來進行的疾病診查。這些重要的研究如果繼續下去而能成功，則將造成一個更加偉大的時代。正在進行中的實驗，正想以原子武器掉轉頭來對付人類的可怕敵人。科學家應用原子炸彈產生的放射能，可以設法覓出若干最可怖的疾病與毒癌的根源。在向原子能對毒癌所作的研究加以考察以前，我們可以生看一看什麼是原子醫藥工具和它們怎樣會造成上述種種的成就。</p>
<p>醫藥的研究者，利用新的原子方法，發現了放射性的同位素是一個潛在的盟友。任何一個化學元素的同位素，都是一個比較那個正規原子更重或者更輕的化學元素。但除了這一點重量的差別以外，同位素所具有的性質，是和正規的化學元素完全一樣的。當然，有些元素，它本來就是具有放射性的，例如鈾。利用同位素相同的性質和它們放射綫體的能力，就可以使它們在活著的組織中成為一種價值的「追溯體」（Taacers），和作為一種載負輻射綫達到平素不能達到的身體部份的醫療媒介物。</p>
<p>在一九四六年六月十四日以前的十年中，研究的團體發現了；要獲得極少數量的放射性，是既困難又費錢的。可是，在那一天，美國陸軍部宣佈說；現在已經有一百種不同元素的同位素在田納西橡嶺的連鎖反應鈾堆中產生出來了，這種同位素，將有相當大的數量，按低廉的代價源源不絕的供給研究，尤其是醫藥方面的研究。因此，美國再不需要依賴負擔奇重而效率低下的賓鹼室工具了。許多權威並且立刻領測說：同位素的豐當供應將大大地加速原子醫藥的進步速度。</p>
<p>但她在第二次世界大戰的初期，並沒有這麼多的伺位素存在。雖然如此，由於那一點微小的數量的同位素，仍然造成了許多奇跡。舉例說：有一次，美國軍醫當局發現必需要將大量的血液，從亞洲運到歐洲並作長期貯藏，載至那時候為止，還沒有發現一種方法可以使血球維持幾天功夫以上的生命。但事實上的要求則是要找出一種能保存血液並使其保有三個星期以上的生命的方法，而且這方法需要很快地找到。為了要出這種方法，就需要試騐許多種的化學溶液和它們的性質，而試騐許多溶液是要花費許多時間的。</p>
<p>結果，來自麻塞諸薩州理工學院與哈佛大學的一組物理學者解決了這個問題。他們的解決方案是利用鐵的化合物注射到血管裏去的時候，就被血色素的分子吸住了來製造紅血球的這一事實。由於這一個現象，它們就可以利用放射性同位素的鐵來「逍溯」貯藏在各個溶液麥的血液的行為。他們的第一步手續，是在麻塞諸　州的原子爆擊機中製造鐵的同位素，然後將少量的同位素鐵導入輸血者的血管中。十天到十四天後，鐵質已被同化成為血球的時侯，再由輪血者放出血液，並將這同一血液導入各種保存血液的溶液中。</p>
<p>於是這些溶液就被按各種不同的溫度，作相當時期的貯藏，而最後，就進行輸血了。輸血後，有一稱名呌季格針算機（Geiger　countet）就被用來檢查每個受血人身上同位素所發出的放射綫。假定這種放射綫在輪血後更快就消滅，那就表示溶液中保存的大部份紅血球都已經死亡了，而其所放出的放射性鐵，也已經更快地從血液中被消減了。</p>
<p>用這樣一種方法來剔除不滿意的化學溶液，紅西蘭的科學家們很快發現了一種ABC即酸性檸檬酸葡萄糖（Acitiate　dextrose），這種溶液可以在華氏四十度到五十度的冰箱內，使血液保有生命自廿一日到廿六日之久。於是這種化合物就很快地被用以運輸血漿及紅血球來救治太平洋區內十萬以上的傷兵了。在若干危急情形之下，有些貯藏了四十天的血液依舊很成功地完成了輸血手續。</p>
<p>檢查身體各部以決定是否需要進行外科手續。　　運用一種「追溯」的技術。這技術是以放射性的同位素注射入血液中，然後以「季格計算器」來注視那種放射性粒子的旅行。在一種血液流行狀況良好，而其組織正在猛烈地吸收其急迫需要的食物和養氣的情況之下，鋸斷的手續是並無必要的。</p>
<p>道裏所舉的兩個原子醫藥的例子，就是利用放射性而來探索有生命細胞的情形。如果用較強的同位素劑，它司以摧毀人體組織中有病的與惡性的生長。白血球過多症是一種可以使骨髓中產生不正當的大量白血球的病病，這一種病癥就可以用注射多量濃縮同位素而暫時使其痊可。上面提到的一個白血球過多病的病人，後來就是用注射放射性的磷而暫時治愈的。放射性　所發出的放射綫，減低了骨髓的活動性，而白血球的數量也就漸漸地減少了。在連續注射以後，這病人終於離開了醫院，他是至少可以有相當時期不再痛苦。</p>
<p>另－個是紅血球過多癥（Polysytlenria），這種病癥的特微就是紅血球過多，而這種病症，也是可以用放射性磷而使其減輕的。又有一種甲狀腺機能亢進症，也照樣可以藉放射性同位素而予以治療，又由於甲狀腺會吸收身體中百分之九十九的磷，所以醫生們可以放心運用放射性碘。</p>
<p>原子醫藥方面最近的成績，是不勝枚舉的。你已經注意到：像自血球過多癥，紅血球過多症及甲狀原機能亢進症之所以發生，是山於某種組織長出了比較正常數量更大的產物的綠故。我們可以拿這一件事和癌病的定義來比較一下，「癌」就是一種由於身體中細胞瘋狂迅速地生長，以致摧毀了重要機構的混亂情形而造成的。很明白地，這種就已使人想起了癌症與上述病症在程度上的相似之處，而那些病癥已經證明可用原子醫藥予以解救了。（美國新聞處譯）</p>

<p>〔本報特稿〕三月廿四日，中國婦女第一次全國代表大會在北平召開，參加的代表，有西北、東北、華北、華東、中原等解放區，及國民黨統治地區，遠及海外華僑的婦女代表，可以稱得中國婦女革命史上的一次盛會。</p>
<p>會期十一天，獲得很豐滿的結果，會議決定了發表宣言，響應世界擁護和平大會，並推選代表出席等要案。在討論到目前中國婦女運動的方針和任務，各代表更顯得熱烈，紛紛競相發言。關於婦女運動的方針問題，大家一致擁護鄧顯超的意見和主張，他說：「不在松懈農村婦女工作的條件之下，以城市婦女工作為重心。」他又說：「婦女工作的任務，主要是發動和組織各階層婦女參加生產。」各女工代表當場一致地表示：今後要更加努力生產，在新中國的建設工作中，做模范，當英雄。農村的代表們聽了也很高興，西北解放區的農村勞動英雄劉金英在小組會上說：「農村婦女早有了任務，現在城市婦女也有了任務，大會要互相配合，互相學習，工作才有推進，全國勝利才能早日實現。」</p>
<p>四月三日，大會揭幕後第十一天，也是閉幕的一天，在盛大莊嚴的典禮中，完成了預定的任務。那一天，朱德司令和北平市葉劍英市長也蒞會。大會向朱德司令獻給人民領袖毛主席、朱德司令的兩位幅紅旗，朱德司令向大會受旗。獻給毛主席的旗上寫著「永遠跟著你前進。」獻給朱德司令的旗上寫著：「沒有今天解放軍的勝利，就沒有中國婦女的解放。」朱德司令在受旗後，即向代表致詞，希望代表們回去，團結全國婦女，完成新民主主義革命，建設新中國。在雷潔瓊致閉幕詞後，葉劍英市長也相繼講話。</p>
<p>在中國婦女全國代表大會閉幕的一天，也就是中華全國民主婦女聯合會也宣告成立的一天。在上一天，大會選出了中華全國民主婦女聯合會執行委員五十一人，留出了四名空額，待全國解放後再行補充。在三日大會主席劉亞雄宣講當選者名單，並宣告中華全國民主婦女聯合會的誕生，博得全場掌聲。五十一名執行委員的名單為：蔡暢、鄧穎超、何香凝、張琴秋、康克清、區夢覺、楊之華、劉亞雄、帥孟奇、羅瓊、許廣平、章蘊、楊蘊玉、張金保、李培之、李德全、田秀娟、陳少敏、丁玲、沈茲九、謝雪紅、羅叔章、張秀岩、李文宜、陸璀、曾孟君、烏蘭、錢正英、楊剛、王月村、雷潔瓊、李堅貞、楊芝芳、張子芳、李貞、馮秋明、李鳳蓮、戚元德、趙鋒、楊克冰、胡子嬰、趙世蘭、李伯贏、張曉梅、劉王立明、韓啓民、邱一涵、鄧康、陳波克、江怡。</p>
<p>中國婦女全國代表大會和中華全國婦女聯合會，在形式上，是革命婦女第一次的大結合。其實，後「五四」開始，中國婦女，就和工人，農民，革命的知識份子，，駢肩參加革命斗爭，已有三十多年了。中國第一次全國婦女代表大會籌備會副主任鄧穎超，三月廿七日在北平新華電臺廣播中，極力加以贊譽。他說：「中國的勞動婦女在革命中的英勇頑強的精神，對中國革命有了重大的貢獻，成為不可缺了的力量。」在對日抗戰的八年中，在解放區的廣大婦女團聚，響應中國共產黨的號召，以忘我的精神參加各種抗日工作。他指出：戰爭的兩年半中，動員了婦女有的勞動能力總數的百分之五十到六十，或支援前線，動員參軍，或參加生產，婦女們參加勞動生產的努力，已有很好的成績。特別是農村婦女的副業生產，即紡紗織布一項，在保證軍需民用自給運動發動後，大大的提高，一九四八年後方的生產，主要是靠婦女，因此大大的提高了婦女的地位。</p>

<p>東北公營企業　展開競賽運動</p>
<p>〔潘陽訊〕東北職工總會最近號召了東北公營企業職工展開生產競賽運動。競賽期間，各業均按照具體情況，斟酌處理，對於競賽獲勝利的人，一律發給獎狀和獎品，同時指出領導上如何從事積壓準備。</p>
<p>〔潘陽訊〕東北各地公營企業普遍展開生產大競賽運動，以迎接「五一」勞動節，哈爾濱電氣修理廠自二月一日開始競賽以來，兩個月內便完成了四個月的生產任務。該廠漂白粉部門原計劃在三月份生產漂白粉九十噸，但至三月廿四日即生產了一百一十噸，（伪滿時最高月產量為一百零八噸），該廠鹽酸月產量已達一百一十八噸，超過伪滿時代月產量二十八噸。修理部正爭取在「五一」時實現提前兩個月完成一九四九年上半年的修理計劃。東北第三煤鑛區第二鑛採取個人，小組訂計劃，以坑口為單位進行競賽的辦法。在三月上旬的八天中，全鑛產量達三千二百一十六噸，超過預定計劃的百分之二十二。該鑛第一煤鑛區競賽期間在採掘方法上有很大的改進。如第一坑一個挖煤洞由於改變採掘法，日產量由一百餘噸增至二百餘噸，採掘率由百分之三十增至百分之六十。阜新煤鑛局孫家灣鑛，自展開競賽以來，採煤量已後每日每人平均三噸增至六噸，工人崔義的採煤量增至十噸。東北毛織廠由於在開展競賽運動中經過黑板報及時進行表揚和批評，同時積極改善工人伙食，產量質量均有提高。該廠棉織部一個址即由日產棉布一百四十疋增至二百疋。錦州織路局機務段爭取在四月上旬完成兩臺典型機車。其他工業城市如安東，吉林，長春，齊齊哈爾，牡丹江等的鐵路，軍工，紡織，膠皮，造紙，電業等公營企業職工，亦正積極為完成競賽計劃而努力。</p>
<p>鐵路礦山工廠　培養技術工人</p>
<p>〔潘陽訊〕潘陽，哈爾濱，撫順等地鐵路，礦山，工廠為提高技術，改進質量，正有計劃的培養技術工人，組織技術學習。潘陽皇姑屯鐵路工廠機械分廠一百六十名工匠中，技術不熟練的工匠，佔總數的百分之三十，因此培養技術工人，便為該分廠當前的一項主要工作。該廠行政上首先向技術工人進行教育，著重打破他們保守技術的舊觀念，然後吸收工長，組長，老技術工人的意見，訂出培養技術工人的辦法：（一）改變過去不交給不熟練工匠單床的現象，讓他單獨負責一臺，由工長，組長，老技術工人，多做具體幫助，使其熟練得更快。（二）盡量使幫工匠和不熟練的工人，先幹簡活，逐漸的再由淺入深。（三）組織技術學習，把幫工匠，不熟練的工匠和學徒，編成幾個小組，由老技術工人輪流講解技術理論。現該廠已根據上述辦法著手進行。潘陽汽車十一廠根據工人代表會的意見，在不影響生產的條件下，組織了職工業餘技術講習班，由技術人員與經驗豐富的工友擔任教員，採取多講實用技術的教學方法，幫助工友學習汽車構造學，修理法，電氣學及故障檢查法等。哈爾濱機械鐵工廠成立了技術研究會，研究中心著重工作方法，生產中遇到的實際困難和如何識別各種材料及其性能，如何使用工具機器等。該廠紅爐，翻沙兩股將生產中的問題提到研究會後，經有經驗的工友技術交換意見，用一邊做一邊研究的方法，解決了很多鍛造辦法，並提高了成品的質量。該廠決定凡在研究中確有成績的會員，經研究會公選提交工廠管理委員會批準後，可獲模范研究者的獎勵，撫順煤礦局製油廠為提高員工的製油技術，理論知識，正積極進行有關此項資料的翻譯工作，同時為解決潤滑油，汽油，硫磺，石臘等技工的困難，該廠正籌辦各種技術訓練班。</p>
<p>撫順電瓷工廠　產量達最高峯</p>
<p>〔潘陽訊〕撫順電瓷製造廠三個月來共製造高低電壓絕緣瓷二十一萬六千件，平均每月出產六萬二千多件，創造了該廠成立十四年以來的最高紀録。在偽滿時代，該廠最高紀録平均每月出產三萬二千件。目前產品質量亦已大大提高，成品佔燒壞量的百分之八十四，在最近一次燒壞中，成品竟提高到百分之九十四點四。該廠的這些成績，主要是工人們發揮高度的生產熱忱的結果。現該廠正努力完成今後四個月內生產高壓電瓷二十五萬件的計劃。</p>
<p>〔天津訊〕在天津市人民政府和華北總　工會籌委會辦事處的正確領導之下，天津市私營的恒源和北洋兩大紗廠勞資關係，已經得到初步改善，恒源紗廠的產量已經達到解放前的水平，北洋紗廠的產量，比剛解放的時候提高了百分之十五以上，所以恒源紗廠平均每天出產二十枝的紗四十五件，每件四百磅，生產布四百疋，比剛解放的時候產量提高了百分之六十八。北洋紗廠現在平均每天產紗三十七件，因為合理解決了勞資關係，浪費原料的現象也大大減少，兩廠的廠方，正在大力搜購原料，積極擴大生產。</p>
<p>天津生產猛進　超過預定目標</p>
<p>〔天津訊〕津市張貴莊鐵路工廠，像膠配件廠等公營企業單位，勝利完成或超過了三月份的生產計劃，天津機廠在貨車，客車，汽車等檢修工作上超過了原訂計劃的百分之八至八十，而日用廢棄材料修覆了拖拉機一部，橡膠配件廠生產的汽車外胎和電瓶榖等都完成了計劃，自行車內外胎則超過計劃百分之十至二十，天津汽車製配廠大部產品都如期完成，蓄電池，吉姆西活塞環等還超過了計劃。天津汽車修理廠完成了修車八十二輛的計劃，其中大修的有四十輛，超過二月份大修數量的百分之六十。自來水廠修錶房七個工人中抽了一個去學習，還修錶二百三十六個，較原訂計劃多修三十六個，與二月份相較，則多修了六十七個。同廠管子房的裝水錶及修理風泵等工作都超過了計劃，公共汽車管理處河北修車廠的修車工作也順利完成。各企業單位職工們在工作中曾發揮了高度的積極性，自動延長工作時間，充分利用廢料改進技術和管理，克服了許多困難。有些工廠的職工還展開了生產競賽。這是完成超過生產計劃的關鍵，但個別企業的生產計劃，由於沒有根據實際生產能力，又未發動職工討論，致無法完成。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕天津解放後，在人民政府積極的領導與幫助下，公私工廠迅速的復工，以配合全國解放戰爭及發展生產繁榮經濟的建設總目標。解放前，達生廠曾受帝國主義與官僚資本的種種壓迫排擠，對廠內工人也盡力壓榨。解放後，該廠在人民政府的幫助下，於一月十九日正式復工。該廠職工工作組一面根據實際情況，勸導資方逐步解放工人的合理要求，一面大力貫徹教育政策，做了適當的調整。同時宣布解散工會，停止工會頭子的一切活動，對個別作惡多端，為　衆深惡痛絕的工會頭子，則予以洗刷。</p>
<p>由於上述原因，職工生產情緒日益提高，一般工人遲到早退現象已經消除，保全科的工人，為了增加生產，想盡各種方法，七湊八拼的補齊了細紗機上的空錠子，並使七天任務四天完成。皮棍房工友趙繼明，在原料，零件異常困難的情況下，迅速的將空軍的皮棍做齊。電務組的工人，過去如修理一次鋼絲間的大馬達，六個至少要四點鐘，現在兩點鐘就完了。修理科的工人二十天趕做了鐵筐，鉛絲筐八十個，以此代替竹筐，鐵筐比竹筐耐用得多，但價錢比竹筐卻便宜二百元。在節省原料上，工人們均自動的將地上的棉花收拾起來，紗綻上的線斷的很少了。由於細紗間的工友能夠自覺的愛惜材料，使每天平均損破八十五對皮棍減少到四十對。打軸機的工人，利用廢料，經三天鑽研改進，每星期能節省棉花十餘磅，生產管理人員，也負起了應有責任，有的且很積極的幫助工人整理機器，捲棉紗了。因此使該廠產量，質量均超出了解放前的正常生產水平，而達到前所未有的程度。如解放前，該廠平均每錠每小時產廿支紗、〇三一磅，現在平均每錠每小時產廿支到、〇三四五磅，較解放前提高百分之十一點二。質量方面也有顯著改進，棉紗色白且勻，因之，銷路甚　，每包（四百磅），市價較前提高一千至二千元。</p>
<p>民營工廠甦生　半數已經復活</p>
<p>〔天津訊〕四區的四十二家工廠過四區工作組以及有關部門的共同努力，到四月上旬已經有十九家工廠復工，另有十四家工廠正在積極籌備開工，僅有九家或因遭砲火破壞，或因無人負責，短期內無法開工。</p>
<p>天津解放後，一般工廠的資方都不了解人民政府的工商政策，所以四區的四十二家工廠直到二月下旬才只有八家開始生產，區政府於是在二月二十三日召集各廠負責人開座談會，除由工作人員解釋工商政策以外，並縣城由若干已經開工的廠家負責人講說他們的經驗與看法。這次會議很生效，使一些廠家了解了「勞資兩利」是勞資雙方經過民主討論後的決定，並且要得雙方的同意。他們的疑慮減少了，會議以後半個月內，就有十一家復工了。</p>
<p>四區內其他未能開工的工廠已經大部份沒有勞資糾紛。</p>
<p>萊陽改善生活　組生產推進社</p>
<p>〔萊陽訊〕萊陽城是魯東一個工商業比較發達的城市，是花生，芋頭，蔴皮，栗子的集散地，在抗戰的八年中，它受著敵偽長期的搶劫，搜括，使得人民生活艱難困苦，商店歇業，工廠倒閉，一九四五年八月，萊陽解放，民主政府發給了救濟糧和發放了救濟貸款，人民的生活才開始改善。</p>
<p>一九四六年七月初，生產推進社成立時，工作方針及業務還定得不具體，只是原則上確定「扶助　衆生產，為　衆服務。」</p>
<p>九月間，推進社離開了鄉村，搬進城來，確定今後業務為發展紡織業。</p>
<p>生產推進社碰見了困難，便想法解決這些問題，使紡織業得以發展。</p>
<p>（一）主動的與區村聯系，構通關係，共同成立生產推進委員會，統一研究佈置與恢復城關的生產工作。</p>
<p>（二）具體掌握典型人向外推動，發展紡員人數。</p>
<p>（三）利用獎勵辦法，逐步提高技術，刺激著紡員的發展，紡線質量提高，提高紡婦的積極性。</p>
<p>（四）及時解決困難，幫助發展，保證原料的及時供給。</p>
<p>因為推進社適當地，正確地解決了以上四個問題，便從城內的紡織業擴展到山南關村，儒林村，又到和平村，到年底更普及到每一村去。</p>
<h3 id="c45">東北農業透視 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>東北各地，在東北行政委員會的領導和人民政府的獎勵下，積極增進農業生產，如糧食的增產，副業生產的進行，農具的製造，木材的砍伐等，已有顯著的成績。茲根據新華社迭次發布的電訊，　集記述如次！</p>
<p>加強春耕工作　積極增產糧食</p>
<p>東北行政委員會為了加強春耕工作組織的領導，動員和組織群眾積極生產，特頒佈農業生產令，通知各級政府，必須迅速動員幹部，動員和組織群眾積極從事生產，為完成今年增產一百八十萬擔糧食而奮斗。生產令中指出「承認已經分配了的一切封建財產屬於私人所有，準許個人自由經營，並且頒發地照，房證，確定地權，房權，確保由自己勞動僱人經營正常估息收入和特定條例下出租，土地所得，完全歸自己所有，保障交換自由，任何人不得侵犯。」此外對於有關農業生產的基本問題，也都作了規定。</p>
<p>東北行政委員會計劃今年春天在東北播種水田三百萬畝。去年東北只有水田二百一十一萬多畝，今年要恢復和增加八十八萬多畝。預計今年秋天可以多出產糧十四萬九千噸。</p>
<p>組織各地農民　進行副業生產</p>
<p>遼寗，遼西，熱河三省新解放地區民主政府正組織農民進行副業生產，準備春耕。遼陽縣縣政府已派出工作隊分赴災荒嚴重的地區發放救災貸糧，組織災民利用貸糧進行淘金，伐木，燒炭，打魚等生產。營口市郊農民在政府幫助下，組織了五百九十四個生產小組，進行運鹽，捕魚，拾糞，運輸等生產，已使二萬七千多人的生活得到初步解決。有些農民並已購置牲口等，積極準備春耕。熱河省新惠等地人民政府根據當地紡織業發達的特點，一面貸糧與貸棉籽款給災民作春耕資本，一方面由當地合作社貸出棉花一萬七千五百斤與織布機二十九架，動員了兩萬零七百多婦女參加紡織。遼西各縣普遍發動災民編蓆，紡織，大部地區災民已因此而解決了三，四個月的吃糧問題。</p>
<p>公營機械農場　生產情緒高昂</p>
<p>東北各地十二個公營機械農場的春耕準備工作將近結束，不久即可開始耕種、東北行政委員會農業部直接經營的黑龍江省立、合江省東安、嫰江省和潘陽的馬三家子等四所機械農場，在春耕準備和修理了房耕平道路和橋梁，目前正在進行種子消毒，只待土地解凍後，即可開犁春耕。上述四處農場，共有耕地五千四百五十坰，拖拉機五十二臺。此外，如松江、合江、嫰江、黑龍江、遼北、遼寗、吉林等七省的八所機械農場，春耕準備工作亦將結束。這八所農場共有耕地一萬零七百坰，拖拉機一百零八臺，並有共他新式農具。最近，東北行政委員會農業部已按照各農場拖拉機油料，燃料的需要程度，共補充汽油一百四十噸，種油三百六十噸。同時又撥出小麥種子三百一十噸，以便清明過後及時播煤。現各公營農場的職工會亦已成立，農業工人的生產情緒極高。</p>
<p>大量製造農具　提高農業生產</p>
<p>東北各地農民和公營農具製造廠，在人民政府獎勵下創製和改造了不少農具，以提高農業生產力。黑龍江省拜泉縣農民趙錦章製造馬拉播種機，能夠自動進行趟土，這種播種機經試驗，證明既節省勞力又播種得快。黑龍江省營農具工廠現正大量製造，推廣各地採用。又該廠製造的鋤草機，現亦試　成功，正由省農業廳有計劃地分發各地使用。嫰江省訥河縣農民試驗場，最近也創造了單限播種機和耘鋤播種機，功效較普通播種法可省三個人工一個馬工，耘鋤播種機較人工剷法省五個工，這兩種新造農具已製成一萬多架，正向缺乏人力畜力的地區推銷中。安東省臨江縣的勞動模范金自勝將普通耕犁改造為三把刺刀的開荒犁，經試驗結果，僅用新犁較普通開荒法可節省勞力三分之一，且可提高開荒效率三倍。這種新犁已由臨江縣農具工廠製成夠百多架，並由政府貸給農民使用。此外，合江、吉林、遼寗等省農具工廠，最近也在趕製大批新式農具，準備在春耕前貸給各地農民使用。</p>
<p>伐木任務完成　巨量木材待運</p>
<p>東北全區四百萬立方公尺的冬季伐木任務已全部完成。各省林務局刻正緊張地從事組織運輸的工作。此項鉅量木材的運輸任務計畫在今年年底完成。在四百萬立方公尺的木材中，經森林鐵路運輸者為一百六十三萬立方公尺，經流送運輸者為一百八十萬立方公尺，須經流送和森林鐵路雙重運輸作業者為四十三萬立方公尺，其餘由馬車、牲畜運輸。為了迅速完成運輸任務，各省林務局均將展開搶運競賽運動。東北林務總局已撥出鉅額獎金，準備獎給運輸模范。</p>

<p>〔本報特稿〕本年三月初，全國學生代表又在「五四」運動發祥地的北平，召開了中華全國學生第十四屆代表大會，在全中國人民民主革命勝利的前夕而舉行這個盛會。</p>
<p>在一九一九年五月六日，也就是「五四」運動爆發後第三天，「北京中等以上學生聯合會」在北平的大中學生主催下成立，同時是要使各地學生組織自己的全國性的團體。同月十六日，全國各地學生代表在上海召開中華全國學生第一屆代表大會，會中產生了「中華民國學生聯合總會」，從一九一九年到一九二八年的十年中，這領導中國學生運動的機構，在反革命的封建殘餘迫害下，曾召開過九屆全國學生代表大會，各地學生均曾積極的參加了反帝反封建的革命斗爭，就以一九二五年的「五卅」運動來看，便是英勇斗爭的范例之一。</p>
<p>在一九二九年十月，國民黨中央訓練部曾勒令「中華民國學生聯合總會」停止活動，直到「九一八」和「一二八」的抗日戰爭開始後，中國的學生運動乃又進入了新的階段，接著爆發了一九三五年的「一二九」運動。</p>
<p>一九三六年春季，另一次全國學生代表大會在上海揭幕，重新成立中國學生聯合會，但實際上就是「中華全國學生第一屆代表大會」，要求發動全面抗日，此後，在一九三八年夏季在武漢開會，主張堅持抗戰到底，反對妥協和投降，以及一九四七年六月在上海展開反饑餓，反內戰運動，相繼舉行了中華全國學生第十二屆和十三屆代表大會，其工作與活動一直在展開中。</p>

<p>本年農產計劃</p>
<p>華北人民政府已公佈華北解放區一九四九年的農業生產計劃。這個計劃，是由華北農業部起草，經華北農林會議研究經過，並經華北人民政府政府委員會審定後公佈的。該計劃的方針是：增產糧食，並保證工業原料的供給。根據此方針，計劃規定今日華北全區要增產糧食七百五十萬石，（前誤為生產糧食一百五十萬擔）即平均每畝增產五市升，增產棉花（皮花）一萬萬三千萬斤，即全年棉花總收獲量增至三萬萬斤，花生，大蔴，等油類作物，則要求達到全年收獲九萬萬三千三百萬斤，為增產棉花及油類作物，計劃規定擴大棉田百分之七十，即全區種棉一千二百萬畝，油類作物中的花生一項計劃稱四百萬畝，因種植棉花及油類作物而減少的部分糧食產量，以多種洋芋，紅薯等多產作物以資補足。為保證全部增產計劃的順利完成，具體辦法如下：（一）解決人力畜力的困難。首先，專廣泛組織勞動互助，動員全區一半以上的婦女全勞動力參加農業主要勞動。其次，要大量增加牲畜。計劃規定要在五臺山區，順山區，霍山區及冀魯豫之朗西區組織群眾繁殖牲畜二十四萬二千頭，並在此基礎上爭取五年內恢復戰　前耕畜數量。（二）大力防治水患，與修水利，開渠，盤井等辦法，擴大水地面積二百萬畝。公區要修復和增加新製水車六萬六千輛，以利發展水利建設。（三）組織農民增加肥料。這是達到增產要求的主要條件之一。在有積肥基礎的地區，今年要作到增加肥料百分之五十較差的地區要增加百分之十五。為增加肥料，各地要普遍組織農民養豬養羊。太行，太岳，北嶽原有羊一百五十萬隻，今年要增加至二百萬隻。（四）各地政府和農場要大力協助農民防除害蟲，推廣優良品種。今年要保證不致發生大規模的蝻災及其他蟲災。為此，計劃規定各地要大量施用土製除蟲藥劑。全華北今年要推廣優良的殺種什麥種，斯字棉，稻種等三十六萬零三千八百畝。（五）全區要幫助農民增加錘，犁，鋤等農具四百一十五萬件，並普遍建立農具修理站，協助農民修農具，並進一步幫助農民改良農具，（六）擴大耕地面積，全區要消減荒地六十萬畝。山區提倡修梯田。冀南，冀魯豫等平原荒蕪地帶並試用拖拉機開墾荒地。此外，計劃規定各地政府發動農民大力造林和發展紡織，運輸，採藥，織蓆，草帽辮等副業生產。</p>
<p>本年造林計劃</p>
<p>華北人民政府農林部製訂今年全華北區造林計劃，該計劃準備在全區植樹二千四百多萬棵。包括建立防風林帶各在荒山砂荒地帶，普遍造林，並準備建立苗圃兩千七百多畝，供給造林需要的樹苗。華北人民政府為了切實完成造林計劃，決定設立領導和管理林業的專門組織，發放林業貸款人民幣一萬萬元。</p>
<p>冀中、冀南、太行等地大量植樹造林。冀中、太行兩行署均組織造林隊分赴各沙荒地區，配合當地黨政領導機關，領導群眾植樹造林，計劃在沙河、永定河沙荒地帶大量培植防風林。冀中新樂縣沿沙河十六個村，在三月四日至十一日的一週中，即植樹九萬株。行唐縣西正村由村長，小學教員等組成護林委員會領導該村的造林與護林工作，在三月五、六兩日即領導植樹三千二百餘株，形成三條防風林帶，該村已作出兩季造林的計劃。冀南區特規定三月十六日至二十二日為植樹運動週，該區元朝（新設縣，大名、朝城各一部）縣七十戶的于家村，今春在沙荒地帶植樹八萬三千株。今年各地植樹一般糾正了過去強調集體植樹，光植樹不保護，追求數量不管成活比例等缺點，而採取自由結成小組，在自己的地上植樹的辦法，因之群眾植樹情緒很高。</p>
<p>發放農業貸款</p>
<p>石家莊市供銷合作總社為鼓勵植棉，特發放植棉貸款人民幣三百三十萬元，並採取貸實還實的方法發放，即貸出種籽與肥料，收回皮棉、籽棉。半月來，該社已購妥花籽十餘萬斤，肥料四十八萬餘斤，不日將經各郊區供銷社開始發放。</p>
<p>山東北海銀行各分行支行，頃決定發放農業貸款貸糧六千九百十六萬餘斤，北海幣十四萬萬元，以扶助農民增產糧食和生產工業原料。北海銀行魯中南分行規定：發放步驟應根據生產季節先發放農具，耕牛貸款，以應春耕需要，次發種籽貸款，最後發放鋤頭及部分種籽等貸款，以解決鋤苗、補苗的困難，該分行並解決通過發放貸款，幫助各地合作社建立信用部，渤海行署亦發出指示，規定貸款首先用以解決推廣種植棉花、花生等之肥料種籽的困難。膠東行署的指示則特別指出發放耕畜貸款時，須視市場來源多寡，掌握貸款數量，以免造成搶購，刺激物價上漲。</p>

<p>案情經過的真實情況，有兩種不同傳說。一是根據官方審訊判決發表：張垠寓藝園，任洪興等則合住駟馬橋畔一茅屋內，咫尺遙望，張經常外出散步，衣冠楚楚，邃為任等所覬誠。在張外出購藥當夕，為任·何卿三人所探悉，遂邀吳大興共同攔路阻擊，當將張耳膜擊破暈倒，搶劫剝取所有衣物　分而散。旋張漸甦醒，因天色昏　，不辨歸途，遙見任等茅屋尚有燈火，即往乞火取暖，卿萬順等聞聲外出，見張甦醒，復以吹火竹筒重擊其頭部，並將其推倒於屋側水溝之旁，張因受重創及奇寒，即倒斃於任等茅屋丈許外之麥田中。經偵輯隊偵訊結果，於任等屋後茅草堆中，搜出張琨衣物，按圖索驥，拿獲任洪興夫婦，幾經鞠詢，始將有關人犯悉數捕獲。另外牽涉出一件桃色案，即劉宅有鸚婢胡桂紅，曾由劉紹禹許字陳俊志，張寓劉宅，與桂紅漸生情好，傳陳深懷妒意，因張慘死非命，陳遂以敎唆殺人罪嫌同入　圄。</p>
<p>千古寬獄：　一幕風　案件　社會傳說如斯</p>
<p>但社會上流傳另一種事實內幕，據說：張理素性風流自賞，劉刁守默年過花信，姿容尚佳，豔婢桂紅小烏依人，風姿楚楚，張寓藝園實不　溫柔鄉，因而放情縱慾，新喪過度，致死原因實為「脫陽」，死後為人利用脫禍嫁罪，在昏夜中昇放任洪興麥田中。任等鄉愚不明利書，剝取張現衣物（或傳張衣物係劉宅潛儂任茅屋後者），殆任等被逮後，劉宅又以水田廿畝購買卿萬順，咬定與任等通謀，其間謀斃張琨（卿於卅四年十月廿四日庾斃獄中，臨死時說出此原委）。　陳俊志則在蓉羣策宇號經商，素為劉紹禹所賞識，遂以桂紅許字，誘稱為　義女，但陳後探悉桂紅實為婢女，復悉與張有　　情事，毅然拒絕，彈琨死，因劉及胡　陳拒婚，故線罪指陳教唆殺人。這事實是幾年來在成都街談巷無處輟紙雜誌都一致認定的內幕真正情形，祉會上尤繪聲繪色，確切指證，並不滿法院判決，認為是千古空前大冤獄。川省參會特為申援請有關機關調查，而這一千判刑「兇犯」更得到全川社會普邊同情，法院也曾檢驗桂紅尚為處子，終以「莫須有」</p>
<p>這一件空前奇案，從地院高院而最高法院，歷時三年又六月，主犯卿萬順卅四年冬廈斃獄中，吳大與，任洪與，何占春於卅五年十一月二十八日更審後判各處有期徒刑十年，陳曉帆，曹瑞平無罪。直到去年七月廿七日再更審任王氏，陳俊志部份，結果宣判任王氏減處有期徒刑四年，陳俊志無罪，這一件轟傳全國的大案便作一正式了結。</p>
<p>市民聚觀人民解放軍約法八則（本報攝）</p>
<h3 id="c69">從市集說到地攤 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「上海灘」，看到在未解放以前幾天街頭的情形，應該解釋作為「上海攤」，那是一種最原始的交易方式，也走日前看到的街頭景象。自從昨晟解放軍進入市區，人心安定，但商店惟恐金圓券貶值，故相率停市，地攤亦就暫時絕跡。但各商店遵安全委員會的決議，今日將照常營業，相信各馬路兩旁的地攤，亦將重形熱鬧。茲姑將地攤的沿革史，錄之於後，以饗讀者：</p>
<p>日中為市，是上古時期的交易方式，上海當然是不會例外的。從上海的文獻中，找不到市集方式交易的記載；但這種原始的交易，卻有一些痕跡遺留下來，靜安寺附近浴佛節的劇會，還具有市集的形式。</p>
<p>一年一度的浴佛節　靜安寺畔攤販林立</p>
<p>靜安寺，在上海的廟宇中，也算是名剎之一，在歷史上說，也有許多值得研究的價值。農歷四月初八的浴佛節，靜安寺照例有一年一度的盛會，香火鼎逐，遊人如織。在這熱鬧的場合，許多乘機來趕賣買的商販，在廟之附近，攤販林立，做香客遊人們的交易，雖然是零星的日用品，但人多攤多，交易的總數也不小呢！租界的開闢和擴展，平坦的柏油路，從外灘延長到靜安寺，靜安寺的交通更便捷了。雖然南京路和靜安寺路，商店　比，但一年一度的浴佛節盛會，並沒有減退。</p>
<p>靜安寺的廟會，從四月初開始，到初十以後，是集市的會期。從赫德路開始，沿着靜安寺路，延長到地體路以西。極司非爾路和海格路上，北到新閘路，南到福煦路，廟後的愚園路，　州路，也是攤基的地方。蘆席棚，布帳，張得密密層層，遮住那初夏的太陽，攤上出售的貨品，有木器，藤恭，竹器，陶器，鋼鐵　等，大都是手工的製品。校精細的刺繡，織綿，細竹等件，也有陳列着。新式的機製品，也有出售，像布疋，襪子，化裝品等，但品質上是不及商店裏的。在空場上，還有變戲法，奇人奇獣，西洋鏡等玩藝兒，飄着旗幡，敲著鐵鍋，在招攬主顧。</p>
<p>租界時代特殊區域　陳列舊貨形形色色</p>
<p>原始的市集，都和廟宇聯在一起，靜安寺的廟會，祗是一年一度，城隍廟裏，卻終年的攏着許多攤販。現在廟裏的許多小店舖，就是攤基的發展。假手飾，玩具，小孩鞋帽，花草·文玩·骨董等，而吃食攤獨多，魷魚，雞鴨血，南翔饅頭，酒釀圓子，都是很著名的。此外算命。賣卜者流，也是廟會中不可少的點綴，城隍廟也獨多，城隍廟雖經常的有市集，但逢到節期，更　得熱　，　熱鬧的一天，是除夕的半夜。善男信女們搶著來燒頭香，糜肩接踵，途為之塞。小吃攤，香燭店的營業特盛，命相的生意也很熟鬧，那許多人多要問間來年的命運。</p>
<p>在租界時代，馬路上是不准任意設攤的，但攤販仍有，普通是在里街的門樓下·也有在馬路上公然設攤的，那是特殊的地區，出售的也是特殊的商品，關北的海昌路，前法租界的平濟利路等，就是那攤販集中的地方。那裏的東西，衣服，帽子面盆，鍋子，五金用具，自鳴鐘，傢具，形形式式都有，祇是舊的罷了。這許多東西，有的是有錢人家用舊了遺棄的，也有來路不明的。兩旁還有破布店，雜貨舖，茶館，路上的人，有挑著擔子，有狹若包袱，有提著箱子，都是來趕市的。因為是舊貨，主顧也限於貧民階級。假使有目光，在那裏準可以買到便宜貨，但不識貨的，買得會比新的貴，有時還會買到滑頭貨。在普安路上，還有許多江湖賣藝之流參加著。測字算命的，張大涼傘的牙醫生，唱小曲，說書的藝人，把這市集點綴得更熱鬧。</p>
<p>外匯限制美貨價昂　黃金時代逐漸過去</p>
<p>近來的攤販，要推勝利以後虬江路的地攤了，一般要塌便宜貨的人，都往那裏跑，被戰火燒過了的廢墟上，頓成為熟鬧的市集。當勝利的爆竹，驚醒了日本人侵略的迷夢，日僑紛紛出賣了他們的傢具，用器，衣着，準備遺送回國。傢具都是很小的，在寸金地的上海，倒很合用。茶具·酒器·精細的小擺設，都是很有趣的。最引人注意的，那她日本女人背上的彩帶，五色繽紛，絢爛奪目，還有一條條的包袱</p>
<p>繼虬江路而起的，是美貨市場了。從珍珠港事變起，到勝利為止，上海沒有美貨到來，已是四個年頭了。勝利後美貨源源而來，覺得格外地親切，好像久別的情人，重又會見一樣。美貨市傷的中心在朱葆三路，出售的以軍用剩餘物資為大宗，也有正式商人進口的貨物，但也有美軍或軍艦私自出售的後門貨。那時美國貨便宜極了，幾乎每一個人都有一二件美式配備，玻璃褲帶，太陽眼鏡，克寗奶粉，吉士香煙，都成了最普遍的用品。美貨的集中地雖在朱葆三路，但攤販卻遍及全市，不論熱鬧或冷僻的馬路上，都有攤販的蹤跡，這時即因攤販被禁沿路擺設，曾引起了一場軒然大波。以後攤販們轉移地位，改設聯合商場，但他的黃金時代巳過去了。漸漸地因外匯限制，美貨售價日高，再也沒有盛大的銷路。</p>
<p>急於求現　街頭出賣</p>
<p>最近地攤又重在上海街頭出現，情形看來還很熱鬧，可是和過去美貨攤販相比，已不可以並諭了。這次地攤的產生，大都因工廠銷路阻塞，經濟周轉不靈，解散又拿不出那筆遺散費，於是將商品發給職工，職工為了生活，拿到的貨品，急以兌現，就擺在街頭出賣。許多商店本來營業很清淡，也乘這皺會，分一點貨品，呌夥計們擺個地攤。地攤上多是輕工業品，手巾，被單，意料，鍋子，熱水瓶，貨價也便宜得緊，可是交易卻很清淡，雖然攤子園着不少的人，但真正的買主卻是寥寥，這許多地攤的出現，也就始表示工商業凋敝。</p>
<h3 id="c70">新民主經濟制度下　民營銀行仍有出路　協助國家銀行發展生產 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民營銀行在新民主主義經濟制度的社會裏，是否有它的出路？記者曾訪問幾位較瞭解新民主主義經濟的銀行家，據談：「在新的經濟制度中，民營銀行是有出路的，這條路並不是走幫助投機商人，高抬物價，剝削人民的路，乃是幫助生產，充裕社會財富，讓大家有吃有穿的路。這條路是健康的，容易走的，因為前面有國家銀行在領路，國家銀行的業務是幫助國營或較大規模的企業，民營銀行力量較小，則可以幫助小規模甚或手工業的生產者。換句話說，就是民營銀行可以協助國家銀行去扶植國家銀行無暇顧及的生產機構和生產者。站在這個原則上，民營銀行對於貨戶，應當時時檢查其所貸款項，他否真正用於生產上，並須澈底防止走向商業投機之路。量初在吸收存款上，也許發生困難，但在幫助生產者增加生產後，瓦相聞定能建立一正常的密切往來關係，發展生產，繁榮經濟，不再會發生過去的壞作用」云。</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Eight-Point Code of the People's Liberation Army <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Proclamation of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:</p>
<p>The Kuomintang reactionaries have refused to accept the peace terms and persist in their criminal war against the nation and the people. The people of the whole country hope that the People's Liberation Army will quickly eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries. We have ordered the People's Liberation Army to bravely advance, eliminate all Kuomintang reactionary troops who dare to resist, arrest all war criminals who are incorrigible, liberate the people of the whole country, and guarantee the independence and integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, truly realizing the genuine peace, democracy, and unity desired by the people of the whole country. Wherever the People's Liberation Army arrives, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide assistance. The following eight-point code is hereby proclaimed, and we hope that all our people will abide by it together.</p>
<p>(1) Protect the lives and property of all the people. People from all walks of life, regardless of class, belief, or occupation, are expected to maintain order and adopt a cooperative attitude with the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army will adopt a cooperative attitude with people from all walks of life. Counter-revolutionaries or other saboteurs who take the opportunity to cause trouble, rob, or destroy will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(2) Protect national industry, commerce, agriculture, and animal husbandry. Factories, shops, banks, warehouses, ships, wharves, farms, pastures, etc., privately operated are all protected and not to be infringed upon. It is hoped that employees in all industries will continue production as usual, and shops will continue business as usual.</p>
<p>(3) Confiscate bureaucratic capital. Factories, shops, banks, warehouses, ships, wharves, railways, post offices, telegraphs, telephones, waterworks, farms, pastures, etc., operated by the Kuomintang reactionary government and major bureaucrats will all be taken over by the People's Government. If there are private shares of national industrialists, merchants, farmers, and herdsmen in them, their ownership will be recognized after investigation. All personnel working in bureaucratic capital enterprises must continue to work as before until the People's Government takes over, and be responsible for protecting assets, machinery, charts, books, files, etc., pending inventory and takeover. Those who have made meritorious contributions to protection will be rewarded, and those who slacken off and sabotage will be punished. Those who wish to continue to serve will be allowed to be employed according to their talents after the People's Government takes over, so that they will not be displaced.</p>
<p>(4) Protect all public and private schools, academies, cultural and educational institutions, sports venues, and all other public welfare undertakings. All personnel working in these institutions are expected to continue to work as usual. The People's Liberation Army will protect them all and they shall not be infringed upon.</p>
<p>(5) Except for incorrigible war criminals and counter-revolutionaries with heinous crimes, all officials of the Kuomintang central, provincial, municipal, and county governments, representatives to the National Assembly, members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, senators, police personnel, and heads of districts, towns, townships, and baojia who do not resist with arms or conspire to sabotage will not be taken as prisoners, arrested, or insulted by the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government. The above-mentioned personnel are ordered to remain at their posts, obey the orders of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government, and be responsible for protecting the assets and files of various institutions, pending takeover and disposal. Those among these personnel who have special skills and no serious reactionary behavior or serious malfeasance will be allowed to be employed by the People's Government on a case-by-case basis. Those who take the opportunity to sabotage, steal, embezzle, carry public funds, public property, or public cases and flee, or refuse to hand over, will be held accountable.</p>
<p>(6) In order to ensure urban and rural security and stabilize social order, all scattered soldiers and bandits should surrender and report to the local People's Liberation Army or the People's Government. Those who voluntarily surrender and report and hand over all their weapons will not be prosecuted. Those who refuse to report or conceal weapons will be arrested and investigated with the enthusiastic participation of the people. Those who harbor without reporting will also be subject to appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>(7) The feudal land ownership system in the countryside is unreasonable and should be abolished. However, the abolition of this system must be prepared and carried out step by step. Generally speaking, rent and interest reduction should be carried out first, followed by land distribution, and it will only be possible to seriously solve the land problem after the People's Liberation Army arrives and works for a considerable period. The peasant masses should be organized to assist the People's Liberation Army in carrying out various initial reforms, while striving to cultivate and ensure that the existing level of industrial production is not reduced, and then gradually improve it, in order to improve the lives of peasants and provide the urban people with commercial grain. Urban land and housing cannot be handled in the same way as rural land problems.</p>
<p>(8) Protect the safety of the lives and property of foreign nationals. It is hoped that all foreign nationals must abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government, must not engage in espionage activities, must not engage in activities that oppose the cause of national independence and people's liberation of China, and must not harbor Chinese war criminals, counter-revolutionaries, and other criminals; otherwise, they will be subject to the legal sanctions of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government.</p>
<p>The People's Liberation Army is strict in discipline, buys and sells fairly, and is not allowed to take a needle or thread from the people. It is hoped that all our people will live and work in peace, and do not easily believe rumors and frighten each other. This is especially announced.</p>

<p>(Broadcast from Beiping Xinhua Radio Station) Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 24th Dispatch: After a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army entered Qigong Town, Yiyang County, eastern Jiangxi, the hometown of revolutionary martyr Comrade Fang Zhimin, the commanders and fighters went to Hutang Village, the birthplace of the martyr, to pay their respects, and to express their condolences to the martyr's family and the local people. Comrade Fang Zhimin was one of the founders of the Chinese Red Army. In just two years, he developed from three rifles into the Tenth Army of the Red Army, controlling a vast area on the border of Fujian, Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. In 1934, Comrade Fang Zhimin led the Chinese Red Army Anti-Japanese Advance Team northward to resist Japan. Chiang Kai-shek, who insisted on selling out the country and carrying out civil war, used seven times the force to encircle and attack. Comrade Fang Zhimin was unfortunately captured during the breakout. In July 1935, he was murdered by Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang. Now the unit has dispatched special personnel to carry comfort supplies to comfort the martyr's family, and to collect the martyr's heroic deeds to carry out education in the troops.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Order to "Punish War Criminals" <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Since our People's Liberation Army turned to the offensive, it has been invincible and nationwide victory is just around the corner. The Kuomintang reactionaries are facing the fate of being wiped out, and have recently become inhumane, releasing poison gas, massacring people, destroying buildings, and destroying materials, making desperate and arrogant destruction. All of our army, from top to bottom, must work harder and take all effective measures to protect the lives and property of the country and the people, so that they will not be damaged or destroyed by the Kuomintang army, and those who are the primary instigators of evil must be thoroughly investigated and severely punished. To this end, in accordance with the spirit of our army's Double Tenth Declaration of 1947, the following orders are announced:</p>
<p>First, all Kuomintang military officers, party departments, and government officials at all levels who order their subordinates to carry out the following crimes and the evidence is conclusive shall be convicted as war criminals:</p>
<p>(1) Slaughtering the people, plundering the people's property, or burning down the people's houses;</p>
<p>(2) Releasing poison gas;</p>
<p>(3) Killing prisoners;</p>
<p>(4) Destroying weapons and ammunition;</p>
<p>(5) Destroying communication equipment and burning all documents and files;</p>
<p>(6) Destroying food, clothing, warehouses, and other military equipment;</p>
<p>(7) Destroying all means of land, sea, and air transportation;</p>
<p>(8) Destroying bank vaults;</p>
<p>(9) Destroying municipal water and electricity facilities, factory buildings, and various machinery;</p>
<p>(10) Destroying cultural relics;</p>
<p>(11) Burning all public property and public goods;</p>
<p>(12) Air raids and bombings on the people in the liberated areas.</p>
<p>Second, all those who take the lead in implementing one of the above behaviors shall be punished according to law.</p>
<p>Third, those who take effective measures, thereby ensuring that the lives and property of the people and all the spoils of war and urban construction belonging to our army are completely protected from destruction, shall be given due rewards. The People's Liberation Army in all localities should earnestly implement this order. Our army's policy towards the Kuomintang reactionary party, government, and military personnel is: "The leader must be punished, the coerced will not be questioned, and the meritorious will be rewarded." War criminals must be pursued, and the leaders must be held accountable. They must be pursued to the ends of the earth, and they must be brought to justice and not allowed to escape. This is especially ordered.</p>

<p>(Broadcast from Beiping Xinhua Radio Station) Shanghai Front, 24th Dispatch: The vanguard of the Liberation Army advancing towards Shanghai along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway fiercely pursued the fleeing Kuomintang bandit army and rescued bridges in various places. On the 12th, with the help of employees along the way, the unit quickly erected five pontoon bridges between Jiaxing and Songjiang. At dawn on the 13th, the unit rushed to the Dadongyan Iron Bridge, thirteen li west of Songjiang City. At that time, the Kuomintang bandit army fleeing north had already planted explosives on the bridge in preparation for detonating it. The unit immediately dispatched two squads, braving the enemy's intensive fire, to rush onto the bridge. They immediately captured the enemy's position on the southern end of the iron bridge, and then used another squad to continue the attack. In ten minutes, they rushed across the iron bridge, which was more than one hundred feet long, and occupied the bridgehead on the north bank, finally preserving this large iron bridge. The commander of a certain corps specially issued a commendation to the company.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Hong Kong, 24th Dispatch) According to the three pilots of the China National Aviation Corporation who arrived here on the last batch of planes from Shanghai, naval ships of the Kuomintang government are currently gathering outside the mouth of the Wusong River. The three pilots were also stationed at Jiangwan Airport, assisting in the evacuation of senior officials there. According to chief pilot Mr. Ma, he believes that Chen Daqing and Chen Liang were among these senior officials. He said that he was detained at Jiangwan Airport, and his superiors threatened him with the death penalty if he attempted to fly away without orders.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) According to a telegram received by a certain foreign firm from a ship in Andong, "The Andong Foreign Trade Bureau has been reorganized and renamed the Ministry of Commerce." The telegram did not detail the actual situation after the reorganization, but predicted that Andong's foreign trade would be smoother and promote the development of foreign trade due to the reorganization and consolidation.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) According to a telegram received by a certain trading company from a cargo ship that left Shanghai last month and has now safely arrived in Andong, after arriving at the port, the goods were unloaded smoothly. Because the weather there is warming up, transportation is much more convenient than before. Also, the concentration of materials is more convenient than before due to the more convenient inland transportation. Furthermore, due to the adjustment of Andong's trade management agencies, the barter standards and barter procedures are more convenient than before. The telegram is full of optimism, and relevant parties expect that Hong Kong's trade with Andong will proceed along a reasonable and steady path from now on.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Guangzhou, 24th Dispatch) On Monday, the exchange rate between the Gold Yuan Coupon and the US dollar here has risen to 240 million yuan for one US dollar. This rate of devaluation has made it impossible for the Kuomintang's funds to be maintained. Most of these transactions are conducted in Hong Kong as the main area. It is said that the Kuomintang government has also sent people to Hong Kong to buy US dollars, while stores price goods in Hong Kong dollars. People in the transportation industry in Hong Kong say that a large amount of Gold Yuan Coupons has recently been transported from Shanghai to here. In fact, the Gold Yuan Coupon in Guangzhou has almost become waste paper.</p>

<h3 id="e16">North China People's Government Allows Foreign Merchants to Trade; Hong Kong Merchants Are Confident that the Volume of Trade in the North Can Increase <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) The North China People's Government has allowed foreign merchants to engage in trade. According to the Far Eastern Economic Review, since Hong Kong has dispelled the immature and incorrect understanding of the attitude and procedures of the Chinese Communist authorities in North China and Northeast China regarding trade, normal commercial relations between Hong Kong and North China have begun. Merchant ships and merchants of any nationality are very eager to restore the very profitable trade with North China. After a short period of hesitation, American merchants and transportation companies are also actively trading with the CCP. Naturally, the majority of trade between Hong Kong and North China is still conducted by Chinese. When trading with North China, although regulations such as import and export trade and maritime transportation must be observed, other aspects clearly imply that the CCP authorities are eager to develop trade. Before the financial chaos in the whole of China is replaced by a new order, bulk trade must still be based on barter. For this year, local merchants are confident that they can increase the volume of trade with North China and Northeast China. For the benefit of the Chinese people and global commerce, transportation, aviation, telecommunications, banking, and insurance industries, it is necessary to quickly establish and regulate. According to a certain authority in the trade sector, based on the information obtained from various sources, rent-seeking and speculation are not desirable, but there is always a profit that is better than other trade routes. It is a bias for a small number of merchants to expect high profits. As far as we know, every ship to North China will not lose money, but the actual net profit will vary, and the materials in different regions will be good or bad. The goods shipped from Hong Kong to the liberated areas in the past may not have been needed by the liberated areas, so the profit may be thin. Some of the exchanged materials are not liked by merchants, so we can know that the trade between Hong Kong and North China, including Tianjin, will definitely gradually improve and become Hong Kong's normal trade.</p>
<p>Currently, a small number of trading companies in Hong Kong that are engaged in business with the liberated areas seem to be emotionally low, which is due to their excessively high expectations. Because the trade bureaus in the ports of the liberated areas stipulate that the gross profit should be more than 40%, even if the freight is high because everyone in Hong Kong wants to get high-value and marketable materials, they will inevitably be unhappy when they get materials that they do not like. To anticipate this phenomenon, it is necessary to study the supply and demand relationship between the two sides in advance. The recent telegrams reported that the Tianjin Trade Bureau signed barter contracts with merchants, so the future trade between Hong Kong and Tianjin can proceed along a more rational path. Therefore, the current and future trade situation will definitely be improved better. The only important thing is that those who do business with the liberated areas in Hong Kong should not hope to obtain high profits, because trading with the liberated areas is also a contribution, and one should never hope to get rich overnight.</p>

<p>[New China News Agency, Beiping, 25th] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in protest against the Indian reactionary government's persecution of democrats and trade union personnel, issued the following statement today: According to telegrams from Delhi, the Indian government has recently carried out cruel persecution and massacres of Indian trade union leaders, communists, and democrats in Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Bombay, Delhi, and other places. We express our utmost indignation at these brutal acts and lodge a strong protest. We believe that these brutal acts by the Indian reactionary government are a direct violation of the Indian people's interests in obtaining genuine independence, democracy, and freedom. This is a crime that cannot be forgiven by any democratic and free people or the working people of the world and will inevitably be met with even more violent resistance from the entire Indian people. Here, we extend our deepest condolences and sympathy to all the working-class brothers and democrats in India who have been massacred and persecuted. We believe that your struggle for independence, democracy, and freedom, with the firm support of peace-loving people around the world, will surely achieve a brilliant victory throughout India.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Developing Nenjiang's Industrial Achievements <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Northeast News] Since the Northeast Nenjiang Province-operated industries conference in July last year, the general production of each factory has embarked on the right track after the three major policies of developing manufacturing, restricting textiles, and reducing and merging grain processing industries, as well as unified management and reasonable adjustments, and great achievements have been made in the past six months.</p>
<p>First, the entire province's industries were unified, and a total of 123 factories and workshops were taken over, with a total capital value of 13,572,565,518 yuan. Among them, there were 61 grain and rice processing industries, with a total capital value of 7,169,434,378 yuan, accounting for 52.4%. After the merger, there were 39. There were originally 11 textile industries in the province, and after the merger, each city only had three, and Fuyu and Anda had one each, totaling five. The leadership can also concentrate its efforts on management. In the past six months, 11 places including glass factories, pharmaceutical factories, winery factories, match factories, breweries (four places), and the flax factory attached to the Nenjiang Textile Factory, and the blood cake factory attached to the leather factory have been built successively. Except for the factory, which will not be completed until March next year, all other factories have started production one after another.</p>
<p>At present, there are 92 factories in the province, with a total capital of 59,979,775,045 yuan. Among them, there are 39 grain processing industries, with a capital of 28,573,586,500 yuan, accounting for 47.85%, 5 textile industries, with a capital of 9,983,082,733 yuan, accounting for 6.59%, and other industries with a total capital of 21,423,105,812 yuan, accounting for 35.56%. Although the grain processing industry has declined, it still accounts for the largest proportion.</p>
<p>In the past six months, the production situation of each province-operated factory, except for the Sanhe Jianhuo Mill, has generally been normal. The Leather Factory completed 101.36% of the production plan, the Nenjiang Textile Factory completed 101.48% of the spinning, the Xinhua Textile Factory completed 109.7%, the Limin Weaving Factory completed 113.63%, the two distilleries completed 112-115%, and the Match Factory completed 108.06%. The Nenjiang and Xinhua Textile Factories reduced weaving due to the high price of yarn and the low price of cloth, completing only 85.57% and 75.61% respectively. The Nenjiang Pharmaceutical Factory and others have not completed the production tasks because their initial construction and production have not yet become regularized. After the unification of the factories, because the capital figures of the factories were mostly inconsistent with reality, a warehouse cleanup was implemented to determine each factory, which ended at the end of September. The completion of this work changed the awareness of all employees about people's property, strengthened the responsibilities of the storage organization and the custodians, improved storage methods, improved work efficiency, disposed of unnecessary materials, improved warehouse equipment, and universally established a warehouse system. The main finished products produced in the past year are: cloth—3,133 bolts, foreign yarn 87,135 catties, matches 72,400 boxes, flour 8,344,929 catties, liquor 709,719 catties, and other sorghum rice, soybean oil, medicines, glass, etc. Calculated at an average estimated value, it is worth approximately 68,346,105,337 yuan (by-products not included). If calculated based on 8,433 employees, the average per capita production value (including cost) is 47,694,421 yuan, equivalent to 17 tons of sorghum rice. If calculated based on a net profit of 17.5 billion, then each person added about 8,740 catties of sorghum rice to the society, which is about five times the production of farmers.</p>
<p>In the past six months, the province's industries have made a total profit of 20,483,641,985 yuan, of which 61.5% was paid for tasks and 38.49% was retained by the factory for expanded reproduction.</p>
<p>In the past six months of production, some experiences and achievements have been created in improving technology and saving raw materials. Comrade Yu Kainan of the Research Office and Comrade Yu Shengzao of the Leather Factory successfully researched and manufactured blood cake from pine bark. Each catty of pine bark produces 1.8 to 2 taels of blood cake, with a daily output of 54 catties. The pharmaceutical factory used honey to make glucose and clam shells to make calcium chloride under extremely difficult conditions of tools and equipment, and improved the manufacture of injectable drugs, etc. All factories with normal production have increased their output. The number of matches increased from 457 boxes in July to 1,165 boxes in October, an increase of 262.1%, with a daily increase of 87.2%. The average output per spindle of spinning at the Nenjiang Textile Factory increased from 3.05 taels in August to 3.86 taels in November; the output of cloth per machine increased from 34.8 yards in July to 39.6 yards in November; while the spinning reached 0.3% of the standard output (4 taels), and the weaving reached 79.9% of the standard output (48 taels). The weaving rate increased from 97% in August to 99.1% in October, while the weight loss rate decreased from 2.3% to 0.85%. The shoe factory now saves 2 inches of leather compared to the past when making a pair of leather shoes; the glass factory saves 820 catties of coal per day. In addition, in order to reduce expenses, each factory also has a plan to streamline non-production personnel. At present, management personnel only account for 14.5% of the total number of employees in each factory. In the process of developing and rectifying the province-operated industries in the past six months, the following points of experience were gained: (1) It is very necessary to uniformly reorganize and strengthen the leadership of concentrated funds due to the blindness and lack of planning in industrial production in the past. However, if the province manages the industry uniformly, it will not only lose sight of one another but also reduce the classic interest of each county in managing the industry. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly divide the work between the province and the county, and under the unified leadership of the province's industrial production, decentralize management. (2) Only by reducing the remaining industries can funds be drawn to build new factories. The funds for the grass bag factory in Anda and Zhaodong, and the timber exploration company in Nenjiang were solved in this way. (3) The construction of new factories should have a relatively detailed plan. A new factory cannot be completed in a very short time. The proficiency of workers' skills, the difficulty of equipment, the normal source of raw materials, and the opening of sales markets all require considerable time. It should not be rushed to success, and long-term plans must be made to overcome all difficulties and obtain favorable development.</p>
<p>Our province has abundant conditions for developing sideline occupations. Some local products are not only unique in the entire Northeast, but even famous at home and abroad, and have great development prospects. Long-term plans should be made. The most promising sideline occupations in our province are animal husbandry, fish, and meat. Secondly, city saltpeter and yangcao reeds are famous specialties in the entire Northeast, with extremely abundant yields. The weaving industry has developed greatly in the past one or two years. In addition, various fine hides, medicinal materials, mountain goods, etc. also have considerable output. After analyzing the province's sideline occupation situation, he emphasized that the commercial sector in the past did not have a sufficient understanding of the important task of assisting sideline occupations in solving sales, and its contribution was extremely poor. In the future, it must regard assisting sideline occupation production and agricultural production as equally important, and actively and proactively find sales channels for various local products. He also clearly pointed out that various local products purchased by the state and transferred by the province and county are the focus of the province and county commercial departments' sideline occupation promotion this spring. He also called on comrades from various counties to go back and conduct detailed investigations and studies on sideline occupation production in their respective counties. Based on possible sales channels, a plan for the transfer of local products in the county should be made and reported to the province within a time limit.</p>

<p>...New China News Agency, North China News: The famous straw hat industry in Shangjialin, Xian County, Hebei, has moved from decline to recovery with the support of the People's Government. Shangjialin is a town with more than 800 households. It has been engaged in the straw hat industry for more than 80 years. In its heyday, there were 85 straw hat factories, 210 machines, and more than 600 workers. It could weave 840 dozen straw hats every day, and its products were sold in coastal cities. Farmers in several nearby counties all regarded weaving straw hat braids as one of the main sideline occupations. The women who participated in this production alone once reached 50,000. After the "July 7th" Incident, most of the machines were destroyed by the Japanese invaders, and the Shangjialin straw hat industry almost completely collapsed. Last winter, the Xian County Production Promotion Agency established a branch in the town to specialize in leading the restoration. Four mass cooperative straw hat factories have now been organized, with 787 households as shareholders. A total of 46 machines have been started, and 196 dozen straw hats are produced daily. The gradual recovery of the straw hat industry has greatly benefited the town and nearby farmers.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Vyshinsky Clarifies Position: Demands Participation in Ruhr Control; German Affairs Still Under Joint Control of Four Powers; Foreign Ministers' Conference Proceeds in Calm and Friendly Atmosphere <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 24th) The Western three powers' foreign ministers today rejected Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's proposal that the four powers jointly manage Germany in accordance with the "Potsdam Agreement." Vyshinsky made his first speech at today's meeting and demanded participation in the control of the Ruhr industrial area. The meeting proceeded in a calm and friendly atmosphere. The current Ruhr management organization is composed of six countries: Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Foreign Minister Schuman said: If the old four-power joint management organization is restored, the previous mistakes will inevitably be repeated. US Secretary of State Acheson said: Returning to the old organization of the Potsdam era would be tantamount to calling a newly healed patient who has regained the function of three limbs back to its original state. British Foreign Secretary Bevin emphasized that the Western powers have established a free and democratic government in West Germany and do not intend to abandon this achievement now. Vyshinsky delivered a long speech condemning the Western powers for violating the Potsdam Agreement and attempting to split Germany. The original text of Vyshinsky's proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>"(1) In order to achieve Germany's economic and political unification, (a) restore the German Control Council as the institution exercising supreme power in Germany. (b) Restore the Four-Power Joint Staff in Berlin to unify the administration of the entire city of Berlin and ensure the normal life of the citizens of Berlin. (2) In view of the difficulty in achieving Germany's economic and political unification before the establishment of a German central government, it is necessary to recognize the following two points as necessary measures: (a) establish a German Political Committee for the whole of Germany based on the existing German economic institutions in the East and West Zones. (b) Restore the municipal institutions of the whole of Berlin. The date for the election of the municipal institutions of the whole of Berlin shall be considered and decided by the Four-Power Joint Staff in Berlin." Vyshinsky said that the best way for international control is to establish an institution of strong representation, and countries neighboring Germany should be allowed to send representatives to attend the meetings in a consultative capacity, and German economic groups should also be allowed to send representatives. The four foreign ministers discussed the issue of German unification for about three hours today. Vyshinsky left the meeting first.

<h3 id="e25">Bonn Constitution Splits Germany: German Communist Party Representatives Refuse to Sign <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[New China News Agency, Beiping, 25th] The divisive "constitution" manufactured single-handedly by the US-British-French bloc was declared effective on the 23rd at the last meeting of the Bonn Constituent Assembly.</p>
<p>Various left-wing parties, including the Christian Social Union, the German Party, and many deputies who previously opposed the Bonn "Constitution," have signed the Bonn "Constitution" under the direction of the United States and Britain, but West German Communist Party representatives Zeng Mann and Lenner both refused to sign.</p>
<p>Lenner declared, "I will never sign for the division of Germany." The Constituent Assembly was dissolved after the Bonn "Constitution" was signed and declared effective by the governors of the West German states. The West German Constituent Assembly was established last year by the US-British-French occupying authorities based on the first London Six-Power (including the US-British-French-Dutch-Belgian-Luxembourg) conference in June last year. It included 65 political leaders from all sides, most of whom were reactionaries. Its purpose was to formulate a "constitution" that would split Germany, dismember Germany, and reduce Germany to a US colony. The characteristic of the Bonn "Constitution" is that it stipulates that West Germany is a "Federal Republic," and gives the main powers to the divided states, while the central government only has secondary powers, so as to facilitate US rule. The Bonn "Constitution" has clauses that clearly sell out German sovereignty, stipulating that some sovereignty can be abandoned to participate in the United States of Europe and other international organizations. The Bonn "Constitution" also does not conceal its fascist nature, stipulating that the government may declare parties that "attack democratic freedom" to be illegal, actually guaranteeing the reactionary government's suppression of the people's freedom. In addition, the Bonn "Constitution" stipulates that the West German parliament is bicameral, with upper house members elected by the state governments and lower house members elected, with a total of 400 members, serving a term of four years. The president is elected by a joint session of both houses, and the premier is elected by the lower house.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] State Department News Director White stated today that the authorities are studying plans to enable Japan to have a more adequate police force, but there is absolutely no intention to allow it to rebuild any international military force.

Foreign reports that US officials are actively studying the reconstruction of the Japanese Ministry of Defense are contrary to Japan's post-war constitution and the policies decided by the Far Eastern Commission. The State Department issued the above statement to deny it.</p>

<p>US Newspapers Reveal His Background</p>
<p>[Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 25th dispatch] New York: The Southern Needle Daily published a dispatch from its Washington correspondent, Stone, stating that the appointment of McCloy as the US High Commissioner to Germany represents a victory for the Rockefeller Company and Standard Oil. Stone wrote: The appointment of Black to succeed McCloy as President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is another victory for Standard Oil. The law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hope &amp; Hadley, which McCloy belonged to, is the legal advisor to Chase Bank. Stone stated that Chase Bank is the Wall Street branch of the Standard Oil Trust. Stone recalled that Black was the First Vice President of Chase Bank, which was the main financial agent of the Hitler regime and the financial pillar of the oil consortium linked to Farben Industries (Germany's largest chemical industry monopoly). Stone also said that the dismissal of Kollison, Deputy Minister of the Decartelization Department, and the earlier dismissal of another member of the Decartelization Department, Sachs (both of whom had exposed the American authorities' obstruction of decartelization work), as well as McCloy's appointment this time, indicate that the power of the cartels has been strengthened. Stone asserted that Chase Bank has close ties with German industry, and the authorities of Chase Bank "never lost contact" with Hitler's Germany.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Trieste Free Territory Election Not Free <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 25th dispatch] TASS, Rome: Municipal elections will be held in the Anglo-American occupied zone of the Free Territory of Trieste. The city of Trieste will hold elections on June 12, and five cities including Muggia will hold elections on June 19. From the very beginning of the campaign, representatives of the Communist Party and democratic organizations of the Free Territory of Trieste have revealed at mass meetings the conditions created by the Anglo-American occupation authorities that make genuine elections impossible. The occupation authorities fully support fascist instigation groups, and the persecution of progressive elements continues to occur. In order to "maintain law and order" during the elections, the Anglo-American occupation authorities have prepared a police force of 17,000 people, including 7,000 American and British military police, which means that there is one policeman for every twenty people. The Anglo-American authorities have arbitrarily removed about 2,000 people from the voter lists, many of whom are guerrillas and anti-fascists, on the grounds that these people had been sentenced to imprisonment by the fascist (special tribunals) in the past. The Anglo-American authorities obstruct the election campaign, prohibiting Communist organizations from holding meetings. At the same time, the Anglo-American authorities violate the treaty, including thousands of people who returned to Trieste after June 10, 1940, on the voter lists. To encourage the fascist propaganda of the "Italian Social Movement" faction and other reactionary groups in Trieste, the Anglo-American authorities first conducted a series of trials of former guerrillas in the area, and even during the election campaign, they continued to arrest former guerrillas and illegally search the residences of progressive groups. The military authorities also encouraged fascists to make public speeches against Communist representatives. According to the Rome Solidarity newspaper, the Communist Party of the Free Territory of Trieste and several democratic mass organizations issued a special statement denouncing the tyranny of the Anglo-American authorities and notified the United Nations Secretariat of the election policies implemented by the Anglo-Americans in the Free Territory of Trieste. The Free Territory of Trieste is located on the northern shore of the Adriatic Sea between Italy and Yugoslavia, and was established based on an agreement of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Currently, troops from the United States, Britain, and Yugoslavia are still stationed in the Free Territory.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Profile of Katharine Cornell, Famous American Actress <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Katharine Cornell completed her performance of Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" in May 1948, thus fulfilling her wish. Because, this outstanding American actress, her life's greatest hope was to play the Egyptian queen, and she believes that this Egyptian queen is the most complete woman under Shakespeare's pen. Her performance of this play also broke all records, because the play was performed for two hundred and fifty-one consecutive performances.</p>
<p>Cleopatra is the thirty-third role played by Cornell. Cornell has been active in the American theater scene for thirty years, and she has played women such as Juliet, Saint Joan, Antigone, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Jo from "Little Women." In addition to being an actress, she has also made contributions to the American theater scene in other aspects. The result of her collaboration with her husband, McClintic, has made her a successful performer. She has introduced many unknown actors to American audiences and made them successful. This list of actors includes Evans, the British actor who played Romeo (when she played Juliet), Orson Welles (who is now a Hollywood producer), French film star Armand, and film star Gregory Peck. Many theatergoers agree with the New York Times theater critic, and support Cornell as the first woman in the American theater scene, and no one can match her on this throne.</p>
<p>Ms. Cornell also encountered opposition when she wanted to stage the play "Barretts of Wimpole Street" in 1931. Almost more than twenty-seven theater managers expressed opposition to the script, because they thought that audiences would not like a sick female character. Later, even she herself lost a little confidence, but her husband insisted that she play the play, and the result proved that the play was their most famous success.</p>
<p>Family Opposed to Studying Drama</p>
<p>Although Ms. Cornell has been immersed in the atmosphere of the theater since she was a child, her parents have always opposed her becoming an actress. Her father was Dr. Cornell. Although Dr. Cornell loved the theater, he studied medicine. When he was a graduate student at the medical school in Berlin, his young wife gave birth to her first child, Katharine. When they returned to Buffalo, Dr. Cornell gave up medicine and became the manager of the "Star Theater." When she saw the play for the first time, she was very moved. She had little interest in school, but she was quite successful in sports—such as tennis and softball. She did not go to college, and as a result, she returned to her original school to teach drama. Her family opposed her acting, they thought her face was too wide, her mouth was too big, her figure was too thin, and she was not attractive at all. But even so, she went to New York to become an actress in 1916. At first, she only played very unimportant roles, and later she did not play any roles for two years.</p>
<p>The theater manager told her: "You don't belong in the theater, go home and marry a good man!"</p>
<p>She now says: "If I only liked drama, those two years would have forced me back home."</p>
<p>Finally, her opportunity finally came. She joined the Jessie Bonstelle Stock Company. She played roles such as maids for a year, until she followed the troupe to London, she was assigned an important role: Jo in "Little Women."</p>
<p>As a result of this performance, she was hired to play the leading role in Clemence Dane's play "A Bill of Divorcement" when it was performed in the United States. When this play was in rehearsal, she married her young director, McClintic, whom she had known for five years.</p>
<p>Since 1925, all the plays starring Ms. Cornell have been directed by McClintic. The plays she has starred in include: "Candida", "The Green Hat", "Dishonored Lady", "The Age of Innocence", "Saint Joan", "The Doctor's Dilemma", "Antony and Cleopatra". She has been looking for a new script since the spring of 1948.</p>
<p>Sports and Makeup</p>
<p>Ms. Cornell possesses a "desirable and fluid face." She is slender and strong, and possesses an athlete's dignity. She plays tennis and golf very well. The teacher who taught her golf even persuaded her to give up the stage and win the golf championship.</p>
<p>She claims that she is not very interested in clothing and does not pay attention to it; and she never uses cosmetics except on stage. She rarely spends time dressing and doing her hair before performing a play.</p>
<p>She refused the suggestions that she go on screen. She does not want to leave the stage to spend time learning film techniques. She likes to "directly supply her spirit to the audience, and mingle with the audience's spirit, ...just like an electric current, through the footlights on the stage, linking the performer and the audience together."</p>
<p>Ms. Cornell does not hesitate to travel far for the audience. One year, she traveled with a troupe of fifty people while "performing three plays: "Candida", "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" and "The Age of Innocence". They traveled 16,000 miles and performed in seventy-five different places.</p>
<p>One Christmas Eve, they were delayed by floods and arrived in Seattle at 9:00 PM. They hoped to cancel the scheduled performance for that day, but they found that the people were eagerly waiting for them. So, everyone hurriedly rolled up the scenery under the gaze of the audience. Ms. Cornell officially took the stage at 1:10 AM. When the play ended, it was already 4:00 AM in the morning. (New US Information Office Manuscript)</p>
<h3 id="e39">Ample Fuel in Various Regions, Assisting Industrial Production, Establishment of the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>In order to supply the people of various regions with the coal they need, the North China Trade Corporation established the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company in Tianjin on March 30, appointing Li Nansheng as manager and Fan Juqiu as deputy manager. The scope of operations includes coal produced in Kailuan, Changcheng, Mentougou, Jingxing, Yangquan, and other places, as well as various raw and processed iron and raw materials, and handles coal and iron export matters. In addition to establishing the Second, Third, and Fourth Coal Mines of the Coal Industry Company in Tianjin, branch companies are established in Peiping, Baoding, and Qinhuangdao, offices are established in Tangshan, Tanggu, and Mentougou, and distribution offices are established in Shengfang and Zhengzhou.</p>
<p>Among the underground resources in North China, coal is the most abundant. According to the estimates of the Geological Survey Institute: the coal reserves in the seven provinces of North China total 212.5 billion metric tons, of which Shanxi and Hebei have the most, and all belong to the Paleozoic era. The thickness of the upper coal seam ranges from 100 meters to 220 meters, and the thickness of the lower coal seam ranges from 100 meters to 150 meters. If the land area and reserves are compared, there are about 156,000 metric tons per square kilometer, while the national calculation is about 22,000 metric tons per square kilometer. In terms of population, there are about 1,500 metric tons per person in North China, while the national average is about 550 metric tons per person.</p>
<p>Looking at the various mines under the management of the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Mine Name Coal Quality Reserves Production</p>
<p>Kailuan Coking Coal 690 Million Tons 4 Million Tons</p>
<p>Changcheng Anthracite 70,000 Tons</p>
<p>Mentougou Anthracite 500,000 Tons</p>
<p>Jingxing Coking Coal 221 Million Tons 1 Million Tons</p>
<p>Yangquan Non-Coking Coal 200,000 Tons</p>
<p>Coal is the power and source of all productive enterprises, especially the quality of the mines in North China, which is superior to other places. Coking coal such as Kailuan and Jingxing is the best raw material for making coke. Non-coking coal is an excellent fuel for trains and other boilers, and has the reputation of solid gasoline. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese tried to refine artificial petroleum from coal using the low-temperature dry distillation method, and the results were said to be quite good.</p>
<p>After the liberation of the Pingjin area, the output of underground treasures has been increasing day by day. Now, the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company has been established to handle the distribution and marketing affairs, which will not only provide ample fuel for the people of various regions, but also make various industries flourish.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Shanghai Branch of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Issues a Letter to Fellow Citizens of Shanghai <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The following is the text of the letter to fellow citizens of Shanghai from the Shanghai Provisional Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang: Dear fellow citizens of Shanghai: Now that Great Shanghai has been liberated, the day that we five million people have been expecting day and night has finally arrived. The liberation of Shanghai this time is not only a great victory for the People's Liberation Army, not only a victory for the united front of various democratic parties, but a victory for the five million people of Shanghai in resisting the dark forces. We must celebrate the liberation of Great Shanghai with excitement, and we must welcome the arrival of the People's Liberation Army with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The reactionary government of the Chiang Kai-shek gang is a garbage group of warlords, bureaucrats, wealthy families, and compradors. They are all bloodsuckers, and they are doing everything possible, not for a minute, not for a second, not trying to suck the blood of the Chinese people to fatten themselves. In the counter-revolutionary war of massacring the people that they themselves launched, although they have failed miserably, the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek can still escape to South China, attempting to gather the remaining reactionary forces for a final struggle. Although the people of Shanghai have been liberated, there are still many compatriots throughout China living a life of slavery under the tyranny of the Chiang Kai-shek gang. Therefore, the people of Shanghai should be excited for victory and rejoice for liberation. However, after excitement and rejoicing, we must stand up firmly and continue to fight, completely eliminate all reactionary troops, and liberate the people of the whole country. At the same time, in Shanghai, we firmly believe that there must be many reactionary secret agents and war criminals lurking in the local area. They want to continue to massacre the people of Shanghai and hinder the progress of the Chinese liberation cause at all times and in all places. They are the enemies of our people. We must fight these lurking reactionary forces to the death, expose them, settle accounts with them, and completely eliminate them. The revolution must be carried through to the end. Revolution and reaction, light and darkness, cannot be compromised at all. Only after we have uprooted all reactionary forces can a new China of New Democracy emerge.</p>
<p>The content of New Democracy is the same as Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People. In the new China of New Democracy, everyone is equal, everyone has freedom, everyone has food to eat, and everyone has something to do. There is absolutely no phenomenon of people eating people. The purpose of the revolution is not destruction but construction. While we must continue to fight in the negative aspect to completely destroy the reactionary forces, we must also make redoubled efforts in the positive aspect to unite the hearts of 450 million people into one heart and unite the strength of 450 million people into one force, shedding blood and sweat, working together, and building a new democratic country. Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and Shanghai is the capital for building a new China. Our five million people of Shanghai should stand in front of the people of the whole country, each guarding their own post, increasing production, working actively, and shedding our last drop of blood and our last drop of sweat for building a new China. Our will must be firm, and our spirit must be aroused. Not a single drop of blood and not a single drop of sweat will be shed in vain.</p>
<p>Dear fellow citizens of Shanghai! The dark night has passed, and the day has dawned. From now on, we can live a democratic and free life. No one will suck our blood, and no one will eat our flesh. However, we still need to wage a difficult struggle against the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, and at the same time, we also need to wage a positive struggle to realize the new China of New Democracy.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic League's Letter to Fellow Citizens for the Liberation of Shanghai <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Let us cheer the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in liberating Shanghai! Since the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the assistance of US imperialism, violated the will of the people, broke the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and launched a nationwide reactionary war against the Chinese people, our patriotic students, workers, and democrats have been arrested and shot, innocent civilians have been exploited and persecuted, schools have been destroyed, and industry and commerce have been squeezed to the point of disintegration, all of which are well known to our fellow citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Our China Democratic League, because of its efforts for China's democracy, peace, unity, and unification, and its adherence to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, has been persecuted by the Kuomintang reactionary regime since 1937, and was declared illegal and dissolved by the Ministry of Interior of the reactionary government. Since then, thousands of League members have been illegally detained and killed throughout the country. However, the League headquarters was not subdued by coercion. After rebuilding the League headquarters in Hong Kong, it called on comrades throughout the country who had gone underground to fight to the end for the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-dictatorial democratic revolutionary united front. Our comrades, the League members in Shanghai, have never neglected this sacred work, even though they have always been in terror and danger. From now on, we must cooperate sincerely with our compatriots throughout the country, the Chinese Communist Party, and other democratic parties, and continue to work hard to resolutely and completely eliminate all reactionary forces within China, and liberate the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>The People's Liberation Army, which liberated Shanghai, is our people's own army, and will, under the principles of New Democracy, earnestly implement policies such as protecting the lives and property of the people, supporting national industry and commerce, cultivating cultural and educational undertakings, and improving the lives of workers and peasants. Our fellow citizens of Shanghai should stay at their posts, not be alarmed, abide by the laws and regulations of the democratic government, maintain social order, and expose special agents who conspire to sabotage. National banks and state-owned enterprises should continue to work as usual, awaiting takeover, shops should continue to operate as usual, factories should continue to start work as usual, schools should continue to attend classes as usual, develop production, prosper the economy, take into account both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital, in order to rebuild a new Shanghai and build a new China. The League is willing to encourage each other with fellow citizens from all walks of life!</p>
<p>Finally, we salute the hard-working and meritorious soldiers of the People's Liberation Army! We salute Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission! We salute all fellow citizens throughout the country who are fighting for the democratic revolution!</p>
<h3 id="e42">"Atomic Doctor" <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Hama</p>
<p>A medical story from the atomic age, proving that the same science that created the atomic bomb can prevent, rather than cause, suffering and death. When the battle on Sugar Loaf Hill on the island of Okinawa was taking place in May 1945, a U.S. Marine fell, seriously wounded. The medical team immediately gave him a blood transfusion, and he was saved. Before the end of the war, millions had been brought back to life in the same way. But without an "atomic doctor," the blood bank system could not have been established.</p>
<p>In the United States, a patient lay waiting for surgery to amputate his injured leg. Many doctors were discussing: could they preserve his knee joint? If the knee joint could be saved, and he was fitted with a prosthetic leg, he could walk almost as well as he used to. They needed to decide quickly.</p>
<p>They used a new technique to determine that the blood flow around his knee joint was normal, and it was sufficient to amputate the lower leg. Thanks to the "atomic doctor," this person could live a normal life.</p>
<p>In another hospital, a patient was dying from a seemingly incurable case of leukemia. But as a result of the same clever atomic doctor, this patient was finally discharged from the hospital, able to live at least a few more years of interested life.</p>
<p>Other atomic activities include quite successful treatments for thyroid and polycythemia, as well as disease diagnosis using radioisotopes obtained from splitting atoms. If these important studies continue to succeed, they will create an even greater era. Experiments are underway to turn atomic weapons against mankind's terrible enemies. Scientists are applying the radiation produced by atomic bombs in an attempt to find the roots of some of the most terrifying diseases and cancers. Before examining the research on atomic energy against cancer, we can take a look at what atomic medical tools are and how they have made the aforementioned achievements possible.</p>
<p>Medical researchers, using new atomic methods, have discovered that radioactive isotopes are a potential ally. An isotope of any chemical element is a chemical element that is heavier or lighter than the regular atom. But except for this difference in weight, the properties of isotopes are exactly the same as those of regular chemical elements. Of course, some elements are inherently radioactive, such as uranium. By utilizing the identical properties of isotopes and their ability to emit radiation, they can be made into valuable "tracers" in living tissues and used as a medical medium to carry radiation to parts of the body that are normally inaccessible.</p>
<p>In the decade before June 14, 1946, research groups found that obtaining even small amounts of radioactivity was both difficult and expensive. However, on that day, the U.S. Army announced that isotopes of one hundred different elements were now being produced in the chain-reaction uranium pile at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. These isotopes would be supplied in considerable quantities and at low cost for research, especially in medicine. As a result, the United States no longer needed to rely on the expensive and inefficient tools of the past. Many authorities immediately predicted that the abundant supply of isotopes would greatly accelerate the progress of atomic medicine.</p>
<p>But in the early days of World War II, there were not so many isotopes. Nevertheless, even the small quantities of isotopes available still produced many miracles. For example, at one point, the U.S. military medical authorities found it necessary to transport large quantities of blood from Asia to Europe and store it for long periods. Until then, no method had been found to keep blood cells alive for more than a few days. But the actual requirement was to find a way to preserve blood and keep it alive for more than three weeks, and this method needed to be found quickly. To find this method, it was necessary to test many chemical solutions and their properties, and testing many solutions would take a lot of time.</p>
<p>As a result, a group of physicists from MIT and Harvard solved this problem. Their solution was based on the fact that when iron compounds are injected into blood vessels, they are absorbed by hemoglobin molecules to produce red blood cells. Because of this phenomenon, they could use radioactive isotope iron to "trace" the behavior of blood stored in various solutions. Their first step was to produce iron isotopes in the atomic bomber in Massachusetts and then introduce a small amount of isotope iron into the blood vessels of the blood donor. Ten to fourteen days later, when the iron had been assimilated into the blood cells, blood was released from the blood donor and this same blood was introduced into various blood preservation solutions.</p>
<p>These solutions were then stored at various temperatures for considerable periods, and finally, blood transfusions were performed. After the transfusion, a device called a Geiger counter was used to check the radiation emitted by the isotopes in each recipient. If this radiation disappeared more quickly after the transfusion, it indicated that most of the red blood cells preserved in the solution had died, and the radioactive iron released from them had been eliminated from the blood more quickly.</p>
<p>Using this method to eliminate unsatisfactory chemical solutions, scientists in New Zealand quickly discovered an ABC solution, namely acid citrate dextrose, which could keep blood alive for 21 to 26 days in refrigerators at 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. As a result, this compound was quickly used to transport plasma and red blood cells to save more than 100,000 wounded soldiers in the Pacific. In some critical situations, some blood stored for 40 days was still successfully used for transfusions.</p>
<p>Examining various parts of the body to determine whether surgery is necessary by employing a "tracing" technique. This technique involves injecting radioactive isotopes into the blood and then using a "Geiger counter" to observe the travel of those radioactive particles. In a situation where blood circulation is good and tissues are vigorously absorbing the food and oxygen they desperately need, amputation is not necessary.</p>
<p>The two examples of atomic medicine cited here use radioactivity to explore the condition of living cells. If a stronger dose of isotopes is used, it can destroy diseased and malignant growths in human tissue. Leukemia is a disease that can cause the bone marrow to produce an improper large amount of white blood cells. This disease can be temporarily cured by injecting large amounts of concentrated isotopes. The leukemia patient mentioned above was later temporarily cured by injecting radioactive phosphorus. The radiation emitted by radioactive phosphorus reduces the activity of the bone marrow, and the number of white blood cells gradually decreases. After continuous injections, this patient was finally discharged from the hospital, and he could at least have a considerable period without pain.</p>
<p>Another disease is polycythemia, which is characterized by an excess of red blood cells. This disease can also be alleviated by using radioactive phosphorus. Hyperthyroidism can also be treated with radioactive isotopes. Since the thyroid gland absorbs 99% of the iodine in the body, doctors can safely use radioactive iodine.</p>
<p>The recent achievements in atomic medicine are too numerous to mention. You have noticed that the occurrence of diseases such as leukemia, polycythemia, and hyperthyroidism is due to the fact that certain tissues grow a larger quantity of products than the normal amount. We can compare this with the definition of cancer, "cancer" is a chaotic situation caused by the frantic and rapid growth of cells in the body, which destroys important organs. Clearly, this has already reminded people of the similarity in degree between cancer and the above-mentioned diseases, and those diseases have been proven to be resolved by atomic medicine.

<h3 id="e43">Postscript to the National Women's Congress <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] On March 24th, the first National Congress of Chinese Women was convened in Peiping. The representatives participating included women representatives from the liberated areas of the Northwest, Northeast, North China, East China, and Central Plains, as well as the areas ruled by the Kuomintang, and even overseas Chinese women representatives. It can be described as a grand event in the revolutionary history of Chinese women.</p>
<p>The congress lasted for eleven days and achieved very fruitful results. The meeting decided to issue a declaration in response to the World Congress for the Defense of Peace, and elected representatives to attend other important cases. When discussing the current direction and tasks of the Chinese women's movement, the representatives became even more enthusiastic, vying to speak. Regarding the direction of the women's movement, everyone unanimously supported Deng Yingchao's opinions and propositions. She said, "Without relaxing the work of rural women, focus on the work of urban women." She also said, "The task of women's work is mainly to mobilize and organize women of all strata to participate in production." The women worker representatives unanimously expressed on the spot that they would work harder in production in the future, set an example, and be heroes in the construction of the New China. The representatives from the countryside were also very happy to hear this. Liu Jinying, a rural labor hero from the Northwest liberated area, said at a group meeting, "Rural women have already had tasks, and now urban women also have tasks. The congress must cooperate and learn from each other in order to promote the work, and the national victory can be realized sooner."</p>
<p>On April 3rd, the eleventh day after the opening of the congress, which was also the closing day, the scheduled tasks were completed in a grand and solemn ceremony. On that day, Commander Zhu De and Mayor Ye Jianying of Peiping City also attended the meeting. The congress presented Commander Zhu De with two red flags dedicated to the people's leaders, Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander Zhu De. Commander Zhu De received the flags from the congress. The flag dedicated to Chairman Mao Zedong read, "Forever follow you forward." The flag dedicated to Commander Zhu De read, "Without the victory of today's People's Liberation Army, there would be no liberation of Chinese women." After receiving the flags, Commander Zhu De addressed the representatives, hoping that they would go back, unite women across the country, complete the New Democratic Revolution, and build a New China. After Lei Jieqiong delivered the closing speech, Mayor Ye Jianying also spoke in succession.</p>
<p>The day the National Congress of Chinese Women closed was also the day the All-China Democratic Women's Federation was declared established. On the previous day, the congress elected 51 members of the Executive Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, leaving four vacancies to be filled after the national liberation. At the congress on the 3rd, Chairman Liu Yaxiong announced the list of elected members and declared the birth of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, which won applause from the audience. The list of 51 executive committee members is as follows: Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, He Xiangning, Zhang Qinqiu, Kang Keqing, Qu Mengjue, Yang Zhihua, Liu Yaxiong, Shuai Mengqi, Luo Qiong, Xu Guangping, Zhang Yun, Yang Yunyu, Zhang Jinbao, Li Peizhi, Li Dequan, Tian Xiujuan, Chen Shaomin, Ding Ling, Shen Zijiu, Xie Xuehong, Luo Shuzhang, Zhang Xiuyan, Li Wenyi, Lu Cui, Zeng Mengjun, Wulan, Qian Zhengying, Yang Gang, Wang Yuecun, Lei Jieqiong, Li Jianzhen, Yang Zhifang, Zhang Zifang, Li Zhen, Feng Qiuming, Li Fenglian, Qi Yuande, Zhao Feng, Yang Kebing, Hu Ziying, Zhao Shilan, Li Boying, Zhang Xiaomei, Liu Wang Liming, Han Qimin, Qiu Yihan, Deng Kang, Chen Boke, Jiang Yi.</p>
<p>The National Congress of Chinese Women and the All-China Women's Federation are, in form, the first major union of revolutionary women. In fact, since the post-"May Fourth" period, Chinese women have participated in the revolutionary struggle alongside workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals for more than 30 years. Deng Yingchao, deputy director of the preparatory committee for the first National Congress of Chinese Women, praised it in a broadcast on the Xinhua Radio Station in Peiping on March 27th. She said, "The heroic and tenacious spirit of Chinese working women in the revolution has made a significant contribution to the Chinese revolution and has become an indispensable force." During the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the vast number of women in the liberated areas gathered together and responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party, participating in various anti-Japanese works with a selfless spirit. He pointed out that during the two and a half years of the war, 50% to 60% of the total number of women with labor capacity were mobilized to support the front lines, mobilize to join the army, or participate in production. Women's efforts to participate in labor production have achieved good results. In particular, the sideline production of rural women, namely spinning and weaving, has greatly increased after the launch of the self-sufficiency movement to ensure military and civilian needs. After 1948, the production of the rear was mainly relied on by women, thus greatly improving the status of women.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Northeast · North China: Advancing Towards Construction <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Northeast Public Enterprises Launch Competition Movement</p>
<p>[Pan Yang Dispatch] The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions recently called on workers in Northeast public enterprises to launch a production competition movement. During the competition, all industries will deliberate and handle matters based on their specific circumstances. Those who win the competition will be awarded certificates and prizes. At the same time, it is pointed out how leadership should engage in backlog preparation.</p>
<p>[Pan Yang Dispatch] Public enterprises in various parts of the Northeast are generally launching large-scale production competition movements to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day. The Harbin Electrical Repair Factory has completed four months of production tasks within two months since the competition began on February 1st. The bleaching powder department of the factory originally planned to produce 90 tons of bleaching powder in March, but by March 24th, it had produced 110 tons (the highest monthly output during the puppet Manchukuo period was 108 tons). The monthly output of hydrochloric acid in the factory has reached 118 tons, exceeding the monthly output during the puppet Manchukuo era by 28 tons. The repair department is striving to complete the repair plan for the first half of 1949 two months ahead of schedule by "May 1st". The No. 2 mine of the Northeast Third Coal Mining Area adopts the method of individual and group order plans, and conducts competitions with the pit entrance as a unit. In the first eight days of March, the total output of the mine reached 3,216 tons, exceeding the planned 22%. During the competition, the No. 1 Coal Mining Area of the mine has made great improvements in mining methods. For example, the daily output of a coal mining tunnel in the No. 1 pit has increased from more than 100 tons to more than 200 tons due to changes in mining methods, and the mining rate has increased from 30% to 60%. Since the launch of the competition in the Sunjiawan Mine of the Fuxin Coal Mining Bureau, the amount of coal mined has increased from an average of three tons per person per day to six tons. The amount of coal mined by worker Cui Yi has increased to ten tons. Due to the timely praise and criticism through blackboards and active improvement of workers' meals in the Northeast Woolen Mill during the competition, both output and quality have been improved. The output of a cotton weaving department of the factory has increased from 140 pieces of cotton cloth per day to 200 pieces. The Jinzhou Railway Bureau Locomotive Section strives to complete two typical locomotives in early April. In other industrial cities such as Andong, Jilin, Changchun, Qiqihar, and Mudanjiang, the workers of public enterprises such as railways, military industries, textiles, rubber, paper making, and electricity are also actively working hard to complete the competition plan.</p>
<p>Railways, Mines, and Factories Cultivate Technical Workers</p>
<p>[Pan Yang Dispatch] Railways, mines, and factories in Pan Yang, Harbin, Fushun, and other places are cultivating technical workers and organizing technical studies in a planned way to improve technology and quality. Among the 160 artisans in the machinery branch of the Huanggu Tun Railway Factory in Pan Yang, unskilled artisans account for 30% of the total. Therefore, training technical workers is a major task of the branch. The factory administration first conducts education for technical workers, focusing on breaking their old concepts of conservative technology, and then absorbs the opinions of foremen, team leaders, and veteran technical workers to formulate methods for training technical workers: (1) Change the past phenomenon of not giving unskilled artisans single beds, and let him be solely responsible for one, with foremen, team leaders, and veteran technical workers providing more specific help to make him more proficient faster. (2) Try to make helpers and unskilled workers first do simple work, and then gradually go from shallow to deep. (3) Organize technical studies, compile helpers, unskilled workers, and apprentices into several groups, and let veteran technical workers take turns explaining technical theories. The factory has now started according to the above methods. According to the opinions of the workers' representatives, Pan Yang Automobile No. 11 Factory organized a spare-time technical training class for employees without affecting production. Technicians and experienced workers served as teachers, and adopted a teaching method that focused on practical technology to help workers learn automobile construction, repair methods, electrical engineering, and fault inspection methods. The Harbin Machinery Iron Factory established a technical research association. The research center focuses on working methods, practical difficulties encountered in production, how to identify various materials and their properties, and how to use tools and machines. After the problems in production were raised to the research association by the red furnace and sand turning teams, the experienced workers exchanged technical opinions and solved many forging methods by doing and researching at the same time, and improved the quality of finished products. The factory decided that members who have achieved certain achievements in research may be rewarded as model researchers after being publicly elected by the research association and approved by the factory management committee. In order to improve the oil production technology and theoretical knowledge of employees, the Fushun Coal Mining Bureau Oil Refinery is actively carrying out the translation of relevant materials. At the same time, in order to solve the difficulties of technicians in lubricating oil, gasoline, sulfur, paraffin, etc., the factory is planning to run various technical training courses.</p>
<p>Fushun Electrical Porcelain Factory Output Reaches Highest Peak</p>
<p>[Pan Yang Dispatch] The Fushun Electrical Porcelain Factory has manufactured a total of 216,000 high and low voltage insulating porcelain pieces in three months, with an average monthly output of more than 62,000 pieces, creating the factory's highest record in the fourteen years since its establishment. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the factory's highest record was an average monthly output of 32,000 pieces. At present, the quality of products has also been greatly improved. The finished products account for 84% of the burnt volume. In the most recent burn, the finished products even increased to 94.4%. These achievements of the factory are mainly the result of workers' high enthusiasm for production. The factory is now working hard to complete the plan to produce 250,000 high-voltage electrical porcelain pieces in the next four months.</p>
<p>[Tianjin Dispatch] Under the correct leadership of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government and the Preparatory Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, the labor-capital relations of the two major private yarn factories in Tianjin, Hengyuan and Beiyang, have been initially improved. The output of the Hengyuan Yarn Factory has reached the pre-liberation level. The output of the Beiyang Yarn Factory has increased by more than 15% compared to when it was just liberated. Therefore, the Hengyuan Yarn Factory produces an average of 45 pieces of 20-count yarn per day, 400 pounds per piece, and 400 bolts of cloth, which is 68% higher than the output when it was just liberated. The Beiyang Yarn Factory now produces an average of 37 pieces of yarn per day. Because the labor-capital relations have been reasonably resolved, the phenomenon of wasting raw materials has also been greatly reduced. The factories of the two factories are vigorously searching for raw materials and actively expanding production.</p>
<p>Tianjin Production Advances Rapidly Exceeding Target</p>
<p>[Tianjin Dispatch] Public enterprise units such as the Zhang Guizhuang Railway Factory and the Xiangjiao Parts Factory in Tianjin City have successfully completed or exceeded the production plan for March. The Tianjin Machinery Factory exceeded the original plan by 8% to 80% in the repair work of freight cars, passenger cars, and automobiles. It repaired a tractor with waste materials. The automobile tires and battery boxes produced by the Rubber Parts Factory have all completed the plan. The inner and outer tires of bicycles exceeded the plan by 10% to 20%. Most of the products of the Tianjin Automobile Manufacturing Plant were completed on schedule. Storage batteries and Jemsi piston rings also exceeded the plan. The Tianjin Automobile Repair Factory completed the plan to repair 82 cars, including 40 major repairs, exceeding the number of major repairs in February by 60%. Seven workers in the water meter repair room of the waterworks were sent to study, and they repaired 236 water meters, which was 36 more than the original plan, and 67 more than in February. The work of installing water meters and repairing air pumps in the pipe room of the same factory has exceeded the plan. The car repair work of the Hebei Car Repair Factory of the Public Transport Management Office has also been successfully completed. The employees of various enterprises have shown a high degree of enthusiasm in their work, voluntarily extending working hours, making full use of waste materials to improve technology and management, and overcoming many difficulties. Some factory workers have also launched a production competition. This is the key to completing and exceeding the production plan, but the production plan of individual enterprises has not been completed because it is not based on actual production capacity and has not mobilized employees to discuss.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the liberation of Tianjin, under the active leadership and assistance of the People's Government, public and private factories quickly resumed work to cooperate with the national liberation war and the general goal of developing production and prospering the economy. Before liberation, Dasheng Factory was subjected to various oppressions and exclusions from imperialism and bureaucratic capital, and tried its best to squeeze the workers in the factory. After liberation, with the help of the People's Government, the factory officially resumed work on January 19. The factory's workers' work group, on the one hand, persuaded the capitalists to gradually liberate the workers' reasonable demands according to the actual situation, and on the other hand, vigorously implemented the education policy and made appropriate adjustments. At the same time, it announced the dissolution of the trade union, stopped all activities of the trade union leader, and cleansed the individual trade union leaders who had done many evils and were deeply hated by the people.</p>
<p>Due to the above reasons, the production enthusiasm of employees has increased day by day. The phenomenon of late arrival and early departure of ordinary workers has been eliminated. The workers of the preservation section have tried every means to increase production, pieced together the empty spindles on the spinning frame, and completed the seven-day task in four days. In the case of extreme difficulty in raw materials and parts, Zhao Jiming, a worker in the leather stick room, quickly completed the leather sticks for the air force. In the past, if the workers in the electrical department repaired the large motor in the steel wire room, it would take at least four hours for six people, but now it only takes two hours. The workers in the repair section rushed to make 80 iron baskets and lead wire baskets in 20 days to replace the bamboo baskets. The iron baskets are much more durable than the bamboo baskets, but the price is 200 yuan cheaper than the bamboo baskets. In terms of saving raw materials, the workers voluntarily cleaned up the cotton on the ground, and there were very few broken threads on the yarn splices. Because the workers in the spinning room can consciously cherish materials, the average daily loss of 85 pairs of leather sticks is reduced to 40 pairs. The workers in the shafting machine used waste materials and spent three days to research and improve, and can save more than ten pounds of cotton per week. The production management personnel also assumed their due responsibilities, and some actively helped the workers to sort out the machines and roll the cotton yarn. Therefore, the output and quality of the factory have exceeded the normal production level before liberation, and reached an unprecedented level. For example, before liberation, the factory produced an average of 0.031 pounds of 20-count yarn per spindle per hour. Now, it produces an average of 0.0345 pounds of 20-count yarn per spindle per hour, which is 11.2% higher than before liberation. There has also been significant improvement in quality. The cotton yarn is white and uniform. Therefore, the sales are very good, and the market price per package (400 pounds) is 1,000 to 2,000 yuan higher than before.</p>
<p>Private Factories Revived Half Have Been Restored</p>
<p>[Tianjin Dispatch] Through the joint efforts of the Fourth District Work Group and relevant departments, 19 of the 42 factories in the Fourth District had resumed work by early April, and another 14 factories were actively preparing to start work. Only nine factories were unable to start work in the short term due to damage by artillery fire or lack of responsible persons.</p>
<p>After the liberation of Tianjin, the capitalists of general factories did not understand the industrial and commercial policies of the People's Government. Therefore, only eight of the 42 factories in the Fourth District started production until late February. The district government convened a symposium for the persons in charge of each factory on February 23. In addition to explaining the industrial and commercial policies by the staff, the persons in charge of several factories that had already started work were also in charge of explaining their experience and views. This meeting was very effective, so that some factory owners understood that "both labor and capital benefit" is a decision made by both labor and capital after democratic discussion, and both parties must agree. Their concerns were reduced, and eleven companies resumed operations within half a month after the meeting.</p>
<p>Most of the other factories in the Fourth District that have not been able to start work do not have labor-capital disputes.</p>
<p>Laiyang Improves Life and Organizes Production Promotion Society</p>
<p>[Laiyang Dispatch] Laiyang City is a relatively developed industrial and commercial city in eastern Shandong. It is a distribution center for peanuts, taro, ramie, and chestnuts. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, it was subjected to long-term looting and searching by the enemy and puppets, making people's lives difficult and hard. Stores closed down and factories went bankrupt. In August 1945, Laiyang was liberated, and the democratic government distributed relief grain and relief loans, and people's lives began to improve.</p>
<p>At the beginning of July 1946, when the Production Promotion Society was established, the working principles and business were not yet specific, but the principles were determined to "support the production of the masses and serve the masses."</p>
<p>In September, the Promotion Society left the countryside and moved into the city, determining that the future business would be to develop the textile industry.</p>
<p>The Production Promotion Society encountered difficulties and tried to solve these problems so that the textile industry could develop.</p>
<p>(1) Proactively contact the district and village, communicate the relationship, and jointly establish a production promotion committee to unify the research and deployment of production work in the urban area.</p>
<p>(2) Specifically grasp the typical people to promote externally and develop the number of spinners.</p>
<p>(3) Use reward methods to gradually improve technology, stimulate the development of spinners, improve the quality of spun yarn, and improve the enthusiasm of spinning women.</p>
<p>(4) Solve difficulties in a timely manner, help develop, and ensure the timely supply of raw materials.</p>
<p>Because the Promotion Society properly and correctly solved the above four problems, the textile industry in the city expanded to Shannanguan Village, Rulin Village, and then to Heping Village, and by the end of the year it was popularized to every village.</p>
<h3 id="e45">A Perspective on Northeast Agriculture <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Under the leadership of the Northeast Administrative Committee and the awards of the People's Government, various parts of Northeast China have actively increased agricultural production, such as increasing grain production, carrying out sideline production, manufacturing agricultural tools, and logging timber, and have achieved significant results. According to the Xinhua News Agency's repeated release of telecommunications, a collection of descriptions is as follows!</p>
<p>Strengthen Spring Cultivation Work Actively Increase Grain Production</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the leadership of the organization of spring cultivation work and mobilize and organize the masses to actively produce, the Northeast Administrative Committee issued an agricultural production order, notifying governments at all levels to quickly mobilize cadres, mobilize and organize the masses to actively engage in production, and strive to complete the increase of 1.8 million dan of grain this year. The production order pointed out that "recognizing that all feudal properties that have been distributed belong to private individuals, allowing individuals to freely operate, and issuing land certificates and house certificates to determine land rights and house rights, ensuring that their own labor employs people to operate normal interest income and under specific regulations, the income from renting land completely belongs to them, and guaranteeing freedom of exchange, no one may infringe." In addition, regulations have also been made on basic issues related to agricultural production.</p>
<p>The Northeast Administrative Committee plans to sow 3 million mu of paddy fields in the Northeast this spring. Last year, there were only more than 2.11 million mu of paddy fields in the Northeast, and this year, 880,000 mu will be restored and increased. It is estimated that 149,000 tons of grain can be produced this autumn.</p>
<p>Organize Farmers in Various Places to Carry Out Sideline Production</p>
<p>The democratic governments of the newly liberated areas of Liaoning, Liaoxi, and Rehe provinces are organizing farmers to carry out sideline production and preparing for spring cultivation. The Liaoyang County Government has sent work teams to distribute disaster relief grain to areas with severe disasters, and organize disaster victims to use the loan grain to carry out production such as gold panning, logging, charcoal burning, and fishing. With the help of the government, the farmers in the suburbs of Yingkou City organized 594 production groups to carry out production such as salt transportation, fishing, manure collection, and transportation, which has initially solved the lives of more than 27,000 people. Some farmers have also purchased livestock, etc., and are actively preparing for spring cultivation. According to the characteristics of the developed textile industry in Xin Hui and other places in Rehe Province, the People's Government lent grain and cotton seed money to disaster victims as capital for spring cultivation. On the one hand, the local cooperatives lent 17,500 jin of cotton and 29 looms, and mobilized more than 20,700 women to participate in textile. The counties in western Liaoning generally mobilized disaster victims to weave mats and textiles. Most areas have solved the problem of food for three or four months.</p>
<p>Public Mechanical Farms Are in High Spirits for Production</p>
<p>The spring cultivation preparation work of the twelve public mechanical farms in various parts of the Northeast is nearing completion, and they will soon be able to start cultivating. The four mechanical farms directly operated by the Agriculture Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee, namely, the Heilongjiang Provincial, the Hegjiang Provincial Dong'an, the Nenjiang Provincial, and the Pan Yang Masanjiazi, have prepared and repaired the houses and cultivated the roads and bridges in the spring cultivation. They are currently disinfecting seeds and will start plowing and spring cultivation only after the land thaws. The above four farms have a total of 5,450 mu of arable land and 52 tractors. In addition, the spring cultivation preparation work of the eight mechanical farms in Songjiang, Hegjiang, Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, Liaobei, Liaoning, Jilin and other seven provinces is also coming to an end. These eight farms have a total of 10,700 mu of arable land, 108 tractors, and other new types of agricultural tools. Recently, the Agriculture Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has supplemented a total of 140 tons of gasoline and 360 tons of seed oil according to the needs of tractors and fuel in various farms. At the same time, it also allocated 310 tons of wheat seeds to sow coal in time after Qingming. At present, the trade unions of various public farms have also been established, and the agricultural workers are in high spirits for production.</p>
<p>Manufacture Large Quantities of Agricultural Tools to Increase Agricultural Production</p>
<p>Under the awards of the People's Government, farmers and public agricultural tool manufacturing factories in various parts of Northeast China have created and transformed many agricultural tools to improve agricultural productivity. Zhao Jinzhang, a farmer in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, manufactured a horse-drawn seeder that can automatically till the soil. This seeder has been proven to save labor and sow quickly after testing. The Yingnong Tool Factory in Heilongjiang Province is now manufacturing and promoting it in large quantities for adoption in various places. In addition, the weeding machine manufactured by the factory has also been successfully tested and is being distributed to various places for use by the Provincial Department of Agriculture in a planned manner. The Farmer Experimental Station in Nehe County, Nenjiang Province, has also recently created a single-limit seeder and a weeding seeder. The effect is that the ordinary seeding method can save three man-days and one horse-day. The weeding seeder saves five man-days compared with the manual weeding method. More than 10,000 sets of these two newly created agricultural tools have been manufactured and are being promoted to areas lacking manpower and livestock. Jin Zisheng, a labor model in Linjiang County, Andong Province, transformed ordinary plows into wasteland plows with three bayonets. After testing, it was found that the new plow can save one-third of the labor compared with the ordinary wasteland reclamation method, and can increase the efficiency of wasteland reclamation by three times. The Linjiang County Agricultural Tool Factory has manufactured enough sets of this new plow, and the government has lent it to farmers for use. In addition, agricultural tool factories in Hegjiang, Jilin, Liaoning and other provinces have also recently rushed to manufacture a large number of new types of agricultural tools, preparing to lend them to farmers in various places before spring cultivation.</p>
<p>Logging Task Completed Huge Amounts of Timber Awaiting Transportation</p>
<p>The task of logging 4 million cubic meters of timber in the winter in the entire Northeast region has been completed. The forestry bureaus of various provinces are now working intensively to organize transportation. The task of transporting this huge amount of timber is planned to be completed by the end of this year. Among the 4 million cubic meters of timber, 1.63 million cubic meters are transported by forest railways, 1.8 million cubic meters are transported by rafting, 430,000 cubic meters require double transportation by rafting and forest railways, and the rest are transported by horse-drawn carriages and livestock. In order to complete the transportation task quickly, the forestry bureaus of various provinces will launch a rushing transportation competition movement. The Northeast Forestry General Bureau has allocated huge bonuses to reward transportation models.</p>

<p>[Special Article from This Newspaper] At the beginning of March this year, student representatives from all over the country convened the 14th National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation in Beijing, the birthplace of the "May Fourth" Movement, and held this grand meeting on the eve of the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution.</p>
<p>On May 6, 1919, that is, the third day after the outbreak of the "May Fourth" Movement, the "Beijing Federation of Students Above Secondary Level" was established under the auspices of middle and high school students in Beijing, and at the same time, students from all over the country were to organize their own national organizations. On the 16th of the same month, student representatives from all over the country convened the First National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation in Shanghai. The "General Federation of Students of the Republic of China" was produced at the meeting. From 1919 to 1928, the organization that led the Chinese student movement held nine national student congresses under the persecution of counter-revolutionary feudal remnants. Students from all over the country actively participated in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle. Taking the "May Thirtieth" Movement in 1925 as an example, it was one of the examples of heroic struggle.</p>
<p>In October 1929, the Central Training Department of the Kuomintang ordered the "General Federation of Students of the Republic of China" to stop its activities. It was not until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War of "September 18" and "January 28" that the Chinese student movement entered a new stage. Then the "December 9th" Movement in 1935 broke out.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1936, another national student congress opened in Shanghai, re-establishing the Chinese Students' Federation, but in fact it was the "First National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation," calling for a comprehensive anti-Japanese war. Since then, the Twelfth and Thirteenth National Student Congresses of the All-China Students' Federation were held in Wuhan in the summer of 1938, advocating adhering to the resistance to the end and opposing compromise and surrender, and in Shanghai in June 1947 to launch an anti-hunger and anti-civil war movement. Its work and activities have been unfolding.</p>
<h3 id="e47">North China Agriculture and Forestry Construction <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>This Year's Agricultural Production Plan</p>
<p>The North China People's Government has announced the agricultural production plan for the North China Liberated Area for 1949. This plan was drafted by the North China Department of Agriculture, studied and passed by the North China Agricultural and Forestry Conference, and then approved and announced by the North China People's Government Committee. The guiding principle of the plan is to increase grain production and ensure the supply of raw materials for industry. Based on this principle, the plan stipulates that the entire North China region should increase grain production by 7.5 million shi (誤 corrected to 1.5 million dan of grain, originally mistranslated), which is an average increase of five shi sheng per mu; increase cotton (seed cotton) production by 130 million jin, so that the total cotton harvest for the year will increase to 300 million jin; and for oil crops such as peanuts and hemp, the goal is to achieve a total harvest of 933 million jin for the year. To increase cotton and oil crop production, the plan stipulates expanding the cotton field area by 70 percent, meaning planting 12 million mu of cotton in the entire region. The plan calls for 4 million mu for peanuts among the oil crops. The plan compensates for the reduced grain output due to the planting of cotton and oil crops by planting more potatoes, sweet potatoes, and other high-yield crops. To ensure the smooth completion of the entire production increase plan, the specific measures are as follows: (1) Solve the difficulties of labor and animal power. First, extensively organize labor mutual aid, and mobilize more than half of the women's full labor force in the entire region to participate in major agricultural labor. Second, greatly increase livestock. The plan stipulates that in the Wutai Mountain area, Shun Mountain area, Huo Mountain area, and Langxi area of ​​Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the masses should be organized to breed 242,000 head of livestock, and on this basis, strive to restore the number of draft animals to pre-war levels within five years. (2) Vigorously prevent and control floods, and expand the area of ​​irrigated land by 2 million mu through methods such as repairing water conservancy facilities, digging canals, and drilling wells. Public areas should repair and increase 66,000 new waterwheels to facilitate the development of water conservancy construction. (3) Organize farmers to increase fertilizer. This is one of the main conditions for achieving increased production requirements. In areas with a foundation for manure accumulation, fertilizer should be increased by 50% this year, and in areas with poorer conditions, it should be increased by 15%. To increase fertilizer, all localities should universally organize farmers to raise pigs and sheep. There are 1.5 million sheep in Taihang, Taiyue, and Beiyue. This year, this number should be increased to 2 million. (4) Local governments and farms should vigorously assist farmers in preventing and controlling pests and promote improved varieties. This year, we must ensure that there will be no large-scale locust plagues or other insect disasters. To this end, the plan stipulates that all localities should apply a large number of locally produced insecticides. This year, the entire North China region should promote the cultivation of 360,380 mu of improved varieties of wheat, Sizi cotton, and rice. (5) The entire region should help farmers increase the number of hammers, plows, hoes, and other agricultural tools by 4.15 million pieces, and universally establish agricultural tool repair stations to assist farmers in repairing agricultural tools, and further help farmers improve agricultural tools. (6) Expand the cultivated area. The entire region should eliminate 600,000 mu of wasteland. In mountainous areas, terracing is encouraged. In the barren areas of southern Hebei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and other plains, tractors are used to reclaim wasteland on a trial basis. In addition, the plan stipulates that local governments should mobilize farmers to vigorously plant trees and develop sideline production such as textiles, transportation, medicinal herb collection, mat weaving, and straw hat braiding.</p>
<p>This Year's Afforestation Plan</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the North China People's Government has formulated this year's afforestation plan for the entire North China region. The plan prepares to plant more than 24 million trees in the entire region, including the establishment of windbreak forest belts and universal afforestation in barren mountains and sandy wastelands, and prepare to establish more than 2,700 mu of nurseries to supply the seedlings needed for afforestation. In order to effectively complete the afforestation plan, the North China People's Government decided to set up a specialized organization to lead and manage forestry and issue forestry loans of 100 million yuan in Renminbi.</p>
<p>Hebei Central, Southern Hebei, Taihang and other places planted a large number of trees. Hebei Central and Taihang Administrative Offices have organized afforestation teams to various sandy areas, in cooperation with local party and government leading organs, to lead the masses in planting trees and afforestation, and plan to cultivate a large number of windbreak forests in the sandy areas of the Shahe River and Yongding River. Sixteen villages along the Shahe River in Xinle County, Hebei Central, planted 90,000 trees in the week from March 4th to 11th. Xizheng Village in Tang County, led by the village chief, primary school teachers and others, formed a forest protection committee to lead the village's afforestation and forest protection work, and led the planting of more than 3,200 trees on March 5th and 6th, forming three windbreak forest belts. The village has made a plan for afforestation in two seasons. Southern Hebei District specially stipulated March 16th to 22nd as the afforestation movement week. Yu Family Village, a village of 70 households in Yuanchao (newly established county, parts of Daming and Chaocheng) County in the district, planted 83,000 trees in sandy wasteland this spring. This year, afforestation in various places has generally corrected the shortcomings of the past, such as emphasizing collective afforestation, only planting trees without protecting them, and pursuing quantity regardless of the survival rate, and adopted the method of freely forming small groups to plant trees on their own land, so the enthusiasm of the masses for planting trees is very high.</p>
<p>Issuing Agricultural Loans</p>
<p>In order to encourage cotton planting, the Shijiazhuang City Supply and Marketing Cooperative specially issued cotton planting loans of 3.3 million yuan in Renminbi, and adopted the method of lending out real goods and repaying with real goods, that is, lending out seeds and fertilizers, and recovering seed cotton and lint. In the past half month, the cooperative has purchased more than 100,000 jin of cotton seeds and more than 480,000 jin of fertilizers, which will be distributed by the suburban supply and marketing cooperatives in the near future.</p>
<p>The branches and sub-branches of the Shandong Beihai Bank have recently decided to issue agricultural loans of more than 69.16 million jin of grain and 140 million yuan of Beihai currency to help farmers increase grain production and produce industrial raw materials. The Luzhongnan Branch of Beihai Bank stipulates that the issuance steps should be based on the production season, first issuing loans for agricultural tools and draught cattle to meet the needs of spring plowing, then issuing seed loans, and finally issuing loans for hoes and some seeds to solve the difficulties of hoeing and replanting. The branch also solved the problem of helping local cooperatives establish credit departments through the issuance of loans. The Bohai Administrative Office also issued instructions stipulating that loans should first be used to solve the difficulties of promoting the planting of cotton, peanuts, and other crops with fertilizers and seeds. The instructions from the Jiaodong Administrative Office specifically pointed out that when issuing draught cattle loans, the amount of loans must be controlled according to the amount of market sources to avoid panic purchases and stimulate price increases.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] The news that the People's Liberation Army had entered the urban area of ​​Greater Shanghai was quickly spread by the Shanghai Radio Station and the Triumph Radio Station yesterday morning, and all citizens immediately poured into the streets with excitement and joy to welcome them along the streets. This newspaper, Xinwen Bao, and Ta Kung Pao were still published as usual, and the "Shanghai People's" newspaper also published a special issue in the afternoon, which citizens rushed to buy and read. At noon, personnel from the Shanghai People's Organizations Federation told everyone on the street: "Shanghai has now been completely liberated. This is the beginning of our peaceful and prosperous life. We must end all chaos, quickly establish a revolutionary order, and celebrate heartily, and pay tribute to Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party who led our people to turn over." The citizens were all moved after hearing this. Then, they automatically tore off many slogans left by the Kuomintang on the walls, and enthusiastically took out boiling water and cigarettes to extend warm greetings to a group of People's Liberation Army soldiers resting by the roadside.</p>
<p>Vegetable Supply Abundant</p>
<p>Citizens who moved from Huxi, Xujiahui, Pudong, and Nanshi to the central district a few days ago began to carry their suitcases and move back yesterday. The refugees taken in by many Catholic groups were almost all gone. The three-wheeled vehicles were extremely busy operating back and forth, and the telephones were busy all day, mostly citizens inquiring about news. The vegetable supply at each small vegetable market in the morning was unusually abundant. Cabbage was sold for 500,000 yuan per catty. It is said that the source of vegetables will be more abundant starting today, and the price will also fall back. At about 2:00 p.m., the evening newspapers were also published. Because the sales were very good, each newspaper vendor asked for 7 million yuan.</p>
<p>Entertainment Venues Reopen Today</p>
<p>All cinemas, opera theaters, dance halls, and all entertainment venues were temporarily closed for one day yesterday and will all resume business today. Public transportation vehicles may also resume operation starting today. Most of the shops and roadside stalls had already resumed business as usual in the morning, but it is said that everyone was afraid that the gold yuan coupons would depreciate too much and suffer too much loss, so they temporarily closed again. Many retail stores probably needed cash, so the things they sold were cheaper than usual. A pack of white tin foil only cost 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>The past few days had been continuous rainy days, but yesterday the sky was high and the air was clear, and the weather was unusually sunny. Most parks were open for free, and many citizens took walks with a very leisurely attitude. Silver dollar transactions on the road resumed yesterday, and most of the sandbags on the street have been removed. There are many "voluntary police" without weapons near the Songshan Road Police Station, helping the People's Liberation Army maintain order.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] Before the People's Liberation Army arrived in the city, the ships of various shipping companies left on the Huangpu River received an order from the "Kyoto-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters" requiring them to sail out of the Wusongkou by 2:00 p.m. on the 20th to 7:00 p.m. on the 21st, otherwise they must be destroyed and sunk. At that time, China Oil Tanker Company had a total of nine oil tankers in Shanghai. Because they did not have time to sail out, four of them, "Yonghan", "Yonghuai", "Yongtao", and "Yongluo", were automatically sunk. There were also five ships, "Yongxiang", "Yonghuang", "Yongyu", "Yongwei", and "Yongxiao", that were not destroyed. In addition, the "Minben", "Minxiang", and "Minwan" ships of Minsheng Company, and the Jiangchang ship of the Dada Datong Joint Venture were also sunk at the bottom of the river.

The bureau's general manager Hu Shiyuan and deputy general managers Huang Muzong and Shen Zhongyi have not left Shanghai and are waiting for the People's Liberation Army to take over.

Although the shops had not yet opened, roadside stalls such as pancake, fried dough stick, tofu soup, and oil-fried vermicelli stalls were still set up as usual.</p>

<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] After the liberation of Shanghai, the valiant struggle of Shanghai workers has transitioned from underground to public. Workers from all sectors are faithfully implementing the New Democratic urban policies. The Shanghai Journalists' Union yesterday issued a public letter to the citizens as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai is liberated today! The heroic People's Liberation Army has officially entered the city! Six million people of Shanghai are now freed from the Kuomintang's brutal and reactionary rule. With boundless enthusiasm, we extend our highest respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!</p>
<p>The Kuomintang's reactionary regime is on the verge of total collapse, but Shanghai still harbors remnant armed forces and conspirators. We must unite all workers and the people of the city, heighten our vigilance, and thoroughly eradicate their poison. We must protect production machinery and strive for a new democratic society, preventing conspirators from sabotaging it.</p>
<p>Today is the first day of our liberation, and also the starting point of our dedication to the cause of liberation. We shout:</p>
<p>Long live the Communist Party of China!</p>
<p>Long live Chairman Mao!</p>
<p>Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!</p>
<p>Long live all commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army!</p>
<p>Long live the workers of Shanghai!</p>

<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Since the outbreak of war in the western district, residents originally living in areas such as Caohejing, Hongqiao, Qibao, and Tushanwan have mostly moved their families into the city, staying with relatives and friends. For a time, along Xuhui Road, people carrying suitcases and bundles, supporting the old and leading the young, were constantly on the move. However, since Shanghai was liberated yesterday, they have all been moving from east to west, returning to the suburbs, which is the opposite of the previous situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the war situation in Pudong was tense a few days ago, many residents fled to the city with the old and the young. Yesterday, after the liberation of Shanghai, the urban area and Pudong have become one. The Pudong refugees are all planning to return home. However, because the city ferry has not yet resumed, some people are hiring wooden boats to cross the river, valuing their homes after the disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Municipal Police Bureau Completed Takeover; Volunteer Police Assist in Maintaining Order <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau was taken over by Xu Xu, the principal of Daren Middle School, at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. The New City, Huangpu, Songshan, Changshu, Jiangning, and Putuo police sub-bureaus in the urban area were also taken over by the People's Liberation Army, which stationed troops for guard duty.</p>
<p>Acting Police Chief Lu Dagong, in addition to preparing for the handover at the headquarters yesterday morning, also did his best to maintain the city's public security. From 8:00 a.m. onwards, volunteer police in various districts continued to be dispatched to major thoroughfares to assist the People's Liberation Army in maintaining order.</p>

<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Yesterday, the grain market was still suspended. Retail prices were still stable. Some rice shops have resumed business, and ration rice is being sold as usual. Top-quality white rice is priced at 350 to 400 million per stone, "warship flour" is 90 million per bag, and soybean oil is 11 million per catty.</p>

<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] More than 300 students from Jiaotong, Tongji, Jinan, Fudan, and other universities who were arrested on the 26th of last month have been detained in Daren Middle School on Jianguo West Road for nearly a month. A few days ago, the Kuomintang military approved some parents to go through the procedures for bail. Yesterday morning, after the People's Liberation Army arrived in Shanghai, some of the detained students were released, but another group, it is said, was transported by truck to a certain place in Hongkou before the guarding military police withdrew. Currently, teachers and students of the respective schools and parents of the detained students are trying to find out their whereabouts.</p>

<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Since the liberation of Shanghai yesterday, according to Mr. Huang Zhenying, a member of the Shanghai Provisional Joint Relief Committee, the committee's relief work will continue. The defending troops in the Shanghai battle demolished many houses to construct fortifications in the suburbs, causing people to be displaced and seeking refuge in the city with the old and the young, a truly tragic sight. Therefore, the committee's relief work cannot be stopped abruptly. We still hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will support us to complete the task.</p>
<p>The executive committee, which meets every Wednesday and Saturday, was held as usual at 4:00 p.m. yesterday at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge, with most members attending. Furthermore, the medical and nursing team of the committee was officially established, and presidents of major hospitals in the city were invited to serve as members.

<h3 id="e68">Strange and Great Injustice: Details of the Zhang Kun Case in Chengdu; Like a Legendary Novel <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Chengdu News] The sensational Zhang Kun case in Chengdu has recently been finalized by the Chengdu District Court. This unprecedented "great injustice" in Sichuan involves Zhang Kun, the son of the deceased Kuomintang elder Zhang Puquan, who was murdered on the evening of February 2, 1945, near the Sima Bridge in the northern suburbs of Chengdu. At the time, the Sichuan Provincial Government mobilized hundreds of detectives and, after a thorough investigation, apprehended a group of perpetrators. From the occurrence of the case to the verdict, it took a full three years and six months, involving forty to fifty people. Due to the elusive and complex nature of the case, it is generally regarded as an unprecedented injustice in Sichuan's history of over a thousand years and is also recognized as the number one strange case since the founding of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Strange Case: Bizarre and Twisting Plot; Characters Encompassing Everything</p>
<p>This sensational national case involves love affairs, murder for money, and shady secrets. The characters involved include sons of important officials, politicians' wives, romantic maids, farmers, robbers, and more. The facts of the case are: Zhang Kun was the only son of Zhang Puquan. In 1944, he came to Chengdu for medical treatment for mental illness and stayed at the Municipal Mental Hospital. Coincidentally, Liu Shaoyu, a friend of the Zhang family, resided in a cemetery in the northern suburbs of Chengdu, and they became close. Later, when Liu went to Yunnan to mine, his wife, Liu Diaoshoumo, invited Zhang Kun to move to the cemetery for quiet recuperation. On the evening of February 2, 1945, Zhang went out to buy medicine. There was wind and snow all night, and the roads were muddy. Zhang did not return that night and was found murdered the next morning near the Sima Bridge, his body naked, in a truly tragic state. At the time, the Sichuan Provincial Government mobilized the Chengdu Municipal Government and the Chenghua County Government to conduct a large-scale investigation. After a month, they started the investigation from the clothing left behind by Zhang Kun before his death and apprehended suspects such as Qing Wanshun, He Zhanchun, Wu Daxing, Chen Xiaofan, Zeng Ruiping, Ren Hongxing, Ren Wangshi, and Chen Junzhi, who was accused of instigating the crime. They were interrogated successively by the Chengdu County Government and the Chengdu Municipal District Court. It took three and a half years to reach a final verdict.</p>
<p>The Facts of the Case: Conspiring to Murder for Money; Court Hearings Published</p>
<p>There are two different versions of the true circumstances of the case. One is based on the official court hearing and verdict: Zhang Yin resided in the Art Garden, while Ren Hongxing and others lived together in a thatched cottage near Sima Bridge, within sight of each other. Zhang often went out for walks, dressed impeccably, which aroused the greed of Ren and others. On the evening when Zhang went out to buy medicine, Ren, He, and Qing discovered this. They invited Wu Daxing to jointly ambush him on the road. They broke Zhang's eardrums, causing him to faint, and robbed him of all his clothing and divided it among themselves. Zhang gradually woke up, but because it was dark, he could not find his way home. Seeing the lights in Ren's thatched cottage, he went to beg for fire to warm himself. Qing Wanshun and others heard the noise and went outside, saw that Zhang had woken up, and struck him again on the head with a bamboo tube for blowing fire, and pushed him into a ditch next to the house. Zhang died from serious injuries and the extreme cold in the wheat field about ten feet away from Ren's cottage. After investigation by the detective team, Zhang Kun's clothing was found in a pile of thatch behind Ren's house. Following this clue, Ren Hongxing and his wife were arrested. After several interrogations, all relevant perpetrators were arrested. Another love affair was involved: Hu Guihong, a maid in Liu's residence, had been promised to Chen Junzhi by Liu Shaoyu. Zhang lived in Liu's residence and gradually developed a relationship with Guihong. It is said that Chen harbored deep jealousy. Because Zhang died a violent death, Chen was charged with instigating murder and imprisoned.</p>
<p>A Great Injustice: A Scandalous Case; Social Legends Such As This</p>
<p>However, another version of the facts is circulating in society. It is said that Zhang Li was inherently fond of romance. Liu Diaoshoumo was past her prime but still beautiful. The pretty maid Guihong was small and charming. Zhang's residence in the Art Garden was actually a "gentle village," where he indulged in lust and excessive dissipation, and the real cause of death was "yang depletion." After his death, someone took advantage of the situation to shift the blame. In the dark of night, Ren Hongxing was abandoned in the wheat field. Ren and other ignorant villagers stripped Zhang of his clothes (or it is said that Zhang's clothes were placed behind Ren's cottage by a servant from Liu's residence). After Ren and others were arrested, Liu's residence used 20 mu of paddy fields to buy Qing Wanshun, who testified that he conspired with Ren and others to murder Zhang Kun (Qing revealed this truth when he died in prison on October 24, 1945). Chen Junzhi was a businessman in the Rongqunce Company in Chengdu and was admired by Liu Shaoyu, who promised to marry Guihong to him, inducing him to call her a foster daughter. However, Chen later found out that Guihong was actually a maid and learned that she had an affair with Zhang. He resolutely refused to marry her. After Zhang's death, because Liu and Hu blamed Chen for refusing the marriage, they accused Chen of instigating murder. This is the true story that has been consistently identified in Chengdu's street gossip and various magazines over the years. Society in particular vividly confirmed it and was dissatisfied with the court's verdict, considering it an unprecedented great injustice. The Sichuan Provincial Assembly specially requested relevant agencies to investigate, and these "criminals" who were sentenced received widespread sympathy from the entire Sichuan society. The court also examined Guihong and found that she was still a virgin, ultimately using a "trumped-up charge."</p>
<p>This unprecedented strange case went from the District Court to the High Court to the Supreme Court, lasting three years and six months. The main culprit, Qing Wanshun, died in prison in the winter of 1945. Wu Daxing, Ren Hongxing, and He Zhanchun were each sentenced to ten years of imprisonment after a retrial on November 28, 1946. Chen Xiaofan and Cao Ruiping were found not guilty. Until July 27 of last year, Ren Wangshi and Chen Junzhi's cases were retried. The result was that Ren Wangshi's sentence was reduced to four years of imprisonment, and Chen Junzhi was found not guilty. This sensational national case came to a formal end.</p>
<p>Citizens Gather to View the Eight Rules of the People's Liberation Army (Photo by This Newspaper)</p>
<h3 id="e69">From City Markets to Street Stalls <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Special Feature by This Newspaper] "Shanghai Beach" - seeing the situation on the streets in the days before liberation, it should be interpreted as "Shanghai Stall," which is the most primitive form of transaction, and is also the street scene seen a few days ago. Since the People's Liberation Army entered the city yesterday morning and people's hearts have stabilized, shops, fearing the devaluation of the gold yuan notes, have generally suspended business, and street stalls have also temporarily disappeared. However, all shops, in accordance with the resolution of the Security Committee, will resume business as usual today. It is believed that the street stalls on both sides of the roads will also become lively again. Now, let us record the history of street stalls below to share with our readers:</p>
<p>"Trading at noon" was the trading method in ancient times, and Shanghai was certainly no exception. From Shanghai's literature, we cannot find records of market-style transactions; however, some traces of this primitive transaction have been left behind. The drama meeting during the Buddha's Birthday celebration near Jing'an Temple still has the form of a market.</p>
<p>The Annual Buddha's Birthday Celebration: Numerous Stalls Line the Streets Near Jing'an Temple</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple, among the temples in Shanghai, is also considered a famous temple, and it also has much value worth studying in history. On the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, the Buddha's Birthday celebration, Jing'an Temple usually has an annual festival, with incense burning and numerous visitors. In this lively occasion, many merchants seized the opportunity to sell goods. Near the temple, numerous stalls lined the streets, conducting transactions with pilgrims and tourists. Although they were small daily necessities, with many people and many stalls, the total number of transactions was not small! The opening and expansion of the concessions, with smooth asphalt roads extending from the Bund to Jing'an Temple, made transportation to Jing'an Temple even more convenient. Although Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road have many shops, the annual Buddha's Birthday celebration has not diminished.</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple fair starts from the beginning of the fourth lunar month and lasts until after the tenth, which is the market fair period. Starting from Hart Road, along Jing'an Temple Road, extending to the west of Ditihui Road. Jessfield Road and Haig Road, north to Xinzha Road, south to Avenue Foch, and Yuyuan Road and Wuzhou Road behind the temple are also places for stalls. Reed mats and cloth tents are stretched densely, covering the early summer sun. The goods sold at the stalls include woodenware, rattanware, bamboo ware, pottery, steel implements, etc., most of which are handmade products. Exquisite embroidery, brocade weaving, and fine bamboo items are also displayed. New machine-made products are also sold, such as fabrics, socks, and cosmetics, but the quality is not as good as those in the shops. In the open space, there are also magic shows, strange people and beasts, and peep shows, with flags flying and iron pots being beaten to attract customers.</p>
<p>Special Areas in the Concession Era: Displaying Used Goods of All Kinds</p>
<p>Primitive markets are all connected with temples. The Jing'an Temple fair is only once a year, but the City God Temple is surrounded by many stalls all year round. Many small shops in the temple now are the development of stalls. Fake jewelry, toys, children's shoes and hats, flowers and plants, antiques, etc., and food stalls are particularly numerous. Squid, duck blood, Nanxiang steamed buns, and glutinous rice balls in fermented rice wine are all very famous. In addition, fortune tellers are also an indispensable embellishment in temple fairs. The City God Temple is also unique in this regard. Although the City God Temple often has markets, it is even more lively during festivals. The most lively day is the half-night of New Year's Eve. Devotees rush to burn the first incense, with shoulders rubbing against each other, blocking the road. Snack stalls and incense candle shops have particularly prosperous business, and fortune telling business is also very booming. Many people want to ask about their fortunes in the coming year.</p>
<p>In the concession era, setting up stalls arbitrarily on the streets was not allowed, but there were still stalls. Usually, they were under the gatehouses of alleyways, and some were openly set up on the streets, which were special areas, and the goods sold were also special. The North Gate's Haichang Road and the former French Concession's Avenue Frelupt, etc., were the places where stalls were concentrated. There, clothes, hats, washbasins, pots, hardware, alarm clocks, furniture, all kinds of things were available, only they were used. Many of these things were discarded by wealthy families after they were used, and some were of unknown origin. On both sides, there were also rag shops, grocery stores, and teahouses. People on the road carried burdens, held packages, and carried boxes, all coming to the market. Because they were used goods, customers were also limited to the poor. If one has a sharp eye, one can buy cheap goods there, but if one does not know the goods, one may buy them more expensively than new ones, and sometimes one may buy slippery goods. On Rue Paul Henry, there were also many street performers participating. Fortune tellers, dentists with large umbrellas, and performers singing ballads and telling stories embellished this market even more.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Restrictions and High Prices of American Goods: The Golden Age Gradually Passes</p>
<p>In recent times, the street stalls in the Qiujiang Road after the victory can be promoted. People who want to find cheap goods all ran there. On the ruins burned by the war, it suddenly became a bustling market. When the victory firecrackers awakened the Japanese invaders' dreams, Japanese expatriates sold their furniture, utensils, and clothing, preparing to be sent back to their country. The furniture was very small, and it was very suitable for use in Shanghai, where land is worth a fortune. Tea sets, wine utensils, and exquisite small decorations were all very interesting. The most noticeable were the colorful ribbons on the backs of Japanese women, colorful and dazzling, and also strips of bundles.</p>
<p>Following Qiujiang Road, it was the American goods market. From the Pearl Harbor incident to the victory, Shanghai had not received any American goods for four years. After the victory, American goods came in abundance, and they felt particularly close, as if long-separated lovers had met again. The center of the American goods market was on Zhubaoshan Road, selling mostly surplus military supplies, as well as goods imported by formal merchants, but also backdoor goods secretly sold by American soldiers or warships. At that time, American goods were extremely cheap. Almost everyone had one or two American-style equipment, glass belts, sunglasses, Kning milk powder, and Chester cigarettes, which became the most common supplies. Although the concentration of American goods was on Zhubaoshan Road, the stalls spread throughout the city. Whether on busy or remote roads, there were traces of stalls. At this time, the prohibition of stalls along the road caused a great uproar. Later, the stallholders moved their positions and changed to setting up joint shopping malls, but their golden age had passed. Gradually, due to foreign exchange restrictions, the selling price of American goods became higher and higher, and there were no more large sales.</p>
<p>Eager to Cash Out: Selling on the Streets</p>
<p>Recently, street stalls have reappeared on the streets of Shanghai, and the situation looks very lively, but compared with the past American goods stalls, they cannot be compared. The emergence of these stalls is mostly due to the blockage of factory sales, the inflexible turnover of the economy, and the inability to pay severance fees after dissolution. Therefore, the goods were distributed to the employees, and in order to make a living, the employees took the goods and sold them on the streets to cash them out quickly. Many shops, which originally had very little business, also took advantage of this opportunity to distribute some goods and asked their employees to set up stalls. The stalls mostly sell light industrial products, such as towels, sheets, clothing materials, pots, and thermos bottles. The prices are also very cheap, but the transactions are very quiet. Although there are many people around the stalls, there are few real buyers. The appearance of these many stalls also indicates the withering of industry and commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Under the New Democratic Economic System, Private Banks Still Have a Way Out: Assisting National Banks in Developing Production <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Do private banks have a way out in the society under the New Democratic economic system? A reporter interviewed several bankers who have a better understanding of the New Democratic economy. According to the discussion: "In the new economic system, private banks have a way out. This way is not to help speculative merchants, raise prices, and exploit the people, but to help production, enrich social wealth, and let everyone have food and clothing. This road is healthy and easy to walk because there are national banks leading the way. The business of national banks is to help state-owned or larger enterprises. Private banks have less power, so they can help small-scale or even handicraft producers. In other words, private banks can assist national banks in supporting production organizations and producers that national banks do not have time to take care of. Based on this principle, private banks should always check whether the loans of their customers are really used for production and must thoroughly prevent them from going the way of commercial speculation. At first, there may be difficulties in attracting deposits, but after helping producers increase production, a normal and close relationship can definitely be established, developing production and prospering the economy, and the bad effects of the past will no longer occur."</p>
