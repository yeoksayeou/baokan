<h3 id="c1">政府拒絕中共要求　仍盼先停戰再和談　覆文由在平代表團轉致　吳鐵城黃紹竑飛穗張羣赴溪口報告 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕政府決定拒絕中共所提和平協定八條廿四款答覆之電文，已於廿日午自京以電報傳達在平之政府和談代表團，並屬於即晚由張治中送致中共代表團，目前和談之成敗，將視中共對比答覆之反應如何而定。政府所提之答覆，係對中共廿四條款作整個答覆，而非逐條答覆。電文要點指出：（一）中共條款之基本精神不平等·不合理，非和談態度，政府不能接受。（二）請中共本人民利益之前提，重新考慮態度，先行停戰，再繼續和談，全文甚長，首段敘述政府委曲求全，忍讓謀和之苦心，並說明八年抗戰以來人民所遭遇之痛苦甚深，亟盼和平之到來，蔣總統隱退亦爲誠意謀和之表現。繼稱：中共所提草案，乃係對被征服者之態度，尤以指定廿日簽字，無異最後通牒，各項條款有如對政府下一判決，政府無法執行，其後果亦不堪設想，勢必引起更大之戰爭，國家民族將遭受悲慘之命運。所指整編軍隊，實爲消滅國軍之謂，如若實施，則將引起軍民之激憤，國家財富，人民財產均將遭遇浩刦。聯合政府由中共指定人選，無異使政府投降繳械，政府固不惜委曲求全，但全國軍民實不能接受，故盼中共重新考慮改變態度。電文中更指出連日共軍在江北普遍攻擊，尤足妨礙和談，盼望雙方能先簽訂停戰協定，再繼續和談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕政府發言人廿日深夜就政府向中共提出答覆一點，發表談話如次：「政府對中共所提條款，廿日下午已正式答覆，希望中共方面以平等的精神，考慮我們答覆的內容並盼先成立一臨時的停戰協定，然後從長計議」。發言人稱：政府答覆電文，係由李代總統及何應欽院長會同簽署，於廿日下午電達張治中轉致中共。</p>

<p>〔中央社廣州廿日電〕政府和談代表團與中共代表團在北平開始和談後，中共代表團曾向政府代表團提出所謂「國內和平協定」，茲探錄全文如下：</p>
<h3 id="c4">國內和平協定 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>中華民國卅五年南京國民政府在美國政府幫助之下違背人民意志，破壞停戰協定及政治協商會議的決議，在反對中國共產黨名義之下，向中國人民及中國人民解放軍發動全國規模的國內戰爭。此項戰爭，至今已達兩年又九個半月之久，全國人民因此蒙受了極大的災難，國家財力·物力遭受了極大的損失，國家主權亦遭受了極大的損害，全國人民對南京國民政府違背孫中山先生的革命三民主義的立場，違背孫中山先生的聯俄聯共及扶助農工等項正確的政策，以及違背孫中山先生的革命的臨終遺囑，歷來表示不滿，全國人民對於南京國民政府發動此次空前規模的國內戰爭，以及由此而採取的政治·軍事·財政·經濟·文化·外交等項錯誤的政策及措施，尤其表示反對。南京國民政府在全國人民中，業已完全喪失信任，而在此次國內戰爭中，南京國民政府的軍隊，業已爲中國共產黨所領導爲中國人民革命軍事委員會所指揮的人民解放軍所戰敗。基於上述情況，南京國民政府曾於中華民國三十八年一月一日向中國共產黨提議，舉行停止國內戰爭，恢復和平狀態的談判，中國共產黨曾於同年一月十四日發表聲明，同意南京國民政府上項提議，並提議以懲辦戰爭罪犯，廢除僞憲法，廢除僞法統，依據民主原則，改編一切反動軍隊，沒收官僚資本，實行土地改革，廢除賣國條約，召集沒有反動份子參加的新的政治協商會議，成立民主聯合政府，接收南京國民黨反動政府及其所屬各級政府的一切權力等八項條件，爲雙方舉行和平談判的基礎。此八項基礎條件，已爲南京國民政府所同意，因此，中國共產黨方面和南京政府方面派遣自己的代表團，授以舉行談判和簽訂協定的全權，雙方代表於北平集會，首先確認南京國民政府應對於此次國內戰爭及其各項錯誤政策，担負全部責任，並同意成立本協定。</p>
<p>第一條第一款爲着分清是非，判明責任，中國共產黨代表團與南京國民政府代表團雙方（以下簡稱雙方）確認對於發動及執行此次國內戰爭應負責任的南京國民政府方面的戰爭罪犯原則上必須予以懲辦，但得依照下列情形分別處理，第一項，一切戰犯不問何人，如能認清是非，翻然悔悟，出於眞心實意，確有事實表現，因而有利於中國人民解放事業之推進，有利於用和平方法解決國內問題者，准予取銷戰犯罪名，給以寬大待遇，第二項，一切戰犯不問何人，凡屬怙惡不悛，阻碍人民解放事業之推進，不利於用和平方法解決國內問題或竟策動叛亂者，應予從嚴懲辦，其率隊叛亂者，應由中國人民革命軍事委員會負責予以討平。第二款，雙方確認南京國民政府於中華民國三十八年一月廿六日將日本侵華戰爭罪犯岡材寗次大將宣告無罪釋放，復於同年一月卅一日允許其他日本等項處置是錯誤的，此項日本戰犯一俟中國民主聯合政府即代表全中國人民的新的中央政府成立，即應從新處理。</p>
<p>第二條第三款雙方確認南京國民政府於中華民國三十五年十一月召開的「國民代表大會」所通過的「中華民國憲法」應予廢除。第四款「中華民國憲法」廢除後，中國國家及人民所當遵循的根本法，應依新的政治協商會議及民主聯合政府的決議行之。</p>
<p>第三條第五款雙方確認南京國民政府的一切法統應予廢除。第六款在人民解放軍到達和接收的地區及在民主聯合政府成立以後，應即建立人民的民主的法統，並廢止一切反動法令。</p>
<p>第四條第七款雙方確認南京國民政府所屬的一切武裝力量（一切陸軍·海軍·空軍·憲兵部隊，交通警察部隊，地方部隊，一切軍事機關·學校·工廠及後方後勤機構等），均應依照民主原則，實行改編爲人民解放軍，在國內和平協定簽字之後，應立即成立一個全國性的整編委員會，負責此項改編工作，整編委員會委員爲七人至九人，由人民革命軍事委員會派出四人至五人，南京國民政府派出三人至四人，以一人爲主任，南京國民政府派出之委員一人爲副主任，在人民解放軍到達和接收的地區，得依需要設立區域性的整編委員會分會。此項分會雙方人數的比例及主任·副主任的分擔，同於全國性的整編委員會，海軍及空軍的改編，應各設一個整編委員會，人民解放軍向南京國民政府現時所轄地區開進和接收的一切事宜，由中國人民革命軍事委員會以命令規定之。人民解放軍開進時，南京國民政府所屬武裝部隊不得抵抗。第八款雙方同意每一區域的改編計劃分爲兩個階段進行，第一項第一階段爲集中整理階段，第一點凡南京國民政府所屬的一切武裝部隊（陸軍·海軍·空軍·憲兵·交通警察總隊及地方部隊等）均應集中整理，整理原則應由整編委員會根據各區實况，在人民解放軍到達和接收的地區，按照其原番號，原編制，原人數，命令其分區，分期開赴指定地點集中整理；第二點南京國民政府所屬一切武裝部隊，在其駐在的大小城市·交通要道·河流·海港及鄉村，當人民解放軍尚未到達和接收前，應負責維持當地秩序，防止任何破壞事件發生；第三點在上述地區當人民解放軍到達和接收時，南京國民政府所屬武裝部隊，應根據整編委員會及其分會的命令，實行和平移交，開赴指定地點，在開赴指定地點的行進中及到達後，南京國民政府所屬武裝部隊應嚴格遵守紀律，不得破壞地方秩序；第四點在南京國民政府所屬武裝部隊遵照整編委員會及其分會的命令離開原駐地時，原在當地駐守的地方警察或保安部隊不得撤走，並應負責維持地方治安，接受人民解放軍的指揮和命令；第五點南京國民政府所屬一切武裝部隊，在開動與集中期間，其糧秣被服及其他軍需供給，統由整編委員會及其分會和地方政府負責解決；第六點南京國民政府所屬一切軍事機關（從國防部直到聯合後方勤務總司令部所屬的機關·學校·工廠·倉庫等），一切軍事設備（軍港要塞空軍基地等）及一切軍用物資，應由整編委員會及其分會根據各區實現，命令其分區分期移交給人民解放軍及其各地軍事管制委員會接收。第二項第二階段爲分區改編階段，第一點南京國民政府所屬陸軍部隊（步兵部隊，騎兵部隊，特種兵部隊，憲兵部隊，交通警察部隊及地方部隊）在分區開赴指定地點集中整理後，整編委員會應根據各區實况，製出分區改編計劃，定期實施改編，原則應依照人民解放軍的民主制度和正規編制，將經過集中整理的上述全部陸軍部隊編成人民解放軍的正規部隊，其士兵中老弱殘廢經查騐屬實，確須退伍，並自願退伍者，其官佐中自願退役或轉業者，（下文轉入第二版）</p>

<p>〔本報新鄉廿日電〕和談聲中，共軍突以重兵向豫北安陽進犯，已引起豫北人民憤慨。據估計。落入安陽城內砲彈，最低亦在五百發以上。迄廿日止，保衛戰已進入第三日，林彪部四十二軍三四·一二五·一一六·一四六師，附砲兵一個團，約四萬餘，重機槍四，小砲四，步槍七十枝。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕行政院長何應欽，廿日下午四時一刻出席立院，報告北平和談經過，中共要求及政府之答覆，歷一小時始畢。中共所提和平協定草案之序言與八條廿四款以及政府廿日答覆中共之電文，均經何氏在會中宣讀。何氏首稱：政府爲促進和平，故派和談代表團赴平，與中共代表進行商談，自四月一日至十二日，其間幾經波折，尤以九日幾告破裂，嗣經與毛澤東氏直接商談，始告轉圜，繼續進行。十三日舉行正式會議，中共即提出和平協定草案八條廿四款，政府代表團認為須向中央請示始能決定，當即派代表黃紹竑，顧問屈武將和平協定草案　返，由政府研討對策。何氏結論稱：中共所提條件，已失基於平等之和平方案，似爲戰勝者對被征服之對象而定，故政府無法接受，已於廿日下午將覆文電告在平之政府代表，轉達中共。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕中共當局在尚未獲得政府對中共要求之答覆前，廿日下午聞已發動江北全綫之總攻擊，隆隆砲聲已衝入和平空氣之首都市區。政府頃已決定於廿一日舉行重要會議，決定遷移與應戰等重要決策。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕記者獲悉中共於廿日夜下總攻擊令後，廿一日零時十分與軍方某高級將領通話，據談：江北方面西起安慶，經二壩·裕溪口·西梁山·江浦·花旗營·十二圩·至瓜洲等橋頭陣地，廿日夜起，已先後發生戰事，其間尤以裕溪口·江浦·十二圩戰事最烈，國軍陣地無變化。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕和談不絕如縷聲中，首都對岸於廿日傍晚起又傳來隆隆砲聲。記者站於馥記大樓崖頂平台，且可遙見砲彈射出時成弧形之白光，此起彼落，首都居民因此一度又呈緊張。據記者向軍方探悉：此乃係陳毅卅五軍吳化文部之兩個團，於今晚起，自全椒東南湯泉鎮，劉莊一帶分兩路向江浦城橋頭堡猛犯，經國軍劉秉哲部還擊，同時空軍多架冒黑夜出動投彈，海軍亦自江面砲擊助戰後，迄廿日晚十時，戰事仍在城郊二三華里處繼續中。</p>
<p>〔又電〕江浦戰事廿一日晨一時許已移至城外二三百公尺處，來犯之共軍不斷增加，守軍雖衆寡懸殊，但仍以無比英勇，在海空配合下奮勇阻擊中。此間今澈夜砲聲未絕。</p>

<h3 id="c22">人民將何以自救？ <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>政府昨天已如限答復中共的最後通牒，要求中共為人民的利益計，重行考慮態度，修改其所謂「國內和平協定」的八條二十四款。同時，國民黨中央執行委員會也發表其對於此項條款的鄭重聲明，說明歷年戰爭責任之所在，要求此時先行停戰，並由中央修改條款，以利和談之進行。可見政府和國民黨還是切望和談之門不閉，而中國大局之為和為戰，依然繋於中共一念之間。</p>
<p>中共的八條二十四款，昨晚已由政府正式公布，內容是否苛酷，有目共見。一般人所要問的：政府既稱中共條款為不平等，不合理，絕非和談態度，請中共重新考慮，並先行停戰，則中共究將何以為繼？其實，照昨天的情勢看，可以預測中共必將加強其攻勢，作渡江的一逞。我們所要問的，已不是中共是否居心進攻，也不是政府時候應戰，而是人民自己如何發揮他們的力量以自救？</p>
<p>中共口口聲聲，無不以「解放」人民為號召，則今日人民所最痛苦者，當無過於戰爭，亦即其所最需「解放」者無過於戰爭的痛苦，而何以和談已達兩旬，共軍發動渡江的砲火不但始終未停，莤且日益熾烈？豈必如此，始可稱為「解放」人民？當三十四年冬政治協商會議將開會時，中共代表周恩來堅持必須先下令停戰，否則即為並無和平誠意，因而國民政府於三十五年　月十日頒發停戰令，使政協會議終於獲得結果。（後來中共又不履行政協決議，那是另一回事。）何以此次和談開始之前，政府屢次請先停戰，而中共迄未理會，反將大隊人馬，從華北源源南下，準備大舉渡江？難道這大舉進攻就是和平的象徵？中共在八條廿四款之前，有長達千言的序文，痛詆國民黨。課以戰爭的罪責。我們不愿為國民黨辯護，也姑不論戰爭的責任屬諸何方的問題，而今天還不肯停戰的責任却顯然屬於中共一方面，雖有百口，無以自解。這又豈不是中共恃勝而驕，以戰爭為兒戲；又幾回見他們眞正顧及人民的痛苦？</p>
<p>中共既不以人民的痛苦為念，已在江北沿岸作渡江的攻擊，則今日之事，中共為挑戰，而政府將為被迫的應戰。這三個半月以來，全國人民所曉莤堵口以呼籲的和平，蔣總統李代總統所不惜引退忍辱以求取的和平，終於為中共昨天的隆隆大炮熊熊戰火所摧毀，蔣總統元且文告所啟導的祥和之氣，使我們人民只落得一個和平的幻夢。誰是專求和平者？誰是破壞和平者？至此，更不難得一顯著的證明，以前也許還有人以為政府的誠意不够，然如李代總統這樣忍氣吞聲卑躬屈節的向中共呼籲，總不能再說政府求取和平的誠意不够了吧；然而，會不足以動中共趾高氣揚者之　顧。連李代總統何院長以及和平問題委員會各委員，都認為中共所提的不是和平條款，而是戰勝者對被征服者之判決書，則我們人民對於那些不給我們和平的中共好戰份子，果將何以自救呢？</p>
<p>老實說罷，中共的最後通牒，所調八條廿四款，不能算是和平協定，也不僅是對政府和國民黨的判決書，乃是對於中華民國和四萬萬五千萬國民的處分書。它要把八年抗戰捍衛國家的海陸空軍，盡數繳械而改編為崇拜馬列史主義的共軍；它要組織一個由中共一手控制的聯合政府。而一概廢棄以前所有的法律包括中華民國憲法在內；它要沒收一切規模較大的工廠，而清算人民所有若干數額以上的財產；它要接收政府有關的一切機構，而使服務人員一概領受共產主義的思想訓練；它指責戰時戰後助我最多的盟邦美國，而要用廢除「賣國條約」的方法，隔斷中美間的友誼關係，使中國今後孤立而無援。總之，中共這一個通牒，如果政府被迫而令其和平代表簽字于其上，則中國勢必變成一個紅軍支持下的共產主義國家，而被關閉於鐵幕之內。國家獨立，人民自由，將盡為此一紙協定而斷送於不知不覺之中。幸而政府當局具有負責人的勇氣，爲國家人民的久遠利害打算，不肯貿然簽字，而要求中共改變其態度，遂得保留吾國家和人民之一綫生機。</p>
<p>所以，政府今後設果不得已而應戰，乃是為國家的獨立而戰，偉人民的自由而戰，也是為我們所蔪求的眞正的永久的和平而戰。這個不得已的應戰，有關於人民的利害者很大，我們人民斷無袖手旁觀之理，尤其愛好和平自由的人民更無痛癢不關之理。然則，戰火一且延及長江兩岸，我們人民應該怎樣奮起自救呢？北平優一個十二三歲的小學生，前幾天寫信給他住在上海的爸爸，說現在想要等一間可吸自由空氣的小房間而不可得！我們要自由嗎？其速自救！</p>

<p>十七國贊成西倫尼加交英託管，義屬索瑪里蘭則根據託管協定交還義國治理。十二國主張的黎波里坦尼亞交義國治理，十國贊成由法國治理里比亞之费森區。又大多數國均主張將伊里特利亞之一部劃讓阿比西尼亞，使其獲得出海口。一般而論，聯大政委會就義殖民地問題之意見，可分兩派，一派主張將各殖民地一律交聯合國託管，一派則主張個別託管。第一派以印度蘇聯及阿拉伯國家為主，共計有十八單位。此數雖不能使其主張通過，但已足可阻止另一派之獲得三分之二之多數以便使該派之建議成立。</p>

<h3 id="c56">工資研究會商定　指數仍公布兩次　依銀元市價折發　將提勞資評斷委員會再行討論 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>經濟會報工資研究會，於昨日下午二時，在市府會議室舉行，由陳秘書長主席。首由社會局長曹沛滋報告工資研究結果辦法六項，提付討論，計：（一）依銀元計值，折發工資，以「八一九」限價時工人底薪打對折，再按當時銀元市價，發放工資，而取消生活費指數。（二）依每半月生活費指數公佈時之銀元價格折發金圓劵。（三）每月公佈生活費指數二次，每逢八日照上月底指數發一日至七日工資，同時預支八日至十五日工資；廿三日照十五日公佈之生活費指數發十六日至廿二日工資，預支廿三日至月底工資；至月半月底指數發表時補足。（四）參照現行公用事業發薪辦法，每月五日根據上月底指數發一日至十五日半個月，二十日照十五日公佈之指數發一個月，俟三十日指數公佈，扣還五日所借半月工資。（五）實行週薪制，指數每週發表一次，每週發薪。（六）以實物抵作工資。曹氏對於以上各項辦法，認爲銀元計值，統一價格如何取得，工資依銀元計算，商品是否亦以銀元標價，均應請考慮。次由總工會代表周學湘提出三項發薪原則：（一）底薪折半發銀元，在銀元價格不統一前，以袁頭作標準。（二）備有銀元者發銀元，無銀元者折發金圓劵，職工不得拒絕。（三）各公司工廠可自定日期發薪，以免發薪日影響物價。繼由潘士浩·田和卿·陸京士·嚴諤聲等相繼發表意見。末由陳秘書長歸納一般意見後，決定暫時採用曹局長報告之第二項辦法，卽生活指數仍每月發表兩次，工資依指數發表時之銀元價格折發金圓券。惟周學湘復提出意見，要求指數採用之物價，須按半月中最高市價計算，如不採納，總工會將拒絕派員參加有關此一問題之會議。後決定將此項討論結果，提交勞資評斷委會決定；總工會及市商會·市工業會等意見，一併送勞資評斷委會核議。至四時散會。</p>

<p>上海市總工會昨日上午十時，召開第三次常務理監事會議，出席周學湘·孫文元·仇長江·黃悅祥·方如升·葉翔臯等，主席周學湘，重要議決案如下：（一）解救當前職工生活威脅辦法：一，職工薪金依照金圓劵底薪折半，依照銀元發給（在銀元未統一價格前，以袁洋計算之）。二，各廠發薪，資方如無足夠銀元，應依照當日售出市價，折發金圓劵，職工不得拒受。三，職工薪金，應分業分日發給，以避免鈔荒，及搶購現象，刺激物價上漲，但勞資雙方原有發薪日期協定，不得隨意變更。四，週薪制實行後，按月第一第三兩期工資，應作爲預支數，在第二第四期工資內結清之。（二）梁秘書長永章出國參加亞勞會，秘書長一職，由孫副秘書長文元暫代。（三）梁永章·水祥雲出國參加亞勞會，勞資評斷會委員一缺，暫由孫文元·方如升代表出席會議。</p>
<p>另訊：總工會代表周學湘，方如升，孫文元，黃悅祥，昨爲出席市府工資問題會議聯名發表共同聲明如下：「自金圓劵貶值，物價瘋狂上漲以來，平均計算之生活費指數，與實際物價相去甚遠，不能據爲發放工薪之標準，已爲不可否認之事實。本會據各業工會代表紛紛來會，要求照金元底薪折半以銀元價值折發工薪，實爲一勞永逸之根本辦法，節經向市政府當局提出建議，連日會商結果，各方僉認照銀元價值折發工薪，確有此必要，但在未實行以前，亟需有一過渡辦法，本日市府重行召集工業會，商會及本會代表舉行會議（中略）。陳代市長規定之辦法，在保持生活指數發表後之幣值而言，不無裨益，但對於各方迫切重視之指數，如何接近物價一點，仍未解決。故陳代市長所提一節，同人等可表接受外，對指數之編製，必須達成本會歷次提出之每期中最高物價，作爲計薪指數後，才算合理解決，否則，該項決定同人等旣未參予表决，自難負其責任。總之，同人等實因本案關係太鉅，並非堅持成見，心所謂危，不敢草率從事，誠恐各界不明眞相，特此共同聲明。」</p>

<p>〔中央社訊〕國民黨上海市黨部爲擁護國民黨中執會五項原則聲明起見，昨（廿日）通電全國，表示如下：</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部部長孫越崎，昨下午四時在紡聯會招待本市工商各界領袖，聽取各方意見，俾爲施政之參考，茶會在融洽之空氣中，談至七時許始散。</p>
<p>招待會開始，孫部長先起立致詞，略謂：自政府發表渠爲經濟部長後，因候該部組織決定，故至今方克來滬。今願借此機會，請教諸位對工商經濟之高見。如各位有須政府幫助之處，政府決盡力爲之。惟各位有能力協助政府，亦請多方指教。年來之經濟·金融，未能配合，故甚望以後經濟，財政，及勞工各方面均能面面配合，相互瞭解。處茲局面下，本人能做到幾分，卽做幾分，終望能多多减輕各業之痛苦。本人現擬在經濟部內設一民營工業顧問委員會，請工商各界領袖參加，俾對許多施策，能多多徵求大家意見，能辦者卽付實施。現願請教諸位多多發表高見。</p>
<p>旋劉鴻生，徐寄廎，王曉籟，駱清華，金潤庠，劉广一，潘士浩，謝天沙，田和卿，王先青，劉靖基，壽景偉等就各業痛苦，分陳意見，並請孫部長設法解決。</p>
<p>燃煤供應問題　已可暫告解決</p>
<p>最後由孫部長歸納作一結論，茲分誌如次：（一）繅絲業之貸款，時機迫促萬分，設若過遲，繭生蛾後，卽已無法挽救，對於此事，請繅絲業方面先擬一具體之意見，召集同業領袖，於明日（指廿一日）上午十時在禮查飯店四樓經濟部滬處，由經次簡貫三主持，召開一談話會，工商解決辦法。（二）茶貸之事，亦望茶業領袖提一切實可行之辦法，於明日（廿一日）下午三時在同址與經次簡貫三洽商解決辦法。（三）燃煤問題：去年十一月起，本人接管烟煤調節委員事務，會務推進，純係代人服務，決不自做買賣。出長經濟部後，當亦一本此旨做事。現煤的問題，已可暫告解決，因藥煤已洽妥五萬噸。對自備外匯用以購煤者，已洽准儘量開放，並請豁免燃煤進口稅二個月。</p>
<p>紗布南運限額　存廢各有見地</p>
<p>（四）紗布南運限額問題，本市棉紡及染織各界頗主廢除，惟在京時渠曾獲李代總統轉到廣東方面來電，又稱粵方紗布過賸，需求出口，相形之下，存廢各有見地。當時曾將此事託張茲闔等研究，認爲當時規定限額，與防止港地走私有關。惟關於此事，仍望多多徵求業中各領袖之高見，本人做事不望趨向衝動，祗要大家有一致之意見，而我又能辦得到，必盡力辦到。（南北通商，本人素所主張，蓋上海爲一製造地，原料需取給外方。惟本人主張南北易貨應採綜合易貨方式，不應指定某物必定易取某物。（六）商標局現正積極改進中，擬請吳承洛任局長，以後對翻查商標一事，特別研究改良之方。</p>
<p>謀大衆之利益　爲事業而服務</p>
<p>（七）窒礙難行之法令，請各位多多提供意見，查實後決定廢棄。例如：前政院通過之資委會鎢銻收購辦法，現已經政院通過取消，一俟立院通過，卽可明令廢棄。（八）關於進出口業所提外匯轉移與美金市價相去太遠一節，因此事偏於金融關係，而今日之事，除經濟財政之外，往往尚帶有軍事之成份在內，致使經濟部長全淪於人徵言輕之地位，惟本人仍本力之所逮，盡力設法解決困難。（九）鋼鐵業所需之原料，生鐵須待華北易貨，煤焦則萍鄉生產有餘，待設法請浙贛鐵路增加運輸量後，或可解決一部份之問題。（十）此外一切問題，仍望各界多多指教，本人絕無任何成見，決以大衆之利益爲利益，爲事業而服務。</p>

<p>中國方面報告</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿日電〕據鎭江中國海軍第二艦隊司令部發言人稱：紫水晶號係於今晨八時在口岸與三江營間遭遇共方砲火轟炸，南岸國軍第五十一軍士，曾遙見該艦被射擊，該艦縣有英旗，中彈後卽停駛並懸起白旗，五十一軍猶以爲該艦係中國軍艦，立卽電鎭江總部請示應採何種行動，惟中國海軍第二艦隊司令部以事先不知紫水晶號上駛，故告五十一軍以附近並無中國軍艦，因此五十一軍未曾自南岸發砲掩護，移時紫水晶號又啓椗向南京方面上駛，但北岸共軍立卽又開砲，該艦可能已經沉沒。</p>
<p>此間英海軍人士對於五十一軍所稱見紫水晶號懸起白旗之說，表示懷疑，彼等相信該艦係懸起另一白色標誌，以證明其英艦身份。在夥伴號發現紫水晶號所在以前，往來京港間担任傳遞外交文件之英空軍機一架，以及中國空軍偵察機均出動搜索，中國海軍砲艦一艘亦曾出動，惟均未曾發見。又夥伴號雖發見紫水晶號已經擱淺，但尚未查明該艦係中彈擱淺，抑爲避免砲火彎曲行駛而擱淺。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　黃行天</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十七日電〕汽車沿着錢塘江深入到原野中去，公路兩旁的阡陌中是茂盛的植物，桑樹正在茁長嫩綠的新葉，綠蘇的枯桿還有些留在田隴裏，豌荳花像花蝴蝶繁開在公路的斜坡上，粉黃的菜花，踱春風播送着清香，竹林呷隱約可以看到散落的村莊，男人戴着草笠，女人披着青花的頭巾，都在明媚的陽光下辛勤地工作着，這正是美麗而素樸的江南底原野。錢塘江是那麼嫺靜，江水默默地流着，駝着點點的風帆不息地前進；並且不時跳起浪花，撲打塘岸，發出清脆的聲響，歌唱着農村的美景。啊，這是多麼美好的自然底圖景。可是當浩浩的江水不服於河床的阻梗的時候，浪花便會激成怒濤，排山倒海地向兩岸衝擊過來，以無比的巨力，吞噬着兩岸的土地，房屋和生命。那時候，原野便膽怯而戰慄了，恐怖籠罩着大地。前年南沙坍江二十萬畝，潮水侵入陸地十餘里，頭蓬鎭屋被捲走五百餘棟，居民面江痛哭；去年秋潮，海寗寗西。袁收二鄉及翁家埠一帶冲光了數十里盥田，捲去了四十五個人和他們底家屋生財，被災盥民達二百三十餘戶。這種慘痛的歷史，形成一個巨大的陰影，籠照在江浙兩省杭·嘉·湖·松·蘇·常·太七郡的千百萬居民身上，影響着他們底安全。</p>
<p>錢塘江的大潮</p>
<p>雖然吸引着全國甚至全世界人士的好奇心，但它對於兩岸的千萬人民，總是一個極大的威者。遠自唐宋以來，潮災廥出無已，遜清乾隆時，傾國庫全力，興築海塘，北岸自杭縣上泗鄉至平湖金絲娘橋，長一九〇公里，南岸從蕭山臨浦鎭到上眞蒿壩鎭，長一一八公里，不僅在歷史上被譽為我國四大工程之一，而實際上也確保了兩浙人民一百餘年來的安全。可是抗戰八年，海塘失修，又是百孔千瘡。浙江省政府雖於民國卅五年成立海塘工程局，至今年三月底，塘工局結束，併入水利局，二年又七個月來，該局孜孜致力於海塘的添補和葺修，得以艱渡歷次兇潮，兩岸生靈，幸免於難。但在標本兼治的原則下，由護岸而至通航，塘工局確給浙江人民帶來更多的福音。但基於「先天的」塘壞得太多，和「後天的」經費來源困難，以致塘工不能如理想的展開，甚至某些地方士紳懷疑塘工局的挑水壩工程白費人力財力，毫無用處；有些主管長官也祗承認海寗以上的挑水壩工程是成功的，而海寗以下，似不宜於建挑水壩治江。爲了這，周碞主席會特地邀請工程專家和有關長官商討如火熱整治錢塘江的問題。爭論的焦點便在挑水壩。就工程說，挑水壩確是現代各國治江的一種有效工程，但由於經費的困難而零星的建築，加以錢塘江流的變幻和江潮的激湍，難免未能奏效。因此目前還祗能從治標着手，修築最緊要的海棠和補缺口，即陳汶港斜坡塘工程和四堡挑水壩護岸工程。當前年</p>
<p>海寗受災時候</p>
<p>塘工局是用柴塘來彌補陳汶港的缺口，暫時阻擋大潮，二年以來，由於經費問題，還祗作了五百公尺永久性的混凝土海塘，尚餘一千六百零四公尺的缺口。四堡的挑水壩優五個，塘工局已打好基礎，但是大潮仍是直接衝撞着塘身（滬杭公路就是建造在海塘上面）。因此形勢很危殆，須要趕築深入江流二百公尺的挑水壩，共需拋入塊石七萬多石方，（合十萬餘噸），現在還祗拋了一萬餘石方。前塘工局副局長汪胡楨會對記者說過：「我們做工程師的好像是醫師，能夠診病，能夠開方，但是沒有藥怎麼成呢」！錢塘江是浙江—也可說是東南地區的一條爛肚腸，需要好好用藥診治，現在總算由經合署美援專款來主辦這一個治標的建設，由「錢江海塘工程美援專款監理委員會工程處」主持陳汶港和四堡的二件工程。「藥」的問題解決了，工程便比較容易開展。美援工程處爲了趕上時間，在今年秋潮以前完成海塘工程，已決定限期在七月一日以前完成四堡五個挑水壩工程，和在七月底完成陳汶港永久性的混凝土斜坡塘工程。爲了供應工程的需要，湯山和尖山的兒歌採石場加工開採塊石；尖山的碎石供給陳汶港，湯山的大塊石供給四堡。記者對富陽湯山的機器採石工程已有過詳細報導；尖山的採石工程，其規模現在已超過湯山而上。不僅在器材上較湯山為多，有鑚孔的空氣壓縮機，有發電機，有推土機，有掘土機，……還有六座軋石機，而且尖山陳汶港間十二公里的距離上還築有輕便鐵道，有五列小火車，每列有二十輛鐵牛車，可以運十五公方合二十噸石頭。從炸開石山，變成小碎石到裝上火車，全部運用機械。每天可以出產四百公方的塊石，其中五百公方軋成碎石。爲了爭取時間，尖山採石場已於四月十六日起</p>
<p>加開夜丁採石</p>
<p>尖山位於海寗之間，突出在杭州灣中。從尖山沿杭州灣海岸到海寗丁橋鎭江邊的陳汶港，祗有半小時的汽車行程。車入這長凡一千六百公尺，寬二百五十公尺的大工場，神經便緊張起來，因為那麼多的機器和工人緊張地工作着，各盡所能地準備與秋汎兇潮作一次大搏鬥！包商國華公司的吳經理對記者說：「這一千六百多公尺的洋灰混凝土海塘，需用洋灰六萬六千袋，石子二萬立公方，售條石五萬根，塘身基礎用六寸厚洋松板椿五千一百根，圓水椿五千根，坦水用圓木椿六萬根，挖掘土方十六萬五千公方。單說打椿吧，到靈隱去拆這麼多的香也要費上幾天，我們得在五個月內完工，怎麼不要加緊工作呢」！</p>
<p>不僅工作緊張，而且這也是東南地區最鉅大的機械化工程。所有開溝，挖土推土，打椿，抽水，造塘，從始到底，都以機器進行，不過爲了適應工程進展的需要，也由工人配合機械工作。在這三千餘畝地的廣大工塲中，有五十餘工程師，二百多技術工人，四千餘男女工人，配合着七部推土機，三部掘溝機，五部挖土機，五部打　機，八部拌水泥機，五部起重機，十四部抽水機，百餘輛輕軌平車，十餘輛運輸輪卡車……·這四五千匹馬力的機械配合着四五千人的勞力，形成一種</p>
<p>偉大集體勞動</p>
<p>在燦爛的陽光下，在江水的伴奏中，起重機一起一下，推土機軋軋作聲，卡車和輕便平車穿來穿去，四五千工人們鋤着泥，挑着担，揮汗喘氣，「哼呵，嗨呵」的聲音好像遠處奔騰而來怒潮聲，成羣結隊的工人在土坑和土堆上，上上下下，人頭攢動，好像錢江大潮中浪頭的起落。在如雷的馬達聲中，在飛揚的灰沙中間，每一位工程師，每一個工人，每一部機器，各盡所能，執行其任務，配合成一種偉大的運動，在這運動中，頃刻之間平地變成高地，泥丘變為深溝，鉅大的木椿已深入地中。這是多麼偉大的力量啊！看着這樣的塲景，不禁想起古代造長城的故事了，那情景，想來也是如此。</p>
<p>是的，這個偉大的力量，正在建造防水的長城，為杭·嘉·湖·松·蘇·常·太七郡二千餘萬人民建造防水的長城。爲了適應這個偉大的工程，工塲裏已經造了活動木屋十一間，工房，機房，料庫等棚屋二百間；施工用汽車路五公里；輕便鐵道五公里；大小發電機五座，發電量二三〇瓩，敷設電力綫五公里；電燈一千餘盞；聞水站九處，有二百匹馬力，　水量五千餘萬加侖；無綫電十門交換機一具，可在工塲各地及陳汶港丁橋鎭材料轉運站通話；又設有可卸運五萬噸材料的水運碼頭一個。　　　三千餘畝的工塲，眞如一個錢塘邊</p>
<p>新興的工程城。在砲火連天的環境下，驕傲地工作着。當記者參觀的時候，挖土工程，已完成四萬公方，打基椿及板椿的設備也已佈置就緒，十七日起可開始機器打椿。如果沒有特殊的事故，全部工程便可如期萬成了。</p>
<p>前塘工局局長茅以昇氏會說過：「整治錢江，是浙江人民最偉大的責任。」可是浙江人民在運年的戰爭中已變得這麼窮。目前治標的修補工程，（陳汶港和四堡，二處工程約需美金一百餘萬元）也得賴外援的力量；治本的整治錢江，顯然是不能談起了。不過當茅以昇，汪胡楨二氏主持塘工局的時代，雖然經濟情況如舊，但是在工作上，從修塘護岸進而試辦錢江通航，什麽都很有生氣的。現在主管當局似乎已缺少這一種生氣，這是為貧窮的浙江人民深以為憂的。治標工程頂大的二件工程既已經由美援專款興辦了，水利局（塘工局）祗負設計的責任，則今後自應出其餘力致力於更偉大的目標。我們期待着浙江的繁榮，因此也不得不請主管當局切莫忘記茅以昇的話：「整治錢江是浙江人民最偉大的責任。」做公僕的能領導人民完成這個偉大的任務，他才可說是偉大的。</p>

<p>行伍出身從二等兵幹起，其間經過四次學校訓練，為國民黨員。去年奉交警總局之命到湖成立兩個交警總隊。恰巧湖省府其時正下令，一切國軍部隊在湘停止招募。張之招募工作，因此亦受阻挫，後來經過直接間接多番向程潛解釋，承認部隊在湘成立，將來就在湘担任保家衛鄉之責，並直接受綏署指揮。這樣程潛才答應了。其後在各縣招足了八千多人，同時交警總局也批准配撥卡平九百六十枝，湯姆生六百二十枝，重機槍二十挺，輕機槍三十挺，步槍一百枝，左輪三十四枝。正準備去領取的時候，恰巧當時的總局長偉龍被扣押，沒有領得成；同時又奉總局命，開赴浙江駐防。張是總局所委，部隊番號也是交警，當然應服從總局命令，乃向長沙兵站總監部洽領「御補證」，以備於行軍時隨處可以領糧，但兵站總監劉柔遠以未奉綏署命，拒不發給。這時，程潛亦適去京，無法交涉，如此輾轉，始終沒有遵命開拔。後來張派軍需李允中等四人，到總局駐衡辦事處領糧，大概總局辦事處對張的遲遲不遵命開拔，有所懷疑而不滿，當時不僅未發軍糧，反將李軍需扣押。如是，張弄得進退維谷，左右失據，全隊</p>
<p>官兵斷糧一月。張在此種情境下，乃召集全隊官兵計議，如何解決目前困難。會議席上，大家均無主張，最後還是人事室主任徐玉龍出主意，他說：「今天的事，不開拔就違抗了總局命令，開拔，却對不起程領公。但我們的部隊是領公准許成立的，我們的官兵是湖南子弟，還是不開拔的好」。經徐這樣一說，於是決議不開拔。等到程潛由京返長，張即將不開拔的決議和目的的困難情形，當面和盤報告。程潛當於三月十七日下了一道手令：「張先正交警第一總隊，准改編為湖南保安第五旅，即任命該總隊長為旅長，迅速編成三團，並發給養為要！此致劉參謀長（嘉樹）轉知保安司令部查照辦理」。程氏並當面囑咐張，可去醴陵领取那方面仓库裏交警总局所存的槍械。張奉諭當於三月十八日向兵站部領到穀子兩千石，金圓券一百萬元，十九日清晨即上車準備去醴陵。但上車後，想到這件事，程主席並無正式手令，怎敢貿然去收？於是馬上又下車，趕到省府，其時程主席尚未起床，只好分別寫了。</p>
<p>兩張條子，一留呈程主席，一留交秘書長鄧介松。大意是：往醴去槍事，命令未下，不敢行動，如必要時，（恐該部槍先被運走）先行取用，以充軍實，譴先報告備案。</p>
<p>上午九時，再回長沙車站乘車，抵株洲，聽說總局已將該倉庫槍枝運上火車，準備運浙。張當時一面派少校團附羅建將兩千石穀和一百萬金圓券運到衡陽茶市（張部駐地），本人即帶勤務兵十餘人，當晚趕到醴陵。翌日清晨調查，該項槍枝果已上車，乃命令車站將車廂當日開株，抵株後（二十一日）用電話報告長沙綏署劉參謀長，劉問現在槍在何處？張答已運到株。劉當指示即運長沙。並稱已派譚處長（綏署二處處長）前來接運。又說這件事由綏署負責，你不能負責。張於是在株候譚，直等到下午九時到株的不是譚處長，而是總局衡陽辦事處長曹鐵身。張獲得勤務兵的報告，曹帶了很多人。恐曹於己不利。乃帶了一個勤務兵去距車站四里遙之復興銀行，向廿九軍劉副軍長報告，詎劉不在。甫轉身出門，街上即廍戒嚴，不准通過。張此時亦墮入人民家，二十二日即以銀幣二元之代價，雇划到湘潭。湘潭駐有張之第二中隊。張到中隊部，一面囑中隊長張凱代為登報</p>
<p>聲明態度，同時找到廿三師長黃子華商量。張是時本擬直接到長沙見主席，但黃師長說，現在外間都已傳你叛變；同時對方對你此次舉動不滿，你恐怕不到長沙，就會被人捉去。不如先詑人疏通疏通。</p>
<p>張在湘潭住了好幾天，想不出好辦法，恰巧湘潭報紙載綏署第一處長會堅赴洞口與李精一商談李的出路問題，因會與張為同學，決計去洞口找會，傾訴此事件之經過，卅日搭車到邵陽，卅一日到竹篙塘，因李精一在山門，又雇轎去山門，途中為二十九軍盤查捕解到長。</p>
<p>現在張押在保安司令部。其自供情形頗近似。十一日那天，國防部來電綏署，會要求加以嚴懲。</p>

<p>申報社會服務攔編者先生：我們是居住在七浦路熱河路一帶的一羣小市民。最近有人要在那兩條馬路的專角處建造一所「公厠」，據說已經得到警察當局的許可（？），並已圍住籬笆（竟把豎立在那裡的路牌也圍在裏面！）好像就要動工興築似的。我們無從測知這「公厠」的用意何在。說是爲了便利公衆吧，但是附近海寗路底已有一所公厠，實在沒有再造的必要。就是要造，也不該造在那交通要道人烟稠密的地點。因為那裏的馬路本已狹隘，如果再加築房屋，必然妨碍交通無疑，而且菜市就在近旁，如果再那裏建造「公厠」，將來蠅蛆繁殖，散播疫癘，後患不堪設想。想來那人必為營利目的而為此，竟置公衆衛生公共交通於不顧，想賢明的衛生和警察當局必不允許他這樣胆大妄为吧。素仰　歸報熱心公益，敢請借　貴欄一角予以被露，俾引起衛生及警察當局的注意，而加以取締，那麼造福小民，功德無量了。敬祝撰安　一羣小市民謹上　四月十六日</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市場，場內仍現停頓，照例以一〇四五萬漲停板不動。場外現貨交易，上午央行雞無拋售，但因銀根緊市未退，人心委疲，開盤一三七〇萬，一四二〇萬，微高至一四一〇萬，一四四〇萬，中途因各方出籠頻繁，供多求少，一路低達一二六〇萬，一二九〇萬，午收為一三三〇萬，一三六〇萬。午後因頭寸轉松，港金報漲，人心向榮，隔日交易，開盤一七八〇萬，一八三〇萬，浮空紛紛抵補，一路直上至一八六〇萬，一八九〇萬。央行委託大德成兆豐昌壓低至一八〇〇萬，猛出三二〇大條，軋進頭寸五百七十六億，漲勢轉平。曾小至一七七〇萬，一八八〇萬，收盤為一七九〇萬，一八二〇萬。除息三百元，較上日反跌五〇萬。場外期貨交易，晨開一五三〇萬，一五八〇萬，高至一六〇〇萬，一六三〇萬，低至一五一〇萬，一五四〇萬，午收一五二〇萬，一五五〇萬，午後風平浪靜，當日交易，開盤一五七〇萬，一六〇〇萬，高至一六〇〇萬，一六三〇萬，中途因受央行拋金關係，一路小至一五〇〇萬，一五二零萬收盤，較上日軋漲二〇〇萬。隔日多空暗息，開高五十元，為三一〇元，三三〇元，差金以二十萬結價。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀樓飾金一波三折，上午一路掛低至一三五〇萬，一四〇〇萬，中午升值一三〇〇萬，一四五〇萬，下午又高至一四〇〇萬，一六〇〇萬，較上日再長五〇萬。飾銀平定，仍為十四萬，十七萬。錢兌業給赤當日現鈔掛牌，上午為一二五〇萬，一三五〇萬，下午升至一三五〇萬，一四五〇萬，亦加二五〇萬。</p>

<p>— 看台客</p>
<p>廠盤領導一般市價　發薪制度應有改良</p>
<p>大局嚇勢勢，已經很露骨的反映到市場上。</p>
<p>昨天上下半天，像兩個世界。下半天　的力量，超過了衝的力量。</p>
<p>黃金一碼當前，銀元僅漲了利息，花旗仍相形見絀，最凶險的，該是五洋市場了捲烟，肥皂火柴，市價本來比廠盤落後，流動煙柜，個個在鼻煙場老板抬價。昨天，市價跟上廠盤了。假使市價是兔子的話，廠盤必像與兔子競走中的烏龜一般，會繼續再接再厲的。</p>
<p>市價反映著銷路</p>
<p>廠盤反映著老板的心。</p>
<p>發一次工資，老板非賺足一次輸贏不可的。</p>
<p>若是不信，請翻看每月三日及十七日的各報廠盤欄，和當日市價欄對照一番，就赫然立見了。</p>
<p>廠盤價，竟會大過市價，只有中國社會　才有的。</p>
<p>工資薪水，改發銀元，車驚當局都贊同了。</p>
<p>指數每週公佈一次，是須要的。</p>
<p>如果工資薪水，也每週發一次；和過去半個月發一次，實在使職工階級更吃虧。</p>
<p>因為發薪次數越多，就是化整為零的程度越大。拿到的工資，買一擔煤球都不够了，這種工資不是更增加職工的痛苦嗎？然而，每週發薪資，就會造成這種局面的。</p>
<p>但是，像現在的局勢，半個月發薪資的辦法，實在是行不通了。因為是職工吃虧太大。過去幾期薪資節中的現象，就是鐵證要公公平平解決發薪辦法，實在只有兩個辦法：</p>
<p>（一）照戰前標準，一律改發銀元。</p>
<p>（二）照每期指數，預發一個月薪資，到期分別補足。</p>
<p>照戰前標準，一律改發銀元，是天公地道的。先決條件，央行必須負充分供應銀元的責任，這是絕對不可能的。</p>
<p>預發一個月，是比較合理的。因為過去照指數發薪，是用過去的平均物價指數的工資，而發薪日的物價，是過去的最高物價，職工已經吃了大虧。何況用工資的時候，物價又在上漲，所以拿工資時的指數，對用工資時的物價比較時，又是最低的指數，職工更吃虧了。</p>
<p>總而言之，過去的指數發薪資方法本身，已使每個職工很明顯的受著二重損失的。</p>
<p>財長劉攻云氏，有掛冠求去意，其實，大可不必的。</p>
<p>「時勢造英雄」，此時經濟局勢如此混亂，馮劉氏對於市場技巧之熟練，很可為國多多出力的。過去，劉氏失策，遭各方指摘，平心而論，因為劉氏施策沒有一定原則之故，前財長徐堪氏，本領也很大，實在也煩著同樣錯誤。</p>
<p>譬如舉個例子：在發薪前央行常常拋壓金價市價－其實此時廠商們，正想抬高貨價，套出存貨調頭寸的時候，因此，凡屬老板，哪個不把央行恨盡恨絕。</p>
<p>控制市場，既不知運用社會政策，去維護勞工市民的利益，又不知運用資本主義原理，去維護資產階級的利益，那末，不獲輿情，都是他自取其咎的。</p>
<p>假使劉氏能把喔這相對的原則，憑他控制市場的經驗，並非不可作為的。</p>
<p>劉氏其三思之！</p>
<p>劉財長施策少原則　憑能力本大可作為</p>

<p>食米昨市略見挺升，因銀根緊俏，暗息高昂，出戶多而進戶少，各貨雖均較昨升十餘萬元，但尚不到利息所耗，故為明升暗疲而已。北市白粳一四七萬元，計漲十七萬，早薄稻各漲十五萬之譜，南市白粳一百四十五萬，薄稻一百五十萬，後市照此價賣不出，今日期款，白粳一六〇萬，早稻一五六萬，二市到貨共計四九七四石。</p>
<p>食油　市勢盤旋趨降，因銀根緊，散戶均觀望不納，貨主售股，去路甚呆，生菜油最高七百十萬，收市六百七十萬，豆油收市七百八十萬元，計降二三十萬元，吉桶生油七百二十萬，下跌四十萬元，豆餅初疲后堅。</p>
<p>麵粉　市勢盤旋，從開市迄收市，價格均在堅檔徘徊，老車晨開五十四萬，最高五十五萬六千，收市回做伍拾伍萬元，兵船客銷極揚，一度回站五十三萬，收拾銀根猛緊，重建下游，以五十二萬做開。麩皮前日不及追趕粉市漲風，昨再砌高一成，大包初開四十六萬元，臨收齊登四十七萬五千元高峰。</p>
<p>雜糧　在寸頭緊俏下，市勢多見疲落，惟黃豆生仁客幫有吸，市價均見上揚，冬豆百四十萬，最高百六十萬元，生仁挺一成，苞米先平後疲，紅雜平定，芝麻交易轉旺。</p>

<p>昨日紗市明堅暗疲，緣以市拆高昂，執戶鑒於拆借困難，售意甚濃，客幫僅華南方面略有吸進，同業搜購尚暢，結果各紗雖漲起一成，但仍不能維持拆息。</p>

<p>〔辦報訊〕本市體育記者聯誼會主辦之大公對麥令斯中西兩強籃球表演賽，昨晚七時一刻在市體育館舉行，大公隊遠征海外，業與滬上球迷小別數月，麥另斯在聯賽中愈打愈硬，近況　佳，觀眾昨晚慕名前往者凡三千餘人，結果大公以四十五比卅五勝，上半時兩軍堅守陣地，大公以二十比十四領前六分。</p>
<p>賽前尚有男女友誼賽兩場，女將雅隊勝力隊，卅二比廿四。男子大同勝約翰，廿九比廿四。女組表演輕鬆，兩隊大學雄師始終在力拼狀態中。</p>
<p>昨晚大公隊演出殊佳，蔡文華頭腦清楚，黃柏齡建功最多，蔡忠強有飛將軍的狀態，展琛衝似脫兔，屠文龍勇冠三軍，葉雲山亦頗出力。惟昨晚該隊有時似呈「氣」不足的情形，據謂蔡連科已決定退出大公，莫怪此公不見也。麥另斯動作極快，華而許，萊姆山，凱雄等表演殊為出人頭地。</p>
<p>大山五人為蔡忠強，蔡文華，展琛，屠文龍，葉雲山。七時廿五分開火，葉屠先後犯規，萊姆山凱雄各一分，雲山中，各二平手。文華輕快，罰中時大公透一口氣。忠強心思縝密，展琛靜以待變，老屠的剽悍，雲山的肯跑，還是未見顏色，可知麥另表演的「好」與「緊」。洋小孩萊姆山二罰，展蔡力擲二球，成七比五，黃柏齡易出忠強，對方大力士華而許三分拉成七平。文華推中，凱雄再造均勢。雲山中藍，麥令連調三將，反不如前，大公穩紮穩打，發球「積少成多」。十五比十時，文龍已四次犯規，忠強再上，文華調度得法，百齡罰中上半時鐘蠁，二十比十四，麥令落後六分。</p>
<p>休息再賽，展琛得文華濟助，輕易入籃，忠強的乾脆迅速，與百齡相繼建功。麥令華而許凱雄萊姆山三劍客，始終不服氣，無奈大公展琛百齡均有收穫，保持優勢，卅三比廿七屠代文華，麥令大力士五次犯規離場，實力愈差，卅六比廿七，忠強亦五次而下野，由張根生填缺。麥令內防空虛，有潰不成軍現象，根生傳球恰到好好處，百齡　得來全不費工夫，詹又五次被黜，由王存忠替之，王失手被罰出，文華重披征衣。最後一分鐘屠葉均犯規五次，大公無人可調，三個打五個，麥令亦有五次畢業者，結果四十五比卅五，大公勝麥令十分。</p>

<p>女子友誼賽雅隊力隊，首先於四座當聲中上塲，鳴笛接觸，雅隊汪澤綸一球「開風氣之先」，汪小姐的穩射，頃刻五比一，力隊梁妙玲施展妙技，漸入佳境，七比五祇差一球。忽見孫鳳竹錢夢月兩人兩路夾攻，第一節雅隊十一比五領前。第二節黃如玉代澤綸，對方王嘉萃替嘉華，雙方形勢平均，上半時雅隊十七，力隊十分。</p>
<p>第三節雅隊出手甚快，獲分較多，力隊運球突破敵方防綫，表演亦精彩，是節爲廿五比十五。末節夢月翻身一球，有意想不到之妙，力隊愈戰愈勇，嘉萃妙珍霞雲三將搭擋純熟，連擲帶罰，頗有反勝情態，雅隊不敢怠慢，終以卅二比廿四勝。</p>

<p>男子友誼賽約翰對大同，兩校大學雄師，「各有巧妙不同」，集海上各強隊之精華，這一場球也可稱「非同小可」，應當刮目相看。開囊后大同李漢庭先中，約翰孫摩西報復，比分在二四六的一平再平，李漢庭罰中七比六，徐仲已一球九比七，樂嘉州人小球老，十五比十一。約翰胡惠昭代莊逸榮，不久王恭森易陶瑩石出，摩一四拉成十六平手，國政罰中，上半時得以十七比十六估先一分。</p>
<p>下半時上場，約翰球神不靈，籃下球每多失之交臂，觀眾惋惜。主將孫國政亦露疲態，罰球二次未中，廿三比廿漸見落後，嘉州五次犯規，一副尷尬面孔。最後三分鐘，約翰國政摩西發揮威力，兩度「退扳」一雙，緊張萬分，大同結果以廿九比廿四勝約翰。</p>

<p>— 王心景著　陳霖笙校</p>
<p>所以我們還擊同樣的來球，可以得到各種不同的結果，因為球和拍的角度兩種，拍出的球也有高低的分別。</p>
<p>球的來往是成抛物線的，我們把同樣角度的球拍去拍球，因為球著拍有遠近的關係，拍出的球也會分出高低來。</p>
<p>上面是說明球的高低，是由於著拍時的球和拍的角度上分出來；假使我們要把球做主體，也可以知道球有高低的緣故，是從—球的受力點—上分出來的。我們如用球拍擊來球的最近點，那麼球體所受的力量，各部均勻，前進的方向和力的方向幾相符而平直；擊球的下部，那麼球底部所受的力較大，而勢必趨上。</p>
<p>總括的說一句，節制高地，應察來球的趨勢，自己站立的地位，看當時的便利。而異其節制的方法。</p>
<p>關於方向的節制</p>
<p>排出的球的正確，應注意高低的節制外，還得對於拍出的方向有把握。這種方向的節制，是在一，手臂擺動的方向；二，球拍的偏正；三，力的著點上分出來的。</p>
<p>手臂擺動的方向</p>
<p>有手臂的擺動，才會發生「力」，手臂擺動的方向，就是「力」之所至。球也隨「力」的直線方向而去。手臂擺動向前直進的，球的方向也是正的；擺動向側面的，可以把球擊成斜線。所以球的方向就是手臂擺動的方向。</p>
<p>球拍的偏正</p>
<p>球拍的向前或是扁平，可以節制球的高低；球拍的偏正，可以節制球的方向。球拍向左偏著拍出的球，球的方向也向左。有時手臂的擺動向右，但到近球時；把球拍向左略偏，球的方向也一定會發生變化。</p>
<p>力的著點</p>
<p>球面受力之點，有上下的分別，擊出的球就有高有低。即使球的受力點偏左或是偏右，就影響到球的方向。拍詩擊球的左部的，右半球就受力小，而傾向右方。排球的右面的，結果是傾向左面。但用此種方法節制方向，因為球體各部受力不均，發生自轉，所以方向偏正的程度也很少把握。</p>
<p>這種方向地節制，總括說起來，不外直線和斜線兩種。</p>
<p>斜線練習法</p>
<p>對方拍來的球是成斜線的，那麼拍來球的正面，球就會還到原地方去。來球是直線的，也祗要認定目標，把球拍向左或是向右稍稍側一點，拍出的球也是成斜線了。</p>
<p>這種基本的動作，練習得愈多愈好，同時應注意對方派來的球的落點，球性的強弱，彈力的高低；……自己還擊用怎樣的角度？球拍應偏到如何程度？球拍的角度過小，往往容易死於網內；角度過大，拍時用力太大的，就容易出檯，角度大，用力小的，球勢軟弱而高，給對方極好的壓殺機會。至於球拍偏的太厲害了，會把球拍到旁邊去的。</p>
<p>有些人往往只看到對方手臂的動作，而謀還擊的方法。通常用這種方法，本來也不好算錯，不過遇著對方經驗多，拍法熟的，很容易受欺騙。像對方的手臂時向前直進的，依猜想它的來路也應該直進。但對方在拍著球的一霎那，把球拍稍稍側一點，可以變換球的方向，這時自己預備還擊的姿勢就完全無效，而至無法應付當前的來球。</p>
<p>直線練習法</p>
<p>球的一來一往是很快的，我們應當有當機立斷的能力。因為球的來去，稍縱即逝，一經猶豫，就成錯誤了</p>
<p>直線的練習，是從自己的右方打到對面的左方，或是從坐方打到對面的右方，球的方向是成直線進行的。要是對方的來球是斜線的，那麼還出去的球要成直線，比較的是很吃力的，尤其是不執球拍的手的一邊。但制勝克敵，利用對方的疏於防備，也容易收效。</p>
<p>還擊對方斜線進行的球，球拍一定要稍稍側一點。至於要測到怎樣的程度，是很難說的。第一要知道來球的斜度和落點；第二要曉得球勢的強弱，球進行的可能程度。然後才好謀應付的方法。</p>
<p>這種斜線的和直線的方法，在初學的時候，應該十分注意，因為在將來各種拍法上是很有好處的。</p>

<p>九州與華光之民主盃足球賽，昨在南市舉行劇戰九十分鐘，以一比一媾和，勝負不分，可謂棋逢敵手。華開球先攻，聲勢頗勝，約十分鐘即由陳宇偉打進一球，惜以陳良璉越位作廢，華光再接再厲，三十分鐘陳良璉傳球右方，尚世琪順勢奔上，拉起一腳，球由門之左角穿入，漂亮之極。九州毫不氣餒，立刻發動攻勢，，未三分鐘，強遠智窮前拉射，球觸陳克明與徐國平兩人之腿桿彈入門內，頓成各一平手。下半時起競爭益烈，雙方表演俱極精彩，華光鋒線行動迅速，九洲羅壽福與金祿生之遞合作，尤見珠聯璧合，觀眾喝彩之聲不絕於耳。但兩隊防禦線在孟義良與吳祺坐鎮之下，分庭抗禮，備形堅固，致前鋒均不能突破最後一關，結果仍以各一盡歡而散。</p>

<p>四屆兵乓聯賽，今晚七時起續有甲組一場，及乙組五場角逐，甲組由華美對壘綢白於綢業球市，華美為上屆亞軍，擁有全運會乒乓亞軍薛緒初及李宗沛睦漢俊等宿將，陣容堅強，聲勢雄壯，該隊原定於揭幕賽中出戰全綠，臨時因觀眾過分擁擠，不克成賽，足見其號召力之強大，今晚尚數初次露臉，以上三將球藝精湛，必勝無疑，此役起用新血薛偉初及削手王九慶，一試板上功夫。綢白正在失利于聯星之後，自難抵擋雄師之侵犯，如能佈陣得法，並以全力相抗，或可與一線機會中謀打破零分之紀錄。</p>
<p>乙組五場中，永五為乙一部之勁旅，紅白乃聖約翰之學生軍，身手亦舒不弱，雙方定有劇戰。</p>

<p>四屆市長盃男女籃球賽，今日續有三塲，在市體育館舉行，原定首仗女組約翰　鷹隊，五時半開始，惟鷹隊係滬江大學同學所組織，今日適逢考試，而市長盃又不准改期，遂商得其餘五隊同意，將秩序及時間酌加調動，門票照舊，樓上五千，樓下一萬，對號二萬，調動秩序時間如下：</p>
<p>回力—懋勛（男組）六時</p>
<p>約翰—鷹隊（女組）七時</p>
<p>大公—莆隊（男組）八時</p>
<p>首仗回力與懋勛對壘，回力在本屆聯賽中與滬警並列季軍，該隊原具北派作風，惟自得吳成章指導及葉雲山陳正淼等助陣後，面目一新，而球藝亦蒸蒸日上，實力强勁自不待言。懋勛爲甲二A之第二名麾下孫家　劉昭仁卓觀政等饒勇善戰，自非阿蒙可比，惟今晚勁敵當前，勝利希望則鮮。</p>
<p>次幕女組約翰鷹隊兩路娘子軍角逐，雙方同屬校隊，實力伯仲，前者有李淼朱敏林靜怡張羅羅等好手，後者在王珊領導下球藝亦楚楚可觀，屆時乍逢，勝敗難卜。</p>
<p>最後一塲大公相逢莆隊，大公威力之强，海　球迷類能道之，自達征海外歸來後，昨始初度公開漏臉，擊敗洋兵麥令斯，球藝更見進境，蔡文華蔡連科屠文龍蔡忠强黃柏齡五將猛悍如虎，王存忠詹琛張根生演出亦有獨到。莆隊閩籍同鄉組成，亦有林啓仁黃文澄柯炳炎等好手，但今日戰來，大公當可順利晋級。</p>

<p>〔無錫訊〕上海首流強旅警機，及康隊籃球隊，因幕本邑湖光山色，特於昨連袂遠征萊錫，本月十五日下午三時半起，在公園球場，舉行友賽兩場，觀眾人山人海總數擋在三千人以上，盛況空前。</p>
<p>前場警機對本邑江南大學隊，開賽後，彼起此仆，競爭甚烈，下半時結束客軍以十一比十佔先，下半時警機長力充沛，攻勢轉盛，結果客軍以二五比十六力克江大隊。次場本邑盟主郵電出擊強旅康隊，終四時半正，「郵電」「康隊」相機入場，場內情緒頓成熱烈緊張，查康隊此次征錫，除原有陸大振，王長安，容承恩，童延煊，徐順富等好手外，並邀得晨友及春茂名將梁永標，高家驥，張天祥等助陣，不啻如虎添翼，實力倍增，但此役郵電隊雖有大將高保生，蔣國平，因公缺席，然以王春元，吳錦文，呂清寶，李方膺，戴堯章，唐民生，余堯，七員虎將輪流作戰，固陣容仍極堅強。開賽後，雙方短兵相接，至為緊張，演出極盡精彩，上半時終了，郵電以十六比十領前六分。易籃再戰，郵電不但防術森嚴，且攻勢銳利，客軍僅由梁永標作個人表演，無奈郵電合作默契，比賽結果，郵電以四十四比三十二擊敗康隊。</p>

<h3 id="c127">漫談來遲一步 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 范瘦梧</p>
<p>官吏的幹預，造成了政治上的無能；政治上無能的終極，是使本身解體，歷史改觀。這是中外一轍，古今同慨的恨事。</p>
<p>讀十一日本報，載有以「來遲一步」為標題的新聞一則，內容大意謂；「……限價期間，在美定印之大批五元紗，已經運到。可惜在運到的此刻，是項票面因不能供應市場的流通而失其效用，等於廢紙，當局將查明責任……」云云。這種怪事，真是世紀末的悲哀。</p>
<p>「來遲一步」的事實，雖是令人感歎，但在我國卻已屢見不鮮。譬如民國三十六年黃泛成災，雖民數十萬嗷嗷待哺，政府官吏固亦大聲呼賑，然而一方面在大唱其高調，一方面卻聽憑行總的救濟麵粉在倉庫裡發酵，以至於霉爛。待得「查明責任」（？），再籌的款，十餘萬炎黃裔胄，早已因賑濟的「來遲一步」，而赴召首陽山，去從伯夷叔齊游了。</p>
<p>「來遲一步」的事蹟，非慬近事有偶，歷史上更多前例。明末，洪承疇為薊遼總督，師出山海關，給滿洲的騎兵殺得大敗，退守松山（在錦州西南），又被滿兵團團圍住。洪承疇在城中看看士氣尚旺，別無足慮，最感威脅的，莫過於糧草空虛。不得以，乃招募死士，破壁突圍，向北京告急。崇禎帝當即詔令戶部，火速從海道運量駛援。戶部以海運需海船，乃草擬一紙咨文，把艦船的責任諉諸工部。工部接咨，以海船工匠船塢，多在山東登萊各島，就也如法炮製，行出一紙文書，給山東地方官廣他急辦。這一件「救兵如救火」事關國家存亡的耍公，這樣你退我拖下去，直到洪承疇糧盡降清，李闖入京，崇禎自縊，清兵入關，福王南京稱帝，在這一段長時間的過程里，公文旅行的「牛步」，尚進僅乎轉到福建的巡撫衙門。內容為：「著即採購建造與運量海船木料」，云云。</p>
<p>據此則「來遲一步」的「先進」正多著呢！有人說：耽誤金圓五元券「應市」的那些財政官兒，雖有「虛耗國幣」之嫌，實有「收縮通貨」減少發行之功。即以行政效率論，比明末的官吏似亦尚勝一籌。那末，我們總算還可聊以自慰。</p>
<h3 id="c128">明星保險 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>我們常到好萊塢的電影公司宣傳說：瑪琳黛德麗的大腿，保險了多少萬美金；狄安娜寶萍的歌喉保了多少萬美金的險，等等。這些雖是宣傳手段，但亦有事實根據。因為好萊塢明星，在拍片時的確都保過險的。保過險的明星，在拍片時期內，因患病或意外受傷而使電影公司遭受損失時，承包的保險公司負有賠償的義務。</p>
<p>奇怪得很，承保這種險的保險公司，竟不是美國人自己，確實遠隔重洋開設在倫敦的英商「利奧德保險公司」。第一個想到替明星保險的人，是好萊塢的製片巨頭柴茲尼克。當時沒有一家美國保險公司願意做這筆生意，於是由利奧德公司承保了下來。後來，其他製片商紛起效尤，美國保險公司亦競相承保，不過，總以老資格的利奧德佔優勢。雖然它對每一家電影公司的賠償，以七十五萬美金為最高限額。</p>
<p>每一年有好幾百萬美金，從好萊塢流到利奧德的銀庫，也就是替英國政府賺取了不少外匯。在每一張片子拍攝之前，經由洛杉磯的保險掮客之手，將「明星保險」交付給利奧德。每一個列名保險單上的明星，與開拍之前三天內，都要到指定的醫生處去檢驗身體，使保險公司知道他們的健康狀況。</p>
<p>在倫敦利奧德公司的檔案中，對好萊塢每一位大明星的個人歷史，都有詳細統計。要知道那一個明星蛀牙或者血管腫脹，或者她的血壓是多少，是否過分飲酒或吸煙，只要一查這些檔案，便能知其究竟。</p>
<p>「明星保險」使製片商減少了不少損失。例如，柴茲尼克在攝製「自君別後」一片時，因主演明星是克勞黛考爾白，珍妮弗佩斯等的患病或意外事件而延緩拍片工作所受的損失，就由利奧德公司賠償了三十五萬四千美元。在以前，明星因故不能拍片時，一切損失都是有製片者獨自承擔的，如今卻有分擔的人了。</p>

<p>我於吃肉，如嗜酒者然，不論是肥是精，無不歡迎。一塊在口，便覺其味無窮。記得抗戰初起，正當血氣之年，我跑到內地，也以穿一套草綠色制服為榮。入伍訓練是在景德鎮。其地物價之便宜，出乎意料。豬肉每斤銅元二十八枚，雞三十枚。上奉每月發給六塊錢伙食費，還白吃軍米。六塊錢完全買菜，白鐵皮的三格菜匣，每天都是滿滿一匣豬肉。天氣又熱，大塊油光光的肥肉，尤其顯得肉麻；雖然火頭軍的烹調術不夠講究，我卻不厭粗劣，太交鴻運。一匣豬肉，起碼享受半匣。</p>
<p>二十八年在湖南，肉價也很便宜，豬肉每斤大洋一角，牛肉一元二十斤，爲了吃不消湖南人的辣椒飯，我是自理伙食，也更加稱了自己心意。蔬菜根本不上檯面，一例肉打官司。有時懶得動手，就上上館子。湘館吃肉，以粉蒸肉最夠味。這種粉蒸肉，怕油膩的人也能吃；在我吃起來自然更加適合。大盆一碗夠飽，小盆就得兩碗。湖南茶房打起長沙官話問我酒飯，我總是搖頭，因為有粉有肉，其他自然不必了。這是我吃肉史上的全盛時代，堪稱「貞觀之治」。惜乎在二十九年以後，通貨不斷貶值，所獲薪水連吃飯都不夠飽，遑論吃肉。自此六七年間的歷史，便淪入一個黑暗時代，而且刦運愈來愈甚，竟有整個半年不當肉味。</p>
<p>直到去年金圓券問世，叨蔣經國限價之功，經濟總算穩定一時。拿了薪水着實經用。我的吃肉運道，又獲轉機。買上三斤五斤，燒燒一大鐵頭，好幾天享受不盡。那兩月功夫吃福不淺，堪稱「中興時代」。可惜好景不長，刦運又來；豆腐羅葡無覓處，，哪裡有肉？即有也是望肉興歎，徒呼負負而已。直到過年買了三斤肉，吃來已是滿口心酸，大非當年滋味。運來過屠門而大嚼，挈梅止渴而已。時而上飯舘喊兩塊鹹肉豆腐，已覺滿身大汗。撫今追昔，直如白頭宮女道天寶遺世。想不到吃肉小事，也是十餘年來世道的寫照也。</p>

<p>— 濤</p>
<p>四月十五日早晨八點半，看弄堂暨掃垃圾的老媽子，送來了一份多季房捐繳款書。</p>
<p>我丟下了報紙，一看數目，清清楚楚的寫著：三圓六角。當時，我真有一點不懂，道三圓六角是指金圓券，還是袁大頭，亦或是生活指數呢？</p>
<p>這時弄中已聚集了很多人，在討論著這三元六角的究竟。</p>
<p>張家嫂嫂道：「這三圓六角恐怕是大頭吧？否則，三圓六角金圓券，運的印刷費也不夠啊！還有紙張費，人力，政府盡不要大大地蝕本了？並且現在政府的門檻也相當精，一歇這樣捐，一歇那樣捐，而在這明正言實的房捐上，卻會做蝕本的大傻瓜？」</p>
<p>王太太道：「我想是三圓六角的指數吧？三圓六角的大頭，到底要四十多萬哩！」</p>
<p>「對呀！一定是指數，一定是指數，照大頭計算，到底是太辣手了」—大家說。</p>
<p>「那末，照指數算也應該就付呀！等一歇十一點鐘一發表，頂起碼要一萬幾千倍，跟上次三千四百零二倍，可差得遠呢」！李先生橫裹殺出。</p>
<p>「唔——」大家唔了一聲，張家嫂嫂看看王太太，王太太看看李先生。</p>
<p>王太太的眼光東一射，西一掃，掃射到我的面孔上，突然停止了。</p>
<p>「章先生，還是你先去走一遭吧！你年紀輕，腳步快，嘴巴活，假如真的照指數計算，那末你就回來，讓我們也可以早點兒去付脫。」</p>
<p>我與情面難卻下，只好衝頭陣，走一趟了。並且對門的小麻子，也自告奮勇，情願伴我走一次。</p>
<p>路上，我和小麻子好像在競走似的，一陣的亂跑。</p>
<p>一會兒，上海市銀行第七辦事處已到。</p>
<p>我把繳款書送上了，那位職員看了看：「三圓六角。」</p>
<p>「先生，是金圓？是大頭？是指數？」</p>
<p>「金圓。」</p>
<p>「是——」</p>
<p>「是金圓，聽見嗎？」</p>
<p>「噢！是三圓六角金圓！」我一邊說，一邊掏出了一張五元的鈔票，它，曾經遭到乞丐不要的鈔票，想不到今天卻派用場了。</p>
<p>他在繳款書上蓋好了印，收據鈔票一併送到我手裡，並且說：</p>
<p>「三圓六角有什麽用，不要了！」</p>
<p>小麻子做人倒爽氣，拿了收據，付鈔票的樣子也不做，就和我走了。</p>
<p>到了家裡，告訴了鄰居們，這三圓六角不是袁大頭，也不是生活指數，而是金圓券。鄰居們都異口同聲的說：</p>
<p>「真的嗎？政府真的肯做大傻瓜嗎？難得，難得！」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Government Refuses CCP Demands, Still Hoping for Ceasefire Before Peace Talks; Reply Delivered by Delegation in Peiping; Wu Tiecheng, Huang Shaohong Fly to Guangzhou, Zhang Qun to Xikou for Report <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The government has decided to reject the CCP's eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the proposed peace agreement. The reply telegram was transmitted from Nanjing to the government's peace talk delegation in Peiping on the afternoon of the 20th. It will be delivered to the CCP delegation by Zhang Zhizhong that evening. The success or failure of the current peace talks will depend on the CCP's reaction to this reply. The government's reply is a comprehensive response to the CCP's twenty-four clauses, rather than a point-by-point rebuttal. The main points of the telegram state: (1) The fundamental spirit of the CCP's clauses is unequal and unreasonable, not in the spirit of peace talks, and is unacceptable to the government. (2) It is hoped that the CCP will reconsider its attitude based on the interests of the people, cease fire first, and then continue peace talks. The full text is very long. The first paragraph describes the government's efforts to compromise, endure humiliation, and seek peace, and explains the deep suffering the people have experienced since the eight-year war of resistance, and their eagerness for the arrival of peace. President Chiang's retirement is also a manifestation of sincere peace seeking. It then states: The draft proposed by the CCP is an attitude towards the conquered, especially the designated signing on the 20th, which is tantamount to an ultimatum. The various clauses are like a verdict against the government, which the government cannot implement. The consequences are unimaginable and will inevitably lead to a greater war, and the nation will suffer a tragic fate. The so-called reorganization of the army is actually the elimination of the national army. If implemented, it will arouse the indignation of the military and civilians, and the country's wealth and people's property will suffer a catastrophe. The united government will have people appointed by the CCP, which is tantamount to the government surrendering and disarming. The government is willing to compromise, but the military and civilians across the country cannot accept it, so it is hoped that the CCP will reconsider and change its attitude. The telegram also pointed out that the widespread attacks by the communist army in Jiangbei in recent days are hindering the peace talks, and it is hoped that both sides can sign a ceasefire agreement first and then continue the peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The government spokesman issued the following statement late on the 20th regarding the government's response to the CCP: "The government has formally responded to the CCP's proposed clauses on the afternoon of the 20th, hoping that the CCP will consider the content of our response in a spirit of equality, and hope that a temporary ceasefire agreement can be established first, and then long-term discussions can be held." The spokesman said: The government's reply telegram was signed jointly by Acting President Li and President of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin, and was sent by telegram to Zhang Zhizhong on the afternoon of the 20th to be forwarded to the CCP.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Standing Committee Passes Statement <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 20th] Wu Tiecheng, Huang Shaohong, and others arrived in Guangzhou by plane from Nanjing at 7:20 p.m. on the 20th. That night at 9 p.m., the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee convened an interim meeting. Wu and others reported on the process of the peace talks, the CCP's plan, and the content of the government's reply. A statement on the CCP's "plan" was then passed, and the meeting adjourned at midnight. (The full text of the statement, more than a thousand words, will be published tomorrow.)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Peace Talk Guidance Committee met at 9 a.m. on the 20th to continue detailed discussions on the CCP's eight articles and twenty-four clauses. By 12 p.m., a resolution had been reached, which was immediately telegraphed to the government's peace talk delegation in Peiping to be forwarded to the CCP authorities. Wu Tiecheng and Huang Shaohong took a special Tzu Chiang plane to Guangzhou around 2 p.m. to report to the Central Standing Committee. When reporters asked for his opinion at the airport, Mr. Wu only said, "Seek our own unity to reverse the overall situation." Huang, on the other hand, has decided to resign from his position as a government peace talk representative and plans to fly to Hong Kong on the 21st for recuperation, and will not be involved in politics. Zhang Qun and Wu Zhongxin also flew to Xikou one hour (3 p.m.) after Wu and others left Nanjing to report to President Chiang, and will return to Nanjing on the 21st.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th] After the government peace talk delegation and the CCP delegation began peace talks in Peiping, the CCP delegation submitted a so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" to the government delegation. The full text is excerpted as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e4">Domestic Peace Agreement <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Nanjing National Government of the Republic of China, with the help of the US government, violated the will of the people, broke the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and launched a nationwide civil war against the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the banner of opposing the Chinese Communist Party. This war has lasted for two years and nine and a half months. The people of the whole country have suffered greatly, the country's financial and material resources have suffered great losses, and the country's sovereignty has also suffered great damage. The people of the whole country have long expressed dissatisfaction with the Nanjing National Government's violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three People's Principles, violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's correct policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, and violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary deathbed testament. The people of the whole country especially oppose the Nanjing National Government's launching of this unprecedented nationwide civil war, and the resulting political, military, financial, economic, cultural, and diplomatic errors and measures. The Nanjing National Government has completely lost trust among the people of the whole country, and in this civil war, the Nanjing National Government's army has been defeated by the People's Liberation Army, which is led by the Chinese Communist Party and commanded by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. Based on the above situation, the Nanjing National Government proposed to the Chinese Communist Party on January 1, 1949, to hold negotiations to stop the civil war and restore a state of peace. The Chinese Communist Party issued a statement on January 14 of the same year, agreeing to the above proposal of the Nanjing National Government, and proposed to punish war criminals, abolish the pseudo-constitution, abolish the pseudo-legal system, reorganize all reactionary troops according to democratic principles, confiscate bureaucratic capital, implement land reform, abolish traitorous treaties, convene a new political consultative conference without reactionary elements, establish a democratic coalition government, and take over all the powers of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government and its subordinate governments at all levels. These eight basic conditions have been agreed to by the Nanjing National Government. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party and the Nanjing Government sent their own delegations, authorized to hold negotiations and sign agreements. Representatives of both sides gathered in Peiping and first confirmed that the Nanjing National Government should bear full responsibility for this civil war and its various erroneous policies, and agreed to establish this agreement.</p>
<p>Article 1, Clause 1: In order to distinguish right from wrong and determine responsibility, the Chinese Communist Party delegation and the Nanjing National Government delegation (hereinafter referred to as both parties) confirm that the war criminals on the Nanjing National Government side who should be responsible for launching and executing this civil war must be punished in principle, but may be handled separately according to the following circumstances: Item 1, all war criminals, regardless of who they are, if they can recognize right from wrong, repent sincerely, have true and sincere expressions, and are conducive to the advancement of the Chinese people's liberation cause, and conducive to solving domestic problems by peaceful means, they will be allowed to cancel the name of war criminals and given lenient treatment. Item 2, all war criminals, regardless of who they are, who are stubborn and unrepentant, hinder the advancement of the people's liberation cause, are not conducive to solving domestic problems by peaceful means, or even incite rebellion, should be severely punished, and those who lead the team to rebel should be responsible for being suppressed by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. Clause 2, both parties confirm that the Nanjing National Government's announcement on January 26, 1949, that General Okamura Yasuji, a Japanese war criminal who invaded China, was innocent and released, and its permission on January 31 of the same year to deal with other Japanese items, etc., were wrong. These Japanese war criminals should be re-handled as soon as the Chinese Democratic Coalition Government, that is, the new central government representing all the Chinese people, is established.</p>
<p>Article 2, Clause 3: Both parties confirm that the "Constitution of the Republic of China" passed by the "National Assembly" convened by the Nanjing National Government in November 1946 should be abolished. Clause 4: After the "Constitution of the Republic of China" is abolished, the fundamental law that the Chinese state and people should follow should be implemented in accordance with the resolutions of the new Political Consultative Conference and the Democratic Coalition Government.</p>
<p>Article 3, Clause 5: Both parties confirm that all the legal systems of the Nanjing National Government should be abolished. Clause 6: In the areas where the People's Liberation Army has arrived and taken over, and after the establishment of the Democratic Coalition Government, the people's democratic legal system should be established immediately, and all reactionary laws should be abolished.</p>
<p>Article 4, Clause 7: Both parties confirm that all armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government (all army, navy, air force, gendarmerie, transportation police units, local units, all military organs, schools, factories, and rear logistics institutions, etc.) should be reorganized into People's Liberation Army in accordance with democratic principles. After the signing of the Domestic Peace Agreement, a national reorganization committee should be established immediately to be responsible for this reorganization work. The reorganization committee shall consist of seven to nine members, of which four to five will be sent by the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and three to four will be sent by the Nanjing National Government, with one as the director and one of the members sent by the Nanjing National Government as the deputy director. Regional reorganization committee branches may be established as needed in the areas where the People's Liberation Army has arrived and taken over. The ratio of the number of people on both sides in this branch and the sharing of the director and deputy director are the same as in the national reorganization committee. A reorganization committee should be established for the reorganization of the navy and air force. All matters concerning the People's Liberation Army's advance and takeover of the areas currently under the jurisdiction of the Nanjing National Government shall be prescribed by order of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. When the People's Liberation Army advances, the armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government shall not resist. Clause 8: Both parties agree that the reorganization plan for each region shall be carried out in two stages: Item 1, the first stage is the centralized reorganization stage, Point 1: All armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government (army, navy, air force, gendarmerie, transportation police corps, and local units, etc.) should be concentrated for reorganization. The reorganization principle should be determined by the reorganization committee based on the actual conditions of each region. In the areas where the People's Liberation Army has arrived and taken over, they should be ordered to go to the designated locations for centralized reorganization in zones and phases according to their original numbers, original organization, and original number of people. Point 2: All armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government should be responsible for maintaining local order and preventing any sabotage incidents in the large and small cities, traffic arteries, rivers, seaports, and villages where they are stationed before the People's Liberation Army has arrived and taken over. Point 3: When the People's Liberation Army arrives and takes over in the above areas, the armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government should peacefully hand over according to the orders of the reorganization committee and its branches, and go to the designated locations. During the march to the designated locations and after arrival, the armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government should strictly abide by discipline and not disrupt local order. Point 4: When the armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government leave their original驻地in accordance with the orders of the reorganization committee and its branches, the local police or security forces stationed there should not withdraw, and should be responsible for maintaining local public security and accept the command and orders of the People's Liberation Army. Point 5: During the period of mobilization and concentration of all armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government, their food, clothing, and other military supplies shall be resolved by the reorganization committee and its branches and local governments. Point 6: All military organs belonging to the Nanjing National Government (from the Ministry of National Defense to the organs, schools, factories, and warehouses belonging to the United Rear Service Headquarters), all military equipment (military ports, fortresses, air force bases, etc.), and all military materials should be transferred to the People's Liberation Army and its local military control committees in zones and phases according to the reorganization committee and its branches. Item 2, the second stage is the regional reorganization stage, Point 1: After the army troops belonging to the Nanjing National Government (infantry troops, cavalry troops, special forces troops, gendarmerie troops, transportation police troops, and local troops) are concentrated for reorganization in designated locations in zones, the reorganization committee should formulate a regional reorganization plan based on the actual conditions of each region and implement the reorganization on a regular basis. The principle should be to reorganize all the above-mentioned army troops that have been concentrated and reorganized into regular troops of the People's Liberation Army in accordance with the democratic system and regular organization of the People's Liberation Army. Those soldiers who are old, weak, disabled, and found to be true, and who need to retire and volunteer to retire, and those officers who volunteer to retire or change careers (the following text goes to the second edition)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Executive Yuan convened a provisional administrative meeting at 9 p.m. on the 20th, presided over by President He Yingqin, and reported in detail on the process of the peace talks and the full text of the reply telegram to the CCP, and briefly discussed issues related to relocation and evacuation.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] President of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin attended the Legislative Yuan at 4:15 p.m. on the 20th to report on the progress of the Peiping peace talks, the CCP's demands, and the government's reply, which lasted for an hour. The preamble and eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the draft peace agreement proposed by the CCP, as well as the government's telegram replying to the CCP on the 20th, were read out by He at the meeting. He first said: In order to promote peace, the government sent a peace talk delegation to Peiping to conduct consultations with the CCP representatives. From April 1 to 12, there were many twists and turns, especially on the 9th, when it almost broke down. Later, after direct consultations with Mr. Mao Zedong, it turned around and continued. A formal meeting was held on the 13th, and the CCP immediately proposed a draft peace agreement of eight articles and twenty-four clauses. The government delegation believed that it had to ask the central government for instructions before a decision could be made, and immediately sent representatives Huang Shaohong and advisor Qu Wu to return with the draft peace agreement for the government to study countermeasures. He concluded: The conditions proposed by the CCP have lost the peace plan based on equality and seem to be determined by the victors for the conquered, so the government cannot accept it and has telegraphed the reply to the government representatives in Peiping on the afternoon of the 20th to convey to the CCP.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Legislative Yuan held a provisional closed-door meeting on the afternoon of the 20th to hear President He's report on the peace talks. After listening to President He's report, the committee members unanimously expressed their support for the government's position and attitude on the peace talks, and believed that the government's attitude was completely correct.</p>

As of 8 p.m. on the 20th, when the military was communicating with the city by wireless telephone, except for the east of the city, where fighting was still taking place in the Wohushan and Machang areas 2-3 li from the city, and the position remained unchanged, the southern line had shifted to a cigarette factory less than half a li from the city, the north had shifted to a factory area 6-7 li from the city, and the west had also shifted to 4-5 li from the city. External transportation was therefore completely cut off. Director Yan Xishan was very nervous and heavy-hearted after hearing the news in Nanjing.</p>

This is a very interesting mythological temple fair. According to legend, A'yi Banma is a female monster who specializes in eating people, especially lamas. The leader of Lamaism could not subdue her, so he detained her beloved son. She immediately begged the leader of Lamaism to release him. The leader, with compassion, not only released her son but also agreed that A'yi Banma would no longer harm living beings and would regard Kumbum Monastery as her mother's home, returning to her hometown once every three years and a grand visit once every six years to collect food, gold, and silver, which has continued to this day.

<h3 id="e21">Jiangbei Communist Army Launches Full-Scale Offensive: Battles Erupt Across Anqing to Guazhou, Cannon Fire Reaching the Capital Throughout the Night <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Prior to receiving a response from the government regarding the demands of the Chinese Communists, it was reported on the afternoon of the 20th that the Communist authorities had launched a full-scale offensive across the Jiangbei front. The rumbling of artillery fire has penetrated the capital city's atmosphere of peace. The government has decided to hold an important meeting on the 21st to decide on crucial policies such as relocation and response.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] This reporter has learned that after the Chinese Communists issued a general offensive order on the night of the 20th, a telephone conversation was held with a senior military general at 00:10 on the 21st. According to the conversation, from Anqing in the west, passing through Erba, Yuxikou, Xiliangshan, Jiangpu, Huaqiying, Shierxu, to Guazhou and other bridgehead positions on the Jiangbei front, battles have occurred successively since the night of the 20th. Among them, the battles at Yuxikou, Jiangpu, and Shierxu are particularly fierce, with no changes in the Nationalist army's positions.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Amidst the faint hope of peace talks, rumbling cannon fire was heard again from across the capital's riverbank starting in the evening of the 20th. Standing on the rooftop platform of the Fuchi Building, this reporter could even remotely see the white light of artillery shells forming arcs as they were fired, one after another. As a result, the capital's residents once again felt a sense of tension. According to information obtained by this reporter from the military, two regiments of Wu Huawen's troops from the 35th Army of Chen Yi's forces, starting tonight, launched a fierce attack on the Jiangpu city bridgehead from two directions, the Tangquan town and Liuzhuang areas southeast of Quanjiao. After the Nationalist army's Liu Bingzhe unit fought back, and multiple air force planes took off in the dark to drop bombs, and the navy also provided artillery support from the river surface, the fighting was still continuing in the suburbs two or three *huali* away as of 10 p.m. on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] The Jiangpu battle had moved to within 200-300 meters outside the city by around 1 a.m. on the 21st. The attacking Communist forces are constantly increasing in number. Although the defending troops are outnumbered, they are still fighting valiantly under the coordination of the navy and air force. The sound of artillery fire has not ceased here throughout the night.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] As of 8 p.m. on the 20th, the Nationalist army controls the following bridgeheads downstream from Anqing in Jiangbei: (1) Anqing, (2) Yuxikou and Erba across from Wuhu, (3) Xiliangshan northwest of Dangtu across the river, (4) Jiangpu, (5) the Liangpu area (including Pukou, Puzhen, Huaqiying) across from Xiaguan, (6) Huazikou (across from Qixia Mountain), (7) a narrow area west of Zhenjiang, stretching from Shierxu through Guazhou to Liuxu.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] Fierce fighting has continued unabated since the night of the 19th in both the Beishazhou east of Yangzhou and Shierxu southwest of Yangzhou. On the Beishazhou front, the Communist army continued to launch a fierce landing attack on the southern part of Beishazhou under the cover of artillery fire on the night of the 19th. The local Nationalist army team defending the island, ultimately outmatched in strength, fought valiantly until the morning of the 20th and then actively withdrew to Yangzhou under the cover of the navy and air force. On the Shierxu front, the blitz offensive launched by the Communist army in the past three days has been frustrated due to the strong counterattack by the defending troops and the Nationalist navy and air force, resulting in heavy casualties. The offensive has weakened since this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 20th] The situation at the Liuxu bridgehead, across the river from Zhenjiang, tightened last night. At 9 p.m., fierce fighting broke out on the eastern, western, and northern sides of the Liuxu outpost. After the defending troops bravely fought back, the Communist army failed to succeed and retreated slightly. Furthermore, civilian houses in Changjiaqiao, two *li* north of Liuxu, and the Gaoxu embankment in the northwest corner were set ablaze and burned down by Communist artillery shells. Today, the front line in Jiangbei returned to quiet during the day, with no major activity around Shierxu and Guazhou.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] More than a thousand Communist boats of various types are gathered in Tuqiao across from Tongling and in the Liujiadu and Taiyangzhou areas downstream. Starting at 5 p.m. on the 20th, the Communist army on the north bank began shelling the Nationalist army's positions between Tongling and Digang on the south bank, attempting to cover the forced crossing of these boats to the south. The Nationalist army's artillery on the south bank, in coordination with the navy, responded with artillery fire. The artillery battle was still in progress as of late evening.</p>
<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 20th] The outskirts of Anqing, which had been quiet for many days, saw the resurgence of fierce fighting starting on the night of the 20th. At the same time, there was brief contact at Erba, Yuxikou across the river from here, and Xiliangshan downstream yesterday. After being repulsed, the Communist army's 30th and 25th Armies launched a large-scale attack again tonight. After being ambushed by the Nationalist army's Yang Gancai unit, the fighting is still ongoing. It is reported that the Communist forces gathered in the Chao, Chu, and He counties area number up to seven armies.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] According to a Hangkou dispatch from the Military News Agency, the Chinese Communist army has been generally shifting east in recent days. A four-line slogan is currently popular within their army: (1) Liquidate Shanghai, (2) Break through Nanjing, (3) Crush Guangzhou, (4) Isolate Wuhan. The Nationalist army is paying close attention to this.</p>

<h3 id="e22">How Will the People Save Themselves? <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the government replied to the Chinese Communist's final ultimatum as scheduled, requesting the Chinese Communists, for the sake of the people's interests, to reconsider their attitude and revise the eight articles and twenty-four clauses of their so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement." At the same time, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang also issued a solemn statement regarding these clauses, explaining the responsibility for the years of war and requesting an immediate ceasefire and revision of the clauses by the central government to facilitate the peace talks. It can be seen that the government and the Kuomintang still earnestly hope that the door to peace talks will not be closed, and the overall situation of China, whether it be peace or war, still hinges on a single thought of the Chinese Communists.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist's eight articles and twenty-four clauses were formally announced by the government last night. Whether the content is harsh is obvious to all. What the general public wants to ask is: Since the government claims that the Chinese Communist's clauses are unequal, unreasonable, and not an attitude of peace talks, and requests the Chinese Communists to reconsider and first cease fire, what will the Chinese Communists do next? In fact, judging from yesterday's situation, it can be predicted that the Chinese Communists will strengthen their offensive and attempt to cross the river in one go. What we want to ask is not whether the Chinese Communists are determined to attack, nor when the government should respond, but how the people themselves can exert their power to save themselves?</p>
<p>The Chinese Communists constantly invoke the "liberation" of the people as their slogan. Then, what the people suffer from the most today is undoubtedly the war, that is, what they most need to be "liberated" from is the suffering of war. Why, after peace talks have been going on for two weeks, has the cannon fire of the Communist army attempting to cross the river not only not stopped, but has become increasingly fierce? Is it necessary to do so to be called "liberating" the people? When the Political Consultative Conference was about to convene in the winter of the 34th year, the Chinese Communist representative Zhou Enlai insisted that a ceasefire must be ordered first, otherwise it would be deemed as having no sincerity for peace. Therefore, the National Government issued a ceasefire order on January 10th of the 35th year, allowing the Political Consultative Conference to finally achieve results. (Later, the Chinese Communists did not fulfill the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, which is another matter.) Why has the government repeatedly requested a ceasefire before the start of this round of peace talks, but the Chinese Communists have ignored it and instead sent large numbers of troops from North China to the south, preparing to cross the river in a large-scale attack? Is this large-scale attack a symbol of peace? The Chinese Communists have a preface of thousands of words before the eight articles and twenty-four clauses, severely criticizing the Kuomintang and assigning them the blame for the war. We are unwilling to defend the Kuomintang, and we will not even discuss the question of who is responsible for the war, but the responsibility for not being willing to cease fire today clearly lies with the Chinese Communists. No matter how hard they try to explain, they cannot justify it. Is this not because the Chinese Communists are proud of their victory and treat the war as a game? How many times have they truly considered the suffering of the people?</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Communists do not care about the suffering of the people and have already launched attacks to cross the river along the Jiangbei coast, today's situation is that the Chinese Communists are challenging and the government will be forced to respond. For the past three and a half months, the peace that the people of the whole country have shouted themselves hoarse to call for, the peace that President Chiang and Acting President Li have sought at the cost of resignation and humiliation, has finally been destroyed by the rumbling cannons and raging flames of the Chinese Communists yesterday. The atmosphere of peace and harmony guided by President Chiang's original proclamation has left our people with only a dream of peace. Who is dedicated to seeking peace? Who is destroying peace? At this point, it is not difficult to obtain a clear proof. Previously, some people may have thought that the government's sincerity was not enough, but given Acting President Li's forbearance and humble appeal to the Chinese Communists, it cannot be said that the government's sincerity in seeking peace is insufficient. However, even this is not enough to move the arrogant Chinese Communists. Even Acting President Li, President He of the Executive Yuan, and the members of the Peace Issues Committee all believe that what the Chinese Communists have proposed is not peace terms, but the verdict of the victors on the vanquished. Then, how will we, the people, save ourselves from those warmongering Chinese Communists who do not give us peace?</p>
<p>To be honest, the Chinese Communist's final ultimatum, the so-called eight articles and twenty-four clauses, cannot be regarded as a peace agreement, nor is it merely a verdict on the government and the Kuomintang, but it is a disposition on the Republic of China and the 450 million people. It wants to disarm all the naval and air forces that defended the country during the eight-year War of Resistance and reorganize them into a Communist army that worships Marxism-Leninism; it wants to form a coalition government controlled solely by the Chinese Communists and abolish all previous laws, including the Constitution of the Republic of China; it wants to confiscate all large-scale factories and liquidate the property of all people above a certain amount; it wants to take over all government agencies and subject all service personnel to communist ideological training; it accuses the United States, the ally that helped us the most during and after the war, and wants to cut off the friendly relations between China and the United States by abolishing the "traitorous treaties," leaving China isolated and without assistance in the future. In short, if the government is forced to have its peace representatives sign this ultimatum of the Chinese Communists, then China will inevitably become a communist state supported by the Red Army and be locked behind the Iron Curtain. National independence and people's freedom will all be sacrificed to this agreement without anyone realizing it. Fortunately, the government authorities have the courage of responsible people, and for the long-term interests of the country and the people, they are unwilling to sign rashly, but demand that the Chinese Communists change their attitude, thus preserving a glimmer of hope for our country and people.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the government is forced to respond to war in the future, it will be fighting for the independence of the country, fighting for the freedom of the people, and also fighting for the true and lasting peace that we seek. This unavoidable response is of great importance to the interests of the people, and we, the people, have no reason to stand by idly, especially the peace-loving and freedom-loving people have no reason to be indifferent. Then, if the flames of war extend to both sides of the Yangtze River, how should we, the people, rise up to save ourselves? A twelve- or thirteen-year-old primary school student in Peiping wrote a letter to his father in Shanghai a few days ago, saying that it is now impossible to find a small room where he can breathe free air! Do we want freedom? Then save ourselves quickly!</p>
<h3 id="e23">Two British Warships Repeatedly Shelled Near the Port, Heavy Casualties, One Ship Sailed to the Capital for Repairs, British Ambassador Instructed the Consul-General in Tianjin to Protest to the Communist Side <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this City] According to British naval authorities here, this morning of the 20th, the British small warship HMS Amethyst reported by telegraph: The ship, en route from Shanghai to the capital, was shelled about eighty miles east of Nanjing in the middle of the river. There were several deaths and injuries on board, and the source of the shells is unknown. However, the ship notified the Chinese government before leaving Shanghai. The HMS Amethyst has a displacement of 2,000 tons and is commanded by Captain B.N. Skinner. Details are being investigated.</p>
<p>It is also understood that the location where the British warship HMS Amethyst was shelled is near the port, so people here generally believe that the shells that bombarded the ship came from the Communist-controlled area of Jiangbei.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 20th] The British Embassy announced at 9:30 this morning that the embassy has received a report from the British gunboat HMS Amethyst, stating that the ship encountered heavy artillery fire, ran aground, and suffered heavy casualties. The incident occurred about ten miles east of the port on the north bank of the Yangtze River, about thirty miles from Zhenjiang. Further details are awaited. It is believed here that the ship's telegram was sent under extremely critical circumstances. The British destroyers HMS Consort and HMS Black Swan have departed from the capital and Shanghai respectively to assist at the scene. HMS Amethyst was en route to Nanjing to replace HMS Consort in protecting British nationals in Nanjing. The ship has British national emblems on both sides. The ship left Shanghai on the 19th and stopped overnight in Jiangyin.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 20th] Following the shelling of the British gunboat HMS Amethyst near the port this morning by artillery fire from the Communist forces on the north bank, another British warship, the destroyer HMS Consort, was also shelled by Communist artillery fire while sailing downstream from the capital to assist the HMS Amethyst. Both ships suffered heavy casualties. The HMS Consort sailed downstream along the river. It first discovered the HMS Amethyst aground outside Taipingzhou, fifteen miles east of Zhenjiang, but was unable to provide assistance due to the intense artillery fire from the Communist forces on the north bank. The HMS Consort returned fire while accelerating downstream, arriving in Jiangyin in the afternoon, where it met the British destroyer HMS Black Swan sailing upstream from Shanghai. It is also learned that the British 10,000-ton cruiser HMS London, which was originally sailing from Hong Kong to Shanghai for a routine visit, changed course and sailed upstream after receiving the news. Vice Admiral Madden, Deputy Commander of the British Far East Fleet, is personally on board the HMS London. According to a Hong Kong dispatch, another British cruiser, HMS Belfast, sailed north from Hong Kong tonight, presumably heading to Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Reuters, this City] Authoritative sources told our agency that British Ambassador Sir Stevenson has instructed the British Consul-General in Tianjin to protest to the Communist authorities in Peiping regarding the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] A British Embassy spokesperson announced today that the British Embassy has officially notified the Ministry of National Defense regarding the "Amethyst" incident.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Direct Taxes and Commodity Taxes Changed to be Calculated Based on Index, Government Meeting Approves Implementation Measures <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] The tax system that was originally planned to be used for direct taxes and commodity taxes in the financial reform plan has been changed to be calculated based on the cost of living index in various places. The implementation measures have been approved at the political affairs meeting held at 9 p.m. on the 20th. It is learned that the measures include the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Land tobacco tax, homemade wine tax, and smoked tobacco tax are to be transferred to local governments for collection starting July 1st.</p>
<p>(2) Special business tax is to be transferred to local governments for collection starting July 1st. The securities exchange tax will continue to be collected by the central government.</p>
<p>(3) The central government's national tax collection agencies in various places should be comprehensively adjusted and merged.</p>
<p>(4) Compilers of price indexes are to calculate the price indexes used for calculating various national taxes and paying fines, with the wholesale price index as the standard. The national tax administration of each province under the Ministry of Finance will compile it jointly with the local government's competent statistical authorities. The index area will be compiled by province. The materials for compiling the index should select about 20 kinds of items that can represent universality from six categories of items: food, fiber, fuel, metals, building materials, and other miscellaneous items. Designated personnel will investigate the index daily and compile it once a week based on the price on August 19, 1948. After it is completed every Sunday, the bank acting as the national treasury will post it for announcement when the bank starts business next Monday.</p>
<p>(5) The evaluation of commodity taxes and mineral taxes is temporarily stipulated to be based on the wholesale price of the market near the place of production. The tax price and tax amount will be evaluated once every five days. If the market wholesale price fluctuates dramatically, increasing or decreasing to 25%, it can be adjusted at any time. However, the first evaluation and the first evaluation in January, April, July, and October each year will be supervised and handled by personnel sent by the National Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance. Tax-paying manufacturers plan to change to settle and pay taxes once every three days starting from May 1st, and they must pay the full amount into the treasury within two days. The amount of the fine will be changed to the pre-war standard, based on "August 19."</p>
<p>(6) Calculation and payment of direct taxes: (A) For the income tax part, the supplementary schedule (1) of the Measures for Reorganizing Finances promulgated on August 26, 1948, is restored, and the threshold for the classified income tax and the schedule of tax rates are revised. The calculation of the income tax for the first category of profit-making enterprises should be based on the income amount on the day of the end of the first or second half of the year, announced by the agent bank. For the second category, item A, the estimated income amount for remuneration from business or skills in light of the spring, summer, and autumn seasons should be based on the income amount on the day of the end of each quarter, announced by the agent bank. For the second category, item B, the calculation of fixed salary income tax should be based on the income amount converted to the August 19 base number according to the cost of living index for central government employees in each province at the time of salary payment. The calculation of the interest income tax in the third category, those who pay within the prescribed time limit should directly calculate the tax amount according to the proportional tax rate stipulated by the Income Tax Law. The calculation of the property rental income tax in the fourth category should be based on the income tax announced by the bank acting as the national treasury on the day of rent payment.</p>
<p>(B) For inheritance tax, the supplementary schedule (2) of the Measures for Reorganizing Finances promulgated on August 26, 1948, is continued, and the threshold for the inheritance tax and the schedule of tax rates are revised.</p>
<p>(C) For stamp tax, the tax rate for fixed-amount stamp duty and graded fixed-amount stamp duty will be adjusted and announced monthly by the Ministry of Finance.</p>

Regarding the results of the review of the latter bill, seven principles were revised and passed as follows: (1) The public bond is fixed at 2 million ounces of gold; (2) The public bond is forcibly allocated to wealthy households and merchants, and those who voluntarily subscribe shall be given priority rewards; (3) The public bond shall be matched with interest, and repayment by lottery shall begin after three years, and shall be cleared in five years; (4) The public bond may be used to offset property tax; (5) If those who are allocated do not pay according to the regulations, the government may sell their property to offset it; (6) In addition to gold, the public bond may be paid in foreign currency, silver, silver dollars, or gold yuan notes at the market price, and the government shall repay it in the same way; (7) The issuance of the public bond shall be expedited. The review opinions on the above two cases will be submitted to the next plenary session of the Legislative Yuan for resolution.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th] The Hong Kong Gold and Silver Exchange will resume gold market transactions on the 21st, but the buying and selling will be carried out in accordance with the methods determined by the exchange and officially approved. At the same time, gold may not be sold to people outside Hong Kong. News about buying and selling quotations or mortgages will not be published publicly thereafter. The price hikes and stock market surges caused by the ban have returned to normal after the Financial Secretary yesterday made a detailed explanation of the content of the law and denied that the government intended to forcibly purchase. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, there was a rush to open safe deposit boxes at major banks due to rumors that the government would freeze them. However, after the above news came out, there was no longer such crowding today. As for the ordinary citizens who have been worried for days that the "gold ban" will affect their own lives and that the depreciation of the Hong Kong dollar may have serious consequences, they have been uneasy. Now they have learned the truth about the law and confirmed that the rumors are unfounded, their tension has been relaxed, and their fear has disappeared.</p>

<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 20th] Changsha silver dollar broke the 600,000 mark at noon on the 20th, reaching 700,000 in the afternoon.

The highest denomination 10,000 yuan gold yuan notes on the market are also rejected, so the scattered supplements are all copper coins. However, there are too few copper coins, and supply cannot meet demand. Vendors exchange one silver dollar for three strings of copper coins, while the original value of a silver dollar is six strings. Vendors earn 50 cents for every silver dollar they change. The garrison headquarters began arresting vendors on a large scale at 6 p.m., and the sound of coins disappeared in the evening.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Twenty-three Republican senators wrote to President Truman on the 19th, requesting that Truman take action, through the United Nations, to implement the United Nations decision on resolving the Dutch-Indonesian dispute.

The letter continued: "In the debate on the passage of this amendment, the overwhelming majority of opinions in the Senate believed that the Netherlands' use of force in Indonesia, and its continuous refusal to implement the Security Council's resolutions on stopping the conflict and other steps for the peaceful resolution of the Indonesian dispute, were improper actions that violated world peace and security interests. In view of these facts, we sincerely urge the President to instruct the Secretary of State and the US delegation to the United Nations to take immediate action to ensure that the United Nations implements its resolutions on the Dutch-Indonesian conflict."

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] In the Japanese fiscal year 1949 budget bill, there was an amendment from three opposition parties, including the Socialist Party, in the Senate. The Chairman of the Budget Committee of the Senate, Kurokawa, and the members Hatano and Kanie (Socialist Party) originally planned to visit MacArthur's headquarters this morning to make a final effort on the amendment issue.

<p>[Another Dispatch] After the budget bill was passed, the Japanese government proposed to extend the parliamentary session, which would not affect the timely passage of the budget bill, and would also allow other important bills to be discussed one by one.

<h3 id="e48">Tentative Suggestions from the Soviets Regarding the Berlin Question: The United States Consults Britain and France; East Germany Could Complete Preparations for Statehood by June <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Well-informed sources here claim that recent newspaper reports of Soviet feelers towards the U.S. regarding the possibility of reopening Four-Power negotiations on the German problem if the Berlin blockade were lifted are substantially accurate. The Soviet overture was entirely informal in nature, and the outcome remains uncertain. The U.S. government has consulted with Britain and France on the matter and has sought clarification from the Soviets on the concrete steps for lifting the Berlin blockade.</p>
<p>The British position is that the blockade must be lifted before a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' conference can be convened, and the establishment of a West German government must not be halted by Four-Power negotiations. The British government will not support measures aimed solely at delaying West German political independence.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] German sources close to the Soviet military administration report that the Soviet authorities in Berlin have instructed politicians in the Soviet zone to complete plans for establishing an East German government by June 1. The arrival in Berlin of Dekanozov, the last Soviet ambassador to Germany before the war, is believed to be related to this matter. According to German newspapers, Dekanozov told Soviet zone political leaders today that once the East German government is established and a peace treaty is signed, there will no longer be any need to demand reparations. It is generally believed that East Germany will not take the final step of establishing a government until West Germany is formally established, solidifying the division of Germany. However, all technical preparations for establishing East Germany will be completed by June 1. German sources also report that elections for the German People's Congress will be held throughout the Soviet zone on May 15 and 16. After the elections, the German People's Congress will convene immediately to give final approval to the constitution. If events proceed smoothly, the establishment of the All-German Republic will be announced. British and American officials here are largely reserved about the various reports coming from the German side. They feel that reliable information regarding Soviet intentions is still lacking and therefore decline to comment on the various rumors circulating.</p>

<p>Uncertainty About Whether a Peace Treaty Can Be Achieved</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Yoshida, in response to questions from members of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee today regarding Japan's permanent neutrality, the prospects for a security treaty and peace conference, provisional arrangements for the month, and trade relations with the Chinese government, stated: (1) Reports that the Emperor met with Dr. Mott and expressed a desire for permanent neutrality are mistaken. Regarding external permanent neutrality, such as that of Belgium, although its neutrality was guaranteed by treaty, it was the first to be ravaged in the European war. Therefore, while I believe that the goodwill behind permanent neutrality is a separate matter, the example of Belgium illustrates that it should be considered with caution. In other words, it is not that external permanent neutrality is difficult, but whether it can guarantee Japan's security is questionable. If it can guarantee security, it would be fortunate for Japan. Furthermore, Japan's future security guarantees are being discussed at the peace conference, and I cannot explicitly answer in my official capacity; (2) Considering Japan's international situation, it can be said that it has improved in some respects. However, due to the opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union and other factors, it is impossible to predict whether a peace treaty can be achieved unanimously; (3) Regarding the CCP government, I have no information other than news reports. It seems that peaceful negotiations are underway, but it cannot be considered successful yet, and it is difficult to predict future developments. However, regarding relations with China, I hope to begin trade as soon as possible; (4) It is doubtful whether a movement to promote a peace conference can be launched, or whether a treaty issue review committee can be established after the parliament. If MacArthur does not consider it, the issue should be discussed separately; (5) Regarding the re-examination of the Far Eastern Commission and the resolution of the Japanese Constitution, I have not heard of anything directly. The government currently has no intention of amending the constitution."</p>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] The Political Committee today, by a vote of 17 to 1, with 31 abstentions including the U.S. and the Soviet Union, passed a motion to invite representatives from Hungary and Bulgaria to attend and explain the cases of the detention of Cardinal Mindszenty and other church leaders.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 20th Broadcast: Lake Success News, British representative Jebb and U.S. representative adopted the same position, opposing the Cuban representative's proposal to establish a fifteen-member committee to investigate the cases of accused clergy. Jebb quoted the Hungarian Yellow Book, stating that "There must have been a confession during Cardinal Mindszenty's trial. Needless to say, the confession will limit Cardinal Mindszenty to the crimes he is accused of. I believe there is no need for investigation, and I can offer many reasons to prove that it is not." New Zealand representative Berendsen also condemned the impropriety of the clergy condemnation cases, believing that such events are international issues that the UN General Assembly has the right to address.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Conflicting Opinions on Handling Former Italian Colonies: Egypt Demands to Acquire Part of the Territory <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 20th] Almost half of the UN member states have expressed their opinions on the Italian colonies, but it is difficult to predict what the final resolution of the General Assembly on this matter will be. So far, the opinions of the 29 countries that have expressed their views can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Seventeen countries support entrusting Cyrenaica to British trusteeship, while Italian Somaliland should be returned to Italy under a trusteeship agreement. Twelve countries advocate placing Tripolitania under Italian rule, while ten countries support French administration of the Fezzan region of Libya. Furthermore, most countries agree that part of Eritrea should be ceded to Abyssinia to give it access to the sea. In general, opinions in the UN General Assembly's Political Committee on the issue of Italian colonies can be divided into two camps: one advocates placing all colonies under UN trusteeship, while the other advocates individual trusteeship. The first camp, led by India, the Soviet Union, and Arab countries, has a total of eighteen votes. Although this number is not enough to pass their proposal, it is enough to prevent the other camp from obtaining a two-thirds majority needed to pass their proposal.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 19th] Egyptian Foreign Minister Khashaba submitted a small request regarding the Italian colonies to the Political Committee today. Khashaba claimed that the request was very small in terms of economics and territory, but it was important for Egypt to open up the base for foreign intrusions outside of Egypt. The land Egypt wants to acquire is the Giarabub oasis and the Sollum desert plain on the border between Egypt and Cyrenaica, because it is the natural boundary of Egypt. The Uruguayan representative proposed the formation of an eleven-member committee to draft a proposal regarding the fate of the Italian colonies. The committee did not vote on the proposal and adjourned until Wednesday.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Wage Research Committee Agrees: Index Still to be Published Twice; Payments to be Calculated Based on Silver Dollar Market Price; to be Submitted to Labor-Management Evaluation Committee for Further Discussion <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Commission's Wage Research Committee held a meeting at 2 PM yesterday in the City Hall conference room, chaired by Secretary-General Chen. First, Social Affairs Bureau Director Cao Peizi presented six proposed methods for wage research, which were submitted for discussion, including: (1) Calculate and pay wages based on the value of silver dollars, using the worker's base salary at the "August 19th" price limit, discounted by half, and then paying wages according to the market price of silver dollars at that time, thus abolishing the cost of living index; (2) Calculate and pay Gold Yuan based on the silver dollar price at the time of each bi-monthly publication of the cost of living index; (3) Publish the cost of living index twice a month. On the 8th of each month, pay wages for the 1st to the 7th according to the index from the end of the previous month, while also pre-paying wages for the 8th to the 15th; on the 23rd, pay wages for the 16th to the 22nd according to the cost of living index published on the 15th, and pre-pay wages for the 23rd to the end of the month; supplementary payments to be made when the monthly mid-month and end-of-month indices are published; (4) With reference to the current public utility salary payment method, pay half a month's salary for the 1st to the 15th based on the end-of-month index on the 5th of each month, pay one month's salary based on the index published on the 15th on the 20th, and deduct the half-month's salary borrowed on the 5th when the index is published on the 30th; (5) Implement a weekly salary system, with the index published once a week and salaries paid weekly; (6) Use in-kind goods to offset wages. Regarding the above methods, Cao stated that the issue of how to obtain a unified price for silver dollars should be considered. If wages are calculated in silver dollars, should commodity prices also be quoted in silver dollars? Next, Zhou Xuexiang, a representative of the General Labor Union, proposed three principles for salary payment: (1) Base salary discounted by half and paid in silver dollars, using Yuan coins as the standard before silver dollar prices are unified; (2) Pay silver dollars to those with silver dollars, and convert and pay Gold Yuan to those without silver dollars. Employees may not refuse; (3) Each company and factory may set its own salary payment date to avoid affecting prices on salary payment days. Subsequently, Pan Shih-hao, Tian He-qing, Lu Jing-shi, Yan E-sheng, and others expressed their opinions successively. Finally, Secretary-General Chen summarized the general opinions and decided to temporarily adopt the second method reported by Director Cao, that is, the cost of living index will still be published twice a month, and wages will be converted and paid in Gold Yuan based on the silver dollar price at the time of index publication. However, Zhou Xuexiang reiterated his opinion, requesting that the prices used in the index should be calculated based on the highest market price in the half month. If this is not adopted, the General Labor Union will refuse to send personnel to participate in meetings related to this issue. It was later decided to submit this discussion result to the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee for decision; the opinions of the General Labor Union, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Municipal Industrial Association will be submitted to the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee for review. The meeting adjourned at 4 PM.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union convened its third Standing Committee meeting at 10 AM yesterday. The meeting was attended by Zhou Xuexiang, Sun Wenyuan, Qiu Changjiang, Huang Yuexiang, Fang Rusheng, Ye Xianggao, and others. The meeting was chaired by Zhou Xuexiang. The important resolutions are as follows: (1) Measures to solve the current threat to employees' livelihoods: 1. Employees' salaries should be paid in silver dollars, discounted by half from the base salary in Gold Yuan (calculated in Yuan coins before silver dollar prices are unified). 2. If employers do not have enough silver dollars to pay salaries, they should convert and pay Gold Yuan according to the market price on the day of payment. Employees may not refuse. 3. Employees' salaries should be paid by industry and on different days to avoid banknote shortages, panic buying, and stimulating price increases. However, the original salary payment date agreements between labor and management should not be changed at will. 4. After the implementation of the weekly salary system, the first and third salary payments of the month should be used as advance payments, which should be settled in the second and fourth salary payments. (2) Secretary-General Liang Yongzhang will go abroad to participate in the Asian Labor Conference. The position of Secretary-General will be temporarily filled by Deputy Secretary-General Sun Wenyuan. (3) Liang Yongzhang and Shui Xiangyun will go abroad to participate in the Asian Labor Conference. The vacancy for a member of the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee will be temporarily filled by Sun Wenyuan and Fang Rusheng.</p>
<p>Another news: General Labor Union representatives Zhou Xuexiang, Fang Rusheng, Sun Wenyuan, and Huang Yuexiang jointly issued the following statement yesterday regarding their attendance at the City Government's wage issue meeting: "Since the devaluation of the Gold Yuan and the rampant rise in prices, the average cost of living index has deviated greatly from the actual prices and cannot be used as the standard for wage payments. This is an undeniable fact. Representatives from various industry labor unions have come to the Union one after another, requesting that salaries be converted into silver dollars at half of the Gold Yuan base salary, which is a permanent solution. We have made suggestions to the Municipal Government authorities and have been discussing the matter for days. All parties believe that it is indeed necessary to convert and pay wages based on the value of silver dollars, but before it is implemented, there is an urgent need for a transitional measure. Today, the City Government reconvened the Industrial Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and representatives from this Union to hold a meeting (omitted). The measures stipulated by Acting Mayor Chen are beneficial in maintaining the value of the currency after the publication of the cost of living index, but the issue of how to bring the index closer to prices, which is of great concern to all parties, has not yet been resolved. Therefore, while we can accept the section proposed by Acting Mayor Chen, it is only considered a reasonable solution if the compilation of the index reaches the highest price of each period, as proposed by this Union in the past, as the salary index. Otherwise, we did not participate in the vote on the decision and cannot be held responsible for it. In short, we believe that this case is of great importance, and we are not adhering to our own opinions. We dare not act rashly because we are worried about the situation, and we are afraid that all sectors of society will not understand the truth. Therefore, we make this joint statement."</p>
<h3 id="e58">Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters Sends Telegram to the Whole Country in Response to the Five Principles of the Central Executive Committee: Striving for the Realization of Comprehensive, Reasonable, Honorable and Peaceful Peace <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The Kuomintang Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, in order to support the five principles statement of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, yesterday (20th) sent a telegram to the whole country, stating as follows:</p>
<p>To all provincial and municipal party headquarters, all overseas party headquarters, all newspapers, and to be forwarded to all groups and compatriots throughout the country for your consideration: Since Generalissimo Chiang initiated peace and retired to his hometown, and Acting President Li has spared no effort to sincerely seek peace, the People's Representatives have flown north several times to negotiate, and the peace talks have begun. For several months, the government and the Party have endured humiliation and sought compromise in every possible way, making concessions again and again, all in order to achieve the genuine and comprehensive peace that the people of the country have been praying for day and night. However, the CCP initially abused and insulted the Party and the government. Then, they threatened us with Mao Zedong's eight conditions. Now, they are creating further complications and intensifying their demands, proposing so-called 24 articles and setting a deadline for the government to respond, as if it were an ultimatum. At the same time, they went back on their word and stopped fighting, and launched a fierce attack on the Kuomintang army's bridgehead in Jiangbei, trapping our Yonganzhou, Gaoqiao and other places. They also began large-scale sneak crossings northeast of Zhenjiang, intending to force the government to surrender through both political and military means. Their intentions are extremely vicious. The conditions are even more harsh, which can be said to be unprecedented in China and abroad. This is intolerable, who can tolerate it? The concessions made in peace talks must have a minimum limit, and the attainment of peace must also have a basic scope. Beyond this, it is not seeking peace, but forcing surrender; beyond this, it is not peace, but treason. The Central Executive Committee of the Party yesterday made a consistent statement on the current peace talks, that the name of the Republic of China cannot be changed, the basic freedoms and rights of the people enshrined in the Constitution cannot be deprived, the integrity and independence of national sovereignty cannot be harmed, and social and economic reforms cannot be carried out by violent means. This is the minimum standard for governing the country, appealing to the whole country and making it public to the world. All the points raised are not only the foundation of our country, but also the minimum requirements for the lives of our people. They are not only fair and just, but also reasonable and in line with human feelings. They are not only the views of our Party comrades, but also the common aspirations of all righteous people in the country. If the CCP blindly believes in the omnipotence of force, and still considers even these minimum requirements unacceptable, and ignores public opinion and the lives of the people, and insists on crossing the river, then the responsibility for destroying the peace talks is already very clear. Party comrades and compatriots throughout the country, in order to be loyal to the Party, protect the Party, and defend our homes and country, we can only rise up together and make a final stand with the CCP. We would rather be jade shattered than tile complete. We would rather die for justice and freedom than live as subjugated slaves. At this critical moment in the peace talks, this Committee did not dare to remain silent. Therefore, we specifically send a telegram to at home and abroad, in addition to responding to the five principles of the Central Executive Committee, and we hope that Party comrades at home and abroad, and compatriots throughout the country, will unite and sacrifice and fight together for this goal, in order to strive for the realization of a comprehensive, equal, reasonable, honorable and peaceful peace. Then the Party will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. Printed by the Executive Committee of the Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to manage silver dollar trading and rectify the city's appearance, the Social Affairs Bureau has drafted provisional measures for the management of silver dollar trading. The main points are as follows: (1) These measures are formulated in accordance with the principle of allowing the circulation of silver dollars as stipulated in the amended financial reform plan of the Ministry of Finance. (2) All banks in this city that have a business license from the Ministry of Finance (including trust companies and money shops), companies and firms that have a company license from the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the Ministry of Industry and Commerce or a business registration certificate from the Social Affairs Bureau, and vendors who have a permit from the Police Bureau who intend to operate concurrently. (3) Banks, money shops, companies, and firms should prepare an application in duplicate, together with the company's business license or business registration certificate, and attach two photos, and submit it to the Social Affairs Bureau for a license. Vendors should prepare an application, together with the vendor's permit and a four-inch photo, and three recent one-inch photos of the vendor, find a reliable shop as a guarantor, and apply to the Police Bureau for approval. Those who have not obtained a company license and a vendor's permit can also apply, but they must add a capital certificate, the amount of capital must be more than 50 silver dollars, and a bank, money shop, or reliable shop must act as a guarantor. (4) Silver dollar prices and trading permits should be displayed in a conspicuous place. Vendors will be issued number plates, which should be worn on the body. (5) A seal of the bank, shop or firm will be stamped when selling silver dollars. (6) After the Social Affairs Bureau has formulated the measures, it will submit them to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation. Within one week after the promulgation, the application procedures will be completed. Otherwise, it will not be allowed to operate silver dollar trading concurrently.</p>

<p>In order to understand the actual difficulties of the industrial sector in the city and to actively find ways to store raw materials for June, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from 44 industries in the city a month ago to inquire about the sources of industrial raw materials for each factory and the actual situation of each industry. It is now learned that the Social Affairs Bureau has completed the investigation last week. Wang Jiashu, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Bureau, told reporters yesterday that all industries have common difficulties, especially the machinery and steel industries. The raw material merchants do not have enough of various raw materials in their hands. After checking, it was found that there are two difficulties: (1) Domestic raw materials such as tobacco, cowhide, coking coal, and soybeans have always been imported from North China, but recently, due to the political situation and transportation relations, it is impossible to communicate and purchase. (2) For foreign raw materials, most manufacturers are unable to settle foreign exchange due to economic reasons. The foreign exchange for the seventh and eighth seasons has not yet been settled, and some of the foreign exchange for the fifth and sixth seasons has not yet been settled. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau is now preparing to submit the above situation to the Municipal Government and request that it be discussed in the Economic Joint Report, and that the Central Government be requested to provide raw material loans or find ways to settle foreign exchange on its behalf, so as to avoid the collapse of the city's industry.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Minister of Economic Affairs Hosts Business and Industry Leaders; Listens to Opinions as Policy-Making Reference; Barter Trade Between North and South Should Adopt Comprehensive Method; Unworkable Laws to Be Abolished <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Minister of Economic Affairs Sun Yueqi hosted leaders from various sectors of business and industry in this city at the Textile Association yesterday at 4:00 PM to listen to their opinions, as a reference for policy-making. The tea party took place in a harmonious atmosphere and concluded around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the reception, Minister Sun stood up and gave a speech, stating: "Since the government announced my appointment as Minister of Economic Affairs, I have been waiting for the ministry's organizational structure to be determined, so I have only now been able to come to Shanghai. I would like to take this opportunity to ask for your insights on industry, commerce, and the economy. If there is anything the government can do to help, it will do its best. Likewise, if you have the ability to assist the government, please provide guidance. In recent years, the economy and finance have failed to coordinate, so I hope that in the future, the economy, finance, and labor can all coordinate and understand each other. Under the current circumstances, I will do as much as I can, and I hope to alleviate the suffering of all industries as much as possible. I plan to establish a private industry advisory committee within the Ministry of Economic Affairs, inviting leaders from various sectors of business and industry to participate, so that I can solicit your opinions on many policies and implement them if they are feasible. I now invite you to express your valuable opinions."</p>
<p>Subsequently, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Jilong, Wang Xiaolai, Luo Qinghua, Jin Runxiang, Liu Guangyi, Pan Shihao, Xie Tiansha, Tian Heqing, Wang Xianqing, Liu Jingji, and Shou Jingwei, among others, expressed their opinions on the suffering of various industries and requested Minister Sun to find solutions.</p>
<p>Fuel Coal Supply Problem Can Be Temporarily Resolved</p>
<p>Finally, Minister Sun summarized the points and reached the following conclusions: (1) The loan for the silk reeling industry is extremely urgent. If it is delayed, it will be impossible to save the industry after the silkworms emerge as moths. For this matter, the silk reeling industry should first propose a concrete proposal and convene leaders of the industry for a meeting at 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 21st) at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the fourth floor of the Astor House Hotel, presided over by Deputy Minister Jian Guansan, to discuss solutions. (2) Regarding tea loans, it is hoped that tea industry leaders will propose feasible solutions and discuss them with Deputy Minister Jian Guansan at the same location at 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 21st). (3) Coal Supply: Since November of last year, I have been in charge of the Coal Regulation Committee and have been serving others. I will not engage in buying and selling myself. After becoming Minister of Economic Affairs, I will continue to do things in the same spirit. The coal problem can now be temporarily resolved, as 50,000 tons of medicinal coal have been negotiated. For those who use their own foreign exchange to purchase coal, approval has been granted to open it up as much as possible, and it has been requested to exempt import duties on fuel coal for two months.</p>
<p>Different Views Exist on the Abolition of Limits on Yarn and Cloth Transport to the South</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the issue of limits on yarn and cloth transport to the South, the cotton spinning and dyeing industries in this city strongly advocate abolishing them. However, while in Beijing, he received a telegram from Guangdong, forwarded by Acting President Li, stating that Guangdong had a surplus of yarn and cloth and needed to export it. Therefore, there were different views on whether to abolish them. At that time, he entrusted Zhang Zihe and others to study the matter, believing that the quota was originally set to prevent smuggling in Hong Kong. However, regarding this matter, it is still hoped to solicit the opinions of leaders in the industry. I do not want to act rashly. As long as everyone has a unified opinion and I can do it, I will do my best. (5) I have always advocated for trade between the North and South, as Shanghai is a manufacturing center and needs to obtain raw materials from abroad. However, I believe that barter trade between the North and South should adopt a comprehensive barter method, and not specify that a certain item must be bartered for a certain other item. (6) The Trademark Bureau is currently actively improving itself and plans to appoint Wu Chengluo as director. In the future, it will specially research ways to improve the process of searching trademarks.</p>
<p>Seeking the Interests of the Public; Serving the Enterprise</p>
<p>(7) Please provide more opinions on laws that are difficult to implement. After verification, a decision will be made to abolish them. For example, the Tungsten and Antimony Procurement Method of the National Resources Commission, which was passed by the Executive Yuan, has now been approved for cancellation by the Executive Yuan. Once it is passed by the Legislative Yuan, it can be formally abolished. (8) Regarding the issue raised by the import and export industry that the foreign exchange transfer rate is too far from the market price of the U.S. dollar, this matter is related to finance. In addition to economics and finance, today's matters often also have a military component, making the Minister of Economic Affairs seem insignificant. However, I will still do my best to solve the problem. (9) The raw materials needed by the steel industry, pig iron, must wait for barter trade with North China. There is a surplus of coking coal produced in Pingxiang, so it is necessary to find a way to increase the transportation volume of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which may solve part of the problem. (10) For all other issues, I still hope that all sectors will provide more guidance. I have no preconceived notions and will always take the interests of the public as my own and serve the enterprise.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Two British Warships Attacked in Succession; Continued from Page Two <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Report</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 20th] According to a spokesperson for the Second Fleet Command of the Chinese Navy in Zhenjiang, the "Amethyst" was attacked by communist artillery fire between the port and Sanjiangying at 8:00 AM this morning. Soldiers of the 51st Army of the Nationalist Army on the south bank saw the ship being fired upon. The ship displayed the British flag. After being hit, it stopped and raised a white flag. The 51st Army mistakenly believed that the ship was a Chinese warship and immediately telegraphed the Zhenjiang headquarters for instructions on what action to take. However, the Second Fleet Command of the Chinese Navy informed the 51st Army that it was unaware of the "Amethyst" sailing upstream and that there were no Chinese warships nearby. Therefore, the 51st Army did not fire from the south bank to provide cover. After a while, the "Amethyst" weighed anchor and sailed upstream towards Nanjing, but the communist army on the north bank immediately opened fire again. The ship may have sunk.</p>
<p>British naval personnel here expressed doubt about the 51st Army's claim that they saw the "Amethyst" raise a white flag. They believe that the ship raised another white sign to prove its British identity. Before the "Consort" found the "Amethyst," a British Air Force plane that was responsible for delivering diplomatic documents between Nanjing and Hong Kong, as well as a Chinese Air Force reconnaissance plane, were dispatched to search. A Chinese naval gunboat was also dispatched, but none were found. Furthermore, although the "Consort" found the "Amethyst" had run aground, it has not yet been determined whether the ship ran aground due to being hit or to avoid artillery fire by maneuvering.</p>
<p>The British Embassy here clarified that the "Amethyst" was sailing to Nanjing to undertake the task of evacuating foreigners in Nanjing in the event that the Nationalists and Communists peace talks broke down.</p>
<p>Statement by British Navy in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Reuters, This City] The British naval authorities here issued the following statement regarding the incident of British warships being attacked on the Yangtze River today: The British warship "Consort," sailing downstream from Nanjing to assist the British warship "Amethyst," has arrived in Jiangyin, carrying several injured personnel. The British warship "Black Swan" has also arrived in Jiangyin and will provide medical assistance to the injured, as it has doctors and medical equipment specially brought from Shanghai. The British heavy cruiser "London" is expected to arrive in Jiangyin at 9:00 PM tonight. Vice Admiral Madden, Deputy Commander of the British Far East Fleet, is personally on board the "London." The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon but changed course after receiving the news. The "Amethyst" was attacked while transporting supplies needed by the British Embassy to Nanjing. The first ship to rush to the rescue was unable to provide assistance due to the artillery fire.</p>
<p>[Reuters, This City] A British naval spokesman here told our agency that, as of now, it cannot be officially confirmed whether the attack on British warships in the Yangtze River was the responsibility of the Chinese Communists or whether the shells were actually fired from the north bank of the Yangtze River. However, the spokesman confirmed that the British warship "Consort" did return fire in the direction from which the shells were fired. He also said that it is not yet known whether the "Amethyst" is still under attack. Furthermore, according to informed sources, the British Navy is attempting to contact the Chinese Communists to demand that they cease their attacks.</p>
<p>"Consort" Returned Fire</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 20th] According to foreign inspectors who inspected the Yangtze River by plane, the British destroyer "Consort" was bombarded by communist artillery positions, and the ship returned fire.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] The British Admiralty announced on the 20th that when the British warship "Amethyst" was attacked, it exchanged fire with coastal artillery batteries along the river.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Foreign air observers today saw the British destroyer "Consort" engaged in a gun battle with communist shore batteries in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, 15 miles downstream from where the "Amethyst" ran aground. From the air, the "Amethyst" showed no signs of movement.</p>
<p>Number of Casualties on Both Ships</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 20th] According to recently obtained unconfirmed reports, 20 sailors from the British warship "Amethyst" have been taken to the Zhenjiang Chinese naval hospital after being hit by communist artillery fire. Another 25 sailors on the British warship "Consort" were also injured. The Chinese military authorities in Zhenjiang have dispatched troops to escort the 60 British naval personnel on the "Amethyst" to a safe area. Furthermore, according to a telegram from Zhenjiang, 20 people died and 20 were seriously injured on the British warship "Amethyst" after being attacked. Another 65 people have been evacuated to Taipingzhou.</p>
<p>Badger Calls Meeting</p>
<p>[Associated Press, This City] Admiral Badger, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, convened a meeting at the flagship "Eldorado" at 2:00 PM on the 20th with Rear Admiral Crawford, Commander of the U.S. Navy in Shanghai, and Robert, P. Clark, U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, which may have discussed the British warship "Amethyst" being bombarded.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Building a Great Wall of Flood Defense: The Haining Chenwengang Seawall Project <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Huang Xingtan</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Hangzhou, 17th] The car travels along the Qiantang River, deep into the wilderness. On both sides of the road, in the fields, lush vegetation thrives. Mulberry trees are growing tender, green new leaves. The withered stalks of perilla still remain in the ridges. Pea flowers bloom like butterflies on the slopes of the road. Yellow rape flowers spread their fragrance on the spring breeze. Villages are scattered, partially visible through the bamboo forests. Men wear straw hats, and women wear blue-patterned headscarves, all working diligently under the bright sunshine. This is truly the beautiful and simple countryside of Jiangnan. The Qiantang River is so serene, the water flowing silently, carrying countless sails forward without end, and occasionally splashing against the banks, creating crisp sounds, singing the beauty of the countryside. Ah, what a beautiful natural scene! But when the vast river refuses to be confined by its bed, the waves will surge into angry tides, crashing against the banks with overwhelming force, swallowing the land, houses, and lives on both sides. At that time, the wilderness becomes timid and trembling, and terror shrouds the land. Two years ago, the collapse of the riverbank in Nansha inundated 200,000 mu of land, with the tide invading more than ten li inland. Over 500 houses were swept away in Toupeng Town, and residents cried in despair facing the river. Last year, during the autumn tides, dozens of li of arable land in Ningxi and Yuanshou townships of Haining, as well as the Wengjiabu area, were washed away, along with 45 people and their homes and livelihoods. Over 230 households were affected by the disaster. This tragic history casts a large shadow over the millions of residents in the seven prefectures of Hang, Jia, Hu, Song, Su, Chang, and Tai in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, affecting their safety.</p>
<p>The Qiantang River Tide</p>
<p>While it attracts the curiosity of people across the country and even the world, it remains a great threat to the millions of people on both sides. Ever since the Tang and Song dynasties, tidal disasters have been endless. During the Qianlong era of the Qing dynasty, the national treasury was emptied to build seawalls. On the north bank, from Shangsi Township in Hang County to Jin Sinang Bridge in Pinghu, the seawall stretched 190 kilometers. On the south bank, from Linpu Town in Xiaoshan to Shangzhen Haoba Town, it stretched 118 kilometers. This was not only hailed in history as one of China's four great engineering projects but also ensured the safety of the people of Zhejiang for over a century. However, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the seawalls were neglected and fell into disrepair. Although the Zhejiang Provincial Government established the Seawall Engineering Bureau in 1946, until the end of March of this year, when the bureau was closed and merged into the Water Conservancy Bureau, the bureau had been diligently working to replenish and repair the seawalls for two years and seven months, allowing them to weather the successive dangerous tides, and sparing the lives of people on both banks. But under the principle of addressing both the symptoms and the root causes, from protecting the banks to facilitating navigation, the Seawall Engineering Bureau has indeed brought more blessings to the people of Zhejiang. However, due to the fact that too much of the seawall was damaged "congenitally" and the difficulty in obtaining "acquired" funding, the seawall project could not be carried out as ideally planned. Some local gentry even suspected that the water diversion dam project of the Seawall Engineering Bureau was a waste of manpower and resources, and was useless. Some responsible officials also only acknowledged that the water diversion dam project above Haining was successful, and that building water diversion dams to control the river below Haining was not appropriate. For this reason, Chairman Zhou Yan specially invited engineering experts and relevant officials to discuss the urgent issue of controlling the Qiantang River. The focus of the debate was on water diversion dams. From an engineering point of view, water diversion dams are indeed an effective engineering method for controlling rivers in modern countries, but due to the difficulty of funding and the piecemeal construction, coupled with the changes in the flow of the Qiantang River and the turbulence of the tides, it is inevitable that the results have not been effective. Therefore, at present, we can only start with treating the symptoms, repairing the most important seawalls and repairing breaches, namely the Chenwengang slope seawall project and the Sibao water diversion dam bank protection project. When Haining was hit by disaster the year before last, the Seawall Engineering Bureau used firewood dams to fill the breach in Chenwengang, temporarily blocking the high tide. In the past two years, due to funding issues, only 500 meters of permanent concrete seawall have been built, and there is still a 1,604-meter breach. The Sibao water diversion dam has five sections. The Seawall Engineering Bureau has laid the foundation, but the tide is still directly impacting the dam body (the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway is built on the seawall). Therefore, the situation is very dangerous and it is necessary to rush to build a water diversion dam that extends 200 meters into the river, which requires throwing in more than 70,000 cubic meters of rock (equivalent to more than 100,000 tons). Only more than 10,000 cubic meters have been thrown in so far. Wang Huzhen, the former Deputy Director of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, once told reporters: "We engineers are like doctors, we can diagnose diseases and prescribe prescriptions, but what can we do without medicine!" The Qiantang River is Zhejiang's—one might even say Southeast China’s—rotten belly, needing a good diagnosis and treatment. Now, fortunately, this symptom-treating construction is being sponsored by the US aid fund from the Sino-American Cooperation Administration, and the Chenwengang and Sibao projects are being managed by the Engineering Office of the "Qiantang River Seawall Project US Aid Fund Supervision Committee." With the "medicine" problem solved, the project will be easier to carry out. In order to catch up with time and complete the seawall project before this year's autumn tide, the US Aid Engineering Office has decided to complete the five sections of the Sibao water diversion dam project by July 1 and the Chenwengang permanent concrete slope seawall project by the end of July. To supply the needs of the project, the Tangshan and Jianshan quarries are processing and mining rock; crushed stone from Jianshan is supplied to Chenwengang, and large rock from Tangshan is supplied to Sibao. The reporter has already reported in detail on the machine mining project in Fuyang Tangshan; the scale of the mining project in Jianshan now exceeds Tangshan. Not only is there more equipment in Jianshan than in Tangshan, including air compressors for drilling holes, generators, bulldozers, excavators, etc., but there are also six stone crushers, and a light railway has been built on the 12-kilometer distance between Jianshan and Chenwengang, with five small trains, each with twenty flatcars, which can transport 15 cubic meters, or 20 tons, of rock. From blasting the mountain to turning it into small crushed stone to loading it onto the train, all is done mechanically. Four hundred cubic meters of rock can be produced every day, of which five hundred cubic meters are crushed into gravel. In order to save time, the Jianshan quarry has been open since April 16th</p>
<p>Adding Night Shifts to Quarry</p>
<p>Jianshan is located between Haining and protrudes into Hangzhou Bay. It is only a half-hour car ride from Jianshan along the Hangzhou Bay coast to Chenwengang, Jiangbian, Dingqiao Town, Haining. Entering this large factory, which is 1,600 meters long and 250 meters wide, one becomes nervous because so many machines and workers are working so hard, doing their best to prepare for a great battle with the autumn floods! Manager Wu of the contractor, Guohua Company, told reporters: "This 1,600-meter-long cement concrete seawall requires 66,000 bags of cement, 20,000 cubic meters of gravel, 50,000 square stones, 5,100 six-inch-thick American pine board piles for the seawall foundation, 5,000 round water piles, and 60,000 round wood piles for the level. Excavating the earthwork alone requires 165,000 cubic meters. Just talking about driving piles, it would take a few days to dismantle so many incense sticks at Lingyin Temple. We have to complete the project in five months, how can we not step up our work!"</p>
<p>Not only is the work intense, but it is also the largest mechanized engineering project in Southeast China. All ditching, earth excavation, pushing, piling, pumping, and seawall construction are carried out by machines from beginning to end, but workers also cooperate with the machines to meet the needs of project progress. In this vast factory of more than 3,000 acres, there are more than 50 engineers, more than 200 technical workers, more than 4,000 male and female workers, cooperating with seven bulldozers, three trench excavators, five excavators, five pile drivers, eight cement mixers, five cranes, fourteen water pumps, more than one hundred light rail flatcars, and more than ten transport trucks… These four or five thousand horsepower machines combined with the labor of four or five thousand people form a</p>
<p>Great Collective Labor</p>
<p>Under the bright sunshine, accompanied by the sound of the river, the cranes go up and down, the bulldozers rumble, the trucks and light flatcars shuttle back and forth, and the four or five thousand workers hoeing the mud, carrying the loads, sweating and panting, the sounds of "hum, ha, ha" seem like the sound of the surging tide coming from afar, the groups of workers go up and down on the earth pits and mounds, the heads are crowded, like the rise and fall of the waves in the Qiantang River tide. In the thundering sound of the motors, in the flying ash and sand, every engineer, every worker, every machine, does its best to perform its task, cooperating into a great movement, in this movement, the flat ground becomes high ground in an instant, the mud hills become deep ditches, and huge wooden piles have penetrated deep into the ground. What a great power! Looking at such a scene, one cannot help but think of the story of building the Great Wall in ancient times, the scene must have been like this.</p>
<p>Yes, this great power is building a flood defense Great Wall, building a flood defense Great Wall for the more than 20 million people in the seven prefectures of Hang, Jia, Hu, Song, Su, Chang, and Tai. To adapt to this great project, 11 mobile wooden houses, workshops, engine rooms, material storage sheds, etc., have been built in the factory area; 5 kilometers of construction roads; 5 kilometers of light railways; 5 large and small generators, with a power generation capacity of 230 kilowatts, and 5 kilometers of power lines have been laid; more than 1,000 electric lights; 9 water listening stations, with 200 horsepower, and a water volume of more than 50 million gallons; a wireless 10-line switchboard, which can be used for communication throughout the factory area and the Chenwengang Dingqiao Town material transfer station; and a water transport terminal that can unload and transport 50,000 tons of materials. The more than 3,000 acres of the factory area is truly like a Qiantang River</p>
<p>Emerging Engineering City, proudly working in an environment of gunfire. When reporters visited, the earth excavation project had been completed by 40,000 cubic meters, and the equipment for driving base piles and board piles had also been arranged, and machine piling could be started from the 17th. If there are no special accidents, the entire project can be completed as scheduled.</p>
<p>Mao Yisheng, the former director of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, once said: "Controlling the Qiantang River is the greatest responsibility of the people of Zhejiang." But the people of Zhejiang have become so poor in the years of war. At present, the symptom-treating repair project (the Chenwengang and Sibao projects require more than one million US dollars) also relies on the strength of foreign aid; the fundamental treatment of the Qiantang River is obviously out of the question. However, when Mao Yisheng and Wang Huzhen were in charge of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, although the economic situation remained the same, they were very energetic in their work, from repairing the seawall and protecting the coast to trying to open up navigation on the Qiantang River. Now, the responsible authorities seem to lack this kind of vitality, which is a deep concern for the poor people of Zhejiang. Since the two largest symptom-treating projects have been undertaken by the US aid fund, and the Water Conservancy Bureau (Seawall Engineering Bureau) is only responsible for the design, it should devote its remaining efforts to more ambitious goals in the future. We look forward to the prosperity of Zhejiang, and therefore we must ask the responsible authorities not to forget Mao Yisheng's words: "Controlling the Qiantang River is the greatest responsibility of the people of Zhejiang." If a public servant can lead the people to complete this great task, he can be said to be great.</p>

<h3 id="e95">The Betrayal of Zhang Xianzheng, Commander of the First Traffic Police Training Regiment <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Changsha, 16th (Air Mail)] Zhang Xianzheng, the Commander of the First Traffic Police Training Regiment, mutinied in Zhuzhou on the 21st of last month, but the situation was quickly resolved. Zhang himself only managed to escape with a dozen or so men. On the first of this month, Zhang appeared in Zhugaotang, Shaoyang, and was captured by Chen Mingren's 29th Army in Xiaomen and escorted to Changsha. However, after interrogation, Zhang's so-called "mutiny" turned out to be a complete "misunderstanding." Below is Zhang's confession:</p>
<p>Zhang Xianzheng, a native of Huarong, Hunan,</p>
<p>Started as a private in the military and went through four school training sessions. He is a member of the Kuomintang. Last year, he was ordered by the Traffic Police Headquarters to establish two traffic police regiments in Hunan. Coincidentally, the Hunan Provincial Government had just issued an order to stop all National Army units from recruiting in Hunan. Zhang's recruitment work was therefore hindered. Later, after repeated explanations to Cheng Qian, directly and indirectly, he acknowledged that the troops would be established in Hunan and would be responsible for protecting their homes and villages in Hunan in the future, and would be directly under the command of the Pacification Headquarters. Only then did Cheng Qian agree. Afterwards, more than 8,000 people were recruited in various counties. At the same time, the Traffic Police Headquarters also approved the allocation of 960 carbines, 620 Thompson submachine guns, 20 heavy machine guns, 30 light machine guns, 100 rifles, and 34 revolvers. Just as he was preparing to collect them, the then-Director of the Headquarters, Wei Long, was detained, and he failed to collect them. At the same time, he was ordered by the Headquarters to go to Zhejiang to garrison. Zhang was appointed by the Headquarters, and the unit's designation was also Traffic Police, so he should obey the Headquarters' orders. He then contacted the Changsha Garrison Headquarters to collect "Royal Certificates" for collecting food anywhere during the march, but the Garrison Commander Liu Rouyuan refused to issue them because he had not received an order from the Pacification Headquarters. At this time, Cheng Qian had also gone to Nanjing, and it was impossible to negotiate. In this way, after many twists and turns, he still failed to comply with the order to set off. Later, Zhang sent Quartermaster Li Yunzhong and four others to collect food at the Headquarters' office in Hengyang. Presumably, the Headquarters' office suspected and was dissatisfied with Zhang's delay in complying with the order to set off. Not only did they not issue military food at that time, but they also detained Quartermaster Li. In this way, Zhang was in a dilemma, at a loss of what to do, and the entire</p>
<p>officers and soldiers were without food for a month. Under these circumstances, Zhang convened a meeting of all the officers and soldiers to discuss how to solve the current difficulties. At the meeting, no one had any suggestions. Finally, Xu Yulong, the Director of Personnel, came up with an idea. He said: "Today's matter is that if we don't set off, we will disobey the orders of the Headquarters, but if we set off, we will be letting down Commander Cheng. But our troops were approved by Commander Cheng, and our officers and soldiers are Hunan natives, so it's better not to set off." After Xu said this, they decided not to set off. When Cheng Qian returned to Changsha from Nanjing, Zhang immediately reported the decision not to set off and the difficult situation in person. Cheng Qian then issued an order on March 17: "The First Traffic Police Regiment of Zhang Xianzheng is approved to be reorganized into the Fifth Hunan Security Brigade. The Commander of the Regiment is hereby appointed as the Brigade Commander. It should be quickly organized into three regiments and given rations. This is to Chief of Staff Liu (Jiashu) to inform the Security Command to check and handle." Cheng also instructed Zhang in person to go to Liling to collect the firearms stored by the Traffic Police Headquarters in the warehouses there. Zhang obeyed the order and received 2,000 shi of grain and 1 million gold yuan from the Garrison Department on March 18. He got on the train early in the morning of the 19th to go to Liling. But after getting on the train, he thought about it, and Chairman Cheng had not issued a formal order, so how dare he rashly collect them? So he immediately got off the train again and rushed to the Provincial Government. At that time, Chairman Cheng had not yet gotten up, so he had to write</p>
<p>two notes, one to be presented to Chairman Cheng, and one to be handed to Secretary-General Deng Jiesong. The general idea was: I dare not take action regarding the gun matter in Liling because no order has been issued. If necessary, (I am afraid that the guns will be transported away first) I will take them first to replenish the army and report for record first.</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM, he returned to Changsha Railway Station and took the train again. When he arrived in Zhuzhou, he heard that the Headquarters had already loaded the guns from the warehouse onto the train, preparing to transport them to Zhejiang. Zhang immediately sent Major Regiment Adjutant Luo Jian to transport the 2,000 shi of grain and 1 million gold yuan to Chashi, Hengyang (the location of Zhang's troops). He himself took more than ten orderlies and rushed to Liling that night. The next morning, he investigated and found that the guns had indeed been loaded onto the train. He then ordered the station to open the carriages to Zhuzhou on the same day. After arriving in Zhuzhou (21st), he reported to Chief of Staff Liu of the Changsha Pacification Headquarters by telephone. Liu asked where the guns were now. Zhang replied that they had been transported to Zhuzhou. Liu then instructed him to transport them to Changsha immediately. He also said that Chief Tan (Chief of the Second Division of the Pacification Headquarters) had been sent to receive them. He also said that the Pacification Headquarters would be responsible for this matter, and you cannot be responsible. Zhang then waited for Tan in Zhuzhou. He did not see Chief Tan until 9:00 PM, but Cao Tieshen, the Director of the Headquarters' Hengyang Office, arrived. Zhang received a report from an orderly that Cao had brought many people. Fearing that Cao would be detrimental to him, he took an orderly to the Fuxing Bank, which was four li away from the station, to report to Deputy Commander Liu of the 29th Army. Liu was not there. As soon as he turned to leave, the streets were under curfew and no one was allowed to pass. Zhang also fell into the people's home at this time. On the 22nd, he hired a boat to Xiangtan for a price of two silver dollars. Zhang's Second Company was stationed in Xiangtan. Zhang went to the company headquarters, and instructed Company Commander Zhang Kai to publish an announcement in the newspaper</p>
<p>declaring his attitude. At the same time, he found Huang Zihua, the Commander of the 23rd Division, to discuss the matter. At this time, Zhang originally intended to go directly to Changsha to see the Chairman, but Commander Huang said that everyone outside was already saying that you had mutinied; at the same time, the other party was dissatisfied with your actions. You probably wouldn't be caught before you reached Changsha. It's better to ask someone to mediate first.</p>
<p>Zhang stayed in Xiangtan for several days and could not think of a good solution. Coincidentally, the Xiangtan newspaper reported that Hui Jian, the Chief of the First Division of the Pacification Headquarters, had gone to Dongkou to discuss Li Jingyi's way out. Because Hui and Zhang were classmates, he decided to go to Dongkou to find Hui and tell him about the incident. On the 30th, he took a car to Shaoyang. On the 31st, he arrived at Zhugaotang. Because Li Jingyi was in Shanmen, he hired a sedan to go to Shanmen. On the way, he was interrogated and captured by the 29th Army and escorted to Changsha.</p>
<p>Zhang is now being held in the Security Command. His confession is quite similar. On the 11th, the Ministry of National Defense sent a telegram to the Pacification Headquarters, requesting that he be severely punished.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Proposed Construction of Public Toilets on Qipulu and Rehe Road: Nearby Residents Urge Authorities to Strictly Ban <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor of the Shenbao Social Service Column: We are a group of small citizens living in the Qipulu and Rehe Road area. Recently, someone wanted to build a "public toilet" at the corner of those two roads. It is said that they have already obtained permission from the police authorities (?), and have already surrounded the area with fences (even enclosing the street sign standing there!). It seems that construction is about to begin. We have no way of knowing the purpose of this "public toilet." Saying that it is for the convenience of the public, but there is already a public toilet at the end of nearby Haining Road, and there is really no need to build another one. Even if you want to build one, it should not be built in such a busy traffic area. Because the road there is already narrow, if you add a building, it will inevitably hinder traffic. Moreover, the vegetable market is nearby, and if you build a "public toilet" there, flies and maggots will breed in the future, spreading epidemics, and the consequences are unimaginable. I think that person must be doing this for profit, ignoring public health and public transportation. I think the wise health and police authorities will not allow him to be so bold and reckless. We have always admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for public welfare, and we dare to ask you to expose this in your column, so as to attract the attention of the health and police authorities and ban it. Then you will be doing a great service to the small people and it will be a work of great merit. Respectfully wishing you good writing, a group of small citizens respectfully presented, April 16.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Silk Prices Still Rising Consistently <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the opening price for top-grade raw silk was advertised as high as 80 million yuan. Subsequently, KY23 bales were traded at 78 million yuan, which was 9 million yuan higher than the previous market price.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the initial asking price for rayon from the Zhongtian Bridge and Sylvania brands for immediate delivery was 38.5 million yuan. The afternoon closing price was 36.5 million yuan. Today, the opening price for futures transactions was 46 million yuan, and the closing price rose to 47.4 million yuan. Although the market trend was affected by tightening credit, confidence remained strong and buying interest was still high, up 4.4 million yuan from the previous afternoon's closing price.</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk fabric prices at Huaqiang rose to the limit. The initial opening price increased by the prescribed 20% limit, closing at 23.3 million yuan. After the market closed, over-the-counter trading initially saw prices at 28 million yuan, once rising as high as 29 million yuan, but finally dropping to 27 million yuan at the afternoon close. This was an increase of 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous afternoon's close. Other fabrics saw little fluctuation.</p>

<p>[Answer to Mr. Wang Jingjiu]</p>
<p>According to the law, a sub-landlord cannot collect a transfer fee from a third-party tenant, but in reality, this kind of bad habit does exist in this city.</p>
<p>[Answer to Mr. Hu Shiying]</p>
<p>(1) Whether inheritance tax should be paid depends on whether the deceased has an estate. If C indeed has no estate, there is no need to pay inheritance tax according to the law. (2) You can report the actual situation to the tax bureau and explain that C did not have any estate.</p>
<p>[Answer to Mr. Hua Xingzhi]</p>
<p>(1) Since I am an adult, parents are not criminally liable for my illegal acts outside the home. (2) You can publish a statement in the newspaper stating that I am personally responsible for all credit and debt relationships and that my parents are not involved.</p>
<p>Answered by Attorney Tang Mingshi</p>
<p>[Answer to Mr. Shihe] (1) If one of the parties to an engagement has been missing and their life or death is unknown for more than one year, the other party may dissolve the engagement, which is in accordance with Article 976, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Code. However, the problem lies in the proof of "missing and life or death unknown." (2) Dissolution always requires going through procedures, regardless of the reason. (3) Before the engagement is dissolved, it is not permissible to enter into another engagement with a third party. (4) If a minor's engagement is entered into on their behalf by their parents, and they do not agree to it, they must express this in a timely manner upon reaching adulthood; it is not invalid simply because it is not subsequently ratified.</p>

<p>Editor: I, the undersigned, purchased several silver dollars from someone near Xinghua Restaurant on Fuzhou Road on the 12th of this month. After paying, I lost contact due to the crowded crowd and did not receive the silver dollars. Unexpectedly, on the 15th, I learned that your newspaper arrived at Mr. Zhang Zhiyi's Yi Tai Xiang ivory store at No. 298 Fuzhou Road, and I retrieved the full amount. In this declining world with cunning and deceitful people, to find someone who does not pocket money found is truly rare. It is evidence of Mr. Zhang's loyalty and integrity, which is commendable. I have attached a silver dollar to donate to your organization's fund for helping the needy in Mr. Zhang's name, and I request that it be published in your column to encourage the prevailing customs.

<p>Theater Industry Reports the True Picture</p>
<p>[Wuxi, 18th] Feng Puren, chief secretary and social section chief of the county government, and five others went to the Queen's Theater to watch a play on the afternoon of the 17th. Because the seats were full and the show had been running for a long time, the doorman did not open the door in order to maintain order, which aroused dissatisfaction from Feng and others, leading to a full-scale brawl in which they beat the doorman. They also strung up the theater's general affairs manager, Ding Heling, when he went to the county to explain and apologize, and arrested the doorman, tied him up again, and beat him, causing a huge uproar. The community is calling for justice. The theater industry association and entertainment venues and other professional unions held a reception at the Duoyi Building for all sectors of society to report the truth, attended by Speaker Li of the Council, Supervisor Wang of the City Defense Department, Director Miao of the Police Bureau, representatives from various newspapers, and more than 300 representatives from French companies. They resolved to demand strict punishment for Feng Puren and others.</p>
<p>It is learned that the Wuxi Theater Industry Association has telegraphed Liang Qitian, chairman of the National Theater Industry Association, to demand that he uphold justice and provide unified assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Four Types of Old Foreign Currency Debt About to be Replaced with New Public Bonds <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the government's old foreign currency bonds being replaced with new public bonds, our Central News Agency reporter visited the relevant department of the Ministry of Finance, who informed us that the four types of foreign currency bonds, namely the 1938 Gold Bond English-American Gold Bonds, the 1940 Construction Gold Bond Phase I English-American Gold Bonds, the 1942 Allied Victory US Dollar Bonds, and the 1947 Short-Term (US Dollar) Treasury Bills, that remain outstanding, were originally scheduled to be replaced with Gold Yuan Public Bonds when the currency system was reformed last year. However, after the amended Gold Yuan Coupon regulations were promulgated, the statutory exchange rate of the Gold Yuan Coupon against foreign currencies changed. In order to enhance creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance formulated a plan in January of this year to replace the above four types of old foreign currency bonds with the 1949 Reorganization US Dollar Public Bonds. The draft regulations for the Reorganization US Dollar Public Bonds have also been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Once the review is passed and promulgated, and the bond certificates are printed, the procedures and deadlines for the exchange will be set, and the managing banks in various regions will be notified to handle the matter. As for the holders who have already registered with the handling banks to exchange for Gold Yuan Public Bonds and the 1948 Reorganization Public Bonds in accordance with the original plan, the temporary receipts they hold will be recalculated and exchanged for the 1949 Reorganization US Dollar Public Bonds at that time. Those who have not registered can exchange their original bonds for the 1949 Reorganization US Dollar Public Bonds in the future. The Ministry of Finance has already issued a public notice about this.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Buying Interest Far Less Than Last Week, Hua Stocks Unable to Rise <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Not reduced, the black market interest rate is above 150 yuan per thousand, but the insiders are still relatively firm, and there are very few sales from buyers. Most retail investors trade in a "scalping" manner, and sell off as soon as they make a profit.</p>
<p>At the opening of individual stocks, except for Taiwan Sugar, which is about to turn red, none of the others reached the limit price. Later, Chenghua Paint and Commercial Press also climbed to the price limit. Yongsha opened at 130 yuan, and sellers poured out, and the market fell. The lowest price was 121 yuan, and new buyers took delivery at the low price. The off-market gold price also reported an increase. The market price reached a high of 143 yuan, and the interest rate opened at a high of 155 yuan and 165 yuan. Retail investors could not bear the high interest burden, and they poured out one after another, falling back to close at 137 yuan. Meiya opened at 3.4 yuan, the lowest was 3.0 yuan, and closed at 3.3 yuan. Other stocks, except for a limited number such as Taiwan Sugar, saw a slight increase.</p>
<p>Market outlook: The evening news had more stimulating news. It was heard that the central bank did not sell gold and the money supply was tight. The counter price will turn to higher. Shortly after, the long-term market was settled for a long time, and Lin shatters the rumor of bankers getting ready to sell. The sudden drop was swift and violent. Yongsha traded at the price limit of 159 yuan, which was its new high price, and finally closed at 130 yuan, with an increase or decrease of 27 yuan. Most other stocks were stable and increased to the price limit.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Foreign Stocks See New Highs Again <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>In the foreign stock market, the insiders were more willing to take delivery and saw a new high. Yisha entered at 320,000 yuan and exited at 330,000 yuan, an increase of 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. British Union entered at 360,000 yuan and exited at 380,000 yuan, an increase of 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Yipi entered at 60,000 yuan and exited at 65,000 yuan, an increase of more than 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Due to the dark clouds of peace talks looming over the Chinese stock market, it was difficult to see an upward trend. However, the buying interest was not as strong as last week. Because the situation in Jiangbei is becoming increasingly tense, and the money supply is tight, steel and steel industries are breaking even. Asian Shipping entered at 35,000 yuan and exited at 37,000 yuan. Huade again saw a flying price, with a one-sided purchase of 1.55 million yuan, an increase of 450,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trend of foreign exchange transfer certificates hovered. The morning opening bid was 175,000 yuan for sale, and then the transaction was made at 170,000 yuan. The import gang was sucking very hard, and the market price once rose to 185,000 yuan. Later, due to the tight money supply, the delivery was sparse, and there were many sales, and the market showed a straight decline, and the lowest fell to 155,000 yuan. At about 11 o'clock, buyers took delivery at low prices, and the market was slightly better, rising back to 170,000 yuan, and closed at the original opening price, an increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous market. The Central Bank did not sell, and the Bank of China sold more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Shorts Covering Positions, Gold Price Improves in the Afternoon <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the gold market was still stagnant, and the price remained unchanged at the limit of 10.45 million. In the off-market spot trading, the Central Bank did not sell gold in the morning. However, due to the tight money supply and the lack of confidence, the opening price was 13.7 million and 14.2 million, slightly higher to 14.1 million and 14.4 million. Midway, because various parties came out frequently, there was more supply than demand, and it fell all the way to 12.6 million and 12.9 million. The noon closing price was 13.3 million and 13.6 million. In the afternoon, due to the loosening of funds and the rise in Hong Kong gold prices, confidence improved. The opening price of the next-day transaction was 17.8 million and 18.3 million, and shorts covered their positions one after another, rising all the way to 18.6 million and 18.9 million. The Central Bank entrusted Dade Cheng Zhaofengchang to lower the price to 18 million, and violently released 320 large bars, rolling in 57.6 billion funds, and the upward trend turned flat. It once fell to 17.7 million and 18.8 million, and the closing price was 17.9 million and 18.2 million. Excluding interest of 300 yuan, it fell back by 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In the off-market futures trading, the morning opening price was 15.3 million and 15.8 million, the highest was 16 million and 16.3 million, the lowest was 15.1 million and 15.4 million, and the noon closing price was 15.2 million and 15.5 million. The afternoon was calm, the opening price of the day's transaction was 15.7 million and 16 million, the highest was 16 million and 16.3 million. Midway, due to the Central Bank's gold selling, it fell all the way to 15 million and 15.2 million at the closing, an increase of 2 million yuan compared to the previous day. The overnight interest rate for longs and shorts opened high at 50 yuan, at 310 yuan and 330 yuan. The differential margin was settled at 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the gold jewelry price in silver stores fluctuated several times. In the morning, it fell all the way to 13.5 million and 14 million. At noon, it rose to 13 million and 14.5 million. In the afternoon, it rose again to 14 million and 16 million, an increase of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of silver jewelry was stable at 140,000 and 170,000. The current cash price for money exchange was 12.5 million and 13.5 million in the morning, and rose to 13.5 million and 14.5 million in the afternoon, an increase of 2.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the US dollar market outside the stock exchange was sluggish in the morning due to the sluggish gold price, tight funds, and stable confidence. The opening price was 280,000 and 290,000, the highest was 285,000 and 295,000, the lowest was 260,000 and 270,000, and the noon closing price was 265,000 and 275,000. In the afternoon, the opening price for next-day trading was 360,000 and 370,000, the highest was 365,000 and 375,000, the lowest was 355,000 and 365,000, and the closing price was still 360,000 and 370,000. Excluding interest of 300 yuan, the result was a decrease of 30,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Silver Dollar Supply and Demand Both Strong <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, about 200,000 silver dollars were withdrawn from various places for exchange. The market situation was stable in the road trading of Commercial Press. Large heads were bid at 230,000 and 250,000. In the afternoon, due to the easing of funds, the banks vigorously absorbed them, and the price was raised all the way to 280,000 and 300,000. In the evening, it was slightly lower to 270,000 and 290,000. Small heads were bid at 210,000 and 230,000. Miscellaneous foreign coins were in great demand by the Central Bank, and Eagle Dragon coins were bid up to 160,000 and 180,000. In the bill trading, large heads were traded at 250,000 and 270,000 in the morning. In the afternoon, they were also higher at 280,000 and 300,000. For next-day delivery, large heads were higher at 350,000 and 370,000, and then slightly lower to 320,000 and 340,000. The potential was quite quiet, an increase of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the gold and silver ratio of the cross-market numbers in the Stock Exchange Building improved due to the Central Bank's cessation of exchange. Large heads were bid at 49 and 51, the highest was 50 and 52, and near noon, it fell to 49 and 51. In the afternoon, it fell again to 47 and 49. The result was not much different from the previous day. However, small heads increased by 4 yuan, to 62 and 65. Eagle Dragon coins resumed trading, at 72 and 77. The trading was quite active.</p>

<p>— Spectator</p>
<p>Factory Prices Lead General Market Prices - Salary System Should Be Improved</p>
<p>The overall situation is ominous, and it has been blatantly reflected in the market.</p>
<p>Yesterday's morning and afternoon were like two different worlds. In the afternoon, the strength of the strength exceeded the strength of the rush.</p>
<p>Gold is now one code, and silver dollars have only increased in interest. Citibank is still relatively inferior. The most dangerous thing is the Five Oceans market. Cigarettes, soap, and matches were originally behind the factory prices, and the mobile cigarette counters were all raising prices at the snuff boss. Yesterday, the market prices caught up with the factory prices. If the market price is a rabbit, then the factory price must be like a tortoise competing with the rabbit, and will continue to work hard.</p>
<p>Market prices reflect sales</p>
<p>Factory prices reflect the boss's heart.</p>
<p>The boss must earn enough to win or lose every time he pays wages.</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, please check the factory price columns in the newspapers on the 3rd and 17th of each month, and compare them with the market price columns on that day, and you will see it clearly.</p>
<p>Factory prices can actually be greater than market prices, which is only possible in Chinese society.</p>
<p>Changing the wage salary to silver dollars has been agreed by the authorities.</p>
<p>The index is published once a week, which is necessary.</p>
<p>If wages and salaries are also paid once a week; it is really more disadvantageous to the employee class than paying once every half a month.</p>
<p>Because the more times salaries are paid, the greater the degree of fragmentation. The wages received are not even enough to buy a load of coal balls. Isn't this kind of wage increasing the suffering of employees? However, paying wages every week will create this situation.</p>
<p>However, in the current situation, the method of paying wages every half a month is really not feasible. Because the employees suffer too much. The phenomena in the salary payments in the past few periods are iron proof. To solve the salary payment method fairly, there are really only two methods:</p>
<p>(1) Change to paying silver dollars uniformly according to the pre-war standard.</p>
<p>(2) Prepay one month's salary according to the index of each period, and make up the difference when due.</p>
<p>Changing to paying silver dollars uniformly according to the pre-war standard is fair and reasonable. The prerequisite is that the Central Bank must bear the responsibility of fully supplying silver dollars, which is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Prepaying for one month is more reasonable. Because in the past, wages were paid according to the index, using the average price index of the past, but the price on the salary payment date was the highest price of the past, and the employees had already suffered a great loss. Moreover, when using the wages, the price is still rising, so when comparing the index at the time of receiving wages with the price at the time of using wages, it is the lowest index, and the employees suffer even more.</p>
<p>In short, the past index-based salary payment method itself has made each employee suffer two obvious losses.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Liu Gongyun has the intention of resigning, but it is actually unnecessary.</p>
<p>"The situation creates heroes". At this time, the economic situation is so chaotic, Feng Liu's familiarity with market skills can do a lot for the country. In the past, Liu made mistakes and was criticized by all parties. Frankly speaking, it was because Liu's policy had no fixed principles. Former Finance Minister Xu Kan had great ability, but he was also troubled by the same mistake.</p>
<p>For example, take an example: Before paying wages, the Central Bank often suppresses the market price of gold - in fact, at this time, manufacturers want to raise the price of goods and cash out inventory to adjust funds. Therefore, which boss does not hate the Central Bank to the extreme.</p>
<p>Controlling the market, without knowing how to use social policies to protect the interests of workers and citizens, and without knowing how to use the principles of capitalism to protect the interests of the bourgeoisie, then he will not gain public opinion, and it is his own fault.</p>
<p>If Liu can grasp these relative principles, with his experience in controlling the market, it is not impossible to achieve something.</p>
<p>Liu, think again!</p>
<p>Finance Minister Liu's policy lacks principles - With his ability, he can do a lot</p>
<h3 id="e110">Tight Money, High Black Market Interest, Sluggish Rice Buying, Oil Market Hovering Down, Miscellaneous Grains Weak and Falling <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The rice market rose slightly yesterday, but due to tight money and high black market interest, there were more sellers than buyers. Although each commodity rose by more than 100,000 yuan compared to yesterday, it was still not enough to offset the interest consumed, so it was a clear rise but a hidden weakness. The price of Beishi white japonica rice was 1.47 million yuan, an increase of 170,000 yuan. The price of early thin rice rose by about 150,000 yuan. The price of Nanshi white japonica rice was 1.45 million yuan, and the price of thin rice was 1.5 million yuan. At this price, it will not be sold out in the future. The price of the spot rice today is 1.6 million yuan for white japonica rice and 1.56 million yuan for early rice. The total amount of goods arriving in the two cities is 4,974 stone.</p>
<p>The edible oil market trend hovered down. Due to tight money, retail investors are all watching and not buying. The owners of the goods are selling their shares, and the sales channels are very dull. The highest price of raw vegetable oil was 7.1 million, and the closing price was 6.7 million. The closing price of soybean oil was 7.8 million yuan, a decrease of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. The price of Ji barrel raw oil was 7.2 million yuan, a decrease of 400,000 yuan. Soybean cake was weak and then firm.</p>
<p>The flour market trend hovered. From the opening to the closing, the price remained hovering at a firm level. The old car opened at 540,000 in the morning, the highest was 556,000, and the closing price returned to 550,000. The sales of bingchuan passengers were extremely high, and it once returned to 530,000. With tight money, the downstream was rebuilt and opened at 520,000. The wheat bran failed to catch up with the flour market's rise in the previous days, and it was raised by another 10% yesterday. The large package opened at 460,000 yuan and climbed to a peak of 475,000 yuan at the close.</p>
<p>The miscellaneous grains market was weak and fell due to tight money. However, the kernels for yellow beans were absorbed by the guest helper, and the market prices all rose. Winter beans were 1.4 million, the highest was 1.6 million. The kernels rose by 10%, the corn was flat and then weak, the red miscellaneous was stable, and the sesame trading became active.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Yarn Market Clearly Firm and Weak in Hidden Ways, Cotton Cloth Market Rebounds Later <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was clearly firm and weak in hidden ways yesterday. The reason is that the market dismantling rate is high. The households holding goods saw the difficulty in dismantling and borrowing, and the intention to sell was very strong. Only the South China side of the guest helper slightly absorbed, and the insiders searched and purchased smoothly. As a result, although the prices of each yarn rose by 10%, they still could not maintain the interest rate.</p>
<p>The initial price of 42-count blue phoenix was 92 million, and finally retreated to 88 million, an increase of 8 million compared to the previous price. The price of 32-count silver moon went from 61 million to 59 million, and ended, with a final increase of 6 million.</p>
<p>The 21-count Double Horse initially opened at 51 million, once looked pretty at 51.5 million in the middle, and was forced back into the pass at noon, at 49.5 million, with a squeeze increase of 6.5 million. The 20-count Double Horse was 46 million, with a slight increase of 2 million. The other Tiannv and Red Kui Xing all buckled into the 5 million mark, and the other yarns also started to increase by more than 10%. The cotton cloth market was sluggish in the previous market, because the money supply was too tight, and those who held the goods were oppressed by high-interest lenders, and they were not willing to defend. Moreover, the sales to customers were not fast, and affected by the current situation, all parties had no intention of absorbing a large amount. In the afternoon, the money supply loosened slightly, and confidence fluctuated. The rising wind rekindled, and all the cloths created new highs again.</p>
<p>The initial opening price of the leading fine parts was 1.54 million in the morning. Then, it was heard that the market dismantling rate was as high as 3 yuan, and retail investors still cut prices to seek sales. The lowest level was 1.43 million. Near noon, many shorts covered their positions, and the price rose again to 1.51 million at noon, a decrease of 110,000 compared to the next-day evening closing price. The market then buckled into the 2 million opening price, which was 1.95 million.</p>
<p>The four gentlemen's serge opened at 1.5 million, and then fell to 1.41 million, and finally closed at 1.46 million, a decrease of 130,000. In the afternoon, it was raised to 1.92 million, and other cloths frequently created unprecedented new highs. The 1.9 million high-end Shilin has exceeded the 4 million mark.</p>

<p>[Report by the News Office] The Da Gong versus McLeans Chinese-Western basketball exhibition game, organized by the city's Sports Reporters Association, was held at the City Gymnasium at 7:15 last night. The Da Gong team, having just returned from an overseas expedition, had been away from Shanghai fans for several months. McLeans, on the other hand, had been playing increasingly hard in the league, showing excellent recent form. Over three thousand spectators, drawn by their reputation, attended last night. Da Gong won with a score of 45 to 35. In the first half, both teams held their ground, with Da Gong leading by six points at 20 to 14.</p>
<p>Before the main game, there were two friendly matches, one for women and one for men. In the women's match, the Elegant team defeated the Strength team, 32 to 24. In the men's match, Da Tong defeated John, 29 to 24. The women's exhibition was relaxed, while the two university powerhouses in the men's match were in a constant state of fierce competition.</p>
<p>Last night, the Da Gong team performed exceptionally well. Cai Wenhua showed clear thinking, Huang Bailing contributed the most points, Cai Zhongqi displayed the vigor of a flying general, Zhan Chen charged like a rabbit, Tu Wenlong showed unparalleled bravery, and Ye Yunshan also put in a considerable effort. However, at times, the team seemed to lack "qi" (energy). It is said that Cai Lianke has decided to leave Da Gong, which explains his absence. McLeans' movements were extremely fast, with Hua Erxu, Laimushan, and Kaixiong putting on particularly outstanding performances.</p>
<p>Da Gong's starting five were Cai Zhongqi, Cai Wenhua, Zhan Chen, Tu Wenlong, and Ye Yunshan. The game started at 7:25. Ye and Tu committed fouls one after the other, and Laimushan and Kaixiong each scored one point, tying the game at 2-2. Wenhua's swiftness, and a successful free throw, allowed Da Gong to breathe a sigh of relief. Zhongqi was thoughtful and meticulous, Zhan Chen waited patiently for opportunities, and the ferocity of old Tu and the willingness of Yunshan to run were still not apparent, which shows how "good" and "intense" the McLeans performance was. A successful two-point free throw by the foreign player Laimushan, followed by two strong throws by Zhan and Cai, made it 7-5. Huang Bailing replaced Zhongqi, and the opponent's strongman Hua Erxu pulled it back to a tie at 7 with a three-pointer. Wenhua pushed in a shot, and Kaixiong created another tie. Yunshan scored, and McLeans made three substitutions in a row, but the result was not as good as before. Da Gong played steadily, accumulating points "little by little." When the score was 15-10, Wenlong had already committed four fouls, and Zhongqi re-entered the game. Wenhua's skillful coordination and a successful free throw by Bailing at the end of the first half made the score 20-14, with McLeans trailing by six points.</p>
<p>Resuming after the break, Zhan Chen easily scored a basket with Wenhua's assistance. Zhongqi's decisiveness and speed, along with Bailing's consecutive scores, helped. McLeans' Hua Erxu, Kaixiong, and Laimushan, the three musketeers, were still unconvinced, but Da Gong's Zhan Chen and Bailing continued to score, maintaining the lead. At 33-27, Tu replaced Wenhua, and McLeans' strongman committed his fifth foul and had to leave the court, further weakening their team. At 36-27, Zhongqi also committed his fifth foul and was replaced by Zhang Gensheng. McLeans' defense was weak, and they seemed on the verge of collapse. Gensheng's passes were perfectly timed, and Bailing scored effortlessly. Zhan was then dismissed with his fifth foul and replaced by Wang Cunzhong. Wang missed a shot and was sent off. Wenhua re-entered the game. In the last minute, both Tu and Ye committed their fifth fouls. Da Gong had no more players to substitute, and had to play five against three. McLeans also had five players foul out. In the end, Da Gong won against McLeans 45-35, by ten points.</p>

<p>In the women's friendly match between Elegant and Strength, the players entered the court amidst cheers. At the starting whistle, Elegant's Wang Zhelun scored first. Miss Wang's steady shooting quickly made it 5-1. Strength's Liang Miaoling displayed her skill, gradually improving the situation to 7-5, just one basket behind. Suddenly, Sun Fengzhu and Qian Mengyue launched a two-pronged attack, and Elegant led 11-5 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Huang Ruyu replaced Zhelun, and Wang Jiahua replaced Jia Wah for the opposing team. The situation was evenly matched. At halftime, Elegant led 17-10.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, Elegant shot quickly and scored more points. The Strength team dribbled through the opposing defense, putting on a spectacular performance. The score in this quarter was 25-15. In the final quarter, Mengyue flipped the ball into the basket, with unexpected skill. The Strength team fought more bravely, with Jiacui, Miaozhen, and Xiayun collaborating skillfully, scoring baskets and free throws, creating a situation where they could potentially win. The Elegant team did not dare to be negligent and eventually won 32-24.</p>

<p>In the men's friendly match between John and Da Tong, the two university powerhouses each displayed their own unique skills. Gathering the essence of strong teams from around Shanghai, this match could be described as "extraordinary" and worthy of attention. After the tip-off, Da Tong's Li Hanting scored first. John's Sun Moses retaliated, and the score was tied repeatedly at 2-2, 4-4, and 6-6. Li Hanting made a free throw to make it 7-6, and Xu Zhongyi scored a basket to make it 9-7. Le Jiazhou, being small in stature, had good ball sense, making it 15-11. John's Hu Huizhao replaced Zhuang Yirong. Soon after, Wang Gongsen replaced Tao Yingshi. Mo made it 14-14, and then tied the game at 16-16. Guozheng made a free throw, allowing them to lead by one point at 17-16 at halftime.</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, John's ball god was not working, and many shots under the basket were missed, much to the disappointment of the audience. Star player Sun Guozheng also showed signs of fatigue, missing two free throws. The score gradually fell behind to 23-20. Jiazhou committed his fifth foul, wearing an embarrassed expression. In the last three minutes, John's Guozheng and Moses showed their strength, twice managing to "pull back" a pair of points, making it very intense. Da Tong eventually won against John 29-24.</p>

<p>— Authored by Wang Xinjing, Edited by Chen Linsheng</p>
<p>Therefore, when we return the same incoming ball, we can get various different results, because of the different angles of the ball and the paddle, and the height of the ball hit also differs.</p>
<p>The trajectory of the ball is parabolic. When we use a paddle at the same angle to hit the ball, the height of the ball hit will vary depending on whether the ball hits the paddle closer to or farther away from the body.</p>
<p>The above explains that the height of the ball is distinguished by the angle between the ball and the paddle when it hits. If we want to take the ball as the subject, we can also know that the reason for the height of the ball is distinguished by—the point where the ball receives force—. If we use the paddle to hit the nearest point of the incoming ball, then the force received by the ball is uniform in all parts, and the direction of advance is almost the same as the direction of force and straight; hitting the lower part of the ball, then the force received by the bottom of the ball is greater, and it will inevitably tend upwards.</p>
<p>In summary, to control height, one should observe the trend of the incoming ball, one's own standing position, and see what is convenient at the time. And vary the method of control.</p>
<p>Regarding the control of direction</p>
<p>The correctness of the ball hit depends not only on controlling the height, but also on having a good grasp of the direction of the ball hit. This kind of direction control is distinguished by: 1. the direction of the arm swing; 2. the bias of the paddle; 3. the point of force.</p>
<p>Direction of arm swing</p>
<p>With the swing of the arm, "force" will occur. The direction of the arm swing is where the "force" goes. The ball also goes in the straight direction of the "force." If the arm swing moves straight forward, the direction of the ball is also straight; swinging to the side can hit the ball into a diagonal line. Therefore, the direction of the ball is the direction of the arm swing.</p>
<p>Bias of the paddle</p>
<p>Whether the paddle is forward or flat can control the height of the ball; the bias of the paddle can control the direction of the ball. If the paddle is biased to the left when hitting the ball, the direction of the ball will also be to the left. Sometimes the swing of the arm is to the right, but when close to the ball, slightly bias the paddle to the left, and the direction of the ball will definitely change.</p>
<p>Point of Force</p>
<p>The point of force on the surface of the ball has an upper and lower distinction, and the hit ball will be high or low. Even if the point of force on the ball is biased to the left or right, it will affect the direction of the ball. Hitting the left part of the ball, the right half of the ball will receive less force and tend to the right. Hitting the right side of the ball, the result is a tendency to the left. However, using this method to control the direction, because the force on each part of the ball is uneven, and self-rotation occurs, the degree of directional bias is also difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>In summary, this kind of directional control is nothing more than two types: straight lines and diagonal lines.</p>
<p>Diagonal Line Practice Method</p>
<p>If the ball hit by the opponent is a diagonal line, then hitting the front of the ball will return the ball to its original place. If the incoming ball is a straight line, just identify the target and tilt the paddle slightly to the left or right, and the hit ball will also be a diagonal line.</p>
<p>The more this basic action is practiced, the better. At the same time, one should pay attention to the landing point of the ball sent by the opponent, the strength of the ball, and the height of the bounce. What angle should one use to return the ball? How much should the paddle be biased? If the angle of the paddle is too small, it is often easy to die in the net; if the angle is too large, and the force used when hitting is too strong, it is easy to go off the table. If the angle is large and the force is small, the ball's momentum is weak and high, giving the opponent an excellent opportunity to smash. As for the paddle being biased too severely, it will hit the ball to the side.</p>
<p>Some people often only see the opponent's arm movements and seek methods to return the ball. Usually, this method is not considered wrong, but when encountering an experienced opponent with skilled hitting techniques, it is easy to be deceived. For example, if the opponent's arm moves straight forward, one might guess that its path should also be straight. However, the opponent, at the moment of hitting the ball, slightly biases the paddle, which can change the direction of the ball. At this time, one's own posture to prepare to return the ball is completely ineffective and it becomes impossible to cope with the current incoming ball.</p>
<p>Straight Line Practice Method</p>
<p>The back and forth of the ball is very fast, and we should have the ability to make decisive decisions. Because the ball's coming and going is fleeting, hesitating even a little will lead to mistakes.</p>
<p>Straight line practice involves hitting from one's right side to the opposite left side, or from the left side to the opposite right side. The direction of the ball is a straight line. If the opponent's incoming ball is a diagonal line, then returning the ball in a straight line is relatively difficult, especially on the side that does not hold the paddle. However, to achieve victory and defeat the enemy, by taking advantage of the opponent's lack of preparation, it is easy to achieve results.</p>
<p>To return the opponent's diagonally moving ball, the paddle must be slightly tilted. As for how much to tilt, it is difficult to say. First, one must know the angle and landing point of the incoming ball; second, one must understand the strength of the ball and the possible extent of the ball's movement. Only then can one devise a method to cope with it.</p>
<p>These diagonal and straight line methods should be paid close attention to when first learning, because they will be very beneficial in various hitting techniques in the future.</p>

<p>The Minzhu Cup football match between Kyushu and Huarong was held in the southern city yesterday. After 90 minutes of intense play, the score was tied at 1-1. It can be said that they were evenly matched. Huarong kicked off first and was quite aggressive. About ten minutes into the game, Chen Yuwei scored a goal, but it was disallowed because Chen Lianglian was offside. Huarong persisted, and after 30 minutes, Chen Lianglian passed the ball to the right, and Shang Shiqi ran forward and kicked it. The ball went into the goal through the left corner, a very beautiful shot. Kyushu was not discouraged at all and immediately launched an offensive. Before three minutes had passed, Qiang Yuanzhi shot from afar, and the ball bounced into the goal after touching the legs of both Chen Keming and Xu Guoping, tying the score at 1-1. The competition became even more intense in the second half, and both sides put on extremely spectacular performances. Huarong's front line moved quickly, and the cooperation between Kyushu's Luo Shoufu and Jin Lusheng was particularly seamless, drawing continuous cheers from the audience. However, the defense lines of both teams, anchored by Meng Yiliang and Wu Qi, stood their ground, proving very solid, so the forwards could not break through the final barrier. As a result, they still parted on amicable terms with the score tied at 1-1.</p>

<p>The 4th Table Tennis League continues tonight with one First Division match and five Second Division matches. The First Division match, Huamei versus Choubai, will be held at the Chouye Stadium. Huamei, the runner-up of the previous season, possesses veterans such as Xue Xuchu, the All-China Games table tennis runner-up, as well as Li Zongpei and Mu Hanjun. They have a strong lineup and impressive momentum. The team was originally scheduled to play against Quanlu in the opening match, but it was cancelled due to excessive crowding of the audience, which shows their strong drawing power. Tonight will be their first appearance. The above three players have exquisite skills and are sure to win. In this match, they will use new blood Xue Weichu and defensive chopper Wang Jiuqing to test their skills. Choubai, having just lost to Lianxing, will find it difficult to resist the invasion of the powerhouse. If they can arrange their formation well and fight with all their strength, they may be able to seize a chance to break their zero-point record.</p>
<p>Among the five Second Division matches, Yongwu is a strong team in Second Division A, and Hongbai is the student team of St. John's University, who are also quite skilled. The two sides are sure to have an intense battle.</p>
<p>In addition, in Second Division C, Chouhong will face Wuxing. The former has a long history, but unfortunately, they have already been defeated by the Jingwei youngsters. The latter, in addition to Gong Dingxiang, has many new players participating, and has not yet been defeated. Chouhong must be cautious in the face of battle, and then the outcome is unpredictable. The order of tonight's matches and the list of the two First Division teams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Huamei — Choubai (First Division) 7:00 PM, Chouye</p>

<h3 id="e120">Da Gong vs. Pu Team; Huili's Tactics Succeed; Mayor's Cup Basketball Schedule for Tonight <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>There will be three more matches in the 4th Mayor's Cup men's and women's basketball tournament today, held at the City Gymnasium. The first match, originally scheduled for 5:30 PM between the women's teams John and Eagle, was changed because the Eagle team is organized by students from Shanghai University, and today happened to be an exam day. As the Mayor's Cup does not allow rescheduling, it was agreed with the other five teams to adjust the schedule and time accordingly. Ticket prices remain the same: 5,000 upstairs, 10,000 downstairs, and 20,000 for reserved seats. The revised schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Huili — Maoxun (Men's Division) 6:00 PM</p>
<p>John — Eagle (Women's Division) 7:00 PM</p>
<p>Da Gong — Pu Team (Men's Division) 8:00 PM</p>
<p>The first match is between Huili and Maoxun. Huili tied for third place with the Shanghai Police in this year's league. The team originally had a Northern style, but since receiving guidance from Wu Chengzhang and the assistance of Ye Yunshan and Chen Zhengmiao, their appearance has been completely refreshed, and their skills have also improved steadily. Their strength is undoubtedly strong. Maoxun is the second-place team in Division B of the second tier. With capable and brave players such as Sun Jia, Liu Zhaoren, and Zhuo Guanzheng, they are no longer just anyone, but with such a strong opponent tonight, the chances of victory are slim.</p>
<p>The second match is the battle between two women's teams, John and Eagle. Both sides are school teams with similar strength. The former has good players such as Li Miao, Zhu Min, Lin Jingyi, and Zhang Luoluo, while the latter, under the leadership of Wang Shan, also has impressive skills. When they meet, the outcome is unpredictable.</p>
<p>The last match is between Da Gong and the Pu Team. Da Gong's strength is well-known to Shanghai fans. After returning from their overseas expedition, they publicly revealed their skills for the first time yesterday, defeating the foreign team McLeans, and their skills have improved even further. The five players Cai Wenhua, Cai Lianke, Tu Wenlong, Cai Zhongqi, and Huang Bailing are as fierce as tigers. Wang Cunzhong, Zhan Chen, and Zhang Gensheng also have unique performances. The Pu Team is composed of fellow Fujianese, and also has good players such as Lin Qiren, Huang Wencheng, and Ke Bingyan. However, Da Gong should be able to advance smoothly today.</p>
<h3 id="e121">A Tense Basketball Game; Police/Machine vs. Xishang and Postal/Telecommunications; The Difference in Scores Did Not Exceed Five Balls <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>[Wuxi News] The Shanghai top-tier teams Police/Machine and Kang Basketball Team, due to their admiration for the scenic beauty of the local area, especially made a joint expedition to Laixi yesterday. Starting from 3:30 PM on the 15th of this month, two friendly matches were held at the park's court. There was a sea of people, with a total number of spectators exceeding 3,000, an unprecedented event.</p>
<p>In the first match, Police/Machine played against the local Jiangnan University team. After the start of the game, they fought fiercely, with each team taking turns taking the lead. At the end of the first half, the visiting team led by 11-10. In the second half, Police/Machine had ample stamina, and their offensive became even stronger. As a result, the visiting team defeated the Jiangnan University team 25-16. In the second match, the local champions Postal/Telecommunications played against the strong Kang Team. At precisely 4:30 PM, Postal/Telecommunications and the Kang Team entered the court, and the mood inside the court immediately became heated and tense. It was found that for this expedition to Xixi, the Kang Team, in addition to their original players Lu Dazhen, Wang Chang'an, Rong Chengen, Tong Yanxuan, and Xu Shunfu, also invited Liang Yongbiao, Gao Jiaji, and Zhang Tianxiang, all renowned players from Chengyou and Chunmao, to assist them, which was like adding wings to a tiger, greatly increasing their strength. However, in this match, although Postal/Telecommunications was missing key players Gao Baosheng and Jiang Guoping due to official duties, they still had seven tiger generals, Wang Chunyuan, Wu Jinwen, Lu Qingbao, Li Fangying, Dai Yaozhang, Tang Minsheng, and Yu Yao, taking turns to fight, so the lineup was still extremely strong. After the start of the game, the two sides engaged in close combat, which was extremely tense, and the performance was extremely spectacular. At the end of the first half, Postal/Telecommunications led by 16-10, ahead by six points. After changing baskets and fighting again, Postal/Telecommunications not only had a strict defense, but also a sharp offense. The visiting team only had Liang Yongbiao performing individually, but Postal/Telecommunications' cooperation was tacit, and the result of the match was that Postal/Telecommunications defeated the Kang Team 44-32.</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM on the 16th, they clashed again at the park's court. In the first match, Police/Machine fought Postal/Telecommunications. The visiting team used their starting lineup of five tiger generals, Gu Zhenji, Yang Yifan, Huang Kegen, Liu Yuchang, and renowned player Chen Wenzao, from beginning to end. Since Postal/Telecommunications' key players Gao Baosheng and Jiang Guoping were absent, they still faced the enemy with yesterday's lineup. After the start of the game, the defenses of both sides were tight, and the performance was in full swing. The battle situation was extremely tense. At the end of the first half, Postal/Telecommunications led 5-4, ahead by a valuable one point. After changing sides, Police/Machine's Gu Zhenji made a long-range shot, and the visiting team took the lead at 6-5. Postal/Telecommunications' Tang Minsheng tied the score, and then took the lead again. After Li Fangying scored again, Postal/Telecommunications took the lead for the third time. At this time, the game was nearing the end, and the battle situation became even more heated. As a result, the visiting team was fortunate to rely on several free throw opportunities, and narrowly won against Postal/Telecommunications by one point at 10-9. In the second match, a major battle was fought between the local strong team Gengyu and the Kang Team. After the start of the game, the visiting team had impressive momentum and were in full force. Liang Yongbiao, Lu Dazhen, and Wang Chang'an were unusually active. In the first half, the visiting team led 22-9. After changing sides, the Kang Team's iron hooves trampled everywhere, accumulating points, but Gengyu had not practiced for a long time, so their performance was stiff. As a result, the visiting team won their first victory at 40-22.</p>
<p>Starting at 3:30 PM on the 17th, Postal/Telecommunications was originally scheduled to play against Sider. At 4:00 PM, Police/Machine was scheduled to play against Gengyu again. Both matches were excellent, but due to the uncooperative weather, they were announced to be postponed.</p>

<p>The British Navy's London team is scheduled to play a football friendly match against Jingwu's young players at Yiyuan today at 4:30 PM. Tickets are 8,000 yuan for general admission and 14,000 yuan for special admission. The referee is He Chunhui, and the linesmen are Wang Chongye. The other linesman will be appointed by the British Navy.</p>
<p>The London team is the same group of players who played against the Railway team last month. They have high skills, ample strength, and a style of play where the ball and the player arrive together. They led by one goal against the Railway team until the last five minutes, when the Railway team tied the score. Furthermore, in the second half, their central defender Bo Peiqi had to leave the field due to an eye injury, and they only had ten players playing, otherwise they would have been able to maintain their victory. This shows the team's strong strength.</p>
<p>The Jingwu Shuangfeng, under the guidance of Zhu Qigong, have made rapid progress in their skills and have a tacit understanding of cooperation. Today, all their elite players will play, determined to compete with the foreign players. At that time, there will definitely be a spectacular and fierce battle. Jingwu announced that players are expected to arrive at Yiyuan before 4:00 PM. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Jingwu</p>
<p>Gao Zhiwen, Chen Huimin, Huang Lifu, Zheng Deyao, Zhao Baoli, Chen Zhigang, Yu Qi, Chen Lianglian, Fang Lianqiu, Wang Guoguang, Wu Jingren, Zhuang Xinjia, Chen Yifei, Fan Benjun</p>

Qingbai will also invite Gao Baozheng to cooperate, and has already received Baozheng's approval. Xu Wenkui announces to Jiang Guanqing, Xue Peiran, and Zhang Renyi that if there are no exams at school tomorrow, he hopes to see them at the match. The originally scheduled match between Longtou and Sanxing tomorrow has been postponed to Sunday with the agreement of both parties.

<h3 id="e127">A Casual Discussion on Being One Step Late <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Shouwu</p>
<p>The interference of officials leads to political incompetence; the ultimate consequence of political incompetence is the disintegration of the system and a change in history. This is a matter of regret, the same both at home and abroad, in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper from Japan on the 11th, there was a news item titled "One Step Late," which roughly stated: "...During the price control period, a large batch of five-yuan yarn printed in the United States has already arrived. Unfortunately, at the moment of its arrival, the bills have become ineffective due to the inability to supply market circulation, equivalent to waste paper. The authorities will investigate the responsibility..." Such a bizarre thing is truly a tragedy of the end of the century.</p>
<p>The fact of being "one step late" is regrettable, but it has been repeatedly seen in our country. For example, in 1947, when the Yellow River flooded, although hundreds of thousands of people were starving and waiting to be fed, government officials also loudly called for relief. However, while loudly advocating high ideals, they allowed the relief flour of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to ferment in warehouses, to the point of becoming moldy. By the time the "responsibility was investigated" (?), and funds were raised again, more than one hundred thousand descendants of the Yellow Emperor had already gone to Shouyang Mountain because the relief was "one step late," to wander with Bo Yi and Shu Qi.</p>
<p>The story of being "one step late" is not only a recent occurrence, but there are many precedents in history. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Hong Chengchou was the governor-general of Ji and Liao, and his army marched out of Shanhaiguan, but was defeated by the Manchurian cavalry and retreated to Songshan (southwest of Jinzhou), where they were surrounded by the Manchurian army. Hong Chengchou saw that the morale in the city was still strong and there was nothing to worry about except for the empty granaries. He had no choice but to recruit daredevils to break through the siege and appeal to Beijing for help. The Chongzhen Emperor immediately ordered the Ministry of Revenue to quickly transport grain by sea for support. The Ministry of Revenue believed that sea transport required seagoing ships, so they drafted a document, shifting the responsibility for the ships to the Ministry of Works. Upon receiving the document, the Ministry of Works stated that the shipwrights and shipyards were mostly on the islands of Deng and Lai in Shandong, so they followed suit and issued a document to local officials in Shandong, urging them to handle it urgently. This public affair, which was a matter of life and death for the country, like "rescuing soldiers as if rescuing from fire," was delayed by bureaucratic foot-dragging. By the time Hong Chengchou ran out of food and surrendered to the Qing, Li Chuang entered Beijing, the Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide, the Qing troops entered the customs, and Prince Fu declared himself emperor in Nanjing, in this long process, the "snail's pace" of official documents had barely reached the office of the governor of Fujian. The content was: "Order to immediately purchase and build sea-going ships and timber for transporting grain," and so on.</p>
<p>Based on this, the "advanced" examples of being "one step late" are numerous! Some people say that those financial officials who delayed the "market launch" of the five-yuan gold yuan notes, although suspected of "wasting national currency," actually had the merit of "contracting currency" and reducing issuance. Even in terms of administrative efficiency, they seem to be a step ahead of the officials of the late Ming Dynasty. In that case, we can at least comfort ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Celebrity Insurance <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>We often see Hollywood film companies advertising that Marlene Dietrich's legs are insured for millions of dollars, and Diana Durbin's voice is insured for millions of dollars, etc. Although these are publicity stunts, they are also based on facts. Because Hollywood stars are indeed insured when filming. If an insured star suffers a loss to the film company due to illness or accidental injury during the filming period, the insurance company that underwrites the policy is obligated to pay compensation.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the insurance company that underwrites this type of insurance is not an American company, but a British company called "Lloyd's of London," located far across the ocean. The first person to think of insuring stars was the Hollywood production tycoon David O. Selznick. At the time, no American insurance company was willing to do this business, so Lloyd's underwrote it. Later, other producers followed suit, and American insurance companies also competed to underwrite, but Lloyd's, with its long history, still dominated. Although its maximum compensation for each film company is $750,000.</p>
<p>Every year, millions of dollars flow from Hollywood to Lloyd's coffers, which also earns a lot of foreign exchange for the British government. Before each film is shot, the "star insurance" is handed over to Lloyd's through insurance brokers in Los Angeles. Every star listed on the insurance policy must go to a designated doctor for a physical examination within three days before filming begins, so that the insurance company knows their health condition.</p>
<p>In the files of Lloyd's of London, there is a detailed statistical record of the personal history of every major star in Hollywood. To know if a star has tooth decay or swollen blood vessels, or what their blood pressure is, whether they drink or smoke excessively, just check these files and you will know.</p>
<p>"Celebrity insurance" reduces a lot of losses for producers. For example, when David O. Selznick was filming "Since You Went Away," the losses suffered due to the illness or accidents of the lead stars Claudette Colbert, Jennifer Jones, etc., which delayed the filming, were compensated by Lloyd's for $354,000. In the past, when a star could not film due to some reason, all losses were borne by the producer alone, but now there is someone to share the burden.</p>

<p>— ·Xiao Kangshi·</p>
<p>On "August 19th," the day of price controls, a large gold bar was worth 2,000 gold yuan.</p>
<p>Now, a fried dough stick costs 3,000 gold yuan.</p>
<p>How long has it been since the price of a gold bar in the past can no longer buy a single fried dough stick today, which is truly bewildering!</p>
<h3 id="e130">A History of Eating Meat <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Dasan</p>
<p>There are many records about eating in public and private documents. However, this article is about eating meat, not quoting classics and making textual research, but only a brief recollection of the ups and downs in my personal history of eating meat.</p>
<p>My attitude towards eating meat is like that of a wine lover, welcoming both fat and lean. One piece in the mouth, and I feel its endless flavor. I remember when the War of Resistance against Japan first broke out, when I was at the prime of my life, I ran to the interior, also proud to wear a set of grass-green uniforms. The boot camp was in Jingdezhen. The cheap prices there were beyond expectations. Pork was 28 copper coins per catty, and chicken was 30 coins. The government provided six yuan per month for food, and also provided free military rice. The six yuan was used entirely to buy vegetables, and the three-compartment tin lunchbox was always full of pork every day. The weather was hot, and the large pieces of glistening fatty meat were especially greasy; although the cook's cooking skills were not sophisticated, I did not dislike the roughness, and was very lucky. I enjoyed at least half a box of pork.</p>
<p>In Hunan in 1939, the price of meat was also very cheap, pork was one dime per catty, and beef was one yuan for twenty catties. Because I couldn't stand the Hunanese chili rice, I took care of my own meals, which suited my liking even more. Vegetables were not even on the table, and everything was about meat. Sometimes I was too lazy to cook, so I went to restaurants. The most delicious meat in Hunan restaurants was steamed pork with rice flour. This kind of steamed pork with rice flour can be eaten even by people who are afraid of greasy food; it was naturally even more suitable for me. A large bowl was enough to fill me up, and a small bowl required two. When the Hunan waiters asked me in Changsha dialect about wine and rice, I always shook my head, because with rice flour and meat, nothing else was needed. This was the golden age of my history of eating meat, worthy of being called the "Reign of Zhenguan." Unfortunately, after 1940, the currency continued to depreciate, and the salary I earned was not even enough to fill my stomach, let alone eat meat. The history of those six or seven years fell into a dark age, and the misfortune became increasingly severe, to the point where I did not taste meat for an entire half year.</p>
<p>It was not until the Gold Yuan notes were introduced last year, thanks to Chiang Ching-kuo's price controls, that the economy finally stabilized for a while. The salary I received was really useful. My luck in eating meat turned around again. I bought three or five catties, cooked a big pot, and enjoyed it for several days. I was very lucky to eat during those two months, worthy of being called the "Period of Restoration." Unfortunately, the good times did not last long, and misfortune came again; tofu and turnips were nowhere to be found, so where was there meat? Even if there was, I could only sigh at the meat and call out in vain. It was not until the New Year that I bought three catties of meat, and eating it was full of sadness, far from the taste of those years. It was like quenching thirst with plums when passing by a butcher shop and feasting. Sometimes I went to a restaurant and ordered two pieces of salted meat with tofu, and I already felt covered in sweat. Looking back on the past, it was like an old palace maid recounting the affairs of the Tianbao era. Unexpectedly, the small matter of eating meat is also a portrayal of the world in the past ten years.</p>
<h3 id="e131">A Record of Paying House Tax <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>On the morning of April 15th, at half past eight, the old woman who takes care of the alley and sweeps the garbage brought a house tax payment notice for multiple quarters.</p>
<p>I put down the newspaper and looked at the amount, which was clearly written: three yuan and six jiao. At that time, I really didn't understand whether the three yuan and six jiao referred to gold yuan notes, Yuan silver dollars, or the cost of living index?</p>
<p>At this time, many people had gathered in the alley, discussing what the three yuan and six jiao actually meant.</p>
<p>Sister Zhang said: "This three yuan and six jiao is probably silver dollars, right? Otherwise, three yuan and six jiao in gold yuan notes wouldn't even cover the printing costs! Plus the paper costs, labor, wouldn't the government be suffering a big loss? And the government is quite shrewd these days, with this donation one moment and that donation the next, would it really be such a fool as to lose money on this honest and straightforward house tax?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang said: "I think it's the cost of living index of three yuan and six jiao, right? Three yuan and six jiao in silver dollars would be more than 400,000!"</p>
<p>"That's right! It must be the index, it must be the index. Calculating according to silver dollars would be too harsh" – everyone said.</p>
<p>"Then, we should pay according to the index! When they announce it at eleven o'clock, it will be at least tens of thousands of times higher, which is far different from the last time's 3,402 times!" Mr. Li said, barging in.</p>
<p>"Hmm—" Everyone hummed, Sister Zhang looked at Mrs. Wang, and Mrs. Wang looked at Mr. Li.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang's gaze shot east and swept west, stopping abruptly on my face.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang, why don't you go first! You are young, move fast, and are good with your words. If it really is calculated according to the index, then come back and let us pay sooner."</p>
<p>I could not refuse out of courtesy, so I had to lead the charge and take a trip. And Xiao Mazi from across the street also volunteered to accompany me.</p>
<p>On the way, Xiao Mazi and I seemed to be racing, running wildly.</p>
<p>Soon, the Seventh Office of the Shanghai Municipal Bank was reached.</p>
<p>I handed over the payment notice, and the clerk looked at it: "Three yuan and six jiao."</p>
<p>"Sir, is it gold yuan? Silver dollars? The index?"</p>
<p>"Gold yuan."</p>
<p>"Is it—"</p>
<p>"It's gold yuan, do you hear?"</p>
<p>"Oh! It's three yuan and six jiao in gold yuan!" I said, taking out a five-yuan bill, the bill that had once been rejected by beggars, but unexpectedly came in handy today.</p>
<p>He stamped the payment notice, and handed the receipt and the bill to me, and said:</p>
<p>"What's the use of three yuan and six jiao, I don't want it!"</p>
<p>Xiao Mazi was quite straightforward, took the receipt, didn't even pretend to pay the bill, and left with me.</p>
<p>When we got home, I told the neighbors that the three yuan and six jiao was not Yuan silver dollars, nor the cost of living index, but gold yuan notes. The neighbors all said in unison:</p>
<p>"Really? Is the government really willing to be such a fool? Rare, rare!"</p>
<h3 id="e132">Poetry in Dishes <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Deqi</p>
<p>At the end of last month, this column published an article titled "A Poetic Menu." Everyday dishes, once commented on, add a lot of interest to the meal. I vaguely remember a story in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, volume four, which says:</p>
<p>"Someone wanted to keep a guest for a drink, but had wine and no dishes. He searched his pockets and only found eight copper coins, which was very embarrassing. His wife knew this and said it was easy to handle. She used six coins to buy two eggs, one coin to buy chives, and one coin to buy tofu residue. The first dish was chives noodles topped with two egg yolks. The wife presented it and said: Although it is not a dish, it has meaning, and is named "Two Yellow Orioles Singing in the Green Willows." The second dish was chives noodles with a circle of egg whites. The wife said: It is named "A Row of White Egrets Ascends to the Blue Sky." The third dish was stir-fried tofu residue. The wife said: It is named: "The Window Contains the Snow of a Thousand Autumns on the Western Mountains." The fourth dish was a bowl of clear soup, with two eggshells floating on the surface of the soup. The wife said: It is named "The Gate Moores Ships from Ten Thousand Miles of Eastern Wu." I love this poem and barely pieced it together, please don't laugh at me. The guest praised it greatly."</p>
<p>The above uses three dishes and one soup to allude to a poem by Du Fu. The ancients said "there is wine in poetry," this is "poetry in dishes," which is hilarious. Today's public servants, when guests come and they are short on money, the clever housewife can imitate it.</p>
<h3 id="e133">More Strange Laws <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Sang</p>
<p>Each state in the United States has its own independent laws. Because of the different customs in each place, the laws made in each place also vary. Among them, there are many very strange laws, the reasons and motives for their enactment are unknown.</p>
<p>For example, in Barry, Vermont, the law requires that you must take a bath once every Saturday night. In Winona, Minnesota, men must grow beards.</p>
<p>Illinois prohibits feeding knife blades to pigs, and prohibits speaking English to pigs. In Winnetka, theater managers have the right to expel customers with smelly feet.</p>
<p>In California, it is not allowed to use airplanes or cars to capture animals, except for whaling. In Ohio, donkeys are not allowed to travel more than six miles per hour.</p>
<p>What is particularly bizarre is that in New York, fathers are prohibited from changing diapers for their children. In Boston, it is forbidden to have a dog at home that is ten inches tall. In Charleston, prisoners must pay a fare to ride in the prison van.</p>
<p>Other strange laws, such as not allowing the use of mouth spray when washing or ironing clothes in San Francisco, and prohibiting the raising of beautiful mustaches in Indiana, are all inexplicable.</p>
