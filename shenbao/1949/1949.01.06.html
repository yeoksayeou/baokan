<h3>聨合國秘書長賴伊宣布　研究我國當前局勢　並考慮斡旋和談可能性</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約成功湖五日廣播：聯合國秘書長賴依在記者招待會中稱：渠將「考慮」有何方法可以干預中國戰事。渠將硏究聯合國是否可能設法使中國國共雙方和平解決。賴氏謂，渠將考慮由聯合國出面斡旋以促成中國和平之可能性。賴氏並表示，渠相信一九四九年和平將降臨巴勒斯坦，並謂，聖地爭端之一般解決，將較以前任何時期為接近。但賴氏對於猶太人及埃及人重啓戰釁事，拒不發表意見。關於中國問題，賴氏鄭重稱：渠必先「研究」中國戰事之全面景象，此項戰爭至今尙未被認為國際問題，故不在聯合國權力範圍以內。賴氏稱：「余不知如何能止中國之戰事」，特別强調「余」字，並稱：「或許余將考慮此一問題。」記者詢渠對於聯合國出面斡旋使國共趨於和解一點是否辦得到，渠答稱：「待下次會議時，余將答復此一問題」。賴氏之若干副官謂，賴氏對於中國問題尙未作嚴正之考慮，其中一人認為，賴氏可能得到聯合國不應干涉中國問題之結論。據指出中國之戰事苟有中國以外之某國暗中指使或援助，則將總統之政府必已將問題提請聯合國處理。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京五日電〕此間蘇聯大使館發言人，五日否認中國報紙所稱蘇聯駐華大使羅申將在短期內返莫斯科，與政府商談之說。渠並否認此等揣測羅申之返蘇與目前中國之和平運動有關的消息。</p>
<p>中共避作正面答覆　電臺廣播拒絕和談</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約五日廣播：南京訊，中共電台已率直拒絕蔣總統於去年除夕提出之和平建議，並誇言共黨已接近最後之勝利。該電台解釋其所謂最後勝利之意義為：「澈底毀滅國民黨反動份子及將美帝國主義侵略之軍隊逐出中國」。對蔣總統所稱中國政府仍擁有較共黨為優越之實力一點，該電台頗加譏諷。以前共黨廣播雖曾拒絕政府之和平暗示，但此次廣播為共黨首次直接提及蔣總統之文吿，共黨雖已使政府召開和議之希望為之黯淡，但此尙不能認為共黨之正式答覆。孫科內閣中之主和人士，仍盼望能因繼續努力而獲到停戰，並成立一國共兩黨皆參加之聯合政府。蔣總統之下一行動為何，目前尙無跡象可尋。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山五日廣播：中共對於蔣總統之元旦文吿，至五日止，尙未作正面性之答覆，惟在廣播中，自一月二日起，每日均將新華社元旦社論，連續重複廣播，四日，五日新聞廣播中，則以新華社記者評論方式，對蔣總統文吿施以猛烈抨擊，指責政府之願意談和，乃美國及國民黨之陰謀計劃，企圖保存美國在華特權及官僚的旣得權益，待獲得休息機會以後，行將捲土重來。又謂：北平，上海等地人民對總統文吿甚表冷淡。</p>
<h3>孫科在政務會中　曾報告和戰問題　張治中婦唱夫隨力子對獲致和平將有貢獻</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕行政院長孫科，五日晨主持政務會議時，曾就和戰問題提出報吿，並對總統元旦文吿之由來予以解釋，聞此項報吿對新內閣施政方針之擬具，有參酌應用之意。此外，兼外長吳鐵城及國防部長徐永昌均分別對外交，軍事有所報吿。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕五日為總統元且文吿發表後之第五日，首都政治空氣依然平靜，天氣晴寒，市廛如舊，朝野人士仍以極關切之心情，期待中共對政府和平願望之共嗚。對於中共之於和平問題遲遲不作正面表示一點少數人似顯不耐，亦有一部人士認係好現象，然絕大多數均保持沉默之觀望態皮，並認為共黨非正式之批評，如新華社短評及其記者對蔣總統文吿之評論，均尙不能斷定卽為共黨之正式態度。某權威人士五日晨語記者，和平之門仍然洞開，有信心·抱希望·並愛人民者，終必成功，而和平之獲得，尤賴所有熱心國事者之忠誠。該人士指出合衆社記者季昂自北平拍發電訊「和平在前綫的反映」一文報道之事實極關重要，蓋舉國人民盼望和平，以求溫飽，卽前綫士兵亦對戰爭厭膩，而作戰理想想之考慮已屬其次。今日和平之需求，誠乃不可拒絕者，渠個人推測中共不致過拂民意，至其所以遲遲無正面表示之原因，可能係中共中央政治局內部對若趕具體事項猶未獲得決議，致須延擱時日。渠聲明非樂觀主義者，但目前之情勢尙無悲觀之理由，渠强調政府確有為人民爭得和平之決心，故可作為者良多。渠暗示張治中·邵力子及蔣經國諸氏均將對和平之獲得有甚大之貢獻。記者詢以政府是否曾考慮遺張·邵等赴共區洽和，據答，渠本人不知政府是否曾考慮及此，然張·邵等如為國為民謀，必有勇氣準備接受類此之使命。至於國際調處之可能性，渠稱中國之唯一盟國所能為力者，當較他國為多，政府將不致忽視此一友邦之協助。</p>

<h3>張瀾對外記者談話　認和平希望渺茫　盼中工作勿服從共產情報局政策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社中國分社主任高爾雅本市訊〕前民主同盟主席張瀾，五日單獨會見記者，預測中共不致接受政府之和平建議。此外，中共亦自以為軍事·政治方面均已佔盡上風。此七十七歲之民盟主席稱：「共產黨可能完全不理睬政府的建議，他們也會說不，但是他們決不會說是，每一個人都希望和平，但是我以為希望很渺茫。蔣介石提出的條件中，有兩條特別不能接受，不要說共產黨如此，一般人民也是這樣。這兩條關於政府的接替和國民保持原狀之要求。至於目前政府攻勢中張氏之地位如何？渠否認一切渠已北上參加新政協之謠言。</p>
<p>然張氏證實在香港活動的民盟份子數人已離港北上，與中共舉行新政協，渠透露其中兩人為沈鈞儒及章伯鈞。張瀾稱：無意在今後任何政府中做官，渠稱，聞憶北上之李濟琛參加組織聯合政府的可能性很大。</p>
<p>詢以中共領袖係道地之中國共產黨抑係共產情報局之徒黨，張氏答稱，渠以為彼等屬於前者，然渠又間接表示，若中共圖將中國捲入漩渦，為舉世共產主義而作戰，則渠所代表之思想及紕織將加以反對。張氏稱：「我沒有到過共產區，只好表示些從毛澤東的「新民主主義」這本書上看到的心得。這本書似乎是根據孫中山先生的主張，如果毛澤東照這本書做，他是中國的民族主義者，而不是國際共產黨」。關於毛氏批評南斯拉夫狄托元帥一舉，張氏稱，此乃共產情報局路綫，然又稱：「我在報上看到文吿，但我還不明瞭他的動機，我還不知道這是不是對共產情報局的一種表示罷了，不過我希望毛澤東抱定「新民主主義」裏的理想，而不要服從共產情報局的政策。」渠意厥謂若中共舍一國共產主義而為全球共黛之一部份，則中共欲獲人民之擁護，戞戞乎難矣。詢以若將吿記者之一切在本市發表，對渠是否不利，張氏答稱：若解釋正確，則並無問題，詢以民盟取締後，其行動是否受限制，張氏微笑稱：「我始終想到別地方去。」</p>
<h3>法使館一秘書　與京市民衝突</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京五日電〕此間法大使館今日在秘書里伯柯斯基與街頭市民發生衝突後，已要求中國外交部切實保護各國駐華外交官，緣有司機一人駕車停于里氏汽車間門首，斥其僕役為外國走狗，以致引起糾紛，里氏一度受窘，但未負傷，京滬警備總司令湯恩伯之司機適在毘隣，擬加臂助，亦遭毆擊，卒由大使館通知警察趕到，將滋事人犯悉予逮捕，以待訊究。據法大使館發言人稱，如無相當保證，將向中國外交部正式提出抗議。</p>
<h3>青島美軍撤退說　羅維特稱無所知</h3>
<p>留滬美海軍目前不撤退</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕國務副鄉羅維特今日會見杜魯門總統，事後向記者稱：並未提及靑島美海軍陸戰隊撤退問題，關於撤退之說，本人毫無所知。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓四日電〕總統府秘書羅斯今日在記者招待會中聲稱：中國傳來消息，謂美國駐華之海軍陸戰隊行將撤退云云，白宮不能說明此種傳說因何而起，總統於美國駐華海軍陸戰隊之情形，並無所知。</p>
<p>〔太市訊〕美國駐滬總領事館方面宣稱：中國政府雖已決定淮行和談，然在未接獲中國政府與共產黨雙方有關確實和談情報，及西太平洋海軍司令白吉爾上將之命令之前，上海方面所駐美海軍陸戰隊，決不撤退。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島四日電〕外籍觀察人士四日對記渚談稱：「相信在華美軍卽將採取全面撤退步驟，俾有利於斡旋中國現局」。美國西太平洋艦隊司令部新聞聯絡官艾西頓少校對記者談稱：「卽使靑島美海軍陸戰隊撤至艦上，但海軍艦隊決不致離開靑島海面」。白吉爾中將對此未作正面之表示。海軍陸戰隊營房，已由陸戰隊函請山東大學接收，其海港勤務部，定在十五日撤銷。至於共黨方面所宣傳謂國軍亦將撤退，並將靑島破壞之說，完全無稽，靑市人心，並無顯著反響。美鈔則已跌落，劉安祺司令官對於美軍撤退事，向記者稱：「美軍撤退與否，可不必予以重視」；又謂渠本人對此項消息，尙無所聞</p>
<h3>太原保衞戰　邁入新階段</h3>
<p>〔中央社太原五日電〕太原保衛戰已邁上新階段。據軍方負責人語記者：共匪在其軍事政治攻勢迭遭敗北後，邇來對我長期圍攻，陰謀亦被粉碎，匪所採用之地堡，對壕溝武力圍攻戰術，在初期顯有進展，嗣經我軍採取有效對策，一閱月來斬獲頗多，匪之重武器及第一綫士兵，刻已被迫紛紛後撤，而成批携械向我投誠者日有數起，此固由於我軍民英勇搜剿出擊，及我陣前喊話之感召，實亦為匪傷亡慘重士氣沮喪之明證，此種現象，在東南兩綫尤為顯著，我軍已形成極堅强而隨時可以出擊之陣綫，匪之潰亡已日趨接近矣。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>展望美國八一屆國會</h3>
<p>被杜魯門總統為美國歷史上第二個最壞的國會之第八十屆國會，於去年十二月卅一日成為歷史的陳跡後，在民主黨控制下的第八十一屆新國會即於三日開幕。此對於美國今後的國家大計，不免將有新的決策。當此世局動盪美國躊躇莫決之際，美國第八十一屆新國會的開幕，不論對於美國本身或對於整個世界而言，均有深刻的意義。誠如路透社記者哈特卡塞爾氏所說：「美國第八十一屆新國會於一月三日開幕，實為美國歷史上的一大事伴，足以影響全世界二十億男女人民的生活方式，中國自亦包括在內。」</p>
<p>在故總統羅斯福實行新政期間，美國參衆兩院一直在民主黨的控制之下，達十多年之久，為美國政治史上鮮有的現象；但至第二次大戰勝利結束之後，美國參衆兩院舉行局部改選，因一般選民對於民主黨長期執政發生厭倦，而對於共和黨寄以殷望，結果共和黨乃在參衆兩院佔了多數，衆議員以二四三席對一八五席，參議員以五一席對四五席，壓倒了民主黨。使第八十屆國會完全在共和黨的控制之下，對於民主黨的杜魯門政府，無往而不予以牽制。在外交方面雖有「兩黨一致」政策的形成，但在內政方面幾無一不與羅斯福的新政背道而馳。因此，第八十屆國會乃為美國人民所共棄，去年十一月改選，不僅杜魯門總統擊了他的勁敵杜威而獲得蟬聯，而且民主黨在參衆兩院的議席也壓倒共和黨而佔多數，成為美國政治史上的奇蹟·現在第八十一屆新國會之中，民主黨的衆議員是二六二位，超過共和黨的議席一七一位甚多；民主黨的參議員是五四位，較之共和黨四二席，佔着的優勢也是絕無問題的，</p>
<p>美國民主黨的勝利，不綸對美國或對世界，都有異乎尋常的意義，所以全世界的人民對於新國會的開慕，無不寄以迫切的期望，以為美國對於內政外交的大計，勢將採取新的決策，以挽回世界潮流的逆轉，重新走上和平的大道。故第八十一屆新國會所面臨的問題，多而且難。我們綜合起來，在外交方面，有下列四項問題··（一）北大西洋公約的批准問題；（二）援歐援華的繼續問題。（三）馬歇爾計劃所需美元的增减問題：（四）互惠商約法的延續問題。在內政方面也有下列四大難題：（一）國家預算的編製問題；（二）退阻通貨膨脹的問題；（三）社會安全問題；（四）公民權利的維護問題。</p>
<p>以上這些問題的解決，都為目前一刻不容緩」之事，而就世界眼光看來，美國目前當務之亟，無過於根本大計的抉擇。好在美國新國會參衆兩院民主黨的兩領袖康納利與雷朋，均主張兩黨外交政策應予維持，以為世局動盪，他們需要一種美國外交政策而不是民主黨或共和黨的外交政策，故根本大計或亦不致有大的變更。在過去的一二年之內，美國對內對外的一舉一動，莫不以「杜魯門主義」「馬歇爾計劃」為依歸，而不綸「杜魯門主義或「馬歇爾計劃」，又莫不以「反共防蘇」為其骨幹。在去年一年中，美蘇兩國從事「泠戰」，可謂達於頂點；尤其是柏林紛爭的愈演愈烈，幾乎使冷戰也要流血發熱，成為眞正的國際戰爭，今日思之，猶有餘悸。但我們深信不疑，今日美國需要和平，決不願世界於此時再見戰禍，則「泠戰」演變而為熱戰之趨勢，是否另有阻遏之金圖？「杜魯門主義」「馬歇爾計劃」今後是否更有完美推行的步驟？此則不能不認為是一個嚴重的問題·富於朝氣的第八十一屆新國會，於此當能審愼考慮，作明智的抉擇。</p>
<p>我們回顧一下一九四八年的國際政治，不難發現美國對於任何國際問題，往往出乎爾反乎爾，前後自相矛盾，例如對於巴勒斯坦的猶阿衝突，荷印的印度尼西亞運動，似乎都缺乏一種「堅定不移」的政策。再如「杜魯門主義」的實施，對於歐亞又有先後之分，偏枯了亞洲，使「杜魯門主義」也减輕了它的意義。而「馬歇爾計劃」沒有顧到亞洲尤為不可理解。所以我們不能不勸吿美國議員，對於美國的根本大計，尙應有補充的決策，一經決定之後，必須以全力實施，不達目的不已。惟有如此，美國始能為世界各國的「老大哥」，也唯有如此，美國始能領導世界走上和平之路！</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕杜魯門總統五日要求新國會增加稅收四十億美元，並授權將物價管制及工資管制列爲經濟制度之一部份，「以造福全體人民」。此等請求係包括於聯邦咨文中，杜魯門總統親自在參衆兩院聯席會議中提出咨文，俾使八十一屆國會開始討論其立法計劃，同時總統將於一月二十日開始其本身的新任期。總統稱，提高之稅收最初應自公司中取得，若干則可能自修訂財產稅及遺贈稅中取得。但渠繼稱，「但對增高中產及高級人士之個人所得稅率，亦將予以考慮」。渠稱，此等人士在八十屆國會在去年不顧其否決而通過的减稅法案下，深受利益。除增稅一項外，聯邦咨文中所舉出的各點，大部係杜魯門對八十屆國會的請求及其競選政綱的復述。渠要求廢止塔虎脫—哈萊法，成立雇主法，恢復舊華格納勞工關係法，但對法制罷工，雇主同盟對工會工人的拒用，以及主要工業如公用事業等之停閉等，則應加修正而予抑制。總統並要求置放最高工資及最高物價以及配給足以影響主要生產或生活費用的短缺商品的獨立權力。</p>
<p>外交重心　謀求和平</p>
<p>杜魯門在演辭中，坦白述及外交政策之主題，渠稱，「吾人外交政策的中心則係和平。我們正支持一保持和平的世界組織，以及一造成繁榮的世界經濟政策，我建議恢復相互貿易協定至最大的效力，同時將其延長三年。我們並應該對移民洞開大門，不加歧視。我們應在現在使一切國家明瞭，我並不希望凍結現狀，我們並無意堅持過去的不公正之處。我們歡迎許多國家爲坍進他們的國民的生沾而達成的建設性的努力，在經濟合作總署中，在我們的善鄰政策中，以及在聯合國中，我們已開始推翻阻止世界人類經濟發展和社會進步的國家界限。我們相信，如果我們堅決地保持國際合作的原則，我們必將在事實上獲得現在正圖削弱及推翻此種計劃的國家的擁護。我們現在正站在這樣一個時代，它可能是對我們和全世界人類的極大的成就，但也可能是對我們及全世界人類的可怖的災難」。總統最後稱，渠尙擬在以後對國會作進一步的說明。</p>
<h3>杜魯門咨文要點　應於今後七年內建新屋百萬幢　希望批准人權法消除種族歧視</h3>
<p>總統聯邦咨文之全文如次：「我愉快地報吿八十一屆國會，聯邦無恙，我們的國家甚至較以前更能迎合美國人民的需要。我們已放棄關於國家繁榮的傳統觀念，我們認爲我們的經濟制度，應建築在民主的基礎之上，因此，財富應爲有益於大衆而製造。在最近的大選中，顯出美國人民贊成這一種社會，同時並希望能繼續加以改進。私有企業制度已達成生產的新高峯，農業生產已增高百分之四十五，工業生產則已增高百分之七十五。此項進展使國內外預測美國資本主義崩潰的預言家，大驚失色，但是因爲我們的缺點擴大，我們依舊有任重道遠之感。</p>
<p>我們正受到過度的高物價的痛苦，我們的生產仍不足以滿足需要。我們的最低工資，在一切不能與獨佔企業匹敵的企業中，仍嫌過低，農夫面臨着捉摸不定的未來。吾人正深感電力的不足，五百萬家庭仍居住在貧民區及防火避難所中，三百萬家庭則與其他家庭合居。在許多地區，我們的學校仍感不足，我們的民主理想也常因偏見及不能容忍而挫敗。我們的繁榮正受通貨膨脹壓力的威脅，政府必須能够採取有效行動，以對抗這許多危機。我因此提出下列建議的立法案：</p>
<p>（一）繼續管制消費者信用的權力，並擴大管制銀行信用的權力；（二）授確政府限制投機及商品交換；（三）繼續輸出管制機構；（四）繼續交通優先分配機構；（五）授權優先分配短缺的主要物資；（六）延長及加强管制房租；（七）授權設置對重要工業生產或生活費用有基本影響的短缺物資的最高價格，以及限制將破壞已設置的最高物價的不合理的工資調整。（八）授權立卽硏究適當的生產機構，以解除此項缺乏，同時，對極端缺乏之原料如鋼鐵等，加以儲藏。同時在必需時，授權政府貸款以擴展生產機構，解除此項缺乏，如私營企業不能滿足吾人的需要時，則授權政府建立此種生產機構。</p>
<p>目前，工人們正受到一項法律的不公平的歧視，此一法律剝奪其權利，限制其建設性的努力，此一法律卽有時稱之爲塔虎特——哈萊法案者應予廢止。萊格納法案應予恢復，但若干改進爲需要者，法制罷工及不公正的資方同盟對工會工人的拒用應予禁止。運用經濟力量以決定由現存契約中引起的問題應予防止，法律規定的最低工資，應至少提高至每小時七角五分。</p>
<p>我們必須保證小企業正常發展的機會自由，因此，我們應加强反托辣斯法。支持農業品價格在吾人的計劃中，是重要的一部份，過去對農產品價格的支持應予採用，以防止繼續跌價，目前農產品的價格，顯然落在一般物價之後。</p>
<p>國會應執行抑低房租，建築公共房屋及淸除貧民區，此點我已再三提出。立法中規定的低房租公共房屋的數量，應在以後七年中增加至一百萬幢。我重提我向八十屆議會提出的人權建議，此等建議應予執行，俾聯邦政府恢復其領導權，担負憲法中明白規定的義務。</p>

<h3>商聨會響應和平　主張開國是會議</h3>

<h3>萬一和平絕望　有兩知路可走　潘議長致閉幕詡時指出　色可能再召開臨時大會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」參議會第一屆第八次大會閉幕儀式，於昨晚八時正開始，行禮如儀後，淸議長致休會詞，繼由吳市長致詞，參議會代表季灝致答詞，閉幕式至九時許始於樂聲中宣吿完成。　潘議長稱：今天是本屆第八次大會休會日子，在此次會期中，適逢歡度陽曆新年，而本會依然能够熱烈討論有關本市之各種提案，實堪欣慰。閱讀近日報端披露之總統文吿，給予人民很大的啓示，使上海數百萬人民有了新的希望。本會業已率先拍發呼籲和平之通電，其他各地參議會及人民團體均已紛紛響應，由此可見今日之下人人都祈求和平來臨，此乃「人同此心，心同此理」。惟依個人觀察所及，認爲和平之獲得，尙非簡易。自總統呼籲和平文吿發佈後，共黨迄未有任何反應，我們固然希望共黨能够顧到人民疾苦，放棄戰爭，使和平早日實現，但萬一共黨不能放棄，而欲堅持到底，則我輩將如何呢？本人認爲只有兩條路可走：一是放下武器，等共黨長驅直入，統治全國，吾輩卽成爲統治下之奴隸牛馬。另一是支持反共政府打到最後，獲取眞正的和平。根據以上所述，能够取得廉價之和平固屬理想，但萬一行不通時，惟有凖備支付最大的代價。澈底做到有錢者出錢，有力者出力，屆時本會很可能再召開臨時大會，積極商討決策，希望到那時候大家能不爭多論少。</p>
<p>提案愈來佤少是進步的現象</p>
<p>再者，本次大會會期忽促，但重要提案均經審查會詳爲審查，全部案件均經大會順序處理完成，甚感愉快。日前曾有人認爲參議會開會期間之提案愈來愈少，並謂參議員多已對議案不感興趣。本人則並不以爲然，反之，却認爲是一種進步的現象。本人所以認爲進步者，乃凡屬本會之提案，不提則已，一提必屬重要，且全力求其實施。又對於開會必須過半數會員之規定，本人對此法定人數問題甚表懷肄，這個規定係中國所獨創，幸中央現已覺察，故立法院開會時，以要有五分之一委員山席卽認爲合法，深信此點將來必可修正改良。因爲民主政治是從實際經騐中體騐出來的，中國目前尙在萌芽時期，但必將漸漸長成，我們可以絕對樂觀。</p>
<p>市長希望人民寄予最大信心</p>
<p>吳市長致詞略謂：議長剛才從和平前途談到參議會的進步，本人非常同意。本人亦認爲和平無望時，參議會有卽將召集臨時會議的可能。際此局勢動盪間，負責中央或地方行政機關人員最爲困難，許多事件都無法處理，諸如房租問題，公用事業價格問題，學費問題等等，都不能解決。因此本人有一感覺，以爲或係前世作華，今世才罰當地方行政官員。在今天這個局面之下，但望人民能够體諒政府困苦，寄予最大之信心。對於參議員諸公更望不時予市府以指敎。</p>
<p>季參議員答詞　強調三案重要</p>
<p>季灝致答詞稱：個人認爲本次大會通過之各種提案中，基本要案有三：（一）普及敎育案，政府應儘量促其完成，因敎育乃建國之本。（二）組織軍民合作站，在戰亂之今天非常重要，對郊區及本市治安關係重大，望政府迅速辦理。（三）調整區保組織，提高自衛力量，人生於世，生存第一，生活第二，只要充分發揮自己力量，一切問題都可解決。又陽曆新年替我們帶來了和平的消息，但是否能够實現，尙須視共黨之有無誠意而定，現在大家都祈待共黨的覺悟，俾和平得以來臨，但我們也希望政府旣已拉開和平之門，就須有很大的容量，以人民的意志及力量爲基礎，這樣才會獲得眞正的和平。</p>

<p>在此次紅盤漲風中，紗布漲勢最烈，據該業人士表示，紗布價格與僑匯有密切關係，故央行之提高外匯移轉說行情，對紗布價格極有刺激。且聞央行將繼續提高外匯移轉證市價，故雖銀根轉緊，人心依然看好。此外存兌黃金平衡費之高至四千五百元，亦直接刺激金價之上漲，因昨日申諸存兌者，於當日繳款後，需於一週後始能取貨，五十美元之僑匯價格爲六千五百元，加上拆息計算，已逾八千元，故費金之暗盤高至八千以上，至爲自然。又昨日午後銀根已轉緊，暗息已提高至日拆五十元，今後有關機關如能大量拋售物資，則銀根將續趨緊，物價走勢可能暫吿穩定。</p>
<h3>紅盤昨日開出　棉紗創新高價　四二支藍鳳高見五萬四千元</h3>
<p>棉紗紅盤一致躍升，各方吸胃殊濃，人心均起振作，塲內買氣濃厚，執戶扳持少售。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳自五一〇〇〇元開出後，中途曾高見五四〇〇〇元，臨收因當局拋售，故人心轉軟，午收回落至五〇〇〇〇元，結果較假前在漲一一〇〇〇元左右。四〇支藍鳳喊俏至四九〇〇〇元，三二支銀月初開四〇〇〇〇元，一度雖砌高至四三〇〇〇元，但收市復退至開盤相近，爲四〇五〇〇元，軋升九〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨始由三六五〇〇元開出，最高曾接近四〇〇〇〇元關，午收較開盤價尚低一〇〇〇元，爲三五五〇〇元，終挺九五〇〇元，棧單終做三三〇〇〇元，套利一天期爲一五〇〇元。二〇支雙馬由三四〇〇〇元鬆落至三二〇〇〇元收市，餘紗各激升二成以上，俱創空前未有之新高峯。</p>
<h3>棉布騰升</h3>
<p>布市休假期內市塲雖未集會，但堪外日有成交，市價逐步騰升，昨日紅盤做開龍頭細布一四八〇元，四君子元嗶　一四四〇元，中途本客兩帮需要供殷，市價因此再向上展，臨收聞國行拋售大批紗布，以吸收游資，故人心虛怯，終以勢難力敵，最後前者退至一四一〇元，較假前仍猛挺四五〇元之鉅，後者以一三〇〇元結束，軋升四〇〇元。四君子元直貢由一四六〇元低至一三七〇元收市，終漲四六〇元，高檔一九〇士林廠盤三〇〇〇元，印花嗶嘰一四五〇元，其他各布均較假前提高三成許，惟脚地尚虛，今日有回跌可能。</p>

<h3>產地價格上漲　食米一致升騰　北市白粳突破八百元關</h3>
<p>米市急劇上升，因產地價格上漲，已高出申價，且上日雜糧食油均漲，致人心堅昂異常，開市卽見狂漲，北市塲白粳已突破八百元大關，高達八百十元，薄稻羊秈均叩八百元大關，各狂漲一百八十元，有三成之多，白元高達八百五十元。南市塲白粳薄稻各開七百八十元，上漲一百三四十元，特粳八百二十元，昨日到貨六千八百七十二石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>騰升未已，人心依然看高，散戶吸胃頗濃，米價上漲，貨主卽扳高價格，中市最俏，收市雖略回小，終軋漲甚多，老車粉開市爲三百八十元，一度至三百九十元，收市爲三百八十五元，軋升四十八元。兵船粉收市三百八十一元，挺升四十六元，紅蜂以三百六十三元收市，建成收市三百五十元，各漲四十餘元。大包麩皮猛漲三十餘元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>先漲後回，結果堅疲均有，惟收盤市　甚疲，黃豆初漲五十元，後去路不佳，回小二十元，軋漲三四十元，苞米初開平定，收市軋低一二十元，紅糧略秀十元，收市無受主，元麥平定，芝蔴出戶稀少，漲一百元，管店白蔴一千二百元，生仁再吿上漲，揚州提莊生仁一千九百元，猛漲一百五十元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>初漲後跌，終見軋漲，惟收盤市勢甚疲，開盤因米價上漲，人心堅昂，豆油開市跳出三千元外，曾高達三千二百元，後因價格過高，納胃呆木，貨主逢高售出，豆油收市退入三千元，爲二千九百五十元，軋漲一百五十元，生菜油以二千八百元收市，漲二百元，生油三千元，小車蔴油收市二千五百二十元。豆餅先漲後平，結果平定。</p>

<h3>茶市潛勢俏利</h3>
<p>茶市晨開，繼承假前之餘威，又因圈外各物冉冉向榮，故執戶心思卽以俏利姿熊出現，喊價步趨挺途，潛勢俏利非凡，所開紅盤，直綫上升，迨後雖在各物回軟中，而茶葉行情，毫不稍受束縛，綜觀此種情形，誠有易升難降之象。交易則因雙方談判多居相持，咸僅寥寥做開。</p>
<h3>桐油軋升</h3>
<p>桐油昨市趨勢步履秀跡，所開紅盤，一鳴驚人，俄傾因有利賣消息，同時更聞各物報跌，故人心稍餒·市氣較形帶軟·而與去歲相比，軋升尚多。</p>

<h3>腸診出口突轉佳　可恢復戰前水準</h3>
<p>據腸衣出口業息：去年十二月份上海腸衣，已達三百餘桶，打破勝利以來之最高紀錄，其原因聞係外匯移轉證實行以後，其售價逐日上揚，此時國內物價尚稱穩定，出口頗受刺激。</p>
<p>另一原因，則屬去年十二月份陽衣來源之主要地區，蚌埠合肥一帶之戰事，均入睡眠狀態，而蕪湖一帶與上海交通亦頗暢通，產區來源仍得不斷供給之故。</p>
<p>據業內人士稱：戰前全國腸衣出口，平均每月約一千桶，上海侮月爲六百桶，以目前腸衣在國內之成本，平均每副爲十八元，國外FOB價每副美金一角八分，以外匯移轉證之市價折算，（約爲廿四金圓）若今後外匯移轉證繼續好轉，一般出口商固將紛紛採購，而過去歇業已久之腸衣廠，亦將相繼復工。若目前之情形不變，本年一月份腸衣出口，可達五百桶，稍假時日，不難恢復戰前之水準。</p>

<h3>新年在南通　新人行新政</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　業永樞</p>
<p>〔本報南通二日訊〕南通的除夕，淅瀝瀝的下着不大不小的雨，總以爲第二天一定是個雨天，可是，三十八年的元且却出人意外：雨止雲疏，太陽開始從雲縫裏窺看大地了。南通人過年的心境也跟這天氣一樣：陽光又在敏感的人心頭漏臉了。</p>
<p>當這陽歷新年伊始，而陰歷跨上臘月的時候，行新歷的已作過檢討過去，策劃未來的打算。行舊歷的，在這時期也籌備作一個總結。</p>
<p>在這「除舊布新」的時候，南通官塲已布上一道新陣容，縣長陳賡堯到任快一年，算是復員以來南通縣長中任職最長的，自稱體弱多病，實際上爲的縣財政拮据，無法打開局面，乃迭電呈辭，省府三十七年度末次會已通過准予辭職，改調江寗縣長黃相忱繼任。不約而同的，縣警察局局長，稅捐稽徵處主任，地方法院院長等也都換了新人。新年，用新人，行新政，一切應該是耳目一新了。</p>
<p>臘月黃土貴三分</p>
<p>「臘月黃土貴三分」，今年也不例外。十二月下句，物價跳動的幅度打破了幣制改革，限價開放以來的漲價紀錄。尤其是廿七，廿八那幾天，一日數市，人心惶惶，幾乎不可終日。其中尤以食米爲最。比起無錫，上海的米價來，要貴到二倍至二倍半。北邊的海安，東邊的海門，都比這裏低得多，這是一個畸形的現象。</p>
<p>組商船隊運食米</p>
<p>南通指揮所經濟處對這件事非常注意，特地在除夕日下午召集了有關機關和糧商，商討疏導糧源和核定糧偎兩個問題。原來南通雖是個接近裏下河產米地區的城市，受着交通不暢和治安不靖的影響，却不能就近辦理，反要向江南無錫一帶去採購。而最近又因江陰一帶若干港口封鎖，已買好的八千石米也無法運通。座談會上，決定由糧業公會負責組織商船隊，分報江陰要塞司令部及南通指揮所備查，裝運已購食米。會上對米似作硬性規定。自元旦起，白粳每石一千元，次粳九百五十元，秈米八百七十元，次秈八百十元。嗣後，糊行以無錫偽標凖，外加上力半升，下力半升—下斛力七合，運費七升，以及匯款去錫的匯水，和合法利潤三升等，合計不足二斗，卽南通米價，不應超過無錫米價二成。</p>
<p>收棉冷淡三原因</p>
<p>棉花是南通的富源。秋後的整個南通市塲，直接間接要靠農民出賣棉花得來的錢把牠活躍起來，可是，去年棉市却異常冷淡。前年年底來通收花的江南廠商，有一二十家之多，可是，去年他們已「裹足不前」了。前年中紡在這裏收了十餘萬擔花，去年國棉南通聯購處還收不到三萬擔·相差懸殊。據分析這裹有三個主要的原因：限價期內，因爲價格太低，棉農不願脫手，所以近乎沒有成交。後來，限價開放後，又因時局不安，人心不定，棉商又不願收進。最近，可以做了，天公又不作美，陰雨綿綿，交通不便，交易也不多。除了聯購處以外，南通大生紗廠也在收，但採用的是以紗易棉的辦法。目前規定，八百三十斤皮棉掉二十支紅魁紗一件。</p>
<p>「交征和」三實例</p>
<p>十二月二十六日的國民日報，曾刊出一篇「代論」，題爲「收拾民心，根治貪　」，列舉了「交征利」的例子：「（一）九區一個不學無術的糧業負責人，（糧會理事長），居然利用機會，強征過往糧船實物十分之一以上。（二）四區一個非中籤壯丁，居然昏天黑地被解進了大衙門，花了若干棉紗的代價才得下「望鄉台」，（三）還有：風聞稅票舞弊案，同流者衆，合污成了幫口，還有什麼說的。」這不過是三個例子，這一切輿論和民意機關已提示過，而聽者仍是藐藐。希望這些南通的污點隨舊年而永逝，新的面目隨新年而俱來。</p>
<p>報業困難苦撐持</p>
<p>再談南通的報業罷。在「限價」，「開放」，〔漲風」等接二連三的打擊下，目前南通的報業己到最艱苦的階段。今年元旦，除了改用紅墨油，換了賀年廣告，循例有幾篇慶祝文章外，旁的沒有異樣，硬要找出點特色的話，通報今年的版式變化，要算是新聞界的一件大事。一家四開報在漲風威脅之下，欠薪已達三月之久，過年也無法發一點錢。報館的經濟條件雖然一樣困　，這裏的報人却不喊一聲苦，大都利用儘有的空餘時間，兼一點旁的差事，來維持個人的生計，對於報紙，却始終艱苦的支撐着。</p>

        <h1>1949.01.06</h1>
<h3>United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie Announces Study of Current Situation in China and Considers Possibility of Mediation for Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Lake Success, New York, 5th Radio: United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie stated in a press conference that he would "consider" what methods could be used to intervene in the Chinese war. He will study whether the United Nations can find a way to peacefully resolve the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. Lie stated that he would consider the possibility of the United Nations mediating to promote peace in China. Lie also expressed his belief that peace would come to Palestine in 1949 and that a general resolution of the Holy Land dispute would be closer than ever before. However, Lie declined to comment on the renewed hostilities between Jews and Egyptians. Regarding the China issue, Lie solemnly stated that he must first "study" the overall picture of the Chinese war, which has not yet been considered an international issue and is therefore not within the purview of the United Nations. Lie said, "I don't know how to stop the war in China," particularly emphasizing the word "I," and added, "Perhaps I will consider this issue." When a reporter asked if it was possible for the United Nations to mediate and bring the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party closer to reconciliation, he replied, "I will answer this question at the next meeting." Some of Lie's deputies said that Lie had not yet given serious consideration to the China issue, and one of them believed that Lie might conclude that the United Nations should not interfere in the China issue. It was pointed out that if the war in China was secretly directed or aided by a country other than China, then the President's government would have already brought the matter to the United Nations for processing.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 5th] A spokesperson for the Soviet Embassy here denied on the 5th the claims in Chinese newspapers that Soviet Ambassador to China, Roshchin, would return to Moscow in the near future to discuss matters with the government. He also denied such speculation that Roshchin's return to the Soviet Union was related to the current peace movement in China.</p>
<p>Chinese Communist Party Avoids Direct Reply, Radio Broadcast Rejects Peace Talks</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 5th Radio: Nanjing News, the Chinese Communist Party radio station has directly rejected the peace proposals made by President Chiang on New Year's Eve last year, and boasts that the Communist Party is approaching final victory. The radio station explained that the meaning of its so-called final victory is: "Completely destroying the Kuomintang reactionary elements and driving the American imperialist invading forces out of China." The radio station ridiculed President Chiang's claim that the Chinese government still has superior strength compared to the Communist Party. Although previous Communist Party broadcasts had rejected the government's peace hints, this broadcast was the first time that the Communist Party directly mentioned President Chiang's message. Although the Communist Party has dimmed the government's hope of convening peace talks, this cannot yet be considered the Communist Party's official reply. The advocates for peace in Sun Ke's cabinet still hope that they can achieve a ceasefire through continued efforts and establish a coalition government in which both the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party participate. There are currently no signs of what President Chiang's next move will be.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 5th Radio: As of the 5th, the Chinese Communist Party had not made a direct reply to President Chiang's New Year's Day message. However, in its broadcasts, it has been continuously repeating the New China News Agency's New Year's Day editorial every day since January 2nd. In the news broadcasts on the 4th and 5th, it used a New China News Agency reporter's commentary to launch a fierce attack on President Chiang's message, accusing the government's willingness to talk about peace as a conspiracy planned by the United States and the Kuomintang, attempting to preserve American privileges and the vested interests of bureaucrats in China, and waiting for an opportunity to rest before staging a comeback. It also stated that the people in Peiping and Shanghai were very indifferent to the President's message.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Reports on the Issue of War and Peace in the Political Affairs Meeting, Zhang Zhizhong's Wife Sings in Harmony, Believing Their Combined Efforts Will Contribute to Achieving Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 5th] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, presided over the Political Affairs Meeting on the morning of the 5th, and reported on the issue of war and peace, and explained the origins of the President's New Year's Day message. It is said that this report is intended to be used as a reference in formulating the new cabinet's administrative policies. In addition, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Tiecheng and Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang also reported on foreign affairs and military affairs, respectively.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 5th] The 5th was the fifth day after the publication of the President's New Year's message. The political atmosphere in the capital remained calm. The weather was sunny and cold, and the markets were as usual. People from all walks of life were still awaiting the Chinese Communist Party's response to the government's desire for peace with extreme concern. Regarding the fact that the Chinese Communist Party was slow to make a direct statement on the peace issue, a few people seemed impatient, while some people thought it was a good sign. However, the vast majority remained silent and observant, and believed that the Communist Party's unofficial criticisms, such as the New China News Agency's short commentary and its reporter's commentary on President Chiang's message, could not be conclusively regarded as the Communist Party's official attitude. An authoritative person told reporters on the morning of the 5th that the door to peace was still wide open, and those who had confidence, hope, and loved the people would eventually succeed, and that the attainment of peace would especially depend on the sincerity of all those who were enthusiastic about national affairs. The person pointed out that the fact reported in the Associated Press reporter Ji Ang's dispatch from Peiping, "Reflections of Peace on the Front Lines," was extremely important, because the people of the whole country hoped for peace in order to have enough food and clothing, and even the soldiers on the front lines were tired of the war, and considerations of combat ideals were secondary. Today, the need for peace is truly undeniable, and he personally speculated that the Chinese Communist Party would not go against the will of the people. The reason why they had not made a direct statement may be that the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had not yet reached a resolution on some concrete matters, which had to be delayed.

<h3>Zhang Lan's Talk with Foreign Reporters Believes Hopes for Peace are Slim, Hopes Chinese Communist Party Does Not Obey the Policies of the Cominform</h3>
<p>[Gao Erya, Chief of the China Branch of the Associated Press, Dispatch from This City] Zhang Lan, former chairman of the Democratic League, met with reporters alone on the 5th and predicted that the Chinese Communist Party would not accept the government's peace proposals. In addition, the Chinese Communist Party also believes that it has gained the upper hand in both military and political aspects. The 77-year-old chairman of the Democratic League said: "The Communist Party may completely ignore the government's proposals. They will also say no, but they will never say yes. Everyone hopes for peace, but I think the hope is very slim. There are two conditions proposed by Chiang Kai-shek that are particularly unacceptable. Not to mention the Communist Party, but the general public feels this way. These two are the requirements for the succession of the government and the maintenance of the status quo of the people." As for Zhang's current position in the government's offensive, he denied all rumors that he had gone north to participate in the new Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>However, Zhang confirmed that several Democratic League members active in Hong Kong had left Hong Kong and gone north to hold a new Political Consultative Conference with the Chinese Communist Party. He revealed that two of them were Shen Junru and Zhang Bojun. Zhang Lan said that he had no intention of holding office in any future government. He said that he had heard that Li Jishen, who went north, had a great possibility of participating in the organization of a coalition government.</p>
<p>When asked whether the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party were authentic Chinese communists or followers of the Cominform, Zhang replied that he thought they belonged to the former. However, he also indirectly stated that if the Chinese Communist Party attempted to drag China into a vortex and fight for world communism, then the ideas and organizations he represented would oppose it. Zhang said: "I have not been to the Communist areas, so I can only express some of the experiences I have seen from Mao Zedong's book "New Democracy." This book seems to be based on Sun Yat-sen's proposition. If Mao Zedong does this book, he is a Chinese nationalist, not an international communist." Regarding Mao's criticism of Yugoslav Marshal Tito, Zhang said that this was the Cominform line, but then said: "I saw the message in the newspaper, but I still don't understand his motives. I don't know if this is an expression to the Cominform. However, I hope that Mao Zedong will adhere to the ideals in "New Democracy" and not obey the policies of the Cominform." He meant that if the Chinese Communist Party abandoned one-country communism and became a part of global communism, then it would be difficult for the Chinese Communist Party to gain the support of the people. When asked if publishing everything he told the reporter in this city would be detrimental to him, Zhang replied: "If it is interpreted correctly, there is no problem." When asked if his actions were restricted after the Democratic League was banned, Zhang smiled and said: "I always think of going to other places."</p>

<h3>Taiyuan Defense Enters New Stage</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th] The Taiyuan Defense War has entered a new stage. According to a military official who told reporters: After suffering repeated defeats in its military and political offensives, the Communist bandits have recently been besieging us for a long time, and their conspiracy has also been shattered. The bunker tactics used by the bandits to attack our trenches initially showed progress, but after our army adopted effective countermeasures, it has gained a lot in the past month. The bandits' heavy weapons and front-line soldiers have now been forced to retreat one after another, and several batches of soldiers surrender to us with their weapons every day. This is certainly due to the heroic search and suppression by our military and civilians, and the inspiration of our army's shouts on the front lines.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Looking Ahead to the 81st U.S. Congress</h3>
<p>The Eightieth Congress, deemed by President Truman as the second worst in American history, became a thing of the past on December 31st of last year. Subsequently, the Democratic-controlled Eighty-First Congress commenced on the 3rd. This will inevitably lead to fresh decisions regarding America's national agenda. Amidst global turmoil and America's hesitant stance, the inauguration of the Eighty-First Congress holds profound significance for both the United States and the world at large. As Reuters correspondent Hart Cussell noted, "The commencement of the Eighty-First U.S. Congress on January 3rd marks a major event in American history, with the capacity to impact the lifestyles of two billion men and women globally, including China."</p>
<p>Throughout President Roosevelt's New Deal era, both houses of the U.S. Congress remained under Democratic control for over a decade, a rare phenomenon in American political history. However, following the conclusion of World War II, partial elections were held for both houses. Due to voter fatigue with prolonged Democratic rule and their expectations for the Republican Party, the Republicans ultimately gained a majority in both houses, securing 243 seats against 185 in the House of Representatives and 51 seats against 45 in the Senate, thus overwhelming the Democrats. This placed the Eightieth Congress entirely under Republican control, leading to constant obstruction of the Democratic Truman administration. Although a "bipartisan" policy was formed in foreign affairs, domestic policy almost entirely opposed Roosevelt's New Deal. Consequently, the Eightieth Congress was widely rejected by the American people. In the elections of last November, not only did President Truman defeat his formidable opponent, Dewey, to secure re-election, but the Democratic Party also surpassed the Republican Party in both houses of Congress, achieving a majority and marking a miracle in American political history. Currently, in the Eighty-First Congress, the Democrats hold 262 seats in the House of Representatives, far exceeding the Republican's 171 seats. With 54 Democratic senators compared to the Republican's 42, their advantage is also undoubtedly secure.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party's victory carries extraordinary significance for both the United States and the world. Consequently, people across the globe eagerly anticipate the opening of the new Congress, expecting that America will adopt new policies regarding its domestic and foreign affairs to reverse the global tide and embark once again on the path of peace. Therefore, the Eighty-First Congress faces numerous and challenging problems. In summary, the following four issues exist in foreign affairs: (1) The ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty; (2) The continuation of aid to Europe and China; (3) The increase or decrease of U.S. dollars required for the Marshall Plan; (4) The extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. The following four major challenges also exist in domestic affairs: (1) The compilation of the national budget; (2) The resistance to inflation; (3) Social Security issues; (4) The safeguarding of civil rights.</p>
<p>The resolution of these issues is urgently needed at this moment. From a global perspective, America's most pressing task lies in the fundamental decision of its overall strategy. Fortunately, both Democratic leaders in the U.S. Congress, Connally and Rayburn, advocate maintaining a bipartisan foreign policy, believing that amidst global turmoil, they require an American foreign policy, not a Democratic or Republican one. Therefore, there may not be significant changes to the fundamental strategy. In the past year or two, America's every move, both domestically and internationally, has relied on the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Marshall Plan," both of which have "anti-communism and defense against the Soviet Union" as their core. In the past year, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union reached its peak. In particular, the escalating Berlin dispute almost caused the Cold War to become heated, transforming into a real international war. Thinking about it today, it still causes lingering fear. However, we firmly believe that today America needs peace and does not want to see the world face another war at this time. Therefore, will there be other means to prevent the trend of the "Cold War" evolving into a hot war? Will there be further perfect implementation steps for the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Marshall Plan" in the future? This must be considered a serious question. The energetic Eighty-First Congress should carefully consider this and make wise choices.</p>
<p>Looking back at international politics in 1948, it is not difficult to find that America's approach to any international issue often contradicted itself. For example, it seemed to lack a "steadfast" policy regarding the Jewish-Arab conflict in Palestine and the Indonesian movement in the Dutch East Indies. Furthermore, the implementation of the "Truman Doctrine" differentiated between Europe and Asia, neglecting Asia and diminishing the significance of the "Truman Doctrine." The failure of the "Marshall Plan" to consider Asia is particularly incomprehensible. Therefore, we must urge American legislators to make supplementary decisions regarding America's fundamental strategy. Once a decision is made, it must be implemented with all efforts until the goal is achieved. Only in this way can America be the "big brother" of all countries in the world, and only in this way can America lead the world on the path to peace!</p>

<h3>Truman Reads Message at Joint Session of Senate and House; Calls for New Taxes and Price Controls; Expand Social Security Plan and Repeal Taft-Hartley Labor Act</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman on the 5th asked the new Congress for $4 billion in increased taxes and authority to make price and wage controls part of the economic system "for the benefit of all the people." These requests were included in the State of the Union message, which President Truman personally presented at a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives, so that the 81st Congress could begin discussing its legislative program. At the same time, the president will begin his new term on January 20th. The president said that the increased tax revenue should initially come from corporations, and some may come from revising property and inheritance taxes. But he continued, "But an increase in the personal income tax rates for middle- and high-income individuals will also be considered." He said that these people benefited greatly from the tax cut bill passed by the 80th Congress last year, despite his veto. In addition to the tax increase, most of the points raised in the State of the Union message were repetitions of Truman's requests to the 80th Congress and his campaign platform. He called for the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, the establishment of an employer law, and the restoration of the old Wagner Labor Relations Act, but with revisions to curb illegal strikes, employer alliances against union workers, and shutdowns of major industries such as public utilities. The president also asked for the independent power to impose maximum wages and maximum prices and to ration scarce commodities that significantly affect major production or living expenses.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Focus on Seeking Peace</p>
<p>In his speech, Truman frankly discussed the theme of foreign policy. He said, "The center of our foreign policy is peace. We are supporting a world organization that maintains peace, and a world economic policy that creates prosperity. I recommend restoring the mutual trade agreement to its maximum effectiveness, and extending it for three years. We should also open our doors to immigrants without discrimination. We should now make it clear to all countries that we do not want to freeze the status quo, and we have no intention of insisting on past injustices. We welcome the constructive efforts made by many countries to improve the lives of their citizens. In the Economic Cooperation Administration, in our Good Neighbor Policy, and in the United Nations, we have begun to overturn the national boundaries that prevent the economic development and social progress of the world's people. We believe that if we firmly maintain the principles of international cooperation, we will in fact gain the support of countries that are now trying to weaken and overturn this plan. We are now standing at an era that may be of great achievement for us and all mankind, but it may also be of terrible disaster for us and all mankind." The president concluded by saying that he still intends to make further explanations to Congress in the future.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Truman's Message; One Million New Homes Should Be Built in the Next Seven Years; Hope to Approve Human Rights Law and Eliminate Racial Discrimination</h3>
<p>The full text of the President's State of the Union message is as follows: "I am pleased to report to the 81st Congress that the Union is in good shape, and our country is even better able to meet the needs of the American people than before. We have abandoned the traditional concept of national prosperity. We believe that our economic system should be built on a democratic foundation, so that wealth should be created for the benefit of the public. In the recent election, it was shown that the American people approve of this kind of society and hope to continue to improve it. The private enterprise system has achieved new peaks of production. Agricultural production has increased by 45%, and industrial production has increased by 75%. This progress has greatly surprised the prophets at home and abroad who predicted the collapse of American capitalism. But because our shortcomings are expanding, we still feel that we have a long way to go.</p>
<p>We are suffering from excessively high prices, and our production is still not enough to meet the needs. Our minimum wage is still too low in all enterprises that cannot compete with monopoly enterprises, and farmers face an uncertain future. We are deeply concerned about the shortage of electricity, five million families still live in slums and fire shelters, and three million families live with other families. In many areas, our schools are still inadequate, and our democratic ideals are often frustrated by prejudice and intolerance. Our prosperity is being threatened by inflationary pressures, and the government must be able to take effective action to counter these many crises. Therefore, I propose the following legislative bills:</p>
<p>(1) Continue the power to regulate consumer credit and expand the power to regulate bank credit; (2) Authorize the government to restrict speculation and commodity exchange; (3) Continue the export control agency; (4) Continue the traffic priority allocation agency; (5) Authorize the priority allocation of scarce major materials; (6) Extend and strengthen rent control; (7) Authorize the establishment of maximum prices for scarce materials that have a fundamental impact on the production or cost of living of important industries, and restrict unreasonable wage adjustments that will undermine the established maximum prices. (8) Authorize immediate research into appropriate production facilities to alleviate this shortage, and at the same time, store extremely scarce raw materials such as steel. At the same time, when necessary, authorize the government to provide loans to expand production facilities and alleviate this shortage. If private enterprises cannot meet our needs, authorize the government to establish such production facilities.</p>
<p>Currently, workers are being unfairly discriminated against by a law that deprives them of their rights and restricts their constructive efforts. This law, sometimes referred to as the Taft-Hartley Act, should be repealed. The Wagner Act should be restored, but with certain improvements as needed. Illegal strikes and unfair employer alliances against union workers should be prohibited. The use of economic power to resolve issues arising from existing contracts should be prevented. The legally stipulated minimum wage should be increased to at least 75 cents per hour.</p>
<p>We must ensure the free opportunity for small businesses to develop normally. Therefore, we should strengthen the anti-trust law. Supporting agricultural product prices is an important part of our plan. The past support for agricultural product prices should be adopted to prevent continued price declines. Currently, the prices of agricultural products are clearly lagging behind general prices.</p>
<p>Congress should implement measures to lower rents, build public housing, and clear slums. I have repeatedly proposed this point. The number of low-rent public houses stipulated in the legislation should be increased to one million in the next seven years. I reiterate the human rights recommendations I made to the 80th Congress. These recommendations should be implemented so that the federal government can restore its leadership and assume the obligations clearly stipulated in the Constitution.</p>

<p>[Another Wire] Pakistani Foreign Minister Zafrullah Khan cabled the Security Council today, demanding that the Dutch troops immediately retreat to the border lines before the invasion of the Republic of Indonesia and release the captured Indonesian President Sukarno and others. It is claimed that the above two matters are necessary steps to uphold the authority of the United Nations and restore its lost dignity. The only basis for a peaceful resolution of the Indonesian issue is for both parties to negotiate on an equal footing, otherwise there will only be a complete break between the Netherlands and Indonesia, and they will forever be enemies. The Indonesian-Dutch conflict is a necessary step to restore peace in Southeast Asia and maintain international peace.</p>

<h3>US Army Secretary's Visit to Europe Appreciated; Believes War Can Be Avoided Temporarily; Advocates Reducing Occupation Fees for Germany, Japan, and Korea</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] Army Secretary Royall disclosed on the 4th that the government will request a total of $1.1 billion in occupation fees for Germany, Japan, and Korea for the next fiscal year from Congress, a decrease of $200 million from this year's figures. At the same time, the State Department announced that the United Kingdom and the United States have reached an agreement to continue the joint economic work in the British and American occupation zones in Germany until the end of March, at which time it is hoped that an agreement can be reached with France to turn the "dual occupation zone" into a "triple occupation zone." Royall's announcement was the first public statement regarding any major part of Truman's new budget proposal. The budget proposal will be submitted to Congress in the middle of next week. Royall said that of the $1.1 billion, the German portion is about $500 million and the Japanese portion is $600 million. The Japanese portion also includes the expenses for the Korean portion, but this only accounts for a small number, as the occupation forces stationed in Korea are currently decreasing. Royall also told reporters: (1) He still maintains his estimate from last autumn that war is not imminent. (2) During his recent trip to Western Europe, he obtained "a very positive impression that democratic forces are growing day by day. The determination to oppose communist infiltration is also becoming stronger." (3) The progress of German industrial recovery is "extremely satisfactory" and production has now increased.</p>
<h3>Dutch Announce Ceasefire in the Gardens of Sumatra; The Area and Most of Java are Occupied by the Dutch</h3>

<h3>Siam Maintains Friendly Relations with the Netherlands; Does Not Attend Asian Conference</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bangkok, 5th] The Siamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Siam will not send a representative to the Asian conference convened in New Delhi to discuss the Indonesian issue.

<h3>Soviet Union Accuses the United States in the Allied Control Council; Expanding Japanese Police Force; The US Lists Facts and Figures to Refute</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] The Soviet Union accused the United States on the 5th in the 77th meeting of the Allied Control Council for Japan that the Japanese police, under the encouragement of the United States, are secretly being expanded into an army, but the United States quickly denied it. Soviet Representative Lieutenant General Derevyanko accused Japan of moving towards the goal of establishing an armed force of 300,000 people with the encouragement of the United States. Derevyanko warned that this move would give Japan a force equivalent to 17 infantry divisions, the same strength that Japan had five years before the Northeast Incident in 1931. He accused MacArthur's headquarters of encouraging this expansion without discussing it with the Allied Control Council and the Far Eastern Commission. Derevyanko said that according to statistics from various sources, Japan already has 141,206 police officers. In addition, Japan also has 10,000 maritime police and 22,000 easily mobilized railway police. He estimated that the current strength is 2.5 times the 56,000 that Japan retained at the time of surrender. He also accused the existence of so-called "secret police" activities, whose obvious goal is to deal with labor unions. US Representative Sebald replied immediately: "I am deeply surprised by the Soviet representative's statement. Obviously, I believe that the current Japanese police can never be built into an army." Sebald said that the number of police officers at the time of Japan's surrender in August 1945 was 130,809. The Soviet statement is completely inaccurate. As for the current total number of Japanese police officers, it is about 125,000, with only 25,000 pistols, which are mutually transferred, and the police who hold pistols are only issued an average of a few bullets. Most police officers only hold batons. Sebald also directly denied the existence of any "secret police activities," and said that the Soviet accusations against the maritime police and railway police were greatly exaggerated. British Commonwealth Representative Shaw supported the US position, believing that the current strength of the Japanese police is "nothing to fear."</p>
<h3>Our Representative Shang Zhen; Maintains Neutral Attitude; Believes the Number of New Police Should Be Limited</h3>
<p>Chinese Representative General Shang Zhen maintained a neutral attitude and proposed "Allied vigilance." He recalled that the Japanese police would be used as a tool for Japan's military aggression plan, and said that the number of new police should be limited to the needs of maintaining public peace and order. If further increases are necessary, they should be strictly limited to this goal. The 80-minute meeting ended in failure after a heated debate because the US representative refused to accept the three points raised by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Asian Conference May Form; Pan-Asian Political Group; British Support for the Netherlands May Be Forced to Change</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] According to Southeast Asian observers, the future New Delhi conference on the 4th may develop into a pan-Asian "Nehruism." They said that Indian Prime Minister Nehru's convening of the conference to consider the Indonesian situation may establish a new regional political group in a world that has already been "blocked" by the East and the West.</p>
<p>One of the Indonesian representatives to the United Nations said that he hopes the New Delhi conference will be conducted within the framework of the United Nations. Its representative in Washington hinted that a Southeast Asian group may be formed in the short term. Nehru's invitation may be extended to the entire Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] One of the Indonesian representatives to the United Nations, Subito, believes that the attitude of the three countries of India, Australia, and New Zealand will make British policy on the Indonesian dispute take the opinions of these three countries as opinions. The United Kingdom's current attitude is to support the Netherlands against Indonesia, but India's threat to withdraw from the British Commonwealth, as well as Australia's and New Zealand's extreme fear of the Indonesian war, have caused British policy to change. Subito also said: Although we have unpleasant actions against the Indonesian Communist Party, the Soviet Union's policy still supports us unchanged. The Soviet Union's ability is consistent with its policy in China. The Soviet Union frankly hopes to destroy the Asian alliance.</p>
<h3>Israel Accepts U.S. Advice; Guarantees Withdrawal of Invading Troops from Egypt; Egypt Cables Security Council, Stating Condition for Ceasefire is Compliance with Order</h3>

At the same time, State Department Press Officer McDermott denied rumors that the U.S. had warned that Israel's actions might lead the U.S. to delay formal recognition of Israel and the inability to obtain a $100 million loan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 4th] The Egyptian government cabled the Security Council, restating its willingness to cease fire immediately, provided that the Jewish army also ceases fire at the same time, and stated that the Egyptian army is now only resisting the Jewish army's attacks in self-defense.</p>

<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The eighth plenary session of the first Shanghai Municipal Council concluded successfully last night. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the council held its fifth meeting at its venue on Tanggu Road. Present were Chairman Pan, Deputy Chairman Xu, and 123 councilors.

After Mayor Wu and Land Administration Bureau Director Zhu Ping repeatedly took the stage to explain, a resolution was finally reached, and the original proposal was passed. However, due to the time consumed, the time for discussing other proposals was repeatedly extended, and the meeting concluded at 8:00 PM. The "Examination Report on the General Budget of Income and Expenditure for the 38th Year of the Republic" and the "Examination Opinions on the Policy Report" were generally passed due to lack of time. If any councilors have opinions, they can submit them in writing to the Council Secretariat within three days. Due to time constraints, all provisional motions were also decided to be referred to the relevant subcommittees for discussion after the close of the plenary session. Among them, the motion "During the 'Jiangya' ship disaster, Captain Shen Dacai failed to provide rescue and is undeniably responsible; requesting the Council to send a letter to the Shanghai Local Procuratorate to promptly detain and investigate the captain" was discussed and resolved: This case is related to judicial matters and should be referred to the Shanghai Local Procuratorate for investigation.

<h3>Gold and Silver Redemption Resumes Yesterday; Balancing Fee is 4,500 per Ounce; Silver Dollar Exchange Rate is 65 Yuan per Coin</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] According to the regulations of the Executive Yuan on improving the redemption measures for gold yuan coupons, the National Bank has started to list balancing fees daily yesterday, taking into account the exchange rate of overseas remittances. Yesterday, in addition to the exchange price of 1,000 yuan and the deposit of 1,000 yuan per ounce of gold, an additional balancing fee of 4,500 yuan was added, totaling 6,500 yuan per ounce. The silver dollar is calculated at a ratio of 1% of the gold exchange price, and each silver dollar is equivalent to 65 yuan in gold yuan coupons. In this city, in addition to the National Bank, the Trust Department of the Bank of China, the Trust Department of the Bank of Communications, the Trust Department of the China Farmers Bank, the Postal Savings Bureau, the Trust Department of the Cooperative Bank, and the Xujiahui Office of the Cooperative Bank, all seven locations have resumed operations. The China Trust Bureau failed to open at the same time due to insufficient preparation, but it is expected to join today. The above seven locations processed applications and identity verification procedures within the specified time in the morning. The Shanghai Gold Control Bureau sent personnel to the accepting banks to monitor the processing. The National Bank issued a total of 396 application forms (originally scheduled for 400, but four were voided due to discrepancies between the photo and number on the applicant's identity card). The Bank of China issued 300 forms, and the Agricultural Postal Savings Bureau issued 100 forms each, and the Cooperative Bank issued 200 forms. All payment procedures for the application forms issued yesterday were completed on the same day, and the contracting bank issued a temporary receipt. The applicant for redemption will take the receipt along with their identity card and seal to the bank that issued the application form on the designated date to collect the gold and silver. In addition, since the resumption of redemption yesterday, whether public educators, employees, or ordinary citizens are handling redemption, they will all be charged a balancing fee in accordance with the improved measures, without exception. It is heard that the public educator personnel redemption handled by the Municipal Bank has been fully completed in advance. The section published in various newspapers yesterday that the Municipal Bank had separately scheduled the dates for various units to collect gold and silver from the 5th to the 12th was found to be inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Express Train Delayed; Narrowly Avoids Major Disaster at Suzhou Station</h3>

<h3>Presidents of National Colleges and Universities in Shanghai Jointly Telegraph Ministry of Education to Resign</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The presidents of various national colleges and universities in this city held a meeting at the Sino-American Hospital yesterday afternoon. The attendees included Wang Zhiche of Jiaotong University, Zhang Yi of Fudan University, Li Shouyong of Jinan University, Xia Jianbai of Tongji University, Zhu Hengbi of Shanghai Medical College, Zhu Guozhang of Shanghai Business College, Dai Cuilun of Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and Zhou Junshi of Wusong Merchant Marine College. During the meeting, the presidents decided to jointly telegraph the Ministry to resign because the treatment of public educators and employees had not been adjusted. Under the current situation of high prices, the lives of professors and employees are difficult, and school funding is strained. Although they have repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Education to appeal, there has been no solution. The telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Education, Nanjing: National colleges and universities in the Shanghai area previously reported that the treatment of faculty and staff was meager, their lives were difficult, the public funding for students was too low to maintain meals, and operating expenses were strained, far from covering actual expenses, and requested your Ministry to provide relief as soon as possible. Many days have passed since then, and no instructions have been received. Now that the new year is beginning, the living allowance for January of the 38th year has not yet been allocated. In recent months, the prices of various public utilities in Shanghai have continued to increase, and other prices have also increased steadily. The monthly operating expenses are not enough to cover any one item of water, electricity, or fuel. The lives of professors, employees, and students are even more on the verge of starvation. We, Zhuo, etc., are in charge of school affairs and see our colleagues working on empty stomachs and students struggling to get enough to eat. We have no plan for relief and feel ashamed. At this time of national difficulty, we, Zhuo, etc., dare not shirk our responsibilities in the face of difficulties, but in this desperate situation, we are truly ashamed to cling to our positions. We dare to continue to telegram to report and respectfully request your approval to resign and promptly appoint other virtuous and capable people to take over. We are anxiously awaiting orders. Presidents of National Jiaotong University, National Fudan University, National Jinan University, National Tongji University, National Shanghai Medical College, National Shanghai Business College, National Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and National Wusong Merchant Marine College, together kowtow, Zi, Wei.</p>

<h3>Municipal Industrial Association and Chamber of Commerce Jointly Telegraph Call for Peace</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Industrial Association and the Chamber of Commerce jointly telegraphed the government and the Communist Party on the 4th, requesting an immediate ceasefire in the current location and the dispatch of representatives to continue negotiations. The original telegram stated: "To President Jiang of Nanjing, Vice President Li, the presidents and vice presidents of the Five Yuans, the members of the Executive Yuan, the members of the Control Yuan, the heads of various ministries, and the members of the Central Standing Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang: To Mr. Mao Zedong and Mr. Lin Zuhan in Yan'an, Mr. Li Renchao and Mr. Liao Chengzhi in Hong Kong, and forwarded to Mr. Zhu De, Mr. Peng Dehuai, Mr. Zhou Enlai, and Mr. Ye Jianying, and all members of the Chinese Communist Party: Since the end of the Second World War, countries that participated in the war have learned from the death and devastation of wartime and have been working on economic recovery and establishing five- or ten-year plans to remedy the losses. Even in Eastern and Western Europe, those in charge of state affairs only have different policies, but their love of peace and cherishing of the national foundation are the same. Only Greece, the earliest civilized country in Europe, suffered the invasion of Germany and Italy. After the war ended, it sought war again, and the patriots were deeply saddened. Our country's eight-year war of resistance, the area trampled by Japanese cavalry, almost exceeded half of the national territory. The intensity of the war was equal to that of Eastern Europe and far exceeded that of Western Europe. Unfortunately, the Political Consultative Conference failed, followed by war, facing each other far away, and followed in the footsteps of Greece. The scale of the destruction is far greater than that of Greece. The facts of the past few years are obvious and need not be elaborated. Our associations deeply understand the clear lessons of war and danger and the changes in modern tactics. The plane is three-dimensional, connected as one, and the rear and front are not distinguished. If we do not seek change, we are afraid that the modern industrial and commercial enterprises that have been carefully managed for decades and have a slight foundation left over from the eight-year war will be completely destroyed. At that time, even if there are unparalleled statesmen, they will be at a loss on the ruins to seek economic construction. Therefore, we have been hesitant day and night, thinking that the current plan for national affairs is better to keep it whole than to break it. We also believe that this kind of realistic problem, all those who are loyal to the country, must have the same heart and the same reason. We are pleased to read the President's New Year's Day address, and we think it is a good opportunity to save the country and survive. Since the consultation on politics, starting like ice and charcoal, and then becoming milk and water, there are many examples recorded in history. Only great benevolence can achieve great courage. This is the capacity of a politician. Using a heart that cannot bear to hurt people to implement a policy that cannot bear to hurt people is a maxim of the sages. We respectfully ask the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to seize the opportunity, turn the tide, and immediately announce a ceasefire in the current location. Each party should send representatives to continue negotiations, uphold the public and loyalty of the national system, and show sincerity to each other. Turn hostility into peace, promote political innovation, and then support industry and commerce, cultivate people's livelihood, and unite the country to bury our heads for ten years and turn misfortune into good fortune. At this moment, we express our dying lament for the industry and commerce, and extend our 400 million hopes for the revival. Shanghai Municipal Industrial Association and Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, together kowtow, Zizhi."</p>
<h3>National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Responds to Peace Call; Advocates Convening National Affairs Conference</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China telegraphed the government and the Communist Party authorities yesterday, advocating the convening of a National Affairs Conference and calling for comprehensive peace. The original telegram is as follows: "To President Jiang of Nanjing, Vice President Li, the presidents and vice presidents of the Five Yuans, and all members of the Executive Yuan, the members of the Legislative Yuan, the members of the Control Yuan, the heads of various ministries: To the provincial, municipal, and county councils and all groups and chambers of commerce in the country: To Mr. Mao Zedong and Mr. Lin Zuhan in Yan'an, and forwarded to Mr. Zhu De, Mr. Peng Dehuai, Mr. Zhou Enlai, Mr. Dong Biwu, Mr. Ye Jianying, and all members of the Chinese Communist Party: Eight years of war of resistance and three years of internal strife have led to disaster and impoverishment of the country and the people. Looking around the world, all countries are working together to rebuild and construct after the war. At the beginning of our victory, we originally hoped to meet the times, clarify the world, appease the refugees, recuperate, and build the foundation of peaceful unification to create an immortal career in history. However, political consultation failed, and brothers fought, giving foreign countries an excuse, leading to a decline in international status and economic revival, which is difficult to wait for. Opportunities are lost in the blink of an eye, and the whole country mourns. In recent times, fires of war have spread everywhere, and death fills the fields. The foundation of the country is in danger, and the people have no food. Domestic parties are all descendants of Yan and Huang. Warfare is not the original intention. Saving the country and saving the people should be the same. Witnessing the miserable situation of corruption, why not repent and work together to do the aftermath. Reading President's New Year's Day address, with the spirit of great justice and selflessness and the determination to correct chaos, we announce to the world and call for peace. This is the demeanor that a great politician should have. Businessmen across the country have suffered the pain of war and have been exhausted. Listening to this good news, we are extremely moved. Since the war was not caused by one side, reconciliation should be sought through agreement. Our President cares about the people's suffering and advocates peace, and sincerely gains the opportunity. Then, seize the opportunity and convene a National Affairs Conference as soon as possible, use the will of all the people to guide politics to the right track, and the key to success or failure still depends on the mutual sincerity of the two sides. The members of this association especially suggest that the two parties' Standing Committees immediately cease fire on the spot and immediately send representatives to negotiate peace. Putting down the butcher knife is the time. If you still believe in force and ignore feelings, then you are enemies of the people. How can you be forgiven by the people of the country? The boat can carry you or capsize you, which should be done with caution. This association is the general hub of national business groups. I deeply understand the critical situation. At this moment, I am willing to learn the meaning of Fufu's words and use collective action to promote comprehensive peace. Provincial, municipal, and county councils and national vocational groups, loving the country and the nation, have never lagged behind.

<h3>If Peace Proves Hopeless - There are Two Paths to Take - Speaker Pan Points Out During Closing Remarks - A Temporary Assembly May Be Convened Again</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The closing ceremony of the Eighth General Assembly of the First Session of the Senate began yesterday evening at 8:00 PM. After formal proceedings, Speaker Qing delivered the closing remarks, followed by a speech from Mayor Wu. Senator Ji Hao responded. The closing ceremony concluded with music at approximately 9:00 PM. Speaker Pan stated: "Today is the closing day of the Eighth General Assembly of this session. During this session, we had the opportunity to celebrate the solar New Year, and the fact that this assembly was still able to heatedly discuss various proposals related to this city is truly gratifying. The recent reading of the President's proclamation in the newspapers has given the people great enlightenment, providing new hope for the millions of people in Shanghai. This assembly has already taken the lead in sending a telegram calling for peace, and other senates and people's organizations in various regions have responded one after another. This shows that everyone today is hoping for the arrival of peace, which is 'people sharing the same wish, hearts sharing the same reason'. However, based on my personal observations, I believe that achieving peace is not an easy task. Since the President's proclamation calling for peace was issued, the Communist Party has not responded in any way. We certainly hope that the Communist Party can consider the suffering of the people, abandon the war, and make peace a reality as soon as possible. But what if the Communist Party cannot give up and insists on fighting to the end? I believe that there are only two paths we can take: one is to lay down our arms and wait for the Communist Party to drive straight in and rule the country, and we will become slaves and beasts under their rule. The other is to support the anti-communist government to fight to the end and achieve true peace. Based on the above, it would be ideal to achieve peace at a low cost, but if that doesn't work, we must be prepared to pay the greatest price. We must thoroughly ensure that those with money contribute money and those with strength contribute strength. At that time, this assembly may very likely convene a temporary assembly again to actively discuss and make decisions. I hope that at that time, everyone will not argue about who contributes more or less."</p>
<p>The Decrease in Proposals is a Sign of Progress</p>
<p>"Furthermore, this assembly session was brief, but important proposals were carefully reviewed by the review committee, and all cases were processed sequentially by the assembly, which is very gratifying. Some people have recently argued that the number of proposals during the Senate's meetings is decreasing and that many senators are no longer interested in the proposals. However, I do not think that is the case; on the contrary, I believe that it is a sign of progress. The reason I think it is a sign of progress is that, with regard to the proposals of this assembly, if a proposal is not made, it will be considered unimportant. If it is made, it must be important and we should strive to implement it. Also, I have some reservations about the regulation that more than half of the members must be present for a meeting to be held. This regulation is unique to China. Fortunately, the central government has now realized this, so when the Legislative Yuan holds meetings, it considers it legal if one-fifth of the members are present. I firmly believe that this point will be revised and improved in the future, because democratic politics are experienced from actual experience. China is currently still in its infancy, but it will gradually grow, and we can be absolutely optimistic."</p>
<p>The Mayor Hopes the People Will Have the Greatest Confidence</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's speech briefly stated: "The Speaker just discussed the progress of the Senate and the prospects for peace, and I agree very much. I also believe that if peace is hopeless, the Senate has the possibility of convening a temporary meeting. During this turbulent situation, it is most difficult for those in charge of central or local administrative agencies. Many things cannot be handled, such as rent issues, public utility price issues, tuition issues, etc., which cannot be resolved. Therefore, I have a feeling that perhaps I committed some transgression in a previous life, and I am being punished in this life to serve as a local administrative official. In today's situation, I only hope that the people can understand the government's difficulties and have the greatest confidence. I also hope that the senators will constantly provide guidance to the municipal government."</p>
<p>Senator Ji's Response Emphasizes the Importance of Three Proposals</p>
<p>Ji Hao stated in his response: "I personally believe that among the various proposals passed by this assembly, there are three basic and important ones: (1) The universal education proposal. The government should do its best to promote its completion, because education is the foundation of national construction. (2) The organization of military-civilian cooperation stations is very important in today's war-torn situation and is of great importance to the public security of the suburbs and the city. I hope that the government will handle it quickly. (3) Adjust the district and protection organizations and improve self-defense capabilities. People are born into the world, survival comes first, and life comes second. As long as we give full play to our own strength, all problems can be solved. Also, the solar New Year has brought us news of peace, but whether it can be realized depends on the sincerity of the Communist Party. Now everyone is looking forward to the Communist Party's awakening so that peace can come. But we also hope that since the government has opened the door to peace, it must have a large capacity and be based on the will and strength of the people. Only in this way can we achieve true peace."</p>

<h3>Salt Merchant Staying at Friend's Home - Gold Jewelry Stolen</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Longyu, a 49-year-old salt merchant from Changsha, resides at No. 63 Fanhuangdu Road, Shanghai West, and his family is well-off. Yang has a colleague and friend named Shen Song, 57 years old. Recently, because he has a trip to Taiwan, he temporarily brought his wife to Yang's residence to wait for the flight. Last New Year's Eve, Shen's wife took out her gold jewelry and other items stored in the bank, including a large gold bar (weighing five taels), two small gold bars, three taels of gold ingots, a gold lock pendant with a chain weighing three taels, a gold coin (weighing one tael), two gold watch bands, a jade ring, and two British gold pounds with inlaid edges. She packed them into a package, put them in a black briefcase, and at the same time, she also put 6,000 gold yuan (in four bundles) in the leather bag. Below the gold jewelry were 15 US dollars, clipped between two 500 yuan Guan Jin notes, also placed in the bag. The briefcase was placed in the five-drawer chest in the room and was not locked. When Shen Song returned from outside at dusk on the third day, he noticed that Yang had a friend dancing downstairs, and his wife also participated. Not long after, he went upstairs and realized that something was wrong with the leather bag in the five-drawer chest. He checked it and found that the four bundles of gold yuan were still there, but the package of gold jewelry on the lower level was missing. He initially thought it was hidden by his wife. However, when his wife returned to the room after dancing and he asked her, he realized that it had been stolen. He immediately reported the situation to the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau. After Chief Yu ordered patrolman Meng Ruisheng to lead the police to investigate, he also summoned male and female servants to the bureau for interrogation, but there are still no clues.</p>

<h3>Prices Generally Rise by 30% to 50% - The Surge in Cotton Cloth is Especially Fierce - Credit Tightens, Interest Rates Rise in the Dark, People Still See Good Prospects</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The intensity of the price increase in the red market this year has exceeded general expectations. The prices of major daily necessities this morning increased by 30% to 50% compared to the closing of the market last year. The market began to decline in the afternoon. The buying price for foreign exchange transfer certificates was 134 yuan this morning, and the selling price was 135 yuan (New Year's Eve was 120 yuan). High-grade white japonica rice was 810 yuan per dan in the northern market yesterday and 780 yuan in the southern market (New Year's Eve was 670 yuan). The market price of 120-count raw silk was 53,000 yuan this morning, once reaching 56,000 yuan at the highest point, and closed at 47,000 yuan in the evening (New Year's Eve was 41,500 yuan). The highest market price for 20-count Bianma brand cotton yarn yesterday was 37,500 yuan, and it fell back to 35,000 yuan at noon (New Year's Eve was around 31,000 yuan). The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 50,500 yuan this morning, and it fell to 49,000 yuan in the afternoon (New Year's Eve was 47,500 yuan). The price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rose surprisingly, reaching a high of 1,510 yuan this morning, with an average of 1,410 yuan. By the closing of the market in the evening, off-market transactions were selling at 1,350 yuan (New Year's Eve was 960 yuan).</p>
<p>During this red market price surge, the price of cotton cloth rose the most fiercely. According to industry insiders, the price of cotton cloth is closely related to overseas remittances. Therefore, the Central Bank's increase in the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates greatly stimulated the price of cotton cloth. It is also heard that the Central Bank will continue to increase the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. Therefore, although credit has tightened, people still see good prospects. In addition, the high balancing fee of 4,500 yuan for exchanging gold directly stimulated the rise in gold prices. Those who applied to the Shenzhu for exchange yesterday were required to pay on the same day, but could not pick up the goods until a week later. The price of 50 US dollars in overseas remittances was 6,500 yuan. Adding the interest on the discount, it exceeded 8,000 yuan. Therefore, it is natural that the dark market price of gold fees was as high as over 8,000 yuan. Also, credit tightened in the afternoon yesterday, and the hidden interest rate has increased to 50 yuan per day. If relevant authorities can sell a large amount of goods, then credit will continue to tighten and the price trend may temporarily stabilize.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Opening of the Red Board: Cotton Yarn Reaches Record High Prices; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Soars to $54,000</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn saw a unanimous rise on the opening of the red board, with strong demand from all sides, boosting morale. The trading floor saw heavy buying, and holders were reluctant to sell.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened at $51,000, briefly reaching a high of $54,000. Towards the close, due to government selling, sentiment softened, and the afternoon session closed back down to $50,000. This was still an increase of around $11,000 compared to before the holiday. 40-count Blue Phoenix was bid up to $49,000, and 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at $40,000. Although it briefly climbed to $43,000, it retreated near the opening price at closing, settling at $40,500, a jump of $9,000.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at $36,500, reaching close to the $40,000 mark. The afternoon session was $1,000 lower than the opening price, at $35,500, ultimately rising $9,500. Warehouse receipts closed at $33,000, with one-day arbitrage at $1,500. 20-count Double Horse slipped from $34,000 to close at $32,000.

<h3>Cotton Cloth Soars</h3>
<p>Although the market was closed during the holiday, transactions occurred outside the market, with prices gradually rising. Yesterday, the opening price for the red board was $1,480 for first-grade fine cloth, and $1,440 for Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi. During the session, both domestic and foreign buyers showed strong demand, further pushing prices upward. Towards the close, news spread that the national bank was selling large quantities of yarn and cloth to absorb idle funds, causing nervousness. Ultimately, resistance was futile, and the former retreated to $1,410, still a substantial increase of $450 compared to before the holiday. The latter closed at $1,300, a rise of $400. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong fell from $1,460 to close at $1,370, ultimately up $460. High-end 190 Shilin Factory boards were at $3,000, printed twill at $1,450, and other cloths were up about 30% compared to before the holiday. However, the foundation is still weak, and a decline is possible today.</p>
<h3>Banks Pay Reserve Requirements; Government Bonds and Treasury Bills Still Acceptable as Collateral</h3>
<p>But Not to Exceed Fifty Percent</p>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the reserve requirements for banks, the Ministry of Finance, based on the provisions of the Banking Law and considering the circumstances at the time, previously stipulated six implementation measures. Items 2, 3, and 4 specified the ratios for various banks to pay, and item 5 stipulated that government bonds and treasury bills could be used to offset up to 30% of the required deposit amount, as well as the valuation standards for bonds. Later, to strengthen credit contraction, the implementation of item 5, which allowed government bonds and treasury bills to offset up to 51%, was temporarily suspended. It is now understood that the Ministry of Finance, in order to encourage banks to attract deposits, will continue to implement the original regulations for the deposit rates of guarantee reserves for various banks. Furthermore, item 5, which was previously suspended, will be reinstated, allowing various banks in different regions to use government bonds to offset the deposited amount as appropriate, without restrictions. However, the valuation standards for bonds will still be handled according to the original item 5.</p>

<h3>Government Sells Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the money supply was not tight, but the high exchange balancing fee caused prices to skyrocket.

<h3>Decision on How Financial Firms Can Increase Capital</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of financial firms depositing cash from increased capital into the Central Bank, it was handled properly on December 31st of last year. According to responsible persons from the Banking Association, regarding the methods for using these deposited funds, in addition to the Ministry-stipulated methods for using deposited capital and the supplement authorizing the Central Bank to approve the use of funds for mortgage loans with a term of one month or more, the association has discussed and decided on the following detailed rules with the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau:</p>
<p>(1) If each bank needs to use these funds, it can fill out a form and send it to the association for verification, which will then be forwarded to the Financial Management Bureau. The funds can be used after joint approval by the Bureau and the Central Bank.</p>
<p>(2) This flexible method of using funds is being handled by the association on behalf of each bank. Therefore, the application must be verifiable and attributable, focusing on being realistic. This is to avoid difficulties when the association's representatives attend consultations at the Financial Management Bureau.</p>
<p>(3) The association has invited Mr. Xu Xie Kang from Shanghai Bank and Mr. Cai Songfu from Dunxu Bank to come to the association every day to review the applications from each bank, and will also send personnel to each bank to verify the accounts to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>(4) When each bank sends its first application to the association, it should attach a copy of its year-end balance sheet for review.</p>
<p>(5) If applying to make credit loans, the amount should follow the bank's regulations and must not exceed 25% of its total deposits.</p>
<p>(6) For funds that have been approved for use for the first time, if a bank needs to continue the application upon expiration, it should make arrangements in advance, and it is best if the amount is equal to ensure continuity.</p>
<p>(7) The application for using these funds is negotiated under the principle of not violating the Ministry-stipulated methods for using deposited capital, adopting a cyclical application method, lasting for three months. Therefore, the interval between each application and the amount of each application should be divided into several periods by each bank, and the amounts should be evenly distributed to facilitate review.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Trade Deficit for November Last Year</h3>

Goods from China transiting through Hong Kong were valued at HK$47,625,992, and imports were valued at HK$43,290,1390.</p>
<h3>Rising Prices at Origin; Rice Prices Rise Across the Board; White Rice in North City Breaks $800 Mark</h3>
<p>The rice market is rising sharply due to rising prices at the origin, which are higher than the declared prices. Furthermore, the prices of miscellaneous grains and edible oils rose the previous day, leading to exceptionally strong sentiment. The market opened with a surge, and white rice in the North City market has broken the $800 mark, reaching $810. Bo Dao Yangxian is also approaching the $800 mark, with each rising by a substantial $180, an increase of 30%. White Yuan is as high as $850. In the South City market, white rice and Bo Dao each opened at $780, up $130 and $140 respectively, and Special Jing was at $820. Yesterday's arrivals totaled 6,872 piculs.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The rise has not stopped, and sentiment remains bullish. Retail demand is quite strong. With rice prices rising, sellers are raising prices. The Central Market is the most popular. Although prices slightly retreated at closing, the overall increase was still substantial. Old Car Flour opened at $380, reaching $390 at one point, and closed at $385, up $48. Bingchuan Flour closed at $381, up $46. Red Bee closed at $363, and Jiancheng closed at $350, each up more than $40. Large bags of wheat bran rose sharply by more than $30.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Prices rose first and then retreated, with both firm and weak results. However, the market sentiment at closing was very weak. Soybeans initially rose by $50, but then demand weakened, retreating by $20, ultimately rising by $30 and $40. Corn opened steady, and closed down by $10 and $20. Red Sorghum rose slightly by $10, but there were no buyers at closing. Yuan Wheat was steady. Sesame was rarely offered, rising by $100. Guan Dian White Sesame was at $1,200. Raw Peanuts rose again. Yangzhou Tizhuang Raw Peanuts were at $1,900, a sharp increase of $150.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Prices initially rose and then fell, ultimately closing higher, but the market sentiment at closing was very weak. The market opened with bullish sentiment due to rising rice prices. Soybean oil opened outside of $3,000, reaching as high as $3,200. Later, due to excessively high prices, demand was sluggish, and sellers sold at the high. Soybean oil closed back down to $3,000, at $2,950, up $150. Rapeseed oil closed at $2,800, up $200. Raw oil was at $3,000. Small Car Sesame Oil closed at $2,520. Soybean cake initially rose and then remained flat, ultimately remaining stable.</p>
<h3>Import Visa Fee Changes Effective Yesterday</h3>

Payment will be calculated based on the closing price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate on the day before payment.</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs announces: The minimum value threshold for consularly-visaed imported goods will be raised to $4,000, effective immediately. The consular visa fee for shipping documents will be raised to $200 per set.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Shows Potential for Profit</h3>
<p>The tea market opened this morning, continuing the momentum from before the holiday. With other goods in the market showing prosperity, sellers showed a profitable posture and raised prices. The red board price went straight up. Despite other goods falling back slightly, tea prices were not affected, showing signs of being easy to rise but hard to fall. Transactions were few due to difficult negotiations between buyers and sellers.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Rises</h3>
<p>Tung oil prices rose steadily yesterday, with the red board opening with a strong showing. Later, negative news emerged, and reports of falling prices for other goods caused sentiment to weaken slightly. However, compared to last year, the overall increase was still substantial.</p>
<h3>Business Briefs</h3>
<p>The timber tea party started on the 2nd. Opening prices were higher than last year, and the market became firmer on the 3rd and 4th. The rise was particularly large for fir strips. Large and small strips opened at $4.45, and Wu Fen Song and Tang Hu boards also generally rose by about 20%. Western pine plywood also followed suit, rising by several yuan. Hang timber saw few transactions.</p>
<p>Rubber opened on the red board with general increases of around 30%. Prices rose again yesterday amid rising prices for other goods, reaching unprecedented peaks.</p>
<p>Construction materials prices rose across the board. Large green bricks opened at $9,500, small bricks at $5,000, and yellow sand rose to $1,700 per cubic meter. Cement factory prices have not yet been determined, but bids at the tea party were at $180 to $200. Roofing asphalt was also popular, selling for $13 per pound.</p>
<h3>Intestine Export Suddenly Improves, Could Recover to Pre-War Levels</h3>
<p>According to sources in the sausage casing export industry: Shanghai sausage casing exports reached over 300 barrels in December of last year, breaking the record since the victory. The reason is that since the implementation of the foreign exchange transfer certificate, its selling price has been rising daily. At this time, domestic prices are relatively stable, which is stimulating exports.</p>
<p>Another reason is that in December of last year, the main sources of small intestine supply, the areas around Bengbu and Hefei, were relatively peaceful, and transportation between Wuhu and Shanghai was also relatively smooth, allowing the production areas to continue to supply goods.</p>
<p>According to industry insiders, before the war, the national average monthly export of sausage casings was about 1,000 barrels, with Shanghai accounting for 600 barrels. Currently, the domestic cost of sausage casing is about 18 yuan per set, and the foreign FOB price is US$0.18 per set. Based on the market price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate (about 24 gold yuan), if the foreign exchange transfer certificate continues to improve, general exporters will rush to purchase, and sausage casing factories that have been closed for a long time will resume operations one after another. If the current situation remains unchanged, sausage casing exports in January of this year could reach 500 barrels, and it will not be difficult to restore to pre-war levels in the near future.</p>

<h3>New Year in Nantong; New Personnel, New Policies</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Ye Yongshu</p>
<p>[Our Report, Nantong, 2nd] On New Year's Eve in Nantong, it was drizzling, not too heavy, not too light. Everyone thought that the next day would definitely be rainy. However, the New Year's Day of the thirty-eighth year was unexpectedly different: the rain stopped, the clouds dispersed, and the sun began to peek at the earth from the seams of the clouds. The mood of the people of Nantong for the New Year was like the weather: sunlight was peeking onto the sensitive hearts of the people.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this Gregorian New Year, and as the lunar calendar entered December, those who followed the new calendar have already reviewed the past and planned for the future. Those who followed the old calendar were also preparing for a summary at this time.</p>
<p>During this time of "getting rid of the old and bringing in the new," a new lineup has been arranged in the Nantong officialdom. County Magistrate Chen Gengyao has been in office for almost a year, which is considered the longest tenure among the county magistrates of Nantong since the restoration. He claims to be physically weak and often ill. In reality, it is because the county's finances are tight and he is unable to turn the situation around, so he has repeatedly telegraphed his resignation. The provincial government approved his resignation at the last meeting of the thirty-seventh year and reassigned him, replacing him with Huang Xiangchen, the county magistrate of Jiangning County. Coincidentally, the chief of the county police bureau, the director of the tax collection office, and the president of the local court have also been replaced with new personnel. The New Year, with new personnel and new policies, should be a refreshing change.</p>
<p>December Yellow Soil Worth More Than Silver</p>
<p>"December yellow soil is worth more than silver." This year is no exception. In the second half of December, the magnitude of price fluctuations broke the price increase record since the currency system reform and the lifting of price controls. Especially on the 27th and 28th, there were multiple price changes in one day, and the people were panicked and almost unable to live their days. Among them, rice was the most affected. Compared to the rice prices in Wuxi and Shanghai, it was two to two and a half times more expensive. Hai'an to the north and Haimen to the east are much lower. This is an abnormal phenomenon.</p>
<p>Organizing a Merchant Fleet to Transport Rice</p>
<p>The Nantong Command's Economic Office paid close attention to this matter and convened relevant agencies and grain merchants on the afternoon of New Year's Eve to discuss the two issues of unblocking the source of grain and approving grain prices. Although Nantong is a city close to the rice-producing area of Lixiahe, it is affected by poor transportation and social unrest, and cannot purchase locally. Instead, it has to purchase from the Jiangnan Wuxi area. Recently, some ports in the Jiangyin area have been blockaded, and the 8,000 piculs of rice that had already been purchased cannot be transported. At the symposium, it was decided that the Grain Industry Association would be responsible for organizing a merchant fleet, reporting to the Jiangyin Fortress Command and the Nantong Command for record-keeping, to transport the purchased grain. At the meeting, rice prices were rigidly regulated. From New Year's Day onwards, white glutinous rice was set at 1,000 yuan per picul, second-grade glutinous rice at 950 yuan, indica rice at 870 yuan, and second-grade indica rice at 810 yuan. Subsequently, the flour mills will use the false Wuxi standard, plus half a sheng of ascending power, half a sheng of descending power — seven he of descending Douli, seven sheng of freight, and the remittance water for remittances to Wuxi, and the legal profit of three sheng, totaling less than two dou, that is, the Nantong rice price should not exceed 20% of the Wuxi rice price.</p>
<p>Three Reasons for the Coolness of Cotton Collection</p>
<p>Cotton is the source of wealth for Nantong. After autumn, the entire Nantong market directly and indirectly relies on the money earned by farmers selling cotton to activate it. However, the cotton market last year was unusually deserted. There were as many as 10 to 20 Jiangnan manufacturers coming to Nantong to collect cotton at the end of the year before last, but last year they "hesitated to move forward." The year before last, the China Textile Corporation (CTC) collected more than 100,000 dan of cotton here, but last year the State Cotton Nantong Joint Purchasing Office did not even collect 30,000 dan. The difference is huge. According to analysis, there are three main reasons for this: During the price control period, because the price was too low, cotton farmers were unwilling to sell, so there were almost no transactions. Later, after the price controls were lifted, cotton merchants were unwilling to buy in due to social unrest and uncertainty. Recently, it could be done, but the weather was not cooperating, with continuous rain and inconvenient transportation, so there were not many transactions either. In addition to the Joint Purchasing Office, Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory is also collecting cotton, but it is using the method of exchanging yarn for cotton. Currently, it is stipulated that 830 catties of lint can be exchanged for one bale of 20-count Red Kui yarn.</p>
<p>Three Examples of "Colluding to Oppress the People"</p>
<p>On December 26, the Kuomintang Daily published an "Alternate Theory" entitled "To Win Back the Hearts of the People, Root Out Corruption and Malpractice," listing examples of "colluding to oppress the people": "(1) A grain industry person in the ninth district without any learning (chairman of the grain association), actually took the opportunity to forcibly collect more than one-tenth of the in-kind grain from passing grain boats. (2) A non-drafted young man in the fourth district was actually sent to the yamen in a daze, and spent a certain amount of cotton yarn as the price to get off the 'Looking Home Terrace.' (3) Also: It is rumored that there is a tax ticket fraud case, with many accomplices, colluding to form a gang, what else is there to say." These are just three examples. All these opinions and public opinion agencies have been notified, but the listeners still ignore them. It is hoped that these blemishes of Nantong will disappear with the old year, and that a new face will come with the New Year.</p>
<p>The Newspaper Industry Is Struggling</p>
<p>Let's talk about the newspaper industry in Nantong. Under the successive blows of "price controls," "opening," and "price increases," the newspaper industry in Nantong has reached its most difficult stage. This New Year's Day, apart from using red ink, changing New Year's advertisements, and the usual few celebratory articles, there was nothing unusual. If we had to find something special, the change in the layout of the Tongbao this year would be considered a major event in the news industry. Under the threat of price increases, a four-page newspaper has been in arrears with wages for three months, and it is impossible to pay even a small amount of money for the New Year. Although the economic conditions of the newspaper are the same, the journalists here do not complain, and mostly use their limited free time to take on other odd jobs to maintain their personal livelihoods. As for the newspaper, they are always struggling to support it.</p>
<h3>Neglectful Guarding: Five Important Criminals in Suzhou Escape from Prison</h3>
<p>[Our Report, Suzhou, 4th] The county's local court detention center, due to the negligence of the guards on the night of December 31st of last year, had five important incarcerated criminals escape from prison. One was Zhou Jigen, who had already been sentenced to death for murder for money, and the other four were sentenced to more than 10 years of imprisonment. The escape of the five criminals was discovered on New Year's Day, and searches were carried out everywhere. However, the escaped criminals had already fled far away and have not yet been captured.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders All Counties and Cities to Quickly Form Enlistment Teams</h3>
<p>[Our Report, Zhenjiang, 4th] In order to lay the foundation for conscription in all counties and cities in Jiangsu Province and to ensure that civilian self-defense training is coordinated with military service, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has telegraphed all county and city governments, starting in January, to organize young people aged 20 to 25 and those of military age in the county into "enlistment teams" in order to facilitate conscription this year. As soon as the quota is announced, they will quickly carry out conscription.</p>
<h3>Pocket News</h3>

<p>[Our Report] Ma Xujin, the administrator of the former Xintai Office of the Field Grain Office, embezzled more than 1,700 piculs of rice and could not make up for it. Although former County Magistrate Fan and former Field Grain Office Zheng Dingfang came to the county to mediate, the newspapers believed that the case was serious and that, in addition to compensating for the embezzled rice, he should be severely punished. The case was concluded on the 31st by Judge Liu of the local court, who sentenced him to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Wuxing</p>

<p>[Our Report] The case of the collection of field tax in early rice in the county, due to the fact that most of the agricultural income is grain, and the provincial government ordered the flexible conversion to 30,000 shi of gold yuan, has aroused suspicion among people from all walks of life that the collectors are committing fraud. They have requested that the names of the income households, acreage, and location of the villages be publicly announced to dispel public doubts. It is now understood that the field tax collection offices in the five early rice districts of Chengdong, Qihuang, Fengqiao, Wangdian, and Buyun have submitted the converted accounts to the County Field Grain Office, and the County Office has transferred the accounts to the County Council for review at the next county government review meeting.</p>
