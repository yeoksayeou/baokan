<h3>槍砲聲昨澈夜不絕　解放軍今晨入市區　守軍後撤菁華區幸保全</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕人民解放軍已於今晨進入上海市區，同時市區守軍亦已撤退。徐家匯常熟嵩山等區，約於今晨一時起絡續有共軍開入，至今晨四時左右，老閘黃浦等區亦已到達。舊法租界若干區域，曾發生局部小接觸，槍聲四起，居民大都從夢中驚醒，但因無砲擊事件發生，故市區精華，未受損失。共軍自衛山路一帶，分隊向東徐徐推進，紀律甚佳，秩序井然。有公私機關職員與之遭遇者，於檢查身份後，並不留難，但囑歸返辦公地點，保留物資靜待接收而已。至郊區砲戰聲昨仍澈夜不絕。</p>
<p>按上海之戰，自本月十二日正式揭幕，迄昨逾旬，雙方爭奪重心，始終為浦江出海口之兩岸戰略要地，重心北移，市區在事實上已無軍事價值，兼以雙方珍視上海百年來之建設成績，故在最後階段中，上海精華之區能幸免戰爭之破壞。</p>
<h3>郵件依然暢通　廣州台北重慶香港　昨日互有航郵來去</h3>

<h3>平國立大學學生　討論人民助學金</h3>
<p>〔北平新華電台廿四日廣播〕北平市各國立大學學生，現在正熱烈而嚴肅地展開關於人民助學金的討論，許多學生在經過討論以後，認清了舊公費的本質，是國民黨對付愛國學生的卑劣陰謀，而人民助學金，是勞動人民節衣縮食來培養新中國建設人才的血汗，因此紛紛自動放棄申請，或降低申請等級。北大農學院學生，最初申請助學金的佔百分之九十，經過討論以後，三十四個申請甲種助學金的學生减少為十八個，有二個申請乙種的改為丙種，其餘院校學生也都紛紛退讓申請。</p>

<p>昨在克林姆宮開幕</p>
<p>〔塔斯社莫斯科廿三日電〕俄羅斯聯邦最高蘇維埃第三屆大會，於廿四日在大克林姆宮開幕。</p>
<h3>愛因斯坦等名流　在美召開大會　反對大西洋公約</h3>
<p>〔塔斯社華盛頓廿三日電〕由著名物理學愛因斯坦，作家托馬斯曼以及其他名流所發起在華盛頓召開的兩天的大會，已於廿一日開幕。此項大會有一百二十五位教育家代表，牧師，各公共團體領袖等人參加，並曾通過決議，抨擊北大西洋公約，認為它是對和平的威脅。</p>

<h3>日衆院開會期　決延長兩日</h3>
<p>議塲一度發生紛擾</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿四日電〕日本衆院昨晚於最後一分鐘，決定將本屆會期再延長兩日，此乃第三度延長，當時議塲秩序異常混亂。參院討論延長會期案時，政府黨與反對黨議員竟發生鬥毆，致不得不調警察維持秩序。會期所以延長，係因有若干政府法案不能留待下屆會議討論。</p>
<h3>美軍援計劃</h3>
<p>本屆國會不致提出討論</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕美國十一億三千萬元軍事援歐計劃，能否在本屆國會討論，今日益成疑問。參議院各領袖非正式表示，此項計劃可能待至今秋特別會議討論，或至明年一月例會討論。本屆國會七月底或八月中旬休會前，決不致提前討論。至於北大西洋條約則將在本屆國會提付表决。聞國務卿艾契遜已要求參院迅速考慮此點，俾使美國在巴黎四外長會議中獲得精神上鼓勵。軍事援歐計劃之暫不討論，因恐觸共和黨之忌，共和黨正發起撙節政府支出運動。一部份贊助條約之參議員對於援助計劃表示冷淡，故民主黨領袖不致催促討論此計劃。</p>

<h3>柏林鐵路罷工　衝突仍未止</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿四日電〕就廿四日的跡象而言，因柏林架空鐵道工人罷工而引起的衝突，又將繼續至第四日。在過去三日的戰鬥中，已有一千二百人被槍擊傷或毆傷，三人被擊死。一萬五千反共罷工工人的領袖已誓言將對抗共黨鐵路保安隊的槍擊。佔領西柏林全部六十七個架空鐵道站。英佔領當局因共黨反罷工者任意開槍而激怒，於昨晚自蘇區警察保安隊手下奪回車站兩處，並獲得渠等將放棄其他車站的諾言。在英區動物院車站激戰後，局勢又趨緊張，當罷工工人向該站進攻時，共黨鐵路保安隊開槍，死二，重傷二，輕傷多人。英軍政府公共安全處長史蒂威特立卽限令其在二十分鐘內退出該站，當為站內的一百五十人至二百人左右的共黨保安隊接受。此時罷工工人仍包圍叫囂，準備進攻。共黨保安隊在子夜開始乘車撤出，西區警察乃進駐該站，撤退時罷工工人追踪攻擊，又遭槍擊，據估計在五十發以上。</p>
<h3>關於德國未來問題　蘇聯將實行攤牌　維辛斯基在外長會中發表演說</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿四日廣播：四強外長會議第二次會議於廿四日下午二時三十分（世界標準時間）在玫瑰大理石宮舉行。</p>
<p>美駐德副軍事總督胡勃納由德抵此，隨同艾契遜出席本日會議，預料維辛斯基對於有關德國問題之蘇聯新政策將實行攤牌。西方列強擬在二次會議中給予維氏機會，以說明其對於德國未來問題究竟作何打算。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿四日電〕四強外長會議將於今日下午二時卅分格林威治時間，（上海時間下午十一時卅分）進入最緊要階段。四國外長在同意議程以後，卽將着手處理議程第一項：德國政治經濟統一問題，並包括盟國佔領諸問題。西方外長等待維辛斯基關於此一問題的開幕演說，俾使渠等獲得概念，卽蘇聯是否將利用此次會議繼續其宣傳攻勢，抑的確準備談判。維辛斯基的演說，將使其有機會透露蘇聯的要求，據一般揣測，此等要求將為：（一）一切駐德佔領軍及早撤退。（東歐國家在華沙會議時卽有此建議）。（二）西方國家計劃。（按西德憲法業在廿三日被批准，西德國的建立已不啻為旣成事實，雖然政府及議會均將遲至七月間選舉成立）。（三）西方國家放鬆渠等對東德貿易的限制。（許多人都認為此卽促使蘇聯解除柏林封鎖的主因）。西方國家在德國未成為和平的民主國家，及其他歐洲國家免於侵略的安全未獲保障前，對任何及早結束佔領的計劃，必然將予拒絕。西方外長對維辛斯基關於日本的建議，則並不重視。</p>
<h3>四點議程商定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿三日電〕四國外長今日在玫瑰</p>
<p>大理石宮中開始會議，蘇聯新外長維辛斯基提出日本和約問題。此乃蘇方喜歡在此種會議揭幕時所採取外交上的「驚奇行動」。惟參與會議之若干人士認為此舉，亦可能表示蘇方此次擬在遍及全球之冷戰中，　取全面性之停戰。維辛斯基並未堅持對此建議立刻採取行動，四國外長乃通過四點議事程序如下：</p>
<p>（一）德國統一問題，包括經濟與政治原則以及盟國之管制。（二）柏林問題，包括全市使用一種貨幣問題在內。（三）準備對德和約。（四）研討和約格式以恢復奧國獨立。</p>
<p>會議開始以主人資格任主席之法外長許曼提出此四點議事程序，事先西方三國對此已商獲同意。維辛斯基亦提出其本人之議事程序，內包括四強管制柏林及柏林一般問題，至於奧國問題則未提及。但維氏旋卽撤回其議事程序而接受許曼所提出之前四點議程。</p>
<p>外長會議最後通過艾契遜建議，由四國外長代表對於奧國和約問題，於六月一日提出報告。</p>
<h3>維辛斯基突以驚人姿態　提議討論日和約　英美未同意此議暫擱置</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿三日電〕四強外長今日開會同意本屆外長會之議程後，蘇聯外長維辛斯基突以驚人姿態，提出了遠東和約的整個問題。渠認與會諸外長或許應該提出另一點，卽對日和約問題。此事雖不在本屆會議議程之內，但顯然為各外長所念念不忘。維辛斯基表示蘇聯代表團願意曉得外長會議將於何時舉行下屆會議連中國在內，共同處理對日和約問題。</p>
<p>美國務卿艾契遜當答以此非目前應提出討論之問題。並曰，在波茨坦會議設立外長會議之初，並未談及日本問題，其後有遠東委員會之成立，專門討論日本問題，故日本問題根本與外長會議無關。雖然，渠仍準備在較遲的階段中，討論維辛斯基提出的問題。就渠個人言，若未奉訓令或在目前階段，均未便討論日本和約問題。貝文贊助艾氏意見稱，對日和會不由紐西蘭·澳洲·巴基斯坦及印度參加，英國碍難同意。維辛斯基當表示渠並未建議此一問題必須置入本屆會議議程之內惟覺自上屆外長會以來已有十七閱月，故毋妨一查前途尚有何項問題待下屆會議討論。維辛斯基並曰，中國並未參加外長會中就義匈羅保芬諸國和約，或德奧條約之討論，良以此等條約並不與中國直接有關之故。至於日本和約，則無疑的為中國所直接感覺興趣。主席法外長許曼認為維辛斯基的問題，似不宜在目前卽成立決議。維氏當表示同意此項意見。第一次會議乃於開會兩小時半後散會。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿三日電〕蘇外長維辛斯基今日經由其發言人巴夫洛夫發表談話，謂蘇聯代表團對本屆巴黎外長會之收穫，並不悲觀。記者詢問當維辛斯基在今日之會議中提出日本和約問題，強調應有中國代表參加日本和約討論時，其所指之中國係那一個中國政府。巴夫洛夫僅曰，維辛斯基僅擬到中國。巴氏並曰，維氏之提出日本問題，為表示爭取主動。四外長今已同意在本屆會議較遲的階段中討論此事。</p>
<h3>本屆外長會　需時約兩週</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿二日電〕美區德文報聲稱：據接近蘇軍政府之人士透露，史達林元帥相信本屆外長會議或將　續兩週。史達林相信各主要問題，可望迅速成立協定。蘇聯在此次會議中所取之戰略，已由史達林與維辛斯基在克林姆宮中密商五日後決定。</p>
<h3>美國駐日佔領軍隊　顯有長期留駐意　移交文官管理迄無具體計劃</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕陸軍次長伏希斯今日在衆院撥款委員會稱，陸軍部甚欲結束日本之軍管理，移交文官管理，惟尚無具體計劃。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕據衆院撥款委員會廿三日公佈的證辭中透露，陸軍部希望國務院立卽接管日本及德國，不過陸軍部發言人認為，在日本不能保衛其本身前，不應任其處在無保衛中，因此，相當數量的美軍，將長期留駐日本。但委員會建議，在許多次要事務中，不論工業或其他佔領事務，其指導人員應由日本人逐漸代替美國人員。</p>
<p>陸軍部次長伏希斯及前駐日第八軍長艾契堡在撥款委員會對陸軍佔領政策及願望作證，伏許斯稱：「陸軍部担任日本及德國的佔領事務，其時期已過長」。陸軍部將在何時卸除責任，則有待國務院或其他機構將在何時準備接管而定。</p>

<h3>金市買氣閑散　銀元市况正常</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市塲，因各方均無心交易，成交殊稀。在供多求少下，市勢欲漲乏力，塲內漲停板為一三七億五千九百四十萬，已漸與塲外價格軋近。今日可望恢復買賣。塲外因風聲頗緊，買氣閑散。晨開一三〇億，一六〇億，曾高至一五〇億，一八〇億，午收一四〇億，一七〇億，午後仍升至一五〇億，一八〇億收盤。較上日無分軒輊。</p>
<p>塲外美鈔亦步亦趨，晨開二七〇〇萬，三二〇〇萬，高至二八〇〇萬，三三〇〇萬，午收仍為二八〇〇萬，三二〇〇萬。午後略見砌高，升至三〇〇〇萬，三五〇〇萬，全日交易清淡，結果無甚上落。</p>
<p>錢兌業烚赤，上午掛十三億，十六億，午後掛十五億，十八億，結果亦無榮辱。</p>
<p>昨日金銀交換，再度放長二元，對搭自三九·四二，升至四〇，四三·一種貨　三九，四二，二種貨做四一，四四，惟雜洋因去化頗旺，反縮短二元，低至四六，四八。</p>
<p>金鈔交換，行市平穩，仍為四十九元，五十一元。</p>
<p>鈔銀交換，再行放長二角，對搭做七元七，八元二，一種貨做七元五，八元，二種貨做七元八，八元三，雜洋做九元，九元五。</p>
<p>飾金掉銀元，部份商號，仍多暫停買賣，少數掛四五，五〇，交易亦稀。</p>
<h3>米油雜糧市場　仍無正式交易</h3>
<p>今日可望照常集市</p>
<p>昨日南米市場，雜糧市塲，食油市塲，交易均告停頓，聞今日可望照常集市云。</p>
<p>昨日南米市塲馬路旁，聞有少數交易，價格因金價之下降而亦下疲，白粳薄稻三億，惟僅有零星交易而已。至米店門售，高低不一，秈米三億五千萬，白粳薄稻四億左右，價格略有出入。</p>
<p>食油　塲外微有做開，價格再告下游，生菜油大有餘做六千四百八十萬，挫落近二成。生豆油喊價亦挫成餘，未見正式交易。</p>
<p>雜糧　在市塲外馬路旁略有少數交易，市勢大致與上日仿佛。桑園豆一億五千四百八十萬元，此因跟蹤金價，故較疲二千萬之　。九江冬豆一二六〇〇萬元，此外開浦東泥菉下檔貨價一億三千六百八十萬元，菜菉豆一七二八〇萬元，價一致挫落。</p>
<p>麵粉　市勢平疲，然米市未開，外象更趨緊張，各方仍持觀望，交易寥落，總共不足千包，均係本街少數補進。麵粉零售店，日來銷路甚暢，　因粉價已　米價脫節頗遠，一般難民多慣於食麵粉，尤以四號粉市價便宜，最受歡迎。昨日門市零售老車粉無袋為七千二百萬至八千萬，兵船為六千萬光景。</p>
<h3>紗布交易均稀</h3>
<p>棉紗市况，昨日趨勢平凡，交易仍稀。金融性物品價格續跌，粗細紗一致跟軟。四十二支藍鳳喊四九五〇〇〇萬，續小六六〇〇〇萬。四十支卅二支各檔細紗均回降，廿一支雙馬現貨，喊價似較上日稍高，但納胃仍鮮。廿支以下一路帶小。</p>
<p>棉布以客銷停頓，門市淡泊，塲內交易又陷於休市狀態。至於物物交換，喊價較昔更為清稀。塲外喊價龍頭細布及四君子嗶嘰，與上日做價相仿。民營廠盤除龍鳳細斜等微挫五百萬元外，餘均仍站原盤。</p>
<h3>口若懸河的蘇外長　維辛斯基</h3>
<p>〔本報特稿〕巴黎四強外長會議的另一個要角，蘇聯外長維辛斯基，從二次大戰發生以來，一直是莫洛托夫的左右手。今年三月，並繼莫洛托夫後，任蘇聯外長。莫洛托夫和維辛斯基，雖然都是克林姆的紅人，但兩個人在出身和性格上，却是很不一樣的。莫洛托夫是個「老布爾雪維克」，從革命中奮鬥鍛煉出來。維辛斯基却生長在一個小資產階級的家庭裏，受正統的學院教育。莫洛托夫是嚴肅的，冷冰冰的，大部分的時間是沉默不語，而維辛斯基却是喜歡高談闊論，口若懸河，而且出言風趣，富於幽默感。所以許多人說，維辛斯基不像一個「蘇聯型」的外交家，倒像是個西方型的外交家。</p>
<p>維辛斯基於一八八三年生於烏克蘭的敖德薩，後來畢業於基輔大學法學院。一九〇二年，他加入了社會民主黨，開始獻身於社會主義的革命工作，其後的幾年，他在高加索一帶從事革命宣傳，曾數度被捕入獄。革命成功後，他執行律師業務，一九二五年，受莫斯科大學之聘，擔任法學教授。</p>
<p>到那時為止，維辛斯基還是默默無名的，國內知道他的人很少，國際方面，當然更沒有人聽說過他的大名。維辛斯基的為人們所熟知，聲譽鵲起，是在蘇聯的清黨時期。那時，他擔任清黨法庭的檢察官，在審理托派及叛國份子的過程中，他驚人的辯才，縝密的思慮，明快的決斷，都充份地表現了出來，從此，奠定了他在國內政治上的地位。一九三八年，他當選為人民委員會副主席，後改任外交委員會副主席。聯合國大會歷次開會，他都擔任蘇聯方面的代表，在會場中，常與西方國家的代表爭辯得面紅耳赤，有一次，因為當面指斥美國代表杜爾斯為「戰爭販子」，弄得兩人不歡而散。</p>
<p>維辛斯基的辯才，凡是聽過他的宏論的人，是沒有一個不欽佩的。上次聯合國大會開會時，他與英·美·澳洲諸國的代表辯論，舌戰羣儒，條理分明，用字有力，使各代表都有「不得不相信」之感。</p>
<p>去年，在某次外交塲合上，他曾說過一句話：「我相信此生不會再見戰爭」，但緊接着，又加上一句說：「但請勿忘記，我已經六十四歲了」！這兩句話是風趣中帶着沉痛的。這二十年中，人類會不會再來一次大戰呢？誰也無法逆料。但巴黎的四強外長會議，對於人類是不是能在最近期內避免愚蠢的戰禍，顯然是有着決定性的影響的。</p>

<h3>郊區難民湧入市區　臨時救濟委會　積極展開工作　目前收容人數將近萬人</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕本市自進入戰時狀態以來，各慈善團體，有鑒於戰時救濟工作之迫切需要，上月廿五日卽由中國紅十字會，紅卍字會，天主教會，基督教會，青年會，兒童福利會，佛教會，仁濟堂，同仁輔元堂等十數團體聯合組成「上海市臨時聯合救濟委員會」，直至最近，方由該會主任委員顏惠慶正式宣佈成立，日來以戰事緊張，郊區難民紛紛湧入市區，該會工作驟形忙碌，救濟事務積極展開，昨日記者曾往設於雲南中路三十五號仁濟善堂內之該會辦公處訪問，承告詳情如次：</p>
<p>青年男女數人　申請參加工作</p>
<p>該會現由常務委員會負責推進工作，常委會設主任委員一人由顏惠慶氏担任，副主委四人為前財長李思浩，慈善界董涵之，前交大校長黎照寰，四明公所蕢延芳，顏本人因養疴中山醫院，不能參加實際工作，故目前該會主要行政由李思浩氏負責較多，其他常委有朱孔嘉，徐永祚，陸梅僧，陸幹臣，徐國懋，洪念知，壽景偉，　安慶，　增復，洪士豪，孫詠沂，嚴諤聲，顏福慶，朱恒　，祝華平等，每週三六召開常委會議共策救濟工作之進行，至於該會一切實際事務，則由總幹事趙樸初，副總幹事李文杰負責處理，下設總務，給養，收容，兒童，掩埋，遣送等組，互相協助；工作人員除由該會供給午膳外，均係義務職，由參加之各團體調用。昨日記者曾見有青年男女數人自動向該會申請參加工作，足見社會上固尚有熱心人士在，該會以目前尚無需要，暫予婉却。</p>
<p>救濟難民之外　並擬救護傷病</p>
<p>該會主要工作，除救濟難民外，於必要時並擬從事救護傷病工作。該會因限於人力物力，故一切實際工作，原則由各參加團體自行辦理，該會站於輔導地位予以協助，例如仁濟堂內現已收容大塲一帶逃來難民二百餘人，又如徐家匯天主教所設之孤兒院，修道院，天文台等亦已收容難民三千二百人，十六舖蔬菜市塲亦收容二千餘人，此類由各團體自行辦理，而由該會加以協助之難民收容所，現有九處，散布市區內各地，收容人數目前將近萬人，且日有增加。</p>
<p>該會經費來源，除由內政部就存滬物資內撥捐米二千七百包，麵粉一千袋，救濟舊衣五百餘捆外，另由聯合國兒童急救基金會捐贈米·奶粉·魚肝油·麥其林等，合計數百噸，經合分署捐贈棉紗九百包，記者當詢以最近報載國際紅會，亦擬在本市辦理救濟工作，該會是否可能由此獲得若干援助，據答稱：該會目前與國際紅會尚未有所接觸。</p>
<p>審判熱心人士　捐贈現金實物</p>
<p>最近幾天，戰事日益迫切，難民人數驟增，昨天獲悉浦東方面有難民數千人，不能渡江過來，該會聞訊卽撥麵粉急請浦東同鄉會設法製就饅頭送去。目前該會深為焦慮者，厥為物資有限，而難民有增無已，長此以往，深恐無以為繼，故極盼社會上熱心人士能本己飢己溺之精神，同舟共濟，合謀解決之道，如有捐贈，不論現金實物皆所歡迎，若社會人士家有空屋，能容納三五十人，而自願收容難民者，該會亦願供給需要物資，隨時予以協助。</p>

<h3>法律釋疑</h3>
<p>〔何志成君問〕（一）鄙人於卅三年間，與某小姐正式結婚後，因在外供職，經濟艱窘，將姿寄住岳家。不料於奮曆去臘突變，將家中衣飾捲逃無踪。鄙人乃郎請假返里，逕向岳家交涉。由女母籲　兩親友從中調解，女母自認女兒背夫捲逃，並當眾干願自任全權代表，決議立合同脫離夫婦關係，雙方並各執一紙，言明立約之後，男婚女嫁各聽自由，並經雙方同時登報聲明。迄今數月毫無反應，未知在法律上是否有效。（二）鄙人將來倘有友人介紹某小姐，可否與伊結婚。（三）在結婚後，如若逃妻發覺，是否可向法院告訴丈夫遺集與重婚。（四）應行何種手續解決，方為永久有效。</p>
<p>〔答案〕（一）夫妻兩願離婚，應以書面為之，並應有二人以上證人之簽名。照來函所述情形，離婚據上，應由妻補行簽名，始有法律上之效力。（二）離婚後當可另行結婚。（三）事實上想不致有何問題。（四）依第一項解答方法辦理。</p>
<p>〔王亦遷君問〕我父在世時，曾因我家離滬而將所居之屋租與一邵姓商人，雙方言定七年為期，至今尚有二年，並且訂有合同，不得轉租於人。乃該房客乘我父故世之後，即搬往他處居住，我家房子因期限未滿，寗願空鎖，不肯交還。現我家由外埠返滬，情商遷讓未獲允許。今忽聞邵姓令伊一親戚入居，經加阻檔無效。茲有疑問數點，請求解答。（一）彼等之行動未經我等之同意，是否合法。（二）若不獲解決時，是否可訴之於法律。（三）期限未滿，而伊等又不住在內，是否可請伊等遷讓。（四）訴訟費用是否如普通人所能擔負。</p>

<h3>Gunfire Resounded Throughout the Night Yesterday; Liberation Army Entered the City This Morning; Defending Troops Withdrew, Sparing the Prosperous Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The People's Liberation Army entered the Shanghai city area this morning, while the defending troops also withdrew. Starting around 1:00 AM this morning, communist troops successively entered areas such as Xujiahui, Changshu, and Songshan. By around 4:00 AM this morning, they had also reached areas such as Laozha and Huangpu. Some minor skirmishes occurred in certain areas of the former French Concession, and gunfire erupted, awakening most residents from their sleep. However, because there were no artillery attacks, the prosperous areas of the city were spared from damage. Communist troops advanced slowly eastward along the Weishan Road area in detachments, with excellent discipline and order. Public and private sector employees who encountered them were checked for identification and not treated harshly, but were instructed to return to their workplaces and preserve their materials while awaiting takeover. The sound of artillery fire in the suburbs continued unabated throughout the night yesterday.</p>
<p>According to reports, the battle for Shanghai officially began on the 12th of this month. Over the past ten days, the focus of the struggle between the two sides has always been the strategically important areas on both banks of the Huangpu River estuary. As the focus shifted north, the city area has, in fact, lost its military value. In addition, both sides cherish the achievements of Shanghai's century of construction. Therefore, in the final stage, the prosperous areas of Shanghai were fortunately spared from the destruction of war.</p>
<h3>Mail Still Flows Smoothly; Guangzhou, Taipei, Chongqing, Hong Kong; Had Air Mail Exchanges Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Post Office News: Outgoing and incoming communications in this city remained smooth until yesterday. The mail that arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carried by airplanes, included two bags from Guangzhou, forty-seven bags from Taipei, and five bags from Chongming Nanbao Town, transported by Dalian. Mail sent from Shanghai to other areas included twenty-seven bags carried to Guangzhou by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes, thirty-two bags to Guangzhou, twelve bags to Hong Kong, seventeen bags to Chongqing, and eighteen bags to Taipei carried by Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) planes. Mail from this city to foreign countries was also carried by these flights to Hong Kong for forwarding to its final destination.</p>
<h3>Three Planes Flew Out Together This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At approximately 3:00 AM this morning, three airplanes flew over from north to south, appearing to be the last passenger planes leaving the city. It was difficult to identify them in the darkness.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, neither CNAC nor CATC had passenger flights. A notice posted at the CNAC ticket office stated: "No passenger flights today. Please inquire for information after 9:00 AM tomorrow." CATC originally planned to fly four passenger planes in the morning, but this did not materialize.</p>
<h3>Five Hand Grenades Found in a Trash Can on Ma Huo Road</h3>

<h3>Renji Charity Hall Shelters Refugees</h3>
<p>[Shanghai News Agency Report] As the flames of war intensify, the number of refugees has increased sharply. The Shanghai Renji Charity Hall, in coordination with the Shanghai Provisional Joint Relief Association, first began sheltering refugees last week. The hall is currently sheltering 247 people. However, due to the limited space and large number of people, the hall's open spaces are already full, and more than a hundred refugees are still sleeping in front of the hall.</p>
<h3>Today's Weather</h3>

<h3>Students at Peking National University Discuss People's Grants</h3>
<p>[Xinhua Radio, Beiping, 24th Broadcast] Students at various national universities in Beiping are now engaged in heated and serious discussions about the People's Grants. After discussion, many students have realized that the old public funding was a despicable conspiracy by the Kuomintang to deal with patriotic students. The People's Grants are the blood and sweat of the working people, who are scrimping and saving to cultivate talent for the construction of the new China. Therefore, they are voluntarily giving up their applications or lowering the level of their applications. Initially, 90% of the students at the Peking University College of Agriculture applied for grants. After discussion, the number of students applying for Class A grants decreased from 34 to 18, and two students applying for Class B changed to Class C. Students at other institutions have also voluntarily withdrawn their applications.</p>

<h3>Burmese Government Troops Recapture Taikkyi; Ne Win Postpones Visit to England</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 23rd Dispatch] An official announcement stated: Burmese government troops have today recaptured Taikkyi, the base of the Karen rebels, located 75 miles north of Rangoon.

<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Session Decides to Extend for Two Days</h3>
<p>Chaos Occurred on the Floor</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] The Japanese House of Representatives decided last night, at the last minute, to extend the current session for another two days. This was the third extension. The floor was extremely chaotic at the time. When the House of Councillors discussed the extension bill, members of the ruling party and opposition party even engaged in fighting, requiring police to maintain order. The session was extended because some government bills could not be left for discussion at the next session.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aid Plan</h3>
<p>Will Not Be Discussed at This Session of Congress</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] Whether the US$1.13 billion military aid to Europe plan can be discussed at this session of Congress is increasingly doubtful today. Senate leaders informally stated that the plan may be discussed at a special session this fall or at a regular session in January next year. It will definitely not be discussed before this session of Congress adjourns at the end of July or mid-August. As for the North Atlantic Treaty, it will be put to a vote at this session of Congress. It is reported that Secretary of State Acheson has requested the Senate to consider this point quickly so that the United States can receive spiritual encouragement at the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The temporary postponement of the discussion of the military aid to Europe plan is due to the fear of offending the Republicans, who are launching a campaign to cut government spending. Some senators who support the treaty have expressed coolness toward the aid plan, so the Democratic leaders will not push for discussion of this plan.</p>
<h3>A Batch of South Korean Army Officers; Has Completed Training; Assigned to Serve in the Army</h3>

The graduation ceremony included a review and a demonstration by military academy students of an infantry attack on an enemy position.</p>

Although the East and West have agreed that trade should be expanded, no concrete measures have yet been proposed. The trade group appointed by the General Assembly began secret meetings today to discuss the possibility of promoting trade relations. The Soviet Union proposed that the group find ways to reduce the dependence of European countries on the US dollar. The Czech Republic demanded that the U.S. export restriction policy be regarded as an obstacle to the development of European trade. The Eastern European bloc also requested that the commissioned group help establish Eastern European industries.</p>
<h3>Grain Transport Ships; Did Not Enter Port Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The Republic of Germany Reborn; Bonn Celebrates with Flag Raising</h3>

Speaker Arnold said that the establishment of this constitution marked the beginning of a new era in German national history. And he said: Those who survived the process of Germany's disappearance from 1933 to 1943, today seeing the rebirth of Germany, cannot help but be excited. The city of Bonn is today hanging the black, red, and gold tricolor flag of the former German Weimar Republic. The post office has also issued commemorative stamps.

The Netherlands and Belgium deeply feel that any actions taken by the four powers are bound to affect the three small countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.</p>
<h3>Berlin Railway Strike; Clashes Have Not Stopped</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 24th Dispatch] As of the 24th, the conflict caused by the Berlin elevated railway workers' strike is expected to continue for the fourth day. In the past three days of fighting, 1,200 people have been shot or beaten, and three have been shot dead. The leaders of the 15,000 anti-communist striking workers have vowed to resist the shootings by the Communist railway security forces. They have occupied all 67 elevated railway stations in West Berlin. The British occupation authorities were angered by the arbitrary shootings by the Communist anti-strikers, and last night seized two stations from the Soviet sector police security forces, and obtained their promise to abandon the other stations. After a fierce battle at the Zoologischer Garten station in the British sector, the situation became tense again. When the striking workers attacked the station, the Communist railway security forces opened fire, killing two, seriously injuring two, and slightly injuring many. Stewart, the Public Safety Director of the British military government, immediately ordered them to withdraw from the station within 20 minutes, which was accepted by the approximately 150 to 200 Communist security forces in the station. At this time, the striking workers were still surrounding and shouting, preparing to attack. The Communist security forces began to withdraw by car at midnight. West Berlin police then moved into the station. During the withdrawal, the striking workers tracked and attacked them, and were shot at again, estimated at over 50 rounds.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Future of Germany; The Soviet Union Will Implement a Showdown; Vyshinsky Delivers a Speech at the Foreign Ministers Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 24th Broadcast: The second meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference was held at 2:30 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) on the 24th at the Palais Rose de Marbre.</p>
<p>US Deputy Military Governor for Germany, Huber, arrived here from Germany to accompany Acheson to attend today's meeting. It is expected that Vyshinsky will implement a showdown on the Soviet Union's new policies on German issues. The Western powers intend to give Vyshinsky the opportunity at the second meeting to explain what exactly he intends to do regarding the future of Germany.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th Dispatch] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference will enter the most critical stage at 2:30 PM Greenwich Mean Time today (11:30 PM Shanghai time). After the four foreign ministers agree on the agenda, they will begin to deal with the first item on the agenda: the political and economic unification of Germany, including the issue of Allied occupation. The Western foreign ministers are awaiting Vyshinsky's opening speech on this issue so that they can get an idea of whether the Soviet Union will use this conference to continue its propaganda offensive or is indeed prepared to negotiate. Vyshinsky's speech will give him the opportunity to reveal the Soviet Union's demands. It is generally speculated that these demands will be: (1) The early withdrawal of all occupation forces stationed in Germany. (Eastern European countries made this suggestion at the Warsaw Conference). (2) The Western countries' plans. (Note: The West German Constitution was approved on the 23rd, and the establishment of West Germany is already a fait accompli, although the government and parliament will not be elected until July). (3) The Western countries relax their restrictions on trade with East Germany. (Many believe that this is the main reason for prompting the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin blockade). The Western countries will inevitably reject any plan for an early end to the occupation until Germany becomes a peaceful and democratic country and the security of other European countries from aggression is guaranteed. The Western foreign ministers do not attach importance to Vyshinsky's suggestion regarding Japan.</p>
<h3>Four-Point Agenda Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd Dispatch] The four foreign ministers began their conference today in the Palais Rose de Marbre. The new Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyshinsky, raised the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. This is a "surprise action" that the Soviet Union likes to take at the opening of such conferences. However, some people involved in the conference believe that this move may also indicate that the Soviet Union intends to take a comprehensive ceasefire in the global Cold War. Vyshinsky did not insist on taking immediate action on this suggestion. The four foreign ministers then passed the following four-point agenda:</p>
<p>(1) The issue of German unification, including economic and political principles and Allied control. (2) The Berlin issue, including the issue of using a single currency throughout the city. (3) Preparing a peace treaty with Germany. (4) Studying the format of the treaty to restore the independence of Austria.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Schuman, in his capacity as host, proposed these four agenda items at the beginning of the meeting. The three Western countries had agreed on this beforehand. Vyshinsky also proposed his own agenda, which included the four-power control of Berlin and general issues in Berlin, but did not mention the Austrian issue. However, Vyshinsky immediately withdrew his agenda and accepted the four-point agenda proposed by Schuman.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministers Conference finally passed Acheson's suggestion that the representatives of the four foreign ministers submit a report on the Austrian peace treaty issue by June 1.</p>
<h3>Vyshinsky Suddenly Proposes Discussing the Japanese Peace Treaty in a Surprising Manner; The UK and the US Did Not Agree to This Proposal and It Was Temporarily Shelved</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd Dispatch] After the four foreign ministers agreed on the agenda for the Foreign Ministers Conference today, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky suddenly proposed the entire issue of the Far East peace treaty in a surprising manner. He believed that the foreign ministers might also want to raise another point, namely the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. Although this was not on the agenda of this conference, it was clearly on the minds of the foreign ministers. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation was willing to know when the Foreign Ministers Conference would hold its next meeting, including China, to jointly deal with the issue of the Japanese peace treaty.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Acheson replied that this was not an issue that should be raised for discussion at present. He said that when the Foreign Ministers Conference was established at the Potsdam Conference, the issue of Japan was not mentioned. Later, the Far Eastern Commission was established, specifically to discuss the issue of Japan. Therefore, the issue of Japan has nothing to do with the Foreign Ministers Conference at all. However, he was still prepared to discuss the issue raised by Vyshinsky at a later stage. As for himself, he was not prepared to discuss the issue of the Japanese peace treaty without instructions or at this current stage. Bevin supported Acheson's opinion, saying that the UK would find it difficult to agree to a Japanese peace conference not attended by New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan, and India. Vyshinsky then said that he did not suggest that this issue must be placed on the agenda of this conference, but felt that seventeen months had passed since the last Foreign Ministers Conference, so it would be worthwhile to check what issues still remained for the next conference to discuss. Vyshinsky also said that China did not participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, or the treaties with Germany and Austria, because these treaties were not directly related to China. As for the Japanese peace treaty, it was undoubtedly of direct interest to China. Chairman Schuman, the French Foreign Minister, believed that Vyshinsky's question should not be resolved at this time. Vyshinsky then agreed with this opinion. The first meeting adjourned after two and a half hours.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd Dispatch] Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky issued a statement today through his spokesman Pavlov, saying that the Soviet delegation was not pessimistic about the outcome of the current Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. When reporters asked when Vyshinsky raised the issue of the Japanese peace treaty at today's meeting, emphasizing that China should be represented in the discussions on the Japanese peace treaty, which Chinese government he was referring to. Pavlov only said that Vyshinsky only referred to China. Pavlov also said that Vyshinsky raised the issue of Japan to show that he was striving for initiative. The four foreign ministers have now agreed to discuss this matter at a later stage in the current conference.</p>
<h3>The Current Foreign Ministers Conference; Will Take About Two Weeks</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd Dispatch] The German newspaper in the US sector claimed: According to people close to the Soviet military government, Marshal Stalin believed that the current Foreign Ministers Conference might last for two weeks. Stalin believed that agreements could be reached quickly on the major issues. The strategy adopted by the Soviet Union at this conference was decided by Stalin and Vyshinsky after five days of secret discussions in the Kremlin.</p>
<h3>The American Occupation Forces in Japan; Appear to Have Long-Term Stationing Intentions; No Concrete Plans to Transfer to Civilian Administration</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] Undersecretary of the Army Voorhees told the House Appropriations Committee today that the Army Department very much wants to end military administration in Japan and transfer to civilian administration, but there are no concrete plans yet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] Testimony released by the House Appropriations Committee on the 23rd revealed that the Army Department hopes that the State Department will immediately take over Japan and Germany. However, a spokesman for the Army Department believes that Japan should not be left unprotected before it can defend itself. Therefore, a considerable number of American troops will remain stationed in Japan for a long time. However, the committee recommended that in many secondary matters, whether industrial or other occupation matters, the guiding personnel should be gradually replaced by Japanese personnel instead of American personnel.</p>
<p>Undersecretary of the Army Voorhees and former Commander of the Eighth Army in Japan, Eichelberger, testified before the Appropriations Committee on the Army's occupation policies and wishes. Voorhees said: "The Army Department has been undertaking the occupation affairs of Japan and Germany for too long." When the Army Department will relinquish responsibility depends on when the State Department or other agencies will be ready to take over.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to the Philippines, Cowen, Presents Credentials to the Philippine President</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 24th Dispatch] The new US Ambassador to the Philippines, Cowen, presented his credentials to President Quirino today. In his address, Cowen stressed that the Philippines is a stabilizing and creative force in resolving Asian issues.</p>
<h3>France and Yugoslavia Sign Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd Dispatch] France and Yugoslavia signed a trade agreement in Paris on the 21st by representatives of the two countries. The agreement stipulates that the two sides will exchange goods worth 12 billion francs each year. France will transport tools and raw materials worth 150 to 200 billion francs to Yugoslavia in five years, and Yugoslavia will export raw materials in exchange. Various economic issues after the signing of the agreement will be resolved in October of this year.</p>
<h3>Ban on Silver Dollar Trading in Beijing</h3>
<p>Must Exchange at Official Rate at the People's Bank</p>
<p>[Nanjing, 20th] In order to clarify the market, stabilize prices, and protect the interests of the broad masses of people and legitimate industry and commerce, the Nanjing Military Control Commission recently issued a proclamation prohibiting the direct buying and selling of silver dollars and the use of silver dollars for paying for goods. The proclamation stipulates: (1) People are allowed to store silver dollars, but they must not directly buy, sell, or use them to pay for goods. (2) To take into account the actual difficulties of people holding silver dollars, they are allowed to exchange them at the People's Bank at the official rate. (3) All silver dollar vendors should automatically switch to other occupations. However, to take care of the few silver dollar vendors who cannot quickly switch occupations, they are allowed to register with the People's Bank, which will issue them transaction permits, temporarily allowing them to conduct transactions in designated areas.</p>
<p>[Nanjing People's Radio Station, 24th broadcast] The Nanjing Branch of the People's Bank of China issued a notice on the 24th stating that the registration of silver dollar vendors in the city will be closed on the 25th. Silver dollar vendors who have not registered should register quickly, and multiple registration points have been added.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Private Banks in Beijing Resume Business</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 20th] Seventeen private banks in Nanjing, including Continental, Shanghai, Jin Cheng, Zhejiang Industrial, Ju Xingcheng, and Zhongnan, resumed business on the 18th. These private banks held a business meeting on the 17th to discuss future business development and other issues based on the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Private Banks and Money Shops in North China People's Government," which was temporarily approved for implementation in the city by the Nanjing Military Control Commission.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Trading Inactive, Silver Dollar Market Conditions Normal</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday's gold market saw very little trading due to a lack of interest from all parties. With supply exceeding demand, the market was unable to rise, and the intraday upper limit was 13.7594 billion, gradually approaching the off-exchange price. Trading is expected to resume today. Due to tight rumors, off-exchange trading was inactive. The morning opening was 13 billion, 16 billion, reaching as high as 15 billion, 18 billion, and the midday closing was 14 billion, 17 billion. In the afternoon, it rose again to 15 billion, 18 billion at the closing, with no significant change compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Off-exchange U.S. dollars followed suit. The morning opening was 27 million, 32 million, reaching as high as 28 million, 33 million, and the midday closing remained at 28 million, 32 million. In the afternoon, there was a slight increase, rising to 30 million, 35 million. Overall trading was light, with little change in the end.</p>
<p>The money exchange industry was sluggish. The morning quotation was 1.3 billion, 1.6 billion, and the afternoon quotation was 1.5 billion, 1.8 billion, with no gains or losses in the end.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold and silver exchange rate was extended by two yuan, with a direct exchange rate rising from 39.42 to 40.43. One type of goods was priced at 39.42, and the other at 41.44. However, the miscellaneous foreign coins were quite popular and shortened by two yuan, falling to 46.48.</p>
<p>The gold and cash exchange rate was stable, remaining at 49 yuan, 51 yuan.</p>
<p>The cash and silver exchange rate increased by two jiao again. The direct exchange rate was 7.7 yuan, 8.2 yuan. One type of goods was priced at 7.5 yuan, 8 yuan, the other type at 7.8 yuan, 8.3 yuan, and miscellaneous foreign coins at 9 yuan, 9.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Some shops selling gold ornaments for silver dollars still mostly suspended trading, with a few quoting 45.50, and transactions were also rare.</p>
<h3>Rice, Oil, and Grains Market Still No Formal Transactions</h3>
<p>Markets Expected to Open as Usual Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, the South Rice Market, Grains Market, and Cooking Oil Market were all closed. It is said that the markets are expected to open as usual today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were a few transactions beside the road in the South Rice Market. The price also weakened due to the decline in the price of gold. White japonica and thin indica rice were 300 million, but there were only sporadic transactions. The prices at rice shops varied, with indica rice around 350 million and white japonica and thin indica rice around 400 million, with slight differences in prices.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: There was a slight amount of trading off-exchange, and the price continued to fall. There was a large surplus of raw rapeseed oil at 64.8 million, a drop of nearly 20%. The asking price for raw soybean oil also fell by about 10%, but there was no formal trading.</p>
<p>Grains: There were a few transactions outside the market on the roadside, and the market situation was roughly the same as the previous day. Mulberry Garden beans were 154.8 million yuan. This was because they were following the price of gold, so they were 20 million weaker. Jiujiang winter beans were 126 million yuan. In addition, the price of lower-grade goods in Pudong Ni Lu was 136.8 million yuan, and vegetable green beans were 172.8 million yuan. The prices all fell.</p>
<p>Flour: The market was flat and weak. However, the rice market has not opened, and the external situation is even more tense. All parties are still watching, and transactions are rare, totaling less than a thousand bags, all of which were minor replenishments from this street. Retail flour shops have been selling very well in recent days, because the flour price has been divorced from the rice price by a considerable margin. Most refugees are accustomed to eating flour, especially No. 4 flour, which is cheap and most popular. Yesterday, the retail price of Lao Che flour without bags was 72 million to 80 million, and Bingchuan flour was around 60 million.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Trading Scarce</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was flat yesterday, and trading remained scarce. The prices of financial goods continued to fall, and coarse and fine yarns uniformly softened. 42-count Blue Phoenix was quoted at 4.95 million, a further decrease of 66,000. The various grades of fine yarn, including 40-count and 32-count, all fell back. The asking price for 21-count Shuangma spot goods seemed slightly higher than the previous day, but acceptance was still low. Yarn of 20 counts and below declined across the board.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth was affected by the stagnation of sales to customers, the lack of business at retail stores, and the trading in the market fell into a state of closure again. As for barter trade, the asking prices were even scarcer than before. The off-market asking prices for Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi serge were similar to the prices of the previous day. Except for Longfeng fine twill and other products of private factories, which fell slightly by 5 million yuan, the rest remained at the original level.</p>
<h3>The Eloquent Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Vyshinsky</h3>
<p>[Special Article by Our Newspaper] Another key figure in the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, has been Molotov's right-hand man since the outbreak of World War II. In March of this year, he succeeded Molotov as Soviet Foreign Minister. Although both Molotov and Vyshinsky are favorites of the Kremlin, they are very different in terms of background and personality. Molotov is an "Old Bolshevik," tempered in the struggle of the revolution. Vyshinsky, on the other hand, grew up in a petty-bourgeois family and received formal academic education. Molotov is serious, cold, and mostly silent, while Vyshinsky likes to talk at length, is eloquent, and is witty and humorous. Therefore, many people say that Vyshinsky is not like a "Soviet-style" diplomat, but more like a Western-style diplomat.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky was born in 1883 in Odessa, Ukraine, and later graduated from the Faculty of Law of Kiev University. In 1902, he joined the Social Democratic Party and began to devote himself to the socialist revolution. In the following years, he engaged in revolutionary propaganda in the Caucasus region and was arrested and imprisoned several times. After the success of the revolution, he practiced law. In 1925, he was hired by Moscow University as a professor of law.</p>
<p>Until then, Vyshinsky was still unknown. Few people in the country knew him, and of course, no one in the international community had heard of his name. Vyshinsky became well-known and his reputation rose during the Soviet purge. At that time, he served as the prosecutor of the purge court. In the process of trying the Trotskyites and traitors, his amazing eloquence, meticulous thinking, and decisive decision-making were fully demonstrated, which laid the foundation for his political status in the country. In 1938, he was elected Vice Chairman of the People's Committee and later served as Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He served as the representative of the Soviet Union at every session of the United Nations General Assembly. In the meeting place, he often argued with the representatives of Western countries until he was red in the face. Once, he directly accused the American representative Dulles of being a "warmonger," which made the two unhappy and parted ways.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky's eloquence is admired by everyone who has heard his grand theory. At the last United Nations General Assembly, he debated with representatives from Britain, the United States, and Australia, fighting against many opponents with clear reasoning and forceful words, making the representatives feel that they "had to believe" him.</p>
<p>Last year, in a diplomatic setting, he once said: "I believe I will not see war again in my life," but then he added, "But please do not forget that I am already sixty-four years old!" These two sentences were humorous and painful. Will there be another world war in these twenty years? No one can predict. However, the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference obviously has a decisive impact on whether mankind can avoid foolish war in the near future.</p>
<h3>Symposium Held in Beijing</h3>
<p>Discussing Cultural and Scientific Construction Work</p>
<p>[Xinhua Radio Station, Beiping, 24th broadcast] Nanjing News: In order to carry out the cultural and scientific construction work in Nanjing, the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army in Nanjing, and the Nanjing Municipal People's Government jointly invited people from the cultural, educational, and scientific circles to hold a symposium at 4:00 PM on the 16th. More than 40 people, including Liang Xi, Tao Menghe, Wu Yifang, and Xu Jie, attended. Liu Bocheng, Deputy Director of the Military Control Commission, Song Renqiong, Deputy Mayor Ke Qingshi, and Zhang Linzhi also attended the meeting. At the meeting, Director Liu Bocheng said: The old China has been broken, and the task of building a new China is arduous, but its future is bright. We must follow the principles of new democracy to transform China from an agricultural country into an industrial country. Therefore, natural science is extremely important, and I hope that everyone will work hard. Tao Menghe, Liang Xi, Wu Han and others also spoke.</p>
<h3>Curtain Falls on the Three-Power Football Tournament:</h3>
<p>Tung Wah, Ching Pak Drawn Yesterday: Tung Wah Wins Championship with One Win, One Draw; Ching Pak Second, Railways Third</p>
<p>The final act of the Three-Power Football Invitational Tournament, the Tung Wah vs. Ching Pak match, took place at the Yiyuan Stadium yesterday afternoon starting at 3:30 PM. More than 8,000 spectators attended, making it a grand occasion. Both teams fielded their best players in an effort to secure a glorious victory, resulting in a series of wonderful moments. In the end, neither side scored, ending the match with a 0-0 draw. Tung Wah achieved the great feat of one win and one draw, winning the championship. Ching Pak finished second with a draw, and Railways finished third with one draw and one loss. The lineups of the Tung Wah and Ching Pak teams are listed below:</p>
<p>Tung Wah</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Xie Xichuan Zhang Linggen</p>
<p>Hannibal Wu Qixiang Chen Lianglian</p>
<p>Li Yao Gao Xiuqing Han Longhai Qian Mingzhe Chen Mingzhe Jin Lusheng</p>
<p>Ching Pak</p>
<p>Huang Shijie</p>
<p>Qiang Yuanzhi Zhang Renyi Yan Shixin Meng Yiliang Jiang Qing Fu Naitang</p>
<p>Luo Shoufu Liu Longxin Gu Yi Liu Tiyin Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Referee Fang Rongfu, linesmen Zang Wenbin, Xu Guoliang, took the field to officiate. Tung Wah chose the position, and Ching Pak kicked off. Liu Longxin advanced rapidly, and Tung Wah fully protected. Zhang Banglun rushed forward and caught the ball. Tung Wah adopted an offensive, and Han Longhai's near-goal shot went slightly wide. Ching Pak refused to be outdone and launched a collective attack. Luo Shoufu penetrated twice, but Wu Qixiang cleared the encirclement. Ching Pak still did not relax, and Liu Tiyin crossed from the sideline. Liu Longxin headed the ball, but Jin Lusheng's wild kick narrowly missed the goalpost. In the 17th minute, Tung Wah advanced with its entire team. Jiang Qing hurriedly blocked the corner kick. Li Yao took the kick, lobbing the ball to the center. Chen Lianglian jumped up and headed the ball, but Huang Shijie failed to catch it, and the ball went out of bounds. After that, Ching Pak's momentum was strong, and Liu Longxin and Luo Shoufu each had a great chance, but they did not succeed. After that, there were back-and-forth plays, with many wonderful moments. The first half ended in a 0-0 draw.</p>
<p>After switching sides, Ching Pak replaced Gu Yi with Liu Tiyin, and Tung Wah kept its original team. Tung Wah attacked, and Hannibal blocked Gu Yi's ball. He passed the ball to Gao Xiuqing, and Longhai broke through the center. Fortunately, Yan Shixin arrived in time to avoid the danger. In the 7th minute, Ching Pak finally turned the tide. Luo Shoufu launched a surprise attack, and Wu Qixiang made a desperate slide to clear the ball. Three minutes later, Tung Wah's Chen Mingzhe made a quick cross along the side, and Gao Xiuqing intentionally passed the ball to Li Yao, who made a bold rush towards the goal, but the ball was narrowly wide. Tung Wah continued to work hard, and from then on, Ching Pak's hinterland was filled with dangers. Meng Yiliang responded effectively, defusing the dangers several times. In the 18th minute, Ching Pak, after a long period of inactivity, prepared to make an attack. Jin Lusheng crossed the ball to the center, and Fei Chunhua received the ball and passed it to the left. Jin Lusheng made a diagonal shot at the 15-yard mark, which was fast and tricky, but unfortunately hit Zhang Banglun's arm, resulting in a corner kick. Jin kicked the corner kick, and Zhang Linggen sent the ball to the front line. In the 28th minute, Yan Shixin rested and was replaced by Qiang Yuanzhi. Ching Pak's Luo Shoufu penetrated deep on his own, and Wu Qixiang accidentally handled the ball, resulting in a free kick, which was taken by Meng Yiliang, but he was too hasty. Not long after, Tung Wah's Chen Mingzhe dribbled into the hinterland, and Qiang Yuanzhi committed a foul in defense, resulting in a free kick, which was taken by Wu Qixiang, but it went too high. The statutory time had arrived, and neither side had scored, so they shook hands and made peace. Tung Wah achieved one win and one draw, winning the championship in the three-power tournament.</p>
<h3>Second Division Table Tennis League: Three Matches Today</h3>
<p>Starting Today, Change to 5:00 PM</p>
<p>The Fourth Table Tennis League continues today (the 25th) with three matches in the Second Division, held in the Kinmen, Post Office, and China Agricultural Bank table tennis rooms. In Second Division One, the undefeated champion Haiguang will play against Lulian. The latter has lost all four matches and may be wiped out in this match. In Second Division Two, Duxin Yi meets the Post Office 18. Both teams have lost their momentum and have lost their chances of being selected. Their skills are similar, so there will be a fierce battle. In another match, Youlian will play against China Agricultural Bank. The former has only lost once and still has hope. China Agricultural Bank's strength is mediocre and will not be a match for Youlian. The organizer announced that starting today, all match times within this week, except for Sundays, will be changed to 5:00 PM. It is hoped that all duty teams will cooperate to facilitate the event. The schedule for today and the results of previous matches are listed below:</p>

<h3>Refugees from Suburbs Flood into the City: Temporary Relief Committee Actively Engages in Work; Nearly 10,000 People Currently Housed</h3>
<p>[Special Report by Our Newspaper] Since the city entered a state of war, various charitable organizations, in view of the urgent need for wartime relief work, jointly formed the "Shanghai Temporary Joint Relief Committee" on the 25th of last month. The committee consists of the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, the Catholic Church, the Christian Church, the YMCA, the Children's Welfare Society, the Buddhist Association, the Renji Hall, the Tongren Fuyuantang, and other organizations. It was not until recently that the chairman of the committee, Yan Huiqing, officially announced its establishment. With the war intensifying, refugees from the suburbs have been flooding into the city, and the committee's work has suddenly become busy, with relief efforts actively underway. Yesterday, reporters visited the committee's office, located in the Renji Shanzhuang at No. 35 Yunnan Middle Road, and were told the details as follows:</p>
<p>Several Young Men and Women Apply to Join the Work</p>
<p>The committee is currently responsible for promoting the work through the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee has one chairman, Yan Huiqing, and four vice-chairmen: former Minister of Finance Li Sihao, charitable figure Dong Hanzhi, former Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan, and Kuai Yanfang of the Siming Public Hall. Yan himself is unable to participate in the actual work due to illness at Zhongshan Hospital, so Li Sihao is currently responsible for most of the committee's main administration. Other members of the Standing Committee include Zhu Kongjia, Xu Yongzuo, Lu Meiseng, Lu Ganchen, Xu Guomao, Hong Nianzhi, Shou Jingwei, An Qing, Zeng Fu, Hong Shihao, Sun Yongyi, Yan E'sheng, Yan Fuqing, Zhu Heng, and Zhu Huaiping. The Standing Committee meets every Wednesday and Saturday to jointly plan the relief work. As for all the committee's actual affairs, they are handled by the general secretary Zhao Puchu and deputy general secretary Li Wenjie. There are subordinate groups for general affairs, supplies, accommodation, children, burial, and repatriation, which assist each other. In addition to providing lunch to the staff, all are volunteer positions and are deployed by the participating organizations. Yesterday, the reporter saw several young men and women automatically applying to join the work, which shows that there are still enthusiastic people in society. The committee temporarily declined, as there is no need for them at present.</p>
<p>In addition to Relieving Refugees, It Also Plans to Rescue the Sick and Wounded</p>
<p>The main task of the committee, in addition to relieving refugees, is to engage in the rescue of the sick and wounded when necessary. Due to the limitations of manpower and resources, all actual work is, in principle, handled by the participating organizations themselves, and the committee stands in a guiding position to assist them. For example, the Renji Hall has now accommodated more than 200 refugees who have fled from the Dachang area. Also, the orphanage, monastery, and observatory established by the Catholic Church in Xujiahui have also accommodated 3,200 refugees. The vegetable market at No. 16 Pu also accommodates more than 2,000 people. There are currently nine refugee shelters of this type, which are handled by various organizations themselves and assisted by the committee. They are scattered throughout the city and currently accommodate nearly 10,000 people, and the number is increasing daily.</p>
<p>The committee's source of funds, in addition to the Ministry of the Interior allocating 2,700 bags of rice and 1,000 bags of flour from the materials stored in Shanghai, as well as more than 500 bundles of old clothes for relief, also includes donations from the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund of rice, milk powder, cod liver oil, and methicillin, totaling hundreds of tons, and 900 bags of cotton yarn donated by the Joint Distribution Agency. The reporter asked whether the committee could obtain any assistance from the International Red Cross, which was recently reported to be planning to carry out relief work in the city. The answer was: The committee has not yet had any contact with the International Red Cross.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic People Donate Cash and Goods</p>
<p>In recent days, the war has become increasingly urgent, and the number of refugees has increased sharply. Yesterday, it was learned that there were thousands of refugees in Pudong who could not cross the river. Upon hearing the news, the committee immediately allocated flour and urgently asked the Pudong Fellow Association to find a way to make steamed buns and send them over. Currently, the committee is deeply worried about the limited resources, while the number of refugees continues to increase. If this continues, it is feared that it will be unable to sustain itself. Therefore, it is hoped that enthusiastic people in society can act in the spirit of helping others as they would help themselves, work together in the same boat, and jointly find a solution. Donations, whether cash or in kind, are welcome. If people in society have vacant houses that can accommodate 30 to 50 people and are willing to accommodate refugees, the committee is also willing to provide the necessary materials and provide assistance at any time.</p>

<h3>Legal Clarifications</h3>
<p>[Mr. He Zhicheng asked] (1) After I formally married Miss So-and-so in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), I was working outside and the economy was difficult, so I had my wife stay with my in-laws. Unexpectedly, a sudden change occurred last year, and she ran away with all the clothes and ornaments in the house. I asked for leave and returned to my hometown to negotiate with my in-laws. The mother of the girl asked two relatives and friends to mediate. The mother of the girl admitted that her daughter had run away with the money and belongings and was willing to act as her full representative in public. It was decided to draw up a contract to terminate the relationship between husband and wife, and both parties each held a copy, stating that after the contract was signed, the man and woman would be free to marry or remarry, and both parties would publish a statement in the newspaper at the same time. There has been no response for several months. I don't know if it is legally effective. (2) If a friend introduces me to Miss So-and-so in the future, can I marry her? (3) If the runaway wife finds out after the marriage, can she sue her husband for abandonment and bigamy? (4) What kind of procedures should be followed to resolve the matter permanently?</p>
<p>[Answer] (1) If a husband and wife both agree to a divorce, it should be done in writing and should have the signatures of two or more witnesses. According to the situation described in the letter, the divorce should be supplemented by the wife's signature to be legally effective. (2) You can remarry after the divorce. (3) In fact, I don't think there will be any problems. (4) Follow the answer method in the first item.</p>
<p>[Mr. Wang Yiqian asked] When my father was alive, he rented the house where we lived to a Mr. Shao, a businessman, because our family was leaving Shanghai. The two parties agreed on a term of seven years, and there are still two years left, and a contract was signed, stipulating that it could not be sublet to others. After my father passed away, the tenant moved to another place. Because the term of our house had not expired, we were willing to keep it empty and refused to return it. Now our family has returned to Shanghai from another port and requested to move back, but permission was not granted. Now I suddenly heard that Mr. Shao had a relative move in. After blocking it, it was ineffective. Now I have a few questions and ask for answers. (1) Is their action legal without our consent? (2) If it cannot be resolved, can we sue them in court? (3) If the term has not expired and they do not live in it, can we ask them to move out? (4) Are the litigation costs affordable for ordinary people?</p>
<p>[Answer] (1) Since the lease contains a provision that subletting is not allowed, the lessee subletting the house to others without the lessor's consent is a violation of the lease. (2) You can sue them in court. (3) If the lessee closes the house and does not use it for six months, the term of the lease has not expired, you can request to terminate the lease. (4) The litigation costs are standardized by the court.</p>
