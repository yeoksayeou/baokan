<h3>大學教授國策研究會　提具體和平綱領　盼國共雙方能共同接納　並發起組織和平策進會洽商和談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕中國各大學教授國策研究會，前發表江電響應總統文告，向中共呼籲和平，建議召開新政協，組織聯合政府，該會頃再發起聯絡國共以外之黨派及社會領袖，組織「和平策進會」，分向國共雙方洽商和談，並提出較具體之和平綱領，盼雙方犧牲黨派利益，共同接總。該會所擬之和平綱領如次。甲，和平談判之步驟：（一）國共雙方立卽停戰，所有各戰塲軍隊各於原陣地後退若干里，未參戰者止於原防。（二）國共雙方立卽停止一切宣傳戰，雙方同時釋放政治犯，開放言禁。（三）國共雙方各派全權代表，幷與第三方面組織新的政治協商會議，請友邦調停。（四）新政協之構成分十，爲國民黨·共產黨·中間黨派·民意機關·人民團體。社會領袖六方面各六人，成「六六比例制」，調人則請美·蘇·英·法四使祖任之。（五）新政協之開會地點，定於上海。乙·協商會議之方式：（一）新政協之表決方式，關於程序問題者，應由出席人二分之一以上爲之，關於決議者，應由出席人三分之二以上爲之，如不能達成決議時，得由調人仲裁。（二）所有會議經過及爭點，應逐日公布，俾便接受輿論與民衆之批評。丙。聯合政府之體制：（一）成立臨時聯合政府，採委員制，其構成份子仍用新政協之「六六比例制」，卽黨派份子佔一半，招黨派之人民代表佔一半，（因全國各黨派之黨員數，恐不及全民百分之一，臨時政府爲遷就事實始各佔一半），其主席由社會領袖担任，副主席二人由國共分任之、（二）聯合政府另訂一臨時政府組織法，及和談後共同施行綱領。（三）在雙方交戰區，劃出緩衝地帶，由社會領袖負責處理地方行政，直接受聯合政府之統馭。（四）實行軍隊國家化，國防軍之長官士兵一律不許有黨籍，現役軍人不得兼文職。（五）各黨派互循民主之方式，作政治競賽，至臨時政府維持一年時，卽展開普選運動，成立新民意機構。（六）由新民意機構決定憲法之存廢或修改，再依據憲法產生正式政府。</p>
<h3>英檢察官卡淾　論中共政策</h3>
<p>比擬麥帥在日政策</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十二日電〕遠東國際戰犯法庭英檢察官卡爾，十二日將中共政策比之於麥克阿瑟元帥在日本之政策。渠告皇家帝國協會稱：「據採集現居中共區域內歐洲人士之記錄，以及中共布告之原文視之，中國共產黨原係農田改革之黨派。彼等之農田新法律，大體上似不較日本境內在麥帥壓力下施行者更爲激烈。二者均不通爲將現有業巳開墾之地田重新分配於耕種人之計劃，耕種人包括現田主在內」。卡氏稱，渠並無抨擊「麥帥卓越功績」之意，僅在鄭重指出，麥帥之政策可爲對抗共產主義之最有效措置之良鑑。</p>

<h3>對我國所提秘密照會　美英均考慮答覆　蘇聯緘默法待巴黎決定　樸資茅斯市長願以該城爲議和地點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十三日廣播：中國駐美大使顧維鈞稱，渠曾與美代理國務卿羅維特商討中國和平問題。顧氏稱，中國政府將繼續採取和平政策，直至獲得成功時爲止。事實證明共黨對中國民衆蔪求和平之情緒，漠不關懷。關於蔣總統可能前往合灣之傳說，顧氏拒不表示意見。渠拒絕證實或否認渠曾自美國致府接獲任何通知。倫敦方面傳說英。美政府刻正老慮答復中國之調停請求。顧氏謂，中國政府認爲大局之發展，不僅與中國關係重大，且與全世界之和平休戚相關。渠稱，中國政府現正多方尋求和平之途徑。記者詢渠曾否將其政府之任何文書送達美政府，　答「未曾」。但謂，僅與羅維特商談中國一般局勢。顧氏最後稱。中國政府徇人民之期望，已明白表示其恢復中國和平之　望，所提出之和平建議，在蔣總統之元且文告及孫科最近之聲明中，均已有明白表示。</p>

<h3>展望東南亞洲會議</h3>
<p>東南亞的危機，因荷印衝突的死灰復燃而益　惡化了。誰都不能否認，帝國主義與共產主義，在東南亞各國人民的眼中看來，無異於「苛政」與「猛虎」，假如不讓他們共謀自衛自救之道，而迫着他們要在二者之中抉擇其一，則在「苛政猛於虎」的情形之下，東南亞局勢的歸趨，自然不言可知的了。</p>
<p>印度領袖尼赫魯旣憤於荷蘭在印尼的暴行，同時又爲挽救東南亞的危機起見，特向亞洲十四國呼籲，各派代表至新德里舉行東南亞洲國際會議，討論荷蘭侵略印尼後所引起之新局勢。這一建議不特爲亞洲東用各國所一致贊成，而且也引起了英美各國的重視。莫不認爲此一會議足以輔助聯合國解決荷印爭議；同時，區域安全機構亦可由此誕生。故美國政論家路易費許氏要求美國政府亦派一「同情的觀察家」前往參加，並認爲此一會議對於荷印爭議必能採取「有效行動」。</p>
<p>東南亞洲會議本定於十六日召開，後因籌備不及，延至二十日，屆時必能如期開幕，殆無疑義。我們重視這次會議的意義，願在開幕的前夕，提出若干意見，以供亞洲各國以及其他有關各國當局的參考。</p>
<p>第一，亞洲人口佔世界人口之半數，面積佔全球三分之一，僅以此二端而論，在人民世紀的今日，亞洲在國際上實估重要地位，是不容任何人忽視的。在過去，亞洲各國均因政治經濟的落後，大半淪爲歐美工業先進國的殖民地，任人剝削，聽人宰割而不自覺：但至今日，亞洲人民受了大時代的潮流的激盪，早巳澈底覺醒了。在政治上固要求獨立自由：在經濟上亦要求自由與乎等，第二次大戰後亞洲各國的擾攘不安，都是含有深刻意義的民族運動。印度緬甸的獨立，固然是如此，越南印尼的努力，亦莫不是如此。所以我們要求世界各國對於亞洲各團，千萬不可再以過去的陳舊觀念——殖民地視之，否則處理任何爭議，必致徒增亂源，使亞洲局勢益趨惡化。</p>
<p>第二，亞洲人民目前所面臨的危機，一是共產主義勢力的潛入，有如水銀瀉地無孔不入，使亞洲各國莫不受其威脅；另是帝國主義勢力的根深蒂固，越南印尼人民所受的痛苦，最深亦最大，在「苛政猛於虎」的原則之下，使大多數的人民自然只有更左傾了。倫敦泰晤士報十日社評，猶稱東南亞的民族運動將爲莫斯科所利用，這種論調，決非我亞洲人民所能接受。姑以最近荷蘭侵略印尼事件而論，荷蘭在印尼不惜達背停戰協定，直接採取軍事行動，以海陸空三軍猛攻印尼首都日惹，實將帝國主義的面目暴露無遺，以言美國對於荷印爭議，始終沒有「堅定不移」的立塲，今日美國代表雖然也聲色供厲地譴責荷蘭侵略印尼，但仍有人懷疑美國在暗中支持荷蘭在印尼的行動，我們希望新任國務卿艾契遜速取賢明對策，以澄淸世界的興情。</p>
<p>第三，今日亞洲爲自衛自救計，的確需要有一個區域安全機構，促進亞洲各地人民互相諒解與合作，共謀亞洲的安定與繁榮。但這種機構必須由亞洲人民自己出來組織之。去年十二月間英澳所倡議的「東方聯盟」，亞洲人民不能不抱保留態度。首先要明瞭這「東方聯盟」的主人，究底是亞洲各國，抑或是在亞洲之外的英美各國。所以我們站在亞洲人民的立塲，與其等待外人出來領導組織「東方聯盟」，母寗在新德里會議中自動組織一「亞洲聯盟」。</p>
<p>要之，亞洲世紀的來臨，像時代的洪流一樣，是不可抗力的，新德里會議的呼聲，就是亞洲世紀來臨的先聲，亞洲人民的覺醒與團結，使世界各國不能不「括目相見」，除非世界上尚有執迷不悟的帝國中義，否則今日決不會再以殖民地看待亞洲了。</p>
<h3>霍夫曼譴責蘇聯　對攝取全中國已極接近　並指我憑武力剿共爲基本錯誤</h3>
<p>〔中央社底特律十二日合衆電〕經合總署署長霍夫曼，頃於此聲稱：蘇聯政治局正竭盡力量，以圖達到世界統治。據稱：此次環球旅行觀察所得，已獲絕對信念，蓋蘇聯政策及運動之第一目的，正以强力與決心進行中，希特勒當年之努力與之相較，亦見失色。禮氏聲明係預先草就，向此間汽車工程師協會發表，且爲美方負責官員譴責蘇聯之最猛烈者。霍氏認爲，最近美國內國外共產黨活動雖告揭露，然美國人民仍不悉目前所發生者爲何，且對威脅本身及全世界危機之嚴重性皆無所知。氏繼謂：蘇聯殘忍無道，而其政策實施時之狡黠巧妙，則唯馬凱凡里（十五世紀陰謀政治家）可與倫比，據謂：蘇聯政府之大夢，爲加强克里姆林控制之衛星國，而建立世界獨裁。氏列舉蘇聯自日本投降以來之種種成就，並謂：史達林對是項結果，誠堪沾沾自喜，在攫取歐洲數國之外，克里姆林對攫取全部中國已極爲接近，中國局勢至爲嚴重。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十二日廣播：霍夫曼在汽車工程師會議中發表演說稱：共產黨除控制若干歐洲國家外，更將控制全中國，致局勢己趨極端嚴重。霍氏謂：中國政府剿共戰爭之基本錯誤，乃誤信僅憑武力可以打倒共產主義。中國各省之努力，大都側重於軍事方面，各省領袖咸集中其人力物力，希圖以武力遏阻共產主義，對於改善人民生活，則幾一無建樹，因此，造成悲慘之結局。但霍氏特別提出山西省主席閻錫山對大局獨能眞知灼見，別具卓識。霍氏追述閻氏曾著有「對付共產黨的方法」小册子，該書謂除非民氣旺路，戰爭難操勝算。霍氏旋引述該書中若干主張，如消除階級分野，組織民衆團體，討論政府目標，不分貧富，實施食糧配給制，以求經濟上之平等，實行農村改革之民兵制等等。</p>

<h3>國防部發表一週戰局　－自一月六日至十二日－</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕國防部頃發表自一月六日至十二日一週戰局，全文如次：</p>
<p>在全國一致企求和平之際，不料共匪最近竟以主力決戰之軍事行動，猛犯天津和永宿地區，好像他們這種行動，乃是非正式的答覆全國人民對和平的呼籲，國軍將士在能戰能和而不避戰求和的決策指導下，咸能忠義奮發，與匪搏鬥，予匪重大打擊。茲將各戰塲情况概述於左：</p>
<p>（一）杜聿明兵團苦戰突團杜聿明副總司令，自從十一月六日由東北經過南京轉赴徐州以後，卽指揮邱淸泉，孫元良，李彌三兵團，與優勢之陳毅匪主力連續作戰，作戰期間已兩個月零六天，最初一月，在徐州附近與匪激戰十數次，曾擊破匪將近十個縱隊，從未休息整補，後奉命由徐州南調，阻止陳毅，劉伯承二匪的合力南進。於十二月初到達永城宿縣中間地區，與匪開始主力作戰，經過一月之惡戰苦鬥，除孫元良全團一都早已突圍外，邱李兩兵團月來均在陳官莊，靑龍集一帶狹小地區，被優勢之匪圍攻，全靠空運補給，其間十天遭遇風雨冰雪之縣劣天侯，官兵糧食燃料補給不濟，饑寒交迫，在悲痛情緒下，賴殺戰馬充　，駐地已無樹皮草根，杜副總司令和邱，李司令官高級將領，仍都與士卒同甘苦，共患難，常竟日不得半飽，杜副總司令且於半月前卽臥病，國防部兩次派飛機接他就醫，他均以願留與所部共患難爲辭，不肯出來。直到本月六日淸晨，陳匪集結新經補充之第一，二，三，四，八，九，十，十三，兩廣，魯中南，快速及渤海等十五個縱隊，和另外三個獨立旅，以及由鄭州，開封，濟南開來的民兵，總數約有卅萬人，傾巢進犯。我杜部官兵協同空軍與匪浴血奮戰，連續五天，戰况激烈空前，在此期內，匪軍死傷於國軍還擊及飛機炸射奢達五萬餘名，國軍傷亡亦達三萬餘人，以主要陣地盡成焦土，我杜副總司令率部於十日晨向外突圍，由於匪軍在四週曾掘五道以上之長壕，並滿佈地雷及排砲，突圍部隊犧牲損失，自在意中，刻尚有隊伍數部，向西向南行進戰鬥途中，總計一個月以來，我杜兵團奉命固守　永地區，以一個月的時間，牽制匪軍之南進，杜兵團於超過限期五天之後，才開始突圍，在戰略上已完成其爭取時間，掩護江淮國軍佈署任務，幷取得傷斃匪十萬以上的代價，全軍堅苦作戰壯烈犧性之英勇事蹟，堪爲國軍之模範。　江淮方面，蘇北各地因國軍之加强部署，甚爲平靜，津浦南段國軍，週來主動出擊，掃蕩鐵路兩側之土共，匪重要據點古城鐵（來安城北約七十華里），藕塘鎭（定遠以東）均經國軍於六日一舉攻克，匪兩淮獨立旅卅四旅及粟裕，孫傳嘉等匪部被擊後，負創逃竄，現津浦南段鐵路兩側各四十華里以內，已無匪踪。</p>
<p>（二）天津國軍連戰獲捷天津方面，在天津週邊地區劇戰，自六日起展開，林彪匪主力七個縱隊全綫猛攻，林匪約七·八兩縱隊由灰堆犯天津市東南部，九縱隊犯正南，一·二兩縱隊攻津西，三縱隊及第二獨立旅攻津北，戰事以東西兩面最爲激烈，自六日起迄十日止，血戰五晝夜，我擊破匪第七縱隊十九師，廿一師及第八縱隊廿二師，第二縱隊的第四·第六師，第一縱隊的一個師，斃傷匪二萬一千餘人，我軍僅有五個營損失較重，傷亡不到三千人。匪雖數度衝至城防工事附近，但由於我軍奮勇向匪衝擊，各戰塲均能以少勝衆，故匪之攻勢均被遏止。刻國軍將士正以勝利情緒，堅定信心，沉着向匪反擊。匪在屢攻屢挫之餘，傷亡慘重，只好分向東北西三面後撤，從事整頓，幷由北平附近抽四·五蹤隊增援，刻津市外圍　地仍屹立無恙。</p>
<p>塘大方面，連日情况無變化，國軍搜剿部隊在外圍不斷與匪發生接觸，新海北塘兩地，仍由國軍固守中。</p>
<p>總計天津近郊之戰，國軍已表現愈戰愈勇之精神，自昨日起，戰事稍停，預料匪在補充增援後，仍必再犯，屆時國軍當再予以沉重之打擊·</p>
<p>北平方面，自上週起，北平四週的林彪匪部，卽紛紛東調，圍攻天津，仍留平郊之林匪爲十一縱隊及六縱隊一部，其餘則爲新自平綏，平漢沿綫竄來之聶榮臻匪部第一·二·三·四·六·七等六個縱隊，北平四郊週來僅有零星戰鬥，除匪我砲兵不時互轟外，國軍對小股匪軍之竄擾，均隨時加以逐退。</p>

<h3>艾契遜列席參院外委會　說明外交政策觀點　並答覆渠與希斯等關係的種種質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛顿十三日廣播：參院外交委會今日集會，討論艾契遜被提名爲國務卿一事，艾氏特蒞會答覆詢問。各委員詢問艾氏之問題，集中於艾氏經歷，艾氏與近被最高法院以僞證罪起訴之前國務院官員希斯之關係，及艾氏主持之法律事務所與波闌政府之關係·艾氏當稱，彼與希斯爲同僚，爲朋友，但希斯並非其助手。並稱，「希斯之第端納，希斯則爲余之助理，端納服務國家，頗見忠勤，至今仍爲予所主持法律事務听中之助理。並謂其事務所已早與波政府斷絕關係。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕杜魯門總統任命之新國務卿艾契遜，今日出席參院外委會，答覆關於渠贊成對蘇採「溫和」政策之傳說。艾氏似確信渠必能辦得該委會甚至參院之信任票。</p>
<p>委會主席康納萊稱，艾契遜將獲得答覆外界種種流言之機會，諸如艾氏對外交政策之觀點，他和希斯（被控曾竊取戰時國務院機密文件以供給蘇問諜團的前國議員官員）的關係，以及他的法律事務所與波蘭共黨政府的業務關係等。共和黨幾員私下承認，十二日晚來自前助理國務卿裴爾之電報，巳將渠等之計劃摧毀。裴爾曾一度反對艾契遜的對蘇「友好」政策，但　致電外委會稱，渠相信艾氏之見解，在過去四年中已顯著改變，渠促請國會加速批准艾氏任命，裴爾本人可能出席作證。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕美國務院澈底改組計劃，已由胡佛委員會草擬完成，按照地理分配，將在國務院中設置遠東·近東·歐洲·非洲·及拉丁美洲五位助理。新任國務卿艾絜遜亦曾參加此項起草工作。委員會報告書中之建議，大部份係根據一年前國務院助理貝理福起草之方案。原案因國務卿馬歇爾及劃卿羅維特，忙於應付外交問題，無暇進行改組計劃，致未通過。貝氏係艾契遜至友，國務卿於本月二十日就職後，貝氏仍將留任。提議改組中之要點，卽不按工作種類，而按國別及區域劃分國務院之工作。在新制度下，遠東司之工作得包括國務院中關於遠東方面之政策·經濟·情報及公共事務在內。</p>
<h3>美國防部長要求授權　派軍事團赴國外　駐華顧問團可長期成立</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕國防部長福萊斯特今日向參院軍委會提出計劃，要求准許派造軍事代表國前往世界各地，以促進美國之環球利益。代表團分爲三種：（一）一般軍事援助性質；（二）美洲國際合作性質，事實上等於軍事援助美洲各國；（三）授權各代表團制定環球利益之方案。按軍事代表團計劃，爲福氏一連串國防計劃之一，其他計劃將陸續提出。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日電〕福萊特計劃一經批准，則駐華美軍顧問團可以長期成立。按派遣美軍顧問團前往中國之擢衡，係按戰時總統之緊急法權授予總統者，但自緊急法宣告終止後，此項權力卽告取消。</p>
<h3>美大空軍計劃</h3>
<p>政府內部意見尚有歧異</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十二日電〕美空軍界與國會人士稱，杜魯門總統致國會之咨文，雖欲將空軍實力减爲四十八戰鬥隊，但國會或將決定增至七十隊。目前美空軍共有六十隊，其中一隊之飛機現用於柏林之空運接濟。又稱，杜魯門與空軍領袖意見之歧異，不特關於實力方面，抑且關於政策方面，因空軍領袖主張美對蘇應取堅決政策，而杜魯門與其顧問則恐空軍增至七十隊，將爲蘇領袖認爲威脅蘇聯之安全。接近空軍之各界以爲如杜魯門拒絕將空軍增至七十隊，則空軍領袖將注重空軍實力於長距離之軍轟炸機，而不注電戰鬥與輕轟炸機，因重轟炸機能載巨量炸彈飛行一千公里之遙也。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統　突訪馬歇爾</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕杜魯門十二日突離白宮，乘坐「露點」號飛往北加羅里納州，探視正在休養中之馬歇爾，當晚返此。此次出人意外之訪問，事前未經宣布。總統往訪時，馬　適在午睡，據稱，此行純係私人拜訪</p>
<h3>愛內斯坦痊可　對記者談和平</h3>
<p>對聯合國頗多指摘</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十三日電〕著名科學家愛因斯圯因腹部開刀，投入此間布洛克林醫院，預定今日出院。據其向記者發表談話稱，「東西雙方互相敵視，殊無理由可言。目前人類所需要者乃眞摯希望積極合作，而非危險的讀武心理。旣無追求世界和平之決心，當然亦無覓得該種和平之方法。聯合國迄今未能解決巴勒斯坦問題，巳因而降低其威信，若與權力政治貿然妥協必將削弱其在世界之精神立塲。聯合國機構遲不准許以色列入會致使本身聲望大受損害，其故亦卽在此」。愛氏現年六十九歲，以研究原子分裂及發明相對論馳譽世界。</p>
<h3>覓取聖地永久和平　羅特島談判開始　以色列電告軍隊已復員</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅特島亞爾多福特十三日電〕當以色列與埃及代表準備於此間舉行會議以覓取和平之時，來自台拉維夫之電訊稱，猶軍已開始復負。此一可能解決全部巴勒斯坦戰爭的歷史性會議，預定於十三日上午十一時假特露斯飯店樓下會議室開始，會談將在聯合國調解員彭契之主持下進行，彭契稱，會談之前途「非常樂觀。</p>
<p>台拉維夫一般情緒，均認爲巴勒斯坦戰事業已結束，軍隊復員及恢復國家之平時經濟已爲其時。當羅特島會談開始之時，一般形勢均對以色列有利。猶軍在事實上已佔有全部尼基夫沙漠區，埃軍一旅團仍被團於尼基夫北部之法魯伽，埃軍仍被逼於狹長之海岸地帶，包括主要據點格茲在內。抵達此間之埃代表團十人完全係軍人，由艾第上校率領，顯示埃及僅認爲目前之談判，係關於尼基夫區局勢，而並非一般之政治解決。另一方面，以色列代表團共六人，大部係政治人物由外交司長伊丹任團長，顯示猶方關切一般的政治解決，俾可能達成永久和平階段。</p>
<h3>開羅發生爆炸案</h3>
<p>〔聯合社開羅十三日電〕一炸彈藏於公事皮包內，十三日在此間爆發，炸斃二人，傷廿二人，此間城中心附近之克拉克廣塲亦遭受若干損害。此一爆炸顯然謀在燬掉關於回教兄弟會所發動暴行之檔案，當時幸有一警局之茶房疑心此公事皮包之重量，致未造成慘案，否則高等法庭及政府辦公室兩大樓亦將部份被炸燬。</p>

<h3>安理會對印尼問題　今將提出新議案　調節委員將會晤被扣印尼領袖</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖十二日電〕安理會主席加拿大代表麥克勞頓今日稱：安理會將於十四日繼續考慮印尼問題，屈時將就安理會應取之行動提出議案。　美代表傑塞普十二日在安理會中發表强有力之聲明，列舉各項解決印荷爭執之可能採取之積極步驟。安理會現已獲得足够數量之建議，以作厘定議案之用。中國與挪威亦提出同樣建議。麥克勞頓盼此三項建議能合併成一明確之安理會行動之計劃。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十二日電〕安理會古巴代表將於星期五提出印尼問題之建議草案，該建議大旨乃依美代表傑塞普星期二所主之熊度而擬成。據聯合國觀察家意見，美國之立塲等於接受荷籣警備行動所造成之「現局」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社已建維亞十三日電〕調解委會代表將於十五日赴邦加島訪問爲荷蘭監禁於該地之印尼總理哈泰及其他兩領袖。在訪問後，調解委會將向安理會提出報告書。又聞調解委會在下周內，並將赴蘇門答臘北部普拉潑，以便與被監禁以該　之印尼總統蘇卡諾及外長沙里姍及前總理沙利等人會晤。行前將會晤季里諾總統</p>

<h3>法共領袖演說　美蘇戰銀可避免　獻里歐表示願爲和平努力</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎十一一日電〕法議會昨日開慕，共黨領袖賈香發表演說，渠不僅未如往常之指責西方帝國主義，且謂美蘇戰爭可避免，此與其去年攻擊美法政府之演說完全相反。此問各報評論，對賈香演說成感驚奇，是否爲共黨之授意，抑或受命於克林姆宮而出此妥協之建議。議長赫里歐稱，法國有資格可作調和美蘇之和平努力，負責人士認爲倘政府同意，赫氏將樂於以特使名義赴美一行，亦願赴蘇作爲歐洲聯盟之代表，担任史達林與杜魯門問之橋樑。</p>
<h3>蘇威脅柏林空運　將演習跳傘射擊</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十三日電〕蘇聯經一度靜默後，十三日又開始對西歐國家宣傳之攻勢，其發展如下：第一，蘇聯直接担任一切柏林蘇區與西區間貨物之移動以前係由蘇境之德傀儡政府所担任。第二，蘇聯再度成脅將在西方走廊舉行跳傘演習及射擊演習。第三，揚言反對「西德邊疆之改變」。蘇聯在四國航空安全站通知稱，蘇傘兵將舉行演習，地點在勃克堡走廊附近，蘇軍亦將在漢堡走廊上之勃萊登堡附近舉行射擊。　貝文許曼舉行商談　調和英法間歧見　北歐三國締盟談判破裂</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕法外長許曼巳於今日抵此，將與貝文外相作兩天之會議。彼等將討論各項國際問題，諸如北大西洋聯防公約，義殖民地，中東，德國等問題。此次許貝會議目的在制止英法政策中日趨嚴重之歧見，並不在獲致上項谷問題最後決議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十三日電〕外交界有資格人士今日稱，瑞典挪威及丹麥三國締結聯防同盟之談判已告破裂。丹挪希望三國同盟與美國領導之北大西洋同盟發生聯繫，但瑞典則堅持必須採取其傳統之中立政策，以免捲入東西雙方之糾紛。預料挪丹兩國在數星期內，將接受西方各國之邀請，參加北大西洋同盟。</p>
<h3>英美在中東利害衝突　形成政治對峙局面　英反對黨對貝文表示不滿</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十三日電〕由於英國與猶太問之外交法鬥，美英兩國在巴勒斯坦存在之團結與調和，十三日似已決裂。有經驗之聯合國外交家相信，英美兩國對聖地之歧見，可能發展成兩國在中東整個部份之一部份上，形成政治對峙局面。</p>
<p>此一信念於報上載稱，埃及突然決定與以色列談判和平之動機，乃埃及極望，調整兩國間關係之後，益爲可信。一美國官員稱，埃及領袖對其國家受英國直接或間接控制已久，極望打破此一桎梏，與美國成立更强之政治經濟連繫，蓋英國推行一有利於外約但之聖地和平解決，而美國壓施一有利於埃及之立卽和平。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十三日電〕政府要員今日在閣議後宣稱，全體閣員顯然一致擁護外長貝文對巴勒斯坦之政策，英國在中東採取之路綫決不改變。下院規定十八日復會，屆時貝文料將出席詳細報告中東局勢。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十二日電〕此間各報對貝文及其政策紛加責難。保守黨領袖艾登今日在畢維克發表談話稱，英機在以埃戰區上空飛行華無目的，殊可惋惜。以色列眾擊落英機實爲一種侵略性的攻擊，但試問政府在此種情形下，派機偵察戰區上空有何必要。再者，當局對於中東之政策，恐將危及英美邦交。</p>
<h3>淾霹淾抵巴黎</h3>

<h3>物價高漲威脅工人生活　總工會請願提兩項要求　罷工怠工漸多　社局嚴令制止　任何要求非待復常概不處理</h3>

<p>社會局長吳開先昨日特發表談話如下：「近來物價高泓，工人生活感受威脅確係事實，本人亦深致關切同情。惟物價高漲，生活指數亦隨之增加，本月份上期指數發表在卽，而少數工人竟不依正常手續擅自怠工罷工，實屬不合。查晨曆年關在邇，地方治安尤關重要，匪諜意圖昨用機會散佈謠言，從事煽惑，或鼓動工潮以達其擾亂社會秩序之目的。值此戒嚴時期，政府對一切破壞公衆利益之任何舉動早具撲滅決心，絕不容陰謀得逞，深望我多數善良工人勿受利用，如有要求，仍按合法手續，政府決盡最大努力爲之設法解決。如有擅自怠工罷工等不法行動，一律移請治安機關依照戒嚴法嚴予懲處，任何要求非待恢復常態後，概不予處理」。</p>

<h3>配米價隨時調整　吳市長說明苦衷　配價過低有二種後患　本月不調整說不能保證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨日下午五時，抱病至市府招待記者，鄭重發表戶口米配價，今後將按市價隨時調整，渠稱：近日各界對於配米價格是否將隨時調整一點，傳說紛紜，此係市民所最關懷者，故特爲解釋，希取得市民諒解。按此次配米價格隨時調整決策，係經濟配合委員會所決定，該會係由行政院，美援物資運用委員會及美經合總署中國分署聯合組成，今後配米價格之如何調整及何時調整，均由該會決定之。本人以民調會主委立塲竭力贊成中央此一決策。余明知市民皆願食便宜米，高價米總不歡迎，惟目前政府最重要之任務，在於充實米源。去年十一月問米荒之慘痛現象，市民當不致忘却。如配米價格過低，即可能有二種後患：（一）美援米及洋米均按美金計算，其價格因而較高，故若欲配米之廉價供應，除非政府有無窮盡之美援，及國庫可予補貼，然事實上美援及國庫均屬有限，是則配米成本高而所得米款愈久愈少，則政府採購食米能力消弱，影響配米量，逐漸减少，終至配米政策不能持久。（二）米價與物價上漲比例本來相同，如配價過低，則鄉村米即不願到城市來，而都市米即不願出賣，本市全部配米量之百分之六十三，須中央自籌供配，百分之三十七係靠外來，故配米價格無法太低。</p>
<p>市民爭先搶購　認爲是好現象</p>
<p>至於報載配米價格本月份不調整一點，實屬錯誤，須加以更正，惟對於何時調整一點，本人尚不知悉，因係由該委員會應實際需要而加以調整。此項決策實行後，預計市民均將赴米店爭先搶購，本人認爲此亦屬好現象，因過去市民均至月底才往購買，至政府得款時因受物似上漲影響已無法補進。現市民先予搶購，政府卽可早得米款，交緊急儲購委員會立卽採購，卽不至吃虧。吳市長之結論爲：當今之世，足食第一，故使米源充沛乃當務之急，希人民能與政府合作，體諒政府苦衷，明瞭政府意旨云云。</p>
<p>不肖米店拒售　民調會正澈查</p>
<p>對於市民有發現米店拒售配米者，吳市為昨表示：可逕向民調會報告。渠稱：本市發現有少數不肖米店拒售情事，業由民調會加以澈查，民調會每日平均有三。四萬担米分發各米店供應，當不應有上項情事發生。。</p>
<p>又民調會調配處長昨表示：民調會僅係業務機構，並非決策機構，平時所掌管者乃食米之分送，及米證之分發云。</p>
<p>十二月重點證　可以代替使用</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據民食調配會息：一月份私立大中小學教職員工及眷屬與新聞記者及眷屬之重點配給米證，係以三十七年十二月份產職業工人重點配給米證代替，民食調配處已通知各駐區專員，檢發米證樣本，轉飭各米店，凡持有上項配給證者，仍可照常購米。</p>
<p>配米尙未發到　市民深表疑慮</p>
<p>又自民調會配米隨時調整售價消息傳出後，市民爲避免受到漲價影響，向各米店購買戶口米者，日形擁擠，惟一部份米店或以配米尚未發到，或以祗有整米，而碎米尚未發到，以致無法出售，在此配米價格隨時調整聲中，致使一般市民更形疑慮。故深望各區專員隨時調節，俾得早日出售，以維民食。</p>

<h3>中紡昨日拋售四次　紗市漲風略被抑止　共售紗一七四件收款八百餘萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨代中央銀行，美經合分署，美援運用委會等大量拋紗，計自昨日上午十一時十分起，至十二時止，共分四次掛牌拋紗，結果共售各支紗一七四件，收回價款計八，七九六，五〇〇元。茲探誌昨日四次拋售時間，售紗種類，價格，及件數如次：第一次掛牌十一時十分至十一時十二分，售出廿支雙地球一二四件，每件四萬七千元。第二次掛辦十一時廿分至十一時四十分，售出四二支雙股紅藍鳳十件，每件八萬二千元。第三次掛牌十一時卅分至十一時五十分，售出卅二支藍鳳十七件，每件六五五〇〇元。第四次掛牌十一時四十分至十二時，售出廿支金鷄廿三件，每件四萬五千元。</p>
<p>又該公司昨仍循例售布，結果共售二六八七〇疋，收回價款四六，〇〇三，八〇〇元。准購單共四九九張。</p>
<h3>紗市賣氣濃厚</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗塲中一片賣出空氣，一般納戶咸認為銀根緊勢未已，無意吸入。雖執戶竭力喊高，但問津者寥若晨星，市氣終告鬆落。投機籌碼如四二支藍鳳及二一支雙馬跌風尤爲猛烈，初開四二支藍鳳七七〇〇〇元，中途曾漲達上日八八〇〇〇元之午收價，最後復回跌至七九〇〇〇元，結果較前瀉一一〇〇〇元。四〇支藍鳳終降八〇〇〇元。三二支銀月由六三〇〇〇元喊至七〇〇〇〇元爲最高，午收退至六六〇〇〇元，軋低七〇〇〇元。二一支雙馬現貨晨開四八〇〇〇元，一度喊　至五五〇〇〇元，終以五〇〇〇〇元收市，較前猛挫一〇〇〇〇元。廠單四五五〇〇元。套利一天期，最後做三〇〇〇元。二〇支雙馬軋降八〇〇〇元，餘紗皆趨下游。如當局繼續在市塲掛牌拋售，則最近期內恐難以轉好。</p>
<h3>棉布交易冷落</h3>
<p>布市平穩，客帮僅華南方面有納，餘帮皆抱觀望態度。本街進意亦懈，尤以銀根仍緊，塲中交易異常冷落。龍頭細布塲外大致喊二〇〇〇元左右，細布擋子仍缺，塲上祗做開大雙龍與三桃等，市價俱與前相仿。四君子元嗶嘰初開一八〇〇元，最高一八六〇元，最低一七一〇元，午收依然站住上日一八三〇地之原擋未動。中擋嗶嘰如金蓮妙舞及雷峯塔等，則漲跌互見。惟上落範圍頗爲狹隘。四君子元直貢軋降二〇元，以一九三〇元結局。一九〇士林等因燃料又見猛漲，故廠盤反見提高。</p>
<h3>絲線　綢織續回跌</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况繼續回瀉，市上銀根轉鬆，暗息回低，惟因業外各物欲升無力，紗布當局拋售，市價亦軟，因之人心散漫，買氣外匯。</p>
<p>不旺。</p>
<p>一二〇號天橋晨開八五〇〇〇元，開後因中信局本週配貨充足，配價亦低，絲織業納胃先淡，同業因實銷不振，辦意鬆懈，塲上脫意尚濃，價見下游，低見八一〇〇〇元，中間微盤微升，收市仍站原價，午後趨勢略堅，喊價稍好，惟交易不旺。</p>
<p>生絲外匯移轉證先高後平，市勢初尚堅穩，繼因圈外物價報跌，外銷不動，散戶了售，人心見虛，業內銀根有寬有鬆，暗息雖回，然吸納轉淡，優級另担，晨以現貨九〇〇〇〇元喊開，中間問津者少，多頭了結，市勢步入軟檔，收市小落五〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>綢縀市况先平後堅，業內銀根鬆濫，散冬扒吸，市勢似見升騰之象，中因紗布壓小，買氣旺後轉鈍，收市仍挫。美亞被面先以平盤開喊，納意尚有，價見上升，惟因告物均軟，大勢無從掙扎，　面亦不敢哄抬，直至收市，停住於四八〇〇〇元結束，終見軋小，大誠嗶縐大偉呢，均見帶小。</p>
<h3>進戶納胃呆疲　食米上落狹隘　雜糧汕餅市況均挫落</h3>
<p>食米市勢轉見緩和，上落轉狹，晨開因無錫價格回漲，故貨主扳高，喊起五十元，但因暗息高昂，進戶納胃頗呆，欲升無力，收市更因供多求少，略見下疲三五十元，白粳一千四百元，計跌四十五元，早薄稻各削二三十元，羊秈挫七十元，以一千四百元開出。北市塲白粳平定，早薄稻降二三十元，南北市到貨與計九千六百三十八石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>上落不多，業外各物俱平，人心殊穩，早開略見扳高，但去路不暢，收市略低，老車最高五百二十一元，後以五百十五元收市，與昨日相平，兵船粉收市五百二元，較昨略低二元，紅蜂及建成爲四百八十九元，及四百九十元，下降二三元。麩皮微昂三元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>透疲，價格俱見稍降，黄豆油廠不取，降落四五十元，苞米靑島帮無納胃，降落一百五十元，揀靑價高下降五十元及七十元，菉豆銷呆，下降五十至百元，紅糧供多化滯，客帮無胃，僅內地去化，降五十元。芝蔴高貨尚定，中下貨下挫一百元，生仁廣帮稍有納取，價亦隨各糧降二百元。</p>
<p>食汕略見疲落，價格上落轉狹，交易亦轉平靜，因暗息高昂，出多進少，豆菜油及生油普遍跌落二百元，豆油收市四千六百元，吉桶生油五千一百元，生菜油收市四千三百元，熟菜油交易不多，小車蔴油降落百元，豆餅亦稍挫十元。</p>
<h3>食根走勢轉平　市拆尚站高盤</h3>
<p>昨日市間銀根，俏中呈穩。緣外埠匯款，國庫支出，頗見鉅大。但當局表示擴大拋售紗布，以及其他物資，各方皆有戒心，週轉尚稱靈動。頭寸供源轉暢，唯市塲拆息，則仍高站日拆六十元以上，迄八十元不等，合月息仍爲二元左右。今後銀根前途，變化將更甚，工商業應加謹慎。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日現鈔籌碼，因月中伊邇，市需日增，更見緊　。太票續飛，貼水高達百分之十。</p>
<h3>僑匯掛二百元　外匯移轉證續升</h3>
<p>中央銀行僑匯掛牌，昨日又升十元，每美元增至金圓券二百元　外匯移轉證市價，昨日初做一九〇元進，曾高至二〇一元，最後價爲一九六元進，一九七元出，較前日又升七元五角。</p>
<h3>國行正式否認　限制匯款來滬</h3>
<p>對存戶提款亦無硬性規定</p>
<p>外傳國行方面，爲抽堅銀根，安定市面起見，已着手對匯款來滬及存戶提款，加以限制一說。國行業務局方面，巳予正式否認。該局某負責人稱，迄至今日爲止，余對此並無所聞。且就事實而言，在此時此地，實施限制提款及匯款來滬，實無必要。彼並指出對於應付因銀根鬆動而引起之物價波動，各有關機構，業已決定大量拋售物質。至於一般行莊，目前所行對存戶提款之限制，全係各行莊感於自身現鈔缺乏時之個別辦法，國行方面對此，並無硬性之規定云。</p>
<h3>茶市堅俏</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，開後卽在複製成本高昻，及茶存涸枯兩項原因中，頻將人心激動，賣戶一意居奇堅售，致趨勢續吐秀氣，售價高漲，再接再厲，尤以祁門花香陳絲茶芯等低擋花色，因本街等地力搜，市氣愈益悄利，交易亦頗活潑，餘則仍以買方未多吸納，成交數量尚少。</p>
<h3>台糖走勢略疲</h3>
<p>食糖昨市走勢再疲，週來台糖公司不斷供配，本客帮納意轉淡，圈外環境無任何刺激，人心見疲，檯面靜觀，業內游資流移，銀根未見鬆象，暗息仍百元左右，於是脫意漸衆，市勢反回。45號車白精在軟檔中略見硬紥外，其餘組砂興白赤綿赤合赤海赤本廠冰等，均回小幾十元。</p>
<h3>桐油盤旋</h3>
<p>桐油昨市趨勢仍若膠着狀態，行情一致屹立不變，緣因在銀根似鬆尚緊，加以各方實需未見踴躍，故貨方欲抬無力，卒呈盤檔局面，綜觀此種情形，暫時恐少起仆。</p>
<h3>基隆船雲集　台煤裝運困難</h3>
<p>本市燃料，數月來極感缺乏。柴油存量短少，當局配給各廠，暫改八折供應。煤荒之解決，中央燃煤調配處預計太月運滬八八·〇〇〇噸，內中六六·〇〇〇噸台煤，餘爲蘇聯及美煤。截至目前止，台煤尚無到滬。因台灣基隆等出口港船隻雲集，裝卸困難，及工人要求調整扛力價而擱淺。</p>
<p>又悉：本月六六·〇〇〇噸如全數到齊，分配辦法，（一）公用事業三二·〇〇〇噸，（二）廠商電力公司等用戶配二四·〇〇〇噸。</p>
<h3>呢絨上升</h3>
<p>農曆歲尾呢羢銷路轉寂，但價則上升，昨稍可入目之花呢袍料一件，普通均掛沽五千元以上，西裝一套齊定七千元左右，花洋布袖裹綢每碼批沽一百元，德鹽灰軟襯五十元，防雨布一百六十元，維一大衣呢一千九百元。</p>

<p>淮鹽產區相繼淪陷，川鹽又復陷於停頓狀態中。政府爲調劑軍需民食，決辦理緊急鹽貸。中央銀行貼放會，正擬定辦法中。此項緊急鹽貸，以搶運台鹽及靑島鹽，及恢復川鹽增產爲主，貸款數額共爲四千萬元。內二千萬元爲搶遝台靑食鹽，另二千萬元爲川鹽增產費用。搶運合靑食鹽，將交由中國交通兩行貸放，以五十萬報爲搶運目標，每担貸放四十元。但目前鹽價，每担實際在三百元左右，與事實需要相去甚遠。且交通困難，運輸不暢，鹽商均不願利用是項貸款，以免冒此風險，遭受意外損失。</p>
<h3>機器製釘工業　產銷日趲銳減</h3>
<p>據本市工業會發表，本市機器製釘工業近况如下：</p>
<p>該業初僅中國·五福·公覲三家，目前已有會員工廠達七十餘家之多，各廠產品以一吋至三吋元釘，與十八號至八號鐵絲爲大宗，其餘如鞋釘·鍍鋅鐵絲·機器螺絲·木螺絲·有刺鐵絲等，均爲主要出品。目前各廠主要設備，共有裝釘車七百部，拉絲車八百八十部，鞋釘車一百七十八部，本螺絲車二百卅五部，機器螺絲車三十五部，鍍鋅鐵絲車五十八部，有刺鐵絲車十一部，電動機四百九十二部，發電機五部。製釘工業所需主要原料爲鐵絲及盤元。唯鍍鋅鐵絲所需原料除盤元鐵絲外，平均每担成品尚需鋅塊十斤。過去鐵絲及盤元，國內產量極少，全賴外貨供應。目前本市鋼鐵公司第二廠月產可達八百餘噸，其他鋼鐵廠廿家，所產之元絲，每月亦有千餘噸。太螺絲分鋼鐵二種，平均每羅約需盤元及鋼絲五斤。各廠總產量最高時每月可犛元釘十萬桶，鞋釘二萬箱，鐵絲二萬担，鍍鋅鐵絲二萬担，機器螺絲四萬羅，木螺絲二十二萬羅，有刺鐵絲三萬捲。除供應本市及全國外，尚有百分之四十可運銷南洋。目前因物價波動，工資高昂，輸入原料物料匪易，故成本激增。同時工商各業普遍萎縮，人民購買力薄弱，產量銷路，日趨銳减，該業前途未可樂觀云。</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽新設備　電動記錄器完成　計分時完全用電力控制　將在本屆聯賽中開始使用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四屆籃球聯賽　將於下週展幕，市體育館球塲地板已重行修理，全部油漆刷新。燈光方面，亦另行添置强烈之迥光燈廿一蓋，委託實驗電影工塲代爲裝置，熱水淋洛亦經裝妥。其中最主要之新設備爲籃球電動記錄器之完成。該器包括三部，爲電力記分，電力計時，電力放光。完全用電力控制，僅需一人管理，將過去之人工記分，人工計時完全省去，且極度準確，不啻爲中國體育設備之一大創造與革新。該器設計奢爲本市體協籃球委員會主席錢旭滄，並委請本市LB實驗室（卽李氏兄弟實驗室）代爲協助精製完全。錢君過去對本市籃球設備，頗多革新，曾創製跳動式籃球計時器，在第七屆全運會籃球決賽時採用，成績優良。去秋赴英參觀世運，又赴美游歷考察，對籃球益多心得。此次電動記錄器之完成，可謂極大成功。該機製造，代價甚鉅，由熱心體育之正泰橡膠廠及ABC糖菓公司共同捐助。該機內容如下：（一）記分部——字母淸晰，用電鈕控制，不必再用人工翻分。（二）計時部——以巨型電鐘製成，黑底白字，分針一周二十分鐘，（卽甲組比賽時間之一半）秒針一周仍爲六十秒，並以倒算法計算，鐘針停止處，卽爲比賽之剩餘時間，以便迅速觀察。（三）放光部——特裝置在電鐘之裏邊緣，光綫絕不刺目，暫停時鐘面放出紅光，進行時鐘面放出綠光，此種光綫，可代表信號，又可使鐘面淸晰，其他如上下半時之表明，亦在該機上明顯表示。</p>
<h3>南市足球賽　靑白陣容欠佳　華光淨勝四球</h3>
<p>快速部隊華光小將昨憑其努力不懈，行動快速，及細糯之合作，爽辣之脚頭，竟以四對零壓倒靑白隊，贏得全塲千餘觀衆之熱烈捧塲，此爲南市聯賽本季中之驚人奇績。靑白遇此空前的挨打局面，與其謂爲輕敵，毋寗說是碰着了惡時辰，蓋任何强勁之球隊，在其發展的過程中，總不免遭受一二次意外的挫折，資格老練如孟義良，昨亦僅能搖頭洩氣。靑白陣容太差，當爲慘敗之最大原因。</p>
<p>戰程經過</p>
<p>華光全隊踢來俱佳，鋒綫無可批評，衛綫亦少失漏，個人方面吳其祺坐鎭中央，轍送糧秣，並顧後防，自最勞苦功高，陳惠民之守門及左右翼朱家錚尚世琪，亦爲特出人才，至於靑白既遇惡時辰，脚風自多不順，可按下不表。</p>
<p>三時十分，靑白開球，球被華光截獲，右翼尚世琪沿邊挺進，一脚勾中，卽被錢允慶順勢射中，離開賽不滿一分鐘。靑白反攻失效，華光再度活躍，但皆阻於靑白之衛綫，彼此相持不決，凡廿餘分鐘，雙方踢來俱多精彩，叫好之聲不絕於耳。廿四分鐘，華光左路興兵，朱家錚一脚遠射，又告中的，此球急而力較第一球更爲美麗，不四分鐘吳祺祥身先士卒，上前綫打門，居然破門而入，造成三對零之絕對優勢。</p>
<p>下半時開始，靑白力取攻勢，以求翻本，無奈操之過急，出脚每與心願相違，俄頃華光鋒綫，又如生龍活虎，一般頻頻向靑白腹地推進。十三分鐘時，華光朱家錚邊陲起義，盤球衝刺，騙過蔣震寗，在廿五碼外遠射，球高而有力，竟從門之右上角接近横木處穿入網窩，漂亮之極。陳克明除目送外，別無他法，華光乃共勝四球。局面到此地步，靑白實感回天乏術，連最後十分鐘時，孟義良單槍匹馬，逐球前進，對方後衛早已騙過，卽守門陳惠民亦已遠離崗位，留着一座空門，等待與孟義良接吻，竟然打一高球，越續木而野逸，此非命運而何，結果四比零，靑白走麥城。兩軍配備期下。</p>

<h3>川省建設之路</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　周學端</p>
<p>〔本報成都十日航訊〕四川今日的建設工程，大抵可包括下列諸項：卽鐵路·工礦·公路·農村四方面，都各有積極興建的計劃與實踐，茲就所探知的現狀作一次綜合的報道如次：</p>
<p>天成鐵路　動工在即</p>
<p>天成鐵路經交通部工程團勘測半載，現已完竣，全路由天水外西卅里起，經牡丹洞·鹽關·兩河口，沿嘉陵江至廣元·江油·綿陽·廣漢達成都。工程費已由交部擬就預算，並將請撥部份美援補助，本月開始動工。</p>
<p>發展工礦　劃分四區</p>
<p>川省府爲發展工礦事業，頃特將全川劃爲四開採區，積極從事開發。計：（一）威遠區，包括自貢·樂山·資中十五縣。（二）瀘縣區，包括寗賓·江津·南溪十四縣。（三）重慶區，包括江北·南光·銅梁廿三縣。（四）萬縣區，包括雲腸·城口·巫溪十七縣。分別特產，積極開發。</p>
<p>成渝鐵路　工程發軔</p>
<p>成渝鐵路因經費動用完竣，工程前曾陷入停頓狀態，渝永區段須俟明春洪水季節，在美所購器材全部運到後，始展開舖軌工程。渝通段，現正積極進行土石方工程，如中途不發生阻障，明年七月當可全棧通車。</p>
<p>復興農村　發展特產</p>
<p>川省府爲復興川省農村，發展特產，頃擬建設川省新農村計劃，決定三原則：（一）第一期推廣川西平原雜糧·簡陽美菸·三台棉花·樂山白臘·資內食糖·開縣桐油·石柱等縣川芎·當歸·貝母等藥材。（二）成立川省農村復興委員會。（三）按照美援百分六五·中央十五·地方廿募集經費。</p>
<p>三大公路　緊急搶修</p>
<p>川省府爲護衛川防，特緊急搶修三大國防公銘，施工進度：（一）綿　公路，經緊急搶修，全路已勉强迎車，基本永久工程，正由川公路局發動民工興修，渝綏署特派視察團督修後，巳請中央補助經費，限期完成全路。（二）成巴公路，加緊搶修，沿路之金堂儀隴巴中各縣，芷發動數十萬民工晝夜趕工，如中央補助之基本工程費，短期迅速撥到，全路可如限完成。（三）達廣公路，雖經晝夜搶修，但中央僅補助五萬元，工程進度甚爲延緩。</p>
<p>川滇鐵路　即日復工</p>
<p>交部以川滇鐵路，關係大西南建設前途，因事實需要，決短期復工。該路由雲南霑益至四川隆昌，全長六百餘公里，路基早經完成，刻交部在美訂購大批鋼軌鋼架等材料，儲作該路復工之用，所需枕本，則在川滇就地採購，開工期近，交部已電川省府請予協助。</p>
<h3>南通和囤案詳情</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　叢永樞</p>
<p>〔本報南通十日訊〕南通的食米自從與棉紗結成了不解緣後，小民們便紛紛叫苦了。現在米與紗的比例是這樣的：一石好白米，要換大生紗廠出的二十支紅魁紗二小包半，次一點的，也要換二小包。於是紗漲了，米也漲，可是，紗跌呢，米却站住，除夕日指揮所經濟處的經濟會議中硬性規定的米價早已成爲具文。米是不可或缺的食糧，這樣瘋狂的漲風，給民生以一個直接的威脅。</p>
<p>米店門被轟開在此種情勢下，「摻米·和圃」的事件便接連在縣城西北的唐閘鎭發生了。事情的經過是這樣的：大生紗廠一小部份工友，爲了買米與米商發生衝突，第二天，九日的早晨六點鐘，夜班工友散工時，工人羣集轟開米店，將各種食糧：米，小麥，大豆，麵粉等互相摻和一起，亂動中，也有搗毀商號用具的事發生，牽延連續約二三小時始告平息。結果，以振泰，恒益公等兩家損失長重，當時並有一女工受傷。</p>
<p>悲慘事件重演十日的早晨六點鐘，「摻米和囤」的事又重演了。事態較前更爲擴大。這次被轟開門的，計有大興隆，振泰，萬豐德，鼎泰，恒益公等幾家，因爲有幾家糧行兼營油業，鼎泰，恒益公是油米廠，於是食米摻小麥，小麥摻麵粉，舊戲重唱，新花樣是將麵粉米，棉紗寺一並浸入油缸，一商號樓上囤有棉紗約三箱，也被一小包一小包從樓上摔到街心，路上的騷動者又復把小包拆散，向空中亂拋，於是屋簷上，電綫上，都掛上了散亂的棉紗。一部份人且闖入油坊，把機器搗毀，其他三家的傢俱也都被同樣摧毀了，拆光了。</p>
<p>張分隊長被擊此時情况紊亂已極，自衛隊乃鳴槍示威，詎騷動者竟湧向該隊員，拳足交加之下，遺失駁壳槍一支，該隊員連呼：「沒有槍了，還打什麼？自衛隊張分隊長無法維持秩序，騷動中爲一暴徒當頭一棍，竟將腦骨擊破，頓時暈倒，當經送醫院急救。唐閘爲南通之建設實騐區，區長顧淵如聞訊，趕往肇事地區勸導，在混亂中亦爲騷動羣衆連抹鼻子數把，無法開口講話。十日之騷動，自上午六時開始，至千刻始全部平息。參與摻米和圍者，除部分大生工友外，尚有少數行人參加。</p>
<p>避免再生事端</p>
<p>事後，唐閘實騐區署，警察分局，及大生工會，召開會議，勸導工友息事，同時糧菜公會亦舉行會議，改議米價。有稱工人購米時，因第一批報價每石二千八百元，待第二批到，報價竟達三千二百元一石，前後相距時間甚短，而價格則相差懸殊，致工人激憤而出此行動。惟糧會負責人則稱：絕無此高價，九日唐閘糧市，白米每石二千四百元，秈米每石二千元，十日議價，爲免再生事端，乃各减去一百元，白米二千三百元，秈米一千九百元。</p>
<p>但這件「和囤」案，善後辦法，尚在擬議中，而被打傷的自衛隊張分隊長，却已於下午因傷重不治而身死！</p>
<h3>鎭江破獲資匪案　人槍帶警局嚴</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江十二日電〕省會警察局十一日破獲一重大資匪嫌疑案，緣有民船一艘，於月初由寶應駛鎭河濱公園河面停泊，經當地崗警發覺該船有異，旋報告總局出動大批警士加以搜查，當在船內搜出快機手槍一支，步槍子彈六十二粒，當將該船船主葛廣仁及船伙王義·朱貴祥·趙維章帶局訊問。省警局十二日晨復根據綫索，在城內王通事巷廿一號張志成家及西府街三號范成喜家中，各搜出步槍十餘支，子彈三十六發。據省警局某負責人表示；此案有資匪嫌疑，詳情不難水落石出。</p>

<h3>華中剿總政委會訂　收復區農地　緊急處理法</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌九日訊〕華中剿總政務委員會，爲隨戡亂軍事進展免除士地糾紛安定社會秩序起見，特依據綏靖區土地處理辦法之規定，並斟酌地方情形，訂定「收復區農地緊急處理辦法」一種，令頒轄區內各省市政府。該法規定：（一）縣市境一經收復當地政府，應卽分別成立縣（市）各鄉鎭地權調處委員會，調處有關土地權利之糾紛。（二）收復區內之農地，其所有權人爲自耕農者，准予收回自耕，如農作物尚未收穫時，所有權人對現耕種人爲該農作物所用之生產費應予補償。（三）收復區內之農地，其所有權人非目耕農者，在朱依法處理前，准保持其原所有權，仍由現耕農民縱續佃耕等項。該辦法中又規定：在變亂期間，農民欠徼之佃租，一概免予追繳。</p>

<h3>名學者·好校長　竺可楨挑重擔</h3>
<p>— 本報時派員儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州八日訊〕國內有名的高等學府，浙江大學常是其中之一，記者曾和該校很多教授同學閒談，他們對他們的校長都一致推祟。校長竺可積先生，是中央研究院的院士，著名的氣象學者，矮矮身材，淸瘦外表。</p>
<p>對日抗戰時期，竺可楨先生領導着兩浙的成千學子，跋涉關山，到那遙遠的西南後方，在萬山重疊道路崎嶇的貴州遵義，他茹苦含辛，以身作則，與教授和同學們同甘共苦，雖然破爛的校舍，破爛的衣衫，但「浙大」依然保持着無比的光輝。</p>
<p>竺先生在邀義時，除開處理學校行政外，空下來常和同學們談天，問問他們的功課，問問他們的生活，有時也和校工門房們談家常。他們雖然在抗戰中度着艱辛的歲月，但是因着竺先生的慰問，精神上受到很大的鼓勵</p>
<p>竺先生對政治不感興趣，相反的，對文化工作者們却特別尊崇，記得黔南事變，文化人再由貴陽疏散，經遵義到重慶，他必定親訪住處，並爲解決食宿問題，又邀約對同學們演講，雖然在窮困的狀况下，也必設宴款待</p>
<p>他是以純學者的立塲辦教育的，以這一大學作爲研究學術的機構，在「學問」第一的前提下，遵義「浙大」的學生書本裏，實騐室裏，尋求他們的眞理，同學們的近視眼加多了，同樣地，浙大的聲譽也日隆了。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，竺先生又領導着他們跋涉關山，加百姓到風景綺麗的杭州。他依然和同學們常常聊天，依然和校工門房們談家常，但是戰亂不已辦學維艱，使這位以純學者立塲辦教育的人，憂時憂事，感着空前的棘手。</p>
<p>學問是質疑的，學問是浩淼的，所以學者的態度是誠懇而又雍容大度的，正因爲如此，政府責難他偏袒，同學責難他軟弱。他有一次曾向我表示：「我不懂政治，也不會攪政治，現在使我很爲難，所以我很想求去。」同學們終於是天眞的，從壁報·言論以致行動上，都熱切的挽留他們的「好校長」！他被這成千學子的熟情感動得流下淚來，他重新挑起這付艱難的祖子，領導着學子們漫步前進！</p>
<p>徐蚌會戰以後，南京各校無形停課，上海各大學提早放假，平津各大學自「逃兵」胡適之先生飛京後，正不知這萬千優秀的人才，在烽火中如何苦度時日？記者抱着同樣的懷念，同樣的心情，在零下四度，寒風凜冽的早晨，到「浙大」去溜躂一次。</p>
<p>承竺校長在他的辦公室接見我，他穿牙着飽經歲月的呢大衣，他正在研究一種學問，他懷着悽愴的感情告訴我：「近來學校經費情形更壞，連火都生不起。」他繼續說：「教授薪給的平均數，每個人僅能得金圓券七百元，照今天（元月八日）的市價，只買得到一担米，假使一位教授有一位太太，還有兩個孩子，試問如何維持？眼看物價恐怕還要漲上去！幸虧浙省陳主席來後，對大學教授有七斗米配給，所以尚能勉强維持，不過照這樣的情形，我們很躭心陳主席是否可以繼續配給？學校全部辦公費僅一萬二千金圓，十一月電燈費點去十二萬元，十二月當還不止此數，試問如何維持學校行政？」</p>
<p>竺先生對國事很多感慨：「印度自英國承認獨立後，內部也有裂痕，曾幾何時，他們已取銷了敵對的態度，最近爲了荷印之爭，還在他們國內新德里召集起亞洲會議來。我們中國教授們的苦况，人民的苦况，還不是都因着內戰而造成的嗎？」</p>
<p>我於是動問他對於萬一應變的方案，他說：「我們沒有因着時局緊張停過課，我們定一月中旬起大考，考後放寒假三星期，功課不及格的須補考，大概要兩星期，則優良學生可獲三星期的休息，功課不及格的學生僅有一星期的休息，學校根本不打算遷，教育部沒有指示，搬學校不是件易事。」</p>
<p>當然，由於這一次我和他的談話裏，很明顯地，他的祖子更靈了。但是我對他又有一個新的印象，就是他不臨難茍且，他厭惡戰爭，其實凡是眞正的學者，恐怕都是如此的吧！</p>

<h3>University Professors National Policy Research Association Proposes Concrete Peace Program Hoping That Both the Nationalists and Communists Can Accept It Together, and Initiates the Organization of the Peace Promotion Association to Negotiate Peace</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The National Policy Research Association of Chinese University Professors previously issued a telegram responding to the President's proclamation, calling on the CCP for peace and suggesting the convening of a new political consultative conference to organize a coalition government. The association has now launched an initiative to contact parties and social leaders outside the Nationalists and Communists to organize a "Peace Promotion Association" to negotiate peace with both sides and put forward a more concrete peace program, hoping that both sides will sacrifice party interests and accept it together. The peace program drafted by the association is as follows: A. Steps for peace talks: (1) The Nationalist and Communist sides will immediately cease fire, and all troops in all battlefields will retreat a certain number of miles to their original positions. Those who have not participated in the war will stop at their original defense. (2) The Nationalist and Communist sides will immediately stop all propaganda warfare, and both sides will simultaneously release political prisoners and lift the ban on speech. (3) The Nationalist and Communist sides will each send plenipotentiary representatives and organize a new political consultative conference with the third party, and invite friendly countries to mediate. (4) The composition of the new political consultative conference is divided into ten parts: the Nationalist Party, the Communist Party, middle parties, public opinion organs, people's organizations, and social leaders, six representatives each from six aspects, forming a "6-6 ratio system." Mediators will be invited from the four ambassadors of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France. (5) The meeting place of the new political consultative conference will be in Shanghai. B. Methods of the consultative conference: (1) The voting method of the new political consultative conference, matters concerning procedures should be decided by more than one-half of the attendees, and matters concerning resolutions should be decided by more than two-thirds of the attendees. If a resolution cannot be reached, the mediator may arbitrate. (2) All meeting processes and disputes should be announced daily to accept public opinion and public criticism. C. The system of the coalition government: (1) Establish a temporary coalition government, adopting a committee system, and its composition still uses the "6-6 ratio system" of the new political consultative conference, that is, party members account for half, and non-party people's representatives account for half (because the number of party members in all parties in the country may not reach 1% of the total population, the temporary government is to accommodate the fact that each accounts for half), and its chairman is served by a social leader, and two vice-chairmen are served by the Nationalists and Communists respectively. (2) The coalition government separately drafts a temporary government organization law and a common implementation program after the peace talks. (3) In the war zones of both sides, a buffer zone is delineated, and social leaders are responsible for handling local administration, directly under the control of the coalition government. (4) Implement the nationalization of the army. Officers and soldiers of the national defense army are not allowed to have party membership. Active military personnel are not allowed to hold concurrent civil positions. (5) Each party follows democratic methods and engages in political competition. When the temporary government lasts for one year, a general election campaign will be launched to establish a new public opinion organ. (6) The new public opinion organ decides the existence, abolition, or amendment of the constitution, and then generates a formal government based on the constitution.</p>
<h3>British Prosecutor Kerr Discusses CCP Policy</h3>
<p>Compares it to MacArthur's Policy in Japan</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Associated Press, London, 12th] Kerr, a British prosecutor for the Far East International Military Tribunal, compared the CCP's policy to General MacArthur's policy in Japan on the 12th. He told the Royal Empire Association: "According to the records collected from Europeans currently residing in the CCP area, and the original text of the CCP's proclamations, the Chinese Communist Party was originally a party of farmland reform. Their new farmland laws are generally not more radical than those implemented in Japan under MacArthur's pressure. Both do not intend to redistribute the existing cultivated land among the farmers, including the current landlords." Kerr said that he had no intention of criticizing "MacArthur's outstanding achievements," but only to solemnly point out that MacArthur's policy can be a good example of the most effective measure to combat communism.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Gilner, who was Churchill's personal representative to Japan in 1945 and stayed in Japan for three years, also had the same belief as mentioned above. He said: "I refer to this as a new solution to the Far East problem. We should transport raw materials to areas threatened by the Communist Party, which is enough to raise the standard of living higher than the Communist Party allows. This move may ultimately prove to cost less than a vast military operation."</p>

The State Department is expected to submit a reply within a few days, but it will not take concrete action unless it has been carefully considered in London and Paris. At the same time, the United States, the United Kingdom, or France will also seek the Soviet Union's opinion, as all countries seem unwilling to conflict with future Soviet actions. [Associated Press, Nanjing, 12th] It is reported that France's attitude towards the Chinese government's proposal is currently pending a decision from Paris. News from London suggests that the British Foreign Office is currently considering a reply, but as of now, Washington and Moscow remain silent, as do their embassies in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] It is reported that the government has decided to send Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, and Zhang Lisheng to consult with the ambassadors of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union on the issue of mediating the war.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Looking Ahead to the Southeast Asia Conference</h3>
<p>The crisis in Southeast Asia has been further aggravated by the resurgence of the Dutch-Indonesian conflict. No one can deny that imperialism and communism, in the eyes of the people of Southeast Asian countries, are no different from "tyrannical government" and "fierce tigers." If they are not allowed to jointly seek self-defense and self-salvation but are forced to choose one of the two, then in the situation where "tyrannical government is fiercer than tigers," the trend of the Southeast Asian situation is naturally predictable.</p>
<p>Indian leader Nehru, indignant at the Dutch atrocities in Indonesia and seeking to save the crisis in Southeast Asia, specifically called on fourteen Asian countries to send representatives to New Delhi to hold an International Conference on Southeast Asia to discuss the new situation caused by the Dutch invasion of Indonesia. This proposal has not only been unanimously approved by various countries in East Asia but has also aroused the attention of the United Kingdom and the United States. It is generally believed that this conference can assist the United Nations in resolving the Dutch-Indonesian dispute; at the same time, a regional security mechanism can be born from this. Therefore, American political commentator Louis Fischer has requested the US government to send a "sympathetic observer" to participate and believes that this conference will be able to take "effective action" on the Dutch-Indonesian dispute.</p>
<p>The Southeast Asia Conference was originally scheduled to open on the 16th, but due to insufficient preparations, it was postponed to the 20th. There is no doubt that it will be able to open as scheduled at that time. We attach importance to the significance of this conference and are willing to put forward some opinions on the eve of the opening for the reference of Asian countries and other relevant national authorities.</p>
<p>First, the Asian population accounts for half of the world's population, and the area accounts for one-third of the globe. Based on these two points alone, in today's century of the people, Asia actually occupies an important position internationally, which cannot be ignored by anyone. In the past, Asian countries were largely reduced to colonies of advanced European and American industrial countries due to political and economic backwardness, exploited and slaughtered without realizing it. But today, the people of Asia have been stirred by the tide of the great era and have long been thoroughly awakened. In politics, they firmly demand independence and freedom; in economics, they also demand freedom and equality. The turmoil in various Asian countries after the Second World War all contains profound national movements. The independence of India and Burma is certainly so, and the efforts of Vietnam and Indonesia are no different. Therefore, we ask all countries in the world not to treat Asian groups with the old concept of the past—colonies—otherwise, dealing with any disputes will only increase the source of chaos and make the Asian situation worse.</p>
<p>Second, the crisis currently facing the Asian people is that the infiltration of communist forces is like mercury spilling on the ground, penetrating everywhere, so that all Asian countries are threatened by it; another is that the forces of imperialism are deeply rooted. The suffering of the people of Vietnam and Indonesia is the deepest and greatest. Under the principle of "tyrannical government is fiercer than tigers," most people naturally only become more left-leaning. A London Times editorial on the 10th still claimed that the national movements in Southeast Asia would be exploited by Moscow, a view that the people of Asia cannot accept. Taking the recent Dutch invasion of Indonesia as an example, the Netherlands in Indonesia did not hesitate to violate the armistice agreement, directly taking military action and attacking the Indonesian capital Yogyakarta with the army, navy, and air force, exposing the face of imperialism without reservation. Speaking of the United States' handling of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute, it has never had a "firm and unwavering" stance. Although the US representative is now also condemning the Dutch invasion of Indonesia in strong terms, some people still suspect that the United States is secretly supporting the Dutch actions in Indonesia. We hope that the new Secretary of State Acheson will quickly take wise measures to clarify the world's suspicions.</p>
<p>Third, for the sake of self-defense and self-salvation, Asia today does need a regional security mechanism to promote mutual understanding and cooperation among the people of Asia and jointly seek the stability and prosperity of Asia. But this kind of mechanism must be organized by the Asian people themselves. The "Eastern Alliance" advocated by Britain and Australia last December cannot but be viewed with reservations by the people of Asia. First of all, it is necessary to understand who the master of this "Eastern Alliance" is, whether it is the Asian countries or the British and American countries outside Asia. Therefore, standing on the position of the people of Asia, rather than waiting for outsiders to come out and lead the organization of the "Eastern Alliance," it is better to automatically organize an "Asian Alliance" at the New Delhi Conference.</p>
<p>In short, the arrival of the Asian century, like the torrent of the times, is irresistible. The call of the New Delhi Conference is the harbinger of the arrival of the Asian century. The awakening and unity of the Asian people makes all countries in the world cannot but "look at each other with new eyes," unless there are still stubbornly unenlightened imperial powers in the world, otherwise today they will never again treat Asia as a colony.</p>
<h3>Hoffman Condemns the Soviet Union; It is Extremely Close to Seizing All of China; He Also Points Out That Our Reliance on Force to Suppress the Communists is a Fundamental Mistake</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Detroit, 12th, United Press] Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman recently stated here that the Soviet Politburo is doing its utmost to achieve world domination. It is said that the absolute belief has been obtained from the observations made during this global trip, that the primary purpose of Soviet policies and movements is to proceed with strength and determination. Hitler's efforts in those years pale in comparison. Mr. Li's statement was drafted in advance and was made to the Automotive Engineers Association here and is the most vehement condemnation of the Soviet Union by a responsible US official. Hoffman believes that although the recent communist activities in the United States and abroad have been exposed, the American people still do not know what is happening now and are unaware of the seriousness of the threat itself and the global crisis. He continued: The Soviet Union is cruel and unscrupulous, and the cunning and skillful implementation of its policies can only be compared with Machiavelli (a 15th-century conspiratorial politician). It is said that the Soviet government's great dream is to strengthen the control of the Kremlin's satellite states and establish a world dictatorship. He listed the various achievements of the Soviet Union since the Japanese surrender and said that Stalin can be complacent about this result. In addition to seizing several countries in Europe, the Kremlin is extremely close to seizing all of China. The situation in China is extremely serious.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] New York, 12th (Broadcast): Hoffman said in a speech at the Automotive Engineers Conference that in addition to controlling several European countries, the Communist Party will also control all of China, leading to an extremely serious situation. Hoffman said: The fundamental mistake of the Chinese government's war of suppressing the Communists is the mistaken belief that communism can be defeated by force alone. The efforts of the various provinces of China are mostly focused on the military aspect. The leaders of the provinces have concentrated their manpower and material resources in an attempt to contain communism by force, but they have done almost nothing to improve the people's lives, thus creating a tragic ending. However, Hoffman specifically pointed out that Yan Xishan, the chairman of Shanxi Province, alone has true insight into the overall situation and has unique vision. Hoffman recounted that Yan had written a booklet entitled "Methods to Deal with the Communist Party," which said that unless popular support is strong, it is difficult to win the war. Hoffman then quoted some of the proposals in the book, such as eliminating class divisions, organizing mass organizations, discussing government goals, implementing food rationing regardless of wealth, seeking economic equality, and implementing a rural reform militia system.</p>

<h3>Ministry of National Defense Announces Weekly Battle Situation - From January 6th to 12th -</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Ministry of National Defense recently announced the weekly battle situation from January 6th to 12th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>At a time when the whole country is unanimously seeking peace, unexpectedly, the Communist bandits recently launched a major military offensive with their main forces, fiercely attacking the Tianjin and Yongxu areas. It seems that this action of theirs is an informal response to the national people's call for peace. Under the decision and guidance of being able to fight and make peace without avoiding war to seek peace, the National Army soldiers are all able to be loyal and courageous, fighting with the bandits and giving them a heavy blow. The situation of each battlefield is summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Du Yuming Corps Fights Bitterly and Breaks Through</p>
<p>Since Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming transferred to Xuzhou via Nanjing from the Northeast on November 6th, he has commanded the Qiu Qingquan, Sun Yuanliang, and Li Mi corps, continuously fighting with the superior main force of Chen Yi's bandits. The combat period has been two months and six days. In the first month, he fought fiercely with the bandits near Xuzhou more than a dozen times, and destroyed nearly ten columns of bandits. He never rested or reorganized. Later, he was ordered to transfer south from Xuzhou to prevent the joint southward advance of the two bandits, Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng. In early December, he arrived in the area between Yongcheng and Suxian and began main force combat with the bandits. After a month of fierce and bitter fighting, except for the entire Sun Yuanliang corps that had already broken through, the Qiu and Li corps had been besieged by the superior bandits in the small area around Chen Guanzhuang and Qinglongji for the past month, relying entirely on air supply. During this period, they encountered ten days of wind, rain, ice, and snow, and the officers and soldiers suffered from insufficient food and fuel, and were hungry and cold. In a sad mood, they relied on slaughtering warhorses to satisfy their hunger. There was no tree bark or grass roots left in the驻地. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du and Commanders Qiu and Li and other senior generals still shared the joys and sorrows with the soldiers and endured hardships together, often not getting even half a full meal all day long. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du fell ill half a month ago, and the Ministry of National Defense sent planes twice to pick him up for medical treatment, but he refused to leave, saying that he was willing to stay with his troops and share their hardships. Until the morning of the 6th of this month, Chen Bandit gathered the newly replenished first, second, third, fourth, eighth, ninth, tenth, thirteenth, Liangguang, Luzhongnan, Kuaisu, and Bohai fifteen columns, and another three independent brigades, as well as militiamen from Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Jinan, totaling about 300,000 people, and launched an all-out attack. Our Du's troops, in coordination with the air force, fought bloody battles with the bandits for five consecutive days. The fighting was unprecedentedly fierce. During this period, more than 50,000 bandits were killed or wounded by the National Army's counterattacks and aircraft bombings, and the National Army also suffered more than 30,000 casualties. The main positions were completely scorched earth. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du led his troops to break out of the encirclement on the morning of the 10th. Because the bandits had dug more than five long trenches around them and were covered with landmines and artillery, the sacrifices and losses of the breakout troops were inevitable. There are still several units moving westward and southward, fighting along the way. In total, for the past month, our Du Corps was ordered to hold the Yong area, using one month to contain the southward advance of the bandits. The Du Corps only began to break out of the encirclement five days after the deadline. Strategically, it has completed its task of buying time and covering the deployment of the National Army in the Jianghuai area, and has achieved the price of killing or wounding more than 100,000 bandits. The heroic deeds of the entire army's arduous combat and heroic sacrifice are worthy of being a model for the National Army. In the Jianghuai area, all parts of northern Jiangsu are very peaceful due to the strengthened deployment of the National Army. The National Army on the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has been actively launching attacks in the past week, sweeping away the local Communists on both sides of the railway. The important bandit strongholds of Gucheng Tie (about 70 li north of Lai'an City) and Outang Town (east of Dingyuan) were captured by the National Army on the 6th. The Lianghuai Independent Brigade, the 34th Brigade, and the bandit units of Su Yu and Sun Chuanjia were defeated and fled with injuries. There are now no traces of bandits within 40 li on both sides of the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway.</p>
<p>(2) National Army in Tianjin Wins Successive Battles</p>
<p>In Tianjin, fierce battles in the surrounding areas of Tianjin have been unfolding since the 6th. The main force of Lin Biao's bandits, seven columns, launched a full-scale attack. Lin Bandit's approximately 7th and 8th columns attacked the southeastern part of Tianjin City from Huidui, the 9th column attacked due south, the 1st and 2nd columns attacked western Tianjin, and the 3rd column and the Second Independent Brigade attacked northern Tianjin. The battles were most intense on the east and west sides. From the 6th to the 10th, after five days and nights of bloody battles, we defeated the 19th and 21st divisions of the 7th column, the 22nd division of the 8th column, the 4th and 6th divisions of the 2nd column, and one division of the 1st column, killing and wounding more than 21,000 bandits. Our army only suffered heavy losses in five battalions, with less than 3,000 casualties. Although the bandits charged to near the city defense works several times, the offensive of the bandits was contained because our army bravely charged at the bandits and each battlefield was able to win more with less. At the moment, the National Army soldiers are using their victorious emotions and firm confidence to calmly counterattack the bandits. After repeated attacks and defeats, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and had to retreat to the northeast and west for reorganization, and drew the 4th and 5th columns from near Beiping for reinforcement. At the moment, the outer Tianjin fortifications are still standing strong.</p>
<p>In the Tanggu area, there have been no changes in the situation in recent days. The National Army search and suppression troops are constantly making contact with the bandits on the periphery. Xinhuaibeitang and the two places are still being held by the National Army.</p>
<p>In total, in the battle near Tianjin, the National Army has shown an increasingly courageous spirit. Since yesterday, the fighting has slowed down slightly. It is expected that the bandits will definitely attack again after replenishment and reinforcement. At that time, the National Army will give them another heavy blow.</p>
<p>In the Beiping area, since last week, Lin Biao's bandit troops around Beiping have been transferred eastward to besiege Tianjin. The Lin bandits remaining in the suburbs of Beiping are the 11th column and part of the 6th column. The rest are the Nie Rongzhen bandit troops that have fled from the Ping-Sui and Ping-Han lines, including the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, and seventh six columns. In the past week, there have only been sporadic battles in the four suburbs of Beiping. In addition to the occasional mutual bombardment between the bandit and our artillery, the National Army has been driving back small groups of bandits who are disrupting the peace.</p>

<h3>Acheson Attends Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Explains Foreign Policy Views, and Answers Various Inquiries About His Relationship with Hiss and Others</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 13th Broadcast: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee met today to discuss Acheson's nomination as Secretary of State. Acheson made a special trip to the meeting to answer questions. The questions asked by the committee members focused on Acheson's experience, Acheson's relationship with Hiss, a former State Department official who was recently indicted by the Supreme Court for perjury, and the relationship between Acheson's law firm and the Polish government. Acheson said that he and Hiss were colleagues and friends, but Hiss was not his assistant. He also said, "Hiss's Turner, Hiss was my assistant. Turner served the country and was very diligent. He is still an assistant in the law firm I run. He also said that his firm had long severed its relationship with the Polish government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Truman's nominee for Secretary of State, Acheson, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today to answer rumors that he favored a "moderate" policy toward the Soviet Union. Acheson seems confident that he will be able to secure the trust vote of the committee and even the Senate.</p>
<p>Committee Chairman Connally said that Acheson would have the opportunity to answer various rumors from the outside world, such as Acheson's views on foreign policy, his relationship with Hiss (a former State Department official accused of stealing wartime State Department secrets to supply to a Soviet spy ring), and the business relationship between his law firm and the Polish Communist government. Several Republicans privately admitted that a telegram from former Assistant Secretary of State Peel on the evening of the 12th had destroyed their plans. Peel had once opposed Acheson's "friendly" policy toward the Soviet Union, but 致电 the Foreign Relations Committee, saying that he believed that Acheson's views had changed significantly in the past four years. He urged Congress to expedite the approval of Acheson's appointment. Peel himself may appear to testify.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The plan to thoroughly reorganize the U.S. State Department has been drafted by the Hoover Commission. According to geographical distribution, five assistants will be set up in the State Department for the Far East, Near East, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. The new Secretary of State Acheson also participated in this drafting work. Most of the recommendations in the Commission's report are based on a plan drafted a year ago by State Department Assistant Dean Acheson. The original plan was not approved because Secretary of State Marshall and Dean Rusk were busy dealing with diplomatic issues and did not have time to carry out the reorganization plan. Dean Acheson is Dean Acheson's best friend, and Dean Acheson will remain in office after the Secretary of State takes office on the 20th of this month. The main point of the proposed reorganization is to divide the work of the State Department according to country and region, not according to type of work. Under the new system, the work of the Far East Division will include the State Department's policies, economics, intelligence, and public affairs regarding the Far East.</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of Defense Requests Authorization to Send Military Missions Abroad, The Advisory Group to China Can Be Established for a Long Time</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Secretary of Defense Forrestal today submitted a plan to the Senate Armed Services Committee, requesting permission to send military representatives to various parts of the world to promote U.S. global interests. The delegations are divided into three types: (1) general military assistance; (2) American international cooperation, which is actually equivalent to military assistance to American countries; (3) authorizing each delegation to formulate programs for global interests. According to the military delegation plan, it is one of a series of national defense plans of the Forrestal, and other plans will be submitted one after another.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] Once the Forrestal plan is approved, the U.S. military advisory group to China can be established for a long time. According to the considerations for sending a U.S. military advisory group to China, it was granted to the President according to the wartime President's emergency powers, but since the declaration of the end of the emergency law, this power was cancelled.</p>
<h3>U.S. Air Force Plan</h3>
<p>There are still Differences of Opinion Within the Government</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 12th] U.S. Air Force circles and congressional figures said that although President Truman's message to Congress intends to reduce the Air Force's strength to 48 combat teams, Congress may decide to increase it to 70 teams. Currently, the U.S. Air Force has a total of 60 teams, one of which is currently used for the Berlin airlift. It also said that the difference of opinion between Truman and the Air Force leaders is not only about strength, but also about policy, because the Air Force leaders advocate that the United States should adopt a firm policy toward the Soviet Union, while Truman and his advisors fear that increasing the Air Force to 70 teams will be considered a threat to the security of the Soviet Union by the Soviet leaders. Circles close to the Air Force believe that if Truman refuses to increase the Air Force to 70 teams, the Air Force leaders will focus the Air Force's strength on long-range military bombers, rather than on electric combat and light bombers, because heavy bombers can carry huge amounts of bombs and fly 1,000 kilometers away.</p>
<h3>President Truman Suddenly Visits Marshall</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Truman suddenly left the White House on the 12th, took the "Dew Point" to North Carolina, and visited Marshall, who was recuperating. He returned here that night.

<h3>Einstein Recovers, Talks to Reporters About Peace</h3>
<p>Heavily Criticizes the United Nations</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 13th] The famous scientist Albert Einstein was admitted to Brooklyn Hospital for abdominal surgery and is scheduled to be discharged today. According to his remarks to reporters, "There is no reason for the East and West to be hostile to each other. What mankind needs now is a sincere desire to actively cooperate, rather than a dangerous militaristic mentality. If there is no determination to pursue world peace, of course there is no way to find that kind of peace. The United Nations has so far failed to solve the Palestine problem, and has thus reduced its prestige. Reckless compromise with power politics will weaken its spiritual position in the world. The United Nations' long delay in allowing Israel to join the organization has greatly damaged its reputation, and that is the reason." Einstein is 69 years old and is famous throughout the world for his research on atomic fission and the invention of the theory of relativity.</p>
<h3>Seeking Permanent Peace in the Holy Land, Rhode Island Negotiations Begin, Israel Telegraphs that the Army Has Been Demobilized</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rhode Island, Aldophort, 13th] As representatives from Israel and Egypt prepared to meet here to seek peace, a telegram from Tel Aviv said that the Jewish army had begun to demobilize. This historic meeting, which could resolve the entire Palestinian war, is scheduled to begin at 11:00 a.m. on the 13th in the conference room on the lower floor of the Trus Hotel. The talks will be chaired by UN mediator Ponchi, who said the prospects for the talks were "very optimistic."</p>
<p>The general mood in Tel Aviv is that the Palestinian war is over, and the demobilization of the army and the restoration of the country's peacetime economy are now the time. When the Rhode Island talks began, the general situation was in favor of Israel. The Jewish army has de facto occupied the entire Negev Desert area. An Egyptian brigade is still surrounded by the Farouqa in the northern Negev. The Egyptian army is still being forced to retreat to the narrow coastal area, including the main stronghold of Gaza. The ten members of the Egyptian delegation who arrived here are all soldiers, led by Colonel Aidi, showing that Egypt only considers the current negotiations to be about the situation in the Negev region, and not a general political solution. On the other hand, the Israeli delegation of six people, mostly political figures, is headed by Foreign Secretary Eitan, showing that the Jewish side is concerned about a general political solution so that a permanent peace stage can be reached.</p>
<h3>Bombing in Cairo</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 13th] A bomb hidden in a briefcase exploded here on the 13th, killing two people and wounding 22 others. Clark Square near the city center was also damaged.

Otherwise, the High Court and the two major government office buildings would also have been partially blown up.</p>

<p>[U.S. News Agency, Success Lake, 12th] Security Council Chairman Canadian Representative McLaughton said today: The Security Council will continue to consider the Indonesian issue on the 14th, at which time a draft resolution on the action that the Security Council should take will be submitted. U.S. Representative Jessup made a strong statement in the Security Council on the 12th, listing various possible active steps to resolve the Indonesian-Dutch dispute. The Security Council has now obtained a sufficient number of suggestions to be used as a basis for defining the draft resolution. China and Norway also made similar suggestions. McLaughton hopes that these three suggestions can be merged into a clear plan of action for the Security Council.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Success Lake, 12th] The Cuban representative to the Security Council will submit a draft resolution on the Indonesian issue on Friday, which is mainly based on the attitude advocated by U.S. Representative Jessup on Tuesday. According to UN observers, the U.S. position is tantamount to accepting the "status quo" created by the Dutch police action.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Javidia, 13th] Representatives of the Mediation Committee will travel to Bangka Island on the 15th to visit Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta and the other two leaders who are being imprisoned there by the Netherlands.

<h3>French Communist Leader Speaks, A U.S.-Soviet War Can Be Avoided, Heo Offers to Work for Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 11th] The French Parliament opened yesterday, and Communist leader Jiaxiang delivered a speech. He not only did not accuse Western imperialism as usual, but also said that a U.S.-Soviet war can be avoided. This is completely contrary to his speech last year attacking the U.S. and French governments. The comments of various newspapers are surprised by Jiaxiang's speech. Is it authorized by the Communist Party or ordered by the Kremlin to make this compromise proposal? Speaker Heliao said that France is qualified to make peaceful efforts to reconcile the United States and the Soviet Union. Responsible people believe that if the government agrees, Heliao will be happy to go to the United States as a special envoy and is also willing to go to the Soviet Union as a representative of the European Union to serve as a bridge between Stalin and Truman.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Threatens the Berlin Airlift, Will Conduct Parachute and Shooting Exercises</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 13th] After a period of silence, the Soviet Union resumed its propaganda offensive against Western European countries on the 13th, the developments are as follows: First, the Soviet Union directly took over the movement of all goods between the Soviet zone and the western zone of Berlin. Previously, it was undertaken by the German puppet government in the Soviet territory. Second, the Soviet Union once again threatened to hold parachute exercises and shooting exercises in the western corridor. Third, it threatened to oppose the "change of the western German border." The Soviet Union notified the four-nation air safety station that Soviet paratroopers will hold exercises near the Buckburg corridor, and Soviet troops will also hold shooting exercises near Brandenburg on the Hamburg corridor. Bevan Schuman Holds Talks to Reconcile Differences Between Britain and France, The Negotiations for the Alliance of the Three Nordic Countries Break Down</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 13th] French Foreign Minister Schuman arrived here today and will hold a two-day meeting with Foreign Secretary Bevan. They will discuss various international issues, such as the North Atlantic Joint Defense Treaty, Italian colonies, the Middle East, and Germany. The purpose of the Huibei Conference is to stop the increasingly serious differences between British and French policies, and not to reach a final resolution on the above issues.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 13th] Qualified diplomatic figures said today that negotiations for the conclusion of a joint defense alliance between Sweden, Norway, and Denmark have broken down. Denmark and Norway hope that the three-nation alliance will be linked to the U.S.-led North Atlantic Alliance, but Sweden insists on adopting its traditional policy of neutrality to avoid being involved in disputes between East and West. It is expected that Norway and Denmark will accept the invitation of Western countries within a few weeks to join the North Atlantic Alliance.</p>
<h3>British and American Interests Clash in the Middle East, Forming a Political Standoff; British Opposition Expresses Dissatisfaction with Bevin</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 13th] The unity and harmony between the United States and Britain in Palestine appeared to have broken down on the 13th due to the diplomatic struggle between Britain and the Jews. Experienced United Nations diplomats believe that the differences between the United States and Britain over the Holy Land may develop into a political confrontation between the two countries in the entire Middle East region.</p>
<p>This belief was reinforced by reports that Egypt's sudden decision to negotiate peace with Israel was motivated by Egypt's desire to adjust its relations with both countries. An American official said that Egyptian leaders, having long been subjected to direct or indirect British control, were eager to break free from this yoke and establish stronger political and economic ties with the United States, as Britain was promoting a peaceful settlement of the Holy Land that favored Transjordan, while the United States was pressing for an immediate peace that favored Egypt.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 13th] Government officials declared today after a cabinet meeting that all cabinet members clearly and unanimously supported Foreign Secretary Bevin's policy on Palestine, and that Britain's path in the Middle East would not change. The House of Commons is scheduled to reconvene on the 18th, at which time Bevin is expected to attend and report in detail on the situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] Newspapers here have been criticizing Bevin and his policies. Conservative Party leader Eden said today in Bewick that it was regrettable that British aircraft were flying over the Egyptian-Israeli war zone without purpose. The downing of a British aircraft by Israel was an aggressive attack, but the question is, why was the government sending aircraft to scout the war zone in this situation? Furthermore, the government's policy towards the Middle East may jeopardize Anglo-American relations.</p>
<h3>Churchill Arrives in Paris</h3>

<h3>Rising Prices Threaten Workers' Livelihoods; Trade Union Federation Petitions, Presenting Two Demands; Strikes and Slowdowns Increase; Social Affairs Bureau Orders Strict Prohibition; No Requests to be Processed Until Normalcy is Restored</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Rising prices are threatening workers' livelihoods. Workers at several factories have been requesting salary advances and rice loans from their employers. According to sources at the Social Affairs Bureau, from the 12th to the afternoon of the 13th, there have been multiple instances of strikes and slowdowns, mostly involving cotton textile workers, including the workers at the China Textile Company's First Textile Factory and the Xinhe Yarn Factory, who stopped work on the night of the 12th. Other factories, such as Xinyu Second Factory, Xinsheng Yarn Factory, China Textile Company's Second, Third, Sixth, and Seventh Factories, China Textile Company's First Ramie Factory, China Textile Company's First and Second Machine Factories, Yong'an Third Factory, and Hongzhang Yarn Factory, have also stopped work. The reasons for the slowdowns are rice loans, salary advances, or cost-of-living index issues. Upon hearing the news, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately dispatched personnel to stop them and order them to resume work before processing their requests.</p>
<p>Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, made the following statement yesterday: "It is indeed a fact that rising prices are threatening the livelihoods of workers, and I deeply sympathize with them. However, as prices rise, so does the cost-of-living index, and the index for the first half of this month will be released soon. It is inappropriate for a small number of workers to engage in unauthorized slowdowns and strikes without following normal procedures. As the Lunar New Year approaches, local security is of utmost importance. Spies are attempting to take advantage of the opportunity to spread rumors, engage in incitement, or incite labor unrest to disrupt social order. During this period of martial law, the government is determined to suppress any actions that undermine public interest and will not allow any conspiracies to succeed. I sincerely hope that the majority of our good workers will not be exploited. If they have any demands, they should follow legal procedures, and the government will make every effort to resolve them. Any unauthorized slowdowns, strikes, or other illegal actions will be handed over to the security authorities for strict punishment in accordance with martial law. No requests will be processed until normalcy is restored."</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] Due to the recent surge in prices, which has greatly threatened the livelihoods of workers, the Municipal Trade Union Federation decided at a joint meeting of its directors and supervisors that yesterday morning, the chairman, Wen Xuexiang, along with the secretary, Liang Yongjun, standing supervisor Ye Xianggao, and over a dozen others, would petition the Social Affairs Bureau, where they were personally received by Director Wu. The representatives stated the difficult circumstances workers were facing due to the threat of high prices and presented two requests: (1) They hoped that the authorities would take effective measures to address the rising prices as soon as possible. (2) The compilation of the cost-of-living index should be improved, and the price surveys should be absolutely accurate. In the food item of the index, in addition to calculating two dou (a unit of measurement) of rice at the priority ration price, the remaining five dou and nine sheng should be calculated at market price. Director Wu expressed his deep sympathy for the difficulties faced by workers and stated that the government was determined to suppress prices. He hoped that workers could assist, and if any factories or stores engaged in illegal price gouging, he hoped that workers would help report them. Regarding the compilation of the index, Director Wu stated that it was absolutely accurate. As for the request to change the calculation of the rice price, he agreed to submit it to the Price Index Review Committee for research.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Zhou and others also visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government yesterday morning, requesting that the authorities take effective measures to curb the drastically fluctuating prices as soon as possible. As Mayor Wu was on sick leave, Secretary-General Shen received them and agreed to relay their request to the Mayor for review.</p>
<h3>Over Two Hundred Faculty and Staff at Fudan University Cable the Ministry of Education, Urging Improved Treatment; Salaries Only Increased Fivefold, Making it Difficult to Maintain Livelihoods</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] He Dehe and 278 other faculty and staff members of the National Fudan University jointly cabled the Ministry of Education, appealing for improved treatment. The telegram stated, "Since the government's financial and price policies have repeatedly changed, prices in Shanghai have soared more than fortyfold in the past four months, while the monthly salaries of our colleagues are only five times the salary at the time of currency reform (six times including the increment). This meager amount makes it difficult to maintain a livelihood. At present, our colleagues have pawned everything and have no way to borrow money. As a last resort, we appeal to your Ministry and request the following two measures to improve living conditions: (1) Please adjust the salaries of our colleagues every half month according to the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Cost of Living Index. (2) At this time of turmoil, our colleagues are at risk of running out of food at any time. Please pre-pay three months' salary to meet our emergency needs. Looking back, the proposal to reorganize the Executive Yuan of the government has been under discussion for over a month. During this period, the issue of the living treatment of public school teachers nationwide has neither been shelved nor forgotten by the government. Now that the new cabinet has been formed, we hereby propose the above suggestions for improving the living conditions of our colleagues. We earnestly request your prompt approval, for which we will be immensely grateful. Respectfully presented to the Ministry of Education."</p>

<p>[Another Report] In the power supply area of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, there have recently been many troops passing through, and many have secretly connected to the current, causing several substation sheds in the company's area to be damaged and burned down. It has been impossible to replenish them for the time being, resulting in frequent power outages, which has caused great inconvenience to users.

<h3>Rice Ration Prices to be Adjusted Regularly; Mayor Wu Explains Difficulties; Two Potential Problems with Ration Prices Being Too Low; "No Adjustment This Month" Cannot Be Guaranteed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday at 5:00 PM, Mayor Wu, despite being ill, received reporters at the Municipal Government and solemnly announced that household rice ration prices will be adjusted regularly according to market prices in the future. He stated that recently, there have been various rumors regarding whether the ration rice prices will be adjusted from time to time. This is a matter of great concern to the citizens, so he specifically explained it in hopes of gaining the citizens' understanding. The decision to adjust the rice ration prices from time to time was made by the Economic Coordination Committee, which is jointly composed of the Executive Yuan, the U.S. Aid Materials Utilization Committee, and the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch. The committee will decide how and when to adjust the ration rice prices in the future. As the chairman of the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee, he wholeheartedly supports this decision of the central government. He knows that citizens prefer to eat cheap rice and do not welcome high-priced rice. However, the most important task of the government at present is to replenish the rice supply. The citizens should not have forgotten the painful rice shortage in November of last year. If the rice ration prices are too low, there may be two potential problems: (1) U.S. aid rice and foreign rice are calculated in U.S. dollars, so their prices are higher. Therefore, if cheap ration rice is to be supplied, unless the government has endless U.S. aid and the national treasury can subsidize it, but in reality, U.S. aid and the national treasury are limited. Therefore, the cost of ration rice is high, and the rice funds obtained decrease over time, which weakens the government's ability to purchase rice, affecting the ration rice quantity and gradually reducing it until the ration rice policy cannot be sustained. (2) The rate of increase in rice prices and commodity prices is originally the same. If the ration price is too low, then rural rice will be unwilling to come to the city, and urban rice will be unwilling to be sold. Sixty-three percent of the total ration rice quantity in this city must be supplied by the central government from its own sources, and 37 percent relies on external sources. Therefore, the price of ration rice cannot be too low.</p>
<p>Citizens Eagerly Rush to Purchase; Considered a Good Phenomenon</p>
<p>Regarding the news report that the ration rice prices will not be adjusted this month, it is actually incorrect and must be corrected. However, he does not know when the adjustment will be made because the committee will adjust it according to actual needs. After this decision is implemented, it is expected that citizens will rush to purchase rice at the rice stores. He believes that this is also a good phenomenon because in the past, citizens only went to buy at the end of the month. When the government received the funds, it was unable to purchase more rice due to rising commodity prices. Now, citizens are rushing to purchase, and the government can obtain the rice funds early and hand them over to the Emergency Storage and Purchase Committee for immediate purchase, so it will not suffer losses. Mayor Wu concluded that in today's world, food is the first priority. Therefore, making the rice supply abundant is the most urgent task. He hopes that the people can cooperate with the government, understand the government's difficulties, and understand the government's intentions.</p>
<p>Unscrupulous Rice Stores Refuse to Sell; People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Investigating Thoroughly</p>
<p>Regarding citizens discovering that rice stores are refusing to sell ration rice, Mayor Wu stated yesterday that they can report directly to the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee. He said that a few unscrupulous rice stores have been found in this city to be refusing to sell ration rice, and the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee is thoroughly investigating. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee distributes an average of 30,000 to 40,000 dan of rice to various rice stores every day, so the above situation should not occur.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the director of the Distribution Department of the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee stated yesterday that the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee is only an operational organization and not a decision-making organization. It usually manages the distribution of rice and the distribution of rice certificates.</p>
<p>December Key Certificates Can Be Used as Replacements</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the People's Food Allocation Committee, the key ration rice certificates for private primary and secondary school teachers and staff and their families, as well as journalists and their families, for January, will be replaced by the key ration rice certificates for industrial workers for December 1948. The People's Food Allocation Office has notified all district commissioners to inspect and distribute rice certificate samples and to instruct all rice stores that those holding the above ration certificates can still purchase rice as usual.</p>
<p>Ration Rice Has Not Yet Been Distributed; Citizens Express Deep Concern</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the news of the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee's plan to adjust ration rice prices at any time was announced, citizens have been rushing to purchase household rice from various rice stores to avoid being affected by price increases. However, some rice stores claim that the ration rice has not yet been delivered, or that only whole rice is available and broken rice has not yet been delivered, making it impossible to sell. Amid these rumors of ration rice prices being adjusted at any time, the general public is becoming even more concerned. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the district commissioners will adjust the situation at any time so that rice can be sold as soon as possible in order to maintain the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Headquarters Approves Entry; Local Reporters to Fly to Tokyo Again</h3>

The Qiujin ship will sail on the Shanghai-Guangzhou route, starting on the 16th, with one round trip every twelve days. It is reported that there are more passengers traveling from Shanghai to Guangzhou than to Shantou and Xiamen, so the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company plans to transfer additional passenger ships to sail on that route.</p>

<h3>Bearish Sentiment in the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was filled with a bearish atmosphere. Most merchants believed that the tight monetary policy would continue and were unwilling to buy. Although brokers tried their best to raise prices, there were few inquiries, and the market sentiment weakened. Speculative chips such as 42-count Blue Phoenix and 21-count Double Horse yarn experienced the most significant price declines. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn opened at 77,000 yuan, rose to 88,000 yuan, the closing price from the previous day, mid-day, and then fell back to 79,000 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 11,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell by 8,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon yarn was bid up from 63,000 yuan to a high of 70,000 yuan and retreated to 66,000 yuan at mid-day, down by 7,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 48,000 yuan in the morning and were once bid up to 55,000 yuan, but closed at 50,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 10,000 yuan. Factory orders were at 45,500 yuan. One-day arbitrage was last traded at 3,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 8,000 yuan, and the prices of other yarns also trended downwards. If the authorities continue to auction yarn on the market, it will be difficult for the market to improve in the near future.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Cotton Cloth Trading</h3>
<p>The cloth market was stable, with only merchants from South China making purchases. Other merchants adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Merchants in this street were also unenthusiastic, and the market was extremely quiet due to the continued tight monetary policy. The price of Longtou fine cloth was generally bid at around 2,000 yuan, and there was still a shortage of fine cloth. The market mainly traded Kai Da Shuanglong and San Tao cloths, with prices similar to before. Si Junzi Yuan Biji opened at 1,800 yuan, reached a high of 1,860 yuan, a low of 1,710 yuan, and remained at the previous day's level of 1,830 yuan at mid-day. Mid-grade Biji cloths, such as Jinlian Miaowu and Leifengta, experienced mixed price fluctuations. However, the range of fluctuations was quite narrow. Si Junzi Yuan Zhigong fell by 20 yuan, closing at 1,930 yuan. The factory prices of 190 Shilin and other cloths increased due to the sharp rise in fuel prices.</p>

<p>The artificial silk market continued to decline yesterday. The monetary policy in the market loosened, and the black market interest rate decreased. However, because the prices of other goods outside the industry could not rise, and the yarn and cloth authorities sold off, market prices also softened. As a result, market sentiment was scattered, and the buying momentum was weak.</p>
<p>The No. 120 Tianqiao silk opened at 85,000 yuan in the morning. After the opening, because the China Trust Bureau had sufficient deliveries this week and the allocation price was also low, the silk fabric industry's purchasing power was weak. Industry players were unenthusiastic due to weak actual sales, and selling sentiment was still strong in the market. The price fell, reaching a low of 81,000 yuan. There was a slight rise in the middle, but the closing price remained the same. The trend was slightly firmer in the afternoon, and bidding was slightly better, but trading was not strong.</p>
<p>Raw silk foreign exchange transfer certificates were initially high and then flat. The market was initially firm, but because prices of goods outside the industry fell, exports were weak, small investors sold off, and market sentiment turned weak. Although the black market interest rate decreased as some industry players had loose monetary policy and others had tight, the buying power decreased. Superior grade silk was separately handled. The morning opened with spot goods bid at 90,000 yuan. Few inquired in the middle, bulls closed positions, and the market entered a soft phase, closing down slightly by 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The silk fabric market was initially flat and then firm. The industry's monetary policy was loose, small investors scrambled to buy, and the market seemed to be rising. However, because yarn and cloth prices were low, buying momentum turned dull after a strong start, and the market closed down. Meiya quilt covers initially opened flat, and there was still buying interest, and prices rose. However, because the prices of other goods were soft, the overall trend could not be maintained, and the face also dared not bid up. It closed at 48,000 yuan and ultimately fell slightly. Dacheng Biju and Dawei Ne were also slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Power of Traders Weak; Rice Prices Rise and Fall Narrowly; Market Conditions for Coarse Grains and Peanut Cake Fall</h3>
<p>The rice market turned moderate, and price fluctuations narrowed. Due to rising prices in Wuxi, sellers increased prices in the morning, bidding up by 50 yuan. However, due to high black market interest rates, the purchasing power of traders was quite weak, and prices could not rise. Due to abundant supply and low demand, prices slightly declined by 30 to 50 yuan at closing. White Keng rice was 1,400 yuan, a decrease of 45 yuan. Early Bo Dao rice was reduced by 20 to 30 yuan. Yang Xian rice fell by 70 yuan, opening at 1,400 yuan. The Beishi market for white Keng rice was stable, and early Bo Dao rice fell by 20 to 30 yuan. A total of 9,638 shi of goods arrived in the North and South markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>There were not many fluctuations. The prices of goods outside the industry were flat, and market sentiment was stable. Prices rose slightly at the early opening, but the market was not smooth, and prices fell slightly at closing. Lao Che flour reached a high of 521 yuan and then closed at 515 yuan, the same as yesterday. Bingshun flour closed at 502 yuan, slightly lower than yesterday by 2 yuan. Hong Feng and Jiancheng flour were 489 yuan and 490 yuan, a decrease of 2-3 yuan. Bran increased slightly by 3 yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains</p>
<p>The market was weak, and prices fell slightly. Yellow beans were not taken by oil factories, falling by 40 to 50 yuan. Green corn from Qingdao had no purchasing power, falling by 150 yuan. Selected green corn was high-priced, falling by 50 yuan and 70 yuan. Green beans were weakly selling, falling by 50 to 100 yuan. Red grain had abundant supply and slow turnover, and merchants had no purchasing power. Sales were only within the mainland, falling by 50 yuan. Sesame had stable high-priced goods, and medium and low-priced goods fell by 100 yuan. The Guang merchants slightly took raw peanuts, and prices also fell by 200 yuan along with the various grains.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Cooking peanut cake was slightly weak, and price fluctuations narrowed. Trading also turned quiet. Due to high black market interest rates, there were more sales than purchases. Soybean vegetable oil and raw oil fell by 200 yuan across the board. Soybean oil closed at 4,600 yuan, Jilong raw oil at 5,100 yuan, and raw vegetable oil closed at 4,300 yuan. There were not many transactions for cooked vegetable oil. Xiaoche sesame oil fell by 100 yuan, and soybean cake also fell slightly by 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Monetary Market Turns Stable; Interbank Lending Still High</h3>
<p>The monetary market was steady yesterday. The remittance from other places and the expenditure from the national treasury were quite large. However, the authorities indicated that they would expand the sale of yarn, cloth, and other materials. All parties were wary, and the turnover was still flexible. The supply of funds turned smooth, but the interbank lending rate still remained high, above 60 yuan per day, up to 80 yuan. The monthly interest rate was still around 2 yuan. The future of the monetary policy will change even more, and industry and commerce should be more cautious.</p>
<p>Also reported: Yesterday, the cash chips became tighter due to the increasing market demand in the middle of the month. The Taipei currency continued to soar, and the discount reached as high as 10 percent.</p>
<h3>Overseas Remittances Quoted at 200 Yuan; Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The Central Bank's overseas remittance quotation rose again by 10 yuan yesterday, increasing to 200 yuan per U.S. dollar. The market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates initially traded at 190 yuan yesterday, rising to as high as 201 yuan. The final price was 196 yuan for purchase and 197 yuan for sale, an increase of 7 yuan and 5 jiao compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Officially Denies Restrictions on Remittances to Shanghai</h3>
<p>No Mandatory Regulations on Depositor Withdrawals Either</p>
<p>There were rumors that the Central Bank was planning to restrict remittances to Shanghai and depositor withdrawals to tighten monetary policy and stabilize the market. The Central Bank's Business Bureau has officially denied this. An official from the bureau stated that he had not heard of this at all as of today. And in fact, there is no need to implement restrictions on withdrawals and remittances to Shanghai at this time and place. He also pointed out that the relevant agencies have already decided to sell off large quantities of materials to cope with price fluctuations caused by the easing of monetary policy. As for the restrictions on depositor withdrawals currently implemented by general banks and firms, they are all individual measures taken by each bank and firm due to their own lack of cash. The Central Bank does not have any mandatory regulations on this.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Strong</h3>
<p>The tea market was opened yesterday, which frequently stimulated people's hearts due to two reasons: high copy costs and tea stocks were depleted, sellers were determined to live in a rare and strong sale, resulting in a continued show, and the price rose sharply, especially low-end styles, such as Qimen Floral Fragrance Chen Silk Tea Core because this street and other places tried to search, the market was more quietly profitable, and the transaction was quite lively. Others are still that buyers did not absorb, and the number of transactions was still small.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Trends Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>The sugar market fell again yesterday. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation has been continuously supplying and distributing over the past week, and local merchants have reduced their interest. The environment outside the industry has not stimulated the market, the public is tired, the desk quietly watches, and the industry's floating funds have moved. There is no sign of monetary loosening, the black market interest rate is still around 100 yuan, so the intention to sell is gradually increasing, and the market has turned back. Except for the 45th car white essence, which was slightly firm in the soft stall, the prices of other white, red, cotton, and Hainan sea salt were slightly reduced by a few yuan.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Swings</h3>
<p>The tung oil market trend remained in a sticky state yesterday, and the market was consistent and unchanged. The reason is that the monetary policy seems loose and tight, and there is no enthusiastic practical demand from all parties, so the seller wants to raise prices but cannot, and it eventually presents a swing situation. Judging from this situation, it is feared that there will be few trips for the time being.</p>
<h3>Keelung Ships Gather, Coal Loading Difficulties in Taiwan</h3>
<p>Fuel in this city has been extremely scarce for several months. The stock of diesel is low, and the authorities are allocating it to factories, temporarily reducing supply by 20%. To solve the coal shortage, the Central Coal Allocation Office plans to ship 88,000 tons of coal to Shanghai this month, including 66,000 tons of Taiwanese coal, with the remainder being Soviet and American coal. As of now, no Taiwanese coal has arrived in Shanghai. This is due to the congestion of ships in export ports such as Keelung in Taiwan, making loading and unloading difficult, and the grounding of ships due to workers demanding adjustments to the porterage fees.</p>
<p>It is also learned that if all 66,000 tons arrive this month, the allocation method will be: (1) 32,000 tons for public utilities, and (2) 24,000 tons for factories, power companies, and other users.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Woolen fabric sales have become quiet at the end of the lunar year, but prices have risen. Yesterday, a piece of presentable fancy woolen robe material was generally priced at over 5,000 yuan. A complete set of Western-style clothing was priced at around 7,000 yuan. Printed cotton lining silk was wholesaled at 100 yuan per yard, German salt-grey soft lining at 50 yuan, waterproof cloth at 160 yuan, and Weiyi overcoat woolen fabric at 1,900 yuan.</p>
<h3>National Bank Organizes Emergency Salt Loans</h3>
<p>The Huai salt production areas have successively fallen, and Sichuan salt is again in a state of suspension. In order to regulate military and civilian food needs, the government has decided to implement emergency salt loans. The Central Bank's rediscount committee is drafting the measures. This emergency salt loan is mainly for rushing shipments of Taiwanese and Qingdao salt, and for restoring and increasing Sichuan salt production. The total loan amount is 40 million yuan. 20 million yuan is for rushing shipments of Taiwanese and Qingdao salt, and another 20 million yuan is for Sichuan salt production expenses. The task of rushing shipments of Taiwanese and Qingdao salt will be entrusted to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for lending, with a target of shipping 500,000 piculs, with a loan of 40 yuan per picul. However, the current salt price is actually around 300 yuan per picul, which is far from the actual needs. Moreover, due to transportation difficulties and poor logistics, salt merchants are unwilling to use these loans to avoid taking risks and suffering unexpected losses.</p>
<h3>Machine-Made Nail Industry: Production and Sales Decline Sharply Daily</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Industrial Association, the current situation of the machine-made nail industry in this city is as follows:</p>
<p>Initially, there were only three companies: China, Wufu, and Gongjin. Currently, there are more than 70 member factories. The main products of each factory are 1-inch to 3-inch round nails and 18-gauge to 8-gauge iron wire. Other major products include shoe nails, galvanized iron wire, machine screws, wood screws, and barbed wire. Currently, the main equipment of each factory includes 700 nail-making machines, 880 wire-drawing machines, 178 shoe nail machines, 235 wood screw machines, 35 machine screw machines, 58 galvanized iron wire machines, 11 barbed wire machines, 492 electric motors, and 5 generators. The main raw materials required for the nail-making industry are iron wire and wire rod. However, the raw materials required for galvanized iron wire, in addition to wire rod, also require an average of 10 jin of zinc ingots per picul of finished product. In the past, the domestic production of iron wire and wire rod was extremely low, relying entirely on foreign supplies. Currently, the monthly production of the No. 2 factory of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company can reach more than 800 tons, and the monthly production of wire rod by the other 20 iron and steel factories is also more than 1,000 tons. Wood screws and machine screws are divided into steel and iron types, and each gross requires an average of about 5 jin of wire rod and steel wire. At its peak, the total output of each factory could reach 100,000 barrels of round nails, 20,000 boxes of shoe nails, 20,000 piculs of iron wire, 20,000 piculs of galvanized iron wire, 40,000 gross of machine screws, 220,000 gross of wood screws, and 30,000 rolls of barbed wire per month. In addition to supplying this city and the whole country, 40% could be sold to Southeast Asia. Currently, due to price fluctuations, high wages, and difficulties in importing raw materials, costs have increased sharply. At the same time, industry and commerce are generally shrinking, and people's purchasing power is weak. Production and sales are declining sharply every day, and the future of the industry is not optimistic.</p>

<h3>New Equipment for Basketball League: Electric Scorer Completed, Scoring Fully Electrically Controlled, To Be Used in This League</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The fourth basketball league will open next week. The floor of the city stadium has been repaired and completely repainted. In terms of lighting, 21 strong spotlights have also been newly added, entrusted to the Experimental Film Studio for installation, and the hot water showers have also been installed. Among them, the most important new equipment is the completion of the basketball electric scorer. The scorer includes three parts: electric scoring, electric timing, and electric lighting. It is fully electrically controlled, requiring only one person to manage, completely eliminating the past manual scoring and manual timing, and is extremely accurate, which is a major creation and innovation in Chinese sports equipment. The design of the scorer was conceived by Qian Xucang, chairman of the Shanghai City Sports Association Basketball Committee, and fully refined with the assistance of the LB Laboratory (i.e., Li Brothers Laboratory) in this city. In the past, Mr. Qian made many innovations to basketball equipment in this city, and created a jumping basketball timer, which was adopted in the basketball finals of the 7th National Games, with excellent results. Last autumn, he went to England to visit the World Games, and also traveled to the United States for study and investigation, gaining more insights into basketball. The completion of this electric scorer can be said to be a great success. The manufacturing cost of the machine is very high, and it was jointly donated by the enthusiastic Zhengtai Rubber Factory and ABC Candy Company. The contents of the machine are as follows: (1) Scoring section - the letters are clear, controlled by electric buttons, and no longer need to be manually turned over. (2) Timing section - made of a giant electric clock, with white characters on a black background, the minute hand rotates once every 20 minutes (i.e., half of the A-level game time), the second hand still rotates once every 60 seconds, and is calculated by countdown, the position where the clock hand stops is the remaining time of the game for quick observation. (3) Lighting section - specially installed on the inner edge of the electric clock, the light is not dazzling, the clock face emits red light when paused, and the clock face emits green light when running. This kind of light can represent signals and also make the clock face clear. Other indications such as the upper and lower halves are also clearly displayed on the machine.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Football Match: Qingbai Lineup Subpar, Huaguang Wins by Four Goals</h3>
<p>The Huaguang team, with its tireless efforts, quick actions, and delicate cooperation, overwhelmed the Qingbai team by four to zero yesterday, winning enthusiastic support from over a thousand spectators in the entire stadium. This is a surprising feat in this season's Nanshi League. Qingbai's unprecedented beating, rather than being attributed to complacency, is better described as hitting an unlucky time. Any strong team is bound to suffer one or two unexpected setbacks in its development process. Even the experienced Meng Yiliang could only shake his head and vent his frustration yesterday. The poor Qingbai lineup was the biggest reason for the disastrous defeat.</p>
<p>Match Overview</p>
<p>The entire Huaguang team played well. The forward line was impeccable, and the defense line had few mistakes. Wu Qiqi, in the center, was the most hardworking and meritorious, providing supplies and taking care of the defense. Chen Huimin's goalkeeping and the left and right wings, Zhu Jiaheng and Shang Shiqi, were also outstanding talents. As for Qingbai, encountering an unlucky time, their footwork was naturally mostly unfavorable, which can be put aside.</p>
<p>At 3:10, Qingbai kicked off. The ball was intercepted by Huaguang, and right wing Shang Shiqi advanced along the side and hooked the ball, which was immediately shot in by Qian Yunqing, less than a minute after the start of the game. Qingbai's counterattack was ineffective, and Huaguang was active again, but all were blocked by Qingbai's defense line. The two sides held each other in stalemate for over 20 minutes. Both sides played many exciting moments, and cheers were endless. At 24 minutes, Huaguang launched an attack on the left, and Zhu Jiaheng's long shot was again successful. This ball was more urgent and powerful than the first, and even more beautiful. In less than four minutes, Wu Qixiang took the lead and went to the front line to shoot, unexpectedly breaking through the goal and creating an absolute advantage of three to zero.</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Qingbai tried hard to take the offensive in order to recover, but unfortunately, they were too hasty, and their shots often went against their wishes. In a short while, Huaguang's forward line was like a dragon and a tiger, frequently advancing into Qingbai's hinterland. At 13 minutes, Huaguang's Zhu Jiaheng launched a rebellion on the border, dribbling the ball and dashing forward, deceiving Jiang Zhenning and shooting from 25 yards away. The ball was high and powerful, and it penetrated the net from the upper right corner of the goal near the crossbar, extremely beautiful. Chen Keming had no other choice but to watch it go in. Huaguang won a total of four goals. At this point, Qingbai really felt that they could not turn the tide. Even in the last ten minutes, Meng Yiliang went forward alone, chasing the ball. The opponent's defender had already been deceived, and even goalkeeper Chen Huimin had left his position, leaving an empty goal waiting to kiss Meng Yiliang. But he kicked a high ball, which crossed the fence and went wild. What is this if not fate? As a result, four to zero, Qingbai retreated. The lineups of the two armies are listed below.</p>
<p>Huaguang</p>
<p>Chen Huimin</p>
<p>Le Dequan, Lu Qitang</p>

<h3>The Road to Construction in Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>— This newspaper reporter, Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Chengdu, 10th (airmail)] The construction projects in Sichuan today can generally include the following: namely, railways, industry and mining, highways, and rural areas. Each has active construction plans and practices. The current status of what has been explored is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Tianshui-Chengdu Railway to Start Construction Soon</p>
<p>The Tianshui-Chengdu Railway has been surveyed by the Ministry of Transportation Engineering Team for half a year and is now completed. The entire route starts 30 miles west of Tianshui, passes through Mudandong, Yanguan, Lianghekou, and follows the Jialing River to Guangyuan, Jiangyou, Mianyang, and Guanghan to Chengdu. The project cost has been budgeted by the Ministry of Communications and will request a portion of the U.S. aid for subsidies. Construction will begin this month.</p>
<p>Developing Industry and Mining, Dividing into Four Zones</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Government, in order to develop industry and mining, has recently divided the entire province into four mining areas and is actively engaged in development. They are: (1) the Weiyuan area, including 15 counties in Zigong, Leshan, and Zizhong; (2) the Luxian area, including 14 counties in Ningbin, Jiangjin, and Nanxi; (3) the Chongqing area, including 23 counties in Jiangbei, Nanguang, and Tongliang; (4) the Wanxian area, including 17 counties in Yunchang, Chengkou, and Wuxi. Actively develop special products separately.</p>
<p>Chengdu-Chongqing Railway: Project Commences</p>
<p>The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was previously stalled due to the completion of the appropriation of funds. The Yuyong section must wait until the flood season next spring before all the equipment purchased in the United States arrives before the track-laying project can begin. The Yutong section is currently actively carrying out earthwork engineering. If no obstacles occur along the way, the entire line should be open to traffic in July next year.</p>
<p>Revitalizing Rural Areas, Developing Special Products</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Government, in order to revitalize the rural areas of Sichuan and develop special products, has recently proposed a new rural construction plan for Sichuan, deciding on three principles: (1) In the first phase, promote miscellaneous grains in the western Sichuan Plain, Jianyang American tobacco, Santai cotton, Leshan white wax, Zinei sugar, Kai County tung oil, and Sichuan lovage, angelica, fritillary, and other medicinal materials in Shizhu and other counties. (2) Establish the Sichuan Rural Revitalization Committee. (3) Raise funds according to the U.S. aid percentage of 65%, the central government 15%, and the local 20%.</p>
<p>Three Major Highways: Emergency Repairs</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Government, in order to protect Sichuan's defense, is urgently repairing three major national defense highways. The construction progress is as follows: (1) Mianlue Highway. After emergency repairs, the entire road has been barely opened to traffic. Basic permanent engineering is being undertaken by the Sichuan Highway Bureau, which is mobilizing civil workers for construction. After the Chongqing-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters sent an inspection team to supervise the repairs, it has requested the central government to subsidize funds and complete the entire road within a time limit. (2) Chengdu-Bazhong Highway. Step up emergency repairs. Each county along the road, Jintang, Yilong, and Bazhong, mobilize hundreds of thousands of civil workers to work day and night. If the basic engineering costs subsidized by the central government are quickly allocated in the short term, the entire road can be completed as scheduled. (3) Dachuan-Guang'an Highway.

The roadbed has been completed long ago. The Ministry of Transportation is currently ordering a large number of steel rails, steel frames, and other materials in the United States for the resumption of the road. The required sleepers will be purchased locally in Sichuan and Yunnan. The start of construction is near. The Ministry of Transportation has telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Government to request assistance.</p>
<h3>Details of the Natong "Mix Rice and Hoard" Case</h3>
<p>— This newspaper reporter, Cong Yongshu</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nantong, 10th] Ever since Nantong's rice became inextricably linked to cotton yarn, the common people have been complaining. The current ratio of rice to yarn is as follows: one picul of good white rice can be exchanged for two and a half small bags of Hongkui yarn of 20 counts produced by Dasheng Yarn Factory, and a slightly inferior grade can also be exchanged for two small bags. As a result, the yarn rose, and the rice also rose. However, when the yarn fell, the rice stood still. The rice price rigidly stipulated in the economic meeting of the Command Headquarters Economic Office on New Year's Eve has long become a dead letter. Rice is an indispensable food, and such a crazy price increase directly threatens people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Rice Store Doors Blown Open</p>
<p>Under this situation, the "mixing rice and hoarding" incident occurred successively in Tangzha Town, northwest of the county seat. The process of the matter is as follows: a small number of workers at the Dasheng Yarn Factory had a conflict with rice merchants over buying rice. The next day, at 6 o'clock in the morning on the 9th, when the night shift workers were dismissed, the workers gathered and blew open the rice store, mixing various foods: rice, wheat, soybeans, flour, etc. together. In the chaos, there were also incidents of destroying business equipment. The extension lasted about two or three hours before it subsided. As a result, Zhen Tai, Heng Yi Gong, and other two companies suffered long losses, and one female worker was injured at the time.</p>
<p>Tragic Event Reenacted</p>
<p>At 6 o'clock in the morning on the 10th, the "mixing rice and hoarding" incident was reenacted. The situation was even more expanded than before. This time, several companies had their doors blown open, including Daxinglong, Zhentai, Wanfengde, Dingtai, Hengyigong, etc. Because some grain stores also operated oil businesses, Dingtai and Hengyigong were oil and rice factories, so rice was mixed with wheat, wheat was mixed with flour, the old drama was repeated, and the new trick was to immerse flour, rice, and cotton yarn in oil tanks. A business on the upper floor hoarded about three boxes of cotton yarn, which was also thrown from the upper floor to the center of the street in small bags. The agitators on the road also broke up the small bags and threw them into the air, so the eaves and wires were covered with scattered cotton yarn. A part of the people also broke into the oil workshop, destroying the machines, and the furniture of the other three families was also destroyed in the same way, completely dismantled.</p>
<p>Squad Leader Zhang Hit</p>
<p>At this time, the situation was extremely chaotic. The Self-Defense Force fired warning shots, but the agitators rushed towards the team members, and under the combined force of fists and feet, a Mauser pistol was lost. The team members shouted, "There is no gun, what are you still fighting for?" Zhang, the squad leader of the Self-Defense Force, was unable to maintain order. During the commotion, a rioter hit him on the head with a stick, breaking his skull and immediately fainting. He was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. Gu Yuanru, the director of the Tangzha Construction Experimental Zone, rushed to the scene of the incident to persuade him, but was wiped on the nose several times by the rioting crowd in the chaos and was unable to speak. The riot on the 10th started at 6 am and did not completely subside until noon. In addition to some Dasheng workers, a small number of pedestrians also participated in the mixing and hoarding.</p>
<p>Avoid Reoccurring Incidents</p>
<p>After the incident, the Tangzha Experimental Zone Office, the police branch, and the Dasheng Trade Union held a meeting to persuade the workers to resolve the matter. At the same time, the Grain and Vegetable Guild also held a meeting to change the rice price. Some said that when the workers bought rice, the first batch was quoted at 2,800 yuan per picul, but when the second batch arrived, the quote reached 3,200 yuan per picul, with a very short interval, but the price difference was huge, causing the workers to be indignant and take this action. However, the person in charge of the Grain Association said that there was no such high price. On the 9th, the Tangzha Grain Market quoted 2,400 yuan per picul for white rice and 2,000 yuan per picul for Xian rice. On the 10th, in order to avoid reoccurring incidents, they reduced the price by 100 yuan each, with white rice at 2,300 yuan and Xian rice at 1,900 yuan.</p>
<p>However, the aftermath of this "hoarding" case is still under consideration, but Zhang, the squad leader of the Self-Defense Force who was beaten, died of his injuries in the afternoon!</p>

<h3>Famous Scholar, Good Principal: Zhu Kezhen Takes on a Heavy Burden</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 8th] Zhejiang University is often considered one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the country. I have chatted with many professors and students at the university, and they all unanimously admire their principal. Principal Zhu Kezhen is an academician of the Academia Sinica, a renowned meteorologist, short in stature, and of a lean appearance.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Zhu Kezhen led thousands of students from Zhejiang across mountains and rivers to the remote southwestern rear area. In Zunyi, Guizhou, with its overlapping mountains and rugged roads, he endured hardship and set an example, sharing joys and sorrows with professors and students. Although the school buildings were dilapidated and the clothes were tattered, "Zhejiang University" still maintained unparalleled brilliance.</p>
<p>When in Zunyi, Mr. Zhu, in addition to handling school administration, often chatted with the students in his spare time, asking about their studies, asking about their lives, and sometimes chatting with the school workers and doormen about their families. Although they spent their hard years during the war, they were greatly encouraged in spirit by Mr. Zhu's concern.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu is not interested in politics. On the contrary, he particularly respects cultural workers. I remember during the Qiannan Incident, when cultural figures were evacuated from Guiyang, via Zunyi, to Chongqing, he always personally visited their residences and helped solve their food and accommodation problems. He also invited them to give speeches to the students and held banquets to entertain them, even in impoverished conditions.</p>
<p>He runs education from the standpoint of a pure scholar, treating the university as an academic research institution. With "scholarship" as the primary premise, the students of Zunyi "Zhejiang University" sought their truths in books and laboratories. The students' nearsightedness increased, and so did the reputation of Zhejiang University.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, Mr. Zhu led them again across mountains and rivers, adding to the beautiful scenery of Hangzhou. He still often chats with the students, and still chats with the school workers and doormen about their families. However, constant warfare and the difficulty of running the school make this person who runs education from the standpoint of a pure scholar feel unprecedentedly thorny due to worries about the times and affairs.</p>
<p>Scholarship is about questioning, and scholarship is vast. Therefore, the attitude of scholars is sincere and generous. Precisely because of this, the government blames him for favoritism, and the students blame him for weakness. He once told me, "I don't understand politics, and I don't know how to engage in politics. It makes me very difficult now, so I really want to resign." The students are finally naive. From wall newspapers, speeches, and even actions, they all earnestly retain their "good principal"! He was moved to tears by the familiarity of these thousands of students. He re-shouldered this difficult burden and led the students forward!</p>
<p>After the Huaihai Campaign, schools in Nanjing suspended classes invisibly, and universities in Shanghai started their holidays early. In Peiping and Tianjin, after the "deserter" Hu Shi flew to Beijing, it is unknown how these thousands of outstanding talents are struggling in the flames of war. With the same nostalgia and the same feelings, I went to "Zhejiang University" for a stroll on a morning with a temperature of four degrees below zero and a biting cold wind.</p>
<p>Principal Zhu received me in his office. He was wearing a well-worn woolen coat. He was studying a certain subject. With a sad feeling, he told me, "Recently, the school's financial situation has become worse, and we can't even afford to light a fire." He continued, "The average salary of professors is only 700 Gold Yuan per person, which, according to today's (January 8th) market price, can only buy one dan of rice. If a professor has a wife and two children, how can they survive? It seems that prices will continue to rise! Fortunately, Chairman Chen of Zhejiang Province provides seven dou of rice to university professors, so we can barely maintain. However, under these circumstances, we are very concerned about whether Chairman Chen can continue to provide rations? The school's total office expenses are only 12,000 Gold Yuan. The electricity bill for November was 120,000 Gold Yuan, and the bill for December will probably be even higher. How can the school administration be maintained?"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu has many feelings about national affairs: "Since India was recognized as independent by Britain, there have been internal rifts. However, they have already canceled their antagonistic attitudes. Recently, they convened an Asian conference in New Delhi to discuss the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. Aren't the suffering of our Chinese professors and the suffering of the people all caused by the civil war?"</p>
<p>I then asked him about contingency plans, and he said, "We have not suspended classes due to the tense situation. We plan to start the final exams in mid-January, followed by a three-week winter vacation. Students who fail will have to take make-up exams, which will probably take two weeks. Therefore, excellent students can have a three-week break, while students who fail will only have a one-week break. The school has no plans to move. The Ministry of Education has not given instructions, and moving the school is not an easy task."</p>
<p>Of course, it is clear from this conversation with him that his burden is even heavier. But I also have a new impression of him, which is that he does not compromise in the face of difficulties, and he hates war. In fact, all true scholars are probably like that!</p>
