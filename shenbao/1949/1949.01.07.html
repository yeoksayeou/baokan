<h3>李宗仁張治中邵力子等　研商走向和談途徑　白崇禧邀張羣赴漢禮察</h3>
<p>〔本報南京大日電〕總統呼籲和平之文吿發表後，共黨雖迄今未有正式反應發表，但政府方面若干爲和平而奔走之要員如副總統李宗仁，政委張治中·張羣及國策顧問邵力子等，均日有接觸，共商走向和談之途，而達和平之目的。彼等研究之辦法及努力之程度究已達何項階段，尚無法探悉，惟相信彼等必正研究一具體之辦法中，此項辦法或須待共黨正式反應發表後，始有實施之望。首都若干方面六日已獲悉新華社記者對總統文吿之評諭，該評論雖直接加以批評，然其純粹宣傳式之口吻，殆難視作中共當局之正式答覆，六日此間各方仍在期待中。政府發言人沈昌煥，六日答覆記者詢問時亦稱，政府迄今尚未接獲共黨方面對蔣總統文吿之正式或非正式的答覆。至國際調處問題，顯亦爲注意中心，惟京中美·蘇兩方人士力持緘默熊度。某記者曾詢問沈昌煥是否有政府官吏曾請求美·蘇·英·法四國或其中任何一國出面調處，沈氏之答覆爲：「就本人所知，並無任何政府官吏曾作此種接洽」。旋詢以是否有私人作此種接洽，沈氏則稱，渠無完備之情報網足以獲知此種私人行動。據沈氏之答覆視之，政府殆尚朱派員向國際友人有所接洽，此或爲可能之第二步驟，惟亦須等待共黨之反應，始能決定淮行與否。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕白祟禧邇來就時局問題，與京中部份人士利用長途電話密切聯絡，經常保持接洽者爲李副總統，白氏五日曾與在京之張羣通電話，請其赴漢一行，聞白氏之用意係欲請張氏觀察實情後，而釋一般人士對渠之懷疑，至張氏是否卽往，聞尚在考慮中。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平六日電〕此問一般人士咸信，一九四九年將爲中國之和平年，僅最悲觀者認爲須遲至六月以後方能實現，但亦無人敢謂其母需經過重大困難。在蔣總統元旦文吿之建議演變爲全面和平以前，當有許多必經程序，目前尚在各地公共團體通電擁護和平運動及勸吿中共領袖毛澤東下令停戰時期。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約六日電〕紐約時報六日社論稱：雖則蔣總統之和平條件已爲共產黨拒絕，但此項和平條件僅係蔣總統之第一次開價，而共產黨之拒絕，僅係共黨宣傳機構所傳出者，並非出自中共領袖本人，因此國共之談判及妥協之餘地甚大。該社評結論稱：目前和平，在於共產黨是否能聽從人民所要求之和平。</p>

<h3>中委劉建緒談　爭取和平觀感</h3>
<p>〔中央社長沙六日電〕中委劉建緒發表對爭取和平觀感，略謂：總統元且文吿，已開啓和平之門，不獨國民甚爲欣忭，卽國際友人亦當以中國行將結束苦難之命運而寄予無限期望。歷史上無不和之戰爭，就人道而言，自相殘殺之悲劇，尤應卽日停止，國共曾有兩度合作之歷史，勝利後，且有共同簽訂和平建國綱領，今雖時勢變遷，但三民主義之基本原則，仍適用於中國，雙方但能根據此基本原則，開誠布公妥商條件，斷無不可和平之理。吾人今日所期望者，不僅爲公平永久之和平，且望人人能深自檢討，從新做起，實現三民主義，爲子孫萬世造福，以補今日之創傷</p>
<h3>國民黨中當會　討論改革方案</h3>

<p>〔本報台北六日電〕陳主席今整日在省府辦公，與各應長個別談話，衆所關心之人事問題迄無眉目，陳接事時僅携副官數人。</p>
<h3>化裝平民突出重團　孫元良脫險抵漢　備嘗艱苦歷廿九日始達信陽　由張軫陪同到漢謁白總司令</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口六日電〕第十六兵團司令官孫元良，三日脫險安抵信陽，五日晚由豫主席張軫陪同自信抵漢，當卽偕往剿總，晋謁白總司令，報吿脫險經過，并參加剿總晚宴，至晚十一時始辭去，故外間知者甚少。本報記者今晨訪孫氏於旅邸，孫氏着新製軍服，體態略現勞頓，而精神倍形健旺。據談：該兵團在上月初被陳毅之兩廣縱隊等部包圍後，補給發生嚴重困難，士兵戰鬥意志雖強，而果腹無方，只得捕殺牲畜充飢，全軍戰馬幾已煮食殆盡，部分士兵且已餓斃，如此枵腹應戰達三數日，共軍受創頗重，卒以彈盡援絕，軍心無法控制，不免零星逃散。本人見勢已無可作爲，只得於上月七日，自皖北永城陣地化裝平民，突出重圍，除親率官兵千餘人已安抵豫南外，其餘部屬亦大部已向有利地區集中，刻正準備繼續努力。余係取道河南黃泛區，輾轉經許昌抵信陽，歷時凡二十九日，直至三日晨九時，始在信陽重見我方袍澤，刻正電京報吿，一俟獲復，卽將飛京請示。言畢，閣者吿以車巳備妥，孫氏卽謂記者曰，刻須赴剿總，回頭再談。</p>
<p>又據張軫主席談，孫將軍此次脫險，備嘗艱苦，當其甫抵信陽時，身着便衣，滿臉髭鬚。先與五綏區襲參謀長通話，當卽派車迎入城中，與余（張自稱）晤面，并由余贈款五千元，以供換製新裝之需。抵漢後，白總司令以孫氏英勇堅貞，曾代表中央深致嘉慰云。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕孫元良將軍脫險抵信陽轉往漢口之消息，六日經國防部發言人鄧文儀證實。鄧氏稱：孫氏係率部突圍其部隊已到達安全地區。</p>
<h3>魯蕩平蔣當翊等　抵漢謁白總司令</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口六日電〕中委魯蕩平，偕湘省紳耆朱文瑩，於昨晚自湘抵漢。兩氏今晨同赴剿總，訪謁白總司令，并在白氏官邸共進午餐，新近抵漢之孫元良將軍及張軫主席均在座。又，某軍軍畏蔣當翊，六日亦自湘抵漢。</p>
<h3>鄧文儀正式證實　劉伯承確被炸斃　另有匪軍將領五人同死</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕共匪「中原解放軍」司令員劉伯承，於指揮淮北之戰時，被空軍炸斃之說，六日復經國防部發言人鄧文儀正式證實。鄧氏於招待記者時宣布：劉伯承係於上月十三日上午在皖北桃園舖被空軍B24機羣密集轟炸時炸死，當時劉係指揮匪軍攻雙堆集之黃維兵團，與其他高級將領五人，分乘小汽車一輛，吉普軍二輛，赴前綫指揮，被炸彈命中，該將領五人均當塲炸斃，惟尚未查明其姓名，劉係炸斷一腿，腹部受傷，於運回途中斃命；睢溪口宿縣鄭州等地匪曾於十八日開會追悼，鄭州偽中州鎮行所發行之鈔票因之大爲跌價。劉之死訊業經軍方情報，匪俘供詞及當地民衆口述予以證實，劉屍係由匪軍出麥三十担購得棺材一口，埋於桃園集東北之東平集。鄧氏又稱：「劉匪斃命後，其部隊由其部屬陳賡統率，因劉伯承之死，盤踞華中之匪，因領導無人，軍事顯已因此而暫取守勢，蓋劉伯承爲匪軍中卓越之軍事首領，從軍已卅餘年，曾在蘇聯及德國受軍事訓練，作戰素以詭詐著稱。」（按陳賡與鄧文儀於廿五年以前係黃埔軍校仝窗）。</p>

<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕駐華美海軍陸戰隊之計劃，官方仍守秘密，但其準備撤退之證據已漸增，一般人認爲正式聲明當由美國務院發表。聯合社記者自靑島來電稱：陸戰隊正在忽想東裝，惟西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾，對本月四日所稱美軍並不自中國撤退一節，拒絕加以闡釋。山東大學將於廿五日交還學校當易，駐校美軍三千人當返歸艦上，一部份殆將復叵關島。</p>
<p>〔本報青島六日電〕山大校長趙太侔，參議會議長李代芳，立委崔士傑今午在國際俱樂部宴請西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾及陸戰隊司令湯姆斯，對美海軍及陸戰隊過去予青島市之惠助表示感謝之忱，劉安祺龔學遂等首長均被邀參加。又美西太平洋軍中廣播電台刻暫停播音。</p>
<h3>張羣勱縱論時局　主先採兩項步驟打開和談之門　鼓募中間勢力從事折衝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨主席張君勱昨日縱論時局，謂和談恢復匪易，目前有兩項步驟，應先予採取，以打開和談之門。一爲開放言禁，蓋自戡亂以來，凡有主和言論，卽犯禁律，使有心人雖欲盡力，亦無從着手。今日政府旣已誠意覓取和平，此種禁律應卽日取消，使各界有心努力和平之人士得以軍振陣營，構成中間勢力，折衝於兩黨之間，和平方有希望。二爲須恢復與中共保持接觸之若干「路綫」，使對方之眞正意向得以明瞭，例如張東蓀最近表示願南下斡旋，政府應予以鼓勵。關於中共對和平之誠意問題，張氏認爲中共內部對和戰可能意見不一致，故對總統文吿無正式答覆。但中共爲一與世界政治有密切關係之政黨，其行動自有分寸。且審時度勢，雖在軍事上目前暫佔上風，但尚無席捲全國之實力，故亦可能適可而止。以中共諸領袖而論，張氏堅信周恩來，董必武等，乃傾向和平，而能顧到國家利害者。至於四國調停之說，張氏謂，去秋在美時，巳聞有人從中策動，但未得要領。至於由聯合國調解之議，是否能見諸實行，胥視我國之內部事件是否構成國際爭端而定，固然，印·回戰事由聯合國調處，但印度與巴基斯坦確爲兩個國家，與我國目前之情形逈異，故由聯合國出面解決之希望至微。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕靑年黨中常委夏濤聲，昨日下午曾訪張君動氏，就和平問題交換意見。</p>

<h3>一週戰況簡述　國防部發表</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕國防部頃發表三十七年十二月三十日至三十八年一月五日一週戰況如次：本週因氣候嚴寒，全國各戰塲均無劇烈戰事，惟國軍空軍和砲兵，則均曾發揮威力予匪以電大殺傷，茲將各地戰況簡述於左：</p>
<p>（一）平津方面　週來匪軍正調整部署，無大戰鬥，林匪主力三分之二，約八個縱隊，巳集中天津週圍，最近戰事重點或將移至津郊。北平方面：　榮臻匪部主力，正陸續由平綏平漢綫向北平四週調動。林匪部隊僅有第五，第十一兩縱隊，仍留古郊，邇來無重要戰鬥。塘大國軍，連日出擊，頗多斬獲。據前方報導，匪第九縱隊司令員詹才芳，曾於三十日上午，在西大沽以西大梁子地方，召集幹部會議，適被我艦砲猛擊命中，匪高級幹部傷亡甚多，現巳證實者，有匪九縱隊二十五師師長曾離諛，參謀長率子鈞，政委江洪海，二十六師師長　金禮，參謀長吳文華，政委李振春等人，刻正繼續搜尋屍體中。</p>
<p>（二）太原方面　盤踞并坦外團之匪，以師老無功，戰意極爲消沉，國軍乘匪疲憊，當於新正向匪展開局部攻勢，在殷家堡，後將，干家峯，黑駝以及白家莊以南地區，曾先後斃匪八百餘名，並摧毀匪工事數十處。太原國軍，刻愈戰愈強，週邊匪軍，已不敢冒險進犯。大同國軍，週來亦向四週展開搜剿，先後斃匪七百餘，刻大同外圍四十里以內，已無匪踪。</p>
<p>（三）江淮方面自宿蚌會戰吿一段落後，國軍卽在淮河沿岸，作堅強部署，陳劉匪部，以受創奇重，目前猶無力向南進犯，刻劉匪各縱隊在宿縣南北地膩喘息整補，陳匪大部在　溪口西北，與我杜聿明兵團相持，國軍糧彈不缺，士氣甚旺，而匪軍則飢寒交迫，極爲困苦，現陳匪各縱隊，僅憑縱深工事，圖阻我軍南下，週來除零星接觸外，無大戰鬥。流竄在洪澤湖畔盱眙天長一帶之陳匪新二縱隊，連日被國軍痛剿，死傷千餘人，刻殘匪已向東北方向逃竄，國軍前日已進駐天長。</p>
<p>此外，華中西北各戰塲，週內均甚平靜，竄踞樊城之劉匪第十縱隊，及孔從周匪部，被我擊潰後，刻已向向垠鎮等地逸去，匪向襄樊地區進擾的計劃，已被我軍粉碎。</p>
<p>自總統元且文吿發表，向匪號召和平，週來匪軍下級幹部，及士兵之厭戰情緒，較前更爲高漲，如匪首們猶不悟過自贖，停止叛亂，則其部下自動停戰之日，終將到來，國人可拭目俟之。</p>

<p>評論</p>
<h3>新疆的新曙光</h3>
<p>當前的邊政，以新疆問題最爲人注意，而新疆局勢的演變和發展，亦最與國內大局有關。年來新驟問題日趨複雜，民族宗教政活國際諸因素，錯綜交織，發生了多次的變亂，多次的紛爭，尤其在白塔山事件發生以來，新疆局勢頓趨嚴重。由於西北行政長官張治中將軍的忍耐應變，和新疆省主席麥斯武德沉著應付，新疆一時的戾氣轉化爲祥和，西北局勢因而賴以穩定。最近中央政府爲調和新疆內部意見，促進新疆民族的團結，派任飽爾漢爲新疆省政府委昌兼主席，穆罕默德伊敏最副主席，劉孟純兼省府秘書長。前任主席麥斯武德，秘書長艾沙免職另候任用，前任委員兼副主席阿不都克力木漢買合素木免兼職。飽爾漢伊敏現在迪化，已表示接受新命，劉孟純亦抵迪佈署一切，并與蘇聯駐迪總領專有所洽談。這說明新疆行政的重大改變，它將爲我國和平團結前途，帶來新的曙光。</p>
<p>新疆局勢是複雜迷離的，特別是在伊　塔城阿山三區特殊化，少數分裂派不斷製造民族分裂以來，新疆局勢是日益動盪不安。麥斯武德的出任新疆主席，不僅未能和緩新疆民族內部的矛盾，相反的，予伊犁分裂派種種的口實。去歲阿山區的變亂和白塔山事件，便是分裂派反抗　　武德的　計劃策動。在此紛亂的局面下，張治中麥斯武德兩氏應變的態度，是開誠心布公道，以寬容求民族宗教上的諒解，以開明求政治國際上的和緩，祇要看新疆省府對伊犁三區的按兵不動，張治中多次致函分裂派曉以大義的種種事實表現，即知政府開明與寬容的政策，是逐漸成功了，且收效宏著。</p>
<p>第一件表現於事實的，即新籍國府委員飽爾漢與新省建設廳長伊敏的南下述職，表示維族的誠心內向。飽　漢爲維族賢達，早年留學歐洲，著作豐富，在新疆各族中頗著威望，即伊犁分裂派人物亦對之景從。鮑爾漢與伊敏，從新疆帶來的新疆歌舞團，曾經載譽京滬各地，其團結歌聲的洋溢，迄今尚使內地人士眷戀不忘。他們并且從新疆帶來一新疆建設五年計劃」，請中央暨各方人士，予以財力人力之援助，深獲朝野人士的贊助與同情。其次表現於事實的，即新疆各縣參議會的選舉成立，及各縣市暨行政專員區的地方行政官選舉，維族哈薩族等均一致熱烈參加，麥斯武德一秉公正原則，謹慎指導全省的選舉事宜，深獲全省人士的好感。這件事表徵新疆多數民族多數宗教人民，擁護國策，擁護中央，更說明錯綜紛亂的新疆，在中央忍耐的堅定的決心領導下，政治走向民主，民族走向　結，終於能夠獲得安定的因素。此乃新疆政治一年以來的重大成就，爲新疆爲西北奠立了和平幸福的基礎。</p>
<p>這次中央任命鮑　漢伊敏主新，并以張治中將軍的智囊劉孟純襄助新省省政，這說明中央對新疆和平團結前途，有了更進一步的努力和重視。第一，鮑爾漢伊敏對於新疆的經濟建設，是有決心有計劃的。今日新疆的重大問題，仍爲經濟問題，資源蘊藏未開發，人民財富及所得無由增加，理想的生活水準更無從建立，如果民生主羲的建設能在新疆成功，則新疆的安定是有裨益於民族國家前途的，第二，飽爾漢在新省具有威望，其人治事治學，光明磊落，且無任何黨派背景，深爲新疆各族人民所擁護。此次鮑氏膺此新命，一般反響良好，飽氏在迪化閒適生活中，亦表示「新疆前途至爲樂觀」，足徵伊犁三區的對立僵局，不久可望打開，飽氏對於新疆各族的和平團結是成竹在胸的。基於這兩點，我們應預爲新疆光明的前途慶，并預爲國家統一團結的前途慶</p>
<p>總之，新疆問題已逐漸開朗，政治走向民主，經濟走向建設，必有助新疆局勢的穩定。新疆的穩定，自然會消除內涵矛盾與外圍的誘力，道一切有待於飽爾漢諸氏的努力了。我們一方面爲新疆光明的前途慶，同時更要呼喚伊犁塔城阿山少數分裂派的警覺，新疆和平團結之門已開啟，應該迅速回復理智，返歸和平團結之路！</p>
<h3>新世界大戰危機日增　中國將為主要戰塲　經過長期掙扎西方國家可獲勝　合眾社記者房恩之報道</h3>
<p>〔合衆社遠東分社社長房恩東京六日電〕中國共產黨軍隊之征服東北華北之大部份，已使西太平洋及亞洲東部之整個戰略情況爲之一燮。此兩個區域中之非共產黨軍人及政治家幾皆有同感。</p>
<p>在過去十二個月中，作者訪問之地幾遍及亞洲，並會晤當地領袖與歐美領袖。彼等普遍認爲新世界大戰之導火綫，可能在亞洲爆發之危險性正在增加中。與一九三一—三三年日本征服東北及日本軍閥踏入中國大陸如同一轍之預兆己見端倪。中國共軍及莫斯科對西太平洋區和戰問題之地位，與東京在珍珠港事變所處之地位正復相同。</p>
<p>英美所領導之西方盟國與蘇聯所領導之共產國家間戰爭有明顯之可能性已經可看出。然消息最靈通之觀察家並不相信此一大戰卽將爆發，彼等強調稱：蘇聯在目前並未在準備大戰，可能在數年內不及準備就緒，一般認爲中國將立卽成爲主要戰塲，蘇聯在中國業已贏得第一回合。東北實際上已爲蘇聯之衛星國，外蒙及華北已在趕入蘇聯範圍中。若干有資格之英美觀察家相信，亞洲乃蘇聯在目前「冷戰」中之主要目的。蘇聯在柏林及西歐其他各地中之侵略戰術乃在掩護其他在遠東之眞正主要進攻，一般回憶蘇聯早在一九二四年卽明白表示擬將中國拉入蘇聯集團。</p>
<p>當時蘇聯派遺一龐大之軍事及政治顧問團，以協助孫中山先生之國民革命。彼等復指出中共之領袖卽係當時開始接受共產思想之人物。目前對峙局面之雛形如下。盟國控制日本羣島南迄台灣，沖繩島及菲島，在東南亞洲控制印度及其鄰近之羣島包括荷屬印尼及錫蘭，在緬甸及印尼之民主國家地位並不堅強，英國迄今尚未完全撲滅在馬來亞之共產叛變。蘇聯及其共產盟國現控制西北亞洲中之西伯利亞及可看到阿拉斯加之島嶼，以及千島羣島南迄庫頁島與日本北端僅一水之隔。韓北，東北，外蒙古及華北大部份皆在蘇聯控制下，此外在庫頁島南部前日本基地及新疆兩地中亦有堅強之地位。西方盟國在其所控制之地區中，擁有較強之陸，海，空軍基地，西方盟國可能除去潛水艇外有超優之制海權，制空權亦佔優勢。毫無問題地，蘇聯之陸地力量極佔優勢，可能佔領若千目前西方盟國所佔領之區域，并守住若干時日，此外一蘇聯無原子彈，工業生產力亦遠較西方落後，一般意見僉信若將來發生戰爭，西方國家可獲勝利，但須在經過長期之掙扎，消耗其實力資源之後。</p>

<h3>杜魯門將提特別咨文　闡明美外交政策　我國局勢憂將加以檢討　擴大軍事援外計劃樹立防共壁壘</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕此間外交當局今日宣稱，杜魯門總統大致將在兩星期內，對外交政策發表重要聲明，檢討中國局勢及其給予東太平洋美防禦戰略之影響，此外並將報吿數月以來政府相當關切之印尼與巴勒斯坦兩地情況。該項聲明最遲至太月二十日舉行就任典禮時發表，但亦可能提早，而用特別咨文方式送交國會。總統昨在內政咨文中，僅約略提及外交方面，未來聲明則將闡述國務與國防兩部及經合總署擬訂之整個政策範圍。內有全新計劃二端，尚在起草階段，即參加北大西洋軍事同盟，樹立防共壁壘，直至西歐各國自身力能抵抗蘇聯時爲止，並擴大軍事援外計劃，授權總統供給軍火與西歐各國，藉以加速其整軍工作及畀予充分之安全感。此外，總統料將要求延長援歐復興計劃三年，再行援助希臘與十耳其，並對蘇聯繼續採取堅強立塲。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕杜魯門總統五日在其致國會之首次咨文中，在外交政策方面，渠僅作「杜魯門主義」要點之簡短與理論上聲明。總統允於將來另一咨文內詳述渠之外交政策，本日僅謂：「吾人正在邀行一項外交政策，此項政策爲吾人民主信念之向外表示。吾人正在竭力鼓勵全世界自由國家與自由人民協助國外受苦與遭難者，加強民主國家以抵抗侵略。吾人外交政策之中心在於和平。吾人支持世界組織以維護和平，採取世界經濟政策以促進人類之繁榮，吾人以國際合作之原則爲指南針。由於此一觀念，吾人負起與任何事物同樣深重之國家義務，並以吾人之資源及光榮加以効力，直至吾人可放心信賴之世界安全制度成立以後。吾人現不能逃避維持足以阻止侵略之軍力之負担，吾人去年在有效組織吾人武裝部隊方面大有進展，但在吾人國家安全法案方面尚需改良。普遍軍訓對美國之安全極爲重要。在本屆會議期際，余將有機會要求國會考慮在外交政策方面之若干措施。」</p>
<h3>美龐大新預算案　杜魯門下週一提交國會　支出數字將達四百卅億美元</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日鴛〕共和黨六日攻擊杜魯門之競選諾言及立法計劃稱：政府經濟竟被忽視，全國將因之破產。杜氏將於下週一向國會提出七月一日起一年內之支出預算。合衆社悉，若新澦算案仍依過去基礎計算，則支出數字將達四百三十億元。</p>
<p>杜魯門一年前估計本屆會計年度之支出數字爲三百七十七億元，去年之政府支出確數爲四百廿五億零五百萬元，故新數字顯然較前增加，社氏不得不要求增稅，民主共和兩黨議員恐不樂聞此。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕在杜魯門向國會聯席會議呼籲兩黨繼續對外交事務合作之後數分鐘，共和黨外交政策發言人范登堡在參院中宣佈民主黨採取「分道行動」，范氏稱，民主黨決議外委會席數中，民主黨佔八席共和黨佔五席，使渠詫異。當一九四六與一九四七年共和黨爲多數黨時，該會中共和黨佔七席，民主黨佔六席。范氏雖以強硬語調指責此一行動，但未直接對兩黨外交政策加以　實。</p>

<h3>寒夜怪劇閘北大火　燒燬棚戶五六百家　二千餘人流離失所　消防警三名奮勇施救受傷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕閘北中興路止圍路一帶棚戶中，昨晚發生大火，被焚五六百家，流離失所者二千餘人。火起時爲八時二十分，正值西北風緊，因之延燒甚速，未及半小時，巳成一片火海。迨消防處聞警調派紅口，新閘，中央，揚樹浦等區消防車及閘北商辦各段救火會出動馳往施救，終因該處水源缺乏，竟至無法控制。當時臨近火塲之居民，見狀相率扶老携幼，紛紛逃命。內中一部份被災住戶倉皇逃出時，大半衣履不全，值茲天寒地凍，轉輾街頭，顫慄呼冷，情況殊堪憐憫。大火蔓延東至公興路，北至中華新路，西至止園路，南至中興路附近，周圍地區均巳捲入火海。此中損失物資最多者，爲臨近中興路之明豐運輸公司堆棧，內中甫自江西蚌埠等地運抵之之　葉千餘包。至居民死傷情形，當夜尚無法調查，惟據火塲逃出之災民談稱，或有不少孩童業已葬身其間。火勢至十一時許始稍殺，記者曾胃險淮大火塲週園，但見焦士一片，熊熊火光猶在傢俱雜物中燃燒不息。號哨之聲，此起彼落，慘不忍聞。而損失最重之明豐運輸公司堆棧，其建築物為唯一之磚屋，惟因內貯烟葉被焚之故，白煙　　，至今晨未息。起火原因，聞係由一鞭砲作火藥爆炸所致，火首迄未緝獲。此次大火，消防處各重要負責人均親臨指揮，並有消防警四〇六號馬光榮，二八二號王聿法，及義勇消防警四一七號，因公受傷。北站警分局並曾派大批負警及義　警澈維秩序。</p>
<h3>樊崧甫將軍發表對和平呼籲意見　讓人民自己來決定命運</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報記者昨走訪息隱上海之革命宿將樊崧甫將軍，叩以對於和平呼籲之意見。樊氏戎馬半生，爲革命而努力，年來久不問政，但關切民生備至，彼對本報五日社論「讓主人來講話」，深表贊同，並發表其意見如次：</p>
<p>樊氏謂：在民三十四年冬政協會議時，超然的我，曾在軍慶中央日報發表一篇「和平前途之展望」。打打打，狠狠狠，和平女神早已逼得不敢伸一口氣，等待着死傷毀減的光臨。但是普遍的羣衆，都爲着自己的生命，任何一時間，總盼望和平來保障。到三十八年的元旦，終於和平一綫曙光衝動了！現在政府方面爲顧慮人民的生存，創議和平，極博得民衆的同情。但他方面容易懷疑爲政府的和平攻勢，利用議和期間重整兵力，或者以爲自己鬥爭勝利，乘乘此機會，可以澈底成功，因而不理會這個和平的呼聲。兩方如果不誠意，爾欺我處，那麼妥協一定難望有成，兩把快刀，仍舊擱在人民頭皮上。我們民衆爲求生存的延續，勢不能不起來做兩者的裁判。我們民衆外表是馴服的，但內心也明白的。我們知道「國」方有思想，有宣傳，但無實際表現；「共」方有宣傳，有行動，但缺乏高見和人才，軍事進展卽使快，政治推度跟不上，終究是一般糟！我們的忍耐是爲希望任何一方有眞正和平的辦法，如果眞正要逼我們到死亡綫上，我們迫不得已，那只有起來「自救救國」。從前中間路綫是以和平爲職志的，國民總是同情；現在到達週歸綫的時候，應卽自動出來斡旋了。斡旋的切莫要投機取巧，趁火打劫，要抱着慈悲的觀念，秉承眞正的民意，無論精神上事實上，終究是會成功的。那偏右一點兒和偏左一點兒的先生們，也勿以稍偏而自歉，及時軍新團結起來，成一個中間的大局而，加減乘除這左右兩大極端，再造一個新局面，收抬這殘破的亂局，人民爲生命的安全是永遠會感激他們的。至於和平的條件，國共兩方各有其立塲，公說公有理，婆說婆有理，未必會十分中肯的。他們雙方儘管提出來，應該讓我們人民自己來選擇，讓我們人民自已來決定自己的命運！</p>
<h3>荊磐石談和戰</h3>
<p>華盛頓世界基督徒領袖總會遠東理事會主席荊磐石博士，頃對記者談和戰問題，渠指出和平爲現時全國民衆一致之渴望，在共黨區人民亦然，此並非因在外表上看來政府軍事之不振或共黨之軍事順利而促成，實因中國人民不堪再受戰禍之蔓延，社會及國民生計已瀕於破產，民窮財雖已達於極點，如再長此繼續戰爭，不論政府或共黨均將爲後世歷史家留不齒污名，此時此刻應卽由無黨派關係中立人士出面調停和平，最爲適當。荊氏強調先使雙方停止軍事行動，卽日開誠相見，以國家人民利益爲前提，舉行和平談判，必爲全國人民所企望者。</p>

<p>頃據本市中外商各電力公司包括美商上海電力公司，滬西電力公司，法商電燈公司，商辦閘北水電公司，及華商浦東等電氣公司負責人發表書面談話略稱：「最近物價暴騰，外匯移轉證直綫上漲，及台幣換率不斷掛縮，影響發電廠消耗最巨之燃料卽燃油及煤價之不斷高漲。查八月一日煤價按法幣折合金圓，每公噸僅合二十陸元七角三分五，照現在外煤與台煤各半數扯價計算，竟高達一百〇五倍有奇，油價依據幣制改革前美元結匯證計算，增至五十二倍，生活指數在調整八月份電價時，係根據七月卅一日一百八十六萬倍計算，而現在金圓指數則以八月十五日三百六十三萬倍爲根據，此中相差，又幾及一倍。瞻望來日，繼漲增高，一月數遷，尚在意料之中。至十二月份之電價，僅於十二月上旬參酌當時情形，調整一次，事實上各公司對於此項調整後之電費，須至卅八年一月六日後，始可陸續收集，脫節過甚，以致入不敷出，虧損日劇，維持困難已瀕絕境。各公司代表，均已先後請求公用局依照工商部修改訂定及行政院備案之電價調整公式說明第十五條規定，「電廠售電成本，增減百分之二十時，依照公式計算電價，呈報主管機關核定，但電廠得先行收費，俟核定後多退少補」。具見政府業已有見及此，此項隨時調整辦法，實爲維持電業之唯一對策。各公司惟有遵照此項規定辦理，隨時調整，方可維持業務，繼續供應。如照現在電費核定辦法，須輾轉審核公布後，始得實行，迨至收到電費，非特幣值方面，折損已多，倘欲再事生產，實已無以爲繼，如此情形，已屬急不及待，勢將被迫停頓云。</p>

<h3>擁護總統倡導和平　各界昨開宣傳大會　和平須視對方有無誠意共黨執迷不司深感痛心</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各界昨晨十時假天蟾舞台舉行擁護總統倡導和平宣傳大會，本市各機關團體代表吳國楨·潘公展·方治。主曉籟。汪竹一。李馥蓀。水祥雲·周學湘·徐寄　等計千餘人均出席參加，大會公推濟公展担任總主席，開會後首由潘氏致詞稱：此次總統元且文吿發表後，吾人排讀之餘，不勝欣慰，回憶勝利三年來我國原可致力於建設，但因共黨始終堅持其武力奪取政權之主張，對「政協」亦毫無誠意表示，故政府不得已而用兵，過去三年內，由於共黨一念之差，致千萬人民流離失所，建設事業破壞殆盡。</p>
<p>效法佛氏精神　爭取自由和平</p>
<p>此次總統在文吿中已明白昭示，爲國族人民，在無害於國家獨立完整，人民生活自由得有保障等原則下，渠個人進退，將一唯人民之公意是從。吾人爲共黨設想，和平之門旣啓，彼等亦係黃帝十孫，應顧念人民生命生活，國家獨立完整，立卽停戰，開誠談判。惟近日來據北黨表示，猶準備堅持作戰到底，日前廣播，且誣總統文吿爲反動份子陰謀，如此執迷不悟，使全體人民之無窮期望又重歸幻減。今日此會，吾人一方面對總統文吿感到興奮，但同時又爲中共能度感到痛心，本市參議會等人民團體，已曾致電共黨，懇切呼籲，爲民請命，惜乎中共迄未有表示，故吾人目前祗有集中全民力量及意志，一方面加緊努力，促進和平，他方面更不可忽略作戰準備，中共倘對人民最後忠告置之不理，則卽爲吾人全體之公敵，吾人亦唯有與之週旋到底，在眞正和平尚未到來前，吾人仍應鼓勵前方將士，號召全國軍民，俾將來終克求得自由獨立之和平。潘氏末並以釋迦佛爲喻，謂昨日適逢臘八釋迦成道之日，勉全體應以釋迦普救衆生之精神，爭取和平。</p>
<p>須有充分力量　然後始測言和</p>
<p>繼由吳市長致詞謂：抗戰八年，戡亂三年，中國人民歷經苦難，無不希望和平，但和平非片面可致，對方亦須有放下武器之誠意，然後始能言和。吾人若有求和決心，應先表示仍有充分力量作戰，吳氏末勉本市市民應注意兩點：（一）加強本市自衛力量，（二）繼續慰勞前綫將士。次由方治演說，略謂：保障中國和平，旣是老百姓自己的事，老百姓就應當採取積極行動的表示。最近各省市參議會及各團體已通電主張和平，現在我們應當更進一步，推派工商社會各界孚衆望好和平的人民的代表，專機飛往共區，徵詢中共究竟有無和平誠意，如中共同意和，則大家言和，不和要打就打，這是共黨甘心與我老百姓僞敵，那也只有盡最後一拚。</p>
<p>應由人民督使達和平任務</p>
<p>方氏又謂。有人主張請英英法蘇書面調停，本人站在老百姓的立塲，是反對這種主張。中國的事，要應由中國人民自己管，還未到請外國朋友來干與的時機，外國朋友對中共情形，至今恐尚模糊，不見得能認識淸楚，所以和平的任務，應由老百姓自已來督促和達成。總之，我們希望共黨覺悟，開誠相見，言歸於好，那就是中國人民之福，如果執迷不返，堅持叛亂到底，那我們老百姓爲了保障自己的生命財產，爲了挽救中國的危亡，祗有大家團結，武裝起來，消滅共匪爭取和平。</p>
<p>嗣復由王曉籟·周學湘等相繼演說，大會直至近十二時，始於熱烈掌聲中宣吿結束。</p>
<p>大會告同胞書</p>
<p>昨日大會中通過吿全國同胞電文如下：全國各省市參議會，各團體，得報館，並轉全國同胞公鑒，溯自抗戰勝利，倭寇乞降，正海宇澄淸之日，民望治平之時，期羣策羣力，共謀和平我設，孰意政治協商，功敗垂成，抗戰之烽火初息，戡亂之兵戈又起，哀我　民，災禍不已，三載而還，戰火如茶，風雲關塞，血淚山河，勝利恍如夢幻，止戈知待何日？言念及此，悲憤填膺。我總統蔣公痌　爲懷，深不願長使生靈塗炭，特揭示元且文告，介導和平，情詞　懇，氣度寬宏，萬民咸感，中外同欽，所揭和平原則，亦卽爲立國之基本條件，吾全民所一致要求，對其個人進退出處，光明磊落之表示，尤足以使當世殘民以逞其私者，慚愧無地。中共同爲黃帝子孫，何爲役於外人，而自殘其見弟？驅民於砲火，殘忍孰甚！與其戰而同歸於盡，何若和而雙方共全，政府旣啓和平之門，中共應杜殺伐之路，縣崖勒馬，時猶未晚。本大會感於總統之至誠，不願使此一綫和平曙光稍縱卽逝，爲特通電全國同胞，警覺局勢，把握時機，力作和平共嗚，呼籲中共立卽現地停戰，並派全權代表，重開和談，推誠協商，屏絕嫌怨，尋求合情合理之解決，縱有爭執，亦應取決於民意，棄干戈於戰塲，執玉帛乎壇玷，則瀰天殺氣，立化積祥，願吾同胞，共為和平而奮起疾呼焉。上海市各界　護總統倡導和平大會，（魚）印。</p>

<h3>銀根緊俏益甚市拆冉冉上昂</h3>
<p>昨日市間銀根，走勢仍甚緊俏。業內行莊缺單普遍，外供極稀。各地匯款，少有到建，而行局繳收價款甚多，市塲頭寸，求過於供，市拆冉冉上昂。更因行莊欠息掛高，故見日拆五十元，高達六十元有求。週轉困窒之象，較除夕以前爲甚。同時現鈔籌碼亦吿帶緊，貼水仍有做開。</p>
<p>昨日中央銀行繳收拋售物資價款甚多，據業務局負責人稱，約達一億元相近。其中以棉紗結款最多，此外食糧人絲等款，爲數亦不在少。</p>
<h3>行莊普查告竣</h3>
<p>金管局日前所舉行之全市行莊普查，現已吿一段落。一般行莊業務，尚屬正常，存款數量已吿增加，惟發現有二三家行莊有製造假賬之嫌疑，刻該局正派員追查中。</p>
<p>又該局爲監督行局之存兌黃金事宜，巳於前日起分別派出大批幹員，至七兌換處所實地監督。其所監督之事項如下：（一）各行局發放申請書，是否合於正式手續，有無舞弊之情形。（二）繳款是否按照辦法解繳現款，（三）其他行局庫是否持現款卽日繳存中央銀行，連日檢查結果，據稱均極良好云。</p>

<h3>食糖漲多跌少</h3>
<p>食糖昨日行局抽緊銀根，市上暗息高升，業內脫貨放息，了售不絕，惟因前漲昨小，人心仍多看好，各檔先以低盤喊做，中間走勢盤旋，迄至收市，抬面又起買風，市況先低後高。</p>
<h3>茶市趨勢堅挺</h3>
<p>茶市昨爲新春紅盤第二日交易，雖在銀根趨緊，圈外物價下游中，惟人心尚堅，執戶喊價續履秀跡，致趨勢迭挺不已，行情比前更俏。綜觀此種情形，前途毫無岌岌可危之象，而查交易仍以吐納談判陷於相持，續僅寥寥做開。</p>
<h3>棉紗市況下游　布疋客銷不暢價見回小</h3>
<p>棉紗市勢虛軟，因銀根緊俏，致各紗漲後又回，惟細紗脚地仍堅，粗紗則見鬆落。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳以五二五〇〇元之高檔開出，中途曾低至四八〇〇〇元，午收復回至前日五〇〇〇〇元之原檔，與上日軋平。他若實光及天女等均鮮變動，四〇又藍鳳軋跌一五〇〇元，以四七五〇〇元結局，三二支藍鳳微挫三〇〇元。</p>

<h3>絲綢先低高</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市況高後轉低，業外各物先漲後回，外匯移轉證亦見回小，人心軟弱，更因銀根緊俏，市塲暗息升至五〇元，浮多逢高吐售，場上納胃間散，市氣疲軟。</p>
<p>一二〇號天梧晨開四八〇〇〇元，開後聞外匯又俏，市勢略挺，喊價步升千元，中間大戶逢高傾吐，散多跟蹤，進戶頓時觀望，市又回挫，臨收小至四八〇〇〇元了給，軋小二千元。東洋金三馬斯尼亞等，均一致帶軟。</p>
<p>生絲昨因人絲回軟，綢縀疲落，外銷貨洋行納胃未開，市況亦見軟弱，內銷貨本寗絲織業納胃不動，同業銀根緊俏，塲上買氣淸淡，各檔開盤卽回。D級七八度勻白廠絲初做五五〇〇〇元，中間交易寥寥，賣氣轉旺，喊價繼續下游，最低見五三〇〇〇元，近午缺單者巳按排舒齊，脫意稍懈，抬面乘低吸收，市況軟後轉挺，終以五四〇〇〇元收盤，與上日午收挫落五五〇〇元，其餘各檔一致步小。</p>
<p>綢縀昨因生絲人絲市勢軟弱，業外各物齊步回小，人心虛怯，市上出多進少，先以低盤開做，收市再見回升。美亞被面以二七一〇〇元低盤登市後，執戶起而拉抬，空方急補，納胃似見盛旺，喊價冉冉上升，徘徊於二九〇〇〇元左右，中間散戶紛了，市又疲落，走勢步高步低，最後業內銀根緊後稍鬆，各方人心又趨浮動，市勢先盤後升，近午以二九三〇〇元了結。華強二九二〇〇元，較前日午收，均見軋小二千餘元。大誠嗶縐無變動，大偉呢一〇〇元，小五元，四維呢微升三五元。</p>
<h3>桐油脚地回軟</h3>
<p>桐油昨市，轉呈原途盤旋之勢，良以自晨迄收，雖在賣戶繼續扳持中，惟因銀根突趨緊俏，加以各方買氣渺茫，卒感無力再漲，結果多與隔日相仿，脚地並不鞏固。</p>

<h3>蚌埠之冬</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記　凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠二日訊」在蚌埠的五十日中，記者目擊了徐州會戰和蚌宿會戰的開始或結束，今日肇鼓小休，細思其演變之經過，目多感觸。無可諱言，這次，在淮北的兩度大會戰當中，國軍有收穫，但也有挫折，今天當局已經決定了堅守淮河屏障京畿的策略了，局面固然嚴重，而失敗中含着教訓，今天在前方與後方，或是上級與與下層之間所蘊藏着的無數的問題，值得我們加以深思與檢討。</p>
<p>根據記者所看到，從宿縣淪陷起，到國軍退守淮河止，蚌埠本身永遠是那麼密靜和況着。中間雖然有點兒騷動，但這完全是人謀不臧所致。比如說吧：十一月底，國軍李黃兩兵團因受靈璧失陷的影響，原來準備在宿縣會師一的，這下子卻一直退到北淝河南岸，曹老集丟了，黑夜裹站在三層樓上可以看到三十華里以外的戰塲中的火光。蚱埠人本是滿不在乎的，可是經不住市政府，市參議會，商會，中央銀行的職員全體跑光，李人翹市長獨個兒留在市府，他是不能走的。商會六可一日負責無人，也重行選舉，後來局面穩定了，逃出去的人又個個地回來，蚌埠街頭上出現了這樣的標語·「蚌埠安如磐石，歡迎凱旋歸來的陳協五和郭華五」。（陳協五是前商會理事長，郭華五是中央銀行蚱行經理，）這是淮上人的幽默。再說吧：一星期以前，蚌埠盛傳着劉峙總司令巳經離蚌南返，大家都準備搬家，消息是市政府的副市長傳出來的，某綏區的一個處長也曾對記者提起，直到劉峙總司令率領豫皖蘇邊區淸剿副指揮官胡佛氏接連花了兩天的時間巡視市區各機關，謠言才平靜了下來。</p>
<p>淮上健兒最忠實</p>
<p>京滬尉勞團抵蚌之次日，蚌埠各界公宴慰勞團席上，國民黨蚌埠市黨部書記長邵恩曾提出蚌埠城防工事需款之巨，爲人民所不堪負担，而蚱埠之守衛，實際上并不祇爲蚌埠着想，這是有關整個局勢的一件事，所以其費用應由全國人民負祖，不該僅加到蚌埠人的頭上。立委趙惠談隨卽表示返京後常提出院會討論，其後，代表全國慰勞總會的邵華，也以淮北人的資格說了幾句。他說：淮上健兒過去有光輝的歷史，劉沛公，朱元璋所代表的漢明兩家功業，是絕好證明。不過今天淮上健兒已成爲一個「老牛破車」，可以用，但是用不好就要拖垮。他希望：今天起來領導淮上健兒的，要好好地來用它。淮上健兒是最忠實的，任何人都可以夾鞭策他，誰能夠好好地用他，他就是誰的忠實的工作者。邵先生這幾句談話，贏得滿堂掌聲。</p>
<p>抗戰八年不算，戡亂戰事打了三年，到今天戰事負担的誰屬還成爲問題來討論，這是我們的悲哀。蚌埠警備司令于兆龍將軍有過這樣一個表示：今天的戰事，是全民的戰事，出錢的不該僅限於戰地，也不該僅限於某一階層，他無力打破道一種偏見，他只有并曾蚌埠人儘量地節省。</p>
<p>突圍士兵携武器</p>
<p>記者在三年中跑遍遍了江河之間的戰塲，却以這一次在蚌埠受感動最深。黃維兵團突圍之後三日內，有剩了三十多個士兵的一個營，携了全副武器，輾轉到蚌報到，他們在街旁休息，等候收容。一個班長說：「老子過次不死，準還有幾年好活。」他的衣服濕了，脚跑爛了，然而絕沒有一句怨言。記者更親眼看到一位老百姓帶來鞋襪各一雙，送給一位脚實在不能跑的士兵，溫煖的同情心，使記者所看到的這一片天地，充滿了人問味。所以，憑記者的直覺，今天的士氣，大有可用，今天的民心，并未全死，祇看今後政府是否能夠好好地抓住，好好地利用而己。</p>

        <h1>1949.01.07</h1>
<h3>Li Zongren, Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, etc., Discuss Ways to Peace Talks; Bai Chongxi Invites Zhang Qun to Hankou for Observation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch] Since the President issued his message calling for peace, although the Communist Party has yet to issue a formal response, several key government officials who are working for peace, such as Vice President Li Zongren, Political Committee members Zhang Zhizhong and Zhang Qun, and National Policy Advisor Shao Lizi, have been in contact daily to discuss ways to move toward peace talks and achieve the goal of peace. It is not yet possible to ascertain what stage their research and efforts have reached, but it is believed that they must be studying a concrete plan, which is expected to be implemented only after the Communist Party issues a formal response. Several sources in the capital learned on the 6th of the New China News Agency's commentary on the President's message. Although the commentary directly criticized the message, its purely propagandistic tone made it difficult to regard as a formal response from the Chinese Communist Party. As of the 6th, all parties here were still awaiting a response. Government spokesman Shen Changhuan also stated on the 6th, in response to reporters' inquiries, that the government has not yet received a formal or informal response from the Communist Party regarding President Chiang's message. As for the issue of international mediation, it is also clearly a focus of attention, but American, Chinese, and Soviet figures in Nanjing are maintaining a silent attitude. A reporter asked Shen Changhuan whether any government officials had requested the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, or France, or any one of them, to come forward to mediate. Shen's response was: "To the best of my knowledge, no government official has made such contact." When asked whether any private individuals had made such contact, Shen stated that he did not have a comprehensive intelligence network sufficient to know of such private actions. According to Shen's response, the government has apparently not yet sent anyone to contact international friends. This may be a possible second step, but it will also have to wait for the Communist Party's response to determine whether or not to proceed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Bai Chongxi has recently been in close contact with some people in the central government in Nanjing on the issue of the current situation, using long-distance telephone calls. The person with whom he has been in constant contact is Vice President Li. Bai had a telephone conversation with Zhang Qun in Nanjing on the 5th, inviting him to go to Hankou. It is said that Bai's intention is to ask Zhang to observe the actual situation and dispel the doubts of the general public about him. As for whether Zhang will go immediately, it is said that he is still considering it.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The general public here believes that 1949 will be a year of peace for China, with only the most pessimistic believing that it will not be achieved until after June. However, no one dares to say that it will not require significant difficulties. Before President Chiang's New Year's message suggestion evolves into full peace, there will be many necessary procedures. Currently, public organizations are telegraphing to support the peace movement and advise the CCP leader Mao Zedong to order a ceasefire.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 6th] The New York Times stated in an editorial on the 6th: Although President Chiang's peace terms have been rejected by the Communist Party, these peace terms are only President Chiang's first offer, and the Communist Party's rejection has only been transmitted by the Communist Party's propaganda organs and does not come from the CCP leadership itself. Therefore, there is much room for negotiations and compromise between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The editorial concluded: The current peace depends on whether the Communist Party can listen to the people's demands for peace.</p>
<h3>Local Public Opinion Organs Continue to Call for Peace; National Representatives and Supervisory Committee Members from the Northeast Prepare to Form a Self-Salvation Association</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The national representatives and supervisory committee members from the Northeast in Beiping, together with the provincial and municipal councils, schools, and various organizations, have decided to establish the Northeast People's Self-Salvation Association on the 9th to carry out a peace movement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The Hebei Provincial Farmers' Association, Trade Union, Women's Association, Education Association, and Chamber of Commerce, five organizations, telegraphed Mao Zedong on the 6th, asking him to prioritize the country's lifeline and the people's lives, immediately cease military operations, accept peace talks, abandon force, cherish the country, respect public opinion, reduce the people's suffering, maintain national independence and integrity, and discuss openly to seek the realization of peaceful reunification and democracy.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 6th] Huaibei has suffered greatly from the war, and the citizens are extremely eager for peace. The council recently telegraphed President Chiang and Mao Zedong, asking them to respect public opinion, cease fire and negotiate, in order to maintain the country's vitality.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 6th] The Jiangxi Provincial Council telegraphed the President on the 6th, supporting his New Year's message, and telegraphed Mao Zedong, calling for peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou Dispatch, 6th] More than fifty national representatives from Hubei Province and Wuhan City held a temporary meeting on the 6th, passing telegrams to the President, Mao Zedong, and compatriots across the country, calling for an immediate ceasefire to seek peace together.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] The sixth session of the Hubei Provincial Council concluded at noon on the 6th. Elder statesman Li Shucheng and others delivered speeches, calling on the Chinese Communist Party to cease military operations. The Wuhan City Council responded to the President's New Year's message, telegraphing to the central government and both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to cease fire immediately, and hoping that the Communist Party would send representatives to conduct peace talks as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] Zhang Michuan and more than fifty national representatives from Hubei Province and Wuhan City telegraphed the central government and the Communist Party on the 6th, calling for peace to relieve the people's suffering.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 6th] The council responded to the President's message on the 6th, telegraphing to urge the Chinese Communist Party to cease fire.</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 6th] More than a hundred organizations, including the Three Principles of the People Knowledge and Action Society, telegraphed the President today in support of his peace message. They also telegraphed the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, asking them to prioritize the country and the nation and lay down their arms as soon as possible to hold peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 6th] The county temporary council resolved on the 6th to telegraph all county councils, supporting the President's New Year's message, advocating for peace, and responding to the Hubei Provincial Council's telegram, requesting a stop to conscription and the construction of city defense works.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 6th] The Zhenjiang County Council, Chamber of Commerce, and various industry associations jointly telegraphed the whole country on the 6th, calling for peace and asking the Communist Party to lay down its arms and solve the crisis. Legislative member Niu Jianchu also scheduled to convene a symposium on the current situation with legislative members in Zhenjiang at the provincial party headquarters on the 7th to discuss responding to the President's peace proposals.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member Liu Jianxu Talks About His Views on Striving for Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha Dispatch, 6th] Central Committee member Liu Jianxu published his views on striving for peace, stating briefly: The President's New Year's message has opened the door to peace. Not only are the people extremely pleased, but international friends should also pin boundless hopes on China's imminent end to its fate of suffering. Historically, there has never been a war that did not end in peace. From a humanitarian perspective, the tragedy of mutual slaughter should be stopped immediately. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have a history of cooperation twice. After the victory, they even jointly signed a program for peaceful national construction. Although the situation has changed today, the basic principles of the Three Principles of the People are still applicable to China. As long as both sides can openly and honestly discuss conditions based on these basic principles, there is no reason why peace cannot be achieved. What we hope for today is not only a fair and lasting peace, but also that everyone can deeply reflect on themselves, start anew, realize the Three Principles of the People, and create blessings for future generations to make up for today's trauma.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Central Standing Committee Discusses Reform Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held a routine meeting on the morning of the 6th, chaired by Cheng Siyuan, to discuss (1) the propaganda instructions for party departments at all levels after the President's New Year's message was issued, and approved that telegrams be sent to party departments at all levels today for compliance; (2) the party affairs reform plan was discussed for the first time, but because of time constraints, it was not completed and was handed over to a group for further research to be discussed at the next meeting. The plan is the result of the previous symposium, which was drafted by Huang Shao-gu et al. The most important aspect of the reform plan is the reform of the party's structure.</p>
<h3>No Changes in Personnel in Taiwan Yet; Chen Cheng Talks Individually with Various Department Heads</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 6th] Chairman Chen worked in the provincial government office all day today and talked individually with various department heads. The personnel issues that everyone is concerned about have not yet materialized. Chen only brought a few adjutants when he took office.</p>
<h3>Disguised as a Civilian, Breaks Through the Heavy Siege; Sun Yuanliang Escapes Danger and Arrives in Hankou; Endures Hardships, Takes Twenty-Nine Days to Reach Xinyang; Accompanied by Zhang Zhen to Hankou to Visit Commander-in-Chief Bai</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] Sun Yuanliang, Commander of the 16th Army Corps, safely arrived in Xinyang on the 3rd. On the evening of the 5th, he was accompanied by Zhang Zhen, Chairman of Henan Province, from Xinyang to Hankou. He immediately went to the Suppression Headquarters to visit Commander-in-Chief Bai, reported the circumstances of his escape, and attended the Suppression Headquarters dinner, leaving at 11 o'clock in the evening, so few outsiders knew about it. This reporter visited Mr. Sun at his residence this morning. Mr. Sun was wearing a newly made military uniform, and although he looked slightly tired, he was in high spirits. According to him, after the army corps was surrounded by Chen Yi's Guangdong-Guangxi Column and other units at the beginning of last month, supply became seriously difficult. Although the soldiers' will to fight was strong, they had no way to feed themselves and had to kill livestock to fill their stomachs. Almost all of the army's warhorses had been eaten, and some soldiers had even starved to death. Fighting in this state of starvation for three or four days, the Communist army suffered heavy losses. Eventually, their ammunition ran out and there was no support, and the morale of the army could not be controlled, and they inevitably dispersed sporadically. Seeing that there was nothing he could do, he had no choice but to disguise himself as a civilian and break through the heavy encirclement from the Yongcheng position in northern Anhui on the 7th of last month. In addition to personally leading more than a thousand officers and soldiers who have safely arrived in southern Henan, most of the remaining subordinates have also been concentrated in favorable areas and are currently preparing to continue their efforts. I took the road through the Yellow River flood area in Henan and traveled through Xuchang to Xinyang, taking a total of twenty-nine days. It was not until 9:00 am on the 3rd that I saw my comrades again in Xinyang. I am currently telegraphing to Nanjing to report and will fly to Nanjing for instructions as soon as I receive a reply. After speaking, the guard told him that the car was ready. Mr. Sun said to the reporter, "I have to go to the Suppression Headquarters now. We'll talk again later."</p>
<p>According to Chairman Zhang Zhen, General Sun had endured great hardships during this escape. When he first arrived in Xinyang, he was wearing plain clothes and had a full beard. He first spoke to Chief of Staff Xi of the Fifth Pacification District and immediately sent a car to welcome him into the city to meet with me (Zhang referring to himself) and I gave him 5,000 yuan for the cost of a new uniform. After arriving in Hankou, Commander-in-Chief Bai praised Sun for his bravery and steadfastness and expressed his deep condolences on behalf of the central government.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The news that General Sun Yuanliang had escaped danger and arrived in Xinyang and then went to Hankou was confirmed by Deng Wenyi, spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, on the 6th. Deng said: Mr. Sun led his troops to break through the encirclement, and his troops have reached a safe area.</p>
<h3>Lu Dangping, Jiang Dangyi, etc., Arrive in Hankou to Visit Commander-in-Chief Bai</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] Lu Dangping, a member of the Central Committee, and Zhu Wenyin, a local dignitary from Hunan Province, arrived in Hankou from Hunan last night. The two went to the Suppression Headquarters together this morning to visit Commander-in-Chief Bai and had lunch with Bai at his residence. General Sun Yuanliang and Chairman Zhang Zhen, who had recently arrived in Hankou, were also present. In addition, Jiang Dangyi, the military leader of a certain army, also arrived in Hankou from Hunan on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Deng Wenyi Officially Confirms That Liu Bocheng Was Indeed Killed in the Bombing; Five Other Bandit Army Generals Also Died</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The rumor that Liu Bocheng, commander of the Communist bandit "Central Plains Liberation Army," was killed in an airstrike while commanding the battle in northern Anhui was officially confirmed by Deng Wenyi, spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, on the 6th. Deng announced while hosting reporters: Liu Bocheng was killed on the morning of the 13th of last month in a concentrated bombing by a group of B24 aircraft in Taoyuanpu, northern Anhui. At the time, Liu was commanding the bandit army to attack Huang Wei's army corps in Shuangduiji. He and five other senior generals were traveling in one small car and two jeep army vehicles to the front line to command. They were hit by bombs, and the five generals were killed on the spot. Their names have not yet been determined. Liu had one leg blown off and was injured in the abdomen. He died on the way back. Bandits in Suixi, Suxian, Zhengzhou, and other places held a memorial meeting on the 18th, and the value of the banknotes issued by the pseudo-Zhongzhou Town Office in Zhengzhou plummeted as a result. Liu's death has been confirmed by military intelligence, prisoner confessions, and local residents' accounts. The bandit army purchased a coffin with 30 dan of wheat for Liu's body and buried it in Dongpingji, northeast of Taoyuanji. Deng also said: "After bandit Liu's death, his troops were commanded by his subordinate Chen Geng. Because of Liu Bocheng's death, the bandits entrenched in central China have temporarily taken a defensive position because there is no one to lead them. Liu Bocheng was an outstanding military leader in the bandit army. He had been in the military for more than 30 years and had received military training in the Soviet Union and Germany. His combat style was known for its cunning." (Note: Chen Geng and Deng Wenyi were classmates at the Whampoa Military Academy 25 years ago).</p>
<h3>The Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Decides to Establish a Political Affairs Committee; Zhu Shaozhou Appointed Secretary-General</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters recently decided to establish a Political Affairs Committee, with Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo concurrently serving as chairman, and Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, Nanjing Mayor Teng Jie, and others as ex officio members. Zhu Shaozhou has been appointed as the Secretary-General of the Committee.</p>
<h3>US Officials Remain Silent on Marine Corps Plans in China; President of Shandong University and Others Host Farewell Banquet for Brigadier General Rupertus</h3>
<p>[United Press, City Dispatch] Officials are remaining silent about the plans of the US Marine Corps in China, but evidence of their preparation to withdraw is gradually increasing. It is generally believed that a formal statement will be issued by the US State Department. United Press reporters from Qingdao claim that the Marine Corps are hastily packing their equipment, but Commander of the Western Pacific Fleet Rupertus refused to elaborate on his statement on the 4th that the US military will not withdraw from China. Shandong University will hand over the school on the 25th. The 3,000 US troops stationed at the school will return to their ships, and a portion will likely return to Guam.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 6th] Zhao Taimou, President of Shandong University, Li Daifang, Speaker of the Provincial Council, and Cui Shijie, a member of the Legislative Yuan, hosted a banquet at the International Club this afternoon for Rupertus, Commander of the Western Pacific Fleet, and Thomas, Commander of the Marine Corps, to express their gratitude for the assistance provided by the US Navy and Marine Corps to Qingdao City in the past. Liu Anqi, Gong Xuesui, and other leaders were also invited to attend. The US Western Pacific Military Broadcasting Station has temporarily suspended broadcasting.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Analyzes the Current Situation and Advocates Taking Two Steps to Open the Door to Peace Talks; Encourages Middle Forces to Engage in Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the China Democratic Socialist Party, analyzed the current situation yesterday, saying that it is not easy to resume peace talks. There are currently two steps that should be taken first to open the door to peace talks. One is to lift the ban on speech. Since the suppression of the rebellion, any pro-peace remarks have violated the law, making it impossible for those who are willing to do their best to start. Now that the government has sincerely sought peace, this ban should be lifted immediately so that people from all walks of life who are willing to work for peace can mobilize their forces, form a middle force, and mediate between the two parties. Only then is there hope for peace. The second is to restore certain "routes" of contact with the CCP to clarify the other party's true intentions. For example, Zhang Dongsun recently expressed his willingness to go south to mediate, and the government should encourage him. Regarding the issue of the CCP's sincerity for peace, Zhang believes that there may be differences of opinion within the CCP regarding peace and war, so there is no formal response to the President's message. However, the CCP is a political party that has close relations with world politics, and its actions have their own proportions. Moreover, in judging the situation, although it currently has a temporary advantage militarily, it does not have the strength to sweep the country, so it may also be appropriate to stop. As for the leaders of the CCP, Zhang firmly believes that Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and others are inclined towards peace and can take care of the interests of the country. As for the talk of mediation by the four countries, Zhang said that he had heard people promoting it in the United States last autumn, but he did not get the gist of it. As for whether the proposal for mediation by the United Nations can be implemented, it depends on whether China's internal affairs constitute an international dispute. Of course, the India-Pakistan war was mediated by the United Nations, but India and Pakistan are indeed two countries, which is very different from the current situation in China, so the hope of resolving the situation through the United Nations is minimal.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Xia Taosheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the China Youth Party, visited Zhang Junmai yesterday afternoon to exchange views on the peace issue.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Beiping Civilian Aviation Resumes Yesterday; A China National Aviation Corporation Plane Arrives in Beiping and Takes Away Thirty-Six People; Treasures from the Palace Museum and the Library Are Transported Out of Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Civilian aviation officially resumed today. A China National Aviation Corporation transport plane flew from Shanghai to Beiping at 2:00 pm today, taking away thirty-six passengers, mostly family members of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation employees. The Beiping Headquarters stated that flights will continue to operate starting tomorrow, with six planes arriving in Beiping each week.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The Palace Museum and the Beiping Library are both using civilian aviation to transport out some of their treasures, including porcelain and Han books. The Great Dictionary Compilation Office has decided to move to Taipei, while Li Jinxi will remain in Beiping for the time being. The Ministry of Education will no longer send special planes for professors to leave. Professors going south will take civilian planes and leave Beiping one after another.</p>
<h3>Bandits in the Suburbs of Beiping Are Constructing Fortifications; Fighting Intensifies Around Tianjin; National Army Withdraws from the Huidui Stronghold in the Southern Suburbs</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Military news: Communist bandits are constructing fortifications in the suburbs of Beiping, seemingly attempting to besiege Beiping. The authorities are actively trying to solve the food problem and are airlifting flour to Beiping, which is expected to begin soon. Prices are rising and the value of gold and silver is fluctuating sharply.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 5th] It is learned that the Communist army now possesses many medium-sized Japanese artillery pieces. Japan handed over these artillery pieces to the Soviet Union after the surrender, and the Communist army obtained them from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 6th] Military news: From 11:00 pm on the 4th to the morning of the 5th, the 9th Column, 27th Division, and part of the Independent 4th Division of the Lin Biao bandits launched several fierce attacks on the Huidui stronghold in the southern suburbs of Tianjin, once infiltrating near Fuxingmen. The fighting was fierce. The bandits are still confronting the National Army in Huidui.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 6th] After a fierce artillery battle broke out in the four suburbs of Tianjin on the night of the 5th, the daytime on the 6th was relatively quiet. There was no major contact on the northeast front, but the situation around the periphery became increasingly tense. A continuous artillery battle occurred in Liqizhuang, south of Tianjin, at 1:00 pm on the 6th. Communication between Huidui and Tianjin has been cut off. A fierce battle broke out outside Xiyingmen, west of Tianjin, after 5:00 pm.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch, 6th] Tianjin Garrison Headquarters News: The bandits, in order to invade Tianjin, are inhuman and unscrupulous. In addition to using human wave tactics to attack our Huidui, they are wantonly setting fire to civilians' homes. After our officers and soldiers put out the fires, they are gradually being extinguished. The number of civilians burned to death is being investigated. The bandit army's artillery is constantly bombarding the No. 4 Cotton Mill, the No. 1 Steel Plant, and nearby civilians' homes, causing huge losses to local residents.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch, 6th] The Tianjin Garrison Headquarters announced: The battle on the Huidui front in the south of Tianjin ended at 12:00 noon on the 6th. After our army resisted heroically and inflicted heavy blows on the enemy, the defending troops were ordered to end the battle at 12:00 noon on the 6th and actively moved to the city defense line. The military authorities have provided appropriate arrangements for the heroic officers and soldiers who defended the area and fought hard for two days and nights.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch, 6th] Since the fierce battle broke out in the suburbs of Tianjin on the 4th, the artillery fire has become more intense on the night of the 5th. According to the announcement of the Political Work Department of the Garrison Headquarters: On the night of the 4th, the bandits of the 1st Division of the 1st Column were repelled on our Dayuan Village stronghold on the west side of Tianjin. On the night of the 5th, they gathered the remnants of the bandits again and approached the stronghold, triggering more than a dozen landmines, killing and wounding more than 160 bandits. After suffering this blow, the bandits used artillery to bombard our positions, disregarding humanity and firing tear gas, launching a fierce attack on us. Eight soldiers guarding our front-line bunkers were poisoned and killed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced on the 6th: The National Army in Tanggu continues to maintain mobility and strengthen fortifications. Beitang and Xinhe are both under the control of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 5th] Our powerful naval fleet has achieved major victories in the Tanggu-Dagu area in the past three weeks. Whenever the bandits attacked from outer strongholds such as Xinhe, Xichang Village, and Xiaojiadao, the ships would bombard them with fierce artillery fire, killing many bandits. On the 26th of last month, the bandits held a cadre meeting in Daliangzi and were discovered and bombarded by one of our gunboats. According to reliable information, in addition to killing many of their cadres, the commander of one bandit division and the commander of one bandit regiment were also killed. The gunboat was commended by the naval authorities for its meritorious service.</p>

<h3>A Brief Summary of the Week's War Situation Released by the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of National Defense recently released a summary of the war situation for the week of December 30, 1948, to January 5, 1949, as follows: Due to the severe cold weather this week, there were no major battles on any of the national battlefields. However, the national army's air force and artillery have exerted their power, inflicting great casualties on the bandits. A brief summary of the war situation in various regions is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In the Pingjin Area: The bandit army has been adjusting its deployment this week, and there have been no major battles. Two-thirds of Lin Biao's main force, approximately eight columns, have concentrated around Tianjin. The focus of recent battles may shift to the outskirts of Tianjin. In the Beiping area: Rongzhen's bandit forces are being successively transferred from the PingSui and PingHan lines to the vicinity of Beiping. Only the Fifth and Eleventh Columns of Lin Biao's forces remain in the ancient suburbs, and there have been no major battles recently. The national army in Tanggu has been launching attacks daily, achieving many gains. According to front-line reports, Zhan Caifang, the commander of the Ninth Column of the bandits, convened a cadre meeting in the Daliangzi area west of Xidagu on the morning of the 30th. It was struck by our naval artillery fire, causing many casualties among the bandit's senior cadres. Those who have been confirmed dead include Zeng Liyu, the commander of the 25th Division of the Ninth Column of the bandits; Chief of Staff Shuai Zijun; Political Commissar Jiang Honghai; Jin Li, the commander of the 26th Division; Chief of Staff Wu Wenhua; and Political Commissar Li Zhenchun. The search for bodies is continuing.</p>
<p>(2) In the Taiyuan Area: The bandits entrenched outside Taiyuan are demoralized due to their repeated failures in battle. Taking advantage of the bandits' fatigue, the national army launched a local offensive against the bandits during the New Year, killing more than 800 bandits in the areas of Yinjia Fort, Houjiang, Ganjiapeng, Heituo, and south of Baijiazhuang, and destroying dozens of bandit fortifications. The national army in Taiyuan is becoming stronger in battle, and the surrounding bandit army no longer dares to risk attacking. The national army in Datong has also launched search and suppression operations in all directions this week, killing more than 700 bandits. There are currently no traces of bandits within 40 li of the outer perimeter of Datong.</p>
<p>(3) In the Jianghuai Area: After the Battle of SuBeng concluded, the national army immediately made strong deployments along the Huai River. Chen and Liu's bandit forces suffered heavy losses and are currently unable to advance south. Liu's columns are resting and reorganizing in the area north and south of Sixian, while the majority of Chen's forces are in the northwest of Xikou, in a stalemate with our Du Yuming Corps. The national army has ample supplies of food and ammunition, and morale is high, while the bandit army is hungry and cold, in a very difficult situation. Currently, Chen's columns are only relying on deep fortifications to block our army from advancing south. There have been no major battles this week, except for sporadic engagements. The New Second Column of Chen's bandits, who roamed around the Hongze Lake, Xuyi, and Tianchang areas, has been severely suppressed by the national army in recent days, suffering more than 1,000 casualties. The remnants of the bandits have fled in a northeast direction, and the national army has entered Tianchang a few days ago.</p>
<p>In addition, the various battlefields in Northwest China were very quiet this week. After Liu's Tenth Column and Kong Congzhou's bandit forces, who had entrenched themselves in Fancheng, were defeated by our army, they fled to Xiangyin Town and other places. The bandits' plan to harass the Xiangfan area has been crushed by our army.</p>
<p>Since the President issued a proclamation on New Year's Day, calling for peace with the bandits, the war-weariness of the lower-level cadres and soldiers of the bandit army has become more pronounced than before. If the bandit leaders do not realize their mistakes and repent, and stop the rebellion, the day will eventually come when their subordinates will automatically cease fighting. The people of the country can wait and see.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A New Dawn for Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Of the current border policies, the Xinjiang issue is the most noteworthy, and the evolution and development of the Xinjiang situation are most relevant to the overall domestic situation. In recent years, the Xinjiang issue has become increasingly complex, with ethnic, religious, political, and international factors intertwined, leading to multiple disturbances and disputes. Especially since the Baitashan incident, the Xinjiang situation has suddenly become serious. Thanks to the patience and adaptability of Northwest Administrative Director General Zhang Zhizhong and the calm handling of Xinjiang Province Chairman Mesut, the tense atmosphere in Xinjiang has been transformed into peace, thus stabilizing the Northwest situation. Recently, in order to reconcile internal opinions in Xinjiang and promote the unity of Xinjiang nationalities, the central government appointed Burhan as the Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, Muhammad Amin as the Vice Chairman, and Liu Mengchun as the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government. The former Chairman Mesut and Secretary-General Isa were dismissed and await further assignments, and the former Committee Member and Vice Chairman Abdul Kerim Khan Mahsut was dismissed from his concurrent position. Burhan and Amin are currently in Dihua and have expressed their acceptance of the new appointments. Liu Mengchun has also arrived in Dihua to arrange everything and has held talks with the Soviet Consul General stationed in Dihua. This indicates a major change in Xinjiang's administration, which will bring a new dawn for our country's peaceful and unified future.</p>
<p>The Xinjiang situation is complex and confusing, especially since the special status of the Ili, Tacheng, and Altai regions and the continuous creation of ethnic divisions by a few separatists have led to increasing instability in Xinjiang. Mesut's appointment as Chairman of Xinjiang not only failed to ease the internal contradictions among the Xinjiang nationalities, but on the contrary, provided various excuses for the Ili separatists. Last year's disturbances in the Altai region and the Baitashan incident were planned and instigated by the separatists to resist the government. In this chaotic situation, Zhang Zhizhong and Mesut's attitude of adapting to the situation was to be open and fair, to seek understanding among nationalities and religions through tolerance, and to seek political and international harmony through enlightenment. One only needs to look at the Xinjiang Provincial Government's inaction against the Ili three regions and Zhang Zhizhong's many letters to the separatists explaining the great righteousness to know that the government's enlightened and tolerant policy has gradually succeeded and has had a significant effect.</p>
<p>The first manifestation of this in fact is that Burhan, a member of the National Government from Xinjiang, and Amin, the director of the Xinjiang Provincial Construction Department, went south to report on their work, expressing the sincerity of the Uyghur people to turn inward. Burhan is a wise man of the Uyghur people, who studied in Europe in his early years and has extensive writings. He enjoys high prestige among the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and even the Ili separatists respect him. Burhan and Amin brought the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe from Xinjiang, which was acclaimed in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. The overflowing unity and songs still make people in the mainland nostalgic. They also brought a "Xinjiang Construction Five-Year Plan" from Xinjiang, requesting financial and human assistance from the central government and various parties, which has won the support and sympathy of people from all walks of life. The second manifestation of this in fact is the election and establishment of the Xinjiang county councils and the election of local administrative officials in various counties, cities, and administrative commissioner districts. The Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic groups have all enthusiastically participated. Mesut upheld the principle of fairness and carefully guided the election affairs throughout the province, which has won the goodwill of people throughout the province. This event symbolizes that the majority of ethnic groups and religious people in Xinjiang support the national policy and the central government, and further demonstrates that under the central government's patient and firm determination leadership, the complex and chaotic Xinjiang is moving towards democracy in politics and unity in ethnicity, and is finally able to obtain stable factors. This is a major achievement of Xinjiang's politics in the past year, laying the foundation for peace and happiness for Xinjiang and the Northwest.</p>
<p>This time, the central government appointed Burhan and Amin to preside over Xinjiang, and appointed Liu Mengchun, Zhang Zhizhong's think tank, to assist in the provincial administration of the new province. This shows that the central government has made further efforts and attaches greater importance to the future of peace and unity in Xinjiang. First, Burhan and Amin are determined and have plans for the economic construction of Xinjiang. The major problem in Xinjiang today is still the economic problem. The resources are unexploited, the people's wealth and income cannot be increased, and the ideal living standard cannot be established. If the construction of people's livelihood can be successful in Xinjiang, then the stability of Xinjiang will be beneficial to the future of the nation and the country. Second, Burhan has prestige in the new province. He is upright and open in his work and studies, and has no partisan background, which is deeply supported by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. This time, Burhan has received a good response from the general public for accepting this new appointment. Burhan also stated in his leisure life in Dihua that "the future of Xinjiang is very optimistic," which shows that the confrontational stalemate in the Ili three regions is expected to be broken soon, and Burhan is confident in the peace and unity of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Based on these two points, we should celebrate the bright future of Xinjiang in advance, and celebrate the future of national unity in advance.</p>
<p>In short, the Xinjiang issue has gradually become clear. Political development is moving towards democracy, and economic development is moving towards construction, which will help stabilize the Xinjiang situation. The stability of Xinjiang will naturally eliminate internal contradictions and external temptations. All this depends on the efforts of Burhan and others. On the one hand, we celebrate the bright future of Xinjiang, and at the same time, we must call for the vigilance of a few separatists in Ili, Tacheng, and Altai. The door to peace and unity in Xinjiang has been opened, and they should quickly return to reason and return to the road of peace and unity!</p>
<h3>The Crisis of a New World War is Increasing China will be the Main Battlefield Western Countries Can Win After a Long Struggle Reported by Fang En of the Associated Press</h3>
<p>[Fang En, Director of the Far East Branch of the Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] The conquest of most of Northeast and North China by the Chinese Communist army has changed the entire strategic situation in the Western Pacific and East Asia. Non-communist military and political figures in these two regions share this sentiment.</p>
<p>In the past twelve months, the author has visited almost all of Asia and met with local leaders and European and American leaders. They generally believe that the danger of a new world war being triggered in Asia is increasing. The same omens as when Japan conquered the Northeast and Japanese warlords stepped into the Chinese mainland in 1931-33 have begun to appear. The position of the Chinese Communist army and Moscow on the issue of war and peace in the Western Pacific is exactly the same as the position of Tokyo in the Pearl Harbor incident.</p>
<p>The obvious possibility of war between the Western allies led by Britain and the United States and the communist countries led by the Soviet Union can already be seen. However, the most well-informed observers do not believe that this great war will break out immediately. They emphasize that the Soviet Union is not currently preparing for a major war and may not be ready for several years. It is generally believed that China will immediately become the main battlefield. The Soviet Union has already won the first round in China. The Northeast has actually become a satellite state of the Soviet Union, and Outer Mongolia and North China are rushing into the Soviet sphere. Some qualified British and American observers believe that Asia is the main goal of the Soviet Union in the current "cold war." The Soviet Union's aggressive tactics in Berlin and other parts of Western Europe are to cover up other real major offensives in the Far East. It is generally recalled that the Soviet Union clearly stated as early as 1924 that it intended to pull China into the Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>At that time, the Soviet Union sent a large military and political advisory group to assist Sun Yat-sen's national revolution. They also pointed out that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party were the people who began to accept communist ideas at that time. The current confrontation is shaped as follows. The Allies control the Japanese archipelago south to Taiwan, Okinawa, and the Philippines. In Southeast Asia, they control India and its neighboring islands, including the Dutch East Indies and Ceylon. The status of democratic countries in Burma and Indonesia is not strong. Britain has not yet completely suppressed the communist rebellion in Malaya. The Soviet Union and its communist allies now control Siberia in Northwest Asia and islands that can see Alaska, as well as the Kuril Islands south to Sakhalin Island, which is only separated from the northern tip of Japan by a strip of water. North Korea, the Northeast, Outer Mongolia, and most of North China are under Soviet control. In addition, it also has strong positions in the former Japanese bases in southern Sakhalin and Xinjiang. In the areas controlled by the Western Allies, there are stronger land, sea, and air bases. The Western Allies may have superior naval supremacy, excluding submarines, and also have an advantage in air supremacy. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union's land forces are extremely dominant and may occupy several areas currently occupied by the Western Allies and hold them for some time. In addition, the Soviet Union has no atomic bombs and its industrial productivity is far behind the West. The general opinion is that if war occurs in the future, Western countries can win, but only after a long struggle that consumes their strength and resources.</p>

<h3>Second Half of the 37th Year: National Treasury Revenue and Expenditure Closure Handled; Executive Yuan Instructs Subordinates to Comply</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The second half of the 37th year has already ended. Due to currency reform, the various supplementary budgets for the second half of the year could not be approved, and tax revenues from various revenue agencies were not remitted to the national treasury by the end of December. The Executive Yuan's advances also failed to complete the legislative process as scheduled. As a result, all revenue and expenditure, as well as receivables and payables, could not be finalized. The Executive Yuan, based on the joint request from the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministry of Finance, in order to handle the situation with flexibility and to prevent the discrepancy between national treasury revenue and expenditure and the preliminary and final accounts from becoming too large, approved the "Measures for Closing National Treasury Revenue and Expenditure for the Second Half of the 37th Year" drafted by the two ministries.

<p>(2) For national treasury revenue in the second half of the 37th year, funds deposited and transferred to various agencies by the 20th, general operating expense deposits may continue to be used until the end of February.

<h3>Essentials of Conscription During the Period of Suppression of Rebellion; Ministry of National Defense Formulated to Be Implemented from New Year's Day</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of National Defense believes that the implementation of military service laws during the emergency of suppressing the rebellion has not achieved the desired effect. To ensure that laws align with reality, simplify administration, and facilitate the people, the Ministry has formulated the "Essentials of Conscription During the Period of Suppression of Rebellion." These will be uniformly implemented nationwide from January 1st of the 38th year. The full text of the essentials is as follows:</p>
<p>A. General Principles Article 1: These essentials are formulated to meet the needs of suppressing the rebellion, strengthen basic-level military service work, implement "teach before war," and achieve "lean military and simple administration."</p>
<p>Article 2: The purpose of these essentials is to flexibly apply existing military service laws, reduce practical difficulties, facilitate the people, and ensure the combat effectiveness of the national army.</p>
<p>B. Conscription Article 3: County (city) conscription is subject to the command, supervision, and assessment of the garrison district. The county (city) magistrate, concurrently serving as the commander of the self-defense corps, shall be fully responsible and will be subject to stricter performance reviews. The implementation principles are as follows: (1) The county (city) government's military affairs section (unit) shall handle the military service administration and conscription processing and planning. (2) Each county (city) shall have the self-defense corps handle the organization, training, and management of conscriptible draftees, and the county (city) magistrate shall select one additional deputy commander from among the officers in the villages to assist in the process. (3) The county (city) self-defense corps shall organize all able-bodied men aged twenty to twenty-five (the age range may be extended if necessary) into conscriptible units, based on township (district), conduct background investigations in accordance with the conscription processing rules, create detailed rosters, accurately track them, and prepare them for conscription at any time. (4) The county (city) government shall establish a conscription center during the conscription period, with the commander and deputy commander of the self-defense corps concurrently serving as the director and deputy director of the center. Based on the garrison district's conscription orders, the required number of conscriptible draftees shall be gathered from the conscriptible units within a deadline of ten days. (5) The conscriptible draftees gathered at the county (city) conscription center shall be organized by township (district). The management may be handled by locally stationed officers and soldiers from the regular self-defense force and security team, with appropriate allowances. Leaders shall be elected from among the draftees by township (district) to assist in management and family communication. (6) The county (city) military service association shall be responsible for military service supervision, publicity, preferential treatment for conscript families, and shall operate in accordance with the regulations for the organization of military service associations. Township (town) branches of the military service association may also be established as needed, and their organization and tasks shall be determined by the county (city) military service association.</p>
<p>Article 4: The allocation of conscription quotas shall be based on the county (city) as the allocation unit, and the bao as the basic-level allocation unit. The principles are as follows: (1) The central allocation to each province (city) and the allocation to each county (city) shall be based on population ratio, but may be appropriately increased or decreased based on security, border defense, and industrial conditions. (2) The allocation of each county (city) to each township (town) (district) and the allocation of each township (town) (district) to each bao shall be based on population or able-bodied men ratio. (3) If the local security situation in each province is likely to change, each province may, with the aim of not delaying the conscription quota, appropriately allocate a reserve quota after reporting for approval for adjustment purposes. (4) The able-bodied men required for local security and guard duties shall be allocated according to the principles in the preceding two paragraphs, without affecting the regular conscription quota.</p>
<p>Article 5: The implementation of conscription shall be based on the county (city) as the conscription unit and the township (town) (district) as the basic-level conscription unit. The principles are as follows: (1) The background investigation of conscriptible draftees in the township (town) (district) shall be completed before the beginning of each year. At the same time, households shall be classified into two-son households, three-son households, or four-son and five-son households, etc. (by analogy), and their organization shall be completed, ready for conscription at any time. The term "number of sons in the household" refers to the number of fathers, sons, siblings, and relatives living together, aged eighteen to forty-five. (2) Based on the prescribed conscription quota, the township (town) (district) shall collect conscriptible draftees from the conscriptible units of each township (town) (district) and conscript by bao according to the quota for each bao. (3) After the conscriptible draftees from each bao are gathered in the township (town) (district), the township (town) (district) chief, together with the bao chief, shall be responsible for accurately conducting a background re-investigation and preliminary physical assessment of the draftees. Once the number of qualified individuals is sufficient, they shall be sent to the county (city) conscription center. (4) When the conscriptible draftees from each township (town) (district) arrive at the county (city) conscription center, a physical examination shall be conducted immediately. After passing the examination, they shall be handed over to the new recruit team of the division or garrison district in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>Article 6: The principles for selecting conscriptible draftees during the implementation of conscription are as follows: (1) The selection of conscriptible draftees shall be carried out in accordance with the conscription processing rules and lottery methods. (2) In areas where household registration control has not been effectively implemented, the following methods may be adopted depending on the circumstances: 1. In rural baos, the township (town) (district) government shall be responsible for conducting lotteries, selecting draftees primarily from households with multiple sons, according to the quota for each bao. If there are draftees who volunteer to be conscripted first, they may be selected first. 2. In urban baos and general households, the district government shall be responsible for conducting lotteries in the same way as in rural baos. For companies, firms, factories, institutions, schools, and military agencies and units, excluding those with active-duty personnel and those who are exempt or deferred, the organization shall be used as the lottery target, and draftees shall be selected according to the proportion of conscriptible draftees. 3. If conscriptible draftees in the above-mentioned organizations also have the status of general households, the organization where they are located shall be used as the standard.</p>
<p>Article 7: The scope of deferment and postponement of conscription shall be narrowed, and the methods shall be determined separately.</p>
<p>Article 8: The principles for conscription processing procedures and application submission procedures during conscription are as follows: (1) Background investigations and lotteries shall be the responsibility of the township (town) (district) and shall be carried out separately before conscription. Physical examinations and conscription shall be carried out by the county (city) before handing over to the new recruit team of the garrison district. (2) When conscriptible units implement conscription, if the draftee is the one who drew the lot or volunteered, their parents (head of household) and family members eligible for preferential treatment shall fill out a "Application for Enlistment Guarantee" (as per the attached form). If the draftee is from an organization, the person in charge of the organization and their family members eligible for preferential treatment shall fill it out. If there are no family members, the bao chief shall be the guarantor. (3) The above-mentioned application for enlistment guarantee shall be submitted along with the conscriptible draftee. After the handover of the draftees, the county (city) government shall retain it.</p>
<p>Article 9: If volunteer soldiers can be recruited locally, and they can raise some usable weapons, and the cadres are competent to fight in the suppression of the rebellion, they may be recruited after reporting to the Ministry of National Defense for approval, without affecting the regular conscription conditions.</p>
<p>Article 10: The navy, air force, special forces, specialized soldiers, and units with good local relationships in certain areas may recruit after reporting to the Ministry of National Defense. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Truman to Submit Special Message; Elucidating US Foreign Policy; Situation in Our Country to Be Reviewed with Concern; Expanding Military Aid Abroad Program; Establishing Anti-Communist Bulwark</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Diplomatic authorities here announced today that President Truman will likely deliver an important statement on foreign policy within two weeks, reviewing the situation in China and its impact on the US defense strategy in the Eastern Pacific. In addition, he will report on the situation in Indonesia and Palestine, which the government has been quite concerned about for months. The statement will be issued at the latest by the inauguration ceremony on the 20th of next month, but it may also be delivered earlier, in the form of a special message to Congress. In yesterday's internal policy message, he only briefly mentioned foreign affairs. The upcoming statement will elaborate on the entire policy scope formulated by the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the Economic Cooperation Administration. There are two entirely new plans in the drafting stage: joining the North Atlantic Military Alliance to establish an anti-communist bulwark until the Western European countries are able to resist the Soviet Union on their own, and expanding the military aid abroad program to authorize the President to supply arms to the Western European countries, thereby accelerating their military build-up and providing them with a full sense of security. In addition, the President is expected to request an extension of the European Recovery Program for three years, provide further assistance to Greece and Turkey, and continue to adopt a firm stance against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] In his first message to Congress on the 5th, President Truman only made a brief and theoretical statement on the key points of the "Truman Doctrine" in terms of foreign policy. The President promised to elaborate on his foreign policy in another message in the future, stating today only: "We are pursuing a foreign policy that is an outward expression of our people's democratic beliefs. We are striving to encourage free nations and free people around the world to help those who are suffering and in distress abroad, and to strengthen democratic countries to resist aggression. The core of our foreign policy is peace. We support the United Nations in maintaining peace, and we adopt world economic policies to promote human prosperity. We are guided by the principle of international cooperation. Because of this concept, we bear a national obligation that is as profound as anything, and we will use our resources and honor to give it effect until a world security system that we can confidently rely on is established. We cannot now avoid the burden of maintaining military forces sufficient to deter aggression. We made great progress last year in effectively organizing our armed forces, but there is still a need for improvement in our national security legislation. Universal military training is extremely important to the security of the United States. During this session, I will have the opportunity to ask Congress to consider a number of measures in the area of foreign policy."</p>
<h3>America's Massive New Budget Proposal; Truman to Submit to Congress Next Monday; Expenditure Figures Will Reach 43 Billion US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] Republicans attacked Truman's campaign promises and legislative plans on the 6th, claiming that the government's economy was being neglected and the nation would go bankrupt as a result. Mr. Du will submit to Congress next Monday a budget for expenditures for the year beginning July 1. Associated Press has learned that if the new budget proposal is still calculated on the basis of the past, the expenditure figure will reach 43 billion US dollars.</p>
<p>Truman estimated a year ago that the expenditure figure for the current fiscal year would be 37.7 billion US dollars. The actual government expenditure for last year was 42.5 billion and 5 million US dollars, so the new figure is clearly higher than before. The agency had to ask for increased taxes, which both Democratic and Republican members feared to hear.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] President Truman consulted extensively with Treasury Secretary Snyder and government financial experts and Democratic leaders in Congress this morning, making final revisions to the budget message he will read to Congress. The message will outline the 1949-50 budget proposal.</p>
<h3>US Senate Committees; Under Democratic Control; Vandenberg Complains</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 5th] The selection of Democratic senators to be placed on the fifteen standing committees of the Senate was announced today, showing that the Democrats in this session of Congress occupy the majority of key positions, even more so than the Republicans in the previous session of Congress. One of the changes is that the majority party's control over the Foreign Relations Committee has increased. The Democratic committee has increased to eight members, while the Republicans occupy five seats. In the previous Congress, the seats on the Foreign Relations Committee were in a ratio of seven to six. Vice-President Barkley, who is about to take office, said in response to criticisms of this decision that he did not find any reason why this change would affect the foreign policy of the two parties. In terms of committee seat allocation, the Democrats announced another change today, namely that the proportion of committee members from both parties in the Appropriations Committee will be thirteen to eight, rather than the twelve to nine ratio maintained by the Republicans in the previous Congress. Senator McKellar, a Democrat from Tennessee, will serve as chairman of the committee. The Senate Democrats also appointed members to the other thirteen standing committees of the Senate. On the House side, members of some committees have also been announced by the majority party, but the complete determination of all committee members in both houses will still take some time.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] Minutes after Truman called on a joint session of Congress for continued bipartisan cooperation on foreign affairs, Republican foreign policy spokesman Vandenberg announced in the Senate that the Democrats had taken "separate action." Mr. Fan said that the Democratic resolution that Democrats occupy eight seats and Republicans occupy five seats on the Foreign Relations Committee surprised him. When the Republicans were the majority party in 1946 and 1947, the Republicans occupied seven seats and the Democrats occupied six seats on the committee. Although Mr. Fan criticized this action in strong terms, he did not directly target the foreign policy of the two parties.</p>
<h3>Rumor That Warren May Be Appointed; Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, San Francisco, 5th] The San Francisco Daily reported today that California Governor Warren, who previously supported Dewey in the presidential election, will resign in the near future to take up a new position appointed by Truman. It also stated that Warren will fill the vacancy left by Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Vincent, after Marshall is replaced as Secretary of State?</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Sacramento, 5th] Warren denied today the rumors that Du Ru wanted to appoint him as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and said that he suspected that the president may not have this appointment.</p>
<h3>Israel Violates Egyptian Territory; Britain Expresses Deep Concern; Egypt Unwilling to Receive British Arms Supplies Under Alliance</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Cairo, 5th] A well-informed source stated on the 5th that as the British government increasingly expressed concern about Israel's continued attacks in the Negev region, the Egyptian army had repelled the Jewish army's attack in fierce battles. Sources in London revealed that British troops are being sent to the Holy Land and the Egyptian border, hoping to prevent Israeli patrols from invading Egyptian territory again. The British government condemned Israel's deliberate violation of Egyptian territory.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 5th] A senior British government official said tonight: If the Israeli army does not obey the order to cease fire and continues its operations on the Egyptian border, Britain will ask the Security Council to lift the arms embargo on Arab countries.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Cairo, 6th] "Al-Ahram" reported on the 6th that Britain is willing to supply Egypt with military equipment according to the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian alliance, but Egypt has refused, because the Egyptian government believes that the agreement has long expired. Therefore, Egypt will not formally request arms supplies from Britain under the terms of the treaty.</p>
<h3>Truman Praised for Promoting "Fair Politics"</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] The Truman administration is known as "fair politics." After all, in his federal message to Congress on the 5th, Mr. Du guaranteed the implementation of "fair politics." He said: "Every part and every individual of our country has the right to expect the government to implement fair politics."</p>
<h3>Reactions to Truman's Message; Praise and Criticism Vary by Party; Labor Organizations Express Strong Support</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 5th] Reactions in Congress to President Truman's federal message today varied depending on the party affiliation of the members. In general, most Democratic members agreed with the President's legislative proposals, while most Republican members criticized them. Leaders of the two largest labor groups in the United States, the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, both agreed with Truman's recommendations, especially in supporting the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act. A labor spokesman said that he would provide "positive" recommendations on the repeal of the act.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Wall Street attacked Truman, saying that he had plunged the United States into socialism. Extreme leftists attacked Du, saying that he attempted to prevent socialism with limited national control policies. This policy will certainly not be realized in the coming years.</p>

<h3>Strange Tragedy in Cold Night: Huge Fire in Zhabei; Five to Six Hundred Shanties Destroyed; More Than Two Thousand People Displaced; Three Firefighters and Police Injured in Brave Rescue Efforts</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] A major fire broke out last night in the shantytowns along Zhongxing Road and Zhiwei Road in Zhabei, destroying five to six hundred houses and displacing more than two thousand people. The fire started at 8:20 PM, just as the northwest wind was blowing strongly, so it spread very quickly and turned into a sea of ​​flames in less than half an hour. When the Fire Department received the alarm, it dispatched fire engines from Hongkou, Xinzha, Central, and Yangshupu districts, as well as fire brigades from various sections of Zhabei's businesses and offices, to rush to the rescue, but due to the lack of water sources in the area, it was impossible to control the fire. Residents near the scene, seeing this, supported the elderly and carried the young, and fled for their lives. Most of the displaced residents who fled in a hurry were not fully clothed, and in the freezing weather, they wandered the streets, shivering and calling out with cold, their situation was particularly pitiful. The fire spread east to Gongxing Road, north to Zhonghua Xin Road, west to Zhiyuan Road, and south to the vicinity of Zhongxing Road, and the surrounding areas were engulfed in the fire. The most material losses were suffered by the Mingfeng Transportation Company warehouse near Zhongxing Road, which contained more than a thousand packages of tobacco leaves recently transported from Jiangxi, Bengbu and other places. As for the deaths and injuries of residents, it was impossible to investigate that night, but according to the victims who escaped from the scene, many children may have been buried there. The fire began to subside slightly around 11 PM. This reporter ventured around the scene of the fire and saw only scorched earth. The raging flames were still burning in the furniture and debris. The sound of wailing could be heard everywhere, which was unbearable to hear. The Mingfeng Transportation Company warehouse, which suffered the most damage, was the only brick building, but due to the tobacco leaves stored inside being burned, white smoke continued to rise, even until this morning. The cause of the fire was said to be an explosion of gunpowder from firecrackers. The arsonist has not yet been caught. During this fire, all important heads of the Fire Department were present to direct the firefighting, and Fire Police No. 406 Ma Guangrong, No. 282 Wang Yufa, and Volunteer Fire Police No. 417 were injured in the line of duty. The North Railway Station Police Precinct also dispatched a large number of police officers and auxiliary police to maintain order.</p>
<h3>General Fan Songfu Expresses Views on Peace Appeal: Let the People Decide Their Own Destiny</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] This newspaper's reporter visited General Fan Songfu, a veteran revolutionary who has been living in Shanghai in retirement, to ask for his opinion on the call for peace. Fan has spent half his life in the military, working for the revolution. In recent years, he has not been involved in politics, but he is extremely concerned about the people's livelihood. He deeply agreed with this newspaper's editorial on the 5th, "Let the People Speak," and expressed his views as follows:</p>
<p>Fan said: During the Political Consultative Conference in the winter of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), I, as an objective observer, published an article in the Military Celebration Central Daily News entitled "Prospects for Peace." Fighting and ruthlessness have long forced the goddess of peace to not dare to breathe, waiting for the coming of death, injury, and destruction. However, the general public, for their own lives, always hope for peace to guarantee them at any time. On New Year's Day of the 38th year (1949), a glimmer of hope for peace finally emerged! Now, the government is initiating peace for the sake of the people's survival, which has won the sympathy of the public. However, the other side is easily suspected of using the peace offensive to reorganize its forces during the ceasefire, or believes that its own struggle has been victorious and takes this opportunity to succeed completely, and therefore ignores this call for peace. If both sides are not sincere and deceive each other, then compromise will be difficult to achieve, and two sharp knives will still be hanging over the heads of the people. In order to continue their survival, our people must rise up and act as judges for both sides. Our people are docile on the outside, but clear on the inside. We know that the "Nationalist" side has ideas and propaganda, but no practical expression; the "Communist" side has propaganda and action, but lacks insight and talent. Even if military progress is fast, political progress cannot keep up, and in the end, everything is bad! Our patience is for the hope that either side has a real way to achieve peace. If they really want to force us to the line of death, we have no choice but to rise up and "save ourselves and save the country." In the past, the middle road line was committed to peace, and the people always sympathized. Now that it has reached the time for the weekly return line, it should immediately come out to mediate. The mediation must not be opportunistic and take advantage of the fire to rob, but must hold a compassionate view and abide by the true will of the people. Whether in spirit or in fact, it will eventually be successful. Those gentlemen who are a little to the right and a little to the left should not feel ashamed because they are slightly biased, and should unite in time to form a middle ground and add, subtract, multiply, and divide these two extremes to create a new situation and clean up this broken mess. The people will always be grateful to them for the safety of their lives. As for the conditions for peace, the Nationalist and Communist parties each have their own positions. Everyone has their own reasons, and they may not be very accurate. They can both bring them up, but we should let our people choose for themselves and let our people decide their own destiny!</p>
<h3>Jing Panshi Talks About War and Peace</h3>
<p>Dr. Jing Panshi, Chairman of the Far East Council of the World Christian Leaders Association in Washington, recently spoke to reporters about the issue of war and peace. He pointed out that peace is the unanimous desire of the people throughout the country at this time, and this is also true in the Communist areas. This is not caused by the apparent military weakness of the government army or the military success of the Communist Party. In fact, it is because the Chinese people cannot bear the spread of war any longer, and the social and national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. The poverty of the people and the exhaustion of wealth have reached their extreme. If the war continues for a long time, both the government and the Communist Party will leave a disgraceful name for future historians. At this moment, it is most appropriate for neutral people with no party affiliation to come forward to mediate peace. Jing emphasized that the most desirable thing for the people of the country is to first stop military action on both sides, immediately meet each other frankly, and hold peace talks with the interests of the country and the people as the premise.</p>

The defendants Mei Zhezhi, Chen Boen, and Yu Songqing all appeared in court. Chen Boen appeared in court while ill, and was given a seat in court to await trial. Mei confessed to the Financial Management Bureau's fabrication of a "Zhang Gonglian" account by the bank: the bank's organization still adopted a general management system, and in addition to adjusting the personnel of each branch and auditing the forms, it did not directly manage external business. The fabrication of the "Zhang Gonglian" dark account was done by the Shanghai branch, and the head office did not know about it in advance. Chen Boen, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai branch of the bank, testified: "The 'Zhang Gonglian' dark account was set up by the previous Deputy Manager Chen Deshan for the welfare of the bank's colleagues. He also handled business on August 4th of last year, and is not responsible for the fabrication of the dark account. Regarding the 20 shares of foreign currency stock and 100,000 shares of Yongsha in the inventory, they were deposited by a friend, and the staff was negligent and failed to register them. Quan Songqing of the Shanghai office of the bank testified: He is an overseas Chinese who has recently returned to China and is not proficient in Chinese. He often asks for leave due to illness and is not clear about the bank's affairs. After Mei made a statement, the debate ended, and it was decided to pronounce the verdict at 9 AM on the 13th of this month. All defendants were released on their original bail.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Officially Announces Rice Ration Price This Month: 63 Yuan per Dou; Priority Rice Ration Price: 42 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The municipal government officially announced yesterday the price of rice rations for this month, which is 15 catties per month, totaling 63 yuan in gold yuan. Each certificate can purchase one dou of rice, including 12 catties of whole rice and 3 catties of broken rice. In addition, the priority rice allocation for the five types of employees, including public educators, journalists, and industrial workers, will continue to be piloted, and the price will be 42 yuan in gold yuan. A responsible person from the Civil Mediation Office solemnly stated that the rice ration price reported yesterday (6th) was slightly different because the final method was changed, and it was decided that only 3 catties of broken rice would be included. The price announced by the municipal government shall prevail, and citizens are requested to pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Whole Rice and Broken Rice Must Not be Sold Mixed</h3>
<p>[Another Dispatch] From now on, when distributing rice, each rice store must weigh and deliver whole rice and broken rice to the buyer in person, and must not sell them mixed.

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Power Companies Request Timely Adjustment of Electricity Prices: Continuous Rise in Fuel Prices Will Make It Impossible to Maintain Operations</h3>
<p>According to a written statement recently issued by the responsible persons of various Chinese and foreign power companies in this city, including American-owned Shanghai Electric Power Company, Huxi Electric Power Company, French-owned Electricity Company, Shangban Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and Chinese-owned Pudong Electric Company, etc., "Recent soaring prices, the direct increase in foreign exchange transfer certificates, and the continuous shrinking of the Taiwan dollar exchange rate have had the greatest impact on the constant high increase of fuel, namely fuel oil and coal prices, which are the most consumed by power plants. On August 1st, the price of coal was converted into gold yuan according to the legal currency, only equivalent to 26 yuan, 7 jiao, 3 fen and 5 li per ton. According to the current calculation of the price of foreign coal and Taiwan coal each accounting for half, it has increased by more than 105 times. According to the exchange certificate of US dollars before the currency reform, the price of oil has increased by 52 times. The cost of living index at the time of adjusting the electricity price in August was calculated based on 1.86 million times on July 31st, while the current gold yuan index is based on 3.63 million times on August 15th, and the difference between them is almost one time. Looking to the future, continued increases are expected in the coming days, with changes occurring several times a month. The electricity price in December was only adjusted once in early December with reference to the situation at that time. In fact, each company will not be able to collect the electricity bills after this adjustment until after January 6th of the 38th year, and the disconnection is too great, resulting in insufficient income and expenditure, and the losses are increasing day by day, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain operations, which is on the verge of collapse. The representatives of each company have successively requested the Public Utilities Bureau to follow the 15th provision of the explanation of the electricity price adjustment formula modified and stipulated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and filed with the Executive Yuan, "When the electricity sales cost of the power plant increases or decreases by 20 percent, the electricity price shall be calculated according to the formula and reported to the competent authority for approval, but the power plant may collect fees in advance, and refund or compensate for any excess or deficiency after approval." It is clear that the government has already foreseen this, and this timely adjustment method is the only countermeasure to maintain the power industry. Each company can only maintain its business and continue to supply by following this regulation and adjusting in a timely manner. If the current electricity price approval method is followed, it must be reviewed, approved, and announced before it can be implemented. By the time the electricity bills are received, not only will there be losses in terms of currency value, but if they want to resume production, there will be nothing to follow. This situation is too urgent, and they will be forced to stop operations.</p>

<h3>High Coal Oil Ration Price for Public Educators; Various Agencies Will Request Verification and Reduction</h3>
<p>Public educators from various agencies in this city believe that the distribution price of coal oil for public educators for November and December of last year, distributed by the China Petroleum Corporation, is as high as 279 yuan, which is inappropriate. Therefore, they will jointly submit a request to the Public Educator Supplies Committee, requesting a reasonable verification and reduction.</p>
<h3>Relief Society's Mobile Shelters Will Also Operate During the Day</h3>

<h3>Supporting the President and Advocating for Peace: All Circles Held a Propaganda Meeting Yesterday; Peace Depends on the Sincerity of the Other Party, Deeply Saddened by the Communist Party's Stubbornness</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, all circles in the city held a propaganda meeting at the Tianchan Theater to support the President and advocate for peace. Representatives from various organs and groups in the city, including Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Zhu Xiaolai, Wang Zhuyi, Li Fusun, Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, and Xu Jiyu, totaling over a thousand people, attended the meeting. The meeting publicly elected Pan Gongzhan as the general chairman. After the meeting began, Pan first delivered a speech, saying: After the President's New Year's Day message was published this time, we were overjoyed after reading it. Recalling the past three years since the victory, our country could have devoted itself to construction, but because the Communist Party has always insisted on its claim to seize power by force and showed no sincerity towards the "Political Consultative Conference," the government had no choice but to use force. In the past three years, due to the Communist Party's momentary misjudgment, millions of people have been displaced and construction projects have been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Emulating the Spirit of Buddha, Striving for Freedom and Peace</p>
<p>This time, the President has clearly demonstrated in his message that, for the sake of the nation and its people, and under the principles of not harming national independence and integrity, and ensuring the people's freedom and livelihood, his personal advancement or retreat will solely follow the public opinion of the people. On behalf of the Communist Party, we believe that since the door to peace has been opened, they are also descendants of the Yellow Emperor and should consider the people's lives and livelihoods, as well as the country's independence and integrity. They should immediately cease fire and engage in open and honest negotiations. However, according to recent statements from the Northern Communist Party, they are still preparing to insist on fighting to the end. Furthermore, their recent broadcast falsely accused the President's message of being a conspiracy by reactionaries. Such stubbornness has caused the infinite expectations of the entire people to return to disillusionment. At today's meeting, we are excited about the President's message on the one hand, but at the same time, we are saddened by the Communist Party's actions. People's organizations such as the Municipal Council have already sent telegrams to the Communist Party, earnestly appealing and pleading for the people. Unfortunately, the Communist Party has not yet responded. Therefore, at present, we can only concentrate the strength and will of the entire people. On the one hand, we must intensify our efforts to promote peace; on the other hand, we must not neglect preparations for war. If the Communist Party ignores the people's final advice, then it will be the public enemy of our entire people, and we will have no choice but to deal with it to the end. Before true peace arrives, we should still encourage the soldiers at the front and call on the national army and civilians so that we can eventually achieve free and independent peace. At the end of his speech, Pan used Sakyamuni Buddha as an analogy, saying that yesterday happened to be the day Sakyamuni Buddha attained enlightenment on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, encouraging everyone to strive for peace with the spirit of Sakyamuni's universal salvation of all beings.</p>
<p>Must Have Sufficient Strength Before Considering Peace Talks</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, saying: After eight years of the War of Resistance and three years of suppressing the rebellion, the Chinese people have experienced suffering, and everyone hopes for peace. However, peace cannot be achieved unilaterally; the other party must also have the sincerity to lay down their weapons before we can talk about peace. If we have the determination to seek peace, we should first show that we still have sufficient strength to fight. At the end of his speech, Wu encouraged the citizens of the city to pay attention to two points: (1) strengthen the city's self-defense capabilities, and (2) continue to comfort the soldiers on the front lines. Next, Fang Zhi gave a speech, roughly saying: Since safeguarding China's peace is the business of the common people themselves, the common people should take active action to express their views. Recently, the councils and organizations of various provinces and cities have sent telegrams advocating for peace. Now, we should go a step further and send representatives of the people who are well-respected and peace-loving from the industrial, commercial, and social circles to the Communist areas by special plane to inquire whether the Communist Party has any sincerity for peace. If the Communist Party agrees to peace, then everyone will talk about peace. If they don't want peace and want to fight, then let's fight. If the Communist Party is willing to be an enemy of our common people, then we can only make a final stand.</p>
<p>The People Should Supervise the Achievement of the Peace Mission</p>
<p>Fang also said: Some people advocate for inviting the British, French, and Soviet governments to mediate in writing. Standing in the position of the common people, I am against this proposal. China's affairs should be managed by the Chinese people themselves. The time has not yet come to ask foreign friends to intervene. Foreign friends may still be unclear about the situation of the Communist Party and may not be able to understand it clearly. Therefore, the mission of peace should be supervised and achieved by the people themselves. In short, we hope that the Communist Party will wake up, be open and honest with each other, and return to good relations. That would be a blessing for the Chinese people. If they are stubborn and insist on rebellion to the end, then our common people, in order to protect their own lives and property, and in order to save China from danger, will have no choice but to unite, arm ourselves, eliminate the Communist bandits, and strive for peace.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Wang Xiaolai, Zhou Xuexiang, and others delivered speeches one after another. The meeting did not end until nearly twelve o'clock, with enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>Appeal to Compatriots from the General Assembly</p>
<p>The telegram to compatriots across the country passed at yesterday's meeting is as follows: To all provincial and municipal councils, organizations, newspaper offices, and to all compatriots across the country. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, when the Japanese bandits surrendered, it was a time when the world was clear and the people hoped for peace and stability. We looked forward to pooling our collective wisdom and efforts to jointly plan for peace and stability. Who would have thought that the political consultation would fail, and the flames of the War of Resistance had just subsided, but the war to suppress the rebellion had begun again? Alas, my people, disasters have not ceased. After three years, the flames of war are raging like tea, the situation at the border is turbulent, and the mountains and rivers are stained with blood and tears. The victory feels like a dream, and who knows when the war will end? Thinking of this, grief and indignation fill our hearts. Our President Chiang Kai-shek deeply cares for the people and does not want to prolong the suffering of the people. He specially issued a New Year's Day message to promote peace. The words are sincere, and the demeanor is generous, which is appreciated by all the people and admired by people at home and abroad. The principles of peace he proposed are also the basic conditions for establishing the country, which our entire people unanimously demand. His open and honest expression regarding his personal advancement or retreat is especially enough to make those who take advantage of the current situation to indulge their selfish desires feel ashamed. The Communist Party is also a descendant of the Yellow Emperor. Why are they enslaved by foreigners and harm their brothers? Driving the people into the flames of war is extremely cruel! Rather than fighting to mutual destruction, why not reconcile and allow both sides to survive? The government has already opened the door to peace, and the Communist Party should stop the path of killing. It is not too late to rein in at the precipice. This meeting feels the President's sincerity and does not want this glimmer of peace to be fleeting. Therefore, we are specially sending a telegram to compatriots across the country to be alert to the situation, seize the opportunity, and strive to resonate with peace. We call on the Communist Party to immediately cease fire on the ground, and send plenipotentiary representatives to reopen peace talks, negotiate sincerely, eliminate suspicion and resentment, and seek a reasonable solution. Even if there are disputes, they should be decided by public opinion, abandoning weapons on the battlefield, and holding jade and silk at the altar. Then the overwhelming atmosphere of killing will be transformed into auspiciousness. We hope that our compatriots will rise up and cry out for peace together. Shanghai All Circles Support the President and Advocate for Peace General Assembly, (seal).</p>

<h3>Abundant Arrivals, Tight Credit; Rice Prices Dropped Yesterday; Flour, Grain, Oil Cakes: Weakening Confidence, Consistent Decline</h3>
<p>The rice market has turned downstream. As the end of the year approaches, rural goods are arriving in abundance. Yesterday, arrivals increased sharply. In addition, credit is tight and other commodity prices have weakened. Sellers are eager to sell and there are many samples, causing prices to fall. The price of white粳 in the North Market fell to 760 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan compared to before. Single-season稻 also fell by 50 yuan each. 羊秈 and 社秈 fell by 60 yuan. Only the indigenous rice, due to its scarcity and active sales, remained at its original price. In the South Rice Market, white粳 and early rice each fell by 20 yuan, and light rice fell by 10 yuan. The premium white rice remained firm. Arrivals in the two markets totaled 16,699 shi.</p>
<p>Flour has fallen from its peak. Due to tight credit and the decline in non-industry commodity prices, sellers are dumping a lot. However, due to the absorption by the North gang, the price of "military ship flour" is higher than that of "old car flour." Old car flour is 335 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan from the previous day. The closing price of military ship flour is 343 yuan, a decrease of 38 yuan from the previous day. Red Bee and Jiancheng each fell by 46-47 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour also fell. Bran also followed suit, with large bags of bran falling by 35 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains: Under tight credit, prices have fallen across the board. Due to the financial difficulties of the foreign gangs, purchases are slow and stagnant. The closing price of yellow soybeans dropped sharply, with the closing price of乍豆 at 450 yuan, a decrease of 90 yuan. The absorption of corn by the North gang was small, and the price dropped by more than 10%. Huangdu corn was very active and was the only one that remained stable. Red sorghum fell by 50 yuan. Mung beans and元麦 all fell sharply. Sesame fell sharply by 100 yuan. 生仁 was not bought by the Cantonese gang and dropped by 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking oil has fallen by 10%. Due to tight credit and the decline in non-industry commodity prices, confidence has weakened. Moreover, oil factories have opened a lot. Soybean oil factories opened at 2,700 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,500 yuan. The closing price rebounded to 2,650 yuan, but it was still 300 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. The closing price of raw 棻 oil was 2,450 yuan, a decrease of 350 yuan. The opening price of 吉桶 raw oil was 2,700 yuan, a decrease of 300 yuan. The closing price of small car sesame oil was 2,100 yuan, a decrease of 420 yuan. Soybean cakes fell sharply by 30-40 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Bureau's Hai Chuan vessel arrived in Shanghai from Wuhu yesterday, carrying more than 7,500 bags of Wuhu秈 and more than 1,000 tons of miscellaneous grains. It is currently docked at the Jin Zhaoyuan Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Credit Tightness Intensifies; Interbank Lending Rates Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>Yesterday, credit in the city was still very tight. Interbank borrowing was widespread, and external supply was extremely scarce. Remittances from various places rarely arrived, and banks collected a lot of payments. Market funds were in short supply, and interbank lending rates rose steadily. Furthermore, because banks were carrying high overdue interest, the daily lending rate was as high as 50-60 yuan. The liquidity crunch was even worse than before New Year's Eve. At the same time, the supply of cash was also tight, and discounts were still being offered.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank collected a lot of proceeds from the sale of confiscated goods. According to the person in charge of the business bureau, the amount was close to 100 million yuan. Among them, cotton yarn settlements were the largest, followed by food grains and silk.</p>
<h3>General Inspection of Banks and Shops Completed</h3>
<p>The general inspection of banks and shops in the city, which was conducted by the Gold Control Bureau a few days ago, has now come to an end. The general operations of banks and shops are still normal, and the amount of deposits has increased. However, it was found that two or three banks and shops were suspected of creating false accounts, and the bureau is currently sending personnel to investigate.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to supervise the deposit and exchange of gold by banks and shops, the bureau has dispatched a large number of staff members to the seven exchange locations to conduct on-site supervision. The matters being supervised are as follows: (1) Whether the application forms issued by each bank and shop comply with formal procedures and whether there is any fraud. (2) Whether the payments are remitted in cash in accordance with the regulations. (3) Whether the other banks and shops deposit the cash in the Central Bank on the same day. According to reports, the results of the inspections over the past few days have been very good.</p>
<h3>More Than Twenty Banks Have Used Increased Capital in Cash</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Although the competent authorities are aware of the tight credit situation, they have allowed banks and shops to use the cash portion of their increased capital. Yesterday, about twenty banks and shops applied to the Gold Control Bureau to use it, and all were approved by the bureau. According to regulations, the use of the cash portion of increased capital has long been approved by the Ministry of Finance, but it must be used for production and construction purposes. According to the Central Bank, the period of use is usually ten days, up to one month, and must be approved by the Gold Control Bureau after reviewing its purpose.</p>
<h3>Fifth Meeting of the Production Loan to Continue Reviewing Industrial Loan Cases</h3>
<p>The Special Loans Committee is expediting the handling of purchase cases in the emergency industrial loan program. To date, the committee has approved more than 200 purchase cases, with a total amount of more than 30 million yuan. Cases that are not suitable for purchase or those who are unwilling to purchase have applied for transfer to mortgage and rediscount, and there are currently many cases. The committee is scheduled to convene its fifth secret review meeting on production and export businesses at 3:00 PM today to discuss this matter.</p>
<p>According to Lin Chongyong, Secretary-General of the Special Loans Committee, the Central Bank's emergency industrial loan program focuses especially on small factories. These small factories are in a particularly difficult situation, and the committee is currently drafting measures based on the actual situation so that all small factories in the city can benefit from the government's benefits.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Mostly Increased, Few Decreased</h3>
<p>Yesterday, banks tightened credit, interbank interest rates rose secretly, and internal sales of goods for interest continued in the market. However, because of the small increase in prices before, people were still optimistic about the market. Each shop first quoted low prices, and the market trend fluctuated in the middle. Until the close, buying sentiment rose again, and the market situation was low first and high later.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Trend Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of trading for the tea market in the new spring. Although credit was tight and prices of external commodities were falling, people's confidence remained firm and brokers continued to quote higher prices, causing the trend to continue to rise. The market was more bullish than before. Overall, this situation shows no signs of imminent danger, and transactions are still limited and protracted due to haggling.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Downstream; Cloth Sales Slow, Prices See Small Decline</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is weak. Due to tight credit, the price of each yarn has fallen again after rising. However, the price of fine yarn remains firm, while the price of coarse yarn has loosened.</p>
<p>42-count Lanfeng opened at a high price of 52,500 yuan, but fell to 48,000 yuan in the middle. The noon closing price recovered to the original price of 50,000 yuan of the previous day, leveling with the previous day. There was little change in other yarns such as Shiguang and Tiannu. 40-count Lanfeng fell by 1,500 yuan, ending at 47,500 yuan. 32-count Lanfeng fell slightly by 300 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Shuangma spot goods rose from 33,000 yuan to a maximum of 36,500 yuan, and finally closed at 34,200 yuan, falling by 1,300 yuan. Factory orders fell by 1,500 yuan, and arbitrage for one day was 2,000 yuan. 20-count Shuangma fell to the 30,000 yuan mark and stopped, finally falling by 2,000 yuan. Other yarns fell by 500 yuan to 2,000 yuan each.</p>
<p>The cloth market saw a slight decline. Credit in the market was generally tight, sales to customers were slow, and many dealers were selling goods due to demand. Longtou fine cloth opened at 1,320 yuan, and then rose to the noon closing price of 1,410 yuan of the previous day due to purchases by the Cantonese gang. The market trend was stagnant near noon, and finally closed at 1,350 yuan, falling by 60 yuan. The prices of middle-grade fine cloth each fell by 50 yuan to 100 yuan. Sijunzi yuan bījī opened in the morning at 1,200 yuan, and once rose slightly to 1,255 yuan. The noon closing price was 1,240 yuan, falling by 60 yuan. Sijunzi yuan zhígòng fell by 80 yuan, closing at 1,290 yuan. The prices of 190 high-grade 士林 and other colored cloths mostly remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>China Textile Sold More Than 10,000 Bolts of Cloth; Central Bank Also Sold Yarn as Usual</h3>
<p>China Textile sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 455 warehouse receipts, totaling 18,340 bolts, 940 bed sheets, and 17,400 pounds of rags, totaling 24,093,300 gold yuan. The prices were: 12-pound Da Ling Special First Grade Fine Cloth 1,050 yuan, B30-yard bījī坯 880 yuan, Japanese 30-yard Yarn bījī 柸 750 yuan, Japanese 30-yard Zhígòng 呢 柸 940 yuan, B40-yard 6000-count 10-pound 柸 cloth 1,400 yuan, Sijunzi yuan bījī 1,235 yuan, Hongguang Fine Yuan Yarn Damask 1,200 yuan, Second Grade Printed bījī 1,200 yuan, Second Grade Printed Cloth 750 yuan, Lotus Lady Flower Western Spinning 950 yuan, Beautiful Picture 1015·1018 Printed bījī 13550 yuan.</p>
<p>It also sold 125 pieces of yarn on behalf of the Central Bank, amounting to 3,687,500 yuan, with two types, 20-count Jincheng and 20-count Feihu, both at 29,500 yuan.</p>
<p>It also sold 91 pieces of yarn on behalf of the US Aid Association, with a price of 48,000 yuan per piece of 42-count double-strand, totaling 4,368,000 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk, First Low Then High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market saw prices rise and then fall. Prices of various outside commodities initially rose and then retreated. Foreign exchange transfer certificates also showed a slight pullback. Market sentiment was weak, further exacerbated by tight credit conditions, with the unofficial market interest rate rising to 50 yuan. Many holders took the opportunity to sell at higher prices. Spot transactions were scattered, leading to a languid market atmosphere.</p>
<p>"120" brand raw silk from Tianwu opened at 480,000 yuan in the morning. After the opening, news of strong foreign exchange boosted market sentiment slightly, and asking prices rose by a thousand yuan. However, large traders took the opportunity to unload at higher prices, and smaller players followed suit. Buyers immediately turned cautious, and the market retreated again, finally closing slightly lower at 480,000 yuan, down 2,000 yuan. Dongyang, Jin San, Masnia, and others all showed weakness.</p>
<p>Raw silk prices yesterday were soft due to the retreat of artificial silk, leading to sluggish silk fabric prices. Foreign trade companies had not yet opened their orders for export goods, and the market was also weak. Domestic silk weaving companies were inactive in placing orders, and industry credit remained tight. Trading on the market was quiet, and prices fell immediately after the opening. Grade D, 7-8 degree even white filature silk was initially priced at 550,000 yuan, with few transactions. Selling pressure increased, and asking prices continued to decline, reaching a low of 530,000 yuan. Near noon, those who were short of orders had arranged to cover their positions, and the eagerness to sell eased slightly. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to absorb supply, and the market recovered after the initial decline, finally closing at 540,000 yuan, down 5,500 yuan from the previous noon closing. Other grades followed suit with smaller declines.</p>
<p>Silk fabrics were weak yesterday due to the soft prices of raw silk and artificial silk. Prices of various outside commodities retreated in tandem. Market sentiment was nervous, with more selling than buying. Trading opened at lower prices, and prices rebounded slightly at the close. Meiya quilt covers opened lower at 271,000 yuan, then traders stepped in to push prices up. Short sellers rushed to cover, and order books seemed strong. Asking prices rose gradually, hovering around 290,000 yuan. Then smaller players took profits, and the market weakened again, with prices fluctuating up and down. Finally, industry credit conditions eased slightly after being tight, and market sentiment became volatile again. Prices initially stabilized and then rose, closing near noon at 293,000 yuan. Huaqiang closed at 292,000 yuan, both down over 2,000 yuan from the previous noon closing. Dacheng crepe remained unchanged, while Dawei wool was down 100 yuan, Xiaowu yuan was down 5 yuan, and Siwei wool rose slightly by 3-5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Bounces Slightly From Low</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tung oil market returned to a meandering pattern. Although sellers continued to support prices from morning till close, the sudden tightening of credit and the lack of buying interest made it impossible to continue the rally. As a result, the market was similar to the previous day, and the low level was not firmly established.</p>
<h3>Year-End Approaching, North-South Goods Sales Strong</h3>
<p>With the end of the lunar year approaching, trade in North-South goods and seafood has been exceptionally strong in recent days. Although seafood arrivals are plentiful, sales are also high. Other North-South goods are in short supply due to transportation disruptions. Dried noodles, longan, and other items have risen by two to three times.</p>
<p>It is also reported that vegetable arrivals have decreased due to cold weather, rising prices at the source, and transportation difficulties. Sales have also increased significantly due to the year-end season. According to industry insiders, this is a common pattern every year and there are no special factors.</p>
<h3>Import Quota Allocation Details for the Seventh and Eighth Seasons Announced Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Import Control Commission announced the following details of import quota allocations for various regions for the seventh and eighth seasons (from the 37th year to January of the 38th year): Aniline and other coal tar dyes: US$3,549,02; Chemicals: US$3,943,360; Unspecified paper: US$187,310; Cigarette paper: US$1,478,760; Metal products: US$6,900,877; Unspecified oils and waxes: US$691,503; Tannic acid: US$212,942; Medicines: US$788,671; India rubber: US$2,957,519; Hemp sacks (including those approved for export reimbursement): US$276,033; Additional approved quota for South China: US$2,130,999; Additional approved quota for North China: US$700,000; Total: US$23,716,999.

<h3>Winter in Bengbu</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Report from Bengbu, 2nd of this month] During my fifty days in Bengbu, I witnessed the beginning or end of the Xuzhou Campaign and the Bengbu-Suxian Campaign. Today, with a brief respite from the drums of war, I reflect on the evolution of events and am filled with emotion. It is undeniable that in these two major campaigns in northern Anhui, the National Army had gains, but also setbacks. Today, the authorities have decided on a strategy of firmly defending the Huai River as a barrier to the capital. The situation is certainly serious, but there are lessons to be learned from the failures. The countless problems hidden in the front and the rear, or between the upper and lower levels, are worthy of our deep thought and review.</p>
<p>According to what I have seen, from the fall of Suxian to the National Army's retreat to the Huai River, Bengbu itself has always been so quiet and calm. Although there was some turmoil in the middle, it was entirely due to poor human planning. For example, at the end of November, the National Army's Li and Huang army corps, affected by the loss of Lingbi, originally planned to join forces in Suxian, but instead retreated all the way to the south bank of the North Fei River. Cao Lao Ji was lost, and at night, standing on a three-story building, one could see the fires of the battlefield thirty miles away. The people of Bengbu were originally indifferent, but they could not withstand the fact that the entire staff of the municipal government, the municipal council, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Central Bank had all fled. Mayor Li Renqiao remained alone in the municipal government, as he could not leave. The Chamber of Commerce had no one in charge for six days, and re-elections were held. Later, when the situation stabilized, the people who had fled all returned. A slogan appeared on the streets of Bengbu: "Bengbu is as solid as a rock, welcome Chen Xiewu and Guo Huawu back in triumph!" (Chen Xiewu is the former chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Guo Huawu is the manager of the Bengbu branch of the Central Bank.) This is the humor of the people of Huaishang. Furthermore, a week ago, it was rumored in Bengbu that Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi had already left Bengbu and returned south, and everyone was preparing to move. The news was spread by the deputy mayor of the municipal government, and a section chief of a certain pacification area also mentioned it to me. It was not until Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi led Hu Fo, the deputy commander of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Border Area Suppression, in spending two consecutive days inspecting various agencies in the city that the rumors subsided.</p>
<p>The Most Loyal Sons of the Huai River</p>
<p>The day after the Jinghu Comfort Mission arrived in Bengbu, Shao En, the secretary-general of the Bengbu City Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, proposed at a public banquet for the mission that the cost of Bengbu's city defense works was too great for the people to bear, and that the defense of Bengbu was not only for the sake of Bengbu, but was related to the overall situation, so its expenses should be borne by the people of the whole country, and should not be borne solely by the people of Bengbu. Representative Zhao Hui Tan immediately stated that he would often raise it in the Yuan Hui after returning to Beijing. Later, Shao Hua, representing the National Comforting Association, also spoke a few words in the capacity of a native of Huaibei. He said: The brave men of Huaishang have a glorious history in the past, and the achievements of the Han and Ming dynasties represented by Liu Bang and Zhu Yuanzhang are excellent proof. However, today the brave men of Huaishang have become an "old ox pulling a broken cart," which can be used, but if not used well, it will be dragged down. He hopes that those who are leading the brave men of Huaishang today will use them well. The brave men of Huaishang are the most loyal, and anyone can whip them and spur them on. Whoever can use them well is their loyal worker. Mr. Shao's remarks won a round of applause.</p>
<p>Not counting the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Suppression of Rebellion has been fought for three years, and today the issue of who bears the burden of the war has become a problem for discussion, which is our sorrow. General Yu Zhaolong, the commander of the Bengbu Garrison, once expressed the view that today's war is a war of the whole nation, and the responsibility for paying for it should not be limited to the war zone, nor should it be limited to a certain class. He is powerless to break down this kind of prejudice, and he can only urge the people of Bengbu to save as much as possible.</p>
<p>Soldiers Break Through With Weapons</p>
<p>In the three years I have spent running around the battlefields between the rivers, I have been most deeply moved by this time in Bengbu. Three days after the Huang Wei Army Corps broke through, a battalion of more than thirty remaining soldiers, carrying their full complement of weapons, made their way to Bengbu to report for duty. They were resting by the side of the street, waiting to be received. A squad leader said, "If I don't die this time, I'll definitely have a few more good years to live." His clothes were wet, his feet were worn out, but he had no complaints. I also saw with my own eyes an old man bringing a pair of shoes and socks to a soldier whose feet were too sore to walk. The warm sympathy filled the scene I saw with humanity. Therefore, based on my intuition, today's morale is very usable, and today's people's hearts are not all dead. It only depends on whether the government can grasp it well and make good use of it in the future.</p>
